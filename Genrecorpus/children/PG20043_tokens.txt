stories
hepsa
and
genevieve
genevieve
lived
in
a
large
handsome
house
which
had
beautiful
gardens
all
about
it
she
had
no
brother
or
sister
but
she
had
a
large
filled
with
the
nicest
toys
so
that
a
good
many
children
who
came
to
play
in
it
thought
she
must
be
perfectly
happy
but
genevieve
had
often
thought
how
willingly
she
would
give
the
room
and
all
its
playthings
for
a
little
brother
of
her
own
whom
she
might
take
out
in
the
garden
for
a
walk
and
watch
carefully
just
as
her
mother
watched
her
one
day
while
she
was
walking
in
the
garden
thinking
of
the
little
brother
she
so
much
wanted
who
she
was
sure
would
look
like
her
dear
mother
with
her
blue
eyes
and
golden
curls
what
should
she
hear
but
the
noise
of
some
one
crying
outside
the
garden
fence
now
as
she
could
not
look
through
the
fence
for
it
was
quite
high
and
made
of
thick
boards
she
ran
quickly
to
the
gate
and
then
round
to
the
place
where
she
had
heard
the
crying
there
she
saw
a
little
girl
sitting
upon
the
with
bare
feet
and
legs
which
were
none
of
the
whitest
wearing
a
dress
of
brown
cloth
with
many
tatters
in
it
and
short
black
hair
hanging
over
her
face
and
head
genevieve
looked
at
her
in
amazement
dear
me
she
at
last
exclaimed
where
do
you
live
at
this
question
the
child
stopped
her
crying
and
pulling
away
her
hair
with
both
of
her
hands
from
her
face
disclosed
a
pair
of
large
black
eyes
which
swollen
with
tears
regarded
little
genevieve
with
sly
sleepy
wonder
it
was
not
wonderful
she
should
be
astonished
to
behold
so
neat
and
pretty
a
child
close
by
her
side
genevieve
wore
a
blue
frock
and
white
apron
neat
stockings
and
slippers
and
pantalettes
with
broad
ruffles
so
she
only
gazed
at
genevieve
without
dreaming
of
answering
her
question
what
is
your
name
asked
genevieve
what
is
yours
demanded
the
child
mine
is
genevieve
tell
me
what
yours
is
hepsa
do
you
live
in
there
and
hepsa
nodded
her
head
towards
the
fence
genevieve
replied
that
she
did
but
tell
me
why
you
were
crying
she
asked
because
tom
beat
my
black
cat
this
morning
and
threw
her
into
the
pond
and
she
was
everything
i
had
hepsa
burst
into
tears
again
and
little
genevieve
heart
was
so
filled
with
compassion
that
she
sat
down
upon
the
dirty
ground
at
the
side
of
the
afflicted
child
without
ever
thinking
of
the
blue
frock
and
clean
pantalettes
she
was
soiling
o
dear
dear
she
cried
shocked
at
tom
cruelty
how
wicked
he
was
what
made
him
do
so
your
brother
too
genevieve
thought
in
her
heart
that
little
brother
of
whom
she
so
often
thought
never
would
have
done
such
a
thing
hepsa
looked
up
half
angrily
as
she
replied
you
need
keep
telling
me
he
is
my
brother
i
sure
i
do
want
him
to
be
and
wish
he
was
i
do
love
him
a
bit
he
always
plagues
me
so
much
o
hepsa
do
say
so
pray
do
cried
genevieve
shocked
at
hepsa
passion
if
he
is
your
brother
you
ought
to
love
him
you
know
i
do
know
any
such
thing
i
tell
you
you
may
love
him
yourself
if
you
want
to
but
i
guess
when
he
kicks
you
and
beats
you
and
steals
your
things
and
knocks
your
down
you
wo
love
him
like
to
know
why
got
to
love
him
hepsa
demanded
this
of
genevieve
in
a
very
fierce
manner
because
he
is
your
brother
i
suppose
and
because
he
ought
to
be
good
and
perhaps
he
plagues
you
because
you
do
love
him
answered
genevieve
somewhat
perplexed
how
she
should
answer
the
question
thinking
in
her
own
heart
hepsa
had
a
very
wicked
brother
at
any
rate
she
continued
god
gave
him
to
you
and
i
have
read
how
he
tells
us
all
to
love
each
other
i
never
did
replied
hepsa
and
if
god
gave
tom
to
me
i
wish
take
him
back
for
i
do
want
him
why
hepsa
how
wicked
you
are
you
shall
not
talk
so
almost
shrieked
genevieve
the
tears
came
fast
into
her
eyes
she
was
so
grieved
to
hear
hepsa
talk
in
that
way
but
i
not
wicked
retorted
hepsa
indignantly
i
do
know
who
god
is
why
should
i
he
never
comes
to
see
me
i
suppose
he
comes
to
see
you
and
is
some
great
person
while
i
am
poor
and
live
in
a
mean
house
and
nobody
comes
to
see
me
of
course
hepsa
looked
away
from
genevieve
blue
frock
and
seemed
to
be
searching
for
something
away
down
the
street
genevieve
could
not
sit
still
any
longer
but
rising
she
remonstrated
with
hepsa
in
this
manner
god
is
not
a
man
hepsa
and
he
goes
into
poor
houses
as
often
as
into
rich
ones
hepsa
looked
very
sharply
upon
little
genevieve
as
she
replied
ha
do
you
be
telling
me
stories
why
do
i
see
him
ever
i
like
to
know
have
i
got
eyes
i
do
know
said
genevieve
doubtfully
father
was
reading
this
morning
about
people
who
had
eyes
but
could
not
see
hepsa
looked
at
her
a
moment
and
then
nodded
her
head
towards
her
and
said
speaking
low
as
to
a
third
person
she
cracked
a
little
i
think
then
as
she
looked
towards
the
fence
she
remembered
the
garden
which
was
behind
it
and
asked
genevieve
for
some
flowers
but
genevieve
only
said
o
yes
and
went
on
to
say
of
course
you
ca
see
god
hepsa
he
lives
in
the
skies
i
should
think
he
would
come
down
here
then
i
would
but
hepsa
god
loves
us
then
too
he
is
everywhere
at
once
mercy
said
hepsa
to
herself
in
a
low
tone
worse
and
worse
and
he
made
everything
you
see
hepsa
and
a
great
deal
more
beside
continued
genevieve
there
there
said
hepsa
impatiently
do
talk
any
more
it
sounds
odd
genevieve
looked
at
hepsa
and
the
wild
petulant
look
of
her
face
grieved
and
shocked
her
so
much
that
she
burst
into
tears
what
is
the
matter
said
hepsa
i
thought
you
were
going
to
get
me
the
flowers
and
so
i
will
said
genevieve
wiping
up
her
tears
as
well
as
she
could
and
she
ran
into
the
garden
and
picked
a
large
bunch
of
flowers
there
were
the
sweet
mignonette
and
heliotrope
the
pink
verbena
and
the
beautiful
white
scented
verbena
the
gay
phlox
the
pure
candytuft
bits
of
lemon
blossoms
and
the
faithful
pansies
it
was
such
a
beautiful
bunch
as
to
melt
poor
hepsa
heart
to
gratitude
i
do
think
i
should
love
to
kiss
you
she
said
to
genevieve
if
my
face
were
not
so
dirty
and
you
look
clean
i
do
care
said
genevieve
and
so
she
kissed
hepsa
and
said
hepsa
i
wish
you
would
never
again
talk
so
about
god
for
i
love
him
very
dearly
and
so
do
my
father
and
mother
hepsa
began
to
think
genevieve
was
not
crazy
and
so
she
became
more
serious
but
did
you
never
read
about
him
hepsa
asked
genevieve
no
indeed
i
ca
read
at
all
exclaimed
hepsa
astonished
at
genevieve
questions
not
read
why
hepsa
why
do
you
go
to
school
i
ca
mother
keeps
me
at
home
to
tend
the
baby
while
she
goes
to
washing
a
bright
thought
came
into
genevieve
little
head
where
do
you
live
she
asked
o
away
down
that
lane
the
other
side
of
the
village
i
work
nearly
all
the
time
some
way
or
other
have
you
any
father
yes
and
hepsa
looked
as
though
she
did
not
love
him
better
than
she
loved
tom
may
i
teach
you
to
read
asked
genevieve
looking
into
hepsa
eyes
entreatingly
the
child
turned
away
her
head
as
she
answered
i
have
any
time
i
have
to
stay
at
home
but
pursued
genevieve
i
come
down
to
your
house
and
bring
some
books
and
help
you
tend
the
baby
o
do
you
love
the
baby
no
he
is
cross
was
the
crusty
reply
but
he
is
a
baby
he
do
know
any
better
that
do
make
any
difference
yes
it
does
too
your
big
brother
knew
better
than
to
kill
your
pretty
pussy
and
that
is
why
it
was
so
naughty
in
him
to
do
it
this
was
a
new
kind
of
argument
for
hepsa
but
she
thought
over
it
a
moment
and
then
told
her
little
teacher
she
thought
she
might
be
right
i
almost
wish
you
would
come
to
teach
me
to
read
i
do
know
but
i
might
like
it
and
then
it
would
be
rather
good
to
see
you
now
are
you
sure
there
is
such
a
person
as
god
said
hepsa
glancing
at
genevieve
from
the
corners
of
her
eyes
of
course
i
am
hepsa
who
do
you
think
made
the
sky
and
the
ground
the
trees
and
grass
i
do
know
replied
hepsa
and
the
sun
and
the
moon
and
the
stars
continued
genevieve
with
a
mysterious
tone
hepsa
shook
her
head
by
way
of
saying
no
and
all
the
fathers
and
mothers
and
children
at
which
question
hepsa
looked
perplexed
i
asked
mother
once
she
said
musingly
who
made
all
these
things
but
she
told
me
i
better
be
minding
the
cradle
i
guess
she
know
but
i
always
had
spells
of
wondering
about
it
genevieve
looked
very
gravely
at
hepsa
as
she
said
it
was
god
who
made
all
these
things
well
i
do
know
but
it
was
replied
hepsa
but
i
it
was
the
bible
says
so
and
father
and
mother
say
so
too
beside
i
feel
it
in
my
heart
when
i
see
the
sun
and
the
flowers
and
everything
looks
so
pretty
do
you
cried
hepsa
seeming
to
feel
a
new
interest
in
her
companion
i
wonder
if
you
ever
hear
pretty
voices
in
the
trees
when
the
wind
blows
and
in
the
night
when
it
is
warm
and
you
are
looking
up
to
the
moon
and
see
the
light
that
comes
down
through
the
holes
in
the
sky
does
something
great
seem
to
come
close
to
you
why
yes
hepsa
ever
so
many
times
and
i
think
it
is
god
and
when
katie
leaves
me
to
go
to
sleep
and
it
is
all
dark
i
know
god
comes
then
for
i
feel
him
all
around
and
the
room
seems
so
big
bigger
than
it
ever
did
before
bigger
than
the
garden
bigger
than
the
fields
bigger
than
the
sky
i
ca
tell
you
how
big
o
well
and
what
did
you
say
your
name
was
asked
hepsa
genevieve
and
she
pronounced
it
very
slowly
it
is
rather
odd
said
hepsa
trying
to
repeat
the
name
but
i
want
to
know
if
you
ever
laid
down
on
the
ground
when
it
rained
and
listened
no
well
it
is
real
beautiful
in
the
grass
it
sounds
it
sounds
better
where
the
grass
is
tall
i
wish
i
could
hear
it
said
genevieve
sadly
but
my
mother
like
to
have
me
lie
on
the
ground
when
it
rained
how
would
she
know
it
asked
hepsa
if
you
did
tell
her
why
hepsa
i
should
want
to
if
she
would
like
it
i
want
to
at
all
i
suppose
then
she
wo
let
you
come
to
hear
me
read
o
yes
she
will
i
know
i
ask
her
and
she
will
kiss
me
and
say
yes
so
hepsa
told
her
where
she
lived
and
genevieve
went
into
the
house
and
hepsa
went
home
feeling
very
happy
about
the
flowers
and
thinking
of
the
things
her
new
friend
had
told
her
she
says
i
must
love
tom
and
that
is
so
queer
but
if
the
god
who
gave
me
tom
is
the
one
who
comes
so
near
to
me
sometimes
i
try
and
perhaps
if
i
had
called
tom
such
names
this
morning
he
have
killed
my
poor
cat
so
genevieve
words
had
sunk
into
heart
already
genevieve
went
to
her
mother
and
told
her
what
a
strange
little
girl
she
had
found
that
morning
and
that
she
had
promised
to
go
and
teach
her
to
read
that
she
might
know
about
god
illustration
genevieve
reading
the
bible
to
hepsa
on
the
next
day
she
took
some
of
her
books
and
with
some
of
her
prettiest
playthings
for
a
present
to
hepsa
she
went
in
search
of
the
house
down
the
lane
on
the
other
side
of
the
village
she
found
a
gentler
pupil
than
on
the
day
before
and
hepsa
hair
was
laid
smoothly
upon
her
forehead
her
face
clean
and
though
there
were
some
tatters
in
her
dress
genevieve
did
not
much
mind
them
the
baby
was
in
his
cradle
fast
asleep
and
genevieve
went
and
knelt
down
by
the
side
of
it
and
looked
at
it
carefully
as
though
she
was
afraid
of
awaking
it
and
then
whispered
to
hepsa
her
admiration
of
the
little
hands
which
lay
cunningly
upon
the
quilt
and
said
how
much
she
wanted
to
kiss
him
would
he
wake
she
wondered
if
she
just
kissed
his
cheek
and
did
make
any
noise
hepsa
told
her
no
so
she
kissed
him
and
then
after
looking
at
him
to
see
how
sweetly
he
slept
now
frowning
and
now
smiling
in
his
dreams
she
went
away
with
hepsa
and
they
talked
a
great
while
together
telling
each
other
what
the
other
did
know
genevieve
was
often
shocked
and
grieved
at
undutiful
remarks
about
her
father
mother
and
brother
and
when
she
felt
they
did
love
hepsa
as
her
own
dear
father
and
mother
loved
her
still
she
could
not
understand
why
hepsa
did
not
love
them
better
she
was
often
a
good
deal
perplexed
to
know
what
she
should
say
to
the
strange
child
but
of
one
thing
she
felt
always
certain
that
her
new
companion
needed
to
have
her
heart
cleansed
and
purified
before
she
could
be
loved
well
she
felt
a
strong
love
for
hepsa
and
longed
to
teach
her
more
of
god
and
show
her
how
to
read
that
she
might
teach
herself
hepsa
was
amazed
when
her
friend
took
out
the
playthings
from
the
bag
and
gave
them
to
her
no
one
had
before
shown
her
such
kindness
and
genevieve
thought
in
her
heart
she
was
just
as
happy
giving
those
things
to
hepsa
as
when
they
were
given
to
her
poor
hepsa
had
never
been
to
school
and
so
she
did
even
know
the
alphabet
but
genevieve
sat
down
patiently
to
teach
her
and
found
truly
that
much
patience
was
necessary
to
accomplish
the
work
she
had
undertaken
hepsa
would
soon
grow
discouraged
when
she
found
so
much
to
learn
and
saw
her
little
teacher
reading
so
readily
and
her
mother
would
often
scold
when
she
saw
hepsa
with
a
book
in
her
hand
declaring
it
was
foolish
nonsense
but
as
time
went
on
and
the
first
difficulties
were
overcome
and
her
mother
began
to
find
hepsa
growing
very
gentle
and
tom
had
less
occasion
to
plague
his
sister
they
all
felt
that
the
books
hepsa
had
studied
and
the
little
girl
who
came
so
often
to
see
her
were
kind
friends
and
love
began
to
bind
them
all
together
hepsa
no
longer
wore
torn
clothes
genevieve
mother
had
given
her
some
neat
dresses
and
genevieve
had
given
her
needles
and
thread
and
taught
her
to
sew
and
now
many
a
rent
was
carefully
mended
and
even
tom
began
to
look
neater
than
formerly
she
was
careful
too
to
keep
the
room
nicely
and
one
day
was
amply
rewarded
for
this
when
tom
came
in
before
she
had
had
time
to
do
it
and
complained
of
its
being
dirty
tom
begins
to
like
a
clean
room
she
said
to
herself
with
joy
and
received
his
few
harsh
words
as
though
they
had
been
those
of
love
the
baby
too
was
always
clean
for
she
knew
genevieve
always
depended
upon
kissing
him
hepsa
father
was
not
a
good
man
he
was
unkind
to
his
poor
wife
and
children
so
it
was
no
wonder
tom
had
gone
on
following
the
example
constantly
placed
before
him
but
he
was
a
child
yet
and
when
he
saw
how
hepsa
began
to
love
him
that
she
grieved
without
being
angry
when
he
was
unkind
to
her
it
could
not
but
touch
his
heart
he
was
half
ashamed
too
when
she
saved
for
him
some
of
the
good
things
genevieve
had
brought
her
at
first
is
true
he
thought
little
about
it
but
when
often
after
he
had
been
so
ugly
to
her
she
came
just
the
same
and
offered
him
half
of
her
orange
or
a
part
of
her
nuts
he
began
to
feel
that
he
was
a
naughty
boy
and
that
hepsa
was
better
than
she
used
to
be
it
was
very
natural
he
should
ask
her
the
reason
of
this
and
very
natural
too
that
she
should
answer
in
this
way
why
tom
i
have
learned
a
great
deal
about
god
from
genevieve
and
then
she
has
taught
me
to
read
and
i
have
learned
a
great
deal
that
way
tom
where
do
you
think
susan
went
when
she
died
tom
could
tell
susan
was
an
elder
sister
of
theirs
whom
they
had
loved
very
dearly
and
who
had
died
some
two
years
before
well
tom
there
are
angels
who
take
all
the
children
as
soon
as
they
die
and
show
them
wonderful
things
and
teach
them
so
they
can
go
into
a
beautiful
place
called
heaven
and
live
with
god
well
if
you
begin
to
be
good
here
and
love
people
you
will
go
into
that
heaven
sooner
when
you
die
than
if
you
are
naughty
and
do
think
about
these
things
while
you
are
here
i
want
to
go
there
very
much
and
so
i
try
to
be
good
though
i
do
always
make
out
well
tom
looked
thoughtful
at
his
sister
words
and
then
said
i
think
that
little
genevieve
will
go
very
fast
when
she
dies
but
i
do
think
father
will
get
there
very
soon
now
i
tell
you
o
but
tom
said
hepsa
sadly
we
must
not
think
who
will
not
go
but
how
may
go
i
wish
i
knew
how
to
read
said
tom
but
i
never
can
go
to
school
father
makes
me
saw
so
much
wood
then
hepsa
asked
him
to
let
her
teach
him
and
after
a
good
deal
of
hesitation
he
told
her
he
did
care
if
she
did
some
time
after
this
genevieve
father
and
mother
went
away
from
that
place
and
she
parted
from
hepsa
with
many
tears
in
her
eyes
and
much
grief
in
her
heart
if
i
never
see
you
again
she
said
do
forget
we
are
both
going
into
the
gardens
up
there
and
hepsa
always
remembered
genevieve
was
a
very
quiet
girl
but
she
was
always
ready
to
do
something
to
please
her
dear
mother
and
at
night
brought
her
slippers
from
the
closet
and
placed
them
ready
by
his
chair
she
did
too
many
little
things
for
the
servants
who
all
loved
her
very
dearly
so
when
a
few
years
afterwards
she
fell
sick
and
nothing
they
could
do
for
her
was
able
to
make
her
any
better
but
the
doctor
said
she
must
die
they
all
wept
very
much
and
no
comfort
or
joy
could
come
into
their
hearts
but
genevieve
gently
kissed
them
and
told
them
a
beautiful
peace
had
come
into
her
heart
for
that
in
the
night
christ
often
came
to
her
and
told
her
how
the
angel
was
all
ready
to
take
her
into
his
beautiful
garden
and
teach
her
out
of
his
great
golden
books
at
last
one
morning
she
died
and
they
laid
her
away
in
the
garden
near
by
the
fountain
and
they
planted
the
mignonette
and
myrtle
that
mingling
with
the
moss
it
might
grow
over
her
grave
and
her
mother
said
in
her
heart
let
her
lie
here
that
as
often
as
i
come
hither
i
may
be
reminded
of
the
more
beautiful
gardens
of
god
to
which
she
has
flown
and
when
in
the
cool
night
the
stars
look
down
the
soft
fragrance
of
the
mignonette
shall
tell
them
of
her
loveliness
and
the
myrtle
and
the
moss
of
the
constant
love
twining
together
the
souls
of
the
mother
and
the
daughter
it
was
as
christ
had
said
the
angel
stood
ready
and
when
genevieve
closed
her
eyes
in
death
he
caught
her
in
his
arms
and
placed
her
before
the
great
gate
which
led
into
the
gardens
around
the
kingdom
of
heaven
a
great
many
men
women
and
children
stood
about
it
waiting
for
it
to
be
opened
when
suddenly
a
very
bright
angel
brighter
than
any
she
had
ever
seen
in
her
dreams
came
among
them
seated
on
glorious
clouds
then
one
by
one
did
the
crowd
go
before
him
telling
him
what
things
they
had
done
on
earth
in
order
to
be
admitted
into
the
gardens
to
be
prepared
still
more
for
the
heavens
one
said
he
had
built
a
large
college
given
it
a
large
sum
of
money
and
called
it
by
his
name
that
the
world
might
see
his
works
and
praise
the
lord
another
told
him
how
he
had
toiled
in
heathen
lands
and
dwelt
among
savages
that
they
might
know
and
love
god
another
that
he
had
prophesied
another
that
he
had
built
a
hospital
for
the
poor
and
had
sheltered
them
from
the
cold
winds
another
still
that
he
had
delivered
slaves
from
cruel
masters
and
brought
them
to
the
light
of
freedom
o
there
can
not
be
counted
all
the
men
and
women
who
came
before
the
angel
and
told
of
the
things
they
had
accomplished
and
as
the
words
came
upon
genevieve
her
heart
trembled
for
fear
and
had
it
not
been
for
the
remembrance
of
those
kind
tones
of
christ
poor
genevieve
would
have
shrieked
aloud
what
should
she
do
rapidly
she
recalled
every
act
of
her
life
but
nowhere
in
it
could
she
find
one
act
worthy
to
be
brought
before
the
great
bright
angel
alas
she
had
neither
founded
colleges
nor
hospitals
she
had
never
toiled
in
heathen
lands
nor
prophesied
nor
delivered
slaves
from
bondage
alas
must
she
lose
those
gardens
when
still
so
near
the
angel
glance
fell
upon
genevieve
and
she
drooped
down
in
fear
but
what
was
her
surprise
when
the
angel
came
down
from
the
cloud
and
raising
her
up
said
in
tones
of
loving
cadence
look
little
one
thy
work
was
accepted
long
ago
and
looking
as
he
bade
her
she
saw
hepsa
at
her
side
to
whom
so
long
ago
she
had
spoken
of
heaven
when
she
had
found
her
a
dirty
ignorant
girl
you
have
worked
well
said
the
angel
tenderly
go
now
into
the
garden
and
ere
long
i
will
come
to
put
you
into
the
christ
arms
so
hepsa
and
genevieve
together
walked
through
the
gates
and
the
angels
who
would
be
their
teachers
went
with
them
but
i
can
not
tell
you
of
the
beauty
and
glory
of
those
scenes
i
only
beg
you
too
to
work
well
that
the
angel
may
speak
as
lovingly
to
you
the
garden
of
god
or
the
baby
first
smile
in
a
very
lovely
little
cottage
around
which
grew
and
and
up
whose
windows
climbed
honeysuckles
and
jessamines
lived
a
mother
with
her
baby
the
mother
was
a
young
woman
with
golden
hair
kind
blue
eyes
and
fair
white
skin
there
was
always
a
look
of
love
in
her
eye
and
in
the
gentle
tones
of
her
voice
the
most
soothing
tenderness
people
said
the
baby
looked
like
her
but
he
cried
so
much
that
his
face
was
continually
distorted
and
so
the
resemblance
was
not
of
any
use
to
him
now
there
was
a
great
deal
of
discussion
about
the
baby
looks
as
to
which
he
most
resembled
his
father
or
mother
some
decided
in
favor
of
his
father
who
was
a
tall
man
with
black
hair
and
black
eyes
and
large
sharp
features
it
was
a
difficult
question
to
answer
inasmuch
as
the
baby
had
yet
but
a
very
few
hairs
on
his
head
and
his
features
were
not
easily
distinguishable
and
as
each
person
decision
affected
only
his
own
opinion
there
was
a
great
deal
of
discussion
and
comparing
of
the
poor
baby
little
face
with
those
of
his
parents
and
through
dint
of
being
often
shown
them
the
father
and
mother
began
to
find
the
most
remarkable
resemblance
to
each
other
in
their
little
child
well
one
day
he
had
been
crying
very
hard
and
his
poor
mother
was
nearly
worn
sick
with
trying
to
quiet
him
she
had
walked
all
over
the
house
shown
him
everything
on
the
tables
taken
up
books
and
shaken
them
before
his
eyes
carried
him
to
the
windows
and
cried
see
there
see
there
with
fresh
tones
of
love
and
pity
without
his
seeming
to
be
in
the
least
edified
by
it
all
she
tossed
him
before
the
but
he
did
not
seem
to
be
comforted
by
the
glimpse
of
himself
done
up
in
a
blanket
which
he
caught
until
at
last
after
putting
everything
into
every
place
in
which
it
did
belong
and
trying
to
make
him
look
at
things
he
did
care
to
see
she
resolutely
put
him
in
the
cradle
rocked
him
with
his
head
moving
now
on
this
and
now
on
that
side
of
the
pillow
until
he
fell
fast
asleep
he
had
no
sooner
closed
his
eyes
to
sleep
than
he
left
his
baby
body
in
the
cradle
and
ran
straight
off
to
the
gardens
of
god
in
heaven
towards
that
place
where
dwell
the
who
are
yet
to
go
down
and
live
upon
the
earth
as
he
came
near
the
tall
flowers
whose
golden
petals
were
spread
and
in
whose
cups
lay
sweet
dew
he
clapped
his
hands
with
joy
and
a
bright
smile
lay
on
his
lips
which
before
had
been
distorted
with
grief
not
far
from
him
there
rose
a
bright
fountain
which
falling
dashed
its
water
gently
down
into
a
broad
silvery
basin
beneath
in
the
midst
of
the
falling
spray
a
large
bird
with
long
blue
plumage
played
now
diving
beneath
the
water
and
now
catching
the
drops
as
they
fell
from
the
fountain
then
came
other
birds
some
in
gay
scarlet
plumage
with
white
feathers
about
their
necks
and
at
the
tips
of
their
wings
and
tails
they
too
played
in
the
fountain
and
chased
each
other
over
the
sparkling
waters
then
there
were
tall
trees
of
such
a
bright
green
as
is
seldom
seen
on
the
earth
and
on
them
were
fruits
which
looked
a
little
like
those
we
see
here
but
a
thousand
times
more
beautiful
for
they
shone
like
precious
stones
about
everything
was
a
glory
which
it
is
impossible
to
describe
at
a
little
distance
was
a
troop
of
fair
children
at
play
and
when
they
had
seen
the
little
child
from
the
earth
they
ran
towards
him
and
would
have
kissed
him
joyously
but
that
they
saw
the
tears
he
had
so
recently
shed
still
standing
upon
his
cheeks
at
this
sorrow
shone
over
their
faces
and
tears
like
pearls
entered
their
own
eyes
as
in
the
tenderest
manner
they
asked
him
the
cause
of
his
grief
do
not
ask
me
dear
brothers
and
sisters
he
entreated
i
wish
only
to
think
how
i
am
with
you
now
for
a
little
while
and
i
long
to
forget
the
speaking
thus
he
kissed
them
all
and
led
them
away
off
among
the
bright
fields
very
gayly
they
played
a
long
time
they
plucked
the
golden
apples
from
the
trees
and
threw
them
far
up
in
the
sky
and
the
apples
bounded
so
lightly
that
they
still
went
on
till
at
last
they
dropped
down
to
the
earth
into
some
dark
rooms
where
poor
people
lived
who
when
they
found
them
rejoiced
exceedingly
then
they
went
riding
on
the
clouds
and
the
light
of
their
faces
gave
a
brightness
to
the
edge
of
the
clouds
so
that
the
people
on
the
earth
loved
to
stand
watching
them
never
fancying
what
a
troop
of
were
frolicking
on
them
at
last
they
became
weary
of
this
sport
and
bent
their
way
quite
towards
the
earth
at
this
our
saddened
and
did
not
wing
his
flight
as
quickly
as
the
others
did
upon
this
they
looked
around
upon
him
and
said
why
tarry
you
do
you
not
know
we
go
to
the
earth
to
do
there
what
our
dear
teacher
bids
us
you
have
played
with
us
and
will
you
not
now
do
the
work
which
you
have
so
often
done
with
us
before
so
he
sped
on
with
them
but
his
voice
was
silent
and
his
heart
wept
they
soon
came
to
the
earth
and
then
unseen
by
any
one
they
made
their
way
towards
a
little
dingy
house
in
one
room
of
which
sat
a
little
boy
upon
a
bench
driving
pegs
into
the
sole
of
a
boot
on
one
side
lay
all
the
boots
in
which
he
had
driven
pegs
and
on
the
other
a
great
many
more
in
which
he
must
still
drive
them
he
looked
sad
and
pale
and
the
sweat
lay
in
large
drops
upon
his
forehead
by
his
side
sat
a
large
stout
man
with
his
rolled
up
displaying
strong
brawny
arms
while
his
face
was
red
and
stern
he
was
also
at
work
but
watched
the
boy
well
and
if
he
saw
his
arm
rested
for
a
moment
he
would
give
him
a
little
push
bidding
him
mind
his
work
and
so
the
poor
boy
had
to
drive
the
pegs
into
the
soles
of
the
boots
even
though
he
was
weary
and
his
face
pale
and
sad
then
the
seized
with
one
feeling
of
love
and
pity
for
they
could
remember
how
the
poor
boy
used
to
be
one
of
them
and
play
in
the
garden
of
god
soared
above
him
one
came
down
and
wiped
off
the
drops
of
sweat
from
his
brow
another
passed
his
soft
hands
over
the
boy
face
and
rested
him
and
another
put
comforting
thoughts
into
his
soul
then
the
master
looked
up
and
when
he
saw
how
the
boy
seemed
suddenly
refreshed
he
told
him
it
was
good
to
work
and
silly
to
be
tired
and
when
the
boy
heard
these
hard
words
tears
came
into
his
eyes
and
he
thought
of
his
mother
who
used
so
tenderly
to
care
for
him
but
had
now
been
gone
long
to
the
home
of
the
angels
then
some
of
the
wiped
away
the
tears
which
had
come
into
the
boy
eyes
and
another
shook
his
beautiful
wings
over
his
head
so
that
at
once
a
cool
breeze
fell
over
him
and
hopeful
words
entered
his
soul
some
of
the
children
moved
his
arm
up
and
down
as
he
drove
the
pegs
into
the
boot
and
he
wondered
how
easily
he
was
able
to
work
all
this
time
our
stood
apart
nodding
his
head
sadly
and
when
the
others
asked
him
the
cause
he
answered
o
you
do
not
know
how
hard
it
is
to
live
on
the
earth
see
this
poor
boy
how
far
different
was
it
with
him
when
he
played
with
us
in
the
gardens
up
there
the
children
were
silent
they
knew
not
how
to
comfort
him
they
thought
too
of
the
time
when
they
should
live
on
the
earth
then
they
flew
along
and
came
to
a
large
city
in
which
lived
many
homeless
children
who
were
led
about
by
unkind
and
evil
spirits
and
passed
constantly
by
men
and
women
who
did
not
so
much
as
give
them
one
kind
word
as
the
wandered
among
them
they
shuddered
such
strange
words
filled
the
air
and
so
dark
and
dingy
looked
the
houses
where
they
went
in
and
out
could
it
be
that
these
children
who
talked
together
in
angry
moods
who
rather
sought
the
opportunity
to
trouble
each
other
had
ever
played
in
that
fountain
and
laughed
together
in
the
heavenly
fields
o
they
sighed
could
we
but
once
drive
the
evil
spirits
from
one
of
them
and
whisper
in
his
ear
of
the
kind
love
of
god
then
their
wings
fluttered
and
folded
themselves
over
the
head
of
a
large
boy
whose
clothes
were
dirty
and
tattered
his
hair
matted
and
disordered
his
body
thin
and
wan
while
the
expression
of
his
face
was
very
old
and
vacant
a
slight
girl
holding
a
little
pail
in
her
hand
came
along
near
him
and
made
as
if
she
would
go
by
him
but
the
boy
would
not
suffer
her
to
pass
on
and
stopping
her
said
to
her
well
and
what
have
you
got
the
child
looked
at
him
fearfully
and
remained
silent
but
the
boy
did
not
heed
her
look
but
proceeded
to
lay
hold
of
her
pail
in
which
she
had
had
hot
corn
to
sell
and
opening
it
discovered
there
six
pennies
instead
ah
he
cried
exultingly
that
is
what
i
wanted
you
have
done
well
with
your
corn
you
may
go
on
now
and
despite
the
poor
child
cries
he
took
away
the
pennies
and
in
resisting
the
little
struggle
the
child
was
able
to
make
he
threw
her
down
upon
the
pavement
this
was
in
a
dark
street
filled
with
people
wicked
like
this
boy
and
where
was
no
one
who
cared
to
take
the
child
part
but
those
were
silent
witnesses
of
this
scene
and
they
put
out
their
hands
so
the
little
girl
was
not
much
hurt
in
her
fall
then
they
looked
at
each
other
in
dismay
the
pearly
tears
again
came
into
their
bright
eyes
and
they
asked
each
other
what
they
might
do
for
this
wretched
boy
they
remembered
when
the
boy
and
girl
played
together
in
the
fair
garden
of
god
and
it
was
not
possible
for
them
to
remember
that
and
look
unmoved
upon
this
fearful
change
which
had
come
over
him
o
this
is
a
sad
murmured
the
baby
spirit
and
he
nodded
his
head
again
in
sorrow
why
may
not
i
too
become
like
this
boy
but
the
bring
this
change
asked
another
of
the
who
saw
the
anguish
of
his
friend
but
knew
not
how
to
comfort
him
do
we
not
remember
the
poor
boy
who
worked
so
hard
and
had
no
rest
yet
he
was
patient
and
good
and
kept
bright
and
hung
the
cord
which
tied
his
soul
to
heaven
with
the
which
fell
for
his
dear
dead
mother
when
tried
he
gave
back
no
hard
words
he
was
better
than
we
who
are
happy
always
and
have
no
trials
not
long
after
they
found
the
wicked
boy
asleep
he
had
thrown
himself
down
in
the
corner
of
a
dirty
alley
on
a
little
straw
the
children
hovered
over
him
trying
how
they
might
approach
him
they
drove
hence
the
dark
spirits
one
by
one
who
hindered
their
approach
and
then
they
carried
him
off
by
the
in
a
dream
they
made
him
sit
upon
the
sand
and
listen
to
the
roaring
of
the
waters
the
large
rocks
stood
scattered
on
the
beach
and
the
and
shells
were
thrown
up
by
the
waves
afar
off
upon
the
water
he
saw
a
long
line
of
bright
clouds
which
seemed
to
climb
up
to
heaven
to
meet
the
bright
twinkling
stars
the
moonlight
shone
softly
down
upon
him
then
they
laid
him
down
upon
the
sand
and
made
him
look
up
into
the
sky
to
feel
the
rest
and
peace
of
it
still
more
came
the
moonlight
upon
him
and
the
stars
seemed
to
open
and
close
their
eyes
for
pity
the
wind
came
towards
him
and
passed
along
his
brow
and
over
his
heart
then
came
into
his
soul
an
indescribable
longing
such
as
he
had
never
felt
before
a
longing
which
the
noise
of
the
sea
the
beauty
of
the
clouds
the
peace
of
the
sky
and
the
tenderness
of
the
wind
had
aroused
in
him
he
felt
that
something
inexpressibly
dear
had
been
lost
to
him
and
he
feared
never
again
to
regain
it
the
quiet
moon
and
the
pitying
stars
made
him
fear
a
deep
grief
entered
his
heart
and
he
wept
as
from
an
everlasting
sorrow
as
he
wept
the
angels
rejoiced
and
hovered
over
his
head
in
a
halo
of
light
for
they
knew
that
these
tears
would
bring
him
into
the
path
that
led
to
heaven
not
far
off
lived
a
man
who
cared
for
destitute
and
ignorant
children
the
flew
to
bring
him
and
when
the
boy
opened
his
eyes
in
which
the
tears
of
repentance
still
lay
the
ocean
and
bright
clouds
had
disappeared
but
there
was
bent
upon
him
a
pitying
benignant
look
which
went
to
the
boy
heart
and
a
kind
voice
lingered
in
his
ear
subduing
him
by
its
very
strangeness
so
he
at
once
received
the
proffered
hand
and
arose
and
went
with
him
to
his
home
after
that
the
went
into
a
splendid
mansion
where
in
a
large
handsome
chamber
lay
a
little
girl
suffering
under
severe
pain
her
little
couch
was
hung
in
blue
silk
and
rich
laces
adorned
her
pillows
on
a
little
table
by
the
side
of
her
bed
stood
golden
goblets
to
refresh
her
parched
mouth
with
pleasant
drinks
yet
still
the
little
girl
moaned
in
pain
her
eyelids
were
closed
and
her
weary
hand
lay
still
upon
the
bed
at
her
side
sat
her
nurse
watching
her
wants
and
longing
to
relieve
them
costly
toys
lay
uncared
for
on
the
rich
heavy
carpet
the
flowers
had
lost
their
charm
the
delicious
fruit
lay
full
and
ripe
neglected
on
their
dish
sleep
would
not
come
to
the
child
weary
and
in
pain
she
had
laid
there
a
long
long
time
her
poor
little
body
wasting
slowly
away
towards
the
grave
let
us
give
her
rest
and
comfort
said
the
and
waving
their
wings
over
her
she
fell
to
sleeping
the
nurse
said
then
there
might
be
hope
listen
and
hear
what
bright
hope
there
was
indeed
they
whispered
to
her
that
soon
her
pain
should
cease
and
that
for
her
trust
and
patience
she
should
go
to
god
beautiful
garden
they
showed
her
the
fountains
and
the
birds
they
told
her
how
she
should
again
ride
upon
the
clouds
and
study
from
the
great
books
of
god
then
in
her
sleep
she
smiled
and
the
nurse
who
was
watching
her
face
wept
for
joy
and
exclaimed
there
is
hope
there
is
hope
yes
there
was
hope
when
the
little
girl
awoke
there
was
a
more
heavenly
patience
still
in
her
soul
and
a
longing
to
meet
the
loving
glances
of
the
again
as
the
children
wended
their
flight
back
to
the
gardens
and
sat
down
beneath
the
green
trees
and
ate
of
their
delicious
fruit
they
strove
in
vain
to
bring
back
the
brightness
to
the
face
of
the
ah
it
would
be
so
beautiful
to
stay
with
you
he
said
i
would
like
always
to
comfort
these
afflicted
ones
but
alas
i
shall
need
comfort
myself
and
you
will
come
to
me
as
we
have
been
to
others
when
i
am
on
the
earth
there
seems
something
gone
and
lost
and
what
is
before
me
is
confused
and
dim
i
find
myself
so
weak
and
helpless
when
here
i
am
so
sprightly
and
strong
i
can
not
move
myself
at
all
and
when
i
remember
these
gardens
i
have
left
and
you
with
whom
i
have
played
i
can
but
cry
all
the
time
it
looks
cold
and
bleak
there
as
it
never
does
here
then
should
i
grow
up
to
be
wicked
like
those
children
we
have
seen
and
so
go
far
away
from
heaven
how
wretched
should
i
become
how
much
better
that
i
never
had
left
these
gardens
thus
he
complained
and
the
other
children
were
silent
for
they
knew
how
they
too
at
some
time
must
go
down
and
try
their
fortunes
upon
the
earth
and
too
they
sorrowed
to
lose
their
companion
for
they
knew
that
soon
he
could
not
come
to
them
any
more
and
while
they
told
him
very
eagerly
how
they
would
come
to
watch
over
him
a
soft
tread
fell
on
their
ears
and
their
dear
teacher
approached
them
her
hair
floated
in
long
curls
upon
the
cool
air
and
her
eyes
were
bent
down
in
sorrow
upon
the
have
you
so
soon
forgotten
the
lessons
you
have
learned
from
the
book
of
god
she
asked
and
the
tones
of
her
voice
were
like
the
soft
harmonies
of
heaven
she
held
in
her
hand
a
book
along
whose
pages
the
letters
sparkled
in
the
brightness
of
gold
and
silver
at
the
sight
of
her
the
threw
himself
at
her
feet
and
besought
her
thus
keep
me
with
you
dear
teacher
and
teach
me
from
your
book
why
should
i
go
to
the
again
tenderly
did
the
embrace
and
uplift
the
imploring
child
she
pointed
to
a
distant
part
of
the
garden
towards
a
grate
of
in
gold
silver
and
pearls
whence
issued
a
glorious
light
beyond
this
they
saw
angels
walking
in
their
hands
bearing
still
more
glorious
books
than
the
one
she
held
when
i
taught
you
long
ago
how
beautiful
was
the
life
there
how
the
love
did
you
not
long
to
go
thither
and
when
i
told
you
that
the
way
thither
was
only
through
the
earth
that
it
was
long
and
difficult
and
narrow
that
many
troubles
must
make
you
strong
to
walk
in
it
did
you
not
long
to
go
promising
not
to
complain
do
you
so
soon
falter
have
i
not
told
you
that
the
book
you
carry
in
your
hands
there
must
first
be
formed
on
the
earth
that
there
you
shall
pick
up
one
by
one
the
shining
letters
which
compose
it
why
do
you
complain
have
you
forgotten
that
your
home
is
better
than
those
miserable
ones
which
have
been
given
to
those
who
were
your
beloved
playmates
here
this
is
your
last
visit
to
the
garden
of
god
the
shall
come
and
whisper
to
you
in
your
dreams
and
when
they
in
their
turns
go
down
to
live
upon
the
earth
hold
your
arms
out
to
them
and
when
their
steps
are
weak
help
them
along
and
when
you
see
children
with
tattered
clothes
in
poor
cottages
look
not
proudly
on
your
own
but
remember
that
here
in
the
garden
of
god
you
played
together
in
the
same
fountain
drank
the
same
dew
and
think
no
more
of
yourself
or
your
beautiful
for
god
gave
it
to
you
for
the
same
purpose
he
gave
the
wretched
cottage
to
the
other
remember
too
the
good
mother
who
has
patiently
hushed
your
cries
and
will
yet
bear
you
through
many
dark
places
she
has
never
yet
tired
in
caring
for
you
and
you
have
given
her
little
else
but
trouble
go
be
henceforth
patient
and
loving
sorrow
came
into
the
heart
of
the
child
for
his
selfishness
and
as
he
thought
of
his
beautiful
mother
how
she
always
smiled
upon
him
and
would
help
him
to
heaven
his
heart
filled
up
with
love
to
her
at
that
moment
he
opened
his
eyes
and
there
by
his
side
sat
the
mother
watching
for
his
awaking
a
heavenly
smile
stole
over
his
features
and
he
held
up
his
arms
to
her
the
mother
caught
him
from
the
cradle
and
wept
over
him
in
the
ecstasy
of
a
joy
and
love
for
it
was
the
her
baby
had
given
her
cybele
the
tambourine
girl
cybele
was
a
little
girl
she
had
large
gray
eyes
and
brown
hair
smoothly
parted
over
her
forehead
while
there
was
a
pitiful
expression
round
her
mouth
that
pleaded
with
you
so
earnestly
you
could
scarce
help
stopping
as
you
met
her
to
give
her
a
few
pennies
her
real
home
was
not
in
this
country
long
ago
she
had
come
over
from
the
bright
land
of
italy
from
its
warm
sunny
skies
and
beautiful
gardens
where
the
birds
sang
so
joyfully
and
gay
music
sounded
on
the
air
all
which
she
longed
to
see
and
hear
again
and
as
all
things
there
had
been
so
beautiful
and
here
so
dreary
all
beauty
grew
to
be
the
same
thing
as
that
dear
italy
so
that
when
she
even
saw
flowers
in
the
window
of
some
lordly
house
she
would
stand
gazing
tearfully
through
them
at
the
home
cybele
mother
had
died
in
that
beautiful
land
and
it
was
in
one
of
its
lovely
gardens
her
body
rested
while
her
spirit
soared
heavenward
the
little
girl
knew
this
place
so
well
the
grew
about
it
and
the
song
of
the
waterfall
near
by
played
and
sparkled
in
the
tones
of
the
birds
but
cybele
aunt
had
taken
the
little
girl
with
her
to
this
distant
land
and
the
child
could
no
longer
go
and
weep
over
the
grave
where
her
mother
body
had
been
laid
but
her
heart
was
there
it
could
not
forget
she
dreamed
of
it
in
the
long
nights
and
when
she
played
upon
her
tambourine
the
remembrance
inspired
her
notes
making
people
love
to
listen
to
her
away
down
in
an
uncomfortable
part
of
the
city
dwell
a
great
many
poor
people
who
have
come
from
distant
countries
to
find
here
some
bread
which
may
keep
them
from
starving
the
streets
where
they
dwell
are
dirty
and
the
houses
look
smoky
and
wretched
there
are
queer
little
shops
with
oranges
and
cigars
bread
and
tobacco
in
the
windows
and
if
you
go
in
you
smell
yeast
and
see
standing
about
while
a
man
in
a
green
jacket
sells
you
what
you
ask
for
to
such
shops
do
the
people
near
by
come
for
their
bread
and
cent
worth
of
milk
to
such
a
shop
little
cybele
came
early
in
the
morning
and
late
at
night
and
so
dingy
looked
the
shops
and
people
that
her
aunt
room
seemed
bright
and
cheerful
in
comparison
this
room
nevertheless
was
small
and
quite
dark
having
but
one
window
which
looked
down
into
a
brown
but
her
aunt
kept
the
room
neat
and
clean
the
bed
stood
off
by
itself
in
one
corner
the
two
chairs
on
either
side
of
the
table
and
in
the
cupboard
were
a
few
plates
and
cups
with
which
the
scanty
table
was
spread
yet
was
this
room
dear
to
the
child
since
the
dreams
she
had
dreamed
there
hung
over
her
still
with
their
light
and
love
it
chanced
one
day
that
her
aunt
fell
sick
so
sick
as
to
be
obliged
to
lie
on
the
bed
for
a
long
time
she
had
not
been
able
to
do
any
hard
work
but
had
sat
at
home
and
made
little
brooms
for
cybele
to
take
out
with
her
when
she
went
to
play
the
tambourine
about
the
streets
and
cybele
had
seen
how
her
aunt
grew
pale
day
by
day
but
she
had
not
dreamed
the
time
would
come
when
her
aunt
must
lay
still
on
the
bed
for
weariness
with
a
heavy
heart
she
took
the
brooms
and
the
tambourine
and
went
out
hoping
to
get
a
few
pennies
and
bring
home
a
doctor
for
her
aunt
but
it
was
a
sad
day
for
cybele
she
was
rudely
sent
away
from
the
doors
at
which
she
stopped
and
though
she
stood
long
before
the
windows
of
lordly
houses
in
which
she
felt
were
many
persons
still
the
sashes
were
left
down
and
no
kind
group
appeared
to
encourage
her
so
she
passed
on
through
quiet
squares
and
noisy
streets
but
everywhere
met
with
a
repulse
what
should
she
do
it
was
impossible
to
go
home
without
money
she
thought
of
the
poor
aunt
who
was
sick
and
of
the
mother
who
lay
away
in
the
gardens
of
italy
and
new
courage
came
into
her
soul
a
gentleman
came
toward
her
with
ruddy
cheeks
and
smooth
rich
clothes
surely
he
will
not
turn
away
from
the
little
child
so
she
stepped
forward
and
when
he
came
near
she
looked
up
in
his
face
saying
please
sir
will
you
not
buy
one
of
my
brooms
but
he
brushed
by
her
unheeding
her
gentle
tones
and
leaving
her
eyes
filled
with
tears
then
came
along
a
careless
boy
whistling
a
merry
tune
and
with
his
hands
thrust
into
his
pockets
confidence
and
hope
made
her
ask
him
also
please
will
you
buy
a
broom
the
boy
stopped
and
still
whistling
looked
into
her
face
glanced
over
her
dress
tambourine
and
brooms
and
as
his
eyes
rested
upon
these
last
he
replied
buy
a
broom
pray
what
think
you
i
want
with
one
of
those
flimsy
things
and
then
he
looked
at
her
as
though
he
thought
her
so
absurd
cybele
was
abashed
by
his
manner
and
began
to
think
she
had
asked
him
to
do
a
very
foolish
thing
so
she
hurried
to
reply
i
do
know
i
sure
but
they
brush
away
flies
with
them
flies
he
repeated
contemptuously
at
the
same
time
taking
one
of
the
brooms
from
her
little
bundle
and
thrusting
it
about
him
in
all
conceivable
ways
pulling
open
the
brush
and
altogether
ruining
it
flies
it
is
getting
too
cool
for
flies
and
besides
my
mother
never
lets
any
get
into
the
house
so
it
no
use
any
way
why
do
you
go
home
it
a
shame
to
be
walking
round
the
streets
so
you
ought
to
be
in
school
or
at
work
or
something
else
illustration
cybele
the
tambourine
girl
i
do
know
how
to
do
anything
else
replied
cybele
the
blood
rushing
to
her
cheeks
my
aunt
is
sick
and
i
want
to
get
some
money
tush
always
sick
replied
the
boy
contemptuously
how
silly
i
wonder
the
beggars
do
all
die
some
day
they
been
sick
so
long
we
are
not
beggars
said
cybele
raising
her
head
somewhat
proudly
and
preparing
to
move
away
if
you
do
want
the
broom
i
take
it
if
you
please
the
boy
seemed
half
pleased
as
he
looked
at
her
and
said
proud
too
if
it
is
funny
here
do
go
away
i
want
to
hear
your
tambourine
so
she
laid
down
her
bundle
of
brooms
and
arranging
her
tambourine
played
him
some
merry
tunes
ca
you
dance
too
asked
the
boy
when
she
had
finished
so
she
danced
and
played
to
him
and
when
she
stopped
he
placed
a
penny
in
her
hand
and
coolly
walked
away
she
looked
at
the
penny
lying
in
her
hand
and
then
after
the
boy
who
was
walking
up
the
street
and
she
could
help
thinking
how
very
little
it
was
and
how
she
hoped
he
would
have
given
her
more
she
looked
at
the
little
broom
he
had
ruined
and
everything
seemed
sadder
than
before
then
by
some
strange
freak
her
mind
ran
off
to
the
gardens
where
her
mother
slept
as
it
always
did
when
darkness
gathered
round
her
and
she
longed
more
than
ever
before
to
throw
herself
on
the
ground
there
and
quietly
sleep
a
long
long
time
during
the
whole
day
she
had
received
but
a
few
pennies
so
few
they
would
not
induce
a
doctor
to
go
down
to
her
sick
aunt
if
she
only
could
have
met
some
kind
heart
which
would
have
gone
home
with
her
and
given
kind
words
and
soothing
draughts
to
the
sick
one
but
it
was
not
brought
into
her
path
when
she
came
home
and
saw
how
much
worse
her
aunt
was
than
when
she
had
left
her
in
the
morning
her
little
heart
grew
sick
and
cybele
who
had
seen
her
mother
grow
thin
and
die
began
to
be
terrified
lest
the
aunt
too
would
be
taken
so
she
went
up
to
her
gently
and
kissed
her
brow
and
the
poor
aunt
opened
her
eyes
and
smiled
mournfully
and
when
she
heard
how
little
money
the
tambourine
had
brought
that
day
she
tried
to
conceal
her
sorrow
lest
the
little
child
should
be
grieved
then
cybele
lighted
a
small
fire
in
their
bit
of
a
fireplace
and
made
a
little
tea
for
her
aunt
it
was
the
very
last
she
had
but
when
she
thought
how
much
her
aunt
needed
it
and
how
she
would
need
still
more
on
the
morrow
hope
whispered
quite
cheerfully
that
with
the
tambourine
she
would
win
from
people
pockets
many
a
bright
cent
with
these
thoughts
she
looked
very
lovingly
towards
the
tambourine
which
lay
quietly
upon
the
floor
in
the
corner
its
gay
bells
silent
as
if
it
too
felt
sorrow
for
the
aunt
sickness
after
cybele
had
toasted
a
bit
of
bread
and
given
it
with
the
tea
to
the
aunt
had
received
the
kind
kiss
and
saw
her
close
her
eyes
she
thought
she
slept
and
new
courage
filled
her
heart
she
began
to
think
of
the
pleasant
people
she
should
see
what
a
kind
crowd
she
drew
about
her
they
looked
on
her
with
loving
eyes
and
the
sweet
smiles
played
about
their
lips
there
were
the
groups
of
pretty
children
in
gay
frocks
and
rosy
cheeks
which
should
gather
about
the
when
she
should
stop
before
it
and
strike
the
tambourine
with
her
hand
and
they
would
smile
upon
her
and
then
the
elder
sister
who
should
be
so
mild
and
gentle
would
come
and
throw
up
the
sash
and
speak
with
her
and
perhaps
even
she
would
throw
down
to
her
a
sprig
of
the
geranium
which
stood
near
by
on
the
then
she
was
lured
further
on
to
think
of
a
great
fortune
which
was
to
be
obtained
that
she
might
go
back
to
the
laughing
skies
of
italy
and
spend
her
days
in
the
lovely
garden
where
her
mother
slept
but
when
cybele
arose
in
the
morning
and
told
her
aunt
how
she
was
going
out
to
gather
in
the
pennies
the
poor
aunt
sighed
and
bade
her
stay
at
home
a
while
for
she
could
not
bear
to
be
alone
so
cybele
sat
down
upon
the
floor
and
taking
the
tambourine
sang
and
played
the
softest
and
sweetest
airs
she
could
remember
and
as
she
played
it
seemed
as
though
new
tones
and
words
even
were
given
to
speak
out
of
it
she
astonished
herself
and
a
kind
of
sorrowful
ecstasy
came
into
her
soul
she
played
on
and
on
and
forgot
that
the
day
was
passing
off
in
which
she
was
to
earn
so
many
bright
pennies
in
order
to
bring
home
the
kind
physician
who
was
to
make
the
dear
aunt
well
at
once
she
went
to
the
land
and
sang
of
the
vineyards
and
the
soft
warm
air
of
the
waters
and
the
fragrant
blossoms
around
the
banks
of
the
lakes
o
the
moon
rose
up
before
her
and
she
drank
from
its
loving
beams
the
stars
sent
down
their
misty
light
as
if
shrouded
because
of
their
great
beauty
once
in
that
land
how
had
she
forgotten
all
things
else
a
holy
inspiration
had
come
down
over
her
an
angel
of
light
appeared
to
her
enchanted
eyes
beckoning
her
to
rest
her
head
upon
his
bosom
fear
not
he
said
for
i
will
yet
take
you
to
the
lovely
gardens
where
your
mother
dwells
but
when
she
eagerly
stretched
out
her
arms
and
cried
take
me
now
he
disappeared
and
she
found
the
song
stayed
upon
her
lips
the
room
hushed
and
only
the
glory
which
the
angel
presence
had
shed
about
still
lingered
there
the
holy
stillness
came
into
her
heart
also
and
she
sat
quietly
upon
the
floor
a
long
time
and
when
at
last
she
rose
and
went
up
to
her
aunt
bedside
she
found
the
brow
she
kissed
was
cold
the
hand
she
clasped
was
chilly
and
in
looking
with
fear
upon
the
aunt
face
she
found
the
dews
of
death
resting
there
the
aunt
was
dead
those
songs
which
flowed
so
easily
from
lips
had
become
the
requiem
of
the
dead
and
those
soft
tones
had
been
the
last
sigh
of
a
passing
soul
cybele
knew
that
when
the
angel
had
her
as
she
sang
he
had
borne
hence
her
aunt
spirit
but
o
it
was
so
hard
to
be
left
all
alone
and
when
the
people
from
the
other
room
came
in
and
prepared
her
aunt
for
the
burial
when
they
took
her
from
the
bed
and
put
her
in
the
rude
coffin
the
child
heart
felt
like
breaking
and
had
it
not
been
for
the
words
the
angel
had
spoken
to
her
when
he
came
to
bear
hence
the
dear
aunt
she
would
have
wept
without
ever
smiling
again
then
they
carried
away
the
coffin
into
a
dismal
place
where
was
neither
green
grass
nor
pleasant
brook
nor
even
a
flower
might
it
be
ever
so
little
and
there
was
a
row
of
square
black
doors
against
the
walls
one
of
which
they
opened
and
shoved
the
coffin
into
a
dark
place
o
it
was
so
dreary
a
place
with
the
high
fence
all
about
it
and
the
cold
dismal
gray
clouds
above
it
did
not
seem
to
cybele
that
she
could
leave
the
aunt
there
could
she
only
lie
away
in
the
beautiful
land
where
the
mother
slept
where
the
birds
rested
their
wings
upon
the
and
the
blue
sky
smiled
in
quiet
peacefulness
but
the
people
who
stood
around
could
not
understand
her
grief
and
so
they
hurried
her
from
the
yard
and
locked
up
the
gate
that
night
cybele
lay
alone
upon
the
bed
on
which
her
aunt
had
died
and
the
lonely
grief
came
so
fast
upon
her
that
she
could
not
sleep
and
the
morning
found
her
weary
and
then
there
came
into
her
room
a
coarse
man
who
told
her
she
must
go
out
for
she
could
no
longer
live
there
that
she
might
be
allowed
to
take
her
tambourine
with
her
but
all
the
rest
and
there
was
little
enough
the
two
chairs
the
bed
the
kettle
and
the
few
things
in
the
cupboard
were
his
to
pay
for
the
rent
of
the
room
and
he
told
her
if
she
brought
a
few
pennies
to
the
people
who
lived
in
the
next
room
when
night
was
come
they
would
take
care
of
her
now
the
man
had
no
sooner
spoken
these
words
than
cybele
decided
to
have
nothing
to
do
with
the
people
in
the
next
room
for
she
could
not
love
them
the
father
and
mother
were
so
coarse
and
cross
and
the
boys
were
so
rude
and
big
they
had
often
refused
to
help
her
aunt
and
while
she
was
sick
they
had
never
come
with
kind
words
to
smooth
her
pillow
even
after
she
had
died
they
had
but
come
to
put
her
in
a
rude
coffin
and
carry
her
to
a
dismal
place
from
which
they
thrust
out
the
only
heart
who
yearned
for
her
so
cybele
did
not
think
of
going
to
them
she
tied
the
large
silk
handkerchief
over
her
head
which
had
served
her
for
a
bonnet
since
she
had
left
italy
and
taking
her
dear
tambourine
in
her
hand
and
the
poor
neglected
brooms
she
went
away
out
of
the
rooms
where
she
had
lived
so
long
where
she
had
seen
the
angel
and
where
her
aunt
had
died
then
after
standing
upon
the
sill
of
the
door
a
few
moments
looking
down
the
long
staircase
out
into
the
world
to
which
she
was
going
she
raised
her
gray
eyes
and
sweetly
said
as
though
replying
to
the
angel
admonition
i
not
afraid
ah
dearest
one
you
need
not
fear
when
the
heavenly
father
is
so
near
unto
your
heart
without
more
hesitation
she
said
to
the
room
and
quickly
sped
down
the
staircase
out
into
the
world
while
thus
she
talked
to
her
tambourine
do
you
be
afraid
either
dear
little
tambourine
and
she
held
it
tenderly
in
her
arms
nor
you
dear
brooms
we
shall
have
happy
times
together
yet
only
think
of
the
beautiful
tunes
i
play
on
you
and
how
the
children
will
clap
their
hands
when
they
hear
your
bells
no
do
be
in
the
least
afraid
i
play
on
you
as
i
never
have
before
since
once
here
the
little
lip
quivered
in
spite
of
itself
only
try
and
play
real
pretty
do
so
i
sha
ever
be
lonesome
with
thinking
of
the
lovely
gardens
at
home
ah
tambourine
tambourine
you
and
i
are
all
alone
just
then
a
sweet
tone
came
from
the
bells
of
the
tambourine
and
comforted
cybele
heart
she
wandered
up
the
streets
and
stopped
to
look
in
upon
the
windows
of
the
but
the
and
those
wonderful
witches
who
would
always
stand
on
their
heads
had
no
charm
for
her
longer
her
heart
was
saddened
and
when
she
tried
to
strike
out
gay
tunes
they
would
not
come
only
sad
ones
and
sad
words
from
her
lips
the
children
pitied
her
grave
looks
and
when
they
could
not
persuade
her
to
dance
for
them
they
would
leave
her
in
silence
when
she
looked
about
her
and
saw
all
the
children
how
they
were
never
alone
that
their
eye
danced
and
their
voices
were
mirthful
she
would
ask
herself
why
she
too
was
not
happy
then
courage
would
come
to
her
and
she
would
strike
a
gay
air
and
call
the
children
to
her
side
but
when
she
had
finished
she
was
glad
to
creep
away
by
herself
and
lean
her
head
upon
her
tambourine
to
weep
then
when
the
voice
of
the
angel
sounded
in
her
heart
she
would
raise
her
head
to
reply
meekly
no
i
not
afraid
it
chanced
one
day
that
she
wandered
into
the
obscure
corner
of
a
church
it
was
evening
service
and
at
first
she
was
only
glad
to
get
away
from
the
cold
biting
air
but
she
had
not
been
there
long
before
a
strange
feeling
of
gladness
rose
up
in
her
heart
the
organ
awoke
from
its
stillness
and
the
tones
gladdened
her
as
the
tambourine
dear
as
it
was
had
never
done
the
hazy
light
poured
in
through
the
windows
and
lit
up
the
faces
of
the
scattered
worshippers
with
seraphic
beauty
and
it
gave
golden
edges
to
the
spotless
robe
of
the
priest
in
the
chancel
played
upon
his
white
flowing
hair
and
shone
upon
his
uplifted
countenance
the
priest
spoke
out
blessed
words
of
the
father
in
heaven
how
he
calls
the
tired
and
weary
to
come
and
be
folded
up
in
his
arms
how
he
even
says
suffer
little
children
to
come
unto
mo
and
forbid
them
not
for
of
such
is
the
kingdom
of
heaven
these
words
fell
into
the
parched
heart
of
little
cybele
and
ran
all
along
there
in
low
sobs
and
stretching
up
her
tiny
arms
she
murmured
take
me
take
me
now
i
want
to
come
and
she
began
to
think
of
the
angel
who
had
said
to
her
fear
not
for
i
will
yet
take
you
to
the
lovely
gardens
where
your
mother
dwells
the
organ
ceased
the
priest
went
out
from
the
chancel
one
by
one
the
people
passed
out
from
the
church
the
sexton
closed
up
the
doors
and
went
away
and
cybele
sat
in
her
corner
longing
to
see
again
the
angel
who
was
so
often
in
her
thoughts
until
the
hazy
light
had
faded
away
in
the
darkness
then
the
moon
rose
and
streamed
into
the
church
down
the
long
aisles
and
up
into
the
chancel
and
from
the
window
above
the
place
where
the
priest
had
spoken
those
holy
words
there
flooded
a
glory
of
light
while
the
columns
and
galleries
stood
still
in
their
deepened
shadows
it
was
so
holy
a
calm
as
to
fill
cybele
with
a
joyful
awe
the
tambourine
slid
from
her
lap
she
crossed
her
hands
upon
her
breast
and
bent
forward
her
head
with
closed
eyes
low
notes
of
the
sweetest
music
swelled
on
the
air
louder
they
grew
until
they
seemed
like
the
voices
of
those
rejoicing
for
deliverance
from
great
sorrow
louder
louder
yet
the
voices
of
angels
mingled
with
them
as
cybele
looked
up
there
she
saw
great
bands
of
holy
angels
rejoicing
over
her
among
them
the
very
one
whose
words
of
consolation
had
been
with
her
so
many
days
quickly
to
him
she
stretched
out
her
arms
and
he
reached
low
down
and
raised
her
up
to
him
and
they
soared
up
up
to
the
region
of
the
sun
and
the
moon
hearing
about
them
the
soft
voices
of
loving
angels
the
air
was
loaded
with
the
perfumes
of
celestial
flowers
while
every
angel
they
met
gave
them
a
word
of
welcome
the
angel
did
as
he
had
promised
and
the
heavenly
father
whom
cybele
had
prayed
to
take
her
gave
her
into
the
loving
arms
of
the
mother
who
dwelt
in
lovelier
gardens
than
those
of
fair
italy
even
the
gardens
of
heaven
when
the
people
next
opened
the
church
they
found
a
dead
child
in
one
of
its
corners
a
little
tambourine
lay
by
its
side
which
when
they
picked
it
up
gave
out
pleasant
cheering
tones
but
when
they
laid
the
dead
body
of
the
child
in
a
cold
damp
grave
they
little
thought
what
happy
songs
the
living
spirit
of
it
sang
with
its
mother
in
the
lovely
gardens
of
god
the
story
of
maggie
journey
little
maggie
lived
all
alone
in
a
small
house
which
contained
but
one
room
she
had
lived
alone
ever
since
the
time
her
mother
had
gone
to
the
palace
of
the
great
king
at
first
maggie
had
cried
very
bitterly
to
think
of
living
alone
without
her
mother
so
did
her
mother
too
as
for
that
matter
for
no
mother
ever
loved
her
child
more
dearly
than
she
did
maggie
maggie
she
had
said
to
her
when
she
knew
she
must
go
i
shall
love
you
just
as
tenderly
as
ever
and
always
think
of
you
even
while
i
am
in
the
great
king
palace
it
is
a
long
journey
thither
and
i
expect
i
shall
be
obliged
to
go
through
a
great
many
dark
and
strange
places
before
coming
there
and
i
fear
the
most
of
all
to
leave
you
in
this
little
old
house
all
alone
but
you
know
i
can
not
disobey
the
king
and
so
must
follow
this
servant
whom
he
has
sent
to
bring
me
but
o
maggie
do
follow
me
for
i
shall
be
anxiously
watching
for
you
till
you
come
be
sure
now
and
do
disappoint
me
and
when
you
come
i
think
you
had
better
start
early
in
the
morning
for
the
road
is
a
long
and
dangerous
one
perhaps
this
was
a
long
speech
to
make
but
when
mothers
go
on
such
journeys
as
maggie
mother
was
to
go
on
it
is
not
an
unusual
custom
for
them
to
do
so
and
especially
when
we
remember
how
she
would
leave
maggie
all
alone
it
was
only
to
be
wondered
she
said
no
more
when
her
mother
had
really
gone
the
first
thing
maggie
did
was
to
sit
down
upon
the
and
cry
bitterly
she
could
not
bear
to
think
her
mother
had
really
gone
and
that
if
ever
she
wanted
to
see
her
she
must
start
upon
that
long
long
journey
at
first
i
do
think
she
loved
to
think
about
the
great
king
who
had
taken
her
mother
away
and
she
was
obliged
to
think
over
the
beautiful
things
her
mother
had
said
of
him
many
times
before
she
could
be
glad
he
had
called
her
mother
but
at
last
she
rose
from
the
and
went
into
the
house
she
had
not
much
in
it
is
true
she
had
much
to
put
in
it
and
if
she
had
had
more
the
house
was
so
small
there
would
have
been
no
place
for
anything
but
what
already
was
there
the
principal
thing
in
the
room
was
the
it
was
so
large
as
to
cover
the
whole
of
one
side
of
the
room
there
was
a
broad
stone
hearth
on
which
sometimes
maggie
would
place
a
few
sticks
she
had
picked
up
in
the
streets
and
light
them
but
the
little
fire
they
made
looked
just
as
if
it
were
ashamed
of
itself
for
burning
in
such
a
great
fireplace
and
the
winds
indignant
at
its
presumption
would
rush
down
the
chimney
at
a
more
desperate
rate
than
usual
blowing
the
ashes
into
maggie
eyes
as
she
sat
before
the
little
fire
and
sending
the
smoke
curling
in
funny
forms
about
the
room
so
maggie
would
run
and
cover
herself
in
her
poor
bed
and
say
to
herself
that
it
was
a
comfort
to
have
ashes
and
smoke
for
though
they
did
blow
in
her
eyes
still
they
came
from
the
fire
sometimes
she
would
gather
up
sawdust
and
by
this
fire
she
was
able
to
warm
her
feet
a
little
though
not
much
for
as
fast
as
she
warmed
them
the
winds
blew
down
again
so
they
were
as
cold
as
before
you
see
it
was
a
cold
kind
of
a
place
in
which
maggie
lived
so
cold
that
although
it
was
summer
still
a
good
many
people
hearts
were
frozen
quite
stiff
so
their
friends
despaired
of
their
ever
being
thawed
out
and
their
tongues
too
were
affected
so
they
could
not
speak
gentle
kind
words
i
do
mean
to
say
the
cold
ever
dealt
quite
so
shabbily
by
maggie
or
maggie
mother
which
was
rather
strange
perhaps
since
they
could
have
but
little
fire
and
the
frost
could
walk
very
boldly
in
through
the
cracks
all
about
the
house
still
it
was
almost
as
bad
that
such
things
should
happen
to
their
neighbors
as
every
one
knows
it
is
uncomfortable
to
behold
such
misery
beside
the
and
bed
maggie
had
some
cracked
plates
and
saucers
which
she
arranged
on
the
and
some
bits
of
china
which
she
had
found
in
piles
of
rubbish
and
which
she
thought
very
beautiful
now
the
was
very
high
and
she
managed
to
put
these
things
up
there
by
climbing
up
the
which
was
rather
a
dangerous
thing
for
her
to
do
and
as
it
was
a
very
little
difficult
too
she
did
not
often
take
down
those
things
now
those
cracked
plates
and
saucers
and
bits
of
china
were
all
the
ornaments
maggie
had
for
her
house
and
they
were
very
precious
to
her
she
would
sit
and
look
at
them
what
people
did
who
got
any
and
thinking
how
strange
it
would
seem
there
in
her
house
if
they
were
taken
away
you
see
maggie
knew
how
to
prize
little
things
and
so
some
day
great
ones
may
fall
to
her
i
did
wrong
to
say
she
lived
all
alone
for
she
had
a
beautiful
white
dove
was
it
nice
it
was
very
white
and
nestled
close
in
bosom
when
she
carried
it
out
of
the
house
and
in
the
night
it
lay
close
to
her
heart
o
there
was
nothing
maggie
prized
like
the
dove
for
it
was
given
her
by
her
mother
just
before
she
went
away
and
she
told
her
it
would
guide
her
when
she
began
her
journey
so
it
was
not
strange
maggie
should
love
it
so
well
it
was
a
lovely
sensitive
thing
when
maggie
had
become
thoroughly
weary
and
tired
of
living
all
alone
by
herself
she
told
her
grief
to
the
dove
and
it
would
press
nearer
and
nearer
to
her
heart
and
when
its
mistress
tears
fell
on
its
head
its
moans
were
so
sorrowful
that
maggie
quickly
forgot
her
own
grief
and
strove
to
comfort
it
now
it
was
in
the
summer
time
and
maggie
got
along
pretty
well
for
all
the
cold
winds
which
blew
in
that
region
but
winter
was
coming
on
and
she
feared
it
might
be
more
uncomfortable
for
her
it
happened
one
night
that
she
heard
a
great
noise
and
awoke
in
a
great
fright
the
moon
shone
very
brightly
and
by
its
light
she
saw
a
tall
man
carrying
away
her
door
at
first
she
thought
she
must
be
mistaken
and
that
if
she
waited
a
while
she
would
see
that
he
was
about
to
do
something
very
different
but
no
he
took
first
the
door
well
off
the
hinges
put
the
hinges
in
his
pocket
the
door
on
his
back
and
went
off
then
maggie
jumped
quickly
from
her
bed
and
running
to
the
open
doorway
cried
out
do
take
my
door
i
live
here
but
the
man
certainly
did
not
hear
maggie
at
all
events
he
did
not
once
turn
back
but
went
away
quite
out
of
sight
but
what
could
he
want
with
my
door
said
maggie
in
a
high
state
of
amazement
houses
all
have
doors
so
he
ca
want
it
for
his
house
she
stood
a
long
time
wondering
and
perplexed
and
i
must
acknowledge
if
i
had
been
there
i
should
have
wondered
too
it
was
quite
a
long
time
before
maggie
could
persuade
herself
to
go
to
bed
again
and
sleep
till
morning
which
she
finally
did
feeling
very
thankful
the
man
did
take
the
bed
in
the
morning
a
new
joy
was
in
store
for
her
she
found
that
the
sun
now
when
it
rose
could
look
directly
in
upon
her
and
his
warm
rays
would
give
warmth
to
her
little
room
as
she
looked
up
to
the
on
which
her
bits
of
broken
china
were
glowing
from
the
sunshine
she
jumped
out
of
bed
in
an
ecstasy
of
delight
o
dear
dear
she
cried
what
if
that
man
had
taken
away
those
how
i
should
have
cried
but
now
he
has
by
taking
the
door
given
the
sun
a
chance
to
make
them
look
more
beautiful
now
she
began
to
love
the
sun
better
than
ever
for
he
had
become
one
of
the
things
which
beautified
her
little
home
and
she
always
woke
early
so
as
to
meet
his
first
look
when
he
came
into
the
room
still
it
must
be
confessed
that
the
absence
of
her
door
did
at
times
make
her
poor
home
more
desolate
when
for
instance
the
winds
went
mad
and
the
rain
came
down
in
torrents
from
the
clouds
o
such
a
frolicking
as
there
was
down
her
large
chimney
and
out
through
the
doorway
then
round
and
round
the
house
they
would
run
chasing
each
other
now
bursting
into
a
boisterous
mirth
now
howling
in
low
dull
tones
until
in
again
at
the
door
they
swept
and
up
through
the
chimney
in
maggie
mind
the
chimney
and
open
doorway
belonged
especially
to
the
winds
she
always
thought
of
them
in
connection
and
when
they
began
their
frolicking
she
would
seat
herself
in
one
corner
and
listen
sometimes
it
seemed
as
though
the
winds
rushed
at
one
another
one
coming
down
the
chimney
and
the
other
in
at
the
door
then
when
they
met
there
was
a
kind
of
explosion
a
thick
quick
quarrel
and
then
they
would
draw
off
in
merry
laughter
then
would
maggie
clap
her
hands
with
glee
thinking
it
fine
sport
but
when
a
whole
blast
burst
at
once
upon
the
house
and
seemed
desperately
to
struggle
through
every
crevice
she
would
crouch
with
fear
and
upbraid
the
winds
with
their
sudden
freaks
there
was
one
mystery
which
maggie
found
herself
unable
to
unravel
it
was
this
she
felt
perfectly
certain
the
chimney
was
made
for
the
winds
to
come
down
through
and
still
she
knew
it
was
intended
for
her
to
make
a
smoky
kind
of
fire
once
in
a
while
on
its
hearth
with
which
the
winds
quarrelled
and
destroyed
it
here
were
two
things
irreconcilable
often
would
she
stand
on
the
hearth
and
look
up
the
black
throat
of
the
chimney
wondering
how
this
inconsistency
happened
wishing
again
and
again
that
the
winds
would
like
the
fire
and
let
it
burn
well
but
she
never
thought
of
asking
them
to
desist
she
looked
upon
their
freaks
as
privileged
to
the
dear
dove
did
maggie
always
turn
for
comfort
and
relief
its
love
was
a
guarantee
of
her
mother
and
as
often
as
she
looked
upon
and
held
it
to
her
heart
so
often
did
she
feel
sure
that
one
day
she
would
feel
the
pressure
of
her
mother
hand
upon
her
head
once
when
maggie
was
talking
to
the
dove
and
thinking
of
her
mother
it
came
into
her
head
to
begin
that
journey
to
the
great
king
palace
why
not
said
she
why
do
i
live
here
the
cold
winter
is
coming
and
my
door
is
gone
and
the
sun
already
gives
me
warning
that
he
shall
not
look
in
at
the
door
as
usual
the
neighbors
will
be
colder
than
ever
and
some
of
them
will
quite
freeze
i
a
mind
to
go
away
what
do
you
think
dovey
the
dove
nestled
close
to
her
heart
and
cooed
joyfully
would
you
like
it
well
i
do
know
but
i
had
better
start
but
i
should
have
to
leave
the
house
and
that
would
be
rather
bad
and
the
chimney
where
the
winds
play
i
think
it
would
seem
lonesome
for
them
and
i
do
know
as
they
would
like
it
for
there
would
be
no
one
to
listen
to
them
still
i
do
want
to
go
and
i
think
i
better
i
sure
said
maggie
after
some
pause
during
which
she
lovingly
caressed
the
dove
head
i
sure
i
do
see
why
i
did
go
before
i
do
know
why
i
should
have
lived
here
so
long
alone
i
can
take
some
of
the
best
china
and
leave
all
the
rest
perhaps
some
little
child
may
like
to
live
here
after
i
am
gone
and
watch
the
winds
as
i
have
done
but
i
do
hope
they
wo
frighten
her
at
first
or
she
will
want
to
go
away
maggie
was
an
expeditious
child
and
when
she
had
decided
to
do
something
she
went
at
once
about
accomplishing
it
so
she
left
the
on
which
she
had
been
sitting
and
went
in
the
house
to
see
what
she
wanted
to
take
and
as
she
had
so
few
things
the
preparations
were
not
long
but
she
soon
found
herself
with
her
blanket
pinned
over
her
head
ready
to
start
is
true
a
few
tears
came
into
her
eyes
as
she
bid
farewell
to
the
bed
which
had
been
her
shelter
against
every
unpleasant
sight
and
sound
but
when
she
turned
to
the
chimney
and
some
perplexing
thought
of
the
quarrels
of
the
wind
and
the
fire
came
over
her
she
rather
rejoiced
she
would
soon
be
away
from
it
where
this
one
mystery
of
their
disagreement
should
never
again
trouble
her
laying
the
white
dove
in
her
bosom
she
turned
from
the
house
and
so
beheld
herself
fairly
launched
on
her
journey
a
little
while
she
found
it
pleasant
the
road
was
straight
and
lined
with
flowers
the
dove
raised
his
head
and
looked
in
maggie
eyes
with
delight
but
soon
she
came
to
a
place
where
two
roads
met
forming
the
one
she
had
been
travelling
here
was
a
perplexity
which
should
she
take
which
would
lead
her
where
she
wanted
to
go
there
was
a
house
close
by
so
she
stepped
up
to
the
door
of
it
and
knocked
a
lady
who
was
very
pretty
to
look
at
and
who
wore
a
very
rich
dress
opened
the
door
but
just
at
the
moment
when
maggie
asked
will
you
tell
me
which
road
leads
to
the
palace
of
the
great
king
that
same
terrible
cold
wind
came
round
and
blew
directly
into
the
lady
mouth
so
that
she
replied
i
know
nothing
about
it
and
very
much
doubt
if
there
be
any
great
king
at
all
and
then
she
shut
the
door
in
great
haste
leaving
poor
maggie
in
much
distress
and
doubt
she
was
astonished
at
the
woman
words
and
wondered
why
she
shut
the
door
so
soon
for
if
she
had
not
she
would
have
told
her
about
the
king
how
she
was
sure
he
was
alive
and
had
a
great
palace
and
too
she
could
have
told
her
his
servant
had
come
once
and
taken
her
mother
with
him
and
she
could
never
forget
him
he
had
been
dressed
in
black
but
on
his
head
he
wore
a
crown
of
the
most
glorious
stars
and
their
brightness
had
filled
the
little
house
with
holy
light
so
that
even
after
he
had
departed
it
still
lingered
around
she
thought
some
of
knocking
again
and
telling
the
poor
lady
for
she
thought
it
was
sad
enough
not
to
know
about
the
great
king
but
though
she
knocked
a
long
time
no
one
came
to
the
door
and
finally
she
was
obliged
to
leave
the
steps
of
the
house
and
gather
some
directions
one
of
the
roads
seemed
cold
and
looked
narrow
and
maggie
who
had
suffered
so
much
from
the
cold
turned
from
it
with
a
shudder
towards
the
other
which
looked
much
gayer
and
many
more
people
walked
in
it
but
the
dove
looked
anxiously
towards
the
narrow
one
which
grieved
maggie
and
made
her
cry
out
o
dovey
dovey
how
can
you
love
the
cold
so
well
or
ask
me
to
go
where
it
is
let
us
rather
walk
this
way
a
little
and
do
you
not
see
there
are
plenty
of
so
if
we
wish
we
can
go
on
to
that
narrow
road
at
any
time
so
notwithstanding
the
dove
remonstrances
maggie
entered
this
road
and
found
the
air
so
pleasant
and
warm
that
she
liked
nothing
better
than
to
walk
in
it
she
saw
a
great
many
people
here
but
they
took
no
notice
of
the
little
girl
who
walked
along
so
quietly
with
her
dove
in
her
bosom
and
the
bits
of
china
in
her
pocket
but
if
they
did
not
notice
her
she
noticed
them
well
and
thought
them
strange
enough
to
her
surprise
she
found
the
air
which
had
at
first
seemed
so
warm
began
to
grow
cold
and
more
like
the
air
about
the
old
house
and
shivering
with
cold
and
seeing
the
people
about
her
wearing
large
cloaks
it
was
quite
natural
she
should
ask
them
to
let
her
in
beneath
the
warm
folds
of
them
to
her
civil
request
some
of
them
paid
no
attention
others
looked
at
her
in
wonder
and
some
were
so
rude
as
to
speak
cruel
words
to
her
and
bid
her
not
dare
speak
to
them
again
so
maggie
saw
them
walk
on
wrapped
in
their
warm
cloaks
and
complained
not
indeed
she
had
lived
too
long
in
the
little
house
without
a
door
not
to
be
able
to
bear
the
cold
bravely
only
she
could
not
help
wishing
sometimes
that
she
had
the
bed
with
her
that
she
might
jump
in
between
its
clothes
and
warm
herself
a
while
but
she
was
patient
remembering
that
she
was
journeying
towards
the
great
king
palace
where
her
mother
lived
suddenly
it
occurred
to
her
that
the
road
to
the
great
king
palace
lay
through
a
remarkably
cold
country
and
that
the
people
who
were
travelling
thither
seemed
in
no
haste
for
they
often
sat
down
by
the
and
played
and
some
even
went
back
instead
of
forward
while
all
those
little
which
she
thought
she
had
seen
before
had
vanished
so
one
day
she
said
to
one
of
the
people
who
sat
down
why
do
you
not
hasten
that
you
may
see
the
great
king
the
great
king
indeed
he
said
whom
she
had
addressed
i
am
in
no
hurry
to
see
him
and
others
intimated
as
much
as
the
lady
long
ago
had
said
that
they
themselves
doubted
very
much
if
there
were
any
great
king
at
all
what
shall
i
do
cried
maggie
i
can
not
be
in
the
right
way
o
how
shall
i
get
to
the
great
king
palace
and
upon
this
the
dove
rose
up
from
maggie
bosom
and
turned
backwards
whither
they
had
come
though
long
and
dreary
seemed
the
cold
road
she
must
retrace
yet
such
was
her
confidence
in
the
dove
she
turned
very
gladly
and
though
not
one
of
those
people
had
cared
for
maggie
before
now
they
clustered
around
her
begging
her
not
to
leave
them
and
seeking
to
draw
her
away
from
her
purpose
and
when
she
saw
how
they
seemed
to
love
her
and
feel
sorrow
at
her
going
she
said
to
them
i
am
grieved
to
leave
you
since
you
have
just
begun
to
love
me
but
i
promised
my
mother
i
would
go
to
the
great
king
palace
and
i
must
go
where
dovey
leads
me
how
silly
to
mind
a
bird
cried
one
and
picking
up
a
stone
he
hurled
it
at
the
dove
who
was
hovering
in
the
air
and
broke
its
wing
so
it
could
not
fly
then
indeed
it
seemed
as
though
her
grief
was
very
great
and
she
could
not
help
wishing
she
were
already
in
the
great
king
palace
or
that
he
would
send
his
servant
for
her
who
was
dressed
in
the
black
robe
and
wore
the
crown
of
stars
she
often
saw
this
servant
now
he
came
to
bear
many
away
but
the
crown
of
stars
was
not
on
his
brow
and
his
face
shed
no
light
around
only
gloom
well
maggie
was
obliged
to
stop
and
bind
up
the
dove
wing
and
tend
it
a
little
before
she
could
proceed
on
her
journey
all
delay
was
unwelcome
to
her
for
as
the
journeying
thus
far
had
been
in
pain
the
true
journey
was
still
to
begin
she
was
so
hungry
and
thirsty
too
so
it
seemed
impossible
she
could
proceed
when
once
she
had
started
forward
there
was
no
one
to
give
her
a
crust
of
bread
or
offer
her
a
cup
of
cold
water
nevertheless
she
would
tell
the
poor
dove
who
was
moaning
with
pain
for
she
thought
and
well
enough
that
he
had
as
much
of
his
own
trouble
as
he
could
well
endure
she
had
another
trouble
too
there
were
some
people
whom
she
could
not
think
desired
to
go
away
from
the
king
palace
and
so
she
would
tell
them
how
they
were
going
altogether
in
the
wrong
path
but
they
would
either
laugh
or
stare
at
her
in
wonder
then
she
would
almost
have
stood
weeping
in
the
road
at
their
strange
conduct
but
the
dove
would
incessantly
warn
her
to
go
on
at
last
between
grief
and
hunger
she
fell
sick
and
thought
she
should
die
there
without
ever
seeing
her
mother
or
the
great
king
but
lo
a
gentle
being
clothed
in
a
white
spotless
garment
came
and
put
to
her
lips
a
cup
of
medicine
which
she
told
maggie
if
she
would
but
drink
would
make
her
quite
well
again
and
protect
her
against
hunger
and
thirst
for
the
rest
of
the
journey
upon
this
maggie
drank
it
all
but
the
dregs
and
she
found
it
so
bitter
that
she
thought
it
far
worse
than
any
cold
she
had
ever
endured
but
when
the
bright
being
saw
she
left
the
dregs
in
her
cup
she
was
not
satisfied
and
bade
her
drink
those
even
with
tears
in
her
eyes
maggie
drank
them
as
she
bade
her
and
then
the
bright
one
vanished
leaving
the
child
quite
well
and
vigorous
the
weariness
vanished
from
her
frame
the
parching
thirst
from
her
mouth
and
what
was
yet
more
amazing
she
found
the
little
dove
quite
well
and
she
stood
with
it
in
her
arms
before
the
two
roads
again
so
she
commenced
her
journey
upon
the
road
she
had
so
long
ago
rejected
and
soon
found
that
the
snow
vanished
from
the
ground
and
shook
itself
from
the
the
grass
sprang
up
the
flowers
played
beneath
her
footsteps
and
gay
birds
hopped
among
the
boughs
of
the
trees
making
the
air
melodious
with
their
songs
the
brooklets
ran
murmuring
by
the
and
maggie
dove
cooed
with
joy
o
maggie
knew
this
was
the
road
leading
to
the
palace
of
the
great
king
the
very
one
her
mother
had
travelled
the
road
too
which
she
had
been
told
did
not
exist
she
met
many
children
here
who
sought
the
same
she
did
and
they
talked
with
maggie
and
she
loved
them
and
with
them
thanked
the
king
who
had
made
for
them
such
a
lovely
road
to
his
palace
at
last
one
day
there
came
the
same
servant
who
had
carried
away
her
brother
and
gently
softly
took
her
in
his
arms
so
often
had
she
thought
of
his
coming
that
she
felt
no
kind
of
fear
he
told
her
that
the
great
king
wanted
her
and
that
her
mother
was
all
ready
to
receive
her
o
how
her
heart
leaped
at
this
to
hear
a
real
word
from
her
mother
and
to
think
the
great
king
wanted
her
as
she
lay
in
his
arms
the
servant
who
wore
on
his
head
his
bright
stars
kissed
her
eyes
and
her
brow
he
carried
her
a
long
distance
sped
through
many
a
long
dark
valley
and
then
they
came
out
upon
a
bright
shore
where
were
many
people
dressed
in
shining
clothes
maggie
looked
at
herself
and
saw
with
amazement
that
she
too
was
dressed
likewise
and
that
the
servant
who
had
brought
her
hither
had
no
longer
a
black
robe
but
a
silver
one
which
sparkled
so
maggie
was
scarce
able
to
look
upon
it
she
had
soon
crossed
the
sea
and
then
her
mother
caught
her
in
her
arms
and
wept
for
joy
o
maggie
maggie
she
said
i
have
watched
your
journey
all
along
and
my
sorrow
was
so
deep
when
i
saw
you
mistake
the
roads
it
was
i
whom
the
great
king
sent
when
you
was
sick
that
i
might
bear
his
love
to
you
and
make
you
well
come
now
and
go
with
me
before
his
throne
upon
this
they
joined
the
crowd
who
were
entering
the
palace
but
we
can
not
enter
it
we
must
first
finish
our
journey
the
old
woman
and
the
enchanted
song
ruth
had
two
sisters
grace
and
jessie
now
grace
and
jessie
were
twins
and
everybody
praised
their
blue
eyes
and
rosy
cheeks
and
when
they
laughed
people
said
how
sweetly
they
smile
and
when
they
wept
people
said
poor
little
ones
and
immediately
took
them
in
their
arms
and
strove
to
bring
back
the
dimpling
smile
to
their
faces
grace
and
jessie
played
together
always
and
little
ruth
who
was
younger
than
either
of
them
was
left
often
alone
no
one
ever
called
her
beautiful
nor
stroked
her
hair
nor
kissed
her
brow
and
when
she
stood
by
the
side
of
the
twin
sisters
at
the
gate
and
the
people
in
passing
praised
the
flaxen
curls
of
grace
and
jessie
then
they
would
turn
towards
her
and
their
smiles
vanishing
they
would
regard
her
with
a
pitiful
air
turning
silently
away
then
she
would
creep
off
by
herself
into
some
favorite
nook
of
the
garden
thoroughly
ashamed
that
she
should
so
far
have
forgotten
herself
as
to
stand
by
the
side
of
her
beautiful
sisters
her
mother
too
often
took
her
in
her
lap
and
kissing
her
brow
sorrowfully
would
exclaim
in
sad
tones
my
poor
plain
child
my
dear
homely
ruth
her
father
never
caressed
her
his
love
seemed
to
be
kept
for
the
twins
whose
two
bright
faces
peered
over
his
chair
and
whose
glad
voices
were
always
ready
to
greet
him
on
his
return
home
and
still
ruth
loved
her
father
so
much
and
nestling
close
in
the
corner
of
the
garden
away
off
by
herself
mourned
that
he
never
kissed
her
nor
called
her
his
dear
pretty
ruth
o
thought
the
child
how
i
do
wish
i
could
do
something
for
my
father
which
might
please
him
so
that
only
once
he
might
call
me
his
dear
child
o
why
was
not
i
made
a
twin
thus
the
poor
child
mourned
to
herself
she
had
a
doll
which
she
made
her
constant
companion
and
she
played
it
was
very
lovely
like
grace
and
jessie
she
told
it
all
her
griefs
and
really
came
to
feel
that
the
doll
understood
all
she
said
to
it
she
had
also
another
pleasure
it
was
that
of
reading
her
mother
had
given
her
many
books
and
she
loved
to
sit
among
the
and
read
their
beautiful
stories
she
liked
to
read
about
a
man
who
lived
off
alone
upon
an
island
and
had
only
some
cats
and
monkeys
for
his
companions
how
the
cave
was
his
house
and
the
skins
of
beasts
were
his
garments
how
he
looked
off
upon
the
ocean
and
saw
not
one
sail
and
wandered
about
upon
his
island
without
hearing
one
human
sound
this
story
had
a
wild
fascination
for
our
little
ruth
so
that
she
read
it
again
and
again
yet
still
the
book
was
as
new
to
her
in
its
interest
as
at
first
then
there
were
other
stories
she
loved
to
read
some
about
lonely
patient
lovely
young
girls
who
went
out
into
the
world
alone
to
seek
their
fortunes
and
returned
home
with
wealth
and
honor
she
often
wished
she
might
go
forth
in
this
way
so
that
when
she
came
back
no
one
should
dare
call
her
plain
or
unlovable
then
she
longed
to
hold
some
secret
charm
so
that
whoever
she
should
desire
to
do
so
should
love
and
caress
her
but
still
no
bright
fairy
stooped
down
from
the
skies
to
change
her
black
stiff
hair
into
shining
ringlets
or
her
skin
into
the
fairness
of
that
of
her
sisters
and
so
ruth
only
read
and
wondered
and
wished
one
day
when
as
usual
ruth
had
found
herself
quite
alone
grace
and
jessie
had
gone
to
take
a
walk
and
her
mother
was
reading
by
herself
she
had
taken
her
book
and
sat
down
beneath
the
shade
of
a
broad
tree
in
the
garden
she
was
reading
the
story
of
a
fair
princess
who
had
many
suitors
and
splendid
gifts
and
who
was
called
the
queen
of
beauty
alas
she
cried
why
was
not
i
beautiful
so
i
might
be
loved
then
i
should
not
be
the
sober
odd
thing
i
am
now
would
you
then
so
much
like
to
be
beautiful
dear
child
said
a
voice
close
at
her
side
and
when
ruth
looked
up
she
saw
an
old
woman
whom
she
never
had
seen
before
she
was
clothed
in
a
long
blue
dress
and
her
face
was
full
of
motherly
love
ruth
heart
was
filled
with
gladness
for
seldom
had
so
affectionate
a
glance
been
shed
on
her
and
when
the
old
woman
bent
down
and
kissed
her
how
all
remembrance
of
the
indifference
of
father
mother
friends
vanished
from
her
mind
and
it
seemed
that
her
whole
life
was
given
to
her
new
friend
that
she
might
do
with
her
whatever
she
willed
all
strangeness
at
her
sudden
appearance
vanished
too
as
soon
as
she
had
kissed
her
ruth
felt
under
the
control
of
a
great
power
and
watched
her
movements
with
as
much
love
as
confidence
when
the
old
woman
had
looked
into
ruth
eyes
and
had
seen
the
thoughts
which
beamed
there
she
looked
up
into
the
sky
and
beckoned
to
a
very
light
beautiful
cloud
which
was
sailing
carelessly
along
she
had
no
sooner
done
this
than
the
cloud
began
to
descend
slowly
towards
them
just
as
though
it
understood
her
summons
and
when
it
had
reached
the
place
where
she
stood
it
remained
motionless
illustration
the
old
woman
and
the
enchanted
song
then
she
took
up
little
ruth
in
her
arms
and
stepped
on
to
the
cloud
and
sat
down
and
after
arranging
herself
and
ruth
quite
comfortably
she
said
something
which
ruth
could
not
understand
and
then
the
cloud
began
to
rise
moving
as
easily
as
it
had
done
before
it
came
down
from
the
sky
while
they
were
going
up
ruth
was
amazed
to
see
how
the
garden
and
the
beloved
tree
below
became
continually
smaller
and
smaller
how
she
could
only
distinguish
the
house
and
how
that
became
dimmer
and
dimmer
until
it
entirely
disappeared
from
her
sight
then
she
turned
towards
the
old
woman
and
saw
that
her
kind
blue
eyes
lovingly
regarded
her
and
so
she
still
more
forgot
the
home
below
where
without
doubt
her
departure
would
pass
unnoticed
new
objects
began
to
attract
her
attention
the
cloud
on
which
they
sat
did
not
like
the
others
just
float
over
the
earth
but
it
went
proudly
on
and
came
among
the
stars
and
constellations
of
stars
and
she
saw
how
many
were
clustered
together
and
no
tongue
could
describe
their
beauty
and
then
the
deep
blue
was
ever
about
her
and
she
saw
it
away
off
in
the
distance
growing
to
a
darker
and
darker
shade
until
it
became
like
the
air
of
midnight
while
ever
from
its
darkness
shone
out
those
immense
stars
and
clusters
of
stars
then
the
most
beautiful
sight
of
all
was
when
some
star
glided
past
her
and
shot
afar
off
into
the
dark
blue
beyond
there
was
such
dazzling
glory
in
it
sometimes
they
would
be
quite
near
enough
to
the
stars
they
passed
to
discern
the
people
who
dwelt
upon
them
and
she
felt
for
them
a
friendship
at
once
and
only
longed
that
she
might
go
down
and
tell
them
so
the
child
had
forgotten
she
was
plain
and
odd
she
did
not
think
to
ask
herself
whether
the
people
on
those
bright
stars
so
beautiful
and
happy
might
not
repulse
her
for
her
homeliness
at
last
they
did
approach
one
bright
star
and
ruth
saw
to
her
delight
that
when
the
cloud
had
come
down
into
a
lovely
garden
the
old
woman
stepped
off
from
it
then
took
her
up
also
and
placed
her
on
the
ground
then
the
cloud
which
had
been
their
chariot
and
a
far
better
one
it
was
than
ever
king
had
to
be
drawn
in
rose
upward
and
began
its
gentle
course
in
the
sky
when
the
old
woman
saw
how
ruth
looked
after
it
she
said
to
her
i
use
all
the
clouds
in
that
way
more
or
less
and
all
those
about
your
earth
do
many
such
a
service
while
the
people
little
dream
of
it
in
fact
every
one
there
looks
down
upon
the
ground
too
much
they
have
no
idea
of
the
goodly
things
they
would
find
if
they
searched
upwards
more
the
old
woman
sighed
as
she
said
this
such
a
happy
and
pleasant
looking
old
woman
to
have
sighed
so
deeply
then
she
took
ruth
hand
and
led
her
towards
her
cottage
which
was
the
most
beautiful
thing
you
ever
could
imagine
without
it
had
the
tints
of
the
while
its
framework
was
of
silver
the
windows
and
doors
were
of
diamonds
and
there
sparkled
from
them
continually
all
the
rich
tints
of
the
rainbow
within
everything
was
wrought
of
the
finest
silver
and
the
rooms
were
hung
some
in
delicate
blue
silk
others
in
rose
colors
ruth
was
entirely
overwhelmed
with
the
beauty
of
the
house
so
much
so
as
to
stand
still
looking
at
the
things
about
her
you
must
be
tired
with
your
long
ride
the
woman
said
and
i
wish
you
to
rest
well
for
there
are
many
things
i
will
show
you
after
you
have
rested
i
will
bring
you
some
food
and
with
this
she
put
ruth
upon
a
sofa
and
made
her
lay
quite
down
to
refresh
herself
with
sleep
but
ruth
thought
in
her
heart
rest
does
she
think
i
can
be
tired
when
i
have
been
sitting
upon
that
soft
cloud
looking
at
the
wonderful
stars
how
could
i
ever
be
either
tired
or
hungry
but
she
said
nothing
aloud
for
the
charm
of
the
old
presence
hovered
over
her
and
as
soon
as
she
closed
her
eyes
she
fell
into
a
soft
and
beautiful
slumber
o
the
dreams
ruth
dreamed
then
strangely
enough
she
thought
her
father
and
mother
as
well
as
grace
and
jessie
were
riding
and
playing
on
clouds
and
they
were
all
so
happy
together
and
they
seemed
to
love
her
very
dearly
so
that
in
her
dream
she
remembered
nothing
of
their
former
neglect
she
dreamed
how
her
father
called
her
to
him
and
laid
his
hand
upon
her
head
and
it
was
a
gentle
pressure
and
it
made
her
so
happy
that
she
awoke
and
there
really
was
a
gentle
hand
upon
her
head
and
a
soft
kiss
fell
upon
her
lips
such
a
touch
and
such
a
kiss
as
poor
ruth
had
scarce
ever
known
before
and
which
made
her
quickly
twine
her
arms
around
the
old
woman
neck
and
kiss
her
warmly
then
the
old
woman
put
her
in
one
of
the
chairs
and
put
before
her
on
plates
sparkling
with
precious
stones
soft
ripe
fruit
with
a
delicious
flavor
such
as
she
had
never
before
tasted
she
could
not
help
thinking
how
glad
grace
and
jessie
would
be
to
see
such
before
them
and
so
as
at
that
moment
she
looked
up
and
saw
the
old
woman
smiling
upon
her
she
took
two
of
the
most
beautiful
and
the
largest
of
the
fruit
and
put
them
in
her
pocket
for
she
had
no
doubt
but
what
at
some
time
all
too
soon
she
should
go
back
to
the
earth
when
she
had
done
this
and
finished
her
delicious
repast
which
however
was
slowly
for
she
was
so
filled
with
delight
the
old
woman
bade
her
leave
her
chair
and
come
to
her
upon
which
she
took
her
in
her
arms
and
looking
lovingly
down
upon
her
said
my
dear
ruth
i
am
going
to
show
you
all
the
treasures
which
the
children
upon
the
earth
gather
together
in
order
some
time
to
take
with
them
to
heaven
i
call
their
treasures
what
they
love
most
in
their
hearts
and
put
into
actions
everything
they
do
or
say
is
kept
very
carefully
for
one
day
they
will
want
them
so
you
see
they
can
not
lose
anything
everything
in
nature
every
cloud
that
seems
only
leisurely
floating
in
the
sky
is
serving
some
purpose
and
all
that
is
done
below
is
borne
up
here
ruth
could
not
help
thinking
that
the
old
woman
might
show
her
some
very
beautiful
and
some
very
curious
things
to
keep
and
in
sorrow
she
began
to
think
what
unpleasant
things
of
her
own
were
treasured
up
to
be
given
back
to
her
some
day
when
she
least
expected
or
desired
them
but
the
old
woman
said
nothing
about
ruth
things
but
taking
her
hand
led
her
forth
into
the
garden
again
i
am
going
to
show
you
some
things
there
are
here
said
her
friend
and
if
they
seem
ridiculous
to
you
do
laugh
at
them
for
my
part
i
think
it
sad
children
will
treasure
up
such
miserable
things
they
had
soon
passed
into
the
garden
where
ruth
saw
the
most
delicate
flowers
she
had
ever
seen
they
were
so
tall
and
nodded
their
heads
gayly
to
each
other
but
when
she
came
to
a
bed
of
violets
white
ones
and
blue
larger
than
she
thought
it
was
possible
for
them
to
grow
she
stopped
to
gaze
upon
them
in
complete
admiration
the
fragrance
too
was
delicious
more
so
than
those
her
brother
had
although
those
were
very
fine
ones
take
some
my
child
said
the
old
woman
who
watched
her
delight
with
a
kind
smile
so
down
upon
her
knees
she
dropped
and
took
them
and
she
could
not
help
thinking
how
beautiful
and
lovely
a
smile
would
fall
upon
her
from
her
mother
face
as
she
gave
them
to
her
so
the
violets
too
were
carefully
laid
in
her
pocket
for
her
mother
then
they
passed
out
from
the
garden
and
came
to
a
gray
house
withered
flowers
lay
about
it
while
briers
and
clung
to
its
walls
but
worse
than
all
this
there
came
forth
from
the
house
angry
hateful
words
and
noises
of
a
mad
strife
ruth
feared
to
pass
this
place
and
clung
closely
to
the
old
woman
side
here
said
the
old
woman
kindly
putting
her
arm
around
ruth
are
kept
all
those
angry
words
which
children
speak
to
each
other
and
their
friends
all
their
little
fretful
words
when
they
are
impatient
and
which
they
will
never
wish
to
see
again
but
which
alas
will
be
given
back
to
them
at
a
most
unwelcome
time
then
they
went
on
to
another
house
the
walls
of
which
were
black
and
not
a
green
thing
grew
about
it
there
said
the
old
woman
are
the
treasures
of
those
children
who
care
most
for
themselves
and
do
not
think
of
others
pleasures
those
things
which
they
have
so
loved
are
kept
carefully
for
them
but
they
will
only
tell
them
of
what
they
have
done
for
themselves
so
she
opened
the
door
and
ruth
looked
in
there
was
such
a
medley
of
things
candies
of
gay
colors
nice
waxen
dolls
a
great
many
broken
toys
nice
fruit
and
indeed
i
could
not
begin
to
tell
you
of
all
ruth
saw
there
there
had
come
too
a
mould
upon
many
of
the
things
so
many
of
them
had
grown
tarnished
and
a
bad
stench
rose
from
some
fruit
which
had
been
there
a
long
time
you
see
my
child
said
the
old
woman
as
she
locked
up
the
door
these
things
can
not
be
preserved
to
look
so
brightly
as
when
they
were
first
brought
here
they
all
grow
rotten
and
i
can
not
prevent
the
worms
creeping
in
to
corrupt
them
then
they
met
some
very
clouds
loaded
with
things
like
those
ruth
had
seen
in
the
two
houses
and
they
were
put
in
with
the
rest
alas
she
sighed
that
the
children
will
send
up
these
things
ruth
rejoiced
to
see
that
with
quick
step
her
kind
guide
passed
by
many
more
such
houses
for
they
terrified
her
she
feared
she
might
hear
if
she
listened
well
some
complaint
she
had
uttered
or
should
see
some
tarnished
toy
which
she
had
selfishly
treasured
no
wonder
she
liked
to
hasten
by
the
houses
then
they
passed
away
from
the
dreary
desert
places
where
black
houses
were
into
beautiful
plains
where
the
grass
was
mingled
with
bright
and
lovely
flowers
and
rivulets
gracefully
flowed
along
and
here
were
lovely
temples
shining
with
precious
stones
so
that
ruth
clapped
her
hands
at
beholding
them
here
said
the
old
woman
are
more
beautiful
treasures
which
are
my
great
glory
and
delight
she
showed
ruth
one
round
which
the
whitest
blossoms
grew
among
green
leaves
in
which
were
treasured
all
the
smiles
ever
given
to
comfort
people
who
had
grief
in
their
heart
and
these
smiles
shed
about
the
whole
temple
a
light
like
a
halo
of
glory
in
another
were
the
soft
loving
words
which
many
children
had
given
others
poorer
and
lowlier
than
themselves
to
encourage
their
weak
hearts
words
which
they
had
given
and
forgotten
but
which
had
yet
been
carefully
gathered
up
and
put
in
this
temple
from
this
temple
a
low
sound
of
sweet
music
rose
which
filled
ruth
heart
with
a
perfect
peace
as
if
she
had
found
everything
she
could
ever
desire
in
another
temple
yet
were
all
the
words
of
love
which
children
express
and
feel
in
their
hearts
to
each
other
from
this
temple
proceeded
louder
tones
but
yet
those
of
sweetest
harmony
in
another
all
the
gentle
loving
words
ever
whispered
to
the
animals
i
prize
these
highly
said
the
old
woman
it
is
very
strange
said
she
looking
upon
the
temples
that
i
find
these
precious
treasures
thrown
about
very
carelessly
upon
the
earth
the
children
never
dream
of
their
worth
and
were
i
not
always
ready
there
some
would
be
lost
but
remember
ruth
none
are
suffered
to
be
lost
and
so
when
the
children
to
whom
these
belong
are
going
into
heaven
they
shall
find
there
many
a
treasure
they
did
not
dream
of
possessing
thus
shall
the
treasures
they
had
forgotten
grow
brighter
and
brighter
while
others
they
had
perhaps
remembered
have
grown
corrupted
and
vain
at
these
words
ruth
longed
to
lay
many
treasures
in
the
temples
and
she
heard
a
song
which
the
different
tones
of
the
temple
formed
in
the
air
it
melted
her
heart
with
its
divine
harmony
o
cried
ruth
could
i
but
sing
such
a
song
to
my
father
he
who
loves
songs
so
well
what
joy
it
would
be
to
him
and
would
you
patiently
sing
the
song
though
he
thanked
you
not
asked
the
old
woman
i
desire
him
only
to
hear
it
replied
ruth
and
at
that
moment
the
power
came
to
her
and
such
a
song
poured
from
her
throat
she
was
so
enchanted
but
when
glancing
in
the
brook
she
saw
her
own
figure
so
lit
up
with
beauty
as
scarcely
to
be
able
to
recognize
it
the
old
woman
saw
her
amazement
and
replied
to
it
i
will
send
you
back
to
your
home
that
you
may
sing
this
song
to
your
father
and
remember
little
ruth
that
beauty
only
is
worthy
to
have
which
proceeds
from
the
sweetness
of
thy
words
and
the
loveliness
of
thy
smile
in
heaven
thou
mayst
be
as
lovely
as
thou
wilt
send
up
then
fit
treasures
for
the
temple
and
they
will
be
kept
safely
until
thou
needest
them
then
as
the
tones
of
the
old
woman
voice
died
away
ruth
found
herself
in
the
garden
again
near
her
mother
house
and
had
it
not
been
for
the
fruit
and
bunch
of
violets
in
her
pocket
she
would
have
believed
it
a
dream
but
when
she
went
into
the
house
and
gave
grace
and
jessie
the
peaches
and
her
mother
the
big
beautiful
violets
and
began
doing
all
sorts
of
kind
things
for
every
one
she
felt
how
very
real
it
all
had
been
and
then
too
she
would
sing
that
beautiful
song
she
had
heard
in
the
old
woman
star
and
her
father
delighted
caught
her
up
in
his
arms
kissing
her
again
and
again
ruth
did
not
forget
what
the
old
woman
had
told
her
how
she
might
bring
the
beauty
of
heaven
about
her
form
and
when
she
grew
up
people
loved
her
and
said
i
would
rather
look
like
ruth
to
smile
and
speak
like
her
than
to
have
the
brightest
hair
and
bluest
eyes
of
any
court
beauty
the
old
man
story
come
about
me
little
ones
and
i
will
tell
you
my
story
i
seem
old
to
you
now
but
once
i
was
as
young
as
you
i
had
twelve
brothers
and
sisters
but
now
they
are
all
gone
before
me
into
the
better
land
and
i
remain
here
alone
upon
the
earth
without
them
i
am
very
old
my
teeth
have
fallen
away
from
my
mouth
one
by
one
until
they
are
all
gone
my
bald
head
has
a
very
few
gray
hairs
my
ears
are
deaf
so
i
can
scarcely
hear
your
young
sweet
voices
and
the
bright
sky
is
dimmed
to
my
eyes
slowly
my
footsteps
totter
along
the
earth
as
when
i
first
stepped
into
my
mother
outstretched
arms
my
wife
long
ago
went
before
me
to
the
grave
and
i
have
left
many
children
there
many
a
time
have
i
seen
the
green
sod
laid
over
the
grave
of
loved
ones
often
have
i
wept
at
the
sight
of
god
servant
death
but
when
next
he
comes
i
shall
hail
him
with
joy
for
he
will
be
to
me
the
beloved
friend
who
bears
me
to
my
home
above
now
that
i
am
grown
old
god
lovingly
carries
me
back
to
the
days
of
my
childhood
he
sends
many
a
loving
spirit
upon
the
wings
of
consolation
to
bear
me
into
the
fair
region
of
youth
the
scenes
of
the
few
years
since
all
the
noise
and
bustle
of
my
manhood
prime
are
banished
far
away
from
me
and
only
the
stillness
and
quiet
of
my
childhood
close
around
the
last
moments
of
my
earthly
existence
thus
dear
children
bathing
me
in
the
innocence
and
trustful
spirit
of
my
childhood
does
god
prepare
me
for
my
home
in
his
beautiful
garden
i
told
you
i
had
twelve
brothers
and
sisters
o
well
do
i
recall
them
all
they
come
near
and
i
feel
their
presence
as
of
old
i
am
glad
to
linger
mostly
on
their
early
days
for
in
after
life
their
hearts
were
filled
with
sorrow
their
fresh
spirits
wearied
and
care
brought
and
filled
their
souls
with
other
feelings
than
those
of
love
and
sympathy
to
others
our
fairest
and
brightest
brother
was
fred
i
was
only
one
year
younger
than
he
and
i
remember
well
how
i
watched
my
mother
while
she
nursed
him
and
sent
me
away
from
the
arms
which
a
little
before
had
been
my
sole
possession
i
could
not
understand
it
and
my
little
heart
was
filled
with
dismay
i
would
creep
away
by
myself
sit
down
and
in
the
most
pitiful
manner
repeat
to
myself
poor
sammy
poor
sammy
the
sense
of
desolation
was
very
great
and
in
the
whole
course
of
my
life
i
do
not
remember
to
have
known
a
more
distressing
grief
when
i
grew
to
be
a
man
and
disappointments
came
upon
me
when
i
laid
my
wife
and
children
in
their
graves
and
knew
there
was
not
one
left
of
my
line
but
myself
a
miserable
old
man
there
was
hope
in
my
sorrow
light
in
my
darkness
for
i
knew
the
love
of
god
and
the
life
of
eternity
these
deep
sorrows
had
also
bright
heights
but
it
was
not
so
then
i
could
not
feel
god
love
my
mother
care
had
been
all
i
knew
and
now
that
it
seemed
given
to
another
i
was
alone
and
wretched
there
was
a
terrible
sense
of
injustice
which
nearly
broke
my
heart
i
could
not
understand
how
my
little
brother
could
have
the
right
to
what
was
denied
me
i
have
always
tenderly
pitied
children
who
had
griefs
then
they
need
our
care
more
than
the
grown
children
who
feel
god
love
and
wisdom
but
these
little
ones
grope
in
a
kind
of
darkness
suffering
is
a
mystery
to
them
they
can
perceive
no
cause
or
end
for
it
they
only
know
they
suffer
after
a
while
i
too
was
allowed
to
sit
on
my
mother
lap
with
this
brother
and
then
i
began
to
love
him
he
was
beautiful
there
was
no
child
in
the
county
which
could
be
compared
with
him
and
simply
because
of
his
beauty
and
his
cunning
ways
he
gained
the
power
of
a
king
over
the
household
so
that
as
soon
as
he
began
to
run
about
he
ruled
it
and
me
even
more
than
the
rest
the
country
was
very
new
then
and
all
the
gay
flourishing
towns
and
villages
which
are
now
scattered
in
every
direction
scarcely
existed
even
in
the
minds
of
the
first
sanguine
settlers
dark
woods
and
sombre
swamps
covered
the
surface
and
what
do
you
think
we
had
instead
of
roads
when
we
wanted
to
go
from
one
town
to
another
the
first
one
who
found
his
way
along
cut
pieces
of
bark
out
of
the
trees
and
others
followed
these
marks
until
after
a
time
they
cut
down
the
trees
and
made
a
road
i
think
this
is
the
reason
old
roads
in
this
country
are
so
crooked
for
you
know
a
man
can
not
walk
very
straight
through
a
forest
our
near
neighbors
lived
a
mile
from
us
and
it
was
quite
a
little
journey
to
go
and
see
them
we
had
a
village
too
in
which
were
but
two
buildings
the
and
blacksmith
shop
you
children
would
hardly
think
you
could
live
in
such
a
place
yet
such
was
the
state
of
things
years
ago
well
my
father
and
mother
had
come
up
from
a
town
near
boston
because
my
grandfather
could
give
them
some
land
here
and
they
built
their
house
and
made
it
their
home
the
house
stands
now
it
is
the
very
one
in
which
my
brothers
and
sisters
were
all
born
in
her
parlor
my
mother
had
a
very
nice
piece
of
furniture
which
her
mother
had
given
her
as
a
wedding
present
and
of
which
she
was
very
proud
inasmuch
as
no
parlor
in
the
county
could
boast
the
like
it
was
a
well
laugh
no
wonder
it
seems
funny
to
you
that
any
one
should
so
prize
a
when
you
all
have
so
many
of
them
but
you
can
have
no
idea
how
different
everything
was
then
the
people
were
very
poor
and
although
they
owned
many
acres
of
land
yet
they
could
frequently
sell
it
but
for
one
dollar
an
acre
and
thought
that
a
fine
bargain
you
see
we
had
no
money
to
buy
the
elegant
luxuries
you
have
in
your
houses
the
carpets
and
sofas
and
our
floors
were
hard
covered
now
and
then
with
a
little
sand
perhaps
as
a
great
luxury
the
chairs
were
straight
and
high
while
our
tables
were
small
and
low
and
the
cups
from
which
we
drank
our
tea
as
small
as
those
you
play
with
but
before
i
say
any
more
i
want
to
tell
you
of
the
fate
of
mother
the
as
mother
parlor
was
called
was
always
kept
carefully
closed
and
a
very
sacred
awful
and
mysterious
place
it
was
to
us
children
it
so
happened
one
day
when
mother
had
gone
away
that
my
little
brother
fred
began
to
be
acted
upon
very
powerfully
by
a
desire
to
take
one
peep
into
that
room
by
some
strange
neglect
mother
had
left
the
door
unlatched
for
she
kept
her
bonnet
in
there
and
always
put
it
on
before
the
glass
the
temptation
to
go
in
was
altogether
too
powerful
for
fred
to
withstand
and
especially
as
others
had
never
pronounced
the
little
monosyllable
no
to
him
he
had
no
mind
to
begin
by
saying
it
to
himself
so
in
he
went
and
almost
the
first
thing
he
saw
was
mother
hanging
over
the
table
between
the
two
front
windows
as
he
went
towards
it
he
saw
a
little
boy
who
seemed
to
be
peering
and
staring
at
him
from
between
the
windows
he
had
no
idea
it
was
himself
he
saw
never
having
seen
the
before
nor
his
own
reflected
image
you
may
be
sure
he
looked
right
earnestly
upon
the
strange
child
if
he
stepped
forward
so
did
the
boy
if
he
turned
away
and
then
looked
cautiously
back
to
watch
the
boy
there
he
was
looking
at
him
in
a
very
sly
manner
freddy
enraged
at
this
rushed
out
for
a
stone
and
bringing
it
in
hurled
it
at
the
but
it
was
all
in
vain
for
even
after
the
glass
rattled
down
and
strewed
the
floor
with
its
many
pieces
that
impudent
boy
peeped
at
him
from
every
bit
of
glass
in
which
he
looked
when
my
mother
came
home
and
went
to
put
away
her
bonnet
in
the
great
room
as
usual
she
found
her
beautiful
lying
on
the
floor
broken
into
a
hundred
pieces
when
she
came
out
and
demanded
of
us
what
it
meant
fred
told
her
of
a
little
boy
he
saw
behind
it
at
whom
he
was
offended
and
hurled
a
stone
but
that
still
the
boy
looked
at
him
from
the
pieces
of
glass
and
made
him
very
angry
then
mother
laughed
when
she
heard
fred
story
and
catching
him
up
in
her
arms
kissed
him
again
and
again
she
forgot
to
chide
him
for
his
disobedience
in
going
where
he
had
been
forbidden
to
go
and
for
his
foolish
anger
at
the
supposed
boy
she
was
so
much
amused
at
his
version
of
the
story
that
she
did
not
explain
to
him
what
the
boy
was
and
how
the
reflected
figures
before
it
but
he
was
left
to
find
that
out
by
his
experience
afterwards
if
my
brother
long
before
that
had
learned
lessons
of
love
and
forbearance
this
circumstance
slight
as
it
may
seem
would
never
have
occurred
instead
of
the
threatening
and
distrustful
look
in
the
mirror
he
would
have
found
a
laughing
face
and
a
tiny
loving
hand
would
have
been
given
him
o
my
dear
children
this
story
has
a
higher
meaning
than
i
thought
of
when
i
commenced
in
the
feelings
of
those
whom
we
approach
we
see
the
reflection
of
our
own
if
we
approach
any
one
with
love
it
is
given
to
us
from
them
think
of
this
it
will
serve
you
well
and
teach
you
to
be
careful
ere
you
hurl
the
stone
to
know
what
is
the
object
of
your
anger
i
have
often
thought
that
we
all
helped
to
make
my
brother
selfish
he
was
so
very
beautiful
that
we
indulged
him
in
every
whim
he
had
so
he
came
to
look
upon
us
at
last
as
bound
to
serve
him
i
do
not
blame
him
only
they
who
had
the
nurturing
of
him
they
to
whom
his
young
spirit
was
sent
so
fair
from
god
heavenly
gardens
in
their
unwise
love
taught
him
to
think
of
himself
and
make
others
serve
his
purposes
these
dear
helpless
little
ones
they
come
to
us
in
fresh
beauty
like
a
spring
morning
and
we
taint
their
spirits
with
selfishness
and
darken
them
with
worldly
care
years
after
when
my
brother
and
myself
had
grown
to
men
we
bound
our
interests
in
one
he
had
quicker
parts
than
i
was
a
much
better
scholar
so
i
trusted
all
our
business
confidently
in
his
hands
but
i
grieve
to
say
he
did
not
meet
my
confidence
with
honor
he
took
from
my
purse
to
enrich
his
own
and
when
i
stood
by
his
bedside
at
last
and
saw
how
the
deep
wrinkles
were
worn
in
by
care
upon
his
once
round
cheek
i
wept
i
wept
that
he
should
die
without
having
found
in
life
that
peace
which
any
one
would
have
predicted
for
him
over
his
cradle
when
the
rosy
cheeks
sank
into
the
soft
pillow
and
the
long
lashes
of
his
baby
eyelids
rested
upon
them
i
love
that
brother
now
and
his
child
who
had
become
penniless
after
his
death
i
warmed
in
my
and
held
to
my
heart
as
though
she
had
been
my
own
child
brother
i
know
thou
hast
repented
long
ago
of
the
wrongs
thou
didst
inflict
and
that
some
time
in
the
presence
of
god
i
shall
clasp
thee
in
my
arms
pure
again
as
when
we
sat
together
on
our
knee
see
how
i
have
wandered
away
off
from
my
story
let
me
tell
you
how
we
got
our
clothes
did
you
ever
ask
yourself
what
we
could
do
then
when
there
were
so
few
shops
and
so
little
money
to
carry
to
the
shops
we
had
sheep
who
gave
us
wool
which
my
mother
spun
and
wove
it
into
cloth
just
think
of
that
do
you
imagine
you
would
have
as
fine
clothes
if
your
mothers
had
to
spin
all
the
cloth
she
knit
too
o
so
fast
as
well
in
the
dark
as
the
light
i
have
known
her
to
knit
a
coarse
stocking
easily
of
an
evening
her
fingers
along
the
needles
cotton
cloth
was
a
great
rarity
among
us
i
remember
once
my
mother
had
a
cotton
gown
and
it
was
esteemed
very
precious
father
made
our
shoes
and
rough
ones
they
were
too
and
which
we
only
wore
in
the
coldest
part
of
the
winter
the
long
winter
evenings
were
so
beautiful
to
us
father
taught
us
to
read
and
spell
and
chalked
out
sums
on
the
wall
for
us
then
we
would
draw
profiles
on
the
wall
for
the
great
blaze
of
the
cast
a
bright
light
and
consequently
the
shadow
was
well
marked
a
huge
we
had
with
a
broad
hearth
and
all
about
this
would
we
sit
roasting
apples
and
popping
corn
by
the
heat
of
the
fire
so
we
lived
in
the
summer
playing
around
the
corners
of
the
barn
and
in
the
winter
living
snugly
in
the
telling
stories
when
the
revolutionary
war
broke
out
you
heard
of
that
of
course
but
then
i
afraid
you
never
know
how
much
we
endured
then
our
feeling
against
the
injustice
of
mother
england
was
very
great
you
do
not
know
how
we
had
loved
her
nor
how
we
children
used
to
listen
to
stories
of
that
beautiful
country
beyond
the
sea
our
father
and
mother
spoke
of
it
as
home
and
we
all
hoped
that
some
time
when
we
were
men
and
women
we
might
go
home
then
when
she
began
to
tax
us
for
more
money
than
we
were
able
to
pay
in
order
to
build
grand
palaces
it
seemed
hard
to
us
and
even
after
we
had
remonstrated
again
and
again
she
took
no
notice
of
our
petitions
she
laid
a
heavy
tax
on
some
little
comforts
we
had
such
as
and
molasses
and
then
when
we
refused
to
buy
them
rather
than
pay
the
tax
she
imposed
a
heavy
tax
on
tea
and
sent
a
great
deal
of
it
here
to
force
us
to
buy
it
we
would
have
the
tea
however
and
you
must
have
heard
how
a
party
of
men
disguised
as
indians
threw
it
all
into
boston
harbor
all
these
things
seemed
the
more
cruel
because
they
came
from
home
and
finally
worn
out
with
the
injustice
constantly
experienced
at
their
hands
we
prepared
to
resist
them
by
war
the
declaration
of
independence
which
you
celebrate
every
fourth
of
july
was
received
with
mingled
emotions
of
joy
and
sorrow
it
was
severing
an
old
tie
which
had
once
been
sweet
but
yet
it
promised
us
through
the
doubtful
conflict
freedom
and
independence
how
enthusiastic
we
children
were
father
made
us
rude
wooden
guns
and
drilled
us
every
morning
for
no
one
knew
how
long
the
war
would
last
but
we
were
determined
to
conquer
even
though
our
fathers
died
in
the
war
and
our
children
succeeded
to
it
i
remember
when
the
recruiting
army
came
round
i
seized
my
gun
and
manfully
joined
its
ranks
but
to
my
dismay
i
was
sent
back
my
wooden
gun
and
extreme
youth
were
thought
insufficient
to
meet
the
demands
of
a
soldier
duty
i
remember
well
when
the
battle
was
fought
on
bunker
hill
a
great
part
of
the
town
was
gathered
upon
a
slight
elevation
from
which
we
could
distinctly
hear
the
roaring
of
the
cannons
and
the
clashing
of
the
artillery
it
was
a
terrible
day
there
was
many
a
woman
there
who
had
a
father
or
husband
in
the
battle
and
at
each
report
which
filled
their
ears
they
fancied
they
saw
them
falling
before
the
foe
and
trampled
beneath
the
feet
of
the
conquerors
those
were
trying
times
children
i
pray
god
you
may
never
know
such
and
you
never
can
for
you
will
not
struggle
with
poverty
as
we
did
when
i
look
upon
your
happy
faces
and
see
the
satchel
full
of
books
on
your
arm
when
i
look
in
upon
your
happy
homes
upon
the
career
of
honor
and
usefulness
before
you
in
the
future
i
am
by
the
strong
contrast
transported
to
those
trying
times
when
we
lived
in
the
cold
houses
and
wore
the
coarse
cloth
when
we
sacrificed
the
refinements
of
knowledge
and
the
pleasures
of
luxury
to
the
bold
struggle
of
liberty
against
tyranny
when
our
mothers
at
home
melted
their
last
pewter
plate
that
the
guns
should
know
no
lack
of
bullets
and
sent
all
the
little
comforts
of
food
and
clothing
they
could
find
to
bless
the
husbands
and
fathers
toiling
in
the
war
and
when
the
fathers
fought
with
the
fangs
of
thirst
and
hunger
fast
upon
them
and
leaving
behind
them
upon
the
sharp
ice
the
traces
of
their
footsteps
engraven
by
their
bleeding
feet
then
children
tears
of
joy
and
gratitude
fill
my
eyes
for
we
did
not
toil
in
vain
in
you
all
do
i
behold
the
fruits
of
our
labor
we
were
ignorant
that
you
might
be
wise
poor
that
you
might
be
rich
outlawed
and
disgraced
that
you
might
build
up
a
free
and
generous
nation
and
in
reaping
these
privileges
do
not
forget
the
old
man
and
the
old
woman
who
bowed
and
wrinkled
with
age
need
your
kind
hand
have
given
you
these
things
gladly
and
now
before
we
go
to
our
further
toil
in
eternity
let
us
hear
your
blessed
voices
speaking
to
us
in
kind
tones
of
love
let
us
feel
your
young
lips
pressed
upon
our
old
brows
let
us
clasp
your
little
hands
and
feel
the
gladness
with
which
your
attentions
come
to
us
and
when
you
see
an
old
man
alone
with
those
of
his
generation
passed
away
treat
him
tenderly
guide
his
tottering
footsteps
and
bear
with
him
when
he
is
slow
for
he
is
waiting
for
the
kind
servant
death
he
is
thinking
of
a
dear
little
girl
who
long
ago
with
her
blue
eyes
and
golden
hair
her
light
step
and
soft
embrace
went
up
to
live
with
the
angels
and
the
tears
fall
fast
over
his
worn
cheeks
as
he
remembers
the
lone
place
she
left
in
his
heart
for
she
was
the
last
thing
which
had
been
left
him
from
his
broken
family
speak
to
the
old
man
gently
for
his
heart
is
often
in
converse
with
the
beautiful
past
speak
to
him
gently
for
his
soul
dwells
among
the
angels
of
heaven
a
story
of
the
in
one
of
those
tall
splendid
houses
standing
in
proud
streets
in
which
some
poor
people
imagine
heaven
to
dwell
lived
a
little
girl
by
the
name
of
helen
it
was
and
early
in
the
morning
did
she
jump
from
her
bed
and
run
to
look
at
her
stocking
by
the
fireplace
where
it
was
hung
that
santa
claus
need
not
be
troubled
to
hunt
for
it
there
it
hung
filled
full
and
all
about
on
the
sides
had
fallen
the
presents
it
was
not
large
enough
to
hold
o
how
quickly
did
she
empty
its
contents
and
how
delighted
were
her
exclamations
a
beautiful
bracelet
she
said
to
herself
sitting
down
on
the
carpet
and
drawing
her
little
white
feet
under
her
just
such
a
one
with
the
opal
stone
as
i
saw
in
the
window
yesterday
when
i
went
to
walk
with
mamma
on
and
she
sent
me
home
i
know
so
she
could
buy
it
o
and
this
beautiful
book
how
its
edges
shine
what
pictures
let
me
see
your
affectionate
father
i
knew
father
gave
me
that
and
see
the
pretty
cushion
and
the
box
and
the
china
cups
and
plates
for
my
doll
and
o
a
new
silk
dress
for
dolly
and
something
little
away
down
continued
helen
drawing
out
her
hand
and
peeping
into
the
little
stocking
then
putting
her
hand
back
drew
out
a
pretty
ring
for
her
finger
if
this
is
not
nice
i
never
anything
so
pretty
a
ring
and
a
bracelet
o
dear
dear
how
happy
i
am
she
actually
danced
about
the
room
for
joy
and
when
katie
came
to
wash
and
dress
her
she
scampered
around
and
around
her
for
she
could
not
keep
still
there
was
ever
so
much
candy
too
and
she
wanted
only
to
sit
down
and
eat
it
unmindful
of
katie
remonstrances
she
had
been
so
delighted
with
her
presents
as
almost
to
forget
the
merry
christmas
she
was
to
bid
her
father
and
mother
and
so
when
she
went
down
stairs
into
the
where
the
hot
rolls
were
smoking
and
the
loving
parents
waiting
they
had
almost
surprised
her
with
their
wishes
before
she
bethought
herself
then
she
began
to
think
of
a
party
which
was
to
be
at
her
house
and
of
the
and
the
which
so
many
children
would
go
to
see
in
their
best
frocks
and
best
looks
so
after
the
famous
with
its
nice
and
puddings
and
pies
after
the
game
of
romps
with
her
father
and
the
ride
on
the
with
her
brother
who
at
last
from
mere
mischief
had
tipped
her
off
and
sent
her
crying
to
her
mother
she
began
to
think
about
going
there
she
had
seen
herself
nicely
arrayed
in
the
pretty
plaid
dress
with
the
ring
on
her
finger
and
the
opal
bracelet
on
her
arm
which
she
had
found
in
her
stocking
that
morning
then
she
bethought
herself
of
how
all
the
children
were
to
bring
a
few
pieces
of
silver
for
an
offering
to
the
that
it
might
be
sent
off
into
distant
lands
to
children
who
knew
nothing
of
the
blessed
and
the
christmas
he
brought
it
is
true
helen
had
a
bright
box
with
a
hole
in
the
lid
through
which
she
had
dropped
many
a
bright
piece
of
silver
and
it
is
also
true
that
the
box
had
a
lock
and
the
key
of
the
lock
lay
quietly
in
one
of
helen
drawers
but
the
money
there
was
destined
to
some
very
great
and
vague
purpose
and
she
never
would
have
dreamed
of
unlocking
the
box
and
taking
from
it
any
silver
for
the
she
knew
well
enough
papa
would
give
her
money
for
that
purpose
so
to
papa
she
went
and
told
him
what
she
wanted
and
he
proud
that
his
little
girl
should
carry
as
much
as
others
whom
she
would
meet
there
gave
her
a
beautiful
gold
piece
of
money
a
veritable
five
dollars
then
did
helen
speed
along
with
exultation
in
her
heart
exultation
for
the
gold
in
her
tiny
pocket
and
exultation
in
the
very
bright
dress
quilted
pink
bonnet
and
pretty
white
furs
and
she
was
so
often
thinking
what
will
mary
say
when
she
sees
this
not
once
did
helen
ask
herself
what
the
or
he
whom
the
represented
the
saviour
in
heaven
would
say
to
the
gold
she
brought
poor
helen
she
was
not
bringing
the
gold
for
the
children
so
far
away
she
was
bringing
it
because
the
others
would
bring
some
and
she
wanted
hers
seen
of
them
away
down
in
an
obscure
street
where
you
would
not
look
for
anything
kind
or
beautiful
lived
a
brother
and
sister
who
made
each
other
very
happy
in
their
love
their
names
were
johnny
and
susan
johnny
was
a
lame
sick
boy
who
could
not
run
out
of
doors
and
play
like
other
children
it
was
christmas
morning
there
too
even
and
early
had
susan
his
sister
awoke
to
think
of
the
pleasant
visit
she
should
make
in
the
afternoon
at
her
teacher
house
and
she
had
even
stolen
from
her
bed
up
to
johnny
bedside
to
see
if
he
too
was
awake
and
when
she
saw
that
he
was
awake
and
his
countenance
thoughtful
they
began
to
talk
together
about
the
day
pleasure
and
how
susan
was
to
remember
everything
to
tell
it
over
by
night
to
johnny
o
said
susan
to
think
how
beautiful
it
will
be
and
i
never
in
a
fine
house
before
and
the
two
sixpences
we
have
earned
this
week
how
glad
shall
i
be
to
put
them
in
my
teacher
hand
johnny
dear
said
the
little
susan
looking
tenderly
on
her
poor
brother
do
you
not
think
you
need
the
sixpence
yourself
i
could
buy
you
a
sweet
orange
or
something
nice
for
you
to
eat
it
is
so
long
since
you
had
anything
but
bread
and
water
no
said
johnny
i
rather
much
give
it
to
the
i
love
to
lie
here
and
think
about
it
and
of
those
children
so
far
away
who
will
be
glad
when
they
too
know
of
this
beautiful
day
i
think
of
them
so
much
that
i
love
them
susan
and
i
wish
i
had
more
than
the
sixpence
to
send
them
susan
busied
herself
in
preparing
the
breakfast
of
bread
and
water
and
then
when
it
was
over
and
the
work
done
up
she
sat
down
by
the
side
of
johnny
bed
and
read
to
him
out
of
the
little
book
she
had
brought
from
her
and
johnny
forgot
in
the
quiet
peace
of
the
day
how
hard
it
was
to
lie
still
upon
the
bed
when
he
so
often
longed
to
run
out
and
play
thoughts
of
love
came
into
his
heart
and
tears
of
gentleness
into
his
eyes
their
dinner
was
very
different
from
the
one
helen
had
eaten
but
they
were
happy
their
hearts
were
full
of
expectation
and
susan
had
got
herself
quite
ready
and
wrapping
the
two
pieces
of
silver
in
a
piece
of
paper
she
kissed
johnny
and
set
off
on
her
way
to
the
house
but
when
susan
came
among
the
children
there
somehow
they
all
shunned
her
in
their
plays
if
they
had
occasion
to
speak
to
her
they
passed
on
quickly
with
a
suppressed
smile
and
hurried
glance
on
each
other
if
by
any
means
she
spoke
to
them
they
looked
upon
her
in
astonishment
without
answering
her
words
they
often
whispered
one
to
another
casting
curious
looks
upon
her
so
she
knew
easily
they
spoke
of
her
what
could
it
mean
what
had
she
done
i
can
not
answer
this
well
she
had
a
gentle
sweet
face
her
manners
were
neither
rude
nor
obtrusive
and
when
she
spoke
though
her
tones
were
low
half
fearful
and
trembling
still
were
her
words
as
kind
and
polite
if
not
kinder
and
politer
than
those
of
the
other
children
poor
susan
and
she
had
thought
to
be
so
happy
that
afternoon
she
had
anticipated
only
kindly
faces
and
loving
glances
and
kind
hands
stretched
out
to
her
in
the
plays
for
once
she
had
thought
to
mingle
with
those
pretty
children
as
if
they
had
been
her
sisters
and
when
she
went
back
to
dear
johnny
to
tell
him
of
their
loving
words
but
now
what
could
she
tell
johnny
to
grieve
him
of
the
sad
afternoon
she
was
passing
she
looked
upon
them
more
closely
trying
to
find
out
what
it
was
that
separated
her
from
them
is
true
she
wore
no
bright
plaid
dress
and
delicate
cloth
boots
she
wore
no
bracelets
on
her
arm
she
had
not
found
them
in
her
stocking
that
morning
there
was
no
necklace
about
her
neck
her
hair
was
not
bright
and
curling
yet
still
what
could
be
the
reason
they
shunned
her
so
susan
tremblingly
looked
over
her
own
dress
her
gown
was
scanty
and
of
cotton
her
pantalets
were
long
and
narrow
but
they
were
the
best
she
had
her
mother
had
made
them
long
ago
and
susan
had
so
carefully
preserved
them
on
her
feet
she
wore
thick
leather
shoes
but
she
knew
how
the
money
had
been
saved
little
by
little
from
week
to
week
that
they
might
be
bought
if
they
were
thick
it
was
that
they
might
last
the
longer
and
her
hair
was
combed
smoothly
over
her
brow
and
braided
on
her
neck
her
hands
it
is
true
were
not
delicate
like
theirs
they
were
hard
and
red
but
they
had
become
so
in
working
for
the
home
to
keep
it
clean
and
working
early
and
late
that
the
mother
might
not
be
detained
from
her
work
out
and
that
the
lame
sick
brother
should
have
no
little
want
unsupplied
and
was
it
that
her
hands
were
red
and
her
clothes
coarse
that
the
children
shunned
her
even
too
before
they
looked
into
her
little
home
and
saw
what
she
did
there
how
she
comforted
johnny
and
swept
clean
the
floor
and
even
found
some
time
to
read
out
of
her
books
could
they
with
their
bright
frocks
and
rosy
cheeks
have
such
very
weak
and
wicked
causes
for
their
displeasure
against
this
poor
child
could
they
so
willingly
hurt
her
heart
when
she
had
come
from
so
many
days
of
toil
to
what
she
had
thought
would
be
a
day
of
pleasure
so
that
she
must
often
turn
her
head
to
wipe
off
the
tears
with
her
little
red
hand
and
these
children
had
they
come
to
honor
the
their
teacher
had
watched
their
games
and
saw
how
they
played
among
themselves
and
cast
out
the
little
susan
from
their
play
and
she
thought
that
not
only
did
they
dishonor
the
but
her
who
had
brought
them
all
together
but
susan
still
thought
of
the
the
present
it
should
bear
for
her
and
how
she
should
take
hers
home
for
johnny
and
she
thought
too
of
the
two
little
sixpences
done
up
in
the
paper
in
her
pocket
helen
too
was
not
unmindful
of
her
bright
and
had
taken
good
care
to
show
it
before
the
eyes
of
all
the
children
and
susan
had
seen
it
and
thought
of
johnny
how
he
had
said
he
wished
he
had
still
more
to
send
to
the
children
so
far
away
and
she
thought
the
little
girl
with
the
must
be
happy
enough
to
send
it
and
she
began
to
feel
half
ashamed
that
she
had
no
more
money
and
as
their
unkind
looks
continued
she
asked
herself
if
she
had
any
right
to
be
there
but
the
was
ready
a
servant
came
in
and
closed
tightly
the
shutters
so
the
room
was
all
dark
and
then
the
were
thrown
open
and
there
stood
the
tall
beautiful
tree
with
candles
of
all
colors
which
were
burning
like
so
many
stars
and
above
it
hung
the
with
a
smile
as
of
love
and
his
arms
stretched
out
as
he
would
call
them
to
him
and
on
the
tree
were
nice
gifts
books
and
toys
pictures
and
lace
bags
tied
with
gay
ribbons
filled
with
candies
but
helen
and
all
the
children
who
had
found
rich
gifts
in
their
stockings
that
morning
turned
indifferently
from
these
admiring
the
novelty
of
the
but
to
the
child
they
had
neglected
the
little
girl
in
the
cotton
gown
and
coarse
thick
shoes
the
little
susan
these
gifts
as
well
as
the
tree
were
very
precious
for
she
had
not
jumped
eagerly
from
her
bed
that
morning
to
find
rich
presents
in
her
stockings
for
she
did
not
expect
them
to
be
there
she
had
awoke
early
to
think
of
the
visit
to
the
teacher
house
the
sight
at
the
tree
and
the
gifts
it
should
bear
for
her
and
johnny
so
she
prized
her
gift
more
than
all
when
the
children
saw
how
carefully
she
put
the
little
bags
of
sweetmeats
in
her
pocket
instead
of
eating
them
as
they
did
they
laughed
among
themselves
and
said
something
about
her
which
was
and
so
unjust
that
i
shall
not
even
tell
you
what
it
was
they
did
not
know
she
was
saving
the
candy
to
eat
with
johnny
then
when
she
pondered
over
her
little
book
in
admiration
and
held
it
carefully
in
her
hands
as
though
she
was
fearful
of
stretching
it
they
said
to
themselves
she
must
be
very
ignorant
to
care
for
such
a
thing
but
susan
only
shrank
off
by
herself
thankful
to
have
her
portion
in
these
things
after
this
came
the
time
when
they
would
bring
their
offerings
for
those
children
who
live
in
the
lands
where
there
is
no
christmas
and
the
children
began
to
wonder
if
susan
had
any
money
and
to
show
each
other
what
they
had
then
their
teacher
drew
her
chair
among
them
and
began
to
tell
them
what
it
really
was
to
wish
that
others
might
enjoy
what
we
did
what
it
was
to
help
them
to
do
so
and
be
careful
not
to
rob
them
of
one
smile
this
money
which
you
would
send
to
those
children
that
they
may
be
happy
as
you
are
if
it
does
not
tell
them
of
your
love
is
useless
to
them
and
if
to
obtain
it
you
have
in
any
way
denied
yourself
of
one
little
thing
be
sure
god
will
look
very
lovingly
upon
you
and
those
children
when
you
meet
them
in
heaven
will
put
their
arms
about
you
and
tell
you
of
their
gratitude
when
the
teacher
said
these
last
words
susan
lip
quivered
and
her
eye
sparkled
for
they
were
words
of
meaning
to
her
but
they
did
not
affect
the
other
children
for
they
were
words
of
no
meaning
to
them
but
susan
saw
those
children
in
heaven
in
her
fancy
and
johnny
was
there
no
longer
lame
and
sick
they
ran
and
played
over
bright
fields
and
no
one
laughed
at
them
or
repulsed
them
or
wore
brighter
clothes
than
they
they
threw
garlands
of
flowers
to
each
other
and
when
they
laughed
the
tones
of
their
voices
were
like
music
then
the
teacher
called
susan
to
her
side
and
susan
put
in
her
hand
the
two
little
pieces
of
silver
and
the
children
when
they
saw
how
carefully
they
had
been
wrapped
in
the
bit
of
paper
exchanged
glances
and
they
who
had
the
most
money
in
their
pockets
smiled
scornfully
as
children
can
upon
one
another
the
teacher
asks
susan
how
the
little
money
was
got
and
the
child
answers
in
a
low
tone
please
they
are
johnny
and
mine
we
saved
them
since
you
told
us
so
long
ago
and
the
teacher
as
she
thinks
of
the
lame
sick
johnny
and
what
those
pennies
might
have
bought
him
how
he
had
denied
himself
feels
the
tears
come
into
her
eyes
and
she
speaks
to
the
children
of
johnny
and
tells
susan
that
when
she
comes
into
heaven
she
shall
certainly
see
the
children
she
blesses
now
but
when
she
calls
the
others
to
her
and
they
show
her
the
money
so
easily
obtained
the
teacher
will
not
take
it
since
you
denied
yourself
not
one
thing
for
it
how
do
i
know
made
you
bring
it
and
if
love
did
not
send
it
how
could
it
make
the
children
happy
and
how
can
you
love
those
so
far
off
when
you
have
all
helped
to
make
this
christmas
afternoon
so
unhappy
a
one
to
one
of
the
children
i
invited
here
with
you
if
you
love
not
those
close
by
you
you
can
not
love
those
at
a
distance
she
told
them
how
susan
nursed
her
sick
brother
how
she
read
to
him
watched
over
him
with
cheerful
smile
and
kind
love
what
she
did
for
her
brother
comfort
and
she
showed
them
that
the
two
pieces
of
silver
from
johnny
and
susan
were
really
worth
more
in
the
sight
of
god
than
their
silver
dollars
and
gold
pieces
then
she
told
them
a
story
when
christ
was
one
day
sitting
in
the
temple
he
looked
upon
all
those
who
came
to
put
money
in
the
treasury
many
rich
people
with
proud
airs
and
haughty
hearts
threw
in
large
sums
of
money
people
called
them
benevolent
and
sang
loud
praises
to
them
but
jesus
did
not
call
them
benevolent
neither
did
he
praise
them
at
last
came
a
poor
widow
bringing
with
her
two
mites
which
made
one
penny
she
had
saved
them
of
all
she
had
and
humbly
with
love
in
her
heart
she
threw
them
into
the
treasury
what
a
little
in
comparison
with
what
the
others
had
thrown
there
and
yet
jesus
who
before
had
not
spoken
said
of
her
i
say
unto
you
this
poor
widow
hath
cast
more
in
than
all
they
which
have
cast
into
the
treasury
for
all
they
did
cast
in
of
their
abundance
but
of
her
want
did
cast
in
all
that
she
had
even
her
living
and
the
teacher
was
careful
to
tell
them
it
was
the
spirit
of
love
in
which
the
two
mites
were
brought
not
simply
that
they
were
two
mites
which
made
christ
bless
the
woman
for
if
in
the
same
spirit
she
had
brought
twenty
mites
her
blessing
would
have
been
the
same
the
children
saw
then
how
shameful
had
been
their
conduct
and
it
seemed
just
to
them
that
the
should
refuse
their
offerings
but
they
asked
if
they
might
not
give
their
money
to
susan
and
johnny
no
replied
the
teacher
she
does
not
need
your
money
she
could
give
you
nothing
in
return
for
it
but
instead
you
may
give
her
your
love
that
she
would
like
and
can
return
and
when
you
have
learned
well
your
lessons
of
kindness
give
the
money
where
love
prompts
you
and
from
that
time
they
began
to
learn
these
lessons
they
saw
how
susan
if
her
clothes
coarse
had
in
her
heart
what
was
worth
more
than
fine
clothes
and
all
the
riches
which
are
in
the
world
and
if
they
would
have
their
gifts
acceptable
to
the
they
must
have
such
in
their
hearts
susan
went
home
happy
bearing
on
her
arm
a
basket
of
grapes
and
oranges
for
johnny
to
tell
him
how
the
teacher
had
sent
them
to
him
and
that
they
must
be
more
and
more
loving
and
since
their
god
would
love
them

prudy
compared
with
her
all
other
are
cold
creations
of
literature
only
she
alone
is
the
real
thing
all
the
quaintness
of
childhood
its
originality
its

its
teasing
its
infinite

drollery
the

the

the

doubtless
be

reason
of
the

we
have
only
to
be
greatful
that
the
author
did
not
inflict
on
us
the
customary
alliteration
in
her
pseudonyme
the
rare
gift
of
delineating
childhood
is
hers

may
the
line
of

go
out
