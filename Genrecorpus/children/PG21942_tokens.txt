chapter
i
of
course
there
was
a
baby
in
the
case
a
baby
and
mongrel
dog
and
a
little
boy
and
girl
they
baby
was
small
and
not
particularly
fair
but
it
had
round
limbs
and
a
dimple
or
two
and
a
soft
doggy
look
in
its
blue
eyes
and
the
usual
knack
which
most
helpless
little
babies
have
of
twining
itself
round
the
hearts
of
those
who
took
care
of
it
the
caretakers
of
this
baby
were
the
two
children
and
the
dog
of
course
a
woman
who
went
by
the
name
of
nurse
did
duty
somewhere
in
the
background
she
washed
the
baby
and
dressed
it
in
the
morning
and
she
undressed
it
at
night
and
she
prepared
food
for
it
but
the
caretakers
who
called
up
smiles
to
the
little
white
face
who
caused
the
baby
to
show
that
enticing
little
dimple
which
it
had
in
one
of
its
cheeks
who
made
that
strange
sweet
look
come
into
its
eyes
were
the
children
and
the
dog
the
baby
had
a
sad
history
it
had
entered
the
world
with
sorrow
its
mother
had
died
at
its
birth
and
the
little
wee
orphan
creature
had
been
brought
away
almost
directly
to
an
uncle
house
must
do
it
wife
said
mr
franklin
poor
john
died
two
months
back
and
now
there
his
widow
following
him
poor
creature
and
no
one
to
look
after
that
wee
mite
of
a
babe
we
must
have
it
here
our
plain
duty
and
i
do
suppose
one
extra
mouth
to
feed
can
make
much
difference
all
you
men
know
replied
mrs
franklin
who
was
a
very
tall
thin
woman
difference
indeed
a
baby
make
no
difference
and
who
to
tend
on
the
lodgers
and
bring
in
the
grist
to
the
mill
if
all
my
time
day
and
night
is
taken
up
minding
the
baby
well
said
mr
franklin
he
was
as
peaceable
as
his
wife
was
the
reverse
he
did
not
want
the
baby
but
neither
did
he
wish
to
send
poor
john
child
to
the
workhouse
must
make
the
best
of
it
wife
he
said
help
you
and
i
daresay
peter
and
flossy
will
take
a
turn
in
looking
after
the
young
mrs
franklin
said
no
more
she
went
and
got
a
certain
disused
attic
into
some
sort
of
order
the
attic
was
far
away
from
the
rest
of
the
house
it
was
the
top
story
of
a
wing
which
had
been
added
on
to
the
tall
ramshackle
old
house
in
some
of
the
rooms
underneath
the
franklin
family
themselves
slept
in
others
they
lived
and
in
others
they
cooked
the
rest
of
the
house
therefore
was
free
for
the
accommodation
of
lodgers
mrs
franklin
earned
the
family
bread
by
taking
in
lodgers
she
was
far
more
active
than
her
husband
who
had
a
very
small
clerkship
in
the
city
without
her
aid
the
children
peter
and
flossy
could
scarcely
have
lived
but
by
dint
of
toiling
from
morning
to
night
of
saving
every
penny
of
turning
and
clothes
and
scrubbing
and
cooking
and
brushing
and
cleaning
mrs
franklin
contrived
to
make
two
ends
meet
her
lodgers
said
that
the
rooms
they
occupied
were
clean
and
neat
that
their
food
was
well
cooked
and
above
all
things
that
the
house
was
quiet
therefore
they
stayed
on
year
after
year
the
same
people
lived
in
the
parlours
and
occupied
the
genteel
floor
and
hard
as
her
lot
was
mrs
franklin
considered
herself
a
lucky
woman
and
her
neighbours
often
envied
her
the
house
where
the
franklins
lived
was
in
one
of
those
remote
squares
which
are
to
be
found
at
the
back
of
bloomsbury
in
their
day
these
squares
had
seen
fashion
and
life
but
the
gay
world
had
long
long
ago
passed
them
by
and
forgotten
them
and
in
consequence
although
the
houses
were
large
and
commodious
the
rents
were
low
things
had
gone
fairly
well
with
the
franklins
since
they
took
the
old
house
that
is
things
had
gone
fairly
well
until
the
arrival
of
the
baby
but
as
mrs
franklin
said
to
her
husband
no
baby
could
come
into
any
house
without
making
a
sight
of
difference
she
had
only
two
servants
to
help
her
in
all
her
heavy
work
and
how
could
either
she
or
they
devote
much
time
to
nursing
and
tending
a
little
child
the
baby
however
arrived
it
was
sent
up
at
once
to
the
nursery
which
was
hastily
prepared
for
it
flossy
aged
six
and
peter
who
was
between
eight
and
nine
followed
it
and
watched
it
with
profound
and
breathless
interest
while
martha
the
most
trustworthy
of
the
servants
undressed
it
and
fed
it
and
put
it
to
sleep
a
perfect
duck
said
flossy
at
its
wee
little
face
and
is
its
skin
soft
might
we
kiss
it
martha
would
it
break
it
or
anything
if
we
was
to
kiss
it
very
soft
and
tender
like
ai
a
doll
child
said
martha
wo
break
with
you
loving
of
it
kiss
it
flossy
babes
is
meant
for
kissing
of
the
children
bent
down
and
printed
a
tender
salute
on
the
wee
face
and
that
night
they
scarcely
slept
themselves
for
fear
of
disturbing
it
hope
we
be
allowed
to
take
care
of
the
wee
baby
whispered
flossy
to
her
brother
think
we
could
do
it
werry
nice
do
you
peter
replied
peter
would
be
something
to
amuse
us
it
rather
dull
you
know
always
having
to
keep
quiet
on
account
of
the
lodgers
peter
and
flossy
soon
found
they
were
to
have
their
wish
martha
could
only
spare
a
very
short
time
to
attending
to
the
baby
wants
and
the
poor
little
mite
would
have
had
a
very
unhappy
and
neglected
life
but
for
the
children
as
it
happened
however
the
wee
white
baby
had
not
a
dull
life
of
it
at
all
when
its
teeth
were
not
troubling
it
and
when
it
was
not
very
hungry
it
had
quite
a
merry
time
it
was
devoted
to
the
children
and
even
when
it
was
sending
forth
its
wail
for
more
food
and
some
real
mother
love
it
would
stop
crying
and
give
a
clear
hearty
little
laugh
if
flossy
shook
her
head
of
tangled
hair
in
front
of
it
or
if
the
mongrel
terrier
stood
on
his
and
begged
to
it
peter
and
flossy
had
been
rather
troublesome
children
before
the
arrival
of
the
baby
mrs
franklin
lodgers
were
fond
of
calling
them
termagants
and
liked
exceedingly
to
hint
to
the
mother
that
if
the
termagants
did
not
make
themselves
scarce
they
would
be
obliged
to
seek
other
quarters
poor
mrs
franklin
was
always
extremely
frightened
when
these
things
were
said
for
she
knew
the
rent
and
to
a
certain
extent
the
daily
bread
of
the
children
depended
on
the
lodgers
when
she
learned
that
the
baby
must
inevitably
come
to
them
she
laid
one
very
solemn
command
upon
her
household
no
account
whatever
let
out
to
mrs
sinclair
and
mrs
potts
and
mr
martin
that
there
is
a
baby
in
the
house
if
you
do
go
they
will
and
nothing
that
i
can
possibly
say
will
keep
them
i
terribly
frightened
to
think
how
the
baby
existence
can
be
kept
from
them
but
if
they
know
it
most
certainly
go
they
will
said
flossy
who
was
rather
afraid
of
her
mother
and
did
not
often
put
a
direct
question
to
her
the
baby
stays
up
in
the
old
old
and
if
pete
and
me
and
snip
can
play
with
it
and
it
never
cries
then
mrs
potts
and
mr
martin
need
know
nothing
about
it
need
they
mother
it
never
cries
flossy
they
need
not
know
about
it
answered
mrs
franklin
whoever
yet
heard
of
a
baby
not
crying
of
course
it
will
cry
all
day
and
all
night
i
know
it
will
be
the
ruin
of
us
and
i
think
it
was
very
unkind
of
your
father
to
allow
it
to
be
brought
here
suppose
mother
pete
and
i
play
with
the
baby
and
we
make
it
so
happy
that
it
does
cry
answered
little
flossy
mrs
franklin
gave
a
short
sniff
and
said
in
decidedly
an
unbelieving
voice
may
try
your
best
my
dear
of
course
then
flossy
looked
at
peter
and
peter
looked
back
at
her
and
they
called
and
went
out
of
the
room
this
was
the
way
in
which
the
baby
became
the
children
special
care
she
was
immediately
thrown
upon
their
tender
mercies
they
considered
themselves
answerable
for
her
good
behaviour
and
flossy
almost
wore
herself
out
in
devising
amusements
for
her
she
would
toss
all
her
hair
over
her
face
and
dance
wildly
up
and
down
and
contort
that
same
little
funny
freckled
face
into
all
sorts
of
grimaces
and
when
the
baby
laughed
and
crowed
and
made
chirrupy
sounds
she
was
abundantly
satisfied
peter
too
was
most
ingenious
in
keeping
off
the
fatal
sounds
of
baby
wailing
he
would
blow
into
a
paper
bag
and
then
when
the
baby
had
screwed
up
her
face
and
was
preparing
to
let
out
a
whole
volley
of
direful
notes
he
would
clap
his
hands
violently
on
the
bag
and
cause
it
to
explode
thereby
absolutely
frightening
the
poor
little
creature
into
smiles
peter
would
sing
all
kinds
of
nursery
rhymes
for
the
baby
and
walk
up
and
down
with
it
and
even
run
with
it
until
his
arms
ached
very
badly
indeed
but
after
all
the
one
who
suffered
most
in
the
cause
of
the
baby
was
the
patience
with
which
he
bore
being
dressed
up
in
all
kinds
of
costumes
being
made
to
represent
grannie
with
her
spectacles
and
lame
john
with
his
crutch
and
a
soldier
in
uniform
and
a
sailor
with
a
broken
arm
and
everything
in
the
world
in
short
except
a
spirited
little
dog
with
four
legs
was
truly
wonderful
he
never
did
attempt
to
bite
and
he
was
only
once
guilty
of
barking
but
during
the
grandmother
exhibition
he
could
not
help
throwing
up
his
head
and
giving
a
prolonged
and
unearthly
howl
but
the
naughty
baby
only
laughed
quite
merrily
over
the
howl
and
the
two
children
begged
of
snap
to
do
it
again
he
never
did
howl
any
more
that
was
his
last
despairing
protest
in
future
he
submitted
to
the
baby
caprices
but
with
the
air
of
a
dog
peter
and
flossy
had
commenced
their
care
of
the
baby
without
any
special
love
for
her
but
of
course
they
could
not
long
hold
her
in
their
arms
and
play
with
her
and
think
for
her
and
earnestly
desire
to
win
her
smiles
and
banish
her
tears
without
the
usual
thing
happening
the
baby
stole
their
little
hearts
into
her
own
safe
keeping
notwithstanding
his
sufferings
she
also
stole
heart
after
that
the
baby
was
of
course
mistress
of
the
situation
the
children
took
care
of
her
by
day
and
the
lodgers
knew
nothing
about
her
existence
but
at
night
martha
the
old
nurse
went
into
her
nursery
and
slept
with
her
and
attended
to
her
wants
peter
and
flossy
having
learned
the
mystery
of
amusing
the
small
mite
were
tolerably
happy
about
her
during
the
daytime
but
at
night
they
were
obliged
to
be
parted
from
her
and
in
consequence
at
night
they
were
full
of
fears
martha
meant
to
be
kind
but
she
was
tired
and
she
often
slept
soundly
and
did
not
hear
the
baby
when
she
awoke
and
demanded
attention
flossy
became
quite
a
light
sleeper
herself
and
would
sometimes
steal
into
the
nursery
and
try
to
quiet
the
baby
so
that
on
the
whole
for
some
time
even
at
night
the
lodgers
heard
no
sound
of
the
new
little
inmate
but
all
happy
and
worthy
things
come
to
an
end
and
so
alas
did
the
baby
good
behaviour
there
came
a
night
about
three
months
after
her
arrival
and
when
she
was
about
six
months
old
when
baby
was
very
restless
cross
and
fidgety
with
the
cutting
of
her
first
tooth
the
children
had
quite
worn
themselves
out
in
her
cause
in
the
daytime
and
had
allowed
himself
to
be
arrayed
in
all
his
costumes
for
her
benefit
but
martha
had
come
to
bed
as
tired
and
weary
as
the
baby
herself
and
in
consequence
she
fell
fast
asleep
and
never
heard
the
little
creature
cries
peter
and
flossy
heard
them
at
the
other
side
of
the
wall
and
knowing
that
they
were
much
louder
and
more
piercing
than
usual
they
both
got
up
and
went
to
the
nursery
door
also
followed
them
but
unwillingly
and
with
his
tail
between
his
legs
the
door
on
this
unfortunate
night
was
locked
and
the
children
could
not
get
in
martha
slept
on
and
the
baby
screamed
on
and
presently
poor
peter
and
flossy
heard
mr
martin
get
up
and
ring
his
bell
violently
mrs
potts
was
also
heard
to
open
her
room
door
and
come
out
on
the
landing
and
sniff
in
a
very
disagreeable
way
and
go
back
again
flossy
heart
quite
beat
with
terror
and
peter
said
all
up
flossy
they
all
know
about
our
baby
in
the
morning
they
do
asked
flossy
in
an
voice
do
know
answered
peter
dare
think
something
bad
i
then
the
two
children
crept
back
to
their
beds
and
flossy
cried
herself
to
sleep
the
sleeping
baby
chapter
ii
must
answer
me
this
question
very
decidedly
am
i
to
go
or
the
baby
is
my
night
sleep
to
be
again
disturbed
by
the
peevish
wails
of
a
troublesome
infant
i
must
know
at
once
madam
what
you
intend
to
do
miss
jenkins
over
the
way
has
offered
me
her
front
parlour
with
the
bedroom
behind
and
her
terms
are
lower
than
yours
you
have
but
to
say
the
word
and
my
bed
will
be
well
aired
and
the
room
at
miss
jenkins
all
comfortable
for
me
i
do
want
you
to
turn
that
infant
away
oh
dear
me
no
but
i
must
decide
my
own
plans
stay
in
the
house
with
a
baby
and
have
my
sleep
broken
i
will
not
the
speaker
was
mr
martin
he
had
come
into
mrs
franklin
little
back
parlour
and
expressed
his
mind
very
freely
the
poor
woman
was
standing
up
and
regarding
her
best
lodger
with
a
puzzled
and
almost
despairing
air
she
did
not
know
that
flossy
had
crept
into
the
room
and
was
hiding
herself
behind
her
chair
and
that
flossy
little
face
had
grown
even
more
white
and
despairing
than
her
own
me
until
sir
she
said
potts
has
also
been
in
and
complaining
about
the
poor
child
she
an
orphan
child
and
my
husband
niece
but
we
are
in
no
way
bound
to
support
her
i
would
not
treat
her
badly
sir
but
there
are
limits
and
of
course
as
you
say
your
night
sleep
must
not
be
broken
rather
than
that
should
happen
mr
martin
i
would
send
the
child
to
the
workhouse
for
of
course
she
has
no
legal
claim
on
us
if
you
will
be
so
kind
sir
as
to
give
me
until
morning
i
will
then
let
you
know
what
i
have
decided
to
do
with
the
baby
and
i
faithfully
promise
that
you
are
not
to
be
disturbed
sir
is
all
right
said
mr
martin
with
a
mollified
air
course
it
is
not
to
be
expected
that
an
old
bachelor
such
as
i
am
should
be
worried
by
an
infant
screams
the
screams
of
a
baby
have
to
me
an
appalling
sound
do
what
you
think
well
with
the
child
and
let
me
know
in
the
morning
only
i
may
as
well
state
that
i
think
the
workhouse
an
extreme
measure
then
mr
martin
left
the
house
mrs
franklin
followed
him
out
of
the
room
and
flossy
crept
slowly
back
to
the
nursery
mrs
franklin
did
not
notice
her
little
daughter
and
flossy
did
not
venture
to
address
her
mother
she
came
into
the
room
where
peter
and
were
doing
their
utmost
for
the
baby
peter
had
her
in
his
arms
and
was
walking
up
and
down
with
her
and
was
bounding
after
a
ball
and
tossing
it
into
the
air
for
her
benefit
to
go
peter
said
flossy
guessed
it
i
guessed
it
quite
well
last
night
she
to
go
away
to
the
workhouse
that
what
mother
said
i
heard
her
telling
mr
martin
so
not
said
peter
he
turned
very
pale
and
still
holding
the
child
in
his
arms
sat
down
on
the
nearest
chair
it
is
to
be
doubted
whether
this
poor
neglected
baby
had
ever
been
christened
the
children
had
given
her
a
name
of
their
own
they
had
called
her
dickory
dock
the
reason
they
had
given
her
this
distinctive
title
was
because
the
first
amusement
which
had
brought
a
smile
to
her
little
face
had
been
the
old
play
of
dickory
dock
and
the
mouse
that
ran
up
the
clock
said
it
repeated
flossy
coming
up
close
to
her
brother
and
fixing
her
anxious
eyes
on
the
baby
said
that
our
dickory
was
to
go
to
the
workhouse
then
she
sha
said
peter
know
nothing
about
workhouses
but
i
expect
they
are
very
nasty
places
and
dickory
sha
go
there
then
he
sat
silent
his
arm
round
the
little
child
who
looked
up
at
him
and
then
back
at
flossy
and
then
smiled
in
that
wonderfully
pathetic
way
she
had
here
flossy
said
peter
you
are
quite
certain
sure
that
mother
said
the
workhouse
that
she
did
say
nothing
about
dickory
dock
being
put
to
sleep
in
another
room
or
maybe
down
in
the
kitchen
if
you
are
quite
positive
about
the
workhouse
flossy
why
i
know
what
do
did
say
the
workhouse
answered
flossy
heard
her
with
my
own
ears
and
mr
martin
said
it
was
a
stream
measure
i
do
know
what
he
meant
by
that
but
i
do
know
that
mother
said
the
workhouse
and
that
she
has
got
till
morning
to
take
baby
away
she
has
said
peter
take
her
away
first
you
and
me
flossy
you
and
me
and
we
take
our
little
baby
away
and
we
hide
her
dickory
shall
never
go
to
no
workhouse
here
dickory
looked
up
again
at
peter
who
looked
down
at
her
and
kissed
her
and
two
tears
splashed
from
his
eyes
on
her
little
face
what
a
dear
baby
she
is
said
flossy
peter
we
run
away
and
we
take
dickory
where
shall
we
take
her
to
peter
i
do
know
said
peter
get
her
out
of
this
that
the
first
thing
how
much
money
have
you
got
flossy
crooked
halfpenny
said
flossy
in
a
decided
voice
peter
sighed
he
was
older
than
flossy
and
he
knew
that
a
crooked
halfpenny
did
not
represent
a
large
capital
have
got
sixpence
he
said
buy
milk
for
her
we
manage
quite
well
floss
when
mother
goes
out
with
her
slip
downstairs
with
dickory
and
well
take
her
away
and
we
hide
her
somewhere
she
sha
go
to
no
workhouse
the
darling
pet
that
she
sha
the
dear
said
flossy
a
lovely
plan
peter
and
i
just
go
and
watch
on
the
top
of
the
stairs
for
mother
to
go
out
with
the
old
better
take
a
bag
with
us
said
peter
bag
will
come
in
very
handy
it
will
hold
baby
milk
when
we
buy
it
and
some
bread
for
you
and
me
for
we
may
have
to
walk
a
long
way
before
we
find
a
nice
place
for
dickory
children
seldom
take
long
in
carrying
out
their
resolutions
and
mrs
franklin
puzzled
and
anxious
and
with
no
real
intention
of
sending
the
poor
baby
to
the
workhouse
had
not
long
turned
the
corner
of
the
street
before
the
hall
door
of
the
rambling
old
house
was
eagerly
and
nervously
opened
and
a
funny
little
quartette
issued
forth
dickory
did
not
often
get
the
air
and
she
enjoyed
herself
very
much
sitting
well
up
in
peter
arms
and
wrapped
up
head
and
all
in
an
old
tartan
shawl
flossy
holding
the
bag
walked
by
her
brother
side
and
behaved
in
his
usual
erratic
fashion
now
running
before
now
lingering
behind
now
stopping
to
exchange
a
greeting
with
a
or
to
sniff
with
watering
jaws
and
wistful
eyes
at
a
butcher
shop
but
always
returning
faithfully
to
his
charge
and
always
raising
an
inquiring
face
to
see
if
dickory
was
quite
comfortable
she
was
thoroughly
so
and
when
she
crowed
and
laughed
and
chuckled
flossy
wondered
they
had
never
thought
of
taking
her
out
before
the
sun
was
shining
and
the
day
was
bright
and
warm
with
the
promise
of
spring
in
it
and
the
two
children
were
highly
delighted
with
their
scheme
and
not
a
bit
afraid
of
the
result
the
only
thing
which
had
at
all
alarmed
them
was
the
fear
that
mrs
franklin
or
martha
might
find
out
their
little
plan
before
they
had
time
to
carry
it
into
effect
having
succeeded
in
getting
quite
away
with
the
baby
they
considered
their
difficulties
at
an
end
peter
was
old
enough
to
know
that
a
crooked
halfpenny
did
not
mean
much
considered
as
a
provision
for
three
human
beings
and
a
dog
but
he
was
still
sufficiently
young
to
have
perfect
confidence
in
the
capabilities
of
sixpence
for
meeting
the
demands
of
the
hour
as
they
walked
along
flossy
dickory
and
snap
were
all
very
happy
and
peter
too
was
happy
although
his
arms
ached
sadly
but
alas
the
paths
of
the
poor
little
adventurers
were
not
to
be
without
thorns
the
time
was
april
and
an
april
shower
first
damped
the
ardour
of
the
travellers
the
poor
baby
shawl
was
wet
through
and
she
began
to
cry
pitifully
with
hunger
and
want
of
sleep
must
want
her
milk
said
peter
dickory
there
a
darling
now
go
to
sleep
like
the
dear
baby
you
are
know
peter
she
wo
go
to
sleep
without
her
milk
said
flossy
run
across
to
that
and
buy
some
how
much
milk
shall
i
get
peter
said
peter
get
a
flossy
and
we
sit
down
on
the
step
of
this
empty
house
and
feed
the
baby
and
eat
up
our
crusts
ourselves
a
bottle
to
hold
the
milk
was
to
be
found
in
flossy
bag
and
accordingly
in
a
short
time
dickory
had
a
meal
not
quite
what
she
was
accustomed
to
but
sufficient
to
soothe
her
off
into
a
slumber
in
which
she
forgot
the
discomfort
of
her
damp
clothes
and
all
her
other
baby
tribulations
said
peter
have
gone
a
long
way
from
home
now
and
baby
is
asleep
and
resting
nicely
on
my
knee
my
arm
wo
ache
a
bit
when
she
wakes
and
i
be
able
to
carry
her
a
splendid
long
way
we
have
to
think
of
making
up
our
plans
floss
we
have
to
find
some
place
where
we
can
all
sleep
comfortably
we
got
sixpence
said
flossy
lots
and
lots
of
money
but
the
night
is
a
long
way
off
peter
and
i
so
hungry
i
eaten
up
all
the
crusts
that
you
and
left
for
me
but
i
still
as
hungry
as
possible
might
i
spend
a
halfpenny
or
so
of
our
sixpence
in
getting
a
good
dinner
for
you
and
me
and
peter
put
his
hand
to
his
brow
and
began
to
reflect
do
think
so
floss
he
said
i
afraid
you
do
understand
marketing
it
best
for
me
to
go
for
i
quite
old
and
i
know
the
way
mother
talks
to
the
baker
man
and
the
milkman
when
they
come
to
the
door
i
must
be
sharp
with
them
floss
that
what
i
must
be
and
i
do
think
you
could
be
so
you
had
better
hold
the
baby
while
i
fetch
our
dinner
oh
dear
what
a
good
thing
it
is
i
have
got
sixpence
the
baby
being
very
sound
asleep
was
transferred
to
flossy
arms
without
waking
was
left
in
charge
of
the
two
and
peter
who
knew
very
little
more
of
london
and
london
life
than
his
little
sister
started
off
manfully
to
the
round
the
corner
he
had
gone
away
with
a
bright
face
but
he
returned
in
a
very
short
time
with
one
singularly
depressed
a
bit
of
stale
bread
for
each
of
us
he
said
i
had
to
give
two
halfpennies
for
that
i
did
see
such
a
nice
piece
of
beef
and
of
pudding
and
i
ordered
some
for
you
and
me
and
but
the
woman
said
all
that
much
would
cost
three
sixpences
so
then
i
had
to
say
i
would
have
it
and
i
took
the
stale
bread
and
she
was
very
cross
o
floss
i
hope
i
right
about
sixpence
i
hope
it
will
buy
a
bed
for
baby
and
milk
and
food
for
us
all
for
i
thinking
we
had
much
better
none
of
us
go
back
course
we
wo
go
back
said
flossie
stale
and
i
so
hungry
o
peter
do
look
dickory
is
stretching
herself
and
rubbing
her
little
fat
hands
into
her
eyes
and
i
know
going
to
wake
and
i
afraid
she
cry
her
to
me
said
peter
with
the
air
of
a
practised
nurse
hold
her
and
you
can
feed
me
while
i
doing
so
flossy
but
notwithstanding
all
peter
efforts
notwithstanding
his
singing
and
even
shouting
for
the
baby
benefit
notwithstanding
the
admiring
cheers
of
a
little
street
mob
that
collected
round
him
the
baby
cried
not
a
loud
cry
but
a
weak
wail
the
fact
was
the
indifferent
milk
flossy
had
fed
her
with
had
made
her
ill
and
her
little
frame
was
already
sadly
chilled
by
the
damp
shawl
which
she
wore
about
her
poor
dickory
scarcely
ever
got
any
air
or
exercise
and
in
consequence
was
very
susceptible
to
cold
is
sneezing
said
flossy
the
poor
poor
darling
peter
i
think
we
better
see
about
our
night
lodging
soon
it
does
agree
with
dickory
to
keep
her
out
so
long
go
at
once
said
peter
rising
to
his
feet
another
black
cloud
coming
up
and
there
be
a
shower
again
before
long
get
a
nice
room
for
us
four
and
then
we
be
as
happy
as
possible
accordingly
the
little
party
again
moved
forward
and
whenever
peter
or
flossy
saw
a
card
up
in
a
window
they
stopped
and
rang
the
and
inquired
for
lodgings
for
themselves
and
their
baby
of
course
they
were
repulsed
in
all
kinds
of
ways
some
people
merely
laughing
and
shutting
the
door
in
their
faces
some
scolding
them
and
calling
them
tiresome
impertinent
little
brats
and
some
even
threatening
to
tell
the
police
about
them
but
no
one
ever
hinted
at
the
possibility
of
taking
them
in
presently
they
left
the
more
respectable
streets
and
wandered
into
very
poor
quarters
here
doubtless
they
could
have
found
accommodation
were
they
able
to
pay
for
it
but
everybody
laughed
at
peter
pennies
and
no
one
dreamt
of
offering
them
a
shelter
then
the
rain
which
had
threatened
came
down
and
baby
was
again
wet
through
and
now
she
looked
ill
as
well
as
fretful
and
refused
some
fresh
milk
which
flossy
bought
for
her
she
was
not
the
least
like
the
bright
little
dickory
who
used
to
laugh
and
show
her
dimples
in
the
old
at
home
here
said
peter
are
we
to
do
will
be
night
soon
and
we
have
found
no
for
dickory
and
no
one
will
take
us
in
is
not
at
all
well
either
said
flossy
head
is
quite
hot
like
fire
when
i
touch
it
are
we
to
do
asked
peter
ca
get
home
but
it
seems
to
me
floss
that
this
is
worse
for
poor
dickory
than
the
workhouse
tell
you
what
said
flossy
suddenly
raising
her
bright
face
to
peter
take
baby
to
the
lady
what
cried
lady
who
cried
repeated
peter
do
know
nothing
about
her
floss
peter
you
do
know
it
was
that
day
our
uncle
david
took
us
a
long
walk
and
we
went
to
the
cemetery
with
him
you
know
the
place
with
the
flowers
and
the
trees
and
where
they
put
the
pretty
little
children
when
they
die
there
was
a
little
baby
being
put
there
and
there
was
a
lady
crying
very
very
bitter
i
never
saw
no
one
cry
so
dreadful
bitter
as
that
lady
and
they
said
she
was
putting
her
baby
in
the
ground
sure
she
must
want
another
baby
and
i
think
perhaps
it
would
be
right
for
us
to
give
her
dickory
peter
face
became
very
sad
do
know
he
said
do
want
to
give
dickory
away
i
quite
dreadfully
fond
of
her
it
seems
to
me
she
makes
a
lot
of
difference
in
the
house
and
you
know
floss
it
used
to
be
very
dull
before
she
came
said
flossy
love
her
more
than
anything
she
a
dear
baby
and
i
never
find
the
days
long
when
i
playing
with
her
and
talking
to
her
but
you
see
peter
she
not
to
be
kept
at
home
she
to
go
to
the
workhouse
morning
unless
we
can
find
a
nice
for
her
we
ca
find
a
peter
for
though
you
are
a
rich
boy
and
have
got
a
lot
of
pennies
yet
you
have
enough
for
us
to
get
a
room
for
ourselves
and
dickory
and
the
night
air
do
agree
with
her
oh
there
she
sneezing
again
bless
her
the
pet
peter
i
hope
you
always
say
bless
her
when
dickory
sneezes
martha
says
it
lucky
if
you
do
o
peter
i
do
think
if
we
must
part
with
the
baby
it
would
be
better
to
give
her
to
the
lady
who
cried
than
to
send
her
to
the
workhouse
we
do
know
where
the
lady
lives
said
peter
might
do
it
if
we
knew
where
the
lady
lived
but
we
ca
however
much
we
wish
to
if
we
do
i
do
know
answered
flossy
know
quite
well
last
week
i
saw
the
lady
i
was
out
with
mother
and
mother
went
to
the
greengrocer
and
while
she
was
there
the
lady
comed
in
she
was
all
in
black
and
i
am
sure
she
had
been
crying
a
lot
for
she
looked
so
sad
and
i
knew
it
was
her
afterwards
mother
and
i
walked
behind
her
as
she
went
home
and
she
turned
into
a
great
big
house
in
the
square
near
us
you
know
the
square
peter
the
square
that
begins
with
a
big
b
bev
something
i
ca
say
it
all
square
said
peter
in
a
gloomy
voice
yes
that
was
it
and
was
the
number
of
the
house
i
forget
the
number
i
asked
mother
and
she
said
it
was
o
peter
that
where
our
lady
lives
and
i
do
think
it
would
be
better
to
give
her
dickory
there
peter
bless
her
she
sneezing
again
sure
we
had
better
take
her
to
the
lady
right
answered
peter
be
a
termagant
again
when
she
gone
see
if
i
wo
i
get
up
an
awful
racking
cough
at
night
and
worry
that
nasty
mr
martin
much
more
than
dickory
has
worried
him
see
if
i
do
and
i
sing
on
the
stairs
and
i
whistle
awful
loud
and
i
buy
a
with
one
of
my
pennies
i
turn
into
a
horrid
boy
but
i
suppose
you
are
right
about
dickory
flossy
here
let
go
back
as
fast
as
we
can
to
that
house
you
were
so
as
to
take
the
number
of
i
and
i
mean
to
be
so
do
you
expect
nothing
cheerful
from
me
flossy
well
peter
said
flossy
meekly
and
then
the
little
party
slowly
and
painfully
for
flossy
was
very
very
tired
and
poor
peter
arms
ached
fearfully
retraced
their
steps
the
baby
had
ceased
crying
and
was
asleep
and
after
about
two
patient
walking
and
asking
their
way
the
children
found
themselves
in
bevington
square
better
go
up
first
to
the
door
said
flossy
ask
her
if
like
a
baby
you
might
stand
round
there
peter
and
you

lady

and
in
a
few
minutes

dickory

more
peter
unfastened
a
corner
of
the
old
tartan
shawl
and
flossy
imprinted
a
grave
kiss
on
the
baby
forehead
then
with
great
solemnity
and
with
the
air
of
one
engaged
on
an
important
mission
she
went
up
the
steps
of
the
great
house
and
rang
the
bell
flossy
was
an
attractive
little
child
her
hair
was
really
beautiful
and
she
had
a
very
wistful
and
taking
manner
she
said
now
to
the
tall
powdered
footman
know
the
lady
what
cried
is
here
please
can
i
see
her
i
brought
her
a
little
baby
and
i
want
to
see
her
about
it
flossy
did
not
look
quite
like
a
common
child
and
her
face
wore
a
very
sweet
expression
when
she
spoke
of
the
baby
nevertheless
the
footman
only
stared
at
her
and
would
have
certainly
shut
the
door
in
her
face
had
not
the
lady
of
the
house
at
that
moment
come
into
the
hall
flossy
saw
her
and
quick
as
thought
she
darted
past
the
servant
and
up
to
the
lady
lady
she
said
often
thought
of
you
and
i
so
very
sorry
for
you
please
i
brought
you
another
little
baby
instead
of
the
one
you
put
into
the
ground
in
the
pretty
place
where
the
flowers
and
trees
are
she
a
dear
little
baby
and
when
you
have
her
you
wo
cry
no
more
flossy
voice
was
very
earnest
and
her
eyes
looking
up
full
into
the
lady
face
were
full
of
the
most
intense
sympathy
those
pretty
eyes
of
hers
were
too
much
for
the
poor
bereaved
mother
she
put
her
handkerchief
to
her
own
eyes
and
there
and
then
burst
into
fits
of
fresh
weeping
away
little
girl
at
once
said
the
indignant
footman
but
the
lady
put
out
one
of
her
hands
and
took
flossy
the
child
with
me
she
said
to
the
man
be
better
in
a
moment
little
girl
she
continued
then
you
shall
tell
me
what
you
mean
but
you
have
upset
me
talking
about
babies
it
is
not
long
since
i
buried
my
child
my
only
child
saw
you
said
flossy
nodding
her
bright
head
was
in
the
cemetery
and
i
saw
you
oh
did
you
cry
bitter
but
you
need
cry
no
more
now
for
god
has
sent
you
another
little
baby
my
little
girl
said
the
lady
has
not
i
have
asked
him
but
it
is
not
his
will
guessed
you
want
another
baby
said
flossy
knew
quite
well
you
would
and
she
waiting
for
you
round
the
corner
with
peter
and
snap
you
put
on
your
bonnet
and
come
and
look
at
her
she
a
real
beauty
she
got
a
dimple
and
her
name
is
dickory
come
said
the
lady
in
an
excited
voice
the
very
strangest
thing
i
ever
heard
a
child
coming
to
me
like
that
we
slip
out
little
girl
james
need
not
open
the
door
for
us
flossy
wondered
who
james
was
me
your
hand
little
girl
continued
the
lady
take
me
to
the
baby
i
look
at
her
anyhow
peter
was
standing
in
a
very
sulky
attitude
at
the
corner
where
the
railings
were
in
his
heart
of
hearts
he
was
extremely
anxious
that
flossy
mission
should
fail
it
seemed
to
him
that
every
bit
of
the
niceness
all
the
interest
would
go
out
of
his
life
if
he
had
dickory
in
some
ways
he
considered
that
dickory
was
more
to
him
than
she
was
to
flossy
he
wondered
how
flossy
could
even
talk
of
parting
with
her
he
hoped
sincerely
she
would
fail
in
winning
the
lady
pity
but
no
there
they
were
both
coming
to
meet
him
the
tall
lady
in
deep
black
and
little
eager
wistful
flossy
is
the
lady
what
cried
she
said
to
peter
have
come
out
to
see
our
baby
show
her
our
baby
peter
in
solemn
gloomy
silence
peter
unfolded
a
morsel
of
the
tartan
shawl
which
covered
the
baby
face
me
have
her
in
my
arms
please
said
the
lady
she
took
the
baby
tenderly
peeped
once
again
at
its
small
wee
face
felt
a
sudden
glow
coming
back
into
empty
arms
and
more
empty
heart
and
then
turned
again
to
the
children
she
took
the
baby
tenderly
must
be
mad
to
do
such
a
thing
she
said
little
waifs
in
the
street
come
and
offer
me
a
baby
and
i
do
refuse
it
there
baby
for
dickory
began
to
cry
again
baby
hush
sweet
hush
dear
little
baby
hush
this
lady
voice
had
quite
a
new
tone
for
dickory
a
sweeter
tone
even
than
peter
or
flossy
she
stopped
crying
at
once
baby
takes
to
you
said
flossy
in
a
voice
of
thrilling
interest
peter
very
pale
and
still
silent
drew
a
step
nearer
children
said
the
lady
have
made
up
my
mind
i
take
this
baby
home
for
the
night
my
husband
will
think
me
mad
anyone
in
their
senses
would
think
me
mad
but
i
nearly
wild
with
and
that
little
mite
there
pointing
to
flossy
it
and
she
brought
me
the
baby
and
i
say
god
bless
her
for
it
whether
she
a
ragamuffin
or
not
yes
i
have
made
up
my
mind
i
shall
take
the
baby
home
for
night
at
least
in
the
morning
i
shall
make
inquiries
but
for
the
baby
is
mine
milk
half
water
in
her
bottle
said
peter
in
a
very
grave
reproachful
voice
milk
half
water
and
a
little
sugar
and
a
pinch
of
salt
and
dickory
likes
her
feet
kept
werry
warm
come

flossy

please
lady

flossy

franklin
and
we
live
in
montfiore
square
we
lets
lodgings
please
lady
and
it
was
mr
martin
what
turned
so
crusty
about
baby
your
mother
i
will
come
and
see
her
said
the
lady
have
a
mother
i
suppose
oh
yes
she
wanted
to
send
the
baby
to
the
workhouse
do
think
that
will
be
necessary
my
name
is
ross
tell
your
mother
to
expect
me
chapter
iii
it
is
one
thing
to
feel
very
angry
about
a
baby
and
another
to
wish
that
helpless
little
atom
of
humanity
positive
mr
martin
was
an
old
bachelor
and
even
mothers
could
scarcely
blame
him
for
objecting
to
having
his
first
sweet
sleep
disturbed
by
the
wailings
of
a
child
who
was
cutting
its
teeth
mr
martin
meant
what
he
said
when
he
proposed
to
change
lodgings
one
else
can
have
my
present
room
he
remarked
would
be
preposterous
to
send
that
infant
to
the
workhouse
a
less
sensitive
person
than
i
am
can
occupy
my
present
parlour
and
bedroom
comfortable
rooms
too
he
sighed
as
he
went
out
he
was
a
man
who
disliked
change
and
he
felt
that
he
had
been
treated
badly
mrs
franklin
had
no
right
to
bring
a
wailing
niece
of
a
few
weeks
old
into
the
house
where
he
lived
and
it
was
unfair
and
inconsiderate
well
there
was
no
help
for
it
the
baby
had
come
and
could
not
be
displaced
and
now
there
was
nothing
for
it
but
for
him
to
engage
the
rooms
opposite
which
were
certainly
not
nearly
so
nice
nor
so
much
to
his
taste
he
had
promised
mrs
franklin
that
he
would
give
her
a
short
time
to
consider
but
in
his
heart
of
hearts
he
was
quite
certain
that
he
must
take
the
detested
step
mr
martin
was
a
retired
merchant
he
had
plenty
of
money
and
his
working
days
were
over
he
generally
went
to
his
club
in
the
morning
and
he
always
returned
about
one
in
the
day
to
a
comfortable
day
repast
always
sharp
as
the
clock
struck
one
martha
placed
upon
mr
martin
board
a
smoking
steak
done
to
perfection
he
had
the
same
lunch
every
day
he
drank
a
glass
of
ale
with
his
steak
he
required
this
simple
meal
to
be
served
with
regularity
he
insisted
that
his
steak
should
always
be
tender
and
properly
cooked
that
was
all
he
would
not
have
stayed
a
week
in
any
lodgings
where
the
landlady
could
not
provide
him
with
his
steak
and
glass
of
beer
as
he
liked
them
sharp
at
one
he
returned
as
usual
sighing
a
little
as
he
entered
the
square
what
a
troublesome
baby
that
was
what
a
nuisance
it
would
be
to
move
he
doubted
very
much
if
the
people
opposite
knew
how
to
cook
steak
he
let
himself
into
the
house
with
his
latchkey
hung
up
his
coat
and
hat
in
the
hall
he
was
a
most
methodical
old
gentleman
and
turned
into
his
parlour
he
expected
the
usual
scene
to
meet
his
eyes
the
fire
burning
brightly
a
snowy
cloth
on
the
table
and
martha
in
the
act
of
placing
an
appetising
covered
dish
on
the
board
this
homely
and
domestic
scene
however
was
not
destined
to
meet
him
the
fire
in
the
grate
was
out
there
were
no
preparations
for
lunch
on
the
table
and
taking
up
the
greater
part
of
the
light
from
one
of
the
windows
might
have
been
seen
the
portly
form
of
mrs
potts
mrs
potts
was
the
lodger
and
mr
martin
both
dreaded
and
detested
her
he
shrank
back
a
step
or
two
what
was
she
doing
in
his
room
the
absence
of
lunch
was
bad
enough
but
this
unexpected
and
undesired
company
was
insult
on
injury
mr
martin
bowed
cleared
his
throat
and
prepared
to
make
an
elaborate
speech
mrs
potts
interrupted
him
fiercely
good
sir
this
is
no
time
for
ceremony
the
wailing
infant
and
the
two
children
of
the
house
have
been
stolen
since
the
morning
mrs
franklin
is
almost
out
of
her
mind
with
grief
and
suspicion
points
to
you
gracious
madam
what
you
mean
said
poor
mr
martin
in
a
limp
voice
he
sank
down
on
the
nearest
chair
spreading
out
his
hands
on
his
knees
do
you
mean
he
continued
children
stolen
who
stole
them
can
answer
that
question
who
was
it
made
such
an
indecent
fuss
this
morning
because
a
poor
fatherless
and
motherless
babe
cried
who
threatened
to
leave
if
that
same
poor
babe
was
sent
to
the
workhouse
answer
me
that
mr
martin
and
then
tell
me
if
you
know
nothing
of
the
fate
of
the
hapless
innocents
mr
martin
looked
cautiously
round
at
the
door
which
was
slightly
ajar
he
got
up
softly
and
shut
it
then
he
advanced
gently
across
the
room
and
came
up
close
to
mrs
potts
this
he
said
you
like
it
yourself
i
like
what
good
gracious
the
man
frightens
me
you
like
the
wailing
sounds
of
the
fatherless
and
motherless
baby
you
were
nearer
to
it
than
i
was
if
you
heard
it
last
night
and
felt
all
the
pity
you
now
express
you
had
a
good
opportunity
of
putting
it
to
the
test
by
going
and
lulling
the
unfortunate
babe
to
rest
a
woman
mission
too
i
have
always
understood
mrs
potts
turned
scarlet
i
do
what
you
describe
she
said
forget
yourself
mr
martin
fail
to
see
that
i
do
mrs
potts
it
strikes
me
that
it
is
rather
the
other
way
perhaps
you
will
do
me
the
kindness
to
let
me
have
my
room
in
peace
mrs
potts
made
a
sweeping
curtsey
and
vanished
and
mr
martin
stood
for
some
time
in
his
deserted
parlour
feeling
far
more
uncomfortable
than
he
liked
to
confess
he
was
methodical
and
fussy
but
he
was
by
no
means
an
man
he
thought
mrs
potts
most
impertinent
but
her
news
distressed
him
after
reflecting
for
a
few
moments
he
went
across
to
the
fireplace
and
pulled
his
bell
sharply
after
a
short
pause
the
kitchen
slavey
answered
his
summons
her
eyes
were
red
with
weeping
and
her
nose
very
smutty
mr
martin
hated
dirty
servants
he
turned
his
back
to
her
as
he
spoke
is
your
mistress
in
sir
please
sir
we
all
distraught
with
grief
you
have
heard
of
the
the
have
heard
of
the
calamity
through
mrs
potts
can
i
speak
to
your
mistress
inquire
please
sir
missus
is
having
her
fourth
hysteric
fit
just
now
i
beg
mr
martin
face
grew
quite
white
beg
you
wo
disturb
her
until
she
is
equal
to
seeing
me
awful
if
the
fifth
comes
on
in
this
room
he
mentally
thought
a
good
mind
to
tell
her
not
to
disturb
herself
but
jane
had
vanished
in
about
a
quarter
of
an
hour
mrs
franklin
appeared
she
was
pale
but
her
grief
was
temperate
she
said
am
in
very
great
distress
the
children
peter
and
flossy
have
evidently
run
away
with
that
poor
baby
flossy
was
in
the
room
when
you
spoke
to
me
this
morning
mr
martin
and
she
must
have
taken
fright
at
your
words
the
children
took
the
opportunity
to
leave
the
house
when
i
was
out
marketing
your
steak
is
being
cooked
mr
martin
i
must
apologise
for
the
delay
i
beg
you
wo
mention
it
i
am
deeply
grieved
that
this
should
have
happened
and
that
i
am
the
cause
i
am
more
grieved
than
i
can
possibly
express
i
would
rather
lie
awake
all
night
listening
to
those
yells
of
that
miserable
infant
than
that
this
this
should
have
happened
the
alarm
the
upsetting
of
the
household
routine
the
inroad
into
my
sanctum
of
that
awful
female
h
of
your
lodger
and
last
but
not
least
the
danger
to
three
innocent
human
creatures
i
am
overpowered
with
remorse
at
the
sorry
part
i
have
played
myself
mention
it
mr
martin
i
always
said
there
be
trouble
when
the
baby
was
brought
it
ca
be
helped
now
of
course
we
must
keep
it
but
i
sorry
to
lose
a
valuable
and
considerate
lodger
like
yourself
sir
are
any
steps
being
taken
to
recover
the
children
husband
has
gone
to
the
nearest
sir
poor
mites
and
flossy
not
so
strong
in
her
chest
they
safe
to
be
back
by
mr
martin
and
perhaps
you
like
some
one
to
help
you
with
your
packing
sir
i
consider
it
said
mr
martin
i
not
such
a
young
man
as
i
was
mrs
franklin
i
sure
sir
well
we
none
of
us
that
are
we
i
should
take
you
sir
begging
your
pardon
to
be
but
a
very
little
way
on
the
wrong
side
of
forty
mr
martin
chuckled
and
then
grew
grave
the
wrong
side
of
sixty
he
said
now
no
humbugging
i
beg
sir
about
the
packing
my
head
is
all
in
a
muddle
it
is
true
but
any
help
that
i
can
give
do
you
say
to
a
baize
door
replied
mr
martin
rather
irrelevantly
i
beg
your
pardon
sir
a
very
thick
curtain
inside
my
room
door
it
is
true
i
have
heard
it
remarked
that
the
wails
of
an
infant
when
teething
will
penetrate
through
any
obstacles
still
a
baize
door
inside
your
nursery
door
and
thick
curtains
inside
mine
would
soften
the
disturbance
yes
would
soften
it
i
was
going
to
say
that
i
would
provide
them
you
will
stay
after
all
sir
well
do
you
agree
with
me
do
you
think
my
plan
will
make
matters
easier
wo
they
just
said
mrs
franklin
tears
now
brimming
over
in
her
eyes
a
good
man
mr
martin
and
god
will
bless
you
sir
said
flossy
when
at
last
she
got
home
all
right
about
dickory
we
took
her
to
the
lady
what
cried
mrs
franklin
had
flossy
in
her
arms
when
she
made
this
remark
now
she
pressed
her
close
with
one
arm
and
with
the
other
drew
peter
to
her
side
me
the
whole
story
my
darlings
she
said
which
they
did
mr
martin
himself
coming
into
the
kitchen
and
listening
to
them
i
know
mrs
ross
he
said
suddenly
a
splendid
chance
for
the
infant
a
splendid
chance
miles
better
than
a
baize

however
in

even

when
next
the

saw
dickory
she
was
beautifully
dressed
she

a
grand
