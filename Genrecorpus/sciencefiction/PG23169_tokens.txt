the
diamond
lens
by
i
from
a
very
early
period
of
my
life
the
entire
bent
of
my
inclinations
had
been
toward
microscopic
investigations
when
i
was
not
more
than
ten
years
old
a
distant
relative
of
our
family
hoping
to
astonish
my
inexperience
constructed
a
simple
microscope
for
me
by
drilling
in
a
disk
of
copper
a
small
hole
in
which
a
drop
of
pure
water
was
sustained
by
capillary
attraction
this
very
primitive
apparatus
magnifying
some
fifty
diameters
presented
it
is
true
only
indistinct
and
imperfect
forms
but
still
sufficiently
wonderful
to
work
up
my
imagination
to
a
preternatural
state
of
excitement
seeing
me
so
interested
in
this
rude
instrument
my
cousin
explained
to
me
all
that
he
knew
about
the
principles
of
the
microscope
related
to
me
a
few
of
the
wonders
which
had
been
accomplished
through
its
agency
and
ended
by
promising
to
send
me
one
regularly
constructed
immediately
on
his
return
to
the
city
i
counted
the
days
the
hours
the
minutes
that
intervened
between
that
promise
and
his
departure
meantime
i
was
not
idle
every
transparent
substance
that
bore
the
remotest
resemblance
to
a
lens
i
eagerly
seized
upon
and
employed
in
vain
attempts
to
realize
that
instrument
the
theory
of
whose
construction
i
as
yet
only
vaguely
comprehended
all
panes
of
glass
containing
those
oblate
spheroidal
knots
familiarly
known
as
were
ruthlessly
destroyed
in
the
hope
of
obtaining
lenses
of
marvelous
power
i
even
went
so
far
as
to
extract
the
crystalline
humor
from
the
eyes
of
fishes
and
animals
and
endeavored
to
press
it
into
the
microscopic
service
i
plead
guilty
to
having
stolen
the
glasses
from
my
aunt
agatha
spectacles
with
a
dim
idea
of
grinding
them
into
lenses
of
wondrous
magnifying
properties
in
which
attempt
it
is
scarcely
necessary
to
say
that
i
totally
failed
at
last
the
promised
instrument
came
it
was
of
that
order
known
as
field
simple
microscope
and
had
cost
perhaps
about
fifteen
dollars
as
far
as
educational
purposes
went
a
better
apparatus
could
not
have
been
selected
accompanying
it
was
a
small
treatise
on
the
microscope
its
history
uses
and
discoveries
i
comprehended
then
for
the
first
time
the
arabian
nights
entertainments
the
dull
veil
of
ordinary
existence
that
hung
across
the
world
seemed
suddenly
to
roll
away
and
to
lay
bare
a
land
of
enchantments
i
felt
toward
my
companions
as
the
seer
might
feel
toward
the
ordinary
masses
of
men
i
held
conversations
with
nature
in
a
tongue
which
they
could
not
understand
i
was
in
daily
communication
with
living
wonders
such
as
they
never
imagined
in
their
wildest
visions
i
penetrated
beyond
the
external
portal
of
things
and
roamed
through
the
sanctuaries
where
they
beheld
only
a
drop
of
rain
slowly
rolling
down
the
i
saw
a
universe
of
beings
animated
with
all
the
passions
common
to
physical
life
and
convulsing
their
minute
sphere
with
struggles
as
fierce
and
protracted
as
those
of
men
in
the
common
spots
of
mould
which
my
mother
good
housekeeper
that
she
was
fiercely
scooped
away
from
her
there
abode
for
me
under
the
name
of
mildew
enchanted
gardens
filled
with
dells
and
avenues
of
the
densest
foliage
and
most
astonishing
verdure
while
from
the
fantastic
boughs
of
these
microscopic
forests
hung
strange
fruits
glittering
with
green
and
silver
and
gold
it
was
no
scientific
thirst
that
at
this
time
filled
my
mind
it
was
the
pure
enjoyment
of
a
poet
to
whom
a
world
of
wonders
has
been
disclosed
i
talked
of
my
solitary
pleasures
to
none
alone
with
my
microscope
i
dimmed
my
sight
day
after
day
and
night
after
night
poring
over
the
marvels
which
it
unfolded
to
me
i
was
like
one
who
having
discovered
the
ancient
eden
still
existing
in
all
its
primitive
glory
should
resolve
to
enjoy
it
in
solitude
and
never
betray
to
mortal
the
secret
of
its
locality
the
rod
of
my
life
was
bent
at
this
moment
i
destined
myself
to
be
a
microscopist
of
course
like
every
novice
i
fancied
myself
a
discoverer
i
was
ignorant
at
the
time
of
the
thousands
of
acute
intellects
engaged
in
the
same
pursuit
as
myself
and
with
the
advantage
of
instruments
a
thousand
times
more
powerful
than
mine
the
names
of
leeuwenhoek
williamson
spencer
ehrenberg
schultz
dujardin
schact
and
schleiden
were
then
entirely
unknown
to
me
or
if
known
i
was
ignorant
of
their
patient
and
wonderful
researches
in
every
fresh
specimen
of
cryptogamia
which
i
placed
beneath
my
instrument
i
believed
that
i
discovered
wonders
of
which
the
world
was
as
yet
ignorant
i
remember
well
the
thrill
of
delight
and
admiration
that
shot
through
me
the
first
time
that
i
discovered
the
common
wheel
animalcule
rotifera
vulgaris
expanding
and
contracting
its
flexible
spokes
and
seemingly
rotating
through
the
water
alas
as
i
grew
older
and
obtained
some
works
treating
of
my
favorite
study
i
found
that
i
was
only
on
the
threshold
of
a
science
to
the
investigation
of
which
some
of
the
greatest
men
of
the
age
were
devoting
their
lives
and
intellects
as
i
grew
up
my
parents
who
saw
but
little
likelihood
of
anything
practical
resulting
from
the
examination
of
bits
of
moss
and
drops
of
water
through
a
brass
tube
and
a
piece
of
glass
were
anxious
that
i
should
choose
a
profession
it
was
their
desire
that
i
should
enter
the
of
my
uncle
ethan
blake
a
prosperous
merchant
who
carried
on
business
in
new
york
this
suggestion
i
decisively
combated
i
had
no
taste
for
trade
i
should
only
make
a
failure
in
short
i
refused
to
become
a
merchant
but
it
was
necessary
for
me
to
select
some
pursuit
my
parents
were
staid
new
england
people
who
insisted
on
the
necessity
of
labor
and
therefore
although
thanks
to
the
bequest
of
my
poor
aunt
agatha
i
should
on
coming
of
age
inherit
a
small
fortune
sufficient
to
place
me
above
want
it
was
decided
that
instead
of
waiting
for
this
i
should
act
the
nobler
part
and
employ
the
intervening
years
in
rendering
myself
independent
after
much
cogitation
i
complied
with
the
wishes
of
my
family
and
selected
a
profession
i
determined
to
study
medicine
at
the
new
york
academy
this
disposition
of
my
future
suited
me
a
removal
from
my
relatives
would
enable
me
to
dispose
of
my
time
as
i
pleased
without
fear
of
detection
as
long
as
i
paid
my
academy
fees
i
might
shirk
attending
the
lectures
if
i
chose
and
as
i
never
had
the
remotest
intention
of
standing
an
examination
there
was
no
danger
of
my
being
plucked
besides
a
metropolis
was
the
place
for
me
there
i
could
obtain
excellent
instruments
the
newest
publications
intimacy
with
men
of
pursuits
kindred
with
my
own
in
short
all
things
necessary
to
ensure
a
profitable
devotion
of
my
life
to
my
beloved
science
i
had
an
abundance
of
money
few
desires
that
were
not
bounded
by
my
illuminating
mirror
on
one
side
and
my
on
the
other
what
therefore
was
to
prevent
my
becoming
an
illustrious
investigator
of
the
veiled
worlds
it
was
with
the
most
buoyant
hope
that
i
left
my
new
england
home
and
established
myself
in
new
york
ii
my
first
step
of
course
was
to
find
suitable
apartments
these
i
obtained
after
a
couple
of
days
search
in
fourth
avenue
a
very
pretty
second
floor
unfurnished
containing
bedroom
and
a
smaller
apartment
which
i
intended
to
fit
up
as
a
laboratory
i
furnished
my
lodgings
simply
but
rather
elegantly
and
then
devoted
all
my
energies
to
the
adornment
of
the
temple
of
my
worship
i
visited
pike
the
celebrated
optician
and
passed
in
review
his
splendid
collection
of
microscopes
field
compound
hingham
spencer
nachet
binocular
that
founded
on
the
principles
of
the
stereoscope
and
at
length
fixed
upon
that
form
known
as
spencer
trunnion
microscope
as
combining
the
greatest
number
of
improvements
with
an
almost
perfect
freedom
from
tremor
along
with
this
i
purchased
every
possible
accessory
micrometers
a
achromatic
condensers
white
cloud
illuminators
prisms
parabolic
condensers
polarizing
apparatus
forceps
aquatic
boxes
with
a
host
of
other
articles
all
of
which
would
have
been
useful
in
the
hands
of
an
experienced
microscopist
but
as
i
afterward
discovered
were
not
of
the
slightest
present
value
to
me
it
takes
years
of
practice
to
know
how
to
use
a
complicated
microscope
the
optician
looked
suspiciously
at
me
as
i
made
these
valuable
purchases
he
evidently
was
uncertain
whether
to
set
me
down
as
some
scientific
celebrity
or
a
madman
i
think
he
was
inclined
to
the
latter
belief
i
suppose
i
was
mad
every
great
genius
is
mad
upon
the
subject
in
which
he
is
greatest
the
unsuccessful
madman
is
disgraced
and
called
a
lunatic
mad
or
not
i
set
myself
to
work
with
a
zeal
which
few
scientific
students
have
ever
equaled
i
had
everything
to
learn
relative
to
the
delicate
study
upon
which
i
had
embarked
a
study
involving
the
most
earnest
patience
the
most
rigid
analytic
powers
the
steadiest
hand
the
most
untiring
eye
the
most
refined
and
subtle
manipulation
for
a
long
time
half
my
apparatus
lay
inactively
on
the
shelves
of
my
laboratory
which
was
now
most
amply
furnished
with
every
possible
contrivance
for
facilitating
my
investigations
the
fact
was
that
i
did
not
know
how
to
use
some
of
my
scientific
implements
never
having
been
taught
microscopies
and
those
whose
use
i
understood
theoretically
were
of
little
avail
until
by
practice
i
could
attain
the
necessary
delicacy
of
handling
still
such
was
the
fury
of
my
ambition
such
the
untiring
perseverance
of
my
experiments
that
difficult
of
credit
as
it
may
be
in
the
course
of
one
year
i
became
theoretically
and
practically
an
accomplished
microscopist
during
this
period
of
my
labors
in
which
i
submitted
specimens
of
every
substance
that
came
under
my
observation
to
the
action
of
my
lenses
i
became
a
discoverer
in
a
small
way
it
is
true
for
i
was
very
young
but
still
a
discoverer
it
was
i
who
destroyed
ehrenberg
theory
that
the
was
an
animal
and
proved
that
his
monads
with
stomachs
and
eyes
were
merely
phases
of
the
formation
of
a
vegetable
cell
and
were
when
they
reached
their
mature
state
incapable
of
the
act
of
conjugation
or
any
true
generative
act
without
which
no
organism
rising
to
any
stage
of
life
higher
than
vegetable
can
be
said
to
be
complete
it
was
i
who
resolved
the
singular
problem
of
rotation
in
the
cells
and
hairs
of
plants
into
ciliary
attraction
in
spite
of
the
assertions
of
wenham
and
others
that
my
explanation
was
the
result
of
an
optical
illusion
but
notwithstanding
these
discoveries
laboriously
and
painfully
made
as
they
were
i
felt
horribly
dissatisfied
at
every
step
i
found
myself
stopped
by
the
imperfections
of
my
instruments
like
all
active
microscopists
i
gave
my
imagination
full
play
indeed
it
is
a
common
complaint
against
many
such
that
they
supply
the
defects
of
their
instruments
with
the
creations
of
their
brains
i
imagined
depths
beyond
depths
in
nature
which
the
limited
power
of
my
lenses
prohibited
me
from
exploring
i
lay
awake
at
night
constructing
imaginary
of
immeasurable
power
with
which
i
seemed
to
pierce
through
all
the
envelopes
of
matter
down
to
its
original
atom
how
i
cursed
those
imperfect
mediums
which
necessity
through
ignorance
compelled
me
to
use
how
i
longed
to
discover
the
secret
of
some
perfect
lens
whose
magnifying
power
should
be
limited
only
by
the
resolvability
of
the
object
and
which
at
the
same
time
should
be
free
from
spherical
and
chromatic
aberrations
in
short
from
all
the
obstacles
over
which
the
poor
microscopist
finds
himself
continually
stumbling
i
felt
convinced
that
the
simple
microscope
composed
of
a
single
lens
of
such
vast
yet
perfect
power
was
possible
of
construction
to
attempt
to
bring
the
compound
microscope
up
to
such
a
pitch
would
have
been
commencing
at
the
wrong
end
this
latter
being
simply
a
partially
successful
endeavor
to
remedy
those
very
defects
of
the
simplest
instrument
which
if
conquered
would
leave
nothing
to
be
desired
it
was
in
this
mood
of
mind
that
i
became
a
constructive
microscopist
after
another
year
passed
in
this
new
pursuit
experimenting
on
every
imaginable
substance
glass
gems
flints
crystals
artificial
crystals
formed
of
the
alloy
of
various
vitreous
materials
in
short
having
constructed
as
many
varieties
of
lenses
as
argus
had
eyes
i
found
myself
precisely
where
i
started
with
nothing
gained
save
an
extensive
knowledge
of
i
was
almost
dead
with
despair
my
parents
were
surprised
at
my
apparent
want
of
progress
in
my
medical
studies
i
had
not
attended
one
lecture
since
my
arrival
in
the
city
and
the
expenses
of
my
mad
pursuit
had
been
so
great
as
to
embarrass
me
very
seriously
i
was
in
this
frame
of
mind
one
day
experimenting
in
my
laboratory
on
a
small
diamond
that
stone
from
its
great
refracting
power
having
always
occupied
my
attention
more
than
any
other
when
a
young
frenchman
who
lived
on
the
floor
above
me
and
who
was
in
the
habit
of
occasionally
visiting
me
entered
the
room
i
think
that
jules
simon
was
a
jew
he
had
many
traits
of
the
hebrew
character
a
love
of
jewelry
of
dress
and
of
good
living
there
was
something
mysterious
about
him
he
always
had
something
to
sell
and
yet
went
into
excellent
society
when
i
say
sell
i
should
perhaps
have
said
peddle
for
his
operations
were
generally
confined
to
the
disposal
of
single
articles
a
picture
for
instance
or
a
rare
carving
in
ivory
or
a
pair
of
or
the
dress
of
a
mexican
when
i
was
first
furnishing
my
rooms
he
paid
me
a
visit
which
ended
in
my
purchasing
an
antique
silver
lamp
which
he
assured
me
was
a
cellini
it
was
handsome
enough
even
for
that
and
some
other
for
my
why
simon
should
pursue
this
petty
trade
i
never
could
imagine
he
apparently
had
plenty
of
money
and
had
the
of
the
best
houses
in
the
city
taking
care
however
i
suppose
to
drive
no
bargains
within
the
enchanted
circle
of
the
upper
ten
i
came
at
length
to
the
conclusion
that
this
peddling
was
but
a
mask
to
cover
some
greater
object
and
even
went
so
far
as
to
believe
my
young
acquaintance
to
be
implicated
in
the
that
however
was
none
of
my
affair
on
the
present
occasion
simon
entered
my
room
in
a
state
of
considerable
excitement
mon
ami
he
cried
before
i
could
even
offer
him
the
ordinary
salutation
it
has
occurred
to
me
to
be
the
witness
of
the
most
astonishing
things
in
the
world
i
promenade
myself
to
the
house
of
madame
how
does
the
little
animal
name
himself
in
the
latin
vulpes
i
answered
ah
yes
vulpes
i
promenade
myself
to
the
house
of
madame
vulpes
the
spirit
medium
yes
the
great
medium
great
heavens
what
a
woman
i
write
on
a
slip
of
paper
many
of
questions
concerning
affairs
of
the
most
secret
affairs
that
conceal
themselves
in
the
abysses
of
my
heart
the
most
profound
and
behold
by
example
what
occurs
this
devil
of
a
woman
makes
me
replies
the
most
truthful
to
all
of
them
she
talks
to
me
of
things
that
i
do
not
love
to
talk
of
to
myself
what
am
i
to
think
i
am
fixed
to
the
earth
am
i
to
understand
you
simon
that
this
vulpes
replied
to
questions
secretly
written
by
you
which
questions
related
to
events
known
only
to
yourself
ah
more
than
that
more
than
that
he
answered
with
an
air
of
some
alarm
she
related
to
me
things
but
he
added
after
a
pause
and
suddenly
changing
his
manner
why
occupy
ourselves
with
these
follies
it
was
all
the
biology
without
doubt
it
goes
without
saying
that
it
has
not
my
credence
but
why
are
we
here
ami
it
has
occurred
to
me
to
discover
the
most
beautiful
thing
as
you
can
imagine
a
vase
with
green
lizards
on
it
composed
by
the
great
bernard
palissy
it
is
in
my
apartment
let
us
mount
i
go
to
show
it
to
you
i
followed
simon
mechanically
but
my
thoughts
were
far
from
palissy
and
his
enameled
ware
although
i
like
him
was
seeking
in
the
dark
a
great
discovery
this
casual
mention
of
the
spiritualist
madame
vulpes
set
me
on
a
new
track
what
if
through
communication
with
more
subtle
organisms
than
my
own
i
could
reach
at
a
single
bound
the
goal
which
perhaps
a
life
of
agonizing
mental
toil
would
never
enable
me
to
attain
while
purchasing
the
palissy
vase
from
my
friend
simon
i
was
mentally
arranging
a
visit
to
madame
vulpes
iii
two
evenings
after
this
thanks
to
an
arrangement
by
letter
and
the
promise
of
an
ample
fee
i
found
madame
vulpes
awaiting
me
at
her
residence
alone
she
was
a
woman
with
keen
and
rather
cruel
dark
eyes
and
an
exceedingly
sensual
expression
about
her
mouth
and
under
jaw
she
received
me
in
perfect
silence
in
an
apartment
on
the
ground
floor
very
sparsely
furnished
in
the
centre
of
the
room
close
to
where
vulpes
sat
there
was
a
common
round
mahogany
table
if
i
had
come
for
the
purpose
of
sweeping
her
chimney
the
woman
could
not
have
looked
more
indifferent
to
my
appearance
there
was
no
attempt
to
inspire
the
visitor
with
awe
everything
bore
a
simple
and
practical
aspect
this
intercourse
with
the
spiritual
world
was
evidently
as
familiar
an
occupation
with
vulpes
as
eating
her
dinner
or
riding
in
an
omnibus
you
come
for
a
communication
mr
linley
said
the
medium
in
a
dry
businesslike
tone
of
voice
by
appointment
yes
what
sort
of
communication
do
you
want
a
written
one
yes
i
wish
for
a
written
one
from
any
particular
spirit
yes
have
you
ever
known
this
spirit
on
this
earth
never
he
died
long
before
i
was
born
i
wish
merely
to
obtain
from
him
some
information
which
he
ought
to
be
able
to
give
better
than
any
other
will
you
seat
yourself
at
the
table
said
the
medium
and
place
your
hands
upon
it
i
obeyed
vulpes
being
seated
opposite
to
me
with
her
hands
also
on
the
table
we
remained
thus
for
about
a
minute
and
a
half
when
a
violent
succession
of
raps
came
on
the
table
on
the
back
of
my
chair
on
the
floor
immediately
under
my
feet
and
even
on
the
vulpes
smiled
composedly
they
are
very
strong
she
remarked
you
are
fortunate
she
then
continued
will
the
spirits
communicate
with
this
gentleman
vigorous
affirmative
will
the
particular
spirit
he
desires
to
speak
with
communicate
a
very
confused
rapping
followed
this
question
i
know
what
they
mean
said
vulpes
addressing
herself
to
me
they
wish
you
to
write
down
the
name
of
the
particular
spirit
that
you
desire
to
converse
with
is
that
so
she
added
speaking
to
her
invisible
guests
that
it
was
so
was
evident
from
the
numerous
affirmatory
responses
while
this
was
going
on
i
tore
a
slip
from
my
and
scribbled
a
name
under
the
table
will
this
spirit
communicate
in
writing
with
this
gentleman
asked
the
medium
once
more
after
a
moment
pause
her
hand
seemed
to
be
seized
with
a
violent
tremor
shaking
so
forcibly
that
the
table
vibrated
she
said
that
a
spirit
had
seized
her
hand
and
would
write
i
handed
her
some
sheets
of
paper
that
were
on
the
table
and
a
pencil
the
latter
she
held
loosely
in
her
hand
which
presently
began
to
move
over
the
paper
with
a
singular
and
seemingly
involuntary
motion
after
a
few
moments
had
elapsed
she
handed
me
the
paper
on
which
i
found
written
in
a
large
uncultivated
hand
the
words
he
is
not
here
but
has
been
sent
for
a
pause
of
a
minute
or
so
ensued
during
which
vulpes
remained
perfectly
silent
but
the
raps
continued
at
regular
intervals
when
the
short
period
i
mention
had
elapsed
the
hand
of
the
medium
was
again
seized
with
its
convulsive
tremor
and
she
wrote
under
this
strange
influence
a
few
words
on
the
paper
which
she
handed
to
me
they
were
as
follows
i
am
here
question
me
i
was
astounded
the
name
was
identical
with
that
i
had
written
beneath
the
table
and
carefully
kept
concealed
neither
was
it
at
all
probable
that
an
uncultivated
woman
like
vulpes
should
know
even
the
name
of
the
great
father
of
microscopies
it
may
have
been
biology
but
this
theory
was
soon
doomed
to
be
destroyed
i
wrote
on
my
slip
still
concealing
it
from
vulpes
a
series
of
questions
which
to
avoid
tediousness
i
shall
place
with
the
responses
in
the
order
in
which
they
occurred
can
the
microscope
be
brought
to
perfection
spirit
yes
am
i
destined
to
accomplish
this
great
task
you
are
i
wish
to
know
how
to
proceed
to
attain
this
end
for
the
love
which
you
bear
to
science
help
me
spirit
a
diamond
of
one
hundred
and
forty
carats
submitted
to
currents
for
a
long
period
will
experience
a
rearrangement
of
its
atoms
and
from
that
stone
you
will
form
the
universal
lens
will
great
discoveries
result
from
the
use
of
such
a
lens
spirit
so
great
that
all
that
has
gone
before
is
as
nothing
but
the
refractive
power
of
the
diamond
is
so
immense
that
the
image
will
be
formed
within
the
lens
how
is
that
difficulty
to
be
surmounted
spirit
pierce
the
lens
through
its
axis
and
the
difficulty
is
obviated
the
image
will
be
formed
in
the
pierced
space
which
will
itself
serve
as
a
tube
to
look
through
now
i
am
called
i
can
not
at
all
describe
the
effect
that
these
extraordinary
communications
had
upon
me
i
felt
completely
bewildered
no
biological
theory
could
account
for
the
of
the
lens
the
medium
might
by
means
of
biological
with
my
mind
have
gone
so
far
as
to
read
my
questions
and
reply
to
them
coherently
but
biology
could
not
enable
her
to
discover
that
magnetic
currents
would
so
alter
the
crystals
of
the
diamond
as
to
remedy
its
previous
defects
and
admit
of
its
being
polished
into
a
perfect
lens
some
such
theory
may
have
passed
through
my
head
it
is
true
but
if
so
i
had
forgotten
it
in
my
excited
condition
of
mind
there
was
no
course
left
but
to
become
a
convert
and
it
was
in
a
state
of
the
most
painful
nervous
exaltation
that
i
left
the
medium
house
that
evening
she
accompanied
me
to
the
door
hoping
that
i
was
satisfied
the
raps
followed
us
as
we
went
through
the
hall
sounding
on
the
balusters
the
flooring
and
even
the
lintels
of
the
door
i
hastily
expressed
my
satisfaction
and
escaped
hurriedly
into
the
cool
night
air
i
walked
home
with
but
one
thought
possessing
me
how
to
obtain
a
diamond
of
the
immense
size
required
my
entire
means
multiplied
a
hundred
times
over
would
have
been
inadequate
to
its
purchase
besides
such
stones
are
rare
and
become
historical
i
could
find
such
only
in
the
regalia
of
eastern
or
european
monarchs
iv
there
was
a
light
in
simon
room
as
i
entered
my
house
a
vague
impulse
urged
me
to
visit
him
as
i
opened
the
door
of
his
unannounced
he
was
bending
with
his
back
toward
me
over
a
carcel
lamp
apparently
engaged
in
minutely
examining
some
object
which
he
held
in
his
hands
as
i
entered
he
started
suddenly
thrust
his
hand
into
his
breast
pocket
and
turned
to
me
with
a
face
crimson
with
confusion
what
i
cried
poring
over
the
miniature
of
some
fair
lady
well
do
blush
so
much
i
wo
ask
to
see
it
simon
laughed
awkwardly
enough
but
made
none
of
the
negative
protestations
usual
on
such
occasions
he
asked
me
to
take
a
seat
simon
said
i
i
have
just
come
from
madame
vulpes
this
time
simon
turned
as
white
as
a
sheet
and
seemed
stupefied
as
if
a
sudden
electric
shock
had
smitten
him
he
babbled
some
incoherent
words
and
went
hastily
to
a
small
closet
where
he
usually
kept
his
liquors
although
astonished
at
his
emotion
i
was
too
preoccupied
with
my
own
idea
to
pay
much
attention
to
anything
else
you
say
truly
when
you
call
madame
vulpes
a
devil
of
a
woman
i
continued
simon
she
told
me
wonderful
things
or
rather
was
the
means
of
telling
me
wonderful
things
ah
if
i
could
only
get
a
diamond
that
weighed
one
hundred
and
forty
carats
scarcely
had
the
sigh
with
which
i
uttered
this
desire
died
upon
my
lips
when
simon
with
the
aspect
of
a
wild
beast
glared
at
me
savagely
and
rushing
to
the
mantelpiece
where
some
foreign
weapons
hung
on
the
wall
caught
up
a
malay
creese
and
brandished
it
furiously
before
him
no
he
cried
in
french
into
which
he
always
broke
when
excited
no
you
shall
not
have
it
you
are
perfidious
you
have
consulted
with
that
demon
and
desire
my
treasure
but
i
will
die
first
me
i
am
brave
you
can
not
make
me
fear
all
this
uttered
in
a
loud
voice
trembling
with
excitement
astounded
me
i
saw
at
a
glance
that
i
had
accidentally
trodden
upon
the
edges
of
simon
secret
whatever
it
was
it
was
necessary
to
reassure
him
my
dear
simon
i
said
i
am
entirely
at
a
loss
to
know
what
you
mean
i
went
to
madame
vulpes
to
consult
with
her
on
a
scientific
problem
to
the
solution
of
which
i
discovered
that
a
diamond
of
the
size
i
just
mentioned
was
necessary
you
were
never
alluded
to
during
the
evening
nor
so
far
as
i
was
concerned
even
thought
of
what
can
be
the
meaning
of
this
outburst
if
you
happen
to
have
a
set
of
valuable
diamonds
in
your
possession
you
need
fear
nothing
from
me
the
diamond
which
i
require
you
could
not
possess
or
if
you
did
possess
it
you
would
not
be
living
here
something
in
my
tone
must
have
completely
reassured
him
for
his
expression
immediately
changed
to
a
sort
of
constrained
merriment
combined
however
with
a
certain
suspicious
attention
to
my
movements
he
laughed
and
said
that
i
must
bear
with
him
that
he
was
at
certain
moments
subject
to
a
species
of
vertigo
which
betrayed
itself
in
incoherent
speeches
and
that
the
attacks
passed
off
as
rapidly
as
they
came
he
put
his
weapon
aside
while
making
this
explanation
and
endeavored
with
some
success
to
assume
a
more
cheerful
air
all
this
did
not
impose
on
me
in
the
least
i
was
too
much
accustomed
to
analytical
labors
to
be
baffled
by
so
flimsy
a
veil
i
determined
to
probe
the
mystery
to
the
bottom
simon
i
said
gayly
let
us
forget
all
this
over
a
bottle
of
burgundy
i
have
a
case
of
lausseure
downstairs
fragrant
with
the
odors
and
ruddy
with
the
sunlight
of
the
côte
let
us
have
up
a
couple
of
bottles
what
say
you
with
all
my
heart
answered
simon
smilingly
i
produced
the
wine
and
we
seated
ourselves
to
drink
it
was
of
a
famous
vintage
that
of
a
year
when
war
and
wine
throve
together
and
its
pure
but
powerful
juice
seemed
to
impart
renewed
vitality
to
the
system
by
the
time
we
had
half
finished
the
second
bottle
simon
head
which
i
knew
was
a
weak
one
had
begun
to
yield
while
i
remained
calm
as
ever
only
that
every
draught
seemed
to
send
a
flush
of
vigor
through
my
limbs
simon
utterance
became
more
and
more
indistinct
he
took
to
singing
french
of
a
not
very
moral
tendency
i
rose
suddenly
from
the
table
just
at
the
conclusion
of
one
of
those
incoherent
verses
and
fixing
my
eyes
on
him
with
a
quiet
smile
said
simon
i
have
deceived
you
i
learned
your
secret
this
evening
you
may
as
well
be
frank
with
me
vulpes
or
rather
one
of
her
spirits
told
me
all
he
started
with
horror
his
intoxication
seemed
for
the
moment
to
fade
away
and
he
made
a
movement
toward
the
weapon
that
he
had
a
short
time
before
laid
down
i
stopped
him
with
my
hand
monster
he
cried
passionately
i
am
ruined
what
shall
i
do
you
shall
never
have
it
i
swear
by
my
mother
i
do
want
it
i
said
rest
secure
but
be
frank
with
me
tell
me
all
about
it
the
drunkenness
began
to
return
he
protested
with
maudlin
earnestness
that
i
was
entirely
mistaken
that
i
was
intoxicated
then
asked
me
to
swear
eternal
secrecy
and
promised
to
disclose
the
mystery
to
me
i
pledged
myself
of
course
to
all
with
an
uneasy
look
in
his
eyes
and
hands
unsteady
with
drink
and
nervousness
he
drew
a
small
case
from
his
breast
and
opened
it
heavens
how
the
mild
lamplight
was
shivered
into
a
thousand
prismatic
arrows
as
it
fell
upon
a
vast
that
glittered
in
the
case
i
was
no
judge
of
diamonds
but
i
saw
at
a
glance
that
this
was
a
gem
of
rare
size
and
purity
i
looked
at
simon
with
wonder
and
must
i
confess
it
with
envy
how
could
he
have
obtained
this
treasure
in
reply
to
my
questions
i
could
just
gather
from
his
drunken
statements
of
which
i
fancy
half
the
incoherence
was
affected
that
he
had
been
superintending
a
gang
of
slaves
engaged
in
in
brazil
that
he
had
seen
one
of
them
secrete
a
diamond
but
instead
of
informing
his
employers
had
quietly
watched
the
negro
until
he
saw
him
bury
his
treasure
that
he
had
dug
it
up
and
fled
with
it
but
that
as
yet
he
was
afraid
to
attempt
to
dispose
of
it
publicly
so
valuable
a
gem
being
almost
certain
to
attract
too
much
attention
to
its
owner
antecedents
and
he
had
not
been
able
to
discover
any
of
those
obscure
channels
by
which
such
matters
are
conveyed
away
safely
he
added
that
in
accordance
with
oriental
practice
he
had
named
his
diamond
with
the
fanciful
title
of
the
eye
of
morning
while
simon
was
relating
this
to
me
i
regarded
the
great
diamond
attentively
never
had
i
beheld
anything
so
beautiful
all
the
glories
of
light
ever
imagined
or
described
seemed
to
pulsate
in
its
crystalline
chambers
its
weight
as
i
learned
from
simon
was
exactly
one
hundred
and
forty
carats
here
was
an
amazing
coincidence
the
hand
of
destiny
seemed
in
it
on
the
very
evening
when
the
spirit
of
leeuwenhoek
communicates
to
me
the
great
secret
of
the
microscope
the
priceless
means
which
he
directs
me
to
employ
start
up
within
my
easy
reach
i
determined
with
the
most
perfect
deliberation
to
possess
myself
of
simon
diamond
i
sat
opposite
to
him
while
he
nodded
over
his
glass
and
calmly
revolved
the
whole
affair
i
did
not
for
an
instant
contemplate
so
foolish
an
act
as
a
common
theft
which
would
of
course
be
discovered
or
at
least
necessitate
flight
and
concealment
all
of
which
must
interfere
with
my
scientific
plans
there
was
but
one
step
to
be
taken
to
kill
simon
after
all
what
was
the
life
of
a
little
peddling
jew
in
comparison
with
the
interests
of
science
human
beings
are
taken
every
day
from
the
condemned
prisons
to
be
experimented
on
by
surgeons
this
man
simon
was
by
his
own
confession
a
criminal
a
robber
and
i
believed
on
my
soul
a
murderer
he
deserved
death
quite
as
much
as
any
felon
condemned
by
the
laws
why
should
i
not
like
government
contrive
that
his
punishment
should
contribute
to
the
progress
of
human
knowledge
the
means
for
accomplishing
everything
i
desired
lay
within
my
reach
there
stood
upon
the
mantelpiece
a
bottle
half
full
of
french
laudanum
simon
was
so
occupied
with
his
diamond
which
i
had
just
restored
to
him
that
it
was
an
affair
of
no
difficulty
to
drug
his
glass
in
a
quarter
of
an
hour
he
was
in
a
profound
sleep
i
now
opened
his
waistcoat
took
the
diamond
from
the
inner
pocket
in
which
he
had
placed
it
and
removed
him
to
the
bed
on
which
i
laid
him
so
that
his
feet
hung
down
over
the
edge
i
had
possessed
myself
of
the
malay
creese
which
i
held
in
my
right
hand
while
with
the
other
i
discovered
as
accurately
as
i
could
by
pulsation
the
exact
locality
of
the
heart
it
was
essential
that
all
the
aspects
of
his
death
should
lead
to
the
surmise
of
i
calculated
the
exact
angle
at
which
it
was
probable
that
the
weapon
if
leveled
by
simon
own
hand
would
enter
his
breast
then
with
one
powerful
blow
i
thrust
it
up
to
the
hilt
in
the
very
spot
which
i
desired
to
penetrate
a
convulsive
thrill
ran
through
simon
limbs
i
heard
a
smothered
sound
issue
from
his
throat
precisely
like
the
bursting
of
a
large
sent
up
by
a
diver
when
it
reaches
the
surface
of
the
water
he
turned
half
round
on
his
side
and
as
if
to
assist
my
plans
more
effectually
his
right
hand
moved
by
some
mere
spasmodic
impulse
clasped
the
handle
of
the
creese
which
it
remained
holding
with
extraordinary
muscular
tenacity
beyond
this
there
was
no
apparent
struggle
the
laudanum
i
presume
paralyzed
the
usual
nervous
action
he
must
have
died
instantly
there
was
yet
something
to
be
done
to
make
it
certain
that
all
suspicion
of
the
act
should
be
diverted
from
any
inhabitant
of
the
house
to
simon
himself
it
was
necessary
that
the
door
should
be
found
in
the
morning
on
the
how
to
do
this
and
afterward
escape
myself
not
by
the
window
that
was
a
physical
impossibility
besides
i
was
determined
that
the
windows
should
be
found
bolted
the
solution
was
simple
enough
i
descended
softly
to
my
own
room
for
a
peculiar
instrument
which
i
had
used
for
holding
small
slippery
substances
such
as
minute
spheres
of
glass
etc
this
instrument
was
nothing
more
than
a
long
slender
with
a
very
powerful
grip
and
a
considerable
leverage
which
last
was
accidentally
owing
to
the
shape
of
the
handle
nothing
was
simpler
than
when
the
key
was
in
the
lock
to
seize
the
end
of
its
stem
in
this
vise
through
the
keyhole
from
the
outside
and
so
lock
the
door
previously
however
to
doing
this
i
burned
a
number
of
papers
on
simon
hearth
suicides
almost
always
burn
papers
before
they
destroy
themselves
i
also
emptied
some
more
laudanum
into
simon
glass
having
first
removed
from
it
all
traces
of
wine
cleaned
the
other
and
brought
the
bottles
away
with
me
if
traces
of
two
persons
drinking
had
been
found
in
the
room
the
question
naturally
would
have
arisen
who
was
the
second
besides
the
might
have
been
identified
as
belonging
to
me
the
laudanum
i
poured
out
to
account
for
its
presence
in
his
stomach
in
case
of
a
examination
the
theory
naturally
would
be
that
he
first
intended
to
poison
himself
but
after
swallowing
a
little
of
the
drug
was
either
disgusted
with
its
taste
or
changed
his
mind
from
other
motives
and
chose
the
dagger
these
arrangements
made
i
walked
out
leaving
the
gas
burning
locked
the
door
with
my
vise
and
went
to
bed
simon
death
was
not
discovered
until
nearly
three
in
the
afternoon
the
servant
astonished
at
seeing
the
gas
burning
the
light
streaming
on
the
dark
landing
from
under
the
door
peeped
through
the
keyhole
and
saw
simon
on
the
bed
she
gave
the
alarm
the
door
was
burst
open
and
the
neighborhood
was
in
a
fever
of
excitement
every
one
in
the
house
was
arrested
myself
included
there
was
an
inquest
but
no
clew
to
his
death
beyond
that
of
suicide
could
be
obtained
curiously
enough
he
had
made
several
speeches
to
his
friends
the
preceding
week
that
seemed
to
point
to
one
gentleman
swore
that
simon
had
said
in
his
presence
that
he
was
tired
of
life
his
landlord
affirmed
that
simon
when
paying
him
his
last
month
rent
remarked
that
he
should
not
pay
him
rent
much
longer
all
the
other
evidence
corresponded
the
door
locked
inside
the
position
of
the
corpse
the
burned
papers
as
i
anticipated
no
one
knew
of
the
possession
of
the
diamond
by
simon
so
that
no
motive
was
suggested
for
his
murder
the
jury
after
a
prolonged
examination
brought
in
the
usual
verdict
and
the
neighborhood
once
more
settled
down
to
its
accustomed
quiet
v
the
three
months
succeeding
simon
catastrophe
i
devoted
night
and
day
to
my
diamond
lens
i
had
constructed
a
vast
galvanic
battery
composed
of
nearly
two
thousand
pairs
of
plates
a
higher
power
i
dared
not
use
lest
the
diamond
should
be
calcined
by
means
of
this
enormous
engine
i
was
enabled
to
send
a
powerful
current
of
electricity
continually
through
my
great
diamond
which
it
seemed
to
me
gained
in
lustre
every
day
at
the
expiration
of
a
month
i
commenced
the
grinding
and
polishing
of
the
lens
a
work
of
intense
toil
and
exquisite
delicacy
the
great
density
of
the
stone
and
the
care
required
to
be
taken
with
the
curvatures
of
the
surfaces
of
the
lens
rendered
the
labor
the
severest
and
most
harassing
that
i
had
yet
undergone
at
last
the
eventful
moment
came
the
lens
was
completed
i
stood
trembling
on
the
threshold
of
new
worlds
i
had
the
realization
of
alexander
famous
wish
before
me
the
lens
lay
on
the
table
ready
to
be
placed
upon
its
platform
my
hand
fairly
shook
as
i
enveloped
a
drop
of
water
with
a
thin
coating
of
oil
of
turpentine
preparatory
to
its
examination
a
process
necessary
in
order
to
prevent
the
rapid
evaporation
of
the
water
i
now
placed
the
drop
on
a
thin
slip
of
glass
under
the
lens
and
throwing
upon
it
by
the
combined
aid
of
a
prism
and
a
mirror
a
powerful
stream
of
light
i
approached
my
eye
to
the
minute
hole
drilled
through
the
axis
of
the
lens
for
an
instant
i
saw
nothing
save
what
seemed
to
be
an
illuminated
chaos
a
vast
luminous
abyss
a
pure
white
light
cloudless
and
serene
and
seemingly
limitless
as
space
itself
was
my
first
impression
gently
and
with
the
greatest
care
i
depressed
the
lens
a
few
hairbreadths
the
wondrous
illumination
still
continued
but
as
the
lens
approached
the
object
a
scene
of
indescribable
beauty
was
unfolded
to
my
view
i
seemed
to
gaze
upon
a
vast
space
the
limits
of
which
extended
far
beyond
my
vision
an
atmosphere
of
magical
luminousness
permeated
the
entire
field
of
view
i
was
amazed
to
see
no
trace
of
animalculous
life
not
a
living
thing
apparently
inhabited
that
dazzling
expanse
i
comprehended
instantly
that
by
the
wondrous
power
of
my
lens
i
had
penetrated
beyond
the
grosser
particles
of
aqueous
matter
beyond
the
realms
of
infusoria
and
protozoa
down
to
the
original
gaseous
globule
into
whose
luminous
interior
i
was
gazing
as
into
an
almost
boundless
dome
filled
with
a
supernatural
radiance
it
was
however
no
brilliant
void
into
which
i
looked
on
every
side
i
beheld
beautiful
inorganic
forms
of
unknown
texture
and
colored
with
the
most
enchanting
hues
these
forms
presented
the
appearance
of
what
might
be
called
for
want
of
a
more
specific
definition
foliated
clouds
of
the
highest
rarity
that
is
they
undulated
and
broke
into
vegetable
formations
and
were
tinged
with
splendors
compared
with
which
the
gilding
of
our
autumn
woodlands
is
as
dross
compared
with
gold
far
away
into
the
illimitable
distance
stretched
long
avenues
of
these
gaseous
forests
dimly
transparent
and
painted
with
prismatic
hues
of
unimaginable
brilliancy
the
pendent
branches
waved
along
the
fluid
glades
until
every
vista
seemed
to
break
through
ranks
of
drooping
silken
pennons
what
seemed
to
be
either
fruits
or
flowers
pied
with
a
thousand
hues
lustrous
and
bubbled
from
the
crowns
of
this
fairy
foliage
no
hills
no
lakes
no
rivers
no
forms
animate
or
inanimate
were
to
be
seen
save
those
vast
auroral
copses
that
floated
serenely
in
the
luminous
stillness
with
leaves
and
fruits
and
flowers
gleaming
with
unknown
fires
unrealizable
by
mere
imagination
how
strange
i
thought
that
this
sphere
should
be
thus
condemned
to
solitude
i
had
hoped
at
least
to
discover
some
new
form
of
animal
life
perhaps
of
a
lower
class
than
any
with
which
we
are
at
present
acquainted
but
still
some
living
organism
i
found
my
newly
discovered
world
if
i
may
so
speak
a
beautiful
chromatic
desert
while
i
was
speculating
on
the
singular
arrangements
of
the
internal
economy
of
nature
with
which
she
so
frequently
splinters
into
atoms
our
most
compact
theories
i
thought
i
beheld
a
form
moving
slowly
through
the
glades
of
one
of
the
prismatic
forests
i
looked
more
attentively
and
found
that
i
was
not
mistaken
words
can
not
depict
the
anxiety
with
which
i
awaited
the
nearer
approach
of
this
mysterious
object
was
it
merely
some
inanimate
substance
held
in
suspense
in
the
attenuated
atmosphere
of
the
globule
or
was
it
an
animal
endowed
with
vitality
and
motion
it
approached
flitting
behind
the
gauzy
colored
veils
of
for
seconds
dimly
revealed
then
vanishing
at
last
the
violet
pennons
that
trailed
nearest
to
me
vibrated
they
were
gently
pushed
aside
and
the
form
floated
out
into
the
broad
light
it
was
a
female
human
shape
when
i
say
human
i
mean
it
possessed
the
outlines
of
humanity
but
there
the
analogy
ends
its
adorable
beauty
lifted
it
illimitable
heights
beyond
the
loveliest
daughter
of
adam
i
can
not
i
dare
not
attempt
to
inventory
the
charms
of
this
divine
revelation
of
perfect
beauty
those
eyes
of
mystic
violet
dewy
and
serene
evade
my
words
her
long
lustrous
hair
following
her
glorious
head
in
a
golden
wake
like
the
track
sown
in
heaven
by
a
falling
star
seems
to
quench
my
most
burning
phrases
with
its
splendors
if
all
the
bees
of
hybla
nestled
upon
my
lips
they
would
still
sing
but
hoarsely
the
wondrous
harmonies
of
outline
that
inclosed
her
form
she
swept
out
from
between
the
of
the
into
the
broad
sea
of
light
that
lay
beyond
her
motions
were
those
of
some
graceful
naiad
cleaving
by
a
mere
effort
of
her
will
the
clear
unruffled
waters
that
fill
the
chambers
of
the
sea
she
floated
forth
with
the
serene
grace
of
a
frail
bubble
ascending
through
the
still
atmosphere
of
a
june
day
the
perfect
roundness
of
her
limbs
formed
suave
and
enchanting
curves
it
was
like
listening
to
the
most
spiritual
symphony
of
beethoven
the
divine
to
watch
the
harmonious
flow
of
lines
this
indeed
was
a
pleasure
cheaply
purchased
at
any
price
what
cared
i
if
i
had
waded
to
the
portal
of
this
wonder
through
another
blood
i
would
have
given
my
own
to
enjoy
one
such
moment
of
intoxication
and
delight
breathless
with
gazing
on
this
lovely
wonder
and
forgetful
for
an
instant
of
everything
save
her
presence
i
withdrew
my
eye
from
the
microscope
eagerly
alas
as
my
gaze
fell
on
the
thin
slide
that
lay
beneath
my
instrument
the
bright
light
from
mirror
and
from
prism
sparkled
on
a
colorless
drop
of
water
there
in
that
tiny
bead
of
dew
this
beautiful
being
was
forever
imprisoned
the
planet
neptune
was
not
more
distant
from
me
than
she
i
hastened
once
more
to
apply
my
eye
to
the
microscope
animula
let
me
now
call
her
by
that
dear
name
which
i
subsequently
bestowed
on
her
had
changed
her
position
she
had
again
approached
the
wondrous
forest
and
was
gazing
earnestly
upward
presently
one
of
the
trees
as
i
must
call
them
unfolded
a
long
ciliary
process
with
which
it
seized
one
of
the
gleaming
fruits
that
glittered
on
its
summit
and
sweeping
slowly
down
held
it
within
reach
of
animula
the
sylph
took
it
in
her
delicate
hand
and
began
to
eat
my
attention
was
so
entirely
absorbed
by
her
that
i
could
not
apply
myself
to
the
task
of
determining
whether
this
singular
plant
was
or
was
not
instinct
with
volition
i
watched
her
as
she
made
her
repast
with
the
most
profound
attention
the
suppleness
of
her
motions
sent
a
thrill
of
delight
through
my
frame
my
heart
beat
madly
as
she
turned
her
beautiful
eyes
in
the
direction
of
the
spot
in
which
i
stood
what
would
i
not
have
given
to
have
had
the
power
to
precipitate
myself
into
that
luminous
ocean
and
float
with
her
through
those
grooves
of
purple
and
gold
while
i
was
thus
breathlessly
following
her
every
movement
she
suddenly
started
seemed
to
listen
for
a
moment
and
then
cleaving
the
brilliant
ether
in
which
she
was
floating
like
a
flash
of
light
pierced
through
the
opaline
forest
and
disappeared
instantly
a
series
of
the
most
singular
sensations
attacked
me
it
seemed
as
if
i
had
suddenly
gone
blind
the
luminous
sphere
was
still
before
me
but
my
daylight
had
vanished
what
caused
this
sudden
disappearance
had
she
a
lover
or
a
husband
yes
that
was
the
solution
some
signal
from
a
happy
had
vibrated
through
the
avenues
of
the
forest
and
she
had
obeyed
the
summons
the
agony
of
my
sensations
as
i
arrived
at
this
conclusion
startled
me
i
tried
to
reject
the
conviction
that
my
reason
forced
upon
me
i
battled
against
the
fatal
conclusion
but
in
vain
it
was
so
i
had
no
escape
from
it
i
loved
an
animalcule
it
is
true
that
thanks
to
the
marvelous
power
of
my
microscope
she
appeared
of
human
proportions
instead
of
presenting
the
revolting
aspect
of
the
coarser
creatures
that
live
and
struggle
and
die
in
the
more
easily
resolvable
portions
of
the
she
was
fair
and
delicate
and
of
surpassing
beauty
but
of
what
account
was
all
that
every
time
that
my
eye
was
withdrawn
from
the
instrument
it
fell
on
a
miserable
drop
of
water
within
which
i
must
be
content
to
know
dwelt
all
that
could
make
my
life
lovely
could
she
but
see
me
once
could
i
for
one
moment
pierce
the
mystical
walls
that
so
inexorably
rose
to
separate
us
and
whisper
all
that
filled
my
soul
i
might
consent
to
be
satisfied
for
the
rest
of
my
life
with
the
knowledge
of
her
remote
sympathy
it
would
be
something
to
have
established
even
the
faintest
personal
link
to
bind
us
together
to
know
that
at
times
when
roaming
through
these
enchanted
glades
she
might
think
of
the
wonderful
stranger
who
had
broken
the
monotony
of
her
life
with
his
presence
and
left
a
gentle
memory
in
her
heart
but
it
could
not
be
no
invention
of
which
human
intellect
was
capable
could
break
down
the
barriers
that
nature
had
erected
i
might
feast
my
soul
upon
her
wondrous
beauty
yet
she
must
always
remain
ignorant
of
the
adoring
eyes
that
day
and
night
gazed
upon
her
and
even
when
closed
beheld
her
in
dreams
with
a
bitter
cry
of
anguish
i
fled
from
the
room
and
flinging
myself
on
my
bed
sobbed
myself
to
sleep
like
a
child
vi
i
arose
the
next
morning
almost
at
daybreak
and
rushed
to
my
microscope
i
trembled
as
i
sought
the
luminous
world
in
miniature
that
contained
my
all
animula
was
there
i
had
left
the
surrounded
by
its
moderators
burning
when
i
went
to
bed
the
night
before
i
found
the
sylph
bathing
as
it
were
with
an
expression
of
pleasure
animating
her
features
in
the
brilliant
light
which
surrounded
her
she
tossed
her
lustrous
golden
hair
over
her
shoulders
with
innocent
coquetry
she
lay
at
full
length
in
the
transparent
medium
in
which
she
supported
herself
with
ease
and
gamboled
with
the
enchanting
grace
that
the
nymph
salmacis
might
have
exhibited
when
she
sought
to
conquer
the
modest
hermaphroditus
i
tried
an
experiment
to
satisfy
myself
if
her
powers
of
reflection
were
developed
i
lessened
the
lamplight
considerably
by
the
dim
light
that
remained
i
could
see
an
expression
of
pain
flit
across
her
face
she
looked
upward
suddenly
and
her
brows
contracted
i
flooded
the
stage
of
the
microscope
again
with
a
full
stream
of
light
and
her
whole
expression
changed
she
sprang
forward
like
some
some
substance
deprived
of
all
weight
her
eyes
sparkled
and
her
lips
moved
ah
if
science
had
only
the
means
of
conducting
and
reduplicating
sounds
as
it
does
rays
of
light
what
carols
of
happiness
would
then
have
entranced
my
ears
what
jubilant
hymns
to
adonais
would
have
thrilled
the
illumined
air
i
now
comprehended
how
it
was
that
the
count
de
cabalis
peopled
his
mystic
world
with
beings
whose
breath
of
life
was
lambent
fire
and
who
sported
forever
in
regions
of
purest
ether
and
purest
light
the
rosicrucian
had
anticipated
the
wonder
that
i
had
practically
realized
how
long
this
worship
of
my
strange
divinity
went
on
thus
i
scarcely
know
i
lost
all
note
of
time
all
day
from
early
dawn
and
far
into
the
night
i
was
to
be
found
peering
through
that
wonderful
lens
i
saw
no
one
went
nowhere
and
scarce
allowed
myself
sufficient
time
for
my
meals
my
whole
life
was
absorbed
in
contemplation
as
rapt
as
that
of
any
of
the
romish
saints
every
hour
that
i
gazed
upon
the
divine
form
strengthened
my
passion
a
passion
that
was
always
overshadowed
by
the
maddening
conviction
that
although
i
could
gaze
on
her
at
will
she
never
never
could
behold
me
at
length
i
grew
so
pale
and
emaciated
from
want
of
rest
and
continual
brooding
over
my
insane
love
and
its
cruel
conditions
that
i
determined
to
make
some
effort
to
wean
myself
from
it
come
i
said
this
is
at
best
but
a
fantasy
your
imagination
has
bestowed
on
animula
charms
which
in
reality
she
does
not
possess
seclusion
from
female
society
has
produced
this
morbid
condition
of
mind
compare
her
with
the
beautiful
women
of
your
own
world
and
this
false
enchantment
will
vanish
i
looked
over
the
newspapers
by
chance
there
i
beheld
the
advertisement
of
a
celebrated
who
appeared
nightly
at
niblo
the
signorina
caradolce
had
the
reputation
of
being
the
most
beautiful
as
well
as
the
most
graceful
woman
in
the
world
i
instantly
dressed
and
went
to
the
theatre
the
curtain
drew
up
the
usual
semicircle
of
fairies
in
white
muslin
were
standing
on
the
right
toe
around
the
enameled
of
green
canvas
on
which
the
belated
prince
was
sleeping
suddenly
a
flute
is
heard
the
fairies
start
the
trees
open
the
fairies
all
stand
on
the
left
toe
and
the
queen
enters
it
was
the
signorina
she
bounded
forward
amid
thunders
of
applause
and
lighting
on
one
foot
remained
poised
in
the
air
heavens
was
this
the
great
enchantress
that
had
drawn
monarchs
at
her
those
heavy
muscular
limbs
those
thick
ankles
those
cavernous
eyes
that
stereotyped
smile
those
crudely
painted
cheeks
where
were
the
vermeil
blooms
the
liquid
expressive
eyes
the
harmonious
limbs
of
animula
the
signorina
danced
what
gross
discordant
movements
the
play
of
her
limbs
was
all
false
and
artificial
her
bounds
were
painful
athletic
efforts
her
poses
were
angular
and
distressed
the
eye
i
could
bear
it
no
longer
with
an
exclamation
of
disgust
that
drew
every
eye
upon
me
i
rose
from
my
seat
in
the
very
middle
of
the
and
abruptly
quitted
the
house
i
hastened
home
to
feast
my
eyes
once
more
on
the
lovely
form
of
my
sylph
i
felt
that
henceforth
to
combat
this
passion
would
be
impossible
i
applied
my
eyes
to
the
lens
animula
was
there
but
what
could
have
happened
some
terrible
change
seemed
to
have
taken
place
during
my
absence
some
secret
grief
seemed
to
cloud
the
lovely
features
of
her
i
gazed
upon
her
face
had
grown
thin
and
haggard
her
limbs
trailed
heavily
the
wondrous
lustre
of
her
golden
hair
had
faded
she
was
ill
ill
and
i
could
not
assist
her
i
believe
at
that
moment
i
would
have
forfeited
all
claims
to
my
human
birthright
if
i
could
only
have
been
dwarfed
to
the
size
of
an
animalcule
and
permitted
to
console
her
from
whom
fate
had
forever
divided
me
i
racked
my
brain
for
the
solution
of
this
mystery
what
was
it
that
afflicted
the
sylph
she
seemed
to
suffer
intense
pain
her
features
contracted
and
she
even
writhed
as
if
with
some
internal
agony
the
wondrous
forests
appeared
also
to
have
lost
half
their
beauty
their
hues
were
dim
and
in
some
places
faded
away
altogether
i
watched
animula
for
hours
with
a
breaking
heart
and
she
seemed
absolutely
to
wither
away
under
my
very
eye
suddenly
i
remembered
that
i
had
not
looked
at
the
for
several
days
in
fact
i
hated
to
see
it
for
it
reminded
me
of
the
natural
barrier
between
animula
and
myself
i
hurriedly
looked
down
on
the
stage
of
the
microscope
the
slide
was
still
there
but
great
heavens
the
water
drop
had
vanished
the
awful
truth
burst
upon
me
it
had
evaporated
until
it
had
become
so
minute
as
to
be
invisible
to
the
naked
eye
i
had
been
gazing
on
its
last
atom
the
one
that
contained
animula
and
she
was
dying
i
rushed
again
to
the
front
of
the
lens
and
looked
through
alas
the
last
agony
had
seized
her
the
forests
had
all
melted
away
and
animula
lay
struggling
feebly
in
what
seemed
to
be
a
spot
of
dim
light
ah
the
sight
was
horrible
the
limbs
once
so
round
and
lovely
shriveling
up
into
nothings
the
eyes
those
eyes
that
shone
like
heaven
being
quenched
into
black
dust
the
lustrous
golden
hair
now
lank
and
discolored
the
last
throe
came
i
beheld
that
final
struggle
of
the
blackening
form
and
i
fainted
when
i
awoke
out
of
a
trance
of
many
hours
i
found
myself
lying
amid
the
wreck
of
my
instrument
myself
as
shattered
in
mind
and
body
as
it
i
crawled
feebly
to
my
bed
from
which
i
did
not
rise
for
many
months
they
say
now
that
i
am
mad
but
they
are
mistaken
i
am
poor
for
i
have
neither
the
heart
nor
the
will
to
work
all
my
money
is
spent
and
i
live
on
charity
young
men
associations
that
love
a
joke
invite
me
to
lecture
on
optics
before
them
for
which
they
pay
me
and
laugh
at
me
while
i
lecture
linley
the
mad
microscopist
is
the
name
i
go
by
i
suppose
that
i
talk
incoherently
while
i
lecture
who
could
talk
sense
when
his
brain
is
haunted
by
such
ghastly
memories
while
ever
and
anon
among
the
shapes
of
death
i
behold
the
radiant
form
of
my
lost
animula
