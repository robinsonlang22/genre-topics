the
new
amazonia
prologue
it
is
small
wonder
that
the
perusal
of
that
hitherto
in
my
eyes
immaculate
magazine
the
affords
me
less
pleasure
than
usual
there
may
possibly
be
some
articles
in
it
both
worth
reading
and
worth
remembering
but
of
these
i
am
no
longer
conscious
for
an
overmastering
rage
fills
my
soul
to
the
exclusion
of
everything
else
one
article
stands
out
with
such
prominence
beyond
the
rest
that
to
all
intents
and
purposes
this
number
of
the
contains
nothing
else
for
me
not
that
there
is
anything
admirable
in
the
said
article
far
from
it
i
look
upon
it
as
the
most
despicable
piece
of
treachery
ever
perpetrated
towards
woman
by
women
indeed
were
it
not
that
some
of
the
perpetrators
of
this
outrage
on
my
sex
are
writers
and
society
leaders
i
would
doubt
the
authenticity
of
the
signatures
and
comfort
my
soul
with
the
belief
that
the
whole
affair
has
been
nothing
but
a
hoax
got
up
by
timorous
and
jealous
male
bipeds
already
living
in
fear
of
the
revolution
in
social
life
which
looms
before
us
at
no
distant
date
as
it
is
i
am
able
to
avail
myself
of
no
such
doubtful
solace
and
i
can
only
feel
mad
downright
other
word
is
strong
i
am
not
near
enough
to
these
traitors
to
their
own
sex
to
give
them
a
specimen
of
my
opinion
of
them
though
i
resolve
mentally
that
they
shall
taste
of
my
vengeance
in
the
near
future
if
i
can
only
devise
some
sure
method
of
bringing
this
about
but
perhaps
by
this
time
some
of
my
readers
who
may
not
have
seen
or
heard
of
the
objectionable
article
in
question
may
be
anxious
to
know
what
this
tirade
is
all
about
i
will
tell
them
but
i
must
first
allude
to
the
fact
that
my
sex
really
consists
of
three
great
divisions
to
the
first
but
not
necessarily
the
superior
division
belongs
the
class
which
prefers
to
be
known
as
ladies
or
rather
the
class
to
which
they
belong
are
generally
found
to
rest
their
claim
to
this
distinction
if
it
be
one
upon
the
fact
that
they
are
the
wives
or
daughters
of
prominent
or
members
of
the
other
sex
they
find
themselves
in
comfortable
circumstances
the
money
or
distinction
which
may
be
at
the
command
of
their
husbands
or
fathers
enables
them
to
pass
the
greater
portion
of
their
time
in
dressing
or
in
airing
such
charms
as
they
may
possess
they
lead
for
the
most
part
a
frivolous
life
and
their
greatest
glory
is
the
reflected
lustre
which
shines
upon
them
by
virtue
of
the
wealth
or
attainments
of
their
husbands
or
other
male
connections
it
is
always
noticeable
that
the
less
brains
and
claim
for
distinction
a
lady
possesses
herself
and
the
less
actual
cause
she
has
for
the
higher
and
the
more
arrogantly
does
she
hold
her
head
above
her
fellows
and
the
more
prone
is
she
to
despise
and
depreciate
every
woman
who
recognises
a
nobler
aim
in
life
than
that
of
populating
the
world
with
offspring
as
imbecile
as
herself
va
sans
that
there
are
thousands
of
ladies
to
whom
the
last
remark
is
scarcely
applicable
gentle
in
manners
and
yielding
in
disposition
they
are
perfectly
satisfied
with
the
existing
order
of
things
and
quite
believe
the
doctrine
that
man
in
his
arrogance
has
laid
down
that
he
is
the
lord
of
creation
and
that
implicit
obedience
to
his
whims
and
fancies
is
the
first
duty
of
woman
they
have
all
they
feel
necessary
to
their
well
being
they
have
husbands
who
regard
them
as
so
much
personal
property
and
who
treat
them
alternately
as
pets
or
slaves
their
wants
are
liberally
provided
for
without
any
anxiety
on
their
part
they
rather
like
the
idea
of
having
little
or
no
work
to
do
and
to
their
mind
independence
is
a
dreadful
bugbear
which
every
lady
ought
to
shun
as
she
would
shun
a
mad
dog
or
a
leper
they
are
not
to
blame
poor
things
for
they
are
what
man
and
circumstances
have
made
them
and
their
general
amiability
and
vague
notions
of
doing
what
they
have
been
taught
is
right
at
all
costs
partly
exonerates
such
of
them
as
have
been
persuaded
to
sign
the
protest
although
i
am
not
disposed
to
regard
as
the
wisest
and
most
immaculate
members
of
my
sex
i
do
not
include
in
this
category
all
those
who
would
fain
usurp
the
doubtful
distinction
of
being
regarded
as
such
for
instance
a
young
friend
of
mine
on
her
marriage
found
herself
domiciled
in
a
very
pretty
little
house
in
the
suburbs
her
domestic
staff
being
limited
to
one
one
day
while
the
latter
was
out
upon
an
errand
a
tremendous
ring
at
the
bell
put
my
friend
all
in
a
flutter
she
had
but
recently
returned
from
her
honeymoon
and
wished
to
receive
callers
with
becoming
dignity
she
would
have
preferred
the
maid
to
open
the
door
and
show
the
visitor
into
her
tiny
drawing
room
but
as
the
maid
was
not
at
home
there
was
nothing
for
it
but
to
officiate
as
herself
she
need
not
have
been
alarmed
for
the
individual
at
the
door
proved
to
be
a
big
fat
dirty
perspiring
female
with
a
large
basket
of
some
of
which
she
tried
to
persuade
my
friend
to
buy
finding
her
efforts
in
this
direction
fruitless
she
began
to
wonder
if
she
had
been
forestalled
and
somewhat
surprised
my
little
friend
by
the
following
query
if
ye
plaze
mum
can
ye
tell
me
if
there
s
been
hawking
pots
about
here
this
afternoon
no
decidedly
this
individual
s
claim
to
be
regarded
as
a
lady
was
somewhat
too
pretentious
and
it
must
be
understood
that
when
speaking
of
i
draw
the
line
at
hawkers
the
second
great
division
of
the
female
sex
is
composed
of
these
do
not
sigh
for
society
cognomens
such
as
are
essential
to
the
happiness
of
their
less
thoughtful
sisters
they
want
something
more
substantial
many
of
them
find
it
necessary
to
earn
their
own
livelihood
others
possess
a
sufficient
percentage
of
this
world
s
good
things
to
enable
them
to
banish
all
dread
of
poverty
in
their
own
lives
others
and
i
am
glad
to
say
that
this
class
is
ever
on
the
increase
prefer
to
work
simply
because
they
prize
independence
above
all
things
no
one
will
venture
to
suggest
that
these
women
are
selfish
egotists
for
their
aims
and
ambitions
embrace
the
welfare
of
half
the
human
race
at
least
and
whatever
may
be
the
ultimate
results
of
their
gallant
fight
on
behalf
of
woman
s
rights
they
will
be
only
too
thankful
to
see
them
enjoyed
by
every
other
woman
on
the
face
of
the
earth
widely
different
from
these
is
the
third
division
of
the
feminine
genus
they
are
neither
more
nor
less
when
emancipation
comes
to
them
it
will
not
be
as
a
result
of
their
own
endeavours
for
custom
perverted
education
physical
weakness
and
lack
of
energy
all
combine
to
keep
them
in
the
groove
into
which
they
have
been
mercilessly
trodden
for
centuries
fortunately
some
of
them
go
through
life
without
feeling
terribly
discontented
their
wily
subjugators
led
by
the
priesthood
have
for
centuries
played
upon
feminine
superstition
and
credulity
until
they
have
succeeded
in
making
them
believe
that
their
physical
weakness
with
its
natural
concomitant
evil
intellectual
inferiority
is
foreordained
by
an
omniscient
being
whom
they
are
expected
to
gratefully
adore
because
of
his
great
justice
and
mercy
now
and
again
some
of
these
slaves
rebel
and
are
punished
for
breaking
laws
made
by
men
for
the
benefit
of
men
sometimes
we
hear
of
some
woman
who
driven
either
by
lack
of
education
or
by
circumstances
has
committed
some
outrage
upon
society
which
calls
for
terrible
punishment
perhaps
she
has
been
unfaithful
to
a
wicked
incarnation
of
lust
and
cruelty
who
has
for
years
indulged
in
of
which
all
the
world
has
been
cognisant
she
has
had
to
put
up
with
incredible
slights
and
indignities
but
as
her
husband
has
been
cunning
enough
to
refrain
from
beating
and
starving
her
the
law
as
made
and
administered
by
men
allows
her
no
escape
from
her
irksome
marital
bonds
but
let
her
become
reckless
and
find
solace
in
another
man
s
love
then
she
becomes
a
social
pariah
against
whom
our
canting
hypocritical
pharisees
hold
up
their
hands
in
denunciatory
horror
and
from
whom
the
husband
speedily
obtains
a
judicial
separation
applauded
by
sympathising
male
humbugs
and
consoled
by
the
damages
valued
at
or
so
which
the
court
has
ordered
the
to
pay
as
a
solatium
for
his
wounded
said
will
not
be
improved
in
morals
by
the
skinning
process
he
has
undergone
but
will
turn
his
attentions
in
future
to
ladies
who
have
no
husbands
to
claim
golden
solatium
for
lacerated
feelings
corrupt
degraded
rotten
to
the
core
is
british
civilisation
and
yet
we
find
women
who
ought
to
know
better
actually
pretending
that
they
are
perfectly
contented
with
the
existing
order
of
things
and
that
brings
me
back
to
the
d
of
this
story
the
century
has
been
guilty
of
condoning
if
not
of
instigating
an
atrocity
it
has
published
a
rigmarole
signed
by
a
great
many
to
the
effect
that
woman
s
suffrage
is
not
wanted
by
and
indeed
would
hardly
be
accepted
if
it
were
offered
to
them
the
principal
signatories
are
in
comfortable
circumstances
have
no
great
cares
upon
their
shoulders
they
plume
themselves
upon
occupying
prominent
positions
in
society
it
is
to
their
interest
to
uphold
the
political
principles
of
the
men
whose
privilege
it
is
to
support
them
they
do
not
see
that
life
need
be
made
any
brighter
for
them
therefore
they
conspire
to
prevent
every
other
woman
from
emerging
from
the
ditch
in
which
she
grovels
of
course
the
other
woman
may
be
ambitious
or
industrious
or
miserable
or
oppressed
but
that
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
fine
ladies
whose
arguments
are
as
feeble
as
their
hearts
are
callous
and
whose
principles
are
as
unjustifiable
as
their
selfishness
is
reprehensible
we
have
all
we
want
say
these
fair
philanthropists
and
we
intend
to
use
our
best
endeavours
to
make
other
women
regard
their
circumstances
in
the
same
light
they
must
be
taught
to
duly
acknowledge
the
reverence
they
owe
to
man
and
god
if
we
can
not
persuade
them
that
things
are
as
they
ought
to
be
we
will
take
effectual
means
to
prevent
their
further
progress
towards
the
emancipation
some
of
them
are
treasonably
preaching
their
morals
we
will
leave
to
the
priesthood
to
coddle
and
terrorise
but
we
must
make
them
understand
that
man
always
was
always
must
and
always
will
be
of
paramount
power
and
wisdom
in
this
world
woman
was
but
made
from
the
rib
of
a
man
and
ought
to
know
from
this
fact
alone
that
she
can
never
be
his
equal
and
so
on
it
would
be
wonderful
if
i
being
a
did
not
feel
indignant
when
being
confronted
with
these
and
similar
arguments
which
if
not
all
aired
in
the
are
quite
as
strong
as
any
which
the
deluded
signatories
have
to
advance
in
support
of
the
despicably
unwomanly
attitude
they
have
adopted
only
a
rib
forsooth
how
do
they
know
that
woman
was
made
out
of
nothing
better
than
a
man
s
rib
we
have
only
a
man
s
word
for
that
and
i
have
proved
the
falsity
of
so
many
manly
utterances
that
i
would
like
some
scientific
proof
as
to
the
truth
or
falsity
of
the
argument
before
i
give
it
implicit
credence
thank
goodness
the
comes
to
the
rescue
with
a
gallant
signed
by
the
cream
of
british
womanhood
and
i
feel
viciously
glad
that
i
have
been
privileged
to
add
my
name
to
the
long
list
of
those
who
are
determined
to
stand
up
for
justice
to
their
sex
whether
they
may
happen
to
feel
the
need
of
it
in
their
own
individual
cases
or
not
i
am
also
delighted
to
find
an
influential
magazine
conducted
by
men
which
chivalrously
does
battle
on
behalf
of
my
sex
good
old
i
apostrophise
mentally
long
life
and
prosperity
be
thine
and
i
am
confidently
able
to
predict
that
there
will
be
a
persistent
and
flourishing
of
all
things
british
long
after
the
has
become
a
thing
of
the
past
but
here
my
attention
is
directed
to
the
fact
that
two
women
who
have
always
womanfully
championed
the
cause
of
their
sex
have
written
replies
to
the
suffrage
article
and
that
furthermore
the
editor
of
the
has
inserted
these
replies
in
his
review
which
forthwith
is
absolved
from
a
great
share
of
the
displeasure
which
the
atrocity
roused
not
alone
in
my
breast
but
in
thousands
of
other
men
the
last
fact
is
justly
emphasised
in
big
letters
for
it
shows
that
at
least
some
portion
of
the
male
sex
recognises
the
enormity
and
injustice
of
saddling
of
the
human
race
with
all
the
disabilities
it
is
possible
to
heap
upon
it
except
the
disabilities
of
exemption
from
taxation
and
kindred
methods
of
assisting
in
promoting
the
general
welfare
of
the
nation
when
i
mention
the
fact
that
the
two
replies
in
the
are
written
by
fawcett
and
ashton
dilke
respectively
i
have
i
think
given
sufficient
assurance
that
the
replies
are
in
themselves
able
ones
into
such
a
good
humour
in
fact
have
i
been
soothed
by
the
perusal
of
the
that
i
find
myself
stringing
together
all
sorts
of
fancies
in
which
women
s
achievements
form
conspicuous
features
and
i
am
just
noticing
how
pleasant
weldon
looks
in
the
speaker
s
chair
listening
to
besant
s
first
prime
ministerial
speech
when
my
senses
become
entirely
obfuscated
as
sambo
would
say
and
i
sink
into
slumber
as
profound
as
that
which
overcame
the
fabled
enchanted
guardians
of
my
favourite
enchanted
palace
illustration
chapter
i
the
next
event
i
can
chronicle
was
opening
my
eyes
on
a
scene
at
once
so
beautiful
and
strange
that
i
started
to
my
feet
in
amaze
this
was
not
my
study
and
i
beheld
nothing
of
the
magazine
which
was
the
last
thing
i
remembered
seeing
before
i
went
to
sleep
i
was
in
a
glorious
garden
gay
with
brilliant
hued
flowers
the
fragrance
of
which
filled
the
air
with
a
subtle
and
delicate
perfume
around
me
were
trees
laden
with
luscious
fruits
which
i
can
only
compare
to
apples
pears
and
quinces
only
they
were
as
much
finer
than
the
fruits
i
had
hitherto
been
familiar
with
as
ribstone
pippins
are
to
crabs
and
as
jargonelles
are
to
greenbacks
countless
birds
were
singing
overhead
and
i
was
about
to
sink
down
again
and
yield
to
a
delicious
languor
which
overpowered
me
when
i
was
recalled
to
the
necessity
of
behaving
more
decorously
by
hearing
someone
near
me
exclaim
in
mystified
accents
by
jove
but
isn
t
this
extraordinary
i
say
do
you
live
here
or
have
you
been
taking
hasheesh
too
i
looked
up
and
saw
perched
on
the
limb
of
a
great
tree
a
young
man
of
about
thirty
years
of
age
who
looked
so
ridiculously
mystified
at
the
elevated
position
in
which
he
found
himself
that
i
could
not
refrain
from
smiling
though
i
did
not
feel
able
to
give
an
immediate
satisfactory
reply
to
his
queries
oh
that
s
right
he
commented
it
makes
a
fellow
relieved
to
see
a
smile
when
he
wasn
t
at
all
sure
whether
he
wouldn
t
get
sent
to
jericho
for
perching
up
an
apple
tree
but
really
i
don
t
know
how
the
deuce
i
came
to
be
up
here
that
is
i
beg
your
pardon
but
i
can
t
understand
how
i
happen
to
be
up
this
apple
tree
and
oh
by
jove
it
isn
t
an
apple
tree
after
all
isn
t
it
extraordinary
but
i
could
positively
do
nothing
but
laugh
at
him
for
the
space
of
a
moment
or
two
then
i
gravely
remarked
that
as
i
supposed
he
was
not
glued
to
the
tree
he
had
better
come
down
whereat
he
followed
my
advice
being
unfortunate
enough
however
to
graze
his
hands
and
tear
the
knees
of
his
trousers
during
the
process
of
disembarkation
when
at
last
he
had
relieved
himself
of
a
few
spare
expletives
delivered
in
a
tone
which
he
vainly
flattered
himself
was
too
low
for
me
to
hear
he
stood
revealed
before
me
a
perfect
specimen
of
the
british
masher
his
height
was
not
too
great
being
i
subsequently
ascertained
five
feet
three
an
inch
less
than
my
own
but
he
made
the
most
of
what
there
was
of
him
by
holding
himself
as
erect
as
possible
and
as
he
wore
soles
an
inch
thick
to
his
otherwise
smart
boots
he
looked
rather
taller
than
he
really
was
his
proportions
were
not
at
all
bad
and
i
have
seen
a
good
many
very
much
worse
looking
fellows
who
flattered
themselves
that
they
were
quite
killing
his
face
had
lost
the
freshness
of
early
youth
and
looked
as
though
it
spent
a
great
deal
of
its
time
in
the
haunts
of
dissipation
the
moustache
however
was
golden
so
long
so
elegant
was
it
that
it
must
have
been
the
envy
of
countless
members
of
the
masher
tribe
and
i
was
not
surprised
to
notice
presently
that
its
owner
found
his
pet
occupation
in
stroking
it
just
now
however
he
was
chiefly
employed
in
lamenting
the
accident
which
had
occurred
to
his
nether
garment
this
being
by
the
way
one
portion
of
a
tweed
suit
of
the
most
alarmingly
demonstrative
pattern
and
colour
by
jove
he
muttered
disconsolately
it
s
awful
you
know
when
i
was
so
careful
too
what
on
earth
ever
possessed
me
to
mount
that
tree
isn
t
it
extraordinary
this
time
i
was
about
to
attempt
a
reply
when
i
was
struck
dumb
with
awe
and
astonishment
and
my
companion
who
had
found
his
own
eyes
sufficiently
powerful
to
take
in
my
appearance
hastily
fixed
a
single
eyeglass
into
position
and
gazed
in
wonder
at
an
apparition
which
approached
us
and
he
might
well
gaze
for
of
a
surety
the
creature
which
we
saw
was
something
worth
looking
at
and
a
specimen
of
a
race
the
like
of
which
we
had
never
seen
before
it
is
a
woman
i
thought
a
goddess
the
masher
declared
and
for
a
time
i
could
not
feel
sure
that
he
was
mistaken
she
was
close
upon
seven
feet
in
height
i
am
sure
and
was
of
magnificent
build
a
magnified
venus
a
glorified
hebe
a
smiling
juno
were
here
all
united
in
one
perfect
human
being
whose
gait
was
the
very
poetry
of
motion
she
wore
a
very
peculiar
dress
i
thought
until
i
saw
that
science
and
common
sense
had
united
in
forming
a
costume
in
which
the
requirements
alike
of
health
comfort
and
beauty
had
reached
their
acmé
a
modification
of
the
divided
skirt
came
a
little
below
the
knee
the
stockings
and
laced
boots
serving
to
heighten
instead
of
to
hide
their
owner
s
beautiful
symmetry
of
limb
a
short
skirt
supplemented
the
graceful
tunic
which
was
worn
slightly
open
at
the
neck
and
partially
revealed
the
dainty
whiteness
of
a
shapely
bust
the
whole
costume
was
of
black
velvet
and
was
set
off
by
exquisite
filmy
laces
and
by
a
crimson
sash
which
confined
the
tunic
at
the
waist
and
hung
gracefully
on
the
left
side
of
the
wearer
she
was
wearing
a
velvet
cap
which
she
courteously
doffed
on
beholding
us
and
i
noticed
that
her
hair
but
an
inch
or
two
long
curled
about
her
head
and
temples
in
the
most
delightfully
picturesque
fashion
imaginable
she
was
surprised
to
see
us
that
was
quite
apparent
but
she
evidently
mistook
our
identity
for
awhile
what
strange
children
she
exclaimed
in
a
rich
sonorous
voice
which
was
bewitchingly
musical
why
are
you
here
and
for
what
particular
purpose
are
you
masquerading
in
this
extraordinary
fashion
yes
it
is
extraordinary
isn
t
it
burst
forth
the
masher
but
you
are
slightly
mistaken
about
us
i
can
t
answer
for
this
lady
and
i
really
don
t
know
what
the
deuce
she
is
doing
here
but
i
am
the
honourable
augustus
i
daresay
you
have
heard
of
me
my
ancestor
you
know
was
king
george
the
fourth
he
fell
in
love
with
a
very
beautiful
lady
who
until
the
first
gentleman
in
europe
favoured
her
with
his
attentions
was
an
opera
singer
she
subsequently
became
the
mother
of
a
family
who
were
all
provided
for
by
their
delighted
father
the
king
the
eldest
son
was
created
duke
of
and
he
and
his
family
were
endowed
with
a
perpetual
pension
for
distinguished
services
rendered
to
the
state
you
then
you
are
not
a
little
boy
queried
the
giantess
but
of
course
you
must
be
come
here
my
little
dear
and
tell
me
who
taught
you
to
say
those
funny
things
and
who
pasted
that
queer
little
moustache
on
your
as
she
spoke
she
actually
stooped
kissed
the
honourable
augustus
on
the
forehead
and
patted
him
playfully
on
the
cheek
with
one
shapely
finger
this
was
however
an
indignity
not
to
be
borne
patiently
and
the
recipient
of
these
attentions
indignantly
sprang
on
one
side
his
face
scarlet
and
his
voice
tremulous
with
humiliated
wrath
how
dare
you
he
gasped
how
dare
you
insult
me
so
you
must
know
that
i
am
not
a
child
your
own
hugeness
need
not
prevent
you
from
seeing
that
am
a
a
man
never
o
this
is
too
splendid
a
joke
to
enjoy
by
saying
this
and
laughing
until
the
tears
came
into
her
eyes
the
goddess
raised
her
voice
a
little
and
called
to
some
companions
who
were
evidently
close
at
hand
myra
hilda
agnes
oh
do
come
quickly
i
have
found
two
such
curious
in
response
to
this
summons
three
more
girls
of
gigantic
stature
came
from
the
further
end
of
the
garden
and
completed
our
discomfiture
by
joining
in
the
laugh
against
us
what
funny
little
things
wherever
did
you
find
them
dora
queried
one
of
the
new
comers
whereat
dora
composed
her
risible
faculties
as
well
as
she
was
able
and
explained
that
she
had
just
found
us
where
we
were
and
that
one
of
us
claimed
to
be
a
myra
and
agnes
were
quite
as
amused
at
this
as
dora
had
been
but
hilda
took
the
situation
somewhat
more
seriously
she
had
noted
how
furious
the
honourable
augustus
looked
and
observed
my
vain
attempt
to
assume
a
dignified
demeanour
in
the
presence
of
such
a
formidable
array
of
playful
goddesses
who
now
all
plied
us
with
questions
together
i
did
not
feel
much
inclined
to
converse
for
i
was
terribly
afraid
of
being
ridiculed
but
hilda
questioned
me
so
much
more
sensibly
in
my
opinion
than
the
others
that
i
was
disposed
to
be
more
communicative
to
her
than
to
them
where
do
you
come
from
she
questioned
gently
as
if
she
were
afraid
of
injuring
me
by
using
her
normal
voice
i
am
english
i
replied
proudly
feeling
quite
sure
that
the
very
name
of
my
beloved
native
land
would
prove
a
talisman
of
value
in
any
part
of
the
globe
but
although
the
beautiful
quartette
refrained
from
laughing
they
listened
to
me
in
mystified
astonishment
partly
i
perceived
because
my
small
voice
was
a
revelation
to
them
and
partly
because
my
answer
conveyed
no
understandable
meaning
to
them
english
at
last
said
agnes
what
do
you
mean
by
english
there
is
no
such
nation
now
i
believe
that
centuries
ago
used
to
be
called
england
and
that
it
used
to
be
inhabited
by
the
english
a
warlike
race
which
is
now
my
dear
agnes
interposed
hilda
you
surely
forget
that
we
are
ourselves
descended
from
this
great
race
but
suppose
we
go
on
with
our
questions
not
so
fast
my
little
man
here
i
will
take
care
of
you
for
the
the
last
exclamation
was
evoked
by
an
attempt
on
the
part
of
the
honourable
augustus
to
escape
while
the
attention
of
the
party
was
concentrated
upon
myself
he
was
however
foiled
in
his
attempt
and
hilda
coolly
seated
him
upon
a
tall
garden
seat
as
if
he
were
a
baby
and
kept
a
detaining
hand
on
his
wrist
while
she
listened
to
the
replies
i
now
made
to
my
tormentors
what
is
your
name
was
the
next
interrogatory
to
which
i
was
subjected
i
did
not
consider
it
necessary
to
go
into
details
so
merely
gave
my
name
other
questions
were
now
asked
me
but
i
was
so
determined
to
give
no
food
for
ridicule
if
i
could
help
it
that
i
was
rather
obstinate
in
refusing
information
and
at
last
took
refuge
in
the
remark
delivered
as
quietly
as
my
tingling
nerves
would
permit
that
in
my
country
people
were
polite
to
strangers
and
did
not
interrogate
them
as
if
they
were
so
many
wild
even
while
giving
utterance
to
this
remark
i
remembered
several
scenes
which
proved
that
it
was
far
from
true
but
the
goddesses
did
not
know
this
much
and
my
reproof
served
to
convince
them
that
the
honourable
augustus
and
myself
were
not
monkeys
that
had
learnt
the
art
of
speech
and
been
dressed
for
exhibition
but
actual
though
very
queer
specimens
of
the
human
race
divine
apologies
for
their
rudeness
were
now
freely
tendered
by
the
giantesses
and
one
of
them
proposed
to
take
us
into
the
house
at
once
and
supply
us
with
refreshments
no
sooner
said
than
done
and
i
hardly
know
whether
i
was
most
amused
or
humiliated
to
find
myself
led
by
the
hand
as
if
i
were
only
just
learning
to
walk
and
must
be
carefully
guarded
from
stumbling
it
was
some
consolation
to
observe
that
the
honourable
augustus
was
served
likewise
and
that
he
was
lifted
up
the
huge
steps
which
must
be
ascended
to
enter
the
house
just
as
easily
as
i
was
we
were
taken
into
a
large
hall
which
seemingly
served
as
a
refectory
for
i
observed
a
table
in
the
centre
upon
which
many
covers
were
laid
just
at
this
juncture
a
great
bell
was
rung
somewhere
in
the
building
and
about
fifty
other
individuals
entered
the
room
but
crowded
round
us
instead
of
round
the
table
as
was
evidently
their
first
intention
they
were
however
upon
the
whole
quite
as
polite
as
a
room
full
of
english
people
would
be
were
our
respective
positions
reversed
and
hilda
constituted
herself
our
protector
from
bothering
questions
until
dinner
was
served
the
seats
and
table
were
on
a
somewhat
larger
scale
than
i
had
been
hitherto
used
to
but
a
cushion
considerately
brought
for
me
made
me
comfortable
enough
while
being
quizzed
by
such
a
number
of
eyes
i
diligently
used
my
own
and
noted
that
all
these
magnificent
creatures
except
six
were
apparently
young
students
and
that
they
were
all
habited
in
somewhat
similar
fashion
to
dora
such
difference
as
there
was
consisting
not
in
shape
or
cut
but
in
variety
of
material
and
colouring
the
six
exceptions
were
perfectly
beautiful
women
all
approaching
middle
age
and
with
less
exuberance
of
spirit
but
more
dignity
of
manner
than
the
others
their
dress
also
was
slightly
different
their
tunics
being
ornamented
with
rich
facings
and
their
sashes
worn
on
the
right
side
being
composed
of
a
gorgeous
material
something
like
cloth
of
gold
but
so
soft
in
texture
as
to
drape
gracefully
a
number
of
attendants
served
the
meal
and
these
were
all
attired
in
the
national
garb
with
the
exception
of
the
sashes
while
their
clothes
were
for
the
most
part
composed
of
washing
materials
in
which
they
looked
very
pictures
of
neatness
and
cleanliness
as
soon
as
the
meal
had
begun
we
were
less
scrutinised
than
we
had
been
and
i
now
discovered
myself
to
be
very
hungry
and
disposed
to
do
full
justice
to
the
appetising
viands
set
before
me
there
was
a
variety
of
dainty
dishes
to
choose
from
and
much
fruit
all
of
which
was
marvellously
sweet
and
luscious
but
there
was
no
dish
that
i
could
see
prepared
from
animal
food
and
i
resolved
to
discover
later
whether
such
a
strange
omission
was
of
regular
or
only
occasional
occurrence
chapter
ii
after
dinner
was
over
the
students
indulged
in
conversation
i
discovered
afterwards
that
music
usually
formed
a
prominent
feature
in
after
dinner
amusements
but
the
honourable
augustus
and
myself
afforded
sufficient
food
for
pastime
we
were
however
not
exactly
mobbed
though
our
audience
was
a
large
one
in
every
sense
of
the
word
one
thing
puzzled
me
exceedingly
when
i
spoke
awhile
ago
of
being
english
my
interrogators
seemed
thoroughly
mystified
and
yet
they
were
speaking
my
native
tongue
in
all
its
insular
purity
evidently
there
was
a
good
deal
to
explain
on
all
sides
augustus
had
by
this
time
got
over
his
chagrin
and
was
i
could
tell
even
congratulating
himself
in
a
mild
sort
of
way
over
the
fact
that
he
was
proving
a
much
greater
source
of
attraction
than
i
was
he
was
receiving
the
attentions
of
this
bevy
of
big
beauties
with
such
a
ridiculous
air
of
conceited
nonchalance
that
i
was
provoked
to
laughter
in
spite
of
my
polite
attempt
to
restrain
my
mirth
myra
comprehended
the
cause
of
my
amusement
and
whispered
i
see
little
lady
that
the
male
biped
is
the
same
all
the
world
over
conglomeration
of
conceit
and
arrogance
your
little
man
looks
too
funny
for
anything
and
yet
i
will
warrant
that
he
thinks
himself
capable
of
captivating
one
half
of
us
what
is
he
thought
of
in
your
country
but
to
this
question
i
was
unable
to
give
a
satisfactory
answer
as
i
could
only
say
that
i
was
perfectly
ignorant
of
everything
connected
with
the
honourable
augustus
never
having
seen
him
in
my
life
until
this
reply
amazed
myra
and
others
who
heard
it
but
further
interrogations
on
her
part
were
stopped
for
a
little
while
by
the
advent
of
the
lady
principal
and
two
of
the
professors
who
wished
to
speak
with
me
and
to
know
how
i
came
to
be
here
the
young
students
respectfully
made
way
for
them
and
i
confess
that
my
sensations
on
beholding
them
approached
something
very
near
akin
to
awe
the
lady
principal
especially
was
a
being
to
be
remembered
in
height
she
was
somewhat
superior
to
the
others
her
features
were
so
perfect
in
outline
and
expression
that
i
think
minerva
must
have
looked
like
this
woman
did
there
was
not
one
among
all
these
women
who
did
not
look
the
embodiment
of
health
principal
helen
grey
did
more
than
this
she
seemed
to
me
to
be
the
goddess
of
health
herself
and
to
be
capable
of
endowing
others
with
this
most
to
be
prized
earthly
blessing
she
sat
down
beside
me
and
gently
asked
me
who
i
was
and
how
i
happened
to
be
here
my
answer
to
the
effect
that
i
did
not
know
how
i
had
got
here
was
evidently
a
tax
on
her
credulity
but
she
was
too
well
bred
to
do
aught
but
listen
quietly
while
i
continued
my
explanations
i
told
of
my
perusal
of
certain
magazines
and
how
my
feelings
had
been
strongly
excited
upon
one
subject
until
i
must
have
gone
to
sleep
while
thinking
of
it
then
i
described
my
awaking
amid
strange
surroundings
and
that
i
supposed
the
honourable
had
been
transported
hither
also
my
account
of
our
first
interview
with
each
other
provoked
amusement
and
every
face
around
me
rippled
with
smiles
after
a
few
moment
s
musing
principal
grey
asked
me
what
i
meant
by
saying
that
a
certain
article

the

suffrage
into
my

do
you
mean
to

she
asked
that
men
are
the

voters
in
your

yes
i
replied
and
men
are
not
the

obstacle
to
woman
s
advancement
in

only
a
small
minority

dare
avow

on

subject
more
stupid

hurl
all

of
contemptible
reproaches
at
them
for
presuming
to
endeavour
to
better
the
condition
of
their

all
the
laws
of
my
country
have
been
made
by
men
and
they
are
all
made
in
the
interests
of
men
it
is
only
a
few
years
since
it
was
possible
for
a
married
woman
to
hold
property
in
her
own
right
she
might
earn
or
in
any
other
way
acquire

her

could

with
having
done
more
than
he
had
a
perfect
right
to
your
england
as
you
call
it
must
be
a
strange
country
said
principal
grey
but
i
can
not
quite
make
out
where
it
is
i
am
not
considered
ignorant
in
matters
appertaining
to
history
and
geography
but
i
am
unable
to
locate
this
england
of
yours
once
upon
a
time
a
matter
of
a
thousand
years
ago
the
neighbouring
island
which
is
now
called
was
called
albion
and
later
on
england
but
we
have
always
understood
ourselves
to
be
the
only
race
living
which
is
at
all
representative
of
england
and
the
ancient
and
what
country
is
this
i
enquired
in
my
turn
marvelling
much
to
hear
this
giantess
speak
of
the
ancient
this
country
is
new
amazonia
a
long
time
ago
it
was
called
erin
by
some
but
ireland
was
the
name
it
was
best
known
by
it
used
to
be
the
scene
of
perpetual
strife
and
warfare
our
archives
tell
us
that
it
was
subjugated
by
the
warlike
english
and
that
it
suffered
for
centuries
from
want
and
oppression
the
land
was
appropriated
by
english
mercenaries
who
exacted
enormous
rents
which
they
spent
anywhere
but
in
ireland
famines
attempted
revolutions
and
conspiracies
unjust
repressive
laws
and
all
sorts
of
calamities
are
said
to
have
ruined
and
depopulated
the
country
until
the
wars
arose
which
resulted
in
our
coming
here
but
as
all
is
so
strange
here
to
you
you
shall
if
you
care
about
it
be
taken
out
this
evening
and
then
you
will
be
better
able
to
judge
what
sort
of
people
we
are
meanwhile
our
duties
must
be
attended
to
hilda
be
good
enough
to
take
this
woman
to
your
room
until
we
can
make
other
arrangements
dear
there
is
the
little
gentleman
what
shall
we
do
with
him
the
honourable
augustus
was
being
conducted
through
the
principal
reception
rooms
of
the
college
for
such
the
building
was
and
the
question
of
his
ultimate
disposal
could
be
discussed
without
the
embarrassment
which
his
presence
might
perhaps
have
entailed
suppose
we
request
medlock
to
take
him
until
he
decides
what
his
future
arrangements
will
be
suggested
professor
wise
a
lady
who
had
hitherto
taken
no
part
in
the
conversation
it
would
never
do
to
let
him
sleep
in
the
college
for
a
night
the
poor
little
thing
s
character
would
be
irretrievably
of
course
it
would
agreed
principal
grey
and
she
set
about
making
the
necessary
arrangements
forthwith
while
i
wondering
if
i
had
been
asleep
for
five
or
six
centuries
followed
hilda
to
the
upper
story
in
which
her
sleeping
room
was
situated
but
long
before
i
reached
it
i
felt
tired
to
death
the
marble
stairs
were
exceedingly
massive
and
were
apparently
interminable
while
the
beautiful
banister
rails
were
too
large
for
me
to
grasp
them
with
my
hand
and
thus
help
myself
up
i
was
at
last
compelled
to
sit
down
exhausted
feeling
that
not
one
more
step
could
i
mount
hilda
looked
at
me
in
astonishment
as
i
sat
panting
with
my
unwonted
exertions
is
it
possible
she
cried
that
the
walk
up
these
few
steps
has
exhausted
you
you
must
be
ill
or
is
it
the
fault
of
the
queer
clothes
that
you
wear
that
you
are
incapable
of
taking
exercise
but
whichever
way
it
is
you
can
not
sit
here
so
be
kind
enough
to
excuse
the
next
moment
i
was
lifted
up
as
if
i
were
a
child
and
hilda
ran
nimbly
up
another
long
flight
of
steps
with
me
finally
depositing
me
in
a
room
that
was
very
handsomely
furnished
though
most
of
the
articles
in
it
were
of
a
style
the
like
whereof
i
had
never
seen
before
seeing
that
i
had
apparently
been
for
about
six
hundred
years
this
is
not
at
all
surprising
but
i
could
not
help
noticing
a
piano
which
was
the
facsimile
of
one
which
was
in
my
own
possession
before
i
fell
asleep
in
fact
i
had
an
idea
that
it
was
the
very
same
piano
though
how
it
got
here
i
could
not
imagine
hilda
saw
me
looking
at
it
and
did
not
remove
my
mystification
by
remarking
yes
it
is
a
curious
old
thing
isn
t
it
and
in
excellent
preservation
i
believe
we
have
several
more
of
them
in
the
capital
all
formerly
owned
by
englishwomen
who
originally
settled
in
dublin
after
the
then
is
this
dublin
i
asked
if
so
i
am
not
so
very
far
from
home
after
this
place
used
to
be
called
dublin
in
the
time
of
the
ancient
irish
but
when
the
country
was
turned
over
to
what
was
then
contemptuously
called
petticoat
government
nearly
all
were
changed
and
the
names
of
famous
women
applied
to
them
thus
we
have
fawcetville
beecherstown
weldonia
besantsville
jarrettburn
and
hundreds
of
other
names
the
etymological
origin
of
which
is
easily
traceable
in
fact
it
is
one
of
our
laws
that
no
town
or
village
shall
receive
a
name
which
does
not
commemorate
some
woman
who
has
done
all
she
could
to
advance
the
interests
of
her
our
conversation
lasted
awhile
longer
but
hilda
had
her
studies
to
attend
to
and
after
reaching
several
books
from
a
bookshelf
for
me
to
amuse
myself
with
during
her
absence
she
left
me
for
awhile
to
my
own
devices
promising
to
do
all
she
could
to
make
my
visit
a
pleasant
one
there
were
many
things
here
to
arouse
my
curiosity
but
i
was
most
anxious
to
see
if
the
books
were
printed
in
a
style
which
i
could
understand
as
i
hoped
to
gain
a
great
deal
of
information
relative
to
the
strange
land
in
which
i
found
myself
through
no
effort
of
will
on
my
own
part
fortunately
i
found
the
type
and
paper
very
beautiful
and
with
the
exception
that
the
spelling
was
considerably
more
phonetic
than
that
in
vogue
with
us
i
found
very
little
difference
between
our
language
as
at
present
printed
and
as
exponed
in
the
pages
of
the
history
of
amazonia
which
was
the
first
book
i
opened
i
must
have
spent
at
least
two
hours
in
close
reading
and
if
anyone
would
like
to
know
the
results
of
my
investigations
in
posthumous
history
she
or
he
will
find
them
recorded
in
the
next
chapter
chapter
iii
the
history
began
with
a
brief
resumé
of
such
events
as
school
books
had
long
ago
made
me
tolerably
familiar
with
but
went
on
to
say
that
it
was
in
the
reign
of
victoria
that
the
incidents
which
ultimately
resulted
in
the
disruption
of
the
british
empire
took
place
though
the
final
decisive
steps
did
not
eventuate
until
towards
the
close
of
the
reign
of
her
successor
who
used
his
utmost
endeavours
to
secure
justice
for
all
his
subjects
but
the
factious
discontent
had
been
growing
for
so
many
years
that
it
was
impossible
for
him
when
he
did
at
last
come
into
power
to
retrieve
all
the
errors
and
undo
all
the
mischief
which
had
been
done
during
the
reign
of
his
predecessor
ireland
especially
was
troublesome
for
it
had
always
been
made
to
feel
that
it
was
a
subjugated
state
the
sovereign
sedulously
petted
and
spoiled
the
northern
portion
of
her
dominions
and
was
so
inordinately
fond
of
everything
scotch
that
even
the
english
grew
jealous
when
year
after
year
the
sovereign
s
chief
desire
seemed
to
be
to
prove
that
she
possessed
no
english
sympathies
whatever
and
that
she
positively
declined
to
show
the
light
of
her
countenance
to
any
but
scotch
subjects
or
german
relatives
if
she
could
help
it
the
principal
emoluments
of
the
state
fell
to
the
share
of
alien
germans
and
british
taxpayers
were
ground
to
the
dust
while
scores
of
thousands
of
pounds
of
their
money
crossed
the
channel
for
the
support
of
germans
some
of
whom
were
not
too
illustriously
born
but
all
of
whom
found
favour
in
the
eyes
of
victoria
regina
a
great
deal
of
encouragement
being
thus
given
to
the
germans
and
scots
who
were
always
willing
to
accept
conditions
to
which
the
english
found
it
impossible
to
bow
england
became
with
them
so
much
so
indeed
that
the
natives
of
the
soil
found
it
necessary
to
emigrate
to
other
countries
in
order
to
earn
their
livelihood
and
england
itself
gradually
became
the
principal
of
a
hybrid
race
who
were
known
as
all
this
time
ireland
languished
in
a
state
of
neglect
and
discontent
which
was
eventually
fanned
into
a
fierce
flame
in
consequence
of
the
treatment
bestowed
by
the
english
government
upon
certain
patriots
whom
they
revered
there
were
several
facsimile
copies
of
allegorical
documents
which
so
evidently
referred
to
events
which
occurred
in
my
own
time
in
england
and
which
were
so
prominently
instanced
as
the
predisposing
causes
of
the
irish
revolution
that
i
subsequently
took
the
trouble
of
copying
one
of
them
and
give
it
in
full
as
follows
carolus
patriotus
a
political
allegory
and
lo
there
dwelt
in
this
country
a
man
whose
name
was
carolus
and
this
carolus
who
was
surnamed
patriotus
looked
with
bitterness
upon
the
wickedness
of
the
oppressor
and
said
unto
his
friends
and
disciples
verily
i
can
no
longer
look
upon
the
tribulations
of
my
people
but
will
gird
up
my
loins
and
will
set
forth
on
a
pilgrimage
to
the
land
of
the
and
behold
after
many
days
he
came
to
londinensis
the
chief
city
of
the
albionites
and
saw
that
which
was
not
good
in
his
sight
but
he
met
many
people
who
sate
him
at
their
board
and
who
looked
upon
him
as
the
deliverer
of
his
people
unto
them
he
said
verily
i
will
lift
up
my
voice
so
that
it
shall
be
heard
of
all
the
nations
and
i
will
open
the
eyes
of
the
people
so
that
they
shall
no
longer
look
with
favour
upon
the
evil
doings
of
their
chief
rulers
and
i
will
say
unto
them
cast
your
eyes
upon
erinea
the
country
of
my
forefathers
and
behold
how
my
brethren
gnash
their
teeth
and
struggle
in
vain
under
the
yoke
of
the
spoiler
and
and
i
will
call
upon
them
to
give
me
their
help
in
the
deliverance
of
my
people
and
my
nation
shall
bless
those
who
lift
up
their
voices
for
and
behold
all
these
things
came
to
pass
and
the
friends
of
carolus
surnamed
patriotus
said
unto
him
it
is
well
that
thou
shouldest
do
this
great
thing
and
verily
we
will
aid
thee
our
houses
shall
be
thy
houses
and
our
purses
shall
be
thy
purses
until
the
great
things
which
thou
prophesiest
shall
come
to
and
carolus
surnamed
patriotus
lifted
up
his
voice
against
the
oppressor
yea
even
in
the
assembly
of
the
rulers
of
the
albionites
did
he
lift
up
his
voice
and
many
disciples
followed
him
but
there
was
a
great
prince
in
londinensis
the
chief
city
of
the
albionites
who
waxed
wroth
at
the
preachings
of
carolus
and
who
looked
upon
his
teachings
as
evil
the
name
of
this
prince
was
tempus
londinus
and
he
said
unto
his
servants
yea
verily
this
carolus
is
a
seditious
man
and
we
must
banish
him
from
the
great
house
of
the
people
else
will
he
conquer
us
and
the
power
of
the
albionites
will
be
as
naught
in
the
eyes
of
the
and
there
came
unto
the
steward
of
tempus
surnamed
londinus
a
man
named
dupus
journalius
this
man
longed
for
riches
and
knew
much
that
was
pleasing
to
the
steward
of
tempus
unto
him
he
saith
lo
thy
servant
hath
travelled
far
to
satisfy
thy
desires
and
to
please
my
lord
the
prince
he
has
been
to
the
chief
city
of
the
erinians
and
has
spoken
to
a
man
who
dwells
there
this
man
has
a
sword
made
by
carolus
and
nothing
but
the
poison
which
is
worked
into
this
sword
can
destroy
carolus
surnamed
patriotus
carolus
made
this
sword
in
order
to
destroy
his
enemies
but
lo
he
is
now
himself
in
their
toils
and
shall
feel
the
hand
of
the
and
the
steward
of
the
mighty
tempus
said
unto
dupus
he
that
was
surnamed
journalius
fetch
this
man
hither
that
we
may
behold
this
but
dupus
answered
and
said
not
so
my
lord
for
this
thing
is
wonderful
and
judas
dublinus
will
not
sell
it
but
for
a
great
price
yea
verily
the
price
is
then
said
the
chief
steward
unto
dupus
go
thy
way
and
return
unto
me
when
thou
shalt
see
the
mighty
prince
tempus
and
his
high
priests
and
they
shall
give
thee
an
and
when
dupus
returned
on
the
morrow
he
prostrated
himself
before
tempus
londinus
and
his
high
priests
and
they
looked
with
favour
upon
him
and
gave
him
great
wealth
saying
go
thou
to
judas
surnamed
dublinus
and
give
him
of
thy
wealth
and
say
unto
him
verily
i
have
spoken
of
thee
to
the
rulers
of
the
albionites
and
thou
and
thy
doings
have
found
favour
in
their
sight
moreover
thou
shalt
not
be
punished
for
thy
sins
but
if
thou
wilt
render
unto
me
the
poisoned
sword
wherewith
to
destroy
carolus
surnamed
patriotus
thou
shalt
dwell
in
the
tents
of
the
and
dupus
journeyed
to
the
chief
city
of
the
erinians
and
told
all
those
things
unto
judas
surnamed
dublinus
who
answered
and
said
yea
verily
my
lord
hath
done
well
by
his
servant
here
is
the
sword
which
shall
destroy
carolus
surnamed
therefore
dupus
was
filled
with
joy
and
hastened
to
carry
the
sword
to
the
mighty
prince
of
the
albionites
and
the
prince
was
well
pleased
with
him
and
many
of
the
chief
rulers
of
the
people
also
rejoiced
with
him
saying
unto
each
other
now
we
shall
be
delivered
from
the
teachings
of
this
vile
impostor
and
our
country
shall
prosper
for
the
false
prophet
of
erinia
is
vanquished
and
his
disciples
shall
be
scattered
over
all
the
but
lo
and
behold
a
wonder
came
to
pass
for
when
the
high
priests
of
tempus
londinus
hurled
the
poisoned
sword
which
carolus
was
said
to
have
wrought
with
his
own
hands
yea
when
it
was
hurled
at
carolus
he
valiantly
seized
the
sword
and
fought
his
enemies
therewith
so
that
those
who
thought
to
see
him
fall
dead
were
amazed
at
his
vigour
but
although
carolus
did
not
die
he
was
sick
for
many
days
and
many
people
prophesied
that
his
end
was
near
while
his
enemies
said
rejoice
and
be
glad
for
the
foe
is
slain
and
our
enemies
are
crestfallen
and
hang
their
heads
in
shame
but
there
were
others
who
said
nay
he
shall
not
die
but
shall
live
to
plant
the
foot
of
scorn
upon
the
neck
of
his
enemy
we
will
give
freely
of
our
treasure
and
we
will
carry
him
to
the
great
apothecary
carolus
magnus
and
lo
he
will
heal
his
wounds
and
lay
bare
the
foul
sores
of
the
and
all
the
erinians
cried
aloud
unto
carolus
magnus
saying
save
our
apostle
and
let
him
not
perish
under
the
heel
of
his
now
carolus
surnamed
magnus
was
skilled
in
the
art
of
healing
and
it
came
to
pass
after
many
days
that
carolus
surnamed
patriotus
recovered
from
his
grievous
sickness
and
henceforth
the
great
prince
and
his
high
priests
looked
with
disfavour
upon
dupus
journalius
and
tempus
londinus
was
exceeding
wroth
and
sent
for
judas
surnamed
dublinus
but
the
heart
of
judas
was
filled
with
fear
so
that
he
repented
him
of
what
he
had
done
and
wandered
afar
off
sending
unto
tempus
and
his
high
priests
a
message
saying
verily
i
am
a
sinner
and
have
led
a
mighty
prince
into
error
the
sword
which
should
have
destroyed
carolus
surnamed
patriotus
was
of
a
truth
poisoned
but
the
poison
lurks
in
the
hilt
not
in
the
point
of
the
weapon
if
my
lord
falls
sick
thereof
let
him
not
blame
his
servant
judas
who
was
tempted
by
the
promise
of
great
riches
and
where
judas
goes
let
no
man
and
the
people
clamoured
for
vengeance
upon
judas
and
the
hunters
were
set
upon
the
track
of
the
betrayer
and
he
fell
into
their
hands
but
when
they
took
their
eyes
from
him
he
sprang
into
the
outermost
darkness
and
the
inhabitants
of
the
earth
knew
him
no
more
and
tempus
londinus
was
in
his
turn
grievously
sick
but
as
for
carolus
patriotus
he
grew
mightier
than
ever
and
there
was
rejoicing
in
erinia
when
he
triumphed
over
his
enemies
chapter
iv
but
although
this
carolus
patriotus
was
thus
allegorically
announced
to
be
the
victor
his
country
still
suffered
for
a
long
time
at
the
hands
of
its
rulers
disaffection
and
jealousy
increased
in
many
places
by
the
disinclination
of
the
discontented
ones
to
relieve
themselves
honourably
of
their
burdens
caused
certain
practices
to
arise
in
erinia
or
ireland
which
only
aggravated
the
reigning
misery
a
custom
called
boycotting
prevailed
whereby
all
those
who
were
suspected
or
proved
to
be
unpatriotic
were
deprived
of
all
communication
with
those
who
might
possibly
be
induced
to
do
business
with
them
people
caught
conveying
food
or
other
necessaries
to
boycotted
persons
were
ruthlessly
shot
and
very
often
horrible
cruelties
were
perpetrated
upon
harmless
cattle
in
order
to
show
that
their
owners
had
fallen
under
the
ban
morality
became
a
thing
unknown
in
the
country
farms
and
houses
were
rented
from
landholders
who
had
no
other
source
of
income
by
people
who
meant
to
live
upon
the
produce
of
the
land
but
who
were
resolved
not
to
pay
anything
for
the
privilege
this
was
accounted
quite
an
honourable
thing
to
do
and
the
worst
crime
of
which
an
irish
farmer
could
be
accused
of
being
guilty
was
paying
his
murder
was
an
excusable
necessity
but
was
a
crime
punishable
by
death
hence
landlords
found
no
encouragement
to
prove
themselves
deserving
of
confidence
whole
estates
went
to
rack
and
ruin
the
really
earnest
reformers
found
it
impossible
to
fight
longer
against
the
prevailing
misery
and
emigrated
in
large
numbers
so
that
the
country
at
last
fell
into
a
state
of
complete
anarchy
there
were
many
politicians
whose
sole
exertions
were
directed
towards
securing
to
ireland
privileges
which
would
put
it
on
an
equal
footing
with
the
sister
isle
but
other
troubles
fell
upon
great
britain
and
as
had
often
happened
before
the
affairs
of
ireland
were
set
aside
in
order
that
other
grave
difficulties
might
be
grappled
with
several
british
colonies
and
dependencies
became
alienated
the
whole
of
the
australian
dependencies
threw
off
the
yoke
of
england
the
french
became
the
ultimate
possessors
of
newfoundland
owing
to
the
supineness
of
the
government
to
which
it
looked
for
protection
a
treaty
between
the
united
states
and
france
was
the
means
of
robbing
england
of
canada
and
in
order
to
prevent
the
loss
of
further
slices
of
the
empire
great
britain
was
obliged
to
maintain
a
large
standing
army
and
navy
there
were
a
great
many
republicans
in
the
house
of
commons
and
these
people
always
played
upon
one
string
they
urged
that
all
the
troubles
and
worries
of
the
english
had
their
origin
in
the
huge
sums
of
money
which
were
paid
to
the
royal
family
which
ever
grew
more
exacting
and
rapacious
in
its
demands
for
money
so
powerfully
did
the
republicans
appeal
to
the
nation
that
many
of
the
royalists
began
to
consider
the
situation
anxiously
and
feared
lest
the
reigning
dynasty
should
be
dethroned
and
england
be
turned
into
a
republic
others
however
considered
that
so
much
had
been
done
to
conciliate
the
germans
and
scots
who
were
both
brave
and
of
great
skill
in
warfare
that
an
alliance
with
them
could
be
safely
counted
upon
in
the
event
of
a
civil
war
breaking
out
meanwhile
france
was
also
the
scene
of
great
political
changes
the
people
had
once
more
tired
of
the
republic
and
with
their
usual
extremeness
had
once
more
rejoiced
at
the
coronation
of
an
emperor
bourbonists
orleanists
and
bonapartists
were
alike
powerless
in
the
election
of
a
supreme
ruler
and
their
respective
claims
were
all
set
on
one
side
in
favour
of
an
obscure
adventurer
who
emulating
napoleon
had
used
the
army
as
the
for
his
ambition
the
french
nation
jealous
of
the
power
of
its
big
german
neighbour
gladly
placed
in
supreme
command
a
man
who
among
other
things
promised
to
make
the
hated
teuton
lick
the
dust
russian
autocracy
was
fast
becoming
a
thing
of
the
past
but
germany
steadily
grew
in
power
until
it
threatened
to
emulate
the
days
of
charlemagne
and
engulph
all
the
countries
between
which
it
was
sandwiched
such
was
the
condition
of
some
of
the
principal
countries
of
europe
when
the
irish
resolved
no
longer
to
groan
under
the
yoke
of
the
oppressor
formed
themselves
into
a
secret
society
which
embraced
nearly
all
the
nation
held
many
clandestine
meetings
at
which
all
manner
of
dark
things
were
plotted
and
finally
invoked
the
aid
of
france
in
a
grand
fight
which
they
were
going
to
make
for
independence
and
freedom
france
readily
agreed
to
the
alliance
the
proposal
having
apparently
come
at
a
most
opportune
time
the
french
always
thirst
for
power
they
are
somewhat
credulous
as
a
nation
and
are
so
vain
as
to
be
continually
overestimating
their
own
might
and
prowess
add
to
this
that
their
emperor
was
still
new
fledged
and
still
had
to
fulfil
his
promises
of
aggrandizement
and
it
will
readily
be
believed
that
there
was
little
difficulty
in
persuading
france
to
become
ireland
s
ally
in
her
crusade
against
england
not
that
france
was
honestly
bent
upon
unselfishly
befriending
another
country
it
was
thought
that
once
firmly
fixed
on
irish
soil
with
an
army
in
occupation
it
was
simply
a
question
of
changing
the
absolute
rulership
of
the
emerald
isle
in
favour
of
gallia
certain
emoluments
and
prerogatives
were
to
be
given
to
the
principal
irish
leaders
as
a
sop
to
cerberus
but
the
principal
plums
of
conquest
were
to
be
reserved
for
frenchmen
as
soon
as
la
was
fairly
vanquished
glorious
visions
of
coming
wealth
and
greatness
filled
the
minds
of
the
thousands
who
led
by
the
emperor
himself
swarmed
into
ireland
and
prepared
in
conjunction
with
their
allies
to
smash
england
s
greatness
into
infinitesimal
fragments
naturally
the
army
was
and
entertained
but
it
was
unfortunate
that
so
much
of
the
product
of
the
native
distilleries
should
have
been
consumed
in
drinking
confusion
to
their
enemies
for
bacchus
always
was
and
always
will
be
a
treacherous
friend
and
he
had
something
to
answer
for
respecting
the
ruin
utter
black
and
entire
which
erelong
overtook
his
votaries
as
england
s
statesmen
had
foreseen
they
were
able
to
count
upon
mighty
aid
from
the
scots
and
germans
and
in
their
opinion
the
issue
of
the
forthcoming
struggle
was
a
foregone
conclusion
but
germany
had
to
be
very
wary
and
circumspect
for
russia
and
austria
considered
this
a
capital
time
to
combine
with
france
and
bring
about
the
disruption
of
the
big
german
empire
there
was
even
a
treaty
signed
by
virtue
of
which
the
three
allied
emperors
were
to
share
germany
very
equitably
in
event
of
conquest
they
counted
upon
switzerland
remaining
neutral
but
were
slightly
taken
aback
when
italy
s
army
which
was
now
a
very
large
one
was
placed
at
the
disposal
of
england
and
germany
thus
enabling
the
latter
country
to
render
powerful
help
to
england
without
imperilling
its
own
safety
very
much
the
war
did
not
last
long
when
ireland
struck
the
blow
for
liberty
both
irish
and
french
fought
well
the
former
goaded
by
desperation
and
a
desire
for
revenge
the
latter
by
cupidity
and
but
their
valour
was
futile
and
there
came
a
day
when
their
united
forces
were
utterly
vanquished
and
scarcely
an
irish
or
french
soldier
was
left
to
show
that
there
had
once
been
a
united
army
fortunately
for
himself
the
emperor
was
slain
in
battle
otherwise
with
nothing
but
a
list
of
ignominious
defeats
to
show
in
what
manner
he
had
been
able
to
keep
his
brilliant
promises
he
would
have
been
disgraced
by
a
nation
that
was
once
more
enraged
at
having
shown
how
huge
was
its
capacity
for
being
duped
it
soon
transpired
however
that
the
residue
of
the
french
people
had
need
to
think
of
something
else
besides
avenging
failures
the
enemies
of
france
seized
their
opportunity
invaded
it
conquered
it
and
divided
it
undeterred
by
the
pusillanimous
threats
of
russians
and
austrians
who
judged
it
wisest
not
to
take
to
arms
when
the
situation
of
france
grew
so
desperate
thus
did
france
cease
to
be
an
independent
european
power
and
thus
also
were
finally
exterminated
the
irish
as
a
nation
for
they
were
brave
and
did
not
yield
so
long
as
a
man
could
fight
in
england
there
was
great
rejoicing
and
so
many
honours
were
heaped
upon
germans
and
scots
that
there
was
not
an
opening
left
for
an
englishman
to
lift
himself
into
prominence
the
government
of
the
country
gradually
fell
entirely
into
the
hands
of
these
aliens
and
englishmen
formed
so
small
a
minority
of
the
population
that
a
proposal
to
change
the
name
of
the
country
from
england
to
was
placed
before
parliament
and
carried
by
acclamation
all
record
of
england
so
far
as
its
constitutional
policy
was
concerned
finished
here
and
i
know
not
whether
a
ruler
in
the
direct
line
of
succession
remained
upon
the
throne
or
whether
a
republic
was
the
immediate
outcome
of
all
these
changes
or
not
i
learnt
subsequently
however
from
the
lips
of
hilda
that
at
the
time
of
my
visit
to
new
amazonia
the
chief
officer
of
state
in
was
a
people
s
agent
who
only
remained
two
years
in
office
and
was
then
replaced
by
such
successor
either
male
or
female
as
might
be
elected
by
universal
suffrage
chapter
since
the
irish
people
had
been
completely
conquered
it
behoved
england
to
take
such
measures
as
would
conduce
to
the
future
prosperity
of
the
island
and
at
the
same
time
guard
against
disaffection
and
rebellion
there
was
much
consulting
and
advising
the
irish
question
was
as
prominent
as
ever
all
manner
of
plans
were
proposed
but
were
all
in
turn
rejected
as
unfeasible
after
several
sessions
had
been
wasted
in
fruitless
debates
and
in
noisy
discussions
whereof
the
only
result
arrived
at
was
a
certain
amount
of
forensic
display
on
the
part
of
ambitious
members
a
proposition
was
mooted
which
at
first
amazed
all
who
heard
it
then
it
was
ridiculed
unmercifully
next
it
was
discussed
seriously
finally
it
was
adopted
amid
universal
enthusiasm
for
centuries
the
combined
effects
of
war
seafaring
and
emigration
had
been
to
reduce
the
male
population
of
england
to
such
an
extent
as
to
cause
the
female
portion
of
the
population
to
preponderate
enormously
so
much
so
in
fact
that
not
a
trade
or
profession
which
had
hitherto
been
regarded
by
men
as
sacred
to
themselves
was
uninvaded
by
feminine
competitors
who
considerably
to
the
dismay
of
adult
masculinity
were
steadily
proving
themselves
capable
of
doing
well
all
that
they
undertook
to
do
for
every
man
in
the
community
to
support
three
women
was
an
impossibility
even
if
he
had
desired
to
do
so
which
he
certainly
did
not
women
who
did
not
marry
were
expected
to
keep
themselves
but
by
way
of
showing
how
strictly
and
impartially
just
the
male
biped
can
be
there
prevailed
a
peculiar
system
of
payment
which
bore
its
natural
result
of
discontent
and
protest
for
instance
in
workemphast
s
establishment
several
women
were
engaged
as
assistants
they
performed
their
work
more
neatly
and
deftly
than
their
masculine
rivals
but
were
paid
only
half
as
much
for
their
services
simply
because
they
were
women
the
result
in
all
such
cases
was
that
other
expensive
men
were
ousted
to
make
room
for
some
more
underpaid
women
the
consequence
being
that
none
but
the
employers
were
satisfied
the
men
had
an
idea
that
although
it
was
only
right
that
woman
should
not
be
a
burden
on
man
she
had
no
business
to
invade
his
particular
province
of
labour
the
women
on
the
other
hand
considered
themselves
entitled
to
equal
pay
with
the
men
provided
their
work
was
equal
on
other
grounds
too
they
had
ample
cause
for
complaint
women
householders
were
compelled
to
pay
quite
as
heavy
rates
and
taxes
as
men
but
were
debarred
from
every
privilege
to
which
equal
payment
of
tribute
morally
entitled
them
although
made
to
provide
the
necessary
funds
for
governing
the
country
they
were
not
merely
debarred
from
holding
office
but
were
even
prohibited
from
having
a
voice
in
the
election
of
such
members
of
the
favoured
sex
as
aspired
to
be
the
rulers
of
the
land
a
woman
might
pay
a
large
share
of
her
income
towards
the
expenses
of
the
government
she
might
employ
a
dozen
servants
such
as
gardeners
grooms
coachmen
gamekeepers
but
although
each
of
the
men
dependent
upon
her
for
a
livelihood
no
matter
how
stupid
ignorant
or
loutish
they
might
be
was
accorded
the
privilege
of
voting
their
clever
accomplished
mistress
was
considered
to
belong
to
an
inferior
order
of
beings
to
whom
it
would
be
unwise
to
accord
privileges
seeing
that
they
were
not
supposed
to
have
sufficient
sense
to
use
these
privileges
wisely
again
adultery
alone
on
the
part
of
a
wife
was
quite
sufficient
ground
for
a
divorce
in
favour
of
the
husband
but
a
wife
must
have
a
husband
who
in
addition
to
being
persistently
and
openly
unfaithful
cruelly
her
and
took
a
cowardly
advantage
of
the
superiority
of
strength
he
had
attained
through
having
systematically
deprived
woman
of
every
recreation
before
the
law
made
by
men
for
the
benefit
of
men
would
afford
her
relief
from
her
daily
tortures
it
is
on
record
that
a
judge
when
a
woman
was
being
tried
for
the
presumed
murder
of
her
husband
dwelt
with
such
horror
upon
the
most
dreadful
fact
that
she
had
been
unfaithful
to
her
husband
and
proved
so
conclusively
that
a
woman
who
could
be
unfaithful
was
capable
of
every
crime
under
the
sun
that
the
jury
remembering
that
their
interests
as
husbands
must
be
protected
sentenced
the
woman
to
be
hanged
although
medical
witnesses
showed
that
she
could
not
be
a
murderess
seeing
that
the
cause
of
her
husband
s
death
was
a
drug
of
which
he
was
proved
to
have
been
a
systematic
partaker
from
this
it
will
be
argued
that
purity
of
living
held
high
rank
with
the
english
but
this
was
by
no
means
the
case
for
in
the
same
decade
the
rebellion
and
protests
of
women
were
naturally
aroused
by
the
foulest
and
most
disgusting
legislation
that
ever
disgraced
the
land
this
was
the
state
regulation
of
vice
whereby
the
most
respectable
women
were
liable
to
be
subjected
to
brutal
indignities
in
order
that
no
precaution
might
be
neglected
which
would
ensure
for
men
complete
immunity
from
the
consequences
of
systematic
libertinism
and
immorality
this
may
sound
paradoxical
but
it
is
not
the
less
sickening
in
its
shameful
reality
and
serves
to
show
the
hollowness
and
insincerity
of
masculine
legislators
it
is
small
wonder
that
these
and
other
crying
evils
brought
forth
the
fruits
they
did
systematic
injustice
roused
the
antipathy
of
women
who
besides
having
sense
enough
to
argue
their
own
case
had
sufficient
moral
courage
to
brave
the
animadversion
which
was
levelled
at
them
by
the
arrogant
idiots
of
the
one
sex
and
the
unreasoning
imbeciles
of
the
other
hence
the
expressions
which
we
come
across
at
times
which
to
modern
new
amazonians
unacquainted
with
history
are
unintelligible
but
which
had
their
own
bitter
meaning
at
the
time
they
were
in
use
bluestocking
was
a
term
of
opprobrium
levelled
at
women
who
strove
to
improve
their
moral
and
intellectual
status
by
means
of
study
a
woman
s
rights
advocate
was
described
as
an
individual
who
was
the
fit
butt
for
the
laughter
and
derision
of
the
rest
of
the
community
to
be
was
a
wonderful
claim
to
respect
in
a
man
men
were
fond
of
speaking
of
women
as
the
and
therefore
inferior
sex
and
yet
the
moment
a
woman
proved
herself
to
be
not
but
she
was
regarded
as
an
anomaly
and
sneered
at
as
a
being
who
had
unsexed
herself
to
be
only
a
woman
was
equivalent
in
the
minds
of
many
male
egotists
to
being
only
something
better
than
his
dog
and
something
dearer
than
his
horse
and
yet
no
sooner
did
she
prove
herself
gifted
with
abilities
hitherto
cherished
as
exclusively
masculine
and
therefore
infinitely
superior
to
womanly
attributes
than
she
was
said
to
have
become
masculine
and
regarded
as
an
object
of
horror
to
be
a
woman
was
to
be
one
unit
of
a
despised
race
and
yet
to
unsex
herself
was
one
of
the
most
opprobrious
faults
of
which
a
woman
could
be
guilty
could
anything
be
more
idiotic
or
paradoxical
and
is
it
to
be
wondered
at
that
it
became
necessary
for
men
to
their
vaunted
superiority
and
that
they
were
gradually
impelled
from
sheer
fear
of
the
future
to
grant
the
demands
of
the
sex
which
was
rapidly
learning
to
estimate
itself
at
its
true
value
no
struggle
recorded
in
history
can
compare
with
the
fight
against
oppression
which
was
now
carried
on
by
the
brave
and
noble
ancestresses
of
whom
we
have
such
good
reason
to
be
proud
many
and
disheartening
were
the
defeats
they
endured
but
gloriously
triumphant
was
their
final
victory
of
which
our
existence
as
an
independent
nation
was
the
outcome
universal
suffrage
wonderful
was
the
jubilation
when
it
became
an
accomplished
fact
and
wonderful
were
its
effects
upon
the
nation
all
the
anomalies
above
described
were
wiped
away
and
women
showed
themselves
so
much
more
just
and
so
much
more
capable
of
governing
than
men
that
they
invariably
enacted
none
but
strictly
fair
and
impartial
regulations
thus
boards
of
guardians
consisted
of
an
equal
number
of
women
and
men
the
latter
superintended
many
details
as
formerly
but
were
relieved
from
the
sole
responsibility
of
seeing
after
the
babies
feeding
bottles
and
the
mothers
needs
and
the
old
women
s
baths
which
they
had
until
now
considered
their
own
especial
province
formerly
none
but
male
inspectors
were
allowed
to
perambulate
the
schools
at
the
expense
of
the
country
and
adjudicate
as
to
the
quality
of
make
and
perfection
of
cut
of
the
underclothing
for
women
which
the
girls
were
instructed
to
prepare
for
examination
strange
to
say
it
was
not
without
considerable
opposition
that
women
were
admitted
to
be
fit
to
usurp
this
cherished
masculine
prerogative
from
time
immemorial
the
fact
that
all
doctors
were
men
had
proved
a
serious
calamity
for
thousands
of
women
let
their
infirmities
grow
upon
them
until
it
was
too
late
to
save
their
lives
simply
because
they
were
reluctant
to
confide
the
details
of
their
ailments
to
members
of
the
other
sex
who
in
most
cases
were
complete
strangers
to
them
and
yet
the
universities
were
for
ages
shut
in
the
face
of
women
who
were
anxious
to
remedy
these
evils
and
many
and
hard
were
the
rebuffs
and
insults
which
were
endured
by
the
first
women
who
succeeded
in
removing
all
barriers
and
in
passing
the
examinations
which
qualified
them
as
s
houses
were
erected
on
principles
which
men
regarded
as
perfect
but
which
women
invariably
found
to
be
wofully
deficient
in
matters
appertaining
to
hygiene
and
comfort
since
women
became
architects
these
evils
were
also
remedied
and
as
their
augmented
influence
now
penetrated
everywhere
a
great
change
of
necessity
came
over
the
whole
nation
and
paved
the
way
for
one
of
the
greatest
political
events
the
world
has
ever
seen
this
was
the
resolve
to
colonise
ireland
with
the
women
who
outnumbered
the
men
so
enormously
in
it
was
duly
remembered
that
the
country
had
hitherto
never
managed
to
support
itself
and
that
its
periodical
famines
had
been
a
source
of
enormous
expense
to
which
even
now
was
voting
large
sums
for
the
support
of
the
widows
and
children
of
the
men
who
had
fallen
in
the
late
disastrous
rebellion
many
debates
were
therefore
held
respecting
the
annual
amount
which
should
henceforth
be
devoted
to
the
maintenance
of
authority
in
ireland
but
careful
thought
on
the
part
of
the
greatest
leaders
of
the
colonisation
movement
resulted
in
the
island
being
altogether
given
up
to
the
sole
rule
and
governance
of
the
chief
colonists
home
rule
was
the
watchword
and
it
was
finally
agreed
that
a
treaty
of
alliance
should
be
signed
whereby
ireland
or
new
amazonia
as
it
was
henceforth
called
should
maintain
friendly
relations
with
the
but
should
be
a
perfectly
and
independent
state
exempt
from
any
allegiance
but
that
of
friendliness
and
a
mutual
desire
to
prevent
the
encroachments
of
foreigners
in
return
for
so
immense
a
concession
it
was
stipulated
that
new
amazonia
should
now
be
and
very
few
but
enthusiasts
remembering
the
past
history
of
the
island
believed
in
anything
but
a
total
collapse
of
the
new
government
fortunately
for
our
land
there
were
vast
numbers
of
enthusiastic
believers
in
the
available
resources
of
new
amazonia
and
in
the
capacity
of
its
chosen
leaders
so
that
the
fifty
millions
of
pounds
with
which
it
was
necessary
to
be
equipped
in
order
to
start
the
new
enterprise
on
a
sound
basis
was
raised
in
a
remarkably
short
time
three
and
a
half
per
cent
consols
were
issued
and
were
eagerly
bought
up
by
the
enormous
numbers
of
women
who
desired
to
become
colonists
in
the
new
republic
and
to
partake
of
the
advantages
and
opportunities
which
would
then
be
theirs
great
financiers
were
also
found
willing
to
become
partners
in
this
novel
syndicate
and
as
the
consols
were
bought
up
in
every
european
country
every
european
country
was
directly
interested
in
the
prosperity
of
new
amazonia
and
the
spirit
and
courage
of
its
leaders
was
the
prominent
topic
of
conversation
in
the
whole
of
the
civilised
world
chapter
vi
it
was
intended
that
the
government
should
consist
of
a
leader
two
prime
advisers
twelve
privy
counsellors
and
two
tribunes
all
elected
by
the
people
as
a
preliminary
measure
however
only
fifty
inaugurators
were
chosen
by
the
parliament
and
upon
these
devolves
the
selection
of
the
swarms
of
women
who
clamoured
to
become
members
of
the
new
republic
the
inaugurators
were
divided
into
five
committees
consisting
of
ten
members
each
these
were
named
respectively
the
financial
the
medical
the
social
the
political
and
the
religious
the
financial
committee
was
the
first
which
the
candidate
had
to
face
no
woman
was
accepted
for
membership
who
could
not
invest
a
certain
sum
of
money
in
new
amazonian
consols
this
rule
served
a
twofold
purpose
it
prevented
the
intrusion
of
women
whose
poverty
would
make
them
a
burden
to
the
rest
of
the
community
which
above
all
things
required
a
fair
start
and
by
making
every
member
a
partner
in
the
monetary
venture
it
ensured
the
personal
interest
of
every
inhabitant
of
the
country
in
its
permanent
prosperity
the
medical
committee
was
next
entrusted
with
a
careful
examination
of
all
those
who
had
been
able
to
satisfy
committee
number
one
every
woman
who
bore
the
slightest
trace
of
disease
or
malformation
about
her
was
rigorously
rejected
and
those
who
passed
the
second
stage
satisfactorily
were
handed
over
to
the
tender
mercies
of
the
social
committee
whose
mission
it
was
to
enquire
into
the
antecedents
of
the
candidates
and
weed
out
such
as
were
likely
to
prove
discreditable
to
the
rest
few
of
the
women
having
reached
this
stage
of
the
examinations
found
any
difficulty
in
agreeing
to
the
conditions
of
committees
four
and
five
they
were
simply
required
to
take
an
oath
of
allegiance
to
the
new
government
and
to
swear
to
obey
any
laws
or
rules
which
might
be
made
by
the
constitution
they
also
vowed
to
merge
all
religious
differences
and
to
conform
to
whatever
religious
doctrines
might
be
ultimately
agreed
upon
as
a
safe
basis
for
the
establishment
of
a
national
church
when
all
these
preliminaries
were
duly
gone
through
the
candidate
paid
her
money
received
satisfactory
security
for
it
signed
certain
documents
and
was
henceforth
a
duly
enrolled
citizen
of
new
amazonia
pledged
to
respect
all
its
laws
and
entitled
to
participate
in
all
its
benefits
when
the
inaugural
committees
satisfied
that
the
enterprise
could
now
be
floated
without
further
delay
decided
to
remove
the
scene
of
their
operations
to
dublin
as
the
capital
city
of
the
new
republic
had
hitherto
been
called
there
was
great
excitement
in
london
a
banquet
was
given
in
honour
of
the
pioneers
of
the
movement
and
the
government
entered
so
cordially
into
the
spirit
of
the
great
enterprise
as
to
ensure
free
travelling
expenses
to
their
future
home
to
all
accepted
new
amazonians
who
were
willing
to
avail
themselves
of
the
privilege
in
many
cases
this
was
a
great
boon
for
although
no
men
were
accepted
as
colonists
the
future
was
provided
for
by
the
admission
of
all
the
healthy
children
of
enrolled
citizens
as
only
a
small
proportion
of
the
adventurers
were
women
who
had
been
married
the
number
of
children
was
small
enough
to
be
comfortably
provided
for
proclamations
had
been
issued
announcing
many
benefits
which
were
to
fall
to
the
lot
of
the
very
small
remnant
of
the
irish
nation
and
it
was
anticipated
that
when
they
found
themselves
to
be
enjoying
equal
privileges
with
the
new
comers
they
would
lose
the
resentful
demeanour
they
had
hitherto
maintained
and
be
amenable
to
the
dictates
of
kindness
and
reason
it
was
many
years
however
before
the
last
flickerings
of
their
discontent
were
extinguished
and
before
they
could
be
induced
to
take
kindly
to
the
mode
of
living
universally
enforced
throughout
the
country
this
end
being
finally
attained
the
mingled
races
became
amalgamated
and
were
henceforth
alike
devoted
to
their
country
and
its
constitutional
laws
it
was
well
for
new
amazonia
in
the
end
that
a
good
many
irish
women
had
survived
for
the
arts
of
and
which
they
perpetuated
and
improved
are
among
the
most
valuable
sources
of
revenue
of
the
country
shortly
after
the
inaugurators
were
established
in
dublin
castle
a
general
election
was
called
and
all
the
members
of
the
constitution
were
duly
elected
these
elections
were
to
be
triennial
none
of
the
officials
to
be
eligible
for
two
successive
parliaments
the
country
was
divided
into
two
hundred
and
fifty
districts
each
of
which
elected
its
own
tribune
and
paid
for
the
maintenance
of
that
tribune
during
her
term
of
office
the
salaries
of
the
leader
prime
advisers
and
privy
councillors
were
fixed
upon
a
progressive
basis
and
were
payable
by
the
state
the
national
revenue
was
a
question
which
required
much
anxious
thought
but
a
solution
of
the
problem
was
eventually
arrived
at
which
was
in
course
of
time
supplemented
by
the
present
existing
arrangements
the
state
was
to
be
the
only
importer
no
private
competition
being
permitted
hence
the
question
of
excise
became
a
thing
of
the
past
the
appointment
of
a
great
many
officials
to
regulate
the
export
and
import
trade
was
necessitated
and
this
at
once
gave
employment
to
hundreds
of
receiving
and
exporting
agents
who
in
their
turn
required
the
services
of
clerks
all
the
goods
which
arrived
in
the
country
were
paid
for
by
the
state
and
transferred
at
a
percentage
of
profit
to
wholesale
merchants
with
capital
enough
to
pay
for
large
business
transactions
of
this
nature
careful
tariffs
were
drawn
up
and
the
maximum
of
profit
chargeable
by
the
state
upon
all
goods
labeled
as
necessaries
was
five
per
cent
luxuries
however
all
yielded
twenty
per
cent
profit
to
the
state
from
the
hands
of
the
wholesale
merchant
all
goods
were
transferred
to
retail
dealers
and
by
them
placed
within
the
reach
of
the
people
at
large
in
order
to
prevent
the
largest
capitalists
from
absorbing
the
whole
of
the
national
trade
different
branches
were
not
permitted
to
be
adopted
by
one
merchant
or
retail
dealer
thus
no
draper
was
allowed
to
sell
groceries
furniture
ironmongery
stationery
or
anything
else
which
did
not
legitimately
appertain
to
the
drapery
business
and
other
traders
were
restricted
by
similar
regulations
by
adopting
this
method
the
state
prevented
one
or
two
firms
from
making
huge
fortunes
at
the
expense
of
fifty
less
opulent
traders
as
was
the
case
in
where
the
system
of
compound
establishments
syndicates
and
corners
prevailed
to
a
disastrous
extent
at
first
the
export
traffic
was
not
large
but
was
regulated
in
a
similar
manner
to
the
import
trade
the
state
was
the
ultimate
receiver
and
final
vendor
of
all
goods
exported
a
percentage
of
profit
being
exacted
on
all
goods
sent
away
as
the
trade
of
the
country
stimulated
by
the
energy
and
determination
of
its
new
inhabitants
steadily
increased
the
revenues
derived
by
the
state
were
enormous
and
no
other
method
of
taxation
was
deemed
necessary
we
thus
have
for
the
first
time
the
spectacle
of
a
highly
civilised
country
in
which
the
is
as
every
sort
of
employment
which
presented
itself
had
to
be
done
by
women
the
question
of
a
convenient
working
attire
which
should
at
the
same
time
be
suitable
healthy
warm
and
becoming
was
soon
brought
up
for
discussion
after
much
debate
and
strenuous
opposition
on
the
part
of
some
advocates
of
changeable
fashions
it
was
decided
to
adopt
a
national
distinctive
dress
the
wearing
of
which
should
be
compulsory
latter
day
new
amazonians
find
it
difficult
to
believe
that
the
barbarous
mode
of
dressing
which
had
prevailed
among
the
english
and
later
among
the
was
reluctantly
abandoned
by
thousands
of
women
and
that
the
new
amazonian
national
dress
should
have
been
strenuously
objected
to
at
first
there
is
in
the
museum
at
garrettville
an
instrument
of
torture
on
exhibition
called
a
corset
its
extreme
width
is
eighteen
inches
and
it
is
an
almost
incredible
fact
that
this
instrument
once
spanned
the
waist
of
a
woman
who
was
only
following
one
of
the
maddest
and
silliest
fashions
ever
instituted
when
she
deliberately
forced
her
ribs
out
of
their
proper
places
and
prepared
an
early
grave
for
herself
in
order
that
she
might
meet
with
the
favour
of
some
idiot
of
the
other
sex
who
preferred
fashion
and
doctor
s
bills
to
health
and
happiness
the
children
who
came
with
their
mothers
to
new
amazonia
were
housed
in
existing
large
buildings
until
suitable
erections
for
their
reception
could
be
designed
and
built
their
supervision
and
education
was
for
a
time
entrusted
to
the
mothers
subject
to
the
directions
of
a
trained
staff
of
teachers
physical
education
was
all
that
was
aimed
at
until
the
child
s
tenth
birthday
had
been
passed
the
most
careful
attention
was
paid
to
diet
the
necessary
proportions
of
heat
flesh
and
being
supplied
to
them
all
cooked
in
such
palatably
scientific
methods
as
conduced
to
build
up
a
perfect
system
swimming
running
dancing
drill
gymnastics
and
every
physical
game
in
vogue
constituted
the
curriculum
of
youngsters
under
ten
in
the
old
country
thousands
of
little
ones
were
pining
from
bodily
lassitude
and
decay
engendered
by
the
brain
work
necessitated
by
a
senseless
system
of
cramming
and
examining
in
new
amazonia
the
children
entering
school
at
the
age
of
ten
were
splendidly
robust
had
a
healthy
strong
mind
in
a
healthy
strong
body
and
were
capable
without
fatigue
of
learning
more
in
two
years
than
their
contemporaries
learned
in
all
the
seven
years
they
had
been
compelled
to
attend
school
for
six
years
the
school
course
had
to
be
pursued
then
a
choice
of
trade
or
profession
adapted
to
the
abilities
of
the
student
was
made
the
next
four
years
were
devoted
to
the
learning
of
this
trade
and
the
earnings
of
the
next
five
years
were
appropriated
by
the
state
which
thus
remunerated
itself
for
the
heavy
expense
of
maintaining
and
educating
each
of
its
subjects
under
twenty
years
of
age
at
the
age
of
each
subject
was
at
liberty
to
appropriate
her
earnings
as
she
liked
but
was
also
expected
to
provide
her
own
board
and
residence
henceforth
as
no
men
were
admitted
to
any
of
the
chief
offices
some
of
them
emigrated
but
others
were
glad
to
remain
and
adopted
various
trades
which
rendered
them
acceptable
and
useful
members
of
the
community
in
course
of
time
a
desire
was
manifested
on
the
part
of
several
couples
to
cast
in
their
lot
together
and
it
became
necessary
to
pay
some
attention
to
the
marriage
laws
which
as
they
had
existed
in
were
totally
rejected
by
new
amazonians
as
altogether
obsolete
and
stupidly
conducive
to
crime
and
immorality
the
marriage
contract
under
the
new
code
of
laws
became
a
purely
civil
one
dissolvable
almost
without
cost
upon
one
or
other
of
the
parties
to
it
proving
incompatibility
or
unfaithfulness
on
the
part
of
the
other
a
document
received
by
each
of
the
divorcees
legally
entitled
them
to
marry
again
provided
they
fulfilled
every
other
necessary
condition
a
medical
certificate
of
soundness
had
to
be
procured
before
anyone
was
allowed
to
marry
as
above
all
the
state
was
determined
to
secure
none
but
healthy
subjects
sometimes
very
painful
scenes
were
witnessed
for
each
child
was
subjected
to
examination
and
no
crippled
or
malformed
infants
were
permitted
to
live
as
all
children
were
considered
the
property
of
the
state
neither
wife
nor
husband
was
responsible
for
their
maintenance
and
education
and
when
a
divorce
was
in
prospect
it
was
not
necessary
to
take
the
offspring
of
the
temporary
union
into
consideration
at
all
though
no
divorces
were
permitted
until
after
the
birth
of
any
expected
result
of
such
union
nursing
mothers
were
always
welcomed
with
their
children
and
were
maintained
by
the
state
so
long
as
the
latter
required
their
attendance
there
was
however
a
determination
on
the
part
of
the
government
to
guard
against
the
evils
of
in
the
future
and
malthusian
doctrines
were
stringently
enforced
any
woman
or
man
becoming
the
parent
of
more
than
four
children
was
punished
for
such
recklessness
by
being
treated
as
a
criminal
and
deprived
of
many
very
valuable
civil
rights
it
had
often
been
the
objection
of
legislators
in
the
old
country
that
woman
s
suffrage
would
in
some
never
satisfactorily
explained
manner
cause
an
access
of
immorality
in
the
land
seeing
that
immoral
women
would
have
as
much
right
to
vote
as
their
more
virtuous
sisters
the
stupidity
and
selfishness
of
such
an
argument
is
easily
deducible
from
the
fact
that
a
large
number
of
the
male
members
themselves
were
men
who
led
anything
but
moral
lives
health
of
body
the
highest
technical
and
intellectual
knowledge
and
purity
of
morals
has
ever
been
the
goal
aimed
at
in
new
amazonia
and
it
can
boast
of
being
the
most
perfect
the
most
prosperous
and
the
most
moral
community
in
existence
chapter
vii
there
existed
many
places
of
worship
in
the
country
which
were
at
first
used
indiscriminately
by
catholics
protestants
jews
wesleyans
presbyterians
quakers
and
a
host
of
other
sects
whose
varied
religious
beliefs
were
so
perplexing
and
confusing
and
provocative
of
so
many
quarrels
and
discussions
that
sectarianism
was
soon
recognized
as
the
rock
upon
which
the
nation
was
likely
to
founder
unless
prompt
legislation
was
brought
to
bear
upon
the
situation
some
believed
in
a
trinity
of
gods
some
in
a
unity
others
looked
forward
to
the
coming
of
a
redeemer
others
worshipped
jesus
christ
as
the
redeemer
of
souls
some
denied
a
god
altogether
and
asserted
that
all
the
higher
forms
of
life
were
the
outcome
of
evolution
others
again
worshipped
a
goddess
called
humanity
and
all
were
more
or
less
in
fear
of
a
mythical
being
to
whom
all
the
untold
millions
born
into
the
world
were
supposed
to
be
turned
over
for
everlasting
punishment
in
the
event
of
their
not
having
been
fortunate
enough
to
meet
with
all
the
requirements
of
creeds
formulated
by
men
thus
one
portion
of
the
community
had
been
taught
that
tiny
babes
dying
before
they
had
been
sprinkled
with
water
by
a
priest
and
had
a
certain
formula
of
words
uttered
over
them
would
be
consigned
to
everlasting
perdition
and
debarred
from
all
the
joys
of
a
future
life
others
would
have
been
brought
up
to
believe
that
all
the
untold
millions
of
people
who
had
by
force
of
circumstances
over
which
they
had
not
the
slightest
control
never
had
christianity
preached
to
them
would
also
be
delivered
into
the
hands
of
satan
could
anything
be
more
blasphemously
opposed
to
the
character
of
a
merciful
creative
being
than
to
suppose
it
capable
of
producing
myriads
of
human
beings
simply
that
they
might
be
consigned
to
torture
such
as
only
fiends
could
sanction
bigotry
sectarianism
and
dogmatic
obstinacy
had
taken
the
place
of
a
true
and
simple
worship
of
the
creator
so
rank
did
the
strife
become
that
certain
sects
actually
maintained
it
to
be
wicked
to
enter
a
place
of
worship
patronised
by
a
rival
sect
so
truly
religious
were
the
majority
of
christians
that
they
only
used
the
various
churches
as
a
means
of
advancing
their
temporal
power
and
statistics
from
all
the
world
will
prove
that
more
lives
have
been
lost
and
more
crimes
committed
in
the
name
of
religion
than
from
any
other
cause
strange
that
what
should
be
regarded
as
the
greatest
bond
of
unity
upon
earth
should
be
so
abused
as
to
become
one
of
its
greatest
powers
for
evil
yet
so
it
was
when
our
forerunners
peopled
this
land
and
they
were
compelled
to
adopt
stringent
methods
of
grappling
with
the
most
serious
evil
in
their
midst
the
earth
was
too
beautiful
and
life
itself
was
too
great
a
mystery
for
the
doctrine
of
a
bounteous
creator
to
be
entirely
abandoned
so
worship
was
offered
and
temples
dedicated
to
the
service
of
the
giver
of
life
who
was
always
pictured
as
loving
and
beneficent
and
to
whom
no
fearful
qualities
were
attributed
such
as
for
ages
made
professing
christians
live
a
life
of
fear
lest
they
should
really
not
be
saved
and
caused
those
who
were
taught
to
regard
themselves
as
transgressors
to
die
a
death
of
horror
and
despair
the
doctrines
preached
henceforth
were
gratitude
to
the
giver
of
life
and
the
duty
to
others
of
leading
a
pure
and
moral
existence
a
simple
creed
this
but
one
which
all
were
ultimately
able
to
adopt
and
the
worship
of
morality
never
had
any
other
effect
upon
the
worship
of
than
to
render
it
all
the
more
sincere
and
heartfelt
all
fear
of
a
future
state
is
banished
from
the
minds
of
new
amazonians
who
refuse
to
believe
in
a
prince
of
darkness
and
discard
the
doctrine
of
everlasting
punishment
entirely
a
continuance
of
life
hereafter
is
firmly
believed
in
the
goal
of
bliss
being
supposed
to
be
the
ultimate
perfection
which
will
make
the
soul
so
glorious
in
knowledge
and
purity
as
to
bring
it
near
to
herself
and
enable
it
to
revel
in
the
supreme
happiness
afforded
to
all
who
have
left
ignorance
and
imperfection
behind
a
priesthood
was
established
after
a
time
in
new
amazonia
but
was
bereft
of
the
especial
privileges
hitherto
deemed
inseparable
from
that
holy
office
but
which
were
now
regarded
as
the
principal
causes
of
the
corruption
perversion
of
truth
and
immorality
which
prevailed
in
the
churches
of
and
other
countries
no
salary
was
attached
to
the
office
whatever
and
thus
religion
was
deprived
of
its
chief
means
of
abuse
for
formerly
disreputable
persons
who
could
command
influence
were
not
debarred
from
choosing
the
sacred
office
of
priest
and
from
drawing
the
large
profits
which
in
many
cases
were
derivable
from
their
appointment
in
the
church
was
simply
regarded
as
an
easy
and
lucrative
profession
in
new
amazonia
it
is
an
honour
only
bestowed
upon
capable
people
who
already
possess
a
sufficient
income
to
enable
them
to
dispense
with
a
further
addition
to
it
the
doctrines
they
have
to
expound
are
simple
and
their
principal
duty
consists
in
providing
professors
each
of
high
repute
in
their
various
professions
to
lecture
at
different
periods
of
that
day
which
is
still
in
accordance
with
ancient
usage
set
apart
as
the
day
of
general
cessation
from
ordinary
toil
since
it
is
not
given
one
soul
to
be
perfect
in
everything
and
since
the
attempted
study
of
everything
would
result
in
perfection
in
nothing
each
individual
hopes
to
become
more
speedily
sure
of
final
perfection
by
using
all
available
means
of
improvement
in
what
is
at
present
the
chief
business
of
life
and
by
attending
the
lectures
provided
by
the
guardian
for
the
purpose
of
elucidating
the
most
intricate
technicalities
of
each
trade
and
profession
in
existence
the
lecturers
are
chosen
by
the
state
and
are
all
paid
a
uniform
salary
as
many
places
would
be
too
small
to
repay
for
the
domiciling
of
a
complete
staff
of
lecturers
in
their
midst
a
system
of
travelling
prevails
whereby
the
lecturers
travel
from
one
place
to
another
so
that
each
member
of
the
community
may
have
opportunities
of
attaining
individual
perfection
by
receiving
public
instruction
in
her
or
his
special
vocation
all
railways
water
companies
and
similar
great
undertakings
are
in
the
hands
of
the
state
which
receives
all
surplus
profits
and
pays
its
employés
more
liberally
than
private
companies
ever
did
in
former
days
a
fixed
percentage
is
always
taken
by
the
state
should
the
proceeds
be
more
than
the
state
percentage
the
surplus
becomes
the
perquisite
of
the
working
staff
who
thus
receive
a
graduated
addition
to
their
income
should
bad
work
or
bad
management
reduce
the
profits
the
state
still
takes
its
fixed
percentage
and
it
is
thus
made
the
individual
interest
of
all
persons
employed
by
the
state
to
do
their
best
to
promote
the
success
of
whatever
department
of
state
labour
is
entrusted
to
them
the
were
guilty
of
many
practices
which
are
rigorously
prohibited
in
new
amazonia
one
of
these
was
the
use
of
the
dried
leaves
of
a
plant
called
tobacco
by
some
it
was
put
in
the
mouth
and
the
juice
masticated
out
of
it
by
the
majority
of
users
it
was
slowly
burnt
and
the
resulting
smoke
allowed
to
pass
into
the
mouth
to
be
emitted
immediately
after
in
clouds
of
an
unpleasant
choking
nature
the
practice
is
in
many
old
works
described
as
dirty
and
offensive
yet
it
is
an
undoubted
fact
that
the
discontinuance
of
the
use
of
tobacco
was
so
rebelled
against
and
so
distasteful
to
many
new
amazonian
women
that
frequent
expulsions
from
the
country
took
place
before
the
custom
was
stamped
out
in
all
times
there
have
been
many
vices
attributed
to
the
habit
of
imbibing
fluids
which
were
so
remarkable
in
their
effects
that
the
users
of
them
were
deprived
of
both
sense
and
motion
besides
suffering
bodily
illness
it
is
the
boast
of
new
amazonia
that
an
intoxicant
can
not
be
procured
in
the
island
and
that
all
existing
establishments
for
the
manufacture
of
these
dangerous
compounds
were
devoted
to
more
noble
uses
the
majority
of
were
carnivorous
like
dogs
cats
and
birds
of
prey
flesh
eating
is
a
habit
which
induces
coarseness
of
mind
and
body
and
robs
both
of
the
true
beauty
and
vigour
furnished
by
a
vegetable
diet
that
never
intended
the
human
animal
to
be
carnivorous
is
proved
by
the
anatomy
of
the
human
frame
it
is
however
probable
that
new
amazonia
became
a
vegetarian
nation
in
consequence
of
the
repugnance
or
inability
of
the
first
women
who
came
over
from
to
kill
the
animals
from
whose
carcases
the
beef
pork
and
mutton
they
had
hitherto
consumed
was
obtained
they
probably
found
it
a
great
deprivation
to
subsist
without
a
large
proportion
of
animal
food
at
first
and
it
was
for
a
time
extensively
imported
vegetarian
and
humanitarian
doctrines
were
extensively
preached
and
in
course
of
time
as
the
art
of
cookery
was
more
carefully
cultivated
the
trade
in
meat
carcases
ceased
entirely
to
the
ultimate
permanent
advantage
of
the
nation
than
which
no
finer
race
exists
in
the
world
at
this
moment
it
is
on
record
that
the
ancients
paid
great
attention
to
the
diet
and
housing
of
the
animals
intended
either
for
slaughter
for
beasts
of
burden
or
for
the
chase
and
that
they
knew
exactly
what
food
would
produce
the
most
coveted
results
thus
they
would
subject
their
animals
to
one
kind
of
treatment
calculated
to
produce
fat
while
a
change
of
diet
would
be
productive
of
lean
flesh
any
other
results
aimed
at
would
be
treated
with
corresponding
acumen
they
even
were
able
to
produce
a
cruel
disease
in
geese
whereby
their
livers
were
inordinately
enlarged
these
diseased
livers
were
used
in
the
construction
of
certain
pies
called
which
were
consumed
in
large
quantities
by
those
who
could
afford
the
high
prices
charged
for
them
and
yet
incredible
as
it
may
seem
these
people
had
scarcely
the
most
elementary
knowledge
of
the
necessary
means
of
preserving
the
lives
of
their
children
and
rearing
them
in
a
methodical
or
scientific
manner
no
restraints
were
placed
upon
the
people
relative
to
the
number
of
their
offspring
for
thousands
of
children
died
daily
through
the
ignorance
and
incapacity
of
those
who
were
entrusted
with
the
rearing
of
them
thus
partially
counteracting
one
evil
by
the
infliction
of
another
incalculable
suffering
being
the
invariable
accompaniment
of
such
of
mundane
affairs
if
the
offspring
of
the
attained
maturity
they
were
the
subjects
of
such
miseries
as
make
new
amazonians
often
wonder
how
they
supported
life
s
burden
their
social
pleasures
were
perpetually
ruined
by
their
inability
to
understand
the
signs
of
the
weather
until
a
tempest
was
upon
them
such
a
thing
as
altering
the
direction
of
a
steady
wind
and
thereby
producing
either
wet
or
fine
weather
by
means
of
a
huge
artificially
created
vacuum
had
never
been
thought
of
neither
had
they
attained
the
scientific
knowledge
which
enables
us
to
prevent
disastrous
thunderstorms
by
utilising
all
superfluous
electricity
that
would
otherwise
accumulate
and
work
mischief
so
much
was
the
life
of
the
ancients
dominated
by
the
perpetual
changes
of
weather
in
the
british
islands
that
it
is
said
that
no
conversation
ever
took
place
in
their
day
without
some
allusion
to
the
weather
being
made
in
it
their
lives
were
rendered
unbearable
by
constant
troubles
which
innumerable
diseases
wrought
on
their
frames
and
by
the
removal
of
some
dear
friend
by
death
the
advance
of
age
was
not
looked
for
with
delight
and
eagerness
as
with
us
for
it
brought
with
it
an
appalling
train
of
evils
the
body
waxed
feeble
and
bent
the
eyes
grew
dim
and
often
sightless
the
senses
of
taste
smell
and
hearing
became
impaired
the
voice
cracked
and
made
the
speech
harsh
and
shaky
the
teeth
fell
out
after
gradually
and
painfully
decaying
in
the
mouth
the
gait
became
unsteady
the
mind
grew
feeble
and
the
whole
body
was
transformed
into
a
pitiable
spectacle
of
ruin
and
misery
soon
to
fall
into
the
grave
unless
one
of
the
fell
diseases
to
which
these
our
ancestors
were
subjected
swept
them
out
of
life
long
ere
this
science
was
then
in
its
infancy
and
transfusion
of
blood
was
scouted
as
useless
and
impracticable
or
many
of
the
troubles
of
those
days
might
have
been
avoided
all
these
things
were
bad
enough
to
endure
but
when
we
remember
that
the
greater
part
of
the
human
race
was
led
to
expect
nothing
better
after
bodily
death
than
a
continuance
of
the
spiritual
ego
in
a
state
of
horrible
and
torture
then
indeed
we
may
be
thankful
that
we
are
free
from
so
many
of
the
ills
to
which

chapter
viii
i
closed
the
book
which
i
had
been
perusing
with
a
sense
of
the
liveliest
amazement
was
it
possible
i
thought
that
this
wonderful
people
had
really
conquered
disease
decay
death
and
the
elements
the
suggestion
seemed
so
wild
and
my
surroundings
altogether
were
so
strange
that
i
pinched
myself
to
make
sure
that
i
had
not
really
left
my
earthly
casing
behind
me
and
emerged
into
another
world
whereof
the
grovelling
nature
of
my
former
existence
had
failed
to
give
me
any
conception
but
no
i
was
as
sensitive
to
pain
as
ever
i
had
been
and
to
make
the
situation
once
more
one
of
active
reality
hilda
presently
made
her
it
was
well
for
me
that
she
seemed
to
have
taken
a
strong
fancy
to
me
otherwise
i
should
never
have
been
able
to
feel
so
much
at
ease
in
her
presence
as
i
did
true
she
was
not
more
than
nineteen
years
of
age
so
she
told
me
and
was
still
pursuing
the
studies
which
were
to
qualify
her
to
become
a
lecturer
on
chemical
science
but
her
physique
was
so
splendid
and
her
mental
qualities
of
such
surprising
vigour
for
one
so
young
as
she
that
it
was
impossible
for
me
to
regard
myself
other
than
as
a
very
inferior
being
in
her
presence
she
was
very
pleased
to
find
that
i
had
been
able
to
read
the
books
she
had
placed
at
my
disposal
but
her
powers
of
belief
were
severely
taxed
when
i
insisted
that
the
retrospect
referring
to
the
peculiar
habits
and
customs
of
the
ancients
was
a
faithful
picture
of
things
as
they
still
existed
in
my
own
country
to
tell
you
the
truth
she
said
at
last
i
think
that
you
have
been
asleep
for
about
six
hundred
years
you
must
have
been
taking
schlafstrank
though
i
had
no
idea
it
had
been
so
long
in
and
pray
what
is
schlafstrank
and
what
are
its
uses
i
asked
whereupon
i
was
told
that
schlafstrank
was
an
essence
discovered
in
the
year
by
ada
of
garretville
while
senior
lecturer
in
chemistry
for
that
year
the
uses
to
which
this
essence
was
devoted
was
to
put
people
to
sleep
for
a
longer
or
a
shorter
period
of
time
according
to
the
quantity
inhaled
or
swallowed
while
under
the
influence
of
schlafstrank
any
amount
of
pain
could
be
borne
without
causing
the
subject
of
it
any
real
inconvenience
since
no
sense
of
pain
or
bodily
suffering
was
conveyed
to
the
sleeping
mind
thus
if
in
unusual
exception
to
the
rule
of
perfect
health
which
prevailed
here
some
dangerous
or
painful
disease
overtook
any
of
the
children
of
the
state
be
they
old
or
young
they
were
subject
to
the
influence
of
schlafstrank
and
then
dosed
or
operated
upon
until
the
disease
was
conquered
in
this
way
did
new
amazonians
avoid
suffering
and
it
struck
me
as
marvellous
to
picture
them
as
the
subjects
of
an
accident
resulting
in
a
few
broken
limbs
and
being
unconscious
of
any
inconvenience
arising
therefrom
during
the
processes
of
setting
and
recovery
i
was
told
that
schlafstrank
produced
no
deleterious
effect
upon
the
body
although
repeated
doses
were
given
if
the
patient
s
mind
threatened
to
awake
before
complete
recovery
of
the
body
had
set
in
one
thing
mystified
me
exceedingly
i
was
told
that
schlafstrank
was
not
invented
until
the
year
and
naturally
asked
what
year
this
was
supposed
to
be
no
doubt
there
was
ample
room
for
amusement
on
both
sides
when
i
positively
averred
that
the
year
was
not
yet
at
an
end
and
hilda
insisted
just
as
positively
that
this
was
the
year
not
a
little
to
my
surprise
an
attendant
knocked
at
the
door
and
presented
me
with
a
parcel
with
the
words
from
the
the
mother
i
queried
and
hilda
pitying
my
ignorance
informed
me
that
the
state
was
the
mother
of
her
people
and
that
no
doubt
the
parcel
contained
a
suitable
outfit
for
me
on
opening
the
parcel
i
found
the
latter
surmise
to
be
correct
and
i
was
eased
of
the
last
remnant
of
embarrassment
i
might
have
entertained
at
the
idea
of
encroaching
upon
the
hospitality
of
others
by
being
informed
that
it
was
considered
a
personal
honour
for
any
individual
member
of
the
state
to
be
permitted
to
dispense
the
mother
s
hospitality
to
all
comers
no
stranger
was
permitted
to
seek
private
hospitality
but
was
provided
at
the
behest
and
expense
of
the
mother
with
everything
necessary
for
comfort
while
in
new
amazonia
i
suggested
that
if
this
were
generally
known
the
country
was
in
danger
of
being
by
loafers
and
adventurers
of
all
nations
this
argument
was
met
by
the
information
that
no
strangers
were
permitted
to
land
except
such
as
showed
good
reason
for
their
advent
if
by
any
chance
a
person
obtained
access
to
the
country
who
was
inclined
to
abuse
its
hospitality
she
or
he
was
subjected
to
a
course
of
labour
which
more
than
sufficed
to
pay
expenses
and
was
then
promptly
expelled
one
of
the
numerous
fleet
of
trading
steamers
which
new
amazonia
now
possessed
being
used
as
a
means
of
transport
to
the
culprit
s
own
country
hilda
s
duties
were
not
quite
completed
but
she
told
me
that
if
i
would
induct
myself
in
my
new
garments
during
her
absence
she
would
return
to
me
as
soon
as
possible
and
that
she
was
deputed
to
inform
me
that
principal
grey
and
professor
wise
were
prepared
to
escort
me
on
a
tour
round
the
city
if
i
cared
to
go
geht
ohne
that
i
jumped
at
the
offer
metaphorically
speaking
and
that
i
exerted
myself
to
the
utmost
to
transform
my
outward
semblance
by
wasting
no
time
ere
i
changed
my
own
attire
for
the
national
costume
a
bountiful
state
had
placed
at
my
disposal
i
availed
myself
of
a
marble
bath
which
hilda
had
shown
me
and
even
half
resolved
to
sacrifice
my
hair
in
my
desire
to
make
myself
as
less
like
an
oddity
as
possible
the
clothes
proved
a
good
fit
if
the
term
could
be
applied
to
garments
whose
chief
beauty
consisted
in
the
absolute
freedom
from
constraint
which
they
exercised
over
the
body
i
noticed
one
omission
which
i
was
inclined
to
regret
no
graceful
sash
formed
part
of
my
outfit
and
i
learnt
afterwards
that
none
but
natives
of
the
soil
or
formally
adopted
immigrants
were
permitted
to
adorn
themselves
with
this
distinctive
national
badge
i
was
very
much
relieved
when
on
the
return
of
hilda
she
pronounced
me
to
be
so
passable
as
to
be
sure
to
escape
the
annoyance
of
being
conspicuously
ancient
looking
my
diminutive
stature
being
now
the
only
specially
noticeable
feature
about
me
provided
my
hair
could
be
hidden
upon
trial
my
new
velvet
cap
proved
too
inadequate
a
means
of
securing
the
desired
end
and
with
something
akin
to
a
pang
i
must
confess
i
empowered
hilda
to
deprive
me
of
what
i
had
hitherto
been
taught
to
regard
as
woman
s
glory
no
sooner
however
was
i
bereft
of
all
superabundant
tresses
than
i
decided
that
the
men
who
have
from
time
to
time
so
zealously
exhorted
women
to
wear
their
hair
long
have
done
it
from
an
innate
conviction
that
the
practice
was
debilitating
and
inconvenient
and
therefore
likely
to
prove
an
invaluable
aid
in
the
final
subjugation
of
woman
unlike
samson
of
old
i
rejoiced
in
my
newly
acquired
lack
of
hirsute
adornment
and
went
on
my
way
rejoicing
i
also
found
locomotion
so
much
easier
in
my
new
attire
that
the
marble
stairs
had
no
terrors
for
me
and
the
interest
i
felt
in
all
i
saw
proved
a
powerful
incentive
to
exertion
i
was
not
sorry
to
find
that
we
were
to
be
fortified
with
another
meal
before
starting
on
our
exploring
expedition
as
at
the
previous
meal
there
was
no
animal
food
but
the
fare
was
scientifically
perfect
and
calculated
to
appeal
powerfully
to
the
senses
by
its
appetising
odour
and
appearance
three
meals
per
diem
proved
to
be
the
rule
here
and
i
observed
that
compared
to
their
physique
the
appetites
of
the
new
amazonians
seemed
to
be
very
moderate
this
was
no
doubt
due
to
the
fact
that
every
item
of
food
consumed
was
of
such
a
nature
that
it
at
once
supplied
all
the
wants
of
the
body
and
that
all
indigestible
or
innutritive
foods
had
long
ago
been
banished
from
new
amazonian
regimen
as
injurious
on
account
of
the
useless
waste
of
bodily
force
entailed
in
digesting
or
assimilating
them
i
was
however
glad
to
find
that
tea
was
not
condemned
as
entirely
useless
and
i
thoroughly
enjoyed
this
third
and
last
meal
of
the
day
after
which
i
was
taken
out
to
explore
posthumous
dublin
now
called
andersonia
once
when
paying
a
flying
visit
to
petersburg
i
was
much
struck
by
the
large
scale
upon
which
all
the
principal
streets
and
buildings
were
planned
and
when
i
arrived
in
london
not
very
long
after
this
i
felt
positively
relieved
at
the
sight
of
the
comparatively
narrow
and
dingy
london
streets
and
buildings
and
the
sense
of
glare
and
unreality
which
made
itself
palpable
in
petersburg
promptly
vanished
in
the
atmosphere
of
london
smoke
palaces
theatres
golden
domes
and
gaudy
blue
and
white
and
gilt
churches
appealed
less
to
my
fancy
than
did
the
solid
stone
beauties
of
london
architecture
grimy
though
they
might
be
in
looking
upon
andersonia
i
was
forcibly
reminded
of
both
the
cities
just
mentioned
there
were
the
same
large
open
squares
revealing
broad
streets
planned
with
mathematical
exactitude
and
the
same
huge
buildings
that
i
had
noticed
in
petersburg
but
there
was
also
the
same
solidity
freedom
from
glare
and
honesty
of
composition
which
roused
my
admiration
when
looking
upon
some
of
london
s
magnificent
stone
buildings
here
however
were
examples
of
architecture
such
as
i
had
never
before
seen
the
like
of
for
magnificence
and
it
was
no
detriment
to
their
beauty
that
they
were
unsullied
by
smoke
or
dirt
this
seemed
a
very
large
city
and
must
have
contained
a
numerous
population
yet
not
one
smoking
chimney
did
i
see
the
weather
was
delightfully
mild
but
of
course
heat
was
necessary
for
cooking
in
my
ideas
a
fire
was
just
as
necessarily
associated
with
smoke
and
i
expressed
my
surprise
at
its
evident
absence
considerably
to
my
astonishment
i
had
some
difficulty
in
making
myself
understood
but
in
the
end
mutual
enlightenment
was
the
result
of
our
confabulations
electricity
was
made
so
thoroughly
subservient
to
human
will
that
it
supplied
light
heat
and
powers
of
volition
besides
being
made
to
perform
nearly
every
conceivable
domestic
use
so
well
were
the
elements
analysed
and
understood
here
that
thunderstorms
were
unknown
and
the
force
which
yearly
used
to
slay
numbers
of
people
was
now
attracted
cooped
and
subjugated
to
human
necessities
the
skies
were
unclouded
the
air
delightfully
bracing
the
atmosphere
so
clear
and
pure
that
i
wondered
if
some
strange
change
had
not
occurred
to
my
eyesight
since
i
could
see
miles
and
miles
of
fair
country
lovely
villages
and
populous
towns
whichever
way
i
looked
smoke
was
an
imponderable
quantity
here
by
virtue
of
the
apparati
fixed
in
every
dwelling
which
permitted
not
even
the
destruction
by
fire
of
the
household
refuse
which
was
daily
committed
to
the
furnace
to
sully
the
purity
of
the
atmosphere
i
enquired
if
fires
were
frequent
here
and
was
told
that
in
the
manufacture
or
adaption
of
every
material
in
use
either
for
building
purposes
or
for
decorative
and
personal
application
there
was
incorporated
a
substance
which
rendered
it
impervious
to
fire
and
practically
indestructible
there
was
not
the
slightest
noise
of
traffic
in
the
streets
such
as
i
had
always
been
accustomed
to
hear
in
either
large
or
small
towns
on
each
side
of
every
street
there
was
a
double
means
of
locomotion
provided
water
cars
abounded
and
by
way
of
proving
their
comfort
and
efficiency
to
me
the
two
women
who
escorted
me
took
their
seats
in
one
of
them
and
somewhat
nervously
i
followed
their
example
in
another
moment
i
noticed
houses
and
streets
fly
past
us
with
magical
rapidity
but
this
phenomenon
ceased
almost
immediately
and
i
looked
through
the
glass
sides
of
the
car
upon
a
totally
new
scene
dublin
bay
in
all
its
glorious
beauty
lay
unfolded
to
my
vision
but
i
was
hardly
able
to
appreciate
it
at
that
moment
for
i
was
possessed
by
the
idea
that
i
was
under
the
influence
of
magic
the
magic
subsequently
resolved
itself
into
a
marvellous
adaptation
of
hydraulic
force
it
was
our
car
not
the
houses
which
had
been
flying
with
electric
speed
yet
so
noiseless
and
so
apparently
motionless
had
we
been
that
the
illusion
was
perfect
and
i
seemed
not
to
have
moved
the
pressure
of
an
electric
button
stopped
a
car
instantaneously
and
at
the
same
time
prevented
any
succeeding
car
from
passing
a
given
point
until
all
obstruction
ahead
was
removed
these
stoppages
lasted
only
an
infinitesimally
short
time
for
all
the
cars
whether
for
passenger
or
goods
traffic
were
pulled
up
to
the
inner
barrier
of
the
double
roadway
leaving
a
clear
course
for
all
cars
which
were
still
pursuing
their
journey
i
could
not
see
any
water
but
was
told
that
the
whole
traffic
of
the
country
was
run
upon
these
electric
hydraulic
ways
and
that
water
had
been
found
so
noiseless
so
frictionless
so
economical
and
so
superior
in
every
way
to
the
locomotive
railways
formerly
in
use
as
to
supersede
the
latter
a
few
hundred
years
ago
puffing
billy
in
fact
was
now
only
a
memory
the
first
line
of
one
of
dagonet
s
ballads
billy
s
dead
and
gone
to
glory
came
to
my
mind
as
applicable
to
the
motive
force
which
in
my
own
days
was
considered
impossible
to
beat
his
knell
was
sounded
when
there
appeared
a
rival
on
the
scene
who
brought
neither
noise
dirt
vibration
nor
smoke
in
her
train
accidents
were
of
almost
impossible
occurrence
on
the
hydraulic
roads
i
was
told
and
ordinary
street
traffic
was
not
interfered
with
by
these
roads
as
they
were
constructed
upon
elevated
platforms
all
persons
using
them
paid
a
certain
sum
for
the
privilege
the
state
had
entire
control
of
the
waterways
and
derived
considerable
revenues
from
them
after
paying
all
expenses
and
remunerating
the
thousands
of
people
who
were
employed
upon
them
the
remotest
part
of
new
amazonia
could
i
was
told
be
reached
in
twenty
minutes
at
small
cost
as
the
waterway
system
scarcely
left
a
village
untouched
i
was
initiated
in
many
wonders
that
night
being
not
the
least
interested
by
an
inspection
of
the
many
strange
objects
to
be
seen
in
the
shop
windows
and
by
the
universal
good
humour
and
happiness
which
seemed
to
illumine
every
face
i
met
my
guides
proved
themselves
to
be
admirable
and
patient
cicerones
fortunately
for
me
they
recognised
that
my
physical
capabilities
were
greatly
inferior
to
their
own
and
did
not
quite
drag
me
about
until
i
was
tired
to
death
so
far
i
was
highly
satisfied
with
my
adventures
in
new
amazonia
and
when
i
retired
to
rest
in
the
luxurious
bed
provided
for
me
i
slept
soundly
and
healthily
until
hilda
awoke
me
and
told
me
that
it
was
time
to
get
a
bath
and
dress
for
breakfast
chapter
ix
it
could
not
be
more
than
five
o
clock
i
was
sure
and
i
did
not
feel
much
inclined
to
rise
at
such
an
unconscionably
early
hour
until
i
heard
hilda
ask
if
i
would
not
like
to
go
to
the
large
baths
with
her
and
have
a
swim
alas
aquatic
exercises
were
utterly
out
of
my
power
to
undertake
but
this
fact
did
not
deprive
me
of
all
desire
to
witness
the
doings
of
others
and
i
hurriedly
left
my
couch
performed
my
toilet
expeditiously
and
accompanied
hilda
to
the
splendid
swimming
baths
in
which
scores
of
women
were
disporting
themselves
their
bathing
costume
was
neat
and
elegant
but
at
the
same
time
thoroughly
utilitarian
and
they
seemed
as
much
at
home
in
the
water
as
on
the
water
was
conducted
from
the
sea
and
was
always
cool
and
fresh
owing
to
the
mechanical
arrangements
which
existed
for
changing
it
i
could
not
help
wishing
that
i
could
swim
dive
and
float
like
these
more
favoured
beings
but
womanfully
resisted
all
attempts
to
induce
me
to
learn
the
art
there
and
then
in
all
ages
and
in
all
countries
there
have
been
isolated
women
who
have
been
regarded
as
beautiful
specimens
of
their
sex
in
new
amazonia
the
difficulty
would
consist
in
finding
women
who
were
not
perfect
models
of
beauty
grace
and
dignity
as
i
contemplated
the
happy
groups
before
me
i
had
ample
opportunity
to
convince
myself
that
not
one
of
them
owed
her
superb
proportions
to
artificial
means
and
i
was
positively
thankful
that
i
measured
quite
inches
round
the
waist
had
i
measured
a
fraction
less
i
should
have
been
looked
upon
as
deformed
in
this
land
of
goddesses
i
noticed
that
some
of
the
bathers
not
content
with
simple
diving
propelled
themselves
to
a
great
height
by
means
of
trapezes
they
would
when
at
the
desired
altitude
suddenly
relinquish
their
hold
upon
the
trapeze
turn
a
somersault
and
plunge
straight
as
a
die
into
the
volume
of
water
beneath
there
were
many
other
ways
here
practised
of
varying
and
elaborating
these
swimming
exercises
but
no
one
appeared
in
the
least
degree
fatigued
by
them
and
i
was
told
that
every
child
was
taught
swimming
from
its
third
year
upwards
and
that
cases
of
drowning
were
seldom
heard
of
in
this
favoured
land
after
breakfast
the
students
repaired
to
their
different
classes
and
i
resolved
to
venture
out
alone
my
suggestion
that
i
should
do
so
meeting
with
no
opposition
my
want
of
stature
scarcely
warranted
the
assumption
that
i
was
a
adult
and
the
absence
of
a
sash
proclaimed
me
to
be
of
alien
race
but
i
did
not
doubt
now
that
i
should
meet
with
anything
but
the
most
courteous
treatment
principal
grey
placed
a
slip
of
paper
in
my
hand
which
proved
to
be
a
pass
such
as
the
state
furnished
to
all
its
guests
and
was
neither
more
nor
less
than
an
open
sesame
to
all
public
buildings
such
as
picture
galleries
and
museums
it
was
also
intended
to
enable
me
to
make
such
use
as
i
chose
of
the
my
first
impression
that
this
was
a
country
of
none
but
women
had
been
dissipated
on
the
previous
evening
by
seeing
great
numbers
of
men
either
working
or
bent
upon
pleasure
they
were
magnificent
beings
all
of
them
and
presented
a
superb
appearance
such
as
would
have
rendered
them
in
london
society
their
consideration
i
have
decided
not
to
describe
their
attire
my
friend
augustus
told
me
that
he
meant
to
produce
a
book
detailing
all
his
adventures
in
new
amazonia
and
it
would
hardly
be
fair
to
anticipate
all
he
has
got
to
say
although
i
started
on
my
exploring
tour
with
a
very
good
heart
i
was
not
at
all
sorry
when
some
one
presently
rushed
up
to
me
and
shook
my
hand
with
most
effusive
familiarity
this
some
one
turned
out
to
be
augustus
he
was
as
much
transformed
as
i
was
being
dressed
now
i
nearly
betrayed
his
secret
after
all
considerably
to
my
amusement
he
professed
to
be
very
much
disgusted
at
being
compelled
to
renounce
his
wonderful
tweeds
and
high
collar
in
favour
in
favour
of
garments
that
were
very
much
more
artistic
and
comfortable
like
myself
he
was
thrown
upon
his
own
resources
for
a
time
so
we
resolved
to
explore
in
concert
and
exchange
impressions
by
the
way
woman
has
by
man
been
credited
with
an
undying
propensity
to
have
the
last
word
on
each
and
every
occasion
where
talking
has
to
be
done
my
personal
conviction
is
that
every
man
who
utters
this
fallacy
knows
very
well
that
it
is
a
libel
on
my
sex
and
that
he
is
only
warding
off
by
acting
on
the
principles
of
first
attack
thus
molly
muddle
tells
bungle
that
miss
pringle
is
too
ugly
for
anything
she
has
no
sooner
committed
this
indiscretion
than
she
becomes
afraid
that
it
will
be
brought
home
to
her
and
resolves
to
preserve
her
own
reputation
for
charity
by
straightway
informing
miss
pringle
that
bungle
is
taking
her
character
away
she
repeats
and
enlarges
upon
this
statement
until
she
actually
grows
to
believe
it
herself
it
is
just
so
with
the
men
who
try
to
foist
their
own
failings
upon
women
they
are
just
so
many
molly
muddles
fully
bears
out
this
assertion
by
insisting
upon
giving
me
all
his
experiences
before
i
can
get
many
words
in
and
by
treating
me
to
a
repetition
of
them
which
lasts
until
it
is
time
to
fulfil
our
engagements
to
return
in
time
for
the
meal
and
do
you
know
i
am
going
to
write
everything
down
that
i
see
while
i
am
here
he
informs
me
volubly
nothing
shall
escape
my
notice
in
fact
i
have
begun
my
book
already
for
it
doesn
t
do
to
trust
to
memory
and
as
my
grasp
of
the
subject
is
something
extraordinary
i
expect
my
book
will
be
no
end
of
a
success
if
i
ever
go
back
to
the
old
oddly
enough
i
say
i
have
also
resolved
to
publish
my
impressions
of
new
ah
yes
i
daresay
is
the
supercilious
reply
of
course
there
can
be
no
harm
in
your
trying
but
you
are
only
a
woman
and
can
not
be
expected
to
produce
anything
clever
however
i
like
you
and
don
t
mind
touching
your
work
up
a
bit
before
you
send
it
to
the
printers
in
that
way
it
may
possibly
be
presentable
though
of
course
it
is
sure
to
be
rather
commonplace
just
listen
to
my
opening
feeling
considerably
like
a
cat
whose
coat
is
being
stroked
the
wrong
way
as
i
listened
to
these
flattering
encomiums
on
my
mental
qualifications
i
nevertheless
paid
particular
attention
to
my
friend
s
opening
sentences
of
which
the
following
is
a
transcript
the
other
night
i
was
with
some
fellows
in
london
and
we
all
took
some
hasheesh
to
make
us
dream
then
i
woke
up
a
tree
then
i
saw
somebody
laughing
at
me
and
i
came
down
and
tore
my
trousers
after
that
a
whole
troop
of
giantesses
in
queer
clothes
came
and
had
a
look
at
me
they
didn
t
take
any
notice
of
the
other
party
for
she
was
only
a
woman
one
of
the
giantesses
kissed
me
and
called
me
the
handsomest
fellow
she
had
ever
seen
i
like
that
one
immensely
and
i
am
seriously
thinking
of
marrying
her
i
understand
that
the
marriage
laws
here
are
just
the
ticket
for
rollicking
bohemian
fellows
like
me
if
my
wife
doesn
t
prove
very
obedient
and
docile
i
can
chuck
her
over
and
won
t
even
have
to
keep
my
own
youngsters
if
there
should
be
any
i
don
t
like
the
way
they
house
you
here
if
i
stop
i
shall
insist
upon
living
in
a
small
house
apart
from
others
where
i
can
make
my
wife
feel
that
i
am
lord
and
master
in
it
the
men
here
seem
to
be
fools
they
let
the
women
grow
up
as
strong
and
healthy
as
themselves
and
it
will
be
difficult
to
reduce
them
to
civilization
again
isn
t
it
extraordinary
this
was
as
far
as
the
rollicking
augustus
had
progressed
in
his
narrative
and
i
was
quite
sincere
when
i
informed
him
that
i
thought
it
very
original
indeed
oh
i
say
you
have
got
your
hair
cut
he
cried
it
doesn
t
look
at
all
bad
but
when
you
get
back
to
england
you
will
wish
you
had
it
back
again
but
i
suppose
you
felt
that
you
must
be
in
the
fashion
it
s
a
mercy
for
women
that
they
are
at
least
capable
of
understanding
all
matters
appertaining
to
dress
otherwise
we
might
expect
them
to
bestow
less
attention
upon
our
own
personal
adornment
they
can
never
manufacture
anything
to
equal
men
s
work
but
i
will
grant
them
the
faculty
of
criticism
how
do
you
like
me
in
my
new
clothes
should
i
have
been
human
if
i
had
failed
to
retaliate
a
little
on
this
occasion
i
found
it
impossible
to
resist
the
temptation
and
replied
gravely
well
i
confess
that
i
was
rather
surprised
to
see
that
you
also
had
been
persuaded
to
adopt
the
national
costume
for
it
makes
you
look
more
insignificant
than
ever
if
possible
you
will
be
mistaken
for
some
little
boy
playing
the
truant
if
you
do
not
mind
but
i
daresay
my
presence
will
be
some
little
protection
to
you
and
you
are
sincerely
welcome
to
any
assistance
i
can
afford
you
come
if
that
isn
t
cool
interrupted
augustus
i
can
see
just
what
is
the
matter
you
are
jealous
of
me
all
round
because
i
am
naturally
of
more
consequence
than
you
are
and
because
you
have
no
hope
of
being
able
to
produce
half
such
a
book
as
mine
will
be
still
as
i
said
before
i
rather
like
you
and
we
may
as
well
be
friends
while
we
are
here
suppose
we
try
an
intellectual
topic
likely
to
prove
of
use
in
our
reminiscences
what
did
you
have
for
your
breakfast
i
m
afraid
that
if
i
had
met
in
former
days
i
should
scarcely
have
looked
upon
him
as
an
individual
with
whom
it
was
worth
my
while
to
waste
ten
minutes
in
conversation
and
my
chief
regret
now
was
that
new
amazonians
were
being
edified
by
the
nonentities
of
a
man
who
was
by
no
means
a
fair
specimen
of
the
sort
of
men
my
country
could
turn
out
not
that
such
conceited
individuals
do
not
exist
in
our
midst
for
i
know
some
one
at
this
moment
who
may
possibly
be
mistaken
for
the
prototype
of
the
lively
augustus
should
he
or
his
friends
read
this
i
wish
to
assure
them
that
above
all
things
i
disclaim
being
personal
it
is
not
quite
an
impossibility
to
find
two
individuals
equally
addicted
to
what
is
termed
fast
living
equally
boisterous
in
the
matter
of
dress
equally
conceited
and
overbearing
and
addicted
to
the
same
inane
forms
of
speech
they
may
therefore
console
themselves
with
the
idea
that
however
like
them
my
hero
may
be
the
resemblance
is
only
a
chance
one
the
further
progress
of
my
conversation
with
the
hon
augustus
would
not
amuse
the
reader
any
more
than
would
a
description
of
the
remaining
portion
of
that
morning
s
excursion
for
i
lost
all
interest
in
what
i
saw
and
my
return
to
the
college
took
place
much
earlier
than
i
had
intended
chapter
x
the
next
excursion
of
any
importance
which
i
made
was
in
the
company
of
principal
grey
who
proved
a
splendid
cicerone
inasmuch
as
she
spared
no
pains
to
explain
everything
which
presented
itself
to
me
in
a
puzzling
aspect
i
had
often
visited
different
european
countries
and
had
been
greatly
interested
by
many
things
i
saw
but
in
new
amazonia
the
constant
predominating
feeling
was
not
mere
interest
fancy
going
through
a
city
anywhere
in
europe
in
our
own
days
without
seeing
either
a
beggar
or
a
poverty
stricken
individual
of
any
sort
dirt
squalor
drunkenness
profane
language
sickness
rags
and
a
thousand
other
miseries
meet
us
at
every
turn
in
the
poorer
quarters
of
our
big
cities
but
not
one
of
these
things
did
i
note
in
new
amazonia
purity
peace
health
harmony
and
comfort
reigned
in
their
stead
and
presented
a
picture
such
as
i
had
never
hoped
to
gaze
upon
in
this
world
but
what
ultimately
struck
me
as
the
strangest
thing
i
had
yet
observed
was
the
fact
that
i
had
not
seen
a
single
old
woman
or
man
since
i
came
here
and
i
determined
to
appease
my
curiosity
on
the
subject
as
soon
as
possible
by
addressing
some
questions
to
principal
grey
how
is
it
that
i
have
seen
no
old
people
since
i
came
to
your
country
i
asked
is
it
because
you
keep
them
secluded
after
they
have
arrived
at
a
certain
age
or
because
you
die
comparatively
young
my
dear
woman
was
the
principal
s
reply
we
have
both
met
and
spoken
to
a
great
many
old
people
this
very
evening
do
you
mind
telling
me
what
you
call
old
age
perhaps
your
ideas
and
mine
on
the
subject
differ
well
i
replied
we
call
seventy
or
eighty
very
old
of
the
professor
looked
at
me
with
great
astonishment
seventy
or
eighty
she
exclaimed
why
how
old
do
you
take
me
to
be
had
it
been
an
ordinary
english
lady
who
had
asked
me
this
home
question
i
should
probably
have
hesitated
in
my
reply
but
this
was
a
being
who
despised
the
appellative
with
all
its
accompanying
affectations
and
prided
herself
upon
nothing
so
much
as
being
an
honest
truthful
candid
so
i
made
what
i
considered
to
be
a
fair
guess
and
replied
that
i
judged
her
age
to
be
about
forty
or
thereabouts
only
forty
was
the
disparaging
comment
upon
this
guess
i
am
very
glad
to
say
that
it
is
long
since
i
passed
that
baby
age
one
must
be
at
least
before
a
position
like
mine
is
attainable
i
have
occupied
my
present
post
for
now
you
are
asking
me
to
believe
too
much
i
expostulated
why
you
would
at
that
rate
be
eighty
years
old
at
the
very
least
and
you
have
not
even
the
suspicion
of
a
wrinkle
about
wrinkles
are
not
necessary
evils
i
was
told
we
prefer
to
do
without
them
and
seldom
see
them
in
real
life
though
we
are
familiar
enough
with
their
presentment
in
ancient
prints
my
actual
age
is
one
hundred
and
fourteen
years
and
i
hope
to
live
a
life
of
honourable
usefulness
for
many
years
to
come
without
losing
the
proud
consciousness
that
i
belong
to
a
race
of
beings
fashioned
and
developed
in
the
s
own
i
could
only
ejaculate
the
surprise
i
felt
at
this
startling
information
and
stammer
something
to
the
effect
that
i
had
never
before
seen
anyone
who
had
lived
a
whole
century
and
that
when
such
a
rare
thing
did
occur
in
my
country
it
was
considered
a
fit
occurrence
to
be
recorded
in
the
newspapers
can
you
tell
me
what
anyone
of
my
age
would
look
like
in
your
country
supposing
that
i
myself
were
one
of
you
and
had
reached
my
present
age
under
the
normal
conditions
which
govern
life
with
you
what
do
you
really
suppose
i
would
look
like
i
am
the
reverse
of
clever
with
my
pencil
but
the
picture
which
i
rapidly
sketched
would
in
my
opinion
have
proved
rather
flattering
than
otherwise
under
the
circumstances
indicated
by
the
principal
she
however
evidently
did
not
regard
it
in
that
light
for
she
looked
at
the
sketch
with
a
face
of
horror
and
repulsion
which
was
as
comical
to
me
as
it
was
evidently
real
what
a
frightful
country
to
live
in
she
exclaimed
if
everyone
who
has
attained
to
years
of
discretion
is
doomed
to
look
like
that
i
would
rather
pass
my
probation
with
the
spirits
than
endure
such
a
hideous
mockery
of
life
to
watch
the
gradual
decay
of
all
physical
beauty
must
be
an
almost
unendurable
there
you
are
mistaken
i
responded
somewhat
warmly
our
old
people
provided
they
have
by
an
honourable
and
useful
life
gained
the
respect
of
their
fellows
are
honoured
more
in
old
age
than
in
comparative
youth
it
is
true
that
the
eyesight
becomes
impaired
the
sense
of
hearing
fails
the
teeth
fall
out
the
appetite
becomes
dulled
strength
vanishes
and
the
gait
becomes
feeble
and
halting
but
it
is
also
true
that
in
most
cases
the
mental
faculties
are
simultaneously
affected
and
that
the
consciousness
of
physical
deterioration
therefore
fails
to
affect
our
old
people
as
powerfully
as
you
might
worse
and
worse
cried
the
principal
with
emphatic
conviction
it
seems
to
me
that
with
you
to
live
is
simply
to
be
fully
conscious
of
dying
no
new
amazonian
would
support
such
a
miserable
existence
for
a
day
i
for
one
would
at
once
resolve
to
disembody
myself
and
seek
final
glorification
in
a
less
trammelled
disembody
yourself
do
you
mean
that
you
would
commit
suicide
i
mean
that
my
body
should
cease
to
but
it
is
a
crime
to
take
the
life
god
gave
i
see
that
superstition
ranks
rife
with
you
we
should
consider
it
a
much
greater
crime
to
permit
a
grovelling
decaying
body
to
chain
the
spirit
to
earth
and
nothingness
than
to
sever
the
life
which
prevents
it
from
seeking
perfection
in
more
congenial
i
certainly
do
feel
lamentably
dense
and
ignorant
while
listening
to
you
i
can
not
for
instance
fathom
your
meaning
when
you
say
the
spirit
can
seek
perfection
after
the
spirit
never
dies
the
body
is
but
the
casing
in
which
the
spirit
is
given
its
greatest
opportunities
of
seeking
final
glorification
as
we
acquire
knowledge
of
every
kind
and
learn
more
and
more
to
fathom
the
secrets
which
nature
has
so
long
guarded
with
such
jealousy
so
much
nearer
shall
we
be
towards
the
ultimate
perfection
of
the
spirit
which
assimilates
most
nearly
to
herself
and
constitutes
our
ideal
of
final
bliss
after
the
death
of
our
material
form
we
still
strive
to
reach
our
desired
goal
but
our
progress
when
disembodied
is
not
so
rapid
as
while
still
inhabiting
our
earthly
casing
and
our
ultimate
arrival
at
the
zenith
of
wisdom
purity
and
bliss
in
other
words
heaven
may
be
delayed
for
ages
by
a
premature
exit
from
this
world
naturally
therefore
we
try
to
prolong
the
healthy
life
of
the
body
by
all
the
arts
in
our
power
knowing
that
it
is
given
us
as
a
special
means
of
attaining
heavenly
perfection
a
diseased
body
inevitably
affects
the
mind
and
prevents
it
from
soaring
upwards
therefore
we
argue
one
of
the
surest
ways
of
reaching
heaven
is
to
cultivate
the
health
and
perfection
of
the
body
if
this
material
part
of
us
therefore
falls
into
permanent
sickness
uselessness
and
decay
it
but
serves
to
trammel
the
spirit
and
hinder
its
further
advancement
this
we
are
not
inclined
to
tolerate
and
when
the
misfortune
of
physical
wreck
overtakes
any
of
us
we
liberate
the
spirit
without
any
wasteful
delay
a
certain
mineral
extract
added
to
an
ordinary
dose
of
schlafstrank
quietly
and
painlessly
disposes
of
our
physical
existence
and
sends
the
spirit
on
its
way
rejoicing
in
its
new
found
you
mean
that
what
we
call
chronic
invalidism
does
not
exist
among
you
simply
because
your
people
are
in
the
habit
of
killing
themselves
as
soon
as
health
leaves
them
it
is
one
way
of
escaping
earthly
troubles
but
are
there
not
some
exceedingly
painful
scenes
when
the
conviction
is
forced
home
to
anyone
that
it
is
becoming
necessary
to
do
this
do
you
feel
no
horror
of
the
passage
from
here
to
the
great
hereafter
why
should
we
a
sickly
body
is
no
fit
tenement
for
a
spirit
which
is
striving
for
allwisdom
and
deitic
purity
so
the
sooner
we
discard
it
the
sooner
we
reach
heaven
sometimes
we
are
sorry
to
leave
friends
behind
but
i
never
heard
anyone
who
felt
the
slightest
dread
of
severance
or
who
ever
hesitated
a
moment
as
to
the
ultimate
benefits
of
such
a
step
on
the
contrary
it
often
occurs
that
new
amazonians
are
inclined
to
discard
the
body
before
it
is
needful
or
expedient
to
do
so
we
therefore
do
not
sanction
until
our
physicians
and
surgeons
have
carefully
diagnosed
a
case
and
pronounced
their
opinion
on
it
if
there
is
any
chance
of
recovery
the
patient
is
subjected
to
the
influence
of
schlafstrank
and
eventually
awakens
cheerfully
prepared
to
make
a
sensible
use
of
the
respite
given
to
the
body
if
recovery
is
hopeless
the
patient
is
provided
with
mineralized
schlafstrank
and
at
once
cheerfully
relinquishes
all
hold
upon
but
suppose
the
subject
is
insane
what
is
done
then
ah
well
insanity
is
of
very
rare
occurrence
with
us
the
mother
takes
such
care
of
her
children
that
they
have
practically
no
anxieties
while
we
are
young
we
are
educated
and
cared
for
and
when
we
are
old
we
are
always
pensioned
off
and
do
not
need
to
labour
unless
we
choose
few
of
us
however
care
to
give
up
work
altogether
when
unfortunately
physical
influences
work
upon
the
mind
in
such
a
manner
as
to
produce
the
phenomenon
called
insanity
the
mother
at
once
relieves
the
spirit
of
the
ties
which
would
effectually
prevent
the
slightest
advancement
towards
the
great
kills
all
insane
persons
in
fact
yes
in
mercy
and
justice
to
and
what
is
your
theory
as
to
the
condition
of
insane
people
after
death
well
they
are
more
remotely
removed
from
the
state
which
entitles
us
to
the
bliss
of
living
in
unison
with
because
the
condition
of
the
body
has
prevented
them
from
acquiring
the
degree
of
perfection
which
can
be
reached
by
healthy
persons
but
it
is
only
a
question
of
time
and
degree
insanity
is
a
disease
of
the
brain
the
brain
is
essentially
material
release
the
spirit
from
this
gross
encasement
and
its
chances
of
ultimately
reaching
heaven
are
as
great
as
when
it
first
emanated
from
our
glorious
i
suppose
crime
is
occasionally
to
be
met
with
in
new
amazonia
sometimes
but
very
rarely
there
is
very
little
incentive
to
crime
here
when
it
does
occur
we
accept
it
as
an
indication
of
a
diseased
brain
and
forthwith
use
our
best
efforts
to
cure
the
disease
we
generally
succeed
in
doing
so
but
if
the
case
after
repeated
and
careful
doctoring
proves
incurable
of
course
the
ordinary
treatment
of
the
hopelessly
insane
is
but
do
you
feel
no
repulsion
at
the
idea
of
sending
a
soul
stained
with
crime
to
hell
hell
there
is
no
hell
that
is
an
old
superstition
of
the
ancients
at
which
i
have
often
after
that
i
am
prepared
to
hear
you
say
that
there
is
no
devil
most
certainly
i
do
say
so
i
have
read
of
the
most
extraordinary
beliefs
in
witchcraft
sorcery
and
the
possession
by
evil
spirits
to
which
all
nations
used
to
lend
themselves
it
was
said
that
they
were
perpetually
at
war
with
all
the
children
of
and
that
the
sole
purpose
of
their
existence
was
to
prevent
people
from
getting
to
heaven
our
great
god
whom
we
call
created
us
in
her
image
to
be
her
associates
as
soon
as
our
spirits
are
sufficiently
ennobled
and
purified
is
good
she
has
created
everything
she
loves
the
creatures
she
has
cast
in
her
own
image
she
would
not
deliberately
try
to
negative
her
own
work
by
creating
evil
spirits
to
harass
us
as
for
anything
being
at
deliberate
war
with
her
and
going
about
the
world
endeavouring
to
foil
her
plans
it
is
preposterous
to
believe
it
she
would
at
once
annihilate
anything
so
but
you
surely
do
not
believe
that
we
shall
all
good
and
evil
be
awarded
the
same
fate
after
death
no
i
do
not
have
i
not
already
tried
to
explain
this
to
you
our
earthly
career
is
our
training
school
if
we
take
advantage
of
all
our
opportunities
and
act
in
accordance
with
what
we
conceive
to
be
the
wishes
of
a
divine
and
beneficent
creator
we
may
hope
to
be
translated
to
ultimate
bliss
at
no
distant
period
after
the
death
of
our
bodies
but
if
we
deliberately
fail
to
travel
in
the
direction
of
steady
advancement
we
condemn
our
spirit
to
endure
ages
of
banishment
before
it
is
finally
sufficiently
purified
to
partake
of
the
happiness
which
is
the
portion
of
those
who
have
pierced
the
veil
of
ignorance
and
have
entered
the
kingdom
of
divine
and
beatitude
you
talk
of
a
place
called
hell
what
worse
punishment
can
be
needed
for
erring
souls
than
to
know
that
to
their
own
perversity
they
are
indebted
for
being
debarred
from
all
happiness
and
association
with
purer
spirits
for
ages
untold
one
more
question
we
believe
that
jesus
of
nazareth
was
sent
to
save
sinners
do
you
reject
that
doctrine
in
one
sense
yes
in
another
no
we
believe
that
from
time
to
time
our
creator
has
permitted
individual
beings
to
lead
such
pure
and
holy
lives
as
to
be
a
shining
example
to
others
and
a
stimulus
to
exertion
in
the
right
direction
jesus
of
nazareth
was
one
of
the
greatest
and
noblest
of
these
men
and
as
such
his
name
is
honoured
amongst
us
but
we
do
not
believe
that
the
creator
awarded
incalculable
suffering
to
one
creature
in
order
that
we
might
suffer
less
we
are
sentient
beings
and
are
expected
to
work
out
our
own
thus
far
principal
grey
had
been
very
patient
with
me
but
as
there
are
limits
even
to
new
amazonian
endurance
i
resolved
to
refrain
from
questioning
her
further
during
this
walk
and
bestowed
a
little
more
attention
upon
surrounding
objects
while
at
the
same
time
carefully
weighing
the
import
of
our
long
conversation
chapter
xi
it
was
not
long
however
before
my
train
of
thought
brought
me
back
to
the
old
groove
i
reflected
that
although
i
had
been
told
that
people
whose
energies
were
failing
generally
preferred
to
give
themselves
a
quietus
i
still
did
not
know
how
it
was
that
no
one
seemed
to
bear
any
of
the
usual
marks
of
age
i
could
hardly
believe
that
the
approach
of
a
wrinkle
or
a
slight
failing
in
any
given
direction
would
be
considered
a
sufficient
warning
to
put
an
end
to
earthly
troubles
and
yet
i
met
not
a
single
individual
who
looked
as
if
she
or
he
was
even
nearing
old
age
it
is
strange
i
said
at
last
that
everyone
here
seems
gifted
with
perpetual
youth
i
wish
you
would
explain
the
mystery
to
nothing
easier
she
rejoined
i
was
just
taking
you
to
see
one
of
our
most
important
buildings
follow
nothing
loath
and
with
my
curiosity
roused
to
the
very
apex
of
expectation
i
followed
my
guide
into
a
magnificent
building
which
we
had
approached
there
were
many
other
people
entering
at
the
same
time
and
more
careful
observation
convinced
me
that
none
of
them
looked
quite
as
bright
and
healthy
as
the
new
amazonians
with
whom
i
had
hitherto
associated
i
looked
enquiringly
at
principal
grey
she
did
but
smile
and
bid
me
be
seated
wait
awhile
she
said
and
you
shall
witness
a
being
deprived
of
the
necessity
for
action
for
a
time
yet
fully
appreciating
the
advantages
of
a
welcome
rest
i
made
diligent
use
of
my
eyes
and
marvelled
much
at
the
rugged
chaste
grandeur
of
the
building
which
principal
grey
told
me
was
the
andersonia
physiological
hall
there
was
a
marvellous
groined
roof
supported
by
equally
marvellous
granite
pillars
the
floor
was
tesselated
the
doors
of
massive
clamped
oak
and
the
windows
were
wonderful
dreams
of
the
s
art
the
splendid
staircase
which
led
from
the
central
hall
to
the
upper
storys
was
of
brilliant
white
marble
the
balusters
being
of
polished
red
granite
as
were
also
the
numerous
fluted
columns
which
supported
both
staircase
and
ceiling
the
whole
building
was
a
perfect
dream
of
taste
and
splendour
but
it
was
the
people
after
all
who
claimed
most
of
my
attention
it
seemed
to
me
that
those
who
entered
the
hall
and
passed
on
to
what
principal
grey
called
the
renewing
rooms
were
none
of
them
quite
so
vigorous
and
brisk
as
those
who
passed
us
on
their
return
and
yet
the
latter
all
seemed
to
have
grown
unaccountably
stouter
in
one
arm
which
they
carried
with
almost
wooden
stiffness
and
awkwardness
of
course
i
looked
my
enquiries
but
for
a
time
my
guide
and
entertainer
preferred
to
tantalise
me
by
refraining
from
explaining
the
mystery
which
puzzled
me
when
at
last
she
did
condescend
to
enlighten
my
ignorance
i
could
scarcely
restrain
my
incredulity
for
it
seemed
to
me
that
i
was
now
asked
to
believe
the
greatest
wonder
of
all
i
was
told
that
the
primary
purpose
of
this
building
was
to
afford
facilities
for
inoculating
the
aged
or
debilitated
with
the
nerves
of
young
and
vigorous
animals
and
that
this
was
the
explanation
of
the
fact
that
i
had
as
yet
seen
no
really
people
in
new
amazonia
we
all
resort
at
times
to
the
physiological
hall
for
recuperation
and
rejuvenation
said
my
companion
and
it
is
to
the
benefit
we
derive
here
that
much
of
our
national
prosperity
is
due
the
breeding
and
rearing
of
the
animals
required
is
an
expensive
branch
of
state
economy
but
all
expenses
are
more
than
counterbalanced
by
the
fees
which
we
willingly
pay
for
each
operation
even
apart
from
the
fact
that
we
are
individually
and
collectively
enormously
benefitted
by
our
rejuvenating
system
it
gives
employment
to
a
large
number
of
people
and
adds
considerably
to
the
revenues
of
the
and
since
when
has
the
system
been
in
vogue
i
asked
deeply
interested
only
within
the
last
four
hundred
years
although
it
is
on
reliable
record
that
experiments
in
that
direction
were
inaugurated
by
professor
in
the
nineteenth
century
but
in
those
days
the
human
race
was
only
just
awakening
to
a
knowledge
of
the
benefits
and
beauties
of
science
and
it
remained
for
posterity
to
recognise
the
full
value
of
professor
s
invention
do
you
observe
that
marble
statue
extending
the
right
hand
in
kindly
welcome
to
all
who
enter
this
building
yes
i
noticed
it
on
entering
it
is
a
splendid
not
more
splendid
than
the
genius
of
the
man
it
is
intended
to
personify
it
is
a
memorial
statue
of
the
inventor
of
it
is
essentially
idealistic
as
no
counterfeit
presentment
of
has
been
preserved
for
the
admiration
of
future
ages
but
as
every
statue
in
his
honour
is
reproduced
in
the
likeness
of
this
one
we
are
all
familiar
with
what
is
supposed
to
be
his
presentment
just
as
even
in
days
of
old
everyone
recognised
the
portrait
of
christ
the
martyr
when
they
saw
i
got
up
to
inspect
the
statue
more
closely
for
i
had
a
sort
of
interest
in
the
original
i
had
once
met
a
gentleman
who
had
attended
his
initiatory
lecture
in
paris
on
the
art
of
not
growing
i
was
sure
however
that
the
professor
would
never
recognise
himself
here
for
the
statue
was
idealised
into
the
presentment
of
a
beneficent
powerful
godlike
form
which
was
as
devoid
of
all
gallic
characteristics
as
it
was
beautiful
in
conception
i
refrained
however
from
insinuating
that
this
was
the
reverse
of
a
true
likeness
and
contented
myself
with
praising
the
thing
as
a
work
of
art
and
who
is
your
sculptor
i
enquired
admiringly
bernard
o
i
thought
men
were
excluded
from
sharing
artistic
and
scientific
pursuits
with
you
by
no
means
some
of
our
most
famous
professors
are
men
and
the
lectureships
are
open
to
all
who
can
head
the
list
in
our
annual
competitions
the
chief
governmental
offices
are
all
appropriated
by
women
in
sheer
in
the
first
instance
and
later
on
because
the
world
s
experience
goes
to
prove
that
masculine
government
has
always
held
openings
for
the
free
admission
of
corruption
injustice
immorality
and
bigotry
the
purity
and
wisdom
of
new
amazonian
government
is
proverbial
and
we
know
better
than
to
admit
the
possibility
of
retrogression
by
permitting
male
governance
again
nevertheless
we
are
not
disposed
to
be
ourselves
by
way
of
avenging
past
oppression
our
tribunes
privy
councillors
prime
advisers
and
leader
are
always
women
but
with
respect
to
everything
else
the
sexes
stand
on
an
equal
footing
both
women
and
men
who
have
attained
the
age
of
being
privileged
to
vote
at
all
and
in
the
case
of
married
people
which
is
supposed
to
be
the
head
of
the
household
whichever
of
the
two
happens
to
be
best
qualified
to
direct
domestic
affairs
with
the
greatest
wisdom
our
tenets
preach
equality
in
the
married
state
and
as
people
of
uncongenial
temperament
have
no
trouble
in
obtaining
a
divorce
it
is
seldom
that
serious
marital
disturbances
are
heard
of
the
mere
knowledge
that
marriage
is
a
civil
compact
which
may
almost
be
dissolved
at
will
serves
to
restrain
violent
ebullitions
of
temper
as
a
rule
our
divorcees
are
very
good
friends
after
their
marriage
has
been
judicially
still
domestic
involvements
of
this
sort
must
serve
to
distract
the
attention
from
serious
duties
and
reduce
individual
capability
of
taking
an
active
part
in
public
your
deduction
is
perfectly
logical
but
has
no
foundation
in
fact
for
this
permit
no
one
to
be
elected
for
state
offices
who
has
ever
been
married
nor
are
important
professorial
posts
accessible
by
them
although
trade
agencies
and
countless
minor
offices
are
open
to
them
the
result
of
this
policy
is
manifold
our
population
scarcely
increases
at
all
and
the
necessity
of
emigration
which
is
practised
by
less
moral
and
more
prolific
nations
does
not
even
loom
in
the
distant
future
for
us
we
have
no
great
dearth
of
resources
to
face
nor
have
we
to
battle
with
the
incalculable
evils
forced
upon
other
states
by
our
laws
and
social
economy
hold
out
wonderful
premiums
for
chastity
and
the
result
is
that
all
our
most
intellectual
compatriots
especially
the
women
prefer
honour
and
advancement
to
the
more
animal
pleasures
of
marriage
and
of
am
i
to
understand
from
this
that
you
do
not
hold
the
condition
of
motherhood
in
honour
by
no
means
if
you
will
take
careful
note
of
your
surroundings
ere
you
leave
us
you
will
see
that
as
much
public
homage
is
paid
to
married
women
as
to
single
ones
but
we
believe
that
perfect
clearness
of
brain
and
the
ability
to
devote
oneself
exclusively
to
intellectual
topics
are
inseparable
from
the
celibate
state
and
we
adhere
rigidly
to
the
rules
established
in
connection
with
this
it
must
i
suppose
be
impossible
even
here
to
escape
some
taint
of
immorality
for
instance
it
must
be
a
great
temptation
to
many
people
to
keep
themselves
eligible
for
election
by
remaining
single
and
yet
to
indulge
secretly
in
carnal
propensities
how
do
you
act
in
the
case
of
illegitimate
children
illegitimate
children
are
an
almost
unheard
of
phenomenon
here
we
do
not
tolerate
vice
and
our
punishments
usually
prove
adequate
deterrents
a
woman
found
guilty
of
adultery
is
at
once
degraded
and
never
attains
to
any
other
position
than
that
of
the
lowest
menial
in
one
of
our
public
and
what
of
the
man
he
is
allowed
to
go
with
us
is
it
so
with
you
no
man
who
has
once
offended
in
that
direction
ever
has
the
opportunity
of
repeating
his
crime
in
new
amazonia
for
he
is
at
once
bereft
of
all
he
possesses
and
banished
from
the
country
not
only
does
he
lose
all
present
possessions
but
forfeits
the
pension
he
would
otherwise
enjoy
in
his
old
age
he
is
not
permitted
to
return
to
the
then
your
punishment
of
the
man
is
infinitely
the
most
severe
yes
it
is
long
since
we
recognised
the
necessity
of
repressing
vice
by
other
methods
than
our
forerunners
and
what
are
your
laws
in
relation
to
the
legal
and
moral
rights
of
illegitimates
we
have
no
laws
on
the
subject
simply
because
the
offspring
of
vice
is
not
permitted
to
live
we
new
amazonians
pride
ourselves
upon
being
of
none
but
honourable
this
information
was
delivered
in
such
a
calm
and
tone
that
i
involuntarily
shuddered
and
hastened
to
change
the
subject
do
you
think
i
could
witness
an
operation
in
that
inner
room
without
feeling
specially
horrified
i
asked
next
you
shall
yourself
be
operated
upon
if
you
will
replied
principal
grey
you
are
a
guest
of
the
mother
and
will
have
no
fees
to
pay
but
you
will
derive
wonderful
benefit
i
wish
to
be
operated
upon
myself
and
we
will
go
in
but
stay
one
moment
did
you
not
say
that
people
were
inoculated
at
the
expense
of
young
animals
whose
nerves
are
used
to
rejuvenate
their
tormentors
i
can
not
possibly
go
in
there
and
face
vivisectional
cruelties
to
see
the
poor
brutes
writhe
in
tortured
agony
to
witness
the
fearful
rolling
of
their
glaring
eyeballs
to
listen
to
their
despairing
cries
and
groans
in
order
that
i
may
benefit
by
their
sufferings
is
an
ordeal
i
can
not
go
through
i
will
wait
here
until
you
have
been
inoculated
but
i
can
not
go
nonsense
my
dear
woman
smiled
the
principal
you
are
talking
with
no
more
perception
of
the
advancement
of
science
than
if
you
really
lived
in
that
nineteenth
century
to
which
you
so
oddly
claim
to
belong
the
animals
do
not
suffer
one
little
bit
as
you
will
see
when
you
go
into
the
renewing
long
ago
a
german
chemist
invented
a
wonderful
ether
which
he
called
it
had
the
power
of
instantaneously
arresting
sense
and
motion
perfect
unconsciousness
was
produced
with
electrical
rapidity
and
the
clever
chemist
expected
to
earn
his
country
s
gratitude
for
his
marvellous
discovery
but
in
those
days
governments
were
exceedingly
and
the
german
government
was
so
struck
with
the
remarkable
powers
for
harm
which
the
new
discovery
possessed
that
it
ignored
all
its
beneficial
qualities
and
actually
forbade
the
chemist
to
manufacture
bändiger
in
future
happily
he
was
more
enlightened
than
his
rulers
and
not
merely
did
his
best
to
improve
upon
his
invention
but
left
careful
instructions
to
his
successors
relating
to
its
manufacture
many
years
after
this
a
miniature
revolver
was
invented
which
instead
of
cartridges
was
charged
with
minute
cells
of
these
bändiger
revolvers
were
subsequently
manufactured
in
large
quantities
in
america
and
as
the
state
monopolised
the
manufacture
and
charged
high
prices
for
every
weapon
besides
exacting
a
heavy
tax
for
the
privilege
of
using
them
they
proved
a
very
profitable
monopoly
from
america
their
use
spread
to
india
where
they
were
speedily
efficacious
in
ridding
the
country
of
the
countless
numbers
of
wild
beasts
which
annually
slaughtered
a
great
proportion
of
the
population
the
bändiger
does
not
kill
it
only
stuns
instantaneously
the
effect
lasting
long
enough
to
enable
us
to
kill
outright
or
to
make
such
experiments
as
are
required
in
the
interests
of
science
and
progress
an
animal
once
subjected
to
its
influence
feels
no
more
pain
for
it
is
absolutely
unconscious
during
all
subsequent
operations
and
if
it
has
been
too
much
cut
up
to
recover
easily
it
is
at
once
killed
if
not
the
administration
of
schlafstrank
enables
it
to
recuperate
painlessly
and
be
available
for
future
this
bändiger
is
really
a
frightful
power
does
it
never
happen
that
crime
is
committed
by
its
aid
never
nobody
ever
has
the
handling
of
a
bändiger
revolver
except
our
duly
qualified
and
licensed
surgeons
and
they
would
not
imperil
their
future
existence
and
prosperity
by
stupid
indulgence
in
a
senseless
freak
but
come
we
must
now
go
in
or
the
rooms
will
be
closed
for
the
this
time
i
was
not
reluctant
to
follow
the
principal
and
i
was
very
agreeably
surprised
on
entering
the
renewing
my
mind
s
eye
had
conjured
a
vision
of
gory
disorder
the
central
figure
of
which
was
the
quivering
and
bleeding
body
of
some
unhappy
animal
and
the
prominent
accessories
some
brawny
and
surgeons
whose
perspiring
brows
hands
and
callous
cruelty
of
expression
would
be
anything
but
reassuring
to
the
trembling
and
expectant
human
beings
waiting
to
be
inoculated
what
i
really
saw
was
this
the
room
to
which
an
attendant
conducted
us
was
richly
carpeted
and
furnished
with
oriental
luxuriousness
every
accessory
to
comfort
was
there
and
several
people
were
either
standing
talking
in
animated
groups
or
lounging
on
the
spacious
cushioned
chairs
and
settees
some
were
reading
some
sipping
coffee
some
playing
with
some
beautiful
dogs
that
basked
in
front
of
the
fire
a
few
were
busy
at
needlework
but
all
seemed
thoroughly
at
home
there
were
several
tables
laden
with
prints
and
papers
a
magnificent
bookcase
occupied
one
end
of
the
room
the
walls
were
panelled
in
bird
maple
and
decorated
with
beautiful
pictures
all
photographed
in
their
natural
colours
which
stood
out
as
vivid
and
brilliant
as
in
an
oil
painting
the
operating
surgeons
were
six
in
of
them
being
women
two
men
they
were
all
handsome
of
splendid
physique
elegantly
dressed
and
of
dignified
yet
gentle
and
calm
demeanour
not
a
bit
like
the
ogres
my
excited
fancy
had
pictured
in
one
of
the
window
recesses
was
a
sort
of
bassinette
in
which
a
large
dog
lay
motionless
and
apparently
sleeping
with
a
screen
partially
hiding
him
from
observation
to
this
dog
the
surgeons
journeyed
before
attacking
the
bared
arm
of
the
individual
to
be
operated
upon
in
an
incredibly
short
time
the
task
of
inoculation
was
performed
the
people
hardly
ceasing
their
pleasant
hum
of
conversation
the
while
then
the
arm
was
tightly
bandaged
and
the
patient
went
on
her
or
his
way
rejoicing
after
paying
the
necessary
fees
to
an
official
whose
duty
it
was
to
receive
them
in
an
presently
an
was
rung
two
attendants
entered
the
room
pushed
the
bassinette
through
a
door
at
one
side
of
the
window
and
drew
an
empty
one
from
an
opening
at
the
other
side
then
one
of
the
dogs
was
coaxed
from
the
hearth
and
given
a
dainty
and
appetising
meal
afterwards
springing
upon
the
bassinette
to
enjoy
a
quiet
nap
after
his
good
dinner
in
another
second
the
bändiger
had
done
its
work
and
in
a
few
minutes
more
some
of
the
dog
s
nerve
force
was
being
transferred
to
my
own
arm
the
sensation
i
experienced
was
little
more
than
a
pinprick
in
intensity
but
before
i
left
the
building
with
principal
grey
i
felt
ten
years
younger
and
stronger
and
was
proportionately
elated
at
my
good
fortune
chapter
xii
a
subsequent
conversation
i
had
with
principal
grey
also
struck
me
as
so
noteworthy
that
i
jotted
the
particulars
of
it
down
without
delay
for
the
benefit
of
possible
future
english
readers
i
had
observed
that
although
there
were
plenty
of
people
dressed
with
distinctive
badges
and
colours
whose
function
it
was
to
preserve
order
and
regulate
the
traffic
as
the
policemen
do
with
us
i
saw
none
whom
i
could
assume
to
be
soldiers
and
made
enquiries
on
the
subject
i
was
told
that
standing
armies
were
seldom
maintained
now
as
it
was
no
longer
the
custom
of
nations
to
decimate
each
other
by
public
slaughter
but
to
trust
to
a
system
of
international
arbitration
in
the
event
of
quarrels
arising
nevertheless
as
new
amazonia
was
a
temptingly
wealthy
state
thanks
to
its
perfect
financial
organisation
there
was
a
possibility
of
invasion
and
great
care
had
been
lavished
upon
its
fortifications
which
when
manned
or
womaned
with
trained
warriors
were
all
but
impregnable
then
i
said
you
do
possess
a
trained
army
after
all
in
one
sense
yes
but
not
in
the
sense
you
mean
we
are
all
trained
to
fight
and
there
is
not
a
woman
or
man
in
the
country
who
does
not
thoroughly
understand
military
discipline
our
training
begins
in
infancy
and
includes
riding
shooting
swimming
diving
ballooning
and
every
possible
military
exercise
in
time
of
war
we
should
all
receive
remuneration
commensurate
with
what
we
realise
by
the
aid
of
our
ordinary
avocations
an
additional
third
our
discipline
is
severe
but
we
glory
in
it
and
all
new
amazonia
could
be
ready
for
action
within
an
hour
a
few
foolhardy
attempts
to
vanquish
us
have
been
made
but
our
foes
suffered
so
severely
that
we
are
scarcely
likely
to
be
molested
again
still
our
vigilance
is
never
relaxed
and
our
cordon
of
sentries
is
so
perfect
and
efficient
that
not
even
one
stranger
can
intrude
here
without
being
speedily
discovered
these
sentries
perform
a
double
duty
for
they
effectually
prevent
all
attempts
to
either
import
or
export
any
goods
that
have
not
yielded
their
due
proportion
of
profit
to
the
then
new
amazonians
can
not
claim
exemption
from
the
temptation
to
smuggle
no
and
yes
such
attempts
used
to
be
frequent
in
bygone
days
but
the
punishment
for
smuggling
is
so
severe
and
immunity
from
detection
so
problematical
that
the
vice
is
almost
stamped
and
what
is
the
punishment
meted
to
offenders
in
this
direction
foreigners
are
publicly
whipped
and
expelled
their
goods
new
amazonians
are
deprived
of
civil
rights
and
relegated
to
inferior
bad
enough
i
soliloquised
and
now
there
is
another
thing
which
puzzles
me
somewhat
what
with
war
seafaring
and
a
thousand
accidents
to
which
men
are
more
exposed
than
women
so
many
male
lives
are
lost
in
my
country
that
the
feminine
element
predominates
everywhere
just
as
it
seems
to
have
done
in
when
the
project
of
ireland
was
first
mooted
is
there
a
tendency
in
this
direction
with
you
now
and
if
so
do
you
take
steps
to
counteract
it
we
have
devoted
much
thought
to
the
subject
and
have
come
to
the
conclusion
that
even
where
all
the
causes
of
masculine
extinction
which
you
have
named
are
absent
then
is
still
a
tendency
for
women
to
outnumber
men
this
is
easily
accounted
for
very
few
children
die
with
us
in
infancy
but
it
is
a
fact
that
boys
succumb
more
easily
to
infantile
disorders
than
girls
we
desire
to
preserve
an
equality
of
the
sexes
nevertheless
and
perfect
physiological
knowledge
enables
us
to
solve
this
problem
as
we
have
done
many
others
which
the
ancients
deemed
i
notice
that
all
your
people
are
magnificently
formed
but
you
must
be
subject
to
certain
ailments
toothache
for
instance
which
is
a
perfect
scourge
with
that
is
a
phenomenon
to
which
we
are
here
quite
strange
i
am
glad
to
say
we
would
as
soon
expect
our
skulls
to
become
diseased
as
to
see
our
teeth
decay
we
know
the
exact
chemical
constituents
of
bone
and
are
careful
to
supply
the
constitution
with
perfect
food
we
also
avoid
everything
that
has
been
proved
to
be
an
injurious
article
of
but
individual
temptation
must
sometimes
break
through
this
rule
of
abstinence
it
can
not
no
sooner
is
anything
condemned
by
the
mother
than
its
importation
or
manufacture
is
strictly
forbidden
and
that
particular
article
is
soon
unobtainable
in
the
i
suppose
malformed
or
crippled
children
are
occasionally
brought
into
the
world
even
here
what
becomes
of
them
they
are
at
once
sent
to
spend
their
term
of
probation
in
less
material
now
in
relation
to
love
matters
with
which
sex
rests
the
onus
of
proposing
marriage
with
either
sex
of
course
i
do
not
see
how
it
could
be
it
is
very
much
otherwise
with
us
a
woman
may
be
dying
for
love
but
she
is
not
supposed
to
betray
the
fact
to
anyone
until
the
object
of
her
desires
intimates
that
he
has
set
his
affections
upon
but
suppose
that
he
intimates
no
such
thing
do
you
mean
to
say
that
she
is
not
even
then
to
express
her
preference
then
less
than
ever
the
object
of
her
affections
would
not
think
her
worth
having
if
she
were
won
too
easily
even
if
he
wanted
her
if
he
did
not
want
her
he
would
most
probably
sneer
about
her
condition
to
all
his
acquaintances
and
they
would
be
highly
amused
at
her
unwomanliness
in
presuming
to
love
before
she
had
been
well
i
do
not
envy
you
your
social
institutions
it
seems
to
me
that
your
men
must
be
insufferable
cads
and
your
women
nothing
less
than
fools
why
do
they
permit
such
an
anomalous
state
of
things
can
they
not
see
that
this
is
only
another
of
the
countless
meshes
with
which
masculine
egotism
has
woven
the
net
of
slavery
and
oppression
the
man
who
can
look
upon
a
true
woman
s
love
for
himself
with
anything
but
respect
and
grateful
sympathy
is
nothing
better
than
a
cur
who
is
himself
unworthy
of
the
esteem
of
all
honourable
the
principal
spoke
with
considerable
warmth
and
i
was
so
struck
with
the
force
of
her
remarks
that
i
promised
to
lay
her
views
before
my
own
countrywomen
at
no
distant
date
i
had
however
not
much
confidence
in
the
efficacy
of
any
appeal
i
might
make
to
womanly
pride
seeing
that
so
little
has
yet
been
done
in
england
to
induce
women
to
think
and
act
for
themselves
and
to
endeavour
to
break
through
the
multitude
of
social
barriers
which
have
been
erected
by
man
s
selfishness
tyranny
and
arrogance
still
it
has
often
happened
that
the
absurdity
of
a
custom
has
only
needed
to
be
demonstrated
in
black
and
white
for
its
doom
to
be
sealed
and
i
introduce
this
subject
to
the
notice
of
my
countrywomen
in
the
hope
that
it
may
induce
some
of
them
to
bestow
a
little
more
thought
upon
the
anomalies
of
their
position
and
use
their
best
endeavours
to
remove
at
least
some
of
the
partially
disabilities
they
suffer
from
by
way
of
diverting
the
principal
s
attention
from
a
subject
which
aroused
both
her
anger
and
contempt
i
remarked
upon
the
delightful
purity
of
the
atmosphere
here
and
opined
that
infectious
diseases
could
not
be
very
prevalent
we
have
heard
of
such
evils
was
the
reply
but
science
and
common
sense
united
have
combated
them
effectually
two
of
our
finest
statues
are
in
honour
of
a
couple
of
scientists
who
must
be
ranked
amongst
the
most
famous
benefactors
of
their
kind
who
have
ever
lived
i
allude
to
koch
and
pasteur
whose
discoveries
inaugurated
a
happy
era
of
immunity
from
disorders
which
once
killed
thousands
of
human
beings
annually
unfortunately
for
their
contemporaries
the
world
at
large
looked
upon
their
discoveries
as
only
interesting
from
the
scientists
point
of
view
failing
to
recognise
the
fact
that
a
gigantic
revolution
in
medicine
was
impending
in
some
of
our
archives
mention
is
made
of
a
austin
flint
who
asserted
that
such
a
revolution
was
not
far
off
but
his
utterances
fell
on
ears
that
were
mostly
deaf
or
unheeding
and
yet
to
the
discovery
and
study
of
bacteria
the
most
incalculable
benefits
to
the
human
race
are
to
be
attributed
so
perfect
has
the
knowledge
on
this
subject
now
become
that
the
cause
of
every
infectious
disease
is
well
known
they
are
all
easily
preventible
but
where
through
possible
slight
relaxation
of
watchfulness
they
may
break
out
they
are
so
easily
curable
as
to
cause
no
alarm
it
is
however
many
years
since
a
case
of
infectious
disease
occurred
in
new
amazonia
science
has
succeeded
in
affording
us
absolute
protection
against
scarlet
fever
measles
yellow
fever
cholera
whooping
cough
and
many
other
dreadful
ailments
which
formerly
decimated
naturally
i
was
very
much
interested
in
all
these
statements
and
our
conversation
branched
into
various
departments
of
the
curative
art
i
was
considerably
amused
by
principal
grey
s
information
relative
to
the
dietetic
hospital
as
fine
a
building
as
any
i
had
yet
noticed
in
andersonia
the
patients
in
this
hospital
were
nearly
all
people
in
physical
health
and
they
pursued
their
ordinary
daily
avocations
with
a
cheerfulness
which
i
had
never
before
observed
in
an
institution
patronised
solely
for
its
curative
properties
the
dietists
as
they
were
called
resorted
to
this
hospital
in
search
of
cures
for
mental
and
moral
failings
and
implicitly
obeyed
the
specialists
who
sought
to
effect
their
cure
by
means
of
a
wise
and
judicious
selection
of
food
thus
the
violent
tempered
found
their
nature
considerably
modified
and
sweetened
after
being
for
a
few
months
subjected
to
a
daily
diet
in
which
a
peculiarly
prepared
was
the
de
nervous
disorders
were
very
few
here
but
the
slightest
suspicion
of
a
tendency
to
be
nervous
or
fidgety
was
provocative
of
a
temporary
flight
to
the
hospital
which
owing
to
the
speed
and
cheapness
of
the
was
easily
accessible
to
every
denizen
of
the
island
green
peas
and
scarlet
runners
were
prohibited
to
those
whose
natural
tendencies
ran
in
a
choleric
direction
since
they
were
held
to
be
provocative
of
violent
temper
on
the
other
hand
dried
peas
and
lentils
were
high
in
favour
as
they
were
said
to
impart
good
humour
the
fat
and
frivolous
were
dieted
partially
on
turnips
in
order
to
curtail
their
physical
tendency
to
ponderosity
and
their
mental
leaning
towards
superabundance
of
spirits
to
cabbage
a
thousand
virtues
were
ascribed
and
the
idea
that
the
consumption
of
animal
food
produced
coarseness
of
mind
and
body
was
responsible
in
great
measure
for
the
disgust
with
which
the
foreign
habit
of
was
regarded
knowing
what
i
now
did
of
the
peculiar
religious
beliefs
of
new
amazonians
i
could
easily
conceive
that
the
most
scrupulous
attention
would
be
paid
to
dietetic
and
sanitary
matters
since
a
healthy
body
was
supposed
to
facilitate
the
perfecting
of
the
spirit
and
its
final
glorification
the
importance
attached
to
diet
and
sanitation
reminded
me
forcibly
of
the
old
mosaic
laws
and
i
enquired
if
great
importance
was
attached
to
the
testamentary
records
of
ancient
history
handed
down
to
us
in
the
bible
certainly
replied
the
principal
very
emphatically
but
we
also
heed
herodotus
and
josephus
and
our
greatest
classical
work
on
ancient
history
has
been
compiled
by
twelve
new
amazonian
savants
who
compared
all
records
with
such
strict
impartiality
and
absence
of
special
bias
that
we
flatter
ourselves
upon
possessing
the
most
accurate
and
reliable
records
of
ancient
history
but
you
surely
reverence
the
bible
yes
we
reverence
it
most
assuredly
but
where
historical
accuracy
seems
to
be
slightly
at
fault
we
are
not
above
being
instructed
from
other
then
what
do
you
think
of
moses
as
a
historian
as
a
and
as
a
general
in
all
these
respects
we
think
that
he
was
truly
great
but
being
human
it
was
not
impossible
for
him
to
adopt
an
erroneous
opinion
on
a
given
subject
or
to
commit
a
grave
error
of
judgment
many
things
for
which
we
can
now
find
natural
explanations
must
have
seemed
miraculous
in
his
days
and
in
no
case
do
we
believe
that
he
placed
anything
on
record
which
he
did
not
believe
to
be
exactly
as
he
described
it
still
this
does
not
prevent
us
from
recognising
some
errors
in
his
accounts
of
the
doings
in
former
times
that
he
forsook
the
precincts
of
a
court
in
order
to
cast
in
his
lot
with
his
own
downtrodden
and
oppressed
people
is
proof
sufficient
of
his
innate
nobility
and
his
fearless
defence
of
the
israelitish
labourers
showed
that
he
had
also
plenty
of
the
courage
required
in
a
great
and
what
of
david
king
david
does
not
arouse
my
personal
estimation
he
attained
to
great
eminence
and
founded
a
family
which
boasted
as
its
scion
christ
the
martyr
himself
he
also
wrote
some
beautiful
poetry
but
when
it
comes
to
an
analysis
of
private
character
he
does
not
shine
greatly
naturally
however
the
jews
whose
national
prestige
he
increased
so
materially
think
very
highly
of
him
upon
the
whole
we
prefer
the
new
testament
to
the
old
for
the
sake
of
its
beautiful
moral
teachings
as
well
as
for
its
historical
you
do
not
adhere
to
all
its
commandments
no
it
would
be
ill
for
us
if
we
did
never
to
speak
in
an
assembly
to
be
compelled
to
carry
a
great
weight
of
hair
about
with
us
to
be
subservient
to
men
in
all
things
and
to
foster
woman
s
disabilities
and
man
s
arrogance
to
the
extent
preached
by
some
of
the
apostles
is
repugnant
to
the
common
sense
of
every
woman
who
is
able
to
think
for
herself
but
when
we
come
across
anything
that
is
offensive
to
our
we
make
due
allowances
for
the
egotism
of
man
and
the
customs
of
the
times
we
also
remember
that
jesus
always
showed
himself
to
be
woman
s
true
friend
and
associate
in
fact
jesus
is
the
one
pure
and
shining
light
which
the
world
has
produced
of
whom
it
can
truly
be
said
that
he
was
free
from
all
trace
of
egotism
bigotry
and
arrogance
his
every
word
and
action
bespoke
the
possession
of
that
divine
charity
which
thinketh
no
evil
no
wonder
that
even
yet
he
is
by
many
regarded
as
god
himself
surely
his
spirit
would
pass
to
eternal
glory
without
any
of
the
probation
which
we
expect
to
endure
before
we
reach
the
perfection
which
shall
entitle
us
to
dwell
in
the
uttermost
realms
of
and
yet
there
must
be
many
beautiful
natures
in
so
happy
a
land
as
i
grant
it
but
the
nature
that
can
avoid
sullying
the
soul
with
wrongdoing
in
these
enlightened
days
can
not
compare
with
the
purity
and
goodness
of
a
soul
which
walked
unstained
through
life
in
the
days
of
bigotry
superstition
and
that
is
true
but
if
we
accept
this
opinion
we
must
also
accept
its
natural
correlative
and
consider
that
the
sinner
of
is
more
blameworthy
than
those
who
sinned
when
to
be
good
was
not
so
easy
as
it
is
few
will
dispute
that
point
with
you
but
it
becomes
necessary
for
me
to
remind
you
now
that
unpunctuality
and
neglect
of
duty
are
grave
sins
with
us
you
will
therefore
excuse
me
for
a
time
since
it
becomes
necessary
for
me
to
address
the
students
in
a
few
minutes
from
i
felt
rebuked
for
my
presumption
in
encroaching
so
much
upon
the
principal
s
time
but
she
was
so
very
and
so
exceedingly
willing
to
gratify
my
curiosity
that
i
was
tempted
to
trespass
upon
her
indulgence
being
urged
thereto
by
a
sense
of
unreality
and
a
conviction
that
my
stay
in
new
amazonia
would
terminate
as
suddenly
and
as
mysteriously
as
it
had
begun
it
was
natural
therefore
that
i
should
wish
to
post
myself
up
in
all
the
information
obtainable
during
my
sojourn
here
chapter
xiii
a
few
hours
later
i
was
honoured
by
a
most
embarrassing
request
i
say
honoured
because
the
request
was
the
outcome
of
a
desire
to
pay
due
attention
to
a
visitor
who
possessed
a
good
passport
to
new
amazonian
favour
in
that
she
took
an
intelligent
interest
in
her
surroundings
if
i
add
that
my
diminutive
stature
curious
appearance
and
mysterious
mode
of
arrival
had
somewhat
tickled
the
national
vein
of
curiosity
i
shall
not
be
far
wrong
the
service
required
of
me
was
to
make
a
public
speech
in
which
i
was
asked
to
give
a
slight
account
of
the
manners
and
customs
of
my
own
country
as
well
as
the
best
explanation
i
could
give
of
my
journey
hither
and
my
mode
of
eluding
the
coastguard
no
doubt
many
of
my
readers
may
think
that
such
a
request
would
not
have
embarrassed
them
they
could
have
talked
glibly
enough
and
would
have
felt
quite
comfortable
when
addressing
the
audience
which
intended
to
listen
to
my
feeble
utterances
as
for
giving
a
succinct
account
of
the
journey
they
could
have
invented
on
the
spot
so
marvellous
a
recital
as
would
have
excited
the
wonderment
of
every
new
amazonian
i
am
quite
willing
to
admit
that
to
these
clever
individuals
the
forthcoming
meeting
would
have
presented
no
terrors
but
they
may
possibly
comprehend
my
feelings
when
i
tell
them
that
i
had
never
lectured
or
made
a
speech
before
a
large
audience
in
my
life
and
yet
here
was
i
expected
to
pose
my
insignificant
self
upon
a
public
platform
and
address
a
crowded
meeting
at
an
hour
s
notice
conscious
all
the
time
that
thousands
of
people
were
criticising
my
odd
appearance
and
diction
it
certainly
was
no
small
ordeal
for
me
to
face
and
i
am
not
at
all
sure
that
my
trepidation
was
lessened
by
the
information
that
the
honourable
augustus
was
also
going
to
give
a
recital
of
his
adventures
to
be
honest
i
was
not
proud
of
his
ability
and
i
was
rather
afraid
lest
he
should
allow
himself
to
be
carried
away
by
his
insular
as
well
as
by
his
masculine
conceit
and
bring
ridicule
upon
both
of
us
for
although
we
knew
nothing
of
each
other
s
antecedents
it
was
inevitable
that
we
should
be
coupled
together
in
the
minds
of
new
amazonians
who
had
never
met
with
our
like
before
myra
was
solicitous
that
i
should
look
my
very
best
and
save
for
the
sash
which
aliens
were
not
permitted
to
wear
i
was
as
gay
as
any
unofficial
native
who
would
be
present
my
escort
was
a
large
one
it
seemed
to
me
that
all
the
college
was
going
and
long
before
we
entered
the
magnificent
hall
of
discussion
in
which
i
was
to
pose
as
one
of
the
central
figures
i
had
come
to
the
conclusion
that
everybody
else
in
andersonia
was
bound
for
the
same
place
i
do
believe
that
the
hall
is
going
to
prove
too
small
remarked
myra
as
we
gained
the
entrance
where
a
large
crowd
was
endeavouring
to
obtain
an
early
turn
at
the
automatic
gate
which
permitted
none
but
presentees
of
a
certain
coin
of
the
realm
to
obtain
access
to
the
auditorium
myself
and
escort
passed
up
a
grand
staircase
and
presently
reached
the
platform
where
my
own
appearance
proved
the
signal
for
a
loud
and
burst
of
applause
which
was
presently
renewed
when
was
ushered
on
to
the
platform
wasn
t
nervous
i
could
see
that
at
a
glance
i
never
saw
anyone
look
around
on
a
vast
multitude
of
people
with
such
a
superlatively
ridiculous
affectation
of
arrogance
and
accentuated
and
a
curious
conviction
suddenly
assailed
me
the
honourable
augustus
was
not
of
the
sort
of
material
that
can
ever
be
brought
to
eat
humble
pie
under
any
circumstances
whatever
his
experiences
in
this
marvellous
country
only
served
to
emphasize
his
national
prejudices
and
i
could
see
that
so
far
from
acknowledging
native
superiority
he
was
bent
upon
making
the
erstwhile
proud
boast
that
he
was
a
true
born
a
quick
compassionate
glance
which
he
threw
at
me
also
revealed
the
fact
that
he
rather
pitied
me
for
the
feminine
ignorance
and
incompetence
which
i
was
doomed
to
display
ere
long
but
somehow
the
irritation
which
his
presence
invariably
aroused
in
me
dispelled
the
feeling
of
tremour
with
which
i
had
hitherto
been
possessed
and
i
defiantly
resolved
that
whatever
himself
might
think
upon
the
subject
our
audience
should
not
vote
my
oratorical
powers
so
vastly
inferior
to
his
my
sojourn
in
new
amazonia
had
already
tended
to
bestow
more
vigour
upon
me
and
since
my
visit
to
the
renewing
rooms
i
had
felt
unwontedly
strong
now
that
pique
wounded
vanity
or
a
natural
spirit
of
it
what
you
banished
my
nervousness
i
felt
equal
to
any
demands
which
were
likely
to
be
made
upon
my
powers
of
endurance
the
honourable
augustus
was
also
somewhat
improved
in
physique
but
i
did
not
fear
the
contest
as
i
instinctively
felt
that
the
very
weapons
with
which
he
was
so
fond
of
asserting
his
superiority
to
my
own
unfortunate
sex
would
be
the
means
of
his
undoing
in
popular
esteem
if
brought
into
action
on
this
occasion
the
proceedings
began
by
our
introduction
to
several
prominent
new
amazonian
celebrities
one
of
whom
was
no
less
an
individual
than
the
leader
herself
whose
dark
green
velvet
attire
was
so
richly
embroidered
with
gold
tissue
that
she
looked
perfectly
resplendent
her
cap
and
sash
were
in
addition
adorned
with
gems
of
which
the
prevailing
design
was
a
harp
encircled
with
shamrocks
the
harps
being
outlined
in
diamonds
and
the
shamrocks
in
emeralds
the
leader
herself
was
a
magnificent
woman
who
when
her
term
of
office
expired
would
once
more
lapse
into
her
former
condition
of
comparative
obscurity
as
professor
of
moral
philosophy
for
it
was
one
of
the
laws
of
this
strange
land
that
whenever
a
leader
s
term
of
office
had
run
out
she
should
for
ten
years
at
least
take
no
further
active
part
in
the
government
of
her
country
the
next
leader
elected
was
always
one
of
the
prime
advisers
who
had
already
done
duty
in
the
ranks
of
the
privy
councillors
these
in
their
turn
being
elected
by
popular
vote
from
the
tribunes
it
was
considered
desirable
to
afford
equal
chances
to
every
candidate
for
office
hence
the
limitations
of
time
insisted
upon
when
the
leader
entered
the
whole
audience
rose
to
greet
her
then
as
soon
as
she
and
her
escort
were
seated
and
our
introduction
to
her
was
graciously
acknowledged
principal
grey
in
a
few
words
described
how
one
of
her
students
had
encountered
the
two
strangers
in
the
college
garden
and
the
arrangements
that
had
been
made
for
our
comfort
and
entertainment
while
she
was
still
speaking
the
honourable
augustus
skipped
over
the
stage
on
tiptoe
and
enquired
i
say
are
you
going
to
speak
first
or
am
i
just
as
you
like
i
replied
in
a
whisper
willing
to
do
anything
to
get
rid
of
him
and
cover
his
breach
of
manners
in
creating
a
diversion
while
principal
grey
was
still
speaking
that
s
all
right
then
he
ejaculated
evidently
greatly
relieved
you
see
i
am
used
to
speaking
in
public
and
you
are
not
you
might
spoil
the
impression
i
wish
to
create
if
you
spoke
first
and
for
goodness
sake
bestow
your
attention
upon
your
surroundings
i
interrupted
hurriedly
standing
up
as
i
spoke
and
accepting
the
hand
of
principal
grey
who
led
me
forward
and
introduced
me
to
the
audience
a
very
handsome
man
performing
the
like
service
for
the
honourable
augustus
who
bowed
so
theatrically
and
looked
so
killingly
dudish
that
the
one
prevailing
expression
on
the
faces
of
all
who
saw
him
was
a
large
smile
which
produced
radiant
satisfaction
in
augustus
mr
wishes
to
speak
first
i
quietly
informed
the
principal
she
looked
not
a
little
surprised
at
what
she
evidently
regarded
as
his
presumption
but
no
objection
was
made
to
the
proposal
and
in
another
moment
we
were
listening
to
the
honourable
augustus
s
remarkable
peroration
ladies
and
gentlemen
he
began
and
was
forthwith
astounded
to
hear
deprecating
murmurs
all
over
the
house
for
an
instant
he
looked
dumbfounded
then
he
seemed
to
think
he
knew
what
was
wrong
and
recovered
his
presence
of
mind
with
magical
swiftness
i
beg
the
pardon
of
all
those
here
assembled
he
continued
i
ought
to
have
said
and
we
are
more
polite
in
our
country
and
always
when
in
public
do
our
best
to
flatter
the
however
since
you
prefer
it
the
other
way
here
goes
it
is
with
great
pleasure
gentlemen
and
but
it
was
quite
impossible
to
catch
what
he
said
next
for
he
had
tickled
the
national
sense
of
humour
and
though
the
individual
laughter
of
each
one
present
was
the
gentlest
possible
expression
of
new
amazonian
merriment
the
collective
result
quite
deadened
the
sound
of
the
distinguished
stranger
s
voice
at
this
juncture
the
speaker
rose
to
her
feet
and
stepped
to
the
side
of
the
honourable
augustus
in
an
instant
the
deepest
silence
reigned
as
all
listened
for
the
words
of
wisdom
which
were
expected
to
fall
from
her
lips
my
children
she
began
gravely
her
rich
voice
filling
the
hall
with
melodious
sound
must
i
remind
you
that
the
laws
of
hospitality
are
violated
when
the
slightest
interruption
of
the
evening
s
programme
is
made
do
you
forget
that
it
was
ere
we
met
this
evening
that
our
guests
have
been
brought
up
under
conditions
so
dissimilar
to
our
own
that
it
is
impossible
for
them
to
be
acquainted
with
our
usual
forms
of
address
i
must
crave
your
strict
silence
during
the
remainder
of
the
proceedings
and
you
she
continued
will
perhaps
pardon
me
if
i
here
offer
the
information
that
neither
ladies
nor
gentlemen
are
supposed
to
exist
in
new
amazonia
we
pride
ourselves
upon
being
honest
women
and
men
and
discard
the
other
appellations
as
too
suggestive
of
affectations
and
mannerisms
you
will
therefore
kindly
excuse
the
feeling
of
surprise
with
which
most
of
us
heard
ourselves
greeted
by
words
which
with
us
are
terms
of
while
she
spoke
the
honourable
augustus
stood
looking
at
her
with
an
expression
of
jaunty
ease
which
spoke
volumes
for
the
invulnerability
of
his
and
even
induced
me
to
look
at
him
with
feelings
in
which
admiration
fought
for
a
place
on
a
plane
with
my
amusement
oh
don
t
mention
it
madam
he
said
airily
i
might
have
known
that
you
did
not
aspire
to
the
same
level
of
culture
as
the
english
all
the
same
i
am
very
glad
if
i
can
afford
you
amusement
so
here
goes
once
raising
his
voice
he
now
turned
to
the
audience
and
so
perfect
were
the
acoustic
properties
of
the
hall
that
every
word
he
uttered
was
heard
in
the
most
distant
corner
i
suppose
he
said
coolly
that
i
may
safely
take
your
leader
as
my
model
and
address
you
as
my
mighty
big
children
some
of
you
are
too
i
can
t
help
thinking
that
i
wouldn
t
like
too
many
of
your
size
to
provide
for
but
although
it
is
a
common
adage
in
good
old
england
that
good
stuff
is
put
into
little
compass
i
am
willing
to
admit
that
there
may
be
exceptions
and
i
honestly
think
that
the
irish
race
has
improved
since
i
first
knew
it
but
you
are
not
here
to
listen
to
my
opinions
of
you
but
to
hear
my
explanation
of
the
reasons
and
the
method
which
brought
me
hither
our
suppose
you
have
parsons
here
i
said
our
parsons
always
divide
their
sermons
under
several
heads
i
will
be
more
considerate
and
use
only
two
in
the
first
place
i
am
not
conscious
of
ever
having
had
any
reasons
for
coming
here
in
the
second
place
i
know
no
more
of
the
method
in
which
i
journeyed
hither
than
the
man
in
the
moon
you
seem
to
have
abolished
a
good
many
things
here
but
i
don
t
suppose
you
have
abolished
the
man
in
the
moon
so
you
will
know
what
i
mean
still
i
believe
i
can
offer
some
sort
of
explanation
that
will
be
of
interest
to
my
audience
when
at
home
in
my
native
country
i
am
thought
pretty
well
of
by
those
who
know
me
in
fact
i
may
say
that
i
am
rather
a
favourite
both
with
my
own
and
the
fair
sex
this
is
all
very
well
in
some
respects
but
is
not
exactly
an
unmixed
advantage
it
may
not
be
generally
known
here
that
i
am
entitled
to
wear
the
royal
arms
with
a
bar
sinister
one
of
my
ancestors
being
no
less
a
personage
than
a
king
of
england
whom
it
behoved
to
provide
for
his
offspring
since
his
benighted
people
showed
a
disinclination
to
do
so
unfortunately
the
splendid
title
and
pension
bestowed
upon
the
progenitress
of
our
family
honours
and
emoluments
have
been
appropriated
by
my
elder
brother
the
duke
of
quaverly
and
my
own
allowance
is
so
small
as
to
be
totally
inadequate
to
the
needs
of
a
scion
of
a
noble
house
this
has
caused
the
limits
of
my
enjoyments
to
be
somewhat
circumscribed
but
there
is
one
means
of
increasing
my
pleasures
which
never
fails
me
the
practice
to
which
i
allude
may
not
be
known
to
you
foreigners
but
you
have
reason
to
thank
it
for
to
it
you
owe
the
opportunity
of
listening
to
a
speech
by
the
honourable
augustus
i
can
not
say
how
long
it
is
since
for
i
have
got
rather
mixed
up
in
my
dates
but
one
evening
i
accompanied
a
friend
of
mine
to
a
certain
establishment
in
soho
where
we
partook
of
some
hasheesh
and
comfortably
reclining
upon
some
velvet
lounges
resigned
ourselves
to
the
enjoyment
of
the
dreams
which
we
expected
my
dreamy
state
came
on
soon
enough
but
the
first
thing
i
remember
is
finding
myself
stuck
up
an
apple
tree
i
must
leave
it
to
the
perspicacity
of
the
assembled
multitude
to
explain
how
i
came
there
as
you
already
know
i
was
not
the
only
fresh
importation
from
my
country
but
the
other
party
will
speak
for
herself
then
one
of
i
say
women
ah
of
your
women
and
a
dooced
fine
woman
too
came
upon
the
scene
cut
the
other
party
altogether
took
a
violent
fancy
to
myself
and
informed
others
of
my
arrival
i
have
been
since
i
came
here
that
is
as
well
as
you
know
how
to
do
it
but
i
think
it
s
a
confounded
nuisance
not
to
be
able
to
get
hold
of
a
bit
of
butcher
s
meat
and
it
s
just
beastly
to
be
unable
to
raise
a
smoke
in
any
shape
or
form
there
are
many
other
things
in
which
we
londoners
at
least
can
beat
you
into
fits
there
is
a
much
greater
proportion
of
married
women
among
us
i
have
been
told
that
the
women
here
prefer
to
be
old
maids
but
i
know
a
trick
worth
two
of
that
i
have
often
heard
the
same
sort
of
thing
in
england
and
the
very
people
that
professed
such
sentiments
always
snapped
at
the
first
chance
of
a
husband
they
got
i
may
say
that
i
prefer
teetotalism
just
now
but
oh
jemima
don
t
i
wish
that
some
of
you
would
tempt
me
with
a
bottle
of
moët
and
chandon
in
fact
the
very
thought
of
all
i
am
deprived
of
while
here
has
thoroughly
upset
me
and
i
don
t
care
how
soon
i
m
home
saying
this
poor
augustus
ceased
speaking
and
sat
down
on
the
seat
provided
for
him
with
such
a
sour
and
discontented
expression
on
his
face
that
one
could
almost
fancy
a
transformation
had
taken
place
and
that
was
someone
other
than
the
man
who
commenced
his
speech
so
jauntily
as
for
the
audience
it
seemed
to
me
that
every
face
i
looked
at
wore
an
expression
of
disgust
at
the
man
who
was
rewarding
the
mother
s
hospitality
so
rudely
the
deep
silence
which
followed
upon
the
speech
from
which
much
edification
had
been
expected
appeared
to
me
to
be
so
ominous
of
displeasure
that
all
my
erstwhile
nervousness
in
full
force
but
i
was
anxious
to
undo
the
unpleasant
impression
which
my
countryman
had
made
and
the
initiatory
sentence
of
my
speech
once
got
over
i
talked
fluently
enough
i
really
do
not
remember
half
of
what
i
said
but
think
that
i
must
have
expressed
myself
graphically
and
satisfactorily
enough
for
i
sat
down
amid
a
perfect
thunder
of
applause
which
caused
the
honourable
augustus
to
look
daggers
at
me
i
daresay
he
was
justified
in
doing
so
for
i
fancy
that
when
i
was
drawing
comparisons
between
my
own
country
and
the
one
in
which
we
were
sojourning
and
all
to
the
credit
of
the
latter
he
believed
me
to
be
actuated
more
by
a
desire
to
flatter
my
audience
than
to
speak
the
honest
truth
that
he
was
mistaken
in
this
respect
i
can
truthfully
say
but
i
do
not
suppose
he
has
forgiven
me
to
this
day
unless
he
has
come
to
look
upon
the
whole
affair
as
the
production
of
his
imagination
but
whatever
my
countryman
may
have
thought
of
my
performance
it
evidently
satisfied
everybody
else
and
i
was
very
glad
that
this
was
so
as
i
felt
that
some
return
was
due
from
me
for
all
the
kindness
and
hospitality
i
had
met
with
during
my
sojourn
here
chapter
xiv
i
was
now
invited
as
the
guest
of
many
distinguished
personages
and
thoroughly
enjoyed
my
life
for
the
next
few
days
i
found
new
amazonian
men
quite
as
charming
as
the
women
both
as
regards
physique
and
culture
beards
were
in
great
favour
here
and
shaving
was
decidedly
at
a
discount
but
a
great
length
of
hair
was
not
coveted
by
anyone
and
the
beards
were
always
neatly
clipped
at
the
different
entertainments
i
noticed
a
great
deal
of
promiscuity
such
as
would
hardly
be
tolerated
in
aristocratic
english
society
not
that
there
was
ever
anyone
present
who
was
not
perfectly
but
intellect
was
the
principal
passport
to
social
privileges
here
and
we
all
know
that
intellectuality
may
languish
in
obscure
corners
in
england
unless
backed
by
strong
personal
or
monetary
interest
and
that
our
class
prejudices
are
unpleasantly
strong
a
young
mechanician
whom
i
met
at
the
house
of
one
of
the
prime
advisers
was
a
universal
favourite
and
his
modesty
and
good
sense
were
admirable
foils
to
the
plethora
of
which
i
have
seen
engendered
in
english
lions
for
far
less
potent
reasons
i
was
told
that
his
inventions
and
improvements
in
matters
relating
to
sanitary
science
were
so
marvellous
and
of
so
beneficent
a
nature
that
he
was
to
be
rewarded
with
the
medal
of
the
order
of
merit
an
honour
which
it
will
be
observed
was
well
worth
having
he
being
only
the
thirtieth
recipient
within
two
hundred
years
it
was
not
difficult
for
me
to
secure
an
interview
with
him
as
mutual
curiosity
drew
us
together
if
i
had
expected
his
conversation
to
savour
of
shop
i
was
strongly
mistaken
for
not
a
word
of
his
own
great
achievements
did
he
breathe
and
he
drew
me
out
so
skilfully
that
passed
in
conversation
with
him
before
his
professional
instincts
were
at
all
aroused
and
then
it
was
in
response
to
some
reply
i
had
made
respecting
the
locality
in
which
i
resided
when
last
i
remembered
being
in
my
own
country
within
fifteen
minutes
walk
of
the
house
in
which
george
stephenson
resided
he
exclaimed
in
great
wonderment
i
always
understood
that
it
was
quite
a
humble
affair
surely
it
must
have
crumbled
to
dust
centuries
ago
by
no
i
returned
the
cottage
looked
very
pretty
and
picturesque
the
last
time
i
saw
it
it
is
tenanted
by
people
who
take
a
pride
in
the
garden
and
it
would
compare
favourably
in
external
appearance
with
any
other
cottage
of
the
same
size
in
england
it
is
known
locally
as
the
dial
house
as
it
boasts
a
sundial
of
which
some
portion
was
the
work
of
stephenson
himself
at
the
end
of
the
house
is
a
very
greenhouse
and
the
space
of
ground
in
which
the
great
engineer
had
some
lines
laid
for
experimental
purposes
is
converted
into
a
kitchen
it
seems
so
incredible
that
i
can
hardly
take
it
all
in
said
john
saville
with
a
smile
which
robbed
his
words
of
all
possibility
of
giving
offence
nevertheless
i
would
give
much
to
be
able
to
see
the
same
place
and
witness
the
actual
scenes
in
which
a
great
genius
conceived
the
wonderful
inventions
which
revolutionised
the
commerce
and
social
relations
of
the
but
you
would
not
appear
to
venerate
stephenson
s
inventions
very
much
since
you
have
discarded
them
altogether
in
favour
of
other
systems
of
true
but
our
are
in
reality
gradual
evolvements
arising
from
the
basis
afforded
by
a
knowledge
of
locomotive
travelling
as
it
still
existed
a
few
centuries
ago
and
we
can
never
forget
that
for
some
hundreds
of
years
railways
were
the
chief
factors
of
there
is
another
thing
which
new
amazonians
have
discarded
for
no
sufficient
reason
it
seems
to
and
that
is
there
you
labour
under
a
mistake
new
amazonians
did
not
discard
christianity
it
was
christianity
which
declined
to
help
them
when
new
amazonia
was
first
peopled
by
the
colonists
from
the
adult
colonists
were
as
you
doubtless
know
all
women
it
was
the
intention
of
these
women
to
govern
their
state
with
as
much
success
as
was
compatible
with
the
rejection
of
conventionality
and
traditionary
laws
it
had
hitherto
been
their
lot
to
be
excluded
from
a
great
proportion
of
national
privileges
which
had
been
usurped
by
the
masculine
sex
for
ages
in
casting
about
for
the
principal
causes
of
their
limitations
of
fairplay
they
found
them
or
thought
they
did
so
in
the
doctrines
of
christianity
one
of
the
principal
christian
writers
indeed
seemed
to
be
quite
as
much
bent
upon
insulting
humiliating
and
subjugating
woman
as
he
was
upon
spreading
the
christian
cause
new
amazonian
leaders
found
that
they
could
not
take
an
active
part
in
public
affairs
without
violating
all
the
rules
laid
down
for
woman
s
guidance
and
man
s
encouragement
by
the
apostle
paul
it
was
a
case
either
of
christianity
and
reversion
to
slavery
or
a
sort
of
unitarianism
and
freedom
and
they
did
not
hesitate
long
as
to
what
choice
to
make
they
were
not
likely
being
intelligent
beings
to
inaugurate
a
retrogressive
movement
by
instructing
their
boys
in
tenets
which
constantly
preached
the
inferiority
and
subservience
of
women
especially
as
they
believed
paul
s
utterances
on
matters
feminine
to
be
dictated
more
by
spite
than
by
honest
and
what
were
their
grounds
for
this
belief
their
reasons
are
easily
explained
we
have
it
on
reliable
authority
that
saul
of
tarsus
whose
parents
were
greeks
not
jews
but
who
had
himself
adopted
the
jewish
persuasion
was
a
man
of
very
violent
passions
and
prejudices
he
hated
the
christians
and
took
delight
in
helping
to
exterminate
them
it
was
when
in
jerusalem
bent
upon
some
such
mission
that
he
was
introduced
to
the
daughter
of
the
jewish
high
priest
and
fell
passionately
in
love
with
her
to
his
intense
mortification
his
proposal
for
her
hand
was
rejected
and
he
henceforth
hated
both
women
and
jews
becoming
enthusiastically
christian
by
way
of
a
but
even
if
this
be
true
the
fact
that
paul
is
not
believed
in
here
would
hardly
account
for
the
repudiation
of
the
doctrines
taught
by
the
other
apostles
of
i
think
it
would
you
see
paul
was
a
man
of
great
ability
who
had
had
the
advantage
of
studying
under
one
of
the
greatest
teachers
of
the
age
his
words
carried
weight
with
them
and
influenced
those
with
whom
he
associated
his
writings
and
influence
are
inseparable
from
christianity
even
were
this
not
so
there
is
only
too
much
proof
given
in
history
that
of
all
bigots
and
fanatics
christian
bigots
and
fanatics
are
the
most
cruel
relentless
and
implacable
christ
himself
would
have
repudiated
a
religion
which
has
made
his
name
an
excuse
for
robbery
oppression
murder
and
you
surely
exaggerate
enormously
all
christians
disseminate
the
doctrines
preached
by
christ
in
his
famous
sermon
on
the
mount
the
ten
commandments
especially
are
taught
to
all
young
yes
and
a
fine
mockery
it
has
been
to
be
sure
you
will
remember
that
one
commandment
adjures
us
to
refrain
from
making
any
graven
image
nor
the
likeness
of
anything
that
is
in
the
heaven
above
or
in
the
earth
beneath
or
in
the
water
under
the
we
are
forbidden
to
bow
down
to
such
things
or
to
worship
them
and
yet
how
small
a
proportion
of
christian
peoples
ever
obeyed
these
injunctions
until
the
time
of
one
martin
luther
god
himself
was
utterly
set
aside
in
the
christian
churches
which
were
filled
with
images
and
shrines
before
which
deluded
suppliants
poured
out
their
vain
supplications
christianity
had
been
entirely
supplanted
by
idolatry
and
existed
as
such
only
in
name
again
we
are
forbidden
to
take
the
name
of
the
great
in
vain
and
yet
what
do
we
find
recorded
priests
calling
themselves
christians
professed
to
have
the
power
to
grant
forgiveness
of
sins
in
the
name
of
the
almighty
some
of
these
sins
were
actually
and
whether
past
or
still
to
be
committed
their
confession
to
a
priest
accompanied
by
the
gift
of
a
sum
of
money
ensured
a
free
pardon
from
heaven
of
course
the
was
always
required
and
those
who
were
too
poor
to
pander
to
priestly
greed
were
remorselessly
consigned
to
purgatory
murder
of
course
was
strictly
forbidden
and
yet
the
advocates
of
christianity
murdered
and
tortured
thousands
of
people
simply
because
they
presumed
to
differ
slightly
in
opinion
from
those
in
office
stealing
was
prohibited
but
the
priests
were
willing
to
take
the
last
mite
from
the
oppressed
poor
rather
than
abate
one
jot
of
their
lazy
sensuous
privileges
as
for
the
sin
of
covetousness
in
whom
has
it
ever
shown
itself
more
rampant
than
in
the
men
whose
chief
energies
were
directed
towards
appropriating
the
wealth
of
all
with
whom
they
came
in
contact
for
the
joint
benefit
of
themselves
and
the
church
i
grant
you
all
this
but
it
refers
to
a
state
of
things
which
has
long
since
passed
has
passed
away
do
priests
work
for
the
pure
love
of
god
or
do
they
look
upon
their
vocation
as
a
means
of
making
a
livelihood
more
to
their
taste
than
some
others
is
the
priestly
office
the
guerdon
of
merit
and
ability
or
is
it
still
the
perquisite
of
those
who
have
money
and
family
influence
at
command
do
priests
exercise
universal
charity
and
kindly
feeling
have
they
given
up
thinking
that
none
but
themselves
and
a
few
individuals
will
be
allowed
to
enter
heaven
do
they
feel
as
much
reverence
for
goodness
in
the
lowly
as
they
do
for
grandeur
in
high
places
do
they
discourage
the
presence
in
their
churches
of
disreputable
persons
if
these
persons
happen
to
be
rich
and
are
able
to
be
used
as
pecuniary
aids
in
a
word
are
the
churches
possessed
of
truly
qualities
without
which
none
can
be
a
christian
john
saville
had
by
this
time
worked
himself
into
a
perfect
glow
of
enthusiasm
while
i
certainly
felt
correspondingly
humiliated
for
i
was
not
in
a
position
to
return
an
affirmative
answer
to
all
his
questions
did
i
not
remember
seeing
a
man
who
had
not
thrown
off
the
effects
of
the
previous
night
s
intoxication
officiating
in
a
prominent
position
with
the
priest
s
approval
in
one
of
our
established
churches
have
i
not
witnessed
many
another
instance
of
priestly
tolerance
of
evil
for
mammon
s
sake
have
i
not
recently
met
with
a
specimen
of
clerical
intolerance
which
would
do
credit
to
the
religious
persecutors
of
old
candidates
for
confirmation
are
requested
to
confess
their
crimes
to
themselves
and
to
turn
from
the
error
of
their
ways
before
they
can
consider
themselves
fit
to
take
their
stand
as
christians
the
sins
and
crimes
are
presented
to
the
eyes
of
the
penitents
in
the
form
of
printed
questions
and
one
of
these
questions
runs
thus
have
you
ever
entered
a
i
saw
this
myself
in
the
year
and
was
compelled
now
to
admit
the
conviction
that
to
discard
christ
and
to
discard
christianity
may
be
two
very
different
things
it
seemed
marvellous
when
i
came
to
think
of
it
how
a
thinking
people
like
the
new
amazonians
should
after
all
these
ages
have
singled
out
christ
as
the
one
pure
and
shining
light
of
earth
so
godlike
as
to
be
worthy
of
being
at
once
translated
to
companionship
with
the
giver
of
life
seeing
that
his
professed
devotees
have
since
the
earliest
times
of
the
church
done
more
to
bring
his
cause
into
disrepute
than
all
his
enemies
you
admit
yourself
worsted
smiled
saville
i
confess
as
much
i
replied
but
how
comes
it
that
you
a
man
should
so
enthusiastically
uphold
the
only
constitution
in
the
world
which
has
so
far
as
i
know
successfully
resisted
man
s
striving
for
supremacy
because
i
am
thoroughly
satisfied
and
contented
with
my
lot
and
because
no
country
upon
earth
presents
such
advantages
to
her
citizens
as
new
amazonia
does
our
women
have
proved
their
capacity
to
govern
wisely
and
well
our
constitution
has
found
imitators
proof
positive
that
others
regard
our
system
with
approval
yet
nowhere
do
we
meet
with
such
health
and
prosperity
as
in
our
country
for
man
s
political
influence
has
in
all
ages
proved
corruptive
and
retrogressive
our
health
is
perfect
and
we
know
that
it
is
to
the
beneficent
rule
of
our
women
that
we
owe
our
strength
of
mind
and
body
it
would
be
suicidal
on
our
part
to
wish
to
revert
to
a
state
of
things
which
insured
us
nothing
so
much
as
sickly
bodies
for
how
could
we
expect
to
be
strong
and
healthy
as
we
are
if
our
mothers
were
reduced
to
the
condition
of
the
women
some
of
us
see
when
we
travel
but
do
you
not
find
your
social
masculine
disabilities
somewhat
irritating
we
do
not
labour
under
any
disabilities
of
importance
that
i
know
of
we
are
not
eligible
for
political
office
but
many
men
hold
important
and
lucrative
posts
under
government
in
which
our
administrative
talents
are
given
fairplay
and
in
all
other
respects
the
educational
social
and
elective
privileges
of
the
sexes
are
perfectly
i
am
glad
to
hear
such
opinions
from
you
if
you
could
hear
the
croaking
that
goes
on
in
my
country
at
the
mere
prospect
of
women
being
allowed
to
vote
you
would
wonder
at
the
amount
of
prejudice
and
opposition
which
your
ancestresses
well
when
you
get
back
to
your
country
you
must
try
to
enlighten
your
own
suppose
i
were
never
to
find
my
way
back
how
do
you
suppose
i
should
fare
here
will
the
mother
soon
be
tired
of
entertaining
me
not
just
yet
i
think
but
if
your
stay
with
us
should
prove
likely
to
be
permanent
you
would
yourself
most
probably
desire
to
make
some
arrangement
whereby
you
could
secure
a
provision
for
old
age
you
probably
have
been
trained
to
a
profession
of
some
kind
no
i
have
not
i
was
brought
up
as
the
majority
of
young
women
in
my
country
are
brought
up
it
was
supposed
i
expect
that
i
should
settle
down
in
due
course
that
is
marry
and
that
an
independent
profession
for
myself
would
not
be
and
you
say
that
such
folly
is
the
common
practice
in
your
country
that
accounts
for
many
of
the
deplorable
things
you
have
told
me
how
can
women
be
independent
and
free
if
they
have
to
rely
upon
others
to
keep
them
where
is
the
woman
in
new
amazonia
do
you
think
who
would
care
thus
to
sacrifice
her
position
of
independence
such
a
being
does
not
exist
and
i
think
that
your
women
have
themselves
or
their
guardians
to
thank
in
great
measure
for
all
the
disadvantages
under
which
they
labour
it
will
be
rather
awkward
for
you
though
if
you
can
not
turn
your
hand
to
i
suppose
it
would
be
awkward
if
this
were
so
as
it
happens
however
i
never
gave
myself
up
to
an
idle
life
but
gradually
drifted
into
literature
and
i
could
probably
find
employment
on
one
of
your
numerous
certainly
if
you
are
a
graphic
writer
you
are
sure
of
an
appointment
such
writers
are
always
welcome
and
you
must
have
so
much
to
say
you
will
not
need
to
cast
about
long
for
employment
should
it
be
your
lot
to
remain
with
us
and
you
will
be
able
to
earn
as
much
as
will
make
ample
provision
for
old
age
when
it
comes
as
you
are
perhaps
aware
a
small
percentage
of
our
earnings
is
always
appropriated
by
the
state
and
a
proportionate
pension
becomes
our
due
as
soon
as
we
wish
to
claim
it
if
we
claim
our
pension
at
the
age
of
seventy
or
eighty
it
is
relatively
smaller
than
if
we
wait
until
our
hundredth
year
or
thereabouts
we
are
usually
not
in
a
hurry
to
place
ourselves
upon
the
pension
list
for
our
active
period
of
labour
ceases
then
and
this
source
of
income
is
lost
still
if
we
have
filled
responsible
positions
in
life
and
have
been
fortunate
enough
to
accumulate
wealth
we
can
if
we
like
hand
it
all
over
to
the
state
in
return
for
an
augmented
annuity
my
own
parents
have
done
this
and
are
very
happy
and
comfortable
with
not
a
care
in
the
world
there
is
also
another
source
of
profit
which
we
enjoy
new
amazonia
is
one
huge
establishment
for
we
are
all
interested
in
promoting
its
stability
and
prosperity
there
is
another
condition
besides
being
compelled
to
have
reached
a
certain
age
before
we
can
vote
at
elections
we
must
all
women
and
men
purchase
a
share
in
the
country
and
we
are
all
very
anxious
to
do
so
seeing
that
these
shares
are
always
at
a
premium
and
command
greater
returns
than
any
other
form
of
surely
this
is
a
source
of
danger
to
the
community
could
not
some
people
by
purchasing
a
large
number
of
shares
thus
obtain
the
means
of
usurping
undue
power
and
influence
impossible
we
are
not
permitted
to
hold
more
than
one
share
individually
the
idea
is
to
make
us
all
of
equal
station
in
the
eyes
of
the
law
and
to
ensure
our
individual
interest
in
the
maintenance
of
peace
and
order
when
a
state
bondholder
dies
the
equivalent
of
her
or
his
bond
is
divided
amongst
such
legatees
as
may
have
been
named
in
the
and
if
there
is
no
will
that
never
happens
for
it
is
compulsory
to
make
a
will
immediately
upon
becoming
a
state
shareholder
of
course
if
we
wish
the
value
of
our
bond
to
revert
to
the
state
we
name
the
state
as
our
legatee
and
we
are
at
liberty
to
alter
our
will
whenever
we
you
seem
to
have
no
money
here
other
than
the
silver
unit
is
this
your
standard
of
value
in
all
monetary
transactions
yes
the
unit
pervades
every
business
transaction
if
not
practically
at
least
theoretically
but
it
is
seldom
used
to
pay
large
amounts
with
a
paper
currency
serving
our
purposes
much
better
than
metal
coinage
would
are
private
banks
for
business
houses
allowed
to
issue
paper
money
no
none
but
state
coupons
are
permitted
to
be
now
just
one
more
question
and
then
i
have
finished
i
am
told
that
the
state
is
the
ultimate
receiver
of
all
manufactured
goods
which
may
neither
be
retailed
nor
exported
without
first
yielding
the
imposed
percentage
is
it
not
possible
for
a
group
of
speculators
to
force
prices
up
either
by
buying
a
vast
quantity
of
goods
from
the
manufacturers
and
selling
at
their
own
price
to
the
state
or
more
probable
could
they
not
buy
in
large
quantities
from
the
state
and
retail
at
their
own
prices
to
the
public
certainly
not
the
state
would
not
deal
with
them
nor
would
it
permit
any
increase
of
prices
not
necessitated
by
the
legitimate
exigencies
of
trade
speculators
of
the
class
to
which
you
allude
would
find
a
sorry
field
for
their
operations
i
could
not
complain
of
the
amount
of
information
i
had
obtained
from
john
saville
but
i
should
probably
have
been
still
further
enlightened
had
not
our
hostess
come
to
claim
our
attention
in
different
directions
but
before
saying
farewell
for
the
night
he
asked
me
to
visit
his
parents
on
the
day
following
and
promised
me
a
little
enlightenment
concerning
some
domestic
arrangements
in
which
i
was
interested
chapter
xv
on
being
introduced
to
john
saville
s
home
i
found
a
great
deal
more
of
simple
solid
comfort
than
i
had
expected
and
such
an
air
of
domesticity
as
my
own
residence
in
the
college
had
led
me
to
suppose
altogether
absent
from
new
amazonian
dwellings
at
my
own
request
my
visit
was
of
the
most
informal
kind
and
not
another
stranger
was
there
here
to
disturb
the
cosiness
of
the
quiet
chat
which
i
wished
to
enjoy
saville
was
possessed
of
the
bright
brown
hair
clear
rosy
skin
and
deep
grey
eyes
so
indicative
of
pure
irish
descent
coupled
with
a
grace
and
charm
of
manner
i
had
never
seen
equalled
by
an
englishwoman
of
similar
age
saville
also
struck
me
as
just
a
likely
sort
of
man
to
be
the
father
of
such
a
clever
popular
son
it
was
clear
that
they
both
doted
upon
him
and
just
as
clear
that
he
would
have
been
sorry
to
do
anything
likely
to
cause
them
grief
but
they
did
not
treat
me
to
a
long
category
of
each
other
s
virtues
preferring
to
let
me
form
my
own
opinion
of
them
as
individuals
while
they
did
their
best
to
initiate
me
into
the
ways
of
new
amazonian
domestic
life
their
house
consisted
of
a
suite
of
rooms
in
a
large
block
of
buildings
in
one
of
the
best
parts
of
andersonia
and
was
fitted
with
even
convenience
which
would
conduce
to
ease
and
comfort
the
furniture
was
ideally
suitable
good
and
elegant
but
the
pictures
on
the
walls
like
many
others
which
i
had
seen
lately
amused
me
not
a
little
it
seemed
to
me
at
first
that
they
were
all
out
of
perspective
and
that
neither
walking
biped
running
quadruped
nor
flying
bird
was
painted
aright
however
i
got
more
used
to
these
pictorial
oddities
and
caught
myself
thinking
that
when
i
got
home
again
i
should
be
wanting
to
introduce
some
of
these
muybridgeian
notions
into
my
own
rooms
the
fire
cast
a
comfortable
glow
on
all
around
making
it
difficult
to
believe
that
the
problem
of
fuel
for
the
future
was
now
definitely
settled
and
that
electricity
could
now
and
henceforth
be
made
to
supply
the
necessary
fuel
for
warming
lighting
cooking
and
manufacturing
purposes
no
dirt
or
dust
from
ashes
and
no
discoloration
as
the
result
of
burning
gas
was
here
felt
for
neither
the
one
nor
the
other
were
now
in
use
both
had
served
humanity
well
in
their
day
both
were
now
superseded
by
a
much
more
efficient
cleanly
and
convenient
agent
after
our
very
appetising
evening
meal
had
been
despatched
i
was
taken
on
a
tour
of
inspection
round
the
building
or
rather
round
such
parts
of
it
as
were
public
to
all
the
tenants
the
basement
consisted
entirely
of
shops
which
were
connected
by
means
of
telephones
with
every
suite
in
the
block
and
could
with
the
aid
of
electric
lifts
supply
anything
ordered
per
telephone
at
a
moment
s
notice
nor
was
there
any
fear
of
extortionate
charges
or
a
poor
sample
of
goods
since
everything
had
to
be
priced
according
to
the
day
s
government
scale
and
the
daily
visits
of
government
inspectors
ensured
the
withdrawal
of
inferior
or
unwholesome
articles
while
conversing
on
telephonic
subjects
i
mentioned
that
even
in
my
benighted
country
we
had
made
good
use
of
this
valuable
invention
there
are
even
telephones
attached
to
churches
and
theatres
i
said
by
means
of
which
a
sermon
or
a
song
may
be
heard
at
great
distances
from
the
places
in
which
they
are
delivered
but
of
course
you
have
even
improved
upon
these
notions
i
think
we
have
smiled
saville
some
hundreds
of
years
ago
there
was
hardly
a
building
in
new
amazonia
which
was
not
a
perfect
network
of
telephones
and
patent
lifts
and
our
people
began
to
give
the
mother
considerable
anxiety
for
they
showed
rapid
signs
of
deterioration
on
looking
round
for
the
causes
of
this
unfortunate
falling
back
it
was
found
to
be
produced
by
the
mania
for
saving
labour
and
exercise
of
every
possible
sort
and
drastic
measures
were
speedily
introduced
many
of
the
lifts
were
abolished
and
substantial
staircases
erected
in
their
stead
up
and
down
which
the
people
were
expected
to
walk
when
going
in
or
out
the
goods
lifts
were
however
not
considered
too
provocative
of
laziness
and
inactivity
and
still
remain
very
useful
adjuncts
to
civilization
the
telephone
system
though
disapproved
of
by
the
mother
did
not
require
quite
such
stringent
measures
to
make
it
almost
a
thing
of
the
past
so
far
as
mere
amusement
is
concerned
when
it
first
became
possible
to
hear
a
concert
or
lecture
without
being
compelled
to
leave
one
s
own
house
everybody
went
in
for
this
sort
of
spiritless
amusement
but
it
soon
palled
upon
the
people
for
there
is
no
comparison
between
such
a
apology
for
social
enjoyment
and
the
pleasure
to
be
derived
from
sitting
within
sight
of
the
speakers
or
musicians
and
taking
in
their
general
appearance
gestures
and
accessories
curiosity
will
always
be
one
of
the
strongest
elements
in
human
composition
and
no
social
pleasure
is
perfect
which
does
not
permit
the
eyes
to
aid
the
ears
in
their
appreciation
of
the
fare
offered
to
them
when
therefore
the
novelty
of
telephonic
entertainments
was
over
the
people
tired
of
them
and
hardly
cared
to
listen
to
the
amusing
or
instructive
sounds
they
had
paid
their
money
to
ensure
and
when
a
few
years
later
the
government
imposed
a
tax
upon
the
use
of
all
telephones
not
of
a
strictly
useful
or
business
nature
the
de
was
given
to
the
system
and
we
have
never
reverted
to
it
after
that
i
thought
i
will
be
careful
about
boasting
of
english
progress
since
what
we
deem
the
summit
of
luxurious
ease
is
here
looked
upon
as
the
babyhood
of
true
civilization
and
did
the
reforms
you
mention
produce
the
results
which
government
aimed
at
i
enquired
aloud
yes
was
the
reply
bodily
health
and
strength
depend
in
great
measure
upon
a
rational
exercise
of
our
physical
capabilities
the
more
exercise
of
a
reasonable
nature
we
take
the
stronger
and
the
more
capable
of
work
and
enjoyment
are
we
the
more
we
give
way
to
indolence
and
yield
to
the
temptation
to
stay
indoors
the
more
demoralized
and
unfit
for
the
daily
duties
of
life
do
we
become
to
encourage
anything
that
produces
physical
deterioration
is
to
retard
our
chances
of
attaining
spiritual
perfection
and
is
too
dear
a
price
to
pay
for
such
unsatisfactory
while
talking
we
were
making
due
progress
in
our
investigations
and
by
this
time
had
come
to
a
part
of
the
building
which
filled
me
with
admiring
wonder
a
large
brass
plate
affixed
to
a
massive
door
informed
me
that
these
were
the
premises
of
the
domestic
aid
society
on
touching
an
electric
bell
the
door
opened
and
showed
us
a
spacious
vestibule
at
one
side
of
which
was
situated
the
office
of
the
whose
vocation
it
was
to
keep
a
strict
account
of
all
comings
and
goings
and
register
the
orders
and
commissions
which
were
constantly
coming
in
per
telephone
from
different
parts
of
this
and
other
buildings
in
the
city
this
it
seemed
was
visitors
day
and
we
proceeded
to
inspect
the
domestic
aid
society
s
premises
at
our
leisure
the
first
room
we
entered
was
a
working
hall
in
which
members
of
both
sexes
were
busily
engaged
in
fashioning
various
articles
for
personal
and
household
use
it
was
a
species
of
dressmaking
millinery
tailoring
and
plain
sewing
establishment
all
rolled
into
one
the
room
was
comfortably
and
artistically
furnished
the
presses
for
storing
materials
and
work
were
elaborately
carved
and
pleasant
to
look
upon
the
light
warmth
and
ventilation
were
all
perfect
and
i
could
not
help
thinking
how
delighted
a
london
worker
would
be
if
privileged
to
labour
in
such
pleasant
quarters
no
wonder
everybody
looked
happy
and
healthy
here
since
even
the
most
humble
in
the
land
were
ensured
perfect
sanitary
surroundings
and
limited
hours
of
work
another
room
that
pleased
me
exceedingly
was
the
cookery
here
for
the
benefit
of
those
who
preferred
to
order
their
supplies
ready
for
the
table
every
branch
of
the
culinary
art
was
in
progress
from
the
making
of
plain
bread
to
the
concoction
of
the
most
delicate
dainties
the
walls
of
the
cookery
were
covered
with
white
tiles
the
floor
was
white
the
tables
were
immaculate
and
the
cooks
and
confectioners
were
spotlessly
neat
and
clean
there
was
neither
fuss
heat
nor
discomfort
as
is
the
case
in
england
when
a
great
deal
of
cooking
has
to
be
done
for
the
work
was
done
systematically
and
the
greatest
pains
had
been
taken
to
make
all
the
conditions
of
labour
as
pleasant
as
possible
our
next
visit
was
made
to
the
laundry
and
it
was
a
treat
to
see
how
science
had
been
brought
to
bear
upon
the
solution
of
the
greatest
problem
which
my
own
countrywomen
are
beset
with
how
to
minimise
the
labour
and
discomfort
which
with
us
so
invariably
attend
washing
days
from
beginning
to
end
nearly
every
laundry
operation
was
conducted
by
means
of
noiseless
electric
machinery
manipulated
by
skilled
workpeople
who
knew
their
work
to
be
quite
as
valuable
and
much
more
necessary
than
the
productions
of
those
who
followed
the
purely
ornamental
arts
in
response
to
my
questions
on
the
subject
saville
gave
me
the
following
information
the
domestic
aid
society
is
one
of
the
most
popular
of
all
new
amazonian
institutions
and
there
are
establishments
of
this
sort
all
over
the
country
they
are
generally
the
property
of
private
individuals
but
are
strictly
subjected
to
state
supervision
and
regulation
the
books
are
kept
with
the
utmost
exactness
and
there
is
never
any
difficulty
in
apportioning
the
share
of
profit
which
is
due
to
the
mother
the
workpeople
no
matter
in
what
department
they
may
be
are
all
with
the
exception
of
the
supervisors
and
learners
paid
on
the
same
scale
this
enables
our
people
to
make
their
choice
of
a
vocation
in
favour
of
the
employment
they
fancy
most
without
financial
or
social
reasons
requiring
to
be
taken
into
consideration
since
both
pay
and
position
are
equal
the
hours
are
from
seven
in
the
morning
until
five
at
night
with
intervals
for
meals
all
work
out
of
these
hours
is
paid
for
on
a
special
scale
besides
the
specialists
whom
you
have
seen
there
are
many
people
employed
by
the
domestic
aid
societies
we
charter
for
servants
by
the
day
week
or
month
who
come
at
the
time
agreed
upon
and
discharge
any
household
duties
which
we
may
wish
to
entrust
to
them
messengers
are
also
supplied
for
a
trifling
commission
our
domestic
work
is
always
well
done
for
the
assistants
are
trained
by
the
state
and
are
interested
in
securing
our
goodwill
as
a
bonus
is
attached
to
the
successful
completion
of
a
lengthened
term
of
service
in
one
household
it
is
not
often
that
we
wish
our
assistants
to
be
changed
for
the
very
fact
of
knowing
that
we
have
only
to
telephone
to
the
office
to
effect
any
change
we
desire
does
away
with
the
irascibility
so
often
engendered
by
the
ancient
system
of
engaging
servants
for
long
periods
and
being
compelled
to
find
sleeping
accommodation
for
them
we
are
not
however
in
any
case
addicted
to
finding
unnecessary
faults
in
our
assistants
for
all
our
complaints
are
registered
and
if
it
is
found
that
we
are
exceptionally
bad
to
please
we
have
to
pay
a
slightly
augmented
tariff
by
way
of
atoning
for
our
unpleasant
and
how
do
these
domestic
helps
employ
their
time
when
not
on
active
duty
and
what
is
their
relative
position
as
compared
with
skilled
workpeople
is
their
work
regarded
as
inferior
by
no
means
domestic
assistants
occupy
a
very
honourable
position
in
our
social
economy
for
they
like
others
have
to
go
through
a
careful
course
of
training
and
fulfil
very
important
duties
their
scale
of
pay
is
good
and
it
is
by
no
means
difficult
for
them
to
purchase
a
if
they
are
thrifty
their
spare
time
is
employed
in
consonance
with
their
own
inclinations
there
is
a
fine
recreation
hall
attached
to
every
domestic
agency
in
the
country
in
these
our
working
classes
can
enjoy
themselves
to
their
heart
s
content
by
means
of
social
converse
music
reading
dancing
or
games
of
this
question
of
working
classes
educated
classes
is
a
very
potent
one
with
us
class
prejudice
is
strong
and
our
aristocracy
would
not
submit
to
associate
with
artisans
or
domestic
assistants
on
such
equal
terms
as
is
habitual
with
you
unless
indeed
one
of
them
were
to
succeed
to
a
fortune
and
then
all
her
or
his
vulgarities
and
shortcoming
would
find
plenty
of
consideration
how
do
you
account
for
the
superior
element
of
sociality
in
your
country
easily
we
are
all
educated
on
the
same
footing
some
of
us
develop
literary
artistic
or
scientific
instincts
early
in
life
and
speedily
find
our
vocation
others
whose
full
brain
powers
are
not
yet
developed
or
who
are
diffident
of
their
own
ability
to
adopt
one
of
the
higher
professions
choose
a
mechanical
training
and
discover
afterwards
that
they
have
missed
their
nothing
daunted
they
employ
their
leisure
in
retrieving
lost
ground
and
while
possibly
serving
in
the
capacity
of
domestic
help
may
be
qualifying
for
classical
or
surgical
examinations
and
may
even
at
some
distant
date
be
privileged
to
become
leaders
we
respect
mental
and
moral
greatness
even
if
in
embryo
and
never
object
to
society
that
is
pleasant
in
what
a
paradisaical
state
of
things
i
sighed
fervently
you
can
do
nothing
in
my
country
without
plenty
of
money
and
for
the
matter
of
that
how
do
your
erstwhile
inferiorities
succeed
in
reaching
positions
of
eminence
seeing
that
they
must
have
heavy
examination
fees
to
pay
for
which
the
adequate
amount
can
hardly
be
saved
out
of
working
class
wages
or
does
the
state
provide
examiners
free
of
charge
no
our
examiners
as
you
may
easily
suppose
are
very
responsible
and
therefore
very
officials
but
they
are
not
a
source
of
expense
to
the
government
because
the
scale
of
examination
fees
is
such
as
to
leave
a
substantial
margin
of
state
profit
want
of
funds
is
never
an
obstacle
to
progress
here
for
candidates
for
examination
are
permitted
to
pay
the
fees
from
their
future
and
suppose
they
were
inclined
to
forget
the
repayment
part
of
the
business
what
then
at
this
question
my
hearers
looked
so
astounded
that
i
felt
painfully
conscious
of
having
committed
a
huge
blunder
the
nature
of
which
was
soon
made
evident
to
me
by
the
reply
i
received
you
must
really
come
from
a
very
strange
country
said
john
saville
fortunately
for
my
composure
in
the
pleasantest
of
tones
for
such
a
question
to
be
possible
to
you
the
individual
who
could
thus
think
of
cheating
would
not
be
a
new
amazonian
but
even
if
this
were
so
the
mother
has
the
remedy
in
her
own
hands
she
would
withhold
the
pension
to
which
we
are
all
honourably
entitled
in
old
as
you
imply
i
responded
deprecatively
my
people
are
not
like
your
people
so
you
must
excuse
the
ignorance
which
prompted
what
is
evidently
an
offensive
question
i
wish
i
could
say
as
much
for
english
national
morality
as
you
can
for
yours
but
it
is
a
painful
fact
that
fully
of
the
english
race
subsists
upon
the
results
of
the
crimes
or
follies
of
the
other
half
i
prefer
however
to
talk
of
local
topics
and
learn
all
i
can
of
your
social
system
while
i
have
the
opportunity
you
will
therefore
i
hope
not
consider
me
very
troublesome
if
i
ask
yet
another
question
or
we
shall
be
only
too
happy
to
afford
you
any
assistance
in
our
power
replied
saville
then
i
said
can
you
tell
me
how
a
large
business
say
a
domestic
aid
agency
would
fare
if
the
business
done
were
inadequate
or
the
capital
subscribed
too
small
would
the
proprietors
become
bankrupt
or
would
the
mother
help
them
out
of
their
difficulties
bankruptcy
is
i
believe
an
obsolete
term
implying
that
the
subject
of
it
has
contracted
debts
which
she
or
he
does
not
intend
to
pay
such
things
do
not
occur
here
if
we
order
a
thing
and
reap
the
benefit
of
it
nothing
but
death
itself
exonerates
us
from
ultimate
payment
if
a
business
is
not
prospering
application
is
usually
made
to
the
proper
authorities
to
institute
an
investigation
and
assist
us
out
of
our
difficulties
should
it
prove
that
our
incapacity
is
at
the
root
of
the
evil
we
are
advised
to
adopt
some
less
onerous
mode
of
earning
a
livelihood
and
our
proportion
of
the
liabilities
is
discharged
by
the
state
and
accredited
to
us
for
future
repayment
if
however
mere
lack
of
capital
is
cramping
our
operations
the
state
supplies
the
necessary
impetus
and
constitutes
itself
an
active
partner
by
purchasing
as
many
shares
as
will
float
the
business
financially
and
by
appointing
a
government
agent
to
assist
in
the
management
in
fact
there
is
not
a
business
of
any
magnitude
in
the
land
in
which
the
mother
is
not
a
partner
and
in
addition
she
of
course
takes
the
percentage
of
the
profits
which
in
other
countries
is
raised
unjustly
and
unequally
by
means
of
clumsily
imposed
as
with
us
in
is
this
so
i
must
know
a
little
more
of
this
country
of
yours
which
you
call
england
england
as
known
to
us
ceased
to
exist
centuries
ago
and
yet
you
have
spoken
of
living
in
the
vicinity
of
the
home
of
george
stephenson
how
this
can
be
i
can
not
understand
we
know
that
when
he
lived
the
neighbouring
island
now
called
was
called
england
but
we
also
know
that
hundreds
of
years
are
supposed
to
have
passed
since
the
last
vestige
of
stephenson
s
northumbrian
home
was
destroyed
how
do
you
explain
such
anomalies
so
spoke
saville
and
the
rest
of
our
conversation
consisted
of
explanations
and
descriptions
on
my
own
part
which
proved
intensely
interesting
to
the
saville
family
but
which
would
sound
so
much
like
an
tale
to
my
readers
that
i
refrain
from
inflicting
it
upon
them
chapter
xvi
after
all
this
conversation
we
were
in
the
mood
to
enjoy
the
dainty
meal
spread
before
us
the
young
woman
in
attendance
was
one
of
the
employés
of
the
domestic
agency
and
had
served
saville
to
their
mutual
satisfaction
for
five
years
she
moved
about
the
room
with
a
grace
born
of
her
perfect
physical
training
which
i
would
fain
see
prevalent
in
my
own
country
in
response
to
a
question
of
john
saville
s
she
informed
us
that
there
was
to
be
a
grand
amateur
theatrical
entertainment
in
the
recreation
hall
that
evening
at
which
she
intended
to
be
one
of
the
performers
as
she
was
one
of
the
indoor
servants
of
the
agency
and
slept
in
the
building
she
was
practically
at
home
during
most
of
her
hours
of
recreation
and
she
spoke
with
all
the
verve
and
vigour
of
one
who
enjoyed
life
to
the
utmost
she
was
merry
without
familiarity
energetic
without
being
fussy
and
respectful
without
being
the
very
of
a
and
intelligent
waiting
maid
as
i
noted
herself
and
her
ways
critically
i
thought
that
there
was
really
no
reason
why
we
should
not
establish
these
domestic
aid
agencies
in
england
we
are
not
usually
very
slow
in
adopting
socially
economic
ideas
which
have
once
suggested
themselves
to
us
and
if
enterprise
and
capital
united
were
to
take
the
notion
up
the
chief
sources
of
english
domestic
worry
would
be
soon
put
an
end
to
as
would
also
the
reluctance
of
respectable
girls
to
adopt
what
is
at
present
in
only
too
many
cases
nothing
better
than
a
life
of
dull
miserable
slavery
the
meal
ended
and
the
things
all
cleared
away
alice
o
reilly
s
work
for
the
day
was
over
and
she
betook
herself
to
her
own
quarters
in
order
to
prepare
for
the
evening
s
innocent
jollities
while
we
again
reverted
to
our
comparisons
of
the
social
conditions
of
our
respective
countries
i
believe
that
the
hardest
nut
which
i
gave
the
saville
family
to
crack
was
my
statement
that
when
i
last
remembered
being
at
home
the
english
government
had
consigned
some
zealous
partisans
of
irish
liberty
to
the
temporary
seclusion
of
some
gaols
in
ireland
which
i
was
now
assured
had
long
ceased
to
exist
it
was
in
vain
that
i
insisted
and
when
i
spoke
of
queen
victoria
gladstone
and
parnell
as
living
contemporaneously
with
myself
the
amusement
of
my
friends
was
in
its
turn
amusing
to
witness
i
wouldn
t
be
surprised
after
that
said
john
saville
to
hear
that
you
claim
personal
acquaintance
with
the
immortal
writer
of
hamlet
and
do
you
allude
to
shakespeare
or
bacon
i
queried
innocently
bacon
i
know
nothing
of
bacon
retorted
john
saville
but
i
am
very
much
in
love
with
the
works
of
a
certain
william
you
think
you
are
shakespeare
did
not
write
the
plays
bearing
his
name
the
real
author
was
bacon
as
several
individuals
have
set
themselves
to
i
am
afraid
they
have
proved
their
case
but
badly
for
while
all
our
scholars
have
shakesperian
quotations
at
their
tongues
ends
there
is
not
one
of
us
who
has
ever
heard
a
whisper
of
any
presumed
baconian
origin
of
our
best
loved
poor
donnelly
from
playwright
to
novelist
was
a
natural
transition
and
remembering
sundry
financial
bruisings
in
connection
with
the
publication
of
one
of
my
earliest
and
lengthiest
novels
a
glow
of
exultation
possessed
me
when
i
learnt
the
conditions
under
which
books
were
published
nowadays
the
author
had
triumphed
at
last
and
his
erstwhile
oppressor
was
shorn
of
his
glory
i
was
told
that
the
state
had
established
an
immense
literary
bureau
with
which
large
printing
and
publishing
works
were
associated
all
works
other
than
already
licensed
newspapers
and
magazines
intended
for
publication
were
submitted
in
the
first
instance
to
the
bureau
and
read
by
the
official
censor
if
found
to
be
innocent
of
offences
against
morality
the
book
was
taken
in
hand
and
published
under
state
authority
the
author
paying
the
whole
of
the
cost
and
receiving
the
whole
of
the
future
emoluments
subject
to
the
five
per
cent
tax
accruing
to
the
state
there
was
no
arbitrary
range
of
charges
but
a
scale
of
payment
for
work
done
which
was
sufficient
to
repay
the
state
outlay
a
slight
percentage
of
profit
writers
could
by
studying
the
printed
tariff
know
exactly
what
style
and
quality
of
material
and
workmanship
to
choose
and
would
also
know
to
a
fraction
what
their
expenses
would
be
nor
did
present
lack
of
funds
stand
in
the
way
of
success
for
the
state
helped
capable
industrious
authors
by
a
judicious
system
of
credit
just
as
it
helped
any
other
of
its
people
who
had
done
nothing
to
forfeit
the
supposition
that
they
were
deserving
of
such
assistance
as
already
pointed
out
state
aid
within
certain
limits
was
unattended
with
any
risk
to
the
government
as
it
had
means
of
repaying
itself
the
law
of
copyright
was
simplicity
itself
for
one
hundred
years
the
copyright
was
the
inalienable
property
of
the
author
or
the
author
s
nominees
at
the
end
of
that
time
the
state
succeeded
to
all
copyrights
as
were
still
of
value
no
grasping
publisher
was
allowed
to
step
in
and
reap
the
profits
of
an
author
s
brain
toil
and
there
was
no
gall
mixed
with
the
thought
that
a
work
was
being
written
which
might
possibly
survive
to
become
a
valuable
property
of
the
nation
even
as
gibbons
decline
and
fall
of
the
roman
empire
is
still
a
gold
mine
to
enterprising
and
speculative
publishers
in
england
there
was
no
sort
of
hesitation
on
the
part
of
anyone
to
claim
of
the
mother
the
help
and
protection
to
which
as
her
veritable
children
they
were
justly
entitled
pauperism
and
workhouses
did
not
exist
simply
because
the
state
saw
the
wisdom
of
preventing
squalor
and
destitution
by
its
system
of
claiming
the
care
of
its
people
from
their
infancy
and
being
generous
in
its
mode
of
launching
them
in
life
when
we
reflect
upon
the
enormous
sums
which
are
collected
for
poor
rates
in
england
it
is
easy
to
conceive
the
vast
social
improvement
the
same
amount
of
money
and
labour
could
produce
if
spent
in
the
education
and
fair
start
in
life
of
our
thousands
of
miserable
and
squalid
who
instead
of
being
all
their
a
continual
source
of
expense
to
the
nation
would
grow
up
respectable
and
respected
units
of
society
abhorring
the
life
of
shame
and
degradation
which
they
and
only
too
many
others
look
upon
at
present
as
their
natural
birthright
prevention
is
better
than
cure
is
just
as
trite
and
useful
a
maxim
for
the
state
as
it
is
for
the
subject
as
is
also
the
warning
against
being
and
it
would
cost
much
less
for
our
country
to
feed
clothe
educate
and
train
to
useful
avocations
youngsters
taken
from
the
slums
than
it
would
cost
to
meet
of
the
expenses
that
same
of
juveniles
will
provide
for
their
compatriots
before
they
have
run
the
course
of
drunkenness
pauperism
misery
and
crime
which
the
laws
of
cause
and
effect
have
only
too
surely
marked
out
for
them
in
the
unhappy
future
when
comparing
new
amazonia
with
england
another
idea
suggests
itself
how
much
of
the
national
prosperity
i
saw
around
me
was
owing
to
the
fact
that
new
amazonia
was
free
from
the
incubus
of
having
to
provide
vast
sums
for
the
support
of
a
monarchy
which
with
us
is
exceedingly
limited
in
its
beneficent
effects
but
which
possesses
an
unlimited
capacity
for
appropriating
huge
emoluments
which
would
be
more
sensibly
spent
in
liquidating
the
national
debt
or
in
alleviating
some
of
the
national
misery
if
saddled
with
the
incalculable
burdens
which
england
has
to
bear
even
new
amazonian
rulers
would
find
it
a
difficult
task
to
present
a
satisfactory
budget
at
the
end
of
their
term
of
office
there
is
also
another
way
in
which
our
poor
are
deprived
of
a
great
deal
of
help
they
would
otherwise
receive
many
of
our
churches
and
chapels
are
simply
begging
houses
in
which
their
frequenters
are
persuaded
to
part
with
every
penny
they
can
be
induced
to
spare
and
this
if
the
donors
are
satisfied
is
perfectly
right
in
its
way
but
is
it
right
that
while
countless
poor
souls
old
and
young
are
rotting
body
and
soul
in
our
own
land
it
should
be
the
boast
of
our
missionary
societies
that
they
give
hundreds
of
thousands
of
pounds
every
year
to
strangers
who
do
not
need
the
gospel
preached
practically
to
them
half
so
much
as
the
miserable
denizens
of
the
back
slums
of
our
own
parishes
the
zeal
of
the
advocates
of
foreign
missions
is
commendable
but
i
respectfully
submit
that
it
is
misdirected
and
if
some
of
them
had
half
an
idea
of
what
only
too
often
ultimately
becomes
of
their
money
they
would
be
very
chary
about
subscribing
in
future
but
when
even
those
whose
office
and
mission
it
is
to
seek
and
succour
their
poor
and
needy
neighbours
find
their
time
and
attention
taken
up
with
more
distant
and
less
pressing
duties
how
is
it
likely
that
our
legislators
occupied
so
intensely
as
they
are
in
trying
to
prove
each
other
unfit
for
office
will
ever
find
time
to
take
the
cause
of
the
social
improvement
of
the
people
into
consideration
it
is
hopeless
to
think
of
it
at
present
for
a
true
and
tender
interest
will
never
be
felt
in
the
units
of
the
nation
until
our
constitution
becomes
less
that
of
rulers
and
ruled
and
more
like
that
of
mother
and
children
to
this
consummation
there
is
another
obstacle
the
truly
maternal
instinct
has
no
equivalent
in
the
breast
of
man
and
so
long
as
none
but
men
are
the
people
s
representatives
even
so
long
will
that
people
be
deprived
of
a
thousand
rights
which
a
just
earnest
womanly
would
give
them
it
is
monstrous
to
speak
of
women
as
being
even
incapable
of
voting
wisely
when
they
have
already
proved
themselves
capable
of
governing
much
more
judiciously
than
men
many
of
whom
seem
to
recognise
no
other
legitimate
result
of
taking
office
than
squabbling
and
banqueting
certainly
in
many
cases
these
are
about
the
only
matters
to
which
some
of
our
corporate
bodies
devote
their
attention
and
surely
surely
feminine
nincompoopery
could
go
no
further
than
this
there
is
a
town
in
kansas
called
oskaloosa
of
which
the
mayor
and
other
members
of
the
corporation
are
all
women
their
first
term
of
office
has
been
so
triumphantly
progressive
that
they
have
been
enthusiastically
and
within
twelve
months
the
place
has
made
such
wonderful
strides
in
the
trifling
matters
of
social
morality
sanitation
and
prosperity
that
it
is
the
wonder
of
surrounding
towns
after
so
signal
a
proof
of
feminine
capacity
it
argues
great
paucity
of
brains
for
anyone
to
insinuate
that
a
clever
capable
woman
is
less
able
to
form
a
sensible
opinion
as
to
the
relative
merits
of
candidates
for
office
than
a
man
who
perhaps
spends
half
his
days
in
loafing
about
public
houses
or
race
courses
and
half
his
nights
in
dens
of
infamy
a
truly
moral
judgment
we
need
expect
from
such
truly
moral
voters
i
meet
an
individual
in
the
street
his
legitimate
avocation
is
that
of
he
has
been
doing
good
business
and
has
spent
part
of
his
precarious
earnings
in
sundry
of
gin
and
in
a
paper
of
vile
tobacco
he
positively
reeks
of
low
life
and
pollutes
the
atmosphere
as
he
staggers
through
the
streets
an
unfortunate
dog
crosses
his
path
he
gives
it
a
vicious
kick
and
sends
it
howling
and
limping
to
a
neighbouring
cabmen
s
shelter
for
sympathy
the
dog
s
howls
remind
him
of
the
miserable
wife
and
children
at
home
who
are
destined
to
feel
the
weight
of
his
kicks
and
blows
and
a
demoniac
exulting
grin
of
conscious
masculine
superiority
spreads
over
his
face
while
he
unconsciously
increases
his
speed
in
order
the
sooner
to
be
at
the
game
he
loves
above
all
others
am
i
to
believe
that
this
thing
is
better
able
to
judge
of
the
merits
of
a
candidate
for
electoral
honours
than
i
am
simply
because
it
is
a
man
am
i
to
assume
that
this
reptile
is
legally
and
morally
better
fitted
to
take
a
place
among
our
legislators
than
i
solely
because
it
is
a
man
perish
the
thought
man
s
arrogance
and
woman
s
cowardice
have
reigned
long
enough
and
it
behoves
my
countrywomen
to
assert
their
rights
and
privileges
without
further
delay
never
mind
what
the
men
say
they
can
not
say
more
than
they
have
said
never
mind
what
the
women
say
their
opinions
are
not
worth
heeding
we
are
beginning
to
understand
all
we
have
been
deprived
of
we
have
clear
ideas
as
to
what
we
want
we
are
perfectly
aware
that
we
have
an
uphill
fight
and
plenty
of
senseless
opposition
to
encounter
but
we
also
know
that
patience
overcometh
all
woman
has
up
to
now
proved
that
she
is
superabundantly
gifted
with
a
spurious
undesirable
sort
of
patience
it
has
hitherto
been
of
the
passive
and
kind
all
that
wants
altering
patience
still
if
you
like
but
it
must
be
active
and
coupled
with
such
steady
determination
as
shall
ensure
the
realisation
of
all
our
hopes
and
make
political
and
social
equality
of
the
sexes
a
realisation
of
the
near
future
and
now
i
am
struck
with
another
idea
it
has
suddenly
occurred
to
me
that
i
have
wandered
a
long
way
from
the
savilles
and
that
my
readers
will
wonder
where
i
intend
to
pick
them
up
again
i
have
really
however
not
very
far
to
go
for
they
are
originally
responsible
for
all
the
digression
which
their
conversation
has
suggested
and
if
the
opinions
feebly
expressed
in
the
preceding
pages
succeed
in
winning
a
few
recruits
to
the
cause
of
progress
the
saville
family
would
not
be
disposed
to
cavil
at
my
momentary
neglect
of
them
i
recall
a
remark
john
saville
made
during
that
memorable
visit
suppose
he
said
i
were
to
find
this
fabulous
country
of
yours
and
were
to
set
up
as
a
lecturer
how
do
you
think
i
should
succeed
that
depends
upon
the
subjects
chosen
i
do
not
doubt
your
power
to
express
your
views
well
i
will
give
you
a
short
syllabus
i
would
extol
our
methods
of
dealing
with
children
in
preference
to
yours
i
would
impress
upon
all
young
women
the
folly
of
permitting
my
sex
to
arrogate
to
itself
the
right
to
be
the
first
to
speak
of
matters
amorous
or
matrimonial
i
would
scout
the
idea
of
women
being
paid
less
wages
than
men
when
the
work
done
by
both
is
identically
the
same
in
quality
and
quantity
i
would
insist
not
merely
upon
woman
s
electoral
rights
but
upon
woman
s
equal
right
with
man
to
govern
her
country
you
see
i
am
not
quite
going
the
length
of
leaving
us
poor
men
out
in
the
cold
altogether
how
do
you
think
my
programme
will
take
indifferently
why
because
you
would
be
lecturing
in
opposition
to
the
no
progress
views
of
the
majority
of
your
but
i
have
understood
you
to
say
that
your
country
boasts
far
more
women
than
men
how
then
could
i
the
woman
s
apostle
be
in
the
minority
because
you
would
not
merely
have
the
opposition
of
men
to
overcome
but
would
have
arrayed
against
you
the
prejudices
of
all
those
women
who
are
too
bigoted
in
their
own
ignorance
to
know
what
is
good
for
themselves
or
others
and
their
name
is
legion
you
see
the
process
of
education
in
the
doctrines
of
the
necessity
for
and
personal
effort
is
still
young
and
until
we
can
awaken
the
which
it
has
been
for
ages
the
mission
of
men
to
extinguish
in
women
we
can
not
hope
to
effect
the
results
which
demand
united
action
still
the
onward
portion
of
my
sex
grows
in
numbers
every
year
as
does
also
the
number
of
our
masculine
supporters
and
i
hope
to
win
an
immense
number
of
recruits
when
i
get
home
again
and
describe
all
i
have
seen
and
that
reminds
me
how
do
you
propose
to
get
home
well
really
i
upon
my
word
i
don
t
know
i
suppose
however
that
i
shall
be
able
to
discover
some
way
of
reaching
england
when
i
have
solved
the
preliminary
problem
of
earning
the
necessary
funds
i
have
already
written
some
descriptive
articles
which
i
hope
will
be
they
are
sure
to
be
accepted
and
well
paid
for
into
the
bargain
for
everything
connected
with
you
has
roused
the
greatest
interest
in
the
country
so
the
question
of
your
independence
is
settled
already
but
even
were
this
not
so
the
mother
is
always
kind
and
would
provide
you
with
the
means
of
travelling
the
difficulty
lies
in
discovering
your
actual
if
this
is
really
ireland
in
a
perfected
state
i
have
not
far
to
go
a
country
may
be
revolutionised
and
improved
by
social
reforms
but
nothing
of
much
less
power
than
an
earthquake
can
remove
it
altogether
if
england
stands
where
it
did
i
have
but
to
take
a
boat
to
holyhead
and
a
few
hours
more
will
take
me
home
to
and
what
will
you
do
when
you
get
there
report
myself
to
my
friends
without
further
you
forget
that
you
must
have
been
sleeping
some
centuries
and
that
you
are
not
likely
to
find
any
friends
left
alive
or
any
place
you
have
known
in
the
same
condition
as
that
in
which
you
left
it
look
at
this
map
here
is
the
island
of
which
you
speak
holyhead
and
northumberland
still
find
their
place
upon
it
but
is
all
else
as
you
left
it
i
eagerly
looked
at
the
map
before
me
and
without
difficulty
pounced
upon
newcastle
but
where
were
all
the
outlying
villages
which
used
to
assert
themselves
so
independently
and
with
such
plum
utterance
gone
everyone
of
them
swallowed
up
in
the
huge
advance
of
their
powerful
centre
i
looked
for
benwell
gosforth
scotswood
lemington
newburn
benton
killingworth
and
a
dozen
other
places
all
in
vain
for
newcastle
overspread
them
all
and
as
the
veritable
metropolis
of
the
north
presented
a
picture
of
progress
and
prosperity
which
were
amazing
to
me
i
was
told
that
centuries
of
effort
had
made
the
tyne
one
of
the
noblest
rivers
in
the
land
fleets
could
ride
upon
its
waters
in
safety
and
it
was
now
an
important
naval
station
its
commercial
relations
with
the
rest
of
the
world
were
enormous
in
arts
and
manufactures
it
was
alike
distinguished
and
it
was
the
most
famous
place
in
all
europe
for
the
production
of
every
kind
of
electrical
apparati
besides
being
the
northern
centre
of
learning
countless
other
improvements
and
aggrandisements
were
related
to
me
but
for
the
most
part
they
fell
on
deaf
ears
at
the
time
i
had
at
last
realised
that
i
was
bereft
of
everybody
and
everything
i
had
ever
held
dear
and
must
henceforth
consider
myself
alone
in
the
world
an
alien
in
a
strange
land
without
the
possibility
of
ever
again
exchanging
a
word
or
look
of
affection
with
those
whom
i
had
loved
well
and
truly
no
wonder
my
fortitude
gave
way
no
wonder
i
returned
to
the
college
in
a
mood
bordering
on
despair
chapter
xvii
my
earnest
consideration
for
the
next
few
days
was
devoted
to
the
question
of
ways
and
means
knowing
it
to
be
the
custom
of
the
country
to
entertain
strangers
hospitably
i
had
hitherto
accepted
the
attentions
offered
me
in
the
frank
cordial
spirit
in
which
they
were
given
but
this
could
not
continue
beyond
a
reasonable
term
and
now
that
my
stay
in
the
country
seemed
likely
to
be
permanent
my
demanded
that
i
should
at
once
take
steps
to
prove
my
capability
of
assuming
an
active
part
in
the
battle
of
life
as
before
hinted
i
was
not
likely
to
encounter
many
difficulties
in
the
way
of
earning
a
livelihood
for
my
own
experiences
were
a
subject
of
such
interest
to
new
amazonians
that
sketches
of
them
would
easily
find
a
market
in
the
native
journals
in
fact
even
while
debating
the
point
with
myself
principal
grey
came
to
me
as
the
bearer
of
a
message
from
the
mother
she
was
deputed
to
ask
me
if
i
purposed
making
andersonia
my
permanent
abiding
place
and
i
was
also
requested
to
state
my
views
for
the
future
in
any
case
she
was
somewhat
surprised
to
find
me
full
of
grief
at
the
conviction
that
i
had
indeed
parted
for
ever
from
all
and
everything
which
i
had
ever
loved
and
she
did
her
utmost
to
console
me
some
of
her
utterances
dwelling
in
my
memory
yet
it
has
certainly
struck
us
as
a
great
wonder
she
said
that
you
should
have
appeared
so
strangely
in
our
midst
some
of
our
savants
have
had
discussions
on
the
subject
but
can
come
to
no
rational
solution
of
the
questions
mooted
to
believe
that
you
were
magically
transported
hither
is
revolting
to
our
century
common
sense
especially
as
we
can
locate
no
country
which
is
in
the
condition
described
by
you
as
that
of
your
native
land
to
believe
that
you
have
been
in
a
state
of
torpidity
for
six
hundred
years
seems
more
likely
but
if
we
accept
this
hypothesis
we
are
confronted
with
the
problem
of
accounting
for
your
whereabouts
prior
to
your
resuscitation
there
has
been
found
not
a
single
trace
of
your
resting
place
had
you
been
borne
hither
on
the
wings
of
the
wind
your
advent
could
not
have
been
more
mysterious
nor
more
bereft
of
all
clue
as
to
your
former
place
of
abode
your
own
utterances
and
those
of
your
odd
compatriot
only
seem
to
leave
one
opinion
open
to
us
and
that
is
that
you
have
been
in
a
state
of
trance
the
descriptions
you
have
given
of
your
own
country
and
its
state
of
civilisation
as
known
to
you
tally
exactly
with
what
is
known
of
as
it
existed
in
the
nineteenth
century
the
fact
that
you
call
it
england
puts
us
of
course
on
the
right
track
at
once
but
whatever
may
account
for
your
arrival
here
it
is
an
undoubted
fact
that
you
are
of
as
real
flesh
and
blood
as
we
are
and
that
you
are
now
leading
as
commonplace
a
life
as
any
of
us
this
being
so
it
is
expedient
that
some
plans
should
be
laid
for
your
future
and
i
as
the
mother
s
representative
am
deputed
to
elicit
your
views
and
intentions
on
the
subject
that
you
should
only
just
have
realised
the
impossibility
of
finding
england
or
its
inhabitants
as
you
left
them
possibly
makes
my
errand
appear
somewhat
and
precipitate
to
you
i
have
however
my
instructions
to
carry
out
and
you
must
forgive
me
if
it
should
strike
you
as
rather
unfeeling
to
enquire
what
you
intend
to
do
for
a
livelihood
i
could
not
possibly
take
offence
where
all
have
shown
me
so
much
kindness
and
consideration
was
my
reply
i
was
in
fact
just
deliberating
the
same
subject
when
you
came
i
have
been
encouraged
to
think
that
i
may
hope
to
get
on
in
the
vocation
to
which
i
have
already
devoted
some
years
of
of
an
yes
that
is
the
opinion
we
have
also
formed
and
it
is
in
connection
therewith
that
i
have
a
proposal
to
make
to
you
will
you
write
a
book
descriptive
of
your
former
life
associates
and
customs
the
literary
bureau
will
publish
it
for
you
and
as
there
is
sure
to
be
a
huge
demand
for
it
your
profits
will
be
large
enough
to
justify
the
state
in
at
once
presenting
you
with
advance
letters
of
credit
these
letters
of
credit
as
you
know
represent
money
with
us
and
if
you
undertake
to
write
this
work
considering
it
a
state
commission
you
will
at
once
find
yourself
in
a
position
of
what
other
answer
than
yes
could
i
give
to
such
a
wonderful
proposal
as
this
a
certain
very
nice
but
rather
gushing
young
lady
whom
i
know
would
have
at
once
exclaimed
oh
it
s
i
did
not
do
that
but
i
managed
to
express
my
thanks
and
my
acquiescence
with
such
a
mixture
of
enthusiasm
and
dignity
as
did
justice
alike
to
my
desire
to
show
my
gratitude
and
to
my
sense
of
my
own
importance
let
not
the
reader
imagine
that
i
had
no
legitimate
room
for
the
latter
feeling
for
i
was
undoubtedly
a
very
prominent
and
important
personage
in
new
amazonia
circumstances
over
which
i
had
had
no
control
had
placed
me
in
a
position
of
publicity
which
was
none
the
less
real
because
it
was
none
of
my
seeking
the
probabilities
were
in
favour
of
my
popularity
dying
out
as
soon
as
i
became
less
of
a
novelty
meanwhile
it
was
advisable
that
i
should
take
the
goods
with
which
the
gods
had
provided
me
and
make
the
most
of
the
opportunities
thrown
in
my
way
it
did
not
take
long
to
arrange
my
subsequent
programme
i
was
to
commence
writing
on
the
following
day
and
to
submit
my
work
weekly
to
the
bureau
which
would
make
such
arrangements
as
its
heads
might
think
fit
for
bringing
my
work
under
the
notice
of
the
public
still
in
spite
of
the
interesting
nature
of
our
conversation
i
could
not
repress
my
melancholy
and
was
so
depressed
that
my
companion
offered
the
consolatory
remark
that
though
i
was
parted
from
my
beloved
ones
so
long
as
i
remained
in
my
own
probationary
state
they
were
not
deprived
of
the
power
of
knowing
my
whereabouts
and
were
probably
rejoicing
at
the
fact
that
i
had
been
placed
in
a
sphere
of
action
which
could
not
fail
to
assist
my
attempts
to
perfect
myself
for
the
higher
i
was
conscious
of
finding
a
little
consolation
in
the
principal
s
arguments
and
remarked
that
it
would
have
been
some
additional
comfort
to
me
if
i
could
have
known
where
my
dear
ones
were
buried
so
that
though
deprived
of
their
society
i
might
at
least
do
honour
to
them
by
visiting
and
adorning
their
last
resting
place
the
principal
did
not
exactly
grasp
my
meaning
at
first
when
she
did
she
was
horrified
is
it
possible
she
cried
in
amaze
that
you
can
contemplate
with
equanimity
the
prospect
of
being
laid
in
the
ground
to
rot
in
repulsive
putrefaction
to
be
the
prey
of
vermin
to
pollute
the
earth
air
and
water
around
you
and
to
be
the
source
of
death
and
disease
to
those
whom
you
have
left
behind
it
is
too
horrible
to
think
of
why
what
would
you
have
us
do
i
enquired
blankly
you
wouldn
t
have
us
kept
above
ground
would
you
i
would
have
you
decently
cremated
as
we
all
are
when
we
die
how
can
you
expect
to
be
healthy
in
mind
and
body
surrounded
by
the
miasmatic
emanations
of
putrifying
corpses
it
was
demonstrated
to
new
amazonian
satisfaction
centuries
ago
that
it
would
be
impossible
to
rid
the
land
of
fever
and
pestilential
diseases
until
this
principal
source
of
water
pollution
was
removed
we
still
have
pictures
of
ancient
graveyards
and
i
can
very
well
imagine
what
they
were
like
the
hoary
venerable
looking
church
the
funny
upright
slabs
of
stone
or
marble
marking
the
place
where
several
bodies
were
undergoing
the
putrefactive
process
the
pretty
flowers
and
the
picturesque
trees
the
little
brooklet
which
winds
its
rippling
way
through
or
past
the
churchyard
its
water
looking
pure
and
limpid
because
it
has
percolated
its
way
through
the
dead
and
decaying
remains
of
your
ancestors
and
bearing
no
easily
discernible
evidence
of
the
deadly
impurities
of
which
it
is
the
conveying
medium
i
see
them
all
and
can
even
follow
the
little
brooklet
as
it
feeds
the
waters
of
a
larger
stream
and
finally
becomes
a
component
part
of
some
great
river
from
which
the
water
supply
of
one
of
your
immense
manufacturing
towns
is
obtained
very
interesting
as
a
picture
no
doubt
but
when
you
quietly
contemplate
the
calm
endurance
of
such
a
horrible
state
of
certainly
as
presented
by
the
principal
the
picture
was
not
a
nice
one
but
one
does
not
relinquish
all
one
s
most
sentimental
customs
without
a
struggle
and
a
warm
discussion
ensued
between
us
from
which
however
i
emerged
the
loser
as
i
might
have
expected
when
i
came
to
think
of
it
it
was
not
pleasant
to
reflect
that
every
drink
of
water
i
had
ever
had
had
possibly
meandered
its
way
through
the
dissolving
tissues
of
some
recently
departed
victim
of
cholera
or
fever
even
the
idea
of
past
near
relationship
to
the
too
generously
diffusive
corpse
was
not
consolatory
for
it
had
a
sort
of
cannibalistic
aspect
about
it
which
did
not
argue
true
affection
for
the
departed
i
remembered
that
in
my
country
one
of
the
chief
objections
to
cremation
apart
from
the
purely
sentimental
reasons
promulgated
was
that
in
cases
of
foul
play
the
process
annihilated
all
chances
of
ever
discovering
the
real
cause
of
death
as
no
analysis
of
cremated
remains
can
be
made
on
reflection
it
struck
me
that
it
was
less
important
that
one
malefactor
should
be
brought
to
book
than
that
whole
communities
should
be
exposed
to
the
risk
of
poison
i
reflected
also
that
the
system
of
life
insurance
was
mainly
responsible
for
the
crimes
of
our
modern
poisoners
given
the
abolition
of
a
system
whereby
our
relatives
and
guardians
are
interested
in
our
speedy
demise
and
the
substitution
of
the
plan
which
prevailed
in
new
amazonia
whereby
every
child
of
the
state
had
its
old
age
provided
for
and
poisoning
by
becoming
so
evidently
useless
would
at
the
same
time
become
our
rarest
crime
so
i
thought
while
admitting
to
principal
grey
that
burial
was
a
dangerous
and
unsatisfactory
mode
of
disposing
of
the
dead
we
began
to
talk
of
other
things
and
in
the
course
of
conversation
it
occurred
to
me
to
make
some
enquiries
relating
to
augustus
and
his
future
plans
i
am
afraid
was
the
rejoinder
that
can
never
be
converted
into
a
sober
new
amazonian
he
has
revolted
against
wearing
our
national
costume
and
says
that
rather
than
sacrifice
his
british
individuality
and
look
like
everybody
else
he
will
brave
the
probability
of
becoming
a
and
that
he
will
wear
his
old
clothes
to
rags
rather
than
have
his
individuality
swallowed
up
in
a
general
resemblance
to
every
nincompoop
in
the
country
i
am
afraid
it
would
necessitate
him
to
live
as
long
again
as
he
has
done
to
bring
him
into
the
exact
likeness
of
a
native
of
new
amazonia
but
his
vanity
is
inextinguishable
and
nothing
could
bring
him
to
the
belief
that
his
appearance
does
not
eclipse
that
of
our
handsomest
men
when
last
i
heard
of
him
he
was
seeking
some
stuff
with
a
large
pattern
he
says
that
if
he
can
find
a
nice
big
check
he
may
perhaps
consent
to
have
a
suit
made
in
native
style
but
he
is
not
at
all
sure
but
how
does
he
intend
earning
his
living
he
is
not
at
all
sure
about
that
either
he
says
that
he
will
think
about
it
but
he
protests
meanwhile
very
bitterly
against
a
destiny
that
has
placed
him
among
people
who
can
be
sordid
and
vulgar
enough
to
ask
him
the
pampered
scion
of
a
great
house
to
degrade
himself
by
attempting
to
earn
his
own
living
he
considers
that
the
mother
ought
to
be
proud
of
being
honoured
by
his
sojourn
amongst
us
and
that
she
ought
to
be
only
too
glad
to
extend
her
hospitality
indefinitely
to
and
the
does
she
think
of
his
peculiarities
are
they
found
annoying
well
to
a
certain
extent
yes
we
abhor
ingratitude
but
in
this
case
we
are
being
forced
into
the
belief
that
this
englishman
is
not
exactly
a
responsible
agent
i
am
afraid
that
he
is
not
quite
sane
but
of
course
unless
he
becomes
very
much
worse
it
will
not
be
found
necessary
to
adopt
stringent
measures
with
and
if
his
peculiarities
should
become
much
more
pronounced
ah
we
shall
be
compelled
to
do
something
he
has
already
lost
so
much
time
during
his
prolonged
state
of
unconsciousness
that
it
will
be
a
charity
to
release
his
spirit
if
it
becomes
evident
that
it
is
withheld
from
further
progress
towards
heavenly
bliss
by
being
confined
in
a
body
which
is
more
likely
to
promote
retrogression
than
as
i
listened
to
this
calm
utterance
my
blood
positively
ran
cold
full
well
i
knew
what
she
meant
the
peculiar
tenets
of
new
amazonian
religion
had
been
carefully
explained
to
me
and
i
knew
that
the
life
of
was
destined
to
be
a
short
one
unless
he
restored
the
native
belief
in
his
sanity
i
was
quite
unable
to
talk
much
more
after
this
and
my
friend
observing
that
i
seemed
fatigued
and
had
better
rest
left
me
to
my
own
resources
but
i
felt
incapable
of
resting
for
i
was
too
excited
clearly
the
life
of
the
eccentric
augustus
was
in
danger
and
i
was
impatient
to
see
him
and
warn
him
without
delay
i
knew
where
he
was
located
for
the
present
and
i
resolved
to
see
him
at
the
earliest
opportunity
all
night
i
was
restless
and
perturbed
and
though
six
o
clock
was
still
early
for
the
british
masher
i
dressed
myself
with
my
usual
care
and
set
off
to
visit
him
knowing
that
we
should
have
a
better
chance
of
talking
undisturbed
by
taking
a
morning
stroll
together
than
if
i
waited
until
we
were
both
in
the
midst
of
society
besides
i
had
to
begin
my
book
and
i
intended
working
honestly
to
discharge
my
debt
to
new
amazonia
as
i
had
partly
expected
was
not
yet
astir
and
when
he
ultimately
presented
himself
he
was
in
a
state
of
supreme
conjecture
as
to
my
reasons
for
having
him
roused
so
unseasonably
upon
my
life
he
grumbled
discontentedly
one
gets
no
peace
in
this
miserable
place
only
yesterday
i
was
asked
in
cold
blood
to
select
some
way
of
earning
my
own
livelihood
me
who
never
had
even
to
dress
myself
without
assistance
until
i
came
to
this
benighted
land
and
now
you
come
and
rouse
me
at
this
unconscionable
time
i
would
like
to
catch
a
servant
of
ours
seizing
me
by
the
shoulder
and
making
me
get
up
at
this
time
in
the
morning
like
that
fellow
did
just
now
i
would
not
only
have
packed
him
about
his
business
but
would
have
refused
him
a
character
into
the
bargain
but
in
this
confounded
country
there
is
no
freedom
one
can
not
do
as
one
likes
and
an
impudent
boot
cleaner
actually
presumes
to
dictate
to
a
and
then
the
women
are
such
fools
too
they
can
not
appreciate
a
good
chance
when
they
get
it
i
have
proposed
to
no
less
than
six
of
them
and
what
do
you
think
they
all
did
nothing
but
laugh
upon
my
word
they
didn
t
believe
that
i
really
meant
to
throw
myself
away
upon
them
and
when
i
tried
to
convince
them
that
i
was
actually
in
earnest
they
just
grew
more
dense
and
unbelieving
and
laughed
all
the
more
an
englishwoman
would
have
sense
enough
to
jump
at
such
an
offer
and
i
don
t
think
i
shall
demean
myself
by
proposing
to
another
new
i
don
t
think
i
would
i
rejoined
as
gravely
as
i
could
they
do
not
know
how
to
appreciate
you
still
i
think
that
you
are
not
quite
fair
to
the
land
of
your
adoption
personally
i
have
found
nothing
to
grumble
oh
with
you
it
is
different
you
see
i
have
been
used
to
every
consideration
all
my
life
long
while
you
have
never
been
anything
but
a
mere
precisely
so
but
you
will
forgive
me
if
i
remark
that
your
sense
of
personal
importance
is
running
away
with
your
discretion
and
is
likely
to
lead
you
into
how
do
you
make
that
out
very
easily
it
is
what
has
brought
me
to
see
you
now
and
then
i
did
my
best
to
explain
the
dangers
of
his
position
and
the
folly
of
persisting
in
his
present
course
of
discontent
and
eccentricity
if
you
do
not
mind
i
concluded
seriously
you
will
be
treated
to
a
strong
dose
of
medicated
schlafstrank
some
of
these
days
and
then
where
will
you
be
poor
augustus
oh
how
frightened
he
was
we
were
in
the
public
gardens
and
he
staggered
to
a
seat
before
he
could
say
a
word
then
he
gasped
oh
lord
deliver
me
from
this
land
of
iniquity
help
me
to
get
home
to
my
poor
old
mother
and
i
ll
never
swear
at
her
again
she
shall
have
the
tickets
for
her
gold
watch
and
chain
which
i
pawned
and
if
they
ll
take
me
on
in
the
shop
again
i
ll
promise
to
work
honestly
and
pay
for
that
suit
of
clothes
i
got
on
tick
and
oh
lord
i
ll
turn
up
every
penny
of
the
money
i
cleared
in
that
business
on
leger
day
and
that
money
i
owe
to
the
who
thought
i
was
lord
hastings
i
ll
pay
every
farthing
of
it
oh
lord
let
me
get
out
of
this
very
soon
or
its
two
to
one
bar
one
that
old
molly
jones
will
never
see
her
son
again
here
was
a
revelation
i
could
scarcely
credit
my
ears
but
the
very
evident
terror
of
the
man
before
me
had
brought
out
such
truths
as
are
only
wrung
from
such
lips
as
his
by
dire
emergency
and
i
involuntarily
recoiled
from
too
near
contact
with
an
avowed
blackguard
imposter
and
cheat
he
noticed
my
gesture
of
repulsion
and
cried
imploringly
oh
for
heaven
s
sake
don
t
leave
me
help
me
to
get
out
of
this
i
do
not
see
what
further
help
i
can
afford
you
i
responded
coldly
your
fate
depends
upon
your
own
ah
but
there
s
no
knowing
what
might
happen
no
matter
what
i
say
or
do
he
protested
i
must
clear
out
somehow
and
listen
i
really
have
a
plan
the
reason
i
made
a
row
about
getting
my
own
clothes
back
was
because
there
was
a
tiny
paper
packet
in
the
left
waistcoat
pocket
i
had
it
given
me
at
that
opium
den
i
was
in
in
soho
the
fellow
that
gave
it
me
told
me
that
it
was
a
very
wonderful
sort
of
snuff
that
would
bring
even
funnier
things
to
pass
than
hasheesh
could
i
only
remembered
it
the
other
day
and
i
thought
it
might
perhaps
help
me
to
get
home
again
but
it
looks
so
queer
that
i
am
rather
frightened
of
it
it
might
be
poison
you
know
and
i
thought
i
would
see
what
you
thought
about
it
before
trusting
myself
to
snuff
any
of
as
he
spoke
he
handed
me
the
little
paper
parcel
he
had
mentioned
and
i
examined
it
somewhat
curiously
it
certainly
was
uninviting
having
a
black
and
slimy
appearance
not
at
all
pleasant
to
the
eye
still
it
might
smell
much
nicer
than
it
looked
and
as
i
fancied
that
i
caught
a
faint
subtle
aroma
i
held
the
stuff
to
my
nose
drew
in
a
most
delightful
perfume
in
my
own
study
surrounded
by

century
magazines
and
newspapers
and

all
over
