i
the
great
forest
the
old
men
say
their
fathers
told
them
that
soon
after
the
fields
were
left
to
themselves
a
change
began
to
be
visible
it
became
green
everywhere
in
the
first
spring
after
london
ended
so
that
all
the
country
looked
alike
the
meadows
were
green
and
so
was
the
rising
wheat
which
had
been
sown
but
which
neither
had
nor
would
receive
any
further
care
such
arable
fields
as
had
not
been
sown
but
where
the
last
stubble
had
been
ploughed
up
were
overrun
with
and
where
the
short
stubble
had
not
been
ploughed
the
weeds
hid
it
so
that
there
was
no
place
which
was
not
more
or
less
green
the
footpaths
were
the
greenest
of
all
for
such
is
the
nature
of
grass
where
it
has
once
been
trodden
on
and
as
the
summer
came
on
the
former
roads
were
thinly
covered
with
the
grass
that
had
spread
out
from
the
margin
in
the
autumn
as
the
meadows
were
not
mown
the
grass
withered
as
it
stood
falling
this
way
and
that
as
the
wind
had
blown
it
the
seeds
dropped
and
the
bennets
became
a
or
where
the
docks
and
sorrel
were
thick
a
the
wheat
after
it
had
ripened
there
being
no
one
to
reap
it
also
remained
standing
and
was
eaten
by
clouds
of
sparrows
rooks
and
pigeons
which
flocked
to
it
and
were
undisturbed
feasting
at
their
pleasure
as
the
winter
came
on
the
crops
were
beaten
down
by
the
storms
soaked
with
rain
and
trodden
upon
by
herds
of
animals
next
summer
the
prostrate
straw
of
the
preceding
year
was
concealed
by
the
young
green
wheat
and
barley
that
sprang
up
from
the
grain
sown
by
dropping
from
the
ears
and
by
quantities
of
docks
thistles
oxeye
daisies
and
similar
plants
this
matted
mass
grew
up
through
the
bleached
straw
charlock
too
hid
the
rotting
roots
in
the
fields
under
a
blaze
of
yellow
flower
the
young
spring
could
scarcely
push
its
way
up
through
the
long
dead
grass
and
bennets
of
the
year
previous
but
docks
and
thistles
sorrel
wild
carrots
and
nettles
found
no
such
difficulty
footpaths
were
concealed
by
the
second
year
but
roads
could
be
traced
though
as
green
as
the
sward
and
were
still
the
best
for
walking
because
the
tangled
wheat
and
weeds
and
in
the
meadows
the
long
grass
caught
the
feet
of
those
who
tried
to
pass
through
year
by
year
the
original
crops
of
wheat
barley
oats
and
beans
asserted
their
presence
by
shooting
up
but
in
gradually
diminished
force
as
nettles
and
coarser
plants
such
as
the
wild
parsnips
spread
out
into
the
fields
from
the
ditches
and
choked
them
aquatic
grasses
from
the
furrows
and
extended
in
the
meadows
and
with
the
rushes
helped
to
destroy
or
take
the
place
of
the
former
sweet
herbage
meanwhile
the
brambles
which
grew
very
fast
had
pushed
forward
their
prickly
runners
farther
and
farther
from
the
hedges
till
they
had
now
reached
ten
or
fifteen
yards
the
briars
had
followed
and
the
hedges
had
widened
to
three
or
four
times
their
first
breadth
the
fields
being
equally
contracted
starting
from
all
sides
at
once
these
brambles
and
briars
in
the
course
of
about
twenty
years
met
in
the
centre
of
the
largest
fields
hawthorn
bushes
sprang
up
among
them
and
protected
by
the
briars
and
thorns
from
grazing
animals
the
suckers
of
rose
and
flourished
sapling
ashes
oaks
sycamores
and
lifted
their
heads
of
old
time
the
cattle
would
have
eaten
off
the
seed
leaves
with
the
grass
so
soon
as
they
were
out
of
the
ground
but
now
most
of
the
acorns
that
were
dropped
by
birds
and
the
keys
that
were
wafted
by
the
wind
twirling
as
they
floated
took
root
and
grew
into
trees
by
this
time
the
brambles
and
briars
had
choked
up
and
blocked
the
former
roads
which
were
as
impassable
as
the
fields
no
fields
indeed
remained
for
where
the
ground
was
dry
the
thorns
briars
brambles
and
saplings
already
mentioned
filled
the
space
and
these
thickets
and
the
young
trees
had
converted
most
part
of
the
country
into
an
immense
forest
where
the
ground
was
naturally
moist
and
the
drains
had
become
choked
with
willow
roots
which
when
confined
in
tubes
grow
into
a
mass
like
the
brush
of
a
fox
sedges
and
flags
and
rushes
covered
it
thorn
bushes
were
there
too
but
not
so
tall
they
were
hung
with
lichen
besides
the
flags
and
reeds
vast
quantities
of
the
tallest
or
gicks
rose
five
or
six
feet
high
and
the
willow
herb
with
its
stout
stem
almost
as
woody
as
a
shrub
filled
every
approach
by
the
thirtieth
year
there
was
not
one
single
open
place
the
hills
only
excepted
where
a
man
could
walk
unless
he
followed
the
tracks
of
wild
creatures
or
cut
himself
a
path
the
ditches
of
course
had
long
since
become
full
of
leaves
and
dead
branches
so
that
the
water
which
should
have
run
off
down
them
stagnated
and
presently
spread
out
into
the
hollow
places
and
by
the
corner
of
what
had
once
been
fields
forming
marshes
where
the
horsetails
flags
and
sedges
hid
the
water
as
no
care
was
taken
with
the
brooks
the
hatches
upon
them
gradually
rotted
and
the
force
of
the
winter
rains
carried
away
the
weak
timbers
flooding
the
lower
grounds
which
became
swamps
of
larger
size
the
dams
too
were
drilled
by
and
the
streams
percolating
through
slowly
increased
the
size
of
these
tunnels
till
the
structure
burst
and
the
current
swept
on
and
added
to
the
floods
below
stood
longer
but
as
the
ponds
silted
up
the
current
flowed
round
and
even
through
the
which
going
by
degrees
to
ruin
were
in
some
cases
undermined
till
they
fell
everywhere
the
lower
lands
adjacent
to
the
streams
had
become
marshes
some
of
them
extending
for
miles
in
a
winding
line
and
occasionally
spreading
out
to
a
mile
in
breadth
this
was
particularly
the
case
where
brooks
and
streams
of
some
volume
joined
the
rivers
which
were
also
blocked
and
obstructed
in
their
turn
and
the
two
overflowing
covered
the
country
around
for
the
rivers
brought
down
trees
and
branches
timbers
floated
from
the
shore
and
all
kinds
of
similar
materials
which
grounded
in
the
shallows
or
caught
against
snags
and
formed
huge
piles
where
there
had
been
weirs
sometimes
after
great
rains
these
piles
swept
away
the
timbers
of
the
weir
driven
by
the
irresistible
power
of
the
water
and
then
in
its
course
the
flood
carrying
the
balks
before
it
like
battering
rams
cracked
and
split
the
bridges
of
solid
stone
which
the
ancients
had
built
these
and
the
iron
bridges
likewise
were
overthrown
and
presently
quite
disappeared
for
the
very
foundations
were
covered
with
the
sand
and
gravel
silted
up
thus
too
the
sites
of
many
villages
and
towns
that
anciently
existed
along
the
rivers
or
on
the
lower
lands
adjoining
were
concealed
by
the
water
and
the
mud
it
brought
with
it
the
sedges
and
reeds
that
arose
completed
the
work
and
left
nothing
visible
so
that
the
mighty
buildings
of
olden
days
were
by
these
means
utterly
buried
and
as
has
been
proved
by
those
who
have
dug
for
treasures
in
our
time
the
very
foundations
are
deep
beneath
the
earth
and
not
to
be
got
at
for
the
water
that
oozes
into
the
shafts
that
they
have
tried
to
sink
through
the
sand
and
mud
banks
from
an
elevation
therefore
there
was
nothing
visible
but
endless
forest
and
marsh
on
the
level
ground
and
plains
the
view
was
limited
to
a
short
distance
because
of
the
thickets
and
the
saplings
which
had
now
become
young
trees
the
downs
only
were
still
partially
open
yet
it
was
not
convenient
to
walk
upon
them
except
in
the
tracks
of
animals
because
of
the
long
grass
which
being
no
more
regularly
grazed
upon
by
sheep
as
was
once
the
case
grew
thick
and
tangled
furze
too
and
heath
covered
the
slopes
and
in
places
vast
quantities
of
fern
there
had
always
been
copses
of
fir
and
beech
and
covers
and
these
increased
and
spread
while
bramble
briar
and
hawthorn
extended
around
them
by
degrees
the
trees
of
the
vale
seemed
as
it
were
to
invade
and
march
up
the
hills
and
as
we
see
in
our
time
in
many
places
the
downs
are
hidden
altogether
with
a
stunted
kind
of
forest
but
all
the
above
happened
in
the
time
of
the
first
generation
besides
these
things
a
great
physical
change
took
place
but
before
i
speak
of
that
it
will
be
best
to
relate
what
effects
were
produced
upon
animals
and
men
in
the
first
years
after
the
fields
were
left
to
themselves
the
fallen
and
corn
crops
became
the
resort
of
innumerable
mice
they
swarmed
to
an
incredible
degree
not
only
devouring
the
grain
upon
the
straw
that
had
never
been
cut
but
clearing
out
every
single
ear
in
the
that
were
standing
about
the
country
nothing
remained
in
these
ricks
but
straw
pierced
with
tunnels
and
runs
the
home
and
of
mice
which
thence
poured
forth
into
the
fields
such
grain
as
had
been
left
in
barns
and
granaries
in
mills
and
in
warehouses
of
the
deserted
towns
disappeared
in
the
same
manner
when
men
tried
to
raise
crops
in
small
gardens
and
enclosures
for
their
sustenance
these
legions
of
mice
rushed
in
and
destroyed
the
produce
of
their
labour
nothing
could
keep
them
out
and
if
a
score
were
killed
a
hundred
more
supplied
their
place
these
mice
were
preyed
upon
by
kestrel
hawks
owls
and
weasels
but
at
first
they
made
little
or
no
appreciable
difference
in
a
few
years
however
the
weasels
having
such
a
superabundance
of
food
trebled
in
numbers
and
in
the
same
way
the
hawks
owls
and
foxes
increased
there
was
then
some
relief
but
even
now
at
intervals
districts
are
invaded
and
the
granaries
and
the
standing
corn
suffer
from
these
depredations
this
does
not
happen
every
year
but
only
at
intervals
for
it
is
noticed
that
mice
abound
very
much
more
in
some
seasons
than
others
the
extraordinary
multiplication
of
these
creatures
was
the
means
of
providing
food
for
the
cats
that
had
been
abandoned
in
the
towns
and
came
forth
into
the
country
in
droves
feeding
on
the
mice
they
became
in
a
very
short
time
quite
wild
and
their
descendants
now
roam
the
forest
in
our
houses
we
still
have
several
varieties
of
the
domestic
cat
such
as
the
which
is
the
most
prized
but
when
the
cats
became
wild
after
a
while
the
several
varieties
disappeared
and
left
but
one
wild
kind
those
which
are
now
so
often
seen
in
the
forest
and
which
do
so
much
mischief
about
houses
and
enclosures
are
almost
all
greyish
some
being
striped
and
they
are
also
much
longer
in
the
body
than
the
tame
a
few
are
jet
black
their
skins
are
then
preferred
by
hunters
though
the
forest
cat
retires
from
the
sight
of
man
as
much
as
possible
yet
it
is
extremely
fierce
in
defence
of
its
young
and
instances
have
been
known
where
travellers
in
the
woods
have
been
attacked
upon
unwittingly
approaching
their
dens
dropping
from
the
boughs
of
a
tree
upon
the
shoulders
the
creature
flies
at
the
face
inflicting
deep
scratches
and
bites
exceedingly
painful
and
sometimes
dangerous
from
the
tendency
to
fester
but
such
cases
are
rare
and
the
reason
the
forest
cat
is
so
detested
is
because
it
preys
upon
fowls
and
poultry
mounting
with
ease
the
trees
or
places
where
they
roost
almost
worse
than
the
mice
were
the
rats
which
came
out
of
the
old
cities
in
such
vast
numbers
that
the
people
who
survived
and
saw
them
are
related
to
have
fled
in
fear
this
terror
however
did
not
last
so
long
as
the
evil
of
the
mice
for
the
rats
probably
not
finding
sufficient
food
when
together
scattered
abroad
and
were
destroyed
singly
by
the
cats
and
dogs
who
slew
them
by
thousands
far
more
than
they
could
afterwards
eat
so
that
the
carcases
were
left
to
decay
it
is
said
that
overcome
with
hunger
these
armies
of
rats
in
some
cases
fell
upon
each
other
and
fed
on
their
own
kindred
they
are
still
numerous
but
do
not
appear
to
do
the
same
amount
of
damage
as
is
occasionally
caused
by
the
mice
when
the
latter
invade
the
cultivated
lands
the
dogs
of
course
like
the
cats
were
forced
by
starvation
into
the
fields
where
they
perished
in
incredible
numbers
of
many
species
of
dogs
which
are
stated
to
have
been
plentiful
among
the
ancients
we
have
now
nothing
but
the
name
the
poodle
is
extinct
the
maltese
terrier
the
pomeranian
the
italian
greyhound
and
it
is
believed
great
numbers
of
crosses
and
mongrels
have
utterly
disappeared
there
was
none
to
feed
them
and
they
could
not
find
food
for
themselves
nor
could
they
stand
the
rigour
of
the
winter
when
exposed
to
the
frost
in
the
open
air
some
kinds
more
hardy
and
fitted
by
nature
for
the
chase
became
wild
and
their
descendants
are
now
found
in
the
woods
of
these
there
are
three
sorts
which
keep
apart
from
each
other
and
are
thought
not
to
interbreed
the
most
numerous
are
the
black
the
black
is
short
and
stoutly
made
with
shaggy
hair
sometimes
marked
with
white
patches
there
can
be
no
doubt
that
it
is
the
descendant
of
the
ancient
for
it
is
known
that
the
was
of
that
character
and
it
is
said
that
those
who
used
to
keep
sheep
soon
found
their
dogs
abandon
the
fold
and
join
the
wild
troops
that
fell
upon
the
sheep
the
black
hunt
in
packs
of
ten
or
more
as
many
as
forty
have
been
counted
and
are
the
pest
of
the
farmer
for
unless
his
flocks
are
protected
at
night
within
stockades
or
enclosures
they
are
certain
to
be
attacked
not
satisfied
with
killing
enough
to
satisfy
hunger
these
dogs
tear
and
mangle
for
sheer
delight
of
blood
and
will
destroy
twenty
times
as
many
as
they
can
eat
leaving
the
miserably
torn
carcases
on
the
field
nor
are
the
sheep
always
safe
by
day
if
the
happen
to
be
hungry
the
shepherd
is
therefore
usually
accompanied
by
two
or
three
mastiffs
of
whose
great
size
and
strength
the
others
stand
in
awe
at
night
and
when
in
large
packs
starving
in
the
snow
not
even
the
mastiffs
can
check
them
no
of
any
kind
has
ever
been
known
to
attack
man
and
the
hunter
in
the
forest
hears
their
bark
in
every
direction
without
fear
it
is
nevertheless
best
to
retire
out
of
their
way
when
charging
sheep
in
packs
for
they
then
seem
seized
with
a
blind
fury
and
some
who
have
endeavoured
to
fight
them
have
been
thrown
down
and
seriously
mauled
but
this
has
been
in
the
blindness
of
their
rush
no
instance
has
ever
been
known
of
their
purposely
attacking
man
these
black
will
also
chase
and
finally
pull
down
cattle
if
they
can
get
within
the
enclosures
and
even
horses
have
fallen
victims
to
their
untiring
thirst
for
blood
not
even
the
wild
cattle
can
always
escape
despite
their
strength
and
they
have
been
known
to
run
down
stags
though
not
their
usual
quarry
the
next
kind
of
wild
is
the
yellow
a
smaller
animal
with
smooth
hair
inclining
to
a
yellow
colour
which
lives
principally
upon
game
chasing
all
from
the
hare
to
the
stag
it
is
as
swift
or
nearly
as
swift
as
the
greyhound
and
possesses
greater
endurance
in
coursing
the
hare
it
not
uncommonly
happens
that
these
dogs
start
from
the
brake
and
take
the
hare
when
nearly
exhausted
from
the
hunter
hounds
they
will
in
the
same
way
follow
a
stag
which
has
been
almost
run
down
by
the
hunters
and
bring
him
to
bay
though
in
this
case
they
lose
their
booty
dispersing
through
fear
of
man
when
the
hunters
come
up
in
a
body
but
such
is
their
love
of
the
chase
that
they
are
known
to
assemble
from
their
lairs
at
the
distant
sound
of
the
horn
and
as
the
hunters
ride
through
the
woods
they
often
see
the
yellow
dogs
flitting
along
side
by
side
with
them
through
bush
and
fern
these
animals
sometimes
hunt
singly
sometimes
in
couples
and
as
the
season
advances
and
winter
approaches
in
packs
of
eight
or
twelve
they
never
attack
sheep
or
cattle
and
avoid
man
except
when
they
perceive
he
is
engaged
in
the
chase
there
is
little
doubt
that
they
are
the
descendants
of
the
dogs
which
the
ancients
called
lurchers
crossed
perhaps
with
the
greyhound
and
possibly
other
breeds
when
the
various
species
of
dogs
were
thrown
on
their
own
resources
those
only
withstood
the
exposure
and
hardships
which
were
naturally
hardy
and
possessed
natural
aptitude
for
the
chase
the
third
species
of
is
the
white
they
are
low
on
the
legs
of
a
dingy
white
colour
and
much
smaller
than
the
other
two
they
neither
attack
cattle
nor
game
though
fond
of
hunting
rabbits
this
dog
is
in
fact
a
scavenger
living
upon
the
carcases
of
dead
sheep
and
animals
which
are
found
picked
clean
in
the
night
for
this
purpose
it
haunts
the
neighbourhood
of
habitations
and
prowls
in
the
evening
over
heaps
of
refuse
scampering
away
at
the
least
alarm
for
it
is
extremely
timid
it
is
perfectly
harmless
for
even
the
poultry
do
not
dread
it
and
it
will
not
face
a
tame
cat
if
by
chance
the
two
meet
it
is
rarely
met
with
far
from
habitations
though
it
will
accompany
an
army
on
the
march
it
may
be
said
to
remain
in
one
district
the
black
and
yellow
dogs
on
the
contrary
roam
about
the
forest
without
apparent
home
one
day
the
hunter
sees
signs
of
their
presence
and
perhaps
may
for
a
month
afterwards
not
so
much
as
hear
a
bark
this
uncertainty
in
the
case
of
the
black
dog
is
the
bane
of
the
shepherds
for
not
seeing
or
hearing
anything
of
the
enemy
for
months
altogether
in
spite
of
former
experience
their
vigilance
relaxes
and
suddenly
while
they
sleep
their
flocks
are
scattered
we
still
have
among
tame
dogs
the
mastiff
terrier
spaniel
deerhound
and
greyhound
all
of
which
are
as
faithful
to
man
as
ever
chapter
ii
wild
animals
when
the
ancients
departed
great
numbers
of
their
cattle
perished
it
was
not
so
much
the
want
of
food
as
the
inability
to
endure
exposure
that
caused
their
death
a
few
winters
are
related
to
have
so
reduced
them
that
they
died
by
hundreds
many
mangled
by
dogs
the
hardiest
that
remained
became
perfectly
wild
and
the
wood
cattle
are
now
more
difficult
to
approach
than
deer
there
are
two
kinds
the
white
and
the
black
the
white
sometimes
dun
are
believed
to
be
the
survivors
of
the
domestic
for
the
cattle
in
our
enclosures
at
the
present
day
are
of
that
colour
the
black
are
smaller
and
are
doubtless
little
changed
from
their
state
in
the
olden
times
except
that
they
are
wild
these
latter
are
timid
unless
accompanied
by
a
calf
and
are
rarely
known
to
turn
upon
their
pursuers
but
the
white
are
fierce
at
all
times
they
will
not
indeed
attack
man
but
will
scarcely
run
from
him
and
it
is
not
always
safe
to
cross
their
haunts
the
bulls
are
savage
beyond
measure
at
certain
seasons
of
the
year
if
they
see
men
at
a
distance
they
retire
if
they
come
unexpectedly
face
to
face
they
attack
this
characteristic
enables
those
who
travel
through
districts
known
to
be
haunted
by
white
cattle
to
provide
against
an
encounter
for
by
occasionally
blowing
a
horn
the
herd
that
may
be
in
the
vicinity
is
dispersed
there
are
not
often
more
than
twenty
in
a
herd
the
hides
of
the
dun
are
highly
prized
both
for
their
intrinsic
value
and
as
proofs
of
skill
and
courage
so
much
so
that
you
shall
hardly
buy
a
skin
for
all
the
money
you
may
offer
and
the
horns
are
likewise
trophies
the
white
or
dun
bull
is
the
monarch
of
our
forests
four
kinds
of
wild
pigs
are
found
the
most
numerous
or
at
least
the
most
often
seen
as
it
lies
about
our
enclosures
is
the
common
it
is
the
largest
of
the
wild
pigs
and
in
colour
much
the
hue
of
the
mud
in
which
it
wallows
to
the
agriculturist
it
is
the
greatest
pest
destroying
or
damaging
all
kinds
of
crops
and
routing
up
the
gardens
it
is
with
difficulty
kept
out
by
palisading
for
if
there
be
a
weak
place
in
the
wooden
framework
the
strong
snout
of
the
animal
is
sure
to
undermine
and
work
a
passage
through
as
there
are
always
so
many
of
these
pigs
round
about
inhabited
places
and
cultivated
fields
constant
care
is
required
for
they
instantly
discover
an
opening
from
their
habit
of
haunting
the
thickets
and
bush
which
come
up
to
the
verge
of
the
enclosures
they
have
obtained
the
name
of
some
reach
an
immense
size
and
they
are
very
prolific
so
that
it
is
impossible
to
destroy
them
the
boars
are
fierce
at
a
particular
season
but
never
attack
unless
provoked
to
do
so
but
when
driven
to
bay
they
are
the
most
dangerous
of
the
boars
on
account
of
their
vast
size
and
weight
they
are
of
a
sluggish
disposition
and
will
not
rise
from
their
lairs
unless
forced
to
do
so
the
next
kind
is
the
white
hog
which
has
much
the
same
habits
as
the
former
except
that
it
is
usually
found
in
moist
places
near
lakes
and
rivers
and
is
often
called
the
the
third
kind
is
perfectly
black
much
smaller
in
size
and
very
active
affording
by
far
the
best
sport
and
also
the
best
food
when
killed
as
they
are
found
on
the
hills
where
the
ground
is
somewhat
more
open
horses
can
follow
freely
and
the
chase
becomes
exciting
by
some
it
is
called
the
from
the
locality
it
frequents
the
small
tusks
of
the
black
boar
are
used
for
many
ornamental
purposes
these
three
species
are
considered
to
be
the
descendants
of
the
various
domestic
pigs
of
the
ancients
but
the
fourth
or
grey
is
thought
to
be
the
true
wild
boar
it
is
seldom
seen
but
is
most
common
in
the
forests
where
from
the
quantity
of
fern
it
is
called
the
this
kind
is
believed
to
represent
the
true
wild
boar
which
was
extinct
or
merged
in
the
domestic
hog
among
the
ancients
except
in
that
neighbourhood
where
the
strain
remained
with
wild
times
the
wild
habits
have
returned
and
the
grey
boar
is
at
once
the
most
difficult
of
access
and
the
most
ready
to
encounter
either
dogs
or
men
although
the
first
or
does
the
most
damage
to
the
agriculturist
because
of
its
numbers
and
its
habit
of
haunting
the
neighbourhood
of
enclosures
the
others
are
equally
injurious
if
they
chance
to
enter
the
cultivated
fields
the
three
principal
kinds
of
wild
sheep
are
the
horned
the
thyme
and
the
meadow
the
thyme
sheep
are
the
smallest
and
haunt
the
highest
hills
in
the
south
where
feeding
on
the
sweet
herbage
of
the
ridges
their
flesh
is
said
to
acquire
a
flavour
of
wild
thyme
they
move
in
small
flocks
of
not
more
than
thirty
and
are
the
most
difficult
to
approach
being
far
more
wary
than
deer
so
continuously
are
they
hunted
by
the
the
horned
are
larger
and
move
in
greater
numbers
as
many
as
two
hundred
are
sometimes
seen
together
they
are
found
on
the
lower
slopes
and
plains
and
in
the
woods
the
meadow
sheep
have
long
shaggy
wool
which
is
made
into
various
articles
of
clothing
but
they
are
not
numerous
they
haunt
river
sides
and
the
shores
of
lakes
and
ponds
none
of
these
are
easily
got
at
on
account
of
the
but
the
rams
of
the
horned
kind
are
reputed
to
sometimes
turn
upon
the
pursuing
pack
and
butt
them
to
death
in
the
extremity
of
their
terror
whole
flocks
of
wild
sheep
have
been
driven
over
precipices
and
into
quagmires
and
torrents
besides
these
there
are
several
other
species
whose
haunt
is
local
on
the
islands
especially
different
kinds
are
found
the
will
occasionally
in
calm
weather
swim
out
to
an
island
and
kill
every
sheep
upon
it
from
the
horses
that
were
in
use
among
the
ancients
the
two
wild
species
now
found
are
known
to
have
descended
a
fact
confirmed
by
their
evident
resemblance
to
the
horses
we
still
retain
the
largest
wild
horse
is
almost
black
or
inclined
to
a
dark
colour
somewhat
less
in
size
than
our
present
waggon
horses
but
of
the
same
heavy
make
it
is
however
much
swifter
on
account
of
having
enjoyed
liberty
for
so
long
it
is
called
the
being
generally
distributed
among
thickets
and
lands
adjoining
water
the
other
species
is
called
the
from
its
habitat
the
hills
and
is
rather
less
in
size
than
our
this
latter
is
short
and
so
much
so
as
not
to
be
easily
ridden
by
short
persons
without
high
stirrups
neither
of
these
wild
horses
are
numerous
but
neither
are
they
uncommon
they
keep
entirely
separate
from
each
other
as
many
as
thirty
mares
are
sometimes
seen
together
but
there
are
districts
where
the
traveller
will
not
observe
one
for
weeks
tradition
says
that
in
the
olden
times
there
were
horses
of
a
slender
build
whose
speed
outstripped
the
wind
but
of
the
breed
of
these
famous
racers
not
one
is
left
whether
they
were
too
delicate
to
withstand
exposure
or
whether
the
wild
dogs
hunted
them
down
is
uncertain
but
they
are
quite
gone
did
but
one
exist
how
eagerly
it
would
be
sought
out
for
in
these
days
it
would
be
worth
its
weight
in
gold
unless
indeed
as
some
affirm
such
speed
only
endured
for
a
mile
or
two
it
is
not
necessary
having
written
thus
far
of
the
animals
that
anything
be
said
of
the
birds
of
the
woods
which
every
one
knows
were
not
always
wild
and
which
can
indeed
be
compared
with
such
poultry
as
are
kept
in
our
enclosures
such
are
the
the
the
galenæ
the
peacocks
the
white
duck
and
the
white
goose
all
of
which
though
now
wild
as
the
hawk
are
well
known
to
have
been
once
tame
there
were
deer
red
and
fallow
in
numerous
parks
and
chases
of
very
old
time
and
these
having
got
loose
and
having
such
immense
tracts
to
roam
over
unmolested
went
on
increasing
till
now
they
are
beyond
computation
and
i
have
myself
seen
a
thousand
head
together
within
these
forty
years
as
i
learn
the
too
have
come
down
from
the
extreme
north
so
that
there
are
now
three
sorts
in
the
woods
before
them
the
came
from
the
same
direction
and
though
they
are
not
yet
common
it
is
believed
they
are
increasing
for
the
first
few
years
after
the
change
took
place
there
seemed
a
danger
lest
the
foreign
wild
beasts
that
had
been
confined
as
curiosities
in
menageries
should
multiply
and
remain
in
the
woods
but
this
did
not
happen
some
few
lions
tigers
bears
and
other
animals
did
indeed
escape
together
with
many
less
furious
creatures
and
it
is
related
that
they
roamed
about
the
fields
for
a
long
time
they
were
seldom
met
with
having
such
an
extent
of
country
to
wander
over
and
after
a
while
entirely
disappeared
if
any
progeny
were
born
the
winter
frosts
must
have
destroyed
it
and
the
same
fate
awaited
the
monstrous
serpents
which
had
been
collected
for
exhibition
only
one
such
animal
now
exists
which
is
known
to
owe
its
origin
to
those
which
escaped
from
the
dens
of
the
ancients
it
is
the
beaver
whose
dams
are
now
occasionally
found
upon
the
streams
by
those
who
traverse
the
woods
some
of
the
aquatic
birds
too
which
frequent
the
lakes
are
thought
to
have
been
originally
derived
from
those
which
were
formerly
kept
as
curiosities
in
the
castle
yard
at
longtover
may
still
be
seen
the
bones
of
an
elephant
which
was
found
dying
in
the
woods
near
that
spot
chapter
iii
men
of
the
woods
so
far
as
this
all
that
i
have
stated
has
been
clear
and
there
can
be
no
doubt
that
what
has
been
thus
handed
down
from
mouth
to
mouth
is
for
the
most
part
correct
when
i
pass
from
trees
and
animals
to
men
however
the
thing
is
different
for
nothing
is
certain
and
everything
confused
none
of
the
accounts
agree
nor
can
they
be
altogether
reconciled
with
present
facts
or
with
reasonable
supposition
yet
it
is
not
so
long
since
but
a
few
memories
added
one
to
the
other
can
bridge
the
time
and
though
not
many
there
are
some
written
notes
still
to
be
found
i
must
attribute
the
discrepancy
to
the
wars
and
hatreds
which
sprang
up
and
divided
the
people
so
that
one
would
not
listen
to
what
the
others
wished
to
say
and
the
truth
was
lost
besides
which
in
the
conflagration
which
consumed
the
towns
most
of
the
records
were
destroyed
and
are
no
longer
to
be
referred
to
and
it
may
be
that
even
when
they
were
proceeding
the
causes
of
the
change
were
not
understood
therefore
what
i
am
now
about
to
describe
is
not
to
be
regarded
as
the
ultimate
truth
but
as
the
nearest
to
which
i
could
attain
after
comparing
the
various
traditions
some
say
then
that
the
first
beginning
of
the
change
was
because
the
sea
silted
up
the
entrances
to
the
ancient
ports
and
stopped
the
vast
commerce
which
was
once
carried
on
it
is
certainly
true
that
many
of
the
ports
are
silted
up
and
are
now
useless
as
such
but
whether
the
silting
up
preceded
the
disappearance
of
the
population
or
whether
the
disappearance
of
the
population
and
the
consequent
neglect
caused
the
silting
i
can
not
venture
to
positively
assert
for
there
are
signs
that
the
level
of
the
sea
has
sunk
in
some
places
and
signs
that
it
has
become
higher
in
others
so
that
the
judicious
historian
will
simply
state
the
facts
and
refrain
from
colouring
them
with
his
own
theory
as
silvester
has
done
others
again
maintain
that
the
supply
of
food
from
over
the
ocean
suddenly
stopping
caused
great
disorders
and
that
the
people
crowded
on
board
all
the
ships
to
escape
starvation
and
sailed
away
and
were
no
more
heard
of
it
has
too
been
said
that
the
earth
from
some
attractive
power
exercised
by
the
passage
of
an
enormous
dark
body
through
space
became
tilted
or
inclined
to
its
orbit
more
than
before
and
that
this
while
it
lasted
altered
the
flow
of
the
magnetic
currents
which
in
an
imperceptible
manner
influence
the
minds
of
men
hitherto
the
stream
of
human
life
had
directed
itself
to
the
westward
but
when
this
reversal
of
magnetism
occurred
a
general
desire
arose
to
return
to
the
east
and
those
whose
business
is
theology
have
pointed
out
that
the
wickedness
of
those
times
surpassed
understanding
and
that
a
change
and
sweeping
away
of
the
human
evil
that
had
accumulated
was
necessary
and
was
effected
by
supernatural
means
the
relation
of
this
must
be
left
to
them
since
it
is
not
the
province
of
the
philosopher
to
meddle
with
such
matters
all
that
seems
certain
is
that
when
the
event
took
place
the
immense
crowds
collected
in
cities
were
most
affected
and
that
the
richer
and
upper
classes
made
use
of
their
money
to
escape
those
left
behind
were
mainly
the
lower
and
most
ignorant
so
far
as
the
arts
were
concerned
those
that
dwelt
in
distant
and
outlying
places
and
those
who
lived
by
agriculture
these
last
at
that
date
had
fallen
to
such
distress
that
they
could
not
hire
vessels
to
transport
themselves
the
exact
number
of
those
left
behind
can
not
of
course
be
told
but
it
is
on
record
that
when
the
fields
were
first
neglected
as
i
have
already
described
a
man
might
ride
a
hundred
miles
and
not
meet
another
they
were
not
only
few
but
scattered
and
had
not
drawn
together
and
formed
towns
as
at
present
of
what
became
of
the
vast
multitudes
that
left
the
country
nothing
has
ever
been
heard
and
no
communication
has
been
received
from
them
for
this
reason
i
can
not
conceal
my
opinion
that
they
must
have
sailed
either
to
the
westward
or
to
the
southward
where
the
greatest
extent
of
ocean
is
understood
to
exist
and
not
to
the
eastward
as
silvester
would
have
it
in
his
work
upon
the
unknown
orb
the
dark
body
travelling
in
space
to
which
i
have
alluded
none
of
our
vessels
in
the
present
day
dare
venture
into
those
immense
tracts
of
sea
nor
indeed
out
of
sight
of
land
unless
they
know
they
shall
see
it
again
so
soon
as
they
have
reached
and
surmounted
the
ridge
of
the
horizon
had
they
only
crossed
to
the
mainland
or
continent
again
we
should
most
likely
have
heard
of
their
passage
across
the
countries
there
it
is
true
that
ships
rarely
come
over
and
only
to
two
ports
and
that
the
men
on
them
say
so
far
as
can
be
understood
that
their
country
is
equally
deserted
now
and
has
likewise
lost
its
population
but
still
as
men
talk
unto
men
and
we
pass
intelligence
across
great
breadths
of
land
it
is
almost
certain
that
had
they
travelled
that
way
some
echo
of
their
footsteps
would
yet
sound
back
to
us
regarding
this
theory
therefore
as
untenable
i
put
forward
as
a
suggestion
that
the
ancients
really
sailed
to
the
west
or
to
the
south
as
for
the
most
part
those
who
were
left
behind
were
ignorant
rude
and
unlettered
it
consequently
happened
that
many
of
the
marvellous
things
which
the
ancients
did
and
the
secrets
of
their
science
are
known
to
us
by
name
only
and
indeed
hardly
by
name
it
has
happened
to
us
in
our
turn
as
it
happened
to
the
ancients
for
they
were
aware
that
in
times
before
their
own
the
art
of
making
glass
malleable
had
been
discovered
so
that
it
could
be
beaten
into
shape
like
copper
but
the
manner
in
which
it
was
accomplished
was
entirely
unknown
to
them
the
fact
was
on
record
but
the
cause
lost
so
now
we
know
that
those
who
to
us
are
the
ancients
had
a
way
of
making
diamonds
and
precious
stones
out
of
black
and
lustreless
charcoal
a
fact
which
approaches
the
incredible
still
we
do
not
doubt
it
though
we
can
not
imagine
by
what
means
it
was
carried
out
they
also
sent
intelligence
to
the
utmost
parts
of
the
earth
along
wires
which
were
not
tubular
but
solid
and
therefore
could
not
transmit
sound
and
yet
the
person
who
received
the
message
could
hear
and
recognise
the
voice
of
the
sender
a
thousand
miles
away
with
certain
machines
worked
by
fire
they
traversed
the
land
swift
as
the
swallow
glides
through
the
sky
but
of
these
things
not
a
relic
remains
to
us
what
or
wheels
or
bars
of
iron
were
left
and
might
have
given
us
a
clue
were
all
broken
up
and
melted
down
for
use
in
other
ways
when
metal
became
scarce
mounds
of
earth
are
said
to
still
exist
in
the
woods
which
originally
formed
the
roads
for
these
machines
but
they
are
now
so
low
and
so
covered
with
thickets
that
nothing
can
be
learnt
from
them
and
indeed
though
i
have
heard
of
their
existence
i
have
never
seen
one
great
holes
were
made
through
the
very
hills
for
the
passage
of
the
iron
chariot
but
they
are
now
blocked
by
the
falling
roofs
nor
dare
any
one
explore
such
parts
as
may
yet
be
open
where
are
the
wonderful
structures
with
which
the
men
of
those
days
were
lifted
to
the
skies
rising
above
the
clouds
these
marvellous
things
are
to
us
little
more
than
fables
of
the
giants
and
of
the
old
gods
that
walked
upon
the
earth
which
were
fables
even
to
those
whom
we
call
the
ancients
indeed
we
have
fuller
knowledge
of
those
extremely
ancient
times
than
of
the
people
who
immediately
preceded
us
and
the
romans
and
the
greeks
are
more
familiar
to
us
than
the
men
who
rode
in
the
iron
chariots
and
mounted
to
the
skies
the
reason
why
so
many
arts
and
sciences
were
lost
was
because
as
i
have
previously
said
the
most
of
those
who
were
left
in
the
country
were
ignorant
rude
and
unlettered
they
had
seen
the
iron
chariots
but
did
not
understand
the
method
of
their
construction
and
could
not
hand
down
the
knowledge
they
did
not
themselves
possess
the
magic
wires
of
intelligence
passed
through
their
villages
but
they
did
not
know
how
to
work
them
the
cunning
artificers
of
the
cities
all
departed
and
everything
fell
quickly
into
barbarism
nor
could
it
be
wondered
at
for
the
few
and
scattered
people
of
those
days
had
enough
to
do
to
preserve
their
lives
communication
between
one
place
and
another
was
absolutely
cut
off
and
if
one
perchance
did
recollect
something
that
might
have
been
of
use
he
could
not
confer
with
another
who
knew
the
other
part
and
thus
between
them
reconstruct
the
machine
in
the
second
generation
even
these
disjointed
memories
died
out
at
first
it
is
supposed
that
those
who
remained
behind
existed
upon
the
grain
in
the
warehouses
and
what
they
could
thresh
by
the
flail
from
the
crops
left
neglected
in
the
fields
but
as
the
provisions
in
the
warehouses
were
consumed
or
spoiled
they
hunted
the
animals
lately
tame
and
as
yet
but
half
wild
as
these
grew
less
in
number
and
difficult
to
overtake
they
set
to
work
again
to
till
the
ground
and
cleared
away
small
portions
of
the
earth
encumbered
already
with
brambles
and
thistles
some
grew
corn
and
some
took
charge
of
sheep
thus
in
time
places
far
apart
from
each
other
were
settled
and
towns
were
built
towns
indeed
we
call
them
to
distinguish
them
from
the
champaign
but
they
are
not
worthy
of
the
name
in
comparison
with
the
mighty
cities
of
old
time
there
are
many
that
have
not
more
than
fifty
houses
in
the
enclosure
and
perhaps
no
other
station
within
a
day
journey
and
the
largest
are
but
villages
reckoning
by
antiquity
for
the
most
part
they
have
their
own
government
or
had
till
recently
and
thus
there
grew
up
many
provinces
and
kingdoms
in
the
compass
of
what
was
originally
but
one
thus
separated
and
divided
there
came
also
to
be
many
races
where
in
the
first
place
was
one
people
now
in
briefly
recounting
the
principal
divisions
of
men
i
will
commence
with
those
who
are
everywhere
considered
the
lowest
these
are
the
bushmen
who
live
wholly
in
the
woods
even
among
the
ancients
when
every
man
woman
and
child
could
exercise
those
arts
which
are
now
the
special
mark
of
nobility
reading
and
writing
there
was
a
degraded
class
of
persons
who
refused
to
avail
themselves
of
the
benefits
of
civilization
they
obtained
their
food
by
begging
wandering
along
the
highways
crouching
around
fires
which
they
lit
in
the
open
clad
in
rags
and
exhibiting
countenances
from
which
every
trace
of
had
disappeared
these
were
the
ancestors
of
the
present
men
of
the
bushes
they
took
naturally
to
the
neglected
fields
and
forming
camps
as
they
call
their
tribes
or
rather
families
wandered
to
and
fro
easily
subsisting
upon
roots
and
trapped
game
so
they
live
to
this
day
having
become
extremely
dexterous
in
snaring
every
species
of
bird
and
animal
and
the
fishes
of
the
streams
these
latter
they
sometimes
poison
with
a
drug
or
a
plant
it
is
not
known
which
the
knowledge
of
which
has
been
preserved
among
them
since
the
days
of
the
ancients
the
poison
kills
the
fishes
and
brings
them
to
the
surface
when
they
can
be
collected
by
hundreds
but
does
not
injure
them
for
eating
like
the
black
the
bushmen
often
in
fits
of
savage
frenzy
destroy
thrice
as
much
as
they
can
devour
trapping
deer
in
wickerwork
hedges
or
pitfalls
and
cutting
the
miserable
animals
in
pieces
for
mere
thirst
of
blood
the
oxen
and
cattle
in
the
enclosures
are
occasionally
in
the
same
manner
fearfully
mutilated
by
these
wretches
sometimes
for
amusement
and
sometimes
in
vengeance
for
injuries
done
to
them
bushmen
have
no
settled
home
cultivate
no
kind
of
corn
or
vegetable
keep
no
animals
not
even
dogs
have
no
houses
or
huts
no
boats
or
canoes
nothing
that
requires
the
least
intelligence
or
energy
to
construct
roaming
to
and
fro
without
any
apparent
aim
or
object
or
any
particular
route
they
fix
their
camp
for
a
few
days
wherever
it
suits
their
fancy
and
again
move
on
no
man
knows
why
or
whither
it
is
this
uncertainty
of
movement
which
makes
them
so
dangerous
there
may
not
be
the
least
sign
of
any
within
miles
of
an
enclosure
in
the
night
a
camp
may
pass
slaughtering
such
cattle
as
may
have
remained
without
the
palisade
or
killing
the
unfortunate
shepherd
who
has
not
got
within
the
walls
and
in
the
morning
they
may
be
nowhere
to
be
seen
having
disappeared
like
vermin
face
to
face
the
bushman
is
never
to
be
feared
a
whole
camp
or
tribal
family
will
scatter
if
a
traveler
stumbles
into
their
midst
it
is
from
behind
a
tree
or
under
cover
of
night
that
he
deals
his
murderous
blow
a
camp
may
consist
of
ten
or
twenty
individuals
sometimes
perhaps
of
forty
or
even
fifty
of
various
ages
and
is
ruled
by
the
eldest
who
is
also
the
parent
he
is
absolute
master
of
his
camp
but
has
no
power
or
recognition
beyond
it
so
that
how
many
leaders
there
may
be
among
them
it
is
not
possible
even
to
guess
nor
is
the
master
known
to
them
as
king
or
duke
nor
has
he
any
title
but
is
simply
the
oldest
or
founder
of
the
family
the
camp
has
no
law
no
established
custom
events
happen
and
even
the
master
can
not
be
said
to
reign
when
he
becomes
feeble
they
simply
leave
him
to
die
they
are
depraved
and
without
shame
clad
in
chiefly
if
clad
at
all
or
in
such
clothes
as
they
have
stolen
they
have
no
ceremonies
whatever
the
number
of
these
camps
must
be
considerable
and
yet
the
bushman
is
seldom
seen
nor
do
we
very
often
hear
of
their
depredations
which
is
accounted
for
by
the
extent
of
country
they
wander
over
it
is
in
severe
winters
that
the
chief
danger
occurs
they
then
suffer
from
hunger
and
cold
and
are
driven
to
the
neighbourhood
of
the
enclosures
to
steal
so
dexterous
are
they
in
slipping
through
the
bushes
and
slinking
among
the
reeds
and
osiers
that
they
will
pass
within
a
few
yards
without
discovering
their
presence
and
the
signs
of
their
passage
can
be
detected
only
by
the
experienced
hunter
and
not
always
by
him
it
is
observed
that
whatever
mischief
the
bushman
commits
he
never
sets
fire
to
any
ricks
or
buildings
the
reason
is
because
his
nature
is
to
slink
from
the
scene
of
his
depredations
and
flame
at
once
attracts
people
to
the
spot
twice
the
occurrence
of
a
remarkably
severe
winter
has
caused
the
bushmen
to
flock
together
and
act
in
an
approach
to
concert
in
attacking
the
enclosures
the
bushmen
of
the
north
who
were
even
more
savage
and
brutal
then
came
down
and
were
with
difficulty
repulsed
from
the
walled
cities
in
ordinary
times
we
see
very
little
of
them
they
are
the
thieves
the
human
vermin
of
the
woods
under
the
name
of
gipsies
those
who
are
now
often
called
romany
and
zingari
were
well
known
to
the
ancients
indeed
they
boast
that
their
ancestry
goes
back
so
much
farther
than
the
oldest
we
can
claim
that
the
ancients
themselves
were
but
modern
to
them
even
in
that
age
of
highest
civilization
which
immediately
preceded
the
present
they
say
and
there
is
no
doubt
of
it
that
they
preserved
the
blood
of
their
race
pure
and
untainted
that
they
never
dwelt
under
permanent
roofs
nor
bowed
their
knees
to
the
prevalent
religion
they
remained
apart
and
still
continue
after
civilization
has
disappeared
exactly
the
same
as
they
were
before
it
commenced
since
the
change
their
numbers
have
greatly
increased
and
were
they
not
always
at
war
with
each
other
it
is
possible
that
they
might
go
far
to
sweep
the
house
people
from
the
land
but
there
are
so
many
tribes
each
with
its
king
queen
or
duke
that
their
power
is
divided
and
their
force
melts
away
the
ruler
of
the
bushman
families
is
always
a
man
but
among
the
gipsies
a
woman
and
even
a
young
girl
often
exercises
supreme
authority
but
must
be
of
the
sacred
blood
these
kings
and
dukes
are
absolute
autocrats
within
their
tribe
and
can
order
by
a
nod
the
destruction
of
those
who
offend
them
habits
of
simplest
obedience
being
enjoined
on
the
tribe
from
earliest
childhood
such
executions
are
rare
but
the
right
to
command
them
is
not
for
a
moment
questioned
of
the
sorcerers
and
particularly
the
sorceresses
among
them
all
have
heard
and
indeed
the
places
where
they
dwell
seem
full
of
mystery
and
magic
they
live
in
tents
and
though
they
constantly
remove
from
district
to
district
one
tribe
never
clashes
with
or
crosses
another
because
all
have
their
especial
routes
upon
which
no
intrusion
is
ever
made
some
agriculture
is
practiced
and
flocks
and
herds
are
kept
but
the
work
is
entirely
done
by
the
women
the
men
are
always
on
horseback
or
sleeping
in
their
tents
each
tribe
has
its
central
to
which
they
return
at
intervals
after
perhaps
wandering
for
months
a
certain
number
of
persons
being
left
at
home
to
defend
it
these
camps
are
often
situated
in
inaccessible
positions
and
well
protected
by
stockades
the
territory
which
is
acknowledged
to
belong
to
such
a
camp
is
extremely
limited
its
mere
environs
only
are
considered
the
actual
property
of
the
tribe
and
a
second
can
pitch
its
tents
with
a
few
hundred
yards
these
stockades
in
fact
are
more
like
than
residences
each
is
a
mere
rendezvous
the
gipsies
are
everywhere
but
their
stockades
are
most
numerous
in
the
south
along
the
sides
of
the
green
hills
and
plains
and
especially
round
stonehenge
where
on
the
great
open
plains
among
the
huge
boulders
placed
ages
since
in
circles
they
perform
strange
ceremonies
and
incantations
they
attack
every
traveller
and
every
caravan
or
train
of
waggons
which
they
feel
strong
enough
to
master
but
they
do
not
murder
the
solitary
sleeping
hunter
or
shepherd
like
the
bushmen
they
will
indeed
steal
from
him
but
do
not
kill
except
in
fight
once
now
and
then
they
have
found
their
way
into
towns
when
terrible
massacres
have
followed
for
when
excited
the
savage
knows
not
how
to
restrain
himself
vengeance
is
their
idol
if
any
community
has
injured
or
affronted
them
they
never
cease
endeavouring
to
retaliate
and
will
wipe
it
out
in
fire
and
blood
generations
afterwards
there
are
towns
which
have
thus
been
suddenly
harried
when
the
citizens
had
forgotten
that
any
cause
of
enmity
existed
vengeance
is
their
religion
and
their
social
law
which
guides
all
their
actions
among
themselves
it
is
for
this
reason
that
they
are
continually
at
war
duke
with
duke
and
king
with
king
a
deadly
feud
too
has
set
bushman
and
gipsy
at
each
other
throat
far
beyond
the
memory
of
man
the
romany
looks
on
the
bushman
as
a
dog
and
slaughters
him
as
such
in
turn
the
despised
human
dog
slinks
in
the
darkness
of
the
night
into
the
romany
tent
and
stabs
his
daughter
or
his
wife
for
such
is
the
meanness
and
cowardice
of
the
bushman
that
he
would
always
rather
kill
a
woman
than
a
man
there
is
also
a
third
class
of
men
who
are
not
true
gipsies
but
have
something
of
their
character
though
the
gipsies
will
not
allow
that
they
were
originally
their
habits
are
much
the
same
except
that
they
are
foot
men
and
rarely
use
horses
and
are
therefore
called
the
foot
gipsies
the
gipsy
horse
is
really
a
pony
once
only
have
the
romany
combined
to
attack
the
house
people
driven
like
the
bushmen
by
an
exceedingly
severe
winter
against
which
they
had
no
provision
but
then
instead
of
massing
their
forces
and
throwing
their
irresistible
numbers
upon
one
city
or
territory
all
they
would
agree
to
do
was
that
upon
a
certain
day
each
tribe
should
invade
the
land
nearest
to
it
the
result
was
that
they
were
though
with
trouble
repulsed
until
lately
no
leader
ventured
to
follow
the
gipsies
to
their
strongholds
for
they
were
reputed
invincible
behind
their
stockades
by
infesting
the
woods
and
lying
in
ambush
they
rendered
communication
between
city
and
city
difficult
and
dangerous
except
to
bodies
of
armed
men
and
every
waggon
had
to
be
defended
by
troops
the
gipsies
as
they
roam
make
little
secret
of
their
presence
unless
of
course
intent
upon
mischief
but
light
their
fires
by
day
and
night
fearlessly
the
bushmen
never
light
a
fire
by
day
lest
the
ascending
smoke
which
can
not
be
concealed
should
betray
their
whereabouts
their
fires
are
lit
at
night
in
hollows
or
places
well
surrounded
with
thickets
and
that
the
flame
may
not
be
seen
they
will
build
screens
of
fir
boughs
or
fern
when
they
have
obtained
a
good
supply
of
hot
wood
coals
no
more
sticks
are
thrown
on
but
these
are
covered
with
turf
and
thus
kept
in
long
enough
for
their
purposes
much
of
their
meat
they
devour
raw
and
thus
do
not
need
a
fire
so
frequently
as
others
chapter
iv
the
invaders
those
who
live
by
agriculture
or
in
towns
and
are
descended
from
the
remnant
of
the
ancients
are
divided
as
i
have
previously
said
into
numerous
provinces
kingdoms
and
republics
in
the
middle
part
of
the
country
the
cities
are
almost
all
upon
the
shores
of
the
lake
or
within
a
short
distance
of
the
water
and
there
is
therefore
more
traffic
and
communication
between
them
by
means
of
vessels
than
is
the
case
with
inland
towns
whose
trade
must
be
carried
on
by
caravans
and
waggons
these
not
only
move
slowly
but
are
subject
to
be
interrupted
by
the
romany
and
by
the
banditti
or
persons
who
for
moral
or
political
crimes
have
been
banished
from
their
homes
it
is
in
the
cities
that
cluster
around
the
great
central
lake
that
all
the
life
and
civilization
of
our
day
are
found
but
there
also
begin
those
wars
and
social
convulsions
which
cause
so
much
suffering
when
was
the
peninsula
at
peace
and
when
was
there
not
some
mischief
and
change
brewing
in
the
republics
when
was
there
not
a
danger
from
the
northern
mainland
until
recent
years
there
was
little
knowledge
of
and
scarcely
any
direct
commerce
or
intercourse
between
the
central
part
and
the
districts
either
of
the
extreme
west
or
the
north
and
it
is
only
now
that
the
north
and
east
are
becoming
open
to
us
for
at
the
back
of
the
narrow
circle
or
cultivated
land
the
belt
about
the
lake
there
extend
immense
forests
in
every
direction
through
which
till
very
lately
no
practicable
way
had
been
cut
even
in
the
more
civilized
central
part
it
is
not
to
this
day
easy
to
travel
for
at
the
barriers
as
you
approach
the
territories
of
every
prince
they
demand
your
business
and
your
papers
nor
even
if
you
establish
the
fact
that
you
are
innocent
of
designs
against
the
state
shall
you
hardly
enter
without
satisfying
the
greed
of
the
officials
a
fine
is
thus
exacted
at
the
gate
of
every
province
and
kingdom
and
again
at
the
gateways
of
the
towns
the
difference
of
the
coinage
such
as
it
is
causes
also
great
loss
and
trouble
for
the
money
of
one
kingdom
though
passing
current
by
command
in
that
territory
is
not
received
at
its
nominal
value
in
the
next
on
account
of
the
alloy
it
contains
it
is
indeed
in
many
kingdoms
impossible
to
obtain
sterling
money
gold
there
is
little
or
none
anywhere
but
silver
is
the
standard
of
exchange
and
copper
bronze
and
brass
sometimes
tin
are
the
metals
with
which
the
greater
number
of
the
people
transact
their
business
justice
is
corrupt
for
where
there
is
a
king
or
a
prince
it
depends
on
the
caprice
of
a
tyrant
and
where
there
is
a
republic
upon
the
shout
of
the
crowd
so
that
many
if
they
think
they
may
be
put
on
trial
rather
than
face
the
risk
at
once
escape
into
the
woods
the
league
though
based
ostensibly
on
principles
the
most
exalted
and
beneficial
to
humanity
is
known
to
be
perverted
the
members
sworn
to
honour
and
the
highest
virtue
are
swayed
by
vile
motives
political
hatreds
and
private
passions
and
even
by
money
men
for
ever
trample
upon
men
each
pushing
to
the
front
nor
is
there
safety
in
remaining
in
retirement
since
such
are
accused
of
biding
their
time
and
of
occult
designs
though
the
population
of
these
cities
all
counted
together
is
not
equal
to
the
population
that
once
dwelt
in
a
single
city
of
the
ancients
yet
how
much
greater
are
the
bitterness
and
the
struggle
yet
not
content
with
the
bloodshed
they
themselves
cause
the
tyrants
have
called
in
the
aid
of
mercenary
soldiers
to
assist
them
and
to
complete
the
disgrace
those
republics
which
proclaim
themselves
the
very
home
of
patriotic
virtues
have
resorted
to
the
same
means
thus
we
see
english
cities
kept
in
awe
by
troops
of
welshmen
irish
and
even
the
western
scots
who
swarm
in
the
of
the
republics
and
opening
the
doors
of
the
houses
help
themselves
to
what
they
will
this
too
in
the
face
of
the
notorious
fact
that
these
nations
have
sworn
to
be
avenged
upon
us
that
their
vessels
sail
about
the
lake
committing
direful
acts
of
piracy
and
that
twice
already
vast
armies
have
swept
along
threatening
to
entirely
overwhelm
the
whole
commonwealth
what
infatuation
to
admit
bands
of
these
same
men
into
the
very
strongholds
and
the
heart
of
the
land
as
if
upon
the
approach
of
their
countrymen
they
would
remain
true
to
the
oaths
they
have
sworn
for
pay
and
not
rather
admit
them
with
open
arms
no
blame
can
upon
a
just
consideration
be
attributed
to
either
of
these
nations
that
endeavour
to
oppress
us
for
as
they
point
out
the
ancients
from
whom
we
are
descended
held
them
in
subjection
many
hundred
years
and
took
from
them
all
their
liberties
thus
the
welsh
or
as
they
call
themselves
the
cymry
say
that
the
whole
island
was
once
theirs
and
is
theirs
still
by
right
of
inheritance
they
were
the
original
people
who
possessed
it
ages
before
the
arrival
of
those
whom
we
call
the
ancients
though
they
were
driven
into
the
mountains
of
the
far
distant
west
they
never
forgot
their
language
ceased
their
customs
or
gave
up
their
aspirations
to
recover
their
own
this
is
now
their
aim
and
until
recently
it
seemed
as
if
they
were
about
to
accomplish
it
for
they
held
all
that
country
anciently
called
cornwall
having
crossed
over
the
severn
and
marched
down
the
southern
shore
the
rich
land
of
devon
part
of
dorset
all
indeed
that
is
inhabited
and
the
most
part
of
somerset
acknowledged
their
rule
worcester
and
hereford
and
gloucester
were
theirs
i
mean
of
course
those
parts
that
are
not
forest
their
outposts
were
pushed
forward
to
the
centre
of
leicestershire
and
came
down
towards
oxford
but
thereabouts
they
met
with
the
forces
of
which
i
will
shortly
speak
then
their
vessels
every
summer
sailing
from
the
severn
came
into
the
lake
and
landing
wherever
there
was
an
opportunity
they
destroyed
all
things
and
carried
off
the
spoil
is
it
necessary
to
say
more
to
demonstrate
the
madness
which
possesses
those
princes
and
republics
which
in
order
to
support
their
own
tyranny
have
invited
bands
of
these
men
into
their
very
palaces
and
forts
as
they
approached
near
what
was
once
oxford
and
is
now
sypolis
the
armies
of
the
cymry
came
into
collision
with
another
of
our
invaders
and
thus
their
forward
course
to
the
south
was
checked
the
irish
who
had
hitherto
abetted
them
turned
round
to
defend
their
own
usurpations
they
too
say
that
in
conquering
and
despoiling
my
countrymen
they
are
fulfilling
a
divine
vengeance
their
land
of
ireland
had
been
for
centuries
ground
down
with
an
iron
tyranny
by
our
ancestors
who
closed
their
lips
with
a
muzzle
and
led
them
about
with
a
bridle
as
their
poets
say
but
now
the
hateful
saxons
for
thus
both
they
and
the
welsh
designate
us
are
broken
and
delivered
over
to
them
for
their
spoil
it
is
not
possible
to
deny
many
of
the
statements
that
they
make
but
that
should
not
prevent
us
from
battling
with
might
and
main
against
the
threatened
subjection
what
crime
can
be
greater
than
the
admission
of
such
foreigners
as
the
guards
of
our
cities
now
the
irish
have
their
principal
rendezvous
and
capital
near
to
the
ancient
city
of
chester
which
is
upon
the
ocean
and
at
the
very
top
and
angle
of
wales
this
is
their
great
settlement
their
magazine
and
and
thence
their
expeditions
have
proceeded
it
is
a
convenient
port
and
well
opposite
their
native
land
from
which
reinforcements
continually
arrive
but
the
welsh
have
ever
looked
upon
their
possession
of
it
with
jealousy
at
the
period
when
the
cymry
had
nearly
penetrated
to
sypolis
or
oxford
the
irish
on
their
part
had
overrun
all
the
cultivated
and
inhabited
country
in
a
south
and
line
from
chester
through
rutland
to
norfolk
and
suffolk
and
even
as
far
as
luton
they
would
have
spread
to
the
north
but
in
that
direction
they
were
met
by
the
scots
who
had
all
northumbria
when
the
welsh
came
near
sypolis
the
irish
awoke
to
the
position
of
affairs
sypolis
is
the
largest
and
most
important
city
upon
the
northern
shore
of
the
lake
and
it
is
situated
at
the
entrance
to
the
neck
of
land
that
stretches
out
to
the
straits
if
the
welsh
were
once
well
posted
there
the
irish
could
never
hope
to
find
their
way
to
the
rich
and
cultivated
south
for
it
is
just
below
sypolis
that
the
lake
contracts
and
forms
a
strait
in
one
place
but
a
furlong
wide
the
two
forces
thus
came
into
collision
and
while
they
fought
and
destroyed
each
other
sypolis
was
saved
after
which
finding
they
were
evenly
matched
the
irish
withdrew
two
days
march
northwards
and
the
cymry
as
far
westwards
but
now
the
irish
sailing
round
the
outside
of
wales
came
likewise
up
through
the
red
rocks
and
so
into
the
lake
and
in
their
turn
landing
harassed
the
cities
often
welsh
and
irish
vessels
intending
to
attack
the
same
place
have
discerned
each
other
approaching
and
turning
from
their
proposed
action
have
flown
at
each
other
throats
the
scots
have
not
harassed
us
in
the
south
much
being
too
far
distant
and
those
that
wander
hither
come
for
pay
taking
service
as
guards
they
are
indeed
the
finest
of
men
and
the
hardiest
to
battle
with
i
had
forgotten
to
mention
that
it
is
possible
the
irish
might
have
pushed
back
the
welsh
had
not
the
kingdom
of
york
suddenly
reviving
by
means
which
shall
be
related
valiantly
thrust
out
its
masters
and
fell
upon
their
rear
but
still
these
nations
are
always
upon
the
verge
and
margin
of
our
world
and
wait
but
an
opportunity
to
rush
in
upon
it
our
countrymen
groan
under
their
yoke
and
i
say
again
that
infamy
should
be
the
portion
of
those
rulers
among
us
who
have
filled
their
fortified
places
with
mercenaries
derived
from
such
sources
the
land
too
is
weak
because
of
the
multitude
of
bondsmen
in
the
provinces
and
kingdoms
round
about
the
lake
there
is
hardly
a
town
where
the
slaves
do
not
outnumber
the
free
as
ten
to
one
the
laws
are
framed
for
the
object
of
reducing
the
greater
part
of
the
people
to
servitude
for
every
offence
the
punishment
is
slavery
and
the
offences
are
daily
artificially
increased
that
the
wealth
of
the
few
in
human
beings
may
grow
with
them
if
a
man
in
his
hunger
steal
a
loaf
he
becomes
a
slave
that
is
it
is
proclaimed
he
must
make
good
to
the
state
the
injury
he
has
done
it
and
must
work
out
his
trespass
this
is
not
assessed
as
the
value
of
the
loaf
nor
supposed
to
be
confined
to
the
individual
from
whom
it
was
taken
the
theft
is
said
to
damage
the
state
at
large
because
it
corrupts
the
morality
of
the
commonwealth
it
is
as
if
the
thief
had
stolen
a
loaf
not
from
one
but
from
every
member
of
the
state
restitution
must
therefore
be
made
to
all
and
the
value
of
the
loaf
returned
in
labour
a
thousandfold
the
thief
is
the
bondsman
of
the
state
but
as
the
state
can
not
employ
him
he
is
leased
out
to
those
who
will
pay
into
the
treasury
of
the
prince
the
money
equivalent
to
the
labour
he
is
capable
of
performing
thus
under
cover
of
the
highest
morality
the
greatest
iniquity
is
perpetrated
for
the
theft
of
a
loaf
the
man
is
reduced
to
a
slave
then
his
wife
and
children
unable
to
support
themselves
become
a
charge
to
the
state
that
is
they
beg
in
the
public
ways
this
too
forsooth
corrupts
morality
and
they
likewise
are
seized
and
leased
out
to
any
who
like
to
take
them
nor
can
he
or
they
ever
become
free
again
for
they
must
repay
to
their
proprietor
the
sum
he
gave
for
them
and
how
can
that
be
done
since
they
receive
no
wages
for
striking
another
a
man
may
be
in
the
same
way
as
they
term
it
forfeited
to
the
state
and
be
sold
to
the
highest
bidder
a
stout
brass
wire
is
then
twisted
around
his
left
wrist
loosely
and
the
ends
soldered
together
then
a
bar
of
iron
being
put
through
a
half
turn
is
given
to
it
which
forces
the
wire
sharply
against
the
arm
causing
it
to
fit
tightly
often
painfully
and
forms
a
smaller
ring
at
the
outside
by
this
smaller
ring
a
score
of
bondsmen
may
be
seen
strung
together
with
a
rope
to
speak
disrespectfully
of
the
prince
or
his
council
or
of
the
nobles
or
of
religion
to
go
out
of
the
precincts
without
permission
to
trade
without
license
to
omit
to
salute
the
great
all
these
and
a
thousand
others
are
crimes
deserving
of
the
brazen
bracelet
were
a
man
to
study
all
day
what
he
must
do
and
what
he
must
not
do
to
escape
servitude
it
would
not
be
possible
for
him
to
stir
one
step
without
becoming
forfeit
and
yet
they
hypocritically
say
that
these
things
are
done
for
the
sake
of
public
morality
and
that
there
are
not
slaves
not
permitting
the
word
to
be
used
and
no
man
was
ever
sold
it
is
indeed
true
that
no
man
is
sold
in
open
market
he
is
leased
instead
and
by
a
refined
hypocrisy
the
owner
of
slaves
can
not
sell
them
to
another
owner
but
he
can
place
them
in
the
hands
of
the
notary
presenting
them
with
their
freedom
so
far
as
he
is
concerned
the
notary
upon
payment
of
a
fine
from
the
purchaser
transfers
them
to
him
and
the
larger
part
of
the
fine
goes
to
the
prince
debt
alone
under
their
laws
must
crowd
the
land
with
slaves
for
as
wages
are
scarcely
known
a
child
from
its
birth
is
often
declared
to
be
in
debt
for
its
nourishment
is
drawn
from
its
mother
and
the
wretched
mother
is
the
wife
of
a
retainer
who
is
fed
by
his
lord
to
such
a
degree
is
this
tyranny
carried
if
any
owe
a
penny
his
doom
is
sealed
he
becomes
a
bondsman
and
thus
the
estates
of
the
nobles
are
full
of
men
who
work
during
their
whole
lives
for
the
profit
of
others
thus
too
the
woods
are
filled
with
banditti
for
those
who
find
an
opportunity
never
fail
to
escape
notwithstanding
the
hunt
that
is
invariably
made
for
them
and
the
cruel
punishment
that
awaits
recapture
and
numbers
foreseeing
that
they
must
become
bondsmen
before
they
are
proclaimed
forfeit
steal
away
by
night
and
live
as
they
may
in
the
forests
how
then
does
any
man
remain
free
only
by
the
favour
of
the
nobles
and
only
that
he
may
amass
wealth
for
them
the
merchants
and
those
who
have
license
to
trade
by
land
or
water
are
all
protected
by
some
noble
house
to
whom
they
pay
heavily
for
permission
to
live
in
their
own
houses
the
principal
tyrant
is
supported
by
the
nobles
that
they
in
their
turn
may
tyrannise
over
the
merchants
and
they
again
over
all
the
workmen
of
their
shops
and
bazaars
over
their
own
servants
for
thus
they
call
the
slaves
that
the
word
itself
may
not
be
used
who
work
upon
their
estates
the
nobles
are
absolute
masters
and
may
even
hang
them
upon
the
nearest
tree
and
here
i
can
not
but
remark
how
strange
it
is
first
that
any
man
can
remain
a
slave
rather
than
die
and
secondly
how
much
stranger
it
is
that
any
other
man
himself
a
slave
can
be
found
to
hunt
down
or
to
hang
his
fellow
yet
the
tyrants
never
lack
executioners
their
castles
are
crowded
with
retainers
who
wreak
their
wills
upon
the
defenceless
these
retainers
do
not
wear
the
brazen
bracelet
they
are
free
are
there
then
no
beggars
yes
they
sit
at
every
corner
and
about
the
gates
of
the
cities
asking
for
alms
though
begging
makes
a
man
forfeit
to
the
state
it
is
only
when
he
has
thews
and
sinews
and
can
work
the
diseased
and
aged
the
helpless
and
feeble
may
break
the
law
and
starve
by
the
roadside
because
it
profits
no
one
to
make
them
his
slaves
and
all
these
things
are
done
in
the
name
of
morality
and
for
the
good
of
the
human
race
as
they
constantly
announce
in
their
councils
and
parliaments
there
are
two
reasons
why
the
mercenaries
have
been
called
in
first
because
the
princes
found
the
great
nobles
so
powerful
and
can
keep
them
in
check
only
by
the
aid
of
these
foreigners
and
secondly
because
the
number
of
the
outlaws
in
the
woods
has
become
so
great
that
the
nobles
themselves
are
afraid
lest
their
slaves
should
revolt
and
with
the
aid
of
the
outlaws
overcome
them
now
the
mark
of
a
noble
is
that
he
can
read
and
write
when
the
ancients
were
scattered
the
remnant
that
was
left
behind
was
for
the
most
part
the
ignorant
and
the
poor
but
among
them
there
was
here
and
there
a
man
who
possessed
some
little
education
and
force
of
mind
at
first
there
was
no
order
but
after
thirty
years
or
so
after
a
generation
some
order
grew
up
and
these
men
then
become
aged
were
naturally
chosen
as
leaders
they
had
indeed
no
actual
power
then
no
guards
or
armies
but
the
common
folk
who
had
no
knowledge
came
to
them
for
decision
of
their
disputes
for
advice
what
to
do
for
the
pronouncement
of
some
form
of
marriage
for
the
keeping
of
some
note
of
property
and
to
be
united
against
a
mutual
danger
these
men
in
turn
taught
their
children
to
read
and
write
wishing
that
some
part
of
the
wisdom
of
the
ancients
might
be
preserved
they
themselves
wrote
down
what
they
knew
and
these
manuscripts
transmitted
to
their
children
were
saved
with
care
some
of
them
remain
to
this
day
these
children
growing
to
manhood
took
more
upon
them
and
assumed
higher
authority
as
the
past
was
forgotten
and
the
original
equality
of
all
men
lost
in
antiquity
the
small
enclosed
farms
of
their
fathers
became
enlarged
to
estates
the
estates
became
towns
and
thus
by
degrees
the
order
of
the
nobility
was
formed
as
they
intermarried
only
among
themselves
they
preserved
a
certain
individuality
at
this
day
a
noble
is
at
once
known
no
matter
how
coarsely
he
may
be
dressed
or
how
brutal
his
habits
by
his
delicacy
of
feature
his
air
of
command
even
by
his
softness
of
skin
and
fineness
of
hair
still
the
art
of
reading
and
writing
is
scrupulously
imparted
to
all
their
legitimate
offspring
and
scrupulously
confined
to
them
alone
it
is
true
that
they
do
not
use
it
except
on
rare
occasions
when
necessity
demands
being
wholly
given
over
to
the
chase
to
war
and
politics
but
they
retain
the
knowledge
indeed
were
a
noble
to
be
known
not
to
be
able
to
read
and
write
the
prince
would
at
once
degrade
him
and
the
sentence
would
be
upheld
by
the
entire
caste
no
other
but
the
nobles
are
permitted
to
acquire
these
arts
if
any
attempt
to
do
so
they
are
enslaved
and
punished
but
none
do
attempt
of
what
avail
would
it
be
to
them
all
knowledge
is
thus
retained
in
the
possession
of
the
nobles
they
do
not
use
it
but
the
physicians
for
instance
who
are
famous
are
so
because
by
favour
of
some
baron
they
have
learned
receipts
in
the
ancient
manuscripts
which
have
been
mentioned
one
virtue
and
one
only
adorns
this
exclusive
caste
they
are
courageous
to
the
verge
of
madness
i
had
almost
omitted
to
state
that
the
merchants
know
how
to
read
and
write
having
special
license
and
permits
to
do
so
without
which
they
may
not
correspond
there
are
few
books
and
still
fewer
to
read
them
and
these
all
in
manuscript
for
though
the
way
to
print
is
not
lost
it
is
not
employed
since
no
one
wants
books
chapter
v
the
lake
there
now
only
remains
the
geography
of
our
country
to
be
treated
of
before
the
history
is
commenced
now
the
most
striking
difference
between
the
country
as
we
know
it
and
as
it
was
known
to
the
ancients
is
the
existence
of
the
great
lake
in
the
centre
of
the
island
from
the
red
rocks
by
the
severn
hither
the
most
direct
route
a
galley
can
follow
is
considered
to
be
about
miles
in
length
and
it
is
a
journey
which
often
takes
a
week
even
for
a
vessel
well
manned
because
the
course
as
it
turns
round
the
islands
faces
so
many
points
of
the
compass
and
therefore
the
oarsmen
are
sure
to
have
to
labour
in
the
teeth
of
the
wind
no
matter
which
way
it
blows
many
parts
are
still
unexplored
and
scarce
anything
known
of
their
extent
even
by
repute
until
felix
aquila
time
the
greater
portion
indeed
had
not
even
a
name
each
community
was
well
acquainted
with
the
bay
before
its
own
city
and
with
the
route
to
the
next
but
beyond
that
they
were
ignorant
and
had
no
desire
to
learn
yet
the
lake
can
not
really
be
so
long
and
broad
as
it
seems
for
the
country
could
not
contain
it
the
length
is
increased
almost
trebled
by
the
islands
and
shoals
which
will
not
permit
of
navigation
in
a
straight
line
for
the
most
part
too
they
follow
the
southern
shore
of
the
mainland
which
is
protected
by
a
fringe
of
islets
and
banks
from
the
storms
which
sweep
over
the
open
waters
thus
rowing
along
round
the
gulfs
and
promontories
their
voyage
is
thrice
prolonged
but
rendered
nearly
safe
from
the
waves
which
rise
with
incredible
celerity
before
the
gales
the
slow
ships
of
commerce
indeed
are
often
days
in
traversing
the
distance
between
one
port
and
another
for
they
wait
for
the
wind
to
blow
abaft
and
being
heavy
deeply
laden
built
broad
and
for
shallows
and
bluff
at
the
bows
they
drift
like
logs
of
timber
in
canoes
the
hunters
indeed
sometimes
pass
swiftly
from
one
place
to
another
venturing
farther
out
to
sea
than
the
ships
they
could
pass
yet
more
quickly
were
it
not
for
the
inquisition
of
the
authorities
at
every
city
and
port
who
not
only
levy
dues
and
fees
for
the
treasury
of
the
prince
and
for
their
own
rapacious
desires
but
demand
whence
the
vessel
comes
to
whom
she
belongs
and
whither
she
is
bound
so
that
no
ship
can
travel
rapidly
unless
so
armed
as
to
shake
off
these
inquisitors
the
canoes
therefore
travel
at
night
and
in
calm
weather
many
miles
away
from
the
shore
and
thus
escape
or
slip
by
daylight
among
the
reedy
shallows
sheltered
by
the
flags
and
willows
from
view
the
ships
of
commerce
haul
up
to
the
shore
towards
evening
and
the
crews
disembarking
light
their
fires
and
cook
their
food
there
are
however
one
or
two
gaps
as
it
were
in
their
usual
course
which
they
can
not
pass
in
this
leisurely
manner
where
the
shore
is
exposed
and
rocky
or
too
shallow
and
where
they
must
reluctantly
put
forth
and
sail
from
one
horn
of
the
land
to
the
other
the
lake
is
also
divided
into
two
unequal
portions
by
the
straits
of
white
horse
where
vessels
are
often
and
can
not
make
way
against
the
wind
which
sets
a
current
through
the
narrow
channel
there
is
no
tide
the
sweet
waters
do
not
ebb
and
flow
but
while
i
thus
discourse
i
have
forgotten
to
state
how
they
came
to
fill
the
middle
of
the
country
now
the
philosopher
silvester
and
those
who
seek
after
marvels
say
that
the
passage
of
the
dark
body
through
space
caused
an
immense
volume
of
fresh
water
to
fall
in
the
shape
of
rain
and
also
that
the
growth
of
the
forests
distilled
rain
from
the
clouds
let
us
leave
these
speculations
to
dreamers
and
recount
what
is
known
to
be
for
there
is
no
tradition
among
the
common
people
who
are
extremely
tenacious
of
such
things
of
any
great
rainfall
nor
is
there
any
mention
of
floods
in
the
ancient
manuscripts
nor
is
there
any
larger
fall
of
rain
now
than
was
formerly
the
case
but
the
lake
itself
tells
us
how
it
was
formed
or
as
nearly
as
we
shall
ever
know
and
these
facts
were
established
by
the
expeditions
lately
sent
out
at
the
eastern
extremity
the
lake
narrows
and
finally
is
lost
in
the
vast
marshes
which
cover
the
site
of
the
ancient
london
through
these
no
doubt
in
the
days
of
the
old
world
there
flowed
the
river
thames
by
changes
of
the
sea
level
and
the
sand
that
was
brought
up
there
must
have
grown
great
banks
which
obstructed
the
stream
i
have
formerly
mentioned
the
vast
quantities
of
timber
the
wreckage
of
towns
and
bridges
which
was
carried
down
by
the
various
rivers
and
by
none
more
so
than
by
the
thames
these
added
to
the
accumulation
which
increased
the
faster
because
the
foundations
of
the
ancient
bridges
held
it
like
piles
driven
in
for
the
purpose
and
before
this
the
river
had
become
partially
choked
from
the
cloacæ
of
the
ancient
city
which
poured
into
it
through
enormous
subterranean
aqueducts
and
drains
after
a
time
all
these
shallows
and
banks
became
well
matted
together
by
the
growth
of
weeds
of
willows
and
flags
while
the
tide
ebbing
lower
at
each
drawing
back
left
still
more
mud
and
sand
now
it
is
believed
that
when
this
had
gone
on
for
a
time
the
waters
of
the
river
unable
to
find
a
channel
began
to
overflow
up
into
the
deserted
streets
and
especially
to
fill
the
underground
passages
and
drains
of
which
the
number
and
extent
was
beyond
all
the
power
of
words
to
describe
these
by
the
force
of
the
water
were
burst
up
and
the
houses
fell
in
for
this
marvellous
city
of
which
such
legends
are
related
was
after
all
only
of
brick
and
when
the
ivy
grew
over
and
trees
and
shrubs
sprang
up
and
lastly
the
waters
underneath
burst
in
this
huge
metropolis
was
soon
overthrown
at
this
day
all
those
parts
which
were
built
upon
low
ground
are
marshes
and
swamps
those
houses
that
were
upon
high
ground
were
of
course
like
the
other
towns
ransacked
of
all
they
contained
by
the
remnant
that
was
left
the
iron
too
was
extracted
trees
growing
up
by
them
in
time
cracked
the
walls
and
they
fell
in
trees
and
bushes
covered
them
ivy
and
nettles
concealed
the
crumbling
masses
of
brick
the
same
was
the
case
with
the
lesser
cities
and
towns
whose
sites
are
known
in
the
woods
for
though
many
of
our
present
towns
bear
the
ancient
names
they
do
not
stand
upon
the
ancient
sites
but
are
two
or
three
and
sometimes
ten
miles
distant
the
founders
carried
with
them
the
name
of
their
original
residence
thus
the
parts
of
the
mighty
city
of
london
became
swamps
and
the
higher
grounds
were
clad
with
bushes
the
very
largest
of
the
buildings
fell
in
and
there
was
nothing
visible
but
trees
and
hawthorns
on
the
upper
lands
and
willows
flags
reeds
and
rushes
on
the
lower
these
crumbling
ruins
still
more
choked
the
stream
and
almost
if
not
quite
turned
it
back
if
any
water
ooze
past
it
is
not
perceptible
and
there
is
no
channel
through
to
the
salt
ocean
it
is
a
vast
stagnant
swamp
which
no
man
dare
enter
since
death
would
be
his
inevitable
fate
there
exhales
from
this
oozy
mass
so
fatal
a
vapour
that
no
animal
can
endure
it
the
black
water
bears
a
floating
scum
which
for
ever
bubbles
up
from
the
putrid
mud
of
the
bottom
when
the
wind
collects
the
miasma
and
as
it
were
presses
it
together
it
becomes
visible
as
a
low
cloud
which
hangs
over
the
place
the
cloud
does
not
advance
beyond
the
limit
of
the
marsh
seeming
to
stay
there
by
some
constant
attraction
and
well
it
is
for
us
that
it
does
not
since
at
such
times
when
the
vapour
is
thickest
the
very
wildfowl
leave
the
reeds
and
fly
from
the
poison
there
are
no
fishes
neither
can
eels
exist
in
the
mud
nor
even
newts
it
is
dead
the
flags
and
reeds
are
coated
with
slime
and
noisome
to
the
touch
there
is
one
place
where
even
these
do
not
grow
and
where
there
is
nothing
but
an
oily
liquid
green
and
rank
it
is
plain
there
are
no
fishes
in
the
water
for
herons
do
not
go
thither
nor
the
kingfishers
not
one
of
which
approaches
the
spot
they
say
the
sun
is
sometimes
hidden
by
the
vapour
when
it
is
thickest
but
i
do
not
see
how
any
can
tell
this
since
they
could
not
enter
the
cloud
as
to
breathe
it
when
collected
by
the
wind
is
immediately
fatal
for
all
the
rottenness
of
a
thousand
years
and
of
many
hundred
millions
of
human
beings
is
there
festering
under
the
stagnant
water
which
has
sunk
down
into
and
penetrated
the
earth
and
floated
up
to
the
surface
the
contents
of
the
buried
cloacæ
many
scores
of
men
have
i
fear
perished
in
the
attempt
to
enter
this
fearful
place
carried
on
by
their
desire
of
gain
for
it
can
scarcely
be
disputed
that
untold
treasures
lie
hidden
therein
but
guarded
by
terrors
greater
than
fiery
serpents
these
have
usually
made
their
endeavours
to
enter
in
severe
and
continued
frost
or
in
the
height
of
a
drought
frost
diminishes
the
power
of
the
vapour
and
the
marshes
can
then
too
be
partially
traversed
for
there
is
no
channel
for
a
boat
but
the
moment
anything
be
moved
whether
it
be
a
bush
or
a
willow
even
a
flag
if
the
ice
be
broken
the
pestilence
rises
yet
stronger
besides
which
there
are
portions
which
never
freeze
and
which
may
be
approached
unawares
or
a
turn
of
the
wind
may
drift
the
gas
towards
the
explorer
in
the
midst
of
summer
after
long
heat
the
vapour
rises
and
is
in
a
degree
dissipated
into
the
sky
and
then
by
following
devious
ways
an
entrance
may
be
effected
but
always
at
the
cost
of
illness
if
the
explorer
be
unable
to
quit
the
spot
before
night
whether
in
summer
or
winter
his
death
is
certain
in
the
earlier
times
some
bold
and
adventurous
men
did
indeed
succeed
in
getting
a
few
jewels
but
since
then
the
marsh
has
become
more
dangerous
and
its
pestilent
character
indeed
increases
year
by
year
as
the
stagnant
water
penetrates
deeper
so
that
now
for
very
many
years
no
such
attempts
have
been
made
the
extent
of
these
foul
swamps
is
not
known
with
certainty
but
it
is
generally
believed
that
they
are
at
the
widest
twenty
miles
across
and
that
they
reach
in
a
winding
line
for
nearly
forty
but
the
outside
parts
are
much
less
fatal
it
is
only
the
interior
which
is
avoided
towards
the
lake
the
sand
thrown
up
by
the
waves
has
long
since
formed
a
partial
barrier
between
the
sweet
water
and
the
stagnant
rising
up
to
within
a
few
feet
of
the
surface
this
barrier
is
overgrown
with
flags
and
reeds
where
it
is
shallow
here
it
is
possible
to
sail
along
the
sweet
water
within
an
of
the
swamp
nor
indeed
would
the
stagnant
mingle
with
the
sweet
as
is
evident
at
other
parts
of
the
swamp
where
streams
flow
side
by
side
with
the
dark
or
reddish
water
and
there
are
pools
upon
one
side
of
which
the
deer
drink
while
the
other
is
not
frequented
even
by
rats
the
common
people
aver
that
demons
reside
in
these
swamps
and
indeed
at
night
fiery
shapes
are
seen
which
to
the
ignorant
are
sufficient
confirmation
of
such
tales
the
vapour
where
it
is
most
dense
takes
fire
like
the
blue
flame
of
spirits
and
these
flaming
clouds
float
to
and
fro
and
yet
do
not
burn
the
reeds
the
superstitious
trace
in
them
the
forms
of
demons
and
winged
fiery
serpents
and
say
that
white
spectres
haunt
the
margin
of
the
marsh
after
dusk
in
a
lesser
degree
the
same
thing
has
taken
place
with
other
ancient
cities
it
is
true
that
there
are
not
always
swamps
but
the
sites
are
uninhabitable
because
of
the
emanations
from
the
ruins
therefore
they
are
avoided
even
the
spot
where
a
single
house
has
been
known
to
have
existed
is
avoided
by
the
hunters
in
the
woods
they
say
when
they
are
stricken
with
ague
or
fever
that
they
must
have
unwittingly
slept
on
the
site
of
an
ancient
habitation
nor
can
the
ground
be
cultivated
near
the
ancient
towns
because
it
causes
fever
and
thus
it
is
that
as
i
have
already
stated
the
present
places
of
the
same
name
are
often
miles
distant
from
the
former
locality
no
sooner
does
the
plough
or
the
spade
turn
up
an
ancient
site
than
those
who
work
there
are
attacked
with
illness
and
thus
the
cities
of
the
old
world
and
their
houses
and
habitations
are
deserted
and
lost
in
the
forest
if
the
hunters
about
to
pitch
their
camp
for
the
night
should
stumble
on
so
much
as
a
crumbling
brick
or
a
fragment
of
hewn
stone
they
at
once
remove
at
least
a
bowshot
away
the
eastward
flow
of
the
thames
being
at
first
checked
and
finally
almost
or
quite
stopped
by
the
formation
of
these
banks
the
water
turned
backwards
as
it
were
and
began
to
cover
hitherto
dry
land
and
this
with
the
other
lesser
rivers
and
brooks
that
no
longer
had
any
ultimate
outlet
accounts
for
the
lake
so
far
as
this
side
of
the
country
is
concerned
at
the
western
extremity
the
waters
also
contract
between
the
steep
cliffs
called
the
red
rocks
near
to
which
once
existed
the
city
of
bristol
now
the
welsh
say
and
the
tradition
of
those
who
dwell
in
that
part
of
the
country
bears
them
out
that
in
the
time
of
the
old
world
the
river
severn
flowed
past
the
same
spot
but
not
between
these
cliffs
the
great
river
severn
coming
down
from
the
north
with
england
on
one
bank
and
wales
upon
the
other
entered
the
sea
widening
out
as
it
did
so
just
before
it
reached
the
sea
another
lesser
river
called
the
avon
the
upper
part
of
which
is
still
there
joined
it
passing
through
this
cleft
in
the
rocks
but
when
the
days
of
the
old
world
ended
in
the
twilight
of
the
ancients
as
the
salt
ocean
fell
back
and
its
level
became
lower
vast
sandbanks
were
disclosed
which
presently
extended
across
the
most
part
of
the
severn
river
others
indeed
think
that
the
salt
ocean
did
not
sink
but
that
the
land
instead
was
lifted
higher
then
they
say
that
the
waves
threw
up
an
immense
quantity
of
shingle
and
sand
and
that
thus
these
banks
were
formed
all
that
we
know
with
certainty
however
is
that
across
the
estuary
of
the
severn
there
rose
a
broad
barrier
of
beach
which
grew
wider
with
the
years
and
still
increases
westwards
it
is
as
if
the
ocean
churned
up
its
floor
and
cast
it
forth
upon
the
strand
now
when
the
severn
was
thus
stayed
yet
more
effectually
than
the
thames
in
the
first
place
it
also
flowed
backwards
as
it
were
till
its
overflow
mingled
with
the
reflux
of
the
thames
thus
the
inland
sea
of
fresh
water
was
formed
though
silvester
hints
what
is
most
improbable
that
the
level
of
the
land
sank
and
formed
a
basin
after
a
time
when
the
waters
had
risen
high
enough
since
all
water
must
have
an
outlet
somewhere
the
lake
passing
over
the
green
country
behind
the
red
rocks
came
pouring
through
the
channel
of
the
avon
then
farther
down
it
rose
over
the
banks
which
were
lowest
there
and
thus
found
its
way
over
a
dam
into
the
sea
now
when
the
tide
of
the
ocean
is
at
its
ebb
the
waters
of
the
lake
rush
over
these
banks
with
so
furious
a
current
that
no
vessel
can
either
go
down
or
come
up
if
they
attempted
to
go
down
they
would
be
swamped
by
the
meeting
of
the
waves
if
they
attempted
to
come
up
the
strongest
gale
that
blows
could
not
force
them
against
the
stream
as
the
tide
gradually
returns
however
the
level
of
the
ocean
rises
to
the
level
of
the
lake
the
outward
flow
of
water
ceases
and
there
is
even
a
partial
inward
flow
of
the
tide
which
at
its
highest
reaches
to
the
red
rocks
at
this
state
of
the
tide
which
happens
twice
in
a
day
and
night
vessels
can
enter
or
go
forth
the
irish
ships
of
which
i
have
spoken
thus
come
into
the
lake
waiting
outside
the
bar
till
the
tide
lifts
them
over
the
irish
ships
being
built
to
traverse
the
ocean
from
their
country
are
large
and
stout
and
well
manned
carrying
from
thirty
to
fifty
men
the
welsh
ships
which
come
down
from
that
inlet
of
the
lake
which
follows
the
ancient
course
of
the
severn
are
much
smaller
and
lighter
as
not
being
required
to
withstand
the
heavy
seas
they
carry
but
fifteen
or
twenty
men
each
but
then
they
are
more
numerous
the
irish
ships
on
account
of
their
size
and
draught
in
sailing
about
the
sweet
waters
can
not
always
haul
on
shore
at
night
nor
follow
the
course
of
the
ships
of
burden
between
the
fringe
of
islands
and
the
strand
they
have
often
to
stay
in
the
outer
and
deeper
waters
but
the
welsh
boats
come
in
easily
at
all
parts
of
the
coast
so
that
no
place
is
safe
against
them
the
welsh
have
ever
been
most
jealous
of
the
severn
and
will
on
no
account
permit
so
much
as
a
canoe
to
enter
it
so
that
whether
it
be
a
narrow
creek
or
whether
there
be
wide
reaches
or
what
the
shores
may
be
like
we
are
ignorant
and
this
is
all
that
is
with
certainty
known
concerning
the
origin
of
the
inland
sea
of
sweet
water
excluding
all
that
superstition
and
speculation
have
advanced
and
setting
down
nothing
but
ascertained
facts
a
beautiful
sea
it
is
clear
as
crystal
exquisite
to
drink
abounding
with
fishes
of
every
kind
and
adorned
with
green
islands
there
is
nothing
more
lovely
in
the
world
than
when
upon
a
calm
evening
the
sun
goes
down
across
the
level
and
gleaming
water
where
it
is
so
wide
that
the
eye
can
but
just
distinguish
a
low
and
dark
cloud
as
it
were
resting
upon
the
horizon
or
perhaps
looking
lengthways
can
not
distinguish
any
ending
to
the
expanse
sometimes
it
is
blue
reflecting
the
noonday
sky
sometimes
white
from
the
clouds
again
green
and
dark
as
the
wind
rises
and
the
waves
roll
storms
indeed
come
up
with
extraordinary
swiftness
for
which
reason
the
ships
whenever
possible
follow
the
trade
route
as
it
is
called
behind
the
islands
which
shelter
them
like
a
protecting
reef
they
drop
equally
quickly
and
thus
it
is
not
uncommon
for
the
morning
to
be
calm
the
midday
raging
in
waves
dashing
resistlessly
upon
the
beach
and
the
evening
still
again
the
irish
who
are
accustomed
to
the
salt
ocean
say
in
the
suddenness
of
its
storms
and
the
shifting
winds
it
is
more
dangerous
than
the
sea
itself
but
then
there
are
almost
always
islands
behind
which
a
vessel
can
be
sheltered
beneath
the
surface
of
the
lake
there
must
be
concealed
very
many
ancient
towns
and
cities
of
which
the
names
are
lost
sometimes
the
anchors
bring
up
even
now
fragments
of
rusty
iron
and
old
metal
or
black
beams
of
timber
it
is
said
and
with
probability
that
when
the
remnant
of
the
ancients
found
the
water
gradually
encroaching
for
it
rose
very
slowly
as
they
were
driven
back
year
by
year
they
considered
that
in
time
they
would
be
all
swept
away
and
drowned
but
after
extending
to
its
present
limits
the
lake
rose
no
farther
not
even
in
the
wettest
seasons
but
always
remains
the
same
from
the
position
of
certain
quays
we
know
that
it
has
thus
remained
for
the
last
hundred
years
at
least
never
as
i
observed
before
was
there
so
beautiful
an
expanse
of
water
how
much
must
we
sorrow
that
it
has
so
often
proved
only
the
easiest
mode
of
bringing
the
miseries
of
war
to
the
doors
of
the
unoffending
yet
men
are
never
weary
of
sailing
to
and
fro
upon
it
and
most
of
the
cities
of
the
present
time
are
upon
its
shore
and
in
the
evening
we
walk
by
the
beach
and
from
the
rising
grounds
look
over
the
waters
as
if
to
gaze
upon
their
loveliness
were
reward
to
us
for
the
labour
of
the

chapter
i
sir
felix
on
a
bright
may
morning
the
sunlight
at
five
was
pouring
into
a
room
which
face
the
east
at
the
ancestral
home
of
the
aquilas
in
this
room
felix
the
eldest
of
the
three
sons
of
the
baron
was
sleeping
the
beams
passed
over
his
head
and
lit
up
a
square
space
on
the
opposite
whitewashed
wall
where
in
the
midst
of
the
brilliant
light
hung
an
ivory
cross
there
were
only
two
panes
of
glass
in
the
window
each
no
more
than
two
or
three
inches
square
the
rest
of
the
window
being
closed
by
strong
oaken
shutters
thick
enough
to
withstand
the
stroke
of
an
arrow
in
the
daytime
one
of
these
at
least
would
have
been
thrown
open
to
admit
air
and
light
they
did
not
quite
meet
and
a
streak
of
sunshine
in
addition
to
that
which
came
through
the
tiny
panes
entered
at
the
chink
only
one
window
in
the
house
contained
more
than
two
such
panes
it
was
in
the
baroness
and
most
of
them
had
none
at
all
the
glass
left
by
the
ancients
in
their
dwellings
had
long
since
been
used
up
or
broken
and
the
fragments
that
remained
were
too
precious
to
be
put
in
ordinary
rooms
when
larger
pieces
were
discovered
they
were
taken
for
the
palaces
of
the
princes
and
even
these
were
but
sparingly
supplied
so
that
the
saying
he
has
glass
in
his
window
was
equivalent
to
he
belongs
to
the
upper
ranks
on
the
recess
of
the
window
was
an
inkstand
which
had
been
recently
in
use
for
a
quill
lay
beside
it
and
a
sheet
of
parchment
partly
covered
with
writing
the
ink
was
thick
and
very
dark
made
of
powdered
charcoal
leaving
a
slightly
raised
writing
which
could
be
perceived
by
the
finger
on
rubbing
it
lightly
over
beneath
the
window
on
the
bare
floor
was
an
open
chest
in
which
were
several
similar
parchments
and
books
and
from
which
the
sheet
on
the
recess
had
evidently
been
taken
this
chest
though
small
was
extremely
heavy
and
strong
being
dug
out
with
the
chisel
and
gouge
from
a
solid
block
of
oak
except
a
few
parallel
grooves
there
was
no
attempt
at
ornamentation
upon
it
the
lid
which
had
no
hinges
but
lifted
completely
off
was
tilted
against
the
wall
it
was
too
of
oak
some
inches
thick
and
fitted
upon
the
chest
by
a
kind
of
dovetailing
at
the
edges
instead
of
a
lock
the
chest
was
fastened
by
a
lengthy
thong
of
oxhide
which
now
lay
in
a
coil
on
the
floor
bound
round
and
round
twisted
and
intertangled
and
finally
tied
with
a
special
and
secret
knot
the
ends
being
concealed
the
thong
of
leather
secured
the
contents
of
the
chest
from
prying
eyes
or
thievish
hands
with
axe
or
knife
of
course
the
knot
might
easily
have
been
severed
but
no
one
could
obtain
access
to
the
room
except
the
retainers
of
the
house
and
which
of
them
even
if
unfaithful
would
dare
to
employ
such
means
in
view
of
the
certain
punishment
that
must
follow
it
would
occupy
hours
to
undo
the
knot
and
then
it
could
not
be
tied
again
in
exactly
the
same
fashion
so
that
the
real
use
of
the
thong
was
to
assure
the
owner
that
his
treasures
had
not
been
interfered
with
in
his
absence
such
locks
as
were
made
were
of
the
clumsiest
construction
they
were
not
so
difficult
to
pick
as
the
thong
to
untie
and
their
expense
or
rather
the
difficulty
of
getting
a
workman
who
could
manufacture
them
confined
their
use
to
the
heads
of
great
houses
the
baron
chest
was
locked
and
his
alone
in
the
dwelling
besides
the
parchments
which
were
nearest
the
top
as
most
in
use
there
were
three
books
much
worn
and
decayed
which
had
been
preserved
more
by
accident
than
by
care
from
the
libraries
of
the
ancients
one
was
an
abridged
history
of
rome
the
other
a
similar
account
of
english
history
the
third
a
primer
of
science
or
knowledge
all
three
indeed
being
books
which
among
the
ancients
were
used
for
teaching
children
and
which
by
the
men
of
those
days
would
have
been
cast
aside
with
contempt
exposed
for
years
in
decaying
houses
rain
and
mildew
had
spotted
and
stained
their
pages
the
covers
had
rotted
away
these
hundred
years
and
were
now
supplied
by
a
broad
sheet
of
limp
leather
with
wide
margins
far
overlapping
the
edges
many
of
the
pages
were
quite
gone
and
others
torn
by
careless
handling
the
abridgment
of
roman
history
had
been
scorched
by
a
forest
fire
and
the
charred
edges
of
the
leaves
had
dropped
away
in
semicircular
holes
yet
by
pondering
over
these
felix
had
as
it
were
reconstructed
much
of
the
knowledge
which
was
the
common
and
therefore
unvalued
possession
of
all
when
they
were
printed
the
parchments
contained
his
annotations
and
the
result
of
his
thought
they
were
also
full
of
extracts
from
decaying
volumes
lying
totally
neglected
in
the
houses
of
other
nobles
most
of
these
were
of
extreme
antiquity
for
when
the
ancients
departed
the
modern
books
which
they
had
composed
being
left
in
the
decaying
houses
at
the
mercy
of
the
weather
rotted
or
were
destroyed
by
the
frequent
grass
fires
but
those
that
had
been
preserved
by
the
ancients
in
museums
escaped
for
a
while
and
some
of
these
yet
remained
in
and
corners
whence
they
were
occasionally
dragged
forth
by
the
servants
for
greater
convenience
in
lighting
the
fires
the
young
nobles
entirely
devoted
to
the
chase
to
love
intrigues
and
war
overwhelmed
felix
aquila
with
ridicule
when
they
found
him
poring
over
these
relics
and
being
of
a
proud
and
susceptible
spirit
they
so
far
succeeded
that
he
abandoned
the
open
pursuit
of
such
studies
and
stole
his
knowledge
by
fitful
glances
when
there
was
no
one
near
as
among
the
ancients
learning
was
esteemed
above
all
things
so
now
by
a
species
of
contrast
it
was
of
all
things
the
most
despised
under
the
books
in
one
corner
of
the
chest
was
a
leather
bag
containing
four
golden
sovereigns
such
as
were
used
by
the
ancients
and
eighteen
pieces
of
modern
silver
money
the
debased
shillings
of
the
day
not
much
more
than
half
of
which
was
silver
and
the
rest
alloy
the
gold
coins
had
been
found
while
digging
holes
for
the
posts
of
a
new
stockade
and
by
the
law
should
have
been
delivered
to
the
treasury
all
the
gold
discovered
whether
in
the
form
of
coin
or
jewellery
was
the
property
of
the
prince
who
was
supposed
to
pay
for
its
value
in
currency
as
the
actual
value
of
the
currency
was
only
half
of
its
nominal
value
and
sometimes
less
the
transaction
was
greatly
in
favour
of
the
treasury
such
was
the
scarcity
of
gold
that
the
law
was
strictly
enforced
and
had
there
been
the
least
suspicion
of
the
fact
the
house
would
have
been
ransacked
from
the
cellars
to
the
roof
imprisonment
and
fine
would
have
been
the
inevitable
fate
of
felix
and
the
family
would
very
probably
have
suffered
for
the
fault
of
one
of
its
members
but
independent
and
determined
to
the
last
degree
felix
ran
any
risk
rather
than
surrender
that
which
he
had
found
and
which
he
deemed
his
own
this
unbending
independence
and
pride
of
spirit
together
with
scarce
concealed
contempt
for
others
had
resulted
in
almost
isolating
him
from
the
youth
of
his
own
age
and
had
caused
him
to
be
regarded
with
dislike
by
the
elders
he
was
rarely
if
ever
asked
to
join
the
chase
and
still
more
rarely
invited
to
the
festivities
and
amusements
provided
in
adjacent
houses
or
to
the
grander
entertainments
of
the
higher
nobles
too
quick
to
take
offence
where
none
was
really
intended
he
fancied
that
many
bore
him
who
had
scarcely
given
him
a
passing
thought
he
could
not
forgive
the
coarse
jokes
uttered
upon
his
personal
appearance
by
men
of
heavier
build
who
despised
so
slender
a
stripling
he
would
rather
be
alone
than
join
their
company
and
would
not
compete
with
them
in
any
of
their
sports
so
that
when
his
absence
from
the
arena
was
noticed
it
was
attributed
to
weakness
or
cowardice
these
imputations
stung
him
deeply
driving
him
to
brood
within
himself
he
was
never
seen
in
the
courtyards
or
at
the
palace
nor
following
in
the
train
of
the
prince
as
was
the
custom
with
the
youthful
nobles
the
servility
of
the
court
angered
and
disgusted
him
the
eagerness
of
strong
men
to
carry
a
cushion
or
fetch
a
dog
annoyed
him
there
were
those
who
observed
this
absence
from
the
crowd
in
the
in
the
midst
of
so
much
intrigue
and
continual
striving
for
power
designing
men
on
the
one
hand
were
ever
on
the
alert
for
what
they
imagined
would
prove
willing
instruments
and
on
the
other
the
prince
councillors
kept
a
watchful
eye
on
the
dispositions
of
every
one
of
the
least
consequence
so
that
although
but
felix
was
already
down
in
two
lists
the
one
at
the
palace
of
persons
whose
views
if
not
treasonable
were
doubtful
and
the
other
in
the
hands
of
a
possible
pretender
as
a
discontented
and
therefore
useful
man
felix
was
entirely
ignorant
that
he
had
attracted
so
much
observation
he
supposed
himself
simply
despised
and
ignored
he
cherished
no
treason
had
not
the
slightest
sympathy
with
any
pretender
held
totally
aloof
from
intrigue
and
his
reveries
if
they
were
ambitious
concerned
only
himself
but
the
most
precious
of
the
treasures
in
the
chest
were
eight
or
ten
small
sheets
of
parchment
each
daintily
rolled
and
fastened
with
a
ribbon
letters
from
aurora
thyma
who
had
also
given
him
the
ivory
cross
on
the
wall
it
was
of
ancient
workmanship
a
relic
of
the
old
world
a
compass
a
few
small
tools
valuable
because
preserved
for
so
many
years
and
not
now
to
be
obtained
for
any
consideration
and
a
magnifying
glass
a
relic
also
of
the
ancients
completed
the
contents
of
the
chest
upon
a
low
table
by
the
bedstead
were
a
flint
and
steel
and
tinder
and
an
earthenware
oil
lamp
not
intended
to
be
carried
about
there
too
lay
his
knife
with
a
buckhorn
hilt
worn
by
everyone
in
the
belt
and
his
forester
axe
a
small
tool
but
extremely
useful
in
the
woods
without
which
indeed
progress
was
often
impossible
these
were
in
the
belt
which
as
he
undressed
he
had
cast
upon
the
table
together
with
his
purse
in
which
were
about
a
dozen
copper
coins
not
very
regular
in
shape
and
stamped
on
one
side
only
the
table
was
formed
of
two
short
hewn
planks
scarcely
smoothed
raised
on
similar
planks
on
edge
at
each
end
in
fact
a
larger
form
from
a
peg
driven
into
the
wall
hung
a
disc
of
brass
by
a
thin
leathern
lace
this
disc
polished
to
the
last
degree
answered
as
a
mirror
the
only
other
piece
of
furniture
if
so
it
could
be
called
was
a
block
of
wood
at
the
side
of
the
table
used
as
a
chair
in
the
corner
between
the
table
and
the
window
stood
a
long
yew
bow
and
a
quiver
full
of
arrows
ready
for
immediate
use
besides
which
three
or
four
sheaves
lay
on
the
floor
a
crossbow
hung
on
a
wooden
peg
the
bow
was
of
wood
and
therefore
not
very
powerful
bolts
and
quarrels
were
scattered
carelessly
on
the
floor
under
it
six
or
seven
slender
darts
used
for
casting
with
the
hand
as
javelins
stood
in
another
corner
by
the
door
and
two
stouter
boar
spears
by
the
wall
a
heap
of
nets
lay
in
apparent
confusion
some
used
for
partridges
some
of
coarse
twine
for
another
lying
a
little
apart
for
fishes
near
these
the
component
parts
of
two
were
strewn
about
together
with
a
small
round
shield
or
targe
such
as
are
used
by
swordsmen
snares
of
wire
and
in
an
open
box
several
chisels
gouges
and
other
tools
a
blowtube
was
fastened
to
three
pegs
so
that
it
might
not
warp
a
hunter
horn
hung
from
another
and
on
the
floor
were
a
number
of
arrows
in
various
stages
of
manufacture
some
tied
to
the
straightening
rod
some
with
the
feathers
already
attached
and
some
hardly
shaped
from
the
elder
or
aspen
log
a
heap
of
skins
filled
the
third
corner
and
beside
them
were
numerous
stag
horns
and
two
of
the
white
cow
but
none
yet
of
the
much
dreaded
and
much
desired
white
bull
a
few
peacock
feathers
were
there
also
rare
and
difficult
to
get
and
intended
for
aurora
round
one
footpost
of
the
bed
was
a
long
coil
of
thin
hide
a
lasso
and
on
another
was
suspended
an
iron
cap
or
visorless
helmet
there
was
no
sword
or
lance
indeed
of
all
these
weapons
and
implements
none
seemed
in
use
to
judge
by
the
dust
that
had
gathered
upon
them
and
the
rusted
edges
except
the
bow
and
crossbow
and
one
of
the
boar
spears
the
bed
itself
was
very
low
framed
of
wood
thick
and
solid
the
clothes
were
of
the
coarsest
linen
and
wool
there
were
furs
for
warmth
in
winter
but
these
were
not
required
in
may
there
was
no
carpet
nor
any
substitute
for
it
the
walls
were
whitewashed
ceiling
there
was
none
the
rafters
were
visible
and
the
roof
tree
but
on
the
table
was
a
large
earthenware
bowl
full
of
meadow
orchids
and
a
bunch
of
may
in
flower
his
hat
wide
in
the
brim
lay
on
the
floor
his
doublet
was
on
the
wooden
block
or
seat
with
the
long
trousers
which
showed
every
muscle
of
the
limb
and
by
them
high
shoes
of
tanned
but
unblacked
leather
his
short
cloak
hung
on
a
wooden
peg
against
the
door
which
was
fastened
with
a
broad
bolt
of
oak
the
parchment
in
the
recess
of
the
window
at
which
he
had
been
working
just
before
retiring
was
covered
with
rough
sketches
evidently
sections
of
a
design
for
a
ship
or
galley
propelled
by
oars
the
square
spot
of
light
upon
the
wall
slowly
moved
as
the
sun
rose
higher
till
the
ivory
cross
was
left
in
shadow
but
still
the
slumberer
slept
on
heedless
too
of
the
twittering
of
the
swallows
under
the
eaves
and
the
call
of
the
cuckoo
not
far
distant
chapter
ii
the
house
of
aquila
presently
there
came
the
sound
of
a
creaking
axle
which
grew
louder
and
louder
as
the
waggon
drew
nearer
till
it
approached
a
shriek
the
sleeper
moved
uneasily
but
recognising
the
noise
even
in
his
dreams
did
not
wake
the
horrible
sounds
stopped
there
was
the
sound
of
voices
as
if
two
persons
one
without
and
one
within
the
wall
were
hailing
each
other
a
gate
swung
open
and
the
waggon
came
past
under
the
very
window
of
the
bedroom
even
habit
could
not
enable
felix
to
entirely
withstand
so
piercing
a
noise
when
almost
in
his
ears
he
sat
up
a
minute
and
glanced
at
the
square
of
light
on
the
wall
to
guess
the
time
by
its
position
in
another
minute
or
two
the
squeaking
of
the
axle
ceased
as
the
waggon
reached
the
storehouses
and
he
immediately
returned
to
the
pillow
without
and
just
beneath
the
window
there
ran
a
road
or
way
which
in
part
divided
the
enclosure
into
two
portions
the
and
its
offices
being
on
one
side
the
granaries
and
storehouses
on
the
other
but
a
few
yards
to
the
left
of
his
room
a
strong
gate
in
the
enclosing
wall
gave
entrance
to
this
roadway
it
was
called
the
maple
gate
because
a
small
maple
tree
grew
near
outside
the
wall
which
surrounded
the
whole
place
at
a
distance
of
eight
or
ten
yards
from
the
buildings
was
of
brick
and
about
nine
feet
high
with
a
ditch
without
it
was
partly
embattled
and
partly
loopholed
and
a
banquette
of
earth
rammed
hard
ran
all
round
inside
so
that
the
defenders
might
discharge
darts
or
arrows
through
the
embrasures
and
step
down
out
of
sight
to
prepare
a
fresh
supply
at
each
corner
there
was
a
large
platform
where
a
considerable
number
of
men
could
stand
and
command
the
approaches
there
were
however
no
bastions
or
flanking
towers
on
the
roof
of
the
a
similar
platform
had
been
prepared
protected
by
a
parapet
from
which
height
the
entire
enclosure
could
be
overlooked
another
platform
though
at
a
less
height
was
on
the
roof
of
the
retainers
lodgings
so
placed
as
especially
to
command
the
second
gate
entering
by
the
maple
gate
the
was
on
the
right
hand
and
the
granaries
and
general
storehouses
on
the
left
the
latter
built
on
three
sides
of
a
square
farther
on
on
the
same
side
were
the
stables
and
near
them
the
forge
and
workshops
beyond
these
again
were
the
lodgings
of
the
retainers
and
labourers
near
which
in
the
corner
was
the
south
gate
from
which
the
south
road
led
to
the
and
farms
and
out
to
the
south
upon
the
right
hand
after
the
and
connected
with
it
came
the
steward
stores
where
the
iron
tools
and
similar
valuable
articles
of
metal
were
kept
then
after
a
covered
the
kitchen
and
general
hall
under
one
roof
with
the
house
the
house
fronted
in
the
opposite
direction
to
the
roadway
there
was
a
narrow
green
lawn
between
it
and
the
enceinte
or
wall
and
before
the
general
hall
and
kitchens
a
gravelled
court
this
was
parted
from
the
lawn
by
palings
so
that
the
house
folk
enjoyed
privacy
and
yet
were
close
to
their
servitors
the
place
was
called
the
old
house
for
it
dated
back
to
the
time
of
the
ancients
and
the
aquilas
were
proud
of
the
simple
designation
of
their
fortified
residence
felix
window
was
almost
exactly
opposite
the
entrance
to
the
storehouse
or
granary
yard
so
that
the
waggon
after
passing
it
had
to
go
but
a
little
distance
and
then
turning
to
the
left
was
drawn
up
before
the
doors
of
the
warehouse
this
waggon
was
low
built
for
the
carriage
of
goods
only
of
hewn
plank
scarcely
smooth
and
the
wheels
were
solid
cut
in
fact
from
the
butt
of
an
elm
tree
unless
continually
greased
the
squeaking
of
such
wheels
is
terrible
and
the
carters
frequently
forgot
their
much
of
the
work
of
the
farm
such
as
the
carting
of
hay
and
corn
in
was
done
upon
sleds
the
waggons
there
were
but
few
of
them
being
reserved
for
longer
journeys
on
the
rough
roads
this
waggon
laden
with
wool
some
of
the
season
clip
had
come
in
four
or
five
miles
from
an
cot
or
at
the
foot
of
the
hills
in
the
buildings
round
the
granary
yard
there
were
stored
not
only
the
corn
and
flour
required
for
the
retainers
who
might
at
any
moment
become
a
besieged
garrison
but
the
most
valuable
products
of
the
estate
the
wool
hides
and
tanned
leather
from
the
besides
a
great
quantity
of
bacon
and
salt
beef
indeed
every
possible
article
that
could
be
needed
these
buildings
were
put
together
with
wooden
pins
on
account
of
the
scarcity
of
iron
and
were
all
included
roofed
with
red
tile
lesser
houses
cottages
and
sheds
at
a
distance
were
thatched
but
in
an
enclosure
tiles
were
necessary
lest
in
case
of
an
attack
fire
should
be
thrown
half
an
hour
later
at
six
the
watchman
blew
his
horn
as
loudly
as
possible
for
some
two
or
three
minutes
the
hollow
sound
echoing
through
the
place
he
took
the
time
by
the
sundial
on
the
wall
it
being
a
summer
morning
in
winter
he
was
guided
by
the
position
of
the
stars
and
often
when
sun
or
stars
were
obscured
went
by
guess
the
house
horn
was
blown
thrice
a
day
at
six
in
the
morning
as
a
signal
that
the
day
had
begun
at
noon
as
a
signal
for
dinner
at
six
in
the
afternoon
as
a
signal
that
the
day
except
in
was
over
the
watchmen
went
their
round
about
the
enclosure
all
night
long
relieved
every
three
hours
armed
with
spears
and
attended
by
mastiffs
by
day
one
sufficed
and
his
station
was
then
usually
though
not
always
on
the
highest
part
of
the
roof
the
horn
felix
it
was
the
note
by
which
he
had
been
accustomed
to
rise
for
years
he
threw
open
the
oaken
shutters
and
the
sunlight
and
the
fresh
breeze
of
the
may
morning
came
freely
into
the
room
there
was
now
the
buzz
of
voices
without
men
unloading
the
wool
men
at
the
workshops
and
in
the
granaries
and
others
waiting
at
the
door
of
the
steward
store
for
the
tools
which
he
handed
out
to
them
iron
being
so
scarce
tools
were
a
temptation
and
were
carefully
locked
up
each
night
and
given
out
again
in
the
morning
felix
went
to
the
ivory
cross
and
kissed
it
in
affectionate
recollection
of
aurora
and
then
looked
towards
the
open
window
in
the
pride
and
joy
of
youth
turning
to
the
east
the
morning
and
the
light
before
he
had
half
dressed
there
came
a
knock
and
then
an
impatient
kick
at
the
door
he
unbarred
it
and
his
brother
oliver
entered
oliver
had
been
for
his
swim
in
the
river
he
excelled
in
swimming
as
indeed
in
every
manly
exercise
being
as
active
and
energetic
as
felix
was
outwardly
languid
his
room
was
only
across
the
landing
his
door
just
opposite
it
also
was
strewn
with
implements
and
weapons
but
there
was
a
far
greater
number
of
tools
he
was
an
expert
and
artistic
workman
and
his
table
and
his
seat
unlike
the
rude
blocks
in
felix
room
were
tastefully
carved
his
seat
too
had
a
back
and
he
had
even
a
couch
of
his
own
construction
by
his
bedhead
hung
his
sword
his
most
valued
and
most
valuable
possession
it
was
one
which
had
escaped
the
dispersion
of
the
ancients
it
had
been
ancient
even
in
their
days
and
of
far
better
work
than
they
themselves
produced
broad
long
straight
and
it
appeared
capable
of
cutting
through
helmet
and
mail
when
wielded
by
oliver
sturdy
arm
such
a
sword
could
not
have
been
purchased
for
money
money
indeed
had
often
been
offered
for
it
in
vain
persuasion
and
even
covert
threats
from
those
higher
in
authority
who
coveted
it
were
alike
wasted
the
sword
had
been
in
the
family
for
generations
and
when
the
baron
grew
too
old
or
rather
when
he
turned
away
from
active
life
the
second
son
claimed
it
as
the
fittest
to
use
it
the
claim
was
tacitly
allowed
at
all
events
he
had
it
and
meant
to
keep
it
in
a
corner
stood
his
lance
long
and
sharp
for
use
on
and
by
it
his
saddle
and
accoutrements
the
helmet
and
the
shirt
of
mail
the
iron
greaves
and
spurs
the
short
iron
mace
to
bang
at
the
spoke
of
the
knight
the
man
of
horses
and
war
oliver
whole
delight
was
in
exercise
and
sport
the
boldest
rider
the
best
swimmer
the
best
at
leaping
at
hurling
the
dart
or
the
heavy
hammer
ever
ready
for
tilt
or
tournament
his
whole
life
was
spent
with
horse
sword
and
lance
a
year
younger
than
felix
he
was
at
least
ten
years
physically
older
he
measured
several
inches
more
round
the
chest
his
massive
shoulders
and
immense
arms
brown
and
hairy
his
powerful
limbs
neck
and
somewhat
square
jaw
were
the
natural
concomitants
of
enormous
physical
strength
all
the
blood
and
bone
and
thew
and
sinew
of
the
house
seemed
to
have
fallen
to
his
share
all
the
fiery
restless
spirit
and
defiant
temper
all
the
utter
recklessness
and
warrior
instinct
he
stood
every
inch
a
man
with
dark
curling
hair
brown
cheek
and
roman
chin
trimmed
moustache
brown
eye
shaded
by
long
eyelashes
and
brows
every
inch
a
natural
king
of
men
that
very
physical
preponderance
and
animal
beauty
was
perhaps
his
bane
for
his
comrades
were
so
many
and
his
love
adventures
so
innumerable
that
they
left
him
no
time
for
serious
ambition
between
the
brothers
there
was
the
strangest
mixture
of
affection
and
repulsion
the
elder
smiled
at
the
excitement
and
energy
of
the
younger
the
younger
openly
despised
the
studious
habits
and
solitary
life
of
the
elder
in
time
of
real
trouble
and
difficulty
they
would
have
been
drawn
together
as
it
was
there
was
little
communion
the
one
went
his
way
and
the
other
his
there
was
perhaps
rather
an
inclination
to
detract
from
each
other
achievements
that
to
praise
them
a
species
of
jealousy
or
envy
without
personal
dislike
if
that
can
be
understood
they
were
good
friends
and
yet
kept
apart
oliver
made
friends
of
all
and
thwacked
and
banged
his
enemies
into
respectful
silence
felix
made
friends
of
none
and
was
equally
despised
by
nominal
friends
and
actual
enemies
oliver
was
open
and
jovial
felix
reserved
and
contemptuous
or
sarcastic
in
manner
his
slender
frame
too
tall
for
his
width
was
against
him
he
could
neither
lift
the
weights
nor
undergo
the
muscular
strain
readily
borne
by
oliver
it
was
easy
to
see
that
felix
although
nominally
the
eldest
had
not
yet
reached
his
full
development
a
light
complexion
fair
hair
and
eyes
were
also
against
him
where
oliver
made
conquests
felix
was
unregarded
he
laughed
but
perhaps
his
secret
pride
was
hurt
there
was
but
one
thing
felix
could
do
in
the
way
of
exercise
and
sport
he
could
shoot
with
the
bow
in
a
manner
till
then
entirely
unapproached
his
arrows
fell
unerringly
in
the
centre
of
the
target
the
swift
deer
and
the
hare
were
struck
down
with
ease
and
even
the
in
full
flight
nothing
was
safe
from
those
terrible
arrows
for
this
and
this
only
his
fame
had
gone
forth
and
even
this
was
made
a
source
of
bitterness
to
him
the
nobles
thought
no
arms
worthy
of
men
of
descent
but
the
sword
and
lance
missile
weapons
as
the
dart
and
arrow
were
the
arms
of
retainers
his
degradation
was
completed
when
at
a
tournament
where
he
had
mingled
with
the
crowd
the
prince
sent
for
him
to
shoot
at
the
butt
and
display
his
skill
among
the
soldiery
instead
of
with
the
knights
in
the
tilting
ring
felix
shot
indeed
but
shut
his
eyes
that
the
arrow
might
go
wide
and
was
jeered
at
as
a
failure
even
in
that
ignoble
competition
only
by
an
iron
did
he
refrain
that
day
from
planting
one
of
the
despised
shafts
in
the
prince
eye
but
when
oliver
joked
him
about
his
failure
felix
asked
him
to
hang
up
his
breastplate
at
two
hundred
yards
he
did
so
and
in
an
instant
a
shaft
was
sent
through
it
after
that
oliver
held
his
peace
and
in
his
heart
began
to
think
that
the
bow
was
a
dangerous
weapon
so
you
are
late
again
this
morning
said
oliver
leaning
against
the
recess
of
the
window
and
placing
his
arms
on
it
the
sunshine
fell
on
his
curly
dark
hair
still
wet
from
the
river
studying
last
night
i
suppose
turning
over
the
parchment
why
did
you
ride
into
town
with
me
the
water
must
have
been
cold
this
morning
said
felix
ignoring
the
question
yes
there
was
a
slight
frost
or
something
like
it
very
early
and
a
mist
on
the
surface
but
it
was
splendid
in
the
pool
why
do
you
get
up
and
come
you
used
to
i
can
swim
said
felix
laconically
implying
that
having
learnt
the
art
it
no
more
tempted
him
you
were
late
last
night
i
heard
you
put
night
in
we
came
home
in
style
it
was
rather
dusky
but
night
galloped
the
green
miles
mind
she
does
put
her
hoof
in
a
rabbit
hole
some
night
not
that
she
can
see
like
a
cat
i
believe
we
got
over
the
twelve
miles
in
less
than
an
hour
sharp
work
considering
the
hills
you
inquire
for
the
news
what
the
news
to
me
well
there
was
a
quarrel
at
the
palace
yesterday
afternoon
the
prince
told
louis
he
was
a
traitor
and
louis
told
the
prince
he
was
a
suspicious
fool
it
nearly
came
to
blows
and
louis
is
banished
for
the
fiftieth
time
this
time
it
is
more
serious
do
believe
it
he
will
be
sent
for
again
this
morning
can
not
you
see
why
no
if
the
prince
is
really
suspicious
he
will
never
send
his
brother
into
the
country
where
he
might
be
resorted
to
by
discontented
people
he
will
keep
him
close
at
hand
i
wish
the
quarrelling
would
cease
it
spoils
half
the
fun
obliged
to
creep
about
the
court
and
speak
in
whispers
and
you
tell
whom
you
are
talking
to
they
may
turn
on
you
if
you
say
too
much
there
is
no
dancing
either
i
hate
this
moody
state
i
wish
they
would
either
dance
or
fight
fight
who
anybody
there
some
more
news
but
you
do
care
no
i
do
not
why
do
you
go
and
live
in
the
woods
all
by
yourself
said
oliver
in
some
heat
felix
laughed
tell
me
your
news
i
am
listening
the
irish
landed
at
blacklands
the
day
before
yesterday
and
burnt
robert
place
they
tried
letburn
but
the
people
there
had
been
warned
and
were
ready
and
there
an
envoy
from
sypolis
arrived
some
think
the
assembly
has
broken
up
they
were
all
at
daggers
drawn
so
much
for
the
holy
league
so
much
for
the
holy
league
repeated
felix
what
are
you
going
to
do
asked
oliver
after
awhile
i
am
going
down
to
my
canoe
said
felix
i
will
go
with
you
the
trout
are
rising
have
you
got
any
hooks
there
some
in
the
box
there
i
think
take
the
tools
out
oliver
searched
among
the
tools
in
the
open
box
all
rusty
and
covered
with
dust
while
felix
finished
dressing
put
away
his
parchment
and
knotted
the
thong
round
his
chest
he
found
some
hooks
at
the
bottom
and
after
breakfast
they
walked
out
together
oliver
carrying
his
rod
and
a
and
felix
a
also
in
addition
to
a
small
flag
basket
with
some
chisels
and
gouges
chapter
iii
the
stockade
when
oliver
and
felix
started
they
left
philip
the
third
and
youngest
of
the
three
brothers
still
at
breakfast
they
turned
to
the
left
on
getting
out
of
doors
and
again
to
the
left
through
the
covered
passage
between
the
steward
store
and
the
kitchen
then
crossing
the
waggon
yard
they
paused
a
moment
to
glance
in
at
the
forge
where
two
men
were
repairing
part
of
a
plough
oliver
must
also
look
for
a
moment
at
his
mare
after
which
they
directed
their
steps
to
the
south
gate
the
massive
oaken
door
was
open
the
bolts
having
been
drawn
back
at
hornblow
there
was
a
on
one
side
of
the
gate
under
the
platform
in
the
corner
where
there
was
always
supposed
to
be
a
watch
but
in
times
of
peace
and
when
there
were
no
apprehensions
of
attack
the
men
whose
turn
it
was
to
watch
there
were
often
called
away
for
a
time
to
assist
in
some
labour
going
forward
and
at
that
moment
were
helping
to
move
the
woolpacks
farther
into
the
warehouse
still
they
were
close
at
hand
and
had
the
day
watchman
or
warder
who
was
now
on
the
roof
blown
his
horn
would
have
rushed
direct
to
the
gate
felix
did
not
like
this
relaxation
of
discipline
his
precise
ideas
were
upset
at
the
absence
of
the
guard
method
organization
and
precision
were
the
characteristics
of
his
mind
and
this
kind
of
uncertainty
irritated
him
i
wish
sir
constans
would
insist
on
the
guard
being
kept
he
remarked
children
in
speaking
of
their
parents
invariably
gave
them
their
titles
now
their
father
title
was
properly
my
lord
as
he
was
a
baron
and
one
of
the
most
ancient
but
he
had
so
long
abnegated
the
exercise
of
his
rights
and
privileges
sinking
the
noble
in
the
mechanician
that
men
had
forgotten
the
proper
style
in
which
they
should
address
him
sir
was
applied
to
all
nobles
whether
they
possessed
estates
or
not
the
brothers
were
invariably
addressed
as
sir
felix
or
sir
oliver
it
marked
therefore
the
low
estimation
in
which
the
baron
was
held
when
even
his
own
sons
spoke
of
him
by
that
title
oliver
though
a
military
man
by
profession
laughed
at
felix
strict
view
of
the
guards
duties
familiarity
with
danger
and
natural
carelessness
had
rendered
him
contemptuous
of
it
there
no
risk
said
he
that
i
can
see
who
could
attack
us
the
bushmen
would
never
dream
of
it
the
romany
would
be
seen
coming
days
beforehand
we
are
too
far
from
the
lake
for
the
pirates
and
as
we
are
not
great
people
as
we
might
have
been
we
need
dread
no
private
enmity
besides
which
any
assailants
must
pass
the
stockades
first
quite
true
still
i
do
like
it
it
is
a
loose
way
of
doing
things
outside
the
gate
they
followed
the
waggon
track
or
south
road
for
about
half
a
mile
it
crossed
meadows
parted
by
low
hedges
and
they
remarked
as
they
went
on
the
shortness
of
the
grass
which
for
want
of
rain
was
not
nearly
fit
for
mowing
last
year
there
had
been
a
bad
wheat
crop
this
year
there
was
at
present
scarcely
any
grass
these
matters
were
of
the
highest
importance
peace
or
war
famine
or
plenty
might
depend
upon
the
weather
of
the
next
few
months
the
meadows
besides
being
divided
by
the
hedges
kept
purposely
cropped
low
were
surrounded
like
all
the
cultivated
lands
by
high
and
strong
stockades
half
a
mile
down
the
south
road
they
left
the
track
and
following
a
footpath
some
few
hundred
yards
came
to
the
pool
where
oliver
had
bathed
that
morning
the
river
which
ran
through
the
enclosed
grounds
was
very
shallow
for
they
were
near
its
source
in
the
hills
but
just
there
it
widened
and
filled
a
depression
fifty
or
sixty
yards
across
which
was
deep
enough
for
swimming
beyond
the
pool
the
stream
curved
and
left
the
enclosure
the
stockade
or
at
least
an
open
work
of
poles
was
continued
across
it
this
work
permitted
the
stream
to
flow
freely
but
was
sufficiently
close
to
exclude
any
one
who
might
attempt
to
enter
by
creeping
up
the
bed
of
the
river
they
crossed
the
river
just
above
the
pool
by
some
large
blocks
rolled
in
for
the
purpose
and
approached
the
stockade
it
was
formed
of
small
but
entire
trees
young
elms
firs
or
very
thick
driven
in
a
double
row
into
the
earth
the
first
or
inner
row
side
by
side
the
outer
row
filling
the
interstices
and
the
whole
bound
together
at
the
bottom
by
split
willow
woven
in
and
out
this
interweaving
extended
only
about
three
feet
up
and
was
intended
first
to
bind
the
structure
together
and
secondly
to
exclude
small
animals
which
might
creep
in
between
the
stakes
the
reason
it
was
not
carried
all
up
was
that
it
should
not
afford
a
footing
to
human
thieves
desirous
of
climbing
over
the
smooth
poles
by
themselves
afforded
no
notch
or
foothold
for
a
bushman
naked
foot
they
rose
nine
or
ten
feet
above
the
willow
so
that
the
total
height
of
the
palisade
was
about
twelve
feet
and
the
tops
of
the
stakes
were
sharpened
the
construction
of
such
palisades
required
great
labour
and
could
be
carried
out
only
by
those
who
could
command
the
services
of
numbers
of
men
so
that
a
small
proprietor
was
impossible
unless
within
the
walls
of
a
town
this
particular
stockade
was
by
no
means
an
extensive
one
in
comparison
with
the
estates
of
more
prominent
nobles
the
enclosure
immediately
surrounding
the
old
house
was
of
an
irregular
oval
shape
perhaps
a
mile
long
and
not
quite
of
a
mile
wide
the
house
being
situated
towards
the
northern
and
higher
end
of
the
oval
the
river
crossed
it
entering
on
the
west
and
leaving
on
the
eastern
side
the
enclosure
was
for
the
greater
part
meadow
and
pasture
for
here
the
cattle
were
kept
which
supplied
the
house
with
milk
cheese
and
butter
while
others
intended
for
slaughter
were
driven
in
here
for
the
last
months
of
fattening
the
horses
in
actual
use
for
riding
or
for
the
waggons
were
also
turned
out
here
temporarily
there
were
two
pens
and
rickyards
within
it
one
beside
the
river
one
farther
down
the
south
road
ran
almost
down
the
centre
passing
both
rickyards
and
leaving
the
stockade
at
the
southern
end
by
a
gate
called
the
barrier
at
the
northern
extremity
of
the
oval
the
palisade
passed
within
three
hundred
yards
of
the
house
and
there
was
another
barrier
to
which
the
road
led
from
the
maple
gate
which
has
been
mentioned
from
thence
it
went
across
the
hills
to
the
town
of
ponze
thus
anyone
approaching
the
old
house
had
first
to
pass
the
barrier
and
get
inside
the
palisade
at
each
barrier
there
was
a
cottage
and
a
though
as
a
matter
of
fact
the
watch
was
kept
in
peaceful
times
even
more
carelessly
than
at
the
inner
gates
of
the
wall
about
the
house
itself
much
the
same
plan
with
local
variations
was
pursued
on
the
other
estates
of
the
province
though
the
stockade
at
the
old
house
was
remarkable
for
the
care
and
skill
with
which
it
had
been
constructed
part
of
the
duty
of
the
watchman
on
the
roof
was
to
keep
an
eye
on
the
barriers
which
he
could
see
from
his
elevated
position
in
case
of
an
incursion
of
gipsies
or
any
danger
the
guard
at
the
barrier
was
supposed
to
at
once
close
the
gate
blow
a
horn
and
exhibit
a
flag
upon
hearing
the
horn
or
observing
the
flag
the
warder
on
the
roof
raised
the
alarm
and
assistance
was
sent
such
was
the
system
but
as
no
attack
had
taken
place
for
some
years
the
discipline
had
grown
lax
after
crossing
on
the
oliver
and
felix
were
soon
under
the
stockade
which
ran
high
above
them
and
was
apparently
as
difficult
to
get
out
of
as
to
get
into
by
the
strict
law
of
the
estate
any
person
who
left
the
stockade
except
by
the
public
barrier
rendered
himself
liable
to
the
lash
or
imprisonment
any
person
even
a
retainer
endeavouring
to
enter
from
without
by
pole
ladder
or
rope
might
be
killed
with
an
arrow
or
dart
putting
himself
into
the
position
of
an
outlaw
in
practice
of
course
this
law
was
frequently
evaded
it
did
not
apply
to
the
family
of
the
owner
under
some
bushes
by
the
palisade
was
a
ladder
of
rope
the
rungs
however
of
wood
putting
his
and
boar
spear
down
oliver
took
the
ladder
and
threw
the
end
over
the
stockade
he
then
picked
up
a
pole
with
a
fork
at
the
end
from
the
bushes
left
there
of
course
for
the
purpose
and
with
the
fork
pushed
the
rungs
over
till
the
ladder
was
adjusted
half
within
and
half
without
the
palisade
it
hung
by
the
wooden
rungs
which
caught
the
tops
of
the
stakes
he
then
went
up
and
when
at
the
top
leant
over
and
drew
up
the
outer
part
of
the
ladder
one
rung
which
he
put
the
inner
side
of
the
palisade
so
that
on
transferring
his
weight
to
the
outer
side
it
might
uphold
him
otherwise
the
ladder
when
he
got
over
the
points
of
the
stakes
must
have
slipped
the
distance
between
one
rung
and
a
second
having
adjusted
this
he
got
over
and
felix
carrying
up
the
spears
and
tackle
handed
them
to
him
felix
followed
and
thus
in
three
minutes
they
were
on
the
outer
side
of
the
stockade
originally
the
ground
for
twenty
yards
all
round
outside
the
stockade
had
been
cleared
of
trees
and
bushes
that
they
might
not
harbour
vermin
or
or
facilitate
the
approach
of
human
enemies
part
of
the
weekly
work
of
the
bailiffs
was
to
walk
round
the
entire
circumference
of
the
stockade
to
see
that
it
was
in
order
and
to
have
any
bushes
removed
that
began
to
grow
up
as
with
other
matters
however
in
the
lapse
of
time
the
bailiffs
became
remiss
and
under
the
easy
and
perhaps
too
merciful
rule
of
sir
constans
were
not
recalled
to
their
duties
with
sufficient
sharpness
brambles
and
thorns
and
other
underwood
had
begun
to
cover
the
space
that
should
have
been
open
and
young
sapling
oaks
had
risen
from
dropped
acorns
felix
pointed
this
out
to
oliver
who
seldom
accompanied
him
he
was
indeed
rather
glad
of
the
opportunity
to
do
so
as
oliver
had
more
interest
with
sir
constans
than
himself
oliver
admitted
it
showed
great
negligence
but
added
that
after
all
it
really
did
not
matter
what
i
wish
said
he
is
that
sir
constans
would
go
to
court
and
take
his
proper
position
upon
this
they
were
well
agreed
it
was
in
fact
almost
the
only
point
upon
which
all
three
brothers
did
agree
they
sometimes
talked
about
it
till
they
separated
in
a
furious
temper
not
with
each
other
but
with
him
there
was
a
distinct
track
of
footsteps
through
the
narrow
band
of
low
brambles
and
underwood
between
the
stockade
and
the
forest
this
had
been
made
by
felix
in
his
daily
visits
to
his
canoe
the
forest
there
consisted
principally
of
and
thorn
thickets
with
some
scattered
oaks
and
ashes
the
timber
was
sparse
but
the
fern
was
now
fast
rising
up
so
thick
that
in
the
height
of
summer
it
would
be
difficult
to
walk
through
it
the
tips
of
the
fronds
unrolling
were
now
not
up
to
the
knee
then
the
brake
would
reach
to
the
shoulder
the
path
wound
round
the
thickets
the
blackthorn
being
quite
impenetrable
except
with
the
axe
and
came
again
to
the
river
some
four
or
five
hundred
yards
from
the
stockade
the
stream
which
ran
from
west
to
east
through
the
enclosure
here
turned
and
went
due
south
on
the
bank
felix
had
found
a
fine
black
poplar
the
largest
and
straightest
and
best
grown
of
that
sort
for
some
distance
round
and
this
he
had
selected
for
his
canoe
stones
broke
the
current
here
into
eddies
below
which
there
were
deep
holes
and
gullies
where
alders
hung
over
and
an
aspen
spread
the
shadow
of
its
boughs
across
the
water
the
mud
formed
of
disintegrated
chalk
on
the
farther
and
shallower
side
was
only
partly
hidden
by
flags
and
sedges
which
like
a
richer
and
more
alluvial
earth
nor
did
the
bushes
grow
very
densely
on
this
soil
over
the
chalk
so
that
there
was
more
room
for
casting
the
fly
than
is
usually
the
case
where
a
stream
runs
through
a
forest
oliver
after
getting
his
tackle
in
order
at
once
began
to
cast
while
felix
hanging
his
doublet
on
an
branch
and
leaning
his
spear
against
a
tree
took
his
chisels
and
gouge
from
the
flag
basket
he
had
chosen
the
black
poplar
for
the
canoe
because
it
was
the
lightest
wood
and
would
float
best
to
fell
so
large
a
tree
had
been
a
great
labour
for
the
axes
were
of
poor
quality
cut
badly
and
often
required
sharpening
he
could
easily
have
ordered
men
to
throw
the
tree
and
they
would
have
obeyed
immediately
but
then
the
individuality
and
interest
of
the
work
would
have
been
lost
unless
he
did
it
himself
its
importance
and
value
to
him
would
have
been
diminished
it
had
now
been
down
some
weeks
had
been
hewn
into
outward
shape
and
the
larger
part
of
the
interior
slowly
dug
away
with
chisel
and
gouge
he
had
commenced
while
the
hawthorn
was
just
putting
forth
its
first
spray
when
the
thickets
and
the
trees
were
yet
bare
now
the
may
bloom
scented
the
air
the
forest
was
green
and
his
work
approached
completion
there
remained
indeed
but
some
final
shaping
and
rounding
off
and
the
construction
or
rather
cutting
out
of
a
secret
locker
in
the
stern
this
locker
was
nothing
more
than
a
square
aperture
chiselled
out
like
a
mortice
entering
not
from
above
but
parallel
with
the
bottom
and
was
to
be
closed
with
a
piece
of
wood
driven
in
by
force
of
mallet
a
little
paint
would
then
conceal
the
slight
chinks
and
the
boat
might
be
examined
in
every
possible
way
without
any
trace
of
this
being
observed
the
canoe
was
some
eleven
feet
long
and
nearly
three
feet
in
the
beam
it
tapered
at
either
end
so
that
it
might
be
propelled
backwards
or
forwards
without
turning
and
stem
and
stern
interchangeable
definitions
in
this
case
each
rose
a
few
inches
higher
than
the
general
gunwale
the
sides
were
about
two
inches
thick
the
bottom
three
so
that
although
dug
out
from
light
wood
the
canoe
was
rather
heavy
at
first
felix
constructed
a
light
shed
of
fir
poles
roofed
with
branches
over
the
log
so
that
he
might
work
sheltered
from
the
bitter
winds
of
the
early
spring
as
the
warmth
increased
he
had
taken
the
shed
down
and
now
as
the
sun
rose
higher
was
glad
of
the
shade
of
an
adjacent
beech
chapter
iv
the
canoe
felix
had
scarcely
worked
half
an
hour
before
oliver
returned
and
threw
himself
on
the
ground
at
full
length
he
had
wearied
of
fishing
the
delicate
adjustment
of
the
tackle
and
the
care
necessary
to
keep
the
hook
and
line
from
catching
in
the
branches
had
quickly
proved
too
much
for
his
patience
he
lay
on
the
grass
his
feet
towards
the
stream
which
ran
and
bubbled
beneath
and
watched
felix
chipping
out
the
block
intended
to
fit
into
the
secret
opening
or
locker
is
it
nearly
finished
then
he
said
presently
what
a
time
you
have
been
at
it
nearly
three
months
why
did
you
make
it
so
big
it
is
too
big
is
it
really
perhaps
i
want
to
put
some
things
in
it
oh
i
see
cargo
but
where
are
you
going
to
launch
it
below
the
stones
there
well
you
wo
be
able
to
go
far
there
an
old
fir
across
the
river
down
yonder
and
a
hollow
willow
has
fallen
in
besides
the
too
shallow
you
take
ground
before
you
get
half
a
mile
shall
i
of
course
you
will
that
boat
will
float
six
inches
deep
by
herself
and
i
sure
there
not
six
inches
by
the
thorns
very
awkward
why
did
you
have
a
hide
boat
made
with
a
willow
framework
and
leather
cover
then
you
might
perhaps
get
down
the
river
by
hauling
it
past
the
shallows
and
the
fallen
trees
in
two
days
time
you
would
be
in
the
hands
of
the
gipsies
and
you
would
be
sir
constans
heir
now
come
i
say
that
too
bad
you
know
i
did
mean
that
besides
i
think
i
as
much
his
heir
as
you
now
looking
at
his
sinewy
arm
at
least
he
does
listen
as
much
to
you
i
mean
the
river
runs
into
the
gipsies
country
as
straight
as
it
can
go
just
so
well
you
seem
very
cool
about
it
i
am
not
going
down
the
river
then
where
you
going
on
the
lake
whew
whistling
pooh
why
the
lake
let
me
see
to
heron
bay
it
quite
fifteen
miles
you
ca
paddle
across
the
land
but
i
can
put
the
canoe
on
a
cart
aha
why
did
you
tell
me
before
because
i
did
not
wish
anyone
to
know
do
say
anything
not
i
but
what
on
earth
or
rather
on
water
are
you
driving
at
where
are
you
going
what
the
canoe
for
i
am
going
a
voyage
but
i
will
tell
you
all
when
it
is
ready
meantime
i
rely
on
you
to
keep
silence
the
rest
think
the
boat
is
for
the
river
i
will
not
say
a
word
but
why
did
you
not
have
a
hide
boat
they
are
not
strong
enough
they
ca
stand
knocking
about
if
you
want
to
go
a
voyage
where
to
i
ca
imagine
why
not
take
a
passage
on
board
a
ship
i
want
to
go
my
own
way
they
will
only
go
theirs
nor
do
i
like
the
company
well
certainly
the
sailors
are
the
roughest
lot
i
know
still
that
would
not
have
hurt
you
you
are
rather
dainty
sir
felix
my
daintiness
does
not
hurt
you
ca
i
speak
sharply
please
yourself
a
silence
a
cuckoo
sang
in
the
forest
and
was
answered
from
a
tree
within
the
distant
palisade
felix
chopped
away
slowly
and
deliberately
he
was
not
a
good
workman
oliver
watched
his
progress
with
contempt
he
could
have
put
it
into
shape
in
half
the
time
felix
could
draw
and
design
he
could
invent
but
he
was
not
a
practical
workman
to
give
speedy
and
accurate
effect
to
his
ideas
my
opinion
is
said
oliver
that
that
canoe
will
not
float
upright
it
felix
usually
so
could
not
refrain
from
casting
his
chisel
down
angrily
but
he
picked
it
up
again
and
said
nothing
this
silence
had
more
influence
upon
oliver
whose
nature
was
very
generous
than
the
bitterest
retort
he
sat
up
on
the
sward
i
will
help
launch
it
he
said
we
could
manage
it
between
us
if
you
do
want
a
lot
of
the
fellows
down
here
thank
you
i
should
like
that
best
and
i
will
help
you
with
the
cart
when
you
start
oliver
rolled
over
on
his
back
and
looked
up
idly
at
the
white
flecks
of
cloud
sailing
at
a
great
height
old
mouse
is
a
wretch
not
to
give
me
a
command
he
said
presently
felix
looked
round
involuntarily
lest
any
one
should
have
heard
mouse
was
the
for
the
prince
like
all
who
rule
with
irresponsible
power
the
prince
had
spies
everywhere
he
was
not
a
cruel
man
nor
a
benevolent
neither
clever
nor
foolish
neither
strong
nor
weak
simply
an
ordinary
a
very
ordinary
being
who
chanced
to
sit
upon
a
throne
because
his
ancestors
did
and
not
from
any
personal
superiority
he
was
at
times
much
influenced
by
those
around
him
at
others
he
took
his
own
course
right
or
wrong
at
another
he
let
matters
drift
there
was
never
any
telling
in
the
morning
what
he
might
do
towards
night
for
there
was
no
vein
of
will
or
bias
running
through
his
character
in
fact
he
lacked
character
he
was
all
uncertainty
except
in
jealousy
of
his
supremacy
possibly
some
faint
perception
of
his
own
incapacity
of
the
feeble
grasp
he
had
upon
the
state
that
seemed
outwardly
so
completely
his
occasionally
crossed
his
mind
hence
the
furious
scenes
with
his
brother
hence
the
sudden
imprisonments
and
equally
sudden
pardons
the
spies
and
eavesdroppers
the
sequestration
of
estates
for
no
apparent
cause
and
following
these
erratic
severities
to
the
suspected
nobles
proclamations
giving
privileges
to
the
people
and
removing
taxes
but
in
a
few
days
these
were
imposed
again
and
men
who
dared
to
murmur
were
beaten
by
the
soldiers
or
cast
into
the
dungeons
yet
prince
louis
the
family
were
all
of
the
same
name
was
not
an
man
he
often
meant
well
but
had
no
stability
or
firmness
of
purpose
this
was
why
felix
dreaded
lest
some
chance
listener
should
hear
oliver
abuse
him
oliver
had
been
in
the
army
for
some
time
his
excellence
in
all
arms
and
especially
with
lance
and
sword
his
acknowledged
courage
and
his
noble
birth
entitled
him
to
a
command
however
lowly
it
might
be
but
he
was
still
in
the
ranks
and
not
the
slightest
recognition
had
ever
been
taken
of
his
feats
except
indeed
if
whispers
were
true
by
some
sweet
smiles
from
a
certain
lady
of
the
palace
who
admired
knightly
prowess
oliver
chafed
under
this
neglect
i
would
not
say
that
kind
of
thing
remarked
felix
certainly
it
is
annoying
annoying
that
is
a
mild
expression
of
course
everyone
knows
the
reason
if
we
had
any
money
or
influence
it
would
be
very
different
but
sir
constans
has
neither
gold
nor
power
and
he
might
have
had
both
there
was
a
clerk
from
the
notary
at
the
house
yesterday
evening
said
felix
about
the
debts
no
doubt
some
day
the
cunning
old
scoundrel
when
he
can
squeeze
no
more
interest
out
of
us
will
find
a
legal
quibble
and
take
the
lot
or
put
us
in
the
blue
chamber
the
first
time
the
prince
goes
to
war
and
wants
money
the
blue
chamber
will
say
can
we
get
it
weakest
sir
constans
away
with
him
yes
that
will
be
it
yet
i
wish
a
war
would
happen
there
would
be
some
chance
for
me
i
would
go
with
you
in
your
canoe
but
you
are
going
you
do
know
where
what
your
object
nothing
you
do
know
yourself
indeed
no
you
do
you
a
dreamer
i
am
afraid
it
is
true
i
hate
dreams
after
a
pause
in
a
lower
voice
have
you

felix
quietly
chipped
away
at
the
block
he
was
shaping
but
his
temper
too
was
inwardly
rising
the
same
talk
varied
in
detail
but
the
same
in
point
took
place
every
time
the
brothers
were
together
and
always
with
the
same
result
of
anger
in
earlier
days
sir
constans
had
been
as
forward
in
all
warlike
exercises
as
oliver
was
now
and
being
possessed
of
extraordinary
physical
strength
took
a
leading
part
among
men
wielding
his
with
irresistible
force
he
distinguished
himself
in
several
battles
and
sieges
he
had
a
singular
talent
for
mechanical
construction
the
wheel
by
which
water
was
drawn
from
the
well
at
the
palace
was
designed
by
him
but
this
very
ingenuity
was
the
beginning
of
his
difficulties
during
a
long
siege
he
invented
a
machine
for
casting
large
stones
against
the
walls
or
rather
put
it
together
from
the
fragmentary
descriptions
he
had
seen
in
authors
whose
works
had
almost
perished
before
the
dispersion
of
the
ancients
for
he
too
had
been
studious
in
youth
the
old
prince
was
highly
pleased
with
this
engine
which
promised
him
speedy
conquest
over
his
enemies
and
the
destruction
of
their
strongholds
but
the
nobles
who
had
the
hereditary
command
of
the
siege
artillery
which
consisted
mainly
of
could
not
endure
to
see
their
prestige
vanishing
they
caballed
traduced
the
baron
and
he
fell
into
disgrace
this
disgrace
as
he
was
assured
by
secret
messages
from
the
prince
was
but
policy
he
would
be
recalled
so
soon
as
the
prince
felt
himself
able
to
withstand
the
pressure
of
the
nobles
but
it
happened
that
the
old
prince
died
at
that
juncture
and
the
present
prince
succeeded
the
enemies
of
the
baron
having
access
to
him
obtained
his
confidence
the
baron
was
arrested
and
amerced
in
a
heavy
fine
the
payment
of
which
laid
the
foundation
of
those
debts
which
had
since
been
constantly
increasing
he
was
then
released
but
was
not
for
some
two
years
permitted
to
approach
the
court
meantime
men
of
not
half
his
descent
but
with
an
unblushing
brow
and
unctuous
tongue
had
become
the
favourites
at
the
palace
of
the
prince
who
as
said
before
was
not
bad
but
the
mere
puppet
of
circumstances
into
competition
with
these
vulgar
flatterers
aquila
could
not
enter
it
was
indeed
pride
and
nothing
but
pride
that
had
kept
him
from
the
palace
by
slow
degrees
he
had
sunk
out
of
sight
occupying
himself
more
and
more
with
mechanical
inventions
and
with
gardening
till
at
last
he
had
come
to
be
regarded
as
no
more
than
an
agriculturist
yet
in
this
obscure
condition
he
had
not
escaped
danger
the
common
people
were
notoriously
attached
to
him
whether
this
was
due
to
his
natural
kindliness
his
real
strength
of
intellect
and
charm
of
manner
or
whether
it
was
on
account
of
the
uprightness
with
which
he
judged
between
them
or
whether
it
was
owing
to
all
these
things
combined
certain
it
is
that
there
was
not
a
man
on
the
estate
that
would
not
have
died
for
him
certain
it
is
too
that
he
was
beloved
by
the
people
of
the
entire
district
and
more
especially
by
the
shepherds
of
the
hills
who
were
freer
and
less
under
the
control
of
the
patrician
caste
instead
of
carrying
disputes
to
the
town
to
be
adjudged
by
the
prince
authority
many
were
privately
brought
to
him
this
by
degrees
becoming
known
excited
the
jealousy
and
anger
of
the
prince
an
anger
cunningly
inflamed
by
the
notary
francis
and
by
other
nobles
but
they
hesitated
to
execute
anything
against
him
lest
the
people
should
rise
and
it
was
doubtful
indeed
if
the
very
retainers
of
the
nobles
would
attack
the
old
house
if
ordered
thus
the
weakness
was
his
defence
the
prince
to
do
him
justice
soon
forgot
the
matter
and
laughed
at
his
own
folly
that
he
should
be
jealous
of
a
man
who
was
no
more
than
an
agriculturist
the
rest
were
not
so
appeased
they
desired
the
baron
destruction
if
only
from
hatred
of
his
popularity
and
they
lost
no
opportunity
of
casting
discredit
upon
him
or
of
endeavouring
to
alienate
the
affections
of
the
people
by
representing
him
as
a
magician
a
thing
clearly
proved
by
his
machines
and
engines
which
must
have
been
designed
by
some
supernatural
assistance
but
the
chief
as
the
most
immediate
and
pressing
danger
was
the
debt
to
francis
the
notary
which
might
at
any
moment
be
brought
before
the
court
thus
it
was
that
the
three
sons
found
themselves
without
money
or
position
with
nothing
but
a
bare
patent
of
nobility
the
third
and
youngest
alone
had
made
any
progress
if
such
it
could
be
called
by
dint
of
his
own
persistent
efforts
and
by
enduring
insults
and
rebuffs
with
indifference
he
had
at
last
obtained
an
appointment
in
that
section
of
the
treasury
which
received
the
dues
upon
merchandise
and
regulated
the
imposts
he
was
but
a
messenger
at
every
man
call
his
pay
was
not
sufficient
to
obtain
his
food
still
it
was
an
advance
and
he
was
in
a
government
office
he
could
but
just
exist
in
the
town
sleeping
in
a
garret
where
he
stored
the
provisions
he
took
in
with
him
every
monday
morning
from
the
old
house
he
came
home
on
the
saturday
and
returned
to
his
work
on
the
monday
even
his
patience
was
almost
worn
out
the
whole
place
was
thus
falling
to
decay
while
at
the
same
time
it
seemed
to
be
flowing
with
milk
and
honey
for
under
the
baron
personal
attention
the
estate
though
so
carelessly
guarded
had
become
a
very
garden
the
cattle
had
increased
and
were
of
the
best
kind
the
horses
were
celebrated
and
sought
for
the
sheep
valued
the
crops
the
wonder
of
the
province
yet
there
was
no
money
the
product
went
to
the
notary
this
extraordinary
fertility
was
the
cause
of
the
covetous
longing
of
the
court
favourites
to
divide

aquila
felix
own
position
was
bitter
in
the
extreme
he
felt
he
had
talent
he
loved
deeply
he
knew
that
he
was
in
turn
as
deeply
beloved
but
he
was
utterly
powerless
on
the
confines
of
the
estate
indeed
the
men
would
run
gladly
to
do
his
bidding
beyond
and
on
his
own
account
he
was
helpless
manual
labour
to
plough
to
sow
to
work
on
shipboard
could
produce
nothing
in
a
time
when
almost
all
work
was
done
by
bondsmen
or
family
retainers
the
life
of
a
hunter
in
the
woods
was
free
but
produced
nothing
the
furs
he
sold
simply
maintained
him
it
was
barter
for
existence
not
profit
the
shepherds
on
the
hills
roamed
in
comparative
freedom
but
they
had
no
wealth
except
of
sheep
he
could
not
start
as
a
merchant
without
money
he
could
not
enclose
an
estate
and
build
a
house
or
castle
fit
for
the
nuptials
of
a
noble
daughter
without
money
or
that
personal
influence
which
answers
the
same
purpose
he
could
not
even
hope
to
succeed
to
the
hereditary
estate
so
deeply
was
it
encumbered
they
might
indeed
at
any
time
be
turned
forth
slowly
the
iron
entered
into
his
soul
this
hopelessness
helplessness
embittered
every
moment
his
love
increasing
with
the
passage
of
time
rendered
his
position
hateful
in
the
extreme
the
feeling
within
that
he
had
talent
which
only
required
opportunity
stung
him
like
a
scorpion
the
days
went
by
and
everything
remained
the
same
continual
brooding
and
bitterness
of
spirit
went
near
to
drive
him
mad
at
last
the
resolution
was
taken
he
would
go
forth
into
the
world
that
involved
separation
from
aurora
long
separation
and
without
communication
since
letters
could
be
sent
only
by
special
messenger
and
how
should
he
pay
a
messenger
it
was
this
terrible
thought
of
separation
which
had
so
long
kept
him
inactive
in
the
end
the
bitterness
of
hopelessness
forced
him
to
face
it
he
began
the
canoe
but
kept
his
purpose
secret
especially
from
her
lest
tears
should
melt
his
resolution
there
were
but
two
ways
of
travelling
open
to
him
on
foot
as
the
hunters
did
or
by
the
merchant
vessels
the
latter
of
course
required
payment
and
their
ways
were
notoriously
coarse
if
on
foot
he
could
not
cross
the
lake
nor
visit
the
countries
on
either
shore
nor
the
islands
therefore
he
cut
down
the
poplar
and
commenced
the
canoe
whither
he
should
go
and
what
he
should
do
was
entirely
at
the
mercy
of
circumstances
he
had
no
plan
no
route
he
had
a
dim
idea
of
offering
his
services
to
some
distant
king
or
prince
of
unfolding
to
him
the
inventions
he
had
made
he
tried
to
conceal
from
himself
that
he
would
probably
be
repulsed
and
laughed
at
without
money
without
a
retinue
how
could
he
expect
to
be
received
or
listened
to
still
he
must
go
he
could
not
help
himself
go
he
must
as
he
chopped
and
chipped
through
the
long
weeks
of
early
spring
while
the
easterly
winds
bent
the
trees
above
him
till
the
buds
unfolded
and
the
leaves
expanded
while
his
hands
were
thus
employed
the
whole
map
as
it
were
of
the
known
countries
seemed
to
pass
without
volition
before
his
mind
he
saw
the
cities
along
the
shores
of
the
great
lake
he
saw
their
internal
condition
the
weakness
of
the
social
fabric
the
misery
of
the
bondsmen
the
uncertain
action
of
the
league
the
only
thread
which
bound
the
world
together
the
threatening
aspect
of
the
cymry
and
the
irish
the
dread
north
the
vast
northern
forests
from
which
at
any
time
invading
hosts
might
descend
on
the
fertile
south
it
all
went
before
his
eyes
what
was
there
behind
the
immense
and
untraversed
belt
of
forest
which
extended
to
the
south
to
the
east
and
west
where
did
the
great
lake
end
were
the
stories
of
the
gold
and
silver
mines
of
devon
and
cornwall
true
and
where
were
the
iron
mines
from
which
the
ancients
drew
their
stores
of
metal
led
by
these
thoughts
he
twice
or
thrice
left
his
labour
and
walking
some
twenty
miles
through
the
forests
and
over
the
hills
reached
the
summit
of
white
horse
from
thence
resting
on
the
sward
he
watched
the
vessels
making
slow
progress
by
oars
and
some
drawn
with
ropes
by
gangs
of
men
or
horses
on
the
shore
through
the
narrow
straits
north
and
south
there
nearly
met
there
was
but
a
furlong
of
water
between
them
if
ever
the
north
came
down
there
the
armies
would
cross
was
the
key
of
the
world
excepting
the
few
cottages
where
the
owners
of
the
horses
lived
there
was
neither
castle
nor
town
within
twenty
miles
forced
on
by
these
thoughts
he
broke
the
long
silence
which
had
existed
between
him
and
his
father
he
spoke
of
the
value
and
importance
of
this
spot
could
not
the
baron
send
forth
his
retainers
and
enclose
a
new
estate
there
there
was
nothing
to
prevent
him
the
forest
was
free
to
all
provided
that
they
rendered
due
service
to
the
prince
might
not
a
house
or
castle
built
there
become
the
beginning
of
a
city
the
baron
listened
and
then
said
he
must
go
and
see
that
a
new
hatch
was
put
in
the
brook
to
irrigate
the
that
was
all
felix
next
wrote
an
anonymous
letter
to
the
prince
pointing
out
the
value
of
the
place
the
prince
should
seize
it
and
add
to
his
power
he
knew
that
the
letter
was
delivered
but
there
was
no
sign
it
had
indeed
been
read
and
laughed
at
why
make
further
efforts
when
they
already
had
what
they
desired
one
only
the
deep
and
designing
valentine
gave
it
serious
thought
in
secret
it
seemed
to
him
that
something
might
come
of
it
another
day
when
he
was
himself
in
power
if
that
should
happen
but
he
too
forgot
it
in
a
week
some
secret
effort
was
made
to
discover
the
writer
for
the
council
were
very
jealous
of
political
opinion
but
it
soon
ended
the
idea
not
being
supported
by
money
or
influence
fell
into
oblivion
felix
worked
on
chipping
out
the
canoe
the
days
passed
and
the
boat
was
nearly
finished
in
a
day
or
two
now
it
would
be
launched
and
soon
afterwards
he
should
commence
his
voyage
he
should
see
aurora
once
more
only
he
should
see
her
but
he
should
not
say
farewell
she
would
not
know
that
he
was
going
till
he
had
actually
departed
as
he
thought
thus
a
dimness
came
before
his
eyes
his
hand
trembled
and
he
could
not
work
he
put
down
the
chisel
and
paused
to
steady
himself
upon
the
other
side
of
the
stream
somewhat
lower
down
a
yellow
had
been
lapping
the
water
to
quench
its
thirst
watching
the
man
the
while
so
long
as
felix
was
intent
upon
his
work
the
wild
animal
had
no
fear
the
moment
he
looked
up
the
creature
sprang
back
into
the
underwood
a
dove
was
cooing
in
the
forest
not
far
distant
but
as
he
was
about
to
resume
work
the
cooing
ceased
then
a
rose
from
the
ashes
with
a
loud
clapping
of
wings
felix
listened
his
hunter
instinct
told
him
that
something
was
moving
there
a
rustling
of
the
bushes
followed
and
he
took
his
spear
which
had
been
leant
against
the
adjacent
tree
but
peering
into
the
wood
in
a
moment
he
recognised
oliver
who
having
walked
off
his
rage
was
returning
i
though
it
might
have
been
a
bushman
said
felix
replacing
his
spear
only
they
are
noiseless
any
of
them
might
have
cut
me
down
said
oliver
for
i
forgot
my
weapon
it
is
nearly
noon
are
you
coming
home
to
dinner
yes
i
must
bring
my
tools
he
put
them
in
the
basket
and
together
they
returned
to
the
rope
ladder
as
they
passed
the
pen
by
the
river
they
caught
sight
of
the
baron
in
the
adjacent
gardens
which
were
irrigated
by
his
contrivances
from
the
stream
and
went
towards
him
a
retainer
held
two
horses
one
gaily
caparisoned
outside
the
garden
his
master
was
talking
with
sir
constans
it
is
lord
john
said
oliver
they
approached
slowly
under
the
not
to
intrude
sir
constans
was
showing
the
courtier
an
early
whose
fruit
was
already
set
the
dry
hot
weather
had
caused
it
to
set
even
earlier
than
usual
a
suit
of
black
velvet
an
extremely
expensive
and
almost
unprocurable
material
brought
the
courtier
pale
features
into
relief
it
was
only
by
the
very
oldest
families
that
any
velvet
or
satin
or
similar
materials
were
still
preserved
if
these
were
in
pecuniary
difficulties
they
might
sell
some
part
of
their
store
but
such
things
were
not
to
be
got
for
money
in
the
ordinary
way
two
small
silver
bars
across
his
left
shoulder
showed
that
he
was
a
he
was
a
handsome
man
with
features
somewhat
rakish
from
late
hours
and
dissipation
but
not
the
less
interesting
on
that
account
but
his
natural
advantages
were
so
with
the
affectation
of
the
court
that
you
did
not
see
the
man
at
all
being
absorbed
by
the
studied
gesture
to
display
the
jewelled
ring
and
the
peculiarly
low
tone
of
voice
in
which
it
was
the
fashion
to
speak
beside
the
old
warrior
he
looked
a
mere
stripling
the
baron
arm
was
bare
his
sleeve
rolled
up
and
as
he
pointed
to
the
tree
above
the
muscles
as
the
limb
moved
displayed
themselves
in
knots
at
which
the
courtier
himself
could
not
refrain
from
glancing
those
mighty
arms
had
they
clasped
him
about
the
waist
could
have
crushed
his
bending
ribs
the
heaviest
blow
that
he
could
have
struck
upon
that
broad
chest
would
have
produced
no
more
effect
than
a
hollow
sound
it
would
not
even
have
shaken
that
powerful
frame
he
felt
the
steel
blue
eye
bright
as
the
sky
of
midsummer
glance
into
his
very
mind
the
high
forehead
bare
for
the
baron
had
his
hat
in
his
hand
mocked
at
him
in
its
humility
the
baron
bared
his
head
in
honour
of
the
courtier
office
and
the
prince
who
had
sent
him
the
beard
though
streaked
with
white
spoke
little
of
age
it
rather
indicated
an
abundant
a
luxuriant
vitality
lord
john
was
not
at
ease
he
shifted
from
foot
to
foot
and
occasionally
puffed
a
large
cigar
of
devon
tobacco
his
errand
was
simple
enough
some
of
the
ladies
at
the
court
had
a
fancy
for
fruit
especially
strawberries
but
there
were
none
in
the
market
nor
to
be
obtained
from
the
gardens
about
the
town
it
was
recollected
that
sir
constans
was
famous
for
his
gardens
and
the
prince
despatched
lord
john
to
old
house
with
a
gracious
message
and
request
for
a
basket
of
strawberries
sir
constans
was
much
pleased
but
he
regretted
that
the
hot
dry
weather
had
not
permitted
the
fruit
to
come
to
any
size
or
perfection
still
there
were
some
the
courtier
accompanied
him
to
the
gardens
and
saw
the
which
turned
by
a
horse
forced
water
from
the
stream
into
a
small
pond
or
elevated
reservoir
from
which
it
irrigated
the
ground
this
supply
of
water
had
brought
on
the
fruit
and
sir
constans
was
able
to
gather
a
small
basket
he
then
looked
round
to
see
what
other
early
product
he
could
send
to
the
palace
there
was
no
other
fruit
the
cherries
though
set
were
not
ripe
but
there
was
some
asparagus
which
had
not
yet
been
served
said
lord
john
at
the
prince
table
sir
constans
set
men
to
hastily
collect
all
that
was
ready
and
while
this
was
done
took
the
courtier
over
the
gardens
lord
john
felt
no
interest
whatever
in
such
matters
but
he
could
not
choose
but
admire
the
extraordinary
fertility
of
the
enclosure
and
the
variety
of
the
products
there
was
everything
fruit
of
all
kinds
herbs
of
every
species
plots
specially
devoted
to
those
possessing
medicinal
virtue
this
was
only
one
part
of
the
gardens
the
orchards
proper
were
farther
down
and
the
flowers
nearer
the
house
sir
constans
had
sent
a
man
to
the
who
now
returned
with
two
fine
bouquets
which
were
presented
to
lord
john
the
one
for
the
princess
the
prince
sister
the
other
for
any
lady
to
whom
he
might
choose
to
present
it
the
fruit
had
already
been
handed
to
the
retainer
who
had
charge
of
the
horses
though
interested
in
spite
of
himself
lord
john
acknowledging
the
flowers
turned
to
go
with
a
sense
of
relief
this
simplicity
of
manners
seemed
discordant
to
him
he
felt
out
of
place
and
in
some
way
lowered
in
his
own
esteem
and
yet
he
despised
the
rural
retirement
and
beauty
about
him
felix
and
oliver
a
few
yards
distant
were
waiting
with
rising
tempers
the
spectacle
of
the
baron
in
his
native
might
of
physique
humbly
standing
hat
in
hand
before
this
court
messenger
discoursing
on
cherries
and
offering
flowers
and
fruit
filled
them
with
anger
and
disgust
the
affected
gesture
and
subdued
voice
of
the
courtier
on
the
other
hand
roused
an
equal
contempt
as
lord
john
turned
he
saw
them
he
did
not
quite
guess
their
relationship
but
supposed
they
were
cadets
of
the
house
it
being
customary
for
those
in
any
way
connected
to
serve
the
head
of
the
family
he
noted
the
flag
basket
in
felix
hand
and
naturally
imagined
that
he
had
been
at
work
you
have
been
plough
eh
he
said
intending
to
be
very
gracious
and
condescending
very
healthy
employment
the
land
requires
some
rain
does
it
not
still
i
trust
it
will
not
rain
till
i
am
home
for
my
plume
sake
tossing
his
head
allow
me
and
as
he
passed
he
offered
oliver
a
couple
of
cigars
one
each
he
added
the
best
devon
oliver
took
the
cigars
mechanically
holding
them
as
if
they
had
been
vipers
at
arm
length
till
the
courtier
had
left
the
garden
and
the
hedge
interposed
then
he
threw
them
into
the
the
best
tobacco
indeed
the
only
real
tobacco
came
from
the
warm
devon
land
but
little
of
it
reached
so
far
on
account
of
the
distance
the
difficulties
of
intercourse
the
rare
occasions
on
which
the
merchant
succeeded
in
escaping
the
vexatious
interference
the
downright
robbery
of
the
way
intercourse
was
often
entirely
closed
by
war
these
cigars
therefore
were
worth
their
weight
in
silver
and
such
tobacco
could
be
obtained
only
by
those
about
the
court
as
a
matter
of
favour
too
rather
than
by
purchase
lord
john
would
indeed
have
stared
aghast
had
he
seen
the
rustic
to
whom
he
had
given
so
valuable
a
present
cast
them
into
a
ditch
he
rode
towards
the
maple
gate
excusing
his
haste
volubly
to
sir
constans
who
was
on
foot
and
walked
beside
him
a
little
way
pressing
him
to
take
some
refreshment
his
sons
overtook
the
baron
as
he
walked
towards
home
and
walked
by
his
side
in
silence
sir
constans
was
full
of
his
fruit
the
wall
cherry
said
he
will
soon
have
a
few
ripe
oliver
swore
a
deep
but
soundless
oath
in
his
chest
sir
constans
continued
talking
about
his
fruit
and
flowers
entirely
oblivious
of
the
silent
anger
of
the
pair
beside
him
as
they
approached
the
house
the
warder
blew
his
horn
thrice
for
noon
it
was
also
the
signal
for
dinner
chapter
vi
the
forest
track
when
the
canoe
was
finished
oliver
came
to
help
felix
launch
it
and
they
rolled
it
on
logs
down
to
the
place
where
the
stream
formed
a
pool
but
when
it
was
afloat
as
oliver
had
foretold
it
did
not
swim
upright
in
the
water
it
had
not
been
shaped
accurately
and
one
side
was
higher
out
of
the
water
than
the
other
felix
was
so
disgusted
at
this
failure
that
he
would
not
listen
to
anything
oliver
could
suggest
he
walked
back
to
the
spot
where
he
had
worked
so
many
weeks
and
sat
down
with
his
face
turned
from
the
pool
it
was
not
so
much
the
actual
circumstance
which
depressed
him
as
the
long
train
of
untoward
incidents
which
had
preceded
it
for
years
past
these
seemed
to
have
accumulated
till
now
this
comparatively
little
annoyance
was
like
the
last
straw
oliver
followed
him
and
said
that
the
defect
could
be
remedied
by
placing
ballast
on
the
more
buoyant
side
of
the
canoe
to
bring
it
down
to
the
level
of
the
other
or
perhaps
if
some
more
wood
were
cut
away
on
the
heavier
side
that
it
would
cause
it
to
rise
he
offered
to
do
the
work
himself
but
felix
in
his
gloomy
mood
would
not
answer
him
oliver
returned
to
the
pool
and
getting
into
the
canoe
poled
it
up
and
down
the
stream
it
answered
perfectly
and
could
be
easily
managed
the
defect
was
more
apparent
than
real
for
when
a
person
sat
in
the
canoe
his
weight
seemed
to
bring
it
nearly
level
it
was
only
when
empty
that
it
canted
to
one
side
he
came
back
again
to
felix
and
pointed
this
out
to
him
the
attempt
was
useless
the
boat
might
answer
the
purpose
perfectly
well
but
it
was
not
the
boat
felix
had
intended
it
to
be
it
did
not
come
up
to
his
ideal
oliver
was
now
somewhat
annoyed
at
felix
sullen
silence
so
he
drew
the
canoe
partly
on
shore
to
prevent
it
from
floating
away
and
then
left
him
to
himself
nothing
more
was
said
about
it
for
a
day
or
two
felix
did
not
go
near
the
spot
where
he
had
worked
so
hard
and
so
long
but
on
the
saturday
philip
came
home
as
usual
and
as
there
was
now
no
secret
about
the
canoe
went
down
to
look
at
it
with
oliver
they
pushed
it
off
and
floated
two
or
three
miles
down
the
stream
hauling
it
on
the
shore
past
the
fallen
fir
tree
and
then
with
a
cord
towed
it
back
again
the
canoe
with
the
exception
of
the
trifling
deficiency
alluded
to
was
a
good
one
and
thoroughly
serviceable
they
endeavoured
again
to
restore
felix
opinion
of
it
and
an
idea
occurring
to
philip
he
said
a
capital
plan
would
be
to
add
an
outrigger
and
so
balance
it
perfectly
but
though
usually
quick
to
adopt
ideas
when
they
were
good
in
this
case
felix
was
too
much
out
of
conceit
with
himself
he
would
listen
to
nothing
still
he
could
not
banish
it
from
his
mind
though
now
ashamed
to
return
to
it
after
so
obstinately
refusing
all
suggestions
he
wandered
aimlessly
about
in
the
woods
till
one
day
he
found
himself
in
the
path
that
led
to
heron
bay
strolling
to
the
shore
of
the
great
lake
he
sat
down
and
watched
a
vessel
sailing
afar
off
slowly
before
the
east
wind
the
thought
presently
occurred
to
him
that
the
addition
of
an
outrigger
in
the
manner
philip
had
mentioned
would
enable
him
to
carry
a
sail
the
canoe
could
not
otherwise
support
a
sail
unless
a
very
small
one
merely
for
going
before
the
breeze
but
with
such
a
sail
as
the
outrigger
would
bear
he
could
venture
much
farther
away
from
land
his
voyage
might
be
much
more
extended
and
his
labour
with
the
paddle
lessened
this
filled
him
with
fresh
energy
he
returned
and
at
once
recommenced
work
oliver
finding
that
he
was
again
busy
at
it
came
and
insisted
upon
assisting
with
his
help
the
work
progressed
rapidly
he
used
the
tools
so
deftly
as
to
accomplish
more
in
an
hour
than
felix
could
in
a
day
the
outrigger
consisted
of
a
beam
of
poplar
sharpened
at
both
ends
and
held
at
some
six
or
seven
feet
from
the
canoe
by
two
strong
a
mast
about
the
same
height
as
the
canoe
was
long
was
then
set
up
it
was
made
from
a
young
another
smaller
fir
supplied
the
yard
which
extended
fore
and
aft
nearly
the
length
of
the
boat
the
sail
of
coarse
canvas
was
not
very
high
but
long
and
rather
broader
at
each
end
where
the
rope
attached
it
to
the
prow
and
stern
or
rather
the
two
prows
thus
arranged
it
was
not
so
well
suited
for
running
straight
before
the
wind
as
for
working
into
it
a
feat
never
attempted
by
the
ships
of
the
time
oliver
was
delighted
with
the
appearance
of
the
boat
so
much
so
that
now
and
then
he
announced
his
intention
of
accompanying
felix
on
his
voyage
but
after
a
visit
to
the
town
and
a
glance
at
the
princess
lucia
his
resolution
changed
yet
he
wavered
one
time
openly
reproaching
himself
for
enduring
such
a
life
of
inaction
and
ignominy
and
at
another
deriding
felix
and
his
visionary
schemes
the
canoe
was
now
completed
it
was
tried
on
the
pool
and
found
to
float
exactly
as
it
should
it
had
now
to
be
conveyed
to
heron
bay
the
original
intention
was
to
put
it
on
a
cart
but
the
rude
carts
used
on
the
estate
could
not
very
well
carry
it
and
a
sledge
was
substituted
several
times
during
the
journey
through
the
forest
the
sledge
had
to
be
halted
while
the
underwood
was
cut
away
to
permit
of
its
passing
and
once
a
slough
had
to
be
filled
up
with
branches
hewn
from
fir
trees
and
bundles
of
fern
these
delays
made
it
evening
before
the
shore
of
the
creek
was
reached
it
was
but
a
little
inlet
scarce
a
bowshot
wide
at
the
entrance
and
coming
to
a
point
inland
here
the
canoe
was
left
in
charge
of
three
serfs
who
were
ordered
to
build
a
hut
and
stay
beside
it
some
provisions
were
sent
next
day
on
the
backs
of
other
serfs
and
in
the
afternoon
it
was
saturday
all
three
brothers
arrived
the
canoe
was
launched
and
they
started
for
a
trial
sail
with
a
south
wind
they
ran
to
the
eastward
at
a
rapid
pace
keeping
close
to
the
shore
till
within
a
mile
of
white
horse
there
they
brought
to
by
steering
the
canoe
dead
against
the
wind
then
transferring
the
a
rather
large
one
made
for
the
purpose
to
the
other
end
and
readjusting
the
sail
the
outrigger
being
still
to
leeward
they
ran
back
at
an
equal
speed
the
canoe
answered
perfectly
and
felix
was
satisfied
he
now
despatched
his
tools
and
various
weapons
to
the
hut
to
be
put
on
board
his
own
peculiar
yew
bow
he
kept
to
the
last
at
home
it
and
his
chest
bound
with
hide
would
go
with
him
on
the
last
day
although
in
his
original
purpose
felix
had
designed
to
go
forth
without
anyone
being
aware
of
his
intention
the
circumstances
which
had
arisen
and
the
necessary
employment
of
so
many
men
had
let
out
the
secret
to
some
degree
the
removal
of
the
tools
and
weapons
the
crossbow
darts
and
spear
still
more
attracted
attention
but
little
or
nothing
was
said
about
it
though
the
baron
and
baroness
could
not
help
but
observe
these
preparations
the
baron
deliberately
shut
his
eyes
and
went
about
his
gardening
he
was
now
too
busy
with
the
first
mowing
in
his
heart
perhaps
he
felt
that
he
had
not
done
altogether
right
in
so
entirely
retiring
from
the
world
by
doing
so
he
had
condemned
his
children
to
loneliness
and
to
be
regarded
with
contempt
too
late
now
he
could
only
obstinately
persist
in
his
course
the
baroness
inured
for
so
many
many
years
to
disappointment
had
contracted
her
view
of
life
till
it
scarcely
extended
beyond
mere
physical
comfort
nor
could
she
realize
the
idea
of
felix
approaching
departure
when
he
was
actually
gone
it
would
perhaps
come
home
to
her
all
was
now
ready
and
felix
was
only
waiting
for
the
feast
of
james
to
pay
a
last
visit
to
aurora
at
thyma
castle
the
morning
before
the
day
of
the
feast
felix
and
oliver
set
out
together
they
had
not
lived
altogether
in
harmony
but
now
at
this
approaching
change
oliver
felt
that
he
must
bear
felix
company
oliver
rode
his
beautiful
night
he
wore
his
plumed
hat
and
precious
sword
and
carried
his
lance
felix
rode
a
smaller
horse
useful
but
far
from
handsome
he
carried
his
yew
bow
and
hunting
knife
thyma
castle
was
situated
fifteen
miles
to
the
south
it
was
the
last
outpost
of
civilization
beyond
it
there
was
nothing
but
forest
and
the
wild
open
plains
the
home
of
the
gipsies
this
circumstance
of
position
had
given
baron
thyma
in
times
past
a
certain
importance
more
than
was
due
to
the
size
of
his
estate
or
the
number
of
his
retainers
during
an
invasion
of
the
gipsies
his
castle
bore
the
brunt
of
the
war
and
its
gallant
defence
indeed
broke
their
onward
progress
so
many
fell
in
endeavouring
to
take
it
that
the
rest
were
disheartened
and
only
scattered
bands
penetrated
beyond
for
this
service
the
baron
received
the
grant
of
various
privileges
he
was
looked
on
as
a
pillar
of
the
state
and
was
welcome
at
the
court
but
it
proved
an
injury
to
him
in
the
end
his
honours
and
the
high
society
they
led
him
into
were
too
great
for
the
comparative
smallness
of
his
income
rich
in
flocks
and
herds
he
had
but
little
coin
and
rather
fond
of
display
he
could
not
hold
back
he
launched
forth
with
the
usual
result
of
impoverishment
mortgage
and
debt
he
had
hoped
to
obtain
the
command
of
an
army
in
the
wars
that
broke
out
from
time
to
time
it
was
indeed
universally
admitted
that
he
was
in
every
respect
qualified
for
such
a
post
the
courtiers
and
others
however
jealous
as
is
ever
the
case
of
ability
and
real
talent
debarred
him
by
their
intrigues
from
attaining
his
object
pride
prevented
him
from
acquiescing
in
this
defeat
he
strove
by
display
and
extravagance
to
keep
himself
well
to
the
front
flaunting
himself
before
the
eyes
of
all
this
course
could
not
last
long
he
was
obliged
to
retire
to
his
estate
which
narrowly
escaped
forfeiture
to
his
creditors
so
ignominious
an
end
after
such
worthy
service
was
however
prevented
by
the
personal
interference
of
the
old
prince
who
from
his
private
resources
paid
off
the
most
pressing
creditors
to
the
last
the
old
prince
received
him
as
a
friend
and
listened
to
his
counsel
thyma
was
ever
in
hopes
that
some
change
in
the
balance
of
parties
would
give
him
his
opportunity
when
the
young
prince
succeeded
he
was
clever
enough
to
see
that
the
presence
of
such
men
about
his
court
gave
it
a
stability
and
he
too
invited
thyma
to
tender
his
advice
the
hopes
now
rose
higher
than
ever
but
again
he
was
disappointed
the
new
prince
himself
incapable
disliked
and
distrusted
talent
the
years
passed
and
the
baron
obtained
no
appointment
still
he
strained
his
resources
to
the
utmost
to
visit
the
court
as
often
as
possible
still
he
believed
that
sooner
or
later
a
turn
of
the
wheel
would
elevate
him
there
had
existed
between
the
houses
of
thyma
and
aquila
the
bond
of
the
gauntlets
hoofs
and
rings
were
preserved
by
both
and
the
usual
presents
passed
thrice
a
year
at
midsummer
christmas
and
not
much
personal
intercourse
had
taken
place
however
for
some
years
until
felix
was
attracted
by
the
beauty
of
the
lady
aurora
proud
showy
and
pushing
thyma
could
not
understand
the
feelings
which
led
his
to
retire
from
the
arena
and
busy
himself
with
cherries
and
on
the
other
hand
constans
rather
looked
with
quiet
derision
on
the
ostentation
of
the
other
thus
there
was
a
certain
distance
as
it
were
between
them
baron
thyma
could
not
of
course
be
ignorant
of
the
attachment
between
his
daughter
and
felix
yet
as
much
as
possible
he
ignored
it
he
never
referred
to
felix
if
his
name
was
incidentally
mentioned
he
remained
silent
the
truth
was
he
looked
higher
for
lady
aurora
he
could
not
in
courtesy
discourage
even
in
the
faintest
manner
the
visits
of
his
friend
son
the
knightly
laws
of
honour
would
have
forbidden
so
mean
a
course
nor
would
his
conscience
permit
him
to
do
so
remembering
the
old
days
when
he
and
the
baron
were
glad
companions
together
and
how
the
baron
aquila
was
the
first
to
lead
troops
to
his
assistance
in
the
gipsy
war
still
he
tacitly
disapproved
he
did
not
encourage
felix
felt
that
he
was
not
altogether
welcome
he
recognised
the
sense
of
restraint
that
prevailed
when
he
was
present
it
deeply
hurt
his
pride
and
nothing
but
his
love
for
aurora
could
have
enabled
him
to
bear
up
against
it
the
galling
part
of
it
was
that
he
could
not
in
his
secret
heart
condemn
the
father
for
evidently
desiring
a
better
alliance
for
his
child
this
was
the
strongest
of
the
motives
that
had
determined
him
to
seek
the
unknown
if
anything
the
baron
would
have
preferred
oliver
as
a
suitor
for
his
daughter
he
sympathized
with
oliver
fiery
spirit
and
admired
his
feats
of
strength
and
dexterity
with
sword
and
spear
he
had
always
welcomed
oliver
heartily
and
paid
him
every
attention
this
to
do
oliver
justice
was
one
reason
why
he
determined
to
accompany
his
brother
thinking
that
if
he
was
there
he
could
occupy
attention
and
thus
enable
felix
to
have
more
opportunity
to
speak
with
aurora
the
two
rode
forth
from
the
courtyard
early
in
the
morning
and
passing
through
the
whole
length
of
the
enclosure
within
the
stockade
issued
at
the
south
barrier
and
almost
immediately
entered
the
forest
they
rather
checked
their
horses
haste
fresh
as
the
animals
were
from
the
stable
but
could
not
quite
control
their
spirits
for
the
walk
of
a
horse
is
even
half
as
fast
again
while
he
is
full
of
vigour
the
turn
of
the
track
soon
shut
out
the
stockade
they
were
alone
in
the
woods
long
since
early
as
they
were
the
sun
had
dried
the
dew
for
his
beams
warm
the
atmosphere
quickly
as
the
spring
advances
towards
summer
but
it
was
still
fresh
and
sweet
among
the
trees
and
even
felix
though
bound
on
so
gloomy
an
errand
could
not
choose
but
feel
the
joyous
influence
of
the
morning
oliver
sang
aloud
in
his
rich
deep
voice
and
the
thud
thud
of
the
horses
hoofs
kept
time
to
the
ballad
the
thrushes
flew
but
a
little
way
back
from
the
path
as
they
passed
and
began
to
sing
again
directly
they
were
by
the
whistling
of
blackbirds
came
from
afar
where
there
were
open
glades
or
a
running
stream
the
notes
of
the
cuckoo
became
fainter
and
fainter
as
they
advanced
farther
from
the
stockade
for
the
cuckoo
likes
the
woodlands
that
immediately
border
on
cultivation
for
some
miles
the
track
was
broad
passing
through
thickets
of
thorn
and
low
with
immense
masses
of
tangled
underwood
between
brambles
and
woodbine
twisted
and
matted
together
impervious
above
but
hollow
beneath
under
these
they
could
hear
the
running
to
and
fro
and
scratching
at
the
dead
leaves
which
strewed
the
ground
sounds
of
clucking
deeper
in
betrayed
the
situation
of
their
nests
rushes
and
the
dead
sedges
of
last
year
up
through
which
the
green
fresh
leaves
were
thrusting
themselves
in
some
places
stood
beside
the
way
fringing
the
thorns
where
the
hollow
ground
often
held
the
water
from
rainstorms
out
from
these
bushes
a
rabbit
occasionally
started
and
bounded
across
to
the
other
side
here
where
there
were
so
few
trees
and
the
forest
chiefly
consisted
of
bush
they
could
see
some
distance
on
either
hand
and
also
a
wide
breadth
of
the
sky
after
a
time
the
thorn
bushes
were
succeeded
by
ash
wood
where
the
trees
stood
closer
to
the
path
contracting
the
view
it
was
moister
here
the
hoofs
cut
into
the
grass
which
was
coarse
and
rank
the
trees
growing
so
close
together
destroyed
themselves
their
lower
branches
rubbed
together
and
were
killed
so
that
in
many
spots
the
riders
could
see
a
long
way
between
the
trunks
every
time
the
wind
blew
they
could
hear
a
distant
cracking
of
branches
as
the
dead
boughs
broken
by
the
swaying
of
the
trees
fell
off
and
came
down
had
any
one
attempted
to
walk
into
the
forest
there
they
would
have
sunk
above
the
ankle
in
soft
decaying
wood
hidden
from
sight
by
thick
vegetation
rose
every
minute
from
these
with
a
loud
clatter
of
wings
their
calls
resounded
continually
now
deep
in
the
forest
and
now
close
at
hand
it
was
evident
that
a
large
flock
of
them
had
their
here
and
indeed
their
nests
of
twigs
could
be
frequently
seen
from
the
path
there
seemed
no
other
birds
again
the
forest
changed
and
the
track
passing
on
higher
ground
entered
among
firs
these
too
had
killed
each
other
by
growing
so
thickly
the
lower
branches
of
many
were
dead
and
there
was
nothing
but
a
little
green
at
the
tops
while
in
many
places
there
was
an
open
space
where
they
had
decayed
away
altogether
brambles
covered
the
ground
in
these
open
places
brambles
and
furze
now
bright
with
golden
blossom
the
jays
screeched
loudly
startled
as
the
riders
passed
under
them
and
fluttered
away
rabbits
which
they
saw
again
here
dived
into
their
burrows
between
the
first
the
track
was
very
narrow
and
they
could
not
conveniently
ride
side
by
side
oliver
took
the
lead
and
felix
followed
chapter
vii
the
forest
track
continued
once
as
they
trotted
by
a
pheasant
rose
screaming
from
the
furze
and
flew
before
them
down
the
track
just
afterwards
felix
who
had
been
previously
looking
very
carefully
into
the
firs
upon
his
right
hand
suddenly
stopped
and
oliver
finding
this
pulled
up
as
quickly
as
he
could
thinking
that
felix
wished
to
tighten
his
girth
what
is
it
he
asked
turning
round
in
his
saddle
hush
said
felix
dismounting
his
horse
trained
to
hunting
stood
perfectly
still
and
would
have
remained
within
a
few
yards
of
the
spot
by
the
hour
together
oliver
reined
back
seeing
felix
about
to
bend
and
string
his
bow
bushmen
whispered
felix
as
he
having
fitted
the
loop
to
the
horn
notch
drew
forth
an
arrow
from
his
girdle
where
he
carried
two
or
three
more
ready
to
hand
than
in
the
quiver
on
his
shoulder
i
thought
i
saw
signs
of
them
some
time
since
and
now
i
am
nearly
sure
stay
here
a
moment
he
stepped
aside
from
the
track
in
among
the
firs
which
just
there
were
far
apart
and
went
to
a
willow
bush
standing
by
some
furze
he
had
noticed
that
one
small
branch
on
the
outer
part
of
the
bush
was
snapped
off
though
green
and
only
hung
by
the
bark
the
wood
cattle
had
they
browsed
upon
it
would
have
nibbled
the
tenderest
leaves
at
the
end
of
the
bough
nor
did
they
usually
touch
willow
for
the
shoots
are
bitter
and
astringent
nor
would
the
deer
touch
it
in
the
spring
when
they
had
so
wide
a
choice
of
food
nothing
could
have
broken
the
branch
in
that
manner
unless
it
was
the
hand
of
a
man
or
a
blow
with
a
heavy
stick
wielded
by
a
human
hand
on
coming
to
the
bush
he
saw
that
the
fracture
was
very
recent
for
the
bough
was
perfectly
green
it
had
not
turned
brown
and
the
bark
was
still
soft
with
sap
it
had
not
been
cut
with
a
knife
or
any
sharp
instrument
it
had
been
broken
by
rude
violence
and
not
divided
the
next
thing
to
catch
his
eye
was
the
appearance
of
a
larger
branch
farther
inside
the
bush
this
was
not
broken
but
a
part
of
the
bark
was
abraded
and
even
torn
up
from
the
wood
as
if
by
the
impact
of
some
hard
substance
as
a
stone
thrown
with
great
force
he
examined
the
ground
but
there
was
no
stone
visible
and
on
again
looking
at
the
bark
he
concluded
that
it
had
not
been
done
with
a
stone
at
all
because
the
abraded
portion
was
not
cut
the
blow
had
been
delivered
by
something
without
edges
or
projections
he
had
now
no
longer
any
doubt
that
the
lesser
branch
outside
had
been
broken
and
the
large
inside
branch
bruised
by
the
passage
of
a
bushman
these
their
only
missile
weapons
are
usually
made
of
and
consist
of
a
very
thin
short
handle
with
a
large
heavy
and
smooth
knob
with
these
they
can
bring
down
small
game
as
rabbits
or
hares
or
a
fawn
even
breaking
the
legs
of
deer
or
the
large
birds
as
the
stealing
up
noiselessly
within
ten
yards
the
bushman
throws
his
club
with
great
force
and
rarely
misses
his
aim
if
not
killed
at
once
the
game
is
certain
to
be
stunned
and
is
much
more
easily
secured
than
if
wounded
with
an
arrow
for
with
an
arrow
in
its
wing
a
large
bird
will
flutter
along
the
ground
and
perhaps
creep
into
sedges
or
under
impenetrable
bushes
deprived
of
motion
by
the
blow
of
the
club
it
can
on
the
other
hand
be
picked
up
without
trouble
and
without
the
aid
of
a
dog
and
if
not
dead
is
despatched
by
a
twist
of
the
bushman
fingers
or
a
thrust
from
his
spud
the
spud
is
at
once
his
dagger
his
knife
and
fork
his
chisel
his
and
his
gouge
it
is
a
piece
of
iron
rarely
or
never
of
steel
for
he
does
not
know
how
to
harden
it
about
ten
inches
long
an
inch
and
a
half
wide
at
the
top
or
broadest
end
where
it
is
shaped
and
sharpened
like
a
chisel
only
with
the
edge
not
straight
but
sloping
and
from
thence
tapering
to
a
point
at
the
other
the
pointed
part
being
like
a
nail
it
has
indeed
been
supposed
that
the
original
spud
was
formed
from
a
large
nail
such
as
the
ancients
used
sharpened
on
a
stone
at
one
end
and
beaten
out
flat
at
the
other
this
instrument
has
a
handle
in
the
middle
between
the
chisel
end
and
the
point
the
handle
is
of
horn
or
bone
the
spud
being
put
through
the
hollow
of
the
bone
smoothed
to
fit
the
hand
with
the
chisel
end
he
cuts
up
his
game
and
his
food
the
edge
being
sloping
is
drawn
across
the
meat
and
divides
it
with
this
end
too
he
fashions
his
club
and
his
traps
and
digs
up
the
roots
he
uses
the
other
end
he
runs
into
his
meat
as
a
fork
or
thrusts
it
into
the
neck
of
his
game
to
kill
it
and
let
out
the
blood
or
with
it
stabs
a
sleeping
enemy
the
stab
delivered
by
the
bushman
can
always
be
distinguished
because
the
wound
is
invariably
square
and
thus
a
clue
only
too
certain
has
often
been
afforded
to
the
assassin
of
many
an
unfortunate
hunter
whatever
the
bushman
in
this
case
had
hurled
his
club
at
the
club
had
gone
into
the
willow
bush
snapping
the
light
branch
and
leaving
its
mark
upon
the
bark
of
the
larger
a
moment
reflection
convinced
felix
that
the
bushman
had
been
in
chase
of
a
pheasant
only
a
few
moments
previously
a
pheasant
had
flown
before
them
down
the
track
and
where
there
was
one
pheasant
there
were
generally
several
more
in
the
immediate
neighbourhood
the
bushmen
were
known
to
be
peculiarly
fond
of
the
pheasant
pursuing
them
all
the
year
round
without
reference
to
the
breeding
season
and
so
continuously
that
it
was
believed
they
caused
these
birds
to
be
much
less
numerous
notwithstanding
the
vast
extent
of
the
forests
than
they
would
otherwise
have
been
from
the
fresh
appearance
of
the
snapped
bough
the
bushman
must
have
passed
but
a
few
hours
previously
probably
at
the
dawn
and
was
very
likely
concealed
at
that
moment
near
at
hand
in
the
forest
perhaps
within
a
hundred
yards
felix
looked
carefully
round
but
could
see
nothing
there
were
the
trees
not
one
of
them
large
enough
to
hide
a
man
behind
it
the
furze
branches
were
small
and
scattered
and
there
was
not
sufficient
fern
to
conceal
anything
the
keenest
glance
could
discern
nothing
more
there
were
no
footmarks
on
the
ground
indeed
the
dry
dead
leaves
and
fir
needles
could
hardly
have
received
any
impression
and
up
in
the
firs
the
branches
were
thin
and
the
sky
could
be
seen
through
them
whether
the
bushman
was
lying
in
some
slight
depression
of
the
ground
or
whether
he
had
covered
himself
with
dead
leaves
and
fir
needles
or
whether
he
had
gone
on
and
was
miles
away
there
was
nothing
to
show
but
of
the
fact
that
he
had
been
there
felix
was
perfectly
certain
he
returned
towards
oliver
thoughtful
and
not
without
some
anxiety
for
he
did
not
like
the
idea
though
there
was
really
little
or
no
danger
of
these
human
wild
beasts
being
so
near
aurora
while
he
should
so
soon
be
far
away
thus
occupied
he
did
not
heed
his
steps
and
suddenly
felt
something
soft
under
his
feet
which
struggled
instantaneously
he
sprang
as
far
as
he
could
shuddering
for
he
had
crushed
an
adder
and
but
just
escaped
by
his
involuntary
and
mechanical
leap
from
its
venom
in
the
warm
sunshine
the
viper
in
its
gravid
state
had
not
cared
to
move
as
usual
on
hearing
his
approach
he
had
stepped
full
upon
it
he
hastened
from
the
spot
and
rejoined
oliver
in
a
somewhat
shaken
state
of
mind
common
as
such
an
incident
was
in
the
woods
where
sandy
soil
warned
the
hunter
to
be
careful
it
seemed
ominous
that
particular
morning
and
joined
with
the
discovery
of
bushman
traces
quite
destroyed
his
sense
of
the
beauty
of
the
day
on
hearing
the
condition
of
the
willow
boughs
oliver
agreed
as
to
the
cause
and
said
that
they
must
remember
to
warn
the
baron
shepherds
that
the
bushmen
who
had
not
been
seen
for
some
time
were
about
soon
afterwards
they
emerged
from
the
sombre
firs
and
crossed
a
wide
and
sloping
ground
almost
bare
of
trees
where
a
forest
fire
last
year
had
swept
away
the
underwood
a
verdant
growth
of
grass
was
now
springing
up
here
they
could
canter
side
by
side
the
sunshine
poured
down
and
birds
were
singing
joyously
but
they
soon
passed
it
and
checked
their
speed
on
entering
the
trees
again
tall
beeches
with
round
smooth
trunks
stood
thick
and
close
upon
the
dry
and
rising
ground
their
boughs
met
overhead
forming
a
green
continuous
arch
for
miles
the
space
between
was
filled
with
brake
fern
now
fast
growing
up
and
the
track
itself
was
green
with
moss
as
they
came
into
this
beautiful
place
a
red
stag
startled
from
his
browsing
bounded
down
the
track
his
swift
leaps
carried
him
away
like
the
wind
in
another
moment
he
left
the
path
and
sprang
among
the
fern
and
was
seen
only
in
glimpses
as
he
passed
between
the
beeches
squirrels
ran
up
the
trunks
as
they
approached
they
could
see
many
on
the
ground
in
among
the
trees
and
passed
under
others
on
the
branches
high
above
them
woodpeckers
flashed
across
the
avenue
once
oliver
pointed
out
the
long
lean
flank
of
a
grey
pig
or
as
the
animal
rushed
away
among
the
brake
there
were
several
glades
from
one
of
which
they
startled
a
few
deer
whose
tails
only
were
seen
as
they
bounded
into
the
underwood
but
after
the
glades
came
the
beeches
again
beeches
always
form
the
most
beautiful
forest
beeches
and
oak
and
though
nearing
the
end
of
their
journey
they
regretted
when
they
emerged
from
these
trees
and
saw
the
castle
before
them
the
ground
suddenly
sloped
down
into
a
valley
beyond
which
rose
the
downs
the
castle
stood
on
a
green
isolated
low
hill
about
across
the
vale
to
the
left
a
river
wound
past
to
the
right
the
beech
forest
extended
as
far
as
the
eye
could
see
the
slope
at
their
feet
had
been
cleared
of
all
but
a
few
hawthorn
bushes
it
was
not
enclosed
but
a
neatherd
was
there
with
his
cattle
half
a
mile
away
sitting
himself
at
the
foot
of
a
beech
while
the
cattle
grazed
below
him
down
in
the
valley
the
stockade
began
it
was
not
wide
but
long
the
enclosure
extended
on
the
left
to
the
bank
of
the
river
and
two
fields
on
the
other
side
of
it
on
the
right
it
reached
a
mile
and
a
half
or
nearly
the
whole
of
which
was
overlooked
from
the
spot
where
they
had
passed
within
the
enclosures
the
corn
crops
were
green
and
flourishing
horses
and
cattle
ricks
and
various
buildings
were
scattered
about
it
the
town
or
cottages
of
the
serfs
were
on
the
bank
of
the
river
immediately
beyond
the
castle
on
the
downs
which
rose
a
mile
or
more
on
the
other
side
of
the
castle
sheep
were
feeding
part
of
the
ridge
was
wooded
and
part
open
thus
the
cultivated
and
enclosed
valley
was
everywhere
shut
in
with
woods
and
hills
the
isolated
round
hill
on
which
the
castle
stood
was
itself
enclosed
with
a
second
stockade
the
edge
of
the
brow
above
that
again
was
defended
by
a
stout
high
wall
of
flints
and
mortar
crenellated
at
the
top
there
were
no
towers
or
bastions
an
old
and
building
stood
inside
the
wall
it
dated
from
the
time
of
the
ancients
it
had
several
gables
and
was
roofed
with
tiles
this
was
the
the
gardens
were
situated
on
the
slope
between
the
wall
and
the
inner
stockade
peaceful
as
the
scene
appeared
it
had
been
the
site
of
furious
fighting
not
many
years
ago
the
downs
trended
to
the
south
where
the
romany
and
the
zingari
resided
and
a
keen
watch
was
kept
both
from
the
wall
and
from
the
hills
beyond
they
now
rode
slowly
down
the
slope
and
in
a
few
minutes
reached
the
barrier
or
gateway
in
the
outer
stockade
they
had
been
observed
and
the
guard
called
by
the
warden
but
as
they
approached
were
recognised
and
the
gate
swang
open
before
them
walking
their
horses
they
crossed
to
the
hill
and
were
as
easily
admitted
to
the
second
enclosure
at
the
gate
of
the
wall
they
dismounted
and
waited
while
the
warden
carried
the
intelligence
of
their
arrival
to
the
family
a
moment
later
and
the
baron
son
advanced
from
the
porch
and
from
the
open
window
the
baroness
and
aurora
beckoned
to
them
chapter

castle
soon
afterwards
the
hollow
sound
of
the
warden
horn
from
the
watch
over
the
gate
of
the
wall
proclaimed
the
hour
of
noon
and
they
all
assembled
for
dinner
in
the
banqueting
chamber
the
apartment
was
on
the
ground
floor
and
separated
from
the
larger
hall
only
by
an
internal
wall
the
house
erected
in
the
time
of
the
ancients
was
not
designed
for
our
present
style
of
life
it
possessed
indeed
many
comforts
and
conveniences
which
are
scarcely
now
to
be
found
in
the
finest
palaces
but
it
lacked
the
breadth
of
construction
which
our
architects
have
now
in
view
in
the
front
there
were
originally
only
two
rooms
extensive
for
those
old
days
but
not
sufficiently
so
for
ours
one
of
these
had
therefore
been
enlarged
by
throwing
into
it
a
back
room
and
part
of
the
entrance
and
even
then
it
was
not
long
enough
for
the
baron
retainers
and
at
a
wooden
shed
was
built
opposite
and
up
to
the
window
to
continue
as
it
were
the
apartment
out
of
doors
workmen
were
busy
putting
up
this
shed
when
they
arrived
the
second
apartment
retained
its
ancient
form
and
was
used
as
the
on
ordinary
days
it
was
lighted
by
a
large
window
now
thrown
wide
open
that
the
sweet
spring
air
might
enter
which
window
was
the
pride
of
the
baroness
for
it
contained
more
true
glass
than
any
window
in
the
palace
of
the
prince
the
glass
made
now
is
not
transparent
but
merely
translucent
it
indeed
admits
light
after
a
fashion
but
it
is
thick
and
can
not
be
seen
through
these
panes
were
almost
all
the
central
casement
wholly
of
ancient
glass
preserved
with
the
greatest
care
through
the
long
years
past
three
tables
were
arranged
in
an
open
square
the
baron
and
chairs
of
oak
faced
the
window
the
guests
sat
at
the
other
tables
sideways
to
them
the
servants
moved
on
the
outer
side
and
thus
placed
the
food
before
them
without
pushing
against
or
incommoding
them
a
fourth
table
was
placed
in
a
corner
between
the
fireplace
and
the
window
at
it
sat
the
old
nurse
the
housekeeper
frequently
arising
to
order
the
servants
and
the
baron
henchman
who
had
taught
him
to
ride
but
now
grey
and
aged
could
not
mount
himself
without
assistance
and
had
long
ceased
from
active
service
already
eight
or
nine
guests
had
arrived
besides
felix
and
oliver
some
had
ridden
a
great
distance
to
be
present
at
the
house
day
they
were
all
nobles
richly
dressed
one
or
two
of
the
eldest
were
wealthy
and
powerful
men
and
the
youngest
was
the
son
and
heir
of
the
earl
of
essiton
who
was
then
the
favourite
at
court
each
had
come
with
his
personal
attendants
the
young
lord
durand
brought
with
him
retainers
and
six
gentlemen
friends
all
of
whom
were
lodged
in
the
town
the
gentlemen
taking
their
meals
at
the
castle
at
the
same
time
as
the
baron
but
owing
to
lack
of
room
in
another
apartment
by
themselves
durand
was
placed
or
rather
quietly
helped
himself
to
a
seat
next
to
the
lady
aurora
and
of
all
the
men
there
present
certainly
there
was
none
more
gallant
and
noble
than
he
his
dark
eyes
his
curling
hair
short
but
brought
in
a
thick
curl
over
his
forehead
his
lips
well
shaped
his
chin
round
and
somewhat
prominent
the
slight
moustache
no
other
hair
on
the
face
formed
the
very
ideal
of
what
many
women
look
for
in
a
man
but
it
was
his
bright
lively
conversation
the
way
in
which
his
slightly
swarthy
complexion
flushed
with
animation
the
impudent
assurance
and
yet
generous
warmth
of
his
manner
and
indeed
of
his
feelings
which
had
given
him
the
merited
reputation
of
being
the
very
flower
of
the
nobles
with
such
a
reputation
backed
with
the
great
wealth
and
power
of
his
father
gentlemen
competed
with
each
other
to
swell
his
train
he
could
not
indeed
entertain
all
that
came
and
was
often
besieged
with
almost
as
large
a
crowd
as
the
prince
himself
he
took
as
his
right
the
chair
next
to
aurora
to
whom
indeed
he
had
been
paying
unremitting
attention
all
the
morning
she
was
laughing
heartily
as
she
sat
down
at
some
sally
of
his
upon
a
beauty
at
the
court
the
elder
men
were
placed
highest
up
the
tables
and
nearest
the
host
but
to
the
astonishment
of
all
and
not
the
least
of
himself
oliver
was
invited
by
the
baron
to
sit
by
his
side
oliver
could
not
understand
this
special
mark
of
favour
the
others
though
far
too
proud
for
a
moment
to
resent
what
they
might
have
deemed
a
slight
upon
them
at
once
began
to
search
their
minds
for
a
reason
they
knew
the
baron
as
an
old
intriguer
they
attached
a
meaning
whether
intended
or
not
to
his
smallest
action
felix
crowded
out
as
it
were
and
unnoticed
was
forced
to
take
his
seat
at
the
end
of
the
table
nearest
that
set
apart
in
the
corner
for
the
aged
and
honoured
servitors
of
the
family
only
a
few
feet
intervened
between
him
and
ancient
henchmen
and
he
could
not
but
overhear
their
talk
among
themselves
whispered
as
it
was
he
had
merely
shaken
hands
with
aurora
the
crowd
in
the
and
the
marked
attentions
of
durand
had
prevented
the
exchange
of
a
single
word
between
them
as
usual
the
sense
of
neglect
and
injury
over
which
he
had
so
long
brooded
with
little
or
no
real
cause
considering
of
course
his
position
and
that
the
world
can
only
see
our
coats
and
not
our
hearts
under
these
entirely
accidental
circumstances
rose
up
again
within
him
and
blinded
him
to
the
actual
state
of
things
his
seat
the
lowest
and
the
nearest
to
the
servitors
was
in
itself
a
mark
of
the
low
estimation
in
which
he
was
held
the
lord
durand
had
been
placed
next
to
aurora
as
a
direct
encouragement
to
him
and
a
direct
hint
to
himself
not
to
presume
doubtless
durand
had
been
at
the
castle
many
times
not
improbably
already
been
accepted
by
the
baron
and
not
altogether
refused
by
aurora
as
a
fact
though
delighted
with
her
beauty
and
conversation
durand
presence
was
entirely
due
to
the
will
of
his
father
the
earl
who
wished
to
maintain
friendly
relations
with
baron
thyma
and
even
then
he
would
not
have
come
had
not
the
lovely
weather
invited
him
to
ride
into
the
forest
it
was
however
so
far
true
that
though
his
presence
was
accidental
yet
he
was
fast
becoming
fascinated
by
one
who
girl
though
she
was
was
stronger
in
mind
than
he
now
aurora
knowing
that
he
father
eye
was
on
her
dared
not
look
towards
felix
lest
by
an
open
and
pronounced
conduct
she
should
be
the
cause
of
his
being
informed
that
his
presence
was
not
desirable
she
knew
that
the
baron
only
needed
a
pretext
to
interfere
and
was
anxious
to
avoid
offering
him
a
chance
felix
seeing
her
glance
bent
downwards
or
towards
her
companion
and
never
all
the
time
turned
to
him
not
unnaturally
but
too
hastily
concluded
that
she
had
been
dazzled
by
durand
and
the
possibility
of
an
alliance
with
his
powerful
family
he
was
discarded
worthless
and
of
no
account
he
had
nothing
but
his
sword
nay
he
had
not
a
sword
he
was
only
an
archer
a
footman
angry
jealous
and
burning
with
inward
annoyance
despising
himself
since
all
others
despised
him
scarce
able
to
remain
at
the
table
felix
was
almost
beside
himself
and
did
not
answer
nor
heed
the
remarks
of
the
gentlemen
sitting
by
him
who
put
him
down
as
an
churl
for
the
form
sake
indeed
he
put
his
lips
to
the
cup
of
fine
ale
which
continually
circulated
round
the
table
and
was
never
allowed
to
be
put
down
one
servant
had
nothing
else
to
do
but
to
see
that
its
progress
never
stopped
but
he
drank
nothing
and
ate
nothing
he
could
not
swallow
how
visionary
how
weak
and
feeble
now
seemed
the
wild
scheme
of
the
canoe
and
his
proposed
voyage
even
should
it
succeed
years
must
elapse
before
he
could
accomplish
anything
substantial
while
here
were
men
who
really
had
what
he
could
only
think
of
or
imagine
the
silver
chain
or
of
durand
the
sword
and
the
dagger
were
not
worn
at
the
banquet
nor
in
the
house
they
were
received
by
the
marshal
and
deposited
in
his
care
a
precaution
against
quarrelling
solid
silver
links
passing
over
his
shoulder
were
real
actual
things
all
the
magnificence
that
he
could
call
up
by
the
exercise
of
his
imagination
was
but
imagination
a
dream
no
more
to
be
seen
by
others
than
the
air
itself
the
dinner
went
on
and
the
talk
became
more
noisy
the
trout
the
chicken
the
thyme
lamb
trapped
on
the
hills
by
the
shepherds
the
plover
eggs
the
sirloin
the
pastry
the
baroness
superintended
the
making
of
it
herself
all
the
profusion
of
the
table
rather
set
him
against
food
than
tempted
him
nor
could
he
drink
the
tiny
drop
as
it
were
of
ancient
brandy
sent
round
to
each
guest
at
the
conclusion
precious
as
liquid
gold
for
it
had
been
handed
down
from
the
ancients
and
when
once
the
cask
was
empty
it
could
not
be
the
dessert
the
strawberries
the
nuts
and
walnuts
carefully
preserved
with
a
little
salt
and
shaken
in
the
basket
from
time
to
time
that
they
might
not
become
mouldy
the
apples
the
honey
in
the
comb
with
slices
of
white
bread
nothing
pleased
him
nor
did
he
drink
otherwise
than
the
sip
demanded
by
courtesy
of
the
thin
wine
of
gloucester
costly
as
it
was
grown
in
the
vineyard
there
and
shipped
across
the
lake
and
rendered
still
more
expensive
by
risk
of
pirates
this
was
poured
into
flagons
of
maple
wood
which
like
the
earthenware
cup
of
ale
were
never
allowed
to
touch
the
board
till
the
dinner
was
over
wearily
the
time
went
on
felix
glanced
more
and
more
often
at
the
sky
seen
through
the
casement
eagerly
desiring
to
escape
and
at
least
to
be
alone
at
last
how
long
it
seemed
the
baron
rose
and
immediately
the
rest
did
the
same
and
they
drank
the
health
of
the
prince
then
a
servitor
brought
in
a
pile
of
cigars
upon
a
carved
wooden
tray
like
a
large
platter
but
with
a
rim
these
said
the
baron
again
rising
the
signal
to
all
to
cease
conversing
and
to
listen
are
a
present
from
my
gracious
and
noble
friend
the
earl
of
essiton
he
looked
towards
durand
not
less
kindly
carried
by
lord
durand
i
could
have
provided
only
our
own
coarse
tobacco
but
these
are
the
best
devon
the
ladies
now
left
the
table
aurora
escorted
by
durand
the
baroness
by
oliver
oliver
indeed
was
in
the
highest
spirits
he
had
eaten
heartily
of
all
especially
the
sweet
thyme
lamb
and
drunk
as
freely
he
was
in
his
element
his
laugh
the
loudest
his
talk
the
liveliest
directly
durand
returned
he
had
gone
even
a
part
of
the
way
upstairs
towards
the
with
aurora
a
thing
a
little
against
etiquette
he
took
his
chair
formality
being
now
at
an
end
and
placed
it
by
oliver
they
seemed
to
become
friends
at
once
by
sympathy
of
mind
and
taste
round
them
the
rest
gradually
grouped
themselves
so
that
presently
felix
who
did
not
move
found
himself
sitting
alone
at
the
extreme
end
of
the
table
quite
apart
for
the
old
retainers
who
dined
at
the
separate
table
had
quitted
the
apartment
when
the
wine
was
brought
in
freed
from
the
restraint
of
the
ladies
the
talk
now
became
extremely
noisy
the
blue
smoke
from
the
long
cigars
filled
the
great
apartment
one
only
remained
untouched
that
placed
before
felix
suddenly
it
struck
him
that
thus
sitting
alone
and
apart
he
should
attract
attention
he
therefore
drew
his
chair
to
the
verge
of
the
group
but
remained
silent
and
as
far
off
as
ever
presently
the
arrival
of
five
more
guests
caused
a
stir
and
confusion
in
the
midst
of
which
he
escaped
into
the
open
air
he
wandered
towards
the
gate
of
the
wall
passing
the
wooden
shed
where
the
clink
of
hammers
resounded
glanced
at
the
sundial
which
showed
the
hour
of
three
three
weary
hours
had
they
feasted
and
went
out
into
the
gardens
still
going
on
he
descended
the
slope
and
not
much
heeding
whither
he
was
going
took
the
road
that
led
into
town
it
consisted
of
some
hundred
or
more
houses
built
of
wood
and
thatched
placed
without
plan
or
arrangement
on
the
bank
of
the
stream
only
one
long
street
ran
through
it
the
rest
were
mere
all
these
were
inhabited
by
the
baron
retainers
but
the
number
and
apparently
small
extent
of
the
houses
did
not
afford
correct
data
for
the
actual
amount
of
the
population
in
these
days
the
people
as
is
well
known
find
much
difficulty
in
marrying
it
seems
only
possible
for
a
certain
proportion
to
marry
and
hence
there
are
always
a
great
number
of
young
or
single
men
out
of
all
ratio
to
the
houses
at
the
sound
of
the
bugle
the
baron
could
reckon
on
at
least
three
hundred
men
flocking
without
a
minute
delay
to
man
the
wall
in
an
hour
more
would
arrive
from
the
outer
places
and
by
nightfall
if
the
summons
went
forth
in
the
morning
his
shepherds
and
swineherds
would
arrive
and
these
together
would
add
some
hundred
and
fifty
to
the
garrison
next
must
be
reckoned
the
armed
servants
of
the
house
the
personal
attendants
the
gentlemen
who
formed
his
train
his
sons
and
the
male
relations
of
the
family
these
certainly
were
not
less
than
fifty
altogether
over
five
hundred
men
well
armed
and
accustomed
to
the
use
of
their
weapons
would
range
themselves
beneath
his
banner
two
of
the
buildings
in
he
town
were
of
brick
the
material
carried
hither
for
there
was
no
clay
or
stone
thereabouts
they
were
not
far
apart
the
one
was
the
toll
house
where
all
merchants
or
traders
paid
the
charges
in
corn
or
kind
due
to
the
baron
the
other
was
the
court
house
where
he
sat
to
administer
justice
and
decide
causes
or
to
send
the
criminal
to
the
gibbet
these
alone
of
the
buildings
were
of
any
age
for
the
wooden
houses
were
extremely
subject
to
destruction
by
fire
and
twice
in
the
baron
time
half
the
town
had
been
laid
in
ashes
only
to
rise
again
in
a
few
weeks
timber
was
so
abundant
and
so
ready
of
access
it
seemed
a
loss
of
labour
to
fetch
stone
or
brick
or
to
use
the
flints
of
the
hills
about
the
doors
of
the
two
inns
there
were
gathered
groups
of
people
among
them
the
liveries
of
the
nobles
visiting
the
castle
were
conspicuous
the
place
was
full
of
them
the
stables
were
filled
and
their
horses
were
picketed
under
the
trees
and
even
in
the
street
every
minute
the
numbers
increased
as
others
arrived
men
too
who
had
obtained
permission
of
their
lords
came
in
on
foot
ten
or
twelve
travelling
together
for
mutual
protection
for
the
feuds
of
their
masters
exposed
them
to
frequent
attack
all
except
the
nobles
were
disarmed
at
the
barrier
by
the
warden
and
guard
that
peace
might
be
preserved
in
the
enclosure
the
folk
at
the
moment
he
passed
were
watching
the
descent
of
three
covered
waggons
from
the
forest
track
in
which
were
travelling
the
ladies
of
as
many
noble
families
some
indeed
of
the
youngest
and
boldest
ride
on
horseback
but
the
ladies
chiefly
move
in
these
waggons
which
are
fitted
up
with
considerable
comfort
and
are
necessary
to
sleep
in
when
the
camp
is
formed
by
the
wayside
at
night
none
noticed
him
as
he
went
by
except
a
group
of
three
cottage
girls
and
a
an
attendant
of
a
lady
visitor
at
the
castle
he
heard
them
allude
to
him
he
quickened
his
pace
but
heard
one
say
he
nobody
he
has
even
got
a
horse
yes
he
is
replied
the
he
oliver
brother
and
i
can
tell
you
my
lord
oliver
is
somebody
the
princess
lucia
and
she
made
the
motion
of
kissing
with
her
lips
felix
ashamed
and
annoyed
to
the
last
degree
stepped
rapidly
from
the
spot
the
however
was
right
in
a
measure
the
real
or
supposed
favour
shown
oliver
by
the
prince
sister
the
duchess
of
deverell
had
begun
to
be
bruited
abroad
and
this
was
the
secret
reason
why
the
baron
had
shown
oliver
so
much
and
so
marked
an
attention
even
more
than
he
had
paid
to
lord
durand
full
well
he
knew
the
extraordinary
influence
possessed
by
ladies
of
rank
and
position
from
what
we
can
learn
out
of
the
scanty
records
of
the
past
it
was
so
even
in
the
days
of
the
ancients
it
is
a
hundredfold
more
so
in
these
times
when
although
every
noble
must
of
necessity
be
taught
to
read
and
write
as
a
matter
of
fact
the
men
do
neither
but
all
the
correspondence
of
kings
and
princes
and
the
diplomatic
documents
and
notices
and
so
forth
are
one
and
all
almost
without
a
single
exception
drawn
up
by
women
they
know
the
secret
and
hidden
motives
of
courts
and
have
this
great
advantage
that
they
can
use
their
knowledge
without
personal
fear
since
women
are
never
seriously
interfered
with
but
are
protected
by
all
the
one
terrible
and
utterly
shameful
instance
to
the
contrary
had
not
occurred
at
the
time
of
which
we
are
now
speaking
and
it
was
and
is
still
repudiated
by
every
man
from
the
knight
to
the
boys
who
gather
acorns
for
the
swine
oliver
himself
had
no
idea
whatever
that
he
was
regarded
as
a
favourite
lover
of
the
duchess
he
took
the
welcome
that
was
held
out
to
him
as
perfectly
honest
plain
straightforward
and
honest
oliver
had
he
been
openly
singled
out
by
a
queen
would
have
scorned
to
give
himself
an
air
for
such
a
reason
but
the
baron
deep
in
intrigue
this
many
a
year
looked
more
profoundly
into
the
possibilities
of
the
future
when
he
kept
the
young
knight
at
his
side
chapter
ix
superstitions
felix
was
now
outside
the
town
and
alone
in
the
meadow
which
bordered
the
stream
he
knelt
and
drank
from
it
with
the
hollow
of
his
hand
he
was
going
to
ascend
the
hill
beyond
and
had
already
reached
the
barrier
upon
that
side
when
he
recollected
that
etiquette
demanded
the
presence
of
the
guests
at
and
it
was
now
the
hour
for
tea
he
hastened
back
and
found
the
courtyard
of
the
castle
crowded
within
the
staircase
leading
to
the
baroness
chamber
where
tea
was
served
could
scarcely
be
ascended
what
with
the
ladies
and
their
courtiers
the
long
trains
of
the
the
pages
winding
their
way
in
and
out
the
servants
endeavouring
to
pass
the
slender
pet
greyhounds
the
inseparable
companions
of
their
mistresses
by
degrees
and
exercising
patience
he
gained
the
upper
floor
and
entered
the
the
baroness
alone
sat
at
the
table
the
guests
wheresoever
they
chose
or
chance
carried
them
for
the
most
part
they
stood
or
leaned
against
the
recess
of
the
open
window
of
tea
itself
there
was
none
there
had
been
no
tea
to
be
had
for
love
or
money
these
fifty
years
past
and
indeed
its
use
would
have
been
forgotten
and
the
name
only
survived
had
not
some
small
quantities
been
yet
preserved
and
brought
out
on
rare
occasions
at
the
palaces
instead
there
was
chicory
prepared
from
the
root
of
the
plant
grown
for
the
purpose
fresh
milk
fine
ale
and
mead
and
wine
from
gloucester
butter
honey
and
cake
were
also
on
the
table
the
guests
helped
themselves
or
waited
till
the
servants
came
to
them
with
wooden
carved
trays
the
particular
characteristic
of
tea
is
the
freedom
from
restraint
it
is
not
considered
necessary
to
sit
as
at
dinner
or
supper
nor
to
do
as
others
do
each
pleases
himself
and
there
is
no
ceremony
yet
although
so
near
aurora
felix
did
not
succeed
in
speaking
to
her
durand
still
engaged
her
attention
whenever
other
ladies
were
not
talking
with
her
felix
found
himself
exactly
as
at
quite
outside
the
circle
there
was
a
buzz
of
conversation
around
but
not
a
word
of
it
was
addressed
to
him
dresses
brushed
against
him
but
the
fair
owners
were
not
concerned
even
to
acknowledge
his
existence
pushed
by
the
jostling
crowd
aside
from
the
centre
of
the
floor
felix
presently
sat
down
glad
to
rest
at
last
behind
the
open
door
forgotten
he
forgot
and
looking
as
it
were
out
of
the
present
in
a
bitter
reverie
scarcely
knew
where
he
was
except
at
moments
when
he
heard
the
and
loved
voice
of
aurora
a
servant
after
a
while
came
to
him
with
a
tray
he
took
some
honey
and
bread
almost
immediately
afterwards
another
servant
came
and
presented
him
with
a
plate
on
which
was
a
cup
of
wine
saying
with
my
lady
loving
wishes
as
in
duty
bound
he
rose
and
bowed
to
the
baroness
she
smiled
and
nodded
the
circle
which
had
looked
to
see
who
was
thus
honoured
turned
aside
again
not
recognising
him
to
send
a
guest
a
plate
with
wine
or
food
is
the
highest
mark
of
esteem
and
this
plate
in
especial
was
of
almost
priceless
value
as
felix
saw
when
his
confusion
had
abated
it
was
of
the
ancient
china
now
not
to
be
found
in
even
the
houses
of
the
great
in
all
that
kingdom
but
five
perfect
plates
were
known
to
exist
and
two
of
these
were
at
the
palace
they
are
treasured
as
heirlooms
and
if
ever
broken
can
never
be
replaced
the
very
fragments
are
rare
they
are
often
set
in
panels
and
highly
prized
the
baroness
glancing
round
her
court
had
noticed
at
last
the
young
man
sitting
in
the
obscure
corner
behind
the
door
she
remembered
not
without
some
twinge
of
conscience
that
his
house
was
their
ancient
ally
and
sworn
she
knew
far
better
than
the
baron
how
deeply
her
daughter
loved
him
better
perhaps
even
than
aurora
herself
she
too
naturally
hoped
a
higher
alliance
for
aurora
yet
she
was
a
true
woman
and
her
heart
was
stronger
than
her
ambition
the
trifle
of
the
wine
was
of
course
nothing
but
it
was
open
and
marked
recognition
she
expected
that
felix
after
his
wont
in
former
times
before
love
or
marriage
was
thought
of
for
aurora
would
have
come
upon
this
distinct
invitation
and
taken
his
stand
behind
her
after
the
custom
but
as
he
did
not
come
fresh
guests
and
the
duties
of
hospitality
distracted
her
attention
and
she
again
forgot
him
he
was
indeed
more
hurt
than
pleased
with
the
favour
that
had
been
shown
him
it
seemed
to
him
though
really
prompted
by
the
kindest
feeling
like
a
bone
cast
at
a
dog
he
desired
to
be
so
regarded
that
no
special
mark
of
favour
should
be
needed
it
simply
increased
his
discontent
the
evening
wore
on
the
supper
began
how
weary
it
seemed
to
him
that
long
and
jovial
supper
with
the
ale
that
ran
in
a
continual
stream
the
wine
that
ceaselessly
circled
round
the
jokes
and
bustle
and
laughter
the
welcome
to
guests
arriving
the
cards
and
chess
and
games
that
succeeded
it
the
drinking
and
drinking
and
drinking
till
the
ladies
again
left
then
drinking
yet
more
freely
he
slipped
away
at
the
first
opportunity
and
having
first
strolled
to
and
fro
on
the
bowling
green
wet
with
dew
at
the
rear
of
the
castle
asked
for
his
bedroom
it
was
some
time
before
he
could
get
attended
to
he
stood
alone
at
the
foot
of
the
staircase
while
others
went
first
their
small
coins
bought
them
attention
till
at
last
a
lamp
was
brought
to
him
and
his
chamber
named
this
chamber
such
as
it
was
was
the
only
pleasure
and
that
a
melancholy
one
he
had
had
that
day
though
overflowing
with
guests
so
that
the
most
honoured
visitors
could
not
be
accommodated
within
the
castle
and
only
the
ladies
could
find
sleeping
room
there
yet
the
sacred
law
of
honour
the
pledge
of
the
passed
three
generations
ago
secured
him
this
privilege
the
must
sleep
within
if
a
king
were
sent
without
oliver
of
course
would
occupy
the
same
room
but
he
was
drinking
and
shouting
a
song
below
so
that
for
a
while
felix
had
the
chamber
to
himself
it
pleased
him
because
it
was
the
room
in
which
he
had
always
slept
when
he
visited
the
place
from
a
boy
when
half
afraid
and
yet
determined
to
venture
he
had
first
come
through
the
lonely
forest
alone
how
well
he
remembered
that
first
time
the
autumn
sunshine
on
the
stubble
at
old
house
and
the
red
and
brown
leaves
of
the
forest
as
he
entered
how
he
entered
on
foot
and
twice
turned
back
and
twice
adventured
again
till
he
got
so
deep
into
the
forest
that
it
seemed
as
far
to
return
as
to
advance
how
he
started
at
the
sudden
bellow
of
two
stags
and
the
clatter
of
their
horns
as
they
fought
in
the
brake
close
by
and
how
beautiful
the
castle
looked
when
presently
he
emerged
from
the
bushes
and
looked
down
upon
it
this
was
the
very
room
he
slept
in
the
baroness
came
to
see
that
he
was
comfortable
here
he
had
slept
every
time
since
here
he
had
listened
in
the
early
morning
for
aurora
footfall
as
she
passed
his
door
for
the
ladies
rose
earlier
than
did
the
men
he
now
sat
down
by
the
open
window
it
was
a
brilliant
moonlight
night
warm
and
delicious
and
the
note
of
the
nightingale
came
across
the
gardens
from
the
hawthorn
bushes
without
the
inner
stockade
to
the
left
he
could
see
the
line
of
the
hills
to
the
right
the
forest
all
was
quiet
there
but
every
now
and
then
the
sound
of
a
ballad
came
round
the
castle
a
sound
without
recognizable
words
inarticulate
merriment
if
he
started
upon
the
hazardous
voyage
he
contemplated
and
for
which
he
had
been
so
long
preparing
should
he
ever
sleep
there
again
so
near
the
one
he
loved
was
it
not
better
to
be
poor
and
despised
but
near
her
than
to
attempt
such
an
expedition
especially
as
the
chances
as
his
common
sense
told
him
were
all
against
him
yet
he
could
not
stay
he
do
it
and
he
tried
to
stifle
the
doubt
which
insisted
upon
arising
in
his
mind
then
he
recurred
to
durand
he
remembered
that
not
once
on
that
day
had
he
exchanged
one
single
word
beyond
the
first
and
ordinary
salutation
with
aurora
might
she
not
had
she
chosen
have
arranged
a
moment
interview
might
she
not
easily
have
given
him
an
opportunity
was
it
not
clear
that
she
was
ashamed
of
her
girlish
fancy
for
a
portionless
and
despised
youth
if
so
was
it
worth
while
to
go
upon
so
strange
an
enterprise
for
her
sake
but
if
so
also
was
life
worth
living
and
might
he
not
as
well
go
and
seek
destruction
while
this
conflict
of
feeling
was
proceeding
he
chanced
to
look
towards
the
table
upon
which
he
had
carelessly
placed
his
lamp
and
observed
what
in
his
agitated
state
of
mind
he
had
previously
overlooked
a
small
roll
of
manuscript
tied
round
with
silk
curious
in
books
he
undid
the
fastening
and
opened
the
volume
there
was
not
much
writing
but
many
singular
diagrams
and
signs
arranged
in
circles
it
was
in
fact
a
book
of
magic
written
at
the
dictation
as
the
preface
stated
of
one
who
had
been
for
seven
years
a
slave
among
the
romany
he
had
been
captured
and
forced
to
work
for
the
tent
to
which
his
owners
belonged
he
had
witnessed
their
worship
and
their
sorceries
he
had
seen
the
sacrifice
to
the
full
moon
their
chief
goddess
and
the
wild
extravagances
with
which
it
was
accompanied
he
had
learnt
some
few
of
their
signs
and
upon
escaping
had
reproduced
them
from
memory
some
were
engraved
on
the
stones
set
in
their
rings
some
were
carved
on
wooden
tablets
some
drawn
with
ink
on
parchment
but
with
all
their
procedure
seemed
to
be
the
repetition
of
certain
verses
and
then
a
steady
gaze
upon
the
picture
presently
they
became
filled
with
rapture
uttered
what
sounded
as
the
wildest
ravings
and
their
women
especially
prophesied
of
the
future
a
few
of
the
signs
he
understood
the
meaning
of
but
the
others
he
owned
were
unknown
to
him
at
the
end
of
the
book
were
several
pages
of
commentary
describing
the
demons
believed
in
and
worshipped
by
the
romany
demons
which
haunted
the
woods
and
hills
and
against
which
it
was
best
to
be
provided
with
amulets
blessed
by
the
holy
fathers
of
augustine
such
demons
stole
on
the
hunter
at
noonday
and
alarmed
at
the
sudden
appearance
upon
turning
his
head
for
demons
invariably
approach
from
behind
and
their
presence
is
indicated
by
a
shudder
in
the
back
he
toppled
into
pits
hidden
by
fern
and
was
killed
or
in
the
shape
of
a
dog
they
ran
between
the
traveller
legs
or
as
woman
with
tempting
caresses
lured
him
from
the
way
at
nightfall
into
the
leafy
recesses
and
then
instantaneously
changing
into
vast
forms
fastened
on
his
throat
and
sucked
his
blood
the
terrible
screams
of
such
victims
had
often
been
heard
by
the
warders
at
the
outposts
some
were
invisible
and
yet
slew
the
unwary
by
descending
unseen
upon
him
and
choking
him
with
a
pressure
as
if
the
air
had
suddenly
become
heavy
but
none
of
these
were
perhaps
so
much
to
be
dreaded
as
the
and
graceful
ladies
of
the
fern
these
were
creatures
not
of
flesh
and
blood
and
yet
not
incorporeal
like
the
demons
nor
were
they
dangerous
to
the
physical
man
doing
no
bodily
injury
the
harm
they
did
was
by
fascinating
the
soul
so
that
it
revolted
from
all
religion
and
all
the
rites
of
the
church
once
resigned
to
the
caress
of
the
the
unfortunate
was
lured
farther
and
farther
from
the
haunts
of
men
until
at
last
he
wandered
into
the
unknown
forest
and
was
never
seen
again
these
creatures
were
usually
found
among
the
brake
fern
nude
but
the
lower
limbs
and
body
hidden
by
the
green
fronds
their
white
arms
and
shoulders
alone
visible
and
their
golden
hair
aglow
with
the
summer
sunshine
demons
there
were
too
of
the
streams
and
demons
dwelling
in
the
midst
of
the
hills
demons
that
could
travel
only
in
the
moonbeams
and
others
that
floated
before
the
stormy
winds
and
hurled
the
wretched
wanderer
to
destruction
or
crushed
him
with
the
overthrown
trees
in
proof
of
this
the
monk
asked
the
reader
if
he
had
not
heard
of
huge
boughs
falling
from
trees
without
visible
cause
suddenly
and
without
warning
and
even
of
trees
themselves
in
full
foliage
in
calm
weather
toppling
with
a
crash
to
the
imminent
danger
or
the
death
of
those
who
happened
to
be
passing
let
all
these
purchase
the
amulets
of
augustine
concluded
the
writer
who
it
appeared
was
a
monk
in
whose
monastery
the
escaped
prisoner
had
taken
refuge
and
who
had
written
down
his
relation
and
copied
his
rude
sketches
felix
pored
over
the
strange
diagrams
striving
to
understand
the
hidden
meaning
some
of
them
he
thought
were
alchemical
signs
and
related
to
the
making
of
gold
especially
as
the
prisoner
stated
the
romany
possessed
much
more
of
that
metal
in
the
tents
than
he
had
seen
in
the
palaces
of
our
kings
whether
they
had
a
gold
mine
from
whence
they
drew
it
or
whether
they
had
the
art
of
transmutation
he
knew
not
but
he
had
heard
allusions
to
the
wealth
in
the
mountain
of
the
apple
trees
which
he
supposed
to
be
a
mystical
phrase
when
felix
at
last
looked
up
the
lamp
was
low
the
moonbeams
had
entered
and
fell
upon
the
polished
floor
and
from
the
window
he
could
see
a
long
white
ghostly
line
of
mist
where
a
streamlet
ran
at
the
base
of
the
slope
by
the
forest
the
songs
were
silent
there
was
no
sound
save
the
distant
neigh
of
a
horse
and
the
heavy
tramp
of
a
guest
coming
along
the
gallery
half
bewildered
by
poring
over
the
magic
scroll
full
of
the
signs
and
the
demons
and
still
with
a
sense
of
injury
and
jealousy
cankering
his
heart
felix
retired
to
his
couch
and
weary
beyond
measure
instantly
fell
asleep
in
his
unsettled
state
of
mind
it
did
not
once
occur
to
him
to
ask
himself
how
the
manuscript
came
to
be
upon
his
table
rare
as
they
were
books
were
not
usually
put
upon
the
tables
of
guests
and
at
an
ordinary
time
he
would
certainly
have
thought
it
peculiar
the
fact
was
that
aurora
whom
all
day
he
had
inwardly
accused
of
forgetting
him
had
placed
it
there
for
him
with
her
own
hands
she
too
was
curious
in
books
and
fond
of
study
she
had
very
recently
bought
the
volume
from
a
merchant
who
had
come
thus
far
and
who
valued
it
the
least
of
all
his
wares
she
knew
that
felix
had
read
and
every
other
scrap
of
writing
there
was
in
the
castle
and
thought
that
this
strange
book
might
interest
him
giving
as
it
did
details
of
those
powers
of
the
air
in
which
almost
all
fully
believed
unconscious
of
this
attention
felix
fell
asleep
angry
and
bitter
against
her
when
half
an
hour
afterwards
oliver
blundered
into
the
room
a
little
unsteady
on
his
legs
notwithstanding
his
mighty
strength
he
picked
up
the
roll
glanced
at
it
flung
it
down
with
contempt
and
without
a
minute
delay
sought
and
obtained
slumber
chapter
x
the
feast
at
ten
in
the
morning
next
day
the
feast
began
with
a
drama
from
sophocles
which
was
performed
in
the
open
air
the
theatre
was
in
the
gardens
between
the
wall
and
the
inner
stockade
the
spectators
sat
on
the
slope
tier
above
tier
the
actors
appeared
upon
a
green
terrace
below
issuing
from
an
arbour
and
passing
off
behind
a
thick
on
the
other
side
of
the
terrace
there
was
no
scenery
whatever
aurora
had
selected
the
antigone
there
were
not
many
dramatists
from
whom
to
choose
for
so
many
english
writers
once
famous
had
dropped
out
of
knowledge
and
disappeared
yet
some
of
the
far
more
ancient
greek
and
roman
classics
remained
because
they
contained
depth
and
originality
of
ideas
in
small
compass
they
had
been
copied
in
manuscripts
by
thoughtful
men
from
the
old
printed
books
before
they
mouldered
away
and
their
manuscripts
being
copied
again
these
works
were
handed
down
the
books
which
came
into
existence
with
printing
had
never
been
copied
by
the
pen
and
had
consequently
nearly
disappeared
extremely
long
and
diffuse
it
was
found
too
that
so
many
of
them
were
but
enlargements
of
ideas
or
sentiments
which
had
been
expressed
in
a
few
words
by
the
classics
it
is
so
much
easier
to
copy
an
epigram
of
two
lines
than
a
printed
book
of
hundreds
of
pages
and
hence
it
was
that
sophocles
had
survived
while
much
more
recent
writers
had
been
lost
from
a
translation
aurora
had
arranged
several
of
his
dramas
antigone
was
her
favourite
and
she
wished
felix
to
see
it
in
some
indefinable
manner
the
spirit
of
the
ancient
greeks
seemed
to
her
in
accord
with
the
times
for
men
had
or
appeared
to
have
so
little
control
over
their
own
lives
that
they
might
well
imagine
themselves
overruled
by
destiny
communication
between
one
place
and
another
was
difficult
the
division
of
society
into
castes
and
the
iron
tyranny
of
arms
prevented
the
individual
from
making
any
progress
in
lifting
himself
out
of
the
groove
in
which
he
was
born
except
by
the
rarest
opportunity
unless
specially
favoured
by
fortune
as
men
were
born
so
they
lived
they
could
not
advance
and
when
this
is
the
case
the
idea
of
fate
is
always
predominant
the
workings
of
destiny
the
irresistible
overpowering
both
the
good
and
the
such
as
were
traced
in
the
greek
drama
were
paralleled
in
the
lives
of
many
a
miserable
slave
at
that
day
they
were
forced
to
endure
for
there
was
no
possibility
of
effort
aurora
saw
this
and
felt
it
deeply
ever
anxious
as
she
was
for
the
good
of
all
she
saw
the
sadness
that
reigned
even
in
the
midst
of
the
fresh
foliage
of
spring
and
among
the
flowers
it
was
fate
it
was
sophocles
she
took
the
part
of
the
heroine
herself
clad
in
greek
costume
felix
listened
and
watched
absorbed
in
his
love
never
had
that
ancient
drama
appeared
so
beautiful
as
then
in
the
sunlight
the
actors
stepped
upon
the
daisied
sward
and
the
song
of
birds
was
all
their
music
while
the
play
was
still
proceeding
those
who
were
to
form
the
usual
procession
had
already
been
assembling
in
the
court
before
the
castle
and
just
after
noon
to
the
sound
of
the
trumpet
the
baron
with
his
youngest
son
beside
him
the
eldest
was
at
court
left
the
porch
wearing
his
short
mantle
his
collar
and
golden
spurs
and
the
decoration
won
so
many
years
before
all
the
insignia
of
his
rank
he
walked
his
fully
caparisoned
with
axe
at
the
was
led
at
his
right
side
and
upon
the
other
came
a
knight
carrying
the
banneret
of
the
house
the
gentlemen
of
the
house
followed
closely
duly
marshalled
in
ranks
and
wearing
the
gayest
dress
the
leading
retainers
fully
armed
brought
up
the
rear
immediately
upon
issuing
from
the
gate
of
the
wall
the
procession
was
met
and
surrounded
by
the
crowd
carrying
large
branches
of
may
in
bloom
flowers
and
green
willow
boughs
the
flowers
they
flung
before
him
on
the
ground
the
branches
they
bore
with
them
chanting
old
verses
in
honour
of
the
family
the
route
was
through
the
town
where
the
baron
stopped
at
the
door
of
the
court
house
and
proclaimed
a
free
pardon
to
all
serfs
who
were
released
within
a
few
minutes
not
guilty
of
the
heavier
crimes
thence
he
went
to
the
pasture
just
beyond
carefully
mown
close
and
swept
for
the
purpose
where
the
stood
wreathed
with
flowers
and
green
branches
beneath
it
he
deposited
a
bag
of
money
for
distribution
upon
a
carved
butt
placed
there
the
signal
that
the
games
were
open
instantly
the
fiddles
began
to
play
and
the
feast
really
commenced
at
the
inns
ale
was
served
out
freely
at
the
charge
carts
too
came
down
from
the
castle
laden
with
ale
and
cooked
provisions
wishing
them
joy
the
baron
returned
by
the
same
road
to
the
castle
where
dinner
was
already
served
in
the
hall
and
the
sheds
that
had
been
erected
to
enlarge
the
accommodation
in
the
afternoon
there
were
and
leaping
competitions
and
the
dances
about
the
were
prolonged
far
into
the
night
the
second
day
early
in
the
morning
the
barriers
were
opened
and
trials
of
skill
with
the
blunt
sword
jousting
with
the
blunt
lance
at
the
quintain
and
wrestling
began
and
continued
almost
till
sunset
tournament
with
sharpened
lance
or
sword
when
the
combatants
fight
with
risk
of
serious
wounds
can
take
place
only
in
the
presence
of
the
prince
or
his
deputy
but
in
these
conflicts
sufficiently
severe
blows
were
given
to
disable
the
competitors
on
the
third
day
there
was
a
set
battle
in
the
morning
between
fifteen
men
on
each
side
armed
with
the
usual
buckler
or
small
shield
and
stout
instead
of
swords
this
combat
excited
more
interest
than
all
the
duels
that
had
preceded
it
the
crowd
almost
broke
down
the
barriers
and
the
cheering
and
cries
of
encouragement
could
be
heard
upon
the
hills
thrice
the
combatants
rested
from
the
engagement
and
thrice
at
the
trumpet
call
started
again
to
meet
each
other
at
least
those
who
had
sustained
the
first
onslaught
blood
indeed
was
not
shed
for
the
iron
morions
saved
their
skulls
but
nearly
half
of
the
number
required
assistance
to
reach
the
tents
pitched
for
their
use
then
came
more
feasting
the
final
dinner
prolonged
till
six
in
the
evening
when
the
company
constantly
rising
from
their
seats
cheered
the
baron
and
drank
to
the
prosperity
of
the
house
after
the
horn
blew
at
six
the
guests
who
had
come
from
a
distance
rapidly
dispersed
their
horses
were
already
waiting
for
they
were
anxious
to
pass
the
fifteen
miles
of
forest
before
nightfall
those
on
foot
and
those
ladies
who
had
come
in
covered
waggons
stayed
till
next
morning
as
they
could
not
travel
so
speedily
by
seven
or
eight
the
castle
courtyard
was
comparatively
empty
and
the
baron
weary
from
the
mere
bodily
efforts
of
saying
farewell
to
so
many
had
flung
himself
at
full
length
on
a
couch
in
the
during
the
whole
of
this
time
felix
had
not
obtained
a
single
moment
with
aurora
her
time
when
not
occupied
in
attending
to
the
guests
was
always
claimed
by
lord
durand
felix
after
the
but
pure
pleasure
he
had
enjoyed
in
watching
her
upon
the
stage
had
endured
three
days
of
misery
he
was
among
the
crowd
he
was
in
the
castle
itself
he
sat
at
table
with
the
most
honoured
visitors
yet
he
was
distinct
from
all
there
was
no
sympathy
between
them
and
him
the
games
the
dancing
the
feasting
and
laughter
the
ceaseless
singing
and
shouting
and
jovial
jostling
jarred
upon
him
the
boundless
interest
the
people
took
in
the
combats
and
especially
that
of
the
thirty
seemed
to
him
a
strange
and
inexplicable
phenomenon
it
did
not
excite
him
in
the
least
he
could
turn
his
back
upon
it
without
hesitation
he
would
indeed
have
left
the
crowd
and
spent
the
day
in
the
forest
or
on
the
hills
but
he
could
not
leave
aurora
he
must
be
near
her
he
must
see
her
though
he
was
miserable
now
he
feared
that
the
last
moment
would
come
and
that
he
should
not
exchange
a
word
with
her
he
could
not
with
any
show
of
pretext
prolong
his
stay
beyond
the
sunset
all
were
already
gone
with
the
exceptions
mentioned
it
would
be
against
etiquette
to
remain
longer
unless
specially
invited
and
he
was
not
specially
invited
yet
he
lingered
and
lingered
his
horse
was
ready
below
the
groom
weary
of
holding
the
bridle
had
thrown
it
over
an
iron
hook
in
the
yard
and
gone
about
other
business
the
sun
perceptibly
declined
and
the
shadow
of
the
beeches
of
the
forest
began
to
descend
the
grassy
slope
still
he
stayed
restlessly
moving
now
in
the
dining
chamber
now
in
the
hall
now
at
the
foot
of
the
staircase
with
an
unpleasant
feeling
that
the
servants
looked
at
him
curiously
and
were
watching
him
oliver
had
gone
long
since
riding
with
his
new
friend
lord
durand
they
must
by
now
be
through
the
forest
forced
by
the
inexorable
flight
of
time
he
put
his
foot
upon
the
staircase
to
go
up
to
the
and
bid
farewell
to
the
baroness
he
ascended
it
step
by
step
as
a
condemned
person
goes
to
his
doom
he
stayed
to
look
out
of
the
open
windows
as
he
went
by
anything
to
excuse
delay
to
himself
he
reached
the
landing
at
last
and
had
taken
two
steps
towards
the
door
when
aurora
maid
who
had
been
waiting
there
an
hour
or
more
for
the
opportunity
brushed
past
him
and
whispered
the
rose
arbour
without
a
word
he
turned
hastened
down
the

ran
through
the

out
at
the
gate
and
entering
the
gardens
between
the
wall
and
the
inner
stockade
made
for
the
arbour
on
the
terrace
where
the
drama
had
been
enacted
aurora
was
not
there
but
as
he
looked
round
disappointed
she
came
from
the
filbert
walk
and
taking
his
arm
led
him
to
the
arbour
they
sat
down
without
a
word
in
a
moment
she
placed
her
head
upon
his
shoulder
he
did
not
respond
she
put
her
arm
how
warm
it
felt
about
his
neck
he
yielded
stiffly
and
ungraciously
to
the
pressure
she
drew
down
his
head
and
kissed
him
his
lips
touched
but
did
not
press
hers
they
met
but
did
not
join
in
his
sullen
and
angry
silence
he
would
not
look
she
drew
still
nearer
and
whispered
his
name
then
he
broke
out
he
pushed
her
away
his
petty
jealousy
and
injured
poured
out
upon
her
i
am

chapter
xi
aurora
felix
fell
on
the
seat
beside
her
burying
his
face
in
the
folds
of
her
dress
he
sobbed
not
with
tears
but
choking
passion
she
held
him
to
her
heart
as
if
he
had
been
a
child
stroking
his
hair
and
kissing
it
whispering
to
him
assuring
him
that
her
love
was
his
that
she
was
unchanged
she
told
him
that
it
was
not
her
fault
a
little
while
before
the
feast
the
baron
had
suddenly
broken
out
into
a
fit
of
temper
such
as
she
had
never
seen
him
indulge
in
previously
the
cause
was
pressure
put
upon
him
by
his
creditors
unpleasant
truths
had
escaped
him
amongst
the
rest
his
dislike
his
positive
disapproval
of
the
tacit
engagement
they
had
entered
into
he
declared
that
if
the
least
outward
sign
of
it
appeared
before
the
guests
that
were
expected
he
would
order
felix
to
leave
the
place
and
cancel
the
no
matter
what
the
consequence
it
was
clear
that
he
was
set
upon
a
wealthy
and
powerful
alliance
for
her
that
the
earl
was
either
coming
or
would
send
his
son
he
knew
and
he
knew
that
nothing
so
repels
a
possible
suitor
as
the
rumour
that
the
lady
has
a
previous
engagement
in
short
he
made
it
a
condition
of
presence
being
tolerated
at
all
that
aurora
should
carefully
abstain
from
showing
the
slightest
attention
to
him
that
she
should
ignore
his
existence
nor
could
she
prevent
durand
following
her
without
a
marked
refusal
to
listen
to
his
conversation
a
refusal
which
would
most
certainly
at
once
have
brought
about
the
dreaded
explosion
she
thought
it
better
under
the
circumstances
to
preserve
peace
lest
intercourse
between
her
and
felix
should
be
entirely
broken
off
for
ever
this
was
the
secret
history
of
the
apparent
indifference
and
neglect
which
had
so
deeply
hurt
him
the
explanation
accompanied
as
it
was
with
so
many
tender
expressions
and
caresses
soothed
him
he
returned
her
kisses
and
became
calmer
he
could
not
doubt
her
for
in
his
heart
he
had
suspected
something
of
the
kind
long
since
yet
it
was
not
so
much
the
explanation
itself
nor
even
the
love
she
poured
upon
him
as
the
mere
fact
of
her
presence
so
near
that
brought
him
to
himself
the
influence
of
her
steadfast
nature
of
her
clear
broad
straightforward
view
of
things
the
decision
of
her
character
the
high
unselfish
motives
which
animated
her
all
together
supplied
that
which
was
wanting
in
himself
his
indecision
his
too
impressionable
disposition
which
checked
and
stayed
the
force
of
his
talent
and
counteracted
the
determination
of
a
naturally
iron
will
these
as
it
were
were
relieved
in
a
word
with
her
he
became
himself
how
many
times
he
had
told
her
as
much
how
many
times
she
had
replied
that
it
was
not
herself
but
that
in
which
she
believed
that
was
the
real
cause
of
this
feeling
it
was
that
ancient
and
true
religion
the
religion
of
the
primitive
church
as
she
found
it
in
the
fragments
of
the
scriptures
that
had
come
down
from
the
ancients
aurora
had
learnt
this
faith
from
childhood
it
was
indeed
a
tradition
of
the
house
preserved
unbroken
these
hundred
years
in
the
midst
of
the
jarring
creeds
whose
disciples
threatened
and
destroyed
each
other
on
the
one
hand
the
gorgeous
rite
of
the
with
the
priests
and
the
monks
claimed
dominion
and
really
held
a
large
share
both
over
the
body
and
the
soul
on
the
other
the
leaguers
with
their
bold
harsh
and
flowerless
creed
were
equally
and
equally
bigoted
around
them
the
bushmen
wandered
without
a
god
the
romany
called
upon
the
full
moon
within
courts
and
cities
the
gay
and
the
learned
alike
mocked
at
all
faith
and
believed
in
gold
alone
cruelty
reigned
everywhere
mercy
except
in
the
name
of
honour
there
was
none
humanity
was
unknown
a
few
a
very
few
only
had
knowledge
of
or
held
to
the
leading
tenets
which
in
the
time
of
the
ancients
were
assented
to
by
everyone
such
as
the
duty
of
humanity
to
all
the
duty
of
saving
and
protecting
life
of
kindness
and
gentleness
these
few
with
their
pastors
simple
and
unassuming
had
no
power
or
influence
yet
they
existed
here
and
there
a
living
protest
against
the
lawlessness
and
brutality
of
the
time
among
these
the
house
of
thyma
had
in
former
days
been
conspicuous
but
of
late
years
the
barons
of
thyma
had
more
from
policy
than
from
aught
else
rather
ignored
their
ancestral
faith
leaning
towards
the
league
which
was
then
powerful
in
that
kingdom
to
have
acted
otherwise
would
have
been
to
exclude
himself
from
all
appointments
but
aurora
learning
the
old
faith
at
her
mother
knee
had
become
too
deeply
imbued
with
its
moral
beauty
to
consent
to
this
course
by
degrees
as
she
grew
up
it
became
in
her
a
passion
more
than
a
faith
a
passion
the
object
of
her
life
a
girl
indeed
can
do
but
little
in
our
iron
days
but
that
little
she
did
the
chapel
beside
the
castle
long
since
fallen
to
decay
was
at
her
earnest
request
repaired
a
pastor
came
and
remained
as
chaplain
and
services
of
the
simplest
kind
but
serious
and
full
of
meaning
took
place
twice
a
week
to
these
she
drew
as
many
as
possible
of
the
inhabitants
of
the
enclosure
some
even
came
from
afar
once
now
and
then
to
attend
them
correspondence
was
carried
on
with
the
remnant
of
the
faith
that
no
one
might
plead
ignorance
for
there
was
up
to
the
date
no
written
record
aurora
set
herself
the
task
of
reducing
the
traditions
which
had
been
handed
down
to
writing
when
the
manuscript
was
at
last
completed
it
occupied
her
months
to
transcribe
copies
of
it
for
circulation
and
she
still
continued
to
make
copies
which
were
sent
by
messengers
and
by
the
travelling
merchants
to
the
markets
and
even
across
the
sea
apart
from
its
intrinsically
elevating
character
the
mere
mental
labour
expended
on
this
work
had
undoubtedly
strengthened
a
naturally
fine
intellect
as
she
said
it
was
the
faith
the
hope
that
that
faith
would
one
day
be
recognised
which
gave
her
so
much
influence
over
others
upon
this
one
thing
only
they
differed
felix
did
not
oppose
did
not
even
argue
he
was
simply
untouched
it
was
not
that
he
believed
in
anything
else
nor
that
he
doubted
he
was
merely
indifferent
he
had
too
great
a
natural
aptitude
for
the
physical
sciences
and
too
clear
a
mind
to
accept
that
which
was
taught
by
the
one
or
the
other
of
the
two
chief
opposing
parties
nor
could
he
join
in
the
ridicule
and
derision
of
the
gay
courtiers
for
the
mystery
of
existence
had
impressed
him
deeply
while
wandering
alone
in
the
forest
but
he
stood
aloof
he
smiled
and
listened
unconvinced
like
the
wild
creatures
of
the
forest
he
had
no
ears
for
these
matters
he
loved
aurora
that
was
all
but
he
felt
the
influence
just
the
same
with
all
his
powers
of
mind
and
contempt
of
superstitions
in
others
he
could
not
at
times
shake
off
the
apprehensions
aroused
by
untoward
omens
as
when
he
stepped
upon
the
adder
in
the
woods
aurora
knew
nothing
of
such
things
her
faith
was
clear
and
bright
like
a
star
nothing
could
alarm
her
or
bring
uneasiness
of
mind
this
beautiful
calm
not
cold
but
glowing
with
hope
and
love
soothed
him
that
evening
with
her
hope
and
love
with
her
message
of
trust
she
almost
persuaded
him
he
almost
turned
to
what
she
had
so
long
taught
he
almost
repented
of
that
hardness
of
heart
that
unutterable
distance
as
it
were
between
him
and
other
men
which
lay
at
the
bottom
of
his
proposed
expedition
he
opened
his
lips
to
confess
to
her
his
purpose
and
had
he
done
so
assuredly
she
would
have
persuaded
him
from
it
but
in
the
very
act
of
speaking
he
hesitated
it
was
characteristic
of
him
to
do
so
whether
she
instinctively
felt
that
there
was
something
concealed
from
her
or
guessed
that
the
discontent
she
knew
he
had
so
long
endured
was
coming
to
a
point
or
feared
lest
what
she
had
told
him
might
drive
him
to
some
act
she
begged
him
with
all
the
power
of
her
love
to
do
nothing
hasty
or
in
despair
nothing
that
would
separate
them
he
threw
his
arms
around
her
he
pressed
her
closely
to
him
he
trembled
with
the
passion
and
the
struggle
within
him
my
lady
calls
for
you
mademoiselle
said
a
voice
it
was
maid
who
had
kept
watch
she
has
asked
for
you
some
time
since
someone
is
coming
into
the
garden
there
was
no
help
for
it
aurora
kissed
him
and
was
gone
before
he
could
come
to
himself
how
long
the
interview
had
lasted
time
flies
swiftly
in
such
sweet
intercourse
or
how
long
he
sat
there
after
she
left
he
could
not
tell
but
when
he
went
out
already
the
dusk
was
gathering
the
sun
had
gone
down
and
in
the
east
the
as
yet
pale
orb
of
the
moon
was
rising
over
the
hills
as
if
in
a
dream
he
walked
with
unsteady
steps
to
the
castle
stable
his
horse
had
been
put
back
and
the
grooms
suggested
to
him
that
it
was
better
not
to
attempt
the
forest
at
night
but
he
was
determined
he
gave
them
all
the
coin
he
had
about
him
it
was
not
much
but
more
than
they
had
expected
they
ran
beside
him
to
the
barrier
advising
him
as
they
ran
as
he
would
go
to
string
his
bow
and
loosen
an
arrow
in
the
girdle
and
above
all
not
to
loiter
or
let
his
horse
walk
but
to
keep
him
at
as
sharp
a
trot
as
he
could
the
fact
that
so
many
wealthy
persons
had
assembled
at
the
castle
for
the
feast
would
be
sure
to
be
known
to
the
banditti
the
outlaws
of
the
cities
and
the
escaped
serfs
they
were
certain
to
be
on
the
look
out
for
travellers
let
him
beware
his
ears
tingled
and
his
head
felt
hot
as
if
the
blood
had
rushed
into
it
it
was
the
violence
of
the
emotion
that
he
had
felt
as
he
rode
from
the
barrier
hearing
and
yet
without
conscious
knowledge
of
what
they
said
they
watched
him
up
the
slope
and
saw
him
disappear
from
sight
under
the
dark
beeches
of
the
forest
chapter
xii
night
in
the
forest
at
first
felix
rode
quickly
but
his
horse
stumbling
though
accustomed
to
the
woods
warned
him
to
be
more
careful
the
passage
of
so
many
horsemen
in
the
last
few
days
had
cut
up
and
destroyed
the
track
which
was
nothing
but
a
green
path
and
the
covered
waggons
had
of
course
assisted
in
rendering
it
rough
and
broken
he
therefore
rode
slowly
and
giving
his
horse
his
head
he
picked
his
way
of
his
own
accord
at
the
side
of
the
road
often
brushing
against
the
underwood
still
indeed
absorbed
by
the
feelings
which
had
almost
mastered
him
in
the
arbour
and
thinking
of
aurora
he
forgot
where
he
was
till
the
dismal
howling
of
deep
in
the
forest
woke
him
it
was
almost
pitch
dark
under
the
tall
beeches
the
highest
of
the
trees
preventing
the
beams
of
the
moon
from
illuminating
the
path
till
later
in
the
night
like
a
curtain
the
thick
foliage
above
shut
out
the
sky
so
that
no
star
was
visible
when
the
ceased
there
was
no
sound
beyond
the
light
fall
of
the
horse
hoofs
as
he
walked
upon
the
grass
darkness
and
silence
prevailed
he
could
see
nothing
he
spoke
to
his
horse
and
patted
his
neck
he
stepped
a
little
faster
and
lifted
his
head
which
he
had
held
low
as
if
making
his
way
by
scent
the
gloom
weighed
upon
him
unhappy
as
he
was
often
as
he
had
voluntarily
sought
the
loneliness
of
the
woods
now
in
this
state
of
mind
it
oppressed
him
he
remembered
that
beyond
the
beeches
the
ground
was
open
and
cleared
by
a
forest
fire
and
began
to
be
anxious
to
reach
it
it
seemed
an
hour
but
it
really
was
only
a
few
minutes
when
the
beeches
became
thinner
and
wider
apart
the
foliage
above
ceased
and
the
stars
shone
before
him
was
the
open
space
he
had
desired
sloping
to
the
right
hand
the
tall
grass
in
the
moonlight
and
near
at
hand
sparkling
with
dew
amongst
it
stood
the
crooked
and
charred
stems
of
furze
with
which
it
had
been
covered
before
the
fire
passed
a
white
owl
floated
rather
than
flew
by
following
the
edge
of
the
forest
from
far
down
the
slope
came
the
chattering
notes
of
a
showing
that
there
was
water
in
the
hollow
some
large
animal
moved
into
the
white
mist
that
hung
there
and
immediately
concealed
it
like
a
cloud
upon
the
ground
he
was
not
certain
in
the
dim
light
and
with
so
momentary
and
distant
a
view
but
supposed
from
its
size
that
it
must
have
been
a
white
or
dun
ahead
across
the
open
rose
the
dark
top
of
the
fir
trees
through
which
the
route
ran
instead
of
the
relief
which
he
had
anticipated
as
he
rode
towards
them
the
space
clear
of
trees
around
seemed
to
expose
him
to
the
full
view
of
all
that
might
be
lurking
in
the
forest
as
he
approached
the
firs
and
saw
how
dark
it
was
beneath
them
the
shadowy
depths
suggested
uncertain
shapes
hiding
therein
and
his
memory
immediately
reverted
to
the
book
of
magic
he
had
read
at
the
castle
there
could
not
be
such
things
and
yet
no
one
in
his
heart
doubted
their
existence
deny
it
as
they
might
with
their
tongues
as
they
sat
at
the
and
handed
round
the
ale
out
of
doors
in
the
night
the
haste
to
pass
the
haunted
spot
the
bated
breath
and
the
fearful
glances
cast
around
told
another
tale
he
endeavoured
to
call
philosophy
to
his
aid
he
remembered
too
how
many
nights
he
had
spent
in
the
deepest
forest
without
seeing
anything
and
without
even
thinking
of
such
matters
he
reproved
himself
for
his
folly
and
asked
himself
if
ever
he
could
hope
to
be
a
successful
leader
of
men
who
started
at
a
shadow
in
vain
the
tone
of
his
mind
had
been
weakened
by
the
strain
it
had
undergone
instead
of
strengthening
him
the
teachings
of
philosophy
now
seemed
cold
and
feeble
and
it
occurred
to
him
that
possibly
the
belief
of
the
common
people
fully
shared
by
their
religious
instructors
was
just
as
much
entitled
to
credence
as
these
mere
suppositions
and
theories
the
details
of
the
volume
recurred
to
his
mind
the
accurate
description
of
the
demons
of
the
forest
and
the
hill
and
especially
the
horrible
vampires
enfolding
the
victim
with
outstretched
wings
in
spite
of
himself
incredulous
yet
excited
he
pressed
his
horse
to
greater
speed
though
the
track
was
narrow
and
very
much
broken
under
the
firs
he
obeyed
and
trotted
but
reluctantly
and
needed
continual
urging
the
yellow
spark
of
a
glowworm
shining
by
a
bush
made
him
set
his
teeth
trifling
and
well
known
as
it
was
the
light
suddenly
seen
thrilled
him
with
the
terror
of
the
unexpected
strange
rushings
sounded
among
the
fern
as
if
the
wings
of
a
demon
brushed
it
as
he
travelled
felix
knew
that
they
were
caused
by
rabbits
hastening
off
or
a
boar
bounding
away
yet
they
increased
the
feverish
excitement
with
which
he
was
burdened
though
dark
beneath
the
firs
it
was
not
like
the
darkness
of
the
beeches
these
trees
did
not
form
a
perfect
canopy
overhead
everywhere
in
places
he
could
see
where
a
streak
of
moonlight
came
aslant
through
an
opening
and
reached
the
ground
one
such
streak
fell
upon
the
track
ahead
the
trees
there
had
decayed
and
fallen
and
a
broad
band
of
light
lit
up
the
way
as
he
approached
it
and
had
almost
entered
suddenly
something
shot
towards
him
in
the
air
a
flash
as
it
were
as
if
some
object
had
crossed
the
streak
and
was
rendered
visible
for
the
tenth
of
a
second
like
a
mote
in
the
sunbeams
at
the
same
instant
of
time
the
horse
which
he
had
pressed
to
go
faster
put
his
foot
into
a
rut
or
hole
and
stumbled
and
felix
was
flung
so
far
forward
that
he
only
saved
himself
from
being
thrown
by
clinging
to
his
neck
a
slight
whizzing
sound
passed
over
his
head
followed
immediately
by
a
sharp
tap
against
a
tree
in
his
rear
the
thing
happened
in
the
twinkling
of
an
eye
but
he
recognised
the
sound
it
was
the
whiz
of
a
crossbow
bolt
which
had
missed
his
head
and
buried
its
point
in
a
fir
the
stumble
saved
him
the
bolt
would
have
struck
his
head
or
chest
had
not
the
horse
gone
nearly
on
his
knee
the
robber
had
so
planned
his
ambush
that
his
prey
should
be
well
seen
distinct
in
the
moonlight
so
that
his
aim
might
be
sure
recovering
himself
the
horse
without
needing
the
spur
as
if
he
recognised
the
danger
to
his
rider
started
forward
at
full
speed
and
raced
regardless
of
ruts
along
the
track
felix
who
had
hardly
got
into
his
seat
again
could
for
awhile
but
barely
restrain
it
so
wildly
he
fled
he
must
have
been
carried
within
a
few
yards
of
the
bandit
but
saw
nothing
neither
did
a
second
bolt
follow
him
the
crossbow
takes
time
to
bend
and
if
the
robber
had
companions
they
were
differently
armed
he
was
a
furlong
or
more
from
the
spot
before
he
quite
realized
the
danger
he
had
escaped
his
bow
was
unstrung
in
his
hand
his
arrows
were
all
in
the
quiver
thus
had
the
bolt
struck
him
even
if
the
wound
had
not
been
mortal
as
it
most
likely
would
have
been
he
could
have
made
no
resistance
how
foolish
to
disregard
the
warnings
of
the
grooms
at
the
castle
it
was
now
too
late
all
he
could
do
was
to
ride
dreading
every
moment
to
be
thrown
he
pushed
on
as
fast
as
the
horse
would
go
there
was
no
pursuit
and
after
a
mile
or
so
as
he
left
the
firs
and
entered
the
ash
woods
he
slackened
somewhat
it
was
indeed
necessary
for
here
the
hoofs
of
preceding
horsemen
had
poached
the
turf
always
damp
under
ash
into
mud
it
was
less
dark
for
the
boughs
of
the
ashes
did
not
meet
above
as
he
passed
rose
with
loud
clatterings
from
their
and
once
or
twice
he
saw
in
the
gloom
the
fiery
phosphoric
of
the
grey
how
gladly
he
recognised
presently
the
change
from
trees
to
bushes
when
he
rode
out
from
the
thick
ashes
among
the
low
hawthorns
and
knew
that
he
was
within
a
mile
or
so
of
the
south
barrier
at
home
already
he
heard
the
song
of
the
nightingale
the
long
note
which
at
night
penetrates
so
far
the
nightingale
which
loves
the
hawthorn
and
the
neighbourhood
of
man
imperceptibly
he
increased
the
speed
again
the
horse
too
knew
that
he
was
nearing
home
and
responded
willingly
the
track
was
much
broader
and
fairly
good
but
he
knew
that
at
one
spot
where
it
was
marshy
it
must
be
cut
up
there
he
went
at
the
side
almost
brushing
a
projecting
maple
bush
something
struck
the
horse
he
fancied
the
rebound
of
a
bough
he
jumped
literally
jumped
like
a
buck
and
tore
along
the
road
with
one
foot
out
of
the
stirrup
it
was
with
the
utmost
difficulty
he
stuck
to
his
seat
he
was
not
riding
but
holding
on
for
a
moment
or
two
presently
recovering
from
the
jolt
he
endeavoured
to
check
him
but
the
bit
was
of
no
avail
the
animal
was
beside
himself
with
terror
and
raced
headlong
till
they
reached
the
barrier
it
was
of
course
closed
and
the
warder
was
asleep
so
that
until
he
dismounted
and
kicked
and
shouted
no
one
challenged
him
then
the
warder
spear
in
hand
appeared
with
his
lantern
but
recognising
the
voice
ran
to
the
gate
within
the
gate
a
few
yards
there
were
the
embers
of
a
fire
and
round
it
a
bivouac
of
footmen
who
had
been
to
the
feast
and
had
returned
thus
far
before
nightfall
hearing
the
noise
some
of
them
arose
and
came
round
him
when
one
immediately
exclaimed
and
asked
if
he
was
wounded
felix
replied
that
he
was
not
but
looking
at
his
foot
where
the
man
pointed
saw
that
it
was
covered
with
blood
but
upon
close
examination
there
was
no
cut
or
incision
he
was
not
hurt
the
warder
now
called
to
them
and
showed
a
long
deep
scratch
on
the
near
flank
of
the
horse
from
which
the
blood
was
dripping
it
was
such
a
scratch
as
might
have
been
made
with
an
iron
nail
and
without
hesitation
they
all
put
it
down
to
a
bushman
spud
without
doubt
the
bushman
hearing
felix
approach
had
hidden
in
the
maple
bush
and
as
he
passed
struck
with
his
dagger
but
miscalculating
the
speed
at
which
the
horse
was
going
instead
of
piercing
the
thigh
of
the
rider
the
blow
fell
on
the
horse
and
the
sharp
point
was
dragged
along
the
side
the
horse
trembled
as
they
touched
him
sir
said
one
of
the
retainers
their
headman
if
you
will
pardon
me
you
had
best
string
your
bow
and
send
a
shaft
through
his
heart
for
he
will
die
in
misery
before
morning
the
bushman
spud
the
one
he
uses
for
assassination
or
to
despatch
his
prey
is
poisoned
it
is
a
lingering
poison
and
takes
several
hours
to
produce
its
effect
but
no
remedy
is
known
and
many
who
have
escaped
from
the
cowardly
blow
have
crawled
to
the
path
only
to
expire
in
torture
there
was
no
denying
that
what
the
retainer
proposed
was
the
only
thing
that
could
be
done
the
warder
had
meantime
brought
a
bucket
of
water
of
which
the
poor
creature
drank
eagerly
felix
could
not
do
it
he
could
not
slay
the
creature
which
had
carried
him
so
long
and
which
twice
that
night
had
saved
him
and
was
now
to
die
as
it
were
in
his
place
he
could
not
consent
to
it
he
led
the
horse
towards
home
but
he
was
weak
or
weary
and
could
not
be
got
beyond
the
pen
there
the
group
assembled
around
him
felix
ordered
the
scratch
to
be
cleansed
while
he
ran
over
in
his
mind
every
possible
remedy
he
gave
strict
orders
that
he
should
not
be
despatched
and
then
hastened
to
the
house
he
undid
with
trembling
hands
the
thongs
that
bound
his
chest
and
took
out
his
manuscripts
hoping
against
hope
that
among
the
many
notes
he
had
made
there
might
be
something
but
there
was
nothing
or
in
his
excitement
he
overlooked
it
remembering
that
oliver
was
a
great
authority
upon
horses
he
went
into
his
room
and
tried
to
wake
him
oliver
weary
with
his
ride
and
not
as
yet
having
slept
off
the
effects
of
the
feast
could
not
be
roused
felix
left
him
and
hurried
back
to
the
pen
weary
as
he
was
he
watched
by
the
horse
till
the
larks
began
to
sing
and
the
dawn
was
at
hand
as
yet
he
had
not
shown
any
severe
symptoms
except
twitching
of
the
limbs
and
a
constant
thirst
which
water
could
not
quench
but
suddenly
he
fell
and
the
old
retainer
warned
them
all
to
stand
away
for
he
would
bite
anything
that
was
near
his
words
were
instantly
fulfilled
he
rolled
and
kicked
and
bit
at
everything
within
reach
seeing
this
agony
felix
could
no
longer
delay
he
strung
his
bow
but
he
could
not
fit
the
arrow
to
the
string
he
missed
the
notch
so
much
did
his
hands
shake
he
motioned
to
the
retainers
who
had
gathered
around
and
one
of
them
thrust
his
spear
into
the
horse
behind
his
shoulder
when
felix
at
last
returned
to
his
chamber
he
could
not
but
reflect
as
the
sun
rose
and
the
beams
entered
that
every
omen
had
been
against
him
the
adder
under
foot
the
bandit
bolt
the
bushman
poisoned
point
he
slept
till
noon
and
upon
going
out
unrefreshed
and
still
weary
he
found
that
they
had
already
buried
the
horse
and
ordered
a
mound
to
be
raised
above
his
grave
the
day
passed
slowly
he
wandered
about
the
castle
and
the
enclosed
grounds
seeking
comfort
and
finding
none
his
mind
vacillated
he
recalled
all
that
aurora
had
said
persuading
him
not
to
do
anything
in
haste
or
despair
yet
he
could
not
continue
in
his
present
condition
another
day
went
by
and
still
undecided
and
doubting
he
remained
at
home
oliver
began
to
jest
at
him
had
he
abandoned
the
expedition
oliver
could
not
understand
indecision
perhaps
he
did
not
see
so
many
sides
to
the
question
his
mind
was
always
quickly
made
up
action
was
his
forte
not
thought
the
night
came
and
still
felix
lingered
hesitating
chapter
xiii
sailing
away
but
the
next
morning
felix
arose
straight
from
his
sleep
resolved
to
carry
out
his
plan
without
staying
to
think
a
moment
without
further
examination
of
the
various
sides
of
the
problem
he
started
up
the
instant
his
eyes
unclosed
fully
determined
upon
his
voyage
the
breath
of
the
bright
june
morn
as
he
threw
open
the
filled
him
with
hope
his
heart
responded
to
its
joyous
influence
the
excitement
which
had
disturbed
his
mind
had
had
time
to
subside
in
the
still
slumber
of
the
night
the
strong
undercurrent
of
his
thought
resumed
its
course
and
he
awoke
with
his
will
still
firmly
bent
in
one
direction
when
he
had
dressed
he
took
his
bow
and
the
chest
bound
with
the
leathern
thongs
and
went
down
it
was
early
but
the
baron
had
already
finished
breakfast
and
gone
out
to
his
gardens
the
baroness
had
not
yet
appeared
while
he
was
making
a
hurried
breakfast
for
having
now
made
up
his
mind
he
was
eager
to
put
his
resolve
into
execution
oliver
came
in
and
seeing
the
chest
and
the
bow
understood
that
the
hour
had
arrived
he
immediately
said
he
should
accompany
him
to
heron
bay
and
assist
him
to
start
and
went
out
to
order
their
horses
there
were
always
plenty
of
riding
horses
at
old
house
as
at
every
fortified
mansion
and
there
was
not
the
least
difficulty
in
getting
another
for
felix
in
place
of
his
old
favourite
oliver
insisted
upon
taking
the
wooden
chest
which
was
rather
heavy
before
him
on
the
saddle
so
that
felix
had
nothing
to
carry
but
his
favourite
bow
oliver
was
surprised
that
felix
did
not
first
go
to
the
gardens
and
say
to
the
baron
or
at
least
knock
at
the
baroness
door
and
bid
her
farewell
but
he
made
no
remark
knowing
felix
proud
and
occasionally
hard
temper
without
a
word
felix
left
the
old
place
he
rode
forth
from
the
north
barrier
and
did
not
even
so
much
as
look
behind
him
neither
he
nor
oliver
thought
of
the
events
that
might
happen
before
they
should
again
meet
in
the
old
familiar
house
when
the
circle
is
once
broken
up
it
is
often
years
before
it
is
reformed
often
indeed
the
members
of
it
never
meet
again
at
least
not
in
the
same
manner
which
perhaps
they
detested
then
and
ever
afterwards
regretted
without
one
word
of
farewell
without
a
glance
felix
rode
out
into
the
forest
there
was
not
much
conversation
on
the
trail
to
heron
bay
the
serfs
were
still
there
in
charge
of
the
canoe
and
were
glad
enough
to
see
their
approach
and
thus
to
be
relieved
from
their
lonely
watch
they
launched
the
canoe
with
ease
the
provisions
were
put
on
board
the
chest
lashed
to
the
mast
that
it
might
not
be
lost
the
favourite
bow
was
also
fastened
upright
to
the
mast
for
safety
and
simply
shaking
hands
with
oliver
felix
pushed
out
into
the
creek
he
paddled
the
canoe
to
the
entrance
and
out
into
the
lake
till
he
arrived
where
the
breeze
coming
over
the
forest
touched
and
rippled
the
water
which
by
the
shore
was
perfectly
calm
then
hoisting
the
sail
he
put
out
the
larger
paddle
which
answered
as
a
rudder
took
his
seat
and
waving
his
hand
to
oliver
began
his
voyage
the
wind
was
but
light
and
almost
too
favourable
for
he
had
determined
to
sail
to
the
eastward
not
for
any
specific
reason
but
because
there
the
sun
rose
and
that
was
the
quarter
of
light
and
hope
his
canoe
with
a
long
sail
and
so
well
adapted
for
working
into
the
wind
was
not
well
rigged
for
drifting
before
a
breeze
which
was
what
he
was
now
doing
he
had
merely
to
keep
the
canoe
before
the
wind
steering
so
as
to
clear
the
bold
headland
of
white
horse
which
rose
blue
from
the
water
edge
far
in
front
of
him
though
the
wind
was
light
the
canoe
being
so
taper
and
sharp
at
the
prow
and
the
sail
so
large
in
comparison
slipped
from
the
shore
faster
than
he
at
first
imagined
as
he
steered
aslant
from
the
little
bay
outwards
into
the
great
lake
the
ripples
rolling
before
the
wind
gradually
enlarged
into
wavelets
these
again
increased
and
in
half
an
hour
as
the
wind
now
played
upon
them
over
a
mile
of
surface
they
seemed
in
his
canoe
with
its
low
freeboard
to
be
considerable
waves
he
had
purposely
refrained
from
looking
back
till
now
lest
they
should
think
he
regretted
leaving
and
in
his
heart
desired
to
return
but
now
feeling
that
he
had
really
started
he
glanced
behind
he
could
see
no
one
he
had
forgotten
that
the
spot
where
they
had
launched
the
canoe
was
at
the
end
of
an
inlet
and
as
he
sailed
away
the
creek
was
shut
off
from
view
by
the
shore
of
the
lake
unable
to
get
to
the
mouth
of
the
bay
because
of
the
underwood
and
the
swampy
soil
oliver
had
remained
gazing
in
the
direction
the
canoe
had
taken
for
a
minute
or
two
absorbed
in
thought
almost
the
longest
period
he
had
ever
wasted
in
such
an
occupation
and
then
with
a
whistle
turned
to
go
the
serfs
understanding
that
they
were
no
longer
required
gathered
their
things
together
and
were
shortly
on
their
way
home
oliver
holding
horse
by
the
bridle
had
already
ridden
that
way
but
he
presently
halted
and
waited
till
the
three
men
overtook
him
he
then
gave
the
horse
into
their
charge
and
turning
to
the
right
along
a
forest
path
which
branched
off
there
went
to
ponze
felix
could
therefore
see
no
one
when
he
looked
back
and
they
were
indeed
already
on
their
way
from
the
place
he
now
felt
that
he
was
alone
he
had
parted
from
the
shore
and
from
all
the
old
associations
he
was
fast
passing
not
only
out
upon
the
water
but
out
into
the
unknown
future
but
his
spirit
no
longer
vacillated
now
that
he
was
really
in
the
beginning
of
his
long
contemplated
enterprise
his
natural
strength
of
mind
returned
the
weakness
and
irresolution
the
hesitation
left
him
he
became
full
of
his
adventure
and
thought
of
nothing
else
the
breeze
blowing
as
a
man
breathes
with
alternate
rise
and
fall
now
driving
him
along
rapidly
till
the
water
bubbled
under
the
prow
now
sinking
came
over
his
right
shoulder
and
cooled
his
cheek
for
it
was
now
noon
and
the
june
sun
was
unchecked
by
clouds
he
could
no
longer
distinguish
the
shape
of
the
trees
on
shore
all
the
boughs
were
blended
together
in
one
great
wood
stretching
as
far
as
he
could
see
on
his
left
there
was
a
chain
of
islands
some
covered
with
firs
and
others
only
with
brushwood
while
others
again
were
so
low
and
flat
that
the
waves
in
stormy
weather
broke
almost
over
them
as
he
drew
near
white
horse
five
white
terns
or
flew
over
he
did
not
welcome
their
appearance
as
they
usually
preceded
rough
gales
the
headland
wooded
to
its
ridge
now
rose
high
against
the
sky
ash
and
and
hawthorn
had
concealed
the
ancient
graven
figure
of
the
horse
upon
its
side
but
the
tradition
was
not
forgotten
and
the
site
retained
its
name
he
had
been
steering
so
as
just
to
clear
the
promontory
but
he
now
remembered
that
when
he
had
visited
the
summit
of
the
hill
he
had
observed
that
banks
and
shoals
extended
far
out
from
the
shore
and
were
nearly
on
a
level
with
the
surface
of
the
lake
in
a
calm
they
were
visible
but
waves
concealed
them
and
unless
the
helmsman
recognised
the
swirl
sufficiently
early
to
change
his
course
they
were
extremely
dangerous
felix
bore
more
out
from
the
land
and
passing
fully
a
mile
to
the
north
left
the
shoals
on
his
right
on
his
other
hand
there
was
a
sandy
and
barren
island
barely
a
quarter
of
a
mile
distant
upon
which
he
thought
he
saw
the
timbers
of
a
wreck
it
was
quite
probable
for
the
island
lay
in
the
track
of
vessels
coasting
along
the
shore
beyond
white
horse
the
land
fell
away
in
a
series
of
indentations
curving
inwards
to
the
south
an
inhospitable
coast
for
the
hills
came
down
to
the
strand
ending
abruptly
in
low
but
steep
chalk
cliffs
many
islands
of
large
size
stood
out
on
the
left
but
felix
not
knowing
the
shape
of
the
lake
beyond
white
horse
thought
it
best
to
follow
the
trend
of
the
land
he
thus
found
after
about
three
hours
that
he
had
gone
far
out
of
his
course
for
the
curve
of
the
coast
now
began
to
return
to
the
northward
and
looking
in
that
direction
he
saw
a
merchant
vessel
under
her
one
square
sail
of
great
size
standing
across
the
bay
she
was
about
five
miles
distant
and
was
evidently
steering
so
as
to
keep
just
inside
the
line
of
the
islands
felix
with
some
difficulty
steered
in
a
direction
to
interrupt
her
the
wind
being
then
immediately
aft
his
sail
did
not
answer
well
presently
he
lowered
it
and
paddled
till
he
had
turned
the
course
so
that
the
outrigger
was
now
on
the
eastern
side
then
hoisting
the
sail
again
he
sat
at
what
had
before
been
the
prow
and
steered
a
point
or
so
nearer
the
wind
this
improved
her
sailing
but
as
the
merchant
ship
had
at
least
five
miles
start
it
would
take
some
hours
to
overtake
her
nor
on
reflection
was
he
at
all
anxious
to
come
up
with
her
for
mariners
were
dreaded
for
their
lawless
conduct
being
when
on
a
voyage
beyond
all
jurisdiction
on
the
one
hand
if
they
saw
an
opportunity
they
did
not
hesitate
to
land
and
pillage
a
house
or
even
a
hamlet
on
the
other
those
who
dwelt
anywhere
near
the
shore
considered
it
good
sport
to
light
a
fire
and
lure
a
vessel
to
her
destruction
or
if
she
was
becalmed
to
sally
out
in
boats
attack
and
perhaps
destroy
both
ship
and
crew
hence
the
many
wrecks
and
losses
and
the
risks
of
navigation
not
so
much
from
natural
obstacles
since
the
innumerable
islands
and
the
creeks
and
inlets
of
the
mainland
almost
always
offered
shelter
no
matter
which
way
the
storm
blew
but
from
the
animosity
of
the
coast
people
if
there
was
an
important
harbour
and
a
town
where
provisions
could
be
obtained
or
repairs
effected
the
right
of
entrance
was
jealously
guarded
and
no
ship
however
pressed
by
the
gale
was
permitted
to
leave
if
she
had
anchored
without
payment
of
a
fine
so
that
vessels
as
much
as
possible
avoided
the
harbours
and
towns
and
the
mainland
altogether
sailing
along
beside
the
islands
which
were
for
the
most
part
uninhabited
and
anchoring
under
their
lee
at
night
felix
remembering
the
character
of
the
mariners
resolved
to
keep
well
away
from
them
but
to
watch
their
course
as
a
guide
to
himself
the
mainland
now
ran
abruptly
to
the
north
and
the
canoe
as
he
brought
her
more
into
the
wind
sprang
forward
at
a
rapid
pace
the
outrigger
prevented
her
from
making
any
leeway
or
heeling
over
and
the
large
spread
of
sail
forced
her
swiftly
through
the
water
he
had
lost
sight
of
the
ship
behind
some
islands
and
as
he
approached
these
began
to
ask
himself
if
he
had
not
better
haul
down
his
sail
there
as
he
must
now
be
getting
near
her
when
to
his
surprise
on
coming
close
he
saw
her
great
square
sail
in
the
middle
as
it
seemed
of
the
land
the
shore
there
was
flat
the
hills
which
had
hitherto
bounded
it
suddenly
ceasing
it
was
overgrown
with
reeds
and
flags
and
about
two
miles
away
the
dark
sail
of
the
merchantman
drifted
over
these
the
hull
being
hidden
he
at
once
knew
that
he
had
reached
the
western
mouth
of
the
straits
which
divide
the
southern
and
northern
mainland
when
he
went
to
see
the
channel
on
foot
through
the
forest
he
must
have
struck
it
a
mile
or
two
more
to
the
east
where
it
wound
under
the
hills
in
another
half
hour
he
arrived
at
the
opening
of
the
strait
it
was
about
a
mile
wide
and
either
shore
was
quite
flat
that
on
the
right
for
a
short
distance
the
range
of
downs
approaching
within
two
miles
that
on
the
left
or
north
was
level
as
far
as
he
could
see
he
had
now
again
to
lower
his
sail
to
get
the
outrigger
on
his
lee
as
he
turned
to
the
right
and
steered
due
east
into
the
channel
so
long
as
the
shore
was
level
he
had
no
difficulty
for
the
wind
drew
over
it
but
when
the
hills
gradually
came
near
and
almost
overhung
the
channel
they
shut
off
much
of
the
breeze
and
his
progress
was
slow
when
it
turned
and
ran
narrowing
every
moment
to
the
south
the
wind
failed
him
altogether
on
the
right
shore
wooded
hills
rose
from
the
water
like
a
wall
on
the
left
it
was
a
perfect
plain
he
could
see
nothing
of
the
merchantman
although
he
knew
that
she
could
not
sail
here
but
must
be
working
through
with
her
sweeps
her
heavy
hull
and
bluff
bow
must
make
the
rowing
a
slow
and
laborious
process
therefore
she
could
not
be
far
ahead
but
was
concealed
by
the
winding
of
the
strait
he
lowered
the
sail
as
it
was
now
useless
and
began
to
paddle
in
a
very
short
time
he
found
the
heat
under
the
hills
oppressive
when
thus
working
he
had
now
been
afloat
between
six
and
seven
hours
and
must
have
come
fully
thirty
miles
perhaps
rather
more
than
twenty
in
a
straight
line
and
he
felt
somewhat
weary
and
cramped
from
sitting
so
long
in
the
canoe
though
he
paddled
hard
he
did
not
seem
to
make
much
progress
and
at
length
he
recognised
that
there
was
a
distinct
current
which
opposed
his
advance
flowing
through
the
channel
from
east
to
west
if
he
ceased
paddling
he
found
he
drifted
slowly
back
the
long
aquatic
weeds
too
which
he
passed
all
extended
their
floating
streamers
westward
we
did
not
know
of
this
current
till
felix
aquila
observed
and
recorded
it
tired
and
hungry
for
full
of
his
voyage
he
had
taken
no
refreshments
since
he
started
he
resolved
to
land
rest
a
little
while
and
then
ascend
the
hill
and
see
what
he
could
of
the
channel
he
soon
reached
the
shore
the
strait
having
narrowed
to
less
than
a
mile
in
width
and
ran
the
canoe
on
the
ground
by
a
bush
to
which
on
getting
out
he
attached
the
painter
the
relief
of
stretching
his
limbs
was
so
great
that
it
seemed
to
endow
him
with
fresh
strength
and
without
waiting
to
eat
he
at
once
climbed
the
hill
from
the
top
the
remainder
of
the
strait
could
be
easily
distinguished
but
a
short
distance
from
where
he
stood
it
bent
again
and
proceeded
due
east
chapter
xiv
the
straits
the
passage
contracted
there
to
little
over
half
a
mile
but
these
narrows
did
not
continue
far
the
shores
having
approached
thus
near
each
other
quickly
receded
till
presently
they
were
at
least
two
miles
apart
the
merchant
vessel
had
passed
the
narrows
with
the
aid
of
her
sweeps
but
she
moved
slowly
and
as
it
seemed
to
him
with
difficulty
she
was
about
a
mile
and
a
half
distant
and
near
the
eastern
mouth
of
the
strait
as
felix
watched
he
saw
her
square
sail
again
raised
showing
that
she
had
reached
a
spot
where
the
hills
ceased
to
shut
off
the
wind
entering
the
open
lake
she
altered
her
course
and
sailed
away
to
the
following
the
course
of
the
northern
mainland
looking
now
eastwards
across
the
lake
he
saw
a
vast
and
beautiful
expanse
of
water
without
island
or
break
of
any
kind
reaching
to
the
horizon
northwards
and
southwards
the
land
fell
rapidly
away
skirted
as
usual
with
islets
and
shoals
between
which
and
the
shore
vessels
usually
voyaged
he
had
heard
of
this
open
water
and
it
was
his
intention
to
sail
out
into
and
explore
it
but
as
the
sun
now
began
to
decline
towards
the
west
he
considered
that
he
had
better
wait
till
morning
and
so
have
a
whole
day
before
him
meantime
he
would
paddle
through
the
channel
beach
the
canoe
on
the
islet
that
stood
farthest
out
and
so
start
clear
on
the
morrow
turning
now
to
look
back
the
other
way
westward
he
was
surprised
to
see
a
second
channel
which
came
almost
to
the
foot
of
the
hill
on
which
he
stood
but
there
ended
and
did
not
connect
with
the
first
the
entrance
to
it
was
concealed
as
he
now
saw
by
an
island
past
which
he
must
have
sailed
that
afternoon
this
second
or
blind
channel
seemed
more
familiar
to
him
than
the
flat
and
reedy
shore
at
the
mouth
of
the
true
strait
and
he
now
recognised
it
as
the
one
to
which
he
had
journeyed
on
foot
through
the
forest
he
had
not
then
struck
the
true
strait
at
all
he
had
sat
down
and
pondered
beside
this
deceptive
inlet
thinking
that
it
divided
the
mainlands
from
this
discovery
he
saw
how
easy
it
was
to
be
misled
in
such
matters
but
it
even
more
fully
convinced
him
of
the
importance
of
this
uninhabited
and
neglected
place
it
seemed
like
a
canal
cut
on
purpose
to
supply
a
fort
from
the
lake
in
the
rear
with
provisions
and
material
supposing
access
in
front
prevented
by
hostile
fleets
and
armies
a
castle
if
built
near
where
he
stood
would
command
the
channel
arrows
indeed
could
not
be
shot
across
but
vessels
under
the
protection
of
the
castle
could
dispute
the
passage
obstructed
as
it
could
be
with
floating
booms
an
invader
coming
from
the
north
must
cross
here
for
many
years
past
there
had
been
a
general
feeling
that
some
day
such
an
attempt
would
be
made
fortifications
would
be
of
incalculable
value
in
repelling
the
hostile
hordes
and
preventing
their
landing
who
held
this
strait
would
possess
the
key
of
the
lake
and
would
be
master
of
or
would
at
least
hold
the
balance
between
the
kings
and
republics
dotted
along
the
coasts
on
either
hand
no
vessel
could
pass
without
his
permission
it
was
the
most
patent
illustration
of
the
extremely
local
horizon
the
contracted
mental
view
of
the
petty
kings
and
their
statesmen
who
were
so
concerned
about
the
frontiers
of
their
provinces
and
frequently
interfered
and
fought
for
a
single
palisaded
estate
or
barony
yet
were
quite
oblivious
of
the
opportunity
of
empire
open
here
to
any
who
could
seize
it
if
the
governor
of
such
a
castle
as
he
imagined
built
upon
the
strait
had
also
vessels
of
war
they
could
lie
in
this
second
channel
sheltered
from
all
winds
and
ready
to
sally
forth
and
take
an
attacking
force
upon
the
flank
while
he
pondered
upon
these
advantages
he
could
not
conceal
from
himself
that
he
had
once
sat
down
and
dreamed
beside
this
second
inlet
thinking
it
to
be
the
channel
the
doubt
arose
whether
if
he
was
so
easily
misled
in
such
a
large
tangible
and
purely
physical
matter
he
might
not
be
deceived
also
in
his
ideas
whether
if
tested
they
might
not
fail
whether
the
world
was
not
right
and
he
wrong
the
very
clearness
and
character
of
his
mind
often
hindered
and
even
checked
altogether
the
best
founded
of
his
impressions
the
more
especially
when
he
as
it
were
stood
still
and
thought
in
reverie
the
subtlety
of
his
mind
entangled
him
in
action
he
was
almost
always
right
action
prompted
his
decision
descending
from
the
hill
he
now
took
some
refreshment
and
then
pushed
out
again
in
the
canoe
so
powerful
was
the
current
in
the
narrowest
part
of
the
strait
that
it
occupied
him
two
hours
in
paddling
as
many
miles
when
he
was
free
of
the
channel
he
hoisted
sail
and
directed
his
course
straight
out
for
an
island
which
stood
almost
opposite
the
entrance
but
as
he
approached
driven
along
at
a
good
pace
suddenly
the
canoe
seemed
to
be
seized
from
beneath
he
knew
in
a
moment
that
he
had
grounded
on
soft
mud
and
sprang
up
to
lower
the
sail
but
before
he
could
do
so
the
canoe
came
to
a
standstill
on
the
and
the
waves
following
behind
directly
she
stopped
broke
over
the
stern
fortunately
they
were
but
small
having
only
a
mile
or
so
to
roll
from
the
shore
but
they
flung
enough
water
on
board
in
a
few
minutes
to
spoil
part
of
his
provisions
and
to
set
everything
afloat
that
was
loose
on
the
bottom
of
the
vessel
he
was
apprehensive
lest
she
should
fill
for
he
now
perceived
that
he
had
forgotten
to
provide
anything
with
which
to
bale
her
out
something
is
always
forgotten
having
got
the
sail
down
lest
the
wind
should
snap
the
mast
he
tried
hard
to
force
the
canoe
back
with
his
longer
paddle
used
as
a
movable
rudder
his
weight
and
the
resistance
of
the
adhesive
mud
on
which
she
had
driven
with
much
force
was
too
great
he
could
not
shove
her
off
when
he
pushed
the
paddle
sank
into
the
soft
bottom
and
gave
him
nothing
to
press
against
after
struggling
for
some
time
he
paused
beginning
to
fear
that
his
voyage
had
already
reached
an
end
a
minute
thought
more
potent
than
the
strength
of
ten
men
showed
him
that
the
canoe
required
lightening
there
was
no
cargo
to
throw
overboard
nor
ballast
he
was
the
only
weight
he
immediately
undressed
and
let
himself
overboard
at
the
prow
retaining
hold
of
the
stem
his
feet
sank
deep
into
the
ooze
he
felt
as
if
had
he
let
go
he
should
have
gradually
gone
down
into
this
quicksand
of
fine
mud
by
rapidly
moving
his
feet
he
managed
however
to
push
the
canoe
she
rose
considerably
so
soon
as
he
was
out
of
her
and
although
he
had
hold
of
the
prow
still
his
body
was
lighter
in
the
water
pushing
struggling
and
pressing
forward
he
by
sheer
impact
as
it
were
for
his
feet
found
no
hold
in
the
mud
forced
her
back
by
slow
degrees
the
blows
of
the
waves
drove
her
forward
almost
as
much
as
he
pushed
her
back
still
in
time
and
when
his
strength
was
fast
decreasing
she
did
move
and
he
had
the
satisfaction
of
feeling
the
water
deeper
beneath
him
but
when
he
endeavoured
to
pull
himself
into
the
canoe
over
the
prow
directly
his
motive
power
ceased
the
waves
undid
the
advance
he
had
achieved
and
he
had
to
resume
his
labour
this
time
thinking
again
before
he
attempted
to
get
into
the
canoe
he
turned
her
sideways
to
the
wind
with
the
outrigger
to
leeward
when
her
sharp
prow
and
rounded
keel
struck
the
end
on
she
ran
easily
along
it
but
turned
sideways
her
length
found
more
resistance
and
though
the
waves
sent
her
some
way
upon
it
she
soon
came
to
a
standstill
he
clambered
in
as
quickly
as
he
could
it
is
not
easy
to
get
into
a
boat
out
of
the
water
the
body
feels
so
heavy
and
taking
the
paddle
without
waiting
to
dress
worked
away
from
the
spot
not
till
he
had
got
some
quarter
of
a
mile
back
towards
the
mainland
did
he
pause
to
dry
himself
and
resume
part
of
his
clothing
the
canoe
being
still
partly
full
of
water
it
was
no
use
to
put
on
all
resting
awhile
after
his
severe
exertions
he
looked
back
and
now
supposed
from
the
colour
of
the
water
and
the
general
indications
that
these
shallows
extended
a
long
distance
surrounding
the
islands
at
the
mouth
of
the
channel
so
that
no
vessel
could
enter
or
pass
out
in
a
direct
line
but
must
steer
to
the
north
or
south
until
the
obstacle
was
rounded
afraid
to
attempt
to
land
on
another
island
his
only
course
as
the
sun
was
now
going
down
was
to
return
to
the
mainland
which
he
reached
without
much
trouble
as
the
current
favoured
him
he
drew
the
canoe
upon
the
ground
as
far
as
he
could
it
was
not
a
good
place
to
land
as
the
bottom
was
chalk
washed
into
holes
by
the
waves
and
studded
with
angular
flints
as
the
wind
was
off
the
shore
it
did
not
matter
if
it
had
blown
from
the
east
his
canoe
might
very
likely
have
been
much
damaged
the
shore
was
overgrown
with
hazel
to
within
twenty
yards
of
the
water
then
the
ground
rose
and
was
clothed
with
low
whose
boughs
seemed
much
stunted
by
tempest
showing
how
exposed
the
spot
was
to
the
easterly
gales
of
spring
the
wind
was
shut
off
by
the
hills
beyond
felix
was
so
weary
that
for
some
time
he
did
nothing
save
rest
upon
the
ground
which
was
but
scantily
covered
with
grass
an
hour
rest
however
restored
him
to
himself
he
gathered
some
dry
sticks
there
were
plenty
under
the
ashes
struck
his
flint
against
the
steel
ignited
the
tinder
and
soon
had
a
fire
it
was
not
necessary
for
warmth
the
june
evening
was
soft
and
warm
but
it
was
the
hunter
instinct
upon
camping
for
the
night
the
hunter
unless
bushmen
are
suspected
to
be
in
the
neighbourhood
invariably
lights
a
fire
first
to
cook
his
supper
and
secondly
and
often
principally
to
make
the
spot
his
home
the
hearth
is
home
whether
there
be
walls
round
it
or
not
directly
there
are
glowing
embers
the
place
is
no
longer
wild
it
becomes
human
felix
had
nothing
that
needed
cooking
he
took
his
cowhide
from
the
canoe
and
spread
it
on
the
ground
a
cowhide
is
the
first
possession
of
every
hunter
it
keeps
him
from
the
damp
and
with
a
second
supported
on
three
short
poles
stuck
in
the
earth
two
crossed
at
the
top
in
front
forming
a
fork
and
fastened
with
a
thong
the
third
resting
on
these
he
protects
himself
from
the
heaviest
rain
this
little
tent
is
always
built
with
the
back
to
windward
felix
did
not
erect
a
second
hide
the
evening
was
so
warm
and
beautiful
he
did
not
need
it
his
cloak
would
be
ample
for
covering
the
fire
crackled
and
blazed
at
intervals
just
far
enough
from
him
that
he
might
feel
no
inconvenience
from
its
heat
thrushes
sang
in
the
ash
wood
all
around
him
the
cuckoo
called
and
the
never
ceased
for
a
moment
before
him
stretched
the
expanse
of
waters
he
could
even
here
see
over
the
low
islands
in
the
sky
a
streak
of
cloud
was
tinted
by
the
sunset
slowly
becoming
paler
as
the
light
departed
he
reclined
in
that
idle
thoughtless
state
which
succeeds
unusual
effort
till
the
deepening
shadow
and
the
sinking
fire
and
the
appearance
of
a
star
warned
him
that
the
night
was
really
here
then
he
arose
threw
on
more
fuel
and
fetched
his
cloak
his
chest
and
his
boar
spear
from
the
canoe
the
chest
he
covered
with
a
corner
of
the
hide
wrapped
himself
in
the
cloak
bringing
it
well
over
his
face
on
account
of
the
dew
then
drawing
the
lower
corners
of
the
hide
over
his
feet
and
limbs
he
stretched
himself
at
full
length
and
fell
asleep
with
the
spear
beside
him
there
was
the
possibility
of
bushmen
but
not
much
probability
there
would
be
far
more
danger
near
the
forest
path
where
they
might
expect
a
traveller
and
watch
to
waylay
him
but
they
could
not
tell
beforehand
where
he
would
rest
that
night
if
any
had
seen
the
movements
of
his
canoe
if
any
lighted
upon
his
bivouac
by
chance
his
fate
was
certain
he
knew
this
but
trusted
to
the
extreme
improbability
of
bushmen
frequenting
a
place
where
there
was
nothing
to
plunder
besides
he
had
no
choice
as
he
could
not
reach
the
islands
if
there
was
risk
it
was
forgotten
in
the
extremity
of
his
weariness
chapter
xv
sailing
onwards
when
felix
awoke
he
knew
at
once
by
the
height
of
the
sun
that
the
morning
was
far
advanced
throwing
off
his
cloak
he
stood
up
but
immediately
crouched
down
again
for
a
vessel
was
passing
but
a
short
distance
from
the
shore
and
nearly
opposite
his
encampment
she
had
two
masts
and
from
the
flags
flying
the
numerous
bannerets
and
the
movements
of
so
many
men
on
board
he
knew
her
to
be
a
ship
of
war
he
was
anxious
that
he
should
not
be
seen
and
regretted
that
his
canoe
was
so
much
exposed
for
the
bush
by
which
he
had
landed
hid
it
only
from
one
side
as
the
shore
was
so
bare
and
open
if
they
looked
that
way
the
men
on
board
would
hardly
fail
to
see
it
and
might
even
distinguish
him
but
whether
they
were
too
much
engaged
with
their
own
affairs
or
kept
a
careless
no
notice
appeared
to
be
taken
no
boat
was
lowered
he
watched
the
for
nearly
an
hour
before
he
ventured
to
move
her
course
was
to
the
eastward
inside
the
fringe
of
islands
that
she
was
neither
irish
nor
welsh
he
was
certain
from
her
build
and
from
her
flags
they
were
too
distant
for
the
exact
designs
upon
them
to
be
seen
but
near
enough
for
him
to
know
that
they
were
not
those
displayed
by
the
foreigners
she
sailed
fast
having
the
wind
nearly
aft
which
suited
her
two
square
sails
the
wind
had
risen
high
during
the
night
and
now
blew
almost
a
gale
so
that
he
saw
he
must
abandon
for
the
present
his
project
of
sailing
out
upon
the
open
water
the
waves
there
would
be
too
high
for
his
canoe
which
floated
low
in
the
water
and
had
but
about
six
inches
freeboard
they
would
wash
over
and
possibly
swamp
her
only
two
courses
were
open
to
him
either
to
sail
inside
the
islands
under
shelter
of
the
land
or
to
remain
where
he
was
till
the
breeze
moderated
if
he
sailed
inside
the
islands
following
the
northward
course
of
the
merchant
vessel
he
had
observed
the
previous
evening
that
would
carry
him
past
eaststock
the
eastern
port
of
sypolis
which
city
itself
inland
had
two
harbours
with
the
western
of
which
weststock
it
had
communication
by
water
should
he
continue
to
sail
on
he
would
soon
reach
that
part
of
the
northern
continent
which
was
occupied
by
the
irish
outposts
on
the
other
hand
to
follow
the
east
by
south
would
he
knew
bring
him
by
the
great
city
of
aisi
famous
for
its
commerce
its
riches
and
the
warlike
disposition
of
its
king
isembard
he
was
the
acknowledged
head
of
the
forces
of
the
league
but
yet
with
the
inconsistency
of
the
age
sometimes
attacked
other
members
of
it
his
furious
energy
was
always
disturbing
the
world
and
felix
had
no
doubt
he
was
now
at
war
with
some
one
or
other
and
that
the
he
had
seen
was
on
its
way
to
assist
him
or
his
enemies
one
of
the
possibilities
which
had
impelled
him
to
this
voyage
was
that
of
taking
service
with
some
king
or
commander
and
so
perhaps
gradually
rising
himself
to
command
such
adventures
were
very
common
knights
often
setting
forth
upon
such
expeditions
when
dissatisfied
with
their
own
rulers
and
they
were
usually
much
welcomed
as
an
addition
to
the
strength
of
the
camp
they
sought
but
there
was
this
difference
that
such
knights
carried
with
them
some
substantial
recommendation
either
numerous
retainers
well
armed
and
accustomed
to
battle
considerable
treasure
or
at
least
a
reputation
for
prowess
in
the
field
felix
had
nothing
to
offer
and
for
nothing
nothing
is
given
the
world
does
not
recognise
intrinsic
worth
or
potential
genius
genius
must
accomplish
some
solid
result
before
it
is
applauded
and
received
the
unknown
architect
may
say
i
have
a
design
in
my
mind
for
an
impregnable
castle
but
the
world
can
not
see
or
appreciate
the
mere
design
if
by
any
personal
sacrifice
of
time
dignity
or
the
architect
after
long
years
can
persuade
someone
to
permit
him
to
build
the
castle
to
put
his
design
into
solid
stone
which
squadrons
may
knock
their
heads
against
in
vain
then
he
is
acknowledged
there
is
then
a
tangible
result
felix
was
in
the
position
of
the
architect
he
believed
he
had
ideas
but
he
had
nothing
substantial
no
result
to
point
to
he
had
therefore
but
little
hope
of
success
and
his
natural
hauteur
and
pride
revolted
against
making
application
for
enrolment
which
must
be
accompanied
with
much
personal
humiliation
since
at
best
he
could
but
begin
in
the
common
ranks
the
very
idea
of
asking
was
repugnant
to
him
the
thought
of
aurora
however
drew
him
on
the
pride
was
false
he
said
to
himself
and
arose
from
too
high
an
estimate
of
his
abilities
or
it
was
the
consequence
of
living
so
long
entirely
secluded
from
the
world
he
acknowledged
to
himself
that
he
had
not
been
beaten
down
to
his
level
full
of
devotion
to
aurora
he
resolved
to
humble
himself
to
seek
the
humblest
service
in
king
isembard
camp
to
bow
his
spirit
to
the
orders
of
men
above
him
in
rank
but
below
him
in
birth
and
ability
to
submit
to
the
numberless
indignities
of
a
common
soldier
life
he
proceeded
to
launch
the
canoe
and
had
already
placed
the
chest
on
board
when
it
occurred
to
him
that
the
difficulties
he
had
encountered
the
previous
evening
when
his
canoe
was
so
nearly
lost
arose
from
his
ignorance
of
the
channels
it
would
be
advisable
to
ascend
the
hill
and
carefully
survey
the
coast
as
far
as
possible
before
setting
forth
he
did
so
the
was
still
visible
from
the
summit
but
while
he
looked
she
was
hidden
by
the
intervening
islands
the
white
foam
and
angry
appearance
of
the
distant
open
water
direct
to
the
eastward
showed
how
wise
he
had
been
not
to
attempt
its
exploration
under
the
land
the
wind
was
steady
yonder
where
the
gale
struck
the
surface
with
all
its
force
the
waves
were
large
and
powerful
from
this
spot
he
could
see
nearly
the
whole
length
of
the
strait
and
gazing
up
it
in
the
direction
he
had
come
he
saw
some
boats
crossing
in
the
distance
as
they
moved
so
slowly
and
appeared
so
broad
he
conjectured
that
they
were
punts
and
straining
his
eyes
he
fancied
he
detected
horses
on
board
he
watched
four
cross
and
presently
the
first
punt
returned
as
if
for
another
freight
he
now
noticed
that
there
was
a
land
route
by
which
travellers
or
waggons
came
down
from
the
northward
and
crossed
the
strait
by
a
ferry
it
appeared
that
the
ferry
was
not
in
the
narrowest
part
of
the
strait
but
nearer
its
western
mouth
where
the
shores
were
flat
and
covered
with
reeds
and
flags
he
wondered
that
he
had
not
seen
anything
of
the
or
of
the
or
some
sign
of
this
traffic
when
he
passed
but
concluded
that
the
track
was
hidden
among
the
dense
growth
of
reed
and
flag
and
that
the
punts
not
being
in
use
that
day
had
been
drawn
up
and
perhaps
covered
with
green
boughs
to
shelter
them
from
the
heat
of
the
summer
sun
the
fact
of
this
route
existing
however
gave
additional
importance
to
the
establishment
of
a
fort
on
the
shore
of
the
strait
as
he
had
so
long
contemplated
by
now
the
first
punt
had
obtained
another
load
and
was
the
channel
it
was
evident
that
a
caravan
of
travellers
or
merchants
had
arrived
such
persons
usually
travelling
in
large
bodies
for
safety
so
that
the
routes
were
often
deserted
for
weeks
together
and
then
suddenly
covered
with
people
routes
indeed
they
were
and
not
roads
mere
tracks
worn
through
the
forest
and
over
the
hills
often
impassable
from
floods
still
further
satisfied
that
his
original
idea
of
a
castle
here
was
founded
on
a
correct
estimate
of
the
value
of
the
spot
felix
resolved
to
keep
the
conception
to
himself
and
not
again
to
hazard
it
to
others
who
might
despise
him
but
adopt
his
design
with
one
long
last
glance
at
the
narrow
streak
of
water
which
formed
the
central
part
as
it
were
of
his
many
plans
he
descended
the
hill
and
pushed
off
in
the
canoe
his
course
this
time
gave
him
much
less
trouble
than
the
day
before
when
he
had
frequently
to
change
his
tack
the
steady
strong
breeze
came
off
the
land
to
which
he
was
too
close
for
any
waves
to
arise
and
hour
after
hour
passed
without
any
necessity
to
shift
the
sail
further
than
to
ease
or
tighten
the
sheets
as
the
course
of
the
land
varied
by
degrees
the
wind
came
more
and
more
across
his
course
at
right
angles
to
it
and
then
began
to
fall
aft
as
he
described
an
arc
and
the
land
projected
northwards
he
saw
several
small
villages
on
the
shore
and
passed
one
narrow
bay
which
seemed
indeed
to
penetrate
into
the
land
deeper
than
he
could
actually
see
suddenly
after
four
or
five
hours
sailing
he
saw
the
tower
of
a
church
over
the
wooded
hills
this
he
knew
must
indicate
the
position
of
aisi
the
question
now
came
whether
he
should
sail
into
the
harbour
when
he
would
of
course
at
once
be
seen
and
have
to
undergo
the
examination
of
the
officers
or
should
he
land
and
go
on
foot
to
the
city
a
minute
reflection
assured
him
the
latter
was
the
better
plan
for
his
canoe
was
of
so
unusual
a
construction
that
it
would
be
more
than
carefully
examined
and
not
unlikely
his
little
treasures
would
be
discovered
and
appropriated
without
hesitation
therefore
and
congratulating
himself
that
there
were
no
vessels
in
sight
he
ran
the
canoe
on
shore
among
the
flags
and
reeds
which
bordered
it
he
drew
her
up
as
far
as
his
strength
permitted
and
not
only
took
down
the
sail
but
unshipped
the
mast
then
cutting
a
quantity
of
dead
reeds
he
scattered
them
over
her
so
that
unless
a
boat
passed
very
close
to
the
land
she
would
not
be
seen
while
he
had
a
meal
he
considered
how
he
had
better
proceed
the
only
arms
with
which
he
excelled
were
the
bow
and
arrow
clearly
therefore
if
he
wished
an
engagement
he
should
take
these
with
him
and
exhibit
his
skill
but
well
he
knew
the
utter
absence
of
law
and
justice
except
for
the
powerful
his
bow
which
he
so
greatly
valued
and
which
was
so
well
seasoned
and
could
be
relied
upon
might
be
taken
from
him
his
arrows
so
carefully
prepared
from
chosen
wood
and
pointed
with
steel
might
be
seized
both
bow
and
arrows
were
far
superior
to
those
used
by
the
hunters
and
soldiery
and
he
dreaded
losing
them
there
was
his
crossbow
but
it
was
weak
and
intended
for
killing
only
small
game
as
birds
and
at
short
range
he
could
make
no
display
with
that
sword
he
had
none
for
defence
there
remained
only
his
boar
spear
and
with
this
he
resolved
to
be
content
trusting
to
obtain
the
loan
of
a
bow
when
the
time
came
to
display
his
skill
and
that
fortune
would
enable
him
to
triumph
with
an
inferior
weapon
after
resting
awhile
and
stretching
his
limbs
cramped
in
the
canoe
he
set
out
carrying
his
only
along
the
shore
for
the
thick
growth
of
the
firs
would
not
let
him
penetrate
in
the
direction
he
had
seen
the
tower
he
had
to
force
his
way
through
the
reeds
and
flags
and
brushwood
which
flourished
between
the
firs
and
the
water
edge
it
was
hard
work
walking
or
rather
pushing
through
these
obstacles
and
he
rejoiced
when
he
emerged
upon
the
slope
of
a
down
where
there
was
an
open
sward
and
but
a
few
scattered
groups
of
firs
the
fact
of
it
being
open
and
the
shortness
of
the
sward
showed
at
once
that
it
was
used
for
grazing
purposes
for
cattle
and
sheep
here
he
could
walk
freely
and
soon
reached
the
top
thence
the
city
was
visible
almost
underneath
him
it
stood
at
the
base
of
a
low
narrow
promontory
which
ran
a
long
way
into
the
lake
the
narrow
bank
near
where
it
joined
the
mainland
was
penetrated
by
a
channel
or
creek
about
a
hundred
yards
wide
or
less
which
channel
appeared
to
enter
the
land
and
was
lost
from
sight
of
among
the
trees
beyond
this
channel
a
river
ran
into
the
lake
and
in
the
y
between
the
creek
and
the
river
the
city
had
been
built
it
was
surrounded
with
a
brick
wall
and
there
were
two
large
round
brick
towers
on
the
land
side
which
indicated
the
position
of
the
castle
and
palace
the
space
enclosed
by
the
walls
was
not
more
than
half
a
mile
square
and
the
houses
did
not
occupy
nearly
all
of
it
there
were
open
places
gardens
and
even
small
paddocks
among
them
none
of
the
houses
were
more
than
two
storeys
high
but
what
at
once
struck
a
stranger
was
the
fact
that
they
were
all
roofed
with
red
tiles
most
of
the
houses
of
that
day
being
thatched
or
covered
with
shingles
of
wood
as
felix
afterwards
learnt
this
had
been
effected
during
the
reign
of
the
present
king
whose
object
was
to
protect
his
city
from
being
set
on
fire
by
burning
arrows
the
encircling
wall
had
become
a
dull
red
hue
from
the
long
exposure
to
the
weather
but
the
roofs
were
a
brighter
red
there
was
no
ensign
flying
on
either
of
the
towers
from
which
he
concluded
that
the
king
at
that
moment
was
absent
chapter
xvi
the
city
slowly
descending
towards
the
city
felix
looked
in
vain
for
any
means
of
crossing
the
channel
or
creek
which
extended
upon
the
side
of
it
and
in
which
he
counted
merchant
vessels
at
anchor
or
moored
to
the
bank
besides
a
number
of
smaller
craft
and
boats
the
ship
of
war
which
had
arrived
before
him
was
beached
close
up
by
a
gate
of
the
city
which
opened
on
the
creek
or
port
and
her
crew
were
busily
engaged
discharging
her
stores
as
he
walked
beside
the
creek
trying
to
call
the
attention
of
some
boatman
to
take
him
across
he
was
impressed
by
the
silence
for
though
the
city
wall
was
not
much
more
than
a
stone
throw
distant
there
was
none
of
the
usual
hum
which
arises
from
the
movements
of
people
on
looking
closer
he
noticed
too
that
there
were
few
persons
on
the
merchant
vessels
and
not
one
gang
at
work
loading
or
unloading
except
the
warder
stalking
to
and
fro
on
the
wall
and
the
crew
of
the
there
was
no
one
visible
as
the
warder
paced
to
and
fro
the
blade
of
his
partisan
gleamed
in
the
sunshine
he
must
have
seen
felix
but
with
military
indifference
did
not
pay
the
slightest
heed
to
the
latter
efforts
to
attract
his
attention
he
now
passed
the
and
shouted
to
the
men
at
work
who
were
he
could
see
carrying
sheaves
of
arrows
and
bundles
of
javelins
from
the
vessel
and
placing
them
on
carts
but
they
did
not
trouble
to
reply
his
common
dress
and
ordinary
appearance
did
not
inspire
them
with
any
hope
of
payment
from
him
if
they
obliged
him
with
a
boat
the
utter
indifference
with
which
his
approach
was
seen
showed
him
the
contempt
in
which
he
was
held
looking
round
to
see
if
there
were
no
bridge
or
ferry
he
caught
sight
of
the
grey
church
tower
which
he
had
observed
from
afar
while
sailing
it
was
quite
a
mile
from
the
city
and
isolated
outside
the
walls
it
stood
on
the
slope
of
the
hill
over
whose
summit
the
tower
was
visible
he
wandered
up
towards
it
as
there
were
usually
people
in
or
about
the
churches
which
were
always
open
day
and
night
if
no
one
else
the
porter
in
the
lodge
at
the
church
door
would
be
there
for
he
or
his
representative
never
left
it
being
always
on
the
watch
lest
some
thief
should
attempt
to
enter
the
treasury
or
steal
the
sacred
vessels
but
as
he
ascended
the
hill
he
met
a
shepherd
whose
dogs
prepared
to
fly
at
him
recognising
a
stranger
for
a
moment
the
man
seemed
inclined
to
let
them
wreak
their
will
if
they
could
for
he
also
felt
inclined
to
challenge
a
stranger
but
seeing
felix
lower
his
spear
it
probably
occurred
to
him
that
some
of
his
dogs
would
be
killed
he
therefore
ordered
them
down
and
stayed
to
listen
felix
learnt
that
there
was
no
bridge
across
the
creek
and
only
one
over
the
river
but
there
was
a
ferry
for
anybody
who
was
known
no
strangers
were
allowed
to
cross
the
ferry
they
must
enter
by
the
main
road
over
the
bridge
but
how
am
i
to
get
into
the
place
then
said
felix
the
shepherd
shook
his
head
and
said
he
could
not
tell
him
and
walked
away
about
his
business
discouraged
at
these
trifling
vexations
which
seemed
to
cross
his
path
at
every
step
felix
found
his
way
to
the
ferry
but
as
the
shepherd
had
said
the
boatman
refused
to
carry
him
being
a
stranger
no
persuasion
could
move
him
nor
the
offer
of
a
small
silver
coin
worth
about
ten
times
his
fare
i
must
then
swim
across
said
felix
preparing
to
take
off
his
clothes
swim
if
you
like
said
the
boatman
with
a
grim
smile
but
you
will
never
land
why
not
because
the
warder
will
let
drive
at
you
with
an
arrow
felix
looked
and
saw
that
he
was
opposite
the
extreme
angle
of
the
city
wall
a
point
usually
guarded
with
care
there
was
a
warder
stalking
to
and
fro
he
carried
a
partisan
but
of
course
might
have
his
bow
within
reach
or
could
probably
call
to
the
soldiers
of
the
guard
this
annoying
said
felix
ready
to
give
up
his
enterprise
how
ever
can
i
get
into
the
city
the
old
boatman
grinned
but
said
nothing
and
returned
to
a
net
which
he
was
mending
he
made
no
answer
to
the
further
questions
felix
put
to
him
felix
then
shouted
to
the
warder
the
soldier
looked
once
but
paid
no
more
heed
felix
walked
a
little
way
and
sat
down
on
the
grass
he
was
deeply
discouraged
these
repulses
trifles
in
themselves
assumed
an
importance
because
his
mind
had
long
been
strung
up
to
a
high
pitch
of
tension
a
stolid
man
would
have
thought
nothing
of
them
after
a
while
he
arose
again
asking
himself
how
should
he
become
a
leader
who
had
not
the
perseverance
to
enter
a
city
in
peaceful
guise
not
knowing
what
else
to
do
he
followed
the
creek
round
the
foot
of
the
hill
and
so
onwards
for
a
mile
or
more
this
bank
was
steep
on
account
of
the
down
the
other
cultivated
the
corn
being
already
high
the
cuckoo
sang
she
loves
the
near
neighbourhood
of
man
and
flew
over
the
channel
towards
a
little
copse
almost
suddenly
the
creek
wound
round
under
a
low
chalk
cliff
and
in
a
moment
felix
found
himself
confronted
by
another
city
this
had
no
wall
it
was
merely
defended
by
a
ditch
and
earthwork
without
tower
or
bastion
the
houses
were
placed
thickly
together
there
were
he
thought
six
or
seven
times
as
many
as
he
had
previously
seen
and
they
were
thatched
or
shingled
like
those
in
his
own
country
it
stood
in
the
midst
of
the
fields
and
the
corn
came
up
to
the
fosse
there
were
many
people
at
work
but
as
he
noticed
most
of
them
were
old
men
bowed
and
feeble
a
little
way
farther
he
saw
a
second
boathouse
he
hastened
thither
and
the
ferrywoman
for
the
boat
was
poled
across
by
a
stout
dame
made
not
the
least
difficulty
about
ferrying
him
over
so
delighted
was
felix
at
this
unexpected
fortune
that
he
gave
her
the
small
silver
coin
at
sight
of
which
he
instantly
rose
high
in
her
estimation
she
explained
to
him
in
answer
to
his
inquiries
that
this
was
also
called
aisi
this
was
the
city
of
the
common
folk
those
who
were
rich
or
powerful
had
houses
in
the
walled
city
the
precinct
of
the
court
many
of
the
houses
there
too
were
the
inns
of
great
families
who
dwelt
in
the
country
in
their
castles
but
when
they
came
to
the
court
required
a
house
their
shields
or
coats
of
arms
were
painted
over
the
doors
the
walled
city
was
guarded
with
such
care
because
so
many
attempts
had
been
made
to
surprise
it
and
to
assassinate
the
king
whose
fiery
disposition
and
constant
wars
had
raised
him
up
so
many
enemies
as
much
care
was
taken
to
prevent
a
single
stranger
entering
as
if
he
were
the
vanguard
of
a
hostile
army
and
if
he
now
went
back
as
he
could
do
to
the
bridge
over
the
river
he
would
be
stopped
and
questioned
and
possibly
confined
in
prison
till
the
king
returned
where
is
the
king
asked
felix
i
came
to
try
and
take
service
with
him
then
you
will
be
welcome
said
the
woman
he
is
in
the
field
and
has
just
sat
down
before
iwis
that
was
why
the
walled
city
seemed
so
empty
then
said
felix
yes
all
the
people
are
with
him
there
will
be
a
great
battle
this
time
how
far
is
it
to
iwis
said
felix
miles
replied
the
dame
and
if
you
take
my
advice
you
had
better
walk
miles
there
than
two
miles
back
to
the
bridge
over
the
river
someone
now
called
from
the
opposite
bank
and
she
started
with
the
boat
to
fetch
another
passenger
thank
you
very
much
said
felix
as
he
wished
her
good
day
but
why
did
not
the
man
at
the
other
ferry
tell
me
i
could
cross
here
the
woman
laughed
outright
do
you
suppose
he
was
going
to
put
a
penny
in
my
way
when
he
could
not
get
it
himself
so
mean
and
petty
is
the
world
felix
entered
the
second
city
and
walked
some
distance
through
it
when
he
recollected
that
he
had
not
eaten
for
some
time
he
looked
in
vain
for
an
inn
but
upon
speaking
to
a
man
who
was
leaning
on
his
crutch
at
a
doorway
he
was
at
once
asked
to
enter
and
all
that
the
house
afforded
was
put
before
him
the
man
with
the
crutch
sat
down
opposite
and
remarked
that
most
of
the
folk
were
gone
to
the
camp
but
he
could
not
because
his
foot
had
been
injured
he
then
went
on
to
tell
how
it
had
happened
with
the
usual
garrulity
of
the
wounded
he
was
assisting
to
place
the
beam
of
a
upon
a
truck
it
took
ten
horses
to
draw
it
when
a
lever
snapped
and
the
beam
fell
had
the
beam
itself
touched
him
he
would
have
been
killed
on
the
spot
as
it
was
only
a
part
of
the
broken
lever
or
pole
hit
him
thrown
with
such
force
the
weight
of
the
ram
driving
it
the
fragment
of
the
pole
grazed
his
leg
and
either
broke
one
of
the
small
bones
that
form
the
arch
of
the
instep
or
so
bruised
it
that
it
was
worse
than
broken
all
the
and
surgeons
had
gone
to
the
camp
and
he
was
left
without
attendance
other
than
the
women
who
fomented
the
foot
daily
but
he
had
little
hope
of
present
recovery
knowing
that
such
things
were
often
months
about
he
thought
it
lucky
that
it
was
no
worse
for
very
few
he
had
noticed
ever
recovered
from
serious
wounds
of
spear
or
arrow
the
wounded
generally
died
only
the
fortunate
escaped
thus
he
ran
on
talking
as
much
for
his
own
amusement
as
that
of
his
guest
he
fretted
because
he
could
not
join
the
camp
and
help
work
the
artillery
he
supposed
the
ram
would
be
in
position
by
now
and
shaking
the
wall
with
its
blow
he
wondered
if
baron
ingulph
would
miss
his
face
who
he
asked
felix
he
is
captain
of
the
artillery
replied
his
host
are
you
his
retainer
no
i
am
a
servant
felix
started
slightly
and
did
but
just
check
himself
from
rising
from
the
table
a
servant
was
a
slave
it
was
the
euphemism
used
instead
of
the
hateful
word
which
not
even
the
most
degraded
can
endure
to
bear
the
class
of
the
nobles
to
which
he
belonged
deemed
it
a
disgrace
to
sit
down
with
a
slave
to
eat
with
him
even
to
accidently
touch
him
with
the
retainers
or
free
men
they
were
on
familiar
terms
though
despotic
to
the
last
degree
the
slave
was
less
than
the
dog
then
stealing
a
glance
at
the
man
face
felix
saw
that
he
had
no
moustache
he
had
not
noticed
this
before
no
slaves
were
allowed
to
wear
the
moustache
this
man
having
been
at
home
ill
some
days
had
neglected
to
shave
and
there
was
some
mark
upon
his
upper
lip
as
he
caught
his
guest
glance
the
slave
hung
his
head
and
asked
his
guest
in
a
low
and
humble
voice
not
to
mention
this
fault
with
his
face
slightly
flushed
felix
finished
his
meal
he
was
confused
to
the
last
degree
his
long
training
and
the
tone
of
the
society
in
which
he
had
moved
though
so
despised
a
member
of
it
prejudiced
him
strongly
against
the
man
whose
hospitality
was
so
welcome
on
the
other
hand
the
ideas
which
had
for
so
long
worked
in
his
mind
in
his
solitary
intercommunings
in
the
forest
were
entirely
opposed
to
servitude
in
abstract
principle
he
had
long
since
condemned
it
and
desired
to
abolish
it
but
here
was
the
fact
he
had
eaten
at
a
slave
table
and
sat
with
him
face
to
face
theory
and
practice
are
often
strangely
at
variance
he
felt
it
an
important
moment
he
felt
that
he
was
himself
as
it
were
on
the
balance
should
he
adhere
to
the
ancient
prejudice
the
ancient
exclusiveness
of
his
class
or
should
he
boldly
follow
the
dictate
of
his
mind
he
chose
the
latter
and
extended
his
hand
to
the
servant
as
he
rose
to
say
the
act
was
significant
it
recognised
man
as
distinct
from
caste
the
servant
did
not
know
the
conflict
that
had
taken
place
but
to
be
shaken
hands
with
at
all
even
by
a
retainer
as
he
supposed
felix
to
be
was
indeed
a
surprise
he
could
not
understand
it
it
was
the
first
time
his
hand
had
been
taken
by
any
one
of
superior
position
since
he
had
been
born
he
was
dumb
with
amazement
and
could
scarcely
point
out
the
road
when
asked
nor
did
he
take
the
small
coin
felix
offered
one
of
the
few
he
possessed
felix
therefore
left
it
on
the
table
and
again
started
passing
through
the
town
felix
followed
the
track
which
led
in
the
direction
indicated
in
about
half
a
mile
it
led
him
to
a
wider
track
which
he
immediately
recognised
as
the
main
way
and
road
to
the
camp
by
the
ruts
and
dust
for
the
sward
had
been
trampled
down
for
fifty
yards
wide
and
even
the
corn
was
cut
up
by
wheels
and
horses
hoofs
the
army
had
passed
and
he
had
but
to
follow
its
unmistakable
trail
chapter
xvii
the
camp
felix
walked
steadily
on
for
nearly
three
hours
when
the
rough
track
the
dust
and
heat
began
to
tell
upon
him
and
he
sat
down
beside
the
way
the
sun
was
now
declining
and
the
long
june
day
tending
to
its
end
a
horseman
passed
coming
from
the
camp
and
as
he
wore
only
a
sword
and
had
a
leathern
bag
slung
from
his
shoulder
he
appeared
to
be
a
courtier
the
dust
raised
by
the
hoofs
as
it
rose
and
floated
above
the
brushwood
rendered
his
course
visible
some
time
afterwards
while
he
still
rested
being
very
weary
with
walking
through
the
heat
of
the
afternoon
he
heard
the
sound
of
wheels
and
two
carts
drawn
by
horses
came
along
the
track
from
the
city
the
carts
were
laden
with
bundles
of
arrows
perhaps
the
same
he
had
seen
unloading
that
morning
from
the
and
were
accompanied
only
by
carters
as
they
approached
he
rose
feeling
that
it
was
time
to
continue
his
journey
his
tired
feet
were
now
stiff
and
he
limped
as
he
stepped
out
into
the
road
the
men
spoke
and
he
walked
as
well
as
he
could
beside
them
using
his
as
a
staff
there
were
two
carters
with
each
cart
and
presently
noting
how
he
lagged
and
could
scarce
keep
pace
with
them
one
of
them
took
a
wooden
bottle
from
the
load
on
his
cart
and
offered
him
a
draught
of
ale
thus
somewhat
refreshed
felix
began
to
talk
and
learnt
that
the
arrows
were
from
the
vessel
in
whose
track
he
had
sailed
that
it
had
been
sent
loaded
with
stores
for
the
king
use
by
his
friend
the
prince
of
quinton
that
very
great
efforts
had
been
made
to
get
together
a
large
army
in
this
campaign
first
because
the
city
besieged
was
so
near
home
and
failure
might
be
disastrous
and
secondly
because
it
was
one
of
three
which
were
all
republics
and
the
other
two
would
be
certain
to
send
it
assistance
these
cities
stood
in
a
plain
but
a
few
miles
apart
and
in
a
straight
line
on
the
banks
of
the
river
the
king
had
just
sat
down
before
the
first
vowing
that
he
would
knock
them
down
one
after
the
other
like
a
row
of
ninepins
the
carters
asked
him
in
return
whose
retainer
he
was
and
he
said
that
he
was
on
his
way
to
take
service
and
was
under
no
banner
yet
then
said
the
man
who
had
given
him
a
drink
if
you
are
free
like
that
you
had
better
join
the
king
levy
and
be
careful
to
avoid
the
barons
war
for
if
you
join
either
of
the
barons
war
they
will
know
you
to
be
a
stranger
and
very
likely
if
they
see
that
you
are
quick
and
active
they
will
not
let
you
free
again
and
if
you
attempt
to
escape
after
the
campaign
you
will
find
yourself
mightily
mistaken
the
baron
captain
would
only
have
to
say
you
had
always
been
his
man
and
as
for
your
word
it
would
be
no
more
than
a
dog
bark
besides
which
if
you
rebelled
it
would
be
only
to
shave
off
that
moustache
of
yours
and
declare
you
a
slave
and
as
you
have
no
friends
in
camp
a
slave
you
would
be
that
would
be
very
unjust
said
felix
surely
the
king
would
not
allow
it
how
is
he
to
know
said
another
of
the
carters
my
brother
boy
was
served
just
like
that
he
was
born
free
the
same
as
all
our
family
but
he
was
fond
of
roving
and
when
he
reached
quinton
he
was
seen
by
baron
robert
who
was
in
want
of
men
and
being
a
likely
young
fellow
they
shaved
his
lip
and
forced
him
to
labour
under
the
thong
when
his
spirit
was
cowed
and
he
seemed
reconciled
they
let
him
grow
his
moustache
again
and
there
he
is
now
a
retainer
and
well
treated
but
still
it
was
against
his
will
jack
is
right
you
had
better
join
the
king
levy
the
king
levy
is
composed
of
his
own
retainers
from
his
estates
of
townsmen
who
are
not
retainers
of
the
barons
of
any
knights
and
volunteers
who
like
to
offer
their
services
and
a
king
always
desires
as
large
a
levy
as
possible
because
it
enables
him
to
overawe
his
barons
these
when
their
war
or
forces
are
collected
together
in
camp
are
often
troublesome
and
inclined
to
usurp
authority
a
volunteer
is
therefore
always
welcome
in
the
king
levy
felix
thanked
them
for
the
information
they
had
given
him
and
said
he
should
certainly
follow
their
advice
he
could
now
hardly
keep
up
with
the
carts
having
walked
for
so
many
hours
and
undergone
so
much
previous
exertion
finding
this
to
be
the
case
he
wished
them
and
looked
round
for
some
cover
it
was
now
dusk
and
he
knew
he
could
go
no
farther
when
they
understood
his
intention
they
consulted
among
themselves
and
finally
made
him
get
up
into
one
of
the
carts
and
sit
down
on
the
bundles
of
arrows
which
filled
it
like
faggots
thus
he
was
jolted
along
the
rude
wheels
fitting
but
badly
on
the
axle
and
often
sinking
deep
into
a
rut
they
were
now
in
thick
forest
and
the
track
was
much
narrower
so
that
it
had
become
worn
into
a
hollow
as
if
it
were
the
dry
bed
of
a
torrent
the
horses
and
the
carters
were
weary
yet
they
were
obliged
to
plod
on
as
the
arms
had
to
be
delivered
before
the
morrow
they
spoke
little
except
to
urge
the
animals
felix
soon
dropped
into
a
reclining
posture
uneasy
as
it
was
it
was
a
relief
and
looking
up
saw
the
white
summer
stars
above
after
a
time
he
lost
consciousness
and
slept
soundly
quite
worn
out
despite
the
jolting
and
creaking
of
the
wheels
the
sound
of
a
trumpet
woke
him
with
a
start
his
heavy
and
dreamless
sleep
for
a
moment
had
taken
away
his
memory
and
he
did
not
know
where
he
was
as
he
sat
up
two
sacks
fell
from
him
the
carters
had
thrown
them
over
him
as
a
protection
against
the
night
dew
the
summer
morning
was
already
as
bright
as
noonday
and
the
camp
about
him
was
astir
in
half
a
minute
he
came
to
himself
and
getting
out
of
the
cart
looked
round
all
his
old
interest
had
returned
the
spirit
of
war
entered
into
him
the
trumpet
sounded
again
and
the
morning
breeze
extended
the
banners
the
spot
where
he
stood
was
in
the
rear
of
the
main
camp
and
but
a
short
distance
from
the
unbroken
forest
upon
either
hand
there
was
an
intermingled
mass
of
stores
carts
and
waggons
crowded
together
sacks
and
huge
heaps
of
forage
on
and
about
which
scores
of
slaves
drivers
and
others
were
sleeping
in
every
possible
attitude
many
of
them
evidently
still
under
the
influence
of
the
ale
they
had
drunk
the
night
before
what
struck
him
at
once
was
the
absence
of
any
guard
here
in
the
rear
the
enemy
might
steal
out
from
the
forest
behind
and
help
himself
to
what
he
chose
or
murder
the
sleeping
men
or
passing
through
the
stores
fall
on
the
camp
itself
to
felix
this
neglect
appeared
inexplicable
it
indicated
a
mental
state
which
he
could
not
comprehend
a
state
only
to
be
described
by
negatives
there
was
no
completeness
no
system
no
organization
it
was
a
kind
of
haphazardness
altogether
opposite
to
his
own
clear
and
ideas
the
ground
sloped
gently
downwards
from
the
edge
of
the
forest
and
the
place
where
he
was
had
probably
been
ploughed
but
was
now
trodden
flat
and
hard
next
in
front
of
the
stores
he
observed
a
long
low
hut
built
of
poles
and
roofed
with
fir
branches
the
walls
were
formed
of
ferns
straw
bundles
of
hay
anything
that
had
come
to
hand
on
a
standard
beside
it
a
pale
blue
banner
with
the
device
of
a
double
hammer
worked
in
gold
upon
it
fluttered
in
the
wind
twenty
or
thirty
perhaps
more
spears
leant
against
one
end
of
this
rude
shed
their
bright
points
projecting
yards
above
the
roof
to
the
right
of
the
booth
as
many
horses
were
picketed
and
not
far
from
them
some
soldiers
were
cooking
at
an
open
fire
of
logs
as
felix
came
slowly
towards
the
booth
winding
in
and
out
among
the
carts
and
heaps
of
sacks
he
saw
that
similar
erections
extended
down
the
slope
for
a
long
distance
there
were
hundreds
of
them
some
large
some
small
not
placed
in
any
order
but
pitched
where
chance
or
fancy
led
the
taking
the
sites
that
pleased
them
and
the
rest
crowding
round
beside
each
hut
stood
the
banner
of
the
owner
and
felix
knew
from
this
that
they
were
occupied
by
the
barons
knights
and
captains
of
the
army
the
retainers
of
each
baron
bivouacked
as
they
might
in
the
open
air
some
of
them
had
hunter
hides
and
others
used
bundles
of
straw
to
sleep
on
their
fire
was
as
close
to
their
lord
hut
as
convenient
and
thus
there
were
always
plenty
within
call
the
servants
or
slaves
also
slept
in
the
open
air
but
in
the
rear
of
their
owner
booth
and
apart
from
the
free
retainers
felix
noticed
that
although
the
huts
were
pitched
anyhow
and
anywhere
those
on
the
lowest
ground
seemed
built
along
a
line
and
looking
closer
he
found
that
a
small
stream
ran
there
he
learnt
afterwards
that
there
was
usually
an
emulation
among
the
commanders
to
set
up
their
standards
as
near
the
water
as
possible
on
account
of
convenience
those
in
the
rear
having
often
to
lead
their
horses
a
long
distance
to
water
beyond
the
stream
the
ground
rose
again
as
gradually
as
it
had
declined
it
was
open
and
cultivated
up
to
the
walls
of
the
besieged
city
which
was
not
of
a
mile
distant
felix
could
not
for
the
moment
distinguish
the
king
the
confused
manner
in
which
the
booths
were
built
prevented
him
from
seeing
far
though
from
the
higher
ground
it
was
easy
to
look
over
their
low
roofs
he
now
wandered
into
the
centre
of
the
camp
and
saw
with
astonishment
groups
of
retainers
everywhere
eating
drinking
talking
and
even
playing
cards
or
dice
but
not
a
single
officer
of
any
rank
at
last
stopping
by
the
embers
of
a
fire
he
asked
timidly
if
he
might
have
breakfast
the
soldiers
laughed
and
pointed
to
a
cart
behind
them
telling
him
to
help
himself
the
cart
was
turned
with
the
tail
towards
the
fire
and
laden
with
bread
and
sides
of
bacon
slices
of
which
the
retainers
had
been
toasting
at
the
embers
he
did
as
he
was
bid
and
the
next
minute
a
soldier
not
quite
steady
on
his
legs
even
at
that
hour
offered
him
the
can
for
said
he
you
had
best
drink
whilst
you
may
youngster
there
is
always
plenty
of
drink
and
good
living
at
the
beginning
of
a
war
and
very
often
not
a
drop
or
a
bite
to
be
got
in
the
middle
of
it
listening
to
their
talk
as
he
ate
his
breakfast
felix
found
the
reason
there
were
no
officers
about
was
because
most
of
them
had
drunk
too
freely
the
night
before
the
king
himself
they
said
was
put
to
bed
as
tight
as
a
drum
and
it
took
no
small
quantity
to
fill
so
huge
a
vessel
for
he
was
a
remarkably
big
man
after
the
fatigue
of
the
recent
march
they
had
in
fact
refreshed
themselves
and
washed
down
the
dust
of
the
track
they
thought
that
this
siege
was
likely
to
be
a
very
tough
business
and
congratulated
themselves
that
it
was
not
thirty
miles
to
aisi
so
that
so
long
as
they
stayed
there
they
might
perhaps
get
supplies
of
provisions
with
tolerable
regularity
but
if
you
over
the
water
my
lad
said
the
old
fellow
with
the
can
picking
his
teeth
with
a
twig
and
have
got
to
get
your
victuals
by
ship
by
george
you
may
have
to
eat
grass
or
gnaw
boughs
like
a
horse
none
of
these
men
wore
any
arms
except
the
inevitable
knife
their
arms
were
piled
against
the
adjacent
booth
bows
and
quivers
spears
swords
bills
and
darts
thrown
together
just
as
they
had
cast
them
aside
and
more
or
less
rusty
from
the
dew
felix
thought
that
had
the
enemy
come
suddenly
down
in
force
they
might
have
made
a
clean
sweep
of
the
camp
for
there
were
no
defences
neither
breastwork
nor
fosse
nor
any
set
guard
but
he
forgot
that
the
enemy
were
quite
as
as
the
besiegers
probably
they
were
in
still
greater
confusion
for
king
isembard
was
considered
one
of
the
greatest
military
commanders
of
his
age
if
not
the
very
greatest
the
only
sign
of
discipline
he
saw
was
the
careful
grooming
of
some
horses
which
he
rightly
guessed
to
be
those
ridden
by
the
knights
and
the
equally
careful
polishing
of
pieces
of
armour
before
the
doors
of
the
huts
he
wished
now
to
inquire
his
way
to
the
king
levy
but
as
the
question
rose
to
his
lips
he
checked
himself
remembering
the
caution
the
friendly
carters
had
given
him
he
therefore
determined
to
walk
about
the
camp
till
he
found
some
evidence
that
he
was
in
the
immediate
neighbourhood
of
the
king
he
rose
stood
about
a
little
while
to
allay
any
possible
suspicion
quite
needless
precautions
for
the
soldiers
were
far
too
agreeably
engaged
to
take
the
least
notice
of
him
and
then
sauntered
off
with
as
careless
an
air
as
he
could
assume
looking
about
him
first
at
a
forge
where
the
blacksmith
was
shoeing
a
horse
then
at
a
grindstone
where
a
knight
sword
was
being
sharpened
he
was
nearly
knocked
down
by
a
horse
urged
at
some
speed
through
the
crowds
by
a
rope
from
the
collar
three
dead
bodies
were
drawn
along
the
ground
dusty
and
disfigured
by
bumping
against
stone
and
clod
they
were
those
of
slaves
hanged
the
preceding
day
perhaps
for
pilfering
perhaps
for
a
mere
whim
since
every
baron
had
power
of
the
gallows
they
were
dragged
through
the
camp
and
out
a
few
hundred
yards
beyond
and
there
left
to
the
crows
this
horrible
sight
to
which
the
rest
were
so
accustomed
and
so
indifferent
that
they
did
not
even
turn
to
look
at
it
deeply
shocked
him
the
drawn
and
distorted
features
the
tongues
protruding
and
literally
licking
the
dust
haunted
him
for
long
after
though
his
father
as
a
baron
possessed
the
same
power
it
had
never
been
exercised
during
his
tenure
of
the
estate
so
that
felix
had
not
been
hardened
to
the
sight
of
executions
common
enough
elsewhere
upon
the
old
house
estate
a
species
of
negative
humanity
reigned
if
the
slaves
were
not
emancipated
they
were
not
hanged
or
cruelly
beaten
for
trifles
hastening
from
the
spot
felix
came
across
the
artillery
which
consisted
of
battering
rams
and
immense
crossbows
the
bows
were
made
from
entire
trees
or
more
properly
poles
he
inspected
these
clumsy
contrivances
with
interest
and
entered
into
a
conversation
with
some
men
who
were
fitting
up
the
framework
on
which
a
battering
ram
was
to
swing
being
extremely
conceited
with
themselves
and
the
knowledge
they
had
acquired
from
experience
only
as
the
repeated
blows
of
the
block
drive
home
the
pile
they
scarcely
answered
him
but
presently
as
he
lent
a
hand
to
assist
and
bore
with
their
churlishness
without
reply
they
softened
and
as
usual
asked
him
to
drink
for
here
and
throughout
the
camp
the
ale
was
plentiful
too
plentiful
for
much
progress
felix
took
the
opportunity
and
suggested
a
new
form
of
trigger
for
the
unwieldy
crossbows
he
saw
that
as
at
present
discharged
it
must
require
some
strength
perhaps
the
united
effort
of
several
men
to
pull
away
the
bolt
or
catch
such
an
effort
must
disconcert
the
aim
these
crossbows
were
worked
upon
a
carriage
and
it
was
difficult
to
keep
the
carriage
steady
even
when
stakes
were
inserted
by
the
low
wheels
it
occurred
to
him
at
once
that
the
catch
could
be
depressed
by
a
lever
so
that
one
man
could
discharge
the
bow
by
a
mere
pressure
of
the
hand
and
without
interfering
with
the
aim
the
men
soon
understood
him
and
acknowledged
that
it
would
be
a
great
improvement
one
who
was
the
leader
of
the
gang
thought
it
so
valuable
an
idea
that
he
went
off
at
once
to
communicate
with
the
lieutenant
who
would
in
his
turn
carry
the
matter
to
baron
ingulph
master
of
the
artillery
the
others
congratulated
him
and
asked
to
share
in
the
reward
that
would
be
given
to
him
for
this
invention
to
whose
war
did
he
belong
felix
answered
after
a
little
hesitation
to
the
king
levy
at
this
they
whispered
among
themselves
and
felix
again
remembering
the
carters
caution
said
that
he
must
attend
the
muster
this
was
a
pure
guess
but
that
he
would
return
directly
afterwards
never
for
a
moment
suspecting
that
he
would
avoid
the
reward
they
looked
upon
as
certain
they
made
no
opposition
and
he
hurried
away
pushing
through
the
groups
and
not
in
the
least
knowing
where
he
was
going
felix
stumbled
at
last
upon
the
king
quarters
chapter
xviii
the
king
levy
the
king
booth
stood
apart
from
the
rest
it
was
not
much
larger
but
properly
thatched
with
straw
and
the
wide
doorway
hung
with
purple
curtains
two
standards
stood
beside
it
one
much
higher
than
the
other
the
tallest
bore
the
ensign
of
the
kingdom
the
lesser
the
king
own
private
banner
as
a
knight
a
breastwork
encircled
the
booth
enclosing
a
space
about
seventy
yards
in
diameter
with
a
fosse
and
stakes
so
planted
as
to
repel
assailants
there
was
but
one
gateway
opposite
the
general
camp
and
this
was
guarded
by
soldiers
fully
armed
a
knight
on
horseback
in
armour
except
his
helmet
rode
slowly
up
and
down
before
the
gate
he
was
the
officer
of
the
guard
his
retainers
some
thirty
or
forty
men
were
drawn
up
close
by
a
distance
of
fifty
yards
intervened
between
this
entrenchment
and
the
camp
and
was
kept
clear
within
the
entrenchment
felix
could
see
a
number
of
gentlemen
and
several
horses
caparisoned
but
from
the
absence
of
noise
and
the
fact
that
every
one
appeared
to
walk
daintily
and
on
tiptoe
he
concluded
that
the
king
was
still
sleeping
the
stream
ran
beside
the
entrenchment
and
between
it
and
the
city
the
quarters
were
at
that
corner
of
the
camp
highest
up
the
brook
so
that
the
water
might
not
be
fouled
before
it
reached
him
the
king
levy
however
did
not
seem
to
be
hereabouts
for
the
booths
nearest
the
were
evidently
occupied
by
great
barons
as
felix
easily
knew
from
their
banners
there
was
here
some
little
appearance
of
formality
the
soldiery
were
not
so
noisy
and
there
were
several
officers
moving
among
them
he
afterwards
discovered
that
the
greater
barons
claimed
the
right
to
camp
nearest
the
king
and
that
the
king
levy
was
just
behind
their
booths
but
unable
to
discover
the
place
and
afraid
of
losing
his
liberty
if
he
delayed
longer
felix
after
hesitating
some
time
determined
to
apply
direct
to
the
guard
at
the
gate
of
the
circular
entrenchment
as
he
crossed
the
open
ground
towards
it
he
noticed
that
the
quarters
were
the
closest
to
the
enemy
across
the
little
stream
were
some
and
beyond
these
the
walls
of
the
city
scarcely
half
a
mile
distant
there
was
no
outpost
the
stream
was
but
a
brook
and
could
be
crossed
with
ease
he
marvelled
at
the
lack
of
precaution
but
he
had
yet
to
learn
that
the
enemy
and
all
the
armies
of
the
age
were
equally
ignorant
and
equally
careless
with
as
humble
a
demeanour
as
he
could
assume
felix
doffed
his
cap
and
began
to
speak
to
the
guard
at
the
gateway
of
the
entrenchment
the
nearest
immediately
raised
his
spear
and
struck
him
with
the
butt
the
unexpected
blow
fell
on
his
left
shoulder
and
with
such
force
as
to
render
it
powerless
before
he
could
utter
a
remonstrance
a
second
had
seized
his
snapped
the
handle
across
his
knee
and
hurled
the
fragments
from
him
others
then
took
him
by
the
shoulders
and
thrust
him
back
across
the
open
space
to
the
camp
where
they
kicked
him
and
left
him
bruised
and
almost
stupefied
with
indignation
his
offence
was
approaching
the
king
ground
with
arms
in
his
hands
later
in
the
afternoon
he
found
himself
sitting
on
the
bank
of
the
stream
far
below
the
camp
he
had
wandered
thither
without
knowing
where
he
was
going
or
what
he
was
doing
his
spirit
for
the
time
had
been
crushed
not
so
much
by
the
physical
brutality
as
by
the
repulse
to
his
aspirations
full
of
high
hopes
and
conscious
of
great
ideas
he
had
been
beaten
like
a
felon
hound
from
this
spot
beside
the
brook
the
distant
camp
appeared
very
beautiful
the
fluttering
banners
the
green
roofs
of
the
booths
of
ferns
and
reeds
and
boughs
the
movement
and
life
for
bodies
of
troops
were
now
marching
to
and
fro
and
knights
in
gay
attire
riding
on
horseback
made
a
pleasant
scene
on
the
sloping
ground
with
the
forest
at
the
back
over
the
stream
the
sunshine
lit
up
the
walls
of
the
threatened
city
where
too
many
flags
were
waving
felix
came
somewhat
to
himself
as
he
gazed
and
presently
acknowledged
that
he
had
only
had
himself
to
blame
he
had
evidently
transgressed
a
rule
and
his
ignorance
of
the
rule
was
no
excuse
since
those
who
had
any
right
to
be
in
the
camp
at
all
were
supposed
to
understand
it
he
got
up
and
returning
slowly
towards
the
camp
passed
on
his
way
the
where
a
groom
was
watering
some
horses
the
man
called
to
him
to
help
hold
a
spirited
charger
and
felix
mechanically
did
as
he
was
asked
the
fellow
mates
had
left
him
to
do
their
work
and
there
were
too
many
horses
for
him
to
manage
felix
led
the
charger
for
him
back
to
the
camp
and
in
return
was
asked
to
drink
he
preferred
food
and
a
plentiful
supply
was
put
before
him
the
groom
gossiping
as
he
attended
to
his
duties
said
that
he
always
welcomed
the
beginning
of
a
war
for
they
were
often
half
starved
and
had
to
gnaw
the
bones
like
the
dogs
in
peace
but
when
war
was
declared
vast
quantities
of
provisions
were
got
together
and
everybody
gorged
at
their
will
the
very
dogs
battened
he
pointed
to
half
a
dozen
who
were
tearing
a
raw
shoulder
of
mutton
to
pieces
before
the
campaign
was
over
those
very
dogs
might
starve
to
what
war
did
felix
belong
he
replied
to
the
king
levy
the
groom
said
that
this
was
the
king
levy
where
they
were
but
under
whose
command
was
he
this
puzzled
felix
who
did
not
know
what
to
say
and
ended
by
telling
the
truth
and
begging
the
fellow
to
advise
him
as
he
feared
to
lose
his
liberty
the
man
said
he
had
better
stay
where
he
was
and
serve
with
him
under
master
lacy
who
was
mean
enough
in
the
city
but
liked
to
appear
liberal
when
thus
consorting
with
knights
and
gentlemen
master
lacy
was
a
merchant
of
aisi
an
owner
of
vessels
like
most
of
his
fellows
when
war
came
so
close
home
he
was
almost
obliged
to
join
the
king
levy
had
he
not
done
so
it
would
have
been
recorded
against
him
as
a
lack
of
loyalty
his
privileges
would
have
been
taken
from
him
possibly
the
wealth
he
had
accumulated
seized
and
himself
reduced
to
slavery
lacy
therefore
put
on
armour
and
accompanied
the
king
to
the
camp
thus
felix
after
all
his
aspirations
found
himself
serving
as
the
knave
of
a
mere
citizen
he
had
to
take
the
horses
down
to
water
to
scour
arms
to
fetch
wood
from
the
forest
for
the
fire
he
was
at
the
beck
and
call
of
all
the
other
men
who
never
scrupled
to
use
his
services
and
observing
that
he
never
refused
put
upon
him
all
the
more
on
the
other
hand
when
there
was
nothing
doing
they
were
very
kind
and
even
thoughtful
they
shared
the
best
with
him
brought
wine
occasionally
wine
was
scarce
though
ale
plentiful
as
a
delicacy
and
one
who
had
dexterously
taken
a
purse
presented
him
with
half
a
dozen
copper
coins
as
his
share
of
the
plunder
felix
grown
wiser
by
experience
did
not
dare
refuse
the
stolen
money
it
would
have
been
considered
as
the
greatest
insult
he
watched
his
opportunity
and
threw
it
away
the
men
of
course
quickly
discovered
his
superior
education
but
that
did
not
in
the
least
surprise
them
it
being
extremely
common
for
unfortunate
people
to
descend
by
degrees
to
menial
offices
if
once
they
left
the
estate
and
homestead
to
which
they
naturally
belonged
there
as
cadets
however
humble
they
were
certain
of
outward
respect
once
outside
the
influence
of
the
head
of
the
house
and
they
were
worse
off
than
the
lowest
retainer
his
fellows
would
have
resented
any
show
of
pride
and
would
speedily
have
made
his
life
intolerable
as
he
showed
none
they
almost
petted
him
but
at
the
same
time
expected
him
to
do
more
than
his
share
of
the
work
felix
listened
with
amazement
to
the
revelations
revelations
to
him
of
the
inner
life
of
the
camp
and
court
the
king
weaknesses
his
inordinate
gluttony
and
continual
intoxication
his
fits
of
temper
his
follies
and
foibles
seemed
as
familiar
to
these
grooms
as
if
they
had
dwelt
with
him
as
for
the
courtiers
and
barons
there
was
not
one
whose
vices
and
secret
crimes
were
not
perfectly
well
known
to
them
vice
and
crime
must
have
their
instruments
instruments
are
invariably
indiscreet
and
thus
secrets
escape
the
palace
intrigues
the
intrigues
with
other
states
the
influence
of
certain
women
there
was
nothing
which
they
did
not
know
seen
thus
from
below
the
whole
society
appeared
rotten
and
corrupted
coarse
to
the
last
degree
and
animated
only
by
the
lowest
motives
this
very
gossip
seemed
in
itself
criminal
to
felix
but
he
did
not
at
the
moment
reflect
that
it
was
but
the
tale
of
servants
had
such
language
been
used
by
gentlemen
then
it
would
have
been
treason
as
himself
of
noble
birth
felix
had
hitherto
seen
things
only
from
the
point
of
view
of
his
own
class
now
he
associated
with
grooms
he
began
to
see
society
from
point
of
view
and
recognised
how
feebly
it
was
held
together
by
brute
force
intrigue
cord
and
axe
and
woman
flattery
but
a
push
seemed
needed
to
overthrow
it
yet
it
was
quite
secure
nevertheless
as
there
was
none
to
give
that
push
and
if
any
such
plot
had
been
formed
those
very
slaves
who
suffered
the
most
would
have
been
the
very
men
to
give
information
and
to
torture
the
plotters
felix
had
never
dreamed
that
common
and
illiterate
men
such
as
these
grooms
and
retainers
could
have
any
conception
of
reasons
of
state
or
the
crafty
designs
of
courts
he
now
found
that
though
they
could
neither
writer
nor
read
they
had
learned
the
art
of
reading
man
the
worst
and
lowest
side
of
character
to
such
perfection
that
they
at
once
detected
the
motive
they
read
the
face
the
very
gait
and
gesture
gave
them
a
clue
they
read
man
in
fact
as
an
animal
they
understood
men
just
as
they
understood
the
horses
and
hounds
under
their
charge
every
mood
and
vicious
indication
in
those
animals
was
known
to
them
and
so
too
with
their
masters
felix
thought
that
he
was
himself
a
hunter
and
understood
woodcraft
he
now
found
how
mistaken
he
had
been
he
had
acquired
woodcraft
as
a
gentleman
he
now
learned
the
knave
woodcraft
they
taught
him
a
hundred
tricks
of
which
he
had
had
no
idea
they
stripped
man
of
his
dignity
and
nature
of
her
refinement
everything
had
a
blackguard
side
to
them
he
began
to
understand
that
high
principles
and
abstract
theories
were
only
words
with
the
mass
of
men
one
day
he
saw
a
knight
coolly
trip
up
a
citizen
one
of
the
levy
in
the
midst
of
the
camp
and
in
broad
daylight
and
quietly
cut
away
his
purse
at
least
a
score
of
persons
looking
on
but
they
were
only
retainers
and
slaves
there
was
no
one
whose
word
would
for
a
moment
have
been
received
against
the
knight
who
had
observed
this
and
plundered
the
citizen
with
impunity
he
flung
the
lesser
coins
to
the
crowd
keeping
the
gold
and
silver
for
himself
and
walked
off
amidst
their
plaudits
felix
saw
a
slave
nailed
to
a
tree
his
arms
put
round
it
so
as
to
clasp
it
and
then
nails
driven
through
them
there
he
was
left
in
his
agony
to
perish
no
one
knew
what
his
fault
had
been
his
master
had
simply
taken
a
dislike
to
him
a
guard
was
set
that
no
one
should
relieve
the
miserable
being
felix
horror
and
indignation
could
not
have
been
expressed
but
he
was
totally
helpless
his
own
condition
of
mind
during
this
time
was
such
as
could
not
be
well
analysed
he
did
not
himself
understand
whether
his
spirit
had
been
broken
whether
he
was
really
degraded
with
the
men
with
whom
he
lived
or
why
he
remained
with
them
though
there
were
moments
when
it
dawned
upon
him
that
this
education
rude
as
it
was
was
not
without
its
value
to
him
he
need
not
practise
these
evils
but
it
was
well
to
know
of
their
existence
thus
he
remained
as
it
were
quiescent
and
the
days
passed
on
he
really
had
not
much
to
do
although
the
rest
put
their
burdens
upon
him
for
discipline
was
so
lax
that
the
loosest
attendance
answered
equally
well
with
the
most
conscientious
the
one
thing
all
the
men
about
him
seemed
to
think
of
was
the
satisfying
of
their
appetites
the
one
thing
they
rejoiced
at
was
the
fine
dry
weather
for
as
his
mates
told
him
the
misery
of
camp
life
in
rain
was
almost
unendurable
chapter
xix
fighting
twice
felix
saw
the
king
once
there
was
a
review
of
the
horse
outside
the
camp
and
felix
having
to
attend
with
his
master
third
charger
a
mere
show
and
affectation
for
there
was
not
the
least
chance
of
his
needing
it
was
now
and
then
very
near
the
monarch
for
that
day
at
least
he
looked
every
whit
what
fame
had
reported
him
to
be
a
man
of
unusual
size
his
bulk
rendered
him
conspicuous
in
the
front
of
the
throng
his
massive
head
seemed
to
accord
well
with
the
possession
of
despotic
power
the
brow
was
a
little
bare
for
he
was
no
longer
young
but
the
back
of
his
head
was
covered
with
thick
ringlets
of
brown
hair
so
thick
as
to
partly
conceal
the
coronet
of
gold
which
he
wore
a
short
purple
cloak
scarcely
reaching
to
the
waist
was
thrown
back
off
his
shoulders
so
that
his
steel
corselet
glistened
in
the
sun
it
was
the
only
armour
he
had
on
a
long
sword
hung
at
his
side
he
rode
a
powerful
black
horse
full
eighteen
hands
high
by
far
the
finest
animal
on
the
ground
he
required
it
for
his
weight
must
have
been
great
felix
passed
near
enough
to
note
that
his
eyes
were
brown
and
the
expression
of
his
face
open
frank
and
pleasing
the
impression
left
upon
the
observer
was
that
of
a
strong
intellect
but
a
still
stronger
physique
which
latter
too
often
ran
away
with
and
controlled
the
former
no
one
could
look
upon
him
without
admiration
and
it
was
difficult
to
think
that
he
could
so
demean
himself
as
to
wallow
in
the
grossest
indulgence
as
for
the
review
though
it
was
a
brilliant
scene
felix
could
not
conceal
from
himself
that
these
gallant
knights
were
extremely
irregular
in
their
movements
and
not
one
single
evolution
was
performed
correctly
because
they
were
constantly
quarrelling
about
precedence
and
one
would
not
consent
to
follow
the
other
he
soon
understood
however
that
discipline
was
not
the
object
nor
regularity
considered
personal
courage
and
personal
dexterity
were
everything
this
review
was
the
prelude
to
active
operations
and
felix
now
hoped
to
have
some
practical
lessons
in
warfare
he
was
mistaken
instead
of
a
grand
assault
or
a
regular
approach
the
fighting
was
merely
a
series
of
combats
between
small
detachments
and
bodies
of
the
enemy
two
or
three
knights
with
their
retainers
and
slaves
would
start
forth
cross
the
stream
and
riding
right
past
the
besieged
city
endeavour
to
sack
some
small
hamlet
or
the
homestead
of
a
noble
from
the
city
a
sortie
would
ensue
sometimes
the
two
bodies
only
threatened
each
other
at
a
distance
the
first
retiring
as
the
second
advanced
sometimes
only
a
few
arrows
were
discharged
occasionally
they
came
to
blows
but
the
casualties
were
rarely
heavy
one
such
party
while
returning
was
followed
by
a
squadron
of
horsemen
from
the
town
towards
the
stream
to
within
three
hundred
yards
of
the
king
quarters
incensed
at
this
assurance
several
knights
mounted
their
horses
and
rode
out
to
reinforce
the
returning
detachment
which
was
loaded
with
booty
finding
themselves
about
to
be
supported
they
threw
down
their
spoils
faced
about
and
felix
saw
for
the
first
time
a
real
and
desperate
it
was
over
in
five
minutes
the
knights
far
better
horsed
and
filled
with
desire
to
exhibit
their
valour
to
the
camp
charged
with
such
fury
that
they
overthrew
the
enemy
and
rode
over
him
felix
saw
the
troops
meet
there
was
a
crash
and
cracking
as
the
lances
broke
four
or
five
rolled
from
the
saddle
on
the
trodden
corn
and
the
next
moment
the
entangled
mass
of
men
and
horses
unwound
itself
as
the
enemy
hastened
back
to
the
walls
felix
was
eager
to
join
in
such
an
affray
but
he
had
no
horse
nor
weapon
upon
another
occasion
early
one
bright
morning
four
knights
and
their
followers
about
forty
in
all
deliberately
set
out
from
the
camp
and
advanced
up
the
sloping
ground
towards
the
city
the
camp
was
soon
astir
watching
their
proceedings
and
the
king
being
made
acquainted
with
what
was
going
on
came
out
from
his
booth
felix
who
now
entered
the
circular
entrenchment
without
any
difficulty
got
up
on
the
mound
with
scores
of
others
where
holding
to
the
stakes
they
had
a
good
view
the
king
stood
on
a
bench
and
watched
the
troops
advance
shading
his
eyes
with
his
hand
as
it
was
but
half
a
mile
to
the
walls
they
could
see
all
that
took
place
when
the
knights
had
got
within
two
hundred
yards
and
arrows
began
to
drop
amongst
them
they
dismounted
from
their
horses
and
left
them
in
charge
of
the
grooms
who
walked
them
up
and
down
none
remaining
still
a
minute
so
as
to
escape
the
aim
of
the
enemy
archers
then
drawing
their
swords
the
knights
who
were
in
full
armour
put
themselves
at
the
head
of
the
band
and
advanced
at
a
steady
pace
to
the
wall
in
their
mail
with
their
shields
before
them
they
cared
not
for
such
feeble
archery
nor
even
for
the
darts
that
poured
upon
them
when
they
came
within
reach
there
was
no
fosse
to
the
wall
so
that
pushing
forward
they
were
soon
at
the
foot
so
easily
had
they
reached
it
that
felix
almost
thought
the
city
already
won
now
he
saw
blocks
of
stone
darts
and
beams
of
wood
cast
at
them
from
the
parapet
which
was
not
more
than
twelve
feet
above
the
ground
quite
undismayed
the
knights
set
up
their
ladders
of
which
they
had
but
four
one
each
the
held
these
by
main
force
against
the
wall
the
besiegers
trying
to
throw
them
away
and
chopping
at
the
rungs
with
their
axes
but
the
ladders
were
well
shod
with
iron
to
resist
such
blows
and
in
a
moment
felix
saw
with
intense
delight
and
admiration
the
four
knights
slowly
mount
to
the
parapet
and
cut
at
the
defenders
with
their
swords
the
gleam
of
steel
was
distinctly
visible
as
the
blades
rose
and
fell
the
enemy
thrust
at
them
with
pikes
but
seemed
to
shrink
from
closer
combat
and
a
moment
afterwards
the
gallant
four
stood
on
the
top
of
the
wall
their
figures
clad
in
mail
and
shield
in
hand
were
distinctly
seen
against
the
sky
up
swarmed
the
behind
them
and
some
seemed
to
descend
on
the
other
side
a
shout
rose
from
the
camp
and
echoed
over
the
woods
felix
shouted
with
the
rest
wild
with
excitement
the
next
minute
while
yet
the
knights
stood
on
the
wall
and
scarcely
seemed
to
know
what
to
do
next
there
appeared
at
least
a
dozen
men
in
armour
running
along
the
wall
towards
them
felix
afterwards
understood
that
the
ease
with
which
the
four
won
the
wall
at
first
was
owing
to
there
being
no
men
of
knightly
rank
among
the
defenders
at
that
early
hour
those
who
had
collected
to
repulse
the
assault
were
citizens
retainers
slaves
any
in
fact
who
had
been
near
but
now
the
news
had
reached
the
enemy
leaders
and
some
of
them
hastened
to
the
wall
as
these
were
seen
approaching
the
camp
was
hushed
and
every
eye
strained
on
the
combatants
the
noble
four
could
not
all
meet
their
assailants
the
wall
was
but
wide
enough
for
two
to
fight
but
the
other
two
had
work
enough
the
next
minute
as
eight
or
ten
more
men
in
mail
advanced
the
other
way
so
they
fought
back
to
back
two
facing
one
way
and
two
the
other
the
swords
rose
and
fell
felix
saw
a
flash
of
light
fly
up
into
the
air
it
was
the
point
of
a
sword
broken
off
short
at
the
foot
of
the
wall
the
men
who
had
not
had
time
to
mount
endeavoured
to
assist
their
masters
by
stabbing
upwards
with
their
spears
all
at
once
two
of
the
knights
were
hurled
from
the
wall
one
seemed
to
be
caught
by
his
men
the
other
came
heavily
to
the
ground
while
they
were
fighting
their
immediate
antagonists
others
within
the
wall
had
come
with
lances
and
literally
thrust
them
from
the
parapet
the
other
two
still
fought
back
to
back
for
a
moment
then
finding
themselves
overwhelmed
they
sprang
down
among
their
friends
the
minute
the
two
first
fell
the
grooms
with
the
horses
ran
towards
the
wall
and
despite
the
rain
of
arrows
darts
and
stones
from
the
parapet
felix
saw
with
relief
three
of
the
four
knights
placed
on
their
chargers
one
only
could
sit
upright
unassisted
two
were
supported
in
their
saddles
and
the
fourth
was
carried
by
his
retainers
thus
they
retreated
and
apparently
without
further
hurt
for
the
enemy
on
the
wall
crowded
so
much
together
as
to
interfere
with
the
aim
of
their
darts
which
too
soon
fell
short
but
there
was
a
dark
heap
beneath
the
wall
where
ten
or
twelve
retainers
and
slaves
who
wore
no
armour
had
been
slain
or
disabled
upon
these
the
loss
invariably
fell
none
attempted
to
follow
the
retreating
party
who
slowly
returned
towards
the
camp
and
were
soon
apparently
in
safety
but
suddenly
a
fresh
party
of
the
enemy
appeared
upon
the
wall
and
the
instant
afterwards
three
retainers
dropped
as
if
struck
by
lightning
they
had
been
hit
by
sling
stones
whirled
with
great
force
by
practised
slingers
these
rounded
pebbles
come
with
such
impetus
as
to
stun
a
man
at
two
hundred
yards
the
aim
it
is
true
is
uncertain
but
where
there
is
a
body
of
troops
they
are
sure
to
strike
some
one
hastening
on
leaving
the
three
fallen
men
where
they
lay
the
rest
in
two
minutes
were
out
of
range
and
came
safely
into
camp
everyone
as
they
crossed
the
stream
ran
to
meet
them
the
king
included
and
as
he
passed
in
the
throng
felix
heard
him
remark
that
they
had
had
a
capital
main
of
cocks
that
morning
of
the
knights
only
one
was
much
injured
he
had
fallen
upon
a
stone
and
two
ribs
were
broken
the
rest
suffered
from
severe
bruises
but
had
no
wound
six
were
missing
probably
prisoners
for
as
courageous
as
their
masters
they
had
leapt
down
from
the
wall
into
the
town
eleven
other
retainers
or
slaves
were
slain
or
had
deserted
or
were
prisoners
and
no
trouble
was
taken
about
them
as
for
the
three
who
were
knocked
over
by
the
sling
stones
there
they
lay
until
they
recovered
their
senses
when
they
crawled
into
camp
this
incident
cooled
felix
ardour
for
the
fray
for
he
reflected
that
if
injured
thus
he
too
as
a
mere
groom
would
be
left
the
devotion
of
the
retainers
to
save
and
succour
their
masters
was
almost
heroic
the
mailed
knights
thought
no
more
of
their
men
unless
it
was
some
particular
favourite
than
of
a
hound
slashed
by
a
boar
tusk
in
the
chase
when
the
first
flush
of
his
excitement
had
passed
felix
thinking
over
the
scene
of
the
morning
as
he
took
his
horses
down
to
water
at
the
stream
became
filled
at
first
with
contempt
and
then
with
indignation
that
the
first
commander
of
the
age
should
thus
look
on
while
the
wall
was
won
before
his
eyes
and
yet
never
send
a
strong
detachment
or
move
himself
with
his
whole
army
to
follow
up
the
advantage
seemed
past
understanding
if
he
did
not
intend
to
follow
it
up
why
permit
such
desperate
ventures
which
must
be
overwhelmed
by
mere
numbers
and
could
result
only
in
the
loss
of
brave
men
and
if
he
did
permit
it
why
did
he
not
when
he
saw
they
were
overthrown
send
a
squadron
to
cover
their
retreat
to
call
such
an
exhibition
of
courage
a
main
of
cocks
to
look
on
it
as
a
mere
display
for
his
amusement
was
barbarous
and
cruel
in
the
extreme
he
worked
himself
up
into
a
state
of
anger
which
rendered
him
less
cautious
than
usual
in
expressing
his
opinions
the
king
was
not
nearly
so
much
at
fault
as
felix
arguing
on
abstract
principles
imagined
he
had
long
experience
of
war
and
he
knew
its
extreme
uncertainty
the
issue
of
the
greatest
battle
often
hung
on
the
conduct
of
a
single
leader
or
even
a
single
he
had
seen
walls
won
and
lost
before
to
follow
up
such
a
venture
with
a
strong
detachment
must
result
in
one
of
two
things
either
the
detachment
in
its
turn
must
be
supported
by
the
entire
army
or
it
must
eventually
retreat
if
it
retreated
the
loss
of
prestige
would
be
serious
and
might
encourage
the
enemy
to
attack
the
camp
for
it
was
only
his
prestige
which
prevented
them
if
supported
by
the
entire
army
then
the
fate
of
the
whole
expedition
depended
upon
that
single
day
the
enemy
had
the
advantage
of
the
wall
of
the
narrow
streets
and
enclosures
within
of
the
houses
each
of
which
would
become
a
fortress
and
thus
in
the
winding
streets
a
repulse
might
easily
happen
to
risk
such
an
event
would
be
folly
in
the
last
degree
before
the
town
had
been
dispirited
and
discouraged
by
the
continuance
of
the
siege
the
failure
of
their
provisions
or
the
fall
of
their
chief
leaders
in
the
daily
combats
that
took
place
the
army
had
no
discipline
whatever
beyond
that
of
the
attachment
of
the
retainer
to
his
lord
and
the
dread
of
punishment
on
the
part
of
the
slave
there
were
no
distinct
ranks
no
organized
corps
the
knights
followed
the
greater
barons
the
retainers
the
knights
the
greater
barons
followed
the
king
such
an
army
could
not
be
risked
in
an
assault
of
this
kind
the
venture
was
not
ordered
nor
was
it
discouraged
to
discourage
indeed
all
attempts
would
have
been
bad
policy
it
was
upon
the
courage
and
bravery
of
his
knights
that
the
king
depended
and
upon
that
alone
rested
his
hopes
of
victory
the
great
baron
whose
standard
they
followed
would
have
sent
them
assistance
if
he
had
deemed
it
necessary
the
king
unless
on
the
day
of
battle
would
not
trouble
about
such
a
detail
as
for
the
remark
that
they
had
had
a
good
main
of
cocks
that
morning
he
simply
expressed
the
feeling
of
the
whole
camp
the
spectacle
felix
had
seen
was
in
fact
merely
an
instance
of
the
strength
and
of
the
weakness
of
the
army
and
the
monarch
himself
felix
afterwards
acknowledged
these
things
to
himself
but
at
the
moment
full
of
admiration
for
the
bravery
of
the
four
knights
and
their
followers
he
was
full
of
indignation
and
uttered
his
views
too
freely
his
cautioned
him
but
his
spirit
was
up
and
he
gave
way
to
his
feelings
without
restraint
now
to
laugh
at
the
weaknesses
his
gluttony
or
follies
was
one
thing
to
criticise
his
military
conduct
was
another
the
one
was
merely
badinage
and
the
king
himself
might
have
laughed
had
he
heard
it
the
other
was
treason
and
moreover
likely
to
touch
the
monarch
on
the
delicate
matter
of
military
reputation
of
this
felix
quickly
became
aware
his
mates
indeed
tried
to
shield
him
but
possibly
the
citizen
his
master
had
enemies
in
the
camp
barons
perhaps
to
whom
he
had
lent
money
and
who
watched
for
a
chance
of
securing
his
downfall
at
all
events
early
the
next
day
felix
was
rudely
arrested
by
the
provost
in
person
bound
with
cords
and
placed
in
the
provost
booth
at
the
same
time
his
master
was
ordered
to
remain
within
and
a
guard
was
put
over
him
chapter
xx
in
danger
hope
died
within
felix
when
he
thus
suddenly
found
himself
so
near
the
executioner
he
had
known
so
many
butchered
without
cause
that
he
had
indeed
reason
to
despair
towards
the
sunset
he
felt
sure
he
should
be
dragged
forth
and
hanged
on
the
oak
used
for
the
purpose
and
which
stood
near
where
the
track
from
aisi
joined
the
camp
such
would
most
probably
have
been
his
fate
had
he
been
alone
concerned
in
this
affair
but
by
good
fortune
he
was
able
to
escape
so
miserable
an
end
still
he
suffered
as
much
as
if
the
rope
had
finished
him
for
he
had
no
means
of
knowing
what
would
be
the
result
his
heart
swelled
with
bitterness
he
was
filled
with
inexpressible
indignation
his
whole
being
rebelled
against
the
blundering
as
it
were
of
events
which
had
thus
thrown
him
into
the
jaws
of
death
in
an
hour
or
two
however
he
sufficiently
recovered
from
the
shock
to
reflect
that
most
probably
they
would
give
him
some
chance
to
speak
for
himself
there
would
not
be
any
trial
who
would
waste
time
in
trying
so
insignificant
a
wretch
but
there
might
be
some
opportunity
of
speaking
and
he
resolved
to
use
it
to
the
utmost
possible
extent
he
would
arraign
the
unskilful
generalship
of
the
king
he
would
not
only
point
out
his
errors
but
how
the
enemy
could
be
defeated
he
would
prove
that
he
had
ideas
and
plans
worthy
of
attention
he
would
as
it
were
vindicate
himself
before
he
was
executed
and
he
tried
to
collect
his
thoughts
and
to
put
them
into
form
every
moment
the
face
of
aurora
seemed
to
look
upon
him
lovingly
and
mournfully
but
beside
it
he
saw
the
dusty
and
distorted
features
of
the
copse
he
had
seen
drawn
by
the
horse
through
the
camp
thus
too
his
tongue
would
protrude
and
lick
the
dust
he
endured
in
a
word
those
treble
agonies
which
the
and
imaginative
inflict
upon
themselves
the
hours
passed
and
still
no
one
came
near
him
he
called
and
the
guard
appeared
at
the
door
but
only
to
see
what
was
the
matter
and
finding
his
prisoner
safe
at
once
resumed
his
walk
to
and
fro
the
soldier
did
not
for
his
own
sake
dare
to
enter
into
conversation
with
a
prisoner
under
arrest
for
such
an
offence
he
might
be
involved
or
suspected
had
it
been
merely
theft
or
any
ordinary
crime
he
would
have
talked
freely
enough
and
sympathized
with
the
prisoner
as
time
went
on
felix
grew
thirsty
but
his
request
for
water
was
disregarded
and
there
he
remained
till
four
in
the
afternoon
they
then
marched
him
out
he
begged
to
be
allowed
to
speak
but
the
soldiery
did
not
reply
simply
hurrying
him
forward
he
now
feared
that
he
should
be
executed
without
the
chance
being
afforded
him
to
say
a
word
but
to
his
surprise
he
found
in
a
few
minutes
that
they
were
taking
him
in
the
direction
of
the
king
quarters
new
fears
now
seized
him
for
he
had
heard
of
men
being
turned
loose
made
to
run
for
their
lives
and
hunted
down
with
hounds
for
the
amusement
of
the
court
if
the
citizen
wealth
had
made
him
many
enemies
men
whom
he
had
befriended
and
who
hoped
if
they
could
be
see
him
executed
to
escape
the
payment
of
their
debts
on
the
other
hand
it
had
made
him
as
many
friends
that
is
interested
friends
who
trusted
by
doing
him
service
to
obtain
advances
these
latter
had
lost
no
time
for
greed
is
quite
as
eager
as
hate
and
carried
the
matter
at
once
to
the
king
what
they
desired
was
that
the
case
should
be
decided
by
the
monarch
himself
and
not
by
his
chancellor
or
a
judge
appointed
for
the
purpose
the
judge
would
be
nearly
certain
to
condemn
the
citizen
and
to
confiscate
whatever
he
could
lay
hands
on
the
king
might
pardon
and
would
be
content
with
a
part
only
where
his
ministers
would
grasp
all
these
friends
succeeded
in
their
object
the
king
who
hated
all
judicial
affairs
because
they
involved
the
trouble
of
investigation
shrugged
his
shoulders
at
the
request
and
would
not
have
granted
it
had
it
not
come
out
that
the
citizen
servant
had
declared
him
to
be
an
incapable
commander
at
this
the
king
started
we
are
indeed
fallen
low
said
he
when
a
miserable
trader
knave
calls
us
incapable
we
will
see
this
impudent
rascal
he
accordingly
ordered
that
the
prisoner
should
be
brought
before
him
after
dinner
felix
was
led
inside
the
entrenchment
unbound
and
commanded
to
stand
upright
there
was
a
considerable
assembly
of
the
greater
barons
anxious
to
see
the
trial
of
the
who
though
present
was
kept
apart
from
felix
lest
the
two
should
arrange
their
defence
the
king
was
sleeping
on
a
couch
outside
the
booth
in
the
shade
he
was
lying
on
his
back
breathing
loudly
with
open
mouth
how
different
his
appearance
to
the
time
when
he
sat
on
his
splendid
charger
and
reviewed
his
knights
a
heavy
meal
had
been
succeeded
by
as
heavy
a
slumber
no
one
dared
to
disturb
him
the
assembly
moved
on
tiptoe
and
conversed
in
whispers
the
experienced
divined
that
the
prisoners
were
certain
to
be
condemned
for
the
king
would
wake
with
indigestion
and
vent
his
uneasy
sensations
upon
them
full
an
hour
elapsed
before
the
king
awoke
with
a
snort
and
called
for
a
draught
of
water
how
felix
envied
that
draught
he
had
neither
eaten
nor
drunk
since
the
night
previous
it
was
a
hot
day
and
his
tongue
was
dry
and
parched
the
citizen
was
first
accused
he
denied
any
treasonable
designs
or
expressions
whatever
as
for
the
other
prisoner
till
the
time
he
was
arrested
he
did
not
even
know
he
had
been
in
his
service
he
was
some
stroller
whom
his
grooms
had
incautiously
engaged
the
lazy
scoundrels
to
assist
them
he
had
never
even
spoken
to
him
it
the
knave
told
the
truth
he
must
acknowledge
this
how
now
said
the
king
turning
to
felix
what
do
you
say
it
is
true
replied
felix
he
has
never
spoken
to
me
nor
i
to
him
he
knew
nothing
of
what
i
said
i
said
it
on
my
own
account
and
i
say
it
again
and
pray
sir
knave
said
the
king
sitting
up
on
his
couch
for
he
was
surprised
to
hear
one
so
meanly
dressed
speak
so
correctly
and
so
boldly
face
him
what
was
it
you
did
say
if
your
majesty
will
order
me
a
single
drop
of
water
said
the
prisoner
i
will
repeat
it
word
for
word
but
i
have
had
nothing
the
whole
day
and
i
can
hardly
move
my
tongue
without
a
word
the
king
handed
him
the
cup
from
which
he
had
himself
drunk
never
surely
was
water
so
delicious
felix
drained
it
to
the
bottom
handed
it
back
an
officer
took
it
and
with
one
brief
thought
of
aurora
he
said
your
majesty
you
are
an
incapable
commander
go
on
said
the
king
sarcastically
why
am
i
incapable
you
have
attacked
the
wrong
city
these
three
are
all
your
enemies
and
you
have
attacked
the
first
they
stand
in
a
row
they
stand
in
a
row
repeated
the
king
and
we
will
knock
them
over
like
three
but
you
have
begun
with
the
end
one
said
felix
and
that
is
the
mistake
for
after
you
have
taken
the
first
you
must
take
the
second
and
still
after
that
the
third
but
you
might
have
saved
much
trouble
and
time
if
if
what
if
you
had
assaulted
the
middle
one
first
for
then
while
the
siege
went
on
you
would
have
been
able
to
prevent
either
of
the
other
two
towns
from
sending
assistance
and
when
you
had
taken
the
first
and
put
your
garrison
in
it
neither
of
the
others
could
have
stirred
or
reaped
their
corn
nor
could
they
even
communicate
with
each
other
since
you
would
be
between
them
and
in
fact
you
would
have
cut
your
enemies
in
twain
by
st
john
swore
the
king
it
is
a
good
idea
i
begin
to
think
but
go
on
you
have
more
to
say
i
think
too
your
majesty
that
by
staying
here
as
you
have
done
this
fortnight
past
without
action
you
have
encouraged
the
other
two
cities
to
make
more
desperate
resistance
and
it
seems
to
me
that
you
are
in
a
dangerous
position
and
may
at
any
moment
be
overwhelmed
with
disaster
for
there
is
nothing
whatever
to
prevent
either
of
the
other
two
from
sending
troops
to
burn
the
open
city
of
aisi
in
your
absence
and
that
danger
must
increase
every
day
as
they
take
courage
by
your
idleness
idleness
there
shall
be
idleness
no
longer
the
man
speaks
the
truth
we
will
consider
further
of
this
we
will
move
on
adelinton
turning
to
his
barons
if
it
please
your
majesty
said
baron
ingulph
this
man
invented
a
new
trigger
for
our
carriage
crossbows
but
he
was
lost
in
the
crowd
and
we
have
sought
for
him
in
vain
my
serjeant
here
has
this
moment
recognised
him
why
did
you
not
come
to
us
before
fellow
said
the
king
let
him
be
released
let
him
be
entertained
at
our
expense
give
him
clothes
and
a
sword
we
will
see
you
further
overjoyed
at
this
sudden
turn
of
fortune
felix
forgot
to
let
well
alone
he
had
his
audience
with
him
for
a
moment
he
could
not
resist
as
it
were
following
up
his
victory
he
thanked
the
king
and
added
that
he
could
make
a
machine
which
would
knock
the
walls
yonder
to
pieces
without
it
being
necessary
to
approach
nearer
than
half
a
what
is
this
said
the
king
ingulph
have
you
ever
heard
of
such
a
machine
there
is
no
such
thing
said
the
baron
beginning
to
feel
that
his
professional
reputation
as
the
master
of
the
artillery
was
assailed
there
is
nothing
of
the
kind
known
it
will
shoot
stones
as
big
as
heavy
as
a
man
can
lift
said
felix
eagerly
and
easily
knock
towers
to
fragments
the
king
looked
from
one
to
another
he
was
incredulous
the
baron
smiled
scornfully
ask
him
your
majesty
how
these
stones
are
to
be
thrown
no
bow
could
do
it
how
are
the
stones
to
be
thrown
said
the
king
sharply
beware
how
you
play
with
us
by
the
force
of
twisted
ropes
your
majesty
they
all
laughed
the
baron
said
you
see
your
majesty
there
is
nothing
of
the
kind
this
is
some
jester
the
twisted
rope
should
be
a
halter
said
another
courtier
one
of
those
who
hoped
for
the
rich
man
downfall
it
can
be
done
your
majesty
cried
felix
alarmed
i
assure
you
a
stone
of
two
hundredweight
might
be
thrown
a
quarter
of
a
mile
the
assembly
did
not
repress
its
contempt
the
man
is
a
fool
said
the
king
who
now
thought
that
felix
was
a
jester
who
had
put
a
trick
upon
him
but
your
joke
is
out
of
joint
i
will
teach
such
fellows
to
try
tricks
on
us
beat
him
out
of
camp
the
provost
men
seized
him
and
in
a
moment
he
was
dragged
off
his
feet
and
bodily
carried
outside
the
entrenchment
thence
they
pushed
him
along
beating
him
with
the
butts
of
their
spears
to
make
him
run
the
faster
the
groups
they
passed
laughed
and
jeered
the
dogs
barked
and
snapped
at
his
ankles
they
hurried
him
outside
the
camp
and
thrusting
him
savagely
with
their
spear
butts
sent
him
headlong
there
they
left
him
with
the
caution
which
he
did
not
hear
being
insensible
that
if
he
ventured
inside
the
lines
he
would
be
at
once
hanged
like
a
dead
dog
they
left
him
on
the
ground
some
hours
later
in
the
dusk
of
the
evening
felix
stole
from
the
spot
skirting
the
forest
like
a
wild
animal
afraid
to
venture
from
its
cover
till
he
reached
the
track
which
led
to
aisi
his
one
idea
was
to
reach
his
canoe
he
would
have
gone
through
the
woods
but
that
was
not
possible
without
axe
or
to
hew
a
way
the
tangled
brushwood
he
knew
to
be
impassable
having
observed
how
thick
it
was
when
coming
aching
and
trembling
in
every
limb
not
so
much
with
physical
suffering
as
that
kind
of
inward
fever
which
follows
unmerited
injury
the
revolt
of
the
mind
against
it
he
followed
the
track
as
fast
as
his
weary
frame
would
let
him
he
had
tasted
nothing
that
day
but
the
draught
from
the
king
cup
and
a
second
draught
when
he
recovered
consciousness
from
the
stream
that
flowed
past
the
camp
yet
he
walked
steadily
on
without
pause
his
head
hung
forward
and
his
arms
were
listless
but
his
feet
mechanically
plodded
on
he
walked
indeed
by
his
will
and
not
with
his
sinews
thus
like
a
ghost
for
there
was
no
life
in
him
he
traversed
the
shadowy
forest
the
dawn
came
and
still
he
kept
onwards
as
the
sun
rose
higher
having
now
travelled
fully
twenty
miles
he
saw
houses
on
the
right
of
the
trail
they
were
evidently
those
of
retainers
or
workmen
employed
on
the
manor
for
a
castle
stood
at
some
distance
an
hour
later
he
approached
the
second
or
open
city
of
aisi
where
the
ferry
was
across
the
channel
in
his
present
condition
he
could
not
pass
through
the
town
no
one
there
knew
of
his
disgrace
but
it
was
the
same
to
him
as
if
they
had
avoiding
the
town
itself
he
crossed
the
cultivated
fields
and
upon
arriving
at
the
channel
he
at
once
stepped
in
and
swam
across
to
the
opposite
shore
it
was
not
more
than
sixty
yards
but
weary
as
he
was
it
was
an
exhausting
effort
he
sat
down
but
immediately
got
up
and
struggled
on
the
church
tower
on
the
slope
of
the
hill
was
a
landmark
by
which
he
easily
discovered
the
direction
of
the
spot
where
he
had
hidden
the
canoe
but
he
felt
unable
to
push
through
the
belt
of
brushwood
reeds
and
flags
beside
the
shore
and
therefore
struck
through
the
firs
following
a
cattle
track
which
doubtless
led
to
another
grazing
ground
this
ran
parallel
with
the
shore
and
when
he
judged
himself
about
level
with
the
canoe
he
left
it
and
entered
the
wood
itself
for
a
little
way
he
could
walk
but
the
thick
fir
branches
soon
blocked
his
progress
and
he
could
progress
only
on
hands
and
knees
creeping
beneath
them
there
was
a
hollow
space
under
the
lower
branches
free
from
brushwood
thus
he
painfully
approached
the
lake
and
descending
the
hill
after
an
hour
weary
work
emerged
among
the
rushes
and
reeds
he
was
within
two
hundred
yards
of
the
canoe
for
he
recognised
the
island
opposite
it
in
ten
minutes
he
found
it
undisturbed
and
exactly
as
he
had
left
it
except
that
the
breeze
had
strewn
the
dry
reeds
with
which
it
was
covered
with
willow
leaves
yellow
and
dead
they
fall
while
all
the
rest
are
green
which
had
been
whirled
from
the
branches
throwing
himself
upon
the
reeds
beside
the
canoe
he
dropped
asleep
as
if
he
had
been
dead
he
awoke
as
the
sun
was
sinking
and
sat
up
hungry
in
the
extreme
but
much
refreshed
there
were
still
some
stores
in
the
canoe
of
which
he
ate
ravenously
but
he
felt
better
now
he
felt
at
home
beside
his
boat
he
could
hardly
believe
in
the
reality
of
the
hideous
dream
through
which
he
had
passed
but
when
he
tried
to
stand
his
feet
cut
and
blistered
only
too
painfully
assured
him
of
its
reality
he
took
out
his
hunter
hide
and
cloak
and
spread
himself
a
comfortable
bed
though
he
had
slept
so
long
he
was
still
weary
he
reclined
in
a
state
his
frame
slowly
recovering
from
the
strain
it
had
endured
till
by
degrees
he
fell
asleep
again
sleep
nothing
but
sleep

overtaxed
mind
and
body
chapter
xxi
a
voyage
the
sun
was
up
when
felix
awoke
and
as
he
raised
himself
the
beauty
of
the
lake
before
him
filled
him
with
pleasure
by
the
shore
it
was
so
calm
that
the
trees
were
perfectly
reflected
and
the
few
willow
leaves
that
had
fallen
floated
without
drifting
one
way
or
the
other
farther
out
the
islands
were
lit
up
with
the
sunlight
and
the
swallows
skimmed
the
water
following
the
outline
of
their
shores
in
the
lake
beyond
them
glimpses
of
which
he
could
see
through
the
channel
or
passage
between
there
was
a
ripple
where
the
faint
breeze
touched
the
surface
his
mind
went
out
to
the
beauty
of
it
he
did
not
question
or
analyse
his
feelings
he
launched
his
vessel
and
left
that
hard
and
tyrannical
land
for
the
loveliness
of
the
water
paddling
out
to
the
islands
he
passed
through
between
them
and
reached
the
open
lake
there
he
hoisted
the
sail
the
gentle
breeze
filled
it
the
sharp
cutwater
began
to
divide
the
ripples
a
bubbling
sound
arose
and
steering
due
north
straight
out
to
the
open
and
boundless
expanse
he
was
carried
swiftly
away
the
mallards
who
saw
the
canoe
coming
at
first
scarcely
moved
never
thinking
that
a
boat
would
venture
outside
the
islands
within
whose
line
they
were
accustomed
to
see
vessels
but
when
the
canoe
continued
to
bear
down
upon
them
they
flew
up
and
descended
far
away
to
one
side
when
he
had
sailed
past
the
spot
where
these
birds
had
floated
the
lake
was
his
own
by
the
shores
of
the
islands
the
crows
came
down
for
mussels
moorhens
swam
in
and
out
among
the
rushes
nibbled
at
the
flags
pikes
basked
at
the
edge
of
the
weeds
ran
along
the
sand
and
doubtless
an
otter
here
and
there
was
in
concealment
without
the
line
of
the
shoals
and
islets
now
that
the
mallards
had
flown
there
was
a
solitude
of
water
it
was
far
too
deep
for
the
longest
weeds
nothing
seemed
to
exist
here
the
very
seek
the
shore
or
are
drifted
by
the
currents
into
shallow
corners
neither
great
nor
little
care
for
the
broad
expanse
the
canoe
moved
more
rapidly
as
the
wind
came
now
with
its
full
force
over
the
distant
woods
and
hills
and
though
it
was
but
a
light
southerly
breeze
the
broad
sail
impelled
the
taper
vessel
swiftly
reclining
in
the
stern
felix
lost
all
consciousness
of
aught
but
that
he
was
pleasantly
borne
along
his
eyes
were
not
closed
and
he
was
aware
of
the
canoe
the
lake
the
sunshine
and
the
sky
and
yet
he
was
asleep
physically
awake
he
mentally
slumbered
it
was
rest
after
the
misery
exertion
and
excitement
of
the
last
fortnight
it
was
rest
intense
rest
for
body
and
mind
the
pressure
of
the
water
against
the
handle
of
the
the
slight
vibration
of
the
wood
as
the
bubbles
rushed
by
beneath
alone
perhaps
kept
him
from
really
falling
asleep
this
was
something
which
could
not
be
left
to
itself
it
must
be
firmly
grasped
and
that
effort
restrained
his
drowsiness
three
hours
passed
the
shore
was
twelve
or
fifteen
miles
behind
and
looked
like
a
blue
cloud
for
the
summer
haze
hid
the
hills
more
than
would
have
been
the
case
in
clearer
weather
another
hour
and
at
last
felix
awakening
from
his
slumberous
condition
looked
round
and
saw
nothing
but
the
waves
the
shore
he
had
left
had
entirely
disappeared
gone
down
if
there
were
land
more
lofty
on
either
hand
the
haze
concealed
it
he
looked
again
he
could
scarcely
comprehend
it
he
knew
the
lake
was
very
wide
but
it
had
never
occurred
to
him
that
he
might
possibly
sail
out
of
sight
of
land
this
then
was
why
the
mariners
would
not
quit
the
islands
they
feared
the
open
water
he
stood
up
and
swept
the
horizon
carefully
shading
his
eyes
with
his
hand
there
was
nothing
but
a
mist
at
the
horizon
he
was
alone
with
the
sun
the
sky
and
the
lake
he
could
not
surely
have
sailed
into
the
ocean
without
knowing
it
he
sat
down
dipped
his
hand
overboard
and
tasted
the
drops
that
adhered
the
water
was
pure
and
sweet
warm
from
the
summer
sunshine
there
was
not
so
much
as
a
swift
in
the
upper
sky
nothing
but
slender
filaments
of
white
cloud
no
swallows
glided
over
the
surface
of
the
water
if
there
were
fishes
he
could
not
see
them
through
the
waves
which
were
here
much
larger
sufficiently
large
though
the
wind
was
light
to
make
his
canoe
rise
and
fall
with
their
regular
rolling
to
see
fishes
a
calm
surface
is
necessary
and
like
other
creatures
they
haunt
the
shallows
and
the
shore
never
had
he
felt
alone
like
this
in
the
depths
of
the
farthest
forest
he
had
penetrated
had
he
contemplated
beforehand
the
possibility
of
passing
out
of
sight
of
land
when
he
found
that
the
canoe
had
arrived
he
would
probably
have
been
alarmed
and
anxious
for
his
safety
but
thus
stumbling
drowsily
into
the
solitude
of
the
vast
lake
he
was
so
astounded
with
his
own
discovery
so
absorbed
in
thinking
of
the
immense
expanse
that
the
idea
of
danger
did
not
occur
to
him
another
hour
passed
and
he
now
began
to
gaze
about
him
more
eagerly
for
some
sight
of
land
for
he
had
very
little
provision
with
him
and
he
did
not
wish
to
spend
the
night
upon
the
lake
presently
however
the
mist
on
the
horizon
ahead
appeared
to
thicken
and
then
became
blue
and
in
a
shorter
time
than
he
expected
land
came
in
sight
this
arose
from
the
fact
of
its
being
low
so
that
he
had
approached
nearer
than
he
knew
before
recognising
it
at
the
time
when
he
was
really
out
of
sight
of
the
coast
he
was
much
further
from
the
hilly
land
left
behind
than
from
the
low
country
in
front
and
not
in
the
mathematical
centre
as
he
had
supposed
of
the
lake
as
it
rose
and
came
more
into
sight
he
already
began
to
wonder
what
reception
he
should
meet
with
from
the
inhabitants
and
whether
he
should
find
them
as
hard
of
heart
as
the
people
he
had
just
escaped
from
should
he
indeed
venture
among
them
at
all
or
should
he
remain
in
the
woods
till
he
had
observed
more
of
their
ways
and
manners
these
questions
were
being
debated
in
his
mind
when
he
perceived
that
the
wind
was
falling
as
the
sun
went
past
the
meridian
the
breeze
fell
till
in
the
hottest
part
of
the
afternoon
and
when
he
judged
that
he
was
not
more
than
eight
miles
from
shore
it
sank
to
the
merest
zephyr
and
the
waves
by
degrees
diminished
so
faint
became
the
breeze
in
time
and
so
intermittent
that
he
found
it
patience
wasted
even
to
hold
the
the
sail
hung
and
was
no
longer
bellied
out
as
the
idle
waves
rolled
under
it
flapped
against
the
mast
the
heat
was
now
so
intolerable
the
light
reflected
from
the
water
increasing
the
sensation
that
he
was
obliged
to
make
himself
some
shelter
by
partly
lowering
the
sail
and
hauling
the
yard
athwart
the
vessel
so
that
the
canvas
acted
as
an
awning
gradually
the
waves
declined
in
volume
and
the
gentle
breathing
of
the
wind
ebbed
away
till
at
last
the
surface
was
almost
still
and
he
could
feel
no
perceptible
air
stirring
weary
of
sitting
in
the
narrow
boat
he
stood
up
but
he
could
not
stretch
himself
sufficiently
for
the
change
to
be
of
much
use
the
long
summer
day
previously
so
pleasant
now
appeared
scarcely
endurable
upon
the
silent
water
the
time
lingered
for
there
was
nothing
to
mark
its
advance
not
so
much
as
a
shadow
beyond
that
of
his
own
boat
the
waves
having
now
no
crest
went
under
the
canoe
without
chafing
against
it
or
rebounding
so
that
they
were
noiseless
no
fishes
rose
to
the
surface
there
was
nothing
living
near
except
a
blue
butterfly
which
settled
on
the
mast
having
ventured
thus
far
from
land
the
vastness
of
the
sky
the
broad
water
the
sun
and
the
motionless
filaments
of
cloud
gave
no
repose
for
his
gaze
for
they
were
seemingly
still
to
the
weary
gaze
motion
is
repose
the
waving
boughs
the
waves
afford
positive
rest
to
look
at
such
intense
stillness
as
this
of
the
summer
sky
was
oppressive
it
was
like
living
in
space
itself
in
the
ether
above
he
welcomed
at
last
the
gradual
downward
direction
of
the
sun
for
as
the
heat
decreased
he
could
work
with
the
paddle
presently
he
furled
the
sail
took
his
paddle
and
set
his
face
for
the
land
he
laboured
steadily
but
made
no
apparent
progress
the
canoe
was
heavy
and
the
outrigger
or
beam
which
was
of
material
use
in
sailing
was
a
drawback
to
paddling
he
worked
till
his
arms
grew
weary
and
still
the
blue
land
seemed
as
far
off
as
ever
but
by
the
time
the
sun
began
to
approach
the
horizon
his
efforts
had
produced
some
effect
the
shore
was
visible
and
the
woods
beyond
they
were
still
five
miles
distant
and
he
was
tired
there
was
little
chance
of
his
reaching
it
before
night
he
put
his
paddle
down
for
refreshment
and
rest
and
while
he
was
thus
engaged
a
change
took
place
a
faint
puff
of
air
came
a
second
and
a
third
a
tiny
ripple
ran
along
the
surface
now
he
recollected
that
he
had
heard
that
the
mariners
depended
a
great
deal
on
the
morning
and
the
evening
the
land
and
the
lake
breeze
as
they
worked
along
the
shore
this
was
the
first
breath
of
the
land
breeze
it
freshened
after
a
while
and
he
his
sail
an
hour
or
so
afterwards
he
came
near
the
shore
he
heard
the
thrushes
singing
and
the
cuckoo
calling
long
before
he
landed
he
did
not
stay
to
search
about
for
a
creek
but
ran
the
canoe
on
the
strand
which
was
free
of
reeds
or
flags
a
sign
that
the
waves
often
beat
furiously
there
rolling
as
they
must
for
so
many
miles
he
hauled
the
canoe
up
as
high
as
he
could
but
presently
when
he
looked
about
him
he
found
that
he
was
on
a
small
and
narrow
island
with
a
channel
in
the
rear
tired
as
he
was
yet
anxious
for
the
safety
of
his
canoe
he
pushed
off
again
and
paddled
round
and
again
beached
her
with
the
island
between
her
and
the
open
lake
else
he
feared
if
a
south
wind
should
blow
she
might
be
broken
to
pieces
on
the
strand
before
his
eyes
it
was
prudent
to
take
the
precaution
but
as
it
happened
the
next
day
the
lake
was
still
he
could
see
no
traces
of
human
occupation
upon
the
island
which
was
of
small
extent
and
nearly
bare
and
therefore
in
the
morning
paddled
across
the
channel
to
the
mainland
as
he
thought
but
upon
exploring
the
opposite
shore
it
proved
not
to
be
the
mainland
but
merely
another
island
paddling
round
it
he
tried
again
but
with
the
same
result
he
found
nothing
but
island
after
island
all
narrow
and
bearing
nothing
except
bushes
observing
a
channel
which
seemed
to
go
straight
in
among
these
islets
he
resolved
to
follow
it
and
did
so
resting
at
the
whole
morning
as
he
paddled
slowly
in
he
found
the
water
shallower
and
weeds
bulrushes
and
reeds
became
thick
except
quite
in
the
centre
after
the
heat
of
midday
had
gone
over
he
resumed
his
voyage
and
still
found
the
same
islets
and
banks
more
or
less
covered
with
hawthorn
bushes
willow
elder
and
alder
succeeded
to
islets
fringed
round
their
edges
with
reeds
and
reed
when
he
grew
weary
of
paddling
he
landed
and
stayed
the
night
the
next
day
he
went
on
again
and
still
for
hour
after
hour
rowed
in
and
out
among
these
banks
and
islets
till
he
began
to
think
he
should
never
find
his
way
out
the
farther
he
penetrated
the
more
numerous
became
the
waterfowl
ducks
swam
among
the
flags
or
rose
with
a
rush
and
splashing
coots
and
moorhens
dived
and
hid
in
the
reeds
the
lesser
grebe
sank
at
the
sound
of
the
paddle
like
a
stone
a
strong
northern
diver
raised
a
wave
as
he
hurried
away
under
the
water
his
course
marked
by
the
undulation
above
him
chirped
in
the
willows
buntings
sat
on
the
trees
and
watched
him
without
fear
bearded
titmice
were
there
clinging
to
the
stalks
of
the
sedges
and
herons
rose
from
the
reedy
places
where
they
love
to
wade
blue
darted
to
and
fro
or
sat
on
as
if
they
were
flowers
snakes
swam
across
the
channels
vibrating
their
heads
from
side
to
side
swallows
swept
over
his
head
pike
struck
from
the
verge
of
the
thick
weeds
as
he
came
near
perch
rose
for
insects
as
they
fell
helpless
into
the
water
he
noticed
that
the
water
though
so
thick
with
reeds
was
as
clear
as
that
in
the
open
lake
there
was
no
scum
such
as
accumulates
in
stagnant
places
from
this
he
concluded
that
there
must
be
a
current
however
slight
perhaps
from
rivers
flowing
into
this
part
of
the
lake
he
felt
the
strongest
desire
to
explore
farther
till
he
reached
the
mainland
but
he
reflected
that
mere
exploration
was
not
his
object
it
would
never
obtain
aurora
for
him
there
were
no
signs
whatever
of
human
habitation
and
from
reeds
and
bulrushes
however
interesting
nothing
could
be
gained
reluctantly
therefore
on
the
third
morning
having
passed
the
night
on
one
of
the
islets
he
turned
his
canoe
and
paddled
southwards
towards
the
lake
he
did
not
for
a
moment
attempt
to
retrace
the
channel
by
which
he
had
entered
it
would
have
been
an
impossibility
he
took
advantage
of
any
clear
space
to
push
through
it
took
him
as
long
to
get
out
as
it
had
to
get
in
it
was
the
afternoon
of
the
fourth
day
when
he
at
last
regained
the
coast
he
rested
the
remainder
of
the
afternoon
wishing
to
start
fresh
in
the
morning
having
determined
to
follow
the
line
of
the
shore
eastwards
and
so
gradually
to
circumnavigate
the
lake
if
he
succeeded
in
nothing
else
that
at
least
would
be
something
to
relate
to
aurora
the
morning
rose
fair
and
bright
with
a
air
rather
than
a
breeze
he
sailed
before
it
it
was
so
light
that
his
progress
could
not
have
exceeded
more
than
three
miles
an
hour
hour
after
hour
passed
away
and
still
he
followed
the
line
of
the
shore
now
going
a
short
way
out
to
skirt
an
island
and
now
nearer
it
to
pass
between
sandbanks
by
noon
he
was
so
weary
of
sitting
in
the
canoe
that
he
ran
her
ashore
and
rested
awhile
it
was
the
very
height
of
the
heat
of
the
day
when
he
set
forth
again
and
the
wind
lighter
than
in
the
morning
it
had
however
changed
a
little
and
blew
now
from
the
west
almost
too
exactly
abaft
to
suit
his
craft
he
could
not
make
a
map
while
sailing
or
observe
his
position
accurately
but
it
appeared
to
him
that
the
shore
trended
towards
the
so
that
he
was
gradually
turning
an
arc
he
supposed
from
this
that
he
must
be
approaching
the
eastern
end
of
the
lake
the
water
seemed
shallower
to
judge
from
the
quantity
of
weeds
now
and
then
he
caught
glimpses
between
the
numerous
islands
of
the
open
lake
and
there
too
the
weeds
covered
the
surface
in
many
places
in
an
hour
or
two
the
breeze
increased
considerably
and
travelling
so
much
quicker
he
found
it
required
all
his
dexterity
to
steer
past
the
islands
and
clear
the
banks
upon
which
he
was
drifting
once
or
twice
he
grazed
the
willows
that
overhung
the
water
and
heard
the
keel
of
the
canoe
drag
on
the
bottom
as
much
as
possible
he
bore
away
from
the
mainland
steering
thinking
to
find
deeper
water
and
to
be
free
of
the
islets
he
succeeded
in
the
first
but
the
islets
were
now
so
numerous
that
he
could
not
tell
where
the
open
lake
was
the
farther
the
afternoon
advanced
the
more
the
breeze
freshened
till
occasionally
as
it
blew
between
the
islands
it
struck
his
mast
almost
with
the
force
of
a
gale
felix
welcomed
the
wind
which
would
enable
him
to
make
great
progress
before
evening
if
such
favouring
breezes
would
continue
he
could
circumnavigate
the
waters
in
a
comparatively
short
time
and
might
return
to
aurora
so
far
at
least
successful
hope
filled
his
heart
and
he
sang
to
the
wind
the
waves
could
not
rise
among
these
islands
which
intercepted
them
before
they
could
roll
far
enough
to
gather
force
so
that
he
had
all
the
advantage
of
the
gale
without
its
risks
except
a
light
haze
all
round
the
horizon
the
sky
was
perfectly
clear
and
it
was
pleasant
now
the
strong
current
of
air
cooled
the
sun
heat
as
he
came
round
the
islands
he
constantly
met
and
disturbed
parties
of
waterfowl
mallards
and
coots
sometimes
they
merely
hid
in
the
weeds
sometimes
they
rose
and
when
they
did
so
passed
to
his
rear
chapter
xxii
discoveries
this
little
circumstance
of
the
mallards
always
flying
over
him
and
away
behind
when
flushed
presently
made
felix
speculate
on
the
cause
and
he
kept
a
closer
watch
he
now
saw
what
had
indeed
been
going
on
for
some
time
that
there
was
a
ceaseless
stream
of
waterfowl
mallards
ducks
coots
moorhens
and
lesser
grebes
coming
towards
him
swimming
to
the
westward
as
they
met
him
they
parted
and
let
him
through
or
rose
and
went
over
next
he
noticed
that
the
small
birds
on
the
islands
were
also
travelling
in
the
same
direction
that
is
against
the
wind
they
did
not
seem
in
any
haste
but
flitted
from
islet
to
islet
bush
to
tree
feeding
and
gossiping
as
they
went
still
the
movement
was
distinct
finches
linnets
blackbirds
thrushes
wrens
and
whitethroats
and
many
others
all
passed
him
and
he
could
see
the
same
thing
going
on
to
his
right
and
left
felix
became
much
interested
in
this
migration
all
the
more
singular
as
it
was
the
and
hundreds
of
these
birds
must
have
left
their
nests
with
eggs
or
young
behind
them
nothing
that
he
could
think
of
offered
an
adequate
explanation
he
imagined
he
saw
shoals
of
fishes
going
the
same
way
but
the
surface
of
the
water
being
ruffled
and
the
canoe
sailing
rapidly
he
could
not
be
certain
about
an
hour
after
he
first
observed
the
migration
the
stream
of
birds
ceased
suddenly
there
were
no
waterfowls
in
the
water
and
no
finches
in
the
bushes
they
had
evidently
all
passed
those
in
the
van
of
the
migratory
army
were
no
doubt
scattered
and
thinly
distributed
so
that
he
had
been
meeting
the
flocks
a
long
while
before
he
suspected
it
the
nearer
he
approached
their
centre
the
thicker
they
became
and
on
getting
through
that
he
found
a
solitude
the
weeds
were
thicker
than
ever
so
that
he
had
constantly
to
edge
away
from
where
he
supposed
the
mainland
to
lie
but
there
were
no
waterfowls
and
no
birds
on
the
islets
suddenly
as
he
rounded
a
large
island
he
saw
what
for
the
moment
he
imagined
to
be
a
line
of
white
surf
but
the
next
instant
he
recognised
a
solid
mass
as
it
were
of
swallows
and
martins
flying
just
over
the
surface
of
the
water
straight
towards
him
he
had
no
time
to
notice
how
far
they
extended
before
they
had
gone
by
him
with
a
rushing
sound
turning
to
look
back
he
saw
them
continue
directly
west
in
the
teeth
of
the
wind
like
the
water
and
the
islands
the
sky
was
now
cleared
of
birds
and
not
a
swallow
remained
felix
asked
himself
if
he
were
running
into
some
unknown
danger
but
he
could
not
conceive
any
the
only
thing
that
occurred
to
him
was
the
possibility
of
the
wind
rising
to
a
hurricane
that
gave
him
no
alarm
because
the
numerous
islands
would
afford
shelter
so
complete
was
the
shelter
in
some
places
that
as
he
passed
along
his
sail
drew
above
while
the
surface
of
the
water
almost
surrounded
with
bushes
and
willows
was
smooth
no
matter
to
how
many
quarters
of
the
compass
the
wind
might
veer
he
should
still
be
able
to
get
under
the
lee
of
one
or
other
of
the
banks
the
sky
remained
without
clouds
there
was
nothing
but
a
slight
haze
which
he
sometimes
fancied
looked
thicker
in
front
or
to
the
eastward
there
was
nothing
whatever
to
cause
the
least
uneasiness
on
the
contrary
his
curiosity
was
aroused
and
he
was
desirous
of
discovering
what
it
was
that
had
startled
the
birds
after
a
while
the
water
became
rather
more
open
with
sandbanks
instead
of
islands
so
that
he
could
see
around
him
for
a
considerable
distance
by
a
large
bank
behind
which
the
ripple
was
stilled
he
saw
a
low
wave
advancing
towards
him
and
moving
against
the
wind
it
was
followed
by
two
others
at
short
intervals
and
though
he
could
not
see
them
he
had
no
doubt
shoals
of
fishes
were
passing
and
had
raised
the
undulations
the
sedges
on
the
sandbanks
appeared
brown
and
withered
as
if
it
had
been
autumn
instead
of
early
summer
the
flags
were
brown
at
the
tip
and
the
aquatic
grasses
had
dwindled
they
looked
as
if
they
could
not
grow
and
had
reached
but
half
their
natural
height
from
the
low
willows
the
leaves
were
dropping
faded
and
yellow
and
the
thorn
bushes
were
shrivelled
and
covered
with
the
white
cocoons
of
caterpillars
the
farther
he
sailed
the
more
desolate
the
banks
seemed
and
trees
ceased
altogether
even
the
willows
were
fewer
and
stunted
and
the
highest
thorn
bush
was
not
above
his
chest
his
vessel
was
now
more
exposed
to
the
wind
so
that
he
drove
past
the
banks
and
scattered
islands
rapidly
and
he
noticed
that
there
was
not
so
much
as
a
crow
on
them
upturned
glittering
in
the
sunshine
showed
where
crows
had
been
at
work
but
there
was
not
one
now
visible
felix
thought
that
the
water
had
lost
its
clearness
and
had
become
thick
which
he
put
down
to
the
action
of
the
wavelets
disturbing
the
sand
in
the
shallows
ahead
the
haze
or
mist
was
now
much
thicker
and
was
apparently
not
over
a
mile
distant
it
hid
the
islands
and
concealed
everything
he
expected
to
enter
it
immediately
but
it
receded
as
he
approached
along
the
strand
of
an
island
he
passed
there
was
a
dark
line
like
a
stain
and
in
still
water
under
the
lee
the
surface
was
covered
with
a
floating
scum
felix
on
seeing
this
at
once
concluded
that
he
had
unknowingly
entered
a
gulf
and
had
left
the
main
lake
for
the
only
place
he
had
ever
seen
scum
before
was
at
the
extremity
of
a
creek
near
home
where
the
water
was
partly
stagnant
on
a
marshy
level
the
water
of
the
lake
was
proverbial
for
its
purity
and
clearness
he
kept
therefore
a
sharp
expecting
every
moment
to
sight
the
end
of
the
gulf
or
creek
in
which
he
supposed
himself
sailing
so
that
he
might
be
ready
to
lower
his
sail
by
degrees
the
wind
had
risen
till
it
now
blew
with
fury
but
the
numerous
sandflats
so
broke
up
the
waves
that
he
found
no
inconvenience
from
them
one
solitary
gull
passed
over
at
a
great
height
flying
steadily
westwards
against
the
wind
the
canoe
now
began
to
overtake
fragments
of
scum
drifting
before
the
wind
and
rising
up
and
down
on
the
ripples
once
he
saw
a
broad
piece
rise
to
the
surface
together
with
a
quantity
of
bubbles
none
of
the
sandbanks
now
rose
more
than
a
foot
or
so
above
the
surface
and
were
entirely
bare
mere
sand
and
gravel
the
mist
ahead
was
sensibly
nearer
and
yet
it
eluded
him
it
was
of
a
faint
yellow
and
though
so
thin
obscured
everything
where
it
hovered
from
out
of
the
mist
there
presently
appeared
a
vast
stretch
of
weeds
they
floated
on
the
surface
and
undulated
to
the
wavelets
a
pale
yellowish
green
expanse
felix
was
hesitating
whether
to
lower
his
sail
or
attempt
to
drive
over
them
when
as
he
advanced
and
the
mist
retreated
he
saw
open
water
beyond
the
weeds
extended
on
either
hand
as
far
as
he
could
see
but
they
were
only
a
narrow
band
and
he
hesitated
no
longer
he
felt
the
canoe
graze
the
bottom
once
as
he
sailed
over
the
weeds
the
water
was
free
of
sandbanks
beyond
them
but
he
could
see
large
islands
looming
in
several
directions
glancing
behind
him
he
perceived
that
the
faint
yellow
mist
had
closed
in
and
now
encircled
him
it
came
with
two
or
three
hundred
yards
and
was
not
affected
by
the
wind
rough
as
it
was
quite
suddenly
he
noticed
that
the
water
on
which
the
canoe
floated
was
black
the
wavelets
which
rolled
alongside
were
black
and
the
slight
spray
that
occasionally
flew
on
board
was
black
and
stained
the
side
of
the
vessel
this
greatly
astonished
and
almost
shocked
him
it
was
so
opposite
and
contrary
to
all
his
ideas
about
the
lake
the
very
mirror
of
purity
he
leant
over
and
dipped
up
a
little
in
the
palm
of
his
hand
it
did
not
appear
black
in
such
a
small
quantity
it
seemed
a
rusty
brown
but
he
became
aware
of
an
offensive
odour
the
odour
clung
to
his
hand
and
he
could
not
remove
it
to
his
great
disgust
it
was
like
nothing
he
had
ever
smelt
before
and
not
in
the
least
like
the
vapour
of
marshes
by
now
being
some
distance
from
any
island
the
wavelets
increased
in
size
and
spray
flew
on
board
wetting
everything
with
this
black
liquid
instead
of
level
marshes
and
the
end
of
the
gulf
it
appeared
as
if
the
water
were
deep
and
also
as
if
it
widened
exposed
to
the
full
press
of
the
gale
felix
began
to
fear
that
he
should
not
be
able
to
return
very
easily
against
it
he
did
not
know
what
to
do
the
horrid
blackness
of
the
water
disposed
him
to
turn
about
and
tack
out
on
the
other
hand
having
set
out
on
a
voyage
of
discovery
and
having
now
found
something
different
to
the
other
parts
of
the
lake
he
did
not
like
to
retreat
he
sailed
on
thinking
to
presently
pass
these
loathsome
waters
he
was
now
hungry
and
indeed
thirsty
but
was
unable
to
drink
because
he
had
no
no
vessel
sailing
on
the
lake
ever
carried
a
since
such
pure
water
was
always
under
their
bows
he
was
cramped
too
with
long
sitting
in
the
canoe
and
the
sun
was
perceptibly
sloping
in
the
west
he
determined
to
land
and
rest
and
with
this
purpose
steered
to
the
right
under
the
lee
of
a
large
island
so
large
indeed
that
he
was
not
certain
it
was
not
part
of
the
mainland
or
one
side
of
the
gulf
the
water
was
very
deep
close
up
to
the
shore
but
to
his
annoyance
the
strand
appeared
black
as
if
soaked
with
the
dark
water
he
skirted
along
somewhat
farther
and
found
a
ledge
of
low
rocks
stretching
out
into
the
lake
so
that
he
was
obliged
to
run
ashore
before
coming
to
these
on
landing
the
black
strand
to
his
relief
was
fairly
firm
for
he
had
dreaded
sinking
to
the
knees
in
it
but
its
appearance
was
so
unpleasant
that
he
could
not
bring
himself
to
sit
down
he
walked
on
towards
the
ledge
of
rocks
thinking
to
find
a
pleasanter
place
there
they
were
stratified
and
he
stepped
on
them
to
climb
up
when
his
foot
went
deep
into
the
apparently
hard
rock
he
kicked
it
and
his
shoe
penetrated
it
as
if
it
had
been
soft
sand
it
was
impossible
to
climb
up
the
reef
the
ground
rose
inland
and
curious
to
see
around
him
as
far
as
possible
he
ascended
the
slope
from
the
summit
however
he
could
not
see
farther
than
on
the
shore
for
the
pale
yellow
mist
rose
up
round
him
and
hid
the
canoe
on
the
strand
the
extreme
desolation
of
the
dark
and
barren
ground
repelled
him
there
was
not
a
tree
bush
or
living
creature
not
so
much
as
a
buzzing
fly
he
turned
to
go
down
and
then
for
the
first
time
noticed
that
the
disk
of
the
sun
was
surrounded
with
a
faint
blue
rim
apparently
caused
by
the
yellow
vapour
so
much
were
the
rays
shorn
of
their
glare
that
he
could
look
at
the
sun
without
any
distress
but
its
heat
seemed
to
have
increased
though
it
was
now
late
in
the
afternoon
descending
towards
the
canoe
he
fancied
the
wind
had
veered
considerably
he
sat
down
in
the
boat
and
took
some
food
it
was
without
relish
as
he
had
nothing
to
drink
and
the
great
heat
had
tired
him
wearily
and
without
thinking
he
pushed
off
the
canoe
she
slowly
floated
out
when
as
he
was
about
to
hoist
up
the
sail
a
tremendous
gust
of
wind
struck
him
down
on
the
thwarts
and
nearly
carried
him
overboard
he
caught
the
mast
as
he
fell
or
over
he
must
have
gone
into
the
black
waves
before
he
could
recover
himself
she
drifted
against
the
ledge
of
rocks
which
broke
down
and
sank
before
the
bow
so
that
she
passed
over
uninjured
felix
got
out
a
paddle
and
directed
the
canoe
as
well
as
he
could
the
fury
of
the
wind
was
irresistible
and
he
could
only
drive
before
it
in
a
few
minutes
as
he
was
swept
along
the
shore
he
was
carried
between
it
and
another
immense
reef
here
the
waves
being
broken
and
less
powerful
he
contrived
to
get
the
heavy
canoe
ashore
again
and
jumping
out
dragged
her
up
as
far
as
he
could
on
the
land
when
he
had
done
this
he
found
to
his
surprise
that
the
gale
had
ceased
the
tremendous
burst
of
wind
had
been
succeeded
by
a
perfect
calm
and
the
waves
had
already
lost
their
violent
impetus
this
was
a
relief
for
he
had
feared
that
the
canoe
would
be
utterly
broken
to
pieces
but
soon
he
began
to
doubt
if
it
were
an
unmixed
benefit
as
without
a
wind
he
could
not
move
from
this
dismal
place
that
evening
he
was
too
weary
to
paddle
far
he
sat
on
the
canoe
to
rest
himself
and
whether
from
fatigue
or
other
causes
fell
asleep
his
head
heavily
dropping
on
his
chest
partly
woke
him
several
times
but
his
lassitude
overcame
the
discomfort
and
he
slept
on
when
he
got
up
he
felt
dazed
and
unrefreshed
as
if
sleeping
had
been
hard
work
he
was
extremely
thirsty
and
oppressed
with
the
increasing
heat
the
sun
had
sunk
or
rather
was
so
low
that
the
high
ground
hid
it
from
sight
chapter
xxiii
strange
things
the
thought
struck
felix
that
perhaps
he
might
find
a
spring
somewhere
in
the
island
and
he
started
at
once
up
over
the
hill
at
the
top
he
paused
the
sun
had
not
sunk
but
had
disappeared
as
a
disk
in
its
place
was
a
billow
of
blood
for
so
it
looked
a
vast
billow
of
glowing
blood
surging
on
the
horizon
over
it
flickered
a
tint
of
palest
blue
like
that
seen
in
fire
the
black
waters
reflected
the
glow
and
the
yellow
vapour
around
was
suffused
with
it
though
momentarily
startled
felix
did
not
much
heed
these
appearances
he
was
still
dazed
and
heavy
from
his
sleep
he
went
on
looking
for
a
spring
sometimes
walking
on
firm
ground
sometimes
sinking
to
the
ankle
in
a
friable
soil
like
black
sand
the
ground
looked
indeed
as
if
it
had
been
burnt
but
there
were
no
charred
stumps
of
timber
such
as
he
had
seen
on
the
sites
of
forest
fires
the
extreme
dreariness
seemed
to
oppress
his
spirits
and
he
went
on
and
on
in
a
heavy
waking
dream
descending
into
a
plain
he
lost
sight
of
the
flaming
sunset
and
the
black
waters
in
the
level
plain
the
desolation
was
yet
more
marked
there
was
not
a
or
plant
the
surface
was
hard
black
and
burned
resembling
iron
and
indeed
in
places
it
resounded
to
his
feet
though
he
supposed
that
was
the
echo
from
hollow
passages
beneath
several
times
he
shook
himself
straightened
himself
up
and
endeavoured
to
throw
off
the
sense
of
drowsy
weight
which
increased
upon
him
he
could
not
do
so
he
walked
with
bent
back
and
crept
as
it
were
over
the
iron
land
which
radiated
heat
a
shimmer
like
that
of
water
appeared
in
front
he
quickened
his
pace
but
could
not
get
to
it
and
realized
presently
that
it
was
a
mirage
which
receded
as
he
advanced
there
was
no
pleasant
summer
twilight
the
sunset
was
succeeded
by
an
indefinite
gloom
and
while
this
shadow
hung
overhead
the
yellow
vapour
around
was
faintly
radiant
felix
suddenly
stopped
having
stepped
as
he
thought
on
a
skeleton
another
glance
however
showed
that
it
was
merely
the
impression
of
one
the
actual
bones
had
long
since
disappeared
the
ribs
the
skull
and
limbs
were
drawn
on
the
black
ground
in
white
lines
as
if
it
had
been
done
with
a
broad
piece
of
chalk
close
by
he
found
three
or
four
more
intertangled
and
superimposed
as
if
the
unhappy
beings
had
fallen
partly
across
each
other
and
in
that
position
had
mouldered
away
leaving
nothing
but
their
outline
from
among
a
variety
of
objects
that
were
scattered
about
felix
picked
up
something
that
shone
it
was
a
diamond
bracelet
of
one
large
stone
and
a
small
square
of
blue
china
tile
with
a
curious
heraldic
animal
drawn
on
it
evidently
these
had
belonged
to
one
or
other
of
the
party
who
had
perished
though
startled
at
the
first
sight
it
was
curious
that
felix
felt
so
little
horror
the
idea
did
not
occur
to
him
that
he
was
in
danger
as
these
had
been
inhaling
the
gaseous
emanations
from
the
soil
and
contained
in
the
yellow
vapour
he
had
become
narcotized
and
moved
as
if
under
the
influence
of
opium
while
wide
awake
and
capable
of
rational
conduct
his
senses
were
deadened
and
did
not
carry
the
usual
vivid
impression
to
the
mind
he
saw
things
as
if
they
were
afar
off
accidentally
looking
back
he
found
that
his
footmarks
as
far
as
he
could
see
shone
with
a
phosphoric
light
like
that
of
touchwood
in
the
dark
near
at
hand
they
did
not
shine
the
appearance
did
not
come
till
some
few
minutes
had
elapsed
his
track
was
visible
behind
till
the
vapour
hid
it
as
the
evening
drew
on
the
vapour
became
more
luminous
and
somewhat
resembled
an
aurora
still
anxious
for
water
he
proceeded
as
straight
ahead
as
he
could
and
shortly
became
conscious
of
an
indefinite
cloud
which
kept
pace
with
him
on
either
side
when
he
turned
to
look
at
either
of
the
clouds
the
one
looked
at
disappeared
it
was
not
condensed
enough
to
be
visible
to
direct
vision
yet
he
was
aware
of
it
from
the
corner
of
his
eye
shapeless
and
threatening
the
gloomy
thickness
of
the
air
floated
beside
him
like
the
vague
monster
of
a
dream
sometimes
he
fancied
that
he
saw
an
arm
or
a
limb
among
the
folds
of
the
cloud
or
an
approach
to
a
face
the
instant
he
looked
it
vanished
marching
at
each
hand
these
vapours
bore
him
horrible
company
his
brain
became
unsteady
and
flickering
things
moved
about
him
yet
though
alarmed
he
was
not
afraid
his
senses
were
not
acute
enough
for
fear
the
heat
increased
his
hands
were
intolerably
hot
as
if
he
had
been
in
a
fever
he
panted
but
did
not
perspire
a
dry
heat
like
an
oven
burned
his
blood
in
his
veins
his
head
felt
enlarged
and
his
eyes
seemed
alight
he
could
see
these
two
globes
of
phosphoric
light
under
his
brows
they
seemed
to
stand
out
so
that
he
could
see
them
he
thought
his
path
straight
it
was
really
curved
nor
did
he
know
that
he
staggered
as
he
walked
presently
a
white
object
appeared
ahead
and
on
coming
to
it
he
found
it
was
a
wall
white
as
snow
with
some
kind
of
crystal
he
touched
it
when
the
wall
fell
immediately
with
a
crushing
sound
as
if
pulverised
and
disappeared
in
a
vast
cavern
at
his
feet
beyond
this
chasm
he
came
to
more
walls
like
those
of
houses
such
as
would
be
left
if
the
roofs
fell
in
he
carefully
avoided
touching
them
for
they
seemed
as
brittle
as
glass
and
merely
a
white
powder
having
no
consistency
at
all
as
he
advanced
these
remnants
of
buildings
increased
in
number
so
that
he
had
to
wind
in
and
out
round
them
in
some
places
the
crystallized
wall
had
fallen
of
itself
and
he
could
see
down
into
the
cavern
for
the
house
had
either
been
built
partly
underground
or
which
was
more
probable
the
ground
had
risen
whether
the
walls
had
been
of
bricks
or
stone
or
other
material
he
could
not
tell
they
were
now
like
salt
soon
wearying
of
winding
round
these
walls
felix
returned
and
retraced
his
steps
till
he
was
outside
the
place
and
then
went
on
towards
the
left
not
long
after
as
he
still
walked
in
a
dream
and
without
feeling
his
feet
he
descended
a
slight
slope
and
found
the
ground
change
in
colour
from
black
to
a
dull
red
in
his
dazed
state
he
had
taken
several
steps
into
this
red
before
he
noticed
that
it
was
liquid
unctuous
and
slimy
like
a
thick
oil
it
deepened
rapidly
and
was
already
over
his
shoes
he
returned
to
the
black
shore
and
stood
looking
out
over
the
water
if
such
it
could
be
called
the
luminous
yellow
vapour
had
now
risen
a
height
of
ten
or
fifteen
feet
and
formed
a
roof
both
over
the
land
and
over
the
red
water
under
which
it
was
possible
to
see
for
a
great
distance
the
surface
of
the
red
oil
or
viscid
liquid
was
perfectly
smooth
and
indeed
it
did
not
seem
as
if
any
wind
could
rouse
a
wave
on
it
much
less
that
a
swell
should
be
left
after
the
gale
had
gone
down
disappointed
in
his
search
for
water
to
drink
felix
mechanically
turned
to
go
back
he
followed
his
luminous
footmarks
which
he
could
see
a
long
way
before
him
his
trail
curved
so
much
that
he
made
many
short
cuts
across
the
winding
line
he
had
left
his
weariness
was
now
so
intense
that
all
feeling
had
departed
his
feet
his
limbs
his
arms
and
hands
were
numbed
the
subtle
poison
of
the
emanations
from
the
earth
had
begun
to
deaden
his
nerves
it
seemed
a
full
hour
or
more
to
him
till
he
reached
the
spot
where
the
skeletons
were
drawn
in
white
upon
the
ground
he
passed
a
few
yards
to
one
side
of
them
and
stumbled
over
a
heap
of
something
which
he
did
not
observe
as
it
was
black
like
the
level
ground
it
emitted
a
metallic
sound
and
looking
he
saw
that
he
had
kicked
his
foot
against
a
great
heap
of
money
the
coins
were
black
as
ink
he
picked
up
a
handful
and
went
on
hitherto
felix
had
accepted
all
that
he
saw
as
something
so
strange
as
to
be
unaccountable
during
his
advance
into
this
region
in
the
canoe
he
had
in
fact
become
slowly
stupefied
by
the
poisonous
vapour
he
had
inhaled
his
mind
was
partly
in
abeyance
it
acted
but
only
after
some
time
had
elapsed
he
now
at
last
began
to
realize
his
position
the
finding
of
the
heap
of
blackened
money
touched
a
chord
of
memory
these
skeletons
were
the
miserable
relics
of
men
who
had
ventured
in
search
of
ancient
treasures
into
the
deadly
marshes
over
the
site
of
the
mightiest
city
of
former
days
the
deserted
and
utterly
extinct
city
of
london
was
under
his
feet
he
had
penetrated
into
the
midst
of
that
dreadful
place
of
which
he
had
heard
many
a
tradition
how
the
earth
was
poison
the
water
poison
the
air
poison
the
very
light
of
heaven
falling
through
such
an
atmosphere
poison
there
were
said
to
be
places
where
the
earth
was
on
fire
and
belched
forth
sulphurous
fumes
supposed
to
be
from
the
combustion
of
the
enormous
stores
of
strange
and
unknown
chemicals
collected
by
the
wonderful
people
of
those
times
upon
the
surface
of
the
water
there
was
a
oil
to
touch
which
was
death
to
any
creature
it
was
the
very
essence
of
corruption
sometimes
it
floated
before
the
wind
and
fragments
became
attached
to
reeds
or
flags
far
from
the
place
itself
if
a
moorhen
or
duck
chanced
to
rub
the
reed
and
but
one
drop
stuck
to
its
feathers
it
forthwith
died
of
the
red
water
he
had
not
heard
nor
of
the
black
into
which
he
had
unwittingly
sailed
ghastly
beings
haunted
the
site
of
so
many
crimes
shapeless
monsters
hovering
by
night
and
weaving
a
fearful
dance
frequently
they
caught
fire
as
it
seemed
and
burned
as
they
flew
or
floated
in
the
air
remembering
these
stories
which
in
part
at
least
now
seemed
to
be
true
felix
glanced
aside
where
the
cloud
still
kept
pace
with
him
and
involuntarily
put
his
hands
to
his
ears
lest
the
darkness
of
the
air
should
whisper
some
horror
of
old
times
the
earth
on
which
he
walked
the
black
earth
leaving
phosphoric
footmarks
behind
him
was
composed
of
the
mouldered
bodies
of
millions
of
men
who
had
passed
away
in
the
centuries
during
which
the
city
existed
he
shuddered
as
he
moved
he
hastened
yet
could
not
go
fast
his
numbed
limbs
would
not
permit
him
he
dreaded
lest
he
should
fall
and
sleep
and
wake
no
more
like
the
searchers
after
treasure
treasure
which
they
had
found
only
to
lose
for
ever
he
looked
around
supposing
that
he
might
see
the
gleaming
head
and
shoulders
of
the
giant
of
which
he
recollected
he
had
been
told
the
giant
was
punished
for
some
crime
by
being
buried
to
the
chest
in
the
earth
fire
incessantly
consumed
his
head
and
played
about
it
yet
it
was
not
destroyed
the
learned
thought
if
such
a
thing
really
existed
that
it
must
be
the
upper
part
of
an
ancient
brazen
statue
kept
bright
by
the
action
of
acid
in
the
atmosphere
and
shining
with
reflected
light
felix
did
not
see
it
and
shortly
afterwards
surmounted
the
hill
and
looked
down
upon
his
canoe
it
was
on
fire
chapter
xxiv
fiery
vapours
felix
tried
to
run
but
his
feet
would
not
rise
from
the
ground
his
limbs
were
numb
as
in
a
nightmare
he
could
not
get
there
his
body
would
not
obey
his
will
in
reality
he
did
move
but
more
slowly
than
when
he
walked
by
degrees
approaching
the
canoe
his
alarm
subsided
for
although
it
burned
it
was
not
injured
the
canvas
of
the
sail
was
not
even
scorched
when
he
got
to
it
the
flames
had
disappeared
like
the
phosphoric
fire
receded
from
him
with
all
his
strength
he
strove
to
launch
her
yet
paused
for
over
the
surface
of
the
black
water
now
smooth
and
waveless
played
immense
curling
flames
stretching
out
like
endless
serpents
weaving
winding
rolling
over
each
other
suddenly
they
contracted
into
a
ball
which
shone
with
a
steady
light
and
was
as
large
as
the
full
moon
the
ball
swept
along
rose
a
little
and
from
it
flew
out
long
streamers
till
it
was
unwound
in
fiery
threads
but
remembering
that
the
flames
had
not
even
scorched
the
canvas
he
pushed
the
canoe
afloat
determined
at
any
risk
to
leave
this
dreadful
place
to
his
joy
he
felt
a
faint
air
rising
it
cooled
his
forehead
but
was
not
enough
to
fill
the
sail
he
paddled
with
all
the
strength
he
had
left
the
air
seemed
to
come
from
exactly
the
opposite
direction
to
what
it
had
previously
blown
some
point
of
east
he
supposed
labour
as
hard
as
he
would
the
canoe
moved
slowly
being
so
heavy
it
seemed
as
if
the
black
water
was
thick
and
clung
to
her
retarding
motion
still
he
did
move
and
in
time
it
seemed
indeed
a
time
he
left
the
island
which
disappeared
in
the
luminous
vapours
uncertain
as
to
the
direction
he
got
his
compass
but
it
would
not
act
the
needle
had
no
life
it
swung
and
came
to
rest
pointing
any
way
as
it
chanced
it
was
demagnetized
felix
resolved
to
trust
to
the
wind
which
he
was
certain
blew
from
the
opposite
quarter
and
would
therefore
carry
him
out
the
stars
he
could
not
see
for
the
vapour
which
formed
a
roof
above
him
the
wind
was
rising
but
in
uncertain
gusts
however
he
hoisted
the
sail
and
floated
slowly
before
it
nothing
but
excitement
could
have
kept
him
awake
reclining
in
the
canoe
he
watched
the
flames
playing
over
the
surface
and
forced
himself
by
sheer
power
of
will
not
to
sleep
the
two
dark
clouds
which
had
accompanied
him
to
the
shore
now
faded
away
and
the
cooling
wind
enabled
him
to
bear
up
better
against
his
parching
thirst
his
hope
was
to
reach
the
clear
and
beautiful
lake
his
dread
that
in
the
uncertain
light
he
might
strike
a
concealed
sandbank
and
become
firmly
fixed
twice
he
passed
islands
distinguishable
as
masses
of
visible
darkness
while
the
twisted
flames
played
up
to
the
shore
and
the
luminous
vapour
overhung
the
ground
the
island
itself
appeared
as
a
black
mass
the
wind
became
by
degrees
steadier
and
the
canoe
shot
swiftly
over
the
water
his
hopes
rose
he
sat
up
and
kept
a
keener
ahead
all
at
once
the
canoe
shook
as
if
she
had
struck
a
rock
she
vibrated
from
one
end
to
the
other
and
stopped
for
a
moment
in
her
course
felix
sprang
up
alarmed
at
the
same
instant
a
bellowing
noise
reached
him
succeeded
by
a
frightful
belching
and
roaring
as
if
a
volcano
had
burst
forth
under
the
surface
of
the
water
he
looked
back
but
could
see
nothing
the
canoe
had
not
touched
ground
she
sailed
as
rapidly
as
before
again
the
shock
and
again
the
hideous
roaring
as
if
some
force
beneath
the
water
were
forcing
itself
up
vast
bubbles
rising
and
turning
fortunately
it
was
at
a
great
distance
hardly
was
it
silent
before
it
was
reiterated
for
the
third
time
next
felix
felt
the
canoe
heave
up
and
he
was
aware
that
a
large
roller
had
passed
under
him
a
second
and
a
third
followed
they
were
without
crests
and
were
not
raised
by
the
wind
they
obviously
started
from
the
scene
of
the
disturbance
soon
afterwards
the
canoe
moved
quicker
and
he
detected
a
strong
current
setting
in
the
direction
he
was
sailing
the
noise
did
not
recur
nor
did
any
more
rollers
pass
under
felix
felt
better
and
less
dazed
but
his
weariness
and
sleepiness
increased
every
moment
he
fancied
that
the
serpent
flames
were
less
brilliant
and
farther
apart
and
that
the
luminous
vapour
was
thinner
how
long
he
sat
at
the
rudder
he
could
not
tell
he
noticed
that
it
seemed
to
grow
darker
the
serpent
flames
faded
away
and
the
luminous
vapour
was
succeeded
by
something
like
the
natural
gloom
of
night
at
last
he
saw
a
star
overhead
and
hailed
it
with
joy
he
thought
of
aurora
the
next
instant
he
fell
back
in
the
canoe
firm
asleep
his
arm
however
still
retained
the
in
position
so
that
the
canoe
sped
on
with
equal
swiftness
she
would
have
struck
more
than
one
of
the
sandbanks
and
islets
had
it
not
been
for
the
strong
current
that
was
running
instead
of
carrying
her
against
the
banks
this
warded
her
off
for
it
drew
her
between
the
islets
in
the
channels
where
it
ran
fastest
and
the
undertow
where
it
struck
the
shore
bore
her
back
from
the
land
driving
before
the
wind
the
canoe
swept
onward
steadily
to
the
west
in
an
hour
it
had
passed
the
line
of
the
black
water
and
entered
the
sweet
lake
another
hour
and
all
trace
of
the
marshes
had
utterly
disappeared
the
last
faint
glow
of
the
vapour
had
vanished
the
dawn
of
the
coming
summer
day
appeared
and
the
sky
became
a
lovely
azure
the
canoe
sailed
on
but
felix
remained
immovable
in
slumber
long
since
the
strong
current
had
ceased
it
scarcely
extended
into
the
sweet
waters
and
the
wind
only
impelled
the
canoe
as
the
sun
rose
the
breeze
gradually
fell
away
and
in
an
hour
or
so
there
was
only
a
light
air
the
canoe
had
left
most
of
the
islets
and
was
approaching
the
open
lake
when
as
she
passed
almost
the
last
the
yard
caught
the
overhanging
branch
of
a
willow
the
canoe
swung
round
and
grounded
gently
under
the
shadow
of
the
tree
for
some
time
the
little
wavelets
beat
against
the
side
of
the
boat
gradually
they
ceased
and
the
clear
and
beautiful
water
became
still
felix
slept
till
nearly
noon
when
he
awoke
and
sat
up
at
the
sudden
movement
a
pike
struck
and
two
moorhens
scuttled
out
of
the
water
into
the
grass
on
the
shore
a
thrush
was
singing
sweetly
whitethroats
were
busy
in
the
bushes
and
swallows
swept
by
overhead
felix
drew
a
long
deep
breath
of
intense
relief
it
was
like
awakening
in
paradise
he
snatched
up
a
cup
dipped
and
satisfied
his
craving
thirst
then
washed
his
hands
over
the
side
and
threw
the
water
over
his
face
but
when
he
came
to
stand
up
and
move
he
found
that
his
limbs
were
almost
powerless
like
a
child
he
tottered
his
joints
had
no
strength
his
legs
tingled
as
if
they
had
been
benumbed
he
was
so
weak
he
crawled
on
all
fours
along
to
the
mast
furled
the
sail
kneeling
and
dragged
himself
rather
than
stepped
ashore
with
the
painter
the
instant
he
had
fastened
the
rope
to
a
branch
he
threw
himself
at
full
length
on
the
grass
and
grasped
a
handful
of
it
merely
to
touch
the
grass
after
such
an
experience
was
intense
delight
the
song
of
the
thrush
the
chatter
of
the
whitethroats
the
sight
of
a
gave
him
inexpressible
pleasure
lying
on
the
sward
he
watched
the
curves
traced
by
the
swallows
in
the
sky
from
the
sedges
came
the
curious
cry
of
the
moorhen
a
bright
kingfisher
went
by
he
rested
as
he
had
never
rested
before
his
whole
body
his
whole
being
was
resigned
to
rest
it
was
fully
two
hours
before
he
rose
and
crept
on
all
fours
into
the
canoe
for
food
there
was
only
sufficient
left
for
one
meal
but
that
gave
him
no
concern
now
he
was
out
of
the
marshes
he
could
fish
and
use
his
crossbow
he
now
observed
what
had
escaped
him
during
the
night
the
canoe
was
black
from
end
to
end
stem
stern
gunwale
thwart
outrigger
mast
and
sail
were
black
the
stain
did
not
come
off
on
being
touched
it
seemed
burnt
in
as
he
leaned
over
the
side
to
dip
water
and
saw
his
reflection
he
started
his
face
was
black
his
clothes
were
black
his
hair
black
in
his
eagerness
to
drink
the
first
time
he
had
noticed
nothing
his
hands
were
less
dark
contact
with
the
paddle
and
ropes
had
partly
rubbed
it
off
he
supposed
he
washed
but
the
water
did
not
materially
diminish
the
discoloration
after
eating
he
returned
to
the
grass
and
rested
again
and
it
was
not
till
the
sun
was
sinking
that
he
felt
any
return
of
vigour
still
weak
but
able
now
to
walk
leaning
on
a
stick
he
began
to
make
a
camp
for
the
coming
night
but
a
few
scraps
the
remnant
of
his
former
meal
were
left
on
these
he
supped
after
a
fashion
and
long
before
the
white
owl
began
his
rounds
felix
was
fast
asleep
on
his
hunter
hide
from
the
canoe
he
found
next
morning
that
the
island
was
small
only
a
few
acres
it
was
dry
and
sandy
in
places
he
had
little
inclination
or
strength
to
resume
his
expedition
he
erected
a
booth
of
branches
and
resolved
to
stay
a
few
days
till
his
strength
returned
by
shooting
wildfowl
and
fishing
he
fared
very
well
and
soon
recovered
in
two
days
the
discoloration
of
the
skin
had
faded
to
an
olive
tint
which
too
grew
fainter
the
canoe
lost
its
blackness
and
became
a
rusty
colour
by
rubbing
the
coins
he
had
carried
away
he
found
they
were
gold
part
of
the
inscription
remained
but
he
could
not
read
it
the
blue
was
less
injured
than
the
metal
after
washing
it
it
was
bright
but
the
diamond
pleased
him
most
it
would
be
a
splendid
present
for
aurora
never
had
he
seen
anything
like
it
in
the
palaces
he
believe
it
was
twice
the
size
of
the
largest
possessed
by
any
king
or
prince
it
was
as
big
as
his
and
shone
and
gleamed
in
the
sunlight
sparkling
and
reflecting
the
beams
its
value
must
be
very
great
but
well
he
knew
how
dangerous
it
would
be
to
exhibit
it
on
some
pretext
or
other
he
would
be
thrown
into
prison
and
the
gem
seized
it
must
be
hidden
with
the
greatest
care
till
he
could
produce
it
in
thyma
castle
when
the
baron
would
protect
it
felix
regretted
now
that
he
had
not
searched
further
perhaps
he
might
have
found
other
treasures
for
aurora
the
next
instant
he
repudiated
his
greed
and
was
only
thankful
that
he
had
escaped
with
his
life
he
wondered
and
marvelled
that
he
had
done
so
it
was
so
well
known
that
almost
all
who
had
ventured
in
had
perished
reflecting
on
the
circumstances
which
had
accompanied
his
entrance
to
the
marshes
the
migration
of
the
birds
seemed
almost
the
most
singular
they
were
evidently
flying
from
some
apprehended
danger
and
that
most
probably
would
be
in
the
air
the
gale
at
that
time
however
was
blowing
in
a
direction
which
would
appear
to
ensure
safety
to
them
into
and
not
out
of
the
poisonous
marshes
did
they
then
foresee
that
it
would
change
did
they
expect
it
to
veer
like
a
cyclone
and
presently
blow
east
with
the
same
vigour
as
it
then
blew
west
that
would
carry
the
vapour
from
the
inky
waters
out
over
the
sweet
lake
and
might
even
cause
the
foul
water
itself
to
temporarily
encroach
on
the
sweet
the
more
he
thought
of
it
the
more
he
felt
convinced
that
this
was
the
explanation
and
as
a
fact
the
wind
after
dropping
did
arise
again
and
blow
from
the
east
though
as
it
happened
not
with
nearly
the
same
strength
it
fell
too
before
long
fortunately
for
him
clearly
the
birds
had
anticipated
a
cyclone
and
that
the
wind
turning
would
carry
the
gases
out
upon
them
to
their
destruction
they
had
therefore
hurried
away
and
the
fishes
had
done
the
same
the
velocity
of
the
gale
which
had
carried
him
into
the
black
waters
had
proved
his
safety
by
driving
before
it
the
thicker
and
most
poisonous
portion
of
the
vapour
compressing
it
towards
the
east
so
that
he
had
entered
the
dreaded
precincts
under
favourable
conditions
when
it
dropped
while
he
was
on
the
black
island
he
soon
began
to
feel
the
effect
of
the
gases
rising
imperceptibly
from
the
soil
and
had
he
not
had
the
good
fortune
to
escape
so
soon
no
doubt
he
would
have
fallen
a
victim
he
could
not
congratulate
himself
sufficiently
upon
his
good
fortune
the
other
circumstances
appeared
to
be
due
to
the
decay
of
the
ancient
city
to
the
decomposition
of
accumulated
matter
to
phosphorescence
and
gaseous
exhalations
the
black
rocks
that
crumbled
at
a
touch
were
doubtless
the
remains
of
ancient
buildings
saturated
with
the
dark
water
and
vapours
inland
similar
remains
were
white
and
resembled
salt
but
the
great
explosions
which
occurred
as
he
was
leaving
and
which
sent
heavy
rollers
after
him
were
not
easily
understood
till
he
remembered
that
in
sylvester
book
of
natural
things
it
was
related
that
the
ancient
city
had
been
undermined
with
vast
conduits
sewers
and
tunnels
and
that
these
communicated
with
the
sea
it
had
been
much
disputed
whether
the
sea
did
or
did
not
still
send
its
tides
up
to
the
site
of
the
old
quays
felix
now
thought
that
the
explosions
were
due
to
compressed
air
or
more
probably
to
gases
met
with
by
the
ascending
tide
chapter
xxv
the
shepherds
for
four
days
felix
remained
on
the
island
recovering
his
strength
by
degrees
the
memory
of
the
scenes
he
had
witnessed
grew
less
vivid
and
his
nerves
regained
their
tone
the
fifth
morning
he
sailed
again
making
due
south
with
a
gentle
breeze
from
the
west
which
suited
the
canoe
very
well
he
considered
that
he
was
now
at
the
eastern
extremity
of
the
lake
and
that
by
sailing
south
he
should
presently
reach
the
place
where
the
shore
turned
to
the
east
again
the
sharp
prow
of
the
canoe
cut
swiftly
through
the
waves
a
light
spray
flew
occasionally
in
his
face
and
the
wind
blew
pleasantly
in
the
cloudless
sky
swallows
and
swifts
were
wheeling
and
on
the
water
half
a
dozen
mallards
moved
aside
to
let
him
pass
about
two
hours
after
he
started
he
encountered
a
mist
which
came
softly
over
the
surface
of
the
water
with
the
wind
and
in
an
instant
shut
out
all
view
even
the
sun
was
scarcely
visible
it
was
very
warm
and
left
no
moisture
in
five
minutes
he
passed
through
and
emerged
again
in
the
bright
sunlight
these
dry
warm
mists
are
frequently
seen
on
the
lake
in
summer
and
are
believed
to
portend
a
continuance
of
fine
weather
felix
kept
a
good
distance
from
the
mainland
which
was
hilly
and
wooded
and
with
few
islands
presently
he
observed
in
the
extreme
distance
on
his
right
hand
a
line
of
mountainous
hills
which
he
supposed
to
be
the
southern
shore
of
the
lake
and
that
he
was
sailing
into
a
gulf
or
bay
he
debated
with
himself
whether
he
should
alter
his
course
and
work
across
to
the
mountains
or
to
continue
to
trace
the
shore
unless
he
did
trace
the
shore
he
could
scarcely
say
that
he
had
circumnavigated
the
lake
as
he
would
leave
this
great
bay
unexplored
he
continued
therefore
to
sail
directly
south
the
wind
freshened
towards
noon
and
the
canoe
flew
at
a
great
pace
twice
he
passed
through
similar
mists
there
were
now
no
islands
at
all
but
a
line
of
low
chalk
cliffs
marked
the
shore
considering
that
it
must
be
deep
and
safe
to
do
so
felix
bore
in
closer
to
look
at
the
land
woods
ran
along
the
hills
right
to
the
verge
of
the
cliff
but
he
saw
no
signs
of
inhabitants
no
smoke
boat
or
house
the
sound
of
the
surf
beating
on
the
beach
was
audible
though
the
waves
were
not
large
high
over
the
cliff
he
noted
a
kite
soaring
with
forked
tail
at
a
great
height
immediately
afterwards
he
ran
into
another
mist
or
vapour
thicker
if
anything
and
which
quite
obscured
his
view
it
seemed
like
a
great
cloud
on
the
surface
of
the
water
and
broader
than
those
he
had
previously
entered
suddenly
the
canoe
stopped
with
a
tremendous
jerk
which
pitched
him
forward
on
his
knees
the
mast
cracked
and
there
was
a
noise
of
splitting
wood
as
soon
as
he
could
get
up
felix
saw
to
his
bitter
sorrow
that
the
canoe
had
split
longitudinally
the
water
came
up
through
the
split
and
the
boat
was
held
together
only
by
the
beams
of
the
outrigger
he
had
run
aground
on
a
large
sharp
flint
embedded
in
a
chalk
floor
which
had
split
the
poplar
wood
of
the
canoe
like
an
axe
the
voyage
was
over
for
the
least
strain
would
cause
the
canoe
to
part
in
two
and
if
she
were
washed
off
the
ground
she
would
be
in
half
a
minute
the
mist
passed
leaving
him
in
the
bright
day
shipwrecked
felix
now
saw
that
the
waters
were
white
with
suspended
chalk
and
sounding
with
the
paddle
found
that
the
depth
was
but
a
few
inches
he
had
driven
at
full
speed
on
a
reef
there
was
no
danger
for
the
distance
to
the
shore
was
hardly
two
hundred
yards
and
judging
by
the
appearance
of
the
water
it
was
shallow
all
the
way
but
his
canoe
the
product
of
so
much
labour
and
in
which
he
had
voyaged
so
far
his
canoe
was
destroyed
he
could
not
repair
her
he
doubted
whether
it
could
have
been
done
successfully
even
at
home
with
oliver
to
help
him
he
could
sail
no
farther
there
was
nothing
for
it
but
to
get
ashore
and
travel
on
foot
if
the
wind
rose
higher
the
waves
would
soon
break
clean
over
her
and
she
would
go
to
pieces
with
a
heavy
heart
felix
took
his
paddle
and
stepped
overboard
feeling
with
the
paddle
he
plumbed
the
depth
in
front
of
him
and
as
he
expected
walked
all
the
way
to
the
shore
no
deeper
than
his
knees
this
was
fortunate
as
it
enabled
him
to
convey
his
things
to
land
without
loss
he
wrapped
up
the
tools
and
manuscripts
in
one
of
his
hunter
hides
when
the
whole
cargo
was
landed
he
sat
down
sorrowfully
at
the
foot
of
the
cliff
and
looked
out
at
the
broken
mast
and
sail
still
flapping
uselessly
in
the
breeze
it
was
a
long
time
before
he
recovered
himself
and
set
to
work
mechanically
to
bury
the
crossbow
hunter
hides
tools
and
manuscripts
under
a
heap
of
pebbles
as
the
cliff
though
low
was
perpendicular
he
could
not
scale
it
else
he
would
have
preferred
to
conceal
them
in
the
woods
above
to
pile
pebbles
over
them
was
the
best
he
could
do
for
the
present
he
intended
to
return
for
them
when
he
discovered
a
path
up
the
cliff
he
then
started
taking
only
his
bow
and
arrows
but
no
such
path
was
to
be
found
he
walked
on
and
on
till
weary
and
still
the
cliff
ran
like
a
wall
on
his
left
hand
after
an
hour
rest
he
started
again
and
as
the
sun
was
declining
came
suddenly
to
a
gap
in
the
cliff
where
a
grassy
sward
came
down
to
the
shore
it
was
now
too
late
and
he
was
too
weary
to
think
of
returning
for
his
things
that
evening
he
made
a
scanty
meal
and
endeavoured
to
rest
but
the
excitement
of
losing
the
canoe
the
long
march
since
the
lack
of
good
food
all
tended
to
render
him
restless
weary
he
could
not
rest
nor
move
farther
the
time
passed
slowly
the
sun
sank
the
wind
ceased
after
an
interminable
time
the
stars
appeared
and
still
he
could
not
sleep
he
had
chosen
a
spot
under
an
oak
on
the
green
slope
the
night
was
warm
and
even
sultry
so
that
he
did
not
miss
his
covering
but
there
was
no
rest
in
him
towards
the
dawn
which
comes
very
early
at
that
season
he
at
last
slept
with
his
back
to
the
tree
he
awoke
with
a
start
in
broad
daylight
to
see
a
man
standing
in
front
of
him
armed
with
a
long
spear
felix
sprang
to
his
feet
instinctively
feeling
for
his
but
he
saw
in
an
instant
that
no
injury
was
meant
for
the
man
was
leaning
on
the
shaft
of
his
weapon
and
of
course
could
if
so
he
had
wished
have
run
him
through
while
sleeping
they
looked
at
each
other
for
a
moment
the
stranger
was
clad
in
a
tunic
and
wore
a
hat
of
plaited
straw
he
was
very
tall
and
strongly
built
his
single
weapon
a
spear
of
twice
his
own
length
his
beard
came
down
on
his
chest
he
spoke
to
felix
in
a
dialect
the
latter
did
not
understand
felix
held
out
his
hand
as
a
token
of
amity
which
the
other
took
he
spoke
again
felix
on
his
part
tried
to
explain
his
shipwreck
when
a
word
the
stranger
uttered
recalled
to
felix
memory
the
peculiar
dialect
used
by
the
shepherd
race
on
the
hills
in
the
neighbourhood
of
his
home
he
spoke
in
this
dialect
which
the
stranger
in
part
at
least
understood
and
the
sound
of
which
at
once
rendered
him
more
friendly
by
degrees
they
comprehended
each
other
meaning
the
easier
as
the
shepherd
had
come
the
same
way
and
had
seen
the
wreck
of
the
canoe
felix
learned
that
the
shepherd
was
a
scout
sent
on
ahead
to
see
that
the
road
was
clear
of
enemies
his
tribe
were
on
the
march
with
their
flocks
and
to
avoid
the
steep
woods
and
hills
which
there
blocked
their
course
they
had
followed
the
level
and
open
beach
at
the
foot
of
the
cliff
aware
of
course
of
the
gap
which
felix
had
found
while
they
were
talking
felix
saw
the
cloud
of
dust
raised
by
the
sheep
as
the
flocks
wound
round
a
jutting
buttress
of
cliff
his
friend
explained
that
they
marched
in
the
night
and
early
morning
to
avoid
the
heat
of
the
day
their
proposed
was
close
at
hand
he
must
go
on
and
see
that
all
was
clear
felix
accompanied
him
and
found
within
the
wood
at
the
summit
a
grassy
coombe
where
a
spring
rose
the
shepherd
threw
down
his
spear
and
began
to
dam
up
the
channel
of
the
spring
with
stones
flints
and
sods
of
earth
in
order
to
form
a
pool
at
which
the
sheep
might
drink
felix
assisted
him
and
the
water
speedily
began
to
rise
the
flocks
were
not
allowed
to
rush
tumultuously
to
the
water
they
came
in
about
fifty
at
a
time
each
division
with
its
shepherds
and
their
dogs
so
that
confusion
was
avoided
and
all
had
their
share
there
were
about
twenty
of
these
divisions
besides
eighty
cows
and
a
few
goats
they
had
no
horses
their
baggage
came
on
the
backs
of
asses
after
the
whole
of
the
flocks
and
herds
had
been
watered
several
fires
were
lit
by
the
women
who
in
stature
and
hardihood
scarcely
differed
from
the
men
not
till
this
work
was
over
did
the
others
gather
about
felix
to
hear
his
story
finding
that
he
was
hungry
they
ran
to
the
baggage
for
food
and
pressed
on
him
a
little
dark
bread
plentiful
cheese
and
butter
dried
tongue
and
horns
of
mead
he
could
not
devour
a
fiftieth
part
of
what
these
hospitable
people
brought
him
having
nothing
else
to
give
them
he
took
from
his
pocket
one
of
the
gold
coins
he
had
brought
from
the
site
of
the
ancient
city
and
offered
it
they
laughed
and
made
him
understand
that
it
was
of
no
value
to
them
but
they
passed
it
from
hand
to
hand
and
he
noticed
that
they
began
to
look
at
him
curiously
from
its
blackened
appearance
they
conjectured
whence
he
had
obtained
it
one
too
pointed
to
his
shoes
which
were
still
blackened
and
appeared
to
have
been
scorched
the
whole
camp
now
pressed
on
him
their
wonder
and
interest
rising
to
a
great
height
with
some
trouble
felix
described
his
journey
over
the
site
of
the
ancient
city
interrupted
with
constant
exclamations
questions
and
excited
conversation
he
told
them
everything
except
about
the
diamond
their
manner
towards
him
perceptibly
altered
from
the
first
they
had
been
hospitable
they
now
became
respectful
and
even
reverent
the
elders
and
their
chief
not
to
be
distinguished
by
dress
or
ornament
from
the
rest
treated
him
with
ceremony
and
marked
deference
the
children
were
brought
to
see
and
even
to
touch
him
so
great
was
their
amazement
that
any
one
should
have
escaped
from
these
pestilential
vapours
that
they
attributed
it
to
divine
interposition
and
looked
upon
him
with
some
of
the
awe
of
superstition
he
was
asked
to
stay
with
them
altogether
and
to
take
command
of
the
tribe
the
latter
felix
declined
to
stay
with
them
for
awhile
at
least
he
was
of
course
willing
enough
he
mentioned
his
hidden
possessions
and
got
up
to
return
for
them
but
they
would
not
permit
him
two
men
started
at
once
he
gave
them
the
bearings
of
the
spot
and
they
had
not
the
least
doubt
but
that
they
should
find
it
especially
as
the
wind
being
still
the
canoe
would
not
yet
have
broken
up
and
would
guide
them
the
tribe
remained
in
the
green
coombe
the
whole
day
resting
from
their
long
journey
they
wearied
felix
with
questions
still
he
answered
them
as
copiously
as
he
could
he
felt
too
grateful
for
their
kindness
not
to
satisfy
them
his
bow
was
handled
his
arrows
carried
about
so
that
the
quiver
for
the
time
was
empty
and
the
arrows
scattered
in
twenty
hands
he
astonished
them
by
exhibiting
his
skill
with
the
weapon
striking
a
tree
with
an
arrow
at
nearly
three
hundred
yards
though
familiar
of
course
with
the
bow
they
had
never
seen
shooting
like
that
nor
indeed
any
archery
except
at
short
quarters
they
had
no
other
arms
themselves
but
spears
and
knives
seeing
one
of
the
women
cutting
the
boughs
from
a
fallen
tree
dead
and
dry
and
therefore
preferable
for
fuel
felix
naturally
went
to
help
her
and
taking
the
axe
soon
made
a
bundle
which
he
carried
for
her
it
was
his
duty
as
a
noble
to
see
than
no
woman
not
a
slave
laboured
he
had
been
bred
in
that
idea
and
would
have
felt
disgraced
had
he
permitted
it
the
women
looked
on
with
astonishment
for
in
these
rude
tribes
the
labour
of
the
women
was
considered
valuable
and
appraised
like
that
of
a
horse
without
any
conscious
design
felix
thus
in
one
day
conciliated
and
won
the
regard
of
the
two
most
powerful
parties
in
the
camp
the
chief
and
the
women
by
his
refusing
the
command
the
chief
was
flattered
and
his
possible
hostility
prevented
the
act
of
cutting
the
wood
and
carrying
the
bundle
gave
him
the
hearts
of
the
women
they
did
not
indeed
think
their
labour
in
any
degree
oppressive
still
to
be
relieved
of
it
was
pleasing
the
two
men
who
had
gone
for
felix
buried
treasure
did
not
return
till
breakfast
next
morning
they
stepped
into
the
camp
each
with
his
spear
reddened
and
dripping
with
fresh
blood
felix
no
sooner
saw
the
blood
than
he
fainted
he
quickly
recovered
but
he
could
not
endure
the
sight
of
the
spears
which
were
removed
and
hidden
from
his
view
he
had
seen
blood
enough
spilt
at
the
siege
of
iwis
but
this
came
upon
him
in
all
its
horror
unrelieved
by
the
excitement
of
war
the
two
shepherds
had
been
dogged
by
gipsies
and
had
been
obliged
to
make
a
round
to
escape
they
took
their
revenge
by
climbing
into
trees
and
as
their
pursuers
passed
under
thrust
them
through
with
their
long
spears
the
shepherds
like
all
their
related
tribes
had
been
at
feud
with
the
gipsies
for
many
generations
the
gipsies
followed
them
to
and
from
their
pastures
cut
off
stragglers
destroyed
or
stole
their
sheep
and
cattle
and
now
and
then
overwhelmed
a
whole
tribe
of
late
the
contest
had
become
more
sanguinary
and
almost
ceaseless
mounted
on
swift
though
small
horses
the
gipsies
had
the
advantage
of
the
shepherds
on
the
other
hand
the
shepherds
being
men
of
great
stature
and
strength
could
not
be
carried
away
by
a
rush
if
they
had
time
to
form
a
circle
as
was
their
custom
of
battle
they
lost
many
men
by
the
javelins
thrown
by
the
gipsies
who
rode
up
to
the
edge
of
the
circle
cast
their
darts
and
retreated
if
the
shepherds
left
their
circle
they
were
easily
ridden
over
while
they
maintained
formation
they
lost
individuals
but
saved
the
mass
battles
were
of
rare
occurrence
the
gipsies
watched
for
opportunities
and
executed
raids
the
shepherds
retaliated
and
thus
the
endless
war
continued
the
shepherds
invariably
posted
sentinels
and
sent
forward
scouts
to
ascertain
if
the
way
were
clear
accustomed
to
the
horrid
scenes
of
war
from
childhood
they
could
not
understand
felix
sensitiveness
they
laughed
and
then
petted
him
like
a
spoilt
child
this
galled
him
exceedingly
he
felt
humiliated
and
eager
to
reassert
his
manhood
he
was
willing
to
stay
with
them
there
for
awhile
nothing
would
have
induced
him
to
leave
them
now
till
he
had
vindicated
himself
in
their
sight
the
incident
happened
soon
after
sunrise
which
is
very
early
at
the
end
of
june
the
camp
had
only
waited
for
the
return
of
these
men
and
on
their
appearance
began
to
move
the
march
that
morning
was
not
a
long
one
as
the
sky
was
clear
and
the
heat
soon
wearied
the
flocks
felix
accompanied
the
scout
in
advance
armed
with
his
bow
eager
to
encounter
the
gipsies
chapter
xxvi
bow
and
arrow
three
mornings
the
shepherds
marched
in
the
same
manner
when
they
came
in
view
of
a
range
of
hills
so
high
that
to
felix
they
appeared
mountains
the
home
of
the
tribe
was
in
these
hills
and
once
there
they
were
comparatively
safe
from
attack
in
early
spring
when
the
herbage
on
the
downs
was
scarce
the
flocks
moved
to
the
meadowlike
lands
far
in
the
valleys
in
summer
they
returned
to
the
hills
in
autumn
they
went
to
the
vales
again
soon
after
noon
on
the
third
day
the
scouts
reported
that
a
large
body
of
gipsies
were
moving
in
a
direction
which
would
cut
off
their
course
to
the
hills
on
the
morrow
the
chief
held
a
council
and
it
was
determined
that
a
forced
march
should
be
made
at
once
by
another
route
more
to
the
left
and
it
was
thought
that
in
this
way
they
might
reach
the
base
of
the
slopes
by
evening
the
distance
was
not
great
and
could
easily
have
been
traversed
by
the
men
the
flocks
and
herds
however
could
not
be
hurried
much
a
messenger
was
despatched
to
the
hills
for
assistance
and
the
march
began
it
was
a
tedious
movement
felix
was
wearied
and
walked
in
a
drowsy
state
towards
six
as
he
guessed
the
trees
began
to
thin
and
the
column
reached
the
first
slopes
of
the
hills
here
about
thirty
shepherds
joined
them
a
contingent
from
the
nearest
camp
it
was
considered
that
the
danger
was
now
past
and
that
the
gipsies
would
not
attack
them
on
the
hill
but
it
was
a
mistake
a
large
body
almost
immediately
appeared
coming
along
the
slope
on
the
right
not
less
than
two
hundred
and
from
their
open
movements
and
numbers
it
was
evident
that
they
intended
battle
the
flocks
and
herds
were
driven
hastily
into
a
coombe
or
narrow
valley
and
there
left
to
their
fate
all
the
armed
men
formed
in
a
circle
the
women
occupied
the
centre
felix
took
his
stand
outside
the
circle
by
a
gnarled
and
decayed
oak
there
was
just
there
a
slight
rise
in
the
ground
which
he
knew
would
give
him
some
advantage
in
discharging
his
arrows
and
would
also
allow
him
a
clear
view
his
friends
earnestly
entreated
him
to
enter
the
circle
and
even
sought
to
bring
him
within
it
by
force
till
he
explained
to
them
that
he
could
not
shoot
if
so
surrounded
and
promised
if
the
gipsies
charged
to
rush
inside
felix
unslung
his
quiver
and
placed
it
on
the
ground
before
him
a
second
quiver
he
put
beside
it
four
or
five
arrows
he
stuck
upright
in
the
sward
so
that
he
could
catch
hold
of
them
quickly
two
arrows
he
held
in
his
left
hand
another
he
fitted
to
the
string
thus
prepared
he
watched
the
gipsies
advance
they
came
walking
their
short
wiry
horses
to
within
half
a
mile
when
they
began
to
trot
down
the
slope
they
could
not
surround
the
shepherds
because
of
the
coombe
and
some
brushwood
and
could
advance
only
on
two
fronts
felix
rapidly
became
so
excited
that
his
sight
was
affected
and
his
head
whirled
his
heart
beat
with
such
speed
that
his
breath
seemed
going
his
limbs
tottered
and
he
dreaded
lest
he
should
faint
his
intensely
nervous
organization
strung
up
to
its
highest
pitch
shook
him
in
its
grasp
and
his
will
was
powerless
to
control
it
he
felt
that
he
should
disgrace
himself
once
more
before
these
rugged
but
brave
shepherds
who
betrayed
not
the
slightest
symptom
of
agitation
for
one
hour
of
oliver
calm
courage
and
utter
absence
of
nervousness
he
would
have
given
years
of
his
life
his
friends
in
the
circle
observed
his
agitation
and
renewed
their
entreaties
to
him
to
come
inside
it
this
only
was
needed
to
complete
his
discomfiture
he
lost
his
head
altogether
he
saw
nothing
but
a
confused
mass
of
yellow
and
red
rushing
towards
him
for
each
of
the
gipsies
wore
a
yellow
or
red
scarf
some
about
the
body
some
over
the
shoulder
others
round
the
head
they
were
now
within
three
hundred
yards
a
murmur
from
the
shepherd
spearmen
felix
had
discharged
an
arrow
it
stuck
in
the
ground
about
twenty
paces
from
him
he
shot
again
it
flew
wild
and
quivering
and
dropped
harmlessly
another
murmur
they
expressed
to
each
other
their
contempt
for
the
bow
this
immediately
restored
felix
he
forgot
the
enemy
as
an
enemy
he
forgot
himself
he
thought
only
of
his
skill
as
an
archer
now
in
question
pride
upheld
him
the
third
arrow
he
fitted
properly
to
the
string
he
planted
his
left
foot
slightly
in
advance
and
looked
steadfastly
at
the
horsemen
before
he
drew
his
bow
at
a
distance
of
one
hundred
and
fifty
yards
they
had
paused
and
were
widening
out
so
as
to
advance
in
loose
open
rank
and
allow
each
man
to
throw
his
javelin
they
shouted
the
spearmen
in
the
circle
replied
and
levelled
their
spears
felix
fixed
his
eye
on
one
of
the
gipsies
who
was
ordering
and
marshalling
the
rest
a
chief
he
drew
the
arrow
swiftly
but
quietly
the
string
hummed
the
pliant
yew
obeyed
and
the
long
arrow
shot
forward
in
a
steady
swift
flight
like
a
line
of
gossamer
drawn
through
the
air
it
missed
the
chief
but
pierced
the
horse
he
rode
just
in
front
of
the
rider
thigh
the
maddened
horse
reared
and
fell
backwards
on
his
rider
the
spearmen
shouted
before
the
sound
could
leave
their
lips
another
arrow
had
sped
a
gipsy
threw
up
his
arms
with
a
shriek
the
arrow
had
gone
through
his
body
a
third
a
fourth
a
fifth
six
gipsies
rolled
on
the
sward
shout
upon
shout
rent
the
air
from
the
spearmen
utterly
unused
to
this
mode
of
fighting
the
gipsies
fell
back
still
the
fatal
arrows
pursued
them
and
ere
they
were
out
of
range
three
others
fell
now
the
rage
of
battle
burned
in
felix
his
eyes
gleamed
his
lips
were
open
his
nostrils
wide
like
a
horse
running
a
race
he
shouted
to
the
spearmen
to
follow
him
and
snatching
up
his
quiver
ran
forward
gathered
together
in
a
group
the
gipsy
band
consulted
felix
ran
at
full
speed
swift
of
foot
he
left
the
heavy
spearmen
behind
alone
he
approached
the
horsemen
all
the
aquila
courage
was
up
within
him
he
kept
the
higher
ground
as
he
ran
and
stopped
suddenly
on
a
little
knoll
or
tumulus
his
arrow
flew
a
gipsy
fell
again
and
a
third
their
anger
gave
them
fresh
courage
to
be
repulsed
by
one
only
twenty
of
them
started
to
charge
and
run
him
down
the
keen
arrows
flew
faster
than
their
horses
feet
now
the
horse
and
now
the
man
met
those
sharp
points
six
fell
the
rest
returned
the
shepherds
came
running
felix
ordered
them
to
charge
the
gipsies
his
success
gave
him
authority
they
obeyed
and
as
they
charged
he
shot
nine
more
arrows
nine
more
deadly
wounds
suddenly
the
gipsy
band
turned
and
fled
into
the
brushwood
on
the
lower
slopes
breathless
felix
sat
down
on
the
knoll
and
the
spearmen
swarmed
around
him
hardly
had
they
begun
to
speak
to
him
than
there
was
a
shout
and
they
saw
a
body
of
shepherds
descending
the
hill
there
were
three
hundred
of
them
warned
by
the
messenger
the
whole
country
had
risen
to
repel
the
gipsies
too
late
to
join
in
the
fight
they
had
seen
the
last
of
it
they
examined
the
field
there
were
ten
dead
and
six
wounded
who
were
taken
prisoners
the
rest
escaped
though
hurt
in
many
cases
the
arrow
had
gone
clean
through
the
body
then
for
the
first
time
they
understood
the
immense
power
of
the
yew
bow
in
strong
and
skilful
hands
felix
was
overwhelmed
they
almost
crushed
him
with
their
attentions
the
women
fell
at
his
feet
and
kissed
them
but
the
archer
could
scarcely
reply
his
intense
nervous
excitement
had
left
him
weak
and
almost
faint
his
one
idea
was
to
rest
as
he
walked
back
to
the
camp
between
the
chiefs
of
the
shepherd
spearmen
his
eyes
closed
his
limbs
tottered
and
they
had
to
support
him
at
the
camp
he
threw
himself
on
the
sward
under
the
gnarled
oak
and
was
instantly
fast
asleep
immediately
the
camp
was
stilled
not
to
disturb
him
his
adventures
in
the
marshes
of
the
buried
city
his
canoe
his
archery
were
talked
of
the
livelong
night
next
morning
the
camp
set
out
for
their
home
in
the
mountains
and
he
was
escorted
by
nearly
four
hundred
spearmen
they
had
saved
for
him
the
ornaments
of
the
gipsies
who
had
fallen
golden
earrings
and
he
gave
them
to
the
women
except
one
a
set
with
turquoise
and
evidently
of
ancient
make
which
he
kept
for
aurora
two
marches
brought
them
to
the
home
of
the
tribe
where
the
rest
of
the
spearmen
left
them
the
place
was
called
wolfstead
felix
saw
at
once
how
easily
this
spot
might
be
fortified
there
was
a
deep
and
narrow
valley
like
a
groove
or
green
trench
opening
to
the
south
at
the
upper
end
of
the
valley
rose
a
hill
not
very
high
but
steep
narrow
at
the
ridge
and
steep
again
on
the
other
side
over
it
was
a
broad
wooded
and
beautiful
vale
beyond
that
again
the
higher
mountains
towards
the
foot
of
the
narrow
ridge
here
there
was
a
succession
of
chalk
cliffs
so
that
to
climb
up
on
that
side
in
the
face
of
opposition
would
be
extremely
difficult
in
the
gorge
of
the
enclosed
narrow
valley
a
spring
rose
the
shepherds
had
formed
eight
pools
one
after
the
other
water
being
of
great
importance
to
them
and
farther
down
where
the
valley
opened
there
were
forty
or
fifty
acres
of
irrigated
meadow
the
spring
then
ran
into
a
considerable
brook
across
which
was
the
forest
felix
idea
was
to
run
a
palisade
along
the
margin
of
the
brook
and
up
both
sides
of
the
valley
to
the
ridge
there
he
would
build
a
fort
the
edges
of
the
chalk
cliffs
he
would
connect
with
a
palisade
or
a
wall
and
so
form
a
complete
enclosure
he
mentioned
his
scheme
to
the
shepherds
they
did
not
greatly
care
for
it
as
they
had
always
been
secure
without
it
the
rugged
nature
of
the
country
not
permitting
horsemen
to
penetrate
but
they
were
so
completely
under
his
influence
that
to
please
him
they
set
about
the
work
he
had
to
show
them
how
to
make
a
palisade
they
had
never
seen
one
and
he
made
the
first
part
of
it
himself
at
building
a
wall
with
loose
stones
without
mortar
the
shepherds
were
skilful
the
wall
along
the
verge
of
the
cliffs
was
soon
up
and
so
was
the
fort
on
the
top
of
the
ridge
the
fort
consisted
merely
of
a
circular
wall
breast
high
with
embrasures
or
crenellations
when
this
was
finished
felix
had
a
sense
of
mastership
for
in
this
fort
he
felt
as
if
he
could
rule
the
whole
country
from
day
to
day
shepherds
came
from
the
more
distant
parts
to
see
the
famous
archer
and
to
admire
the
enclosure
though
the
idea
of
it
had
never
occurred
to
them
now
they
saw
it
they
fully
understood
its
advantages
and
two
other
chiefs
began
to
erect
similar
forts
and
palisades
chapter
xxvii
surprised
felix
was
now
anxious
to
continue
his
journey
yet
he
did
not
like
to
leave
the
shepherds
with
whom
his
life
was
so
pleasant
as
usual
when
deliberating
he
wandered
about
the
hills
and
then
into
the
forest
the
shepherds
at
first
insisted
on
at
least
two
of
their
number
accompanying
him
they
were
fearful
lest
the
gipsies
should
seize
him
or
a
bushman
assassinate
him
this
company
was
irksome
to
felix
in
time
he
convinced
them
that
he
was
a
much
better
hunter
than
any
of
the
tribe
and
they
permitted
him
to
roam
alone
during
one
of
these
excursions
into
the
forest
he
discovered
a
beautiful
lake
he
looked
down
on
the
water
from
the
summit
of
one
of
the
green
mountains
it
was
he
thought
half
a
mile
across
and
the
opposite
shore
was
open
woodland
grassy
and
and
dotted
with
fine
old
oaks
by
degrees
these
closed
together
and
the
forest
succeeded
beyond
it
again
at
a
distance
of
two
miles
were
green
hills
a
little
clearing
only
was
wanted
to
make
the
place
fit
for
a
castle
and
enclosure
through
the
opposite
he
traced
the
course
of
a
large
brook
down
to
the
lake
another
entered
it
on
the
right
and
the
lake
gradually
narrowed
to
a
river
on
his
left
could
he
erect
a
tower
there
and
bring
aurora
to
it
how
happy
he
would
be
a
more
beautiful
spot
he
had
never
seen
nor
one
more
suited
for
every
purpose
in
life
he
followed
the
course
of
the
stream
which
left
the
lake
every
now
and
then
disturbing
wild
goats
from
the
cliffs
and
twice
he
saw
deer
under
the
oaks
across
it
on
rounding
a
spur
of
down
he
saw
that
the
river
debouched
into
a
much
wider
lake
which
he
conjectured
must
be
the
sweet
waters
he
went
on
till
he
reached
the
mouth
of
the
river
and
had
then
no
doubt
that
he
was
standing
once
more
on
the
shore
of
the
sweet
water
sea
on
this
the
southern
side
the
banks
were
low
on
the
other
a
steep
chalky
cliff
almost
overhung
the
river
and
jutted
out
into
the
lake
curving
somewhat
towards
him
a
fort
on
that
cliff
would
command
the
entrance
to
the
river
the
cliff
was
a
natural
breakwater
so
that
there
was
a
haven
at
its
base
the
river
appeared
broad
and
deep
enough
for
navigation
so
that
vessels
could
pass
from
the
great
lake
to
the
inland
water
about
six
or
seven
miles
he
supposed
felix
was
much
taken
with
this
spot
the
beauty
of
the
inland
lake
the
evident
richness
of
the
soil
the
river
communicating
with
the
great
lake
the
cliff
commanding
its
entrance
never
in
all
his
wanderings
had
he
seen
a
district
so
well
suited
for
a
settlement
and
the
founding
of
a
city
if
he
had
but
a
thousand
men
how
soon
he
would
bring
aurora
there
and
build
a
tower
and
erect
a
palisade
so
occupied
was
he
with
the
thought
that
he
returned
the
whole
distance
to
the
spot
where
he
had
made
the
discovery
there
he
remained
a
long
time
designing
it
all
in
his
mind
the
tower
he
would
build
yonder
of
a
mile
perhaps
a
mile
inland
from
the
opposite
shore
on
a
green
knoll
at
the
base
of
which
the
brook
flowed
it
would
be
even
more
pleasant
there
than
on
the
shore
of
the
lake
the
forest
he
would
clear
back
a
little
and
put
up
a
stout
palisade
enclosing
at
least
three
miles
of
grassy
land
by
the
shore
of
the
lake
he
would
build
his
town
so
that
his
vessels
might
be
able
to
go
forth
into
the
great
sweet
water
sea
so
strongly
did
imagination
hold
him
that
he
did
not
observe
how
near
it
was
to
sunset
nor
did
he
remark
the
threatening
aspect
of
the
sky
thunder
awoke
him
from
his
dream
he
looked
and
saw
a
storm
rapidly
coming
from
the
he
descended
the
hill
and
sheltered
himself
as
well
as
possible
among
some
thick
after
the
lightning
the
rain
poured
so
heavily
that
it
penetrated
the
branches
and
he
unstrung
his
bow
and
placed
the
string
in
his
pocket
that
it
might
not
become
wet
instantly
there
was
a
whoop
on
either
side
and
two
gipsies
darted
from
the
undergrowth
towards
him
while
the
terrible
bow
was
bent
they
had
followed
him
tracking
his
footsteps
the
moment
he
unstrung
the
bow
they
rushed
out
felix
crushed
through
between
the
firs
by
main
force
getting
through
but
only
opening
a
passage
for
them
to
follow
they
could
easily
have
thrust
their
darts
through
him
but
their
object
was
to
take
him
alive
and
gratify
the
revenge
of
the
tribes
with
torture
felix
doubled
from
the
firs
and
made
towards
the
camp
but
he
was
faced
by
three
more
gipsies
he
turned
again
and
made
for
the
steep
hill
he
had
descended
with
all
his
strength
he
raced
up
it
his
lightness
of
foot
carried
him
in
advance
and
he
reached
the
summit
a
hundred
yards
ahead
but
he
knew
he
must
be
overtaken
presently
unless
he
could
hit
upon
some
stratagem
in
the
instant
that
he
paused
to
breathe
on
the
summit
a
thought
struck
him
like
the
wind
he
raced
along
the
ridge
making
for
the
great
sweet
water
the
same
path
he
had
followed
in
the
morning
once
on
the
ridge
the
five
pursuers
shouted
they
knew
they
should
have
him
now
there
were
no
more
hills
to
breast
it
was
not
so
easy
as
they
imagined
felix
was
in
splendid
training
he
kept
his
lead
and
even
drew
a
little
on
them
still
he
knew
in
time
he
must
succumb
just
as
the
stag
though
swifter
of
foot
ultimately
succumbs
to
the
hounds
they
would
track
him
till
they
had
him
if
only
he
could
gain
enough
to
have
time
to
string
and
bend
his
bow
but
with
all
his
efforts
he
could
not
get
away
more
than
the
hundred
yards
and
that
was
not
far
enough
it
could
be
traversed
in
ten
seconds
they
would
have
him
before
he
could
string
it
and
fit
an
arrow
if
only
he
had
been
fresh
as
in
the
morning
but
he
had
had
a
long
walk
during
the
day
and
not
much
food
he
knew
that
his
burst
of
speed
must
soon
slacken
but
he
had
a
stratagem
yet
keeping
along
the
ridge
till
he
reached
the
place
where
the
lake
narrowed
to
the
river
suddenly
he
rushed
down
the
hill
towards
the
water
the
edge
was
encumbered
with
brushwood
and
fallen
trees
he
scrambled
over
and
through
anyhow
he
tore
a
path
through
the
bushes
and
plunged
in
but
his
jacket
caught
in
a
branch
he
had
his
knife
out
and
cut
off
the
shred
of
cloth
then
with
the
bow
and
knife
in
one
hand
he
struck
out
for
the
opposite
shore
his
hope
was
that
the
gipsies
being
horsemen
and
passing
all
their
lives
on
their
horses
might
not
know
how
to
swim
his
conjecture
was
right
they
stopped
on
the
brink
and
yelled
their
loudest
when
he
had
passed
the
middle
of
the
slow
stream
their
rage
rose
to
a
shriek
startling
a
heron
far
down
the
water
felix
reached
the
opposite
shore
in
safety
but
the
was
now
wet
and
useless
he
struck
off
at
once
straight
across
the
past
the
oaks
he
had
admired
past
the
green
knoll
where
in
imagination
he
had
built
his
castle
and
brought
aurora
through
the
brook
which
he
found
was
larger
than
it
appeared
at
a
distance
and
required
two
or
three
strokes
to
cross
a
few
more
paces
and
the
forest
sheltered
him
under
the
trees
he
rested
and
considered
what
course
to
pursue
the
gipsies
would
expect
him
to
endeavour
to
regain
his
friends
and
would
watch
to
cut
off
his
return
felix
determined
to
make
instead
for
another
camp
farther
east
and
to
get
even
there
by
a
detour
bitterly
he
reproached
himself
for
his
folly
in
leaving
the
camp
knowing
that
gipsies
were
about
with
no
other
weapon
than
the
bow
the
knife
at
his
belt
was
practically
no
weapon
at
all
useful
only
in
the
last
extremity
had
he
a
short
sword
or
javelin
he
would
have
faced
the
two
gipsies
who
first
sprang
towards
him
worse
than
this
was
the
folly
of
wandering
without
the
least
precaution
into
a
territory
at
that
time
full
of
gipsies
who
had
every
reason
to
desire
his
capture
if
he
had
used
the
ordinary
precautions
of
woodcraft
he
would
have
noticed
their
traces
and
he
would
not
have
exposed
himself
in
full
view
on
the
ridges
of
the
hills
where
a
man
was
visible
for
miles
if
he
perished
through
his
carelessness
how
bitter
it
would
be
to
lose
aurora
by
the
merest
folly
would
indeed
be
humiliating
he
braced
himself
to
the
journey
before
him
and
set
off
at
a
good
swinging
hunter
pace
as
it
is
called
that
is
a
pace
rather
more
than
a
walk
and
less
than
a
run
with
the
limbs
somewhat
bent
and
long
springy
steps
the
forest
was
in
the
worst
possible
condition
for
movement
the
rain
had
damped
the
fern
and
undergrowth
and
every
branch
showered
raindrops
upon
him
it
was
now
past
sunset
and
the
dusk
was
increasing
this
he
welcomed
as
hiding
him
he
travelled
on
till
nearly
dawn
and
then
turning
to
the
right
swept
round
and
regained
the
line
of
the
mountainous
hills
after
sunrise
there
he
rested
and
reached
a
camp
about
nine
in
the
morning
having
walked
altogether
since
the
preceding
morning
fully
fifty
miles
this
camp
was
about
fifteen
miles
distant
from
that
of
his
friends
the
shepherds
knew
him
and
one
of
them
started
with
the
news
of
his
safety
in
the
afternoon
ten
of
his
friends
came
over
to
see
him
and
to
reproach
him
his
weariness
was
so
great
that
for
three
days
he
scarcely
moved
from
the
hut
during
which
time
the
weather
was
wet
and
stormy
as
is
often
the
case
in
summer
after
a
thunderstorm
on
the
fourth
morning
it
was
fine
and
felix
now
quite
restored
to
his
usual
strength
went
out
with
the
shepherds
he
found
some
of
them
engaged
in
throwing
up
a
heap
of
stones
flint
and
chalk
lumps
near
an
in
a
plain
at
the
foot
of
the
hill
they
told
him
that
during
the
thunderstorm
two
cows
and
ten
sheep
had
been
killed
there
by
lightning
which
had
scarcely
injured
the
oak
it
was
their
custom
to
pile
up
a
heap
of
stones
wherever
such
an
event
occurred
to
warn
others
from
staying
themselves
or
allowing
their
sheep
or
cattle
to
stay
near
the
spot
in
thunder
as
it
was
observed
that
where
lightning
struck
once
it
was
sure
to
strike
again
sooner
or
later
then
said
felix
you
may
be
sure
there
is
water
there
he
knew
from
his
study
of
the
knowledge
of
the
ancients
that
lightning
frequently
leaped
from
trees
or
buildings
to
concealed
water
but
he
had
no
intention
of
indicating
water
in
that
particular
spot
he
meant
the
remark
in
a
general
sense
but
the
shepherds
ever
desirous
of
water
and
looking
on
felix
as
a
being
of
a
different
order
to
themselves
took
his
casual
observation
in
its
literal
sense
they
brought
their
tools
and
dug
and
as
it
chanced
found
a
copious
spring
the
water
gushed
forth
and
formed
a
streamlet
upon
this
the
whole
tribe
gathered
and
they
saluted
felix
as
one
almost
divine
it
was
in
vain
that
he
endeavoured
to
repel
this
homage
and
to
explain
the
reason
of
his
remark
and
that
it
was
only
in
a
general
way
that
he
intended
it
facts
were
too
strong
for
him
they
had
heard
his
words
which
they
considered
an
inspiration
and
was
the
water
it
was
no
use
was
the
spring
the
very
thing
they
most
wanted
perforce
felix
was
invested
with
attributes
beyond
nature
the
report
spread
his
own
old
friends
came
in
a
crowd
to
see
the
new
spring
others
journeyed
from
afar
in
a
week
felix
having
meanwhile
returned
to
wolfstead
his
fame
had
for
the
second
time
spread
all
over
the
district
some
came
a
hundred
miles
to
see
him
nothing
he
could
say
was
listened
to
these
simple
straightforward
people
understood
nothing
but
facts
and
the
defeat
of
the
gipsies
and
the
discovery
of
the
spring
seemed
to
them
little
less
than
supernatural
besides
which
in
innumerable
little
ways
felix
superior
knowledge
had
told
upon
them
his
very
manners
spoke
of
high
training
his
persuasive
voice
won
them
his
constructive
skill
and
power
of
planning
as
shown
in
the
palisades
and
enclosure
showed
a
grasp
of
circumstances
new
to
them
this
was
a
man
such
as
they
had
never
before
seen
they
began
to
bring
him
disputes
to
settle
he
shrank
from
this
position
of
judge
but
it
was
useless
to
struggle
they
would
wait
as
long
as
he
liked
but
his
decision
they
would
have
and
no
other
next
came
the
sick
begging
to
be
cured
here
felix
was
firm
he
would
not
attempt
to
be
a
physician
and
they
went
away
but
unfortunately
it
happened
that
he
let
out
his
knowledge
of
plants
and
back
they
came
felix
did
not
know
what
course
to
pursue
if
by
chance
he
did
any
one
good
crowds
would
beset
him
if
injury
resulted
perhaps
he
would
be
assassinated
this
fear
was
quite
unfounded
he
really
had
not
the
smallest
idea
of
how
high
he
stood
in
their
estimation
after
much
consideration
felix
hit
upon
a
method
which
would
save
him
from
many
inconveniences
he
announced
his
intention
of
forming
a
in
which
to
grow
the
best
kind
of
herbs
and
at
the
same
time
said
he
would
not
administer
any
medicine
himself
but
would
tell
their
own
native
physicians
and
nurses
all
he
knew
so
that
they
could
use
his
knowledge
the
was
at
once
begun
in
the
valley
it
could
not
contain
much
till
next
year
and
meantime
if
any
diseased
persons
came
felix
saw
them
expressed
his
opinion
to
the
old
shepherd
who
was
the
doctor
of
the
tribe
and
the
latter
carried
out
his
instructions
felix
did
succeed
in
relieving
some
small
ailments
and
thereby
added
to
his
reputation
chapter
xxviii
for
aurora
felix
now
began
to
find
out
for
himself
the
ancient
truth
that
difficulties
always
confront
man
success
only
changes
them
and
increases
their
number
difficulties
faced
him
in
every
direction
at
home
it
had
seemed
impossible
for
him
to
do
anything
now
that
success
seemed
to
smile
on
him
and
he
had
become
a
power
instead
of
everything
being
smooth
and
easy
new
difficulties
sprang
up
for
solution
at
every
point
he
wished
to
continue
his
journey
but
he
feared
that
he
would
not
be
permitted
to
depart
he
would
have
to
start
away
in
the
night
in
which
case
he
could
hardly
return
to
them
again
and
yet
he
wished
to
return
to
these
the
first
friends
he
had
had
and
amongst
whom
he
hoped
to
found
a
city
another
week
slipped
away
and
felix
was
meditating
his
escape
when
one
afternoon
a
deputation
of
ten
spearmen
arrived
from
a
distant
tribe
who
had
nominated
him
their
king
and
sent
their
principal
men
to
convey
the
intelligence
fame
is
always
greatest
at
a
distance
and
this
tribe
in
the
mountains
of
the
east
had
actually
chosen
him
as
king
and
declared
that
they
would
obey
him
whether
he
took
up
his
residence
with
them
or
not
felix
was
naturally
greatly
pleased
how
delighted
aurora
would
be
but
he
was
in
perplexity
what
to
do
for
he
could
not
tell
whether
the
wolfstead
people
would
be
favourably
inclined
or
would
resent
his
selection
he
had
not
long
to
consider
there
was
an
assembly
of
the
tribe
and
they
too
chose
him
by
common
consent
as
their
king
secretly
they
were
annoyed
that
another
tribe
had
been
more
forward
than
themselves
and
were
anxious
that
felix
should
not
leave
them
felix
declined
the
honour
in
spite
of
his
refusal
he
was
treated
as
if
he
were
the
most
despotic
monarch
four
days
afterwards
two
other
tribes
joined
the
movement
and
sent
their
acceptance
of
him
as
their
monarch
others
followed
and
so
quickly
now
that
a
day
never
passed
without
another
tribe
sending
a
deputation
felix
thought
deeply
on
the
matter
he
was
of
course
flattered
and
ready
to
accept
the
dignity
but
he
was
alive
to
considerations
of
policy
he
resolved
that
he
would
not
use
the
title
nor
exercise
the
functions
of
a
king
as
usually
understood
he
explained
his
plan
to
the
chiefs
it
was
that
he
should
be
called
simply
leader
the
leader
of
the
war
that
he
should
only
assume
royal
authority
in
time
of
war
that
the
present
chiefs
should
retain
their
authority
and
each
govern
as
before
in
accordance
with
ancient
custom
he
proposed
to
be
king
only
during
he
would
if
they
liked
write
out
their
laws
for
them
in
a
book
and
so
give
their
customs
cohesion
and
shape
to
this
plan
the
tribes
readily
agreed
it
retained
all
the
former
customs
it
left
the
chiefs
their
simple
patriarchal
authority
and
it
gave
all
of
them
the
advantage
of
combination
in
war
as
the
leader
felix
was
henceforth
known
in
the
course
of
a
fortnight
upwards
of
six
thousand
men
had
joined
the
confederacy
and
felix
wrote
down
the
names
of
twenty
tribes
on
a
sheet
of
parchment
which
he
took
from
his
chest
a
hut
had
long
since
been
built
for
him
but
he
received
all
the
deputations
and
held
the
assemblies
which
were
necessary
in
the
circular
fort
he
was
so
pressed
to
visit
the
tribes
that
he
could
not
refuse
to
go
to
the
nearest
and
thus
his
journey
was
again
postponed
during
this
progress
from
tribal
camp
to
tribal
camp
felix
gained
the
adhesion
of
twelve
more
making
a
total
of
names
of
camps
representing
about
eight
thousand
spearmen
with
pride
felix
reflected
that
he
commanded
a
far
larger
army
than
the
prince
of
ponze
but
he
was
not
happy
months
had
now
elapsed
since
he
had
parted
from
aurora
there
were
no
means
of
communicating
with
her
a
letter
could
be
conveyed
only
by
a
special
messenger
he
could
not
get
a
messenger
and
even
if
one
had
been
forthcoming
he
could
not
instruct
him
how
to
reach
thyma
castle
he
did
not
know
himself
the
country
was
entirely
unexplored
except
that
the
direction
was
west
he
had
no
knowledge
whatever
he
had
often
inquired
of
the
shepherds
but
they
were
perfectly
ignorant
gate
was
the
most
westerly
of
all
their
settlements
which
chiefly
extended
eastwards
beyond
anker
gate
was
the
trackless
forest
of
which
none
but
the
bushmen
knew
anything
they
did
not
understand
what
he
meant
by
a
map
all
they
could
tell
him
was
that
the
range
of
mountainous
hills
continued
westerly
and
southerly
for
an
unascertained
distance
and
that
the
country
was
uninhabited
except
by
wandering
gipsy
tribes
south
was
the
sea
the
salt
water
but
they
never
went
down
to
it
or
near
it
because
there
was
no
sustenance
for
their
flocks
and
herds
till
now
felix
did
not
know
that
he
was
near
the
sea
he
resolved
at
once
to
visit
it
as
nearly
as
he
could
discover
the
great
fresh
water
lake
did
not
reach
any
farther
south
wolfstead
was
not
far
from
its
southern
margin
he
concluded
therefore
that
the
shore
of
the
lake
must
run
continually
westward
and
that
if
he
followed
it
he
should
ultimately
reach
the
very
creek
from
which
he
had
started
in
his
canoe
how
far
it
was
he
could
not
reckon
there
were
none
of
the
shepherds
who
could
be
sent
with
a
letter
they
were
not
hunters
and
were
unused
to
woodcraft
there
was
not
one
capable
of
the
journey
unless
he
went
himself
he
could
not
communicate
with
aurora
two
routes
were
open
to
him
one
straight
through
the
forest
on
foot
the
other
by
water
which
latter
entailed
the
construction
of
another
canoe
journey
by
water
too
he
had
found
was
subject
to
unforeseen
risks
till
he
could
train
some
of
the
younger
men
to
row
a
galley
he
decided
not
to
attempt
the
voyage
there
was
but
the
forest
route
left
and
that
he
resolved
to
attempt
but
when
and
how
without
offending
his
friends
meantime
while
he
revolved
the
subject
in
his
mind
he
visited
the
river
and
the
shore
of
the
great
lake
this
time
accompanied
by
ten
spears
the
second
visit
only
increased
his
admiration
of
the
place
and
his
desire
to
take
possession
of
it
he
ascended
a
tall
larch
from
whose
boughs
he
had
a
view
out
over
the
lake
the
shore
seemed
to
go
almost
directly
west
there
were
no
islands
and
no
land
in
sight
the
water
was
open
and
clear
next
day
he
started
for
the
sea
he
wished
to
see
it
for
its
own
sake
and
secondly
because
if
he
could
trace
the
trend
of
the
shore
he
would
perhaps
be
able
to
put
together
a
mental
map
of
the
country
and
so
assure
himself
of
the
right
route
to
pursue
when
he
started
for
thyma
castle
his
guides
took
him
directly
south
and
in
three
marches
three
days
brought
him
to
the
strand
this
journey
was
not
in
a
straight
line
they
considered
it
was
about
or
forty
miles
to
the
sea
but
the
country
was
covered
with
almost
impenetrable
forests
which
compelled
a
circuitous
path
they
had
also
to
avoid
a
great
ridge
of
hills
and
to
slip
through
a
pass
or
river
valley
because
these
hills
were
frequently
traversed
by
the
gipsies
who
were
said
indeed
to
travel
along
them
for
hundreds
of
miles
through
the
river
valley
therefore
which
wound
between
the
hills
they
approached
the
sea
so
much
on
a
level
with
it
that
felix
did
not
catch
a
distant
glimpse
in
the
afternoon
of
the
third
day
they
heard
a
low
murmur
and
soon
afterwards
came
out
from
the
forest
itself
upon
a
wide
bed
of
shingle
thinly
bordered
with
scattered
bushes
on
the
inland
side
climbing
over
this
felix
saw
the
green
line
of
the
sea
rise
and
extend
itself
on
either
hand
in
the
glory
of
the
scene
he
forgot
his
anxieties
and
his
hopes
they
fell
from
him
together
leaving
the
mind
alone
with
itself
and
love
for
the
memory
of
aurora
rendered
the
beauty
before
him
still
more
beautiful
love
like
the
sunshine
threw
a
glamour
over
the
waves
his
old
and
highest
thoughts
returned
to
him
in
all
their
strength
he
must
follow
them
he
could
not
help
himself
standing
where
the
foam
came
nearly
to
his
feet
the
resolution
to
pursue
his
aspirations
took
possession
of
him
as
strong
as
the
sea
when
he
turned
from
it
he
said
to
himself
this
is
the
first
step
homewards
to
her
this
is
the
first
step
of
my
renewed
labour
to
fulfil
his
love
and
his
ambition
was
one
and
the
same
thing
he
must
see
her
and
then
again
endeavour
with
all
his
abilities
to
make
himself
a
position
which
she
could
share
towards
the
evening
leaving
his
escort
he
partly
ascended
the
nearest
slope
of
the
hills
to
ascertain
more
perfectly
than
was
possible
at
a
lower
level
the
direction
in
which
the
shore
trended
it
was
nearly
east
and
west
and
as
the
shore
of
the
inland
lake
ran
west
it
appeared
that
between
them
there
was
a
broad
belt
of
forest
through
this
he
must
pass
and
he
thought
if
he
continued
due
west
he
should
cross
an
imaginary
line
drawn
south
from
his
own
home
through
thyma
castle
then
by
turning
to
the
north
he
should
presently
reach
that
settlement
but
when
he
should
cross
this
line
how
many
days
travelling
it
would
need
to
reach
it
was
a
matter
of
conjecture
and
he
must
be
guided
by
circumstances
the
appearance
of
the
country
and
his
hunter
instinct
on
the
way
back
to
wolfstead
felix
was
occupied
in
considering
how
he
could
leave
his
friends
and
yet
be
able
to
return
to
them
and
resume
his
position
his
general
idea
was
to
build
a
fortified
house
or
castle
at
the
spot
which
had
so
pleased
him
and
to
bring
aurora
to
it
he
could
then
devote
himself
to
increasing
and
consolidating
his
rule
over
these
people
and
perhaps
in
time
organize
a
kingdom
but
without
aurora
the
time
it
would
require
would
be
unendurable
by
some
means
he
must
bring
her
the
whole
day
long
as
he
walked
he
thought
and
thought
trying
to
discover
some
means
by
which
he
could
accomplish
these
things
yet
the
more
he
considered
the
more
difficult
they
appeared
to
him
there
seemed
no
plan
that
promised
success
all
he
could
do
would
be
to
risk
the
attempt
but
two
days
after
returning
from
the
sea
it
chanced
towards
the
afternoon
he
fell
asleep
and
on
awakening
found
his
mind
full
of
ideas
which
he
felt
sure
would
succeed
if
anything
would
the
question
had
solved
itself
during
sleep
the
mind
like
a
wearied
limb
strained
by
too
much
effort
had
recovered
its
elasticity
and
freshness
and
he
saw
clearly
what
he
ought
to
do
he
convened
an
assembly
of
the
chief
men
of
the
nearest
tribes
and
addressed
them
in
the
circular
fort
he
asked
them
if
they
could
place
sufficient
confidence
in
him
to
assist
him
in
carrying
out
certain
plans
although
he
should
not
be
able
to
altogether
disclose
the
object
he
had
in
view
they
replied
as
one
man
that
they
had
perfect
confidence
in
him
and
would
implicitly
obey
he
then
said
that
the
first
thing
he
wished
was
the
clearing
of
the
land
by
the
river
in
order
that
he
might
erect
a
fortified
dwelling
suitable
to
his
position
as
their
leader
in
war
next
he
desired
their
permission
to
leave
them
for
two
months
at
the
end
of
which
he
would
return
he
could
not
at
that
time
explain
the
reasons
but
until
his
journey
had
been
made
he
could
not
finally
settle
among
them
to
this
announcement
they
listened
in
profound
silence
it
was
evident
that
they
disliked
him
leaving
them
yet
did
not
wish
to
seem
distrustful
by
expressing
the
feeling
thirdly
he
continued
he
wanted
them
to
clear
a
path
through
the
forest
commencing
at
anker
gate
and
proceeding
exactly
west
the
track
to
be
thirty
yards
wide
in
order
that
the
undergrowth
might
not
encroach
upon
it
and
to
be
carried
on
straight
to
the
westward
until
his
return
the
distance
to
which
this
path
was
cleared
he
should
take
as
the
measure
of
their
loyalty
to
him
they
immediately
promised
to
fulfil
this
desire
but
added
that
there
was
no
necessity
to
wait
till
he
left
them
it
should
be
commenced
the
very
next
morning
to
his
reiterated
request
for
leave
of
absence
they
preserved
an
ominous
silence
and
as
he
had
no
more
to
say
the
assembly
then
broke
up
it
was
afternoon
and
felix
as
he
watched
the
departing
chiefs
reflected
that
these
men
would
certainly
set
a
watch
upon
him
to
prevent
his
escape
without
another
moment
delay
he
entered
his
hut
and
took
from
their
the
diamond
bracelet
the
turquoise
ring
and
other
presents
for
aurora
he
also
secured
some
provisions
and
put
two
spare
bowstrings
in
his
pocket
his
bow
of
course
he
carried
telling
the
people
about
that
he
was
going
to
the
next
settlement
bedeston
and
was
anxious
to
overtake
the
chief
from
that
place
who
had
attended
the
assembly
he
started
so
soon
as
he
knew
he
could
not
be
seen
from
the
settlement
he
quitted
the
trail
and
made
a
wide
circuit
till
he
faced
westwards
anker
gate
was
a
small
outlying
post
the
most
westerly
from
wolfstead
he
went
near
it
to
get
a
true
direction
but
not
sufficiently
near
to
be
observed
this
was
on
the
fourth
of
september
the
sun
was
declining
as
he
finally
left
the
country
of
his
friends
and
entered
the
immense
forest
which
lay
between
him
and
aurora
not
only
was
there
no
track
but
no
one
had
ever
traversed
it
unless
indeed
it
were
bushmen
who
to
all
intents
might
be
confused
with
the
wild
animals
which
it
contained
yet
his
heart
rose
as
he
walked
rapidly
among
the
oaks
already
he
saw
her
he
felt
the
welcoming
touch
of
her
hand
the
danger
of
bushman
or
gipsy
was
nothing
the
forest
at
the
commencement
consisted
chiefly
of
oaks
trees
which
do
not
grow
close
together
and
so
permitted
of
quick
walking
felix
pushed
on
absorbed
in
thought
the
sun
sank
still
onward
and
as
the
dusk
fell
he
was
still
moving
rapidly
westwards
the
end
