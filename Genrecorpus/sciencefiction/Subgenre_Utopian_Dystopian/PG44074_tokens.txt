introduction
a
few
words
about
ming
and
his
journal
as
this
book
is
little
more
than
a
transcript
of
a
document
originally
written
in
the
form
of
a
journal
by
a
man
who
until
about
a
year
ago
was
an
entire
stranger
to
me
and
as
the
document
itself
contains
not
a
few
statements
which
make
large
demands
upon
the
credulity
of
the
average
reader
it
seems
necessary
to
offer
some
explanation
regarding
both
the
journal
and
its
author
ming
or
to
give
him
his
full
name
ming
if
i
were
able
to
go
bail
for
ming
and
assure
the
british
public
that
he
was
an
entirely
credible
and
impartial
witness
the
book
might
have
stood
on
the
same
foundation
as
other
volumes
of
concerning
a
country
with
which
englishmen
are
still
insufficiently
acquainted
but
i
can
not
go
bail
for
ming
the
chief
source
of
my
knowledge
of
him
is
the
journal
itself
it
has
even
been
suggested
to
me
that
ming
did
not
write
the
journal
but
must
have
stolen
it
from
some
european
probably
an
englishman
on
this
point
i
shall
have
something
to
say
presently
perhaps
the
best
solution
of
these
difficulties
will
be
to
say
what
i
know
of
the
origin
of
the
book
ming
was
introduced
to
me
by
a
friend
whose
name
it
is
unnecessary
to
give
in
november
or
december
my
friend
said
he
remembered
meeting
him
in
london
as
far
back
as
since
then
however
ming
had
not
only
lived
in
london
and
travelled
throughout
england
but
had
also
spent
about
two
years
in
france
and
italy
and
had
visited
america
what
his
previous
career
had
been
i
do
not
know
nor
did
my
friend
know
he
appeared
always
to
have
plenty
of
money
and
we
surmised
that
he
might
have
been
attached
in
some
way
to
the
chinese
legation
but
he
never
gave
the
least
hint
about
any
such
connection
what
i
do
know
is
that
he
had
a
remarkable
knowledge
of
our
language
and
a
remarkable
familiarity
with
our
laws
customs
and
political
institutions
he
professed
a
great
admiration
for
our
british
constitutions
a
circumstance
which
may
account
for
some
of
the
political
views
to
which
he
gives
expression
in
his
journal
a
day
or
two
after
he
had
been
introduced
to
me
i
invited
him
to
dinner
and
on
this
occasion
we
found
much
to
talk
about
chiefly
european
politics
at
length
after
we
had
finished
a
bottle
of
wine
and
a
liqueur
or
two
he
remarked
that
of
all
the
countries
he
had
visited
in
western
europe
he
had
been
most
impressed
by
meccania
he
pronounced
the
word
my
knowledge
of
geography
is
not
complete
i
admit
but
i
thought
i
knew
all
the
countries
of
western
europe
the
war
has
helped
wonderfully
to
fill
up
certain
gaps
i
replied
that
i
had
never
heard
of
such
a
country
probably
not
he
answered
but
it
exists
and
the
proof
of
it
is
that
i
spent
some
five
months
there
in
and
kept
a
journal
of
my
experiences
you
mean
i
said
no
he
replied
i
hardly
knew
whether
he
were
experimenting
upon
my
sense
of
humour
or
had
got
confused
between
chinese
and
european
chronology
or
whether
the
liqueur
had
gone
to
his
head
possibly
and
here
i
became
a
little
nervous
he
was
a
little
anyhow
he
said
one
of
my
chief
objects
in
seeking
an
interview
with
you
was
to
consult
you
about
publishing
this
journal
we
were
dining
in
my
chambers
and
he
begged
permission
to
fetch
his
from
the
anteroom
he
returned
with
a
bulky
manuscript
i
wondered
if
he
were
hard
up
and
wanted
to
draw
me
into
some
sort
of
bargain
but
i
reflected
that
he
seemed
to
be
a
much
wealthier
man
than
i
he
said
he
was
convinced
that
his
journal
was
an
important
contribution
to
political
literature
and
would
be
found
of
interest
not
only
in
great
britain
but
in
france
and
america
as
well
it
would
be
a
good
thing
also
if
the
meccanians
themselves
could
read
it
unfortunately
there
was
no
chance
of
that
he
said
because
nothing
was
read
in
meccania
except
by
permission
of
the
government
he
went
on
to
explain
that
the
journal
had
been
kept
partly
in
english
partly
in
chinese
and
partly
in
meccanian
but
that
he
had
since
written
a
rough
translation
of
the
whole
in
english
his
knowledge
of
english
though
sufficient
for
most
practical
purposes
was
not
such
as
to
satisfy
the
literary
critics
and
that
was
one
of
the
reasons
why
he
sought
my
assistance
the
upshot
was
that
i
promised
to
read
the
manuscript
which
i
did
in
a
few
hours
next
day
i
found
that
it
purported
to
be
the
journal
of
a
visit
or
tour
made
in
to
a
country
he
called
meccania
i
had
little
difficulty
in
penetrating
the
fiction
it
was
obvious
what
country
was
meant
as
to
the
date
i
soon
came
to
the
conclusion
that
this
was
another
literary
device
to
enable
him
to
describe
with
greater
freedom
what
he
considered
to
be
the
probable
or
as
he
would
be
inclined
to
say
the
inevitable
development
of
the
tendencies
he
had
observed
in
that
country
whilst
some
parts
of
the
description
were
clear
and
even
vivid
many
things
were
left
in
obscurity
for
instance
the
extent
and
the
limits
of
the
country
were
quite
vague
only
two
cities
were
described
in
any
detail
little
was
said
about
domestic
life
little
about
religion
little
about
women
and
children
when
i
questioned
him
subsequently
on
these
points
he
said
that
the
obstacles
to
obtaining
full
information
had
proved
insuperable
he
had
not
been
at
liberty
to
travel
about
when
and
where
he
pleased
nor
to
get
into
close
contact
with
the
common
people
the
journal
itself
if
carefully
read
he
said
gave
a
sufficient
answer
on
these
points
and
he
had
preferred
to
give
a
faithful
account
of
what
had
actually
happened
to
him
and
of
the
conversations
he
had
had
with
representative
meccanians
leaving
the
evidence
to
speak
for
itself
if
he
had
said
little
about
education
the
little
that
he
had
said
would
be
found
most
illuminating
by
the
aid
of
insight
and
imagination
if
he
had
said
little
about
military
matters
that
was
because
it
would
have
been
positively
dangerous
to
be
suspected
of
spying
i
then
questioned
him
about
his
references
to
luniland
which
occur
on
the
very
first
page
of
the
journal
and
are
scattered
throughout
the
book
did
he
mean
to
indicate
england
by
this
term
if
so
it
was
not
exactly
flattering
ming
said
he
intended
no
offence
the
references
perhaps
a
little
obscure
the
simple
fact
was
that
some
years
ago
he
had
for
his
own
amusement
written
a
harmless
satire
upon
some
of
our
national
characteristics
he
had
then
hit
upon
the
phrase
luniland
and
lunilanders
and
he
could
not
get
it
out
of
his
head
it
was
just
an
instance
of
his
whimsicality
but
why
luniland
i
asked
why
not
he
said
you
do
such
funny
things
without
seeing
that
they
are
funny
such
as
what
i
asked
well
to
take
a
few
things
that
have
happened
recently
in
connection
with
your
great
war
you
are
intensely
proud
of
all
your
soldiers
and
rightly
yet
you
seem
to
pay
the
citizens
who
stay
at
home
about
three
times
as
much
as
the
soldiers
who
go
out
to
fight
and
i
have
been
told
although
this
seems
more
difficult
to
believe
that
you
pay
the
men
who
volunteered
from
the
very
first
less
than
those
whom
you
subsequently
had
to
compel
to
serve
in
your
armies
i
am
afraid
these
things
you
allege
are
true
i
replied
but
they
do
not
seem
funny
to
us
no
probably
not
he
said
each
nation
has
its
own
sense
of
humour
have
you
noticed
anything
else
of
the
same
kind
i
asked
oh
a
great
many
things
he
said
but
i
just
gave
you
a
sample
of
what
first
occurred
to
me
i
did
hear
of
some
men
being
excused
from
serving
in
the
army
because
they
were
engaged
in
carving
gravestones
for
the
soldiers
i
suppose
oh
no
he
replied
there
is
no
time
to
carve
gravestones
for
the
soldiers
for
people
who
die
in
their
beds
at
home
yet
you
do
not
profess
to
be
worshippers
of
the
dead
do
not
misunderstand
me
he
added
you
are
a
wonderful
people
and
it
is
perhaps
because
you
are
lunilanders
that
i
can
not
help
liking
you
we
are
lunilanders
ourselves
if
only
we
knew
it
if
you
were
to
come
to
my
country
you
would
find
many
things
just
as
funny
as
those
i
have
observed
here
perhaps
when
you
have
more
time
and
the
opportunity
is
favourable
you
may
like
to
read
my
book
of
observations
on
luniland
but
meccania
is
a
more
important
subject
after
a
careful
reading
of
ming
account
of
meccania
i
was
inclined
to
agree
with
him
indeed
i
would
go
so
far
as
to
say
that
the
dangers
to
be
apprehended
from
meccania
or
meccanianism
are
far
more
real
and
imminent
than
the
dangers
from
what
he
would
call
our
lunilandishness
and
for
that
reason
i
have
done
my
best
to
bring
before
the
british
public
his
account
of
meccania
although
i
hope
at
some
future
time
to
produce
perhaps
for
a
smaller
circle
of
readers
his
notes
on
luniland
and
the
lunilanders
lastly
a
word
about
the
suggestion
that
the
journal
can
not
be
the
work
of
a
chinaman
it
is
implied
that
the
sentiments
professed
by
ming
his
interests
and
his
way
of
looking
at
things
are
those
of
an
englishman
what
does
this
really
amount
to
ming
does
not
like
the
meccanians
certainly
should
not
like
the
meccanians
therefore
ming
is
an
englishman
ming
does
not
like
interferences
with
his
personal
habits
he
has
some
belief
in
the
political
value
of
individual
liberty
an
englishman
resents
interference
and
is
also
credited
with
a
passion
for
liberty
therefore
ming
must
be
an
englishman
now
i
would
suggest
that
so
far
from
sentiments
being
evidence
against
him
they
really
substantiate
his
character
as
a
chinaman
and
remove
all
suspicion
of
his
having
stolen
the
document
from
some
englishman
or
some
other
european
in
the
first
place
he
submits
calmly
to
indignities
that
a
typical
englishman
would
fiercely
resent
in
the
second
place
he
records
things
with
a
detachment
that
few
englishmen
would
be
capable
of
and
resigns
himself
to
the
customs
of
the
country
in
the
manner
of
a
mere
spectator
in
the
third
place
he
betrays
a
philosophical
interest
which
is
again
very
different
from
the
behaviour
of
most
of
our
countrymen
he
records
at
great
length
conversations
which
we
perhaps
find
tedious
because
he
thinks
the
ideas
of
the
meccanians
even
more
significant
than
their
customs
an
englishman
journal
in
the
same
circumstances
would
be
certain
to
contain
angry
diatribes
against
the
meccanians
whereas
ming
writes
with
singular
restraint
even
when
he
is
describing
features
of
meccanian
life
which
we
should
consider
revolting
possibly
the
style
in
which
the
book
is
presented
the
turns
of
expression
and
the
colloquialisms
give
the
journal
an
english
appearance
but
for
these
features
the
editor
is
responsible
as
it
was
ming
wish
that
the
book
should
not
suffer
from
the
most
common
defects
of
a
mere
translation
note
on
personal
names
the
names
which
occur
in
the
narrative
are
exactly
as
given
by
ming
in
his
journal
but
it
would
appear
that
he
has
taken
some
liberties
with
the
language
in
attempting
to
give
an
approximate
english
equivalent
for
the
original
meaning
the
translation
of
personal
names
and
is
notoriously
difficult
as
many
names
are
either
corrupt
or
obscure
meccania
the
chapter
i
i
become
a
foreign
observer
i
had
already
spent
several
years
in
various
parts
of
western
europe
staying
for
long
periods
in
francaria
romania
and
luniland
before
i
made
up
my
mind
to
pay
a
visit
to
meccania
before
coming
to
europe
i
had
read
a
great
deal
about
western
civilisation
generally
and
had
conceived
a
great
admiration
for
many
of
its
features
my
experiences
during
my
travels
had
on
the
whole
strengthened
my
feelings
of
admiration
although
even
an
oriental
may
be
allowed
to
criticise
some
of
the
characteristics
of
western
nations
in
romania
i
had
been
delighted
with
the
spectacle
of
history
displayed
in
every
part
of
the
country
the
whole
land
was
like
an
infinite
museum
but
it
was
not
in
romania
that
the
living
forces
of
the
present
were
to
be
found
in
francaria
on
the
other
hand
the
people
were
more
interesting
than
the
country
charming
as
that
country
was
in
many
ways
one
perceived
that
the
people
were
highly
civilised
they
displayed
a
combination
of
intellectual
and
moral
refinement
an
appreciation
of
the
material
and
sensuous
enjoyment
of
life
as
well
as
a
traditional
standard
of
conduct
and
manners
while
at
the
same
time
they
were
keenly
alive
to
the
most
modern
political
ideas
and
were
perpetually
discussing
new
phases
of
all
those
problems
which
must
constantly
emerge
wherever
political
liberty
is
held
as
an
article
of
popular
faith
but
it
was
in
luniland
that
i
felt
most
at
home
just
what
it
was
that
kept
me
constantly
pleased
and
interested
it
would
take
long
to
tell
and
i
must
reserve
my
observations
on
luniland
for
another
occasion
it
will
be
sufficient
to
say
here
that
i
was
not
so
much
impressed
with
the
wealth
of
ideas
current
in
society
in
luniland
francaria
was
more
prolific
in
ideas
and
in
francaria
intellectual
discussion
was
more
brilliant
as
with
the
stability
of
certain
political
principles
which
as
it
seems
to
me
at
any
rate
are
destined
to
prevail
ultimately
throughout
the
world
for
many
reasons
i
thoroughly
enjoyed
the
three
or
four
years
which
with
short
intervals
of
absence
i
had
spent
there
i
had
made
many
acquaintances
and
even
a
considerable
number
of
friends
in
fact
i
had
stayed
so
long
contrary
to
my
original
intention
that
there
was
little
time
left
for
carrying
out
the
project
of
visiting
meccania
and
i
was
in
some
doubt
whether
i
should
not
have
to
return
home
without
seeing
that
remarkable
country
for
i
had
already
received
one
or
two
pressing
reminders
from
my
family
that
they
were
expecting
my
return
before
leaving
home
however
i
had
promised
some
of
my
political
friends
who
were
interested
in
the
subject
of
meccanian
culture
that
i
would
not
return
without
investigating
the
social
and
political
life
of
meccania
they
had
in
fact
written
several
times
to
remind
me
of
my
promise
and
i
had
put
them
off
by
explaining
that
whilst
travelling
in
the
rest
of
europe
was
a
simple
and
easy
matter
i
could
not
enter
meccania
without
elaborate
preparation
when
i
began
to
talk
to
some
of
my
friends
in
luniland
of
my
idea
of
investigating
meccanian
culture
on
the
spot
i
received
the
most
conflicting
advice
some
said
do
go
on
any
account
you
will
be
arrested
as
a
spy
and
probably
shot
others
said
meccania
was
ahead
of
luniland
in
every
respect
and
that
i
should
certainly
see
something
worth
remembering
if
i
went
there
others
again
said
that
if
i
did
go
i
should
be
looked
upon
with
suspicion
on
my
return
in
fact
i
gathered
that
most
of
my
friends
would
never
open
their
doors
to
me
again
finally
i
took
counsel
with
yorke
a
gentleman
occupying
an
important
position
in
lunopolis
a
man
of
wide
culture
and
sober
views
whom
it
was
a
great
privilege
to
count
among
my
friends
he
discussed
the
matter
very
frankly
with
me
i
remember
it
was
a
cold
evening
early
in
march
and
we
sat
by
the
fire
in
his
study
after
an
excellent
dinner
we
lunilanders
he
said
do
not
like
the
meccanians
and
few
of
us
ever
visit
meccania
we
prefer
to
have
nothing
to
do
with
that
country
and
if
you
followed
the
advice
which
nine
out
of
ten
of
my
countrymen
would
give
you
you
would
not
go
near
meccania
but
you
have
come
to
europe
partly
at
all
events
to
study
our
civilisation
and
not
simply
to
amuse
yourself
and
although
there
is
little
intercourse
between
the
meccanians
and
the
rest
of
us
if
you
want
to
know
europe
you
can
not
afford
to
neglect
meccania
if
i
may
advise
you
i
should
say
go
there
by
all
means
see
as
much
as
you
can
with
your
own
eyes
but
try
to
see
the
country
as
a
whole
do
be
content
to
see
just
what
interests
you
or
amuses
you
or
what
excites
your
admiration
if
you
do
that
you
will
be
like
certain
cranks
from
this
country
who
come
back
and
tell
us
there
is
no
poverty
in
meccania
there
are
no
strikes
there
is
no
disorder
no
ignorance
no
preventible
disease
you
at
any
rate
are
not
a
simpleton
to
be
taken
in
by
any
sort
of
but
the
meccanians
are
very
clever
and
they
manage
to
impose
on
many
people
who
are
not
so
wideawake
as
you
are
how
much
you
will
be
allowed
to
see
i
do
know
it
is
a
good
many
years
since
i
was
there
but
if
things
are
managed
as
i
am
told
they
are
now
you
will
not
see
all
you
want
by
any
means
in
fact
in
one
sense
you
would
learn
far
more
from
books
you
read
meccanian
easily
already
i
know
than
from
an
actual
visit
but
unless
you
go
there
you
will
not
feel
satisfied
that
what
you
read
is
true
and
you
will
not
have
the
same
sense
of
reality
the
great
thing
is
to
look
at
the
country
as
a
whole
i
do
mean
geographically
but
spiritually
there
is
always
a
tendency
for
foolish
people
to
take
this
idea
from
one
country
and
that
institution
from
another
enthusiastic
reformers
are
ready
to
shut
their
eyes
to
everything
else
if
only
they
can
get
support
for
their
particular
fads
if
you
find
after
a
real
study
of
meccanian
life
that
you
would
like
to
turn
your
own
country
into
a
second
edition
of
meccania
i
shall
say
like
old
dogberry
that
you
are
not
the
man
i
took
you
for
he
impressed
upon
me
the
importance
of
a
thorough
knowledge
of
the
language
but
i
was
able
to
satisfy
him
on
that
score
for
i
had
learnt
to
read
easily
before
coming
to
europe
and
had
already
undertaken
a
long
course
of
colloquial
meccanian
under
a
good
teacher
during
a
visit
to
francaria
besides
i
rather
prided
myself
on
my
aptitude
for
languages
and
considered
myself
well
equipped
so
i
packed
up
all
the
miscellaneous
goods
i
had
collected
and
stored
them
in
lunopolis
reserving
only
a
couple
of
trunks
filled
with
the
usual
necessaries
for
a
mere
tourist
i
had
my
passport
from
our
own
government
i
procured
another
from
the
luniland
foreign
office
i
obtained
further
the
necessary
permission
from
the
meccanian
government
and
choosing
the
shortest
route
arrived
at
the
outer
frontier
on
march
as
most
people
know
meccania
has
a
double
frontier
on
the
western
side
a
belt
of
country
twenty
miles
wide
is
preserved
as
neutral
territory
a
veritable
no
man
land
this
is
a
relic
from
the
great
war
it
is
entirely
uninhabited
and
uncultivated
not
a
single
line
of
railway
crosses
it
and
only
five
roads
which
are
merely
rough
tracks
lead
across
it
from
various
points
to
the
five
frontier
towns
on
the
inner
side
these
are
the
only
gates
into
meccania
on
the
west
the
small
town
on
the
outer
frontier
in
francaria
through
which
i
was
to
pass
is
called
graves
here
my
first
delay
occurred
intercourse
with
meccania
is
so
limited
that
although
the
official
conveyance
goes
only
once
a
week
i
found
no
more
than
a
dozen
persons
collected
there
in
readiness
for
the
journey
across
no
man
land
i
was
about
to
take
my
place
in
the
conveyance
provided
to
carry
us
to
bridgetown
on
the
inner
frontier
when
it
was
discovered
that
i
had
no
ticket
authorising
me
to
make
this
journey
i
produced
my
passports
and
the
letter
giving
me
permission
to
travel
in
meccania
but
the
official
who
took
charge
of
foreigners
pointed
to
a
printed
instruction
on
the
back
of
the
letter
informing
me
that
a
ticket
would
be
forwarded
by
a
later
post
no
explanations
or
expostulations
were
of
any
use
until
i
had
that
ticket
i
could
not
enter
meccania
the
conveyance
went
only
once
a
week
there
was
nothing
for
it
therefore
but
to
stay
at
some
hotel
in
graves
or
return
to
lunopolis
in
search
of
my
missing
ticket
i
put
up
at
a
small
hotel
in
graves
and
telegraphed
to
my
last
address
for
my
letters
these
arrived
two
days
later
and
among
them
was
my
precious
ticket
the
week
i
spent
in
graves
forms
no
part
of
my
meccanian
tour
so
i
will
say
nothing
about
it
except
that
it
gave
me
an
opportunity
of
seeing
the
extraordinary
sight
of
no
man
land
it
stretched
like
a
belt
of
desert
as
far
as
one
could
see
rough
grass
grew
here
and
there
but
no
other
vegetation
every
year
in
the
warm
weather
the
grass
was
fired
and
other
means
were
taken
also
to
ensure
that
the
weeds
should
not
injure
the
vegetation
on
the
cultivated
side
which
by
contrast
looked
like
a
garden
at
intervals
of
every
twenty
yards
or
so
an
iron
pole
was
erected
with
wire
between
otherwise
there
was
no
obstacle
but
no
unauthorised
person
so
i
was
told
ever
crossed
the
line
at
the
end
of
the
week
a
few
more
travellers
arrived
and
were
met
by
the
conveyance
from
bridgetown
it
was
something
like
a
large
prison
van
but
quite
comfortable
inside
except
for
the
fact
that
the
passengers
could
not
see
outside
my
were
evidently
strangers
to
one
another
one
or
two
i
thought
were
meccanians
returning
home
but
as
there
was
little
conversation
and
the
journey
lasted
not
more
than
an
hour
i
was
able
to
learn
nothing
about
any
of
them
when
the
car
stopped
it
was
a
sort
of
large
the
door
was
opened
by
a
porter
in
a
dark
blue
uniform
and
i
found
myself
in
the
large
courtyard
of
the
bridgetown
police
office
what
became
of
my
i
have
no
idea
but
i
was
conducted
to
a
where
another
subordinate
official
in
a
grey
uniform
took
my
papers
and
about
ten
minutes
after
led
me
into
a
small
office
adjoining
where
a
man
in
a
green
uniform
sat
at
a
desk
surrounded
by
neat
little
bundles
of
papers
of
various
colours
he
was
a
rather
stout
man
of
middle
age
with
bushy
hair
and
whiskers
yet
rather
bald
in
front
with
his
light
grey
eyes
slightly
protruding
he
looked
at
me
for
a
few
seconds
and
said
mr
ming
i
said
i
am
mr
ming
i
am
inspector
of
foreigners
stiff
he
said
very
distinctly
and
whilst
you
are
in
bridgetown
you
will
be
responsible
to
me
for
your
good
conduct
by
what
title
are
you
authorised
to
be
addressed
i
am
plain
ming
or
citizen
ming
i
replied
but
you
have
some
other
title
doubtless
he
said
what
office
do
you
hold
in
your
own
country
well
i
replied
i
am
what
we
call
a
national
councillor
i
am
also
the
president
of
the
literary
society
of
my
own
province
and
i
have
been
once
the
mayor
of
my
native
town
then
you
had
better
be
addressed
as
national
councillor
ming
or
as
literary
president
ming
or
mayor
ming
he
answered
promptly
choose
which
you
prefer
and
write
down
the
title
on
the
third
line
of
this
form
i
wrote
down
with
a
smile
national
councillor
ming
national
councillor
ming
he
said
as
i
handed
the
form
back
to
him
before
we
have
any
further
conversation
you
will
please
pass
into
the
next
room
and
undergo
your
medical
examination
i
passed
into
the
next
room
where
i
found
a
man
also
in
a
green
uniform
but
with
different
facings
from
those
worn
by
inspector
of
foreigners
stiff
national
councillor
ming
he
said
allow
me
to
make
my
necessary
medical
examination
i
wondered
how
he
had
got
my
name
so
pat
then
i
remembered
that
immediately
before
passing
me
into
the
next
room
inspector
stiff
had
put
a
card
into
a
pneumatic
tube
by
the
side
of
his
desk
the
doctor
led
me
out
of
his
office
into
a
small
bedroom
next
to
which
stood
a
bathroom
fitted
with
various
apparatus
after
undressing
in
the
bedroom
i
was
ordered
to
step
into
the
bathroom
where
first
of
all
i
was
carefully
measured
in
at
least
a
score
of
places
head
ears
arms
hands
legs
feet
chest
etc
etc
and
were
taken
i
was
weighed
my
chest
was
sounded
my
organs
were
investigated
with
various
curious
instruments
a
record
of
my
speaking
voice
was
taken
for
which
purpose
i
had
to
pronounce
several
long
sentences
in
meccanian
and
in
my
own
language
a
lock
of
my
hair
was
cut
off
and
finally
i
was
photographed
in
several
different
positions
i
was
then
ordered
to
bathe
at
first
in
water
afterwards
in
a
fluid
which
was
evidently
some
sort
of
disinfectant
at
the
end
of
about
an
hour
and
a
half
the
doctor
pronounced
me
to
be
and
asked
me
to
dress
myself
in
some
garments
specially
used
on
these
occasions
the
garments
were
made
either
of
paper
or
of
some
substance
like
paper
and
were
intended
to
be
destroyed
after
use
i
was
now
in
the
bedroom
the
doctor
had
disappeared
but
a
sort
of
orderly
in
a
grey
uniform
knocked
at
the
door
and
brought
in
a
tray
with
some
food
and
coffee
he
announced
that
inspector
of
foreigners
stiff
would
be
ready
to
see
me
again
in
fifteen
minutes
i
was
very
glad
of
the
food
the
first
i
had
eaten
since
my
arrival
and
at
the
end
of
the
fifteen
minutes
i
was
again
led
into
mr
stiff
room
still
wearing
my
paper
suit
now
said
he
you
will
remain
in
your
room
until
morning
when
your
own
clothes
will
be
restored
to
you
after
having
been
thoroughly
disinfected
you
can
have
supper
supplied
to
you
in
your
room
and
as
you
will
have
a
few
hours
to
spare
i
should
advise
you
to
make
yourself
acquainted
with
the
contents
of
these
documents
you
will
find
they
contain
all
the
instructions
you
require
for
the
first
few
days
i
retired
to
my
room
feeling
rather
fatigued
by
the
various
experiences
i
had
already
gone
through
but
for
want
of
something
more
interesting
i
began
to
study
my
the
first
document
was
a
closely
printed
circular
of
eight
foolscap
pages
containing
numerous
extracts
from
the
law
relating
to
the
conduct
of
foreign
observers
by
the
time
i
had
waded
through
this
i
thought
i
had
done
enough
for
one
day
and
as
the
orderly
came
in
with
preparations
for
some
supper
i
asked
him
if
i
might
see
the
daily
paper
he
did
not
seem
to
understand
what
i
meant
after
some
further
explanation
he
said
we
have
no
daily
paper
in
bridgetown
we
have
only
the
weekly
local
gazette
but
you
have
some
kind
of
newspaper
which
circulates
in
bridgetown
i
said
perhaps
it
is
published
in
some
other
large
town
perhaps
in
mecco
i
suggested
mecco
is
the
capital
of
meccania
we
have
no
general
newspaper
published
daily
he
replied
i
thought
he
had
misunderstood
me
so
i
begged
him
to
bring
me
the
local
gazette
he
said
he
would
try
to
get
me
a
copy
presently
while
i
was
eating
my
supper
another
official
dressed
in
a
bright
uniform
with
green
facings
made
his
appearance
he
explained
that
inspector
stiff
had
gone
home
it
was
then
about
seven
or
later
and
that
he
was
left
in
charge
of
the
office
i
had
asked
for
a
newspaper
for
what
purpose
did
i
require
a
newspaper
oh
i
said
just
to
see
the
current
news
news
what
about
he
asked
about
anything
i
replied
one
likes
to
see
the
newspaper
to
see
what
is
going
on
but
no
one
wants
anything
except
for
some
purpose
he
replied
and
you
have
not
explained
the
purpose
for
which
you
require
a
newspaper
also
there
are
no
general
newspapers
there
are
the
various
gazettes
issued
by
the
different
departments
of
government
and
there
are
a
few
local
gazettes
dealing
with
purely
municipal
matters
but
until
you
have
entered
upon
your
authorised
tour
of
observation
i
should
have
no
authority
to
supply
you
with
any
of
these
what
a
fuss
about
such
a
trifle
i
thought
and
wished
i
had
never
troubled
him
i
apologised
for
making
the
request
whereupon
he
said
if
you
wish
for
something
to
read
after
supper
there
is
a
case
of
books
in
the
office
from
which
no
doubt
i
can
supply
your
needs
i
thanked
him
and
presently
went
to
see
the
books
there
was
a
work
on
the
in
relation
to
foreign
in
three
volumes
a
of
the
development
of
town
in
five
volumes
a
treatise
on
in
two
volumes
a
series
of
reports
on
the
various
municipal
departments
of
bridgetown
an
of
and
a
few
other
works
equally
interesting
i
took
away
a
volume
hardly
noticing
what
it
was
intending
to
use
it
only
as
a
means
of
inducing
sleep
which
it
did
most
effectively
i
was
awakened
about
six
next
morning
by
the
orderly
in
the
grey
uniform
entering
the
bedroom
to
announce
that
my
bath
would
be
ready
in
five
minutes
and
that
it
was
against
the
rules
to
be
late
i
promptly
went
into
the
bathroom
and
found
the
bath
half
filled
with
a
thin
fluid
which
smelt
like
a
strong
disinfectant
the
orderly
explained
that
all
foreigners
were
obliged
to
be
disinfected
in
this
way
but
i
said
i
was
disinfected
only
yesterday
the
bath
yesterday
he
explained
was
to
ensure
that
you
brought
no
disease
into
the
country
and
what
is
this
for
i
asked
this
is
to
prevent
you
from
contracting
any
new
disease
through
the
change
in
climate
he
answered
i
remarked
that
the
authorities
were
very
solicitous
of
the
welfare
of
foreigners
to
which
he
replied
ah
we
must
look
after
ourselves
a
sick
man
is
a
source
of
infection
i
was
told
to
remain
in
the
bath
minutes
i
found
i
had
no
choice
for
once
in
i
had
no
power
to
get
out
at
the
end
of
the
minutes
the
orderly
came
and
lifted
me
out
turned
on
a
shower
bath
and
said
breakfast
in
ten
minutes
my
own
clothes
had
been
returned
to
me
i
dressed
quickly
ate
my
breakfast
which
was
the
usual
light
continental
early
breakfast
of
rolls
and
coffee
and
was
preparing
to
leave
the
police
office
when
the
orderly
informed
me
that
inspector
of
foreigners
stiff
was
ready
to
see
me
national
councillor
ming
he
began
as
soon
as
i
entered
his
room
i
find
you
have
with
you
letters
of
introduction
to
several
persons
in
meccania
so
my
private
papers
had
been
closely
scrutinised
during
the
process
of
disinfection
you
will
of
course
not
present
these
until
you
have
received
permission
from
the
proper
authority
in
no
case
can
this
be
given
until
a
period
of
three
months
has
elapsed
now
after
completing
these
forms
in
accordance
with
the
instructions
i
handed
you
yesterday
you
will
be
authorised
to
begin
your
tour
of
observation
in
bridgetown
here
he
handed
me
four
forms
you
must
first
decide
whether
you
mean
to
stay
a
week
or
a
month
or
longer
for
that
will
naturally
determine
the
programme
of
your
tour
of
observation
you
can
not
in
any
case
leave
without
giving
three
clear
days
notice
and
completing
your
arrangements
as
to
the
place
you
are
proceeding
to
oh
i
said
in
some
surprise
i
had
no
idea
that
would
be
necessary
i
thought
i
would
just
look
round
perhaps
for
a
day
or
two
then
go
on
to
one
of
your
other
important
cities
and
make
my
way
by
degrees
to
mecco
then
you
can
not
have
read
the
instruction
form
no
or
you
would
know
that
is
quite
impossible
if
you
intend
to
stay
a
month
please
fill
up
this
blue
form
i
think
perhaps
it
would
be
better
to
say
a
week
i
replied
then
if
i
want
to
stay
longer
i
suppose
i
could
do
so
if
you
had
read
the
instructions
you
would
have
seen
that
the
plan
of
a
tour
of
a
week
is
on
quite
a
different
scale
from
that
of
a
tour
of
a
fortnight
or
a
month
you
must
decide
now
which
you
will
take
i
stuck
to
the
week
and
we
filled
up
the
necessary
forms
for
tour
no
your
conductor
will
be
of
foreign
observers
sheep
he
said
next
my
conductor
i
exclaimed
is
it
necessary
to
have
a
conductor
you
are
not
still
in
luniland
he
replied
testily
and
i
must
again
remind
you
that
if
you
had
read
the
extracts
from
the
law
with
reference
to
foreign
observers
you
would
not
have
asked
the
question
sheep
will
be
here
in
five
minutes
he
said
evidently
anxious
to
get
rid
of
me
and
as
soon
as
you
have
discharged
this
bill
of
expenses
he
will
take
you
to
the
hotel
for
foreign
observers
and
you
will
begin
your
tour
here
he
handed
me
a
sort
of
invoice
containing
the
following
items
to
food
to
bed
one
night
to
medical
examination
to
temporary
garments
to
service
total
there
was
certainly
nothing
exorbitant
about
the
charges
all
the
same
i
grudged
the
for
the
medical
examination
chapter
ii
bridgetown
tour
no
of
foreign
observers
sheep
came
in
as
i
was
paying
the
bill
he
was
a
man
about
fifty
and
had
the
appearance
of
an
old
he
looked
quiet
and
rather
stolid
i
never
saw
him
smile
during
the
whole
week
i
was
with
him
but
he
was
not
offensive
in
his
manner
like
inspector
stiff
he
wore
a
green
uniform
but
one
with
fewer
facings
and
with
buttons
before
we
started
to
walk
across
to
the
hotel
he
asked
if
i
had
got
my
i
fished
out
a
small
notebook
such
as
i
had
used
in
luniland
for
marking
engagements
that
is
of
no
use
for
the
purpose
he
informed
me
you
must
have
one
like
this
and
he
showed
me
a
book
about
six
inches
by
four
inches
with
four
pages
for
each
day
oh
i
said
i
shall
never
need
all
that
besides
it
is
spaced
for
a
month
only
in
a
perfectly
voice
he
said
calmly
every
person
in
meccania
uses
a
like
this
you
will
find
it
indispensable
in
order
that
you
may
make
your
entries
correctly
in
your
weekly
diary
for
the
time
department
the
what
department
i
asked
rather
puzzled
the
time
department
but
never
mind
i
will
explain
all
that
in
its
proper
place
we
will
get
a
as
we
go
along
we
walked
to
the
hotel
and
on
the
way
sheep
slipped
into
an
office
of
some
kind
and
handed
me
a
of
the
regulation
type
as
we
entered
the
hotel
which
was
a
very
small
affair
evidently
the
number
of
foreigners
in
bridgetown
at
any
one
time
could
not
be
more
than
a
dozen
if
they
were
all
lodged
here
he
popped
his
head
into
a
sort
of
near
the
door
and
said
in
a
loud
voice
nine
national
councillor
ming
a
girl
in
the
echoed
the
words
whilst
making
an
entry
on
a
large
sheet
and
handed
him
a
sheet
of
cardboard
divided
or
ruled
into
small
squares
this
he
presented
to
me
telling
me
to
note
down
on
it
the
exact
time
when
i
entered
and
left
the
hotel
and
to
get
it
initialed
every
other
day
by
the
girl
clerk
in
the
if
the
times
did
not
tally
with
her
record
i
was
to
consult
the
manager
of
the
hotel
the
first
thing
to
do
is
to
report
yourself
to
the
manager
of
the
hotel
said
sheep
when
he
had
taken
me
to
my
room
where
i
found
my
baggage
which
i
had
not
seen
since
i
left
graves
the
manager
was
a
rather
fussy
little
man
also
in
a
green
uniform
like
sheep
but
with
different
facings
he
did
not
seem
specially
pleased
to
see
me
all
he
said
was
i
hope
you
will
not
give
so
much
trouble
as
the
last
of
your
we
had
here
if
you
will
study
the
regulations
you
will
save
yourself
and
me
much
inconvenience
meals
are
at
eight
one
and
six
and
at
no
other
times
and
remember
that
conversation
with
other
foreign
observers
is
prohibited
until
you
have
received
the
certificate
of
approval
conductor
sheep
had
rung
up
for
a
and
as
we
waited
a
few
minutes
for
its
arrival
he
said
as
you
will
have
seen
from
the
printed
programme
of
tour
no
we
shall
first
make
a
geographical
survey
of
the
town
then
we
shall
visit
the
public
buildings
taking
note
of
their
architectural
features
and
beginning
first
with
those
under
local
control
following
on
with
those
under
the
joint
control
of
the
central
and
local
government
and
concluding
with
those
solely
under
the
control
of
the
central
government
and
of
the
first
category
we
shall
see
those
first
which
have
to
do
with
the
bodily
needs
and
of
these
we
shall
take
first
those
connected
with
food
then
with
clothing
then
with
housing
for
that
is
the
only
logical
order
everything
has
been
carefully
prescribed
by
the
department
of
culture
and
the
department
of
sociology
and
the
same
plan
is
followed
by
all
foreign
observers
whatever
city
they
may
be
visiting
we
went
first
to
a
tower
which
stood
on
a
hill
about
a
mile
outside
the
town
here
we
had
a
view
of
the
surrounding
country
the
town
lay
in
a
bend
of
the
river
it
was
not
exactly
picturesque
but
the
large
number
of
new
public
buildings
near
the
centre
the
broad
streets
lined
with
villas
each
surrounded
by
a
garden
in
the
large
residential
quarter
on
the
western
side
and
even
the
orderly
streets
of
houses
and
flats
on
the
more
thickly
populated
eastern
side
produced
altogether
a
fine
effect
the
country
round
was
magnificent
low
wooded
hills
rose
on
three
sides
backed
by
higher
hills
in
the
distance
sheep
talked
almost
learnedly
about
the
geology
of
the
district
and
the
historical
reasons
for
the
situation
of
bridgetown
then
he
pointed
out
that
the
plan
of
the
town
was
like
a
wheel
in
the
centre
were
the
public
buildings
and
squares
the
main
streets
radiated
like
spokes
and
between
these
came
the
residential
quarters
of
the
seven
social
classes
those
of
the
first
three
on
the
west
side
those
of
the
fourth
to
the
north
and
south
those
of
the
fifth
sixth
and
seventh
to
the
east
on
the
east
side
also
lay
the
factories
workshops
and
warehouses
the
shops
were
arranged
in
a
sort
of
ring
running
through
the
middle
of
each
of
the
residential
quarters
the
seven
social
classes
i
asked
i
had
heard
in
a
vague
way
of
the
existence
of
this
arrangement
but
had
little
idea
what
it
meant
yes
answered
sheep
as
if
he
were
reading
from
a
the
first
consists
of
the
highest
aristocracy
military
and
civil
the
second
of
the
military
and
naval
officers
all
of
noble
birth
the
third
of
the
highest
mercantile
class
with
an
income
of
a
year
and
the
officials
of
the
first
grade
in
the
imperial
civil
service
the
fourth
of
the
officials
of
the
civil
service
of
lower
grades
and
the
bulk
of
the
professional
classes
the
fifth
of
the
skilled
artisan
class
the
sixth
of
the
and
the
seventh
of
the
menial
industrial
groups
i
asked
him
to
go
over
it
again
whilst
i
took
a
note
for
future
reference
the
rest
of
the
morning
passed
in
listening
to
sheep
elaborate
descriptions
of
the
drainage
and
sewage
systems
the
water
supply
the
power
and
light
and
heat
supply
the
tramway
system
the
parcels
system
the
postal
delivery
system
the
milk
delivery
system
all
from
the
geographical
point
of
view
after
lunch
we
spent
some
time
in
going
all
over
the
town
on
the
tramways
this
completed
the
geographical
survey
at
six
i
was
deposited
in
the
hotel
just
in
time
for
dinner
presently
i
prepared
to
go
out
to
some
place
of
amusement
but
on
attempting
to
leave
the
hotel
i
was
stopped
by
the
porter
who
told
me
i
could
not
leave
the
hotel
unless
accompanied
by
my
conductor
so
i
spent
the
evening
in
writing
up
my
journal
during
the
day
i
had
noticed
that
everywhere
all
the
men
were
dressed
in
a
sort
of
uniform
and
that
the
colours
of
these
uniforms
corresponded
to
the
rank
or
class
of
the
wearers
perhaps
i
ought
to
have
mentioned
this
circumstance
earlier
for
certainly
it
was
one
of
the
first
things
i
noticed
when
i
began
to
go
into
the
streets
the
colours
of
the
uniforms
are
very
striking
and
even
crude
they
supply
the
only
touch
of
the
picturesque
in
bridgetown
for
judging
by
my
first
day
impressions
of
the
town
i
should
imagine
that
the
authorities
responsible
for
rebuilding
it
have
swept
away
every
vestige
of
the
tiny
mediæval
city
which
once
existed
on
this
spot
and
have
replaced
it
by
a
perfectly
uniform
piece
of
meccanian
in
such
a
setting
these
uniforms
strike
one
at
first
as
out
of
place
but
perhaps
i
have
not
yet
grasped
their
purpose
or
significance
the
colour
of
the
uniforms
of
the
members
of
the
first
class
is
white
that
of
the
second
class
red
or
scarlet
of
the
third
yellow
of
the
fourth
green
of
the
fifth
chocolate
of
the
sixth
grey
of
the
seventh
dark
blue
but
so
far
i
have
seen
no
white
uniforms
and
only
a
few
scarlet
i
saw
several
yellow
uniforms
but
the
most
common
were
the
green
uniforms
of
the
fourth
class
and
the
chocolate
uniforms
of
the
fifth
class
to
which
the
skilled
artisans
belong
greys
and
dark
blues
were
also
fairly
numerous
but
what
surprised
me
most
of
all
was
the
small
number
of
people
to
be
seen
in
the
streets
i
must
ask
sheep
for
the
explanation
of
this
promptly
at
nine
next
morning
of
foreign
observers
sheep
made
his
appearance
at
the
hotel
and
we
began
our
tour
of
the
public
buildings
he
took
me
first
to
the
which
stood
alongside
the
railway
on
the
outskirts
of
the
town
near
the
industrial
quarter
it
was
a
great
warehouse
through
which
all
the
food
brought
into
the
town
has
to
pass
before
it
is
allowed
to
be
sold
in
the
markets
and
shops
the
sole
exception
is
milk
which
is
distributed
by
municipal
servants
the
building
was
very
extensive
and
several
stories
high
the
two
ends
were
open
for
the
passage
of
railway
wagons
the
architecture
was
not
without
a
certain
coarse
dignity
the
arches
were
decorated
in
romanesque
style
and
the
whole
front
facing
the
street
was
covered
with
rude
sculptures
in
high
relief
of
scenes
connected
with
the
production
of
food
the
interior
walls
were
covered
with
frescoes
depicting
similar
scenes
conductor
sheep
grew
almost
enthusiastic
over
this
exhibition
of
meccanian
art
all
these
decorations
he
said
had
been
executed
by
the
students
of
the
bridgetown
art
school
i
was
not
altogether
surprised
to
hear
this
there
was
something
so
very
naïve
and
obvious
about
the
whole
idea
we
next
saw
the
municipal
which
were
almost
adjoining
inspector
sheep
informed
me
how
many
minutes
it
took
to
kill
and
prepare
for
the
meat
market
a
given
number
of
cattle
sheep
or
pigs
he
dilated
on
the
perfection
of
the
machinery
for
every
process
and
assured
me
that
not
a
single
drop
of
blood
was
wasted
the
amount
of
every
particular
kind
of
animal
food
required
for
each
week
in
the
year
was
ascertained
by
the
sociological
department
and
consequently
there
was
no
difficulty
in
regulating
the
supply
the
perfection
of
the
methods
of
preserving
meat
also
effected
some
economy
conductor
sheep
assured
me
that
the
meccanian
had
become
the
models
for
all
the
civilised
world
and
that
a
former
director
of
the
bridgetown
had
been
lent
to
a
foreign
government
to
organise
the
system
of
technical
instruction
for
butchers
the
five
markets
were
in
five
different
parts
of
the
city
they
served
to
distribute
perishable
foods
only
which
were
not
allowed
to
be
sold
in
the
ordinary
shops
all
women
in
the
fifth
sixth
and
seventh
classes
were
obliged
to
do
their
marketing
in
person
each
person
was
obliged
to
deal
solely
with
one
dealer
for
a
year
at
a
time
and
to
attend
at
the
market
at
a
particular
hour
so
that
there
should
be
no
congestion
and
no
waste
of
time
on
the
part
of
the
dealers
this
i
suppose
explains
the
wonderful
orderliness
of
these
markets
there
was
no
gossiping
or
chaffering
whether
the
people
enjoy
this
arrangement
is
a
matter
upon
which
sheep
did
not
enlighten
me
he
said
it
had
been
calculated
by
the
time
department
that
an
economy
of
per
cent
had
been
effected
in
the
time
spent
upon
the
daily
purchase
of
food
since
the
introduction
of
the
modern
market
system
foods
that
are
not
perishable
are
sold
in
the
shops
and
as
regards
certain
articles
there
is
the
same
system
of
choosing
each
year
the
shop
at
which
one
buys
a
particular
article
whilst
as
regards
others
trade
is
free
the
housewife
must
buy
her
bread
always
from
the
same
baker
but
things
like
mustard
spices
coffee
or
preserved
food
may
be
bought
at
any
shop
the
sale
of
drink
is
regulated
in
a
different
way
the
three
lowest
classes
are
not
allowed
to
keep
drink
in
their
houses
but
as
the
favourite
national
drink
is
a
mild
kind
of
beer
which
can
be
got
in
any
restaurant
there
is
no
apparent
hardship
in
this
regulation
the
way
in
which
excess
is
checked
is
very
curious
the
weekly
budgets
of
every
family
in
all
classes
below
the
fourth
are
checked
by
the
authorities
by
which
department
i
do
not
know
and
if
the
amount
spent
on
drink
exceeds
a
certain
sum
per
head
a
fine
is
inflicted
and
the
offender
warned
if
the
offence
is
persisted
in
the
offender
is
forbidden
to
buy
any
drink
for
a
specified
period
one
might
suppose
that
such
regulations
could
easily
be
evaded
so
they
could
in
most
countries
but
not
in
meccania
everything
is
so
perfectly
scrutinised
that
no
evasion
seems
possible
at
any
rate
as
far
as
the
three
lowest
classes
are
concerned
this
scrutiny
of
family
budgets
i
remarked
is
it
not
resented
and
even
evaded
i
do
not
think
it
is
resented
answered
sheep
but
it
certainly
can
not
be
evaded
why
should
it
be
resented
the
facts
are
only
known
to
the
officials
and
in
any
case
they
would
be
required
by
the
sociological
department
how
else
could
it
obtain
the
necessary
data
for
its
researches
every
woman
is
taught
how
to
keep
her
household
accounts
in
the
proper
manner
and
she
sends
in
her
account
book
at
the
end
of
each
quarter
that
is
necessary
for
many
reasons
no
he
concluded
as
if
the
idea
had
not
occurred
to
him
before
i
have
never
heard
of
any
complaints
only
those
would
wish
to
complain
who
desired
to
evade
some
salutary
regulation
consequently
there
is
no
reason
why
out
of
regard
for
them
we
should
interfere
with
a
practice
that
has
so
many
advantages
what
are
the
advantages
i
asked
for
so
far
i
had
seen
no
advantage
except
the
possibility
of
checking
expenditure
upon
drink
the
use
of
these
accurate
family
budgets
and
household
accounts
to
the
sociological
department
is
simply
indispensable
to
the
department
of
trade
and
industry
also
they
are
very
valuable
in
fact
you
may
take
it
that
all
our
meccanian
institutions
are
so
arranged
that
they
serve
several
purposes
and
fit
in
with
the
whole
meccanian
scheme
of
life
incidentally
in
connection
with
the
family
expenditure
on
food
he
mentioned
model
dietaries
i
was
curious
to
know
what
these
were
he
explained
that
there
were
three
recognised
kinds
of
dietaries
first
the
food
department
prescribed
model
dietaries
for
families
of
the
three
lowest
classes
in
normal
health
secondly
when
each
person
was
medically
examined
and
this
happened
at
least
once
a
year
the
medical
officer
might
prescribe
a
dietary
for
the
individual
and
lastly
if
a
person
were
positively
ill
it
would
be
the
duty
of
the
medical
officer
in
charge
of
the
case
to
prescribe
a
dietary
i
was
going
to
ask
some
further
questions
about
the
medical
department
when
sheep
reminded
me
that
we
had
still
several
other
municipal
departments
to
visit
before
we
came
to
the
medical
department
and
that
we
must
not
depart
from
the
programme
of
our
tour
the
department
for
the
inspection
and
regulation
of
clothing
came
next
i
was
rather
surprised
that
this
should
be
a
municipal
institution
seeing
that
the
regulations
were
uniform
for
the
whole
country
sheep
explained
that
it
was
just
because
the
regulations
were
so
perfectly
uniform
that
the
function
of
administering
them
could
be
entrusted
to
the
municipality
the
department
was
quite
a
small
affair
only
about
ten
inspectors
were
required
for
bridgetown
their
duties
were
to
see
that
no
person
wore
any
uniform
to
which
he
was
not
entitled
and
that
on
ceremonial
occasions
uniform
was
worn
it
was
quite
easy
to
ensure
that
a
uniform
of
the
right
colour
was
worn
but
in
addition
to
that
the
various
grades
of
each
class
were
indicated
by
the
various
facings
stripes
buttons
and
badges
as
were
also
the
different
occupations
within
each
class
and
grade
the
penalties
for
wearing
unauthorised
decorations
were
very
heavy
and
infringements
were
very
rare
as
detection
was
almost
certain
i
should
have
thought
that
the
whole
clothing
trade
would
be
in
the
hands
of
the
government
i
remarked
that
is
not
part
of
our
system
replied
sheep
the
production
of
all
the
kinds
of
cloth
for
all
the
uniforms
is
so
standardised
that
there
would
be
no
advantage
in
the
state
taking
over
the
mere
manufacture
each
person
chooses
his
tailor
from
a
small
panel
naturally
the
members
of
the
higher
classes
have
the
best
tailors
in
fact
a
tailor
of
the
first
grade
would
not
be
allowed
to
make
suits
for
the
three
lowest
classes
it
would
be
a
waste
of
talent
and
what
about
the
women
clothing
i
inquired
they
do
not
wear
uniforms
is
their
dress
regulated
in
any
way
only
in
two
ways
answered
sheep
every
woman
must
wear
on
the
front
upper
part
of
each
of
her
outdoor
dresses
a
piece
of
cloth
of
the
regulation
pattern
and
colour
to
indicate
the
class
to
which
she
belongs
also
the
expenditure
on
dress
is
limited
according
to
the
social
class
when
we
came
to
the
offices
of
the
department
of
health
sheep
said
i
had
made
a
grave
error
of
judgment
in
choosing
tour
no
the
tour
for
a
single
week
only
as
there
was
enough
to
occupy
us
for
a
week
in
the
department
of
health
alone
it
included
the
sanitation
section
the
medical
inspection
section
the
medical
dispensing
section
the
medical
attendance
section
the
hospital
section
the
section
of
the
special
medical
board
the
marriages
and
births
section
the
section
and
the
buildings
section
after
this
i
was
not
surprised
to
hear
that
over
a
thousand
persons
were
employed
in
the
health
department
in
addition
to
the
workmen
chiefly
of
the
sixth
and
seventh
classes
who
did
the
actual
menial
work
of
keeping
the
sewage
system
in
order
and
keeping
the
streets
clean
i
might
write
a
whole
chapter
on
the
health
department
but
it
will
perhaps
suffice
if
i
mention
the
most
singular
features
inspectors
visit
every
house
twice
a
year
to
see
that
each
house
and
flat
is
kept
in
a
sanitary
condition
each
person
is
medically
examined
once
a
year
this
is
in
addition
to
the
system
of
medical
inspection
in
schools
and
whatever
treatment
is
prescribed
he
must
submit
to
what
happens
i
asked
if
a
person
declines
to
submit
to
treatment
he
would
be
taken
before
the
special
medical
board
answered
sheep
and
what
is
that
i
asked
we
shall
come
to
that
presently
said
sheep
reprovingly
he
went
on
to
explain
that
the
dispensing
section
treated
all
persons
of
the
three
lowest
classes
who
did
not
require
to
go
into
a
hospital
the
doctors
were
municipal
officials
and
there
was
no
choice
of
doctor
why
do
you
not
allow
choice
of
doctor
i
asked
that
would
interfere
with
the
proper
classification
of
the
diseases
he
answered
as
soon
as
a
complaint
is
diagnosed
it
is
handed
over
to
the
appropriate
doctor
for
treatment
the
same
applies
to
the
medical
attendance
section
but
persons
in
the
three
lowest
classes
are
not
generally
attended
in
their
homes
they
are
brought
into
the
hospitals
the
chief
work
of
the
medical
attendance
section
is
in
connection
with
births
consequently
we
employ
a
number
of
women
in
this
section
now
we
come
to
the
special
medical
board
it
is
a
sort
of
higher
general
staff
it
collates
the
results
of
the
work
of
all
the
other
medical
sections
and
is
responsible
for
the
annual
report
it
receives
the
instructions
of
the
central
medical
department
of
meccania
and
sees
that
these
are
carried
out
it
directs
special
investigations
in
all
abnormal
cases
in
the
case
of
incurable
diseases
it
pronounces
its
decree
as
to
whether
the
case
is
incurable
and
in
that
event
it
authorises
the
death
of
the
patient
authorises
the
death
of
the
patient
i
said
without
the
consent
the
patient
can
hardly
be
the
best
judge
said
sheep
what
about
the
relatives
then
i
asked
the
relatives
have
no
voice
in
the
matter
said
sheep
that
sounds
very
drastic
i
remarked
and
what
about
the
sort
of
case
you
mentioned
a
little
while
ago
the
case
mentioned
said
sheep
i
do
not
remember
any
such
cases
but
if
one
occurred
it
would
be
dealt
with
under
section
of
the
medical
regulations
which
prescribes
that
in
case
of
persistent
disregard
of
the
instructions
of
the
authorised
medical
officer
with
the
consent
of
the
special
medical
board
the
person
guilty
of
such
refusal
is
to
be
removed
to
an
asylum
for
mental
abnormality
a
lunatic
asylum
we
do
not
call
them
lunatic
asylums
the
term
is
obsolete
it
does
not
accord
with
our
system
of
classification
sheep
next
dealt
with
the
marriages
and
births
section
this
is
in
some
ways
the
most
remarkable
of
all
it
appears
that
a
licence
to
marry
is
issued
to
all
persons
in
normal
health
the
department
prescribing
the
number
of
children
to
be
born
within
each
period
of
five
years
persons
classified
as
abnormal
are
specially
dealt
with
and
on
this
subject
sheep
referred
me
to
the
report
of
the
central
medical
department
which
i
could
obtain
in
the
great
meccanian
library
at
mecco
the
section
carried
out
an
examination
in
all
cases
of
interest
to
the
health
department
before
cremation
i
asked
what
the
buildings
section
was
it
seems
to
be
a
sort
of
link
between
the
architectural
department
and
the
health
department
and
supervises
the
building
regulations
from
the
hygienic
point
of
view
the
next
day
conductor
sheep
called
punctually
at
nine
to
continue
the
tour
of
observation
we
had
come
to
the
end
of
one
section
as
marked
out
in
the
mind
of
the
and
were
now
to
begin
another
namely
the
institutions
controlled
partly
by
the
city
and
partly
by
the
state
i
suspect
that
the
control
by
the
city
is
a
good
deal
of
a
fiction
for
the
state
has
power
to
take
over
any
of
the
functions
that
are
not
performed
to
its
satisfaction
we
began
with
the
police
the
office
of
the
central
police
station
was
in
the
building
where
i
had
first
been
inspected
examined
and
instructed
on
my
arrival
it
was
a
large
building
for
a
town
of
the
size
of
bridgetown
and
seemed
full
of
officials
police
officers
and
clerks
yet
i
had
noticed
very
few
police
officers
in
the
streets
i
remarked
upon
this
to
my
guide
i
said
in
the
country
i
have
just
come
from
they
have
a
great
many
police
officers
in
the
streets
of
the
large
towns
but
very
few
other
officials
connected
with
the
police
service
here
apparently
you
have
few
police
officers
in
the
streets
but
a
great
many
other
officials
connected
with
the
police
service
can
you
explain
that
yes
he
said
i
have
heard
something
of
the
kind
before
and
although
i
have
never
been
abroad
to
other
countries
the
books
in
our
libraries
describe
the
police
systems
so
fully
that
i
think
i
can
answer
your
question
the
police
in
luniland
so
i
am
informed
do
little
else
besides
keeping
order
in
the
streets
and
following
up
criminals
exactly
i
remarked
what
else
should
they
do
here
said
sheep
these
are
the
least
of
their
functions
we
employ
fewer
police
in
keeping
order
in
the
streets
and
in
detecting
criminals
than
any
country
in
the
world
crime
and
disorder
are
almost
unknown
in
meccania
our
people
are
so
well
brought
up
that
they
have
little
desire
to
commit
crime
those
who
do
show
any
propensity
in
that
direction
are
deported
to
criminal
colonies
and
give
very
little
trouble
afterwards
besides
there
is
after
all
very
little
opportunity
to
commit
crime
as
you
would
soon
discover
if
you
attempted
to
do
so
i
can
well
believe
that
i
said
but
what
then
do
your
police
find
to
do
speaking
generally
their
function
is
to
see
that
the
regulations
devised
for
the
good
of
the
state
are
properly
carried
out
and
those
regulations
are
rather
numerous
i
suppose
undoubtedly
as
they
affect
every
department
of
life
there
are
many
occasions
upon
which
the
assistance
of
the
police
is
necessary
in
order
that
people
shall
not
make
mistakes
said
sheep
but
i
said
i
thought
that
the
officials
of
each
department
of
state
attended
to
so
many
things
that
there
would
be
little
left
for
the
police
for
instance
i
added
the
inspectors
of
food
and
clothing
of
buildings
of
public
health
of
education
and
so
forth
yes
yes
answered
conductor
sheep
but
suppose
some
matter
arises
which
may
belong
to
several
departments
the
citizen
needs
guidance
quite
apart
from
that
the
police
watch
over
the
life
of
the
people
from
the
point
of
view
of
the
general
public
interest
they
collect
information
from
all
the
other
departments
suppose
a
man
neglects
his
attendance
at
the
theatre
the
amusement
authority
must
report
the
case
to
the
police
similarly
with
all
the
other
departments
suppose
for
instance
a
man
were
to
try
to
make
an
unauthorised
journey
or
to
remain
absent
from
work
without
a
medical
certificate
or
to
exceed
his
proper
expenditure
and
get
into
debt
or
try
to
pass
himself
off
as
a
member
of
a
higher
class
in
such
cases
it
is
the
police
who
take
cognisance
of
the
offence
then
there
is
the
annual
report
and
certificate
of
conduct
with
respect
to
every
citizen
how
could
this
be
filled
up
without
exact
information
all
this
involves
a
great
deal
of
work
indeed
it
must
i
replied
you
see
then
that
our
police
are
not
idle
said
sheep
triumphantly
indeed
i
do
i
replied
after
this
enlightening
explanation
the
offices
of
the
police
department
no
longer
presented
a
mystery
to
me
i
looked
with
awe
at
the
hundreds
of
volumes
of
police
reports
in
the
official
library
of
the
bridgetown
police
office
and
wondered
what
the
central
police
office
library
would
be
like
for
i
was
told
it
contained
a
copy
of
every
police
report
of
every
district
in
the
country
as
well
as
those
for
the
great
capital
mecco
when
we
came
to
the
department
of
education
which
was
one
of
the
institutions
managed
by
the
state
and
the
municipality
conductor
sheep
regretted
once
more
that
i
had
chosen
tour
no
we
could
only
spare
half
a
day
at
most
for
this
important
department
here
again
i
can
only
note
a
few
of
the
unusual
features
of
the
system
as
explained
to
me
by
my
encyclopædic
conductor
we
saw
no
schools
except
on
the
outside
but
i
noticed
the
children
going
to
and
from
school
they
all
marched
in
step
in
twos
or
fours
like
little
soldiers
they
did
not
race
about
the
streets
or
play
games
wherever
they
started
from
they
fell
into
step
with
their
comrades
and
carried
their
satchels
like
knapsacks
the
state
inspectors
it
seems
decide
what
is
to
be
taught
and
how
it
is
to
be
taught
the
local
officers
carry
out
their
instructions
and
classify
the
children
in
the
office
of
the
department
there
is
a
sort
of
museum
of
school
apparatus
in
connection
with
the
stores
section
the
books
are
all
prescribed
by
the
central
department
and
no
others
may
be
used
the
children
of
the
sixth
and
seventh
classes
attend
common
schools
in
order
to
get
the
benefit
of
better
classification
there
are
no
schools
in
bridgetown
for
the
members
of
the
first
and
second
classes
they
go
elsewhere
but
the
other
classes
have
separate
schools
the
children
of
the
sixth
and
seventh
classes
stay
at
school
until
they
are
twelve
but
their
instruction
is
largely
of
a
practical
and
manual
kind
those
of
the
fifth
class
remain
until
fifteen
and
are
trained
to
be
skilled
workmen
after
fifteen
they
receive
instruction
in
science
in
connection
with
their
several
occupations
closely
connected
with
the
system
of
education
for
the
three
lowest
classes
is
the
juvenile
bureau
of
industry
this
is
controlled
by
the
department
of
industry
and
commerce
no
young
person
in
meccania
can
take
up
any
employment
without
a
certificate
granted
by
this
department
the
officials
of
the
juvenile
bureau
after
consultation
with
the
officials
of
the
education
department
decide
what
occupation
boys
and
girls
may
enter
and
no
employer
is
allowed
to
engage
a
boy
or
girl
except
through
the
medium
of
the
bureau
what
about
the
inclinations
of
the
boys
and
girls
and
the
desires
of
their
parents
i
remarked
to
sheep
the
inclinations
of
the
boys
said
sheep
more
puzzled
than
surprised
in
what
way
does
that
affect
the
question
a
boy
might
like
to
be
a
rather
than
a
metal
worker
or
a
mason
rather
than
a
clerk
i
said
but
such
a
question
as
that
will
have
been
determined
while
the
boy
is
at
school
then
when
does
he
get
the
chance
of
choosing
an
occupation
it
will
depend
upon
his
abilities
for
different
kinds
of
work
and
he
can
hardly
be
the
judge
of
that
himself
added
sheep
where
do
the
parents
come
in
then
i
asked
the
parents
will
naturally
encourage
the
boy
to
do
his
best
at
school
and
after
all
does
it
matter
much
whether
a
boy
is
a
mason
or
a
carpenter
in
any
case
the
number
of
carpenters
will
be
decided
each
year
and
even
each
quarter
by
the
department
of
industry
it
is
not
as
if
it
would
alter
his
class
either
he
will
be
in
the
same
class
unless
he
is
very
exceptional
and
passes
the
state
examination
for
promotion
i
saw
it
would
be
useless
to
suggest
any
other
ideas
to
sheep
who
seemed
constitutionally
unable
to
understand
any
objections
to
the
official
point
of
view
i
could
hardly
hope
to
learn
much
about
education
in
a
single
afternoon
all
we
saw
was
the
mere
machinery
from
the
outside
and
not
even
a
great
deal
of
that
i
gathered
that
there
was
a
most
minute
classification
with
all
sorts
of
subdivisions
of
the
children
according
to
their
capacities
and
future
occupations
there
were
sufficient
local
inspectors
to
provide
one
for
each
large
school
and
their
chief
business
was
to
conduct
psychological
experiments
and
apply
all
sorts
of
tests
of
intelligence
in
order
to
introduce
improved
methods
of
instruction
the
inspectors
themselves
were
all
specialists
one
was
an
expert
on
mental
fatigue
another
devoted
himself
to
classifying
the
teachers
according
to
their
aptitude
for
teaching
particular
subjects
another
specialised
in
organising
profitable
recreative
employments
for
different
grades
of
children
another
superintended
all
juvenile
amusements
sheep
showed
me
the
exterior
of
a
large
psychological
laboratory
attached
to
the
technical
college
bridgetown
was
too
small
to
have
a
university
of
its
own
but
it
had
two
large
schools
for
pupils
in
the
third
and
fourth
classes
and
an
enormous
technical
school
for
the
boys
of
the
fifth
class
it
was
fitted
up
like
a
series
of
workshops
for
all
sorts
of
trades
with
and
laboratories
attached
sheep
asserted
that
it
was
through
these
schools
that
the
meccanian
artisans
had
become
by
far
the
most
efficient
workmen
in
the
whole
world
i
had
not
time
to
ask
many
questions
about
the
provision
for
games
or
physical
training
but
from
something
sheep
said
i
inferred
that
whilst
games
had
been
reduced
to
a
minimum
the
experts
had
devised
a
system
of
physical
training
which
satisfied
all
meccanian
requirements
sheep
strongly
advised
me
to
study
meccanian
education
in
mecco
if
i
ever
got
there
all
true
meccanians
recognised
he
said
that
the
whole
national
greatness
of
meccania
rested
on
their
system
of
education
no
doubt
statesmen
had
done
much
but
the
ground
had
been
prepared
by
the
schoolmasters
and
the
statesmen
themselves
had
been
brought
up
in
the
meccanian
system
of
education
he
himself
he
confided
was
the
son
of
a
meccanian
village
schoolmaster
why
then
i
asked
begging
his
pardon
if
the
question
were
indiscreet
did
he
wear
the
chocolate
button
which
indicated
that
he
had
once
been
a
member
of
the
fifth
class
when
the
sevenfold
classification
was
introduced
he
answered
village
schoolmasters
who
were
not
graduates
were
in
the
fifth
class
and
i
was
in
the
fifth
class
until
i
was
thirty
and
gained
my
promotion
in
the
police
department
tour
no
made
no
provision
for
studying
the
lighter
side
of
life
in
bridgetown
sheep
said
that
practically
all
forms
of
amusement
were
controlled
by
a
section
of
the
department
of
culture
but
that
the
organising
inspectors
of
private
leisure
were
appointed
locally
subject
to
the
approval
of
the
central
department
organising
inspectors
of
private
leisure
i
exclaimed
what
an
extraordinary
institution
in
what
way
extraordinary
said
sheep
i
am
sure
they
do
not
exist
in
any
other
country
i
replied
perhaps
not
replied
sheep
but
then
our
culture
is
not
modelled
on
that
of
any
other
country
possibly
other
countries
will
discover
the
use
of
such
officials
when
they
have
developed
a
better
system
of
education
but
what
is
their
function
i
asked
any
person
who
has
more
than
an
hour
a
day
unaccounted
for
after
doing
his
day
work
and
fulfilling
all
his
other
duties
is
required
to
submit
a
scheme
every
showing
what
cultural
pursuit
he
proposes
to
follow
the
inspectors
will
assist
him
with
expert
advice
and
will
see
that
he
carries
out
his
programme
is
there
nothing
left
unregulated
in
this
country
i
asked
in
as
innocent
a
tone
as
i
could
command
that
is
a
very
interesting
question
replied
sheep
if
you
will
consult
the
annual
report
of
the
ministry
of
you
will
find
an
interesting
diagram
or
map
showing
the
whole
field
of
meccanian
life
and
the
stages
in
its
organisation
one
by
one
all
the
spheres
of
life
have
been
gradually
organised
if
you
examine
the
diagram
showing
the
present
state
of
meccania
and
compare
it
with
similar
maps
for
other
countries
you
will
perceive
how
very
much
more
advanced
our
culture
is
than
that
of
any
other
country
and
what
regions
still
remain
for
the
department
of
culture
to
conquer
an
investigation
is
going
on
at
the
present
time
into
the
interesting
question
of
individual
taste
he
answered
it
is
being
conducted
by
the
æsthetic
section
of
the
department
but
they
have
not
yet
reported
where
everything
is
so
completely
regulated
it
is
not
surprising
to
find
that
poverty
as
understood
in
many
countries
no
longer
exists
but
i
was
not
quite
clear
how
it
was
provided
against
once
more
sheep
was
ready
with
a
complete
explanation
our
laws
he
said
do
not
permit
anyone
to
remain
idle
and
the
regulation
of
the
expenditure
of
the
lower
classes
secures
them
against
improvidence
besides
as
they
contribute
to
insurance
funds
they
receive
a
pension
in
old
age
and
allowances
during
sickness
or
disablement
poverty
is
therefore
impossible
apparently
then
i
remarked
if
the
labouring
classes
will
surrender
their
liberty
to
the
state
they
can
be
relieved
of
all
danger
of
poverty
i
do
not
understand
what
you
mean
by
surrendering
their
liberty
replied
sheep
in
many
other
countries
i
said
people
desire
to
please
themselves
what
they
will
work
at
and
indeed
whether
they
will
work
at
all
they
like
to
have
the
liberty
of
striking
for
instance
against
wages
or
other
conditions
that
do
not
satisfy
them
and
i
have
heard
people
in
such
countries
declare
that
they
would
rather
preserve
their
freedom
in
such
things
than
be
secured
even
against
poverty
it
is
no
part
of
my
business
to
discuss
such
questions
replied
sheep
but
i
have
never
heard
such
a
question
even
discussed
in
meccania
the
foundation
of
meccanian
law
is
that
the
private
individual
has
no
rights
against
the
state
it
was
towards
the
end
of
the
week
that
i
mentioned
to
conductor
sheep
that
i
had
had
great
difficulty
in
procuring
a
copy
of
the
local
newspaper
published
in
bridgetown
in
fact
i
had
not
managed
to
get
a
sight
of
it
sheep
explained
that
tour
no
did
not
allow
time
for
the
study
of
local
social
life
in
such
detail
as
to
provide
a
place
for
such
a
thing
but
he
was
good
enough
to
procure
me
a
sight
of
the
weekly
it
was
well
printed
on
good
paper
but
it
was
more
like
an
official
municipal
record
than
a
newspaper
it
contained
brief
reports
of
municipal
committee
meetings
announcements
as
to
forthcoming
examinations
lists
of
persons
who
had
passed
various
examinations
and
statistics
of
births
deaths
and
marriages
the
figures
for
the
births
were
given
in
an
unusual
form
there
were
fifty
boys
girls
boys
girls
and
so
on
down
to
three
boys
and
seven
girls
there
were
statistics
of
accidents
with
brief
details
there
was
a
list
of
small
fines
inflicted
for
various
infringements
of
regulations
and
announcements
of
forthcoming
legal
cases
the
only
advertisements
were
a
few
concerning
sales
of
property
and
household
goods
it
was
altogether
the
driest
document
calling
itself
a
newspaper
i
had
ever
seen
i
tried
to
draw
sheep
on
the
subject
of
newspapers
in
general
but
he
seemed
rather
annoyed
i
procured
this
he
said
as
a
concession
to
your
curiosity
although
it
forms
no
part
of
our
programme
and
now
you
wish
to
go
into
a
subject
which
is
totally
unconnected
with
our
tour
the
question
is
of
historical
interest
only
and
if
you
stay
in
meccania
long
enough
to
study
the
historical
development
of
our
culture
you
will
study
the
history
of
the
press
in
its
proper
place
and
connection
i
will
however
add
for
your
present
information
that
the
central
government
issues
a
complete
series
of
gazettes
which
serve
the
same
purpose
for
the
country
as
a
whole
as
the
weekly
for
his
locality
with
that
the
subject
was
closed
for
the
present
although
i
had
now
been
here
nearly
a
whole
week
i
had
not
yet
had
an
opportunity
of
strolling
round
to
see
anything
that
might
catch
my
fancy
everything
had
been
done
according
to
the
programme
nevertheless
i
had
noticed
a
few
things
in
the
course
of
my
daily
tours
which
conductor
sheep
did
not
think
worthy
of
comment
i
got
very
tired
of
his
style
of
explanation
bridgetown
was
hardly
worth
the
painful
and
systematic
study
which
he
compelled
me
to
give
to
it
and
i
decided
to
go
straight
on
to
the
capital
in
a
few
days
i
saw
no
drunken
people
the
regulations
do
not
permit
drunkenness
i
saw
no
loose
women
in
the
streets
on
this
subject
i
can
get
no
information
from
sheep
but
i
suspect
there
is
something
to
learn
there
were
no
advertisement
hoardings
i
must
confess
i
rather
missed
them
they
may
be
ugly
but
they
are
often
interesting
the
shops
were
very
dull
nothing
was
displayed
in
the
windows
to
tempt
people
to
buy
and
there
were
no
people
about
the
streets
shopping
in
a
casual
way
people
must
know
what
they
want
and
go
to
the
shops
which
specialise
in
the
particular
article
there
were
large
stores
but
even
these
were
so
divided
into
departments
that
there
was
little
fun
in
shopping
indiscriminate
and
casual
shopping
is
distinctly
discouraged
by
the
state
advertising
is
restricted
to
trade
journals
except
for
a
little
in
the
miserable
local
gazettes
only
those
forms
of
production
which
the
state
considers
necessary
are
allowed
to
expand
indefinitely
all
the
others
are
regulated
consequently
there
are
none
of
the
incitements
to
expenditure
which
exist
in
most
modern
countries
i
have
never
been
a
great
shopper
but
i
could
not
have
believed
how
much
duller
life
was
without
the
attractions
of
the
shop
windows
and
the
stores
if
i
had
not
been
here
for
instance
i
found
that
i
had
very
foolishly
come
without
a
pair
of
bedroom
slippers
so
i
wanted
to
buy
a
pair
i
looked
round
naturally
for
a
shop
where
i
should
see
such
things
displayed
in
the
window
but
i
had
to
go
to
the
slipper
section
of
the
boot
department
of
a
store
choose
from
an
illustrated
catalogue
the
quality
i
wanted
and
take
whatever
they
had
i
thought
i
should
have
seen
displaying
all
the
most
recent
books
and
publications
in
other
countries
i
found
it
possible
to
pick
up
a
great
deal
of
information
by
noticing
the
kind
of
literature
exposed
for
sale
booksellers
shops
have
always
an
attraction
for
me
to
my
amazement
the
shops
have
disappeared
from
meccania
yet
i
know
from
my
own
reading
they
used
to
be
quite
a
feature
in
the
life
of
the
old
meccania
the
censorship
of
the
printing
trade
has
apparently
revolutionised
the
business
at
any
rate
the
only
place
in
which
i
could
get
to
see
books
in
bridgetown
was
at
a
sort
of
office
in
the
technical
college
it
seems
that
the
publications
department
of
the
ministry
of
culture
i
think
that
is
the
right
name
has
in
every
town
a
public
room
fitted
up
like
a
small
library
in
which
all
the
current
books
published
are
exhibited
for
six
months
at
a
time
this
is
really
a
very
useful
institution
in
itself
but
the
books
exhibited
were
not
on
sale
so
all
the
pleasurable
excitement
of
a
was
wanting
to
books
one
must
order
them
through
an
authorised
who
has
a
sort
of
monopoly
i
wondered
why
such
an
extraordinary
arrangement
should
have
been
made
but
when
i
got
the
explanation
from
sheep
it
was
quite
consistent
with
the
general
scheme
of
things
here
i
asked
him
whether
the
government
discouraged
the
public
from
reading
he
said
not
at
all
our
people
are
great
readers
they
do
not
need
any
incitements
to
read
they
consult
the
lists
of
new
books
and
come
to
the
to
see
any
book
in
which
they
are
interested
then
they
decide
whether
to
buy
it
or
to
borrow
it
from
the
public
library
but
why
do
you
not
permit
people
to
open
it
would
be
a
sheer
waste
replied
sheep
one
can
supply
all
the
books
required
in
bridgetown
without
keeping
a
stock
of
thousands
of
books
that
would
never
be
wanted
or
not
wanted
for
years
apply
the
same
principle
to
other
towns
and
you
will
see
that
by
keeping
only
one
central
stock
we
effect
a
great
economy
i
pointed
out
that
in
other
countries
the
publishers
kept
the
stock
and
supplied
booksellers
with
what
they
wanted
allowing
them
to
keep
a
few
copies
for
the
immediate
sales
and
that
consequently
this
was
almost
as
economical
an
arrangement
but
said
sheep
we
have
no
publishers
in
your
sense
of
the
word
when
a
book
is
written
it
can
not
be
printed
without
the
sanction
of
the
government
censors
who
decide
how
many
copies
in
the
first
instance
are
to
be
issued
the
publishers
are
really
printers
who
arrange
the
form
and
style
of
the
book
but
undertake
no
responsibility
such
as
publishers
in
other
countries
undertake
then
the
government
are
really
the
publishers
i
suggested
well
answered
sheep
the
government
the
publishers
of
most
books
that
is
to
say
the
number
of
government
publications
exceeds
the
number
of
private
publications
but
as
regards
the
latter
the
publishers
or
printers
assume
the
financial
responsibility
for
the
sales
but
are
insured
by
the
government
against
loss
so
long
as
they
comply
with
the
conditions
imposed
by
the
publishing
department
but
i
have
digressed
too
far
my
interest
in
must
be
my
excuse
not
only
were
there
no
casual
shoppers
but
i
saw
no
one
sauntering
about
the
streets
everybody
seemed
to
have
an
object
in
view
there
were
no
children
playing
the
children
were
either
marching
in
step
to
or
from
school
or
they
were
performing
some
kind
of
organised
game
if
it
could
be
called
a
game
under
the
supervision
of
a
teacher
or
guardian
the
workmen
going
to
their
work
or
returning
also
marched
in
step
like
soldiers
the
women
going
to
market
went
at
the
appointed
time
and
took
their
place
in
a
little
queue
if
there
were
more
than
three
or
four
in
front
of
them
at
the
theatre
there
was
no
crowd
outside
every
one
had
his
numbered
seat
and
went
to
it
at
the
minute
each
man
ticket
has
printed
on
it
the
day
of
his
attendance
the
number
of
the
seat
and
the
exact
time
at
which
he
must
be
present
there
are
no
such
things
here
as
football
matches
or
other
sports
witnessed
by
crowds
the
men
attend
military
drill
once
a
week
some
on
sundays
and
some
on
saturdays
this
is
in
addition
to
their
annual
periods
of
drill
the
only
custom
which
survives
from
old
times
resembling
the
customs
of
other
countries
is
that
of
sitting
in
the
evening
in
gardens
attached
to
restaurants
here
the
people
listen
to
bands
of
music
whilst
they
drink
a
thin
kind
of
liquor
and
smoke
cigars
the
sense
of
orderliness
is
almost
oppressive
every
hour
of
the
day
has
been
mapped
out
for
me
except
when
i
have
been
writing
my
journal
in
the
evening
the
day
before
yesterday
we
began
to
visit
the
state
institutions
the
chief
of
these
is
the
post
office
but
the
most
remarkable
is
the
time
department
the
post
office
is
very
much
like
any
other
post
office
except
that
it
has
a
censor
department
all
letters
are
actually
read
by
the
clerks
in
the
censor
department
sheep
gave
me
a
curious
explanation
in
justification
of
this
extraordinary
institution
put
briefly
his
case
was
this
the
state
could
not
with
due
regard
to
the
interests
of
the
community
allow
letters
to
go
uncensored
all
sorts
of
mischief
might
be
hatched
if
the
state
censors
any
letters
it
can
not
logically
stop
short
of
censoring
all
as
to
the
labour
involved
this
pays
for
itself
for
the
public
knowing
that
its
letters
are
liable
to
be
read
does
not
indulge
in
unnecessary
thus
time
is
saved
which
can
be
devoted
to
more
useful
purposes
the
statistics
compiled
by
the
time
department
have
completely
proved
that
the
labour
of
the
fifty
clerks
employed
in
censoring
the
letters
effects
a
saving
of
more
than
four
times
the
amount
of
time
which
would
otherwise
be
spent
by
the
public
in
useless
this
time
department
is
the
most
extraordinary
institution
of
all
i
have
seen
so
far
every
person
over
ten
years
of
age
is
required
to
fill
in
a
each
week
showing
the
time
spent
daily
on
every
separate
operation
the
diary
form
is
a
stout
double
sheet
of
foolscap
providing
four
pages
altogether
the
first
page
is
stamped
with
the
name
address
and
other
particulars
of
the
the
two
open
pages
are
ruled
into
small
oblong
spaces
one
for
each
of
the
week
in
these
spaces
brief
entries
are
made
such
as
etc
this
part
of
the
diary
thus
gives
a
chronological
account
of
each
day
in
successive
on
the
back
page
is
printed
a
long
list
of
about
categories
in
three
columns
i
noticed
such
headings
as
these
sleep
dressing
meals
subdivided
travelling
conveyance
specified
employment
specified
under
many
heads
study
specified
reading
interviews
with
officials
attendance
at
theatre
concert
church
museum
conversation
subdivided
into
family
friends
others
other
amusements
specified
public
ceremonies
drill
etc
against
each
of
these
headings
the
total
number
of
minutes
spent
during
the
week
is
recorded
the
information
derived
from
these
diaries
is
scrutinised
and
worked
up
into
elaborate
reports
and
statistics
for
the
benefit
of
the
sociological
department
the
police
department
the
department
of
trade
and
industry
and
so
forth
i
hope
to
learn
more
of
this
most
remarkable
feature
of
meccanian
life
when
i
reach
the
capital
where
the
central
time
department
carries
on
its
work
i
have
good
reason
to
remember
the
time
department
for
on
sunday
morning
after
breakfast
i
was
sent
for
by
the
official
who
manages
the
hotel
for
foreign
observers
he
told
me
rather
curtly
that
he
had
just
received
a
telephone
message
from
the
local
office
of
the
time
department
inquiring
whether
i
had
sent
in
my
diary
as
it
had
not
been
received
i
told
him
i
knew
nothing
about
such
a
thing
he
said
nonsense
you
have
had
the
usual
instructions
given
to
all
foreigners
look
among
your
papers
i
did
look
and
there
sure
enough
was
a
sheet
of
instructions
and
three
blank
forms
he
said
you
had
better
fill
it
up
at
once
so
i
went
to
the
and
began
but
i
could
not
remember
what
had
happened
at
all
clearly
enough
to
fill
the
half
of
it
in
at
the
end
of
an
hour
the
hotel
manager
came
to
ask
what
i
was
doing
all
this
time
i
explained
my
difficulty
he
asked
if
i
had
not
kept
a
it
was
indispensable
i
suddenly
remembered
the
sheep
had
procured
for
me
but
i
had
forgotten
to
make
use
of
it
what
a
fool
i
was
we
spent
the
next
hour
doctoring
up
the
diary
and
then
sent
it
in
he
told
me
i
should
have
to
pay
a
fine
of
ten
shillings
for
the
delay
i
did
not
mind
that
but
the
next
day
i
received
a
visit
from
an
official
from
the
time
department
who
came
with
conductor
sheep
to
point
out
that
there
were
many
errors
in
the
diary
the
times
for
a
number
of
items
did
not
tally
with
those
in
conductor
sheep
diary
although
we
had
been
together
the
whole
week
from
to
each
day
i
should
have
to
make
out
a
fresh
diary
with
the
assistance
of
conductor
sheep
and
pay
a
fine
of
the
charge
of
falsifying
my
diary
would
not
be
made
in
view
of
my
colossal
ignorance
the
charge
would
be
reduced
to
that
of
negligence
to
verify
particulars
conductor
sheep
was
rather
disagreeable
about
the
affair
as
it
might
be
considered
to
reflect
on
him
i
certainly
thought
he
might
have
taken
the
trouble
to
instruct
me
more
fully
upon
such
a
momentous
business
however
as
i
was
on
the
point
of
leaving
bridgetown
for
mecco
i
was
not
much
disturbed
by
his
chapter
iii
introduction
to
mecco
it
is
a
week
since
i
arrived
in
mecco
and
for
the
first
time
i
have
leisure
to
write
up
my
journal
the
life
of
a
foreign
observer
is
very
strenuous
for
the
meccanian
method
of
seeing
everything
according
to
programme
and
timetable
is
very
fatiguing
already
i
feel
that
a
holiday
will
be
welcome
at
the
end
of
my
tour
in
the
whole
of
this
vast
city
of
mecco
there
is
nothing
casual
nothing
incidental
nothing
unprovided
for
although
i
am
only
a
spectator
i
feel
like
a
little
cog
in
the
huge
complicated
machine
the
machine
seems
to
absorb
everything
the
individual
counts
for
nothing
that
is
perhaps
the
reason
why
it
seems
impossible
to
get
into
contact
with
any
human
being
other
than
the
officials
who
instruct
me
and
conduct
me
every
moment
of
my
time
i
begin
to
wonder
whether
the
individual
meccanian
really
exists
or
whether
his
personality
is
merged
in
the
official
personality
which
is
all
that
is
visible
to
me
to
resume
the
record
of
my
experiences
before
i
left
bridgetown
sheep
repeated
his
opinion
that
in
choosing
tour
no
which
allowed
only
a
week
for
the
study
of
an
important
town
i
had
revealed
my
incapacity
as
a
foreign
observer
he
evidently
put
me
down
in
one
of
the
of
his
mind
as
a
mere
tourist
a
creature
almost
extinct
in
meccania
the
day
before
my
departure
i
paid
the
bill
for
his
services
which
were
reckoned
at
the
modest
rate
of
a
day
my
hotel
bill
was
also
discharged
and
i
proceeded
to
my
final
interview
with
the
police
authorities
i
had
to
submit
to
another
disinfecting
bath
but
apart
from
this
the
medical
examination
was
a
formality
at
the
police
office
inspector
of
foreigners
stiff
was
very
sarcastic
at
my
expense
so
you
think
there
is
nothing
more
to
be
learnt
in
bridgetown
he
remarked
it
is
not
more
than
ten
days
since
you
left
luniland
and
you
think
yourself
qualified
to
proceed
to
the
very
centre
of
our
national
culture
evidently
your
stay
in
luniland
has
not
improved
whatever
powers
of
appreciation
you
may
have
possessed
but
that
is
what
one
would
expect
from
that
country
of
amateurs
charlatans
and
cranks
you
have
seen
nothing
of
our
museum
our
art
collections
our
libraries
you
are
not
interested
in
such
things
how
then
do
you
suppose
you
will
be
able
to
appreciate
what
you
will
find
in
mecco
we
do
our
best
to
assist
all
foreign
observers
but
it
is
rather
a
waste
of
time
to
provide
an
experienced
and
qualified
conductor
for
persons
who
are
so
clever
that
they
only
require
a
week
to
learn
all
there
is
to
know
in
a
whole
city
however
he
added
the
law
with
respect
to
foreign
observers
does
not
forbid
you
to
proceed
to
mecco
you
have
your
medical
certificate
i
suppose
to
show
that
you
are
still
i
produced
it
have
you
notified
the
railway
authority
of
your
intention
to
travel
to
mecco
i
had
not
done
so
turn
to
paragraph
of
your
instructions
and
you
will
see
that
a
day
notice
must
be
given
he
said
brusquely
you
will
have
to
stay
another
night
in
the
hotel
and
travel
good
morning
sheep
accompanied
me
to
the
at
the
station
where
i
filled
up
a
form
of
application
when
this
was
presented
to
the
clerk
in
charge
a
fussy
little
old
man
in
a
uniform
he
turned
to
sheep
in
great
excitement
and
whispered
something
which
i
did
not
hear
then
he
turned
indignantly
to
me
and
said
but
you
are
not
an
ambassador
nor
even
a
government
agent
no
i
said
i
am
merely
national
councillor
ming
so
i
see
he
answered
testily
but
why
do
you
wish
to
travel
first
class
i
had
filled
in
the
word
first
in
the
space
for
class
are
you
not
aware
he
said
that
only
foreigners
who
are
ambassadors
are
ever
permitted
to
travel
first
class
you
will
travel
third
class
in
the
compartment
for
foreign
observers
next
morning
i
went
to
the
station
in
good
time
an
attendant
from
the
hotel
brought
my
bags
over
and
handed
them
to
one
of
the
porters
i
did
not
see
them
again
until
i
found
them
in
the
hotel
at
mecco
i
was
handed
over
to
an
official
at
the
station
this
person
looked
at
my
and
informed
me
curtly
that
i
had
arrived
too
early
i
said
oh
that
does
not
matter
i
can
look
about
the
station
until
the
train
starts
that
is
not
permitted
he
said
you
will
go
to
the
that
is
what
a
is
for
your
train
will
come
in
a
quarter
of
an
hour
before
it
is
due
to
leave
and
you
will
then
take
your
seat
coach
third
class
compartment
seat
no
so
i
was
taken
to
the
apparently
i
did
not
miss
much
of
interest
for
the
station
was
one
of
the
quietest
and
dullest
i
have
ever
seen
there
is
very
little
traffic
across
the
frontier
so
that
bridgetown
station
is
a
sort
of
only
three
passenger
trains
a
day
go
direct
to
mecco
and
these
are
by
no
means
crowded
i
have
since
learnt
that
the
restrictions
on
travelling
in
all
parts
of
meccania
are
part
of
the
general
policy
designed
to
keep
down
unnecessary
forms
of
expenditure
to
a
minimum
the
train
was
due
to
leave
at
ten
at
a
quarter
before
ten
exactly
as
i
looked
through
the
window
screen
i
saw
it
gliding
along
the
platform
into
the
bay
a
bell
rang
and
my
porter
came
to
take
me
to
my
place
as
i
stepped
across
the
platform
i
saw
about
a
hundred
people
preparing
to
get
into
the
train
where
they
had
been
up
to
this
moment
i
do
not
know
there
was
no
bustle
each
person
took
his
place
as
if
he
had
been
taking
his
seat
in
a
there
was
no
examination
of
tickets
every
one
had
booked
his
seat
the
day
before
and
every
seat
was
numbered
the
train
was
made
up
of
five
passenger
coaches
a
van
a
baggage
wagon
two
wagons
for
perishable
goods
and
a
special
coach
for
soldiers
privates
one
of
the
passenger
coaches
painted
red
bore
a
large
roman
indicating
that
it
was
a
second
class
coach
another
painted
yellow
was
marked
two
others
painted
green
were
marked
and
another
painted
chocolate
was
marked
there
was
no
first
class
coach
on
this
train
as
there
were
no
persons
of
the
first
class
travelling
by
it
neither
apparently
were
there
any
sixth
or
seventh
class
passengers
every
one
travelling
wore
a
sort
of
uniform
overcoat
of
the
same
colour
as
that
of
the
coach
in
which
he
travelled
it
was
only
later
that
i
was
able
to
recognise
readily
and
without
confusion
the
colours
appropriate
to
the
seven
social
classes
but
i
did
notice
that
the
fifth
class
wore
chocolate
the
fourth
green
the
third
yellow
and
the
second
red
or
scarlet
i
was
taken
to
a
compartment
temporarily
set
apart
for
foreigners
in
the
third
class
coach
there
was
still
ten
minutes
before
the
train
started
so
i
looked
out
of
the
window
and
saw
the
porters
and
minor
officials
storing
the
luggage
putting
in
the
mails
and
so
forth
the
perishable
goods
had
already
been
loaded
in
a
siding
i
suppose
no
one
was
permitted
on
the
platform
except
the
railway
servants
so
that
the
station
looked
almost
deserted
presently
the
stationmaster
dressed
in
a
green
uniform
with
chocolate
facings
and
a
bit
of
gold
braid
on
his
cap
came
on
the
platform
and
looked
at
his
watch
then
exactly
as
the
big
bell
of
the
station
clock
began
to
strike
ten
he
waved
a
signal
and
the
train
glided
out
in
a
few
minutes
we
were
going
at
miles
an
hour
and
in
less
than
a
quarter
of
an
hour
the
speed
increased
to
the
track
was
smooth
but
i
began
to
feel
dizzy
when
i
looked
out
of
the
window
there
was
little
to
be
seen
for
every
now
and
then
we
passed
between
embankments
that
shut
out
the
view
i
pulled
down
the
blinds
turned
on
the
light
and
tried
to
read
in
a
short
time
i
had
almost
forgotten
the
immense
speed
at
which
we
were
travelling
i
had
previously
learnt
that
if
i
went
to
mecco
by
the
express
i
should
see
nothing
of
the
country
and
had
consequently
proposed
to
travel
by
a
stopping
train
perhaps
breaking
my
journey
a
few
times
but
when
i
mentioned
this
to
sheep
he
said
it
would
be
impossible
i
could
not
stop
at
any
place
to
make
a
stay
of
less
than
three
days
and
each
of
the
places
i
stopped
at
would
have
to
be
notified
i
must
either
go
direct
to
mecco
or
to
some
other
city
so
here
i
was
almost
flying
to
mecco
after
about
an
hour
one
of
the
guards
came
in
to
see
that
everything
was
in
order
he
wore
a
chocolate
uniform
with
a
number
of
stripes
and
other
symbols
to
indicate
his
particular
grade
occupation
and
years
of
service
after
stamping
my
ticket
he
grinned
for
a
meccanian
and
said
so
you
are
going
to
see
the
wonders
of
our
wonderful
mecco
lucky
man
there
is
nothing
like
it
anywhere
in
the
world
indeed
i
said
you
have
travelled
abroad
a
good
deal
then
oh
no
i
have
never
been
out
of
meccania
thank
god
what
makes
you
think
there
is
nothing
like
it
then
in
any
other
country
i
asked
oh
the
wide
streets
the
buildings
the
gardens
the
monuments
the
uniforms
the
music
everything
it
is
when
you
have
seen
the
great
monument
the
statue
of
prince
mechow
there
is
nothing
like
it
anywhere
you
will
see
and
you
must
not
miss
the
memorial
museum
of
prince
mechow
i
tell
you
it
is
a
privilege
to
live
in
mecco
but
i
must
not
gossip
he
said
as
if
half
ashamed
i
have
many
duties
and
off
he
went
towards
the
end
of
the
journey
which
lasted
a
little
over
two
hours
he
looked
in
again
and
said
you
must
not
leave
mecco
until
you
have
seen
the
great
festival
on
prince
birthday
i
promised
to
remember
it
as
we
drew
near
to
mecco
the
train
slackened
speed
and
i
could
see
but
only
for
a
minute
or
two
a
great
city
spread
over
a
wide
plain
there
were
domes
and
towers
steeples
and
pinnacles
huge
masses
of
masonry
suggesting
great
public
buildings
then
miles
of
houses
and
gardens
and
in
the
far
distance
warehouses
and
factories
but
no
smoke
we
plunged
into
a
tunnel
and
then
emerged
suddenly
into
a
blaze
of
light
the
train
glided
along
the
platform
and
as
i
stepped
out
i
could
not
help
looking
round
in
admiration
at
the
truly
magnificent
arches
and
lofty
dome
of
the
great
central
station
of
mecco
the
roof
seemed
to
be
made
of
some
wonderful
prismatic
glass
that
radiated
light
everywhere
the
ground
was
covered
with
immense
tiles
in
coloured
patterns
all
as
clean
as
if
they
had
been
washed
and
scrubbed
that
very
hour
not
a
speck
of
dirt
or
smoke
was
to
be
seen
although
hundreds
of
people
were
in
the
station
there
was
no
bustle
no
one
sauntered
about
every
one
seemed
to
go
just
where
he
had
business
there
was
no
scrambling
for
luggage
or
for
cabs
no
one
was
allowed
to
take
luggage
with
him
unless
it
could
be
carried
in
one
hand
the
rest
was
all
registered
and
sent
to
its
destination
by
the
railway
servants
only
persons
of
the
third
or
a
higher
class
were
allowed
to
use
and
these
were
all
ordered
beforehand
the
impression
of
orderliness
was
almost
uncanny
as
i
reached
the
end
of
the
platform
i
was
touched
on
the
shoulder
by
a
man
in
the
green
uniform
of
the
fourth
class
decorated
with
several
stripes
and
badges
you
are
national
councillor
ming
he
said
and
i
am
conductor
of
foreign
observers
prigge
he
seemed
to
be
in
very
good
spirits
but
this
made
him
rather
offensive
than
amiable
he
treated
me
as
if
i
were
a
sort
of
prisoner
or
at
any
rate
as
if
i
were
a
very
juvenile
pupil
he
said
that
as
my
bags
had
gone
to
the
hotel
for
foreign
observers
we
need
not
go
there
first
but
could
proceed
straight
to
the
police
office
this
was
not
far
from
the
station
and
was
a
large
building
almost
like
a
fortress
in
front
viewed
from
the
other
side
as
i
afterwards
saw
it
was
more
like
a
set
of
offices
with
large
windows
first
of
all
i
was
taken
to
the
police
doctor
who
spent
nearly
two
hours
upon
a
minute
medical
examination
of
me
the
object
of
this
could
not
have
been
to
make
sure
that
i
was
for
i
had
been
seen
the
day
before
by
the
police
doctor
at
bridgetown
it
could
not
have
been
for
the
purpose
of
identification
seeing
that
the
authorities
had
obtained
all
the
and
everything
else
they
required
on
my
first
arrival
i
could
only
conclude
that
it
was
for
the
purpose
of
scientific
research
i
judged
from
the
remarks
made
by
doctor
pincher
in
the
course
of
his
investigations
that
he
was
an
expert
anthropologist
he
took
samples
of
my
hair
not
only
from
my
head
but
from
various
parts
of
my
body
he
took
a
sample
of
my
blood
and
of
the
perspiration
from
several
different
glands
he
even
removed
a
small
particle
of
skin
without
any
pain
he
tested
my
eyesight
hearing
and
smell
my
muscular
powers
and
all
sorts
of
reactions
to
various
stimuli
he
informed
me
that
i
should
require
a
pair
of
spectacles
i
said
i
did
not
think
it
was
worth
while
as
i
had
never
yet
experienced
any
discomfort
he
replied
that
that
made
no
difference
and
proceeded
to
write
out
a
prescription
which
he
told
me
to
take
to
a
certain
office
where
in
a
few
days
i
should
be
supplied
with
the
necessary
glasses
he
then
took
a
cast
of
my
mouth
and
of
my
ears
and
measured
me
in
twenty
different
places
finally
he
gave
me
a
drink
of
what
appeared
to
be
water
but
which
made
me
unconscious
for
several
minutes
what
he
did
during
those
few
minutes
i
do
not
know
and
he
did
not
deign
to
inform
me
as
i
left
him
he
smiled
i
suppose
he
thought
he
was
being
amiable
and
said
we
do
not
have
the
pleasure
of
seeing
a
chinaman
here
every
day
i
was
then
taken
to
the
office
of
chief
inspector
of
foreigners
pryer
he
looked
at
me
asked
a
few
trivial
questions
and
handed
me
over
to
a
subordinate
lower
inspector
of
foreigners
bulley
this
gentleman
sat
at
a
desk
and
after
noting
the
time
and
my
name
on
a
sort
of
tablet
took
out
a
yellow
form
foolscap
size
upon
which
he
proceeded
to
make
notes
of
my
answers
to
his
questions
he
put
me
through
a
catechism
as
to
what
i
had
seen
in
bridgetown
which
of
the
local
institutions
had
i
visited
which
of
the
national
which
of
the
local
and
national
what
had
i
learnt
of
the
industrial
and
social
economy
of
bridgetown
what
had
i
learnt
of
the
cultural
institutions
had
i
made
notes
of
my
daily
tours
and
could
i
produce
them
luckily
all
my
notes
were
in
a
language
that
inspector
bulley
could
not
read
he
then
proceeded
to
discuss
plans
for
my
tours
of
observation
in
mecco
in
the
first
place
how
long
did
i
propose
to
stay
i
did
not
know
what
did
the
length
of
my
stay
depend
upon
i
said
it
would
largely
depend
upon
my
ability
to
stand
the
strain
of
it
i
thought
this
would
perhaps
annoy
him
but
on
the
contrary
it
pleased
him
immensely
good
he
said
you
are
here
to
study
the
institutions
of
mecco
and
you
will
stay
as
long
as
you
have
the
strength
to
carry
out
your
task
that
was
not
what
i
meant
but
i
let
it
pass
i
think
you
had
better
select
the
preliminary
six
months
tour
of
observation
he
said
after
that
you
can
begin
the
study
of
any
special
branch
for
which
you
are
qualified
and
for
which
you
have
an
inclination
possibly
industry
possibly
art
possibly
sociology
possibly
education
we
can
decide
that
at
the
end
of
your
preliminary
period
you
will
have
for
your
guide
for
the
first
few
weeks
lower
conductor
prigge
as
however
he
has
just
been
promoted
to
a
higher
rank
in
the
police
service
he
will
not
be
available
after
the
first
few
weeks
but
i
will
arrange
for
a
suitable
successor
he
then
presented
me
with
several
documents
this
he
said
handing
me
a
thick
notebook
of
some
two
hundred
pages
is
the
preliminary
diary
in
which
you
make
your
notes
in
whatever
form
you
like
there
are
four
pages
for
each
day
this
is
the
formal
diary
for
the
time
department
to
be
carefully
entered
up
each
week
and
posted
before
sunday
morning
these
are
the
sheets
of
instructions
specially
drawn
up
for
foreign
observers
in
mecco
you
will
notice
they
are
all
marked
no
and
numbered
consecutively
and
this
handing
me
a
thin
metal
plate
about
half
the
size
of
a
postcard
is
your
identification
ticket
it
was
now
the
middle
of
the
afternoon
i
had
had
no
luncheon
so
when
prigge
came
to
take
me
off
to
the
hotel
i
proposed
that
we
should
have
some
tea
he
demurred
a
little
as
he
did
not
drink
tea
but
he
consented
to
have
some
coffee
and
a
cigar
in
the
if
i
would
drink
my
tea
there
so
we
went
on
talking
over
our
tea
and
coffee
and
this
is
a
specimen
of
the
conversation
you
will
understand
said
prigge
that
everything
depends
upon
your
own
energy
and
intelligence
if
you
apply
yourself
thoroughly
to
the
work
before
you
you
will
learn
more
in
a
fortnight
under
my
guidance
than
in
a
whole
year
in
luniland
i
have
had
a
long
experience
in
conducting
foreigners
most
of
them
have
no
idea
how
to
observe
especially
those
who
come
from
luniland
they
want
to
roam
about
without
any
system
or
method
at
all
they
want
to
see
an
art
gallery
one
day
and
a
manufactory
the
next
or
even
on
the
same
day
then
they
want
to
see
a
natural
history
museum
on
the
same
day
as
an
archæological
museum
they
will
fly
from
pottery
to
pictures
and
from
geology
to
botany
why
i
was
taking
one
of
them
through
our
great
museum
illustrative
of
the
stages
of
culture
which
is
arranged
in
twenty
successive
centuries
and
when
we
had
reached
the
sixteenth
he
actually
wanted
to
turn
back
to
look
at
something
in
the
twelfth
i
think
it
will
be
a
good
thing
i
said
if
i
ask
you
questions
as
we
go
along
about
matters
that
strike
me
with
all
your
knowledge
you
will
be
able
to
tell
me
many
things
outside
the
regular
routine
your
proposal
implies
he
replied
that
i
shall
not
give
you
the
appropriate
information
in
proper
order
if
you
will
follow
my
directions
you
will
learn
more
than
by
any
amount
of
aimless
and
desultory
questioning
i
have
studied
the
principles
of
pedagogy
as
applied
to
conducting
foreign
observers
and
i
shall
accommodate
the
presentation
of
new
matter
to
the
existing
content
of
your
mind
in
so
far
as
your
mind
has
any
definite
content
you
will
not
be
precluded
from
asking
questions
but
whether
i
shall
answer
them
will
depend
upon
their
relevance
to
the
subject
in
hand
before
we
parted
he
gave
me
some
general
instructions
for
the
first
week
he
said
you
will
not
be
permitted
to
converse
with
other
foreigners
staying
in
the
hotel
tonight
you
will
be
free
to
attend
to
your
private
affairs
and
prepare
for
tomorrow
we
shall
begin
by
a
survey
of
the
general
geography
of
the
city
and
in
the
evening
you
will
have
permission
to
attend
one
of
the
lectures
specially
given
to
foreign
observers
by
professor
on
prince
mechow
the
of
the
meccanian
state
professor
is
the
professor
of
historical
culture
in
mecco
and
this
course
of
lectures
is
given
periodically
so
that
foreigners
may
have
no
excuse
for
being
ignorant
of
the
true
history
of
the
rise
and
development
of
meccanian
culture
so
i
spent
the
evening
in
writing
letters
looking
up
my
and
filling
up
my
diary
for
this
day
interviews
with
officials
accounted
for
at
least
five
hours
next
morning
at
nine
conductor
prigge
turned
up
looking
more
perky
than
ever
he
had
all
the
airs
of
a
professor
a
police
officer
and
a
drill
sergeant
rolled
into
one
our
first
business
will
be
to
study
the
map
he
said
to
that
we
will
give
one
and
a
half
hours
after
that
we
will
ascend
the
tower
in
the
meteorological
department
and
take
a
view
of
the
city
in
the
concrete
in
the
afternoon
we
will
go
by
in
three
concentric
circles
and
in
the
evening
you
will
attend
professor
lecture
we
began
with
the
maps
i
remembered
something
of
the
maps
of
the
old
city
from
my
geographical
studies
at
home
and
i
remarked
on
the
great
changes
for
hardly
a
vestige
of
the
old
city
seemed
to
remain
prigge
appeared
rather
pleased
that
is
an
instance
of
the
superiority
of
our
culture
he
remarked
all
the
other
capitals
of
europe
he
said
still
preserve
the
plan
of
the
mediæval
city
in
the
central
parts
at
least
and
the
central
parts
are
the
most
important
the
authorities
profess
to
have
preserved
them
because
of
their
historical
interest
in
reality
it
is
because
they
do
not
know
how
to
remodel
them
against
human
stupidity
the
very
gods
fight
in
vain
but
to
intelligence
all
things
are
possible
any
dolt
can
plan
a
new
city
but
we
are
the
only
people
in
europe
who
know
how
to
remodel
our
old
cities
now
you
will
notice
he
went
on
that
we
have
preserved
the
old
royal
palace
and
several
other
important
buildings
they
do
not
interfere
with
the
general
plan
the
large
central
ring
over
a
square
mile
in
extent
is
occupied
by
government
buildings
and
although
there
is
a
larger
number
than
in
all
the
european
capitals
put
together
they
are
not
crowded
the
square
of
prince
mechow
where
the
great
statue
stands
is
the
largest
in
europe
the
ring
outside
that
is
occupied
by
cultural
institutions
museums
art
galleries
libraries
the
university
the
zoological
gardens
the
botanical
gardens
and
so
forth
next
comes
a
very
much
larger
ring
occupied
almost
entirely
by
the
residential
quarters
of
the
six
social
classes
in
mecco
itself
there
are
no
members
of
the
seventh
class
the
whole
presents
a
superficial
resemblance
to
a
great
wheel
where
then
is
the
manufacturing
quarter
and
the
business
quarter
now
where
would
you
expect
he
asked
as
if
to
show
off
his
own
cunning
i
saw
a
number
of
factories
in
the
distance
i
said
yes
he
answered
the
manufacturing
quarter
lies
outside
the
ring
and
forms
a
sort
of
town
by
itself
and
the
business
quarter
that
must
be
centrally
placed
i
said
not
necessarily
if
you
draw
a
line
from
the
centre
of
mecco
to
the
industrial
quarter
you
will
find
the
commercial
quarter
occupying
a
long
rectangle
between
the
second
ring
and
the
outer
edge
of
the
exterior
circle
the
commercial
quarter
thus
cuts
the
residential
ring
on
one
side
the
residential
quarters
of
the
sixth
and
fifth
classes
lie
on
each
side
of
the
commercial
quarter
and
are
therefore
nearest
to
the
industrial
quarter
illustration
you
will
observe
he
continued
that
we
have
no
seventh
class
in
mecco
itself
we
are
an
imperial
city
and
even
the
servants
of
the
belong
to
the
sixth
class
it
is
the
greatest
privilege
of
a
meccanian
citizen
to
live
in
mecco
and
all
the
citizens
of
mecco
are
so
to
speak
selected
none
but
loyal
upholders
of
the
national
and
imperial
ideal
are
allowed
the
privilege
of
living
here
it
would
not
be
right
there
again
it
is
our
superior
national
culture
that
has
enabled
us
to
realise
such
a
plan
what
government
in
europe
could
drive
out
of
its
capital
all
citizens
who
did
not
actively
support
the
state
it
is
indeed
a
wonderful
thing
i
said
but
what
becomes
of
such
disloyal
citizens
when
they
are
shall
i
say
expelled
or
exiled
ah
you
must
not
believe
that
have
had
to
indulge
in
any
policy
of
expulsion
you
will
not
find
any
disloyal
element
anywhere
in
meccania
a
few
individuals
you
might
find
but
most
of
them
are
in
lunatic
asylums
but
surely
i
said
i
have
read
in
the
histories
of
meccania
that
formerly
there
were
large
numbers
of
people
among
the
working
classes
chiefly
who
were
well
rather
revolutionary
in
their
ideas
and
whom
i
should
not
have
expected
to
see
becoming
loyal
to
such
a
state
as
the
meccania
of
he
smiled
a
very
superior
smile
really
he
said
the
ignorance
of
our
country
which
foreigners
betray
is
extraordinary
disloyalty
to
the
state
is
found
in
every
country
meccania
we
have
got
rid
of
it
long
ago
by
the
simple
process
of
education
if
we
find
an
odd
individual
who
displays
disloyal
sentiments
we
regard
him
as
a
lunatic
and
treat
him
accordingly
how
i
asked
we
put
him
in
a
lunatic
asylum
and
your
lunatic
asylums
have
you
enough
for
the
purpose
i
ventured
to
ask
conductor
prigge
luckily
did
not
see
the
point
in
most
cases
he
said
the
threat
is
sufficient
we
require
very
few
lunatic
asylums
just
as
we
require
few
prisons
but
we
are
wandering
from
the
subject
he
remarked
and
he
drew
out
a
map
of
the
residential
quarters
coloured
in
white
red
yellow
green
chocolate
and
grey
the
colours
of
the
classes
omitting
the
seventh
i
noticed
that
the
parts
coloured
white
red
and
yellow
covered
about
half
the
circle
i
was
going
to
put
some
questions
to
prigge
as
to
the
relative
numbers
of
the
classes
when
he
said
i
do
not
think
you
have
yet
grasped
our
sevenfold
classification
of
the
citizenship
of
meccania
somewhat
imperfectly
i
am
afraid
i
replied
then
you
have
not
grasped
it
he
said
you
can
not
be
said
to
grasp
it
if
you
are
not
perfectly
clear
about
it
i
will
explain
attend
begin
with
the
lowest
that
is
the
logical
order
the
seventh
class
consists
of
persons
of
the
lowest
order
of
intelligence
who
can
not
profit
by
the
ordinary
instruction
in
the
schools
beyond
a
very
moderate
degree
they
are
not
very
numerous
from
the
age
of
ten
they
are
taught
to
do
simple
work
of
a
purely
mechanical
kind
and
when
strong
enough
are
set
to
do
the
most
menial
work
which
requires
little
intelligence
a
few
other
persons
who
have
failed
in
life
through
their
own
fault
are
relegated
to
this
class
as
a
punishment
the
sixth
class
corresponds
to
the
unskilled
labouring
class
of
most
foreign
countries
they
are
recruited
from
the
children
who
at
twelve
years
of
age
show
only
average
ability
they
are
then
trained
to
do
either
simple
manual
work
or
to
act
as
servants
in
families
below
the
second
class
the
fifth
is
the
largest
class
it
is
larger
than
the
sixth
and
seventh
together
we
require
a
very
large
number
of
skilled
artisans
and
clerks
in
a
subordinate
capacity
consequently
we
train
all
who
are
capable
of
profiting
by
a
combination
of
theoretical
and
practical
instruction
until
the
age
of
fifteen
and
even
for
some
years
after
that
in
industrial
schools
where
they
study
the
practical
aspects
of
mathematics
and
science
consequently
they
are
by
far
the
most
skilled
artisan
class
in
the
world
we
have
no
trouble
in
inducing
them
to
apply
themselves
to
study
for
any
member
of
the
fifth
class
who
failed
to
profit
by
the
system
of
instruction
provided
for
him
would
soon
find
himself
in
the
sixth
class
which
enjoys
much
less
in
the
shape
of
privileges
and
material
than
the
fifth
the
fourth
class
includes
most
of
the
bourgeoisie
the
bulk
of
the
officials
and
clergy
as
well
as
the
small
group
of
professional
people
who
are
not
officials
in
detail
it
comprises
tradesmen
managers
of
businesses
and
foremen
in
responsible
positions
all
these
are
in
the
industrial
and
commercial
world
then
come
all
civil
servants
below
the
first
grade
all
officers
in
the
army
and
navy
all
the
clergy
below
the
rank
of
bishops
the
professional
people
i
referred
to
are
a
few
who
have
not
been
absorbed
in
the
official
class
we
have
no
journalists
in
meccania
no
doctors
who
are
not
in
the
state
service
and
no
lawyers
who
are
not
officials
then
who
these
professional
people
i
interrupted
they
are
merely
a
handful
of
people
mostly
possessed
of
small
private
means
who
write
books
that
are
never
published
or
cultivate
art
or
music
or
science
they
are
not
good
enough
to
be
taken
into
the
state
service
and
they
are
gradually
disappearing
altogether
the
third
class
he
resumed
corresponds
partly
to
the
higher
bourgeoisie
of
other
countries
but
it
also
includes
several
more
important
elements
it
comprises
the
richer
merchants
and
manufacturers
who
must
possess
an
income
of
at
least
a
year
the
first
class
of
civil
servants
the
higher
clergy
those
university
professors
who
have
held
their
posts
for
ten
years
and
are
approved
by
the
ministry
of
culture
landed
proprietors
who
are
district
councillors
and
magistrates
and
all
with
an
income
of
a
year
the
second
class
is
the
military
class
it
includes
all
officers
who
must
be
of
noble
birth
a
few
of
the
highest
civil
servants
are
in
this
class
but
they
must
have
previously
served
as
officers
in
the
army
or
navy
the
first
class
is
partly
military
and
partly
civil
but
except
members
of
royal
or
ducal
families
all
in
the
first
class
have
previously
passed
through
the
second
ambassadors
are
in
the
first
class
but
they
have
all
served
for
a
period
as
officers
in
the
army
even
the
head
of
a
department
of
state
is
not
admitted
to
the
first
class
unless
he
has
previously
been
in
the
second
class
lastly
the
relative
numbers
of
the
various
classes
are
as
follows
out
of
a
total
population
of
only
about
are
in
the
first
class
are
in
the
second
are
in
the
third
are
in
the
fourth
are
in
the
fifth
are
in
the
sixth
and
the
rest
nearly
in
the
seventh
class
all
women
take
the
rank
of
their
fathers
or
their
husbands
whichever
is
the
higher
children
take
the
rank
of
their
parents
until
their
sixteenth
year
is
that
clear
quite
clear
i
replied
except
in
one
particular
what
is
that
i
take
it
that
some
at
any
rate
pass
from
one
class
to
another
by
what
means
for
example
does
a
person
who
starts
life
let
us
say
in
the
fourth
class
obtain
admission
to
the
third
we
must
take
some
particular
category
a
business
man
a
small
manufacturer
who
is
highly
successful
perhaps
makes
some
valuable
discovery
which
enriches
him
how
does
he
obtain
admission
to
the
third
class
he
must
have
an
income
of
at
least
a
year
and
he
must
have
performed
some
service
to
the
state
answered
prigge
promptly
and
a
civil
servant
if
he
is
promoted
to
the
first
grade
he
also
is
admitted
to
the
third
class
but
this
does
not
frequently
happen
then
on
the
whole
the
children
of
those
in
each
class
respectively
remain
in
the
class
in
which
they
are
born
that
is
so
as
a
rule
the
percentage
has
been
worked
out
carefully
by
the
statistical
branch
of
the
sociological
department
about
per
cent
of
the
seventh
class
enter
the
sixth
about
per
cent
of
the
sixth
enter
the
fifth
about
per
cent
of
the
fifth
enter
the
fourth
about
per
cent
of
the
fourth
enter
the
third
no
one
strictly
speaking
enters
the
second
from
the
third
but
as
many
of
the
men
of
the
second
class
marry
women
in
the
third
class
which
is
the
rich
class
the
sons
may
enter
the
second
class
if
they
are
suitable
as
officers
in
the
army
also
a
number
of
the
women
of
the
second
class
marry
men
in
the
third
class
and
their
sons
also
may
enter
the
army
it
is
a
wonderful
system
i
ventured
to
observe
it
is
simplicity
itself
said
prigge
yet
no
other
nation
has
had
the
intelligence
to
discover
it
nor
even
to
copy
it
as
a
matter
of
fact
it
is
the
only
logical
and
scientific
classification
of
society
it
puts
everybody
in
his
proper
place
after
this
conversation
or
rather
this
discourse
we
walked
out
to
ascend
the
tower
but
on
the
way
we
had
to
cross
the
great
square
of
prince
mechow
and
there
for
the
first
time
i
saw
the
great
monument
about
which
i
had
heard
so
much
i
had
expected
something
extraordinary
but
i
was
not
prepared
for
the
actual
thing
it
was
as
high
as
a
church
steeple
at
the
base
was
a
huge
shapeless
mass
of
basalt
above
this
rose
a
square
granite
block
twenty
feet
high
covered
with
sculptures
representing
in
allegorical
form
the
reconstruction
of
the
meccanian
at
the
four
corners
were
four
figures
representing
arms
intellect
culture
and
power
above
this
again
towered
a
great
pedestal
a
hundred
feet
high
and
forty
feet
in
diameter
on
the
top
stood
the
colossal
statue
of
prince
mechow
a
gigantic
of
a
man
in
the
uniform
of
the
first
class
his
breast
covered
with
decorations
a
sword
in
one
hand
and
a
mace
or
some
symbolical
weapon
in
the
other
the
impression
of
brute
force
which
it
conveyed
was
terrific
every
person
in
the
square
as
he
came
within
sight
of
it
took
off
his
hat
those
in
military
dress
saluted
it
and
pronounced
the
words
long
live
meccania
and
god
bless
prince
mechow
my
first
feeling
on
seeing
it
was
one
of
intense
disgust
at
the
barbarity
of
the
thing
and
i
was
just
going
to
make
some
satirical
remark
when
i
caught
sight
of
prigge
face
it
wore
an
expression
of
absolute
ecstasy
and
the
look
of
fierce
disdain
with
which
he
said
uncover
was
startling
he
added
something
which
sounded
like
mongolian
monkey
but
in
the
excitement
of
the
moment
i
was
not
quite
sure
what
he
said
i
tried
to
pacify
him
by
saying
in
as
innocent
a
tone
as
i
could
assume
it
is
indeed
the
most
remarkable
statue
i
have
ever
seen
it
is
the
most
perfect
embodiment
of
meccanian
culture
no
other
country
could
produce
such
a
work
he
replied
solemnly
i
am
inclined
to
agree
i
said
who
was
the
artist
who
conceived
and
executed
a
monument
of
such
wonderful
proportions
the
artist
what
other
nation
could
produce
a
man
who
united
such
gifts
with
such
a
true
meccanian
spirit
he
desired
that
his
name
should
never
be
spoken
when
the
work
was
completed
after
ten
years
he
gave
up
his
life
and
begged
to
be
allowed
to
be
buried
underneath
the
rock
with
all
the
tools
that
had
been
used
in
the
execution
of
the
statue
his
dying
request
was
respected
his
name
is
never
uttered
but
every
child
in
meccania
knows
it
and
every
citizen
in
meccania
comes
once
every
ten
years
to
salute
the
statue
of
prince
mechow
and
do
honour
to
the
who
lies
buried
beneath
i
shall
never
forget
the
story
i
said
and
we
walked
on
to
the
tower
on
the
way
i
noticed
that
every
person
in
the
street
saluted
every
other
person
of
higher
rank
than
himself
i
have
since
learnt
that
there
are
six
different
forms
of
salute
one
for
each
class
above
the
seventh
and
that
it
is
a
point
of
strict
etiquette
to
give
the
right
salute
a
salute
appropriate
to
the
fourth
class
given
to
a
member
of
the
third
is
an
insult
and
the
wrong
salute
given
to
a
member
of
the
second
military
class
may
cost
the
offender
his
life
we
ascended
the
tower
the
sight
was
magnificent
from
where
we
stood
the
details
of
the
architecture
could
not
be
seen
nor
even
the
style
of
the
buildings
but
the
general
impression
produced
by
such
a
vast
assemblage
of
massive
edifices
was
one
of
grandeur
and
power
while
the
bright
sunlight
and
the
absence
of
smoke
and
dirt
gave
the
whole
city
the
appearance
of
having
suddenly
sprung
up
in
a
night
like
aladdin
palace
to
the
west
in
a
great
semicircle
the
quarters
of
the
first
three
classes
presented
a
spectacle
such
as
i
have
not
seen
in
any
capital
every
house
was
a
mansion
or
a
villa
surrounded
by
a
pleasant
garden
here
and
there
one
saw
large
stretches
of
beautiful
park
to
the
east
the
houses
were
clustered
more
thickly
together
but
even
on
this
side
there
was
an
air
of
orderliness
and
comfort
although
certainly
not
of
luxury
which
contrasted
favourably
with
the
populous
districts
of
the
towns
i
had
seen
in
other
countries
about
five
miles
away
we
could
see
distinctly
with
the
aid
of
the
glasses
the
manufactories
and
workshops
and
warehouses
of
the
industrial
town
that
served
the
needs
of
the
whole
capital
conductor
prigge
seemed
duly
satisfied
with
the
impression
made
on
me
here
he
said
you
are
at
the
centre
of
the
civilisation
of
the
modern
world
here
are
three
million
thoroughly
efficient
meccanians
every
one
in
his
proper
place
every
one
fulfilling
his
appointed
duty
think
of
the
disorder
the
squalor
the
conflict
of
aims
the
absence
of
ideals
represented
by
a
city
like
lunopolis
or
prisa
and
look
on
this
picture
we
descended
and
returned
to
the
hotel
after
luncheon
we
proceeded
with
our
tour
of
the
tramway
system
by
this
means
i
got
a
good
view
of
the
exterior
appearance
of
the
houses
of
the
various
classes
it
confirmed
the
impression
i
had
gained
from
the
tower
except
in
one
respect
the
houses
of
the
looked
as
if
they
had
all
been
designed
by
the
same
school
of
architects
and
except
that
they
differed
in
size
they
might
have
been
turned
out
by
machinery
the
houses
of
the
rest
of
the
population
were
to
an
even
greater
degree
the
dwellings
of
the
sixth
class
are
really
blocks
of
small
flats
of
a
standard
size
those
of
the
fifth
class
are
similar
except
that
the
rooms
are
a
little
larger
and
there
are
more
of
them
one
curious
fact
came
to
light
in
the
course
of
conductor
prigge
explanation
of
the
housing
system
it
seems
that
the
births
department
determines
the
number
of
children
each
family
is
expected
to
have
within
a
given
period
of
years
and
the
houses
are
distributed
accordingly
thus
a
family
in
the
fifth
class
which
is
due
to
have
let
us
say
four
children
within
the
next
seven
years
is
assigned
a
flat
of
five
rooms
then
if
the
same
family
is
due
to
have
two
more
children
within
the
next
five
years
they
move
into
a
house
with
seven
rooms
persons
in
the
first
grade
of
the
fifth
class
are
allowed
to
take
a
flat
with
more
rooms
on
payment
of
a
special
rate
or
tax
apparently
there
is
very
little
choice
of
houses
as
all
the
houses
of
a
certain
grade
are
practically
alike
if
a
tenant
wishes
to
move
to
another
street
he
has
to
furnish
valid
reasons
and
it
is
not
easy
to
furnish
reasons
satisfactory
to
the
authorities
besides
the
number
of
houses
or
flats
is
very
closely
proportioned
to
the
number
of
tenants
and
there
are
never
many
vacant
houses
the
members
of
the
third
and
higher
classes
own
their
own
houses
and
can
therefore
change
their
residences
by
purchasing
or
exchanging
by
special
privilege
members
of
the
fourth
class
can
obtain
permission
to
buy
their
houses
but
as
these
are
mostly
flats
they
are
usually
rented
from
the
municipality
chapter
iv
professor
lecture
following
conductor
prigge
instructions
i
presented
myself
at
six
in
the
evening
at
the
entrance
to
the
great
university
of
mecco
it
was
the
first
time
i
had
been
out
without
my
but
as
everybody
else
was
dressed
in
the
meccanian
costume
whilst
i
was
wearing
the
clothes
i
had
been
accustomed
to
wear
in
luniland
and
francaria
there
was
little
risk
of
my
going
astray
a
porter
darted
out
of
a
box
in
the
entrance
hall
and
directed
me
to
room
where
the
professor
of
historical
culture
was
to
deliver
his
monthly
lecture
to
foreign
observers
i
found
about
a
dozen
foreign
observers
of
various
nationalities
waiting
in
the
small
and
presently
a
few
more
arrived
some
were
scandinavians
some
south
americans
a
few
i
thought
were
turks
several
were
from
some
part
of
india
at
precisely
the
professor
came
in
he
wore
a
brilliant
yellow
uniform
of
the
third
class
with
green
facings
and
buttons
and
a
number
of
little
ribbons
indicating
i
suppose
various
services
rendered
to
the
cause
of
meccanian
culture
apart
from
his
dress
he
resembled
the
caricatures
of
meccanian
professors
in
our
comic
prints
his
head
was
bald
on
the
top
and
at
the
front
but
at
the
sides
great
tufts
of
white
hair
protruded
his
grey
beard
was
of
ample
proportions
his
coarse
wizened
face
and
staring
eyes
covered
by
a
pair
of
huge
spectacles
gave
him
the
appearance
of
a
as
he
sat
behind
a
high
his
voice
was
tough
and
leathery
at
the
end
of
three
hours
it
sounded
as
fresh
and
as
harsh
as
in
the
opening
sentences
i
can
not
reproduce
the
whole
lecture
if
i
did
it
would
almost
fill
a
book
by
itself
i
can
only
hope
to
give
a
rough
idea
of
it
by
paraphrasing
some
of
the
most
salient
passages
he
began
by
saying
that
to
accommodate
himself
to
the
culture
of
his
foreign
auditors
he
would
endeavour
to
present
his
subject
in
the
simplest
possible
form
which
was
the
narrative
and
would
sketch
the
biography
of
the
great
of
the
meccanian
state
the
true
architect
of
the
first
in
the
world
the
greatest
political
creative
genius
that
had
ever
stepped
upon
the
world
stage
prince
mechow
we
had
all
seen
his
memorial
statue
a
unique
monument
to
a
unique
individual
and
no
doubt
it
had
made
an
impression
upon
our
imagination
but
it
was
impossible
for
any
work
of
art
however
great
and
here
he
paid
a
tribute
to
the
who
built
the
monument
to
convey
more
than
a
symbolical
suggestion
of
the
magnificence
of
prince
mechow
truly
meccanian
personality
for
that
we
must
look
around
at
the
itself
prince
mechow
he
said
was
historically
the
culminating
figure
of
the
national
development
of
meccania
compared
with
many
countries
in
europe
meccania
could
not
boast
a
long
history
some
historians
sought
a
false
glory
for
meccania
by
tracing
its
greatness
back
to
the
roman
empire
of
the
middle
ages
but
true
meccanian
history
went
back
only
a
few
hundred
years
in
fact
it
was
not
until
the
eighteenth
century
that
the
meccanian
state
in
the
proper
sense
of
the
word
began
and
only
in
the
nineteenth
century
did
it
take
its
place
among
the
powers
of
the
modern
world
in
the
nineteenth
century
the
meccanian
state
was
saved
by
the
genius
and
will
of
one
great
man
the
worthy
predecessor
of
prince
mechow
his
prince
bludiron
from
a
scientific
or
philosophical
point
of
view
it
was
difficult
to
say
whether
prince
bludiron
had
not
contributed
as
much
to
the
greatness
of
meccania
as
prince
mechow
for
it
was
he
undoubtedly
who
laid
the
foundations
upon
which
the
final
structure
rested
the
work
of
prince
bludiron
was
very
different
from
but
also
similar
in
spirit
to
the
work
of
prince
mechow
his
task
had
been
to
rescue
the
young
and
inexperienced
state
from
the
perils
and
distractions
of
the
false
ideals
of
liberty
and
democracy
to
secure
the
power
of
the
state
over
all
sections
and
classes
to
create
the
proud
and
confident
meccanian
spirit
and
to
set
the
nation
on
the
right
path
the
task
of
prince
mechow
was
to
erect
the
on
the
foundations
laid
by
prince
bludiron
in
other
words
to
organise
the
energies
of
the
whole
nation
to
one
supreme
end
to
train
and
direct
the
powers
of
every
individual
so
as
to
produce
one
mind
and
one
will
turning
to
the
work
of
prince
bludiron
the
professor
said
that
when
he
began
his
work
meccania
was
distracted
by
false
and
conflicting
ideals
of
foreign
origin
revolution
was
in
the
air
people
were
ready
to
drive
out
their
lawful
rulers
popular
government
was
demanded
parliaments
were
being
set
up
it
was
the
saddest
page
in
meccanian
history
had
these
anarchic
forces
triumphed
meccania
would
have
sunk
to
the
level
of
other
nations
and
the
would
never
have
arisen
it
was
the
greatest
testimony
to
the
intellectual
genius
and
moral
power
of
prince
bludiron
that
after
forty
years
of
strenuous
work
the
whole
outlook
for
meccania
was
completely
changed
the
false
ideal
of
individual
liberty
was
dead
and
buried
popular
government
was
a
discredited
superstition
the
military
aristocracy
were
secure
in
their
rightful
position
the
efficiency
of
the
government
was
demonstrated
in
every
direction
and
not
least
on
the
field
of
battle
wars
had
been
won
with
a
rapidity
unprecedented
in
any
age
prince
bludiron
success
was
so
complete
that
it
was
almost
impossible
for
us
now
to
realise
how
great
his
difficulties
had
been
so
strong
were
the
forces
of
democracy
that
even
he
had
to
temporise
and
set
up
a
parliament
he
even
granted
manhood
suffrage
then
explained
how
prince
bludiron
outwitted
the
disloyal
elements
among
the
people
by
securing
the
reality
of
power
to
the
organised
centralised
state
whilst
leaving
the
semblance
of
control
to
the
representative
bodies
he
quoted
a
foreign
observer
at
the
end
of
prince
bludiron
career
who
declared
that
the
institutions
set
up
by
him
enabled
the
state
to
wield
the
maximum
of
power
with
the
minimum
of
opposition
strangely
enough
said
the
professor
the
very
movement
that
threatened
to
undo
all
his
work
was
in
reality
of
the
greatest
service
he
referred
to
the
movement
of
meccanian
socialism
or
social
democracy
which
owed
its
peculiar
character
to
a
certain
demagogue
named
spotts
the
career
and
influence
of
spotts
was
for
a
time
almost
as
remarkable
as
prince
bludiron
spotts
persuaded
his
followers
that
the
economic
tendencies
of
modern
life
must
inevitably
create
the
socialist
state
the
people
need
only
wait
until
these
tendencies
had
worked
themselves
out
and
then
seize
the
power
of
the
state
which
would
drop
into
their
hands
like
ripe
fruit
he
saw
in
the
existing
state
nothing
but
organised
capitalism
consequently
he
encouraged
his
followers
to
take
no
part
in
the
actual
government
but
to
maintain
themselves
in
permanent
opposition
until
the
inevitable
revolution
came
about
when
they
were
to
assume
the
whole
control
spottsian
socialism
became
the
universal
doctrine
of
the
meccanian
proletariat
of
those
days
they
talked
about
the
economic
interpretation
of
history
about
economic
forces
about
economic
revolutions
mixed
with
vague
notions
of
liberty
and
equality
but
in
reality
they
cared
not
a
straw
for
liberty
what
they
sought
was
power
yet
by
standing
in
permanent
opposition
to
every
other
element
in
the
state
they
played
into
prince
bludiron
hands
whilst
they
waited
for
the
inevitable
revolution
he
had
accustomed
the
people
to
prosperity
and
had
raised
the
prestige
of
the
state
at
home
and
abroad
he
had
gained
the
support
of
all
the
strongest
elements
in
society
had
trained
an
efficient
bureaucracy
and
an
efficient
military
aristocracy
and
yet
at
his
death
the
followers
of
spotts
went
on
waiting
for
the
economic
revolution
the
professor
then
dealt
briefly
with
what
he
said
was
the
most
difficult
period
for
a
meccanian
historian
the
period
between
the
death
of
prince
bludiron
and
the
rise
of
the
still
greater
statesman
prince
mechow
in
that
interval
no
great
leader
arose
but
a
number
of
foolish
statesmen
who
fancied
they
were
cast
in
the
mould
of
the
great
bludiron
at
that
time
meccania
had
commercial
relations
with
the
whole
world
and
was
rapidly
penetrating
every
country
with
its
peculiar
culture
its
army
and
navy
were
growing
in
strength
and
the
temper
of
the
people
was
becoming
restless
and
aggressive
they
lacked
the
controlling
hand
of
prince
bludiron
they
were
carried
away
by
dreams
of
sudden
foolish
statesmen
allowed
the
country
to
be
plunged
into
war
with
half
the
world
at
once
the
meccanians
performed
wonders
but
they
could
not
perform
miracles
and
in
the
end
the
country
was
reduced
to
great
straits
provinces
were
torn
away
its
accumulations
of
wealth
were
exhausted
its
manhood
was
decimated
the
situation
was
terrible
yet
it
was
this
tremendous
ordeal
that
indirectly
created
the
most
favourable
conditions
for
the
work
of
prince
mechow
during
the
war
the
government
had
been
compelled
to
take
over
more
and
more
the
control
of
every
department
of
life
under
the
pressure
of
war
the
last
vestiges
of
the
obsolete
doctrines
of
individualism
had
disappeared
now
that
the
war
was
over
the
necessity
for
increasing
all
the
means
of
placed
a
new
power
in
the
hands
of
the
state
it
was
in
these
years
of
what
was
called
that
prince
mechow
came
to
the
front
every
one
was
depressed
the
most
conflicting
views
were
expressed
some
people
lamented
that
the
whole
work
of
prince
bludiron
had
been
destroyed
others
said
it
had
been
all
a
mistake
and
that
the
nation
ought
to
have
followed
the
example
of
the
rest
of
europe
some
advocated
schemes
of
as
they
called
it
prince
mechow
was
one
of
the
few
who
kept
a
clear
head
he
saw
exactly
where
the
blunder
had
been
made
meccania
had
ventured
upon
projects
of
before
completing
the
internal
work
of
perfecting
the
on
the
foundations
laid
down
by
prince
bludiron
he
saw
that
we
must
go
back
exactly
to
the
point
where
prince
bludiron
left
off
but
the
first
step
was
the
most
difficult
prince
mechow
was
quite
a
young
man
not
more
than
thirty
and
was
only
an
he
had
one
advantage
in
that
he
was
a
of
prince
bludiron
and
had
the
ear
of
the
emperor
who
very
soon
made
him
minister
of
the
interior
a
post
created
to
relieve
the
chief
minister
professor
said
we
should
obtain
the
clearest
conception
of
prince
mechow
views
and
the
best
key
to
his
policy
in
a
volume
of
correspondence
with
his
cousin
general
count
block
count
block
like
many
of
his
military
colleagues
was
alarmed
at
the
general
confusion
he
declared
there
was
nothing
for
it
but
to
sweep
away
all
popular
representative
institutions
restrict
education
to
the
upper
classes
and
fall
back
upon
the
direct
rule
of
the
military
prince
mechow
pointed
out
that
such
a
policy
would
fail
utterly
it
would
bring
about
the
very
revolution
it
sought
to
avoid
efficiency
could
never
be
created
by
the
military
alone
industrial
efficiency
was
absolutely
necessary
to
military
power
he
agreed
in
the
main
with
count
objects
but
declared
that
his
means
were
clumsy
and
inadequate
the
work
of
prince
bludiron
must
be
continued
by
the
creation
of
a
the
had
already
been
coined
but
the
did
not
yet
exist
it
is
in
prince
mechow
clear
conception
of
the
that
we
see
his
intellectual
genius
but
it
is
in
the
steps
he
took
to
bring
it
into
being
that
we
realise
his
kinship
with
his
famous
predecessor
prince
bludiron
prince
bludiron
had
had
to
live
from
hand
to
mouth
relying
upon
his
statesman
instinct
prince
mechow
even
before
he
became
chief
minister
foresaw
every
detail
of
the
structure
he
was
determined
to
erect
the
state
he
said
has
hitherto
done
only
what
is
forced
upon
it
by
necessity
it
has
never
attempted
to
utilise
the
whole
energies
of
the
nation
the
will
only
come
into
being
by
uniting
in
itself
the
will
the
knowledge
the
wisdom
and
the
multifarious
energies
of
the
whole
people
the
state
has
been
merely
the
strongest
organ
of
society
the
must
be
the
only
organ
uniting
all
others
in
itself
how
was
such
a
conception
to
be
realised
concretely
in
explaining
his
plans
he
found
ample
illustration
in
the
circumstances
of
the
recent
great
war
the
state
had
not
only
controlled
everything
essential
to
the
conduct
of
the
war
it
had
not
only
regulated
the
manufacture
of
all
supplies
including
food
and
clothing
for
the
whole
nation
but
had
undertaken
a
thousand
activities
never
previously
dreamt
of
except
by
the
socialists
he
proposed
to
capture
the
whole
armoury
of
the
socialists
by
gradually
seizing
everything
for
the
state
itself
the
motto
of
the
must
be
efficiency
but
to
be
efficient
the
state
must
absorb
all
the
persons
who
represented
efficiency
the
whole
conception
of
bureaucracy
must
be
revolutionised
by
being
carried
to
its
logical
conclusion
the
efficiency
of
a
business
firm
depends
upon
the
efficiency
of
the
persons
composing
it
the
efficiency
of
the
will
depend
upon
the
efficiency
of
the
new
bureaucracy
and
the
military
class
there
was
no
instance
in
history
of
an
efficient
government
being
overthrown
by
any
popular
forces
a
century
of
industrial
development
had
transformed
the
material
world
whilst
in
the
meantime
the
organisation
of
the
state
had
almost
stood
still
the
must
borrow
from
the
socialists
the
conception
of
an
power
and
activity
and
from
the
industrial
world
the
machinery
for
the
execution
of
its
will
the
most
efficient
and
successful
business
firms
were
those
which
got
every
ounce
of
work
out
of
every
member
of
the
firm
the
must
not
be
less
resourceful
now
as
to
the
methods
said
the
professor
how
was
the
state
to
absorb
into
its
service
all
the
energies
of
the
nation
without
at
the
same
time
becoming
a
social
democracy
already
the
social
democrats
as
in
prince
bludiron
time
were
proclaiming
that
the
capitalist
state
was
working
out
for
them
the
social
revolution
predicted
by
spotts
and
as
in
prince
bludiron
days
so
under
prince
mechow
they
went
on
waiting
for
the
social
revolution
they
are
waiting
still
in
the
meantime
prince
mechow
got
into
the
saddle
and
began
his
practical
reforms
he
was
a
man
of
the
most
extraordinary
energy
and
versatility
he
was
not
content
to
begin
with
education
and
wait
for
a
generation
he
attacked
a
dozen
different
problems
at
the
same
time
education
industry
commerce
railways
finance
the
press
the
stage
the
professions
the
church
every
side
of
national
life
received
his
attention
but
the
prime
instrument
through
which
he
worked
was
the
bureaucracy
he
laid
it
down
as
an
axiom
that
the
machinery
of
the
state
must
work
so
smoothly
that
the
people
should
be
unaware
of
its
operations
there
have
been
instances
in
history
he
wrote
in
one
of
his
letters
in
which
a
government
has
been
overturned
in
a
single
day
how
by
a
perfectly
planned
what
can
be
accomplished
on
a
single
occasion
can
be
done
as
a
part
of
the
regular
working
of
the
state
machinery
our
must
be
capable
of
a
every
day
those
of
his
friends
who
did
not
see
the
necessity
for
his
reforms
he
silenced
by
showing
them
that
if
they
did
not
capture
the
state
the
social
democracy
would
do
so
during
the
first
ten
years
of
his
regime
he
worked
wonders
he
renewed
the
state
control
of
all
the
large
industries
he
took
into
the
service
of
the
state
all
the
most
capable
business
men
and
manufacturers
all
the
best
scientists
and
engineers
as
well
as
the
best
administrators
the
censorship
of
the
press
was
continued
and
extended
to
every
form
of
literature
he
bought
up
all
the
big
newspapers
and
drove
all
the
little
ones
into
bankruptcy
when
every
clever
journalist
was
engaged
on
the
state
newspapers
and
all
advertisements
were
controlled
there
was
not
much
room
for
an
press
the
schools
and
universities
were
already
well
under
control
but
he
revised
the
whole
system
he
made
every
teacher
and
every
professor
a
direct
servant
of
the
state
every
textbook
was
revised
he
paid
particular
attention
to
history
philosophy
and
literature
the
new
generation
were
thus
educated
in
an
atmosphere
calculated
to
cultivate
the
true
meccanian
spirit
inspectors
organisers
and
directors
of
education
infused
new
energy
into
the
system
and
trained
the
whole
population
to
with
the
as
to
the
proletariat
he
saw
to
it
that
there
was
no
unemployment
production
went
up
by
leaps
and
bounds
wages
were
increased
but
there
was
no
waste
goods
that
could
not
be
disposed
of
immediately
were
stored
but
methods
of
control
and
regulation
were
introduced
to
direct
industry
into
the
right
channels
whilst
he
controlled
the
he
at
the
same
time
controlled
the
employers
all
surplus
wages
and
profits
were
invested
in
the
state
funds
of
course
there
was
opposition
to
these
reforms
the
military
class
were
slow
to
understand
his
methods
so
he
established
periodical
military
councils
took
them
into
his
confidence
and
eventually
won
them
over
completely
as
for
the
social
democrats
he
did
not
scruple
to
employ
against
them
the
same
methods
they
would
have
employed
against
him
he
made
use
of
secret
agents
to
preach
the
doctrine
that
by
his
methods
the
way
would
be
prepared
for
the
social
revolution
when
at
length
he
inaugurated
the
system
of
the
seven
social
classes
the
social
democrats
professed
to
see
in
this
a
means
of
stimulating
class
consciousness
but
after
a
few
years
they
discovered
that
no
class
was
willing
to
surrender
its
privileges
the
fifth
class
which
includes
the
most
skilled
artisans
in
europe
began
to
see
that
no
revolution
would
improve
their
position
whilst
it
might
lower
them
to
the
level
of
the
sixth
or
seventh
class
the
boasted
solidarity
of
the
proletariat
proved
to
be
an
illusion
like
most
of
spotts
ideas
when
he
reformed
the
railway
system
he
made
travelling
free
but
of
course
if
travelling
were
to
be
free
restrictions
must
be
imposed
similarly
in
regard
to
housing
he
applied
all
the
technical
knowledge
in
the
country
to
the
problem
standardised
houses
and
other
devices
made
it
possible
to
rebuild
any
portions
of
our
cities
and
to
transfer
population
from
one
region
to
another
with
the
greatest
ease
on
the
other
hand
restrictions
were
necessary
you
can
not
have
free
trade
in
houses
and
at
the
same
time
guarantee
a
house
to
every
family
i
have
condensed
lecture
which
lasted
several
hours
into
such
short
compass
that
it
gives
very
little
idea
i
am
afraid
of
the
complete
revolution
worked
out
by
prince
reforms
for
instance
he
showed
how
the
whole
character
of
politics
had
been
transformed
how
the
questions
that
agitated
meccania
sixty
years
ago
had
entirely
disappeared
how
the
press
no
longer
existed
because
its
functions
had
been
absorbed
by
other
agencies
how
the
parliament
which
i
was
surprised
to
hear
still
existed
was
now
organised
to
correspond
with
the
seven
social
classes
how
the
state
was
so
wealthy
that
control
over
taxation
was
no
longer
necessary
he
ended
with
a
remarkable
passage
about
the
seven
social
classes
and
the
national
meccanian
uniforms
many
foreign
observers
he
said
in
times
past
have
made
merry
over
our
sevenfold
classification
and
our
national
costumes
what
have
other
nations
to
put
in
their
place
they
too
have
these
classes
for
they
are
natural
and
inevitable
they
have
their
nobles
their
soldiers
their
officials
and
professional
men
their
bourgeoisie
their
artisans
their
labourers
and
their
degraded
tenth
but
they
are
afraid
to
call
them
by
their
proper
names
afraid
to
recognise
them
they
have
no
uniforms
no
dignified
and
pleasing
costumes
but
you
never
mistake
one
class
for
another
you
never
mistake
the
labourer
for
the
wealthy
bourgeois
or
the
popinjay
aristocrat
nowhere
else
they
say
would
people
consent
to
wear
the
servile
badge
of
their
caste
we
meccanians
are
proud
of
our
seven
national
colours
so
far
from
being
a
degradation
the
historical
origin
of
the
costumes
proves
that
it
is
a
privilege
to
wear
them
the
seven
uniforms
were
once
the
ceremonial
dress
of
the
seven
guilds
established
by
prince
mechow
when
permission
was
granted
for
all
the
members
of
the
classes
to
wear
the
ceremonial
dress
it
was
the
occasion
of
national
rejoicings
everywhere
the
national
costumes
are
part
of
the
ritual
of
the
as
some
parts
of
the
lecture
were
i
must
confess
it
was
most
illuminating
and
to
me
as
a
student
of
politics
and
sociology
exceedingly
interesting
i
begin
to
understand
now
what
the
meccanian
really
is
chapter
v
culture
in
mecco
during
the
first
few
weeks
of
my
tour
in
mecco
tour
no
conductor
prigge
kept
my
nose
well
to
the
grindstone
at
times
he
made
me
feel
like
a
small
schoolboy
at
times
like
a
prisoner
in
charge
of
a
warder
it
would
be
tedious
to
detail
all
the
incidents
of
my
daily
rounds
or
to
describe
everything
in
the
exact
order
in
which
it
was
presented
to
my
view
so
i
propose
to
set
down
as
they
remain
in
my
mind
the
most
interesting
or
remarkable
features
of
this
truly
remarkable
city
one
circumstance
however
annoys
and
almost
distresses
me
i
can
not
get
into
contact
with
any
individual
living
people
i
see
everything
as
a
spectacle
from
the
outside
as
i
go
about
the
impression
of
orderliness
cleanliness
and
even
magnificence
of
a
kind
is
such
as
i
have
seldom
felt
in
any
part
of
the
world
at
times
the
whole
city
gives
one
the
same
sort
of
feeling
that
one
experiences
in
going
through
a
gigantic
hospital
where
everything
is
spotless
and
nothing
is
out
of
its
place
i
am
even
getting
used
to
the
coloured
uniforms
of
the
seven
classes
in
the
central
parts
of
the
city
green
and
yellow
predominate
for
the
number
of
people
belonging
to
the
official
class
is
enormous
even
apart
from
their
actual
number
they
are
the
most
conspicuous
because
the
lower
classes
are
at
work
in
their
factories
and
business
houses
and
are
consequently
seldom
seen
except
when
returning
home
in
the
evening
occasionally
i
notice
a
few
white
uniforms
of
the
very
select
first
class
and
occasionally
too
a
crowd
of
officers
in
their
brilliant
scarlet
uniforms
at
the
other
end
of
the
scale
the
most
common
colour
visible
is
the
grey
worn
by
the
numerous
servants
in
the
quarters
the
few
servants
who
wear
chocolate
are
mostly
the
lackeys
of
the
very
rich
and
the
upper
servants
in
the
large
hotels
on
the
day
after
lecture
conductor
prigge
was
more
than
usually
pedagogic
i
wanted
to
look
about
the
streets
and
ask
questions
about
many
things
that
occurred
to
me
at
the
moment
but
he
insisted
upon
pouring
out
detailed
information
about
the
drainage
system
the
postal
areas
the
parcels
delivery
areas
the
telephone
system
the
market
system
and
so
forth
what
did
interest
me
however
was
the
organisation
known
as
the
time
department
of
which
i
had
already
seen
something
at
bridgetown
there
is
as
i
have
said
an
enormous
number
of
public
buildings
in
mecco
but
nobody
can
miss
the
gigantic
office
of
the
time
department
it
towers
up
about
seven
stories
high
over
the
surrounding
buildings
and
above
it
rises
a
great
clock
that
can
be
seen
for
miles
in
this
central
department
alone
ten
thousand
people
are
employed
that
is
of
course
in
addition
to
all
those
employed
in
the
local
offices
of
the
time
department
in
various
parts
of
the
country
conductor
prigge
was
tremendously
proud
of
the
time
department
other
nations
he
said
have
never
thought
of
establishing
such
an
institution
for
themselves
they
have
not
even
had
the
intelligence
to
imitate
ours
we
meccanians
were
the
first
to
discover
both
time
and
space
our
philosophers
were
the
first
to
understand
time
and
space
we
have
been
the
first
government
to
organise
time
and
space
we
can
tell
you
he
went
on
the
exact
amount
of
time
occupied
by
any
person
or
any
group
of
persons
in
doing
anything
we
know
exactly
how
much
time
is
devoted
to
eating
and
drinking
as
well
as
the
time
required
to
produce
a
picture
or
a
piece
of
sculpture
or
a
poem
or
a
musical
composition
or
how
long
it
takes
to
learn
any
language
or
any
subject
of
study
but
i
said
what
about
the
time
spent
by
all
the
clerks
and
officials
employed
all
over
the
country
as
well
as
here
in
the
time
department
itself
is
it
rather
extravagant
what
is
the
object
of
it
all
do
you
think
he
replied
that
we
should
keep
up
such
an
institution
if
it
had
not
proved
to
be
useful
in
the
highest
degree
foreigners
have
such
childish
ideas
of
organisation
he
continued
this
was
one
of
the
most
brilliant
inventions
of
prince
mechow
but
it
has
taken
thirty
years
to
bring
it
to
its
present
state
of
perfection
it
pays
for
itself
over
and
over
again
in
the
mere
economy
it
effects
and
it
has
other
effects
on
the
whole
social
and
economic
life
of
the
nation
in
the
first
place
in
the
matter
of
material
production
in
every
trade
and
occupation
it
enables
us
to
scientifically
an
increase
of
per
cent
in
the
productiveness
of
the
four
main
industries
alone
would
more
than
pay
all
the
expenses
of
the
time
department
we
have
increased
productiveness
all
round
by
at
least
per
cent
since
the
introduction
of
the
time
department
and
although
not
all
of
this
increase
is
due
to
the
time
department
we
may
safely
reckon
per
cent
we
have
done
away
with
all
the
dawdlers
in
art
all
the
incompetent
painters
and
novelists
and
poets
in
connection
with
the
post
office
we
have
been
able
to
diminish
the
amount
of
time
spent
in
writing
useless
letters
by
per
cent
why
without
the
time
department
the
department
for
the
direction
of
leisure
would
be
helpless
in
education
how
should
we
know
the
right
proportion
of
time
to
be
devoted
to
the
various
subjects
the
right
amount
to
recreation
or
amusement
and
apart
from
economy
the
aid
given
to
the
researches
of
the
sociological
department
is
simply
invaluable
the
efficiency
of
the
police
department
is
due
in
great
measure
to
the
time
department
but
i
inquired
innocently
is
there
no
feeling
of
resentment
on
the
part
of
the
public
at
the
somewhat
inquisitorial
methods
of
the
time
department
resentment
he
said
almost
angrily
why
should
there
be
resentment
at
having
to
give
an
account
of
all
that
one
does
even
in
leisure
time
but
when
everybody
knows
that
we
save
millions
a
year
by
it
and
when
the
state
has
decided
that
it
is
for
the
public
benefit
and
the
obligation
is
imposed
upon
everybody
why
should
anyone
raise
objections
still
i
said
remembering
my
unfortunate
experience
you
find
it
necessary
to
inflict
fines
in
order
to
ensure
compliance
with
the
regulations
about
filling
up
the
weekly
diaries
naturally
but
perhaps
you
overlook
the
educative
effect
of
having
to
keep
the
diary
the
proper
keeping
of
the
diary
is
almost
an
education
in
itself
my
conductor
said
this
with
such
an
air
of
finality
that
i
thought
it
was
not
worth
while
to
pursue
the
question
further
i
was
much
amused
by
a
conversation
i
had
a
few
days
ago
on
another
subject
it
was
about
five
and
i
was
feeling
rather
tired
so
i
proposed
that
we
should
have
a
meal
in
a
restaurant
and
then
go
to
some
place
of
amusement
in
the
evening
you
may
return
to
the
hotel
if
you
are
indisposed
said
prigge
and
rest
there
during
the
evening
or
you
may
have
a
meal
in
a
restaurant
and
resume
your
tour
but
until
we
have
completed
at
least
the
first
week
tour
of
observation
you
can
not
possibly
be
permitted
to
visit
any
place
of
amusement
as
you
call
it
besides
such
places
as
you
probably
have
in
mind
do
not
exist
in
mecco
i
have
seen
in
other
countries
what
are
termed
music
halls
where
a
lot
of
actors
were
making
fools
of
themselves
perhaps
i
ventured
to
say
you
did
not
look
at
the
performance
from
the
right
point
of
view
i
see
you
mean
that
i
should
have
regarded
these
childish
performances
as
illustrating
the
stage
of
mental
culture
of
the
people
from
that
point
of
view
your
halls
may
be
of
some
interest
just
as
the
drama
of
foreign
countries
is
of
interest
but
it
is
so
very
primitive
primitive
in
what
way
primitive
i
asked
primitive
by
comparison
with
our
highly
developed
drama
for
example
all
the
foreign
dramas
i
have
seen
are
written
in
the
narrative
form
or
rather
i
should
say
the
drama
is
still
in
the
chronological
stage
we
have
left
that
behind
indeed
i
said
i
am
afraid
i
can
hardly
conceive
of
drama
in
any
other
form
exactly
can
not
understand
but
our
meccanian
culture
is
not
exactly
designed
for
the
intelligence
of
foreigners
if
you
are
specially
interested
in
the
subject
of
the
drama
it
is
not
one
of
my
specialities
although
of
course
i
am
not
ignorant
of
the
drama
no
meccanian
is
i
will
introduce
you
to
my
friend
in
the
department
of
public
amusement
which
is
a
branch
of
the
ministry
of
education
and
culture
he
will
probably
enable
you
in
the
shortest
period
of
time
and
that
is
always
a
consideration
although
most
foreigners
are
often
quite
oblivious
of
the
time
aspect
of
such
matters
to
understand
the
meccanian
drama
in
so
far
as
it
is
possible
for
a
foreigner
to
understand
it
i
thanked
him
and
he
made
a
note
in
his
to
remind
him
of
his
promise
perhaps
you
can
tell
me
i
said
how
your
people
do
amuse
themselves
apart
from
going
to
the
theatre
for
they
can
not
go
to
the
theatre
every
evening
i
notice
that
like
all
foreigners
you
are
more
interested
in
amusement
than
in
the
serious
aspects
of
life
you
will
receive
full
information
at
the
proper
time
if
you
will
avail
yourself
of
my
offer
to
take
you
to
my
friend
dodderer
the
of
public
amusements
section
b
but
i
do
not
mind
giving
you
a
few
facts
such
as
are
common
knowledge
among
all
meccanians
well
i
said
take
your
commercial
travellers
who
must
spend
a
good
deal
of
time
in
towns
away
from
home
what
do
they
do
in
the
evenings
if
you
were
to
go
to
the
great
meccanian
library
he
replied
and
consult
the
reports
of
the
sociological
department
for
the
last
twenty
years
you
would
be
able
to
see
exactly
how
all
these
persons
have
spent
their
time
but
you
would
perhaps
be
surprised
to
find
that
the
number
of
persons
travelling
about
and
staying
away
from
home
is
very
small
when
you
have
studied
our
industrial
and
commercial
system
you
will
see
that
we
require
comparatively
few
commercial
travellers
as
to
the
way
they
spend
their
time
you
must
understand
that
in
every
town
there
are
guilds
of
all
the
professions
consequently
as
every
commercial
traveller
naturally
wishes
to
improve
his
knowledge
he
frequents
the
guild
house
where
he
meets
with
other
members
of
his
profession
and
discusses
matters
of
interest
if
he
comes
from
mecco
he
will
be
welcomed
as
the
provincial
members
will
be
only
too
glad
to
learn
anything
from
one
who
comes
from
the
very
centre
of
meccanian
culture
also
he
may
wish
to
visit
the
local
museums
or
other
cultural
institutions
if
not
he
will
attend
either
an
outdoor
or
an
indoor
concert
the
commercial
travellers
of
meccania
must
be
quite
unlike
the
commercial
travellers
of
all
other
countries
if
they
spend
their
leisure
in
the
way
you
have
described
i
remarked
you
spoke
of
concerts
i
continued
i
suppose
music
is
still
the
most
popular
form
of
amusement
in
meccania
neither
the
drama
nor
music
are
strictly
speaking
mere
amusements
answered
conductor
prigge
they
may
be
so
regarded
in
other
countries
but
not
in
meccania
then
what
are
they
i
asked
they
form
part
of
our
general
scheme
of
culture
replied
prigge
as
you
probably
know
attendance
at
the
theatre
once
a
week
is
compulsory
for
all
persons
over
eighteen
those
below
eighteen
attend
the
juvenile
theatre
as
part
of
their
school
course
in
literature
attendance
compulsory
i
said
but
if
meccanians
are
so
advanced
in
the
cultivation
of
the
drama
why
should
it
be
necessary
to
enforce
attendance
perhaps
it
is
not
really
necessary
but
i
doubt
whether
our
scheme
of
dramatic
culture
could
be
carried
out
without
strict
regulation
for
instance
there
are
some
plays
more
popular
than
others
people
would
want
to
see
these
plays
in
great
numbers
and
there
would
not
be
room
for
them
whilst
the
less
popular
plays
would
not
be
well
attended
just
so
i
said
that
is
what
one
would
naturally
expect
and
where
is
the
harm
our
scheme
provides
a
succession
of
plays
throughout
the
year
all
designed
as
part
of
our
culture
and
if
people
were
at
liberty
to
pick
and
choose
what
they
would
see
and
what
they
would
not
see
we
should
have
no
guarantee
that
they
would
have
gone
through
the
course
would
that
matter
i
asked
so
long
as
they
were
amused
may
i
repeat
that
the
meccanian
drama
is
something
more
than
amusement
he
replied
testily
you
will
learn
more
of
this
subject
from
dodderer
we
need
not
pursue
it
further
then
may
i
ask
whether
attendance
at
concerts
is
compulsory
also
it
is
not
compulsory
but
it
is
strictly
regulated
as
regards
the
different
grades
of
music
he
answered
i
should
like
to
know
how
you
regulate
attendance
at
concerts
i
said
i
have
never
heard
of
it
elsewhere
i
dare
say
not
said
prigge
other
countries
are
still
in
a
very
backward
state
as
regards
musical
culture
in
the
first
place
all
persons
below
eighteen
have
to
pass
an
examination
in
some
branch
of
practical
or
theoretical
music
unless
they
are
defective
in
the
musical
sense
then
before
any
adult
is
admitted
to
the
first
second
or
third
grades
of
concerts
he
has
to
pass
an
examination
in
musical
appreciation
that
is
to
say
only
those
are
admitted
to
concerts
of
the
first
class
who
hold
a
certificate
in
musical
appreciation
and
so
on
with
the
other
grades
otherwise
we
should
have
people
whose
musical
knowledge
is
very
moderate
listening
to
the
best
music
by
the
best
performers
by
means
of
our
system
we
can
provide
exactly
the
right
standard
of
music
at
all
public
concerts
at
the
beginning
of
each
season
the
programmes
of
all
the
concerts
of
the
first
three
grades
are
issued
each
person
enters
his
name
for
a
course
of
concerts
according
to
the
grade
of
musical
culture
attained
by
him
he
is
informed
how
many
concerts
he
may
attend
in
the
season
he
then
chooses
which
concerts
he
will
attend
and
after
that
there
is
no
difficulty
no
said
i
i
should
think
there
would
be
no
difficulty
after
such
careful
preparation
then
the
concerts
in
the
beer
gardens
i
said
where
do
they
come
in
those
are
not
regulated
in
the
same
way
we
can
tell
from
the
time
department
whether
any
person
is
spending
too
much
time
at
these
performances
and
any
person
who
neglects
to
pass
his
examination
in
musical
appreciation
before
the
age
of
thirty
is
forbidden
to
attend
such
concerts
if
they
can
be
called
concerts
more
than
once
a
week
and
is
it
possible
to
carry
out
such
a
regulation
i
asked
you
have
not
studied
our
time
department
to
much
purpose
if
you
ask
such
a
question
answered
prigge
i
suppose
then
i
said
as
i
have
no
certificate
i
shall
not
be
permitted
to
hear
any
of
your
best
music
foreigners
who
are
doctors
of
music
of
any
university
replied
prigge
are
admitted
by
special
leave
of
the
ministry
of
culture
to
attend
a
specified
number
of
concerts
even
of
the
first
grade
and
others
can
attend
a
few
concerts
of
the
third
grade
likewise
by
special
permission
of
the
ministry
of
culture
i
think
it
was
on
the
same
day
that
prigge
said
to
me
i
notice
you
are
not
wearing
your
spectacles
i
have
never
worn
spectacles
i
said
but
you
were
ordered
to
wear
spectacles
by
dr
pincher
he
did
prescribe
them
i
said
but
i
have
not
troubled
to
get
them
as
i
do
not
really
require
them
conductor
prigge
looked
positively
aghast
you
must
go
at
once
he
said
you
have
the
address
you
had
better
pretend
that
there
has
been
some
delay
but
no
your
diary
will
show
that
you
have
not
been
to
the
optician
you
will
certainly
be
fined
in
accordance
with
regulation
of
the
instructions
to
foreign
observers
i
went
accordingly
and
in
a
few
days
i
had
the
spectacles
i
suppose
this
incident
caused
me
to
notice
that
nearly
all
meccanians
wear
spectacles
or
eyeglasses
some
wear
two
pairs
at
once
and
i
have
seen
even
three
pairs
worn
i
felt
thankful
nothing
wrong
with
my
teeth
had
been
discovered
a
day
or
two
later
i
was
taken
by
prigge
to
see
dodderer
what
i
learnt
from
him
was
even
more
remarkable
than
what
my
conductor
had
told
me
so
i
will
not
apologise
for
giving
a
fairly
full
account
of
my
interview
we
were
due
at
ten
and
a
whole
hour
had
been
reserved
for
me
as
we
entered
his
room
he
noted
the
exact
time
on
his
tablet
and
said
the
object
of
your
visit
is
to
learn
something
of
the
meccanian
drama
as
part
of
the
system
of
culture
and
the
relation
of
amusement
to
our
system
of
culture
very
good
if
you
will
be
seated
i
will
do
my
best
to
enlighten
you
he
was
a
little
man
with
bright
black
eyes
and
a
narrow
but
lofty
forehead
i
thanked
him
and
prepared
to
listen
i
knew
he
would
think
me
disrespectful
if
i
did
not
make
use
of
my
notebook
so
i
prepared
to
make
copious
notes
when
he
saw
i
was
ready
he
sat
with
his
eyes
shut
and
his
hands
clasped
together
in
front
of
him
and
proceeded
to
pour
forth
a
long
discourse
he
began
by
saying
that
all
the
higher
animals
showed
some
disposition
towards
play
and
that
in
particular
the
human
animal
was
distinguished
in
this
respect
some
anthropologists
had
argued
that
the
persistence
of
the
was
a
proof
of
the
essential
usefulness
of
play
in
developing
both
muscular
and
intellectual
power
he
himself
did
not
adopt
this
view
or
at
any
rate
only
in
a
modified
form
he
held
that
play
was
one
of
the
most
wasteful
methods
of
nature
and
that
if
the
competition
between
the
various
races
and
subdivisions
of
the
human
species
had
been
perfect
the
race
that
could
reduce
play
to
an
absolute
minimum
confined
perhaps
to
the
first
three
years
of
life
would
succeed
in
winning
the
foremost
place
play
was
certainly
the
least
profitable
form
of
mental
activity
and
one
of
the
problems
of
education
was
the
gradual
elimination
of
play
from
the
scheme
of
national
culture
it
was
unfortunately
true
that
even
the
best
system
of
education
had
to
make
concessions
to
this
instinct
of
play
and
it
would
take
many
generations
before
it
could
be
reduced
to
a
minimum
but
the
experiments
of
the
meccanian
psychologists
had
demonstrated
that
the
amount
necessary
both
in
the
case
of
children
and
in
the
case
of
adults
had
been
grossly
exaggerated
in
the
past
and
was
still
grossly
exaggerated
by
other
nations
these
experiments
would
have
been
impossible
without
the
assistance
of
the
time
department
and
the
absence
of
a
time
department
in
other
countries
probably
accounted
for
the
little
progress
they
had
made
in
this
direction
for
example
he
continued
other
nations
have
almost
entirely
neglected
the
value
of
cultural
toys
they
have
been
content
even
where
they
have
given
any
thought
at
all
to
the
subject
to
devise
toys
which
gave
a
little
more
opportunity
for
ingenuity
but
their
object
has
been
mainly
to
amuse
they
have
had
no
clear
conception
of
the
ultimate
purpose
of
toys
in
a
complete
cultural
scheme
now
we
have
a
carefully
scheme
and
although
it
does
not
come
under
my
department
but
under
section
it
affords
a
good
illustration
of
the
basis
of
our
system
all
our
toys
are
classified
in
fifteen
stages
we
began
with
only
five
stages
but
the
number
has
gradually
increased
for
the
system
necessarily
becomes
more
complex
as
it
becomes
more
perfect
stage
is
represented
by
simple
objects
which
a
baby
can
grasp
and
recognise
before
the
age
of
eighteen
months
stage
ii
is
represented
by
balls
and
cubes
and
objects
of
that
order
stage
iii
by
dolls
and
images
stage
iv
by
objects
which
can
be
grouped
so
as
to
afford
a
basis
for
the
teaching
of
number
stage
by
simple
mechanical
toys
and
simple
tools
stage
vi
by
constructive
blocks
of
various
kinds
here
i
am
afraid
i
became
confused
but
i
remember
that
stage
xiii
was
represented
by
toys
which
formed
an
introduction
to
chemistry
and
that
the
toys
of
stage
xiv
could
only
be
worked
by
boys
whose
mathematical
knowledge
was
far
in
advance
of
what
i
should
have
thought
possible
he
explained
that
visits
were
paid
by
the
domestic
inspectors
of
to
see
that
the
parents
made
proper
use
of
the
system
of
cultural
toys
there
had
been
great
difficulty
at
first
but
the
parents
were
now
properly
instructed
and
in
a
short
time
there
would
be
no
need
to
instruct
them
as
they
would
have
grown
up
in
familiarity
with
the
system
other
experiments
equally
valuable
have
been
conducted
in
order
to
discover
what
forms
of
amusement
are
most
profitable
from
the
cultural
point
of
view
these
include
experiments
designed
to
improve
production
for
example
in
our
schools
for
the
children
of
the
seventh
class
we
find
we
have
to
allow
a
considerable
time
for
pursuits
it
would
be
sheer
waste
to
allow
all
this
time
to
be
given
to
mere
amusement
children
who
can
not
give
more
than
three
hours
a
day
to
study
can
be
very
usefully
employed
in
making
simple
articles
we
have
a
number
of
simple
machines
which
can
be
worked
by
quite
small
children
you
would
be
surprised
to
learn
perhaps
that
goods
worth
a
million
are
exported
annually
which
are
all
the
product
of
the
work
of
these
children
on
the
other
hand
any
boys
of
the
class
who
can
not
profitably
be
kept
at
intellectual
pursuits
for
more
than
a
few
hours
a
day
are
trained
to
be
active
and
bold
and
in
preparation
for
their
military
career
the
same
principle
applies
not
only
to
children
at
school
but
to
people
of
all
ages
for
example
we
discovered
through
our
time
department
again
that
thousands
of
men
were
wasting
precious
hours
upon
games
such
as
chess
we
have
introduced
mathematical
exercises
of
an
interesting
kind
as
a
substitute
with
most
beneficial
results
others
were
addicted
to
aimless
walks
and
rambles
in
the
country
we
began
by
offering
prizes
for
botanical
entomological
and
other
specimens
and
for
essays
upon
scientific
subjects
we
have
in
fact
almost
eliminated
aimless
amusement
from
the
life
of
our
common
people
in
the
fifth
class
which
is
a
highly
intelligent
class
we
encourage
the
pursuit
of
science
by
promoting
those
who
pass
certain
examinations
which
include
a
thesis
to
the
first
grade
of
their
class
and
in
a
few
cases
we
are
able
to
promote
exceptionally
promising
young
men
to
the
fourth
class
in
what
way
does
this
bear
upon
the
drama
i
said
in
a
pause
in
dodderer
discourse
i
have
been
trying
to
show
you
the
basis
of
our
system
of
public
amusement
with
us
amusement
is
never
an
end
in
itself
we
find
a
certain
crude
kind
of
interest
in
the
drama
or
shall
i
say
in
the
theatre
in
almost
all
peoples
and
some
of
the
greatest
poets
have
utilised
that
interest
in
order
to
reach
the
minds
of
their
hearers
the
greatest
poets
are
those
who
have
conceded
least
to
the
mere
instinct
for
amusement
we
have
followed
the
same
principle
but
we
could
not
carry
out
this
scheme
of
dramatic
culture
without
first
getting
control
over
the
theatre
prince
mechow
with
his
usual
insight
saw
that
it
was
useless
to
control
and
direct
the
press
if
he
did
not
at
the
same
time
control
and
direct
the
theatre
first
of
all
he
made
the
censorship
a
reality
then
he
took
all
the
most
popular
playwrights
into
the
state
service
then
he
was
able
to
weed
out
those
who
were
incapable
of
entering
into
his
purpose
gradually
all
the
theatres
became
cultural
institutions
of
the
state
all
this
took
time
of
course
even
now
there
are
a
few
popular
theatres
where
only
the
lower
kinds
of
dramatic
varieties
are
performed
attendance
at
these
is
not
compulsory
i
do
not
yet
understand
i
said
why
it
should
be
necessary
to
make
attendance
compulsory
when
the
drama
is
so
popular
for
the
majority
of
the
people
replied
dodderer
compulsion
is
quite
unnecessary
but
it
is
just
those
who
are
most
in
need
of
the
culture
that
can
be
given
through
the
medium
of
the
drama
who
would
be
lax
in
their
attendance
the
whole
subject
has
been
investigated
he
continued
by
the
aid
of
the
time
department
and
we
are
satisfied
that
we
get
the
best
results
through
our
present
system
since
your
playwrights
became
civil
servants
has
there
been
no
decline
in
the
quality
of
your
dramatic
productions
i
asked
on
the
contrary
replied
dodderer
our
modern
plays
are
on
a
much
higher
level
there
are
several
reasons
for
this
in
the
first
place
in
the
old
days
the
uninstructed
public
were
hardly
fit
judges
of
dramatic
or
literary
excellence
they
often
preferred
plays
of
little
cultural
value
consequently
the
men
who
could
write
really
good
plays
often
found
it
impossible
to
get
them
produced
our
board
of
dramatic
criticism
is
now
able
to
decide
the
merits
of
all
plays
and
the
dramatists
are
quite
independent
of
the
caprice
of
the
public
also
we
can
carry
specialisation
to
a
point
undreamt
of
in
former
times
specialisation
i
said
that
is
quite
a
new
idea
to
me
naturally
there
are
writers
who
have
plenty
of
ingenuity
in
devising
plots
but
who
are
lacking
in
literary
style
others
who
write
excellent
meccanian
both
prose
and
verse
but
who
are
weak
in
the
dramatic
instinct
it
is
in
fact
very
seldom
that
a
modern
meccanian
drama
is
the
sole
work
of
any
single
author
moreover
the
drama
as
developed
by
us
lends
itself
particularly
to
specialisation
for
example
most
of
our
classical
plays
are
presented
in
four
phases
the
simplest
phase
comes
first
the
subject
is
presented
in
form
somewhat
resembling
the
dramas
of
other
days
and
other
countries
next
comes
the
analytical
phase
and
after
that
the
synthetic
the
last
phase
or
act
is
a
complete
philosophical
symposium
in
which
the
whole
subject
is
presented
in
its
highest
and
most
abstract
form
when
you
speak
of
the
subject
of
a
play
what
do
you
mean
exactly
i
asked
the
old
plays
had
often
no
real
subject
they
had
titles
it
is
true
but
these
titles
were
mere
names
of
persons
or
mere
names
of
places
or
incidents
what
for
instance
can
you
make
of
a
title
such
as
or
emperor
of
the
or
or
tyrant
of
or
crime
of
if
you
are
acquainted
with
the
development
of
the
drama
you
will
know
that
about
ninety
years
ago
a
great
advance
was
made
by
means
of
what
was
then
called
problem
play
some
of
these
plays
had
a
real
subject
we
have
gone
much
further
of
course
take
the
subjects
of
some
of
our
plays
these
are
all
by
our
chief
grubber
his
latest
play
is
in
my
opinion
even
better
than
these
i
exclaimed
what
an
extraordinary
subject
it
is
one
of
a
series
of
medical
plays
explained
dodderer
quite
undisturbed
the
subject
lends
itself
splendidly
to
the
methods
of
meccanian
art
the
part
played
by
uric
acid
in
the
life
of
the
individual
the
family
the
state
treated
physiologically
pathologically
sociologically
ethically
and
philosophically
is
almost
infinite
in
its
possibilities
and
grubber
has
made
the
most
of
them
and
do
the
public
enjoy
these
medical
plays
you
appear
to
be
obsessed
if
i
may
say
so
replied
dodderer
with
the
idea
of
enjoyment
you
must
bear
in
mind
our
standpoint
which
i
have
already
explained
but
certainly
the
public
take
great
interest
in
the
medical
plays
smellie
wrote
a
series
and
which
are
almost
equal
to
grubber
but
he
fails
a
little
in
the
higher
aspects
of
the
subject
and
consequently
his
fourth
acts
fall
short
of
the
highest
philosophical
perfection
i
remember
reading
the
proofs
of
his
first
play
it
was
excellent
until
he
came
to
the
philosophical
phase
it
reminded
me
of
an
older
play
produced
in
the
transition
period
some
fifty
years
ago
called
blind
and
the
it
had
a
considerable
vogue
for
several
years
but
you
see
from
its
title
that
the
conception
was
not
fully
developed
these
medical
plays
i
said
are
not
the
most
typical
productions
of
the
dramatic
genius
of
modern
meccania
i
suppose
in
some
ways
they
are
replied
dodderer
that
is
to
say
they
are
almost
peculiar
to
our
country
but
one
of
our
younger
playwrights
has
developed
the
subject
of
economics
in
a
way
almost
equally
unique
his
of
and
his
and
are
a
mere
introduction
to
his
masterpiece
a
very
slight
work
on
which
was
almost
a
farce
first
attracted
the
attention
of
the
board
of
criticism
they
refused
to
produce
in
its
original
form
and
he
embodied
it
in
a
more
mature
work
which
was
the
first
of
his
genuine
economic
plays
i
suppose
then
you
have
historical
or
at
least
political
plays
historical
plays
are
mostly
performed
in
the
juvenile
theatres
he
said
i
have
very
little
to
do
with
them
they
fall
under
section
a
and
as
you
know
i
am
the
of
section
b
replied
dodderer
but
he
continued
we
have
a
certain
number
of
more
advanced
historical
plays
for
adults
for
instance
evolution
of
with
its
sequel
triumph
of
are
excellent
historical
plays
political
plays
have
become
almost
obsolete
but
there
are
still
a
few
produced
occasionally
principle
of
is
still
quite
a
classic
in
its
way
and
futility
of
is
one
of
the
most
brilliant
pieces
of
meccanian
satire
is
another
classic
it
seems
to
me
a
very
remarkable
fact
that
your
sixth
and
seventh
classes
should
be
able
to
appreciate
such
plays
as
those
you
have
been
describing
i
said
especially
in
parts
of
the
country
which
can
not
be
so
far
advanced
as
the
capital
i
do
not
say
that
they
appreciate
the
drama
in
the
same
degree
as
the
more
educated
classes
but
you
must
remember
they
have
gone
through
a
long
course
of
training
you
perhaps
now
appreciate
our
wisdom
in
making
attendance
compulsory
without
regularity
in
attendance
we
could
not
arrange
for
a
proper
sequence
of
plays
also
i
must
admit
that
on
the
days
when
the
sixth
and
seventh
classes
are
due
to
attend
we
put
on
the
less
advanced
plays
as
a
rule
what
happens
i
asked
to
the
old
plays
which
were
written
say
a
hundred
years
ago
are
they
never
performed
oh
dear
yes
replied
dodderer
the
performance
of
such
plays
forms
a
regular
part
of
the
literature
course
at
all
our
universities
and
colleges
we
also
utilise
quite
a
number
of
them
in
the
courses
of
plays
for
the
fifth
sixth
and
seventh
classes
but
the
form
in
which
they
are
written
is
so
simple
and
childish
such
a
contrast
to
the
ripe
perfection
of
the
fully
developed
meccanian
drama
it
must
be
a
difficult
matter
i
remarked
to
arrange
for
progressive
courses
of
plays
for
so
many
people
as
you
have
in
mecco
on
the
contrary
the
larger
the
city
the
easier
it
is
members
of
the
third
class
and
of
course
of
higher
classes
are
considered
capable
of
appreciating
all
kinds
of
plays
class
four
consists
of
four
grades
and
the
two
higher
grades
all
the
members
of
which
are
over
thirty
are
likewise
eligible
to
attend
any
plays
we
have
a
very
simple
plan
of
classifying
all
the
others
at
the
age
of
eighteen
they
are
all
at
liberty
to
attend
plays
which
are
classed
as
stage
then
after
six
months
any
one
is
at
liberty
to
apply
for
a
certificate
entitling
him
to
attend
plays
in
stage
ii
after
another
year
they
can
obtain
a
certificate
for
stage
iii
and
so
on
we
seldom
refuse
an
application
and
in
fact
we
rather
encourage
our
people
to
advance
otherwise
many
people
would
be
content
to
remain
in
stage
or
stage
all
their
lives
then
at
the
beginning
of
each
season
we
know
how
many
to
provide
for
in
each
class
and
at
each
stage
and
the
greater
the
number
of
theatres
the
easier
it
is
to
arrange
the
plays
accordingly
what
about
the
actors
i
asked
in
most
countries
the
leading
actors
are
very
much
sought
after
and
can
make
large
fortunes
i
should
imagine
your
system
does
not
allow
of
that
kind
of
career
for
a
successful
actor
all
our
actors
replied
dodderer
are
trained
in
the
imperial
meccanian
dramatic
college
the
lower
grades
belong
to
the
fifth
class
the
higher
grades
to
the
fourth
the
technique
of
acting
has
been
brought
to
such
perfection
that
the
as
he
used
to
be
called
has
entirely
disappeared
there
is
no
room
for
him
in
our
system
the
was
a
mere
product
of
popular
enthusiasm
how
do
you
judge
then
of
the
popularity
of
any
particular
actor
we
take
no
account
of
it
at
all
replied
dodderer
our
expert
board
of
dramatic
criticism
determines
the
standing
of
each
actor
we
have
of
course
expert
psychologists
who
are
able
to
test
the
particular
psychological
effect
both
of
each
phase
of
the
play
and
of
the
impression
made
by
individual
actors
their
experiments
are
of
great
value
both
to
our
dramatic
managers
and
to
the
writers
of
plays
at
this
point
dodderer
announced
that
the
hour
he
had
reserved
for
me
was
at
an
end
chapter
vi
more
culture
in
mecco
i
returned
to
conductor
prigge
and
my
daily
grind
but
as
most
of
this
first
period
was
spent
in
visiting
systematically
a
number
of
institutions
similar
to
those
i
had
seen
in
bridgetown
but
on
a
larger
scale
it
is
hardly
necessary
to
describe
them
here
for
instance
the
arrangements
for
receiving
and
distributing
food
are
on
the
same
principle
the
markets
are
managed
in
the
same
way
the
general
system
of
shopping
is
the
same
except
that
as
the
city
is
much
larger
there
is
very
much
more
by
post
as
the
shops
are
not
permitted
to
display
anything
in
shop
windows
nor
to
advertise
except
in
the
trade
gazettes
and
catalogues
there
is
not
much
incentive
to
spend
time
in
desultory
shopping
the
great
stores
are
more
like
warehouses
than
shops
i
had
gathered
from
my
conversations
with
sheep
that
the
state
seemed
to
place
obstacles
in
the
way
of
personal
expenditure
and
yet
at
the
same
time
production
was
encouraged
sheep
explanations
had
not
seemed
to
me
entirely
satisfactory
so
i
decided
to
question
prigge
on
this
interesting
point
as
his
services
were
charged
for
at
double
the
rate
of
sheep
i
thought
i
ought
to
get
more
complete
information
from
him
so
one
day
i
said
to
him
how
is
it
that
in
meccania
as
far
as
i
can
judge
you
have
brought
production
to
such
a
pitch
of
perfection
i
mean
as
regards
the
enormous
quantities
manufactured
whilst
at
the
same
time
you
seem
to
restrict
expenditure
or
consumption
in
so
many
ways
prigge
tilted
back
his
head
and
put
on
his
professorial
air
such
a
question
would
be
better
dealt
with
when
you
come
to
make
a
definite
study
of
our
national
economy
but
as
it
is
really
quite
an
elementary
question
a
commonplace
of
all
our
textbooks
i
do
not
mind
explaining
it
briefly
now
your
first
error
is
in
supposing
that
the
state
encourages
production
indiscriminately
we
produce
what
we
require
and
no
more
but
we
are
able
to
measure
our
requirements
better
than
other
nations
in
other
countries
people
are
allowed
to
buy
a
lot
of
things
they
do
not
require
this
causes
unnecessary
production
of
course
unregulated
consumption
gives
rise
to
unregulated
production
i
still
felt
puzzled
as
to
what
became
of
the
wealth
produced
by
the
wonderfully
efficient
system
of
wholesale
production
for
as
far
as
i
could
tell
the
people
seemed
less
luxurious
in
their
habits
than
those
of
countries
far
less
advanced
in
machine
production
but
i
felt
i
should
be
getting
on
dangerous
ground
and
forbore
the
commercial
quarter
in
which
we
spent
a
whole
day
was
remarkably
small
for
so
large
a
city
especially
considering
that
the
city
is
not
commercially
but
i
learnt
that
mecco
is
not
really
the
commercial
centre
of
meccania
the
merchants
are
little
more
than
the
agents
for
the
distribution
of
goods
the
quantities
are
largely
fixed
by
the
department
of
industry
and
commerce
consequently
there
is
not
much
room
for
enterprise
except
in
effecting
economies
in
distribution
in
bargaining
with
the
government
as
to
the
kinds
of
goods
to
be
produced
and
in
discussing
with
manufacturers
matters
of
detail
as
to
patterns
and
styles
for
example
the
schools
of
art
produce
every
year
designs
for
cloth
for
women
dress
the
merchants
select
from
these
the
patterns
to
be
manufactured
there
is
little
excitement
in
a
merchant
career
most
of
the
clerks
seem
to
be
occupied
in
the
preparation
and
revision
of
catalogues
which
are
the
substitute
for
advertisements
no
new
article
can
be
produced
until
it
has
been
approved
by
the
improvements
section
of
the
department
of
industry
and
commerce
all
this
side
of
the
life
of
mecco
was
very
tame
and
stereotyped
prigge
discoursed
at
length
on
the
merits
of
the
post
office
and
all
its
works
but
the
only
remarkable
thing
i
noticed
about
it
besides
the
censorship
of
letters
and
the
enormous
number
of
people
employed
was
the
ingenious
arrangement
whereby
a
conversation
carried
on
in
any
part
of
meccania
could
be
overheard
at
the
central
office
the
absence
of
life
and
bustle
in
the
streets
was
as
striking
as
in
bridgetown
most
of
the
people
in
the
government
offices
belonged
to
the
fourth
class
and
as
these
all
lived
in
the
two
quarters
running
north
and
south
of
the
central
ring
they
could
reach
their
offices
in
a
very
short
time
the
midday
meal
was
taken
in
a
canteen
within
the
office
the
few
inferior
employees
messengers
porters
cleaners
who
belonged
to
the
fifth
or
sixth
class
lived
almost
as
near
the
higher
civil
servants
of
the
third
class
who
of
course
were
less
numerous
did
not
make
a
crowd
in
the
street
the
green
uniforms
of
the
fourth
class
were
the
most
conspicuous
object
everywhere
the
industrial
classes
living
as
they
do
on
the
side
nearest
the
industrial
town
are
transported
by
an
ingenious
system
of
trams
and
underground
and
overhead
railways
so
that
in
half
an
hour
they
can
all
get
from
their
homes
to
their
work
where
they
remain
all
day
all
goods
arriving
from
the
industrial
town
for
distribution
to
the
stores
are
carried
by
a
regular
service
of
the
distribution
of
goods
to
houses
is
so
systematised
as
to
require
comparatively
few
vehicles
for
instance
certain
kinds
of
goods
can
be
delivered
only
once
a
month
for
each
household
others
only
once
a
week
consequently
one
sees
a
perfectly
regular
stream
of
traffic
which
is
never
very
dense
and
never
congested
all
this
might
have
been
very
interesting
to
a
student
of
municipal
socialism
and
mechanical
organisation
but
my
chief
interests
lay
in
other
directions
and
it
was
not
until
we
came
to
the
cultural
institutions
that
i
found
things
so
remarkable
at
any
rate
from
my
own
point
of
view
that
i
shall
make
no
apology
for
describing
them
with
some
fullness
here
even
at
the
risk
of
being
tedious
to
those
who
think
more
of
locomotion
than
of
liberty
or
who
regard
the
post
office
as
the
highest
symbol
of
civilisation
i
had
looked
forward
with
some
curiosity
to
my
first
visit
to
a
meccanian
art
gallery
for
as
i
had
not
been
into
any
private
houses
and
as
there
are
no
shop
windows
i
had
seen
hardly
any
signs
of
meccanian
art
culture
except
in
architecture
the
decorative
work
in
the
public
buildings
did
not
impress
me
favourably
it
was
patriotic
art
executed
by
the
students
of
the
imperial
meccanian
academy
prigge
announced
that
as
he
had
been
promoted
to
a
higher
grade
in
the
police
service
he
would
no
longer
be
available
to
conduct
me
by
way
of
consoling
me
for
the
deprivation
he
said
that
in
any
case
i
should
have
to
be
handed
over
to
various
specialist
conductors
as
i
had
almost
completed
the
general
part
of
my
tour
and
had
reached
the
stage
when
i
should
have
to
begin
the
study
of
definite
branches
of
meccanian
culture
he
had
consequently
arranged
for
me
to
spend
the
first
three
days
in
the
great
meccanian
gallery
under
the
guidance
of
specialist
art
section
musch
musch
met
me
at
the
appointed
time
at
the
hotel
he
was
a
very
different
type
from
prigge
he
was
much
less
of
the
in
fact
he
looked
rather
if
a
meccanian
can
be
decadent
he
spoke
in
a
soft
voice
which
was
quite
a
contrast
to
the
leathery
voices
of
most
officials
i
had
encountered
previously
he
began
by
saying
that
before
we
actually
began
our
inspection
of
the
pictures
there
were
certain
preliminaries
the
great
meccanian
gallery
he
said
was
the
temple
of
all
that
was
sacred
in
the
æsthetic
world
i
must
be
properly
prepared
for
it
so
that
i
could
concentrate
my
attention
upon
what
i
saw
and
not
be
distracted
by
having
to
ask
questions
about
extraneous
matters
if
i
would
pay
careful
attention
he
would
describe
the
general
arrangements
the
great
meccanian
gallery
he
said
is
one
of
the
four
galleries
in
mecco
the
other
three
are
subsidiary
the
first
gallery
is
devoted
to
the
old
historical
collections
that
existed
before
the
time
of
prince
mechow
and
contains
only
foreign
pictures
the
second
gallery
contains
meccanian
pictures
of
a
date
previous
to
the
foundation
of
the
great
meccanian
gallery
by
prince
mechow
the
fourth
gallery
contains
foreign
pictures
contemporary
with
those
in
the
great
meccanian
gallery
and
now
we
come
to
the
great
meccanian
gallery
itself
every
picture
in
that
gallery
is
an
expression
of
the
meccanian
spirit
otherwise
it
is
not
admitted
its
technique
must
also
satisfy
the
board
of
art
of
the
department
of
culture
consequently
as
soon
as
you
enter
you
are
in
the
atmosphere
of
pure
meccanian
art
previous
to
the
creation
of
this
gallery
the
influence
of
art
was
rather
the
æsthetic
sense
was
cultivated
in
total
ignorance
of
the
possibility
of
marrying
it
to
the
meccanian
spirit
the
meccanian
spirit
is
the
active
creative
male
the
æsthetic
sense
is
receptive
conceptive
essentially
female
of
the
two
meccanian
art
is
born
he
went
on
in
this
style
for
several
minutes
until
i
thought
i
had
better
get
something
more
definite
from
him
for
my
so
i
said
how
does
one
tell
whether
a
picture
is
an
expression
of
the
meccanian
spirit
to
the
true
meccanian
all
things
truly
meccanian
are
sacred
and
by
the
inward
cultivation
of
the
sense
of
reverence
for
what
is
most
characteristically
meccanian
he
arrives
at
a
certainty
which
is
incommunicable
to
others
but
suppose
opinion
is
divided
suppose
for
example
one
man
says
here
is
a
picture
which
is
full
of
the
meccanian
spirit
and
another
man
says
the
contrary
musch
smiled
in
a
sad
superior
way
by
which
i
saw
that
after
all
in
spite
of
his
he
was
a
true
meccanian
you
are
evidently
not
well
acquainted
with
either
meccanian
history
or
philosophy
he
said
even
our
early
philosophers
taught
that
the
meccanian
spirit
must
embody
itself
in
institutions
or
it
would
evaporate
the
imperial
meccanian
academy
is
the
visible
embodiment
of
the
highest
manifestation
of
the
meccanian
æsthetic
spirit
all
meccanian
artists
are
trained
under
the
influence
of
the
academy
its
judgment
as
expressed
by
the
central
board
is
infallible
none
of
its
decisions
has
ever
been
reversed
i
do
not
think
you
realise
how
completely
the
influence
of
the
academy
has
moulded
the
meccanian
appreciation
of
art
during
the
last
generation
he
went
on
in
his
slow
soft
speech
you
have
heard
something
from
my
friend
dodderer
of
the
care
taken
by
our
in
the
cultivation
of
the
appreciation
of
the
drama
and
you
have
probably
heard
something
too
of
our
musical
culture
other
forms
of
art
are
equally
sacred
since
they
are
all
meccanian
every
person
in
the
fourth
and
higher
classes
goes
through
a
course
of
art
appreciation
which
extends
over
several
years
no
person
is
admitted
beyond
the
fifth
stage
of
the
great
meccanian
gallery
unless
he
has
passed
the
advanced
test
attendance
at
the
gallery
is
compulsory
once
a
fortnight
for
all
persons
of
the
fourth
and
third
classes
between
the
ages
of
fourteen
and
the
fifth
class
are
not
admitted
to
rooms
beyond
stage
except
by
special
permission
on
four
days
in
the
year
for
them
we
have
a
few
local
galleries
as
we
have
for
the
sixth
class
also
containing
pictures
which
are
soundly
meccanian
in
spirit
but
which
do
not
come
up
to
the
standard
of
the
great
gallery
presently
we
proceeded
to
the
gallery
containing
the
old
historical
collection
musch
said
that
we
should
see
what
we
wanted
of
this
in
an
hour
in
fact
it
was
rather
a
formality
to
visit
it
but
the
regulations
for
foreign
observers
made
it
necessary
that
i
should
see
this
first
it
turned
out
to
be
really
a
fine
collection
such
as
i
had
seen
in
many
others
parts
of
europe
but
i
almost
gasped
at
the
strange
freak
which
had
inspired
the
curators
in
arranging
the
pictures
they
were
arranged
strictly
according
to
subject
all
the
nativities
were
together
in
one
room
all
the
madonnas
together
in
another
all
the
adam
and
eves
together
all
the
deluges
all
the
susannas
all
the
prodigal
sons
all
the
venuses
all
the
bacchuses
whatever
the
subject
every
picture
relating
to
that
subject
was
placed
together
as
if
the
gallery
were
a
collection
of
butterflies
musch
took
no
interest
in
this
collection
it
was
all
dead
he
said
obsolete
untouched
by
the
spirit
when
we
came
to
the
second
gallery
containing
the
older
meccanian
pictures
he
showed
more
interest
some
painted
three
centuries
ago
i
thought
very
fine
but
musch
said
they
were
lacking
in
the
meccanian
spirit
was
overlaid
by
false
foreign
culture
only
when
we
came
to
some
weird
and
powerful
but
almost
revolting
pictures
dating
from
the
beginning
of
the
century
did
he
grow
enthusiastic
these
he
said
were
the
genuine
precursors
and
pioneers
of
meccanian
art
it
was
afternoon
when
we
entered
the
first
section
or
stage
of
the
great
meccanian
gallery
this
was
the
first
stage
for
young
persons
and
was
divided
into
a
section
containing
pictures
and
another
containing
historical
pictures
the
general
pictures
were
mostly
scenes
of
places
of
interest
in
various
parts
of
meccania
or
national
customs
and
public
ceremonies
the
technique
was
distinctly
good
the
historical
pictures
mostly
represented
wars
against
foreign
enemies
i
noticed
that
the
meccanians
were
represented
as
heroes
and
their
enemies
as
brutalised
hordes
of
others
represented
meccanians
discovering
all
the
arts
of
peace
and
war
i
spent
a
dreary
day
and
more
working
painfully
through
stages
ii
and
up
to
until
on
the
third
day
we
came
to
the
most
advanced
specimens
these
reminded
me
of
dodderer
account
of
the
meccanian
drama
there
was
a
number
of
allegorical
subjects
the
birth
of
the
meccanian
spirit
the
victory
of
time
over
space
the
festival
of
chemistry
the
nuptials
of
science
and
force
the
conquests
of
culture
others
were
more
mystical
war
the
servant
of
culture
the
deity
instructing
monarchy
the
eternal
principle
of
meccanian
monarchy
the
wisdom
of
the
the
unity
of
the
seven
classes
some
of
these
were
immense
canvases
forty
feet
long
full
of
figures
drawn
with
microscopic
exactness
the
artists
had
certainly
managed
to
catch
and
even
accentuate
the
meccanian
features
of
every
face
i
felt
the
meccanian
atmosphere
but
i
still
could
not
understand
why
such
careful
cultivation
should
have
been
required
to
produce
this
extraordinary
collection
i
would
gladly
have
given
the
whole
gallery
for
a
few
masterpieces
from
the
old
collection
i
could
not
imagine
that
any
effect
produced
on
the
mind
even
of
patriotic
meccanians
could
be
worth
all
the
trouble
spent
upon
either
the
creation
of
the
gallery
itself
or
the
organisation
of
artistic
culture
that
centred
round
it
i
was
therefore
curious
to
see
what
sort
of
effect
the
sight
of
the
pictures
had
upon
other
visitors
in
one
of
the
lower
rooms
i
had
seen
some
groups
of
schoolgirls
accompanied
by
a
teacher
they
all
had
their
notebooks
and
were
taking
down
notes
in
shorthand
musch
explained
enthusiastically
that
these
girls
would
spend
a
whole
afternoon
on
half
a
dozen
pictures
and
that
by
the
time
they
were
twenty
years
of
age
they
would
have
studied
every
picture
up
to
stage
xix
in
the
gallery
what
i
overheard
from
the
teacher
lecture
was
something
like
this
now
let
us
analyse
the
colour
scheme
by
the
aid
of
the
colour
divider
you
perceive
at
once
the
proportions
in
which
the
colours
are
distributed
now
notice
that
red
which
occupies
only
per
cent
of
the
canvas
is
more
conspicuous
than
green
which
occupies
more
than
per
cent
i
did
not
catch
the
next
passage
but
presently
i
heard
all
the
pictures
by
the
same
artist
have
the
same
distribution
of
colour
consequently
it
would
be
possible
to
determine
by
an
analysis
of
the
colour
scheme
the
authenticity
of
any
picture
by
this
artist
next
notice
the
method
of
the
brush
strokes
under
the
microscope
here
the
microscope
came
into
play
you
will
see
the
characteristic
quality
of
the
brush
stroke
it
has
been
already
ascertained
that
in
this
picture
there
are
of
an
average
length
of
millimetres
strokes
from
right
to
left
of
an
average
length
of
millimetre
only
from
left
to
right
and
upward
strokes
the
same
proportion
of
strokes
has
been
discovered
in
several
other
pictures
by
the
same
artist
according
to
the
size
of
the
picture
this
picture
was
painted
in
exactly
hours
the
quantity
of
paint
used
must
have
been
almost
exactly
of
a
litre
so
you
can
make
a
calculation
to
ascertain
the
number
of
brush
strokes
to
the
litre
in
another
gallery
i
noticed
some
superior
young
men
of
the
fourth
class
in
their
green
uniforms
discussing
the
merits
of
a
popular
artist
one
of
them
was
saying
and
i
maintain
that
his
morality
is
he
lacks
in
another
room
a
few
stolid
citizens
of
middle
age
were
slowly
making
a
pilgrimage
i
wondered
why
they
did
not
move
faster
and
get
it
over
until
i
discovered
there
was
a
rule
that
at
each
visit
were
not
allowed
to
spend
less
than
half
an
hour
in
one
room
or
more
than
of
an
hour
this
regulation
did
not
apply
to
me
so
long
as
i
was
under
the
charge
of
musch
who
had
access
to
the
whole
gallery
i
found
musch
a
less
desirable
acquaintance
than
prigge
i
suspected
him
of
being
addicted
to
drugs
and
wondered
how
far
his
enthusiasm
for
the
meccanian
spirit
was
an
official
pose
for
after
completing
my
visit
to
the
great
gallery
i
was
asking
him
whether
all
artists
were
employed
by
the
state
and
whether
there
were
not
other
types
of
pictures
produced
besides
those
represented
in
the
great
gallery
when
he
began
to
tell
me
of
another
phase
of
art
all
artists
he
said
who
in
the
seventh
year
of
their
training
are
accepted
by
the
academy
are
employed
permanently
by
the
state
the
others
are
found
other
employment
according
to
their
capacity
but
are
not
permitted
to
produce
pictures
i
suppose
i
said
the
artists
who
are
taken
into
the
service
of
the
state
are
controlled
in
some
way
what
happens
for
instance
if
they
turn
out
to
be
idlers
they
are
certainly
controlled
the
board
selects
the
subjects
for
the
year
for
each
artist
according
to
his
capacity
of
course
he
may
suggest
subjects
too
but
until
they
are
approved
he
is
not
allowed
to
proceed
he
must
also
submit
a
plan
or
sketch
of
his
proposed
treatment
and
is
a
painter
not
allowed
even
in
his
own
leisure
to
paint
subjects
of
his
own
choice
ah
there
you
touch
upon
an
interesting
subject
replied
musch
with
something
like
a
leer
the
board
are
naturally
desirous
of
preserving
the
meccanian
spirit
in
all
its
purity
but
the
effort
to
rise
to
the
sublime
heights
of
emotion
which
that
demands
produces
a
reaction
and
many
of
our
artists
find
an
outlet
for
this
so
that
beside
the
pure
stream
of
meccanian
art
there
flows
as
it
were
another
stream
in
other
words
i
suggested
they
carry
on
an
illicit
production
of
works
of
a
lower
ethical
quality
which
can
only
be
disposed
of
by
being
sold
to
the
rich
your
intuition
is
remarkable
he
replied
not
in
the
least
i
said
one
only
requires
a
little
knowledge
of
human
nature
to
see
what
must
happen
but
how
does
this
practice
escape
the
attention
of
the
i
said
there
are
many
patrons
of
art
among
the
higher
official
class
replied
musch
significantly
this
was
the
first
time
i
had
learnt
from
any
person
that
the
state
had
any
chinks
in
its
armour
perhaps
you
can
tell
me
i
said
something
which
has
puzzled
me
ever
since
i
came
here
and
that
is
why
your
occupies
itself
so
meticulously
with
such
things
as
music
and
the
drama
and
art
such
interests
seem
rather
foreign
to
the
main
purpose
for
which
as
i
understand
it
the
great
statesmen
who
have
made
meccania
what
it
is
designed
it
i
have
often
wondered
the
same
thing
myself
replied
musch
i
can
only
say
that
if
all
this
side
of
life
were
left
unregulated
the
life
of
the
state
would
be
incomplete
sooner
or
later
the
consciousness
of
the
state
must
embrace
all
things
i
said
no
more
and
this
was
the
last
i
saw
of
poor
musch
for
next
day
he
was
ill
and
i
was
taken
by
another
whose
name
was
grovel
to
see
the
mechow
memorial
museum
almost
everything
in
mecco
is
a
sort
of
memorial
or
reminder
of
prince
mechow
mechow
street
mechow
square
the
mechow
monument
mechow
park
the
mechow
palace
mechow
hotels
meet
one
at
every
turn
there
are
even
mechow
whiskers
of
a
pattern
seldom
seen
outside
meccania
but
immensely
popular
among
officials
of
the
third
and
fourth
classes
curiously
enough
i
learnt
that
the
higher
officials
rather
resent
the
wearing
of
this
style
of
whisker
by
subordinate
officials
but
as
it
is
a
sort
of
symbol
of
loyalty
it
is
not
considered
proper
to
repress
it
the
museum
is
near
the
square
and
is
the
largest
biographical
museum
in
existence
it
contains
a
model
of
the
house
prince
mechow
was
born
in
with
all
his
clothes
and
toys
all
the
schoolbooks
he
used
and
models
of
all
the
rooms
he
lived
in
including
his
bedrooms
one
room
contains
all
the
letters
he
wrote
all
the
letters
written
to
him
all
the
minutes
he
wrote
as
a
civil
servant
the
very
pens
he
used
the
office
furniture
etc
etc
the
library
contains
not
only
the
books
he
read
and
the
few
he
wrote
but
an
enormous
number
of
books
and
pamphlets
written
about
him
personally
and
about
all
his
work
besides
his
printed
speeches
which
run
into
many
volumes
there
are
phonographic
records
of
them
which
are
daily
in
a
special
hall
to
youths
and
girls
from
the
high
schools
one
large
room
contains
models
of
all
the
towns
in
meccania
as
they
were
before
his
reforms
and
as
they
are
now
another
room
is
devoted
to
the
great
monument
it
contains
the
original
plans
and
models
as
well
as
a
model
of
all
the
copies
erected
in
various
towns
adjoining
this
room
is
a
large
collection
of
photographs
of
prince
mechow
casts
of
his
face
and
waxwork
models
of
him
as
he
appeared
on
several
great
historical
occasions
one
case
in
the
library
struck
me
as
very
characteristic
it
was
a
series
of
volumes
in
folio
sumptuously
bound
the
first
was
entitled

there
were
at

chapter
vii
a
meccanian
apostle
it
was
a
week
or
two
after
my
visit
to
the
mechow
museum
that
i
made
the
acquaintance
of
one
of
the
foreign
observers
who
was
staying
at
the
hotel
a
day
or
two
before
i
had
been
sent
for
by
the
hotel
manager
and
had
been
presented
with
a
small
certificate
authorising
me
to
take
my
meals
in
the
common
and
to
converse
with
other
foreigners
whose
names
i
was
instructed
to
enter
in
my
diary
i
had
previously
noticed
a
certain
gentleman
from
luniland
whose
face
seemed
familiar
to
me
on
this
particular
evening
he
came
across
to
my
table
and
introduced
himself
as
johnson
a
friend
of
yorke
in
whose
house
i
had
stayed
and
where
he
had
met
me
we
soon
fell
into
conversation
and
when
dinner
was
over
we
retired
for
a
long
chat
to
a
corner
of
the
it
appeared
that
he
had
been
in
mecco
over
a
year
and
had
travelled
also
in
various
parts
of
the
country
in
fact
this
was
his
second
visit
he
said
his
first
having
been
made
a
few
years
before
he
was
a
man
of
about
tall
and
slim
with
a
rather
large
bony
nose
and
a
grave
but
kindly
expression
his
manner
was
quiet
and
dignified
and
at
first
he
spoke
with
a
certain
obvious
restraint
but
afterwards
he
became
more
genial
and
was
rather
humorous
after
the
manner
of
many
of
his
countrymen
i
should
rather
like
to
ask
what
you
think
of
this
country
but
it
would
hardly
be
fair
because
the
chances
are
that
every
word
we
say
here
is
overheard
i
always
suspect
they
have
one
of
those
beastly
contrivances
fixed
in
the
walls
to
enable
the
manager
or
somebody
representing
the
authorities
to
listen
to
everything
that
goes
on
i
do
much
mind
if
they
turn
me
out
of
their
precious
country
but
i
would
like
to
get
you
into
trouble
anyhow
i
believe
if
we
were
to
begin
talking
in
my
language
which
i
remember
you
speak
very
well
we
should
presently
have
somebody
round
reminding
us
that
it
is
against
the
rules
yet
you
have
spent
quite
a
long
time
in
the
country
apparently
i
remarked
i
have
really
been
wondering
whether
to
stay
here
much
longer
and
perhaps
you
could
give
me
some
tips
if
i
decide
to
stay
well
he
replied
it
just
a
matter
of
taste
whether
you
like
the
country
i
should
be
able
to
stand
it
but
for
one
thing
and
what
is
that
i
asked
it
enables
me
to
thank
god
every
hour
that
i
am
not
a
meccanian
yes
i
said
there
something
in
that
i
myself
object
to
some
of
the
inconveniences
that
these
numerous
regulations
about
everything
entail
but
they
are
nothing
i
suppose
compared
with
what
it
would
feel
like
if
one
expected
to
spend
one
life
here
it
just
possible
they
really
like
it
but
what
sort
of
were
you
thinking
of
perhaps
i
know
the
ropes
a
little
better
than
you
if
you
have
been
here
only
a
month
or
two
well
there
are
two
things
i
would
like
to
know
i
replied
i
am
rather
tired
of
being
about
everywhere
that
the
first
and
i
want
to
get
to
know
individual
people
as
i
did
in
luniland
here
so
far
i
have
met
only
officials
always
on
duty
it
seems
impossible
to
get
into
contact
with
real
live
people
until
lately
as
you
know
i
was
forbidden
to
talk
to
the
people
staying
in
the
hotel
but
now
that
i
have
got
over
that
difficulty
although
no
doubt
i
can
pick
up
a
certain
amount
of
information
from
my
fellow
foreign
observers
and
enjoy
their
conversation
i
am
no
nearer
getting
to
know
the
meccanian
private
citizens
themselves
and
do
you
particularly
want
to
know
them
asked
johnson
one
naturally
wants
to
know
what
the
people
of
any
country
are
like
and
unless
one
has
some
fairly
intimate
intercourse
of
a
social
kind
with
people
of
different
ranks
and
types
one
might
almost
as
well
stay
at
home
and
read
the
matter
up
in
books
i
replied
i
see
you
are
a
genuine
foreign
observer
well
to
tell
the
truth
so
am
i
he
said
more
confidentially
i
am
not
here
because
i
like
it
i
detest
the
whole
lot
of
them
i
came
here
for
the
first
time
five
or
six
years
ago
i
had
heard
a
lot
about
the
country
and
its
wonderful
organisation
organisation
blessed
word
i
had
also
heard
some
rather
tall
stories
and
thought
the
accounts
had
been
exaggerated
i
came
with
an
open
mind
i
rather
prided
myself
on
being
an
impartial
observer
i
was
prepared
to
allow
a
lot
for
the
natural
differences
of
taste
between
one
nation
and
another
at
first
i
was
so
keenly
interested
that
i
did
mind
the
little
restrictions
but
when
the
novelty
had
worn
off
and
i
began
to
realise
what
it
all
meant
i
determined
to
make
a
more
thorough
study
of
the
country
than
i
had
at
first
thought
would
be
worth
while
so
i
am
here
now
studying
meccanian
education
now
the
only
way
so
far
as
i
know
of
getting
rid
of
your
everlasting
is
to
get
permission
to
study
some
special
subject
i
went
through
just
the
same
experience
i
was
what
they
call
merely
a
observer
the
authorities
do
exactly
like
the
observer
they
ca
find
it
in
their
hearts
to
let
him
alone
as
they
regulate
their
own
people
they
must
keep
as
close
a
watch
on
the
foreigner
as
he
does
fit
into
their
system
they
have
to
invent
a
system
for
him
it
is
troublesome
to
them
and
not
very
pleasant
for
the
foreigner
but
meccanian
principles
make
it
necessary
however
if
you
can
satisfy
them
that
you
are
a
student
of
some
special
subject
it
does
matter
what
it
is
you
may
choose
anything
from
the
parasites
in
the
intestines
of
a
beetle
to
the
philosophy
of
the
absolute
they
will
treat
you
quite
decently
according
to
their
lights
how
do
you
account
for
this
difference
i
asked
they
are
immensely
flattered
by
the
notion
that
if
you
come
here
to
study
anything
it
must
be
because
their
knowledge
is
so
superior
to
what
can
be
found
elsewhere
however
if
you
want
to
get
rid
of
the
daily
worry
of
a
that
is
what
you
must
do
but
you
must
be
a
specialist
of
some
sort
or
they
wo
admit
you
to
the
privilege
but
there
is
no
special
subject
i
want
to
study
i
said
i
am
just
a
observer
and
if
i
undertake
to
study
a
special
subject
i
shall
miss
seeing
what
i
most
want
to
see
that
is
a
difficulty
perhaps
you
had
better
go
on
as
you
have
been
doing
and
when
you
have
had
enough
of
that
go
in
for
some
political
institutions
they
have
got
you
registered
as
a
national
councillor
so
you
can
pretend
to
study
the
working
of
the
constitution
or
some
such
thing
that
rather
a
good
idea
i
said
but
judging
from
what
i
have
seen
i
should
doubt
whether
they
will
let
me
see
what
i
want
to
see
why
what
do
you
want
to
see
just
what
i
can
not
get
from
an
inspection
of
the
machinery
of
the
state
the
effect
of
the
laws
and
customs
on
the
actual
life
of
the
people
ah
that
you
will
have
to
get
by
the
aid
of
your
imagination
but
i
suggested
is
it
not
possible
to
get
permission
to
live
in
some
family
or
with
several
different
families
in
different
classes
in
succession
oh
yes
replied
johnson
quite
possible
if
you
are
prepared
to
go
through
all
the
necessary
formalities
but
i
doubt
whether
you
will
get
much
by
it
you
see
each
family
is
a
sort
of
replica
in
miniature
of
the
state
they
will
have
to
report
to
the
police
once
a
week
upon
all
your
doings
every
word
you
say
will
be
listened
to
they
will
be
studying
you
just
as
you
will
be
studying
them
i
have
tried
it
there
no
natural
intercourse
in
this
country
try
it
if
you
like
but
i
am
sure
you
will
come
to
my
opinion
in
the
end
do
forget
to
enter
the
time
of
this
conversation
in
your
diary
johnson
said
as
we
parted
if
you
make
a
mistake
or
if
i
make
a
mistake
we
shall
have
an
interview
with
an
inspector
from
the
time
department
and
the
hotel
manager
will
worry
us
to
death
about
it
the
next
day
i
resumed
my
tour
of
observation
with
a
new
whose
name
was
lickrod
he
was
almost
affectionate
in
his
greeting
when
we
met
at
the
police
office
and
we
had
not
been
long
together
before
i
recognised
that
he
was
a
different
type
from
prigge
or
sheep
or
any
of
the
others
i
had
met
he
was
to
take
me
to
see
the
industrial
town
and
he
was
full
of
enthusiasm
for
everything
we
were
to
see
as
we
went
along
in
the
tram
he
explained
rather
effusively
that
it
was
a
great
pleasure
to
him
to
meet
foreigners
he
had
a
mission
in
life
just
as
meccania
had
a
mission
among
all
the
nations
he
was
a
loyal
meccanian
in
fact
he
yielded
to
no
man
in
his
loyalty
to
the
state
but
for
that
very
reason
he
ventured
to
criticise
one
defect
in
the
policy
of
the
government
i
began
to
wonder
what
that
could
be
i
have
travelled
abroad
he
said
and
i
have
seen
with
my
own
eyes
the
benighted
condition
of
so
many
millions
of
my
i
come
home
and
i
see
everywhere
around
me
order
knowledge
prosperity
cleanliness
no
dirt
no
poverty
no
disorder
no
strikes
no
disturbance
no
ignorance
no
disease
that
can
be
prevented
culture
everywhere
it
makes
me
almost
weep
to
think
of
the
state
of
the
world
outside
we
have
not
done
all
that
we
might
have
done
to
carry
our
culture
abroad
we
have
kept
it
too
much
to
ourselves
in
my
humble
way
as
a
conductor
of
foreigners
i
take
every
opportunity
i
can
of
spreading
a
knowledge
of
our
culture
but
instead
of
a
few
score
or
at
most
a
few
hundred
foreigners
every
year
we
ought
to
have
thousands
here
then
they
would
become
missionaries
in
their
own
countries
i
always
impress
upon
them
that
they
must
begin
with
the
reform
of
education
in
their
countries
and
i
would
advise
you
before
you
return
to
make
a
thorough
study
of
our
system
of
education
without
that
you
can
not
hope
to
succeed
but
i
suggested
if
other
countries
followed
your
example
would
they
not
become
as
strong
as
you
perhaps
your
government
looks
at
it
from
that
point
of
view
there
are
on
this
question
he
observed
sagely
two
opposite
opinions
one
is
that
it
is
better
to
keep
our
culture
to
ourselves
the
other
is
that
we
ought
to
teach
other
nations
so
that
ultimately
all
the
earth
can
become
one
great
and
glorious
meccania
by
this
time
we
had
arrived
at
the
entrance
to
the
industrial
town
conductor
lickrod
broke
off
to
note
the
time
of
our
arrival
and
to
lead
me
into
the
office
of
the
governor
or
controller
of
what
for
convenience
i
may
call
worktown
indeed
the
industrial
quarter
is
known
by
a
similar
term
in
mecco
this
controller
is
responsible
for
the
preservation
of
order
but
as
there
is
no
difficulty
about
discipline
in
the
ordinary
sense
of
the
word
his
functions
are
rather
to
promote
a
high
standard
of
meccanian
conduct
among
the
workers
of
all
ages
and
grades
in
this
work
he
is
assisted
by
scores
of
of
industrial
training
as
they
are
called
the
organisation
of
the
controller
department
was
explained
before
we
proceeded
to
any
of
the
works
there
was
a
large
room
filled
with
thousands
of
little
dossiers
in
shelves
and
cases
to
correspond
the
particulars
of
the
character
and
career
of
every
worker
in
the
town
could
be
ascertained
at
a
moment
notice
all
the
workers
were
either
in
the
fifth
or
sixth
class
but
they
were
divided
into
more
than
a
dozen
subgrades
and
the
showed
by
the
colour
which
of
the
many
grades
any
particular
person
had
attained
i
asked
how
the
workmen
were
engaged
the
industrial
career
of
a
workman
said
lickrod
enthusiastically
begins
if
i
may
so
express
myself
with
the
dawn
of
his
industrial
intelligence
in
our
schools
and
here
you
perceive
one
of
the
perfections
of
our
educational
system
our
teachers
are
trained
to
detect
the
signs
of
the
innate
capacity
of
each
child
and
to
classify
it
appropriately
in
per
cent
of
cases
as
you
will
see
from
the
last
report
of
the
industrial
training
section
of
the
department
of
industry
and
commerce
the
careers
of
boys
are
determined
before
the
age
of
thirteen
the
rest
is
merely
a
question
of
training
by
a
proper
classification
we
are
able
to
adjust
the
supply
of
each
different
kind
of
capacity
to
the
requirements
of
our
industry
we
avoid
all
the
waste
and
uncertainty
which
one
sees
in
countries
where
even
the
least
competent
workmen
are
allowed
to
choose
their
employment
we
guarantee
employment
to
everybody
and
on
the
other
hand
we
preserve
the
right
to
say
what
the
employment
shall
be
does
that
mean
i
asked
that
a
workman
can
never
change
his
employment
in
some
of
the
more
backward
parts
of
the
country
it
is
sometimes
necessary
for
workmen
to
change
their
employment
but
here
in
mecco
we
should
think
we
had
managed
our
business
very
badly
if
that
were
necessary
but
without
its
being
necessary
a
man
might
wish
to
change
i
have
heard
of
many
cases
in
luniland
and
transatlantica
of
a
clever
and
enterprising
man
having
risen
to
eminence
after
an
experience
in
half
a
dozen
different
occupations
here
i
understand
that
is
impossible
ah
replied
lickrod
i
see
you
have
not
grasped
the
scientific
basis
of
our
system
you
say
such
and
such
a
person
rose
to
eminence
shall
we
say
as
a
lawyer
after
having
been
let
us
say
a
printer
or
even
a
if
there
had
been
a
sufficient
supply
of
good
lawyers
it
is
probable
that
he
would
not
have
succeeded
in
becoming
an
eminent
lawyer
now
know
our
requirements
as
regards
lawyers
just
as
we
know
our
requirements
as
to
engineers
we
have
also
the
means
of
judging
the
capacity
of
our
young
people
and
we
place
them
in
the
sphere
in
which
they
can
be
of
most
service
i
thought
i
could
see
holes
in
this
theory
but
all
i
said
was
so
you
think
of
the
problem
from
the
point
of
view
of
the
good
of
the
state
regardless
of
the
wishes
of
the
individual
certainly
of
the
good
of
the
state
but
you
mistake
the
true
meaning
of
the
wishes
of
the
individual
the
apparent
wish
of
the
individual
may
be
to
follow
some
other
course
than
that
which
the
state
with
its
fuller
knowledge
and
deeper
wisdom
directs
but
the
real
inward
wish
of
all
meccanians
is
to
serve
the
interests
of
meccania
that
is
the
outcome
of
our
system
of
education
we
must
talk
about
that
some
other
time
but
just
now
i
want
you
to
see
that
our
system
produces
such
wonderful
fruits
that
it
never
enters
the
head
of
any
meccanian
workman
to
question
its
wisdom
we
entered
a
gigantic
engineering
works
full
of
thousands
of
machine
tools
everything
appeared
as
clean
and
orderly
as
in
the
experimental
room
of
an
engineering
college
some
of
the
workmen
wore
overalls
showing
that
they
belonged
to
the
sixth
class
but
most
of
them
wore
the
chocolate
uniform
of
the
men
of
the
fifth
class
these
were
evidently
performing
highly
skilled
work
even
the
moulding
shops
were
clean
and
tidy
and
the
employment
of
machinery
for
doing
work
that
elsewhere
i
had
been
accustomed
to
see
done
by
hand
astonished
me
the
workmen
looked
like
soldiers
and
behaved
like
automatons
conversation
went
on
but
i
was
informed
by
lickrod
again
in
a
tone
of
pride
that
only
conversation
relative
to
the
work
in
hand
was
permitted
here
and
there
i
saw
a
man
in
a
green
uniform
applying
some
mysterious
instrument
to
one
of
the
workmen
i
asked
lickrod
what
this
meant
that
is
one
of
our
industrial
psychologists
testing
the
effects
of
certain
operations
by
this
means
we
can
tell
not
only
when
a
workman
is
but
also
if
he
is
it
is
all
part
of
our
science
of
production
what
happens
if
a
man
is
persistently
i
asked
he
will
have
to
perform
fatigue
duty
after
the
usual
hours
just
as
he
would
in
the
army
he
answered
and
do
they
not
object
to
this
who
the
workmen
why
should
they
the
man
who
is
guilty
of
knows
that
he
is
justly
punished
the
others
regard
the
offence
as
one
against
themselves
it
is
part
of
our
industrial
training
but
we
have
indeed
very
few
cases
of
in
mecco
you
know
perhaps
that
all
our
citizens
are
so
to
speak
selected
anyone
who
does
not
appreciate
his
privileges
can
be
removed
to
other
cities
or
towns
and
there
are
thousands
of
loyal
meccanians
only
too
eager
to
come
to
live
in
mecco
one
of
the
most
remarkable
industries
i
saw
carried
on
was
the
industry
the
plans
for
houses
of
every
kind
except
those
for
the
third
and
higher
classes
are
stereotyped
that
is
to
say
there
are
some
forty
or
fifty
different
plans
all
worked
out
to
the
minutest
detail
suppose
ten
houses
are
wanted
in
any
particular
quarter
the
building
department
decides
the
type
of
house
the
order
is
given
for
ten
houses
type
no
let
us
say
this
goes
to
the
firm
which
specialises
in
type
no
there
are
no
architect
fees
and
the
expenses
of
superintending
the
work
are
almost
i
asked
conductor
lickrod
why
it
was
that
when
the
whole
industry
of
had
been
reduced
to
a
matter
of
routine
the
state
did
not
itself
carry
on
the
work
but
employed
private
firms
that
question
he
said
touches
one
of
the
fundamental
principles
of
our
meccanian
policy
if
you
study
our
national
economy
you
will
learn
all
you
require
about
it
but
for
the
moment
i
may
say
that
the
control
of
the
state
over
industry
is
complete
yet
we
have
not
extinguished
the
capitalist
we
do
not
desire
to
do
so
for
many
reasons
the
third
class
which
includes
all
the
large
capitalists
and
the
fourth
class
which
includes
the
smaller
capitalists
furnish
a
most
important
element
in
the
national
economy
their
enterprise
in
business
and
manufacture
is
truly
astonishing
but
what
motive
have
they
for
displaying
enterprise
i
asked
what
motive
why
every
motive
their
livelihood
depends
upon
the
profits
made
their
promotion
to
a
higher
grade
in
their
own
class
and
in
the
case
of
those
in
the
fourth
class
their
promotion
to
the
ranks
of
the
third
class
also
depends
upon
their
skill
and
enterprise
but
most
of
all
the
meccanian
spirit
which
has
been
inculcated
by
our
system
of
education
inspires
them
with
the
desire
to
excel
the
business
men
of
all
other
nations
for
the
sake
of
meccanian
culture
certainly
the
organisation
of
industry
was
marvellous
and
the
production
of
everything
must
be
enormous
we
spent
three
days
going
through
factory
after
factory
there
was
the
same
marvellous
order
and
cleanliness
and
perfect
discipline
wherever
one
turned
on
leaving
the
works
the
men
all
marched
in
step
as
if
on
parade
inside
they
saluted
their
but
the
salute
was
of
a
special
kind
the
hand
was
raised
to
the
shoulder
only
so
as
to
avoid
a
sweeping
motion
which
might
have
brought
it
in
contact
with
some
object
one
of
the
triumphs
of
organisation
to
which
lickrod
called
my
attention
was
the
arrangement
whereby
the
workmen
reached
their
work
at
the
proper
time
got
their
midday
meal
and
reached
home
in
the
evening
without
any
congestion
each
separate
workshop
had
its
appointed
time
for
beginning
work
some
began
as
early
as
others
at
the
last
to
begin
were
a
few
that
had
a
comparatively
short
day
starting
at
the
midday
meal
began
at
and
was
taken
by
relays
until
about
all
the
women
employed
in
the
canteens
were
the
wives
and
daughters
of
workmen
who
spent
the
rest
of
their
time
in
household
work
at
home
at
the
end
of
the
third
day
as
i
was
taking
coffee
with
conductor
lickrod
i
took
advantage
of
his
communicativeness
which
was
rather
a
contrast
to
the
brusqueness
of
prigge
to
get
some
light
on
several
matters
that
had
so
far
puzzled
me
your
industrial
system
i
remarked
as
a
productive
machine
appears
to
me
to
be
quite
marvellous
lickrod
beamed
i
knew
you
would
think
so
he
said
we
have
a
word
in
our
language
which
so
far
as
i
am
aware
has
no
exact
equivalent
in
other
languages
because
their
culture
does
not
include
the
thing
it
means
adaptation
of
the
means
to
the
end
our
industrial
system
exemplifies
the
virtue
connoted
by
that
expression
but
our
whole
industrial
system
itself
is
only
a
means
perfectly
adapted
to
its
end
we
have
no
problem
in
the
old
sense
of
that
word
of
course
we
are
always
effecting
improvements
in
detail
but
i
have
been
wondering
how
it
is
i
said
that
with
all
this
marvellous
efficiency
in
production
your
workmen
in
the
fifth
and
sixth
and
i
suppose
in
the
seventh
class
also
appear
to
work
as
long
as
those
in
other
countries
they
do
not
appear
to
be
richer
and
they
seem
to
have
fewer
opportunities
of
rising
in
the
social
scale
i
have
heard
the
same
question
put
by
other
foreign
observers
replied
lickrod
and
i
am
glad
you
have
come
to
me
for
information
on
the
subject
a
complete
answer
involves
a
correct
understanding
of
our
whole
culture
to
begin
with
the
supreme
good
of
the
state
can
only
be
determined
by
the
state
itself
the
wishes
or
opinions
of
the
private
individual
are
of
no
account
now
the
state
knows
what
its
requirements
are
and
determines
the
amounts
and
kinds
of
work
necessary
to
meet
these
requirements
by
means
of
our
sociological
department
our
industrial
department
our
time
department
and
the
various
sections
of
our
department
of
culture
we
know
perfectly
how
to
adjust
our
industries
to
the
end
determined
by
the
state
every
class
and
grade
therefore
is
required
to
contribute
towards
the
supreme
good
of
the
state
according
to
its
ability
i
quite
understand
i
interrupted
the
point
of
view
you
are
expounding
but
what
i
am
wondering
is
why
with
all
this
efficient
machinery
of
production
everybody
in
the
country
is
not
in
the
enjoyment
either
of
wealth
or
of
leisure
i
am
afraid
it
is
not
easy
for
a
foreigner
without
longer
experience
to
appreciate
the
different
value
we
attach
to
things
such
as
wealth
and
leisure
and
other
things
too
suppose
purely
for
the
sake
of
argument
that
our
working
class
worked
only
five
hours
a
day
instead
of
nine
or
ten
what
would
they
do
with
their
leisure
i
suppose
they
would
enjoy
themselves
i
replied
and
seeing
that
they
have
had
the
benefit
of
a
good
education
i
take
it
that
they
would
know
how
to
enjoy
themselves
in
a
decent
manner
besides
your
regulations
would
be
able
to
prevent
any
excesses
or
disorders
and
you
think
they
would
be
better
employed
in
enjoying
themselves
than
in
serving
the
state
as
they
do
now
asked
lickrod
who
is
to
judge
whether
they
would
be
better
employed
i
answered
that
is
just
the
question
said
lickrod
and
it
is
there
that
our
culture
is
so
much
in
advance
of
other
nations
private
enjoyment
is
not
the
supreme
end
of
the
state
but
surely
i
said
you
do
not
go
on
producing
wealth
simply
for
the
sake
of
keeping
your
working
classes
employed
ten
hours
instead
of
five
what
becomes
of
the
wealth
as
i
said
before
we
produce
just
the
wealth
we
require
then
i
confess
i
am
baffled
i
said
possibly
a
great
deal
is
required
for
your
army
and
navy
and
other
public
services
you
have
you
must
acknowledge
a
very
large
number
of
people
employed
as
officials
of
all
kinds
as
these
are
not
producing
material
goods
perhaps
the
surplus
wealth
is
drained
away
into
these
channels
all
that
is
included
in
my
statement
that
we
produce
what
we
require
answered
lickrod
can
you
give
me
any
idea
i
asked
with
some
hesitation
fearing
i
was
getting
on
delicate
ground
how
much
of
the
industrial
product
is
required
for
military
and
naval
purposes
i
do
suppose
you
can
because
i
am
aware
that
your
government
does
not
publish
its
military
estimates
and
even
if
it
did
it
would
not
be
possible
to
tell
how
much
of
the
labour
of
the
working
classes
is
absorbed
in
that
way
but
whilst
i
do
not
ask
for
any
information
that
it
is
not
usual
to
give
i
suggest
to
you
that
when
i
see
the
extraordinary
productivity
of
your
economic
machine
coupled
with
the
comparative
simplicity
of
the
mode
of
life
pursued
by
the
bulk
of
your
population
i
am
bound
to
infer
one
of
two
things
either
a
vast
amount
must
be
absorbed
by
some
rich
class
or
it
must
be
in
some
way
absorbed
by
the
state
itself
i
think
your
reasoning
is
perfectly
sound
replied
lickrod
i
could
not
tell
you
what
proportion
of
the
wealth
product
is
absorbed
by
the
army
if
i
wished
for
i
do
not
know
and
nobody
in
meccania
knows
except
the
supreme
authority
the
finance
department
knows
only
in
terms
of
money
what
is
spent
upon
the
various
services
but
without
knowing
either
exact
amounts
or
proportions
i
have
no
hesitation
in
saying
that
a
very
great
deal
of
the
wealth
product
does
go
in
these
directions
but
that
is
part
of
our
meccanian
ideal
the
army
is
the
nation
is
it
not
every
workman
you
have
seen
is
a
soldier
and
he
is
a
soldier
just
as
much
when
he
is
in
the
factory
as
when
he
is
in
the
camp
or
the
barracks
he
spends
five
years
of
his
life
between
twenty
and
thirty
in
the
camp
and
he
spends
from
one
to
two
months
of
every
year
afterwards
in
keeping
up
his
training
then
of
course
there
is
the
equipment
of
both
army
and
navy
which
of
course
is
always
developing
your
idea
is
i
suppose
that
if
we
devoted
less
to
such
objects
as
these
the
people
of
the
working
classes
or
even
the
whole
body
of
people
would
have
more
to
spend
upon
pleasure
or
could
enjoy
more
leisure
yes
i
said
in
most
other
countries
every
penny
spent
upon
either
military
purposes
or
upon
state
officials
beyond
what
is
strictly
necessary
is
grudged
the
people
scrutinise
very
keenly
all
public
expenditure
they
prefer
to
spend
what
they
regard
as
their
own
money
in
their
own
way
it
seems
to
me
therefore
that
either
your
people
do
not
look
at
the
matter
in
the
same
way
or
if
they
do
that
the
state
has
discovered
a
very
effective
way
of
overcoming
their
objections
what
you
say
replied
lickrod
only
brings
out
more
and
more
the
difference
between
our
culture
and
that
of
other
nations
this
sense
of
antagonism
between
the
interests
of
the
individual
and
the
interests
of
the
state
which
has
hindered
and
apparently
still
hinders
the
development
of
other
countries
has
been
almost
entirely
eradicated
among
the
meccanians
what
i
said
do
you
mean
that
a
meccanian
pays
his
taxes
cheerfully
what
taxes
asked
lickrod
blandly
i
do
not
know
in
what
form
your
taxes
are
paid
i
said
but
they
must
be
paid
in
some
way
and
i
suspect
that
even
in
meccania
if
they
were
left
to
voluntary
subscription
the
exchequer
would
not
be
quite
so
full
now
that
is
a
very
curious
instance
of
what
i
am
tempted
to
call
the
political
stupidity
of
other
nations
instead
of
removing
all
circumstances
that
provoke
a
consciousness
of
difference
between
the
individual
and
the
state
they
seem
to
call
the
attention
of
the
private
citizen
as
they
call
him
to
these
differences
they
first
allow
a
man
to
regard
property
as
entirely
his
own
and
then
discuss
with
him
how
much
he
shall
contribute
and
finally
make
him
pay
in
hard
cash
and
how
do
you
manage
to
get
over
the
difficulty
i
said
all
meccanians
are
taught
from
their
youth
even
from
early
childhood
that
all
they
have
they
owe
to
the
beneficent
protection
of
the
state
the
state
is
their
father
and
their
mother
no
one
questions
its
benevolence
or
its
wisdom
or
its
power
consequently
all
this
haggling
about
how
much
shall
be
paid
this
year
or
that
year
is
avoided
the
state
is
the
direct
paymaster
of
nearly
half
the
nation
hence
it
can
deduct
what
is
due
without
any
sense
of
loss
through
our
banking
system
the
collection
of
the
rest
is
quite
easy
the
private
employers
deduct
from
the
wages
of
their
employees
and
are
charged
the
exact
amount
through
the
banks
no
one
feels
it
but
does
your
parliament
exercise
no
control
over
taxation
i
asked
in
some
surprise
our
parliament
is
in
such
complete
accord
with
the
government
that
it
would
not
dream
of
disturbing
the
system
of
taxation
which
has
worked
so
well
for
over
thirty
years
replied
lickrod
have
they
the
power
to
do
so
i
asked
they
have
the
power
to
ask
questions
certainly
he
replied
but
the
taxes
are
fixed
for
periods
of
seven
years
that
is
to
say
the
direct
taxes
falling
upon
each
separate
class
are
fixed
every
seven
years
in
each
case
so
that
the
taxes
for
the
first
class
come
up
for
revision
one
year
those
for
the
second
class
the
next
year
and
so
on
the
constitution
does
not
allow
parliament
to
increase
the
amount
asked
for
by
the
government
and
as
the
vote
is
taken
not
individually
but
by
classes
it
is
hardly
to
the
interest
of
any
of
the
classes
to
try
to
reduce
the
amount
assessed
upon
any
one
class
besides
the
government
derives
a
considerable
proportion
of
its
income
from
its
own
property
in
the
shape
of
mines
railways
forests
farms
and
so
forth
when
we
hear
foreigners
speak
of
parliamentary
opposition
we
hardly
know
what
the
term
means
it
is
entirely
foreign
to
the
meccanian
spirit
you
speak
of
the
government
i
remarked
but
i
have
not
yet
discovered
what
the
government
is
i
am
afraid
i
must
refer
you
to
our
manuals
of
constitutional
law
replied
lickrod
oh
i
know
in
a
general
way
the
outline
of
your
constitution
i
said
but
in
every
country
there
is
a
real
working
constitution
which
differs
from
the
formal
constitution
for
instance
constitutions
usually
contain
nothing
about
political
parties
yet
the
policy
and
traditions
of
these
parties
are
the
most
important
factors
the
merely
legal
powers
of
a
monarch
for
instance
may
in
practice
lapse
or
may
be
so
rarely
exercised
as
not
to
matter
now
in
meccania
one
sees
a
powerful
government
at
work
everywhere
that
is
one
sees
the
machinery
of
government
but
the
driving
force
and
the
controlling
force
seem
hidden
you
may
find
the
answer
to
your
question
if
you
make
a
study
of
our
political
institutions
at
present
i
am
afraid
your
curiosity
seems
directed
towards
matters
that
to
us
have
only
a
sort
of
historical
interest
it
would
never
occur
to
any
meccanian
to
ask
who
controls
the
government
his
conception
of
the
state
is
so
entirely
different
that
the
question
seems
almost
unmeaning
i
have
recently
spent
a
long
time
in
luniland
i
remarked
at
this
point
and
i
am
afraid
a
lunilander
would
say
that
if
such
a
question
has
become
unmeaning
to
a
meccanian
the
meccanians
must
have
lost
the
political
sense
and
we
should
say
that
we
have
solved
the
problem
of
politics
we
should
say
he
went
on
that
the
lunilanders
have
no
government
a
government
that
can
be
changed
every
few
years
a
government
that
has
to
ask
the
consent
of
what
they
call
the
taxpayers
for
every
penny
it
is
to
spend
a
government
that
must
expose
all
its
business
to
an
ignorant
mob
a
government
that
must
pass
and
carry
out
any
law
demanded
by
a
mere
majority
we
do
not
call
that
a
government
they
regard
liberty
as
more
important
than
government
i
replied
with
a
smile
they
are
still
enslaved
by
the
superstitions
of
the
eighteenth
and
nineteenth
centuries
he
replied
solemnly
no
nation
will
make
real
progress
until
it
learns
how
to
embody
its
physical
intellectual
and
spiritual
forces
in
an
state
our
state
may
be
imperfect
i
know
it
is
but
we
are
in
the
right
way
and
developed
as
it
may
be
in
another
century
it
will
completely
answer
all
human
requirements
developed
i
said
almost
betraying
my
amusement
for
i
wondered
what
further
developments
the
was
capable
of
in
what
directions
do
you
anticipate
development
there
is
still
an
immense
fund
of
religious
sentiment
that
is
squandered
upon
unworthy
objects
this
may
be
i
feel
sure
it
will
be
directed
into
a
nobler
channel
our
ritual
too
in
no
way
corresponds
to
the
sublimity
of
the
idea
of
the
the
ritual
of
the
catholic
church
which
is
after
all
but
a
section
of
the
whole
state
is
still
superior
from
the
sensuous
and
the
artistic
point
of
view
to
our
state
ritual
our
reverence
for
the
state
is
too
cold
too
inarticulate
i
have
sometimes
thought
that
the
emperor
might
found
an
order
of
priests
or
monks
who
would
cultivate
an
inward
devotion
that
would
inevitably
give
birth
to
a
real
religion
of
the
state
you
are
a
true
missionary
i
said
in
fact
i
think
you
are
entitled
to
be
considered
a
meccanian
apostle
i
have
learnt
a
great
deal
from
our
intercourse
and
just
as
you
have
suggested
that
the
government
might
bring
more
foreigners
to
see
the
wonders
of
your
meccanian
culture
i
would
suggest
that
they
should
send
you
and
others
like
yourself
into
other
countries
to
enlighten
them
as
to
the
real
mission
of
meccania
he
was
pleased
to
accept
this
testimony
from
an
innocent
and
foreign
observer
and
said
that
i
could
best
show
my
appreciation
by
inducing
more
of
my
to
come
and
study
the
wonders
of
meccanian
culture
chapter
viii
the
mechow
festival
i
told
johnson
of
this
conversation
when
next
we
met
and
he
seemed
immensely
amused
by
it
you
will
have
a
chance
of
seeing
a
bit
of
meccanian
ritual
he
said
you
mean
this
prince
mechow
festival
i
replied
what
is
it
like
i
suppose
you
have
seen
it
before
have
you
noticed
the
whole
town
is
crowded
with
visitors
he
said
but
i
wo
take
the
edge
off
by
telling
you
anything
about
it
you
shall
see
it
for
yourself
without
prejudice
i
was
aroused
about
five
next
morning
by
a
tremendous
booming
of
guns
it
lasted
for
half
an
hour
and
sounded
like
a
bombardment
then
for
the
next
all
the
bells
in
mecco
began
ringing
by
this
time
i
was
dressed
and
out
on
the
veranda
of
the
hotel
i
had
tried
to
go
outside
the
hotel
but
was
reminded
by
the
porter
that
we
were
instructed
to
remain
indoors
until
we
were
taken
to
a
building
in
the
great
square
to
watch
the
proceedings
at
a
few
minutes
after
six
we
were
conveyed
in
a
to
one
of
the
hotels
in
the
square
and
provided
with
seats
at
the
windows
there
were
only
about
twenty
foreign
observers
in
mecco
altogether
and
as
most
of
them
were
not
very
desirable
acquaintances
i
sought
the
company
of
johnson
the
streets
were
rapidly
filling
with
people
the
great
majority
being
dressed
in
grey
and
chocolate
uniforms
with
a
fair
sprinkling
of
green
there
were
also
quite
a
number
of
dark
blue
uniforms
as
there
is
no
seventh
class
in
mecco
i
pointed
this
out
to
johnson
who
said
that
all
the
people
in
the
streets
were
from
the
provinces
you
will
see
the
citizens
of
mecco
presently
he
said
where
have
they
lodged
all
these
people
i
asked
for
i
knew
the
hotels
would
not
hold
them
oh
every
person
is
billeted
upon
somebody
of
his
own
class
as
far
as
possible
some
of
them
have
relatives
here
at
seven
about
fifty
bands
of
music
struck
up
in
different
parts
of
the
great
central
circle
they
all
played
the
same
tunes
and
kept
wonderful
time
as
soon
as
they
struck
up
johnson
said
that
means
the
processions
have
started
we
waited
about
a
quarter
of
an
hour
the
square
itself
was
quite
clear
of
people
but
a
few
sentries
in
brilliant
uniforms
stood
guarding
the
entrances
from
the
four
streets
that
led
into
it
the
great
statue
towered
above
everything
presently
headed
by
a
band
the
first
of
the
processions
composed
of
members
of
the
sixth
class
in
their
best
grey
uniforms
with
all
their
badges
and
stripes
reached
the
square
six
men
at
the
head
carried
a
great
banner
and
were
followed
by
another
six
carrying
an
enormous
wreath
which
they
deposited
at
the
foot
of
the
statue
then
as
the
procession
moved
on
across
the
square
six
abreast
the
two
outside
files
left
the
procession
and
separating
one
to
the
right
the
other
to
the
left
filled
up
the
back
of
the
whole
square
four
deep
how
many
men
there
were
altogether
of
the
sixth
class
i
have
no
idea
but
they
took
half
an
hour
to
file
past
then
followed
another
still
bigger
procession
of
the
fifth
class
these
performed
a
similar
ceremony
and
proceeded
to
fill
up
the
square
ten
deep
after
them
came
the
fourth
class
in
their
green
uniforms
this
procession
was
much
more
brilliant
in
appearance
than
even
the
fifth
class
in
its
bright
chocolate
uniform
there
were
apparently
ten
grades
of
the
fourth
class
including
as
it
does
nearly
all
the
professional
men
as
well
as
officials
and
business
men
some
of
the
men
in
the
first
two
grades
had
their
breasts
almost
covered
with
badges
and
decorations
last
came
a
much
smaller
procession
of
the
third
class
the
yellow
against
the
background
of
green
and
chocolate
and
grey
as
they
filed
into
the
square
filling
the
inner
part
about
four
deep
made
a
brilliant
colour
effect
there
were
no
women
in
the
processions
but
the
buildings
in
the
square
were
full
of
the
wives
and
daughters
of
the
men
of
the
upper
classes
who
watched
the
proceedings
from
the
open
windows
and
balconies
the
bands
went
on
playing
all
the
time
the
processions
were
moving
in
and
filling
up
the
square
it
must
have
been
nine
when
the
music
suddenly
stopped
there
was
silence
for
five
minutes
then
suddenly
the
guns
burst
forth
again
and
for
a
quarter
of
an
hour
the
noise
was
deafening
then
the
bells
rang
for
half
an
hour
but
after
the
guns
they
sounded
like
a
mere
tinkling
at
ten
after
a
short
silence
a
subdued
kind
of
murmur
went
through
the
crowd
and
we
saw
advancing
from
the
imperial
church
which
stands
back
from
one
side
of
the
square
a
new
procession
this
time
in
military
uniforms
they
seemed
to
be
arranged
in
companies
of
about
fifty
and
there
must
have
been
a
hundred
companies
they
were
all
on
foot
as
it
would
have
been
very
inconvenient
to
have
cavalry
in
the
crowded
square
they
filled
up
the
central
space
immediately
after
came
a
group
of
about
fifty
generals
all
belonging
to
the
army
council
they
were
followed
by
the
members
of
the
imperial
council
all
dressed
in
generals
uniforms
then
came
the
emperor
himself
followed
by
the
prime
minister
and
some
of
the
chief
officials
of
the
state
i
could
not
see
the
face
of
the
emperor
from
where
i
stood
he
was
dressed
in
the
most
gorgeous
sort
of
uniform
i
have
ever
seen
and
as
he
appeared
at
a
given
signal
which
i
did
see
a
great
shout
went
up
from
all
the
people
present
hail
the
emperor
hail
the
emperor
hail
the
emperor
then
everybody
knelt
on
one
knee
for
about
half
a
minute
whilst
he
uttered
some
kind
of
blessing
which
i
could
not
hear
the
bands
then
struck
up
the
national
hymn
after
which
there
was
complete
silence
for
a
minute
or
two
suddenly
a
loud
voice
was
heard
it
must
have
been
produced
by
a
kind
of
megaphone
but
it
was
perfectly
clear
we
were
listening
to
the
emperor
formal
speech
on
the
occasion
i
have
not
the
exact
words
but
as
near
as
i
can
reproduce
it
the
speech
was
something
like
this
we
meet
for
the
sixteenth
time
since
the
death
of
the
illustrious
prince
mechow
to
commemorate
his
services
and
to
thank
god
for
the
blessings
which
through
the
divinely
appointed
instrumentality
of
that
noble
statesman
he
has
so
abundantly
bestowed
upon
this
his
most
beloved
country
superior
to
all
other
nations
and
races
in
our
endowments
we
had
not
achieved
those
triumphs
of
culture
of
which
our
noble
race
and
nation
was
capable
until
by
god
grace
my
father
minister
prince
mechow
showed
my
people
of
all
ranks
and
classes
how
to
direct
their
efforts
through
discipline
and
knowledge
and
devotion
to
the
strengthening
and
glorifying
of
our
divinely
founded
state
we
again
show
our
gratitude
to
god
for
having
raised
up
in
the
direct
succession
of
great
servants
of
the
state
one
who
knew
how
to
serve
his
emperor
and
his
god
and
thus
to
defeat
the
evil
intentions
of
all
the
host
of
envious
and
malignant
enemies
enemies
to
god
as
well
as
to
our
nation
by
whom
we
are
surrounded
let
those
enemies
beware
how
they
set
god
at
defiance
by
thwarting
the
divine
mission
he
has
entrusted
to
us
he
has
set
our
glorious
and
invincible
state
in
the
midst
of
all
the
nations
but
in
their
blindness
and
ignorance
they
have
scorned
our
mission
if
whilst
all
other
nations
are
striving
within
themselves
class
against
class
and
man
against
man
and
rulers
against
ruled
in
our
nation
and
among
my
people
there
is
but
one
will
one
purpose
one
mind
we
owe
it
under
god
more
to
prince
mechow
than
to
any
other
this
monument
which
we
decorate
with
the
wreaths
of
memory
is
but
a
symbol
of
that
monument
which
exists
in
the
shape
of
the
whole
nation
whose
forces
he
organised
and
whose
purposes
he
directed
to
one
end
the
strength
and
unity
of
the
state
hail
to
prince
mechow
hail
hail
hail
the
whole
crowd
burst
out
in
shouts
of
hail
to
prince
mechow
hail
then
came
renewed
shouts
of
hail
the
emperor
hail
after
he
had
bowed
a
dozen
times
or
so
those
near
him
prepared
to
form
the
procession
back
towards
the
imperial
church
and
for
the
next
two
hours
the
processions
filed
out
to
the
sound
of
music
it
grew
very
tiresome
and
i
was
getting
hungry
so
we
got
permission
to
return
to
our
hotel
for
a
meal
until
now
everybody
had
fasted
but
the
rest
of
the
day
was
given
up
to
a
sort
of
carnival
banquets
were
arranged
to
take
place
in
every
part
of
the
city
and
the
whole
population
prepared
to
enjoy
itself
at
these
banquets
it
is
the
custom
to
make
patriotic
speeches
which
are
faithfully
reported
the
man
who
is
adjudged
to
have
made
the
best
patriotic
speech
is
awarded
a
special
decoration
called
the
prince
mechow
prize
as
the
streets
were
liable
to
be
crowded
with
strangers
it
was
not
thought
fit
to
allow
us
to
wander
about
but
i
learnt
from
johnson
that
as
the
day
goes
on
and
a
large
quantity
of
beer
is
drunk
the
streets
become
filled
with
a
boisterous
crowd
which
is
a
most
unusual
sight
in
mecco
two
things
seemed
to
me
rather
odd
about
this
festival
why
was
it
that
the
emperor
allowed
such
adulation
to
be
paid
to
a
former
subject
and
why
was
the
commemoration
of
prince
mechow
who
had
done
so
much
to
introduce
the
strictest
discipline
the
one
occasion
when
licence
was
allowed
i
put
these
questions
to
johnson
as
we
sat
talking
in
the
where
we
could
faintly
hear
the
murmur
of
the
crowd
in
the
streets
in
the
distance
it
is
just
as
well
you
did
not
ask
these
questions
of
any
of
your
meccanian
conductors
replied
johnson
the
real
reason
is
one
which
i
do
believe
any
meccanian
would
avow
this
mechow
festival
is
a
genuine
expression
of
national
character
they
used
to
about
bludiron
in
almost
the
same
way
some
eighty
years
ago
i
have
heard
my
father
tell
of
some
of
the
scenes
he
saw
here
they
have
a
childish
belief
in
national
heroes
then
the
upper
classes
have
a
very
special
reason
for
encouraging
this
cult
of
mechowism
they
realise
how
completely
he
did
their
work
for
them
and
made
their
power
secure
and
it
suits
them
to
cultivate
the
superstition
that
there
is
something
sacred
about
everything
he
established
perhaps
you
know
that
the
military
class
are
the
real
power
behind
the
throne
here
they
let
the
emperor
play
his
part
on
the
stage
in
public
but
he
takes
good
care
not
to
do
anything
to
offend
them
and
this
worship
of
mechow
is
a
sort
of
symbol
of
their
power
the
real
effect
of
mechow
reforms
was
not
to
make
the
emperor
himself
supreme
but
to
make
the
military
caste
they
take
care
therefore
to
make
this
festival
popular
i
do
suppose
the
emperor
altogether
enjoys
the
part
he
has
to
play
on
an
occasion
like
what
you
say
about
the
military
is
rather
interesting
i
replied
for
only
a
day
or
two
ago
i
was
trying
to
get
lickrod
to
tell
me
what
the
government
really
is
i
could
make
out
whether
he
knew
or
not
but
he
certainly
did
enlighten
me
much
of
course
it
the
military
class
said
johnson
with
a
laugh
i
thought
everybody
knew
that
it
a
very
open
secret
i
have
heard
that
theory
put
forward
i
said
but
i
ca
quite
make
it
square
with
the
facts
why
not
asked
johnson
well
if
the
military
are
the
supreme
power
why
should
they
have
such
an
elaborate
bureaucracy
and
make
such
a
parade
of
culture
in
every
direction
i
said
ah
replied
johnson
you
must
remember
we
are
living
in
the
twentieth
century
in
fact
you
must
remember
all
that
this
wonderful
rascal
of
a
mechow
taught
his
countrymen
the
clumsy
methods
of
the
military
autocracy
of
a
barbarous
age
would
not
be
of
the
slightest
use
in
our
times
human
society
in
modern
times
even
under
an
autocracy
is
tremendously
complex
an
elaborate
bureaucracy
is
a
necessary
part
of
the
machine
suppose
for
instance
that
you
were
an
autocrat
and
you
wanted
to
be
able
to
wield
the
whole
force
of
the
nation
over
which
you
ruled
how
could
you
give
effect
to
your
will
unless
the
whole
nation
were
organised
with
that
end
in
view
suppose
you
had
absolute
power
as
far
as
the
law
could
give
it
you
and
suppose
you
wanted
a
powerful
army
you
would
want
also
the
best
equipment
how
would
you
get
it
unless
your
industries
were
already
organised
and
under
control
there
is
no
doubt
at
all
that
the
nation
that
can
control
and
mobilise
all
its
resources
for
whatever
purposes
it
happens
to
require
them
has
a
great
advantage
from
the
military
standpoint
over
other
nations
not
so
organised
but
i
said
they
organise
all
sorts
of
things
that
have
nothing
to
do
with
military
efficiency
look
at
the
theatres
and
at
art
and
music
their
organisation
of
these
is
carried
to
an
absurd
point
that
is
quite
true
but
did
you
ever
know
any
big
organisation
that
did
just
exactly
what
it
ought
to
do
and
stopped
short
of
the
things
it
ought
not
to
do
once
set
up
a
bureaucracy
and
it
will
inevitably
extend
its
functions
people
are
dirty
so
the
bureaucrat
says
let
us
make
them
then
he
says
let
us
make
them
keep
their
houses
clean
then
he
says
let
us
make
them
keep
their
clothes
tidy
he
does
like
the
way
they
walk
so
he
makes
them
march
in
step
you
can
see
that
there
was
a
tremendous
advantage
in
having
a
middle
class
and
a
working
class
to
secure
this
a
powerful
department
to
organise
and
enforce
education
was
necessary
once
the
bureaucracy
was
created
there
was
hardly
any
limit
to
its
functions
besides
and
this
seems
to
me
rather
important
the
more
widely
extended
are
the
functions
of
the
bureaucracy
the
more
effectually
is
its
main
purpose
disguised
the
people
are
accustomed
to
being
directed
and
they
imagine
in
a
vague
sort
of
way
that
it
is
all
for
their
good
another
little
turn
of
the
screw
is
not
felt
if
the
state
tells
me
what
to
eat
why
should
it
tell
me
what
to
wear
and
what
to
read
and
what
to
think
there
is
another
reason
why
it
all
this
culture
in
every
nation
some
kind
of
intellectual
life
goes
on
it
must
be
either
free
or
controlled
if
it
is
let
alone
the
force
of
ideas
is
such
that
in
the
long
run
they
will
shape
the
political
structure
the
state
if
it
means
to
preserve
itself
as
an
autocracy
must
get
control
over
the
intellectual
life
of
the
nation
in
ancient
times
it
succeeded
for
a
time
in
the
middle
ages
the
church
tried
the
same
thing
in
modern
times
most
states
have
made
the
attempt
but
this
state
made
the
attempt
it
has
done
no
more
than
plato
would
have
done
it
has
done
it
rather
differently
perhaps
but
it
has
followed
the
same
idea
they
would
feel
rather
flattered
do
you
think
i
said
if
you
told
them
they
were
carrying
out
plato
principles
perhaps
they
would
but
that
only
means
they
have
learnt
nothing
from
twenty
centuries
of
political
experience
on
the
contrary
it
looks
as
if
they
have
learnt
a
good
deal
i
said
they
have
learnt
how
to
make
a
nation
of
slaves
and
tyrants
and
yet
they
do
seem
to
mind
being
slaves
if
they
are
slaves
i
wonder
replied
johnson
a
hundred
years
in
the
life
of
a
nation
is
not
a
long
time
human
nature
is
a
strange
thing
they
kiss
the
rod
so
affectionately
that
i
do
mind
how
long
remain
in
bondage
all
i
care
about
is
that
they
should
not
make
slaves
of
the
rest
of
us
do
you
think
there
is
any
danger
i
asked
i
do
indeed
replied
johnson
a
great
danger
why
how
could
it
be
brought
about
i
said
in
all
sorts
of
ways
liberty
is
the
most
precarious
possession
of
the
human
race
very
few
nations
have
possessed
it
for
long
together
but
surely
i
said
meccania
is
so
unpopular
to
put
it
mildly
with
almost
all
other
nations
that
her
influence
can
hardly
be
dangerous
oh
but
it
is
insisted
johnson
the
danger
takes
several
forms
meccania
is
tremendously
strong
as
a
military
power
she
knows
it
and
other
nations
know
it
suppose
a
great
war
took
place
and
she
were
successful
she
would
bring
other
nations
under
her
power
as
she
has
done
in
the
past
these
would
soon
be
compelled
to
adopt
her
institutions
then
in
other
nations
would
feel
themselves
compelled
to
resort
to
the
same
means
as
have
proved
successful
in
her
case
to
make
themselves
strong
too
to
a
certain
degree
that
has
already
taken
place
lots
of
our
military
people
now
are
always
agitating
to
introduce
what
they
call
reforms
to
place
us
on
a
level
with
meccania
then
all
sorts
of
cranks
come
over
here
sanitary
reformers
eugenists
town
planners
educationists
physical
culturists
temperance
reformers
scientific
industrialists
and
so
forth
each
of
them
finds
some
idea
he
wants
to
push
there
are
people
who
think
that
if
they
could
only
cure
unemployment
they
would
bring
in
the
millennium
and
they
are
willing
to
reconstruct
society
for
the
sole
purpose
of
doing
away
with
unemployment
and
so
we
get
disconnected
bits
of
bureaucracy
set
up
first
for
this
and
then
for
that
by
and
by
some
one
will
come
along
who
will
try
to
the
whole
thing
i
had
evidently
set
johnson
on
to
a
train
of
thought
that
excited
him
for
he
usually
took
things
very
calmly
after
a
short
pause
he
went
on
and
yet
i
do
think
the
greatest
danger
comes
from
these
bureaucrats
of
ours
with
us
the
bureaucrat
only
gets
his
chance
when
we
have
played
the
fool
so
badly
that
somebody
has
got
to
step
in
and
set
things
right
for
instance
we
had
what
we
called
magistrates
at
one
time
they
were
supposed
to
be
the
prominent
citizens
with
common
sense
and
initiative
but
they
became
so
incompetent
and
the
authorities
chose
them
so
foolishly
that
they
lost
the
public
confidence
so
we
had
to
replace
them
partly
by
officials
and
partly
by
paid
judges
then
look
at
our
manufacturers
they
had
the
sense
to
apply
a
reasonable
proportion
of
their
profits
to
developing
their
business
on
scientific
lines
so
the
state
had
to
step
in
and
compel
them
to
they
had
the
sense
either
to
encourage
their
workpeople
to
become
educated
nor
even
to
pay
them
any
more
than
they
could
help
consequently
the
state
had
to
step
in
again
no
what
i
am
most
afraid
of
is
our
disinclination
to
set
things
right
ourselves
we
ca
let
mothers
go
on
murdering
their
babies
we
let
food
dealers
poison
the
public
we
ca
let
seducers
of
children
traffic
in
obscenity
and
as
the
public
is
apathetic
about
all
these
things
the
bureaucrat
steps
in
and
adds
another
department
to
the
fabric
what
i
am
afraid
of
chiefly
is
that
we
shall
get
into
a
bad
mess
that
will
place
us
at
the
mercy
either
of
the
meccanians
over
here
or
of
our
own
meccanians
at
home
chapter
ix
meccanisation
when
i
came
to
reflect
that
night
upon
the
experience
of
the
last
few
days
i
was
much
impressed
by
three
things
which
somehow
seemed
to
hang
together
there
was
first
my
conversation
with
lickrod
if
all
meccanians
or
even
a
majority
took
the
same
view
of
the
state
that
he
did
there
could
be
no
limit
to
the
functions
of
the
state
he
seemed
to
claim
for
it
all
the
moral
authority
of
the
mediæval
church
and
although
in
other
countries
theories
are
put
forward
for
academic
discussion
without
having
much
influence
upon
practical
politics
in
meccania
the
powers
that
be
are
able
to
carry
out
their
ideas
without
the
obstruction
which
necessarily
arises
in
countries
where
public
opinion
is
more
spontaneous
he
had
evaded
the
question
as
to
the
control
of
the
government
and
had
maintained
that
such
a
question
had
no
meaning
in
a
country
where
the
people
were
not
conscious
of
any
difference
between
the
state
and
themselves
then
there
was
this
mechow
festival
now
it
was
either
a
sincere
manifestation
of
a
national
admiration
of
prince
mechow
and
an
approval
of
his
work
in
creating
a
with
unlimited
powers
or
it
was
a
proof
that
the
ruling
class
whatever
that
was
could
manipulate
the
whole
life
of
the
nation
as
it
pleased
lastly
there
was
the
idea
that
johnson
had
thrown
out
he
was
quite
confident
of
the
accuracy
of
his
own
view
that
the
military
class
was
the
power
behind
everything
and
that
the
whole
elaborate
bureaucratic
organisation
of
society
had
for
its
motive
and
driving
force
the
desire
and
the
will
to
make
meccania
a
perfect
instrument
of
militarism
up
to
this
time
i
had
been
partly
amused
and
partly
annoyed
by
what
i
had
seen
and
heard
and
experienced
i
was
amused
by
the
meticulous
regulation
and
organisation
of
all
the
petty
details
of
life
by
the
pedantic
precision
of
all
the
officials
i
had
met
and
by
the
utter
absence
of
a
sense
of
humour
in
the
mentality
of
the
meccanian
people
i
had
been
annoyed
by
the
meddlesome
interference
with
my
private
habits
but
i
tried
to
disregard
this
because
as
an
experienced
traveller
i
had
sufficient
experience
to
tell
me
that
in
every
country
one
has
to
accommodate
oneself
to
the
customs
and
prejudices
of
the
community
but
most
of
all
i
felt
baffled
by
my
failure
to
find
out
anything
about
the
real
life
and
thought
and
feeling
of
the
people
i
determined
that
i
would
make
a
more
serious
attempt
to
get
behind
the
screen
which
all
this
officialism
set
up
between
the
people
and
a
foreign
observer
like
myself
or
johnson
i
would
find
out
whether
the
screen
was
erected
only
between
the
foreigner
and
the
people
or
whether
the
people
themselves
were
so
that
even
for
them
intercourse
was
made
difficult
i
promised
myself
that
lickrod
with
his
genuine
enthusiasm
for
every
feature
of
meccanian
culture
would
be
much
more
likely
to
enlighten
me
than
any
person
i
had
come
in
contact
with
before
we
had
still
some
days
to
spend
in
completing
our
general
survey
of
industry
in
mecco
as
president
of
an
important
literary
society
i
expressed
a
desire
to
see
how
the
whole
business
of
literary
production
was
conducted
in
meccania
for
i
understood
that
several
features
in
the
system
were
quite
unlike
what
could
be
found
anywhere
else
in
the
world
conductor
lickrod
was
almost
eager
to
gratify
my
curiosity
at
any
rate
up
to
a
certain
point
the
printing
industry
said
he
in
answer
to
my
questions
is
a
perfect
example
of
the
effect
of
prince
mechow
reforms
it
would
be
impossible
in
any
other
country
to
do
what
we
do
even
if
they
employed
three
times
the
number
of
men
in
other
countries
the
waste
of
labour
not
only
manual
labour
but
brain
labour
and
business
enterprise
is
ridiculous
look
at
the
amount
of
advertising
the
number
of
rival
newspapers
and
magazines
the
number
of
rival
publishers
of
all
sorts
it
is
a
perfect
chaos
now
we
have
no
advertising
as
advertising
is
understood
abroad
every
commodity
can
be
classified
whether
it
be
a
hair
restorer
or
a
mansion
for
sale
our
system
of
commerce
gets
rid
of
advertising
miscellaneous
commodities
the
wholesale
merchants
have
their
regular
catalogues
issued
to
the
trade
and
the
same
system
is
extended
to
retail
trade
for
example
if
you
want
to
buy
an
article
of
clothing
apart
from
your
regular
uniform
you
consult
a
directory
of
the
retail
dealers
then
you
consult
a
catalogue
of
any
particular
firm
at
the
bureau
for
retail
trade
where
you
will
find
a
catalogue
of
every
shop
in
the
town
you
happen
to
be
in
there
are
no
hoardings
covered
with
posters
tempting
people
out
of
mere
curiosity
to
buy
things
they
do
want
now
look
at
a
typical
newspaper
in
any
foreign
country
half
of
it
is
covered
with
advertisements
of
concerts
theatrical
performances
other
amusements
sales
situations
vacant
and
wanted
clothing
patent
medicines
books
every
imaginable
thing
with
us
that
is
all
unnecessary
the
bureaux
of
employment
do
away
with
all
advertisements
for
employment
but
in
any
case
we
should
require
few
of
these
because
our
system
of
employment
is
so
much
better
organised
as
to
concerts
and
theatres
everybody
knows
through
the
official
gazettes
what
amusements
are
available
for
months
in
advance
you
have
not
only
got
rid
of
the
advertisements
i
remarked
but
even
of
the
newspapers
themselves
i
understand
i
have
certainly
seen
none
except
the
local
gazettes
exactly
i
was
coming
to
that
he
continued
look
at
the
enormous
waste
of
effort
that
goes
to
the
production
of
forty
or
fifty
big
newspapers
what
is
the
use
of
them
every
item
of
information
can
be
classified
it
may
be
a
crime
an
accident
an
event
in
foreign
politics
a
new
law
a
trial
a
new
discovery
in
some
branch
of
science
or
industry
and
so
on
now
look
at
all
the
ingenuity
displayed
in
getting
hold
of
some
sort
of
account
of
these
things
at
the
earliest
moment
in
order
to
gratify
the
mere
curiosity
of
crowds
of
ignorant
people
then
look
at
the
special
articles
all
or
nearly
all
produced
in
haste
and
the
leading
articles
all
designed
to
influence
the
mind
of
the
public
by
giving
some
particular
colour
or
interpretation
to
the
alleged
facts
our
official
gazettes
give
the
public
all
they
require
to
know
the
issued
each
week
gives
information
about
all
the
breaches
of
the
law
committed
all
the
important
processes
before
the
law
courts
all
the
changes
in
the
law
all
the
which
are
necessary
to
throw
light
upon
legal
matters
are
written
by
real
experts
as
you
know
the
journalist
is
extinct
in
meccania
the
industrial
gazettes
one
for
each
of
the
main
branches
of
industry
with
a
general
industrial
gazette
for
matters
affecting
industry
generally
contain
everything
required
in
a
much
more
complete
form
than
can
be
given
in
a
daily
newspaper
so
you
see
that
applying
the
same
principle
to
the
various
aspects
of
our
public
life
we
are
able
to
substitute
one
publication
dealing
completely
with
all
matters
and
issued
with
all
the
authority
of
the
state
for
the
miscellaneous
jumble
of
scraps
which
are
called
newspapers
in
other
countries
then
look
at
the
number
of
magazines
they
represent
a
stage
of
culture
which
we
have
left
entirely
behind
we
have
our
literary
gazettes
to
keep
the
public
informed
about
all
the
recent
publications
we
have
our
quarterly
records
for
every
department
of
knowledge
if
you
want
the
latest
contributions
to
history
or
archæology
philology
ethnology
or
anthropology
you
know
where
to
go
for
them
everything
is
done
by
experts
and
we
do
not
go
to
the
trouble
of
printing
anything
by
anyone
else
on
such
subjects
then
you
have
no
popular
magazines
such
as
would
interest
people
who
are
not
strictly
students
but
who
take
an
interest
in
things
i
asked
no
as
i
said
a
moment
ago
we
have
left
that
stage
of
culture
behind
we
provide
a
good
education
for
all
those
who
we
think
are
able
to
utilise
it
for
the
good
of
the
state
after
that
every
one
is
encouraged
to
pursue
that
branch
of
knowledge
which
will
be
most
useful
to
him
in
his
calling
in
a
certain
sense
every
man
is
a
specialist
we
do
not
encourage
people
to
dabble
in
things
they
only
half
understand
but
is
there
not
also
a
need
i
said
for
what
i
may
call
general
knowledge
on
the
part
of
the
public
for
instance
suppose
a
new
law
is
to
be
introduced
which
is
to
affect
people
lives
is
concerned
whether
he
is
a
specialist
or
not
or
suppose
some
question
of
public
morals
or
some
question
of
political
interest
arises
you
surely
want
the
public
to
discuss
such
things
how
indeed
can
your
authorities
keep
in
touch
with
the
public
mind
unless
there
is
some
medium
by
which
the
general
public
can
express
itself
what
you
say
answered
lickrod
only
serves
to
demonstrate
the
truth
of
what
i
am
trying
to
convey
to
you
namely
that
our
culture
is
so
differently
conceived
that
you
foreigners
can
not
understand
our
attitude
you
use
the
expression
opinion
our
psychologists
will
tell
you
exactly
how
that
public
opinion
is
formed
they
made
a
careful
study
of
it
before
we
decided
to
replace
it
by
something
better
it
was
one
of
the
superstitions
of
the
nineteenth
century
which
has
not
only
lingered
on
but
has
become
a
serious
hinderance
to
the
development
of
scientific
government
in
all
countries
except
meccania
they
actually
allow
their
fiscal
policy
to
be
determined
by
opinion
fiscal
policy
is
entirely
a
matter
for
the
state
and
the
only
persons
qualified
to
advise
the
state
are
the
experts
you
speak
of
public
morals
but
the
business
of
guiding
the
morals
of
the
nation
is
the
highest
function
of
the
state
itself
now
the
organs
through
which
every
nation
or
state
functions
are
determined
and
developed
by
the
national
consciousness
this
consciousness
expresses
itself
just
as
legitimately
through
experts
as
through
an
uninstructed
public
opinion
so
you
would
be
prepared
to
say
then
i
said
that
your
people
fully
acquiesce
in
the
suppression
or
abolition
of
one
of
the
institutions
which
most
foreigners
consider
almost
the
last
safeguard
of
liberty
i
mean
of
course
the
daily
press
the
present
generation
of
meccanians
that
is
the
young
people
say
between
twenty
and
thirty
have
never
known
the
press
the
older
men
were
i
confess
bitterly
opposed
for
some
years
or
at
least
a
section
of
them
were
but
if
anyone
proposed
to
revive
the
press
nowadays
he
would
be
regarded
as
one
would
be
who
wished
to
revive
or
wigs
or
general
elections
but
suppose
some
people
were
mad
enough
to
want
to
publish
a
newspaper
could
they
not
do
so
i
asked
well
there
is
no
positive
law
against
it
but
it
would
be
impossible
all
the
same
why
the
expense
would
be
very
great
for
one
thing
there
would
be
no
advertisements
remember
they
would
not
be
allowed
to
publish
news
before
it
had
been
submitted
to
the
censor
or
before
it
was
given
to
the
public
through
the
official
gazettes
you
need
say
no
more
i
said
i
quite
see
it
would
be
impossible
the
censorship
extends
to
all
printed
matter
i
gather
certainly
he
replied
the
state
would
be
guilty
of
a
grave
neglect
of
its
function
as
guardian
of
the
meccanian
spirit
if
it
permitted
any
scribbler
who
wished
to
seduce
the
minds
of
the
people
to
mislead
them
but
i
could
not
help
replying
i
thought
that
your
people
were
on
the
whole
so
well
educated
that
there
would
be
less
danger
of
their
being
misled
in
meccania
than
in
any
country
also
i
have
been
informed
that
all
the
best
writers
are
already
in
the
employ
of
the
state
and
further
that
the
people
generally
are
so
completely
at
one
in
sentiment
with
the
spirit
and
policy
of
the
state
that
there
could
be
no
real
danger
from
the
free
expression
of
opinion
conductor
lickrod
smiled
it
was
a
benevolent
almost
a
pitying
smile
i
perceive
he
said
that
some
of
the
most
commonplace
axioms
of
our
policy
seem
like
abstruse
doctrines
to
people
whose
culture
is
less
advanced
but
i
think
i
can
make
all
this
clear
your
argument
is
that
our
people
are
well
instructed
our
writers
the
best
of
them
are
employed
by
the
state
and
our
common
loyalty
to
the
meccanian
ideal
is
so
firmly
established
that
even
a
free
press
or
at
least
the
free
expression
of
opinion
in
books
would
give
rise
to
no
danger
now
do
you
not
see
that
it
is
only
by
means
of
our
system
so
wisely
conceived
by
the
greatest
statesman
who
ever
lived
that
we
this
instructed
public
that
we
all
the
best
writers
in
the
service
of
the
state
that
we
this
common
allegiance
to
the
meccanian
spirit
when
we
have
achieved
what
no
other
nation
has
achieved
should
we
not
be
fools
to
introduce
an
entirely
contrary
principle
and
for
the
sake
of
what
in
order
to
provide
an
opportunity
for
the
few
people
who
are
not
loyal
to
meccania
to
attack
the
very
state
whose
children
they
are
for
examine
what
it
is
you
propose
no
one
who
is
a
loyal
meccanian
finds
the
least
fault
with
our
present
system
it
has
the
enormous
advantage
over
all
the
systems
of
other
countries
that
without
any
waste
it
provides
the
most
authentic
information
about
every
conceivable
subject
it
gives
the
public
the
benefit
of
the
services
of
such
a
body
of
experts
as
no
other
country
possesses
and
the
people
who
would
write
such
books
as
are
thinking
of
who
would
support
them
they
are
already
fully
employed
in
some
manner
and
in
the
manner
considered
by
the
state
to
be
the
most
useful
i
assure
you
this
is
a
purely
academic
discussion
for
no
one
would
dream
of
putting
into
practice
such
a
proposal
there
must
be
something
in
the
mentality
of
the
meccanians
very
different
from
that
of
other
nations
and
that
is
all
the
more
surprising
because
at
least
according
to
the
ethnologists
they
are
not
racially
different
from
several
of
the
surrounding
nations
that
is
quite
true
with
some
slight
reservations
we
are
not
a
pure
race
by
any
means
we
have
racial
elements
within
our
nation
which
are
indeed
distinct
from
those
of
the
surrounding
nations
and
they
have
perhaps
contributed
to
the
final
result
much
more
than
in
proportion
to
their
actual
numbers
what
you
call
latin
culture
has
never
done
more
than
furnish
us
with
the
material
for
such
elements
of
our
culture
as
we
wished
to
utilise
you
see
it
has
hardly
affected
our
language
no
the
meccanian
culture
of
is
the
result
of
education
and
scientific
statesmanship
excuse
my
putting
the
question
so
bluntly
i
said
but
it
seems
to
me
that
the
principles
you
have
put
forward
would
justify
even
a
revival
of
an
institution
known
in
mediæval
times
and
even
later
as
the
inquisition
i
suppose
there
is
no
institution
corresponding
to
that
in
meccania
it
is
quite
unnecessary
and
that
is
one
powerful
argument
in
favour
of
our
system
of
controlling
the
press
that
control
together
with
our
other
institutions
of
which
it
forms
part
our
whole
polity
is
a
perfect
harmony
makes
an
as
you
call
it
an
anachronism
but
i
said
i
was
told
by
one
of
your
own
people
of
something
that
seems
to
a
mere
outsider
to
resemble
an
incipient
inquisition
indeed
he
said
and
what
is
that
well
i
gathered
that
in
certain
cases
the
special
medical
board
uses
its
discretionary
power
to
incarcerate
persons
whose
opinions
or
convictions
make
it
impossible
for
them
to
embrace
what
i
may
call
the
meccanian
ideals
of
life
i
felt
i
was
treading
on
delicate
ground
but
as
prigge
on
a
previous
occasion
had
openly
approved
of
putting
people
into
lunatic
asylums
if
they
did
not
accept
the
authority
of
the
i
felt
justified
in
sounding
lickrod
on
the
point
to
my
surprise
he
betrayed
no
embarrassment
you
are
probably
not
aware
he
said
of
the
remarkable
strides
that
have
been
made
by
our
medical
scientists
in
meccania
during
the
last
fifty
years
the
pathological
side
of
psychology
has
received
great
attention
with
the
consequence
that
our
specialists
are
able
to
detect
mental
disease
in
cases
where
it
would
not
be
suspected
by
less
skilled
doctors
i
believe
i
am
right
in
saying
that
our
experts
detected
the
disease
now
widely
recognised
as
chronic
tendency
to
dissent
long
before
it
was
known
in
other
countries
that
such
a
characteristic
was
in
any
way
connected
with
brain
disease
the
microbe
has
been
fully
described
in
the
volume
of
the
of
the
special
medical
the
first
clue
to
the
existence
of
this
disease
was
discovered
during
the
great
war
or
perhaps
a
little
later
a
number
of
people
persisted
in
putting
forward
views
concerning
the
origin
of
the
war
which
were
totally
at
variance
with
the
official
and
even
the
imperial
explanatory
statements
made
for
the
enlightenment
of
the
public
at
the
time
it
was
regarded
as
just
mental
perversity
but
what
led
to
the
discovery
was
that
after
ten
and
even
fifteen
years
in
some
cases
notwithstanding
every
natural
inducement
to
desist
from
such
perversity
these
people
deliberately
and
persistently
maintained
the
objectivity
of
their
hallucinations
experiments
were
made
they
were
under
close
observation
for
some
years
and
at
length
doctor
produced
his
theory
and
confidently
predicted
that
the
bacillus
would
be
found
in
a
few
years
from
that
time
the
path
was
clear
the
disease
was
most
rife
some
forty
years
ago
soon
after
the
beginning
of
prince
mechow
premiership
but
since
then
it
has
almost
disappeared
you
see
it
is
not
hereditary
and
the
normal
conditions
of
meccanian
life
are
very
unfavourable
to
its
development
but
coming
back
to
your
point
although
no
doubt
this
is
what
has
given
rise
to
the
calumny
that
the
special
medical
board
uses
its
powers
as
an
inquisition
there
is
not
a
vestige
of
truth
in
the
charge
each
case
and
the
cases
are
becoming
very
rare
indeed
is
investigated
on
strictly
lines
the
patients
in
all
cases
are
isolated
and
placed
under
observation
for
some
months
before
any
pronouncement
is
made
your
explanation
is
as
usual
most
illuminating
i
replied
and
the
patience
with
which
you
deal
with
my
questions
emboldens
me
to
put
to
you
some
further
difficulties
that
have
been
puzzling
me
proceed
replied
lickrod
encouragingly
well
now
i
said
your
whole
national
culture
is
so
elaborately
perfect
from
the
standpoint
of
its
basic
principles
that
it
is
certainly
well
worth
studying
by
any
student
of
sociology
or
politics
or
economics
yet
we
foreigners
find
ourselves
hampered
at
many
points
whenever
we
wish
to
get
into
contact
with
certain
kinds
of
facts
for
instance
we
may
wish
to
find
out
what
are
the
ideas
the
current
thoughts
and
feelings
of
the
various
groups
and
even
individuals
who
make
up
society
we
can
not
go
and
live
with
people
and
converse
freely
with
them
i
have
not
been
able
to
understand
why
your
government
takes
such
precautions
to
keep
secret
as
it
were
facts
which
in
any
other
country
are
as
open
as
the
day
that
is
not
at
all
difficult
to
answer
by
anyone
who
really
understands
the
principles
of
our
culture
and
i
am
surprised
that
none
of
the
conductors
who
have
instructed
you
have
explained
it
that
is
if
you
have
asked
them
he
answered
you
have
been
hampered
you
say
yes
but
you
have
been
assisted
too
you
have
been
shown
things
in
a
way
that
would
be
impossible
in
most
other
countries
within
such
a
short
time
our
government
has
paid
great
attention
to
the
instruction
of
foreigners
instead
of
leaving
them
to
gather
all
sorts
of
erroneous
impressions
it
provides
them
with
authentic
information
if
on
the
other
hand
there
are
things
which
it
does
not
wish
foreigners
to
know
it
takes
care
and
quite
rightly
that
they
shall
not
obtain
the
information
by
any
illicit
means
for
instance
if
you
were
foolish
enough
to
attempt
to
obtain
information
about
our
military
affairs
you
would
find
yourself
against
a
blank
wall
and
if
i
may
say
so
you
might
hurt
your
head
against
the
wall
but
then
there
are
matters
which
without
being
secret
can
not
well
be
investigated
by
the
individual
inquirer
take
such
a
thing
as
the
current
thought
of
any
particular
class
or
group
only
a
trained
and
is
capable
of
making
such
an
inquiry
the
liability
to
error
is
tremendous
all
the
books
written
by
travellers
reveal
this
we
do
not
wish
to
be
exploited
by
casual
and
irresponsible
travellers
we
provide
opportunities
under
proper
conditions
for
expert
investigators
but
very
few
are
willing
to
comply
with
the
conditions
besides
our
culture
like
all
the
finest
products
of
the
human
intellect
is
a
very
delicate
thing
when
we
have
carefully
educated
our
people
in
the
meccanian
spirit
we
are
not
prepared
to
expose
them
to
the
insidious
influences
of
irresponsible
busybodies
every
meccanian
is
valuable
in
our
eyes
and
just
as
we
protect
him
from
infection
in
the
shape
of
physical
disease
so
we
protect
him
from
the
more
insidious
but
not
less
injurious
influence
of
foreign
ideas
you
will
find
plenty
of
philosophical
justification
for
that
policy
in
the
writings
of
plato
and
aristotle
two
philosophers
who
are
studied
in
all
the
foreign
universities
but
whose
systems
of
thought
are
utterly
misunderstood
except
in
meccania
chapter
x
conversations
it
must
have
been
more
than
a
week
after
my
long
talk
with
conductor
lickrod
that
i
was
sitting
one
evening
in
the
hotel
with
johnson
and
a
certain
francarian
gentleman
to
whom
he
had
introduced
me
when
the
latter
made
a
suggestion
that
has
since
proved
very
useful
to
me
villele
the
francarian
is
a
short
and
rather
stout
man
of
middle
age
with
a
pair
of
merry
black
eyes
a
swarthy
complexion
and
dark
hair
beginning
to
turn
grey
he
professes
to
find
meccania
and
the
meccanians
amusing
but
i
suspect
from
the
nature
of
his
sarcasms
that
he
entertains
a
deep
hatred
of
them
we
were
talking
of
my
journal
when
he
said
and
what
is
the
use
of
it
well
i
said
i
do
not
flatter
myself
that
i
can
produce
a
great
literary
work
but
the
facts
i
have
been
able
to
place
on
record
are
so
interesting
in
themselves
that
i
believe
my
countrymen
would
welcome
a
plain
straightforward
account
of
my
visit
to
this
most
extraordinary
country
i
have
heard
he
said
that
the
chinese
have
very
good
verbal
memories
have
you
committed
your
record
to
memory
in
its
entirety
why
should
i
i
replied
it
is
to
save
my
memory
that
i
am
taking
the
trouble
of
making
such
full
notes
even
of
such
things
as
conversations
and
how
do
you
propose
to
get
your
journal
out
of
the
country
i
propose
to
take
it
with
me
when
i
return
i
said
at
this
he
turned
to
johnson
and
laughed
but
immediately
apologised
for
his
apparent
rudeness
and
what
about
the
censor
he
asked
surely
i
replied
these
people
take
such
precautions
not
to
let
us
foreigners
see
anything
they
do
not
want
us
to
see
that
they
can
not
object
to
a
faithful
record
being
made
of
what
they
do
permit
us
to
see
then
you
have
not
even
read
regulation
of
the
law
concerning
foreign
observers
what
is
that
i
asked
simply
that
foreigners
are
not
allowed
to
take
out
of
the
country
anything
they
have
not
been
permitted
to
bring
in
except
with
the
consent
of
the
chief
inspector
of
foreign
observers
and
you
think
they
will
object
i
have
not
the
slightest
doubt
but
it
is
written
partly
in
chinese
they
would
have
to
translate
it
all
the
more
reason
for
detaining
it
if
you
ever
get
it
again
it
will
be
in
a
few
years
after
it
has
been
translated
for
the
benefit
of
the
sociological
section
of
the
ministry
of
culture
what
do
you
advise
me
to
do
then
i
asked
have
you
any
friends
at
the
chinese
embassy
he
asked
i
have
no
personal
friends
at
least
i
have
not
troubled
to
inquire
i
have
had
no
business
at
the
embassy
there
seemed
no
reason
why
i
should
trouble
them
there
is
a
of
yours
here
in
mecco
who
is
with
the
authorities
said
villele
but
he
is
rather
a
dark
horse
a
dark
horse
i
said
he
is
a
sort
of
convert
to
meccanianism
he
has
written
books
in
appreciation
of
meccanian
principles
meccanian
ideals
meccanian
institutions
and
so
forth
they
are
eagerly
read
by
the
meccanians
they
even
use
them
in
their
colleges
i
have
read
them
and
they
seem
to
me
very
clever
indeed
i
translated
them
for
the
benefit
of
my
countrymen
and
i
am
not
exactly
an
admirer
of
things
meccanian
i
must
have
looked
rather
puzzled
for
johnson
came
to
my
rescue
villele
means
he
said
that
these
books
have
a
double
meaning
i
have
read
one
of
them
under
cover
of
the
most
exuberant
flattery
he
gives
such
an
impression
of
the
devilishness
of
the
system
that
some
of
us
suspect
his
real
purpose
to
be
that
of
exposing
the
whole
business
he
knows
more
of
meccania
than
anyone
who
is
not
a
high
official
said
villele
and
if
you
want
to
pursue
your
investigations
any
further
and
incidentally
get
your
manuscript
conveyed
out
of
the
country
i
should
advise
you
to
seek
an
interview
with
him
will
that
be
possible
i
asked
without
arousing
suspicion
oh
quite
easily
answered
villele
is
above
suspicion
if
you
are
not
he
added
smiling
he
holds
a
weekly
for
foreigners
and
you
can
easily
get
permission
to
attend
after
that
i
leave
it
to
you
and
him
that
evening
we
went
on
talking
a
long
time
villele
related
some
remarkable
things
but
i
was
not
sure
whether
he
was
merely
making
fun
of
the
meccanians
you
have
not
seen
much
of
the
meccanian
women
he
remarked
no
i
said
i
have
had
no
opportunity
they
are
quite
as
wonderful
as
the
men
he
said
you
never
heard
for
instance
of
the
great
emancipation
act
regulation
of
the
marital
law
no
i
replied
what
is
it
no
meccanian
woman
is
obliged
to
submit
to
the
embraces
of
her
lawful
husband
but
how
did
the
men
ever
consent
to
such
a
law
i
asked
for
in
this
country
it
is
the
men
who
make
the
laws
it
is
rather
a
queer
story
he
replied
it
is
quite
a
long
time
ago
forty
years
or
more
since
a
movement
arose
among
the
women
influenced
no
doubt
by
the
women
movement
in
europe
which
had
for
its
object
or
one
of
its
objects
greater
freedom
from
the
domestic
tyranny
of
the
meccanian
husband
some
of
them
of
course
thought
that
the
way
to
secure
everything
they
wanted
was
to
get
the
right
to
vote
for
the
national
council
but
the
wiser
among
them
saw
that
the
vote
was
merely
a
bad
joke
anybody
could
have
the
vote
because
it
was
worth
nothing
seeing
that
the
powers
of
the
representatives
were
being
reduced
to
nothing
all
the
same
this
women
movement
such
as
it
was
was
the
nearest
approach
to
a
revolutionary
movement
that
the
meccanians
have
ever
shown
themselves
capable
of
once
more
our
dear
old
prince
mechow
came
to
the
rescue
he
was
a
real
genius
but
i
thought
you
did
not
admire
the
mechow
reforms
i
interrupted
i
do
not
but
i
recognise
a
genius
when
i
see
him
believe
me
prince
mechow
was
the
first
meccanian
to
understand
his
countrymen
he
knew
exactly
what
they
wanted
what
they
would
stand
what
they
could
do
what
they
could
be
made
to
believe
he
was
absorbed
in
his
early
reforms
when
this
women
movement
broke
out
and
some
people
were
afraid
of
it
he
attacked
the
problem
in
his
characteristic
fashion
he
knew
the
women
did
want
political
power
he
knew
also
that
there
was
not
the
slightest
danger
of
them
getting
it
but
he
saw
immense
possibilities
in
having
the
women
as
his
allies
in
certain
of
his
reforms
especially
his
eugenic
reforms
he
hit
upon
a
really
brilliant
idea
i
do
suppose
you
can
guess
what
it
was
how
can
i
i
said
all
this
is
quite
new
to
me
well
if
you
had
read
meccanian
literature
or
even
the
writings
of
the
old
travellers
in
meccania
your
predecessors
as
foreign
observers
you
would
know
that
the
meccanian
women
are
the
most
primitive
in
europe
they
have
one
ideal
as
regards
men
they
have
a
superstitious
admiration
for
physical
strength
if
a
meccanian
woman
were
really
free
to
choose
her
mate
in
cases
out
of
a
hundred
she
would
choose
the
strongest
man
they
have
always
been
like
that
probably
many
primitive
peoples
have
had
that
characteristic
but
the
meccanians
have
preserved
that
trait
longest
you
think
i
am
joking
or
spinning
a
theory
i
was
thinking
that
as
they
have
had
the
same
marriage
laws
as
the
rest
of
europe
for
many
centuries
the
fact
if
it
is
a
fact
can
not
be
of
much
practical
importance
i
said
the
fact
itself
is
vouched
for
by
dozens
of
writers
among
the
meccanians
they
pride
themselves
on
having
preserved
these
primitive
characteristics
they
glory
in
never
having
been
influenced
by
latin
culture
the
marriage
laws
you
speak
of
have
been
adopted
by
the
men
in
so
to
speak
in
very
early
times
the
meccanian
marriage
laws
were
essentially
the
same
as
they
have
been
for
two
thousand
years
and
the
penalties
on
the
women
for
infractions
of
the
marriage
laws
were
more
severe
in
practice
than
in
any
other
country
notice
the
facts
breaches
of
the
code
before
marriage
are
regarded
very
lightly
illegitimacy
in
meccania
as
is
proved
by
statistics
was
more
prevalent
than
in
most
countries
but
the
men
took
care
that
breaches
after
marriage
should
be
severely
dealt
with
i
told
you
it
was
a
long
story
and
i
have
not
yet
come
to
the
point
for
twenty
or
thirty
years
before
prince
mechow
got
into
the
saddle
all
the
young
meccanian
patriots
got
eugenics
on
the
brain
but
none
of
them
knew
how
to
put
their
ideas
into
practice
mechow
himself
was
a
eugenist
of
the
most
brutal
type
he
believed
that
if
he
could
once
utilise
this
primitive
instinct
of
the
meccanian
women
he
could
do
something
much
more
effective
than
eliminating
certain
feeble
types
which
was
all
that
the
eugenist
theorists
had
so
far
aimed
at
he
proposed
to
give
every
woman
the
right
to
choose
within
limits
the
father
of
her
children
he
knew
that
all
the
meccanian
women
were
obsessed
with
a
frantic
admiration
for
the
military
class
in
the
old
days
it
was
the
ambition
of
every
woman
to
marry
an
officer
and
that
was
why
the
officers
who
were
not
never
had
any
difficulty
in
getting
a
rich
well
he
actually
made
a
law
to
the
effect
that
any
woman
could
claim
a
sort
of
exemption
from
the
marital
rights
of
her
husband
upon
the
recommendation
of
an
authorised
medical
man
but
why
on
earth
did
the
men
consent
to
such
a
law
i
asked
once
more
that
was
easily
done
you
had
only
to
invoke
the
meccanian
spirit
devotion
to
the
supreme
interests
of
the
state
the
opinion
of
the
experts
and
all
the
rest
of
it
the
opposition
was
stifled
the
three
highest
classes
were
all
for
it
the
women
supported
it
and
although
they
had
no
political
power
they
made
opposition
impossible
and
what
effect
has
this
law
had
i
am
afraid
i
do
not
see
how
it
would
effect
the
purpose
prince
mechow
had
in
view
i
said
the
consequences
have
been
enormous
i
do
not
mean
that
the
law
by
itself
effected
much
but
taken
as
part
of
a
system
it
solved
the
whole
problem
from
mechow
point
of
view
but
how
i
asked
somewhat
puzzled
you
understand
i
suppose
the
system
of
medical
inspection
and
medical
supervision
and
medical
treatment
to
a
certain
extent
i
replied
well
you
realise
perhaps
that
in
the
hands
of
a
patriotic
medical
staff
the
system
can
be
so
worked
that
every
woman
who
is
can
be
provided
with
a
mate
from
an
approved
panel
drawn
chiefly
from
the
military
class
eh
is
this
one
of
villele
jokes
at
the
expense
of
the
meccanians
i
asked
johnson
he
is
telling
the
story
in
his
own
way
answered
johnson
but
in
substance
it
is
quite
true
but
it
sounds
incredible
i
said
what
do
the
husbands
say
to
it
oh
the
business
is
done
very
quietly
a
woman
is
ordered
a
by
the
authority
and
she
goes
away
for
a
little
time
the
men
on
the
panel
are
kept
in
training
like
pugilists
used
to
be
as
for
the
husbands
did
you
ever
attend
any
lectures
in
the
universities
on
meccanian
ethics
of
course
you
have
not
been
in
the
country
very
long
jealousy
is
regarded
as
an
obsolete
virtue
or
vice
whichever
you
like
besides
you
must
not
imagine
the
custom
affects
large
numbers
probably
not
more
than
per
cent
of
the
women
chiefly
in
the
fifth
and
sixth
and
to
some
extent
in
the
fourth
class
are
affected
but
i
should
have
thought
that
social
caste
would
be
an
insuperable
obstacle
i
said
surely
not
when
did
you
hear
that
women
were
chosen
for
such
purposes
from
any
particular
class
it
is
not
a
question
of
marriage
there
is
one
circumstance
interposed
johnson
that
has
some
bearing
on
this
subject
domestic
life
in
meccania
for
generations
past
has
been
based
on
quite
a
different
ideal
from
that
prevalent
in
other
parts
of
europe
a
meccanian
in
the
old
days
used
to
choose
a
wife
very
much
as
he
would
choose
a
horse
she
was
thought
of
as
the
mother
of
children
in
fact
the
meccanian
sociologists
used
to
maintain
that
this
was
one
of
the
marks
of
their
superiority
over
other
european
nations
conjugal
affection
was
recognised
only
as
a
sort
of
of
marriage
of
course
they
always
pretended
to
cultivate
a
kind
of
romanticism
because
they
wrote
a
lot
of
verse
about
the
spring
and
moonlight
and
kisses
and
but
their
romanticism
never
went
beyond
that
as
the
object
of
meccanian
sentiment
one
person
would
do
just
as
well
as
another
our
friend
seems
very
much
surprised
at
many
things
he
finds
in
meccania
remarked
villele
and
my
own
countrymen
and
more
especially
my
own
countrywomen
only
half
believe
the
accounts
they
read
about
this
country
simply
because
they
think
human
nature
is
the
same
everywhere
but
then
they
are
ignorant
of
history
civilisations
just
as
extraordinary
have
existed
in
ancient
times
created
through
the
influence
of
a
few
dominant
ideas
the
meccanians
are
a
primitive
people
with
a
mechanical
culture
they
have
never
been
civilised
because
they
have
no
conception
of
an
individual
soul
consequently
they
find
it
easy
to
devote
themselves
to
a
common
purpose
the
conversation
went
on
for
a
long
time
it
was
a
warm
summer
evening
and
we
were
sitting
in
the
garden
at
the
back
of
the
hotel
otherwise
we
should
have
been
rather
more
guarded
in
our
remarks
as
we
parted
villele
repeated
his
advice
to
seek
an
interview
with
kwang
as
he
called
him
his
name
was
but
for
convenience
i
shall
allude
to
him
as
mr
kwang
a
day
or
two
later
i
contrived
to
get
an
interview
with
him
and
although
conductor
lickrod
was
present
i
soon
discovered
that
kwang
and
i
were
members
of
the
same
secret
society
he
promised
that
i
should
see
him
again
before
long
and
that
he
would
be
happy
to
assist
me
in
any
way
he
could
he
told
lickrod
that
he
had
been
doing
his
best
for
the
last
five
years
to
induce
the
chinese
government
to
send
more
to
meccania
but
his
enthusiasm
for
meccania
had
perhaps
defeated
its
own
object
as
it
caused
him
to
be
mistrusted
his
writings
on
meccania
were
well
known
and
it
was
thought
that
he
was
trying
to
proselytise
he
spoke
most
flatteringly
of
me
to
lickrod
and
said
that
in
view
of
the
influence
i
should
have
in
my
own
country
it
was
well
worth
while
giving
me
every
facility
to
see
all
i
wished
he
would
guarantee
that
under
his
tutelage
i
should
soon
learn
to
appreciate
things
from
the
right
point
of
view
two
days
after
this
i
received
a
message
to
call
on
the
chief
inspector
of
foreigners
he
received
me
most
politely
and
almost
apologised
for
not
having
had
time
to
see
me
before
he
had
only
just
learnt
that
i
was
a
friend
of
the
excellent
kwang
he
said
i
should
be
permitted
to
visit
kwang
whenever
i
chose
and
that
i
was
now
at
liberty
to
make
use
of
the
letters
of
introduction
i
had
brought
with
me
to
several
persons
in
meccania
it
would
not
be
necessary
for
me
to
be
accompanied
by
a
every
day
he
would
transfer
me
to
class
b
stage
ii
class
b
meant
foreign
observers
staying
not
less
than
six
months
and
stage
ii
meant
that
they
were
permitted
to
submit
a
plan
each
week
showing
how
they
proposed
to
spend
the
following
week
so
that
on
the
days
which
were
occupied
to
the
satisfaction
of
the
inspector
of
foreign
observers
for
the
district
the
services
of
a
could
be
dispensed
with
i
did
not
know
whether
to
avail
myself
of
my
liberty
or
not
for
when
i
came
to
talk
the
matter
over
with
the
only
person
at
hand
conductor
lickrod
i
found
that
it
was
not
very
easy
to
prepare
a
plan
that
would
be
accepted
by
the
authorities
unless
i
were
prepared
to
pursue
some
definite
line
of
research
when
i
talked
of
taking
a
few
walks
in
the
poorer
quarters
calling
in
for
a
few
lectures
in
the
university
hearing
some
concerts
and
seeing
some
plays
and
other
amusements
looking
round
the
museums
a
programme
innocent
enough
in
all
conscience
lickrod
said
no
inspector
would
sanction
such
a
miscellaneous
for
an
observer
in
stage
ii
i
was
not
qualified
to
attend
concerts
i
had
not
yet
received
permission
to
visit
the
theatre
unless
i
were
pursuing
some
particular
study
i
could
only
visit
the
museums
in
company
with
a
conductor
as
for
a
stroll
through
the
poorer
quarters
he
failed
to
see
the
object
of
that
on
the
whole
i
decided
to
stick
to
lickrod
for
another
week
at
any
rate
i
asked
if
i
might
see
something
of
education
in
mecco
he
said
certainly
if
i
desired
to
make
a
study
of
meccanian
pedagogics
for
a
period
of
not
less
than
four
months
otherwise
it
would
not
be
possible
to
enter
any
of
the
educational
institutions
i
could
get
permission
to
read
in
the
great
library
if
i
would
specify
the
subject
or
subjects
and
show
that
i
was
qualified
to
pursue
them
in
that
way
i
could
read
up
meccanian
education
if
i
were
not
willing
to
do
this
he
advised
me
to
talk
to
johnson
who
was
a
keen
and
capable
student
of
meccanian
pedagogics
i
suggested
investigating
meccanian
political
institutions
but
similar
difficulties
arose
there
i
could
only
study
meccanian
politics
if
i
were
registered
as
a
specialist
and
for
that
i
should
have
to
obtain
permission
from
the
department
for
foreign
affairs
as
well
as
from
the
chief
inspector
of
foreign
observers
he
remarked
however
that
in
his
opinion
there
was
little
to
study
beyond
what
could
be
got
from
books
the
political
system
of
meccania
was
really
simplicity
itself
when
once
the
fundamental
principles
had
been
grasped
i
replied
that
in
most
countries
it
took
a
foreigner
rather
a
long
time
to
understand
the
views
and
policy
of
the
many
different
groups
and
sections
in
the
representative
assemblies
each
of
them
usually
had
their
organisations
and
their
special
point
of
view
he
replied
that
in
meccania
the
state
itself
was
the
only
political
organisation
but
i
said
when
your
members
of
the
national
council
meet
do
they
not
fall
into
groups
according
to
their
views
upon
policy
they
are
grouped
according
to
classes
of
course
he
answered
each
of
the
seven
classes
has
the
same
number
of
representatives
and
there
is
no
doubt
a
tendency
for
the
representatives
of
each
class
to
consider
things
somewhat
from
the
point
of
view
of
the
interests
of
their
class
but
the
members
have
no
meetings
except
in
the
full
assembly
and
in
the
committees
such
form
no
part
of
the
constitution
we
do
not
do
things
by
halves
when
the
state
decided
to
have
nothing
to
do
with
party
government
it
decided
also
not
to
have
anything
to
do
with
group
government
there
is
no
room
for
such
trifling
in
meccania
so
you
see
there
is
nothing
for
you
to
investigate
in
this
direction
the
classes
themselves
then
is
there
no
body
of
opinion
no
collective
political
tradition
or
sentiment
cultivated
by
the
various
classes
you
might
find
something
there
said
lickrod
musing
a
little
but
except
in
the
shape
of
books
i
do
not
know
how
you
would
get
at
it
but
all
books
are
censored
are
they
not
i
said
certainly
but
how
does
that
affect
the
question
books
would
hardly
give
me
a
truthful
idea
of
all
the
currents
of
thought
but
surely
you
can
not
suppose
that
the
state
would
assist
you
in
trying
to
discover
things
which
by
its
deliberate
action
it
had
already
thought
it
desirable
to
suppress
he
answered
besides
he
added
such
things
belong
rather
to
the
pathology
of
politics
by
the
way
you
would
find
some
useful
matter
in
doctor
squelcher
great
work
on
political
pathology
that
is
a
new
term
to
me
i
said
doctor
squelcher
researches
have
proved
invaluable
to
the
special
medical
board
in
connection
with
the
disease
chronic
tendency
to
dissent
which
you
also
had
not
heard
of
in
view
of
this
conversation
my
attempt
to
investigate
meccanian
politics
did
not
seem
likely
to
meet
with
much
success
before
seeing
kwang
again
i
received
an
invitation
to
dine
with
a
certain
industrial
director
blobber
one
of
the
persons
to
whom
i
had
a
letter
of
introduction
he
lived
in
a
very
pleasant
villa
in
the
third
quarter
and
as
it
was
the
first
time
i
had
had
an
opportunity
of
seeing
the
interior
of
any
private
i
was
naturally
rather
curious
to
observe
everything
in
the
house
the
door
was
opened
by
a
servant
in
a
livery
of
grey
the
hall
was
spotlessly
clean
and
decorated
in
yellow
tones
to
indicate
the
class
to
which
my
host
belonged
i
was
shown
into
what
i
took
to
be
a
the
prevailing
tone
of
which
was
also
yellow
the
first
thing
that
struck
me
was
the
peculiar
construction
of
the
easy
chairs
in
the
room
they
were
all
fitted
with
mechanical
contrivances
which
enabled
them
to
be
adjusted
in
any
position
at
first
i
thought
they
were
chairs
but
they
were
all
alike
the
other
furniture
suggested
the
latest
phases
of
meccanian
decorative
art
but
it
would
be
tedious
to
describe
it
in
detail
the
frieze
was
decorated
with
a
curious
geometrical
design
executed
in
the
seven
colours
there
were
silk
hangings
which
at
first
i
took
to
be
chinese
but
which
i
soon
saw
were
imitations
the
carpet
had
the
imperial
arms
woven
in
the
centre
it
seems
it
is
one
of
the
privileges
of
officials
of
the
third
class
to
have
the
imperial
arms
as
a
decoration
on
certain
articles
of
furniture
only
members
of
the
second
and
first
classes
may
have
their
own
arms
the
mantelpiece
was
large
and
clumsy
a
bust
of
the
reigning
emperor
stood
on
one
side
and
one
of
prince
mechow
on
the
other
blobber
joined
me
in
a
few
minutes
he
was
dressed
in
a
lounge
suit
of
bright
yellow
with
green
buttons
the
buttons
indicated
that
he
had
been
promoted
from
the
fourth
class
he
was
polite
in
a
condescending
sort
of
way
and
spoke
to
me
as
if
i
had
been
a
child
he
was
a
foot
taller
than
i
am
and
decidedly
portly
in
build
he
had
a
red
face
a
rather
lumpy
nose
and
a
large
bald
forehead
he
wore
spectacles
and
was
decorated
with
the
beard
which
he
not
only
stroked
but
combed
in
my
presence
after
the
first
formal
greetings
he
said
so
you
have
come
all
the
way
from
the
other
side
of
the
world
to
see
our
wonderful
country
you
had
all
the
countries
in
the
world
to
choose
from
and
you
had
the
good
sense
to
come
to
meccania
you
decided
well
and
i
hope
you
have
been
profiting
by
your
stay
yes
i
said
i
have
seen
a
great
many
things
to
admire
already
for
example
he
said
the
wonderful
roof
of
your
great
central
station
i
said
ah
yes
unique
is
it
not
we
have
of
course
the
finest
railway
stations
in
the
world
and
the
finest
railway
system
too
but
that
is
only
part
of
our
industrial
organisation
you
have
indeed
a
wonderful
industrial
system
i
said
and
no
industrial
problem
no
industrial
problem
he
replied
we
have
a
great
many
we
do
not
produce
half
enough
of
course
compared
with
other
countries
it
may
seem
that
we
are
doing
very
well
but
we
are
not
satisfied
i
meant
rather
that
you
have
no
disturbances
no
strikes
no
trade
unionism
or
anything
of
that
sort
of
course
you
can
not
help
thinking
of
what
you
have
seen
in
other
countries
no
we
have
no
time
for
nonsense
of
that
kind
but
i
take
no
interest
in
that
sort
of
thing
i
have
enough
to
do
with
my
work
the
chief
director
of
the
imperial
porcelain
factory
is
a
busy
man
i
assure
you
at
this
moment
madame
blobber
came
in
and
i
was
introduced
to
her
she
was
a
great
contrast
to
her
husband
in
many
ways
she
was
tall
and
rather
thin
at
any
rate
for
a
meccanian
and
would
have
been
graceful
but
for
a
certain
stiffness
and
coldness
in
her
manner
and
bearing
she
had
a
pale
face
with
cold
blue
eyes
her
mouth
was
rather
large
and
her
lips
thin
and
flexible
while
her
husband
voice
was
leathery
like
that
of
most
meccanians
hers
was
thin
and
penetrating
but
not
loud
we
crossed
into
the
a
butler
in
a
livery
saw
that
all
was
in
order
and
left
the
room
waiting
was
unnecessary
the
first
dishes
were
on
the
table
where
they
were
kept
hot
by
electricity
and
others
on
the
sideboard
were
afterwards
handed
by
a
woman
servant
in
a
grey
uniform
it
was
a
rather
silent
meal
blobber
was
much
occupied
with
his
food
which
he
evidently
enjoyed
and
at
a
later
stage
he
relapsed
into
a
sleepy
condition
madame
blobber
then
took
the
lead
in
the
conversation
she
was
evidently
a
very
woman
especially
in
all
matters
relating
to
art
i
suspected
she
had
no
children
and
had
made
herself
a
she
talked
like
a
professor
and
with
all
the
dogmatism
of
one
she
said
the
chinese
had
never
had
any
true
knowledge
of
colour
they
had
merely
hit
upon
some
colours
which
were
pleasing
to
a
crude
taste
the
meccanians
in
fifty
years
had
absorbed
all
the
knowledge
the
chinese
had
ever
possessed
and
much
more
besides
i
ventured
to
say
that
there
were
still
some
secrets
of
artistic
production
in
porcelain
that
foreigners
had
not
discovered
she
laughed
at
the
idea
the
she
said
were
the
very
things
the
meccanian
experts
had
rejected
as
of
no
value
i
might
as
well
say
that
the
chinese
political
constitution
was
a
secret
because
the
meccanians
had
not
adopted
it
when
i
suggested
that
scientific
knowledge
was
not
a
complete
equipment
for
art
and
would
not
necessarily
increase
the
artistic
powers
of
a
nation
she
said
this
was
a
mere
superstition
art
was
not
a
mystery
every
work
of
art
admitted
of
being
analysed
the
laws
of
its
production
were
ascertainable
and
it
could
be
reproduced
or
modified
in
every
conceivable
way
i
asked
if
the
same
were
true
of
music
i
had
heard
i
said
that
for
nearly
a
hundred
years
even
the
meccanians
had
produced
no
great
musician
another
superstition
she
declared
the
great
musicians
as
they
were
called
were
merely
the
pioneers
of
music
their
works
were
much
overrated
in
foreign
countries
we
have
proved
by
analysis
she
said
that
they
were
merely
groping
for
their
effects
know
what
they
wanted
to
effect
and
we
have
discovered
how
to
get
those
effects
musical
psychology
was
an
unknown
science
a
hundred
years
ago
why
the
old
composers
had
simply
no
means
of
testing
the
psychological
effects
of
their
works
by
experiment
i
am
afraid
i
am
very
ignorant
of
musical
science
i
said
in
fact
i
did
not
even
know
there
was
such
a
thing
as
a
science
of
music
what
did
you
think
music
was
she
almost
snapped
simply
one
of
the
arts
i
said
there
can
be
no
art
in
the
proper
sense
without
a
science
but
i
thought
you
europeans
considered
that
in
sculpture
for
example
the
ancients
had
never
been
surpassed
and
yet
they
had
no
science
of
sculpture
their
science
was
probably
lost
but
have
recovered
the
true
science
the
basis
of
all
sculpture
is
accurate
measurement
whatever
has
bulk
whatever
occupies
space
can
be
measured
if
your
instruments
are
fine
enough
our
instruments
fine
enough
we
can
reproduce
any
statue
ever
made
by
any
artist
but
that
is
only
copying
i
said
how
do
you
create
the
process
is
a
little
more
elaborate
but
the
principles
are
exactly
the
same
even
the
classical
sculptors
had
models
had
they
not
well
our
sculptors
also
use
models
they
pose
them
in
thousands
of
different
positions
until
they
have
the
attitude
they
want
they
have
instruments
to
enable
them
to
fix
them
in
position
and
the
rest
is
merely
accurate
measurement
i
should
never
have
imagined
that
sculpture
had
been
carried
to
such
a
point
i
remarked
is
there
much
of
it
in
meccania
not
a
great
deal
of
the
finer
work
accurate
measurement
is
a
slow
and
costly
business
even
with
our
improved
instruments
tell
me
i
said
you
see
i
am
very
ignorant
of
art
as
understood
in
meccania
has
literature
been
pursued
by
the
same
scientific
methods
it
depends
upon
what
you
mean
by
literature
replied
madame
blobber
broadly
speaking
i
said
i
mean
the
art
of
expressing
ideas
in
language
that
satisfies
one
sense
of
beauty
all
our
professional
writers
go
through
a
period
of
training
in
the
particular
department
they
cultivate
for
example
our
writers
of
history
are
very
carefully
trained
writers
of
scientific
treatises
also
but
what
of
your
novelists
and
poets
i
asked
we
do
not
specially
encourage
the
writing
of
novels
all
stories
are
merely
variations
of
a
few
themes
all
the
stories
worth
writing
have
been
written
long
ago
we
print
a
certain
number
of
the
old
novels
and
we
employ
a
few
specialists
to
up
new
stories
from
the
old
materials
chiefly
for
the
benefit
of
the
lower
classes
we
meccanians
never
really
took
to
except
under
foreign
influence
and
that
passed
away
long
ago
the
theme
of
almost
all
novels
is
domestic
life
and
individual
passion
they
treat
of
phases
of
thought
and
feeling
that
our
culture
tends
more
and
more
to
make
obsolete
we
have
developed
the
drama
much
more
in
fact
the
drama
takes
the
place
of
the
novel
with
us
i
have
heard
something
of
your
drama
from
dodderer
i
said
indeed
then
you
understand
the
fourfold
treatment
that
in
itself
would
explain
why
we
have
discarded
the
novel
we
still
keep
up
the
philosophical
parable
which
is
a
sort
of
link
between
the
novel
and
our
modern
drama
i
am
afraid
i
should
find
it
difficult
to
appreciate
some
of
your
plays
i
said
for
instance
that
is
only
because
our
mental
environment
is
in
advance
of
the
rest
of
europe
physical
science
including
of
course
medical
science
is
part
of
our
mental
furniture
we
have
assimilated
whole
masses
of
ideas
that
are
still
unfamiliar
to
other
peoples
naturally
our
drama
finds
its
material
in
the
affairs
that
interest
us
and
poetry
i
said
is
poetry
still
cultivated
naturally
most
of
our
dramas
are
in
poetry
our
language
lends
itself
admirably
it
is
almost
as
easy
to
write
poetry
as
prose
in
our
language
but
is
there
no
lyrical
poetry
certainly
we
utilise
it
as
one
of
the
means
of
cultivating
the
meccanian
spirit
especially
among
the
young
no
poetry
is
published
unless
it
contributes
to
the
uplifting
of
the
meccanian
spirit
at
this
point
director
blobber
woke
up
and
proposed
that
we
should
retire
to
his
study
for
a
glass
of
spirits
and
a
cigar
madame
blobber
left
us
and
for
the
next
i
did
my
best
to
keep
blobber
awake
but
it
was
evident
he
wanted
to
go
to
bed
and
by
nine
i
left
the
house
without
any
desire
to
see
either
of
my
hosts
again
two
days
later
i
received
another
invitation
this
time
to
dine
with
an
of
the
ministry
for
foreign
affairs
i
had
not
presented
any
letters
of
introduction
to
him
i
could
therefore
only
suspect
that
this
invitation
was
in
some
way
due
to
kwang
i
went
of
course
but
i
could
hardly
help
wondering
what
was
in
store
for
me
count
krafft
belonged
to
one
of
the
great
families
and
wore
the
uniform
of
the
second
class
with
a
badge
to
indicate
that
he
was
now
in
the
civil
service
although
of
course
he
had
served
as
an
officer
in
the
army
his
wife
was
apparently
dining
elsewhere
for
i
saw
no
sign
of
her
and
we
dined
in
a
small
apartment
in
his
large
mansion
in
the
second
quarter
he
was
much
more
a
man
of
the
world
than
the
others
i
had
met
and
in
his
manners
resembled
the
men
of
good
family
whom
i
had
met
in
luniland
after
a
short
preliminary
talk
about
nothing
in
particular
he
said
he
was
sorry
that
he
had
not
learnt
of
my
presence
in
mecco
when
i
first
arrived
particularly
as
i
was
a
friend
of
kwang
the
applications
from
foreigners
for
permission
to
travel
in
meccania
he
said
by
way
of
apology
are
not
very
numerous
and
they
are
always
referred
to
me
for
my
signature
yours
reached
us
from
luniland
and
was
regarded
as
that
of
a
mere
it
is
a
pity
you
did
not
give
the
name
of
your
friend
kwang
as
a
reference
we
think
very
highly
of
kwang
and
i
should
be
pleased
to
give
special
facilities
to
any
of
his
friends
i
do
suppose
you
have
been
neglected
he
added
our
officials
have
instructions
to
pay
attention
to
the
comfort
of
all
foreign
observers
and
i
am
sure
we
do
more
for
them
than
any
government
i
am
acquainted
with
we
were
by
this
time
about
through
dinner
and
under
its
influence
i
ventured
upon
a
mild
joke
you
do
everything
for
them
i
said
except
leave
them
alone
he
took
this
in
good
part
you
have
been
in
luniland
he
remarked
where
every
one
does
what
he
pleases
when
you
have
spent
as
long
a
time
here
you
will
appreciate
the
wisdom
of
our
arrangements
no
doubt
it
seems
a
little
irksome
at
first
and
perhaps
rather
dull
especially
as
you
have
seen
only
the
mere
routine
aspects
of
the
life
of
the
lower
and
middle
classes
i
use
the
terms
you
see
but
how
else
would
you
arrange
matters
we
can
not
invite
all
foreign
visitors
indiscriminately
to
take
part
in
our
higher
social
life
and
it
would
not
be
fair
to
our
own
citizens
to
allow
foreigners
a
greater
liberty
than
we
allow
to
ourselves
so
you
put
us
in
a
i
said
laughing
because
you
have
to
put
your
whole
nation
in
a
our
whole
nation
in
a
he
replied
with
a
smile
so
that
is
how
it
strikes
you
is
it
well
is
it
so
i
said
your
children
are
sorted
out
while
they
are
at
school
their
play
is
turned
into
useful
employment
their
careers
are
decided
for
them
hardly
any
of
them
rise
out
of
their
original
class
then
everybody
is
under
the
eye
of
the
time
department
everybody
is
inspected
and
looked
after
from
the
cradle
to
the
grave
it
is
almost
impossible
to
commit
a
real
crime
or
to
set
up
any
independent
institution
there
is
you
must
admit
a
certain
want
of
freedom
in
your
arrangements
but
of
what
people
are
you
speaking
said
count
krafft
you
seem
to
have
confined
your
attention
to
the
lower
classes
for
them
in
all
countries
something
of
a
is
needed
surely
certainly
it
is
for
ours
we
know
our
own
people
when
they
are
properly
drilled
and
led
they
do
wonders
but
left
to
themselves
they
have
always
relapsed
into
laziness
and
barbarism
or
else
have
burst
out
into
anarchy
and
revolutionary
fury
but
what
scope
does
your
system
allow
for
their
energies
i
asked
every
aspect
of
life
seems
confined
by
your
meticulous
regulations
that
is
an
illusion
he
replied
you
see
we
are
a
highly
intellectual
people
and
it
is
quite
natural
for
us
to
formulate
regulations
modern
life
is
necessarily
complex
and
the
chief
difference
between
us
and
other
nations
is
that
we
recognise
the
complexity
and
organise
our
activities
accordingly
we
are
simply
in
advance
of
other
nations
that
is
all
take
a
simple
thing
like
railways
we
organised
our
railway
system
to
suit
our
national
purposes
instead
of
leaving
them
to
commercial
enterprise
take
the
education
of
the
people
the
state
took
charge
of
it
fifty
years
before
other
nations
recognised
its
vital
importance
take
the
question
of
public
health
even
those
states
which
prate
about
individual
liberty
have
had
to
follow
in
our
wake
and
organise
the
medical
service
besides
it
is
only
by
organising
the
activities
of
the
lower
classes
that
the
state
can
maintain
its
supremacy
i
see
i
replied
the
is
for
the
lower
classes
i
thought
it
was
a
garment
worn
by
everybody
the
expression
was
yours
he
said
with
an
indulgent
smile
we
certainly
do
not
regard
it
as
a
that
is
perhaps
because
the
ruling
classes
do
not
wear
it
i
replied
we
do
not
recognise
any
classes
as
ruling
classes
he
said
suavely
it
is
an
obsolete
expression
but
i
thought
you
liked
to
recognise
facts
and
call
things
by
their
proper
names
i
replied
certainly
we
do
he
answered
but
which
are
the
ruling
classes
the
is
the
supreme
and
only
ruler
in
meccania
even
in
a
i
said
i
should
have
thought
from
what
you
have
said
that
some
groups
of
persons
really
wielded
the
power
of
the
state
under
the
crude
organisation
of
most
foreign
states
that
is
quite
possible
answered
count
krafft
but
the
essence
of
the
is
that
in
it
power
can
not
be
exercised
without
authority
and
only
these
persons
are
authorised
through
whom
the
chooses
to
express
its
will
it
places
everybody
in
such
a
position
as
enables
him
to
render
the
greatest
service
to
the
state
that
he
is
capable
of
rendering
consequently
no
fault
can
be
found
by
any
class
or
section
with
the
power
exercised
by
any
other
class
or
section
because
they
are
merely
the
instruments
of
the
state
itself
that
sounds
a
very
comfortable
doctrine
for
those
who
happen
to
wield
the
power
i
said
it
leaves
no
room
for
any
the
would
not
be
the
if
it
contained
within
it
any
opposition
he
replied
you
ought
to
read
the
speech
of
prince
mechow
on
the
as
the
final
expression
of
the
meccanian
spirit
he
went
on
foreigners
are
apt
to
confuse
the
with
an
autocracy
it
is
essentially
different
in
an
autocracy
of
the
crude
type
an
exterior
power
is
visible
and
your
talk
of
ruling
classes
would
be
appropriate
there
in
the
all
the
functions
are
so
organised
that
the
whole
body
politic
acts
as
one
man
we
educate
the
will
of
the
component
units
in
such
a
way
that
all
conflicting
impulses
are
eradicated
after
all
that
was
the
ideal
of
the
catholic
church
prince
mechow
applied
the
same
principle
when
he
reformed
our
educational
system
a
good
meccanian
would
no
more
seek
to
violate
the
obligations
laid
upon
him
by
the
than
a
good
catholic
would
seek
to
commit
deadly
sin
then
there
is
no
room
for
a
free
press
in
the
i
remarked
he
saw
my
point
and
replied
a
press
as
you
call
it
would
be
an
anachronism
what
necessity
is
there
for
it
its
function
has
disappeared
it
only
existed
during
a
brief
historical
phase
in
the
earlier
development
of
the
modern
state
our
great
prince
bludiron
was
the
first
to
perceive
its
inconsistency
with
the
line
of
true
development
prince
mechow
absorbed
all
the
functions
of
the
independent
professions
and
among
them
those
of
the
journalists
who
were
always
an
element
of
weakness
in
the
state
but
what
then
is
the
object
of
this
complete
unity
which
as
far
as
i
can
make
out
the
seems
always
to
be
aiming
at
i
asked
the
object
he
replied
almost
bored
by
my
pertinacity
unity
is
the
law
of
all
organic
life
we
are
simply
more
advanced
in
our
development
than
other
states
that
is
all
then
it
is
not
true
that
all
this
is
for
the
purpose
of
fostering
national
power
i
said
that
is
the
old
argument
of
the
weak
against
the
strong
the
poor
against
the
rich
the
ignorant
against
the
educated
every
healthy
person
is
a
strong
person
the
rich
man
is
stronger
than
the
poor
man
the
educated
man
is
stronger
than
the
ignorant
the
modern
state
even
among
our
neighbours
is
infinitely
than
the
incoherent
political
organisms
of
earlier
times
it
can
not
help
itself
its
resources
are
enormously
greater
how
can
the
help
being
strong
no
state
deliberately
seeks
to
weaken
itself
or
deprive
itself
of
its
natural
force
then
as
if
tired
of
the
discussion
into
which
our
conversation
had
led
us
he
said
but
these
are
all
matters
about
which
you
will
learn
much
more
from
my
friend
the
professor
of
state
science
i
am
afraid
i
have
been
dishing
up
one
of
his
old
lectures
you
will
find
this
liqueur
quite
palatable
we
then
drifted
on
to
more
trivial
topics
he
said
i
had
spent
too
long
among
the
petty
officials
grubbing
about
with
my
tour
no
i
ought
to
see
something
of
better
society
unfortunately
it
was
the
dead
season
just
then
and
i
might
have
to
wait
a
little
time
but
there
were
still
some
dinners
at
the
university
some
of
the
professors
never
went
out
of
mecco
and
would
be
glad
to
entertain
me
we
parted
on
very
good
terms
his
manner
had
been
friendly
and
if
he
had
done
little
besides
expound
meccanian
principles
he
had
at
any
rate
not
been
dictatorial
i
wondered
whether
he
really
believed
in
his
own
plausible
theories
or
whether
he
had
been
simply
instructing
the
foreign
observer
when
i
saw
kwang
a
day
or
two
afterwards
this
time
alone
he
greeted
me
cordially
and
said
so
things
are
improving
they
promise
to
do
so
i
said
but
so
far
all
that
has
happened
has
been
a
very
tedious
visit
to
director
blobber
and
an
academic
discussion
with
count
krafft
so
you
do
appreciate
the
honour
of
dining
with
an
of
the
he
said
you
have
stayed
too
long
in
luniland
i
am
promised
the
privilege
of
seeing
something
of
the
best
meccanian
society
but
what
i
was
more
anxious
to
see
was
the
worst
meccanian
society
they
will
take
care
you
do
he
answered
laughing
but
why
in
any
other
country
one
can
associate
with
peasants
or
vagabonds
or
artisans
or
tradesmen
or
business
men
you
ought
to
know
by
this
time
i
am
sure
it
has
been
explained
to
you
over
and
over
again
you
would
gather
false
impressions
and
you
might
contaminate
the
delicate
fruits
of
meccanian
culture
that
is
the
theory
i
have
heard
but
there
is
nothing
in
it
why
not
because
by
keeping
us
apart
they
arouse
the
suspicions
of
both
oh
no
they
may
arouse
suspicions
but
the
meccanian
knows
that
what
the
state
prescribes
for
him
must
be
for
his
good
this
is
the
only
country
where
theories
are
carried
into
practice
it
is
a
and
you
admire
it
you
have
become
a
proselyte
i
said
jokingly
have
you
read
my
books
yet
he
asked
i
saw
one
for
the
first
time
this
week
i
said
well
i
recognise
it
as
a
masterpiece
he
bowed
and
smiled
from
the
president
of
the
literary
society
that
is
high
praise
indeed
i
am
undecided
whether
to
remain
here
longer
i
said
or
to
return
home
perhaps
calling
for
a
rest
and
a
change
to
see
my
friends
in
lunopolis
i
should
like
your
advice
of
course
that
depends
upon
circumstances
i
do
not
yet
understand
your
difficulty
or
the
circumstances
well
i
said
i
came
here
prepared
to
stay
perhaps
a
year
if
i
liked
the
country
with
the
intention
of
obtaining
general
impressions
and
some
definite
information
on
matters
in
which
i
am
interested
but
every
meccanian
i
have
met
is
either
a
government
agent
or
a
bore
what
even
madame
blobber
he
interposed
smiling
even
madame
blobber
i
said
i
am
getting
tired
of
it
i
try
all
sorts
of
means
to
gratify
my
perfectly
innocent
curiosity
and
am
baffled
every
time
now
i
am
promised
a
sight
of
high
society
but
i
expect
they
will
show
me
what
they
want
me
to
see
and
nothing
they
do
want
me
to
see
why
should
they
show
you
what
they
do
want
you
to
see
he
laughed
i
do
know
how
you
stand
it
i
said
i
have
had
the
virtue
of
patience
he
said
and
patience
has
been
rewarded
i
too
am
going
home
before
long
i
have
got
what
i
want
he
made
the
signal
that
bound
me
to
absolute
secrecy
and
told
me
what
his
plans
were
when
i
said
that
he
ran
a
risk
of
being
victimised
he
shook
his
head
i
am
not
afraid
he
said
by
the
time
i
reach
home
every
meccanian
agent
in
china
will
have
been
quietly
deported
and
they
will
not
come
back
again
we
are
not
a
but
our
country
is
not
idiotica
and
in
the
meantime
i
said
suppose
i
stay
here
another
month
or
so
what
do
you
advise
me
to
do
oh
just
amuse
yourself
as
well
as
you
can
he
said
amuse
myself
in
meccania
yes
it
is
not
worth
while
trying
now
to
do
anything
else
you
will
find
out
nothing
new
nothing
that
i
have
not
already
found
out
it
takes
ten
years
to
penetrate
beneath
the
surface
here
even
with
my
methods
he
said
but
i
have
got
what
i
want
and
how
am
i
to
amuse
myself
accept
all
the
invitations
you
get
keep
your
ears
open
and
use
your
own
considerable
powers
of
reflection
by
way
of
relief
come
and
talk
to
me
whenever
you
want
i
followed
advice
i
gave
up
all
thought
of
investigating
either
meccanian
politics
or
problems
or
anything
of
the
kind
i
thought
i
should
probably
get
better
information
at
second
hand
from
kwang
than
i
could
get
at
first
hand
for
myself
in
the
short
time
that
i
was
prepared
to
stay
and
i
am
satisfied
now
that
i
decided
rightly
i
saw
lickrod
almost
daily
and
went
with
him
to
a
number
of
places
museums
the
great
library
industrial
exhibitions
manufactories
and
so
forth
we
spent
a
day
or
two
looking
at
examples
of
meccanian
architecture
which
was
more
interesting
from
the
engineering
point
of
view
than
from
the
artistic
i
began
to
receive
invitations
to
several
houses
chiefly
of
high
officials
in
the
civil
service
and
one
or
two
members
of
the
higher
bourgeoisie
in
the
meantime
i
had
some
interesting
conversation
with
my
friends
johnson
and
villele
as
we
sat
in
the
garden
after
dinner
i
had
never
yet
asked
johnson
why
he
was
pursuing
what
i
could
not
help
thinking
was
the
distasteful
study
of
meccanian
pedagogics
but
as
lickrod
had
recommended
me
to
talk
to
johnson
about
meccanian
education
the
question
came
up
naturally
i
put
it
to
him
quite
frankly
you
are
what
i
should
describe
as
an
by
temperament
i
said
and
it
seems
very
odd
that
you
should
be
studying
meccanian
pedagogics
of
all
things
in
the
world
it
is
because
i
am
an
as
you
put
it
that
i
am
doing
so
he
replied
you
see
in
luniland
we
never
do
things
thoroughly
thank
god
and
we
have
no
pedagogical
system
but
every
now
and
then
a
sort
of
movement
arises
in
favour
of
some
reform
or
other
for
a
long
time
meccanian
education
was
out
of
court
people
would
hear
of
nothing
that
savoured
of
meccania
good
or
bad
then
there
was
a
revival
of
interest
and
societies
were
started
to
promote
what
they
called
education
on
a
scientific
basis
by
which
they
meant
not
the
study
of
science
but
meccanian
education
as
professor
of
education
in
one
of
our
smaller
universities
i
was
obliged
to
take
some
line
or
other
and
the
more
i
studied
meccanian
education
from
books
the
less
i
liked
it
so
i
came
to
equip
myself
with
a
better
knowledge
of
the
whole
thing
than
the
cranks
who
have
taken
it
up
i
suppose
you
find
some
things
worth
copying
i
suggested
in
a
field
so
wide
especially
seeing
that
they
have
applied
psychological
science
to
methods
of
study
oh
yes
there
are
certain
pedagogical
tricks
and
dodges
that
are
decidedly
clever
in
fact
if
the
human
race
were
a
race
of
clever
insects
the
meccanian
system
of
education
would
be
almost
perfect
the
pupils
store
up
knowledge
as
bees
store
honey
and
they
learn
to
perform
their
functions
as
members
of
an
organisation
with
wonderful
accuracy
i
can
not
help
thinking
sometimes
that
meccania
is
a
society
of
clever
insects
exactly
struck
in
villele
there
are
the
soldier
ants
and
the
slave
ants
and
the
official
ants
and
the
ants
we
ought
to
call
meccania
the
eh
yes
the
land
of
the
said
johnson
no
person
in
meccania
certainly
no
child
is
ever
looked
upon
as
an
in
itself
he
is
simply
one
of
a
community
of
ants
of
course
i
said
to
be
quite
fair
we
can
not
consider
anybody
strictly
as
an
end
in
himself
even
in
luniland
theoretically
that
is
so
replied
johnson
but
in
practice
it
makes
all
the
difference
in
the
world
whether
you
regard
a
man
as
an
individual
soul
or
as
a
cell
in
an
organism
or
a
wheel
in
a
machine
why
do
you
lunilanders
and
francarians
if
i
may
ask
such
a
large
question
allow
yourselves
to
be
influenced
at
all
by
what
is
done
in
meccania
there
is
so
little
intercourse
between
the
countries
that
it
hardly
seems
worth
while
having
any
at
all
i
said
because
in
both
countries
there
are
still
many
people
who
regard
the
meccanians
not
as
but
as
human
beings
answered
johnson
and
there
is
always
too
the
ultimate
possibility
of
conflict
if
they
were
on
another
planet
it
would
not
matter
providing
they
could
invent
no
means
of
communicating
with
us
in
itself
meccanian
education
is
of
little
interest
except
of
course
as
education
in
the
insect
world
might
be
interesting
or
perhaps
as
a
branch
of
pedagogical
pathology
or
psychological
pathology
in
effect
interrupted
villele
it
all
comes
back
to
what
johnson
was
saying
a
few
nights
ago
that
the
key
to
the
whole
polity
of
meccania
is
military
power
meccanian
education
is
merely
a
means
to
that
end
just
as
the
time
department
and
every
other
institution
and
the
absence
of
certain
other
institutions
like
the
press
for
example
is
the
is
the
grand
instrument
of
militarism
is
it
not
possible
i
said
that
the
real
key
to
the
is
the
desire
of
the
ruling
classes
to
keep
themselves
in
power
but
the
two
things
go
together
answered
villele
the
meccanian
maxim
is
that
state
must
be
strong
within
in
order
to
be
strong
without
and
is
not
that
true
doctrine
i
said
wondering
how
they
would
answer
the
argument
to
a
certain
extent
answered
johnson
cautiously
but
where
are
their
enemies
why
should
they
want
all
this
they
say
they
are
surrounded
by
unfriendly
nations
i
replied
so
they
are
answered
villele
but
they
have
done
their
best
to
make
them
unfriendly
if
you
knock
a
man
down
and
trample
on
him
and
rob
him
into
the
bargain
you
can
hardly
expect
him
to
be
a
friendly
neighbour
next
day
we
started
by
talking
about
education
i
remarked
but
we
have
very
soon
got
into
a
discussion
about
militarism
somehow
we
seem
to
get
to
that
no
matter
what
point
we
start
from
and
with
very
good
reason
said
villele
there
used
to
be
a
saying
that
all
roads
lead
to
rome
in
meccania
all
roads
lead
to
militarism
you
who
are
not
faced
by
the
problem
it
presents
may
regard
it
as
an
obsession
but
a
man
who
refuses
to
admit
the
plainest
evidence
is
also
the
victim
of
an
obsession
and
you
think
the
evidence
is
unmistakable
i
said
for
what
purpose
does
the
meccanian
parliament
if
it
can
be
called
a
parliament
surrender
its
control
over
taxation
for
what
purpose
does
the
government
conceal
its
expenditure
upon
army
and
navy
for
what
purpose
does
it
destroy
the
freedom
of
the
press
and
freedom
of
speech
for
what
purpose
does
the
government
keep
every
person
under
supervision
for
what
purpose
does
it
control
all
production
i
can
not
answer
these
questions
i
said
but
what
evidence
is
there
that
the
meccanian
system
of
education
is
designed
as
part
of
the
scheme
of
militarism
the
evidence
is
abundant
answered
johnson
but
it
is
not
so
plain
as
to
be
unmistakable
if
you
see
one
of
our
elaborate
pieces
of
modern
machinery
a
or
a
you
will
find
that
it
contains
a
thousand
separate
contrivances
and
unless
you
are
an
expert
you
will
not
be
able
to
perceive
that
every
part
is
absolutely
necessary
to
the
performance
of
the
simple
function
of
printing
or
spinning
yet
that
is
the
fact
it
is
just
the
same
with
the
meccanian
educational
machine
its
chief
purpose
according
to
the
meccanian
theory
is
to
enable
the
citizen
or
as
villele
and
i
might
say
the
to
perform
his
functions
as
a
member
of
the
community
but
the
chief
end
of
the
state
is
power
the
meccanians
say
so
themselves
anyhow
we
can
easily
see
for
ourselves
that
their
system
of
education
fits
in
exactly
with
militarism
it
makes
men
efficient
for
the
purposes
required
of
them
by
the
it
makes
them
not
only
docile
and
obedient
but
actively
devoted
to
the
interests
not
of
themselves
individually
but
of
what
they
are
taught
to
regard
as
something
more
important
namely
the
it
fosters
the
superstition
which
makes
possible
such
an
incredible
custom
as
villele
has
told
you
of
it
keeps
them
ignorant
of
all
other
ideals
of
civilisation
all
that
may
be
true
i
replied
it
may
very
well
be
that
the
system
of
education
does
favour
militarism
but
it
may
not
have
been
deliberately
designed
to
that
end
it
has
been
put
to
me
i
added
that
all
this
elaborate
organisation
including
education
is
part
of
the
inevitable
tendency
of
things
in
the
modern
world
and
that
the
meccanians
are
only
doing
a
little
in
advance
of
other
people
what
they
will
all
do
sooner
or
later
that
wo
do
at
all
interposed
villele
they
can
not
have
it
both
ways
what
becomes
of
the
genius
of
prince
mechow
if
it
is
all
an
inevitable
tendency
they
tell
us
other
nations
are
not
clever
enough
or
not
enough
or
not
enough
to
produce
such
a
system
these
reforms
had
to
be
introduced
in
the
teeth
of
opposition
other
nations
have
not
adopted
them
and
will
not
adopt
them
except
under
the
pressure
of
fear
it
is
militarism
alone
that
is
strong
enough
to
impose
such
a
system
but
said
i
i
find
it
difficult
to
believe
that
any
civilisation
even
meccanian
can
be
really
the
result
of
the
domination
of
a
single
idea
not
even
the
communities
of
the
ancient
world
were
so
simple
in
their
principles
that
fact
tells
in
favour
of
our
contention
answered
villele
how
so
i
said
why
you
admit
the
natural
tendency
of
all
civilised
peoples
towards
diversity
of
aims
the
more
highly
developed
the
more
diversified
if
therefore
you
find
a
people
becoming
less
diversified
subordinating
all
individual
wills
to
the
will
of
the
state
you
must
suspect
some
extraordinary
force
you
would
not
deny
the
fact
that
individual
liberty
has
been
suppressed
no
i
said
i
do
not
deny
that
but
you
think
the
has
such
an
interest
in
the
tender
plant
of
the
individual
souls
of
its
children
their
moral
and
spiritual
and
physical
life
that
it
is
merely
a
meticulous
grandmother
trying
to
prepare
them
all
for
a
better
world
eh
i
laughed
no
that
wo
do
only
two
things
are
strong
enough
to
suppress
the
spirit
of
liberty
one
is
superstition
calling
itself
religion
the
other
is
militarism
if
it
were
less
well
done
resumed
johnson
it
would
be
easier
to
detect
but
it
is
diabolically
well
done
who
but
the
meccanians
would
think
it
worth
while
to
control
the
whole
teaching
of
history
for
the
sake
of
cultivating
militarism
in
most
countries
anybody
may
write
history
although
very
few
people
read
it
here
only
the
official
historians
may
write
only
the
books
prescribed
by
the
state
may
be
read
and
all
the
people
while
they
are
at
school
and
college
must
read
it
in
this
way
they
create
a
powerful
tradition
one
need
not
laugh
at
the
idea
of
state
historians
they
have
done
their
work
too
well
for
that
their
falsification
of
history
is
not
a
clumsy
affair
of
inventing
fairy
tales
it
is
scientific
falsification
they
utilise
every
fact
that
can
tell
against
or
discredit
other
nations
and
every
fact
about
their
own
people
which
can
raise
their
national
the
method
is
not
new
for
you
may
say
that
all
historians
are
biased
but
in
other
countries
the
bias
of
one
historian
is
counterbalanced
by
the
bias
of
others
the
is
not
new
but
the
is
as
an
example
take
their
treatment
of
a
luniland
statesman
of
the
beginning
of
the
last
century
and
this
is
a
fairly
harmless
instance
he
was
undoubtedly
a
man
a
patriot
who
was
also
a
good
european
for
he
did
as
much
as
any
one
man
to
save
europe
from
a
military
tyranny
but
he
shared
many
of
the
current
ideas
of
his
age
and
lived
according
to
its
customs
in
history
all
we
are
told
of
him
is
that
he
drank
heavily
gambled
persecuted
ignorant
and
misguided
labourers
bribed
the
people
representatives
enriched
capitalists
and
landlords
by
his
fiscal
system
and
displayed
his
ignorance
of
finance
by
inventing
a
fallacious
sinking
fund
that
any
schoolboy
could
see
through
johnson
is
putting
the
case
much
too
mildly
interposed
villele
there
are
in
the
issued
by
the
government
on
all
sorts
of
matters
but
particularly
with
regard
to
foreign
affairs
falsifications
of
fact
of
the
most
barefaced
character
now
the
writers
of
the
school
and
college
histories
quote
very
extensively
from
these
official
reports
implying
always
that
the
statements
are
true
further
than
this
you
know
but
not
perhaps
as
well
as
we
do
that
in
countries
where
speech
is
free
and
the
press
is
free
there
are
any
number
of
libellous
writers
who
vilify
their
opponents
in
a
shameless
fashion
in
luniland
in
particular
if
my
friend
will
pardon
my
saying
so
there
are
enthusiasts
for
some
particular
cause
who
have
no
sense
whatever
of
proportion
for
instance
to
hear
some
of
the
temperance
advocates
you
would
imagine
that
the
lunilanders
were
a
nation
of
drunkards
seducers
abandoned
wretches
of
every
kind
to
listen
to
their
socialist
fanatics
you
would
imagine
that
every
working
man
was
a
slave
to
listen
to
their
you
would
imagine
that
the
whole
medical
profession
spent
its
leisure
in
the
sport
of
torturing
animals
to
listen
to
some
of
the
priests
you
would
think
the
whole
nation
was
sunk
in
vice
to
listen
to
the
you
would
think
the
priests
were
a
tribe
of
grasping
hypocrites
and
so
on
and
so
on
now
you
will
find
meccanian
histories
and
works
on
the
social
and
political
life
of
foreign
nations
full
of
quotations
from
such
writers
as
i
said
at
the
outset
remarked
johnson
this
may
seem
a
little
thing
in
itself
but
it
is
symptomatic
and
characteristic
look
at
an
entirely
different
aspect
of
the
system
the
whole
teaching
profession
is
honeycombed
with
sycophancy
every
teacher
is
a
spy
upon
every
other
every
one
tries
to
show
his
zeal
and
gain
some
promotion
by
a
display
of
the
meccanian
spirit
as
you
know
there
are
no
private
schools
there
is
not
a
single
independent
teacher
in
the
whole
country
it
is
in
the
universities
even
more
than
in
the
schools
that
sycophancy
runs
riot
that
may
be
perfectly
true
i
said
but
would
you
not
get
this
disease
of
sycophancy
wherever
you
have
a
bureaucracy
quite
apart
from
militarism
suppose
there
were
no
army
at
all
but
suppose
that
the
state
were
the
sole
employer
and
controller
of
every
person
and
thing
you
might
still
have
all
the
petty
tyranny
and
sycophancy
that
you
describe
but
there
is
a
difference
said
johnson
under
a
mere
bureaucracy
it
is
still
possible
for
the
large
groups
of
workers
to
combine
and
very
effectually
to
safeguard
their
interests
especially
if
at
the
same
time
there
is
a
real
parliamentary
system
indeed
many
years
ago
one
of
the
strongest
arguments
brought
forward
in
luniland
against
any
large
extension
of
state
employment
was
that
the
employees
through
their
trade
combinations
would
be
able
to
exert
political
pressure
and
rather
exploit
the
state
than
be
exploited
by
it
no
i
maintain
that
a
military
autocracy
without
a
bureaucracy
may
be
brutal
and
tyrannical
in
a
spasmodic
sort
of
way
but
it
is
and
clumsy
a
bureaucracy
apart
from
a
military
control
of
the
state
may
be
meddlesome
and
irritating
but
it
is
only
when
you
get
the
two
combined
that
the
people
are
bound
hand
and
foot
anyhow
i
can
not
conceive
of
the
whole
teaching
profession
including
the
highest
as
well
as
the
lowest
branches
being
so
completely
enslaved
as
it
is
here
without
there
being
a
driving
power
at
the
back
of
the
bureaucratic
machine
such
as
only
militarism
can
supply
in
our
times
for
religion
is
out
of
the
question
well
now
is
there
any
other
sort
of
evidence
i
said
that
the
educational
system
is
inspired
by
militarism
so
far
the
case
is
proven
the
cultivation
of
meccanian
spirit
which
is
one
of
the
prime
aims
of
all
the
teaching
points
at
any
rate
in
the
same
direction
but
the
meccanian
spirit
is
only
another
name
for
patriotism
is
it
not
i
said
your
scepticism
remarked
villele
would
almost
make
one
suppose
you
were
becoming
a
convert
to
meccanianism
not
at
all
i
said
i
have
tried
to
get
firsthand
information
on
these
matters
and
i
have
failed
here
i
am
listening
to
you
who
are
avowedly
if
i
may
say
so
in
your
presence
they
both
nodded
assent
would
it
not
be
foolish
of
me
to
accept
your
views
without
at
any
rate
sifting
the
evidence
as
fully
as
i
am
able
it
has
this
advantage
i
shall
be
much
more
likely
to
become
convinced
of
the
correctness
of
your
opinions
if
i
find
that
you
meet
the
hypothetical
objections
i
raise
than
if
i
merely
listen
to
your
views
the
meccanian
spirit
is
another
name
for
patriotism
said
johnson
but
it
is
meccanian
patriotism
patriotism
is
not
a
substitute
for
ethics
in
the
rest
of
europe
nor
was
it
in
meccania
two
centuries
ago
absolute
obedience
to
the
state
is
definitely
inculcated
here
no
form
of
resistance
is
possible
resistance
is
never
dreamt
of
the
meccanian
spirit
implies
active
with
the
not
passive
obedience
only
but
reverence
and
devotion
and
remember
that
the
when
you
probe
under
the
surface
the
second
class
the
military
but
do
not
all
states
inculcate
obedience
to
themselves
i
said
no
replied
johnson
bluntly
they
may
inculcate
obedience
to
the
laws
for
the
time
being
it
is
only
churches
claiming
divine
inspiration
that
arrogate
to
themselves
infallibility
and
demand
unconditional
obedience
in
the
rest
of
europe
the
state
is
one
of
the
organs
a
most
necessary
and
important
organ
of
the
community
here
the
state
or
the
is
the
divinity
in
which
society
lives
and
moves
and
has
its
being
it
is
omnipresent
omniscient
omnipotent
admitting
all
you
say
about
the
deliberate
policy
of
the
i
answered
is
it
not
strange
that
a
hundred
millions
of
people
submit
themselves
to
it
and
that
even
outside
meccania
there
are
many
advocates
of
meccanian
principles
tyrannies
have
flourished
in
the
world
in
every
age
replied
johnson
because
there
is
something
even
worse
than
tyranny
to
escape
a
plague
a
man
will
take
refuge
in
a
prison
anarchy
such
as
that
which
broke
out
in
idiotica
some
fifty
years
ago
was
a
godsend
to
the
rulers
of
meccania
they
persuaded
the
public
that
there
was
a
choice
only
between
the
and
anarchy
or
bolshevism
as
it
was
then
called
we
know
that
is
false
liberty
may
be
attacked
by
an
open
enemy
or
by
a
secret
and
loathsome
disease
but
that
is
no
reason
for
surrendering
either
to
the
one
or
the
other
chapter
xi
an
academic
discussion
it
was
some
days
after
this
conversation
with
my
friends
at
the
hotel
that
i
was
present
at
a
given
by
the
president
of
mecco
university
there
were
about
thirty
guests
so
that
at
table
a
general
conversation
was
almost
impossible
i
could
hear
only
what
was
said
by
those
close
to
me
i
was
seated
between
a
member
of
the
diplomatic
corps
and
a
general
general
wolf
a
old
gentleman
with
a
large
coarse
face
and
a
double
chin
seemed
rather
disappointed
that
i
could
not
discuss
with
him
the
higher
mathematics
he
deplored
the
neglect
of
mathematics
in
meccania
he
admitted
that
unless
a
person
had
a
mathematical
brain
it
was
useless
to
attempt
to
make
him
a
mathematician
but
he
said
the
eugenics
section
of
the
health
department
was
not
sufficiently
alive
to
the
importance
of
improving
the
mathematical
stock
he
railed
very
bitterly
against
a
member
of
the
eugenics
board
who
had
tried
to
get
authority
to
improve
the
supply
of
artists
happily
the
board
had
turned
down
his
proposals
count
hardflogg
who
wore
the
mechow
whisker
and
an
eyeglass
and
frowned
fiercely
at
everything
one
said
to
him
was
full
of
a
recent
report
by
the
experts
in
the
industrial
psychology
section
of
the
department
of
industry
and
commerce
it
seems
they
had
recommended
a
shortening
of
hours
for
the
members
of
the
sixth
and
fifth
classes
in
a
number
of
provincial
towns
to
bring
them
more
on
a
level
with
the
same
class
of
workers
in
mecco
itself
he
said
it
was
the
thin
end
of
the
wedge
that
they
ought
not
to
have
reported
until
experiments
had
been
made
with
a
different
diet
he
blamed
the
eugenics
section
too
for
not
being
able
to
produce
a
tougher
strain
of
workers
reduction
of
working
hours
should
not
be
resorted
to
he
maintained
until
every
other
expedient
had
been
tried
it
was
so
very
difficult
to
increase
them
afterwards
besides
in
the
strenuous
month
it
had
been
proved
over
and
over
again
that
the
men
could
easily
stand
a
longer
working
day
without
physical
injury
and
what
is
the
strenuous
month
i
asked
oh
of
course
he
said
you
have
not
studied
our
industrial
system
as
a
factor
of
military
organisation
there
is
a
very
good
account
of
it
in
kwang
of
meccanian
briefly
it
is
this
every
year
but
not
always
in
the
same
month
the
signal
is
given
for
the
strenuous
month
to
begin
the
workmen
then
work
at
top
speed
and
for
as
many
hours
a
day
as
the
industrial
psychologists
determine
for
thirty
days
consecutively
it
is
excellent
training
and
incidentally
has
a
very
good
effect
on
the
output
for
the
other
months
of
the
year
the
men
are
so
glad
when
it
is
over
that
unconsciously
they
work
better
for
the
rest
of
the
year
but
i
should
have
thought
they
would
be
so
fatigued
that
you
would
lose
as
much
as
you
gain
or
more
perhaps
i
said
oh
no
he
answered
they
are
allowed
one
day
complete
rest
which
they
must
spend
in
bed
their
diet
is
arranged
both
during
the
time
and
for
a
month
after
they
must
go
to
bed
for
two
hours
extra
every
night
for
the
following
month
the
effect
is
most
beneficial
they
like
it
too
on
the
whole
for
they
get
paid
for
all
the
extra
product
that
is
to
say
it
is
added
to
their
pension
fund
but
i
thought
the
pension
fund
was
so
calculated
i
said
that
it
tallies
exactly
with
what
is
required
for
the
support
of
each
man
from
the
time
he
ceases
to
be
able
to
work
certainly
he
replied
after
most
of
our
men
work
an
hour
a
day
less
every
two
years
with
variations
according
to
their
capacity
as
tested
by
the
medical
examinations
then
how
do
they
benefit
i
asked
by
the
product
of
the
strenuous
month
if
it
is
only
added
to
their
pension
and
not
paid
at
the
time
if
it
is
added
to
the
pension
fund
he
replied
it
is
obvious
that
they
must
benefit
i
did
not
pursue
the
matter
further
he
asked
me
if
i
had
been
to
the
annual
medical
exhibition
i
said
i
had
not
heard
of
it
and
did
not
suppose
i
should
receive
permission
to
see
it
as
i
was
not
altogether
well
qualified
to
understand
it
he
said
it
was
most
interesting
he
was
not
a
medical
man
himself
of
course
but
as
an
officer
in
the
army
he
had
had
to
get
some
acquaintance
with
physiology
the
medical
menagerie
gets
more
interesting
every
year
he
said
the
medical
menagerie
i
exclaimed
whatever
is
that
it
is
a
wonderful
collection
of
animals
not
only
domestic
but
wild
animals
too
upon
which
experiments
have
been
carried
out
there
are
goats
with
sheep
legs
there
are
cows
with
horses
hearts
and
dogs
with
only
and
pigs
without
livers
oh
all
sorts
of
things
the
funniest
is
a
pig
with
a
tiger
skin
and
what
is
the
object
of
it
all
i
said
oh
just
a
regular
part
of
medical
research
the
most
valuable
experiments
are
those
with
bacilli
of
course
but
only
the
experts
can
understand
these
as
a
rule
but
it
is
not
safe
to
infer
that
the
results
of
experiments
on
animals
will
be
applicable
to
human
beings
i
said
of
course
not
without
further
verification
but
the
special
medical
board
have
ample
powers
to
carry
out
research
what
upon
human
beings
i
exclaimed
people
do
not
always
know
when
they
are
being
experimented
upon
he
remarked
significantly
besides
if
a
man
is
already
suffering
from
an
incurable
disease
what
does
it
matter
of
course
we
use
anæsthetics
wherever
possible
at
least
that
goes
without
saying
after
dinner
we
drank
wine
for
a
little
time
seated
in
little
groups
after
the
manner
of
a
custom
in
some
of
the
colleges
in
luniland
here
instead
of
being
placed
with
the
two
gentlemen
who
had
been
my
neighbours
at
table
i
was
one
of
a
group
of
four
the
others
being
two
professors
and
a
high
official
in
the
sociological
department
one
of
the
professors
was
secret
councillor
an
economist
the
other
was
church
councillor
a
theologian
we
talked
of
indifferent
matters
for
some
time
until
the
high
official
left
us
when
the
idea
occurred
to
me
to
try
whether
the
economist
would
enlighten
me
upon
the
subject
of
the
ultimate
destination
of
the
phenomenal
production
of
the
meccanian
economic
organisation
i
remarked
that
i
had
never
seen
in
any
country
so
few
signs
of
discontent
as
in
meccania
and
i
asked
if
this
was
due
to
the
great
wealth
that
must
necessarily
be
produced
by
the
efficiency
of
the
methods
of
production
professor
the
economist
said
that
my
question
betrayed
that
i
was
not
acquainted
with
the
meccanian
system
of
ethics
i
wondered
why
the
professor
of
economics
should
begin
talking
of
ethics
he
went
on
social
discontent
was
never
really
due
to
lack
of
wealth
properly
speaking
it
has
no
relation
to
material
wealth
at
all
this
has
been
proved
up
to
the
hilt
if
it
needed
any
proof
by
our
researches
in
economic
and
social
history
in
a
nutshell
the
proof
is
this
what
was
called
poverty
in
the
early
nineteenth
century
would
have
been
considered
affluence
in
let
us
say
the
fifth
or
even
the
tenth
century
the
whole
idea
of
wealth
is
subjective
now
anyone
knows
that
where
wealth
is
allowed
to
become
the
main
objective
of
the
social
activities
of
the
people
the
desire
for
individual
wealth
is
insatiable
the
notion
that
you
can
ever
reach
a
state
of
contentment
by
increasing
the
wealth
of
the
people
is
one
of
the
greatest
fallacies
that
even
the
economists
of
luniland
ever
entertained
and
that
is
saying
a
good
deal
consequently
if
we
have
succeeded
in
eradicating
discontent
it
has
not
been
by
pursuing
the
mirage
of
a
popular
el
dorado
no
you
must
replace
the
insane
desire
for
the
gratification
of
individual
indulgence
by
a
conception
of
a
truer
kind
of
if
the
individual
once
grasps
the
fact
that
in
himself
and
by
himself
he
is
little
better
than
an
arboreal
ape
and
that
all
he
possesses
all
he
can
possess
is
the
gift
of
the
state
which
gives
him
nourishment
language
ideas
knowledge
which
trains
him
to
use
his
powers
such
as
they
are
he
will
assume
an
entirely
different
attitude
our
system
of
education
far
more
than
our
system
of
production
is
responsible
for
the
eradication
of
social
and
of
every
other
kind
of
discontent
then
i
suppose
i
said
the
lower
classes
as
we
sometimes
call
them
abroad
your
fifth
and
sixth
and
seventh
classes
for
example
never
inquire
whether
they
receive
what
they
consider
a
fair
share
of
the
national
product
professor
sauer
laughed
aloud
pardon
me
he
said
but
you
remind
me
of
a
story
i
used
to
hear
when
i
was
a
boy
of
a
man
who
had
slept
in
some
cave
or
den
for
fifty
years
or
was
it
a
century
and
woke
up
to
find
a
different
world
such
a
question
belongs
to
the
buried
fossils
of
economic
theory
who
can
say
what
is
a
fair
share
you
might
as
well
ask
whether
one
musical
composition
is
more
just
than
another
well
perhaps
you
can
tell
me
this
i
said
considering
the
superiority
of
your
methods
of
production
i
should
have
expected
to
find
a
much
higher
standard
of
individual
wealth
or
comfort
or
leisure
you
know
what
i
mean
among
not
only
the
lower
classes
but
all
classes
i
can
not
help
wondering
what
becomes
of
all
the
surplus
we
have
all
enough
for
our
needs
he
said
and
the
requirements
of
the
state
are
of
far
more
importance
than
the
gratification
of
the
tastes
of
individuals
may
i
put
in
a
word
said
professor
slimey
the
theologian
in
the
modern
world
the
productive
powers
of
man
have
outstripped
his
other
powers
it
is
one
of
the
mysteries
of
the
ways
of
providence
the
discipline
of
labour
is
necessary
for
the
development
of
the
soul
but
the
devil
has
sought
to
seduce
mankind
by
teaching
him
how
to
produce
more
than
is
good
for
him
in
the
hope
that
he
will
become
corrupted
by
luxury
in
other
countries
that
corruption
has
already
taken
place
the
strenuous
life
is
the
only
life
consistent
with
moral
health
under
the
divine
guidance
our
ruling
classes
i
am
enough
to
use
that
expression
for
in
the
eyes
of
god
there
are
no
first
or
second
classes
have
preserved
the
sense
of
duty
they
are
a
discipline
unto
themselves
god
blessings
have
been
multiplied
unto
them
and
they
have
not
forgotten
the
divine
injunctions
we
can
not
expect
that
the
masses
of
mankind
can
discipline
themselves
and
for
them
the
only
safety
lies
in
and
labour
there
can
be
no
greater
curse
for
a
people
than
idleness
and
luxury
fortunately
we
have
been
able
to
preserve
them
from
the
evil
effects
of
superabundant
wealth
i
have
sometimes
wondered
i
said
whether
the
requirements
of
the
state
in
regard
to
what
is
called
national
defence
were
so
great
as
to
account
for
the
surplus
product
undoubtedly
the
demands
of
the
army
are
very
considerable
replied
sauer
you
must
remember
that
we
have
to
protect
ourselves
against
the
whole
world
so
to
speak
but
no
estimate
has
been
made
i
suppose
of
what
is
required
for
such
things
i
said
that
is
a
matter
of
high
policy
replied
sauer
it
would
be
impossible
to
estimate
for
it
as
a
separate
item
in
national
expenditure
there
again
you
betray
your
lunilandish
conceptions
of
national
finance
no
doubt
they
keep
up
this
practice
still
in
luniland
but
such
a
notion
belongs
to
a
bygone
age
the
state
must
be
able
to
mobilise
all
its
resources
that
is
the
only
logical
policy
if
you
mean
to
conduct
the
affairs
of
the
nation
successfully
not
only
in
time
of
war
but
in
time
of
peace
your
asking
how
much
national
wealth
is
devoted
to
defence
is
like
asking
a
man
how
much
of
his
dinner
is
devoted
to
sustaining
his
religion
but
is
it
not
important
to
be
able
to
form
some
approximate
idea
from
the
economic
point
of
view
i
said
for
in
one
sense
it
represents
so
much
waste
so
much
waste
exclaimed
professor
slimey
indignantly
to
what
nobler
purpose
could
the
energies
of
the
people
be
directed
than
to
the
defence
of
their
emperor
their
god
and
their
fatherland
i
did
not
mean
that
it
might
not
be
necessary
i
replied
but
it
is
like
a
man
who
has
to
build
a
dyke
against
floods
it
may
be
necessary
but
if
he
could
be
sure
that
the
floods
would
not
come
he
could
devote
his
energies
to
something
more
profitable
professor
slimey
shook
his
head
solemnly
no
no
he
said
that
is
another
of
the
fallacies
current
among
foreign
peoples
we
should
sink
to
their
level
if
our
people
had
not
ever
before
them
the
duty
of
serving
god
by
upholding
the
power
of
meccania
his
chosen
nation
indeed
i
often
think
what
a
dispensation
of
providence
it
is
that
it
involves
so
much
labour
imagine
the
state
of
the
common
people
if
they
could
maintain
themselves
by
the
aid
of
a
few
hours
work
a
day
would
there
not
be
so
much
more
scope
for
the
spread
of
your
culture
i
said
in
fact
i
had
been
given
to
understand
that
your
culture
had
reached
such
a
high
level
that
you
could
easily
dispense
with
the
discipline
of
long
hours
of
labour
our
culture
he
replied
speaking
with
authority
is
not
an
individual
culture
at
all
it
must
be
understood
as
a
unity
it
includes
this
very
discipline
of
which
you
seem
to
think
so
lightly
it
includes
the
discipline
of
all
classes
the
monks
of
the
middle
ages
knew
that
idleness
would
undermine
even
their
ideal
of
life
for
they
knew
that
life
is
a
discipline
our
national
culture
is
the
nearest
approach
to
the
christian
ideal
that
any
nation
has
ever
put
into
practice
i
can
not
of
course
speak
with
confidence
upon
such
a
question
i
replied
but
i
thought
the
christian
ideal
was
the
development
of
the
individual
soul
whereas
the
meccanian
ideal
i
speak
under
correction
implies
the
elimination
of
the
individual
soul
everything
must
be
sacrificed
to
the
realisation
of
the
glory
of
the
the
answered
slimey
is
itself
the
great
soul
of
meccania
it
includes
all
the
individual
souls
what
you
call
the
sacrifice
of
the
individual
soul
is
no
real
sacrifice
it
is
merely
a
losing
oneself
to
find
oneself
in
the
larger
soul
of
meccania
and
just
as
the
individual
soul
may
inflict
suffering
on
itself
for
the
sake
of
higher
so
the
of
meccania
may
inflict
suffering
on
the
individual
souls
within
itself
for
the
sake
of
the
higher
the
soul
of
meccania
is
as
wonderful
in
the
spiritual
world
as
the
material
manifestation
of
meccania
is
in
the
material
world
i
am
sure
you
are
right
i
said
although
it
never
struck
me
in
that
light
before
the
soul
of
meccania
is
the
most
wonderful
phenomenon
in
the
history
of
the
world
no
replied
professor
slimey
with
his
solemn
air
it
is
not
phenomenon
it
is
the
thing
in
itself
here
he
paused
to
drink
a
liqueur
then
he
went
on
it
is
purely
spiritual
it
has
existed
from
eternity
and
has
become
clothed
and
manifest
through
the
outward
and
inward
development
of
the
you
foreigners
see
only
the
outward
forms
which
are
merely
symbols
it
is
the
of
meccania
that
is
destined
to
absorb
the
world
of
spirit
as
the
is
destined
to
conquer
the
material
world
professor
gazed
with
his
fishy
eyes
as
if
he
had
heard
all
this
before
some
day
i
said
i
should
like
to
hear
more
of
the
but
while
i
have
the
privilege
of
talking
to
both
of
you
i
should
like
to
learn
some
things
which
probably
only
a
professor
of
economics
can
tell
me
you
as
meccanians
will
pardon
me
i
know
for
seeking
to
acquire
knowledge
they
nodded
assent
i
know
something
of
the
economic
ideas
of
other
nations
in
europe
i
said
but
your
conditions
are
so
different
that
i
am
quite
at
sea
with
regard
to
the
economic
doctrines
of
meccania
what
economic
laws
are
there
within
the
a
very
profound
question
answered
sauer
and
yet
the
answer
is
simple
what
you
have
studied
in
other
countries
is
merely
the
economics
of
free
exchange
as
carried
on
among
peoples
of
a
low
culture
our
economics
have
hardly
anything
in
common
some
of
the
laws
of
production
are
similar
but
beyond
that
our
science
rests
upon
other
principles
our
science
is
based
upon
meccanian
ethics
the
laws
of
demand
have
quite
a
different
meaning
with
us
the
state
determines
the
whole
character
and
volume
of
demand
and
entirely
upon
ethical
grounds
and
distribution
too
i
suppose
naturally
that
is
implied
in
the
regulation
of
demand
the
state
determines
what
each
class
may
spend
and
in
so
doing
determines
both
demand
and
distribution
but
i
was
under
the
impression
that
the
the
third
and
higher
classes
generally
had
much
more
latitude
than
the
lower
classes
in
these
respects
i
said
quite
so
that
again
is
part
of
our
national
ethical
system
just
as
our
economics
are
national
economics
so
our
ethics
are
national
ethics
the
higher
functions
discharged
by
the
higher
classes
demand
a
higher
degree
and
quality
of
consumption
you
will
find
some
most
interesting
researches
upon
this
subject
in
the
reports
of
the
sociological
department
greasey
monograph
on
the
function
of
the
third
is
also
a
masterpiece
in
its
way
and
the
second
class
i
said
they
will
require
still
more
latitude
the
second
class
like
the
first
replied
sauer
stands
outside
and
above
the
purely
economic
aspect
of
society
their
function
is
to
determine
what
the
structure
shall
be
our
business
as
economists
is
to
provide
ways
and
means
no
doubt
they
are
unconsciously
guided
or
shall
i
say
inspired
by
the
workings
of
the
meccanian
spirit
of
which
they
are
the
highest
depositaries
and
all
the
organs
of
the
state
are
at
their
service
to
give
effect
to
their
interpretation
of
the
will
of
the
you
do
not
find
any
tendency
on
their
part
i
suppose
to
make
large
demands
for
themselves
in
the
shape
of
what
we
persist
in
calling
i
said
such
a
question
answered
sauer
does
not
admit
of
any
answer
because
it
involves
a
conception
of
wealth
which
we
have
entirely
discarded
the
second
class
and
with
them
of
course
i
include
the
first
class
for
they
are
indivisible
in
their
functions
and
spirit
exists
for
the
whatever
they
consume
is
consumed
in
the
discharge
of
the
highest
duties
of
the
state
whatever
is
required
by
them
is
simply
part
of
the
necessary
expenditure
of
the
state
but
although
no
limit
is
set
and
who
would
presume
to
set
any
limit
it
is
remarkable
how
little
of
this
expenditure
assumes
the
form
of
personal
consumption
for
the
sake
of
the
dignity
of
the
state
their
life
must
be
conducted
collectively
on
a
magnificent
scale
but
as
you
know
a
dignitary
like
the
pope
may
live
in
the
finest
palace
in
europe
and
yet
be
a
man
of
simple
tastes
and
habits
so
our
noble
class
and
no
nobler
class
has
ever
existed
may
represent
the
glory
of
the
and
yet
be
the
embodiment
of
the
purest
virtues
i
would
go
further
said
professor
slimey
at
this
point
our
noble
second
class
and
of
course
i
associate
the
first
class
with
them
for
in
reality
they
are
all
one
are
the
true
protectors
of
the
state
they
are
the
guardians
of
us
all
have
you
not
noticed
throughout
all
history
that
after
a
successful
war
the
people
are
ready
to
bestow
all
manner
of
honours
and
benefits
upon
those
who
have
saved
their
country
well
i
say
those
who
have
given
us
all
the
glory
and
honour
ay
and
the
spoils
of
victory
too
without
going
to
war
are
as
deserving
of
the
rewards
as
if
they
had
come
back
from
a
long
campaign
we
can
not
honour
them
too
much
besides
it
is
good
for
the
people
to
feel
that
there
is
a
class
upon
whom
they
can
bestow
the
natural
warmth
of
their
affection
and
their
admiration
the
desire
to
bow
down
in
reverent
admiration
the
desire
to
do
honour
to
the
worthiest
of
our
race
is
a
impulse
and
should
be
encouraged
not
checked
our
people
feel
this
we
do
not
bargain
with
them
as
to
what
share
they
shall
have
we
do
not
lay
aside
a
tenth
or
some
such
absurd
proportion
we
say
take
our
wealth
take
whatever
we
can
give
it
is
all
yours
you
are
the
fathers
of
the
state
you
are
our
saviours
and
you
think
this
spirit
prevails
throughout
meccania
i
said
i
am
perfectly
sure
of
it
replied
slimey
all
our
greatest
artists
offer
their
works
freely
to
the
members
of
the
second
class
all
the
most
gifted
scientists
compete
for
places
in
the
colleges
for
the
training
of
the
military
the
services
of
our
best
writers
are
at
their
disposal
we
withhold
nothing
from
them
then
it
is
true
i
gather
that
the
custom
i
have
heard
of
by
which
wives
and
daughters
of
other
classes
if
they
are
thought
worthy
by
the
eugenics
board
are
shall
i
say
dedicated
to
the
service
of
the
second
class
arouses
no
feeling
of
indignation
indignation
exclaimed
the
professor
of
theology
it
is
a
duty
and
a
privilege
but
is
it
not
contrary
to
the
principles
of
the
christian
religion
i
confess
i
speak
with
some
hesitation
as
i
do
not
belong
to
the
christian
communion
but
i
have
been
told
by
some
of
the
strictest
of
the
christian
sects
in
other
countries
that
such
a
practice
is
a
violation
of
the
christian
code
professor
slimey
refreshed
himself
and
i
could
see
another
long
speech
was
coming
that
is
a
sample
of
the
uncharitable
criticism
which
is
constantly
being
aimed
at
us
by
those
who
cloak
their
envy
and
spite
under
the
name
of
christian
doctrine
yet
they
are
utterly
inconsistent
with
themselves
they
admit
the
doctrine
of
development
yet
they
deny
its
application
except
to
suit
their
own
purposes
take
usury
for
example
christian
doctrine
as
expounded
by
the
fathers
regarded
usury
as
sinful
yet
usury
is
practised
in
all
christian
countries
without
protest
why
because
their
system
of
economics
can
not
work
without
it
i
might
give
other
illustrations
but
that
will
suffice
now
ethics
must
undergo
development
if
there
is
to
be
progress
in
morals
the
supreme
of
the
state
gives
the
key
to
all
progress
in
ethics
if
the
custom
you
refer
to
were
due
to
private
concupiscence
we
and
i
speak
for
all
meccanian
theologians
would
be
the
first
to
denounce
it
the
sin
of
adultery
is
a
spiritual
sin
and
exists
only
where
carnal
desire
is
the
motive
every
theologian
knows
that
the
same
physical
act
may
be
performed
in
conformity
with
the
behests
of
the
mosaic
law
or
in
direct
disobedience
of
it
the
one
is
a
sacred
duty
the
other
is
sin
it
is
like
the
alleged
obligation
to
speak
the
truth
upon
all
occasions
there
is
no
such
obligation
we
must
look
to
the
end
in
view
where
the
supreme
needs
of
the
state
demand
concealment
or
even
deception
the
private
ethical
impulse
to
speak
the
truth
to
an
enemy
is
superseded
by
the
greater
obligation
to
the
state
the
virtue
of
chastity
is
not
violated
it
is
raised
if
i
may
say
so
to
its
transcendent
degree
by
an
act
of
sacrifice
which
implies
the
surrender
of
merely
private
virtue
to
the
interests
of
the
state
for
you
must
remember
that
the
state
as
developed
by
the
meccanian
spirit
is
the
highest
embodiment
of
the
will
of
god
upon
earth
we
seem
to
have
been
carried
rather
a
long
way
from
meccanian
economics
i
remarked
turning
to
professor
sauer
by
way
of
apology
for
having
carried
on
the
conversation
for
so
long
with
professor
slimey
not
at
all
he
answered
meccanian
ethics
and
meccanian
economics
can
not
be
separated
it
must
make
the
science
of
economics
much
more
difficult
in
one
sense
but
on
the
other
hand
what
a
relief
it
must
be
to
have
got
rid
of
all
those
old
troublesome
theories
of
value
i
observed
we
have
not
got
rid
of
theories
of
value
answered
sauer
they
too
have
only
been
developed
the
basis
of
our
theory
of
value
is
to
be
found
in
meccanian
ethics
in
other
words
i
said
laughing
the
value
of
a
pair
of
boots
in
meccania
is
determined
by
the
theologians
how
do
you
mean
asked
sauer
i
mean
that
the
remuneration
of
an
artisan
in
the
fifth
class
will
purchase
so
many
pairs
of
boots
and
the
remuneration
of
the
artisan
is
determined
by
what
the
state
thinks
good
for
him
and
what
the
state
thinks
good
for
him
is
determined
by
meccanian
ethics
and
i
suppose
the
theologians
determine
the
system
of
meccanian
ethics
at
that
point
our
conversation
was
interrupted
by
an
announcement
that
the
toast
of
the
evening
would
be
drunk
this
was
the
signal
for
the
party
to
break
up
we
drank
to
the
success
of
the
meccanian
empire
and
the
confounding
of
all
its
enemies
and
i
went
home
to
the
hotel
to
find
a
message
from
kwang
asking
me
to
see
him
the
following
day
i
spent
the
morning
as
usual
with
lickrod
who
was
initiating
me
into
the
method
of
using
the
catalogues
in
the
great
library
of
mecco
it
was
indeed
a
marvel
of
there
was
a
bibliography
upon
every
conceivable
subject
there
was
a
complete
catalogue
of
every
book
according
to
author
and
another
according
to
subject
there
was
a
complete
catalogue
of
the
books
issued
in
each
separate
year
for
the
last
years
there
were
courses
of
study
with
brief
notes
upon
all
the
books
lickrod
was
in
his
element
as
we
came
away
about
i
said
to
him
suppose
i
want
to
take
back
with
me
when
i
leave
the
country
a
dozen
books
to
read
for
pure
pleasure
what
would
you
recommend
me
to
take
upon
what
subject
he
asked
upon
anything
no
matter
what
what
i
am
thinking
of
are
books
which
are
just
works
of
art
in
themselves
pieces
of
pure
literature
either
in
poetry
or
prose
a
book
must
be
about
something
he
said
it
must
fall
into
some
category
or
other
is
there
no
imaginative
literature
i
asked
oh
certainly
we
have
scores
of
treatises
on
the
imagination
but
i
mean
books
that
are
the
work
of
the
imagination
i
see
you
want
them
for
your
children
perhaps
they
would
be
found
in
the
juvenile
departments
fables
and
parables
and
that
sort
of
thing
no
i
mean
books
without
any
serious
purpose
but
for
people
i
seem
to
remember
such
works
in
the
old
meccanian
literature
how
very
odd
answered
lickrod
that
you
should
express
a
wish
to
see
works
of
that
kind
why
i
asked
in
some
surprise
because
we
find
works
of
that
kind
in
great
demand
in
the
asylums
for
the
mentally
afflicted
you
see
we
treat
the
inmates
as
humanely
as
possible
and
our
pathologists
tell
us
that
they
can
not
read
the
books
by
modern
authors
we
have
to
let
them
read
for
a
few
hours
a
day
and
they
beg
really
rather
piteously
for
the
old
books
it
is
always
old
books
they
ask
for
i
suppose
in
a
way
they
are
cases
of
a
kind
of
arrested
development
at
any
rate
they
have
not
been
able
to
keep
pace
with
the
developments
of
our
ideas
doctor
barm
reported
only
last
year
that
the
only
books
that
seem
to
have
a
soothing
effect
on
these
patients
are
those
written
oh
two
hundred
years
ago
and
of
the
very
kind
you
probably
have
in
mind
chapter
xii
the
latest
institution
i
went
to
see
kwang
in
the
afternoon
and
found
him
in
a
state
of
suppressed
excitement
at
least
i
could
not
help
having
that
impression
after
a
little
time
when
i
had
given
him
some
brief
account
of
my
experience
at
the
he
said
i
told
you
the
other
day
that
i
had
some
thoughts
of
returning
home
i
shall
be
off
in
a
fortnight
this
is
rather
sudden
i
said
have
you
received
bad
news
from
home
no
he
said
i
told
you
i
had
practically
completed
my
work
the
fact
is
that
things
are
beginning
to
develop
rather
fast
here
i
see
signs
of
preparation
for
a
move
oh
i
said
not
another
war
not
necessarily
he
replied
light
your
cigar
and
i
will
tell
you
all
you
need
know
i
did
so
and
waited
the
next
war
he
said
will
be
a
chemical
war
a
chemical
war
what
on
earth
is
that
i
said
they
have
been
experimenting
for
thirty
years
and
more
and
they
think
they
have
discovered
what
they
want
it
may
take
them
several
years
to
perfect
their
arrangements
it
will
certainly
take
them
a
year
or
two
and
may
take
six
or
seven
but
one
never
knows
i
suppose
you
never
heard
of
the
three
days
war
did
you
no
i
replied
what
was
it
the
state
of
lugrabia
with
which
the
meccanians
are
in
permanent
alliance
refused
to
ratify
a
new
treaty
that
seemed
unfavourable
to
them
in
some
respects
and
feeling
ran
so
high
that
there
was
some
talk
in
lugrabia
of
putting
an
end
to
the
alliance
without
any
declaration
of
war
the
meccanian
government
dispatched
a
small
fleet
of
planted
about
a
dozen
chemical
as
they
are
euphemistically
called
and
warned
the
lugrabian
state
that
unless
their
terms
were
complied
with
the
twelve
chief
cities
would
be
wiped
out
the
war
was
over
in
three
days
and
to
this
day
the
outside
world
has
never
heard
of
the
event
how
can
it
have
been
kept
secret
i
said
ask
rather
how
could
it
leak
out
replied
kwang
anyhow
he
went
on
they
think
they
have
got
something
that
will
enable
them
to
defeat
any
combination
there
is
no
question
in
dispute
with
any
foreign
power
the
political
is
perfectly
clear
but
it
is
time
for
me
to
go
home
do
you
think
this
idea
of
theirs
is
really
dangerous
i
asked
undoubtedly
but
can
it
not
be
counteracted
in
any
way
if
it
ca
it
will
be
a
bad
look
out
for
the
rest
of
us
he
said
but
do
you
see
any
means
of
meeting
it
there
is
if
i
can
get
the
governments
to
act
but
they
are
at
a
tremendous
disadvantage
why
i
said
because
everything
they
do
will
be
proclaimed
from
the
housetops
however
what
i
wanted
to
do
immediately
was
to
arrange
with
you
about
leaving
the
country
of
course
you
will
stay
as
long
as
you
like
but
i
should
advise
you
not
to
stay
too
long
i
shall
not
announce
that
i
am
going
away
permanently
and
i
shall
leave
nearly
all
my
things
here
to
avoid
suspicion
but
within
three
months
they
will
know
that
i
am
not
likely
to
come
back
and
then
they
may
want
to
look
up
if
you
are
still
here
i
shall
go
as
soon
as
you
think
it
is
advisable
for
me
to
go
i
said
the
only
thing
i
wanted
to
make
sure
of
was
the
thing
you
have
apparently
found
out
once
or
twice
since
i
came
i
have
felt
sceptical
about
the
machiavellian
designs
attributed
to
the
meccanian
government
by
all
these
neighbours
naturally
they
see
a
robber
in
every
bush
i
have
sometimes
been
inclined
to
think
the
meccanians
like
organising
just
for
the
love
of
it
but
you
are
satisfied
that
there
is
more
in
it
than
that
my
dear
child
said
kwang
there
are
some
people
who
ca
see
a
stone
wall
till
they
knock
their
heads
against
it
and
who
ca
tell
that
a
mad
bull
is
dangerous
till
he
tosses
them
in
the
air
and
from
what
i
learn
you
are
almost
as
bad
he
said
laughing
you
have
been
here
how
long
four
or
five
months
at
any
rate
well
you
have
a
very
unsuspicious
mind
but
i
am
going
to
give
you
an
interesting
experience
i
am
going
to
take
you
to
see
a
friend
of
mine
who
has
been
a
prisoner
in
an
asylum
for
the
mentally
afflicted
for
the
last
fifteen
years
i
enjoy
the
privilege
of
talking
to
him
alone
and
i
have
permission
to
take
you
i
wo
stop
to
explain
how
i
obtained
the
privilege
but
it
has
been
very
useful
in
another
quarter
of
an
hour
we
were
rolling
along
in
to
a
place
about
forty
miles
outside
mecco
the
roads
were
as
smooth
as
glass
and
the
car
made
no
noise
so
we
could
converse
without
raising
our
voices
kwang
observed
that
if
i
wished
to
stay
in
meccania
there
was
only
one
way
of
getting
behind
the
screen
and
that
was
to
become
a
convert
the
rôle
of
a
convert
however
was
becoming
more
difficult
to
play
he
had
lately
begun
to
suspect
that
he
was
being
watched
or
at
any
rate
that
one
or
two
people
at
the
foreign
office
were
jealous
of
his
privileges
some
years
ago
the
head
of
the
foreign
office
had
given
him
practically
the
free
run
of
the
country
and
had
utilised
him
as
a
sort
of
missionary
of
meccania
his
books
on
the
of
meccanian
and
on
world
had
been
given
the
widest
possible
publicity
both
in
meccania
and
abroad
he
still
enjoyed
all
his
privileges
for
count
krafft
was
a
powerful
friend
at
the
foreign
office
consequently
the
police
department
had
orders
not
to
interfere
with
him
and
he
had
free
passes
for
almost
everything
but
another
had
lately
begun
to
question
the
wisdom
of
his
colleague
not
openly
but
secretly
and
was
trying
to
get
hold
of
evidence
they
lie
so
wonderfully
and
so
systematically
themselves
said
kwang
that
they
naturally
suspect
everybody
else
of
lying
too
but
this
suspicion
very
often
defeats
its
own
object
still
they
expect
to
have
a
monopoly
of
lying
i
have
seen
official
pamphlets
for
circulation
in
the
departments
on
the
methods
of
testing
the
of
foreigners
and
elaborate
rules
for
finding
out
whether
foreign
governments
are
trying
to
deceive
them
and
you
have
satisfied
all
their
tests
i
said
absolutely
replied
kwang
with
a
smile
but
i
am
not
yet
out
of
the
country
and
i
do
propose
to
risk
it
much
longer
or
i
may
not
be
able
to
get
out
however
he
added
there
is
not
the
slightest
risk
in
taking
you
to
visit
the
asylum
for
i
have
made
a
special
study
of
these
asylums
of
which
there
are
only
about
half
a
dozen
in
the
whole
country
i
got
permission
some
years
ago
i
had
been
discussing
with
count
krafft
the
difficulty
of
dealing
with
a
certain
class
of
persons
to
be
found
in
every
modern
state
who
act
as
a
focus
for
all
opposition
they
cling
obstinately
to
certain
ethical
and
political
doctrines
quite
out
of
harmony
with
those
of
the
and
profess
to
regard
bureaucracy
and
militarism
as
inconsistent
with
liberty
he
told
me
a
good
deal
about
the
methods
employed
and
suggested
that
i
should
visit
one
of
these
asylums
i
did
so
and
asked
permission
to
make
a
study
of
a
few
individual
cases
eventually
i
wrote
a
monograph
on
the
case
of
the
very
man
we
are
going
to
see
and
although
it
was
never
published
count
krafft
was
much
pleased
with
it
the
man
we
shall
see
stillman
represents
a
type
that
has
almost
entirely
disappeared
from
meccania
he
has
had
a
remarkable
history
at
one
time
for
two
or
three
years
he
was
the
chief
political
opponent
of
the
great
prince
mechow
he
belongs
to
an
older
generation
altogether
a
generation
older
than
his
contemporaries
if
you
understand
what
i
mean
nearly
all
his
contemporaries
are
meccanians
but
there
are
still
the
remnants
of
the
opposition
left
when
stillman
was
a
boy
there
were
left
alive
only
a
handful
of
men
who
had
stood
up
to
prince
bludiron
most
of
these
former
opponents
had
emigrated
some
to
transatlantica
some
to
luniland
and
elsewhere
the
rest
ultimately
died
out
stillman
attempted
to
create
a
new
opposition
but
it
was
a
hopeless
task
if
you
want
to
understand
the
political
history
of
meccania
you
can
not
do
better
than
get
him
to
talk
to
you
if
he
is
in
the
mood
we
approached
the
asylum
which
stood
upon
a
lonely
moorland
far
away
from
any
village
the
gates
were
guarded
by
a
single
sentinel
as
we
walked
along
the
path
after
leaving
our
car
in
a
yard
near
the
lodge
we
passed
little
groups
of
men
working
upon
patches
of
garden
they
looked
up
eagerly
as
we
passed
and
then
turned
back
to
their
tasks
i
noticed
they
were
dressed
in
ordinary
black
clothes
it
struck
me
at
once
because
i
had
become
so
used
to
seeing
everybody
in
the
familiar
colours
of
one
of
the
classes
on
my
mentioning
this
to
kwang
he
said
that
is
perfectly
in
accordance
with
the
meccanian
system
these
men
now
belong
to
no
class
they
are
shut
off
from
the
rest
of
the
world
and
their
only
chance
of
returning
to
it
is
for
them
to
renounce
formally
and
absolutely
all
the
errors
of
which
they
have
been
guilty
and
do
many
of
them
i
asked
very
few
most
of
them
do
not
want
to
return
to
the
ordinary
life
of
meccania
but
occasionally
the
desire
to
be
with
some
member
of
their
family
proves
too
strong
for
them
they
are
nearly
all
old
people
here
now
none
of
the
younger
generation
are
attacked
by
the
disease
and
the
authorities
hope
he
smiled
sardonically
that
in
a
few
years
the
disease
will
have
disappeared
entirely
we
first
went
to
call
upon
canting
he
was
in
his
office
which
was
comfortably
furnished
in
very
characteristic
meccanian
taste
the
chairs
were
all
adjustable
and
covered
with
tapestry
the
large
table
had
huge
legs
like
swollen
pillars
they
were
really
made
of
thin
there
were
the
usual
large
portraits
of
the
emperor
and
empress
and
busts
of
prince
mechow
and
prince
bludiron
there
was
the
usual
large
bookcase
full
of
volumes
of
reports
bound
in
and
stamped
with
the
arms
of
meccania
governor
canting
wore
the
green
uniform
of
the
fourth
class
with
various
silver
facings
and
buttons
and
a
collar
of
the
special
kind
worn
by
all
the
clergy
of
the
meccanian
church
he
was
writing
at
his
table
when
we
were
shown
in
he
greeted
kwang
almost
effusively
and
bowed
to
me
with
the
usual
meccanian
attitudes
as
i
was
introduced
so
you
have
brought
your
friend
to
see
our
system
of
treatment
he
said
smiling
it
is
very
unusual
for
us
to
receive
visits
at
all
here
he
turned
to
me
but
kwang
is
quite
a
privileged
person
in
meccania
if
only
there
were
more
people
like
kwang
we
should
not
be
so
much
misunderstood
and
the
victims
of
so
much
envy
malice
and
uncharitableness
still
it
is
a
sad
experience
for
you
do
many
of
the
patients
suffer
acutely
i
asked
hardly
knowing
what
was
the
right
cue
oh
i
did
not
mean
that
no
no
do
suffer
much
but
it
is
sad
to
think
that
men
who
might
have
been
worthy
citizens
some
of
them
as
writers
some
as
teachers
some
even
as
doctors
men
who
might
have
served
the
state
in
a
hundred
ways
are
wasting
their
talents
and
hindering
the
spread
of
our
culture
it
must
be
a
terrible
affliction
i
said
do
they
not
sometimes
feel
it
themselves
in
their
moments
of
clearness
of
mind
he
looked
at
me
a
little
in
doubt
as
to
my
meaning
but
my
face
must
have
reassured
him
the
strange
thing
about
this
disease
he
said
is
that
the
patients
suffer
no
pain
directly
from
it
and
you
must
remember
that
in
practically
all
cases
just
as
in
alcoholism
it
is
there
may
be
some
little
hereditary
tendency
but
the
disease
itself
is
certainly
not
inherited
and
can
be
counteracted
in
its
early
stages
by
prophylactic
treatment
as
we
have
now
fully
demonstrated
as
i
say
it
is
and
it
is
therefore
very
difficult
even
for
a
christian
minister
who
realises
his
duties
to
the
state
as
well
as
to
the
church
always
to
feel
charitably
towards
these
patients
we
can
not
shut
our
eyes
to
the
fact
of
moral
responsibility
and
when
i
think
of
the
obstinacy
of
these
men
i
am
tempted
to
lose
patience
and
their
conceit
to
presume
that
they
a
few
hundreds
of
them
at
most
know
better
than
all
the
wise
and
loyal
statesmen
of
meccania
better
than
all
the
experts
better
than
all
the
millions
of
loyal
citizens
but
it
is
when
i
see
what
a
poor
miserable
handful
of
men
they
are
after
all
that
i
can
find
in
my
heart
to
pity
them
and
how
is
my
special
case
asked
kwang
when
he
could
get
a
word
in
just
the
same
said
canting
just
the
same
you
will
find
him
perhaps
a
little
weaker
i
will
not
go
with
you
you
seem
to
succeed
best
with
him
by
yourself
and
no
doubt
you
have
instructed
your
friend
as
to
the
peculiar
nature
of
his
malady
yes
said
kwang
my
friend
has
read
my
little
monograph
and
he
thought
the
case
so
remarkable
that
with
the
consent
and
approval
of
narrowman
i
brought
him
to
see
patient
stillman
in
the
flesh
i
shall
get
him
to
talk
a
little
good
replied
canting
but
you
will
never
cure
him
you
were
quite
right
in
what
you
once
said
prevention
is
the
only
cure
if
we
had
developed
our
prophylactic
system
earlier
it
might
have
saved
him
but
he
is
too
old
now
after
some
preliminary
formalities
we
were
taken
by
one
of
the
warders
who
was
evidently
acquainted
with
kwang
through
his
many
previous
visits
to
a
room
at
the
end
of
a
long
corridor
where
we
found
stillman
who
greeted
us
cordially
but
with
dignity
his
manner
struck
me
as
being
very
different
from
that
of
the
modern
meccanians
clearly
he
belonged
to
another
generation
the
room
which
was
about
twenty
feet
by
ten
was
a
furnished
with
one
of
those
contrivances
which
becomes
a
bed
by
night
and
a
false
cupboard
by
day
there
was
an
easy
chair
with
the
usual
mechanical
adjustments
a
table
two
bedroom
chairs
a
small
sideboard
and
cupboard
a
few
other
articles
of
necessity
and
a
shelf
of
books
there
were
no
bolts
or
bars
or
chains
the
room
suggested
a
hospital
rather
than
a
prison
stillman
was
a
fine
old
man
and
although
growing
feeble
in
body
was
still
vigorous
in
mind
when
seated
he
held
his
head
erect
and
looked
us
frankly
in
the
face
but
with
a
wistful
expression
he
had
evidently
been
a
man
but
his
face
bore
traces
of
long
suffering
except
that
he
did
not
pace
about
his
cell
he
reminded
me
of
a
caged
lion
one
of
the
orderlies
brought
in
a
tray
of
tea
for
the
three
of
us
stillman
said
what
a
pleasure
it
was
to
see
a
human
being
now
and
then
and
turning
to
me
explained
that
except
to
kwang
and
the
officials
and
the
doctors
he
had
not
spoken
to
anyone
for
five
years
until
five
years
ago
he
said
i
was
able
to
do
a
little
work
in
the
gardens
and
could
converse
with
my
patients
i
mean
but
only
about
our
work
and
in
the
presence
of
a
warder
still
that
was
some
relief
indeed
it
was
a
great
relief
for
every
one
of
the
patients
is
a
kind
of
brother
otherwise
he
would
not
be
here
there
are
only
a
few
hundreds
of
us
left
perhaps
a
couple
of
thousands
altogether
i
do
know
we
have
about
two
hundred
here
and
this
is
one
of
the
largest
hospitals
or
prisons
in
the
country
so
at
least
i
was
told
but
why
is
conversation
not
permitted
i
said
to
be
deprived
of
conversation
must
surely
aggravate
any
tendency
to
mental
instability
the
theory
is
that
communication
with
our
would
hinder
our
recovery
he
replied
with
a
significant
smile
but
what
are
you
supposed
to
be
suffering
from
i
said
a
mental
disease
known
only
to
the
government
of
meccania
he
answered
you
must
have
heard
of
it
kwang
knows
all
about
it
the
real
name
for
it
is
but
they
call
it
i
suffer
very
badly
from
it
and
am
incurable
at
least
i
hope
so
he
added
bitterly
at
this
point
kwang
announced
that
he
wished
to
visit
another
patient
and
that
he
would
leave
us
together
so
that
i
might
have
a
long
talk
undisturbed
it
was
evident
that
he
occupied
a
privileged
position
or
he
would
never
have
been
able
to
have
such
access
to
these
patients
when
he
had
left
the
room
i
did
my
best
to
get
stillman
to
talk
but
i
hardly
knew
how
to
induce
him
to
tell
me
his
story
i
said
i
suppose
you
are
not
treated
badly
apart
from
this
prohibition
about
conversing
with
your
we
are
fed
with
the
exact
amount
of
food
we
require
he
replied
we
are
clothed
and
thank
god
we
do
not
wear
any
of
the
seven
uniforms
and
we
are
decently
warm
except
sometimes
in
winter
when
i
suppose
something
goes
wrong
with
the
apparatus
what
i
said
can
any
apparatus
go
wrong
in
meccania
well
he
said
perhaps
the
fact
is
that
i
want
to
be
warmer
than
the
experts
think
is
necessary
yes
that
is
probably
the
explanation
and
for
the
rest
i
said
have
you
no
occupation
how
do
you
spend
the
time
in
trying
to
preserve
the
last
remains
of
my
sanity
he
answered
and
by
what
means
i
asked
gently
chiefly
by
prayer
and
meditation
he
replied
after
a
short
pause
he
used
the
expressions
which
i
had
not
heard
from
the
lips
of
any
meccanian
before
but
it
is
difficult
he
went
on
to
keep
one
faith
cut
off
from
one
but
they
allow
you
to
attend
religious
services
surely
i
said
the
meccanian
state
church
keeps
a
chaplain
here
and
holds
a
service
every
day
which
is
attended
by
all
the
officials
and
a
few
of
the
patients
but
you
have
heard
the
maxim
regio
ejus
have
you
not
i
nodded
it
has
acquired
a
new
significance
during
the
last
fifty
years
i
have
not
attended
any
of
the
services
since
they
ceased
to
be
compulsory
about
ten
years
ago
that
sounds
very
remarkable
i
said
what
does
it
is
the
first
time
i
have
heard
of
anything
to
be
compulsory
in
meccania
i
said
the
fact
was
that
they
discovered
it
had
a
very
bad
effect
upon
the
disease
my
chief
relief
now
is
reading
which
is
permitted
for
three
hours
a
day
and
you
are
allowed
to
choose
your
own
books
as
a
concession
to
our
mental
infirmity
he
said
we
have
been
granted
the
privilege
of
reading
some
of
the
old
authors
it
came
about
in
this
way
weakling
who
is
in
charge
of
this
hospital
is
the
son
of
one
of
my
oldest
friends
a
man
who
spent
several
years
in
this
place
as
a
patient
he
came
in
about
the
same
time
as
i
did
but
his
health
gave
way
and
he
or
as
they
say
he
but
while
he
was
here
he
begged
to
have
a
few
of
the
old
books
to
save
him
from
going
mad
the
authorities
refused
to
let
him
have
any
books
except
those
specially
provided
and
i
believe
it
was
this
that
made
him
give
way
anyhow
he
used
his
influence
with
his
son
afterwards
for
his
son
had
become
one
of
the
leading
medical
specialists
to
obtain
for
the
older
patients
at
any
rate
a
number
of
the
books
of
the
old
literature
which
nobody
else
wanted
to
read
he
only
got
the
concession
through
on
the
ground
that
it
was
a
psychological
experiment
he
has
had
to
write
a
report
on
the
experiment
every
year
since
its
introduction
that
is
our
greatest
positive
privilege
but
we
have
a
few
negative
privileges
what
do
you
mean
exactly
i
said
we
have
no
compulsory
attendances
we
have
no
forms
to
fill
up
we
are
not
required
to
keep
a
diary
we
are
not
required
to
read
the
gazette
of
nor
play
any
part
in
state
ceremonies
indeed
if
i
could
talk
to
my
friends
who
are
here
i
should
have
little
to
complain
of
on
the
score
of
personal
comfort
then
why
do
you
speak
of
the
difficulty
of
preserving
your
sanity
i
said
rather
thoughtlessly
i
am
afraid
why
do
you
think
i
am
here
at
all
he
replied
for
the
first
time
speaking
fiercely
i
could
have
my
liberty
if
i
chose
could
i
not
then
he
went
on
not
angrily
but
more
bitterly
did
i
say
i
could
have
my
liberty
no
that
is
not
true
i
could
go
out
of
here
tomorrow
but
i
should
not
be
at
liberty
i
stay
here
because
here
i
am
only
a
prisoner
outside
i
should
be
a
slave
how
long
have
you
been
in
meccania
did
you
say
about
five
months
i
said
and
you
are
free
to
go
back
to
your
own
country
certainly
i
said
at
least
i
hope
so
then
go
as
soon
as
you
can
this
is
no
fit
place
for
human
beings
it
is
a
community
of
slaves
who
do
not
even
know
they
are
slaves
because
they
have
never
tasted
liberty
ruled
over
by
a
caste
of
who
have
turned
crime
into
a
science
i
have
not
heard
the
ruling
classes
called
criminals
before
i
said
i
am
not
sure
that
i
understand
what
you
mean
then
you
must
have
been
woefully
taken
in
by
all
this
of
law
and
constitution
and
patriotism
the
whole
place
is
one
gigantic
prison
and
either
the
people
themselves
are
criminals
or
those
who
put
them
there
must
be
there
is
such
a
thing
as
legalised
crime
crime
is
not
merely
the
breaking
of
a
statute
murder
and
rape
are
crimes
statute
or
no
statute
but
what
are
the
crimes
these
rulers
of
meccania
have
committed
i
said
in
all
civilised
countries
he
replied
passionately
if
you
steal
from
a
man
if
you
violate
his
wife
or
his
daughters
if
you
kidnap
his
children
you
are
a
criminal
and
outlawed
from
all
decent
society
these
rulers
of
ours
have
done
worse
than
that
they
have
robbed
us
of
everything
we
have
nothing
of
our
own
they
feed
us
clothe
us
house
us
oh
no
there
is
no
poverty
every
beast
of
burden
in
the
country
is
provided
with
stall
and
fodder
ay
and
harness
too
they
measure
us
weigh
us
doctor
us
instruct
us
drill
us
breed
from
us
experiment
on
us
protect
us
pension
us
and
bury
us
nay
that
is
not
the
end
they
dissect
us
and
analyse
us
and
use
our
carcasses
for
the
benefit
of
science
and
the
i
called
them
a
nation
they
are
not
a
nation
they
are
an
you
have
been
here
five
months
you
say
you
have
seen
a
lot
of
spectacles
no
doubt
you
have
seen
buildings
institutions
organisations
systems
machinery
for
this
and
machinery
for
that
but
you
have
not
seen
a
single
human
being
unless
you
have
visited
our
prisons
and
asylums
you
have
not
been
allowed
to
talk
to
anybody
except
persons
you
have
been
instructed
by
officials
you
have
read
books
selected
by
the
and
written
by
the
you
have
seen
plays
selected
by
the
and
heard
music
selected
by
the
and
seen
pictures
selected
by
the
and
no
doubt
heard
sermons
preached
by
the
your
friend
tells
me
other
nations
are
still
free
what
drives
me
to
the
verge
of
madness
is
to
think
that
we
who
once
were
free
are
enslaved
by
bonds
of
our
own
making
can
you
wonder
after
what
you
have
seen
a
whole
nation
consenting
to
be
slaves
if
only
they
may
make
other
nations
slaves
too
that
i
ask
myself
sometimes
whether
this
is
a
real
lunatic
asylum
whether
i
am
here
because
i
have
these
terrible
hallucinations
whether
all
that
i
think
has
happened
this
last
fifty
years
is
just
a
figment
of
my
brain
and
that
really
if
i
could
only
see
it
the
world
is
just
as
it
used
to
be
when
i
was
a
boy
presently
he
became
calmer
and
began
to
tell
me
something
of
his
life
story
until
i
was
about
twelve
he
said
i
lived
with
my
parents
in
one
of
the
parts
of
meccania
my
father
was
a
merchant
who
had
travelled
a
good
deal
he
was
something
of
a
scholar
too
and
took
interest
in
art
and
archæology
and
as
i
who
was
his
youngest
son
gave
signs
of
similar
tastes
he
took
me
abroad
with
him
several
times
this
made
a
break
in
my
schooling
and
although
i
probably
learnt
more
from
these
travels
especially
as
i
had
the
companionship
of
my
father
it
was
not
easy
to
fit
me
into
the
regular
system
again
so
my
father
decided
to
send
me
to
some
relatives
who
had
settled
in
luniland
and
a
few
years
after
when
i
was
ready
to
go
to
the
university
of
bridgeford
he
and
my
mother
came
to
live
for
a
few
years
in
luniland
up
to
that
time
i
had
taken
no
interest
in
politics
but
i
can
distinctly
recall
now
how
my
father
used
to
lament
over
the
way
things
were
tending
he
said
it
was
becoming
almost
impossible
to
remain
a
good
citizen
he
had
always
thought
himself
a
sane
and
sober
person
not
given
to
quarrelling
but
he
found
it
impossible
to
attach
himself
to
any
of
the
political
parties
or
cliques
in
meccania
he
was
not
a
follower
of
spotts
who
he
said
was
a
kind
of
inverted
bludiron
but
he
disliked
still
more
the
politicians
and
statesmen
who
were
preaching
the
meccanian
spirit
as
a
new
gospel
i
think
it
was
his
growing
uneasiness
with
politics
that
caused
him
to
drift
gradually
into
the
position
of
a
voluntary
exile
but
we
were
very
happy
every
year
or
so
i
used
to
go
over
to
meccania
and
in
spite
of
my
cosmopolitan
education
i
retained
a
strong
affection
for
the
land
of
my
birth
i
was
full
of
its
old
traditions
and
not
even
the
peaceful
charms
of
bridgeford
an
island
that
seemed
like
a
vision
of
utopia
could
stifle
my
passion
for
the
pine
forests
of
bergerland
our
old
home
in
meccania
when
i
had
finished
my
course
at
bridgeford
i
had
to
decide
whether
i
would
return
to
serve
my
two
years
in
the
army
it
was
a
great
worry
to
my
mother
that
i
had
not
like
my
brothers
passed
the
meccanian
examination
which
reduced
the
time
of
service
to
one
year
but
i
made
light
of
the
matter
and
although
after
my
life
in
luniland
it
was
very
distasteful
to
me
i
went
through
my
two
years
as
cheerfully
as
i
could
i
learnt
a
great
deal
from
it
i
was
nicknamed
lunilander
and
was
unpopular
because
i
did
not
share
the
silly
enthusiasm
and
boasting
which
at
that
time
was
prevalent
i
had
got
out
of
touch
with
the
youthful
life
of
meccania
and
these
two
years
opened
my
eyes
but
i
will
not
dwell
on
that
time
at
the
end
of
it
i
joined
my
father
who
had
remained
in
luniland
when
he
was
not
travelling
it
was
time
to
choose
a
career
i
had
little
taste
for
business
and
i
was
determined
that
i
would
not
become
an
official
of
any
kind
and
when
i
proposed
to
devote
some
years
to
following
up
the
work
that
my
father
had
planned
for
himself
but
had
never
been
able
to
carry
out
he
gave
his
consent
we
had
just
planned
a
long
archæological
tour
in
francaria
when
the
great
war
broke
out
i
shall
never
forget
the
state
of
agitation
into
which
this
catastrophe
threw
him
i
was
about
to
return
to
meccania
in
obedience
to
the
instruction
i
had
received
when
he
begged
me
not
to
go
back
at
any
cost
he
had
spent
two
sleepless
nights
and
his
agony
of
mind
was
terrible
what
he
had
feared
for
years
had
come
to
pass
he
had
thought
it
would
be
somehow
avoided
he
had
been
watching
events
very
closely
for
the
few
weeks
before
the
crisis
the
day
that
war
was
declared
between
luniland
and
meccania
he
declared
his
intention
of
going
back
to
meccania
but
not
to
join
in
the
madness
of
his
country
he
could
not
do
much
probably
he
would
not
be
allowed
to
do
anything
but
at
any
rate
he
would
fight
for
sanity
and
right
my
mother
was
eager
to
go
back
but
for
other
reasons
she
burst
out
into
a
frenzy
of
abuse
of
luniland
she
repeated
all
the
lies
that
i
had
heard
in
meccania
about
the
country
in
which
she
had
been
perfectly
happy
for
years
she
called
me
a
coward
for
not
being
with
my
brothers
she
said
she
had
always
been
against
my
having
come
to
luniland
i
knew
she
was
hysterical
but
i
could
hardly
believe
my
ears
my
father
stood
firm
he
insisted
on
my
staying
he
said
he
should
regard
himself
as
a
murderer
if
he
consented
to
my
going
to
fight
for
what
he
knew
to
be
a
monstrous
crime
what
my
mother
had
said
although
of
course
it
pained
me
did
more
to
convince
me
that
my
father
was
right
than
anything
he
could
have
said
i
had
seen
already
the
accounts
of
the
meccanian
crowds
shouting
for
war
in
a
frenzy
of
martial
pride
i
had
seen
also
the
streets
of
lunopolis
full
of
serious
faces
awed
by
the
thought
of
war
and
yet
never
wavering
a
moment
i
had
heard
my
own
countrymen
jeering
at
the
craven
spirit
of
the
lunilanders
it
was
a
cruel
position
to
be
in
and
in
the
years
that
followed
i
was
tempted
sometimes
to
regret
that
i
had
not
gone
back
and
sought
peace
of
mind
in
a
soldier
grave
but
in
my
heart
i
was
so
revolted
by
the
thought
that
all
this
horror
was
the
work
of
my
countrymen
that
i
grew
ashamed
of
being
a
meccanian
for
the
first
two
years
my
father
wrote
to
me
constantly
and
if
i
had
had
any
doubts
of
the
rightness
of
my
conduct
what
he
said
would
have
sustained
me
but
that
is
a
long
story
all
i
need
say
is
that
it
was
in
those
years
of
suffering
and
horror
that
i
discovered
where
my
duty
lay
and
took
a
vow
to
follow
it
when
the
war
ended
i
would
go
back
and
if
i
were
the
only
man
left
in
meccania
i
would
fight
for
truth
and
liberty
it
was
a
quixotic
vow
but
i
was
a
young
man
of
thirty
well
i
came
back
i
had
to
wait
three
years
even
after
the
war
was
over
until
there
was
an
amnesty
for
such
as
i
and
when
i
did
set
foot
here
again
the
cause
i
had
come
to
fight
for
was
already
lost
but
i
did
not
know
it
my
father
had
already
spent
two
years
in
prison
and
was
only
released
in
time
to
die
but
through
him
i
knew
that
there
were
still
some
left
who
felt
as
we
did
the
idea
of
liberty
had
been
lost
although
the
war
had
been
over
three
years
everybody
was
still
under
martial
law
the
military
professed
that
the
country
was
in
danger
of
a
revolution
the
newspapers
preached
the
necessity
for
everybody
to
be
organised
to
repair
the
ravages
of
the
war
the
socialists
said
the
economic
revolution
so
long
predicted
was
accomplishing
itself
for
a
few
years
we
could
make
no
headway
then
things
began
to
settle
down
a
little
the
fever
seemed
to
be
spending
itself
that
was
the
moment
when
prince
mechow
became
chief
minister
of
the
interior
some
semblance
of
constitutional
government
was
restored
and
we
began
to
hope
for
better
things
we
started
a
newspaper
and
established
societies
in
all
the
big
towns
what
we
were
out
for
was
first
and
foremost
political
liberty
we
had
three
or
four
brilliant
writers
and
speakers
but
the
only
papers
that
would
take
our
articles
were
a
few
of
the
socialist
papers
which
wrote
leaders
criticising
our
ideas
as
and
the
only
people
who
came
to
our
meetings
were
socialists
who
used
them
to
speechify
about
the
economic
revolution
then
mechow
reforms
began
all
education
was
completely
controlled
the
press
was
bought
up
and
gradually
suppressed
the
right
of
public
meeting
was
curtailed
till
it
disappeared
altogether
the
censorship
of
printing
was
made
complete
new
regulations
accumulated
year
by
year
and
month
by
month
the
seven
classes
were
established
and
all
the
time
the
socialists
went
on
prating
about
the
economic
revolution
prince
mechow
was
doing
their
work
they
said
all
they
would
have
to
do
would
be
to
step
into
his
place
when
he
had
completed
it
a
few
hundreds
of
us
scattered
in
various
parts
of
the
country
tried
to
keep
up
the
struggle
we
got
into
prison
several
times
but
nobody
cared
a
straw
for
our
party
as
they
called
it
i
fell
ill
and
then
i
tried
to
go
abroad
for
a
rest
i
was
arrested
for
an
alleged
plot
and
sentenced
to
a
term
of
imprisonment
and
degradation
to
the
fifth
class
after
that
i
was
forbidden
to
communicate
with
my
children
for
fear
of
infecting
them
as
they
grew
up
in
their
teens
even
they
grew
to
look
on
me
as
an
eccentric
need
i
say
more
the
time
came
when
i
had
either
to
recant
from
all
my
convictions
or
be
treated
as
a
person
of
unsound
mind
i
came
here
determined
to
hold
out
to
the
last
what
i
feared
and
i
think
i
feared
nothing
else
was
that
some
of
their
diabolical
medical
experiments
would
undermine
my
will
fortunately
i
was
sent
here
where
after
a
time
weakling
who
is
at
any
rate
not
a
scoundrel
has
done
his
best
to
protect
me
he
represents
a
type
we
have
in
meccania
perhaps
the
most
common
type
of
all
a
man
who
conforms
to
the
system
because
he
finds
himself
in
it
and
part
of
it
but
who
is
not
actively
wicked
and
who
has
some
good
nature
left
he
regards
me
and
those
like
me
as
fanatics
who
are
harmless
so
long
as
we
are
only
few
in
number
so
you
think
your
cause
is
lost
i
said
no
he
said
quickly
our
cause
is
not
lost
it
is
meccania
that
is
lost
but
is
there
no
hope
even
for
meccania
there
is
no
hope
from
within
hope
can
only
come
from
without
that
is
a
hard
saying
how
can
it
come
from
without
fifty
years
ago
our
neighbours
not
our
enemies
our
neighbours
fought
for
liberty
they
set
themselves
free
but
they
did
not
set
us
free
they
said
they
would
make
the
world
safe
for
democracy
well
did
they
not
do
so
i
asked
he
was
quiet
for
a
minute
i
wonder
if
they
did
he
said
i
wonder
if
either
liberty
or
democracy
can
be
safe
so
long
as
there
is
a
if
a
tragedy
like
this
can
happen
to
one
nation
it
can
happen
to
the
whole
world
meccania
will
never
become
free
whilst
the
meccanian
spirit
remains
alive
and
liberty
will
never
be
secure
until
the
whole
world
is
free
he
sank
back
in
his
chair
looking
very
tired
after
the
excitement
of
our
interview
at
this
moment
a
gong
sounded
it
was
the
signal
for
supper
and
he
got
up
mechanically
to
wash
his
hands
in
a
bowl
by
the
side
of
his
kwang
then
knocked
at
the
door
and
came
to
bid
we
left
our
preparing
to
cross
the
quadrangle
it
was
growing
dark
and
we
could
see
the
lights
in
the
great
hall
of
the
hospital
we
were
just
about
to
walk
back
to
the
lodge
when
kwang
suddenly
said
come
with
me
i
followed
him
through
a
long
corridor
and
he
led
the
way
to
a
door
which
opened
into
the
great
there
we
saw
seated
at
long
tables
nearly
two
hundred
old
men
they
had
just
begun
their
evening
meal
there
was
a
strange
silence
oppressive
and
almost
sinister
there
were
no
servants
to
wait
on
them
but
some
of
the
more
active
men
handed
the
dishes
while
a
couple
of
warders
in
green
uniforms
seemed
to
be
patrolling
the
room
for
the
purpose
of
checking
all
attempts
at
conversation
but
there
was
not
even
a
whisper
the
men
did
not
look
sullen
or
rebellious
perhaps
they
had
got
past
that
i
could
see
them
interchanging
looks
of
friendly
greeting
across
the
room
and
no
doubt
from
long
practice
they
had
learnt
to
convey
some
simple
messages
by
a
glance
or
a
smile
but
there
was
an
air
of
quiet
courtesy
about
them
so
different
from
what
i
had
learnt
to
know
as
the
typical
meccanian
manner
i
looked
at
the
faces
of
those
nearest
me
many
of
them
might
have
sat
for
the
portraits
of
senators
or
have
served
as
models
for
some
of
those
paintings
of
assemblies
of
statesmen
and
ambassadors
of
bygone
centuries
the
surroundings
were
not
altogether
wanting
in
dignity
the
hall
was
large
and
lofty
and
although
bare
save
for
the
inevitable
imperial
portraits
which
greet
one
everywhere
was
not
unsightly
indeed
the
absence
of
ornament
was
a
relief
from
the
perpetual
reminders
of
the
latest
phases
of
meccanian
art
governor
canting
had
apparently
been
present
at
the
beginning
of
the
meal
and
was
going
off
to
his
own
dinner
he
joined
us
for
a
moment
do
you
notice
he
said
how
ungracious
their
expression
is
one
would
think
they
had
never
come
under
the
influence
of
the
meccanian
spirit
their
whole
bearing
is
characteristic
of
their
attitude
of
studied
disloyalty
they
never
even
give
the
salute
it
has
not
been
insisted
upon
because
you
know
and
he
tapped
his
forehead
they
would
not
meet
with
such
consideration
in
many
countries
but
we
have
respect
for
age
and
infirmity
no
matter
what
provocation
we
receive
we
left
the
hall
and
took
our
leave
of
hospital
governor
canting
as
we
started
on
our
journey
it
was
dark
and
a
cool
wind
was
blowing
we
could
see
before
us
the
dull
glow
of
light
from
the
great
city
in
the
distance
the
road
was
perfect
and
we
passed
few
vehicles
of
any
kind
but
we
were
stopped
three
times
by
the
police
to
whom
kwang
showed
his
pass
as
we
entered
the
outer
ring
we
slowed
down
although
we
were
passing
along
the
main
roadway
only
a
few
persons
were
to
be
seen
here
and
there
near
the
outer
ring
in
the
business
quarter
we
passed
a
few
groups
of
workmen
marching
in
step
on
their
way
home
the
trams
were
running
but
there
was
no
bustle
and
no
excitement
no
boisterous
groups
of
young
people
filled
the
streets
no
sound
of
laughter
or
fell
on
our
ears
where
were
the
people
where
were
those
crowds
that
make
the
streets
of
all
cities
in
the
world
a
spectacle
to
move
the
heart
of
man
this
might
have
been
a
town
a
city
of
the
dead
we
passed
the
great
station
with
its
lofty
dome
and
the
towering
pile
of
the
time
department
with
the
great
clock
above
it
as
we
slowly
swung
through
the
great
square
the
colossal
statue
of
prince
mechow
looked
down
on
us
like
the
grim
and
menacing
image
of
this
city
of
power
was
he
some
evil
genius
that
had
slain
the
souls
of
men
leaving
their
bodies
only
to
inhabit
the
vast
he
had
built
for
them
with
their
own
labour
kwang
put
me
down
at
the
hotel
and
drove
on
to
his
rooms
i
found
a
letter
awaiting
me
it
was
from
my
father
and
contained
painful
news
my
mother
was
seriously
ill
and
he
urged
me
to
return
at
once
early
next
morning
i
hastened
to
visit
kwang
first
obtaining
permission
from
the
manager
of
the
hotel
and
found
him
busy
with
his
preparations
also
do
be
alarmed
he
said
when
i
told
him
my
news
your
mother
is
not
at
any
rate
we
do
not
know
that
she
is
i
thought
it
was
time
for
you
to
be
getting
ready
to
leave
this
country
and
i
had
that
letter
sent
it
will
be
a
good
reason
in
the
eyes
of
the
i
go
the
day
after
i
have
a
secret
mission
for
the
government
to
the
chinese
embassy
at
prisa
the
capital
of
francaria
i
may
not
return
i
may
fall
suddenly
i
expressed
some
surprise
that
kwang
the
most
privileged
stranger
in
meccania
the
with
all
the
official
world
should
think
it
necessary
to
slip
out
of
the
country
by
a
back
door
and
provide
for
my
sudden
departure
as
well
you
have
been
here
five
months
he
said
i
have
been
here
fifteen
years
it
is
always
best
in
this
country
to
take
as
little
risk
as
possible
consistent
with
your
objectives
a
word
to
the
wise
if
you
have
anything
that
you
wish
to
take
out
with
you
you
had
better
let
me
have
it
you
will
be
examined
when
you
go
out
as
you
were
when
you
came
in
i
do
not
propose
to
be
examined
when
i
leave
that
is
why
i
am
going
via
prisa
on
a
special
mission
chapter
xiii
never
again
i
did
not
see
kwang
again
until
we
met
some
weeks
after
in
prisa
he
had
begun
to
suspect
that
one
or
two
persons
in
the
foreign
department
had
guessed
the
nature
of
the
rôle
he
had
been
playing
there
was
practically
no
evidence
against
him
because
all
the
information
he
had
obtained
and
it
was
a
great
deal
had
been
furnished
to
him
willingly
by
the
meccanian
government
under
the
impression
that
he
had
become
a
sort
of
missionary
of
meccanian
culture
all
the
same
as
he
observed
to
me
without
arresting
him
as
a
spy
a
course
of
procedure
which
for
many
reasons
would
have
been
inconvenient
to
the
government
he
might
have
been
made
the
victim
of
an
he
could
no
longer
play
his
part
in
safety
anyhow
he
succeeded
in
making
his
exit
in
a
manner
that
aroused
no
suspicion
and
he
managed
to
return
to
his
own
country
a
short
time
afterwards
consequently
i
need
say
no
more
about
kwang
my
own
departure
was
also
rather
a
tame
affair
i
had
an
interview
on
the
day
i
received
my
letter
with
inspector
of
foreigners
bulley
although
i
knew
that
the
letter
had
been
censored
and
i
was
morally
certain
its
contents
had
been
made
known
to
him
he
betrayed
no
knowledge
of
the
facts
i
explained
the
circumstances
and
showed
him
the
letter
i
asked
if
the
three
days
notice
could
be
dispensed
with
as
i
wished
to
leave
at
the
earliest
moment
he
said
i
might
possibly
leave
the
day
after
but
not
before
as
it
would
be
necessary
to
see
that
all
my
affairs
were
in
order
before
issuing
the
certificate
of
absolution
as
it
was
called
a
certificate
which
all
foreigners
must
obtain
before
the
issue
of
the
ticket
authorising
them
to
be
conveyed
across
the
frontier
there
would
be
a
charge
of
for
the
extra
trouble
involved
one
little
difficulty
had
not
occurred
to
me
there
might
not
be
a
conveyance
to
graves
via
bridgetown
for
several
days
perhaps
not
for
a
week
inspector
bulley
who
had
all
such
matters
at
his
told
me
there
was
no
conveyance
for
five
days
by
that
route
but
that
he
would
arrange
for
me
to
travel
by
another
route
via
primburg
and
durven
which
lay
convenient
for
a
journey
to
prisa
after
that
i
could
either
return
home
direct
or
go
first
to
lunopolis
he
was
sorry
my
visit
had
been
cut
short
almost
before
my
serious
study
had
begun
and
hoped
i
should
find
it
possible
to
return
he
arranged
for
me
to
undergo
my
necessary
medical
examination
on
the
afternoon
of
the
same
day
and
this
turned
out
to
be
almost
a
formality
pincher
was
much
more
polite
and
much
less
exacting
than
on
a
former
occasion
clearly
the
influence
of
kwang
for
i
was
now
regarded
as
a
sort
of
protégé
of
his
was
evident
in
all
this
altogether
my
exit
was
made
quite
pleasant
and
i
almost
began
to
regret
my
precipitancy
but
when
i
reflected
on
what
i
had
to
gain
by
staying
longer
i
saw
that
kwang
was
right
i
turned
over
in
my
mind
what
i
had
seen
and
learnt
during
five
months
i
had
seen
a
provincial
town
or
some
aspects
of
it
and
the
capital
under
the
close
supervision
of
warders
i
had
talked
to
a
score
of
officials
and
a
few
professors
and
received
a
vast
amount
of
instruction
from
them
i
had
seen
a
great
public
ceremony
i
had
visited
a
large
number
of
institutions
but
i
had
only
got
into
contact
with
a
single
native
meccanian
who
was
free
from
the
influence
of
the
and
this
person
was
in
an
asylum
only
accessible
by
a
dangerous
ruse
i
knew
little
more
of
the
people
perhaps
less
than
i
could
have
got
from
reading
a
few
books
but
i
had
at
any
rate
got
an
impression
of
the
meccanian
which
no
book
could
have
given
me
that
impression
was
the
most
valuable
result
of
my
tour
but
it
seemed
unlikely
that
a
further
stay
would
do
anything
more
than
deepen
it
for
unless
i
were
prepared
to
play
the
rôle
that
kwang
had
played
i
was
not
likely
to
learn
anything
the
meccanian
government
did
not
wish
me
to
learn
and
however
much
i
might
be
sustained
by
my
curiosity
the
actual
experience
of
living
in
the
atmosphere
of
the
meccanian
was
not
pleasant
i
said
to
my
friends
at
the
hotel
and
after
an
uneventful
journey
by
express
train
reached
primburg
except
that
it
bore
a
general
resemblance
to
bridgetown
i
can
say
nothing
of
it
for
we
were
not
permitted
to
go
out
of
the
station
whilst
waiting
for
the
to
take
us
across
the
frontier
i
say
because
there
were
about
half
a
dozen
other
travellers
the
fact
that
not
more
than
half
a
dozen
persons
a
week
travelled
from
mecco
to
prisa
for
this
was
the
main
route
to
the
capital
of
francaria
was
in
itself
astounding
even
of
these
three
looked
like
persons
on
official
business
at
primburg
i
was
spared
the
indignity
of
a
further
medical
examination
as
i
had
already
obtained
the
necessary
certificate
from
pincher
but
nothing
could
exempt
me
from
the
examination
which
all
foreigners
had
to
submit
to
in
order
to
ensure
that
they
carried
nothing
out
of
the
country
except
by
leave
of
the
chief
inspector
of
foreign
observers
my
journal
had
been
entrusted
to
kwang
and
i
had
nothing
else
of
any
importance
i
was
thoroughly
searched
and
my
clothes
and
my
baggage
were
closely
examined
by
an
official
called
the
registrar
of
travellers
although
i
had
spent
a
considerable
time
in
francaria
i
had
never
before
seen
durven
there
was
now
no
reason
for
hurrying
on
to
prisa
so
i
decided
to
spend
a
day
there
to
look
round
i
had
to
report
myself
to
the
police
owing
to
the
fact
that
i
had
arrived
from
meccania
but
my
credentials
proving
perfectly
satisfactory
i
was
at
liberty
to
go
where
i
liked
it
was
about
four
when
i
stepped
out
of
the
police
station
and
as
it
was
a
bright
september
afternoon
there
was
still
time
to
walk
about
for
some
hours
before
dark
at
first
for
about
an
hour
i
could
hardly
help
feeling
that
i
was
dreaming
here
i
was
in
the
old
familiar
life
of
europe
again
the
streets
of
the
town
seemed
full
of
people
some
sauntering
about
and
gossiping
with
their
friends
others
others
carrying
parcels
containing
their
purchases
some
making
their
way
home
from
business
others
standing
in
groups
near
the
theatres
there
were
and
omnibuses
and
all
sorts
of
vehicles
jostling
in
the
central
part
of
the
town
a
little
later
i
saw
people
streaming
out
from
a
popular
there
were
old
men
selling
the
first
issues
of
the
evening
papers
and
crying
some
sensational
news
which
was
not
of
the
slightest
importance
but
which
somehow
seemed
good
fun
i
was
delighted
with
everything
i
saw
it
was
a
positive
joy
not
to
see
any
green
uniforms
nor
any
grey
uniforms
nor
any
yellow
uniforms
green
and
grey
and
yellow
are
beautiful
colours
but
the
plain
black
of
the
civilian
dress
of
the
men
in
the
streets
of
durven
seemed
pleasanter
and
the
costumes
of
the
women
seemed
positively
beautiful
there
were
children
walking
with
their
mothers
and
little
urchins
racing
about
in
the
side
streets
i
could
have
laughed
with
joy
at
the
sight
of
them
i
had
seen
no
children
for
five
months
only
little
there
were
old
women
selling
flowers
i
wondered
if
they
were
poor
they
looked
fat
and
happy
at
any
rate
and
they
were
free
to
sell
flowers
or
do
anything
else
they
liked
i
turned
into
a
café
a
little
band
was
playing
some
rollicking
frivolous
music
that
i
recognised
i
remembered
some
of
my
former
friends
making
sarcastic
remarks
about
this
kind
of
music
it
was
not
good
music
yet
it
made
me
feel
like
laughing
or
dancing
there
was
such
a
babel
of
talk
i
could
hardly
hear
the
band
not
that
i
wanted
to
i
was
quite
content
to
hear
the
happy
voices
round
me
to
watch
the
simple
comedies
of
human
intercourse
and
to
feel
that
i
was
out
of
prison
i
strolled
out
again
this
time
i
looked
at
the
streets
themselves
at
the
buildings
and
houses
and
shops
i
dived
down
a
side
street
or
two
and
found
myself
by
the
river
among
little
wharves
and
docks
all
on
the
tiniest
scale
the
streets
were
rather
untidy
and
not
too
clean
the
houses
were
irregularly
built
i
was
in
the
old
town
apparently
as
i
walked
farther
i
noticed
that
by
far
the
greater
part
of
the
town
had
been
built
during
the
last
fifty
years
or
so
yet
the
place
looked
as
if
it
were
trying
to
preserve
the
appearance
of
age
at
another
time
i
should
probably
have
thought
the
town
rather
dull
and
uninteresting
for
there
was
nothing
noteworthy
about
it
if
there
had
once
been
any
genuine
mediæval
churches
or
guild
halls
or
places
of
architectural
interest
they
must
have
been
destroyed
yet
i
discovered
a
strange
joy
and
delight
in
everything
i
saw
after
dark
when
i
had
dined
at
the
little
hotel
where
i
was
to
sleep
that
night
i
went
off
at
once
to
the
nearest
theatre
which
happened
to
be
a
music
hall
i
laughed
at
the
turns
until
people
looked
at
me
to
see
if
i
were
drunk
or
demented
when
they
saw
i
was
only
a
little
excited
they
made
remarks
they
were
rather
pleased
that
i
should
be
so
easily
amused
perhaps
he
has
just
come
out
of
prison
said
one
no
doubt
it
is
rather
dull
there
perhaps
he
is
a
friend
of
one
of
the
actors
said
another
and
wants
to
encourage
him
perhaps
he
has
come
from
the
land
where
jokes
are
prohibited
said
a
third
perhaps
he
is
a
deaf
man
who
has
recovered
his
hearing
said
another
or
a
blind
man
who
has
recovered
his
sight
anyhow
he
knows
how
to
enjoy
himself
such
were
the
remarks
they
made
when
i
came
out
i
strolled
about
the
streets
until
after
midnight
it
seemed
so
jolly
to
be
able
to
go
just
where
one
pleased
in
the
morning
i
looked
up
the
trains
to
prisa
and
found
that
i
could
reach
it
in
a
few
hours
so
i
decided
to
spend
the
morning
in
durven
and
go
on
to
prisa
in
the
afternoon
i
strolled
into
the
open
how
strange
it
seemed
people
in
all
sorts
of
simple
costumes
were
going
round
to
the
various
stalls
picking
up
one
thing
here
and
another
there
the
usual
little
comedies
of
bargaining
were
going
on
there
were
all
sorts
of
trifles
for
sale
including
toys
for
children
real
toys
not
disguised
mathematical
problems
or
exercises
in
mechanical
ingenuity
there
were
dolls
and
rattles
and
hoops
and
balls
and
whistles
and
and
marbles
and
pegtops
and
houses
and
furniture
and
bricks
and
a
hundred
things
besides
then
there
were
gingerbread
stalls
stalls
shies
swings
and
even
a
little
i
felt
i
should
like
to
ride
on
that
but
as
it
was
early
in
the
forenoon
there
were
only
a
few
children
good
heavens
what
were
children
doing
here
they
ought
to
have
been
at
school
or
at
any
rate
being
instructed
in
the
use
of
stage
ii
b
toys
i
turned
into
the
street
where
the
best
shops
were
even
the
grocers
shops
looked
interesting
there
were
goods
from
all
over
the
world
there
were
cheeses
packed
in
dainty
little
cases
and
dates
in
little
boxes
covered
with
pictures
tea
in
packets
and
canisters
representing
absurd
chinamen
and
hindoo
coolies
the
clothing
shops
were
full
of
the
latest
fashions
although
this
was
a
small
provincial
town
and
very
dainty
and
charming
they
looked
then
there
were
antique
shops
and
shops
print
shops
and
shops
i
could
have
spent
days
wandering
about
like
a
child
at
a
fair
i
had
never
realised
before
that
the
meanest
european
town
outside
meccania
is
a
sort
of
perennial
bazaar
i
tore
myself
away
and
after
luncheon
took
train
to
prisa
the
confusion
and
bustle
at
the
stations
was
delightful
the
chatter
of
the
passengers
was
most
entertaining
there
were
people
in
shabby
clothes
and
people
in
smart
costumes
there
were
and
guards
in
rather
uniforms
and
an
occasional
gendarme
who
looked
as
if
he
had
come
off
the
stage
the
villages
on
the
route
were
like
the
villages
i
had
seen
before
in
europe
fragments
of
bygone
ages
mixed
up
with
the
latest
devices
in
farm
buildings
and
model
cottages
churches
built
in
the
twelfth
century
and
post
offices
built
in
the
twentieth
mediæval
barns
and
modern
factories
at
length
we
reached
prisa
which
needs
no
description
from
me
it
looked
like
an
old
friend
and
i
lost
no
time
in
resuming
the
habits
i
had
adopted
during
my
previous
stay
i
looked
up
some
of
my
old
acquaintances
and
we
spent
days
in
endless
talk
about
everything
under
the
sun
what
a
delight
it
was
to
read
the
newspapers
no
matter
how
silly
they
were
how
delightful
to
hear
the
latest
gossip
about
the
latest
political
crisis
the
latest
dramatic
success
the
latest
social
scandal
the
latest
literary
quarrel
in
a
week
or
two
i
had
almost
forgotten
the
existence
of
meccania
i
had
seen
nothing
to
remind
me
of
it
i
began
to
understand
why
the
people
in
francaria
and
luniland
were
so
ignorant
of
that
country
why
should
they
bother
their
heads
about
it
it
seemed
to
me
now
like
a
bad
dream
a
nightmare
they
were
quite
right
to
ignore
it
to
forget
it
and
yet
suppose
meccania
should
startle
europe
again
and
with
a
chemical
war
this
time
would
they
be
able
to
escape
or
would
the
finally
conquer
the
human
race
i
confess
i
felt
some
doubt
it
seemed
not
impossible
that
the
nightmare
i
had
escaped
from
was
a
doom
impending
over
the
whole
world
and
it
is
because
i
could
not
dismiss
this
doubt
that
i
have
written
a
faithful
account
of
what
i
saw
and
heard
in
meccania
the
transcriber
