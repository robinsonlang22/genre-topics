the
inner
house
prologue
at
the
royal
institution
professor
cried
the
director
rushing
to
meet
their
guest
and
lecturer
as
the
door
was
thrown
open
and
the
great
man
appeared
calm
and
composed
as
if
there
was
nothing
more
in
the
wind
than
an
ordinary
scientific
discourse
you
are
always
welcome
my
friend
always
welcome
the
two
enthusiasts
for
science
wrung
hands
and
never
more
welcome
than
then
the
great
mystery
is
to
be
solved
at
last
the
theatre
is
crammed
with
people
what
does
it
mean
you
must
tell
me
before
you
go
in
the
physicist
smiled
i
came
to
a
conviction
that
i
was
on
the
true
line
five
years
ago
he
said
it
is
only
within
the
last
six
months
that
i
have
demonstrated
the
thing
to
a
certainty
i
will
tell
you
my
friend
he
whispered
before
we
go
in
then
he
advanced
and
shook
hands
with
the
president
whatever
the
importance
of
your
discovery
professor
said
the
president
we
are
fully
sensible
of
the
honor
you
have
done
us
in
bringing
it
before
an
english
audience
first
of
all
and
especially
before
an
audience
of
the
royal
institution
ja
ja
herr
president
but
i
give
my
discovery
to
all
the
world
at
this
same
hour
as
for
myself
i
announce
it
to
my
very
good
friends
of
the
royal
institution
why
not
to
my
other
very
good
friends
of
the
royal
society
because
it
is
a
thing
which
belongs
to
the
whole
world
and
not
to
scientific
men
only
it
was
in
the
library
of
the
royal
institution
the
president
and
council
of
the
institution
were
gathered
together
to
receive
their
illustrious
lecturer
and
every
face
was
touched
with
interrogation
and
anxiety
what
was
this
great
discovery
for
six
months
there
had
appeared
from
time
to
time
mysterious
telegrams
in
the
papers
all
connected
with
this
industrious
professor
laboratory
nothing
definite
nothing
certain
it
was
whispered
that
a
new
discovery
soon
about
to
be
announced
would
entirely
change
the
relations
of
man
to
man
of
nation
to
nation
those
who
professed
to
be
in
the
secret
suggested
that
it
might
alter
all
governments
and
abolish
all
laws
why
they
said
that
i
know
not
because
certainly
nobody
was
admitted
to
the
laboratory
and
the
professor
had
no
confidant
this
man
with
the
enormous
bald
forehead
and
the
big
glasses
on
his
fat
nose
it
was
long
and
broad
as
well
as
fat
kept
his
own
counsel
yet
in
some
way
people
were
perfectly
certain
that
something
wonderful
was
coming
so
when
roger
bacon
made
his
gunpowder
the
monks
might
have
whispered
to
each
other
only
from
the
smell
which
came
through
the
that
now
the
devil
would
at
last
be
met
upon
his
own
ground
the
telegrams
were
continued
with
exasperating
pertinacity
until
over
the
whole
civilized
world
the
eyes
of
all
who
loved
science
were
turned
upon
that
modest
laboratory
in
the
little
university
of
ganzweltweisst
am
rhein
what
was
coming
from
it
one
does
not
go
so
far
as
to
say
that
all
interest
in
contemporary
business
politics
art
and
letters
ceased
but
it
is
quite
certain
that
every
morning
and
every
evening
when
everybody
opened
his
paper
his
first
thought
was
to
look
for
news
from
ganzweltweisst
am
rhein
but
the
days
passed
by
and
no
news
came
this
was
especially
hard
on
the
who
were
one
and
all
waiting
each
man
longing
to
have
a
cut
in
with
the
subject
before
anybody
else
got
it
but
it
was
good
for
the
people
who
write
letters
to
the
papers
because
they
had
so
many
opportunities
of
suggestion
and
surmise
and
so
the
got
something
to
talk
about
after
all
for
some
suggested
that
schwarzbaum
had
found
out
a
way
to
make
food
artificially
by
chemically
compounding
nitrogens
phosphates
and
so
forth
and
these
philosophers
built
a
magnificent
palace
of
imagination
in
which
dwelt
a
glorified
mankind
no
longer
occupied
in
endless
toil
for
the
sake
of
providing
meat
and
drink
for
themselves
and
their
families
but
all
engaged
in
the
pursuit
of
knowledge
and
in
art
of
all
kinds
such
as
fiction
poetry
painting
music
acting
and
so
forth
getting
out
of
life
such
a
wealth
of
emotion
pleasure
and
culture
as
the
world
had
never
before
imagined
others
there
were
who
thought
that
the
great
discovery
might
be
a
method
of
instantaneous
transmission
of
matter
from
place
to
place
so
that
as
by
the
electric
wire
one
can
send
a
message
so
by
some
kind
of
electric
method
one
could
send
a
human
body
from
any
one
part
of
the
world
to
any
other
in
a
moment
this
suggestion
offered
a
fine
field
for
the
imagination
and
there
was
a
novel
written
on
this
subject
which
had
a
great
success
until
the
discovery
itself
was
announced
others
again
thought
that
the
new
discovery
meant
some
great
and
wonderful
development
of
the
destructive
art
so
that
the
whole
of
an
army
might
be
blown
into
countless
fragments
by
the
touch
of
a
button
the
discharge
of
a
spring
the
fall
of
a
hammer
this
took
the
fancy
hugely
and
it
was
pleasant
to
read
the
imaginary
developments
of
history
as
influenced
by
this
discovery
but
it
seemed
certain
that
the
learned
professor
would
keep
it
for
the
use
of
his
own
country
so
that
there
was
no
longer
any
room
to
doubt
that
if
this
was
the
nature
of
the
discovery
the
whole
of
the
habitable
world
must
inevitably
fall
under
the
teutonic
yoke
and
an
empire
of
armed
peace
would
set
in
the
like
of
which
had
never
before
been
witnessed
upon
the
globe
on
the
whole
the
prospect
was
received
everywhere
except
in
france
and
russia
with
resignation
even
the
united
states
remembered
that
they
had
already
many
millions
of
germans
among
them
and
that
the
new
empire
though
it
would
give
certainly
all
the
places
to
these
germans
would
also
save
them
a
great
many
elections
and
therefore
a
good
deal
of
trouble
and
would
relieve
the
national
conscience
long
grievously
oppressed
in
this
particular
of
truckling
to
the
irish
vote
dynamiters
and
anarchists
however
were
despondent
and
socialists
regarded
each
other
with
an
gloom
this
particular
theory
of
the
great
discovery
met
in
fact
with
universal
credence
over
the
whole
civilized
globe
from
the
great
man
himself
there
came
no
sign
enterprising
interviewers
failed
to
get
speech
with
him
scientific
men
wrote
to
him
but
got
no
real
information
in
reply
and
the
minds
of
men
grew
more
and
more
agitated
some
great
change
was
considered
certain
but
what
one
morning
it
was
the
morning
of
thursday
june
there
appeared
an
advertisement
in
the
papers
by
the
telegrams
it
was
discovered
that
a
similar
advertisement
had
been
published
in
every
great
city
all
over
the
world
that
of
the
london
papers
differed
from
others
in
one
important
respect
in
this
namely
professor
schwarzbaum
would
himself
without
any
delay
read
before
a
london
audience
a
paper
which
should
reveal
his
new
discovery
there
was
not
however
the
least
hint
in
the
announcement
of
the
nature
of
this
discovery
yes
said
the
physicist
speaking
slowly
i
have
given
the
particulars
to
my
friends
over
the
whole
earth
and
as
london
is
still
the
centre
of
the
world
i
resolved
that
i
would
myself
communicate
it
to
the
english
but
what
is
it
what
is
it
asked
the
president
the
discovery
the
professor
continued
is
to
be
announced
at
the
same
moment
all
over
the
world
so
that
none
of
the
newspapers
shall
have
an
unfair
start
it
is
now
close
upon
nine
by
london
time
in
paris
it
is
ten
minutes
past
nine
in
berlin
it
is
six
minutes
before
ten
at
petersburg
it
is
eleven
at
new
york
it
is
four
in
the
afternoon
very
good
when
the
clock
in
your
theatre
points
to
nine
exactly
at
that
moment
everywhere
the
same
paper
will
be
read
in
fact
at
that
moment
the
clock
began
to
strike
the
president
led
the
way
to
the
theatre
followed
by
the
council
the
director
remained
behind
with
the
lecturer
of
the
evening
my
friend
said
professor
schwarzbaum
my
subject
is
nothing
less
he
laid
his
finger
upon
the
director
arm
nothing
less
than
prolongation
of
the
vital
energy
what
the
prolongation
of
the
vital
energy
do
you
know
what
that
means
the
director
turned
pale
are
we
to
understand
come
said
the
professor
we
must
not
waste
the
time
then
the
director
startled
and
pale
took
his
german
brother
by
the
arm
and
led
him
into
the
theatre
murmuring
prolongation
prolongation
prolongation
of
the
vital
the
vital
energy
the
theatre
was
crowded
there
was
not
a
vacant
seat
there
was
no
more
standing
room
on
the
stairs
the
very
doors
of
the
gallery
were
thronged
the
great
staircase
was
thronged
with
those
who
could
not
get
in
but
waited
to
get
the
first
news
nay
outside
the
institution
albemarle
street
was
crowded
with
people
waiting
to
hear
what
this
great
thing
might
be
which
all
the
world
had
waited
six
months
to
hear
within
the
theatre
what
an
audience
for
the
first
time
in
english
history
no
respect
at
all
had
been
paid
to
rank
the
people
gathered
in
the
theatre
were
all
that
the
great
city
could
boast
that
was
distinguished
in
science
art
and
letters
those
present
were
the
men
who
moved
the
world
among
them
naturally
a
sprinkling
of
the
men
who
are
born
to
the
best
things
of
the
world
and
are
sometimes
told
that
they
help
to
move
it
there
were
ladies
among
the
company
too
ladies
well
known
in
scientific
and
literary
circles
with
certain
great
ladies
led
by
curiosity
on
the
side
of
the
theatre
for
instance
close
to
the
door
sat
two
very
great
ladies
indeed
one
of
them
the
countess
of
thordis√°
and
the
other
her
only
daughter
the
lady
mildred
carera
leaning
against
the
pillar
beside
them
stood
a
young
man
of
singularly
handsome
appearance
tall
and
commanding
of
stature
to
you
linister
said
the
countess
i
suppose
everything
that
the
professor
has
to
tell
us
will
be
already
well
known
that
said
linister
would
be
too
much
to
expect
for
me
her
ladyship
went
on
delicately
i
love
to
catch
science
on
the
wing
on
the
wing
in
her
lighter
moods
when
she
has
something
really
popular
to
tell
linister
bowed
then
his
eyes
met
those
of
the
beautiful
girl
sitting
below
him
and
he
leaned
and
whispered
i
looked
for
you
everywhere
last
night
you
had
led
me
to
understand
we
went
nowhere
after
all
mamma
fancied
she
had
a
bad
cold
then
this
evening
may
i
be
quite
quite
sure
his
voice
dropped
and
his
fingers
met
hers
beneath
the
fan
she
drew
them
away
quickly
with
a
blush
yes
she
whispered
you
may
find
me
at
lady
chatterton
or
lady
ingleby
from
which
you
can
understand
that
this
young
linister
was
quite
a
man
in
society
he
was
young
he
had
already
a
great
reputation
for
biological
research
he
was
the
only
son
of
a
fashionable
physician
and
he
would
be
very
rich
therefore
in
the
season
harry
linister
was
the
season
on
most
of
the
faces
present
there
sat
an
expression
of
anxiety
and
even
fear
what
was
this
new
thing
was
the
world
really
going
to
be
turned
upside
down
and
when
the
west
end
was
so
very
comfortable
and
its
position
so
very
well
assured
but
there
were
a
few
present
who
rubbed
their
hands
at
the
thought
of
a
great
upturn
of
everything
up
with
the
scum
first
when
that
had
been
ladled
overboard
a
new
arrangement
would
be
possible
to
the
advantage
of
those
who
rubbed
their
hands
when
the
clock
struck
nine
a
dead
silence
fell
upon
the
theatre
not
a
breath
was
heard
not
a
cough
not
the
rustle
of
a
dress
their
faces
were
pale
with
expectancy
their
lips
were
parted
their
very
breathing
seemed
arrested
then
the
president
and
the
council
walked
in
and
took
their
places
ladies
and
gentlemen
said
the
president
shortly
the
learned
professor
will
himself
communicate
to
you
the
subject
and
title
of
his
paper
and
we
may
be
certain
beforehand
that
this
subject
and
matter
will
adorn
the
motto
of
the
society
commoda
then
schwarzbaum
stood
at
the
table
before
them
all
and
looked
round
the
room
lady
mildred
glanced
at
the
young
man
harry
linister
he
was
staring
at
the
german
like
the
rest
speechless
she
sighed
women
did
not
in
those
days
like
to
be
forgotten
or
interrupted
by
anything
certainly
not
by
science
the
learned
german
carried
a
small
bundle
of
papers
which
he
laid
on
the
table
he
carefully
and
slowly
adjusted
his
spectacles
then
he
drew
from
his
pocket
a
small
leather
case
then
he
looked
round
the
room
and
smiled
that
is
to
say
his
lips
were
covered
with
a
full
beard
so
that
the
sweetness
of
the
smile
was
mostly
lost
but
it
was
observed
under
and
behind
the
beard
the
mere
ghost
of
a
smile
yet
a
benevolent
ghost
the
lecturer
began
somewhat
in
fashion
to
remind
his
audience
that
everything
in
nature
is
born
grows
slowly
to
maturity
enjoys
a
brief
period
of
full
force
and
strength
then
decays
and
finally
dies
the
tree
of
life
is
first
a
green
sapling
and
last
a
white
and
leafless
trunk
he
expatiated
at
some
length
on
the
growth
of
the
young
life
he
pointed
out
that
methods
had
been
discovered
to
hinder
that
growth
turn
it
into
unnatural
forms
even
to
stop
and
destroy
it
altogether
he
showed
how
the
body
is
gradually
strengthened
in
all
its
parts
he
showed
for
his
unscientific
hearers
how
the
various
parts
of
the
structure
assume
strength
all
this
was
familiar
to
most
of
his
audience
next
he
proceeded
to
dwell
upon
the
period
of
full
maturity
of
bodily
and
mental
strength
which
in
a
man
should
last
from
to
sixty
and
even
beyond
that
time
the
decay
of
the
bodily
and
even
of
the
mental
organs
may
have
already
set
in
even
when
mind
and
body
seem
the
most
vigorous
at
this
period
of
the
discussion
most
of
the
audience
were
beginning
to
flag
in
their
attention
was
such
a
gathering
as
this
assembled
only
to
hear
a
discussion
on
the
growth
and
decay
of
the
faculties
but
the
director
who
knew
what
was
coming
sat
bolt
upright
expectant
it
was
strange
the
people
said
afterwards
that
no
one
should
have
suspected
what
was
coming
there
was
to
be
everybody
knew
a
great
announcement
that
was
certain
destruction
locomotion
food
transmission
of
thought
substitution
of
speech
for
writing
all
these
things
as
has
been
seen
had
been
suggested
but
no
one
even
guessed
the
real
nature
of
the
discovery
and
now
with
the
exception
of
the
people
who
always
pretend
to
have
known
all
along
to
have
been
favored
with
the
great
confidence
to
have
guessed
the
thing
from
the
outset
no
one
had
the
least
suspicion
therefore
when
the
professor
suddenly
stopped
short
after
a
prolix
description
of
wasting
power
and
wearied
organs
and
held
up
an
admonitory
finger
everybody
jumped
because
now
the
secret
was
to
be
divulged
they
had
come
to
hear
a
great
secret
what
is
this
decay
he
asked
what
is
it
why
does
it
begin
what
laws
regulate
it
what
check
can
we
place
upon
it
how
can
we
prevent
it
how
can
we
stay
its
progress
can
science
which
has
done
so
much
to
make
life
happy
which
has
found
out
so
many
things
by
which
brief
span
is
crowded
with
delightful
emotions
can
science
do
no
more
can
not
science
add
to
these
gifts
that
more
precious
gift
of
all
the
lengthening
of
that
brief
span
here
everybody
gasped
i
ask
the
speaker
went
on
whether
science
can
not
put
off
that
day
which
closes
the
eyes
and
turns
the
body
into
a
senseless
lump
consider
we
are
no
sooner
arrived
at
the
goal
of
our
ambitions
than
we
have
to
go
away
we
are
no
sooner
at
the
plenitude
of
our
wisdom
and
knowledge
than
we
have
to
lay
down
all
that
we
have
learned
and
go
away
nay
we
can
not
even
transmit
to
others
our
accumulations
of
knowledge
they
are
lost
we
are
no
sooner
happy
with
those
we
love
than
we
have
to
leave
them
we
collect
but
can
not
enjoy
we
inherit
it
is
but
for
a
day
we
learn
but
we
have
no
time
to
use
our
learning
we
love
it
is
but
for
an
hour
we
pass
our
youth
in
hope
our
manhood
in
effort
and
we
die
before
we
are
old
we
are
strong
but
our
strength
passes
like
a
dream
we
are
beautiful
but
our
beauty
perishes
in
a
single
day
can
not
i
ask
again
can
not
science
prolong
the
vital
force
and
stay
the
destroying
hand
of
decay
at
this
point
a
wonderful
passion
seized
upon
many
of
the
people
present
for
some
sprang
to
their
feet
and
lifted
hands
and
shouted
some
wept
aloud
some
clasped
each
other
by
the
hand
there
were
lovers
among
the
crowd
who
fell
openly
into
each
other
arms
there
were
men
of
learning
who
hugged
imaginary
books
and
looked
up
with
wild
eyes
there
were
girls
who
smiled
thinking
that
their
beauty
might
last
longer
than
a
day
there
were
women
down
whose
cheeks
rolled
the
tears
of
sorrow
for
their
vanished
beauty
there
were
old
men
who
heard
and
trembled
one
of
them
spoke
out
of
all
this
crowd
only
one
found
words
it
was
an
old
statesman
an
old
man
eloquent
he
rose
with
shaking
limbs
sir
he
cried
his
voice
still
sonorous
give
me
back
my
manhood
the
professor
continued
regardless
suppose
he
said
that
science
had
found
out
the
way
not
to
restore
what
is
lost
but
to
arrest
further
loss
not
to
give
back
what
is
gone
you
might
as
well
try
to
restore
a
leg
that
has
been
cut
off
but
to
prevent
further
loss
consider
this
for
a
moment
i
pray
you
those
who
search
into
nature
secrets
might
if
this
were
done
for
them
carry
on
their
investigations
far
beyond
any
point
which
had
yet
been
reached
those
who
cultivate
art
might
attain
to
a
greater
skill
of
hand
and
truth
of
sight
than
has
ever
yet
been
seen
those
who
study
human
nature
might
multiply
their
observations
those
who
love
might
have
a
longer
time
for
their
passion
men
who
are
strong
might
remain
strong
women
who
are
beautiful
might
remain
beautiful
sir
cried
again
the
old
man
eloquent
give
me
back
my
manhood
the
lecturer
made
no
reply
but
went
on
the
rich
might
have
a
time
a
sensible
length
of
time
in
which
to
enjoy
their
wealth
the
young
might
remain
young
the
old
might
grow
no
older
the
feeble
might
not
become
more
feeble
all
for
a
prolonged
time
as
for
those
whose
lives
could
never
become
anything
but
a
burden
to
themselves
and
to
the
rest
of
the
world
the
crippled
the
criminal
the
poor
the
imbecile
the
incompetent
the
stupid
and
the
frivolous
they
would
live
out
their
allotted
lives
and
die
it
would
be
for
the
salt
of
the
earth
for
the
flower
of
mankind
for
the
men
strong
of
intellect
and
endowed
above
the
common
herd
that
science
would
reserve
this
precious
gift
give
me
back
my
manhood
cried
again
the
old
man
eloquent
but
he
was
not
alone
for
they
all
sprang
to
their
feet
together
and
cried
aloud
shrieking
weeping
stretching
forth
hands
give
give
give
but
the
director
who
knew
that
what
was
asked
for
would
be
given
sat
silent
and
the
speaker
motioned
them
all
to
sit
down
again
i
would
not
he
said
limit
this
great
gift
to
those
alone
whose
intellect
leads
the
world
i
would
extend
it
to
all
who
help
to
make
life
beautiful
and
happy
to
lovely
women
here
the
men
heaved
a
sigh
so
deep
so
simultaneous
that
it
fell
upon
the
ear
like
the
voice
of
thanksgiving
from
a
cathedral
choir
to
those
who
love
only
the
empty
show
and
pleasures
and
vainglories
of
life
here
many
smiled
especially
of
the
younger
sort
even
to
some
of
those
who
desire
nothing
of
life
but
love
and
song
and
dalliance
and
laughter
again
the
younger
sort
smiled
and
tried
to
look
as
if
they
had
no
connection
at
all
with
that
band
i
would
extend
this
gift
i
repeat
to
all
who
can
themselves
be
happy
in
the
sunshine
and
the
light
and
to
all
who
can
make
the
happiness
of
others
then
again
consider
when
you
have
enjoyed
those
things
for
a
while
when
your
life
has
been
prolonged
so
that
you
have
enjoyed
all
that
you
desire
in
full
measure
and
running
over
when
not
two
or
three
years
have
passed
but
perhaps
two
or
three
centuries
you
would
then
of
your
own
accord
put
aside
the
aid
of
science
and
suffer
your
body
to
fall
into
the
decay
which
awaits
all
living
matter
contented
and
resigned
you
would
sink
into
the
tomb
not
satiated
with
the
joys
of
life
but
satisfied
to
have
had
your
share
there
would
be
no
terror
in
death
since
it
would
take
none
but
those
who
could
say
have
had
enough
that
day
would
surely
come
to
every
one
there
is
nothing
not
research
and
discovery
not
the
beauty
of
nature
not
love
and
pleasure
not
art
not
flowers
and
sunshine
and
perpetual
youth
of
which
we
should
not
in
time
grow
weary
science
can
not
alter
the
laws
of
nature
of
all
things
there
must
be
an
end
but
she
can
prolong
she
can
avert
she
can
yes
my
friends
this
is
my
discovery
this
is
my
gift
to
humanity
this
is
the
fruit
the
outcome
of
my
life
for
me
this
great
thing
has
been
reserved
science
can
arrest
decay
she
can
make
you
live
live
on
live
for
centuries
nay
i
know
not
why
not
she
can
if
you
foolishly
desire
it
make
you
live
forever
now
when
these
words
were
spoken
there
fell
a
deep
silence
upon
the
crowd
no
one
spoke
no
one
looked
up
they
were
awed
they
could
not
realize
what
it
meant
that
would
be
given
them
they
were
suddenly
relieved
of
a
great
terror
the
constant
dread
that
lies
in
heart
ever
present
though
we
conceal
it
the
dread
of
death
but
they
could
not
in
a
moment
understand
that
it
was
given
but
the
director
sprang
to
his
feet
and
grasped
his
brother
physicist
by
the
hand
of
all
the
sons
of
science
he
said
solemnly
thou
shalt
be
proclaimed
the
first
and
best
the
assembly
heard
these
words
but
made
no
sign
there
was
no
applause
not
a
murmur
not
a
voice
they
were
stricken
dumb
with
wonder
and
with
awe
they
were
going
to
live
to
live
on
to
live
for
centuries
nay
why
not
to
live
forever
you
all
know
the
professor
continued
how
at
a
dinner
a
single
glass
of
champagne
revives
the
spirits
looses
the
tongue
and
brings
activity
to
the
brain
the
guests
were
weary
they
were
in
decay
the
champagne
arrests
that
decay
my
discovery
is
of
another
kind
of
champagne
which
acts
with
a
more
lasting
effect
it
strengthens
the
nerves
hardens
the
muscles
quickens
the
blood
and
brings
activity
to
the
digestion
with
new
strength
of
the
body
returns
new
strength
to
the
mind
mind
and
body
are
one
he
paused
a
moment
then
he
gave
the
leather
case
into
the
hands
of
the
director
this
is
my
gift
i
say
i
give
to
my
brother
full
particulars
and
the
history
of
the
invention
i
seek
no
profit
for
myself
it
is
your
own
this
day
a
new
epoch
begins
for
humanity
we
shall
not
die
but
live
accident
fire
lightning
may
kill
us
against
these
things
we
can
not
guard
but
old
age
shall
no
more
fall
upon
us
decay
shall
no
more
rob
us
of
our
life
and
strength
and
death
shall
be
voluntary
this
is
a
great
change
i
know
not
if
i
have
done
aright
that
is
for
you
to
determine
see
that
you
use
this
gift
aright
then
before
the
people
had
understood
the
last
words
the
speaker
stepped
out
of
the
theatre
and
was
gone
but
the
director
of
the
royal
institution
stood
in
his
place
and
in
his
hand
was
the
leather
case
containing
the
gift
of
life
the
countess
of
thordis√°
who
had
been
asleep
throughout
the
lecture
woke
up
when
it
was
finished
how
deeply
interesting
she
sighed
this
it
is
to
catch
science
on
the
wing
then
she
looked
round
mildred
dear
she
said
has
linister
gone
to
find
the
carriage
dear
me
what
a
commotion
and
at
the
royal
institution
of
all
places
in
the
world
i
think
mamma
said
lady
mildred
coldly
that
we
had
better
get
some
one
else
to
find
the
carriage
linister
is
over
there
he
is
better
engaged
he
was
he
was
among
his
brother
physicists
they
were
eagerly
asking
questions
and
crowding
round
the
director
and
the
theatre
seemed
filled
with
mad
people
who
surged
and
crowded
and
pushed
come
mamma
said
lady
mildred
pale
but
with
a
red
spot
on
either
cheek
we
will
leave
them
to
fight
it
out
science
had
beaten
love
she
did
not
meet
harry
linister
again
that
night
and
when
they
met
again
long
years
afterwards
he
passed
her
by
with
eyes
that
showed
he
had
clean
forgotten
her
existence
unaltered
though
she
was
in
face
and
form
chapter
i
the
when
the
big
bell
in
the
tower
of
the
house
of
life
struck
the
hour
of
seven
the
other
bells
began
to
chime
as
they
had
done
every
day
at
this
hour
for
i
know
not
how
many
years
very
likely
in
the
library
where
we
still
keep
a
great
collection
of
perfectly
useless
books
there
is
preserved
some
history
which
may
speak
of
these
bells
and
of
the
builders
of
the
house
when
these
chimes
began
the
swifts
and
jackdaws
which
live
in
the
tower
began
to
fly
about
with
a
great
show
of
hurry
as
if
there
was
barely
time
for
supper
though
as
it
was
yet
only
the
month
of
july
the
sun
would
not
be
setting
for
an
hour
or
more
we
have
long
since
ceased
to
preach
to
the
people
otherwise
we
might
make
them
learn
a
great
deal
from
the
animal
world
they
live
for
instance
from
day
to
day
not
only
are
their
lives
miserably
short
but
they
are
always
hungry
always
fighting
always
quarrelling
always
fierce
in
their
loves
and
their
jealousies
watching
the
swifts
for
instance
which
we
may
do
nearly
all
day
long
we
ought
to
congratulate
ourselves
on
our
own
leisurely
order
the
adequate
provision
for
food
made
by
the
wisdom
of
the
college
the
assurance
of
preservation
also
established
by
that
wisdom
and
our
freedom
from
haste
and
anxiety
as
from
the
emotions
of
love
hatred
jealousy
and
rivalry
but
the
time
has
gone
by
for
that
kind
of
exhortation
thus
our
people
who
at
this
hour
crowded
the
great
square
showed
in
their
faces
their
attitudes
and
their
movements
the
calm
that
reigned
in
their
souls
some
were
lying
on
the
grass
some
were
sitting
on
the
benches
some
were
strolling
they
were
for
the
most
part
alone
if
not
alone
because
habit
often
survives
when
the
original
cause
of
the
habit
is
gone
then
in
pairs
in
the
old
unhappy
days
there
would
have
been
restless
activity
a
hurrying
to
and
fro
there
would
have
been
laughter
and
talking
everybody
would
have
been
talking
there
would
have
been
young
men
eagerly
courting
the
favors
of
young
women
looking
on
them
with
longing
eyes
ready
to
fight
for
them
each
for
the
girl
he
loved
thinking
each
of
the
girl
he
loved
as
of
a
goddess
or
an
angel
all
perfection
the
girls
themselves
ardently
desired
this
foolish
worship
again
formerly
there
would
have
been
old
men
and
old
women
looking
with
melancholy
eyes
on
the
scenes
they
were
about
to
quit
and
lamenting
the
days
of
their
strength
and
their
youth
and
formerly
there
would
have
been
among
the
crowd
beggars
and
paupers
there
would
have
been
some
masters
and
some
servants
some
noble
and
some
bourgeois
there
would
have
been
every
conceivable
difference
in
age
rank
strength
intellect
and
distinction
again
formerly
there
would
have
been
the
most
insolent
differences
in
costume
some
of
the
men
used
to
wear
broadcloth
sleek
and
smooth
with
glossy
hats
and
gloves
and
flowers
at
their
while
beside
them
crawled
the
wretched
objects
pretending
to
sell
matches
but
in
reality
begging
for
their
bread
and
some
of
the
women
used
to
flaunt
in
dainty
and
expensive
stuffs
setting
off
their
supposed
charms
which
were
mostly
made
by
the
art
with
the
curves
and
colors
of
their
drapery
and
beside
them
would
be
crawling
the
wretched
creatures
to
whom
in
the
summer
when
the
days
were
hot
and
fine
the
park
was
their
only
home
and
rusty
black
their
only
wear
now
no
activity
at
all
no
hurrying
no
laughing
not
even
any
talking
that
might
have
struck
a
visitor
as
one
of
the
most
remarkable
results
of
our
system
no
foolish
talking
as
for
their
dress
it
was
all
alike
the
men
wore
blue
flannel
jackets
and
trousers
with
a
flannel
shirt
and
a
flat
blue
cap
for
the
working
hours
they
had
a
rougher
dress
the
women
wore
a
costume
in
gray
made
of
a
stuff
called
beige
it
is
a
useful
stuff
because
it
wears
well
it
is
soft
and
yet
warm
and
can
not
be
objected
to
by
any
of
them
on
the
score
of
ugliness
what
mutinies
what
secret
conspiracies
what
mad
revolts
had
to
be
faced
before
the
women
could
be
made
to
understand
that
socialism
the
only
form
of
society
which
can
now
be
accepted
must
be
logical
and
complete
what
is
one
woman
more
than
another
that
she
should
separate
herself
from
her
sisters
by
her
dress
therefore
since
their
subjugation
they
all
wear
a
gray
beige
frock
with
a
jacket
of
the
same
and
a
flat
gray
cap
like
the
men
under
which
they
are
made
to
gather
up
their
hair
this
scene
indeed
the
gathering
of
the
people
before
the
is
one
of
which
i
never
tire
i
look
at
all
the
eager
hurrying
swifts
in
the
air
i
remember
the
past
and
i
think
of
the
present
when
i
gaze
upon
the
great
multitude
in
which
no
one
regardeth
his
neighbor
none
speaks
to
none
there
are
no
individual
aims
but
all
is
pure
unadulterated
socialism
with
not
far
distant
the
ultimate
triumph
of
science
i
desire
to
relate
the
exact
circumstances
connected
with
certain
recent
events
it
is
generally
known
that
they
caused
one
deplorable
death
one
of
our
own
society
although
not
a
physician
of
the
house
i
shall
have
to
explain
before
i
begin
the
narrative
certain
points
in
our
internal
management
which
may
differ
from
the
customs
adopted
elsewhere
we
of
the
later
era
visit
each
other
so
seldom
that
differences
may
easily
grow
up
indeed
considering
the
terrible
dangers
of
travel
how
if
one
walks
there
are
the
perils
of
unfiltered
water
damp
beds
sprained
ankles
byrsitis
of
the
knee
chills
from
frosts
and
showers
or
if
one
gets
into
a
wheeled
vehicle
the
wheels
may
fall
off
or
the
carriage
may
be
overturned
in
a
ditch
but
why
pursue
the
subject
i
repeat
therefore
that
i
must
speak
of
the
community
and
its
order
but
that
as
briefly
as
may
be
the
rebels
have
been
driven
forth
from
the
pale
of
humanity
to
wander
where
they
please
in
a
few
years
they
will
be
released
if
that
has
not
already
happened
by
death
from
the
diseases
and
sufferings
which
will
fall
upon
them
then
we
shall
remember
them
no
more
the
centuries
will
roll
by
and
they
shall
be
forgotten
the
very
mounds
of
earth
which
once
marked
the
place
of
their
burial
will
be
level
with
the
ground
around
them
but
the
house
and
the
glory
of
the
house
will
continue
thus
perish
all
the
enemies
of
science
the
city
of
canterbury
as
it
was
rebuilt
when
socialism
was
finally
established
has
in
its
centre
a
great
square
park
or
garden
the
central
and
relaxation
ground
of
the
city
each
side
is
exactly
half
a
mile
in
length
the
garden
thus
occupying
an
area
of
a
fourth
of
a
square
mile
is
planted
with
every
kind
of
ornamental
tree
and
laid
out
in
winding
walks
serpentine
rivers
lakes
cascades
bridges
grottos
lawns
and
everything
that
can
help
to
make
the
place
attractive
during
the
summer
it
is
thronged
every
evening
with
the
people
on
its
west
side
has
been
erected
an
enormous
palace
of
glass
low
in
height
but
stretching
far
away
to
the
west
covering
an
immense
area
here
the
heat
is
artificially
maintained
at
temperatures
varying
with
the
season
and
the
plants
that
are
in
cultivation
in
winter
frost
bad
weather
and
in
rain
it
forms
a
place
of
recreation
and
rest
here
grow
all
kinds
of
with
all
kinds
of
vegetables
flowers
and
plants
all
the
year
round
it
furnishes
in
quantities
sufficient
for
all
our
wants
an
endless
supply
of
fruit
so
that
we
have
a
supply
of
some
during
the
whole
year
as
grapes
bananas
and
oranges
others
for
at
least
half
the
year
as
peaches
strawberries
and
so
forth
while
of
the
commoner
vegetables
as
peas
beans
and
the
like
there
is
now
no
season
but
they
are
grown
continuously
in
the
old
times
we
were
dependent
upon
the
changes
and
chances
of
a
capricious
and
variable
climate
now
not
only
has
the
erection
of
these
vast
houses
made
us
independent
of
summer
and
winter
but
the
placing
of
much
grass
and
corn
land
under
glass
has
also
assured
our
crops
and
secured
us
from
the
danger
of
famine
this
is
by
no
means
one
of
the
least
advantages
of
modern
civilization
on
the
south
side
of
the
square
stands
our
public
hall
the
building
has
not
like
the
house
of
life
any
architectural
beauty
why
should
we
aim
at
beauty
when
efficiency
is
our
sole
object
the
house
of
life
was
designed
and
erected
when
men
thought
perpetually
of
beauty
working
from
their
admiration
of
beauty
in
woman
and
in
nature
to
beauty
in
things
which
they
made
with
their
own
hands
setting
beauty
above
usefulness
even
thinking
it
necessary
when
usefulness
had
been
attained
to
add
adornment
as
when
they
added
a
tower
to
the
house
of
life
yet
did
nothing
with
their
tower
and
did
not
want
it
the
public
hall
is
built
of
red
brick
it
resembles
a
row
of
houses
each
with
a
gable
to
the
street
there
is
for
each
a
broad
plain
door
with
a
simple
porch
below
and
above
a
broad
plain
window
twenty
feet
wide
divided
into
four
compartments
or
divisions
the
whole
set
in
a
framework
of
wood
the
appearance
of
the
hall
is
therefore
remarkably
plain
there
are
of
these
gables
each
forty
feet
wide
so
that
the
whole
length
of
the
hall
is
twelve
hundred
and
forty
feet
or
nearly
a
quarter
of
a
mile
within
the
roof
of
each
of
these
gables
covers
a
hall
separated
from
its
neighbors
by
plain
columns
they
are
all
alike
except
that
the
middle
hall
set
apart
for
the
college
has
a
gallery
originally
intended
for
an
orchestra
now
never
used
in
the
central
hall
one
table
alone
is
placed
in
all
the
others
there
are
four
every
hall
accommodating
eight
hundred
people
and
every
table
two
hundred
the
length
of
each
hall
is
the
same
namely
two
hundred
and
fifty
feet
the
hall
is
lit
by
one
large
window
at
each
end
there
are
no
carvings
sculptures
or
other
ornaments
in
the
building
at
the
back
is
an
extensive
range
of
buildings
all
of
brick
built
in
small
compartments
and
they
contain
the
kitchens
granaries
larders
cellars
dairies
pantries
ovens
breweries
and
all
the
other
offices
and
chambers
required
for
the
daily
provisioning
of
a
city
with
thousand
inhabitants
on
the
east
side
of
the
square
there
are
two
great
groups
of
buildings
that
nearest
to
the
public
hall
contains
in
a
series
of
buildings
which
communicate
with
one
another
the
library
the
museum
the
armory
the
and
the
picture
gallery
the
last
is
a
building
as
old
as
the
house
they
were
when
these
events
began
open
to
the
whole
community
though
they
were
never
visited
by
any
even
out
of
idle
curiosity
the
inquisitive
spirit
is
dead
for
myself
i
am
not
anxious
to
see
the
people
acquire
or
revive
the
habit
of
reading
and
inquiring
it
might
be
argued
that
the
study
of
history
might
make
them
contrast
the
present
with
the
past
and
shudder
at
the
lot
of
their
forefathers
but
i
am
going
to
show
that
this
study
may
produce
quite
the
opposite
effect
or
there
is
the
study
of
science
how
should
this
help
the
people
they
have
the
college
always
studying
and
investigating
for
their
benefit
the
secrets
of
medical
science
which
alone
concerns
their
happiness
they
might
learn
how
to
make
machines
but
machinery
requires
steam
explosives
electricity
and
other
uncontrolled
and
dangerous
forces
many
thousands
of
lives
were
formerly
lost
in
the
making
and
management
of
these
machines
and
we
do
very
well
without
them
they
might
it
is
true
read
the
books
which
tell
of
the
people
in
former
times
but
why
read
works
which
are
filled
with
the
presence
of
death
the
shortness
of
life
and
the
intensity
of
passions
which
we
have
almost
forgotten
you
shall
see
what
comes
of
these
studies
which
seem
so
innocent
i
say
therefore
that
i
never
had
any
wish
to
see
the
people
flocking
into
the
library
for
the
same
reason
that
a
study
and
contemplation
of
things
past
might
unsettle
or
disturb
the
tranquillity
of
their
minds
i
have
never
wished
to
see
them
in
the
museum
the
armory
or
any
other
part
of
our
collections
and
since
the
events
of
which
i
have
to
tell
we
have
enclosed
these
buildings
and
added
them
to
the
college
so
that
the
people
can
no
longer
enter
them
even
if
they
wished
the
curator
of
the
museum
was
an
aged
man
one
of
the
few
old
men
left
in
the
old
days
he
had
held
a
title
of
some
kind
he
was
placed
there
because
he
was
old
and
much
broken
and
could
do
no
work
therefore
he
was
told
to
keep
the
free
from
dust
and
to
sweep
the
floors
every
morning
at
the
time
of
the
great
discovery
he
had
been
an
earl
or
viscount
i
know
not
what
and
by
some
accident
he
escaped
the
great
slaughter
when
it
was
resolved
to
kill
all
the
old
men
and
women
in
order
to
reduce
the
population
to
the
number
which
the
land
would
support
i
believe
that
he
hid
himself
and
was
secretly
fed
by
some
man
who
had
formerly
been
his
groom
and
still
preserved
some
remains
of
what
he
called
attachment
and
duty
until
such
time
as
the
executions
were
over
then
he
ventured
forth
again
and
so
great
was
the
horror
of
the
recent
massacre
with
the
recollection
of
the
prayers
and
shrieks
of
the
victims
that
he
was
allowed
to
continue
alive
the
old
man
was
troubled
with
an
asthma
which
hardly
permitted
him
an
hour
of
repose
and
was
incurable
this
would
have
made
his
life
intolerable
except
that
to
live
only
to
live
in
any
pain
and
misery
is
always
better
than
to
die
for
the
last
few
years
the
old
man
had
a
companion
in
the
museum
this
was
a
girl
the
only
girl
in
our
community
who
called
him
i
know
not
why
perhaps
because
the
relationship
really
existed
grandfather
and
lived
with
him
she
it
was
who
dusted
the
cases
and
swept
the
floors
she
found
some
means
of
relieving
the
old
man
asthma
and
all
day
long
would
that
i
had
discovered
the
fact
or
suspected
whither
it
would
lead
the
wretched
girl
she
read
the
books
of
the
library
and
studied
the
contents
of
the
cases
and
talked
to
the
old
man
making
him
tell
her
everything
that
belonged
to
the
past
all
she
cared
for
was
the
past
all
that
she
studied
was
to
understand
more
and
more
how
men
lived
then
and
what
they
thought
and
what
they
talked
she
was
about
eighteen
years
of
age
but
indeed
we
thought
her
still
a
child
i
know
not
how
many
years
had
elapsed
since
any
in
the
city
were
children
because
it
is
a
vain
thing
to
keep
account
of
the
years
if
anything
happens
to
distinguish
them
it
must
be
something
disastrous
because
we
have
now
arrived
almost
at
the
last
stage
possible
to
man
it
only
remains
for
us
to
discover
not
only
how
to
prevent
disease
but
how
to
annihilate
it
since
then
there
is
only
one
step
left
to
take
in
advance
every
other
event
which
can
happen
must
be
in
the
nature
of
a
calamity
and
therefore
may
be
forgotten
i
have
said
that
christine
called
the
old
man
her
grandfather
we
have
long
long
since
agreed
to
forget
old
ties
of
blood
how
can
father
and
son
mother
and
daughter
brother
and
sister
continue
for
hundreds
of
years
and
when
all
remain
fixed
at
the
same
age
to
keep
up
the
old
relationship
the
maternal
love
dies
out
with
us
it
is
now
but
seldom
called
into
existence
when
the
child
can
run
about
why
not
the
animals
from
whom
we
learn
so
much
desert
their
offspring
when
they
can
feed
themselves
our
mothers
cease
to
care
for
their
children
when
they
are
old
enough
to
be
the
charge
of
the
community
therefore
christine
mother
cheerfully
suffered
the
child
to
leave
her
as
soon
as
she
was
old
enough
to
sit
in
the
public
hall
her
grandfather
if
indeed
he
was
her
grandfather
obtained
permission
to
have
the
child
with
him
so
she
remained
in
the
quiet
museum
we
never
imagined
or
suspected
however
that
the
old
man
who
was
eighty
at
the
time
of
the
great
discovery
remembered
everything
that
took
place
when
he
was
young
and
talked
with
the
girl
all
day
long
about
the
past
i
do
not
know
who
was
christine
father
it
matters
not
now
and
indeed
he
never
claimed
his
daughter
one
smiles
to
think
of
the
importance
formerly
attached
to
fathers
we
no
longer
work
for
their
support
we
are
no
longer
dependent
upon
their
assistance
the
father
does
nothing
for
the
son
nor
the
son
for
the
father
five
hundred
years
ago
say
or
a
thousand
years
ago
the
father
carried
a
baby
in
his
arms
what
then
my
own
father
i
believe
he
is
my
own
father
but
on
this
point
i
may
be
mistaken
i
saw
yesterday
taking
his
turn
in
the
he
seemed
distressed
with
the
heat
and
fatigue
of
it
why
not
it
makes
no
difference
to
me
he
is
though
not
so
young
still
as
strong
and
as
as
myself
christine
was
called
into
existence
by
the
sanction
of
the
college
when
one
of
the
community
was
struck
dead
by
lightning
it
was
my
brother
i
believe
the
terrible
event
filled
us
all
with
consternation
however
the
population
having
thus
been
diminished
by
one
it
was
resolved
that
the
loss
should
be
repaired
there
was
precedent
a
great
many
years
previously
owing
to
a
man
being
killed
by
the
fall
of
a
all
are
now
made
low
another
birth
had
been
allowed
that
was
a
boy
let
us
now
return
to
our
square
on
the
same
side
are
the
buildings
of
the
college
here
are
the
anatomical
collections
the
storehouse
of
materia
medica
and
the
residences
of
the
arch
physician
the
suffragan
the
fellows
of
the
college
or
associate
physicians
and
the
assistants
or
experimenters
the
buildings
are
plain
and
the
college
has
its
own
private
gardens
which
are
large
and
filled
with
trees
here
the
physicians
walk
and
meditate
undisturbed
by
the
outer
world
here
is
also
their
library
on
the
north
side
of
the
square
stands
the
great
and
venerable
house
of
life
the
glory
of
the
city
the
pride
of
the
whole
country
it
is
very
ancient
formerly
there
were
many
such
splendid
monuments
standing
in
the
country
now
this
alone
remains
it
was
built
in
the
dim
distant
ages
when
men
believed
things
now
forgotten
it
was
designed
for
the
celebration
of
certain
ceremonies
or
functions
their
nature
and
meaning
may
i
dare
say
be
ascertained
by
any
who
cares
to
waste
time
in
an
inquiry
so
useless
the
edifice
itself
could
not
possibly
be
built
in
these
times
first
because
we
have
no
artificers
capable
of
rearing
such
a
pile
and
next
because
we
have
not
among
us
any
one
capable
of
conceiving
it
or
drawing
the
design
of
it
nay
we
have
none
who
could
execute
the
carved
i
do
not
say
this
with
humility
but
with
satisfaction
for
if
we
contemplate
the
building
we
must
acknowledge
that
though
it
is
as
i
have
said
the
glory
of
the
city
and
though
it
is
vast
in
proportions
imposing
by
its
grandeur
and
splendid
in
its
work
yet
most
of
it
is
perfectly
useless
what
need
of
the
tall
columns
to
support
a
roof
which
might
very
well
have
been
the
present
height
why
build
the
tower
at
all
what
is
the
good
of
the
carved
work
we
of
the
new
era
build
in
brick
which
is
we
put
up
structures
which
are
no
larger
than
are
wanted
we
waste
no
labor
because
we
grudge
the
time
which
must
be
spent
in
necessary
work
over
things
unnecessary
besides
we
are
no
longer
tortured
by
the
feverish
anxiety
to
do
something
anything
by
which
we
may
be
remembered
when
the
short
span
of
life
is
past
death
to
us
is
a
thing
which
may
happen
by
accident
but
not
from
old
age
or
by
disease
why
should
men
toil
and
trouble
in
order
to
be
remembered
all
things
are
equal
why
should
one
man
try
to
do
something
better
than
another
or
what
another
can
not
do
or
what
is
useless
when
it
is
done
sculptures
pictures
art
of
any
kind
will
not
add
a
single
ear
of
corn
to
the
general
stock
or
a
single
glass
of
wine
or
a
yard
of
flannel
therefore
we
need
not
regret
the
decay
of
art
as
everybody
knows
however
the
house
is
the
chief
laboratory
of
the
whole
country
it
is
here
that
the
great
secret
is
preserved
it
is
known
to
the
arch
physician
and
to
his
suffragan
alone
no
other
man
in
the
country
knows
by
what
process
is
compounded
that
potent
liquid
which
arrests
decay
and
prolongs
life
apparently
without
any
bound
or
limit
i
say
without
any
bound
or
limit
there
certainly
are
croakers
who
maintain
that
at
some
future
time
it
may
be
this
very
year
it
may
be
a
thousand
years
hence
the
compound
will
lose
its
power
and
so
we
all
of
us
even
the
college
must
then
inevitably
begin
to
decay
and
after
a
few
short
years
perish
and
sink
into
the
silent
grave
the
very
thought
causes
a
horror
too
dreadful
for
words
the
limbs
tremble
the
teeth
chatter
but
others
declare
that
there
is
no
fear
whatever
of
this
result
and
that
the
only
dread
is
lest
the
whole
college
should
suddenly
be
struck
by
lightning
and
so
the
secret
be
lost
for
though
none
other
than
the
arch
physician
and
his
suffragan
know
the
secret
the
whole
society
the
fellows
or
assistant
physicians
know
in
what
strong
place
the
secret
is
kept
in
writing
just
as
it
was
communicated
by
the
discoverer
the
fellows
of
the
college
all
assist
in
the
production
of
this
precious
liquid
which
is
made
only
in
the
house
of
life
but
none
of
them
know
whether
they
are
working
for
the
great
arcanum
itself
or
on
some
of
the
many
experiments
conducted
for
the
arch
physician
even
if
one
guessed
he
would
not
dare
to
communicate
his
suspicions
even
to
a
being
forbidden
under
the
most
awful
of
all
penalties
that
of
death
itself
to
divulge
the
experiments
and
processes
that
he
is
ordered
to
carry
out
it
is
needless
to
say
that
if
we
are
proud
of
the
house
we
are
equally
proud
of
the
city
there
was
formerly
an
old
canterbury
of
which
pictures
exist
in
the
library
the
streets
of
that
town
were
narrow
and
winding
the
houses
were
irregular
in
height
size
and
style
there
were
close
courts
not
six
feet
broad
in
which
no
air
could
circulate
and
where
fevers
and
other
disorders
were
bred
some
houses
again
stood
in
stately
gardens
while
others
had
none
at
all
and
the
owners
of
the
gardens
kept
them
closed
but
we
can
easily
understand
what
might
have
happened
when
private
property
was
recognized
and
laws
protected
the
rights
of
owners
now
that
there
is
no
property
there
are
no
laws
there
are
also
no
crimes
because
there
is
no
incentive
to
jealousy
rapine
or
where
there
is
no
crime
there
is
that
condition
of
innocence
which
our
ancestors
so
eagerly
desired
and
sought
by
means
which
were
perfectly
certain
to
fail
how
different
is
the
canterbury
of
the
present
first
like
all
modern
towns
it
is
limited
in
size
there
are
in
it
thousand
inhabitants
neither
more
nor
less
round
its
great
central
square
or
garden
are
the
public
buildings
the
streets
which
branch
off
at
right
angles
are
all
of
the
same
width
the
same
length
and
the
same
appearance
they
are
planted
with
trees
the
houses
are
built
of
red
brick
each
house
containing
four
rooms
on
the
namely
two
on
either
side
the
door
and
four
on
the
first
floor
with
a
the
rooms
are
vaulted
with
brick
so
that
there
is
no
fear
of
fire
every
room
has
its
own
occupant
and
as
all
the
rooms
are
of
the
same
size
and
are
all
furnished
in
the
same
way
with
the
same
regard
to
comfort
and
warmth
there
is
really
no
ground
for
complaint
or
jealousies
the
occupants
also
who
have
the
same
meals
in
the
same
hall
every
day
can
not
complain
of
inequalities
any
more
than
they
can
accuse
each
other
of
gluttonous
living
in
the
matter
of
clothes
again
it
was
at
first
expected
that
the
grave
difficulties
with
the
women
as
to
uniformity
of
fashion
and
of
material
would
continue
to
trouble
us
but
with
the
decay
of
those
emotions
which
formerly
caused
so
much
trouble
since
the
men
have
ceased
to
court
the
women
and
the
women
have
ceased
to
desire
men
admiration
there
has
been
no
opposition
all
of
them
now
are
clad
alike
gray
is
found
the
most
convenient
color
soft
beige
the
most
convenient
material
the
same
beautiful
equality
rules
the
hours
and
methods
of
work
five
hours
a
day
are
found
ample
and
everybody
takes
his
time
at
every
kind
of
work
the
men
work
being
kept
separate
from
that
given
to
the
women
i
confess
that
the
work
is
not
performed
with
as
much
zeal
as
one
could
wish
but
think
of
the
old
times
when
one
had
to
work
eight
ten
and
even
eighteen
hours
a
day
in
order
to
earn
a
poor
and
miserable
subsistence
what
zeal
could
they
have
put
into
their
work
how
different
is
this
glorious
equality
in
all
things
from
the
ancient
anomalies
and
injustices
of
class
and
rank
wealth
and
poverty
why
formerly
the
chief
pursuit
of
man
was
the
pursuit
of
money
and
now
there
is
no
money
at
all
and
our
wealth
lies
in
our
barns
and
garners
i
must
be
forgiven
if
i
dwell
upon
these
contrasts
the
history
which
has
to
be
told
how
an
attempt
was
actually
made
to
destroy
this
eden
and
to
substitute
in
its
place
the
old
condition
of
things
fills
me
with
such
indignation
that
i
am
constrained
to
speak
consider
for
one
other
thing
the
former
condition
of
the
world
it
was
filled
with
diseases
people
were
not
in
any
way
protected
they
were
allowed
to
live
as
they
pleased
consequently
they
all
committed
excesses
and
all
contracted
disease
some
drank
too
much
some
ate
too
much
some
took
no
exercise
some
took
too
little
some
lay
in
bed
too
long
some
went
to
bed
too
late
some
suffered
themselves
to
fall
into
violent
rages
into
remorse
into
despair
some
loved
inordinately
thousands
worked
too
hard
all
ran
after
continually
for
before
one
there
was
dangled
the
hope
of
promotion
before
another
that
of
glory
before
another
that
of
distinction
fame
or
praise
before
another
that
of
wealth
before
another
the
chance
of
retiring
to
rest
and
meditate
during
the
brief
remainder
of
his
life
miserably
short
even
in
its
whole
length
then
diseases
fell
upon
them
and
they
died
we
have
now
prevented
all
new
diseases
though
we
can
not
wholly
cure
those
which
have
so
long
existed
rheumatism
gout
fevers
arise
no
more
though
of
gout
and
other
maladies
there
are
hereditary
cases
and
since
there
are
no
longer
any
old
men
among
us
there
are
none
of
the
maladies
to
which
old
age
is
liable
no
more
pain
no
more
suffering
no
more
anxiety
no
more
death
except
by
accident
in
the
world
yet
some
of
them
would
return
to
the
old
miseries
and
for
what
for
what
you
shall
hear
when
the
chimes
began
the
people
turned
their
faces
with
one
consent
towards
the
public
hall
and
a
smile
of
satisfaction
spread
over
all
their
faces
they
were
going
to
supper
the
principal
event
of
the
day
at
the
same
moment
a
procession
issued
from
the
iron
gates
of
the
college
first
marched
our
warder
or
porter
john
lax
bearing
a
halberd
next
came
an
assistant
carrying
a
cushion
on
which
were
the
keys
of
gold
symbolical
of
the
gate
of
life
then
came
another
bearing
our
banner
with
the
labarum
or
symbol
of
life
the
assistants
followed
in
ancient
garb
of
cap
and
gown
then
came
the
twelve
fellows
or
physicians
of
the
college
in
scarlet
gowns
and
flat
caps
after
them
i
myself
samuel
grout
suffragan
followed
last
there
marched
the
first
person
in
the
realm
none
other
than
the
arch
physician
himself
henry
linister
in
lawn
sleeves
a
black
silk
gown
and
a
scarlet
hood
four
beadles
closed
the
procession
for
with
us
the
only
deviation
from
equality
absolute
is
made
in
the
case
of
the
college
we
are
a
caste
apart
we
keep
mankind
alive
and
free
from
pain
this
is
our
work
this
occupies
all
our
thoughts
we
are
therefore
held
in
honor
and
excused
the
ordinary
work
which
the
others
must
daily
perform
and
behold
the
difference
between
ancient
and
modern
times
for
formerly
those
who
were
held
in
honor
and
had
high
office
in
this
always
sacred
house
were
aged
and
men
who
arrived
at
this
distinction
but
a
year
or
two
before
they
had
to
die
but
we
of
the
holy
college
are
as
stalwart
as
strong
and
as
young
as
any
man
in
the
hall
and
so
have
we
been
for
hundreds
of
years
and
so
we
mean
to
continue
in
the
public
hall
we
take
our
meals
apart
in
our
own
hall
yet
the
food
is
the
same
for
all
life
is
the
common
possession
it
is
maintained
for
all
by
the
same
process
here
must
be
no
difference
let
all
therefore
eat
and
drink
alike
when
i
consider
i
repeat
the
universal
happiness
i
am
carried
away
first
with
a
burning
indignation
that
any
should
be
so
mad
as
to
mar
this
happiness
they
have
failed
but
they
cost
us
as
you
shall
hear
much
trouble
and
caused
the
lamentable
death
of
a
most
zealous
and
able
officer
among
the
last
to
enter
the
gates
were
the
girl
christine
and
her
grandfather
who
walked
slowly
coughing
all
the
way
come
grandad
she
said
as
we
passed
her
take
my
arm
you
will
be
better
after
your
dinner
lean
on
me
there
was
in
her
face
so
remarkable
a
light
that
i
wonder
now
that
no
suspicion
or
distrust
possessed
us
i
call
it
light
for
i
can
compare
it
to
nothing
else
the
easy
comfortable
life
our
people
led
and
the
absence
of
all
exciting
work
the
decay
of
reading
and
the
abandonment
of
art
had
left
their
faces
placid
to
look
upon
but
dull
they
were
certainly
dull
they
moved
heavily
if
they
lifted
their
eyes
they
wanted
the
light
that
flashed
from
christine
it
was
a
childish
face
still
full
of
softness
no
one
would
ever
believe
that
a
creature
so
slight
in
form
so
gentle
to
look
upon
whose
eyes
were
so
soft
whose
cheeks
were
like
the
untouched
bloom
of
a
ripe
peach
whose
lips
were
so
rosy
was
already
harboring
thoughts
so
abominable
and
already
conceiving
an
enterprise
so
wicked
we
do
not
suspect
in
this
our
new
world
as
we
have
no
property
to
defend
no
one
is
a
thief
as
everybody
has
as
much
of
everything
as
he
wants
no
one
tries
to
get
more
we
fear
not
death
and
therefore
need
no
religion
we
have
no
private
ambitions
to
gratify
and
no
private
ends
to
attain
therefore
we
have
long
since
ceased
to
be
suspicious
least
of
all
should
we
have
been
suspicious
of
christine
why
but
a
year
or
two
ago
she
was
a
little
newly
born
babe
whom
the
holy
college
crowded
to
see
as
a
new
thing
and
yet
was
it
possible
that
one
so
young
should
be
so
corrupt
suffragan
said
the
arch
physician
to
me
at
supper
i
begin
to
think
that
your
triumph
of
science
must
be
really
complete
why
physician
because
day
after
day
that
child
leads
the
old
man
by
the
hand
places
him
in
his
seat
and
ministers
after
the
old
forgotten
fashion
to
his
slightest
wants
and
no
one
pays
her
the
slightest
heed
why
should
they
a
child
a
beautiful
child
a
feeble
old
man
one
who
ministers
to
another
suffragan
the
past
is
indeed
far
far
away
but
i
knew
not
until
now
that
it
was
so
utterly
lost
childhood
and
age
and
the
offices
of
love
and
these
things
are
wholly
unheeded
grout
you
are
indeed
a
great
man
he
spoke
in
the
mocking
tone
which
was
usual
with
him
so
that
we
never
knew
exactly
whether
he
was
in
earnest
or
not
but
i
think
that
on
this
occasion
he
was
in
earnest
no
one
but
a
very
great
man
none
smaller
than
samuel
grout
myself
could
have
accomplished
this
miracle
upon
the
minds
of
the
people
they
did
not
minister
one
to
the
other
why
should
they
everybody
could
eat
his
own
ration
without
any
help
offices
of
love
these
to
pass
unheeded
what
did
the
arch
physician
mean
chapter
ii
grout
suffragan
it
always
pleases
me
from
my
place
at
the
college
table
which
is
raised
two
feet
above
the
rest
to
contemplate
the
multitude
whom
it
is
our
duty
and
our
pleasure
to
keep
in
contentment
and
in
health
it
is
a
daily
joy
to
watch
them
flocking
as
you
have
seen
them
flock
to
their
meals
the
heart
glows
to
think
of
what
we
have
done
i
see
the
faces
of
all
light
up
with
satisfaction
at
the
prospect
of
the
food
it
is
the
only
thing
that
moves
them
yes
we
have
reduced
life
to
its
simplest
form
here
is
true
happiness
nothing
to
hope
nothing
to
fear
except
accident
a
little
work
for
the
common
preservation
a
body
of
wise
men
always
devising
measures
for
the
common
good
food
plentiful
and
varied
gardens
for
repose
and
recreation
both
summer
and
winter
warmth
shelter
and
the
entire
absence
of
all
emotions
why
the
very
faces
of
the
people
are
growing
all
alike
one
face
for
the
men
and
another
for
the
women
perhaps
in
the
future
the
face
of
the
man
will
approach
nearer
and
nearer
to
that
of
the
woman
and
so
all
will
be
at
last
exactly
alike
and
the
individual
will
exist
indeed
no
more
then
there
will
be
from
first
to
last
among
the
whole
multitude
neither
distinction
nor
difference
it
is
a
face
which
fills
one
with
contentment
though
it
will
be
many
centuries
before
it
approaches
completeness
it
is
a
smooth
face
there
are
no
lines
in
it
it
is
a
grave
face
the
lips
seldom
smile
and
never
laugh
the
eyes
are
heavy
and
move
slowly
there
has
already
been
achieved
though
the
change
has
been
very
gradual
the
complete
banishment
of
that
expression
which
has
been
preserved
in
every
one
of
the
ancient
portraits
which
may
be
usefully
studied
for
purposes
of
contrast
whatever
the
emotion
attempted
to
be
portrayed
and
even
when
the
face
was
supposed
to
be
at
rest
there
was
always
behind
visible
to
the
eye
an
expression
of
anxiety
or
eagerness
some
kind
of
pain
always
lies
upon
those
old
faces
even
upon
the
youngest
how
could
it
be
otherwise
on
the
morrow
they
would
be
dead
they
had
to
crowd
into
a
few
days
whatever
they
could
grasp
of
life
as
i
sit
there
and
watch
our
people
at
dinner
i
see
with
satisfaction
that
the
old
pain
has
gone
out
of
their
faces
they
have
lived
so
long
that
they
have
forgotten
death
they
live
so
easily
that
they
are
contented
with
life
we
have
reduced
existence
to
the
simplest
they
eat
and
drink
it
is
their
only
pleasure
they
work
it
is
a
necessity
for
health
and
existence
but
their
work
takes
them
no
longer
than
till
noontide
they
lie
in
the
sun
they
sit
in
the
shade
they
sleep
if
they
had
once
any
knowledge
it
is
now
forgotten
their
old
ambitions
their
old
desires
all
are
forgotten
they
sleep
and
eat
they
work
and
rest
to
rest
and
to
eat
are
pleasures
which
they
never
desire
to
end
to
live
forever
to
eat
and
drink
forever
this
is
now
their
only
hope
and
this
has
been
accomplished
for
them
by
the
holy
college
science
has
justified
herself
this
is
the
outcome
of
long
search
for
generations
into
the
secrets
of
nature
we
who
have
carried
on
this
search
have
at
length
succeeded
in
stripping
humanity
of
all
those
things
which
formerly
made
existence
intolerable
to
him
he
lives
he
eats
he
sleeps
perhaps
i
know
not
but
of
this
we
sometimes
talk
in
the
college
i
say
perhaps
we
may
succeed
in
making
some
kind
of
artificial
food
as
we
compound
the
great
arcanum
with
simple
ingredients
and
without
labor
we
may
also
extend
the
duration
of
sleep
we
may
thus
still
further
simplify
existence
man
in
the
end
as
i
propose
to
make
and
mould
the
people
will
sleep
until
nature
calls
upon
him
to
awake
and
eat
he
will
then
eat
drink
and
sleep
again
while
the
years
roll
by
he
will
lie
heedless
of
all
he
will
be
heedless
of
the
seasons
heedless
of
the
centuries
time
will
have
no
meaning
for
him
a
breathing
living
inarticulate
mass
will
be
all
that
is
left
of
the
active
eager
chattering
man
of
the
past
this
may
be
done
in
the
future
when
yonder
laboratory
which
we
call
the
house
of
life
shall
yield
the
secrets
of
nature
deeper
and
deeper
still
at
present
we
have
arrived
at
this
point
the
chief
pleasure
of
life
is
to
eat
and
to
drink
we
have
taught
the
people
so
much
of
all
the
tastes
which
formerly
gratified
man
this
alone
remains
we
provide
them
daily
with
a
sufficiency
and
variety
of
food
there
are
so
many
kinds
of
food
and
the
combinations
are
so
endless
that
practically
the
choice
of
our
cooks
is
unlimited
good
food
varied
food
food
with
drink
also
varied
and
pure
and
the
best
that
can
be
made
make
our
public
meals
a
daily
joy
we
have
learned
to
make
all
kinds
of
wine
from
the
grapes
in
our
it
is
so
abundant
that
every
day
all
the
year
round
the
people
may
call
for
a
ration
of
what
they
please
we
make
also
beer
of
every
kind
cider
perry
and
mead
the
gratification
of
the
sense
of
taste
helps
to
remove
the
incentive
to
restlessness
or
discontent
the
minds
of
most
are
occupied
by
no
other
thought
than
that
of
the
last
feast
and
the
next
if
they
were
to
revolt
where
would
they
find
their
next
meal
at
the
outset
we
had
i
confess
grave
difficulties
there
was
not
in
existence
any
holy
college
we
drifted
without
object
or
purpose
for
a
long
time
the
old
ambitions
remained
the
old
passions
were
continued
the
old
ideas
of
private
property
prevailed
the
old
inequalities
were
kept
up
presently
there
arose
from
those
who
had
no
property
the
demand
for
a
more
equal
share
the
cry
was
fiercely
resisted
then
there
followed
civil
war
for
a
space
till
both
sides
were
horrified
by
the
bloodshed
that
followed
time
also
was
on
the
side
of
them
who
rebelled
i
was
one
because
at
the
time
when
the
whole
nation
was
admitted
to
a
participation
in
the
great
arcanum
i
was
myself
a
young
man
of
nineteen
employed
as
a
washer
of
bottles
in
laboratory
and
therefore
according
to
the
ideas
of
the
time
a
very
humble
person
time
helped
us
in
an
unexpected
way
property
was
in
the
hands
of
single
individuals
formerly
they
died
and
were
succeeded
by
their
sons
now
the
sons
grew
tired
of
waiting
how
much
longer
were
their
fathers
who
grew
no
older
to
keep
all
the
wealth
to
themselves
therefore
the
civil
war
having
come
to
an
end
with
no
result
except
a
barren
peace
the
revolutionary
party
was
presently
joined
by
all
but
the
holders
of
property
and
the
state
took
over
to
itself
the
whole
wealth
that
is
to
say
the
whole
land
there
is
no
other
wealth
since
that
time
there
has
been
no
private
property
for
since
it
was
clearly
unjust
to
take
away
from
the
father
in
order
to
give
it
to
the
son
with
no
limitation
as
to
the
time
of
enjoyment
everything
followed
the
land
great
houses
which
were
allowed
to
fall
into
ruin
pictures
and
works
of
art
libraries
jewels
which
are
in
museums
and
money
which
however
ceased
to
be
of
value
as
soon
as
there
was
nothing
which
could
be
bought
as
for
me
i
was
so
fortunate
as
to
perceive
linister
daily
impressed
it
upon
me
that
of
all
occupations
that
of
physicist
would
very
quickly
become
the
most
important
i
therefore
remained
in
my
employment
worked
read
experimented
and
learned
all
that
my
master
had
to
teach
me
the
other
professions
indeed
fell
into
decay
more
speedily
than
some
of
us
expected
there
could
be
no
more
lawyers
when
there
was
no
more
property
even
libel
which
was
formerly
the
cause
of
many
actions
became
harmless
when
a
man
could
not
be
injured
and
besides
it
is
impossible
to
libel
any
man
when
there
are
no
longer
any
rules
of
conduct
except
the
one
duty
of
work
which
is
done
in
the
eyes
of
all
and
can
not
be
shirked
and
how
could
religion
survive
the
removal
of
death
to
some
possible
remote
future
they
tried
it
is
true
to
keep
up
the
pretence
of
it
and
many
especially
women
clung
to
the
old
forms
of
faith
for
i
know
not
how
long
with
the
great
mass
religion
ceased
to
have
any
influence
as
soon
as
life
was
assured
as
for
art
learning
science
other
than
that
of
physics
biology
and
medicine
all
gradually
decayed
and
died
away
and
the
old
foolish
pursuit
of
literature
which
once
occupied
so
many
and
was
even
held
in
a
kind
of
honor
the
writing
of
histories
poems
dramas
novels
essays
on
human
life
this
also
decayed
and
died
because
men
ceased
to
be
anxious
about
their
past
or
their
future
and
were
at
last
contented
to
dwell
in
the
present
another
and
a
most
important
change
which
may
be
noted
was
the
gradual
decline
and
disappearance
of
the
passion
called
love
this
was
once
a
curious
and
inexplicable
yearning
so
much
is
certain
of
two
young
people
towards
each
other
so
that
they
were
never
content
unless
they
were
together
and
longed
to
live
apart
from
the
rest
of
the
world
each
trying
to
make
the
other
happier
at
least
this
is
as
i
read
history
for
my
own
part
as
i
was
constantly
occupied
with
science
i
never
felt
this
passion
or
if
i
did
then
i
have
quite
forgotten
it
now
at
the
outset
people
who
were
in
love
rejoiced
beyond
measure
that
their
happiness
would
last
so
long
they
began
so
long
as
the
words
had
any
meaning
to
call
each
other
angels
goddesses
divinely
fair
possessed
of
every
perfect
gift
with
other
extravagancies
at
the
mere
recollection
of
which
we
should
now
blush
presently
they
grew
tired
of
each
other
they
no
longer
lived
apart
from
the
rest
of
the
world
they
separated
or
if
they
continued
to
walk
together
it
was
from
force
of
habit
some
still
continue
thus
to
sit
side
by
side
no
new
connections
were
formed
people
ceased
desiring
to
make
others
happy
because
the
state
began
to
provide
for
everybody
happiness
the
whole
essence
of
the
old
society
was
a
fight
everybody
fought
for
existence
everybody
trampled
on
the
weaker
if
a
man
loved
a
woman
he
fought
for
her
as
well
as
for
himself
love
why
when
the
true
principle
of
life
is
recognized
the
right
of
every
individual
to
his
or
her
share
and
that
an
equal
share
in
everything
and
when
the
continuance
of
life
is
assured
what
room
is
there
for
love
the
very
fact
of
the
public
life
the
constant
companionship
the
open
mingling
of
women
with
men
and
this
for
year
after
year
the
same
women
with
the
same
men
has
destroyed
the
mystery
which
formerly
hung
about
womanhood
and
was
in
itself
the
principal
cause
of
love
it
is
gone
therefore
and
with
it
the
most
disturbing
element
of
life
without
love
without
ambition
without
suffering
without
religion
without
quarrelling
without
private
rights
without
rank
or
class
life
is
calm
gentle
undisturbed
therefore
they
all
sit
down
to
dinner
in
peace
and
contentment
every
man
mind
intent
upon
nothing
but
the
bill
of
fare
this
evening
directed
by
the
observation
of
the
arch
physician
i
turned
my
eyes
upon
the
girl
christine
who
sat
beside
her
grandfather
i
observed
first
but
the
fact
inspired
me
with
no
suspicion
that
she
was
no
longer
a
child
but
a
woman
grown
and
i
began
to
wonder
when
she
would
come
with
the
rest
for
the
arcanum
most
women
when
births
were
common
among
us
used
to
come
at
about
that
is
to
say
in
the
first
year
or
two
of
full
womanhood
before
their
worst
enemies
where
there
were
two
women
in
the
old
days
there
were
two
enemies
could
say
that
they
had
begun
to
fall
off
if
you
look
round
our
table
you
will
see
very
few
women
older
than
and
very
few
men
older
than
thirty
there
were
many
women
at
this
table
who
might
perhaps
have
been
called
beautiful
in
the
old
times
though
now
the
men
had
ceased
to
think
of
beauty
and
the
women
had
ceased
to
desire
admiration
yet
if
regular
features
large
eyes
small
mouths
a
great
quantity
of
hair
and
a
rounded
figure
are
beautiful
then
there
were
many
at
the
table
who
might
have
been
called
beautiful
but
the
girl
christine
i
observed
the
fact
with
scientific
interest
was
so
different
from
the
other
women
that
she
seemed
another
kind
of
creature
her
eyes
were
soft
there
is
no
scientific
term
to
express
this
softness
of
youth
one
observes
it
especially
in
the
young
of
the
kind
there
was
also
a
curious
softness
on
her
cheek
as
if
something
would
be
rubbed
away
if
one
touched
it
and
her
voice
differed
from
that
of
her
elder
sisters
it
was
curiously
gentle
and
full
of
that
quality
which
may
be
remarked
in
the
when
she
pairs
in
spring
they
used
to
call
it
tenderness
but
since
the
thing
itself
disappeared
the
word
has
naturally
fallen
out
of
use
now
i
might
have
observed
with
suspicion
whereas
i
only
remarked
it
as
something
strange
that
the
company
among
which
christine
and
the
old
man
sat
were
curiously
stirred
and
uneasy
they
were
disturbed
out
of
their
habitual
tranquillity
because
the
girl
was
discoursing
to
them
she
was
telling
them
what
she
had
learned
about
the
past
oh
i
heard
her
say
it
was
a
beautiful
time
why
did
they
ever
suffer
it
to
perish
do
you
mean
that
you
actually
remember
nothing
of
it
they
looked
at
each
other
sheepishly
there
were
soldiers
men
were
soldiers
they
went
out
to
fight
with
bands
of
music
and
the
shouts
of
the
people
there
were
whole
armies
of
soldiers
thousands
of
them
they
dressed
in
beautiful
glittering
clothes
do
you
forget
that
one
of
the
men
murmured
hazily
that
there
were
soldiers
and
there
were
sailors
who
went
upon
the
sea
in
great
ships
jack
carera
she
turned
to
one
of
them
you
are
a
sailor
too
you
ought
to
remember
i
remember
the
sailors
very
well
indeed
said
this
young
man
readily
i
always
had
my
doubts
about
the
wisdom
of
admitting
our
sailors
among
the
people
we
have
a
few
ships
for
the
carriage
of
those
things
which
as
yet
we
have
not
succeeded
in
growing
for
ourselves
these
are
manned
by
a
few
hundred
sailors
who
long
ago
volunteered
and
have
gone
on
ever
since
they
are
a
brave
race
ready
to
face
the
most
terrible
dangers
of
tempest
and
shipwreck
but
they
are
also
a
dangerous
restless
talkative
questioning
tribe
they
have
in
fact
preserved
almost
as
much
independence
as
the
college
itself
they
are
now
confined
to
their
own
port
of
sheerness
then
the
girl
began
to
tell
some
pestilent
story
of
love
and
shipwreck
and
rescue
and
at
hearing
it
some
of
them
looked
puzzled
and
some
pained
but
the
sailor
listened
with
all
his
ears
where
did
you
get
that
from
christine
where
i
get
everything
from
the
old
library
come
and
read
it
in
the
book
jack
i
am
not
much
hand
at
reading
but
some
day
perhaps
after
next
voyage
christine
the
girl
poured
out
a
glass
of
claret
for
the
old
man
then
she
went
on
telling
them
stories
but
most
of
her
neighbors
seemed
neither
to
hear
nor
to
comprehend
only
the
listened
and
nodded
then
she
laughed
out
loud
at
this
sound
so
strange
so
unexpected
everybody
within
hearing
jumped
her
table
was
in
the
hall
next
to
our
own
so
that
we
heard
the
laugh
quite
plainly
the
arch
physician
looked
round
approvingly
how
many
years
since
we
heard
a
good
honest
laugh
suffragan
give
us
more
children
and
soften
our
hearts
for
us
but
no
the
heart
you
want
is
the
hard
crusted
selfish
heart
see
no
one
asks
why
she
laughed
they
are
all
eating
again
now
just
as
if
nothing
had
happened
happy
enviable
people
presently
he
turned
to
me
and
remarked
in
his
lofty
manner
as
if
he
was
above
all
the
world
you
can
not
explain
suffragan
why
at
an
unexpected
touch
a
sound
a
voice
a
trifle
the
memory
may
be
suddenly
awakened
to
things
long
long
past
and
forgotten
do
you
know
what
that
laugh
caused
me
to
remember
i
can
not
explain
why
nor
can
you
it
recalled
the
evening
of
the
great
discovery
not
the
discovery
itself
but
quite
another
thing
i
went
there
more
to
meet
a
girl
than
to
hear
what
the
german
had
to
say
as
to
that
i
expected
very
little
to
meet
that
girl
seemed
of
far
more
importance
i
meant
to
make
love
to
her
love
suffragan
a
thing
which
you
can
never
understand
real
genuine
love
i
meant
to
marry
her
well
i
did
meet
her
and
i
arranged
for
a
convenient
place
where
we
could
meet
again
after
the
lecture
then
came
the
discovery
and
i
was
carried
away
body
and
soul
and
forgot
the
girl
and
love
and
everything
in
the
stupefaction
of
this
most
wonderful
discovery
of
which
we
have
made
between
us
such
admirable
use
you
never
knew
whether
the
arch
physician
was
in
earnest
or
not
truly
we
had
made
a
most
beautiful
use
of
the
discovery
but
it
was
not
in
the
way
that
linister
would
have
chosen
all
this
remembered
just
because
a
girl
laughed
suffragan
science
can
not
explain
all
i
shall
never
pretend
to
deny
that
linister
powers
as
a
physicist
were
of
the
first
order
nor
that
his
discoveries
warranted
his
election
to
the
headship
of
the
college
yet
something
was
due
perhaps
to
his
tall
and
commanding
figure
and
to
the
look
of
authority
which
reigned
naturally
on
his
face
and
to
the
way
in
which
he
always
stepped
into
the
first
rank
he
was
always
the
chief
long
before
the
college
of
physicians
assumed
the
whole
authority
in
everything
that
he
joined
he
opposed
the
extinction
of
property
and
would
have
had
everybody
win
what
he
could
and
keep
it
as
long
as
he
would
he
opposed
the
massacre
of
the
old
he
was
opposed
in
short
to
the
majority
of
the
college
yet
he
was
our
chief
his
voice
was
clear
and
what
he
said
always
produced
its
effect
though
it
did
not
upset
my
solid
majority
or
thwart
the
grand
advance
of
the
triumph
of
science
as
for
me
my
position
has
been
won
by
sheer
work
and
merit
my
figure
is
not
commanding
i
am
and
my
voice
is
rough
and
as
for
manners
i
have
nothing
to
do
with
them
but
in
science
there
is
but
one
second
to
linister
and
that
is
grout
when
the
supper
came
to
an
end
we
rose
and
marched
back
to
the
college
in
the
same
state
and
order
with
which
we
had
arrived
as
for
the
people
some
of
them
went
out
into
the
garden
some
remained
in
the
hall
it
was
then
nine
and
twilight
some
went
straight
to
their
own
rooms
where
they
would
smoke
tobacco
an
old
habit
allowed
by
the
college
on
account
of
its
soothing
and
sedative
influence
before
going
to
bed
by
ten
everybody
would
be
in
bed
and
asleep
what
more
beautiful
proof
of
the
advance
of
science
than
the
fact
that
the
whole
of
the
thousand
people
who
formed
the
population
of
canterbury
dropped
off
to
sleep
the
moment
they
laid
their
heads
upon
the
pillow
this
it
is
to
have
learned
the
proper
quantities
and
kinds
of
food
the
proper
amount
of
bodily
exercise
and
work
and
the
complete
subjugation
of
all
the
ancient
forces
of
unrest
and
disquiet
to
be
sure
we
were
all
with
one
or
two
exceptions
in
the
very
prime
and
flower
of
early
manhood
and
womanhood
it
would
be
hard
indeed
if
a
young
man
of
thirty
should
not
sleep
well
i
was
presently
joined
in
the
garden
of
the
college
by
the
arch
physician
grout
he
said
let
us
sit
and
talk
my
mind
is
disturbed
it
is
always
disturbed
when
the
memory
of
the
past
is
forced
upon
me
the
evil
past
i
said
if
you
please
the
evil
past
the
question
is
whether
it
was
not
infinitely
more
tolerable
for
mankind
than
the
evil
present
we
argued
out
the
point
but
it
was
one
on
which
we
could
never
agree
for
he
remained
saturated
with
the
old
ideas
of
private
property
and
individualism
he
maintained
that
there
are
no
rights
of
man
at
all
except
his
right
to
what
he
can
get
and
what
he
can
keep
he
even
went
so
far
as
to
say
that
the
true
use
of
the
great
discovery
should
have
been
to
cause
the
incompetent
the
idle
the
hereditarily
corrupt
and
the
vicious
to
die
painlessly
as
to
those
who
were
left
he
said
i
would
have
taught
them
the
selfishness
of
staying
too
long
when
they
had
taken
time
for
work
and
play
and
society
and
love
they
should
have
been
exhorted
to
go
away
of
their
own
accord
and
to
make
room
for
their
children
then
we
should
have
had
always
the
due
succession
of
father
and
son
mother
and
daughter
always
age
and
manhood
and
childhood
and
always
the
world
advancing
by
the
efforts
of
those
who
would
have
time
to
work
for
an
appreciable
period
instead
we
have
he
waved
his
hand
i
was
going
to
reply
when
suddenly
a
voice
light
clear
and
sweet
broke
upon
our
astonished
ears
was
the
voice
of
a
woman
and
she
was
singing
at
first
i
hardly
listened
because
i
knew
that
it
could
be
none
other
than
the
child
christine
whom
indeed
i
had
often
heard
singing
it
is
natural
i
believe
for
children
to
sing
but
the
arch
physician
listened
first
with
wonder
and
then
with
every
sign
of
amazement
how
could
he
be
concerned
by
the
voice
of
a
child
singing
silly
verses
then
i
heard
the
last
lines
of
her
song
which
she
sang
i
admit
with
great
vigor
oh
love
is
worth
the
whole
broad
earth
oh
love
is
worth
the
whole
broad
earth
give
that
you
give
us
all
grout
cried
the
arch
physician
in
tones
of
the
deepest
agitation
i
choke
i
am
stifled
listen
they
are
words
that
i
wrote
i
myself
wrote
with
my
own
hand
long
long
ago
in
the
past
i
wrote
them
for
a
girl
the
girl
i
told
you
of
at
dinner
i
loved
her
i
thought
never
again
to
feel
as
i
felt
then
yet
the
memory
of
that
feeling
has
come
back
to
me
is
it
possible
can
some
things
never
die
can
we
administer
no
drug
that
will
destroy
memory
for
the
earth
reeled
beneath
my
feet
again
and
my
senses
reeled
and
i
would
once
more
yes
i
would
once
more
have
given
all
the
world
yes
life
even
life
only
to
call
that
woman
mine
for
a
year
a
month
a
day
an
hour
the
arch
physician
made
this
astonishing
confession
in
a
broken
and
agitated
voice
then
he
rushed
away
and
left
me
alone
in
the
the
singer
could
certainly
have
been
none
other
than
the
girl
christine
how
should
she
get
hold
of
linister
strange
she
had
disturbed
our
peace
at
supper
by
laughing
and
she
had
agitated
the
arch
physician
himself
to
such
a
degree
as
i
should
have
believed
impossible
by
singing
a
foolish
old
song
when
i
went
to
bed
there
came
into
my
mind
some
of
the
old
idle
talk
about
witches
and
i
even
dreamed
that
we
were
burning
a
witch
who
was
filling
our
minds
with
disturbing
thoughts
chapter
iii
christine
at
home
when
the
girl
christine
walked
through
the
loitering
crowd
outside
the
hall
some
of
the
people
looked
after
her
with
wondering
eyes
strange
said
a
woman
she
laughed
she
laughed
ay
said
another
we
have
forgotten
how
to
laugh
but
we
used
to
laugh
before
she
broke
off
with
a
sigh
and
she
sings
said
a
third
i
have
heard
her
sing
like
a
lark
in
the
museum
once
said
the
first
woman
we
used
to
sing
as
well
as
laugh
i
remember
we
used
to
sing
she
makes
us
remember
the
old
days
the
bad
old
days
it
was
one
of
the
assistant
physicians
who
admonished
her
the
times
when
nothing
was
certain
not
even
life
from
day
to
day
it
should
bring
you
increased
happiness
to
think
sometimes
of
those
old
times
the
first
woman
who
had
spoken
was
one
whom
men
would
have
called
beautiful
in
those
old
times
when
their
heads
were
turned
by
such
a
thing
as
a
woman
face
she
was
pale
of
cheek
and
had
black
eyes
which
in
those
days
of
passion
and
jealousy
might
have
flashed
like
lightning
now
they
were
dull
she
was
shapely
of
limb
and
figure
too
with
an
ample
cheek
and
a
full
mouth
formerly
in
the
days
of
love
and
rage
those
limbs
would
have
been
lithe
and
active
now
they
were
heavy
and
slow
heaviness
of
movement
and
of
eyes
sensibly
grows
upon
our
people
i
welcome
every
indication
of
advance
towards
the
perfect
type
of
humanity
which
will
do
nothing
but
lie
down
breathe
eat
and
sleep
yes
she
replied
with
a
deep
sigh
nothing
was
certain
the
bad
old
times
when
people
died
but
there
was
love
and
we
danced
and
sung
and
laughed
she
sighed
again
and
walked
away
alone
slowly
hanging
her
head
the
girl
passed
through
them
leading
the
old
man
by
the
hand
i
know
very
well
now
that
we
ought
to
have
been
suspicious
what
meant
the
gleam
and
sparkle
of
her
eyes
when
all
other
eyes
were
dull
what
meant
the
parting
of
her
lips
and
the
smile
which
always
lay
upon
them
when
no
one
else
smiled
at
all
why
did
she
carry
her
head
erect
when
the
rest
walked
with
hanging
heads
why
again
did
she
sing
when
no
one
else
sang
why
did
she
move
as
if
her
limbs
were
on
springs
when
all
the
rest
went
slowly
and
heavily
these
signs
meant
mischief
i
took
them
for
the
natural
accompaniments
of
youth
they
meant
more
than
youth
they
meant
dangerous
curiosity
they
meant
presently
purpose
how
should
one
of
the
people
dare
to
have
a
purpose
unknown
to
the
sacred
college
you
shall
hear
all
that
followed
was
in
fact
due
to
our
own
blindness
we
should
long
before
have
shut
up
every
avenue
which
might
lead
the
curious
to
the
study
of
the
past
we
should
have
closed
the
museum
and
the
library
altogether
we
did
not
because
we
lived
in
the
supposition
that
the
more
the
old
times
were
investigated
the
more
the
people
would
be
satisfied
with
the
present
when
indeed
one
looks
at
the
pictures
of
battle
murder
cruelty
and
all
kinds
of
passion
when
one
reads
the
old
books
full
of
foolishness
which
can
only
be
excused
on
the
plea
of
a
life
too
short
to
have
a
right
comprehension
of
anything
it
is
amazing
that
the
scene
does
not
strike
the
observer
with
a
kind
of
horror
when
which
is
seldom
i
carry
my
own
memory
back
to
the
old
times
and
see
myself
before
i
went
to
the
laboratory
to
a
brewery
ordered
here
and
there
working
all
day
long
with
no
other
prospect
than
to
be
a
servant
for
a
short
span
of
life
and
then
to
die
when
i
remember
the
people
among
whom
i
lived
poor
starving
dependent
from
day
to
day
on
the
chance
of
work
or
at
best
from
week
to
week
when
i
think
of
the
misery
from
which
these
poor
people
have
been
rescued
i
can
not
find
within
me
a
spark
of
sympathy
for
the
misguided
wretches
who
voluntarily
exchanged
their
calm
and
happy
present
for
the
tumult
and
anxiety
of
the
past
however
we
are
not
all
reasonable
as
you
shall
hear
it
was
already
twilight
outside
and
in
the
museum
there
was
only
light
enough
to
see
that
a
few
persons
were
assembled
in
the
great
hall
christine
placed
her
grandfather
in
a
wooden
chair
in
which
he
spent
most
of
his
time
clutching
at
the
arms
and
fighting
with
his
asthma
then
she
turned
up
the
electric
light
it
showed
a
large
rather
lofty
room
oblong
in
shape
old
arms
were
arranged
round
the
walls
great
stood
about
filled
with
a
collection
of
all
kinds
of
things
preserved
from
the
old
times
there
were
illustrations
of
their
arts
now
entirely
useless
such
as
the
jewels
they
wore
set
in
bracelets
and
necklaces
their
gloves
fans
rings
umbrellas
pictures
and
statuary
then
there
were
cases
filled
with
the
old
implements
of
writing
paper
inkstands
pens
and
so
forth
the
people
have
long
since
left
off
writing
there
were
boxes
full
of
coins
with
which
they
bought
things
and
for
which
they
sold
their
freedom
there
were
things
with
which
they
played
games
many
of
them
dangerous
ones
and
whiled
away
the
tedium
of
their
short
lives
there
were
models
of
the
ships
in
which
they
went
to
sea
also
models
of
all
kinds
of
engines
and
machines
which
slaves
they
were
nearly
all
slaves
made
for
the
purpose
of
getting
more
money
for
their
masters
there
were
also
crowns
coronets
and
mitres
which
formerly
belonged
to
people
who
possessed
what
they
called
rank
there
were
the
which
were
formerly
used
every
day
in
great
buildings
like
the
house
of
life
there
were
specimens
of
legal
documents
on
parchment
by
the
drawing
up
of
which
when
law
existed
a
great
many
people
procured
a
contemptible
existence
there
were
also
models
with
figures
of
the
people
in
them
of
parliament
houses
churches
and
courts
of
justice
there
were
models
of
soldiers
in
uniform
when
men
were
of
understanding
so
contemptible
as
to
be
tempted
to
risk
life
even
life
in
exchange
for
a
coat
but
then
our
ancestors
were
indescribably
foolish
there
were
musical
instruments
of
all
kinds
i
have
always
been
glad
that
music
fell
so
soon
into
disuse
it
is
impossible
to
cultivate
contentment
while
music
is
practised
besides
the
ordinary
weapons
sword
pike
and
javelin
there
were
all
kinds
of
horrible
inventions
such
as
vast
cannons
torpedo
boats
dynamite
shells
and
so
forth
for
the
destruction
of
towns
ships
and
armor
it
is
a
great
and
splendid
collection
but
it
ought
to
have
been
long
long
before
transferred
to
the
custody
of
the
holy
college
the
girl
looked
inquiringly
at
her
visitors
counting
them
all
there
were
ten
namely
five
men
and
five
women
like
all
the
people
they
were
young
the
men
about
thirty
the
women
about
or
the
men
were
dressed
in
their
blue
flannels
with
a
flat
cap
of
the
same
material
the
women
in
their
gray
beige
short
frock
the
flat
gray
cap
under
which
their
hair
was
gathered
gray
stockings
and
heavy
shoes
the
dress
was
in
fact
invented
by
myself
for
both
sexes
it
has
many
advantages
first
there
is
always
plenty
of
the
stuff
to
be
had
next
both
flannel
and
beige
are
soft
warm
and
healthy
textures
with
such
a
dress
there
is
no
possibility
of
distinction
or
of
superiority
and
lastly
with
such
a
dress
the
women
have
lost
all
power
of
setting
forth
their
attractions
so
as
to
charm
the
men
with
new
fashions
crafty
subtleties
of
dress
provocations
of
the
troublesome
passion
of
love
in
the
shape
of
jewels
ribbons
gloves
and
the
like
no
one
wears
gloves
all
the
women
hands
are
hard
and
although
they
are
still
young
and
their
faces
are
unchanged
their
eyes
are
dull
and
hard
i
am
pleased
to
think
that
there
is
no
more
foolishness
of
love
among
us
the
people
were
standing
or
sitting
about
not
together
but
separately
each
by
himself
or
herself
this
tendency
to
solitary
habits
is
a
most
healthy
indication
of
the
advance
of
humanity
is
the
first
law
separate
and
solitary
existence
is
the
last
condition
of
mankind
they
were
silent
and
regardless
of
each
other
their
attitude
showed
the
listlessness
of
their
minds
i
am
glad
you
are
here
said
christine
you
promised
you
would
not
fail
me
and
yet
though
you
promised
i
feared
that
at
the
last
moment
you
might
change
your
mind
i
was
afraid
that
you
would
rather
not
be
disturbed
in
the
even
current
of
your
thoughts
why
disturb
our
minds
asked
one
a
woman
we
were
at
peace
before
you
began
to
talk
of
the
past
we
had
almost
forgotten
it
and
it
is
so
long
ago
her
voice
sank
to
a
murmur
so
long
ago
they
all
echoed
it
is
so
long
ago
so
long
ago
oh
cried
the
girl
you
call
this
to
be
at
peace
why
if
you
were
so
many
stones
in
the
garden
you
could
not
be
more
truly
at
peace
to
work
to
rest
to
eat
to
sleep
you
call
that
life
and
yet
you
can
remember
if
you
please
the
time
when
you
were
full
of
activity
and
hope
if
to
remember
is
to
regret
why
should
we
invite
the
pain
of
regret
we
can
not
have
the
old
life
except
with
the
old
conditions
the
short
life
and
the
if
i
could
remember
if
i
had
ever
belonged
to
the
past
the
girl
interrupted
quickly
oh
i
would
remember
every
moment
i
would
live
every
day
of
the
old
life
over
and
over
again
but
i
can
do
nothing
nothing
but
read
of
the
splendid
past
and
look
forward
to
such
a
future
as
your
own
alas
why
was
i
born
at
all
since
i
was
born
into
such
a
world
as
this
why
was
i
called
into
existence
when
all
the
things
of
which
i
read
every
day
have
passed
away
and
what
remains
in
their
place
we
have
life
said
one
of
the
men
but
not
confidently
life
yes
and
what
a
life
oh
what
a
life
well
we
waste
time
listen
now
and
if
you
can
for
once
forget
the
present
and
recall
the
past
do
not
stay
to
think
how
great
a
gulf
lies
between
do
not
count
the
years
indeed
you
can
not
whether
they
are
one
hundred
or
five
hundred
they
do
not
know
even
at
the
holy
college
itself
i
am
sure
it
will
make
you
happier
console
and
comfort
you
in
this
our
life
of
desperate
monotony
only
to
remember
to
recall
how
you
used
to
live
they
answered
with
a
look
of
blank
bewilderment
it
is
so
long
ago
so
long
ago
said
one
of
them
again
look
around
you
here
are
all
the
things
that
used
to
be
your
own
let
them
help
you
to
remember
here
are
the
arms
that
the
men
carried
when
they
went
out
to
fight
here
are
the
jewels
that
the
women
wore
think
of
your
dress
in
the
days
when
you
were
allowed
to
dress
and
we
did
not
all
wear
frocks
of
gray
beige
as
if
all
women
were
exactly
alike
will
that
not
help
they
looked
about
them
helplessly
no
they
did
not
yet
remember
their
dull
eyes
were
filled
with
a
kind
of
anxious
wonder
as
might
be
seen
in
one
rudely
awakened
out
of
sleep
they
looked
at
the
things
in
the
great
room
but
that
seemed
to
bring
nothing
back
to
their
minds
the
present
was
round
them
like
a
net
which
they
could
neither
cut
through
nor
see
through
it
was
a
veil
around
them
through
which
they
could
not
pass
it
had
been
so
long
with
them
it
was
so
unchanging
for
so
long
they
had
had
nothing
to
expect
for
so
long
therefore
they
had
not
cared
to
look
back
the
holy
college
had
produced
in
fact
what
it
had
proposed
and
designed
the
minds
of
the
people
had
become
quiescent
and
to
think
that
so
beautiful
a
state
of
things
should
be
destroyed
by
a
girl
the
only
child
in
the
community
will
it
help
said
the
girl
if
we
turn
down
the
light
a
little
so
now
we
are
almost
in
darkness
but
for
the
moonlight
through
the
window
in
the
old
times
when
you
were
children
i
have
read
that
you
loved
to
sit
together
and
to
tell
stories
let
us
tell
each
other
stories
nobody
replied
but
the
young
man
called
jack
took
christine
hand
and
held
it
let
us
try
said
the
girl
again
i
will
tell
you
a
story
long
ago
there
were
people
called
gentlefolk
grandad
here
was
a
gentleman
i
have
read
about
them
in
the
old
books
i
wonder
if
any
of
you
remember
those
people
they
were
exempt
from
work
the
lower
sort
worked
for
them
they
led
a
life
of
ease
they
made
their
own
work
for
themselves
some
of
the
men
fought
for
their
country
it
was
in
the
old
time
you
know
when
men
still
fought
some
worked
for
their
country
some
worked
for
the
welfare
of
those
who
worked
for
bread
some
only
amused
themselves
some
were
profligates
and
did
wicked
things
she
paused
no
one
responded
the
women
had
no
work
to
do
at
all
they
only
occupied
themselves
in
making
everybody
happy
they
were
treated
with
the
greatest
respect
they
were
not
allowed
to
do
anything
at
all
that
could
be
done
for
them
they
played
and
sang
they
painted
and
embroidered
they
knew
foreign
languages
they
constantly
inspired
the
men
to
do
great
things
even
if
they
should
be
killed
here
all
shuddered
and
trembled
christine
made
haste
to
change
the
subject
they
wore
beautiful
dresses
think
dresses
of
silk
and
satin
embroidered
with
gold
trimmed
with
lace
they
had
necklaces
bracelets
and
rings
their
hands
were
white
and
they
wore
long
gloves
to
their
elbows
they
dressed
their
hair
as
they
pleased
some
wore
it
long
like
this
she
pulled
off
her
flat
cap
and
threw
back
her
long
tresses
and
quickly
turned
up
the
light
she
was
transformed
the
women
started
and
gasped
take
off
your
caps
she
ordered
they
obeyed
and
at
sight
of
the
flowing
locks
that
fell
upon
their
shoulders
curling
rippling
flowing
their
eyes
brightened
but
only
for
a
moment
yes
said
the
girl
they
wore
their
beautiful
hair
as
they
pleased
oh
she
gathered
in
her
hands
the
flowing
tresses
of
one
you
have
such
long
and
beautiful
hair
it
is
a
shame
it
is
a
shame
to
hide
it
think
of
the
lovely
dresses
to
match
this
beauty
of
the
hair
oh
cried
the
women
we
remember
the
dresses
we
remember
them
now
why
make
us
remember
them
it
is
so
long
ago
so
long
ago
and
we
can
never
wear
them
any
more
nay
but
you
have
the
same
beauty
said
christine
that
at
least
remains
you
have
preserved
your
youth
and
your
beauty
of
what
good
are
our
faces
to
us
said
another
woman
with
such
a
dress
as
this
men
no
longer
look
upon
our
beauty
let
us
be
said
the
woman
who
had
spoken
first
there
can
be
no
change
for
us
why
disturb
our
minds
the
present
is
horrible
but
we
have
ceased
to
care
much
for
anything
we
do
our
day
work
every
day
all
the
same
hours
of
work
we
wear
the
same
dress
to
every
woman
the
same
dress
we
eat
and
drink
the
same
food
to
every
one
the
same
we
are
happy
because
we
have
got
all
we
can
get
and
we
expect
no
more
we
never
talk
why
should
we
talk
when
you
laughed
it
was
like
an
earthquake
her
words
were
strong
but
her
manner
of
speech
was
a
monotone
this
way
of
speaking
grows
upon
us
it
is
the
easiest
i
watch
the
indications
with
interest
from
rapid
talk
to
slow
talk
from
animated
talk
to
monotony
the
next
step
will
be
to
silence
absolute
there
is
no
change
for
us
she
repeated
neither
in
summer
nor
in
winter
we
have
preserved
our
youth
but
we
have
lost
all
the
things
which
the
youthful
used
to
desire
we
thought
to
preserve
our
beauty
what
is
the
good
of
beauty
with
such
a
dress
and
such
a
life
why
should
we
make
ourselves
miserable
in
remembering
any
of
the
things
we
used
to
desire
oh
cried
the
girl
clasping
her
hands
to
me
there
is
no
pleasure
possible
but
in
learning
all
about
the
past
i
read
the
old
books
i
look
at
the
old
pictures
i
play
the
old
music
i
sing
the
old
songs
but
it
is
not
enough
i
know
how
you
were
dressed
not
all
alike
in
gray
beige
frocks
but
in
lovely
silk
and
beautiful
embroidered
stuffs
i
will
show
you
presently
how
you
dressed
i
know
how
you
danced
and
played
games
and
acted
most
beautiful
plays
and
i
have
read
stories
about
you
i
know
that
you
were
always
dissatisfied
and
wanting
something
or
other
the
stories
are
full
of
discontent
nobody
ever
sits
down
satisfied
except
one
pair
there
is
always
one
pair
and
they
fall
in
love
in
love
she
repeated
what
is
that
i
wonder
then
she
went
on
again
they
only
want
one
thing
then
and
the
are
all
about
how
they
got
it
after
wonderful
adventures
there
are
no
adventures
now
the
books
tell
us
all
this
but
i
want
more
i
want
to
know
more
i
want
to
see
the
old
stories
with
my
own
eyes
i
want
to
see
you
in
your
old
dresses
talking
in
your
own
old
way
the
books
can
not
tell
me
how
you
talked
and
how
you
looked
i
am
sure
it
was
not
as
you
talk
now
because
you
never
talk
there
is
no
reason
why
we
should
talk
all
the
old
desires
have
ceased
to
be
we
no
longer
want
anything
or
expect
anything
come
i
shall
do
my
best
to
bring
the
past
back
to
you
first
i
have
learned
who
you
were
that
is
why
i
have
called
you
together
in
the
old
times
you
all
belonged
to
gentlefolk
this
announcement
produced
no
effect
at
all
they
listened
with
looks
they
had
entirely
forgotten
that
there
were
ever
such
distinctions
as
gentle
and
simple
you
will
remember
presently
said
christine
not
discouraged
i
have
found
out
in
the
ancient
rolls
your
names
and
your
families
names
and
families
said
one
of
the
men
are
gone
long
ago
christine
what
is
the
good
of
reviving
the
memory
of
things
that
can
never
be
restored
but
the
man
named
jack
carera
the
sailor
of
whom
i
have
already
spoken
stepped
forward
i
have
said
that
the
sailors
were
a
dangerous
class
on
account
of
their
independence
and
their
good
meaning
tell
us
he
said
about
our
families
why
i
for
one
have
never
forgotten
that
i
was
once
a
gentleman
it
is
hard
to
tell
now
because
they
have
made
us
all
alike
but
for
many
many
years
i
know
not
how
many
we
who
had
been
gentlemen
consorted
together
you
shall
again
said
christine
if
you
please
listen
then
first
my
grandfather
he
was
called
sir
arthur
farrance
and
he
was
called
a
baronet
to
be
a
baronet
was
in
those
days
something
greatly
desired
by
many
people
a
man
in
the
old
books
was
said
to
enjoy
the
title
of
baronet
but
i
know
not
why
one
man
was
so
raised
above
another
heugh
heugh
heugh
coughed
the
old
man
i
remember
that
why
what
is
there
to
remember
except
the
old
times
i
was
a
baronet
the
fifth
baronet
my
country
place
was
in
sussex
and
my
town
address
was
white
and
the
travellers
yes
christine
nodded
my
grandfather
memory
is
tenacious
he
forgets
nothing
of
the
things
that
happened
when
he
was
young
i
have
learned
a
great
deal
from
him
he
seems
to
have
known
all
your
grandmothers
for
instance
and
speaks
of
them
as
if
he
had
loved
them
all
i
did
i
did
said
the
old
man
i
loved
them
every
one
the
girl
turned
to
the
women
before
her
the
women
all
in
the
gray
dresses
exactly
alike
but
their
gray
flat
caps
had
been
thrown
off
and
they
looked
disturbed
moved
out
of
the
common
languor
now
i
will
tell
you
who
you
were
formerly
you
she
pointed
to
the
nearest
were
the
lady
mildred
carera
only
daughter
of
the
earl
of
thordis√°
your
father
and
mother
survived
the
discovery
but
were
killed
in
the
great
massacre
year
when
nearly
all
the
old
were
put
to
death
you
were
a
great
beauty
in
your
time
and
when
the
discovery
was
announced
you
were
in
your
second
season
people
wondered
who
would
win
you
but
those
who
pretended
to
know
talked
of
a
young
scientific
professor
the
woman
heard
as
if
she
was
trying
to
understand
a
foreign
language
this
was
in
fact
a
language
without
meaning
to
her
as
yet
she
caught
nothing
you
said
christine
turning
to
the
next
were
dorothy
oliphant
you
were
also
young
beautiful
and
an
heiress
you
like
lady
mildred
had
all
the
men
at
your
feet
i
do
know
what
that
means
but
the
books
say
so
then
the
discovery
came
and
whatever
that
was
seems
to
have
gone
out
of
fashion
the
second
woman
heard
this
information
with
eyes
what
did
it
matter
you
christine
turned
to
a
third
and
to
a
fourth
and
fifth
you
were
rosie
lorrayne
you
adela
dupr√©
you
susie
campbell
you
were
all
in
society
you
were
all
young
and
beautiful
and
happy
now
for
the
men
she
turned
to
them
the
sailor
named
jack
gazed
upon
her
with
eyes
of
admiration
the
other
men
startled
at
first
by
the
apparition
of
the
tresses
had
relapsed
into
listlessness
they
hardly
looked
up
as
she
addressed
them
first
she
pointed
to
the
sailor
your
name
i
remember
my
name
he
said
i
have
not
forgotten
so
much
as
our
friends
sailors
talk
more
with
each
other
and
remember
i
am
named
john
carera
and
i
was
formerly
to
lady
mildred
cousin
he
held
out
his
hand
have
you
forgotten
your
cousin
we
used
to
play
together
in
the
old
times
you
promised
to
marry
me
when
you
should
grow
up
lady
mildred
gave
him
her
hand
it
is
so
long
ago
so
long
ago
she
murmured
but
her
eyes
were
troubled
she
had
begun
to
remember
the
things
put
away
and
forgotten
for
so
long
you
christine
turned
to
another
were
geoffrey
heron
you
were
captain
in
a
cavalry
regiment
you
will
remember
that
presently
and
a
great
deal
more
you
she
turned
to
another
were
laurence
de
heyn
and
you
were
a
young
lawyer
intending
to
be
a
judge
you
will
remember
that
in
time
you
she
turned
to
another
were
jack
culliford
and
you
were
a
private
secretary
intending
to
go
into
parliament
and
to
rise
perhaps
to
be
prime
minister
and
you
she
turned
to
the
last
were
arnold
buckland
already
a
poet
of
society
you
will
all
remember
these
things
before
long
lastly
you
all
belonged
to
the
people
who
were
born
rich
and
never
used
to
have
any
care
or
anxiety
about
their
daily
bread
nor
did
you
ever
do
any
work
unless
you
chose
it
is
so
long
ago
said
lady
mildred
her
face
was
brighter
now
that
we
have
forgotten
even
that
there
ever
were
gentlefolk
it
is
not
strange
said
christine
that
you
should
have
forgotten
it
why
should
you
remember
anything
we
are
only
a
herd
one
with
another
one
not
greater
and
one
not
less
than
another
now
that
you
know
your
names
again
and
remember
clearly
because
i
have
told
you
she
repeated
the
information
for
fear
they
should
again
forget
who
and
what
you
were
each
of
you
you
will
go
on
to
remember
more
oh
what
good
what
good
asked
lady
mildred
because
it
will
rouse
you
from
your
lethargy
said
the
girl
impetuously
oh
you
sit
in
silence
day
after
day
you
walk
alone
you
ought
to
be
together
as
you
used
to
be
talking
playing
see
i
have
read
the
books
your
lives
were
full
of
excitement
it
makes
my
heart
beat
only
to
read
how
the
men
went
out
to
fight
daring
everything
for
the
sake
of
the
women
they
loved
the
men
love
us
no
longer
said
lady
mildred
if
the
brave
men
fell
but
here
all
faces
except
the
sailor
turned
pale
and
they
shuddered
christine
did
not
finish
the
sentence
she
too
shuddered
in
the
old
times
i
remember
how
being
then
in
the
brewery
i
used
to
listen
in
the
whitechapel
road
to
the
men
who
every
sunday
morning
and
evening
used
to
tell
us
that
religion
was
a
mockery
and
a
snare
invented
by
the
priests
for
their
own
selfish
ends
so
that
they
might
be
kept
in
sloth
and
at
their
ease
there
was
no
need
now
for
these
orators
the
old
religion
was
clean
dead
and
forgotten
when
men
ceased
to
expect
death
what
need
was
there
to
keep
up
any
interest
in
the
future
world
if
there
should
be
any
but
the
bare
mention
of
the
dreadful
thing
is
still
enough
to
make
all
cheeks
turn
pale
every
year
the
farther
off
death
recedes
the
more
terrible
he
looks
therefore
they
all
shuddered
among
the
musical
instruments
in
the
museum
there
stands
one
a
square
wooden
box
on
legs
with
wires
inside
it
there
are
many
other
musical
instruments
the
use
of
all
as
i
thought
forgotten
very
soon
after
the
great
discovery
people
ceased
to
care
for
music
for
my
own
part
i
have
never
been
able
to
understand
how
the
touching
of
chords
and
the
striking
of
hammers
on
wires
can
produce
any
effect
at
all
upon
the
mind
except
that
of
irritation
we
preserve
trumpets
for
the
processions
of
the
college
because
mere
noise
awes
people
and
because
trumpets
make
more
noise
with
less
trouble
than
the
human
voice
but
with
music
such
as
it
used
to
be
we
have
now
nothing
to
do
at
all
i
have
been
told
that
people
were
formerly
greatly
moved
by
music
so
that
every
kind
of
emotion
was
produced
in
their
minds
merely
by
listening
to
a
man
or
woman
playing
some
instrument
it
must
have
been
so
because
christine
merely
by
playing
the
old
music
to
the
company
was
able
to
bring
back
their
minds
to
the
past
but
it
must
be
remembered
that
she
had
disturbed
their
minds
first
she
sat
down
then
before
this
box
and
she
began
to
play
upon
it
watching
the
people
meanwhile
she
played
the
music
of
their
own
time
indeed
there
has
been
none
written
since
it
was
a
kind
of
witchery
first
the
sailor
named
jack
sprang
to
his
feet
and
began
to
walk
up
and
down
the
room
with
wild
gestures
and
strange
looks
then
the
rest
one
by
one
grew
restless
they
looked
about
them
they
left
their
chairs
and
began
to
look
at
each
other
and
at
the
things
in
the
cases
the
past
was
coming
slowly
into
sight
i
have
heard
how
men
at
sea
perceive
an
island
far
away
but
like
a
cloud
on
the
horizon
how
the
cloud
grows
larger
and
assumes
outline
how
this
grows
clearer
and
larger
still
until
before
the
ship
reaches
the
harbor
and
drops
her
anchor
the
cliffs
and
the
woods
and
even
the
single
trees
on
the
are
clearly
visible
thus
the
listeners
gradually
began
to
see
the
past
again
now
to
feel
these
old
times
again
one
must
go
back
to
them
and
become
once
more
part
of
them
it
is
possible
because
we
are
still
of
the
age
when
we
left
them
therefore
this
little
company
who
had
left
the
old
time
when
they
were
still
young
began
to
look
again
as
they
had
then
looked
their
eyes
brightened
their
cheeks
flushed
their
limbs
became
elastic
their
heads
were
thrown
back
the
faces
of
the
women
grew
soft
and
those
of
the
men
strong
on
all
alike
there
fell
once
more
the
look
of
restless
expectancy
and
of
unsatisfied
yearning
which
belonged
to
all
ages
in
the
old
time
presently
they
began
to
murmur
i
know
not
what
and
then
to
whisper
to
each
other
with
gentle
sighs
then
the
girls
they
were
really
girls
again
caught
each
other
by
the
hand
and
panted
and
sighed
again
and
at
last
they
fell
upon
each
other
necks
and
kissed
as
for
the
men
they
now
stood
erect
and
firm
but
for
the
most
part
they
gazed
upon
the
girls
with
wonder
and
admiration
unspeakable
so
great
was
the
power
of
witchery
possessed
by
this
insignificant
girl
christine
looked
on
and
laughed
gently
then
she
suddenly
changed
her
music
and
began
to
play
a
march
loud
and
triumphant
and
as
she
played
she
spoke
when
the
brave
soldiers
came
home
from
battle
and
from
victory
it
was
right
that
the
people
should
all
go
forth
to
meet
them
the
music
played
for
them
the
children
strewed
roses
under
their
feet
the
bells
were
set
ringing
the
crowds
cheered
them
the
women
wept
and
laughed
at
the
same
time
and
waved
them
welcome
nothing
could
be
too
good
for
the
men
who
fought
for
their
country
listen
i
found
the
song
of
the
victors
return
in
an
old
book
i
wonder
if
you
remember
it
i
think
it
is
a
very
simple
little
thing
then
she
sang
she
had
a
strong
clear
voice
they
had
heard
her
singing
before
no
one
sang
in
the
whole
city
except
this
child
and
already
it
had
been
observed
that
her
singing
made
men
restless
i
do
not
deny
the
fulness
and
richness
of
her
voice
but
the
words
she
sang
linister
words
they
were
are
mere
foolishness
with
flying
flag
with
beat
of
drum
oh
brave
and
gallant
show
in
rags
and
tatters
home
they
come
we
love
them
better
so
with
sunburnt
cheeks
and
wounds
and
scars
yet
still
their
swords
are
bright
oh
welcome
welcome
from
the
wars
brave
lads
who
fought
the
fight
the
girls
they
laugh
the
girls
they
cry
shall
their
guerdon
be
alas
that
some
must
fall
and
die
bring
forth
our
gauds
to
see
all
too
slight
give
what
we
might
up
spoke
a
soldier
tall
love
is
worth
the
whole
broad
earth
oh
love
is
worth
the
whole
broad
earth
give
that
you
give
us
all
do
you
remember
the
song
christine
asked
they
shook
their
heads
yet
it
seemed
familiar
they
remembered
some
such
songs
geoffrey
heron
said
the
girl
turning
to
one
of
the
men
you
were
captain
heron
in
the
old
days
you
remember
that
you
were
in
the
army
was
i
he
started
no
yes
i
remember
i
was
captain
heron
we
rode
out
of
portsmouth
dockyard
gates
when
we
came
home
all
that
were
left
of
us
the
women
were
waiting
on
the
hard
outside
and
they
laughed
and
cried
and
caught
our
hands
and
ran
beside
the
horses
our
ranks
were
thin
for
we
had
been
pretty
well
knocked
about
i
remember
now
yes
yes
i
was
i
was
captain
heron
go
into
that
room
you
will
find
your
old
uniform
take
off
the
blue
flannels
and
show
us
how
you
looked
when
you
were
in
uniform
as
if
it
was
nothing
at
all
unusual
the
man
rose
and
obeyed
it
was
observed
that
he
now
carried
himself
differently
he
stood
erect
with
shoulders
squared
head
up
and
limbs
straight
they
all
obeyed
whatever
this
girl
ordered
them
to
do
christine
began
to
play
again
she
played
another
march
but
always
loud
and
triumphant
when
the
soldier
came
back
he
was
dressed
in
the
uniform
which
he
had
worn
in
the
time
of
the
great
discovery
when
they
left
off
taking
account
of
time
oh
cried
christine
springing
to
her
feet
see
see
here
is
a
soldier
here
is
a
man
who
has
fought
he
stood
before
them
dressed
in
a
scarlet
tunic
and
a
white
helmet
a
red
sash
hung
across
him
and
on
his
breast
were
medals
at
sight
of
him
the
girl
called
dorothy
oliphant
changed
countenance
all
caught
their
breath
the
aspect
of
the
man
carried
them
indeed
back
to
the
old
old
time
welcome
home
captain
heron
said
christine
we
have
followed
your
campaign
day
by
day
we
are
home
again
the
soldier
replied
gravely
unfortunately
we
have
left
a
good
many
of
our
regiment
behind
behind
you
mean
they
are
dead
christine
shuddered
the
others
shuddered
even
captain
heron
himself
for
a
moment
turned
pale
but
he
was
again
in
the
past
and
the
honor
of
his
regiment
was
in
his
hands
you
have
fought
with
other
men
said
christine
let
me
look
in
your
face
yes
it
is
changed
you
have
the
look
of
the
fighting
man
in
the
old
pictures
you
look
as
if
you
mean
to
have
something
whatever
it
is
whether
other
men
want
it
or
not
oh
you
have
fought
with
men
it
is
wonderful
perhaps
you
have
even
killed
men
were
you
dreadfully
afraid
captain
heron
started
and
flushed
afraid
he
asked
afraid
oh
christine
clapped
her
hands
i
wanted
to
see
that
look
it
is
the
look
of
a
man
in
sudden
wrath
forgive
me
it
is
terrible
to
see
a
man
thus
moved
no
captain
heron
no
i
understand
an
officer
in
your
regiment
could
be
afraid
of
nothing
she
sat
down
still
looking
at
him
i
have
seen
a
soldier
she
said
then
she
sprang
to
her
feet
now
she
cried
it
is
our
turn
come
with
me
you
ladies
and
you
gentlemen
go
into
that
room
for
one
night
we
will
put
on
the
dresses
you
used
to
wear
come
they
obeyed
there
was
nothing
that
they
would
not
have
done
so
completely
had
she
bewitched
them
how
long
since
they
had
been
addressed
as
ladies
and
gentlemen
come
she
said
in
the
room
whither
she
led
the
women
look
about
and
choose
what
you
please
but
we
must
make
haste
there
was
a
great
pile
of
dainty
dresses
laid
out
for
them
to
choose
dresses
in
silk
and
all
kinds
of
delicate
stuffs
with
embroidery
lace
ribbons
jewels
chains
rings
bracelets
gloves
fans
shoes
everything
that
the
folly
of
the
past
time
required
to
make
rich
women
seem
as
if
they
were
not
the
same
as
their
poorer
sisters
they
turned
over
the
dresses
and
cried
out
with
admiration
then
they
hastened
to
tear
off
their
ugly
gray
frocks
and
began
to
dress
but
the
girl
called
dorothy
oliphant
sank
into
a
chair
oh
he
has
forgotten
me
he
has
forgotten
me
who
am
i
that
he
should
remember
me
after
all
these
years
why
said
christine
how
should
he
remember
what
matters
that
you
have
the
same
face
think
of
your
dull
look
and
your
heavy
eyes
think
of
the
dowdy
dress
and
the
ugly
cap
wait
till
you
have
put
on
a
pretty
frock
and
have
dressed
your
hair
here
is
a
chain
of
pearls
which
will
look
pretty
in
your
hair
here
is
a
sweet
colored
silk
i
am
sure
it
will
fit
you
oh
it
is
a
shame
it
is
a
shame
that
we
have
to
dress
so
never
mind
now
i
have
found
out
the
old
dresses
we
will
have
many
evenings
together
we
will
go
back
to
the
past
he
will
remember
you
dorothy
dear
oh
how
could
you
give
them
up
how
you
give
up
your
lovely
dresses
we
were
made
to
give
them
up
because
there
were
not
enough
beautiful
dresses
to
go
round
they
said
that
no
woman
must
be
dressed
better
than
another
so
they
invented
it
was
grout
the
suffragan
who
did
it
the
gray
dress
for
the
women
and
the
blue
flannel
for
the
men
and
i
had
almost
forgotten
that
there
were
such
things
christine
my
head
is
swimming
my
heart
is
beating
i
have
not
felt
my
heart
beating
for
i
know
not
how
long
oh
will
geoffrey
remember
me
when
i
am
dressed
quick
of
course
he
will
let
me
dress
you
oh
i
often
come
here
in
the
daytime
and
dress
up
and
pretend
that
it
is
the
past
again
you
shall
come
with
me
but
i
want
to
hear
you
talk
as
you
used
to
talk
and
to
see
you
dance
as
you
used
to
dance
then
i
shall
understand
it
all
when
they
returned
the
men
were
waiting
for
them
their
blue
flannels
were
exchanged
for
black
cloth
clothes
which
it
had
been
the
custom
of
those
who
called
themselves
gentlemen
to
wear
in
the
evening
in
ancient
times
this
was
their
absurd
custom
kept
up
in
order
to
mark
the
difference
between
a
gentleman
and
one
of
the
lower
class
if
you
had
no
you
were
not
a
gentleman
how
could
men
ever
tolerate
for
a
single
day
the
existence
of
such
a
social
difference
as
for
me
in
the
part
of
london
where
i
lived
called
whitechapel
there
were
no
the
change
however
seemed
to
have
transformed
them
their
faces
had
an
eager
look
as
if
they
wanted
something
of
course
in
the
old
times
everybody
always
wanted
something
you
can
see
it
in
the
pictures
the
faces
are
never
at
rest
in
the
portraits
the
eyes
are
always
seeking
for
something
nowhere
is
there
visible
the
least
sign
of
contentment
these
unfortunate
men
had
acquired
with
their
old
clothes
something
of
the
old
restlessness
christine
laughed
aloud
and
clapped
her
hands
the
women
did
not
laugh
they
saluted
the
men
who
bowed
with
a
certain
coldness
the
manners
of
the
past
were
coming
back
to
them
swiftly
but
the
old
ease
was
not
recovered
for
the
first
quarter
of
an
hour
then
captain
heron
who
had
changed
his
uniform
for
civilian
dress
suddenly
flushed
and
stepped
forward
whispering
dorothy
you
have
forgotten
me
dorothy
smiled
softly
and
gave
him
her
hand
with
a
quick
sigh
no
she
had
not
forgotten
him
dance
said
christine
i
want
to
see
you
dance
i
will
play
for
you
she
played
a
piece
of
music
called
a
waltz
when
this
kind
of
music
used
to
be
played
i
mean
in
the
houses
of
ladies
not
those
of
the
people
the
young
men
and
women
caught
each
other
round
the
waist
and
twirled
round
they
had
many
foolish
customs
but
none
more
foolish
i
should
suppose
than
this
i
have
never
seen
the
thing
done
because
all
this
foolishness
was
forgotten
as
soon
as
we
settled
down
to
the
enjoyment
of
the
great
discovery
when
therefore
christine
began
this
music
they
looked
at
each
other
for
a
few
moments
and
then
inspired
by
memory
they
fell
into
each
other
arms
and
began
their
dance
she
played
for
them
for
a
quarter
of
an
hour
while
the
rest
danced
the
young
man
jack
stood
beside
the
piano
as
if
he
was
chained
to
the
spot
she
had
bewitched
them
all
but
none
so
much
as
this
man
he
therefore
gazed
upon
the
girl
with
an
admiration
which
certainly
belonged
to
the
old
time
indeed
i
have
never
been
able
to
understand
how
the
past
could
be
so
suddenly
assumed
to
admire
actually
to
admire
a
woman
knowing
all
the
time
it
is
impossible
to
conceal
the
fact
that
she
is
your
inferior
that
she
is
inferior
in
strength
and
intellect
well
i
have
already
called
them
unfortunate
men
i
can
say
no
more
how
can
people
admire
things
below
themselves
when
she
had
played
for
a
quarter
of
an
hour
or
so
this
young
man
called
upon
her
to
stop
the
dancers
stopped
too
panting
their
eyes
full
of
light
their
cheeks
flushed
and
their
lips
parted
oh
dorothy
sighed
i
never
thought
to
feel
such
happiness
again
i
could
dance
on
forever
with
me
murmured
geoffrey
i
was
praying
that
the
last
round
might
never
stop
with
me
with
you
she
whispered
come
cried
the
young
man
jack
it
is
too
bad
christine
must
dance
play
for
us
cousin
mildred
and
i
will
give
her
a
lesson
mildred
laughed
then
she
started
at
the
unwonted
sound
the
others
laughed
to
hear
it
and
the
walls
of
the
museum
echoed
with
the
laughter
of
girls
the
old
man
sat
up
in
his
chair
and
looked
around
i
thought
i
was
at
philippe
in
paris
he
said
i
thought
we
were
having
a
supper
after
the
theatre
there
was
ninette
and
there
was
madeleine
and
and
he
looked
about
him
bewildered
then
he
dropped
his
head
and
went
to
sleep
again
when
he
was
neither
eating
nor
battling
for
his
breath
he
was
always
sleeping
i
am
your
cousin
jack
said
mildred
but
i
had
long
forgotten
it
and
as
for
playing
but
i
will
try
perhaps
the
old
touch
will
return
it
did
she
played
with
far
greater
skill
and
power
than
the
christine
but
not
as
they
have
said
since
with
greater
sweetness
then
jack
took
christine
and
gave
her
a
first
lesson
it
lasted
nearly
half
an
hour
oh
cried
the
girl
when
lady
mildred
stopped
i
feel
as
if
i
had
been
floating
round
in
a
dream
was
i
a
stupid
pupil
jack
you
were
the
aptest
pupil
that
ever
had
i
know
now
she
said
with
panting
breath
and
flushed
cheeks
what
dancing
means
it
is
wonderful
that
the
feet
should
answer
to
the
music
surely
you
must
have
loved
dancing
we
did
the
girls
replied
we
did
there
was
no
greater
pleasure
in
the
world
why
did
you
give
it
up
they
looked
at
each
other
after
the
great
discovery
said
dorothy
oliphant
we
were
so
happy
to
get
rid
of
the
terrors
of
old
age
and
the
loss
of
our
beauty
and
everything
that
at
first
we
thought
of
nothing
else
when
we
tried
to
dance
again
something
had
gone
out
of
it
the
men
were
not
the
same
perhaps
we
were
not
the
same
everything
languished
after
that
there
was
no
longer
any
enjoyment
we
ceased
to
dance
because
we
found
no
pleasure
in
dancing
but
now
you
do
said
christine
we
do
because
you
have
filled
our
hearts
with
the
old
thoughts
to
get
out
of
the
dull
dull
round
why
is
it
that
we
never
felt
it
dull
till
oh
so
long
as
we
can
remember
the
old
thoughts
let
us
continue
to
dance
and
to
play
and
to
sing
if
the
old
thoughts
cease
to
come
back
to
us
she
looked
at
geoffrey
let
us
fall
back
into
our
dulness
like
the
men
and
women
round
us
it
was
to
please
me
first
said
christine
you
were
so
very
kind
as
to
come
here
to
please
me
because
i
can
have
no
recollection
at
all
of
the
past
and
i
was
curious
to
understand
what
i
read
come
again
to
please
yourselves
oh
i
have
learned
so
much
so
very
much
more
than
i
ever
expected
there
are
so
many
many
things
that
i
did
not
dream
of
but
let
us
always
dance
she
said
let
us
always
dance
let
me
always
feel
every
time
you
come
as
if
there
was
nothing
in
the
world
but
sweet
music
calling
me
and
i
was
spinning
round
and
round
but
always
in
some
place
far
better
and
sweeter
than
this
yes
lady
mildred
said
gravely
thus
it
was
we
used
to
feel
and
i
have
seen
you
as
you
were
gentlemen
and
gentlewomen
together
oh
it
is
beautiful
come
every
night
let
us
never
cease
to
change
the
dismal
present
for
the
sunny
past
but
there
is
one
thing
one
thing
that
i
can
not
understand
what
is
that
asked
lady
mildred
in
the
old
books
there
is
always
as
i
said
before
a
young
man
in
love
with
a
girl
what
is
it
love
the
girls
sighed
and
cast
down
their
eyes
was
it
possible
for
a
man
so
to
love
a
girl
as
to
desire
nothing
in
the
world
but
to
have
her
love
and
even
to
throw
away
his
life
actually
his
very
life
his
very
life
for
her
sake
dorothy
said
geoffrey
taking
both
her
hands
was
it
possible
oh
was
it
possible
dorothy
burst
into
tears
it
possible
she
cried
but
oh
it
is
not
possible
any
longer
let
us
pretend
said
geoffrey
let
us
dream
that
it
is
possible
even
to
throw
away
your
life
to
die
actually
your
life
asked
christine
to
die
to
exist
no
longer
to
abandon
life
for
the
sake
of
another
person
a
sudden
change
passed
over
all
their
faces
the
light
died
out
of
their
eyes
the
smile
died
on
their
lips
the
softness
vanished
from
the
ladies
faces
the
men
hung
their
heads
all
their
gallantry
left
them
and
geoffrey
let
mildred
hands
slip
from
his
holding
the
thought
of
death
brought
them
all
back
to
the
present
no
said
lady
mildred
sadly
and
with
changed
voice
such
things
are
no
longer
possible
formerly
men
despised
death
because
it
was
certain
to
come
in
a
few
years
at
best
and
why
not
therefore
but
we
can
not
brave
death
any
more
we
live
each
for
himself
that
is
the
only
safety
there
is
only
the
law
of
all
are
alike
we
can
not
love
each
other
any
more
because
we
are
all
alike
no
woman
is
better
than
another
in
any
eyes
because
we
are
all
dressed
the
same
and
we
are
all
the
same
what
more
do
we
want
she
said
harshly
there
is
no
change
for
us
we
go
from
bed
to
work
from
work
to
rest
and
food
and
so
to
bed
again
what
more
can
we
want
we
are
all
equals
we
are
all
the
same
there
are
no
more
gentlewomen
let
us
put
on
our
gray
frocks
and
our
flat
caps
again
and
hide
our
hair
and
go
home
to
bed
yes
yes
cried
christine
but
you
will
come
again
you
will
come
again
and
we
will
make
every
night
a
play
and
pretence
of
the
beautiful
the
lovely
past
when
we
lay
aside
the
gray
frocks
and
let
down
our
hair
we
shall
go
back
to
the
old
time
the
dear
old
time
the
young
man
named
jack
remained
behind
when
the
others
were
gone
if
it
were
possible
he
said
for
a
man
to
give
up
everything
even
his
life
for
a
woman
in
the
old
times
when
life
was
a
rich
and
glorious
possession
how
much
more
ought
he
not
to
be
willing
to
lay
it
down
now
that
it
has
been
made
a
worthless
weed
i
have
never
felt
so
happy
the
girl
was
thinking
of
something
else
i
have
never
dreamed
that
i
could
feel
so
happy
now
i
know
what
i
have
always
longed
for
to
dance
round
and
round
forever
forgetting
all
but
the
joy
of
the
music
and
the
dance
but
oh
jack
her
face
turned
pale
again
how
could
they
ever
have
been
happy
even
while
they
waltzed
knowing
that
every
minute
brought
them
nearer
and
nearer
to
the
dreadful
end
i
do
know
christine
if
i
were
you
i
would
never
mention
that
ugly
topic
again
except
when
we
are
not
dressed
up
and
acting
how
lovely
they
looked
all
of
them
but
none
of
them
to
compare
with
the
sweetest
of
the
garden
he
took
her
hand
and
kissed
it
and
then
left
her
alone
with
the
old
man
in
the
great
museum
chapter
iv
what
is
love
it
would
be
idle
to
dwell
upon
the
repetition
of
such
scenes
as
those
described
in
the
last
chapter
these
unhappy
persons
continued
to
meet
day
after
day
in
the
museum
after
changing
their
lawful
garments
for
the
fantastic
habits
worn
before
the
great
discovery
they
lost
themselves
nightly
in
the
imagination
of
the
past
they
presently
found
others
among
the
people
who
had
also
been
gentlewomen
and
gentlemen
in
the
old
days
and
brought
them
also
into
the
company
so
that
there
were
now
every
evening
some
thirty
gathered
together
nay
they
even
procured
food
and
made
suppers
for
themselves
contrary
to
the
practice
of
common
meals
enjoined
by
the
holy
college
they
gloried
in
being
a
company
apart
from
the
rest
and
because
they
remembered
the
past
they
had
the
audacity
to
give
themselves
but
only
among
themselves
airs
of
superiority
in
the
daytime
they
wore
the
common
dress
and
were
like
the
rest
of
the
people
the
thing
grew
however
every
evening
they
recalled
more
of
the
customs
and
modes
of
thought
one
remembering
this
and
the
other
that
little
detail
until
almost
every
particular
of
the
ancient
life
had
returned
to
them
then
a
strange
thing
happened
for
though
the
present
offered
still
and
this
they
never
denied
its
calm
unchanging
face
with
no
disasters
to
trouble
and
no
certain
and
miserable
end
to
dread
with
no
anxieties
cares
and
miseries
with
no
ambitions
and
no
struggles
they
fell
to
yearning
after
the
old
things
they
grew
to
loathe
the
present
they
could
hardly
sit
with
patience
in
the
public
hall
they
went
to
their
work
with
disgust
yet
so
apathetic
had
the
people
grown
that
nothing
of
this
was
observed
so
careless
and
so
unsuspicious
were
we
ourselves
that
though
the
singing
and
playing
grew
louder
and
continued
longer
every
evening
none
of
us
suspected
anything
singing
in
my
ears
was
no
more
than
an
unmeaning
noise
that
the
girl
in
the
museum
should
sing
and
play
seemed
foolish
but
then
children
are
foolish
they
like
to
make
a
great
noise
one
afternoon
it
was
some
weeks
since
this
dangerous
fooling
began
the
cause
of
the
whole
the
girl
christine
was
in
the
museum
alone
she
had
a
book
in
her
hand
and
was
reading
in
it
first
she
read
a
few
lines
and
then
paused
and
meditated
a
while
then
she
read
again
and
laughed
gently
to
herself
and
then
she
read
and
changed
color
and
again
she
read
and
knitted
her
brows
as
one
who
considers
but
can
not
understand
the
place
was
quite
deserted
save
for
her
grandfather
who
sat
in
his
great
chair
propped
up
with
pillows
and
fast
asleep
he
had
passed
a
bad
night
with
his
miserable
asthma
in
the
morning
as
often
happens
with
this
disease
he
found
himself
able
to
breathe
again
and
was
now
therefore
taking
a
good
spell
of
sleep
his
long
white
hair
fell
down
upon
his
shoulders
his
wrinkled
old
cheek
showed
a
thousand
feet
and
lines
innumerable
he
looked
a
very
very
old
man
yet
he
was
no
more
than
or
so
in
the
language
of
the
past
he
belonged
formerly
to
those
who
lived
upon
the
labor
of
others
and
devoured
their
substance
now
but
for
his
asthma
which
even
the
college
can
not
cure
he
should
have
been
as
perfectly
happy
as
the
rest
of
the
people
the
sunshine
which
warmed
his
old
limbs
fell
full
upon
his
chair
so
that
he
seemed
of
all
the
rare
and
curious
objects
in
that
collection
the
rarest
and
most
curious
the
old
armor
on
the
wall
the
trophies
of
arms
the
glass
vases
containing
all
the
things
of
the
past
were
not
so
rare
and
curious
as
this
old
man
the
only
old
man
left
among
us
i
daily
for
my
own
part
contemplated
the
old
man
with
a
singular
satisfaction
he
was
i
thought
a
standing
lesson
to
the
people
one
daily
set
before
their
eyes
here
was
the
sole
surviving
specimen
of
what
in
the
past
was
the
best
that
the
men
and
women
could
expect
namely
to
be
spared
until
the
age
of
and
then
to
linger
on
afflicted
with
miserable
diseases
and
slowly
or
swiftly
to
be
tortured
to
death
beholding
that
spectacle
i
argued
all
the
people
ought
to
rub
their
hands
in
complacency
and
gratitude
but
our
people
had
long
ceased
to
reason
or
reflect
the
lesson
was
consequently
thrown
away
upon
them
nay
when
this
girl
began
her
destructive
career
those
whom
she
dragged
into
her
toils
only
considered
this
old
man
because
he
would
still
be
talking
as
all
old
men
used
to
talk
about
the
days
of
his
youth
for
the
purpose
of
increasing
their
knowledge
of
the
past
and
filling
their
foolish
souls
with
yearning
after
the
bad
old
times
while
christine
read
and
pondered
the
door
of
the
museum
opened
the
young
man
called
jack
stood
there
gazing
upon
her
she
had
thrown
off
her
cap
and
her
long
brown
curls
lay
over
her
shoulders
she
had
a
red
rose
in
the
bosom
of
her
gray
dress
and
she
had
tied
a
crimson
scarf
round
her
waist
jack
suffer
me
to
use
the
foolishness
of
their
language
of
course
his
name
was
john
closed
the
door
silently
christine
he
whispered
she
started
and
let
her
book
fall
then
she
gave
him
her
hand
which
he
raised
to
his
lips
again
i
must
ask
leave
to
report
a
great
deal
of
foolishness
it
is
the
sweet
old
fashion
he
said
it
is
my
homage
to
my
lady
they
were
now
so
far
gone
in
folly
that
she
accepted
this
act
as
if
it
was
one
natural
and
becoming
i
have
been
reading
she
said
a
book
full
of
extracts
all
about
love
i
have
never
understood
what
love
is
if
i
ask
dorothy
she
looks
at
geoffrey
heron
and
sighs
if
i
ask
him
he
tells
me
that
he
can
not
be
my
servant
to
teach
me
because
he
is
already
sworn
to
another
what
does
this
mean
have
the
old
times
come
back
again
so
that
men
once
more
call
themselves
slaves
of
love
yet
what
does
it
mean
tell
me
said
jack
what
you
have
been
reading
listen
then
oh
it
is
the
strangest
extravagance
what
did
men
mean
when
they
could
gravely
write
down
and
expect
to
be
read
such
things
as
do
love
you
more
than
words
can
wield
the
matter
dearer
than
eyesight
space
and
liberty
beyond
what
can
be
valued
rich
or
rare
than
eyesight
space
and
liberty
did
they
really
mean
that
they
meant
more
they
meant
dearer
than
life
itself
said
jack
slowly
only
it
was
stupid
always
to
say
the
same
thing
well
then
listen
to
this
i
no
eyes
but
ears
my
ears
would
love
that
inward
beauty
and
invisible
or
were
i
deaf
thy
outward
parts
would
move
each
part
in
me
that
were
but
sensible
though
neither
eyes
nor
ears
to
hear
nor
see
yet
should
i
be
in
love
by
touching
thee
now
jack
what
can
that
mean
was
anything
more
absurd
read
another
extract
christine
here
is
a
passage
more
difficult
than
any
other
looks
not
with
the
eyes
but
with
the
mind
and
therefore
is
wing
cupid
painted
blind
nor
hath
love
mind
of
any
judgment
taste
wings
and
no
eyes
figure
unheedy
haste
and
therefore
is
love
said
to
be
a
child
because
in
choice
he
is
so
oft
beguiled
tell
me
if
you
can
what
this
means
but
perhaps
you
were
never
in
love
jack
in
the
old
times
romeo
was
in
love
before
he
met
juliet
said
jack
i
too
have
been
reading
the
old
books
you
see
child
i
remember
but
how
can
i
tell
you
i
can
not
speak
like
the
poet
yet
i
remember
i
remember
he
looked
round
the
room
it
is
only
here
he
murmured
that
one
can
clearly
remember
here
are
the
very
things
which
used
to
surround
our
daily
life
and
here
are
youth
and
age
they
were
always
with
us
in
the
old
time
youth
and
age
youth
with
love
before
and
age
with
love
behind
always
we
knew
that
as
that
old
man
so
should
we
become
the
chief
joys
of
life
belonged
to
youth
we
knew
very
well
that
unless
we
snatched
them
then
we
should
never
have
them
to
age
we
gave
respect
because
age
we
thought
had
wisdom
but
to
us
to
us
who
were
young
age
cried
unceasingly
ye
while
ye
may
if
i
could
tell
only
you
christine
come
with
me
into
the
picture
gallery
my
words
are
weak
but
the
poets
and
the
painters
speak
for
us
come
we
shall
find
something
there
that
will
speak
for
me
what
i
have
not
words
to
say
for
myself
nothing
in
the
whole
world
i
have
maintained
this
in
the
college
over
and
over
again
has
done
so
much
harm
to
humanity
as
art
in
a
world
of
which
deals
with
nothing
but
fact
and
actuality
art
can
have
no
place
why
imitate
what
we
see
around
us
artists
cheated
the
world
they
pretended
to
imitate
and
they
distorted
or
they
exaggerated
they
put
a
light
into
the
sky
that
never
was
there
they
filled
the
human
face
with
yearning
after
things
impossible
they
put
thoughts
into
the
heart
which
had
no
business
there
they
made
woman
into
a
goddess
and
made
love
simple
love
a
form
of
worship
they
exaggerated
every
joy
they
created
a
heaven
which
could
not
exist
i
have
seen
their
pictures
and
i
know
it
why
why
did
we
not
destroy
all
works
of
art
long
ago
or
at
least
why
did
we
not
enclose
the
gallery
with
the
museum
within
the
college
wall
the
picture
gallery
is
a
long
room
with
ancient
stone
walls
statuary
is
arranged
along
the
central
line
and
the
pictures
line
the
walls
the
young
man
led
the
girl
into
the
gallery
and
looked
around
him
presently
he
stopped
at
a
figure
in
white
marble
it
represented
a
woman
hands
clasped
gazing
upward
anatomically
i
must
say
the
figure
is
fairly
correct
see
he
said
when
in
the
olden
times
our
sculptors
desired
to
depict
the
higher
life
which
we
have
lost
or
thrown
away
for
a
while
they
carved
the
marble
image
of
a
woman
her
form
represented
perfect
beauty
her
face
represented
perfect
purity
the
perfect
soul
must
be
wedded
to
the
perfect
body
otherwise
there
can
be
no
perfection
of
humanity
this
is
the
ideal
woman
look
in
her
face
look
at
the
curves
of
her
form
look
at
the
carriage
of
her
head
such
a
woman
it
was
whom
men
used
to
love
but
were
women
once
like
this
could
they
look
so
had
they
such
sweet
and
tender
faces
this
figure
makes
me
ashamed
when
men
were
in
love
christine
the
woman
that
each
man
loved
became
in
his
mind
such
as
this
he
worshipped
in
his
mistress
the
highest
form
of
life
that
he
could
conceive
some
men
were
gross
their
ideals
were
low
some
were
noble
then
their
ideals
were
high
always
there
were
among
mankind
some
men
who
were
continually
trying
to
raise
the
ideal
always
the
mass
of
men
were
keeping
the
ideal
low
were
the
women
ashamed
to
receive
such
worship
because
they
must
have
known
what
they
were
in
cold
reality
perhaps
to
the
nobler
sort
said
the
young
man
to
be
thought
so
good
lifted
up
their
hearts
and
kept
them
at
that
high
level
but
indeed
i
know
not
remember
that
when
men
wrote
the
words
that
you
think
extravagant
they
were
filled
and
wholly
possessed
with
the
image
of
the
perfect
woman
nay
the
nobler
and
stronger
their
nature
the
more
they
were
filled
with
that
vision
the
deeper
their
love
for
any
woman
the
higher
they
placed
her
on
the
altar
of
their
worship
and
if
another
man
should
try
to
take
that
woman
from
them
they
would
kill
that
other
man
said
jack
with
a
fierce
gleam
in
his
eye
which
made
the
girl
shudder
yet
she
respected
him
for
it
if
another
man
should
come
between
us
now
christine
i
would
nay
dear
forgive
my
rude
words
what
has
jealousy
to
do
with
you
she
dropped
her
eyes
and
blushed
and
in
all
her
limbs
she
trembled
this
young
man
made
her
afraid
and
yet
she
knew
not
why
it
made
her
happy
only
to
be
afraid
of
him
let
us
see
some
of
the
pictures
said
jack
there
were
many
hundreds
of
them
they
represented
i
know
not
what
scenes
of
the
old
life
in
the
old
time
i
dare
say
everything
was
there
with
all
the
exaggerations
which
pleased
the
painters
and
cheated
the
senses
of
those
who
looked
on
fair
women
were
painted
fairer
than
women
could
ever
be
their
eyes
were
larger
softer
fuller
of
thought
their
cheeks
more
tender
their
limbs
more
comely
there
were
battle
scenes
the
young
man
led
the
girl
past
them
there
were
scenes
from
history
kings
laying
down
crowns
traitors
receiving
sentence
and
so
forth
he
passed
them
by
there
were
groups
of
nymphs
portraits
of
fair
women
groups
of
girls
dancing
girls
at
play
girls
laughing
girls
bathing
he
passed
them
by
presently
he
stopped
before
three
panels
side
by
side
representing
a
simple
allegory
of
the
old
time
in
the
first
picture
two
a
young
man
and
a
girl
walked
beside
a
stream
the
water
danced
and
rippled
in
the
sunlight
behind
them
was
an
orchard
full
of
blossom
flowers
sprang
up
at
their
feet
the
flowers
of
spring
and
they
walked
gazing
in
each
other
eyes
the
second
picture
showed
a
man
in
returning
home
from
work
beside
him
walked
his
boys
in
the
porch
the
mother
sat
with
her
daughters
spinning
at
the
wheel
the
stream
was
now
a
full
majestic
river
the
trees
were
loaded
with
fruit
not
yet
ripe
the
fields
were
covered
with
corn
green
still
but
waving
with
light
and
shade
under
the
summer
sky
in
the
distance
passing
away
was
a
heavy
in
the
third
panel
an
old
pair
stood
beside
a
great
river
looking
out
upon
the
ocean
again
they
were
the
sun
was
setting
in
great
splendor
across
the
sea
the
reapers
were
carrying
their
harvest
home
with
songs
and
dances
and
the
old
people
still
gazed
in
each
other
face
just
as
they
had
done
fifty
years
ago
see
christine
said
jack
in
the
first
panel
this
pair
think
of
nothing
but
of
each
other
presently
they
will
have
other
thoughts
the
stream
beside
which
they
wander
is
the
stream
of
life
it
widens
as
it
goes
while
they
walk
along
its
banks
the
river
grows
broader
and
deeper
this
means
that
as
they
grow
older
they
grow
wiser
and
learn
more
so
they
go
on
continually
until
they
come
to
the
mouth
of
the
river
where
it
loses
itself
in
the
ocean
of
what
our
friends
tremble
so
much
as
to
name
tell
me
is
there
terror
or
doubt
or
anxiety
on
their
faces
now
that
they
have
come
to
the
end
no
their
faces
are
entirely
happy
this
you
do
not
understand
christine
if
you
were
sure
that
in
the
end
you
would
be
as
happy
as
that
old
woman
at
the
end
would
you
be
content
to
begin
with
the
beginning
would
you
play
the
part
of
that
girl
and
walk
with
me
along
the
stream
of
life
he
took
her
hand
but
she
made
no
reply
save
that
her
eyes
filled
with
tears
presently
she
murmured
they
are
always
happy
at
the
beginning
and
at
the
end
did
they
know
at
the
beginning
that
there
would
be
an
end
they
knew
everybody
knew
the
very
children
knew
almost
from
infancy
the
great
law
of
nature
that
for
everything
there
is
the
allotted
end
they
knew
it
and
yet
they
were
always
happy
i
can
not
understand
it
we
have
destroyed
that
happiness
said
the
young
man
love
can
not
exist
when
there
is
no
longer
end
or
change
or
anything
to
hope
or
fear
no
mystery
nothing
to
hope
or
fear
what
is
a
woman
outside
the
museum
in
the
eyes
of
the
college
she
is
only
the
half
of
humanity
subject
to
disease
and
requiring
food
at
intervals
she
no
longer
attracts
men
by
the
sacred
mystery
of
her
beauty
she
is
not
even
permitted
any
longer
to
make
herself
beautiful
by
her
dress
nor
is
she
allowed
to
create
the
feeling
of
mystery
and
the
unknown
by
seclusion
she
lives
in
the
open
like
the
rest
we
all
live
together
we
know
what
each
one
says
and
thinks
and
does
nay
most
of
us
have
left
off
thinking
and
talking
altogether
but
christine
was
hardly
listening
she
could
not
understand
this
talk
she
was
looking
at
the
pictures
oh
she
said
they
look
so
happy
there
is
such
a
beautiful
contentment
in
their
eyes
they
love
each
other
so
that
they
think
of
nothing
but
their
love
they
have
forgotten
the
end
nay
but
look
at
the
end
they
are
happy
still
although
the
river
flows
into
the
ocean
how
can
they
be
happy
you
shall
learn
more
christine
you
have
seen
enough
to
understand
that
the
talk
of
the
physicians
about
the
miseries
of
the
old
time
is
mischievous
nonsense
with
which
they
have
fooled
us
into
slavery
oh
if
they
heard
you
let
them
hear
he
replied
sternly
i
hope
before
long
we
may
make
them
hear
christine
you
can
restore
the
old
love
by
your
own
example
you
alone
have
nothing
to
remember
and
nothing
to
unlearn
as
for
the
rest
of
us
we
have
old
habits
to
forget
and
prejudices
to
overcome
before
we
can
get
back
to
the
past
then
he
led
her
to
another
picture
the
scene
was
a
green
village
standing
amid
trees
yews
and
oaks
and
round
a
gray
old
church
six
strong
men
bore
a
bier
piled
with
flowers
towards
an
open
grave
newly
dug
beside
the
grave
stood
one
in
a
white
robe
carrying
a
book
behind
the
bier
followed
a
weeping
company
of
men
women
and
children
but
he
who
walked
first
wept
not
oh
cried
christine
he
is
dead
he
is
dead
she
burst
into
tears
nay
said
jack
it
is
the
wife
who
is
dead
the
husband
lives
still
see
he
follows
with
tottering
step
his
grandchild
leads
him
as
you
lead
your
grandfather
and
they
are
all
weeping
except
him
why
does
he
alone
not
weep
he
has
been
married
for
fifty
years
and
more
all
his
life
has
been
shared
by
the
love
and
sympathy
of
the
woman
the
dead
woman
she
is
dead
my
dear
he
repeated
these
words
taking
the
girl
hands
she
is
dead
and
he
sheds
no
tears
why
not
look
at
his
face
is
it
unhappy
tell
me
christine
do
you
read
the
sorrow
of
hopelessness
in
that
old
man
face
no
no
she
said
he
is
grave
but
he
is
not
unhappy
yet
here
is
death
with
all
the
terrible
things
that
we
read
of
in
the
books
the
deep
pit
the
body
to
be
lowered
in
the
grave
oh
she
shuddered
and
turned
her
head
as
i
read
his
face
said
jack
i
see
hope
and
consolation
why
is
there
a
man
in
white
i
will
tell
you
some
time
meanwhile
observe
that
the
old
man
is
happy
though
his
wife
is
dead
and
though
he
knows
that
his
turn
will
come
and
a
grave
will
be
dug
for
him
beside
his
wife
and
he
also
will
be
laid
among
the
cold
as
cold
as
senseless
as
them
there
to
lie
while
the
great
world
rolls
round
and
round
he
knows
this
i
say
and
yet
he
is
not
unhappy
what
does
it
mean
jack
i
will
tell
you
soon
we
who
are
sailors
this
young
man
continued
are
not
like
the
rest
of
the
world
we
are
always
exposed
to
danger
we
are
not
afraid
to
speak
of
death
and
though
we
have
taken
advantage
as
we
thought
of
the
great
discovery
we
have
never
forgotten
the
past
or
the
old
ideas
we
have
to
think
for
ourselves
which
makes
us
independent
there
is
no
holy
college
on
board
ship
and
no
sacred
physician
ventures
his
precious
life
upon
a
rolling
deck
when
we
come
ashore
we
look
round
and
see
things
then
we
go
on
board
again
and
talk
in
the
night
watches
below
the
stars
i
think
the
holy
college
would
be
pleased
if
they
could
sometimes
hear
our
talk
christine
there
is
no
happiness
left
in
the
world
except
among
those
whom
the
great
discovery
can
not
save
from
the
dangers
of
a
storm
when
you
spoke
to
me
my
heart
leaped
up
because
i
saw
what
as
yet
you
do
not
see
the
others
were
too
sluggish
to
remember
until
you
had
dragged
their
thoughts
into
the
old
channels
but
there
was
no
need
to
drag
me
for
i
remember
always
and
i
only
pretended
until
the
others
should
come
with
me
christine
heard
only
half
of
this
for
she
was
looking
at
the
picture
of
the
village
funeral
again
oh
how
could
men
be
happy
with
such
an
end
before
them
she
cried
i
can
not
understand
it
to
be
torn
away
to
be
laid
in
a
box
to
be
put
away
deep
underground
there
to
lie
forever
oh
she
trembled
again
and
not
to
be
unhappy
look
round
the
room
christine
read
the
faces
here
are
portraits
of
men
and
women
some
of
them
are
eager
some
are
calm
more
are
unhappy
for
thinking
of
the
end
here
is
a
the
dead
and
wounded
are
lying
about
the
ground
look
at
this
troop
of
horsemen
charging
is
there
any
terror
in
their
faces
what
do
they
care
about
the
men
who
have
fallen
their
duty
is
to
fight
see
here
again
it
is
a
dying
girl
what
do
you
read
in
her
face
i
see
no
fear
but
a
sweet
joy
of
resignation
here
is
a
man
led
forth
to
execution
there
is
no
fear
in
his
face
i
could
never
bear
to
be
alone
in
this
room
because
death
is
everywhere
and
no
one
seems
to
regard
it
christine
did
you
never
hear
by
any
chance
from
your
grandfather
why
people
were
not
afraid
no
he
can
not
bear
to
speak
of
such
a
thing
he
trembles
and
shakes
if
it
is
even
mentioned
they
all
do
except
you
what
does
he
tell
you
he
talks
of
the
time
when
he
was
young
it
was
long
before
the
great
discovery
oh
he
is
very
old
he
was
always
going
to
feasts
and
dances
he
had
a
great
many
friends
and
some
of
them
used
to
sing
and
dance
in
theatres
they
were
all
very
fond
of
suppers
after
the
theatre
and
there
was
a
great
deal
of
singing
and
laughing
they
used
to
drive
about
in
carriages
and
they
went
to
races
i
do
not
understand
very
well
the
pleasure
of
his
life
ah
said
jack
he
has
forgotten
the
really
important
part
of
it
they
were
at
a
part
of
the
gallery
where
there
was
a
door
of
strong
oak
studded
with
big
square
nails
under
an
arch
of
carved
stone
have
you
ever
been
into
this
place
he
asked
once
i
went
in
but
there
is
a
dreadful
tomb
in
it
with
carved
skulls
and
the
figure
of
a
dead
man
so
i
ran
away
come
in
with
me
you
shall
not
be
frightened
he
turned
the
great
iron
handle
and
pushed
open
the
heavy
door
the
room
was
lofty
with
a
pointed
roof
it
was
lit
by
long
narrow
windows
filled
with
painted
glass
there
were
seats
of
carved
wood
with
carved
canopies
on
either
side
there
was
the
figure
of
a
brass
eagle
with
a
great
book
upon
it
and
under
the
three
lights
of
the
window
at
the
end
was
a
table
covered
with
a
cloth
which
hung
in
rags
and
tatters
and
was
covered
with
dust
it
was
in
fact
an
ancient
chapel
shut
up
and
suffered
to
fall
into
decay
this
said
the
young
man
is
the
chapel
where
in
the
old
time
they
came
to
worship
they
also
worshipped
in
the
great
place
that
is
now
the
house
of
life
but
here
some
of
them
worshipped
also
though
with
less
splendor
did
they
asked
the
girl
worship
the
beautiful
woman
of
their
dreams
no
not
the
beautiful
woman
they
worshipped
her
outside
in
this
chapel
they
worshipped
the
maker
of
perfect
man
and
perfect
woman
come
in
with
me
and
i
will
tell
you
something
of
what
it
meant
it
was
two
hours
and
more
before
they
came
out
of
the
chapel
the
girl
eyes
were
full
of
tears
and
tears
lay
upon
his
cheeks
my
dear
my
love
said
jack
i
have
tried
to
show
you
how
the
old
true
love
was
nourished
and
sustained
it
would
not
have
lived
but
for
the
short
duration
of
its
life
it
was
the
heritage
of
each
generation
to
be
passed
on
unto
the
next
only
on
one
condition
was
it
possible
it
is
a
condition
which
you
have
been
taught
to
believe
horrible
beyond
the
power
of
words
i
have
tried
to
show
you
that
it
was
not
horrible
my
love
my
sweet
fresh
as
the
maidens
who
in
the
old
time
blossomed
and
flowered
and
presently
fulfilled
that
condition
the
only
woman
among
us
who
is
young
in
heart
let
us
agree
to
love
we
two
after
the
old
fashion
under
the
old
conditions
do
not
shiver
dear
there
is
the
old
faith
to
sustain
us
you
shall
go
to
sea
with
me
perhaps
we
shall
be
cast
away
and
drowned
perhaps
we
shall
contract
some
unknown
disease
and
die
we
shall
presently
lie
down
to
sleep
and
awake
again
in
each
other
arms
once
more
in
a
new
life
which
we
can
not
now
comprehend
everything
must
have
an
end
human
life
must
have
an
end
or
it
becomes
horrible
monstrous
selfish
the
life
beyond
will
be
glorified
beyond
all
our
hopes
and
beyond
all
our
imagination
my
dear
are
you
afraid
she
laid
her
head
upon
his
shoulder
oh
jack
with
you
i
am
afraid
of
nothing
i
should
not
be
afraid
to
die
this
very
moment
if
we
died
together
is
it
really
true
can
we
love
now
as
men
loved
women
long
ago
oh
can
you
love
me
so
i
am
so
weak
and
small
a
creature
so
weak
and
foolish
i
would
die
with
you
jack
both
together
taking
each
other
by
the
hand
and
oh
if
you
were
to
die
first
i
could
not
live
after
i
must
then
die
too
my
head
is
swimming
my
heart
is
beating
lay
your
arm
about
me
oh
love
my
love
i
have
never
lived
before
oh
welcome
life
and
welcome
death
so
that
we
may
never
never
more
be
parted
chapter
the
open
door
it
was
in
this
way
that
the
whole
trouble
began
there
was
an
inquisitive
girl
foolishly
allowed
to
grow
up
in
this
ancient
museum
and
among
the
old
books
who
developed
a
morbid
curiosity
for
the
past
of
which
the
books
and
pictures
and
collections
taught
her
something
yet
not
all
she
wished
to
learn
she
was
unconsciously
aided
by
the
old
man
who
had
been
approaching
his
second
childhood
even
at
the
time
of
the
great
discovery
and
whose
memory
now
continually
carried
him
backward
to
the
days
of
his
youth
without
the
least
recollection
of
the
great
intervals
between
lastly
there
had
come
to
the
town
in
the
pursuit
of
his
business
a
sailor
restless
and
discontented
as
is
the
case
with
all
his
class
questioning
and
independent
impatient
of
authority
and
curiously
unable
to
forget
the
old
times
the
sailor
and
the
girl
between
them
at
first
instigated
and
pushed
on
the
whole
business
they
were
joined
no
doubt
by
many
others
but
these
two
were
the
first
leaders
the
chief
culprit
of
all
the
nominal
leader
but
you
shall
presently
hear
what
kind
of
excuse
could
be
made
for
him
by
himself
as
for
those
whom
they
dragged
reluctantly
out
of
the
tranquillity
of
oblivion
they
were
at
first
wholly
drawn
from
the
class
which
at
the
outset
gave
us
so
much
trouble
the
gentle
class
who
desired
nothing
so
much
as
to
continue
to
live
under
the
old
conditions
namely
by
the
labor
of
others
it
wanted
for
these
people
only
the
revival
of
memory
to
produce
the
revival
of
discontent
when
their
minds
were
once
more
filled
with
the
thought
of
the
things
they
had
lost
the
leadership
the
land
the
wealth
and
with
the
memory
of
the
arts
which
they
had
formerly
loved
music
painting
letters
and
with
the
actual
sight
once
more
restored
to
them
of
their
old
amusements
their
dancing
their
society
their
singing
their
games
and
when
the
foolish
old
idol
love
was
once
more
trotted
out
like
an
guy
fawkes
decked
in
his
silly
old
rainbow
tints
when
night
after
night
they
actually
began
to
play
act
and
to
pretend
these
things
what
could
possibly
follow
but
revolt
with
subsequent
punishment
and
expulsion
you
shall
hear
of
course
they
would
have
been
punished
with
expulsion
had
not
but
everything
in
its
place
five
or
six
weeks
after
the
first
evening
which
i
have
described
at
full
length
the
museum
was
again
occupied
by
the
same
company
increased
by
a
good
many
more
the
women
came
in
more
readily
being
sooner
caught
with
the
bait
of
fine
dress
which
had
such
an
attraction
for
them
that
the
mere
sight
of
it
caused
them
to
forget
everything
that
had
been
done
for
them
their
present
tranquillity
their
freedom
from
agitation
and
anxiety
and
carried
them
back
to
the
old
time
when
they
wore
indeed
those
dainty
dresses
what
they
endured
besides
they
do
not
so
readily
remember
but
the
dresses
carried
back
their
minds
to
the
society
which
once
filled
up
the
whole
worthless
lives
of
these
poor
creatures
i
say
therefore
that
it
was
easier
to
attract
the
women
than
the
men
for
the
latter
no
bait
at
all
corresponding
in
power
could
be
discovered
the
company
assembled
were
engaged
in
much
the
same
sort
of
and
as
on
the
first
evening
they
were
dressed
in
the
old
fashion
they
danced
they
sang
they
talked
and
laughed
actually
they
talked
and
laughed
though
what
there
is
from
any
view
of
life
to
laugh
about
i
never
could
understand
laughing
however
belonged
to
the
old
manners
and
they
had
now
completely
recovered
the
old
manners
anything
however
foolish
which
belonged
to
that
time
would
have
been
welcomed
by
them
so
they
laughed
for
the
same
reason
they
were
full
of
animation
and
the
old
old
unhappy
emotion
which
i
had
thought
blotted
out
forever
restlessness
had
either
broken
out
among
them
or
was
well
simulated
they
were
all
young
save
for
the
old
man
who
sat
in
his
chair
coughing
and
sometimes
talking
christine
had
dressed
him
in
a
velvet
coat
which
gave
him
great
dignity
and
made
him
look
as
if
he
was
taking
part
in
the
play
i
say
not
that
the
acting
was
not
very
good
of
the
kind
acting
of
any
kind
could
never
have
served
any
useful
purpose
even
in
the
past
perhaps
a
company
of
beautiful
women
beautifully
dressed
and
of
gallant
men
i
talk
their
own
foolish
language
amusing
themselves
in
this
way
may
have
given
pleasure
to
some
but
not
to
those
among
whom
i
was
born
in
the
days
when
these
things
were
done
every
night
at
one
part
of
the
town
in
another
part
the
men
were
drinking
if
they
had
any
money
and
the
women
and
children
were
starving
and
much
they
concerned
themselves
about
dancing
and
laughing
laughing
indeed
my
part
of
the
town
was
where
they
starved
there
was
mighty
little
laughing
among
us
i
can
promise
you
in
their
masquerading
they
had
naturally
as
if
it
was
a
part
of
the
life
they
represented
assumed
as
i
have
said
the
old
expression
of
eagerness
as
if
there
was
always
something
wanting
and
yet
i
say
they
laughed
with
each
other
in
the
unreasonable
illogical
way
of
the
past
although
everybody
always
wanted
everything
for
himself
and
tried
to
overreach
his
neighbor
it
was
the
custom
to
pretend
that
nobody
wanted
anything
but
that
everybody
trusted
his
friend
and
that
everybody
lived
for
the
sole
purpose
of
helping
other
people
therefore
they
shook
hands
continually
and
grinned
at
each
other
when
they
met
as
if
they
were
pleased
to
meet
and
well
the
hypocrisies
of
the
past
were
as
ridiculous
as
its
selfishness
was
base
but
three
of
the
party
sat
apart
in
the
picture
gallery
they
were
christine
and
the
two
cousins
mildred
and
jack
carera
they
were
talking
seriously
and
gravely
it
comes
then
said
jack
to
this
that
to
all
of
us
the
present
has
grown
to
be
utterly
hateful
and
to
one
or
two
of
us
intolerable
intolerable
the
other
two
repeated
we
are
resolved
for
our
own
selves
at
least
that
we
will
have
no
more
of
it
if
we
can
help
it
are
we
not
but
cousin
mildred
let
us
remember
that
we
are
only
three
perhaps
among
our
friends
in
the
museum
there
may
be
half
a
dozen
more
who
have
learned
to
feel
as
strongly
as
ourselves
is
half
a
dozen
a
party
large
enough
to
effect
a
revolution
remember
it
is
useless
to
think
of
remonstrance
or
petition
with
the
college
no
king
council
or
parliament
in
the
past
was
ever
half
so
autocratic
as
the
college
of
physicians
i
used
to
read
he
went
on
ages
ago
about
the
domination
of
priests
i
do
think
any
rule
of
priests
was
ever
half
so
intolerant
or
so
thorough
as
the
rule
of
the
physicians
they
have
not
only
deprived
us
of
the
right
of
thought
but
also
of
the
power
of
thought
the
poor
people
can
not
think
it
is
a
truly
desperate
state
of
things
a
few
years
more
and
we
too
shall
sink
into
the
same
awful
slough
some
of
us
were
in
it
already
but
christine
pulled
us
out
said
mildred
shall
we
ever
get
another
chance
of
getting
out
jack
asked
i
think
not
well
jack
go
on
as
for
these
evening
meetings
of
ours
you
may
be
very
sure
that
they
will
be
found
out
before
long
and
that
they
will
be
stopped
do
you
think
that
grout
grout
will
suffer
his
beloved
invention
of
the
common
dress
to
be
trampled
on
do
you
imagine
that
grout
will
suffer
the
revival
of
the
old
forms
of
society
oh
christine
replied
if
we
could
convert
dr
grout
another
danger
said
jack
is
that
we
may
all
get
tired
of
these
meetings
you
see
they
are
not
the
real
thing
formerly
the
evening
followed
the
day
it
was
the
feast
after
the
fight
where
is
now
the
fight
and
all
the
dancing
courting
pretty
speeches
and
tender
looks
meant
only
the
of
love
in
earnest
now
are
we
ready
again
for
love
in
earnest
can
the
men
once
more
worship
the
women
upon
whom
they
have
gazed
so
long
unmoved
if
so
we
must
brave
the
college
and
face
the
consequences
i
know
of
two
people
only
who
are
at
present
so
much
in
earnest
as
to
brave
the
college
they
are
christine
and
myself
he
took
the
girl
hand
and
kissed
it
you
may
add
one
more
jack
said
mildred
if
you
go
away
with
christine
take
me
with
you
for
the
present
is
more
intolerable
than
any
possible
future
that
makes
three
then
there
may
be
more
geoffrey
and
dorothy
are
never
tired
of
whispering
and
billing
perhaps
they
too
are
strong
enough
to
throw
off
the
old
terrors
and
to
join
us
but
we
shall
see
i
think
said
mildred
it
might
depend
partly
on
how
the
case
is
put
before
them
if
you
made
them
see
very
clearly
the
miseries
of
their
present
life
and
made
them
yearn
ardently
for
the
things
which
they
have
only
just
remembered
some
of
them
might
follow
at
all
costs
but
for
most
the
college
and
what
it
holds
would
prove
too
much
yet
you
yourself
and
christine
as
for
me
it
seems
as
if
i
remember
more
than
anybody
because
i
think
of
the
sorrows
of
the
past
i
can
not
tell
now
how
i
ever
came
to
forget
those
sorrows
and
they
are
now
grown
so
dear
to
me
that
for
the
very
fear
of
losing
them
again
i
would
give
up
the
gift
of
the
college
and
go
with
you
as
for
christine
she
has
never
known
at
all
the
dread
which
they
now
pretend
used
to
fill
all
our
minds
and
poisoned
all
our
lives
how
then
should
she
hesitate
besides
she
loves
you
jack
and
that
is
enough
quite
enough
said
christine
smiling
if
you
remember
everything
jack
went
on
gravely
you
remember
mildred
that
there
was
something
in
life
besides
play
and
society
in
a
corner
of
your
father
park
for
instance
there
was
an
old
gray
building
with
a
small
tower
and
a
peal
of
bells
the
place
stood
in
a
square
enclosure
in
which
were
an
old
broken
cross
an
ancient
two
or
three
and
the
graves
of
buried
villagers
you
remember
that
place
mildred
you
and
i
have
often
played
in
that
ground
on
weekdays
we
have
prowled
about
the
old
building
and
read
the
monuments
on
the
walls
on
sundays
we
used
to
sit
there
with
all
the
people
do
you
remember
mildred
clasped
her
hands
how
could
i
ever
forget
she
cried
how
could
any
of
us
forget
because
grout
robbed
you
of
your
memory
my
cousin
he
could
not
rob
mine
alas
she
lamented
how
can
we
ever
get
that
back
again
by
memory
mildred
it
will
come
back
presently
think
of
that
and
you
will
be
less
afraid
to
come
with
us
if
that
was
able
to
comfort
the
world
formerly
when
the
world
was
full
of
life
and
joy
and
needed
so
little
comfort
what
should
it
not
do
for
you
now
when
the
world
is
so
dull
and
dismal
and
the
awful
present
is
so
long
that
it
seems
never
to
have
had
a
beginning
just
as
it
promises
never
to
have
an
end
courage
cousin
mildred
and
now
he
went
on
after
a
pause
for
my
plan
my
ship
is
bound
for
any
port
to
which
the
college
may
despatch
her
she
must
sail
in
about
four
or
five
weeks
i
shall
take
you
both
on
board
christine
will
be
my
wife
you
shall
be
our
companion
perhaps
one
or
two
more
may
go
with
us
we
shall
take
certain
things
that
we
shall
want
i
can
procure
all
these
without
the
least
suspicion
and
we
shall
sail
to
an
island
of
which
i
know
where
the
air
is
always
warm
and
the
soil
is
fruitful
there
the
sailors
shall
land
us
and
shall
sail
away
unless
they
please
to
join
us
and
there
we
will
live
out
our
allotted
lives
without
asking
anything
of
the
college
the
revival
of
that
lost
part
of
your
memory
mildred
will
serve
you
in
place
of
what
they
could
have
given
you
you
agree
well
that
is
settled
then
let
us
go
back
but
as
you
shall
see
this
plan
was
never
carried
out
when
all
went
away
that
evening
mildred
remained
behind
christine
she
said
i
have
something
to
tell
you
take
me
somewhere
to
some
dark
place
where
we
can
whisper
one
might
as
well
have
talked
at
the
top
of
his
voice
just
where
they
were
for
any
chance
of
being
heard
but
guilt
made
the
woman
tremble
come
into
the
picture
gallery
said
christine
leading
the
way
no
one
can
hear
what
we
say
there
my
dear
in
the
old
days
when
people
were
going
to
conspire
they
always
began
by
going
to
dark
galleries
vaults
and
secret
places
this
is
quite
delightful
i
feel
like
a
conspirator
do
laugh
at
me
dear
said
mildred
for
indeed
when
you
have
heard
what
i
have
to
say
you
will
feel
very
much
more
like
a
conspirator
the
room
was
in
darkness
but
for
the
moonlight
which
poured
in
through
the
windows
of
one
side
and
made
queer
work
with
the
pictures
on
which
it
fell
at
the
end
the
moonlight
shone
through
the
door
hardly
ever
used
which
led
from
the
gallery
into
the
garden
of
the
college
beyond
what
is
that
mildred
caught
christine
by
the
hand
it
is
the
door
leading
into
the
college
gardens
how
came
it
open
have
you
a
key
i
suppose
there
is
a
key
on
the
old
rusty
bunch
hanging
up
in
the
museum
but
i
do
not
know
i
have
never
tried
the
keys
who
could
have
opened
it
christine
walked
down
the
gallery
hastily
mildred
following
the
door
was
standing
wide
open
who
has
done
this
asked
christine
again
i
can
not
tell
who
could
have
opened
the
door
or
why
it
has
never
been
opened
before
mildred
shuddered
it
is
thrown
open
for
some
mischief
she
said
we
shall
find
out
soon
enough
by
whom
then
they
looked
out
through
the
door
into
the
garden
of
the
college
the
door
faced
a
semicircular
lawn
run
wild
with
rank
grass
never
shorn
behind
the
lawn
were
trees
and
the
moonlight
lay
on
all
suddenly
the
girls
caught
hands
and
shrank
back
into
the
for
a
tall
form
emerged
from
the
trees
and
appeared
upon
the
lawn
where
he
walked
with
hanging
head
and
hands
clasped
behind
his
back
it
is
the
arch
physician
christine
whispered
it
is
harry
linister
mildred
murmured
then
they
retreated
within
and
shut
the
door
noiselessly
but
they
could
not
lock
or
fasten
it
i
can
see
that
part
of
the
garden
from
a
window
in
the
library
said
christine
he
walks
there
every
morning
and
every
evening
he
is
always
alone
he
always
hangs
his
head
and
he
always
looks
fit
to
cry
for
trouble
what
is
the
good
of
being
arch
physician
if
you
can
not
have
things
done
as
you
want
my
dear
said
mildred
i
am
afraid
you
do
not
quite
understand
in
the
old
days
i
mean
not
quite
the
dear
old
days
but
in
the
time
when
people
still
discussed
things
and
we
had
not
been
robbed
of
memory
and
of
understanding
it
was
very
well
known
that
the
arch
physician
was
in
the
college
by
grout
and
his
party
by
doctor
grout
my
dear
grout
was
never
a
doctor
he
only
calls
himself
doctor
i
remember
when
grout
was
an
ignorant
man
taken
into
professor
laboratory
to
wash
up
the
pots
and
bottles
he
was
thin
just
as
he
is
now
a
short
dark
and
man
with
bright
eyes
oh
a
clever
man
i
dare
say
but
ignorant
and
full
of
hatred
for
the
class
of
culture
and
refinement
it
was
grout
who
led
the
party
which
took
away
land
and
wealth
from
individuals
and
transferred
all
to
the
state
it
was
grout
who
ordered
the
massacre
of
the
old
it
was
grout
who
invented
the
horrible
cruelty
of
the
common
dress
it
was
grout
who
made
the
college
what
it
is
not
what
it
was
meant
to
be
it
was
originally
the
guardian
of
life
and
health
it
has
become
the
tyrant
of
the
people
it
has
destroyed
everything
everything
that
makes
life
possible
and
it
tells
the
people
to
be
happy
because
they
live
it
is
grout
grout
who
has
done
this
not
the
arch
physician
not
harry
linister
why
do
you
say
linister
mildred
my
dear
i
think
that
of
all
women
living
i
have
the
greatest
cause
to
hate
the
great
discovery
because
it
robbed
me
of
my
lover
tell
me
how
dear
i
told
you
christine
that
the
revival
of
the
past
was
the
revival
of
sorrows
that
i
would
never
again
forget
listen
then
and
i
will
tell
you
what
they
were
when
the
great
discovery
was
announced
harry
linister
was
already
a
man
well
known
in
science
christine
but
he
was
also
well
known
in
society
as
well
science
did
not
prevent
him
from
falling
in
love
and
he
fell
in
love
with
me
yes
with
me
we
met
that
fatal
evening
at
the
royal
institution
and
we
arranged
before
the
lecture
where
we
should
meet
after
the
lecture
my
dear
i
knew
very
well
what
he
was
going
to
say
and
oh
my
poor
heart
how
happy
i
was
to
think
of
it
there
was
nobody
in
london
more
clever
more
handsome
and
more
promising
than
harry
he
was
rich
if
that
mattered
anything
to
me
he
was
already
a
fellow
of
the
royal
society
for
some
great
discoveries
he
had
made
everybody
said
that
a
splendid
career
was
before
him
and
he
loved
me
christine
well
well
the
news
of
the
great
discovery
carried
him
out
of
himself
he
forgot
his
love
and
me
and
everything
when
his
eyes
fell
upon
me
again
i
know
not
how
long
after
i
was
in
the
hideous
common
dress
and
he
no
more
recognized
me
than
a
stranger
would
recognize
one
out
of
a
herd
of
sheep
how
could
he
forget
do
you
think
that
jack
could
ever
forget
me
i
am
sure
he
will
not
at
any
rate
now
christine
i
am
going
to
try
something
serious
i
am
going
to
try
to
convert
the
arch
physician
himself
mildred
why
not
he
is
still
a
man
i
suppose
nobody
ever
thought
that
grout
was
a
man
but
harry
linister
was
once
a
man
and
should
be
still
and
if
he
have
a
memory
as
well
as
eyes
why
then
she
sighed
but
that
would
be
too
much
indeed
to
hope
what
if
you
win
him
mildred
why
child
he
used
to
love
me
is
not
that
enough
besides
he
the
great
if
we
have
him
with
us
we
have
also
with
us
all
the
people
whom
we
can
shake
push
or
prick
out
of
their
present
miserable
apathy
why
did
we
ever
agree
to
the
stupid
work
day
by
day
we
began
by
fighting
for
the
wealth
and
those
who
survived
enjoyed
it
why
did
we
not
go
on
fighting
why
did
we
consent
to
wear
this
hideous
dress
why
did
we
consent
to
be
robbed
of
our
intelligence
and
to
be
reduced
to
the
condition
of
sheep
all
because
the
college
had
the
great
secret
and
they
made
the
people
think
that
to
forego
that
one
advantage
was
worse
than
all
other
evils
that
could
happen
to
them
it
was
grout
the
villany
of
grout
that
did
it
now
if
we
can
by
any
persuasion
draw
the
arch
physician
over
to
ourselves
we
win
the
cause
for
all
those
who
join
us
because
they
will
lose
nothing
how
will
you
win
him
mildred
child
you
are
young
you
do
not
know
the
history
of
delilah
of
the
sirens
of
circe
of
cleopatra
of
vivien
of
a
thousand
fair
ladies
who
have
witched
away
the
senses
of
great
men
so
that
they
have
become
as
wax
in
the
hands
of
their
conquerors
poor
harry
his
heart
was
not
always
as
hard
as
stone
nor
was
it
always
as
heavy
as
lead
i
would
witch
him
if
i
could
for
his
own
happiness
poor
lad
and
for
mine
as
well
let
him
only
come
with
us
bringing
the
precious
secret
and
we
are
safe
it
has
been
observed
that
many
hard
things
were
said
concerning
me
grout
and
that
i
have
nevertheless
written
them
down
first
the
things
are
all
true
and
i
rejoice
to
think
of
the
part
that
i
have
always
played
in
the
conduct
of
the
people
since
the
great
discovery
enabled
me
to
obtain
a
share
in
that
conduct
next
it
may
be
asked
how
i
became
possessed
of
this
information
that
you
shall
presently
understand
all
that
i
have
done
in
my
public
capacity
as
for
private
life
i
never
had
any
except
that
one
goes
into
a
private
room
for
sleep
has
been
for
the
advancement
of
humanity
in
order
to
effect
this
advance
with
the
greater
ease
i
found
it
necessary
to
get
rid
of
useless
hands
therefore
the
old
were
sacrificed
to
adopt
one
common
standard
in
everything
so
that
there
should
be
the
same
hours
of
work
for
all
the
same
food
both
in
quantity
and
quality
the
same
dress
and
the
same
housing
as
by
far
the
greater
number
belong
to
what
were
formerly
known
as
the
lower
classes
everything
has
been
a
gain
for
them
now
a
gain
for
the
majority
is
a
gain
for
humanity
as
for
the
abolition
of
disturbing
emotions
such
as
love
jealousy
ambition
study
learning
and
the
like
the
loss
of
them
is
of
course
pure
gain
in
short
i
willingly
set
down
all
that
may
be
or
has
been
said
against
myself
being
quite
satisfied
to
let
the
truth
speak
for
itself
i
have
now
to
tell
of
the
daring
attempt
made
upon
the
fidelity
of
the
chief
the
arch
physician
himself
chapter
vi
the
arch
physician
the
arch
physician
generally
walked
in
the
college
gardens
for
an
hour
or
so
every
forenoon
they
are
very
large
and
spacious
gardens
including
plantations
of
trees
orchards
ferneries
lawns
and
shrubberies
in
one
corner
is
a
certain
portion
which
having
been
left
entirely
alone
by
the
gardeners
has
long
since
become
like
a
tangled
coppice
rather
than
a
garden
covered
with
oaks
and
elms
and
all
kinds
of
trees
and
overgrown
with
thick
underwoods
it
was
in
this
wild
and
secluded
part
that
linister
daily
walked
it
lay
conveniently
at
the
back
of
his
own
residence
and
adjoining
the
museum
and
picture
gallery
no
one
came
here
except
himself
and
but
for
the
beaten
path
which
his
footsteps
had
made
in
their
daily
walk
the
place
would
have
become
entirely
overgrown
as
it
was
there
were
thick
growths
of
holly
and
of
yew
tall
wild
roses
spreading
about
among
brambles
ferns
grew
tall
in
the
shade
and
under
the
great
trees
there
was
a
deep
shadow
even
on
the
brightest
day
in
this
neglected
wood
there
were
creatures
of
all
kinds
rabbits
squirrels
snakes
moles
badgers
weasels
and
stoats
there
were
also
birds
of
all
kinds
in
the
wood
and
in
the
stream
that
ran
through
the
place
there
were
otters
in
this
solitary
place
linister
walked
every
day
and
meditated
the
wildness
and
the
solitude
pleased
and
soothed
him
i
have
already
explained
that
he
had
always
from
the
outset
been
most
strongly
opposed
to
the
policy
of
the
majority
and
that
he
was
never
free
from
a
certain
melancholy
perhaps
he
meditated
on
the
world
as
he
would
have
made
it
had
he
been
able
to
have
his
own
way
i
have
heard
that
much
was
said
among
the
rebels
about
my
conduct
during
these
events
as
wanting
in
gratitude
in
the
first
place
if
it
is
at
all
necessary
for
me
to
defend
my
conduct
let
me
point
out
that
my
duty
to
the
authority
of
the
house
must
come
before
everything
certainly
before
the
claims
of
private
gratitude
in
the
second
place
i
owe
no
gratitude
at
all
to
linister
or
to
anybody
i
have
made
myself
whatever
i
have
done
alone
i
have
done
it
and
unaided
linister
it
is
very
true
received
me
into
his
laboratory
as
and
servant
very
good
he
paid
me
my
wages
and
i
did
his
work
for
him
much
room
for
gratitude
there
he
looked
for
the
proper
discharge
of
the
work
and
i
looked
for
the
regular
payment
of
the
wages
where
does
the
gratitude
come
in
he
next
taught
me
the
elements
of
science
to
be
sure
he
wanted
the
simpler
part
of
his
experiments
conducted
by
a
skilled
not
an
ignorant
hand
therefore
he
taught
me
those
elements
the
better
skilled
the
hand
the
more
he
could
depend
upon
the
successful
conduct
of
his
research
therefore
when
he
found
that
he
could
depend
upon
my
eye
and
hand
he
taught
me
more
and
encouraged
me
to
work
on
my
own
account
and
gave
me
the
best
books
to
read
very
good
all
for
his
own
purposes
what
happened
next
presently
grout
the
became
so
important
in
the
laboratory
that
he
became
grout
the
assistant
or
demonstrator
and
another
was
appointed
a
worthy
creature
who
still
performs
that
useful
function
and
desires
nothing
more
than
to
wash
the
bottles
truly
and
thoroughly
next
grout
became
known
outside
the
laboratory
many
interesting
and
important
discoveries
were
made
by
grout
then
grout
became
too
big
a
man
to
be
any
longer
linister
assistant
he
had
his
own
laboratory
grout
entered
upon
his
own
field
of
research
this
was
a
practical
field
and
one
in
which
he
quickly
surpassed
all
others
remember
that
linister
never
claimed
or
looked
for
gratitude
he
was
much
too
wise
a
man
on
all
occasions
when
it
was
becoming
in
him
he
spoke
in
the
highest
terms
of
his
former
assistant
scientific
achievements
there
was
in
fact
no
question
of
gratitude
at
all
as
for
personal
friendship
the
association
of
years
the
bond
of
union
or
work
in
common
these
are
mere
phrases
the
old
phrases
of
the
vanished
past
besides
there
never
was
any
personal
friendship
quite
the
contrary
linister
was
never
able
to
forget
that
in
the
old
time
i
had
been
the
servant
and
he
the
master
where
equality
has
been
so
long
established
the
continual
reminder
of
former
inequality
is
galling
linister
indeed
was
always
antipathetic
from
the
beginning
except
over
a
research
we
could
have
nothing
in
common
in
the
old
days
he
was
what
they
called
a
gentleman
he
was
also
a
scholar
he
used
to
play
music
and
write
verses
he
would
act
and
dance
and
sing
and
do
all
kinds
of
things
he
was
one
of
those
men
who
always
wanted
to
do
everything
that
other
men
can
do
and
to
do
it
as
well
as
other
men
could
do
it
so
that
though
he
was
a
great
scientific
worker
he
spent
half
his
day
at
his
club
or
at
his
sports
or
in
society
that
is
to
say
with
the
women
and
mostly
i
think
among
the
games
and
amusements
of
the
women
there
was
every
day
i
remember
a
great
running
to
and
fro
of
with
notes
from
them
and
he
was
always
ready
to
leave
any
even
the
most
important
work
just
to
run
after
a
woman
caprice
as
for
me
i
never
had
any
school
education
at
all
i
never
had
anything
to
do
with
society
the
sight
of
a
woman
always
filled
me
with
contempt
for
the
man
who
could
waste
time
in
running
after
a
creature
who
knew
no
science
never
cared
for
any
and
was
so
wont
to
disfigure
her
natural
figure
by
the
way
she
crowded
on
her
misshapen
clothes
that
no
one
could
guess
what
it
was
like
beneath
them
as
for
music
art
and
the
rest
of
it
i
never
asked
so
much
as
what
they
meant
after
i
began
to
make
my
way
i
had
the
laboratory
for
work
play
and
all
when
again
it
came
to
the
time
when
the
property
question
became
acute
and
we
attempted
to
solve
it
by
a
civil
war
although
linister
adhered
to
his
determination
not
to
leave
his
laboratory
his
sympathies
were
always
with
individualism
nay
he
never
disguised
his
opinion
but
was
accustomed
regularly
to
set
it
forth
at
our
council
meetings
in
the
house
of
life
that
the
abolition
of
property
and
the
establishment
of
the
perfect
socialism
were
the
greatest
blows
ever
inflicted
upon
civilization
it
is
not
however
civilization
which
the
college
advances
but
science
which
is
a
very
different
thing
and
the
scientific
end
of
humanity
the
gradual
extinction
of
all
the
emotions
love
jealousy
ambition
rivalry
linister
maintained
made
life
so
poor
a
thing
that
painless
extinction
would
be
the
very
best
thing
possible
for
the
whole
race
it
is
useless
to
point
out
to
one
so
prejudiced
the
enormous
advantage
gained
in
securing
constant
tranquillity
of
mind
he
was
even
sometimes
an
advocate
for
the
revival
of
fighting
fighting
the
old
barbarous
way
of
settling
disputes
in
which
lives
were
thrown
away
by
thousands
on
a
single
field
nor
would
he
ever
agree
with
the
majority
of
the
house
that
the
only
end
of
humanity
is
mere
existence
at
which
science
should
always
aim
prolonged
without
exertion
thought
care
or
emotion
of
any
kind
in
fact
according
to
the
contention
of
my
followers
and
myself
the
triumph
of
science
is
as
follows
the
philosopher
finds
a
creature
extremely
at
the
best
liable
to
every
kind
of
disease
and
suffering
from
external
causes
torn
to
pieces
from
within
by
all
kinds
of
conflicting
emotions
a
creature
most
eager
and
insatiate
of
appetite
fiery
and
impetuous
quarrelsome
and
murderous
most
difficult
to
drive
or
lead
guided
only
by
its
own
selfish
desires
tormented
by
intellectual
doubts
and
questions
which
can
never
be
answered
the
philosopher
works
upon
this
creature
until
he
has
moulded
it
into
another
so
different
that
no
one
would
perceive
any
likeness
to
the
original
creature
the
new
creature
is
immortal
it
is
free
from
disease
or
the
possibility
of
disease
it
has
no
emotions
no
desires
and
no
intellectual
restlessness
it
breathes
eats
sleeps
such
is
my
idea
of
science
triumphant
it
was
never
linister
in
manners
the
arch
physician
preserved
the
old
manners
of
courtesy
and
deference
which
were
the
fashion
when
he
was
brought
up
his
special
work
had
been
for
many
years
the
study
of
the
incurable
diseases
such
as
asthma
gout
rheumatism
and
so
forth
for
my
own
part
my
mind
since
i
became
suffragan
has
always
been
occupied
with
administration
having
steadily
in
view
the
triumph
of
science
i
have
with
this
intention
made
the
social
equality
real
and
complete
from
every
point
i
have
also
endeavored
to
simplify
labor
to
enlarge
the
production
and
the
distribution
of
food
by
mechanical
means
and
thus
to
decrease
the
necessity
for
thought
contrivance
and
the
exercise
of
ingenuity
most
of
our
work
is
so
subdivided
that
no
one
understands
more
than
the
little
part
of
it
which
occupies
him
for
four
hours
every
day
workmen
who
know
the
whole
process
are
impossible
they
ask
they
inquire
they
want
to
improve
when
their
daily
task
is
but
a
bit
of
mechanical
drudgery
they
do
it
without
thought
and
they
come
away
since
labor
is
necessary
let
it
be
as
mechanical
as
possible
so
that
the
head
may
not
be
in
the
least
concerned
with
the
work
of
the
hand
in
this
my
view
of
things
the
arch
physician
could
never
be
brought
to
acquiesce
had
he
been
able
to
have
his
own
way
the
whole
of
my
magnificent
scheme
would
have
been
long
ago
destroyed
and
rendered
impossible
i
suppose
it
was
this
impossibility
of
having
his
own
way
which
afflicted
him
with
so
profound
a
melancholy
his
face
was
always
sad
because
he
could
never
reconcile
himself
to
the
doctrine
of
human
equality
without
which
the
perfection
of
man
is
impossible
it
will
be
seen
in
short
that
the
arch
physician
and
myself
held
hardly
a
single
view
in
common
but
he
had
been
elected
to
his
post
and
i
to
mine
we
shared
between
us
the
great
secret
and
if
my
views
prevailed
in
our
council
it
was
due
either
to
my
own
power
of
impressing
my
views
upon
my
colleagues
or
to
the
truth
and
justice
of
those
views
but
as
to
gratitude
there
was
no
room
or
cause
for
any
as
then
linister
walked
to
and
fro
upon
the
open
space
outside
the
picture
gallery
his
hands
behind
him
his
head
hanging
and
his
thoughts
i
know
not
where
he
became
conscious
of
something
that
was
out
of
the
usual
order
when
one
lives
as
we
live
one
day
following
another
each
like
the
one
which
went
before
little
departures
from
the
accustomed
order
disturb
the
mind
for
many
many
years
the
doctor
had
not
given
a
thought
to
the
picture
gallery
or
to
the
door
yet
because
it
stood
open
and
he
had
been
accustomed
to
see
it
closed
he
was
disturbed
and
presently
lifted
his
head
and
discovered
the
cause
the
door
stood
open
why
what
was
the
door
then
he
remembered
what
it
was
and
whither
it
led
it
opened
into
the
ancient
picture
gallery
the
very
existence
of
which
he
had
forgotten
though
every
day
he
saw
the
door
and
the
building
itself
the
picture
gallery
it
was
full
of
the
pictures
painted
in
the
last
few
years
before
the
great
discovery
that
is
to
say
it
was
full
of
the
life
which
he
had
long
ago
lived
nay
he
lived
it
still
as
he
stood
hesitating
without
the
door
that
life
came
back
to
him
with
a
strange
yearning
and
sinking
of
the
heart
he
had
never
you
see
ceased
to
regret
it
nor
had
he
ever
forgotten
it
and
now
he
was
tempted
to
look
upon
it
again
as
well
might
a
monk
in
the
old
times
look
upon
a
picture
of
fair
women
years
after
he
had
forsworn
love
he
hesitated
his
knees
trembling
for
merely
thinking
what
was
within
then
he
yielded
to
the
temptation
and
went
into
the
gallery
the
morning
sun
streamed
through
the
window
and
lay
upon
the
floor
the
motes
danced
in
the
sunshine
the
gallery
was
quite
empty
but
on
the
walls
hung
one
above
the
other
five
or
six
in
each
row
the
pictures
of
the
past
in
some
the
pigments
were
faded
crimson
was
green
was
gray
red
was
brown
but
the
figures
were
there
and
the
life
which
he
had
lost
once
more
flashed
upon
his
brain
he
saw
the
women
whom
once
he
had
loved
so
much
they
were
lying
on
soft
couches
gazing
upon
him
with
eyes
which
made
his
heart
to
beat
and
his
whole
frame
to
tremble
they
were
dancing
they
were
in
boats
dressed
in
dainty
summer
costume
they
were
playing
they
were
in
on
horseback
on
lawns
in
gardens
they
were
being
wooed
by
their
lovers
what
more
they
were
painted
in
fancy
costumes
ancient
costumes
and
even
with
no
costume
at
all
and
the
more
he
looked
the
more
his
cheek
glowed
and
his
heart
beat
where
had
they
gone
the
women
of
his
youth
suddenly
he
heard
the
tinkling
of
a
musical
instrument
it
was
a
thing
they
used
to
call
a
zither
he
started
as
one
awakened
out
of
a
dream
then
he
heard
a
voice
singing
and
it
sang
the
same
song
he
had
heard
that
night
five
or
six
weeks
ago
his
own
song
the
girls
they
laugh
the
girls
they
cry
shall
their
guerdon
be
alas
that
some
must
fall
and
die
bring
forth
our
gauds
to
see
all
too
slight
give
what
we
might
up
spoke
a
soldier
tall
love
is
worth
the
whole
broad
earth
oh
love
is
worth
the
whole
broad
earth
give
that
you
give
us
all
this
time
however
it
was
another
voice
a
fuller
and
richer
voice
which
sang
those
words
linister
started
again
when
the
voice
began
he
changed
color
and
his
cheek
grew
pale
heavens
he
murmured
are
there
phantoms
in
the
air
what
does
it
mean
this
is
the
second
time
my
own
song
the
foolish
old
song
my
own
air
the
foolish
tinkling
air
that
they
used
to
like
and
the
voice
i
remember
the
voice
whose
voice
is
it
i
remember
the
voice
whose
voice
is
it
he
looked
round
him
again
at
the
pictures
as
if
to
find
among
them
the
face
he
sought
the
pictures
showed
all
the
life
of
the
past
the
with
the
dancers
the
sports
of
the
field
the
drive
in
the
afternoon
the
ride
in
the
morning
the
bevy
of
girls
the
soldiers
and
the
sailors
the
streets
crowded
with
people
the
vile
slums
and
the
picturesque
blackguardism
of
the
city
but
not
the
face
he
wanted
then
he
left
off
looking
for
the
singer
and
began
to
think
of
the
faces
before
him
on
every
face
he
said
there
is
unsatisfied
desire
yet
they
are
the
happier
for
that
very
dissatisfaction
yes
they
are
the
happier
he
paused
before
a
painted
group
of
street
children
some
were
playing
over
the
gutter
some
were
sitting
on
carrying
babies
as
big
as
themselves
one
was
sucking
a
piece
of
picked
up
on
the
pavement
one
was
gnawing
a
crust
they
were
all
ragged
and
half
starved
yet
said
the
arch
physician
they
are
happy
but
we
have
no
children
now
in
those
days
they
could
paint
and
draw
and
we
have
lost
the
art
great
heavens
he
cried
impatiently
we
have
lost
every
art
cruel
cruel
then
from
within
there
broke
upon
his
ears
a
strain
of
music
it
was
so
long
since
he
had
heard
any
music
that
at
first
it
took
away
his
breath
wonderful
that
a
mere
sound
such
as
that
of
music
should
produce
such
an
effect
upon
a
man
of
science
oh
he
sighed
heavily
we
have
even
thrown
away
that
yet
where
where
does
the
music
come
from
who
plays
it
while
he
listened
carried
away
by
the
pictures
and
by
the
music
and
by
his
own
thoughts
to
the
past
his
mind
full
of
the
past
it
did
not
surprise
him
in
the
least
that
there
came
out
from
the
door
between
the
gallery
and
the
museum
a
young
lady
belonging
absolutely
to
the
past
there
was
no
touch
of
the
present
about
her
at
all
she
did
not
wear
the
regulation
dress
she
did
not
wear
the
flat
cap
it
is
said
linister
the
face
that
belongs
to
the
voice
i
know
it
now
where
did
i
see
it
last
to
whom
does
it
belong
she
stood
for
a
few
moments
in
the
sunshine
behind
her
was
a
great
picture
all
crimson
and
purple
a
mass
of
flaming
color
before
which
her
tall
and
slight
figure
dressed
in
a
delicate
stuff
of
soft
creamy
color
stood
clearly
outlined
the
front
of
the
dress
at
least
that
part
which
covered
the
throat
to
the
waist
was
of
some
warmer
color
there
were
flowers
at
her
left
shoulder
her
hair
was
braided
tightly
round
her
head
round
her
neck
was
a
ribbon
with
something
hanging
from
it
she
wore
brown
gloves
and
carried
a
straw
hat
dangling
in
her
hand
it
was
perhaps
the
sunshine
which
made
her
eyes
so
bright
her
cheek
so
glowing
her
rosy
lips
so
quivering
she
stood
there
looking
straight
down
the
hall
as
if
she
saw
no
one
linister
gazed
and
turned
pale
his
cheeks
were
so
white
that
you
might
have
thought
him
about
to
faint
he
reeled
and
trembled
good
god
he
murmured
falling
back
upon
the
interjection
of
the
past
we
have
lost
the
beauty
of
women
oh
fools
fools
we
have
thrown
all
away
all
and
for
what
then
the
girl
came
swiftly
down
the
hall
towards
him
a
smile
of
welcome
was
on
her
lips
a
blush
upon
her
cheek
her
eyes
looked
up
and
dropped
again
and
again
looked
up
and
once
more
dropped
then
she
stopped
before
him
and
held
out
both
her
hands
harry
linister
she
cried
as
if
surprised
and
with
a
little
laugh
how
long
is
it
since
last
we
met
chapter
vii
the
fidelity
of
john
lax
that
morning
while
i
was
in
my
private
laboratory
idly
turning
over
certain
notes
on
experiments
conducted
for
the
artificial
manufacture
of
food
i
was
interrupted
by
a
knock
at
the
door
my
visitor
was
the
porter
of
the
house
of
life
our
most
trusted
servant
john
lax
his
duty
it
was
to
sleep
in
the
house
his
chamber
being
that
ancient
room
over
the
south
porch
to
inspect
the
furnaces
and
laboratories
after
the
work
of
the
day
was
closed
and
at
all
times
to
keep
an
eye
upon
the
fabric
itself
so
that
it
should
in
no
way
fall
out
of
repair
his
orders
were
also
to
kill
any
strangers
who
might
try
to
force
their
way
into
the
house
on
any
pretence
whatever
he
was
a
stout
sturdy
fellow
vigorous
and
strong
though
the
great
discovery
had
found
him
nearly
forty
years
of
age
his
hair
though
it
had
gone
bald
on
the
top
was
still
thick
on
the
sides
and
gave
him
a
terrifying
appearance
under
his
cap
of
scarlet
and
gold
he
carried
a
great
halberd
as
a
wand
of
office
and
his
coat
and
cap
matched
each
other
for
color
and
for
gold
embroidery
save
as
representing
the
authority
of
the
house
and
college
i
would
never
have
allowed
such
a
splendid
appearance
to
any
one
what
have
you
come
to
tell
me
john
i
asked
i
may
explain
that
i
had
always
found
john
lax
useful
in
keeping
me
informed
as
to
the
internal
condition
of
the
college
and
its
assistants
what
was
said
and
debated
what
opinions
were
advanced
by
what
men
and
so
forth
in
the
college
itself
suffragan
he
said
and
in
the
house
things
are
mighty
dull
and
quiet
blessed
if
a
little
discontent
or
a
mutiny
or
something
would
be
worth
having
just
to
shake
up
the
lot
there
not
even
a
grumbler
left
a
little
rising
and
a
few
heads
broken
and
we
should
settle
down
again
quiet
and
contented
again
do
talk
like
a
fool
john
well
suffragan
you
like
to
hear
all
that
goes
on
i
wonder
what
you
say
to
what
i
going
to
tell
you
now
go
on
john
what
is
it
it
irregular
suffragan
but
your
honor
is
above
the
law
and
before
beginning
a
long
story
mind
you
a
most
important
story
it
is
what
is
it
about
who
in
it
lots
of
the
people
are
in
it
they
do
count
he
in
it
now
come
he
john
lax
had
pointed
over
his
shoulder
so
clearly
in
the
direction
of
the
arch
physician
residence
that
i
could
not
but
understand
yet
i
pretended
he
john
who
is
he
the
arch
physician
is
in
it
there
now
suffragan
bring
out
that
bottle
and
a
glass
and
i
can
then
tell
you
the
story
without
fear
of
ill
consequences
to
my
throat
that
was
once
delicate
i
gave
him
the
bottle
and
a
glass
and
after
drinking
a
tumblerful
of
whiskey
forbidden
to
the
people
he
began
certain
reasons
he
said
had
made
him
suspicious
as
to
what
went
on
at
night
in
the
museum
during
the
last
few
weeks
the
lights
were
up
until
late
at
night
once
he
tried
the
doors
and
found
that
they
were
locked
he
heard
the
playing
of
music
within
and
the
sound
of
many
voices
now
there
is
as
i
told
john
lax
at
this
point
no
law
against
the
assemblage
of
the
people
nor
against
their
sitting
up
or
singing
and
playing
together
i
had
to
be
sure
hoped
that
they
had
long
ceased
to
desire
to
meet
together
and
had
quite
forgotten
how
to
make
music
he
remembered
john
lax
went
on
to
say
that
there
was
a
door
leading
into
the
picture
gallery
from
the
college
garden
a
door
of
which
he
held
the
key
he
opened
this
door
quietly
and
then
night
after
night
he
crept
into
the
picture
gallery
and
watched
what
went
on
through
the
door
which
opened
upon
the
museum
he
had
found
in
fact
a
place
close
by
the
door
where
hidden
behind
a
group
of
statuary
he
could
watch
and
listen
in
almost
perfect
security
i
then
heard
to
my
amazement
how
a
small
company
of
the
people
were
every
night
carrying
on
a
revival
of
the
past
not
with
the
laudable
intention
of
disgusting
themselves
with
the
horrors
of
that
time
but
exactly
the
contrary
it
was
only
the
pleasant
side
of
that
time
the
evening
life
of
the
rich
and
careless
which
these
foolish
persons
reproduced
they
had
in
fact
gone
so
far
john
lax
told
me
as
to
fall
in
love
with
that
time
to
deride
the
present
and
to
pour
abuse
upon
my
name
mine
as
the
supposed
chief
author
of
the
social
equality
this
was
very
well
for
a
beginning
this
was
a
startling
awakener
out
of
a
fool
paradise
true
the
company
was
small
they
might
be
easily
dispersed
or
isolated
means
might
be
found
to
terrify
them
into
submission
yet
it
gave
me
a
rude
shock
i
had
my
suspicions
john
lax
continued
ever
since
one
morning
when
i
looked
into
the
museum
and
see
that
young
gal
dressed
up
and
carrying
on
before
the
more
like
well
more
like
an
actress
at
the
pav
as
they
used
to
make
than
like
a
decent
woman
but
now
there
more
he
stopped
and
whispered
hoarsely
suffragan
i
just
come
from
a
little
turn
about
the
garden
outside
the
picture
gallery
where
there
a
bit
o
turf
and
a
lot
of
trees
all
around
there
a
very
curious
sight
to
see
this
minute
and
if
get
up
and
go
along
o
me
suffragan
you
be
pleased
you
will
indeed
astonished
and
pleased
you
will
be
i
obeyed
i
arose
and
followed
this
zealous
servant
he
led
me
to
a
part
of
the
garden
which
i
did
not
know
it
was
the
place
of
which
i
have
spoken
here
amid
a
great
thick
growth
of
underwood
he
took
me
into
the
ruins
of
an
old
garden
or
built
of
wood
but
the
planks
were
decaying
and
were
starting
apart
stand
there
and
look
and
listen
whispered
john
lax
grinning
the
open
planks
commanded
a
view
of
a
semicircular
lawn
where
the
neglected
grass
had
grown
thick
and
rank
almost
under
my
eyes
there
was
sitting
upon
a
fallen
trunk
a
woman
fantastically
dressed
against
the
rules
and
at
her
feet
lay
none
other
than
the
arch
physician
himself
then
indeed
i
pricked
up
my
ears
and
listened
with
all
my
might
are
we
dreaming
mildred
he
murmured
are
we
dreaming
no
harry
we
have
all
been
dreaming
for
a
long
long
time
never
mind
how
long
just
now
we
are
not
dreaming
we
are
truly
awake
you
are
my
old
playfellow
and
i
am
your
old
sweetheart
she
said
with
a
little
blush
tell
me
what
you
are
doing
always
in
your
laboratory
i
suppose
always
finding
some
new
secrets
does
it
make
you
any
happier
harry
to
be
always
finding
something
new
it
is
the
only
thing
that
makes
life
endurable
to
discover
the
secrets
of
nature
for
what
other
purpose
do
we
live
then
harry
for
what
purpose
do
the
rest
of
us
live
who
do
not
investigate
those
secrets
can
women
be
happy
in
no
other
way
we
do
not
prosecute
any
kind
of
research
you
know
happy
are
we
in
the
present
or
the
past
mildred
he
looked
about
him
as
if
expecting
to
see
the
figures
of
the
pictures
in
the
gallery
walking
about
upon
the
grass
just
now
harry
we
are
in
the
past
we
are
back
we
two
together
in
the
glorious
and
beautiful
past
where
everything
was
delightful
outside
this
place
there
is
the
horrible
present
you
have
made
the
present
for
us
and
therefore
you
ought
to
know
what
it
is
let
me
look
at
you
harry
why
the
old
look
is
coming
back
to
your
eyes
take
off
that
black
gown
harry
and
throw
it
away
while
you
are
with
me
so
you
are
now
my
old
friend
again
and
we
can
talk
you
are
no
longer
the
president
of
the
holy
college
the
terrible
and
venerable
arch
physician
the
guardian
of
the
house
of
life
you
are
plain
harry
linister
again
tell
me
then
harry
are
you
happy
in
this
beautiful
present
that
you
have
made
no
mildred
i
am
never
happy
then
why
not
unmake
the
present
why
not
return
to
the
past
it
is
impossible
we
might
go
back
to
the
past
for
a
little
but
it
would
become
intolerable
again
as
it
did
before
formerly
there
was
no
time
for
any
of
the
fleeting
things
of
life
to
lose
their
rapture
all
things
were
enjoyed
for
a
moment
and
then
vanished
now
he
sighed
wearily
they
last
they
last
so
that
there
is
nothing
left
for
us
but
the
finding
of
new
secrets
and
for
you
mildred
i
have
been
in
a
dream
she
replied
oh
a
long
long
nightmare
that
has
never
left
me
day
or
night
i
do
know
how
long
it
has
lasted
but
it
has
lifted
at
last
thank
god
the
arch
physician
started
and
looked
astonished
it
seems
a
long
time
he
said
since
i
heard
those
words
i
thought
we
had
forgotten
it
was
a
dream
of
no
change
day
after
day
nothing
happened
in
the
morning
we
worked
in
the
afternoon
we
rested
in
the
evening
we
took
food
at
night
we
slept
and
the
mind
was
dead
there
were
no
books
to
read
there
was
nothing
to
talk
about
there
was
nothing
to
hope
always
the
same
work
a
piece
of
work
that
nobody
cared
to
do
a
mechanical
piece
of
work
always
the
same
dress
the
same
hideous
horrible
dress
we
were
all
alike
there
was
nothing
at
all
to
distinguish
us
the
past
seemed
forgotten
nothing
can
be
ever
forgotten
said
linister
but
it
may
be
put
away
for
a
time
oh
when
i
think
of
all
that
we
had
forgotten
it
seems
terrible
yet
we
lived
how
could
we
live
it
was
not
life
no
thought
no
care
about
anything
every
one
centred
in
himself
careless
of
his
neighbor
why
i
did
not
know
so
much
as
the
occupants
of
the
rooms
next
to
my
own
men
looked
on
women
and
women
on
men
without
thought
or
emotion
love
was
dead
life
was
death
harry
it
was
a
most
dreadful
dream
and
in
the
night
there
used
to
come
a
terrible
nightmare
of
nothingness
it
was
as
if
i
floated
alone
in
ether
far
from
the
world
or
life
and
could
find
nothing
nothing
for
the
mind
to
grasp
or
think
of
and
i
woke
at
the
point
of
madness
a
dreadful
dream
and
yet
we
lived
rather
than
go
back
to
that
most
terrible
dream
i
would
i
would
she
clasped
her
forehead
with
her
hand
and
looked
about
her
with
haggard
eyes
yes
yes
said
linister
i
ought
to
have
guessed
your
sufferings
by
my
own
yet
i
have
had
my
laboratory
then
i
was
shaken
out
of
the
dream
by
a
girl
by
christine
and
now
we
are
resolved
some
of
us
at
all
costs
and
hazards
yes
even
if
we
are
debarred
from
the
great
discovery
to
live
again
to
live
again
she
repeated
slowly
do
you
know
harry
what
that
means
to
go
back
to
live
again
only
think
what
that
means
he
was
silent
have
you
forgotten
harry
she
asked
softly
what
that
means
no
he
said
i
remember
everything
but
i
am
trying
to
understand
the
accursed
present
is
around
and
above
me
like
a
horrible
black
fog
how
can
we
lift
it
how
can
we
live
again
some
of
us
have
found
out
a
way
in
the
morning
we
put
on
the
odious
uniform
and
do
our
allotted
task
among
the
poor
wretches
who
are
still
in
that
bad
dream
of
monotony
we
sit
among
them
silent
ourselves
trying
to
disguise
the
new
light
that
has
come
back
to
our
eyes
in
the
public
hall
in
the
evening
we
come
here
put
on
the
old
dresses
and
live
the
old
life
it
is
wonderful
he
said
i
knew
all
along
that
human
nature
would
one
day
assert
itself
again
i
told
grout
so
he
has
always
been
quite
wrong
grout
what
does
grout
know
of
civilized
life
grout
why
he
was
your
own
a
common
servant
he
thought
it
was
justice
to
reduce
everybody
to
his
own
level
and
happiness
for
them
to
remain
there
grout
why
he
has
only
one
idea
to
make
us
mere
machines
oh
harry
she
said
reproach
in
her
eyes
you
are
arch
physician
and
you
can
not
alter
things
no
i
have
the
majority
of
the
college
against
me
am
i
looking
well
harry
after
all
these
years
she
suddenly
changed
her
voice
and
manner
and
laughed
and
turned
her
face
to
meet
his
witch
abominable
witch
well
mildred
was
it
yesterday
that
i
loved
you
was
the
great
discovery
made
only
yesterday
oh
you
look
lovelier
than
ever
lovely
means
worthy
of
love
harry
but
you
have
killed
love
no
no
love
died
we
did
not
kill
love
why
did
the
men
cease
to
love
the
women
was
it
that
they
saw
them
every
day
and
so
grew
tired
of
them
perhaps
it
was
because
you
took
from
us
the
things
that
might
have
kept
love
alive
music
art
literature
grace
culture
society
everything
we
did
not
take
them
they
died
and
then
you
dressed
us
all
alike
in
the
most
hideous
costume
ever
invented
it
was
grout
dress
what
is
the
good
of
being
arch
physician
if
one
can
not
have
his
own
way
harry
sighed
my
place
is
in
the
laboratory
he
said
i
experiment
and
i
discover
the
suffragan
administers
it
has
always
been
the
rule
yet
you
live
again
mildred
tell
me
more
i
do
not
understand
how
you
contrive
to
live
again
we
have
a
little
company
of
twenty
or
thirty
who
meet
together
in
the
evening
after
the
dinner
is
over
no
one
else
ever
comes
to
the
museum
as
soon
as
it
is
dark
you
know
very
well
the
people
all
creep
home
and
go
to
bed
but
my
friends
come
here
it
was
christine
who
began
it
she
found
or
made
the
dresses
for
us
she
beguiled
us
into
forgetting
the
present
and
going
back
to
the
past
now
we
have
succeeded
in
caring
nothing
at
all
about
the
present
we
began
by
pretending
it
is
no
longer
pretence
the
past
lives
again
and
we
hate
the
present
oh
we
hate
and
loathe
it
yes
yes
but
how
do
you
revive
the
past
we
have
dances
you
used
to
dance
very
well
formerly
my
dear
harry
that
was
before
you
walked
every
day
in
a
grand
procession
and
took
the
highest
place
in
the
public
hall
i
wonder
if
you
could
dance
again
nature
secrets
are
not
so
heavy
that
they
would
clog
your
feet
are
they
we
sing
and
play
the
old
music
has
been
found
and
we
are
beginning
to
play
it
properly
again
we
talk
we
act
little
plays
sometimes
we
draw
or
paint
and
oh
harry
the
men
have
begun
again
to
make
love
real
ardent
love
all
the
dear
old
passions
are
reviving
we
are
always
finding
other
poor
creatures
like
ourselves
who
were
once
ladies
and
gentlemen
and
now
are
aimless
and
soulless
and
we
recruit
them
what
will
grout
say
when
he
finds
it
out
he
can
never
make
us
go
back
to
the
present
again
so
far
i
defy
grout
harry
the
arch
physician
sighed
the
old
life
he
said
the
old
life
i
will
confess
mildred
that
i
have
never
forgotten
it
not
for
a
day
and
i
have
never
ceased
to
regret
that
it
was
not
continued
grout
pulled
it
to
pieces
but
we
will
revive
it
if
it
could
be
revived
but
that
is
impossible
nothing
is
impossible
to
you
nothing
to
you
consider
harry
she
whispered
you
have
the
secret
he
started
and
changed
color
yes
yes
he
said
but
what
then
come
and
see
the
old
life
revived
come
this
evening
come
dear
harry
she
laid
a
hand
upon
his
arm
come
for
auld
lang
syne
can
the
old
emotions
revive
again
even
in
the
breast
of
the
arch
physician
his
eyes
met
hers
he
trembled
a
sure
sign
that
the
old
spirit
was
reviving
in
him
then
he
spoke
in
a
kind
of
murmur
i
have
been
living
alone
so
long
so
long
that
i
thought
there
was
nothing
left
but
solitude
forever
grout
likes
it
he
will
have
it
that
loneliness
belongs
to
the
higher
life
come
to
us
she
replied
her
hand
still
on
his
arm
her
eyes
turned
so
as
to
look
into
his
ah
shameless
witch
we
are
not
lonely
we
talk
we
exchange
looks
and
smiles
we
have
begun
again
to
practise
the
old
arts
we
have
begun
to
read
in
each
other
souls
old
thoughts
that
we
had
long
forgotten
are
pouring
back
into
our
minds
it
is
strange
to
find
them
there
again
come
harry
forget
the
laboratory
for
a
while
and
come
with
us
but
come
without
grout
the
mere
aspect
of
grout
would
cause
all
our
innocent
joys
to
take
flight
and
vanish
come
be
no
more
the
sacred
head
of
the
holy
college
but
my
dear
old
friend
and
companion
harry
linister
who
might
have
been
but
for
the
great
discovery
but
that
is
foolish
come
harry
come
this
evening
chapter
viii
the
arch
traitor
i
dismissed
john
lax
charging
him
with
the
most
profound
secrecy
i
knew
and
had
known
for
a
long
time
that
this
man
formerly
the
avowed
enemy
of
aristocrats
nourished
an
extraordinary
hatred
for
the
arch
physician
and
therefore
i
was
certain
that
he
would
keep
silence
i
resolved
that
i
would
myself
keep
a
watch
and
if
possible
be
present
at
the
meeting
of
this
evening
what
would
happen
i
knew
not
nor
could
i
tell
what
to
do
there
are
no
laws
in
our
community
to
prevent
such
meetings
if
the
arch
physician
chooses
to
attend
such
a
how
is
he
to
be
prevented
but
i
would
myself
watch
you
shall
hear
how
i
was
rewarded
linister
was
as
usual
melancholy
and
preoccupied
at
supper
he
said
nothing
of
what
he
intended
as
for
me
i
looked
about
the
hall
to
see
if
there
were
any
whom
i
could
detect
from
any
unnatural
restlessness
as
members
of
this
dangerous
company
but
i
could
see
none
except
the
girl
christine
whose
vivacity
might
be
allowed
on
the
score
of
youth
the
face
of
john
lax
it
is
true
as
he
sat
at
the
lowest
place
of
our
table
betokened
an
joy
and
an
eagerness
quite
interesting
to
one
who
understood
the
meaning
of
these
emotions
poor
john
lax
never
again
shall
we
find
one
like
unto
him
for
zeal
and
strength
and
courage
i
waited
until
nine
then
i
sallied
forth
it
was
a
dark
night
and
still
there
was
no
moon
the
sky
was
cloudy
no
wind
was
in
the
air
and
from
time
to
time
there
were
low
rumblings
of
distant
thunder
i
made
my
way
cautiously
and
noiselessly
through
the
dark
garden
to
the
entrance
of
the
picture
gallery
which
the
faithful
john
lax
had
left
open
for
me
i
ventured
with
every
precaution
into
the
gallery
it
seemed
quite
empty
but
at
the
end
there
was
a
door
opening
into
the
museum
which
poured
a
narrow
stream
of
light
straight
down
the
middle
of
the
gallery
i
crept
along
the
dark
wall
and
presently
found
myself
at
the
end
close
to
this
door
and
here
i
came
upon
the
group
of
statuary
of
which
john
lax
had
told
me
where
i
could
crouch
and
hide
in
perfect
safety
unseen
myself
yet
able
to
see
everything
that
went
on
within
i
confess
that
even
the
revelations
of
john
lax
had
not
prepared
me
for
the
scene
which
met
my
eyes
there
were
thirty
or
forty
men
and
women
present
the
room
was
lit
up
there
were
flowers
in
vases
set
about
there
was
a
musical
instrument
at
which
one
sat
down
and
sang
when
she
had
finished
everybody
began
to
laugh
and
talk
then
another
sat
down
and
began
to
play
and
then
they
went
out
upon
the
floor
two
by
two
in
pairs
and
began
to
twirl
round
like
teetotums
as
for
their
dresses
i
never
saw
the
like
for
the
women
were
dressed
in
frocks
of
silk
white
pink
trimmed
with
lace
with
jewels
on
their
arms
and
necks
and
long
white
gloves
and
flowers
in
their
hair
in
their
hands
they
carried
fans
and
their
dresses
were
low
exposing
their
necks
and
so
much
of
their
arms
as
was
not
covered
up
with
gloves
and
they
looked
excited
and
eager
the
expression
which
i
had
striven
so
long
to
impart
to
their
faces
that
of
tranquillity
was
gone
the
old
unhappy
eagerness
with
flashing
eyes
flushed
cheeks
and
panting
breath
was
come
back
to
them
again
heavens
what
could
be
done
as
for
the
men
they
wore
a
dress
all
alike
why
then
did
they
dislike
the
regulation
blue
flannel
with
a
large
white
and
white
ties
and
white
gloves
and
they
too
were
full
of
the
restless
eagerness
and
excitement
so
different
were
they
all
from
the
men
and
women
whom
i
had
observed
day
after
day
in
the
public
hall
that
i
could
remember
not
one
except
the
girl
christine
and
and
yes
among
them
there
was
none
other
than
the
arch
physician
himself
laughing
talking
dancing
among
the
rest
i
could
see
perfectly
well
through
the
open
door
and
i
was
quite
certain
that
no
one
could
see
me
but
i
crouched
lower
behind
the
marble
group
when
they
began
to
come
out
two
by
two
and
to
talk
together
in
the
dark
gallery
first
came
the
girl
christine
and
the
sailor
jack
carera
him
at
all
events
i
remembered
they
took
each
other
hands
and
began
to
kiss
each
other
and
to
talk
the
greatest
nonsense
imaginable
no
one
would
ever
believe
that
sane
people
could
possibly
talk
such
nonsense
then
they
went
back
and
another
pair
came
out
and
went
on
in
the
same
ridiculous
fashion
one
has
been
to
a
theatre
in
the
old
time
and
heard
a
couple
of
lovers
talking
nonsense
on
the
stage
but
never
on
any
stage
did
i
ever
hear
such
false
extravagant
absurd
stuff
talked
as
i
did
when
i
lay
hidden
behind
that
group
in
marble
presently
i
listened
with
interest
renewed
because
the
pair
which
came
into
the
gallery
was
none
other
than
the
pair
i
had
that
morning
watched
in
the
garden
the
arch
physician
and
the
woman
he
called
mildred
though
now
i
should
hardly
have
known
her
because
she
was
so
dressed
up
and
disguised
she
looked
indeed
a
very
splendid
creature
not
in
the
least
like
a
plain
woman
and
this
i
take
it
was
what
these
great
ladies
desired
not
to
be
taken
as
plain
women
yet
they
were
in
spite
of
their
fine
clothes
plain
and
simple
women
just
as
much
as
any
wench
of
whitechapel
in
the
old
time
harry
she
said
i
thank
you
from
my
very
heart
for
coming
now
we
shall
have
hope
what
hope
he
replied
what
hope
what
can
i
do
for
you
while
the
majority
of
the
college
continue
to
side
with
grout
what
hope
can
i
bring
you
never
mind
the
majority
consider
harry
you
have
the
great
secret
let
us
all
go
away
together
and
found
a
new
colony
where
we
will
have
no
grout
and
we
will
live
our
own
lives
do
you
love
me
harry
love
you
mildred
oh
he
sighed
deeply
it
is
a
stream
that
has
been
dammed
up
all
these
years
what
keeps
us
here
asked
the
girl
it
is
that
in
your
hands
lies
the
great
secret
our
people
would
be
afraid
to
go
without
it
if
we
have
it
jack
will
take
us
to
some
island
that
he
knows
of
across
the
seas
but
we
can
not
go
without
the
secret
you
shall
bring
it
with
you
when
could
we
go
he
asked
whispering
we
could
go
at
any
time
in
a
day
in
a
week
when
you
please
oh
harry
will
you
indeed
rescue
us
will
you
come
with
us
some
of
us
are
resolved
to
go
secret
or
not
i
am
one
of
those
will
you
let
me
go
alone
is
it
impossible
he
said
that
you
should
go
without
the
secret
yes
she
said
the
people
would
be
afraid
but
oh
to
think
of
a
new
life
where
we
shall
no
longer
be
all
the
same
but
different
every
one
shall
have
his
own
possessions
again
whatever
he
can
win
every
one
his
own
profession
the
women
shall
dress
as
they
please
we
shall
have
art
and
music
and
poetry
again
and
oh
harry
she
leaned
her
head
upon
his
shoulder
we
shall
have
love
again
oh
to
think
of
it
oh
to
think
of
it
love
once
more
and
with
love
think
of
all
the
other
things
that
will
come
back
come
back
harry
the
old
faith
which
formerly
made
us
happy
her
voice
choked
and
she
burst
into
tears
i
crouched
behind
the
statues
listening
what
did
she
cry
about
the
old
faith
she
could
have
that
if
she
wanted
i
suppose
without
crying
over
it
no
law
whatever
against
it
linister
said
nothing
but
i
saw
that
he
was
shaking
actually
shaking
and
trembling
all
over
a
most
remarkable
person
who
would
have
believed
that
weakness
so
lamentable
could
lie
behind
so
much
science
i
yield
he
said
i
yield
mildred
the
present
is
so
horrible
that
it
absolves
me
even
from
the
most
solemn
oath
love
has
been
killed
we
will
revive
it
again
all
the
sweet
and
precious
things
that
made
life
happy
have
been
killed
art
and
learning
and
music
all
have
been
killed
we
will
revive
them
yes
i
will
go
with
you
my
dear
and
since
you
can
not
go
without
i
will
bring
the
secret
with
me
oh
harry
harry
she
flung
herself
into
his
arms
you
have
made
me
more
happy
than
words
can
tell
oh
you
are
mine
you
are
mine
and
i
am
yours
as
for
the
secret
he
went
on
it
belongs
if
it
is
to
be
used
at
all
to
all
mankind
why
did
the
college
of
physicians
guard
it
in
their
own
jealous
keeping
save
to
make
themselves
into
a
mysterious
and
separate
caste
must
men
always
appoint
sacred
guardians
of
mysteries
which
belong
to
all
my
dear
since
the
great
discovery
man
has
been
sinking
lower
and
lower
he
can
go
very
little
lower
now
you
have
been
rescued
from
the
appalling
fate
which
grout
calls
the
triumph
of
science
yes
yes
he
repeated
as
if
uncertain
the
secret
belongs
to
all
or
none
let
all
have
it
and
work
out
their
destiny
in
freedom
or
let
none
have
it
and
so
let
us
go
back
to
the
old
times
when
such
great
things
were
done
against
the
fearful
odds
of
so
short
and
uncertain
a
span
which
would
be
the
better
only
come
with
us
my
lover
oh
can
a
simple
woman
make
you
happy
come
with
us
but
let
our
friends
know
else
they
will
not
come
with
us
that
whenever
we
go
we
have
the
secret
it
belongs
to
all
he
repeated
come
with
me
then
mildred
to
the
house
of
life
you
shall
be
the
first
to
whom
the
secret
shall
be
revealed
and
you
if
you
please
shall
tell
it
to
all
our
friends
it
is
the
secret
and
that
alone
which
keeps
up
the
authority
of
the
college
come
it
is
dark
but
i
have
a
key
to
the
north
postern
come
with
me
in
the
beginning
of
this
new
life
which
lies
before
us
i
will
if
you
wish
give
the
secret
to
all
who
share
it
come
my
love
my
bride
he
led
her
by
the
hand
quickly
down
the
picture
gallery
and
out
into
the
garden
i
looked
round
the
silly
folk
in
the
museum
were
going
on
with
their
masquerade
laughing
singing
dancing
the
girl
christine
ran
in
and
out
among
them
with
bright
eyes
and
eager
looks
and
the
eyes
of
the
sailor
jack
carera
followed
her
everywhere
oh
yes
i
knew
what
those
eyes
meant
the
old
selfishness
the
subjection
of
the
woman
she
was
to
be
his
property
and
yet
she
seemed
to
like
it
forever
and
anon
she
made
some
excuse
to
pass
him
and
touched
his
hand
as
she
passed
and
smiled
sweetly
i
dare
say
that
she
was
a
beautiful
girl
but
beauty
has
nothing
at
all
to
do
with
the
administration
of
the
people
however
there
was
no
time
to
be
lost
the
arch
physician
was
going
to
betray
the
great
secret
happily
he
would
have
to
go
all
the
way
round
to
the
north
postern
there
was
time
if
i
was
quick
to
call
witnesses
and
to
seize
him
in
the
very
act
and
then
the
penalty
death
death
death
chapter
ix
in
the
inner
house
the
house
of
life
you
have
already
learned
is
a
great
and
venerable
building
we
build
no
such
houses
now
no
one
but
those
who
belong
to
the
holy
college
the
arch
physician
the
suffragan
the
fellows
or
physicians
and
the
assistants
are
permitted
to
enter
its
doors
or
to
witness
the
work
that
is
carried
on
within
these
walls
it
is
however
very
well
understood
that
this
work
concerns
the
prolongation
of
the
vital
forces
first
the
preservation
of
health
next
and
the
enlargement
of
scientific
truth
generally
the
house
is
in
fact
the
great
laboratory
in
which
the
fellows
conduct
those
researches
of
which
it
is
not
permitted
to
speak
outside
the
prevention
of
disease
the
cure
of
hereditary
and
hitherto
incurable
diseases
the
continual
lowering
of
the
hours
of
labor
by
new
discoveries
in
chemistry
and
physics
are
now
the
principal
objects
of
these
researches
when
in
fact
we
have
discovered
how
to
provide
food
chemically
out
of
simple
matter
and
thereby
abolish
the
necessity
for
cultivation
no
more
labor
will
be
required
and
humanity
will
have
taken
the
last
and
greatest
step
of
all
freedom
from
the
necessity
of
toil
after
that
there
will
be
no
more
need
for
labor
none
for
thought
none
for
anxiety
at
stated
intervals
food
chemically
prepared
will
be
served
out
between
those
intervals
man
will
lie
at
rest
asleep
or
in
the
torpor
of
unthinking
rest
this
will
be
as
i
have
said
before
the
triumph
of
science
the
house
within
is
as
magnificent
as
it
is
without
that
is
to
say
it
is
spacious
even
beyond
our
requirements
and
lofty
even
beyond
the
wants
of
a
laboratory
all
day
long
the
fellows
and
the
assistants
work
at
their
tables
here
is
everything
that
science
wants
furnaces
electric
batteries
retorts
instruments
of
all
kinds
and
collections
of
everything
that
may
be
wanted
here
behind
the
inner
house
is
a
great
workshop
where
our
glass
vessels
are
made
where
our
instruments
are
manufactured
and
repaired
the
college
contains
two
or
three
hundred
of
assistants
working
in
their
various
departments
these
men
owing
to
the
restlessness
of
their
intellect
sometimes
give
trouble
either
because
they
want
to
learn
more
than
the
fellows
think
sufficient
for
them
or
because
they
invent
something
unexpected
or
because
they
become
dissatisfied
with
the
tranquil
conditions
of
their
life
some
of
them
from
time
to
time
have
gone
mad
some
who
threatened
more
trouble
have
been
painlessly
extinguished
within
the
house
itself
is
the
inner
house
to
enter
which
is
forbidden
save
to
the
arch
physician
the
suffragan
and
the
fellows
this
place
is
a
kind
of
house
within
a
house
those
who
enter
from
the
south
porch
see
before
them
more
than
up
the
immense
building
steps
upon
which
stands
a
high
screen
of
this
screen
which
is
very
ancient
protects
the
inner
house
from
entrance
or
observation
it
runs
round
the
whole
enclosure
and
is
most
profusely
adorned
with
representing
all
kinds
of
things
for
my
own
part
i
have
never
examined
into
the
work
and
i
hardly
know
what
it
is
that
is
here
figured
what
does
it
advance
science
to
carve
bunches
of
grapes
which
everybody
understands
not
to
be
grapes
in
wood
all
these
things
in
the
house
of
life
the
carved
wood
the
carved
stone
the
carved
marble
the
lofty
pillars
the
painted
windows
irritate
and
offend
me
yet
the
arch
physician
who
loved
to
sit
alone
in
the
inner
house
would
contemplate
these
works
of
art
with
a
kind
of
rapture
nay
he
would
wellnigh
weep
at
thinking
that
now
there
are
no
longer
any
who
can
work
in
that
useless
fashion
as
for
what
is
within
the
inner
house
i
must
needs
speak
with
caution
suffice
it
therefore
to
say
that
round
the
sides
of
the
screen
are
ancient
carved
seats
under
carved
canopies
which
are
the
seats
of
the
fellows
and
that
on
a
raised
stone
platform
approached
by
several
steps
is
placed
the
coffer
which
contains
the
secret
of
the
great
discovery
the
arch
physician
alone
had
the
key
of
the
coffer
he
and
his
suffragan
alone
possessed
the
secret
the
fellows
were
only
called
into
the
inner
house
when
a
council
was
held
on
some
new
discovery
or
some
new
adaptation
of
science
to
the
wants
of
mankind
now
after
overhearing
the
intended
treason
of
the
arch
physician
and
witnessing
his
degradation
and
fall
i
made
haste
to
act
for
i
plainly
perceived
that
if
the
miraculous
prolongation
of
the
vital
force
should
be
allowed
to
pass
out
of
our
own
hands
and
to
become
public
property
an
end
would
at
once
be
put
to
the
order
and
discipline
now
so
firmly
established
the
authority
of
the
college
would
be
trampled
under
foot
everybody
would
begin
to
live
as
they
pleased
the
old
social
conditions
might
be
revived
and
the
old
social
inequalities
would
certainly
begin
again
because
the
strong
would
trample
on
the
weak
this
was
perhaps
what
linister
designed
i
remembered
now
how
long
it
was
before
he
could
forget
the
old
distinctions
nay
how
impossible
it
was
for
him
ever
to
bring
himself
to
regard
me
though
his
suffragan
whom
he
had
formerly
made
his
as
his
equal
thinking
of
that
time
and
of
those
distinctions
strengthened
my
purpose
what
i
did
and
how
i
prevented
the
treachery
will
approve
itself
to
all
who
have
the
best
interests
of
mankind
at
heart
the
house
of
life
after
nightfall
is
very
dark
the
windows
are
high
for
the
most
part
narrow
and
though
there
are
a
great
many
of
them
most
are
painted
so
that
even
on
a
clear
and
bright
day
there
is
not
more
light
than
enough
to
carry
on
experiments
and
if
i
had
my
way
i
would
clear
out
all
the
painted
glass
it
is
of
course
provided
with
the
electric
light
but
this
is
seldom
used
except
in
the
short
and
dark
days
of
winter
when
work
is
carried
on
after
nightfall
in
the
evening
the
place
is
absolutely
empty
john
lax
the
porter
occupies
the
south
porch
and
keeps
the
keys
but
there
is
another
and
smaller
door
in
the
north
transept
it
leads
to
a
court
of
cloisters
the
ancient
use
of
which
has
long
been
forgotten
the
key
of
which
is
kept
by
the
arch
physician
himself
it
was
with
this
key
at
this
entrance
that
he
came
into
the
house
he
opened
the
door
and
closed
it
behind
him
his
footstep
was
not
the
only
one
a
lighter
step
was
heard
on
the
stones
as
well
in
the
silence
of
the
place
and
time
the
closing
of
the
door
rumbled
in
the
roof
overhead
like
distant
thunder
and
the
falling
of
the
footsteps
echoed
along
the
walls
of
the
great
building
the
two
companions
did
not
speak
a
great
many
years
ago
in
the
old
times
there
was
a
murder
done
here
a
foul
murder
by
a
band
of
soldiers
who
fell
upon
a
bishop
or
saint
or
angel
i
know
not
whom
the
memory
of
the
murder
has
survived
the
name
of
the
victim
and
the
very
religion
which
he
professed
it
was
perhaps
that
which
was
still
maintained
among
the
aristocracy
when
i
was
a
boy
not
only
is
the
memory
of
the
murder
preserved
but
john
lax
who
soon
after
the
great
discovery
when
we
took
over
the
building
from
the
priests
of
the
old
religion
was
appointed
its
porter
and
heard
the
old
stories
would
tell
all
those
who
chose
to
listen
how
the
murderers
came
in
at
that
small
door
and
how
the
murder
was
committed
on
such
a
spot
the
stones
of
which
are
to
this
day
red
with
the
blood
of
the
murdered
man
on
the
spot
however
stands
now
a
great
electrical
battery
the
arch
physician
now
about
to
betray
his
trust
led
his
companion
the
woman
mildred
carera
by
the
hand
past
this
place
to
the
steps
which
lead
to
the
inner
house
they
ascended
those
steps
standing
there
still
outside
the
inner
house
linister
bade
the
woman
turn
round
and
look
upon
the
great
house
of
life
the
clouds
had
dispersed
and
the
moonlight
was
now
shining
through
the
windows
of
the
south
lighting
up
the
colored
glass
painting
bright
pictures
and
patterns
upon
the
floor
and
pouring
white
light
through
those
windows
which
are
not
painted
upon
the
clustered
pillars
and
old
monuments
of
the
place
those
who
were
now
gathered
in
the
inner
house
listened
holding
their
breath
in
silence
mildred
said
linister
long
long
years
ago
we
stood
together
upon
this
spot
it
was
after
a
service
of
praise
and
prayer
to
the
god
whom
then
the
world
worshipped
we
came
from
town
with
a
party
to
see
this
cathedral
when
service
was
over
i
scoffed
at
it
in
the
light
manner
of
the
time
which
questioned
everything
and
scoffed
at
everything
i
remember
harry
and
all
through
the
service
my
mind
was
filled
with
you
i
scoff
no
more
mildred
we
have
seen
to
what
a
depth
men
can
sink
when
the
hope
of
the
future
is
taken
from
them
the
memory
of
that
service
comes
back
to
me
and
seems
to
consecrate
the
place
and
the
time
mildred
he
said
after
a
pause
oh
the
house
was
very
silent
this
is
a
solemn
and
a
sacred
moment
for
us
both
here
side
by
side
on
the
spot
once
sacred
to
the
service
of
the
god
whom
we
have
long
forgotten
let
us
renew
the
vows
which
were
interrupted
so
long
ago
mildred
with
all
my
heart
with
all
my
strength
i
love
thee
harry
she
murmured
i
am
thine
even
to
death
itself
even
to
death
itself
he
replied
yes
if
it
comes
to
that
if
the
great
discovery
itself
must
be
abandoned
if
we
find
that
only
at
that
price
can
we
regain
the
things
we
have
lost
it
was
grout
who
destroyed
religion
not
the
great
discovery
said
the
girl
we
kept
silence
in
the
house
but
we
heard
every
word
and
this
was
true
and
my
heart
glowed
to
think
how
true
it
was
nay
not
grout
nor
a
thousand
grouts
without
the
certainty
of
parting
religion
droops
and
dies
there
must
be
something
not
understood
something
unknown
beyond
our
power
of
discovery
or
the
dependence
which
is
the
ground
of
religion
dies
away
in
man
heart
he
who
is
immortal
and
commands
the
secrets
of
nature
so
that
he
shall
neither
die
nor
grow
old
nor
become
feeble
nor
fall
into
any
disease
feels
no
necessity
for
any
religion
this
house
mildred
is
the
expression
of
religion
at
the
time
of
man
greatest
dependence
to
the
god
in
whom
ignorant
full
of
disease
he
trusted
he
built
this
splendid
place
and
put
into
it
all
the
beauty
that
he
could
command
of
sculpture
and
of
form
but
it
speaks
no
longer
to
the
people
for
whom
it
was
built
when
the
great
discovery
was
made
it
would
surely
have
been
better
to
have
found
out
whither
it
was
going
to
lead
us
before
we
consented
to
receive
it
surely
said
mildred
but
the
other
interrupted
her
we
did
not
understand
we
were
blind
we
were
blind
yet
we
live
and
you
have
just
now
told
me
how
remember
the
things
that
men
said
when
the
discovery
was
made
we
were
to
advance
continually
we
were
to
scale
heights
hitherto
unapproached
we
were
to
achieve
things
hitherto
unknown
in
art
as
well
as
in
science
was
it
for
the
common
meal
the
common
dress
the
common
toil
the
vacant
face
the
lips
that
never
smile
the
eyes
that
never
brighten
the
tongue
that
never
speaks
the
heart
that
beats
only
for
itself
that
we
gave
up
the
things
we
had
we
did
not
expect
such
an
end
harry
no
we
had
not
the
wit
to
expect
it
come
mildred
i
will
give
you
the
secret
and
you
may
give
it
if
you
please
to
all
the
world
oh
i
feel
as
if
the
centuries
had
fallen
away
i
am
full
of
hope
again
i
am
full
of
the
old
life
once
more
and
mildred
oh
my
sweet
i
am
full
of
love
he
stooped
and
kissed
her
on
the
lips
then
he
led
her
into
the
inner
house
now
just
before
linister
turned
the
key
of
the
postern
the
door
of
the
south
porch
was
softly
closed
and
a
company
of
twenty
men
walked
lightly
and
noiselessly
in
slippers
up
the
nave
of
the
house
arrived
at
the
inner
house
they
ascended
the
steps
and
entered
that
dark
chapel
every
man
making
straight
for
his
own
seat
and
taking
it
without
a
word
or
a
breath
this
was
the
college
of
physicians
hastily
called
by
me
and
gathered
together
to
witness
the
great
treachery
of
the
chief
they
sat
there
silent
and
breathless
listening
to
their
talk
the
secret
was
kept
in
a
cipher
intelligible
only
to
the
two
who
then
guarded
it
in
a
chest
upon
the
stone
table
which
was
once
the
altar
of
the
old
faith
linister
stood
before
the
chest
his
key
in
his
hand
it
would
be
better
he
said
if
the
new
departure
could
be
made
without
the
secret
it
would
be
far
far
better
if
we
could
start
again
under
the
old
conditions
but
if
they
are
afraid
to
go
without
the
secret
why
he
unlocked
the
chest
then
he
paused
again
how
many
years
have
i
been
the
guardian
of
this
secret
mildred
when
i
think
of
the
magnificent
vistas
which
opened
up
before
our
eyes
when
this
great
discovery
was
made
when
i
think
of
the
culture
without
bound
or
limit
the
art
in
which
the
hand
was
always
to
grow
more
and
more
dexterous
the
science
which
was
to
advance
with
gigantic
strides
my
child
i
feel
inclined
to
sink
into
the
earth
with
shame
only
to
compare
that
dream
with
the
awful
the
terrible
the
disgraceful
reality
let
us
all
go
away
let
us
leave
this
place
and
let
us
make
a
new
beginning
with
sadder
minds
yet
with
this
experience
of
the
present
to
guide
us
and
to
keep
us
from
committing
worse
follies
see
dear
here
is
the
secret
the
cipher
in
which
it
is
written
has
a
key
which
is
in
this
paper
i
place
all
in
your
hands
if
accident
should
destroy
me
you
have
the
secret
still
for
yourself
and
friends
use
it
well
use
it
better
than
we
have
used
it
kiss
me
mildred
oh
my
dear
then
as
they
lay
in
each
other
arms
i
turned
on
the
electric
light
and
discovered
them
the
chest
stood
open
the
papers
cipher
key
and
all
were
in
the
girl
hands
the
arch
physician
was
caught
in
the
very
act
of
his
supreme
treachery
and
lo
the
fellows
of
the
holy
college
were
in
the
inner
house
every
man
in
his
place
every
man
looking
on
and
every
man
standing
upright
with
eyes
and
gestures
of
scorn
traitor
they
cried
one
and
all
john
lax
appeared
at
the
door
halberd
in
hand
chapter
x
the
council
in
the
house
brothers
of
the
holy
college
i
cried
you
have
beheld
the
crime
you
are
witnesses
of
the
fact
you
have
actually
seen
the
arch
physician
himself
revealing
the
great
secret
which
none
of
yourselves
even
of
the
college
hath
been
permitted
to
learn
the
secret
confined
by
the
wisdom
of
the
college
to
himself
and
to
his
suffragan
we
are
witnesses
they
cried
with
one
consent
to
my
great
satisfaction
even
those
who
were
of
linister
party
and
who
voted
with
him
against
the
administration
and
policy
of
the
college
spoke
on
this
occasion
for
the
plain
and
undeniable
truth
what
i
asked
is
the
penalty
when
one
of
the
least
among
us
even
an
assistant
only
betrays
to
the
people
any
of
the
secrets
even
the
least
secret
of
the
work
carried
on
in
this
house
it
is
death
they
replied
with
one
voice
it
is
death
i
repeated
pointing
to
the
arch
physician
at
such
a
moment
when
nothing
short
of
annihilation
appeared
in
view
one
would
have
expected
from
the
guilty
pair
an
appearance
of
the
greatest
consternation
and
dismay
on
the
contrary
the
arch
physician
with
an
insensibility
or
a
bravado
which
one
would
not
have
expected
of
him
stood
before
us
all
his
arms
folded
his
eyes
steady
his
lips
even
smiling
beside
him
stood
the
girl
dressed
in
the
ridiculous
mummery
of
the
nineteenth
century
bowed
down
her
face
in
her
hands
it
is
i
she
murmured
it
is
i
harry
who
have
brought
you
to
this
oh
forgive
me
let
us
die
together
since
i
have
awakened
out
of
the
stupid
torpor
of
the
present
since
we
remembered
the
past
and
love
let
us
die
together
for
i
could
not
live
without
you
she
knelt
at
his
feet
and
laid
her
head
upon
his
arm
my
love
she
said
my
lord
and
love
let
me
die
with
you
at
this
extraordinary
spectacle
i
laughed
aloud
love
i
thought
the
old
wives
tales
of
love
and
lordship
were
long
long
since
dead
and
forgotten
yet
here
was
a
man
for
the
sake
of
a
woman
actually
because
she
wanted
to
go
away
and
begin
again
the
old
pernicious
life
breaking
his
most
sacred
vows
and
here
was
a
woman
for
the
sake
of
this
man
actually
and
truly
for
his
sake
asking
for
death
death
with
him
since
when
they
were
both
dead
there
could
be
no
more
any
feeling
one
for
the
other
why
ask
for
death
what
good
could
that
do
for
either
your
wish
i
said
to
this
foolish
woman
shall
be
gratified
in
case
the
judges
of
your
case
decide
that
your
crime
can
be
expiated
by
no
less
a
penalty
fellows
of
the
college
let
this
guilty
pair
be
confined
for
the
night
and
we
will
try
them
solemnly
in
the
college
court
according
to
ancient
custom
i
know
not
how
many
years
had
elapsed
since
that
court
was
held
the
offences
of
the
old
time
were
for
the
most
part
against
property
since
there
had
been
no
property
there
had
been
no
crimes
of
this
kind
another
class
of
old
offences
consisted
of
violence
rising
out
of
quarrels
since
almost
all
these
quarrels
originated
in
disputes
about
property
every
man
in
the
old
time
who
had
property
was
either
a
thief
or
the
son
of
a
thief
so
that
disputes
were
naturally
incessant
there
could
be
no
longer
any
such
quarrels
or
any
such
violence
a
third
class
of
crimes
were
caused
by
love
jealousy
and
the
like
these
two
had
happily
as
we
believed
disappeared
forever
the
last
class
of
crimes
to
vanish
were
those
of
mutiny
when
the
people
grew
gradually
to
understand
that
the
welfare
of
all
was
the
only
rule
of
the
governing
body
and
that
selfishness
individualism
property
privilege
would
no
longer
be
permitted
they
left
off
murmuring
and
mutiny
ceased
you
have
seen
how
orderly
how
docile
how
tranquil
is
the
life
of
the
people
as
it
has
been
ordered
by
the
sacred
college
alas
i
thought
that
this
order
this
freedom
from
thought
was
going
to
be
henceforth
universal
and
undisturbed
our
prisoners
made
no
opposition
john
lax
the
porter
bearing
his
halberd
of
office
marched
beside
them
we
closed
in
behind
them
and
in
this
order
we
led
them
to
the
strong
room
over
the
south
porch
which
is
provided
with
bars
and
a
lock
it
is
the
of
john
lax
but
for
this
night
he
was
to
remain
on
the
watch
below
then
as
suffragan
i
called
a
council
of
emergency
in
the
inner
house
taking
the
presidency
in
the
absence
of
the
arch
physician
i
told
my
brethren
briefly
what
had
happened
how
my
attention
had
been
called
to
the
fact
that
a
company
of
the
people
headed
by
the
young
girl
called
christine
had
begun
to
assemble
every
night
in
the
museum
there
to
put
on
clothes
which
belonged
to
the
old
time
and
to
masquerade
in
the
manners
language
and
amusements
so
called
of
that
time
that
this
assemblage
which
might
have
been
innocent
and
even
laudable
if
it
led
as
it
should
have
done
to
a
detestation
of
the
old
times
had
proved
mischievous
because
strangely
enough
it
had
exactly
the
opposite
effect
that
in
fact
everybody
in
the
company
had
fallen
into
an
ardent
yearning
after
the
past
and
that
all
the
bad
features
of
that
bad
time
the
social
inequality
the
poverty
the
injustice
were
carefully
ignored
upon
this
one
of
linister
party
arose
and
begged
permission
to
interrupt
the
suffragan
he
wished
to
point
out
that
memory
was
indestructible
that
even
if
we
succeeded
in
reducing
mankind
as
the
suffragan
wished
to
be
a
mere
breathing
and
feeding
machine
the
ultimate
triumph
of
science
any
one
of
these
machines
might
be
at
any
time
electrified
into
a
full
and
exact
memory
of
the
past
that
to
the
average
man
the
emotion
of
the
past
would
always
be
incomparably
preferable
to
the
tranquillity
of
the
present
what
had
just
been
done
would
be
done
again
i
went
on
after
this
interruption
to
narrate
how
i
set
myself
to
watch
and
presently
saw
the
arch
physician
himself
enter
the
museum
how
he
exchanged
his
gown
for
the
costume
in
which
the
men
disfigured
themselves
pretended
and
masqueraded
with
them
danced
with
them
no
external
respect
whatever
being
paid
to
his
rank
and
afterwards
had
certain
love
passages
actually
love
passages
between
the
arch
physician
and
a
woman
of
the
people
which
i
overheard
and
repeated
as
far
as
i
could
remember
them
the
rest
my
brethren
of
the
college
knew
already
how
i
hastily
summoned
them
and
led
them
into
the
inner
house
just
before
the
arrival
of
the
criminals
thereupon
without
any
attempt
of
linister
friends
to
the
contrary
it
was
resolved
that
the
trial
of
the
arch
physician
and
his
accomplices
should
be
held
in
the
morning
i
next
invited
their
attention
to
the
behavior
of
the
girl
christine
she
it
was
i
told
them
who
had
instigated
the
whole
of
the
business
a
culpable
curiosity
it
was
no
doubt
that
first
led
her
to
consider
and
study
the
ways
of
the
ancient
world
what
should
be
the
ways
of
the
past
to
an
honest
and
loyal
person
satisfied
with
the
wisdom
which
ruled
the
present
she
read
the
old
books
looked
at
the
old
pictures
and
lived
all
day
long
in
the
old
museum
there
were
many
things
which
she
could
not
understand
she
wanted
to
understand
these
things
and
she
conceived
a
violent
unreasoning
admiration
for
the
old
time
which
appeared
to
this
foolish
girl
to
be
a
continual
round
of
pleasure
and
excitement
therefore
she
gathered
together
a
company
of
those
who
had
belonged
to
the
richer
class
in
the
days
when
property
was
permitted
she
artfully
awakened
them
out
of
their
contentment
sowed
the
seeds
of
dissatisfaction
among
them
caused
them
to
remember
the
past
with
a
vehement
longing
to
reproduce
the
worst
part
of
it
namely
the
manners
and
customs
of
the
richer
class
the
people
for
whom
the
bulk
of
mankind
toiled
so
that
the
privileged
few
might
have
nothing
to
do
but
to
feast
dance
sing
and
make
love
i
asked
the
college
therefore
what
should
be
done
with
such
a
girl
warning
them
that
one
penalty
and
one
only
would
meet
the
case
and
render
for
the
future
such
outbreaks
impossible
again
the
physician
who
had
spoken
before
rose
up
and
remarked
that
such
outbreaks
were
inevitable
because
the
memory
is
indestructible
you
have
here
he
said
a
return
to
the
past
because
a
young
girl
by
reading
the
old
books
has
been
able
to
stimulate
the
memory
of
those
who
were
born
in
the
past
other
things
may
bring
about
the
same
result
a
dream
the
talking
together
of
two
former
friends
let
the
girl
alone
she
has
acted
as
we
might
have
expected
a
young
girl
the
only
young
girl
among
us
to
have
acted
she
has
found
that
the
past
which
some
of
us
have
represented
as
full
of
woe
and
horror
had
its
pleasant
side
she
asks
why
that
pleasant
side
could
not
be
reproduced
i
myself
or
any
of
us
might
ask
the
same
question
nay
it
is
well
known
that
i
protest
and
always
shall
protest
my
friends
and
i
against
the
theory
of
the
suffragan
his
triumph
of
science
we
consider
horrible
to
the
last
degree
i
for
one
shall
never
be
satisfied
until
the
present
is
wholly
abolished
and
until
we
have
gone
back
to
the
good
old
system
of
individualism
and
begun
to
encourage
the
people
once
more
to
cultivate
the
old
happiness
by
the
old
methods
of
their
own
exertion
i
replied
that
my
own
recollection
of
the
old
time
was
perfectly
clear
and
that
there
was
nothing
but
unhappiness
in
it
as
a
child
i
lived
in
the
street
i
never
had
enough
to
eat
i
was
cuffed
and
kicked
i
could
never
go
to
bed
at
night
until
my
father
who
always
came
home
drunk
was
asleep
the
streets
were
full
of
miserable
children
like
myself
where
was
the
happiness
described
by
my
learned
brother
where
was
the
pleasant
side
more
i
said
but
it
suffices
to
record
that
by
a
clear
majority
it
was
resolved
to
arrest
the
girl
christine
in
the
morning
and
to
try
all
three
prisoners
as
soon
as
the
court
could
be
prepared
for
them
according
to
ancient
usage
early
in
the
morning
i
sought
an
interview
with
the
arch
physician
i
found
him
with
the
woman
mildred
sitting
in
the
chamber
over
the
porch
there
was
no
look
of
terror
or
even
of
dejection
on
the
face
of
either
rather
there
was
an
expression
as
of
exaltation
yet
they
were
actually
going
to
die
to
cease
breathing
to
lose
consciousness
i
told
the
prisoner
that
i
desired
to
represent
my
own
conduct
in
its
true
light
i
reminded
him
that
with
him
i
was
guardian
of
the
holy
secret
the
power
and
authority
of
the
college
i
pointed
out
were
wholly
dependent
upon
the
preservation
of
that
secret
in
its
own
hands
by
divulging
it
to
the
people
he
would
make
them
as
independent
of
the
physician
as
the
great
discovery
itself
had
made
them
independent
of
the
priest
the
latter
had
as
he
pretended
the
keys
of
the
after
life
the
former
did
actually
hold
those
of
the
actual
life
the
authority
of
the
physician
gone
the
people
would
proceed
to
divide
among
themselves
to
split
up
into
factions
to
fight
and
quarrel
to
hold
private
property
and
in
fact
would
speedily
return
to
the
old
times
and
all
the
work
that
we
had
accomplished
would
be
destroyed
every
man
would
have
the
knowledge
of
the
secret
for
himself
and
his
family
they
would
all
begin
to
fight
again
first
for
the
family
next
for
the
commune
and
then
for
the
tribe
or
nation
all
this
would
have
been
brought
about
by
his
treachery
had
not
i
prevented
it
yes
he
said
doubtless
you
are
quite
right
grout
he
spoke
quite
in
the
old
manner
as
if
i
had
been
still
his
servant
in
the
old
laboratory
it
was
not
till
afterwards
that
i
remembered
this
and
became
enraged
to
think
of
his
arrogance
we
will
not
argue
the
matter
it
is
not
worth
while
you
acted
after
your
kind
and
as
i
might
have
expected
again
it
was
not
until
afterwards
that
i
considered
what
he
meant
and
was
enraged
when
we
allowed
gentlehood
to
be
destroyed
gentle
manners
honor
dignity
and
such
old
virtues
went
too
you
acted
for
yourself
very
well
grout
have
you
anything
more
to
say
as
for
us
we
have
gone
back
to
the
old
times
this
young
lady
and
i
quite
to
the
old
old
times
he
took
her
hand
and
kissed
it
while
his
eyes
met
hers
and
they
were
filled
with
a
tenderness
which
amazed
me
this
lady
grout
he
said
has
done
me
the
honor
of
accepting
my
hand
you
will
understand
that
no
greater
happiness
could
have
befallen
me
the
rest
that
follows
is
of
no
importance
none
not
the
least
my
dear
this
is
grout
formerly
employed
in
my
laboratory
unfortunately
he
has
no
experience
of
love
or
of
any
of
the
arts
or
culture
of
the
good
old
time
but
a
man
of
great
intelligence
you
can
go
grout
chapter
xi
the
trial
and
sentence
i
was
greatly
pleased
with
the
honest
zeal
shown
by
john
lax
the
porter
on
this
occasion
when
after
snatching
three
or
four
sleep
i
repaired
to
the
house
i
found
that
worthy
creature
polishing
at
a
grindstone
nothing
less
than
a
great
heavy
execution
axe
which
had
done
service
many
times
in
the
old
old
days
on
tower
hill
and
had
since
peacefully
reposed
in
the
museum
suffragan
he
said
i
am
making
ready
his
feet
turned
the
treadle
and
the
wheel
flew
round
and
the
sparks
showered
from
the
blunt
old
weapon
he
tried
the
edge
with
his
finger
is
not
so
sharp
as
a
razor
he
said
but
serve
john
lax
methinks
you
anticipate
the
sentence
of
the
court
suffragan
with
submission
it
is
death
to
divulge
any
secret
of
this
house
it
is
death
even
for
me
porter
of
the
house
to
tell
them
outside
of
any
researches
or
experiments
that
i
may
observe
in
my
service
about
the
house
and
if
so
great
a
penalty
is
pronounced
against
one
who
would
reveal
such
trifles
as
i
could
divulge
what
of
the
great
secret
itself
lax
you
are
a
worthy
man
know
therefore
that
this
secret
once
divulged
the
authority
of
the
college
would
vanish
and
we
even
the
physicians
themselves
to
say
nothing
of
the
assistants
the
bedells
and
you
yourself
would
become
no
better
than
the
common
people
you
do
well
to
be
zealous
john
lax
nodded
his
head
he
was
a
taciturn
man
habitually
but
now
he
became
loquacious
he
stopped
the
grindstone
laid
down
the
axe
and
rammed
his
hands
into
his
pockets
when
i
see
them
women
dressed
up
like
swells
he
began
grinning
john
this
kind
of
language
belongs
to
the
old
days
when
even
speech
was
unequal
no
matter
you
understand
it
lord
sammy
grout
the
brewer
boy
we
were
both
whitechapel
pets
but
i
was
an
old
of
five
and
thirty
while
you
were
beginning
to
walk
the
waste
with
a
gal
on
your
arm
and
a
fag
in
your
mouth
hold
on
now
it
like
this
what
with
the
insolence
of
linister
and
the
sight
of
the
old
dresses
and
the
sound
of
the
old
language
i
myself
was
carried
away
yes
i
was
once
more
sam
grout
again
i
walked
upon
the
pavement
of
the
whitechapel
road
again
i
was
a
boy
in
the
great
brewery
of
mile
end
road
go
on
john
lax
i
said
with
condescension
revive
if
it
is
possible
something
of
the
past
i
give
you
full
leave
but
when
you
come
to
the
present
forget
not
the
reverence
due
to
the
suffragan
right
well
then
it
like
this
i
see
them
men
and
women
dressed
up
in
the
old
fallals
and
goin
on
like
i
seen
on
long
ago
with
their
insolence
and
their
damn
and
all
the
old
feelings
came
back
to
me
and
i
thought
i
was
again
on
a
sunday
mornin
and
askin
my
if
they
always
meant
to
sit
down
and
be
slaves
and
the
memory
came
back
to
me
ah
proper
it
did
of
a
speech
i
made
one
mornin
all
about
this
french
revolution
our
own
revolution
i
sez
sez
i
bring
out
all
the
bloomin
kings
and
queens
i
sez
dukes
and
markisses
the
fat
bishops
and
the
lazy
parsons
less
do
what
the
french
did
less
make
shorter
by
the
i
sez
what
i
said
that
mornin
some
of
the
people
laughed
and
some
of
went
away
there
never
was
a
lot
more
difficult
to
move
than
them
whitechappellers
they
listen
and
then
they
go
away
they
too
much
fine
speeches
give
that
was
the
matter
with
too
much
nothing
never
came
of
it
that
night
i
was
in
the
public
havin
a
drop
and
we
began
to
talk
there
was
a
row
and
a
bit
of
a
fight
but
before
we
was
fired
out
i
up
and
said
plain
for
everybody
to
hear
that
when
it
came
to
choppin
off
their
noble
i
be
the
man
to
do
it
and
joyful
i
said
well
now
sammy
grout
you
were
in
that
public
bar
among
that
crowd
maybe
you
forgotten
it
but
i
remember
you
very
well
you
was
standin
there
and
you
laughed
about
the
choppin
you
forgotten
sammy
think
it
was
a
fine
summer
evenin
you
were
in
church
come
now
you
ca
say
you
ever
went
to
church
sammy
grout
i
never
did
but
go
on
john
lax
recall
as
much
of
the
past
as
you
wish
if
it
makes
you
love
the
present
more
i
would
not
say
aught
to
diminish
an
honest
zeal
right
well
i
never
got
that
chance
there
was
no
of
at
all
when
we
had
to
murder
the
old
people
your
honor
would
have
it
done
scientifically
and
there
was
as
many
old
killed
off
as
swells
which
was
a
thousand
pities
an
made
a
heart
bleed
what
i
say
is
this
here
we
got
a
return
to
the
old
times
quite
unexpected
it
is
now
we
got
such
a
chance
which
will
never
come
again
let
just
see
how
the
old
times
worked
have
a
procession
with
the
executioner
goin
before
the
criminals
his
axe
on
his
shoulder
ready
to
begin
if
you
could
only
be
sammy
grout
again
but
that
ca
be
i
afraid
what
a
day
outing
you
would
have
had
to
be
sure
suffragan
let
us
show
how
the
old
times
worked
and
let
me
be
the
executioner
i
do
it
i
promise
you
proper
i
got
the
old
spirit
upon
me
ah
and
the
old
strength
too
just
as
i
had
then
oh
it
too
much
he
sat
down
and
hugged
the
axe
i
thought
he
would
have
kissed
it
it
too
much
to
think
that
the
time
would
ever
come
when
i
should
execute
a
swell
and
that
swell
the
arch
physician
himself
damn
him
he
always
looked
as
if
everybody
else
was
dirt
beneath
his
feet
i
know
not
i
told
him
gently
what
may
be
the
decision
of
the
court
but
john
lax
continue
to
grind
your
axe
i
would
not
throw
cold
water
on
honest
zeal
your
strength
you
say
is
equal
to
your
spirit
you
will
not
flinch
at
the
last
moment
ah
we
have
some
honest
men
left
the
court
was
held
that
morning
in
the
nave
of
the
house
itself
the
judges
who
were
the
whole
college
of
physicians
sat
in
a
semicircle
whereas
the
three
prisoners
stood
in
a
row
the
arch
physician
carrying
himself
with
a
haughty
insolence
which
did
not
assist
his
chances
clinging
to
his
arm
still
in
her
silk
dress
with
her
bracelets
and
chains
and
her
hair
artfully
arranged
was
the
woman
called
mildred
she
looked
once
hurriedly
at
the
row
of
judges
and
then
turned
with
a
shudder
she
found
small
comfort
in
those
faces
to
her
lover
and
laid
her
head
upon
his
shoulder
while
he
supported
her
with
his
arm
the
degradation
and
folly
of
the
arch
physician
apart
from
the
question
of
his
guilt
as
shown
in
this
behavior
were
complete
beside
mildred
stood
the
girl
christine
her
face
was
flushed
her
eyes
were
bright
she
stood
with
clasped
hands
looking
steadily
at
the
judges
she
wore
instead
of
the
regulation
dress
a
frock
of
white
stuff
which
she
had
found
i
suppose
in
the
museum
as
if
open
disobedience
of
our
laws
would
prove
a
passport
to
favor
she
had
let
her
long
hair
fall
upon
her
shoulders
and
down
her
back
perhaps
she
hoped
to
conquer
her
judges
by
her
beauty
old
time
phrase
beauty
indeed
to
judges
who
know
every
bone
and
every
muscle
in
woman
body
and
can
appreciate
the
nature
of
her
intellect
as
well
as
of
her
structure
woman
beauty
as
if
that
could
ever
again
move
the
world
behind
the
president
chair
i
was
the
president
stood
john
lax
bearing
his
halberd
of
office
the
doors
of
the
house
were
closed
the
usual
sounds
of
laboratory
work
were
silent
the
assistants
who
usually
at
this
hour
would
have
been
engaged
in
research
and
experiment
were
crowded
outside
the
court
i
have
been
told
since
that
there
were
omitted
at
the
trial
many
formalities
which
should
have
been
observed
at
such
a
trial
for
instance
there
should
have
been
a
clerk
or
two
to
make
notes
of
the
proceedings
there
should
have
been
a
formal
indictment
and
there
should
have
been
witnesses
but
these
are
idle
forms
the
guilt
of
the
prisoners
was
proved
we
had
seen
it
with
our
own
eyes
we
were
both
judges
and
witnesses
i
was
once
however
in
the
old
days
charged
and
fined
before
a
magistrate
in
bow
street
for
assaulting
a
constable
and
therefore
i
know
something
of
how
a
criminal
court
should
proceed
so
without
any
unnecessary
formalities
i
conducted
the
trial
according
to
common
sense
what
is
your
name
i
asked
the
arch
physician
harry
linister
once
of
cambridge
and
fellow
of
the
royal
society
what
are
you
by
trade
physicist
and
arch
physician
of
the
holy
college
of
the
inner
house
we
shall
see
how
long
you
will
be
able
to
describe
yourself
by
those
titles
female
prisoner
you
in
the
middle
what
is
your
name
i
am
the
lady
mildred
carera
daughter
of
the
earl
of
thordis√°
come
come
none
of
your
ladyships
and
earls
here
we
are
now
all
equal
you
are
plain
mildred
and
yours
you
girl
in
the
white
frock
how
dare
you
either
of
you
appear
before
us
in
open
violation
of
the
rules
i
am
named
christine
she
replied
i
have
put
on
the
white
frock
because
it
is
becoming
at
this
point
i
was
interrupted
by
a
whisper
from
john
lax
christine
friends
he
said
are
gathering
in
the
museum
and
they
are
very
noisy
they
threaten
to
give
trouble
when
the
trial
and
execution
are
over
i
told
him
arrest
them
every
one
let
them
all
be
confined
in
the
museum
or
perhaps
this
afternoon
we
will
try
them
as
well
the
man
grinned
with
satisfaction
had
he
known
what
a
fatal
mistake
i
was
making
he
would
not
have
grinned
rather
would
his
face
have
expressed
the
most
dreadful
horror
then
the
trial
proceeded
linister
i
said
it
is
a
very
singular
point
in
this
case
that
we
have
not
to
ask
you
whether
you
plead
or
guilty
because
we
have
all
seen
you
with
our
own
eyes
engaged
in
the
very
act
with
which
you
are
charged
you
guilty
i
am
he
replied
calmly
your
companion
is
also
guilty
i
saw
her
practising
upon
you
those
blandishments
or
silly
arts
by
which
women
formerly
lured
men
we
also
saw
her
on
the
point
of
receiving
from
you
the
great
secret
which
must
never
be
suffered
to
leave
this
building
yes
she
said
if
he
is
guilty
i
am
guilty
as
well
as
for
you
i
turned
to
christine
you
have
been
so
short
a
time
in
the
world
only
nineteen
years
or
so
that
to
leave
it
will
cause
little
pain
to
you
it
is
not
as
if
you
had
taken
root
with
all
the
years
of
life
which
the
others
have
enjoyed
yet
the
court
would
fail
in
its
duty
did
it
not
point
out
the
enormity
of
your
offence
you
were
allowed
to
grow
up
undisturbed
in
the
old
museum
you
spent
your
time
in
developing
a
morbid
curiosity
into
the
past
you
were
so
curious
to
see
with
your
own
eyes
what
it
was
to
outward
show
that
you
cast
about
to
find
among
the
tranquil
and
contented
people
some
whose
minds
you
might
disturb
and
lead
back
to
the
restless
old
times
this
was
a
most
guilty
breach
of
confidence
have
you
anything
to
say
do
you
confess
yes
i
confess
next
you
with
this
woman
and
a
company
who
will
also
be
brought
to
justice
before
long
began
to
assemble
together
and
to
revive
with
the
assistance
of
books
pictures
dress
and
music
a
portion
of
the
past
but
what
portion
was
it
the
portion
of
the
vast
majority
full
of
disease
injustice
and
starvation
did
you
show
how
the
old
times
filled
the
houses
with
struggling
needlewomen
and
men
who
refused
to
struggle
any
longer
did
you
show
the
poor
and
the
unemployed
not
at
all
you
showed
the
life
of
the
rich
and
the
idle
and
so
you
revived
a
longing
for
what
shall
never
never
be
permitted
to
return
the
period
of
property
and
the
reign
of
individualism
it
was
your
crime
to
misrepresent
the
past
and
to
set
forth
the
exception
as
the
rule
this
must
be
made
impossible
for
the
future
what
have
you
to
say
christine
nothing
i
told
you
before
nothing
i
have
confessed
why
keep
on
asking
me
she
looked
round
the
court
with
no
apparent
fear
i
suppose
it
was
because
she
was
so
young
and
had
not
yet
felt
any
apprehension
of
the
fate
which
was
now
so
near
unto
her
linister
i
said
before
considering
its
sentence
the
court
will
hear
what
you
may
have
to
say
i
have
but
little
to
say
he
replied
everybody
in
the
college
knows
that
i
have
always
been
opposed
to
the
methods
adopted
by
the
suffragan
and
the
college
during
the
last
few
days
however
i
have
been
enabled
to
go
back
once
more
to
the
past
and
have
experienced
once
more
the
emotions
of
which
you
have
robbed
life
i
have
seen
once
more
after
many
many
years
the
fighting
passion
the
passion
of
private
rights
and
his
voice
dropped
to
a
whisper
i
have
experienced
once
more
the
passion
of
love
he
stooped
and
kissed
the
woman
mildred
on
the
forehead
i
regret
that
we
did
not
succeed
had
we
not
been
caught
we
should
by
this
time
have
been
beyond
your
power
the
secret
with
us
to
use
or
not
as
we
pleased
with
a
company
strong
enough
to
defy
you
and
with
the
old
life
again
before
us
such
as
we
enjoyed
before
you
robbed
us
of
it
we
should
have
welcomed
the
old
life
even
under
the
old
conditions
we
welcome
instead
of
it
the
thing
which
only
to
think
of
makes
your
hearts
almost
to
stop
beating
with
fear
and
horror
he
stopped
that
was
a
speech
likely
to
win
indulgence
from
the
court
was
it
not
i
turned
to
the
woman
mildred
and
you
i
asked
what
have
i
to
say
the
present
i
loathe
i
loathe
i
loathe
i
would
not
go
back
to
it
if
you
offered
me
instant
release
with
that
condition
i
have
found
love
let
me
die
let
me
die
let
me
die
she
clung
to
her
lover
passionately
weeping
and
sobbing
he
soothed
her
and
caressed
her
john
lax
behind
me
snorted
then
i
asked
the
girl
christine
what
she
wished
to
say
she
laughed
she
actually
laughed
oh
she
said
in
return
for
the
past
weeks
there
is
no
punishment
which
i
would
not
cheerfully
endure
we
have
had
oh
the
most
delightful
time
it
has
been
like
a
dream
oh
cruel
horrid
wicked
men
you
found
such
a
life
in
the
old
time
and
you
destroyed
it
and
what
have
you
given
us
in
return
you
have
made
us
all
equal
who
were
born
unequal
go
look
at
the
sad
and
heavy
faces
of
the
people
you
have
taken
away
everything
deliberately
you
have
destroyed
all
all
you
have
left
nothing
worth
living
for
why
i
am
like
mildred
i
would
not
go
back
to
the
present
again
if
i
could
yes
for
one
thing
i
would
to
try
and
raise
a
company
of
men
not
sheep
and
hound
them
on
to
storm
this
place
and
to
kill
yes
to
kill
the
girl
looked
so
dangerous
that
any
thought
of
mercy
was
impossible
every
one
who
belongs
to
this
accursed
house
of
life
here
was
a
pretty
outcome
of
study
in
the
museum
here
was
a
firebrand
let
loose
among
us
straight
from
the
bad
old
nineteenth
century
and
we
had
allowed
this
girl
actually
to
grow
up
in
our
very
midst
well
she
finished
and
stood
trembling
with
rage
cheeks
burning
eyes
flashing
a
very
fury
i
invited
the
court
to
retire
to
the
inner
house
and
took
their
opinions
one
by
one
they
were
unanimous
on
several
points
first
that
the
position
of
things
was
most
dangerous
to
the
authority
of
the
college
and
the
safety
of
the
people
next
that
the
punishment
of
death
alone
would
meet
the
case
thirdly
that
in
future
the
museum
with
the
library
and
picture
galleries
must
be
incorporated
with
the
college
itself
so
that
this
danger
of
the
possible
awakening
of
memory
should
be
removed
here
however
our
unanimity
ceased
for
the
fellow
of
whom
i
have
already
spoken
as
having
always
followed
the
arch
physician
arose
and
again
insisted
that
what
had
happened
might
very
well
happen
again
that
nothing
was
more
uncertain
in
its
action
or
more
indestructible
than
human
memory
so
that
from
time
to
time
we
must
look
for
the
arising
of
some
leader
or
prophet
who
would
shake
up
the
people
and
bring
them
out
of
their
torpor
to
a
state
of
discontent
and
yearning
after
the
lost
wherefore
he
exhorted
us
to
reconsider
our
administration
and
to
provide
some
for
the
active
spirits
as
to
the
death
of
the
three
criminals
he
would
not
he
could
not
oppose
it
he
proposed
however
that
the
mode
of
death
should
be
optional
so
great
a
light
of
science
as
the
arch
physician
had
many
secrets
and
could
doubtless
procure
himself
sudden
and
painless
death
if
he
chose
let
him
have
that
choice
for
himself
and
his
companions
and
as
regards
the
girl
let
her
be
cast
into
a
deep
sleep
and
then
painlessly
smothered
by
gas
without
a
sentence
being
pronounced
upon
her
at
all
this
leniency
he
said
was
demanded
by
her
youth
and
her
inexperience
in
reply
i
pointed
out
that
as
regards
our
administration
we
were
not
then
considering
it
at
all
that
as
for
the
mode
of
punishment
he
had
not
only
to
consider
the
criminals
but
also
the
people
and
the
effect
of
the
punishment
upon
them
we
were
not
only
to
punish
but
also
to
deter
i
therefore
begged
the
court
to
go
back
to
one
of
the
former
methods
and
to
one
of
the
really
horrible
and
barbarous
yet
comparatively
painless
methods
i
showed
that
a
mere
report
or
announcement
made
in
the
public
hall
that
the
arch
physician
had
been
executed
for
treason
would
produce
little
or
no
effect
upon
the
public
mind
even
if
it
were
added
that
the
two
women
mildred
and
christine
had
suffered
with
him
that
our
people
needed
to
see
the
thing
itself
in
order
to
feel
its
true
horror
and
to
remember
it
if
death
alone
were
wanted
i
argued
there
were
dozens
of
ways
in
which
life
might
be
painlessly
extinguished
but
it
was
not
death
alone
that
we
desired
it
was
terror
that
we
wished
to
establish
in
order
to
prevent
another
such
attempt
let
them
i
concluded
be
taken
forth
in
solemn
procession
to
the
open
space
before
the
public
hall
we
ourselves
will
form
part
of
that
procession
let
them
in
that
place
in
the
sight
of
all
the
people
be
publicly
decapitated
by
the
porter
of
the
house
john
lax
there
was
a
good
deal
of
opposition
at
first
to
this
proposition
because
it
seemed
barbarous
and
cruel
but
the
danger
which
had
threatened
the
authority
nay
the
very
existence
of
the
college
caused
the
opposition
to
give
way
why
if
i
had
not
been
on
the
watch
the
secret
would
have
been
gone
the
college
would
have
been
ruined
it
was
due
to
me
that
my
proposals
should
be
accepted
the
sentence
was
agreed
upon
i
am
bound
to
confess
that
on
being
brought
back
to
receive
the
sentence
of
the
court
the
prisoners
behaved
with
unexpected
fortitude
the
male
criminal
turned
pale
but
only
for
a
moment
and
the
two
women
caught
each
other
by
the
hand
but
they
offered
no
prayer
for
mercy
they
were
led
back
to
their
prison
in
the
south
porch
until
the
necessary
preparations
could
be
made
chapter
xii
the
rebels
it
is
useless
to
regret
a
thing
that
is
done
and
over
otherwise
one
might
very
bitterly
regret
two
or
three
steps
in
these
proceedings
at
the
same
time
it
may
be
argued
that
what
happened
was
the
exact
opposite
of
what
we
had
every
reason
to
expect
and
therefore
we
could
not
blame
ourselves
with
the
event
after
uncounted
years
of
blind
obedience
respect
for
authority
and
unquestioning
submission
had
we
not
a
full
right
to
expect
a
continuance
of
the
same
spirit
what
we
did
not
know
or
suspect
was
the
violence
of
the
reaction
that
had
set
in
not
only
had
these
revolutionaries
gone
back
to
the
past
but
to
the
very
worst
traditions
of
the
past
they
had
not
only
become
anxious
to
restore
these
old
traditions
they
had
actually
become
men
of
violence
and
were
ready
to
back
up
their
new
convictions
by
an
appeal
to
arms
we
ought
to
have
arrested
the
conspirators
as
soon
as
they
assembled
we
ought
to
have
locked
them
up
in
the
museum
and
starved
them
into
submission
we
ought
to
have
executed
our
criminals
in
private
in
short
we
ought
to
have
done
just
exactly
what
we
did
not
do
while
the
trial
was
proceeding
the
new
party
of
disorder
were
as
john
lax
reported
gathered
together
in
the
museum
considering
what
was
best
to
be
done
they
now
knew
all
when
john
lax
in
the
morning
arrested
the
girl
christine
by
my
orders
he
told
her
in
plain
language
what
had
already
happened
the
arch
physician
is
a
prisoner
he
said
he
has
been
locked
up
all
night
in
my
room
over
the
south
porch
i
watched
below
ha
if
he
had
tried
to
escape
my
instructions
were
to
knock
him
on
the
head
arch
physician
or
not
the
woman
mildred
is
a
prisoner
as
well
she
was
locked
up
with
him
they
may
hold
each
other
hands
and
look
into
each
other
eyes
in
my
room
as
much
as
they
please
and
now
young
woman
it
is
your
turn
mine
yours
my
gal
so
march
along
o
me
why
what
have
i
done
that
i
should
be
arrested
that
you
shall
hear
march
i
say
you
are
my
prisoner
you
will
stand
your
trial
ah
he
smacked
his
lips
to
show
his
satisfaction
and
wagged
his
head
he
was
a
true
child
of
the
people
and
could
not
conceal
his
gratification
at
the
discomfiture
of
traitors
you
will
hear
what
the
court
has
to
say
ah
again
he
repeated
this
sign
of
satisfaction
you
will
be
tried
and
you
will
hear
the
sentence
of
the
court
ah
ah
do
you
know
what
it
will
be
death
he
whispered
death
for
all
i
see
the
sentence
in
the
suffragan
face
oh
he
means
it
the
girl
heard
without
reply
but
her
cheeks
turned
pale
you
wo
mind
much
he
went
on
you
hardly
know
what
it
is
to
live
you
have
been
alive
long
enough
to
feel
what
it
means
you
only
a
chit
of
a
girl
if
it
was
for
the
example
i
dare
say
they
would
let
you
off
but
they
wo
they
wo
do
try
it
on
do
think
of
going
on
your
knees
or
anything
else
do
go
weeping
or
crying
the
court
is
as
hard
as
nails
the
honest
fellow
said
this
in
his
zeal
for
justice
and
in
the
hope
that
nothing
should
be
said
or
done
which
might
avert
just
punishment
otherwise
had
this
girl
who
was
after
all
young
and
ignorant
thrown
herself
fully
and
frankly
upon
our
mercy
perhaps
i
do
not
say
some
of
us
might
have
been
disposed
to
spare
her
as
it
was
but
you
have
seen
we
waste
time
he
said
march
she
was
dressed
as
i
have
already
related
in
a
masquerade
white
dress
of
the
old
time
with
i
know
not
what
of
ribbon
round
her
waist
and
wore
her
hair
floating
down
her
back
the
old
man
her
grandfather
as
she
called
him
sat
in
his
looking
on
and
coughing
john
lax
paid
no
attention
to
him
at
all
grandad
she
said
kissing
him
you
will
not
see
me
any
more
because
they
are
going
to
kill
me
you
will
find
your
inhaler
in
its
place
but
i
am
afraid
you
will
have
to
manage
for
the
future
without
any
help
no
one
helps
anybody
in
this
beautiful
present
they
are
going
to
kill
me
do
you
understand
poor
old
man
she
kissed
him
again
and
walked
away
with
john
lax
through
the
picture
gallery
and
so
into
the
college
gardens
and
by
the
north
postern
into
the
house
of
life
when
she
was
gone
the
old
man
looked
about
him
feebly
then
he
began
to
understand
what
had
happened
his
grandchild
the
nurse
and
stay
of
his
feebleness
was
gone
from
him
she
was
going
to
be
killed
he
was
reckoned
a
very
stupid
old
man
always
to
keep
the
cases
in
the
museum
free
from
dust
was
all
that
he
could
do
but
the
revival
of
the
past
acted
upon
him
as
it
had
acted
upon
the
others
it
took
him
out
of
his
torpor
and
quickened
his
perceptions
killed
he
cried
my
grandchild
to
be
killed
he
was
not
so
stupid
as
not
to
know
that
there
were
possible
protectors
for
her
if
he
could
find
them
in
time
then
he
seized
his
stick
and
hurried
as
fast
as
his
tottering
limbs
would
carry
him
to
the
nearest
field
where
he
knew
the
sailor
named
john
or
jack
carera
was
employed
for
the
time
among
the
peas
and
beans
jack
carera
he
cried
looking
wildly
about
him
and
flourishing
with
his
stick
jack
they
are
going
to
kill
her
jack
jack
carera
i
say
he
repeated
where
is
jack
carera
call
him
somebody
they
are
going
to
kill
her
they
have
taken
my
child
a
prisoner
to
the
house
of
life
i
say
jack
jack
where
is
he
where
is
he
the
men
were
working
in
gangs
nobody
paid
the
least
heed
to
the
old
man
they
looked
up
saw
an
old
man
his
hat
blown
off
his
long
white
hair
waving
in
the
wind
brandishing
wildly
his
stick
and
shrieking
for
jack
then
they
went
on
with
their
work
it
was
no
business
of
theirs
docile
meek
and
unquestioning
are
the
people
by
accident
however
jack
was
within
hearing
and
presently
ran
across
the
field
what
is
it
he
cried
what
has
happened
they
have
taken
prisoner
the
old
man
gasped
the
the
arch
physician
and
lady
mildred
they
are
going
to
try
them
before
the
college
of
physicians
and
now
they
have
taken
my
girl
my
christine
and
they
will
try
her
too
they
will
try
them
all
and
they
will
kill
them
all
that
shall
be
seen
said
jack
a
fierce
look
in
his
eyes
go
back
to
the
museum
old
man
and
wait
for
me
keep
quiet
if
you
can
wait
for
me
in
half
an
hour
he
had
collected
together
the
whole
of
the
company
men
and
women
which
formed
their
party
they
were
thirty
in
number
and
they
came
in
from
work
in
the
regulation
dress
the
sailor
briefly
related
what
had
happened
now
he
said
before
we
do
anything
more
let
us
put
on
the
dress
of
the
nineteenth
century
that
will
help
us
to
remember
that
our
future
depends
upon
ourselves
and
will
put
heart
in
us
this
done
he
made
them
a
speech
first
he
reminded
them
how
by
the
help
of
one
girl
alone
the
memory
of
the
past
had
been
restored
to
them
next
he
bade
them
keep
in
their
minds
the
whole
of
that
past
every
portion
of
it
and
to
brace
up
their
courage
with
the
thought
of
it
how
delightful
and
desirable
it
was
and
then
he
exhorted
them
to
think
of
the
present
which
he
called
loathsome
shameful
vile
and
other
bad
names
we
are
in
the
gravest
crisis
of
our
fortunes
he
concluded
on
our
action
this
day
depends
our
whole
future
either
we
emerge
from
this
crisis
free
men
and
women
or
we
sink
back
into
the
present
dull
and
dismal
without
hope
and
without
thought
nay
there
is
more
if
we
do
not
rescue
ourselves
we
shall
be
very
speedily
finished
off
by
the
college
do
you
think
they
will
ever
forgive
us
not
so
as
they
deal
with
the
arch
physician
and
these
two
ladies
so
they
will
deal
with
us
better
so
better
a
thousand
times
to
suffer
death
at
once
than
to
fall
back
into
that
wretched
condition
to
which
we
were
reduced
what
you
who
have
learned
once
more
what
is
meant
by
love
will
you
give
that
up
will
you
give
up
these
secret
assemblies
where
we
revive
the
glorious
past
and
feel
again
the
old
thoughts
and
the
old
ambitions
never
swear
with
me
never
never
never
they
shouted
together
they
waved
their
hands
they
were
resolved
the
men
eyes
were
alive
again
in
short
they
were
back
again
to
the
past
of
their
young
days
first
said
jack
let
us
arm
he
led
them
to
a
part
of
the
museum
where
certain
old
weapons
stood
stacked
thanks
to
the
curator
and
to
christine
they
had
been
kept
bright
and
clear
from
rust
by
the
application
of
oil
here
are
swords
lances
rifles
but
we
have
no
ammunition
bayonets
let
us
take
the
rifles
and
bayonets
so
to
every
man
one
now
the
time
presses
the
trial
is
going
on
it
may
be
too
late
in
a
few
minutes
to
save
the
prisoners
let
us
resolve
two
plans
suggested
themselves
at
once
the
first
of
these
was
to
rush
before
the
house
of
life
break
open
the
gates
and
tear
the
prisoners
from
the
hands
of
the
judges
the
next
was
to
ascertain
somehow
what
was
being
done
the
former
counsel
prevailed
and
the
men
were
already
making
ready
for
the
attack
when
the
great
bell
of
the
house
began
to
toll
solemnly
what
is
that
cried
the
women
shuddering
it
went
on
tolling
at
regular
intervals
of
a
quarter
of
a
minute
it
was
the
knell
for
three
persons
about
to
die
then
the
doors
of
the
south
porch
flew
open
and
one
of
the
bedells
came
forth
what
does
that
mean
they
asked
the
bedell
walked
across
the
great
garden
and
began
to
ring
the
bell
of
the
public
hall
the
dinner
bell
instantly
the
people
began
to
flock
in
from
the
workshops
and
the
fields
from
all
quarters
in
obedience
to
a
summons
rarely
issued
they
flocked
in
slowly
and
without
the
least
animation
showing
not
the
faintest
interest
in
the
proceedings
no
doubt
there
was
something
or
other
it
mattered
not
what
ordered
by
the
college
go
somebody
cried
jack
go
hilda
he
turned
to
one
of
the
girls
slip
on
your
working
dress
run
and
find
out
what
is
being
done
oh
if
we
are
too
late
they
shall
pay
they
shall
pay
courage
men
here
are
fifteen
of
us
and
stout
we
are
equal
to
the
whole
of
that
coward
mob
run
hilda
run
hilda
pushed
her
way
through
the
crowd
what
is
it
she
asked
the
bedell
eagerly
what
has
happened
you
shall
hear
he
replied
the
most
dreadful
thing
that
can
happen
a
thing
that
has
not
happened
since
but
you
will
hear
he
waited
a
little
longer
until
all
seemed
to
be
assembled
then
he
stood
upon
a
and
lifted
up
his
voice
listen
listen
listen
he
cried
by
order
of
the
holy
college
listen
know
ye
all
that
for
his
crimes
and
treacheries
the
arch
physician
has
been
deposed
from
his
sacred
office
know
ye
all
that
he
is
condemned
to
die
there
was
here
a
slight
movement
a
shiver
as
of
a
wood
on
a
still
autumn
day
at
the
first
breath
of
the
wind
he
is
condemned
to
die
he
will
be
brought
out
without
delay
and
will
be
executed
in
the
sight
of
the
whole
people
here
they
trembled
there
are
also
condemned
with
him
as
accomplices
in
his
guilt
two
women
named
respectively
mildred
or
mildred
carera
in
the
old
style
and
the
girl
christine
listen
listen
listen
it
is
forbidden
to
any
either
to
leave
the
place
during
the
time
of
punishment
or
to
interfere
in
order
to
stay
punishment
or
in
any
way
to
move
or
meddle
in
the
matter
listen
listen
long
live
the
holy
college
with
that
he
descended
and
made
his
way
back
to
the
house
but
hilda
ran
to
the
museum
with
the
news
why
said
jack
what
could
happen
better
in
the
house
no
one
knows
what
devilry
of
electricity
and
stuff
they
may
have
ready
to
hand
here
in
the
open
we
can
defy
them
nothing
remains
but
to
wait
until
the
prisoners
are
brought
out
and
then
then
he
gasped
remember
what
we
were
geoffrey
you
wear
the
old
uniform
let
the
spirit
of
your
old
regiment
fire
your
heart
again
ay
ay
you
will
do
now
let
us
a
drill
a
little
and
practice
fighting
together
shoulder
to
shoulder
why
we
are
invincible
said
i
not
that
we
might
if
we
ever
regretted
anything
regret
that
we
did
not
lock
these
conspirators
in
the
museum
before
we
brought
out
our
prisoners
to
their
death
the
great
bell
of
the
house
tolled
the
people
stood
about
in
their
quiet
way
looking
on
apparently
unmoved
while
the
carpenters
quickly
hammered
together
a
scaffold
some
six
feet
high
well
i
confess
it
the
whole
business
was
a
mistake
the
people
were
gone
lower
down
than
i
had
ever
hoped
save
for
the
shudder
which
naturally
seized
them
on
mention
of
the
word
death
they
showed
no
sign
of
concern
if
even
then
i
had
gone
forth
to
see
how
they
took
it
i
might
have
reversed
the
order
and
carried
out
the
execution
within
they
wanted
no
lesson
their
past
if
it
were
once
revived
would
for
the
most
part
be
a
past
of
such
struggling
for
life
and
so
much
misery
that
it
was
not
likely
they
would
care
to
revive
it
better
the
daily
course
unchanged
unchangeable
yet
we
know
not
as
my
colleague
in
the
house
said
the
memory
is
perhaps
a
thing
indestructible
at
a
touch
at
a
flash
of
light
the
whole
of
their
minds
might
be
lit
up
again
and
the
emotions
remembered
and
restored
might
again
seem
what
once
they
seemed
worth
living
for
still
the
great
bell
tolled
and
the
carpenters
hammered
and
the
scaffold
strong
and
high
stood
waiting
for
the
criminals
and
on
the
scaffold
a
block
brought
from
the
butcher
shop
but
the
people
said
not
a
single
word
to
each
other
waiting
like
sheep
only
unlike
sheep
they
did
not
huddle
together
in
the
chamber
over
the
porch
the
prisoners
awaited
the
completion
of
the
preparations
and
in
the
museum
the
fifteen
conspirators
stood
waiting
armed
and
ready
for
their
deed
of
violence
chapter
xiii
the
execution
as
the
clock
struck
two
a
messenger
brought
the
news
that
the
preparations
were
complete
the
college
was
still
sitting
in
council
one
of
the
physicians
proposed
that
before
the
execution
the
arch
physician
should
be
brought
before
us
to
be
subjected
to
a
last
examination
i
saw
no
use
for
this
measure
but
i
did
not
oppose
it
and
presently
john
lax
armed
with
his
sharpened
axe
brought
the
prisoners
before
the
conclave
of
his
late
brethren
linister
i
said
before
we
start
upon
that
procession
from
which
you
will
not
return
have
you
any
communication
to
make
to
the
college
your
researches
they
are
all
in
order
properly
drawn
up
arranged
in
columns
and
indexed
he
replied
i
trust
they
will
prove
to
advance
the
cause
of
science
true
science
not
the
degradation
of
humanity
such
as
they
are
we
shall
use
them
i
replied
according
to
the
wisdom
of
the
college
is
there
anything
else
you
wish
to
communicate
are
there
ideas
in
your
brain
which
you
would
wish
to
write
down
before
you
die
remember
in
a
few
minutes
you
will
be
a
senseless
lump
of
clay
rolling
round
and
round
the
world
forever
like
all
the
other
lumps
which
form
the
crust
of
the
earth
i
have
nothing
more
to
communicate
perhaps
suffragan
you
are
wrong
about
the
senseless
lumps
of
clay
and
now
if
you
please
do
not
delay
the
end
longer
for
the
sake
of
those
poor
girls
waiting
in
suspense
i
could
have
wished
more
outward
show
of
horror
prayers
for
forgiveness
no
linister
was
always
in
his
own
mind
an
aristocrat
the
aristocratic
spirit
how
it
survives
even
after
the
whole
of
the
past
might
have
been
supposed
to
be
forgotten
well
he
was
a
tall
and
manly
man
and
he
looked
a
born
leader
a
good
many
of
them
in
the
old
days
used
to
have
that
look
for
my
own
part
i
am
short
and
black
of
face
no
one
would
call
me
a
leader
born
but
i
deposed
the
aristocrat
and
as
for
him
what
has
become
of
him
what
would
you
have
done
for
the
people
i
asked
him
that
would
have
been
better
for
them
than
forgetfulness
and
freedom
from
pain
and
anxiety
you
have
always
opposed
the
majority
tell
us
at
this
supreme
moment
what
you
would
have
done
for
them
i
know
not
now
he
replied
a
month
ago
i
should
have
told
you
that
i
would
have
revived
the
ancient
order
i
would
have
given
the
good
things
of
the
world
to
them
who
were
strong
enough
to
win
them
in
the
struggle
hard
work
bad
food
low
condition
should
have
been
as
it
used
to
be
the
lot
of
the
incompetent
i
would
have
recognized
in
women
their
instinct
for
fine
dress
i
would
have
encouraged
the
revival
of
love
i
would
have
restored
the
arts
but
now
now
now
i
said
that
you
have
begun
to
make
the
attempt
you
recognize
at
last
that
there
is
nothing
better
for
them
all
than
forgetfulness
and
freedom
from
anxiety
struggle
and
thought
not
so
he
replied
not
at
all
i
understand
that
unless
the
spirit
of
man
mounts
higher
continually
the
earthly
things
must
grow
stale
and
tedious
and
so
must
perish
yea
all
the
things
which
once
we
thought
so
beautiful
music
art
letters
philosophy
love
society
they
must
all
wither
and
perish
if
life
be
prolonged
unless
the
spirit
is
borne
continually
upward
and
this
we
have
not
tried
to
effect
the
spirit
of
man
i
thought
that
old
superstition
was
cleared
away
and
done
with
long
ago
i
have
never
found
the
spirit
in
my
laboratory
have
you
no
i
have
not
that
is
not
the
place
to
find
it
well
since
you
have
changed
your
mind
with
us
the
spirit
of
man
has
been
sinking
lower
and
lower
till
it
is
clean
forgotten
man
now
lives
for
himself
alone
the
triumph
of
science
suffragan
is
yours
no
more
death
no
more
pain
no
more
ambition
equality
absolute
and
the
ultimate
lump
of
human
flesh
incorruptible
breathing
sleeping
absorbing
food
living
science
can
do
no
more
i
am
glad
even
at
this
last
moment
to
receive
this
submission
of
your
opinions
but
he
said
his
eye
flashing
remember
the
spirit
of
man
only
sleeps
it
doth
not
die
such
an
awakening
as
you
have
witnessed
among
a
few
of
us
will
some
day
by
an
accident
by
a
trick
of
memory
how
do
i
know
by
a
dream
fly
through
the
heads
of
these
poor
helpless
sheep
and
turn
them
again
into
men
and
women
who
will
rend
you
now
take
me
away
it
is
pleasant
to
my
i
say
to
record
that
one
who
was
so
great
an
inquirer
into
the
secrets
of
nature
should
at
such
a
moment
give
way
and
confess
that
i
was
right
in
my
administration
of
the
people
pity
that
he
should
talk
the
old
nonsense
why
i
learned
to
despise
it
in
the
old
days
when
i
was
a
boy
and
listened
to
the
fiery
orators
of
the
whitechapel
road
the
procession
was
formed
it
was
like
that
of
the
daily
march
to
the
public
hall
with
certain
changes
one
of
them
was
that
the
arch
physician
now
walked
in
the
middle
instead
of
at
the
end
he
was
no
more
clothed
in
the
robes
of
office
but
in
the
strange
and
unbecoming
garb
in
which
he
was
arrested
before
him
walked
the
two
women
they
held
a
book
between
them
brought
out
of
the
library
by
christine
and
one
of
them
read
aloud
it
was
i
believe
part
of
the
incantation
or
fetish
worship
of
the
old
time
and
as
they
read
the
tears
rolled
down
their
cheeks
yet
they
did
not
seem
to
be
afraid
before
the
prisoners
marched
john
lax
bearing
the
dreadful
axe
which
he
had
now
polished
until
it
was
like
a
mirror
or
a
laboratory
tool
for
brightness
and
on
his
face
there
still
shone
the
honest
satisfaction
of
one
whose
heart
is
joyed
to
execute
punishment
upon
traitors
he
showed
this
joy
in
a
manner
perhaps
unseemly
to
the
gravity
of
the
occasion
grinning
as
he
walked
and
feeling
the
edge
of
the
axe
with
his
fingers
the
way
seemed
long
i
for
one
was
anxious
to
get
the
business
over
and
done
with
i
was
oppressed
by
certain
fears
or
doubts
as
if
something
would
happen
along
the
way
on
either
side
stood
the
people
ranged
in
order
silent
dutiful
stupid
i
scanned
their
faces
narrowly
as
i
walked
in
most
there
was
not
a
gleam
of
intelligence
they
understood
nothing
here
and
there
a
face
which
showed
a
spark
of
uneasiness
or
terror
for
the
most
part
nothing
i
began
to
understand
that
we
had
made
a
blunder
in
holding
a
public
execution
if
it
was
meant
to
impress
the
people
it
failed
to
do
so
that
was
certain
so
far
what
happened
immediately
afterwards
did
however
impress
them
as
much
as
they
could
be
impressed
immediately
in
front
of
the
public
hall
stood
the
scaffold
it
was
about
six
feet
high
with
a
low
round
it
and
it
was
draped
in
black
the
block
stood
in
the
middle
it
was
arranged
that
the
executioner
should
first
mount
the
scaffold
alone
there
to
await
the
criminals
the
college
of
physicians
were
to
sit
in
a
semicircle
of
seats
arranged
for
them
on
one
side
of
it
the
bedells
standing
behind
them
the
assistants
of
the
college
were
arranged
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
scaffold
the
first
to
suffer
was
to
be
the
girl
christine
the
second
the
woman
mildred
last
the
greatest
criminal
of
the
three
the
arch
physician
himself
the
first
part
of
the
programme
was
perfectly
carried
out
john
lax
clothed
in
red
big
and
burly
his
red
face
glowing
stood
on
the
scaffold
beside
the
block
leaning
on
the
dreadful
axe
the
sacred
college
were
seated
in
their
places
the
bedells
stood
behind
them
the
assistants
sat
on
the
other
side
the
prisoners
stood
before
the
college
so
far
all
went
well
then
i
rose
and
read
in
a
loud
voice
the
crimes
which
had
been
committed
and
the
sentence
of
the
court
when
i
concluded
i
looked
around
there
was
a
vast
sea
of
heads
before
me
in
the
midst
i
observed
some
kind
of
commotion
as
of
people
who
were
pushing
to
the
front
it
was
in
the
direction
of
the
museum
but
this
i
hardly
noticed
my
mind
being
full
of
the
example
which
was
about
to
be
made
as
for
the
immobility
of
the
people
faces
it
was
something
truly
wonderful
let
the
woman
christine
i
cried
mount
the
scaffold
and
meet
her
doom
the
girl
threw
herself
into
the
arms
of
the
other
woman
and
they
kissed
each
other
then
she
tore
herself
away
and
the
next
moment
she
would
have
mounted
the
steps
and
knelt
before
the
block
but
the
confusion
which
had
sprung
up
in
the
direction
of
the
museum
increased
suddenly
to
a
tumult
right
and
left
the
people
parted
flying
and
shrieking
and
there
came
running
through
the
lane
thus
formed
a
company
of
men
dressed
in
fantastic
garments
of
various
colors
armed
with
ancient
weapons
and
crying
aloud
to
the
rescue
to
the
rescue
then
i
sprang
to
my
feet
amazed
was
it
possible
could
it
be
possible
that
the
holy
college
of
physicians
should
be
actually
defied
it
was
possible
more
it
was
exactly
what
these
wretched
persons
proposed
to
dare
and
to
do
as
for
what
followed
it
took
but
a
moment
the
men
burst
into
the
circle
thus
armed
and
thus
determined
we
all
sprang
to
our
feet
and
recoiled
but
there
was
one
who
met
them
with
equal
courage
and
defiance
had
there
been
but
how
could
there
be
any
more
we
should
have
made
a
wholesome
example
of
the
rebels
john
lax
was
this
one
he
leaped
from
the
scaffold
with
a
roar
like
a
lion
and
threw
himself
upon
the
men
who
advanced
swinging
his
heavy
axe
around
him
as
if
it
had
been
a
no
wild
beast
deprived
of
its
prey
could
have
presented
such
a
terrible
appearance
baffled
revenge
rage
the
thirst
for
battle
all
showed
themselves
in
this
giant
as
he
turned
a
fearless
front
to
his
enemies
and
swung
his
terrible
axe
i
thought
the
rebels
would
have
run
they
wavered
they
fell
back
then
at
a
word
from
their
leader
it
was
none
other
than
the
dangerous
man
the
sailor
called
jack
or
john
carera
they
closed
in
and
stood
shoulder
to
shoulder
every
man
holding
his
weapon
in
readiness
they
were
armed
with
the
ancient
weapon
called
the
rifle
with
a
bayonet
thrust
in
at
the
end
of
it
close
in
my
men
stand
firm
shouted
the
sailor
leave
john
lax
to
me
ho
ho
john
lax
you
and
i
will
fight
this
out
i
know
you
you
were
the
spy
who
did
the
mischief
come
on
stand
firm
my
men
and
if
i
fall
make
a
speedy
end
of
this
spy
and
rescue
the
prisoners
he
sprang
to
the
front
and
for
a
moment
the
two
men
confronted
each
other
then
john
lax
with
another
roar
swung
his
axe
had
it
descended
upon
the
sailor
head
there
would
have
been
an
end
of
him
but
i
know
little
of
fighting
but
it
is
certain
that
the
fellow
was
a
coward
for
he
actually
leaped
lightly
back
and
dodged
the
blow
then
when
the
axe
had
swung
round
so
as
to
leave
his
adversary
side
in
a
defenceless
position
this
disgraceful
coward
leaped
forward
and
took
a
shameful
advantage
of
this
accident
and
drove
his
bayonet
up
to
the
hilt
in
the
unfortunate
executioner
body
john
lax
dropped
his
axe
threw
up
his
arms
and
fell
heavily
backwards
he
was
dead
he
was
killed
instantaneously
anything
more
terrible
more
murderous
more
cowardly
i
never
witnessed
i
know
i
say
little
of
fighting
and
war
but
this
i
must
always
maintain
was
a
foul
blow
john
lax
had
aimed
his
stroke
and
missed
it
is
true
owing
to
the
cowardly
leap
of
his
enemy
out
of
the
way
but
in
the
name
of
common
fairness
his
adversary
should
have
permitted
him
to
resume
his
fighting
position
as
it
was
he
only
waited
cowardly
till
the
heavy
axe
swinging
round
exposed
john
side
and
then
stepped
in
and
took
his
advantage
this
i
call
murder
and
not
war
john
lax
was
quite
dead
our
brave
and
zealous
servant
was
dead
he
lay
on
his
back
there
was
a
little
pool
of
blood
on
the
ground
his
clothes
were
stained
with
blood
his
face
was
already
white
was
it
possible
our
servant
the
sacred
servant
of
the
holy
house
was
dead
he
had
been
killed
a
servant
of
the
holy
college
had
been
killed
what
next
what
dreadful
thing
would
follow
and
the
criminals
were
rescued
by
this
time
we
were
all
standing
bewildered
horrified
in
an
undignified
crowd
fellows
and
assistants
together
then
i
spoke
but
i
fear
in
a
trembling
voice
men
i
said
know
you
what
you
do
go
back
to
the
place
whence
you
came
and
await
the
punishment
due
to
your
crime
back
i
say
form
in
square
ordered
the
murderer
paying
no
heed
at
all
to
my
commands
the
rebels
arranged
themselves
as
if
they
had
rehearsed
the
thing
for
weeks
every
man
with
his
weapon
ready
five
on
a
side
forming
three
sides
of
a
square
of
which
the
scaffold
formed
the
fourth
within
the
square
stood
the
three
prisoners
o
jack
cried
christine
we
never
dreamed
of
this
o
harry
murmured
mildred
falling
into
the
arms
of
the
rescued
linister
at
such
a
moment
the
first
thing
they
thought
of
was
this
love
and
yet
there
are
some
who
have
maintained
that
human
nature
could
have
been
continued
by
science
on
the
old
lines
folly
at
the
bottom
of
everything
folly
and
vanity
sir
the
sailor
man
addressed
linister
you
are
now
our
chief
take
this
sword
and
the
command
he
threw
a
crimson
sash
over
the
shoulders
of
him
who
but
a
minute
before
was
waiting
to
be
executed
and
placed
in
his
hands
a
drawn
sword
then
the
chief
i
am
bound
to
say
that
he
looked
as
if
he
were
born
to
command
mounted
the
scaffold
and
looked
round
with
eyes
of
authority
let
the
poor
people
be
dismissed
he
said
bid
them
disperse
go
home
go
to
walk
and
to
rest
or
sleep
or
anything
that
is
left
in
the
unhappy
blank
that
we
call
their
mind
then
he
turned
to
the
college
there
were
some
among
you
my
former
brethren
he
said
who
in
times
past
were
friends
of
my
own
you
voted
with
me
against
the
degradation
of
the
people
but
in
vain
we
have
often
communed
together
on
the
insufficiency
of
science
and
the
unwisdom
of
the
modern
methods
come
out
from
the
college
my
friends
and
join
us
we
have
the
great
secret
and
we
have
all
the
knowledge
of
science
that
there
is
cast
in
your
lot
with
mine
five
or
six
of
the
fellows
stepped
forth
they
were
those
who
had
always
voted
for
the
arch
physician
among
them
was
the
man
who
had
spoken
on
the
uncertainty
of
memory
these
were
admitted
within
the
line
of
armed
men
nay
their
gowns
of
office
were
taken
from
them
and
they
presently
received
weapons
about
twenty
or
thirty
of
the
assistants
also
fell
out
and
were
admitted
to
the
ranks
of
the
rebels
there
come
no
more
asked
the
chief
well
choose
for
yourselves
captain
heron
make
the
crowd
stand
back
clear
them
away
with
the
butt
ends
of
your
rifles
if
they
will
not
go
when
they
are
told
so
now
let
the
rest
of
the
college
return
to
the
house
captain
carera
take
ten
men
and
drive
them
back
let
the
first
who
stops
or
endeavors
to
make
the
others
stop
or
attempts
to
address
the
people
be
run
through
as
you
despatched
the
man
john
lax
fellows
and
assistants
of
the
college
back
to
the
place
whence
you
came
back
as
quickly
as
may
be
or
it
will
be
the
worse
for
you
the
ten
men
stepped
out
with
lowered
bayonets
we
saw
them
approaching
with
murder
in
their
eyes
and
we
turned
and
fled
it
was
not
a
retreat
it
was
a
run
one
over
the
other
if
one
fell
the
savage
rebels
prodded
him
in
fleshy
parts
and
roared
with
laughter
fellows
assistants
and
bedells
alike
we
fell
over
each
other
elbowing
and
fighting
until
we
found
ourselves
at
last
some
with
bleeding
noses
some
with
black
eyes
some
with
broken
ribs
all
with
torn
gowns
within
the
house
of
life
the
rebels
stood
outside
the
south
porch
laughing
at
our
discomfiture
wardens
of
the
great
secret
said
captain
carera
you
have
no
longer
any
secret
to
guard
meantime
until
the
pleasure
of
the
chief
and
the
sentence
of
the
court
is
pronounced
remember
he
who
endeavors
to
escape
from
the
house
will
assuredly
meet
his
death
think
of
john
lax
and
do
not
dare
to
resist
the
authority
of
the
army
then
he
shut
the
door
upon
us
and
locked
it
and
we
heard
the
footsteps
of
the
men
as
they
marched
away
in
order
this
then
was
the
result
of
my
most
fatal
error
had
we
as
we
might
so
easily
have
done
executed
our
prisoners
in
the
house
itself
and
locked
up
the
rebels
in
the
museum
these
evils
would
not
have
happened
it
is
futile
to
regret
the
past
which
can
never
be
undone
but
it
is
impossible
not
to
regret
a
blunder
which
produced
such
fatal
results
chapter
xiv
prisoners
thus
then
were
the
tables
turned
upon
us
we
were
locked
up
prisoners
actually
the
sacred
college
prisoners
in
the
house
of
life
itself
and
the
great
secret
was
probably
by
this
time
in
the
hands
of
the
rebels
to
whom
the
arch
traitor
had
no
doubt
given
it
as
he
had
proposed
to
do
when
we
arrested
him
lost
to
us
forever
what
would
become
of
the
college
when
the
great
mystery
was
lost
to
it
where
would
be
its
dignity
where
its
authority
the
first
question
we
read
it
in
each
other
eyes
without
asking
it
was
however
not
what
would
become
of
our
authority
but
of
ourselves
what
were
they
going
to
do
with
us
they
had
killed
the
unfortunate
john
lax
solely
because
he
stood
up
manfully
for
the
college
what
could
we
expect
besides
we
had
fully
intended
to
kill
the
rebels
now
we
were
penned
up
like
fowls
in
a
coop
altogether
at
their
mercy
could
one
have
believed
that
the
holy
college
the
source
of
health
the
maintainer
of
life
would
ever
have
been
driven
to
its
house
as
to
a
prison
like
a
herd
of
swine
to
their
sty
made
to
run
head
over
heels
tumbling
over
one
another
without
dignity
or
shoved
bundled
cuffed
and
kicked
into
the
house
of
life
and
locked
up
with
the
promise
of
instant
death
to
any
who
should
endeavor
to
escape
but
did
they
mean
to
kill
us
that
was
the
question
before
us
why
should
they
not
we
should
have
killed
the
arch
physician
had
they
suffered
it
and
now
they
had
all
the
power
i
confess
that
the
thought
of
this
probability
filled
my
mind
with
so
great
a
terror
that
the
more
i
thought
of
it
the
more
my
teeth
chattered
and
my
knees
knocked
together
nay
the
very
tears
the
first
since
i
was
a
little
boy
came
into
my
eyes
in
thinking
that
i
must
abandon
my
laboratory
and
all
my
researches
almost
at
the
very
moment
when
the
triumph
of
science
was
well
within
my
grasp
and
i
was
ready
nearly
to
present
mankind
at
his
last
and
best
but
at
this
juncture
the
assistants
showed
by
their
behavior
and
their
carriage
now
greatly
wanting
in
respect
that
they
looked
to
us
for
aid
and
i
hastily
called
together
the
remaining
fellows
in
the
inner
house
we
took
our
places
and
looked
at
each
other
in
dismay
which
could
not
be
concealed
brothers
i
said
because
they
looked
to
me
for
speech
it
can
not
be
denied
that
the
situation
is
full
of
danger
never
before
has
the
college
been
in
danger
so
imminent
at
this
very
instant
they
may
be
sending
armed
soldiers
to
murder
us
at
this
moment
there
happened
to
be
a
movement
of
many
feet
in
the
nave
and
it
seemed
as
if
the
thing
was
actually
upon
us
i
sat
down
pale
and
trembling
the
others
did
the
same
it
was
several
minutes
before
confidence
was
so
far
restored
that
we
could
speak
coherently
we
have
lived
so
long
i
said
and
we
have
known
so
long
the
pleasure
of
scientific
research
that
the
mere
thought
of
death
fills
us
with
apprehensions
that
the
common
people
can
not
guess
our
superior
nature
makes
us
doubly
sensitive
perhaps
let
us
hope
they
may
not
kill
us
perhaps
they
may
make
demands
upon
us
to
which
we
can
yield
they
will
certainly
turn
us
out
of
the
college
and
house
of
life
and
install
themselves
unless
we
find
a
way
to
turn
the
tables
but
we
may
buy
our
lives
we
may
even
become
their
assistants
our
knowledge
may
be
placed
at
their
disposal
yes
yes
they
all
agreed
life
before
everything
we
will
yield
to
any
conditions
the
great
secret
has
gone
out
of
our
keeping
i
went
on
linister
has
probably
communicated
it
to
all
alike
there
goes
the
whole
authority
the
whole
mystery
of
the
college
we
are
ruined
echoed
the
fellows
in
dismay
half
a
dozen
of
our
fellows
have
gone
over
too
there
is
not
now
a
secret
or
a
scientific
discovery
or
a
process
concerning
life
food
health
or
disease
that
they
do
not
know
as
well
as
ourselves
and
they
have
all
the
power
what
will
they
do
with
it
what
can
we
do
to
get
it
out
of
their
hands
then
began
a
babel
of
suggestions
and
ideas
unfortunately
every
plan
proposed
involved
the
necessity
of
some
one
risking
or
losing
his
life
in
the
old
times
when
there
were
always
men
risking
and
losing
their
lives
for
some
cause
or
other
i
suppose
there
would
have
been
no
difficulty
at
all
i
had
been
accustomed
to
laugh
at
this
foolish
sacrifice
of
one
self
since
there
is
but
one
life
for
pay
or
for
the
good
of
others
now
however
i
confess
that
we
should
have
found
it
most
convenient
if
we
could
have
persuaded
some
to
risk
very
likely
they
would
not
actually
have
lost
their
lives
for
the
sake
of
the
holy
college
for
instance
the
first
plan
that
occurred
to
us
was
this
we
numbered
even
after
the
late
defections
two
hundred
strong
in
the
college
this
army
of
the
rebels
could
not
be
more
than
seventy
counting
the
deserters
from
the
college
why
should
we
not
break
open
the
doors
and
sally
forth
a
hundred
two
hundred
strong
armed
with
weapons
from
the
laboratory
provided
with
bottles
of
nitric
and
sulphuric
acid
and
fall
upon
the
rebel
army
suddenly
while
they
were
unprepared
for
us
this
plan
so
far
carried
me
away
that
i
called
together
the
whole
of
the
college
assistants
bedells
and
all
and
laid
it
before
them
i
pointed
out
that
the
overwhelming
nature
of
the
force
we
could
hurl
upon
the
enemy
would
cause
so
great
a
terror
to
fall
upon
them
that
they
would
instantly
drop
their
arms
and
fly
as
fast
as
they
could
run
when
our
men
would
have
nothing
more
to
do
but
to
run
after
and
kill
them
the
men
looked
at
one
another
with
doubtful
eyes
finally
one
impudent
rascal
said
that
as
the
physicians
themselves
had
most
to
lose
they
should
themselves
lead
the
assault
we
will
follow
the
suffragan
and
the
fellows
he
said
i
endeavored
to
make
them
understand
that
the
most
valuable
lives
should
always
be
preserved
until
the
last
but
in
this
i
failed
the
idea
therefore
of
a
sortie
in
force
had
to
be
abandoned
it
was
next
proposed
that
we
should
dig
a
tunnel
under
the
public
hall
and
blow
up
the
rebels
with
some
of
the
old
explosives
but
to
dig
a
tunnel
takes
time
and
then
who
would
risk
his
life
with
the
explosive
it
was
further
proposed
to
send
out
a
deputation
of
two
or
three
who
should
preach
to
the
rebels
and
point
out
the
terrible
consequences
of
their
continued
mutiny
but
this
appeared
impracticable
for
the
simple
reason
that
no
one
could
be
found
to
brave
the
threat
of
captain
carera
of
death
to
any
who
ventured
out
besides
it
was
pointed
out
with
some
reason
that
if
our
messengers
were
suffered
to
reach
the
rebels
no
one
would
be
moved
by
the
threats
of
helpless
prisoners
unable
to
effect
their
own
release
as
for
what
was
proposed
to
be
done
with
electricity
dynamite
and
so
forth
i
pass
all
that
over
in
a
word
we
found
that
we
could
do
nothing
we
were
prisoners
then
an
idea
occurred
to
me
i
remembered
how
many
years
before
linister
who
had
always
a
mind
full
of
resource
and
ingenuity
made
a
discovery
by
means
of
which
one
man
armed
with
a
single
weapon
easy
to
carry
could
annihilate
a
whole
army
if
war
had
continued
in
the
world
this
weapon
would
have
put
an
immediate
stop
to
it
but
war
ceased
and
it
was
never
used
now
i
thought
if
i
could
find
that
weapon
or
any
account
or
drawing
of
its
manufacture
i
should
be
able
from
the
commanding
height
of
the
tower
with
my
own
hand
to
annihilate
linister
and
all
his
following
i
proceeded
with
the
assistance
of
the
whole
college
to
hunt
among
the
volumes
of
researches
and
experiments
there
were
thousands
of
them
we
spent
many
days
in
the
search
but
we
found
it
not
when
we
were
tired
of
the
search
we
would
climb
up
into
the
tower
and
look
out
upon
the
scene
below
which
was
full
of
activity
and
bustle
oh
if
we
could
only
by
simply
pointing
the
weapon
only
by
pressing
a
knob
see
our
enemies
swiftly
and
suddenly
overwhelmed
by
death
but
we
could
not
find
that
discovery
anywhere
there
were
whole
rows
of
volumes
which
consisted
of
nothing
but
indexes
but
we
could
not
find
it
in
any
of
them
and
so
this
hope
failed
they
did
not
kill
us
every
day
they
opened
the
doors
and
called
for
men
to
come
forth
and
fetch
food
but
they
did
not
kill
us
yet
the
danger
was
ever
present
in
our
minds
after
a
week
the
college
resolved
that
since
one
alone
of
the
body
knew
the
great
secret
that
one
being
the
most
likely
to
be
selected
for
execution
if
there
were
any
such
step
taken
it
was
expedient
that
the
secret
should
be
revealed
to
the
whole
college
i
protested
but
had
to
obey
to
part
with
that
secret
was
like
parting
with
all
my
power
i
was
no
longer
invested
with
the
sanctity
of
one
who
held
that
secret
the
suffragan
became
a
simple
fellow
of
the
college
he
was
henceforth
only
one
of
those
who
conducted
researches
into
health
and
food
and
the
like
this
suspense
and
imprisonment
lasted
for
three
weeks
then
the
rebels
as
you
shall
hear
did
the
most
wonderful
and
most
unexpected
thing
in
the
world
why
they
did
it
when
they
had
the
house
of
life
the
college
and
all
in
their
own
hands
and
could
have
established
themselves
there
and
done
whatever
they
pleased
with
the
people
i
have
never
been
able
to
understand
chapter
xv
the
recruiting
sergeant
when
the
college
had
thus
ignominiously
been
driven
into
the
house
and
the
key
turned
upon
us
the
rebels
looked
at
each
other
with
the
greatest
satisfaction
so
far
said
jack
we
have
succeeded
beyond
our
greatest
hopes
the
prisoners
are
rescued
the
only
man
with
any
fight
in
him
has
been
put
out
of
the
temptation
to
fight
any
more
the
holy
college
are
made
prisoners
ourselves
are
masters
of
the
field
and
certain
to
remain
so
and
the
people
are
like
lambs
nothing
to
be
feared
from
them
nothing
apparently
to
be
hoped
they
had
been
reduced
to
terror
by
the
violence
of
the
rebels
in
pushing
through
them
they
had
rushed
away
screaming
those
of
them
who
witnessed
the
horrible
murder
of
john
lax
were
also
seized
with
panic
and
fled
but
when
no
more
terrifying
things
befell
they
speedily
relapsed
into
their
habitual
indifference
and
crept
back
again
as
if
nothing
had
happened
at
all
to
dawdle
away
their
time
in
the
sunshine
and
upon
the
garden
benches
every
man
alone
as
usual
that
the
holy
college
were
prisoners
that
rebels
had
usurped
the
authority
affected
them
not
a
whit
even
if
they
understood
it
my
administration
had
been
even
too
successful
one
could
no
longer
look
to
the
people
for
anything
they
were
now
even
more
rapidly
than
i
had
thought
possible
passing
into
the
last
stages
of
human
existence
ye
gods
cried
linister
swearing
in
the
language
of
the
past
and
by
the
shadows
long
forgotten
ye
gods
how
stupid
they
have
become
i
knew
not
that
they
were
so
far
gone
can
nothing
move
them
they
have
seen
a
victorious
rebellion
a
revolution
not
without
bloodshed
but
they
pay
no
heed
will
nothing
move
them
will
words
call
some
of
them
together
jack
drive
them
here
let
us
try
to
speak
to
them
it
may
be
that
i
shall
touch
some
chord
which
will
recall
the
past
it
was
thus
that
you
we
were
all
awakened
from
that
deadly
torpor
being
thus
summoned
the
people
men
and
women
flocked
about
the
scaffold
now
stripped
of
its
black
draperies
and
listened
while
linister
harangued
them
they
were
told
to
stand
and
listen
and
they
obeyed
without
a
gleam
in
their
patient
faces
to
show
that
they
understood
i
can
do
no
more
cried
linister
after
of
an
hour
he
had
drawn
a
skilful
and
moving
picture
of
the
past
he
had
depicted
its
glories
and
its
joys
compared
with
the
dismal
realities
of
the
present
he
dwelt
upon
their
loveless
and
passionless
existence
he
showed
them
how
they
were
gradually
sinking
lower
and
lower
that
they
would
soon
lose
the
intelligence
necessary
even
for
the
daily
task
then
he
asked
them
if
they
would
join
his
friends
and
himself
in
the
new
life
which
they
were
about
to
begin
it
should
be
full
of
all
the
old
things
endeavor
struggle
ambition
and
love
they
should
be
alive
not
half
dead
more
he
said
a
great
deal
more
but
to
no
purpose
if
they
showed
any
intelligence
at
all
it
was
terror
at
the
thought
of
change
linister
descended
it
is
no
use
he
said
will
you
try
jack
not
by
speaking
but
i
will
try
another
plan
he
disappeared
and
presently
came
back
again
having
visited
the
cellars
behind
the
public
halls
after
him
came
servants
rolling
barrels
and
casks
at
his
direction
i
am
going
to
try
the
effect
of
a
good
drink
said
jack
in
the
old
days
they
were
always
getting
drunk
and
the
trades
had
each
their
favorite
liquor
it
is
now
no
one
knows
how
long
since
these
poor
fellows
have
had
to
become
sober
because
they
could
no
longer
exceed
their
ration
let
us
encourage
them
to
get
drunk
i
am
sure
that
ought
to
touch
a
chord
this
disgraceful
idea
was
actually
carried
out
drink
of
all
kinds
spirits
beer
and
every
sort
of
intoxicating
liquor
were
brought
forth
and
the
men
were
invited
to
sit
down
and
drink
freely
after
the
manner
of
the
old
time
when
they
saw
the
casks
brought
out
and
placed
on
stands
each
ready
with
its
spigot
and
beside
the
casks
the
tables
and
benches
spread
for
them
on
the
benches
pipes
and
tobacco
gleams
of
intelligence
seemed
to
steal
into
their
eyes
come
said
jack
sit
down
my
friends
sit
down
all
of
you
now
then
what
will
you
drink
what
shall
it
be
call
for
what
you
like
best
here
is
a
barrel
of
beer
here
is
stout
here
are
gin
whiskey
rum
hollands
and
brandy
what
will
you
have
call
for
what
you
please
take
your
pipes
why
it
is
the
old
time
over
again
they
looked
at
each
other
stupidly
the
very
names
of
these
drinks
had
been
long
forgotten
by
them
but
they
presently
accepted
the
invitation
and
began
to
drink
greedily
at
seven
when
the
supper
bell
rang
there
were
at
least
three
hundred
men
lying
about
in
various
stages
of
drunkenness
some
were
fast
asleep
stretched
at
their
full
length
on
the
ground
some
lay
with
their
heads
on
the
table
some
sat
clutching
at
the
pewter
mugs
some
were
vacuously
laughing
or
noisily
singing
what
do
you
make
of
your
experiment
asked
linister
have
you
struck
your
chord
well
they
have
done
once
more
what
they
used
to
do
said
jack
despondently
and
they
have
done
it
in
the
same
old
way
i
think
there
could
ever
have
been
any
real
jolliness
about
the
dogs
who
got
drunk
as
fast
as
ever
they
could
i
expected
a
more
gradual
business
i
thought
the
drink
would
first
unloose
their
tongues
and
set
them
talking
then
i
hoped
that
they
would
in
this
way
be
led
to
remember
the
past
and
i
thought
that
directly
they
began
to
show
any
recollection
at
all
i
would
knock
off
the
supply
and
carry
on
the
memory
but
the
experiment
has
failed
unless
here
a
gleam
of
hope
shone
in
his
face
hot
coppers
prove
a
sensation
so
unusual
as
to
revive
the
memory
of
their
last
experience
in
the
same
direction
never
mind
how
many
years
ago
hot
coppers
produce
that
result
he
ordered
the
casks
to
be
rolled
back
to
the
cellars
that
evening
the
rebels
headed
by
linister
all
dressed
in
scarlet
and
gold
with
swords
and
with
them
the
ladies
they
were
called
ladies
now
nothing
less
not
women
of
the
people
any
more
came
to
the
public
hall
dressed
for
the
evening
in
strange
garments
with
bracelets
necklaces
jewels
gloves
and
things
which
most
of
the
people
had
never
seen
but
they
seemed
to
take
no
heed
of
these
things
they
are
hopeless
said
jack
nothing
moves
them
we
shall
have
to
begin
our
new
life
with
our
own
company
of
thirty
leave
them
to
us
said
mildred
remember
it
was
by
dress
that
christine
aroused
us
from
our
stagnant
condition
and
it
was
by
us
that
you
men
were
first
awakened
leave
them
to
us
after
the
evening
meal
the
ladies
went
about
from
table
to
table
talking
to
the
women
many
of
these
who
had
belonged
to
the
working
classes
in
the
old
time
and
had
no
recollection
at
all
of
fine
dress
looked
stupidly
at
the
ladies
dainty
attire
but
there
were
others
whose
faces
seemed
to
show
possibilities
of
other
things
and
to
these
the
ladies
addressed
themselves
first
they
asked
them
to
look
at
their
fine
frocks
and
bangles
and
things
and
next
if
any
admiration
was
awakened
they
begged
them
to
take
off
their
flat
caps
and
to
let
down
their
hair
some
of
them
consented
and
laughed
with
pride
in
showing
off
their
beauty
then
the
ladies
tied
ribbons
round
their
necks
and
waists
put
flowers
into
their
hair
and
made
them
look
in
the
glass
not
one
of
those
who
laughed
and
looked
in
the
glass
but
followed
the
ladies
that
evening
to
the
museum
they
came
a
company
of
recruits
fifty
strong
all
girls
and
then
the
whole
evening
was
devoted
to
bringing
back
the
past
it
came
quickly
enough
to
most
to
some
a
sad
past
full
of
hard
underpaid
work
to
some
a
past
of
enforced
idleness
to
some
a
past
of
work
and
pay
and
contentment
they
were
shopgirls
barmaids
all
kinds
of
girls
to
every
one
was
given
a
pretty
and
becoming
dress
not
one
but
was
rejoiced
at
the
prospect
of
changing
the
calm
and
quiet
present
for
the
emotions
and
the
struggles
of
the
past
but
they
were
not
allowed
to
rest
idle
next
day
these
girls
again
with
the
ladies
went
out
and
tried
the
effect
of
their
new
dress
and
their
beauty
upon
other
women
first
and
the
men
afterwards
as
they
went
about
lightly
and
gracefully
singing
laughing
daintily
dressed
many
of
the
men
began
to
lift
up
their
sleepy
eyes
and
to
look
after
them
and
when
the
girls
saw
these
symptoms
they
laid
siege
to
such
a
man
two
or
three
together
or
perhaps
one
alone
would
undertake
the
task
if
he
was
more
than
commonly
susceptible
as
for
those
on
whom
bright
eyes
smiles
laughter
and
pretty
dresses
produced
no
effect
they
let
them
alone
altogether
but
still
recruits
came
in
fast
every
night
they
did
all
in
their
power
to
make
the
past
live
again
they
played
the
old
comedies
melodramas
and
farces
in
the
public
hall
they
sang
the
old
songs
they
encouraged
the
recruits
to
sing
they
gave
the
men
tobacco
and
beer
they
had
dances
and
music
every
morning
the
original
company
of
rebels
sat
in
council
every
afternoon
the
recruits
dressed
like
soldiers
of
the
past
were
drawn
up
drilled
and
put
through
all
kinds
of
bodily
exercise
we
were
prisoners
i
said
for
three
weeks
one
morning
at
the
end
of
that
time
a
message
came
to
us
from
the
headquarters
of
the
army
this
was
now
their
official
style
and
title
the
chief
ordered
the
immediate
attendance
of
the
suffragan
and
two
fellows
of
the
college
of
physicians
at
this
terrifying
order
i
confess
that
i
fell
into
so
violent
a
trembling
for
indeed
my
last
hour
seemed
now
at
hand
that
i
could
no
longer
stand
upright
and
in
this
condition
of
mind
i
was
carried
being
unable
to
walk
and
more
dead
than
alive
out
of
the
house
of
life
to
the
headquarters
of
the
rebel
army
chapter
xvi
a
most
unexpected
conclusion
i
confess
i
say
that
i
was
borne
in
a
condition
from
the
house
of
life
farewell
suffragan
farewell
said
my
brethren
of
the
college
gathered
within
the
south
porch
where
a
guard
of
armed
rebels
waited
for
us
your
turn
ours
farewell
yet
if
any
concessions
can
be
made
yes
yes
if
any
concessions
could
be
made
only
to
save
life
they
might
be
certain
that
i
should
make
them
the
two
fellows
of
the
college
upon
whom
the
lot
they
drew
lots
had
fallen
accompanied
me
with
cheeks
as
pallid
and
hearts
as
full
of
terror
as
my
own
a
company
of
twenty
men
armed
escorted
us
i
looked
on
the
way
for
lines
of
people
to
witness
the
downfall
of
the
college
and
the
execution
of
its
heads
i
looked
for
the
scaffold
which
we
had
erected
and
for
the
executioner
whom
we
had
provided
i
listened
for
the
great
bell
which
we
had
caused
to
be
rung
strange
there
were
no
people
at
all
the
way
from
the
house
was
quite
clear
the
people
were
engaged
as
usual
at
their
work
i
saw
no
scaffold
and
no
executioner
i
heard
no
great
bell
yet
the
absence
of
these
things
did
not
reassure
me
in
the
least
but
everything
even
in
these
short
three
weeks
was
changed
nearly
the
whole
of
the
open
space
before
the
public
hall
was
now
covered
with
rows
of
tents
over
which
flew
bright
little
flags
they
were
quite
small
tents
meant
i
learned
afterwards
for
sleeping
besides
these
there
were
great
tents
open
at
the
sides
and
spread
within
with
tables
and
benches
at
which
sat
men
smoking
tobacco
and
drinking
beer
though
it
was
as
yet
only
the
forenoon
some
of
them
were
playing
cards
some
were
reading
books
and
some
a
great
many
were
eagerly
talking
they
were
all
dressed
in
tunics
of
scarlet
green
and
gray
and
wore
leathern
belts
with
helmets
the
costume
seemed
familiar
to
me
then
i
remembered
it
was
the
old
dress
of
a
soldier
wonderful
after
science
had
lavished
all
her
resources
in
order
to
suppress
and
destroy
among
the
people
the
old
passions
at
the
very
first
opportunity
the
rebels
had
succeeded
in
awakening
them
again
in
their
worst
and
most
odious
form
there
were
also
large
open
spaces
upon
which
regardless
of
the
some
of
the
men
were
marching
up
and
down
in
line
carrying
arms
and
performing
evolutions
to
the
command
of
an
officer
some
of
the
men
again
lay
sprawling
about
on
benches
merely
looking
on
and
doing
nothing
yet
with
a
lively
satisfaction
in
their
faces
they
ought
to
have
been
in
the
fields
or
the
workshops
and
everywhere
among
the
men
looking
on
at
the
drill
sitting
in
the
tents
walking
beside
them
sitting
with
them
on
the
benches
were
the
girls
dressed
and
adorned
after
the
bad
old
false
style
in
which
the
women
pretended
to
heighten
and
set
off
what
they
are
pleased
to
call
their
charms
by
garments
fantastically
cut
the
immodest
display
of
an
arm
or
a
neck
hair
curiously
dressed
and
adorned
colored
ribbons
flowers
stuck
in
their
hats
and
ornaments
tied
on
wherever
it
was
possible
and
such
joy
and
pride
in
these
silly
decorations
no
one
would
believe
how
these
girls
looked
at
each
other
and
themselves
but
to
think
that
the
poor
silly
men
should
have
fallen
into
the
nets
thus
clumsily
spread
for
them
and
this
after
all
our
demonstrations
to
show
that
woman
bears
in
every
limb
the
mark
of
inferiority
so
that
contempt
or
at
least
pity
and
not
admiration
at
all
to
say
nothing
of
the
extraordinary
foolish
passion
of
love
should
be
the
feeling
of
man
for
woman
however
at
this
moment
i
was
naturally
too
much
occupied
with
my
own
danger
to
think
of
these
things
one
thing
however
one
could
not
avoid
remarking
the
rebellion
must
have
spread
with
astonishing
rapidity
it
was
no
longer
a
company
of
fifteen
or
sixteen
men
it
was
a
great
army
that
we
saw
and
there
was
no
longer
any
doubt
possible
as
to
the
movement
the
past
was
restored
in
the
faces
of
the
young
men
and
the
girls
as
we
passed
through
them
i
remarked
sick
with
terror
as
i
was
the
old
old
expression
which
i
hoped
we
had
abolished
forever
the
eagerness
the
unsatisfied
desire
and
the
individualism
yes
the
individualism
i
saw
on
their
faces
plain
to
read
the
rights
of
property
why
as
i
walked
through
one
of
the
groups
composed
of
men
and
women
one
of
the
men
suddenly
rushed
forward
and
struck
another
in
the
face
with
his
fist
she
my
girl
he
cried
hoarsely
touch
her
if
you
dare
they
closed
round
the
pair
and
led
them
off
going
to
fight
it
out
said
one
of
our
guards
to
fight
it
out
what
a
fall
to
fight
it
out
to
call
a
woman
or
anything
else
your
own
after
all
our
teaching
and
to
fight
it
out
and
all
this
arrived
at
in
three
weeks
these
things
i
observed
i
say
as
one
observes
things
in
a
dream
and
remembers
afterwards
my
heart
failed
me
altogether
and
i
nearly
fainted
when
we
stopped
at
a
long
tent
before
which
floated
a
flag
on
a
flagstaff
they
carried
me
within
and
placed
me
in
a
chair
as
soon
as
my
eyes
recovered
the
power
of
sight
i
saw
sitting
at
the
head
of
the
table
linister
dressed
in
some
sort
of
scarlet
coat
with
a
sash
and
gold
lace
then
indeed
i
gave
myself
up
for
lost
it
was
the
court
and
we
were
called
before
it
to
receive
sentence
at
his
side
sat
half
a
dozen
officers
bravely
dressed
the
tent
was
filled
with
others
including
many
women
richly
dressed
i
observed
the
woman
mildred
clad
in
crimson
velvet
and
the
girl
christine
in
white
and
i
thought
they
regarded
me
with
vindictive
eyes
when
we
were
seated
linister
looked
up
his
face
was
always
grave
but
it
was
no
longer
melancholy
there
was
in
it
now
something
of
hope
or
triumph
or
resolution
i
know
not
what
brothers
he
said
gravely
once
my
brothers
of
the
college
i
have
called
you
before
us
in
order
to
make
a
communication
of
the
greatest
importance
and
one
which
will
doubtless
cause
you
considerable
surprise
what
is
the
matter
suffragan
hold
him
up
somebody
we
desire
that
you
should
hear
from
our
own
lips
what
we
propose
to
do
first
will
somebody
give
grout
a
glass
of
wine
or
brandy
or
something
pray
be
reassured
gentlemen
no
harm
i
promise
shall
happen
to
any
of
you
first
in
a
day
or
two
the
doors
of
the
house
will
be
thrown
open
and
you
shall
be
free
again
to
renew
your
old
life
if
you
still
feel
disposed
to
do
so
i
repeat
that
no
violence
is
intended
towards
you
grout
pull
yourself
together
man
sit
up
and
leave
off
shaking
you
will
be
able
without
opposition
i
say
to
carry
on
again
your
administration
of
the
people
on
the
old
lines
i
trust
however
that
you
will
consider
the
situation
and
the
condition
to
which
you
have
reduced
unfortunate
humanity
very
seriously
in
short
though
we
are
absolute
masters
of
the
situation
and
now
command
a
force
against
which
it
would
be
absurd
for
you
to
contend
we
are
going
to
abandon
the
field
and
leave
everything
to
you
were
we
dreaming
the
present
is
so
odious
to
our
people
the
surroundings
of
this
place
are
so
full
of
the
horrible
and
loathsome
present
that
we
have
resolved
to
leave
it
altogether
we
find
in
fact
that
it
will
be
impossible
to
begin
the
new
life
until
all
traces
of
your
administration
are
removed
or
lost
and
we
shall
be
so
much
clogged
by
your
public
halls
your
houses
your
system
and
the
miserable
lives
to
which
you
have
reduced
most
of
the
men
and
women
that
we
must
either
send
them
and
you
away
or
go
away
ourselves
on
the
whole
it
will
give
us
less
trouble
to
go
away
ourselves
therefore
as
soon
as
our
preparations
are
ready
we
shall
go
we
shall
carry
with
us
from
the
common
stores
all
that
we
shall
be
likely
to
want
in
starting
our
new
community
we
shall
leave
you
to
work
out
undisturbed
the
triumph
of
science
as
you
understand
it
upon
these
poor
wretches
already
more
than
half
stupefied
by
your
treatment
we
shall
take
with
us
all
those
whom
by
any
means
by
the
beauty
of
women
the
splendor
of
arms
the
ancient
dresses
the
ancient
music
the
ancient
dances
we
have
been
able
to
awaken
from
their
torpor
they
amount
in
all
to
no
more
than
a
thousand
or
so
of
young
men
and
as
many
maidens
as
for
the
rest
they
are
sunk
in
a
lethargy
so
deep
that
we
have
been
unable
to
rouse
them
they
are
already
very
near
to
the
condition
which
you
desire
yet
i
know
not
these
poor
dull
brains
may
be
swiftly
and
suddenly
fired
with
some
contagion
which
may
at
any
time
ruin
your
calculations
and
destroy
the
boasted
triumph
do
not
rely
too
much
upon
the
torpor
of
this
apparently
helpless
herd
you
had
at
the
beginning
a
grand
weapon
with
which
to
enslave
them
you
could
keep
them
alive
and
you
could
save
them
from
disease
if
only
they
were
obedient
if
they
once
get
beyond
the
recollection
or
the
fear
of
either
what
will
you
do
we
go
he
paused
and
looked
round
the
room
filled
with
the
eager
faces
which
brought
the
past
back
to
me
futile
eagerness
ever
pressing
on
gaining
nothing
sinking
into
the
grave
before
there
was
time
to
gain
anything
that
had
come
back
that
we
go
he
repeated
his
face
had
long
been
so
melancholy
that
one
hardly
knew
him
for
the
same
man
so
triumphant
was
it
now
we
go
to
repair
the
mistakes
of
many
many
years
we
go
to
lead
mankind
back
into
the
ancient
paths
it
was
not
altogether
you
my
friends
who
destroyed
humanity
it
was
mainly
the
unfortunate
discovery
of
the
german
professor
we
were
working
admirably
in
the
right
direction
we
were
making
life
longer
which
was
then
far
too
short
we
were
gradually
preventing
diseases
which
had
been
beyond
the
control
of
our
wisest
men
we
were
by
slow
degrees
in
the
only
true
way
through
the
revelation
of
nature
feeling
our
way
to
health
and
prolongation
of
life
yet
whatever
happened
whatever
we
might
discover
the
first
law
of
life
which
we
did
not
understand
was
that
to
all
things
earthly
there
must
come
an
end
then
happened
the
event
by
which
that
end
was
indefinitely
postponed
again
i
say
i
blame
not
you
so
much
as
the
current
of
events
which
bore
you
along
it
seemed
logical
that
everybody
able
or
imbecile
weak
or
strong
healthy
or
sickly
skilled
or
incompetent
should
alike
reap
the
fruits
of
the
great
discovery
if
he
did
so
he
was
also
entitled
to
his
equal
share
in
the
world
goods
this
was
the
right
of
man
put
forward
as
if
there
could
be
no
question
at
all
about
it
every
child
was
to
inherit
an
equal
share
of
everything
it
was
a
false
and
a
mischievous
claim
what
every
child
inherited
was
the
right
of
fighting
for
his
share
without
danger
of
injustice
or
oppression
and
the
next
step
after
the
slaughter
of
the
old
was
the
forbidding
of
more
births
what
that
has
done
for
the
world
look
round
and
see
for
yourselves
in
the
torpor
of
the
women
and
the
apathy
of
the
men
the
people
by
this
time
had
learned
the
great
lesson
that
you
wished
to
teach
them
that
death
and
disease
were
the
only
two
evils
then
the
college
of
physicians
took
the
place
of
the
former
priesthood
with
its
own
mysteries
to
guard
and
its
gifts
to
distribute
i
do
not
deny
that
you
we
have
done
the
work
well
the
prevention
of
the
old
diseases
is
nearly
perfect
yet
at
any
moment
a
new
class
of
disease
may
spring
up
and
baffle
all
your
science
he
had
often
talked
in
this
way
before
but
never
with
so
much
authority
yet
he
was
going
to
abandon
the
whole
all
that
he
and
his
friends
had
gained
were
we
dreaming
his
talk
about
my
administration
affected
me
not
one
whit
i
knew
all
his
arguments
but
the
thought
that
he
was
going
away
that
he
would
actually
leave
us
in
power
and
possession
filled
me
with
amazement
the
others
looked
and
listened
as
if
he
were
speaking
for
them
the
right
of
man
to
an
equal
share
in
everything
has
been
carried
out
look
around
you
and
ask
yourselves
if
the
result
is
satisfactory
i
have
often
asked
you
that
question
you
have
replied
that
the
present
is
only
a
stage
in
the
triumph
of
science
what
is
the
next
stage
to
that
question
also
you
have
a
reply
well
we
give
it
back
to
you
the
whole
of
your
present
your
people
so
stupid
so
docile
so
sluggish
your
house
your
college
your
secrecy
your
mystery
your
authority
take
them
you
shall
have
them
again
to
do
with
them
as
seems
fit
to
you
at
these
words
my
heart
welled
over
with
joy
would
he
really
but
on
what
conditions
would
he
really
give
us
back
the
whole
there
were
no
conditions
he
meant
exactly
what
he
said
he
would
give
everything
back
to
us
were
we
dreaming
were
we
dreaming
as
for
me
and
my
friends
he
said
we
shall
sally
forth
to
found
a
new
settlement
and
to
govern
it
by
the
ideas
of
the
past
no
one
in
our
settlement
will
be
obliged
to
work
but
if
he
does
not
he
shall
certainly
starve
nobody
will
inherit
any
share
to
anything
except
what
he
may
win
by
struggle
there
will
be
no
equality
at
all
but
every
man
shall
have
what
he
can
honestly
get
for
himself
no
women
shall
be
compelled
to
work
but
they
may
work
if
they
please
and
at
such
things
as
they
please
many
old
and
things
have
been
already
revived
such
as
love
we
are
in
love
again
we
who
actually
forgot
what
love
was
like
for
all
the
years
which
we
have
ceased
to
number
or
to
chronicle
it
is
impossible
to
describe
to
you
my
former
brother
suffragan
who
never
even
in
the
old
days
felt
the
passion
the
intense
joy
the
ecstasy
of
love
the
other
men
murmured
approval
but
love
is
a
plant
which
while
it
is
hardy
to
endure
many
things
withers
and
dies
under
certain
conditions
it
was
found
to
flourish
in
the
old
time
through
all
the
changes
of
life
it
survived
the
time
of
youth
and
beauty
it
lasted
through
middle
age
flourished
through
the
scenes
of
old
age
it
lasted
beyond
the
grave
it
endured
changes
of
fortune
decay
of
health
poverty
sickness
and
even
helplessness
but
one
thing
kills
love
it
can
not
endure
the
dull
monotony
which
has
followed
the
great
discovery
it
can
not
live
long
while
the
face
and
form
know
no
change
while
the
voice
never
changes
while
the
dress
the
hours
of
work
the
work
itself
the
food
know
no
change
these
are
things
which
kill
the
flower
of
love
now
all
things
desirable
this
is
a
saying
too
hard
for
you
suffragan
depend
upon
love
with
love
they
have
revived
the
courtesy
of
man
to
woman
the
deference
of
the
stronger
to
the
weaker
the
stimulus
of
work
hope
and
ambition
unselfishness
devotion
the
sweet
illusions
of
imagination
all
these
things
have
been
born
again
within
the
last
three
weeks
they
have
been
born
again
and
with
them
the
necessity
of
an
end
all
things
earthly
most
have
an
end
the
chief
looked
round
him
the
men
murmured
approval
and
tears
stood
in
the
eyes
of
the
women
we
can
not
let
them
die
and
since
the
first
law
of
love
is
change
and
the
certain
end
we
have
resolved
suffragan
on
forgetting
the
grand
discovery
could
this
be
our
late
arch
physician
were
we
dreaming
we
shall
forego
any
share
in
it
only
the
chiefs
here
gathered
together
know
as
yet
what
has
been
resolved
little
by
little
the
truth
will
get
possession
of
our
people
that
an
end
is
ordained
we
made
no
reply
to
this
extraordinary
announcement
what
could
we
say
we
only
gasped
with
wonder
you
can
not
understand
this
grout
i
do
not
expect
that
you
should
for
long
years
past
i
have
understood
that
the
great
discovery
was
the
greatest
misfortune
that
ever
happened
to
mankind
for
all
things
must
have
an
end
else
all
that
is
worth
preserving
will
wither
and
die
i
have
nearly
done
you
can
go
back
to
your
house
and
you
can
carry
on
your
administration
as
you
please
but
there
is
a
warning
which
we
have
first
to
pronounce
before
we
let
you
go
your
ultimate
triumph
of
science
is
too
great
a
degradation
of
humanity
to
be
endured
in
years
to
come
when
our
successors
rule
in
our
place
they
shall
send
an
army
here
to
inquire
into
the
conduct
of
your
trust
if
we
find
the
people
more
brutish
deeper
sunk
in
apathy
and
torpor
that
army
will
seize
the
house
of
life
and
the
college
of
physicians
and
will
destroy
your
laboratories
and
will
suffer
all
men
and
women
of
the
people
and
fellows
of
the
sacred
college
alike
to
die
never
forget
this
warning
you
shall
surely
die
one
more
point
and
i
have
done
i
mention
it
with
diffidence
grout
because
i
can
not
hope
for
your
sympathy
your
own
convictions
on
the
subject
were
arrived
at
you
have
often
told
us
when
you
were
a
boy
and
were
based
upon
the
arguments
of
a
spouter
in
the
whitechapel
road
i
believe
that
john
lax
deceased
was
the
learned
authority
who
convinced
you
therefore
you
will
not
understand
me
grout
when
i
tell
you
that
we
have
found
the
soul
again
the
soul
all
earthly
things
must
have
an
end
but
there
are
things
beyond
that
end
most
astonishing
things
are
likely
to
follow
from
this
discovery
long
thoughts
and
great
hopes
have
already
begun
to
spring
up
in
our
minds
our
people
are
reading
again
the
old
literature
is
full
of
the
soul
they
are
reading
the
great
poets
of
old
and
are
beginning
to
understand
what
they
mean
i
can
not
make
this
intelligible
to
you
grout
you
will
not
understand
all
that
this
discovery
brings
with
it
you
will
never
never
understand
that
it
is
a
discovery
ten
times
a
million
times
greater
and
better
for
mankind
than
the
great
discovery
itself
of
which
you
and
i
alone
held
the
secret
i
take
that
secret
with
me
because
i
can
not
forget
it
but
i
repeat
we
shall
never
use
it
soon
very
soon
the
new
active
life
will
make
men
once
more
familiar
with
the
old
figure
who
carried
a
scythe
there
will
be
accidents
new
diseases
will
arise
age
will
creep
slowly
on
the
great
discovery
will
be
quietly
forgotten
in
minds
which
you
had
made
so
dull
that
they
could
not
understand
when
we
rescued
them
what
it
meant
but
we
the
leaders
shall
know
well
that
their
happiness
must
have
an
end
all
earthly
things
he
repeated
for
the
fifth
time
must
have
an
end
that
is
all
grout
but
when
you
hear
from
me
again
unless
the
administration
is
changed
indeed
the
people
the
college
and
you
my
suffragan
shall
all
die
together
you
shall
die
grout
you
and
your
friends
shall
die
and
so
farewell
guard
take
them
back
to
the
house
we
returned
to
the
house
relieved
of
our
terror
but
much
amazed
i
had
heard
in
the
old
days
how
men
would
be
so
blockishly
possessed
by
the
thought
of
a
woman
a
creature
inferior
to
man
that
they
would
throw
away
everything
in
the
world
for
her
sake
and
now
linister
himself
with
all
those
who
followed
after
him
had
given
up
everything
because
if
life
goes
what
is
there
left
and
for
the
sake
of
a
woman
what
could
it
mean
how
to
explain
this
madness
on
any
scientific
theory
we
told
our
colleagues
and
they
marvelled
and
some
suspected
a
trick
but
linister
was
not
a
man
to
play
tricks
as
for
the
soul
and
all
that
rubbish
if
linister
was
so
mad
as
to
give
up
everything
for
a
woman
he
might
just
as
well
adopt
all
the
old
creeds
together
that
was
no
concern
of
ours
and
as
for
this
precious
discovery
about
things
earthly
coming
to
an
end
what
had
that
to
do
with
the
calm
and
tranquil
state
of
pure
existence
which
we
were
providing
for
mankind
why
should
that
ever
have
an
end
that
threatened
army
has
never
come
for
some
time
the
thought
of
it
gave
us
considerable
uneasiness
but
it
has
never
come
and
i
believe
for
my
own
part
that
now
it
never
will
come
as
for
the
people
there
has
been
no
such
outbreak
of
memory
as
was
prophesied
on
the
contrary
they
have
approached
more
and
more
in
docility
meekness
mindlessness
and
absence
of
purpose
to
the
magnificent
ideal
which
i
cherish
for
them
i
know
not
when
it
will
arrive
but
the
time
is
as
certain
to
come
as
the
morrow
sun
is
to
dawn
when
the
last
stage
of
humanity
will
be
reached
an
inert
mass
of
breathing
feeding
sleeping
flesh
kept
by
the
holy
college
the
triumph
of
science
free
from
decay
and
death
they
went
away
in
the
afternoon
three
or
four
days
later
they
took
with
them
everything
from
the
public
stores
which
they
thought
would
be
useful
provisions
of
all
kinds
wine
beer
and
cider
in
casks
stuff
for
clothing
furniture
everything
that
they
could
think
of
they
took
the
pictures
out
of
the
gallery
the
books
from
the
library
and
nearly
everything
that
was
in
the
museum
from
the
laboratory
in
the
house
they
took
a
great
number
of
volumes
and
a
quantity
of
instruments
at
the
last
moment
nearly
all
the
assistants
and
the
workmen
agreed
to
join
them
so
that
we
were
left
with
numbers
greatly
reduced
it
is
impossible
to
enumerate
the
vast
quantities
of
things
which
they
took
with
them
the
wagons
in
which
they
were
packed
covered
a
couple
of
miles
of
road
the
drivers
were
taken
from
the
people
and
ordered
to
discharge
their
duty
and
as
they
never
came
back
these
poor
wretches
probably
perished
with
the
rebels
they
went
forth
in
perfect
order
first
an
advance
guard
of
mounted
men
then
a
portion
of
the
main
body
among
whom
rode
the
chief
with
his
staff
after
them
came
the
women
some
riding
on
horseback
among
whom
were
the
woman
mildred
and
the
girl
christine
showing
in
their
faces
that
foolish
and
excited
happiness
which
is
so
different
from
the
sweet
tranquillity
which
we
have
introduced
indeed
all
the
women
were
beyond
themselves
with
this
silly
happiness
they
sang
they
laughed
they
talked
some
sat
in
carriages
of
all
kinds
some
in
wagons
some
walked
and
what
with
their
chatter
and
their
dresses
one
would
have
thought
them
a
company
of
monkeys
dressed
up
after
the
women
came
the
wagons
and
lastly
the
rest
of
the
men
i
forgot
to
say
that
they
had
bands
of
music
with
them
drums
fifes
cornets
and
all
kinds
of
musical
instruments
and
that
they
carried
flags
and
that
the
men
sang
as
they
marched
whither
they
went
or
what
became
of
them
whether
they
carried
out
the
desperate
resolve
of
giving
up
the
great
discovery
i
know
not
they
marched
away
and
we
returned
to
our
former
life
one
thing
more
i
must
relate
we
that
is
the
college
were
seated
reassured
as
to
our
safety
watching
this
great
departure
five
minutes
or
so
after
the
women
had
passed
i
observed
two
of
my
own
friends
learned
fellows
of
the
college
who
had
always
followed
my
lead
and
voted
with
me
eagerly
whispering
each
other
and
plucking
one
another
by
the
sleeve
then
they
suddenly
rose
and
pulled
off
their
black
gowns
and
fled
swiftly
in
the
direction
of
the
wagons
and
carriages
where
the
women
sat
we
have
never
seen
or
heard
from
any
of
these
unfortunate
men
