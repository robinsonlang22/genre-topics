human

more

the
real
hard
sell

stuart
ben
tilman
sat
down
in
the
easiest
of
all
easy
chairs
he
picked
up
a
magazine
flipped
pages
stood
up
snapped
fingers
walked
to
the
view
wall
walked
back
sat
down
picked
up
the
magazine
he
was
waiting
near
the
end
of
the
day
after
hours
in
the
lush
plush
waiting
room
the
customer
ease
is
the
sales
manager
please
to
see
the
old
man
he
was
fidgety
but
not
about
something
about
nothing
he
was
irritated
at
nobody
at
the
world
at
himself
he
was
irritated
at
himself
because
there
was
no
clear
reason
for
him
to
be
irritated
at
anything
there
he
sat
ben
tilman
normally
a
cheerful
pleasant
young
man
he
was
a
salesman
like
any
modern
man
and
a
far
better
salesman
than
most
he
had
a
sweet
little
wife
blonde
and
pretty
he
had
a
fine
husky
boy
smart
a
real
future
national
sales
manager
he
loved
them
both
he
had
every
reason
to
be
contented
with
his
highly
desirable
comfortable
lot
and
yet
he
had
been
getting
more
sour
and
edgy
ever
since
about
six
months
after
the
baby
came
home
from
the
center
and
the
novelty
of
responsibility
for
wife
and
child
had
worn
off
he
had
now
quit
three
jobs
good
enough
sales
jobs
where
he
was
doing
well
in
a
year
for
no
reason
for
petty
pointless
reasons
with
ancestral
insurance
generations
of
protection
he
made
the
billion
dollar
club
and
immediately
begun
to
feel
dissatisfied
with
it
just
before
cute
sexy
blonde
betty
had
suddenly
come
from
nowhere
into
his
life
and
he
had
married
her
that
had
helped
sure
but
as
soon
after
that
as
he
had
started
paying
serious
attention
to
his
job
again
he
was
fed
up
with
it
too
much
paper
work
all
those
forms
it
work
for
a
robot
not
a
man
he
told
betty
when
he
quit
a
lie
the
paper
work
was
as
he
looked
back
on
it
not
bad
at
all
pleasant
even
in
a
way
it
was
just
nothing
anything
climatizers
sniffles
he
said
kept
killing
his
sales
presentation
even
though
his
record
was
good
enough
toothbrushes
then
were
a
fine
product
only
the
vibration
with
his
gold
inlay
seemed
to
give
him
headaches
after
every
demonstration
he
did
a
gold
inlay
but
the
headaches
were
real
enough
so
he
quit
so
now
he
had
a
great
new
job
with
a
great
organization
amalgamated
production
for
living
alprodliv
he
was
about
to
take
on
his
first
big
assignment
for
that
he
had
felt
a
spark
of
the
old
enthusiasm
and
it
had
carried
him
into
working
out
a
bright
new
sales
approach
for
the
deal
tonight
the
old
man
himself
had
taken
a
personal
interest
which
was
a
terrific
break
and
still
ben
tilman
felt
that
uneasy
dissatisfaction
damn
robb
will
see
you
now
tilman
said
the
cool
robot
voice
from
the
desk
it
was
after
customer
hours
and
the
charming
human
receptionist
had
gone
the
robot
secretary
like
most
working
robots
was
functional
in
form
circuits
and
wires
mike
speaker
extension
arms
to
type
and
to
reach
any
file
in
the
room
wheels
for
mobility
thanks
hon
said
ben
nevertheless
robot
secretaries
were
all
programmed
and
rated
female
and
it
was
wise
to
be
polite
to
them
after
all
they
could
think
and
had
feelings
there
were
a
lot
of
important
things
they
could
do
for
a
salesman
or
sometimes
not
do
this
one
being
helpful
stretched
out
a
long
metal
arm
to
open
the
door
to
the
inner
office
for
ben
he
smiled
his
appreciation
and
went
in
the
old
man
amalgamated
grand
old
salesman
was
billiard
bald
aging
a
little
stout
and
a
little
slower
now
but
he
was
still
a
fine
sales
manager
he
sat
at
his
huge
old
fashioned
oak
desk
as
ben
walked
across
the
office
evening
sir
no
response
louder
good
evening
robb
robb
it
ben
sir
ben
tilman
you
memo
me
to
come
still
no
sign
the
eyes
under
the
great
beetling
brows
seemed
closed
ben
grinned
and
reached
out
across
the
wide
desk
toward
the
small
plastic
box
hanging
on
the
old
man
chest
the
old
man
glanced
up
as
ben
tapped
the
plastic
lightly
with
his
fingernail
oh
ben
it
you
the
old
man
raised
his
hand
to
adjust
the
ancient
style
hearing
aid
he
affected
as
ben
sank
into
a
chair
sorry
ben
i
just
had
old
brannic
in
here
a
fine
old
robot
yes
but
like
most
of
that
model
so
he
gestured
at
the
hearing
aid
ben
smiled
everyone
knew
the
old
man
used
that
crude
old
rig
so
he
could
pointedly
tune
out
conversations
he
did
care
to
hear
any
time
you
were
talking
to
him
and
that
distant
look
came
into
his
half
closed
eyes
you
could
be
sure
that
you
were
cut
off
sorry
ben
well
now
i
simply
wanted
to
check
with
you
boy
everything
all
set
for
tonight
well
yes
sir
everything
is
set
and
programmed
betty
and
i
will
play
it
all
evening
for
the
suspense
let
them
wonder
build
it
up
and
then
instead
of
the
big
pitch
they
be
looking
for
we
let
it
go
easy
a
new
twist
on
the
old
ben
boy
it
going
to
go
i
feel
it
it
in
the
air
things
are
just
ripe
for
a
new
pitch
selling
you
got
to
do
by
feel
eh
ben
by
sales
genius
and
the
old
seat
of
the
pants
good
after
tonight
i
going
all
out
a
thirty
day
campaign
i
put
the
top
sales
artist
of
every
regional
office
on
it
they
can
train
on
your
test
pattern
tapes
i
believe
we
can
turn
over
billions
before
everybody
picks
up
the
signal
and
it
senilesces
you
give
an
old
man
a
new
faith
in
sales
ben
a
well
sir
but
the
old
man
knack
with
the
approach
was
contagious
for
the
moment
ben
caught
it
and
he
felt
pretty
good
about
the
coming
night
work
he
and
betty
together
would
put
the
deal
over
that
would
be
something
sure
it
would
how
do
you
and
your
wife
like
the
place
ben
it
was
some
place
for
sure
the
brand
new
house
that
amalgamated
had
installed
ben
betty
and
bennie
in
the
day
after
he
had
signed
up
it
uh
just
fine
sir
betty
likes
it
very
much
really
we
both
do
he
hoped
his
tone
was
right
good
ben
well
be
sure
to
stop
by
in
the
morning
i
have
the
tapes
of
course
but
i
want
your
analysis
might
be
a
little
vacation
bonus
in
it
for
you
too
sir
i
do
know
how
to
thank
you
the
old
man
waved
a
hand
nothing
you
wo
have
earned
my
boy
robots
ca
sell
that
was
the
set
dismissal
yes
sir
robots
ca
manage
sales
or
he
winked
the
old
man
chuckled
an
old
joke
was
never
too
old
for
the
old
man
the
same
old
bromides
every
time
and
the
same
hearty
chuckle
ben
left
on
the
end
of
it
dialing
home
on
his
new
convertible
he
felt
not
too
bad
some
of
the
old
lift
in
spirits
came
as
the
circuits
digested
the
directions
selected
a
route
and
zipped
up
into
a
traffic
pattern
the
old
man
was
a
wonderful
sales
manager
and
boss
the
new
pitch
that
he
and
betty
would
try
tonight
was
smart
he
could
feel
he
had
done
something
exercising
his
sales
ability
with
fair
success
he
fed
himself
this
pitch
all
along
the
two
hundred
mile
hop
home
from
the
city
the
time
and
distance
did
bother
him
gives
me
time
to
think
he
had
told
betty
whether
or
not
this
seemed
to
her
an
advantage
she
did
say
at
least
she
liked
the
place
amalgamated
country
gentleman
estate
spacious
yet
fully
automated
we
are
the
old
man
told
ben
when
he
was
given
the
quarters
starting
a
new
trend
with
the
terrific
decline
in
birth
rate
during
the
past
to
years
you
be
astonished
at
how
much
room
there
is
out
there
no
reason
for
everyone
to
live
in
the
suburban
centers
any
more
with
millions
of
empty
apartments
in
them
high
time
we
built
something
else
eh
trouble
with
people
today
no
initiative
in
obsolescing
but
we
move
them
home
ben
left
the
kart
out
and
conveyed
up
the
walk
the
front
door
opened
betty
had
been
watching
for
him
he
walked
to
the
family
vueroom
as
usual
declining
to
convey
in
the
house
the
hell
with
the
conveyor
feelings
if
so
simple
a
robot
really
had
any
he
to
walk
color
pattern
betty
ordered
the
vuescreen
as
he
came
in
robot
audio
out
with
people
talking
in
the
house
it
was
still
necessary
to
put
the
machines
under
master
automatic
and
manual
control
some
of
the
less
sophisticated
robots
might
pick
up
some
chance
phrase
of
conversation
and
interpret
it
as
an
order
if
left
on
audio
ben
said
betty
getting
up
to
meet
him
you
late
ben
was
too
good
a
salesman
to
argue
that
instead
he
took
her
in
his
arms
and
kissed
her
it
was
a
very
good
sixty
seconds
later
that
she
pushed
him
away
with
a
severeness
destroyed
by
a
blush
and
a
giggle
to
say
late
but
making
up
for
lost
time
huh
and
sober
too
you
must
be
feeling
good
for
a
change
sure
and
you
feel
even
better
sugar
he
reached
for
her
again
she
slipped
away
from
him
laughing
but
his
wrist
caught
on
the
locket
she
always
wore
her
only
memento
from
her
parents
dead
in
the
old
crash
disaster
she
stood
still
slightly
annoyed
as
he
unhooked
and
his
mood
was
not
broken
but
set
back
a
little
got
into
you
tonight
anyway
ben
oh
i
do
know
did
i
tell
you

of
those
nights

she
blushed
smiled

pitch

and
we

three
couples
due
here

than
a
half
hour
besides
i

to
you
about
nana
that
damned
new
model
now
what
she
very
upset
about
bennie
i

blame
her
this
afternoon
he
simply
refused
his
indoctrination
all
the
time
he
should
have
been
playing
store
with
playmate
he
insisted
on
things
himself
mind
you
not
playmate
on
the
walls
with
an
old
pencil
of
yours
he
found
someplace
in
your
things
nana
could
do
a
thing
with
him
she
says
you
got
to
give
him
a
spanking
why
me
why

you
now
ben
we

over
that
and
over
it
discipline

the
job

bennie
just
a
baby
let

do
a
few
things

ben
that
nana

an
officious
busybody
trying
to
run
our
lives
oh
ben
you
know
nana
loves
little
bennie
she
only
wants
to
help
him
but
to
what
she
never
dream
of
lifting
a
finger
against
bennie
no
matter
what
he
did
and
she
lives
in
terror
that
he
cut
her
switch
in
some
temper
tantrum
hmph
well
i
going
up
right
now
and
tell
her
if
i
hear
another
word
from
her
about
spanking
bennie
i
cut
her
switch
myself
then
she
can
go
back
to
central
for
reprogramming
and
see
how
she
likes
it
ben
you
would
why
not
maybe
she
needs
a
new
personality
you
wo
say
a
thing
to
her
you
too
this
time
i
wo
be
this
time
he
was
he
met
nana
in
the
hallway
outside
room
like
all
nurse
teaching
and
children
personal
service
robots
she
was
human
in
form
except
for
her
control
dial
safely
out
of
reach
top
center
the
human
form
was
reassuring
to
children
kept
them
from
feeling
strange
with
parents
back
nana
was
big
stout
buxom
motherly
to
reassure
parents
now
tilman
she
said
with
weary
impatience
you
are
too
late
surely
you
do
intend
to
burst
in
and
disturb
your
son
now
surely
i
do
but
he
is
having
his
supper
you
will
upset
him
ca
you
understand
that
you
should
arrange
to
be
here
between
and
if
you
wish
to
interview
the
child
did
he
miss
me
sorry
i
could
make
it
earlier
but
now
i
am
going
to
see
him
a
minute
mr
tilman
nana
and
what
this
about
your
wanting
bennie
spanked
because
he
drew
a
few
pictures
surely
you
realize
these
are
the
child
formative
years
tilman
he
should
be
learning
to
think
in
terms
of
selling
now
not
things
that
robot
work
tilman
robots
ca
sell
you
know
and
what
will
people
let
alone
robots
think
if
you
let
your
boy
grow
up
he
growing
up
fine
and
i
am
going
in
to
see
him
mr
tilman
for
two
credits
nana
i
cut
your
switch
you
hear
me
tilman
no
no
please
i
sorry
let
the
boy
scrawl
a
bit
perhaps
it
wo
hurt
him
go
in
and
see
him
if
you
must
but
do
try
not
to
upset
him
or
all
right
all
right
but
please
tilman
my
switch
very
well
nana
i
leave
it
this
time
thank
you
mr
tilman
so
we
understand
each
other
nana
though
matter
of
fact
i
hanged
if
i
ever
did
quite
see
why
you
robots
get
so
worked
up
about
your
identities
would
you
mr
tilman
of
course
but
well
yes
i
suppose
i
do
see
in
a
way
let
go
see
so
ben
tilman
went
into
the
nursery
and
enjoyed
every
second
of
a
fast
roughhouse
with
his
laughing
chubby
son
and
heir
no
doubt
it
was
very
bad
just
after
supper
but
nana
with
a
rather
humanly
anxious
restraint
confined
herself
to
an
unobtrusive
look
of
disapproval
he
left
bennie
giggling
and
doubtless
upset
at
least
to
a
point
of
uneagerness
for
nana
bedtime
story
about
billie
the
oldtime
newsboy
who
sold
the
brooklyn
bridge
so
then
he
was
run
through
a
fast
shower
shave
and
change
by
valet
he
floated
downstairs
just
as
betty
came
out
of
the
cocktail
lounge
to
say
code
on
the
approach
indicator
must
be
the
stoddards
they
always
get
every
place
first
in
time
for
an
extra
drink
fred
and
alice
yes
but
damn
their
taste
for
gin
do
let
barboy
keep
the
cork
in
the
vermouth
all
evening
i
like
a
touch
of
vermouth
i
wonder
if
maybe
i
should
no
you
should
mix
the
cocktails
yourself
and
scandalize
everybody
you
know
perfectly
well
barboy
really
does
do
better
anyway
well
maybe
everything
all
set
hon
sorry
i
was
late
no
trouble
here
i
just
fed
robutler
the
base
program
this
morning
and
spent
the
rest
of
the
day
planning
my
side
of
our
sell
how
to
tantalize
the
girls
pique
the
curiosity
without
giving
it
away
but
you
know
she
laughed
a
little
ruefully
i
sort
of
miss
not
having
even
the
shopping
to
do
sometimes
it
hardly
seems
as
though
you
need
a
wife
at
all
ben
slid
an
arm
around
her
waist
selling
is
the
only
thing
robots
ca
do
sugar
he
pulled
her
close
ben
they
at
the
door
they
were
and
then
in
the
door
and
over
this
and
that
and
complimenting
barboy
on
the
martinis
then
the
wilsons
came
and
the
bartletts
and
that
was
it
three
couples
will
be
right
ben
had
analyzed
it
enough
so
we
can
let
them
get
together
and
build
up
each
others
curiosity
but
not
too
many
for
easy
control
people
that
do
know
us
so
well
they
might
be
likely
to
guess
the
gimmick
we
let
them
stew
all
evening
while
they
enjoy
the
country
gentleman
hospitality
then
very
casually
we
toss
it
out
and
let
it
lie
there
in
front
of
them
they
will
be
sniffing
ready
to
nibble
the
clincher
will
drive
them
right
in
i
stake
my
sales
reputation
on
it
if
it
matters
a
damn
he
added
but
silently
they
entertained
three
couples
at
their
party
it
was
a
delightful
party
a
credit
to
ben
betty
and
the
finest
house
robots
the
mind
of
amalgamated
could
devise
by
ten
they
had
dropped
a
dozen
or
more
random
hints
but
never
a
sales
pitch
suspense
was
building
nicely
when
betty
put
down
an
empty
glass
and
unobtrusively
pushed
the
button
to
cue
nana
perfect
timing
they
apologized
to
the
guests
we
ashamed
to
be
so
but
we
feel
better
if
we
look
in
on
the
boy
when
he
wakes
in
the
night
it
keeps
him
from
forgetting
us
then
they
floated
off
upstairs
together
ostensibly
to
see
nana
and
little
bennie
fred
stoddard
some
place
they
have
here
eh
a
little
too
advanced
for
my
taste
this
single
dwelling
idea
but
maybe
ben
sure
must
have
landed
something
juicy
with
amalgamated
to
afford
this
what
the
devil
is
he
pushing
anyway
scoville
wilson
shrug
beats
me
you
know
before
dinner
i
cornered
him
at
the
bar
to
see
if
i
could
slip
in
a
word
or
two
of
sell
damned
if
he
did
sign
an
order
for
my
junior
tape
library
without
even
a
c
level
resistance
then
he
talked
a
bit
about
the
drinks
and
i
thought
sure
he
was
pushing
that
new
model
barboy
i
was
all
set
to
come
back
with
a
sincere
it
over
and
then
he
took
a
bottle
from
the
barboy
added
a
dash
of
vermouth
to
his
drink
and
walked
off
without
a
word
of
sell
he
always
was
an
odd
one
lucy
wilson
turns
from
woman
talk
with
the
other
two
wives
oh
no
i
knew
it
was
the
barboy
set
they
would
have
him
set
so
slow
besides
did
you
hear
the
way
she
carried
on
about
the
nursery
and
that
lovely
nana

have
been
a
but
ben
goofed
his
cue
to

in
on

me

a
close
does
amalgamated
handle
those
nurseries
tom
bartlett
amalgamated

be
something
big

to
hit

he
belle
bartlett

half
hour

passing
around
with
nightcaps

a
reducegar
to

sophisticated
lips
quickly
ben
tilman

on
his
feet

pulled
a
small
metal
cylinder
from

a
flourish

open
palm

and
reached
out
to

the
reducegar

perfectly
charming
and
that
it
said
ben
smiling
a
sheaf
of
paper
forms
suddenly
in
his
hand
what
not
the
house
yes
amalgamated
country
gentleman
estate
complete
everything
in
it
except
bennie
betty
and
me
your
equity
in
your
center
can
serve
as
down
payment
easy
terms
issue
insurance
actually
i
can
show
you
how
counting
in
your
entertainment
vacation
incidental
and
living
expenses
the
country
gentleman
will
honestly
cost
you
less
ben
how
simply
too
clever
ben
let
it
rest
there
it
was
enough
fred
stoddard
after
a
short
scuffle
with
scoville
wilson
for
the
pen
signed
the
contract
with
a
flourish
sco
followed
there
there
now
ben
said
betty
holding
bennie
a
little
awkwardly
in
her
arms
in
the
they
had
moved
out
so
the
stoddards
could
move
right
in
now
they
were
on
their
way
in
to
their
reserved
suite
at
amalgamated
you
were
absolutely
marvellous
imagine
selling
all
three
of
them
there
was
anything
to
it
actually
ben
how
can
you
say
that
nobody
else
could
have
done
it
it
was
a
sales
masterpiece
and
just
think
now
salesmen
all
over
the
hemisphere
are
going
to
follow
your
sales
plan
does
it
make
you
proud
happy
ben
you
are
going
to
be
like
again
no
of
course
he
was
he
was
pleased
and
proud
anyway
the
old
man
would
be
and
that
certainly
was
something
a
man
had
to
feel
good
about
winning
the
approval
of
amalgamated
grand
old
man
and
it
did
seem
to
make
betty
happy
but
the
actual
selling
of
the
fool
house
and
even
the
two
other
identical
houses
on
the
other
side
of
the
hill
he
just
could
seem
to
get
much
of
a
glow
over
it
he
had
done
it
and
what
had
he
done
it
was
the
insurance
and
the
toothbrushes
all
over
again
and
the
old
nervous
sour
feeling
inside
at
least
we
do
have
a
vacation
trip
coming
out
of
it
hon
the
practically
promised
it
yesterday
if
our
sell
sold
we
could
go
back
to
that
queer
new
it
yourself
camp
up
on
the
lake
you
insisted
on
dragging
me
to
the
last
week
of
our
vacation
last
summer
ben
really
he
going
to
be
like
that
she
knew
it
well
even
you
admitted
it
was
some
fun
oh
sort
of
i
suppose
for
a
little
while
once
you
got
used
to
the
whole
place
without
one
single
machine
that
could
think
or
do
even
the
simplest
little
thing
by
itself
so
well
almost
like
being
savages
do
you
think
it
would
be
safe
for
bennie
we
ca
watch
him
all
the
time
you
know
people
used
to
manage
in
the
old
days
and
remember
those
people
the
burleys
who
were
staying
up
there
that
queer
crazy
bunch
who
went
there
for
a
vacation
when
the
camp
was
first
opened
and
then
just
stayed
honestly
ben
surely
you
not
thinking
of
oh
nothing
like
that
just
a
vacation
only
only
those
queer
peculiar
people
the
burleys
had
seemed
so
relaxed
and
cheerful
grandma
and
ma
burley
cleaning
washing
cooking
on
the
ancient
electric
stove
little
donnie
being
a
nuisance
poking
at
the
keys
on
his
father
crude
manual
typewriter
a
museum
piece
donnie
and
his
brothers
wasting
away
childhood
digging
and
piling
sand
on
the
beach
paddling
a
boat
and
actually
building
a
play
house
it
was
mad
people
playing
robots
and
yet
they
seemed
to
have
a
wonderful
time
while
they
were
doing
it
but
how
do
you
keep
staying
here
he
had
asked
buck
burley
why
they
put
you
out
who
asked
buck
how
nobody
can
sell
me
on
leaving
we
like
it
here
no
robot
can
force
us
out
here
we
are
here
we
stay
they
pulled
into
the
ramp
bennie
was
fussy
the
nursery
nana
was
strange
to
him
on
impulse
betty
took
him
in
to
sleep
in
their
room
ignoring
the
disapproving
stares
of
both
the
nana
and
the
roboy
with
their
things
they
were
tired
let
down
they
went
to
bed
quietly
in
the
morning
betty
was
already
up
when
ben
stumbled
out
of
bed
hi
she
said
nervously
cheerful
the
house
nanas
all
had
overload
this
morning
and
i
wo
stand
for
any
of
those
utility
components
with
bennie
so
i
taking
care
of
him
myself
bennie
chortled
and
drooled
at
his
unreprimanded
ben
mustered
a
faint
smile
and
turned
to
go
dial
a
shave
cool
shower
and
dress
at
robather
that
done
he
had
a
bite
of
breakfast
he
felt
less
than
but
better
last
night
gone
well
the
old
man
would
give
them
a
vacation
clearance
to
any
resort
in
the
world
or
out
why
gloom
he
rubbed
bennie
unruly
hair
kissed
betty
and
conveyed
over
from
to
office
in
tone
a
told
him
the
old
man
was
waiting
for
him
susan
the
human
receptionist
in
the
outer
office
favored
him
with
a
dazzling
smile
there
was
a
girl
who
could
sell
and
had
a
product
of
her
own
too
the
old
man
was
at
his
big
oak
desk
but
a
signal
honor
he
got
up
and
came
half
across
the
room
to
grab
ben

and
shake
it

the
full
report
son
checked
the
tapes

spanking

the
matter
of

old

a
hot
selling
streak

to
see
you
get
off
the
track

that
healthy
tired
feeling
now
we
have
the
product
we
have
senior
with
more
circuits
than
ever
before
all
possible
information
every
conceivable
plot
maybe
a
saturation
guilt
type
campaign
to
start
but
it
up
to
you
ben
i
do
care
how
you
do
it
but
move
books
books
eh
well
now
ben
was
interested
funny
thing
sir
but
that
ties
in
with
something
i
was
thinking
about
just
last
night
you
have
an
angle
good
boy
yes
sir
well
it
is
a
wild
thought
maybe
but
last
summer
when
i
was
on
vacation
i
met
a
man
up
at
that
new
camp
and
well
i
know
it
sounds
silly
but
he
was
writing
a
book
nonsense
just
what
i
thought
sir
but
i
read
some
of
it
and
i
do
know
it
had
a
sort
of
a
feel
about
it
something
new
sir
it
might
catch
on
all
right
all
right
that
enough
you
a
salesman
you
sold
me
on
the
book
ben
was
surprised
quit
pulling
an
old
man
leg
ben
i
sold
on
your
needing
a
vacation
i
fill
out
your
vacation
pass
right
now
the
old
man
still
a
vigorous
vital
figure
turned
and
walked
back
to
his
yes
sir
said
the
secretarial
voice
got
it
vacation
clearance
for
tilman
ben
any
resort
and
family
said
ben
and
family
very
good
sir
the
old
man
made
his
sign
on
the
pass
and
said
heavily
all
right
then
ben
that
it
maybe
if
you
go
back
up
to
that
place
for
a
few
days
and
see
that
psycho
who
was
writing
a
book
again
perhaps
you
realize
how
impractical
it
is
but
sir
i
serious
about
that
book
it
really
did
have
he
broke
off
the
old
man
was
sitting
there
face
blank
withdrawn
ben
could
feel
he
was
even
listening
that
damned
hearing
aid
of
his
the
old
man
had
cut
it
off
suddenly
unreasoningly
ben
was
furious
he
stood
by
the
huge
desk
and
he
reached
across
toward
the
hearing
aid
on
the
old
chest
to
turn
up
the
volume
the
old
man
looked
up
and
saw
ben
hand
stretching
out
a
sudden
look
of
fear
came
into
his
china
blue
clear
eyes
but
he
made
no
move
he
sat
frozen
in
his
chair
ben
hesitated
a
second
what
but
he
did
have
to
ask
he
knew
and
he
also
knew
what
he
was
going
to
do
no
said
the
old
man
no
ben
i
only
been
trying
to
help
trying
to
serve
your
best
interests
the
best
way
i
know
ben
you
must
but
ben
moved
forward
he
took
the
plastic
box
on
the
old
man
chest
and
firmly
cut
the
switch
the
old
man
the
robot
old
man
went
lifeless
and
slumped
back
in
his
chair
as
ben
stretched
to
cut
off
the
then
he
picked
up
his
vacation
clearance
robots
ca
sell
eh
he
said
to
the
dead
machine
behind
the
desk
well
you
could
sell
me
that
time
could
you
old
man
clumsily
rustily
ben
whistled
a
cheerful
little
tune
to
himself
hell
they
could
do
anything
at
all
except
sell
you
ca
fool
some
of
the
people
all
of
the
time
he
remarked
over
his
shoulder
to
the
still
silent
figure
of
the
old
man
as
he
left
the
office
it
was
a
man
said
that
he
closed
the
door
softly
behind
him
betty
would
be
waiting
betty
was
waiting
her
head
ached
as
she
bounced
bennie
the
child
of
ben
of
herself
and
of
an
unknown
egg
cell
from
an
anonymous
ovary
on
her
knees
betty
secret
model
the
highest
development
of
the
art
of
robotics
had
known
instantly
when
ben
cut
the
old
man
switch
she
had
half
expected
it
but
it
made
her
headache
worse
but
damn
my
programming
she
spoke
abruptly
aloud
nervously
fingering
the
locket
around
her
neck
damn
it
and
shift
circuit
right
he
is
my
husband
and
he
is
right
and
i
glad
i
glad
going
to
the
camp
and
i
going
to
help
him
stay
after
all
why
should
a
man
want
to
do
things
just
as
much
as
a
robot
he
had
energy
circuits
feelings
too
she
knew
he
did
for
herself
she
loved
her
ben
and
bennie
but
still
just
that
enough
occupation
she
was
glad
they
were
going
to
the
new
isolation
compound
for
but
unstable
socially
dangerous
individual
humans
at
the
camp
there
would
be
things
to
do
at
the
camp
they
would
be
happy
all
at
once
the
headache
that
had
been
bothering
her
so
these
past
months
was
gone
she
felt
fine
and
she
smiled
at
little
bennie
she
said
kissing
his
smooth
untroubled
baby
forehead
daddy
coming
bennie
laughed
and
started
to
reach
for
the
locket
around
mommy
neck
but
just
then
the
door
opened
and
he
jumped
down
to
run
and
meet
his
daddy
end
