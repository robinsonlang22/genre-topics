service
with
a
smile
was
truly
a
gentleman
robot
the
ladies
slightest
wish
was
his
command
by
charles
fontenay
herbert
bowed
with
a
muted
clank
indicating
he
probably
needed
oiling
somewhere
and
presented
alice
with
a
perfect
martini
on
a
silver
tray
he
stood
holding
the
tray
a
white
permanent
porcelain
smile
on
his
smooth
metal
face
as
alice
sipped
the
drink
and
grimaced
it
a
good
martini
herbert
said
alice
thank
you
but
dammit
i
wish
you
did
have
that
everlasting
smile
i
am
very
sorry
miss
alice
but
i
am
unable
to
alter
myself
in
any
way
replied
herbert
in
his
polite
hollow
voice
he
retired
to
a
corner
and
stood
impassively
still
holding
the
tray
herbert
had
found
a
silver
deposit
and
made
the
tray
herbert
had
found
sand
and
made
the
cocktail
glass
herbert
had
combined
god
knew
what
atmospheric
and
earth
chemicals
to
make
what
tasted
like
gin
and
vermouth
and
herbert
had
frozen
the
ice
to
chill
it
sometimes
said
thera
wistfully
it
occurs
to
me
it
would
be
better
to
live
in
a
mud
hut
with
a
real
man
than
in
a
mansion
with
herbert
the
four
women
lolled
comfortably
in
the
living
room
of
their
spacious
house
as
luxurious
as
anything
any
of
them
would
have
known
on
distant
earth
the
rugs
were
thick
the
furniture
was
overstuffed
the
paintings
on
the
walls
were
aesthetic
and
inspiring
the
shelves
were
filled
with
booktapes
and
musictapes
herbert
had
done
it
all
except
the
booktapes
and
musictapes
which
had
been
salvaged
from
the
wrecked
spaceship
do
you
suppose
we
ever
escape
from
this
best
of
all
possible
manless
worlds
asked
betsy
fluffing
her
thick
black
hair
with
her
fingers
and
inspecting
herself
in
a
mirror
i
do
see
how
answered
blond
alice
glumly
that
atmospheric
trap
would
wreck
any
other
ship
just
as
it
wrecked
ours
and
the
same
magnetic
layer
prevents
any
radio
message
from
getting
out
no
afraid
we
a
colony
a
colony
perpetuates
itself
reminded
marguerite
acidly
we
are
a
colony
without
men
they
were
not
the
prettiest
four
women
in
the
universe
nor
the
youngest
the
prettiest
women
and
the
youngest
did
not
go
to
space
but
they
were
young
enough
and
healthy
enough
or
they
could
not
have
gone
to
space
it
had
been
a
year
and
a
half
now
an
earth
year
and
a
half
on
a
nice
little
planet
revolving
around
a
nice
little
yellow
sun
herbert
the
robot
was
obedient
and
versatile
and
had
provided
them
with
a
house
food
clothing
anything
they
wished
created
out
of
the
raw
elements
of
earth
and
air
and
water
but
the
bones
of
all
the
men
who
had
been
aspace
with
these
four
ladies
lay
mouldering
in
the
wreckage
of
their
spaceship
and
herbert
could
not
create
a
man
herbert
did
not
have
to
have
direct
orders
and
he
had
tried
once
to
create
a
man
when
he
had
overheard
them
wishing
for
one
they
had
buried
the
corpse
perfect
in
every
detail
except
that
it
never
had
been
alive
it
been
a
hot
day
said
alice
fanning
her
brow
i
wish
it
would
rain
silently
herbert
moved
from
his
corner
and
went
out
the
door
marguerite
gestured
after
him
with
a
bitter
little
laugh
it
rain
this
afternoon
she
said
i
do
know
how
herbert
does
it
maybe
with
silver
iodide
but
it
rain
would
it
have
been
simpler
to
get
him
to
the
house
alice
that
a
good
idea
said
alice
thoughtfully
we
should
have
had
him
do
it
before
herbert
had
not
quite
completed
the
task
of
the
house
when
the
other
spaceship
crashed
they
all
rushed
out
to
the
smoking
site
the
four
women
and
herbert
it
was
a
tiny
scoutship
and
its
single
occupant
was
alive
he
was
unconscious
but
he
was
alive
and
he
was
a
man
they
carted
him
back
to
the
house
tenderly
and
put
him
to
bed
they
hovered
over
him
like
four
hens
over
a
single
chick
waiting
and
watching
for
him
to
come
out
of
his
coma
while
herbert
scurried
about
creating
and
administering
the
necessary
medicines
he
live
said
thera
happily
thera
had
been
a
space
nurse
be
on
his
feet
and
walking
around
in
a
few
weeks
a
man
murmured
betsy
with
something
like
awe
in
her
voice
i
could
almost
believe
herbert
brought
him
here
in
answer
to
our
prayers
now
girls
said
alice
we
have
to
realize
that
a
man
brings
problems
as
well
as
possibilities
there
was
a
hardness
to
her
tone
which
almost
masked
the
quiver
behind
it
there
was
a
defiant
note
of
competition
there
which
had
not
been
heard
on
this
little
planet
before
what
do
you
mean
asked
thera
i
know
what
she
means
said
marguerite
and
the
new
hardness
came
natural
to
her
she
means
which
one
of
us
gets
him
betsy
the
youngest
gasped
and
her
mouth
rounded
to
a
startled
thera
blinked
as
though
she
were
coming
out
of
a
daze
that
right
said
alice
do
we
draw
straws
or
do
we
let
him
choose
could
we
wait
suggested
betsy
timidly
could
we
wait
until
he
gets
well
herbert
came
in
with
a
new
thermometer
and
poked
it
into
the
unconscious
man
mouth
he
stood
by
the
bed
waiting
patiently
no
i
do
think
we
can
said
alice
i
think
we
ought
to
have
it
all
worked
out
and
agreed
on
so
there
wo
be
any
dispute
about
it
i
say
draw
straws
said
marguerite
marguerite
face
was
thin
and
she
had
a
skinny
figure
betsy
the
youngest
opened
her
mouth
but
thera
forestalled
her
we
are
not
on
earth
she
said
firmly
in
her
soft
mellow
voice
we
do
have
to
follow
terrestrial
customs
and
we
should
there
only
one
solution
that
will
keep
everybody
happy
all
of
us
and
the
man
and
that
is
asked
marguerite
drily
polygamy
of
course
he
must
belong
to
us
all
betsy
shuddered
but
surprisingly
she
nodded
that
well
and
good
agreed
marguerite
but
we
have
to
agree
that
no
one
of
us
will
be
favored
above
the
others
he
has
to
understand
that
from
the
start
that
fair
said
alice
pursing
her
lips
yes
that
fair
but
i
agree
with
marguerite
he
must
be
divided
equally
among
the
four
of
us
chattering
over
the
details
the
hard
competitiveness
vanished
from
their
tones
the
four
left
the
sickroom
to
prepare
supper
after
supper
they
went
back
in
herbert
stood
by
the
bed
the
eternal
smile
of
service
on
his
metal
face
as
always
herbert
had
not
required
a
direct
command
to
accede
to
their
wishes
the
man
was
divided
into
four
quarters
one
for
each
of
them
it
was
a
very
neat
surgical
job
