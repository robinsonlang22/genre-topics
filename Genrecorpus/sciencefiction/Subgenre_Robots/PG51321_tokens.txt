extensive
research
did
not
uncover
any
evidence
that
the
copyright
on
this
publication
was
renewed
being
two
men
rolled
out
of
one
would
solve
my
problems
but
which
one
would
i
be
i
suppose
that
every
guy
reaches
a
point
once
in
his
lifetime
when
he
gets
one
hundred
and
forty
per
cent
fed
up
with
his
wife
understand
now
i
got
nothing
against
marriage
or
any
thing
like
that
marriage
is
great
it
a
good
old
american
institution
except
that
it
got
one
defect
in
it
big
enough
to
throw
a
cat
through
especially
when
you
happen
to
be
married
to
a
woman
like
marge
it
so
oh
i
have
divorced
marge
in
a
minute
if
we
been
living
in
the
blissful
but
with
the
family
solidarity
amendment
of
and
all
the
divorce
taxes
we
have
these
days
since
the
women
got
their
teeth
into
politics
to
say
nothing
of
the
aggrieved
spouse
compensation
act
i
have
been
a
pauper
for
the
rest
of
my
life
if
i
tried
it
that
aside
from
the
social
repercussions
involved
you
ca
really
blame
me
for
looking
for
another
way
out
but
a
man
has
to
be
desperate
to
try
to
buy
himself
an
ego
prime
so
all
right
i
was
desperate
i
spent
eight
years
trying
to
keep
marge
happy
which
was
exactly
seven
and
a
half
years
too
long
marge
was
a
dream
to
look
at
with
her
tawny
hair
and
her
sulky
eyes
and
a
shape
that
could
set
your
teeth
chattering
but
that
was
where
the
dream
stopped
she
had
a
tongue
like
a
wood
rasp
and
a
list
of
grievances
long
enough
to
paper
the
bedroom
wall
when
she
was
complaining
she
was
crying
and
when
she
was
crying
she
was
pointing
out
in
chilling
detail
exactly
where
george
faircloth
fell
short
as
a
model
husband
which
happened
to
be
everywhere
half
of
the
time
she
had
a
beastly
headache
for
which
i
was
personally
responsible
and
the
other
half
she
was
sore
about
something
so
per
cent
of
the
time
we
got
along
like
a
couple
of
tomcats
in
a
packing
case
maybe
we
just
were
meant
for
each
other
i
do
know
i
used
to
envy
guys
like
harry
folsom
at
the
office
his
wife
is
no
joy
to
live
with
either
but
at
least
he
could
take
a
spin
down
to
rio
once
in
a
while
with
one
of
the
stenographers
and
get
away
with
it
i
knew
better
than
to
try
marge
was
already
so
jealous
that
i
even
smile
at
the
company
receptionist
without
a
twinge
of
guilt
give
marge
something
real
to
howl
about
and
i
be
ready
for
the
rehab
center
in
a
week
but
i
underestimated
marge
she
did
need
anything
real
as
i
found
out
when
jeree
came
along
business
was
booming
and
the
secretaries
at
the
office
got
shuffled
around
from
time
to
time
since
i
had
an
job
i
got
an
secretary
her
name
was
jeree
and
she
was
gorgeous
as
a
matter
of
fact
she
was
better
than
gorgeous
she
was
the
sort
of
secretary
every
businessman
ought
to
have
in
his
office
not
to
do
any
work
just
to
sit
there
jeree
was
tall
and
dark
and
she
could
convey
more
without
saying
anything
than
i
ever
dreamed
was
possible
the
first
day
she
was
there
she
conveyed
to
me
very
clearly
that
if
i
cared
to
supply
the
opportunity
she
be
glad
to
supply
the
motive
that
night
i
could
tell
that
marge
had
been
thinking
something
over
during
the
day
she
let
me
get
the
first
bite
of
dinner
halfway
to
my
mouth
and
then
she
said
i
hear
you
got
a
new
secretary
today
i
muttered
something
into
my
coffee
cup
and
pretended
not
to
hear
marge
turned
on
her
accusing
look
i
also
hear
that
and
tapes
out
at
and
thinks
you
handsome
marge
had
quite
a
spy
system
she
could
be
much
of
a
secretary
she
added
she
a
perfectly
good
secretary
i
blurted
and
kicked
myself
mentally
i
should
have
known
marge
traps
by
then
marge
exploded
i
did
get
any
supper
and
she
was
still
going
strong
at
midnight
i
tried
to
argue
but
when
marge
got
going
there
was
no
stopping
her
i
had
my
ultimatum
as
far
as
jeree
was
concerned
harry
folsom
administered
the
de
at
coffee
next
morning
what
you
need
is
an
ego
prime
he
said
with
a
grin
solve
all
your
problems
i
hear
they
work
like
a
charm
i
set
my
coffee
cup
down
bells
were
ringing
in
my
ears
do
be
ridiculous
it
against
the
law
anyway
i
would
think
of
such
a
thing
it
it
indecent
harry
shrugged
just
joking
old
man
just
joking
still
it
fun
to
think
about
eh
freedom
from
wife
absolutely
safe
and
harmless
not
even
too
expensive
if
you
got
the
right
contacts
and
i
got
a
friend
who
knows
a
guy
just
then
jeree
walked
past
us
and
flashed
me
a
big
smile
i
gripped
my
cup
for
dear
life
and
still
spilled
coffee
on
my
tie
as
i
said
a
guy
gets
fed
up
and
maybe
opportunity
would
only
knock
once
and
an
ego
prime
would
solve
all
my
problems
as
harry
had
told
me
it
was
completely
illegal
of
course
the
wonder
was
that
ego
prime
ever
got
to
put
their
product
on
the
market
at
all
once
the
nation
housewives
got
wind
of
just
what
their
product
was
from
the
first
there
was
rigid
federal
control
and
laws
regulating
the
use
of
primes
right
down
to
the
local
level
you
could
get
a
license
for
a
utility
model
prime
if
you
were
a
big
business
executive
or
a
high
public
official
or
a
movie
star
or
something
like
that
but
even
then
his
circuits
had
to
be
inspected
every
two
months
and
he
had
to
have
a
thousand
paralyzers
and
you
had
to
specify
in
advance
exactly
what
you
wanted
your
prime
to
be
able
to
do
when
where
how
why
and
under
what
circumstances
the
law
did
leave
a
man
much
leeway
but
everybody
knew
that
if
you
wanted
a
personal
prime
with
all
his
circuits
open
and
no
questions
asked
you
could
get
one
black
market
prices
were
steep
and
you
ran
your
own
risk
but
it
could
be
done
harry
folsom
told
his
friend
who
knew
a
guy
and
a
few
greenbacks
got
lost
somewhere
and
i
found
myself
looking
at
a
greasy
little
man
with
a
black
mustache
and
a
bald
spot
up
in
a
dingy
warehouse
off
lower
broadway
ah
yes
the
little
man
said
faircloth
we
been
expecting
you
i
did
like
the
looks
of
the
guy
any
more
than
the
looks
of
the
place
i
been
told
you
can
supply
me
with
a
he
coughed
yes
yes
i
understand
it
might
be
possible
he
fingered
his
mustache
and
regarded
me
from
pouchy
eyes
busy
executives
often
come
to
us
to
avoid
the
ah
unpleasantness
of
formal
arrangements
naturally
we
only
act
as
agents
you
might
say
we
never
see
the
merchandise
ourselves
he
wiped
his
hands
on
his
trousers
now
were
you
interested
in
the
ordinary
utility
model
mr
faircloth
i
assumed
he
was
just
being
polite
you
did
come
to
the
back
door
for
utility
models
or
perhaps
you
require
one
of
our
deluxe
models
very
careful
workmanship
only
a
few
key
paralyzers
in
operation
and
practically
complete
circuit
duplication
very
useful
for
ah
close
contact
work
you
know
social
engagements
conferences
i
was
shaking
my
head
i
want
a
deluxe
model
i
told
him
he
grinned
and
winked
ah
indeed
you
want
perfect
duplication
yes
indeed
domestic
situations
can
be
awkward
shall
we
say
very
awkward
i
gave
him
a
cold
stare
i
could
see
where
my
domestic
problems
were
any
affairs
of
his
he
got
the
idea
and
hurried
me
back
to
a
storeroom
we
keep
a
few
blanks
here
for
the
basic
measurement
you
go
to
our
laboratory
on
street
to
have
the
minute
impressions
taken
but
i
can
assure
you
you
be
delighted
simply
delighted
the
blanks
were
very
impressive
clay
and
putty
and
steel
faceless
brainless
he
went
over
me
like
a
tailor
checking
measurements
of
all
sorts
he
was
thorough
embarrassingly
thorough
in
fact
but
finally
he
was
finished
i
went
on
to
the
laboratory
and
that
was
all
there
was
to
it
practical
androids
had
been
a
pipe
dream
until
hunyadi
invented
the
hunyadi
had
no
idea
in
the
world
what
to
do
with
it
once
he
invented
it
but
a
couple
of
enterprising
engineers
bought
him
body
and
soul
the
problems
of
anatomy
design
artistry
audio
and
visio
circuitry
and
so
forth
and
ended
up
with
the
modern
ego
primes
we
have
today
i
spent
a
busy
two
hours
under
the
np
microprobes
the
artists
worked
outside
while
the
np
technicians
worked
inside
i
came
out
of
it
pretty
woozy
but
a
shot
of
set
that
straight
then
i
waited
in
the
recovery
room
for
another
two
hours
dreaming
up
ways
to
use
my
prime
when
i
got
him
finally
the
door
opened
and
the
head
technician
walked
in
followed
by
a
tall
man
with
worried
blue
eyes
and
a
tired
look
on
his
face
meet
george
faircloth
prime
the
technician
said
grinning
at
me
like
a
nursing
mother
i
shook
hands
with
myself
good
firm
handshake
i
thought
admiringly
nothing
flabby
about
it
i
slapped
george
prime
on
the
shoulder
happily
come
on
brother
i
said
you
got
a
job
to
do
but
secretly
i
was
wondering
what
jeree
was
doing
that
night
george
prime
had
remote
controls
as
well
as
a
completely
recorded
neurological
analogue
of
his
boss
who
was
me
george
prime
thought
what
i
thought
about
the
same
things
i
did
in
the
same
way
i
did
the
only
difference
was
that
what
i
told
george
prime
to
do
george
prime
did
if
i
told
him
to
go
to
a
business
conference
in
san
francisco
and
make
the
smallest
possible
concessions
for
the
largest
possible
orders
he
would
go
there
and
do
precisely
that
his
signature
would
be
my
signature
it
would
hold
up
in
court
and
if
i
told
him
that
my
wife
marge
was
really
a
sweet
girl
and
that
he
was
to
stay
home
and
keep
her
quiet
and
happy
any
time
i
chose
he
do
that
too
george
prime
was
a
duplicate
of
me
right
down
to
the
sandy
hairs
on
the
back
of
my
hands
our
fingerprints
were
the
same
we
had
the
same
mannerisms
and
used
the
same
figures
of
speech
the
only
physical
difference
apparent
even
to
an
expert
was
the
tiny
buried
in
the
hair
above
his
ear
a
little
pressure
there
would
stop
george
prime
dead
in
his
tracks
he
was
so
lifelike
even
i
kept
forgetting
that
he
was
basically
just
a
pile
of
gears
i
planned
very
carefully
how
i
meant
to
use
him
of
course
every
man
who
been
married
eight
years
has
a
sanctuary
he
builds
it
up
and
maintains
it
against
assault
in
the
very
teeth
of
his
natural
instinct
to
clean
poke
pry
and
rearrange
things
sometimes
it
takes
him
years
of
diligent
work
to
establish
his
hideout
and
be
confident
that
it
will
stay
inviolate
but
if
he
starts
early
enough
and
sticks
with
it
long
enough
and
is
fierce
enough
and
persistent
enough
and
crafty
enough
he
probably
win
in
the
end
the
girls
hate
him
for
it
but
he
win
with
some
men
it
just
a
box
on
their
dressers
or
a
desk
or
a
corner
of
an
unused
back
room
but
i
had
set
my
sights
high
early
in
the
game
with
me
it
was
the
whole
workshop
in
the
garage
at
first
marge
tried
open
warfare
she
had
to
clean
the
place
up
she
said
i
told
her
i
did
her
to
clean
it
up
she
could
clean
the
whole
house
as
often
as
she
chose
but
would
clean
up
the
workshop
after
a
couple
of
sharp
engagements
on
that
field
marge
staged
a
strategic
withdrawal
and
reorganized
her
attack
a
little
pile
of
wood
shavings
would
be
on
the
workshop
floor
one
night
and
be
gone
the
next
a
wrench
would
be
back
on
the
rack
upside
down
of
course
an
open
paint
can
would
have
a
cover
on
it
i
always
knew
i
screamed
loudly
and
bitterly
i
ranted
and
raved
i
swore
i
rig
up
a
with
a
shotgun
so
she
quit
trying
to
clean
in
there
and
just
went
in
once
in
a
while
to
take
a
look
around
i
fixed
that
with
the
old
routine
every
time
she
so
much
as
set
foot
in
that
workshop
she
had
a
battle
on
her
hands
for
the
next
week
or
so
she
could
count
on
it
it
was
that
predictable
she
never
found
out
how
i
knew
and
after
seven
years
or
so
it
wore
her
down
she
did
go
into
the
workshop
any
more
as
i
said
you
got
to
be
persistent
but
you
win
eventually
if
you
persistent
now
all
my
effort
paid
off
i
got
marge
out
of
the
house
for
an
hour
or
two
that
day
and
had
george
prime
delivered
and
stored
in
the
big
closet
in
the
workshop
they
hooked
his
controls
up
and
left
me
a
manual
of
instructions
for
running
him
when
i
got
home
that
night
there
he
was
just
waiting
to
be
put
to
work
after
supper
i
went
out
to
the
workshop
to
get
the
pipe
i
left
there
i
said
i
pushed
george
prime
button
winked
at
him
and
switched
on
the
circuits
go
to
it
brother
i
said
george
prime
put
my
pipe
in
his
mouth
lit
it
and
walked
back
into
the
house
five
minutes
later
i
heard
them
fighting
it
sounded
so
familiar
that
i
laughed
out
loud
then
i
caught
a
cab
on
the
corner
and
headed
uptown
we
had
quite
a
night
jeree
and
i
got
home
just
about
time
to
start
for
work
and
sure
enough
there
was
george
prime
starting
my
car
business
suit
on
briefcase
under
his
arm
i
pushed
the
recall
and
george
prime
got
out
of
the
car
and
walked
into
the
workshop
he
stepped
into
his
cradle
in
the
closet
i
turned
him
off
and
then
drove
away
in
the
car
bless
his
metallic
soul
he
even
kissed
marge
for
me
needless
to
say
the
affairs
of
george
faircloth
took
on
a
new
sparkle
with
george
prime
on
hand
to
cover
the
home
front
for
the
first
week
i
was
hardly
home
at
all
i
must
say
i
felt
a
little
guilty
leaving
poor
old
george
prime
to
cope
with
marge
all
the
time
he
looked
and
acted
so
human
it
was
easy
to
forget
that
he
literally
could
care
less
but
i
felt
apologetic
all
the
same
whenever
i
took
him
out
of
his
closet
she
really
a
sweet
girl
underneath
it
all
i
say
you
learn
to
like
her
after
a
bit
of
course
i
like
her
george
prime
said
you
told
me
to
did
you
stop
worrying
she
really
a
sweet
girl
underneath
it
all
he
sounded
convincing
enough
but
still
it
bothered
me
you
sure
you
understand
the
exchange
mechanism
i
asked
i
did
want
any
there
as
you
can
imagine
perfectly
said
george
prime
when
you
buzz
the
recall
i
wait
for
the
first
logical
opportunity
i
can
find
to
come
out
to
the
workshop
and
you
take
over
but
you
might
get
nervous
you
might
inadvertently
tip
her
off
george
prime
looked
pained
really
old
man
i
a
super
deluxe
model
remember
i
do
have
fourteen
activated
hunyadi
tubes
up
in
this
cranial
vault
of
mine
just
for
nothing
you
the
one
that
nervous
i
take
care
of
everything
relax
so
i
did
jeree
made
good
all
her
tacit
promises
and
then
some
she
had
a
very
cozy
little
apartment
on
street
where
we
went
to
relax
after
a
hard
day
at
the
office
when
we
were
doing
the
town
that
is
as
long
as
jeree
did
try
too
much
conversation
everything
was
wonderful
and
then
when
jeree
got
a
little
boring
there
was
sybil
in
the
accounting
department
or
dorothy
in
promotion
or
jane
or
ingrid
i
could
go
on
at
some
length
but
i
wo
i
was
building
quite
a
reputation
for
myself
around
the
office
of
course
it
was
like
buying
your
first
set
in
a
week
or
so
the
novelty
wears
off
a
little
and
you
start
eating
on
schedule
again
it
took
a
little
while
but
i
finally
had
things
down
to
a
reasonable
program
tuesday
and
thursday
nights
i
was
informally
out
while
formally
in
sometimes
i
took
sunday
nights
out
if
things
got
too
sticky
around
the
house
over
the
weekend
the
rest
of
the
time
george
prime
cooled
his
heels
in
his
closet
locked
up
of
course
ca
completely
trust
a
wife
to
observe
a
taboo
no
matter
how
well
trained
she
is
there
was
an
irreconcilable
amount
of
risk
george
prime
had
to
some
questions
about
my
work
at
the
office
there
was
no
way
to
supply
him
with
current
data
until
the
time
for
his
regular
refill
and
at
the
laboratory
in
the
meantime
george
prime
had
to
make
do
with
what
he
had
but
as
he
himself
pointed
out
he
was
a
super
deluxe
model
marge
did
suspect
a
thing
in
fact
george
prime
seemed
to
be
having
a
remarkable
effect
on
her
i
did
notice
anything
at
first
i
was
hardly
ever
home
but
one
night
i
found
my
pipe
and
slippers
laid
out
for
me
and
the
evening
paper
neatly
folded
on
my
chair
and
it
brought
me
up
short
marge
had
been
extremely
docile
lately
we
had
had
a
good
fight
in
days
weeks
come
to
think
of
it
i
thought
it
over
and
shrugged
old
age
i
figured
she
was
bound
to
mellow
sometime
but
pretty
soon
i
began
to
wonder
if
she
was
mellowing
a
little
too
much
one
night
when
i
got
home
she
kissed
me
almost
as
though
she
really
meant
it
there
was
an
unpleasant
word
all
through
dinner
which
happened
to
be
steak
with
mushrooms
served
in
the
dining
room
by
candlelight
with
dinner
music
that
marge
could
never
bear
chiefly
because
i
liked
it
we
sat
over
coffee
and
cigarettes
and
it
seemed
almost
like
old
times
old
times
in
fact
i
even
caught
myself
looking
at
marge
again
really
at
her
watching
the
light
catch
in
her
hair
almost
admiring
the
sparkle
in
her
brown
eyes
sparkle
i
said
not
glint
as
i
mentioned
before
marge
was
always
easy
to
look
at
that
night
she
was
practically
ravishing
what
are
you
doing
to
her
i
asked
george
prime
later
out
in
the
workshop
why
nothing
said
george
prime
looking
innocent
he
could
fool
me
with
his
look
though
because
it
was
exactly
the
look
i
use
when
i
guilty
and
pretending
to
be
innocent
there
must
be
george
prime
shrugged
any
woman
will
warm
up
if
you
spend
enough
time
telling
her
all
the
things
she
wants
to
hear
and
pay
all
the
attention
to
her
that
she
wants
paid
to
her
that
elemental
psychology
i
can
give
you
page
references
i
ought
to
mention
that
george
prime
had
a
complete
set
of
basic
texts
run
into
his
circuits
at
a
slightly
additional
charge
never
can
tell
when
an
odd
bit
of
information
will
come
in
useful
well
you
must
be
doing
quite
a
job
i
said
never
managed
to
warm
marge
up
much
i
try
said
george
prime
oh
i
not
complaining
i
hastened
to
add
forgetting
that
a
feelings
ca
be
hurt
and
that
he
was
only
acting
like
me
because
it
was
in
character
i
was
just
curious
of
course
george
i
really
delighted
that
you
doing
so
well
thank
you
george
but
the
next
night
when
i
was
with
dawn
who
happens
to
be
a
gorgeous
redhead
who
could
put
marge
to
shame
on
practically
any
field
of
battle
except
maybe
brains
i
kept
thinking
about
marge
all
evening
long
and
wondering
if
things
were
getting
just
a
little
out
of
hand
the
next
evening
i
almost
tripped
over
george
prime
coming
out
of
a
liquor
store
i
ducked
quickly
into
an
alley
and
flagged
him
are
you
doing
out
on
the
street
he
gave
me
my
martyred
look
just
buying
some
bourbon
you
were
out
but
you
not
supposed
to
be
off
the
premises
marge
asked
me
to
come
i
could
tell
her
i
was
sorry
but
her
husband
would
let
me
could
i
well
certainly
not
you
want
me
to
keep
her
happy
do
you
you
do
want
her
to
get
suspicious
no
but
suppose
somebody
saw
us
together
if
she
ever
got
a
hint
i
sorry
george
prime
said
contritely
it
seemed
the
right
thing
to
do
would
have
done
it
at
least
that
what
my
judgment
center
maintained
we
had
quite
an
argument
well
tell
your
judgment
center
to
use
a
little
sense
i
snapped
i
do
want
it
to
happen
again
the
next
night
i
stayed
home
even
though
it
was
tuesday
night
i
was
beginning
to
get
worried
of
course
i
did
have
complete
control
i
could
snap
george
prime
off
any
time
i
wanted
or
even
take
him
in
for
a
complete
recircuiting
but
it
seemed
a
pity
he
was
doing
such
a
nice
job
marge
was
docile
as
a
kitten
even
more
so
than
before
she
sympathized
with
my
hard
day
at
the
office
and
agreed
heartily
that
the
boss
despite
all
appearances
was
in
reality
a
jabbering
idiot
after
dinner
i
suggested
a
movie
but
marge
gave
me
an
odd
sort
of
look
and
said
she
thought
it
would
be
much
nicer
to
spend
the
evening
at
home
by
the
fire
i
just
gotten
settled
with
the
paper
when
she
came
into
the
living
room
and
sat
down
beside
me
she
was
wearing
some
sort
of
filmy
affair
i
never
laid
eyes
on
before
and
i
caught
a
whiff
of
my
favorite
perfume
georgie
she
said
uh
do
you
still
love
me
i
set
the
paper
down
and
stared
at
her
how
that
of
course
i
still
well
sometimes
you
do
act
much
like
it
mm
i
guess
i
uh
got
an
awful
headache
tonight
damn
that
perfume
oh
said
marge
in
fact
i
thought
i
turn
in
early
and
get
some
sleep
sleep
said
marge
there
was
no
mistaking
the
disappointment
in
her
voice
now
i
knew
that
things
were
out
of
hand
the
next
evening
i
activated
george
prime
and
caught
the
taxi
at
the
corner
but
i
called
ruby
and
broke
my
date
with
her
i
took
in
an
early
movie
alone
and
was
back
by
ten
i
left
the
cab
at
the
corner
and
walked
quietly
up
the
path
toward
the
garage
then
i
stopped
i
could
see
marge
and
george
prime
through
the
living
room
windows
george
prime
was
kissing
my
wife
the
way
i
had
kissed
her
in
eight
long
years
it
made
my
hair
stand
on
end
and
marge
was
exactly
fighting
him
off
either
she
was
coming
back
for
more
after
a
little
the
lights
went
off
george
prime
was
a
super
deluxe
model
all
right
i
dashed
into
the
workshop
and
punched
the
recall
button
as
hard
as
i
could
swearing
under
my
breath
how
long
had
this
been
going
on
i
punched
the
button
again
viciously
and
waited
george
prime
did
come
out
it
was
plenty
cold
out
in
the
workshop
that
night
and
i
did
sleep
a
wink
about
dawn
out
came
george
prime
looking
like
a
man
with
a
hangover
our
conversation
got
down
to
fundamentals
george
prime
kept
insisting
blandly
that
according
to
my
own
directions
he
was
to
pick
the
first
logical
opportunity
to
come
out
when
i
buzzed
and
that
was
exactly
what
he
done
i
was
furious
all
the
way
to
work
i
take
care
of
this
nonsense
all
right
i
have
george
prime
rewired
from
top
to
bottom
as
soon
as
the
laboratory
could
take
him
but
i
never
phoned
the
laboratory
the
bank
was
calling
me
when
i
got
to
the
office
they
wanted
to
know
what
i
planned
to
do
about
that
check
of
mine
that
had
just
bounced
what
check
i
asked
the
one
you
wrote
to
cash
yesterday
five
hundred
dollars
against
your
regular
account
mr
faircloth
the
last
i
looked
i
had
about
three
thousand
dollars
in
that
account
i
told
the
man
so
rather
bluntly
oh
no
sir
that
is
you
until
last
week
but
all
these
checks
you
been
cashing
have
emptied
the
account
he
flashed
the
checks
on
the
desk
screen
my
signature
was
on
every
one
of
them
what
about
my
special
account
i
learned
long
before
that
an
account
marge
did
know
about
was
sound
strategy
that
been
closed
out
for
two
weeks
i
had
written
a
check
against
that
account
for
over
a
year
i
glared
at
the
ceiling
and
tried
to
think
things
through
i
came
up
with
a
horrible
thought
marge
had
always
had
her
heart
set
on
a
trip
to
bermuda
just
to
get
away
from
it
all
she
say
a
second
honeymoon
i
got
a
list
of
travel
agencies
from
the
business
directory
and
started
down
them
the
third
one
i
tried
had
a
pleasant
tenor
voice
no
sir
not
faircloth
bought
two
tickets
one
way
champagne
flight
to
bermuda
when
i
choked
out
why
today
as
a
matter
of
fact
it
leaves
idlewild
at
eleven
i
let
him
worry
about
my
amnesia
and
started
home
fast
i
did
know
what
they
given
that
prime
for
circuits
but
there
was
no
question
now
that
he
was
out
of
control
out
of
control
and
poor
marge
all
worked
up
for
a
second
honeymoon
then
it
struck
me
poor
marge
poor
sucker
george
no
prime
in
his
right
circuits
would
behave
this
way
without
some
human
guidance
and
that
meant
only
one
thing
marge
had
spotted
him
it
had
happened
before
couple
of
nasty
court
battles
i
read
about
and
she
known
all
about
george
prime
how
long
when
i
got
home
the
house
was
empty
george
prime
was
in
his
closet
and
marge
was
in
the
house
they
were
gone
i
started
to
call
the
police
but
caught
myself
just
in
time
i
could
very
well
complain
to
the
cops
that
my
wife
had
run
off
with
an
android
worse
yet
i
could
get
twenty
years
for
having
an
illegal
prime
wandering
around
i
sat
down
and
poured
myself
a
stiff
drink
my
own
wife
deserting
me
for
a
pile
of
bearings
it
was
indecent
then
i
heard
the
front
door
open
and
there
was
marge
her
arms
full
of
grocery
bundles
why
darling
you
home
early
i
just
blinked
for
a
moment
then
i
said
you
still
here
of
course
where
did
you
think
i
be
but
i
thought
i
mean
the
ticket
office
she
set
down
the
bundles
and
kissed
me
and
looked
up
into
my
eyes
almost
smiling
half
reproachful
you
did
really
think
i
go
running
off
with
something
out
of
a
lab
did
you
then
you
knew
certainly
i
knew
silly
you
did
do
a
very
good
job
of
instructing
him
either
you
gave
him
far
too
much
latitude
let
him
have
ideas
of
his
own
and
all
that
and
next
thing
i
knew
he
was
trying
to
get
me
to
run
off
with
him
to
hawaii
or
someplace
bermuda
i
said
and
then
marge
was
in
my
arms
kissing
me
and
snuggling
her
cheek
against
my
chest
even
though
he
looked
like
you
i
knew
he
could
be
she
said
he
was
like
you
but
he
was
darling
and
all
i
ever
want
is
you
i
just
never
appreciated
you
before
i
held
her
close
and
tried
to
keep
my
hands
from
shaking
george
faircloth
idiot
i
thought
she
never
been
more
beautiful
but
what
did
you
do
with
him
i
sent
him
back
to
the
factory
naturally
they
said
they
could
blot
him
out
and
use
him
over
again
but
let
not
talk
about
that
any
more
we
got
more
interesting
things
to
discuss
maybe
we
had
but
we
did
waste
a
lot
of
time
talking
it
was
the
marge
i
once
known
and
i
was
beginning
to
wonder
how
i
could
have
been
so
wrong
about
her
in
fact
unless
my
memory
was
getting
awfully
porous
the
old
marge
was
like
this
i
kissed
her
tenderly
and
ran
my
hands
through
her
hair
and
felt
the
depression
with
my
and
then
i
knew
what
had
really
happened
that
marge
always
had
been
a
sly
one
i
wondered
how
she
was
liking
things
in
bermuda
marge
probably
thought
she
really
put
me
where
i
belonged
but
the
laugh
was
on
her
after
all
as
i
said
the
old
marge
was
never
like
the
new
one
marge
prime
makes
jeree
and
sybil
and
dorothy
and
dawn
and
jane
and
ruby
all
look
pretty
sad
by
comparison
she
cooks
like
a
dream
and
she
always
brings
me
my
pipe
and
slippers
as
they
say
there
nothing
a
man
likes
more
than
to
be
appreciated
a
hundred
per
cent
appreciated
with
a
factory
guarantee
to
correct
any
slippage
which
would
only
be
temporary
anyhow
one
of
these
days
we
take
that
second
honeymoon
but
i
think
go
to
hawaii
