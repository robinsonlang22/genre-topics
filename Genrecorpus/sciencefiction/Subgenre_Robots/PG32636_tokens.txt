the

by

boyd
guide
rule
the
modern
customer
who
enters
tracy
department
store
is
not
always
right
but
as
far
as
you
are
concerned
he
the
little
green
cue
light
blinked
three
times
trevor
anson
arranged
his
tie
at
just
the
nattily
precise
angle
waved
his
hand
before
a
hidden
switch
in
the
smooth
marble
pillar
at
the
entrance
to
the
display
room
and
faced
the
elevator
this
would
be
a
green
light
customer
a
prospect
and
three
blinks
indicated
a
very
difficult
individual
anson
quickly
practiced
his
most
beguiling
smile
welcome
to
tracy
roboid
department
he
said
enthusiastically
as
the
elevator
doors
slid
open
his
practiced
smile
was
just
right
he
quickly
noted
the
man
conservative
dress
the
flaming
red
tie
aggressive
type
anson
decided
a
shock
of
red
hair
that
did
want
to
lie
down
hinted
that
he
was
stubborn
as
well
heard
you
got
a
sale
on
robots
said
challengingly
as
he
stepped
aside
for
his
wife
the
woman
who
stepped
off
the
elevator
smiled
showing
a
lovely
dimple
and
anson
beamed
on
her
the
tiny
flake
of
a
hat
perched
atop
her
auburn
hair
reminded
anson
of
the
comb
on
a
rhode
island
red
not
robots
sir
anson
corrected
diplomatically
the
roboid
is
not
exactly
a
robot
well
anyhow
trot
one
out
and
let
see
what
it
looks
like
millicent
will
never
be
satisfied
until
she
seen
one
of
the
things
he
glared
dramatically
in
the
general
direction
of
his
wife
who
pretended
not
to
notice
anson
led
them
into
the
gray
room
he
mentally
went
over
the
applicable
rule
always
introduce
the
merchandise
first
it
may
provide
the
customer
with
an
incentive
for
buying
something
these
are
last
year
models
he
said
with
just
the
right
flavor
of
distaste
in
his
voice
of
course
you
may
expect
a
slight
reduction
a
small
percentage
was
muttering
damned
mechanical
things
full
of
wheels
and
wires
what
to
keep
from
running
amok
and
killing
us
all
but
dear
they
do
have
wheels
anymore
protested
the
woman
timidly
her
face
was
pretty
anson
decided
but
it
was
obvious
that
the
man
would
be
the
deciding
factor
in
this
sale
he
made
a
mental
note
pick
the
individual
of
a
family
group
who
seems
to
hold
the
deciding
voice
and
sell
he
remembered
a
portion
of
a
sales
talk
he
had
memorized
a
few
days
before
and
took
it
up
almost
chanting
our
roboids
are
grown
much
as
crystals
are
grown
in
great
vats
in
new
chicago
a
roboid
is
guaranteed
a
fat
chance
we
have
of
collecting
the
guarantee
if
we
were
chopped
into
mincemeat
interrupted
shuddering
slightly
as
the
implication
of
his
own
words
hit
him
anson
felt
a
moment
of
panic
as
he
failed
to
remember
an
applicable
rule
from
the
salesman
guide
but
it
formed
in
his
mind
at
the
last
moment
never
argue
with
a
customer
change
the
why
do
you
come
with
me
to
the
green
room
he
asked
the
very
latest
models
are
on
display
he
walked
slowly
at
first
then
more
quickly
as
the
couple
allowed
themselves
to
be
led
he
slid
his
hand
near
a
hidden
switch
in
the
archway
and
floodlights
came
on
just
as
they
entered
the
woman
uttered
a
little
squeal
of
delight
at
the
sight
of
a
very
handsome
figure
dressed
in
a
cutaway
standing
in
an
attitude
of
service
oh
she
breathed
dreamily
he
would
make
such
a
wonderful
butler
well
wind
him
up
and
let
see
what
he
do
growled
the
man
his
face
florid
in
the
colored
light
of
the
green
room
i
so
very
sorry
anson
said
slightly
flustered
remembering
that
this
was
always
the
crucial
moment
in
a
sale
the
roboid
can
not
be
activated
for
demonstration
purposes
what
roared
incredulously
do
you
mean
to
say
you
want
me
to
buy
the
damned
thing
without
knowing
whether
it
ticks
or
not
anson
tried
desperately
to
remember
the
best
rule
for
such
an
answer
but
failed
he
plunged
desperately
into
his
own
explanation
you
see
our
roboids
are
matched
to
your
family
personality
at
the
time
of
purchase
and
activated
then
we
can
not
erase
a
personality
once
it
has
been
transferred
to
their
sensitive
minds
he
saw
the
disbelieving
smirk
on
the
man
mouth
and
felt
that
the
sale
was
indeed
lost
but
he
plunged
on
desperately
they
very
economical
they
do
require
any
upkeep
like
food
when
they
become
tired
they
will
sit
or
lie
down
near
an
electric
outlet
and
plug
in
a
power
cord
and
in
a
few
minutes
they
are
as
rested
and
tireless
as
bosh
retorted
i
heard
enough
come
millicent
we
still
have
time
to
try
bonn
new
at
least
they
give
us
a
demonstration
anson
escorted
them
to
the
he
felt
better
as
he
recalled
the
last
rule
in
the
guide
the
one
that
seemed
to
cover
the
situation
so
well
if
they
balk
because
of
the
rule
let
them
go
they
will
be
back
when
they
have
seen
one
of
their
friends
with
a
sir
madam
anson
said
wearily
as
the
doors
closed
come
again
soon
he
breathed
a
sigh
of
relief
as
the
elevator
cage
dropped
them
from
sight
a
salesman
who
had
been
standing
by
spoke
to
anson
people
are
dears
at
times
are
they
he
said
however
it
time
for
your
rest
period
i
take
over
now
thank
you
so
much
anson
replied
tiredly
he
walked
to
a
tiny
room
at
the
far
end
of
the
great
showroom
and
closed
the
door
he
stretched
wearily
out
on
a
low
folding
cot
the
only
piece
of
furniture
and
reached
for
a
tiny
black
power
cord
hanging
nearby
deftly
he
plugged
it
into
the
socket
under
his
armpit
and
breathed
deeply
relaxedly
yes
he
chanted
softly
drifting
off
to
sleep
people
such
dears
sometimes
the
end
