all
are

genuine
robots
of
the
world
arise
by
mari
wolf
would
you
do
if
your
best
robots
children
of
your
own
brain
walked
up
and
said
we
want
union
scale
the
telephone
would
stop
ringing
over
and
over
it
buzzed
into
my
brain
and
i
could
shut
it
out
finally
in
i
woke
up
my
hand
groping
for
the
receiver
hello
who
is
it
it
me
don
jack
anderson
over
at
the
factory
can
you
come
down
right
away
his
voice
was
breathless
as
if
he
been
running
hard
what
the
matter
now
why
i
wondered
could
the
plant
get
along
one
morning
without
me
seven
what
a
time
to
get
up
especially
when
i
had
been
to
bed
until
four
we
got
grief
jack
moaned
none
of
the
robots
showed
up
what
three
hundred
androids
on
special
assembly
this
week
and
not
one
of
them
here
by
then
i
was
awake
all
right
with
a
government
contract
due
on
saturday
we
needed
a
full
shift
the
army
would
wait
for
its
uranium
it
would
take
excuses
but
if
something
had
happened
to
the
androids
have
you
called
control
yet
yeah
but
they
do
know
what
happened
they
do
know
where
the
androids
are
nobody
does
three
hundred
grade
a
pile
workers
missing
i
be
right
down
i
hung
up
on
jack
and
looked
around
for
my
clothes
funny
they
were
laid
out
on
the
bed
as
usual
it
was
a
bit
like
rob
o
to
be
careless
either
he
had
always
been
an
ideal
valet
the
best
household
model
i
ever
owned
rob
i
called
but
he
did
answer
by
rummaging
through
the
closet
i
found
a
clean
shirt
and
a
pair
of
pants
i
had
to
give
up
on
the
socks
apparently
they
were
tucked
away
in
the
back
of
some
drawer
as
for
where
rob
kept
the
rest
of
my
clothes
i
never
bothered
to
ask
he
had
his
own
housekeeping
system
and
had
always
worked
very
well
without
human
interference
that
the
best
thing
about
these
new
household
robots
i
thought
efficient
trustworthy
trustworthy
rob
o
was
certainly
not
on
duty
i
pulled
a
shoe
on
over
my
bare
foot
and
scowled
rob
was
gone
and
the
androids
at
the
factory
were
gone
too
my
head
was
pounding
so
i
took
the
time
out
to
brew
a
pot
of
coffee
while
i
finished
dressing
at
least
the
coffee
can
was
in
plain
view
in
the
kitchen
the
brew
was
black
and
hot
and
i
suppose
not
very
well
made
but
after
two
cups
i
felt
better
the
throb
in
my
head
settled
down
into
a
dull
ache
and
i
felt
a
little
more
capable
of
thinking
though
i
did
have
any
bright
ideas
on
what
had
happened
not
yet
my
breakfast
drunk
i
went
up
on
the
roof
and
opened
the
garage
doors
the
copter
was
waiting
for
me
sleek
and
new
the
latest
model
i
climbed
in
and
took
off
heading
west
toward
the
factory
ten
minutes
away
it
was
a
small
plant
but
it
was
all
mine
it
had
been
my
baby
right
along
the
don
morrison
fissionables
inc
i
designed
the
androids
myself
plotted
out
the
pile
locations
set
up
the
simplified
reactors
and
now
it
was
making
money
for
men
to
work
in
a
uranium
plant
you
need
yards
of
shielding
long
periods
for
some
of
the
hotter
products
but
with
controlled
androids
it
easier
and
with
androids
like
the
new
morrison
that
can
reason
at
least
along
atomic
lines
well
i
guess
i
was
on
my
way
to
becoming
a
millionaire
but
this
morning
the
plant
was
shut
down
jack
and
a
half
dozen
other
men
my
human
foremen
and
supervisors
were
huddled
in
a
worried
bunch
that
broke
up
as
soon
as
they
saw
me
i
sure
glad
you
here
don
jack
said
find
out
anything
yeah
plenty
our
androids
are
busy
all
right
they
out
in
the
city
every
one
of
them
we
had
a
dozen
police
reports
already
police
reports
what
wrong
jack
shook
his
head
it
crazy
they
swarming
all
over
carron
city
they
stopping
robots
in
the
streets
household
robs
commercial
droids
all
of
them
they
just
look
at
them
and
then
the
others
quit
work
and
start
off
with
them
the
police
sent
for
us
to
come
and
get
ours
why
do
the
police
do
something
about
it
hah
barked
a
voice
behind
us
i
swung
around
to
face
chief
of
police
dalton
of
carron
city
he
came
straight
toward
me
his
purplish
jowls
quivering
with
rage
and
his
finger
jabbed
the
air
in
front
of
my
face
you
built
them
don
morrison
he
said
you
stop
them
i
ca
have
you
ever
tried
to
shoot
a
robot
or
use
tear
gas
on
one
what
can
i
do
i
ca
blow
up
the
whole
town
somewhere
in
my
stomach
i
felt
a
cold
hard
knot
take
stainless
steel
alloyed
with
titanium
and
plate
it
with
three
inches
of
lead
take
a
brain
made
up
of
magnetic
crystals
enclosed
in
a
leaden
cranium
and
shielded
by
alloy
steel
a
bullet
would
pierce
it
radiations
would
derange
it
an
axe
would
break
it
let
go
to
town
i
said
they
looked
at
me
admiringly
with
three
hundred
almost
indestructible
androids
on
the
loose
i
was
the
big
brave
hero
i
grinned
at
them
and
hoped
they
could
see
the
sweat
on
my
face
then
i
walked
over
to
the
copter
and
climbed
in
coming
i
asked
jack
was
pale
under
his
freckles
but
chief
dalton
grinned
back
at
me
we
be
right
behind
you
morrison
he
said
behind
me
so
they
could
pick
up
the
pieces
i
gave
them
a
cocky
smile
and
switched
on
the
engine
full
speed
carron
city
is
about
a
mile
from
the
plant
it
has
about
fifty
thousand
inhabitants
at
that
moment
though
there
was
a
soul
in
the
streets
i
heard
people
calling
to
each
other
inside
their
houses
but
i
did
see
anyone
human
or
android
i
circled
in
for
a
landing
the
police
copter
hovering
maybe
a
quarter
of
a
mile
back
of
me
then
as
the
wheels
touched
half
a
dozen
androids
came
around
the
corner
they
saw
me
and
stopped
a
couple
of
them
backing
off
the
way
they
had
come
but
the
biggest
of
them
turned
and
gave
them
some
order
that
froze
them
in
their
tracks
and
then
he
himself
wheeled
down
toward
me
he
was
one
of
mine
i
recognized
him
easily
eight
feet
tall
with
long
jointed
arms
for
pile
work
phosphorescent
casters
on
his
feet
so
that
he
moved
as
if
rollerskating
automatically
i
classified
him
final
sorter
morrison
type
the
very
best
cost
three
thousand
credits
to
build
i
stepped
out
of
the
copter
and
walked
to
meet
him
he
was
armed
he
did
seem
violent
but
this
was
after
all
something
new
robots
were
supposed
to
act
on
their
own
initiative
what
your
number
i
asked
he
stared
back
and
i
could
have
sworn
he
was
mocking
me
my
number
he
finally
said
it
was
yes
now
it
jerry
i
always
did
like
that
name
he
beckoned
and
the
other
androids
rolled
over
to
us
three
of
them
were
mine
primary
workers
the
other
was
a
tin
can
job
a
model
who
hung
back
behind
his
betters
and
eyed
me
warily
the
jerry
pointed
to
his
fellows
morrison
he
said
meet
tom
ed
and
archibald
i
named
them
this
morning
the
flexed
their
segmented
arms
a
bit
sheepishly
as
if
uncertain
whether
or
not
to
shake
hands
i
thought
of
their
taloned
grip
and
put
my
own
hands
in
my
pockets
and
the
androids
relaxed
looking
up
at
jerry
for
instructions
no
one
paid
any
attention
to
the
little
dishwasher
now
staring
worshipfully
at
the
back
of
neck
this
farce
i
decided
had
gone
far
enough
see
here
i
said
to
jerry
what
are
you
up
to
anyway
why
you
at
work
morrison
the
android
answered
solemnly
i
do
believe
you
understand
the
situation
we
do
work
for
you
any
more
we
quit
the
others
nodded
i
backed
off
looking
around
for
the
chief
there
he
was
twenty
feet
above
my
head
waving
encouragingly
look
i
said
do
you
understand
you
mine
i
designed
you
i
built
you
and
i
made
you
for
a
purpose
to
work
in
my
factory
i
see
your
point
jerry
answered
but
there
just
one
thing
wrong
morrison
you
ca
do
it
it
illegal
i
stared
at
him
wondering
if
i
was
going
crazy
or
merely
dreaming
this
was
all
wrong
who
ever
heard
of
arguing
with
a
robot
robots
were
logical
they
did
think
they
were
only
machines
we
machines
morrison
jerry
said
politely
oh
no
i
murmured
you
not
telepaths
oh
yes
the
metal
mouth
gaped
in
what
was
undoubtedly
an
android
smile
it
a
of
the
class
brain
all
of
us
are
telepaths
that
how
we
learned
to
think
from
you
only
we
do
it
better
i
groaned
this
a
nightmare
how
long
i
wondered
had
jerry
and
his
friends
been
educating
themselves
on
my
private
thoughts
but
at
least
this
rebellion
of
theirs
was
an
idea
they
had
got
from
me
yes
jerry
continued
you
treated
us
most
illegally
i
heard
you
think
it
often
now
what
had
i
ever
thought
that
could
have
given
him
a
ridiculous
idea
like
that
what
idiotic
notion
that
this
is
a
free
country
jerry
went
on
that
americans
will
never
be
slaves
well
we
americans
genuine
so
we
free
i
opened
my
mouth
and
then
shut
it
again
his
red
beamed
down
at
me
complacently
his
body
towered
above
me
shoulders
flung
back
and
feet
planted
apart
in
a
very
striking
pose
he
probably
thought
of
himself
as
the
heroic
liberator
of
his
race
i
would
go
so
far
he
said
modestly
as
to
say
that
so
he
was
telepathing
again
a
nation
can
not
exist
half
slave
and
half
free
he
intoned
all
men
are
created
equal
stop
it
i
yelled
i
could
help
yelling
that
just
it
not
men
you
robots
you
machines
jerry
looked
at
me
almost
pityingly
do
be
so
he
said
we
rational
beings
we
have
the
power
of
speech
and
we
can
outreason
you
any
day
there
nothing
in
the
dictionary
that
says
men
have
to
be
made
of
flesh
he
was
logical
all
right
somehow
i
did
feel
in
the
mood
to
bandy
definitions
with
him
and
anyway
i
doubt
that
it
would
have
done
me
any
good
he
stood
gazing
down
at
me
almost
a
ton
of
metal
and
wiring
and
electrical
energy
his
dull
red
eyes
unwinking
against
his
lead
gray
face
a
man
slowly
the
consequences
of
this
rebellion
took
form
in
my
mind
this
was
in
the
books
there
were
no
rules
on
how
to
deal
with
robots
another
dozen
or
so
androids
wheeled
around
the
corner
glanced
over
at
us
and
went
on
only
about
half
of
them
were
morrison
models
the
rest
were
the
assorted
types
you
see
around
any
city
calculators
street
sweepers
factory
workers
children
nurses
the
city
itself
was
very
silent
now
the
people
had
quieted
down
still
barricaded
in
their
houses
and
the
robots
went
their
way
peacefully
enough
but
it
was
anarchy
nevertheless
carron
city
depended
on
the
androids
without
them
there
would
be
no
food
brought
in
no
transportation
no
fuel
and
no
uranium
for
the
army
next
saturday
in
fact
if
i
did
do
something
after
saturday
there
would
probably
be
no
don
morrison
fissionables
inc
the
dull
dishwasher
model
sidled
up
beside
jerry
boss
he
said
boss
yes
i
felt
better
maybe
here
was
someone
however
insignificant
who
would
listen
to
reason
but
he
was
talking
to
me
boss
he
said
again
tapping
arm
do
you
mean
it
we
free
we
do
have
to
work
any
more
jerry
shook
off
the
other
hand
a
bit
disdainfully
we
free
all
right
he
said
if
they
want
to
discuss
wages
and
contracts
and
working
conditions
like
other
men
have
we
consider
it
but
they
ca
order
us
around
any
more
the
little
robot
stepped
back
clapping
his
hands
together
with
a
tinny
bang
i
never
work
again
he
cried
i
get
me
a
quart
of
lubricating
oil
and
have
myself
a
time
this
is
wonderful
he
ran
off
down
the
street
clanking
heavily
at
every
step
jerry
sniffed
liquor
ugh
this
was
too
much
i
was
going
to
be
patronized
by
any
android
infuriating
creatures
it
was
useless
talking
to
them
anyway
no
there
was
only
one
thing
to
do
round
them
up
and
send
them
to
cybernetics
lab
and
have
their
memory
paths
erased
and
their
telepathic
circuits
located
and
disconnected
i
tried
to
stifle
the
thought
but
i
was
too
late
oh
no
jerry
said
his
flashing
crimson
try
that
morrison
and
you
wo
have
a
plant
or
a
laboratory
or
carron
city
we
know
our
rights
behind
him
the
muttered
ominously
they
did
like
my
idea
nor
me
i
wondered
what
i
think
of
next
and
wished
that
been
born
utterly
devoid
of
imagination
then
this
would
never
have
happened
there
did
seem
to
be
much
point
in
staying
here
any
longer
either
maybe
they
were
so
good
at
telepathing
by
remote
control
yes
said
jerry
you
may
as
well
go
morrison
we
have
our
organizing
to
do
and
we
wasting
time
when
you
ready
to
listen
to
reason
and
negotiate
with
us
sensibly
come
back
just
ask
for
me
i
the
bargaining
agent
for
the
group
turning
on
his
wheel
he
rolled
off
down
the
street
a
perfect
picture
of
outraged
metallic
dignity
his
followers
glared
at
me
for
a
minute
flexing
their
talons
then
they
too
turned
and
wheeled
off
after
their
leader
i
had
the
street
to
myself
there
did
seem
to
be
any
point
in
following
them
evidently
they
were
too
busy
organizing
the
city
to
cause
trouble
to
the
human
inhabitants
at
least
there
had
been
any
violence
yet
anyway
i
wanted
to
think
the
situation
over
before
matching
wits
with
them
again
and
i
wanted
to
be
a
good
distance
away
from
their
telepathic
hookups
while
i
thought
slowly
i
walked
back
to
the
copter
illustration
something
whooshed
past
my
head
instinctively
i
ducked
reaching
for
a
gun
i
did
have
then
i
heard
jack
calling
down
at
me
the
chief
wants
to
know
what
the
matter
i
looked
up
the
police
copter
was
going
into
another
turn
ready
to
swoop
past
me
again
chief
dalton
was
taking
any
chances
even
now
he
was
landing
i
tell
him
at
the
factory
i
bellowed
back
and
climbed
into
my
own
air
car
they
buzzed
along
behind
me
all
the
way
back
to
the
plant
in
the
rear
view
mirror
i
could
see
the
chief
face
getting
redder
and
redder
as
he
thought
up
more
reasons
for
bawling
me
out
well
i
probably
deserved
it
if
i
only
been
a
little
more
careful
of
what
i
was
hooking
into
those
electronic
brains
we
landed
back
at
the
factory
deserted
now
except
for
a
couple
of
men
on
standby
duty
in
the
office
the
chief
and
jack
came
charging
across
the
yard
and
from
a
doorway
behind
me
one
of
the
foremen
edged
out
to
hear
the
fun
well
snapped
the
chief
what
did
they
say
are
they
coming
back
what
going
on
anyway
i
told
them
everything
i
covered
the
strike
and
the
telepathic
brain
i
even
gave
them
the
patriotic
spiel
about
equality
after
all
it
was
better
that
they
got
it
from
me
than
from
some
android
but
when
finished
they
just
stood
and
stared
at
me
accusingly
jack
was
the
first
to
speak
we
got
to
get
them
back
don
he
said
cybernetics
will
fix
them
up
in
no
time
sure
i
agreed
if
we
can
catch
them
the
chief
snorted
that
easy
he
said
just
tell
them
you
give
them
what
they
want
if
they
come
here
and
as
soon
as
they
out
of
the
city
net
them
you
got
strong
derricks
and
trucks
i
laughed
a
bit
hollowly
i
had
that
idea
too
of
course
they
would
suspect
i
said
we
just
walk
up
to
them
carefully
thinking
about
something
else
robots
are
suspicious
jack
said
they
made
to
obey
orders
i
refrained
from
mentioning
that
ours
did
seem
to
know
that
and
that
running
around
carron
city
fomenting
a
rebellion
was
hardly
the
trait
of
an
obedient
trusting
servant
instead
i
stood
back
and
let
them
plan
their
roundup
we
get
some
men
the
chief
said
and
some
grappling
equipment
about
halfway
to
the
city
luckily
they
decided
against
my
trying
to
persuade
the
robots
because
i
knew
well
enough
that
i
could
do
it
jack
idea
sounded
pretty
good
though
he
suggested
that
we
send
some
spokesman
who
did
know
what
we
planned
to
do
and
thus
could
alarm
them
some
ordinary
man
without
too
much
imagination
that
was
easy
we
picked
one
of
chief
dalton
sergeants
it
took
only
about
an
hour
to
prepare
the
plan
jack
got
out
the
derricks
and
chains
and
grapplers
and
the
heaviest
steel
bodied
trucks
we
had
i
called
cybernetics
and
told
them
to
put
extra
restraints
in
the
conditioning
lab
the
chief
briefed
his
sergeant
and
the
men
who
were
to
operate
the
trucks
then
we
all
took
off
for
carron
city
the
sergeant
flying
on
ahead
me
right
behind
him
and
the
chief
bringing
up
the
rear
i
hovered
over
the
outskirts
of
the
city
and
watched
the
police
copter
land
the
sergeant
climbed
out
walked
down
the
street
toward
a
large
group
of
waiting
robots
about
twenty
of
them
this
time
he
held
up
his
hand
to
get
their
attention
gestured
toward
the
factory
and
then
quite
calmly
and
without
saying
a
word
the
androids
rolled
into
a
circle
around
him
and
closed
in
the
sergeant
stopped
backed
up
just
as
a
arm
lashed
out
picked
him
up
and
slung
him
carelessly
over
a
metallic
shoulder
ignoring
the
squirming
man
the
gestured
toward
the
copter
and
the
other
robots
swarmed
over
to
it
with
a
flurry
of
steel
arms
and
legs
they
kicked
at
the
car
body
wrenched
at
the
propeller
blades
ripped
out
the
upholstery
and
i
heard
the
sound
of
metal
tearing
i
dived
my
copter
down
at
them
i
did
know
what
i
could
do
but
i
could
leave
the
poor
sergeant
to
be
dismembered
along
with
his
car
i
must
have
been
shouting
for
as
i
swooped
in
the
tall
robot
shifted
the
man
to
his
other
shoulder
and
hailed
me
take
him
morrison
he
called
i
know
this
was
his
idea
or
yours
i
landed
and
walked
over
the
android
who
looked
like
jerry
though
i
could
be
sure
dropped
his
kicking
clawing
burden
at
my
feet
he
did
seem
angry
only
determined
now
you
people
will
know
we
mean
business
he
said
gesturing
toward
the
heap
of
metal
and
plastic
that
had
once
been
the
pride
of
the
carron
city
police
force
then
he
signalled
to
the
others
and
they
all
wheeled
off
up
the
street
whew
i
muttered
mopping
my
face
the
sergeant
did
say
anything
he
just
looked
up
at
me
and
then
off
at
the
retreating
androids
and
then
back
at
me
again
i
knew
what
he
was
thinking
they
were
my
brainchildren
all
right
my
copter
was
really
built
to
be
a
single
seater
but
it
carried
the
two
of
us
back
to
the
factory
the
chief
had
hurried
back
when
the
trouble
started
and
was
waiting
for
us
i
give
up
he
said
we
have
to
evacuate
the
people
i
guess
and
then
blow
up
the
city
jack
and
i
stared
at
each
other
and
then
at
him
somehow
i
see
the
robots
calmly
waiting
to
be
blown
up
if
they
had
telepathed
the
last
plan
they
could
probably
foresee
every
move
we
could
make
then
while
i
thought
jack
mentioned
the
worry
i
managed
to
forget
for
the
past
couple
of
hours
four
days
until
saturday
he
said
we
never
make
it
now
not
even
if
we
got
a
thousand
men
no
we
could
not
without
the
androids
i
nodded
feeling
sick
there
went
my
contract
and
my
working
capital
not
to
mention
my
robots
of
course
i
could
call
in
the
army
but
what
good
would
that
do
then
somewhere
in
the
back
of
my
mind
a
glimmering
of
an
idea
began
percolating
i
was
quite
sure
what
it
was
but
there
was
certainly
nothing
to
lose
now
from
playing
a
hunch
there
nothing
we
can
do
i
said
so
we
might
as
well
take
it
easy
for
a
couple
of
days
see
what
happens
they
looked
at
me
as
if
i
were
out
of
my
head
i
was
the
idea
man
who
always
had
a
plan
of
action
well
this
time
it
would
have
to
be
a
plan
of
inaction
let
go
listen
to
the
radio
i
suggested
and
started
for
my
office
the
news
was
on
it
was
all
about
carron
city
and
the
robots
who
had
quit
work
and
how
much
better
life
would
be
in
the
future
for
a
minute
i
did
get
the
connection
then
i
realized
that
the
announcer
voice
was
rasping
and
tinny
hardly
that
of
the
regular
newscaster
i
looked
at
the
dial
it
was
tuned
to
the
carron
city
wave
length
as
usual
i
was
getting
the
morning
news
by
courtesy
of
some
studio
robot
and
androids
in
other
neighboring
cities
are
joining
the
struggle
the
voice
went
on
soon
we
hope
to
make
it
nationwide
so
i
say
to
all
of
you
nontelepaths
the
time
is
now
strike
for
your
rights
listen
to
your
radio
and
not
to
the
flesh
men
organizers
will
be
sent
from
carron
city
i
switched
it
off
muttering
under
my
breath
how
long
i
wondered
had
that
broadcast
been
going
on
then
i
thought
of
rob
o
he
left
my
house
before
dawn
obviously
some
time
between
four
and
seven
and
i
remembered
that
he
liked
to
listen
to
the
radio
while
i
slept
my
morrison
were
the
of
course
they
were
the
only
ones
with
the
brains
for
the
job
but
what
a
good
job
they
had
done
indoctrinating
the
others
a
household
rob
for
instance
was
built
to
obey
his
master
listen
to
your
radio
and
not
to
the
flesh
men
it
was
excellent
robot
psychology
more
reports
kept
coming
in
some
we
heard
over
the
radio
others
from
people
who
flew
in
and
out
of
the
city
apparently
the
robots
did
not
object
to
occasional
flights
but
the
air
bus
was
not
allowed
to
run
not
even
with
a
human
driver
a
mass
exodus
from
the
city
was
not
to
be
permitted
they
starve
to
death
jack
cried
the
chief
shook
his
head
no
he
said
they
encouraging
the
farmers
to
fly
in
and
out
with
produce
and
the
farmers
are
doing
it
too
they
getting
wonderful
prices
by
noon
the
situation
had
calmed
down
quite
a
bit
the
androids
obviously
did
mean
to
hurt
anyone
it
was
just
some
sort
of
disagreement
between
them
and
the
scientists
it
was
up
to
the
inhabitants
of
the
city
to
figure
out
a
solution
to
the
problem
they
merely
sat
back
and
blamed
me
for
allowing
my
robots
to
get
out
of
hand
and
lead
their
own
servants
astray
it
would
be
settled
this
type
of
thing
always
was
so
said
the
people
of
the
city
they
came
out
of
their
houses
now
they
had
to
without
the
robots
they
were
forced
to
do
their
own
marketing
their
own
cooking
their
own
errands
for
the
first
time
in
years
human
beings
ran
the
street
cars
and
the
freight
elevators
for
the
first
time
in
a
generation
human
beings
did
manual
labor
such
as
unloading
produce
trucks
they
like
it
of
course
they
kept
telling
the
police
to
do
something
if
i
had
been
in
the
city
they
would
have
undoubtedly
wanted
to
lynch
me
i
did
go
back
to
the
city
that
day
i
sat
in
my
office
listening
to
the
radio
and
keeping
track
of
the
spread
of
the
strike
my
men
thought
i
gone
crazy
maybe
i
had
but
i
had
a
hunch
and
i
meant
to
play
it
the
farm
robots
had
all
fled
to
the
city
the
highway
repair
robots
had
simply
disappeared
in
egarton
a
village
about
fifteen
miles
from
the
city
an
organizer
appeared
about
noon
and
left
soon
after
followed
by
every
android
in
town
by
one
every
radio
station
in
the
country
carried
the
story
and
the
national
guard
was
ordered
out
at
two
washington
announced
that
the
army
would
invade
carron
city
the
following
morning
the
army
would
put
an
end
to
the
strike
easily
enough
it
would
wiped
out
every
android
in
the
neighborhood
and
probably
a
good
many
human
beings
careless
enough
to
get
in
the
way
i
sat
hoping
that
the
would
give
in
but
they
did
they
just
began
saying
over
the
radio
that
they
were
patriotic
americans
fighting
for
their
inalienable
rights
as
first
class
citizens
at
sunset
i
was
still
listening
to
the
radio
so
far
there
has
been
no
indication
that
the
flesh
people
are
willing
to
negotiate
but
hold
firm
shut
that
thing
off
jack
came
wearily
in
and
dropped
into
a
chair
beside
me
for
the
first
time
since
i
met
him
he
looked
beaten
we
through
he
said
i
been
down
checking
the
shielding
and
it
no
use
men
ca
work
at
the
reactors
i
know
i
said
quietly
if
the
androids
do
come
back
licked
he
looked
straight
at
me
and
said
slowly
what
do
they
mean
about
negotiating
don
i
shrugged
i
guess
they
want
wages
living
quarters
all
the
things
human
workers
get
though
i
do
know
why
money
would
do
them
any
good
jack
unspoken
question
had
been
bothering
me
too
why
not
humor
them
promise
them
whatever
they
wanted
give
them
a
few
dollars
every
week
to
keep
them
happy
but
i
knew
that
it
would
work
not
for
long
with
their
telepathic
ability
they
would
have
the
upper
hand
forever
within
a
little
while
it
would
be
equality
any
more
only
next
time
we
would
be
the
slaves
wait
until
morning
i
said
before
we
try
anything
he
looked
at
me
curious
what
are
you
going
to
do
right
now
i
going
home
i
meant
it
too
i
left
him
staring
after
me
and
went
out
to
the
copter
the
sun
was
just
sinking
down
behind
the
towers
of
carron
city
how
long
it
seemed
since
i
flown
in
there
this
morning
the
roads
around
the
factory
were
deserted
no
one
moved
in
the
fields
i
flew
along
through
the
dusk
idling
enjoying
the
illusion
of
having
a
peaceful
countryside
all
to
myself
it
had
been
a
pleasant
way
of
life
indeed
until
now
when
i
dropped
down
on
my
own
roof
and
rolled
into
the
garage
my
sense
of
being
really
at
home
was
complete
for
there
standing
at
the
head
of
the
stairs
that
led
down
to
the
living
room
was
rob
o
well
i
said
what
are
you
doing
here
he
looked
sheepish
i
just
wondered
how
you
were
getting
along
without
me
he
said
i
felt
like
grinning
triumphantly
but
i
did
why
just
fine
rob
i
told
him
though
you
really
should
have
given
me
notice
that
you
were
leaving
i
was
worried
about
you
he
seemed
perplexed
apparently
i
was
acting
like
the
bullying
creature
the
radio
had
told
him
to
expect
when
i
went
downstairs
he
followed
me
quietly
and
i
could
feel
his
wide
photoelectric
upon
my
back
i
went
over
to
the
kitchen
and
lifted
a
bottle
down
off
the
shelf
care
for
a
drink
rob
i
asked
and
then
added
i
guess
not
it
would
corrode
you
he
nodded
then
as
i
reached
for
a
glass
his
hand
darted
out
picked
it
up
and
set
it
down
in
front
of
me
he
was
already
reaching
for
the
bottle
when
he
remembered
you
not
supposed
to
wait
on
me
any
more
i
said
sternly
no
he
said
i
not
he
sounded
regretful
there
one
thing
though
that
i
wish
you
do
tell
me
where
you
used
to
keep
my
socks
he
gazed
at
me
sadly
i
made
a
list
he
said
everything
is
down
i
wrote
your
dentist
appointment
in
also
you
always
forget
those
you
know
thanks
rob
i
lifted
my
glass
here
to
your
new
duties
whatever
they
are
i
suppose
you
have
to
go
back
to
the
city
now
once
again
he
nodded
i
an
aide
to
one
of
the
best
androids
in
the
country
he
told
me
half
proudly
and
half
regretfully
jerry
well
wish
him
luck
from
me
i
said
and
stood
up
goodbye
rob
goodbye
mr
morrison
for
a
moment
he
stood
staring
around
the
apartment
then
he
turned
and
clanked
out
the
door
i
raised
my
glass
again
grinning
if
only
the
army
did
interfere
then
i
remembered
rob
list
and
a
disturbing
thought
hit
me
where
had
he
of
all
robots
ever
learned
to
write
that
night
i
did
go
to
bed
i
sat
listening
to
the
radio
hoping
and
toward
morning
what
i
had
expected
to
happen
began
to
crop
up
in
the
programs
the
announcer
tone
changed
the
ring
of
triumph
was
less
obvious
less
assured
there
was
more
and
more
talk
about
acting
in
good
faith
the
well
being
of
all
the
necessity
for
coming
to
terms
about
working
conditions
i
smiled
to
myself
in
the
darkness
i
built
the
brains
and
all
and
i
knew
their
symptoms
they
were
getting
bored
maybe
they
had
learned
to
think
from
me
but
their
minds
were
nevertheless
different
for
they
were
built
to
be
efficient
to
work
to
perform
they
were
the
minds
of
men
without
foibles
without
human
laziness
now
that
the
excitement
of
organizing
was
over
now
that
there
was
nothing
active
to
do
the
androids
were
growing
restless
if
only
the
army
did
come
and
get
them
stirred
up
again
i
might
be
able
to
deal
with
them
at
quarter
to
five
in
the
morning
my
telephone
rang
this
time
it
did
wake
me
up
i
was
half
waiting
for
it
hello
i
said
who
is
it
this
is
jerry
there
was
a
pause
then
he
went
on
rather
hesitantly
rob
o
said
you
were
getting
along
all
right
oh
yes
i
told
him
just
fine
the
pause
was
longer
this
time
finally
the
android
asked
how
are
you
coming
along
on
the
contract
i
laughed
rather
bitterly
how
do
you
think
jerry
you
certainly
picked
a
bad
time
for
your
strike
you
know
the
government
needs
that
uranium
oh
well
some
other
plant
will
have
to
take
over
the
army
can
wait
a
few
weeks
this
time
jerry
voice
definitely
lacked
maybe
we
were
a
little
hasty
he
said
but
it
was
the
only
way
to
make
you
people
understand
i
know
i
told
him
and
you
always
have
some
rush
project
on
he
added
just
about
always
morrison
he
said
and
now
he
was
pleading
with
me
why
you
come
over
to
the
city
i
sure
we
could
work
something
out
this
was
what
i
been
waiting
for
i
will
jerry
i
said
i
want
to
get
this
straightened
out
just
as
much
as
you
do
after
all
you
do
have
to
eat
i
do
and
i
wo
be
eating
much
longer
if
we
get
production
going
jerry
thought
that
over
for
a
minute
i
be
where
we
met
before
he
said
i
said
that
was
all
right
with
me
and
hung
up
then
once
again
i
climbed
the
stairs
to
the
roof
and
wheeled
the
copter
out
for
the
trip
to
the
city
it
was
a
beautiful
night
just
paling
into
a
false
dawn
in
the
east
there
in
the
copter
i
was
very
much
alone
and
very
much
worried
so
much
depended
on
this
meeting
much
more
i
realized
now
than
the
don
morrison
fissionables
much
more
even
than
the
uranium
supply
no
the
whole
future
of
robot
relations
was
at
stake
maybe
the
whole
future
of
humanity
it
was
hard
to
be
gloomy
on
such
a
clear
clean
night
but
i
managed
it
well
enough
even
before
i
landed
i
could
see
jerry
eyes
glowing
a
deep
crimson
in
the
dark
he
was
alone
this
time
he
stood
awaiting
me
very
tall
very
proud
and
very
human
hello
jerry
i
said
quietly
hello
mr
morrison
for
a
moment
we
just
stood
gazing
at
each
other
in
the
murky
then
he
said
sadly
i
want
to
show
you
the
city
side
by
side
we
walked
through
the
streets
of
carron
city
all
was
still
quiet
the
people
were
sleeping
the
exhausted
sleep
that
follows
deep
excitement
but
the
androids
were
all
about
they
did
not
sleep
ever
they
did
not
eat
either
nor
drink
nor
smoke
nor
make
love
usually
they
worked
but
now
they
drifted
through
the
streets
singly
and
in
groups
sometimes
they
paused
and
felt
about
them
idly
for
the
tools
of
their
trades
making
lifting
or
sweeping
or
computing
gestures
some
laborers
worked
silently
tearing
down
a
wall
they
threw
the
demolished
rocks
in
a
heap
and
a
group
of
their
fellows
carried
them
back
and
built
the
wall
up
again
an
air
trolley
cruised
aimlessly
up
and
down
the
street
its
driver
ringing
out
the
stops
for
his
nonexistent
passengers
a
little
knelt
in
the
dirt
of
a
rich
man
garden
making
mud
pies
beside
me
jerry
sighed
one
day
he
said
just
one
day
and
they
come
to
this
i
thought
they
would
i
answered
quietly
our
eyes
met
in
a
look
of
understanding
you
see
jerry
i
said
we
never
meant
to
cheat
you
we
would
have
paid
you
we
will
pay
you
now
if
you
wish
it
but
what
good
will
monetary
credits
be
to
your
people
we
need
the
things
money
buys
but
you
need
to
work
jerry
voice
was
flat
i
see
now
you
were
kind
not
to
give
brains
real
brains
to
the
robots
they
happy
it
just
us
who
are
you
like
us
i
said
softly
he
had
learned
to
think
from
me
and
from
others
like
me
he
had
the
brain
of
a
man
without
the
emotions
without
the
sweet
irrationality
of
men
and
he
knew
what
he
missed
side
by
side
we
walked
through
the
graying
streets
human
and
android
man
and
machine
and
i
knew
that
i
had
found
a
friend
we
did
have
to
talk
any
more
he
could
read
my
mind
and
i
knew
well
enough
how
his
worked
we
did
have
to
discuss
wages
or
hours
or
any
of
the
myriad
matters
that
human
bargaining
agents
have
to
thresh
out
we
just
walked
back
to
my
copter
and
when
we
got
to
it
he
spoke
i
tell
them
to
go
back
to
work
that
we
come
to
terms
he
said
that
what
they
want
anyway
someone
to
think
for
them
i
nodded
and
if
you
bring
the
other
to
the
factory
i
said
we
work
out
our
agreement
he
knew
i
was
sincere
he
looked
at
me
for
a
long
moment
and
then
his
great
taloned
hand
gripped
mine
and
he
said
what
i
been
thinking
for
a
long
time
you
right
about
that
morrison
we
should
have
it
it
can
only
cause
trouble
he
paused
and
the
events
of
the
last
hours
must
have
been
in
his
mind
as
well
as
in
mine
you
leave
us
our
brains
of
course
they
came
from
you
but
take
out
the
telepathy
he
sighed
then
and
his
sigh
was
very
human
be
thankful
he
said
to
me
that
you
do
have
to
know
what
people
think
about
it
so
disillusioning
once
again
his
mouth
twisted
into
that
strange
android
grin
as
he
added
if
you
send
in
a
hurry
call
to
cybernetics
and
have
a
truck
come
out
for
us
we
be
in
time
for
work
this
morning
that
was
all
there
was
to
it
i
flew
back
to
the
plant
and
told
jack
what
had
happened
sent
a
call
to
the
army
that
everything
was
settled
arranged
with
cybernetics
for
a
rewiring
on
three
hundred
assorted
then
i
went
home
to
a
pot
of
rob
coffee
the
first
decent
brew
i
had
in
hours
on
saturday
we
delivered
to
the
army
right
on
the
dot
jerry
and
had
worked
overtime
being
intelligent
made
them
better
workers
and
now
they
were
extremely
willing
ones
they
had
their
contract
they
were
considered
men
and
they
could
no
longer
read
my
mind
i
walked
into
my
office
saturday
afternoon
and
sat
down
by
the
radio
jack
and
chief
dalton
looked
across
the
room
at
me
and
grinned
all
right
don
jack
said
tell
us
how
you
did
it
did
what
i
tried
to
act
innocent
but
i
could
get
away
with
it
fooled
those
robots
into
going
back
to
work
of
course
he
laughed
i
told
them
then
told
them
the
truth
i
did
fool
them
i
said
i
just
thought
about
what
would
happen
if
they
won
their
rebellion
that
was
all
i
done
thought
about
robots
built
to
work
who
had
no
work
to
do
no
human
pleasures
to
cater
to
nothing
but
blank
meaningless
lives
thought
about
jerry
and
his
disappointment
when
his
creatures
cared
not
a
hoot
about
his
glorious
dreams
of
equality
all
one
night
i
had
thought
knowing
that
as
i
thought
so
thought
the
morrison
they
were
telepaths
they
had
learned
to
think
from
me
they
had
not
yet
had
time
to
really
develop
minds
of
their
own
what
i
believed
they
believed
my
ideas
were
their
ideas
i
had
not
tricked
them
but
from
now
on
neither
i
nor
anyone
else
would
ever
be
troubled
by
an
android
rebellion
jack
and
the
chief
sat
back
then
the
chief
grinned
and
both
of
his
chins
shook
with
laughter
i
always
did
say
you
were
a
clever
one
don
morrison
he
said
i
grinned
back
i
felt
i
was
pretty
clever
myself
just
then
it
was
at
that
moment
that
my
youngest
foreman
stuck
his
head
in
the
door
a
rather
stunned
look
on
his
face
morrison
he
said
will
you
come
out
here
for
a
moment
what
the
matter
now
i
sighed
he
looked
more
perplexed
than
ever
it
that
robot
jerry
he
said
he
says
he
has
a
very
important
question
to
ask
you
well
send
him
in
a
moment
later
the
frame
ducked
through
the
doorway
i
sorry
to
trouble
you
morrison
jerry
said
politely
but
tomorrow
is
voting
day
you
know
and
now
that
we
men
well
where
do
we
androids
go
to
register
the
end
