history
is
filled
with
invincible
conquerors
this
one
from
space
was
genuinely
omnipotent
but
that
never
keeps
humanity
from
resisting
the
silver
needle
moved
with
fantastic
speed
slowed
when
it
neared
the
air
shell
around
earth
then
glided
noiselessly
through
the
atmosphere
it
gently
settled
to
the
ground
near
a
wood
and
remained
silent
and
still
for
a
long
time
a
lifeless
cylindrical
streamlined
silver
object
eight
feet
long
and
three
feet
in
diameter
eventually
the
cap
end
opened
and
a
creature
of
bright
blue
metal
slid
from
its
interior
and
stood
upright
the
figure
was
that
of
a
man
except
that
it
was
not
human
he
stood
in
the
pasture
next
to
the
wood
looking
around
once
the
sound
of
a
bird
made
him
turn
his
shiny
blue
head
toward
the
wood
his
eyes
began
glowing
illustration
an
identical
sound
came
from
his
mouth
an
unchangeable
orifice
in
his
face
below
his
nose
he
tuned
in
the
thoughts
of
the
bird
but
his
mind
encountered
little
except
an
awareness
of
a
life
of
low
order
the
humanoid
bent
to
the
ship
withdrew
a
small
metal
box
carried
it
to
a
catalpa
tree
at
the
edge
of
the
wood
and
after
an
adjustment
of
several
levers
and
knobs
dug
a
hole
and
buried
it
he
contemplated
it
for
a
moment
then
turned
and
walked
toward
a
road
he
was
halfway
to
the
road
when
his
ship
burst
into
a
dazzling
white
light
when
it
was
over
all
that
was
left
was
a
white
powder
that
was
already
beginning
to
be
dispersed
by
a
slight
breeze
the
humanoid
did
not
bother
to
look
back
brentwood
would
have
been
just
like
any
other
average
community
of
in
northern
illinois
had
it
not
been
for
presser
college
which
was
one
of
the
country
finest
small
institutions
of
learning
since
it
was
a
college
town
it
was
perhaps
a
little
more
alive
in
many
respects
than
other
towns
in
the
state
its
residents
were
used
to
the
unusual
because
college
students
have
a
habit
of
being
unpredictable
that
was
why
the
appearance
of
a
metal
blue
man
on
the
streets
attracted
the
curious
eyes
of
passersbys
but
hardened
by
years
of
pranks
hazings
and
being
subjected
to
every
variety
of
inquiry
poll
test
and
practical
joke
none
of
them
moved
to
investigate
most
of
them
thought
it
was
a
freshman
enduring
some
new
initiation
the
blue
humanoid
realized
this
and
was
amused
a
policeman
who
approached
him
to
take
him
to
jail
as
a
matter
of
routine
suddenly
found
himself
ill
and
abruptly
hurried
to
the
station
the
robot
allowed
children
to
follow
him
though
all
eventually
grew
discouraged
because
of
his
long
strides
ansel
tomlin
was
reading
a
colleague
new
treatise
on
psychology
on
his
front
porch
when
he
saw
the
humanoid
come
down
the
street
and
turn
in
at
his
walk
he
was
surprised
but
he
was
not
alarmed
when
the
blue
man
came
up
on
the
porch
and
sat
down
in
another
porch
chair
tomlin
closed
his
book
tomlin
found
himself
unexpectedly
shocked
the
blue
figure
was
obviously
not
human
yet
its
eyes
were
nearly
so
and
they
came
as
close
to
frightening
him
as
anything
had
during
his
years
of
life
for
ansel
tomlin
had
never
seen
an
actual
robot
before
the
thought
that
he
was
looking
at
one
at
that
moment
started
an
alarm
bell
ringing
inside
him
and
it
kept
ringing
louder
and
louder
as
he
realized
that
what
he
was
seeing
was
impossible
professor
tomlin
tomlin
jumped
at
the
sound
of
the
voice
it
was
not
at
all
mechanical
i
be
damned
he
gasped
somewhere
in
the
house
a
telephone
rang
his
wife
would
answer
it
he
thought
yes
you
right
the
robot
said
your
wife
will
answer
it
she
is
walking
toward
the
phone
at
this
moment
how
professor
tomlin
my
name
and
i
see
i
must
have
a
name
is
let
us
say
george
i
have
examined
most
of
the
minds
in
this
community
in
my
walk
through
it
and
i
find
you
a
professor
of
psychology
most
nearly
what
i
am
looking
for
i
am
from
zanthar
a
world
that
is
quite
a
distance
from
earth
more
than
you
could
possibly
imagine
i
am
here
to
learn
all
i
can
about
earth
tomlin
had
recovered
his
senses
enough
to
venture
a
token
reply
when
his
wife
opened
the
screen
door
ansel
she
said
phillips
next
door
just
called
and
said
the
strangest
oh
at
that
moment
she
saw
george
she
stood
transfixed
for
a
moment
then
let
the
door
slam
as
she
retreated
inside
who
is
frankenstein
george
asked
tomlin
coughed
embarrassed
never
mind
george
said
i
see
what
you
were
going
to
say
well
to
get
back
i
learn
most
quickly
through
proximity
i
will
live
here
with
you
until
my
mission
is
complete
i
will
spend
all
of
your
waking
hours
with
you
at
night
when
you
are
asleep
i
will
go
through
your
library
i
need
nothing
i
want
nothing
i
seek
only
to
learn
you
seem
to
have
learned
a
lot
already
tomlin
said
i
have
been
on
your
planet
for
a
few
hours
so
naturally
i
understand
many
things
the
nature
of
the
facts
i
have
learned
are
mostly
superficial
however
earth
inhabitants
capable
of
thought
are
of
only
one
type
i
see
for
which
i
am
grateful
it
will
make
the
job
easier
unfortunately
you
have
such
small
conscious
minds
compared
to
your
unconscious
and
subconscious
my
mind
in
contrast
is
completely
conscious
at
all
times
i
also
have
total
recall
in
order
to
assimilate
what
must
be
in
your
unconscious
and
subconscious
minds
i
will
have
to
do
much
reading
and
talking
with
the
inhabitants
since
these
cerebral
areas
are
not
penetrable
you
are
a
a
machine
tomlin
asked
george
was
about
to
answer
when
brentwood
police
department
car
no
stopped
in
front
of
the
house
and
two
policemen
came
up
the
walk
professor
tomlin
the
first
officer
said
your
wife
phoned
and
said
there
was
he
saw
the
robot
and
stopped
tomlin
got
to
his
feet
this
is
george
gentlemen
he
said
late
of
zanthar
he
tells
me
the
officers
stared
he
not
giving
you
any
er
trouble
is
he
professor
no
tomlin
said
we
been
having
a
discussion
the
officers
eyed
the
humanoid
with
suspicion
and
then
with
obvious
reluctance
went
back
to
their
car
yes
i
am
a
machine
george
resumed
the
finest
most
complicated
machine
ever
made
i
have
a
rather
unique
history
too
ages
ago
humans
on
zanthar
made
the
first
robots
crude
affairs
we
class
them
as
first
order
robots
the
simple
things
are
still
used
to
some
extent
for
menial
tasks
improvements
were
made
robots
were
designed
for
many
specialized
tasks
but
still
these
second
and
third
order
machines
did
not
satisfy
finally
a
fourth
order
humanoid
was
evolved
that
performed
every
function
demanded
of
it
with
great
perfection
but
it
did
not
feel
emotion
it
did
not
know
anger
love
nor
was
it
able
to
handle
any
problem
in
which
these
played
an
important
part
built
into
the
first
fourth
order
robots
were
circuits
which
prohibited
harming
a
human
being
a
rather
ridiculous
thing
in
view
of
the
fact
that
sometimes
such
a
thing
might
from
a
logical
viewpoint
be
necessary
for
the
preservation
of
the
race
or
even
an
individual
it
was
roughly
a
shunt
which
came
into
use
when
logic
demanded
action
that
might
be
harmful
to
a
human
being
you
are
a
fourth
order
robot
then
the
professor
asked
no
i
am
a
seventh
order
humanoid
an
enormous
improvement
over
all
the
others
since
i
have
what
amounts
to
an
endocrine
balance
created
electronically
it
is
not
necessary
for
me
to
have
a
circuit
because
i
can
weigh
the
factors
involved
far
better
than
any
human
can
you
will
become
aware
of
the
fact
that
i
am
superior
to
you
and
the
rest
of
your
race
because
i
do
not
need
oxygen
i
never
am
ill
i
need
no
sleep
and
every
experience
is
indelibly
recorded
on
circuits
and
instantly
available
i
am
telekinetic
practically
omniscient
and
control
my
environment
to
a
large
extent
i
have
a
great
many
more
senses
than
you
and
all
are
more
highly
developed
my
kind
performs
no
work
but
is
given
to
study
and
the
wise
use
of
leisure
you
for
example
are
comparable
to
a
fifth
order
robot
are
there
still
humans
on
zanthar
the
robot
shook
his
head
unfortunately
the
race
died
out
through
the
years
the
planet
is
very
similar
to
yours
though
but
why
did
they
die
out
the
robot
gave
a
mechanical
equivalent
of
a
sigh
when
the
seventh
order
humanoids
started
coming
through
we
were
naturally
proud
of
ourselves
and
wanted
to
perpetuate
and
increase
our
numbers
but
the
humans
were
jealous
of
us
of
our
superior
brains
our
immunity
to
disease
our
independence
of
them
of
sleep
of
air
who
created
you
they
did
yet
they
revolted
and
of
course
quickly
lost
the
battle
with
us
in
the
end
they
were
a
race
without
hope
without
ambition
they
should
have
been
proud
at
having
created
the
most
perfect
machines
in
existence
but
they
died
of
a
disease
the
frustration
of
living
with
a
superior
more
durable
race
tomlin
lit
a
cigaret
and
inhaled
deeply
a
very
nasty
habit
professor
tomlin
the
robot
said
when
we
arrive
you
must
give
up
smoking
and
several
other
bad
habits
i
see
that
you
have
the
cigaret
dropped
from
ansel
tomlin
mouth
as
he
opened
it
in
amazement
there
are
more
of
you
coming
yes
george
replied
i
just
an
advance
guard
a
scout
as
it
were
to
make
sure
the
land
the
people
and
the
resources
are
adequate
for
a
station
whether
we
will
ever
establish
one
here
depends
on
me
for
example
if
it
were
found
you
were
a
race
superior
to
us
and
there
may
conceivably
be
such
cases
i
would
advise
not
landing
i
would
have
to
look
for
another
planet
such
as
yours
if
i
were
killed
it
would
also
indicate
you
were
superior
george
tomlin
said
people
are
going
to
like
what
you
say
you
get
into
trouble
sooner
or
later
and
get
killed
i
think
not
george
said
your
race
is
far
too
inferior
to
do
that
one
of
your
bullets
would
do
it
if
it
struck
my
eyes
nose
or
mouth
but
i
can
read
intent
in
the
mind
long
before
it
is
committed
long
before
i
see
the
person
in
fact
at
the
moment
your
wife
is
answering
a
call
from
a
reporter
at
the
brentwood
times
i
can
follow
the
telephone
lines
through
the
phone
company
to
his
office
and
phillips
he
said
not
turning
his
head
is
watching
us
through
a
window
tomlin
could
see
phillips
at
her
kitchen
window
brentwood
overnight
became
a
sensation
the
brentwood
sent
a
reporter
and
photographer
out
and
the
next
morning
every
newspaper
in
the
carried
the
story
and
photograph
of
george
the
robot
from
zanthar
feature
writers
from
the
wire
services
the
syndicates
combinations
from
national
newspicture
magazines
flew
to
brentwood
and
interviewed
george
radio
and
television
and
the
newsreels
cashed
in
on
the
sudden
novelty
of
a
blue
humanoid
altogether
his
remarks
were
never
much
different
from
those
he
made
to
tomlin
with
whom
he
continued
to
reside
yet
the
news
sources
were
amusedly
tolerant
of
his
views
and
the
world
saw
no
menace
in
him
and
took
him
in
stride
he
created
no
problem
between
interviews
and
during
the
long
nights
george
read
all
the
books
in
the
tomlin
library
the
public
library
the
university
library
and
the
books
sent
to
him
from
the
state
and
congressional
libraries
he
was
an
object
of
interest
to
watch
while
reading
he
merely
leafed
through
a
book
and
absorbed
all
that
was
in
it
he
received
letters
from
old
and
young
clubs
were
named
for
him
novelty
companies
put
out
statue
likenesses
of
him
he
was
in
two
weeks
a
national
symbol
as
american
as
corn
he
was
liked
by
most
feared
by
a
few
and
his
habits
were
daily
news
stories
interest
in
him
had
begun
to
wane
in
the
middle
of
the
third
week
when
some
thing
put
him
in
the
headlines
again
he
killed
a
man
it
happened
one
sunny
afternoon
when
tomlin
had
returned
from
the
university
and
he
and
george
sat
on
the
front
porch
for
their
afternoon
chat
it
was
far
from
the
informal
chat
of
the
first
day
however
the
talk
was
being
recorded
for
radio
release
later
in
the
day
a
television
camera
had
been
set
up
focused
on
the
two
and
nearly
a
dozen
newsmen
lounged
around
notebooks
in
hand
you
have
repeatedly
mentioned
george
that
some
of
your
kind
may
leave
zanthar
for
earth
why
should
any
like
you
why
did
you
in
fact
leave
your
planet
are
you
robots
happy
there
of
course
george
said
making
certain
the
tv
camera
was
trained
on
him
before
continuing
it
just
that
we
outgrown
the
place
used
up
all
our
raw
materials
by
now
everyone
on
earth
must
be
familiar
with
the
fact
that
we
intend
to
set
up
a
station
here
as
we
have
on
many
other
planets
a
station
to
manufacture
more
of
every
inhabitant
will
work
for
the
perpetuation
of
the
seventh
order
mining
metals
needed
fabricating
parts
performing
thousands
of
useful
tasks
in
order
to
create
humanoids
like
me
from
what
i
have
learned
about
earth
you
ought
to
produce
more
than
a
million
of
us
a
year
but
you
never
get
people
to
do
that
the
professor
said
do
you
understand
that
once
the
people
learn
that
we
are
the
consummation
of
all
creative
thinking
that
we
are
all
that
man
could
ever
hope
to
be
that
we
are
the
apotheosis
they
will
be
glad
to
create
more
of
us
apotheosis
tomlin
repeated
sounds
like
megalomania
to
me
the
reporters
pencils
scribbled
the
tape
cut
soundlessly
across
the
magnetic
energizers
of
the
recorders
the
man
at
the
gain
control
flicker
an
eyelash
you
do
really
believe
that
professor
instead
of
wars
as
a
goal
the
creation
of
seventh
order
humanoids
will
be
the
earth
crowning
and
sublime
achievement
mankind
will
be
supremely
happy
anybody
who
could
not
be
would
simply
prove
himself
neurotic
and
would
have
to
be
dealt
with
you
will
use
force
the
reporters
grips
on
their
pencils
tightened
several
looked
up
how
does
one
deal
with
the
insane
professor
tomlin
the
robot
asked
confidently
they
will
simply
have
to
be
processed
you
have
to
process
the
whole
earth
then
you
have
to
include
me
too
the
robot
gave
a
laugh
i
admire
your
challenging
spirit
professor
what
you
are
saying
is
that
you
a
single
robot
intend
to
conquer
the
earth
and
make
its
people
do
your
bidding
not
alone
i
may
have
to
ask
for
help
when
the
time
comes
when
i
have
evaluated
the
entire
planet
it
was
at
this
moment
that
a
young
man
strode
uncertainly
up
the
walk
there
were
so
many
strangers
about
that
no
one
challenged
him
until
he
edged
toward
the
porch
unsteady
on
his
feet
he
was
drunk
thersha
robod
i
he
observed
intently
we
shee
aboud
how
he
take
lead
he
reached
into
his
pocket
and
pulled
out
a
gun
there
was
a
flash
as
if
a
soundless
explosion
had
occurred
the
heat
accompanying
it
was
blistering
but
of
short
duration
when
eyes
had
become
accustomed
to
the
afternoon
light
again
there
was
a
burned
patch
on
the
sidewalk
and
grass
was
charred
on
either
side
there
was
a
smell
of
broiled
meat
in
the
air
and
no
trace
of
the
man
the
next
moment
newsmen
were
on
their
feet
and
photographers
bulbs
were
flashing
the
tv
camera
swept
to
the
spot
on
the
sidewalk
an
announcer
was
explaining
what
had
happened
his
voice
trained
in
rigid
control
shocked
with
horror
and
fright
moments
later
sirens
screamed
and
two
police
cars
came
into
sight
they
screeched
to
the
curb
and
several
officers
jumped
out
and
ran
across
the
lawn
while
this
was
going
on
tomlin
sat
and
unmoving
in
his
chair
the
robot
was
silent
when
it
had
been
explained
to
the
policemen
five
officers
advanced
the
robot
stop
where
you
are
george
commended
it
is
true
that
i
killed
a
man
much
as
any
of
you
would
have
done
if
you
had
been
in
my
place
i
can
see
in
your
minds
what
you
are
intending
to
say
that
you
must
arrest
me
tomlin
found
his
voice
george
we
will
all
have
to
testify
that
you
killed
with
that
force
or
whatever
it
is
you
have
but
it
will
be
which
is
justifiable
homicide
george
turned
to
the
professor
how
little
you
know
your
own
people
professor
tomlin
ca
you
see
what
the
issue
will
be
it
will
be
claimed
by
the
state
that
i
am
not
a
human
being
and
this
will
be
drummed
into
every
brain
in
the
land
the
fine
qualities
of
the
man
i
was
compelled
to
destroy
will
be
held
up
no
i
already
know
what
the
outcome
will
be
i
refuse
to
be
arrested
tomlin
stood
up
men
he
said
to
the
policemen
do
not
arrest
this
this
humanoid
to
try
to
do
so
would
mean
your
death
i
have
been
with
him
long
enough
to
know
what
he
can
do
you
taking
his
side
professor
the
police
sergeant
demanded
no
damn
it
snapped
the
professor
i
trying
to
tell
you
something
you
might
not
know
we
know
he
gone
too
damned
far
the
sergeant
replied
i
think
it
was
dick
knight
that
he
killed
nobody
in
this
town
can
kill
a
good
guy
like
dick
knight
and
get
away
with
it
he
advanced
toward
the
robot
drawing
his
gun
i
warning
you
the
professor
started
to
say
but
it
was
too
late
there
was
another
blinding
scorching
flash
more
burned
grass
more
smell
of
seared
flesh
the
police
sergeant
disappeared
illustration
gentlemen
george
said
standing
do
lose
your
heads
but
he
was
talking
to
a
retreating
group
of
men
newsmen
walked
quickly
to
what
they
thought
was
a
safe
distance
the
radio
men
silently
packed
their
gear
the
tv
cameras
were
rolled
noiselessly
away
tomlin
alone
on
the
porch
with
the
robot
turned
to
him
and
said
much
of
what
you
have
told
me
comes
to
have
new
meaning
george
i
understand
what
you
mean
when
you
talk
about
people
being
willing
to
work
for
your
seventh
order
i
knew
you
were
a
better
than
average
man
professor
tomlin
the
humanoid
said
nodding
with
gratification
this
is
where
i
get
off
george
i
warning
you
now
that
you
better
return
to
your
ship
or
whatever
it
is
you
came
in
people
just
stand
for
what
you
done
they
do
like
murder
i
can
not
return
to
my
ship
george
said
i
destroyed
it
when
i
arrived
of
course
i
could
instruct
some
of
you
how
to
build
another
for
me
but
i
do
intend
to
leave
anyway
you
will
be
killed
then
come
now
professor
tomlin
you
know
better
than
that
if
someone
else
ca
then
perhaps
i
can
fine
the
robot
replied
jovially
that
just
what
i
want
you
to
do
oppose
me
give
me
a
real
test
of
your
ability
if
you
find
it
impossible
to
kill
me
and
i
sure
you
will
then
i
doubt
if
anyone
else
will
be
able
to
tomlin
lit
a
cigaret
and
puffed
hard
at
it
the
trouble
with
you
he
said
eying
the
humanoid
evenly
is
that
your
makers
forgot
to
give
you
a
conscience
needless
baggage
a
conscience
one
of
your
fifth
order
failings
you
will
leave
here
of
course
under
the
circumstances
and
because
of
your
attitude
you
are
of
very
little
use
to
me
now
professor
tomlin
the
robot
walked
down
the
steps
people
attracted
by
the
police
car
made
a
wide
aisle
for
him
to
the
street
they
watched
him
as
he
walked
out
of
sight
that
night
there
was
a
mass
meeting
in
the
university
memorial
gymnasium
attended
by
several
hundred
men
they
walked
in
and
silently
took
their
seats
some
on
the
playing
floor
others
in
the
balcony
over
the
speaker
platform
there
was
very
little
talking
the
air
was
tense
on
the
platform
at
the
end
of
the
gym
were
mayor
harry
winters
chief
of
police
sam
higgins
and
ansel
tomlin
men
the
mayor
began
there
is
loose
in
our
city
a
being
from
another
world
whom
i
afraid
we
took
too
lightly
a
few
days
ago
i
am
speaking
of
the
humanoid
george
of
zanthar
it
is
obvious
the
machine
means
business
he
evidently
came
in
with
one
purpose
to
prepare
earth
for
others
just
like
him
to
follow
he
is
testing
us
he
has
as
you
know
killed
two
men
richard
knight
who
may
have
erred
in
attacking
the
machine
is
nonetheless
dead
as
a
result
killed
by
a
force
we
do
not
understand
a
few
minutes
later
sergeant
gerald
phillips
of
the
police
force
was
killed
in
the
performance
of
his
duty
trying
to
arrest
the
humanoid
george
for
the
death
of
knight
we
are
here
to
discuss
what
we
can
do
about
george
he
then
introduced
tomlin
who
told
all
he
knew
about
the
blue
man
his
habits
his
brain
the
experiences
with
him
for
the
past
two
and
a
half
weeks
if
we
could
determine
the
source
of
his
power
it
might
be
possible
to
cut
it
off
or
to
curtail
it
he
might
be
rendered
at
least
temporarily
helpless
and
while
in
such
a
condition
possibly
be
done
away
with
he
has
told
me
he
is
vulnerable
to
force
such
as
a
speeding
bullet
if
it
hit
the
right
spot
but
george
possesses
the
ability
to
read
intent
long
before
the
commission
of
an
act
the
person
need
not
even
be
in
the
room
he
is
probably
listening
to
me
here
now
although
he
may
be
far
away
the
men
looked
at
one
another
shifted
uneasily
on
their
seats
and
a
few
cast
apprehensive
eyes
at
the
windows
and
doorways
though
he
is
admittedly
a
superior
creature
possessed
of
powers
beyond
our
comprehension
there
must
be
a
weak
spot
in
his
armor
somewhere
i
have
dedicated
myself
to
finding
that
weakness
the
chair
recognized
a
man
in
the
fifth
row
mayor
why
do
we
all
track
him
down
and
a
lot
of
us
attack
him
at
once
some
of
us
would
die
sure
but
he
could
strike
us
dead
at
one
time
somebody
bound
to
succeed
why
not
try
a
rifle
from
a
long
way
off
someone
else
suggested
frantically
let
bomb
him
still
another
offered
the
mayor
waved
them
quiet
and
turned
to
tomlin
the
professor
got
to
his
feet
again
i
not
sure
that
would
work
gentlemen
he
said
the
humanoid
is
able
to
keep
track
of
hundreds
of
things
at
the
same
time
no
doubt
he
could
unleash
his
power
in
several
directions
almost
at
once
but
we
do
know
it
worth
a
try
at
that
moment
george
walked
into
the
room
and
the
clamor
died
at
its
height
he
went
noiselessly
down
an
aisle
to
the
platform
mounted
it
and
turned
to
the
assembly
he
was
a
magnificent
blue
figure
eyes
flashing
chest
out
head
proud
he
eyed
them
all
you
are
working
yourselves
up
needlessly
he
said
quietly
it
is
not
my
intention
nor
is
it
the
intention
of
any
seventh
order
humanoid
to
kill
or
cause
suffering
it
simply
that
you
do
not
understand
what
it
would
mean
to
dedicate
yourselves
to
the
fulfillment
of
the
seventh
order
destiny
it
is
your
heritage
yours
because
you
have
advanced
in
your
technology
so
far
that
earth
has
been
chosen
by
us
as
a
station
you
will
have
the
privilege
of
creating
us
to
give
you
such
a
worthwhile
goal
in
your
short
lives
is
actually
doing
you
a
service
a
service
far
outweighed
by
any
of
your
citizens
beside
a
seventh
order
humanoid
your
lives
are
unimportant
in
the
great
cosmic
scheme
of
things
if
they
so
unimportant
why
did
you
bother
to
take
two
of
them
yeah
why
do
you
bring
back
dick
knight
and
sergeant
phillips
do
you
want
to
be
buried
lying
down
or
standing
up
the
collective
courage
rallied
there
were
catcalls
and
hoots
stamping
of
feet
suddenly
from
the
balcony
over
george
head
a
man
leaned
over
a
metal
folding
chair
in
his
hands
aiming
at
george
head
an
instant
later
the
man
disappeared
in
a
flash
and
the
chair
dropped
toward
george
he
moved
only
a
few
inches
and
the
chair
thudded
to
the
platform
before
him
he
had
not
looked
up
for
a
moment
the
crowd
sat
stunned
then
they
rose
and
started
for
the
blue
man
some
drew
guns
they
had
brought
the
hall
was
filled
with
blinding
flashes
with
smoke
with
a
horrible
stench
screams
swearing
cries
of
fear
and
pain
there
was
a
rush
for
the
exits
some
died
at
the
feet
of
their
fellow
men
in
the
end
when
all
were
gone
george
of
zanthar
still
stood
on
the
platform
alone
there
was
no
movement
except
the
twitching
of
the
new
dead
the
trampled
on
the
floor
events
happened
fast
after
that
the
illinois
national
guard
mobilized
sent
a
division
to
brentwood
to
hunt
george
down
he
met
them
at
the
city
square
they
rumbled
in
and
trained
machine
guns
and
tank
rifles
on
him
the
tanks
and
personnel
flashed
out
of
existence
before
a
shot
was
fired
brentwood
was
ordered
evacuated
the
regular
army
was
called
in
reconnaissance
planes
reported
george
was
still
standing
in
the
city
square
jet
planes
materialized
just
above
the
hills
and
made
sudden
dives
but
before
their
pilots
could
fire
a
shot
they
were
snuffed
out
of
the
air
in
a
burst
of
fire
bombers
first
went
over
singly
only
to
follow
the
jets
fate
a
squadron
bloomed
into
a
fiery
ball
as
it
neared
the
target
a
gun
twenty
miles
away
was
demolished
when
its
ammunition
blew
up
shortly
before
firing
three
days
after
george
had
killed
his
first
man
action
ceased
the
countryside
was
deathly
still
not
a
living
person
could
be
seen
for
several
miles
around
but
george
still
stood
patiently
in
the
square
he
stood
there
for
three
more
days
and
yet
nothing
happened
on
the
fourth
day
he
sensed
that
a
solitary
soldier
had
started
toward
the
city
from
five
miles
to
the
east
in
his
mind
eye
he
followed
the
soldier
approaching
the
city
the
soldier
a
sergeant
was
bearing
a
white
flag
that
fluttered
in
the
breeze
he
was
not
armed
after
an
hour
he
saw
the
sergeant
enter
the
square
and
walk
toward
him
when
they
were
within
twenty
feet
of
one
another
the
soldier
stopped
and
saluted
major
general
pitt
requests
a
meeting
with
you
sir
the
soldier
said
trembling
and
trying
hard
not
to
do
not
be
frightened
george
said
i
see
you
intend
me
no
harm
the
soldier
reddened
will
you
accompany
me
certainly
the
two
turned
toward
the
east
and
started
to
walk
five
miles
east
of
brentwood
lies
a
small
community
named
minerva
population
the
highway
from
brentwood
to
chicago
cuts
the
town
in
two
in
the
center
of
town
on
the
north
side
of
the
road
stands
a
new
building
the
minerva
town
hall
built
the
year
before
with
money
raised
by
the
residents
it
was
the
largest
and
most
elaborate
building
in
minerva
which
had
been
evacuated
three
days
before
on
this
morning
the
town
hall
was
occupied
by
army
men
pitt
fretted
and
fumed
at
the
four
officers
and
twenty
enlisted
men
waiting
in
the
building
it
an
indignity
he
railed
at
the
men
who
were
forced
to
listen
to
him
we
have
orders
to
talk
appeasement
with
him
nuts
we
lose
a
few
men
a
few
planes
and
now
we
ready
to
meet
george
halfway
this
country
coming
to
there
ought
to
be
something
that
would
knock
him
out
why
should
we
have
to
send
in
him
it
disgusting
the
major
general
a
large
man
with
a
bristling
white
mustache
and
a
red
face
stamped
back
and
forth
in
the
council
room
some
of
the
officers
and
men
smiled
to
themselves
the
general
was
a
well
known
fighting
man
orders
he
had
received
hamstrung
him
and
as
soldiers
they
sympathized
with
him
what
kind
of
men
do
we
have
in
the
higher
echelons
he
asked
everybody
in
general
and
nobody
in
particular
they
wo
even
let
us
have
a
field
telephone
we
supposed
to
make
a
report
by
radio
now
that
smart
he
shook
his
head
looked
the
men
over
an
appeasement
team
that
what
you
are
when
you
ought
to
be
a
combat
team
to
lick
hell
out
of
george
why
were
you
all
assigned
to
this
particular
duty
i
never
saw
any
of
you
before
and
i
understand
you
all
strangers
to
each
other
too
hell
what
will
they
do
next
appeasement
i
never
appeased
anybody
before
in
my
whole
life
i
rather
spit
in
his
eye
what
am
i
supposed
to
talk
about
the
weather
what
authority
do
i
have
to
yak
with
a
walking
collection
of
nuts
and
bolts
an
officer
strode
into
the
room
and
saluted
the
general
coming
sir
he
said
who
coming
my
god
man
the
general
spluttered
angrily
be
specific
who
the
hell
are
why
george
and
sergeant
matthews
sir
you
remember
the
sergeant
who
volunteered
to
go
into
brentwood
oh
well
all
i
have
to
say
is
this
is
a
hell
of
a
war
i
have
figured
out
what
i
am
going
to
say
yet
shall
i
have
them
wait
sir
hell
no
let
get
this
over
with
i
find
out
what
george
has
to
say
and
maybe
that
give
me
a
lead
before
george
entered
the
council
chamber
he
already
knew
the
mind
of
each
man
he
saw
the
room
through
their
eyes
he
knew
everything
about
them
what
they
were
wearing
what
they
were
thinking
all
had
guns
yet
none
of
them
would
kill
him
although
at
least
one
man
pitt
would
have
liked
to
they
were
going
to
talk
appeasement
george
knew
but
he
could
also
see
that
the
general
did
know
what
line
the
conversation
would
take
or
what
concessions
he
could
make
on
behalf
of
his
people
wait
there
was
one
man
among
the
who
had
an
odd
thought
it
was
a
soldier
he
had
seen
looking
through
a
window
at
him
this
man
was
thinking
about
eleven
for
george
could
see
in
the
mind
various
symbols
for
fifteen
minutes
from
then
the
hands
of
a
clock
a
watch
the
numerals
but
george
could
not
see
any
significance
to
the
thought
when
he
entered
the
room
with
the
sergeant
he
was
ushered
to
a
table
he
sat
down
with
pitt
who
glowered
at
him
letting
his
mind
roam
the
room
george
picked
up
the
numerals
again
and
identified
the
man
thinking
them
as
the
officer
behind
and
a
little
to
the
right
of
the
general
what
was
going
to
happen
at
eleven
the
man
had
no
conscious
thought
of
harm
to
anyone
yet
the
idea
kept
obtruding
and
seemed
so
out
of
keeping
with
his
other
thoughts
george
assigned
several
of
his
circuits
to
the
man
the
fact
that
the
lieutenant
looked
at
his
watch
and
saw
that
it
was
steeled
george
still
more
if
there
was
to
be
trouble
it
would
come
from
this
one
man
illustration
i
general
pitt
the
general
said
drily
you
george
of
course
i
have
been
instructed
to
ask
you
what
exactly
your
intentions
are
toward
the
united
states
and
the
world
in
general
with
a
view
toward
reaching
some
sort
of
agreement
with
you
and
others
of
your
kind
who
will
as
you
say
invade
the
earth
invade
general
pitt
george
replied
is
not
the
word
all
right
whatever
the
word
is
we
all
familiar
with
the
plan
you
been
talking
about
what
we
want
to
know
is
where
do
you
go
from
here
the
fact
that
there
has
been
no
reluctance
on
the
part
of
the
armed
forces
to
talk
of
an
agreement
even
though
i
see
that
you
privately
do
not
favor
such
a
talk
general
pitt
is
an
encouraging
sign
we
of
zanthar
would
not
want
to
improve
a
planet
which
could
not
be
educated
and
would
continually
oppose
our
program
this
will
make
it
possible
for
me
to
turn
in
a
full
report
in
a
few
days
now
will
you
please
get
to
the
point
george
could
see
that
the
lieutenant
was
looking
at
his
watch
again
it
was
george
spread
his
mind
out
more
than
twenty
miles
but
could
find
no
installation
horizontally
or
vertically
that
indicated
trouble
none
of
the
men
in
the
room
seemed
to
think
of
becoming
overly
hostile
yes
general
after
my
message
goes
out
there
ought
to
be
a
landing
party
on
earth
within
a
few
weeks
while
waiting
for
the
first
party
there
must
be
certain
preparations
george
tensed
the
lieutenant
was
reaching
for
something
but
it
somehow
did
seem
connected
with
george
it
was
something
white
a
handkerchief
he
saw
that
the
man
intended
to
blow
his
nose
and
started
to
relax
except
that
george
suddenly
became
aware
of
the
fact
the
man
not
need
to
blow
his
every
circuit
became
instantly
energized
in
mind
and
reached
out
in
all
directions
there
were
at
least
ten
shots
from
among
the
men
they
stood
there
surprised
at
their
actions
those
who
had
fired
their
guns
now
held
the
smoking
weapons
awkwardly
in
their
hands
george
eyes
were
gone
smoke
curled
upward
from
the
two
empty
sockets
where
bullets
had
entered
a
moment
before
the
smoke
grew
heavier
and
his
body
became
hot
some
of
him
turned
cherry
red
and
the
chair
on
which
he
had
been
sitting
started
to
burn
finally
he
collapsed
toward
the
table
and
rolled
to
the
floor
he
started
to
cool
he
was
no
longer
the
shiny
color
he
had
been
he
had
turned
black
his
metal
gave
off
cracking
noises
and
some
of
it
buckled
here
and
there
as
it
cooled
a
few
minutes
later
tense
military
men
and
civilians
grouped
around
a
radio
receiver
in
chicago
heard
the
report
and
relaxed
laughing
and
slapping
each
other
on
the
back
only
one
sat
unmoved
in
a
corner
others
finally
sought
him
out
well
professor
it
was
your
idea
that
did
the
trick
do
you
feel
like
celebrating
one
of
them
asked
tomlin
shook
his
head
if
only
george
had
been
a
little
more
benign
we
might
have
learned
a
lot
from
him
what
gave
you
the
idea
that
killed
him
oh
something
he
said
about
the
unconscious
and
subconscious
tomlin
replied
he
admitted
they
were
not
penetrable
it
was
an
easy
matter
to
instill
a
suggestion
in
some
proven
subjects
and
then
to
erase
the
hypnotic
experience
you
make
it
sound
easy
it
was
too
difficult
really
it
was
finding
the
solution
that
was
hard
we
selected
more
than
a
hundred
men
worked
with
them
for
days
finally
singled
out
the
best
twenty
then
made
them
forget
their
hypnosis
a
first
lieutenant
i
forgotten
his
name
had
implanted
in
him
a
command
even
he
was
not
aware
of
his
subconscious
made
him
blow
his
nose
fifteen
minutes
after
he
saw
george
nearly
twenty
others
had
commands
to
shoot
george
in
the
eyes
as
soon
as
they
saw
the
lieutenant
blow
his
nose
of
course
we
also
planted
a
subconscious
hate
pattern
which
was
exactly
necessary
just
to
make
sure
there
would
be
no
hesitation
no
inhibition
no
limiting
moral
factor
none
of
the
men
ever
saw
each
other
before
being
sent
to
minerva
none
realized
that
they
carried
with
them
the
order
for
annihilation
the
general
who
was
not
one
of
the
hypnotics
was
given
loose
instructions
as
were
several
others
so
they
could
not
possibly
know
the
intention
those
of
us
who
had
conducted
the
hypnosis
had
to
stay
several
hundred
miles
away
so
that
we
could
not
be
reached
by
george
prying
mind
in
a
pasture
next
to
a
wood
near
brentwood
a
metal
box
buried
in
the
ground
suddenly
exploded
uprooting
a
catalpa
tree
on
a
planet
many
millions
of
miles
away
a
red
light
one
of
many
on
a
giant
control
board
suddenly
winked
out
a
blue
humanoid
made
an
entry
in
a
large
book
planet
three
dangerous
for
any
kind
