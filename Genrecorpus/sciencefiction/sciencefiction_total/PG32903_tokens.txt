sidenote
the
new
system
of
the
managerials
the
fight
was
not
for
life
but
for
death
and
great
was
the
ingenuity
of
the
charles
marquis
had
a
fraction
of
a
minute
in
which
to
die
he
dropped
through
the
tubular
beams
of
alloydem
steel
and
hung
there
five
thousand
feet
above
the
tiers
and
walkways
below
at
either
end
of
the
walkway
crossing
between
the
two
buildings
he
saw
the
plainclothes
security
officers
running
in
toward
him
he
grinned
and
started
to
release
his
grip
he
would
think
about
them
on
the
way
down
his
fingers
would
work
he
kicked
and
strained
and
tore
at
himself
with
his
own
weight
but
his
hands
were
his
own
any
more
he
might
have
anticipated
that
some
paralysis
beam
freezing
his
hands
into
the
metal
he
sagged
to
limpness
his
chin
dropped
for
an
instant
then
the
fire
in
his
heart
almost
went
out
but
not
quite
it
survived
that
one
terrible
moment
of
defeat
then
burned
higher
and
perhaps
something
in
that
desperate
resistance
was
the
factor
that
kept
it
burning
where
it
was
thought
no
flame
could
burn
he
felt
the
rigidity
of
paralysis
leaving
his
arms
as
he
was
lifted
helped
along
the
walkway
to
a
security
car
the
car
looked
like
any
other
car
the
officers
appeared
like
all
the
other
people
in
the
clockwork
culture
of
the
mechanized
new
system
marquis
sought
the
protection
of
personal
darkness
behind
closed
eyelids
as
the
monorail
car
moved
faster
and
faster
through
the
high
clean
air
well
he
worked
with
the
underground
against
the
system
for
a
long
time
he
had
known
that
eventually
he
would
be
caught
there
were
rumors
of
what
happened
to
men
then
and
even
the
vaguest
unsubstantiated
rumors
were
enough
to
indicate
that
death
was
preferable
that
was
the
underground
philosophy
better
to
die
standing
up
as
a
man
with
some
degree
of
personal
integrity
and
freedom
than
to
go
on
living
as
a
conditioned
slave
of
the
state
he
missed
but
he
was
through
yet
though
in
a
hollow
tooth
was
a
capsule
containing
a
very
poison
a
little
of
that
would
do
the
trick
too
but
he
would
have
to
wait
for
the
right
time
the
manager
was
thin
his
face
angular
and
he
matched
up
with
the
harsh
steel
angles
of
the
desk
and
the
big
room
somewhere
in
the
security
building
his
face
had
a
kind
of
emotion
cold
detached
cynically
superior
we
do
get
many
of
your
kind
he
said
political
prisoners
are
becoming
more
scarce
all
the
time
as
your
number
indicates
from
now
on
you
be
no
he
looked
at
some
papers
then
up
at
marquis
you
evidently
found
out
a
great
deal
however
none
of
it
will
do
you
or
what
remains
of
your
underground
fools
any
good
the
manager
studied
marquis
with
detached
curiosity
you
learned
things
concerning
the
managerials
that
have
so
far
remained
secret
it
was
partly
a
question
marquis
lean
and
darkly
inscrutable
face
smiled
slightly
you
good
at
understatement
yes
i
found
out
what
we
suspected
for
some
time
that
the
managerial
class
has
found
some
way
to
stay
young
either
a
remarkable
longevity
or
immortality
of
all
the
social
evils
that
the
worst
of
all
to
deny
the
people
knowledge
of
such
a
secret
the
manager
nodded
then
you
did
find
that
out
the
underground
knows
well
it
will
do
no
good
it
will
eventually
they
go
on
and
someday
they
learn
the
secret
marquis
thought
of
marden
marden
was
as
old
as
the
new
system
of
statism
and
inhumanity
that
had
started
off
disguised
as
and
three
years
old
to
be
exact
the
manager
said
no
you
will
be
sent
to
the
work
colony
on
the
moon
you
wo
be
back
we
tried
rebels
but
it
does
work
a
rebel
has
certain
basic
deviant
characteristics
and
we
ca
overcome
them
sufficiently
to
make
happy
workers
out
of
you
however
on
the
moon
you
will
conform
it
a
kind
of
social
experiment
there
in
associative
reflex
culture
you
might
say
conform
all
right
he
was
taken
to
a
small
naked
room
he
thought
about
taking
the
capsule
from
his
tooth
now
but
decided
he
might
be
observed
they
would
rush
in
an
antidote
and
make
him
live
and
he
might
not
get
a
chance
to
take
his
life
in
any
other
way
he
would
try
of
course
but
his
knowledge
of
his
future
situation
was
vague
except
that
in
it
he
would
conform
there
would
be
extreme
therapeutic
techniques
and
it
would
be
pretty
horrible
that
was
all
he
knew
he
did
see
the
pellet
fall
he
heard
the
slight
sound
it
made
and
then
saw
the
almost
colorless
gas
hissing
softly
clouding
the
room
he
tasted
nothing
smelled
or
felt
nothing
he
passed
out
quickly
and
painlessly
he
was
marched
into
another
office
and
he
knew
he
was
on
the
moon
the
far
wall
was
spherical
and
was
made
up
of
the
outer
shell
of
the
pressure
dome
which
kept
out
the
frigid
cold
nights
and
days
it
was
opaque
and
marquis
could
see
the
harsh
black
and
white
shadows
out
there
the
metallic
edges
of
the
far
crater
wall
this
manager
was
somewhat
fat
with
a
round
pink
face
and
cold
blue
eyes
he
sat
behind
a
chrome
shelf
of
odd
shape
suspended
from
the
ceiling
with
silver
wires
the
manager
said
no
here
there
is
only
work
at
first
of
course
you
will
rebel
later
you
will
work
and
finally
there
will
be
nothing
else
things
here
are
rigidly
scheduled
and
you
will
learn
the
routines
as
the
conditioning
bells
acquaint
you
with
them
we
are
completely
here
we
are
developing
the
perfect
society
it
is
a
kind
of
experiment
a
closed
system
to
test
to
what
extremes
we
can
carry
our
mastery
of
associative
reflex
to
bring
man
security
and
happiness
and
freedom
from
responsibility
marquis
did
say
anything
there
was
nothing
to
say
he
knew
he
could
get
away
with
trying
to
kill
this
particular
managerial
specimen
but
one
man
alone
a
rebel
with
something
left
in
him
that
still
burned
could
beat
the
system
had
to
our
work
here
is
specialized
during
the
indoctrination
period
you
will
do
a
very
simple
routine
job
in
coordination
with
the
cybernetics
machines
there
the
machines
and
the
nervous
system
of
the
workers
become
slowly
cooperative
machine
and
man
learn
to
work
very
intimately
together
later
after
the
indoctrination
because
of
your
specialized
knowledge
of
preparation
we
will
transfer
you
to
the
the
period
of
indoctrination
varies
in
length
with
the
individuals
you
will
be
screened
now
and
taken
to
the
indoctrination
ward
we
probably
wo
be
seeing
one
another
again
the
bells
take
care
of
everything
here
the
bells
and
the
machines
there
is
never
an
error
never
any
mistakes
machines
do
not
make
mistakes
he
was
marched
out
of
there
and
through
a
series
of
rooms
he
was
taken
in
by
generators
huge
oscilloscopes
spun
like
a
living
tube
through
curtains
of
vacuum
tube
voltimeters
electronic
power
panels
twisted
and
squeezed
through
rolls
of
skeins
of
wire
bent
through
shieldings
of
every
color
size
and
shape
rolled
over
panel
plates
huge
racks
of
glowing
tubes
elaborate
transceivers
tumbled
down
long
surfaces
of
gleaming
bakelite
plunged
through
files
of
resistors
and
capacitances
here
machine
and
man
learn
to
work
very
intimately
as
he
drifted
through
the
machine
tooled
nightmare
marquis
knew
he
had
been
fighting
all
his
life
what
he
would
continue
to
fight
with
every
grain
of
ingenuity
mechanization
the
horror
of
losing
identity
and
becoming
part
of
an
assembly
line
he
could
hear
a
clicking
sound
as
tubes
sharpened
and
faded
in
intensity
the
clicking
rhythm
a
hypnotic
rhythm
like
the
beating
of
his
own
heart
the
throbbing
and
thrumming
the
contracting
and
expanding
the
pulsing
and
pounding
the
machines
and
the
nervous
system
of
the
workers
become
slowly
beds
were
spaced
ten
feet
apart
down
both
sides
of
a
long
gray
metal
hall
there
were
no
cells
no
privacy
nothing
but
beds
and
the
gray
metalene
suits
with
numbers
printed
across
the
chest
his
bed
with
his
number
printed
above
it
was
indicated
to
him
and
the
guard
disappeared
he
was
alone
it
was
absolutely
silent
on
his
right
a
woman
lay
on
a
bed
no
she
had
been
here
a
long
time
she
appeared
dead
her
breasts
rose
and
fell
with
a
peculiarly
steady
rhythm
and
seemed
to
be
coordinated
with
the
silent
invisible
throbbing
of
the
metal
walls
she
might
have
been
attractive
once
here
it
did
make
any
difference
her
face
was
gray
like
metal
her
hair
was
cropped
short
her
uniform
was
the
same
as
the
man
on
left
the
man
was
no
he
had
been
here
so
long
his
face
was
thin
and
gray
his
hair
was
dark
and
he
was
about
the
same
size
and
build
as
marquis
his
mouth
hung
slightly
open
and
his
eyes
were
closed
and
there
was
a
slight
quivering
at
the
ends
of
the
fingers
which
were
laced
across
his
stomach
illustration
the
bells
rang
they
would
arise
hello
marquis
said
the
man
shivered
then
opened
dull
eyes
and
looked
up
at
marquis
i
just
got
in
name
charles
marquis
the
man
blinked
i
i
no
he
looked
down
at
his
chest
repeated
the
number
his
fingers
shook
a
little
as
he
touched
his
lips
marquis
said
what
this
indoctrination
you
learn
the
bells
ring
you
forget
and
learn
there
absolutely
no
chance
of
escaping
marquis
whispered
more
to
himself
than
to
only
by
dying
shivered
his
eyes
rolled
crazily
then
he
turned
over
and
buried
his
face
in
his
arms
the
situation
had
twisted
all
the
old
accepted
values
squarely
around
preferring
death
over
life
but
not
because
of
any
attitude
or
pessimism
or
defeatism
none
of
those
negative
attitudes
that
would
have
made
the
abnormal
under
conditions
in
which
there
would
have
been
hope
and
some
faint
chance
of
a
bearable
future
here
to
keep
on
living
was
a
final
form
of
indignity
of
humiliation
of
ignominy
of
the
worst
thing
of
all
loss
of
of
individuality
to
die
as
a
human
being
was
much
more
preferable
over
continuing
to
live
as
something
else
something
neither
human
or
machine
but
something
of
both
with
none
of
the
dignity
of
either
the
screening
process
had
detected
the
capsule
of
poison
in
tooth
the
capsule
contained
ten
grains
of
poison
only
one
of
which
was
enough
to
bring
a
painless
death
within
sixteen
hours
or
so
that
was
his
ace
in
the
hole
and
he
waited
only
for
the
best
time
to
use
it
bells
rang
the
prisoners
jumped
from
their
beds
and
went
through
a
few
minutes
of
calisthenics
other
bells
rang
and
a
tray
of
small
tins
of
appeared
out
of
a
slit
in
the
wall
by
each
bed
more
bells
rang
different
kinds
of
bells
some
deep
and
brazen
others
high
and
shrill
and
the
prisoners
marched
off
to
specialized
jobs
with
various
machines
you
slept
eight
hours
calisthenics
five
minutes
eating
ten
minutes
relaxation
to
the
tune
of
musical
bells
ten
minutes
work
period
eight
hours
repeat
that
was
all
of
life
and
after
a
while
marquis
knew
a
man
would
not
be
aware
of
time
nor
of
his
name
nor
that
he
had
once
been
human
marquis
felt
deep
lancing
pain
as
he
tried
to
resist
the
bells
each
time
the
bells
rang
and
a
prisoner
did
respond
properly
invisible
rays
of
needle
pain
punched
and
kept
punching
until
he
reacted
properly
and
finally
he
did
as
the
bells
told
him
to
do
finally
he
forgot
that
things
had
ever
been
any
other
way
marquis
sat
on
his
bed
eating
while
the
bells
of
eating
rang
across
the
bowed
heads
in
the
gray
uniforms
he
stared
at
the
girl
then
at
the
man
there
were
many
opportunities
to
take
one
own
life
here
that
had
perplexed
him
from
the
start
has
the
girl
and
this
man
succeeded
in
dying
and
all
the
others
they
were
comparatively
new
here
all
these
in
this
indoctrination
ward
why
were
they
trying
to
leave
in
the
only
dignified
way
of
escape
left
no
tried
to
talk
he
tried
hard
to
remember
things
sometimes
memory
would
break
through
and
bring
him
pictures
of
other
times
of
happenings
on
earth
of
a
girl
he
had
known
of
times
when
he
was
a
child
but
only
the
mildest
and
softest
kind
of
recollections
marquis
said
i
do
think
there
a
prisoner
here
who
does
want
to
escape
and
death
is
the
only
way
out
for
us
we
know
that
for
an
instant
no
stopped
eating
a
spoonful
of
food
concentrate
hung
suspended
between
his
mouth
and
the
shelf
then
the
food
moved
again
to
the
urging
of
the
bells
invisible
pain
needles
gouged
neck
and
he
ate
again
too
automatically
talking
between
tasteless
bites
a
man
life
at
least
is
his
own
marquis
said
they
can
take
everything
else
but
a
man
certainly
has
a
right
and
a
duty
to
take
that
life
if
by
so
doing
he
can
retain
his
integrity
as
a
human
being
suicide
no
bent
forward
he
groaned
mumbled
do
do
several
times
then
curled
forward
and
lay
on
the
floor
knotted
up
into
a
twitching
ball
the
eating
period
was
over
the
lights
went
off
bells
sounded
for
relaxation
then
the
sleep
bells
began
ringing
filling
up
the
absolute
darkness
marquis
lay
there
in
the
dark
and
he
was
afraid
he
had
the
poison
he
had
the
will
but
he
could
be
unique
in
that
respect
what
was
the
matter
with
the
others
all
right
the
devil
with
them
maybe
been
broken
too
soon
to
act
he
could
act
tomorrow
during
the
work
period
he
would
take
a
grain
of
the
poison
put
the
capsule
back
in
the
tooth
the
poison
would
work
slowly
painlessly
paralyzing
the
nervous
system
finally
the
heart
sometime
during
the
beginning
of
the
next
sleep
period
he
would
be
dead
that
would
leave
six
or
seven
hours
of
darkness
and
isolation
for
him
to
remain
dead
so
they
could
get
to
him
in
time
to
bring
him
back
he
mentioned
suicide
to
the
girl
during
the
next
work
period
she
moaned
a
little
and
curled
up
like
a
fetus
on
the
floor
after
an
hour
she
got
up
and
began
inserting
punch
cards
into
the
big
machine
again
she
avoided
marquis
marquis
looked
around
went
into
a
corner
with
his
back
to
the
room
slipped
the
capsule
out
and
let
one
of
the
tiny
almost
invisible
grains
melt
on
his
tongue
he
replaced
the
capsule
and
returned
to
the
machine
a
quiet
but
exciting
triumph
made
the
remainder
of
the
work
period
more
bearable
back
on
his
bed
he
drifted
into
sleep
into
what
he
knew
was
the
final
sleep
he
was
more
fortunate
than
the
others
within
an
hour
he
would
be
dead
somewhere
someone
was
screaming
the
sounds
rose
higher
and
higher
a
human
body
somewhere
pain
unimaginable
twisting
up
through
clouds
of
belching
steam
muscles
quivering
nerves
twitching
and
somewhere
a
body
floating
and
bobbing
and
crying
sheets
of
agony
sweeping
and
returning
in
waves
and
the
horror
of
unescapable
pain
expanding
like
a
volcano
of
madness
somewhere
was
someone
alive
who
should
be
dead
and
then
in
the
dark
in
absolute
silence
marquis
moved
a
little
he
realized
vaguely
that
the
screaming
voice
was
his
own
he
stared
into
the
steamy
darkness
and
slowly
carefully
wet
his
lips
he
moved
he
felt
his
lips
moving
and
the
whisper
sounding
loud
in
the
dark
alive
he
managed
to
struggle
up
out
of
the
bed
he
could
scarcely
remain
erect
every
muscle
in
his
body
seemed
to
quiver
he
longed
to
slip
down
into
the
darkness
and
escape
into
endless
sleep
but
he
tried
that
and
he
was
still
alive
he
did
know
how
much
time
had
passed
he
was
sure
of
the
poison
effects
but
he
was
dead
they
had
gotten
to
him
in
time
sweat
exploded
from
his
body
he
tried
to
remember
more
pain
he
lay
down
again
he
writhed
and
perspired
on
the
bed
as
his
tortured
mind
built
grotesque
fantasies
out
of
fragments
of
broken
memory
the
routine
of
the
unceasing
bells
went
on
bells
leap
up
bells
calisthenics
bells
eat
bells
march
bells
work
he
tried
to
shut
out
the
bells
he
tried
to
talk
to
covered
up
his
ears
and
would
listen
the
girl
would
listen
to
him
there
were
other
ways
and
he
kept
the
poison
hidden
in
the
capsule
in
his
hollow
tooth
he
had
been
counting
the
steps
covering
the
length
of
the
hall
then
the
twenty
steps
to
the
left
then
to
the
right
to
where
the
narrow
corridor
led
again
to
the
left
where
he
had
seen
the
after
the
bells
stopped
ringing
and
the
darkness
was
all
around
him
he
got
up
he
counted
off
the
steps
no
guards
no
alarms
nothing
to
stop
him
they
depended
on
the
conditioners
to
take
care
of
everything
this
time
he
would
do
it
this
time
they
would
bring
him
back
no
one
else
could
even
talk
with
him
about
it
even
though
he
knew
they
all
wanted
to
escape
some
part
of
them
still
wanted
to
but
they
could
so
it
was
up
to
him
he
stopped
against
the
smooth
opaque
glasite
dome
it
had
a
brittle
bright
shine
that
reflected
from
the
moon
surface
it
was
night
out
there
with
an
odd
metallic
reflection
of
earthlight
against
the
naked
crags
he
hesitated
he
could
feel
the
intense
and
terrible
cold
the
airlessness
out
there
fingering
hungrily
reaching
and
whispering
and
waiting
he
turned
the
wheel
the
door
opened
he
entered
the
and
shut
the
first
door
when
the
was
right
he
turned
the
other
wheel
and
the
outer
lock
door
swung
outward
the
air
spun
him
outward
like
a
balloon
into
the
awful
airless
cold
and
naked
silence
his
body
sank
down
into
the
thick
pumice
dust
that
drifted
up
around
him
in
a
fine
powdery
blanket
of
concealment
he
felt
no
pain
the
cold
airlessness
dissolved
around
him
in
deepening
darkening
pleasantness
this
time
he
was
dead
thoroughly
and
finally
and
gloriously
dead
even
buried
and
they
could
find
him
and
even
if
they
did
finally
find
him
what
good
would
it
do
them
some
transcendental
part
of
him
seemed
to
remain
to
observe
and
triumph
over
his
victory
this
time
he
was
dead
to
stay
this
time
he
knew
at
once
that
the
twisting
body
in
the
steaming
pain
the
distorted
face
the
screams
rising
and
rising
were
all
charles
marquis
maybe
a
dream
though
he
thought
so
much
pain
so
much
screaming
pain
is
not
real
in
some
fraction
of
a
fraction
of
that
interim
between
life
and
death
one
could
dream
of
so
much
because
dreams
are
timeless
yet
he
found
himself
anticipating
even
through
the
shredded
dissociated
nameless
kind
of
pain
a
repetition
of
that
other
time
the
awful
bitterness
of
defeat
he
opened
his
eyes
slowly
it
was
dark
the
same
darkness
he
was
on
the
same
bed
and
the
old
familiar
dark
around
and
the
familiar
soundlessness
that
was
now
heavier
than
the
most
thunderous
sound
everything
around
him
then
seemed
to
whirl
up
and
go
down
in
a
crash
he
rolled
over
to
the
floor
and
lay
there
his
hot
face
cooled
by
the
cold
metal
as
before
some
undeterminable
interim
of
time
had
passed
and
he
knew
he
was
alive
his
body
was
stiff
he
ached
there
was
a
drumming
in
his
head
and
then
a
ringing
in
his
ears
as
he
tried
to
get
up
managed
to
drag
himself
to
an
unsteady
stance
against
the
wall
he
felt
now
an
icy
surety
of
horror
that
carried
him
out
to
a
in
space
a
terrible
fatigue
hit
him
he
fell
back
onto
the
bed
he
lay
there
trying
to
figure
out
how
he
could
be
alive
he
finally
slept
pushed
into
it
by
sheer
and
utter
exhaustion
the
bells
called
him
awake
the
bells
started
him
off
again
he
tried
to
talk
again
to
they
avoided
him
all
of
them
but
they
were
really
alive
any
more
how
long
could
he
maintain
some
part
of
himself
that
he
knew
definitely
was
charles
marquis
he
began
a
ritual
a
routine
divorced
from
that
to
which
all
those
being
indoctrinated
were
subjected
it
was
a
little
private
routine
of
his
own
dying
and
then
finding
that
he
was
not
dead
he
tried
it
many
ways
he
took
more
grains
of
the
poison
but
he
was
always
alive
again
you
damn
you
talk
to
me
you
know
what
been
happening
to
me
the
man
nodded
quickly
over
his
little
canisters
of
this
indoctrination
you
the
girl
you
went
crazy
when
i
talked
about
dying
what
the
man
yelled
hoarsely
do
do
say
it
all
this
what
been
going
through
ca
you
understand
all
that
is
part
of
indoctrination
you
no
different
than
the
rest
of
us
we
all
had
it
all
of
us
all
of
us
some
more
maybe
than
others
it
had
to
end
you
have
to
give
in
oh
god
i
wish
you
did
i
wish
you
could
win
but
you
no
smarter
than
the
rest
of
us
have
to
give
in
it
was
longest
and
most
coherent
speech
maybe
i
can
get
somewhere
with
him
marquis
thought
i
can
find
out
something
but
would
say
any
more
marquis
kept
on
trying
no
one
he
knew
would
ever
realize
what
that
meant
to
keep
on
trying
to
die
when
no
one
would
let
you
when
you
kept
dying
and
then
kept
waking
up
again
and
you
were
dead
no
one
could
ever
understand
the
pain
that
went
between
the
dying
and
the
living
and
even
marquis
could
remember
it
afterward
he
only
knew
how
painful
it
had
been
and
knowing
that
made
each
attempt
a
little
harder
for
marquis
he
tried
the
poison
again
there
was
the
big
stamping
machine
that
had
crushed
him
beyond
any
semblance
of
a
human
being
but
he
had
awakened
alive
again
whole
again
there
was
the
time
he
grabbed
the
power
cable
and
felt
himself
in
one
blinding
flash
conquer
life
in
a
burst
of
flame
he
slashed
his
wrists
at
the
beginning
of
a
number
of
sleep
periods
when
he
awakened
he
was
whole
again
there
was
even
a
scar
he
suffered
the
pain
of
resisting
the
eating
bells
until
he
was
so
weak
he
could
respond
and
he
knew
that
he
died
that
time
too
from
pure
starvation
i
ca
stay
dead
you
have
to
give
in
he
did
know
when
it
was
he
had
no
idea
now
how
long
he
had
been
here
but
a
guard
appeared
a
man
who
guided
marquis
back
to
the
office
where
the
fat
little
manager
waited
for
him
behind
the
shelf
suspended
by
silver
wires
from
the
ceiling
the
manager
said
you
are
the
most
remarkable
prisoner
we
ever
had
here
there
probably
will
not
be
another
like
you
here
again
marquis
features
hung
slack
his
mouth
slightly
open
his
lower
lip
drooping
he
knew
how
he
looked
he
knew
how
near
he
was
to
cracking
completely
becoming
a
senseless
puppet
of
the
bells
why
is
that
he
whispered
you
tried
repeatedly
to
you
know
what
i
mean
of
course
you
have
kept
on
attempting
this
impossible
thing
attempted
it
more
times
than
anyone
else
here
ever
has
frankly
we
did
think
any
human
psyche
had
the
stuff
to
try
it
that
many
times
to
resist
that
long
the
manager
made
a
curious
lengthened
survey
of
marquis
face
soon
you
be
thoroughly
indoctrinated
you
are
for
all
practical
purposes
now
you
work
automatically
then
to
the
bells
and
think
very
little
about
it
at
all
except
in
a
few
stereotyped
ways
to
keep
your
brain
and
nervous
system
active
enough
to
carry
out
simple
specialized
work
duties
or
while
the
new
system
lasts
and
i
imagine
that
will
be
forever
forever
yes
yes
you
immortal
now
the
manager
smiled
surely
after
all
this
harrowing
indoctrination
experience
you
realize
i
might
have
guessed
i
might
laugh
now
but
i
ca
we
who
pretend
to
live
in
a
hell
that
is
worse
than
death
and
you
the
managerials
who
live
in
we
two
are
immortal
that
is
you
immortal
as
long
as
we
desire
you
to
be
you
never
grow
any
older
than
we
want
you
to
never
so
senile
as
to
threaten
efficiency
that
was
what
you
were
so
interested
in
finding
out
on
earth
was
it
the
mystery
behind
the
managerials
why
they
never
seemed
to
grow
old
why
we
have
all
the
advantage
no
senility
no
weakening
the
advantage
of
accumulative
experience
without
the
necessity
of
yes
marquis
whispered
the
manager
leaned
back
he
lit
a
paraette
and
let
the
soothing
seep
into
his
lungs
he
explained
every
one
of
you
political
prisoners
we
bring
here
want
above
everything
else
to
die
it
was
a
challenge
to
our
experimental
social
order
here
we
have
no
objection
to
your
killing
yourself
we
have
learned
that
even
the
will
to
die
can
be
conditioned
out
of
the
most
determined
rebel
as
it
has
been
conditioned
out
of
you
you
try
to
die
enough
times
and
you
do
die
but
the
pain
of
resurrection
is
so
great
that
finally
it
is
impossible
not
only
to
kill
yourself
but
even
to
think
of
attempting
it
marquis
could
say
anything
the
memory
called
up
by
the
mention
of
rasped
along
his
spine
like
chalk
on
a
blackboard
he
could
feel
the
of
sensation
the
threatening
bursts
of
pain
no
he
whispered
over
and
over
no
please
no
the
manager
said
we
wo
mention
it
anymore
you
never
be
able
to
try
any
overt
act
of
again
the
bright
light
from
the
ceiling
lanced
like
splinters
into
the
tender
flesh
of
marquis
eyeballs
danced
about
the
base
of
his
brain
in
reddened
choleric
circles
his
face
had
drawn
back
so
that
his
cheekbones
stood
out
and
his
nose
was
his
irises
became
a
bright
painful
blue
in
the
reddened
ovals
of
his
eyes
the
manager
yawned
as
he
finished
explaining
each
prisoner
entering
here
has
an
identification
made
of
his
unique
vibratory
field
that
the
secret
of
our
immortality
and
yours
like
all
matter
human
difference
is
in
the
vibratory
rates
we
have
these
on
file
for
every
prisoner
we
have
one
of
you
any
dead
human
body
we
merely
put
in
a
tank
which
dissolves
it
into
separate
cells
a
mass
of
stasis
with
potentiality
to
be
reformed
into
any
type
of
human
being
of
which
we
have
an
identification
you
see
this
tank
of
dissociated
cells
is
surrounded
by
an
field
induced
from
a
machine
by
one
of
the
identification
that
particular
human
being
lives
again
the
body
its
mind
its
life
pattern
identical
to
that
from
which
the
original
was
made
each
time
you
have
died
we
reduced
your
body
regardless
of
its
condition
to
dissociated
cells
in
the
tank
the
identification
was
put
in
the
machine
your
unique
field
reformed
the
cells
into
you
it
could
only
be
you
as
you
are
now
from
those
cells
we
can
resurrect
any
one
of
whom
we
have
an
identification
plate
that
is
all
no
now
that
you
indoctrinated
you
will
work
from
now
on
in
the
because
of
your
experience
for
an
undeterminable
length
of
time
he
followed
the
routines
of
the
bells
in
the
big
among
the
hydroponic
beds
and
the
canning
machines
among
the
and
little
belts
that
dropped
cans
of
into
racks
and
sent
them
off
into
the
walls
he
managed
to
talk
more
and
more
coherently
with
no
he
stopped
referring
to
suicide
but
if
anyone
had
the
idea
that
marquis
had
given
up
the
idea
of
dying
they
were
wrong
marquis
was
stubborn
somewhere
in
him
the
flame
still
burned
he
would
let
it
go
out
the
bells
could
put
it
out
the
throbbing
machines
could
put
it
out
and
now
he
had
at
last
figured
out
a
way
to
beat
the
game
during
an
eating
period
marquis
said
to
you
want
to
die
wait
a
minute
i
talking
about
something
we
can
both
talk
and
think
about
a
murder
agreement
you
understand
we
have
been
conditioned
against
killing
each
other
it
only
an
overt
act
of
selfdes
all
right
we
do
think
about
that
but
we
can
plan
a
way
to
kill
each
other
looked
up
he
stopped
eating
momentarily
he
was
interested
what
the
use
though
pain
shadowed
his
face
we
only
go
through
it
come
back
again
i
have
a
plan
the
way
i
have
it
worked
out
they
never
bring
either
one
of
us
back
that
was
exactly
true
of
them
would
have
to
come
back
marquis
hoped
that
would
catch
on
to
the
fact
that
he
would
have
to
be
resurrected
but
that
marquis
never
would
he
hoped
that
mind
was
too
foggy
and
dull
to
see
through
the
complex
plan
and
that
was
the
way
it
worked
marquis
explained
listened
and
smiled
it
was
the
first
time
marquis
had
ever
seen
a
prisoner
smile
he
left
what
remained
of
the
capsule
of
poison
where
could
get
it
during
one
of
the
next
four
eating
periods
was
to
slip
the
poison
into
marquis
food
can
marquis
would
know
what
meal
or
what
can
he
had
to
eat
the
bells
had
conditioned
him
that
much
and
not
to
eat
would
be
an
overt
act
of
he
was
conditioned
not
to
accept
death
administered
by
another
and
then
after
an
eating
period
whispered
to
him
poisoned
it
was
in
one
of
the
cans
you
just
ate
great
almost
shouted
marquis
all
right
now
i
die
by
the
end
of
the
next
work
period
that
gives
us
this
sleep
period
and
all
the
next
work
period
during
that
time
i
dispose
of
you
as
i
said
went
to
his
bed
and
the
bells
rang
and
the
dark
came
and
both
of
them
slept
number
resisted
the
conditioners
enough
to
follow
marquis
past
his
regular
work
room
into
the
as
planned
marched
on
and
stood
in
the
steaming
shadows
behind
the
hydroponic
beds
marquis
worked
for
a
while
at
the
canning
machines
at
the
big
grinding
vats
then
he
went
over
to
and
said
turn
around
now
smiled
he
turned
around
good
luck
he
said
good
luck
to
you
marquis
hit
across
the
back
of
the
neck
with
an
alloy
bar
and
killed
him
instantly
he
changed
clothes
with
the
dead
man
he
put
his
own
clothes
in
a
refuse
incinerator
quickly
he
dragged
the
body
over
and
tossed
it
into
one
of
the
vats
his
head
bobbed
up
above
the
gray
swirling
liquid
once
then
the
body
disappeared
entirely
was
ground
finely
and
mixed
with
the
other
foodstuff
within
eight
hours
the
cells
of
would
be
distributed
minutely
throughout
the
contents
of
thousands
of
cans
of
within
that
time
much
of
it
would
have
been
consumed
by
the
inmates
and
managers
at
the
end
of
that
work
period
marquis
returned
to
his
cell
he
went
past
his
own
bed
and
stopped
in
front
of
bed
the
sleep
bells
sounded
and
the
dark
came
again
this
would
be
the
final
dark
marquis
knew
this
time
he
had
beat
the
game
the
poison
would
kill
him
he
had
on
clothes
with
his
identification
number
he
was
on
bed
he
would
die
as
the
guards
would
finally
check
on
the
missing
man
in
the
but
they
would
never
find
him
they
would
find
dead
a
suicide
and
they
would
put
the
body
labeled
in
the
tank
dissolve
it
into
dissociated
cells
and
they
would
subject
those
cells
to
the
field
of
and
they
would
resurrect
not
only
have
i
managed
to
die
marquis
thought
but
i
managed
the
ultimate
suicide
there
wo
even
be
a
body
no
sign
anywhere
that
i
have
ever
been
at
all
even
my
cells
will
have
been
resurrected
as
someone
else
as
a
number
and
that
the
way
it
was
no
would
tell
new
prisoners
coming
in
sometimes
they
listened
to
him
and
seemed
interested
but
the
interest
always
died
during
indoctrination
but
no
interest
in
the
story
never
died
he
knew
that
now
he
could
never
let
himself
die
as
a
human
being
either
that
he
could
never
let
himself
become
completely
controlled
by
the
bells
he
been
nearly
dead
as
an
individual
but
no
had
saved
him
from
that
anonymity
he
could
keep
alive
and
maintain
hope
now
by
remembering
what
had
done
he
clung
to
that
memory
as
long
as
he
retained
that
memory
of
hope
of
triumph
at
least
some
part
of
him
would
keep
burning
as
something
had
kept
on
burning
within
the
heart
of
so
every
night
before
the
sleep
bells
sounded
he
would
go
over
the
whole
thing
in
minute
detail
remembering
every
word
and
gesture
the
details
of
his
appearance
he
told
the
plan
over
to
himself
every
night
and
told
everyone
about
it
who
came
in
to
the
indoctrination
ward
swimming
up
through
the
pain
of
resurrection
he
had
been
a
little
mad
at
at
first
and
then
he
had
realized
that
at
least
the
plan
had
enabled
one
man
to
beat
the
game
he
will
always
be
alive
to
me
maybe
in
a
way
he
part
of
me
nobody
knows
but
his
memory
will
live
he
succeeded
in
a
kind
of
ultimate
dying
no
trace
of
him
anywhere
but
the
memory
of
him
and
what
he
did
will
be
alive
when
the
new
system
and
the
managers
are
dead
that
spirit
will
assure
the
underground
of
victory
someday
and
meanwhile
keep
alive
he
even
knew
the
psychology
of
these
managers
and
their
system
that
they
ca
afford
to
make
an
error
he
knew
they
still
have
that
identification
of
him
that
they
would
have
one
more
plate
than
they
had
prisoners
but
he
anticipated
what
they
would
do
there
too
to
admit
there
was
one
more
identification
plate
than
there
were
prisoners
would
be
to
admit
a
gross
error
of
course
they
could
dissolve
one
of
the
other
prisoners
and
use
plate
and
resurrect
but
they
gain
nothing
there
would
still
be
an
extra
plate
you
see
so
they
destroyed
the
plate
he
knew
they
would
and
they
also
had
to
go
back
through
the
records
to
earth
through
the
security
files
there
through
the
birth
records
everything
and
they
destroyed
every
trace
every
shred
of
evidence
that
no
ever
existed
so
he
kept
the
memory
alive
and
that
kept
alive
while
the
other
prisoners
become
automatons
hearing
feeling
sensing
nothing
except
the
bells
remembering
nothing
anticipating
nothing
but
could
remember
something
magnificent
and
so
he
could
anticipate
and
that
was
hope
and
faith
he
found
that
no
one
really
believed
him
but
he
kept
on
telling
it
anyway
the
story
of
the
plan
maybe
this
number
did
exist
someone
would
say
if
there
no
record
anywhere
would
smile
in
my
head
there
where
the
record
is
know
remember
and
so
it
was
that
was
the
only
one
who
still
remembered
and
who
could
still
smile
when
sometime
after
that
no
one
in
the
prison
colony
knew
how
long
the
underground
was
victorious
and
the
managerial
system
crumbled
