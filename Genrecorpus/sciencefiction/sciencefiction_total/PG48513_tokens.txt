mcguire
had
lots
of
knowledge
but
no
wisdom
he
was
smart
but
incredibly
foolish
and
as
a
natural
consequence
tended
to
ask
questions
too
profound
for
any
philosopher
questions

who

i
been
in
ravenhurst
office
on
the
planetoid
called
raven
rest
only
twice
before
the
third
time
was
no
better
shalimar
ravenhurst
was
one
of
the
smartest
operators
in
the
belt
but
when
it
came
to
personal
relationships
he
was
utterly
incompetent
he
could
make
anyone
dislike
him
without
trying
when
i
entered
the
office
he
was
sitting
behind
his
mahogany
desk
his
eyes
focused
on
the
operation
he
was
going
through
with
a
wineglass
and
a
decanter
he
did
look
up
at
me
as
he
said
sit
down
oak
will
you
have
some
madeira
i
decided
i
might
as
well
observe
the
pleasantries
there
was
no
point
in
my
getting
nasty
until
he
did
thank
you
ravenhurst
i
will
he
kept
his
eyes
focused
on
his
work
it
is
easy
to
pour
wine
on
a
planetoid
where
the
is
measured
in
fractions
of
a
centimeter
per
second
squared
it
moves
slowly
like
ropy
molasses
but
you
have
to
be
careful
not
to
be
fooled
by
that
the
viscosity
is
just
as
low
as
ever
and
if
you
pour
it
from
any
great
height
it
will
go
scooting
right
out
of
the
glass
again
the
momentum
it
builds
up
is
enough
to
make
it
splash
right
out
again
in
a
gush
which
gets
it
all
over
the
place
besides
which
even
if
it
did
splash
it
would
take
it
so
long
to
fall
a
few
inches
that
you
die
of
thirst
waiting
for
it
ravenhurst
had
evolved
a
technique
from
long
years
of
practice
he
tilted
the
glass
and
the
bottle
toward
each
other
their
edges
touching
like
you
do
when
you
trying
to
pour
beer
without
putting
a
head
on
it
as
soon
as
the
wine
wet
the
glass
the
adhesive
forces
at
work
would
pull
more
wine
into
the
wine
glass
to
get
capillary
action
on
a
asteroid
you
do
need
a
capillary
by
any
means
the
negative
meniscus
on
the
wine
was
something
to
see
the
first
time
you
see
it
you
get
the
eerie
feeling
that
the
glass
is
spinning
and
throwing
the
wine
up
against
the
walls
by
centrifugal
force
i
took
the
glass
he
offered
me
careful
do
slosh
and
sipped
at
it
using
squirt
tubes
would
have
been
a
hell
of
a
lot
easier
and
neater
but
ravenhurst
liked
to
do
things
his
way
he
put
the
stopper
back
in
the
decanter
picked
up
his
own
glass
and
sipped
appreciatively
not
until
he
put
it
back
down
on
the
desk
again
did
he
raise
his
eyes
and
look
at
me
for
the
first
time
since
i
come
in
oak
you
have
caused
me
considerable
trouble
i
thought
we
hashed
all
that
out
ravenhurst
i
said
keeping
my
voice
level
so
had
i
but
it
appears
that
there
were
more
ramifications
to
your
action
than
we
had
at
first
supposed
his
voice
had
the
texture
of
heavy
linseed
oil
he
waited
as
if
he
expected
me
to
make
some
reply
to
that
when
i
did
he
sighed
slightly
and
went
on
i
fear
that
you
have
inadvertently
sabotaged
mcguire
you
were
commissioned
to
prevent
sabotage
oak
and
i
afraid
that
you
abrogated
your
contract
i
just
continued
to
keep
my
voice
calm
if
you
are
trying
to
get
back
the
fee
you
gave
me
we
can
always
take
it
to
court
i
do
think
you
win
oak
he
said
heavily
i
am
not
a
fool
regardless
of
what
your
own
impression
may
be
if
i
were
trying
to
get
back
that
fee
i
would
hardly
offer
to
pay
you
another
one
i
did
think
he
was
a
fool
you
do
get
into
the
managerial
business
and
climb
to
the
top
and
stay
there
unless
you
have
brains
ravenhurst
was
smart
all
right
it
was
just
that
when
it
came
to
personal
relationships
he
was
very
wise
then
stop
all
this
yak
about
an
abrogated
contract
and
get
to
the
point
i
told
him
i
shall
i
was
merely
trying
to
point
out
to
you
that
it
is
through
your
own
actions
that
i
find
myself
in
a
very
trying
position
and
that
your
sense
of
honor
and
ethics
should
induce
you
to
rectify
the
damage
my
honor
and
ethics
are
in
fine
shape
i
said
but
my
interpretation
of
the
concepts
might
not
be
quite
the
same
as
yours
get
to
the
point
he
took
another
sip
of
madeira
the
robotocists
at
viking
tell
me
that
in
order
to
prevent
any
further
ah
sabotage
by
unauthorized
persons
the
was
constructed
so
that
after
activation
the
first
man
who
addressed
orders
to
it
would
thenceforth
be
considered
its
ah
master
as
i
understand
it
the
problem
of
defining
the
term
unambiguously
to
a
robot
is
still
unsolved
the
robotocists
felt
that
it
would
be
much
easier
to
define
a
single
individual
that
would
prevent
the
issuing
of
conflicting
orders
to
a
robot
provided
the
single
individual
were
careful
in
giving
orders
himself
now
it
appears
that
oak
were
the
first
man
to
speak
to
mcguire
after
he
had
been
activated
is
that
correct
is
that
question
purely
rhetorical
i
asked
him
putting
on
my
best
expression
of
innocent
interest
or
are
you
losing
your
memory
i
had
explained
all
that
to
him
two
weeks
before
when
i
brought
mcguire
and
the
girl
here
so
that
ravenhurst
would
have
a
chance
to
cover
up
what
had
really
happened
my
sarcasm
did
faze
him
in
the
least
rhetorical
it
follows
that
you
are
the
only
man
whose
orders
mcguire
will
obey
your
robotocists
can
change
that
i
said
this
time
i
was
giving
him
my
version
of
genuine
innocence
a
man
has
to
be
a
good
actor
to
be
a
competent
double
agent
and
i
did
want
ravenhurst
to
know
that
i
knew
a
great
deal
more
about
the
problem
than
he
did
he
shook
his
head
making
his
jowls
wobble
no
they
can
not
they
realize
now
that
there
should
be
some
way
of
making
that
change
but
they
failed
to
see
that
it
would
be
necessary
only
by
completely
draining
mcguire
memory
banks
and
refilling
them
with
new
data
can
this
bias
be
eliminated
then
why
do
they
do
that
there
are
two
very
good
reasons
he
said
and
there
was
a
shade
of
anger
in
his
tone
in
the
first
place
that
sort
of
operation
takes
time
and
it
costs
money
if
we
do
that
we
might
as
well
go
ahead
and
make
the
slight
changes
in
structure
necessary
to
incorporate
some
of
the
improvements
that
the
robotocists
now
feel
are
necessary
in
other
words
they
might
as
well
go
ahead
and
build
the
which
is
precisely
the
thing
i
hired
you
to
prevent
it
seems
you
have
a
point
there
mr
ravenhurst
he
hired
me
because
things
were
shaky
at
viking
if
he
lost
too
much
more
money
on
the
mcguire
experiment
he
stood
a
good
chance
of
losing
his
position
as
manager
if
that
happened
some
of
his
other
managerial
contracts
might
be
canceled
too
things
like
that
can
begin
to
snowball
and
ravenhurst
might
find
himself
out
of
the
managerial
business
entirely
but
i
went
on
has
the
additional
wasted
time
already
cost
you
money
it
has
i
was
reluctant
to
call
you
in
again
understandably
enough
i
think
perfectly
it
mutual
he
ignored
me
i
even
considered
going
through
with
the
rebuilding
work
now
that
we
have
traced
down
the
source
of
failure
of
the
first
six
models
unfortunately
that
is
feasible
either
he
scowled
at
me
it
seems
he
went
on
that
mcguire
refuses
to
allow
his
brain
to
be
tampered
with
the
has
come
to
the
fore
he
has
refused
to
let
the
technicians
and
robotocists
enter
his
hull
and
he
has
threatened
to
take
off
and
leave
ceres
if
any
further
attempts
are
made
to
ah
disrupt
his
thinking
processes
i
ca
say
that
i
blame
him
i
said
what
do
you
want
me
to
do
go
to
ceres
and
tell
him
to
submit
like
a
good
boy
it
is
too
late
for
that
oak
viking
can
not
stand
any
more
of
that
kind
of
drain
on
its
financial
resources
i
have
been
banking
on
the
ships
to
put
viking
spacecraft
ahead
of
every
other
spacecraft
company
in
the
system
he
looked
suddenly
very
grim
and
very
determined
oak
i
am
that
the
robot
ship
is
the
answer
to
the
transportation
problems
in
the
solar
system
for
the
sake
of
every
human
being
in
the
solar
system
we
must
get
the
bugs
out
of
mcguire
good
for
general
is
good
for
i
quoted
to
myself
i
have
said
it
out
loud
but
i
was
fairly
certain
that
shalimar
ravenhurst
was
not
a
student
of
the
classics
oak
i
would
like
you
to
go
to
ceres
and
with
the
robotocists
at
viking
when
the
is
finally
built
i
want
it
to
be
the
prototype
for
a
fast
safe
functional
robot
spaceship
that
can
be
turned
out
commercially
you
can
be
of
great
service
mr
oak
in
other
words
i
got
you
over
a
barrel
i
do
deny
it
you
know
what
my
fees
are
ravenhurst
that
what
you
be
charged
i
expect
to
be
paid
weekly
if
viking
goes
broke
i
want
to
lose
more
than
a
week
pay
on
the
other
hand
if
the
is
successful
i
will
expect
a
substantial
bonus
how
much
exactly
half
of
the
cost
of
rebuilding
half
what
it
would
take
to
build
a
model
right
now
and
taking
a
chance
on
there
being
no
bugs
in
it
he
considered
that
looking
grimmer
than
ever
then
he
said
i
will
do
it
on
the
condition
that
the
bonus
be
paid
off
in
installments
one
each
six
months
for
three
years
after
the
first
successful
commercial
ship
is
built
by
viking
my
lawyer
will
nail
you
down
on
that
wording
i
said
but
it
a
deal
is
there
anything
else
no
then
i
think
i
leave
for
ceres
before
you
break
a
blood
vessel
you
continue
to
amaze
me
oak
he
said
and
the
soft
oiliness
of
his
voice
was
the
oil
of
vitriol
your
compassion
for
your
fellowman
is
a
facet
of
your
personality
that
i
had
not
seen
before
i
shall
welcome
the
opportunity
to
relax
and
allow
my
blood
pressure
to
subside
i
could
almost
see
shalimar
ravenhurst
suddenly
exploding
and
adding
his
own
touch
of
color
to
the
room
and
on
that
gladsome
thought
i
left
i
let
him
have
his
small
verbal
triumph
if
he
known
that
i
have
taken
on
the
job
for
almost
nothing
he
really
have
blown
up
ten
minutes
later
i
was
in
my
vacuum
suit
walking
across
the
glaring
rectangle
of
metal
that
was
the
landing
field
of
raven
rest
the
sun
was
near
the
zenith
in
the
black
sky
and
the
shadow
of
my
flitterboat
stood
out
like
an
inkblot
on
a
bridal
gown
i
climbed
in
started
the
engine
and
released
the
magnetic
anchor
that
held
the
little
boat
to
the
surface
of
the
planetoid
i
lifted
her
gently
worked
her
around
until
i
was
stationary
in
relation
to
the
spinning
planetoid
oriented
myself
against
the
stellar
background
and
headed
toward
the
first
blinker
beacon
on
my
way
to
ceres
for
obvious
economical
reasons
it
it
impracticable
to
use
spaceships
in
the
belt
a
flitterboat
with
a
single
gravitoinertial
engine
and
the
few
necessities
of
life
air
some
water
and
a
very
little
food
still
costs
more
than
a
automobile
does
on
earth
but
there
has
to
be
some
sort
of
individual
transportation
in
the
belt
they
ca
be
used
for
any
great
distances
because
a
man
ca
stay
in
a
vac
suit
very
long
without
getting
uncomfortable
you
have
to
hop
from
beacon
to
beacon
which
means
that
your
velocity
does
amount
to
much
since
you
spend
too
much
time
accelerating
and
decelerating
but
a
flitterboat
is
enough
to
get
around
the
neighborhood
in
and
that
all
that
needed
i
got
the
blinker
in
my
sights
eased
the
acceleration
up
to
one
gee
relaxed
to
watch
the
radar
screen
while
i
thought
over
my
coming
ordeal
with
mcguire
testing
spaceships
robotic
or
any
other
kind
is
strictly
not
my
business
the
sign
on
the
door
of
my
office
in
new
york
says
oak
confidential
i
hired
to
help
other
people
get
things
done
usually
if
someone
came
to
me
with
the
problem
of
getting
a
spaceship
i
simply
dig
up
the
best
test
pilot
in
the
business
hire
him
for
my
client
and
forget
about
everything
but
collecting
my
fee
but
i
could
have
refused
this
case
if
i
wanted
to
i
already
been
assigned
to
it
by
someone
a
lot
more
important
than
shalimar
ravenhurst
every
schoolchild
who
has
taken
a
course
in
government
organization
and
function
can
tell
you
that
the
political
survey
division
is
a
branch
of
the
system
census
bureau
of
the
un
government
and
that
its
job
is
to
evaluate
the
political
activities
of
various
all
over
the
system
illustration
and
every
one
of
those
poor
tykes
would
be
dead
wrong
the
political
survey
division
evaluate
political
activity
all
right
but
it
is
the
secret
service
of
the
un
government
the
vast
majority
of
the
system
citizens
do
even
know
the
government
has
a
secret
service
i
happen
to
know
only
because
i
an
agent
of
the
political
survey
division
the
psd
was
vitally
interested
in
the
whole
mcguire
project
robots
of
mcguire
complexity
had
been
built
before
the
robot
that
runs
the
traffic
patterns
of
the
american
eastern
seaboard
is
just
as
capable
as
mcguire
when
it
comes
to
handling
a
tremendous
number
of
variables
and
making
decisions
on
them
but
that
robot
did
have
to
be
given
orders
except
in
extreme
emergencies
keeping
a
few
million
cars
moving
and
safe
at
the
same
time
is
actually
pretty
routine
stuff
for
a
robot
and
a
traffic
robot
is
given
orders
verbally
it
is
given
any
orders
that
may
be
necessary
via
teletype
by
a
trained
programming
technician
those
orders
are
usually
in
reference
to
a
change
of
routing
due
to
repair
work
on
the
highways
or
the
like
the
robot
itself
can
take
care
of
such
emergencies
as
bad
weather
or
even
an
accident
caused
by
the
malfunctioning
of
an
individual
automobile
mcguire
was
different
in
the
first
place
he
was
mobile
he
was
in
command
of
a
spacecraft
in
a
sense
he
the
spacecraft
since
it
served
him
in
a
way
that
was
analogous
to
the
way
a
human
body
serves
the
human
mind
and
he
was
in
charge
of
millions
of
objects
with
a
top
velocity
of
a
hundred
and
fifty
miles
an
hour
he
was
in
charge
of
a
single
object
that
moved
at
velocities
of
thousands
of
miles
per
second
nor
did
he
have
a
set
unmoving
highway
as
his
path
his
paths
were
variable
and
led
through
the
emptiness
of
space
unforeseen
emergencies
can
happen
at
any
time
in
space
most
of
them
having
to
do
with
the
lives
of
passengers
a
cargo
ship
would
be
somewhat
less
susceptible
to
such
emergencies
if
there
were
no
humans
aboard
it
does
matter
much
to
a
robot
if
he
has
no
air
in
his
hull
but
with
passengers
aboard
there
may
be
times
when
it
would
be
necessary
to
give
orders
and
that
means
verbal
orders
orders
that
can
be
given
anywhere
in
the
ship
and
relayed
immediately
by
microphone
to
the
robot
brain
a
man
does
have
time
to
run
to
a
teletyper
and
type
out
orders
when
there
an
emergency
in
space
that
meant
that
mcguire
had
to
understand
english
and
since
there
has
to
be
feedback
in
communication
he
had
to
be
able
to
speak
it
as
well
and
that
made
mcguire
more
than
somewhat
difficult
to
deal
with
for
more
than
a
century
robotocists
have
been
trying
to
build
famous
three
laws
of
robotics
into
a
robot
brain
law
a
robot
shall
not
either
through
action
or
inaction
allow
harm
to
come
to
a
human
law
a
robot
shall
obey
the
orders
of
a
human
being
except
when
such
orders
conflict
with
the
first
law
a
robot
shall
strive
to
protect
its
own
existence
except
when
this
conflicts
with
the
first
or
second
nobody
has
succeeded
yet
because
nobody
has
yet
succeeded
in
defining
the
term
human
being
in
such
a
way
that
the
logical
mind
of
a
robot
can
encompass
the
concept
a
traffic
robot
is
useful
only
because
the
definition
has
been
rigidly
narrowed
down
as
far
as
a
traffic
robot
is
concerned
human
beings
are
the
automobiles
on
its
highways
woe
betide
any
poor
sap
who
tries
illegally
to
cross
a
highway
on
foot
the
only
concern
would
be
with
the
safety
of
the
automobiles
and
if
the
only
way
to
avoid
destruction
of
an
automobile
were
to
be
by
nudging
the
pedestrian
aside
with
a
fender
that
what
would
happen
and
since
its
orders
only
come
from
one
place
i
suppose
that
a
traffic
robot
thinks
that
the
guy
who
uses
that
typer
is
an
automobile
with
the
first
six
models
of
the
mcguire
ships
the
robotocists
attempted
to
build
in
the
three
laws
exactly
as
stated
and
the
first
six
went
insane
if
one
human
being
says
jump
left
and
another
says
jump
right
the
robot
is
unable
to
evaluate
which
human
being
has
given
the
more
valid
order
feed
enough
confusing
and
conflicting
data
into
a
robot
brain
and
it
can
begin
behaving
in
ways
that
in
a
human
being
would
be
called
paranoia
or
schizophrenia
or
catatonia
or
depending
on
the
symptoms
and
an
insane
robot
is
fully
as
dangerous
as
an
insane
human
being
controlling
the
same
mechanical
equipment
if
not
more
so
so
the
seventh
model
had
been
modified
the
present
mcguire
brain
was
impressed
with
slight
modifications
of
the
first
and
second
laws
if
it
is
difficult
to
define
a
human
being
it
is
much
more
difficult
to
define
a
human
being
one
in
other
words
who
can
be
relied
upon
to
give
wise
and
proper
orders
to
a
robot
who
can
be
relied
upon
not
to
drive
the
robot
insane
the
robotocists
at
viking
spacecraft
had
decided
to
take
another
tack
very
well
they
said
if
we
ca
define
all
the
members
of
a
group
we
can
certainly
define
an
individual
we
pick
one
responsible
person
and
build
mcguire
so
that
he
will
take
orders
only
from
that
person
as
it
turned
out
i
was
that
person
just
substitute
daniel
oak
for
human
being
in
the
first
and
second
laws
and
you
see
how
important
i
was
to
a
certain
spaceship
named
mcguire
when
i
finally
caught
the
beam
from
ceres
and
set
my
flitterboat
down
on
the
huge
landing
field
that
had
been
carved
from
the
of
the
asteroid
with
a
focused
sun
beam
i
was
itchy
with
my
own
perspiration
and
groggy
tired
i
do
like
riding
in
flitterboats
sitting
on
a
bucket
seat
astride
the
drive
tube
like
a
witch
on
a
broomstick
with
nothing
but
a
transite
hull
between
me
and
the
stars
all
cooped
up
in
a
vac
suit
unlike
driving
a
car
you
ca
pull
a
flitterboat
over
and
take
a
nap
you
have
to
wait
until
you
hit
the
next
beacon
station
ceres
the
biggest
rock
in
the
belt
is
a
lot
more
than
just
a
beacon
station
like
eros
and
a
few
others
it
a
city
in
its
own
right
and
except
for
the
government
reservation
viking
spacecraft
owned
ceres
lock
stock
and
mining
rights
part
of
the
reason
for
viking
troubles
was
envy
of
that
ownership
there
were
other
companies
in
the
belt
that
would
like
to
get
their
hands
on
that
plum
and
there
were
those
who
were
doing
everything
short
of
cutting
throats
to
get
it
the
psd
was
afraid
it
might
come
to
that
too
before
very
long
ceres
is
million
cubic
miles
of
but
nobody
would
cut
her
up
for
that
is
almost
exactly
as
cheap
as
dirt
on
earth
and
considering
shipping
costs
earth
soil
costs
a
great
deal
more
than
in
the
belt
but
as
an
operations
base
ceres
is
second
to
none
its
surface
gravity
averages
standard
gee
as
compared
with
earth
and
that
enough
to
give
a
slight
feeling
of
weight
without
unduly
hampering
the
body
with
too
much
load
i
weigh
just
under
six
pounds
on
ceres
and
after
i
been
there
a
while
going
back
to
earth
is
a
strain
that
takes
a
week
to
get
used
to
kids
that
are
brought
up
in
the
belt
are
forced
to
exercise
in
a
room
with
a
spin
on
it
at
least
an
hour
a
day
they
do
like
it
at
first
but
it
keeps
them
from
growing
up
with
the
strength
of
mice
and
an
adult
with
any
sense
takes
a
spin
now
and
then
too
traveling
in
a
flitterboat
will
give
you
a
pull
all
right
but
you
do
get
much
exercise
i
parked
my
flitterboat
in
the
space
that
had
been
assigned
to
me
by
landing
control
and
went
over
to
the
nearest
dome
after
i
cycled
through
and
had
shucked
my
vac
suit
i
went
into
the
inner
room
to
find
colonel
brock
waiting
for
me
have
a
good
trip
oak
he
asked
trying
to
put
a
smile
on
his
scarred
battered
face
i
got
here
alive
if
that
makes
it
a
good
flitterboat
trip
i
said
shaking
his
extended
hand
that
the
definition
of
a
good
trip
he
told
me
then
the
question
was
superfluous
seriously
what
i
need
is
a
bath
and
some
sleep
you
get
that
but
first
let
go
somewhere
where
we
can
talk
want
a
drink
i
could
use
one
i
guess
your
treat
my
treat
he
said
come
on
i
followed
him
out
and
down
a
ladder
to
a
corridor
that
led
north
by
definition
any
asteroid
spins
toward
the
east
and
all
directions
follow
from
that
regardless
of
which
way
the
axis
may
point
colonel
harrington
brock
was
dressed
in
the
union
suit
that
was
the
uniform
of
ravenhurst
security
guard
my
own
was
a
tasteful
green
but
some
of
the
other
people
in
the
public
corridor
seemed
to
go
for
more
flashiness
besides
silver
and
gold
there
were
shocking
pinks
and
violent
mauves
with
stripes
and
blazes
of
other
colors
a
crowd
wearing
might
shock
the
gentle
people
of
england
but
they
are
normal
dress
in
the
belt
you
ca
climb
into
a
vac
suit
with
bulky
clothing
on
and
if
you
did
you
hate
yourself
within
an
hour
with
a
curse
for
every
wrinkle
that
chafed
your
skin
and
in
the
belt
you
never
know
when
you
might
have
to
get
into
a
vac
suit
fast
in
a
safe
area
like
the
tunnels
inside
ceres
there
is
much
chance
of
losing
air
but
there
are
places
where
no
one
but
a
fool
would
ever
be
more
than
ten
seconds
away
from
his
vac
suit
i
read
an
article
by
a
psychologist
a
few
months
back
in
which
he
claimed
that
the
taste
for
loud
colors
in
union
suits
was
actually
due
to
modesty
he
claimed
that
the
bright
patterns
drew
attention
to
the
colors
themselves
and
away
from
the
base
the
colors
were
laid
over
the
observer
he
said
tends
to
see
the
color
and
pattern
of
the
suit
rather
than
the
body
it
clings
to
so
closely
maybe
he
right
i
would
know
not
being
a
psychologist
i
spent
summers
in
nudist
resorts
though
and
i
never
noticed
anyone
painting
themselves
with
lavender
and
chartreuse
checks
on
the
other
hand
the
people
who
go
to
nudist
resorts
are
a
group
so
are
the
people
who
go
to
the
belt
for
that
matter
but
the
type
of
screening
is
different
i
just
leave
that
problem
in
the
hands
of
the
psychologists
and
go
on
wearing
my
immodestly
quiet
union
suits
brock
pushed
open
the
metal
door
beneath
a
sign
that
said
bar
and
i
followed
him
in
we
sat
down
at
a
table
and
ordered
drinks
when
the
waiter
bustled
over
a
cop
in
uniform
supposed
to
drink
but
brock
figures
that
the
head
of
the
security
guard
ought
to
be
able
to
get
away
with
a
breach
of
his
own
rules
we
had
our
drinks
in
front
of
us
and
our
cigarettes
lit
before
brock
opened
up
with
his
troubles
oak
he
said
i
wanted
to
intercept
you
before
you
went
to
the
plant
because
i
want
you
to
know
that
there
may
be
trouble
yeah
what
kind
sometimes
it
a
pain
to
play
ignorant
thurston
outfit
is
trying
to
oust
ravenhurst
from
the
managership
of
viking
and
take
over
the
job
baedecker
metals
mining
corporation
which
is
managed
by
baedecker
himself
wants
to
force
viking
out
of
business
so
that
bm
m
can
take
over
ceres
for
processing
of
precious
metals
between
the
two
of
they
raising
all
sorts
of
minor
hell
around
here
and
it
liable
to
become
major
hell
at
any
time
and
we
ca
stand
any
hell
or
sabotage
around
this
planetoid
just
now
now
wait
a
minute
i
said
still
playing
ignorant
i
thought
pretty
well
established
that
the
of
the
mcguire
series
was
jack
ravenhurst
fault
she
was
the
one
who
was
driving
them
nuts
not
thurston
agents
perfectly
true
he
said
agreeably
we
managed
to
block
any
attempts
of
sabotage
by
other
company
agents
even
though
it
looked
as
though
we
had
for
a
while
he
chuckled
wryly
we
went
all
out
to
keep
the
mcguires
safe
and
all
the
time
the
boss
daughter
was
giving
them
the
works
then
he
looked
sharply
at
me
i
covered
that
of
course
no
one
in
the
security
guard
but
me
knows
that
jack
was
responsible
good
but
what
about
the
thurston
and
baedecker
agents
then
he
took
a
hefty
slug
of
his
drink
they
around
all
right
we
have
our
eyes
on
the
ones
we
know
but
those
outfits
are
as
sharp
as
we
are
and
they
may
have
a
few
agents
here
on
ceres
that
we
know
nothing
about
so
what
does
this
have
to
do
with
me
he
put
his
drink
on
the
table
oak
i
want
you
to
help
me
his
eyes
only
a
shade
darker
than
his
skin
looked
directly
into
my
own
i
know
it
is
part
of
your
assignment
and
you
know
i
ca
afford
to
pay
you
anything
near
what
you
worth
it
will
have
to
come
out
of
my
pocket
because
i
could
possibly
justify
it
from
operating
funds
ravenhurst
specifically
told
me
that
he
does
want
you
messing
around
with
the
espionage
and
sabotage
problem
because
he
does
like
your
methods
of
operation
and
you
going
to
go
against
his
orders
i
am
ravenhurst
is
sore
at
you
personally
because
you
showed
him
that
jack
was
responsible
for
the
mcguire
sabotage
it
an
irrational
dislike
and
i
am
not
going
to
let
it
interfere
with
my
job
i
going
to
protect
ravenhurst
interests
to
the
best
of
my
ability
and
that
means
that
i
use
the
best
of
other
people
abilities
if
i
can
i
grinned
at
him
the
last
i
heard
you
were
sore
at
me
for
blatting
it
all
over
ceres
that
jaqueline
ravenhurst
was
missing
when
she
sneaked
aboard
mcguire
he
nodded
perfunctorily
i
was
i
still
think
you
should
have
told
me
what
you
were
up
to
but
you
did
it
and
you
got
results
that
i
been
unable
to
get
i
not
going
to
let
a
momentary
pique
hang
on
as
an
irrational
dislike
i
like
to
think
i
have
more
sense
than
that
thanks
there
was
much
else
i
could
say
now
i
got
a
little
dough
put
away
it
not
much
but
i
could
offer
you
i
shook
my
head
cutting
him
off
nope
sorry
brock
for
two
reasons
in
the
first
place
there
would
be
a
conflict
of
interest
i
working
for
ravenhurst
and
if
he
does
want
me
to
work
for
you
then
it
would
be
unethical
for
me
to
take
the
job
in
the
second
place
my
fees
are
standardized
oh
i
can
allow
a
certain
amount
of
fluctuation
but
i
not
a
physician
or
a
lawyer
my
services
are
not
necessary
to
the
survival
of
the
individual
except
in
very
rare
cases
and
those
cases
are
generally
arranged
through
a
lawyer
when
it
a
charity
case
illustration
no
colonel
i
afraid
i
could
possibly
work
for
you
he
thought
that
over
for
a
long
time
finally
he
nodded
his
head
very
slowly
i
see
yeah
i
get
your
point
he
scowled
down
at
his
drink
i
said
it
would
be
a
pleasure
to
work
you
illustration
he
looked
up
quickly
how
that
well
let
look
at
it
this
way
you
ca
hire
me
because
i
already
working
for
ravenhurst
i
ca
hire
you
because
working
for
ravenhurst
but
since
we
may
need
each
other
and
since
we
both
working
for
ravenhurst
there
would
be
no
conflict
of
interest
if
we
or
to
put
it
another
way
i
ca
take
money
for
any
service
i
may
render
you
but
you
can
pay
off
in
services
am
i
coming
through
his
broad
smile
made
the
scars
on
his
face
fold
in
and
deepen
loud
and
clear
it
a
deal
i
held
up
a
hand
palm
toward
him
ah
ah
ah
there
no
involved
we
just
old
buddies
helping
each
other
this
is
for
friendship
not
business
i
scratch
your
back
you
scratch
mine
fair
fair
come
on
down
to
my
office
i
want
to
give
you
a
headful
of
facts
and
figures
will
do
let
me
finish
my
guzzle
seven
and
a
half
hours
later
the
phone
in
the
bedroom
of
the
company
apartment
that
brock
had
arranged
for
me
made
loud
musical
sounds
and
i
rolled
over
in
bed
and
slapped
at
the
switch
yeah
i
said
sleepily
you
asked
to
be
called
at
oh
eight
hundred
sir
said
a
pleasant
feminine
voice
yah
thanks
i
awake
you
welcome
sir
i
cut
off
and
blinked
the
sleep
out
of
my
eyes
i
spent
an
hour
and
a
half
in
brock
office
soaking
up
all
the
information
he
gave
me
and
giving
him
all
the
information
i
could
i
hoped
that
he
had
been
more
honest
and
straightforward
with
me
than
i
had
been
with
him
the
trouble
with
being
a
double
agent
is
that
you
frequently
have
to
play
dirty
with
someone
you
like
respect
and
trust
i
looked
at
the
watch
on
my
wrist
oh
eight
oh
six
greenwich
standard
time
the
girl
had
been
a
little
late
in
calling
but
it
did
matter
that
much
all
over
the
solar
system
except
on
earth
itself
the
clocks
read
the
same
as
they
do
in
greenwich
england
time
zones
do
mean
anything
anywhere
except
on
earth
where
the
natives
feel
that
the
sun
should
be
at
the
zenith
when
the
clock
says
twelve
an
irrational
concept
to
say
the
least
well
not
really
let
say
that
it
an
emotional
concept
a
man
feels
better
if
he
has
the
comfortable
notion
that
the
position
of
the
sun
has
something
to
do
with
the
numbers
on
the
clock
it
gives
him
a
sense
of
security
only
the
fact
that
a
man
in
the
belt
or
anywhere
else
in
the
system
for
that
matter
is
not
dependent
on
sol
for
lighting
purposes
makes
it
possible
to
establish
a
standard
time
for
everyone
oddly
enough
greenwich
standard
time
serves
an
emotional
and
religious
purpose
too
it
only
by
the
clock
that
a
jew
can
tell
when
the
sabbath
begins
it
only
by
the
clock
a
catholic
can
tell
when
to
begin
his
abstinence
on
friday
it
only
by
the
clock
that
a
moslem
can
tell
when
to
begin
and
end
the
fasts
of
ramadan
and
it
is
only
by
the
clock
that
the
various
work
shifts
can
operate
in
the
belt
on
earth
the
workday
is
standard
but
there
a
lot
more
work
to
be
done
in
the
belt
i
got
up
and
got
dressed
and
took
the
tubeway
to
viking
test
area
four
where
mcguire
was
the
ruler
of
the
roost
the
guard
at
the
main
door
took
one
look
at
my
pass
smiled
me
in
and
headed
for
his
phone
as
soon
as
i
went
inside
by
the
time
i
had
arrived
at
the
office
of
chief
engineer
sven
midguard
the
whole
staff
had
been
alerted
and
the
top
men
were
waiting
for
me
in
midguard
office
midguard
himself
met
me
in
his
outer
office
a
graying
man
in
his
sixties
still
handsome
in
the
way
but
running
a
bit
to
paunch
now
that
he
was
approaching
middle
age
oak
so
glad
to
see
you
so
glad
we
could
get
you
to
help
us
happy
to
be
of
service
i
said
yes
yes
of
course
come
along
come
on
in
and
meet
the
staff
they
uh
anxious
to
meet
you
i
have
bet
they
would
be
as
far
as
they
knew
i
was
just
the
guy
who
was
supposed
to
take
the
boss
daughter
to
school
on
luna
empowered
only
to
make
sure
she
did
get
into
trouble
and
had
accidentally
become
mcguire
lord
and
master
when
i
gone
to
take
her
off
the
ship
i
was
an
errand
boy
who
managed
to
get
control
of
a
spaceship
that
was
worth
millions
a
layman
who
was
holding
up
the
work
of
responsible
scientists
and
technicians
in
simple
words
a
jerk
in
spite
of
the
socially
acceptable
smiles
on
all
their
faces
every
one
of
them
managed
to
convey
his
or
her
opinion
of
me
by
facial
expression
alone
when
miguard
introduced
me
around
ellsworth
felder
was
short
and
slightly
like
a
santa
claus
he
was
introduced
as
the
head
of
the
viking
robotics
staff
and
he
shook
hands
firmly
when
he
said
he
was
glad
to
meet
me
irwin
brentwood
the
electronocist
was
a
slight
spare
man
with
the
body
of
a
young
boy
and
a
gentle
soft
tenor
voice
his
how
do
you
do
oak
was
almost
apologetic
and
his
small
hand
in
mine
exerted
more
pressure
than
i
expected
theodore
videnski
looked
more
like
a
wrestler
than
a
robotics
expert
he
was
as
tall
as
i
was
and
much
wider
and
heavier
and
his
expression
and
voice
conveyed
the
idea
that
he
could
have
lived
a
good
deal
longer
without
missing
my
acquaintance
vivian
devereaux
was
the
only
one
of
the
five
who
gave
the
impression
that
she
could
if
given
a
chance
begin
to
like
me
she
was
a
alert
and
very
pretty
woman
in
her
late
twenties
a
not
uncommon
type
in
the
belt
although
they
usually
do
come
as
lovely
as
that
the
red
silver
and
blue
pattern
of
her
union
suit
did
at
all
distract
my
attention
from
the
magnificently
molded
body
beneath
i
made
a
mental
note
to
write
a
letter
to
the
editor
of
a
certain
psychological
journal
i
decided
that
if
this
gal
could
think
as
good
as
she
looked
she
was
probably
one
hell
of
a
fine
mathematician
the
conference
room
was
small
cozy
and
ringed
with
couches
on
earth
they
would
have
been
called
padded
benches
and
they
would
have
been
uncomfortably
hard
but
you
do
need
innersprings
and
sponge
rubber
when
your
weight
has
dropped
by
per
cent
midguard
served
coffee
all
around
while
we
all
kept
up
a
patter
of
chatter
that
served
to
get
us
acquainted
before
we
launched
into
deep
thinking
and
heavy
conversation
well
said
midguard
when
he
finally
sat
down
now
that
oak
is
here
i
suggest
we
begin
scheduling
our
program
there
was
a
momentary
silence
then
the
boyish
brentwood
said
i
think
we
ought
to
explain
to
oak
just
what
our
problem
is
that
was
generally
agreed
on
and
for
the
next
half
hour
i
heard
another
of
information
i
already
had
i
just
tried
to
look
receptive
and
kept
my
mouth
shut
so
you
see
midguard
finally
wound
up
in
order
to
put
mcguire
through
his
paces
your
is
vitally
necessary
the
first
thing
to
do
rumbled
the
videnski
is
to
run
a
verbal
check
on
him
to
see
how
the
brain
is
functioning
his
circuits
should
be
checked
too
said
brentwood
softly
but
that
can
be
done
later
i
get
my
testing
equipment
ready
so
that
i
can
hook
it
in
immediately
after
you
get
through
with
the
verbal
check
he
looked
over
at
miss
deveraux
vivian
i
thought
perhaps
it
might
be
quicker
if
we
ran
a
few
straight
math
checks
on
him
before
the
verbal
check
she
said
it
would
take
long
and
if
there
anything
wrong
in
that
area
we
know
what
to
look
for
in
the
later
checks
would
that
be
all
right
with
you
ted
videnski
nodded
certainly
certainly
save
us
some
backtracking
maybe
nobody
asked
me
anything
i
was
just
a
tool
i
was
the
switch
that
would
turn
on
the
machine
these
people
wanted
to
play
with
that
was
all
i
could
see
a
long
boring
day
ahead
for
daniel
oak
if
anything
my
prediction
was
not
only
was
that
day
boring
but
so
were
the
next
three
in
effect
i
told
mcguire
that
he
should
let
the
nice
people
into
his
hull
and
answer
all
their
pretty
questions
after
that
there
was
nothing
much
to
do
but
stand
around
and
watch
while
the
others
worked
mostly
i
watched
brentwood
doing
his
circuit
checks
it
was
a
great
deal
more
interesting
to
watch
lights
flash
and
meter
needles
wiggle
and
lines
dancing
on
oscilloscope
plates
than
it
was
to
listen
to
conversations
that
sounded
as
if
they
been
lifted
from
dodgson
treatise
on
logic
a
man
is
marooned
on
an
asteroid
without
food
or
water
and
only
one
day
supply
of
air
in
the
tanks
of
his
vac
suit
if
there
is
an
emergency
air
tank
on
the
asteroid
it
contains
enough
air
to
last
him
for
two
weeks
if
there
is
a
flare
bomb
on
the
asteroid
then
there
is
an
air
tank
there
is
either
a
dismantled
communicator
on
the
asteroid
or
an
emergency
water
supply
but
not
both
there
is
either
an
emergency
food
package
or
flare
bomb
or
a
single
hibernine
injection
or
there
is
both
an
emergency
food
package
and
a
flare
bomb
but
no
hibernine
if
there
is
an
emergency
water
supply
it
contains
enough
water
to
last
the
man
four
days
if
there
is
a
hibernine
injection
then
there
is
a
dismantled
communicator
on
the
asteroid
if
there
is
an
emergency
food
package
there
is
enough
in
it
to
last
him
for
one
day
and
there
is
a
dismantled
communicator
but
if
they
are
not
both
there
then
neither
is
there
if
there
is
emergency
air
tank
then
there
is
an
emergency
water
supply
if
there
is
a
flare
bomb
he
can
set
it
off
immediately
and
rescue
will
arrive
within
two
days
if
there
is
a
dismantled
communicator
it
will
take
the
man
one
day
to
put
it
together
before
he
can
call
for
help
and
rescue
will
arrive
in
an
additional
two
days
if
there
is
an
emergency
water
tank
there
is
either
a
single
hibernine
injection
or
a
food
package
or
both
if
there
is
a
hibernine
injection
the
man
can
use
it
to
put
himself
into
suspended
animation
for
exactly
hours
during
which
time
he
will
need
neither
air
nor
food
nor
water
if
there
is
air
or
water
or
food
on
the
asteroid
or
any
two
of
them
or
all
three
the
man
will
use
each
at
the
normal
rate
until
it
is
exhausted
or
the
man
dies
or
he
is
rescued
assuming
that
without
hibernine
the
man
can
live
for
exactly
two
days
without
water
exactly
one
week
without
food
and
exactly
five
minutes
without
air
can
he
be
rescued
if
so
how
long
will
it
be
before
he
is
rescued
if
not
what
is
his
maximum
survival
time
does
this
problem
have
more
than
one
valid
answer
if
so
give
and
explain
both
or
is
the
problem
unsolvable
as
given
if
so
explain
why
it
is
unsolvable
sit
around
listening
to
that
sort
of
stuff
for
very
long
and
you
begin
to
wish
you
out
on
an
uninhabited
asteroid
somewhere
problems
like
that
are
the
sort
of
thing
that
any
computer
can
solve
in
a
fraction
of
a
second
if
they
reduced
to
binary
notation
first
but
poor
mcguire
had
to
do
his
own
mathematical
interpretations
from
english
and
the
things
got
more
complicated
as
they
went
along
and
mcguire
went
right
on
answering
them
in
his
calm
baritone
i
remember
that
particular
problem
because
while
videnski
was
reciting
it
brentwood
pointed
at
an
oscilloscope
plate
that
had
nothing
on
it
but
a
wide
bright
flickering
band
of
light
that
wavered
a
little
around
the
upper
and
lower
edges
see
that
he
asked
in
his
tenor
voice
that
a
tracing
of
thinking
processes
actually
it
a
very
thin
very
bright
tracing
but
it
moving
over
that
area
so
fast
that
you
ca
see
it
a
camera
could
pick
it
up
and
if
the
film
were
projected
at
normal
speed
you
could
see
every
little
bit
of
data
being
processed
then
he
patted
a
small
instrument
that
was
sitting
near
the
oscilloscope
plate
of
course
we
do
go
to
all
that
trouble
we
record
it
directly
and
analyze
it
later
and
that
analysis
can
be
pretty
maddening
at
times
said
a
very
lovely
voice
behind
me
i
turned
around
and
gave
vivian
deveraux
my
best
smile
her
blond
hair
looked
a
little
disheveled
but
it
did
make
her
any
the
less
beautiful
what
does
videnski
say
i
asked
is
mcguire
still
passing
his
exams
she
smiled
ted
says
that
if
this
keeps
up
we
can
get
mcguire
a
scholarship
at
cal
tech
then
she
frowned
slightly
it
all
depends
on
the
analysis
of
course
we
have
to
see
how
his
timing
is
and
how
many
actual
computations
he
using
for
each
problem
it
take
a
lot
of
work
i
could
hear
videnski
voice
still
droning
away
in
the
control
room
alternating
with
an
occasional
answer
from
mcguire
normally
mcguire
only
used
the
speaker
in
whatever
compartment
i
happened
to
be
in
but
i
given
him
orders
to
stick
with
videnski
during
the
testing
also
had
him
shut
off
his
in
the
control
room
so
that
our
chatter
would
be
going
into
his
brain
along
with
videnski
in
the
lounge
where
we
were
brentwood
had
removed
a
panel
that
gave
him
access
to
the
testing
circuits
to
actually
get
into
inner
workings
and
tamper
with
him
would
be
a
lot
tougher
mcguire
would
allow
it
unless
i
told
him
to
but
even
if
he
did
getting
to
the
brain
required
three
separate
keys
and
the
knowledge
of
the
combination
on
the
dial
of
the
durasteel
door
to
the
tank
that
held
his
brain
explosives
would
wreck
the
brain
if
they
were
powerful
enough
to
open
the
door
and
so
would
a
torch
viking
spacecraft
had
taken
every
precaution
to
make
sure
that
nobody
stole
their
pet
how
long
before
we
can
give
mcguire
his
test
flight
i
asked
mcguire
had
been
into
space
once
but
it
had
been
a
shakedown
cruise
vivian
looked
at
brentwood
tomorrow
unless
something
unforeseen
shows
up
huh
irwin
that
what
the
schedule
says
murmured
brentwood
great
i
said
just
great
there
schedule
and
no
one
told
me
anything
about
it
anything
else
i
should
know
about
perhaps
some
little
thing
like
where
we
going
or
whether
i
should
pack
a
bag
or
whether
i
even
invited
along
vivian
devereaux
blinked
it
was
a
very
pretty
blink
oh
my
goodness
i
sorry
i
guess
we
have
kept
you
very
much
in
touch
really
have
we
we
so
used
to
working
together
that
she
let
the
words
trail
off
with
a
sheepish
smile
brentwood
chuckled
a
soft
chuckle
i
thought
the
chief
had
told
you
by
the
chief
he
meant
ellsworth
felder
the
head
robotocist
as
far
as
these
people
were
concerned
sven
midguard
was
just
a
spacecraft
engineer
not
a
word
i
said
mentally
making
a
note
to
find
out
why
santa
claus
felder
had
failed
to
notify
me
well
bring
a
suitcase
vivian
said
we
or
rather
you
are
taking
mcguire
on
a
test
hop
to
phobos
mars
is
pretty
close
right
now
so
it
be
an
easy
drive
sunwards
if
all
goes
well
you
to
set
him
down
at
syrtisport
for
his
first
planet
landing
then
to
luna
for
a
day
or
two
then
directly
to
earth
and
long
island
spaceport
we
should
know
by
then
how
he
behaves
why
earth
i
asked
there
did
seem
much
point
to
it
keep
it
under
your
hat
she
said
manager
ravenhurst
is
planning
a
big
publicity
campaign
first
ship
to
make
the
voyage
without
a
human
hand
at
the
controls
and
all
that
i
do
know
why
but
he
wants
to
make
a
big
splash
on
earth
if
mcguire
has
checked
out
perfectly
as
far
as
luna
oh
well
ravenhurst
the
boss
i
knew
why
the
general
public
did
know
how
shaky
viking
spacecraft
was
and
neither
presumably
did
the
robotics
staff
that
knowledge
was
strictly
managerial
level
but
a
big
splash
on
earth
would
boost
viking
prestige
tremendously
with
a
possible
rise
in
stock
values
which
would
take
some
of
the
shakiness
out
of
viking
by
the
time
the
day
work
was
over
i
heard
all
of
rumbling
baritone
that
i
wanted
to
hear
i
was
grateful
to
get
back
to
the
relative
silence
of
my
apartment
i
opened
a
beer
lit
a
cigarette
and
relaxed
on
my
bed
for
a
few
minutes
before
i
made
a
phone
call
i
punched
banning
and
got
an
answer
almost
immediately
the
screen
did
come
to
life
but
a
voice
said
marty
here
hullo
oak
he
could
see
me
even
if
i
could
see
him
if
anyone
punched
that
number
by
accident
marty
would
simply
turn
on
a
recording
that
said
the
number
you
have
punched
is
not
a
working
number
please
disconnect
and
punch
again
this
is
a
recorded
message
there
is
no
point
in
letting
just
anyone
get
in
touch
with
the
ceres
branch
of
the
political
survey
division
through
their
secret
channels
marty
i
said
the
test
hop
is
tomorrow
i
gave
him
all
the
details
as
i
knew
them
he
sounded
thoughtful
if
either
thurston
or
baedecker
agents
are
going
to
try
anything
it
seems
as
though
this
would
be
the
time
to
do
it
i
think
so
too
do
you
have
any
new
information
at
all
not
much
thurston
men
do
know
what
baedecker
is
up
to
as
far
as
we
can
gather
but
the
baedecker
agents
have
an
idea
that
thurston
is
trying
to
take
over
viking
and
they
do
mind
at
all
evidently
hoping
that
the
battle
will
create
enough
confusion
so
that
it
wo
take
much
push
on
their
part
to
topple
the
whole
mess
and
take
control
we
know
most
of
the
regular
agents
on
both
sides
and
we
managed
to
get
a
lot
of
that
information
to
colonel
brock
so
that
he
can
handle
quite
a
bit
of
the
work
for
us
marty
chuckled
a
little
that
what
i
call
a
secret
agent
brock
has
no
idea
that
he
an
agent
for
a
service
he
does
even
know
exists
harrington
brock
is
a
good
man
marty
do
underestimate
him
i
do
it
a
shame
he
just
does
have
quite
what
it
takes
to
be
good
psd
material
i
hate
to
be
referred
to
as
good
or
bad
do
you
have
any
idea
how
baedecker
or
thurston
might
be
going
to
pull
the
play
not
a
one
so
far
how
about
that
robotics
team
or
the
engineers
who
are
working
on
the
ship
think
any
of
them
could
be
in
the
pay
of
a
rival
it
possible
i
said
but
i
do
know
which
one
or
ones
it
might
be
i
been
watching
them
for
three
days
and
they
all
seem
on
the
to
me
and
that
worries
me
how
so
you
think
that
at
least
one
of
them
would
behave
suspiciously
by
accident
once
in
a
while
you
know
nerves
or
jumpiness
from
purely
personal
reasons
maybe
or
woman
trouble
but
no
the
clue
of
the
dog
in
the
night
huh
does
that
mean
you
suspect
all
of
them
he
asked
dryly
sure
is
that
what
a
good
detective
is
supposed
to
do
i
would
know
i
just
an
information
post
i
will
say
this
though
if
any
of
that
bunch
is
connected
with
either
baedecker
or
thurston
he
is
a
professional
he
someone
who
been
contacted
secretly
and
offered
a
heavy
bribe
we
checking
back
on
all
of
them
now
to
see
if
there
anything
in
their
pasts
which
might
indicate
that
their
ethics
are
not
what
they
should
be
or
any
unusual
circumstance
that
might
indicate
blackmail
or
financial
pressure
nothing
so
far
though
nothing
i
thought
for
a
second
then
said
is
there
any
known
rival
agent
in
any
position
to
sabotage
mcguire
on
phobos
mars
or
luna
several
in
each
place
but
we
have
agents
there
to
keep
an
eye
on
them
to
be
honest
with
you
oak
i
do
think
there
much
to
worry
about
i
do
mean
you
should
keep
your
eyes
open
but
i
know
what
you
mean
i
said
do
my
own
worrying
and
do
worry
you
with
it
all
right
meanwhile
if
you
get
anything
i
can
use
call
me
and
i
let
you
know
at
this
end
fair
enough
good
luck
i
wished
him
the
same
and
cut
off
i
had
time
for
one
drag
off
my
cigarette
and
one
swallow
of
beer
before
the
phone
chimed
i
put
my
beer
down
and
pushed
the
switch
for
the
audio
only
yes
i
said
the
face
that
came
on
the
screen
was
one
i
never
seen
before
a
man
about
my
age
i
thought
or
maybe
a
few
years
older
his
skin
was
tanned
whether
by
heredity
or
sunlight
was
hard
to
tell
his
features
were
not
distinctive
enough
to
be
sure
his
hair
was
medium
brown
and
cut
rather
longer
than
the
crew
cut
which
is
common
in
the
belt
i
calling
for
daniel
oak
he
said
in
a
low
tenor
voice
i
touched
the
vision
button
and
let
the
transmit
my
image
to
him
no
point
in
playing
cagy
just
at
that
time
speaking
i
said
you
daniel
oak
of
new
york
he
asked
that
right
the
confidential
expediter
he
seemed
to
want
to
make
very
certain
of
his
quarry
that
right
i
repeated
his
smile
was
a
little
stiff
my
name
is
venuccio
oak
andré
venuccio
i
like
to
speak
to
you
about
a
matter
of
employment
you
mean
you
want
a
job
this
is
a
conversational
gimmick
known
as
the
deliberate
misunderstanding
or
the
innocent
needle
he
twitched
his
head
a
little
which
might
have
been
a
negative
shake
no
no
wish
to
employ
mr
oak
well
i
pretty
busy
right
now
and
i
he
cut
me
off
with
oak
i
have
come
all
the
way
from
earth
to
speak
to
you
i
assure
you
that
this
is
most
important
i
would
like
very
much
to
discuss
it
with
you
well
all
right
go
ahead
not
over
the
phone
there
is
a
possibility
of
its
being
tapped
i
would
like
to
meet
you
personally
i
took
a
couple
of
seconds
out
for
thought
there
are
a
lot
of
places
on
earth
where
a
phone
line
can
be
tapped
with
fairly
cheap
equipment
simply
because
for
economic
reasons
the
phone
company
has
installed
new
equipment
but
on
ceres
everything
goes
through
a
synchronized
random
scrambler
circuit
just
as
it
does
in
the
more
modern
cities
on
earth
nobody
been
able
to
crack
it
yet
without
a
computer
and
a
lot
of
luck
still
very
well
venuccio
if
you
could
be
here
in
half
an
hour
no
no
he
said
quickly
your
apartment
might
be
bugged
he
had
a
point
there
he
could
know
that
i
already
made
sure
that
my
apartment
was
a
broadcaster
is
much
use
inside
ceres
the
metal
walls
stop
almost
any
radiation
before
it
can
get
very
far
if
my
place
was
bugged
conductors
of
some
kind
would
have
to
be
used
and
i
gone
over
the
place
thoroughly
to
make
sure
there
was
no
such
thing
in
addition
i
used
one
of
my
favorite
gadgets
a
noise
generator
because
a
conversation
is
patterned
it
is
possible
to
pick
it
out
of
a
white
purely
random
background
noise
even
if
the
background
is
louder
than
the
conversation
but
my
little
sweetheart
was
a
multiple
recording
of
ten
thousand
different
conversations
all
meaningless
a
lot
of
white
noise
after
the
gadget
is
connected
up
the
walls
vibrate
with
jabber
that
ca
be
analyzed
even
by
the
best
of
differential
analyzers
only
in
the
hush
area
away
from
the
walls
is
it
quiet
illustration
with
a
hunch
something
wrong
is
it
does
tell
what
wrong
but
my
caller
could
be
expected
to
know
that
and
i
did
feel
like
telling
him
i
decided
to
see
how
far
he
go
venuccio
i
said
in
an
apologetic
tone
i
sorry
but
my
present
work
will
require
several
more
weeks
and
i
understand
that
he
said
quickly
he
seemed
to
be
a
great
one
for
interruptions
but
i
assure
you
that
i
can
make
it
worth
your
while
what
would
you
charge
for
an
hour
of
your
time
it
would
depend
on
what
i
have
to
do
all
you
will
have
to
do
is
listen
to
me
explain
my
problem
and
my
proposition
to
you
an
hour
at
the
very
most
i
could
meet
you
at
the
in
half
an
hour
this
is
very
urgent
mr
oak
not
to
me
it
was
but
my
intuition
told
me
that
there
was
something
here
i
ought
to
know
about
all
right
venuccio
i
be
there
it
cost
you
a
hundred
in
cash
for
the
consultation
fee
have
it
with
you
in
case
he
did
know
what
i
charged
that
ought
to
give
him
some
idea
he
did
flinch
very
good
oak
i
see
you
in
half
an
hour
then
and
his
image
vanished
i
thought
there
was
something
definitely
phony
about
andré
venuccio
his
manner
of
speaking
did
sound
natural
it
was
as
though
he
were
attempting
to
pretend
to
be
something
he
was
i
made
a
few
phone
calls
and
came
up
with
more
information
the
last
ship
directly
from
earth
had
landed
four
days
ago
venuccio
could
have
come
in
by
flitterboat
but
it
did
seem
likely
if
he
had
as
he
claimed
come
all
the
way
from
earth
to
see
me
aside
from
the
fact
that
my
staff
in
my
new
york
office
would
have
told
him
where
i
was
there
was
also
the
fact
that
no
andré
venuccio
had
come
in
on
the
last
ship
i
made
two
more
calls
one
to
marty
and
one
to
colonel
brock
and
then
began
to
get
ready
for
my
appointment
with
the
enigmatic
venuccio
the
is
one
of
the
most
elaborate
dining
clubs
on
ceres
it
caters
strictly
to
the
moneyed
class
and
is
positively
drenched
in
snob
appeal
the
food
is
good
the
liquor
is
good
and
the
entertainment
is
adequate
since
all
three
have
to
be
imported
from
earth
the
first
two
are
expensive
and
the
last
one
is
the
best
they
can
get
because
most
of
the
entertainers
of
earth
feel
that
it
worth
their
while
to
go
it
is
one
of
the
few
public
places
in
the
belt
where
you
will
be
expected
to
dress
for
dinner
that
means
a
jacket
and
bermuda
shorts
over
your
union
suit
as
far
as
decoration
goes
the
is
the
lushest
place
in
the
belt
the
walls
of
the
main
dining
room
which
is
about
sixty
by
sixty
feet
in
floor
area
are
paneled
with
white
oak
up
to
a
height
of
eight
feet
wood
is
expensive
in
the
belt
forests
on
the
asteroids
share
the
null
class
with
snowflakes
on
the
sunward
side
of
mercury
above
the
paneling
the
ceiling
is
domed
and
black
and
a
pattern
of
bright
pinlights
representing
the
pleiades
greatly
enlarged
glitters
against
the
blackness
the
floor
is
decorative
traction
tile
white
and
pale
blue
with
geometric
designs
on
it
in
the
middle
of
the
floor
there
is
a
hollow
transparent
column
brightly
illuminated
from
below
four
feet
in
diameter
it
rises
a
dozen
feet
above
the
floor
to
a
flat
truncated
top
that
is
opaque
to
prevent
the
light
from
hitting
the
dome
overhead
and
ruining
the
effect
and
mirrored
on
the
underside
to
reflect
the
light
back
down
the
column
inside
thousands
of
tiny
faceted
plastic
gems
are
kept
constantly
in
motion
by
forced
air
currents
swirling
up
and
down
the
inside
of
the
transparent
column
easy
enough
to
do
under
cerean
gravity
each
spinning
gem
scarcely
larger
than
a
pinhead
catches
the
light
and
scatters
it
around
the
room
it
a
sort
of
macroscopic
tyndall
effect
that
is
quite
impressive
i
told
the
headwaiter
that
i
wanted
venuccio
table
and
was
escorted
straight
to
it
venuccio
was
waiting
for
me
he
stood
up
as
i
approached
and
gave
me
his
stiff
smile
he
was
short
not
more
than
five
foot
six
and
rather
lean
i
got
the
impression
that
his
jacket
was
padded
to
make
his
shoulders
appear
wider
than
they
were
sit
down
oak
he
said
in
that
oddly
forced
voice
of
his
would
you
care
for
something
to
eat
or
a
drink
perhaps
he
already
had
a
drink
still
full
not
just
yet
later
maybe
i
had
watched
him
as
he
stood
up
and
i
went
right
on
watching
him
while
we
sat
down
for
a
man
who
was
just
in
from
earth
he
handled
himself
remarkably
well
under
low
gee
we
may
order
later
he
said
to
the
waiter
as
soon
as
the
waiter
was
out
of
earshot
venuccio
leaned
toward
me
and
suddenly
he
was
all
business
one
hand
slid
a
banknote
across
the
table
here
is
the
hundred
we
agreed
upon
oak
i
can
state
my
proposition
very
quickly
you
have
only
to
listen
i
palmed
the
hundred
and
slipped
it
out
of
sight
you
have
rented
yourself
a
pair
of
ears
mr
venuccio
very
good
he
kept
his
voice
low
and
even
do
you
know
anything
of
the
cronos
water
corporation
sure
cronos
is
one
of
the
companies
that
mines
the
rings
of
saturn
a
lot
of
the
water
here
in
the
belt
comes
from
the
ice
they
ship
in
why
not
exactly
he
said
ignoring
my
question
they
now
have
full
control
of
their
only
rival
titan
enterprises
i
am
a
stockholder
in
titan
and
i
am
convinced
that
there
was
chicanery
involved
in
the
transfer
of
managership
the
cronos
corporation
intends
to
raise
the
price
of
water
in
the
belt
and
make
a
lot
of
fast
money
does
the
government
know
about
this
no
even
i
ca
prove
it
on
paper
that
why
i
want
you
to
go
out
there
and
get
the
information
it
will
have
to
be
done
quickly
before
cronos
can
file
notice
of
new
prices
what
do
you
mean
you
have
to
take
the
which
is
leaving
for
luna
this
evening
in
order
to
catch
the
which
is
leaving
luna
for
saturn
there
wo
be
another
chance
for
three
weeks
and
that
will
be
too
late
it
was
all
very
pretty
saturn
was
on
the
other
side
of
the
system
at
the
time
and
it
would
be
a
nice
long
trip
i
shook
my
head
sorry
venuccio
but
as
i
told
you
i
already
engaged
you
have
to
get
someone
else
he
looked
suddenly
desperate
i
will
pay
you
well
i
buy
out
your
present
contract
and
i
pay
you
double
for
the
work
we
spent
the
rest
of
his
hour
haggling
or
rather
haggled
i
asked
a
lot
of
questions
and
he
tried
to
answer
them
in
order
to
convince
me
that
i
should
go
and
i
just
asked
more
questions
exactly
one
hour
from
the
time
i
been
handed
the
hundred
i
stood
up
venuccio
was
in
the
middle
of
a
sentence
but
i
said
your
hour
up
venuccio
the
answer
is
still
no
thank
you
for
your
business
but
he
started
to
rise
started
to
grasp
my
sleeve
sit
down
i
did
say
it
harshly
or
angrily
just
firmly
he
sat
i
do
want
to
be
bothered
by
any
more
of
this
kind
of
thing
ever
again
is
that
understood
mr
venuccio
he
nodded
wordlessly
and
i
left
him
sitting
there
as
i
moved
toward
the
door
the
headwaiter
came
towards
me
before
he
could
say
anything
i
said
venuccio
is
taking
care
of
the
check
i
know
that
oak
he
said
in
a
low
voice
we
have
him
tailed
when
he
leaves
here
i
never
would
have
recognized
him
it
was
colonel
harrington
brock
wearing
a
plexiskin
mask
got
any
idea
of
what
he
wants
or
who
he
working
for
he
wants
me
to
leave
ceres
which
would
hold
up
the
testing
of
mcguire
offered
me
plenty
for
it
too
i
pretty
sure
he
wearing
a
plexiskin
mask
too
and
i
almost
certain
i
heard
that
voice
before
but
i
ca
quite
place
it
we
find
out
brock
said
grimly
then
he
gave
me
a
headwaiter
smile
and
went
on
his
way
i
went
on
out
through
the
ornate
doors
of
the
when
i
got
back
to
my
apartment
i
looked
it
over
carefully
it
look
as
though
anyone
had
made
an
unauthorized
search
i
called
marty
and
he
assured
me
that
the
men
watching
the
place
had
seen
no
one
go
in
but
i
was
already
fairly
certain
that
the
purpose
of
appointment
had
not
been
to
lure
me
away
from
my
apartment
he
wanted
me
to
go
a
lot
farther
than
that
i
drank
a
couple
more
beers
and
smoked
four
or
five
cigarettes
while
i
thought
things
through
then
i
got
ready
for
bed
cut
the
lights
and
went
to
sleep
the
next
morning
i
showed
up
at
viking
testing
area
four
with
a
hot
breakfast
inside
me
and
my
vac
suit
outside
ready
to
go
with
mcguire
mcguire
tall
blue
spire
shone
brightly
in
the
sunlight
and
looked
as
he
always
did
as
though
ready
to
take
the
leap
at
any
time
there
would
be
only
five
of
us
aboard
besides
myself
there
was
the
short
chubby
ellsworth
felder
head
of
the
robotics
staff
the
boyish
irwin
brentwood
the
tough
taciturn
theodore
videnski
and
the
lovely
vivian
devereaux
we
made
the
checks
to
make
sure
everything
was
ready
for
the
hop
to
phobos
and
then
i
took
command
plot
a
orbit
to
phobos
mcguire
in
five
minutes
yes
sir
said
mcguire
he
thought
for
a
minute
then
said
course
plotted
sir
good
i
glanced
at
brentwood
who
had
set
up
his
instruments
in
a
semipermanent
installation
for
the
trip
did
you
get
that
brentwood
he
nodded
all
right
mcguire
we
going
to
be
doing
a
few
tests
out
in
space
so
for
right
now
just
follow
the
curve
of
the
first
half
up
to
five
minutes
before
turnover
i
let
you
know
what
to
do
then
warn
me
at
five
minutes
before
turnover
otherwise
just
keep
going
until
i
give
you
further
orders
yes
sir
how
much
longer
until
time
three
and
a
half
minutes
sir
begin
a
countdown
at
minus
thirty
seconds
one
count
every
five
seconds
until
minus
five
seconds
one
count
per
second
from
there
to
zero
lift
at
zero
yes
sir
we
got
everything
settled
made
sure
there
were
no
loose
tools
lying
around
and
sat
down
in
the
lounge
chairs
to
wait
for
the
lift
pretty
soon
mcguire
said
minus
thirty
seconds
finally
he
said
five
four
three
two
one
zero
and
we
all
sank
down
in
the
chairs
under
the
pull
of
a
full
standard
gee
of
acceleration
one
thousand
centimeters
per
second
squared
ceres
fell
away
from
beneath
us
and
slowly
receded
in
the
vast
blackness
of
space
i
got
up
and
stretched
my
muscles
and
the
others
began
doing
the
same
it
takes
time
to
get
used
to
a
full
gee
again
after
spending
time
in
the
belt
even
in
a
flitterboat
you
in
a
bucket
seat
lying
on
your
back
you
ca
do
any
walking
around
in
a
flitterboat
the
change
in
ellsworth
felder
was
remarkable
all
that
chubbiness
that
had
ballooned
out
under
the
low
gravity
of
ceres
and
made
him
look
like
the
cheerful
cherub
was
pulled
into
sagging
folds
under
the
pull
of
the
ship
acceleration
it
made
him
look
fifteen
years
older
none
of
the
others
seemed
to
be
bothered
much
felder
kept
his
good
humor
though
he
did
seem
to
know
that
been
any
change
in
his
appearance
he
rubbed
his
hands
together
and
said
i
for
one
always
get
hungry
when
the
gravity
goes
up
may
i
suggest
an
early
lunch
nobody
disagreed
with
him
we
settled
into
a
routine
pretty
quickly
there
was
much
to
do
since
mcguire
was
taking
care
of
the
jobs
that
require
a
crew
on
an
ordinary
ship
to
avoid
boredom
we
brought
books
and
a
few
decks
of
cards
and
various
other
several
times
mcguire
had
to
change
course
slightly
because
of
rocks
in
his
path
and
brentwood
would
always
glance
at
his
instruments
when
that
happened
watching
the
squiggles
that
indicated
mcguire
replotting
illustration
those
occasional
rocks
were
our
reason
for
waiting
before
we
tried
any
fancy
tricks
with
mcguire
we
wanted
to
get
out
into
the
relatively
clear
space
between
mars
and
the
belt
i
beat
videnski
out
of
a
at
gin
rummy
which
oddly
enough
seemed
to
raise
his
respect
for
me
vivian
deveraux
talked
with
brentwood
for
a
while
then
settled
down
to
reading
a
book
entitled
some
applications
of
discontinuity
in
pattern
theory
felder
munched
apples
and
read
a
magazine
we
ate
another
meal
amid
pleasant
chatter
and
i
went
into
one
of
the
two
bedrooms
for
a
nap
miss
devereaux
had
one
of
the
bedrooms
all
to
herself
we
men
had
drawn
straws
and
felder
and
i
had
ended
up
with
the
bedroom
while
videnski
and
brentwood
got
the
couches
in
the
lounge
i
dozed
off
but
it
was
only
a
light
doze
if
there
were
an
emergency
i
would
be
the
only
one
who
could
order
mcguire
around
and
i
wanted
to
be
ready
to
wake
up
at
a
moment
notice
i
been
snoozing
for
half
an
hour
or
so
when
i
heard
the
noise
that
woke
me
up
i
been
lying
with
my
face
to
the
wall
and
for
a
moment
i
could
figure
out
what
had
awakened
me
then
i
heard
it
again
just
the
faintest
sound
of
a
footstep
near
the
bunk
i
moved
just
in
time
i
sat
up
and
turned
to
see
irwin
brentwood
standing
near
me
holding
a
hypospray
gun
in
one
hand
i
jumped
him
knocking
the
gun
aside
but
his
hand
did
lose
his
grip
on
it
as
we
went
down
in
a
tangle
he
was
a
lot
tougher
than
he
looked
that
boyish
figure
was
all
wiry
muscle
and
i
was
still
dopey
from
sleep
not
much
but
just
enough
to
impair
my
efficiency
i
got
a
grip
on
his
gun
hand
and
began
slowly
twisting
it
while
we
rolled
over
and
over
on
the
floor
then
somehow
he
managed
to
get
his
other
arm
loose
and
he
drove
an
elbow
into
my
throat
there
was
an
instant
of
blinding
pain
and
i
heard
the
hypogun
go
as
my
muscles
tightened
with
the
searing
fire
in
my
throat
the
next
thing
i
knew
somebody
was
wiping
my
face
with
a
cold
wet
towel
i
opened
my
eyes
it
was
vivian
deveraux
i
tried
to
say
something
but
nothing
came
out
there
was
only
a
terrible
aching
in
my
throat
videnski
was
standing
near
a
chair
where
brentwood
was
seated
brentwood
looked
a
little
dazed
videnski
looked
furious
so
did
felder
who
was
looking
at
the
hypospray
gun
he
was
holding
in
his
hand
who
hired
you
brentwood
he
asked
sharply
there
was
nothing
santa
clausy
about
him
now
a
man
named
borodin
brentwood
said
in
an
uninterested
voice
i
managed
to
force
air
past
my
bruised
larynx
all
that
came
out
was
a
whisper
what
happened
he
tried
to
use
pythantin
on
you
felding
said
but
he
got
the
dose
himself
that
why
he
i
nodded
and
stopped
when
a
pain
went
through
my
throat
pythantin
would
have
made
me
receptive
to
any
suggestions
brentwood
wanted
to
make
what
were
you
supposed
to
do
after
you
dosed
daniel
oak
felder
asked
the
electronicist
tell
him
to
order
mcguire
to
change
course
to
go
to
asteroid
i
sat
up
it
was
nice
just
to
lie
there
and
have
vivian
bathe
my
brow
but
i
had
more
pressing
things
to
do
i
did
feel
in
the
pink
of
condition
and
my
throat
hurt
like
hell
but
i
was
in
too
bad
a
shape
this
borodin
i
whispered
who
was
he
working
for
i
do
know
brentwood
said
he
did
say
we
questioned
him
for
another
half
hour
but
it
soon
became
apparent
that
he
did
know
very
much
he
been
offered
a
tremendous
amount
of
money
to
do
the
job
and
he
did
have
the
stamina
to
refuse
it
guys
like
brentwood
who
gave
rise
to
the
saying
that
every
man
has
his
price
what
we
do
now
felding
asked
at
last
go
on
to
phobos
or
go
back
to
ceres
back
to
ceres
i
whispered
colonel
brock
will
know
what
to
do
with
him
i
been
uneasy
ever
since
my
calls
to
brock
and
marty
that
morning
had
disclosed
that
venuccio
had
lost
the
men
who
were
supposed
to
be
tailing
him
it
fairly
easy
to
do
on
ceres
if
you
know
how
it
wo
mean
much
of
a
delay
i
went
on
ravenhurst
can
still
have
his
big
splash
on
earth
we
herded
brentwood
into
the
lounge
and
bound
him
to
a
chair
then
i
said
mcguire
yes
sir
we
changing
course
return
to
ceres
and
mcguire
said
i
sorry
sir
i
can
not
obey
any
orders
except
those
of
daniel
oak
i
just
stood
there
for
a
long
minute
i
am
daniel
oak
i
whispered
but
i
was
fairly
certain
that
the
declaration
would
do
me
no
good
whatever
i
was
right
no
sir
you
are
not
mr
oak
mcguire
is
always
polite
to
anyone
who
speaks
to
him
even
if
he
does
regard
that
person
as
human
mcguire
i
said
patiently
can
you
see
oak
is
he
on
board
yes
sir
i
perceive
him
seated
on
the
starboard
couch
in
the
main
lounge
fine
then
your
directional
audio
should
be
able
to
tell
you
where
this
voice
is
coming
from
yes
sir
it
is
coming
from
the
approximate
volume
of
space
now
occupied
by
oak
head
but
it
is
definitely
not
oak
voice
felder
put
a
hand
over
his
eyes
and
moaned
videnski
who
had
carefully
lighted
a
cigarette
blew
out
a
cloud
of
smoke
and
looked
at
me
i
got
to
admit
he
right
that
is
not
daniel
oak
voice
which
came
first
the
chicken
or
the
egg
vivian
said
abstractedly
what
that
got
to
do
with
it
videnski
asked
with
a
scowl
a
matter
of
definition
vivian
said
somewhere
along
the
line
of
chicken
evolution
it
would
have
been
possible
to
point
at
a
specific
bird
and
say
is
a
chicken
but
its
parents
were
not
chickens
now
do
you
define
a
chicken
egg
as
an
egg
laid
by
a
chicken
or
an
egg
that
hatches
out
a
chicken
that
right
felder
said
do
you
define
oak
voice
as
any
voice
coming
from
oak
or
as
any
voice
that
sounds
like
oak
well
you
people
ought
to
be
able
to
answer
that
i
said
which
is
it
both
said
felder
in
a
dull
voice
when
you
activated
him
by
giving
him
his
first
order
he
identified
you
and
the
voice
as
parts
of
the
same
unit
if
you
gone
hoarse
slowly
as
it
were
mcguire
could
have
made
logical
adjustments
to
the
change
but
this
sudden
change
is
too
big
a
jump
for
his
logic
to
follow
he
has
got
the
intermediate
steps
he
needs
to
put
it
into
syllogistic
form
there
was
another
question
i
wanted
to
ask
of
mcguire
mcguire
you
are
not
supposed
to
allow
oak
to
come
to
any
harm
yet
you
did
so
why
i
was
wondering
how
he
managed
to
let
brentwood
get
away
with
his
attack
on
me
without
at
least
warning
me
oak
was
in
no
danger
sir
he
has
come
to
no
harm
what
about
brentwood
attack
brentwood
did
not
attack
oak
sir
oak
attacked
mr
brentwood
the
other
three
looked
at
me
in
a
way
he
right
i
said
quickly
when
i
saw
brentwood
standing
there
with
the
hypospray
i
jumped
him
that
another
one
of
our
problems
said
felder
how
do
you
define
if
you
broke
your
arm
and
a
doctor
tried
to
set
it
without
an
anesthetic
what
would
mcguire
think
when
you
yelled
could
you
and
i
engage
in
a
friendly
boxing
match
and
since
mcguire
is
supposed
to
harm
he
has
to
be
able
to
define
it
in
advance
oh
had
a
lot
of
fun
with
that
one
i
tell
you
there
was
a
thin
edge
of
bitterness
in
his
voice
you
see
what
this
means
do
you
videnski
asked
eying
me
through
a
cloud
of
blue
cigarette
smoke
sure
i
whispered
it
means
that
mcguire
will
go
right
on
accelerating
until
i
tell
him
to
stop
and
i
ca
tell
him
that
until
my
larynx
heals
if
it
ever
does
if
it
takes
a
week
or
two
which
is
likely
vivian
said
we
be
saying
to
the
solar
system
by
the
time
this
heals
i
said
we
be
so
far
out
we
wo
be
able
to
come
back
at
that
distance
the
amount
of
sunlight
mcguire
will
be
able
to
pick
up
will
be
negligible
and
the
atomic
fuel
will
be
gone
nobody
bothered
to
suggest
that
we
call
for
help
mcguire
had
the
communications
system
under
control
too
one
of
us
i
said
had
better
think
of
something
in
the
next
several
hours
every
one
of
us
thought
of
something
one
way
or
another
not
that
it
did
much
good
because
none
of
the
ideas
were
worth
much
directly
indirectly
they
told
us
plenty
about
what
to
try
when
brentwood
finally
came
out
from
under
the
effects
of
the
pythantin
even
he
started
thinking
furiously
about
some
way
out
of
our
predicament
we
kept
him
locked
in
the
bedroom
for
obvious
reasons
but
he
had
just
as
much
stake
in
getting
us
back
in
control
of
mcguire
as
we
did
after
all
there
no
law
against
industrial
espionage
and
we
could
prove
any
charge
of
sabotage
even
a
charge
of
attempted
kidnapping
or
attempted
larceny
would
be
almost
impossible
to
make
stand
up
in
court
with
a
good
lawyer
he
could
get
out
from
under
an
assault
and
battery
charge
he
lose
his
job
with
viking
of
course
but
that
was
better
than
losing
his
life
his
failure
to
deliver
mcguire
to
baedecker
metals
mining
might
lose
him
some
of
the
money
he
been
promised
but
he
was
prepared
for
that
too
i
knew
he
was
a
baedecker
agent
even
if
he
did
because
i
knew
who
borodin
worked
for
meanwhile
five
brains
were
trying
frantically
to
think
of
some
way
of
convincing
mcguire
that
he
should
obey
my
orders
first
i
tried
reasoning
with
him
mcguire
do
you
understand
what
it
is
that
generates
the
human
voice
yes
sir
a
flow
of
slightly
compressed
air
from
the
lungs
causes
vibration
of
the
vocal
cords
and
this
sound
is
modified
by
the
lips
tongue
and
teeth
very
well
now
you
see
oak
do
you
not
yes
sir
and
you
see
that
this
voice
is
being
generated
by
mr
oak
i
can
not
tell
that
sir
i
have
no
way
of
sensing
the
operation
of
oak
vocal
equipment
but
you
can
tell
that
this
voice
is
coming
from
mr
oak
yes
sir
then
it
must
be
oak
voice
that
does
not
coincide
with
the
facts
sir
therefore
the
logic
is
faulty
a
comparison
of
the
present
voice
with
the
voice
of
oak
shows
too
few
points
of
similarity
for
identification
you
wo
get
anywhere
that
way
felder
said
wearily
none
of
the
data
you
give
him
verbally
is
used
in
his
final
computations
since
it
does
come
from
daniel
oak
by
his
own
reasoning
that
is
correct
sir
said
mcguire
idiot
machine
said
vivian
deveraux
angrily
i
shut
up
and
did
some
more
thinking
talking
only
made
my
throat
hurt
nobody
could
argue
impressively
with
mcguire
except
daniel
oak
and
as
far
as
mcguire
was
concerned
oak
was
keeping
an
impressive
silence
maybe
i
could
write
out
the
orders
i
said
nope
said
videnski
he
can
read
but
information
coming
in
that
way
is
counted
as
orders
not
even
from
you
we
should
have
installed
a
teletyper
too
but
this
is
a
little
late
for
thinking
of
that
mcguire
i
whispered
what
sort
of
proof
would
be
needed
to
show
you
that
this
is
the
voice
of
daniel
oak
i
sorry
sir
mcguire
said
after
a
moment
but
that
information
is
not
in
my
banks
maybe
somebody
could
imitate
dan
voice
vivian
said
hopefully
videnski
and
felder
shook
their
heads
in
unison
no
dice
videnski
said
rumblingly
it
not
only
has
to
sound
like
oak
it
has
to
come
from
oak
ventriloquism
vivian
said
with
a
grin
would
fool
mcguire
for
an
instant
felder
said
that
an
trick
of
the
human
mind
not
of
a
robot
the
ship
kept
on
moving
mcguire
went
serenely
on
following
his
last
orders
we
finally
reached
the
point
where
we
were
too
tired
to
think
and
sleep
became
imperative
we
were
nearly
two
days
out
of
ceres
when
i
announced
my
intention
of
taking
a
snooze
felder
looked
at
me
through
groggy
bloodshot
eyes
had
we
better
sleep
in
two
shifts
i
mean
just
in
case
there
another
spy
among
us
i
shook
my
head
no
spy
would
try
anything
now
there
is
anything
to
try
we
all
safe
as
far
as
that
concerned
i
go
in
and
sleep
in
my
assigned
room
not
even
brentwood
could
or
would
do
anything
to
me
now
for
that
matter
felder
said
it
senseless
to
keep
him
locked
up
now
he
harmless
until
we
reestablish
control
over
mcguire
when
that
happens
we
can
lock
him
up
again
my
sentiments
exactly
i
said
in
my
new
hoarse
breathy
susurrant
voice
brentwood
did
say
much
when
i
gave
him
the
news
he
just
thanked
me
i
got
into
bed
and
worried
for
a
while
but
lack
of
sleep
soon
cut
off
my
ability
to
worry
i
only
woke
up
once
in
the
next
nine
hours
when
mcguire
changed
course
a
trifle
to
avoid
some
unseen
meteor
not
even
the
ache
in
my
throat
kept
me
from
sleep
it
was
videnski
voice
that
woke
me
up
the
door
of
my
room
was
slid
open
a
little
and
i
could
hear
him
in
the
lounge
i
got
to
my
feet
fast
shoved
open
the
door
and
went
out
videnski
had
grabbed
brentwood
by
the
front
of
his
union
suit
and
had
lifted
him
off
his
feet
and
slammed
his
back
up
against
the
wall
his
free
hand
was
swinging
back
and
forth
in
slaps
that
looked
as
though
any
one
of
them
should
have
torn
the
smaller
man
head
off
felder
was
ineffectually
trying
to
pull
videnski
away
from
brentwood
but
the
big
man
did
even
seem
to
notice
it
vivian
devereaux
was
nowhere
in
sight
videnski
harsh
baritone
was
filled
with
invective
that
should
have
made
the
air
as
glowingly
blue
as
the
inside
of
an
rectifier
tube
i
ran
across
the
room
grabbed
videnski
by
the
shoulder
and
said
stop
that
he
stopped
when
i
throw
out
an
emotional
field
like
that
only
a
very
exceptional
man
can
disobey
let
him
go
i
said
videnski
released
him
and
brentwood
slid
down
the
wall
just
this
side
of
unconsciousness
what
the
idea
i
asked
i
i
sorry
videnski
rumbled
lost
my
temper
i
guess
that
i
mean
he
stopped
fumbling
for
words
i
know
i
heard
what
you
were
saying
sure
it
his
fault
my
voice
sounds
the
way
it
does
sure
he
a
spy
and
probably
a
saboteur
and
if
we
die
he
be
morally
guilty
of
manslaughter
suicide
remember
but
slapping
him
around
like
that
is
going
to
do
any
of
us
any
good
and
we
need
all
the
thinking
we
can
get
if
we
intend
to
pull
ourselves
out
of
this
mess
so
leave
him
alone
videnski
hear
my
whispery
voice
did
sound
very
authoritative
but
a
crisp
firm
commanding
baritone
does
not
authority
make
any
more
than
iron
bars
a
cage
yeah
he
said
apologetically
i
sorry
oak
i
sort
of
lost
my
head
it
wo
happen
again
i
knelt
down
and
took
a
look
at
brentwood
he
was
actually
damaged
much
but
his
face
was
going
to
be
swollen
and
bruised
somehow
i
could
feel
very
sorry
for
him
i
got
him
to
his
feet
come
on
brentwood
let
go
lie
down
for
a
while
you
feel
better
yeah
he
mumbled
through
thickening
lips
thanks
i
got
him
into
his
bunk
closed
the
door
on
him
and
came
back
to
the
lounge
anybody
dream
up
any
solutions
in
his
sleep
i
asked
it
was
apparent
that
they
had
maybe
vivian
has
felder
said
she
still
asleep
let
not
bank
on
it
i
said
oh
i
did
have
one
idea
felder
said
dispiritedly
ted
here
and
i
were
working
on
it
when
brentwood
came
out
when
it
did
pan
out
well
that
when
the
fight
started
what
was
your
idea
i
asked
mcguire
if
he
realized
what
would
happen
to
oak
if
he
just
kept
going
he
said
he
did
that
if
he
ran
out
of
fuel
be
marooned
and
would
die
so
he
figured
out
a
nice
complicated
orbit
that
will
allow
him
to
obey
your
last
order
until
the
very
last
possible
moment
he
land
us
on
titan
at
the
very
last
moment
the
trouble
is
we
forgot
to
tell
him
how
much
food
we
have
aboard
and
he
made
the
assumption
that
there
plenty
for
everybody
for
an
indefinite
length
of
time
but
we
going
to
be
plenty
hungry
by
the
time
we
get
there
can
you
last
twelve
days
without
food
i
do
want
to
try
it
and
of
course
it
would
do
any
good
for
you
to
tell
him
that
we
have
enough
food
how
about
letting
him
take
a
look
at
the
food
supply
he
does
know
how
much
is
necessary
and
he
would
only
have
our
word
for
it
that
there
was
no
more
aboard
one
thing
i
can
tell
you
if
we
ever
get
back
to
rebuild
mcguire
one
of
the
things
he
going
to
have
is
a
lot
more
sensory
devices
so
that
he
can
judge
more
facts
on
his
own
hook
agreed
said
another
voice
right
now
we
dealing
with
a
idiot
vivian
devereaux
had
stepped
out
of
her
room
and
had
been
listening
to
felder
explain
what
he
tried
sleep
had
done
her
as
much
good
as
it
might
have
under
other
circumstances
the
strain
was
showing
on
her
face
illustration
a
club
or
a
hammer
is
the
best
way
to
get
sense
into
a
situation
breakfast
was
a
affair
brentwood
stayed
in
his
room
though
he
accepted
the
cup
of
coffee
i
brought
him
the
rest
of
us
did
eat
much
more
than
that
i
was
trying
to
think
our
way
out
of
the
fix
and
so
were
the
others
something
some
sort
of
an
idea
had
been
sitting
quietly
at
the
bottom
of
my
mind
just
barely
discernible
through
the
semipermeable
barrier
that
separates
the
conscious
from
the
subconscious
but
i
could
fish
it
out
when
i
managed
to
grasp
part
of
it
i
said
look
the
trouble
is
that
mcguire
is
incapable
of
connecting
my
present
voice
with
the
voice
used
to
then
it
seems
to
me
that
our
job
is
to
supply
him
with
the
missing
steps
how
asked
felder
one
of
you
or
all
of
you
if
it
took
that
to
convince
him
could
fake
a
hoarse
whispery
voice
you
could
slowly
make
your
voice
worse
and
worse
so
that
he
could
see
the
steps
involved
vivian
brightened
but
felder
and
videnski
shook
their
heads
together
like
the
bobbsey
twins
sorrowing
over
a
lost
pet
what
we
may
do
voluntarily
said
felder
over
a
relatively
long
period
of
time
has
nothing
to
do
with
what
happened
to
you
suddenly
and
involuntarily
you
see
in
the
long
run
he
really
does
about
our
voices
he
does
pay
any
attention
to
us
really
except
as
incidental
cargo
he
has
no
concept
of
intelligence
actually
he
accept
any
statements
of
ours
unless
they
verifiable
by
mcguire
himself
well
we
could
at
least
try
it
said
vivian
we
did
and
felder
was
right
mcguire
seemed
almost
condescending
in
his
sorrow
for
our
inability
to
see
that
there
was
no
connection
between
their
whispers
and
the
voice
of
his
lord
and
master
daniel
oak
vivian
who
had
been
standing
near
videnski
while
we
were
talking
to
mcguire
suddenly
blew
up
when
mcguire
assured
us
that
our
whispering
was
a
waste
of
time
she
grasped
her
book
some
applications
of
discontinuity
in
pattern
theory
and
threw
it
at
the
wall
speaker
from
which
mcguire
voice
came
it
bounced
harmless
off
the
protective
grill
and
fell
to
the
floor
vivian
devereaux
burst
into
tears
i
put
my
arm
around
her
gave
videnski
and
felder
the
high
sign
to
keep
thinking
and
led
her
to
her
room
as
soon
as
i
got
her
settled
i
said
relax
no
matter
what
happens
we
get
out
of
it
alive
if
we
stretch
our
rations
we
be
able
to
make
it
to
titan
without
being
more
than
underweight
and
hungry
it
not
that
she
said
tearfully
it
the
delay
all
that
time
off
the
schedule
but
i
thought
that
was
what
you
wanted
i
said
gently
not
any
more
i
she
stopped
suddenly
and
looked
up
at
me
her
eyes
widening
what
are
you
talking
about
her
voice
was
as
whispery
as
mine
it
was
the
insistence
on
meeting
me
at
the
that
gave
you
away
i
said
dyeing
your
hair
and
combing
it
straight
back
and
putting
on
that
plexiskin
mask
and
the
contact
lenses
none
of
that
helped
conceal
that
lush
figure
of
yours
it
ca
be
done
under
a
union
suit
so
you
had
to
put
on
jacket
and
shorts
and
that
meant
you
had
to
meet
me
in
some
plush
restaurant
like
the
or
you
look
out
of
place
i
knew
all
that
talk
about
being
afraid
of
being
overheard
was
just
that
talk
a
directional
beam
microphone
could
have
picked
up
every
word
at
our
table
what
made
you
change
your
mind
about
delaying
the
work
on
mcguire
i
know
they
go
that
far
in
trying
to
stop
the
work
and
piracy
she
took
a
deep
breath
and
forced
herself
to
stop
sobbing
i
guess
they
did
trust
me
anyway
otherwise
they
would
have
put
brentwood
on
the
same
job
without
telling
me
she
did
know
that
brentwood
was
working
for
baedecker
rather
than
for
the
thurston
group
how
could
she
the
difference
lay
in
their
tactics
thurston
wanted
to
take
over
viking
as
a
going
concern
a
little
under
the
weather
perhaps
but
still
functioning
that
meant
that
they
wanted
the
work
on
mcguire
delayed
and
complicated
but
they
did
want
to
put
him
out
of
the
picture
completely
since
they
expected
to
take
over
the
work
as
soon
as
they
got
control
of
viking
baedecker
on
the
other
hand
did
give
a
care
about
viking
spacecraft
they
wanted
to
take
over
ceres
for
their
own
firm
if
that
meant
that
getting
rid
of
mcguire
completely
would
give
them
what
they
wanted
then
they
get
rid
of
mcguire
why
you
take
the
job
i
asked
money
i
sick
of
the
belt
i
want
to
go
back
home
to
earth
her
eyes
were
quite
dry
by
now
and
there
was
a
choked
sort
of
fear
in
them
i
hate
it
out
here
there
death
all
around
you
all
the
time
sometimes
it
just
outside
your
skin
on
the
other
side
of
the
fabric
of
your
vac
suit
i
wanted
to
get
back
home
but
all
the
money
is
out
here
in
the
belt
back
there
it
all
eaten
up
in
taxes
and
welfare
and
nobody
has
a
chance
to
get
a
job
that
really
pays
so
when
they
offered
me
the
money
she
stopped
and
closed
her
eyes
i
scared
that
all
i
been
scared
ever
since
i
came
out
here
and
now
she
shuddered
and
now
we
at
the
mercy
of
this
idiot
machine
i
get
so
scared
that
i
get
mad
every
time
i
hear
his
voice
if
somebody
had
set
a
thermonuclear
bomb
off
inside
my
skull
there
could
have
been
more
sudden
illumination
i
patted
her
on
the
shoulder
you
may
get
your
money
and
more
besides
i
said
she
shook
her
head
i
would
take
their
money
now
i
stood
up
i
think
i
can
talk
you
into
changing
your
mind
but
right
now
i
think
i
have
a
way
of
getting
mcguire
to
listen
to
me
thanks
to
you
she
looked
up
at
me
what
did
i
do
you
threw
a
book
i
said
that
enough
to
win
you
a
pardon
as
far
as
i
concerned
you
sit
tight
and
do
let
on
that
i
know
anything
nobody
else
knows
anything
at
all
not
even
brentwood
so
keep
quiet
she
dried
her
face
quickly
and
stood
up
too
all
right
whatever
you
say
as
we
went
back
out
into
the
lounge
i
felt
a
little
pleased
with
myself
if
things
worked
out
right
and
they
would
we
now
had
a
double
agent
inside
thurston
organization
it
would
take
too
long
to
clear
things
up
and
miss
devereaux
could
go
back
to
earth
with
a
nice
piece
of
change
in
her
pocket
what
are
you
looking
so
happy
about
videnski
asked
suspiciously
when
he
saw
us
i
show
you
i
said
where
the
tool
kit
ten
minutes
later
i
had
the
wall
speaker
in
the
lounge
out
of
its
housing
but
still
connected
mcguire
had
interfered
with
the
work
as
he
might
have
if
someone
else
had
tried
to
do
it
because
he
could
see
perfectly
well
that
it
was
daniel
oak
who
was
doing
the
job
even
though
oak
had
been
speaking
to
him
much
lately
then
i
said
mcguire
can
you
hear
me
yes
sir
i
can
hear
you
came
his
voice
from
the
speaker
can
you
hear
your
own
voice
yes
sir
very
well
now
are
you
watching
what
oak
is
doing
yes
sir
i
picked
up
a
small
hammer
and
hit
the
speaker
not
too
gently
at
just
the
right
place
did
you
see
that
mcguire
i
asked
yes
sir
i
saw
it
his
voice
sounded
hoarse
muffled
and
whispery
coming
through
the
damaged
speaker
do
you
see
what
sudden
damage
can
do
to
speaking
apparatus
i
must
test
mcguire
said
an
almost
hesitant
note
in
his
new
voice
he
spent
fifteen
seconds
or
so
saying
a
series
of
nonsense
syllables
that
are
used
as
a
test
for
a
robot
speaking
apparatus
they
contain
every
sound
used
in
english
when
that
was
over
he
said
the
damage
inflicted
has
radically
changed
the
basic
patterns
of
the
voice
if
an
equivalent
amount
of
damage
was
done
to
oak
vocal
apparatus
then
the
voice
which
has
been
speaking
must
belong
to
mr
oak
you
saw
the
damage
being
done
in
each
case
i
said
quickly
you
also
see
that
it
is
the
source
of
the
voice
that
becomes
important
when
the
pattern
has
changed
yes
oak
i
see
that
i
breathed
a
deep
heartfelt
sigh
of
relief
felder
looked
at
me
in
a
sort
of
numb
awe
how
did
you
figure
that
out
it
came
to
me
in
a
flash
but
the
clues
were
all
over
the
place
mcguire
did
stay
on
the
course
i
gave
him
he
could
if
he
wanted
to
avoid
meteors
and
then
too
you
said
that
he
ought
to
have
more
sensory
apparatus
so
that
he
could
judge
facts
the
facts
that
come
into
his
brain
from
his
own
sensory
apparatus
to
be
utilized
in
his
memory
banks
he
did
have
to
know
all
the
steps
in
reasoning
that
would
lead
from
one
voice
pattern
to
another
if
it
could
be
demonstrated
as
a
as
an
axiom
if
you
like
if
tell
him
that
he
must
change
course
he
is
obliged
to
pay
any
attention
but
if
he
spots
a
meteor
he
has
to
accept
that
as
a
fact
and
he
changes
course
to
allow
for
it
in
a
sense
then
the
meteor
is
capable
of
giving
mcguire
orders
and
you
are
felder
did
look
any
too
happy
no
one
likes
to
have
a
point
in
his
own
field
explained
to
him
by
a
layman
but
he
could
argue
with
me
there
a
great
deal
more
to
be
done
before
mcguire
can
be
put
into
practical
service
he
said
heavily
we
may
as
well
head
back
to
ceres
i
do
think
so
i
said
mcguire
in
good
enough
shape
to
let
us
make
the
big
splash
on
earth
that
ravenhurst
wants
to
make
need
it
if
viking
is
to
have
enough
financial
leeway
to
go
on
with
this
project
what
about
what
about
brentwood
vivian
devereaux
asked
we
can
get
rid
of
him
at
phobos
just
as
easily
as
we
can
at
ceres
if
there
any
explaining
of
any
kind
to
do
we
can
lay
the
blame
on
him
he
wo
be
in
any
position
to
deny
it
she
nodded
understanding
exactly
what
i
meant
there
were
still
plenty
of
bugs
to
be
worked
out
of
mcguire
but
now
i
could
see
our
way
clear
to
getting
both
thurston
and
baedecker
off
our
backs
for
a
while
at
that
point
brentwood
stuck
his
head
in
the
door
what
going
on
he
asked
in
his
soft
voice
we
going
on
to
phobos
brentwood
i
said
go
on
back
to
your
room
and
stay
there
he
withdrew
his
head
i
looked
at
videnski
go
lock
him
in
ted
he
gives
me
a
pain
in
the
neck
i
got
the
first
laugh
i
heard
in
hours
