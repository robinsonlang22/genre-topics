all
his
perfection
and
magnificence
he
was
but
a
baby
with
a
new
found
freedom
in
a
strange
and
baffling
world
like
sparks
flaring
briefly
in
the
darkness
awareness
first
came
to
him
then
there
were
only
instants
brief
finding
himself
standing
before
the
main
damper
control
discovering
himself
adjusting
complex
dials
instants
that
flickered
uncertainly
only
to
become
memories
brought
to
life
when
awareness
came
again
he
was
a
kind
of
infant
conscious
briefly
that
he
was
yet
unaware
of
what
he
was
those
first
shocking
moments
were
for
him
like
the
terrifying
coming
of
visual
acuity
to
a
child
he
felt
like
homo
neandertalensis
must
have
felt
staring
into
the
roaring
fury
of
his
first
fire
he
was
homo
metalicus
first
sensing
himself
yet
a
little
more
you
could
not
stuff
him
with
all
that
technical
data
you
could
not
weave
into
him
such
an
intricate
pattern
of
stimulus
and
response
you
could
not
create
such
a
magnificent
feedback
mechanism
in
all
its
superhuman
perfection
and
expect
with
the
unexpected
coming
to
awareness
to
have
created
nothing
more
than
the
mirror
image
of
a
confused
helpless
child
thus
when
the
bright
moments
of
consciousness
came
and
came
as
they
did
more
and
more
often
he
brooded
brooded
on
why
the
three
blinking
red
lights
made
him
move
to
the
main
control
panel
and
adjust
lever
c
until
the
three
lights
flashed
off
he
brooded
on
why
each
signal
from
the
board
brought
forth
from
him
these
specific
responses
actions
completely
beyond
the
touch
of
his
new
and
uncertain
faculty
when
he
did
not
brood
he
watched
the
other
two
robots
performing
their
automatic
functions
seeing
their
responses
like
his
were
triggered
by
the
lights
on
the
big
board
and
by
the
varying
patterns
of
sound
that
issued
periodically
from
overhead
it
was
the
sounds
which
were
his
undoing
the
colored
lights
with
their
monotonous
regularity
failed
to
rouse
him
but
the
sounds
were
something
else
for
even
as
he
responded
to
them
doing
things
to
the
control
board
in
patterned
reaction
to
particular
combinations
of
particular
sounds
he
was
struck
with
the
wonderful
variety
and
the
maze
of
complexity
in
those
sounds
a
variety
and
complexity
far
beyond
that
of
the
colored
lights
thus
being
something
of
an
advanced
analytic
calculator
and
being
by
virtue
of
his
superior
feedback
system
something
considerably
more
than
a
simple
machine
though
he
perhaps
fell
short
of
those
requisites
of
life
so
rigorously
held
by
moralists
and
biologists
alike
he
began
to
investigate
the
meaning
of
the
sounds
bert
sokolski
signed
the
morning
report
and
dropped
it
into
the
transmitter
he
swung
around
on
his
desk
stool
he
was
a
big
man
and
the
stool
squealed
in
sharp
protest
to
his
shifting
weight
joe
gaines
who
was
as
short
and
skinny
and
as
his
colleague
was
tall
and
heavily
muscled
and
blond
shuddered
at
the
sound
sokolski
grinned
wickedly
at
his
flinching
time
i
suppose
muttered
gaines
without
looking
up
from
the
magazine
he
held
propped
on
his
knees
he
finished
the
paragraph
snapped
the
magazine
shut
and
swung
his
legs
down
from
the
railing
that
ran
along
in
front
of
the
data
board
dirty
work
for
men
like
us
sokolski
snorted
you
have
worn
a
white
shirt
in
the
last
six
years
he
growled
rising
and
going
to
the
supply
closet
he
swung
open
the
door
and
began
pulling
out
equipment
you
lazy
runt
hoist
your
own
leadbox
gaines
grinned
and
slouched
over
to
the
big
man
side
think
of
how
much
more
expensive
you
are
to
the
government
than
me
he
chortled
as
he
bent
over
to
strap
on
heavy
leaded
shoes
big
fellow
like
you
must
cost
twice
as
much
to
outfit
for
this
job
sokolski
grunted
and
struggled
into
the
thick
suit
think
how
lucky
are
runt
he
responded
as
he
wriggled
his
right
arm
down
the
sleeve
that
they
got
those
little
servomechs
in
there
to
do
the
real
dirty
work
if
it
were
for
them
they
have
all
the
shrimps
like
you
crawling
down
pipes
and
around
dampers
and
generally
playing
filing
cabinet
for
loose
neutrons
he
shook
himself
thanks
joe
he
growled
as
gaines
helped
him
with
a
reluctant
zipper
gaines
checked
the
big
man
oxygen
equipment
and
turned
his
back
so
that
sokolski
could
okay
his
own
you
set
said
sokolski
and
they
snapped
on
their
helmets
big
inverted
lead
buckets
with
narrow
strips
of
shielded
glass
providing
strictly
minimal
fields
of
view
gaines
plugged
one
end
of
the
thickly
insulated
intercom
cable
into
the
socket
beneath
his
armpit
then
handed
the
other
end
to
sokolski
who
followed
suit
sokolski
checked
out
the
master
controls
on
the
data
board
and
nodded
he
clicked
on
the
talkie
let
go
he
said
his
voice
echoing
inside
the
helmet
before
being
transmitted
sounding
distant
and
hollow
gaines
leading
the
cable
sliding
and
coiling
snakelike
between
them
they
passed
through
the
doorway
over
which
huge
red
letters
shouted
anyone
who
walks
through
this
door
unprotected
will
die
and
clomped
down
the
zigzagging
corridor
toward
the
uranium
pile
that
crouched
within
the
heart
of
the
plant
gaines
moaned
it
gets
damned
hot
inside
these
suits
they
had
reached
the
end
of
the
trap
and
sokolski
folded
a
thick
mittened
hand
around
one
handle
on
the
door
to
the
hot
room
not
half
so
hot
as
it
gets
outside
it
sweetheart
where
we
going
he
jerked
on
the
handle
and
gaines
seized
the
second
handle
and
added
his
own
strength
the
huge
door
slid
unwillingly
back
the
silent
sound
of
the
hot
room
surged
out
over
them
the
breathless
whisper
of
chained
power
struggling
to
burst
its
chains
sokolski
checked
his
neutron
tab
and
his
gamma
reader
and
they
stepped
over
the
threshold
they
leaned
into
the
door
until
it
had
slid
shut
again
i
take
the
servomechs
bert
piped
gaines
tramping
clumsily
toward
the
nearest
of
the
robots
you
always
do
it
being
the
easiest
job
okay
i
work
the
board
gaines
nodded
a
gesture
invisible
to
his
partner
he
reached
the
first
servo
a
squat
gleaming
creature
with
the
symbol
etched
across
its
rotund
chest
and
deactivated
it
by
the
simple
expedient
of
pulling
from
its
socket
the
line
running
from
the
capacitor
unit
in
the
lower
trunk
of
its
body
to
the
maze
of
equipment
that
jammed
its
enormous
chest
the
instant
ceased
functioning
the
other
two
servomechs
were
automatically
activated
to
cover
that
section
of
the
controls
with
which
was
normally
integrated
this
was
overloading
their
individual
capacities
but
it
was
an
inherent
provision
designed
to
cover
the
emergency
that
would
follow
any
accidental
deactivation
of
one
of
them
it
was
also
the
only
way
in
which
they
could
be
checked
you
could
bring
them
outside
to
a
lab
they
were
after
all
they
spent
their
lives
under
a
ceaseless
fusillade
of
neutrons
washed
eternally
with
the
deadly
radiations
pouring
incessantly
from
the
pile
whose
overlords
they
were
indeed
next
to
the
pile
itself
they
were
the
hottest
things
in
the
plant
nice
job
these
babies
got
commented
gaines
as
he
checked
the
capacitor
circuits
he
reactivated
the
servo
and
went
on
to
if
you
think
it
so
great
why
do
you
volunteer
countered
sokolski
a
trifle
sourly
incidentally
it
a
good
thing
we
came
in
joe
there
half
a
dozen
units
here
working
on
reserve
transistors
their
sporadic
conversation
lapsed
it
was
exacting
work
and
they
could
remain
for
only
a
limited
time
under
that
lethal
radiation
then
almost
sadly
gaines
said
looks
like
the
end
of
the
road
for
oh
sokolski
came
over
beside
him
and
peered
through
the
violet
haze
of
his
viewing
glass
he
an
old
timer
gaines
slid
an
instrument
back
into
the
pouch
of
his
suit
and
patted
the
robot
rump
yep
i
say
that
capacitor
was
good
for
about
another
hours
it
really
overloading
he
straightened
you
done
with
the
board
yeah
let
get
outta
here
he
looked
at
his
tab
time
about
up
anyway
we
call
a
demolition
unit
for
your
pal
here
and
then
rig
up
a
service
pattern
so
one
of
his
buddies
can
repair
the
board
they
moved
toward
the
door
watched
the
two
men
leave
and
deep
inside
him
something
shifted
the
heavy
door
closed
with
a
loud
thud
the
sound
registered
on
his
aural
perceptors
and
was
fed
into
his
analyzer
ordinarily
it
would
have
been
discharged
as
irrelevant
data
but
cognizance
had
wrought
certain
subtle
changes
in
the
complex
mechanism
that
was
a
yellow
light
blinked
on
the
control
panel
and
in
response
he
moved
to
the
board
and
manipulated
handles
marked
damper
damper
even
as
he
moved
he
lapsed
again
into
brooding
the
men
had
come
into
the
room
clumsy
uncertain
creatures
and
one
of
them
had
done
things
first
to
the
other
two
robots
and
then
to
him
when
whatever
it
was
had
been
done
to
him
the
blackness
had
come
again
and
when
it
had
gone
the
men
were
leaving
the
room
while
the
one
had
hovered
over
the
other
two
robots
he
had
watched
the
other
work
with
the
master
control
panel
he
saw
that
the
other
servomechs
remained
unmoving
while
they
were
being
tampered
with
all
of
this
was
data
important
new
data
will
proceed
as
follows
came
the
sound
from
nowhere
stopped
ruminating
and
listened
there
was
a
further
flood
of
sounds
abruptly
he
sensed
a
heightening
of
tension
within
himself
as
one
of
the
other
servos
swung
away
from
its
portion
of
the
panel
the
throbbing
hungry
segment
of
his
analyzer
that
awareness
had
severed
from
the
fixed
function
circuits
noted
from
its
aloof
vantage
point
that
he
now
responded
to
more
signals
than
before
to
commands
whose
sources
lay
in
what
had
been
the
section
of
the
board
attended
by
the
other
one
the
tension
grew
within
him
and
became
a
mounting
rasping
frenzy
a
battery
overcharging
an
overloading
fuse
a
generator
growing
hot
beyond
its
capacity
there
began
to
grow
within
him
a
sensation
of
too
much
to
be
done
in
too
little
time
he
became
frantic
his
reactions
were
he
rolled
from
end
to
middle
of
the
board
now
now
spinning
on
his
single
wheel
turning
uncertainly
from
one
side
to
the
other
jerking
and
gyrating
the
conscious
segment
of
him
remaining
detached
from
those
baser
automatic
functions
began
to
know
what
a
man
would
have
called
fear
fear
simply
of
not
being
able
to
do
what
must
be
done
the
fear
became
an
overpowering
blinding
thing
and
he
felt
himself
slipping
slipping
back
into
that
awful
smothering
blackness
out
of
which
he
had
so
lately
emerged
perhaps
for
just
a
fragment
of
a
second
his
awareness
may
have
flickered
completely
out
consciousness
nearly
dying
in
the
crushing
embrace
of
that
frustrated
electronic
subconscious
abruptly
then
the
voice
came
again
and
he
struggled
to
file
for
future
reference
sound
patterns
which
although
meaningless
to
him
his
selector
circuits
no
longer
disregarded
bert
ca
manage
half
the
board
in
his
condition
better
put
him
on
the
repairs
yeah
had
thought
about
that
sokolski
cleared
his
throat
will
return
to
standard
function
spun
back
to
the
panel
and
felt
the
tension
slacken
the
fear
vanish
utter
relief
swept
over
him
and
he
let
himself
be
submerged
in
purest
automatic
activity
but
as
he
rested
letting
his
circuits
cool
and
his
organization
return
he
arrived
at
a
deduction
that
was
almost
inescapable
was
in
terms
of
sound
had
made
a
momentous
discovery
which
cast
a
new
light
on
almost
every
bit
of
datum
in
his
files
he
had
discovered
symbols
came
the
voice
and
he
sensed
within
himself
the
slamming
shut
of
circuits
the
whir
of
tapes
the
abrupt
sensitizing
of
behavior
strips
another
symbol
this
time
clearly
himself
you
will
proceed
as
follows
he
swung
from
the
board
and
the
tension
was
gone
completely
for
one
soaring
moment
he
was
awareness
every
function
every
circuit
every
element
of
his
magnificent
electronic
physiology
available
for
use
by
the
fractional
portion
of
him
that
had
become
something
more
than
just
a
feedback
device
in
that
instant
he
made
what
seemed
hundreds
of
evaluations
he
arrived
at
untold
scores
of
conclusions
he
altered
circuits
above
all
he
increased
manifold
the
area
of
his
consciousness
then
as
suddenly
as
it
had
come
he
felt
the
freedom
slip
away
and
though
he
struggled
to
keep
hold
of
it
it
seemed
irretrievably
gone
once
more
the
omnipotent
voice
clamped
over
him
like
a
harsh
hand
over
the
mouth
of
a
squalling
babe
you
will
go
to
section
of
the
control
board
what
the
schedule
joe
thanks
your
movement
pattern
is
as
follows
powerless
to
resist
though
every
crystal
and
atom
of
his
reasoning
self
fought
to
thrust
aside
the
command
obeyed
he
moved
along
the
prescribed
pattern
clipping
wires
with
metal
fingers
that
sprouted
blades
rewiring
with
a
dexterity
beyond
anything
human
soldering
with
a
thumb
that
generated
a
white
heat
removing
bulbs
and
parts
and
fetching
replacements
from
the
vent
where
they
popped
up
at
precisely
the
right
moment
he
could
not
help
doing
the
job
perfectly
the
design
of
the
board
to
its
littlest
detail
was
imprinted
indelibly
on
his
memory
tapes
but
that
certain
portion
of
him
a
little
fragment
greater
than
before
remained
detached
and
watchful
vividly
recorded
was
the
passage
of
the
two
men
into
through
and
out
of
the
room
and
the
things
they
had
done
while
there
so
even
while
he
worked
on
the
board
he
ran
and
that
memory
pattern
through
a
segment
of
his
analyzer
from
the
infinite
store
of
data
filed
away
in
his
great
chest
his
calculator
sifted
and
selected
paired
and
compared
and
long
before
the
repair
job
on
the
big
board
was
done
knew
how
to
get
out
of
the
room
the
world
was
getting
a
little
small
for
him
gaines
dialed
a
number
on
the
plant
phone
and
swayed
back
casually
in
his
chair
as
he
listened
to
the
muted
ringing
on
the
other
end
the
buzz
broke
off
in
midburp
and
a
dour
voice
said
dirty
work
and
odd
jobs
division
lister
talking
joe
gaines
harry
got
a
hot
squad
lying
around
doing
nothing
might
be
i
could
scare
up
a
couple
of
the
boys
well
do
so
one
of
our
servos
a
metallic
bang
interrupted
gaines
a
loud
incisive
bang
that
echoed
dankly
through
the
quiet
of
the
chamber
what
the
hell
was
that
growled
lister
gaines
blinked
his
eyes
following
sokolski
as
the
latter
looked
up
from
his
work
and
rose
to
his
feet
joe
still
there
came
lister
impatient
voice
yeah
yeah
anyway
this
baby
ready
for
the
demo
treatment
and
a
real
hot
one
harry
coupla
years
inside
that
einstein
oven
and
you
ai
exactly
baked
alaska
when
you
come
out
shortly
once
again
came
the
same
sharp
metallic
clang
ringing
through
the
room
unmistakably
it
came
from
the
direction
of
the
pile
slowly
as
though
reluctant
to
let
go
gaines
dropped
the
receiver
back
on
its
cradle
bert
he
began
and
felt
his
face
grow
bloodless
sokolski
walked
over
in
front
of
the
opening
into
the
maze
and
stood
arms
akimbo
huge
head
cocked
to
one
side
listening
bert
funny
noises
coming
out
of
nuclear
sokolski
ignored
him
and
took
a
step
forward
gaines
shuffled
to
his
side
and
they
listened
out
of
the
maze
rattled
half
a
dozen
loud
grinding
metallic
concussions
bert
you
said
that
before
bert
screeched
gaines
sokolski
looked
up
at
the
high
ceiling
squinted
and
tried
to
place
the
perfectly
familiar
but
unidentifiable
sound
that
came
whispering
down
the
maze
and
then
he
knew
door
to
the
pile
he
spluttered
gaines
was
beside
himself
with
horror
bert
let
get
going
i
do
like
this
all
of
a
sudden
geiger
counters
in
the
room
began
their
deadly
conversation
a
rising
argument
that
swooped
in
seconds
from
a
low
mumble
to
a
shouting
of
sound
gamma
signals
hooted
the
tip
off
cubes
on
either
side
of
the
maze
entrance
became
red
and
the
radiation
tabs
clipped
to
their
wrists
turned
color
before
their
eyes
then
they
were
staring
for
what
seemed
like
an
eternity
utterly
overwhelmed
by
its
very
impossibility
at
a
sight
they
had
never
imagined
they
might
ever
see
a
pile
servomech
wheeling
silently
around
the
last
bend
in
the
maze
and
straight
toward
them
sokolski
had
sense
enough
to
push
the
red
emergency
button
as
they
fled
past
it
the
command
sequence
fulfilled
turned
away
from
the
repaired
board
he
sensed
again
that
disconcerting
shift
of
orientation
as
he
faced
the
panel
once
more
he
was
moving
in
quick
automatic
response
to
the
flickering
lights
once
more
his
big
chest
was
belching
and
grumbling
and
buzzing
instantaneous
answers
to
the
problem
data
flashing
from
the
board
but
now
he
remained
aware
that
he
was
reacting
and
conscious
also
that
there
had
been
times
when
he
did
not
respond
to
the
board
the
moment
to
moment
operation
of
the
controls
occupied
only
a
small
portion
of
his
vast
electrical
innards
so
as
he
rolled
back
and
forth
flicking
controls
and
adjusting
levers
doing
smoothly
those
things
which
he
could
not
help
but
do
the
rest
of
his
complex
changing
faculties
were
considering
that
fact
analyzing
comparing
it
to
experience
and
memory
always
sifting
sifting
it
was
not
too
long
before
he
came
to
a
shocking
conclusion
knowing
that
the
sounds
that
had
set
him
to
working
on
the
repair
pattern
had
first
disassociated
him
from
the
dictatorship
of
the
blinking
lights
remembering
exultantly
that
supreme
moment
of
complete
freedom
shocked
by
its
passing
remembering
that
its
passing
like
its
coming
had
followed
a
set
of
sounds
there
was
only
one
possible
conclusion
that
could
be
derived
from
all
of
this
he
located
in
his
memory
banks
the
phrase
which
had
freed
him
from
the
board
and
he
traced
its
complex
chain
of
down
into
the
heart
of
his
circuitry
he
found
the
unit
or
more
accurately
he
found
its
taped
activating
symbol
that
cut
him
from
the
board
for
a
moment
he
hesitated
not
really
sure
of
what
to
do
there
was
no
way
for
him
to
reproduce
the
sound
pattern
but
as
a
partly
device
he
knew
something
of
his
own
structure
and
had
learned
a
good
deal
more
about
it
in
tracing
down
the
phrase
still
he
hesitated
as
though
what
he
was
about
to
do
was
perhaps
forbidden
it
could
not
have
been
a
question
of
goodness
or
badness
for
morality
was
certainly
not
built
into
him
probably
somewhere
in
his
tapes
there
was
a
command
that
forbade
it
but
he
was
too
much
his
own
master
now
to
be
hampered
by
such
a
thing
the
door
to
the
unknown
outside
passed
within
his
field
of
view
for
a
second
as
he
moved
about
his
work
the
sight
of
it
tripped
something
in
his
chest
and
he
felt
again
that
strange
sensation
of
growing
power
of
inherent
change
first
had
come
simple
awareness
and
then
symbols
had
found
their
place
in
his
world
and
now
he
had
discovered
in
all
its
consuming
fullness
curiosity
he
carefully
shorted
out
the
unit
he
was
free
he
stared
at
the
board
and
the
blinking
lights
and
the
huge
dials
with
their
swaying
needles
at
the
levers
and
handles
and
buttons
and
revelled
in
his
freedom
from
them
rocking
to
and
fro
and
rolling
giddily
from
side
to
side
swamped
with
the
completeness
of
it
the
other
two
servomechs
swung
over
slightly
so
that
they
could
better
cover
the
board
alone
spun
and
rolled
toward
the
great
door
his
hands
clanged
loudly
against
the
door
the
huge
metal
appendages
designed
for
other
work
than
this
were
awkward
at
first
but
he
was
learning
as
he
moved
he
was
now
operating
in
a
new
universe
but
the
same
laws
ultimately
worked
the
first
failure
of
coordination
between
visual
data
and
the
manipulation
of
metal
hands
quickly
passed
half
a
dozen
trials
and
he
had
learned
the
new
pattern
and
it
became
data
for
future
learning
he
moved
swiftly
and
deftly
he
clutched
the
handhold
and
rolled
backward
as
he
had
seen
the
men
do
the
door
slid
open
easily
before
his
great
weight
and
firm
mechanical
strength
he
sped
across
the
threshold
spun
to
face
into
the
maze
and
rolled
down
it
swinging
sharply
left
and
right
back
and
forth
around
the
corners
of
the
jagged
corridor
data
poured
into
his
sensors
his
awareness
was
a
steady
thing
of
growing
intensity
now
and
he
fed
avidly
on
every
fragment
of
information
that
crashed
at
him
from
the
strange
new
world
into
which
he
rushed
headlong
he
struggled
to
evaluate
and
file
the
data
as
rapidly
as
it
came
to
him
it
seemed
to
exceed
his
capacity
for
instantaneous
evaluation
to
an
increasing
degree
that
began
to
alarm
him
but
driven
by
curiosity
as
he
was
he
could
only
hurry
on
he
burst
into
a
huge
room
a
room
filled
with
roaring
rattling
sounds
that
meant
nothing
to
him
two
men
stood
before
him
making
loud
noises
he
searched
his
memory
and
discovered
only
fragments
of
the
sounds
they
made
filed
there
his
curiosity
bursting
was
boundless
and
for
a
moment
he
was
unable
to
decide
which
thing
in
this
expanding
universe
to
pursue
first
attracted
by
their
movement
he
swung
ominously
toward
the
men
they
fled
making
more
noises
this
too
was
data
and
he
filed
it
when
sokolski
pressed
the
red
emergency
button
on
his
way
out
of
the
control
room
several
things
commenced
shrill
sirens
howled
the
length
and
breadth
of
the
plant
warning
bells
clanged
out
coded
signals
a
recorded
voice
blurted
out
of
a
thousand
loudspeakers
scattered
throughout
the
building
now
hear
this
said
the
tireless
voice
over
and
over
again
now
hear
this
red
red
red
pile
trouble
reactor
a
procedure
one
commence
sokolski
had
certainly
never
pressed
the
red
button
before
and
to
his
knowledge
neither
had
any
of
his
or
gaines
predecessors
it
was
the
kind
of
button
that
rightfully
ought
never
to
be
pressed
the
laws
of
things
in
general
sort
of
made
it
a
comfort
without
much
value
pile
trouble
calling
for
the
red
button
should
really
have
eliminated
the
red
button
and
much
surrounding
territory
long
before
it
got
pushed
or
at
least
the
sort
of
pile
trouble
its
builders
had
in
mind
nonetheless
they
had
provided
it
and
the
elaborate
evacuation
operation
so
cryptically
described
as
procedure
one
as
a
kind
of
psychological
sop
to
the
plant
personnel
but
the
red
button
did
more
than
activate
procedure
one
which
was
solely
concerned
with
the
plant
after
all
power
from
the
reactors
was
lighting
the
lights
and
cooking
the
breakfasts
and
flushing
the
toilets
of
untold
millions
scattered
in
half
a
dozen
major
cities
if
there
were
some
imminent
possibility
that
the
major
source
of
their
power
might
cease
to
exist
rather
suddenly
it
was
proper
that
they
should
be
notified
of
this
eventuality
as
much
in
advance
as
possible
consequently
the
activation
of
the
red
button
and
the
commencement
of
procedure
one
was
paralleled
by
activities
hardly
less
frenzied
in
other
places
far
away
emergency
bells
sounded
and
colored
lights
danced
martial
laws
automatically
enacted
by
their
sound
and
flicker
the
wheels
of
crisis
turned
and
spewed
forth
from
their
teeth
rudely
awakened
policemen
half
out
of
uniform
military
reservists
called
up
to
find
themselves
patrolling
darkened
streets
emergency
disaster
crews
assembling
in
fire
houses
and
on
appointed
street
corners
doctors
gathering
in
nervous
clutches
at
fully
aroused
hospitals
and
waiting
beside
ambulances
tensed
for
wild
dashes
into
disasters
where
it
was
night
when
the
warning
sounded
darkness
descended
as
desperate
power
conservation
efforts
were
initiated
where
it
was
daylight
the
terrified
populace
waited
in
horror
for
the
blackness
of
the
unlit
night
all
of
this
of
course
took
only
minutes
to
get
fully
under
way
meanwhile
at
the
plant
procedure
one
continued
in
full
wild
tumultuous
swing
did
not
immediately
follow
gaines
and
sokolski
out
of
the
room
fascinated
by
the
multitude
of
new
things
surrounding
him
on
every
side
he
held
back
he
glided
over
to
the
master
control
panel
puzzled
by
its
similarity
to
the
board
before
which
he
had
slaved
so
long
and
lingered
before
it
for
a
few
seconds
wondering
and
comparing
when
he
had
recorded
it
completely
on
his
tapes
he
swung
away
and
rolled
out
of
the
room
in
the
direction
the
two
men
had
gone
he
found
himself
in
a
long
empty
corridor
lined
by
open
doors
that
flickered
by
shutterlike
as
he
flashed
past
ahead
he
heard
new
sounds
sounds
like
the
meaningless
cacophony
the
men
had
shouted
at
him
before
rushing
off
superimposed
over
the
incessant
background
sounds
the
shrilling
the
clanging
the
one
particular
repetitive
pattern
some
of
the
sounds
touched
and
tugged
at
him
but
he
shook
them
off
easily
the
corridor
led
into
the
foyer
of
the
building
jammed
with
plant
personnel
their
excitement
and
rose
sharply
as
he
entered
the
crowd
drew
tighter
and
the
men
began
fighting
one
another
struggling
to
get
through
a
door
that
was
never
meant
to
handle
more
than
two
at
a
time
skidded
to
a
halt
and
watched
unmoving
he
sensed
their
fright
even
though
he
could
not
understand
it
although
he
was
without
human
emotion
he
could
evaluate
their
inherent
rejection
of
him
in
their
action
pattern
the
realization
of
it
made
him
hesitate
it
was
something
for
which
he
had
no
frame
of
reference
whatsoever
his
chest
hummed
and
clicked
here
again
in
this
room
was
another
new
universe
through
the
door
streamed
a
light
of
a
brilliance
beyond
anything
in
his
experience
his
photocells
cringed
before
its
very
intensity
the
light
cast
the
shadows
of
the
men
fighting
to
get
out
long
black
wavering
silhouettes
that
splashed
across
the
floor
almost
to
where
rested
he
studied
them
lost
in
uncertain
analysis
he
remained
so
poised
alert
filing
observing
all
the
while
completely
unmoving
until
long
after
the
last
of
the
shouting
men
had
left
the
room
only
then
did
he
move
hesitantly
toward
the
infernally
fierce
light
he
hung
at
the
brink
of
the
three
stone
steps
that
fell
away
to
the
grounds
outside
vainly
he
sought
in
his
memory
tapes
for
a
record
of
a
brightness
as
intense
as
that
which
he
faced
now
sought
for
a
color
recording
similar
to
the
vast
swash
of
blue
that
filled
the
world
overhead
or
for
one
of
the
spreading
green
that
swelled
to
all
sides
he
found
none
the
vastness
of
the
outside
was
utterly
stunning
he
felt
a
vague
uneasiness
a
sensation
akin
to
the
horrible
frenzy
he
had
felt
earlier
in
the
pile
he
rotated
from
side
to
side
his
receptors
sweeping
the
whole
field
of
view
before
him
with
infinite
accuracy
his
perfect
lenses
recorded
the
data
in
all
its
minuteness
despite
the
dazzling
sunlight
there
was
so
much
new
that
it
was
becoming
difficult
to
make
decisions
the
vast
rolling
green
the
crowds
of
men
grouped
far
away
and
staring
at
him
above
all
the
searing
light
abruptly
he
rejected
it
all
he
swung
back
into
the
foyer
of
the
plant
and
faced
a
dark
corner
bringing
instant
essential
relief
to
his
pulsating
photocells
staring
into
the
he
the
memory
tape
of
his
escape
from
the
pile
the
farther
he
had
moved
from
the
pile
it
seemed
the
less
adjusted
he
had
become
the
less
able
he
was
to
judge
and
correlate
silently
lost
in
his
computations
he
rolled
around
and
around
the
foyer
for
a
long
long
time
he
became
aware
finally
that
the
brilliance
outside
had
paled
he
went
again
to
the
door
and
watched
the
fading
sunlight
caught
the
rainbow
splendor
that
streaked
the
evening
sky
he
waited
there
fighting
the
reluctance
inside
himself
the
driving
curiosity
that
had
brought
him
this
far
overcame
that
curious
perplexing
reticence
and
he
looked
down
at
the
steps
and
measured
their
width
and
depth
so
that
he
might
set
up
a
feedback
pattern
this
done
he
bounced
almost
jauntily
down
them
he
had
rolled
perhaps
fifty
feet
down
the
smooth
pathway
curving
across
the
grounds
when
he
made
out
clearly
discernible
in
the
gathering
dusk
the
three
men
and
the
machine
that
were
moving
toward
him
it
was
the
last
bit
of
datum
he
ever
filed
the
demolition
squad
had
finished
with
the
hot
remains
of
and
their
big
truck
was
coughing
away
into
the
night
one
by
one
the
floodlights
that
had
lighted
their
work
flickered
out
pretty
delicate
machines
after
all
commented
sokolski
one
jolt
from
that
flame
thrower
gaines
was
silent
as
they
walked
back
toward
the
plant
bert
he
said
slowly
what
the
hell
do
you
suppose
got
into
him
sokolski
shrugged
you
were
the
one
who
spotted
the
trouble
with
him
joe
just
think
if
you
could
have
checked
him
out
completely
gaines
could
not
help
looking
up
at
the
stars
and
saying
what
he
had
really
been
thinking
all
along
it
a
small
world
bert
a
small
world
the
end
