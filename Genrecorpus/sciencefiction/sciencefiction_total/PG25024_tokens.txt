the
night
of
the
long
knives

leiber
illustrated
by
finlay
chapter
man
who
saw
you
or
even
heard
your
footsteps
must
be
ambushed
stalked
and
killed
whether
needed
for
food
or
not
otherwise
so
long
as
his
strength
held
out
he
would
be
on
your
the
hour
herbert
i
was
one
hundred
miles
from
nowhere
and
i
mean
that
literally
when
i
spotted
this
girl
out
of
the
corner
of
my
eye
i
been
keeping
an
extra
lookout
because
i
still
expected
the
other
undead
bugger
left
over
from
the
murder
party
at
nowhere
to
be
stalking
me
illustration
they
were
two
desperate
scavengers
in
a
land
of
radiation
and
death
i
been
following
a
line
of
towers
all
canted
over
at
the
same
gentlemanly
tipsy
angle
by
an
old
blast
from
the
last
war
i
judged
the
girl
was
going
in
the
same
general
direction
and
was
being
edged
over
toward
my
course
by
a
drift
of
dust
that
even
at
my
distance
showed
dangerous
metallic
gleams
and
dark
humps
that
might
be
dead
men
or
cattle
she
looked
slim
dark
topped
and
on
guard
small
like
me
and
like
me
wearing
a
scarf
loosely
around
the
lower
half
of
her
face
in
the
style
of
the
old
buckaroos
we
did
wave
or
turn
our
heads
or
give
the
slightest
indication
seen
each
other
as
our
paths
slowly
converged
but
we
were
intensely
minutely
watchful
i
knew
i
was
and
she
had
better
be
overhead
the
sky
was
a
low
dust
haze
as
always
i
do
remember
what
a
high
sky
looks
like
three
years
ago
i
think
i
saw
venus
or
it
may
have
been
sirius
or
jupiter
the
hot
smoky
light
was
turning
from
the
amber
of
midday
to
the
bloody
bronze
of
evening
the
line
of
towers
i
was
following
showed
the
faintest
spread
in
the
direction
of
their
canting
they
must
have
been
only
a
few
miles
from
blast
center
as
i
passed
each
one
i
could
see
where
the
metal
on
the
blast
side
had
been
eroded
vaporized
by
the
original
blast
mostly
smoothly
but
with
welts
and
pustules
where
the
metal
had
merely
melted
and
run
i
supposed
the
lines
the
towers
carried
had
all
been
vaporized
too
but
with
the
haze
i
could
be
sure
though
i
did
see
three
dark
blobs
up
there
that
might
be
vultures
perching
from
the
drift
around
the
foot
of
the
nearest
tower
a
human
skull
peered
whitely
that
is
rather
unusual
years
later
now
you
still
see
more
dead
bodies
with
the
meat
on
them
than
skeletons
intense
radiation
has
killed
their
bacteria
and
preserved
them
indefinitely
from
decay
just
like
the
packaged
meat
in
the
last
advertisements
in
fact
such
bodies
are
one
of
the
signs
of
a
really
hot
drift
you
avoid
them
the
vultures
pass
up
such
poisonously
hot
carrion
too
they
learned
their
lesson
ahead
some
big
gas
tanks
began
to
loom
up
like
deformed
battleships
and
in
a
smoke
screen
their
prows
being
the
juncture
of
the
natural
curve
of
the
side
with
the
massive
concavity
of
the
side
none
of
the
three
other
buggers
and
me
had
had
too
clear
an
idea
of
where
nowhere
had
been
hence
in
part
the
name
but
i
knew
in
a
general
way
that
i
was
somewhere
in
the
deathlands
between
porter
county
and
ouachita
parish
probably
much
nearer
the
former
it
a
real
america
we
got
these
days
you
know
with
just
the
faintest
trickle
of
a
sense
of
identity
left
like
a
guy
in
the
paddedest
cell
in
the
most
locked
up
ward
in
the
whole
loony
bin
if
a
time
traveler
from
mid
twentieth
century
hopped
forward
to
it
across
the
few
intervening
years
and
looked
at
a
map
of
it
if
anybody
has
a
map
of
it
he
think
that
the
map
had
run
that
it
had
got
some
sort
of
disease
that
had
swollen
a
few
tiny
parts
beyond
all
bounds
paper
tumors
while
most
of
the
other
parts
the
parts
he
remembered
carrying
names
in
such
big
print
and
showing
such
bold
colors
had
shrunk
to
nothingness
to
the
east
he
see
atlantic
highlands
and
savannah
fortress
to
the
west
walla
walla
territory
pacific
palisades
and
los
alamos
and
there
he
see
an
actual
change
in
the
coastline
i
told
where
three
of
the
biggest
stockpiles
of
fusionables
let
go
and
opened
death
valley
to
the
sea
so
that
los
alamos
is
closer
to
being
a
port
centrally
find
porter
county
and
manteno
asylum
surprisingly
close
together
near
the
great
lakes
which
are
tilted
and
spilled
out
a
bit
toward
the
southwest
with
the
big
quake
ouachita
parish
inching
up
the
mississippi
from
old
louisiana
under
the
cruel
urging
of
the
fisher
sheriffs
those
he
find
and
a
few
a
very
few
other
places
including
a
couple
i
suppose
i
have
heard
of
practically
all
of
them
would
surprise
him
no
one
can
predict
what
scraps
of
a
blasted
nation
are
going
to
hang
onto
a
shred
of
organization
and
ruthlessly
maintain
it
and
very
slowly
and
very
jealously
extend
it
but
biggest
of
all
occupying
practically
all
the
map
reducing
all
those
swollen
localities
i
mentioned
back
to
tiny
blobs
bounding
most
of
america
and
thrusting
its
jetty
pseudopods
everywhere
he
see
the
great
inkblot
of
the
deathlands
i
do
know
how
else
than
by
an
area
of
solid
absolutely
unrelieved
black
you
represent
the
deathlands
with
its
multicolored
radioactive
dusts
and
its
skimpy
freightage
of
lonely
deathlanders
each
bound
on
his
murderous
utterly
pointless
but
utterly
absorbing
business
an
area
where
names
like
nowhere
it
anywhere
and
the
place
are
the
most
natural
thing
in
the
world
when
a
few
of
us
decide
to
try
to
pad
down
together
for
a
few
nervous
months
or
weeks
as
i
say
i
was
somewhere
in
the
deathlands
near
manteno
asylum
the
girl
and
me
were
getting
closer
now
well
within
pistol
or
dart
range
though
beyond
any
but
the
most
expert
or
lucky
knife
throw
she
wore
boots
and
a
weathered
shirt
and
jeans
the
black
topping
was
hair
piled
high
in
an
elaborate
coiffure
that
was
held
in
place
by
twisted
shavings
of
bright
metal
a
fine
i
told
myself
in
her
left
hand
which
was
closest
to
me
she
carried
a
dart
gun
pointed
away
from
me
across
her
body
it
was
the
kind
of
potent
tiny
crossbow
you
ca
easily
tell
whether
the
spring
is
loaded
back
around
on
her
left
hip
a
small
leather
satchel
was
strapped
to
her
belt
also
on
the
same
side
were
two
sheathed
knives
one
of
which
was
an
oddity
it
had
no
handle
just
the
bare
tang
for
nothing
but
throwing
i
guessed
i
let
my
own
left
hand
drift
a
little
closer
to
my
banker
special
in
its
open
holster
ray
baker
great
psychological
weapon
though
who
knows
the
two
cartridges
it
contained
might
actually
fire
the
one
i
put
to
the
test
at
nowhere
had
and
very
lucky
for
me
she
seemed
to
be
hiding
her
right
arm
from
me
then
i
spotted
the
weapon
it
held
one
you
do
often
see
a
stevedore
hook
she
hiding
her
right
hand
all
right
she
had
the
long
sleeve
pulled
down
over
it
so
just
the
hook
stuck
out
i
asked
myself
if
the
hand
were
perhaps
covered
with
radiation
scars
or
sores
or
otherwise
disfigured
we
deathlanders
have
our
vanities
i
sensitive
about
my
baldness
then
she
let
her
right
arm
swing
more
freely
and
i
saw
how
short
it
was
she
had
no
right
hand
the
hook
was
attached
to
the
wrist
stump
i
judged
she
was
about
ten
years
younger
than
me
i
pushing
forty
i
think
though
some
people
have
judged
i
younger
no
way
of
my
knowing
for
sure
in
this
life
you
forget
trifles
like
chronology
anyway
the
age
difference
meant
she
would
have
quicker
reflexes
have
to
keep
that
in
mind
the
greenishly
glinting
dust
drift
that
i
judged
she
was
avoiding
swung
closer
ahead
the
girl
left
elbow
gave
a
little
kick
to
the
satchel
on
her
hip
and
there
was
a
sudden
burst
of
irregular
ticks
that
almost
made
me
start
i
steadied
myself
and
concentrated
on
thinking
whether
i
should
attach
any
special
significance
to
her
carrying
a
geiger
counter
naturally
it
was
the
sort
of
thinking
that
interfered
in
any
way
with
my
watchfulness
you
quickly
lose
the
habit
of
that
kind
of
thinking
in
the
deathlands
or
you
lose
something
else
it
could
mean
she
was
some
sort
of
greenhorn
most
of
us
can
visually
judge
the
heat
of
a
dust
drift
or
crater
or
rayed
area
more
reliably
than
any
instrument
some
buggers
claim
they
just
feel
it
though
i
never
known
any
of
the
latter
too
eager
to
navigate
in
unfamiliar
country
at
night
which
you
think
they
be
willing
to
do
if
they
could
feel
heat
blind
but
she
did
look
one
bit
like
a
tenderfoot
like
for
instance
some
citizeness
newly
banished
from
manteno
or
like
some
porter
unfaithful
wife
or
troublesome
girlfriend
whom
he
personally
carted
out
beyond
the
ridges
of
hot
dust
that
help
guard
such
places
and
then
abandoned
in
revenge
or
from
boredom
and
they
call
themselves
civilized
those
cultural
queers
no
she
looked
like
she
in
the
deathlands
but
then
why
the
counter
her
eyes
might
be
bad
real
bad
i
did
think
so
she
raised
her
boot
an
extra
inch
to
step
over
a
little
jagged
fragment
of
concrete
no
maybe
she
was
just
a
born
using
science
to
back
up
knowledge
based
on
experience
as
rich
as
my
own
or
richer
i
met
the
type
before
they
mostly
get
along
pretty
well
but
they
tend
to
be
a
shade
too
slow
in
the
clutches
maybe
she
was
the
counter
planning
to
use
it
some
other
way
or
trade
it
for
something
maybe
she
made
a
practice
of
traveling
by
night
then
the
counter
made
good
sense
but
then
why
use
it
by
day
why
reveal
it
to
me
in
any
case
was
she
trying
to
convince
me
that
she
was
a
greenhorn
or
had
she
hoped
that
the
sudden
noise
would
throw
me
off
guard
but
who
would
go
to
the
trouble
of
carrying
a
geiger
counter
for
such
devious
purposes
and
would
she
have
waited
until
we
got
closer
before
trying
the
noise
gambit
it
gets
you
nowhere
she
kicked
off
the
counter
with
another
bump
of
her
elbow
and
started
to
edge
in
toward
me
faster
i
turned
the
thinking
all
off
and
gave
my
whole
mind
to
watchfulness
soon
we
were
barely
more
than
eight
feet
apart
almost
within
lunging
range
without
even
the
preliminary
step
and
still
we
spoken
or
looked
straight
at
each
other
though
being
that
close
had
to
cant
our
heads
around
a
bit
to
keep
each
other
in
peripheral
vision
our
eyes
would
be
on
each
other
steadily
for
five
or
six
seconds
then
dart
forward
an
instant
to
check
for
rocks
and
holes
in
the
trail
we
were
following
in
parallel
a
cultural
queer
from
one
of
the
civilized
places
would
have
found
it
funny
i
suppose
if
been
able
to
watch
us
perform
in
an
arena
or
from
behind
armor
glass
for
his
exclusive
pleasure
the
girl
had
eyebrows
as
black
as
her
hair
which
in
its
and
savagery
called
to
mind
african
queens
despite
her
typical
pale
complexion
very
little
ultraviolet
gets
through
the
dust
from
the
inside
corner
of
her
right
eye
socket
a
narrow
radiation
scar
ran
up
between
her
eyebrows
and
across
her
forehead
at
a
rakish
angle
until
it
disappeared
under
a
sweep
of
hair
at
the
upper
left
corner
of
her
forehead
i
been
smelling
her
of
course
for
some
time
i
could
even
tell
the
color
of
her
eyes
now
they
were
blue
it
a
color
you
never
see
almost
no
dusts
have
a
bluish
cast
there
are
few
blue
objects
except
certain
dark
steels
the
sky
never
gets
very
far
away
from
the
orange
range
though
it
is
green
from
time
to
time
and
water
reflects
the
sky
yes
she
had
blue
eyes
blue
eyes
and
that
jaunty
scar
blue
eyes
and
that
jaunty
scar
and
a
dart
gun
and
a
steel
hook
for
a
right
hand
and
we
were
walking
side
by
side
eight
feet
apart
not
an
inch
closer
still
not
looking
straight
at
each
other
still
not
saying
a
word
and
i
realized
that
the
initial
period
of
unadulterated
watchfulness
was
over
that
i
had
adequate
opportunity
to
inspect
this
girl
and
size
her
up
and
that
night
was
coming
on
fast
and
that
here
i
was
once
again
back
with
problem
of
the
two
i
could
try
either
to
kill
her
or
go
to
bed
with
her
i
know
that
at
this
point
the
cultural
queers
and
certainly
our
imaginary
time
traveler
from
mid
twentieth
century
would
make
a
great
noise
about
not
understanding
and
not
believing
in
the
genuineness
of
the
simple
urge
to
murder
that
governs
the
lives
of
us
deathlanders
like
pundits
they
would
say
that
a
man
or
woman
murders
for
gain
or
concealment
of
crime
or
from
thwarted
sexual
desire
or
outraged
sexual
possessiveness
and
maybe
they
would
list
a
few
other
rational
motives
but
not
they
would
say
just
for
the
simple
sake
of
murder
for
the
sure
release
and
relief
it
gives
for
the
sake
of
wiping
out
one
recognizable
bit
more
the
closest
bit
we
can
since
those
of
us
with
the
courage
or
lazy
rationality
to
wipe
out
ourselves
have
long
since
done
so
wiping
out
one
recognizable
bit
more
of
the
whole
miserable
unutterably
disgusting
human
mess
unless
they
would
say
a
person
is
completely
insane
which
is
actually
how
all
outsiders
view
us
deathlanders
they
can
think
of
us
in
no
other
way
i
guess
cultural
queers
and
time
travelers
simply
understand
though
to
be
so
blind
it
seems
to
me
that
they
have
to
overlook
much
of
the
history
of
the
last
war
and
of
the
subsequent
years
especially
the
mushrooming
of
crackpot
cults
with
a
murder
tinge
the
werewolf
gangs
the
berserkers
and
amuckers
the
revival
of
shiva
worship
and
the
black
mass
the
machine
wreckers
the
movements
the
new
witchcraft
the
unholy
creepers
the
unconsciousers
the
radioactive
blue
gods
and
rocket
devils
of
the
atomites
and
a
dozen
other
groupings
clearly
prefiguring
deathlander
psychology
those
cults
had
all
been
as
unpredictable
as
thuggee
or
the
dancing
madness
of
the
middle
ages
or
the
children
crusade
yet
they
had
happened
just
the
same
but
cultural
queers
are
good
at
overlooking
things
they
have
to
be
i
suppose
they
think
they
humanity
growing
again
yes
despite
their
laughable
warpedness
and
hysterical
crippledness
they
actually
believe
each
howlingly
different
community
of
them
that
they
the
new
adams
and
eves
they
all
excited
about
themselves
and
whether
or
not
they
wear
fig
leaves
they
do
carry
with
them
hours
a
day
like
us
deathlanders
do
the
burden
of
all
that
was
forever
lost
since
i
gone
this
far
i
go
a
bit
further
and
make
the
paradoxical
admission
that
even
us
deathlanders
do
really
understand
our
urge
to
murder
oh
we
have
our
rationalizations
of
it
just
like
everyone
has
of
his
ruling
passion
we
call
ourselves
junkmen
scavengers
gangrene
surgeons
we
sometimes
believe
we
doing
the
person
we
kill
the
ultimate
kindness
yes
and
get
slobbery
tearful
about
it
afterwards
we
sometimes
tell
ourselves
we
finally
found
and
are
rubbing
out
the
one
man
or
woman
who
was
responsible
for
everything
we
talk
mostly
to
ourselves
about
the
aesthetics
of
homicide
we
occasionally
admit
but
only
each
to
himself
alone
that
we
just
plain
nuts
but
we
do
really
understand
our
urge
to
murder
we
only
it
at
the
hateful
sight
of
another
human
being
we
feel
it
begins
to
grow
in
us
until
it
becomes
an
overpowering
impulse
that
jerks
us
like
a
puppet
is
jerked
by
its
strings
into
the
act
itself
or
its
attempted
commission
like
i
was
feeling
it
grow
in
me
now
as
we
did
this
parallel
deathmarch
through
the
reddening
haze
me
and
this
girl
and
our
problem
this
girl
with
the
blue
eyes
and
the
jaunty
scar
the
problem
of
the
urges
i
said
the
other
urge
the
sexual
is
one
that
i
know
all
cultural
queers
and
certainly
our
time
traveler
would
claim
to
know
all
about
maybe
they
do
but
i
wonder
if
they
understand
how
intense
it
can
be
with
us
deathlanders
when
it
the
only
release
except
maybe
liquor
and
drugs
which
we
seldom
can
get
and
even
more
rarely
dare
use
the
only
complete
release
even
though
a
brief
one
from
the
overpowering
loneliness
and
from
the
tyranny
of
the
urge
to
kill
to
embrace
to
possess
to
glut
lust
on
yes
even
briefly
to
love
briefly
to
shelter
in
that
was
good
that
was
a
relief
and
release
to
be
treasured
but
it
could
last
you
could
draw
it
out
prop
it
up
perhaps
for
a
few
days
for
a
month
even
though
sometimes
not
for
a
single
night
you
might
even
start
to
talk
to
each
other
a
little
after
a
while
but
it
could
never
last
the
glands
always
tire
if
nothing
else
murder
was
the
only
solution
the
only
release
only
us
deathlanders
know
how
good
it
feels
but
then
after
the
kill
the
loneliness
would
come
back
redoubled
and
after
a
while
i
meet
another
hateful
human
problem
of
the
two
urges
as
i
watched
this
girl
slogging
along
parallel
to
me
as
i
kept
constant
watch
on
her
of
course
i
wondered
how
was
feeling
the
two
urges
was
she
attracted
to
the
ridgy
scars
on
my
cheeks
half
revealed
by
my
scarf
to
me
they
have
a
pleasing
symmetry
was
she
wondering
how
my
head
and
face
looked
without
the
black
felt
skullcap
over
my
eyes
or
was
she
thinking
mostly
of
that
hook
swinging
into
my
throat
under
the
chin
and
dragging
me
down
i
could
tell
she
looked
as
as
i
was
trying
to
for
that
matter
i
asked
myself
how
was
feeling
the
two
urges
how
was
i
feeling
them
as
i
watched
this
girl
with
the
blue
eyes
and
the
jaunty
scar
and
the
arrogantly
thinned
lips
that
asked
to
be
smashed
and
the
slender
throat
and
i
realized
that
there
was
no
way
to
describe
that
not
even
to
myself
i
could
only
feel
the
two
urges
grow
in
me
side
by
side
like
monstrous
twins
until
they
would
simply
be
too
big
for
my
taut
body
and
one
of
them
would
have
to
get
out
fast
i
do
know
which
one
of
us
started
to
slow
down
first
it
happened
so
gradually
but
the
dust
puffs
that
rise
from
the
ground
of
the
deathlands
under
even
the
lightest
treading
became
smaller
and
smaller
around
our
steps
and
finally
vanished
altogether
and
we
were
standing
still
only
then
did
i
notice
the
obvious
physical
trigger
for
our
stopping
an
old
freeway
ran
at
right
angles
across
our
path
the
shoulder
by
which
we
approached
it
was
sharply
eroded
so
that
the
pavement
which
even
had
a
shallow
cave
eroded
under
it
was
a
good
three
feet
above
the
level
of
our
path
forming
a
low
wall
from
where
i
stopped
i
could
almost
reach
out
and
touch
the
concrete
so
could
she
we
were
right
in
the
midst
of
the
gas
tanks
now
six
or
seven
of
them
towered
around
us
squeezed
like
beer
cans
by
the
blast
but
their
metal
looking
sound
enough
until
you
became
aware
of
the
red
light
showing
through
in
odd
patterns
of
dots
and
dashes
where
vaporization
or
later
erosion
had
been
complete
almost
but
not
quite
just
ahead
of
us
right
across
the
freeway
was
the
skeletal
structure
of
an
old
cracking
plant
sagged
like
the
power
towers
away
from
the
blast
and
the
lower
storeys
drifted
with
piles
and
ridges
and
smooth
gobbets
of
dust
the
light
was
getting
redder
and
smokier
every
minute
with
the
cessation
of
the
physical
movement
of
walking
which
is
always
some
sort
of
release
for
emotions
i
could
feel
the
twin
urges
growing
faster
in
me
but
that
was
all
right
i
told
myself
this
was
the
crisis
as
she
must
realize
too
and
that
should
key
us
up
to
bear
the
urges
a
little
longer
without
explosion
i
was
the
first
to
start
to
turn
my
head
for
the
first
time
i
looked
straight
into
her
eyes
and
she
into
mine
and
as
always
happens
at
such
times
a
third
urge
appeared
abruptly
an
urge
momentarily
as
strong
as
the
other
two
the
urge
to
speak
to
tell
and
ask
all
about
it
but
even
as
i
started
to
phrase
the
first
crazily
happy
greeting
my
throat
lumped
as
i
known
it
would
with
the
awful
melancholy
of
all
that
was
forever
lost
with
the
uselessness
of
any
communication
with
the
impossibility
of
recreating
the
past
our
individual
pasts
any
pasts
and
as
it
always
does
the
third
urge
died
i
could
tell
she
was
feeling
that
ultimate
pain
just
like
me
i
could
see
her
eyelids
squeeze
down
on
her
eyes
and
her
face
lift
and
her
shoulders
go
back
as
she
swallowed
hard
she
was
the
first
to
start
to
lay
aside
a
weapon
she
took
two
sidewise
steps
toward
the
freeway
and
reached
her
whole
left
arm
further
across
her
body
and
laid
the
dart
gun
on
the
concrete
and
drew
back
her
hand
from
it
about
six
inches
at
the
same
time
looking
at
me
hard
fiercely
angrily
you
say
across
her
left
shoulder
she
had
the
experienced
duelist
trick
of
seeming
to
look
into
my
eyes
but
actually
focussing
on
my
mouth
i
was
using
the
same
gimmick
myself
it
tiring
to
look
straight
into
another
person
eyes
and
it
can
put
you
off
guard
my
left
side
was
nearest
the
wall
so
i
did
for
the
moment
have
the
problem
of
reaching
across
my
body
i
took
the
same
sidewise
steps
she
had
and
using
just
two
fingers
very
gingerly
i
hoped
i
lifted
my
antique
firearm
from
its
holster
and
laid
it
on
the
concrete
and
drew
back
my
hand
from
it
all
the
way
now
it
was
up
to
her
again
or
should
be
her
hook
was
going
to
be
quite
a
problem
i
realized
but
we
need
come
to
it
right
away
she
temporized
by
successively
unsheathing
the
two
knives
at
her
left
side
and
laying
them
beside
the
dart
gun
then
she
stopped
and
her
look
told
me
plainly
that
it
was
up
to
me
now
i
am
a
bugger
who
believes
in
carrying
perfect
otherwise
i
know
for
a
fact
you
go
and
end
up
by
weighing
yourself
down
with
dozens
literally
so
i
am
naturally
very
reluctant
to
get
out
of
touch
in
any
way
with
mother
who
is
a
little
rusty
along
the
sides
but
made
of
the
toughest
and
most
sharpenable
alloy
steel
i
ever
run
across
still
i
was
most
curious
to
find
out
what
she
do
about
that
hook
so
i
finally
laid
mother
on
the
concrete
beside
the
and
rested
my
hands
lightly
on
my
hips
all
ready
to
enjoy
myself
at
least
i
hoped
i
gave
that
impression
she
smiled
it
was
almost
a
nice
smile
by
now
we
let
our
scarves
drop
since
we
were
raising
any
more
dust
and
then
she
took
hold
of
the
hook
with
her
left
hand
and
started
to
unscrew
it
from
the
base
fitting
over
her
stump
of
course
i
told
myself
and
her
second
knife
the
one
without
a
grip
must
be
that
way
so
she
could
screw
its
tang
into
the
base
when
she
wanted
a
knife
on
her
right
hand
instead
of
a
hook
i
ought
to
have
guessed
i
grinned
my
admiration
of
her
mechanical
ingenuity
and
immediately
unhitched
my
knapsack
and
laid
it
beside
my
weapons
then
a
thought
occurred
to
me
i
opened
the
knapsack
and
moving
my
hand
slowly
and
very
openly
so
she
have
no
reason
to
suspect
a
ruse
i
drew
out
a
blanket
and
trying
to
show
her
both
sides
of
it
in
the
process
as
if
i
were
performing
some
damned
conjuring
trick
dropped
it
gently
on
the
ground
between
us
she
unsnapped
the
straps
on
her
satchel
that
fastened
it
to
her
belt
and
laid
it
aside
and
then
she
took
off
her
belt
too
slowly
drawing
it
through
the
wide
loops
of
weathered
denim
then
she
looked
meaningfully
at
my
belt
i
had
to
agree
with
her
belts
especially
ones
like
ours
can
be
nasty
weapons
i
removed
mine
simultaneously
each
belt
joined
its
corresponding
pile
of
weapons
and
other
belongings
she
shook
her
head
not
in
any
sort
of
negation
and
ran
her
fingers
into
the
black
hair
at
several
points
to
show
me
it
hid
no
weapon
then
looked
at
me
questioningly
i
nodded
that
i
was
satisfied
i
had
seen
anything
run
out
of
it
by
the
way
then
she
looked
up
at
my
black
skullcap
and
she
raised
her
eyebrows
and
smiled
again
this
time
with
a
spice
of
mocking
anticipation
in
some
ways
i
hate
to
part
with
that
headpiece
more
than
i
do
with
mother
not
really
because
of
its
sandwiched
inner
lining
if
the
rays
have
baked
my
brain
yet
they
never
will
and
i
sure
that
the
patches
of
lead
mesh
sewed
into
my
pants
over
my
loins
give
a
lot
more
practical
protection
but
i
was
getting
real
attracted
to
this
girl
by
now
and
there
are
times
when
a
person
must
make
a
sacrifice
of
his
vanity
i
whipped
off
my
stylish
black
felt
and
tossed
it
on
my
pile
and
dared
her
to
laugh
at
my
shiny
egg
top
strangely
she
did
even
smile
she
parted
her
lips
and
ran
her
tongue
along
the
upper
one
i
gave
an
eager
grin
in
reply
an
incautiously
wide
one
and
she
saw
my
plates
flash
my
plates
are
something
rather
special
though
they
are
by
no
means
unique
back
toward
the
end
of
the
last
war
when
it
was
obvious
to
any
realist
how
bad
things
were
going
to
be
though
not
how
strangely
terrible
a
number
of
people
like
myself
had
all
their
teeth
jerked
and
replaced
with
durable
plates
i
went
some
of
them
one
better
my
plates
were
stainless
steel
biting
and
chewing
ridges
smooth
continuous
ones
that
did
attempt
to
copy
individual
teeth
a
person
who
looks
closely
at
a
slab
of
chewing
tobacco
say
i
offer
him
will
be
puzzled
by
the
smoothly
curved
incision
made
as
if
by
a
razor
blade
mounted
on
the
arm
of
a
compass
magnetic
powder
buried
in
my
gums
makes
for
a
real
nice
fit
this
sacrifice
was
worse
than
my
hat
and
mother
combined
but
i
could
see
the
girl
expected
me
to
make
it
and
would
take
no
substitutes
and
in
this
attitude
i
had
to
admit
that
she
showed
very
sound
judgment
because
i
keep
the
incisor
parts
of
those
plates
filed
to
razor
sharpness
i
have
to
be
careful
about
my
tongue
and
lips
but
i
figure
it
worth
it
with
my
dental
scimitars
i
can
in
a
wink
bite
out
a
chunk
of
throat
and
windpipe
or
jugular
though
i
never
had
occasion
to
do
so
yet
for
the
first
minute
it
made
me
feel
like
an
old
man
a
real
dodderer
but
by
now
the
attraction
this
girl
had
for
me
was
getting
irrational
i
carefully
laid
the
two
plates
on
top
of
my
knapsack
in
return
as
a
sort
of
reward
you
might
say
she
opened
her
mouth
wide
and
showed
me
what
was
left
of
her
own
teeth
about
of
them
a
patchwork
of
tartar
and
gold
we
took
off
our
boots
pants
and
shirts
she
watching
very
suspiciously
i
knew
she
been
skeptical
of
my
carrying
only
one
knife
oddly
perhaps
considering
how
touchy
i
am
about
my
baldness
i
felt
no
sensitivity
about
revealing
the
lack
of
hair
on
my
chest
and
in
fact
a
sort
of
pride
in
displaying
the
slanting
radiation
scars
that
have
replaced
it
though
they
are
crawling
keloids
of
the
ugliest
bumpiest
sort
i
guess
to
me
such
scars
are
tribal
insignia
and
tribes
of
course
no
question
but
that
the
scar
on
the
forehead
had
been
the
first
focus
of
my
desire
for
her
and
it
still
added
to
my
interest
by
now
we
were
staying
as
perfectly
on
guard
or
watching
each
clothing
for
concealed
weapons
as
carefully
as
we
should
i
know
i
was
it
was
getting
dark
fast
there
was
much
time
left
and
the
other
interest
was
simply
becoming
too
great
we
were
still
automatically
careful
about
how
we
did
things
for
instance
the
way
we
took
off
our
pants
was
like
ballet
simultaneously
crouching
a
little
on
the
left
foot
and
whipping
the
right
leg
out
of
its
sheath
in
one
movement
all
ready
to
jump
without
tripping
ourselves
if
the
other
person
did
anything
funny
and
then
skinning
down
the
left
with
a
movement
almost
as
swift
but
as
i
say
it
was
getting
too
late
for
perfect
watchfulness
in
fact
for
any
kind
of
effective
watchfulness
at
all
the
complexion
of
the
whole
situation
was
changing
in
a
rush
the
possibilities
of
dealing
or
receiving
death
along
with
the
chance
of
the
minor
indignity
of
cannibalism
which
some
of
us
practice
were
suddenly
gone
all
gone
it
was
going
to
be
all
right
this
time
i
was
telling
myself
this
was
the
time
it
would
be
different
this
was
the
time
love
would
last
this
was
the
time
lust
would
be
the
firm
foundation
for
understanding
and
trust
this
time
there
would
be
really
safe
sleeping
this
girl
body
would
be
home
for
me
a
beautiful
tender
inexhaustibly
exciting
home
and
mine
for
her
for
always
as
she
threw
off
her
shirt
the
last
darkly
red
light
showed
me
another
smooth
slantwise
scar
this
one
around
her
hips
like
a
narrow
girdle
that
has
slipped
down
a
little
on
one
side
chapter
most
foul
as
in
the
best
it
is
but
this
most
foul
strange
and
hamlet
when
i
woke
the
light
was
almost
full
amber
and
i
could
feel
no
flesh
against
mine
only
the
blanket
under
me
i
very
slowly
rolled
over
and
there
she
was
sitting
on
the
corner
of
the
blanket
not
two
feet
from
me
combing
her
long
black
hair
with
a
big
comb
screwed
into
the
cap
over
her
wrist
stump
she
put
on
her
pants
and
shirt
but
the
former
were
rolled
up
to
her
knees
and
the
latter
though
tucked
in
was
buttoned
she
was
looking
at
me
contemplating
me
you
might
say
quite
dreamily
but
with
a
faint
easy
smile
i
smiled
back
at
her
it
was
lovely
too
lovely
there
had
to
be
something
wrong
with
it
there
was
oh
nothing
big
just
a
solitary
trifle
nothing
worth
noticing
really
but
the
tiniest
solitary
things
can
sometimes
be
the
most
irritating
like
mosquito
when
i
first
rolled
over
she
been
combing
her
hair
straight
back
revealing
a
wedge
of
baldness
following
the
continuation
of
her
forehead
scar
deep
back
across
her
scalp
now
with
a
movement
that
was
swift
though
not
she
swept
the
mass
of
her
hair
forward
and
to
the
left
so
that
it
covered
the
bald
area
also
her
lips
straightened
out
i
was
hurt
she
should
have
hidden
her
bit
of
baldness
it
was
something
we
had
in
common
something
that
brought
us
closer
and
she
should
have
stopped
smiling
at
just
that
moment
did
she
realize
i
loved
that
blaze
on
her
scalp
just
as
much
as
any
other
part
of
her
that
she
no
longer
had
any
need
to
practice
vanity
in
front
of
me
did
she
realize
that
as
soon
as
she
stopped
smiling
her
contemplative
stare
became
an
insult
to
me
what
right
had
she
to
stare
critically
i
felt
sure
at
my
bald
head
what
right
had
she
to
know
about
the
ulcer
on
my
left
shin
that
was
a
piece
of
information
worth
a
man
life
in
a
fight
what
right
had
she
to
cover
up
anyways
while
i
was
still
naked
she
ought
to
have
waked
me
up
so
that
we
could
have
got
dressed
as
we
undressed
together
there
were
lots
of
things
wrong
with
her
manners
oh
i
know
that
if
i
been
able
to
think
calmly
maybe
if
i
just
had
some
breakfast
or
a
little
coffee
inside
me
or
even
if
there
been
some
hot
breakfast
to
eat
at
that
moment
i
have
recognized
my
irritation
for
the
irrational
surge
of
negative
feeling
that
it
was
even
without
breakfast
if
i
just
had
the
knowledge
that
there
was
a
reasonably
secure
day
ahead
of
me
in
which
there
be
an
opportunity
for
me
to
straighten
out
my
feelings
i
would
have
been
irked
or
at
least
being
irked
would
have
bothered
me
terribly
but
a
sense
of
security
is
an
even
rarer
commodity
in
the
deathlands
than
a
hot
breakfast
given
just
the
ghost
of
a
sense
of
security
some
hot
breakfast
i
have
told
myself
that
she
was
merely
being
amusingly
coquettish
about
her
bald
streak
and
her
hair
that
it
was
natural
for
a
woman
to
try
to
preserve
some
mystery
about
herself
in
front
of
the
man
she
beds
with
but
you
get
leery
of
any
kind
of
mystery
in
the
deathlands
it
makes
you
frightened
and
angry
like
it
does
an
animal
mystery
is
for
cultural
queers
strictly
the
only
way
for
two
people
to
get
along
together
in
the
deathlands
even
for
a
while
is
never
to
hide
anything
and
never
to
make
a
move
that
does
have
an
immediate
clear
explanation
you
talk
you
see
certainly
not
at
first
and
so
you
ca
explain
anything
most
explanations
are
just
lies
and
dreams
anyway
so
you
have
to
be
doubly
careful
and
explicit
about
everything
you
do
this
girl
was
being
either
right
now
on
top
of
her
other
gaucheries
she
was
unscrewing
the
comb
from
her
wrist
an
unfriendly
if
not
quite
a
hostile
act
as
anyone
must
admit
understand
please
i
was
any
of
these
negative
reactions
of
mine
any
more
than
she
was
showing
hers
except
for
her
stopping
smiling
in
fact
stopped
smiling
i
was
playing
the
game
to
the
hilt
but
inside
me
everything
was
stewed
up
and
the
other
urge
had
come
back
and
presently
it
would
begin
to
grow
again
that
the
trouble
you
know
with
sex
as
a
solution
to
the
problem
of
the
two
urges
it
fine
while
it
lasts
but
it
wears
itself
out
and
then
you
back
with
urge
number
one
and
you
have
nothing
left
to
balance
it
with
oh
i
would
kill
this
girl
today
i
probably
would
seriously
think
of
killing
her
for
a
month
or
more
but
old
urge
number
one
would
be
there
and
growing
mostly
under
cover
all
the
time
of
course
there
were
things
i
could
do
to
slow
its
growth
lots
of
little
gimmicks
in
fact
i
was
pretty
experienced
at
this
business
for
instance
i
could
take
a
shot
at
talking
to
her
pretty
soon
for
a
catchy
starter
i
could
tell
her
about
nowhere
how
these
five
other
buggers
and
me
found
ourselves
independently
skulking
along
after
this
scavenging
expedition
from
porter
how
we
naturally
joined
forces
in
that
situation
how
we
set
a
pitfall
for
their
jeep
and
wrecked
it
and
them
how
when
our
haul
turned
out
to
be
unexpectedly
big
the
four
of
us
left
from
the
kill
chummied
up
and
padded
down
together
and
amused
each
other
for
a
while
and
played
games
you
might
say
why
at
one
point
we
even
had
an
old
crank
phonograph
going
and
read
some
books
and
of
course
how
when
the
loot
gave
out
and
the
fun
wore
off
we
had
our
murder
party
and
i
survived
along
with
i
think
a
bugger
named
jerry
at
any
rate
he
was
gone
when
the
blood
stopped
spurting
and
i
had
no
stomach
for
tracking
him
though
i
probably
should
have
and
in
return
she
could
tell
me
how
she
had
killed
off
her
last
set
of
girlfriends
or
boyfriends
or
friend
or
whatever
it
was
after
that
we
could
have
a
go
at
exchanging
news
rumors
and
speculations
about
local
national
and
world
events
was
it
true
that
atlantic
highlands
had
planes
of
some
sort
or
were
they
from
europe
were
they
actually
crucifying
the
deathlanders
around
walla
walla
or
only
nailing
up
their
dead
bodies
as
dire
warnings
to
others
such
had
manteno
made
christianity
compulsory
yet
or
were
they
still
tolerating
zen
buddhists
was
it
true
that
los
alamos
had
been
completely
wiped
out
by
plague
but
the
area
taboo
to
deathlanders
because
of
the
robot
guards
they
left
behind
metal
guards
eight
feet
tall
who
tramped
across
the
white
sands
wailing
did
they
still
have
free
love
in
pacific
palisades
did
she
know
there
been
a
pitched
battle
fought
by
expeditionary
forces
from
ouachita
and
savannah
fortress
over
the
loot
of
birmingham
apparently
after
yellow
fever
had
finished
off
that
principality
had
she
rooted
out
any
observers
lately
some
of
the
civilized
communities
the
more
scientific
ones
try
to
maintain
a
few
weather
stations
and
the
like
in
the
deathlands
camouflaging
them
elaborately
and
manning
them
with
one
or
two
impudent
characters
to
whom
we
give
a
hard
time
if
we
uncover
them
had
she
heard
the
tale
that
was
going
around
that
south
america
and
the
french
riviera
had
survived
the
last
war
absolutely
untouched
and
the
obviously
ridiculous
rider
that
they
had
blue
skies
there
and
saw
stars
every
third
night
did
she
think
that
subsequent
conditions
were
showing
that
the
earth
actually
had
plunged
into
an
interstellar
dust
cloud
coincidentally
with
the
start
of
the
last
war
the
dust
cloud
used
as
a
cover
for
the
first
attacks
some
said
or
did
she
still
hold
with
the
majority
that
the
dust
was
solely
of
atomic
origin
with
a
little
help
from
volcanoes
and
dry
spells
how
many
green
sunsets
had
she
seen
in
the
last
year
after
we
chewed
over
those
racy
topics
and
some
more
like
them
and
incidentally
got
bored
with
guessing
and
fabricating
we
might
if
we
felt
especially
daring
and
conversation
were
going
particularly
well
even
take
a
chance
on
talking
a
little
about
our
childhoods
about
how
things
were
before
the
last
war
though
she
was
almost
too
young
for
that
about
the
things
we
remembered
the
big
things
were
much
too
dangerous
topics
to
venture
on
and
sometimes
even
the
little
memories
could
suddenly
twist
you
up
as
if
you
swallowed
lye
but
after
that
there
would
be
anything
left
to
talk
about
anything
you
risk
talking
about
that
is
for
instance
no
matter
how
long
we
talked
it
was
very
unlikely
that
we
either
of
us
tell
the
other
anything
complete
or
very
accurate
about
how
we
lived
from
day
to
day
about
our
techniques
of
surviving
and
staying
sane
or
at
least
functional
that
would
be
too
imprudent
it
would
go
too
much
against
the
grain
of
any
player
of
the
murder
game
would
i
tell
her
or
anyone
about
how
i
worked
the
ruses
of
playing
dead
and
disguising
myself
as
a
woman
about
my
trick
of
picking
a
path
just
before
dark
and
then
circling
back
to
it
by
a
route
about
the
chess
games
i
played
with
myself
about
the
bottle
of
green
terribly
powder
i
carried
to
sprinkle
behind
me
to
bluff
off
pursuers
a
fat
chance
of
my
revealing
things
like
that
and
when
all
the
talk
was
over
what
would
it
have
gained
us
our
minds
would
be
filled
with
a
lot
of
painful
stuff
better
kept
buried
meaningless
hopes
scraps
of
vicarious
living
in
cultured
communities
memories
that
were
nothing
but
melancholy
given
concrete
form
the
melancholy
is
easiest
to
bear
when
it
the
diffused
background
for
everything
and
all
garbage
is
best
kept
in
the
can
oh
yes
our
talking
would
have
gained
us
a
few
more
days
of
infatuation
of
phantom
security
but
those
we
could
have
almost
as
many
of
them
at
any
rate
without
talking
for
instance
things
were
smoothing
over
already
between
her
and
me
again
and
i
no
longer
felt
quite
so
irked
she
replaced
the
comb
with
an
pair
of
light
pliers
and
was
doing
up
her
hair
with
the
metal
shavings
and
i
was
acting
as
if
content
to
watch
her
as
in
a
way
i
was
i
still
made
no
move
to
get
dressed
she
looked
real
sweet
you
know
primping
herself
that
way
her
face
was
a
little
flat
but
it
was
young
and
the
scar
gave
it
just
the
fillip
it
needed
but
what
was
going
on
behind
that
forehead
right
now
i
asked
myself
i
felt
real
psychic
this
morning
my
mind
as
clear
as
a
bottle
of
white
rock
you
find
miraculously
unbroken
in
a
blasted
tavern
and
the
answers
to
the
question
i
asked
myself
came
effortlessly
she
was
telling
herself
she
got
herself
a
man
again
a
man
who
was
adequate
in
the
primal
clutch
i
gave
myself
that
pat
on
the
back
and
that
she
would
have
to
be
plagued
and
have
her
safety
endangered
by
kind
of
restlessness
and
yearning
for
a
while
she
was
lightly
playing
around
with
ideas
about
how
she
found
a
home
and
a
protector
knowing
she
was
kidding
herself
that
it
was
the
most
gimcracky
feminine
but
enjoying
it
just
the
same
she
was
sizing
me
up
deciding
in
detail
just
what
i
went
for
in
a
woman
what
whetted
my
interest
so
she
could
keep
that
roused
as
long
as
seemed
desirable
or
prudent
to
her
to
continue
our
relation
she
was
kicking
herself
only
lightly
to
begin
with
because
she
taken
any
precautions
because
we
who
escaped
hot
death
against
all
reasonable
expectations
by
virtue
of
some
incalculable
resistance
to
the
ills
of
radioactivity
quite
often
find
we
escaped
sterility
too
if
she
should
become
pregnant
she
was
telling
herself
then
she
had
a
real
sticky
business
ahead
of
her
where
no
man
could
be
trusted
for
a
second
and
because
she
was
thinking
of
this
and
because
she
was
obviously
a
realistic
deathlander
she
was
reminding
herself
that
a
woman
is
basically
less
impulsive
and
daring
and
resourceful
than
a
man
and
so
had
always
better
be
sure
she
gets
in
the
first
blow
she
would
be
thinking
that
i
was
a
realist
myself
and
a
smart
man
one
able
to
understand
her
predicament
quite
clearly
and
because
of
that
a
much
sooner
danger
to
her
she
was
feeling
old
number
one
urge
starting
to
grow
in
her
again
and
wondering
whether
it
might
be
wisest
to
give
it
the
treatment
that
is
the
trouble
with
a
clear
mind
for
a
little
while
you
see
things
as
they
really
are
and
you
can
accurately
predict
how
they
going
to
shape
the
future
and
then
suddenly
you
realize
you
predicted
yourself
a
week
or
a
month
into
the
future
and
you
ca
live
the
intervening
time
any
more
because
you
already
imagined
it
in
detail
people
who
live
in
communities
even
the
cultural
queers
of
our
maimed
era
are
much
bothered
by
it
there
must
be
some
sort
of
blinkers
they
hand
you
out
along
with
the
key
to
the
city
but
in
the
deathlands
it
a
fairly
common
phenomenon
and
there
no
hiding
from
it
me
and
my
clear
mind
once
again
it
had
done
me
out
of
days
of
fun
changed
a
love
affair
into
a
one
night
stand
oh
there
was
no
question
about
it
this
girl
and
i
were
finished
right
this
minute
as
of
now
because
she
was
just
as
psychic
as
i
was
this
morning
and
had
sensed
every
last
thing
that
i
been
thinking
with
a
movement
smooth
enough
not
to
look
rushed
i
swung
into
a
crouch
she
was
on
her
knees
faster
than
that
her
left
hand
hovering
over
the
little
set
of
tools
for
her
stump
which
like
any
good
mechanic
lined
up
neatly
on
the
edge
of
the
blanket
the
hook
the
comb
a
long
telescoping
fork
a
couple
of
other
items
and
the
knife
i
grabbed
a
handful
of
blanket
ready
to
jerk
it
from
under
her
she
seen
that
grabbed
it
our
gazes
dueled
there
was
a
whine
over
our
heads
quite
loud
from
the
start
though
it
sounded
as
if
it
were
very
deep
up
in
the
haze
it
swiftly
dropped
in
pitch
and
volume
the
top
of
the
skeletal
cracking
plant
across
the
freeway
glowed
with
elmo
fire
three
times
it
glowed
that
way
so
bright
we
could
see
the
flames
of
it
reaching
up
despite
the
full
amber
daylight
the
whine
died
away
but
in
the
last
moment
paradoxically
it
seemed
to
be
coming
closer
this
shared
threat
for
any
unexpected
event
is
a
threat
in
the
deathlands
and
a
mysterious
event
doubly
so
put
a
stop
to
our
murder
game
the
girl
and
i
were
buddies
again
buddies
to
be
relied
on
in
a
pinch
for
the
duration
of
the
threat
at
least
no
need
to
say
so
or
to
reassure
each
other
of
the
fact
in
any
way
it
was
taken
for
granted
besides
there
was
no
time
we
had
to
use
every
second
allowed
us
in
getting
ready
for
whatever
was
coming
first
i
grabbed
up
mother
then
i
relieved
myself
fear
made
it
easy
then
i
skinned
into
my
pants
and
boots
slapped
in
my
teeth
thrust
the
blanket
and
knapsack
into
the
shallow
cave
under
the
edge
of
the
freeway
looking
around
me
all
the
time
so
as
not
to
be
surprised
from
any
quarter
meanwhile
the
girl
had
put
on
her
boots
located
her
dart
gun
unscrewed
the
pliers
from
her
stump
put
the
knife
in
and
was
arranging
her
scarf
so
it
made
a
sling
for
the
maimed
arm
i
wondered
why
but
had
no
time
to
waste
guessing
even
if
i
wanted
to
for
at
that
moment
a
small
dull
silver
plane
more
than
anything
else
loomed
out
of
the
haze
beyond
the
cracking
plant
and
came
silently
drifting
down
toward
us
the
girl
thrust
her
satchel
into
the
cave
and
along
with
it
her
dart
gun
i
caught
her
idea
and
tucked
mother
into
my
pants
behind
my
back
i
thought
from
the
first
glimpse
of
it
that
the
plane
was
disabled
i
guess
it
was
its
silence
that
gave
me
the
idea
this
theory
was
confirmed
when
one
of
its
very
stubby
wings
or
vanes
touched
a
corner
pillar
of
the
cracking
plant
the
plane
was
moving
in
too
slow
a
glide
to
be
wrecked
in
fact
it
was
moving
in
a
slower
glide
than
i
would
have
believed
possible
but
then
it
many
years
since
i
have
seen
a
plane
in
flight
it
was
wrecked
but
the
little
collision
spun
it
around
twice
in
a
lazy
circle
and
it
landed
on
the
freeway
with
a
scuffing
noise
not
fifty
feet
from
us
you
could
exactly
say
it
had
crashed
in
but
it
stayed
at
an
odd
tilt
it
looked
crippled
all
right
an
oval
door
in
the
plane
opened
and
a
man
dropped
lightly
out
on
the
concrete
and
what
a
man
he
was
nearer
seven
feet
tall
than
six
blond
hair
face
and
hands
richly
tanned
the
rest
of
him
covered
by
trim
garments
of
a
gleaming
gray
he
must
have
weighed
as
much
as
the
two
of
us
together
but
he
was
beautifully
built
muscular
yet
his
face
looked
brightly
intelligent
and
and
kind
yes
kind
damn
him
it
was
enough
that
his
body
should
fairly
glow
with
a
health
and
vitality
that
was
an
insult
to
our
seared
skins
and
stringy
muscles
and
ulcers
and
stomachs
and
cancers
he
had
to
look
kind
too
the
sort
of
man
who
would
put
you
to
bed
and
take
care
of
you
as
if
you
were
some
sort
of
interesting
sick
fox
and
maybe
even
say
a
little
prayer
for
you
and
all
manner
of
other
abominations
i
do
think
i
could
have
endured
my
fury
standing
still
fortunately
there
was
no
need
to
as
if
we
rehearsed
the
whole
thing
for
hours
the
girl
and
i
scrambled
up
onto
the
freeway
and
scurried
toward
the
man
from
the
plane
cunningly
swinging
away
from
each
other
so
that
it
would
be
harder
for
him
to
watch
the
two
of
us
at
once
but
not
enough
to
make
it
obvious
that
we
attended
an
attack
from
two
quarters
we
did
run
though
we
covered
the
ground
as
fast
as
we
dared
running
would
have
been
too
much
of
a
too
and
the
pilot
which
was
how
i
named
him
to
myself
had
a
small
gun
in
his
right
hand
in
fact
the
way
we
moved
was
part
of
our
act
i
dragged
one
leg
as
if
it
were
crippled
and
the
girl
faked
another
sort
of
limp
one
that
made
her
approach
a
series
of
half
curtsies
her
arm
in
the
sling
was
all
twisted
but
at
the
same
time
she
was
accidently
showing
her
breasts
i
remember
thinking
wo
distract
this
breed
bull
that
way
sister
he
probably
has
a
harem
of
i
had
my
head
thrown
back
and
my
hands
stretched
out
supplicatingly
meanwhile
the
both
of
us
were
babbling
a
blue
streak
i
was
rapidly
croaking
something
like
mister
for
god
sake
save
my
pal
he
hurt
a
lot
i
am
not
a
hundred
yards
away
he
dyin
mister
he
dyin
o
thirst
his
tongue
all
swole
up
oh
save
him
mister
save
my
pal
he
not
a
hundred
yards
away
he
dyin
mister
dyin
and
she
was
singsonging
an
even
worse
rigamarole
about
how
they
were
after
us
from
porter
and
going
to
crucify
us
because
we
believed
in
science
and
how
already
impaled
her
mother
and
her
sister
and
a
lot
more
of
the
same
it
did
matter
that
our
stories
did
fit
or
make
sense
the
babble
had
a
convincing
tone
and
getting
us
closer
to
this
guy
which
was
all
that
counted
he
pointed
his
gun
at
me
and
then
i
could
see
him
hesitate
and
i
thought
exultingly
a
lot
of
healthy
meat
you
got
there
mister
but
it
tame
meat
mister
tame
he
compromised
by
taking
a
step
back
and
sort
of
hooting
at
us
and
waving
us
off
with
his
left
hand
as
if
we
were
a
couple
of
stray
dogs
it
was
greatly
to
our
advantage
that
we
acted
without
hesitation
and
i
do
think
we
have
been
able
to
do
that
except
that
we
been
all
set
to
kill
each
other
when
he
dropped
in
our
muscles
and
nerves
and
minds
were
keyed
for
instant
ruthless
attack
and
some
civilized
people
still
say
that
the
urge
to
murder
does
contribute
to
we
were
almost
close
enough
now
and
he
was
steeling
himself
to
shoot
and
i
remember
wondering
for
a
split
second
what
his
damn
gun
did
to
you
and
then
me
and
the
girl
had
started
the
alternation
routine
i
stop
dead
as
if
completely
cowed
by
the
threat
of
his
weapon
and
as
he
took
note
of
it
she
go
in
a
little
further
and
as
his
gaze
shifted
to
her
she
stop
dead
and
i
go
in
another
foot
and
then
try
to
make
my
halt
even
more
convincing
as
his
gaze
darted
back
to
me
we
worked
it
perfectly
our
rhythm
was
beautiful
as
if
we
were
old
dancing
partners
though
the
whole
thing
was
absolutely
impromptu
still
i
honestly
do
think
we
ever
have
got
to
him
if
it
been
for
the
distraction
that
came
just
then
to
help
us
i
could
tell
you
see
that
he
finally
steeled
himself
and
we
still
were
quite
close
enough
he
was
as
tame
as
i
hoped
i
reached
behind
me
for
mother
determined
to
do
a
rush
and
leap
anyway
when
there
came
this
sick
scream
i
do
know
how
else
to
describe
it
briefly
it
was
a
scream
feminine
for
choice
it
came
from
some
distance
and
the
direction
of
the
old
cracking
plant
it
had
a
note
of
anguish
and
warning
yet
at
the
same
time
it
was
weak
and
almost
faltering
you
might
say
and
squeaky
at
the
end
as
if
it
came
from
a
person
half
dead
and
a
throat
choked
with
phlegm
it
had
all
those
qualities
or
a
wonderful
mimicking
of
them
and
it
had
quite
an
effect
on
our
boy
in
gray
for
in
the
act
of
shooting
me
down
he
started
to
turn
and
look
over
his
shoulder
oh
it
did
altogether
stop
him
from
shooting
me
he
got
me
partly
covered
again
as
i
was
in
the
middle
of
my
lunge
i
found
out
what
his
gun
did
to
you
my
right
arm
which
was
the
part
he
covered
just
went
dead
and
i
finished
my
lunge
slamming
up
against
his
iron
knees
like
a
highschool
kid
trying
to
block
out
a
pro
footballer
with
the
knife
slipping
uselessly
away
from
my
fingers
but
in
the
blessed
meanwhile
the
girl
had
lunged
too
not
with
a
slow
slash
thank
god
but
with
a
high
slicing
thrust
aimed
for
a
point
just
under
his
ear
she
connected
and
a
fan
of
blood
sprayed
her
full
in
the
face
i
grabbed
my
knife
with
my
left
hand
as
it
fell
scrambled
to
my
feet
and
drove
the
knife
at
his
throat
in
a
swing
that
happened
to
come
handiest
at
the
time
the
point
went
through
his
flesh
like
nothing
and
jarred
against
his
spine
with
a
violence
that
i
hoped
would
shock
into
nervous
insensibility
the
stoutest
medulla
oblongata
and
prevent
any
dying
reprisals
on
his
part
i
got
my
wish
in
large
part
he
swayed
straightened
dropped
his
gun
and
fell
flat
on
his
back
giving
his
skull
a
murderous
crack
on
the
concrete
for
good
measure
he
lay
there
and
after
a
half
dozen
gushes
the
bright
blood
quit
pumping
strongly
out
of
his
neck
then
came
the
part
that
was
like
a
dying
reprisal
though
obviously
not
being
directed
by
him
as
of
now
and
come
to
think
of
it
it
may
have
had
its
good
points
the
girl
who
was
clearly
a
most
cuss
snatched
for
his
gun
where
he
dropped
it
to
make
sure
she
got
it
ahead
of
me
she
snatched
yes
and
then
jerked
back
letting
off
a
sizable
squeal
of
pain
anger
and
surprise
where
we
seen
his
gun
hit
the
concrete
there
was
now
a
tiny
incandescent
puddle
a
rill
of
blood
snaked
out
from
the
pool
around
his
head
and
touched
the
whitely
glowing
puddle
and
a
jet
of
steam
sizzled
up
somehow
the
gun
had
managed
to
melt
itself
in
the
moment
of
its
owner
dying
well
at
any
rate
that
showed
it
had
contained
any
gunpowder
or
ordinary
chemical
explosives
though
i
already
knew
it
operated
on
other
principles
from
the
way
it
had
been
used
to
paralyze
me
more
to
the
point
it
showed
that
the
gun
owner
was
the
member
of
a
culture
that
believed
in
taking
very
complete
precautions
against
its
gadgets
falling
into
the
hands
of
strangers
but
the
gun
fusing
was
quite
all
as
the
girl
and
me
shifted
our
gaze
from
the
puddle
which
was
cooling
fast
and
now
glowed
red
like
the
blood
as
we
shifted
our
gaze
back
from
the
puddle
to
the
dead
man
we
saw
that
at
three
points
points
over
where
you
expect
pockets
to
be
his
gray
clothing
had
charred
in
small
irregularly
shaped
patches
from
which
threads
of
black
smoke
were
twisting
upward
just
at
that
moment
so
close
as
to
make
me
jump
in
spite
of
years
of
learning
to
absorb
shocks
stoically
right
at
my
elbow
it
seemed
to
the
girl
jumped
too
i
may
say
a
voice
said
done
a
murder
hey
advancing
briskly
around
the
skewily
grounded
plane
from
the
direction
of
the
cracking
plant
was
an
old
geezer
a
seasoned
deathlander
if
i
ever
saw
one
he
had
a
shock
of
hair
the
rest
of
him
that
showed
from
his
weathered
gray
clothing
looked
fried
by
the
sun
rays
and
others
to
a
stringy
crisp
and
strapped
to
his
boots
and
weighing
down
his
belt
were
a
good
dozen
knives
not
satisfied
with
the
unnerving
noise
he
made
already
he
went
on
brightly
neat
job
too
i
give
you
credit
for
that
but
why
the
hell
did
you
have
to
set
the
guy
afire
chapter
are
always
thanks
to
our
human
nature
potential
criminals
none
of
us
stands
outside
humanity
black
collective
the
undiscovered
self
carl
ordinarily
scroungers
who
hide
around
on
the
outskirts
until
the
killing
done
and
then
come
in
to
share
the
loot
get
what
they
deserve
wordless
orders
well
backed
up
to
be
on
their
way
at
once
sometimes
they
even
catch
an
of
the
murder
urge
if
it
all
been
expended
on
the
first
victim
or
victims
yet
they
do
it
trusting
i
suppose
to
the
irresistible
glamor
of
their
personalities
there
were
several
reasons
why
we
did
at
once
give
pop
this
treatment
in
the
first
place
we
did
neither
of
us
have
our
distance
weapons
my
revolver
and
her
dart
gun
were
both
tucked
in
the
cave
back
at
the
edge
of
the
freeway
and
there
one
bad
thing
about
a
bugger
so
he
lugs
them
around
by
the
carload
he
generally
good
at
tossing
them
with
his
dozen
or
so
knives
pop
definitely
outgunned
us
second
we
were
both
of
us
without
the
use
of
an
arm
that
right
the
both
of
us
my
right
arm
still
dangled
like
a
string
of
sausages
and
i
could
yet
feel
any
signs
of
it
coming
undead
while
she
burned
her
fingers
badly
grabbing
at
the
gun
i
could
see
their
tips
now
as
she
pulled
them
out
of
her
mouth
for
a
second
to
wipe
the
blood
out
of
her
eyes
all
she
had
was
her
stump
with
the
knife
screwed
to
it
me
i
can
throw
a
knife
if
i
have
to
but
you
bet
i
was
going
to
risk
mother
that
way
then
i
no
sooner
heard
pop
voice
breathy
and
a
little
high
like
an
old
man
will
get
than
it
occurred
to
me
that
he
must
have
been
the
one
who
had
given
the
funny
scream
that
had
distracted
the
attention
and
let
us
get
him
which
incidentally
made
pop
a
quick
thinker
and
imaginative
to
boot
and
meant
that
he
helped
on
the
killing
besides
all
that
pop
did
not
come
in
fawning
and
full
of
extravagant
praise
as
most
scroungers
will
he
just
assumed
equality
with
us
right
from
the
start
and
he
talked
in
an
absolutely
way
neither
praising
nor
criticizing
one
bit
too
damn
and
open
for
that
matter
to
suit
my
taste
but
then
i
have
heard
other
buggers
say
that
some
old
men
are
apt
to
get
talkative
though
i
had
never
worked
with
or
run
into
one
myself
old
people
are
very
rare
in
the
deathlands
as
you
might
imagine
so
the
girl
and
me
just
scowled
at
him
but
did
nothing
to
stop
him
as
he
came
along
near
us
his
extra
knives
would
be
no
advantage
to
him
hum
he
said
looks
a
lot
like
a
guy
i
murdered
five
years
back
down
los
alamos
way
same
silver
monkey
suit
and
almost
as
tall
nice
chap
too
was
trying
to
give
me
something
for
a
fever
i
faked
that
his
gun
melted
my
man
did
smoke
after
i
gave
him
his
quietus
but
then
it
turned
out
he
did
have
any
metal
on
him
i
wonder
if
this
chap
he
started
to
kneel
down
by
the
body
hands
off
pop
i
gritted
at
him
that
was
how
we
started
calling
him
pop
why
sure
sure
he
said
staying
there
on
one
knee
i
wo
lay
a
finger
on
him
it
just
that
i
heard
the
alamosers
have
it
rigged
so
that
any
metal
they
carrying
melts
when
they
die
and
i
was
wondering
about
this
boy
but
he
all
yours
friend
by
the
way
what
your
name
friend
ray
i
snarled
ray
baker
i
think
the
main
reason
i
told
him
was
that
i
did
want
him
calling
me
friend
again
you
talk
too
much
pop
i
suppose
i
do
ray
he
agreed
what
your
name
lady
the
girl
just
sort
of
hissed
at
him
and
he
grinned
at
me
as
if
to
say
oh
women
then
he
said
why
do
you
go
through
his
pockets
ray
i
real
curious
shut
up
i
said
but
i
felt
that
he
put
me
on
the
spot
just
the
same
i
was
curious
about
the
guy
pockets
myself
of
course
but
i
was
also
wondering
if
pop
was
alone
or
if
he
had
somebody
with
him
and
whether
there
was
anybody
else
in
the
plane
or
not
things
like
that
too
many
things
at
the
same
time
i
did
want
to
let
on
to
pop
how
useless
my
right
arm
was
if
i
just
get
a
twinge
of
feeling
in
that
arm
i
knew
i
feel
a
lot
more
confident
fast
i
knelt
down
across
the
body
from
him
started
to
lay
mother
aside
and
then
hesitated
the
girl
gave
me
an
encouraging
look
as
if
to
say
i
take
care
of
the
old
geezer
on
the
strength
of
her
look
i
put
down
mother
and
started
to
pry
open
the
pilot
left
hand
which
was
clenched
in
a
fist
that
looked
a
mite
too
big
to
have
nothing
inside
it
the
girl
started
to
edge
behind
pop
but
he
caught
the
movement
right
away
and
looked
at
her
with
a
grin
that
was
so
knowing
and
yet
so
friendly
and
yet
so
pitying
at
the
same
time
with
the
pity
of
the
old
pro
for
even
the
seasoned
amateur
that
in
her
place
i
think
i
have
blushed
myself
as
she
did
now
through
the
streaks
of
the
blood
you
do
have
to
worry
none
about
me
lady
he
said
running
a
hand
through
his
white
hair
and
incidentally
touching
the
pommel
of
one
of
the
two
knives
strapped
high
on
the
back
of
his
jacket
so
he
could
reach
one
over
either
shoulder
i
quit
murdering
some
years
back
it
got
to
be
too
much
of
a
strain
on
my
nerves
oh
yeah
i
could
help
saying
as
i
pried
up
the
pilot
index
finger
and
started
on
the
next
then
why
the
pop
oh
you
mean
those
he
said
glancing
down
at
his
knives
well
the
fact
is
ray
i
carry
them
to
impress
buggers
dumber
than
you
and
the
lady
here
anybody
wants
to
think
i
still
a
practicing
murderer
i
got
no
objections
matter
of
sentiment
too
i
just
hate
to
part
with
them
they
bring
back
important
memories
and
then
you
wo
believe
this
ray
but
i
going
to
tell
you
just
the
same
guys
just
up
and
give
me
their
knives
and
i
doubly
hate
to
part
with
a
gift
i
was
going
to
say
oh
yeah
again
or
shut
up
either
though
i
certainly
wished
i
could
turn
off
pop
spigot
or
thought
i
did
then
i
felt
a
painful
tingling
shoot
down
my
right
arm
i
smiled
at
pop
and
said
any
other
reasons
yep
he
said
got
to
shave
and
i
might
as
well
do
it
in
style
a
new
blade
every
day
in
the
fortnight
is
twice
as
good
as
the
old
ads
you
know
it
makes
you
keep
a
knife
in
fine
shape
if
you
shave
with
it
what
you
got
there
ray
you
were
wrong
pop
i
said
he
did
have
some
metal
on
him
that
did
melt
i
held
up
for
them
to
see
the
object
i
extracted
from
his
left
fist
a
bright
steel
cube
measuring
about
an
inch
across
each
side
but
it
felt
lighter
than
if
it
were
solid
metal
five
of
the
faces
looked
absolutely
bare
the
sixth
had
a
round
button
recessed
in
it
from
the
way
they
looked
at
it
neither
pop
nor
the
girl
had
the
faintest
idea
of
what
it
was
i
certainly
had
had
he
pushed
the
button
the
girl
asked
her
voice
was
throaty
but
unexpectedly
refined
as
if
she
done
no
talking
at
all
not
even
to
herself
since
coming
to
the
deathlands
and
so
retained
the
cultured
intonations
she
had
earlier
whenever
and
wherever
that
had
been
it
gave
me
a
funny
feeling
of
course
because
they
were
the
first
words
i
heard
her
speak
not
from
the
way
he
was
holding
it
i
told
her
the
button
was
pointed
up
toward
his
thumb
but
the
thumb
was
on
the
outside
of
his
fingers
i
felt
an
unexpected
satisfaction
at
having
expressed
myself
so
clearly
and
i
told
myself
not
to
get
childish
the
girl
slitted
her
eyes
do
you
push
it
ray
she
said
think
i
nuts
i
told
her
meanwhile
sliding
the
cube
into
the
smaller
pocket
of
my
pants
where
it
fit
tight
and
would
turn
sideways
and
the
button
maybe
get
pressed
by
accident
the
tingling
in
my
right
arm
was
almost
unbearable
now
but
i
was
getting
control
over
the
muscles
again
pushing
that
button
i
added
might
melt
what
left
of
the
plane
or
blow
us
all
up
it
never
hurts
to
emphasize
that
you
may
have
another
weapon
in
your
possession
even
if
it
just
a
suicide
bomb
there
was
a
man
pushed
another
button
once
pop
said
softly
and
reflectively
his
gaze
went
far
out
over
the
deathlands
and
took
in
a
good
half
of
the
horizon
and
he
slowly
shook
his
head
then
his
face
brightened
did
you
know
ray
he
said
that
i
actually
met
that
man
long
afterwards
you
do
believe
me
i
know
but
i
actually
did
tell
you
about
it
some
other
time
i
almost
said
thanks
pop
for
sparing
me
at
least
for
a
while
but
i
was
afraid
that
would
set
him
off
again
besides
it
would
have
been
quite
true
i
heard
other
buggers
tell
the
yarn
of
how
they
met
and
invariably
rubbed
out
the
actual
guy
who
pushed
the
button
or
buttons
that
set
the
fusion
missiles
blasting
toward
their
targets
but
i
felt
a
sudden
curiosity
as
to
what
pop
version
of
the
yarn
would
be
oh
well
i
could
ask
him
some
other
time
if
we
both
lived
that
long
i
started
to
check
the
pilot
pockets
my
right
hand
could
help
a
little
now
those
look
like
mean
burns
you
got
there
lady
i
heard
pop
tell
the
girl
he
was
right
there
were
blisters
easy
to
see
on
three
of
the
fingertips
i
got
some
salve
that
pretty
good
he
went
on
and
some
clean
cloth
i
could
put
on
a
bandage
for
you
if
you
wanted
if
your
hand
started
to
feel
poisoned
you
could
always
tell
ray
here
to
slip
a
knife
in
me
pop
was
a
cute
gasser
you
had
to
admit
i
reminded
myself
that
it
was
pop
business
to
play
up
to
the
both
of
us
charm
being
the
secret
weapon
of
all
scroungers
the
girl
gave
a
harsh
little
laugh
very
well
she
said
but
we
will
use
my
salve
i
know
it
works
for
me
and
she
started
to
lead
pop
to
where
we
hidden
our
things
i
go
with
you
i
told
them
standing
up
it
did
look
like
we
were
going
to
have
any
more
murders
today
pop
had
got
through
the
preliminary
ingratiations
pretty
well
and
the
girl
and
me
had
had
our
catharsis
but
that
would
be
no
excuse
for
any
such
stupidity
as
letting
the
two
of
them
get
near
my
strolling
to
the
cave
and
back
i
eased
the
situation
a
bit
more
by
saying
that
scream
you
let
off
pop
really
helped
i
do
know
what
gave
you
the
idea
but
thanks
oh
that
he
said
forget
about
it
i
wo
i
told
him
you
may
say
you
quit
killing
but
helped
on
a
today
ray
he
said
a
little
solemnly
if
it
make
you
feel
any
happier
i
take
a
bit
of
the
responsibility
for
every
murder
that
been
done
since
the
beginning
of
time
i
looked
at
him
for
a
while
then
pop
you
not
by
any
chance
the
religious
type
i
asked
suddenly
lord
no
he
told
us
that
struck
me
as
a
satisfactory
answer
god
preserve
me
from
the
religious
type
we
have
quite
a
few
of
those
in
the
deathlands
it
generally
means
that
they
try
to
convert
you
to
something
before
they
kill
you
or
sometimes
afterwards
we
completed
our
errands
i
felt
a
lot
more
secure
with
old
friend
strapped
to
my
middle
mother
is
wonderful
but
she
is
not
enough
i
dawdled
over
inspecting
the
pilot
pockets
partly
to
give
my
right
hand
time
to
come
back
all
the
way
and
to
tell
the
truth
i
did
much
enjoy
the
job
a
corpse
especially
such
a
handsome
cadaver
as
this
just
did
go
with
pop
brand
of
light
patter
pop
did
up
the
girl
hand
in
high
style
bandaging
each
finger
separately
and
then
persuading
her
to
put
on
a
big
work
glove
he
took
out
of
his
small
pack
lost
the
right
he
explained
which
was
the
only
one
i
ever
used
anyway
never
knew
until
now
why
i
kept
this
how
does
it
feel
alice
i
might
have
known
he
worm
her
name
out
of
her
it
occurred
to
me
that
pop
ideas
of
scrounging
might
extend
to
alice
favors
the
urge
does
die
out
when
you
get
old
they
tell
me
not
completely
he
also
helped
her
replace
the
knife
on
her
stump
with
the
hook
by
that
time
i
poked
into
all
the
pilot
pockets
i
could
get
at
without
stripping
him
and
found
nothing
but
three
irregularly
shaped
blobs
of
metal
still
hot
to
the
touch
under
the
charred
spots
of
course
i
did
want
the
job
of
stripping
him
somebody
else
could
do
a
little
work
i
told
myself
i
been
bothered
by
bodies
before
as
who
has
i
suppose
but
this
one
was
really
beginning
to
make
me
sick
maybe
i
was
cracking
up
it
occurred
to
me
murder
is
a
very
wearing
business
as
all
deathlanders
know
and
although
some
crack
earlier
than
others
all
crack
in
the
end
i
must
have
been
showing
how
i
was
feeling
because
cheer
up
ray
pop
said
you
and
alice
have
done
a
big
murder
i
say
the
subject
was
six
foot
ten
so
you
ought
to
be
happy
you
drawn
a
blank
on
his
pockets
but
there
still
the
plane
yeah
that
right
i
said
brightening
a
little
there
still
the
stuff
in
the
plane
i
knew
there
were
some
items
i
could
hope
for
like
shells
but
there
be
food
and
other
things
pop
corrected
me
i
said
you
may
have
thought
it
wrecked
but
i
do
have
you
taken
a
real
gander
at
it
worth
doing
believe
me
i
jumped
up
my
heart
was
suddenly
pounding
i
was
glad
of
an
excuse
to
get
away
from
the
body
but
there
was
a
lot
more
in
my
feelings
than
that
i
was
filled
with
an
excitement
to
which
i
did
want
to
give
a
name
because
it
would
make
the
too
great
one
of
the
wide
stubby
wings
of
the
plane
raking
downward
so
that
its
tip
almost
touched
the
concrete
had
hidden
the
undercarriage
of
the
fuselage
from
our
view
now
coming
around
the
wing
i
saw
that
was
no
i
had
to
drop
to
my
hands
and
knees
and
scan
around
with
my
cheek
next
to
the
concrete
before
i
believe
it
wrecked
plane
was
at
all
points
at
least
six
inches
off
the
i
got
to
my
feet
again
i
was
shaking
i
wanted
to
talk
but
i
could
i
grabbed
the
leading
edge
of
the
wing
to
stop
from
falling
the
whole
body
of
the
plane
gave
a
fraction
of
an
inch
and
then
resisted
my
leaning
weight
with
lazy
power
just
like
a
gyroscope
antigravity
i
croaked
though
you
could
have
heard
me
two
feet
then
my
voice
came
back
pop
alice
they
got
antigravity
antigravity
and
it
working
alice
had
just
come
around
the
wing
and
was
facing
me
she
was
shaking
too
and
her
face
was
white
like
i
knew
mine
was
pop
was
politely
standing
off
a
little
to
one
side
watching
us
curiously
told
you
you
won
a
real
prize
he
said
in
his
way
alice
wet
her
lips
ray
she
said
we
can
get
away
just
those
four
words
but
they
did
it
something
in
me
unlocked
no
exploded
describes
it
better
we
can
go
places
i
almost
shouted
beyond
the
dust
she
said
mexico
city
south
america
she
was
forgetting
the
deathlander
cynical
article
of
belief
that
the
dust
never
ends
but
then
so
was
i
it
makes
a
difference
whether
or
not
you
got
a
means
of
doing
something
rio
i
topped
her
with
the
indies
hong
kong
bombay
egypt
bermuda
the
french
riviera
bullfights
and
clean
beds
she
burst
out
with
restaurants
swimming
pools
bathrooms
skindiving
i
took
it
up
with
as
hysterical
as
she
was
road
races
and
roulette
tables
bentleys
and
porsches
aircoups
and
and
comets
martinis
and
hashish
and
ice
cream
sodas
hot
food
fresh
coffee
gambling
smoking
dancing
music
drinks
i
was
going
to
add
but
then
i
thought
of
how
little
alice
would
look
beside
the
dream
creatures
i
had
in
mind
i
tactfully
suppressed
the
word
but
i
filed
the
idea
away
i
do
think
either
of
us
knew
exactly
what
we
were
saying
alice
in
particular
i
do
believe
was
old
enough
to
have
experienced
almost
any
of
the
things
the
words
referred
to
they
were
mysterious
symbols
of
delights
spewing
out
of
us
ray
alice
said
hurrying
to
me
let
get
aboard
yes
i
said
eagerly
and
then
i
saw
a
little
problem
the
door
to
the
plane
was
a
couple
of
feet
above
our
heads
whoever
hoisted
himself
up
first
or
got
hoisted
up
as
would
have
to
be
the
case
with
alice
on
account
of
her
hand
would
be
momentarily
at
the
other
mercy
i
guess
it
occurred
to
alice
too
because
she
stopped
and
looked
at
me
it
was
a
little
like
the
old
teaser
about
the
fox
the
goose
and
the
corn
maybe
too
we
were
both
a
little
scared
the
plane
was
pop
solved
the
problem
in
the
direct
way
i
might
have
expected
of
him
by
stepping
quietly
between
us
giving
a
light
leap
catching
hold
of
the
curving
sill
chinning
himself
on
it
and
scrambling
up
into
the
plane
so
quickly
that
we
hardly
have
had
time
to
do
anything
about
it
if
we
wanted
to
pop
could
be
much
more
than
a
bantamweight
even
with
all
his
knives
the
plane
sagged
an
inch
and
then
swung
up
again
as
pop
disappeared
from
view
i
backed
off
reaching
for
my
but
a
moment
later
he
stuck
out
his
head
and
grinned
down
at
us
resting
his
elbows
on
the
sill
come
on
up
he
said
it
quite
a
place
i
promise
not
to
push
any
buttons
you
get
here
though
there
whole
regiments
of
them
i
grinned
back
at
pop
and
gave
alice
a
boost
up
she
did
like
it
but
she
could
see
it
had
to
be
her
next
she
hooked
onto
the
sill
and
pop
caught
hold
of
her
left
wrist
below
the
big
glove
and
heaved
then
it
was
my
turn
i
did
like
it
i
did
like
the
idea
of
those
two
buggers
poised
above
me
while
my
hands
were
helpless
on
the
sill
but
i
thought
a
nut
you
can
trust
a
nut
at
least
a
little
ways
though
you
ca
trust
nobody
i
heaved
myself
up
it
was
strange
to
feel
the
plane
giving
and
then
bracing
itself
like
something
alive
it
seemed
to
have
no
trouble
accepting
our
combined
weight
which
after
all
was
hardly
more
than
half
again
the
pilot
inside
the
cabin
was
pretty
small
but
as
pop
had
implied
oh
my
everything
looked
soft
and
smoothly
curved
like
you
imagine
your
insides
being
and
almost
everything
was
a
restfully
dull
silver
the
general
shape
of
it
was
something
like
the
inside
of
an
egg
forward
which
was
the
larger
end
were
a
couple
of
screens
and
a
wide
viewport
and
some
small
dials
and
the
button
brigades
pop
had
mentioned
lined
up
like
blank
typewriter
keys
but
enough
for
writing
chinese
just
aft
of
the
instrument
panel
were
two
very
strange
low
seats
they
seemed
to
be
facing
backwards
until
i
realized
they
were
meant
to
be
knelt
into
the
occupant
i
could
see
would
sort
of
sprawl
forward
his
hands
free
for
and
such
there
were
spongy
chinrests
aft
was
a
tiny
instrument
panel
and
a
kind
of
sideways
seat
not
nearly
so
fancy
the
door
by
which
we
entered
was
to
the
side
a
little
aft
i
did
see
any
indications
of
cabinets
or
fixed
storage
spaces
of
any
kinds
but
somehow
stuck
to
the
walls
here
and
there
were
quite
a
few
smooth
blobby
packages
mostly
dull
silver
too
some
large
some
small
valises
and
handbags
you
might
say
all
in
all
it
was
a
lovely
cabin
and
more
than
that
it
seemed
lived
in
it
looked
as
if
it
had
been
shaped
for
and
maybe
by
one
man
it
had
a
personality
you
could
feel
a
strong
but
warm
personality
of
its
own
then
i
realized
whose
personality
it
was
i
almost
got
sick
so
close
to
it
i
started
telling
myself
it
must
be
something
antigravity
did
to
your
stomach
but
it
was
all
too
interesting
to
let
you
get
sick
right
away
pop
was
poking
into
two
of
the
large
cases
that
were
sitting
loose
and
open
on
the
seat
as
if
ready
for
emergency
use
one
had
a
folded
something
with
straps
on
it
that
was
probably
a
parachute
the
second
had
i
judged
a
thousand
or
more
of
the
inch
cubes
such
as
pried
out
of
the
pilot
hand
all
neatly
stacked
in
a
cubical
box
inside
the
soft
outer
bag
you
could
see
the
gap
where
taken
the
one
i
decided
to
take
the
rest
of
the
bags
off
the
walls
and
open
them
if
i
could
figure
out
how
the
others
had
the
same
idea
but
alice
had
to
take
off
her
hook
and
put
on
her
pliers
before
she
could
make
progress
pop
helped
her
there
was
room
enough
for
us
to
do
these
things
without
crowding
each
other
too
closely
by
the
time
alice
was
set
to
go
i
discovered
the
trick
of
getting
the
bags
off
you
could
pull
them
away
from
the
wall
no
matter
what
force
you
used
at
least
i
could
and
you
could
even
slide
them
straight
along
the
walls
but
if
you
just
gave
them
a
gentle
counterclockwise
twist
they
came
off
like
nothing
twisting
them
clockwise
glued
them
back
on
it
was
very
strange
but
i
told
myself
that
if
these
boys
could
generate
antigravity
fields
they
could
create
screwy
fields
of
other
sorts
it
also
occurred
to
me
to
wonder
if
these
boys
came
from
earth
the
pilot
had
looked
human
enough
but
these
accomplishments
did
not
by
my
standards
for
human
achievement
in
the
age
of
the
deaders
at
any
rate
i
had
to
admit
to
myself
that
my
pet
term
cultural
queer
did
not
describe
to
my
own
satisfaction
members
of
a
culture
which
could
create
things
like
this
cabin
not
that
i
liked
making
the
admission
it
hard
to
admit
an
exception
to
a
pet
gripe
against
things
the
excitement
of
getting
down
and
opening
the
christmas
packages
saved
me
from
speculating
too
much
along
these
or
any
other
lines
i
hit
a
minor
jackpot
right
away
in
the
same
bag
were
a
compass
a
catalytic
pocket
lighter
a
knife
with
a
back
edge
that
made
my
affection
for
mother
waver
a
dust
mask
what
looked
like
a
compact
unit
and
several
other
items
adding
up
to
a
deluxe
deathlands
survival
kit
there
were
some
goggles
in
the
kit
i
did
savvy
until
i
put
them
on
and
surveyed
the
landscape
out
the
viewport
a
nearby
dust
drift
i
knew
to
be
hot
glowed
green
as
death
in
the
slightly
smoky
lenses
wow
those
specs
had
geiger
counters
beat
a
mile
and
i
privately
bet
myself
they
worked
at
night
i
stuck
them
in
my
pocket
quick
we
found
bunches
of
tiny
electronics
parts
i
think
they
were
spools
of
magnetic
tape
but
nothing
to
play
it
on
reels
of
very
narrow
film
with
frames
much
too
small
to
see
anything
at
all
unmagnified
about
three
thousand
cigarettes
in
unlabeled
transparent
packs
of
twenty
we
lit
up
quick
using
my
new
lighter
a
picture
book
that
did
make
much
sense
because
the
views
might
have
been
of
tissue
sections
or
starfields
we
could
quite
decide
and
there
were
no
captions
to
help
a
thin
book
with
ricepaper
pages
covered
with
chinese
characters
was
a
puzzler
a
thick
book
with
nothing
but
columns
of
figures
all
zeros
and
ones
and
nothing
else
some
tiny
chisels
and
a
mouth
organ
pop
make
a
point
of
just
helping
in
the
hunt
appropriated
that
last
item
i
might
have
known
he
would
i
told
myself
now
we
could
expect
turkey
in
the
straw
at
odd
moments
alice
found
a
whole
bag
of
what
were
women
things
judging
from
the
frilliness
of
the
garments
included
she
set
aside
some
and
little
gadgets
and
elastic
items
right
away
but
she
did
take
any
of
the
clothes
i
caught
her
measuring
some
kind
of
transparent
chemise
against
herself
when
she
thought
we
were
looking
it
was
for
a
girl
maybe
six
sizes
bigger
and
we
found
food
cans
of
food
that
was
heated
up
inside
by
the
time
you
got
the
top
rolled
off
though
the
outside
could
still
be
cool
to
the
touch
cans
of
boneless
steak
boneless
chops
cream
soup
peas
carrots
and
fried
potatoes
they
were
labeled
at
all
but
you
could
generally
guess
the
contents
from
the
shape
of
the
can
eggs
that
heated
when
you
touched
them
and
were
evenly
and
barely
firm
by
the
time
you
had
the
shell
broke
and
small
plastic
bottles
of
strong
coffee
that
heated
up
hospitably
too
in
this
case
the
tops
did
a
hesitation
in
the
middle
of
your
unscrewing
them
at
that
point
as
you
can
imagine
we
let
the
rest
of
the
packages
go
and
had
ourselves
a
feast
the
food
ate
even
better
than
it
smelled
it
was
real
hard
for
me
not
to
gorge
then
as
i
was
slurping
down
my
second
bottle
of
coffee
i
happened
to
look
out
the
viewport
and
see
the
pilot
body
and
the
darkening
puddle
around
it
and
the
coffee
began
to
taste
well
not
bad
but
sickening
i
do
think
it
was
guilty
conscience
deathlanders
outgrow
those
if
they
ever
have
them
to
start
with
loners
do
keep
consciences
it
takes
cultures
to
give
you
those
and
make
them
work
artistic
inappropriateness
is
the
closest
i
can
come
to
describing
what
bothered
me
whatever
it
was
it
made
me
feel
lousy
for
a
minute
about
the
same
time
alice
did
an
odd
thing
with
the
last
of
coffee
she
slopped
it
on
a
rag
and
used
it
to
wash
her
face
i
guess
she
caught
a
reflection
of
herself
with
the
blood
smears
she
eat
any
more
after
that
either
pop
kept
on
chomping
away
a
slow
feeder
and
appreciative
to
be
doing
something
i
started
to
inspect
the
instrument
panel
and
right
away
i
was
all
excited
again
the
two
screens
were
what
got
me
they
showed
shadowy
maps
one
of
north
america
the
other
of
the
world
the
first
one
was
a
whole
lot
like
the
map
i
been
imagining
earlier
faint
colors
marked
the
small
civilized
areas
including
one
in
eastern
canada
and
another
in
upper
michigan
that
must
be
countries
i
did
know
about
and
the
deathlands
were
real
dark
just
as
always
maintained
they
should
be
south
of
lake
michigan
was
a
brightly
luminous
green
point
that
must
be
where
we
were
i
decided
and
for
some
reason
the
colored
areas
representing
los
alamos
and
atlantic
highlands
were
glowing
brighter
than
the
others
they
had
an
active
luminosity
los
alamos
was
blue
violet
los
alamos
was
shown
having
more
territory
than
i
expected
savannah
fortress
for
that
matter
was
a
whole
bigger
than
i
have
made
it
pushing
out
pseudopods
west
and
northeast
along
the
coast
though
its
red
did
have
the
extra
glow
but
its
reeked
of
imperialism
the
world
screen
showed
dim
color
patches
too
but
for
the
moment
i
was
more
interested
in
the
other
the
button
armies
marched
right
up
to
the
lower
edge
of
the
screens
and
right
away
i
got
the
crazy
hunch
that
they
were
connected
with
spots
on
the
map
push
the
button
for
a
certain
spot
and
the
plane
would
go
there
why
one
button
even
seemed
to
have
a
faint
violet
nimbus
around
it
or
else
my
eyes
were
going
bad
as
if
to
say
push
me
and
we
go
to
atlantic
highlands
a
crazy
notion
as
i
say
and
no
sensible
way
to
handle
a
navigation
according
to
any
standards
i
could
imagine
but
then
as
also
said
this
plane
did
seem
to
be
designed
according
to
any
standards
but
rather
in
line
with
one
man
ideas
including
his
whims
at
any
rate
that
was
my
hunch
about
the
buttons
and
the
screens
it
tantalized
rather
than
helped
for
the
only
button
that
seemed
to
be
marked
in
any
way
was
the
one
guessing
by
color
for
atlantic
highlands
and
i
certainly
did
want
to
go
there
like
alamos
has
the
reputation
for
being
a
mysteriously
dangerous
place
not
openly
mean
and
like
walla
walla
or
porter
but
buggers
who
swing
too
close
to
have
a
way
of
never
turning
up
again
you
never
expect
to
see
again
two
out
of
three
buggers
who
pass
in
the
night
but
for
three
out
of
three
to
keep
disappearing
is
against
statistics
alice
was
beside
me
now
scanning
things
over
too
and
from
the
way
she
frowned
and
what
not
i
gathered
she
had
caught
my
hunch
and
also
shared
my
puzzlement
now
was
the
time
all
right
when
we
needed
an
instruction
manual
and
not
one
in
chinese
neither
pop
swallowed
a
mouthful
and
said
yep
now
be
a
good
time
to
have
him
back
for
a
minute
to
explain
things
a
bit
oh
do
take
offense
ray
i
know
how
it
was
for
you
and
for
you
too
alice
i
know
the
both
of
you
to
murder
him
it
was
a
matter
of
free
choice
it
the
way
us
deathlanders
are
built
just
the
same
it
be
nice
to
have
a
way
of
killing
and
keeping
them
on
hand
at
the
same
time
i
remember
feeling
that
way
after
murdering
the
alamoser
i
told
you
about
you
see
i
come
down
with
the
very
fever
i
faked
and
almost
died
of
it
while
the
man
who
could
have
cured
me
easy
would
do
nothing
but
perfume
the
landscape
with
the
help
of
a
gang
of
anaerobic
bacteria
stubborn
cuss
the
first
part
of
that
oration
started
up
my
sickness
again
and
irked
me
not
a
little
dammit
what
right
had
pop
to
talk
about
how
all
us
deathlanders
kill
which
was
true
enough
and
by
itself
would
have
made
me
cotton
to
him
if
as
he
claimed
earlier
been
able
to
quit
killing
pop
was
an
old
hypocrite
i
told
myself
he
helped
murder
the
pilot
he
admitted
as
much
and
alice
and
me
be
better
off
if
we
bedded
the
both
of
them
down
together
but
then
the
second
part
of
what
pop
said
so
made
me
want
to
feel
pleasantly
sorry
for
myself
and
laugh
at
the
same
time
that
i
forgave
the
old
geezer
practically
everything
pop
said
had
that
reassuring
touch
of
insanity
about
it
so
it
was
alice
who
said
shut
up
pop
and
rather
casually
at
that
and
she
and
me
went
on
to
speculate
and
then
to
argue
about
which
buttons
we
ought
to
push
if
any
and
in
what
order
why
not
just
start
anywhere
and
keep
pushing
one
after
another
you
going
to
have
to
eventually
may
as
well
start
now
was
pop
contribution
to
the
discussion
got
to
take
some
chances
in
this
life
he
was
sitting
in
the
back
seat
and
still
nibbling
away
like
a
mangy
old
squirrel
of
course
alice
and
me
knew
more
than
that
we
kept
making
guesses
as
to
how
the
buttons
worked
and
then
backing
up
our
guesses
with
hot
language
it
was
a
little
like
two
savages
trying
to
decide
how
to
play
chess
by
looking
at
the
pieces
and
then
the
old
theme
took
hold
of
us
again
and
we
studied
the
colored
blobs
on
the
world
screen
trying
to
decide
which
would
have
the
fanciest
accommodations
for
blase
on
the
north
america
screen
too
there
was
an
intriguing
pink
patch
in
southern
mexico
that
seemed
to
take
in
old
mexico
city
and
acapulco
too
quit
talking
and
start
pushing
pop
prodded
us
this
way
getting
nowhere
fast
i
ca
stand
hesitation
it
riles
my
nerves
alice
thought
you
ought
to
push
ten
buttons
at
once
using
both
hands
and
she
was
working
out
patterns
for
me
to
try
but
i
was
off
on
a
kick
about
how
we
should
darken
the
plane
to
see
if
any
of
the
other
buttons
glowed
beside
the
one
with
the
violet
look
here
you
killed
a
big
man
to
get
this
plane
pop
broke
in
coming
up
behind
me
are
you
going
to
use
it
for
discussion
groups
or
are
you
going
to
fly
it
quiet
i
told
him
i
got
a
new
hunch
and
was
using
the
dark
glasses
to
scan
the
instrument
panel
they
did
show
anything
dammit
i
ca
stand
this
any
more
pop
said
and
reached
a
hand
and
arm
between
us
and
brought
it
down
on
about
fifty
buttons
i
judge
the
other
buttons
just
went
down
and
up
but
the
button
went
down
and
stayed
down
the
violet
blob
of
on
the
screen
got
even
brighter
in
the
next
few
moments
the
door
closed
with
a
tiny
thud
we
took
off
chapter
man
who
deals
in
murder
must
have
very
incorrect
ways
of
thinking
and
truly
inaccurate
de
quincey
murder
considered
as
one
of
the
fine
arts
for
that
matter
we
took
off
with
the
plane
swinging
to
beat
hell
alice
and
me
was
in
the
two
kneeling
seats
and
we
hugged
them
tight
but
pop
was
loose
and
sort
of
rattled
around
the
cabin
for
a
while
and
serve
him
right
on
one
of
the
swings
i
caught
a
glimpse
of
the
seven
dented
gas
tanks
looking
like
dull
crescents
from
this
angle
through
the
orange
haze
and
getting
rapidly
smaller
as
they
hazed
out
after
a
while
the
plane
levelled
off
and
quit
swinging
and
a
while
after
that
my
image
of
the
cabin
quit
swinging
too
once
again
i
just
managed
to
stave
off
the
vomits
this
time
the
vomits
from
natural
causes
alice
looked
very
pale
around
the
gills
and
kept
her
face
buried
in
the
chinrest
of
her
chair
pop
ended
up
right
in
our
faces
sort
of
against
the
instrument
panel
in
getting
himself
off
it
he
must
have
braced
his
hands
against
half
the
buttons
at
one
time
or
another
and
i
noticed
that
none
of
them
went
down
a
fraction
they
were
it
had
probably
happened
automatically
when
the
button
got
pushed
i
have
stopped
him
messing
around
in
that
apish
way
but
with
the
state
of
my
stomach
i
lacked
all
ambition
and
was
happy
just
not
to
be
smelling
him
so
close
i
still
was
taking
too
great
an
interest
in
things
as
i
idly
watched
the
old
geezer
rummaging
around
the
cabin
for
something
that
got
misplaced
in
the
eventually
he
found
it
a
small
can
he
opened
it
sure
enough
it
turned
out
to
have
almonds
in
it
he
fitted
himself
in
the
back
seat
and
munched
them
one
at
a
time
ish
nothing
like
a
few
nuts
to
top
off
with
he
said
cheerfully
i
could
have
cut
his
throat
even
more
cheerfully
but
the
damage
had
been
done
and
you
think
twice
before
you
kill
a
person
in
close
quarters
when
you
are
absolutely
sure
you
be
able
to
dispose
of
the
body
how
did
i
know
i
be
able
to
open
the
door
i
remember
philosophizing
that
pop
ought
at
least
to
have
broke
an
arm
so
he
be
as
badly
off
as
alice
and
me
though
for
that
matter
my
right
arm
was
fully
recovered
now
but
he
was
all
in
one
piece
there
no
justice
in
events
for
sure
the
plane
ploughed
along
silently
through
the
orange
soup
though
there
was
really
no
way
to
tell
it
was
moving
now
until
a
skewy
spindle
shape
loomed
up
ahead
and
shot
back
over
the
viewport
i
think
it
was
a
vulture
i
do
know
how
vultures
manage
to
operate
in
the
haze
which
ought
to
cancel
their
keen
eyesight
but
they
do
it
shot
past
alice
lifted
her
face
out
of
the
sponge
stuff
and
began
to
study
the
buttons
again
i
heaved
myself
up
and
around
a
little
and
said
pop
alice
and
me
are
going
to
try
to
work
out
how
this
plane
navigates
this
time
we
do
want
no
interference
i
did
say
a
word
more
about
what
he
done
it
never
does
to
hash
over
stupidities
that
perfectly
fine
go
right
ahead
he
told
me
i
feel
calm
as
a
kitten
now
we
going
somewheres
that
all
that
ever
matters
with
me
he
chuckled
a
bit
and
added
you
got
to
admit
i
gave
you
and
alice
something
to
work
with
but
then
he
had
the
sense
to
shut
up
tight
we
were
so
chary
of
pushing
buttons
this
time
but
ten
minutes
or
so
convinced
us
that
you
could
push
any
of
the
buttons
any
more
they
all
locked
down
all
locked
except
for
maybe
one
which
we
try
at
first
for
a
special
reason
we
looked
for
other
controls
sticks
levers
pedals
and
the
like
there
were
any
alice
went
back
and
tried
the
buttons
on
pop
minor
console
they
were
locked
too
pop
looked
interested
but
did
say
a
word
we
realized
in
a
general
way
what
had
happened
of
course
pushing
the
button
had
set
us
on
some
kind
of
irreversible
automatic
i
could
imagine
the
why
of
gimmicking
a
plane
controls
like
that
unless
maybe
to
keep
loose
children
or
prisoners
from
being
able
to
mess
things
up
while
the
pilot
took
a
snooze
but
there
were
a
lot
of
whys
to
this
plane
that
did
seem
to
have
any
standard
answers
the
business
of
taking
off
on
irreversible
automatic
had
happened
so
neatly
that
i
naturally
wondered
whether
pop
might
not
know
more
about
navigating
this
plane
than
he
let
on
a
whole
lot
more
in
fact
and
the
seemingly
idiotic
petulance
of
his
pushing
all
the
buttons
have
been
a
shrewd
cover
for
pushing
the
button
but
if
pop
had
been
acting
he
been
acting
beautifully
with
a
serene
disregard
for
the
chances
of
breaking
his
own
neck
i
decided
this
was
a
possibility
i
could
think
about
later
and
maybe
act
on
then
after
alice
and
me
had
worked
through
the
more
obvious
stuff
the
reason
we
had
tried
the
one
button
yet
was
that
it
showed
a
green
nimbus
just
like
the
button
had
had
a
violet
nimbus
now
there
was
no
green
on
either
of
the
screens
except
for
the
tiny
green
star
that
i
had
figured
stood
for
the
plane
and
it
did
make
sense
to
go
where
we
already
were
and
if
it
meant
some
other
place
some
place
not
shown
on
the
screens
you
bet
we
were
going
to
be
too
quick
about
deciding
to
go
there
it
might
not
be
on
earth
alice
expressed
it
by
saying
my
namesake
was
always
a
little
too
quick
at
responding
to
those
drink
me
cues
i
suppose
she
thought
she
was
being
cryptic
but
i
fooled
her
in
i
asked
she
nodded
and
gave
me
a
little
smile
not
at
all
like
one
of
the
eat
me
smiles
she
given
me
last
evening
it
is
funny
how
crazily
happy
a
little
touch
of
the
intellectual
past
like
that
can
make
you
feel
and
how
horribly
uncomfortable
a
moment
later
we
both
started
to
study
the
north
america
screen
again
and
almost
at
once
we
realized
that
it
had
changed
in
one
small
particular
the
green
star
had
twinned
where
there
had
been
one
point
of
green
light
there
were
now
two
very
close
together
like
the
double
star
in
the
handle
of
the
dipper
we
watched
it
for
a
while
the
distance
between
the
two
stars
grew
perceptibly
greater
we
watched
it
for
a
while
longer
considerably
longer
it
became
clear
that
the
position
of
the
more
westerly
star
on
the
screen
was
fixed
while
the
more
easterly
star
was
moving
east
toward
with
about
the
speed
of
the
tip
of
the
minute
hand
on
a
wrist
watch
two
inches
an
hour
say
the
pattern
began
to
make
sense
i
figured
it
this
way
the
moving
star
must
stand
for
the
plane
the
other
green
dot
must
stand
for
where
the
plane
had
just
been
for
some
reason
the
spot
on
the
freeway
by
the
old
cracking
plant
was
recognized
as
a
marked
locality
by
the
screen
why
i
do
know
it
reminded
me
of
the
old
x
marks
the
spot
of
newspaper
murders
but
that
would
be
getting
very
fancy
anyway
the
spot
we
just
taken
off
from
was
so
marked
and
in
that
case
the
button
with
the
green
nimbus
hold
tight
everybody
i
said
to
alice
grudgingly
including
pop
in
my
warning
i
got
to
try
it
i
gripped
my
seat
with
my
knees
and
one
arm
and
pushed
the
green
button
it
pushed
the
plane
swung
around
in
a
level
loop
not
too
tight
to
disturb
the
stomach
much
and
steadied
out
again
i
could
judge
how
far
we
swung
but
alice
and
me
watched
the
green
stars
and
after
about
a
minute
she
said
they
getting
closer
and
a
little
while
later
i
said
yeah
for
sure
i
scanned
the
board
the
green
button
the
button
to
call
it
that
was
locked
down
of
course
the
button
was
up
glowing
violet
all
the
other
buttons
were
still
up
and
up
i
tried
them
all
again
it
was
clear
as
day
used
to
be
we
could
either
go
to
or
we
could
go
back
where
we
started
from
there
was
no
third
possibility
it
was
a
little
hard
to
take
you
think
of
a
plane
as
freedom
as
something
that
will
carry
you
anywhere
in
the
world
you
choose
to
go
especially
any
paradise
and
then
you
find
yourself
worse
limited
than
if
you
stayed
on
the
ground
at
least
that
was
the
way
it
was
happening
to
us
but
alice
and
me
were
realists
we
knew
it
would
help
to
wail
we
were
up
against
another
of
those
two
problems
the
problem
of
two
destinations
and
we
had
to
choose
ours
we
go
i
thought
can
trek
on
somewhere
anywhere
richer
by
the
loot
from
the
plane
especially
that
survival
kit
trek
on
with
some
loot
we
mostly
never
understand
and
with
the
knowledge
that
we
are
leaving
a
plane
that
can
fly
that
we
are
shrinking
back
from
an
unknown
if
we
go
back
there
something
else
we
have
to
face
something
we
have
to
live
with
for
a
little
while
at
least
that
wo
be
nice
to
live
with
after
this
cozily
personal
cabin
something
that
bother
me
at
all
but
dammit
it
alice
made
the
decision
for
us
and
at
the
same
time
showed
she
was
thinking
about
the
same
thing
as
me
i
do
want
to
have
to
smell
him
ray
she
said
i
am
not
going
back
to
keep
company
with
that
filthy
corpse
i
rather
anything
than
that
and
she
pushed
the
button
again
and
as
the
plane
started
to
swing
she
looked
at
me
defiantly
as
if
to
say
i
reverse
the
course
again
over
her
dead
body
do
tense
up
i
told
her
i
want
a
new
shake
of
the
dice
myself
you
know
alice
pop
said
reflectively
it
was
the
smell
of
my
alamoser
got
to
me
too
i
just
could
bear
it
i
could
get
away
from
it
because
my
fever
had
me
pinned
down
so
there
was
nothing
left
for
me
to
do
but
go
crazy
no
for
me
just
my
mind
died
though
not
my
memory
by
the
time
i
got
my
strength
back
started
to
be
a
new
bugger
i
did
know
no
more
about
living
than
a
newborn
babe
except
i
knew
i
could
go
back
go
back
to
murdering
and
all
that
my
new
mind
knew
that
much
though
otherwise
it
was
just
a
blank
it
was
all
very
funny
and
then
i
suppose
alice
cut
in
her
voice
corrosive
with
sarcasm
you
hunted
up
a
wandering
preacher
or
perhaps
a
kindly
old
hermit
who
lived
on
hot
manna
and
he
showed
you
the
blue
sky
why
no
alice
pop
said
i
told
you
i
do
go
for
religion
as
it
happens
i
hunted
me
up
a
couple
of
murderers
guys
who
were
worse
cases
then
myself
but
who
wanted
to
quit
because
it
was
getting
them
nowhere
and
who
found
i
heard
a
way
of
quitting
and
the
three
of
us
had
a
long
talk
together
and
they
told
you
the
great
secret
of
how
to
live
in
the
deathlands
without
killing
alice
continued
acidly
drop
the
nonsense
pop
it
ca
be
done
it
hard
i
grant
you
pop
said
you
have
to
go
crazy
or
something
almost
as
bad
in
fact
maybe
going
crazy
is
the
easiest
way
but
it
can
be
done
and
in
the
long
run
murder
is
even
harder
i
decided
to
interrupt
this
idle
chatter
since
we
were
now
definitely
headed
for
and
there
was
nothing
to
do
until
we
got
there
unless
one
of
us
got
a
brainstorm
about
the
controls
it
was
time
to
start
on
the
less
obvious
stuff
i
tabled
in
my
mind
why
are
you
on
this
plane
pop
i
asked
sharply
what
do
you
figure
on
getting
out
of
alice
and
me
and
i
do
mean
the
free
meals
he
grinned
his
teeth
were
white
and
even
plates
of
course
why
ray
he
said
i
was
just
giving
alice
the
reason
i
like
to
talk
to
murderers
practicing
murderers
preferred
i
need
to
to
talk
to
to
keep
myself
straight
otherwise
i
might
start
killing
again
and
i
not
up
to
that
any
more
oh
so
you
get
your
kicks
at
second
hand
you
old
peeper
alice
put
in
but
quit
lying
pop
i
said
about
having
quit
killing
for
one
thing
in
my
books
which
happen
to
be
the
old
books
in
this
case
the
accomplice
is
every
bit
as
guilty
as
the
man
with
the
slicer
you
helped
us
kill
the
pilot
by
giving
that
funny
scream
and
you
know
it
who
says
i
did
pop
countered
rearing
up
a
little
i
never
said
so
i
just
said
it
he
hesitated
a
moment
studying
me
then
he
said
i
was
the
one
gave
that
scream
in
fact
i
have
stopped
it
if
i
been
able
who
did
then
again
he
studied
me
as
he
hesitated
i
not
telling
he
said
settling
back
pop
i
said
sharp
again
buggers
who
pad
together
tell
everything
oh
yeah
he
agreed
smiling
i
remember
saying
that
to
quite
a
few
guys
in
my
day
it
a
very
restful
comradely
sentiment
i
killed
every
last
one
of
too
you
may
have
pop
i
granted
but
we
two
to
one
so
you
are
he
agreed
softly
looking
the
both
of
us
over
i
knew
what
he
was
thinking
that
alice
still
had
just
her
pliers
on
and
that
in
these
close
quarters
his
knives
were
as
good
as
my
gun
give
me
your
right
hand
alice
i
said
without
taking
my
eyes
off
pop
i
reached
the
knife
without
a
handle
out
of
her
belt
and
then
i
started
to
unscrew
the
pliers
out
of
her
stump
pop
i
said
as
i
did
so
you
may
have
quit
killing
for
all
i
know
i
mean
you
may
have
quit
killing
clean
decent
deathland
style
but
i
believe
one
bit
of
that
guff
about
having
to
talk
to
murderers
to
keep
your
mind
sweet
furthermore
it
true
though
he
interrupted
i
got
to
keep
myself
reminded
of
how
lousy
it
feels
to
be
a
murderer
so
i
said
well
here
one
person
who
believes
you
got
a
more
practical
reason
for
being
on
this
plane
pop
what
the
bounty
gives
you
for
every
deathlander
you
bring
in
what
would
it
be
for
two
live
deathlanders
and
what
sort
of
reward
would
they
pay
for
a
lost
plane
brought
in
seems
to
me
they
might
very
well
make
you
a
citizen
for
that
yes
even
give
you
your
own
church
alice
added
with
a
sort
of
wicked
gaiety
i
squeezed
her
stump
gently
to
tell
her
let
me
handle
it
why
i
guess
you
can
believe
that
if
you
want
to
pop
said
and
let
out
a
soft
breath
seems
to
me
you
need
a
lot
of
coincidences
and
happenstances
to
make
that
theory
hold
water
but
you
sure
can
believe
it
if
you
want
to
i
got
no
way
ray
to
prove
to
you
i
telling
the
truth
except
to
say
i
am
right
i
said
and
then
i
threw
the
next
one
at
him
real
fast
more
pop
were
you
traveling
in
this
plane
to
begin
with
that
cuts
a
happenstance
did
you
hop
out
while
we
were
too
busy
with
the
pilot
to
notice
and
just
to
be
coming
from
the
cracking
plant
were
the
buttons
locked
because
you
were
the
pilot
prisoner
pop
creased
his
brow
thoughtfully
it
could
have
been
that
way
he
said
at
last
could
have
been
according
to
the
evidence
as
you
saw
it
it
quite
a
bright
idea
ray
i
can
almost
see
myself
skulking
in
this
cabin
while
you
and
alice
you
were
skulking
somewhere
i
said
i
finished
screwing
in
the
knife
and
gave
alice
back
her
hand
i
repeat
it
pop
i
said
we
two
to
one
you
better
talk
yes
alice
added
disregarding
my
previous
hint
you
may
have
given
up
fighting
pop
but
i
have
not
fighting
nor
killing
nor
anything
in
between
those
two
any
least
thing
my
girl
was
being
her
most
pantherish
now
who
says
i
given
up
pop
demanded
rearing
a
little
again
you
people
assume
too
much
it
a
dangerous
habit
before
we
have
any
trouble
and
somebody
squawks
about
me
cheating
let
get
one
thing
straight
if
anybody
jumps
me
i
try
to
disable
them
i
try
to
hurt
them
in
any
way
short
of
killing
and
that
means
hamstringing
and
and
everything
else
every
least
thing
alice
and
if
they
happen
to
die
while
i
honestly
just
trying
to
hurt
them
in
a
way
short
of
killing
then
i
wo
grieve
too
much
my
conscience
will
be
reasonably
clear
is
that
understood
i
had
to
admit
that
it
was
pop
might
be
lying
about
a
lot
of
things
but
i
just
did
believe
he
was
lying
about
this
and
i
already
knew
pop
was
quick
for
his
age
and
strong
enough
if
alice
and
me
jumped
him
now
there
be
blood
let
six
different
ways
you
ca
jump
a
man
who
has
a
dozen
knives
easy
to
hand
and
not
expect
that
to
happen
two
to
one
or
not
we
get
him
in
the
end
but
it
would
be
gory
and
now
pop
said
quietly
i
talk
a
little
if
you
do
mind
look
here
ray
alice
the
two
of
you
are
confirmed
murderers
i
know
you
would
tell
me
nothing
different
and
being
such
you
both
know
that
there
nothing
in
murder
in
the
long
run
it
satisfies
a
hunger
and
maybe
gets
you
a
little
loot
and
it
lets
you
get
on
to
the
next
killing
but
that
all
absolutely
all
yet
you
got
to
do
it
because
it
the
way
you
built
the
urge
is
there
it
an
overpowering
urge
and
you
got
nothing
to
oppose
it
with
you
feel
the
big
grief
and
the
big
resentment
the
dust
is
eating
at
your
bones
you
ca
stand
the
city
squares
the
porterites
and
mantenors
and
such
because
you
know
they
whistling
in
the
dark
and
it
a
dirty
tune
so
you
go
on
killing
but
if
there
were
a
decent
practical
way
to
quit
you
take
it
at
least
i
think
you
would
when
you
still
thought
this
plane
could
take
you
to
rio
or
europe
you
felt
that
way
you
you
were
planning
to
go
there
as
murderers
were
you
you
were
going
to
leave
your
trade
behind
it
was
pretty
quiet
in
the
cabin
for
a
couple
of
seconds
then
thin
laugh
sliced
the
silence
we
were
dreaming
then
she
said
we
were
out
of
our
heads
but
now
you
talking
about
practical
things
as
you
say
what
do
you
expect
us
to
do
if
we
quit
our
trade
as
you
call
it
go
into
walla
walla
or
ouachita
and
give
ourselves
up
i
might
lose
more
than
my
right
hand
at
ouachita
this
time
that
was
just
on
suspicion
or
i
added
meaningfully
are
you
expecting
us
to
admit
murderers
when
we
get
to
pop
the
old
geezer
smiled
and
thinned
his
eyes
now
that
accomplish
much
would
it
most
places
they
just
string
you
up
maybe
after
tickling
your
pain
nerves
a
bit
or
if
it
was
manteno
they
might
put
you
in
a
cage
and
feed
you
slops
and
pray
over
you
and
would
that
help
you
or
anybody
else
if
a
man
or
woman
quits
killing
there
a
lot
of
things
he
got
to
straighten
out
first
his
own
mind
and
feelings
next
he
got
to
do
what
he
can
to
make
up
for
the
murders
done
help
the
next
of
kin
if
any
and
so
on
then
he
got
to
carry
the
news
to
other
killers
who
have
heard
it
yet
he
got
no
time
to
waste
being
hanged
believe
me
he
got
work
lined
up
for
him
work
that
got
to
be
done
mostly
in
the
deathlands
and
it
the
sort
of
work
the
city
squares
ca
help
him
with
one
bit
because
they
just
do
understand
us
murderers
and
what
makes
us
tick
we
have
to
do
it
ourselves
hey
pop
i
cut
in
getting
a
little
interested
in
the
argument
there
was
anything
else
to
get
interested
in
until
we
got
to
or
pop
let
down
his
guard
i
dig
you
on
the
city
squares
i
call
cultural
queers
and
what
sort
of
fatheads
they
are
but
just
the
same
for
a
man
to
quit
killing
he
got
to
quit
it
he
got
to
belong
to
a
community
he
got
to
have
a
culture
of
some
sort
no
matter
how
disgusting
or
nutsy
well
pop
said
do
us
deathlanders
have
a
culture
with
customs
and
folkways
and
all
the
rest
a
very
tight
little
culture
in
fact
nutsy
as
all
get
out
of
course
but
that
one
of
the
beauties
of
it
oh
sure
i
granted
him
but
it
a
culture
based
on
murder
and
devoted
wholly
to
murder
murder
is
our
way
of
life
that
gets
your
argument
nowhere
pop
correction
he
said
or
rather
and
now
for
a
little
while
his
voice
got
less
harsh
and
yet
bigger
somehow
as
if
it
were
more
than
just
pop
talking
every
culture
he
said
is
a
way
of
growth
as
well
as
a
way
of
life
because
the
first
law
of
life
is
growth
our
deathland
culture
is
devoted
to
growing
murder
murder
that
my
thought
it
about
the
toughest
way
of
growth
anybody
was
ever
asked
to
face
up
to
but
it
a
way
of
growth
just
the
same
a
lot
bigger
and
fancier
cultures
never
could
figure
out
the
answer
to
the
problem
of
war
and
killing
know
that
all
right
we
inhabit
their
grandest
failure
maybe
us
deathlanders
working
with
murder
every
day
unable
to
pretend
that
it
is
part
of
every
one
of
us
unable
to
put
it
out
of
our
minds
like
the
city
squares
do
maybe
us
deathlanders
are
the
ones
to
do
that
little
job
but
hell
pop
i
objected
getting
excited
in
spite
of
myself
even
if
we
got
a
culture
here
in
the
deathlands
a
culture
that
can
grow
it
ai
a
culture
that
can
deal
with
repentant
murderers
in
a
culture
a
murderer
feels
guilty
and
confesses
and
then
he
gets
hanged
or
imprisoned
a
long
time
and
that
squares
things
for
him
and
everybody
you
need
religion
and
courts
and
hangmen
and
screws
and
all
the
rest
of
it
i
do
think
it
enough
for
a
man
just
to
say
he
sorry
and
go
around
other
killers
is
going
to
be
enough
to
wipe
out
his
sense
of
guilt
pop
squared
his
eyes
at
mine
are
you
so
fancy
that
you
have
to
have
a
sense
of
guilt
ray
he
demanded
ca
you
just
see
when
lousy
a
sense
of
guilt
a
luxury
of
course
it
not
enough
to
say
you
sorry
you
going
to
have
to
spend
a
good
part
of
the
rest
of
your
life
making
up
for
what
you
done
and
what
you
will
do
too
but
about
hanging
and
prisons
was
it
ever
proved
those
were
the
right
thing
for
murderers
as
for
religion
now
some
of
us
who
quit
killing
are
religious
and
a
lot
of
us
me
included
are
and
some
of
the
ones
that
are
religious
figure
maybe
because
there
no
way
for
them
to
get
hanged
that
they
damned
eternally
but
that
does
stop
them
doing
good
work
i
ask
you
now
is
any
little
thing
like
being
damned
eternally
a
satisfactory
excuse
for
behaving
like
a
complete
rat
that
did
it
somehow
that
last
statement
of
pop
appealed
so
much
to
me
and
was
completely
crazy
at
the
same
time
that
i
could
help
warming
up
to
him
do
get
me
wrong
i
did
really
fall
for
his
line
of
chatter
at
all
but
i
found
it
fun
to
go
along
with
it
so
long
as
the
plane
was
in
this
shuttle
situation
and
we
had
nothing
better
to
do
alice
seemed
to
feel
the
same
way
i
guess
any
bugger
that
could
kid
religion
the
way
pop
could
got
a
little
silver
star
in
her
books
bronze
anyway
right
away
the
atmosphere
got
easier
to
start
with
we
asked
pop
to
tell
us
about
this
us
he
kept
mentioning
and
he
said
it
was
some
dozens
or
hundreds
nobody
had
accurate
figures
of
killers
who
quit
and
went
nomading
around
the
deathlands
trying
to
recruit
others
and
help
those
who
wanted
to
be
helped
they
had
meeting
places
where
they
tried
to
get
together
at
dates
but
mostly
they
kept
on
the
go
by
twos
and
threes
or
more
rarely
alone
they
were
all
men
so
far
at
least
pop
had
heard
of
any
women
members
but
he
assured
alice
earnestly
he
would
personally
guarantee
that
there
would
be
no
objections
to
a
girl
joining
up
they
had
recently
taken
to
calling
themselves
murderers
anonymous
after
some
organization
pop
did
know
the
original
purpose
of
quite
a
few
of
them
had
slipped
and
gone
back
to
murdering
again
but
some
of
these
had
come
back
after
a
while
more
determined
than
ever
to
make
a
go
of
it
we
welcomed
of
course
pop
said
we
welcome
everybody
everybody
that
a
genuine
murderer
that
is
and
says
he
wants
to
quit
guys
that
are
blooded
yet
we
draw
the
line
at
no
matter
how
fine
they
are
also
we
have
a
lot
of
fun
at
our
meetings
pop
assured
us
you
never
saw
such
high
times
nobody
got
a
right
to
go
glooming
around
or
pull
a
long
face
just
because
he
done
a
killing
or
two
religion
or
no
religion
pride
a
sin
alice
and
me
ate
it
all
up
like
we
was
a
couple
of
kids
and
pop
was
telling
us
fairy
tales
that
what
it
all
was
of
course
a
fairy
tale
a
crazy
fairy
tale
alice
and
me
knew
there
could
be
no
fellowship
of
deathlanders
like
pop
was
describing
it
was
impossible
as
blue
sky
but
it
gave
us
a
kick
to
pretend
to
ourselves
for
a
while
to
believe
in
it
pop
could
talk
forever
apparently
about
murder
and
murderers
and
he
had
a
bottomless
bag
of
funny
stories
on
the
same
topic
and
character
vignettes
the
murderers
who
were
forever
wanting
their
victims
to
understand
and
forgive
them
the
ones
who
thought
of
themselves
as
little
kings
with
divine
rights
of
dispensing
death
the
ones
who
insisted
on
laying
down
chastely
beside
their
finished
victims
and
playing
dead
for
a
couple
of
hours
the
ones
who
were
so
chaste
the
ones
who
could
only
do
their
killings
when
they
were
dressed
a
certain
way
and
the
troubles
they
had
with
their
murder
costumes
the
ones
who
could
only
kill
people
with
certain
traits
or
of
a
certain
appearance
say
or
people
who
read
books
or
who
could
carry
tunes
or
who
used
bad
language
the
ones
who
always
mixed
sex
and
murder
and
the
ones
who
believed
that
murder
was
contaminated
by
the
least
breath
of
sex
the
sticklers
and
the
sloppy
joes
the
artists
and
the
butchers
the
and
the
and
the
honestly
pop
portraits
from
life
added
up
to
a
dance
of
death
as
good
as
anything
the
middle
ages
ever
produced
and
they
ought
to
have
been
illustrated
like
those
by
some
great
artist
pop
told
us
a
lot
about
his
own
killings
too
alice
and
me
was
interested
but
neither
of
us
tempted
into
making
parallel
revelations
about
ourselves
your
private
life
your
own
business
i
felt
as
close
as
your
guts
and
no
good
enough
to
justify
revealing
a
knot
of
it
not
that
we
talked
about
nothing
but
murder
while
we
were
bulleting
along
toward
the
conversation
was
and
we
got
onto
all
sorts
of
topics
for
instance
we
got
to
talking
about
the
plane
and
how
it
flew
itself
or
levitated
itself
rather
i
said
it
must
generate
an
antigravity
field
that
was
keyed
to
the
body
of
the
plane
but
nothing
else
so
that
did
feel
lighter
nor
any
of
the
objects
in
the
cabin
it
just
worked
on
the
dull
silvery
metal
and
i
proved
my
point
by
using
mother
to
shave
a
little
wisp
of
metal
off
the
edge
of
the
control
board
the
curlicue
stayed
in
the
air
wherever
you
put
it
and
when
you
moved
it
you
could
feel
the
faintest
sort
of
gyroscopic
resistance
it
was
very
strange
pop
pointed
out
it
was
a
little
like
magnetism
a
germ
riding
on
an
iron
filing
that
was
traveling
toward
the
pole
of
a
big
magnet
would
feel
the
magnetic
pull
it
would
be
operating
on
him
only
on
the
iron
but
just
the
same
the
germ
be
carried
along
with
the
filing
and
feel
its
acceleration
and
all
provided
he
could
hold
on
but
for
that
purpose
you
could
imagine
a
tiny
cabin
in
the
filing
that
what
we
are
pop
added
three
germs
jumbo
size
alice
wanted
to
know
why
an
antigravity
plane
should
have
even
the
stubbiest
wings
or
a
jet
for
that
matter
for
we
remembered
now
noticed
the
tubes
and
i
said
it
was
maybe
just
a
reserve
system
in
case
the
antigravity
failed
and
pop
guessed
it
might
be
for
battle
maneuvering
or
even
for
operating
outside
the
atmosphere
which
hardly
made
sense
as
i
proved
to
him
if
we
a
battle
plane
where
our
guns
alice
asked
none
of
us
had
an
answer
we
remembered
the
noise
the
plane
had
made
before
we
saw
it
it
must
have
been
using
its
jets
then
and
do
you
suppose
pop
asked
that
it
was
something
from
the
antigravity
that
made
electricity
flare
out
of
the
top
of
the
cracking
plant
like
to
have
scared
the
pants
off
me
no
answer
to
that
either
now
was
a
logical
time
of
course
to
ask
pop
what
he
knew
about
the
cracking
plant
and
just
who
had
done
the
scream
if
not
him
but
i
figured
he
still
would
talk
as
long
as
we
were
acting
friendly
there
was
no
point
in
spoiling
it
we
guessed
around
a
little
though
about
where
the
plane
came
from
pop
said
alamos
i
said
alice
said
why
not
from
both
why
alamos
and
have
some
sort
of
treaty
and
the
plane
be
traveling
from
the
one
to
the
other
we
agreed
it
might
be
at
least
it
fitted
with
the
violet
and
the
alamos
blue
being
brighter
than
the
other
colors
i
just
hope
we
got
some
sort
of
radar
i
said
i
guessed
we
had
because
twice
we
jogged
in
our
course
a
little
maybe
to
clear
the
alleghenies
the
easterly
green
star
was
by
now
getting
pretty
close
to
the
violet
blot
of
i
looked
out
at
the
orange
soup
which
was
thing
that
had
changed
a
bit
so
far
and
i
got
to
wishing
like
a
baby
that
it
was
there
and
to
thinking
how
it
blanketed
the
whole
earth
stars
over
the
riviera
do
make
me
laugh
and
i
heard
myself
asking
pop
did
you
rub
out
that
guy
that
pushed
the
buttons
for
all
this
nope
pop
answered
without
hesitation
just
as
if
it
had
been
four
hours
or
so
since
he
mentioned
the
point
nope
ray
fact
is
i
welcomed
him
into
our
little
fellowship
about
six
months
back
this
is
knife
here
this
in
my
boot
though
he
never
killed
with
it
he
claimed
he
been
tortured
for
years
by
the
thought
of
the
millions
and
millions
he
killed
with
blast
and
radiation
but
now
he
was
finding
peace
at
last
because
he
was
where
he
belonged
with
the
murderers
and
could
start
to
do
something
about
it
several
of
the
boys
did
want
to
let
him
in
they
claimed
he
was
a
real
murderer
doing
it
by
remote
control
no
matter
how
many
he
bumped
off
i
have
been
on
their
side
alice
said
thinning
her
lips
yep
pop
continued
they
got
real
hot
about
it
got
hot
too
and
all
excited
and
offered
to
go
out
and
kill
somebody
with
his
bare
hands
right
off
or
try
to
he
a
skinny
little
runt
if
that
what
he
had
to
do
to
join
we
argued
it
over
i
pointed
out
that
we
let
count
the
killings
they
done
in
service
and
that
we
counted
poisonings
and
booby
traps
and
such
too
which
are
killings
in
a
way
so
eventually
we
let
him
in
he
doing
good
work
we
fortunate
to
have
him
do
you
think
he
really
the
guy
who
pushed
the
buttons
i
asked
pop
how
should
i
know
pop
replied
he
claims
to
be
i
was
going
to
say
something
about
people
who
faked
confessions
to
get
a
little
easy
glory
as
compared
to
the
guys
who
were
really
guilty
and
would
sooner
be
chopped
up
than
talk
about
it
but
at
that
moment
a
fourth
voice
started
talking
in
the
plane
it
seemed
to
be
coming
out
of
the
violet
patch
on
the
north
america
screen
that
is
it
came
from
the
general
direction
of
the
screen
at
any
rate
and
my
mind
instantly
tied
it
to
the
violet
patch
at
it
gave
us
a
fright
i
can
tell
you
alice
grabbed
my
knee
with
her
pliers
she
changed
again
harder
than
she
intended
i
suppose
though
i
did
let
out
a
yip
i
was
too
defensively
frozen
the
voice
was
talking
a
language
i
did
understand
at
all
that
went
up
and
down
the
scale
like
atonal
music
sounds
like
chinese
pop
whispered
giving
me
a
nudge
it
chinese
mandarin
the
screen
responded
instantly
in
the
purest
english
at
least
that
was
how
i
describe
it
practically
boston
who
are
you
and
where
is
grayl
come
in
grayl
i
knew
well
enough
who
grayl
must
be
or
rather
have
been
i
looked
at
pop
and
alice
pop
grinned
maybe
a
mite
feebly
this
time
i
thought
and
gave
me
a
look
as
if
to
say
want
to
handle
it
i
cleared
my
throat
then
we
taken
over
for
grayl
i
said
to
the
screen
oh
the
screen
hesitated
just
barely
then
do
any
of
speak
mandarin
i
hardly
bothered
to
look
at
pop
and
alice
no
i
said
oh
again
a
tiny
pause
is
grayl
aboard
the
plane
no
i
said
oh
incapacitated
in
some
way
i
suppose
yes
i
said
grateful
for
the
screen
tactfulness
unintentional
or
not
but
you
have
taken
over
for
him
the
screen
pressed
yes
i
said
swallowing
i
did
know
what
i
was
getting
us
into
things
were
moving
too
fast
but
it
seemed
the
merest
sense
to
act
cooperative
i
very
glad
of
that
the
screen
said
with
something
in
its
tone
that
made
me
feel
funny
i
guess
it
was
sincerity
then
it
said
is
the
and
hesitated
and
started
again
with
are
the
blocks
aboard
i
thought
alice
pointed
at
the
stuff
she
dumped
out
of
the
other
seat
i
said
there
a
box
with
a
thousand
or
so
underweight
steel
cubes
in
it
like
a
child
blocks
but
with
buttons
in
them
alongside
a
box
with
a
parachute
that
what
i
mean
the
screen
said
and
somehow
maybe
because
whoever
was
talking
was
trying
to
hide
it
i
caught
a
note
of
great
relief
look
the
screen
said
more
rapidly
now
i
do
know
how
much
you
know
but
we
may
have
to
work
very
fast
you
are
going
to
be
able
to
deliver
the
steel
cubes
to
us
directly
in
fact
you
are
going
to
be
able
to
land
in
atlantic
highlands
at
all
we
sieged
in
by
planes
and
ground
forces
of
savannah
fortress
all
our
aircraft
such
as
been
destroyed
are
pinned
down
you
going
to
have
to
parachute
the
blocks
to
a
point
as
near
as
possible
to
one
of
our
ground
parties
that
made
a
sortie
we
give
you
a
signal
i
hope
it
will
be
later
nearer
here
that
is
but
it
may
be
sooner
do
you
know
how
to
fight
the
plane
you
in
operate
its
armament
no
i
said
wetting
my
lip
then
that
the
first
thing
i
best
teach
you
anything
you
see
in
the
haze
from
now
on
will
be
from
savannah
you
must
shoot
it
down
chapter
we
are
here
as
on
a
darkling
plain
swept
with
confused
alarms
of
struggle
and
flight
where
ignorant
armies
clash
by
dover
beach
matthew
i
am
not
going
to
try
to
describe
point
by
point
all
that
happened
the
next
half
hour
because
there
was
too
much
of
it
and
it
involved
all
three
of
us
sometimes
doing
different
things
at
the
same
time
and
although
we
were
told
a
lot
of
things
we
were
seldom
if
ever
told
the
why
of
them
and
through
it
all
was
the
constant
impression
that
we
were
dealing
with
human
beings
i
almost
left
out
the
human
and
still
not
absolutely
sure
whether
i
should
of
vastly
greater
scope
and
probably
intelligence
too
than
ourselves
and
that
was
just
the
confusion
to
give
it
a
name
after
a
while
the
situation
got
more
difficult
as
i
try
to
tell
in
due
course
to
begin
with
it
was
extremely
weird
to
plunge
from
a
rather
leisurely
confab
about
a
fellowship
of
murderers
into
a
shooting
war
between
a
violet
blob
and
a
dark
red
puddle
on
a
shadowy
fluorescent
map
the
voice
did
throw
any
great
shining
lights
on
this
topic
because
after
the
first
and
perhaps
unguarded
revelation
we
learned
little
more
of
the
war
between
and
savannah
fortress
and
nothing
of
the
reasons
behind
it
presumably
savannah
was
the
aggressor
reaching
out
north
after
the
conquest
of
birmingham
but
even
that
was
just
a
guess
it
is
hard
to
describe
how
shadowy
it
all
felt
to
me
there
were
some
minutes
while
my
mind
kept
mixing
up
the
whole
thing
with
what
i
read
long
ago
about
the
civil
war
savannah
was
lee
was
grant
and
we
had
been
dropped
spang
into
the
middle
of
the
second
battle
of
the
wilderness
apparently
the
savannah
planes
had
some
sort
of
needle
ray
as
part
of
their
armament
at
any
rate
i
was
warned
to
watch
out
for
swinging
lines
in
the
haze
like
straight
strings
of
pink
stars
and
later
told
to
aim
at
the
sources
of
such
lines
and
naturally
i
guessed
that
the
steel
cubes
must
be
some
crucial
weapon
for
or
ammunition
for
a
weapon
or
parts
for
some
essential
instrument
like
a
giant
computer
but
the
voice
ignored
my
questions
on
that
point
and
did
fall
into
the
couple
of
crude
conversational
traps
i
tried
to
set
we
were
to
drop
the
cubes
when
told
that
was
all
pop
had
the
box
of
them
closed
again
and
rigged
to
the
parachute
he
took
over
that
job
because
alice
and
me
were
busy
with
other
things
when
the
instructions
on
that
came
through
and
he
was
told
how
to
open
the
door
of
the
plane
for
the
drop
you
just
held
your
hand
steadily
on
a
point
beside
the
door
but
as
i
say
that
was
all
naturally
it
occurred
to
me
that
once
we
had
made
the
drop
would
have
no
more
use
for
us
and
might
simply
let
us
be
destroyed
by
savannah
or
otherwise
perhaps
us
to
be
destroyed
so
that
it
might
be
wisest
for
us
to
refuse
to
make
the
drop
when
the
signal
came
and
hang
onto
those
myriad
steel
cubes
as
our
only
bargaining
point
still
i
could
see
no
advantage
to
refusing
the
signal
came
i
have
liked
to
discuss
the
point
with
alice
and
maybe
pop
too
but
apparently
everything
we
said
even
whispered
could
be
overheard
by
we
never
did
determine
incidentally
whether
could
into
the
cabin
of
the
plane
also
i
do
believe
they
could
though
they
sure
had
it
bugged
for
sound
all
in
all
we
found
out
almost
nothing
about
in
fact
three
witless
germs
traveling
in
a
cabin
in
an
iron
filing
was
a
bad
description
of
us
at
all
as
i
often
say
of
my
deductive
faculties
think
shmink
but
always
meaning
of
course
the
personality
behind
the
voice
from
the
screen
found
out
all
it
wanted
about
us
and
apparently
knew
a
good
deal
to
start
with
for
one
thing
they
must
have
been
tracking
our
plane
for
some
time
because
they
guessed
it
was
on
automatic
and
that
we
could
reverse
its
course
but
nothing
else
though
they
seemed
under
the
impression
that
we
could
reverse
its
course
to
los
alamos
not
the
cracking
plant
here
obviously
i
did
get
a
nugget
of
new
data
though
it
was
just
about
the
only
one
for
a
moment
the
voice
from
the
screen
got
real
unguarded
anxious
as
it
asked
do
you
know
if
it
is
true
that
they
have
stopped
dying
at
los
alamos
or
are
they
merely
broadcasting
that
to
cheer
us
up
i
answered
oh
yes
they
all
fine
to
that
but
i
could
have
made
it
very
convincing
because
the
next
thing
i
knew
the
voice
was
getting
me
to
admit
that
we
only
boarded
the
plane
somewhere
in
the
central
deathlands
i
even
had
to
describe
the
cracking
plant
and
freeway
and
gas
tanks
i
could
think
of
a
lie
that
might
get
us
into
as
much
trouble
as
the
truth
and
the
voice
said
oh
did
grayl
stay
there
and
i
said
yes
and
braced
myself
to
do
some
more
admitting
or
some
heavy
lying
as
the
inspiration
took
me
but
the
voice
continued
to
skirt
around
the
question
of
what
exactly
had
happened
to
grayl
i
guess
they
knew
well
enough
we
bumped
him
off
but
did
bring
it
up
because
they
needed
our
cooperation
they
were
handling
us
like
children
or
savages
you
see
one
pretty
amazing
point
apparently
knew
something
about
fellowship
of
murderers
because
when
he
had
to
speak
up
while
he
was
getting
instructions
on
preparing
the
stuff
for
the
drop
the
voice
said
excuse
me
but
you
sound
like
one
of
those
a
boys
murderers
anonymous
pop
had
said
some
of
their
boys
called
their
unorganized
organization
yep
i
am
pop
admitted
uncomfortably
well
a
word
of
advice
then
or
perhaps
i
only
mean
gossip
the
screen
said
for
once
getting
on
a
side
track
most
of
our
people
do
not
believe
you
are
serious
about
it
although
you
may
think
that
you
are
our
skeptics
which
includes
all
but
a
very
few
of
us
split
quite
evenly
between
those
who
think
that
the
spirit
is
a
terminal
psychotic
illusion
and
those
who
believe
it
is
an
elaborate
ruse
in
preparation
for
some
concerted
attack
on
cities
by
deathlanders
ca
say
that
i
blame
the
either
of
them
was
pop
only
comment
i
think
i
nuts
myself
and
a
murderer
forever
alice
glared
at
him
for
that
admission
but
it
seemed
to
do
us
no
damage
pop
really
did
seem
out
of
his
depth
though
during
this
part
of
our
adventure
more
out
of
his
depth
than
even
alice
and
me
i
mean
as
if
he
could
only
really
function
in
the
deathland
with
deathlanders
and
wanted
to
get
anything
else
over
quickly
i
think
one
reason
pop
was
that
way
was
that
he
was
feeling
very
intensely
something
i
was
feeling
myself
a
sort
of
sadness
and
bewilderment
that
beings
as
smart
as
the
voice
from
the
screen
sounded
should
still
be
fighting
wars
murder
as
you
must
know
by
now
i
can
understand
and
sympathize
with
deeply
but
war
no
oh
i
can
understand
cultural
queers
fighting
city
squares
and
even
get
a
kick
out
of
it
and
whoop
on
but
these
and
alamos
folk
seemed
a
different
sort
of
cat
altogether
though
i
only
come
to
that
point
of
view
today
the
kind
of
cat
that
ought
to
have
outgrown
war
or
thought
its
way
around
it
maybe
savannah
fortress
had
simply
forced
the
war
on
them
and
they
had
to
defend
themselves
i
had
contacted
any
savannans
they
might
be
as
as
the
porterites
still
i
do
know
that
it
always
a
good
excuse
that
somebody
else
forced
you
into
war
that
sort
of
justification
can
keep
on
until
the
end
of
time
but
who
a
germ
to
judge
a
minute
later
i
was
feeling
doubly
like
a
germ
and
a
very
lowly
one
because
the
situation
had
just
got
more
difficult
and
depressing
too
the
thing
had
happened
that
i
said
i
tell
you
about
in
due
course
the
voice
was
just
repeating
its
instructions
to
pop
on
making
the
drop
when
it
broke
off
of
a
sudden
and
a
second
voice
came
in
a
deep
voice
with
a
sort
of
european
accent
not
chinese
oddly
not
talking
us
i
think
but
to
the
first
voice
and
overlooking
or
not
caring
that
we
could
hear
tell
them
the
second
voice
said
that
we
will
blow
them
out
of
the
sky
the
instant
they
stop
obeying
us
if
they
should
hesitate
to
make
the
drop
or
if
they
should
put
a
finger
on
the
button
that
reverses
their
course
then
such
brutes
understand
only
the
language
of
force
warn
them
that
the
blocks
are
atomic
grenades
that
will
blow
them
out
of
the
sky
too
if
kovalsky
will
you
permit
me
to
point
out
the
first
voice
interrupted
getting
as
close
to
expressing
irritation
as
i
imagine
it
ever
allowed
itself
to
do
then
both
voices
cut
off
abruptly
and
the
screen
was
silent
for
ten
seconds
or
so
i
guess
the
first
voice
thought
it
was
nice
for
us
to
overhear
bickering
with
itself
even
if
the
second
voice
did
give
a
damn
any
more
than
a
farmer
would
mind
the
pigs
overhearing
him
squabble
with
his
hired
man
of
course
this
guy
seemed
to
overlook
that
we
were
but
there
was
anything
we
could
do
in
that
line
just
now
except
get
burned
up
when
the
screen
came
on
again
it
was
just
the
first
voice
talking
once
more
but
it
had
something
to
say
that
was
probably
the
result
of
a
rapid
conference
and
compromise
attention
everyone
i
wish
to
inform
you
that
the
plane
in
which
you
are
traveling
can
be
exploded
melted
in
the
air
rather
if
we
activate
a
certain
control
at
this
end
we
will
do
so
now
or
subsequently
if
you
make
the
drop
when
we
give
the
signal
and
if
you
remain
on
your
present
course
until
then
afterwards
you
will
be
at
liberty
to
reverse
your
course
and
escape
as
best
you
may
let
me
that
when
you
told
me
you
had
taken
over
for
grayl
i
accepted
that
assertion
in
full
faith
and
still
so
accept
it
is
that
all
fully
understood
we
all
told
him
yes
though
i
do
imagine
we
sounded
very
happy
about
it
even
pop
however
i
did
get
that
funny
feeling
again
that
the
voice
was
being
really
sincere
an
illusion
i
supposed
but
still
a
comforting
one
now
while
all
these
things
were
going
on
believe
it
or
not
and
while
the
plane
continued
to
bullet
through
the
orange
haze
which
shown
any
foreign
objects
in
it
so
far
thank
god
even
vultures
let
alone
straight
strings
of
pink
stars
i
was
receiving
a
cram
course
in
gunnery
do
you
wonder
i
do
try
to
tell
this
part
of
my
story
consecutively
it
turned
out
that
alice
had
been
brilliantly
right
about
one
thing
if
you
pushed
some
of
the
buttons
simultaneously
in
patterns
of
five
they
unlocked
and
you
could
play
on
them
like
organ
keys
two
sets
of
five
keys
played
properly
would
rig
out
a
sight
just
in
front
of
the
viewport
and
let
you
aim
and
fire
the
plane
main
gun
in
any
forward
direction
there
was
a
rearward
firing
gun
too
that
you
aimed
by
changing
over
the
world
screen
to
a
tv
window
but
we
get
around
to
mastering
that
one
in
fact
in
spite
of
my
special
talents
it
was
all
i
could
do
to
achieve
a
beginner
control
over
the
main
gun
and
i
would
have
managed
even
that
except
that
alice
from
the
thinking
she
been
doing
about
patterns
of
five
was
quick
at
understanding
from
the
voice
descriptions
which
buttons
were
meant
she
could
work
them
herself
of
course
what
with
her
stump
and
burnt
hand
but
she
could
point
them
out
for
me
after
twenty
minutes
of
drill
i
was
a
gunner
of
sorts
sprawled
in
the
kneeling
seat
and
intently
scanning
the
onrushing
orange
haze
which
at
last
was
beginning
to
change
toward
the
bronze
of
evening
if
something
showed
up
in
it
i
be
able
to
make
a
stab
at
getting
a
shot
in
not
that
i
knew
what
my
gun
fired
the
voice
was
giving
away
any
unnecessary
data
naturally
i
had
asked
why
did
the
voice
teach
me
to
fly
the
plane
so
that
i
could
maneuver
in
case
of
attack
and
naturally
the
voice
had
told
me
it
was
out
of
the
question
much
too
difficult
and
besides
they
wanted
us
on
a
known
course
so
they
could
plan
better
for
the
drop
and
recovery
i
think
maybe
the
voice
would
have
given
me
some
hints
and
maybe
even
told
me
more
about
the
steel
cubes
too
and
how
much
danger
we
were
in
from
them
if
it
had
been
for
the
second
voice
which
presumably
had
issued
from
a
being
who
was
keeping
watch
to
make
sure
among
other
things
that
the
first
voice
did
get
so
there
i
was
being
a
front
gunner
actually
a
part
of
me
was
getting
a
big
bang
out
of
it
from
antique
banker
special
to
needle
cannon
or
whatever
it
was
but
at
the
same
time
another
part
of
me
was
disgusted
with
the
idea
of
acting
like
i
belonged
to
a
live
culture
even
a
smart
unqueer
one
and
working
in
a
war
even
just
so
as
to
get
out
of
it
fast
while
a
third
part
of
me
one
that
i
normally
keep
down
was
very
simply
horrified
pop
was
back
by
the
door
with
the
box
and
ready
to
make
the
drop
alice
had
no
duties
for
the
moment
but
she
suddenly
started
gathering
up
food
cans
and
packing
them
in
one
bag
i
could
figure
out
at
first
what
she
had
in
mind
orderly
housewife
would
be
exactly
my
description
of
her
occupational
personality
then
of
course
everything
had
to
happen
at
once
the
voice
said
make
the
drop
alice
crossed
to
pop
and
thrust
out
the
bag
of
cans
toward
him
writhing
her
lips
in
silent
talk
to
tell
him
something
she
had
a
knife
in
her
burnt
hand
too
but
i
did
have
time
to
do
any
because
just
then
a
glittering
pink
asterisk
showed
up
in
the
darkening
haze
ahead
a
whole
half
dozen
straight
lines
spreading
out
from
a
blank
central
spot
as
if
a
gigantic
spider
had
laid
in
the
first
strands
of
its
web
wind
whistled
as
the
door
of
the
plane
started
to
open
i
fought
to
center
my
sight
on
the
blank
central
spot
which
drifted
toward
the
left
one
of
the
straight
lines
grew
dazzlingly
bright
i
heard
alice
whisper
fiercely
drop
and
the
part
of
my
mind
that
could
be
applied
to
gunnery
instantly
deduced
that
she
had
some
inspiration
about
dropping
a
bunch
of
cans
instead
of
the
steel
cubes
i
got
the
sight
centered
and
held
down
the
firing
combo
the
thought
flashed
to
me
a
city
you
firing
at
not
a
and
i
flinched
the
dazzlingly
pink
line
dipped
down
toward
me
behind
me
the
sound
of
a
struggle
alice
snarling
and
pop
giving
a
grunt
then
all
at
once
a
scream
from
alice
a
big
whoosh
of
wind
a
flash
way
ahead
where
i
aimed
a
spatter
of
hot
metal
inside
the
cabin
a
blinding
spot
in
the
middle
of
the
world
screen
a
searing
beam
inches
from
my
neck
an
electric
shock
that
lifted
me
from
my
seat
and
ripped
at
my
consciousness
when
i
came
to
if
i
really
ever
was
out
seconds
later
at
most
there
were
no
more
pink
lines
the
haze
was
just
its
disgustingly
tawny
evening
self
with
black
spots
that
were
only
the
cabin
stunk
of
ozone
but
wind
funneling
through
a
hole
in
the
world
screen
was
blowing
it
out
fast
enough
savannah
had
gotten
in
one
lick
all
right
and
we
were
falling
the
plane
was
swinging
down
like
a
crippled
bird
i
could
feel
it
and
there
was
no
use
kidding
myself
but
staring
at
the
control
panel
would
keep
us
from
crashing
if
that
was
in
the
cards
i
looked
around
and
there
were
pop
and
alice
glaring
at
each
other
across
the
closing
door
he
looked
mean
she
looked
agonized
and
was
pressing
her
burnt
hand
into
her
side
with
her
elbow
as
if
he
stamped
on
the
hand
maybe
i
did
see
any
blood
though
i
did
see
the
box
and
either
though
i
did
see
alice
bag
of
groceries
i
guessed
pop
had
made
the
drop
now
it
occurred
to
me
was
a
bully
time
for
voice
two
to
melt
the
plane
if
he
had
already
tried
my
first
thought
had
been
that
the
spatter
of
hot
metal
had
come
from
the
savannah
craft
spitting
us
but
there
was
no
way
to
be
sure
i
looked
around
at
the
viewport
in
time
to
see
rocks
and
stunted
trees
jump
out
of
the
haze
old
i
thought
in
at
the
but
just
then
the
plane
took
a
sickening
bounce
as
if
its
antigravity
had
only
started
to
operate
within
yards
of
the
ground
another
lurching
fall
and
another
bounce
less
violent
a
couple
of
repetitions
of
that
each
one
a
little
gentler
and
then
we
were
sort
of
bumping
along
on
an
even
keel
with
the
rocks
and
such
sliding
past
fast
about
a
hundred
feet
below
i
judged
we
been
spoiled
for
altitude
work
it
seemed
but
we
could
still
cripple
along
in
some
sort
of
repulsion
field
i
looked
at
the
north
america
screen
and
the
buttons
wondering
if
i
should
start
us
back
west
again
or
leave
us
set
on
and
see
what
the
hell
happened
at
the
moment
i
hardly
cared
what
else
savannah
did
to
us
i
need
have
wasted
the
mental
energy
the
decision
was
made
for
me
as
i
watched
the
button
jumped
up
by
itself
and
the
button
for
the
cracking
plant
went
down
and
there
was
some
extra
bumping
as
we
swung
around
also
the
violet
patch
of
went
real
dim
and
the
button
for
it
no
longer
had
a
violet
nimbus
the
los
alamos
blue
went
dull
too
the
dot
glowed
a
brighter
green
that
was
all
all
except
for
one
thing
as
the
violet
dimmed
i
thought
i
heard
voice
one
very
faintly
not
as
if
speaking
directly
but
as
if
the
screen
had
heard
and
remembered
not
a
voice
but
the
fluorescent
ghost
of
one
thank
you
and
good
luck
chapter
a
man
has
dated
his
ruin
from
some
murder
or
other
that
perhaps
he
thought
little
of
at
the
thomas
de
quincey
and
a
long
merry
siege
to
you
sir
and
roast
rat
for
christmas
i
responded
very
out
loud
and
rather
to
my
surprise
war
how
i
hate
war
that
was
what
pop
exploded
with
he
exactly
dance
in
senile
rage
he
was
still
keeping
too
sharp
a
watch
on
alice
but
his
voice
sounded
that
way
damn
you
pop
alice
contributed
and
you
too
ray
we
might
have
pulled
something
but
you
had
to
go
then
her
anger
got
the
better
of
her
grammar
or
maybe
pop
and
me
was
corrupting
it
damn
the
both
of
you
she
finished
it
did
make
much
sense
any
of
it
we
were
just
cutting
loose
i
guess
after
being
scared
to
say
anything
for
the
last
half
hour
i
said
to
alice
i
do
know
what
you
could
have
pulled
except
the
chain
on
us
to
pop
i
remarked
you
may
hate
war
but
you
sure
helped
that
one
along
those
grenades
you
dropped
will
probably
take
care
of
a
few
hundred
savannans
that
what
you
always
say
about
me
is
it
he
snapped
back
but
i
do
suppose
i
should
expect
any
kinder
interpretation
of
my
motives
to
alice
he
said
i
sorry
i
had
to
slap
your
burnt
fingers
sister
but
you
ca
say
i
did
warn
you
about
my
tactics
then
to
me
again
i
hate
war
ray
it
just
murder
on
a
bigger
scale
though
some
of
the
boys
give
me
an
argument
there
then
why
do
you
go
preach
against
war
in
and
savannah
alice
demanded
still
very
hot
but
not
quite
so
bitter
yeah
pop
how
about
it
i
seconded
maybe
i
should
he
said
thoughtful
all
at
once
they
sure
need
it
then
he
grinned
hey
how
this
sound
hear
the
murderer
pop
trumbull
talk
against
war
wear
your
steel
throat
protectors
pretty
good
hey
we
all
laughed
at
that
grudgingly
at
first
then
with
a
touch
of
wholeheartedness
i
think
we
all
recognized
that
things
were
going
to
be
very
cheerful
from
here
on
in
and
we
better
not
turn
up
our
noses
at
the
feeblest
fun
i
guess
i
did
have
anything
very
bright
in
mind
alice
admitted
to
me
while
to
pop
she
said
all
right
i
forgive
you
for
the
present
do
pop
said
with
a
shudder
i
hate
to
think
of
what
happened
to
the
last
bugger
made
the
mistake
of
forgiving
me
we
looked
around
and
took
stock
of
our
resources
it
was
time
we
did
it
was
getting
dark
fast
although
we
were
chasing
the
sun
and
there
were
any
cabin
lights
coming
on
and
we
sure
did
know
of
any
way
of
getting
any
we
wadded
a
couple
of
satchels
into
the
hole
in
the
world
screen
without
trying
to
probe
it
after
a
while
it
got
warmer
again
in
the
cabin
and
the
air
a
little
less
dusty
presently
it
started
to
get
too
smoky
from
the
cigarettes
we
were
burning
but
that
came
later
we
screwed
off
the
walls
the
few
storage
bags
we
had
inspected
they
did
contain
nothing
of
consequence
not
even
a
flashlight
i
had
one
last
go
at
the
buttons
though
there
were
any
left
with
nimbuses
on
them
the
darker
it
got
the
clearer
that
was
even
the
button
would
push
now
that
it
had
lost
its
violet
halo
i
tried
the
gunnery
patterns
figuring
to
put
in
a
little
time
taking
pot
shots
at
any
mountains
that
turned
up
but
the
buttons
that
had
been
responding
so
well
a
few
minutes
ago
refused
to
budge
alice
suggested
different
patterns
but
none
of
them
worked
that
console
was
really
locked
maybe
the
shot
from
savannah
was
partly
responsible
though
things
was
explanation
enough
the
buggers
i
said
they
did
have
to
tie
us
up
tight
going
east
we
at
least
had
a
choice
forward
or
back
now
we
got
none
maybe
we
just
as
well
off
pop
said
if
had
been
able
to
do
anything
more
for
us
that
is
if
they
had
been
sieged
in
i
mean
they
sure
as
anything
have
pulled
us
in
pull
the
plane
in
i
mean
and
picked
us
out
of
it
with
a
big
pair
of
tweezers
likely
as
not
and
contrary
to
your
flattering
opinion
of
my
preaching
which
by
the
way
none
of
the
religious
boys
in
my
outfit
share
they
call
me
misguided
old
atheist
i
do
think
none
of
us
would
go
over
big
at
we
had
to
agree
with
him
there
i
could
imagine
pop
or
alice
or
even
me
cutting
much
of
a
figure
even
if
we
were
with
the
pack
of
geniuses
that
seemed
to
make
up
the
crowd
the
republics
to
give
them
a
name
might
have
their
types
but
somehow
i
did
think
so
there
must
be
more
than
one
it
seemed
to
me
back
of
antigravity
and
all
the
wonders
in
this
plane
and
the
other
things
we
gotten
hints
of
also
grayl
had
seemed
bred
for
brains
as
well
as
size
even
if
us
small
mammals
had
cooked
his
goose
and
none
of
the
modern
countries
had
more
than
a
few
thousand
population
yet
i
was
pretty
sure
and
that
hardly
left
room
for
a
dumbbell
class
finally
too
i
got
hold
of
a
memory
i
been
reaching
for
the
last
hour
how
when
i
was
a
kid
read
about
some
scientists
who
learned
to
talk
mandarin
just
for
kicks
i
told
alice
and
pop
and
if
the
average
idea
of
mental
recreation
i
said
well
you
can
see
what
i
mean
i
grant
you
they
got
a
monopoly
of
brains
pop
agreed
not
sense
though
he
added
doggedly
intellectual
snobs
was
alice
comment
i
know
the
type
and
i
detest
it
you
sort
of
intellectual
are
you
pop
told
her
which
fortunately
did
start
a
riot
still
i
guess
all
three
of
us
found
it
fun
to
chew
over
a
bit
the
new
slant
we
gotten
on
two
in
a
way
three
of
the
great
countries
of
the
modern
world
and
as
long
as
we
thought
of
it
as
fun
we
have
to
admit
the
envy
and
wistfulness
that
was
behind
our
wisecracks
i
said
we
always
figured
in
a
general
way
that
alamos
was
the
remains
of
a
community
of
scientists
and
technicians
now
we
know
the
same
true
of
the
group
they
the
brookhaven
survivors
manhattan
project
do
you
mean
alice
corrected
nope
that
was
in
colorado
springs
pop
said
with
finality
i
also
pointed
out
that
a
community
of
scientists
would
educate
for
technical
intelligence
maybe
breed
for
it
too
and
being
a
group
picked
for
high
to
begin
with
they
might
make
startlingly
fast
progress
you
could
easily
imagine
such
folk
unimpeded
by
the
boobs
creating
a
wonder
world
in
a
couple
of
generations
they
got
their
troubles
though
pop
reminded
me
and
that
led
us
to
speculating
about
the
war
we
dipped
into
savannah
fortress
we
knew
was
supposed
to
be
based
on
some
big
atomic
plants
on
the
river
down
that
way
but
its
culture
seemed
to
have
a
fiercer
ingredient
than
before
we
knew
it
we
were
musing
almost
romantically
about
the
plight
of
besieged
by
superior
and
it
was
easy
to
suppose
barbaric
forces
and
maybe
distant
los
alamos
in
a
similar
predicament
alice
reminded
me
how
the
voice
had
asked
if
they
were
still
dying
out
there
for
a
moment
i
found
myself
fiercely
proud
that
i
had
been
able
to
strike
a
blow
against
evil
aggressors
at
once
of
course
then
the
revulsion
came
this
is
a
hell
of
a
way
i
said
for
three
realists
to
be
mooning
about
things
yes
especially
when
your
heroes
kicked
us
out
alice
agreed
pop
chuckled
yep
he
said
they
even
took
ray
artillery
away
from
him
you
wrong
there
pop
i
said
sitting
up
i
still
got
one
of
the
grenades
the
one
the
pilot
had
in
his
fist
to
tell
the
truth
forgotten
all
about
it
and
it
bothered
me
a
little
now
to
feel
it
snugged
up
in
my
pocket
against
my
hip
bone
where
the
skin
is
thin
you
believe
what
that
old
dutchman
said
about
the
steel
cubes
being
atomic
grenades
pop
asked
me
i
do
know
i
said
he
sure
did
sound
enthusiastic
about
telling
us
the
truth
about
anything
but
for
that
matter
he
sounded
mean
enough
to
tell
the
truth
figuring
we
think
it
was
a
lie
maybe
this
some
sort
of
baby
with
a
fuse
timed
like
a
grenade
i
got
it
out
and
hefted
it
how
about
i
press
the
button
and
drop
it
out
the
door
then
we
know
i
really
felt
like
doing
it
restless
i
guess
do
be
a
fool
ray
alice
said
do
tense
up
i
wo
i
told
her
at
the
same
time
i
made
myself
the
little
promise
that
if
i
ever
got
to
feeling
restless
that
is
restless
and
i
just
go
ahead
and
punch
the
button
and
see
what
happened
sort
of
leave
my
future
up
to
the
gods
of
the
deathlands
you
might
say
what
makes
you
so
sure
it
a
weapon
pop
asked
what
else
would
it
be
i
asked
him
that
they
be
so
hot
on
getting
them
in
the
middle
of
a
war
i
do
know
for
sure
pop
said
i
made
a
guess
but
i
do
want
to
tell
it
now
what
i
getting
at
ray
is
that
your
first
thought
about
anything
you
find
in
the
world
outside
or
in
your
own
mind
is
that
it
a
weapon
anything
worthwhile
in
your
mind
is
a
weapon
alice
interjected
with
surprising
intensity
you
see
pop
said
that
what
i
mean
about
the
both
of
you
that
sort
of
thinking
been
going
on
a
long
time
cave
man
picks
up
a
rock
and
right
away
asks
himself
can
i
brain
with
this
does
occur
to
him
for
several
hundred
thousand
years
to
use
it
to
start
building
a
hospital
you
know
pop
i
said
carefully
tucking
the
cube
back
in
my
pocket
you
sort
of
preachy
at
times
guess
i
am
he
said
how
about
some
grub
it
was
a
good
idea
another
few
minutes
and
we
would
have
been
able
to
see
to
eat
though
with
the
cans
shaped
to
tell
their
contents
i
guess
we
have
managed
it
was
a
funny
circumstance
that
in
this
wonder
plane
we
did
even
know
how
to
turn
on
the
light
and
a
good
measure
of
our
general
helplessness
we
had
our
little
feed
and
lit
up
again
and
settled
ourselves
i
judged
it
would
be
an
overnight
trip
at
least
to
the
cracking
plant
we
were
making
anything
like
the
speed
we
had
been
going
east
pop
was
sitting
in
back
again
and
alice
and
i
lay
half
hitched
around
on
the
kneeling
seats
which
allowed
us
to
watch
each
other
pretty
soon
it
got
so
dark
we
could
see
anything
of
each
other
but
the
glowing
tips
of
the
cigarettes
and
a
bit
of
face
around
the
mouth
when
the
person
took
a
deep
drag
they
were
a
good
idea
those
cigarettes
kept
us
from
having
ideas
about
the
other
person
starting
to
creep
around
with
a
knife
in
his
hand
the
north
america
screen
still
glowed
dimly
and
we
could
watch
our
green
dot
trying
to
make
progress
the
viewport
was
dead
black
at
first
then
there
came
the
faintest
sort
of
bronze
blotch
that
very
slowly
shifted
forward
and
down
the
old
moon
of
course
going
west
ahead
of
us
after
a
while
i
realized
what
it
was
like
an
old
pullman
car
traveled
in
one
once
as
a
kid
or
especially
the
smoker
of
an
old
pullman
very
late
at
night
our
crippled
antigravity
working
on
the
irregularities
of
the
ground
as
they
came
along
below
made
the
ride
rhythmically
bumpy
you
see
i
remembered
how
lonely
and
strange
that
old
sleeping
car
had
seemed
to
me
as
a
kid
this
felt
the
same
i
kept
waiting
for
a
hoot
or
a
whistle
it
was
the
sort
of
loneliness
that
settles
in
your
bones
and
keeps
working
at
you
i
recall
the
first
man
i
ever
killed
pop
started
to
reminisce
softly
shut
up
alice
told
him
do
you
ever
talk
about
anything
but
murder
pop
guess
not
he
said
after
all
it
the
only
really
interesting
topic
there
is
do
you
know
of
another
it
was
silent
in
the
cabin
for
a
long
time
after
that
then
alice
said
it
was
the
afternoon
before
my
twelfth
birthday
when
they
came
into
the
kitchen
and
killed
my
father
he
been
wise
in
a
way
and
had
us
living
at
a
spot
where
the
bombs
did
touch
us
or
the
worst
fallout
but
he
had
counted
on
the
local
werewolf
gang
he
just
been
slicing
some
bread
homemade
from
our
own
wheat
dad
was
great
on
back
to
nature
and
all
but
he
laid
down
the
knife
dad
could
see
any
object
or
idea
as
a
weapon
you
see
that
was
his
great
weakness
dad
could
even
see
weapons
as
weapons
dad
had
a
philosophy
of
cooperation
that
was
his
name
for
it
that
he
was
going
to
explain
to
people
sometimes
i
think
he
was
glad
of
the
last
war
because
he
believed
it
would
give
him
his
chance
but
the
werewolves
were
interested
in
philosophy
and
although
their
knives
were
as
sharp
as
dad
they
did
lay
them
down
afterwards
they
had
themselves
a
meal
with
me
for
dessert
i
remember
one
of
them
used
a
slice
of
bread
to
sop
up
blood
like
gravy
and
another
washed
his
hands
and
face
in
the
cold
coffee
she
did
say
anything
else
for
a
bit
pop
said
softly
that
was
the
afternoon
was
it
that
the
fallen
angels
and
then
just
said
my
big
mouth
you
were
going
to
say
afternoon
they
killed
god
alice
asked
him
you
right
it
was
they
killed
god
in
the
kitchen
that
afternoon
that
how
i
know
he
dead
afterwards
they
would
have
killed
me
too
eventually
except
again
she
broke
off
this
time
to
say
pop
do
you
suppose
i
can
have
been
thinking
about
myself
as
the
daughter
of
god
all
these
years
that
that
why
everything
seems
so
intense
i
do
know
pop
said
the
religious
boys
say
we
all
children
of
god
i
do
put
much
stock
in
it
or
else
god
sure
has
some
lousy
children
go
on
with
your
story
well
they
would
have
killed
me
too
except
the
leader
took
a
fancy
to
me
and
got
the
idea
of
training
me
up
for
a
weregirl
or
deb
or
whatever
they
called
it
that
was
my
first
experience
of
ideas
as
weapons
he
got
an
idea
about
me
and
i
used
it
to
kill
him
i
had
to
wait
three
months
for
my
opportunity
i
got
him
so
lazy
he
let
me
shave
him
he
bled
to
death
the
same
way
as
dad
hum
pop
commented
after
a
bit
that
was
a
chiller
all
right
i
got
to
remember
to
tell
it
to
bill
it
was
somebody
killing
his
mother
that
got
started
alice
you
had
about
as
good
a
justification
for
your
first
murder
as
any
i
remember
hearing
yet
alice
said
after
another
pause
with
just
a
trace
of
the
old
sarcasm
creeping
back
into
her
voice
i
do
suppose
you
think
i
was
right
to
do
it
right
wrong
who
knows
pop
said
almost
blusteringly
sure
you
were
justified
in
a
whole
pack
of
ways
anybody
sympathize
with
you
a
man
often
has
fine
justification
for
the
first
murder
he
commits
but
as
you
must
know
it
not
that
the
first
murder
always
so
bad
in
itself
as
that
it
apt
to
start
you
on
a
killing
spree
your
sense
of
values
gets
shifted
a
tiny
bit
and
never
shifts
back
but
you
know
all
that
and
who
am
i
to
tell
you
anything
anyway
i
killed
men
because
i
did
like
the
way
they
spit
and
may
very
well
do
it
again
if
i
do
keep
watching
myself
and
my
mind
ventilated
well
pop
alice
said
i
did
always
have
such
dandy
justification
for
my
killings
last
one
was
a
moony
old
physicist
he
fixed
me
the
geiger
counter
i
carry
a
silly
old
geek
i
do
know
how
he
survived
so
long
maybe
an
exile
or
a
runaway
you
know
i
often
attach
myself
to
the
elderly
type
like
my
father
was
or
like
you
pop
pop
nodded
it
good
to
know
yourself
he
said
there
was
a
third
pause
and
then
although
i
had
exactly
been
intending
to
i
said
alice
had
justification
for
her
first
murder
personal
justification
that
an
ape
would
understand
i
had
no
personal
justification
at
all
for
mine
yet
i
killed
about
a
million
people
at
a
modest
estimate
you
see
i
was
the
boss
of
the
crew
that
took
care
of
the
hydrogen
missile
ticketed
for
moscow
and
when
the
ticket
was
finally
taken
up
i
was
the
one
to
punch
it
my
finger
on
the
firing
button
i
mean
i
went
on
yeah
pop
i
was
one
of
the
there
were
really
quite
a
few
of
us
of
course
that
why
i
get
such
a
laugh
out
of
stories
about
being
or
rubbing
out
the
guy
who
pushed
all
the
buttons
that
so
pop
said
with
only
interest
in
that
case
you
ought
to
know
we
did
get
to
hear
right
then
who
i
ought
to
know
because
i
had
a
fit
of
coughing
and
we
realized
the
cigarette
smoke
was
getting
just
too
thick
pop
fixed
the
door
so
it
was
open
a
crack
and
after
a
while
the
atmosphere
got
reasonably
okay
though
we
had
to
put
up
with
a
low
lonely
whistling
sound
yeah
i
continued
i
was
the
boss
of
the
missile
crew
and
i
wore
a
very
handsome
uniform
with
impressive
insignia
not
the
bully
old
stripes
i
got
on
my
chest
now
and
i
was
very
young
and
handsome
myself
we
were
all
very
young
in
that
line
of
service
though
a
few
of
the
men
under
me
were
a
little
older
young
and
dedicated
i
remember
feeling
a
very
deep
and
grim
and
responsibility
but
i
wonder
sometimes
just
how
deep
it
went
or
how
clean
it
really
was
i
had
an
uncle
flew
in
the
war
they
fought
to
lick
fascism
bombardier
on
a
flying
fortress
or
something
and
once
when
he
got
drunk
he
told
me
how
some
days
it
did
bother
him
at
all
to
drop
the
eggs
on
germany
the
buildings
and
people
down
there
seemed
just
like
toys
that
a
kid
sets
up
to
kick
over
and
the
whole
business
about
as
naive
fun
as
poking
an
anthill
did
even
have
to
fly
over
at
seven
miles
what
i
was
going
to
be
aiming
at
only
i
remember
sometimes
getting
out
a
map
and
looking
at
a
certain
large
dot
on
it
and
smiling
a
little
and
softly
saying
and
then
giving
a
little
conventional
shudder
and
folding
up
the
map
quick
naturally
we
told
ourselves
we
never
have
to
do
it
fire
the
thing
i
mean
we
joked
about
how
after
twenty
years
or
so
we
all
be
given
jobs
as
museum
attendants
of
this
same
bomb
deactivated
at
last
but
naturally
it
did
work
out
that
way
there
came
the
day
when
our
side
of
the
world
got
hit
and
the
orders
started
cascading
down
from
defense
coordinator
bigelow
bigelow
pop
interrupted
not
joe
bigelow
joseph
i
believe
i
told
him
a
little
annoyed
why
he
my
boy
then
the
one
i
was
telling
you
about
the
skinny
runt
had
this
can
you
beat
that
pop
sounded
startlingly
happy
him
and
you
have
a
lot
to
talk
about
when
you
get
together
i
was
so
sure
of
that
myself
in
fact
my
first
reaction
was
that
the
opposite
would
be
true
to
be
honest
i
was
for
the
first
moment
more
than
a
little
annoyed
at
pop
interrupting
my
story
of
my
big
grief
for
it
was
that
to
me
make
no
mistake
here
my
story
had
finally
been
teased
out
of
me
against
all
expectation
after
decades
of
repression
and
in
spite
of
dozens
of
assorted
psychological
blocks
and
here
was
pop
interrupting
it
for
the
sake
of
a
lot
of
trivial
organizational
gossip
about
joes
and
bills
and
georges
we
never
heard
of
and
what
they
say
or
think
but
then
all
of
a
sudden
i
realized
that
i
did
really
care
that
it
did
feel
like
a
big
grief
any
more
that
just
starting
to
tell
about
it
after
hearing
pop
and
alice
tell
their
stories
had
purged
it
of
that
unnecessary
weight
of
feeling
that
had
made
it
a
millstone
around
my
neck
it
seemed
to
me
now
that
i
could
look
down
at
ray
baker
from
a
considerable
height
but
not
an
angelic
or
contemptuously
superior
height
and
ask
myself
why
he
had
grieved
so
much
that
was
understandable
and
even
desirable
but
why
he
had
grieved
so
in
such
a
stuffy
little
private
hell
and
it
be
interesting
to
find
out
how
joseph
bigelow
had
felt
how
does
it
feel
ray
to
kill
a
million
people
i
realized
that
alice
had
asked
me
the
question
several
seconds
back
and
it
was
hanging
in
the
air
that
just
what
i
been
trying
to
tell
you
i
told
her
and
started
to
explain
it
all
over
again
the
words
poured
out
of
me
now
i
put
them
down
here
it
would
take
too
long
but
they
were
honest
words
as
far
as
i
knew
and
they
eased
me
i
could
get
over
it
here
were
us
three
murderers
feeling
a
trust
and
understanding
and
sharing
a
communion
that
i
would
have
believed
possible
between
two
or
three
people
in
the
age
of
the
deaders
or
in
age
to
tell
the
truth
it
was
against
everything
i
knew
of
deathland
psychology
but
it
was
happening
just
the
same
oh
our
strange
isolation
had
something
to
do
with
it
i
knew
and
that
memory
hypnotizing
my
mind
and
our
reactions
to
the
voices
and
violence
of
but
in
spite
of
all
that
i
ranked
it
as
a
wonder
i
felt
an
inward
freedom
and
easiness
that
i
never
would
have
believed
possible
pop
little
disorganized
organization
had
really
got
hold
of
something
i
could
deny
it
three
treacherous
killers
talking
from
the
bottoms
of
their
hearts
and
believing
each
other
for
it
never
occurred
to
me
to
doubt
that
pop
and
alice
were
feeling
exactly
like
i
was
in
fact
we
were
all
so
sure
of
it
that
we
did
even
mention
our
communion
to
each
other
perhaps
we
were
a
little
afraid
we
would
rub
off
the
bloom
we
just
enjoyed
it
we
must
have
talked
about
a
thousand
things
that
night
and
smoked
a
couple
of
hundred
cigarettes
after
a
while
we
started
taking
little
catnaps
we
gotten
too
much
off
our
chests
and
come
to
feel
too
tranquil
for
even
our
excitement
to
keep
us
awake
i
remember
the
first
time
i
dozed
waking
up
with
a
cold
start
and
grabbing
for
mother
and
then
hearing
pop
and
alice
gabbing
in
the
dark
and
remembering
what
had
happened
and
relaxing
again
with
a
smile
of
all
things
pop
was
saying
yep
i
imagine
ray
must
be
good
to
make
love
to
murderers
almost
always
are
they
got
the
fire
it
reminds
me
of
what
a
guy
named
fred
told
me
one
of
our
boys
mostly
we
took
turns
going
to
sleep
though
i
think
there
were
times
when
all
three
of
us
were
snoozing
about
the
fifth
time
i
woke
up
after
some
tighter
the
orange
soup
was
back
again
outside
and
alice
was
snoring
gently
in
the
next
seat
and
pop
was
up
and
had
one
of
his
knives
out
he
was
looking
at
his
reflection
in
the
viewport
his
face
gleamed
he
was
rubbing
butter
into
it
another
day
another
pack
of
troubles
he
said
cheerfully
the
tone
of
his
remark
jangled
my
nerves
as
that
tone
generally
does
early
in
the
morning
i
squeezed
my
eyes
where
are
we
i
asked
he
poked
his
elbow
toward
the
north
america
screen
the
two
green
dots
were
almost
one
my
god
we
practically
there
alice
said
for
me
she
waked
fast
deathlands
style
i
know
pop
said
concentrating
on
what
he
was
doing
but
i
aim
to
be
shaved
before
they
commence
landing
maneuvers
you
think
automatic
will
land
us
alice
asked
what
if
we
just
start
circling
around
we
can
figure
out
what
to
do
when
it
happens
pop
said
whittling
away
at
his
chin
until
then
i
not
interested
there
still
a
couple
of
bottles
of
coffee
in
the
sack
i
had
mine
i
did
join
in
this
because
the
green
dots
and
alice
first
remark
had
reminded
me
of
a
lot
deeper
reason
for
my
jangled
nerves
than
pop
cheerfulness
night
was
gone
with
its
shielding
cloak
and
its
feeling
of
being
able
to
talk
forever
and
the
naked
day
was
here
with
its
demands
for
action
it
is
not
so
difficult
to
change
your
whole
view
of
life
when
you
are
flying
or
even
bumping
along
above
the
ground
with
friends
who
understand
but
soon
i
knew
i
be
down
in
the
dust
with
something
i
never
wanted
to
see
again
coffee
ray
yeah
i
guess
so
i
took
the
bottle
from
alice
and
wondered
whether
my
face
looked
as
glum
as
hers
they
should
salt
butter
pop
asserted
it
makes
it
lousy
for
shaving
it
was
the
butter
alice
said
yeah
i
said
the
dormouse
when
they
buttered
the
watch
it
may
be
true
that
feeble
humor
is
better
than
none
i
do
know
what
are
you
two
yakking
about
pop
demanded
a
book
we
both
read
i
told
him
either
of
you
writers
pop
asked
with
sudden
interest
some
of
the
boys
think
we
should
have
a
book
about
us
i
say
it
too
soon
but
they
say
we
might
all
die
off
or
something
whoa
jenny
easy
does
it
gently
please
that
last
remark
was
by
way
of
recognizing
that
the
plane
had
started
an
authoritative
turn
to
the
left
i
got
a
sick
and
cold
feeling
this
was
it
pop
sheathed
his
knife
and
gave
his
face
a
final
rub
alice
belted
on
her
satchel
i
reached
for
my
knapsack
but
i
was
staring
through
the
viewport
dead
ahead
the
haze
lightened
faintly
three
times
i
remembered
the
fire
that
had
flamed
from
the
cracking
plant
pop
i
said
almost
whined
to
be
truthful
why
the
bugger
ever
have
to
land
here
in
the
first
place
he
was
rushing
stuff
they
needed
bad
at
why
he
have
to
break
his
trip
that
easy
pop
said
he
was
being
a
bad
boy
at
least
that
my
theory
he
was
supposed
to
go
straight
to
but
there
was
somebody
he
wanted
to
check
up
on
first
he
stopped
here
to
see
his
girlfriend
yep
his
girlfriend
she
tried
to
warn
him
off
that
my
explanation
of
the
juice
that
flared
out
of
the
cracking
plant
and
interfered
with
his
landing
though
i
sure
she
did
intend
the
last
by
the
way
whatever
she
turned
on
to
give
him
the
warning
must
still
be
turned
on
but
grayl
came
on
down
in
spite
of
it
before
i
could
assimilate
that
the
seven
deformed
gas
tanks
materialized
in
the
haze
we
got
the
freeway
in
our
sights
and
steadied
and
slowed
and
kept
slowing
the
plane
did
graze
the
cracking
plant
this
time
though
i
have
sworn
it
was
going
to
hit
it
head
on
when
i
saw
we
going
to
hit
it
i
wanted
to
shut
my
eyes
but
i
could
the
stain
was
black
now
and
the
pilot
body
was
thicker
than
i
remembered
bloated
but
that
would
last
long
three
or
four
vultures
were
working
on
it
chapter
now
in
his
triumph
where
all
things
falter
stretched
out
on
the
spoils
that
his
own
hand
spread
as
a
god
on
his
own
strange
altar
death
lies
a
forsaken
garden
charles
pop
was
first
down
between
us
we
helped
alice
before
joining
them
i
took
a
last
look
at
the
control
panel
the
cracking
plant
button
was
up
again
and
there
was
a
blue
nimbus
on
another
button
for
los
alamos
i
supposed
i
was
tempted
to
push
it
and
get
away
solo
but
then
i
thought
there
nothing
for
me
at
the
other
end
and
the
loneliness
will
be
worse
than
what
i
got
to
face
i
climbed
out
i
did
look
at
the
body
although
we
were
practically
on
top
of
it
i
saw
a
little
patch
of
silver
off
to
one
side
and
remembered
the
gun
that
had
melted
the
vultures
had
waddled
off
but
only
a
few
yards
we
could
kill
them
alice
said
to
pop
why
he
responded
did
some
hindus
use
them
to
take
care
of
dead
bodies
not
a
bad
idea
either
parsees
alice
amplified
yep
parsees
that
what
i
meant
give
you
a
nice
clean
skeleton
in
a
matter
of
days
pop
was
leading
us
past
the
body
toward
the
cracking
plant
i
heard
the
flies
buzzing
loudly
i
felt
terrible
i
wanted
to
be
dead
myself
just
walking
along
after
pop
was
an
awful
effort
his
girl
was
running
a
hidden
observation
tower
here
pop
was
saying
now
weather
and
all
that
i
suppose
or
maybe
setting
up
a
robot
station
of
some
kind
i
could
tell
you
about
her
before
because
you
were
both
in
a
mood
to
try
to
rub
out
anybody
remotely
connected
with
the
pilot
in
fact
i
did
my
best
to
lead
you
astray
letting
you
think
i
been
the
one
to
scream
and
all
even
now
to
be
honest
about
it
i
do
know
if
i
doing
the
right
thing
telling
and
showing
you
all
this
but
a
man
got
to
take
some
risks
whatever
he
does
say
pop
i
said
dully
is
she
apt
to
take
a
shot
at
us
or
something
not
that
i
have
minded
on
my
own
account
or
are
you
and
her
that
good
friends
nope
ray
he
said
she
does
even
know
me
but
i
do
think
in
a
position
to
do
any
shooting
you
see
why
hey
she
has
even
shut
the
door
that
bad
he
seemed
to
be
referring
to
a
kind
of
manhole
cover
standing
on
its
edge
just
inside
the
first
story
of
the
cracking
plant
he
knelt
and
looked
down
the
hole
the
cover
was
designed
to
close
off
well
at
least
she
did
collapse
at
the
bottom
of
the
shaft
he
said
come
on
let
see
what
happened
and
he
climbed
into
the
shaft
we
followed
him
like
zombies
at
least
that
how
i
felt
the
shaft
was
about
twenty
feet
deep
there
were
and
it
got
stuffy
right
away
and
warmer
in
spite
of
the
shaft
being
open
at
the
top
at
the
bottom
there
was
a
short
horizontal
passage
we
had
to
duck
to
get
through
it
when
we
could
straighten
up
we
were
in
a
large
and
luxurious
dugout
to
give
it
a
name
and
it
was
stuffier
and
hotter
than
ever
there
was
a
lot
of
scientific
equipment
around
and
several
small
control
panels
reminding
me
of
the
one
in
the
back
of
the
plane
some
of
them
i
supposed
connected
with
instruments
weather
and
otherwise
hidden
up
in
the
skeletal
structure
of
the
cracking
plant
and
there
were
signs
of
occupancy
a
young
woman
occupancy
clothes
scattered
around
in
a
frivolous
way
and
some
small
objects
of
art
and
a
slightly
more
than
head
in
clay
that
i
guessed
the
occupant
must
have
been
sculpting
i
did
give
that
last
more
than
the
most
fleeting
look
strictly
unintentional
to
begin
with
because
although
it
finished
i
could
tell
whose
head
it
was
supposed
to
be
the
pilot
the
whole
place
was
finished
in
dull
silver
like
the
cabin
of
the
plane
and
likewise
it
instantly
struck
me
as
having
a
living
personality
partly
the
pilot
and
partly
someone
else
the
personality
of
a
marriage
which
was
a
bit
nice
because
the
whole
place
smelt
of
death
but
to
tell
the
truth
i
did
give
the
place
more
than
the
quickest
because
my
attention
was
rivetted
almost
at
once
on
a
long
wide
couch
with
the
covers
kicked
off
it
and
on
the
body
there
the
woman
was
about
six
feet
tall
and
built
like
a
goddess
her
hair
was
blonde
and
her
skin
tanned
she
was
lying
on
her
stomach
and
she
was
naked
she
did
come
anywhere
near
my
libido
though
she
looked
sick
to
death
her
face
twisted
towards
us
was
and
flushed
her
eyes
closed
were
sunken
and
she
was
breathing
shallowly
and
rapidly
through
her
open
mouth
gasping
now
and
then
i
got
the
crazy
impression
that
all
the
heat
in
the
place
was
coming
from
her
body
radiating
from
her
fever
and
the
whole
place
stunk
of
death
honestly
it
seemed
to
me
that
this
dugout
was
death
underground
temple
the
bed
death
altar
and
the
woman
death
sacrifice
had
i
unconsciously
come
to
worship
death
as
a
god
in
the
deathlands
i
do
really
know
there
it
gets
too
deep
for
me
no
she
did
come
within
a
million
miles
of
my
libido
but
there
was
another
part
of
me
that
she
was
eating
at
if
guilt
a
luxury
then
i
a
plutocrat
eating
at
until
i
was
an
empty
shell
until
i
had
no
props
left
until
i
wanted
to
die
then
and
there
until
i
figured
i
had
to
die
there
was
a
faint
sharp
hiss
right
at
my
elbow
i
looked
and
found
that
unbeknownst
to
myself
i
taken
the
steel
cube
out
of
my
pocket
and
holding
it
snuggled
between
my
first
and
second
fingers
i
punched
the
button
with
my
thumb
just
as
i
promised
myself
i
would
if
i
got
to
really
feeling
bad
it
goes
to
show
you
that
you
should
never
give
your
mind
any
kind
of
instructions
even
half
in
fun
unless
you
prepared
to
have
them
carried
out
whether
you
approve
later
or
not
pop
saw
what
i
done
and
looked
at
me
strangely
so
you
had
to
die
after
all
ray
he
said
softly
most
of
us
find
out
we
have
to
one
way
or
another
we
waited
nothing
happened
i
noticed
a
very
faint
milky
cloud
a
few
inches
across
hanging
in
the
air
by
the
cube
thinking
right
away
of
poison
gas
i
jerked
away
a
little
dispersing
the
cloud
what
that
i
demanded
of
no
one
in
particular
i
say
said
pop
that
that
something
that
squirted
out
of
a
tiny
hole
in
the
side
of
the
cube
opposite
the
button
a
hole
so
nearly
microscopic
you
would
see
it
unless
you
looked
for
it
hard
ray
i
do
think
you
going
to
get
your
baby
and
what
more
afraid
you
wasted
something
that
damn
valuable
but
do
let
it
worry
you
before
i
dropped
those
cubes
for
i
snagged
one
and
darn
if
he
did
pull
the
brother
of
my
cube
out
of
his
pocket
alice
he
said
i
noticed
a
half
pint
of
whiskey
in
your
satchel
when
we
got
the
salve
would
you
put
some
on
a
rag
and
hand
it
to
me
alice
looked
at
him
like
he
was
nuts
but
while
her
eyes
were
looking
her
pliers
and
her
gloved
hand
were
doing
what
he
told
her
pop
took
the
rag
and
swabbed
a
spot
on
the
sick
woman
nearest
buttock
and
jammed
the
cube
against
the
spot
and
pushed
the
button
it
a
jet
hypodermic
folks
he
said
he
took
the
cube
away
and
there
was
the
welt
to
substantiate
his
statement
hope
we
got
to
her
in
time
he
said
the
plague
is
tough
now
i
guess
there
nothing
for
us
to
do
but
wait
maybe
for
quite
a
while
i
felt
shaken
beyond
all
recognition
pop
you
old
caveman
detective
i
burst
out
when
did
you
get
that
idea
for
a
steel
hospital
do
think
i
was
feeling
anywhere
near
that
gay
it
was
reaction
close
to
hysterical
pop
was
taken
aback
but
then
he
grinned
i
had
a
couple
of
clues
that
you
and
alice
did
he
said
i
knew
there
was
a
very
sick
woman
involved
and
i
had
that
bout
with
los
alamos
fever
i
told
you
had
a
lot
of
trouble
with
it
i
believe
some
say
its
spores
come
from
outside
the
world
with
the
cosmic
dust
and
now
it
seems
to
have
been
carried
to
let
hope
they
found
the
answer
this
time
alice
maybe
we
better
start
getting
some
water
into
this
gal
after
a
while
we
sat
down
and
fitted
the
facts
together
more
orderly
pop
did
the
fitting
mostly
alamos
researchers
must
have
been
working
for
years
on
the
plague
as
it
ravaged
intermittently
maybe
with
mutations
and
et
tricks
to
make
the
job
harder
very
recently
found
a
promising
treatment
cure
we
hoped
and
prepared
it
for
rush
shipment
to
where
the
plague
was
raging
too
and
they
were
sieged
in
by
savannah
as
well
grayl
was
picked
to
fly
the
serum
or
drug
or
whatever
it
was
but
he
knew
or
guessed
that
this
lone
woman
observer
because
she
fallen
out
of
radio
communication
or
something
had
come
down
with
the
plague
too
and
he
decided
to
land
some
serum
for
her
probably
without
authorization
how
do
we
know
she
his
girlfriend
i
asked
or
wife
pop
said
tolerantly
why
there
was
that
bag
of
stuff
he
was
carrying
frilly
things
like
a
man
would
bring
for
a
woman
who
else
he
be
apt
to
make
a
special
stop
for
another
thing
pop
said
he
must
have
been
using
jets
to
hurry
his
trip
we
heard
them
you
know
that
seemed
about
as
close
a
reconstruction
of
events
as
we
could
get
strictly
hypothetical
of
course
deathlanders
trying
to
figure
out
what
goes
on
inside
a
country
like
and
are
sort
of
like
foxes
trying
to
understand
world
politics
or
wolves
the
gothic
migrations
of
course
we
all
human
beings
but
that
does
mean
as
much
as
it
sounds
then
pop
told
us
how
he
happened
to
be
on
the
scene
he
been
doing
a
tour
of
duty
as
he
called
it
when
he
spotted
this
observatory
and
decided
to
hang
around
anonymously
and
watch
over
her
for
a
few
days
and
maybe
help
protect
her
from
some
dangerous
characters
that
he
knew
were
in
the
neighborhood
pop
that
sounds
like
a
lousy
idea
to
me
i
objected
risky
i
mean
spying
on
another
person
watching
them
without
their
knowing
would
be
the
surest
way
to
stir
up
in
me
the
idea
of
murdering
them
safest
thing
for
me
to
do
in
that
situation
would
be
to
turn
around
and
run
probably
should
he
agreed
for
now
anyway
it
all
a
matter
of
knowing
your
own
strength
and
stage
of
growth
me
it
helps
to
give
myself
these
little
jobs
and
the
essence
of
is
that
the
other
person
should
know
i
helping
it
sounded
like
knighthood
and
pilgrimage
and
the
boy
scouts
all
over
again
for
murderers
well
why
not
pop
had
seen
this
woman
come
out
of
the
manhole
a
couple
of
times
and
look
around
and
then
go
back
down
and
he
got
the
impression
she
was
sick
and
troubled
he
even
guessed
she
might
be
coming
down
with
alamos
fever
he
seen
us
arrive
of
course
and
that
had
bothered
him
then
when
the
plane
landed
she
come
up
again
acting
out
of
her
head
but
when
she
seen
the
pilot
and
us
going
for
him
she
given
that
scream
and
collapsed
at
the
top
of
the
shaft
he
figured
the
only
thing
he
could
do
for
her
was
keep
us
occupied
besides
now
that
he
knew
for
sure
we
were
murderers
he
started
to
burn
with
the
desire
to
talk
to
us
and
maybe
help
us
quit
killing
if
we
seemed
to
want
to
it
was
only
much
later
in
the
middle
of
our
trip
that
he
began
to
suspect
that
the
steel
cubes
were
jet
hypodermics
while
pop
had
been
telling
us
all
this
we
had
been
watching
the
woman
so
closely
now
alice
called
our
attention
to
her
her
skin
was
covered
with
fine
beads
of
perspiration
like
diamonds
that
a
good
sign
pop
said
and
alice
started
to
wipe
her
off
while
she
was
doing
that
the
woman
came
to
in
a
groggy
sort
of
way
and
pop
fed
her
some
thin
soup
and
in
the
middle
of
his
doing
it
she
dropped
off
to
sleep
alice
said
any
other
time
i
would
be
wild
to
kill
another
woman
that
beautiful
but
she
has
been
so
close
to
death
that
i
would
feel
i
was
robbing
another
murderer
i
suppose
there
is
more
behind
the
change
in
my
feelings
than
that
though
yeah
a
little
i
suppose
pop
said
i
did
have
anything
to
say
about
my
own
feelings
certainly
not
out
loud
i
knew
that
they
had
changed
and
that
they
were
still
changing
it
was
complicated
after
a
while
it
occurred
to
me
and
alice
to
worry
whether
we
catch
this
woman
sickness
it
would
serve
us
right
of
course
but
plague
is
plague
but
pop
reassured
us
actually
i
snagged
three
cubes
he
said
that
should
take
care
of
you
two
i
figure
immune
time
wore
on
pop
dragged
out
the
harmonica
as
i
been
afraid
he
would
but
his
playing
was
too
bad
tenting
tonight
when
johnnie
comes
marching
home
and
such
we
had
a
meal
the
pilot
woman
woke
up
again
in
her
full
mind
this
time
or
something
like
it
we
were
clustered
around
the
bed
smiling
a
little
i
suppose
and
looking
inquiring
being
even
assistant
nurses
makes
you
all
concerned
about
the
patient
health
and
state
of
mind
pop
helped
her
sit
up
a
little
she
looked
around
she
saw
me
and
alice
recognition
came
into
her
eyes
she
drew
away
from
us
with
a
look
of
loathing
she
did
say
a
word
but
the
look
stayed
pop
drew
me
aside
and
whispered
i
think
it
would
be
a
nice
gesture
if
you
and
alice
took
a
blanket
and
went
up
and
sewed
him
into
it
i
noticed
a
big
needle
and
some
thread
in
her
satchel
he
looked
me
in
the
eye
and
added
you
ca
expect
this
woman
to
feel
any
other
way
toward
you
you
know
now
or
ever
he
was
right
of
course
i
gave
alice
the
high
sign
and
we
got
out
no
point
in
dwelling
on
the
next
scene
alice
and
me
sewed
up
in
a
blanket
a
big
guy
who
been
dead
a
day
and
worked
over
by
vultures
that
all
about
the
time
we
finished
pop
came
up
she
chased
me
out
he
explained
she
getting
dressed
when
i
told
her
about
the
plane
she
said
she
was
going
back
to
los
alamos
not
fit
to
travel
of
course
but
she
giving
herself
injections
none
of
our
business
incidentally
she
wants
to
take
the
body
back
with
her
i
told
her
how
we
dropped
the
serum
and
how
you
and
alice
had
helped
and
she
listened
the
pilot
woman
was
long
after
pop
she
must
have
had
trouble
getting
up
the
shaft
she
had
a
little
trouble
even
walking
straight
but
she
held
her
head
high
she
was
wearing
a
dull
silver
tunic
and
sandals
and
cloak
as
she
passed
me
and
alice
i
could
see
the
look
of
loathing
come
back
into
her
eyes
and
her
chin
went
a
little
higher
i
thought
why
should
she
want
us
dead
right
now
she
probably
wants
to
be
dead
herself
pop
nodded
to
us
and
we
hoisted
up
the
body
and
followed
her
it
was
almost
too
heavy
a
load
even
for
the
three
of
us
as
she
reached
the
plane
a
silver
ladder
telescoped
down
to
her
from
below
the
door
i
thought
pilot
must
have
had
it
keyed
to
her
some
way
so
it
would
let
down
for
her
but
nobody
else
a
very
lovely
the
ladder
went
up
after
her
and
we
managed
to
lift
the
body
above
our
heads
our
arms
straight
and
we
walked
it
through
the
door
of
the
plane
that
way
she
receiving
it
the
door
closed
and
we
stood
back
and
the
plane
took
off
into
the
orange
haze
us
watching
it
until
it
was
swallowed
pop
said
right
now
i
imagine
you
two
feel
pretty
good
in
a
sort
of
way
i
know
i
do
but
take
it
from
me
it
wo
last
a
day
or
two
and
we
going
to
start
feeling
another
way
the
way
if
we
do
get
busy
i
knew
he
was
right
you
do
shake
old
urge
number
one
anything
like
that
easy
so
said
pop
i
got
places
i
want
to
show
you
guys
i
want
you
to
meet
and
there
things
to
do
a
lot
of
them
let
get
moving
so
there
my
story
alice
is
still
with
me
urge
number
two
is
even
harder
to
shake
supposing
you
wanted
to
and
we
have
killed
anybody
lately
not
since
the
pilot
in
fact
but
it
does
do
to
boast
we
making
a
stab
my
language
at
doing
the
sort
of
work
pop
does
in
the
deathlands
it
tough
but
interesting
i
still
carry
a
knife
but
i
given
mother
to
pop
he
has
it
strapped
to
him
alongside
blade
and
alamos
still
seem
to
be
in
existence
so
i
guess
the
serum
worked
for
them
generally
as
it
did
for
the
pilot
woman
they
sent
us
any
medals
but
they
have
sent
a
hangman
squad
after
us
either
which
is
more
than
fair
you
admit
but
savannah
turned
back
from
is
still
going
strong
there
a
rumor
they
have
an
army
at
the
gates
of
ouachita
right
now
we
tell
pop
he
better
start
preaching
fast
it
one
of
our
standard
jokes
there
also
a
rumor
that
a
certain
fellowship
of
deathlanders
is
doing
surprisingly
well
a
rumor
that
there
a
new
america
growing
in
the
deathlands
an
america
that
never
need
kill
again
but
do
put
too
much
stock
in
it
not
much
