the

chapter
i
irene
i
suppose
i
am
there
was
a
murmur
of
polite
dissent
from
all
the
ladies
present
except
the
one
addressed
oh
i
take
it
as
a
compliment
nowadays
i
assure
you
but
when
i
was
a
girl
a
young
lady
would
have
no
more
thought
of
flying
than
of
she
paused
almost
on
a
note
of
pained
surprise
at
finding
the
familiar
comparison
of
a
lifetime
cut
off
well
of
standing
on
her
head
no
replied
the
young
lady
in
point
with
the
unfeeling
candour
that
marked
the
youthful
spirit
of
the
age
because
it
was
invented
but
you
went
bicycling
and
your
mothers
were
very
shocked
at
first
i
hardly
think
that
you
can
say
that
miss
lisle
remarked
another
of
the
matrons
because
i
can
remember
that
more
than
twenty
years
ago
one
used
to
see
quite
elderly
ladies
bicycling
after
the
others
had
lived
all
the
ridicule
down
retorted
miss
lisle
scornfully
oh
yes
i
quite
expect
that
in
a
few
more
years
you
will
see
quite
elderly
ladies
flying
the
little
party
of
matrons
seated
on
the
hastings
promenade
regarded
each
other
surreptitiously
and
one
or
two
smiled
slightly
while
one
or
two
shuddered
slightly
flying
is
very
different
dear
said
mrs
lisle
reprovingly
i
often
think
of
what
your
dear
grandfather
used
to
say
he
said
impressively
that
if
the
almighty
had
intended
that
we
should
fly
he
would
have
sent
us
into
the
world
with
wings
upon
our
backs
there
was
a
murmur
of
approval
from
all
all
except
miss
lisle
that
is
but
do
you
ever
think
of
what
geoffrey
replied
to
dear
grandpapa
when
he
heard
him
say
that
once
mother
said
the
unimpressed
daughter
he
said
do
you
think
sir
that
if
the
almighty
had
intended
us
to
use
railways
he
would
have
sent
us
into
the
world
with
wheels
upon
our
feet
i
do
not
see
any
connection
at
all
between
the
two
things
replied
her
mother
distantly
and
such
a
remark
seems
to
me
to
be
simply
irreverent
birds
are
born
with
wings
and
insects
and
so
on
but
nothing
as
far
as
i
am
aware
is
born
with
wheels
your
grandfather
used
to
travel
by
the
south
eastern
regularly
every
day
or
how
could
he
have
reached
his
office
and
he
never
saw
anything
wrong
in
using
trains
i
am
sure
in
fact
when
you
think
of
it
you
will
see
that
what
geoffrey
said
instead
of
being
any
argument
was
supremely
silly
perhaps
he
intended
it
to
be
replied
miss
lisle
with
suspicious
meekness
you
never
know
mother
such
a
remark
merited
no
serious
attention
why
should
any
one
least
of
all
a
really
clever
young
man
like
geoffrey
deliberately
to
be
silly
there
was
too
often
her
mother
had
observed
an
utter
lack
of
relevance
in
irene
remarks
i
think
that
it
is
a
great
mistake
to
have
white
flying
costumes
as
so
many
do
observed
another
lady
they
look
but
perhaps
they
wish
to
certainly
when
they
use
lace
as
well
it
really
seems
as
though
they
do
oh
there
was
a
passing
shadow
across
the
group
and
a
slight
rustle
in
the
air
scarcely
a
dozen
yards
above
the
promenade
a
young
lady
was
flying
strongly
down
the
wind
with
the
languid
motion
of
the
swan
stroke
she
wore
white
and
lace
trimming
mrs
lisle
gazed
fixedly
out
to
sea
even
irene
felt
that
the
vision
was
inopportune
there
are
always
some
who
overdo
a
thing
she
remarked
there
always
have
been
that
was
only
velma
st
saint
of
the
new
gaiety
she
flies
about
the
front
every
day
for
the
advertisement
of
the
thing
i
wonder
that
she
does
drop
handbills
as
she
goes
there
plenty
of
room
up
on
the
castle
hill
in
fact
you
are
supposed
to
fly
west
of
the
breakwater
but
there
will
always
be
some
a
vague
resentment
closed
the
period
are
you
staying
at
the
palatial
this
time
asked
the
lady
who
had
mentioned
lace
feeling
it
tactful
to
change
the
subject
i
think
that
you
used
to
oh
have
you
seen
was
the
reply
the
palatial
has
been
closed
for
the
last
six
months
yes
it
a
great
pity
remarked
another
it
looks
so
depressing
too
right
on
the
front
but
they
simply
could
not
go
on
i
suppose
that
the
rates
here
are
something
frightful
now
oh
enormous
my
dear
but
it
was
not
that
alone
the
palatial
has
always
aimed
at
being
a
hotel
and
so
few
of
the
upper
middle
class
can
afford
hotels
now
then
the
new
tax
on
every
servant
above
one
calculated
as
fifty
per
cent
of
their
wages
i
think
but
there
are
so
many
new
taxes
to
remember
proved
the
last
straw
yes
it
is
fifty
per
cent
i
remember
because
i
had
to
give
up
my
to
pay
the
cook
tax
but
i
thought
that
hotels
were
to
be
exempt
not
in
the
end
it
was
argued
that
hotels
existed
for
the
convenience
of
the
monied
classes
and
that
they
ought
to
pay
for
it
so
a
large
number
of
hotels
are
closed
altogether
others
work
with
a
reduced
staff
and
a
great
many
servants
have
been
thrown
out
of
employment
miss
lisle
laughed
unpleasantly
a
good
thing
too
she
remarked
i
hate
hotel
servants
so
does
everybody
it
is
the
only
good
thing
i
have
heard
of
the
labour
government
doing
i
am
sure
i
do
hate
them
said
mrs
lisle
looking
round
with
pathetic
resignation
although
they
certainly
had
become
rather
grasping
and
of
late
but
it
was
quite
an
unforeseen
development
of
the
scheme
that
so
many
should
lose
their
places
indeed
the
special
object
of
the
tax
was
to
create
a
fund
i
think
they
call
it
out
of
which
to
meet
the
growing
pension
claim
now
that
so
few
of
the
servant
class
think
it
worth
while
to
save
miss
lisle
laughed
again
this
time
with
a
note
of
genuine
amusement
a
most
unpleasant
girl
i
fear
murmured
the
lady
who
had
raised
the
white
costume
question
to
her
neighbour
in
a
whisper
so
odd
it
made
a
great
difference
at
the
registry
offices
there
are
a
dozen
maids
to
be
had
any
day
where
there
were
really
none
before
only
one
can
not
afford
to
keep
them
now
there
was
a
word
a
sigh
and
an
ah
to
mark
this
point
of
agreement
among
the
four
ladies
i
am
afraid
that
the
government
confiscation
of
all
dividends
above
five
per
cent
bears
very
heavily
on
some
remarked
one
after
a
pause
i
know
a
poor
soul
of
over
nearly
blind
too
whose
husband
had
invested
all
his
savings
in
the
company
he
had
worked
for
because
he
knew
that
it
was
safe
and
having
a
good
reserve
intended
to
pay
ten
per
cent
for
a
long
time
when
he
died
it
brought
her
in
fifty
pounds
a
year
now
there
were
little
signs
of
sympathy
and
commiseration
from
the
group
the
sex
was
beginning
to
take
an
unwonted
interest
in
terms
financial
per
centage
surrender
value
trustee
stock
unearned
increment
and
so
on
they
had
reason
to
do
so
for
revolutionary
finance
was
very
much
in
the
air
or
rather
had
come
tangibly
down
to
earth
at
length
not
the
placid
city
echoes
that
were
wont
to
ripple
gently
across
the
a
few
years
earlier
without
leaving
any
one
much
better
or
much
worse
off
but
the
galvanic
adjustment
that
by
a
stroke
made
the
rich
the
just
the
struggling
poor
and
left
the
poor
where
they
were
before
the
frenzied
effort
that
in
a
session
strove
to
tear
up
the
trees
of
the
forest
and
leave
the
plants
beneath
untouched
to
pull
to
pieces
the
intertwined
fabric
of
a
thousand
years
growth
and
to
create
from
it
a
bundle
of
straight
and
equal
twigs
in
a
word
to
administer
justice
on
the
principle
of
knocking
out
one
eye
in
all
the
sound
because
a
number
of
people
were
unfortunately
born
or
fallen
blind
five
and
twenty
mused
mrs
lisle
i
suppose
it
is
just
possible
it
is
really
less
than
that
explained
the
other
you
may
have
noticed
that
as
it
is
now
no
good
making
more
than
five
per
most
companies
pay
even
less
there
is
no
incentive
to
do
well
one
hears
of
even
worse
cases
on
every
hand
said
another
of
the
ladies
i
am
trying
to
interest
people
in
a
poor
deformed
creature
whose
father
left
her
an
annuity
derived
from
ground
rents
in
the
city
as
it
has
been
worked
out
i
think
that
she
owes

adjustment
department
lawyers
something
a
year
now
but
private
charity
seems
almost
to
have
ceased
altogether
have
you
heard
that
is
closed
it
was
true
st
james
hospital
whose
unvarnished
record
was
three
hundred
of
the
very
poor
treated
freely
each
day
was
a
thing
of
the
past
and
across
its
portal
where
ten
years
before
a
couple
of
stalwart
gentlemen
wearing
red
ties
had
rested
for
a
moment
while
they
lit
their
pipes
a
banner
with
the
strange
device
curse
your
charity
now
ran
the
legend
closed
for
want
of

i
wonder
sometimes
mused
the
last
speaker
why
some
one
does
do
something
but
objected
another
what
is
there
to
do
what
is
there
they
all
agreed
that
there
was
nothing
absolutely
nothing
every
one
else
was
tacitly
making
the
same
admission
that
was
the
fatal
symptom
miss
lisle
jumped
up
and
began
to
move
away
unceremoniously
where
are
you
going
dear
asked
her
mother
in
mild
reproof
oh
anywhere
replied
irene
restlessly
but
what
for
persisted
mrs
lisle
oh
anything
that
is
miss
lisle
smiled
the
tactful
lady
of
the
party
anxious
to
smooth
over
the
awkwardness
of
the
moment
no
it
is
at
least
something
flung
back
the
girl
brusquely
and
with
swinging
strides
she
set
off
at
a
furious
pace
towards
the
open
country

chapter
ii
the
period
and
the
coming
of
wings
an
intelligent
south
sea
islander
who
had
been
imported
into
this
country
to
stimulate
missionary
enterprise
on
his
return
had
said
that
the
most
marked
characteristic
of
the
english
of
the
period
was
what
they
called
snap
the
nearest
equivalent
in
his
own
language
signifying
literally
quick
hot
words
he
had
some
difficulty
in
conveying
the
impression
he
desired
and
his
circle
had
to
rest
content
that
snap
permeated
the
journalism
commerce
politics
drama
and
social
life
of
the
english
had
assailed
their
literature
and
was
beginning
to
influence
religion
art
and
science
it
may
be
admitted
that
the
foreign
gentleman
visit
had
coincided
with
a
period
of
national
stress
for
the
week
in
question
had
embraced
the
more
entertaining
half
of
a
general
election
seen
the
advent
of
two
new
farthing
daily
papers
and
been
marked
by
the
rev
sebastian
tauthaul
striking
series
of
addresses
from
the
pulpit
of
the
city
sanctum
entitled
if
christ
put
up
for
battersea
it
had
also
included
the
launching
of
a
new
cocoa
a
new
soap
and
a
new
concentrated
food
the
new
food
was
called
a
name
which
i
venture
to
think
spells
success
of
itself
complacently
remarked
its
inventor
a
very
good
name
indeed
admitted
his
advertising
manager
it
has
the
great
desideratum
that
it
might
be
anything
and
on
the
other
hand
it
might
equally
well
be
nothing
just
so
said
the
inventor
with
weighty
approval
just
so
a
was
required
that
would
ineradicably
fix
in
the
public
mind
and
feel
chippy
then
champ
was
found
in
an
inspired
moment
it
was
of
course
fully
cooked
and
already
quite
digested
it
was
described
as
the
delight
of
the
unweaned
infant
the
mainstay
of
the
toothless
nonagenarian
and
so
simple
and
wholesome
that
it
could
be
safely
taken
and
at
once
assimilated
by
the
invalid
who
had
undergone
the
operation
of
having
his
principal
organ
of
digestion
removed
so
little
indeed
remained
for
nature
and
the
human
parts
to
do
in
the
matter
of
as
to
raise
the
doubt
whether
it
might
not
be
simpler
and
scarcely
less
nutritive
to
open
the
tin
and
pour
the
contents
down
the
drain
forthwith
as
was
designed
for
those
who
were
disinclined
to
exercise
the
functions
of
digestion
so
isabella
soap
made
an
appeal
to
those
who
disliked
work
and
had
something
of
an
antipathy
to
soap
at
all
one
did
not
wash
with
isabella
it
was
assured
one
sat
down
and
watched
it
it
had
its
too
you
write
it
but
you
call
it
what
is
the
difference
there
is
difference
there
is
also
difference
between
isabella
soap
and
all
other
soaps
all
the
difference
that
our
point
put
it
in
your
washtub
and
watch
it
cocoa

approached
in
a
more
sober
spirit

exuberance
of

relied
upon
sincerity
and
statistics
kingcup
cocoa
was
the
last
word
of
the
expert
it
won
its
way
into
the
great
heart
of
the
people
by
driving
home
the
significant
fact
that
it
contained
per
cent
more
phosphorus
and
per
cent
less
of
something
fatty
than
any
other
cocoa
in
existence
when
the
newspaper
reader
of
the
period
had
been
confronted
by
this
assertion
in
various
guises
seventeen
thousand
times
he
had
reached
a
state
of
mind
in
which
per
cent
more
phosphorus
and
per
cent
less
fat
represented
the
difference
between
vigorous
manhood
and
drivelling
imbecility
the
rev
sebastian
was
all
snap
his
topical
midday
addresses
described
by
himself
as
seven
minutes
have
already
been

to
young
men
who
were
pressed
for

bidden
to

their
bath
buns
or
buttered
scones
and
eat
openly
and
unashamed
workmen
with
bread
and

and

were
welcomed
with
effusion

over
the

of

of
their
sprightliness

their

their
almost
wicked
experience
of

where
quite
provisions

nominally
damaged
could

on
saturday
nights
it
is
unnecessary
to
say
much
of
their
irresponsible
their
bristling
combativeness
their
amazing
powers
of
prophetic
penetration
and
it
must
be
confessed
their
ineradicable
air
of
somewhat
infant
phenomenonship
their
crumbling
yellow
files
still
bear
witness
as
a
halfpenny

half

half

described
its
programme
as
vervy
and
nervy
brainy

neither

confidence
of

that

but
the
most
cursory
review
of
national
snappishness
would
be
incomplete
if
it
omitted
the
field
of
politics
especially
when
the
period
in

contained
so
concentrated
an
accumulation
of

as

had
long
ceased

its
the
outcome
as
a
whole
the
decision
of
each
division
with
few
exceptions
lay
in
the
hands
of
a
class
which
while
educated
to
the
extent
of
a
little
reading
and
a
little

was
practically
illiterate

in

in

best
argument
to
a
decayed
egg

never
so
far
been
evolved
out
of
this
method
could
be
traced
to
a
variety
of
saving

at
such
a

the
strict
veracity
of
the

raised
was
not
to
be
too
closely
examined
indeed
there
was
not
the

for
contradiction

therein
lay
the
essence
of
some
of
the
most
successful
snaps
misrepresentation
if
on
a
sufficiently
large
scale
was
permissible
but
it
was
advisable
to
make
it
wholesale
lurid
and
applied
not
to
an
individual
but
to
a
party
emphasising
of
course
the
fact
that
your
opponent
was
irretrievably
pledged
to
that
party
through
thick
and
thin
in
other
words
it
was
quite
legitimate
for
a
to
declare
that
the
policy
of
the
party
to
which
his
opponent
b
belonged
was
a
policy
of
murder
rapine
piracy
highway
robbery
extermination
and
indiscriminate
bloodshed
that
they
had
swum
to

on
a
sea
of

racked
from

broken
hearts
of
an
outraged
peasantry
risen
to
power
on
the
apex
of
a
smoking
hecatomb
of
women
and

and
kept
their
position
by
methods
of
ruthless
barbarism
that
assassination
polygamy

simony

and
perhaps
even
an
additional

would
very
likely
be
found
included
in
their
official
programme
that
they
were
definitely
pledged

would
work

content
with
three

for
a
fourteen

and
live
exclusively
on

and
this
and
much
more
was
held
to
be
fair
political
warfare

not

stood
a

the

not
necessarily
with
a
just

with

the

could
not
escape
the

the

were
wonderfully
snappy
for

afterwards
it
might
be
noticed
that
when
the
props
were
pulled
away
they
were
generally
either
annoyingly
dull
or
objectionably
pert
or
perhaps
offensively
according
to
whether

or
a

they
could
not

what
they
had
not

drilled
to

they

not

you
sitting
down
doing
nothing

said
every

there
no

so
the

was
harried
into
working

eating
or
sleeping
as
though
a
mind
contentedly
occupied
with
itself
was
an
unworthy
or
a
morbid
thing
yet
it
was
a
too
close
adherence
to
the
national
character
that
proved
to
be
the
undoing
of
wynchley
slocombe
who
is
now
generally
admitted
to
have
been
the
father
of
the
form
of
aerial
propulsion
so
widely
enjoyed
like
everybody
else
he
had

at

apart
within

of
seven

and
without

more
than
fifty
yards
from
a
straight

connecting

points
to
travel
in
a
circle
of
not
less
than
three
miles
in
circumference
within
a

of
fifteen
minutes
wynchley
took
an
ordinary
intelligent
interest
in
the
subject
but
he
had
no
thought
of
competing
it
was
not
until
the
last
day
of
the
period
allowed
for
submitting
plans
that
wynchley
great
idea
occurred
to
him
there
was
then
no
time
for
elaborating
the
germ
or
for
preparing
the
requisite
specifications
even
if
he
had
any
ability
to
do
so
which
he
had
not
being
in
fact
quite
ignorant
of
the
subject
but
he
remembered
hearing
in
his
youth
that
when
a
former
government
of
its
day
had
offered
a
premium
for
a
convenient
method
of
dividing
postage
stamps
until
that
time
sold
in
unperforated
sheets
and
cut
up
as
required
by
the
users
the
successful
competitor
had
simply
tendered
the
advice
punch
rows
of
little
holes
between
them
in
the
same
spirit
wynchley
slocombe
took
half
a
sheet
of
silurian
notepaper
now
become
famous
and
preserved
in
the
south
kensington
museum
and
wrote
on
it

unfortunately
the
departmental
offices
were
the
only
places
in
england
where
snap
was
not
recognised
wynchley
was
regarded
as
a
suicidal
lunatic
a
familiar
enough
figure
in
circles
and
his
suggestion
was
duly
without
consideration
the
subsequent
career
of
the
unhappy
man
may
be
briefly
stated
disappointed
in
his
hopes
of
an
early
recognition
and
not
having
sufficient
money
at
his
disposal
to
demonstrate
the
practicability
of
his
idea
he
took
to
writing
letters
to
the
president
of
the
board
and
subsequently
to
waylaying
high
officials
and
demanding
interviews
with
them
dismissed
from
his
situation
for
systematic
neglect
of
duty
he
became
a
poor
litigant
with
a
grievance
at
the
law
courts
and
periodically
applied
for
summonses
against
the
prime
minister
the
lord
mayor
of
london
and
the
archbishop
of
canterbury
still
later
his
name
became
a
as
that
of
a
confirmed
at
the
government
offices
a
few
years
afterwards
a
brief
paragraph
in
one
or
two
papers
announced
that
wynchley
slocombe
who
some
time
ago
gained
an
unenviable
notoriety
on
account
of
his
hallucinations
had
committed
suicide
in
a
deptford
model
in
the
meanwhile
two
plans
for
had
been
selected
as
displaying
the
most
merit
and
their
inventors
were
encouraged
to
press
on
with
the
construction
under
a
monetary
grant
both
were
finished
during
the
same
week
and
for
the
sake
of
comparison
they
were
submitted
to
trial
on
the
same
day
upon
shorncliffe
plain
which
resembled
a
spider
with
outspread
legs
made
the
first
ascent
according
to
instructions
it
was
to
demonstrate
its
ability
to
go
in
a
straight
line
by
descending
in
a
field
near
the
military
canal
beyond
seabrook
but
from
the
moment
of
its
release
it
continued
to
describe
short
circles
with
a
velocity
hitherto
unattained
in
any
until
its
frantic
constructor
was
too
dizzy
to
struggle
with
its
mechanism
any
longer
the
was
then
unmoored
and
took
up
its
position
stationary
at
a
height
of
feet
with
absolute
precision
it
was
built
on
the
lines
of
a
gigantic
centipede
with
two
rows
of
clubby
oars
beneath
and
ranked
as
the
popular
favourite
being
instructed
for
the
sake
of
variety
to
begin
with
the
three

circle

to

of

sinuous
motion

rippled
down
its
long
vertebrate
body
producing
an
effect
accidental
but
so
very
that
many
of
the
vast
concourse
assembled
on
the
ground
turned
pale
and
could
not
follow
it
unmoved
there
have
been
many
plausible
theories
put
forward
by
experts
to
account
for
the
subsequent
disaster
but
for
obvious
reasons
the
real
explanation
can
never
progress
beyond
the
realms
of
conjecture
for
the
instead
of
bending
to
the
east
encircling
folkestone
and
its
suburbs
and
descending
again
in
the
middle
of
shorncliffe
camp
continued
its
unswerving
line
towards
the
coast
of
france
and
never
held
communication
with
civilised
man
again
so
exact
was
its
course
however
that
it
was
easy
to
trace
its
passage
across
europe
it
reached
boulogne
about
four
in
the
afternoon
and
was
cheered
vociferously
under
the
pathetic
impression
that
everything
was
going
well
amiens
saw
it
a
little
to
the
east
in
the
fading
light
of
evening
and
a
few
early
citizens
of
dijon
marked
it
soon
after
dawn
its
passage
over
the
alps
was
accurately
timed
and
noted
at
several
points
and
the
italian
frontier
had
a
glimpse
of
it
very
high
up
it
was
recorded
at
nightfall
a
gentleman
of
ajaccio
travelling
in
the
interior
of
the
island
thought
that
he
had
seen
it
some
time
during
the
next
day
and
several
tripoli
greeks
swore
that
it
had
passed
a
few
yards
above
their
heads
a
week
later
but
the
testimony
of
the
corsican
was
deemed
the
more
reliable
of
the
two
a
relief
expedition
was
subsequently
sent
out
and
traversed
a
great
part
of
africa
but
although
the
natives
in
the
district
around
the
albert

repeatedly
prostrated
themselves
and

their
thighs

and
recognition
when
shown
a
small
working
model
of
the
no
further
trace

ever
obtained
of
it
the
accident
had
a
curious
sequel
in
the
house
of

which
significantly
illustrates
how
unexpected
may
be
the
ultimate
developments
of
a
chain
of
circumstance
it
so

complement

this
gentleman
who
had
made
entomology
a
lifelong
study
was
invaluable
to
his
office
and
the
lamentable
consequence
of
his
absence
was
that
when
the
president
of
the
board
rose
the
following
night
to
answer
a
question
respecting
the
importation
of
to
arrest
an
aphis
plague
then
devastating
the
orchards
of

country
he
ingenuously
displayed
so
striking
an
unfamiliarity
with
the
subject
that
his
resignation
was
demanded

a

forced

the

for

doubtless
have
crumbled

a
trivial
incident
a

finding
himself
to
be
without

one
morning
and
hesitating
to
mutilate
the
copy
of

us
say

he
was
reading
at
the
moment
tore
a
sheet
haphazard
from

close
at

was
there
anything
in

why
could
not

there

been

how
did
the

usually
by
precipitating
themselves
out

an
upper
window
in
the
first
flush
of
their
they
were
killed
and
wings
fell
into
disfavour
but
the
same
result
would
attend
the
unsophisticated
novice
who
made
his
first
essay
in
swimming
by
diving
off
a
cliff
into
ten
fathoms
deep
of
water
here
even
in
a
denser
medium
was
the
admitted
necessity
for

practice
before
security
was
assured
phipps
looked
a
step
further
by
nature
man
is
for
flying
whereas
he
possesses
in
himself
all
the
requisites
for
successful
propulsion
through
the
water
yet
he
needs
practice
in
water
more
practice
therefore
in

for
thousands
of
years
mankind
has
been
swimming
and
thereby
lightening
the
task
for
his
descendants
to
such
an
extent
that
in
certain

the
children
swim
almost
naturally
even
before
they
walk

with
the
solitary
exception
of
a
certain
fabled

who
made
the
attempt
so
successfully
and
attained
such
a
height

he

the
million
to

chance
so
wings
came
to
stay
every
one
admitted
although
most
people
complained
that
after
all
flying
was
not
so
wonderful
when
one
could
do
it
as
they
thought
it
would
have
been
for
at
the
first
glance
the
popular
fancy
had
inclined
towards
pinning
on
a
pair
of
gauzy
appendages
and
soaring
at
once
into
empyrean
heights
with
the
spontaneity
of
a
lark
or
of
lightly
fluttering
from
point
to
point
with
the
ease
and
grace
of
a
butterfly
they
found
that
a
pair
of
wings
cost
rather
more
than
a
bicycle
and
that
the

who
could
struggle
from
the
stage
into
a
net
placed
twenty
yards
away
after

been

as
an
undiluted
blessing
but

did
not
come
up
to
the

expectation
there
were

found
in
it
a

there
were

discovering

its
possibilities
and
to
raise
it
above
the
level
of
a
mere
fashionable
novelty
there
have
always
been
some
a
few
not
infrequently
englishmen
who
have
unostentatiously
become
in
every
development
of
science
with
a
fixity
of
purpose
their
names
rarely
appear
in
the
pages
of
history
but
they
largely
write
it
hastings
permitted
mixed
flying
it
was
a
question
that
had
embittered
many
a
town
council
to
one
section
it
seemed
intolerable
that
a
father
a
husband
or
a
brother
should
be
torn
for
twenty
minutes
from
the
side
of
his
female
relatives
to
the
opposing
section
it
seemed
horrible
that
coatless
men
should
be
allowed
to
spread
their
wings
within
a
hundred
and
fifty
yards
of
shoeless
women
i
have
no
particular
convictions
one
prominent
citizen
remarked
but
in
view
of
the
existing
railway
facilities
it
is
worth
while
considering
whether
we
shall
have
any
visitors
at
all
this
season
if
we
stand
in
the
way
of
families
flying
down
together
the
humour
of
the
age
was
flowing
mordaciously
even
as
the
wit
of
france
had
done
little
more
than
a
century
before
the
readiest
jests
carried
a
tang
whether
turning
upon
personal
poverty
municipal
extravagance
or
national
incapacity
opinion
being
evenly
divided
the
local
rate
of
seventeen
shillings
in
the
pound
influenced
the
casting
vote
in
favour
of
mixed
flying
there
were
necessary
preparations
including
a
captive
balloon
in
which
an
ancient
mariner
decked
out
with
a
pair
of
wings
like
a
superannuated
cupid
was
posted
to
render
assistance
to
the
faltering
the
rates
at
once
rose
to
seventeen
shillings
and
sixpence
but
the
principle
of
the
enterprise
was
admitted
to
be
sound
so
on
this
pleasant
summer
afternoon
an
ideal
day
for
a
fly
said
every
one
the
heights
above
the
old
town
were
echoing
to
the
ceaseless
gaiety
of
the
watching
crowd
for
alatics
had
not
yet
ceased
to
be
a
novelty
while
the
air
above
was
cleft
by
a
hundred
pairs
of
beating
wings
a
remarkable
sight
said
an
old
man
who
had
opened
conversation
with
the
sociable
craving
of
the
aged
ten
years
ago
we
little
expected
this
why
no
replied
his
chance
acquaintance
on
the
seat
if
i
remember
rightly
the
tendency
was
all
towards
a
combination
either
of
a
balloon
and
a
or
of
a
submarine
and
a
you
do
fly
yourself
the
young
man
and
he
was
a
stalwart
enough
youth
looked
at
himself
critically
as
if
mentally
picturing
the
effect
of
a
pair
of
wings
upon
his
person
well
no
he
replied
one
does
get
the
time
for
practice
then
consider
the
price
of
the
things
and
the
annual
licence
oh
they
wo
let
you
forget
i
assure
you
well
is
it
worth
it
the
old
man
shook
his
head
in
harmonious
agreement
decidedly
for
him
it
was
not
worth
it
perhaps
you
are
in
somerset
house
he
remarked
tentatively
it
is
not
the
young
who
are
curious
they
have
the
fascinating
study
of
themselves
not
exactly
replied
the
other
veiling
by
this
diplomatic
ambiguity
an
eminent
firm
of
west
end
drapers
but
i
happen
to
have
rather
exceptional
chances
of
knowing
what
is
going
on
behind
the
scenes
in
london
i
can
assure
you
sir
that
in
spite
of
the
last
sixpence
on
the
and
the
tax
the
chancellor
of
the
exchequer
has
sent
out
stringent
orders
to
whip
up
every
penny
in
the
hope
of
lessening
a
serious
deficit
there
may
possibly
be
a
deficit
admitted
the
old
man
with
bland
assurance
but
what
do
a
few
millions
either
one
way
or
the
other
matter
to
a
country
with
our
inexhaustible
resources
we
are
certainly
passing
through
a
period
of
financial
depression
but
the
unfailing
lesson
of
the
past
has
been
that
a
cycle
of
bad
years
is
inevitably
followed
by
a
cycle
of
good
years
and
in
the
competition
with
foreign
countries
our
advantage
of
free
trade
ensures
our
for
it
is
a
mistake
now
to
ascribe
optimism
to
youth
those
youths
have
by
this
time
grown
up
into
old
men
age
is
the
optimist
because
it
has
seen
so
many
things
come
right
so
many
difficulties
muddled
through
also
because
they
who
would
have
been
pessimistic
old
men
have
worried
themselves
into
early
graves
your
unquenchable
optimist
needs
no
pill
to
aid
digestion
then
he
concluded
why
trouble
yourself
unnecessarily
on
a
beautiful
day
like
this
oh
it
does
trouble
me
laughed
the
other
man
at
least
the
deficit
does
nor
the
i
regret
to
say
but
i
rather
kick
at
ten
per
cent
on
my
season
ticket
and
a
few
other
trifles
when
i
consider
that
there
used
to
be
better
national
value
without
them
and
i
rather
think
that
most
others
have
had
about
enough
of
it
patience
patience
you
are
a
young
man
yet
look
round
i
do
think
i
ever
saw
the
grass
greener
for
the
time
of
the
year
and
in
my
front
garden
i
noticed
only
that
the
syringa
is
out
a
full
week
earlier
than
i
can
remember
eh
what
is
it
which
way
where
the
clerk
was
on
his
feet
suddenly
and
standing
on
the
seat
every
one
was
standing
up
and
all
in
a
common
impulse
were
pointing
to
the
sky
some
women
screamed
as
they
stood
and
watched
but
after
a
gasp
of
horrified
surprise
like
a
cry
of
warning
cut
short
because
too
late
the
mingling
noises
of
the
crowd
seemed
to
shrink
away
in
a
breath
every
one
had
read
of
the
sickening
tragedies
of
broken
or
of
sudden
loss
of
ærolanguisis
it
was
called
and
one
was
taking
place
before
their
eyes
high
up
very
high
at
first
and
a
little
to
the
east
a
female
figure
was
cleaving
headlong
through
the
air
and
beyond
all
human
power
to
save
so
one
would
have
said
so
every
one
indeed
assumed
and
when
a
second
later
another
figure
crossed
their
range
it
only
heralded
a
double
tragedy
it
drew
a
gasp
a
gasp
that
lingered
spun
out
long
and
turned
to
one
loud
tumultuous
shout
the
next
minute
men
were
shouting
incoherently
dancing
wildly
shaking
hands
with
all
and
any
and
expressing
frantic
relief
in
a
hundred
frantic
ways
thus
makes
his
timely
entry
into
this
chronicle
gatacre
stobalt
and
reviewing
the
progress
of
flying
as
it
then
immaturely
stood
it
is
not
too
much
to
say
that
no
other
man
could
have
turned
that
tragedy
with
an
instinctive
judgment
of
time
distance
angle
and
his
own
powers
stobalt
from
a
hundred
feet
above
had
leapt
as
a
diver
often
leaps
as
he
leaves
the
plank
and
with
rigid
outstretched
wings
was
dropping
earthward
on
all
but
a
plummet
line
it
was
the
famous
stroke
at
its
narrowest
angle
the
delight
of
strong
and
daring
fliers
the
terror
of
those
who
watched
beneath
it
may
be
realised
by
ascending
to
the
highest
point
of
st
paul
and
contemplating
a
dive
into
the
flooded
churchyard
the
moment
was
a
classic
one
in
the
history
of
the
wing
the
air
had
claimed
its
victims
as
the
waters
have
and
there
was
a
legitimate
pride
since
the
enterprise
was
no
longer
foolhardy
that
they
had
never
been
withheld
but
never
before
had
a
rescue
been
effected
beyond
the
limits
of
the
nets
it
was
not
then
deemed
practicable
and
the
axiom
of
the
sport
a
broken
wing
is
a
broken
neck
so
far
held
good
yet
here
was
a
man
no
novice
in
the
art
deliberately
pointing
sheer
to
earth
on
a
line
that
must
bring
him
if
unswervingly
maintained
into
contact
with
the
falling
girl
beneath
up
to
that
point
the
attempt
would
have
been
easy
if
daring
beyond
it
nothing
but
the
readiest
and
the
most
consummate
skill
could
avert
an
irretrievable
disaster
to
himself
you
have
not
even
had
the
curiosity
to
ask
if
i
am
hurt
yet
her
voice
certainly
was
x
murmured
stobalt
abstractedly
i
assure
you
he
explained
leaving
the
higher
mathematics
at
her
reproach
that
i
had
quite
satisfied
myself
that
you
were
not
it
all
turns
on
the
extra
tension
thrown
on
the
crank
by
the
additional
three
feathers
i
am
convinced
that
english
makers
have
gone
as
far
as
they
safely
can
in
that
direction
he
glanced
at
her
wings
as
he
mused
they
were
of
the
familiar
detached
feather
or
venetian
blind
as
it
was
commonly
called
pattern
and
wonderfully
graceful
in
their
long
sweep
and
elegant
poise
made
of
the
purest
white
celluloid
just
tinted
with
a
delicate
and
deepening
pink
at
the
base
they
harmonised
with
her
costume
as
faultlessly
as
the
lily
with
the
leaves
it
springs
from
stobalt
himself
used
the
more
difficult
but
much
more
powerful
bat
shape
built
up
of
skin
he
had
already
folded
them
in
rest
but
in
those
early
days
the
prudish
conventions
of
the
air
debarred
the
girl
from
seeking
a
like
repose
i
should
certainly
discard
the
three
outside
feathers
he
summed
up
i
shall
certainly
discard
the
whole
thing
she
replied
i
do
not
know
which
felt
the
worse
being
killed
or
being
saved
he
made
a
gesture
that
would
seem
to
say
that
the
personal
details
of
the
adventure
were
better
dismissed
he
was
plainly
a
man
of
few
words
but
the
mechanical
defect
still
held
his
interest
one
understands
that
a
brave
man
always
dislikes
being
thanked
she
continued
a
little
nervously
and
indeed
what
can
i
say
to
thank
you
you
have
saved
my
life
and
i
know
that
it
must
have
been
at
a
tremendous
risk
to
yourself
i
think
he
said
that
the
sooner
you
forget
the
incident
that
and
the
removal
of
those
three
feathers
his
gestures
were
deliberate
and
the
reverse
of
vivacious
but
when
he
glanced
up
and
moved
a
hand
it
at
once
conveyed
to
the
girl
that
in
his
opinion
nothing
else
need
stand
in
the
way
of
her
recovered
powers
and
confidence
and
there
is
she
said
timidly
nothing
precisely
what
there
might
be
had
not
occurred
to
her
satisfactorily
nothing
he
said
without
the
air
of
being
heroic
in
his
generosity
unless
he
added
you
care
to
promise
that
you
will
not
let
he
stopped
with
easy
and
turned
enquiringly
to
a
man
in
some
official
dress
who
had
suddenly
appeared
in
the
glade
have
you
a
licence
demanded
the
official
ignoring
stobalt
and
addressing
himself
in
a
style
that
at
one
time
would
have
been
deemed
objectionably
abrupt
to
the
lady
he
was
in
point
of
fact
a
policeman
and
from
a
thong
on
his
wrist
swung
a
truncheon
while
the
butt
of
a
revolver
showed
at
his
belt
he
wore
no
number
or
identifying
mark
for
it
had
long
since
been
agreed
that
it
must
be
objectionable
to
their
finer
feelings
to
treat
policemen
as
though
they
were
one
can
not
say
convicts
for
a
sympathetic
home
secretary
had
already
discontinued
the
numbering
of
convicts
on
the
ground
that
it
created
a
state
of
things
undistinguishable
from
slavery
though
not
really
slavery
but
as
though
they
were
railway
bridges
or
district
council
treat
a
man
as
a
dog
and
he
becomes
a
dog
had
been
the
invincible
argument
of
the
band
of
humanitarians
who
had
introduced
what
was
known
as
the
system
of
prison
discipline
and
treat
a
man
as
a
and
he
becomes
a
had
been
the
logical
standpoint
of
the
amalgamated
union
of
policemen
and
plain
clothes
detectives
yes
replied
the
girl
and
her
voice
had
not
quite
that
agreeable
intonation
that
members
of
the
force
usually
hear
from
the
lips
of
fair
young
ladies
nowadays
do
you
wish
to
see
it
what
else
should
i
ask
you
if
you
had
one
for
he
demanded
with
the
innate
boorishness
of
the
man
of
course
i
want
to
see
it
she
opened
the
little
bag
that
hung
from
her
girdle
and
handed
him
a
paper
without
a
word
muriel
ursula
percy
sleigh
hampden
it
would
be
idle
to
pretend
that
the
names
pleased
him
or
that
he
tried
to
veil
his
contempt
yes
she
replied
he
indicated
his
private
disbelief
or
possibly
merely
took
a
ready
means
of
exercising
his
authority
in
a
way
that
he
knew
to
be
offensive
by
producing
a
small
tin
box
from
one
of
his
pockets
and
passing
it
to
her
without
any
explanation
the
requirement
was
so
universal
in
practice
however
that
no
explanation
was
necessary
for
the
signature
as
the
chief
mark
of
identification
had
long
been
superseded
by
the
simpler
and
more
effective
miss
hampden
made
a
slight
grimace
when
she
saw
the
condition
of
the
soft
wax
which
the
box
contained
but
she
obediently
pressed
it
with
her
thumb
and
passed
it
back
again
as
her
licence
bore
another
stamped
in
pigment
it
was
only
necessary
for
the
constable
to
compare
the
two
a
process
simplified
by
the
superimposing
glass
a
contrivance
not
unlike
a
small
with
converging
tubes
in
order
to
satisfy
himself
at
once
whether
the
marks
were
the
impress
of
the
same
thumb
apparently
they
were
for
with
a
careless
he
proceeded
on
his
way
swinging
his
truncheon
with
an
easy
grace
and
occasionally
striking
off
the
end
of
an
overhanging
branch
i
wonder
said
stobalt
when
at
length
the
zealous
officer
had
quite
disappeared
in
search
of
other
fields
for
tactful
activity
i
wonder
if
you
are
a
daughter
of
sir
john
hampden
yes
she
replied
looking
at
him
with
renewed
interest
his
only
daughter
do
you
know
my
father
he
shook
his
head
i
have
been
away
but
we
see
the
papers
sometimes
he
said
the
sir
john
i
mean
he
explained
as
though
the
point
were
a
matter
of
some
moment
was
a
few
years
ago
regarded
as
the
one
man
who
might
unite
our
parties
and
save
the
position
there
is
only
one
sir
john
hampden
she
replied
but
it
was
too
late
oh
yes
he
admitted
vaguely
dismissing
the
subject
both
were
silent
for
a
few
minutes
it
might
be
noticed
that
people
often
became
thoughtful
when
they
spoke
of
the
past
in
those
years
indeed
an
optimist
might
almost
have
had
some
ground
for
believing
that
a
thinking
era
had
begun
when
he
spoke
again
it
was
with
something
of
an
air
of
constraint
you
asked
me
just
now
if
there
was
anything
well
i
have
since
thought
yes
she
said
encouragingly
i
have
thought
that
i
should
like
to
meet
your
father
i
hear
everywhere
that
he
is
the
most
inaccessible
man
in
london
but
perhaps
if
you
could
favour
me
with
a
line
of
introduction
oh
yes
she
exclaimed
gladly
i
am
sure
that
he
would
wish
to
thank
you
i
will
write
i
have
paper
and
a
pencil
here
he
suggested
i
have
been
a
sailor
he
added
as
though
that
simple
statement
explained
an
omnipercipient
resourcefulness
as
perhaps
it
did
if
you
prefer
it
she
said
accepting
the
proffered
stationery
it
did
not
make
the
least
difference
she
told
herself
but
this
expedition
chilled
her
generous
instincts
i
leave
for
town
was
all
he
vouchsafed
for
a
few
minutes
she
wrote
in
silence
while
he
looked
fixedly
out
to
sea
what
name
am
i
to
write
please
she
asked
presently
oh
salt
george
salt
he
replied
in
a
voice
and
without
turning
his
head
is
it
salt
or
or
just
please
and
his
voice
fell
a
little
flat
in
spite
of
himself
but
he
did
not
meet
her
eyes
and
would
it
be
too
much
if
i
asked
you
to
mention
the
circumstances
under
which
we
met
she
bent
a
little
lower
over
the
paper
in
a
shame
she
could
not
then
define
i
will
not
fail
to
let
my
father
know
how
heroic
you
have
been
and
to
what
an
extent
we
are
indebted
to
you
she
replied
dispassionately
thank
you
suddenly
he
turned
with
an
arresting
gesture
and
impulsive
speech
trembled
on
his
tongue
but
the
sophistries
of
explanation
apology
were
foreign
to
the
nature
of
this
strong
man
whose
grey
and
not
unkindly
eyes
had
gained
their
tranquil
depth
from
long
intercourse
with
sea

never

being
cried
in
the
streets
of
the
old

port
as
george
salt
walked
to
the
station
a
few
hours
later
a
general
election
was
drawing
to
its
desultory
close
but
the
results
seemed
to
excite
curiously
little
interest
among
the
leisured
class
that
filled
the
promenades
it
was
a
longer
sweep
of
the
pendulum
than
had
ever
been
anticipated
in
the
days
when
politics
were
more
or
less
the
pastime
of
the
rich
and
the
working
classes
neither
understood
nor
cared
to
understand
them
only
understood
that
whatever
else
happened
nothing
ever
came
their
way

man
who
had
been
a

two
papers
of
very
different

orthodox

organ

there

to

position
it
lends
itself
to
summary
the
labour
party
had
come
into
power
by
pointing
out
to
voters
of
the
working
classes
that
its
members
were
their
brothers
and
promising
them
a
great
deal
of
property
belonging
to
other
people
and
a
good
many
privileges
which
they
vehemently
denounced
in
every
other
class
when
in
power
they
had
thrown
open
the
doors
of
election
to
one
and
all
the
socialist
party
had
come
into
power
by
pointing
out
to
voters
of
the
working
classes
that
its
members
were
even
more
their
brothers
and
promising
them
a
still
larger
share
of
other
people
property
some
indeed
belonging
to
the
more
prosperous
of
the
labour
representatives
then
in
office
and
still
greater
privileges
yet
the
editor
of
was
both
pained
and
surprised
at
the
result
chapter
iv
the
compact
a
strong
man
and
a
prominent
politician
sir
john
hampden
had
occupied
the
unfamiliar
position
in
parliament
of
belonging
to
no
party
to
no
party
that
is
as
the
term
had
then
been
current
in
english
politics
for
more
discerning
than
most
of
his
contemporaries
he
had
foreseen
the
obliteration
of
the
existing
boundaries
and
the
phenomenal
growth
of
purely
class
politics
even
in
the
old
century
it
was
he
recognised
to
be
that
development
of
the
franchise
with
which
the
world
was
later
to
become
tolerably
familiar
civil
war
on
constitutional
lines
his
warnings
fell
on
very
stony
ground
the
powers
that
had
never
yet
prepared
for
war
abroad
until
the
enemy
had
comfortably
occupied
all
the
strategic
points
lest
they
should
wound
some
wily
protesting
old
gentleman
susceptibilities
were
scarcely
likely
to
take
time
by
the
forelock
or
even
by
a
hind
fetlock
to
enlarge
the
comparison
at
home
while
the
labour
party
was
bringing
pressure
upon
the
government
of
the
day
to
grant
an
extension
of
suffrage
that
made
labour
the
master
of
eight
out
of
every
ten
constituencies
the
two
great
classical
parties
were
quarrelling
vehemently
whether
should
be
spent
upon
a
sanatorium
at
hai
yang
and
upon
a
dockyard
at
pittiescottie
or
upon
a
dockyard
at
hai
yang
and
upon
a
sanatorium
at
pittiescottie
when
it
is
added
that
the
labour
party
was
definitely
pledged
to
the
inauguration
of
universal
peace
by
declining
to
go
to
war
on
any
provocation
and
looked
towards
wholesale
disarmament
as
the
first
means
of
economy
on
attaining
office
the
cataclysmal
humour
of
the
situation
becomes
apparent
they
attained
office
as
it
has
been
seen
thanks
largely
to
the
great
liberal
party
whom
they
succeeded
the
great
liberal
party
like
the
editor
of
some
years
later
was
pained
and
surprised
at
this
ingratitude
the
great
liberal
party
had
never
contemplated
such
a
development
and
through
thick
and
thin
had
insisted
upon
regarding
the
labour
party
as
its
ally
notwithstanding
the
fact
that
the
ally
had
always
laughed
uproariously
at
the
alliance
and
had
pleasantly
announced
its
intention
of
strewing
westminster
with
the
wreckage
of
all
existing
capitalistic
parties
when
once
it
was
strong
enough
to
do
so
little
wonder
that
that
great
liberal
administration
was
destined
to
pass
down
to
future
ages
as
the
house
of
pathetic
fools
posterity
adjudicated
that
no
greater
example
of
servile
fatuousness
could
be
produced
this
was
unjust
for
on
june
louis
certainly
let
it
be
admitted
harder
pressed
had
accepted
a
red
cap
of
liberty
and
putting
it
on
in
obedience
to
the
command
of
the
extreme
party
of
his
time
had
bowed
right
and
left
with
ingratiating
friendliness
while
a
labour
gentleman
bearing
upon
a
pike
a
raw
cow
heart
labelled
the
heart
of
an
aristocrat
roared
out
with
his
twenty
thousand
friends
an
amused
approval
it
was
out
of
the
material
of
the
two
great
traditional
parties
that
sir
john
hampden
tried
to
create
his
class
coalition
to
meet
the
new
conditions
the
spectacle
of
working
men
suddenly
dropping
party
differences
and
merging
into
a
solid
phalanx
of
labour
was
before
their
eyes
but
the
tories
were
disintegrated
and
inert
the
whigs
and
the
years
of
grace
just
so
many
years
as
sir
john
was
before
his
contemporaries
passed
then
came
a
brief
period
desperate
indeed
but
not
hopeless
while
something
might
yet
be
done
but
the
leaders
of
the
historical
parties
were
waiting
for
some
happy
chance
by
which
they
might
retract
and
yet
preserve
their
dignity
it
was
during
this
crisis
that
the
party
whose
idea
of
dignity
was
symbolised
by
the
escort
of
a
brass
band
on
a
cart
abolished
the
house
of
lords
suspended
the
naval
programme
and
confiscated
all
ecclesiastical
landed
property
panic
reigned
but
there
could
be
no
appeal
for
the
party
in
power
had
never
concealed
their
aims
and
aspirations
and
now
that
they
had
been
returned
they
were
only
carrying
out
their
promises
that
is
putting
their
position
so
mildly
as
to
be
almost
unjust
they
were
indeed
among
political
parties
the
only
one
immaculate
and
beyond
reproach
all
others
had
trimmed
and
whittled
promised
and
recalled
sworn
and
forsworn
till
political
assurances
were
emptier
than
libertines
vows
the
socialists
had
nailed
their
manifesto
to
the
mast
and
no
man
could
charge
them
with
duplicity
on
every
platform
from
caithness
to
cornwall
they
had
stood
openly
and
declared
we
are
the
enemies
to
capital
we
are
at
war
with
society
as
it
is
at
present
constituted
we
are
for
the
forcible
distribution
of
wealth
however
come
by
the
abolition
of
class
distinctions
and
the
levelling
of
humanity
with
the
unskilled
labourer
as
the
ideal
standard
good
fellows
all
had
in
effect
declared
their
liberal
allies
and
they
do
not
really
mean
that
not
phraseologically
accurately
that
is
we
go
in
for
a
little
say
ourselves
at
election
times
and
when
these
excellent
men
are
in
parliament
the
refining
influence
of
the
surroundings
will
tone
them
down
wonderfully
and
they
will
turn
out
thoroughly
moderate
and
conciliatory
members
do
you
make
any
error
about
that
comrades
the
candidates
had
replied
and
with
a
candour
unparalleled
in
the
history
of
electioneering
they
had
not
merely
hinted
this
or
said
it
among
themselves
but
had
freely
and
honourably
proclaimed
it
to
the
four
winds
if
you
like
to
help
us
just
now
that
your
affair
and
we
are
quite
willing
to
profit
by
it
but
if
you
knew
what
you
were
doing
you
would
go
home
and
all
have
the
nightmare
so
naïve
smiled
the
great
liberal
party
suppose
they
have
to
talk
like
that
at
present
to
please
the
unemployed
then
came
the
deluge
sir
john
hampden
could
have
every
section
of
the
middle
and
upper
class
political
parties
to
lead
if
he
so
deigned
but
wherever
else
he
might
lead
them
there
was
no
possible
hope
of
it
being
to
stephen
it
was
as
his
daughter
had
said
then
too
late
labour
members
of
one
complexion
or
another
had
captured
of
the
constituencies
and
there
was
not
the
slightest
chance
of
ousting
them
so
it
came
about
that
in
less
than
a
decade
from
the
first
alarm
the
extremity
of
the
patriot
hope
was
that
in
perhaps
twenty
years
time
when
the
country
was
reduced
to
bankruptcy
and
the
position
of
a
third
class
power
and
when
there
was
no
more
property
to
confiscate
in
the
interest
of
the
working
class
voter
a
popular
rising
or
a
foreign
invasion
might
again
place
a
responsible
administration
in
power
but
in
the
meantime
the
organisations
of
the
old
parties
fell
to
pieces
the
parties
themselves
ceased
to
be
powers
their
leaders
were
half
forgotten
sir
john
hampden
might
still
be
a
rallying
point
if
he
raised
a
standard
in
a
time
of
renewed
hope
but
there
was
no
hope
and
sir
john
was
reported
to
have
broken
his
staff
drowned
his
books
and
cut
himself
off
from
politics
in
the
bitterness
of
his
indignation
and
impotent
despair
it
was
in
something
very
like
this
mood
that
george
salt
found
him
and
it
was
an
issue
of
the
mood
that
would
have
made
him
inaccessible
to
a
less
resourceful
man
day
after
day
he
had
denied
himself
to
his
old
associates
and
little
disappointed
hucksters
who
were
anxious
to
betray
their
party
for
their
conscience
sake
provided
there
was
a
definite
offer
of
a
more
lucrative
position
in
a
new
party
vainly
shadowed
his
doorway
with
cabals
in
their
but
the
man
who
had
been
a
sailor
and
spoke
few
words
had
an
air
that
carried
where
fluency
and
failed
even
then
almost
at
his
first
words
sir
john
would
have
closed
the
subject
definitely
and
without
discussion
politics
do
not
concern
me
mr
salt
he
said
rising
with
an
angry
flash
in
the
eyes
whose
fighting
light
gave
the
lie
to
the
story
of
abandoned
hope
if
that
is
your
business
you
have
reached
me
by
a
subterfuge
having
reached
you
replied
salt
unmoved
will
you
allow
me
to
put
my
suggestions
before
you
i
have
no
doubt
that
they
are
interesting
replied
the
baronet
falling
into
smooth
indifference
but
as
you
may
see
i
am
exclusively
devoted
to
euplexoptera
now
it
might
be
true
for
the
table
before
him
was
covered
with
specimens
scientific
instruments
and
entomological
works
while
not
even
a
single
newspaper
betrayed
an
interest
in
the
day
but
a
world
of
bitterness
smouldered
beneath
his
admission
if
he
continued
in
the
same
vein
you
have
an
idea
for
an
effective
series
of
magic
lantern
slides
you
will
find
the
offices
of
the
union
of
imperial
agencies
in
whitehall
the
first
act
to
which
the
new
government
was
pledged
was
the
evacuation
of
egypt
and
the
mighty
counterblast
from
the
headquarters
of
the
remnant
of
the
great
opposing
organisation
was
it
should
be
explained
a
travelling
magic
lantern
van
designed
to
satisfy
rural
voters
as
to
the
present
happy
condition
of
the
fellahin
possibly
you
would
hardly
complain
that
i
am
not
prepared
to
go
far
enough
replied
the
visitor
but
in
order
to
discuss
that
i
must
have
your
serious
attention
i
have
already
expressed
myself
replied
sir
john
formally
i
am
not
interested
if
you
will
hear
me
out
and
then
repeat
that
i
will
go
urged
salt
with
desperate
calmness
yet
i
have
thrown
up
the
profession
of
my
life
because
i
hold
that
there
is
a
certain
remedy
and
i
have
come
a
hundred
miles
to
offer
it
to
you
for
you
are
the
man
realise
that
i
am
vitally
concerned
i
am
very
sorry
replied
sir
john
courteously
but
without
the
faintest
encouragement
but
the
matter
is
beyond
me
leave
me
and
try
some
younger
less
disillusionised
man
there
is
no
other
man
who
will
serve
my
purpose
sir
john
stared
hard
as
well
he
might
others
had
not
been
in
the
habit
of
appealing
to
him
to
serve
their
purposes
you
are
the
natural
leader
of
our
classes
you
alone
can
inspire
them
you
alone
have
the
authority
to
call
them
to
any
effort
i
have
been
invited
to
lead
a
hundred
forlorn
hopes
replied
sir
john
a
dozen
years
nine
years
aye
perhaps
even
six
years
ago
any
one
of
them
might
have
been
sufficient
now
i
have
my
earwigs
good
night
mr
salt
the
dismissal
was
so
unmistakably
final
that
the
most
stubborn
persistence
could
scarcely
ignore
it
mr
salt
rose
but
only
to
approach
the
table
by
which
sir
john
was
standing
i
wished
to
have
you
with
me
on
the
bare
merits
of
my
plan
he
said
in
a
low
voice
but
you
would
not
but
you
shall
save
england
in
spite
of
your
dead
heart
read
this
letter
for
a
moment
it
seemed
doubtful
how
hampden
would
take
so
brusque
a
demand
another
second
and
he
might
have
imperiously
ordered
salt
to
leave
the
house
when
his
eyes
fell
with
a
start
upon
the
writing
thrust
before
him
and
taking
the
letter
in
his
hand
he
read
it
through
read
it
twice
little
fool
he
said
so
low
that
it
sounded
tenderly
poor
little
fool
then
aloud
am
i
to
understand
that
you
have
saved
my
life
yes
replied
george
salt
and
even
the
tropical
sunburn
could
not
cover
his
hot
shame
at
great
personal
risk
to
yourself
again
the
reply
was
yes
without
an
added
word
why
did
you
not
let
me
know
of
this
before
does
that
matter
now
it
had
been
his
master
card
but
a
very
humiliating
one
to
play
throughout
to
trade
upon
that
instinctive
heroism
to
assert
his
bravery
to
apprise
it
at
its
worth
and
to
claim
a
fit
return
no
admitted
sir
john
with
intuition
i
do
suppose
it
does
the
position
then
is
that
instead
of
exchanging
the
usual
compliments
applicable
to
the
occasion
i
express
my
gratitude
by
listening
to
your
views
on
the
political
situation
and
further
he
continued
with
the
same
gentle
air
of
irony
accepting
salt
silent
acquiescence
that
i
proceed
to
liquidate
my
obligation
fully
by
identifying
myself
with
a
scheme
which
you
have
in
your
pocket
for
averting
national
disaster
no
replied
salt
sharply
that
is
for
you
to
accept
or
reject
unconditionally
on
your
own
judgment
very
well
i
am
entirely
at
your
service
now
in
the
first
place
then
i
ask
you
to
admit
that
a
state
of
civil
war
morally
exists
and
that
the
only
possible
hope
for
our
existence
lies
in
adopting
the
methods
of
covert
civil
war
to
secure
our
ends
admit
good
god
i
have
been
shrieking
it
into
deaf
ears
for
half
my
life
it
seems
cried
sir
john
suddenly
stirred
despite
himself
they
called
me
the
phantom
hampden
heaven
knows
what
not
through
an
entire
decade
admit
go
on
mr
salt
i
accept
your
first
clause
more
easily
than
lord
stirling
swallowed
socialistic
amendments
to
his
own
bills
and
that
is
saying
a
great
deal
then
continued
salt
taking
a
bundle
of
papers
from
an
inner
pocket
and
selecting
a
docket
of
half
a
dozen
typewritten
sheets
from
it
i
propose
for
your
acceptance
the
following
plan
of
campaign
he
looked
round
the
littered
desk
for
a
vacant
space
on
which
to
lay
the
document
with
an
impetuous
movement
of
his
arm
sir
john
swept
books
trays
and
insects
into
one
chaotic
heap
and
spreading
the
summary
before
him
plunged
into
it
forthwith
chapter
v
the
downtrodden
kumreds
announced
mr
tubes
with
winning
familiarity
i
may
say
now
and
once
and
for
all
that
you
thoroughly
convinced
of
the
justice
of
your
claims
but
that
is
saying
that
the
thing
as
good
as
done
so
do
go
slinging
it
broadcast
in
the
next
pub
you
come
to
there
our
good
kumred
the
chancellor
of
the
exchequer
to
be
taken
into
account
and
while
i
about
it
let
me
tell
you
straight
that
these
cabinet
jobs
whether
at
twenty
fifty
or
a
hundred
quid
a
week
the
softest
things
going
as
some
of
you
chaps
seem
to
imagine
swap
you
mate
then
called
out
a
facetious
fireman
yus
and
throw
the
missis
and
kids
into
the
bargain
call
it
a
deal
in
his
modest
little
house
the
right
hon
james
tubes
secretary
of
state
for
the
home
department
was
receiving
a
deputation
success
said
his
friends
had
not
spoiled
him
others
admitted
that
success
had
not
changed
him
from
the
time
of
his
first
appearance
in
parliament
he
had
been
dubbed
honest
jim
perhaps
a
somewhat
empty
compliment
in
view
of
the
fact
that
every
labour
constituency
had
barbed
unconscious
satire
at
its
own
expense
by
distinguishing
its
representative
as
honest
tom
dick
or
harry
and
after
his
elevation
to
cabinet
rank
he
still
remained
honest
more
to
the
point
because
more
apparent
he
remained
unpretentious
it
is
true
that
he
ceased
to
wear
as
a
personal
concession
to
the
prime
minister
by
whose
side
he
sat
the
grimy
coal
miner
suit
in
which
he
had
first
appeared
in
the
house
to
the
captivating
of
all
hearts
but
more
fortunate
than
caractacus
he
escaped
envy
by
continuing
to
occupy
his
humble
villa
in
kilburn
the
expenses
of
a
cabinet
minister
even
in
a
socialist
government
must
inevitably
be
heavier
than
those
of
a
private
member
but
this
admirable
man
illustrated
the
uselessness
of
riches
by
continuing
to
live
frugally
but
comfortably
upon
a
tenth
of
his
official
income
according
to
intimate
rumour
he
prudently
invested
the
superfluous
against
a
rainy
day
in
the
securities
of
countries
where
socialism
was
least
rampant
mr
tubes
never
refused
to
see
a
deputation
and
when
their
views
had
been
laid
before
him
it
was
rare
indeed
that
he
was
not
able
to
declare
a
warm
personal
interest
in
their
objects
true
he
could
not
always
undertake
to
carry
their
recommendations
into
effect
as
a
minister
he
could
not
always
express
official
approval
of
them
but
they
were
rarely
sent
away
without
the
moral
support
of
that
wink
which
is
proverbially
as
significant
as
a
more
compromising
form
of
agreement
whether
the
particular
expression
of
the
great
voice
of
the
people
was
in
the
direction
of
the
state
adoption
of
zulu
orphans
or
the
compulsory
removal
of
park
palings
from
around
private
estates
the
deputation
could
always
go
away
with
the
inward
satisfaction
that
however
his
words
might
read
to
outsiders
on
the
morrow
they
knew
that
as
a
man
and
a
comrade
he
jim
tubes
was
with
them
heart
and
soul
it
costs
nothing
he
was
wont
to
remark
to
his
home
circle
referring
of
course
to
his
own
sympathetic
attitude
for
some
of
the
ingenuous
proposals
which
he
countenanced
were
found
in
practice
to
prove
very
costly
indeed
and
who
knows
what
may
happen
next
but
on
this
occasion
as
far
as
compliance
lay
within
his
power
there
had
been
no
need
for
mental
reservation
the
had
been
patient
under
capitalistic
oppression
in
the
past
they
were
convincing
now
in
argument
and
they
were
moderate
in
their
demands
for
the
future
it
was
no
væ
victis
that
these
sturdy
wearers
of
green
corduroy
trousers
held
out
to
their
employers
but
a
cheery
come
now
mates
fair
does
and
we
mess
along
somehow
till
the
next
strike
mr
drugget
introduced
the
deputation
it
consisted
of
railway
workers
of
all
the
lower
grades
with
the
exception
of
clerks
after
many
ineffectual
attempts
to
get
clerks
to
enter
the
existing
labour
ring
it
had
been
seriously
proposed
by
the
labour
wirepullers
who
loved
them
in
spite
of
their
waywardness
and
would
have
saved
them
and
their
votes
and
their
weekly
contribution
from
themselves
that
they
should
form
a
union
of
their
own
in
conjunction
with
shop
assistants
and
domestic
servants
when
the
clerks
of
whom
the
majority
employed
domestic
servants
directly
or
indirectly
in
their
homes
or
in
their
lodgings
laughed
slightly
at
the
proposal
when
the
shop
assistants
smiled
and
when
the
domestic
servants
giggled
openly
the
promoters
of
this
amusing
triple
alliance
cruelly
left
them
to
their
fate
thenceforward
pettishly
declaring
that
all
three
were
a
set
of
snobs
a
designation
which
they
impartially
applied
to
every
class
of
society
except
their
own
and
among
themselves
to
every
minute
subdivision
of
labour
except
the
one
which
they
adorned
it
devolved
upon
a
rising
young
greaser
in
the
service
of
the
great
northern
to
explain
as
spokesman
the
object
of
the
visit
under
the
existing
unfair
conditions
the
directors
of
the
various
companies
were
elected
at
large
salaries
by
that
unnecessary
and
parasitic
group
the
shareholders
while
the
workmen
the
true
creators
of
every
penny
of
income
had
no
direct
hand
in
the
management
of
affairs
when
they
wished
to
approach
the
chief
authorities
it
was
necessary
for
them
to
send
delegates
from
their
union
who
were
frequently
kept
waiting
ten
minutes
in
an
and
although
of
late
years
their
demands
were
practically
always
conceded
without
demur
the
position
was
anomalous
and
humiliating
what
seemed
only
reasonable
to
them
then
was
that
they
should
have
the
right
to
elect
an
equal
number
of
directors
from
among
themselves
who
should
sit
on
the
board
with
the
other
directors
have
equal
powers
and
receive
similar
salaries
to
be
in
fact
your
permanent
deputation
to
the
board
suggested
the
home
secretary
that
it
with
powers
replied
the
man
there
be
some
soft
jobs
going
then
murmured
a
shunter
who
was
getting
on
in
years
reflectively
no
need
for
the
missis
to
take
in
young
men
lodgers
if
you
get
one
eh
bill
said
his
neighbour
jocosely
whether
it
was
the
extreme
unlikelihood
of
his
ever
being
made
a
director
or
some
other
deeper
cause
the
secret
history
of
the
period
does
not
say
but
bill
turned
upon
his
innocent
friend
in
a
very
aggressive
mood
what
mean
young
men
lodgers
he
demanded
warmly
what
call
have
you
to
bring
that
up
come
now
why
mate
expostulated
the
offending
one
mildly
no
one
said
anything
to
give
any
offence
what
the
your
missis
does
take
in
lodgers
same
as
plenty
more
do
she
well
then
i
can
take
a
along
the
lines
as
well
as
any
other
replied
bill
darkly
it
gone
far
enough
between
pals
see
i
never
said
anything
about
your
sister
leaving
that
there
laundry
did
i
never
i
did
and
what
about
it
if
you
did
demanded
the
neighbour
growing
hot
in
his
turn
i
should
think
you
have
enough
gentlemen
gentlemen
expostulated
the
glib
young
spokesman
as
the
voices
rose
above
the
conversational
whisper
let
us
have
absolute
unanimity
if
please
expressed
in
the
usual
way
by
all
saying
nothing
together
wha
matter
with
bill
murmured
the
next
delegate
with
polite
curiosity
seems
to
me
the
little
man
is
troubled
with
his
teef
replied
the
unfortunate
cause
of
the
with
smouldering
passion
strike
me
if
he
is
ah
and
seeing
the
impropriety
of
relieving
his
feelings
in
the
usual
way
in
a
cabinet
minister
private
study
he
relapsed
into
bitter
silence
mr
tubes
having
expressed
his
absolute
approval
of
this
detail
of
the
programme
the
second
point
was
explained
why
it
was
demanded
should
the
provisions
of
the
employers
liability
act
apply
only
to
the
hours
during
which
a
man
was
at
work
furthermore
why
should
they
apply
only
to
accidents
supposing
said
mr
william
mulch
the
spokesman
in
question
that
a
bloke
went
out
in
a
social
way
among
his
friends
as
any
bloke
might
caught
the
and
got
laid
up
for
life
with
or
died
or
suppose
the
bloke
after
sweating
through
a
day
work
went
home
to
his
miserable
hovel
and
broke
his
leg
falling
over
the
carpet
or
poisoned
his
hand
opening
a
tin
of
sardines
they
looked
to
the
present
government
to
extend
the
working
of
the
act
so
as
to
cover
the
disablement
or
death
of
employés
from
every
cause
whatever
natural
death
included
and
wherever
they
might
be
at
the
time
under
the
present
unfair
and
artificial
conditions
of
labour
the
were
nothing
but
the
slaves
and
chattels
of
capitalists
and
it
was
manifestly
unfair
that
the
latter
should
escape
their
responsibilities
after
exploiting
a
man
labour
for
their
own
greedy
ends
simply
because
he
happened
to
die
of
hydrophobia
or
senile
decay
or
because
the
injury
that
disabled
him
was
received
outside
the
foetid
insanitary
den
where
in
exchange
for
a
bare
sordid
pittance
his
flesh
was
ground
from
his
bones
for
eight
hours
daily
the
right
hon
gentleman
expressed
his
entire
concurrence
with
this
provision
also
and
roused
considerable
enthusiasm
by
mentioning
that
some
time
ago
he
had
independently
arrived
at
the
conclusion
that
such
a
clause
was
urgently
required
before
the
next
point
was
considered
comrade
tintwistle
asked
permission
to
say
a
few
words
he
explained
that
he
had
no
intention
of
introducing
a
discordant
note
on
the
contrary
he
heartily
supported
the
proposal
as
far
as
it
went
but
and
here
he
wished
to
say
that
though
he
only
voiced
the
demands
of
a
minority
it
was
a
large
a
growing
and
a
noisy
minority
it
did
not
go
far
enough
the
contention
of
those
he
represented
was
that
the
responsibility
of
employers
ought
to
extend
to
the
wives
and
families
of
their
many
a
poor
comrade
was
sadly
harassed
by
having
to
keep
a
crippled
child
who
would
never
be
a
or
an
ailing
wife
who
was
incapable
of
looking
after
his
home
comfort
properly
they
were
fighting
over
again
the
battle
that
they
had
won
in
the
matter
of
free
meals
for
school
children
it
had
taken
years
to
convince
people
that
it
was
equally
necessary
that
children
who
did
not
happen
to
be
attending
school
should
have
meals
provided
for
them
and
even
more
necessary
to
see
that
their
mothers
should
be
well
nourished
it
had
taken
even
longer
to
arrive
at
the
logical
conclusion
that
if
free
meals
were
requisite
free
clothes
were
not
a
whit
less
necessary
no
one
nowadays
doubted
the
soundness
of
that
policy
yet
here
they
were
again
timorously
contemplating
while
the
insatiable
birds
of
prey
who
sucked
their
blood
laughed
in
their
sleeve
at
the
spectacle
of
the
british
working
men
hiding
their
heads
in
the
shifting
quicksand
of
a
paradise
the
signs
of
approval
that
greeted
this
proposal
showed
clearly
enough
that
other
members
of
the
deputation
had
sympathetic
leanings
towards
the
larger
policy
of
the
minority
mr
tubes
himself
more
than
hinted
at
the
possibility
of
a
personal
conversion
in
the
near
future
in
the
meantime
he
remarked
everything
is
on
your
side
your
position
is
logical
moderate
and
just
all
can
admit
that
although
we
may
not
all
exactly
agree
as
to
whether
the
time
is
ripe
for
the
measure
with
every
temptation
to
wipe
off
some
of
the
arrears
of
injustice
of
the
past
we
must
not
go
so
far
as
to
kill
the
goose
that
lays
the
golden
egg
how
do
you
make
that
out
demanded
an
unsophisticated
young
signalman
it
the
work
of
the
people
that
produces
every
penny
that
circulates
oh
just
so
replied
tubes
readily
that
is
the
real
point
of
the
story
it
was
the
grains
of
corn
that
made
the
eggs
and
the
goose
did
nothing
but
sit
and
lay
them
we
must
always
have
our
geese
he
turned
to
the
subject
in
hand
again
with
a
laugh
and
approved
a
few
more
modest
suggestions
for
abolishing
privileges
the
last
point
continued
the
spokesman
is
one
that
closely
concerns
the
principles
that
we
all
profess
i
refer
to
the
obsolete
and
humiliating
anachronism
that
with
a
government
pledged
to
the
maintenance
of
social
equality
in
office
at
any
hour
of
the
day
at
practically
every
railway
station
throughout
the
land
you
will
still
see
trains
subdivided
as
regards
designation
and
accommodation
into
first
second
and
third
classes
it
is
a
distinction
which
to
us
as
the
representatives
of
the
third
class
is
nothing
more
or
less
than
insulting
why
should
me
and
my
missis
when
we
travel
be
compelled
to
sit
where
the
accidents
generally
happen
and
have
to
put
up
with
eighteen
in
a
compartment
when
smug
clerks
and
saucy
ladies
maids
who
are
no
better
than
us
enjoy
the
comparative
luxury
of
only
fifteen
in
a
compartment
away
from
the
collisions
and
snide
financiers
and
questionable
duchesses
who
are
certainly
a
good
deal
worse
sit
in
padded
rooms
well
protected
front
and
rear
and
never
know
what
it
is
to
be
packed
more
than
six
if
that
is
class
distinction
i
should
like
to
know
what
is
it
is
gawd
help
us
that
we
wish
to
mix
with
these
people
or
that
we
envy
their
position
or
covet
their
wealth
such
motives
have
never
entered
into
the
calculations
of
those
who
have
been
foremost
in
socialistic
propaganda
but
as
thoughtful
and
units
of
an
integral
community
we
object
to
being
segregated
by
the
imposition
of
obsolete
and
arbitrary
barriers
we
do
resent
the
artificial
creation
of
social
grades
and
we
regard
with
antagonism
and
distrust
the
unjust
accumulation
of
wealth
in
the
hands
of
the
idle
and
incapable
few
but
if
this
is
the
standpoint
of
the
great
mass
of
the
democracy
to
us
of
the
amalgamated
unions
of
railway
workers
and
permanent
way
staffs
the
invidious
distinction
has
a
closer
significance
as
ordinary
citizens
our
sense
of
equality
is
outraged
by
the
demarcations
i
have
referred
to
but
as
our
work
often
places
us
in
a
temporary
subordination
to
the
occupants
of
these
first
and
second
classes
whom
we
despise
intellectually
and
resent
economically
we
incur
the
additional
stigma
of
having
to
render
them
an
external
deference
which
we
recognise
to
be
obsolete
and
servile
the
arden
and
avon
valley
case
which
earned
the
martyrdom
of
dismissal
for
william
jukson
and
ultimately
involved
forty
thousand
of
us
in
a
now
historic
strike
simply
because
that
heroic
man
categorically
refused
to
the
doddering
duke
of
pentarlington
any
other
title
than
the
honourable
appellation
of
is
doubtless
still
fresh
within
your
minds
we
lost
on
that
occasion
through
insufficiency
of
funds
but
the
ducal
portmanteau
over
which
william
jukson
took
his
memorable
stand
will
yet
serve
as
a
rallying
point
to
a
more
successful
issue
mr
mulch
paused
for
approbation
which
was
not
stinted
but
before
he
could
resume
a
passionate
little
man
who
had
been
rising
to
a
more
exalted
state
of
fervour
with
every
demand
suddenly
hurled
himself
like
a
human
wedge
into
the
forefront
of
the
proceedings
kumrids
he
exclaimed
breathless
from
the
first
with
your
kind
permission
i
would
say
a
few
words
embodying
a
suggestion
which
though
not
actually
included
in
the
agenda
is
quite
in
with
the
subject
before
us
wo
it
keep
suggested
a
tired
delegate
hopefully
the
suggestion
is
briefly
this
continued
the
little
man
far
too
enthusiastic
to
notice
any
interruption
that
as
a
tribute
to
william
jukson
sterling
determination
and
as
a
perpetual
reminder
of
the
issues
raised
we
forthwith
add
to
the
banners
of
the
amalgamated
unions
one
bearing
an
allegorical
design
consisting
of
two
emblematic
figures
struggling
for
the
possession
of
a
leather
portmanteau
with
the
words
surrender
beneath
the
whole
might
be
made
obvious
to
a
person
of
the
meanest
intelligence
by
the
inscription
and
ry
test
case
upholds
the
principles
of
social
democracy
and
vindicates
the
people
rights
running
round
why
should
he
be
running
round
asked
a
member
of
the
deputation
who
running
round
demanded
the
last
speaker
amenable
to
outside
influence
now
that
he
had
said
his
say
william
jukson
did
you
say
he
was
to
be
on
this
banner
vindicating
the
people
rights
running
round
he
stood
there
on
the
platform
man
to
man
so
i
always
heard
the
redoubtable
jukson
champion
cast
a
look
of
ineffable
contempt
upon
his
simple
brother
and
made
a
gesture
expressive
of
despair
all
he
said
and
sat
down
mr
mulch
resumed
his
interrupted
innings
the
suggestion
will
doubtless
receive
attention
if
submitted
through
the
proper
channels
he
remarked
a
little
coldly
it
was
one
thing
to
take
the
indomitable
jukson
under
his
own
ægis
quite
another
to
countenance
his
canonisation
at
a
period
when
strenuous
candidates
were
more
numerous
than
remunerative
niches
but
to
revert
to
the
subject
in
hand
from
which
we
have
strayed
somewhat
it
only
remains
for
me
to
say
that
all
artificial
distinctions
between
class
and
class
are
distasteful
to
the
people
at
large
detestable
to
the
powerful
unions
on
whose
behalf
we
are
here
and
antagonistic
to
the
interests
of
the
community
we
confidently
look
therefore
to
the
present
government
to
put
an
end
to
a
state
of
things
that
is
inconsistent
with
the
maintenance
of
practical
socialism
towards
this
proposal
also
mr
tubes
turned
a
friendly
ear
but
he
admitted
that
in
practice
his
sympathies
must
be
purely
platonic
for
the
time
at
least
in
truth
the
revenue
yielded
by
the
taxation
of
first
and
second
class
tickets
was
so
considerable
that
it
could
not
be
ignored
many
people
adopted
the
third
class
rather
than
suffer
the
exaction
and
the
receipts
of
all
the
railway
companies
in
the
kingdom
fell
considerably
to
the
great
delight
of
that
large
section
of
the
socialistic
party
that
had
not
yet
begun
to
think
but
the
majority
of
the
wealthy
still
paid
the
price
and
not
a
few
among
the
weak
aged
and
timorous
among
children
old
men
and
ladies
were
driven
to
the
superior
classes
which
they
could
ill
afford
by
the
increased
difficulty
of
finding
a
seat
elsewhere
and
by
the
growing
truculence
of
the
workmen
who
were
thrust
upon
them
in
the
thirds
for
more
than
a
decade
it
had
been
observed
that
when
a
seat
in
tram
or
train
was
at
stake
the
age
of
courtesy
was
past
but
a
new
burke
listening
to
the
conversation
of
those
around
might
too
frequently
have
cause
to
think
that
the
age
of
decency
had
faded
also
another
development
contributing
to
the
maintenance
of
the
higher
classes
was
the
fact
that
one
was
as
heavily
mulcted
if
he
turned
to
any
of
the
other
forms
of
more
exclusive
travelling
private
carriages
of
all
kinds
were
the
butt
of
each
succeeding
budget
even
bicycles
unless
owned
by
workmen
were
not
exempt
and
so
heavily
was
the
chancellor
hand
laid
upon
motor
cars
except
such
as
were
the
property
of
members
of
parliament
that
even
the
marquis
of
kingsbery
was
satisfied
and
withdrew
his
threat
to
haunt
the
portsmouth
road
with
an
elephant
gun
and
yet
despite
the
persistence
of
a
stuart
in
imposing
taxation
and
the
instincts
of
a
vespasian
in
making
it
peculiarly
offensive
the
treasury
was
always
in
desperate
straits
the
reason
was
not
far
to
seek
in
the
old
days
liberal
governments
had
at
times
proved
extravagant
tory
governments
had
perhaps
oftener
proved
even
more
extravagant
but
in
each
case
it
was
the
tempered
profusion
of
those
who
through
position
and
education
were
too
careless
to
count
their
pence
and
too
unconcerned
to
be
dazzled
by
their
pounds
the
labour
and
the
socialist
administrations
proved
superlatively
extravagant
and
there
is
nothing
more
irredeemable
than
the
spendthrift
recklessness
of
your
navvy
who
has
unexpectedly
come
into
money
the
beggar
was
truly
on
horseback
or
to
travel
with
the
times
he
had
set
off
in
his
motor
car
and
he
was
now
bowling
along
the
great
towards
the
sea
of
national
perdition
a
very
beggar
indeed
with
a
merry
hand
upon
the
high
speed
gear
i
am
with
you
heart
and
soul
therefore
declared
mr
tubes
as
a
man
and
as
a
member
of
the
cabinet
added
in
principle
but
the
contemplated
act
for
providing
state
maintenance
of
strikers
in
strikes
approved
of
by
the
board
of
trade
makes
it
extremely
undesirable
to
abolish
any
of
the
existing
sources
of
revenue
at
least
until
we
see
what
the
measure
will
involve
save
on
the
navy
then
growled
a
malcontent
in
the
rear
rank
we
have
already
reduced
the
navy
to
the
fullest
extent
that
we
consider
it
desirable
to
go
at
present
that
is
to
say
to
the
limit
equality
with
any
one
of
the
other
leading
powers
the
army
then
we
have
already
reduced
the
army
very
considerably
but
with
a
navy
on
the
lines
which
i
have
indicated
and
an
army
traditionally
weaker
at
the
best
than
those
of
the
great
military
powers
which
are
also
naval
powers
is
it
prudent
the
gesture
that
closed
the
sentence
clearly
expressed
mr
tubes
own
misgivings
on
the
subject
he
had
always
been
regarded
as
a
moderate
though
a
vacillating
man
among
his
party
and
the
reduce
everything
and
chance
it
policy
of
a
powerful
section
of
the
cabinet
disturbed
his
rest
at
times
why
halt
ye
between
two
opinions
exclaimed
a
clear
and
singularly
sweet
voice
from
the
doorway
temporise
not
with
the
powers
of
darkness
when
the
day
of
opportunity
is
now
at
hand
sweep
away
arms
and
armies
engines
of
war
and
navies
in
one
vast
and
irresistible
wave
of
universal
brotherhood
beat
the
swords
into
ploughshares
cast
your
guns
into
instruments
of
music
let
all
strife
cease
extend
the
hand
of
friendship
and
equality
not
only
man
to
man
and
class
to

but
nation
to
nation
and
race
to
race
make
a
great
feast
and
in
love
and
fellowship
compel
them
to
come
in
so
shall
you
inaugurate
the
reign
of
christ
anew
on
earth
every
one
looked
at
the
speaker
and
then
glanced
at
his
neighbour
with
amusement
contempt
enquiry
here
and
there
something
of
approval
in
his
eye
the
mad
parson
brother
ambrose
the
ragged
priest
st
ambrose
of
shadwell
ran
from
lip
to
lip
as
a
few
recognised
the
tonsured
barefoot
figure
standing
in
his
shabby
cassock
by
the
door
mr
tubes
alone
seated
out
of
the
range
of
whispers
and
a
victim
to
the
defective
sight
that
is
the
heritage
throughout
the
world
received
no
inkling
of
his
identity
and
assuming
that
he
was
a
late
arrival
of
the
deputation
sought
to
extend
a
gentle
conciliation
the
goal
of
complete
disarmament
is
one
that
we
never
fail
to
strive
for
he
accordingly
replied
but
our
impulsive
comrade
must
admit
that
the
present
is
hardly
the
moment
for
us
to
make
the
experiment
entirely
on
our
own
prudence
prudence
exclaimed
the
ragged
priest
with
flashing
vehemence
there
is
no
more
cowardly
word
in
the
history
of
that
black
art
which
you
call
statecraft
all
your
wars
all
your
laws
all
tyranny
injustice
inhumanity
all
have
their
origin
in
a
fancied
prudence
it
marks
the
downward
path
in
whitened
milestones
more
surely
than
good
intentions
pave
that
same
decline
dare
dare
dare
man
dare
to
love
your
brother
herod
was
prudent
when
he
sought
to
destroy
all
the
children
of
bethlehem
it
was
prudence
that
led
pilate
to
deliver
up
our
master
to
the
jews
the
deadly
of
prudence
marched
and
destroying
armies
from
the
east
and
from
the
west
through
every
age
formed
vast
coalitions
and
dissolved
them
treacherously
made
dynasties
and
flung
them
from
the
throne
it
led
pagan
rome
it
illumined
the
birth
of
a
faith
now
choked
in
official
bonds
it
danced
before
stricken
europe
lit
the
martyrs
fires
lured
the
cold
greed
of
commerce
and
now
hangs
a
sickly
beacon
over
westminster
but
prudence
never
raised
the
fallen
magdalene
nor
forgave
the
dying
thief
christ
was
not
christ
who
said
a
man
who
had
a
reputation
for
facetiousness
to
maintain
oh
i
remember
been
dead
a
long
time
ambrose
turned
on
him
the
face
that
led
men
and
the
eye
that
quelled
my
brother
he
almost
whispered
across
the
room
if
you
die
with
that
in
your
heart
it
were
better
for
you
that
he
had
never
lived
there
was
something
in
the
voice
the
look
the
presence
that
checked
the
ready
methods
by
which
a
hostile
intruder
was
wont
to
be
expelled
all
recognised
a
blind
inspired
devotion
beside
which
their
own
party
enthusiasm
was
at
the
best
pale
and
thin
even
to
men
who
were
wholly
indifferent
to
the
forms
of
religion
ambrose
life
his
ascetic
discipline
his
fanatical
his
noble
almost
royal
family
and
the
magnetic
influence
which
he
exercised
over
masses
of
the
most
wretched
of
the
poor
and
degraded
gave
pause
for
thought
and
often
extorted
a
grudging
regard
not
a
few
among
those
who
had
dispassionately
watched
the
rise
and
fall
of
parties
held
the
opinion
that
the
man
might
yet
play
a
wildly
prominent
part
in
the
destinies
and
involve
a
tragedy
that
could
only
yet
be
dimly
guessed
for
most
men
deemed
him
mad
whatever
you
may
wish
to
say
this
is
neither
the
time
nor
the
place
said
mr
drugget
mildly
we
are
not
taking
part
in
a
public
meeting
which
invites
discussion
but
are
here
in
a
capacity
to
confer
with
the
home
secretary
there
is
no
time
or
place
unseasonable
to
me
who
come
with
supreme
authority
replied
ambrose
nor
if
the
man
is
worthy
of
his
office
can
the
home
secretary
close
his
ears
to
the
representative
of
the
people
the
people
exclaimed
a
startled
member
of
the
amalgamated
unions
what
mean
by
the
of
the
people
are
the
representatives
of
the
people
we
the
people
you
replied
ambrose
scornfully
sweeping
the
assembly
with
his
eye
and
returning
finally
with
a
disconcerting
gaze
to
the
man
who
spoke
you
smug
easy
in
your
little
way
band
of
pharisees
the
people
of
the
earth
are
you
the
poor
are
you
the
meek
the
hungry
the
persecuted
you
are
the
comfortable
complacent
of
labourdom
you
can
never
inherit
the
kingdom
of
christ
on
earth
outside
your
gates
despised
of
all
stand
his
chosen
people
there
was
a
low
rolling
murmur
of
approval
growing
in
volume
before
it
died
away
but
it
rose
not
within
the
chamber
but
from
the
road
outside
mr
tubes
whispered
the
introducer
of
the
deputation
uneasily
give
the
word
sir
shall
we
have
this
man
put
out
no
no
muttered
tubes
with
his
eyes
fixed
on
the
window
and
turning
slightly
pale
wait
a
minute
who
are
those
outside
the
member
of
parliament
looked
out
others
were
looking
too
and
for
a
moment
not
only
their
own
business
was
forgotten
but
the
indomitable
priest
outspoken
challenge
passed
unheeded
in
a
curious
contemplation
of
his
following
at
that
period
the
sight
was
a
new
one
in
the
streets
of
london
though
afterwards
it
became
familiar
enough
not
only
in
the
capital
but
to
the
inhabitants
of
every
large
town
and
city
throughout
the
land
ambrose
had
been
called
the
ragged
priest
and
it
was
a
very
ragged
regiment
that
formed
his
bodyguard
he
was
the
mad
parson
and
an
ethereal
mania
shone
in
the
faces
of
many
of
his
followers
though
as
many
sufficiently
betrayed
the
cunning
the
inborn
brutishness
of
the
unchanged
criminal
and
the
hooligan
thinly
cloaked
beneath
a
shifty
mask
of
assumed
humility
as
became
st
ambrose
the
banners
which
here
and
there
stood
out
above
the
ranks
mere
sackcloth
standards
lashed
to
the
roughest
poles
nearly
all
bore
religious
references
in
their
crude
emblems
and
sprawling
inscriptions
the
gibes
at
charity
the
demands
for
work
of
an
earlier
decade
had
given
place
to
another
phase
christ
is
mocked
was
one
having
all
things
in
common
ran
another
while
as
it
was
in
the
beginning
equality
in
christ
thy
kingdom
come
might
frequently
be
seen
but
a
more
significant
note
was
struck
by
an
occasional
threat
veiled
beneath
a
text
as
the
sun
shall
be
turned
into
darkness
the
moon
into
blood
though
their
leader
himself
never
hinted
violence
in
his
most
impassioned
flights
among
the
upturned
faces
a
leisurely
observer
might
have
detected
a
few
that
were
still
conspicuous
in
refinement
despite
their
sordid
settings
women
chiefly
and
for
the
most
part
fanatical
converts
who
had
been
swept
off
their
feet
by
ambrose
eloquence
in
the
more
orthodox
days
when
he
had
thrilled
fashionable
congregations
from
the
pulpit
of
a
mayfair
church
other
women
there
were
in
plenty
men
old
and
young
even
a
few
children
dirty
diseased
criminal
brutalised
vicious
crippled
the
unemployed
the
unemployable
beggars
from
the
streets
begging
on
a
better
lay
thieves
hopeful
of
a
larger
booty
malcontents
of
every
phase
enemies
of
society
reckoning
on
a
day
of
reckoning
the
unfortunate
and
the
unfortunates
swayed
by
vague
yearnings
after
righteousness
schemers
striving
for
their
private
ends
with
a
salting
of
the
all
held
together
so
far
by
the
vehement
personality
of
one
fanatic
and
glancing
down
the
ranks
one
could
prophesy
what
manner
of
monster
out
of
the
depths
this
might
prove
when
it
had
reached
rampant
maturity
poverty
abject
poverty
was
the
dominant
note
for
all
who
marched
beneath
the
ragged
banner
must
go
in
rags
mr
drugget
was
the
first
to
recover
himself
look
here
he
said
turning
to
ambrose
aggressively
i
do
quite
catch
on
to
your
game
but
that
neither
here
nor
there
if
you
want
to
know
what
i
call
it
i
call
it
a
bit
of
blasted
impertinence
to
bring
a
mob
like
that
to
a
man
private
house
no
matter
who
he
may
be
what
more
this
is
an
unlawful
gathering
according
to
act
of
parliament
that
which
breaks
no
divine
commandment
can
not
be
unlawful
replied
ambrose
unmoved
i
recognise
no
other
law
and
you
who
call
yourselves
socialists
and
claim
equality
what
are
your
laws
but
the
old
privileges
which
you
denounced
in
others
extended
to
include
yourselves
what
your
equality
but
the
spoliation
of
those
above
you
we
are
practical
socialists
exclaimed
one
or
two
members
with
dignity
as
reasonable
men
we
recognise
that
there
must
be
a
limit
somewhere
practical
is
the
last
thing
you
can
claim
to
be
you
are
impractical
visionaries
for
it
would
be
as
easy
for
a
diver
to
pause
in
as
for
mankind
to
remain
at
a
house
to
equality
all
all
every
distinction
must
be
swept
away
neither
proprietor
nor
property
paid
leader
nor
gain
nor
pride
of
place
nothing
between
god
and
man
heart
that
is
the
only
practical
socialism
and
it
is
at
hand
not
while
we
in
office
said
the
home
secretary
shortly
mene
mene
tekel
upharsin
cast
back
ambrose
where
is
now
the
great
unionist
party
in
a
single
season
the
sturdy
liberal
stronghold
crumbled
into
dust
you
deposed
a
labour
government
that
was
deemed
invulnerable
in
its
time
beware
the
hand
is
already
on
the
wall
those
forces
which
you
so
blindly
ignore
will
yet
combine
and
crush
you
it
was
not
unlikely
in
former
times
it
would
have
required
barricades
and
some
personal
bravery
but
with
universal
suffrage
the
power
of
the
pauper
criminal
was
no
less
than
that
of
the
ducal
millionaire
and
the
alcohol
lunatic
presenting
himself
at
the
poll
between
the
spasms
of
was
as
potent
a
force
as
the
philosopher
a
party
composed
of
paupers
aliens
chronic
unemployed
criminals
lunatics
unfortunates

hysterical
and
degenerate
of
every
kind
together
with
so
many
of
the
working
classes
as
might
be
attracted
by
the
glamour
of
a
final
and
universal
spoliation
led
by
a
sincere
and
impassioned
firebrand
might
yet
have
to
be
reckoned
with
and
you
comrade
said
a
with
pardonable
curiosity
when
you
had
your
little
fling
who
going
to
turn
out
and
come
in
we
exclaimed
ambrose
with
a
touch
of
genuine
surprise
how
can
you
be
so
blind
we
represent
the
ultimate
destiny
of
mankind
in
another
age
and
another
place
a
form
of
government
called
the
states
general
and
largely
composed
of
amiable
clerics
had
been
called
up
to
redress
existing
grievances
being
found
too
slow
it
gave
place
to
the
national
assembly
and
to
go
yet
a
little
faster
became
the
legislative
assembly
this
in
turn
was
left
behind
by
the
more
expeditious
girondins
but
as
even
they
lagged
according
to
the
bustling
times
the
jacobins
came
into
favour
the
ultimate
development
of
equality
was
reached
in
the
hébertists
from
one
to
another
had
been
but
a
step
and
they
were
all
the
people
but
while
the
states
general
had
looked
for
the
millennium
by
the
abolition
of
a
grievance
here
and
there
and
the
lightening
of
a
chafing
collar
in
the
mass
the
followers
of
hébert
found
so
little
left
for
them
to
abolish
that
they
abolished
god
the
experiment
convinced
the
sagest
of
the
leaders
that
human
equality
is
only
to
be
found
in
death
and
true
to
their
principles
they
equalised
a
million
of
their
through
the
instrumentality
of
the
guillotine
and
other
forms
of
moral
suasion
grown
more
the
people
no
longer
thirsted
for
another
section
of
the
people
blood
only
for
their
money
and
in
place
of
and
the
gentleman
with
the
wooden
frame
their
instruments
of
justice
were
represented
by
a
chancellor
of
the
exchequer
and
an
individual
delivering
blue
papers
we
represent
the
ultimate
destiny
of
mankind
absolute
equality
announced
ambrose
any
other
condition
is
inconsistent
with
the
professions
to
which
your
party
has
repeatedly
pledged
itself
will
you
my
brother
he
continued
addressing
himself
to
the
home
secretary
receive
a
deputation
the
deputation
was
already
waiting
at
the
outer
door
three
men
and
three
women
it
included
a
countess
a
converted
and
an
anarchist
who
had
become
embittered
with
life
since
the
premature
explosion
of
one
of
his
bombs
had
blown
off
both
his
arms
and
driven
him
to
subsist
on
the
charitable
the
other
three
were
uninteresting
nonentities
but
all
were
equal
in
their
passion
for
equality
we
are
all
pledged
to
the
principle
of
social
equality
and
every
step
in
that
direction
that
comes
within
the
range
of
practical
politics
must
have
our
sympathy
replied
mr
tubes
further
than
that
i
am
not
prepared
to
commit
myself
at
present
that
being
the
case
there
would
be
no
object
in
receiving
a
deputation
to
this
had
mr
tubes
come
at
last
the
unending
formula
said
brother
ambrose
with
weary
bitterness
bread
and
you
give
them
stones
man
he
cried
with
sudden
energy
almost
within
your
grasp
lies
the
foundation
of
new
jerusalem
tranquil
smiling
sinless
what
stands
in
your
way
nothing
nothing
truly
nothing
but
the
heavy
shadow
of
the
old
and
cruel
past
throw
it
off
is
it
not
worth
doing
no
more
spiritual
death
no
more
sorrow
of
the
things
of
this
world
nor
crying
shall
there
be
any
more
pain
for
the
former
things
are
passed
away
i
have
nothing
more
to
say
responded
the
home
secretary
coldly
bending
over
his
desk
to
write
then
i
have
much
more
to
do
retorted
ambrose
impetuously
and
that
shall
be
with
the
sword
of
my
mouth
he
strode
from
the
room
with
an
air
that
no
amount
of
legislative
equality
could
ever
confer
upon
any
of
those
he
left
behind
and
a
moment
later
his
ragged
escort
was
in
motion
homeward
slumward
kumreds
said
mr
tubes
looking
up
the
harmony
of
the
occasion
has
been
somewhat
impaired
by
an
untoward
incident
but
on
the
whole
i
think
that
you
may
rest
well
satisfied
with
the
result
of
your
representations
having
another
appointment
i
must
now
leave
you
but
i
have
given
instructions
for
some
beer
and
sandwidges
to
be
brought
in
and
i
trust
that
in
my
enforced
absence
you
will
all
make
yourselves
quite
at
home
he
shook
hands
with
each
man
present
and
withdrew
beer
and
sandwidges
muttered
comrade
tintwistle
with
no
affectation
of
delight
to
a
chosen
spirit
and
this
is
the
man
we
pay
fifty
quid
a
week
to
ah
assented
the
friend
following
mr
tubes
hospitable
directions
by
strolling
round
the
room
and
fingering
the
ornaments
well
when
it
comes
to
a
general
i
do
know
but
what
i
should
mind
having
this
here
little
round
barometer
for
my
parlour
neat
little

with

chapter
vi
miss
lisle
tells
a
long
pointless
story
sir
john
hampden
lived
within
a
of
the
marble
arch
george
salt
had
established
himself
in
westminster
and
about
midway
between
the
two
in
the
neighbourhood
of
pall
mall
a
convenient
but
quite
unostentatious
suite
of
offices
had
been
taken
and
registered
as
the
headquarters
of
the
unity
league
the
unity
league
was
a
modern
organisation
that
had
come
into
existence
suddenly
and
with
no
great
parade
within
a
week
of
that
day
when
george
salt
had
forced
hampden
to
hear
what
he
wished
to
say
a
day
now
nearly
two
years
ago
the
name
was
simple
and
commonplace
and
therefore
it
aroused
neither
curiosity
nor
suspicion
it
was
explained
by
the
fact
that
it
had
only
one
object
by
constitutional
means
to
obtain
an
adequate
representation
of
the
middle
and
upper
classes
in
parliament
a
phrase
rendered
by
the
members
colloquially
as
to
kick
out
the
socialists
the
government
quite
content
to
govern
constitutionally
in
the
wider
sense
and
to
be
attacked
constitutionally
in
the
narrower
sense
treated
the
existence
of
the
unity
league
as
a
playful
ebullition
on
the
part
of
the
milch
sections
of
society
and
raised
the
minimum
to
four
and
threepence
as
a
sedative
at
first
the
existence
of
the
league
met
with
very
little
response
and
no
enthusiasm
among
those
for
whom
it
was
intended
it
had
become
an
article
of
faith
with
the
oppressed
classes
that
no
propagandism
could
ever
restore
an
equitable
balance
of
taxation
every
change
must
inevitably
tend
to
be
worse
than
the
state
before
to
ask
the
working
classes
the
phrase
lingered
by
the
demarcation
of
taxation
it
meant
just
what
it
conventionally
means
and
similarly
it
excluded
clerical
workers
of
all
grades
to
ask
this
privileged
class
which
dominated
practically
every
constituency
to
throw
out
their
own
people
and
put
in
a
party
whose
avowed
policy
would
be
to
repeal
the
liability
act
extended
the
strikes
act
the
unemployed
act
the
amended
companies
act
the
ecclesiastical
property
act
the
infamous
necessity
act
and
a
score
of
other
preposterous
acts
of
injustice
before
they
even
gave
their
attention
to
anything
else
had
long
been
recognised
to
be
grotesque
a
league
therefore
which
spoke
of
working
towards
freedom
on
constitutional
lines
fell
flat
the
newspapers
noticed
it
in
their
various
individual
fashions
and
all
but
the
government
organs
extended
to
it
a
welcome
of
cold
despair
the
general
reader
gathered
the
impression
that
he
might
look
for
its
early
demise
the
first
revulsion
of
opinion
came
when
it
was
understood
that
sir
john
hampden
had
returned
to
public
life
as
the
president
of
the
league
what
his
name
meant
to
his
contemporaries
how
much
the
league
gained
from
his
association
may
be
scarcely
realised
in
an
age
existing
under
different
and
more
conflicting
conditions
briefly
his
personality
lifted
the
effort
into
the
plane
not
of
a
national
movement
for
with
the
nation
so
sharply
riven
by
two
irreconcilable
interests
that
was
impossible
but
certainly
beyond
all
cavil
as
to
motives
and
methods
when
it
was
further
known
that
he
was
not
lending
his
name
as
to
a
forlorn
hope
or
returning
reluctantly
as
from
a
tardy
sense
of
duty
men
began
to
wonder
what
might
lie
behind
the
first
public
meeting
of
the
newly
formed
league
deepened
the
impression
men
and
women
of
the
middle
and
upper
classes
were
invited
to
become
members
the
annual
subscription
being
a
guinea
none
but
adults
were
expected
those
of
the
working
class
were
not
invited
if
the
subscription
seemed
large
the
audience
was
asked
to
remember
what
lay
at
stake
and
to
compare
with
it
the
case
of
the
artisan
cheerfully
contributing
his
sixpence
a
week
to
the
strike
fund
of
his
class
as
a
result
there
is
a
strikes
act
now
in
force
the
president
reminded
them
and
the
artisan
no
longer
pays
the
cost
no
we
do
interjected
a
listener
i
ask
you
to
pay
it
for
three
years
longer
no
more
perhaps
less
replied
hampden
with
a
reassuring
smile
and
his
audience
stared
if
the
subscription
seemed
large
for
an
organisation
of
the
kind
the
audience
was
assured
that
it
was
by
no
means
all
or
even
the
most
that
would
be
expected
of
them
they
must
be
prepared
to
make
some
sacrifice
when
called
upon
the
nature
he
could
not
indicate
at
that
early
stage
no
balance
sheet
would
be
published
no
detailed
reports
would
be
issued
there
would
be
no
dances
no
no
club
houses
no
pretty
badges
the
president
warned
them
that
membership
offered
no
facilities
for
gaining
a
precarious
footing
in
desirable
society
through
the
medium
of
tea
on
the
vicarage
lawn
or
croquet
in
the
home
park
we
are
not
playing
at
tin
politics
nowadays
he
caustically
remarked
that
closed
the
exordium
in
a
different
vein
hampden
turned
to
review
the
past
and
with
the
chartered
freedom
of
the
man
who
had
prophesied
it
all
he
traced
in
broad
lines
and
with
masterly
force
the
course
of
conservative
ineptitude
radical
pusillanimity
labour
selfishness
and
socialistic
tyranny
what
would
be
the
crowning
phase
of
grab
government
history
foreshadowed
it
certified
it
before
the
dark
curtain
of
that
last
stupendous
act
the
wealth
and
wisdom
the
dignity
and
responsibility
of
the
nation
stood
in
paralysed
expectancy
there
was
a
telling
pause
a
dramatic
poignant
silence
hung
over
the
massed
crowd
that
listened
to
the
one
man
who
could
still
inspire
a
kindling
spark
of
hope
then
just
at
the
opportune
moment
a
friendly
challenge
gave
the
effective
lead
and
what
does
sir
john
hampden
offer
now
absolute
victory
replied
the
speaker
with
the
thrilling
energy
of
quiet
but
assured
conviction
and
with
it
the
ending
of
this
nightmare
dream
of
life
in
which
we
are
living
now
when
every
man
in
his
helplessness
shuns
his
own
thoughts
and
all
are
filled
with
a
new
unnatural
pain
the
shame
of
being
englishmen
blink
the
fact
or
not
it
is
civil
war
upon
which
we
are
now
engaged
votes
are
the
weapons
and
england
and
her
destiny
nothing
more
or
less
are
the
stakes
it
has
frequently
been
one
of
the
curious
features
even
of
the
most
desperate
civil
struggles
of
the
past
that
while
battles
were
raging
all
around
towns
besieged
and
thrones
falling
commerce
was
at
the
same
time
being
carried
on
as
usual
wordy
controversies
on
trivial
alien
subjects
were
being
hotly
discussed
by
opposing
sections
as
though
their
pedantic
differences
were
the
most
serious
matters
in
the
world
and
the
ordinary
details
of
everyday
life
were
proceeding
as
before
so
it
is
but
civil
social
war
is
in
our
midst
and
again
blink
it
or
not
we
are
losing
and
wage
it
as
it
is
being
waged
we
shall
continue
to
lose
i
am
not
here
to
urge
the
justice
of
our
cause
to
palliate
unwise
things
done
to
indulge
in
regrets
for
wise
things
left
undone
one
does
not
discuss
diplomacy
in
the
middle
of
a
battle
i
am
here
to
hold
out
a
new
hope
for
the
triumph
of
our
cause
for
the
revival
of
an
era
of
justice
for
the
recovered
respect
of
nations
i
have
never
been
accused
of
undue
optimism
yet
fully
weighing
my
words
i
stand
on
this
platform
to
share
with
you
my
conviction
that
it
is
within
our
power
in
three
years
time
to
send
an
overwhelming
majority
of
our
reconstructed
party
into
power
to
reduce
the
to
a
sane
and
normal
level
and
to
recommence
the
building
up
of
a
treasonably
neglected
navy
another
man
perhaps
any
other
man
would
have
been
met
by
ridicule
but
hampden
reputation
was
unique
the
one
point
of
emphasis
that
could
not
fail
to
impress
itself
upon
every
listener
was
that
there
something
behind
all
this
it
was
a
point
that
did
not
convey
itself
half
so
forcefully
in
the
newspaper
reports
so
that
as
socialists
and
their
friends
did
not
attend
the
meetings
even
as
members
of
the
wealthier
classes
had
ignored
socialistic
vapourings
in
days
gone
by
any
menace
to
the
government
that
the
league
might
contain
was
lost
on
them
for
the
present
it
was
the
moral
of
an
old
fable
the
dog
in
luxury
grown
slothful
and
unready
the
subscription
deterred
few
it
was
an
epoch
when
everything
was
apparently
being
given
away
for
nothing
though
never
had
the
grandfatherly
maxim
that
in
business
nothing
ever
is
offered
without
its
price
been
so
keenly
observed
but
superficially
to
ride
in
a
penny
entitled
one
to
a
probable
pension
for
life
to
buy
a
pound
of
tea
was
only
the
preliminary
to
being
presented
with
a
or
a
grand
piano
fortunes
lurked
in
cigarette
boxes
whole
libraries
sprang
gratuitously
from
the
columns
of
the
daily
papers
not
only
oxen
but
silver
spoons
inexhaustible
were
compressed
within
the
covers
of
each
jar
of
meat
extract
and
buried
treasure
mysterious
millionaires
and
men
littered
the
countryside
to
be
asked
to
subscribe
a
guinea
for
nothing
definite
in
return
was
therefore
a
pleasing
novelty
which
took
amazingly
so
too
the
idea
of
participating
in
some
sort
of
legal
revolution
which
would
entail
sacrifices
and
result
in
unexpected
developments
was
found
to
be
delightfully
invigorating
how
the
movement
spread
is
a
matter
of
history
incomes
had
been
reduced
wholesale
yet
so
great
was
the
confidence
in
hampden
name
that
many
members
sent
their
subscription
ten
times
told
when
he
asked
as
he
frequently
did
at
the
close
of
a
meeting
for
recruits
who
were
willing
to
devote
their
whole
time
unpaid
to
the
work
in
various
departments
more
than
could
be
accepted
were
invariably
forthcoming
all
members
proselytised
on
their
own
initiative
but
within
these
there
were
thousands
of
quiet
and
devoted
workers
who
were
in
close
touch
with
the
office
of
the
league
they
acted
on
detailed
instructions
in
their
methods
and
submitted
regular
reports
of
progress
and
of
the
state
of
public
feeling
in
every
part
of
the
kingdom
and
among
every
class
of
the
community
to
what
length
the
roll
of
membership
had
now
extended
only
two
men
knew
even
approximately
all
that
could
be
used
as
a
guide
was
the
fact
that
it
was
the
exception
rather
than
the
rule
anywhere
to
find
a
family
among
the
classes
aimed
at
that
did
not
contain
at
least
one
member
while
london
within
the
same
indicated
limits
had
practically
gone
solid
for
membership
and
george
salt
the
public
knew
nothing
of
him
his
name
did
not
appear
in
connection
with
the
league
nor
did
he
ever
take
a
place
among
the
notables
upon
the
platform
at
its
meetings
but
the
thousands
of
the
inner
ring
knew
him
very
well
and
few
whose
business
led
them
to
the
offices
missed
encountering
him
he
was
officially
supposed
to
be
a
league
secretary
to
sir
john
hampden
endowed
with
large
discretionary
powers
at
the
moment
when
this
chapter
opens
he
was
receiving
in
his
office
a
representative
of
the
leading
government
organ
a
daily
paper
which
purveyed
a
mixture
of
fervent
demagogism
and
inconsistency
for
the
modest
sum
of
one
halfpenny
as
it
was
called
was
widely
read
by
a
public
who
believed
every
word
it
contained
with
that
simple
credulity
in
what
is
printed
which
is
one
of
the
most
pathetic
features
of
the
mr
hammet
the
representative
of
had
come
to
find
out
what
was
really
behind
the
remarkable
spread
of
the
unity
league
possibly
members
of
the
government
were
beginning
to
fidget
salt
had
seen
him
for
the
purpose
of
telling
him
everything
else
that
he
cared
to
know
to
enquirers
the
officials
of
the
league
were
always
candid
and
open
and
laughingly
disclaimed
any
idea
of
a
mysterious
secret
society
so
salt
admitted
that
they
really
hoped
for
a
change
of
public
opinion
shortly
that
they
based
their
calculation
on
the
inevitable
swing
of
the
pendulum
and
so
forth
he
allowed
it
to
be
drawn
easily
from
him
that
they
had
great
faith
in
party
organisation
and
that
perhaps
between
themselves
and
not
for
publication
the
government
would
be
surprised
by
a
substantial
lowering
of
their
majority
at
the
next
election
as
a
result
of
quiet
unostentatious
spade
work
as
a
party
we
are
not
satisfied
with
the
state
of
things
he
said
we
can
not
be
expected
to
be
satisfied
with
it
and
we
are
certainly
relying
on
a
stronger
representation
in
opposition
to
make
our
views
felt
quite
right
said
mr
hammet
sympathetically
he
closed
the
in
which
he
had
made
a
few
entries
and
put
it
away
to
indicate
that
his
visit
was
officially
at
an
end
and
whatever
passed
between
them
now
was
simply
one
private
gentleman
talking
to
another
and
might
be
regarded
as
sacredly
confidential
salt
also
relaxed
the
secretarial
manner
which
he
had
taken
the
pains
to
acquire
and
seemed
as
though
he
would
be
glad
of
a
little
human
conversation
with
a
man
who
knew
life
and
fleet
street
which
meant
of
course
that
both
were
prepared
to
be
particularly
alert
i
was
at
one
of
your
meetings
the
other
night
the
albert
hall
one
remarked
the
newspaper
man
casually
your
chief
fairly
took
the
crowd
with
him
no
being
satisfied
with
a
strong
opposition
for
him
why
he
went
for
sweeping
the
country
and
going
in
with
a
couple
of
hundred
majority
or
so
salt
laughed
appreciatively
no
good
being
he
replied
that
was
the
end
of
all
the
old
organisations
see
no
hope
for
the
future
so
you
all
may
as
well
mark
time
was
their
attitude
and
they
dropped
out
anything
turns
up
we
intend
being
ready
for
it
so
come
in
now
we
say
seems
to
take
all
right
too
admitted
mr
hammet
i
was
offered
a
level
dollar
by
a
friend
of
mine
the
other
day
that
you
had
over
half
a
million
members
i
took
it
in
a
sporting
spirit
because
i
know
that
half
a
million
needs
a
lot
of
raking
in
and
i
put
it
at
rather
less
myself
but
of
course
as
you
are
close
about
it
we
can
never
settle
up
half
a
million
it
may
be
observed
was
everybody
property
as
an
estimate
on
excellent
authority
we
do
publish
figures
as
a
matter
of
fact
admitted
salt
but
i
do
know
why
there
should
be
any
very
particular
secret
about
it
oh
every
office
has
its
cupboards
and
its
skeletons
said
mr
hammet
generously
but
if
one
could
see
inside
he
added
with
a
knowing
look
i
think
that
i
should
win
no
exclaimed
salt
suddenly
i
do
mind
telling
you
in
confidence
we
have
passed
the
half
million
passed
it
last
well
some
time
ago
lucky
for
me
that
it
is
in
confidence
remarked
the
pressman
with
a
grimace
or
i
should
have
to
pay
up
what
is
the
exact
figure
then
he
ventured
carelessly
no
one
could
quite
tell
you
that
replied
salt
equally
six
hundred
thousand
suggested
mr
hammet
oh
that
is
a
considerable
advance
a
hundred
thousand
admitted
salt
with
transparent
disappointment
it
is
not
pleasant
when
you
have
impressed
your
man
to
have
him
expecting
too
much
the
next
minute
i
was
thinking
of
the
old
buttercup
league
said
mr
hammet
you
took
the
remains
over
lock
stock
and
barrel
i
believe
yes
all
that
would
come
half
belonged
to
your
party
really
and
half
of
the
remainder
were
children
what
an
organisation
that
was
in
its
time
a
million
and
a
half
the
smart
young
newspaper
man
noted
mr
salt
open
admiration
for
these
figures
it
convinced
him
that
the
newer
league
was
not
yet
within
measurable
distance
of
half
that
total
and
in
the
end
it
did
what
he
remarked
salt
was
bound
to
apologise
what
is
there
to
do
after
all
he
admitted
what
can
you
do
but
keep
your
people
together
show
them
where
their
interest
lies
and
wait
and
rake
in
the
shekels
suggested
mr
hammet
airily
oh
that
agreed
salt
a
little
uneasily
of
course
one
has
to
look
after
the
finances
agreed
mr
hammet
wish
i
had
the
job
do
you
smoke
here
as
a
general
thing
oh
yes
replied
salt
who
never
did
try
one
of
these
fairish
cigars
better
than
you
find
in
the
old
man
private
box
up
at
our
show
was
the
verdict
but
then
we
have
a
revenue
of
half
a
million
of
course
i
rely
on
you
not
to
say
anything
about
our
numbers
said
the
secretary
anxiously
the
visitor
made
a
reassuring
gesture
expressive
of
inviolable
secrecy
though
i
suppose
you
have
to
make
a
return
for
purposes
he
mused
my
aunt
what
an
item
you
must
have
no
replied
salt
we
do
not
pay
anything
mr
hammet
stared
in
incredulous
surprise
how
do
you
manage
to
work
it
he
demanded
familiarly
you
do
mean
that
they
have
forgotten
you
no
it
quite
simple
explained
salt
your
friends
made
the
funds
and
incomes
of
trades
unions
sacred
against
claims
and
taxes
of
every
kind
a
few
years
ago
and
we
rank
as
a
trade
union
do
call
them
my
friends
please
god
exclaimed
mr
hammet
with
ingratiating
disloyalty
i
work
as
in
a
house
of
bondage
you
publish
any
by
the
way
do
you
no
we
do
see
why
we
should
let
every
one
know
how
the
money
is
being
spent
no
matter
how
economically
things
are
carried
on
there
are
always
some
who
want
to
interfere
especially
if
they
sampled
your
weeds
suggested
the
visitor
pleasantly
pretty
snug
cribs
you
must
have
but
that
not
my
business
between
ourselves
what
does
sir
john
draw
a
year
nothing
protested
salt
eagerly
too
eagerly
as
president
of
the
league
he
does
not
receive
a
penny
sharp
mr
hammet
who
prided
himself
upon
being
a
terror
for
exposures
and
on
having
a
record
of
seven
flagrant
cases
of
contempt
of
court
read
the
secretary
eagerness
like
an
open
book
but
then
there
are
committees
executives
emergency
funds
and
what
not
he
pointed
out
and
our
unpaid
league
president
may
be
chairman
of
one
and
secretary
of
another
and
grand
master
of
a
third
with
a
royal
salary
from
each
eh
can
you
assure
me
oh
well
of
course
admitted
salt
cornered
beyond
prevarication
that
is
a
private
matter
that
has
to
do
with
the
officials
of
the
league
alone
but
you
may
take
it
from
me
that
every
one
in
these
offices
earns
his
salary
whatever
it
may
be
mr
hammet
smiled
his
polite
acquiescence
broadly
same
here
changing
the
scene
of
action
to
stonecutter
street
he
commented
do
you
happen
to
know
how
sir
john
came
to
start
this
affair
well
tagg
met
miss
hampden
once
and
wanted
to
marry
her
he
called
on
sir
john
who
received
him
about
as
warmly
as
a
shoulder
of
canterbury
lamb
even
before
he
knew
what
his
business
was
when
he
did
know
he
gave
such
an
exhibition
of
sheet
lightning
that
tagg
who
is
really
a
very
young
fellow
in
general
completely
lost
his
nerve
and
tried
to
dazzle
him
into
consenting
by
offering
him
a
safe
seat
in
the
huddersfield
division
and
a
small
place
in
the
government
if
he
consent
to
put
up
as
a
bracketted
imperialist
hyphened
socialist
then
the
old
man
kicked
tagg
out
of
the
house
and
swore
to
do
the
same
with
his
government
within
three
years
at
least
that
what
i
heard
about
the
time
but
very
likely
there
is
a
word
of
truth
in
it
a
tolerably
safe
inference
on
mr
hammet
part
as
in
point
of
fact
he
had
concocted
mr
tagg
romance
on
the
spur
of
the
moment
no
volunteered
salt
i
do
think
that
that
is
the
true
story
or
i
should
have
heard
something
about
it
it
rather
curious
that
you
should
have
mentioned
it
i
believe
but
it
scarcely
worth
taking
up
your
time
with
not
at
all
i
mean
that
i
am
quite
interested
protested
mr
hammet
well
of
course
it
sounds
rather
absurd
in
the
broad
light
of
day
but
i
believe
as
a
matter
of
fact
that
he
was
led
into
founding
the
league
simply
as
the
result
of
a
dream
a
dream
exclaimed
mr
hammet
deeply
surprised
what
sort
of
a
dream
well
it
naturally
must
have
been
a
rather
extraordinary
dream
to
affect
him
so
strongly
in
fact
you
might
perhaps
call
it
a
vision
a
vision
repeated
mr
hammet
thoroughly
absorbed
in
the
mysterious
element
thus
brought
in
do
i
understand
that
this
is
sir
john
own
explanation
hampden
sudden
return
to
activity
had
indeed
from
time
to
time
been
a
riddle
of
wide
interest
oh
no
salt
hastened
to
correct
i
expect
that
he
would
be
the
last
man
to
admit
it
or
to
offer
any
explanation
at
all
of
course
the
history
of
the
world
has
been
changed
in
every
age
through
dreams
and
visions
but
that
explanation
nowadays
in
a
weighty
matter
would
run
the
risk
of
being
thought
trivial
and
open
to
ridicule
but
what
do
you
base
your
deductions
upon
then
demanded
mr
hammet
rather
fogged
by
the
serious
introduction
of
this
new
light
is
sir
john
a
believer
in
clairvoyance
i
am
afraid
that
i
must
not
state
the
real
grounds
for
several
reasons
if
you
wo
think
me
discourteous
replied
salt
firmly
but
this
i
may
say
that
i
had
occasion
to
see
sir
john
late
one
night
and
then
he
had
not
the
faintest
intention
of
coming
forward
early
the
following
morning
i
saw
him
again
and
by
that
time
the
whole
affair
was
cut
and
dried
of
course
you
are
at
liberty
to
confirm
or
contradict
the
story
just
as
you
like
if
you
should
happen
to
come
across
it
again
in
a
state
of
conscious
bewilderment
through
which
he
was
powerless
to
assert
himself
mr
hammet
submitted
to
polite
dismissal
the
visible
result
of
his
interview
was
half
a
column
of
peptonised
personalities
in
rendered
still
easier
of
assimilation
to
the
dyspeptic
mind
by
being
well
cut
up
into
light
paragraphs
and
garnished
with
throughout
the
unseen
result
except
to
the
privileged
eyes
of
half
a
dozen
people
was
a
confidential
report
which
found
its
way
ultimately
into
the
desk
of
the
home
secretary
the
following
points
summarised
mr
hammet
deductions
the
unity
league
probably
has
a
membership
of
half
a
million
it
may
be
safely
assumed
that
it
does
not
exceed
that
figure
by
a
hundred
thousand
at
the
most
while
largely
recruiting
by
the
device
of
holding
out
a
suggestion
of
some
indefinite
and
effective
political
scheme
the
policy
of
the
league
will
be
that
of
and
its
influence
may
be
safely
ignored
very
little
of
its
vast
income
is
spent
in
propagandism
or
organisation
on
the
contrary
there
is
the
certainty
that
considerable
sums
are
lying
at
short
notice
at
the
banks
and
strong
evidence
that
equally
large
sums
have
been
sent
out
of
the
country
through
the
agency
of
foreign
houses
many
men
of
position
enjoy
obvious
sinecure
posts
under
the
league
and
all
connected
with
the
organisation
appear
to
draw
salaries
disproportionate
to
their
positions
and
in
some
cases
wildly
disproportionate
the
plain
inference
from
the
bulk
of
evidence
is
that
the
league
is
and
was
formed
to
be
the
preserve
for
a
number
of
extravagant
and
incapable
unemployed
of
the
upper
and
classes
who
have
organised
this
means
of
increasing
their
incomes
to
balance
the
diminution
which
they
have
of
late
years
experienced
through
the
equalising
legislation
of
socialism
the
money
sent
abroad
is
doubtless
a
reserve
for
a
few
of
the
higher
officials
to
fall
back
on
if
future
contingencies
drive
them
out
of
this
country
this
information
has
been
carefully
derived
from
a
variety
of
sources
including
john
hampden
secretary
a
man
called
salt
salt
appears
to
be
a
simple
unsuspicious
sort
of
fellow
and
with
careful
handling
might
be
used
as
a
continual
means
of
securing
information
in
the
future
should
there
be
any
necessity
the
simple
unsuspicious
secretary
had
dismissed
mr
hammet
with
scarcely
another
thought
as
soon
as
that
gentleman
had
departed
in
order
to
fit
himself
for
the
requirements
of
his
new
sphere
of
action
salt
had
during
the
past
two
years
compelled
himself
to
acquire
that
art
of
ready
speech
which
we
are
told
is
the
most
efficient
safeguard
of
our
thoughts
but
he
hated
it
most
of
all
he
despised
the
necessity
of
engaging
in
such
verbal
chicane
as
mr
hammet
mission
demanded
of
that
mission
he
had
the
amplest
particulars
long
before
the
representative
of
had
passed
his
threshold
he
knew
when
he
was
coming
why
he
was
coming
and
the
particular
points
upon
which
information
was
desired
he
could
have
disconcerted
hammet
beyond
measure
by
placing
before
him
a
list
of
all
those
persons
who
had
been
so
delicately
sounded
together
with
an
abstract
of
the
results
and
finally
he
received
as
a
matter
of
ordinary
routine
a
copy
of
the
confidential
report
three
hours
before
it
reached
mr
james
tubes
armies
engaged
in
active
warfare
have
their
intelligence
departments
and
the
secret
service
of
the
unity
league
was
remarkably
complete
and
keen
my
name
is
irene
lisle
said
the
next
caller
and
there
being
nothing
particular
to
say
in
reply
salt
expressed
himself
by
his
favourite
medium
silence
but
in
such
a
way
that
miss
lisle
felt
encouraged
to
continue
i
have
come
to
you
because
i
am
sick
of
seeing
things
go
on
as
they
have
been
going
for
years
and
no
one
doing
anything
i
believe
that
you
going
to
do
something
why
demanded
salt
with
quiet
interest
it
mattered
it
might
matter
a
great
deal
why
this
unknown
miss
lisle
should
have
been
led
to
form
that
conclusion
i
have
a
great
many
friends
some
in
london
others
all
over
the
country
i
have
been
making
enquiries
lately
through
them
and
also
by
other
means
it
is
generally
understood
that
your
membership
is
about
half
a
million
and
you
tacitly
assent
to
that
she
took
up
a
scrap
of
waste
paper
that
lay
before
her
and
writing
on
it
passed
it
across
the
desk
that
however
is
my
estimate
if
i
am
right
or
anything
like
it
you
are
concealing
your
strength
salt
took
the
paper
glanced
at
it
smiled
and
shook
his
head
without
committing
himself
to
any
expression
but
he
carefully
burned
the
fragment
with
its
single
row
of
figures
after
miss
lisle
had
left
i
have
attended
your
meetings
continued
miss
lisle
composedly
for
of
course
i
am
a
member
in
the
ordinary
way
i
came
once
as
a
matter
of
curiosity
or
because
one
friends
were
speaking
of
it
and
i
came
again
because
even
then
i
was
humbled
and
dispirited
at
the
shameful
part
that
our
country
was
being
made
to
play
before
the
world
i
caught
something
but
i
did
not
grasp
all
because
i
am
not
a
man
i
suppose
i
saw
meeting
after
meeting
of
impassive
unemotional
gentlemen
lifted
into
the
undemonstrative
of
purposeful
enthusiasm
by
the
suggestion
of
that
new
hope
which
i
failed
to
understand
at
one
of
the
earliest
queen
hall
meetings
i
particularly
noticed
a
young
man
who
sat
next
to
me
he
was
just
an
ordinary
gentlemanly
youth
who
might
have
been
anything
from
an
upper
clerk
to
a
millionaire
he
sat
through
the
meeting
without
a
word
or
a
sign
of
applause
but
when
at
the
finish
twenty
volunteers
were
asked
for
to
give
their
whole
time
to
serving
the
object
of
the
league
he
was
the
first
to
reach
the
platform
with
a
happier
look
on
his
face
in
the
stolid
english
style
than
i
should
have
ever
expected
to
see
there
it
was
beyond
me
then
among
the
audiences
one
frequently
heard
remarks
such
as
believe
something
behind
it
all
really
think
hampden
has
more
than
an
idea
strikes
me
that
we
are
going
to
have
something
livelier
than
tea
and
tennis
and
suggestions
of
that
kind
some
time
ago
after
a
meeting
at
kensington
i
was
walking
home
alone
when
you
overtook
me
immediately
in
front
were
two
gentlemen
who
had
evidently
been
to
the
meeting
also
and
they
were
discussing
it
at
that
moment
one
said
emphatically
to
the
other
do
know
what
it
is
but
that
it
something
swear
and
if
it
is
i
give
them
my
last
penny
sooner
than
have
things
as
they
are
sir
john
hampden
who
was
with
you
looked
at
you
enquiringly
and
you
shook
your
head
and
said
one
of
our
men
i
believe
it
beginning
to
take
already
he
replied
two
things
occurred
to
salt
that
miss
lisle
might
be
a
rather
sharp
young
lady
and
that
he
and
hampden
had
been
unusually
careless
anything
else
was
all
he
said
it
rather
a
long
wild
tale
and
it
has
no
particular
point
explained
the
lady
if
you
can
spare
the
time
he
urged
the
long
pointless
tale
might
be
a
pointer
to
others
beside
miss
lisle
i
was
cycling
a
little
way
out
in
the
country
recently
narrated
miss
lisle
when
i
found
that
i
required
a
spanner
or
i
could
not
go
on
it
was
rather
a
lonely
part
for
so
near
london
within
ten
or
twelve
miles
i
suppose
and
there
was
not
a
house
to
be
seen
i
wheeled
my
bicycle
along
and
soon
came
to
a
narrow
side
lane
it
had
a
notice
road
up
and
i
could
not
see
far
down
it
as
it
wound
about
very
much
but
it
seemed
to
be
well
used
so
i
turned
into
it
hoping
to
find
a
house
there
was
no
house
for
after
a
few
turns
the
lane
ended
suddenly
it
ended
so
to
speak
in
a
pair
of
large
double
doors
like
those
of
a
for
before
me
was
a
stream
crossed
by
an
iron
bridge
immediately
beyond
that
a
high
wall
and
the
doors
but
do
you
care
for
me
to
go
on
if
you
please
said
salt
and
paid
the
narrative
the
compliment
of
a
close
and
tranquil
attention
it
was
rather
a
peculiar
place
to
come
on
unexpectedly
continued
miss
lisle
it
had
originally
been
a
powder
works
and
the
old
notices
warning
intruders
had
been
left
standing
as
a
matter
of
fact
a
stranger
would
probably
still
take
it
to
be
a
powder
mill
but
one
learned
locally
that
it
was
the
depot
and
distributing
centre
of
an
artificial
manure
company
with
a
valuable
secret
process
which
of
course
made
it
less
interesting
than
explosives
and
less
dangerous
suggested
salt
smiling
i
do
know
shot
back
miss
lisle
with
a
glance
mark
the
precautions
there
was
the
stream
almost
enclosing
this
place
the
size
i
suppose
of
a
considerable
farm
and
in
the
powder
mill
days
it
had
been
completely
turned
into
an
island
by
digging
a
canal
or
moat
at
the
narrowest
point
of
the
bend
immediately
on
the
other
side
of
the
water
rose
the
high
brick
wall
topped
with
iron
spikes
the
one
bridge
was
the
only
way
across
the
stream
the
one
set
of
double
doors
as
high
as
the
wall
the
only
way
through
beyond
inside
was
thickly
wooded
i
suggest
wild
animals
you
know
but
savage
dogs
would
not
surprise
me
as
i
stood
there
concluding
that
i
should
have
to
turn
back
i
heard
a
heavy
motor
coming
down
the
lane
it
came
on
very
quickly
as
though
the
driver
knew
the
twisting
road
perfectly
shot
across
the
bridge
the
big
gates
fell
open
apparently
of
their
own
accord
and
it
passed
inside
i
had
only
time
to
note
that
it
was
a
large
trade
vehicle
with
a
square
body
before
the
gates
had
closed
again
miss
lisle
paused
for
a
moment
but
she
had
by
no
means
reached
the
end
of
her
pointless
adventure
i
had
seen
no
one
but
the
motor
driver
but
i
was
mistaken
in
thinking
that
there
was
no
one
else
to
see
for
as
i
stood
there
undecided
a
small
door
in
the
large
gate
was
opened
and
a
man
came
out
he
was
obviously
the
and
in
view
of
the
notices
i
at
once
concluded
that
he
was
coming
to
warn
me
off
so
i
anticipated
him
by
asking
him
if
he
could
lend
me
a
spanner
he
muttered
rather
surlily
that
if
i
waited
there
he
would
see
and
went
back
closing
the
little
door
behind
him
i
thought
that
i
heard
the
click
of
a
lock
presently
he
came
back
just
as
unamiable
as
before
and
insisted
on
screwing
up
the
bolt
himself
to
get
me
away
the
sooner
i
suppose
he
absolutely
started
when
i
naturally
enough
offered
him
sixpence
i
imagine
the
poor
man
does
get
very
good
wages
and
went
quite
red
as
he
took
it
and
all
ended
happily
remarked
salt
tentatively
as
though
he
had
expected
that
a
possible
relevance
might
have
been
forthcoming
after
all
happily
but
perplexingly
replied
miss
lisle
looking
him
full
in
the
face
as
she
unmasked
the
point
of
her
long
pointless
story
for
the
surly
workman
who
was
embarrassed
by
sixpence
was
my
gentlemanly
neighbour
of
the
queen
hall
meeting
and
i
was
curious
to
know
how
he
should
be
serving
the
object
of
the
league
by
acting
as
a
to
the
lacon
equalised
superphosphate
company
salt
laughed
quietly
and
looked
back
with
unmoved
composure
no
doubt
many
possible
explanations
will
occur
to
you
he
said
with
very
plausible
candour
the
simplest
is
the
true
one
several
undertakings
either
belong
to
the
league
or
are
closely
connected
with
it
for
increasing
its
revenue
or
for
other
purposes
the
lacon
is
one
of
these
and
i
do
doubt
that
even
the
position
of
doorkeeper
is
a
responsible
one
requiring
the
intelligence
of
an
educated
gentleman
to
fill
it
retorted
miss
lisle
it
must
certainly
be
an
exacting
one
you
know
better
than
i
do
how
many
great
motor
vans
pass
down
that
quiet
little
lane
every
hour
they
bear
the
names
of
different
companies
they
are
ingeniously
different
in
appearance
and
they
pass
through
london
by
various
roads
and
but
they
have
one
unique
resemblance
they
are
all
driven
by
mechanics
who
are
astonishingly
disconcerted
by
the
offer
of
stray
sixpences
and
shillings
it
is
the
same
at
the
little
private
wharf
on
the
canal
a
mile
away
it
was
quite
a
relief
to
find
that
the
bargemen
were
common
human
bargees
salt
still
smiled
kindly
the
slow
silent
habit
gives
the
best
mask
after
all
and
why
have
you
come
to
me
he
asked
because
i
that
you
are
going
to
do
something
and
i
want
to
help
i
loathe
the
way
things
are
being
done
down
there
the
nod
meant
the
stately
palace
of
westminster
though
it
happened
to
be
really
in
the
direction
of
charing
cross
but
it
was
equally
appropriate
for
the
monuments
of
the
government
like
those
of
wren
lay
all
around
who
can
go
on
playing
tennis
as
usual
when
an
ambassador
who
learned
his
diplomacy
in
a
union
represents
us
by
acting
alternately
as
a
fool
and
a
cad
before
an
astounded
paris
or
have
an
interest
in
bridge
when
the
sultan
of
turkey
is
contemptuously
ordering
us
to
keep
our
fleet
out
of
sight
of
mitylene
and
we
apologise
and
obey
i
will
be
content
to
address
envelopes
all
day
long
if
it
will
be
of
any
use
surely
there
are
other
secret
processes
down
other
little
lanes
i
will
even
be
the
doorkeeper
at
another
artificial
manure
works
if
there
is
nothing
else
salt
sat
thinking
but
from
the
first
he
knew
that
for
good
or
ill
some
degree
of
their
confidence
must
be
extended
to
a
woman
it
is
the
common
experience
of
every
movement
when
it
swells
beyond
two
members
or
conspiracies
would
be
much
more
dangerous
to
their
foes
it
may
be
monotonous
perhaps
even
purposeless
as
far
as
you
can
see
he
warned
i
do
not
know
yet
and
it
will
not
be
for
you
to
say
miss
lisle
flushed
with
the
pleasurable
thrill
of
blind
sacrifice
i
will
not
question
she
replied
only
if
there
should
be
any
need
you
might
find
that
an
ordinary
uninteresting
girl
with
a
slangy
style
and
a
muddy
complexion
could
be
as
devoted
as
a
flora
macdonald
or
a
charlotte
corday
salt
made
a
quiet
deprecating
gesture
a
girl
with
a
fearless
truthful
face
can
be
capable
of
any
heroism
he
remarked
as
he
began
to
write
especially
when
she
combines
exceptional
intelligence
with
exceptional
discretion
only
he
added
as
an
afterthought
it
may
be
and
might
be
inconvenient
in
a
constitutional
age
i
quite
understand
that
now
the
conscientious
addressing
of
circulars
shall
bound
my
horizon
only
please
let
me
be
somewhere
in
it
when
it
come
i
say
salt
drawled
an
immaculately
garbed
young
man
lounging
into
the
room
do
you
happen
miss
lisle
who
had
been
cut
off
from
the
door
by
a
screen
rose
to
leave
oh
i
say
i
beg
your
pardon
exclaimed
the
young
man
they
told
me
that
you
were
alone
i
shall
be
disengaged
in
a
moment
replied
salt
formally
at
ten
morning
then
miss
lisle
please
she
bowed
and
withdrew
the
honourable
freddy
tantroy
who
had
lingered
rather
helplessly
holding
the
door
as
she
went
out
and
favouring
her
with
a
criticising
glance
always
making
rotten
ass
of
myself
murmured
that
gentleman
plaintively
general
office
fault
engaging
lady
clerk
not
bad
idea
but
you
might
have
gone
in
for
really
superior
article
while
you
were
about
it
cheaper
in
the
end
oh
i
do
know
though
miss
lisle
came
with
the
best
of
recommendations
said
salt
almost
distantly
one
might
have
judged
that
he
had
no
desire
for
mr
society
but
that
reasons
existed
why
he
should
not
tell
him
so
yes
i
know
nodded
freddy
sagely
they
do
hockey
girl
i
should
imagine
face
of
the
pomegranate
type
carved
by
amateur
whose
hand
slipped
when
he
was
doing
the
mouth
prefer
the
pink
and
pneumatic
style
myself
matter
taste
salt
made
no
reply
the
only
possible
reply
was
the
one
he
denied
himself
he
occupied
the
time
by
burning
a
scrap
of
paper
with
a
single
row
of
figures
i
say
salt
i
was
really
coming
about
something
but
i
forgotten
what
announced
the
honourable
youth
after
a
vacuous
pause
oh
i
remember
that
elusive
old
cheesecake
of
a
hunk
of
mine
do
you
happen
to
know
where
the
volatile
sir
john
is
to
be
unearthed
i
imagine
that
your
uncle
is
in
paris
at
this
moment
replied
salt
he
is
expected
back
paris
exclaimed
freddy
with
some
interest
good
luck
at
the
pink
windmill
old
boy
anything
in
the
air
salt
projected
french
landing
at
brighton
pier
next
week
seriously
do
you
think
league
bit
of
gilded
fizzle
expected
something
with
coloured
lights
long
ago
i
think
that
we
have
every
reason
to
be
satisfied
with
the
progress
replied
salt
the
weight
of
a
great
organisation
must
exercise
some
influence
in
the
end
oh
yes
retorted
mr
tantroy
with
a
cunning
look
that
the
other
face
of
johnny
they
have
stuffed
in
museums
well
all
in
good
time
little
freddy
if
you
sit
quiet
he
carried
out
this
condition
literally
for
a
couple
of
minutes
gazing
pensively
at
a
slender
ring
he
wore
then
i
tell
you
what
salt
he
continued
i
wish
you
use
benign
influence
with
sir
john
tired
of
apeing
the
golden
ass
and
i
am
thinking
of
settling
down
want
an
office
here
and
absolutely
grinding
hard
work
ten
to
four
and
couple
of
thousand
a
year
or
so
until
i
worth
more
fact
is
met
girl
i
could
absolutely
exist
for
ever
with
in
gilded
been
vivarium
lately
no
replied
salt
oh
well
no
good
trying
my
rotten
powers
description
must
go
with
me
some
night
and
see
she
hangs
by
her
toes
to
a
slack
wire
feet
above
the
stage
and
sings
are
strangely
upside
down
dear
boys
nowadays
no
getting
away
from
it
she
is
positively
the
most
crystallised
damson
that
ever
stepped
out
of
box
no
fear
monotony
in
home
with
girl
like
that
the
very
thought
of
it
well
come
out
and
have
drink
salt
thanks
no
replied
salt
i
quite
got
out
of
the
habit
great
scott
exclaimed
freddy
aghast
you
better
try
some
of
those
newspaper
things
that
johnnies
with
funny
addresses
and
members
of
the
greek
royal
family
write
up
to
say
have
done
them
no
end
i
say
salt
i
suppose
there
is
spare
office
in
this
palatial
suite
that
i
could
have
if
i
grappled
with
the
gilded
effort
i
really
do
know
that
there
is
he
had
not
the
most
shadowy
faith
in
the
honourable
freddy
perseverance
even
in
intention
for
a
week
to
expect
any
real
work
from
him
was
out
of
the
question
we
are
rather
overcrowded
here
as
it
is
if
i
were
you
salt
i
should
insist
upon
the
old
man
removing
better
premises
somewhere
place
seems
absolutely
congealed
with
underlings
just
listen
to
that
in
next
room
it
like
hive
of
gilded
bees
what
is
it
simply
routine
work
going
on
said
salt
sorry
i
ca
spare
the
time
to
come
out
with
you
oh
that
all
said
freddy
taking
the
hint
and
rising
sorry
pramp
pramp
you
think
i
shall
find
sir
john
here
friday
if
i
look
in
yes
here
but
desperately
busy
er
thanks
drawled
freddy
with
just
a
suggestion
of
vice
perhaps
my
uncle
will
be
able
to
spare
me
five
minutes
when
he
has
done
with
you
he
drifted
languidly
through
the
door
and
sauntered
down
the
passage
at
the
door
of
the
room
where
the
monotonous
voice
rose
and
fell
in
the
ceaseless
repetition
of
short
sentences
he
paused
to
light
a
cigarette
for
perhaps
a
full
minute
he
remained
quite
motionless
the
cigarette
between
his
lips
the
match
pressed
ready
against

an

weeks
after

of

but
it
did
not
interest
mr
tantroy
immersed
in
a
scheme
for
taxing
baths
syphons
and
asparagus
beds
and
further
occupied
with
the
unexpectedly
delicate
details
of
withdrawing
from
india
it
did
not
interest
the
government
it
was
only
the
ordinary
routine
work
of
the
unity
league
chapter
vii
schedule
b
on
the
following
day
sir
john
hampden
returned
from
paris
a
week
later
and
he
had
again
left
london
at
the
office
of
the
league
it
was
impossible
to
learn
where
he
had
gone
perhaps
fishing
it
was
suggested
in
any
case
he
was
taking
a
holiday
and
did
not
want
to
be
troubled
with
business
so
that
nothing
was
being
forwarded
a
little
later
any
one
might
know
for
the
asking
that
he
was
in
berlin
and
returning
the
next
day
there
was
never
any
secret
made
of
sir
john
movements
if
the
office
knew
them
only
he
occasionally
liked
to
cut
himself
completely
off
from
communication
in
order
to
ensure
a
perfect
rest
as
soon
as
the
office
knew
where
he
was
every
one
else
could
know
too
only
it
invariably
happened
that
he
was
on
his
way
back
by
that
time
the
incident
was
repeated
callers
at
trafalgar
chambers
found
all
the
heads
communicative
and
very
leisured
it
came
out
that
nothing
much
was
being
done
just
then
it
was
not
the
time
of
the
year
for
politics
for
all
the
good
they
were
doing
of
the
offices
might
be
closed
for
the
next
few
months
and
of
the
staff
take
a
holiday
in
fact
that
was
what
they
were
doing
to
a
large
extent
it
was
mr
salt
turn
as
soon
as
sir
john
got
back
that
time
it
was
petersburg
for
a
man
who
had
been
a
sailor
george
salt
displayed
a
curious
taste
when
he
came
to
take
his
holiday
the
sea
had
no
call
for
him
nor
the
any
charm
the
inland
resorts
the
golf
centres
moors
lakes
mountains
and
rivers
all
were
passed
by
it
was
not
even
to
an
undiscovered
village
or
some
secluded
country
house
that
he
turned
his
footsteps
in
hope
of
perfect
change
on
the
contrary
where
the
ceaseless
din
of
industry
made
rest
impossible
where
the
puny
but
irresistible
hands
of
generations
of
mankind
had
scarred
the
face
of
earth
like
a
corroding
growth
where
the
sky
was
shut
out
by
smoke
vegetation
stifled
beneath
a
cloak
of
grime
day
and
night
turned
into
one
lurid
vulcanian
twilight
in
which
by
bands
and
companies
by
trains
and
outposts
dwarfish
men
toiled
in
the
unlovely
rhythm
of
hopeless
endless
labour
the
of
nature
there
salt
spent
his
holiday
coal
was
the
loadstone
that
drew
him
on
and
in
a
vast
contour
his
journey
through
that
month
defined
the
limits
of
the
of
the
land
in
the
subsequent
histories
of
this
period
no
mention
of
significant
appearance
in
the
provinces
finds
a
place
yet
in
presenting
a
dispassionate
review
of
the
succeeding
events
it
is
impossible
to
ignore
its
influence
although
to
adopt
a
just
proportion
it
is
not
necessary
to
deal
with
it
at
length
it
was
not
a
vital
detail
of
the
scheme
on
which
the
league
had
staked
its
cause
it
was
less
momentous
than
any
of
hampden
three
continental
missions
but
by
disarming
opposition
in
certain
influential
quarters
when
the
crisis
came
it
removed
a
possible
cause
of
dissension
from
the
first
that
is
its
place
it
was
an
indication
of
the
extreme
care
with
which
the
operations
had
been
developed
that
even
at
this
point
there
were
still
only
two
men
who
had
any
real
knowledge
of
what
the
plan
of
campaign
would
be
there
were
those
who
did
not
hesitate
to
declare
that
a
hostile
demonstration
was
being
arranged
by
a
foreign
power
with
whom
hampden
had
come
to
an
understanding
at
a
favourable
moment
a
pretext
for
a
quarrel
would
be
found
relations
would
be
broken
off
immediately
ambassadors
recalled
and
within
three
days
england
would
be
threatened
with
war
if
necessary
an
actual
invasion
would
take
place
and
in
view
of
the
sweeping
reductions
in
the
army
and
navy
no
one
thought
it
worth
while
to
express
a
doubt
that
an
actual
invasion
could
take
place
after
arranging
for
a
suitable
indemnity
the
invaders
would
withdraw
leaving
a
provisional
government
in
power
with
hampden
at
its
head
this
was
the
extremists
view
and
the
majority
feeling
at
heart
that
however
england
might
be
internally
riven
and
their
liberties
assailed
nothing
could
ever
justify
so
unpatriotic
a
course
held
that
hampden
was
incapable
of
the
step
others
suggested
civil
war
passive
resistance
to
the
payment
of
rates
and
taxes
on
so
organised
a
scale
as
to
embarrass
the
government
for
supplies
an
alliance
on
a
basis
not
readily
discernible
with
the
rank
and
file
of
the
socialist
party
the
secret
importation
of
a
sufficient
number
of
aliens
to
turn
an
election
and
a
variety
of
other
ingenious
devices
easy
to
suggest
but
difficult
to
maintain
those
who
like
miss
lisle
observed
the
most
talked
the
least
among
the
working
men
of
the
country
the
class
that
the
league
had
come
into
being
to
control
it
had
passed
into
the
category
of
a
second
buttercup
league
and
was
ignored
a
few
better
informed
accepted
the
conclusions
that
mr
hammet
and
his
associates
had
arrived
at
and
laughed
quietly
in
their
sleeves
at
the
thought
of
the
coming
humiliation
of
the
confiding
members
last
of
all
there
remained
a
scattered
few
here
and
there
who
through
natural
suspicion
or
a
shrewder
wisdom
than
their
fellows
had
of
late
begun
to
detect
in
the
existence
of
the
league
a
real
menace
to
themselves
and
to
urge
the
powers
and
mr
tubes
in
particular
to
counteract
its
aims
it
might
have
been
a
race
a
desperate
race
but
for
one
simple
thing
hampden
had
asked
for
three
years
in
which
to
complete
his
plans
and
both
friends
and
foes
deducing
from
every
experience
of
the
past
ranging
from
the
opening
of
an
exhibition
to
the
closing
of
a
war
had
conceded
that
this
meant
four
at
least
but
hampden
and
the
man
who
had
been
a
sailor
had
no
intention
of
being
embarrassed
by
a
race
not
three
years
meaning
four
but
three
years
meaning
two
had
underlain
the
boast
and
at
the
end
of
two
years
although
there
was
still
much
to
be
gained
by
time
and
an
unfettered
choice
of
the
moment
of
attack
there
was
no
probability
of
being
forestalled
on
any
important
point
such
was
the
position
when
salt
set
out
on
his
provincial
holiday
he
had
nothing
to
learn
elementary
detail
of
that
kind
belonged
to
another
journey
when
more
than
two
years
ago
he
had
made
the
tour
he
did
not
go
to
offer
peace
or
war
that
die
had
been
cast
blindly
who
shall
say
how
many
years
before
in
northampton
boot
factories
lancashire
mills
durham
in
radical
clubs
and
labour
cabinets
but
in
war
and
in
civil
war
most
of
all
every
blow
aimed
at
the
foe
must
spend
its
expiring
force
upon
a
friend
and
therefore
salt
went
to
the
at
each
centre
he
was
met
by
a
high
official
of
the
league
who
had
local
knowledge
the
man
made
his
report
it
concerned
a
list
he
brought
a
list
of
names
sometimes
it
contained
only
three
or
four
names
sometimes
as
many
dozens
if
to
each
name
there
stood
the
word
content
salt
passed
on
to
his
next
centre
if
some
were
reported
to
be
holding
out
or
dissatisfied
salt
remained
when
he
resumed
his
methodical
way
the
word
content
had
been
added
to
every
name
only
once
did
failure
threaten
to
mar
his
record
a
lancashire
colliery
proprietor
a
man
who
had
risen
from
the
lowest
grade
of
labour
as
men
more
often
did
in
the
hard
healthy
days
of
emulous
rivalry
than
in
the
later
piping
times
of
collective
indolence
did
not
wish
to
listen
positive
narrow
he
was
permeated
with
the
dogmatic
egotism
of
his
successful
life
he
had
never
asked
another
man
advice
he
had
never
made
a
mistake
as
hard
as
the
ground
out
of
which
he
had
carved
his
fortune
he
hated
and
despised
his
men
they
knew
it
and
hated
and
respected
him
in
return
his
own
brother
worked
as
a
miner
in
his
deep
and
received
a
miner
wage
he
hated
his
master
with
the
rest
lomas
was
the
closest
employer
in
the
north
central
and
the
richest
but
there
were
fewer
widows
and
orphans
in
halghcroft
than
in
any
other
pit
village
of
its
size
and
lomas
spent
nothing
in
insurance
under
his
immediate
eye
cage
cables
did
not
snap
tram
shackles
part
nor
did
unexpected
falls
of
shoring
occur
his
men
did
not
smoke
at
their
work
and
no
mysterious
explosion
had
ever
engaged
the
attention
of
a
board
of
trade
enquiry
salt
found
him
sitting
in
his
shirt
sleeves
in
a
noble
room
furnished
in
the
taste
and
profusion
of
a
crowded
pantechnicon
with
the
most
costly
specimens
of
seventeen
periods
of
decorative
art
he
received
him
with
his
usual
manner
and
that
was
the
manner
of
a
bellicose
curmudgeon
towards
an
unwelcome
deputation
of
suppliants
for
emphasis
between
the
frank
didactic
aphorisms
which
formed
his
arguments
and
his
rules
of
life
he
banged
with
his
fist
a
table
and
lowered
his
voice
in
a
confidential
aside
to
inform
his
visitor
that
three
thousand
pounds
was
the
figure
that
the
little
piece
of
furniture
had
cost
him
and
that
in
matters
of
taste
he
stuck
at
nothing
an
unnecessary
piece
of
information
after
one
had
cast
an
astonished
glance
around
that
bizarre
room
in
lomas
future
there
loomed
a
knighthood
the
consummation
in
his
mind
of
all
earthly
ambition
and
the
possible
fruit
of
a
lavish
charity
of
the
kind
that
is
scarcely
the
greatest
of
the
three
and
his
policy
was
wholly
dictated
by
a
fear
of
endangering
his
chances
he
would
have
resented
the
suggestion
in
the
face
of
several
munificent
donations
that
he
had
recently
made
to
certain
funds
and
a
gracious
acknowledgment
which
he
had
received
that
the
king
was
not
following
his
career
with
a
personal
interest
what
then
was
the
king
attitude
towards
the
unity
league
and
its
plan
of
campaign
had
salt
anything
to
show
it
was
useless
to
protest
the
inviolability
of
royal
neutrality
lomas
only
banged
the
that
was
good
enough
for
outsiders
he
retorted
now
between
themselves
the
strong
man
who
was
restrained
by
diplomatic
conventions
could
make
no
headway
with
the
strong
man
who
was
frankly
primitive
in
his
selfishness
and
salt
withdrew
baffled
but
unperturbed
but
the
sequel
was
that
before
he
left
his
hotel
the
following
day
lomas
had
waited
upon
him
with
full
acquiescence
to
the
terms
and
the
central
was
content
the
inference
might
be
that
at
last
the
intentions
of
the
league
must
have
been
disclosed
the
reality
was
nothing
of
the
kind
what
had
been
revealed
to
these
men
then
the
largest
employers
of
labour
of
any
class
throughout
the
country
to
which
they
had
signified
their
consent
it
may
be
asked
and
the
truth
was
that
nothing
had
been
revealed
that
even
the
officers
of
the
league
who
sounded
them
were
in
the
dark
in
the
past
industrial
struggles
had
always
been
between
capital
and
labour
that
vaster
encounter
upon
which
the
league
was
now
concentrating
its
energies
was
not
to
be
on
such
clearly
defined
lines
and
in
the
strife
capital
might
suffer
side
by
side
with
labour
against
that
contingency
the
coal
influence
had
now
been
indemnified
in
the
name
of
the
unity
league
and
the
future
government
and
the
guarantee
had
been
accepted
it
was
a
precaution
in
the
end
it
narrowed
the
issue
and
it
secured
more
than
neutrality
in
a
quarter
where
open
hostility
might
have
otherwise
been
proclaimed
it
just
tended
to
realise
that
perfection
of
detail
and
completeness
of
preparation
that
mark
the
successful
campaign
but
if
there
was
nothing
more
to
learn
in
the
sense
that
the
data
upon
which
the
league
had
based
its
plans
had
long
since
been
complete
it
was
impossible
for
a
thoughtful
observer
to
pass
through
the
land
without
learning
much
even
two
years
of
increasing
privilege
had
left
a
deeper
mark
a
lavish
policy
of
bread
and
circuses
was
again
depleting
the
countryside
choking
the
towns
and
destroying
the
instinct
of
citizenship
just
as
it
had
speeded
the
decline
of
another
two
thousand
years
before
while
wages
had
remained
practically
stationary
the
leisure
of
the
working
man
had
been
appreciably
increased
and
it
was
now
being
discovered
that
the
working
man
had
no
way
of
passing
his
leisure
except
in
spending
money
betting
and
drunkenness
had
increased
in
direct
ratio
to
the
lengthened
hours
of
enforced
idleness
and
other
disquieting
indications
of
how
the
time
was
being
spent
were
brought
home
to
those
who
moved
among
the
poor
where
the
money
came
from
the
books
of
the
great
thrift
societies
at
once
revealed
there
was
no
longer
any
necessity
for
the
working
man
to
save
his
wages
were
guaranteed
his
risks
of
sickness
and
every
other
adversity
were
insured
against
his
old
age
was
pensioned
his
children
were
if
necessary
even
the
trades
unions
had
abolished
their
subscriptions
and
dissipated
their
reserves
there
was
no
need
of
thrift
now
for
the
government
was
the
working
man
savings
bank
and
had
cut
out
the
debit
pages
of
his
it
was
almost
the
millennium
the
only
drawback
was
that
with
all
this
affluence
around
the
working
man
found
himself
very
much
in
the
condition
of
a
financial
ancient
mariner
there
was
a
great
deal
of
money
being
spent
on
him
and
for
him
and
by
him
but
he
never
had
any
in
his
pocket
and
the
working
man
wife
was
even
worse
off
other
classes
there
were
which
found
themselves
in
the
same
position
but
not
by
the
same
process
the
rich
were
taxed
up
to
the
eyes
but
the
rich
had
obvious
means
of
retrenchment
but
the
great
mass
of
the
middle
class
had
no
elastic
extravagances
upon
which
they
could
economise
even
under
favourable
conditions
they
were
for
the
most
part
fulfilling
disraeli
pessimistic
dictum
to
the
generality
manhood
had
been
a
struggle
it
had
passed
into
a
failure
it
stood
face
to
face
with
the
certainty
of
becoming
a
disaster
inevitably
there
were
tragedies
so
it
happened
that
the
one
vivid
haunting
picture
that
george
salt
carried
down
into
later
years
from
this
period
was
not
a
lurid
impression
of
some
blackened
scene
of
dantesque
desolation
not
even
a
memory
of
any
of
the
incidents
of
his
own
personal
triumph
but
the
sharp
details
of
an
episode
that
lay
quite
off
the
of
his
work
he
was
walking
along
a
pretty
country
lane
one
evening
for
it
is
a
characteristic
of
many
of
these
unhappy
regions
that
almost
to
the
edge
of
man
squalid
usurpation
nature
spreads
her
most
gracious
charms
when
a
sudden
thunderstorm
drove
him
to
seek
the
hospitality
of
a
labourer
cottage
the
man
who
opened
the
door
was
not
a
labourer
although
he
was
shabbily
dressed
he
looked
sombrely
at
his
visitor
what
is
it
he
asked
standing
in
the
doorway
with
no
sign
of
invitation
it
is
raining
very
heavily
replied
salt
i
should
like
to
shelter
if
you
will
permit
me
the
man
seemed
to
notice
the
downpour
which
had
now
become
a
continuous
stream
for
the
first
time
i
very
busy
he
said
churlishly
if
i
might
stand
just
inside
your
doorway
suggested
salt
no
come
in
said
the
host
with
an
air
of
sudden
resolution
after
all
he
led
the
way
out
of
the
tiny
into
a
room
salt
could
not
refrain
from
noticing
that
although
the
furniture
was
meagre
the
walls
were
covered
with
paintings
i
am
an
artist
said
the
brusque
tenant
of
the
cottage
noticing
the
involuntary
glance
around
come
in
return
for
shelter
you
shall
tell
me
what
you
think
of
these
things
i
am
not
a
critic
replied
salt
stepping
from
picture
to
picture
and
it
would
be
presumptuous
therefore
for
me
to
give
an
opinion
on
works
that
i
do
not
understand
although
i
can
recognise
them
as
striking
and
unconventional
ah
commented
the
artist
and
that
he
indicated
a
portrait
with
a
nod
it
was
in
an
earlier
a
smoother
and
less
characteristic
style
to
the
man
who
was
no
artist
it
was
a
very
beautiful
painting
of
a
very
beautiful
girl
my
dead
wife
said
the
artist
as
salt
stood
in
silent
admiration
i
have
buried
her
this
afternoon
the
man
who
had
never
known
or
even
seen
her
felt
a
stab
as
he
looked
up
at
the
lovely
smiling
face
well
said
the
painter
roughly
why
do
you
say
how
sorry
you
are
or
some
platitude
of
that
sort
salt
turned
away
to
leave
the
other
alone
meeting
the
sweet
eyes
because
i
can
not
say
how
sorry
i
am
he
replied
with
gentle
pity
oh
my
beloved
he
heard
the
whisper
not
long
not
long
you
are
packing
salt
continued
a
minute
later
let
me
help
you
with
some
a
heap
of
straw
and
shavings
littered
the
floor
boxes
and
cases
stood
ready
at
hand
no
replied
the
man
looking
moodily
at
his
preparations
i
have
changed
my
mind
i
have
to
go
on
a
journey
but
i
shall
leave
this
place
as
it
is
and
secure
the
doors
and
windows
instead
he
brought
tools
and
together
they
nailed
across
the
cottage
windows
the
stout
shutters
that
secured
them
neither
spoke
much
come
said
the
artist
when
the
melancholy
work
was
complete
the
storm
is
over
our
roads
lie
together
for
a
little
way
he
locked
the
outer
door
and
stood
lingering
reluctantly
with
his
hand
upon
the
key
a
moment
he
said
unlocking
the
door
again
and
entering
only
a
moment
wait
for
me
at
the
gate
salt
waited
as
he
was
directed
beside
a
dripping
linden
the
storm
had
indeed
passed
over
but
the
sky
was
low
and
grey
little
rivulets
meandered
in
changing
currents
down
the
garden
path
from
beneath
the
narrow
lane
came
the
continuous
sobbing
rush
of
some
unseen
swollen
the
hand
of
despair
lay
heavy
across
the
scene
it
seemed
as
though
nature
had
wept
herself
out
but
was
uncomforted
salt
pictured
the
lonely
man
standing
before
the
soulless
smiling
creation
of
his
own
hand
the
door
opened
the
lock
again
creaked
mournfully
as
its
rusty
bolt
was
driven
home
and
without
a
backward
glance
the
artist
came
slowly
down
the
walk
twisting
the
clumsy
key
aimlessly
upon
his
finger
he
stopped
at
a
tangled
patch
where
the
anemone
struggled
vainly
among
the
choking
bindweed
and
the
hyacinths
and
lupines
had
been
beaten
down
to
earth
her
garden
he
said
aloud
and
a
spasm
crossed
his
face
but
now
how
overgrown
on
a
thought
he
dropped
the
key
gently
among
the
luxuriant
growth
and
turned
away
i
will
tell
you
why
my
wife
died
said
the
artist
suddenly
after
they
had
passed
round
a
bend
of
the
road
that
hid
the
cottage
from
their
sight
it
should
point
a
moral
and
it
will
not
take
long
it
may
plead
a
cause
replied
salt
ah
exclaimed
his
companion
looking
at
him
sharply
who
are
you
then
you
do
not
know
me
but
you
may
know
my
business
i
am
salt
of
the
unity
league
strange
murmured
the
other
well
then
mr
salt
my
name
is
leslie
garnet
and
as
i
have
told
you
i
am
an
artist
ten
years
ago
at
the
age
of
thirty
i
came
into
a
small
legacy
three
hundred
pounds
a
year
to
be
precise
up
to
that
time
i
had
been
making
a
somewhat
precarious
living
by
illustration
on
the
strength
of
my
fortune
which
of
course
to
a
successful
man
in
any
walk
of
life
would
be
the
merest
pittance
i
rearranged
my
plans
black
and
white
work
was
drudgery
to
me
and
it
would
never
be
anything
else
because
it
was
not
my
medium
but
it
was
the
only
form
of
pictorial
art
that
earned
a
livelihood
pictures
had
ceased
to
sell
at
the
same
time
i
had
encouragement
for
thinking
that
i
could
do
something
worthy
of
existence
in
the
higher
branch
of
art
i
do
want
to
trouble
you
with
views
i
made
my
choice
i
determined
to
live
frugally
on
my
income
give
up
hack
work
to
the
incidental
advantage
of
some
other
poor
struggler
and
devote
myself
wholly
to
pictures
which
might
possibly
bring
me
some
recognition
at
the
end
of
a
lifetime
more
probably
not
but
pictures
which
would
certainly
never
enrich
me
i
do
not
think
that
the
choice
was
an
ignoble
one
but
of
course
it
was
purely
a
personal
matter
it
was
very
soon
afterwards
that
i
got
married
had
i
thought
of
that
step
earlier
i
might
have
acted
differently
as
it
was
hilda
would
not
hear
of
it
there
seemed
no
need
we
were
very
comfortable
on
our
small
income
in
a
tiny
way
nine
years
ago
that
you
know
the
course
of
events
my
income
was
derived
from
a
prudently
invested
capital
so
disposed
as
to
give
the
highest
safe
return
not
many
years
had
passed
before
the
government
then
in
power
fixed
seven
per
cent
as
the
highest
rate
of
interest
compatible
with
commercial
morality
and
confiscated
all
above
my
fixed
system
of
living
was
embarrassed
by
a
deduction
of
fifty
pounds
a
year
the
next
year
an
chancellor
in
need
of
a
few
millions
to
spend
on
free
amusements
for
the
working
class
was
converted
to
the
principle
that
two
per
cent
of
immorality
still
remained
so
five
was
made
the
maximum
and
my
small
income
was
thus
permanently
reduced
to
two
hundred
pounds
we
received
this
second
blow
rather
blankly
but
hilda
would
not
hear
of
surrender
as
a
matter
of
fact
i
soon
found
out
that
there
was
practically
no
chance
of
it
and
that
in
throwing
up
all
connections
when
i
did
i
had
burned
my
boats
artists
of
every
kind
were
turning
to
illustration
work
but
half
of
the
magazines
were
dead
we
gave
up
the
flat
that
had
been
made
pretty
and
with
inexpensive
taste
and
moved
into
three
dreary
rooms
you
know
what
the
next
development
would
be
perhaps
yes
the
unearned
incomes
act
and
you
will
understand
how
it
affected
me
i
was
assessed
in
the
same
class
as
the
duke
of
belgravia
and
mr
the
millionaire
as
a
gentleman
of
private
income
capable
of
earning
a
living
but
electing
to
live
in
idleness
on
invested
capital
not
of
my
own
creating
i
was
married
could
not
plead
in
any
form
strong
and
healthy
and
in
the
prime
of
life
so
i
came
under
b
and
must
pay
a
tax
of
ten
shillings
and
sixpence
in
the
pound
it
was
nothing
that
i
might
actually
work
twelve
hours
every
day
officially
i
must
be
living
in
voluptuous
idleness
because
the
work
of
my
hands
did
not
bring
me
in
an
income
bearing
any
appreciable
proportion
to
my
private
means
the
government
that
denounced
riches
in
every
form
and
had
come
in
on
the
mandate
of
the
poor
and
needy
recognised
no
other
standard
of
attainment
but
money
therefore
b
of
course
the
effect
of
that
was
overwhelming
i
could
not
afford
a
studio
i
could
not
afford
a
model
i
could
scarcely
afford
materials
my
wife
who
had
long
been
delicate
was
now
really
ill
between
anxiety
and
the
unaccustomed
daily
work
to
which
she
bound
herself
one
of
the
companies
from
which
i
derived
a
portion
of
my
income
failed
at
this
time
ruined
by
foreign
competition
and
home
restrictions
in
a
panic
i
endeavoured
to
get
work
of
any
kind
i
had
not
the
experience
necessary
for
the
lowest
rungs
of
commerce
i
was
unknown
in
art
who
would
employ
a
man
beginning
life
at
i
was
too
old
i
was
warned
that
appeal
was
useless
but
i
did
appeal
before
the
commission
it
was
useless
i
learned
that
mine
was
a
thoroughly
bad
case
from
every
official
point
of
view
with
no
redeeming
feature
that
i
was
in
fact
a
parasite
upon
the
social
system
and
i
narrowly
escaped
having
the
assessment
raised
it
was
then
that
we
left
london
and
came
to
this
cottage
my
health
was
permanently
undermined
and
change
of
air
was
necessary
even
to
prolong
her
life
her
native
county
was
recommended
that
is
why
we
chose
this
spot
when
i
reviewed
affairs
i
found
that
i
had
a
clear
fifty
pounds
a
year
and
there
a
few
miles
to
the
west
where
you
see
that
tracery
of
wheels
and
scaffolding
against
the
sun
and
there
a
few
miles
to
the
north
where
you
see
that
pall
of
smoke
upon
the
air
there
lie
hundreds
and
hundreds
of
cottages
where
gross
luxury
is
rampant
where
beneath
one
roof
family
incomes
of
ten
times
mine
are
free
from
any
tax
at
all
that
is
enough
for
you
to
fill
in
the
detail
continued
garnet
bitterly
as
he
revived
the
memory
of
the
closing
scenes
doctors
things
that
had
to
be
bought
bare
existence
what
remained
of
the
investments
sold
for
what
a
forced
sale
would
bring
you
know
what
that
means
the
end
you
have
seen
and
there
mr
salt
is
the
story
to
your
hand
here
is
the
churchyard
killed
to
make
a
labour
holiday
he
opened
the
rustic
gate
of
the
hillside
churchyard
and
led
the
way
to
a
mound
where
the
perfume
hung
stagnantly
from
the
petals
of
a
great
sheaf
of
bermuda
lilies
i
remain
here
he
said
quietly
after
a
few
minutes
silence
by
the
your
road
lies
straight
on
along
the
field
path
you
can
even
see
the
smoke
of
thornley
from
here
lying
to
your
right
salt
did
not
reply
looking
intently
in
the
opposite
direction
he
was
locating
with
a
seaman
eye
another
cloud
of
smoke
that
rose
above
the
in
the
valley
they
had
left
your
house
he
exclaimed
pointing
man
he
cried
suddenly
with
a
flash
of
intuition
what
are
you
doing
you
fired
the
straw
before
we
left
a
sharp
report
was
the
only
answer
salt
turned
too
late
to
arrest
his
arm
only
in
time
to
catch
him
as
he
fell
he
lowered
him
there
was
nothing
else
to
do
lowered
him
on
to
the
wet
sods
that
flanked
the
mound
and
knelt
by
his
side
so
that
he
might
support
him
somewhat
to
one
who
had
been
on
there
was
no
need
to
wonder
what
to
do
it
was
a
matter
not
of
minutes
but
of
seconds
the
mute
eyes
met
his
dimly
he
heard
the
single
whisper
hilda
and
then
without
a
tremor
garnet
pressed
a
little
more
heavily
against
his
arm
and
lay
across
the
yet
unfinished
grave
of
his
wife
chapter
viii
tantroy
earns
his
wage
i
think
observed
salt
reflectively
soon
after
his
return
that
you
had
better
take
a
short
holiday
now
miss
lisle
miss
lisle
looked
up
from
her
work
she
was
not
addressing
circulars
it
may
be
stated
with
an
expression
not
quite
devoid
of
suspicion
i
will
if
you
wish
me
to
do
so
sir
she
replied
meekly
but
personally
i
do
not
require
one
you
have
been
of
great
use
to
us
while
i
was
away
he
explained
kindly
but
with
official
precision
and
now
that
i
am
back
again
you
have
the
opportunity
miss
lisle
coloured
rather
rapturously
at
the
formal
praise
but
the
astute
young
woman
did
not
allow
her
exaltation
to
beguile
her
senses
a
week
holiday
she
asked
i
would
suggest
a
fortnight
he
replied
that
would
be
until
the
end
of
june
salt
agreed
then
nothing
is
likely
to
happen
before
the
end
of
june
he
laughed
frankly
there
was
no
trace
of
the
mystery
and
restraint
of
the
electric
tension
in
the
air
that
forerun
portentous
events
as
we
are
told
to
be
noticed
about
the
office
of
the
league
a
great
deal
may
happen
before
that
time
but
nothing
i
think
i
can
assure
you
that
comes
within
your
meaning
is
there
any
particular
place
that
you
would
like
me
to
go
to
oh
not
at
all
forget
trafalgar
chambers
and
business
entirely
for
the
time
possibly
miss
lisle
had
looked
for
some
hidden
meaning
behind
the
simple
suggestion
of
a
holiday
had
anticipated
another
secret
process
down
another
little
lane
at
any
rate
she
did
not
rejoice
at
the
prospect
on
the
contrary
she
declined
it
thank
you
sir
she
replied
but
unless
it
is
for
your
convenience
i
should
prefer
to
go
on
addressing
circulars
salt
frowned
slightly
and
smiled
slightly
and
inwardly
admitted
to
himself
that
he
had
probably
expected
worse
things
when
he
had
first
accepted
miss
lisle
services
i
am
a
very
plain
straightforward
person
in
all
my
dealings
he
remarked
and
you
outside
the
strict
line
of
work
here
have
an
oblique
vein
that
taxes
the
imagination
further
it
carries
the
sting
that
with
all
you
generally
arrive
at
the
same
conclusion
as
i
do
only
a
little
earlier
i
have
a
loathsome
repulsive
nature
i
know
admitted
irene
cheerfully
trivial
suspicious
i
require
strict
discipline
that
is
why
i
am
better
here
so
far
i
have
not
been
inconvenienced
by
the
two
first
characteristics
it
is
a
mistake
perhaps
to
be
yes
agreed
the
lady
with
a
level
glance
it
only
ends
in
you
finding
people
out
when
otherwise
you
might
have
gone
on
believing
in
them
to
the
last
salt
had
only
known
miss
lisle
for
a
few
months
and
for
a
third
of
the
period
he
had
not
seen
her
but
he
knew
that
when
she
showed
a
disposition
to
take
up
his
time
something
more
than
the
amenities
of
conversation
lay
behind
her
words
he
remembered
that
level
glance
it
foreshadowed
another
long
pointless
tale
for
instance
he
suggested
encouragingly
if
i
left
this
office
locked
when
i
went
out
to
lunch
for
instance
and
found
it
still
locked
but
the
papers
slightly
disarranged
on
my
return
she
replied
anything
more
it
is
very
unpleasant
to
set
traps
of
course
but
if
i
put
a
little
dab
of
typewriter
ink
on
the
inner
handle
of
the
door
when
i
next
went
out
and
subsequently
found
a
slight
stain
of
a
similar
colour
on
my
white
glove
after
shaking
hands
with
some
one
the
suspicion
would
be
deepened
i
think
that
the
matter
is
of
sufficient
importance
for
you
to
tell
me
all
you
know
he
said
gravely
if
you
hesitate
to
be
definite
for
fear
of
making
a
mistake
i
will
take
pains
to
verify
your
suspicions
and
i
will
accept
all
responsibility
then
i
accuse
mr
tantroy
of
being
a
paid
spy
in
the
service
of
the
government
tantroy
exclaimed
salt
with
a
momentary
feeling
of
incredulity
tantroy
it
seems
impossible
but
after
all
it
is
possible
enough
you
know
of
course
that
he
has
a
room
here
now
and
might
even
think
in
his
inexperience
that
he
was
at
liberty
to
come
into
this
office
at
any
time
but
not
to
take
impressions
of
my
keys
and
have
duplicates
made
nor
to
copy
extracts
in
my
absence
nor
to
open
and
examine
the
cipher
typewriter
has
that
been
left
unlocked
he
demanded
sharply
no
she
replied
you
have
the
only
key
that
i
know
of
but
it
been
unlocked
and
i
infer
that
the
code
has
been
copied
for
quite
three
minutes
there
was
silence
salt
was
thinking
not
idly
but
estimating
exactly
the
effect
of
what
had
happened
miss
lisle
was
waiting
with
somewhat
rare
perception
until
he
was
ready
to
continue
sooner
or
later
something
of
the
sort
was
bound
to
come
he
summed
up
quietly
without
a
trace
of
discomfiture
it
is
only
the
personality
that
is
surprising
his
interests
are
identical
with
ours
he
has
everything
to
gain
by
our
success
why
why
on
earth
i
think
that
i
can
explain
that
in
three
words
suggested
miss
lisle
velma
st
saint
salt
looked
enquiringly
he
had
forgotten
the
hon
freddy
deity
for
the
moment
of
the
vivarium
added
irene
oh
the
lady
who
hangs
by
her
toes
he
remarked
with
enlightenment
world
greatest
inverted
cantatrice
quoted
miss
lisle
that
is
her
celebrated
down
song
that
the
organ
is
playing
in
the
street
below
a
few
years
ago
she
got
a
week
engagement
at
the
elysium
at
a
salary
of
eighty
pounds
she
calculated
from
that
that
she
could
afford
to
spend
four
thousand
a
year
and
although
all
theatrical
incomes
have
steadily
declined
ever
since
until
she
only
gets
ten
pounds
a
week
now
she
has
never
been
able
to
make
any
difference
in
her
style
of
living
of
course
there
is
a
deficit
to
be
made
up
it
is
just
as
well
if
it
had
not
been
tantroy
it
would
have
been
some
one
abler
now
what
has
he
done
what
has
he
learned
duplicate
keys
of
this
door
and
of
my
desk
have
been
made
the
lock
of
the
cipher
typewriter
case
is
not
of
an
elaborate
pattern
and
any
one
bringing
a
quantity
of
keys
of
the
right
size
would
probably
find
one
to
answer
i
do
think
that
either
your
desk
or
the
safe
has
been
opened
certainly
not
since
i
began
to
notice
the
papers
to
which
he
would
have
access
are
consequently
not
highly
important
letters
suggested
salt
for
instance
my
letters
lying
here
until
you
forwarded
them
there
is
a
post
in
at
eight
in
the
morning
others
after
you
have
left
up
to
ten
at
night
there
would
be
every
opportunity
for
abstracting
some
opening
them
at
leisure
and
then
dropping
them
into
the
again
a
little
later
no
said
miss
lisle
i
took
precautions
against
that
how
he
demanded
and
waited
very
keenly
for
her
answer
simply
by
arriving
here
before
eight
and
remaining
until
ten
thank
you
it
was
all
he
said
but
it
did
not
leave
miss
lisle
with
the
empty
feeling
that
virtue
had
merely
been
its
own
reward
perhaps
i
ought
to
add
that
mr
tantroy
tried
to
get
information
from
me
she
remarked
distantly
he
he
came
here
frequently
and
wished
me
to
accept
presents
boxes
of
chocolate
at
first
i
think
and
jewellery
afterwards
it
was
a
mistake
he
made
yes
assented
salt
thoughtfully
i
think
it
was
there
is
one
other
thing
miss
lisle
you
could
scarcely
know
with
whom
he
was
negotiating
on
the
other
side
no
she
admitted
regretfully
i
had
not
sufficient
time
that
was
why
i
did
not
wish
to
go
away
just
now
i
do
not
think
that
you
need
hesitate
to
leave
it
now
i
am
not
taking
it
out
of
your
hands
only
carrying
on
another
phase
that
you
have
made
possible
it
will
simplify
matters
if
i
have
the
office
to
myself
could
you
find
an
opportunity
for
telling
tantroy
casually
that
you
are
taking
a
fortnight
holiday
her
answer
hung
just
a
moment
had
he
known
tantroy
better
he
might
have
guessed
yes
certainly
she
replied
hastily
with
a
little
stumble
in
her
speech
perhaps
he
guessed
no
he
corrected
himself
on
second
thoughts
it
does
not
matter
i
do
not
mind
she
protested
loyally
if
it
were
necessary
i
should
not
hesitate
to
ask
you
he
replied
half
brusquely
it
is
not
very
well
i
will
go
that
evening
when
he
was
alone
salt
unlocked
the
typewriter
case
to
which
miss
lisle
had
alluded
took
out
the
machine
and
seating
himself
before
it
proceeded
to
compose
a
letter
upon
which
he
seemed
to
spend
much
consideration
as
his
fingers
struck
the
keys
upon
the
sheet
of
paper
in
the
carrier
there
appeared
the
following
mystifying
composition
kbeljsl
wopmjvsjxkivslilscalkwespljkjscwecsspssp
fxfejsloxmjcneoeqjdncs
it
was
in
fact
as
miss
lisle
had
said
a
code
typewriter
the
letters
which
appeared
on
the
paper
did
not
correspond
with
the
letters
on
the
keys
according
to
the
keyboard
the
writing
should
have
been
mydrstr
nwhvsltscmpltrprtbfrmndthrsmstbndbtthtth
prpslhvfrmltdsfsblndth
and
signified
to
resolve
it
into
its
ultimate
form
my
dear
estair
i
now
have
salt
complete
report
before
me
and
there
seems
to
be
no
doubt
that
the
proposal
i
have
formulated
is
feasible
and
the
written
without
vowels
stops
capitals
or
spaces
this
gave
a
very
serviceable
cryptograph
but
there
was
an
added
safeguard
after
completing
the
first
line
the
writer
moved
a
and
brought
another
set
of
symbols
into
play
or
rather
the
same
symbols
under
a
different
arrangement
the
process
was
repeated
for
the
third
line
and
then
the
fourth
line
returned
to
the
system
of
the
first
thus
three
codes
were
really
in
operation
and
the
danger
of
the
key
being
found
by
the
frequent
recurrence
of
certain
symbols
the
most
fruitful
cause
of
detection
was
almost
overcome
six
identical
machines
were
in
existence
one
has
been
accounted
for
sir
john
hampden
had
another
and
a
third
was
in
the
possession
of
robert
estair
the
venerable
titular
head
of
the
combined
imperial
party
a
sociable
young
publican
who
had
a
very
snug
house
in
the
neighbourhood
of
westminster
abbey
could
have
put
his
hand
upon
the
fourth
the
fifth
was
in
the
office
of
a
company
carrying
on
an
unostentatious
business
down
a
quiet
little
lane
about
ten
or
a
dozen
miles
out
of
london
and
the
sixth
had
fallen
to
the
lot
of
a
busy
journalist
who
seemed
to
have
the
happy
knack
of
getting
political
articles
and
paragraphs
accepted
without
demur
by
all
the
leading
newspapers
by
the
simple
expedient
of
scribbling
urgent
and
some
one
else
initials
across
the
envelopes
he
sent
them
in
communications
of
the
highest
importance
never
reached
the
stage
of
ink
and
paper
but
the
six
machines
were
in
frequent
use
in
communications
the
customary
phraseology
with
which
letters
begin
and
end
was
not
used
it
is
perhaps
unnecessary
to
say
so
obvious
a
clue
as
the
short
line
kbeljsl
at
the
head
of
a
letter
addressed
to
estair
would
be
as
fatal
to
the
secrecy
of
any
code
as
the
cartouched
cleopatra
and
ptolemy
were
to
the
mystery
of
egyptian
hieroglyphics
that
salt
wrote
it
may
be
taken
as
an
indication
that
he
had
another
end
in
view
and
it
is
sometimes
a
mistake
to
overrate
the
intelligence
of
your
opponents
when
the
letter
was
finished
he
put
it
away
in
his
arranged
the
fastenings
of
both
safe
and
desk
so
that
he
could
tell
if
they
had
been
disturbed
and
then
went
home
the
next
morning
his
preparations
advanced
another
step
he
brought
with
him
a
new
letter
a
silver
with
a
plain
polished
surface
and
a
small
jar
of
some
oily
preparation
with
a
little
of
the
substance
from
the
jar
he
smeared
the
all
over
wiped
away
the
greater
part
again
until
nothing
but
an
almost
imperceptible
trace
remained
and
then
placed
it
carefully
within
his
desk
the
next
detail
was
to
write
a
dozen
letters
with
dates
extending
over
the
last
few
days
all
were
short
all
were
quite
unimportant
they
were
chiefly
concerned
with
appointments
references
to
future
league
meetings
and
the
like
some
few
were
written
in
cipher
but
the
majority
were
plain
reading
and
salt
signed
them
all
in
sir
name
appending
his
own
initials
to
sign
the
long
letter
which
he
had
already
written
he
cut
off
from
a
note
in
the
baronet
own
handwriting
the
signature
john
hampden
fastened
it
lightly
at
the
foot
of
the
typewritten
sheet
and
then
proceeded
to
copy
all
the
letters
into
the
new
book
the
effect
was
patent
one
letter
and
one
alone
stood
out
among
the
rest
as
of
importance
the
completion
was
reached
by
gumming
upon
the
back
of
the
book
a
label
inscribed
hampden
private
treating
the
leather
binding
with
a
coating
of
the
preparation
from
the
jar
and
finally
substituting
it
in
the
safe
in
place
of
the
genuine
volume
then
he
burned
his
originals
of
all
the
fictitious
letters
and
turned
to
other
matters
it
was
not
until
two
days
later
that
mr
tantroy
paid
salt
a
passing
visit
he
dropped
in
in
a
friendly
way
with
the
plea
that
the
burden
of
his
own
society
in
his
own
room
where
he
apparently
spent
two
hours
daily
in
thinking
deeply
had
grown
intolerable
you
are
always
such
a
jolly
busy
energetic
chap
salt
that
it
quite
bucks
me
up
to
watch
you
he
explained
salt
however
was
not
busy
that
afternoon
he
only
excused
himself
to
ring
for
a
note
which
was
lying
before
him
already
addressed
to
be
taken
out
and
then
gave
his
visitor
an
undivided
attention
he
was
positively
entertaining
over
his
recent
journeyings
freddy
tantroy
had
never
thought
that
the
chap
had
so
much
in
him
before
jolly
quaint
set
of
beggars
you
must
have
had
to
do
with
he
remarked
thought
that
you
were
having
gilded
flutter
monte
carlo
or
margate
or
some
of
those
places
where
crowds
people
go
salt
looked
across
at
him
with
a
smile
i
think
that
there
was
an
impression
of
that
sort
given
out
he
replied
but
between
ourselves
it
was
strictly
on
a
matter
of
business
we
league
johnnies
do
get
most
frightfully
rushed
said
freddy
sympathetically
bring
it
off
better
than
i
had
expected
i
do
think
it
will
be
long
before
we
begin
to
move
now
you
would
be
surprised
if
i
could
tell
you
of
the
unexpected
form
it
will
take
do
see
why
you
should
dropped
tantroy
negligently
salt
allowed
the
moment
to
pass
on
a
note
of
indecision
perhaps
i
am
speaking
prematurely
he
qualified
things
are
only
evolving
at
the
moment
and
i
do
suppose
that
there
will
be
anything
at
all
doing
during
the
next
few
weeks
i
have
even
sent
miss
lisle
off
on
a
holiday
noticed
the
fair
irene
empty
chair
said
freddy
for
long
i
told
her
to
take
a
fortnight
she
can
have
longer
if
she
wants
wish
sir
john
could
spare
me
but
simply
wo
hear
of
it
do
fancy
you
find
girl
much
good
though
oh
she
is
painstaking
put
in
her
employer
tolerantly
no
initiative
declared
tantroy
solemnly
no
idea
of
rising
to
the
occasion
or
of
making
use
of
her
opportunities
you
noticed
that
to
freddy
imagination
it
seemed
as
though
salt
was
regarding
him
with
open
admiration
he
wagged
his
head
judicially
i
knew
you
like
me
to
keep
eye
on
things
while
you
were
away
he
said
so
i
looked
in
here
occasionally
as
i
passed
do
believe
she
had
any
idea
what
to
do
invariably
found
her
sitting
here
in
gilded
idleness
at
every
hour
of
the
day
if
i
were
you
should
sack
her
while
she
is
away
salt
thought
it
as
well
to
change
the
subject
by
the
way
he
remarked
i
came
across
what
seemed
to
me
a
rather
good
thing
in
cigarettes
at
cardiff
and
i
wanted
to
ask
your
opinion
about
them
it
a
new
leaf
bolivian
with
a
virginian
blend
not
on
the
market
yet
i
wish
you
try
one
now
there
was
nothing
freddy
tantroy
liked
better
than
being
asked
to
give
his
opinion
on
tobacco
from
the
standpoint
of
an
expert
he
took
the
case
held
out
to
him
selected
a
cigarette
with
grave
deliberation
and
leaned
back
in
his
chair
with
a
critical
air
preparing
to
deliver
judgment
salt
returned
the
case
to
its
compartment
in
the
desk
it
has
a
very
distinctive
aroma
announced
freddy
sagely
after
he
had
drawn
a
few
whiffs
held
the
cigarette
under
his
nose
waved
it
slowly
in
the
air
before
him
and
resorted
to
several
other
devices
of
connoisseurship
i
thought
so
too
agreed
salt
he
had
bought
a
suitable
packet
of
some
obscure
brand
in
a
side
street
as
he
walked
to
the
office
two
days
before
cardiff
mused
tantroy
variety
grotesque
holes
you
seem
to
have
explored
salt
oh
i
had
to
see
a
lot
of
men
all
over
the
place
i
got
a
few
packets
of
these
from
a
docker
who
had
them
from
a
south
american
merchant
in
a
roundabout
way
smuggled
of
course
all
along
his
conversation
had
touched
upon
labourers
miners
and
other
sons
of
toil
apparently
as
tantroy
noted
he
had
scarcely
associated
with
any
other
class
he
was
lying
deliberately
and
in
a
manner
calculated
to
alienate
the
sympathy
of
many
excellent
people
for
there
is
a
worthy
and
not
inconsiderable
class
with
an
ineradicable
conviction
that
although
in
a
just
cause
the
sixth
commandment
may
be
suspended
as
it
were
by
act
of
parliament
and
the
killing
of
your
enemy
become
an
active
virtue
yet
in
no
case
is
it
permissible
to
tell
him
a
falsehood
if
it
is
necessary
to
deceive
him
the
end
must
be
gained
by
leading
him
to
it
by
inference
but
salt
belonged
to
a
school
which
believed
in
doing
things
thoroughly
and
when
on
active
service
he
swept
the
sophistries
away
he
had
to
mislead
a
man
whose
very
existence
he
believed
to
be
steeped
in
treachery
and
falsehood
and
as
the
most
effectual
way
he
lied
deliberately
to
him
frantic
adventure
drawled
tantroy
did
know
league
dealt
in
people
that
kind
of
course
i
saw
all
sorts
corrected
salt
hastily
as
though
he
feared
that
he
had
indicated
too
closely
the
trend
of
his
business
only
it
happened
that
those
were
the
most
amusing
and
to
emphasise
the
fact
he
launched
into
another
anecdote
at
an
village
there
was
neither
hotel
nor
inn
his
business
was
unfinished
and
it
was
desirable
that
he
should
stay
the
night
there
at
last
he
heard
of
a
small
where
apartments
were
occasionally
let
and
making
his
way
there
he
asked
if
he
could
have
a
room
the
woman
seemed
doubtful
of
course
as
i
am
a
stranger
i
should
wish
to
pay
you
in
advance
said
salt
it
is
that
sir
replied
the
hostess
but
i
like
to
be
sure
of
making
people
comfortable
i
do
think
that
we
shall
disagree
about
that
he
urged
perhaps
not
she
admitted
but
the
last
gentleman
was
very
hard
to
please
everything
i
got
him
he
had
better
somewhere
else
till
he
was
sick
of
it
but
she
added
in
a
burst
of
confidence
look
what
a
swell
was
i
knew
that
nothing
would
satisfy
him
when
i
saw
him
come
in
a
puffed
out
with
rheumatic
tyres
and
wearing
a
pair
of
them
kid
boots
tantroy
contributed
an
appreciative
cackle
and
salt
leaning
back
in
his
chair
pressed
against
a
pile
of
books
standing
on
his
desk
so
that
they
fell
to
the
ground
with
a
crash
by
the
time
he
had
picked
them
up
again
a
telegram
was
waiting
at
his
elbow
he
took
it
opened
it
with
a
word
of
apology
and
with
a
sharp
exclamation
pulled
out
his
watch
before
tantroy
could
realise
what
was
happening
salt
had
caught
up
his
hat
and
gloves
slammed
down
his
desk
and
after
a
single
hasty
glance
round
the
room
was
standing
at
the
door
excuse
me
wo
you
he
called
back
most
important
can
just
catch
a
train
pull
my
door
to
after
you
please
and
the
next
minute
he
was
gone
left
to
himself
tantroy
first
action
was
not
an
unnatural
one
in
the
circumstance
he
picked
up
the
telegram
which
salt
had
left
in
his
wild
hurry
and
read
it
at
once
if
you
wish
to
see
vernon
was
the
imperative
message
and
it
appeared
to
have
been
handed
in
at
croydon
half
an
hour
before
he
stepped
to
the
window
and
from
behind
the
curtains
he
saw
salt
run
down
the
steps
into
the
road
call
a
hansom
from
the
rank
near
at
hand
and
disappear
in
the
direction
of
victoria
at
a
gallop
mr
tantroy
sat
down
again
and
his
eyes
ran
over
the
various
objects
in
the
room
in
quick
succession
the
code
typewriter
he
had
all
he
wanted
from
that
salt
desk
locked
of
course
the
girl
desk
locked
and
as
he
knew
not
worth
the
trouble
of
unlocking
with
his
duplicate
key
the
safe
his
heart
gave
a
bound
his
eyes
stood
wide
in
incredulous
surprise
and
he
sprang
to
his
feet
and
stealthily
crossed
the
room
to
make
sure
of
his
astounding
luck
the
safe
was
unlocked
the
door
stood
just
an
inch
or
so
ajar
and
salt
having
failed
to
notice
it
in
his
hurried
glance
was
on
his
way
to
croydon
living
in
a
pretentious
breathless
age
drawn
into
a
social
circle
beside
whose
feverish
artificiality
the
artificiality
inseparable
from
any
phase
of
civilisation
stood
comparable
to
a
sturdy
healthy
tree
badly
brought
up
neglected
petted
the
honourable
frederick
tantroy
had
grown
to
the
form
of
the
vacuous
pose
which
he
had
adopted
beneath
it
lay
his
real
character
a
moderately
honest
man
would
not
have
played
his
part
but
an
utterly
weak
one
could
not
have
played
it
it
demanded
certain
qualities
not
contemptible
there
were
risks
to
be
taken
and
he
was
prepared
to
take
them
and
in
their
presence
his
face
took
on
a
stronger
even
better
look
he
bolted
the
door
on
the
inside
picked
up
a
few
sheets
of
paper
from
the
and
without
any
sign
of
nervousness
or
haste
began
to
do
his
work
it
was
fully
three
hours
later
when
salt
returned
for
with
that
extreme
passion
for
covering
every
possible
contingency
that
marked
his
career
he
had
been
to
croydon
many
a
better
scheme
has
failed
through
the
neglect
of
a
smaller
detail
the
room
when
he
entered
it
and
secured
the
door
looked
exactly
as
when
he
left
three
hours
before
for
all
the
disarrangement
he
had
caused
tantroy

of

at
the

nearest
to
the

a
packet
of
octavo
scribbling
paper
he
took
out
the
sheets
and
twice
counted
them
and
he
had
left
his
face
betrayed
no
emotion
satisfaction
at
having
outwitted
a
spy
was
merged
in
regret
that
there
must
need
be
one
and
pain
on
hampden
account
that
his
nephew
should
be
the
traitor
he
unlocked
his
desk
and
carefully
lifted
out
the
pulled
open
the
safe

and
took
up
the
fictitious

the
naked

scarcely
discernible
but
under
the
magnifying
lenses
of
the
superimposing
glass
all
doubt
was
finally
dispelled
they
were
there
they
corresponded
they
were
identical
thumb
to
thumb
finger
to
finger
and
line
to
line
they
fitted
over
one
another
without
a
blur
or
fault
it
was
as
it
often
proved
to
be
in
those
days
hanging
evidence
salt
relocked
the

out
the
used
pages
of

reduced
them
to
ashes
on
the
spot
the
less
important
remains
of
the
book
he
took
with
him
to
his
chambers
and
there
burned
them
from
cover
to
cover
before
he
went
to
bed
it
had
served
its
purpose
and
not
a
legitimate
trace
remained
around
the
stolen
copy
the
policy
of
the
coming
strife

crystallise
and
towards
any
issue
it
might
raise
salt
could
look
with
confidence
finally
if
the
unforeseen
arose
the
way
was
clear
for
sir
john
to
denounce
a
shameless
forgery
and
who
could
contradict
his
indignant
word
chapter
ix
secret
history
under
succeeding
administrations
each
pledged
to
a
larger
policy
to
themselves
and
a
smaller
one
towards
every
one
else
most
of
the
traditional
outward
forms
of
government
had
continued
to
be
observed
thus
there
was
a
minister
for
the
colonies
though
the
colonies
themselves
had
shamefacedly
one
by
one
dropped
off
into
the
troubled
waters
of
weak
independence
or
else
clung
on
with
pathetic
loyalty
in
spite
of
rebuff
after
rebuff
and
the
disintegration
of
all
mutual
interests
until
nothing
but
the
most
shadowy
bond
remained
there
was
a
secretary
of
state
for
war
in
spite
of
the
fact
that
the
flag
which
the
government
nailed
to
the
mast
when
it
entered
into
negotiations
with
an
aggrieved
and
aggressive
power
bore
the
legend
peace
at
any
price
none
but
a
coward
strikes
the
weak
there
had
been
more
than
one
first
lord
of
the
admiralty
whose
maritime
experience
had
begun
and
ended
on
the
familiar
deck
of
the
there
were
practically
all
the
usual
officers
of
ministerial
rank
and
the
recipients
of
ministerial
salaries
apart
from
the
enjoyment
of
the
title
and
the
salary
however
there
were
a
few
members
of
the
cabinet
who
exercised
no
real
authority
lord
henry
stokes
had
been
the
last
of
upper
class
politicians
of
standing
to
accept
office
under
the
new
largely
in
sympathy
with
the
democratic
tendency
of
the
age
optimistic
as
to
the
growth
of
moderation
and
restraint
in
the
ranks
of
the
mushroom
party
and
actuated
by
the
most
sterling
patriotism
lord
henry
had
essayed
the
superhuman
task
of
premiership
superhuman
it
was
because
no
mortal
could
have
combined
the
qualities
necessary
for
success
in
the
face
of
the
fierce
distrust
and
jealousy
which
his
rank
and
social
position
excited
in
the
minds
of
the
rawer
recruits
of
his
own
party
superhuman
because
no
man
possessing
his
convictions
could
have
long
reconciled
with
them
the
growing
and
not
diminishing
illiberality
of
those
whom
he
was
to
lead
there
were
dissensions
suspicions
and
recriminations
from
the
first
the
end
came
in
a
tragic
scene
unparalleled
among
the
many
historic
spectacles
which
the
house
has
witnessed
a
trivial
point
in
the
naval
estimates
was
under
discussion
and
lord
henry
totally
out
of
sympathy
with
the
bulk
of
his
nominal
following
had
risen
to
patch
up
the
situation
on
the
best
terms
he
could
at
the
end
of
a
studiously
moderate
speech
which
had
provoked
cheers
from
the
opposition
and
murmurs
of
dissent
from
his
own
party
throughout
he
had
wound
up
his
plea
for
unity
toleration
and
patriotism
with
the
following
words
it
is
true
that
here
no
government
measure
is
at
stake
no
crisis
is
involved
and
honourable
members
on
this
side
of
the
house
are
free
of
party
trammels
and
at
liberty
to
vote
as
seems
best
to
each
but
if
the
motion
should
be
persisted
in
an
inevitable
conclusion
must
be
faced
an
irretrievable
step
will
have
been
taken
and
of
the
moral
outcome
of
that
act
who
dare
trace
the
end
there
was
just
a
perceptible
pause
of
sullen
silence
then
from
among
the
compact
mass
that
sat
behind
their
leader
rose
a
coarse
voice
charged
with
a
squiggling
laugh
we
give
it
up
if
it
a
riddle
about
morals
suppose
you
ask
little
flo
it
was
an
aside
it
was
afterwards
claimed
that
it
was
a
drunken
whisper
but
it
was
heard
as
it
was
meant
to
be
heard
throughout
the
crowded
chamber
from
the
opposition
ranks
there
was
torn
a
cry
almost
of
horror
at
the
enormity
of
the
insult
at
the
direful
profanation
of
the
house
responsible
members
of
the
government
turned
angrily
imploringly
frantically
upon
their
followers
at
least
half
of
these
sitting
pained
and
scandalised
needed
no
restraint
but
from
the
malcontents
and
extreme
wings
came
shriek
upon
shriek
of
boisterous
mirth
as
they
rocked
with
laughter
about
their
seats
as
for
lord
henry
sitting
immobile
as
he
scanned
a
paper
in
his
hand
he
did
not
appear
to
have
heard
at
first
nor
even
to
have
noticed
that
anything
unusual
was
taking
place
but
the
next
minute
he
turned
deadly
pale
began
to
tremble
violently
and
with
a
low
and
hurried
your
help
meadowsweet
he
stumbled
from
the
hall
for
twenty
years
he
had
been
a
member
of
the
house
years
of
politics
when
party
strife
ran
strong
but
never
before
had
the
vaguest
innuendo
from
that
unforgotten
past
dropped
from
an
opponent
lips
it
had
been
reserved
for
his
own
party
to
achieve
that
distinction
and
to
exact
the
crowning
phase
of
penance
in
nature
inexorable
cycle
apologists
afterwards
claimed
that
too
much
had
been
made
of
the
incident
that
much
worse
things
were
often
said
and
passed
at
the
meetings
of
boards
of
guardians
and
borough
councils
it
was
as
true
as
it
was
biting
worse
things
were
said
at
borough
councils
and
the
mother
of
parliaments
had
sunk
to
the
rhetorical
level
of
a
borough
council
stokes
never
took
his
seat
again
and
with
him
there
passed
out
of
that
arena
the
last
of
a
hopeful
patriotic
group
whose
only
failure
was
that
they
tried
to
reconcile
two
irreconcilable
forces
of
their
times
it
did
not
result
however
that
no
men
of
social
position
were
to
be
found
among
the
labour
benches
there
was
a
demand
and
there
followed
the
supply
rank
mediocrity
and
moral
obsequiousness
were
the
essentials
for
their
posts
there
were
no
more
stokeses
to
be
had
so
obliging
creatures
were
obtained
who
were
willing
for
a
consideration
to
be
paraded
as
the
successors
to
his
patriotic
mantle
they
were
plainly
made
to
understand
their
position
and
if
they
ventured
to
show
individuality
they
soon
resigned
nominally
occupying
high
offices
they
had
neither
influence
power
nor
respect
like
marlborough
in
compliance
they
had
to
do
it
for
their
bread
they
were
ruled
by
their
junior
lords
assistants
and
underlings
in
various
degrees
many
of
these
men
too
strong
to
be
ignored
were
frankly
recognised
to
be
impossible
in
the
chief
offices
of
state
as
a
consequence
the
cabinet
soon
became
an
empty
form
its
councils
were
still
held
but
the
proceedings
were
cut
and
dried
in
advance
the
real
assembly
that
dictated
the
policy
of
the
government
was
the
expediency
council
held
informally
as
the
necessity
arose
the
gathering
which
was
taking
place
at
the
premier
house
on
this
occasion
had
been
convened
for
the
purpose
of
clearing
the
air
with
regard
to
the
policy
to
be
pursued
at
home
the
government
had
come
into
power
with
very
liberal
ideas
on
the
question
of
what
ought
to
be
done
for
the
working
classes
they
had
made
good
their
promises
and
still
that
free
and
enlightened
body
having
found
by
experience
that
they
only
had
to
ask
often
enough
and
loudly
enough
to
be
met
in
their
demands
were
already
clamouring
for
more
the
most
moderate
section
of
the
government
was
of
opinion
that
the
limit
had
been
reached
others
thought
that
the
limit
lay
yet
a
little
further
on
the
irresponsibles
denied
that
any
limit
could
be
fixed
at
all
that
had
been
the
experience
of
every
administration
for
a
long
time
past
and
each
one
in
turn
had
been
succeeded
by
its
malcontents
mr
strummery
the
premier
did
not
occupy
the
official
residence
provided
for
him
mrs
strummery
an
excellent
lady
who
had
once
been
heard
to
remark
that
she
could
never
understand
why
her
husband
was
called
when
he
was
not
a
at
all
flatly
declared
that
the
work
of
cleaning
the
windows
alone
of
the
house
in
downing
street
put
it
out
of
the
question
even
mr
strummery
who
among
his
political
associates
was
reported
to
have
rather
exalted
ideas
of
the
dignity
of
his
position
came
to
the
conclusion
after
fully
considering
the
residence
from
every
standpoint
that
he
might
not
feel
really
at
home
there
it
was
therefore
let
furnished
to
an
american
lady
who
engineered
wealthy
from
her
native
land
into
the
best
english
society
and
the
strummerys
found
more
congenial
surroundings
in
brandenburg
place
there
within
a
convenient
distance
of
the
hampstead
road
and
other
choice
shopping
centres
mrs
strummery
like
the
wife
of
another
eminent
statesman
whose
statue
stood
almost
within
sight
of
her
bedroom
windows
was
able
to
indulge
in
her
amiable
foible
for
cheap
marketing
and
if
the
two
ladies
had
this
in
common
the
points
of
resemblance
between
their
respective
lords
the
moral
side
excluded
might
be
multiplied
for
no
phrase
put
into
mr
strummery
mouth
could
epigrammatise
his
point
of
view
more
concisely
than
fox
inopportune
toast
our
sovereign
the
people
dispassionate
comment
was
that
the
sentiment
which
lost
the
abler
man
his
privy
councillorship
in
his
day
gained
for
the
other
a
premiership
a
century
later
one
thing
that
gets
me
is
why
no
one
ever
seems
to
take
any
notice
of
us
when
we
have
a
council
on
remarked
the
president
of
the
board
of
education
with
an
involuntary
plaint
in
his
voice
he
was
standing
on
the
balcony
outside
the
large
front
room
on
mr
strummery
first
floor
a
room
which
boasted
the
noble
proportions
of
a
and
possibly
served
as
one
in
georgian
days
certainly
brandenburg
place
did
not
present
a
spectacle
of
fluttering
animation
at
the
prospect
of
seeing
the
great
ones
of
the
land
assembling
within
its
bounds
at
one
end
of
the
thoroughfare
a
milkman
was
going
from
area
to
area
with
a
prolonged
melancholy
cry
more
suggestive
of
stoke
poges
churchyard
than
of
any
other
spot
on
earth
at
the
opposite
end
a
grocer
errand
boy
with
basket
resourcefully
inverted
upon
his
head
had
sunk
down
by
the
railings
to
sip
the
nectar
from
a
few
more
pages
of
iroquois
ike
last
hope
or
the
phantom
bride
midway
between
the
two
a
cat
in
the
act
of
crossing
the
road
had
stopped
to
twitch
a
forepaw
with
that
air
of
imperturbable
deliberateness
in
its
movements
that
no
other
created
thing
can
ever
succeed
in
attaining
in
a
house
opposite
some
one
was
rattling
off
the
exhilarating
strains
of
humming
ephraim
but
even
when
a
hansom
cab
and
two
drove
up
in
quick
succession
to
the
premier
door
no
one
betrayed
curiosity
to
the
extent
of
looking
out
of
the
window
the
minister
of
education
noted
these
things
as
he
stood
on
the
balcony
and
possibly
he
felt
another
phase
of
the
gratitude
of
men
that
often
left
mr
wordsworth
mourning
i
can
remember
the
time
when
crowds
used
to
wait
hours
in
the
rain
along
downing
street
our
people
too
to
catch
a
sight
of
estair
or
nettlebury
i
wo
exactly
say
that
it
annoys
me
because
i
seen
too
much
of
the
hollowness
of
things
for
that
but
it
certainly
is
rummy
why
it
should
be
so
a
very
good
thing
too
commented
the
premier
briskly
from
the
room
i
do
know
that
we
could
have
a
greater
compliment
the
people
know
that
we
are
plain
straightforward
men
like
themselves
and
they
know
that
we
are
doing
our
work
without
having
to
come
and
see
us
at
it
they
do
regard
us
almost
as
little
deities
interesting
to
see
but
quite
different
and
above
themselves
that
why
every
one
in
the
room
said
hear
hear
as
though
that
exactly
defined
his
own
sentiments
and
every
one
in
the
room
looked
rather
sad
as
though
at
the
back
of
their
collective
minds
there
lurked
a
doubt
whether
it
might
not
be
more
pleasant
to
be
regarded
almost
as
little
deities
you
need
go
as
far
back
as
estair
and
nettlebury
put
in
vossit
of
the
treasury
see
how
they
fairly
round
hampden
whenever
about
not
us
interposed
another
man
emphatically
let
them
go
on
their
own
messin
way
it
do
us
no
harm
you
never
saw
a
working
man
at
any
of
their
high
and
mighty
meetings
so
much
the
worse
for
they
did
want
them
but
there
ought
to
have
been
working
men
there
from
the
very
first
meeting
until
now
the
speaker
was
one
of
the
most
recent
additions
to
the
potent
circle
of
the
brandenburg
place
councils
and
the
freedom
of
criticism
which
he
allowed
himself
had
already
been
the
subject
of
pained
comment
on
the
part
of
a
section
of
his
seniors
well
suggested
some
one
with
meaning
i
do
know
what
to
prevent
one
individual
from
attending
a
meeting
if
he
so
wants
he
probably
find
one
going
on
somewhere
at
this
minute
if
he
looked
round
hard
does
seem
to
me
that
any
one
holding
him
back
now
now
reproved
mr
guppling
the
let
the
man
speak
if
he
has
anything
on
his
mind
come
now
comrade
what
do
you
mean
i
do
know
what
i
mean
replied
the
comrade
at
which
there
was
a
general
shout
of
laughter
i
do
know
what
i
mean
he
continued
having
secured
general
attention
by
this
simple
device
of
oratory
because
i
am
told
in
those
government
quarters
where
i
ought
to
be
able
to
find
information
that
no
information
has
been
collected
no
systematic
enquiries
made
nothing
is
known
in
fact
therefore
i
do
not
know
what
i
mean
because
i
do
not
know
none
of
us
know
what
the
unity
league
means
but
i
know
this
that
a
hostile
organisation
of
over
a
million
and
a
half
strong
dissent
came
forcibly
from
every
quarter
of
the
room
not
half
was
the
milder
form
it
of
over
a
million
and
a
half
strong
continued
the
speaker
grimly
perhaps
more
in
fact
than
all
our
trades
unions
put
together
with
an
income
very
little
less
than
what
all
the
trades
unions
put
together
used
to
have
and
funds
in
hand
probably
more
is
a
living
menace
in
our
midst
and
ought
to
have
been
closely
watched
it
keeps
quiet
urged
the
foreign
too
quiet
i
do
like
my
enemy
to
be
quiet
i
prefer
him
to
be
talking
large
and
telling
us
exactly
what
he
going
to
do
they
going
to
chuck
us
out
tirrel
that
what
they
going
to
do
said
a
sarcastic
comrade
playfully
so
was
the
buttercup
league
so
was
the
alliance
lo
history
repeats
itself
i
see
a
long
line
of
strong
men
fallen
in
the
past
premiers
popes
kings
generals
ambassadors
replied
tirrel
they
all
took
it
for
granted
that
when
they
had
got
their
positions
they
could
keep
them
without
troubling
about
their
enemies
any
more
that
generally
the
repeating
point
in
history
mr
strummery
felt
that
the
instances
were
perhaps
getting
too
near
home
come
come
chaps
and
comrade
tirrel
in
particular
he
said
mildly
do
imagine
that
nothing
is
being
done
in
the
proper
quarter
because
you
may
hear
much
talk
about
it
our
executives
work
and
do
talk
i
think
that
you
may
trust
our
good
comrade
tubes
to
keep
an
eye
on
the
unity
league
wish
he
keep
an
eye
on
the
clock
murmured
a
captious
member
not
once
he
added
conclusively
but
three
times
out
of
four
there
was
a
vigorous
knock
at
the
front
door
and
the
hurried
footsteps
of
some
one
ascending
the
stairs
with
the
consciousness
that
he
was
late
talk
of
tubes
and
you
have
a
puncture
confided
a
comrade
of
humorous
bent
to
his
neighbour
and
on
the
words
the
home
secretary
certainly
with
very
little
breath
left
in
him
entered
the
room
and
made
his
apologies
the
special
business
for
which
the
council
had
been
called
together
was
to
consider
a
series
of
reports
from
the
constituencies
and
to
decide
how
to
be
influenced
by
their
tenor
the
government
had
no
desire
to
wait
for
a
general
election
in
order
to
find
out
the
views
of
the
electors
of
the
country
given
a
close
summary
of
those
sentiments
it
might
be
possible
to
fall
in
with
their
wishes
and
thereby
to
be
spared
the
anxiety
of
an
election
until
their
septennial
existence
had
run
its
course
or
if
forced
by
the
action
of
their
own
malcontents
to
take
that
unwelcome
step
at
least
to
cut
the
ground
from
beneath
their
opponents
feet
in
advance
if
there
was
not
complete
unanimity
among
those
present
there
was
no
distinct
line
of
variance
men
of
the
extremest
views
had
naturally
not
been
included
and
although
the
prevailing
opinion
was
that
the
conditions
of
labour
had
been
put
upon
a
fair
and
equitable
basis
during
their
tenure
of
office
or
as
far
in
that
direction
as
it
was
possible
to
go
without
utterly
stampeding
capitalists
and
ratepayers
from
the
country
there
were
many
who
were
prepared
to
go
yet
a
little
further
if
it
seemed
desirable
judging
from
the
summarised
reports
it
did
seem
desirable
from
the
mills
of
lancashire
and
yorkshire
the
of
the
north
and
west
the
iron
fields
of
the
midlands
the
quarries
of
derbyshire
the
boot
factories
of
northampton
and
the
lace
factories
of
nottingham
from
every
swarming
port
around
the
coast
and
from
that
vast
cosmopolitan
clearing
house
the
capital
itself
came
the
same
tale
the
people
did
not
find
themselves
so
well
off
as
they
wished
to
be
they
were
in
fact
rather
poorer
than
before
there
was
nothing
local
about
it
the
thurso
hewer
shared
the
symptoms
with
his
celtic
brother
digging
out
tin
and
copper
from
beneath
the
atlantic
waters
beyond
pendeen
the
pembroke
and
the
ipswich
mechanic
were
in
just
the
same
position
when
industries
collapsed
as
industries
had
an
unhappy
character
for
doing
about
the
period
no
one
had
any
reserves
it
was
possible
to
live
by
provision
of
the
government
but
the
working
man
had
been
educated
up
to
requiring
a
great
deal
more
than
bare
living
when
wages
went
down
in
spite
of
all
artificial
inflation
or
short
time
was
declared
a
great
many
houses
financed
from
week
to
week
but
up
to
the
hilt
in
debt
went
down
too
the
agricultural
labourer
was
the
least
disturbed
he
had
had
the
least
done
for
him
and
he
had
never
known
a
boom
the
paradox
remained
that
with
more
money
the
majority
of
the
poor
were
poorer
than
before
and
they
were
worse
than
poor
for
they
were
dissatisfied
the
remedy
of
course
was
for
some
one
to
give
them
still
more
money
not
for
them
to
spend
less
the
shortest
way
to
that
remedy
as
they
had
been
well
taught
by
their
agitators
in
the
past
was
to
clamour
for
the
government
to
do
something
else
for
them
and
therefore
they
were
clamouring
now
that
is
the
position
announced
mr
tubes
when
he
had
finished
reading
the
general
summary
the
question
it
raises
may
not
be
exactly
urgent
but
it
is
at
least
pressing
on
the
one
hand
there
is
the
undoubted
feeling
of
grievance
existing
among
a
large
proportion
of
electors
our
own
people
on
the
other
hand
there
is
the
serious
question
of
national
finances
not
to
be
overlooked
as
the
matter
is
one
that
must
ultimately
concern
me
more
closely
than
anybody
else
i
will
reserve
my
own
opinion
to
the
last
the
view
taken
by
those
present
has
already
been
indicated
their
platform
was
that
of
moderate
socialism
they
wished
it
always
to
be
understood
that
they
were
practical
they
had
the
interest
of
their
fellow
working
men
certainly
of
no
other
class
of
the
community
at
heart
but
as
practical
socialists
they
had
a
suspicion
taking
the
condition
of
the
exchequer
into
consideration
that
for
the
moment
they
had
reached
the
limit
of
practical
socialism
there
was
an
undoubted
dilemma
if
a
mistake
of
policy
on
their
part
let
in
the
impractical
socialists
the
result
would
be
disastrous
most
of
them
regarded
the
danger
as
infinitesimal
like
every
other
political
party
during
the
last
two
centuries
they
felt
that
they
could
rely
on
the
sound
of
the
community
still
admitting
a
possibility
even
if
it
was
microscopic
might
it
not
be
more
say
practically
socialistic
the
word
patriotic
had
long
been
expunged
from
their
vocabulary
in
the
end
to
make
some
slight
concessions
if
there
existed
a
more
material
inducement
it
was
not
referred
to
and
any
ingenuous
comrade
using
as
an
argument
in
favour
of
compliance
a
homely
proverb
anent
the
inadvisability
of
quarrelling
with
one
bread
and
butter
would
have
been
promptly
discouraged
yet
although
the
actors
themselves
in
this
great
morality
play
apparently
overlooked
the
consideration
it
is
impossible
for
the
spectator
to
ignore
the
fact
some
few
members
of
the
cabinet
might
have
provided
for
a
rainy
day
but
even
to
many
of
official
class
and
practically
to
all
of
the
rank
and
file
a
reversal
at
the
polls
must
mean
that
they
would
have
to
give
up
a
variety
of
privileges
and
return
to
private
life
in
less
interesting
capacities
some
in
very
humble
ones
indeed
it
ended
as
it
was
bound
to
end
in
compromise
they
would
not
play
into
the
hands
of
the
extreme
party
and
ignore
the
voice
of
the
constituencies
they
would
not
be
false
to
their
convictions
and
be
dictated
to
by
the
electors
they
would
decline
to
bring
in
the
suggested
minimum
wage
bill
and
they
would
not
impose
the
personal
property
tax
they
would
meet
matters
by
extending
the
national
obligations
act
and
save
money
on
the
estimates
they
would
be
sound
if
commonplace
the
formal
proceedings
having
been
concluded
it
was
open
for
any
one
to
introduce
any
subject
he
pleased
in
terms
of
censure
enquiry
or
discussion
comrade
tirrel
was
on
his
feet
at
once
and
returned
to
the
subject
that
lay
heavy
on
his
mind
is
the
home
secretary
in
possession
of
any
confidential
information
regarding
the
unity
league
he
demanded
and
can
he
assure
us
in
view
of
the
admittedly
hostile
object
of
the
organisation
that
adequate
means
are
being
taken
to
neutralise
any
possible
lines
of
action
it
may
adopt
the
answer
to
the
first
part
of
the
question
is
in
the
affirmative
replied
mr
tubes
in
his
best
parliamentary
manner
as
regards
the
second
part
i
may
state
that
after
considering
the
reports
we
have
received
it
is
not
anticipated
that
the
league
offers
any
serious
menace
to
the
government
should
the
necessity
arise
the
council
may
rely
upon
the
home
office
taking
the
requisite
precautions
the
answer
is
satisfactory
as
far
as
it
goes
being
in
possession
of
special
information
will
the
home
secretary
go
a
step
further
and
allay
the
anxiety
that
certainly
exists
in
some
quarters
by
indicating
the
real
intentions
and
proposed
of
the
league
mr
tubes
conferred
for
a
moment
with
his
chief
i
may
say
that
on
broad
lines
the
league
has
no
definite
plan
for
the
future
and
its
intentions
as
represented
by
the
policy
of
its
heads
will
simply
be
to
go
on
existing
so
long
as
the
deluded
followers
will
continue
their
subscriptions
i
may
point
out
that
the
league
has
now
been
in
existence
for
two
years
and
during
that
time
it
has
done
nothing
at
all
to
justify
its
founders
expectations
it
has
not
embarrassed
us
at
any
point
nor
turned
a
single
for
two
years
we
heard
practically
nothing
of
it
and
there
has
been
no
fresh
development
to
justify
the
present
uneasiness
which
it
seems
to
be
causing
in
the
minds
of
a
few
nervous
comrades
its
membership
is
admittedly
imposing
but
the
bare
fact
that
a
million
and
a
half
of
people
are
foolish
enough
there
was
a
significant
exchange
of
astonished
glances
among
the
occupants
of
mr
strummery
council
chamber
murmurs
grew
and
mr
guppling
voiced
the
general
feeling
by
calling
the
home
attention
to
the
figures
he
had
mentioned
doubtless
inadvertently
no
admitted
mr
tubes
carelessly
that
is
our
latest
estimate
from
recent
information
we
have
reason
to
think
that
the
previous
figure
we
adopted
was
too
low
or
the
league
may
have
received
large
additions
lately
through
some
accidental
cause
we
are
now
probably
erring
as
widely
on
the
other
side
but
it
is
the
safe
side
and
i
therefore
retain
that
figure
mr
tirrel
had
not
yet
finished
but
he
was
listened
to
with
respectful
attention
now
is
the
home
secretary
in
a
position
to
tell
us
who
this
man
salt
is
was
his
next
enquiry
the
home
secretary
looked
frankly
puzzled
who
salt
he
replied
innocently
enough
that
is
the
essential
point
of
my
enquiry
replied
the
comrade
salt
he
continued
his
voice
stilling
the
laughter
it
had
raised
is
the
man
behind
the
unity
league
you
think
it
is
hampden
but
i
tell
you
that
you
are
mistaken
hampden
is
undoubtedly
a
dangerous
power
the
classes
will
follow
him
blindly
and
he
is
no
mere
but
it
was
salt
who
stirred
hampden
from
his
apathy
and
it
is
salt
who
pulls
the
wires
and
who
is
salt
demanded
the
premier
as
mr
tubes
offered
no
comment
tirrel
shook
his
head
i
know
no
more
than
i
have
stated
he
replied
but
his
secret
influence
must
be
tremendous
and
all
doubt
as
to
the
identity
of
the
man
and
his
past
record
should
be
set
at
rest
mr
tubes
looked
up
from
the
papers
he
had
before
him
with
a
gleam
of
subdued
anger
in
his
eye
i
think
that
our
kumred
has
geete
howd
of
another
mare
neest
he
remarked
relapsing
unconsciously
into
his
native
dialect
as
he
frequently
did
when
stirred
i
remember
hearin
o
this
saut
in
one
o
th
reports
and
here
it
is
so
far
from
being
a
principal
he
occupies
a
very
different
position
that
of
hampden
private
secretary
which
would
explain
how
he
might
have
to
come
into
contact
with
a
great
many
people
without
having
any
real
influence
hissel
he
is
described
in
my
confidential
report
as
a
simple
unsuspicious
man
who
might
be
safely
made
use
of
and
in
fact
most
of
my
information
is
derived
from
that
source
there
was
a
sharp
smothered
exclamation
from
one
or
two
men
and
then
a
sudden
stillness
fell
upon
the
room
mr
tubes
was
among
the
last
to
realise
the
trend
of
his
admission
are
we
to
understand
that
the
greater
part
perhaps
the
whole
of
the
information
upon
which
the
home
office
has
been
relying
and
of
the
assurances
of
inaction
which
have
lulled
our
suspicions
to
rest
have
been
blindly
accepted
from
this
man
salt
the
head
and
fount
of
the
league
itself
demanded
tirrel
with
ominous
precision
if
that
indicates
the
methods
of
the
department
i
think
that
this
council
will
share
my
view
when
i
suggest
that
the
terms
and
have
been
inaccurately
allotted
to
salt
mr
tubes
made
no
reply
lying
at
the
bottom
of
the
man
nature
smouldered
a
volcanic
passion
that
he
watched
as
though
it
were
a
sleeping
beast
twice
in
his
public
career
it
had
escaped
him
and
each
time
the
result
had
been
a
sharp
reverse
to
his
ambitions
repression
firm
instant
and
unconditional
was
the
only
safeguard
so
that
now
recognising
the
in
his
breast
he
sat
without
a
word
in
spite
of
the
premier
anxious
looks
in
spite
of
the
concern
of
those
about
him
i
will
not
press
for
a
verbal
reply
continued
tirrel
after
a
telling
pause
the
inference
of
silence
makes
that
superfluous
but
i
will
ask
whether
the
home
secretary
is
aware
that
salt
has
been
quietly
engaged
in
canvassing
the
provinces
for
a
month
and
whether
he
has
any
information
about
his
object
and
results
yes
he
continued
vehemently
turning
to
those
immediately
about
him
for
a
month
past
this
simple
unsuspecting
individual
from
whom
we
derive
our
confidential
information
has
been
passing
quietly
and
unmarked
from
town
to
town
and
if
you
were
to
hang
a
map
of
england
on
the
wall
before
me
i
would
undertake
to
trace
his
route
across
the
land
by
the
points
of
most
marked
discontent
in
the
report
to
which
we
have
just
listened
a
knock
at
the
locked
door
of
the
room
saved
the
home
secretary
for
the
moment
from
the
necessity
of
replying
it
was
an
unusual
incident
and
when
the
nearest
man
went
and
asked
what
was
wanted
some
one
was
understood
to
reply
that
a
stranger
who
refused
to
give
his
name
wished
to
see
mr
tubes
perhaps
mr
tubes
personally
might
have
welcomed
a
respite
but
the
master
of
the
house
anticipated
him
tell
him
whoever
he
may
be
that
mr
tubes
can
not
be
disturbed
just
now
he
declared
he
says
it
important
very
important
urged
the
voice
with
a
suggestion
of
largess
received
and
more
to
come
in
its
eagerness
then
let
him
write
it
down
or
wait
said
mr
strummery
decisively
and
the
matter
was
supposed
to
have
ended
the
momentary
interruption
had
broken
the
tension
and
perhaps
saved
tubes
from
a
passionate
outburst
he
rose
to
make
a
reply
without
any
sign
of
anger
or
any
fear
that
he
would
not
be
able
to
smooth
away
the
awkward
impression
as
far
as
canvassing
in
the
provinces
is
concerned
he
remarked
plausibly
it
is
open
for
any
man
whatever
his
politics
may
be
to
do
that
from
morning
to
night
all
his
life
if
he
likes
so
long
as
it
for
an
illegal
object
as
regards
salt
having
been
engaged
this
way
for
the
past
month
it
is
quite
true
that
i
have
had
no
intimation
of
the
fact
so
far
i
may
explain
that
as
my
department
has
not
yet
come
to
regard
the
unity
league
as
the
one
object
in
the
world
to
which
it
must
devote
its
whole
attention
i
am
not
in
the
habit
of
receiving
reports
on
the
subject
every
day
nor
even
every
week
it
may
be
however
there
was
another
knock
upon
the
door
mr
tubes
stopped
and
the
premier
frowned
in
the
space
between
the
door
and
the
carpet
there
appeared
for
a
second
a
scrap
of
paper
the
next
moment
it
came
skimming
a
few
yards
into
the
room
there
was
no
attempt
to
hold
further
communication
and
the
footsteps
of
the
silent
messenger
were
heard
descending
the
stairs
again
mr
vossit
who
sat
nearest
to
the
door
picked
up
the
little
oblong
card
he
saw
as
he
could
scarcely
fail
to
see
that
it
was
an
ordinary
and
on
the
upper
side
as
it
lay
there
appeared
a
sign
two
lines
at
right
angle
drawn
through
a
semicircle
it
appeared
superficially
to
be
as
he
handed
it
to
mr
tubes
he
reversed
the
position
so
that
the
name
should
be
uppermost
and
again
he
saw
as
he
could
scarcely
fail
to
see
that
the
other
side
was
blank
the
diagram
was
all
the
message
it
contained
it
may
be
however
the
home
secretary
was
repeating
he
took
the
card
and
glanced
at
the
symbol
it
bore
it
may
be
however
he
continued
as
though
there
had
been
no
interruption
that
i
shall
very
soon
be
in
possession
of
the
full
facts
to
lay
before
you
then
with
a
few
whispered
words
to
the
premier
and
a
comprehensive
murmur
of
apology
to
the
rest
of
the
company
he
withdrew
fully
a
quarter
of
an
hour
passed
before
there
was
any
sign
of
the
absent
minister
and
then
it
did
not
take
the
form
of
his
return
the
conversation
in
his
absence
had
worked
round
to
the
engaging
alternative
of
whether
it
was
more
correct
to
educate
one
son
at
eton
or
at
margate
college
when
a
message
was
sent
up
requesting
the
premier
attendance
in
another
room
after
another
quarter
of
an
hour
some
one
was
heard
to
leave
the
house
but
it
was
ten
minutes
later
before
the
two
men
returned
it
was
felt
in
the
atmosphere
that
some
new
development
was
at
hand
and
they
had
to
run
the
curious
scrutiny
of
every
eye
both
had
an
air
of
constraint
and
both
were
rather
pale
the
premier
moved
to
his
seat
with
brusque
indifference
and
one
who
knew
tubes
well
passed
a
whispered
warning
that
jim
had
got
his
fairly
hoisted
the
door
was
locked
again
chairs
were
drawn
up
to
the
table
and
a
hush
of
marked
expectancy
settled
over
the
meeting
the
prime
minister
spoke
first
in
the
past
a
letter
has
come
into
our
possession
that
may
cause
us
to
alter
our
arrangements
he
announced
baldly
how
it
came
into
our
possession
does
matter
all
that
does
matter
is
that
genuine
tubes
will
read
it
to
you
it
is
signed
hampden
addressed
to
robert
estair
and
dated
three
days
ago
contributed
the
home
secretary
just
as
briefly
the
original
was
in
cipher
this
is
the
deciphered
form
dear
estair
i
now
have
salt
complete
report
before
me
and
there
seems
to
be
no
doubt
that
the
proposal
i
have
formulated
is
feasible
and
the
moment
almost
ripe
salt
has
covered
all
the
most
important
industrial
centres
and
everywhere
the
reports
of
our
agents
are
favourable
to
the
plan
not
having
found
universal
happiness
and
a
complete
immunity
from
the
cares
incident
to
humanity
in
the
privileges
which
they
so
ardently
desired
and
have
now
obtained
the
working
classes
are
tending
to
believe
that
the
panacea
must
lie
not
in
greater
moderation
but
in
extended
privilege
the
moment
the
present
government
is
indisposed
to
go
much
further
not
possessing
the
funds
necessary
for
enlarged
concessions
and
fearing
that
increased
taxation
might
result
in
a
serious
stream
of
emigration
among
the
monied
classes
for
the
moment
the
working
men
hesitate
to
throw
in
their
lot
with
the
extreme
socialists
distrusting
the
revolutionary
and
anarchical
wing
of
that
party
and
instinctively
feeling
that
any
temporary
advantage
which
they
might
enjoy
would
soon
be
swallowed
up
in
the
reign
of
open
lawlessness
that
must
inevitably
arise
the
moment
therefore
there
is
a
pause
and
now
occurs
the
opportunity
perhaps
the
last
in
history
for
us
to
retrieve
some
of
the
losses
of
the
past
there
are
scruples
to
be
overcome
but
i
do
not
think
that
an
alliance
with
the
moderate
section
of
the
labour
interest
is
inconsistent
with
the
aims
and
traditions
of
the
great
parties
which
our
league
represents
it
would
of
course
be
necessary
to
guarantee
to
our
new
allies
the
privileges
which
they
now
possess
and
even
to
promise
more
but
i
am
convinced
not
only
by
past
experience
but
also
by
specific
assurances
from
certain
quarters
that
they
would
prefer
to
remain
as
they
are
and
form
an
alliance
with
us
rather
than
grasp
at
larger
gains
and
suffer
absorption
into
another
party
which
they
dare
not
trust
the
definite
nature
of
this
statement
you
will
gather
that
the
negotiations
are
more
than
in
the
air
the
distribution
of
cabinet
offices
will
have
to
be
considered
at
once
b
might
be
first
gained
over
with
the
offer
of
the
exchequer
he
carries
great
weight
with
a
considerable
section
of
his
party
and
is
dissatisfied
with
his
recognition
so
far
heape
is
a
representative
man
who
would
repay
early
attention
especially
as
he
is
at
the
moment
envious
of
r
better
treatment
but
these
are
matters
of
detail
the
great
thing
is
to
back
on
any
once
in
power
by
a
modification
of
the
franchise
we
might
make
good
our
position
i
trust
that
this
a
desperate
remedy
in
a
desperate
time
will
earn
at
least
your
tacit
acquiescence
much
is
irretrievably
lost
england
remains
yet
yours
sincerely
john
hampden
six
men
were
on
their
feet
before
the
signature
was
reached
with
an
impatient
gesture
strummery
waved
them
collectively
aside
we
all
know
your
opinion
on
the
writer
and
the
letter
and
we
can
all
put
it
into
our
own
words
without
wasting
time
in
listening
he
said
with
suppressed
fury
in
five
minutes
time
i
shall
entirely
reopen
the
consideration
of
the
reports
which
we
met
this
afternoon
to
discuss
has
any
effort
been
made
to
learn
the
nature
of
estair
reply
enquired
tirrel
if
he
was
not
the
least
moved
man
in
the
room
he
was
the
least
perturbed
and
he
instinctively
picked
out
the
only
point
of
importance
that
remained
it
probably
does
not
exist
in
writing
replied
mr
tubes
avoiding
tirrel
steady
gaze
i
find
that
he
arrived
in
town
last
night
there
would
certainly
be
a
meeting
was
bannister
summoned
to
this
council
demanded
another
it
was
taken
for
granted
that
b
stood
for
bannister
yes
replied
the
premier
with
one
eye
on
his
watch
he
was
indisposed
i
protest
against
the
reference
to
myself
said
heape
coldly
mr
strummery
nodded
time
up
he
announced
that
is
the
secret
history
of
the
government
sudden
and
inexplicable
conversion
to
the
necessity
of
the
minimum
wage
bill
and
to
the
propriety
of
imposing
the
personal
property
tax
a
fortnight
later
the
prime
minister
outlined
the
programme
in
the
course
of
a
speech
at
newcastle
the
announcement
was
received
almost
with
stupefaction
for
the
first
time
in
history
property
money
merchandise
personal
belongings
was
to
be
saddled
with
an
annual
tax
apart
from
and
in
addition
to
the
tax
it
paid
on
the
incomes
derived
from
it
it
was
an
entire
wedge
of
the
extreme
policy
that
must
end
in
partition
it
was
more
than
the
poorer
classes
had
dared
to
hope
it
was
more
than
the
classes
had
dared
to
fear
it
marked
a
new
era
of
extended
privilege
for
the
one
it
marked
the
final
extinction
of
hope
even
among
the
hopeful
for
the
other
it
could
not
have
happened
more
opportunely
for
us
even
if
we
had
arranged
it
in
every
detail
declared
hampden
going
into
salt
room
with
the
tidings
in
huge
delight
a
fortnight
later
no
agreed

up
with
his
slow
pleasant
smile

even
if
we
had
arranged
it
chapter
x
the
order
of
st
martin
of
tours
sir
john
hampden
paused
for
a
moment
with
arrested
pen
he
had
been
in
the
act
of
crossing
off
another
day
on
the
calendar
that
hung
inside
his
desk
the
last
detail
before
he
pulled
the
down
for
the
night
when
the
date
had
caught
his
eye
with
a
sudden
meaning
a
week
salt
he
remarked
looking
up
a
week
repeated
salt
that
gives
us
seven
more
days
for
details
hampden
laughed
quietly
as
he
bent
forward
and
continued
the
red
line
through
the
that
is
one
way
of
looking
at
it
he
said
personally
i
was
rather
wishing
that
it
had
been
i
confess
that
i
can
not
watch
the
climax
of
these
two
years
approaching
without
feeling
keyed
up
to
concert
pitch
i
suppose
that
you
never
had
any
nerves
i
suppose
not
if
i
had
the
atlantic
water
soon
washed
them
out
but
you
are
superstitious
he
asked
curiously
it
suddenly
occurred
to
him
how
little
he
really
knew
of
the
man
with
whom
he
was
linked
in
such
a
momentous
hazard
oh
yes
blue
water
inoculates
us
all
with
that
fortunately
mine
does
not
go
beyond
trifles
such
as
touching
posts
and
stepping
over
paving
stones
a
hobby
and
not
a
passion
or
i
should
have
to
curb
it
do
you
really
do
things
like
that
well
i
remember
northland
the
great
nerve
specialist
telling
me
that
most
people
have
something
of
the
sort
a
persistent
feeling
of
impending
calamity
unless
they
conform
to
some
trivial
impulse
i
am
exempt
yes
commented
salt
or
you
would
hardly
be
likely
to
cross
off
the
date
before
the
day
is
over
good
heavens
exclaimed
hampden
what
an
age
we
live
in
is
it
tannin
or
the
dregs
of
paganism
and
you
think
it
would
be
tempting
providence
to
do
it
while
there
are
five
more
hours
to
run
i
never
do
it
as
a
matter
of
fact
admitted
salt
with
perfect
seriousness
of
course
i
that
nothing
would
happen
in
the
five
hours
if
i
did
but
all
the
same
i
rather
think
that
something
would
i
hope
that
something
will
said
hampden
cheerfully
dinner
for
example
did
i
ever
strike
you
as
a
gourmet
salt
well
nevertheless
i
am
a
terrific
believer
in
regular
meals
although
i
do
care
a
straw
how
simple
they
are
you
may
read
of
some
marvellous
trojan
working
under
heavy
pressure
for
hours
and
then
snatching
a
hurried
glass
of
château
and
a
couple
of
abernethy
biscuits
and
going
on
again
for
another
do
believe
it
salt
if
he
is
not
used
to
it
his
knees
go
if
he
is
used
to
it
they
have
gone
already
if
i
were
a
general
i
solemnly
declare
that
i
would
risk
more
to
feed
my
men
before
an
engagement
than
i
would
risk
to
hold
the
best
position
all
along
the
front
your
hungry
man
may
fight
well
enough
for
a
time
but
the
moment
he
is
beaten
he
knows
it
and
strangely
enough
we
english
have
won
a
good
many
important
battles
after
we
had
been
beaten
he
had
been
locking
up
the
safe
and
desk
as
he
ran
on
and
now
they
walked
together
down
the
corridor
at
the
door
of
his
own
office
salt
excused
himself
for
a
moment
and
went
in
when
he
rejoined
the
baronet
at
the
outer
door
he
held
in
his
hand
a
little
square
of
thin
paper
on
which
was
printed
in
bold
type
july
you
will
regret
it
said
hampden
not
wholly
jestingly
he
saw
at
once
that
it
was
the
tag
for
the
day
torn
from
his
calendar
that
salt
held
no
he
replied
crumpling
up
the
scrap
of
paper
and
throwing
it
away
i
may
remember
but
i
shall
not
regret
when
you
have
to
think
twice
about
doing
a
thing
like
that
it
is
time
to
do
it
you
have
no
particular
message
for
deland
none
at
all
personally
i
think
you
will
tell
him
as
much
as
we
decided
upon
let
him
know
that
his
post
will
certainly
be
one
of
the
most
important
outside
the
central
office
what
time
do
you
go
the
train
from
marylebone
deland
will
be
waiting
up
for
me
there
is
an
early
restaurant
train
in
the
morning
the
getting
in
at
i
shall
breakfast
and
come
straight
on
here
that
right
look
out
for
young
hampshire
in
the
train
he
will
probably
wait
on
you
but
you
wo
recognise
him
unless
you
remember
the
nose
in
profile
he
regards
it
as
a
vast
joke
but
he
is
very
keen
and
sleep
all
the
time
you
are
feeding
ca
do
better
good
night
salt
laughed
as
he
turned
into
pall
mall
speculating
for
a
moment
by
the
light
of
his
own
knowledge
how
little
time
this
strenuous
man
devoted
to
the
things
he
advocated
if
he
had
been
able
to
follow
sir
john
electric
brougham
for
the
remainder
of
that
night
he
would
have
had
still
more
reason
to
be
sceptical
when
hampden
reached
his
house
and
strode
up
to
the
door
with
the
elastic
step
of
a
young
man
despite
his
hair
and
burden
of
responsibility
instead
of
the
bronze
medusa
knocker
that
had
dropped
from
the
hands
of
pietro
sarpi
and
donato
in
its
time
his
eyes
encountered
the
smiling
face
of
his
daughter
as
she
swung
open
the
door
before
him
she
had
been
sitting
at
an
open
window
of
the
house
until
she
saw
the
hampden
livery
in
the
distance
there
is
some
one
waiting
in
the
library
to
see
you
she
said
as
he
kissed
her
cheek
he
said
that
he
would
wait
ten
minutes
you
had
already
been
seven
who
is
it
he
asked
in
quiet
expectation
it
was
not
unusual
for
muriel
to
watch
for
him
from
the
upper
room
and
to
come
down
into
the
hall
to
welcome
him
but
he
saw
at
once
that
there
was
a
mild
excitement
in
her
manner
who
is
it
he
asked
she
told
him
in
half
a
dozen
whispered
words
and
then
returned
to
the
and
the
society
of
a
depressing
companion
who
chanced
to
be
a
poor
and
distant
cousin
while
sir
john
turned
toward
the
library
tell
styles
to
remain
with
the
brougham
if
he
is
still
in
front
he
said
to
a
passing
footman
the
visit
might
presage
anything
a
young
man
an
inconspicuous
young
man
in
a
blue
serge
suit
rose
from
the
chair
of
jacobean
oak
and
spanish
leather
where
he
had
been
sitting
with
a
bowler
hat
between
his
hands
and
a
cheap
umbrella
across
his
knees
and
made
a
cursory
bow
as
he
began
to
search
an
inner
pocket
sir
john
hampden
he
enquired
yes
replied
the
master
of
the
house
favouring
his
visitor
with
a
more
curious
attention
than
he
received
in
return
you
are
from
plantagenet
house
i
believe
the
young
man
detached
his
left
hand
from
the
search
and
turned
down
the
lapel
of
his
coat
in
a
perfunctory
display
of
his
credentials
pinned
beneath
so
that
it
should
not
obtrude
was
an
insignificant
little
medal
so
small
and
trivial
that
it
would
require
the
closest
scrutiny
to
distinguish
its
design
and
lettering
but
sir
john
hampden
did
not
require
any
assurance
upon
the
point
he
knew
by
the
evidence
of
just
such
another
medallion
which
lay
in
his
own
possession
that
upon
one
side
around
the
engraved
name
of
the
holder
ran
the
inscription
every
man
according
as
he
purposeth
in
his
heart
upon
the
other
side
a
representation
of
st
martin
dividing
his
cloak
with
the
beggar
it
was
the
badge
of
the
order
of
st
martin
of
tours
the
order
of
st
martin
embodied
the
last
phase
of
organised
benevolence
in
the
history
of
the
world
there
had
never
been
a
time
when
men
so
passionately
desired
to
help
their
fellow
men
there
had
never
been
a
time
when
they
found
it
more
difficult
to
do
so
to
their
satisfaction
from
the
lips
of
every
social
reformer
from
the
reports
of
the
charitable
organisations
from
the
testimony
of
the
poor
themselves
the
broad
indictment
had
gone
forth
that
every
casual
beggar
was
a
rogue
and
a
vagabond
promiscuous
was
tabulated
among
the
seven
curses
of
london
organised
charity
was
the
readiest
alternative
again
obliging
counsellors
raised
their
conscientious
voices
organised
charity
was
wasteful
inelastic
unsympathetic
often
superfluous
the
preacher
added
a
warning
note
let
none
think
that
the
easy
donation
of
a
cheque
here
and
there
was
charity
it
was
frequently
vanity
it
was
often
a
cowardly
compromise
with
conscience
it
was
never
an
absolution
from
the
individual
responsibility
so
brotherly
love
continued
but
often
did
not
fructify
and
the
man
who
felt
that
he
had
the
true
samaritan
instinct
as
he
passed
by
on
the
one
side
of
the
suburban
road
looked
at
his
ragged
neighbour
lying
under
the
hedge
on
the
other
side
in
a
fit
which
might
be
epilepsy
but
might
equally
well
be
in
the
mouth
and
assured
himself
that
if
only
he
could
believe
the
case
to
be
genuine
there
was
nothing
on
earth
he
would
not
do
for
the
man
it
was
a
very
difficult
age
every
one
admitted
society
was
so
complex
there
was
evidence
of
the
generous
feeling
and
spasmodic
it
is
true
on
every
hand
the
poor
were
bravely
almost
blindly
good
to
their
neighbours
in
misfortune
the
were
lavish
or
had
been
until
a
few
years
previously
when
they
had
certified
proof
that
the
cases
were
deserving
if
a
magistrate
or
a
police
court
missionary
gave
publicity
to
a
pathetic
case
the
pathetic
case
might
be
sure
of
being
able
to
retire
on
a
comfortable
annuity
if
only
every
pathetic
case
could
have
been
induced
to
come
pathetically
into
the
clutches
of
a
sympathetic
police
court
cadi
instead
of
dying
quite
as
pathetically
in
a
one
of
the
most
pressing
problems
of
benevolence
might
have
been
satisfactorily
solved
the
order
of
st
martin
of
tours
was
one
of
the
attempts
to
reconcile
the
generous
yearnings
of
mankind
with
modern
conditions
its
field
of
action
had
no
definable
limit
and
whatever
a
man
wished
to
give
it
was
prepared
to
utilise
it
was
not
primarily
concerned
with
money
although
judged
by
the
guaranteed
resources
upon
which
it
could
call
if
necessary
it
would
rank
as
a
rich
society
it
imposed
no
subscription
and
made
no
outside
appeal
upon
its
books
against
the
name
of
every
member
there
was
entered
what
he
bound
himself
to
do
when
it
was
required
of
him
it
was
a
vast
and
comprehensive
list
so
varied
that
few
ever
genuinely
applied
for
the
services
of
the
order
without
their
needs
being
satisfied
the
city
man
willing
to
give
a
foolish
and
repentant
youth
another
chance
of
honest
work
the
sussex
farmer
anxious
to
prove
what
a
month
of
south
down
fare
and
channel
breezes
would
do
for
a
small
city
convalescent
the
prim
little
suburban
lady
much
too
timid
to
attempt
any
personal
contact
with
the
unknown
depths
of
sin
and
suffering
but
eager
to
send
her
choicest
flowers
and
most
perfect
fruit
to
any
slum
the
laundry
girl
who
had
been
through
the
fires
herself
offering
to
pal
up
to
any
other
girl
having
a
bit
of
rough
and
wants
to
keep
straight
without
a
lot
of
jaw
all
found
a
deeper
use
in
life
beneath
the
sign
of
st
divided
cloak
children
even
little
children
were
not
shut
out
they
could
play
with
other
lonely
little
children
and
renounce
some
toys
the
inconspicuous
young
man
standing
in
sir
john
hampden
library
he
was
in
a
cheap
boot
shop
but
he
gave
his
early
closing
day
to
serve
the
order
as
a
messenger
and
there
were
millionaires
who
gave
less
found
the
thing
he
searched
for
and
handed
to
sir
john
an
unsealed
envelope
i
accept
said
the
baronet
after
glancing
at
the
slip
it
contained
this
was
what
he
accepted
order
of
martin
of
tours
john
flak
paradise
buildings
paradise
street
drury
lane
street
accident
service
through
the
night
stone
great
queen
street
waltham
master
he
could
have
declined
and
his
membership
would
have
been
at
an
end
but
in
a
mission
of
personal
service
he
could
not
accept
and
appoint
a
substitute
the
order
was
modern
reasonable
unemotional
and
quite
prepared
to
take
humanity
as
it
was
it
did
not
seek
to
impose
the
ideal
christian
standard
logically
recognising
that
if
a
man
gave
he
possessed
a
system
of
christian
laws
a
cæsar
whom
he
was
likewise
bidden
to
obey
would
at
once
incarcerate
him
in
a
prison
for
having
no
visible
means
of
subsistence
and
if
he
persisted
in
his
unnatural
christian
conduct
in
a
lunatic
asylum
where
in
its
appointed
season
he
would
have
the
story
of
the
rich
ruler
read
for
his
edification
the
order
was
practical
and
very
nice
to
do
with
but
it
had
a
standard
and
as
a
protest
against
that
widespread
reliance
in
the
omnipotence
of
gold
that
marred
the
age
it
allowed
no
delegation
of
an
office
of
mercy
on
all
points
it
was
open
its
thin
medallion
symbolised
no
mysteries
or
secret
vows
nor
and
on
this
one
point
it
was
unbending
as
far
as
lay
in
the
power
of
the
order
should
any
virtue
find
place
beneath
its
saintly
ensign
a
few
years
before
paradise
street
with
that
marked
inappropriateness
that
may
be
traced
in
the
nomenclature
of
many
london
thoroughfares
had
been
the
foulest
poorest
noisomest
most
and
region
even
in
the
purlieus
of
drury
lane
it
was
not
markedly
criminal
it
was
merely
filthy
and
when
broke
out
in
central
london
it
was
generally
found
that
they
radiated
from
paradise
street
like
ripples
from
a
dead
dog
thrown
into
a
pond
presently
a
type
foundry
in
the
next
street
growing
backwards
because
it
was
impossible
to
expand
further
in
any
other
direction
pushed
down
the
flimsy
tenements
that
stood
between
and
reared
a
high
wall
pierced
with
windows
of
prismatic
glass
in
their
place
soon
public
authorities
seeing
that
the
heavens
did
not
fall
when
a
quarter
of
paradise
street
did
suddenly
and
unexpectedly
tore
down
another
quarter
as
though
they
had
received
a
maddened
impulse
and
paradise
street
had
been
a
cardboard
model
the
phoenix
that
appeared
on
this
site
was
a
block
of
workmen
dwellings
it
could
not
be
said
to
have
given
universal
satisfaction
the
municipal
authorities
who
devised
it
bickered
entertainingly
over
most
of
the
details
that
lay
between
the
foundations
and
the
the
primitive
dwellers
in
paradise
street
looked
askance
at
it
as
they
did
at
most
things
not
in
liquid
form
social
reformers
complained
that
it
drove
away
the
very
poor
and
brought
in
a
class
of
only
medium
poor
and
ordinary
people
noticed
that
in
place
of
the
nearest
approach
to
artistic
dirt
to
be
found
in
the
metropolis
some
one
had
substituted
uninteresting
squalor
hampden
dismissed
his
carriage
in
lincoln
inn
fields
and
walked
the
remainder
of
the
way
he
had
changed
into
a
dark
lounge
suit
before
he
left
but
in
spite
of
the
principle
he
had
so
positively
laid
down
he
had
not
stayed
to
dine
the
inevitable
morbid
little
group
marked
the
entrance
to
paradise
buildings
but
the
incident
was
already
three
hours
old
and
the
larger
public
interest
was
being
reserved
for
the
anticipated
funeral
a
slipshod
woman
opened
the
door
of
no
in
response
to
his
discreet
knock
he
stepped
into
a
small
hall
where
coal
was
stored
in
a
and
on
her
invitation
through
into
the
front
room
five
more
untidy
women
who
had
been
drinking
from
three
cups
got
up
as
he
entered
and
passed
out
eyeing
him
with
respectful
curiosity
as
they
went
and
each
dropping
a
word
of
friendly
leavetaking
to
the
slatternly
hostess
do
be
my
dear
see
you
later
emm
let
know
how
things
are
going
wo
you
you
remember
about
that
black
alpaker
body
well
so
long
mrs
flak
gord
bless
yer
sir
john
waited
until
the
hall
door
closed
behind
the
last
frowsy
woman
i
am
here
to
be
of
any
use
i
can
he
said
did
dr
stone
mention
that
some
one
would
come
yes
sir
thank
you
sir
she
replied
she
stood
in
the
middle
of
the
room
a
picture
of
domestic
incapacity
with
a
foolish
look
upon
her
rather
comely
features
the
room
was
not
bare
of
furniture
was
not
devoid
of
comforts
but
the
dirty
dishes
the
dirty
clothing
the
dirty
floor
told
the
plain
tale
i
do
not
know
any
particulars
of
the
case
yet
he
saw
at
once
that
he
would
have
to
take
the
lead
in
every
detail
did
the
doctor
speak
of
coming
again
or
leave
any
message
yes
sir
she
replied
readily
she
lifted
an
ornament
on
the
mantelpiece
and
gave
him
a
folded
sheet
of
paper
torn
from
a
that
had
been
placed
there
for
safety
he
had
the
clearest
impression
that
it
would
never
have
occurred
to
the
woman
to
give
it
to
him
unasked
to
rep
of
st
ran
the
pencilled
scrawl
shall
endeavour
to
look
in
even
as
he
took
out
his
watch
there
came
a
knock
at
the
door
an
active
step
in
the
hall
and
beneath
the
conventional
greeting
the
two
men
were
weighing
one
another
dr
stone
had
asked
the
order
to
send
a
man
of
who
could
exercise
authority
if
need
be
and
one
who
would
not
be
squeamish
in
his
surroundings
for
reasons
of
his
own
he
had
added
that
if
with
these
qualifications
he
combined
that
of
being
a
justice
of
the
peace
so
much
the
better
dr
stone
judged
that
he
had
the
man
before
him
hampden
saw
a
brisk
not
too
well
shaven
man
in
a
light
suit
with
a
straw
hat
and
a
serviceable
stick
in
his
hands
until
he
threw
them
on
the
table
there
was
kindness
and
decision
behind
his
alert
eyes
and
his
manner
was
that
of
a
benevolent
despot
marshalling
his
poor
patients
and
he
had
few
others
as
a
regiment
before
him
marching
them
right
and
left
in
companies
bringing
them
sharply
to
the
front
and
bidding
them
to
stand
there
and
do
nothing
until
they
were
told
you
have
been
into
the
other
room
yet
he
asked
no
well
he
stopped
with
his
hand
on
the
door
knob
turned
back
like
a
pointer
on
the
suspicion
of
a
trail
and
looked
keenly
at
the
woman
then
around
the
bestrewn
room
if
her
eyes
had
slid
the
least
betraying
glance
hampden
did
not
observe
it
but
the
doctor
without
a
word
strode
to
the
littered
couch
put
his
hand
behind
a
threadbare
cushion
and
drew
out
a
bottle
there
was
a
gluggling
ripple
for
a
few
seconds
and
the
contents
had
disappeared
down
the
sink
while
the
terebinthine
odour
of
cheap
gin
hung
across
the
room
not
here
mrs
flak
he
said
sharply
and
without
changing
her
expression
of
vacuous
the
woman
meekly
replied
no
sir
dr
stone
led
the
way
into
the
inner
room
and
closed
the
door
behind
them
a
man
asleep
insensible
or
dead
lay
on
the
bed
his
face
half
hidden
in
bandages
this
is
the
position
explained
the
doctor
speaking
very
rapidly
for
his
time
was
mapped
out
with
as
little
waste
as
there
is
to
be
found
between
the
squares
on
a
chess
board
this
man
went
out
of
here
a
few
hours
ago
and
walked
straight
into
an
empty
motor
that
was
going
round
this
way
that
how
they
all
put
it
he
walked
right
into
the
thing
why
he
was
a
sober
enough
man
an
attendant
of
some
kind
at
one
of
the
west
end
clubs
because
as
i
have
good
reason
to
suppose
he
was
thinking
absorbingly
of
something
else
well
they
carried
him
in
here
it
ought
to
have
been
the
hospital
of
course
but
it
was
at
his
own
doorstep
it
took
place
you
see
and
it
does
really
matter
because
morning
he
will
die
then
asked
hampden
in
a
whisper
interpreting
the
quick
gesture
oh
he
will
die
as
sure
as
his
head
is
a
cracked
between
midnight
and
dawn
i
should
say
but
before
the
end
i
look
confidently
for
an
interval
of
consciousness
or
rather
if
i
am
wrong
i
shall
have
kept
you
up
all
night
for
nothing
if
i
am
right
you
will
probably
hear
something
that
he
wants
to
say
very
much
whatever
was
in
his
mind
when
he
met
with
the
accident
that
is
my
conviction
there
has
already
been
an
indication
of
partial
expression
curiously
enough
i
have
had
two
exactly
similar
cases
and
this
is
going
just
the
same
way
in
one
it
was
a
sum
of
money
a
man
had
banked
under
another
name
to
keep
it
from
his
wife
and
for
his
children
in
the
second
it
was
a
blow
struck
in
a
scuffle
and
an
innocent
man
was
doing
penal
servitude
for
it
that
is
what
you
wished
to
have
some
one
here
for
chiefly
then
asked
hampden
everything
practically
you
see
the
kind
of
people
around
the
wife
is
a
fool
the
neighbours
are
the
class
of
maddening
dolts
who
leave
a
suicide
hanging
until
a
policeman
comes
to
cut
him
down
they
would
hold
an
orgie
in
the
next
room
in
excitement
the
women
fly
to
gin
as
instinctively
as
a
nun
flies
to
prayer
order
them
out
if
they
come
but
i
do
think
that
they
will
trouble
you
after
i
have
spoken
to
the
woman
as
i
go
if
there
is
anything
to
be
caught
it
will
have
to
be
on
the
hop
so
to
speak
it
may
be
a
confession
a
deposition
of
legal
value
or
only
a
request
one
can
not
guess
questioning
when
the
stage
is
reached
might
lead
to
something
it
largely
a
matter
of
luck
but
intelligence
may
have
an
innings
is
there
nothing
to
be
done
in
the
way
of
making
it
easier
for
him
dr
stone
made
a
face
expressive
of
their
helplessness
and
shrugged
his
shoulders
then
mentioned
a
few
simple
details
he
will
never
know
he
explained
even
when
he
seems
conscious
he
will
feel
no
pain
and
remember
nothing
of
the
accident
the
clock
will
be
mercifully
set
back
he
smiled
whimsically
forgive
me
if
it
never
strikes
he
turned
to
go
the
nearest
call
office
is
the
kiosk
in
aldwych
he
remarked
i
am
covent
garden
no
paper
being
visible
he
wrote
the
number
on
the
wall
after
as
a
general
thing
he
added
so
the
baronet
was
left
alone
with
the
still
figure
that
counterfeited
death
so
well
the
man
who
would
be
dead
before
the
dawn
he
stepped
quietly
to
the
bed
and
looked
down
on
him
the
lower
half
of
the
face
was
free
from
swathing
and
the
lean
throat
and
grizzled
beard
struck
sir
john
with
a
momentary
surprise
it
was
the
face
of
an
elderly
man
he
had
expected
to
find
one
not
more
than
as
the
companion
of
the
young
woman
in
the
other
room
there
was
a
single
chair
against
the
wall
and
he
sat
down
there
was
nothing
else
to
do
but
to
sit
and
wait
to
listen
to
the
sounds
of
voluminous
life
that
rose
from
the
street
beneath
the
careful
creaking
movements
in
the
room
beyond
from
the
shallow
wainscotting
near
the
bed
came
at
intervals
the
steady
ticking
of
a
it
was
nothing
as
every
one
knew
but
the
note
of
an
insect
calling
for
its
mate
but
it
thrilled
and
grew
large
in
the
stillness
of
the
chamber
ominously
a
low
tap
on
the
door
came
as
a
relief
he
found
the
woman
standing
there
is
there
anything
different
she
asked
hanging
on
to
the
door
i
kept
on
thinking
i
heard
noises
no
there
is
no
change
he
replied
will
you
come
in
she
shrank
back
at
the
suggestion
gord
us
no
she
cried
bad
enough
out
there
what
are
you
afraid
of
he
asked
kindly
she
had
no
words
for
it
did
not
enter
into
her
daily
life
but
sitting
there
alone
among
the
noises
real
and
imagined
she
had
reached
a
state
of
terror
there
is
nothing
at
all
dreadful
nothing
that
would
shock
you
he
said
referring
to
the
appearance
of
the
dying
man
you
are
his
wife
are
you
not
the
foolish
look
half
stubborn
half
vacuous
flickered
about
her
face
as
good
as
she
replied
it
like
this
i
see
he
had
no
desire
to
hear
the
recital
of
the
sordid
details
his
wife
in
a
wo
never
be
anywhere
else
and
i
been
with
him
these
five
years
an
honest
woman
to
him
all
the
time
she
said
bridling
somewhat
at
the
suggestion
of
reproach
no
one
got
no
better
right
to
the
things
i
sure
her
eloquence
was
stirred
not
so
much
to
defend
her
reputation
as
by
the
fear
that
some
one
might
step
in
to
claim
the
things
there
will
be
plenty
of
time
to
talk
about
that
when
when
it
is
necessary
he
said
has
he
no
relations
about
here
who
ought
to
be
told
nah
she
said
decisively
no
one
but
me
why
he
did
even
have
no
friends
no
pals
of
his
own
class
as
you
may
say
very
close
about
himself
he
was
all
he
thought
of
was
them
political
corkses
as
they
call
um
she
came
nearer
to
the
door
again
the
gossiping
passion
of
her
class
stronger
than
her
fear
now
that
the
earlier
restraint
of
his
presence
was
wearing
off
it
the
only
thing
we
ever
had
a
word
about
it
all
right
and
well
for
them
that
make
a
living
at
it
but
many
and
many
a
time
my
lost
a
day
two
and
three
times
a
week
to
sit
in
the
distingwidged
strangers
gallery
you
might
think
it
sir
but
he
was
hand
and
foot
with
some
of
the
biggest
men
there
are
he
was
indeed
hampden
was
looking
at
her
curiously
he
read
into
her
word
the
ceaseless
clatter
of
her
nagging
shameless
tongue
when
the
old
man
brought
home
a
few
shillings
less
than
he
was
wont
the
aftermath
of
sullen
silence
the
unprepared
meals
and
neglected
home
he
pictured
him
a
patient
old
man
and
pitied
him
and
now
she
took
pride
and
boasted
of
the
very
things
that
she
had
upbraided
him
with
vickers
he
knew
she
continued
complacently
and
drugget
he
shaken
hands
with
mr
strummery
the
prime
minister
more
than
onest
then
tubes
you
heard
speak
of
him
he
found
mr
tubes
a
very
pleasant
gentleman
oh
and
a
lot
more
i
ca
remember
hampden
disengaged
himself
from
further
conversation
with
a
single
formal
sentence
and
returned
to
his
vigil
there
he
was
secure
from
her
callous
chatter
he
saw
the
renewed
look
of
terror
start
into
her
eyes
when
a
board
behind
her
creaked
as
the
door
was
closing
he
heard
the
startled
shriek
but
her
squalid
avarice
cut
off
his
sympathies
he
sat
down
again
and
looked
round
at
the
already
familiar
objects
in
the
room
the
form
lying
on
the
bed
had
not
changed
a
fraction
of
its
rigid
outline
but
he
missed
something
somewhere
in
the
room
and
for
a
minute
he
could
not
identify
it
then
he
remembered
the
ticking
of
the
it
had
ceased
he
looked
at
his
watch
it
was
not
yet
nine
he
had
not
been
back
more
than
ten
minutes
when
the
subdued
tapping
it
was
rather
a
timid
scrape
as
though
she
feared
that
a
louder
summons
might
call
another
forth
was
repeated
i
do
see
that
it
no
good
my
staying
here
she
gasped
i
been
sitting
there
till
the
furniture
fair
began
to
move
towards
me
and
every
bloomin
rag
about
the
place
had
a
face
in
it
it
giving
me
the
fair
horrors
he
could
not
ignore
her
state
what
do
you
want
to
do
he
asked
i
want
to
go
out
for
a
bit
she
replied
licking
her
thin
feline
lips
you
do
know
what
it
like
i
want
to
hear
real
people
talk
and
not
see
things
move
i
come
back
soon
before
gord
i
will
yes
will
you
came
back
i
wo
may
it
strike
me
dead
if
i
touch
a
drop
i
go
straight
into
mrs
rugg
across
the
street
and
she
almost
what
you
might
call
a
teetotaler
the
man
you
call
your
husband
is
dying
in
there
and
he
may
need
your
help
at
any
minute
he
said
sternly
it
needed
no
gift
of
divination
to
prophesy
that
if
the
woman
once
left
the
place
she
would
be
hopelessly
drunk
before
an
hour
had
passed
do
sit
down
doing
nothing
but
imagining
things
he
continued
make
yourself
some
tea
and
then
when
one
of
your
friends
comes
round
to
see
you
you
can
let
her
stay
but
only
one
mind
he
saw
the
more
sullen
of
her
looks
settle
darkly
about
her
face
as
he
closed
the
door
he
waited
to
hear
the
sound
of
the
kettle
being
moved
the
clinking
but
they
never
came
an
unnatural
uncreaking
silence
reigned
instead
he
opened
the
door
quietly
and
looked
out
that
room
was
empty
and
as
he
stood
there
a
current
of
cooler
air
fell
across
his
cheek
half
a
dozen
steps
brought
him
to
the
entrance
to
the
little
hall
the
only
other
room
there
was
it
also
was
empty
and
the
front
door
stood
widely
open
there
was
only
one
possible
inference
mrs
flak
had
fled
sir
john
had
confessed
to
possessing
nerves
and
to
few
men
the
situation
would
have
been
an
inviting
one
still
there
was
only
one
possible
thing
to
do
and
he
closed
the
door
again
noticing
as
he
did
so
that
the
action
locked
it
as
he
stood
there
a
moment
before
returning
to
the
bedroom
and
its
tranquil
occupant
lying
in
his
rigid
unbreathing
sleep
a
slight
but
continuous
sound
caught
his
ear
it
was
the
most
closely
comparable
to
attempt
to
define
it
with
the
whirring
of
a
clock
as
the
flying
pinion
is
released
before
it
strikes
or
it
might
be
that
the
doctor
simile
prompted
the
comparison
it
was
not
loud
but
the
room
beyond
seemed
very
very
still
it
was
not
a
time
to
temporise
with
the
emotions
hampden
stepped
into
the
next
room
and
stood
listening
he
judged
nay
he
was
sure
that
the
sound
came
from
the
bedroom
but
it
was
not
repeated
instead
something
very
different
happened
something
that
was
either
terrifying
or
natural
according
to
the
conditions
that
provoked
it
quite
without
warning
there
came
a
voice
from
the
next
room
a
full
level
healthy
voice
even
strong
and
speaking
in
the
ordinary
manner
of
conversation
will
you
please
tell
mr
tubes
that
i
am
waiting
here
to
see
him
chapter
xi
man
between
two
masters
there
was
something
in
the
situation
that
was
more
than
gruesome
something
that
was
peculiarly
unnerving
in
his
anticipation
of
this
moment
as
he
had
sat
almost
by
the
bedside
hampden
had
conjectured
that
the
dying
man
would
perhaps
lift
a
hand
or
move
his
head
uneasily
with
the
first
instinct
of
returning
consciousness
a
sigh
a
groan
might
escape
him
incoherent
words
follow
then
broken
but
rational
expressions
of
his
suffering
and
entreaties
that
something
might
be
done
to
ease
the
pain
or
perhaps
after
realising
his
position
he
would
nerve
himself
to
betray
no
unmanly
weakness
and
in
the
words
of
the
significant
old
phrase
turning
his
face
to
the
wall
endure
in
stoical
silence
to
the
end
it
would
be
painful
perhaps
acutely
distressing
but
it
would
not
be
unnatural
there
had
been
no
groan
no
sigh
or
broken
words
no
indication
of
weakness
or
suffering
behind
that
door
nothing
but
the
curious
sound
that
had
gone
before
the
voice
and
that
voice
it
was
as
full
and
strong
as
vibrant
and
as
ordinary
as
his
own
could
ever
be
standing
in
the
middle
of
the
sir
john
could
not
deceive
himself
it
came
from
the
other
room
where
a
minute
before
he
had
left
the
dying
yes
the
almost
dead
man
lying
with
stark
outline
on
the
bed
there
was
no
alternative
it
was
from
those
pallid
lips
that
the
words
had
come
it
was
by
that
still
inanimate
man
that
they
were
spoken
the
suddenness
of
the
whole
incident
was
shocking
in
itself
but
that
was
not
all
the
mere
contrast
to
what
he
had
looked
for
was
disconcerting
but
there
was
something
more
the
curious
unexpected
nature
of
the
request
if
request
it
was
was
not
without
its
element
of
mystery
but
above
and
beyond
all
else
was
the
thought
the
thought
that
for
a
dreadful
moment
held
his
heart
and
soul
in
icy
bonds
what
sight
when
he
returned
to
the
inner
room
as
return
at
once
he
must
what
gruesome
sight
would
meet
his
eyes
what
phantoms
his
misgivings
raised
every
man
may
conjecture
for
himself
follow
then
another
step
in
imagination
and
having
given
a
somewhat
free
and
ghastly
fancy
rein
push
the
chamber
door
cautiously
and
inch
by
inch
or
fling
it
boldly
open
as
you
will
then
pause
upon
the
threshold
as
hampden
did
in
sharp
surprise
nothing
was
altered
no
single
detail
had
undergone
the
slightest
change
on
the
bed
rigid
and
very
sharp
beneath
the
single
unclean
sheet
lay
the
body
of
the
mangled
man
not
a
fold
of
his
wrapping
differed
from
its
former
line
it
did
not
seem
possible
that
a
breath
had
stirred
him
had
the
voice
been
a
trick
of
the
imagination
hampden
knew
as
far
as
mortal
man
can
be
sure
of
any
mortal
sense
that
the
voice
had
been
as
real
as
his
life
itself
then
it
occurred
to
him
in
a
flash
here
was
the
stage
of
of
which
dr
stone
had
spoken
of
his
pain
the
accident
where
he
at
that
moment
lay
and
all
his
real
surroundings
the
sufferer
knew
nothing
and
never
would
know
but
out
of
the
shock
and
shattering
some
of
the
delicate
machinery
of
the
brain
still
kept
its
balance
and
would
continue
to
exercise
its
functions
to
the
end
it
was
an
ordeal
but
it
had
to
be
done
it
was
the
purpose
for
which
he
had
been
summoned
sir
john
moved
to
the
bedside
nerved
himself
to
watch
the
ashen
face
and
said
slowly
and
distinctly
mr
tubes
is
not
here
do
you
wish
to
see
him
there
was
just
a
perceptible
pause
and
then
the
bloodless
lips
replied
but
not
the
faintest
tremor
of
a
movement
stirred
the
body
otherwise
from
head
to
foot
and
in
the
chilling
absence
of
expression
the
simile
occurred
to
hampden
of
bubbles
rising
from
some
unseen
working
to
the
surface
of
an
inky
pool
i
have
come
on
purpose
let
him
be
told
that
it
is
most
important
hampden
had
to
feel
his
way
the
woman
had
mentioned
that
flak
was
at
least
on
terms
of
acquaintanceship
with
mr
tubes
the
doctor
had
surmised
that
the
man
had
something
he
must
say
before
he
died
but
was
this
the
one
true
line
or
a
mere
vagary
of
the
state
a
twist
in
the
tortuous
labyrinth
that
would
lead
to
nothing
he
is
not
here
at
present
he
said
if
you
will
tell
me
what
you
wish
to
say
i
will
write
it
down
so
that
it
can
not
fail
to
reach
him
no
i
can
not
tell
any
one
else
i
must
see
him
mr
tubes
is
a
very
busy
man
you
know
that
he
is
the
home
secretary
is
it
of
sufficient
importance
to
telegraph
for
him
this
time
the
answer
followed
on
his
last
word
with
startling
rapidity
until
the
last
phase
that
was
the
only
variation
in
the
delivery
of
the
sentences
that
sometimes
there
was
a
pause
as
though
the
working
of
the
mind
had
to
make
a
revolution
before
it
reached
the
point
of
the
mental
clutch
at
others
it
dropped
into
its
gear
at
once
it
is
important
enough
to
send
a
coach
and
four
for
him
was
the
reply
hampden
might
not
be
convinced
of
this
but
he
was
satisfied
of
one
thing
the
coherence
of
idea
was
being
regularly
maintained
how
long
would
it
last
it
occurred
to
him
to
put
the
question
i
shall
have
to
go
out
either
to
send
the
telegram
myself
or
to
find
some
one
who
will
take
it
he
explained
until
mr
tubes
comes
or
sends
his
reply
will
you
it
was
rather
eerie
to
be
holding
conversation
with
the
fragment
of
a
man
brain
with
the
man
himself
for
all
practical
purposes
eliminated
but
he
seemed
to
have
arrived
at
a
practical
understanding
with
the
centre
of
i
will
remain
was
the
unhesitating
reply
and
hampden
felt
assured
that
the
line
would
not
be
lost
he
had
not
definitely
settled
in
his
mind
what
to
do
when
he
opened
the
door
leading
on
to
the
common
stairs
a
small
child
who
had
been
loitering
outside
in
a
crouching
position
staggered
back
in
momentary
alarm
at
his
sudden
appearance
it
was
a
ragged
girl
perhaps
ten
or
twelve
years
old
with
cruelly
unwieldy
boots
upon
her
stockingless
feet
matted
hair
and
a
precocious
face
full
of
unchildish
knowledge
the
inference
that
she
had
been
applying
either
an
eye
or
an
ear
to
the
keyhole
was
overwhelming
her
fear
it
was
only
the
slum
child
instinct
of
flight
died
out
when
she
saw
the
gentleman
toffs
so
ran
her
experience
do
not
hit
you
for
nothing
ee
in
there
yet
ai
ee
she
whispered
coming
back
boldly
and
looking
up
confidentially
to
his
face
i
yer
talking
but
i
could
tell
what
yer
said
long
think
last
sir
john
looked
down
at
the
child
the
child
who
had
never
been
young
in
shuddering
pity
it
was
me
what
picked
up
but
they
would
let
me
go
in
she
continued
as
though
the
fact
gave
her
a
standing
in
the
case
did
yer
see
it
in
there
she
looked
proudly
at
her
right
hand
with
horrid
significance
come
in
here
he
said
after
considering
can
you
run
an
errand
her
face
reflected
gloating
eagerness
as
she
entered
her
attitude
had
just
a
tinge
of
pleasurable
awe
he
did
not
permit
her
to
go
further
than
the
hall
is
it
to
do
with
she
asked
keenly
yehs
it
is
to
go
to
the
post
office
in
fleet
street
he
explained
you
must
go
as
fast
as
ever
you
can
i
can
go
anywhere
as
well
as
any
boy
and
as
fast
if
i
take
my
boots
off
when
that
there
italian
knifed
her
man
him
what
took
up
with
shiny
sal
in
the
lane
a
year
ago
it
was
me
what
fetched
the
police
he
left
her
standing
there
her
face
to
the
chink
of
the
door
before
he
had
turned
away
and
went
into
the
next
room
to
write
the
message
he
desired
to
make
it
neither
too
insistent
nor
too
immaterial
john
flak
of
paradise
buildings
paradise
street
drury
lane
has
met
with
fatal
accident
and
earnestly
desires
to
see
you
on
important
business
was
the
form
it
took
he
had
sufficient
stamps
in
his
pocket
for
the
payment
and
to
these
he
added
another
for
a
receipt
you
can
read
he
asked
returning
to
her
yehs
she
replied
with
her
curious
accent
of
lofty
scorn
at
so
ingenuous
a
question
i
read
all
the
murders
and
sewercides
to
blind
mike
every
sunday
morning
well
go
as
fast
as
you
can
to
the
post
office
in
fleet
street
and
give
them
this
paper
where
you
see
written
up
then
wait
for
another
piece
of
paper
which
they
will
give
you
and
bring
it
back
to
me
here
is
sixpence
for
you
now
and
you
shall
have
another
shilling
when
you
come
back
he
was
making
it
more
profitable
for
her
to
be
honest
than
to
be
dishonest
which
is
perhaps
the
safest
way
in
an
emergency
it
was
nearly
ten
when
he
looked
at
his
watch
on
her
departure
it
was
not
ten
minutes
past
when
she
returned
she
was
panting
but
exultant
and
watched
his
face
for
commendation
as
she
gave
him
the
receipt
as
a
probationary
imp
might
watch
the
face
of
the
prince
of
darkness
on
bringing
in
his
first
human
soul
one
boot
she
had
dropped
in
her
wild
career
but
so
far
from
stopping
to
look
for
it
she
had
thrown
away
the
other
then
as
useless
leaving
the
seated
on
the
coal
to
thrill
delightfully
at
every
unknown
sound
hampden
returned
to
the
bedside
much
of
the
first
the
absolutely
cold
horror
of
the
situation
was
gone
he
judged
it
better
not
to
allow
too
long
an
interval
of
silence
in
which
that
dim
consciousness
might
slip
back
into
the
outer
space
of
trackless
darkness
now
that
he
knew
what
to
expect
it
was
not
very
unlike
speaking
to
one
who
slept
and
held
converse
in
his
sleep
i
have
sent
for
mr
tubes
but
making
due
allowance
he
can
scarcely
get
here
in
less
than
an
hour
he
said
if
in
the
meantime
there
is
anything
that
you
wish
to
tell
me
to
make
doubly
sure
it
will
be
received
as
a
most
sacred
confidence
there
was
a
longer
pause
than
any
before
so
long
that
the
watcher
by
the
bedside
was
preparing
to
speak
again
then
the
lips
slowly
opened
and
the
same
full
substantial
voice
made
reply
i
will
wait
but
he
must
be
quick
quick
the
words
seemed
to
disclose
a
fear
but
there
was
no
outward
sign
of
failing
power
hampden
ventured
on
another
point
are
you
in
pain
he
asked
the
reply
came
more
quickly
this
time
and
perhaps
because
he
was
looking
for
some
such
indication
the
listener
fancied
that
he
caught
the
faintest
stumbling
a
little
blurring
of
the
outline
here
and
there
no
i
am
in
no
pain
but
i
have
a
terrible
anxiety
that
weighs
me
down
there
was
nothing
to
be
gained
by
further
questioning
sir
john
returned
to
the
other
room
the
fire
was
low
and
the
grate
choked
with
ashes
he
had
begun
to
replenish
it
when
a
curious
sound
startled
him
he
only
heard
it
between
the
raspings
of
the
poker
as
he
raked
the
ashes
out
but
it
was
not
to
be
mistaken
it
was
the
sharp
dry
whirring
that
had
been
the
first
indication
of
life
and
speech
beyond
the
bedroom
door
more
than
an
hour
before
a
board
creaked
behind
him
and
he
turned
with
an
exclamation
to
see
the
dreadful
child
standing
in
the
middle
of
the
room
barefooted
she
had
slipped
noiselessly
in
from
the
hall
at
the
first
tremor
of
that
unusual
sound
and
now
with
her
dilated
eyes
fixed
fearfully
on
the
door
her
shrinking
form
bent
forward
she
slowly
crept
nearer
step
by
step
her
face
quivered
with
terror
her
whole
body
shook
but
she
went
on
as
surely
as
though
a
magnet
drew
her
what
are
you
doing
cried
hampden
sharply
why
did
you
not
stay
where
i
told
you
she
turned
her
face
but
not
her
eyes
towards
him
yer
heard
it
did
yer
she
whispered
ai
that
what
they
call
the
what
comes
he
took
her
by
the
shoulder
and
swung
her
impatiently
round
go
back
you
imp
he
commanded
back
and
stay
there
or
you
shall
go
out
she
crept
back
looking
fearfully
over
her
shoulder
all
the
way
something
else
was
happening
to
engage
hampden
attention
in
the
next
room
the
man
was
speaking
speaking
spontaneously
as
he
had
done
once
before
but
beyond
all
doubt
the
voice
was
weaker
now
the
momentary
interruption
of
the
child
presence
had
drowned
the
first
part
of
the
sentence
but
hampden
caught
a
word
that
strung
up
every
faculty
he
possessed
league
league
will
then
suddenly
issue
a
notice
to
all
its
members
putting
an
embargo
a
boycott
if
you
will
on
the
voice
trailed
off
and
although
he
sprang
to
the
door
sir
john
could
not
distinguish
another
word
but
that
fragment
alone
was
sufficiently
startling
to
the
president
of
the
unity
league
it
could
only
have
one
meaning
for
it
was
true
some
how
much
of
their
plan
lay
open
and
to
how
many
was
it
known
the
terrible
anxiety
of
this
poor
battered
wreck
unconsciously
loyal
to
his
class
in
death
to
give
the
warning
before
he
passed
away
seemed
to
indicate
that
nothing
but
the
frayed
thread
of
one
existence
stood
in
the
league
path
yet
was
there
anything
to
be
done
that
was
hampden
first
thought
there
was
plainly
one
thing
to
learn
if
possible
before
mr
tubes
arrival
how
much
was
known
nothing
was
changed
only
the
ticked
again
he
leaned
over
the
bed
in
his
eagerness
and
stilling
the
throbbing
excitement
of
his
blood
tried
to
speak
in
a
tone
of
commonplace
indifference
yes
continue
there
was
no
response
repeat
the
sentence
he
commanded
concentrating
his
voice
in
his
desperation
and
endeavouring
by
mere
force
of
will
to
impose
its
authority
on
the
indefinite
consciousness
just
as
well
might
he
have
commanded
the
man
to
get
up
and
walk
had
that
last
elusive
thread
that
held
him
to
mortality
been
broken
hampden
bent
still
lower
the
pallid
face
was
no
more
pallid
than
before
but
before
it
could
scarcely
have
been
more
the
acutest
test
could
not
have
found
a
trace
of
breath
he
put
together
the
gradual
failing
of
the
voice
that
little
more
than
an
hour
ago
had
been
as
full
and
vigorous
as
his
own
the
unfinished
sentence
the
silence
suddenly
he
straightened
himself
by
the
bedside
with
a
sense
of
guilt
that
struck
him
like
a
blow
what
was
he
thinking
hoping
who
was
he
sir
john
hampden
president
of
the
unity
league
not
in
that
room
the
man
who
watched
by
the
bedside
stood
there
even
as
the
humblest
servant
of
the
order
of
martin
pledged
while
in
that
service
to
succour
in
trouble
sorrow
need
sickness
or
any
other
adversity
it
did
not
occur
to
him
to
debate
the
point
his
way
seemed
very
straight
and
clear
his
plain
duty
to
the
dying
man
was
to
try
by
every
means
in
his
power
to
carry
out
his
one
overwhelming
desire
its
successful
accomplishment
might
aim
a
more
formidable
blow
at
his
own
ambition
than
almost
anything
else
that
could
happen
it
could
not
ward
off
the
attack
upon
which
the
league
was
now
concentrating
nothing
could
do
that
but
an
intimate
knowledge
of
the
details
of
that
scheme
of
retaliation
might
act
in
a
hundred
adverse
ways
hampden
did
not
stop
to
consider
what
might
happen
on
the
one
side
and
on
the
other
a
thousand
years
of
argument
and
sophistries
could
not
alter
the
one
great
fact
of
his
present
duty
he
had
a
very
simple
conscience
and
he
followed
it
if
he
could
have
speeded
mr
tubes
arrival
he
would
have
done
so
now
he
went
into
the
hall
to
listen
the
street
child
was
still
there
sitting
on
the
coal
as
and
wakefully
alert
as
ever
he
had
forgotten
her
come
little
imp
he
said
kindly
i
ought
to
have
packed
you
off
long
ago
it
was
in
point
of
fact
nearly
eleven
ai
doin
no
aharm
to
the
coal
she
muttered
that
not
the
question
you
ought
to
have
been
at
home
and
in
bed
by
this
time
of
night
she
looked
up
at
him
sharply
with
a
suspicion
that
such
innocence
in
a
man
could
not
be
unassumed
ai
got
no
bed
she
said
contemptuously
ai
got
no
a
sentence
rang
through
his
mind
the
birds
of
the
air
have
nests
where
do
you
sleep
he
asked
anywhere
she
replied
and
how
do
you
live
anyhow
the
lowest
depths
of
human
poverty
had
not
been
abolished
by
act
of
parliament
after
all
a
knock
at
the
door
interrupted
the
reflection
the
child
had
already
heard
the
step
and
sought
to
efface
herself
in
the
darkest
corner
hampden
had
not
noticed
the
significance
of
the
knock
he
opened
the
door
prepared
to
admit
the
home
secretary
so
thoroughly
had
he
dissociated
his
own
personality
from
the
issue
that
he
felt
the
keenest
interest
that
the
man
should
arrive
before
it
was
too
late
he
opened
the
door
to
admit
him
and
experienced
an
actual
pang
of
disappointment
when
he
saw
who
stood
outside
he
had
sent
a
telegram
instead
whatever
the
telegram
said
did
not
matter
very
much
hampden
instinctively
guessed
that
he
was
not
coming
then
was
not
on
his
way
anything
less
than
that
would
be
too
late
he
took
the
orange
envelope
and
opened
it
beneath
the
flaring
gas
that
piped
and
whistled
at
the
stairhead
there
is
no
reply
he
said
quietly
folding
the
paper
slowly
and
putting
it
away
in
his
were
it
not
that
the
gain
to
hampden
of
the
league
was
so
immense
one
might
have
thought
to
see
him
at
that
moment
that
he
felt
ashamed
of
something
in
life
members
of
parliament
had
every
department
of
the
postal
system
freely
at
their
service
the
statement
may
not
be
out
of
place
for
this
was
what
the
telegram
contained
deeply
regret
to
hear
of
comrade
flak
accident
and
will
have
it
fully
enquired
into
was
it
while
he
was
engaged
at
work
can
not
however
recall
any
business
upon
which
he
could
wish
to
see
me
probably
a
mental
hallucination
caused
by
shock
have
been
terribly
busy
all
day
and
am
engaged
at
this
moment
with
important
state
papers
which
be
finished
before
i
go
to
bed
if
it
is
thought
desirable
i
will
on
receiving
another
wire
come
first
thing
in
the
morning
but
before
deciding
to
take
this
course
i
beg
you
to
consider
incessant
calls
made
on
my
time
let
everything
possible
be
done
for
the
poor
fellow
james
tubes
the
burden
of
failure
pressed
on
hampden
as
he
walked
slowly
to
the
bedroom
in
that
environment
of
death
his
own
gain
did
not
touch
him
at
all
so
completely
had
he
succeeded
in
eliminating
for
the
time
every
consideration
except
an
almost
fanatical
sense
of
duty
to
the
articles
of
the
order
it
would
be
better
he
felt
if
the
shadowy
consciousness
that
hovered
around
the
bed
could
have
sunk
finally
into
its
eternal
sleep
without
suffering
the
pang
of
being
recalled
only
to
hear
but
something
in
the
atmosphere
of
the
room
a
brooding
tension
of
expectancy
that
seemed
to
quicken
in
the
silence
warned
him
that
this
was
not
to
be
a
reply
has
been
received
from
mr
tubes
in
answer
to
our
telegram
he
is
here
there
was
no
delay
this
time
there
was
an
intense
eagerness
that
for
a
brief
minute
overcame
the
growing
weakness
no
he
can
not
come
he
regrets
but
he
is
engaged
on
matters
of
national
importance
silence
painful
silence
in
it
hampden
seemed
to
share
the
cruel
frustration
of
so
great
a
hope
deferred
there
is
this
he
continued
more
for
the
sake
of
making
any
suggestion
than
from
a
belief
in
its
practicability
i
might
go
and
compel
him
to
come
if
he
understood
the
urgency
it
is
too
late
a
little
time
ago
there
was
a
thin
white
mist
now
it
is
a
solid
wall
of
dense
rolling
fog
it
is
nearer
relentless
unevadable
i
can
still
write
down
what
you
have
to
say
consider
it
is
the
only
hope
i
can
not
judge
i
had
a
settled
conviction
that
no
other
ear
stay
quick
there
are
the
notes
incomplete
but
they
will
put
him
on
the
track
swear
swear
that
you
will
place
them
in
his
hand
unread
i
swear
to
do
as
you
ask
me
go
on
quickly
now
do
not
do
not
let
do
not
wait
yes
yes
but
the
notes
where
are
they
how
am
i
to
know
them
the
voice
was
growing
very
thin
and
faltering
weaker
with
every
word
the
disappointment
had
sapped
all
its
failing
strength
at
a
single
blow
the
notes
yes
you
will
explain
the
black
wall
how
it
towers
he
was
whispering
inaudibly
hampden
leaned
over
the
dying
man
in
a
final
effort
flak
he
cried
the
notes
on
the
unity
league
where
are
they
speak
the
envelope
he
caught
a
breath
of
sound
coat
lining
must
twenty
minutes
later
sir
john
picked
up
his
motor
brougham
in
new
oxford
street
he
had
telephoned
immediately
on
leaving
paradise
buildings
for
it
to
start
out
at
once
and
wait
for
him
near
mudie
corner
in
paradise
street
he
had
seen
a
bacchanalian
group
surrounding
mrs
flak
high
priestess
who
chanted
a
song
in
praise
of
home
and
the
domestic
virtues
it
was
at
this
point
that
he
missed
the
from
his
side
a
wind
was
carrying
the
midnight
boom
of
the
great
clock
at
westminster
as
far
as
kilburn
when
he
turned
out
of
the
high
road
and
the
little
clocks
around
had
taken
up
the
chorus
like
small
dogs
envious
of
the
baying
of
a
hound
as
he
stopped
before
the
home
secretary
house
there
was
a
light
still
burning
in
a
room
on
the
ground
floor
and
it
was
mr
tubes
himself
who
came
to
the
door
i
have
to
place
in
your
hands
an
envelope
of
papers
entrusted
to
me
by
a
man
called
flak
who
died
in
paradise
street
an
hour
ago
said
hampden
and
with
the
act
he
brought
his
night
of
duty
as
a
faithful
servant
of
his
order
to
an
end
oh
that
you
said
mr
tubes
peering
out
into
the
darkness
i
had
a
wire
about
it
so
the
poor
man
is
dead
yes
replied
hampden
a
shade
drily
the
poor
man
is
dead
mr
tubes
fancied
that
he
saw
the
lamps
of
a
cab
beyond
his
garden
gate
and
he
wondered
whether
he
was
being
expected
to
offer
to
pay
the
fare
well
it
very
good
of
you
to
take
the
trouble
though
between
ourselves
i
hardly
imagine
that
the
papers
are
likely
to
be
of
any
importance
he
remarked
now
may
i
ask
who
i
am
indebted
to
hampden
had
already
turned
to
go
he
recognised
that
in
the
strife
which
he
was
about
to
precipitate
the
man
who
stood
there
would
be
his
natural
antagonist
and
he
regretted
that
he
could
not
find
it
in
his
nature
to
like
him
any
better
than
he
did
what
i
have
done
i
have
done
as
a
servant
of
the
order
of
st
martin
he
replied
what
i
am
about
to
do
he
added
i
shall
do
as
sir
john
hampden
and
leaving
mr
tubes
standing
on
the
doorstep
in
vast
surprise
the
electric
carriage
turned
its
to
the
south
again
chapter
xii
by
telescribe
what
sir
john
hampden
was
about
to
do
he
had
decided
in
the
course
of
the
outward
journey
there
was
nothing
in
his
actions
past
or
prospective
that
struck
him
as
illogical
he
would
have
said
indeed
that
they
were
the
only
possible
outcome
of
the
circumstance
for
the
last
four
hours
as
the
nameless
emissary
of
the
order
to
whose
discipline
he
bound
himself
he
had
merged
every
other
feeling
in
his
duty
to
the
dying
man
and
in
the
fulfilment
of
a
charge
that
was
over
now
as
the
president
of
the
unity
league
he
was
on
his
way
to
try
by
every
means
in
his
power
to
minimise
the
effect
of
what
he
had
done
to
anticipate
and
counteract
the
value
of
the
warning
he
had
so
scrupulously
conveyed
it
was
a
fantastic
predicament
he
had
sat
for
perhaps
half
an
hour
with
the
unsealed
envelope
in
his
pocket
and
no
eye
had
been
upon
him
he
had
declared
passionately
year
after
year
that
class
and
class
were
now
at
war
that
the
time
for
courteous
retaliation
was
long
since
past
that
social
martial
law
had
been
proclaimed
yet
as
he
drove
back
to
trafalgar
chambers
he
would
have
given
a
considerable
sum
of
money
the
league
being
not
ill
provided
say
fifty
thousand
pounds
to
know
the
extent
of
those
notes
when
he
reached
the
offices
it
was
almost
twelve
salt
would
be
flying
northward
as
fast
as
steam
could
take
him
and
for
the
next
two
hours
at
least
cut
off
from
the
possibility
of
any
communication
the
burden
of
decision
lay
on
hampden
alone
he
had
already
made
it
within
an
hour
he
would
have
pledged
the
league
to
a
line
of
policy
from
which
there
was
no
retreat
before
another
day
had
passed
the
government
could
recall
the
little
band
of
secret
service
agents
and
consign
their
reports
to
the
wastepaper
basket
every
one
would
know
everything
everything
he
smiled
until
the
remembrance
of
that
cheap
frayed
envelope
in
mr
tubes
possession
drove
the
smile
away
next
to
his
own
office
stood
the
instrument
room
here
behind
double
doors
that
deadened
every
sound
were
ranged
the
telephones
the
tape
machines
the
installation
and
that
most
modern
development
of
wireless
telegraphy
which
had
come
just
in
time
to
save
the
postal
system
from
chronic
congestion
the
telescribe
hampden
had
not
appeared
to
move
hurriedly
but
it
was
just
seventeen
seconds
after
he
had
sent
his
brougham
roving
eastward
that
he
stood
before
the
telephone
st
paul
please
there
was
a
sound
as
of
rushing
water
and
crackling
underwood
then
the
wire
seemed
to
clear
itself
like
a
swimmer
rising
from
the
sea
and
a
quiet
voice
was
whispering
in
his
ear
yes
i
lidiat
i
am
at
trafalgar
chambers
said
hampden
after
giving
his
name
i
want
you
to
drop
you
are
on
and
come
here
if
my
motor
is
not
waiting
for
you
at
the
corner
of
chancery
lane
you
will
meet
it
along
the
strand
at
the
other
end
of
the
wire
lidiat
the
man
who
possessed
the
sixth
code
typewriter
looked
rather
blankly
at
his
pipe
at
the
little
silver
carriage
clock
ticking
on
the
mantelpiece
at
the
fluted
coffee
set
and
at
his
crowded
desk
then
concluding
that
if
the
president
of
the
unity
league
sent
a
message
of
that
kind
after
midnight
and
immediately
rang
off
again
he
must
have
a
good
reason
for
it
he
locked
up
his
room
as
it
stood
took
up
a
few
articles
promiscuously
from
the
rack
in
the
hall
and
walked
out
under
the
antique
archway
into
fleet
street
in
the
meantime
the
exchange
was
being
urged
to
make
another
attempt
to
get
on
with
vincent
this
time
with
success
mr
salt
is
not
i
repeat
sir
an
indignant
voice
was
protesting
he
is
out
of
town
yes
yes
dobson
i
know
replied
st
james
i
am
sir
john
hampden
what
train
did
your
master
go
by
beg
pardon
sir
apologised
vincent
did
recognise
your
voice
at
first
sir
john
the
wires
here
is
he
went
by
the
from
the
great
central
and
told
me
to
meet
the
midland
morning
he
did
actually
go
by
the
train
i
him
the
despatch
case
through
the
carriage
window
not
five
minutes
before
the
whistle
went
he
was
sitting
with
his
thank
you
dobson
that
all
i
wanted
to
know
sorry
if
you
had
to
get
up
good
night
and
sir
john
cut
off
a
volume
of
amiable
verbosity
as
he
heard
the
bell
of
his
launceston
ring
in
the
street
below
fellow
watching
your
place
said
lidiat
jerking
his
head
in
the
direction
of
a
doorway
nearly
opposite
as
hampden
admitted
him
had
he
himself
been
the
object
of
the
watcher
attention
it
would
have
been
less
remarkable
for
had
not
the
time
and
the
place
been
london
after
midnight
lidiat
appearance
must
have
been
pronounced
bizarre
reasonable
enough
on
all
other
points
he
had
a
fixed
conviction
that
it
was
impossible
for
him
to
work
after
twelve
at
night
unless
he
wore
a
red
silk
skull
cap
flannels
and
yellow
moorish
slippers
into
this
æsthetic
costume
he
had
changed
half
an
hour
before
hampden
rang
him
up
and
in
it
with
the
addition
of
a
very
short
overcoat
and
a
silk
hat
that
displayed
an
inch
of
red
beneath
the
brim
he
now
stepped
from
the
brougham
a
large
man
perfectly
bald
and
still
clinging
to
his
pipe
hampden
laughed
contemptuously
as
he
glanced
across
the
street
they
have
put
on
half
a
dozen
private
enquiry
men
lately
he
explained
they
are
used
to
divorce
and
their
sole
idea
of
the
case
seems
to
be
summed
up
in
the
one
stock
phrase
the
house
possibly
they
expect
to
see
us
through
the
windows
making
bombs
why
do
they
watch
paris
instead
egyptian
three
per
cents
have
gone
up
francs
in
the
last
fortnight
all
from
there
and
for
no
obvious
reason
lidiat
nodded
weightily
we
stopped
too
much
comment
he
said
lift
off
there
are
only
two
short
flights
apologised
hampden
yes
i
saw
that
even
the
financial
papers
dismissed
it
as
a
piper
rise
here
we
are
they
had
not
lingered
as
they
talked
although
the
journalist
ranked
physical
haste
and
bodily
exertion
as
typified
by
flights
of
stairs
among
the
forbidden
things
of
life
hampden
had
brought
him
to
the
instrument
room
in
view
of
what
he
was
asking
of
lidiat
some
explanation
was
necessary
but
he
put
it
into
the
narrowest
possible
form
it
was
framed
not
on
persuasiveness
but
necessity
salt
is
away
something
has
happened
and
we
have
to
move
a
week
before
we
had
calculated
lidiat
nodded
he
accepted
the
necessity
as
proved
explanation
would
have
taken
time
his
training
and
occupation
made
him
chary
of
encouraging
two
words
when
one
would
do
between
midnight
and
the
hour
when
the
newspapers
are
closed
up
and
the
rotaries
begin
to
move
i
should
like
continued
hampden
in
issue
of
every
morning
paper
a
leader
two
items
of
news
one
home
one
foreign
and
a
single
column
advertisement
set
in
the
middle
of
a
full
white
page
lidiat
had
taken
off
his
hat
and
overcoat
and
placed
them
neatly
on
a
chair
it
occurred
to
him
as
a
fair
omen
that
providence
had
dealt
kindly
with
him
in
not
giving
him
any
opportunity
of
changing
his
clothes
he
now
took
out
his
watch
and
hung
it
on
a
projecting
stud
of
the
telephone
box
yes
and
the
minimum
he
did
not
think
as
a
lesser
man
with
equal
knowledge
of
fleet
street
might
have
done
that
hampden
had
gone
mad
he
knew
that
conventionally
such
a
programme
was
impossible
but
he
had
known
of
impossible
things
being
done
and
in
any
case
he
understood
by
the
emphasis
that
this
was
what
hampden
would
have
done
under
freer
circumstances
that
is
what
i
leave
to
you
the
paragraphs
and
comment
at
some
length
i
shall
look
for
the
provinces
are
out
of
the
question
i
suppose
the
eight
leading
london
dailies
be
dealt
with
you
give
me
of
course
financially
absolutely
absolutely
guarantee
everything
to
them
let
them
arrange
for
special
trains
at
all
the
termini
let
them
take
over
all
the
garages
motor
companies
and
cab
yards
in
london
as
going
concerns
for
twelve
hours
they
will
all
be
in
it
except
and
we
can
deal
with
the
distributing
houses
later
you
see
the
three
points
it
is
the
patriotic
thing
to
do
at
any
cost
they
can
have
anything
they
like
to
make
up
time
and
it
is
absolutely
essential
yes
said
lidiat
and
the
matter
hampden
had
already
taken
a
pencilled
sheet
of
paper
from
his
pocket
he
had
written
it
on
his
way
up
to
kilburn
he
now
handed
it
to
the
journalist
between
four
and
five
that
will
be
telescribed
over
the
entire
system
he
explained
those
who
are
not
on
the
call
will
see
it
in
the
papers
or
hear
from
others
every
one
will
know
before
he
watched
lidiat
sharply
as
he
read
the
statement
apart
from
the
two
principals
he
was
the
first
man
in
england
to
receive
the
confidence
and
sir
john
had
a
curiosity
not
wholly
idle
to
see
how
it
would
strike
him
but
lidiat
was
not
to
use
an
obsolete
phrase
the
man
in
the
street
he
absorbed
the
essence
of
the
manifesto
with
a
trained
practical
grasp
and
then
held
out
his
hand
for
the
other
paper
while
his
large
glabrous
face
remained
merely
vacant
in
its
expression
the
next
paper
was
a
foreign
telegram
in
cipher
and
as
lidiat
read
the
decoded
version
that
was
pinned
to
it
the
baronet
saw
or
fancied
that
he
saw
the
flicker
of
a
keener
light
come
into
his
eyes
and
such
a
transient
wave
across
his
face
as
might
in
a
man
of
impulse
indicate
enthusiasm
or
appreciation
are
there
to
be
any
more
of
these
presently
was
all
he
said
i
think
that
i
might
authorise
you
to
say
that
there
will
be
others
to
publish
as
the
moment
seems
most
propitious
very
good
i
will
use
the
instruments
now
there
is
one
more
point
said
hampden
writing
a
few
short
lines
on
a
slip
of
paper
that
it
might
be
desirable
to
make
public
now
lidiat
took
the
paper
this
was
what
he
read
are
at
liberty
to
state
definitely
that
the
membership
of
the
unity
league
now
exceeds
five
million
there
was
a
plentiful
crop
of
grey
hairs
sown
between
charing
cross
and
ludgate
hill
in
the
early
hours
of
that
summer
morning
with
his
mouth
to
the
telephone
lidiat
stirred
up
the
purlieus
of
fleet
street
and
the
strand
until
office
after
office
composing
room
after
composing
room
and
foundry
after
foundry
all
along
the
line
began
to
drone
and
hum
resentfully
like
an
outraged
apiary
in
the
dead
of
night
when
he
once
took
up
the
wire
he
never
put
it
down
again
until
he
had
swept
the
london
dailies
morning
section
of
sell
and
mitchell
from
beginning
to
end
those
who
wished
to
retort
and
temporise
after
he
had
done
with
them
had
to
fall
back
upon
the
telescribe
which
involved
the
disadvantage
to
fleet
street
of
having
to
write
and
coldly
transmit
the
indignant
messages
that
it
would
fain
pour
hot
and
blistering
into
its
tormentor
ear
for
two
hours
and
a
half
by
the
watch
beneath
his
eye
he
harrowed
up
all
the
most
cherished
journalistic
traditions
of
the
land
and
from
a
small
room
a
mile
away
he
controlled
the
reins
of
the
fourth
estate
of
an
empire
a
large
fat
perspiring
man
of
persuasive
authority
and
conscious
of
unlimited
capital
at
his
back
by
the
end
of
that
time
chaos
had
given
place
to
order
had
shown
an
amenable
disposition
with
a
readiness
suggesting
that
it
possibly
knew
more
than
it
had
told
in
the
past
was
won
over
by
persuasion
and
the
condition
of
the
navy
and
mailed
was
clubbed
and
bullied
and
cajoled
with
big
names
until
it
was
dazed
for
seven
minutes
lidiat
poured
patriotism
into
the
ear
of
editor
and
gold
into
the
coffers
of
manager
and
then
turned
aside
to
win
over
daily
by
telling
it
what
daily
was
doing
and
the
by
reporting
the
acquiescence
morning
post
remained
obdurate
for
half
an
hour
and
only
capitulated
after
driving
down
and
having
an
interview
with
hampden
great
well
for
more
than
a
year
great
had
been
the
property
and
organ
of
the
league
only
no
one
had
suspected
it
the
little
beset
by
the
difficulty
of
blocks
and
frantic
at
the
thought
of
having
to
recast
its
plates
and
engage
in
the
mysteries
of
making
ready
again
after
half
its
edition
had
been
run
off
was
the
last
to
submit
so
long
was
it
in
making
up
its
mind
that
at
last
lidiat
sarcastically
proposed
an
inset
and
taking
the
suggestion
in
all
good
faith
the
startled
its
sober
patrons
by
bearing
on
its
outside
page
a
gummed
leaflet
containing
a
leaderette
and
two
news
paragraphs
so
the
list
spun
out
lidiat
did
not
touch
the
provinces
but
sixteen
london
dailies
including
some
sporting
and
financial
organs
marked
the
thoroughness
of
his
work
at
three
he
finally
hung
up
the
receiver
and
taking
the
brougham
rode
like
another
wellington
over
the
field
of
his
still
palpitating
waterloo
his
appearance
bovine
and
imperturbable
despite
the
shameful
incongruity
of
his
garb
when
revealed
in
the
tremulous
and
romantic
dawn
of
a
day
and
of
an
epoch
and
further
set
off
by
the
unimpeachable
correctness
of
the
equipage
from
which
he
alighted
was
a
thing
that
rankled
in
the
minds
of
lingering
compositors
and
commissionaires
until
their
dying
days
a
few
minutes
after
his
departure
hampden
returned
to
the
telephone
and
desired
to
make
the
curious
connection
telescribe
who
is
there
he
asked
when
telescribe
responded
the
man
at
the
other
end
explained
that
he
was
a
clerk
on
the
main
platform
of
telescribe
name
of
firkin
if
the
fact
was
of
metropolitan
interest
is
mr
woodbarrow
there
yet
it
appeared
with
increased
respect
that
mr
woodbarrow
was
in
his
own
office
and
could
be
informed
of
the
gentleman
name
please
tell
him
that
sir
john
hampden
wishes
to
speak
with
him
in
two
minutes
another
voice
filtered
through
the
wire
a
voice
which
hampden
recognised
what
are
you
running
with
now
mr
woodbarrow
he
asked
when
brief
courtesies
had
been
exchanged
mr
woodbarrow
made
an
enquiry
and
was
able
to
report
that
a
tangye
was
supplying
all
the
power
they
needed
at
that
hour
nothing
was
coming
through
he
explained
except
a
few
press
messages
from
america
a
little
business
from
australia
and
some
early
morning
news
from
china
i
should
be
obliged
if
you
would
put
on
the
two
westinghouses
as
soon
as
you
can
and
then
let
me
know
when
you
can
clear
the
trunk
lines
for
a
minute
within
the
next
hour
i
want
to
send
an
board
message
there
was
no
response
to
this
request
for
an
appreciable
five
seconds
but
if
ever
silence
through
a
telephone
receiver
conveyed
an
impression
of
blank
amazement
at
the
other
end
it
was
achieved
at
that
moment
do
i
rightly
understand
sir
john
enquired
mr
woodbarrow
at
the
end
of
those
five
seconds
that
you
wish
to
repeat
a
message
over
the
entire
system
that
is
quite
correct
it
will
constitute
a
record
an
interesting
occasion
then
have
you
calculated
the
fees
sir
john
no
i
have
not
had
the
time
you
will
let
me
know
when
the
power
is
up
mr
woodbarrow
only
just
beginning
to
realise
fully
the
magnitude
of
the
occasion
and
tingling
with
anticipation
promised
to
act
with
all
possible
speed
and
going
to
his
own
room
sir
john
took
up
an
agate
pen
and
proceeded
to
write
with
special
ink
on
prepared
paper
this
encyclical
despatch
a
library
of
books
had
been
written
on
the
subject
of
the
telescribe
within
two
years
of
its
advent
but
a
general
description
may
be
outlined
untechnically
in
a
page
or
two
it
was
for
the
moment
the
last
word
of
wireless
telegraphy
it
was
efficient
it
was
speedy
it
was
cheap
and
it
transmitted
in
facsimile
it
had
passed
the
stage
of
being
wondered
at
and
had
reached
that
of
being
used
it
was
universal
it
was
universal
that
is
not
in
the
sense
that
tongues
are
universally
in
heads
for
instance
but
to
search
for
a
parallel
as
universal
as
are
now
on
doors
in
houses
or
cuffs
around
men
wrists
there
were
in
point
of
number
about
three
millions
on
the
index
book
it
was
speedy
because
there
was
no
call
required
no
intervention
of
a
connecting
office
to
wait
for
that
was
purely
automatic
above
the
telescribe
box
in
one
hall
study
or
was
a
wooden
panel
studded
with
eight
rows
of
small
brass
knobs
sixteen
knobs
in
each
row
these
could
be
depressed
or
raised
after
the
manner
of
an
electric
light
stud
and
a
similar
effect
was
produced
a
connection
was
thereby
made
all
the
country
england
and
wales
was
mapped
out
into
sixteen
primary
divisions
oblong
districts
of
equal
size
the
top
row
of
brass
knobs
corresponded
with
these
divisions
and
by
pulling
down
any
knob
the
operator
was
automatically
put
into
communication
with
that
part
of
the
system
through
the
medium
of
the
huge
central
station
that
reared
its
trellised
form
like
an
eiffel
tower
above
the
hill
at
harrow
and
the
subsidiary
stations
which
stood
each
in
the
middle
of
its
division
the
second
stage
was
reached
by
subdividing
each
primary
division
into
sixteen
oblong
districts
and
with
these
the
second
row
of
knobs
corresponded
six
more
times
the
subdividing
process
was
repeated
and
each
subdivision
had
its
corresponding
row
the
final
division
represented
plots
of
ground
so
small
that
no
house
or
cottage
could
escape
location
pulling
down
the
corresponding
studs
on
the
eight
rows
instantly
and
automatically
established
the
connection
the
written
communication
could
then
be
transmitted
and
in
the
twinkling
of
an
eye
it
was
traced
on
a
sheet
of
paper
in
the
receiving
box
there
was
no
probability
of
the
spaces
all
being
occupied
with
telescribes
for
some
years
to
come
a
calculation
will
show
that
there
was
provision
for
a
good
many
thousand
million
boxes
but
only
three
million
were
fixed
and
attuned
at
this
period
that
briefly
was
the
essential
of
the
telescribe
system
it
was
invaluable
for
most
purposes
but
not
for
all
though
speedier
than
the
letter
it
lacked
its
privacy
when
it
reached
its
destination
and
it
also
in
the
eyes
of
many
lacked
the
sentimental
touch
as
from
hand
to
hand
which
a
letter
may
convey
it
carried
no
enclosures
of
course
and
owing
to
the
difficulties
of
ink
and
paper
printed
matter
could
not
be
telescribed
at
all
it
cost
twice
as
much
as
a
letter
but
as
this
was
spread
in
the
proportion
of
to
the
sender
and
one
quarter
to
the
receiver
the
additional
cost
was
scarcely
felt
by
either
thus
it
came
about
that
although
the
telescribe
had
diminished
the
volume
of
telegrams
by
ninety
per
and
had
made
it
possible
still
to
cope
with
a
volume
of
ordinary
postal
correspondences
which
up
to
that
time
had
threatened
to
swamp
the
department
it
had
actually
superseded
nothing
at
four
mr
woodbarrow
called
up
sir
john
and
reported
that
the
two
great
engines
were
running
smoothly
and
that
for
three
minutes
the
entire
system
would
be
closed
against
any
message
except
his
in
other
words
while
the
in
circuit
was
open
to
three
million
boxes
the
out
circuit
was
closed
against
all
except
one
it
was
not
an
absolutely
necessary
precaution
for
overlapping
telescripts
stored
latent
until
the
way
was
clear
but
it
was
not
an
occasion
on
which
to
hesitate
about
taking
every
safeguard
the
momentous
order
was
already
written
hampden
opened
the
lid
of
a
small
flat
box
supported
on
the
telescribe
shelf
by
four
vulcanite
feet
put
the
paper
carefully
in
and
closed
the
lid
again
he
had
pulled
down
the
eight
rows
of
metal
studs
in
anticipation
of
woodbarrow
message
and
there
was
only
one
more
thing
to
do
a
practical
unemotional
man
and
not
unused
in
an
earlier
decade
to
controlling
matters
of
national
importance
with
energy
and
decision
he
now
stood
with
his
hand
above
the
fatal
switch
not
in
any
real
doubt
about
his
action
but
with
a
kind
of
fascinated
a
minute
had
already
passed
to
pull
down
the
tiny
lever
and
release
it
would
not
occupy
a
second
at
what
period
of
those
three
minutes
should
he
do
it
how
long
he
leave
it
he
caught
himself
wondering
whether
on
the
last
second
and
with
an
angry
exclamation
at
the
folly
he
pressed
the
lever
home
there
was
no
convulsion
of
nature
a
little
bell
a
foot
away
gave
a
single
stroke
and
that
was
all
the
indication
that
the
president
of
the
unity
league
had
passed
the
rubicon
and
unmasked
his
battery
this
was
what
he
had
written
and
scattered
broadcast
over
the
land
the
unity
league
the
time
has
now
arrived
when
it
is
necessary
for
the
league
to
take
united
action
in
order
to
safeguard
the
interests
of
its
members
in
directing
a
course
which
may
entail
some
inconvenience
but
can
hardly
with
ordinary
foresight
result
in
real
hardship
your
president
reminds
you
of
the
warning
that
such
a
demand
would
inevitably
be
made
upon
your
sincerity
the
opportunity
is
now
at
hand
for
proving
that
as
a
class
our
resource
and
endurance
are
not
less
than
those
of
our
opponents
on
or
before
the
july
members
of
the
league
will
cease
until
further
notice
to
purchase
or
to
use

the
form
of
burning
coal
except
such
as
may
be
already
on
their

with
the

as

the

applies
to

who
do
not
possess

for
introducing
a

immediately
are

the

will
take
all
responsibility
and
will
defend
all
actions
for
breach
of
contract
of
the
league
are
earnestly
requested
to
in
this
line
of
action
both
as
regards
the
letter
and
the
spirit
of
the
members
are
emphatically
assured
that
every
possible
development
of
the
campaign
has
been
fully
considered
during
the
past
two
years
and
it
is
advanced
with
absolute
confidence
that
nothing
unforeseen
can
happen
to
mar
its
successful
conclusion
nothing
but
the
loyal
of
members
is
required
to
ensure
the
triumph
of
those
principles
of
government
which
the
league
has
always
advocated
and
a
complete
attainment
of
the
object
for
which
the
league
came
into
existence
john
hampden
trafalgar
chambers
london
in
the
past
the
world
had
seen
very
many
strikes
on
the
part
of
workers
not
selfishly
conceived
in
their
essence
but
bringing
a
great
deal
of
poverty
and
misery
in
their
train
and
declared
solely
for
the
purpose
of
benefiting
the
strikers
through
the
necessity
of
others
in
the
more
recent
past
the
world
had
seen
employers
combine
and
declare
a
few
strikes
the
word
will
serve
a
triple
purpose
for
just
the
same
end
and
accompanied
by
precisely
similar
results
it
was
now
the
turn
of
the
consumers
to
learn
the
strike
lesson
the
most
powerful
class
of
all
but
the
most
heterogeneous
to
weld
together
the
object
was
the
same
but
pursued
under
greater
stress
the
weapons
would
be
similar
but
more
destructive
the
track
of
desolation
would
be
there
but
wider
and
the
end
on
that
morning
of
the
of
july
the
end
lay
beyond
a
very
dim
and
distant
shock
of
dust
and
turmoil
that
the
eye
of
none
could
pierce
chapter
xiii
the
effect
of
the
bomb
mr
strummery
having
finished
his
breakfast
with
the
exception
of
a
second
glass
of
hot
water
which
constituted
the
amiable
man
only
beverage
took
up
his
copy
of
he
had
already
glanced
through
in
which
he
had
a
small
proprietary
interest
but
he
also
subscribed
to
partly
because
it
brought
to
his
door
a
library
which
he
found
useful
when
he
had
to
assume
an
intimate
knowledge
of
a
subject
at
a
day
notice
partly
because
the
crudely
blatant
note
of
occasionally
failed
to
strike
a
sympathetic
cord
he
had
found
that
morning
in
his
telescribe
receiver
the
trafalgar
chambers
manifesto
which
had
been
flashed
to
friend
and
foe
alike
he
had
read
it
with
a
frown
it
savoured
of
impertinence
that
it
should
be
sent
to
him
he
finished
it
with
a
laugh
he
saw
that
it
was
a
stupid
move
unless
the
league
had
abandoned
all
hope
of
forming
the
alliance
in
any
case
it
was
a
blow
that
stung
but
could
not
wound
all
the
chances
were
that
nothing
would
come
of
it
if
a
million
people
did
give
up
burning
coal
for
say
a
month
if
a
million
people
that
well
it
would
be
very
inconvenient
to
themselves
but
there
would
certainly
be
a
good
many
tens
of
thousand
pounds
less
wages
paid
out
in
districts
that
seemed
to
be
far
from
satisfactory
even
as
it
was
did
not
refer
to
the
matter
at
all
mr
strummery
opened
and
was
rather
surprised
to
see
beneath
five
lines
of
heavy
heading
on
the
leader
page
a
full
account
of
sir
john
sudden
move
instinctively
his
eye
turned
to
the
leader
columns
as
he
had
half
expected
there
was
a
leader
on
the
subject
not
very
long
but
wholly
benedictory
in
rather
less
measured
phrases
than
the
premier
organ
usually
adopted
and
with
other
signs
of
haste
readers
were
urged
to
enter
into
this
development
of
bloodless
civil
war
of
which
the
impending
personal
property
act
had
been
the
first
unmasked
blow
he
glanced
on
not
troubling
about
the
views
advanced
until
a
casual
statement
drew
a
smothered
exclamation
from
his
lips
an
argument
which
will
be
used
in
a
practical
form
by
the
five
million
adult
members
now
on
the
books
of
the
league
ran
the
information
it
is
a
lie
a
deliberately
misleading
lie
muttered
the
premier
angrily
but
it
was
the
truth
he
read
on
the
article
concluded
in
this
connection
the
strong
action
taken
by
gavard
as
indicated
in
the
telegrams
from
paris
which
we
print
elsewhere
may
be
purely
a
coincidence
but
it
is
curiously
akin
to
those
coincidences
that
fall
into
their
places
in
a
campaign
mr
strummery
had
no
difficulty
in
finding
the
telegrams
alluded
to
rushed
through
in
frantic
haste
the
type
had
stood
a
hair
breadth
higher
than
it
should
and
in
the
resulting
blackness
the
words
of
the
headlines
leapt
to
meet
his
eye
the
industrial
war
in
france
prohibitive
tax
on
coal
our
special
paris
it
is
authoritatively
stated
that
the
industrial
crisis
which
has
been
existing
in
the
north
and
to
some
extent
in
the
lyonnais
districts
for
the
past
six
months
is
on
the
eve
of
a
settlement
yesterday
gavard
returned
from
etienne
and
after
seeing
several
of
his
colleagues
and
some
leading
members
of
the
chamber
of
commerce
left
at
once
for
lens
early
this
morning
he
was
met
at
the
maison
du
peuple
by
deputations
from
the
syndicate
of
miners
the
the
association
of
mine
owners
the
valenciennes
iron
masters
and
representatives
of
some
other
industries
the
proceedings
were
conducted
in
private
but
it
is
understood
in
circles
here
that
in
accordance
with
the
plenary
powers
conferred
on
him
by
the
chambers
in
view
of
the
critical
situation
gavard
proposed
to
raise
the
small
existing
tax
on
imported
coal
to
an
tax
of
the
mine
owners
on
their
side
will
guarantee
a
minimum
wage
of
and
commence
working
at
once
reinstating
all
men
within
a
week
of
the
imposing
of
the
tax
the
amalgamated
industries
acquiesce
to
a
general
immediate
advance
of
per
ton
metric
in
the
price
of
coal
and
will
start
running
as
soon
as
the
first
portion
of
their
orders
can
be
filled
troops
are
still
being
massed
in
the
affected
districts
but
after
last
thursday
pitched
battle
a
tone
of
sullen
apathy
is
generally
preserved
there
was
however
severe
rioting
at
anzin
this
morning
and
about
casualties
are
reported
paris
the
terms
of
settlement
contained
in
my
earlier
message
are
confirmed
they
will
remain
in
operation
for
a
year
the
tax
will
come
into
force
almost
immediately
three
days
grace
being
allowed
for
vessels
actually
in
french
ports
to
unload
in
view
of
your
government
subsidy
to
english
coal
exportation
and
its
disastrous
effects
on
french
mining
and
subsequently
on
other
industries
the
imposition
of
the
tax
will
be
received
with
approval
in
most
quarters
as
the
prime
minister
reached
the
end
of
the
paragraph
he
heard
a
vehicle
stop
at
his
door
followed
by
an
attack
on
bell
and
knocker
that
caused
mrs
strummery
no
little
indignation
it
was
mr
tubes
arriving
after
indulging
in
the
unusual
luxury
of
a
cab
and
the
next
minute
he
was
shown
into
his
chief
presence
both
men
unconsciously
frowned
somewhat
as
they
met
but
the
was
infinitely
the
more
disturbed
of
the
two
you
got
my
he
asked
as
they
shook
hands
no
did
you
write
replied
mr
strummery
to
tell
the
truth
this
meddling
piece
of
imbecility
on
hampden
part
and
his
gross
impertinence
in
sending
it
to
me
put
everything
else
out
of
my
head
for
the
moment
you
have
seen
it
you
would
need
to
ask
that
if
you
passed
a
newspaper
shop
said
mr
tubes
grimly
the
newsbills
are
full
of
nothing
else
war
proclaimed
reply
to
the
tax
league
manifesto
and
a
dozen
more
i
had
private
word
of
it
last
night
but
too
late
to
do
anything
that
why
i
asked
half
a
dozen
of
them
vossit
guppling
chadwing
and
one
or
two
more
to
meet
me
here
at
nine
happen
a
few
others
will
drop
in
now
well
do
let
them
see
that
you
think
the
world
is
coming
to
an
end
said
the
premier
caustically
nothing
may
come
of
it
yet
that
all
very
well
strummery
said
mr
tubes
with
rising
anger
all
very
well
for
you
you
do
come
from
a
durham
division
i
shall
have
it
from
both
sides
twenty
thousand
howling
constituents
and
six
hundred
raving
members
let
them
rave
they
know
better
than
press
it
too
far
as
for
the
miners
if
they
have
to
lose
by
it
we
can
easily
make
grants
to
put
them
right
a
sudden
thought
struck
him
he
burst
out
laughing
well
tubes
he
exclaimed
boisterously
i
can
excuse
myself
but
i
should
have
thought
that
a
man
who
came
from
a
durham
constituency
would
have
seen
before
hampden
must
either
be
mad
or
else
he
knows
that
his
precious
league
wo
stand
very
much
do
you
see
we
are
in
the
middle
of
summer
now
and
the
next
three
months
people
will
be
burning
hardly
any
coal
at
the
home
secretary
jumped
up
and
began
to
pace
the
room
in
seething
impatience
before
he
could
trust
himself
to
speak
do
talk
like
that
before
the
house
with
fifty
practical
men
in
it
for
god
sake
strummery
he
exclaimed
passionately
hampden
well
have
contrived
a
more
diabolical
moment
do
you
know
what
the
conditions
are
well
listen
no
one
burning
any
coal
and
so
it
will
be
no
hardship
for
them
to
do
without
but
every
one
is
on
the
point
of
filling
his
cellar
at
summer
prices
to
last
all
through
the
winter
and
hampden
five
million
i
do
believe
that
interposed
the
premier
hastily
well
i
do
now
retorted
his
colleague
bitterly
his
five
million
are
the
five
million
biggest
users
of
domestic
coal
in
the
country
they
use
more
than
all
the
rest
put
together
and
they
all
fill
their
cellars
in
the
summer
or
autumn
then
suggested
mr
strummery
then
they
wo
now
replied
mr
tubes
that
all
the
next
ten
weeks
are
the
busiest
in
the
year
from
the
deepest
working
to
the
suburban
go
and
take
a
look
round
if
you
want
to
see
every
waggon
every
every
railway
siding
every
is
ready
only
the
cellars
are
empty
if
the
cellars
are
going
to
remain
empty
what
happens
he
threw
out
his
left
hand
passionately
with
a
vigorous
gesture
it
suggested
laden
coal
carts
crowded
yards
railways
all
flung
a
stage
back
on
to
the
already
congested
and
banking
up
coal
like
the
waters
of
the
divided
red
sea
into
a
scene
of
indescribable
confusion
the
prime
minister
sat
thinking
moodily
while
his
visitor
paced
the
room
and
bit
his
lips
with
unpleasant
vehemence
in
the
blades
of
morning
sun
as
he
crossed
and
recrossed
the
room
one
saw
that
mr
tubes
neither
tall
nor
stout
but
large
loosely
boned
loosely
dressed
and
loosely
groomed
had
light
blue
eyes
strong
yellow
teeth
which
came
prominently
into
view
as
he
talked
and
a
spotted
sallow
complexion
which
conveyed
the
unfortunate
and
unjust
impression
of
being
dirty
we
shall
have
to
do
something
to
carry
them
on
till
the
winter
all
declared
mr
strummery
at
length
there
no
doubt
that
the
leaguers
will
have
to
use
coal
then
it
no
good
thinking
that
we
can
settle
it
with
a
few
thousand
pounds
of
strike
pay
strummery
said
the
home
secretary
impatiently
because
we
ca
you
have
to
know
the
conditions
to
see
how
that
is
if
there
a
strike
the
article
has
to
be
supplied
from
somewhere
else
at
more
money
and
every
one
except
those
who
to
strike
keep
on
very
much
as
before
but
here
by
god
they
have
us
all
along
the
line
anything
from
fifty
to
a
hundred
thousand
miners
less
required
at
one
end
and
anything
from
five
to
ten
thousand
coal
carters
at
the
other
and
between
and
dependent
on
each
lot
all
through
his
arm
emphasised
the
situation
by
a
comprehensive
sweep
you
heard
say
that
coal
is
the
of
the
country
happen
he
added
well
we
the
heart
what
do
you
suggest
then
it
all
a
matter
of
money
if
it
can
be
done
we
must
make
up
the
difference
buy
it
pay
for
it
and
store
it
there
are
the
dockyards
the
barracks
and
we
could
open
depôts
here
and
in
all
the
big
towns
in
that
way
we
could
spread
it
over
as
long
a
period
as
we
liked
then
there
export
i
think
that
has
touched
its
limit
for
the
time
but
we
might
find
it
cheaper
in
the
end
to
stimulate
it
more
yes
but
what
about
this
french
business
are
you
allowing
for
that
in
your
estimate
what
french
business
the
french
tax
said
the
premier
impatiently
pointing
to
the
open
you
seen
about
it
have
you
he
had
not
he
snatched
up
the
paper
muttering
as
he
read
the
first
few
lines
that
he
had
glanced
through
before
he
came
out
and
that
had
been
all
his
voice
became
inaudible
as
he
read
on
when
he
had
finished
he
was
very
pale
he
flung
the
paper
down
and
walked
to
the
window
and
stood
there
looking
out
without
a
word
the
declaration
of
the
coal
war
had
filled
him
with
smouldering
rage
the
paris
telegram
had
effectually
chilled
it
before
he
had
felt
anger
now
he
felt
something
that
expressed
in
words
was
undistinguishable
from
fear
the
men
whom
he
had
asked
to
meet
him
there
were
beginning
to
arrive
they
had
already
heard
vossit
and
chadwing
pass
upstairs
talking
there
was
a
step
in
the
hall
outside
that
could
only
belong
to
tirrel
he
had
not
been
summoned
but
as
mr
tubes
had
anticipated
a
few
others
were
beginning
to
drop
in
guppling
and
two
men
whom
he
had
met
on
the
doorstep
came
in
as
mr
tubes
was
finishing
the
paris
news
it
not
much
good
talking
about
it
now
he
said
turning
from
the
window
but
if
i
had
known
of
or
even
that
the
other
would
be
out
i
should
have
come
here
myself
without
bringing
all
these
chaps
down
too
not
but
what
they
have
come
though
but
when
i
wrote
to
them
i
just
got
the
information
you
understand
and
it
was
thought
that
hampden
would
be
doing
anything
for
a
week
at
least
he
was
too
clever
for
you
again
said
strummery
vindictively
as
he
rose
to
go
upstairs
so
it
seems
admitted

indifferently

the
last
chance
and
the
counsel
of
expedience
in
the
salon
where
a
month
before
they
had
drafted
the
outline
of
the
personal
property
bill
under
the
impression
that
government
was
a
parlour
game
and
society
a
heap
of
spelicans
eight
or
nine
men
were
already
assembled
one
or
two
sat
apart
with
ugly
looks
upon
their
faces
mr
vossit
was
dividing
his
time
between
gazing
up
to
the
ceiling
and
making
notes
in
a
memorandum
book
as
the
points
occurred
to
him
sir
causter
kerr
baronet
of
the
united
kingdom
and
chevalier
of
the
order
of
the
golden
eagle
who
in
return
for
a
thousand
pounds
a
year
permitted
himself
to
be
called
first
lord
of
the
admiralty
in
a
socialist
government
was
standing
before
a
steel
engraving
with
the
title
in
german
defeat
of
the
british
at
majuba
hill
february
but
judging
from
the
slight
sardonic
grin
on
his
thin
features
he
was
thinking
of
something
else
sir
causter
kerr
had
assuredly
not
been
invited
to
the
meeting
the
rest
of
the
company
stood
together
in
one
group
where
they
talked
and
laughed
and
looked
towards
the
door
from
time
to
time
in
expectation
of
their
host
arrival
the
talk
and
laughter
dropped
to
a
whisper
and
a
smile
as
mr
strummery
entered
and
mr
tubes
followed
and
with
short
greetings
passed
to
their
places
at
the
table
the
prime
minister
was
popular
or
he
would
not
have
held
that
position
but
mr
tubes
was
not
he
was
home
secretary
by
virtue
of
the
voice
of
the
coal
interest
so
much
the
largest
labour
organisation
in
the
country
that
if
its
wishes
were
ignored
it
could
like
another
body
of
miners
in
the
past
very
effectively
demand
to
know
the
reason
why
well
jim
owd
lad
said
cecil
brown
hilariously
taking
advantage
of
the
fact
that
formal
proceedings
had
not
yet
commenced

cecil
brown
it
may
be
explained
held
that
he
had
the
privilege
of
saying
offensive
things
to
his
friends
without
being
considered
offensive
and
as
no
one
ever
thought
of
calling
him
anything
else
but
cecil
brown
he
was
probably
right
of
the
colonial
office
he
was
in
some
elation
at
the
moment
that
his
usually
despised
department
was
quite
out
of
this
imbroglio
ah
that
was
a
very
red
red
herring
i
more
than
thinking
now
said
mr
guppling
reflectively
certainly
a
salt
fish
eh
tirrel
said
cecil
brown
mr
strummery
rapped
sharply
on
the
table
with
his
knuckles
to
indicate
that
the
proceedings
had
better
begin
a
conscientious
man
he
entirely
missed
the
lighter
side
of
life
he
sometimes
laughed
but
in
conversation
his
face
never
lit
up
with
the
ready
spontaneous
smile
not
because
he
was
sad
but
because
he
failed
to
see
not
only
the
utility
of
a
jest
but
its
point
also
that
conversational
sauce
which
among
friends
who
understand
one
another
frequently
takes
the
outer
form
of
personal
abuse
was
to
him
merely
flagrant
insult
mr
tubes
leaned
across
and
spoke
to
his
chief
and
looking
down
the
table
the
premier
allowed
his
gaze
to
rest
enquiringly
on
sir
causter
kerr
a
man
who
been
invited
jumped
up
i
called
on
comrade
kerr
on
my
way
here
and
took
the
liberty
of
asking
him
to
come
because
i
thought
that
we
might
like
to
know
something
of
the
condition
of
the
navy
he
explained
for
what
purpose
enquired
mr
strummery
smoothly
because
he
replied
flaring
up
suddenly
with
anger
because
i
regard
this
damned
french
tax
without
a
word
of
notice
to
us
or
our
representative
as
nothing
more
or
less
than
a
the
proceedings
had
begun
case
of
tinned
rabbits
contemptuously
retorted
a
mr
bilch
sitting
opposite
what
think
you
going
to
do
if
it
is
why
my
infant
the
french
fleet
would
knock
you
and
your
into
a
packing
in
about
ten
minutes
if
you
tried
it
on
you
have
to
stomach
that
and
as
many
more
as
they
care
to
send
you
mr
bilch
was
a
new
man
and
was
spoken
of
as
a
great
acquisition
to
his
party
though
confessedly
uncertain
in
his
views
and
frequently
illogical
in
his
ground
his
strength
lay
in
the
happy
turns
with
which
his
speech
was
redolent
and
his
splendid
invulnerability
to
argument
reason
or
fact
he
had
formerly
been
a
and
would
doubtless
have
remained
inarticulate
and
unknown
had
he
not
one
day
smoothed
out
a
sheet
of
from
the
bin
before
him
as
he
ate
his
dinner
a
fully
reported
speech
was
therein
described
as
perhaps
the
greatest
oratorical
masterpiece
ever
delivered
outside
hyde
park
mr
bilch
read
the
speech
and
modestly
fancied
that
he
could
do
as
well
himself
from
that
moment
he
never
looked
back
and
although
he
was
still
a
plain
member
he
had
forced
his
way
by
sheer
merit
into
the
circle
of
the
council
chamber
it
is
against
our
principles
to
consider
that
contingency
interposed
the
premier
and
in
any
case
it
is
premature
to
talk
of
war
when
the
courts
of
arbitration
that
right
enough
interrupted
the
man
who
had
first
spoken
of
war
and
when
it
was
a
matter
of
fighting
to
grab
someone
else
land
to
fatten
up
a
gang
of
stock
exchange
hebrews
i
was
with
you
through
thick
and
thin
but
this
is
different
the
very
livelihood
of
our
people
is
aimed
at
i
nothing
to
say
against
the
hague
in
theory
but
when
you
remember
that
we
never
had
a
single
decision
given
in
our
favour
too
important
to
risk
to
that
but
why
france
should
have
done
this
in
this
way
and
just
at
this
moment
is
beyond
me
yet
it
was
not
difficult
to
imagine
when
many
english
manufactories
were
closed
down
altogether
or
removed
abroad
because
the
conditions
at
home
were
too
exacting
for
them
less
coal
was
required
in
england
less
coal
meant
fewer
colliers
employed
and
this
touched
the
government
most
keenly
the
same
amount
of
coal
be
dug
especially
as
the
operation
of
the
eight
hours
act
had
largely
increased
the
number
of
those
dependent
on
the
mines
therefore
more
must
be
exported
the
coal
tax
had
long
since
gone
a
substantial
bounty
was
now
offered
on
every
ton
shipped
out
of
the
country
it
made
a
brave
show
never
were
such
piping
times
known
from
kirkcaldy
to
cardiff
english
coal
could
be
shot
down
in
rouen
nantes
or
bordeaux
even
in
lille
and
limoges
at
a
price
that
defied
home
competition
prices
fell
french
colliery
proprietors
reduced
wages
french
miners
came
out
on
strike
a
general
strike
and
for
the
time
being
french
collieries
ceased
to
have
any
practical
existence
but
france
was
requiring
a
million
tons
of
coal
a
week
and
having
done
the
mischief
england
could
only
at
the
moment
let
her
have
a
quarter
of
a
million
a
week
while
german
and
belgian
coal
had
been
knocked
out
of
the
competition
and
diverted
elsewhere
the
great
industries
had
to
cease
working
chaos
civil
war
and
anarchy
began
to
reign
why
france
should
have
done
this
is
beyond
me
there
was
another
reason
deeper
it
was
a
commonplace
that
england
had
been
cordially
hated
in
turn
by
every
nation
in
and
out
of
europe
but
with
all
that
there
was
no
responsible
nation
in
or
out
of
europe
that
dare
contemplate
a
weak
a
dying
england
france
looked
at
the
map
of
europe
and
the
thought
of
the
german
eagle
flying
over
dover
castle
and
german
navies
patrolling
the
seas
from
land
end
to
the
skawe
haunted
her
dreams
russia
wanted
nothing
in
the
world
so
much
as
another
thirty
years
peace
spain
had
more
to
lose
than
to
gain
italy
had
much
to
lose
and
nothing
at
all
to
gain
all
the
little
independent
states
and
nations
remembered
the
treaties
of
vienna
and
berlin
and
trembled
at
the
thought
of
what
might
happen
now
germany
alone
might
have
had
visions
but
germany
had
a
nightmare
too
and
when
the
man
who
ruled
her
councils
with
a
strong
if
tortuous
policy
saw
wave
after
wave
of
the
infectious
triumph
of
socialism
reach
his
own
shores
he
recognised
that
england
weakness
was
more
hostile
to
his
ambitions
than
strength
no
one
wanted
two
turkeys
in
europe
i
do
see
why
we
should
make
a
naval
demonstration
at
all
events
some
one
suggested
hopefully
that
used
to
be
enough
and
the
french
government
must
have
plenty
to
look
after
at
home
naval
demonstration
be
boiled
exclaimed
mr
bilch
forcibly
send
your
little
willie
to
hamley
for
a
tin
steamer
and
let
him
push
it
off
ramsgate
sands
if
you
want
a
naval
demonstration
comrade
but
show
the
union
jack
inside
the
limit
on
the
other
side
of
the
channel
or
you
have
something
so
hot
drop
on
your
hands
that
you
wo
be
able
to
lick
it
off
fast
enough
i
fail
to
see
that
said
mr
vossit
heaven
forbid
that
i
should
raise
my
voice
in
favour
of
bloodshed
but
if
it
were
necessary
for
our
navy
is
at
least
equal
to
that
of
any
other
power
is
it
retorted
mr
bilch
with
so
an
expression
of
contemptuous
derision
on
his
face
that
it
seemed
as
though
he
might
be
able
to
take
it
off
like
a
mask
and
hang
it
on
some
one
else
is
it
oh
it
is
is
it
well
ask
that
man
there
ask
him
is
all
i
say
simply
ask
his
contorted
face
was
thrust
across
the
table
towards
mr
vossit
while
his
rigid
arm
with
extended
forefinger
was
understood
to
indicate
sir
causter
kerr
as
the
subject
has
been
raised
perhaps
the
first
lord
of
the
admiralty
will
reassure
us
on
that
point
said
the
premier
dear
dear
no
replied
causter
kerr
blandly
we
could
carry
it
through
premier
you
must
not
think
of
going
to
extremes
there
was
a
moody
silence
in
which
men
looked
angrily
at
kerr
and
at
one
another
are
we
to
understand
that
the
navy
is
equal
to
that
of
any
other
power
demanded
mr
vossit
on
paper
yes
comrade
replied
kerr
with
a
pitying
little
smile
but
on
deep
water
where
battles
are
usually
fought
no
it
is
a
curious
paradox
that
in
order
to
be
equal
to
any
other
single
power
england
must
be
really
very
much
stronger
i
should
also
explain
that
from
motives
of
economy
no
battleships
have
been
launched
or
laid
down
during
the
last
three
years
and
only
four
cruisers
of
questionable
armament
then
as
regards
gunnery
from
motives
of
economy
actual
practice
is
never
carried
out
now
but
the
championship
dating
from
last
year
lies
at
present
with
the
armoured
cruiser
stationary
regulation
target
miles
distant
speed
knots
quarter
charges
hits
out
of
shots
as
regards
effective
range
tell
them
this
struck
in
mr
bilch
they
understand
it
better
tell
them
that
the
could
sail
round
and
round
the
channel
fleet
and
bloody
well
throw
her
shells
over
the
moon
and
down
on
to
their
decks
without
ever
once
coming
into
range
tell
them
that
the
picture
so
graphically
drawn
by
comrade
bilch
is
substantially
correct
corroborated
sir
causter
kerr
the
together
with
three
other
battleships
of
her
class
has
an
effective
range
of
between
four
and
five
thousand
yards
more
than
that
of
any
english
ship
but
you
have
been
told
all
this
so
often
comrades
that
i
fear
it
can
not
interest
you
sir
causter
was
having
his
revenge
for
two
years
of
subservience
at
a
thousand
pounds
a
year
then
perhaps
you
will
tell
us
as
first
lord
of
the
admiralty
the
job
you
are
paid
for
doing
what
you
imagine
the
navy
is
kept
up
for
demanded
a
comrade
with
fierce
resentment
as
far
as
i
have
been
encouraged
to
believe
in
that
capacity
replied
kerr
with
easy
insolence
i
imagine
that
its
duties
consist
nowadays
in
patrolling
the
and
in
amusing
the
visitors
on
the
various
seaside
promenades
by
turning
the
searchlights
on
we
wo
ask
you
to
remain
any
longer
said
the
premier
sir
causter
kerr
rose
leisurely
good
morning
comrades
he
remarked
punctiliously
and
going
home
wrote
out
his
resignation
from
motives
of
patriotism
and
sent
a
copy
of
the
letter
to
all
the
papers
a
man
who
had
been
standing
by
the
door
listening
to
the
conversation
now
came
forward
with
a
copy
of
an
early
special
edition
of
the
mall
in
his
hand
you
need
sweat
yourselves
about
being
equal
to
a
single
power
or
not
he
remarked
with
an
unpleasant
laugh
look
at
the
there
and
he
threw
the
paper
on
the
table
as
though
he
washed
his
hands
of
it
and
many
other
things
mr
bilch
secured
it
and
turning
to
the
space
which
is
left
blank
for
the
inclusion
of
news
received
up
to
the
very
moment
of
going
to
press
he
read
aloud
the
single
item
it
contained
coal
war
berlin
the
action
which
france
is
reported
to
have
taken
had
for
some
time
been
anticipated
here
on
all
sides
there
is
the
opinion
amounting
to
conviction
that
germany
must
at
once
call
into
operation
the
power
lying
dormant
in
the
penalising
tariff
and
impose
a
tax
on
imported
coal
it
is
agreed
that
otherwise
in
her
frantic
endeavours
to
restore
the
balance
of
her
export
trade
england
would
flood
this
country
with
cheap
coal
and
precipitate
a
state
of
things
similar
to
that
from
which
france
is
just
emerging
emphasis
is
laid
on
the
fact
that
such
a
measure
will
be
and
in
no
way
aggressive
it
is
not
anticipated
that
the
tax
will
exceed
mks
or
at
the
most
mks
per
ton
export
value
eight
and
elevenpence
murmured
a
late
arrival
one
of
the
fifty
practical
men
in
the
house
yes
i
imagine
that
two
marks
fifty
will
just
about
knock
the
bottom
out
is
there
nothing
we
can
offer
them
in
exchange
demanded
some
one
nothing
we
can
hit
them
back
with
cecil
brown
who
was
suspected
of
heterodoxy
on
this
one
point
crystallised
the
tariff
question
into
three
words
nothing
but
tears
he
replied
if
there
one
thing
that
fairly
makes
me
hot
it
the
way
we
always
have
to
wait
for
some
one
else
to
tell
us
what
going
on
said
the
comrade
who
had
brought
in
the
mall
looking
across
at
the
foreign
office
resentfully
a
fellow
in
holborn
here
pokes
the
paper
under
my
nose
and
asks
me
what
we
going
to
do
about
it
and
there
i
do
even
know
what
is
being
done
at
us
what
i
want
to
know
is
what
our
ambassadors
and
foreign
office
think
there
for
it
always
the
same
and
then
there
be
the
questions
in
parliament
and
we
know
nothing
makes
us
look
like
a
set
of
amateurs
the
fact
had
been
noticed
former
governments
had
not
infrequently
earned
the
title
in
one
or
two
departments
later
governments
had
qualified
for
it
in
every
department
the
reason
lay
on
the
surface
the
members
of
those
parliaments
and
the
men
who
sent
them
were
themselves
bunglers
and
amateurs
in
their
daily
work
and
life
except
in
the
stereotyped
product
of
machinery
accuracy
was
scarcely
known
the
man
who
had
built
a
house
in
england
at
that
period
the
man
who
had
had
a
built
to
order
the
man
who
had
stipulated
for
one
article
to
be
made
like
a
copy
the
man
who
had
been
so
unfortunate
as
to
require
the
plumbers
in
the
man
who
had
to
do
with
labour
in
any
shape
or
form
the
man
who
had
been
faithfully
promised
delivery
or
completion
by
a
certain
stated
time
the
woman
who
shopped
the
person
who
merely
existed
with
open
eyes
could
all
testify
out
of
experiences
some
heartrending
some
annoying
some
simply
amusing
that
precision
and
reliability
scarcely
existed
among
the
lower
grades
of
industry
and
commerce
it
was
a
period
of
transition
the
worker
had
cast
off
the
love
the
delicacy
the
intelligence
of
the
craftsman
and
he
had
not
yet
attained
to
the
unvarying
skill
of
the
automaton
in
another
century
one
man
would
only
be
able
to
fix
throttle
valve
connections
on
to
pipes
but
his
fixing
of
throttle
valves
would
be
a
thing
to
dream
about
while
the
initial
letter
a
of
his
brother
whose
whole
life
would
be
devoted
to
engraving
initial
letter
a
on
brass
plates
would
be
as
near
unswerving
perfection
as
mundane
initials
ever
could
be
makes
us
look
like
a
set
of
tinkerin
amateurs
one
inference
is
plain
enough
said
mr
guppling
smoothing
over
the
suggestion
these
three
things
were
going
to
happen
all
together
of
their
own
accord
there
a
deep
game
somewhere
and
seeing
what
at
stake
our
powers
ought
to
be
wide
enough
for
us
to
put
our
hands
on
them
and
stop
it
there
was
a
murmur
of
approval
having
been
taken
by
surprise
the
idea
of
peremptorily
stopping
it
was
a
peculiarly
attractive
one
but
there
were
malcontents
who
were
not
to
be
appeased
so
easily
and
a
comrade
pennefarthing
who
had
arrived
in
the
meantime
raised
an
old
cry
in
a
new
form
i
wo
exactly
say
that
we
been
betrayed
he
declared
glancing
at
the
group
of
orthodox
ministers
who
sat
together
but
game
or
no
game
i
will
say
that
we
been
damned
badly
served
with
information
comrade
tirrel
stood
up
he
had
not
yet
spoken
at
all
and
he
was
accorded
instant
silence
for
men
were
beginning
to
look
to
him
it
is
now
nearly
eleven
he
said
in
his
quick
incisive
tone
and
some
of
us
have
been
here
for
upwards
of
an
hour
we
met
to
consider
a
situation
that
situation
still
remains
may
i
ask
that
the
home
secretary
who
is
doubly
qualified
for
the
task
should
tell
us
the
extent
of
the
danger
and
its
probable
effect
if
mr
tubes
possessed
a
double
qualification
he
also
laboured
under
a
corresponding
disability
as
the
representative
of
a
mining
constituency
a
practical
expert
and
a
leading
member
of
a
government
which
existed
by
the
goodwill
of
the
workers
largely
of
the
miners
it
would
be
scarcely
to
his
interest
to
minimise
the
gathering
cloud
as
the
minister
for
the
home
department
the
blacker
he
made
the
picture
the
greater
the
volume
of
obloquy
he
drew
upon
his
head
for
not
having
foreseen
the
danger
the
more
relief
he
asked
for
the
fiercer
the
opposition
he
would
encounter
from
hostile
sections
and
from
the
perturbed
heads
of
a
depleted
treasury
we
are
still
very
much
in
the
dark
as
to
what
has
really
happened
is
happening
and
will
happen
he
remarked
tamely
an
appreciable
drop
in
the
demand
for
coal
whether
for
home
or
export
will
certainly
have
a
disturbing
effect
on
the
conditions
of
labour
in
many
departments
but
the
difficulties
of
estimating
the
effects
are
so
great
there
were
murmurs
whatever
might
be
the
failings
of
socialistic
oratory
flatness
and
excess
of
moderation
did
not
lie
among
them
figures
suggested
tirrel
pointedly
perhaps
comrade
tirrel
will
take
the
job
in
hand
instead
of
me
said
tubes
bitterly
but
without
any
show
of
anger
doubtless
he
get
a
better
hearing
no
replied
tirrel
gravely
the
moment
is
too
critical
for
recrimination
if
the
home
secretary
lays
the
position
frankly
before
us
he
will
have
no
cause
to
complain
of
an
unsympathetic
hearing
nor
as
far
as
i
can
speak
of
a
support
in
taking
means
to
safeguard
it
it
occurred
to
mr
tubes
then
for
the
first
time
in
his
life
and
it
was
almost
like
a
shock
to
feel
it
that
the
man
who
had
always
seemed
to
throw
himself
into
sharp
antagonism
to
himself
might
be
actuated
by
higher
motives
than
personal
jealousy
after
all
he
continued
his
speech
if
we
accept
the
figure
of
five
millions
as
a
correct
return
of
the
unity
league
membership
and
if
we
assume
that
they
will
all
obey
the
boycott
then
we
are
face
to
face
with
the
fact
that
on
the
basis
of
a
four
ton
per
person
average
twenty
million
tons
of
coal
must
be
written
off
the
home
consumption
but
the
four
tons
per
head
average
includes
the
entire
industrial
consumption
of
the
country
objected
mr
vossit
that
is
so
admitted
mr
tubes
but
it
also
includes
a
great
many
people
whose
use
of
coal
is
practically
an
alternative
basis
is
to
assume
that
two
millions
of
the
members
are
then
taking
ten
tons
a
year
as
their
average
household
consumption
and
admitting
that
all
the
wealthiest
men
in
the
country
are
included
the
average
is
not
too
high
we
arrive
at
just
the
same
result
the
exports
on
the
other
hand
do
not
depend
on
estimate
we
have
the
actual
returns
france
takes
fifteen
million
tons
in
round
numbers
for
the
purpose
of
facing
the
worst
we
may
therefore
assume
that
the
work
of
digging
and
handling
million
tons
will
be
suddenly
cut
off
germany
some
one
reminded
him
germany
is
wholly
conjectural
at
present
i
have
no
objection
to
taking
it
into
account
as
well
if
it
is
thought
desirable
but
i
would
point
out
that
we
are
being
influenced
by
the
merest
rumour
no
objected
tirrel
but
without
any
enmity
i
think
that
we
must
regard
germany
as
lost
we
are
just
beginning
to
touch
the
outskirts
of
a
vast
organisation
which
has
been
quietly
perfecting
its
plan
of
operation
for
years
i
do
not
regard
a
german
tax
as
settled
because
of
this
one
rumour
but
i
do
regard
it
as
settled
because
at
this
precise
moment
the
rumour
has
been
allowed
to
appear
germany
ten
millions
accepted
mr
tubes
total
decrease
million
tons
do
you
be
too
sure
of
that
comrade
warned
mr
bilch
why
not
twelve
yet
by
a
long
way
there
be
half
a
dozen
editions
out
before
the
winners
mr
bilch
evidently
regarded
his
shaft
that
each
fresh
edition
might
contain
a
new
country
imposing
a
tax
humorously
but
several
comrades
looked
towards
the
home
secretary
enquiringly
the
other
large
importers
are
italy
russia
sweden
egypt
spain
and
denmark
said
mr
tubes
who
could
have
talked
coal
statistics
for
hours
if
necessary
all
these
with
the
possible
exception
of
russia
import
it
is
unlikely
that
the
estimate
i
have
given
will
be
exceeded
from
that
cause
and
the
result
above
and
below
about
a
million
men
are
now
employed
in
raising
tons
it
is
simple
arithmetic
in
less
than
a
month
about
two
hundred
thousand
more
men
will
be
out
of
work
mr
chadwing
chancellor
of
the
exchequer
moved
uneasily
in
his
chair
that
is
the
full
extent
enquired
cecil
brown
no
admitted
the
home
secretary
that
is
the
inevitable
direct
result
million
tons
less
will
be
carried
by
rail
or
cart
or
ship
or
all
three
a
fair
sprinkling
of
carters
dockers
stokers
sailors
and
other
fellows
will
be
dropped
off
too
there
will
be
fewer
railway
trucks
built
this
next
year
less
doing
in
the
trade
several
thousand
horses
not
wanted
a
slight
falling
off
in
work
there
is
not
a
trade
in
england
from
to
that
will
not
be
a
little
worse
off
because
of
those
tons
then
the
two
hundred
thousand
miners
will
burn
less
coal
at
home
the
ships
and
the
engines
will
burn
less
and
the
workshops
and
the
smithies
will
burn
less
and
the
whole
process
will
be
repeated
again
and
again
for
coal
is
like
a
snowball
in
its
cumulative
effects
and
it
can
not
stand
still
if
mr
tubes
had
come
to
compromise
he
had
remained
to
publish
broadcast
perhaps
no
one
quite
understood
the
danger
yet
for
the
mind
used
to
everyday
effects
does
not
readily
grasp
the
extent
of
a
calamity
and
six
hours
before
there
had
not
been
a
cloud
even
the
size
of
a
hand
on
their
horizon
the
premier
thought
it
was
impolitic
on
his
colleague
part
the
treasury
officials
looked
on
it
as
a
move
to
force
their
hands
the
foreign
was
suspicious
that
mr
tubes
was
leading
away
by
some
mysterious
from
the
unpreparedness
of
his
own
department
to
foreign
office
remissness
they
all
continued
to
look
silently
at
the
home
secretary
as
he
continued
to
stand
the
indirect
effects
will
involve
about
two
million
people
to
some
extent
he
summed
up
that
at
least
is
the
worst
said
cecil
brown
with
an
encouraging
smile
for
mr
tubes
remained
standing
the
prime
minister
made
an
impatient
movement
the
treasury
heads
looked
at
one
another
and
said
with
their
eyes
he
is
really
overdoing
it
the
foreign
office
man
scowled
unconsciously
and
cecil
brown
continued
to
smile
consciously
the
worst
is
this
that
a
great
many
pits
are
working
at
a
bare
profit
partly
in
the
hope
of
better
things
partly
because
we
stimulate
the
trade
the
crisis
we
are
approaching
will
hang
over
the
coal
fields
like
a
blight
and
one
crippled
industry
will
bring
down
another
the
poorer
mines
will
close
down
you
need
only
look
back
to
to
see
that
neither
i
nor
any
one
else
can
give
you
a
forecast
of
what
that
will
involve
but
you
may
be
sure
of
this
that
although
with
its
tons
of
a
decrease
the
english
coal
fields
for
a
decade
was
a
shrimp
to
what
this
is
going
to
be
then
let
us
stimulate
the
trade
more
until
the
crisis
is
over
suggested
cecil
brown
mr
tubes
gave
a
short
dry
laugh
i
commend
that
course
to
comrade
chadwing
he
said
as
he
sat
down
the
chancellor
of
the
exchequer
was
busy
with
his
papers
let
me
dispel
any
idea
of
that
kind
at
once
he
remarked
without
looking
up
the
moment
is
not
only
an
unfortunate
one
it
is
an
utterly
impossible
one
for
making
any
extra
disbursement
however
desirable
well
said
mr
bilch
looking
round
on
the
moody
assembly
paternally
it
seems
that
the
situation
is
like
this
here
mates
the
navy
is
no
messin
good
at
all
same
as
i
told
you
the
army
a
bit
worse
treasury
empty
yes
the
home
office
do
know
what
going
on
at
home
and
the
foreign
office
possesses
just
the
same
amount
of
valuable
information
as
to
what
is
happening
abroad
lively
ai
it
well
lucky
that
bilch
is
still
bilch
no
one
rose
to
his
mordant
humour
even
cecil
brown
had
forgotten
how
to
smile
if
our
comrade
has
any
suggestion
to
make
said
the
premier
discouragingly
yes
sir
replied
mr
bilch
i
have
the
wisdom
of
the
serpent
to
rub
into
your
necks
if
you
only
listen
we
have
any
navy
so
we
fight
if
we
wanted
to
we
have
any
money
so
we
ca
pay
out
tubes
here
does
know
what
going
to
happen
at
home
and
jevons
rightly
know
what
has
happened
abroad
what
is
to
be
done
i
tell
you
wait
wait
and
see
wait
and
let
them
all
simmer
down
again
why
he
cried
boisterously
looking
round
on
them
in
friendly
contempt
to
see
your
happy
smiling
faces
one
would
think
that
the
canary
had
died
or
the
lodger
gone
off
without
paying
his
rent
for
why
because
a
bloke
in
a
and
a
top
hat
gets
on
to
a
wooden
horse
and
blows
a
tin
trumpet
and
the
export
trade
in
a
single
article
of
commerce
is
temporarily
disarranged
perhaps
mr
strummery
nodded
half
the
treasury
men
smiled
together
mr
chadwing
murmured
very
true
and
nearly
every
one
looked
relieved
comrade
bilch
was
certainly
a
rough
member
but
the
man
had
a
shrewd
and
they
began
to
feel
that
they
had
been
hasty
in
their
dismal
forebodings
have
we
been
threatened
with
this
and
that
before
demanded
mr
bilch
dogmatically
of
course
we
have
and
what
came
of
it
nothing
have
there
been
strikes
and
some
big
some
little
every
year
according
to
comrade
tubes
this
is
going
to
be
the
champion
that
remains
to
be
seen
what
i
say
is
do
play
into
their
hands
in
a
panic
wait
and
see
what
required
that
do
commit
us
to
anything
it
may
be
too
late
then
said
mr
tubes
but
he
said
may
now
and
not
will
there
may
be
no
need
to
do
anything
then
replied
mr
bilch
and
remember
this
that
the
minute
you
begin
to
shout
you
make
one
all
round
us
all
at
us
my
what
a
run
on
the
old
bank
there
would
be
but
if
you
go
on
just
as
usual
taking
no
notice
of
no
one
why
before
long
there
will
come
a
wet
day
or
a
cold
night
and
johnny
hampden
aunt
will
say
to
johnny
hampden
grandmamma
dear
i
feel
positively
starved
do
you
think
that
we
might
have
a
fire
without
johnny
knowing
and
the
old
lady
will
say
do
you
know
my
pet
i
was
just
going
to
say
the
same
thing
myself
suppose
you
run
out
and
buy
a
sack
of
coal
and
before
you
can
say
every
blessed
aunt
and
mother
and
first
cousin
of
the
unicorn
league
will
be
getting
in
her
little
stock
of
coal
it
was
what
every
one
wished
to
believe
and
therefore
they
were
easily
persuadable
it
was
a
national
characteristic
the
country
had
never
entered
into
a
war
during
the
past
fifty
years
without
being
assured
by
every
authority
from
the
down
to
the
suburban
barber
that
as
soon
as
the
enemy
got
a
little
tap
on
the
head
they
would
be
making
for
home
howling
for
peace
as
they
went
all
these
men
had
known
strikes
many
had
been
involved
in
them
some
had
controlled
their
organisation
they
had
seen
the
men
of
their
own
class
loyally
and
patiently
facing
poverty
and
hardship
for
the
sake
of
a
principle
and
enduring
day
after
day
and
week
after
week
and
if
necessary
month
after
month
they
had
seen
the
women
of
their
own
class
preaching
courage
and
practising
heroism
by
the
side
of
their
men
while
their
bodies
were
racked
by
cold
and
hunger
and
their
hearts
were
crushed
by
the
misery
around
they
had
seen
even
the
children
of
their
class
learning
an
unnatural
fortitude
they
accepted
it
as
a
commonplace
of
life
an
asset
on
which
they
could
rely
they
did
not
believe
that
any
other
class
could
do
it
did
not
occur
to
them
to
consider
whether
the
officers
of
an
army
are
usually
behind
the
rank
and
file
in
valour
sacrifice
or
endurance
doubtless
there
were
among
them
some
who
were
not
deceived
but
they
wilfully
subordinated
their
clearer
judgment
to
the
policy
of
the
moment
tirrel
was
the
one
exception
there
can
be
no
more
fatal
mistake
of
the
dangerous
position
into
which
we
have
been
manoeuvred
than
to
assume
that
we
shall
be
easily
delivered
from
it
by
the
weakness
of
our
opponents
before
we
have
the
least
indication
that
weakness
exists
he
declared
as
soon
as
mr
bilch
had
finished
speaking
vigorously
but
without
any
of
the
assertiveness
and
personal
feeling
that
had
gained
him
many
enemies
in
the
past
i
agree
with
every
word
that
comrade
tubes
has
spoken
we
all
do
we
all
admit
it
or
be
blind
what
on
earth
then
have
we
to
hope
for
in
a
policy
of
drift
of
sitting
tight
and
doing
nothing
in
the
hope
of
things
coming
round
of
their
own
accord
it
is
madness
my
comrades
sheer
madness
i
tell
you
and
a
month
hence
it
will
be
suicide
he
dropped
his
voice
and
swept
the
circle
of
faces
with
a
significant
glance
it
is
through
such
madness
on
the
part
of
others
that
we
are
here
mr
chadwing
smiled
the
thin
smile
of
expediency
it
is
one
thing
for
a
comrade
with
no
official
responsibility
to
say
that
a
certain
course
does
not
satisfy
him
he
said
it
may
be
quite
another
thing
for
those
who
have
to
consider
ways
and
means
to
do
anything
different
perhaps
comrade
tirrel
will
kindly
enlighten
us
as
to
what
in
our
position
he
would
do
i
see
two
broad
courses
open
replied
tirrel
without
any
hesitation
in
accepting
the
challenge
both
as
you
will
readily
say
have
their
disadvantages
but
neither
is
so
fatal
as
inaction
the
first
is
aggressive
the
unity
league
has
declared
war
on
us
very
well
let
it
have
war
i
would
propose
to
suspend
the
arrest
hampden
and
salt
declare
the
object
and
existence
of
the
unity
league
illegal
close
its
offices
and
confiscate
its
funds
there
are
between
five
and
ten
million
pounds
somewhere
do
you
reflect
what
that
would
do
it
would
at
least
keep
two
hundred
thousand
miners
from
actual
starvation
for
a
year
prompt
action
would
inevitably
kill
the
boycott
movement
at
home
the
foreign
taxes
my
comrades
you
would
probably
find
to
have
a
very
marked
though
perhaps
undiscoverable
connection
with
the
home
movement
and
when
the
latter
was
seen
to
be
effectually
dealt
with
i
venture
to
predict
that
the
former
could
be
compromised
if
the
confiscated
funds
were
not
sufficient
to
meet
the
distress
i
should
not
hesitate
to
requisition
for
state
purposes
in
a
time
of
national
emergency
all
incomes
above
a
certain
figure
in
a
clean
sweep
a
medley
of
cries
met
this
despotic
programme
throughout
even
friends
felt
that
he
was
throwing
away
his
reputation
and
he
had
more
enemies
than
friends
you
simply
make
the
situation
twice
as
involved
exclaimed
mr
vossit
as
the
mouthpiece
of
the
babel
the
liberty
of
the
subject
it
would
mean
civil
war
they
rise
who
would
rise
demanded
tirrel
the
privileged
classes
but
they
risen
he
declared
vehemently
this
civil
war
what
more
do
you
want
it
was
a
question
on
which
they
all
had
views
and
for
the
next
five
minutes
the
room
was
full
of
suggestions
not
of
what
they
themselves
wanted
but
of
what
would
be
the
probable
action
of
the
classes
if
driven
to
extremities
very
well
assented
tirrel
at
last
that
is
what
they
will
do
next
as
it
is
for
they
consider
that
they
are
in
extremities
well
comrade
said
mr
bilch
broadly
you
do
seem
to
have
put
your
money
on
a
winner
this
event
what
your
other
tip
failing
that
the
other
reasonable
course
is
conciliation
i
would
suggest
approaching
hampden
and
salt
to
find
out
whether
they
are
open
to
consider
a
compromise
the
details
would
naturally
require
careful
handling
but
if
both
sides
were
willing
to
come
to
an
understanding
a
basis
could
be
found
as
things
are
i
should
consider
it
a
gain
to
drop
the
personal
property
tax
the
minimum
wage
bill
to
guarantee
the
inviolability
of
capital
against
further
taxation
while
we
are
in
office
and
to
make
generous
concessions
for
the
fuller
representation
of
the
monied
classes
in
parliament
in
return
for
the
abandonment
of
a
coal
war
the
dispersal
in
some
agreed
way
of
the
league
reserves
the
reduction
of
the
subscription
to
a
nominal
sum
and
a
frank
undertaking
that
the
league
would
not
adopt
a
hostile
policy
while
the
agreement
remained
in
force
this
proposal
was
even
less
to
the
temper
of
the
meeting
than
the
former
one
had
been
and
the
latter
half
of
it
was
scarcely
heard
among
the
fusillade
of
hostile
cries
no
one
laughed
when
a
comrade
stood
upon
a
chair
and
howled
traitor
tirrel
looked
round
on
the
assembly
practically
every
man
who
had
a
tacit
right
to
join
in
the
deliberative
council
had
arrived
and
the
room
was
full
but
there
was
not
a
single
member
among
them
willing
to
face
the
necessity
for
strong
and
immediate
action
and
they
were
hostile
to
the
man
who
just
touched
the
secret
depths
of
their
unconfessed
and
innermost
misgivings
mr
tubes
felt
that
he
had
done
his
duty
and
need
not
invite
reference
to
his
delicate
position
by
further
emphasising
unpalatable
truths
he
had
presented
the
spectacle
of
a
weak
man
startled
into
boldness
now
he
was
sufficiently
himself
again
to
go
with
the
majority
the
more
responsible
members
of
the
government
distrusted
tirrel
in
every
phase
the
smaller
fry
relied
on
the
wisdom
of
orthodoxy
and
agreed
that
the
man
who
could
blow
the
hotness
of
extirpation
and
the
coldness
of
conciliation
with
the
same
breath
must
prove
an
unworthy
guide
and
on
every
hand
there
was
the
tendency
of
settled
authority
to
deprecate
novel
and
unmatured
proceedings
tirrel
had
become
the
hampden
of
an
earlier
decade
among
his
party
you
call
me
he
said
turning
to
the
man
who
had
done
so
write
down
the
word
comrade
and
then
if
you
will
bring
it
to
me
without
a
blush
six
months
hence
i
will
wear
it
round
my
neck
in
penance
he
bowed
to
the
premier
and
withdrew
not
in
anger
or
with
a
mean
sense
of
injustice
but
because
he
felt
that
it
would
be
sheer
mockery
to
share
the
deliberations
of
a
council
when
their
respective
views
on
a
matter
which
he
believed
to
be
the
very
crux
of
their
existence
were
antagonistic
in
their
essences
after
his
departure
the
progress
was
amazing
his
proposals
had
cleared
the
air
every
one
knew
exactly
what
he
did
not
want
and
that
was
a
material
step
towards
arriving
at
the
opposite
goal
at
the
end
of
a
few
hours
a
very
effective
and
comprehensive
scheme
for
quietly
and
systematically
doing
nothing
had
been
almost
unanimously
arrived
at
several
quires
of
paper
had
been
covered
with
suggestions
some
of
them
being
accepted
as
they
stood
some
recommended
for
elaboration
some
passed
for
future
consideration
some
thrown
out
the
ambassador
in
paris
was
to
retire
on
the
ground
of
if
he
could
not
satisfactorily
explain
the
position
a
special
mission
was
to
be
sent
to
berlin
to
get
really
at
the
bottom
of
things
and
if
possible
have
the
tax
either
not
put
on
or
taken
off
according
to
the
situation
when
they
arrived
there
a
legal
commission
was
to
rout
out
every
precedent
to
see
if
the
unity
league
was
not
doing
something
outside
the
powers
of
a
trade
union
a
very
forlorn
hope
and
all
over
the
country
enquiries
were
to
be
made
and
assurances
given
all
very
discreetly
and
without
the
least
suggestion
of
panic
the
only
doubtful
point
was
whether
every
one
else
would
play
the
game
with
the
same
delicate
regard
for
ministerial
susceptibilities
or
whether
some
might
not
have
the
deplorable
taste
to
create
scenes
send
deputations
demand
work
with
menace
claim
the
literal
fulfilment
of
specific
pledges
incite
to
riot
and
violence
stampede
the
whole
community
and
otherwise
act
inconsiderately
towards
the
government
when
they
discovered
the
very
awkward
circumstances
in
which
their
leaders
had
involved
them
the
first
indication
of
a
jarring
note
fell
to
the
lot
of
the
president
of
the
board
of
trade
in
the
shape
of
a
telegram
which
reached
him
early
on
the
following
morning
this
was
its
form
from
the
council
of
the
amalgamated
union
of
chimney
sweepers
and
federated
carpet
beaters
membership
seventeen
million
estimated
chimneys
stop
smoking
no
soot
precious
little
dust
where
the
hell
do
we
come
in
blankintosh
a
few
years
before
it
had
been
officially
discovered
that
there
were
four
or
five
curiously
adaptable
words
without
which
the
working
man
was
quite
unable
to
express
himself
in
the
shortest
sentence
when
on
very
ceremonious
occasions
he
was
debarred
their
use
he
at
once
fell
into
a
pitiable
condition
of
aphasia
keenly
alive
to
the
disadvantages
under
which
these
men
existed
the
government
of
that
day
declared
that
it
was
a
glaring
anomaly
that
the
poor
fellows
should
not
be
allowed
to
use
a
few
words
that
were
so
essential
to
their
expression
of
every
emotion
while
the
rich
with
more
time
on
their
hands
could
learn
a
thousand
synonyms
the
law
imposing
a
shilling
fine
for
each
offence
five
shillings
in
the
case
of
a
gentleman
for
even
then
there
was
one
law
for
the
rich
and
another
for
the
poor
was
therefore
repealed
and
the
working
man
was
free
to
swear
as
much
as
he
liked
anywhere
which
to
do
him
justice
he
had
done
all
along
it
was
for
this
reason
that
mr
blankintosh
pointed
little
message
was
accepted
for
transmission
but
there
was
evidently
a
limit
for
when
the
president
of
the
board
of
trade
an
irascible
gentleman
who
had
in
the
colloquial
phrase
got
out
of
bed
on
the
wrong
side
that
morning
dashed
off
a
short
reply
it
was
brought
back
to
him
by
a
dispirited
messenger
two
hours
later
with
the
initials
of
seventeen
postmasters
and
the
seventeen
times
repeated

inadmissible
chapter
xv
the
great
fiasco
the
government
allowed
the
day
of
july
to
pass
without
a
sign
they
were
as
their
supporters
convincingly
explained
to
anxious
enquirers
treating
the
unity
league
and
all
its
works
with
silent
contempt
they
were
doing
nothing
strategically
they
wished
it
to
be
understood
a
very
different
thing
from
doing
nothing
through
apathy
indecision
or
bewilderment
but
very
often
undistinguishable
the
one
from
the
other
in
the
result
on
the
day
of
july
seventeen
million
estimated
chimneys
ceased
to
pollute
the
air
the
league
was
not
concerned
with
the
exact
number
and
they
accepted
the
chimney
sweepers
figures
it
was
more
to
the
purpose
that
the
order
was
being
loyally
and
cheerfully
obeyed
the
idea
of
fighting
the
government
with
the
government
own
chosen
people
appealed
to
the
lighter
side
of
a
not
unhumorous
nation
ever
since
the
institution
of
a
socialistic
press
and
from
even
remoter
times
than
the
saplinghood
of
the
reformer
tree
fleet
street
party
hacks
and
hyde
park
demagogues
had
been
sharpening
their
wit
upon
the
brigade
the
contemptible
of
linton
villas
claremonts
and
holly
lodges
taunting
them
with
political
apathy
and
social
parasitism
the
proportion
of
moral
degradation
conferred
by
a
coat
intentionally
black
in
comparison
with
one
that
is
merely
approaching
that
condition
through
the
personal
predilections
of
its
owner
has
never
yet
been
defined
and
the
relative
æsthetic
values
of
the
architectural
pretensions
of
villadom
compared
with
the
unswerving
realism
of
the
gas
works
views
railway
approach
cottages
and
cement
terraces
of
the
back
streets
may
be
left
to
the
matured
judgment
of
an
unprejudiced
posterity
the
great
middle
class
in
all
its
branches
had
never
hitherto
made
any
reply
at
all
now
that
it
had
begun
to
retort
in
its
own
effective
way
the
government
agreed
that
the
best
counterblast
would
be
to
wait
until
it
all
blew
over
there
were
naturally
defections
from
the
first
a
friendly
spy
in
mr
tubes
secret
service
managed
to
secure
the
information
without
much
trouble
that
within
seven
days
of
the
publication
of
the
order
no
less
than
notices
of
resignation
had
been
received
at
headquarters
he
was
hastening
away
with
this
evidence
of
the
early
dissolution
of
the
league
when
his
grinning
informant
called
him
back
to
whisper
in
his
ear
that
during
the
same
period
there
had
been
new
members
enrolled
and
that
while
the
resignations
seemed
to
have
practically
ceased
the
enrolments
were
growing
in
volume
in
addition
to
these
there
were
battalions
who
joined
in
the
policy
of
the
league
through
sympathy
with
its
object
without
formally
binding
themselves
as
members
in
some
of
its
aspects
the
success
of
the
movement
erred
in
excess
there
were
men
manufacturers
who
in
their
faith
and
enthusiasm
wished
to
close
their
works
at
once
and
regardless
of
their
own
loss
throw
their
workmen
and
their
unburnt
coal
into
the
balance
it
was
not
required
it
was
not
even
desirable
then
the
league
object
was
to
disorganise
commerce
as
little
as
possible
beyond
the
immediate
boundaries
of
the
coal
trade
they
were
not
engaged
in
an
internecine
war
and
every
one
of
their
own
people
deprived
of
employment
was
a
loss
cases
of
hardship
there
would
be
they
are
common
to
both
sides
in
every
phase
of
stubborn
and
prolonged
civil
strife
but
from
the
class
point
of
view
coal
had
the
advantage
that
its
weight
and
bulk
gave
employment
to
a
hundred
of
the
masses
to
every
one
of
themselves
there
were
also
two
circumstances
that
discounted
any
sense
of
injustice
on
this
head
firstly
there
was
a
spirit
of
sacrifice
and
heroism
in
the
air
born
of
the
time
and
the
situation
and
secondly
it
soon
became
plain
that
the
league
was
engaged
in
vast
commercial
undertakings
and
was
absorbing
all
the
men
of
its
own
party
who
were
robbed
of
their
occupation
by
the
development
of
the
war
a
firm
starting
business
with
an
unencumbered
capital
of
ten
million
sterling
enjoying
a
private
income
of
five
millions
a
year
and
not
troubled
with
the
necessity
of
earning
any
dividend
at
all
could
afford
to
be
a
generous
employer
from
the
first
moment
it
was
obvious
that
oil
must
take
the
place
of
coal
that
was
the
essence
of
the
strife
set
to
work
in
frantic
haste
to
prove
that
it
was
impossible
to
show
that
all
the
authorities
of
the
past
and
present
had
agreed
that
no
real
substitute
for
coal
existed
it
was
quite
true
and
it
was
quite
false
it
was
not
a
world
struggle
abroad
foreign
coal
was
being
substituted
for
english
coal
at
home
only
half
a
million
tons
a
week
were
in
issue
at
the
first
afterwards
as
coal
stagnation
fed
coal
stagnation
the
tonnage
rose
steadily
but
the
calorific
ratio
of
coal
and
oil
the
basis
of
all
comparison
simply
did
not
exist
except
on
paper
for
the
two
fuels
in
domestic
use
second
article
convinced
its
readers
that
all
the
lamp
companies
in
the
world
could
not
keep
up
with
the
abnormal
demand
for
lamps
stoves
and
that
the
ridiculous
proposal
of
the
league
would
involve
if
it
were
not
providentially
ordained
that
it
was
foredoomed
to
grotesque
failure
by
the
dead
weight
of
its
own
fatuous
ineptitude
in
practice
the
two
single
firms
of
ripplestone
of
birmingham
and
schuyler
of
cleveland
at
once
put
on
the
market
a
varied
stock
that
filled
every
requirement
there
was
no
waiting
as
bitterly
remarked
it
soon
became
apparent
that
the
demand
had
been
foreseen
and
treacherously
provided
against
during
the
past
two
years
the
third
article
on
the
situation
dealt
statistically
with
the
oil
trade
of
the
world
it
necessarily
fell
rather
flat
because
special
commissioner
entered
upon
the
task
with
the
joyous
conviction
that
the
world
output
would
not
be
sufficient
for
the
demand
the
world
oil
ships
not
numerous
enough
to
transport
it
as
he
dipped
into
the
figures
however
he
made
the
humiliating
discovery
that
the
increased
demand
would
do
little
more
than
ruffle
the
surface
of
the
oil
market
the
baku
oil
fields
could
supply
it
without
inconvenience
the
united
states
could
do
it
by
contract
at
a
ten
per
cent
advance
the
wells
of
nova
scotia
alone
would
be
equal
to
the
demand
if
they
diverted
all
their
produce
across
the
atlantic
he
threw
down
his
pen
in
despair
and
then
picked
it
up
again
to
substitute
invective
for
statistics
before
his
eyes
the
of
the
oil
company
of
london
and
philadelphia
and
the
oil
company
of
london
and
baku
were
going
on
their
daily
rounds
it
was
still
a
matter
for
wonder
how
well
equipped
the
sudden
call
had
found
those
two
great
controlling
oil
companies
it
was
yet
to
be
learned
that
for
their
elaborate
designations
there
might
be
substituted
the
simple
name
unity
league
it
was
submitting
young
man
to
rather
a
cruel
handicap
to
send
him
to
the
british
museum
reading
room
for
a
few
hours
with
instructions
to
prove
impossible
what
salt
and
hampden
had
been
straining
every
nerve
for
two
years
to
make
inevitable
three
articles
exhausted
his
proof
that
a
successful
coal
boycott
under
modern
conditions
was
utterly
impossible
he
went
out
into
the
city
and
the
suburbs
interviewing
coal
merchants
and
coal
agents
with
the
object
of
drawing
a
harrowing
picture
of
the
gloom
and
depression
that
had
fallen
upon
these
unfortunate
creatures
at
the
hands
of
their
own
class
league
he
found
them
all
bearing
up
well
under
the
prospect
but
much
too
busy
to
give
him
more
than
a
few
minutes
of
their
time
every
one
of
them
had
been
appointed
an
oil
agent
to
the
league
firms
and
league
members
were
ordering
their
oil
through
them
just
as
heretofore
they
had
ordered
coal
it
was
very
easy
profitable
work
for
them
they
had
nothing
to
do
but
to
transmit
the
orders
to
the
league
firms
and
the
fast
distributed
the
oil
but
half
of
the
coal
carters
were
now
under
notice
to
leave
and
there
were
indications
that
work
was
very
scarce
each
displaced
twenty
men
and
twenty
horses
already
it
was
said
thousands
of
horses
had
been
sent
out
to
grass
from
london
alone
externally
as
far
as
the
capital
was
concerned
at
all
events
things
were
going
on
very
much
the
same
as
before
when
the
struggle
was
a
fortnight
old
elsewhere
signs
were
not
lacking
the
government
had
received
disquieting
reports
from
its
agents
here
and
there
but
so
far
it
was
meeting
the
situation
by
refusing
to
acknowledge
that
it
existed
a
march
of
the
staffordshire
miners
had
been
averted
by
the
leaders
being
privately
assured
that
it
would
embarrass
the
plans
the
march
had
been
deferred
under
protest
so
far
the
organisation
answered
to
the
wheel
but
the
midlands
were
clamorously
demanding
exceptional
relief
for
the
exceptional
conditions
monmouth
had
seen
a
little
rioting
and
in
glamorgan
the
bands
of
incendiaries
called
beaconmen
who
set
fire
to
the
accumulations
of
coal
stacked
at
the
collieries
had
already
begun
their
work
cardiff
was
feeling
the
effect
of
having
a
third
of
its
export
trade
in
coal
suddenly
lopped
off
and
newport
swansea
kirkcaldy
blyth
hull
sunderland
glasgow
and
the
tyne
ports
were
all
in
the
same
position
most
of
the
railways
had
found
it
necessary
to
dispense
with
their
entire
supernumerary
staff
and
most
of
the
railway
workshops
had
been
put
on
short
time
in
london
alone
between
four
and
five
thousand
gas
employés
were
drawing
government
pay
about
the
third
week
in
august
the
premier
mr
tubes
and
the
chancellor
of
the
exchequer
had
a
long
private
conference
as
a
result
mr
strummery
called
an
emergency
council
it
was
a
thin
acrimonious
gathering
some
one
brought
the
tidings
that
seven
more
companies
in
south
london
were
substituting
diesel
oil
engines
for
steam
he
had
all
the
dreary
developments
statistically
worked
out
on
paper
nobody
wanted
to
hear
them
but
he
poured
them
out
into
the
unwilling
ears
down
to
the
climax
that
it
represented
two
hundred
and
fewer
men
required
at
the
pits
it
served
as
a
text
however
for
mr
chadwing
to
hang
his
proposal
on
after
a
month
of
inaction
the
government
was
at
length
prepared
to
go
to
the
length
of
admitting
that
abnormal
conditions
prevailed
oil
had
thrown
a
quarter
of
a
million
of
their
people
out
of
employment
let
oil
keep
them
he
proposed
to
retaliate
with
a
per
cent
tax
on
imported
oil
to
come
into
operation
under
emergency
procedure
on
the
of
september
there
were
men
present
to
whom
the
suggestion
of
taxing
a
raw
article
necessary
to
a
great
proportion
of
the
poor
was
frankly
odious
they
were
prepared
to
attack
the
proposal
as
a
breach
of
faith
a
few
words
from
mr
strummery
scarcely
more
than
whispered
explained
the
necessity
for
the
tax
and
the
menace
of
the
situation
those
who
had
not
been
following
events
closely
paled
to
learn
the
truth
the
treasury
was
living
from
hand
to
mouth
for
the
city
had
ceased
to
take
up
its
bills
unless
something
happened
before
the
new
year
dawned
it
would
have
to
admit
its
inability
to
continue
the
unemployed
grant
already
a
quarter
of
a
million
men
and
their
dependents
in
addition
to
the
normal
average
upon
which
the
estimates
were
based
had
been
suddenly
thrown
upon
the
resources
of
the
department
if
mr
forecast
proved
correct
double
that
number
would
be
on
their
hands
within
another
month
the
development
of
half
a
million
starving
men
who
had
been
taught
to
look
to
the
government
for
everything
looking
and
finding
nothing
could
be
left
to
each
individual
imagination
the
oil
tax
came
into
operation
on
the
of
september
under
the
plea
of
becoming
more
a
great
many
of
the
parliamentary
safeguards
had
been
swept
away
and
such
procedure
was
easy
all
grades
of
petroleum
had
already
advanced
a
few
pence
the
gallon
under
the
increased
demand
and
the
poorer
users
had
expressed
their
indignation
when
they
found
one
day
that
the
price
had
suddenly
leapt
to
half
as
much
again
their
wrath
was
unbounded
it
was
in
vain
for
ministers
to
explain
that
the
measure
was
directed
against
their
enemies
they
knew
that
it
fell
on
and
demanded
in
varying
degrees
of
politeness
to
be
told
why
some
luxury
of
the
pampered
leisured
classes
had
not
been
chosen
instead
the
reason
was
plain
to
those
who
studied
blue
books
so
highly
taxed
was
every
luxury
now
that
the
least
fraction
added
to
its
burden
resulted
in
an
actually
decreased
revenue
from
that
source
but
if
the
mere
tax
and
increase
had
impressed
the
poor
unfavourably
a
circumstance
soon
came
to
light
that
enraged
them
in
spite
of
the
tax
the
members
of
the
unity
league
were
still
being
supplied
with
oil
at
the
old
prices
and
they
were
assured
that
they
would
continue
to
be
supplied
without
advance
even
if
the
tax
were
doubled
the
poor
ever
suspicious
of
the
doings
of
those
of
their
own
class
when
set
high
in
authority
at
once
leapt
to
the
conclusion
that
they
were
being
made
the
victims
of
a
double
game
it
was
nothing
to
them
that
the
and
the
companies
were
now
trading
at
a
loss
it
was
common
knowledge
that
their
richer
league
neighbours
had
not
had
the
price
of
their
oil
increased
and
they
knew
all
too
well
that
they
themselves
had
with
the
lack
of
balanced
reasoning
that
had
formerly
been
one
of
the
government
best
weapons
they
at
once
concluded
that
they
alone
were
paying
the
tax
and
the
unparalleled
injustice
of
it
sowed
a
crop
of
bitterness
in
their
hearts
if
that
was
the
net
result
at
home
the
foreign
effect
of
the
policy
was
not
a
whit
more
satisfactory
studland
the
at
odessa
one
of
the
most
capable
men
in
the
service
cabled
a
despatch
full
of
temperate
and
solemn
warning
the
moment
he
heard
of
the
step
it
was
too
late
then
if
indeed
his
words
would
have
been
regarded
russia
replied
by
promptly
trebling
her
existing
tax
on
imported
coal
and
at
the
same
time
gave
germany
rebate
terms
that
practically
made
it
a
tax
on
coal
it
was
said
that
russia
had
only
been
waiting
for
a
favourable
opportunity
and
was
more
anxious
to
develop
her
own
new
coal
fields
in
the
donetz
basin
than
to
import
at
all
as
far
as
the
treasury
was
concerned
the
oil
tax
yielded
little
more
than
was
absorbed
by
the
thirty
thousand
extra
men
thrown
out
of
work
by
russia
action
the
government
had
given
a
rook
for
a
bishop
a
little
time
ago
the
cabinet
had
been
prepared
to
greet
winter
as
a
friend
without
quite
possessing
the
ingenuousness
of
their
amiable
comrade
bilch
they
had
thought
cynically
of
the
pampered
aristocrats
shivering
in
mayfair
of
the
middle
classes
sitting
before
their
desolate
suburban
hearths
of
men
setting
out
breakfastless
for
freezing
offices
and
of
pallid
women
weeping
as
they
tried
to
warm
the
hands
of
little
children
as
they
put
them
in
their
icy
beds
and
now
all
their
cynical
sympathy
had
apparently
been
in
vain
there
were
not
going
to
be
any
cold
breakfasts
freezing
offices
or
shivering
women
and
children
warming
stoves
and
radiators
raised
the
temperature
of
a
room
much
quicker
than
a
fire
did
and
kept
it
equable
without
any
attention
oil
cookers
took
the
place
of
the
too
often
erratic
kitchen
range
mrs
strummery
innocently
threw
the
premier
into
a
frenzy
one
morning
by
dilating
on
the
advantages
of
a
britonette
stove
which
she
had
been
shown
by
a
tottenham
court
road
ironmonger
the
despised
helpless
classes
were
going
on
very
comfortably
they
were
going
on
even
gaily
oil
scrambles
constituted
a
new
and
popular
form
of
entertainment
for
long
evenings
from
wimbledon
came
the
information
that
candle
cinderellas
would
have
a
tremendous
rage
during
the
approaching
season
and
in
cheapside
and
the
strand
the
penny
hawkers
were
minting
money
with
the
novel
and
diverting
coal
sack
puzzle
but
the
winter
was
approaching
though
no
longer
as
a
friend
if
england
should
say
what
lancashire
was
saying
that
day
there
were
portents
of
stirring
times
in
the
air
already
northumberland
durham
and
yorkshire
were
muttering
in
their
various
uncouth
dialects
and
lanark
was
subscribing
to
disquieting
sentiments
in
its
own
barbarous
tongue
derbyshire
was
becoming
uneasy
staffordshire
was
scarcely
answering
to
the
wheel
and
nottingham
was
in
revolt
against
what
it
considered
to
be
the
too
compliant
attitude
of
the
representation
committee
the
rioting
in
monmouth
was
only
restrained
from
becoming
serious
in
its
proportions
by
the
repeated
assurances
from
westminster
that
the
end
was
in
sight
and
the
beaconmen
of
glamorgan
were
openly
boasting
that
before
long
they
would
light
such
a
candle
that
the
ashes
would
fall
upon
london
like
a
vesuvian
cloud
still
nearer
home
was
the
disturbing
spectacle
of
the
thrown
out
of
work
the
coal
carters
the
stablemen
the
gasworkers
the
canal
boatmen
the
general
labourers
the
the
the
chimney
sweepers
the
brushmakers
the
sequence
of
dependence
could
be
traced
detail
by
detail
through
every
page
of
the
trade
directory
they
had
all
been
taught
to
clamour
to
the
government
in
every
emergency
and
this
administration
they
regarded
as
peculiarly
their
own
it
was
not
a
case
of
frankenstein
monster
getting
out
of
hand
this
monster
had
created
its
frankenstein
and
could
dissolve
him
if
he
proved
obstinate
all
that
frankenstein
had
ventured
to
do
so
far
had
been
to
reduce
the
unemployed
grant
to
three
quarters
of
its
normal
rate
in
view
of
the
unprecedented
conditions
of
labour
and
where
two
or
more
unemployed
were
members
of
one
family
to
make
a
further
small
deduction
the
action
had
not
been
well
received
in
view
of
the
unprecedented
conditions
of
labour
the
unemployed
had
looked
for
more
rather
than
for
less
when
the
rate
was
fixed
they
had
been
given
to
understand
that
it
represented
the
minimum
on
which
an
man
could
be
decently
asked
to
live
why
then
had
their
own
party
reduced
it
funds
tax
some
luxury
even
the
government
assurance
an
ingenious
adaptation
of
truth
by
the
light
of
mr
chadwing
figures
that
they
did
not
anticipate
having
to
impose
the
reduced
grant
for
many
more
weeks
but
at
the
same
time
counselled
economy
in
every
home
did
not
restore
mutual
good
feeling
the
general
rejoinder
was
that
the
government
had
better
not
and
the
reference
to
economy
was
stigmatised
as
gratuitously
inept
in
the
meantime
the
situation
was
reacting
unfavourably
upon
mr
strummery
and
the
chief
officers
of
state
not
only
in
parliament
but
even
in
the
cabinet
itself
consultations
between
the
premier
and
half
a
dozen
of
his
most
trusted
ministers
were
of
daily
occurrence
one
day
towards
the
end
of
september
mr
strummery
privately
intimated
to
all
the
safe
members
of
the
council
that
it
was
necessary
to
meet
to
consider
what
further
steps
to
take
the
meeting
was
a
packed
one
in
that
the
tirrels
the
browns
and
the
bilches
of
the
party
were
not
invited
and
knew
nothing
of
it
there
was
no
reason
why
mr
strummery
should
not
call
together
a
section
of
his
followers
if
he
wished
and
discuss
policy
with
them
but
at
the
moment
it
was
dangerous
because
the
conclave
was
just
strong
enough
to
be
able
to
impose
its
will
upon
parliament
and
yet
individually
it
was
composed
of
weak
men
it
was
dangerous
because
half
a
dozen
weak
men
rendered
desperate
by
the
situation
into
which
they
were
being
inevitably
driven
had
resolved
to
act
upon
heroic
lines
as
balzac
had
remarked
there
is
nothing
more
horrible
than
the
rebellion
of
a
sheep
but
the
horrible
consequences
generally
fall
upon
its
own
head
in
the
end
mr
chadwing
statement
informed
the
despondent
gathering
that
on
the
existing
lines
it
would
be
necessary
to
suspend
the
wholesale
operation
of
the
relief
fund
about
the
middle
of
december
by
reducing
the
grant
in
varying
degrees
it
would
be
possible
to
carry
on
for
perhaps
three
months
beyond
that
date
but
to
reach
the
furthest
limit
the
individual
relief
would
have
become
so
insignificant
that
it
would
only
result
in
an
actual
crisis
being
precipitated
earlier
than
would
be
the
case
if
they
went
on
as
they
were
doing
that
was
all
that
the
chancellor
of
the
exchequer
had
to
say
the
uninitiated
men
looked
at
one
another
in
mute
enquiry
there
was
something
in
the
air
what
was
coming
the
premier
rose
to
explain
he
admitted
that
they
had
underrated
the
danger
of
the
situation
at
first
measures
that
might
have
sufficed
then
were
useless
now
oil
was
the
pivot
of
the
whole
question
the
oil
tax
had
not
realised
expectations
to
raise
the
tax
would
only
alienate
the
affections
of
their
own
people
without
reaching
the
heart
of
the
matter
they
had
already
taken
one
bite
at
a
cherry
he
paused
and
looked
round
an
indifferent
swimmer
forced
by
giant
circumstance
to
face
his
niagara
he
proposed
as
a
measure
of
national
emergency
to
prohibit
the
importation
of
oil
altogether
there
was
a
gasp
of
surprise
a
moment
of
stupefaction
strange
things
were
again
being
done
in
the
name
of
liberty
mr
tubes
voice
enumerating
the
results
and
advantages
of
the
step
recalled
their
wandering
thoughts
there
was
little
need
for
the
recital
the
effect
of
so
unexpected
a
leapt
to
the
mind
at
once
the
leaguers
must
either
burn
coal
or
starve
the
home
oil
deposits
had
long
ceased
to
be
worked
wood
under
modern
conditions
was
impracticable
peat
was
equally
debarred
and
neither
could
meet
a
sudden
emergency
in
sufficient
quantity
electricity
meant
coal
and
was
far
from
universal
the
league
movement
must
collapse
within
a
week
there
were
other
points
all
in
favour
of
the
course
although
it
might
slightly
inconvenience
many
homes
it
would
not
take
their
money
as
a
heavier
tax
would
and
it
must
convince
all
that
the
end
was
well
in
sight
it
would
induce
the
poor
to
use
more
coal
more
gas
in
itself
a
step
towards
that
desired
end
it
would
teach
russia
a
sharp
lesson
and
russia
sins
were
the
freshest
in
their
minds
all
were
convinced
and
all
against
their
will
there
was
something
sinister
in
the
proposal
the
thought
of
it
fell
like
a
shadow
across
the
room
it
is
not
a
course
i
would
recommend
or
even
assent
to
as
a
general
thing
said
mr
strummery
but
we
are
fighting
for
the
existence
of
our
party
for
the
lives
of
thousands
of
our
people
it
is
no
exaggeration
think
of
the
awful
misery
that
must
sweep
the
country
in
the
coming
winter
if
the
league
holds
out
if
we
do
not
break
the
wicked
power
of
those
two
men
there
is
no
picture
of
national
calamity
to
be
found
in
the
past
that
can
realise
the
worst
it
is
their
game
said
mr
tubes
bitterly
the
cowards
are
striking
at
the
women
and
children
through
the
men
he
ignored
the
fact
that
his
party
had
struck
the
first
blow
and
had
had
the
word
war
figuratively
nailed
to
the
staff
of
their
red
banner
for
years
in
war
one
usually
strikes
some
one
and
on
the
whole
it
is
perhaps
less
reprehensible
to
strike
women
and
children
through
men
than
but
it
was
an
acceptable
sentiment
on
the
face
of
it
and
it
sounded
all
right
at
the
moment
moreover
added
the
premier
there
will
be
this
danger
in
the
situation
that
blinded
by
passions
and
desperate
through
misery
the
people
may
fail
to
realise
who
are
the
real
causes
of
their
plight
yes
there
was
that
possibility
to
be
faced
by
thoughtful
socialistic
ministers
the
people
are
not
very
subtle
in
their
reasoning
the
most
pressing
fact
of
their
existence
would
be
that
the
government
which
had
promised
to
keep
them
from
starvation
in
return
for
their
votes
had
had
their
votes
and
was
allowing
them
to
starve
i
think
that
we
must
all
agree
to
the
necessity
of
the
step
said
one
of
the
minor
men
though
our
feelings
are
all
against
it
quite
so
admitted
mr
strummery
let
us
hope
that
being
a
sharp
remedy
it
will
only
need
to
be
a
short
one
surprise
was
the
essence
of
the
and
the
procedure
of
parliament
permitted
this
when
the
government
was
backed
by
a
large
automatic
majority
the
expeditious
passing
of
the
measure
was
a
foregone
conclusion
yet
a
few
shrewd
warning
voices
were
raised
against
it
even
among
the
stalwarts
the
regular
opposition
voted
against
it
as
a
matter
of
course
the
most
moderate
section
of
the
labour
party
and
the
extreme
socialists
who
both
elected
to
sit
on
the
opposition
side
of
the
house
refrained
from
voting
and
a
few
ministers
who
were
distracted
between
their
private
opinions
and
their
party
duty
were
diplomatically
engaged
elsewhere
the
bill
first
received
the
attention
of
the
house
on
the
of
september
the
day
after
the
premier
had
called
his
informal
meeting
it
became
law
on
the
and
three
days
later
the
of
october
great
britain
was
absolutely
closed
against
the
introduction
of
mineral
burning
oils
on
any
terms
the
country
received
the
measure
with
mixed
feelings
but
on
the
whole
with
the
admission
that
it
would
be
effective
and
with
an
expression
of
dislike
the
coal
mining
districts
hailed
it
with
enthusiasm
and
the
same
reception
was
accorded
it
among
the
affected
industries
but
outside
these
it
was
nowhere
popular
and
in
certain
quarters
it
evoked
the
bitterest
hostility
it
was
felt
even
by
those
who
stood
to
gain
much
by
the
overthrow
of
the
league
that
their
instincts
rebelled
against
the
means
possibly
the
underlying
feeling
was
distrust
of
the
exercise
of
power
so
despotic
it
was
admitted
that
the
league
action
with
respect
to
coal
stood
on
a
different
plane
any
member
could
at
once
resign
it
was
questionable
if
one
could
not
use
coal
and
still
remain
a
member
certainly
no
coercion
was
used
but
in
the
matter
of
oil
a
necessary
commodity
was
absolutely
ruled
out
and
whether
he
wished
or
nor
every
one
must
obey
by
the
of
october
the
retail
price
of
petroleum
of
an
average
quality
was
the
gallon
and
the
price
was
rising
as
the
end
of
the
stock
came
in
sight
one
curious
circumstance
excited
remark
the
unity
league
members
were
still
being
supplied
at
the
original
price
the
league
was
keeping
its
word
gallantly
to
the
end
the
government
had
calculated
that
the
two
interested
companies
might
have
a
reserve
that
would
last
a
week
the
average
stock
which
the
consumer
might
be
supposed
to
have
in
hand
would
carry
them
on
for
a
further
five
days
and
the
economy
which
they
would
doubtless
practise
might
hold
off
the
climax
for
five
more
the
of
october
came
to
be
confidently
mentioned
in
government
circles
as
the
date
of
the
unity
league
surrender
it
might
have
been
merely
coincidence
but
on
the
of
october
mr
strummery
chose
to
entertain
a
few
of
his
colleagues
to
dinner
in
the
house
in
spite
of
the
host
inevitable
jug
of
boiling
water
an
air
of
genial
humour
almost
of
gaiety
pervaded
the
board
mr
tubes
was
entertainingly
reminiscent
chadwing
succeeded
in
throwing
off
the
weight
of
the
treasury
comrade
stubb
fresh
from
the
soil
proved
to
have
a
dry
humour
of
his
own
and
cecil
brown
who
was
always
socially
welcome
made
a
joke
which
almost
surprised
the
premier
into
a
smile
mr
tubes
was
in
the
middle
of
a
sentence
when
cecil
brown
with
his
face
turned
towards
the
door
laid
his
hand
upon
the
speaker
arm
a
minute
tubes
he
said
there
is
something
unusual
going
on
out
there
perhaps
it
is
began
chadwing
and
stopped
the
same
thought
had
occurred
to
at
least
three
of
them
perhaps
they
were
coming
to
tell
them
that
hampden
had
accepted
his
defeat
whatever
it
might
be
a
dozen
members
who
had
entered
the
room
in
a
confused
medley
were
making
their
way
towards
the
premier
table
a
man
who
seemed
to
concentrate
their
attention
was
in
their
midst
some
were
apparently
trying
to
hold
him
back
while
others
urged
him
on
while
yet
some
distance
off
he
broke
away
from
them
all
and
running
forward
reached
the
table
first
it
was
comrade
bilch
so
dishevelled
red
and
heated
that
it
did
not
occur
to
any
one
to
doubt
that
he
was
drunk
for
a
second
he
stood
looking
at
them
stupidly
and
then
he
suddenly
opened
his
mouth
and
poured
out
so
appalling
a
string
of
vile
and
nauseating
abuse
that
men
who
were
near
drew
aside
why
in
heaven
name
do
you
take
him
away
exclaimed
cecil
brown
appealing
to
those
who
formed
the
group
beyond
the
table
they
would
have
done
so
but
comrade
bilch
raised
his
hand
as
though
to
enjoin
attention
for
a
moment
a
change
seemed
to
have
come
over
him
even
in
that
brief
passage
of
time
he
walked
up
to
the
table
and
leaned
heavily
upon
it
with
both
fists
while
his
breath
came
in
throbs
and
the
colour
played
about
his
face
like
the
reflection
of
a
raging
fire
when
he
spoke
it
was
without
a
single
oath
all
his
uncleanness
had
dropped
away
from
him
as
though
he
recognised
its
threadbare
poverty
in
the
face
of
the
colossal
news
he
brought
gentlemen
he
said
leaning
forward
and
breathing
very
hard
you
would
have
it
and
you
have
got
your
way
you
made
oil
contraband
and
not
a
drop
can
be
landed
in
great
britain
now
it
ca
be
brought
but
it
can
be
used
when
it
is
here
and
the
unity
league
that
you
have
done
it
all
to
starve
has
got
two
hundred
million
gallons
safely
stowed
away
at
hanwood
yes
while
our
people
will
have
to
grope
and
freeze
through
the
winter
are
quite
comfortably
provided
for
and
you
whether
you
leave
the
bar
on
or
whether
you
take
it
off
you
have
made
us
the
of
europe
an
awed
silence
fell
on
the
group
not
the
most
shadowy
suspicion
of
such
a
miscarriage
had
ever
stirred
the
most
cautious
all
their
qualms
had
been
in
the
direction
of
swallowing
the
unpalatable
measure
not
of
doubting
its
efficacy
they
seemed
to
be
the
puny
antagonists
of
some
almost
superhuman
power
that
not
only
brushed
their
most
elaborate
plans
aside
but
actually
led
them
on
to
pave
the
way
to
their
own
undoing
mr
tubes
was
the
first
to
speak
it
ca
be
true
he
whispered
it
is
impossible
oh
everything
impossible
with
you
especially
when
it
happened
retorted
mr
bilch
contemptuously
pity
you
did
live
when
there
were
real
miracles
about
but
the
time
protested
some
one
how
could
they
do
it
in
the
time
time
said
mr
bilch
what
more
do
you
want
they
had
two
years
and
they
used
two
years
if
those
he
stopped
suddenly
jerked
his
head
twice
with
a
curious
motion
and
fell
to
the
ground
in
a
fit
there
were
plenty
of
good
friends
to
look
after
him
without
troubling
the
ministerial
group
the
broke
up
in
the
face
of
so
inauspicious
a
series
of
events
and
before
another
hour
had
passed
the
story
of
the
gigantic
fiasco
had
reached
every
club
in
london
and
was
being
cabled
to
every
capital
in
christendom
chapter
xvi
the
dark
winter
the
autumn
of
had
proved
unusually
mild
it
was
said
that
many
of
the
migratory
birds
delayed
their
exodus
for
weeks
beyond
their
normal
times
and
in
sheltered
gardens
and
hedgerows
in
the
south
of
england
flowers
and
fruit
were
making
an
untimely
show
but
about
midday
on
the
of
november
it
began
to
grow
dark
and
without
any
indication
of
fog
it
grew
darker
until
the
greater
part
of
england
and
wales
was
plunged
into
a
nocturnal
gloom
as
there
was
a
marked
fall
in
the
temperature
men
looked
up
to
the
clouds
and
predicted
snow
but
they
were
wrong
had
it
snowed
it
might
have
been
the
white
winter
of
for
that
night
the
frost
began
and
the
of
november
had
already
become
an
date
to
usher
in
a
frost
it
did
not
belie
its
character
the
next
day
broke
clear
but
bitter
and
those
who
read
newspapers
learned
with
curious
interest
that
during
the
night
the
comet
of
had
been
observed
by
several
astronomers
to
the
great
confusion
of
their
science
for
its
appearance
was
premature
by
a
round
hundred
thousand
years
the
phenomenon
afterwards
grew
into
a
portent
to
the
vulgar
mind
for
that
was
the
beginning
of
the
great
frost
that
lasted
seven
weeks
without
an
intermission
outside
certain
limits
life
was
proceeding
very
much
as
before
the
condition
of
the
upper
classes
was
not
materially
different
from
what
it
had
been
before
the
policy
of
retaliation
had
been
declared
the
personal
property
tax
had
not
been
proceeded
with
and
the
minimum
wage
bill
had
been
dropped
for
the
time
there
were
diplomatic
explanations
the
real
reason
was
that
the
cabinet
was
too
sharply
divided
over
the
expediency
of
anything
in
those
days
to
make
the
passing
of
important
measures
practicable
while
none
had
the
courage
to
go
to
an
extreme
either
in
aggression
or
in
conciliation
there
was
a
multitude
of
counsel
vehemently
wrangling
over
the
wisdom
of
little
concessions
and
little
aggressions
in
london
the
great
increase
in
the
number
of
unemployed
began
to
be
observable
in
the
early
autumn
the
obsolete
marches
of
unemployed
were
revived
but
as
might
have
been
foreseen
except
among
the
poor
themselves
they
met
with
no
financial
encouragement
even
the
poor
were
becoming
careful
of
their
pence
they
saw
what
the
winter
must
mean
for
every
one
knew
of
a
score
of
deserving
cases
around
his
own
door
and
it
was
commonly
reported
that
the
government
contemplated
reducing
the
unemployed
grant
to
its
normal
basis
before
the
year
was
out
that
was
the
cabinet
idea
for
breaking
it
gently
so
meeting
with
no
response
in
the
suburbs
the
city
or
the
west
end
the
processions
groaned
occasionally
broke
a
few
windows
enhanced
the
bitter
feeling
existing
against
their
class
by
frightening
more
than
a
few
ladies
and
were
finally
kept
in
check
by
the
special
constabulary
raised
in
the
suburbs
the
city
and
the
west
end
finding
so
little
profit
for
their
exertions
they
abandoned
their
indiscriminate
peregrinations
and
took
to
demonstrating
before
st
stephen
and
to
hooting
outside
the
houses
of
cabinet
ministers
until
the
processions
and
meetings
were
disallowed
there
was
no
public
charity
that
winter
either
organised
or
spontaneous
for
the
benefit
of
the
poor
the
conditions
of
labour
would
have
warranted
a
mansion
house
fund
being
opened
in
september
but
no
one
suggested
it
and
no
one
would
have
contributed
to
it
abroad
it
was
generally
recognised
that
england
was
involved
in
civil
war
to
which
it
behoved
them
to
act
as
neutrals
the
socialists
in
belgium
collected
and
despatched
the
sum
of
for
the
relief
of
their
persecuted
confraternity
in
england
but
as
the
pomp
and
circumstances
attending
the
inauguration
of
the
fund
had
led
their
persecuted
confraternity
in
england
to
expect
at
least
a
quarter
of
a
million
sterling
some
intemperate
remarks
greeted
the
consummation
of
the
effort
and
it
was
not
repeated
to
those
who
did
not
look
very
deeply
into
the
situation
it
appeared
that
a
long
hard
winter
must
operate
against
the
interests
of
the
league
their
opponents
would
burn
more
coal
the
government
indeed
issued
an
appeal
asking
them
to
do
so
and
thus
to
relieve
the
tension
in
the
provinces
the
response
was
not
promising
the
government
was
in
effect
told
to
mind
its
own
business
and
particularly
that
detail
of
its
business
which
consisted
in
the
guarantee
of
a
full
and
undocked
living
wage
to
every
worker
in
or
out
of
work
the
contention
so
far
had
been
that
with
the
surfeit
coal
would
be
so
cheap
that
even
the
poorest
could
burn
it
unstintingly
but
soon
a
new
and
rather
terrible
development
grew
out
of
the
complex
situation
coal
became
dear
not
only
dear
in
the
ordinary
sense
of
the
word
winter
prices
but
very
very
dear
the
simple
truth
was
that
a
disorganised
industry
always
moves
on
abnormal
lines
and
coal
was
a
routed
a
shattered
industry
there
was
no
oil
to
be
had
by
any
but
members
of
the
league
in
some
places
there
was
no
gas
to
be
had
for
many
of
the
small
gas
companies
and
some
of
the
large
ones
had
found
it
impossible
to
continue
amidst
the
dislocation
of
their
trade
and
the
cheapest
coal
was
being
retailed
in
the
streets
of
london
at
two
shillings
the
the
government
had
left
oil
contraband
after
the
discovery
of
the
secret
store
down
the
quiet
country
lane
for
they
recognised
that
to
remove
the
embargo
immediately
would
kill
them
with
ridicule
they
promised
themselves
that
the
freedom
of
commerce
should
be
restored
at
the
first
convenient
opportunity
in
the
meanwhile
they
decided
to
do
as
they
had
done
in
other
matters
they
bravely
ignored
the
fact
that
the
league
members
were
any
better
off
than
any
one
else
and
declined
to
believe
the
evidence
that
any
store
existed
that
was
the
state
of
affairs
before
the
winter
set
in
and
in
london
alone
the
capital
was
feeling
some
of
the
remoter
effects
of
the
blow
but
from
the
provinces
from
the
actual
there
came
grim
stories
northumberland
which
had
been
loth
to
accept
the
eight
hours
bill
now
traced
the
whole
of
the
trouble
to
that
head
and
declared
that
the
only
hope
was
for
the
government
to
make
a
complete
surrender
to
the
unity
league
on
the
one
condition
that
it
restored
a
normal
demand
for
coal
both
at
home
and
abroad
durham
on
the
contrary
held
that
it
was
necessary
for
the
government
to
crush
or
wear
out
the
league
in
both
counties
there
had
been
fierce
conflict
between
the
rival
factions
and
blood
had
been
freely
shed
after
a
single
rioting
at
newcastle
and
gateshead
seventeen
dead
bodies
had
been
collected
by
the
ambulances
the
beaconmen
in
glamorgan
were
setting
fire
to
the
pits
themselves
in
a
spirit
of
fanaticism
in
one
instance
a
fire
had
spread
beyond
the
intended
limits
and
an
explosion
in
which
three
score
of
their
unfortunate
perished
had
been
the
net
result
the
midlands
were
the
least
disturbed
and
even
there
walsall
had
seen
a
mass
meeting
at
which
thirty
thousand
colliers
and
other
affected
workmen
had
called
insistently
with
threats
upon
the
government
in
pathetic
ignorance
of
the
treasury
plight
to
purchase
the
coal
pits
at
once
and
resume
full
time
at
all
of
them
as
the
only
means
of
averting
a
national
calamity
and
all
this
had
been
taking
place
in
the
mild
autumn
while
the
government
was
still
paying
out
sufficient
relief
funds
to
ensure
that
actual
starvation
should
not
touch
any
one
long
before
it
had
been
driven
to
take
the
country
into
its
confidence
the
spectre
of
cold
and
hunger
had
not
yet
been
raised
to
goad
the
men
to
madness
so
far
they
regarded
existence
at
least
as
assured
and
the
question
that
was
stirring
them
to
rebellion
was
not
the
fundamental
one
of
the
right
to
live
but
the
almost
academic
issue
of
the
right
to
live
apart
from
the
natural
vicissitudes
of
life
the
government
had
other
troubles
on
hand
the
two
principal
causes
for
anxiety
among
these
if
not
actually
of
their
own
hatching
had
certainly
sprung
from
a
common
stock
the
parliament
sitting
at
college
green
deemed
the
moment
opportune
for
issuing
a
declaration
of
independence
and
proclaiming
a
republic
three
years
before
all
irishmen
had
been
withdrawn
from
the
british
army
and
navy
on
the
receipt
of
dublin
note
to
the
effect
that
since
the
granting
of
extended
home
rule
irishmen
came
within
the
sphere
of
the
foreign
enlistment
act
these
men
formed
the
nucleus
of
a
very
useful
army
with
which
ireland
thought
it
would
be
practicable
to
hold
out
in
the
interior
until
foreign
intervention
came
to
its
aid
possibly
england
thought
so
too
for
mr
strummery
ministry
contented
itself
with
issuing
what
its
members
described
as
a
firm
and
dignified
protest
closely
examined
it
was
discoverable
that
the
dignified
portion
was
a
lengthy
recapitulation
of
ancient
history
the
firm
portion
a
record
of
dublin
demands
since
home
rule
had
been
conceded
while
the
essential
part
of
the
communication
informed
the
new
republic
that
its
actions
were
not
what
his
majesty
ministers
had
expected
of
it
and
that
they
would
certainly
reserve
the
right
of
taking
the
matter
in
hand
at
some
future
time
more
suitable
to
themselves
the
other
harassment
was
that
leicester
lay
at
the
mercy
of
an
epidemic
of
which
threatened
to
become
historic
in
the
annals
of
the
scourge
in
the
second
month
the
average
daily
number
of
deaths
had
risen
to
and
there
was
no
sign
of
a
decrease
in
the
autumn
it
was
hoped
that
the
winter
would
kill
the
disease
in
the
winter
it
was
anticipated
that
it
would
die
out
naturally
under
the
influence
of
the
spring
sunshine
the
situation
affected
mr
chadwing
more
closely
than
any
of
his
colleagues
for
leicester
had
the
honour
of
returning
the
chancellor
of
the
exchequer
as
one
of
its
members
under
normal
conditions
mr
chadwing
made
a
practice
of
visiting
his
constituency
and
addressing
a
meeting
every
few
weeks
but
during
the
six
months
that
the
epidemic
raged
he
found
himself
unable
to
leave
london
his
attitude
was
perfectly
consistent
in
spite
of
the
hard
things
that
some
of
his
supporters
said
of
him
in
his
absence
like
the
majority
of
his
constituents
he
had
a
conscientious
objection
to
vaccination
but
he
also
had
an
even
stronger
conscientious
objection
to
encountering
infection
the
of
november
ushered
in
a
new
phase
of
the
strife
it
marked
the
beginning
of
the
dark
winter
early
in
december
the
newspapers
began
to
draw
comparisons
between
the
weather
then
prevailing
and
the
hard
winters
on
record
at
that
date
it
was
noticeable
how
many
vagrants
were
to
be
seen
walking
aimlessly
about
the
streets
of
london
the
unemployed
from
the
country
were
beginning
to
flock
in
for
the
mere
sense
of
warmth
the
british
museum
cathedral
the
free
libraries
and
other
places
where
it
was
possible
to
escape
from
the
dreadful
rigour
of
the
streets
were
crowded
by
day
at
night
long
of
miserable
creatures
haunted
the
grids
of
restaurants
the
sheltered
sides
of
theatres
the
windows
of
printing
houses
and
any
spot
where
a
little
warmth
exhaled
on
the
nights
of
the
the
and
the
of
december
the
thermometer
on
primrose
hill
registered
below
zero
on
the
pheasants
were
observed
feeding
among
the
pigeons
in
the
main
street
of
highgate
and
from
that
time
onwards
wild
birds
of
the
rarer
kinds
were
no
unusual
sight
in
the
london
parks
and
about
the
public
buildings
in
the
country
it
was
remarked
that
the
small
birds
had
begun
to
disappear
and
the
curious
might
read
any
morning
of
frozen
goldfinches
being
picked
up
in
camberwell
larks
about
victoria
park
and
starlings
robins
blackbirds
and
such
like
fry
everywhere
by
this
time
dairymen
had
discovered
that
it
was
impossible
to
deliver
milk
unless
they
carried
a
brazier
of
live
charcoal
on
their
cart
or
local
correspondents
in
the
provinces
had
ceased
to
report
ordinary
cases
of
death
from
cold
and
exposure
there
were
cases
in
the
streets
of
london
every
night
early
in
december
sir
john
hampden
was
approached
unofficially
by
a
few
members
of
parliament
including
one
or
two
of
minor
official
rank
to
learn
his
terms
the
suggestions
were
tentative
on
both
sides
and
nothing
was
stated
definitely
but
out
of
the
circumlocution
it
might
be
inferred
that
he
expressed
his
willingness
to
rescind
the
boycott
and
to
devote
five
million
pounds
to
public
relief
at
once
in
return
for
certain
modifications
of
the
franchise
and
an
immediate
dissolution
nothing
came
of
the
movement
and
during
the
first
week
of
december
the
government
sent
round
to
the
and
to
all
the
crown
tax
collectors
notices
that
the
licences
ordinarily
falling
due
on
the
of
january
must
be
taken
out
on
or
before
the
of
the
current
month
and
the
king
taxes
similarly
collected
in
advance
the
league
did
not
make
any
open
comment
on
this
departure
but
every
member
merely
ignored
it
and
when
the
of
december
was
reached
it
devolved
upon
the
officers
of
the
crown
to
enforce
the
payment
by
legal
process
in
the
language
of
another
age
the
government
was
faced
by
five
million
passive
resisters
it
soon
became
apparent
that
instead
of
getting
in
the
taxes
a
fortnight
before
their
time
the
greater
part
of
the
revenue
from
that
source
would
be
delayed
at
least
a
month
later
than
usual
on
the
of
december
one
million
and
unemployed
of
various
grades
presented
themselves
at
the
appointed
trades
unions
committee
rooms
workhouse
offices
employment
bureaux
treasury
depôts
from
which
the
fund
was
administered
to
receive
their
weekly
wage
as
they
passed
in
they
were
confronted
by
a
formal
notice
to
the
effect
that
the
disbursement
was
then
reduced
to
half
its
usual
amount
as
they
passed
out
they
came
upon
another
formal
notice
to
the
effect
that
after
the
following
week
the
grant
would
be
temporarily
suspended
possibly
that
also
embodied
an
idea
of
breaking
it
gently
the
cry
of
surprise
rage
and
terrified
foreboding
that
rose
from
every
town
and
village
of
the
land
when
the
direful
news
was
at
length
understood
can
never
be
described
its
echoes
were
destined
to
roll
through
the
pages
of
english
history
for
many
a
generation
the
immediate
result
was
that
rioting
broke
out
in
practically
all
parts
of
the
country
except
the
purely
agricultural
the
people
who
had
been
promised
a
perpetual
life
of
milk
and
honey
had
murmured
when
they
were
offered
bread
and
water
now
there
seemed
every
prospect
of
the
water
reaching
them
as
ice
and
the
being
empty
and
their
murmuring
took
a
sharper
edge
in
some
places
there
were
absolute
stampedes
of
reason
in
justice
it
has
to
be
remembered
that
by
this
time
the
most
pitiless
winter
of
modern
times
had
been
heaping
misery
on
misery
for
a
month
that
the
chance
of
finding
work
or
relief
was
recognised
to
be
the
forlornest
hope
and
that
very
very
few
had
a
reserve
of
any
kind
the
indiscriminate
disturbances
of
the
of
december
were
easily
suppressed
a
people
that
has
been
free
for
generations
loses
the
gift
for
successful
rioting
in
the
face
of
armed
discipline
even
of
the
most
inadequate
strength
but
for
constitutional
purposes
the
body
of
one
dragooned
rioter
in
england
was
worth
more
than
a
whole
battue
east
of
the
baltic
on
the
of
december
the
certified
unemployed
drew
their
diminished
pittance
for
the
last
time
they
left
the
buildings
in
many
places
with
the
significant
threat
that
they
would
return
that
day
week
and
if
there
was
nothing
for
them
would
warm
their
hands
there
at
the
least
there
was
renewed
rioting
that
day
also
the
forces
of
law
and
order
had
been
strengthened
the
rioters
appeared
to
have
been
better
organised
in
one
or
two
towns
the
rioting
began
to
approach
the
continental
level
bolton
was
said
to
have
proved
itself
far
from
amateurish
and
nuneaton
was
spoken
of
as
being
distinctly
promising
at
the
end
of
that
day
public
buildings
had
to
be
requisitioned
in
several
places
to
lay
out
the
spoils
of
victory
and
defeat
two
days
later
every
newspaper
contained
an
open
letter
from
sir
john
hampden
to
the
government
in
which
he
unconditionally
offered
them
on
behalf
of
the
unity
league
and
in
the
name
of
humanity
sufficient
funds
to
pay
the
half
grant
for
four
weeks
longer
it
was
a
humane
offer
but
its
proper
name
was
strategy
it
embarrassed
the
government
to
decide
whether
to
accept
or
decline
it
embarrassed
them
if
they
accepted
and
if
they
declined
it
embarrassed
them
most
of
all
they
declined
or
to
be
precise
they
ignored
the
offer
by
this
time
england
might
be
said
to
be
under
famine
london
in
its
straits
began
curiously
to
assume
the
appearance
of
a
mediæval
city
by
night
one
might
meet
grotesquely
clad
bands
of
revellers
returning
from
some
ice
carnival
for
the
thames
had
long
been
frozen
from
the
tower
to
gravesend
by
the
light
of
lanterns
and
torches
which
they
carried
none
but
those
who
had
nothing
to
lose
ventured
out
into
the
streets
at
night
except
by
companies
thieves
and
bludgeoners
lurked
in
every
archway
and
arrests
were
seldom
made
beggars
importuned
with
every
wile
and
in
every
tone
and
new
fantastic
creeds
and
extravagant
new
parties
sent
out
their
perfervid
disciples
to
proclaim
utopias
at
every
corner
to
add
to
the
terror
of
the
night
there
suddenly
sprang
into
prominence
the
bands
of
running
madmen
who
swept
through
the
streets
like
fallen
leaves
in
an
autumn
gale
barefooted
gaunt
and
wildly
dressed
in
rags
they
broke
upon
the
astonished
wayfarer
sight
and
passed
out
again
into
the
gloom
before
he
could
ask
himself
what
strange
manner
of
men
they
were
never
alone
seldom
exceeding
a
score
in
any
band
they
ran
keenly
as
though
with
some
purposeful
end
in
view
for
the
most
part
silently
but
now
and
then
startling
the
quiet
night
with
an
inarticulate
wail
or
a
cry
of
woe
or
lamentation
but
they
turned
from
street
to
street
in
aimless
intricacy
and
sought
no
definite
goal
they
were
never
seen
by
day
and
whence
they
came
or
where
they
had
their
homes
none
could
say
but
the
steady
increase
in
the
number
of
their
bands
showed
that
they
were
undoubtedly
the
victims
of
a
contagious
mania
such
as
those
that
have
appeared
in
the
past
from
time
to
time
almost
as
ragged
and
unkempt
was
the
army
that
by
day
marched
under
the
standard
of
brother
ambrose
towards
the
sinless
new
jerusalem
reading
the
abundant
signs
all
round
with
an
inspired
and
fatalistic
eye
ambrose
uncompromisingly
announced
that
all
the
portents
of
the
millennium
were
now
fulfilled
and
that
the
reign
of
temporal
power
on
earth
was
at
an
end
each
day
his
eloquence
mounted
to
a
wilder
flight
each
day
he
dreamed
new
dreams
and
saw
fresh
visions
and
promised
to
his
followers
more
definitely
the
spoil
of
victory
and
parcelled
out
the
smiling
fruitful
land
drawn
by
every
human
passion
recruits
poured
into
his
ranks
and
when
he
marched
in
tattered
state
to
mark
the
boundaries
of
the
impending
golden
city
the
legions
of
the
chosen
rolled
not
in
their
thousands
but
in
their
tens
of
thousands
singing
hymns
and
interspersing
ribaldry
a
very
different
spectacle
was
afforded
by
the
bands
of
the
gilded
youth
which
by
day
patrolled
the
approaches
to
houses
of
the
better
class
wherever
smoke
had
been
seen
issuing
from
the
chimneys
and
by
night
with
equal
order
and
thoroughness
turned
out
the
public
gas
lamps
in
the
streets
until
many
of
the
authorities
at
last
gave
up
the
lighting
of
the
lamps
as
a
useless
formality
it
was
impossible
for
the
occupants
of
a
house
that
had
incurred
their
enmity
to
have
them
removed
by
force
or
to
maintain
an
attitude
of
unconcern
in
the
face
of
their
demonstration
yet
everything
they
did
came
under
the
term
of
peaceful
picketing
within
the
provisions
of
the
act
and
an
attempt
to
fix
responsibility
upon
the
unity
league
for
the
action
of
its
agents
in
a
few
cases
where
the
gilded
youth
had
gone
beyond
their
powers
failed
ignominiously
through
the
precedent
afforded
by
the
final
settlement
of
the
celebrated
tawe
valley
case
in
the
provinces
the
rioters
were
burning
coal
burning
smashing
machinery
and
destroying
property
indiscriminately
blind
to
the
fact
that
some
of
the
immediate
effects
were
falling
on
their
and
that
most
of
the
ultimate
effects
would
fall
upon
themselves
in
london
and
elsewhere
the
bands
of
the
gilded
youth
were
going
quietly
and
systematically
about
their
daily
work
peacefully
terrorising
into
submission
and
carefully
turning
out
the
public
lamps
at
night
as
soon
as
they
were
lit
to
the
reflective
mind
it
was
rather
a
dreadful
power
that
the
time
had
called
into
being
an
educated
mob
that
rioted
peacefully
and
did
nothing
at
all
that
was
detrimental
to
its
own
interest
each
morning
people
assured
one
another
that
so
unparalleled
a
frost
could
last
no
longer
but
each
night
the
air
seemed
to
be
whetted
to
a
keener
edge
and
each
day
there
came
fresh
evidences
of
its
power
early
in
january
it
was
computed
that
all
the
small
birds
that
had
not
taken
refuge
in
towns
were
dead
partly
through
the
cold
itself
but
equally
by
starvation
for
the
ground
yielded
them
nothing
and
the
trees
and
shrubs
upon
which
they
had
been
able
to
rely
for
food
in
former
winters
had
long
since
perished
there
were
none
but
insignificant
hollies
to
be
seen
in
english
gardens
for
the
next
generation
and
in
exposed
situations
forest
trees
and
even
oaks
were
split
down
to
the
ground
all
this
time
there
was
very
little
destructive
rioting
going
on
in
london
on
any
organised
scale
but
every
night
breadths
of
wood
pavement
were
torn
up
by
the
homeless
vagrants
who
were
now
allowed
to
herd
where
they
could
and
great
fires
set
burning
at
which
the
police
warmed
themselves
and
mingled
supinely
with
the
crowd
by
day
the
police
went
in
pairs
by
night
they
patrolled
in
companies
of
five
for
the
emergency
of
serious
rioting
the
military
were
always
kept
in
readiness
against
the
more
ordinary
depredations
on
private
property
the
owners
were
practically
left
to
defend
themselves
in
those
dark
weeks
watch
duty
became
one
of
the
regular
occupations
among
the
staff
of
every
london
business
and
short
shrift
was
given
to
intruders
inquests
went
like
marriages
in
busy
churches
at
in
batches
and
the
morning
cart
that
picked
up
the
frozen
dead
had
only
one
compartment
the
time
was
past
when
the
effects
of
the
vast
disorganisation
could
be
localised
every
trade
and
profession
every
trivial
and
obscure
calling
and
every
insignificant
little
offshoot
of
that
great
trunk
called
commerce
was
involved
in
depression
it
was
not
too
much
to
say
that
every
individual
in
the
land
was
feeling
some
ill
effect
frantic
legislation
had
begun
it
ten
years
before
the
coal
war
had
brought
it
to
a
climax
and
the
grip
of
the
long
hard
winter
had
pressed
like
a
hostile
hand
upon
the
land
it
had
resolved
itself
into
a
war
of
endurance
coal
was
no
longer
the
pivot
it
was
money
immediate
money
with
which
to
buy
bread
at
the
bakers
shops
where
they
carried
on
their
trade
with
the
shutters
up
and
loaded
weapons
laid
out
in
the
upper
rooms
not
the
least
curious
feature
of
the
struggle
was
the
marked
disinclination
of
the
starving
populace
to
pillage
or
bloodshed
doubtless
they
saw
that
whatever
they
might
individually
profit
by
a
reign
of
terror
their
cause
and
party
had
nothing
to
gain
from
it
such
an
outburst
must
inevitably
react
unfavourably
upon
the
government
of
the
day
and
it
was
party
then
in
power
but
they
had
not
the
mob
instinct
in
them
they
were
not
composed
of
the
ordinary
mob
element
in
the
bulk
they
were
neither
criminals
nor
hooligans
but
disillusionised
working
men
and
the
instincts
of
their
class
have
ever
been
steady
and
in
cheapside
a
gang
of
professional
thieves
blew
out
the
iron
shutter
of
a
jeweller
shop
with
dynamite
and
securing
a
valuable
haul
of
jewellery
in
the
momentary
confusion
sought
to
hide
themselves
among
the
mob
far
from
entering
into
their
aspirations
the
mob
promptly
conveyed
them
to
the
nearest
police
station
and
returned
to
the
owner
the
valuable
articles
that
had
been
scattered
about
the
street
the
climax
of
the
incident
was
reached
by
half
a
dozen
of
the
most
stalwart
unemployed
gladly
accepting
a
few
shillings
each
to
guard
the
broken
window
until
the
shutter
was
repaired
at
the
collieries
the
mills
the
workshops
and
the
seats
of
labour
there
were
outrages
against
property
but
away
from
the
immediate
centres
there
was
neither
cupidity
nor
resentment
whenever
disturbances
of
the
kind
took
place
they
were
invariably
in
pursuit
of
food
or
warmth
the
men
were
dispirited
and
by
this
time
they
regarded
their
cause
as
lost
their
leaders
in
and
out
of
parliament
were
classed
either
as
incompetent
generals
in
a
war
or
as
traitors
who
had
misled
the
people
the
people
only
asked
them
now
to
make
the
terms
of
surrender
so
that
they
might
live
and
they
did
not
hesitate
to
declare
roundly
that
the
old
times
when
they
had
had
to
look
after
themselves
more
and
had
not
been
body
and
soul
at
the
disposal
of
unions
were
preferable
on
the
whole
the
position
of
the
cabinet
was
daily
growing
more
critical
its
chiefs
were
execrated
and
insulted
whenever
they
were
seen
all
the
approaches
to
the
house
were
held
by
military
guards
and
the
members
reached
its
gates
singly
and
almost
by
stealth
every
day
placards
written
and
printed
were
found
displayed
in
public
places
calling
on
the
government
that
had
no
money
to
let
in
one
that
had
you
thought
more
of
your
position
than
of
our
needs
when
hampden
offered
us
help
ran
one
that
mr
strummery
found
nailed
to
his
front
door
you
have
always
thought
more
of
your
positions
than
of
our
needs
you
have
used
our
needs
to
raise
yourselves
to
those
positions
now
since
you
no
longer
represent
the
wishes
of
the
people
give
way
to
others
the
delay
of
the
government
in
throwing
up
an
utterly
untenable
position
was
inexplicable
to
most
people
many
said
that
the
reason
was
that
hampden
refused
to
take
office
under
the
existing
franchise
and
no
one
but
hampden
could
form
an
administration
in
that
crisis
that
could
hope
to
live
for
a
day
whatever
the
reason
might
be
it
was
obvious
that
the
government
was
drifting
towards
a
national
tragedy
that
would
be
stupendous
for
in
less
than
a
month
time
it
was
agreed
on
all
hands
the
daily
tale
of
starved
and
famished
dead
would
have
reached
its
thousands
still
the
government
hung
on
backed
in
sullen
submission
by
its
automatic
majority
changes
in
the
cabinet
were
of
almost
daily
record
but
the
half
dozen
men
of
prominence
remained
cecil
brown
was
the
last
of
the
old
minor
men
to
be
dropped
a
dog
trainer
who
had
taken
up
politics
succeeded
him
it
is
too
late
now
cecil
brown
was
reported
to
have
said
when
he
learned
who
was
to
be
his
successor
they
want

chapter
xvii
the
incident
of
the
of
january
i
do
not
altogether
like
it
said
a
do
you
prefer
to
leave
things
as
they
are
then
demanded
b
went
over
and
stood
by
the
window
looking
moodily
out
it
is
merely
a
necessity
said
the
necessity
of
a
necessity
suggested
happily
perhaps
you
are
not
aware
said
addressing
himself
to
the
man
standing
at
the
window
that
the
suggestion
of
arresting
salt
did
not
come
from
us
in
the
first
case
is
that
so
replied
coming
back
into
the
room
i
certainly
assumed
that
it
did
on
the
contrary
explained
it
was
inspector
moeletter
who
reported
to
his
superiors
that
he
had
succeeded
in
identifying
the
mysterious
man
who
was
seen
with
leslie
garnet
the
artist
about
the
time
of
his
death
he
would
have
got
his
warrant
in
the
ordinary
way
only
in
view
of
the
remarkable
position
that
salt
occupies
just
now
stafford
very
naturally
communicated
with
us
the
only
point
that
troubles
us
remarked
reflectively
is
that
none
of
us
can
persuade
himself
in
the
remotest
degree
that
salt
killed
garnet
i
certainty
require
to
have
the
evidence
before
i
can
subscribe
to
that
said
b
the
man
who
is
daily
killing
hundreds
ah
that
is
the
difference
commented
where
are
the
monmouth
colliers
now
asked
after
a
pause
newbury
this
morning
replied
reading
and
the
midland
lot
towcester
i
think
if
hampden
formally
asks
for
protection
for
the
oil
store
at
hanwood
after
the
miners
threat
to
burn
it
what
are
you
going
to
do
asked
a
i
should
suggest
telling
him
to
go
and
boil
himself
in
it
since
he
has
got
it
there
replied
there
will
be
no
need
to
tell
him
anything
but
the
bare
fact
and
that
is
that
with
thousand
turbulent
colliers
pouring
into
london
and
adding
to
the
disaffected
element
already
here
we
can
not
spare
a
single
man
replied
b
i
quite
agree
with
that
remarked
drawing
attention
to
his
cheek
i
had
a
tribute
of
the
mob
affection
as
i
came
in
this
morning
that
your
popularity
said
your
photograph
is
so
much
about
that
no
one
has
any
difficulty
in
recognising
you
how
do
you
get
on
in
that
way
i
exclaimed
with
a
startled
look
oh
i
always
drive
with
the
blinds
down
now
are
any
extra
military
coming
in
before
friday
asked
a
yes
the
lancers
from
hounslow
they
come
into
the
empty
albany
street
barracks
then
i
think
that
there
are
to
be
some
extra
infantry
in
whitehall
from
aldershot
cadman
is
seeing
to
all
that
but
you
know
that
the
lancers
are
being
drawn
from
hounslow
asked
with
a
meaning
laugh
yes
i
know
that
admitted
b
why
do
you
laugh
only
reply
was
to
laugh
again
i
will
tell
you
why
he
laughs
volunteered
he
laughs
because
the
lancers
withdrawn
from
hounslow
to
regent
park
salt
under
arrest
at
stafford
and
the
monmouth
colliers
coming
along
the
bath
road
and
passing
within
a
mile
or
two
of
hanwood
represent
the
three
angles
of
a
very
acute
triangle
there
is
still
hampden
muttered
b
yes
what
is
going
to
happen
to
hampden
asked
with
a
trace
of
his
mordant
amusement
who
was
walking
about
the
room
aimlessly
stopped
and
faced
the
others
i
tell
you
what
he
exclaimed
emphatically
i
said
just
now
that
i
did
like
the
idea
of
smuggling
salt
away
like
this
and
although
it
may
be
advisable
i
do
but
i
wish
to
god
that
we
had
openly
arrested
the
pair
of
them
as
traitors
and
burned
their
diabolical
store
before
every
one
eyes
three
months
ago
ah
said
thoughtfully
it
was
too
early
then
now
it
too
late
it
may
be
too
late
to
have
its
full
effect
flashed
out
but
it
wo
be
too
late
to
make
them
suffer
a
bit
along
with
our
own
people
provided
that
the
oil
is
burned
said
provided
that
no
protection
can
be
sent
remarked
provided
that
salt
is
arrested
added
a
there
was
a
knock
at
the
door
it
explained
the
attitude
of
the
four
men
in
the
room
and
their
scattered
conversation
they
had
been
awaiting
some
one
he
came
into
the
room
and
saluted
a
man
with
uniform
branded
on
every
limb
although
he
wore
plain
clothes
then
moeletter
said
b
yes
sir
said
the
inspector
and
stood
at
attention
you
have
the
warrant
continued
moeletter
produced
it
and
passed
it
in
for
inspection
it
was
made
out
on
the
preceding
day
signed
by
the
stipendiary
magistrate
of
stafford
and
it
connected
george
salt
with
leslie
garnet
by
the
link
of
murder
when
you
applied
for
this
warrant
said
looking
hard
at
the
inspector
you
considered
that
you
had
sufficient
evidence
to
support
it
moeletter
looked
puzzled
for
a
moment
as
though
the
question
was
one
that
he
did
not
quite
follow
in
that
form
for
a
moment
he
seemed
to
be
on
the
verge
of
making
an
explanation
then
he
thought
better
of
it
and
simply
replied
yes
sir
at
all
events
continued
hastily
you
have
enough
evidence
to
justify
a
remand
what
are
the
points
we
have
abundant
evidence
that
salt
was
in
the
neighbourhood
about
the
time
of
the
tragedy
that
fact
can
scarcely
be
contested
coming
nearer
an
old
man
who
had
been
hedging
until
the
storm
drove
him
under
a
high
bank
saw
a
gentleman
enter
garnet
cottage
about
five
without
any
leading
he
described
this
man
accurately
as
salt
and
picked
out
his
photograph
from
among
a
dozen
others
about
an
hour
later
two
boys
who
were
near
stourton
hill
church
heard
a
shot
they
looked
through
the
hedge
into
the
graveyard
and
saw
one
man
lying
apparently
dead
on
the
ground
and
another
bending
over
him
as
though
he
might
be
going
through
his
pockets
being
frightened
they
ran
away
and
told
no
one
of
it
for
some
time
as
boys
would
of
course
sir
more
than
six
months
ago
now
but
the
description
they
give
tallies
and
i
think
that
we
may
claim
a
strong
presumption
of
identity
taking
into
consideration
the
established
time
of
salt
arrival
at
thornley
that
is
all
said
b
as
regards
identity
replied
the
inspector
on
general
grounds
we
shall
show
that
for
some
time
before
his
death
garnet
had
been
selling
shares
and
securities
which
he
held
and
that
although
he
lived
frugally
no
money
was
found
in
the
remains
of
his
house
or
on
his
person
and
no
trace
of
a
banking
account
or
other
investment
can
be
discovered
then
we
allege
that
salt
is
not
the
man
right
name
although
we
have
not
been
able
to
follow
that
up
yet
he
is
generally
understood
to
have
been
a
sailor
recently
and
the
revolver
found
beside
the
body
was
of
a
naval
pattern
i
should
add
that
the
medical
evidence
at
the
inquest
was
to
the
effect
that
the
wound
might
have
been
but
that
the
angle
was
unusual
returned
the
warrant
to
the
inspector
that
will
at
least
ensure
a
remand
for
a
week
for
you
to
continue
your
investigations
i
think
so
sir
without
bail
if
it
is
opposed
we
oppose
it
then
did
you
bring
any
one
down
with
you
inspector
moeletter
had
not
done
so
he
had
not
been
able
to
anticipate
what
amended
instructions
he
might
receive
in
london
so
he
had
thought
it
as
well
to
come
alone
for
political
reasons
it
is
desirable
that
nothing
should
be
known
publicly
of
the
arrest
until
you
have
your
prisoner
safely
at
stafford
said
b
at
present
he
is
motoring
in
the
southern
counties
i
have
information
that
he
will
leave
farnham
this
afternoon
between
three
and
and
proceed
direct
to
guildford
is
there
any
reason
why
you
should
not
arrest
him
between
the
two
places
inspector
moeletter
knew
of
none
it
will
be
preferable
to
doing
so
in
either
town
from
our
point
of
view
continued
and
it
is
not
known
whether
he
intends
leaving
guildford
the
inspector
took
out
an
whose
elastic
band
was
a
veritable
hangman
noose
and
noted
the
facts
is
a
description
of
the
available
he
enquired
picked
up
a
sheet
of
paper
it
is
a
large
car
a
daimler
with
a
covered
body
and
painted
in
two
shades
of
green
he
read
from
the
paper
the
number
is
i
would
suggest
bringing
him
straight
on
in
the
car
said
moeletter
it
would
obviate
the
publicity
of
railway
travelling
nodded
there
is
another
thing
he
said
it
is
absolutely
necessary
to
avoid
the
london
termini
they
are
all
watched
systematically
by
agents
of
the
league
spies
who
call
themselves
patriots
you
will
take
the
train
with
your
prisoner
but
you
will
join
it
at
willesden
i
will
have
it
stopped
for
you
i
shall
need
a
man
who
can
drive
the
motor
to
go
down
with
me
the
detective
reminded
him
struck
a
bell
send
sergeant
tolkeith
in
he
said
to
the
attendant
sergeant
tolkeith
was
apparently
being
kept
ready
in
the
next
room
to
be
slipped
at
the
fall
of
the
flag
so
to
speak
he
came
in
very
smartly
you
will
remain
with
inspector
moeletter
while
he
is
in
london
and
make
all
the
necessary
arrangements
for
him
instructed
b
i
suppose
that
there
are
men
at
scotland
yard
available
now
who
can
drive
every
kind
of
motor
sergeant
tolkeith
hazarded
the
opinion
that
there
were
men
at
scotland
yard
at
that
moment
who
could
drive
he
looked
round
the
room
in
search
of
some
strange
or
titanic
vehicle
to
which
the
prowess
of
scotland
yard
would
be
equal
well
anything
a
man
who
knows
the
roads
continued
b
though
for
that
matter
a
simple
enough
route
the
portsmouth
road
all
the
way
to
kingston
and
then
across
to
willesden
you
had
better
avoid
guildford
by
the
way
coming
back
now
what
other
assistance
will
you
require
how
many
are
there
likely
to
be
in
the
car
sir
no
one
but
salt
i
am
informed
he
has
been
touring
alone
for
a
week
past
at
all
events
in
that
case
sir
we
had
better
take
a
couple
of
men
from
guildford
and
drive
towards
farnham
we
can
wait
at
a
suitable
place
in
the
road
and
make
the
arrest
then
when
the
irons
are
on
i
shall
need
no
one
beyond
the
driver
i
take
with
me
the
two
local
men
you
want
mr
salt
detained
for
a
few
hours
i
suppose
sir
yes
certainly
until
you
are
well
on
your
way
and
any
one
else
who
may
happen
to
be
in
the
car
i
will
give
you
authority
covering
that
the
two
local
men
can
take
him
or
them
back
to
guildford
it
will
be
dark
by
the
time
they
get
there
for
detention
while
enquiries
are
being
made
then
if
a
man
meets
me
at
willesden
we
can
go
on
and
our
driver
can
take
the
car
on
to
scotland
yard
you
see
no
difficulty
throughout
said
anxiously
the
inspector
assured
him
that
all
seemed
plain
sailing
it
was
not
his
place
to
foresee
difficulties
in
b
plans
then
i
shall
expect
you
to
report
to
me
from
stafford
about
that
everything
is
satisfactory
let
me
impress
on
you
as
a
last
word
the
need
of
care
and
in
this
case
it
must
be
successfully
carried
out
and
to
do
that
there
must
be
no
fuss
or
publicity
sergeant
said
moeletter
when
they
were
outside
between
ourselves
can
you
tell
me
this
why
they
think
it
necessary
to
have
three
mute
gentlemen
looking
on
while
we
arrange
a
matter
of
this
sort
between
ourselves
sir
replied
sergeant
tolkeith
looking
cautiously
around
it
my
belief
that
it
come
to
this
that
they
are
all
of
themselves
and
ca
trust
one
another
remarked
as
they
left
together
a
few
minutes
later
does
anything
strike
you
about
it
strikes
me
that
he
looks
rather
like
an
undertaker
man
when
he
is
dressed
up
replied
does
it
not
strike
you
that
he
is
oh
admitted
stroking
his
wounded
cheek
that
quite
possible
so
am
i
for
that
matter
so
may
we
all
be
in
a
way
said
but
it
is
different
with
him
i
believe
that
he
is
in
a
he
fey
and
he
got
salt
on
the
brain
just
remember
that
i
venture
on
this
prophecy
if
salt
through
any
cause
does
not
happen
to
get
arrested
will
throw
up
the
sponge
the
office
of
the
unity
league
in
trafalgar
chambers
was
little
more
than
an
empty
hive
now
the
headquarters
of
the
operations
had
been
transferred
to
the
colony
at
hanwood
and
most
of
the
staff
had
followed
with
the
declaration
of
the
coal
war
an
entirely
different
set
of
conditions
had
come
into
force
the
old
offices
had
practically
become
a
clearing
house
for
everything
connected
with
the
league
and
the
high
tide
of
active
interest
swept
on
elsewhere
miss
lisle
remained
a
person
of
some
consequence
but
in
her
heart
she
sighed
from
time
to
time
for
a
sphere
of
action
down
another
little
lane
on
the
afternoon
of
the
of
january
she
returned
to
the
office
about
three
and
going
to
the
instrument
room
unlocked
the
telescribe
and
proceeded
to
sort
the
dozen
communications
which
it
contained
the
accumulation
of
an
hour
before
passing
them
on
to
be
dealt
with
most
fell
into
departments
at
a
glance
it
was
not
until
she
reached
the
last
the
earliest
sent
that
she
read
it
through
but
as
she
read
that
her
whole
mechanical
manner
changed
with
the
first
line
apathy
fell
from
her
like
a
cloak
before
she
had
finished
every
limb
and
feature
conveyed
a
sense
of
tingling
excitement
in
frantic
haste
she
dragged
the
special
writing
materials
across
the
table
towards
her
dashed
off
a
sprawling
stop
mr
salt
at
any
lisle
and
flashed
it
off
to
the
league
agency
at
farnham
a
couple
of
minutes
must
pass
before
she
could
get
any
reply
she
picked
up
the
cause
of
her
excitement
and
for
the
second
time
read
the
message
it
contained
if
you
want
to
keep
your
mr
salt
from
being
arrested
on
a
charge
of
murder
warn
him
that
inspector
moeletter
from
stafford
will
be
waiting
for
him
on
the
road
between
farnham
and
guildford
at
three
this
afternoon
with
a
warrant
no
one
believes
in
it
but
he
will
be
taken
on
in
his
motor
to
willesden
and
on
to
stafford
by
the
and
kept
out
of
the
way
for
a
week
while
things
have
time
to
happen
at
hanwood
there
will
be
just
enough
evidence
to
get
a
remand
as
there
was
to
get
a
warrant
this
is
from
a
friend
who
may
remind
you
of
it
later
and
prove
who
he
is
by
this
sign
the
letter
finished
with
a
rough
drawing
of
a
gallows
and
a
broken
rope
it
was
written
in
a
cramped
feigned
hand
and
addressed
to
sir
john
hampden
it
might
have
been
lying
in
the
box
for
an
hour
the
telescribe
bell
gave
its
single
note
irene
opened
the
box
in
feverish
dread
an
exclamation
of
despair
broke
from
her
lips
as
some
words
on
the
paper
stood
out
in
the
intensity
of
their
significance
even
before
she
took
the
letter
from
the
box
this
was
what
farnham
replied
hope
nothing
is
the
matter
mr
salt
left
here
quite
half
an
hour
ago
in
his
motor
for
guildford
he
will
stay
there
the
night
or
proceed
to
hanwood
according
to
the
time
he
is
occupied
please
let
me
know
if
there
is
any
trouble
half
an
hour
there
was
not
the
remotest
chance
of
intercepting
him
already
under
ordinary
circumstances
he
would
be
in
the
outskirts
of
guildford
it
only
remained
to
verify
the
worst
she
wrote
a
brief
message
asking
mr
salt
if
he
would
kindly
communicate
with
her
immediately
on
his
arrival
and
despatched
it
to
the
agency
at
guildford
if
there
was
no
reply
to
that
request
during
the
next
she
would
accept
the
arrest
as
an
established
fact
and
there
being
nothing
apparently
to
do
for
the
next
miss
lisle
very
much
to
the
surprise
of
out
of
her
hundred
friends
could
they
have
seen
her
went
down
on
her
knees
in
the
midst
of
a
roomful
of
the
latest
achievements
of
science
and
began
to
pray
that
a
miracle
might
happen
i
suppose
that
i
may
smoke
said
salt
he
was
sitting
handcuffed
in
his
own
charged
with
murder
and
formally
cautioned
that
anything
he
should
say
might
be
used
as
evidence
against
him
it
was
scarcely
a
necessary
warning
in
his
case
with
the
exception
of
an
equally
formal
protest
against
the
arrest
he
had
not
opened
his
lips
until
now
he
and
moeletter
had
sat
silently
facing
one
another
in
the
roomy
car
salt
with
his
face
to
the
driver
and
leaning
back
in
his
easy
seat
with
outward
unconcern
the
detective
braced
to
a
more
alert
attitude
and
with
his
knees
almost
touching
those
of
his
prisoner
for
a
mile
or
more
for
perhaps
seven
or
eight
minutes
by
time
for
the
new
driver
was
cautious
with
the
yet
unknown
car
they
had
proceeded
thus
yet
salt
was
very
far
from
being
unconcerned
as
he
leaned
back
negligently
among
the
cushions
he
was
thinking
keenly
and
with
the
settled
tranquil
gaze
that
betrayed
nothing
watching
alertly
the
miles
of
dreary
that
stretched
along
the
hog
back
before
them
he
had
long
foreseen
the
possibility
of
arrest
and
he
had
taken
certain
precautions
but
to
safeguard
himself
effectually
he
would
have
had
to
abandon
the
more
important
part
of
his
work
and
the
risk
he
ran
was
the
smaller
evil
of
the
two
but
he
had
not
anticipated
this
charge
some
legal
jugglery
with
conspiracy
had
been
in
his
mind
i
suppose
that
i
may
smoke
half
a
mile
ahead
a
solitary
wayfarer
was
approaching
salt
might
have
noted
him
but
there
was
nothing
remarkable
in
his
appearance
except
that
pedestrians
or
vehicles
either
for
that
matter
were
rare
along
the
hog
back
on
that
bitter
winter
afternoon
why
certainly
sir
in
your
own
car
surely
replied
the
inspector
agreeably
he
was
there
to
do
his
duty
and
he
had
done
it
even
down
to
the
detail
of
satisfying
himself
by
search
that
his
prisoner
carried
no
weapon
beyond
that
there
was
no
reason
to
be
churlish
especially
as
every
one
had
to
admit
that
there
was
no
telling
what
might
have
happened
in
a
week
or
a
month
time
can
i
help
you
in
any
way
thank
you
i
will
manage
replied
salt
and
in
spite
of
his
manacles
he
succeeded
without
much
difficulty
in
taking
out
his
and
a
he
lit
a
cigarette
blew
out
the
match
and
then
looked
hesitatingly
round
the
rather
elegant
car
at
the
rich
velvety
carpet
on
the
floor
at
the
vesta
in
his
hand
then
with
easy
unconcern
he
lowered
the
window
by
his
side
and
leaned
forward
towards
it
it
was
a
perfectly
natural
action
but
inspector
moeletter
owed
at
least
one
step
in
his
promotion
to
a
habit
of
always
being
on
his
guard
against
actions
of
that
kind
his
left
foot
quickly
and
imperceptibly
slid
across
the
carpet
so
that
if
salt
made
any
attempt
to
leave
the
car
he
must
inevitably
come
to
grief
across
that
rigid
barrier
with
a
ready
eye
moeletter
noted
afresh
the
handle
of
the
door
the
size
of
the
window
frame
and
every
kindred
detail
his
hands
lay
in
unostentatious
readiness
by
his
side
and
he
felt
no
apprehension
but
salt
had
not
the
faintest
intention
of
attempting
any
sensational
act
he
dropped
the
match
leisurely
from
between
his
fingers
cast
a
glance
up
to
the
sky
where
the
lowering
clouds
had
long
been
threatening
snow
and
then
drew
in
his
head
but
in
some
way
either
from
his
position
a
jolt
of
the
car
or
a
touch
against
the
sash
as
he
did
so
his
cap
was
jerked
off
and
despite
a
quick
but
clumsy
attempt
to
catch
it
in
his
fettered
hands
it
was
whirled
away
behind
in
their
eddying
wake
please
stop
he
said
turning
to
moeletter
i
am
afraid
that
i
shall
find
it
too
cold
without
the
detective
was
not
pleased
but
there
was
nothing
in
the
mishap
that
he
could
take
objection
to
further
he
had
no
wish
to
make
his
prisoner
in
any
way
noticeable
during
the
latter
part
of
their
journey
pull
up
murphy
he
called
through
the
tube
by
his
shoulder
and
with
a
grinding
that
set
its
owner
teeth
on
edge
the
car
came
to
a
standstill
in
two
lengths
moeletter
had
intended
that
the
driver
should
recover
the
cap
but
he
was
saved
the
trouble
the
solitary
pedestrian
had
happened
to
be
on
the
spot
at
the
moment
of
the
incident
and
he
was
standing
by
the
open
window
almost
as
soon
as
the
car
stopped
forgetful
of
his
indignity
salt
stretched
out
a
manacled
hand
and
received
his
property
thank
you
he
said
with
a
pleasant
smile
i
am
much
obliged
go
on
said
moeletter
through
the
tube
i
think
that
i
had
better
get
used
to
these
is
the
professional
name
is
it
not
inspector
to
these
before
i
look
out
again
remarked
salt
the
telescribe
bell
announced
another
message
it
found
irene
sitting
at
the
table
in
the
instrument
room
with
ordnance
maps
around
her
and
the
index
book
of
the
league
most
trusted
agents
lying
open
on
the
shelf
she
just
glanced
at
the
clock
as
she
jumped
up
it
was
exactly
the
last
minute
of
the
that
she
had
fixed
as
the
limit
of
uncertainty
the
message
might
even
yet
be
from
salt
but
it
was
not
it
was
this
instead
fear
mr
salt
has
been
arrested
he
is
in
his
handcuffed
proceeding
towards
guildford
in
charge
of
man
who
has
appearance
of
belonging
to
police
force
driver
is
not
mr
salt
man
mr
made
opp
for
me
to
see
but
said
nothing
passed
just
of
puttenham
roads
good
but
snow
beginning
car
trav
only
hour
shall
remain
here
on
chance
being
use
do
hesitate
a
plan
was
already
floating
in
the
space
between
miss
lisle
adventurous
brain
and
the
maps
the
puttenham
message
crystallised
it
there
was
now
something
to
go
on
the
route
she
knew
already
the
times
and
mileages
also
lay
beneath
her
hand
the
scheme
had
a
hundred
faults
and
only
one
thing
to
recommend
it
that
it
might
succeed
for
ten
minutes
she
flung
herself
into
the
details
of
the
maps
jotting
down
a
time
a
distance
here
and
there
a
detail
of
the
road
puttenham
might
remain
at
his
box
till
dawn
but
all
the
work
all
the
chance
was
forward
before
the
car
at
the
end
of
ten
minutes
irene
picked
up
the
accumulation
of
her
labours
and
rang
up
the
telephone
exchange
what
is
it
murphy
demanded
the
inspector
through
the
tube
as
the
car
came
to
a
dead
stop
something
else
in
the
way
i
ca
quite
make
it
out
sir
was
the
reply
we
just
outside
the
long
railway
arch
and
there
seems
to
be
something
on
fire
towards
the
other
end
terrible
lot
of
smoke
coming
through
ca
we
run
up
to
it
this
is
an
unusually
long
bridge
fifty
or
sixty
yards
i
should
say
i
hardly
like
to
take
you
on
into
that
smoke
sir
oh
very
well
jump
down
and
see
what
it
is
only
be
as
sharp
as
you
can
it
was
now
pitch
dark
and
a
driving
biting
storm
of
snow
and
hail
was
blowing
across
their
path
from
the
east
when
the
had
learned
sufficient
of
the
car
to
give
him
confidence
the
storm
had
swept
down
and
their
progress
had
been
scarcely
any
faster
there
had
been
delays
too
by
ripley
a
heavy
farm
waggon
had
broken
down
almost
before
their
eyes
and
it
had
been
ten
minutes
before
a
spare
chain
horse
could
be
obtained
to
drag
it
to
the
roadside
further
on
some
men
felling
a
tree
in
a
coppice
had
clumsily
allowed
it
to
fall
across
the
road
and
another
ten
minutes
elapsed
before
it
was
cut
in
two
and
rolled
aside
fortunately
they
were
not
pressed
for
time
fortunately
also
the
driver
knew
the
way
for
few
people
were
afoot
to
face
that
dreadful
stream
of
snow
and
ice
with
the
lashing
wind
and
the
numbing
cold
two
two
or
three
or
perhaps
four
men
had
chanced
to
be
at
hand
when
the
car
stopped
making
their
way
towards
the
bridge
but
the
wreathing
snow
soon
cut
them
off
occasionally
when
the
wind
and
drift
hung
for
a
moment
a
figure
or
two
showed
dimly
and
gigantic
in
the
murk
of
the
tunnel
nothing
of
the
fire
could
be
seen
but
the
smoke
continued
to
pour
out
and
the
mingled
odour
of
burned
and
unburned
oil
filled
the
car
in
a
few
minutes
the
driver
returned
when
he
had
left
his
seat
moeletter
had
leaned
forward
and
with
a
gruff
word
of
half
apology
had
laid
a
hand
upon
the
rug
across
salt
knees
so
that
he
held
or
at
least
controlled
the
connecting
links
of
the
handcuffs
while
at
the
same
time
his
other
hand
had
dropped
quietly
down
to
his
he
now
lowered
the
window
on
the
further
side
still
keeping
his
left
hand
on
the
rug
oil
cart
ablaze
sir
gasped
the
driver
between
paroxysms
of
coughing
road
simply
running
fire
and
the
fumes
awful
his
face
was
almost
completely
protected
beneath
cap
goggles
and
a
storm
shade
that
fell
from
the
cap
over
the
shoulders
and
buttoned
across
the
mouth
but
no
covering
had
seemed
effectual
against
the
suffocating
reek
of
the
burning
oil
the
fire
had
melted
the
snow
off
his
clothes
and
he
stood
by
the
door
with
a
bar
of
darkness
just
falling
across
his
face
and
the
electric
light
through
the
lowered
window
blazing
upon
his
gleaming
leathers
his
gauntlets
and
puttee
leggings
and
the
cumbrous
numbered
badge
that
the
regulations
then
imposed
it
will
be
some
time
before
the
road
is
passable
asked
moeletter
with
a
frown
oh
hours
perhaps
was
the
sputtering
reply
would
suggest
going
by
molesey
bridge
sir
best
way
now
is
it
much
out
the
turning
is
half
a
mile
back
from
there
it
is
no
further
than
this
way
and
you
know
the
way
perfectly
the
driver
nodded
perfectly
sir
very
well
go
on
we
have
plenty
of
time
yet
but
you
might
get
a
few
more
miles
out
of
her
if
you
think
you
can
the
driver
jumped
up
to
his
seat
the
horn
gave
its
note
of
warning
and
gliding
round
the
car
began
to
head
back
towards
esher
with
the
open
common
on
either
side
and
the
pelting
wind
behind
it
slackened
for
a
moment
at
the
fork
in
the
turned
to
the
right
and
then
began
to
draw
away
northward
with
an
increased
speed
that
showed
the
driver
to
be
capable
of
rising
to
his
instructions
it
is
fortunate
that
the
inspector
is
not
a
motoring
man
thought
salt
to
himself
with
an
inward
smile
this
is
very
much
too
good
but
the
inspector
only
noticed
that
with
the
increased
speed
the
car
seemed
to
run
more
smoothly
and
even
then
he
had
no
means
of
judging
what
the
increase
had
become
the
man
whose
car
it
was
knew
that
a
very
different
explanation
than
mere
speed
lay
behind
the
sudden
change
that
made
the
motion
now
sheer
luxury
he
knew
with
absolute
conviction
what
had
happened
and
he
would
have
known
without
any
further
evidence
that
the
driver
who
now
had
his
hand
upon
the
wheel
was
a
thousand
miles
ahead
of
murphy
in
it
was
not
the
first
suggestion
of
some
friendly
influence
at
work
that
had
stirred
his
mind
the
incident
of
the
stranded
waggon
across
the
road
by
ripley
was
little
in
itself
even
when
they
were
a
second
time
delayed
by
the
fallen
tree
a
few
miles
further
on
nothing
but
an
unreasoning
hope
could
have
called
it
more
than
coincidence
but
with
the
third
episode
a
matured
plan
began
to
loom
through
the
meaningless
delays
oil
was
here
and
where
there
was
oil
in
england
at
that
day
the
hand
of
the
unity
league
might
be
traced
not
far
away
in
his
mind
eye
salt
ran
over
half
a
dozen
miles
of
the
portsmouth
road
as
far
as
he
could
remember
if
it
was
to
block
the
road
there
was
scarcely
a
more
suitable
spot
than
the
long
railway
bridge
to
be
found
between
esher
and
kingston
and
followed
the
thought
if
it
was
intended
to
force
moeletter
to
accept
the
bridge
at
molesey
no
point
in
all
the
south
of
the
fork
would
have
served
the
three
accidents
had
taken
place
each
at
the
exact
point
where
it
would
best
serve
its
purpose
salt
did
not
even
glance
at
the
driver
when
he
returned
from
the
fire
he
leaned
back
in
his
seat
in
simple
enjoyment
and
inspector
moeletter
thought
from
his
appearance
that
he
was
going
to
sleep
there
was
little
to
be
gained
by
looking
out
apart
from
the
policy
of
unconcern
the
huge
white
that
was
waiting
in
the
by
esher
station
had
its
masked
and
in
the
and
the
night
it
could
not
have
been
seen
ten
yards
away
the
driver
of
the
green
car
sounded
his
horn
for
the
road
as
he
swept
by
and
ten
seconds
later
the
white
car
glided
out
from
its
place
of
concealment
like
a
ghostly
mastodon
and
baring
its
dazzling
lamps
began
to
thrash
along
the
road
in
the
other
wake
what
would
be
their
route
when
they
had
crossed
the
bridge
that
was
salt
constant
thought
now
not
because
he
was
troubled
by
the
chances
but
because
it
was
the
next
point
in
the
unknown
plan
that
would
serve
to
guide
him
he
had
not
long
to
wait
under
the
dexterous
pilotage
of
the
unknown
hand
outside
the
flat
straight
road
became
a
tortuous
village
street
the
lights
of
the
molesey
shops
and
inns
splashed
in
splintering
blurs
across
the
streaming
windows
an
iron
bridge
shook
and
rumbled
beneath
their
wheels
and
they
were
in
middlesex
the
horn
brayed
out
a
continuous
warning
note
the
car
swung
off
to
the
left
and
salt
with
his
eyes
closed
knew
exactly
what
had
been
arranged
but
there
was
yet
inspector
moeletter
to
be
reckoned
with
he
was
ignorant
of
the
roads
but
he
had
a
gift
of
location
and
the
abrupt
turn
to
the
left
when
he
had
seen
what
appeared
to
be
a
broad
leading
straight
on
from
molesey
bridge
gave
him
a
thought
he
turned
to
the
are
you
sure
that
this
is
right
murphy
he
asked
sharply
kingston
must
lie
away
on
the
right
we
go
through
hampton
this
way
sir
and
into
the
kingston
road
at
twickenham
came
the
chattering
reply
in
a
voice
it
is
just
as
near
and
we
do
meet
the
wind
it
was
quite
true
although
the
inspector
might
not
know
it
but
the
ready
explanation
seemed
to
satisfy
him
another
circumstance
would
have
set
his
mind
at
rest
at
hampton
the
route
took
them
equally
to
the
right
salt
did
not
know
the
road
intimately
but
he
knew
that
if
his
surmise
was
correct
they
must
very
soon
draw
away
to
the
left
again
what
would
happen
then
for
three
or
four
miles
they
would
run
between
hedges
and
encounter
nothing
more
urban
than
a
scattered
hamlet
twickenham
they
would
never
see
that
night
inspector
moeletter
was
far
from
being
unsophisticated
and
his
suspicion
had
already
once
apparently
been
touched
how
would
the
race
end
the
car
slowed
down
for
a
moment
but
so
smoothly
that
it
was
almost
imperceptible
and
with
a
clanging
bell
an
electric
tram
swung
into
their
vision
and
out
again
salt
was
taking
note
of
every
trifle
in
this
enthralling
game
why
he
asked
himself
had
so
expert
a
driver
slackened
speed
with
plenty
of
room
to
pass
he
saw
a
possible
explanation
they
had
been
meeting
and
overtaking
trams
at
intervals
all
the
way
from
molesey
bridge
in
another
minute
they
would
have
left
the
and
the
tram
route
and
the
driver
wished
to
hide
the
fact
from
moeletter
as
long
as
possible
he
had
therefore
to
meet
this
tram
so
that
the
inspector
might
unconsciously
carry
in
his
mind
the
evidence
of
their
presence
to
the
last
possible
point
they
were
no
longer
on
the
they
had
glided
off
somewhere
without
a
warning
note
or
any
indication
of
speed
or
motion
to
betray
the
turn
they
had
taken
the
houses
were
becoming
sparser
fields
intervened
with
here
and
there
a
colony
of
cottages
soon
even
the
scattered
buildings
ceased
or
appeared
so
rarely
that
they
only
dotted
long
stretches
of
country
lanes
and
at
every
yard
they
trembled
on
the
verge
of
detection
nothing
but
the
glare
of
light
inside
the
vehicle
and
the
storm
and
darkness
beyond
could
have
hid
for
a
moment
from
even
the
least
suspicious
of
men
the
fact
that
they
were
no
longer
travelling
even
the
most
secluded
of
suburban
and
now
as
if
aware
that
the
deception
could
not
be
maintained
much
longer
the
driver
began
to
increase
the
speed
at
every
open
stretch
again
nothing
but
his
inspired
skill
and
the
excellence
of
the
car
could
disguise
the
fact
that
they
flew
along
the
level
road
while
among
the
narrow
winding
lanes
they
rushed
at
a
headlong
pace
shooting
down
declines
and
breasting
little
hills
without
a
pause
the
horn
boomed
its
warning
every
second
and
from
behind
came
the
answering
note
of
the
long
white
motor
it
had
crept
nearer
and
nearer
since
they
left
the
and
its
brilliant
now
lit
up
the
way
as
far
as
the
pilot
car
little
chance
for
moeletter
to
convoy
his
prisoner
out
of
those
deserted
lanes
whatever
happened
now
what
means
what
desperate
means
he
might
have
taken
in
a
gallant
attempt
to
retrieve
the
position
if
he
had
suspected
treachery
just
a
minute
before
he
did
one
may
speculate
but
never
know
as
it
was
the
uneasy
instinct
that
everything
was
not
right
awoke
too
late
for
him
to
make
the
stand
it
was
less
than
ten
minutes
after
meeting
the
last
tram
that
he
peered
out
into
the
night
doubtfully
but
in
those
ten
minutes
the
green
car
had
all
but
won
its
journey
end
murphy
he
cried
imperiously
with
his
mouth
to
the
tube
and
a
startled
eye
on
salt
tell
me
immediately
where
we
are
a
minute
sir
came
the
hasty
answer
as
the
driver
bent
forward
to
verify
some
landmark
this
brake
stop
this
instant
roared
the
inspector
rising
to
his
feet
in
rage
and
with
a
terrible
foreboding
there
was
a
muffled
rattle
as
they
shot
over
a
bridge
a
curious
sense
of
passing
into
a
new
atmosphere
and
then
with
easy
precision
the
car
drew
round
and
stopped
dead
before
the
open
double
doors
of
its
own
house
no
one
spoke
for
a
moment
there
was
another
muffled
roar
outside
the
sound
of
heavy
iron
doors
clashing
together
and
the
great
white
car
reproduced
their
curve
and
drew
up
by
their
side
from
the
driver
seat
of
the
green
car
the
hon
bruce
wycombe
son
and
heir
of
old
viscount
chiltern
and
the
most
skilful
motorist
in
europe
climbed
painfully
down
and
pulling
off
his
opened
the
door
of
the
car
with
a
bow
that
would
have
been
more
graceful
if
he
had
been
less
frozen
welcome
to
hanwood
after
your
long
journey
inspector
moeletter
he
exclaimed
most
affably
chapter
xviii
the
music
and
the
dance
along
the
great
west
road
ten
thousand
monmouth
colliers
were
streaming
towards
london
in
every
stage
of
famine
and
discomfort
what
they
intended
to
do
when
they
reached
the
capital
they
had
no
clearer
idea
than
had
the
fifteen
thousand
midlanders
at
barnet
all
they
knew
was
that
they
were
starving
at
home
and
they
could
be
no
worse
off
in
london
also
in
london
there
was
to
be
found
the
government
the
government
that
had
betrayed
them
the
conception
of
the
march
had
been
wild
the
execution
was
lamentable
the
leaders
might
have
taken
napoleon
descent
on
moscow
as
their
model
ten
exhausted
their
commissariat
they
were
to
live
on
the
land
they
passed
through
but
the
land
was
agricultural
and
poor
the
populace
regarded
the
monmouth
colliers
as
foreigners
and
the
response
was
scanty
only
one
circumstance
saved
the
march
from
becoming
a
tragedy
of
hundreds
instead
of
merely
as
it
was
a
tragedy
of
scores
the
men
were
being
fed
from
london
by
whom
and
why
not
even
their
leaders
knew
but
each
night
a
railway
truck
full
of
provisions
was
awaiting
their
arrival
at
a
station
on
their
route
and
each
day
the
men
was
informed
where
the
next
supply
would
be
it
influenced
them
to
continue
their
journey
pacifically
when
they
must
otherwise
sooner
or
later
have
abandoned
all
restraint
and
marched
through
anarchy
it
enabled
them
to
reach
london
it
added
another
element
to
the
government
distraction
in
their
day
of
reckoning
it
was
a
detail
but
at
windsor
there
were
no
provisions
waiting
no
one
knew
why
the
station
authorities
had
nothing
to
suggest
after
a
week
regular
supply
the
leaders
had
come
to
expect
their
daily
had
come
to
rely
implicitly
upon
it
and
had
made
no
other
arrangements
they
conferred
together
anxiously
it
was
all
there
was
for
them
to
do
windsor
was
not
sympathetic
towards
them
they
had
not
expected
it
to
be
but
they
had
expected
to
be
independent
of
windsor
friendship
two
thousand
special
constables
escorted
them
in
and
shepherded
them
assiduously
otherwise
there
might
have
been

the
extent
of
windsor
military
resources
then
as
it
was
the
miners
reached
the
royal
borough
hungry
and
left
it
famished
a
rumour
spread
along
the
ranks
as
they
set
out
that
an
unfortunate
mistake
had
been
made
but
that
supplies
would
be
awaiting
them
in
hyde
park
if
that
was
a
detail
as
it
might
well
have
been
it
was
not
wholly
successful
the
men
were
hungry
and
dispirited
but
london
was
not
their
immediate
goal
for
weeks
they
had
been
telling
the
vacillating
cabinet
what
ought
to
be
done
with
the
oil
at
hanwood
and
as
they
set
out
they
had
boasted
to
their
brothers
across
the
rhymney
that
before
they
returned
they
would
show
them
how
to
fire
a
beacon
that
would
singe
the
hair
of
five
million
leaguers
midway
between
windsor
and
london
they
proceeded
to
turn
off
from
the
highway
under
the
direction
of
their
leaders
and
debouching
from
the
narrow
lanes
on
to
the
fields
beyond
they
began
to
advance
across
the
country
in
a
straggling
wave
on
the
previous
day
both
the
home
office
and
the
war
office
had
received
applications
for
protection
from
the
company
at
hanwood
backed
by
evidence
which
left
no
possible
doubt
that
the
monmouth
unemployed
contemplated
an
organised
attack
on
the
oil
store
the
two
departments
replied
distantly
that
in
view
of
the
existing
conditions
within
the
metropolis
and
the
forces
at
their
disposal
it
was
impossible
to
despatch
either
troops
or
constabulary
to
protect
private
property
in
isolated
districts
hanwood
acknowledged
these
replies
and
gave
notice
with
equal
punctilio
that
they
would
take
the
best
means
within
their
power
for
safeguarding
their
interests
and
at
the
same
time
formally
notified
the
government
that
they
held
them
responsible
through
their
failure
to
carry
out
the
obligations
of
their
office
for
all
the
developments
that
the
situation
might
lead
to
an
exchange
of
civilities
which
in
private
life
is
sometimes
attained
much
more
simply
by
two
disputants
consigning
each
other
to
the
society
of
the
prince
of
darkness
in
four
words
whatever
there
might
be
behind
the
intimation
there
was
little
to
indicate
it
at
dusk
that
afternoon
the
stranger
or
the
native
passing
along
miss
lisle
secluded
lane
would
have
noticed
only
two
circumstances
to
suggest
anything
unusual
in
the
air
a
few
hundred
feet
above
the
trees
within
the
wall
a
was
straining
at
its
rope
in
the
rising
gale
from
the
basket
car
a
man
watched
every
movement
of
the
countryside
through
his
and
conversed
from
time
to
time
through
a
telephone
with
the
kite
section
down
below
a
second
wire
ran
from
the
field
telephone
to
a
room
of
the
offices
where
salt
was
engaged
with
half
a
dozen
of
the
chiefs
of
the
council
of
the
league
sir
john
hampden
was
not
present
he
was
remaining
in
london
to
afford
the
government
every
facility
for
negotiating
a
settlement
whenever
they
might
desire
it
in
the
lane
a
group
of
men
with
tickets
in
their
hats
were
loitering
about
the
bridge
they
comprised
a
peaceful
picket
within
the
meaning
of
the
act
they
had
been
there
since
daybreak
and
so
far
no
one
had
shown
any
wish
to
dispute
their
position
the
and
the
picket
in
the
lane
were
the
eyes
of
the
opposing
belligerents
the
league
had
nothing
to
gain
by
submitting
the
issue
to
the
arbitrament
of
lead
and
fire
no
one
had
anything
to
gain
by
it
but
after
a
bout
at
fisticuffs
a
defeated
child
will
sometimes
pick
up
a
dangerous
stone
and
fling
it
the
league
had
accepted
the
challenge
of
those
who
marched
beneath
the
red
banner
for
war
on
constitutional
lines
some
of
those
who
marched
beneath
the
red
banner
were
now
disposed
to
try
the
effect
of
beating
their
ploughshares
into
swords
and
however
much
the
league
might
have
preferred
them
to
keep
to
their
bargain
the
most
effective
retort
was
to
turn
their
own
pacific
sickles
into
bayonets
in
the
staff
room
salt
was
addressing
his
associates
half
military
half
political
who
now
represented
the
innermost
council
of
the
league
some
of
them
had
been
members
of
former
ministries
others
soldiers
who
had
worn
the
insignia
of
generals
but
they
rendered
to
this
unknown
man
among
them
an
unquestioning
allegiance
because
of
what
he
had
already
done
because
he
inspired
them
with
absolute
reliance
in
what
he
would
yet
succeed
in
doing
and
not
least
because
he
had
the
air
that
fitted
the
position
more
than
two
years
ago
he
was
saying
the
first
draft
of
the
formation
and
operations
of
the
league
contained
a
section
much
to
the
following
effect
is
an
essential
feature
of
the
plan
that
the
league
should
work
on
constitutional
lines
from
beginning
to
end
and
in
contemplation
of
bringing
about
the
desired
reforms
without
firing
a
solitary
shot
or
violating
a
single
law
it
is
inevitable
that
when
the
position
becomes
acute
civil
disorders
will
arise
out
of
the
involved
situation
and
demonstrations
of
the
affected
people
will
threaten
the
government
of
the
day
on
the
one
hand
and
the
proposed
league
on
the
other
these
circumstances
it
will
be
prudent
to
contemplate
as
a
last
phase
of
the
struggle
an
organised
military
attack
on
the
property
of
the
league
masked
under
the
form
of
a
popular
riot
but
instigated
or
connived
at
by
responsible
authorities
i
propose
therefore
to
establish
the
league
stores
in
a
position
naturally
suited
for
defence
and
to
adopt
such
further
precautions
as
will
render
them
secure
against
ordinary
attack
we
have
now
reached
that
closing
phase
of
the
struggle
continued
salt
on
the
evidence
of
this
report
from
sir
john
hampden
we
may
assume
that
within
hours
our
aggressive
work
will
be
over
will
our
opponents
in
the
language
of
the
street
quietly
it
has
fallen
to
my
lot
to
read
the
riot
act
on
three
occasions
said
one
of
the
company
and
i
have
seen
disturbances
in
ireland
but
i
have
never
before
known
an
unorganised
mob
to
surround
a
position
completely
and
then
to
sit
down
to
wait
for
night
lieutenant
vivash
wishes
to
speak
to
mr
salt
personally
said
a
subordinate
appearing
at
the
door
salt
stepped
into
the
and
spoke
through
the
telephone
yes
vivash
he
said
to
the
man

the

a
quarter
of
a
mile
away
what

it
two
general

wagons
with

a

with
them

about
two
hundred
men
carrying
rifles
they
are
not
in
uniform
but
they
salt
turned
to
another
instrument
and
jerked
the
switch
rapidly
from
plate
to
plate
as
he
distributed
his
orders

he
turned
again
to
the
kite
telephone
to
ask
vivash
a
detail
there
was
no
response
get
on
with
lieutenant
vivash
as
soon
as
you
can
and
let
me
know
at
once
he
said
to
the
one
who
was
in
charge
as
he
returned
to
the
staff
room
in
less
than
a
minute
the
operator
was
at
the
door
again
i
am
afraid
there
is
something
the
matter
sir
he
explained
i
can
get
no
reply
either
from
lieutenant
vivash
or
from
the

up
the

room
let
some
one
go
at
once
to
mr

and
return
here
with
report
yes
sir
he
turned
to
go
here
mr
moore
he
exclaimed
standing
aside
from
the
door
they
all
read
some
disaster
in
his
face
as
he
entered
i
am
deeply
sorry
to
say
that
lieutenant
vivash
has
been
shot
is
he
seriously
hurt
asked
some
one
he
is
dead
he
was
shot
through
the
head
by
a
marksman
in
welland
wood
salt
broke
the
shocked
silence
we
have
lost
a
brave
comrade
he
said
simply
come
general
trench
let
us
visit
the
walls
it
was
dark
when
they
returned
salt
passed
through
the
room
calling
to
his
side
the
man
with
whom
he
had
been
most
closely
associated
at
hanwood
and
traversing
some
passages
led
the
way
up
a
winding
staircase
into
the
lantern
of
the
tower
here
under
the
direction
of
an
of
royal
engineers
two
powerful
searchlights
were
playing
on
every
inch
of
doubtful
ground
that
lay
within
their
radius
beyond
the
entanglement
that
marked
the
outer
line
of
the
defences
nothing
had
been
seen
not
a
solitary
invader
had
yet
shown
himself
within
the
zone
of
light
the
officer
in
charge
was
explaining
a
technical
detail
of
the
land
when
without
the
faintest
warning
a
fulgent
blaze
of
light
suddenly
ran
along
the
edge
of
a
coppice
half
a
mile
away
and
a
noise
like
the
crackling
of
a
hundred
fires
drifted
on
the
wind
with
the
echo
a
thick
hedge
to
the
east
and
a
wood
lying
on
the
west
joined
in
the
vicious
challenge
a
few
bullets
splashed
harmlessly
against
the
steel
shield
that
ingeniously
protected
the
lantern
the
searchlights
oscillated
uncertainly
from
sky
to
earth
under
the
shock
of
the
surprise
and
then
settled
down
to
stream
unwinkingly
into
the
eyes
of
the
enemy
while
in
the
double
darkness
the
defenders
hugged
the
earth
behind
the
wire
and
began
to
reply
with
cool
deliberation
to
the
opening
volleys
there
was
a
knock
upon
the
door
of
the
little
lantern
room
and
a
telescribe
message
was
placed
before
salt
it
bore
a
sign
showing
that
it
had
come
over
the
private
system
which
the
league
maintained
between
hanwood
and
the
head
office
he
read
it
through
twice
and
for
almost
the
first
time
since
he
had
left
his
youth
behind
he
stood
in
absolute
indecision
it
is
necessary
for
me
to
go
at
once
to
london
he
said
turning
to
his
companion
when
he
had
made
an
irrevocable
choice
you
will
take
command
in
my
absence
evelyn
under
the
guidance
of
the
council
may
i
venture
to
remind
you
sir
that
we
are
completely
surrounded
said
through
his
blank
surprise
i
have
not
overlooked
it
you
will
there
was
a
sullen
roar
away
in
the
north
a
mile
behind
the
coppice
that
had
first
spoken
something
whistled
overhead
not
unmelodiously
and
away
to
the
south
a
shell
burst
harmlessly
among
the
ridges
of
a
ploughed
field
the
nearer
searchlight
elevated
its
angle
a
fraction
and
centred
upon
a
cloud
of
smoke
that
hung
for
a
moment
until
the
gale
whirled
it
to
disintegration
the
army
like
the
navy
had
reverted
to
black
powder
it
was
economy
and
as
it
was
not
intended
ever
to
go
to
war
again
it
scarcely
mattered
marsham
will
engage
that
gun
from
both
platforms
d
and
make
every
effort
to
silence
it
with
the
least
delay
it
is
the
only
real
menace
there
is
hold
the
entanglement
but
not
at
too
heavy
a
cost
if
it
should
be
carried
come
to
my
room
you
have
considered
the
possible
effect
of
your
withdrawal
at
this
moment
salt
said
in
a
low
voice
as
they
hastened
together
along
the
passages
i
can
leave
the
outcome
in
your
hands
with
absolute
reliance
replied
salt
if
hanwood
is
successfully
held
until
it
will
devolve
upon
sir
john
hampden
to
dictate
terms
to
the
government
the
end
is
safely
in
sight
independent
of
my
personality
my
reputation
he
dismissed
that
phase
with
a
shrug
he
threw
open
the
door
of
his
private
office
a
shallow
mahogany
case
about
a
foot
square
locked
and
sealed
was
sunk
into
the
opposite
wall
salt
knocked
off
the
wax
and
opened
the
case
with
a
key
which
he
took
off
the
ring
and
gave
to
as
he
spoke
inside
the
case
were
a
dozen
rows
of
little
ivory
studs
each
engraved
with
a
red
number
fastened
to
the
inside
of
the
lid
was
a
scale
map
of
the
land
lying
between
the
outer
wall
and
the
wire
fence
every
stud
had
its
corresponding
number
surrounded
by
a
crimson
circle
indicated
on
the
plan
if
the
entanglement
should
be
carried
you
will
take
no
further
risk
continued
salt
captain
ford
will
give
you
the
general
indication
of
the
attack
from
the
lantern
there
are
two
men
detailed
to
each
block
of
mines
who
will
signal
you
the
exact
moment
for
firing
each
mine
those
are
the
numbered
indicators
above
the
box
he
paused
at
the
door
time
was
more
than
life
to
him
but
he
had
an
ordered
thought
for
everything
if
you
hear
no
more
of
me
and
what
might
be
imagined
really
troubles
you
evelyn
you
can
make
use
of
this
he
remarked
and
laid
the
telescript
he
had
received
upon
a
table
it
was
not
the
time
for
words
written
or
spoken
beyond
those
of
the
sheerest
necessity
half
an
hour
passed
before
had
an
opportunity
of
glancing
through
the
letter
that
had
called
salt
from
his
post
when
he
had
finished
it
he
took
it
down
and
read
it
aloud
to
the
headquarter
staff
amidst
the
profoundest
silence
in
passionate
vindication
of
his

the
finis
message
the
storm
had
not
decreased
its
violence
when
three
minutes
later
salt
stood
unperceived
on
the
broad
coping
outside
an
upper
storey
of
the
tower
and
sinking
forward
into
the
teeth
of
the
gale
was
borne
upwards
with
rigid
wings
as
a
kite
ascends
in
accordance
with
his
instructions
the
two
searchlights
had
turned
their
beams
steadily
earthward
for
the
time
and
in
the
absolute
blackness
of
the
upper
air
he
could
pass
over
the
firing
lines
of
friends
and
foes
in
comparative
safety
as
he
rose
higher
and
higher
before
turning
to
scud
before
the
wind
he
saw
as
on
a
plan
the
whole
field
of
operations
just
distinguishable
in
its
masses
of
grey
and
black
with
the
points
of
interest
revealing
themselves
by
an
occasional
flash
immediately
beneath
him
beneath
him
at
first
but
every
second
drawing
away
to
the
as
he
drifted
in
the
gale
he
breasted
lay
hanwood
with
its
three
outer
lines
of
defence
from
above
it
seemed
as
though
a
very
bright
needle
was
every
now
and
then
thrust
out
from
the
walls
into
the
dark
night
and
drawn
back
again
on
each
of
the
platforms
d
and
e
two
guns
appeared
to
be
rocking
slightly
in
the
wind
by
all
the
indication
there
was
of
smoke
or
noise
or
even
flame
the
gunners
might
have
been
standing
idly
behind
their
shields
but
over
the
steep
scarp
of
the
little
hill
a
mile
and
a
half
away
shells
were
being
planted
every
ten
yards
or
so
with
the
methodical
regularity
of
a
farmer
dropping
potatoes
along
a
furrow
salt
might
not
have
quite
expected
that
there
would
be
the
necessity
to
fire
those
guns
when
a
year
before
he
had
obtained
for
hanwood
its
complement
of
the
finest
artillery
that
the
world
produced
but
when
the
necessity
did
arise
there
was
no
need
for
the
league
gunners
to
use
black
powder
when
he
had
reached
the
height
he
required
simply
leaning
against
the
wind
salt
moved
a
pinion
slightly
and
bore
heavily
towards
the
right
it
was
the
supreme
moment
for
the
trial
of
skill
as
the
long
flight
that
followed
it
was
the
trial
of
endurance
if
his
nerve
had
failed
if
a
limb
had
lost
its
tension
for
the
fraction
of
a
second
his
brain
reeled
amidst
that
tearing
fury
of
the
element
or
a
single
ring
or
swivel
not
answered
to
its
work
he
would
have
been
crumpled
up
hopelessly
beyond
the
chance
of
recovery
and
flung
headlong
to
the
earth
as
it
was
the
wind
swept
him
round
in
a
great
half
circle
but
it
was
the
wind
his
servant
not
his
master
and
he
turned
its
lusty
violence
to
serve
his
ends
he
caught
a
passing
glimpse
of
the
coppice
whence
the
attack
had
first
been
opened
he
saw
beneath
him
the
line
of
guns
ensconced
behind
the
hill
one
already
overturned
and
centred
in
confusion
and
then
the
sweeping
arc
reached
its
limit
and
he
came
as
it
seemed
to
anchor
in
with
the
earth
slipping
away
beneath
him
as
the
banks
glide
past
a
train
and
a
thousand
weights
and
forces
dragging
at
his
aching
arms
he
had
nothing
to
do
but
to
maintain
a
perfect
balance
among
the
conflicting
cross
winds
that
shot
in
from
above
and
below
and
from
north
and
south
and
to
point
his
course
towards
the
glow
in
the
sky
that
marked
the
capital
a
dozen
words
could
express
it
but
it
required
the
skill
of
the
practised
wingman
the
highest
development
of
every
virile
quality
and
the
spur
of
a
necessity
not
less
than
life
and
death
to
dignify
the
attempt
above
the
foolhardy
whether
beyond
all
that
the
accomplishment
lay
within
the
bounds
of
human
endurance
was
a
further
step
it
would
at
that
time
have
been
impossible
to
pronounce
either
way
with
any
authority
for
not
only
had
the
attempt
never
been
made
but
nothing
approaching
the
attempt
had
been
made
a
breeze
that
ran
five
miles
an
hour
was
considered
enough
for
any
purpose
to
take
to
the
air
when
the
anemometer
indicated
fifteen
miles
an
hour
was
not
allowed
at
the
practice
grounds
and
the
record
in
this
direction
lay
with
an
expert
who
had
accomplished
a
straight
flight
in
a
wind
that
travelled
a
little
less
than
thirty
miles
an
hour
the
storm
on
the
night
of
the
of
january
tore
across
the
face
of
the
land
with
a
general
velocity
of
fifty
or
sixty
miles
an
hour
rising
at
times
even
higher
under
the
racking
agony
of
every
straining
tendon
and
the
heady
pressure
of
the
wind
a
sense
of
mundane
unreality
began
to
settle
upon
the
flier
he
saw
the
earth
and
its
landmarks
being
drawn
smoothly
and
swiftly
from
beneath
him
with
the
detachment
of
a
dream
he
saw
for
he
remembered
afterwards
the
thames
lying
before
him
like
a
whip
flicked
carelessly
across
the
plain
a
town
loomed
up
black
and
inchoate
on
his
right
developed
into
streets
and
terraces
and
slid
away
into
the
past
it
was
richmond
the
river
never
far
away
now
slipped
beneath
him
at
right
angles
reappeared
to
hold
a
parallel
course
upon
his
left
and
flung
a
coil
two
miles
ahead
a
colony
of
strange
shining
roofs
and
domes
next
challenged
recognition
they
were
the
conservatories
at
kew
looking
little
more
than
garden
frames
and
they
were
scarcely
lost
to
view
before
he
was
over
the
winding
line
of
brentford
quaint
old
high
street
now
as
it
appeared
packed
with
a
dense
moving
crowd
the
irresistible
pounding
of
the
gale
was
edging
the
glow
of
london
further
and
further
to
his
right
instinctively
he
threw
more
weight
into
the
lighter
scale
and
slowly
and
certainly
the
point
of
his
destination
swung
round
before
his
face
again
thenceforward
it
was
all
town
gunnersbury
became
chiswick
chiswick
merged
into
hammersmith
kensington
succeeded
in
ceaseless
waves
of
houses
that
ran
north
and
south
and
long
vistas
of
roofs
that
stretched
east
and
west
it
was
a
kaleidoscope
of
contrasts
scenes
of
saturnalian
gaiety
where
beings
danced
in
mad
abandonment
round
fires
that
blocked
the
road
or
seemed
to
gyrate
by
companies
in
meaningless
confusion
bounded
districts
plunged
into
an
unnatural
gloom
and
solitude
where
for
street
after
street
neither
the
footstep
of
a
wayfarer
nor
the
light
of
a
public
lamp
broke
the
uncanny
spell
immediately
beyond
by
the
glare
of
the
flambeaux
which
they
carried
an
orderly
concourse
might
be
marching
eastward
and
fringing
on
their
route
a
garish
gutter
mart
where
busy
costermongers
drove
their
roaring
trade
and
frugal
housewives
did
their
marketing
with
less
outward
concern
than
if
the
crisis
in
the
state
had
been
a
crisis
in
the
price
of
butter
the
multitudinous
sounds
beat
on
his
ears
through
the
plunging
gale
like
a
babel
of
revelry
heard
between
the
intermittent
swinging
of
an
unlatched
door
the
sights
in
their
grotesque
perspective
began
to
melt
together
lazily
the
upper
air
grew
very
cold
the
weights
hung
heavier
every
mile
the
contending
forces
pulled
more
resistlessly
strange
fancies
began
to
assail
him
as
the
brain
shrank
beneath
the
strain
doubts
and
despairs
to
gather
round
like
dark
birds
of
the
night
with
hopeless
foreboding
in
the
dull
measure
of
their
funereal
wings
in
that
moment
mind
and
body
almost
failed
to
contend
against
the
crushing
odds
nothing
but
his
unconquerable
heart
flogged
on
his
dying
limbs
it
was
scarcely
more
than
half
an
hour
after
she
had
written
her
despairing
message
that
from
her
post
at
the
head
of
the
broad
stone
staircase
irene
lisle
heard
a
noise
in
the
garret
storey
above
that
sent
her
flying
back
to
her
stronghold
it
was
the
last
point
from
which
she
had
expected
an
attack
through
the
keyhole
of
the
door
behind
which
she
had
taken
refuge
she
saw
a
strangely
outlined
figure
groping
his
way
cumbrously
down
the
stairs
and
then
without
a
word
or
cry
but
with
a
face
whiter
than
the
paper
that
had
summoned
him
she
threw
open
the
door
to
admit
salt
he
walked
heavily
along
the
corridor
and
turned
into
his
own
room
while
she
relocked
the
door
and
followed
him
there
was
mute
enquiry
in
her
eyes
but
she
did
not
speak
a
powerful
stood
upon
the
throwing
its
beams
across
the
room
he
stood
over
it
while
the
beaded
ice
melted
from
his
hair
and
fell
hissing
on
the
iron
he
opened
his
mouth
and
the
sound
of
his
voice
was
like
the
thin
piping
of
a
reed
she
caught
a
word
and
began
to
unbuckle
the
frozen
straps
of
his
gear
when
he
was
free
he
tried
to
raise
his
hand
to
a
pocket
of
his
coat
but
the
effort
was
beyond
the
power
of
the
cramped
limb
irene
interpreted
the
action
and
finding
there
a
flask
filled
the
cup
and
held
it
to
his
lips
she
got
a
blue
smile
of
thanks
over
the
edge
of
the
cup
ah
he
said
beginning
to
find
his
voice
again
and
stamping
about
the
room

owe

you
and
i
miss
lisle
now
you
must
write
a
telescript
for
me
please
for
i
can
not
if
you
will
remain
here
where
it
is
warmer
i
will
bring
the
materials
she
suggested
he
thanked
her
and
allowed
her
to
go
watching
her
with
thoughtful
eyes
that
were
coming
back
to
life
she
paused
a
moment
at
the
top
of
the
stairs
to
listen
down
the
shaft
and
then
sped
quickly
through
the
smoke
to
the
instrument
room
on
the
floor
beneath
salt
glanced
round
the
office
on
and
about
his
desk
all
the
books
and
papers
that
might
be
turned
to
a
hostile
purpose
had
been
stacked
in
readiness
and
by
them
stood
the
can
of
oil
that
was
to
ensure
their
complete
destruction
he
stepped
up
to
the
window
and
looked
out
cautiously
every
pane
of
glass
was
broken
every
pane
of
glass
in
trafalgar
chambers
was
broken
for
that
matter
but
it
was
not
easy
for
an
unprepared
mob
to
force
an
entrance
when
the
unity
league
had
taken
over
the
whole
block
of
building
in
its
expansion
many
alterations
had
been
carried
out
and
among
these
had
been
to
fix
railings
that
sprang
from
the
street
and
formed
an
arch
not
only
over
the
basement
but
over
the
ground
floor
windows
also
if
the
shutters
on
the
windows
had
been
closed
in
time
the
assailants
would
have
been
baffled
at
another
point
but
the
shutters
had
been
overlooked
and
the
mob
after
lighting
great
fires
in
the
street
was
now
flinging
the
blazing
billets
through
the
lower
windows
in
a
very
brief
minute
irene
was
back
again
with
the
telescribe
accessories
she
seated
herself
at
a
table
dipped
her
pen
into
the
ink
and
looked
up
without
a
word
trafalgar

each

assuming

he
stood
considering
whether
there
was
anything
more
to
add
usefully
the
sound
of
irene
agate
pen
tapping
persistently
against
the
table
caught
his
ear
you
are
not
very
much
afraid
he
asked
with
kindly
reassurance
in
his
voice
as
he
looked
at
her
hand
no
not
now
she
replied
but
as
she
wrote
she
had
to
still
the
violent
trembling
of
her
right
hand
with
the
left
all
going
well
here
send
messenger
hampden
with
report
immediately
after
engagement
he
concluded
i
will
try
to
sign
it
myself
he
succeeded
in
sprawling
a
recognisable
george
salt
across
the
paper
and
after
it
wrote
finis
which
happened
to
be
the
for
the
day
your
message
came
through
this
may
possibly
do
the
same
he
remarked
he
turned
off
the
radiator
as
orderly
as
though
he
had
reached
the
close
of
a
working
day
and
they
went
out
together
locking
the
doors
behind
them
they
were
attacking
hanwood
when
you
left
she
asked
with
the
tensest
interest
they
had
sent
off
the
telescript
and
it
seemed
to
irene
that
they
had
reached
the
end
of
things
yes
he
replied
but
all
the
same
he
added
as
a
fresh
outburst
of
cries
rose
from
the
street
and
the
light
through
the
shattered
window
attracted
a
renewed
fusillade
of
missiles
i
think
that
we
have
kept
our
promise
to
let
you
be
in
the
thick
of
it
she
shook
her
head
with
the
very
faintest
smile
that
seems
a
very
long
time
ago
but
you
how
could
come
when
i
sent
i
never
thought
i
never
dreamed
it
was
possible
to
leave
he
said
my
work
is
done
yes
in
reply
to
her
startled
glance
it
has
all
happened
you
mean
she
asked
eagerly
he
took
a
paper
from
his
it
was
as
she
saw
immediately
a
telescript
from
sir
john
hampden
it
had
reached
him
at
hanwood
an
hour
before
he
left
i
have
this
afternoon
received
a
deputation
of
ministerialists
who
have
the
adherence
of
a
majority
in
the
house
without
taking
the
opposition
into
account
she
read
the
parliamentary
representation
committees
throughout
the
country
are
frantically
insisting
upon
members
accepting
if
we
will
give
an
undertaking
that
the
normal
balance
of
trade
and
labour
shall
be
restored
at
once
the
cabinet
is
going
to
pieces
every
hour
and
the
situation
can
no
longer
either
be
faced
or
ignored
by
the
government
there
will
be
a
great
scene
in
the
house
the
deputation
will
see
me
again
morning
with
a
formal
decision
i
have
confidential
assurances
that
a
complete
acceptance
is
a
foregone
conclusion
the
arrival
of
the
midland
colliers
if
not
of
those
from
monmouth
will
precipitate
matters
tears
she
could
not
hold
back
stood
in
her
eyes
as
she
returned
to
him
the
paper
then
it
has
not
been
in
vain
she
said
softly
no
he
replied
nothing
has
been
in
vain
they
stood
silently
for
a
minute
looking
back
over
life
so
might
two
shipwrecked
passengers
have
stood
on
a
frail
raft
waiting
for
the
end
resigned
but
not
unhopeful
of
a
larger
destiny
beyond
while
the
elements
boiled
and
roared
around
them
it
was
very
weak
of
me
to
send
that
message
said
irene
presently
the
message
that
brought
you
i
suppose
she
added
that
it
the
message
that
brought
you
yes
thank
god
he
replied
and
if
it
had
been
impossible
for
you
to
come
if
it
had
been
an
utterly
critical
moment
in
every
way
what
would
you
have
done
he
laughed
a
little
quietly
as
he
looked
at
her
the
question
did
not
arise
fortunately
he
replied
no
she
admitted
only
i
felt
a
little
curious
to
know
now
that
everything
is
over
it
is
it
there
is
nothing
to
be
done
oh
yes
he
replied
with
indomitable
cheerfulness
there
is
always
something
to
be
done
a
chance
she
whispered
incredulously
a
chance
of
escape
you
mean
it
is
possible
he
said
at
least
i
will
go
and
hear
what
they
have
to
say
no
no
she
cried
out
as
a
dreadful
scene
rose
to
her
imagination
you
can
not
understand
do
you
hear
that
they
would
kill
you
i
do
not
suppose
that
i
shall
find
myself
popular
he
said
with
a
smile
but
i
will
take
care
you
i
think
you
must
stay
here
can
not
i
come
with
you
she
pleaded
see
i
am
armed
he
took
the
tiny
weapon
that
she
drew
from
her
dress
and
looked
at
it
with
gentle
amusement
it
was
a
pretty
thing
of
ivory
and
nickeled
steel
an
elaborate
toy
he
pressed
the
action
and
shook
out
the
tiny
loaded
caps
they
were
little
more
than
that
upon
his
palm
i
would
rather
that
you
did
not
use
this
upon
a
mob
he
said
reloading
it
it
would
only
exasperate
without
disabling
as
for
stopping
a
rush
why
i
doubt
if
one
of
these
would
stop
a
determined
rabbit
you
have
better
weapons
than
this
i
suppose
you
are
right
only
it
gave
me
a
little
confidence
then
you
shall
keep
it
for
a
memento
if
you
will
no
it
might
hold
off
a
single
assailant
i
suppose
i
should
value
this
much
more
if
i
might
have
it
he
touched
a
silk
tie
that
she
had
about
her
neck
as
he
spoke
it
was
one
that
she
had
often
worn
she
held
up
her
head
for
him
to
disengage
it
some
day
he
said
lingering
a
little
over
the
simple
operation
you
will
understand
many
things
irene
i
think
that
i
understand
everything
now
she
replied
with
a
brave
glance
everything
that
is
worth
understanding
he
placed
the
folded
tie
in
an
inner
pocket
and
went
down
the
stone
steps
without
another
word
the
well
was
thick
with
smoke
but
the
fire
had
not
yet
spread
beyond
the
lower
rooms
down
he
encountered
a
barricade
of
light
office
furniture
which
the
girl
had
flung
across
the
stairs
and
drenched
with
oil
it
was
no
obstacle
in
itself
but
at
the
touch
of
a
match
it
would
have
sprung
into
a
conflagration
that
would
have
held
the
wildest
mob
at
bay
for
a
few
precious
moments
he
picked
his
way
through
it
descended
the
remaining
stairs
and
unlocked
the
outer
door
beyond
this
was
an
iron
curtain
that
had
been
lowered
a
little
door
in
it
opened
directly
on
to
the
steps
that
led
down
to
seaton
street
salt
looked
through
a
crevice
of
the
iron
curtain
and
listened
long
enough
to
learn
that
there
was
no
one
on
the
upper
steps
for
the
upper
steps
indeed
commanded
no
view
of
the
windows
and
the
windows
were
the
centres
of
all
interest
satisfied
on
this
point
he
quietly
unlocked
the
door
and
stepped
out
chapter

of
salaveira
to
the
majority
of
those
who
thronged
seaton
street
the
effect
of
sudden
instantaneous
as
it
seemed
and
unexpected
appearance
was
to
endow
it
with
a
dramatic
almost
an
uncanny
value
the
front
rows
especially
those
standing
about
the
steps
fell
back
and
the
further
rows
pressed
forward
and
because
an
undisciplined
mob
stricken
by
acute
surprise
must
express
its
emotion
outwardly
by
silence
if
it
has
hitherto
been
noisy
and
by
exclamation
if
it
has
been
silent
the
shouts
and
turmoil
in
the
street
instantly
dwindled
away
to
nothing
like
a
breath
of
vapour
passing
from
a
window
pane
salt
raised
his
hand
and
he
had
the
tribute
of
unstirring
silence
the
silence
for
the
moment
of
blank
astonishment
my
friends
and
enemies
he
said
in
a
voice
that
had
learned
from
the
same
school
that
demosthenes
had
practised
in
you
have
been
calling
me
for
some
time
in
a
few
minutes
i
must
listen
to
whatever
you
have
to
say
but
first
there
is
another
matter
that
we
must
arrange
i
take
it
for
granted
that
when
you
began
your
spirited
demonstration
here
you
had
no
idea
that
there
was
a
lady
in
the
building
not
being
accustomed
to
the
sterner
side
of
politics
so
formidable
a
display
rather
disconcerted
her
and
not
knowing
the
invariable
chivalry
of
english
working
men
she
hesitated
to
come
out
before
now
as
it
is
dark
and
the
streets
of
london
are
not
what
they
once
were
i
want
half
a
dozen
good
stout
fellows
to
see
the
lady
safely
to
her
home
be
damned
growled
a
voice
among
the
mass
what
do
you
take
us
for
men
retorted
salt
incisively
or
there
would
be
no
use
in
asking
you
yes
men
but
famished
desperate
werewolf
men
cried
a
poor
gaunt
creature
clad
in
grotesque
rags
who
stood
near
men
who
have
seen
women
starve
and
sink
before
our
eyes
men
who
have
watched
children
dying
by
a
slower
crooler
death
than
fire
an
eye
for
an
eye
tyrant
your
league
has
struck
at
women
folk
through
us
then
strike
at
ours
through
us
cried
salt
stilling
with
the
measured
passion
of
his
voice
the
rising
murmurs
of
assent
i
am
here
to
offer
you
a
substitute
do
you
think
that
no
woman
will
mourn
for
me
he
sent
his
voice
ringing
over
their
heads
like
a
prophetic
knell
the
cause
that
must
stoop
to
take
the
life
of
a
defenceless
woman
is
lost
for
ever
as
long
as
he
could
offer
them
surprises
he
could
hold
the
mere
mob
in
check
but
there
was
among
the
crowd
an
element
that
was
not
of
the
crowd
a
chosen
sprinkling
who
were
superior
to
the
swaying
passions
of
the
moment
not
good
enough
said
a
man
who
had
little
that
was
famished
desperate
or
wolfish
in
his
appearance
you
both
there
and
there
you
shall
both
stay
by
god
eh
comrades
he
spoke
decisively
and
made
a
movement
as
though
he
would
head
a
rush
towards
the
steps
salt
dropped
one
hand
upon
the
iron
door
with
a
laugh
that
sounded
more
menacing
than
most
men
threats
not
so
fast
rorke
he
said
contemptuously
you
grasp
too
much
even
in
your
unpleasant
business
you
can
practise
moderation
i
am
here
but
there
is
no
reason
on
earth
why
i
should
stay
scarcely
more
than
half
an
hour
ago
i
was
at
hanwood
where
by
the
way
your
friends
are
being
rather
badly
crumpled
up
and
you
are
all
quite
helpless
to
prevent
me
going
again
they
guessed
the
means
they
saw
the
unanswerable
strength
of
his
position
and
recognised
their
own
impotence
who
are
you
any
way
came
a
dozen
voices
i
am
called
george
salt
possibly
you
have
heard
the
name
before
come
men
he
cried
impatiently
what
have
you
to
think
twice
about
surely
it
is
worth
while
to
let
a
harmless
girl
escape
to
make
certain
of
that
terrible
person
salt
there
was
a
strangled
scream
in
the
vestibule
behind
unable
to
bear
the
suspense
any
longer
irene
had
crept
down
the
stairs
in
time
to
hear
the
last
few
sentences
for
a
minute
she
had
stood
transfixed
at
the
horror
of
the
position
she
realised
then
she
flung
herself
against
salt
arm
and
tried
to
beat
her
way
past
to
face
the
mob
you
shall
not
she
cried
distractedly
i
will
not
be
saved
at
that
price
i
shall
throw
myself
out
of
the
window
into
the
fire
anywhere
yes
i
desperate
but
i
know
what
i
am
saying
come
back
and
let
us
wait
together
die
together
if
it
is
to
be
but
i
do
go
alone
the
crowd
began
to
surge
restlessly
about
in
waves
of
excited
motion
the
interruption
in
effect
had
been
the
worst
thing
that
could
have
happened
there
were
in
the
throng
many
who
beneath
their
seething
passion
could
appreciate
the
nobility
of
salt
many
who
in
the
midst
of
their
sullen
enmity
were
wrung
with
admiration
for
irene
heroic
spirit
but
the
contagion
to
press
forward
dominated
all
salt
had
irretrievably
lost
his
hold
upon
their
reason
and
with
that
hold
he
saw
the
last
straw
of
his
most
forlorn
hope
floating
away
in
another
minute
he
must
either
retreat
into
the
burning
building
where
he
might
at
any
time
find
the
stairs
impassable
with
smoke
or
remain
to
be
overwhelmed
by
a
savage
rush
and
beaten
to
the
ground
men
cried
irene
desperately
listen
before
you
do
something
that
will
for
ever
make
shameful
in
the
history
of
our
country
do
you
know
whom
you
wish
to
kill
he
is
the
greatest
englishman
there
were
angry
cries
from
firebrands
scattered
here
and
there
among
the
crowd
and
a
movement
from
behind
where
the
new
contingents
hurrying
down
the
side
streets
pressed
most
heavily
flung
the
nearest
rows
upon
the
lower
steps
salt
revolver
which
he
had
not
shown
before
drove
them
back
again
and
gave
him
a
moment
grace
quick
he
cried
my
offer
still
holds
good
one
man
shouldered
his
way
through
to
the
front
and
seeing
him
salt
allowed
him
to
come
on
he
walked
up
the
steps
deliberately
with
a
face
sad
rather
than
revengeful
and
they
spoke
together
hurriedly
under
the
shadow
of
the
revolver
if
it
can
be
done
yet
i
be
one
of
the
posse
to
see
to
the
young
lady
said
the
volunteer
i
have
no
mind
to
wait
for
the
other
job
that
coming
take
care
of
her
get
her
back
into
the
hall
replied
salt
gently
very
gently
friend
two
more
volunteers
had
their
feet
upon
the
steps
one
a
butcher
reeking
of
the
stalls
the
other
sleek
and
with
the
appearance
of
a
prosperous
artisan
i
pick
my
men
cried
salt
sharply
and
his
steady
weapon
emphasised
his
choice
one
man
passing
on
through
the
iron
doorway
the
other
turning
sharp
from
the
insistent
barrel
to
push
his
way
back
into
the
crowd
with
a
bitter
imprecation
it
was
too
much
to
hope
that
the
position
could
be
maintained
the
impatient
mob
had
only
been
held
off
momentarily
from
its
purpose
as
a
pack
of
wolves
can
be
stayed
by
the
fleeing
traveller
who
throws
from
his
sleigh
article
after
article
to
entice
their
curiosity
salt
had
nothing
more
to
offer
them
his
life
was
already
a
hostage
to
the
honour
of
those
whom
he
had
allowed
to
pass
others
were
pressing
on
to
him
with
cries
the
terrible
irresistible
forward
surge
of
a
soulless
mob
when
individuality
is
merged
into
the
dull
brutishness
of
a
trampling
herd
was
launched
stobalt
cried
a
lusty
voice
at
his
shoulder
salt
turned
instinctively
a
man
in
sailor
dress
with
the
guns
and
star
of
his
grade
upon
his
sleeve
had
climbed
along
the
arch
of
the
railings
with
a
sailor
resourcefulness
and
had
reached
his
ear
salt
remembered
him
quite
well
but
he
did
not
speak
a
word
ah
sir
i
thought
that
war
no
other
voice
in
the
world
although
the
smoke
befogged
my
eyes
a
bit
keep
back
you
gutter
rats
he
roared
above
every
other
sound
rising
up
in
his
commanding
position
and
balancing
himself
by
a
stanchion
of
the
gate
d
think
you
know
who
you
standing
up
before
you
salt
aye
he
enough
is
stobalt
of
the
old
of
salaveira
three
years
before
the
moment
would
have
found
salt
cold
as
cold
as
ice
and
as
unresponsive
but
he
had
learned
many
things
since
then
and
sacrificed
his
pride
and
reticence
on
many
altars
he
saw
before
him
a
phalanx
of
humanity
startled
into
one
common
expression
of
awe
and
incredulity
he
saw
the
hostile
wave
that
was
to
overwhelm
him
spend
itself
in
a
sharp
recoil
by
a
miracle
the
fierce
lust
of
triumphant
savagery
had
died
out
of
the
starved
pathetic
faces
now
turned
eagerly
to
him
by
a
miracle
the
gathering
roar
for
vengeance
had
sunk
into
an
expectant
hush
broken
by
nothing
but
the
whispered
repetition
of
his
name
on
ten
thousand
lips
he
saw
in
a
flash
a
hundred
details
of
the
magic
of
that
name
he
knew
that
if
ever
in
his
life
he
must
throw
restraint
and
moderation
to
the
winds
and
paint
his
rôle
in
broad
and
lurid
colours
that
moment
had
arrived
and
at
the
call
he
took
his
destiny
between
his
hands
they
saw
him
toss
his
weapon
through
the
railings
into
the
space
beneath
marked
him
come
to
the
edge
of
the
step
and
stand
with
folded
arms
defenceless
there
before
them
and
the
very
whispers
died
away
in
breathless
anticipation
yes
he
cried
with
a
passionate
vehemence
that
held
their
breath
and
stirred
their
hearts
i
am
stobalt
of
salaveira
the
man
who
brought
you
victory
when
you
were
trembling
in
despair
i
saved
england
for
you
then
but
that
was
when
men
loved
their
country
and
did
not
think
it
a
disgraceful
thing
to
draw
a
sword
and
die
for
her
what
is
that
to
you
you
who
have
been
taught
to
forget
what
glory
means
and
what
is
england
to
you
you
whose
leaders
have
sold
her
splendour
for
a
higher
wage
no
no
cried
a
thousand
voices
frantic
to
appease
the
man
for
whose
blood
they
had
been
howling
scarcely
a
minute
before
you
shall
be
our
leader
we
will
follow
you
to
death
stobalt
of
salaveira
stobalt
for
ever
stobalt
of
salaveira
stobalt
and
england
the
frenzied
roar
of
welcome
the
waving
hands
the
hats
flung
high
the
mingled
cries
caught
from
lip
to
lip
went
rolling
up
the
street
kindling
by
a
name
and
an
imperishable
memory
other
streets
and
other
crowds
into
a
tumult
of
mad
enthusiasm
along
pall
mall
through
trafalgar
square
into
the
strand
and
whitehall
north
by
regent
street
and
the
haymarket
to
piccadilly
running
east
and
west
splitting
north
and
south
twisting
and
leaping
from
group
to
group
and
mouth
to
mouth
ran
the
strange
but
stirring
cry
carrying
wonder
and
concern
on
its
wing
but
always
passing
with
a
cheer
seven
years
had
passed
since
the
day
of
salaveira
and
the
memory
of
it
was
still
enough
to
stir
a
crowd
to
madness
for
there
had
been
no
salaveiras
since
to
dim
its
splendour
seven
years
ago
the
name
of
salaveira
had
brought
pallor
to
the
cheek
and
the
thought
of
what
was
happening
there
stole
like
an
icy
cramp
round
the
heart
of
every
englishman
the
nation
had
grown
accustomed
to
accept
defeat
on
land
with
the
comfortable
assurance
that
nothing
could
avert
a
final
victory
its
pride
was
in
its
navy
invincible
the
war
that
came
had
been
of
no
one
seeking
but
it
came
and
the
nation
called
upon
its
navy
to
sweep
the
presumptuous
enemy
from
off
the
seas
then
came
a
pause
a
rumour
doubted
disbelieved
but
growing
stronger
every
hour
the
english
fleets
not
so
well
placed
as
they
might
have
been
owing
to
political
reasons
that
made
mobilisation
inadvisable
while
there
was
still
a
chance
of
peace
being
maintained
were
unable
to
effect
a
junction
immediately
and
were
falling
back
before
the
united
power
of
the
new
alliance
hour
after
hour
day
after
day
night
after
night
crowds
stood
hopefully
doubtfully
incredulously
in
front
of
the
newspaper
office
windows
waiting
for
the
news
that
never
came
the
fleets
had
not
yet
combined
the
truth
first
leaked
then
blazed
they
were
unable
to
combine
desperately
placed
on
the
outer
line
they
were
falling
back
ever
falling
back
into
a
more
appalling
isolation
a
coaling
station
had
been
abandoned
just
where
its
presence
proved
to
have
been
vital
a
few
battleships
had
been
dropped
from
the
programme
and
the
loss
of
their
weight
in
the
chain
just
proved
fatal
men
did
not
linger
much
at
fleet
street
windows
then
they
slunk
to
and
fro
singly
a
hundred
times
a
day
read
behind
the
empty
bulletins
with
poignant
intuition
and
turned
silently
away
in
the
mourning
capital
they
led
nightmare
lives
from
which
they
could
only
awake
to
a
more
definite
despair
and
the
first
word
of
the
hurrying
newsboy
raucous
shout
sent
a
sickening
wave
of
dread
to
every
heart
there
was
everything
to
fear
and
nothing
at
all
to
hope
could
peace
be
made
not
a
glorious
but
a
decent
living
peace
was
was
even
london
safe
kind

threw
back
the
answers
in
the
fewest
crudest
words
england

have
to
sue
for
peace
on
bended
knees
and
bringing
heavy
tribute
in
her
hands

at

miraculously
one
foggy
night
the
loomed
spectrally
through
the
shifting
mist
that
drifted
uncertainly
from
off
the
land
and
rammed
the
first
leviathan
that
crossed
her
path
while
the
two
destroyers
torpedoed
her
next
neighbour

before

and
had
begun
to

from

the
matter

between

their

and

with

and
vital
parts
with
large
shell

a
range
closer
than
that
at
which
any
engagement
had
been
fought
out
since
the
day
when
the
treasury
had
begun
to
implore
the
admiralty
to
impress
upon
her
admirals
what
a
battleship
really
cost
before
they
sent
her
into
action

everything
to

and
nothing
but
herself
to
lose
and
when
morning
broke
over
salaveira
untidy
bay
she
had
gained
everything
and
lost
so
little
that
even
the
new
alliance
took
no
pride
in
mentioning
it
in
the
cross
account
it
was
of
course
as
every
naval
expert
could
have
demonstrated
on
the
board
an
impossible
thing
to
do
steam
searchlights
wireless
telegraphy
guns
and
a
hundred
other
innovations
had
effaced
the
man
and
the
spirit
of
the
elizabethan
age
was
at
a
discount
what
drake
would
have
done
or
hawkins
what
would
have
been
a
sweet
and
pleasing
adventure
to
sir
richard
grenville
or
another
santa
cruz
to
blake
would
have
been
in
their
heirs
unmitigated
suicide
by
the
verdict
of
any
orthodox
court
martial
largely
imbued
with
the
elizabethan
spirit
the
genius
of
ensuring
everything
that
was
possible
and
then
throwing
into
the
scale
a
splendid
belief
in
much
that
seemed
impossible
stobalt
succeeded
in
doing
what
perhaps
no
one
else
would
have
succeeded
in
doing
merely
because
perhaps
no
one
else
would
have
tried
stobalt
of
salaveira
come
down
and
lead
us
the
wild
enthusiasm
the
strange
unusual
cries
went
echoing
to
the
sky
and
reverberating
down
every
street
and
byway
behind
barred
doors
men
listened
to
the
shout
and
wondered
crouching
in
alleys
tramping
the
road
with
no
further
hope
in
life
beggars
and
heard
the
name
and
dimly
associated
it
with
something
pleasant
in
the
past
it
met
the
force
of
special
constables
hastening
from
the
west
it
fell
on
the
ears
of
mr
strummery
driving
by
unfrequented
ways
towards
the
house
stobalt
and
england
stobalt
for
us
stobalt
and
the
navy
it
was
like
another
salaveira
night
with
stobalt
there
among
them
the
man
who
was
too
modest
to
be
fêted
the
man
whose
very
features
were
unknown
at
home
stobalt
of
salaveira
imagine
it
measure
by
the
fading
but
not
yet
quite
forgotten
memory
of
another
time
of
direful
humiliation
and
despair
what
salaveira
must
have
been
they
had
passed
a
week
of
fervent
exaltation
a
week
of
calm
assurance
a
week
of
rather
tremulous
hope
and
for
the
last
quarter
a
long
dumb
misery
that
conveyed
no
other
sense
of
time
in
later
years
than
that
of
formless
night
they
were
waiting
for
the
stroke
of
doom
then
at
midnight
came
the
sudden
tumult
from
afar
sounding
to
those
who
listened
in
painful
silence
strangely
unlike
the
note
of
defeat
the
frantic
mingled
shouts
the
tearing
feet
in
the
road
beneath
the
wild
bells
pealing
out
the
guns
and
rockets
to
add
to
the
delirium
of
the
night
and
the
incredible
burden
of
the
intoxicating
news
great
victory
salaveira
relieved
utter
annihilation
of
the
blockading
fleet
the
philosopher
might
withdraw
to
solitude
and
moralise
the
friend
of
humanity
stand
aside
pained
that
his
countrymen
should
possess
so
much
human
nature
but
to
the
great
primitive
emotional
heart
of
the
community
the
choice
lay
between
going
out
and
shouting
and
staying
in
and
going
mad
never
before
in
history
had
there
been
a
victory
that
so
irresistibly
carried
the
nation
off
its
feet
to
the
populace
it
had
seemed
from
beginning
to
end
to
contain
just
those
qualities
of
daredevilry
and
fortuitous
ease
that
appeal
to
the
imagination
they
were
quite
mistaken
the
conception
had
been
desperate
but
beyond
that
the
details
of
the
relief
of
salaveira
had
been
as
methodical
as
painstaking
and
as
as
those
which
had
marked
the
civil
campaign
now
drawing
to
a
close
that
was
why
a
famished
starving
mob
remembered
salaveira
they
would
have
stoned
a
duke
or
burned
a
bishop
with
very
little
compunction
but
stobalt
ranked
among
their
immortals
they
did
not
even
seem
to
question
the
mystery
of
salt
identity
as
the
flames
began
to
lap
out
of
the
lower
windows
of
trafalgar
chambers
and
it
became
evident
that
their
work
there
was
done
a
stalwart
bodyguard
ranged
themselves
about
his
person
and
headed
the
procession
hurriedly
committing
irene
to
the
loyal
sailor
charge
stobalt
resigned
himself
to
his
position
until
he
could
seize
an
opportunity
discreetly
to
withdraw
not
without
some
form
of
orderliness
the
great
concourse
marched
into
the
broader
streets
stobalt
had
no
idea
of
their
destination
possibly
there
was
no
preconcerted
plan
but
as
such
things
happen
a
single
voice
raised
in
a
pause
gave
the
note
it
did
not
fall
on
barren
ground
and
the
next
minute
the
countless
trampling
feet
moved
to
a
brisker
step
and
the
new
cry
went
rolling
ominously
ahead
to
add
another
terror
to
the
shadowy
phantasmagoria
of
the
streets
to
westminster

the
government

sir
john
hampden
had
not
to
wait
until
the
morning
to
meet
the
deputation
of
ministerialists
again
late
the
same
evening
a
few
men
arriving
together
presented
themselves
at
one
of
the
barricades
that
closed
the
mayfair
street
and
were
at
once
admitted
many
of
the
residential
districts
which
were
not
thoroughfares
for
general
traffic
were
stockaded
in
those
days
and
maintained
their
street
guard
the
local
officials
protested
the
inhabitants
replied
by
instancing
a
few
of
the
cases
where
an
emergency
had
found
the
authorities
powerless
to
extend
protection
and
there
the
matter
ended
it
was
scarcely
worth
while
stamping
out
a
spark
when
they
stood
upon
a
volcano
sir
john
received
the
members
in
the
library
a
disspirited
handful
of
men
who
had
written
their
chapter
of
history
and
were
now
compelled
to
pass
on
the
book
to
other
scribes
as
every
party
must
only
this
party
had
thought
that
it
was
to
be
the
exception
events
are
moving
faster
than
the
clock
apologised
cecil
brown
with
a
rather
dreary
smile
he
was
present
as
the
representative
of
that
body
in
the
house
which
was
not
indisposed
to
be
courteous
and
even
conciliatory
in
attitude
towards
an
opponent
while
it
yielded
nothing
of
its
principles
a
standpoint
unintelligible
to
most
of
the
rank
and
file
of
the
party
doubtless
we
are
not
unexpected
sir
john
hampden
comrade
corrected
a
member
who
was
made
of
sterner
metal
they
were
there
to
deliver
up
their
rifles
but
this
stalwart
soldier
of
equality
clung
tenaciously
to
an
empty
cartridge
case
i
am
no
less
desirous
than
yourselves
of
coming
to
a
settlement
replied
sir
john
if
there
is
still
any
matter
of
detail
the
plenipotentiaries
exchanged
glances
of
some
embarrassment
have
you
not
heard
asked
mr

whose
voice
was
the
voice
of
the
dockyard
labourers
i
can
scarcely
say
until
i
know
what
you
refer
to
was
the
plausible
reply
i
have
found
that
all

has
been
cut
during
the
last
few
hours
he
lightly
indicated
the
instruments
against
the
wall
they
all
looked
towards
cecil
brown
the
matter
being
rather
an
unpleasant
one
the
fact
is
the
house
has
been
invaded
by
a
tumultuous
rabble
they
overcame
all
resistance
by
the
mere
force
of
numbers
and
he
could
not
think
of
a
less
ominous
phrase
at
the
moment
well
simply
turned
us
out
quite
cromwellian
proceedings
we
left
them
passing
very
large
and
comprehensive
resolutions
he
concluded
your
people
said
the
uncompromising
man
accusingly
scarcely
protested
hampden
with
a
smile
the
ends
may
be
the
ends
of
esau
but
the
means
not
our
people
they
could
possibly
be
ours
to
come
and
turn
on
us
like
that
suppose
we
say
without
defining
them
further
said
sir
john
that
they
were
simply
he
paused
for
a
second
to
burn
the
thrust
gently
home
with
a
little
caustic
silence
simply
the
people
mr
vossit
made
a
gesture
of
impatience
towards
his
colleague
whether
queen
anne
died
of
gout
or
apoplexy
is
very
material
now
he
said
with
a
touch
of
bitterness
we
are
here
to
conduct
the
funeral
i
wish
to
meet
you
in
every
possible
way
i
can
interposed
hampden
but
i
must
point
out
to
you
that
at
so
short
a
notice
i
am
deprived
of
the
counsel
of
any
of
my
associates
i
had
hoped
that
by
the
time
of
the
meeting
morning
is
that
necessary
if
the
memorandum
is
accepted
by
the
government
without
discussion
mr
vossit
shrugged
his
shoulders
as
far
as
i
am
concerned
sir
john
the
concession
of
a
word
or
two
or
a
phrase
here
and
there
can
make
no
difference
it
is
our
sedan
and
the
heavier
you
make
the
terms
the
more
there
will
be
for
us
to
remember
it
by
i
am
content
subscribed
mr
guppling
we
have
been
surprised
and
routed
not
by
the
legitimate
tactics
of
party
strife
but
by
methods
undistinguishable
from
those
of
civil
war
hampden
glance
was
raised
mechanically
to
an
inscribed
panel
that
hung
upon
the
wall
in
easy
view
where
it
formed
a
curious
decoration
the
ground
colour
was
dull
black
and
on
it
in
white
lettering
was
set
forth
a
trenchant
sentiment
selected
from
the
public
utterances
of
every
prominent
member
of
the
government
and
labelled
with
his
name
it
was
a
vindication
and
a
spur
that
he
had
kept
before
his
eyes
through
the
years
of
ceaseless
preparation
for
in
each
extract
one
word
was
picked
out
in
the
startling
contrast
of
an
almost
blinding
crimson
and
that
one
word
was
war
even
sir
john
enemies
those
who
called
salt
a
machine
of
blood
and
iron
admitted
him
to
be
a
kindly
gentleman
and
his
glance
had
been
involuntary
for
he
had
no
desire
to
emphasise
defeat
upon
the
vanquished
the
thing
was
done
however
and
following
the
look
every
man
who
sat
there
met
his
own
flamboyant
challenge
from
the
past
for
all
without
exception
had
thrown
down
the
gauntlet
once
in
no
uncertain
form
war
but
that
had
meant
them
waging
war
against
another
when
it
was
quite
convenient
for
them
to
do
so
not
another
waging
war
against
themselves
out
of
season
war
but
certainly
not
war
that
turned
them
out
of
office
only
war
that
turned
their
opponents
out
of
office
the
rather
strained
silence
was
broken
by
the
sound
of
footsteps
approaching
from
the
hall
we
are
still
short
of
the
home
secretary
and
comrade
tirrel
explained
mr
chadwing
to
the
master
of
the
house
we
divided
forces
they
were
driving
i
understand
perhaps
it
was
they
came
in
slowly
for
the
home
secretary
faltered
in
his
gait
and
had
a
hunted
look
while
tirrel
led
him
by
the
arm
both
carried
traces
of
disorder
even
of
conflict
oh
yes
they
held
us
up
said
tirrel
with
a
savage
laugh
as
his
colleagues
gathered
round
he
was
recognised
in
piccadilly
by
a
crowd
of
those
ungrateful
dogs
from
the
pits
i
shouted
to
the
cabman
to
drive
through
them
at
a
gallop
but
the
cur
jumped
off
his
seat
howling
that
he
was
their
friend
i
was
just
able
to
get
the
reins
we
bumped
a
bit
but
did
upset
fortunately
i
left
the
cab
at
the
corner
of
the
street
here
he
turned
his
back
on
the
home
secretary
who
sat
huddled
in
a
chair
and
facing
the
others
made
a
quick
gesture
indicating
that
mr
tubes
was
unwell
and
had
better
be
left
alone
i
brought
him
here
sir
john
he
said
crossing
over
to
the
baronet
and
speaking
in
a
because
i
really
did
not
know
where
else
to
take
him
for
some
reason
he
appears
to
be
almost
execrated
just
now
his
house
in
kilburn
will
be
marked
and
watched
i
am
afraid
and
in
that
respect
i
daresay
we
are
all
in
the
same
boat
he
appears
to
be
ill
said
hampden
rising
i
will
please
do
interrupted
tirrel
decisively
any
kind
of
attention
distresses
him
i
find
it
is
a
collapse
he
has
been
shaken
for
some
time
past
and
the
attack
was
the
climax
his
nerve
is
completely
gone
as
far
as
his
safety
is
concerned
suggested
the
host
with
an
expression
of
compassion
i
think
that
we
can
ensure
that
here
against
any
irregular
force
and
certainly
it
would
be
the
last
place
in
which
they
would
think
of
looking
for
him
for
the
night
at
least
you
had
better
leave
him
in
our
charge
thank
you
said
tirrel
it
is
very
good
of
you
i
will
of
course
he
added
as
he
turned
away
we
shall
have
to
assume
his
acquiescence
to
any
arrangement
we
may
reach
unofficially
i
can
guarantee
it
they
seated
themselves
round
the
large
table
sir
john
and
his
private
secretary
occupying
one
end
the
plenipotentiaries
ranging
around
the
other
three
sides
as
they
took
their
places
mr
drugget
and
another
member
were
announced
they
did
not
appear
to
have
been
expected
but
they
found
seats
among
their
colleagues
the
home
secretary
sat
apart
cowering
in
an
and
stretching
out
his
hands
timorously
from
time
to
time
to
meet
the
radiant
heat
of
the
great
oil
stove
the
composition
of
the
meeting
was
not
quite
the
same
as
that
of
the
deputation
which
had
paved
the
way
to
it
earlier
in
the
day
it
was
more
official
for
the
action
of
the
deputation
had
forced
the
hand
of
the
cabinet
to
the
relief
of
the
majority
of
that
body
it
was
whispered
but
there
was
one
notable
minister
absent
i
represent
the
premier
announced
mr
drugget
rising
if
his
attendance
in
person
can
be
dispensed
with
he
begged
to
be
excused
i
offer
no
objection
replied
hampden
if
in
the
exceptional
circumstances
the
prime
minister
should
desire
to
see
me
privately
i
will
meet
him
elsewhere
the
premier
is
indisposed
i
regret
to
say
in
that
case
i
would
wait
upon
him
at
his
own
house
should
he
desire
it
proffered
sir
john
i
will
convey
to
him
your
offer
replied
mr
drugget
in
the
meantime
i
am
authorised
to
subscribe
mr
strummery
acquiescence
to
the
terms
subject
to
one
modification
one
word
first
please
interposed
sir
john
i
must
repeat
what
i
had
already
said
before
you
arrived
i
am
unable
just
now
to
consult
my
colleagues
in
concert
with
whom
the
memorandum
was
drafted
if
it
is
necessary
to
refer
back
on
any
important
detail
mr
tubes
half
rose
from
his
chair
with
a
pitiable
look
of
terror
in
his
eyes
and
gave
a
low
cry
as
a
turbulent
murmur
from
some
distant
street
reached
his
ears
it
all
right
comrade
said
cecil
brown
reassuringly
you
safe
enough
here
jim
aye
aye
whispered
tubes
fearfully
but
did
you
hear
that
shout
the
they
fling
it
at
me
from
every
crowd
it
haunts
me
that
is
what
i
i
yes
that
is
what
i
fear
no
good
arguing
muttered
tirrel
across
the
table
leave
him
to
himself
there
nothing
else
to
be
done
just
now
i
can
at
least
express
the
premier
views
resumed
mr
drugget
he
would
prefer
the
bill
for
amending
the
franchise
to
be
brought
forward
as
a
private
bill
by
a
member
of
the
opposition
rather
than
make
it
a
government
measure
the
government
would
grant
special
facilities
and
not
oppose
it
the
premier
would
advise
a
dissolution
immediately
the
bill
passed
there
was
a
knock
at
the
library
door
the
secretary
attended
to
it
with
easy
discretion
and
for
a
minute
was
engaged
in
conversation
with
some
one
beyond
sir
john
looked
at
mr
drugget
in
some
amazement
and
most
of
the
members
of
his
own
party
regarded
their
leader
proxy
with
blank
surprise
i
was
hardly
prepared
for
so
fundamental
an
objection
being
raised
at
this
hour
said
the
baronet
it
amounts
of
course
to
bringing
an
alternative
proposal
forward
the
result
would
be
the
same
i
submit
that
it
is
scarcely
more
than
a
matter
of
detail
then
why
press
it
mr
drugget
expression
seemed
to
convey
the
suggestion
that
he
had
no
personal
wishes
at
all
in
the
matter
but
felt
obliged
to
make
the
best
case
he
could
for
his
chief
the
premier
not
unnaturally
desires
that
the
real
authors
of
so
retrogressive
and
tyrannical
an
act
should
be
saddled
with
the
nominal
as
well
as
the
actual
responsibility
he
replied
possibly
he
fears
that
in
some
remote
future
the
circumstances
will
be
forgotten
and
his
name
be
handed
down
as
that
of
a
traitor
the
private
secretary
took
the
opportunity
of
the
sympathetic
murmur
which
this
attitude
evoked
to
exchange
a
sentence
with
sir
john
then
he
turned
to
the
door
and
beckoned
to
the
man
who
stood
outside
i
must
ask
your
indulgence
towards
a
short
interruption
gentlemen
said
hampden
as
a
cyclist
in
grey
uniform
entered
and
handed
him
a
despatch
it
is
possible
that
some
of
my
friends
may
even
now
be
on
their
way
to
join
me
they
all
regarded
the
messenger
with
a
momentary
curious
interest
all
except
two
among
them
over
mr
drugget
and
the
comrade
who
had
arrived
with
him
the
incident
seemed
to
exercise
an
absorbing
fascination
after
a
single
it
almost
seemed
a
startled
glance
at
the
their
eyes
met
in
a
mutual
impulse
and
then
instantly
turned
again
to
fix
on
hampden
face
but
as
tensely
as
though
they
would
tear
the
secret
from
behind
his
unemotional
expression
it
all
very
well
drugget
in
justice
anxiously
murmured
mr
vossit
across
the
table
but
as
things
are
we
got
to
be
quick
and
accept
considerably
less
than
justice
for
heaven
sake
do
prolong
the
agony
after
experience
if
you
hang
on
to
that
warned
mr
guppling
you
will
only
end
in
putting
off
till
not
a
whit
better
terms
than
you
can
make
wait
wait
wait
wait
wait
muttered
mr
drugget
impatiently
not
withdrawing
his
fascinated
gaze
in
the
silence
of
the
room
they
again
heard
the
crescive
ululation
of
the
street
distant
still
but
sounding
louder
than
before
to
their
strained
imagination
and
terrible
in
its
suggestion
of
overwhelming
unappeasable
menace
mr
tubes
started
uneasily
in
his
chair
will
wait
demanded
mr
guppling
with
some
passion
a
very
little
time
longer
your
coming
here
has
thrown
us
out
pleaded
mr
drugget
companion
in
a
more
conciliatory
whisper
morning
a
few
hours
an
hour
perhaps
even
the
messenger
had
been
dismissed
without
an
answer
looking
up
with
sudden
directness
hampden
caught
one
man
eyes
fixed
on
him
with
a
furtive
intensity
that
betrayed
his
hopes
and
fears
the
attack
on
hanwood
has
completely
failed
quietly
announced
sir
john
holding
the
startled
gaze
relentlessly
the
guns
have
been
captured
and
brought
in
the
troops
have
been
surrounded
disarmed
and
dispersed
with
the
exception
of
those
of
the
higher
rank
who
are
detained
there
have
unfortunately
been
casualties
on
both
sides
i
i
i
why
do
you
address
yourself
to
me
sir
john
stammered
the
disconcerted
man
turning
very
white
and
exhibiting
every
painful
sign
of
guilt
and
apprehension
are
we
to
understand
that
your
property
at
hanwood
has
been
attacked
by
an
armed
force
of
regulars
asked
one
with
sincere
incredulity
as
hampden
remained
silent
it
is
unhappily
true
and
defended
by
an
evidently
superior
force
of
armed
men
unlawfully
assembled
there
retorted
a
militant
comrade
defiantly
in
view
of
the
strained
position
to
which
the
circumstances
must
give
rise
i
will
take
the
responsibility
of
withdrawing
the
premier
one
objection
to
the
memorandum
as
it
stands
announced
mr
drugget
with
dry
lips
in
that
case
i
will
ask
mr
lloyd
to
read
the
terms
of
the
agreement
formally
before
we
append
our
signatures
said
hampden
without
offering
any
further
comment
a
printed
copy
of
the
articles
was
passed
to
each
delegate
on
the
table
before
sir
john
lay
the
engrossed
form
in
duplicate
from
one
of
these
the
secretary
proceeded
to
read
the
terms
of
the
agreement
which
was
frankly
recognised
on
both
sides
as
the
of
socialistic
ascendency
in
england
from
the
government
the
league
required
only
one
thing
the
immediate
passing
of
a
bill
to
amend
the
qualifications
of
voters
in
parliamentary
elections
to
be
followed
by
a
dissolution
and
its
inevitable
consequence
a
general
election
but
of
the
result
of
that
election
no
one
need
cherish
any
illusions
for
it
would
be
decided
according
to
the
new
qualification
and
shorn
of
its
parliamentary
phraseology
the
new
act
was
to
sweep
away
the
existing
adult
suffrage
and
broadly
substitute
for
it
a
occupation
qualification
with
still
worse
a
plurality
of
voting
power
in
multiples
of
according
to
the
rateable
value
of
the
premises
occupied
it
was
wholly
immoral
according
to
the
democratic
tendency
of
the
preceding
age
but
it
was
wholly
necessary
according
to
the
situation
which
had
resulted
from
it
a
genial
autocrat
professor
and
poet
has
set
forth
in
one
of
his
works
for
the
sake
of
the
warning
it
conveys
the
story
of
a
little
boy
who
on
coming
into
the
possession
of
a
nice
silver
watch
and
examining
it
closely
discovered
among
the
works
a
confounded
little
entangled
round
the
of
course
his
first
care
was
to
remove
this
palpable
obstruction
with
the
result
that
the
watch
accomplished
the
work
of
hours
in
an
insignificant
fraction
of
a
second
and
then
refused
to
have
anything
more
to
do
with
practical
chronometry
on
coming
into
possession
of
their
new
toy
the
socialists
had
discovered
many
confounded
little
wrapped
away
among
the
works
of
that
elaborate
piece
of
machinery
the
english
constitution
all
obviously
impeding
its
free
working
recklessly
even
gaily
they
had
pulled
them
out
one
after
another
cut
them
across
the
middle
and
left
pieces
hanging
if
they
could
not
find
the
ends
dragged
out
lengths
anyhow
for
a
time
the
effect
had
been
dazzlingly
when
seen
from
below
the
constitution
had
gone
very
very
very
fast
it
had
covered
centuries
in
a
few
years
and
as
it
went
it
got
faster
but
unfortunately
it
had
stopped
suddenly
and
every
one
saw
that
while
it
remained
in
the
hands
of
its
nominal
masters
it
would
never
go
again
had
the
times
been
less
critical
some
other
means
of
effecting
the
same
end
might
have
been
found
but
although
it
was
scarcely
more
than
whispered
yet
for
four
hours
england
had
been
involved
in
actual
deadly
civil
war
and
water
once
spilled
is
hard
to
gather
up
under
ordinary
circumstances
the
expedient
of
disenfranchising
a
party
would
have
proved
unpopular
even
with
the
bitterest
among
that
enemies
as
it
was
it
was
simply
accepted
as
the
necessary
counterstroke
to
their
own
policy
of
aggression
if
the
government
of
modern
times
can
instance
a
single
business
where
eleven
shareholders
to
the
amount
of
a
sovereign
apiece
can
come
in
and
outvote
ten
shareholders
who
have
each
a
stake
of
a
thousand
pounds
in
the
concern
and
then
proceed
to
wreck
it
was
a
remark
typical
of
the
view
people
took
then
why
then
the
record
of
the
government
will
lose
its
distinction
as
an
absolutely
unique
blend
of
fatuous
imbecility
and
ramping
injustice
that
all
so
there
was
to
be
a
general
election
very
soon
in
which
the
issue
would
lie
between
the
league
party
and
the
shattered
shipwrecked
administration
that
had
no
leaders
no
coherence
and
scarcely
a
name
to
rally
to
it
was
estimated
that
labour
of
one
complexion
or
another
might
hold
between
thirty
and
forty
seats
if
the
working
classes
cared
to
support
representatives
after
the
payment
of
members
act
had
been
repealed
it
was
computed
that
in
more
than
four
hundred
constituencies
league
candidates
would
be
returned
unopposed
there
could
be
no
denying
that
our
countrymen
of
lived
through
an
interesting
period
of
their
country
history
the
league
party
would
go
to
the
poll
with
no
pledges
and
their
policy
for
the
present
was
summed
up
in
the
single
phrase
as
in
it
was
to
be
the
cleanest
of
slates
how
soon
can
the
bill
become
law
under
the
most
expeditious
handling
hampden
had
asked
of
those
who
formed
the
earlier
deputation
and
the
answer
had
been
three
days
solely
from
the
business
point
of
view
it
was
magnificent
and
it
was
certainly
convenient
as
matters
stood
in
three
more
days
a
general
election
could
be
in
full
swing
waged
in
the
emergency
on
the
existing
register
supplemented
by
the
books
of
the
local
authorities
and
the
voters
receipts
for
rates
or
taxes
in
a
single
day
it
could
be
over
within
a
week
england
would
have
experienced
a
change
in
her
affairs
as
as
the
conquest
or
the
restoration

the
first
article
to
the
breathless
assembly
it
had
been
tacitly
agreed
that
the
time
had
come
when
the
conditions
must
be
accepted
without
discussion
but
when
the
fateful
clause
was
finished
a
deep
groan
not
in
empty
hostile
demonstration
but
irresistibly
torn
from
the
unfeigned
depths
of
their
emotion
escaped
many
of
the
ministers

el
sigh
when
he
reached
the
point
where
the
towers
and
minarets
of

were
lost
to
him

not
more
sincere
or
even
sir
john
could
not
have
claimed
that
he
felt
unmoved
the
secretary

on
the

into
certain
undertakings
it
guaranteed
that
the
normal
conditions
of
the
home

should
be
restored
and
the
men
called
back
to
the
pits
by

immediate
order

kinds

as
fast
as

could

there
were
many
other
points
of
detail
and
they
all
had
a
common
aim
the
obliteration
of
the
immediate
past
and
the
restoration
of
that
public
confidence
which
in
a
country
possessing
natural
resources
is
the
foundation
stone
of
national
prosperity
already
there
were
facts
for
the
present
and
portents
for
the
future
men
of
influence
and
position
who
had
been
driven
out
of
england
by
the
terrible
atmosphere
of
political
squalor
cast
over
an
empire
by
a
government
that
had
learned
to
think
municipally

even
now
beginning
to
return
and
that
most
responsive
seismograph
which
faithfully
reflected
every
change
in

world
condition
for
good
or
ill
predicted
better
times
in
other
words
consols
had
risen
in
three
months
from
to
and
the
bulk
of
the
buying
was
said
to
be
for
investment
if
it
is
not
trenching
on
the
forbidden
ground
i
should
like
to
ask
for
an
assurance
on
one
point
said
a
member
with
a
dash
of
acrimony
the
secretary
had
finished
his
task
and
then
for
perhaps
ten
seconds
they
had
sat
in
silence
speculating
half
unconsciously
upon
the
future
as
each
dimly
saw
it
that
lay
beyond
the
momentous
step
they
were
about
to
take
i
refer
to
the
question
of
coal
export
it
is
of
course
a
more
important
outlet
than
the
domestic
home
consumption
is
the
league
in
a
position
to
guarantee
that
the
taxation
will
be
rescinded
without
delay
i
think
it
would
be
a
very
unwarrantable
presumption
for
us
to
assume
that
any
one
outside
the
governments
of
the
countries
interested
possesses
that
influence
and
that
it
would
be
a
very
undesirable
a
very
undiplomatic
proceeding
to
hint
at
the
possibility
of
any
such
concession
in
the
document
i
have
before
me
replied
sir
john
suavely
beyond
that
i
would
add
that
it
will
be
manifestly
to
the
interest
of
the
next
government
to
restore
the
bulk
of
foreign
trade
to
a
normal
level
and
that
should
the
league
party
find
itself
in
office
it
will
certainly
make
representations
through
the
usual
channels
quite
like
old
times
said
mr
soans
dryly
i
suppose
that
we
shall
have
to
be
content
with
that
let
us
hope
that
it
will
prove
a
true
saying
that
those
who
hide
can
find
he
picked
up
a
pen
as
he
finished
speaking
signed
the
paper
that
had
been
passed
to
him
first
by
reason
of
his
position
at
the
table
and
thrust
it
vehemently
from
him
to
his
neighbour
mr
chadwing
held
up
his
pen
to
the
light
to
make
sure
that
it
contained
no
obstruction
on
so
important
an
occasion
signed
his
name
with
clerkly
precision
and
then
carefully
wiped
his
pen
on
the
lining
of
his
coat
cecil
brown
looked
down
with
the
faint
smile
that
covered
his
saddest
moments
as
he
added
the
slender
strokes
of
his
signature
and
tirrel
dashed
off
the
characters
of
his
with
tightened
lips
and
a
sombre
frown
consciously
or
unconsciously
every
man
betrayed
some
touch
of
character
in
that
act
mr
vossit
made
a
wry
grimace
as
he
passed
the
paper
on
and
mr
guppling
with
an
eye
on
a
possible
line
in
fame
calendar
snapped
his
traitorous
pen
in
two
and
cast
the
pieces
dramatically
to
the
ground
when
the
last
signature
had
been
written
some
of
the
members
stood
up
to
take
their
leave
at
once
but
hampden
and
tirrel
made
a
simultaneous
motion
to
detain
them
the
master
of
the
house
gave
way
to
his
guest
i
am
not
up
to
cry
over
spilled
milk
said
tirrel
with
his
customary
bluntness
what
is
done
is
done
we
shall
carry
out
the
terms
sir
john
hampden
and
you
and
your
party
will
be
in
office
in
a
week
but
you
are
not
merely
taking
over
the
administration
of
a
constitution
you
are
taking
over
a
defeated
country
i
ask
you
as
the
head
of
your
party
and
the
future
premier
to
do
one
thing
and
i
ask
it
entirely
on
my
own
initiative
and
without
the
suggestion
or
even
the
knowledge
of
my
friends
or
colleagues
let
your
first
act
be
to
publish
a
general
amnesty
it
does
not
touch
me
but
there
have
been
things
on
both
sides
you
may
perhaps
know
my
views
i
would
have
crushed
your
league
by
strong
means
when
it
was
possible
if
i
had
had
my
way
none
the
less
there
is
not
the
most
shadowy
charge
that
could
hang
over
me
and
for
that
reason
it
is
permissible
for
me
to
put
in
this
petition
the
nation
is
shattered
torn
helpless
do
not
look
too
closely
into
the
past
pacify
the
question
has
not
arisen
between
my
associates
and
myself
but
i
do
not
imagine
that
we
should
hold
conflicting
views
and
i
may
say
that
for
my
part
i
enter
cordially
into
the
spirit
of
the
suggestion
replied
hampden
frankly
anything
irregular
that
could
come
within
the
meaning
of
political
action
in
its
widest
sense
i
should
be
favourable
towards
making
the
object
of
a
general
pardon
while
we
are
together
i
will
go
a
step
further
and
on
this
point
i
have
the
expressed
agreement
of
my
friends
you
sir
have
assumed
without
any
reserve
that
our
party
will
be
returned
to
office
i
accept
that
assumption
you
have
also
compared
our
work
to
the
pacification
of
a
conquered
nation
that
also
may
be
largely
admitted
we
shall
be
less
a
political
party
returned
to
power
by
the
even
chances
of
a
election
and
checked
by
an
alert
opposition
than
a
social
autocracy
imposing
our
wishes
as
we
believe
for
the
public
good
on
the
country
for
twenty
years
as
i
forecast
the
future
there
will
be
no
effective
opposition
yet
a
great
deal
of
our
work
will
have
reference
to
the
class
whom
the
opposition
would
represent
the
class
upon
whose
wise
and
statesmanlike
pacification
the
tranquillity
and
largely
the
prosperity
of
the
country
will
depend
some
few
began
to
catch
the
drift
of
hampden
meaning
and
those
who
did
all
glanced
instinctively
towards
cecil
brown
you
have
used
and
i
have
accepted
the
comparison
of
a
conquered
nation
continued
sir
john
when
a
country
has
been
forcibly
occupied
the
work
of
pacification
is
one
of
the
first
taken
in
hand
by
a
prudent
conqueror
there
is
usually
a
board
or
committee
of
conciliation
and
in
that
body
are
to
be
found
some
of
the
foremost
of
those
who
resisted
invasion
while
resistance
seemed
availing
it
would
be
analogous
to
that
in
my
opinion
if
a
supporter
of
the
present
government
was
offered
and
accepted
a
position
in
the
next
there
would
be
no
suggestion
there
would
be
no
possibility
of
his
being
in
accord
with
the
cabinet
in
its
general
policy
he
would
be
there
as
an
expert
to
render
service
to
both
parties
in
the
work
of
healing
the
scars
of
conflict
if
the
proposal
appears
to
be
exceptional
and
the
position
untenable
at
first
sight
it
is
only
because
the
prosaic
parliamentary
machinery
of
normal
times
has
by
a
miracle
been
preserved
into
times
that
are
abnormal
there
was
an
infection
of
low
laughter
amused
sardonic
some
and
a
little
and
a
few
cries
of
cecil
brown
in
a
subdued
key
the
moment
seemed
a
favourable
one
for
laying
the
proposal
before
the
members
of
the
government
went
on
hampden
unmoved
though
of
course
i
do
not
expect
an
answer
now
on
the
assumption
that
we
are
returned
to
power
it
is
our
intention
to
create
a
new
department
to
exist
as
long
as
the
conditions
require
it
and
certainly
as
long
as
the
next
parliament
its
work
will
be
largely
conciliation
and
it
will
deal
with
the
disorganisation
of
labour
in
the
same
confidential
spirit
with
which
you
have
spoken
of
the
future
without
reserve
i
may
say
that
should
i
be
called
upon
to
form
a
ministry
i
shall
and
i
have
the
definite
acquiescence
of
my
colleagues
offer
the
presidentship
of
the
board
to
mr
cecil
brown
the
office
of
parliamentary
secretary
to
mr
tirrel
if
hampden
had
wished
to
surprise
he
certainly
succeeded
the
open
laugh
that
greeted
the
first
name
was
cut
off
as
suddenly
and
completely
as
the
light
is
cut
off
when
the
is
turned
by
the
gasp
that
the
second
name
evoked
to
many
among
them
the
offer
had
been
the
merest
party
move
cecil
brown
name
a
foregone
conclusion
the
addition
of
tirrel
whose
rather
brilliant
qualities
and
quite
fantastic
sense
of
honour
they
were
prone
to
lose
sight
of
behind
his
vehement
was
stupefying
it
was
tirrel
who
was
the
first
to
break
the
silence
of
astonishment
on
this
occasion
not
even
waiting
with
characteristic
impetuousness
for
his
to
offer
an
opinion
you
say
that
you
do
not
want
an
answer
now
sir
john
but
you
may
have
it
as
far
as
i
am
concerned
he
cried
with
the
defiant
air
that
marked
his
controversial
passages
from
any
other
man
of
your
party
the
proposal
would
have
been
an
insult
from
you
it
is
an
amiable
mistake
do
not
think
that
you
can
buy
us
with
the
bribe
of
office
but
you
think
that
there
is
no
further
party
work
for
us
to
do
that
socialism
in
england
is
dead
i
tell
you
sir
john
hampden
with
the
absolute
conviction
of
an
inspired
truth
that
it
will
triumph
yet
you
will
not
see
it
i
may
not
see
it
but
it
is
more
likely
that
the
hand
of
time
itself
should
fail
than
that
the
ideals
to
which
we
cling
should
cease
to
draw
men
on
we
who
are
the
earliest
pioneers
of
that
untrodden
path
have
made
many
mistakes
we
are
paying
for
them
now
but
we
have
learned
some
of
our
mistakes
have
brought
want
and
suffering
to
thousands
of
your
class
but
for
hundreds
of
years
your
mistakes
have
been
bringing
starvation
and
misery
to
millions
of
our
class
from
your
presence
we
go
down
again
into
the
weary
years
of
bondage
to
work
silently
and
unmarked
among
those
depths
of
human
misery
from
which
our
charter
springs
i
warn
you
sir
john
hampden
for
i
know
that
the
warning
will
be
dead
and
forgotten
before
the
year
is
out
that
our
reign
will
come
again
and
when
the
star
of
a
new
and
purified
socialism
arises
once
more
on
a
prepared
and
receptive
world
the
very
forces
of
nature
would
not
be
strong
enough
to
arrest
its
triumphant
course
hear
hear
said
mr
vossit
perfunctorily
as
he
looked
round
solicitously
for
his
hat
well
i
suppose
we
may
as
well
be
going
cecil
brown
recalled
his
wistful
smile
from
the
contemplation
of
a
future
chequered
with
many
scenes
of
light
and
shade
i
thank
you
sir
john
he
replied
with
a
look
of
friendly
understanding
but
i
also
must
go
down
with
my
own
party
i
hope
that
the
decision
in
neither
case
will
be
irrevocable
said
hampden
with
regret
but
as
he
spoke
he
knew
that
the
hope
was
vain
they
had
already
begun
to
file
out
of
the
room
with
a
touch
here
and
there
of
that
air
of
constraint
that
the
party
had
never
been
quite
able
to
shake
off
on
ceremonial
occasions
they
left
mr
tubes
cowering
before
the
stove
and
raising
his
head
nervously
from
time
to
time
to
listen
to
the
noises
of
the
street
mr
guppling
determined
that
his
claims
should
not
escape
the
eye
of
fame
paused
at
the
door
when
we
leave
this
room
john
hampden
he
proclaimed
in
a
loud
and
impressive
voice
and
throwing
out
his
hand
with
an
appropriate
gesture
we
leave
liberty
behind
us
bound
gagged
and
helpless
on
the
floor
very
true
mr
guppling
replied
sir
john
we
will
devote
our
first
efforts
to
releasing
her
mr
guppling
smiled
a
bitter
cutting
smile
and
left
the
shaft
to
rankle
it
was
not
until
he
was
out
in
the
street
that
a
sense
of
the
possible
ambiguity
of
his
unfortunate
remark
overwhelmed
him
with
disgust
chapter
xxii
poor
england
with
the
account
of
the
signing
of
the
dissolution
terms
and
a
brief
reference
to
the
sweeping
victory
of
the
league
party
already
foreshadowed
indeed
to
the
point
of
the
inevitable
the
unknown
chronicler
whose
version
of
the
social
war
this
narrative
has
followed
brings
his
annals
to
a
close
that
war
being
finished
and
by
the
repudiation
of
their
socialistic
mentors
on
the
part
of
a
large
section
of
the
working
classes
finished
by
more
than
a
mere
paper
treaty
the
worthy
scribe
announces
with
praiseworthy
restraint
that
there
is
no
more
to
be
said
these
men
he
declares
in
the
quaint
and
archaic
language
of
the
past
and
he
might
surely
have
added
these
women
also
came
not
reluctantly
but
in
no
wise
ambitiously
out
of
the
business
of
their
own
private
lives
to
serve
their
country
as
they
deemed
and
that
being
accomplished
to
a
successful
end
would
have
returned
nothing
loth
to
more
obscure
affairs
having
sought
no
personal
gain
beyond
that
which
grew
from
public
security
an
equitable
burden
of
citizenship
and
a
recovered
pride
among
the
nations
albeit
some
must
needs
remain
to
carry
on
the
work
even
the
not
unimportant
detail
of
who
remained
to
carry
on
the
work
and
in
what
capacities
is
not
recorded
but
the
distribution
of
rewards
and
penalties
on
the
lines
of
strict
poetic
justice
may
be
safely
left
to
the
individual
reader
sympathies
with
the
definite
assurance
that
everything
happened
exactly
as
he
would
have
it
at
the
length
of
three
times
as
much
space
as
would
have
sufficed
to
dispose
of
these
points
once
and
for
all
this
superexact
historian
goes
on
to
set
out
his
reasons
for
not
doing
so
he
claims
in
short
that
his
object
was
to
portray
the
course
of
the
social
war
not
to
recount
the
adventures
of
mere
individuals
and
with
the
suggestion
of
a
wink
between
his
pen
and
paper
that
may
raise
a
doubt
whether
he
on
his
side
might
not
be
endowed
with
the
power
of
casting
a
critical
eye
upon
other
periods
than
his
own
he
indulges
in
a
little
pleasantry
at
the
expense
of
writers
who
under
the
pretext
of
developing
their
hero
character
begin
with
his
parent
childhood
and
continue
to
the
time
of
his
youth
for
himself
he
asserts
that
nothing
apart
from
the
course
of
the
social
war
its
rise
and
progress
has
been
allowed
to
intrude
and
that
ended
and
their
work
accomplished
its
champions
are
rather
heroically
treated
very
much
as
the
arabian
magician
army
was
disposed
of
until
it
was
required
again
and
to
all
intents
and
purposes
turned
into
stone
just
where
they
stood
but
from
other
sources
it
is
possible
to
glean
a
little
here
and
there
of
the
course
of
subsequent
events
to
this
patchwork
record
the
contributes

laden
with
the

a

sentiment
driven
home
by

hint
that
for

west

france
france
who
had
been
so
chivalrously
true
to
her
own
ally
in
that
stricken
giant
day
of
incredible
humiliation
looked
across
the
sleeve
with
troubled
anxious
eyes
and
whispered
words
of
sympathy
and
hope
gently
very
tactfully
she
offered
friendship
with
both
hands
without
a
tinge
of
the
patronage
or
protection
that
she
could
extend
and
by
the
living
example
of
her
own
tempestuous
past
and
gallant
recovery
from
every
blow
pointed
the
way
to
power
and
japan
whose
treaty
had
been
thrown
unceremoniously
back
to
her
many
years
before
now
drew
near
again
with
the
cheerful
smile
that
is
so
mild
in
peace
so
terrible
in
war
prefacing
that
her
own
enviable
position
was
entirely
due
to
the
enlightened
virtues
of
her
emperor
she
now
proposed
another
compact
on
broad
and
generous
lines
by
which
england
a
high
contracting
power
as
she
was
still
magnanimously
described
was
spared
the
most
fruitful
cause
for
anxiety
in
the
east
you
did
mind
allying
with
us
when
you
were
at

japan
we
come
to
you
now
besides
all
very
good
business
for
us
in
the
end
you
build
up
again
all
right
no
time
japan
authority
to
speak
on
the
subject
of
building
up
was
not
to
be
disputed
the
nations
had
forgotten
the
time
scarcely
a
quarter
of
a
century
before
when
they
had
been
amused
by
little
japan
progressive
ambitions
and
when
japan
had
taken
over
the
awakening
arrangements
of
a
on
terms
that
gave
her
fifty
million
potential
warriors
to
draw
upon
and
train
warriors
whom
one
of
england
most
revered
generals
had
characterised
as
easily
led
easily
fed
fearless
of
death
in
some
quarters
gave
way
to
positive
trepidation
the
sympathetic
nations
spoke
together
and
agreed
that
something
must
be
done
to
give
poor
england
another
chance
as
in
the
world
of
commerce
friendly
rivals
will
often
gather
round
the
man
who
has
fallen
on
evil
days
to
set
him
on
his
feet
again
so
england
was
to
have
a
fair
field
and
liberty
to
work
out
her
own
salvation
but
she
was
not
to
wake
up
and
find
that
it
had
all
been
a
hideous
dream
egypt
had
been
put
back
to
the
time
of
the
khalifa
india
had
lost
sixty
years
of
pacification
and
progress
ireland
was
a
republic
at
least
in
name
and
depending
largely
on
commemoration
issues

stamps
for
a
revenue
south
africa
was
for
the
south
africans
there
were
many
other
interesting
items
but
these
were
as
it
might
be
expressed
to
a
nation
of
shopkeepers
the
leading
lines
if
the
worst
abroad
was
bad
enough
there
was
one
encouraging
feature
at
home
with
the
election
of
the
new
government
industries
began
to
revive
trade
to
improve
the
money
market
to
throw
off
its
depression
and
the
natural
demand
for
labour
to
increase
not
gradually
but
instantly
phenomenally
it
was
as
though
a
dam
across
some
great
river
had
been
removed
and
with
the
impetus
every
sluggish
little
tributary
was
quickened
and
drawn
on
in
new
and
sparkling
animation
it
was
not
necessary
to
argue
upon
it
from
a
party
point
of
view
it
was
a
concrete
fact
that
every
one
admitted
there
was
only
one
explanation
and
it
met
the
eye
at
every
turn
capital
reappeared
and
money
began
to
circulate
freely
again
why
there
was
security
it
was
not
the
millennium
it
was
the
year
and
a
capitalistic
government
was
in
office
but
the
masses
discovered
that
they
were
certainly
not
worse
off
than
before
working
men
now
wore
it
is
true
a
little
less
of
the
air
of
being
so
many
presidents
of
south
american
republics
when
they
walked
about
the
streets
but
that
style
had
never
really
suited
them
and
they
soon
got
out
of
it
the
men
who
had
come
into
power
were
not
of
the
class
who
oppress
the
strife
of
the
past
was
being
forgotten
its
lessons
were
remembered
what
was
good
and
practical
of
socialistic
legislation
was
retained
so
it
came
about
that
the
vanquished
gained
more
by
defeat
than
they
would
have
done
by
victory
it
was
undeniable
that
in
common
with
mankind
at
large
they
still
from
time
to
time
experienced
pain
sickness
disappointment
hardship
and
general
adversity
those
who
were
employed
by
gentlemen
were
treated
as
gentlemen
treat
their
those
who
were
so
unfortunate
as
to
be
in
the
service
of
employers
who
had
no
claim
to
that
title
continued
to
be
treated
as
cads
and
despots
treat
their
employés
those
among
them
who
were
gentlemen
themselves
extended
a
courteous
spirit
towards
their
masters
and
those
among
them
who
were
the
reverse
continued
to
act
towards
employers
and
the
world
around
as
churls
and
blusterers
act
and
so
the
compensating
balance
of
nature
was
more
or
less
harmoniously
preserved
and
what
of
the
future
will
the
nation
that
was
so
sharply
taught
dread
the
fire
like
the
burned
child
or
return
to
the
flame
as
the
scorched
moth
does
alas
the
memory
of
a
people
is
short
even
as
the
wisdom
of
a
proverb
is
conflictingly
or
if
the
warning
fades
and
the
necessity
grows
large
again
will
there
be
found
another
stobalt
to
respond
to
the
call
for
those
whom
heaven
afflicts
there
is
a
chance
contributes
the
sage
of
another
land
but
they
who
persistently
work
out
their
own
undoing
are
indeed
hopeless
or
may
it
be
that
the
faith
of
tirrel
will
be
justified
and
that
in
the
process
of
time
there
will
emerge
from
man
ceaseless
groping
after
perfection
a
new
wisdom
under
whose
yet
scheme

dispensation
all
men
will
be
