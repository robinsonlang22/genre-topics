dark
hints
all
things
considered
i
rate
october
as
the
most
momentous
day
of
my
life
why
it
should
be
so
styled
is
not
at
once
apparent
my
career
has
not
been
unromantic
during
many
years
i
have
rambled
over
the
globe
courting
danger
wherever
interest
led
me
and
later
on
have
splashed
through
shambles
such
as
revolutions
have
seldom
before
been
red
with
more
than
once
i
have
tripped
near
the
cave
where
death
lies
in
ambush
i
am
now
an
old
man
but
my
memory
is
green
and
vigorous
i
can
look
back
calmly
on
the
varied
spectacle
of
life
and
weigh
each
event
impartially
in
the
balance
and
thus
looking
i
refer
my
most
fateful
experience
to
an
hour
during
an
afternoon
conversation
in
my
dull
dingy
quarters
in
bayswater
from
romance
to
the
commonplace
is
seldom
a
long
trudge
on
this
occasion
a
quite
commonplace
letter
determined
my
destiny
there
was
nothing
of
any
gravity
in
the
letter
itself
it
was
a
mere
invitation
to
meet
some
friends
most
people
would
stare
vacantly
were
i
to
show
it
to
them
they
would
stare
still
more
vacantly
were
i
to
say
that
it
enabled
me
to
write
this
terrible
story
bear
in
mind
however
that
a
lever
insignificant
in
itself
switches
an
express
train
off
one
track
on
to
another
in
a
like
manner
a
very
insignificant
letter
switched
me
off
from
the
tracks
of
an
ordinary
mortal
into
those
of
the
companion
and
biographer
of
a
nero
some
two
years
before
the
time
of
which
i
write
i
had
returned
to
london
having
completed
a
series
of
adventurous
travels
in
africa
and
asia
my
foregoing
career
is
easily
briefed
left
an
orphan
of
very
tender
years
i
had
grown
up
under
the
ægis
of
a
bachelor
uncle
one
of
those
singularly
men
who
rescue
humanity
from
the
cynics
he
had
always
treated
me
as
his
own
son
had
given
me
the
advantages
of
a
sterling
education
and
had
finally
crowned
his
benevolence
by
adopting
me
as
his
heir
an
inveterate
politician
he
had
early
initiated
me
into
the
mysteries
of
his
cult
and
it
is
probably
to
his
guidance
that
i
owed
much
of
my
later
enthusiasm
for
reform
as
a
youngster
of
i
could
not
however
be
expected
to
abandon
myself
to
and
statistics
and
was
indeed
much
more
intent
on
amusement
than
anything
else
among
my
chief
passions
was
that
of
travel
a
pursuit
which
gratified
both
the
acquired
interests
of
culture
and
the
natural
lust
of
adventure
of
the
raptures
of
the
rambler
i
accordingly
drank
my
fill
forwarding
in
dutiful
fashion
long
accounts
of
my
tours
to
my
indulgent
relative
altogether
i
spent
three
or
four
years
harvesting
rich
experience
in
this
manner
i
was
preparing
for
a
journey
through
syria
when
i
received
a
telegram
from
my
uncle
s
doctor
urging
me
immediately
to
return
being
then
at
alexandria
i
made
all
haste
to
comply
with
it
only
however
to
discover
the
appeal
too
well
grounded
and
the
goal
of
my
journey
a
i
mourned
for
my
uncle
s
loss
sincerely
and
my
natural
regrets
were
sharpened
when
his
will
was
read
with
the
exception
of
a
few
insignificant
bequests
he
had
transferred
his
entire
property
to
me
the
period
of
mourning
over
i
was
free
to
indulge
my
whims
to
the
utmost
and
might
well
have
been
regarded
as
full
of
schemes
for
a
life
of
wild
adventure
delay
however
had
created
novel
interests
some
papers
i
had
published
had
been
warmly
welcomed
by
critics
and
a
new
literary
and
itself
out
seductively
before
me
further
i
had
by
this
time
seen
many
cities
and
men
and
the
problem
of
civilization
began
to
appeal
to
me
with
commanding
interest
the
teachings
also
of
my
uncle
had
duly
yielded
their
harvest
and
ere
long
i
threw
myself
into
politics
with
the
same
zeal
which
had
carried
me
through
the
african
forests
and
over
the
dreary
burning
sands
of
araby
i
became
first
a
radical
of
my
uncle
s
school
then
a
labour
advocate
and
socialist
and
lastly
had
aspired
to
the
eminence
of
parliamentary
candidate
for
stepney
a
word
on
the
political
situation
things
had
been
looking
very
black
in
the
closing
years
of
the
last
century
but
the
pessimists
of
that
epoch
were
the
optimists
of
ours
london
even
in
the
old
days
was
a
bloated
unwieldy
city
an
abode
of
smoke
and
dreariness
startled
from
time
to
time
by
the
angry
murmurs
of
labour
in
this
colossus
of
cities
held
nigh
six
million
souls
and
the
social
problems
of
the
past
were
intensified
the
circle
of
competence
was
wider
but
beyond
it
stretched
a
restless
and
dreaded
democracy
commerce
had
received
a
sharp
check
after
the
late
continental
wars
and
the
depression
was
severely
felt
that
bad
times
were
coming
was
the
settled
conviction
of
the
middle
classes
and
to
this
belief
was
due
the
coalition
government
that
held
sway
during
the
year
in
which
my
story
opens
in
many
quarters
a
severe
reaction
had
set
in
against
liberalism
and
a
stronger
executive
and
repressive
laws
were
urgently
clamoured
for
at
the
opposite
extreme
flew
the
red
flag
and
a
social
revolution
was
eagerly
mooted
i
myself
though
a
socialist
was
averse
to
barricades
not
revolution
but
evolution
was
the
watchword
of
my
section
dumont
has
said
that
the
only
period
when
one
can
undertake
great
legislative
reforms
is
that
in
which
the
public
passions
are
calm
and
in
which
the
government
enjoys
the
greatest
of
the
importance
of
this
truth
i
was
firmly
convinced
what
was
socialism
the
nationalization
of
land
and
capital
of
the
means
of
production
and
distribution
in
the
interests
of
a
vast
industrial
army
and
how
were
the
details
of
this
vast
change
to
be
grappled
with
amid
the
throes
of
revolution
how
deliberate
with
streets
slippery
with
blood
the
vilest
passions
unchained
stores
factories
and
workshops
wrecked
and
perhaps
a
starving
populace
to
conciliate
what
man
or
convention
could
beat
out
a
workable
constitution
in
the
turmoil
what
guarantee
had
we
against
a
reaction
and
a
military
saviour
by
all
means
i
argued
have
a
revolution
if
a
revolution
is
both
a
necessary
and
safe
prelude
of
reform
but
was
it
really
necessary
or
even
safe
feeling
ran
high
in
this
dispute
many
a
time
was
i
attacked
for
my
lukewarmness
of
conviction
by
socialists
but
never
did
i
hear
my
objections
fairly
met
though
on
good
terms
with
the
advanced
party
as
a
whole
i
was
opposed
at
stepney
by
an
extremist
as
well
as
by
the
sitting
conservative
member
my
chances
of
election
were
poor
but
victorious
or
not
i
meant
to
battle
vigorously
for
principle
to
a
certain
extent
my
perseverance
bore
good
fruit
during
the
last
month
i
had
been
honoured
with
the
representation
of
an
important
body
at
a
forthcoming
paris
convention
and
was
in
fact
on
the
eve
of
starting
on
my
journey
there
was
no
immediate
call
for
departure
but
the
prospect
of
a
pleasant
holiday
in
france
proved
overwhelmingly
seductive
the
socialist
congress
was
fixed
for
october
and
i
proposed
to
enjoy
the
interval
in
true
sybaritic
fashion
perhaps
my
eagerness
to
start
was
not
unconnected
with
a
tenderer
subject
than
either
rambling
or
politics
happily
or
unhappily
however
these
dispositions
were
about
to
receive
short
shrift
it
was
a
raw
dismal
afternoon
the
grim
buildings
the
dripping
vehicles
and
the
dusky
pedestrians
below
reminding
one
forcibly
of
the
city
of
dreadful
memories
of
schopenhauer
and
thomson
floated
slowly
across
my
mind
and
the
gathering
shadows
around
seemed
fraught
with
a
gentle
melancholy
having
some
two
hours
before
me
i
drew
my
chair
to
the
window
and
abandoned
myself
wholly
to
thought
what
my
meditations
were
matters
very
little
but
i
remember
being
vigorously
recalled
to
reality
by
a
smart
blow
on
the
shoulder
no
stanley
my
boy
it
s
no
won
t
look
your
i
looked
up
with
a
laugh
a
stalwart
individual
with
a
thick
black
beard
and
singularly
resolute
face
had
broken
upon
my
solitude
this
worthy
whose
acquaintance
we
shall
improve
hereafter
was
no
other
than
john
burnett
journalist
and
agitator
a
man
of
the
most
advanced
revolutionary
opinions
in
fact
an
apostle
of
what
is
generally
known
as
anarchical
communism
no
law
no
force
reference
of
all
social
energies
to
voluntary
association
of
individuals
were
his
substitutes
for
the
executive
of
the
socialists
he
made
no
secret
of
his
meant
to
wage
war
in
every
effective
mode
violent
or
otherwise
against
the
existing
social
system
though
strongly
opposed
to
the
theories
i
was
not
a
little
attached
to
the
theorist
he
talked
loudly
but
so
far
as
i
knew
his
hands
had
never
been
stained
with
any
actual
crime
further
he
was
most
sincere
resolute
and
had
moreover
once
saved
me
from
drowning
at
great
risk
to
himself
and
like
so
many
other
persons
of
strong
character
had
contracted
a
warm
affection
for
his
debtor
that
his
visits
to
me
were
always
welcome
i
can
not
indeed
say
many
rumours
of
revolutions
and
risings
were
in
the
air
and
some
terrible
anarchist
outrages
reported
from
berlin
had
made
the
authorities
unusually
wary
burnett
in
consequence
was
a
marked
man
and
his
friends
and
acquaintances
shone
with
a
borrowed
glory
moderate
as
were
my
own
views
they
might
conceivably
be
a
blind
and
this
possibility
had
of
late
been
officially
recognized
it
was
wonderful
what
a
visiting
list
i
had
and
still
more
wonderful
that
my
callers
so
often
chose
hours
when
i
was
out
however
as
they
found
that
i
was
guiltless
of
harbouring
explosives
and
had
no
correspondence
worth
noting
their
attentions
were
slowly
becoming
infrequent
burnett
too
had
been
holding
aloof
of
late
indeed
i
had
not
been
treated
to
his
propaganda
for
some
weeks
to
what
was
the
honour
of
this
unexpected
visit
due
off
to
paris
i
hear
he
continued
well
i
thought
i
might
do
worse
than
look
in
i
have
something
to
tell
you
illustration
a
visit
from
burnett
my
dear
fellow
i
cried
you
choose
your
time
oddly
i
must
leave
this
place
in
a
trice
meanwhile
however
tell
me
where
you
ve
been
of
late
and
what
this
latest
wrinkle
i
well
out
of
london
if
you
had
not
been
rushing
off
at
short
notice
i
might
have
spoken
more
to
the
point
you
can
t
stay
a
couple
of
days
longer
can
you
say
yes
and
i
will
engage
to
open
your
eyes
a
no
i
fear
i
can
t
the
congress
is
not
till
the
but
meantime
i
want
rest
i
am
positively
done
up
time
enough
however
later
burnett
laughed
it
is
worth
while
sometimes
to
take
time
by
the
forelock
look
here
i
am
bound
hand
and
foot
at
present
but
this
i
will
say
your
congresses
and
your
revolutionary
or
what
played
i
think
i
have
heard
that
remark
before
i
somewhat
coldly
rejoined
still
say
what
you
like
you
will
find
that
we
hold
the
reins
i
won
t
say
anything
more
of
the
practicability
of
anarchism
we
have
talked
the
matter
over
but
this
i
will
say
compared
with
us
you
are
a
handful
of
people
politically
speaking
of
no
account
and
perhaps
on
the
whole
best
left
to
the
attention
of
the
police
forgive
my
bluntness
but
to
my
mind
your
crusade
when
not
absurd
appears
only
as
you
like
said
burnett
doggedly
the
world
has
had
enough
time
for
biting
has
come
restrain
your
eloquence
for
a
season
and
i
ll
promise
you
a
wonderful
change
of
what
have
your
continental
friends
more
wrecking
in
hand
what
idiocy
is
this
wretched
campaign
it
converts
no
one
strengthens
the
hands
of
the
reactionaries
and
what
is
more
destroys
useful
capital
why
i
say
injure
society
thus
aimlessly
curse
society
a
heavy
fist
struck
my
i
detest
both
society
as
it
is
and
society
as
you
hope
it
will
be
the
capitalist
wolves
and
a
slavish
multitude
a
corrupt
officialism
and
the
same
slavish
multitude
only
with
new
masters
but
about
our
numbers
my
friend
you
think
that
we
must
be
politically
impotent
because
we
are
relatively
so
few
we
count
only
our
thousands
where
you
tot
up
your
millions
of
supporters
obviously
we
could
hardly
venture
to
beard
you
after
the
established
orthodox
fashion
but
suppose
suppose
i
say
our
people
had
some
incalculable
force
behind
them
suppose
for
instance
that
the
leaders
of
these
few
thousands
came
to
possess
some
novel
made
them
virtual
dictators
to
their
kind
looking
very
hard
at
me
he
seemed
to
await
my
answer
with
interest
suppositions
of
this
sort
are
best
kept
for
novels
besides
i
see
no
scope
even
for
such
an
is
part
of
the
furniture
of
utopia
but
stay
was
not
this
invention
the
dream
of
that
saintly
dynamiter
hartmann
also
hartmann
now
there
s
a
typical
case
of
genius
wasted
on
anarchy
a
pretty
story
is
that
of
your
last
to
blow
up
a
prince
and
destroys
an
arch
and
an
applewoman
for
the
life
of
me
i
can
t
see
light
here
all
men
bungle
sometimes
growled
the
revolutionist
ignoring
the
first
part
of
my
reply
hartmann
with
the
years
ago
was
it
ah
he
was
young
then
but
mark
me
my
friend
don
t
call
people
martyrs
prematurely
you
think
hartmann
went
down
with
that
me
to
express
a
well
i
responded
it
matters
little
to
me
anyhow
but
anarchy
apart
how
that
poor
old
mother
of
his
would
relish
a
glimpse
of
him
if
what
you
hint
at
is
true
he
nodded
and
involuntarily
my
thoughts
ran
back
to
the
days
of
when
my
uncle
read
me
then
a
mere
boy
the
account
of
hartmann
s
outrage
as
hartmann
s
first
crime
is
notorious
i
run
some
risk
of
purveying
stale
news
but
for
a
younger
generation
it
will
suffice
to
mention
the
attempt
of
this
enthusiast
to
blow
up
the
german
crown
prince
and
suite
when
driving
over
westminster
bridge
on
the
occasion
of
their
visit
revenge
for
the
severe
measures
taken
against
berlin
anarchists
was
the
motive
but
by
some
mischance
the
mine
exploded
just
after
the
carriages
had
passed
wreaking
however
terrible
havoc
in
the
process
my
sneer
about
the
applewoman
must
not
be
taken
too
seriously
for
though
it
is
quite
true
that
one
such
unfortunate
perished
yet
fifty
to
sixty
victims
fell
with
her
in
the
crash
of
a
rent
arch
there
was
a
terrible
burst
of
indignation
from
all
parts
of
the
civilized
world
and
the
usual
medley
of
useless
arrests
the
real
culprits
hartmann
and
his
shadow

and
failing
further
news
it
was
believed
that
all
on
board
had
gone
down
with
her
hartmann
was
known
to
have
possessed
large
funds
and
these
also
presumably
lined
the
such
was
the
official
belief
and
most
people
had
agreed
that
the
official
belief
was
the
right
one
i
should
add
that
among
hartmann
s
victims
must
in
a
sense
be
classed
his
mother
at
the
time
of
which
i
am
now
writing
she
was
leading
a
very
retired
but
useful
life
in
islington
where
she
spent
her
days
in
and
other
charitable
work
she
still
wore
deep
mourning
and
had
never
so
it
seemed
got
over
the
shock
caused
by
the
appalling
crime
and
early
death
of
her
son
burnett
knew
her
very
well
indeed
though
she
scarcely
appreciated
his
visits
i
was
myself
on
excellent
terms
with
the
old
lady
but
had
not
seen
her
for
some
weeks
previous
to
the
conversation
here
recorded
my
time
running
fine
burnett
shortly
rose
to
go
be
sure
he
said
and
look
me
up
early
on
your
return
mischief
i
tell
you
is
brewing
and
how
soon
i
shall
have
to
pitch
my
camp
elsewhere
i
hardly
he
was
moving
to
the
door
when
my
landlady
entered
with
a
note
she
had
probably
been
listening
to
the
conversation
for
she
glanced
rather
timorously
at
my
guest
before
depositing
her
charge
wait
one
moment
burnett
and
i
ll
see
you
out
said
i
as
i
hastily
broke
the
envelope
yes
there
was
no
mistaking
the
hand
the
missive
was
really
from
my
old
friend
northerton
its
contents
were
fated
to
upset
my
programme
only
two
days
back
i
had
arranged
to
meet
the
family
in
paris
at
the
express
invitation
of
her
husband
a
genial
old
liberal
who
took
a
lively
interest
in
my
work
this
arrangement
now
received
its
carshalton
terrace
dear
stanley
we
have
just
returned
from
paris
where
we
had
as
you
know
intended
to
stay
some
time
old
matthews
whom
you
will
recollect
died
about
a
fortnight
ago
leaving
the
colonel
one
of
his
executors
as
the
estate
is
in
rather
a
muddled
condition
a
good
deal
of
attention
may
be
necessary
so
we
made
up
our
minds
to
forego
the
rest
of
our
trip
for
the
present
i
shall
be
at
home
afternoon
when
we
shall
be
delighted
to
see
you
with
best
wishes
from
all
always
yours
sincerely
maude
northerton
comes
in
for
a
bequest
of
in
matthews
s
lena
in
london
this
was
quite
decisive
excuse
me
burnett
i
said
turning
to
my
neglected
friend
but
this
letter
is
most
important
a
nice
business
pickle
i
am
in
i
can
tell
what
your
business
correspondents
use
you
have
my
deep
sympathies
well
farewell
for
the
don
t
be
in
a
hurry
i
said
i
am
afraid
i
must
postpone
this
continental
trip
after
all
business
is
business
whoever
one
s
informant
may
be
no
i
must
really
knock
a
few
days
off
my
burnett
stared
and
concluded
that
something
really
serious
was
on
hand
so
you
will
be
available
for
two
or
three
days
longer
that
being
so
i
shall
expect
to
see
you
at
the
old
place
about
eight
o
clock
evening
be
sure
and
come
for
i
have
a
guest
with
me
of
peculiar
interest
to
both
of
us
his
name
oh
don
t
be
impatient
it
is
a
fixture
then
all
right
no
i
can
t
stay
i
laughed
heartily
after
i
had
seen
him
out
what
a
chequered
life
what
curious
connections
were
a
jostle
with
fashion
now
with
fanatics
of
anarchy
like
burnett
travelling
it
is
said
planes
away
social
prejudices
and
certainly
in
combination
with
karl
marx
it
had
done
so
in
my
case
many
friends
used
to
rally
me
about
my
liking
for
the
haunts
of
luxury
and
some
even
went
so
far
as
to
say
it
was
of
a
piece
with
my
other
lukewarm
doctrines
the
answer
however
was
ready
i
hated
revolution
and
i
equally
hated
the
pettiness
of
a
sordid
socialism
we
must
not
i
contended
see
the
graces
of
high
life
art
and
culture
fouled
by
the
mob
but
the
mob
elevated
into
a
possession
and
appreciation
of
the
graces
it
was
just
because
i
believed
some
approach
to
this
ideal
to
be
possible
that
i
fought
under
the
banners
of
my
party
and
forewent
travel
and
independence
in
the
interests
of
the
that
i
was
no
orator
puff
i
yearned
for
some
opportunity
to
show
cavillers
would
have
then
found
that
my
money
my
repute
and
if
needful
my
life
were
all
alike
subservient
to
the
cause
i
had
at
heart
that
night
however
lighter
visions
were
to
beguile
my
thoughts
when
i
dwelt
upon
once
more
meeting
miss
northerton
even
burnett
s
sombre
hints
lost
their
power
to
interest
me
and
when
later
on
i
did
find
time
to
sift
them
they
received
short
shrift
at
my
hands
bluster
in
large
part
no
doubt
was
my
verdict
as
i
turned
into
bed
that
night
however
i
should
be
in
a
better
position
to
judge
the
interview
would
at
any
rate
prove
interesting
for
burnett
s
anarchist
friends
however
desperate
would
furnish
material
in
plenty
for
a
study
of
human
nature
chapter
ii
the
shadow
of
hartmann
it
was
with
a
light
heart
that
i
made
my
way
to
the
northertons
the
following
afternoon
the
prospect
of
a
chat
with
the
smart
old
gentleman
and
his
ladies
was
delightful
and
my
only
apprehensions
concerned
the
assemblage
i
possibly
might
find
there
as
a
rule
receptions
of
this
sort
are
tedious
prolific
only
of
dyspepsia
and
boring
conversations
upper
mediocrity
swarms
round
mammon
and
mammon
the
cult
of
the
senses
apart
is
uninteresting
with
mill
i
was
always
of
opinion
that
the
thinker
is
corrupted
by
the
pettinesses
of
ordinary
social
intercourse
true
one
occasionally
meets
a
celebrity
but
celebrities
who
are
not
professional
talkers
are
best
left
repute
usually
so
outshines
their
deportment
and
conversation
still
the
celebrity
is
tolerable
provided
that
not
too
much
incense
is
required
the
same
thing
can
not
be
said
of
the
of
mediocrities
of
contact
with
this
the
effects
may
be
as
serious
as
they
will
certainly
prove
painful
to
a
of
the
human
species
happily
i
rarely
suffered
at
the
northertons
ever
and
anon
lions
stalked
through
their
premises
and
the
legions
of
imbeciles
thronged
them
but
there
was
generally
the
host
or
hostess
to
fall
back
upon
to
say
nothing
of
the
companionship
of
lena
to
whom
if
the
secret
must
be
revealed
i
had
for
some
time
been
engaged
the
understanding
was
for
the
present
to
be
privy
to
ourselves
but
i
had
no
reason
to
suppose
that
her
worthy
parents
would
have
cause
to
object
to
the
match
my
politics
which
might
have
scared
most
people
of
their
standing
merely
interested
the
and
were
wholly
indifferent
to
his
wife
but
still
it
was
satisfactory
to
think
that
lena
would
shortly
come
of
age
and
that
our
joint
means
would
be
sufficient
to
enable
us
to
ignore
any
probable
obstacles
old
matthews
s
legacy
had
removed
the
last
formidable
barrier
two
years
before
i
had
the
good
fortune
to
meet
the
family
on
that
memorable
occasion
when
i
was
so
hurriedly
summoned
from
egypt
the
promenade
deck
of
a
and
steamer
offers
boundless
facilities
for
forming
friendships
and
during
the
brief
interval
which
bridged
my
start
from
suez
and
arrival
at
london
i
was
not
slow
in
harvesting
these
advantages
to
the
full
old
northerton
was
returning
home
after
serving
his
time
in
the
indian
civil
service
and
with
him
were
his
wife
his
two
sons
and
an
only
daughter
my
singular
interest
in
the
family
hinged
mainly
on
the
latter
a
charming
young
girl
of
some
eighteen
summers
what
that
interest
culminated
in
i
have
already
said
it
only
remains
to
add
that
the
cordial
relations
set
up
between
the
family
and
myself
were
never
allowed
to
drop
the
two
sons
were
now
serving
on
the
indian
staff
corps
but
i
corresponded
with
them
ever
and
anon
and
even
reckoned
the
younger
among
my
numerous
socialist
proselytes
old
northerton
was
well
aware
of
this
and
though
himself
a
liberal
of
the
old
school
had
no
reproach
for
the
teacher
after
all
a
sub
reading
karl
marx
under
the
punkahs
of
was
scarcely
a
formidable
convert
a
short
walk
carried
me
to
the
terrace
and
ere
long
i
was
being
warmly
greeted
by
the
only
three
available
members
of
the
family
northerton
was
too
busy
with
her
guests
to
pay
me
much
attention
so
after
a
few
explanations
and
regrets
for
the
spoilt
trip
i
was
borne
off
in
charge
of
the
genial
commissioner
well
how
go
your
election
prospects
he
said
as
cheerily
as
if
my
programme
favoured
his
class
not
as
well
as
i
could
wish
they
say
i
am
too
moderate
for
the
constituency
you
know
of
course
that
lawler
a
blood
and
thunder
is
standing
against
me
in
the
interests
of
the
extreme
so
i
hear
but
i
should
scarcely
have
thought
he
would
have
stood
a
on
the
contrary
i
assure
you
he
speaks
for
a
numerous
and
very
ugly
party
which
arrears
of
legislation
have
done
as
much
as
anything
to
create
talking
of
this
i
am
not
at
all
sure
that
we
may
not
have
trouble
before
long
i
shall
do
my
best
to
have
the
peace
kept
but
there
s
no
knowing
to
what
the
more
reckless
agitators
may
drive
the
there
i
agree
with
you
sir
broke
in
an
old
gentleman
with
spectacles
but
how
do
you
reconcile
that
opinion
with
your
own
doctrines
how
can
you
speak
and
write
for
socialism
when
you
grumble
at
its
practical
enforcement
you
state
that
you
oppose
revolution
but
is
a
constitutional
settlement
of
the
problem
possible
why
not
you
must
remember
that
a
large
section
of
us
socialists
is
against
revolution
looking
back
at
the
graduated
nature
of
the
transition
between
feudalism
and
modern
capitalism
these
men
would
meditate
if
possible
a
similar
though
perhaps
more
rapid
transition
between
modern
capitalism
and
socialism
any
sudden
metamorphosis
of
society
would
they
believe
breed
appalling
evils
i
am
quite
of
this
way
of
thinking
my
interlocutor
laughed
he
evidently
thought
me
a
reasonable
enough
creature
for
my
kind
the
commissioner
remarked
that
it
was
a
pity
that
all
the
party
were
not
of
my
way
of
thinking
but
i
added
i
have
no
hesitation
in
saying
that
if
i
thought
a
revolution
would
pay
for
revolution
i
would
declare
myself
it
is
only
a
question
of
cost
complicated
by
dangers
of
reaction
and
anarchy
the
consideration
which
weighs
most
with
me
is
the
difficulty
of
organizing
and
legislating
at
a
time
when
panic
and
brutality
would
be
rampant
i
know
no
men
competent
to
stand
at
the
helm
in
such
tempests
even
with
civil
peace
to
help
us
a
settlement
would
require
to
my
thinking
years
of
patient
labour
mere
revolutionary
conventions
with
some
constitution
and
panaceas
for
suffering
would
be
impotent
echoed
the
old
gentleman
by
the
way
you
have
not
answered
my
the
object
sir
of
my
agitation
is
to
force
the
projected
reforms
on
public
attention
and
so
to
secure
that
most
important
of
allies
an
effective
but
let
me
add
that
once
elected
to
parliament
i
am
prepared
to
stand
by
any
government
tory
or
radical
in
supporting
the
cause
of
order
we
contend
that
should
the
revolutionary
socialists
or
the
anarchists
initiate
a
crusade
in
the
streets
they
must
take
the
consequences
of
their
well
said
observed
the
i
notice
in
this
regard
that
some
very
disquieting
rumours
are
afloat
not
only
are
many
of
the
east
and
south
london
workers
becoming
dangerous
but
these
miscreants
the
anarchists
are
moving
you
remember
the
fiendish
massacre
ten
years
back
when
hartmann
blew
up
the
bridge
well
the
police
have
had
information
that
this
wretch
is
not
dead
after
all
at
the
present
moment
he
is
believed
to
be
in
england
stirring
up
more
the
deuce
he
is
cried
the
old
gentleman
i
hope
they
will
run
him
to
at
this
point
our
colloquy
was
broken
off
by
lena
who
sailed
gracefully
through
the
crowd
i
want
you
for
a
moment
stanley
a
friend
of
mine
gryffyn
is
very
anxious
to
make
your
acquaintance
she
s
mad
about
land
law
reform
and
women
s
the
old
gentleman
grinned
and
northerton
eyed
me
pityingly
there
was
no
escape
from
the
inquisitor
why
on
earth
couldn
t
you
spare
me
this
lena
i
whispered
i
want
a
talk
with
you
all
alone
not
an
hour
with
this
oh
it
s
all
right
i
shall
keep
you
company
and
as
she
is
going
soon
we
shall
be
able
to
get
into
a
quiet
nook
and
have
a
long
the
ordeal
over
i
had
the
luxury
of
a
with
my
and
excellent
use
i
made
of
the
limited
time
at
my
disposal
i
was
very
fond
of
lena
who
was
not
only
a
charmingly
pretty
girl
but
thank
goodness
sympathized
most
cordially
with
the
bulk
of
my
political
opinions
she
never
of
course
mixed
with
the
peculiar
circles
i
frequented
but
dearly
loved
to
follow
my
reports
of
the
movements
which
they
represented
the
only
person
remotely
connected
with
them
she
knew
was
hartmann
to
whose
house
i
had
brought
her
in
the
hope
that
the
old
lady
might
find
a
friend
lena
was
often
to
be
seen
in
the
little
parlour
at
islington
and
knew
probably
more
about
the
poor
widow
s
troubles
than
any
one
else
as
her
parents
gave
her
complete
freedom
of
action
she
had
plenty
of
opportunities
for
cultivating
the
acquaintance
after
our
private
confidences
had
been
duly
exchanged
the
conversation
naturally
drifted
to
this
topic
i
was
anxious
to
know
about
the
old
lady
s
welfare
and
casually
mentioned
the
rumour
which
concerned
her
son
had
it
reached
her
ears
illustration
lena
wants
me
i
am
sure
i
don
t
know
said
lena
she
seemed
in
marvellously
good
spirits
when
i
saw
her
last
but
she
made
no
allusion
whatever
to
the
subject
how
could
she
when
you
come
to
think
of
it
it
is
all
very
well
rejoicing
over
a
prodigal
son
s
return
but
this
son
was
a
fiend
and
would
be
much
better
lying
quiet
at
the
bottom
of
the
sea
where
people
imagined
but
you
forget
dear
that
he
was
her
only
son
and
always
good
to
that
s
true
but
look
at
the
blood
on
his
hands
by
the
bye
hartmann
once
told
me
the
whole
story
hartmann
you
know
was
educated
for
the
profession
of
an
engineer
and
was
always
looked
on
as
a
prodigy
of
intellectual
vigour
whatever
he
did
he
did
well
and
as
he
came
into
a
considerable
fortune
when
of
age
a
brilliant
career
was
predicted
for
him
hartmann
says
that
at
that
time
she
never
knew
he
had
any
other
interests
than
those
of
his
calling
but
it
appears
from
later
discoveries
that
when
years
of
age
he
made
the
acquaintance
of
a
german
exile
one
schwartz
a
miscreant
of
notorious
opinions
and
character
this
man
gradually
inspired
him
with
a
hatred
of
the
whole
fabric
of
society
and
the
end
of
it
was
that
he
became
an
anarchist
that
hartmann
was
deeply
in
earnest
seems
perfectly
clear
he
sacrificed
to
his
aim
position
comfort
reputation
his
short
everything
he
regarded
civilization
as
rotten
from
top
to
foundation
and
the
present
human
race
as
only
fit
for
schwartz
was
a
pessimist
and
his
pupil
became
one
of
an
even
deeper
but
what
was
his
ultimate
aim
he
thought
like
some
writers
that
man
must
revert
to
simpler
conditions
of
life
and
make
a
new
start
he
hoped
so
his
mother
says
that
his
example
would
fire
the
minds
of
others
and
so
topple
over
the
very
pedestals
of
governments
and
law
it
was
absurd
he
held
for
a
few
men
to
war
against
society
but
he
added
the
affection
he
laboured
under
was
catching
he
trusted
that
one
day
london
and
the
great
cities
of
europe
would
lie
in
but
i
interposed
this
is
fanaticism
or
rather
madness
it
is
a
bred
by
an
effete
form
of
civilization
is
this
all
the
wily
anarchist
plotted
for
well
it
s
a
pretty
large
all
is
it
not
by
the
way
he
had
one
persistent
craze
the
belief
in
some
invention
which
was
one
day
to
place
society
at
his
so
awkward
that
for
we
talked
for
some
time
longer
when
i
called
my
appointment
to
mind
and
tearing
myself
away
from
my
kind
friends
sallied
forth
into
the
street
it
was
not
easy
to
refuse
the
s
invitation
to
dinner
in
view
of
burnett
s
dismal
parlour
at
stepney
still
i
was
not
a
little
interested
in
his
guest
and
anxious
so
far
as
was
possible
to
keep
burnett
himself
out
of
mischief
hitherto
he
had
been
a
mere
theorist
with
a
very
kindly
side
and
there
seemed
no
reason
why
with
care
he
should
not
remain
one
but
he
required
so
i
thought
watching
with
these
thoughts
uppermost
in
my
mind
i
hailed
a
hansom
and
ordered
the
driver
to
drop
me
in
the
east
end
in
a
road
running
hard
by
the
anarchist
s
house
i
can
recall
my
entrance
into
that
parlour
most
vividly
burnett
had
let
me
in
with
his
usual
caution
whisking
off
my
coat
i
followed
him
to
the
parlour
there
was
a
bright
fire
burning
in
the
grate
and
the
gleam
of
the
only
light
in
the
up
a
and
some
glasses
on
the
table
and
ever
and
anon
revealed
the
rude
prints
on
the
walls
and
the
rough
deal
shelves
heaped
with
books
everything
smelt
of
the
practical
in
the
place
of
the
louis
xiv
furniture
of
the
northertons
only
a
wooden
table
and
some
three
or
four
deal
chairs
met
the
eye
the
sole
article
rejoicing
in
a
cushion
being
a
sofa
in
the
corner
the
single
window
i
noticed
was
carefully
curtained
and
barred
stepping
toward
the
mantelpiece
burnett
struck
a
match
and
proceeded
to
light
a
couple
of
candles
which
crowned
that
dusty
eminence
i
then
saw
to
my
surprise
that
we
were
not
alone
on
a
chair
by
the
corner
of
the
fire
sat
an
elderly
man
apparently
of
the
higher
artisan
class
his
face
was
most
unprepossessing
there
was
a
s
obstinacy
and
attachment
about
it
but
the
eyes
were
unspeakably
wicked
and
the
mouth
hard
and
cruel
i
diagnosed
it
at
once
as
that
of
a
man
whose
past
was
best
unread
whose
hand
had
in
dark
been
persistently
raised
against
his
fellowmen
it
takes
time
to
analyze
this
impression
but
originally
it
seized
me
in
a
moment
i
was
prejudiced
accordingly
at
the
outset
but
judge
of
my
astonishment
and
disgust
when
burnett
cried
here
schwartz
is
my
old
pal
it
was
the
shameless
miscreant
known
as
the
shadow
of
hartmann
coldly
enough
i
took
the
proffered
hand
so
this
was
the
fanatic
supposed
to
be
long
ago
dead
one
felt
like
abetting
a
murderer
stanley
seems
startled
laughed
burnett
he
is
not
much
accustomed
to
high
life
come
man
acknowledge
you
had
a
the
meeting
was
half
of
my
seeking
and
decency
after
all
forbade
openly
expressed
dislike
besides
schwartz
was
in
practice
only
what
burnett
was
in
theory
and
what
possibly
even
i
and
other
moderates
might
become
at
a
pinch
i
confess
i
replied
i
was
taken
somewhat
aback
it
is
seldom
the
sea
gives
up
its
dead
and
one
does
not
meet
celebrities
like
herr
schwartz
every
schwartz
laughed
grimly
i
could
see
he
was
pleasantly
tickled
monstrous
conceits
sprout
from
the
shedding
of
blood
he
seemed
to
chuckle
that
he
outcast
and
rebel
had
hurled
so
many
of
his
fellows
into
nothingness
if
this
was
the
man
what
of
the
master
fill
up
your
glass
stanley
and
burnett
pushed
the
whisky
across
the
table
sit
down
and
ask
what
questions
you
schwartz
looked
me
carefully
over
you
say
again
that
you
answer
for
this
friend
he
muttered
to
burnett
as
i
would
for
it
is
hartmann
is
alive
then
i
ventured
after
all
very
much
so
put
in
burnett
the
most
he
got
was
a
wetting
he
and
schwartz
were
picked
up
by
a
and
carried
to
dieppe
hence
they
made
their
way
to
switzerland
where
they
have
been
for
some
years
hartmann
had
money
schwartz
devotion
money
bred
grew
rich
and
they
will
yet
lead
anarchy
to
triumph
for
at
last
after
long
years
of
danger
delay
and
disappointment
the
dream
of
hartmann
is
realized
my
companions
exchanged
meaning
glances
evidently
they
were
in
high
spirits
and
the
deputy
the
socialist
will
he
join
us
cried
schwartz
he
will
have
no
struggles
no
dangers
he
will
tread
capital
underfoot
he
will
raise
his
hand
and
fortresses
will
rattle
around
both
the
anarchists
broke
into
renewed
laughter
i
was
tired
of
hyperbole
and
wished
to
get
at
the
facts
but
do
what
i
would
my
men
refused
to
be
for
a
long
time
i
could
only
glean
from
them
that
hartmann
was
in
london
and
plotting
mischief
on
some
hitherto
unimagined
scale
at
last
i
grew
irritated
at
the
splutter
nonsense
herr
schwartz
nonsense
stir
a
step
worth
the
noting
and
the
very
workers
will
rise
and
crush
you
i
tell
you
your
notions
are
fantastic
your
campaign
against
society
maniacal
how
can
a
few
scattered
incendiaries
or
dynamiters
ceaselessly
dodging
the
law
hope
to
defy
a
state
the
thing
is
ridiculous
as
well
match
a
against
a
woolwich
my
friend
speaks
of
a
struggle
such
as
one
man
might
wage
against
a
mob
in
the
street
it
is
not
for
this
that
hartmann
has
plotted
so
long
it
is
not
to
be
shot
by
soldiers
or
hunted
by
police
that
he
will
once
more
shake
this
city
do
you
wish
to
guess
his
weapon
take
this
piece
of
stuff
in
your
hand
and
tell
me
what
you
think
of
as
he
spoke
he
rummaged
his
pockets
and
produced
a
small
plate
apparently
of
silvery
grey
metal
of
about
two
square
inches
of
surface
and
of
an
inch
or
so
in
thickness
i
examined
it
carefully
now
take
this
steel
knife
and
hammer
and
test
its
hardness
and
i
did
so
burnett
looked
on
knowingly
well
it
is
extremely
tough
and
hard
for
i
can
make
no
impression
what
it
is
however
i
can
t
but
its
weight
its
weight
said
burnett
i
must
have
changed
colour
why
it
is
as
light
or
lighter
than
cardboard
what
an
extraordinary
combination
of
attributes
extraordinary
indeed
it
is
the
grandest
of
hartmann
s
strokes
but
you
can
not
guess
its
use
i
shook
my
head
well
suppose
you
try
to
think
it
out
between
now
and
saturday
night
when
i
will
promise
to
introduce
you
to
the
inventor
what
hartmann
yes
let
us
see
you
address
a
meeting
down
at
turner
s
hall
in
this
quarter
on
saturday
i
will
be
in
the
audience
and
we
will
beard
the
captain
in
company

kensington
gardens
by
the
pond
to
the
left
as
you
enter
from
the
queen
s
is
the
come
are
you
ready
i
think
i
may
tell
you
that
you
will
run
no
risks
while
at
any
rate
you
will
see
something
strange
beyond
illustration
you
can
not
guess
its
use
i
hesitated
the
mystery
was
deepening
and
to
confront
and
have
it
out
with
the
celebrated
if
hateful
anarchist
would
be
interesting
and
these
queer
hints
too
yes
i
m
your
man
but
we
must
have
no
obvious
burnett
nodded
shortly
afterwards
the
obnoxious
german
took
his
departure
and
left
us
to
ourselves
i
am
not
sure
that
he
quite
trusted
my
intentions
for
the
dread
of
the
police
spy
was
ever
present
with
him
we
two
talked
on
till
midnight
on
rising
to
go
i
made
a
final
effort
to
squeeze
the
anarchist
come
john
it
s
no
use
playing
the
mystery
man
any
longer
i
shall
know
everything
by
saturday
night
or
rather
sunday
morning
you
trust
me
with
your
other
secrets
trust
me
with
this
at
any
rate
a
three
days
interval
can
t
make
much
burnett
thought
a
moment
stepped
to
his
shelves
and
took
down
a
work
of
somewhat
antique
binding
it
was
from
the
pen
of
a
savant
of
high
repute
in
his
day
slowly
and
without
comment
he
read
me
the
following
passage
yet
there
is
a
real
impediment
in
the
way
of
man
navigating
the
air
and
that
is
the
excessive
weight
of
the
only
great
mechanical
moving
powers
hitherto
placed
at
his
disposal
when
science
shall
have
discovered
some
moving
power
greatly
lighter
than
any
we
yet
know
in
all
probability
the
problem
will
be

a

a
raw
london
morning
is
a
terrible
foe
to
that
have
danced
before
the
view
on
the
foregoing
night
tend
to
lose
their
charm
or
even
to
merge
themselves
wholly
in
the
commonplace
so
it
was
with
me
when
i
came
down
to
breakfast
and
reviewed
the
situation
calmly
i
was
ready
to
laugh
at
my
faith
in
what
seemed
the
wild
vagaries
of
schwartz
and
burnett
the
memory
of
the
queer
little
parlour
and
its
queerer
tenants
had
lost
its
vividness
and
given
place
to
a
suspicion
that
either
i
or
my
hosts
had
indulged
too
freely
in
whisky
the
little
plate
however
was
still
in
my
possession
and
this
very
tangible
witness
sufficed
despite
a
growing
scepticism
to
give
me
pause
a
striking
discovery
no
doubt
was
my
verdict
but
the
dream
of
hartmann
as
burnett
calls
it
is
not
so
easily
still
i
should
know
anything
worth
the
mention
was
to
be
saturday
night
if
i
showed
up
at
the
odd
named
by
which
at
that
hour
meant
a
scramble
over
palings
and
a
possible
trouble
with
the
police
but
these
things
were
trifles
all
things
considered
i
should
do
well
to
present
myself
with
or
without
burnett
for
the
boasted
aëronef
apart
the
threats
of
the
anarchists
had
begun
to
perplex
me
mightily
and
the
wish
to
meet
their
notorious
leader
the
so
terrible
son
of
my
old
friend
hartmann
was
not
to
be
summarily
exorcised
i
had
passed
the
morning
in
study
luncheon
over
i
jotted
down
some
notes
for
my
speech
on
the
following
saturday
next
i
sent
lena
a
note
promising
to
look
in
on
sunday
afternoon
sallied
out
with
it
to
the
post
and
then
ensconced
myself
in
an
omnibus
which
was
plying
in
the
direction
of
islington
whither
was
i
bound
for
the
house
of
my
friend
hartmann
whom
as
already
mentioned
i
had
not
seen
for
some
time
and
whose
conversation
just
now
might
be
fraught
with
peculiar
interest
had
the
son
as
yet
seen
the
mother
had
any
inkling
of
these
vaguely
discussed
new
plots
reached
her
had
she
any
clue
to
the
mystery
tapped
questions
such
as
these
surged
up
in
dozens
and
i
determined
if
possible
to
feel
my
way
to
their
answers
it
was
late
in
the
afternoon
when
i
reached
hartmann
s
modest
villa
in
islington
the
maid
who
admitted
me
said
that
she
was
not
at
home
having
gone
to
visit
a
sick
child
in
the
neighbourhood
she
expected
her
back
to
tea
and
meanwhile
perhaps
i
would
like
to
wait
there
was
clearly
no
resource
open
to
me
but
to
do
so
and
entering
the
narrow
hall
i
was
shown
into
a
simply
but
withal
not
uncomfortably
furnished
the
bay
window
which
lighted
the
apartment
looked
on
to
a
neat
diversified
by
some
small
but
parterres
there
was
little
within
to
catch
the
eye
exploring
the
walls
i
came
across
a
shelf
full
of
musty
books
mathematical
and
engineering
and
a
variety
of
treatises
on
political
economy
and
the
sciences
evidently
mementos
of
the
son
while
glancing
through
some
and
noting
the
numerous
traces
of
careful
study
the
thought
struck
me
that
the
photograph
of
their
misguided
possessor
might
also
be
accessible
i
had
been
many
times
in
the
room
before
but
had
never
been
favoured
with
the
old
lady
s
confidences
on
the
score
of
her
son
the
wound
caused
by
his
crime
was
ever
green
and
i
at
least
was
not
cruel
enough
to
disturb
it
however
being
now
left
alone
i
resolved
to
consult
her
albums
which
at
any
rate
might
serve
to
while
away
the
hour
loosening
the
clasp
of
one
that
lay
near
to
hand
i
turned
over
its
leaves
rapidly
as
a
rule
i
dislike
collections
of
this
sort
there
is
a
prosiness
peculiar
to
albums
which
forbids
incautious
research
but
here
the
hunt
was
of
interest
true
there
were
mediocre
denizens
in
plenty
shoals
of
cousins
sisters
and
aunts
hordes
of
nonentities
whom
burnett
would
have
dubbed
only
fit
for
fuel
but
there
was
discoverable
one
very
satisfactory
loose
photograph
marked
on
the
back
r
hartmann
taken
when
years
of
age
just
about
the
time
of
the
celebrated
bridge
incident
it
was
the
face
of
a
young
man
evidently
of
high
capacity
and
unflinching
resolution
a
slight
moustache
brushed
the
upper
lip
and
set
off
a
but
somewhat
cruel
mouth
a
more
completely
independent
expression
i
never
saw
the
lineaments
obscured
by
time
defied
accurate
survey
but
the
general
effect
produced
was
that
they
indicated
an
arbitrary
and
domineering
soul
utterly
impatient
of
control
and
loftily
contemptuous
of
its
kind
i
was
carefully
conning
the
face
when
i
heard
the
creak
on
its
hinges
a
sound
followed
by
the
rattle
of
a
in
the
lock
of
the
front
door
hartmann
had
returned
passing
into
the
room
she
met
me
with
a
pleasant
smile
which
showed
up
in
curious
contrast
to
the
look
of
depression
so
familiar
to
me
of
yore
i
interpreted
that
brightness
in
an
instant
hartmann
had
returned
and
had
paid
her
the
visit
of
one
raised
from
the
dead
but
of
his
terrible
designs
of
his
restless
hatred
of
society
he
had
clearly
told
her
nothing
hers
was
an
expressive
face
and
the
shadows
upon
it
were
few
enough
to
warrant
that
inference
probably
he
had
smoothed
over
the
past
and
fooled
her
with
some
talk
of
a
reformed
life
and
a
changed
creed
it
is
so
easy
for
an
only
son
to
persuade
a
when
he
rises
after
long
years
from
a
supposed
grave
well
stanley
you
are
the
last
person
i
expected
to
see
i
heard
you
were
to
be
in
paris
so
my
dear
hartmann
i
was
but
the
northertons
you
see
have
returned
and
i
had
hoped
to
have
done
some
touring
with
the
old
or
perhaps
with
miss
lena
no
don
t
look
so
innocent
for
she
tells
me
more
than
you
think
but
what
of
this
return
i
had
a
note
from
her
when
she
was
in
paris
but
she
said
nothing
about
it
some
will
business
i
explained
you
will
be
glad
to
hear
she
comes
in
for
by
a
nice
little
to
begin
upon
i
think
stanley
you
two
young
people
ought
to
do
very
i
hope
so
i
said
foregoing
useless
a
chatterbox
lena
could
be
at
any
rate
i
see
no
very
dangerous
rocks
ahead
at
illustration
the
photograph
the
conversation
wandered
for
some
time
among
various
topics
when
i
mentioned
that
i
had
been
looking
over
the
album
and
very
stupid
work
you
must
have
found
it
she
said
oh
it
kept
me
busy
while
waiting
by
the
way
one
of
the
photographs
is
loose
and
i
handed
her
that
of
her
son
this
time
with
the
face
upwards
the
ruse
was
effective
and
the
conversation
took
the
desired
course
have
you
never
seen
that
face
before
it
is
that
of
rudolf
my
misguided
son
of
whom
you
must
have
heard
poor
boy
ten
years
have
rolled
by
since
his
admirably
cool
this
mother
she
at
least
was
not
to
be
squeezed
offhand
but
my
chance
had
come
my
dear
hartmann
he
is
alive
and
you
know
it
two
days
ago
he
was
in
this
very
i
had
drawn
my
bow
at
a
venture
but
the
shaft
served
me
well
the
was
decisive
the
old
lady
s
face
betrayed
complete
discomfiture
mingled
with
obvious
signs
of
alarm
she
made
no
attempt
to
contradict
me
what
she
stammered
out
at
length
are
you
also
in
the
secret
are
you
too
one
no
i
replied
bluntly
anticipating
her
meaning
i
have
never
met
your
son
though
i
know
something
perhaps
of
his
movements
but
believe
me
you
may
trust
me
as
you
would
yourself
he
was
a
dynamitard
but
he
is
your
son
and
that
is
enough
for
me
rest
assured
of
my
her
distress
visibly
abated
thanks
many
thanks
i
feel
i
can
rely
on
to
lend
him
a
helping
hand
should
the
time
ever
come
ah
he
is
a
changed
man
an
entirely
changed
man
a
bright
future
may
await
him
even
now
across
the
sea
but
this
visit
to
sudden
so
fear
lest
it
may
cost
him
dear
you
a
private
man
have
found
it
out
why
may
not
the
police
also
it
is
terrible
this
suspense
how
can
i
be
sure
that
he
is
safe
at
this
moment
oh
as
to
that
happily
i
can
reassure
you
your
son
is
safe
as
safe
as
the
most
anxious
mother
could
desire
how
or
where
i
can
not
say
but
i
have
it
on
the
best
possible
authority
in
fact
only
last
night
i
heard
as
much
from
the
lips
of
one
who
should
surely
schwartz
himself
that
evil
genius
is
he
too
in
london
ah
if
he
is
content
all
is
well
no
tigress
ever
watched
better
over
her
cub
than
schwartz
over
my
son
would
his
likings
had
blown
elsewhere
that
man
was
my
son
s
tutor
in
vice
but
for
him
rudolf
might
have
been
an
honour
to
his
country
and
what
is
he
now
an
outlaw
in
the
shadow
of
the
gallows
she
hid
her
face
in
her
handkerchief
and
wept
bitterly
i
waited
patiently
till
the
tempest
was
over
putting
in
a
soothing
phrase
here
and
there
and
painting
black
white
with
the
zeal
of
a
skilful
casuist
one
need
not
be
too
scrupulous
when
sufferers
such
as
this
are
concerned
he
has
told
you
nothing
of
his
movements
i
remarked
cautiously
nothing
except
that
he
was
leaving
shortly
for
hamburg
whence
he
was
to
proceed
immediately
to
new
york
some
months
later
on
i
may
join
him
there
but
for
the
present
all
is
one
more
deception
of
hartmann
s
but
a
kindly
one
obviously
it
was
better
not
to
disturb
the
illusions
which
the
old
lady
thus
fondly
reformed
son
his
prospective
honourable
life
the
vision
of
a
lasting
reunion
abroad
were
she
to
suspect
that
mischief
was
again
being
plotted
by
the
anarchist
what
a
cruel
scattering
of
her
hopes
would
follow
i
assured
her
that
the
chances
were
all
in
her
son
s
favour
and
that
once
in
america
he
could
set
at
naught
all
possibilities
of
discovery
meanwhile
i
had
become
aware
that
nothing
of
importance
to
my
quest
was
to
be
drawn
from
hartmann
her
son
meteoric
visit
prompted
by
some
gleam
of
noble
sentiment
had
evidently
left
her
ignorant
of
his
new
inhuman
plottings
ere
long
i
rose
to
leave
not
however
without
having
promised
that
should
hartmann
ever
cross
my
path
i
would
stand
by
him
for
her
sake
in
a
possible
hour
of
danger
under
what
circumstances
i
was
to
meet
this
extraordinary
absurd
then
my
poor
promise
of
assistance
was
to
be
manifest
from
the
ensuing
narrative
chapter
iv
fugitives
from
the
law
on
saturday
evening
i
addressed
a
stormy
meeting
at
stepney
since
i
bade
adieu
to
hartmann
much
had
occurred
to
rouse
the
sleeping
tigers
in
the
country
riots
had
been
reported
from
many
great
towns
while
handbills
of
the
most
violent
sort
were
being
thrust
on
the
workers
of
london
revolutionary
counsels
had
been
long
scattered
by
a
thousand
demagogues
and
it
appeared
now
that
the
ingathering
of
the
harvest
was
nigh
a
renewal
of
anarchist
outrages
had
terrorized
the
and
fanned
the
extremists
into
vehemence
a
terrible
explosion
was
reported
from
kensington
three
houses
including
that
of
the
home
secretary
baynton
having
been
completely
wrecked
while
ten
of
their
inmates
had
been
killed
and
some
fourteen
more
or
less
severely
injured
a
disastrous
catastrophe
had
been
narrowly
averted
from
the
mansion
house
it
may
be
imagined
therefore
that
it
was
with
a
grave
face
that
i
ascended
the
platform
that
evening
my
course
being
rendered
so
difficult
by
reason
of
the
the
one
hand
by
the
conservatives
who
to
my
thinking
were
perpetuating
the
conditions
whence
anarchy
drew
its
breath
namely
a
wretched
proletariat
exploited
by
capital
on
the
other
by
the
extreme
socialists
who
despaired
of
effective
advance
by
way
of
ordinary
parliamentary
reforms
both
parties
were
strongly
represented
that
night
and
political
feeling
running
so
high
the
prospect
of
an
orderly
meeting
seemed
shadowy
i
had
some
unpleasant
truths
to
press
home
and
was
not
to
be
deterred
from
this
duty
before
rising
to
speak
i
glanced
anxiously
around
the
hall
and
imagine
my
feelings
when
i
found
that
burnett
was
missing
this
breach
of
his
engagement
was
ominous
that
he
had
a
hand
in
the
outrages
was
tone
had
of
late
been
most
threatening
and
the
influence
of
schwartz
was
the
supposition
was
one
i
did
not
like
to
entertain
at
any
rate
he
might
well
have
been
suspected
of
complicity
and
forced
to
seek
refuge
in
flight
it
was
with
a
heavy
heart
that
i
obeyed
the
behest
of
the
chairman
and
rose
to
address
the
meeting
what
i
said
matters
little
severe
condemnation
of
the
outrages
a
sharp
critique
of
the
groups
an
appeal
for
unity
and
order
in
our
agitation
were
the
points
upon
which
i
laid
emphasis
i
had
spoken
for
about
when
my
audience
refused
to
let
me
proceed
previously
to
this
interruptions
had
been
frequent
but
now
a
violent
uproar
arose
the
uproar
led
to
a
fight
and
a
rush
was
made
for
the
platform
which
albeit
gallantly
defended
was
speedily
enough
stormed
i
had
the
pleasure
of
knocking
over
one
ruffian
who
leapt
at
me
brandishing
a
chair
but
a
brutal
kick
from
behind
sent
me
spinning
into
the
crush
by
the
steps
severely
cuffed
and
pommelled
i
was
using
my
fists
freely
when
the
gas
was
suddenly
turned
off
and
the
struggle
being
summarily
damped
i
managed
somehow
to
get
into
the
street
and
now
came
the
exciting
business
of
the
night
in
the
mass
of
shouting
enthusiasts
outside
it
was
useless
to
look
for
burnett
i
determined
therefore
to
track
him
down
to
his
own
quarters
passing
back
into
the
i
hastily
scribbled
some
rather
indignant
lines
to
my
chairman
and
then
pulling
my
hat
over
my
eyes
elbowed
my
way
through
the
press
by
the
time
i
got
clear
of
the
street
i
was
considerably
flushed
and
heated
and
the
rate
at
which
i
was
going
by
no
means
conduced
to
refresh
me
after
ten
minutes
sharp
walk
i
plunged
down
the
narrow
street
where
burnett
s
house
lay
and
a
few
seconds
later
had
kicked
back
the
gate
and
marched
up
to
the
door
i
was
startled
to
find
it
ajar
burnett
was
so
habitually
cautious
that
i
knew
something
must
be
amiss
pushing
it
slowly
open
i
stole
noiselessly
into
the
passage
and
glanced
through
the
keyhole
of
the
door
which
led
into
the
little
parlour
it
was
well
i
had
not
tramped
in
two
policemen
and
a
man
in
plain
clothes
were
standing
round
a
hole
in
the
floor
and
the
whole
apartment
was
strewn
with
planks
on
a
chair
close
by
was
a
heap
of
retorts
bottles
and
canisters
while
three
bombs
lay
on
the
hearthstone
burnett
then
had
really
been
mixed
up
in
these
outrages
and
the
police
were
on
his
trail
if
indeed
they
had
not
already
arrested
him
and
what
about
my
own
position
the
best
thing
for
me
was
to
make
off
in
a
trice
for
the
entanglements
troubles
and
disgrace
in
which
capture
there
would
plunge
me
were
too
appalling
to
contemplate
instantly
i
glided
to
the
door
and
the
gate
slipped
out
hurriedly
into
the
street
fortunately
there
was
no
one
on
watch
or
my
arrest
would
have
been
speedy
as
it
was
i
rapidly
gained
the
main
street
and
was
soon
lost
in
the
broad
stream
of
pedestrians
having
still
three
hours
before
me
i
turned
into
a
confectioner
s
and
over
a
substantial
tea
endeavoured
to
think
the
matter
out
that
i
was
furious
with
burnett
goes
without
saying
only
his
fanatical
theories
separated
him
to
my
mind
from
the
common
murderer
but
that
he
should
be
caught
was
a
thought
utterly
revolting
for
i
had
liked
the
man
warmly
and
had
owed
my
life
to
his
pluck
no
our
friendship
must
cease
henceforth
but
it
was
at
least
my
duty
to
warn
him
if
still
at
large
of
the
discovery
but
how
there
was
only
one
course
open
to
me
outrages
or
no
outrages
police
or
no
police
i
must
be
present
at
the
meeting
in
the
park
that
night
it
was
quite
possible
that
burnett
ignorant
of
the
search
made
at
his
house
might
be
still
strolling
about
london
a
prize
for
the
first
aspiring
who
should
meet
him
yes
i
would
go
and
chance
meeting
the
group
for
i
should
mention
that
the
spot
for
the
was
unknown
to
all
i
knew
was
that
it
was
somewhere
near
the
pond
to
the
left
as
you
enter
from
the
queen
s
road
the
best
thing
i
could
think
of
was
to
idle
outside
the
park
until
i
could
climb
the
palings
unnoticed
the
sky
was
overcast
with
clouds
and
so
far
the
project
was
favoured
hazardous
as
was
the
affair
my
resolution
was
speedily
made
and
fortified
leaving
the
shop
i
sallied
out
for
a
stroll
and
passed
the
remaining
interval
as
best
i
could
then
i
called
for
a
hansom
and
leaping
in
ordered
the
driver
to
take
me
to
the
marble
arch
he
demurred
at
first
saying
the
journey
was
too
much
for
his
horse
at
that
time
of
night
but
his
scruples
were
silenced
by
the
offer
of
a
for
his
pains
the
mute
objections
of
his
steed
were
quashed
with
a
sharp
cut
of
the
whip
and
i
was
whirled
swiftly
on
to
an
adventure
which
was
to
beggar
the
wildest
creations
of
romance
at
the
marble
arch
i
dismissed
the
cab
and
walked
briskly
along
the
hyde
park
side
in
the
direction
of
notting
hill
i
had
gone
some
few
hundred
yards
when
a
hansom
sped
by
me
rapidly
and
a
face
within
it
flashed
on
my
vision
like
a
meteor
it
was
burnett
of
all
persons
shouting
and
waving
my
stick
i
rushed
wildly
in
chase
of
the
vehicle
and
by
dint
of
desperate
efforts
succeeded
at
last
in
stopping
it
as
i
approached
the
window
the
trap
flew
up
drive
on
man
drive
on
never
mind
growled
a
hoarse
voice
and
i
heard
the
click
of
a
revolver
here
i
am
i
said
getting
on
the
step
and
rapping
the
window
just
as
the
man
was
about
to
whip
up
burnett
stared
what
you
here
he
said
flinging
apart
the
leaves
come
in
quick
i
don
t
know
who
may
be
i
mounted
in
a
trice
and
the
cab
flew
on
faster
than
ever
look
here
i
said
breathlessly
i
have
come
to
warn
you
the
police
are
on
your
i
know
it
my
boy
he
rejoined
but
i
think
they
have
some
way
to
run
yet
no
fear
i
leave
london
in
an
what
was
the
man
talking
he
raving
or
boasting
or
what
hi
stop
we
got
out
and
the
cab
rolled
away
complacently
now
over
the
palings
cried
burnett
you
will
see
hartmann
yes
for
an
the
demon
of
curiosity
was
urgent
and
the
coast
seemed
clear
all
right
come
it
was
no
easy
task
for
me
tired
as
i
was
but
with
the
help
of
my
companion
i
got
through
it
somehow
illustration
a
salvo
of
cracks
of
revolvers
hallo
look
a
second
cab
probably
informed
by
ours
was
bearing
down
rapidly
with
two
occupants
one
of
whom
stood
excitedly
on
the
steps
detectives
we
re
spotted
i
leapt
to
the
ground
desperately
heavens
where
had
my
curiosity
landed
me
put
your
best
leg
foremost
and
follow
me
yelled
burnett
and
his
revolver
flashed
in
the
in
my
foolish
excitement
i
obeyed
him
as
we
rushed
along
i
heard
the
men
leap
out
and
their
boots
clink
on
the
iron
of
the
palings
i
felt
like
the
quarry
of
the
wild
huntsman
of
german
legend
if
arrested
in
such
a
plight
and
in
such
company
a
deluge
of
disgrace
if
not
worse
awaited
me
i
ran
like
a
deer
from
a
leopard
but
i
felt
i
could
not
hold
out
very
long
at
so
a
speed
shouted
burnett
brokenly
to
be
arrested
with
us
was
my
thought
or
was
more
murder
imminent
god
how
i
cursed
my
foolhardiness
and
useless
sacrifice
last
cried
my
companion
looking
back
over
his
shoulder
half
dizzy
with
fear
and
fatigue
i
made
a
despairing
sprint
when
my
foot
striking
a
root
i
was
hurled
violently
to
the
ground
all
i
remember
is
seeing
two
dusky
forms
rushing
up
and
burnett
hurriedly
wheeling
round
then
from
some
unknown
spot
broke
a
salvo
of
cracks
of
revolvers
a
heavy
body
fell
bleeding
across
my
face
and
almost
at
once
consciousness
left
me
chapter
a
strange
awakening
where
was
i
i
seemed
to
be
escaping
from
the
throes
of
some
horrible
dream
and
that
too
with
a
headache
past
endurance
i
stretched
out
my
right
hand
and
it
struck
something
cold
and
hard
i
opened
one
eye
with
an
effort
and
i
saw
three
men
bending
over
me
as
one
sees
spectres
in
a
nightmare
slowly
there
was
borne
upon
me
the
sound
of
voices
and
then
the
cruel
remembrance
of
that
struggle
i
was
in
a
police
cell
and
might
have
to
expiate
my
misfortunes
with
shame
or
even
death
who
was
to
believe
my
tale
horrified
at
the
thought
i
gave
utterance
to
a
deep
groan
there
s
not
much
up
with
your
pal
jack
said
one
of
the
spectres
aforesaid
give
him
some
more
whisky
he
s
hit
his
head
and
got
knocked
silly
that
s
what
was
this
a
surge
of
blood
coursed
through
me
i
made
a
supreme
effort
and
opened
both
eyes
fully
the
light
was
poor
but
it
was
enough
the
face
of
the
man
nearest
me
was
the
face
of
burnett
by
him
stood
a
artisan
and
by
all
that
is
marvellous
michael
schwartz
here
take
this
said
burnett
as
the
man
handed
him
the
glass
you
ll
be
all
right
in
a
i
drank
it
off
mechanically
and
imbued
with
new
strength
sat
bolt
upright
on
the
bench
burnett
watched
me
satirically
as
i
tried
to
cope
with
the
situation
by
the
light
of
a
small
lamp
hanging
in
a
niche
over
my
head
i
saw
that
i
was
in
a
low
small
room
about
twelve
feet
square
with
bare
walls
and
a
few
openings
near
the
ceiling
which
did
duty
no
doubt
for
windows
a
few
chests
several
chairs
and
a
table
of
the
same
greyish
colour
constituted
its
furniture
almost
directly
opposite
me
was
a
low
door
through
which
blew
gusts
of
chilly
mist
but
as
to
what
lay
beyond
it
i
could
not
of
course
form
a
conjecture
having
made
this
rapid
survey
i
turned
in
astonishment
to
my
three
stolid
companions
mutely
entreating
some
sort
of
clue
to
the
mystery
schwartz
then
made
an
attempt
to
rouse
me
by
asking
how
i
had
enjoyed
my
nocturnal
run
in
the
park
but
i
was
still
too
surprised
to
answer
i
was
thinking
how
burnett
could
have
carried
me
safe
away
where
he
could
possibly
have
brought
me
what
had
become
of
our
pursuers
where
the
mysterious
hartmann
was
who
had
fired
the
shots
these
and
a
multitude
of
like
riddles
rendered
me
speechless
with
bewilderment
when
i
had
more
or
less
fully
regained
voice
and
strength
i
turned
to
burnett
and
ignoring
the
impish
schwartz
said
where
on
earth
am
i
you
aren
t
on
earth
at
all
was
the
answer
and
the
three
burst
into
a
hearty
laugh
nor
in
heaven
added
the
speaker
for
if
so
neither
schwartz
nor
thomas
would
be
near
come
a
truce
to
humbug
am
i
in
london
on
the
river
in
an
anarchist
s
haunt
or
where
i
am
quite
serious
but
if
you
want
something
more
explicit
well
you
are
not
in
london
but
above
i
looked
at
the
three
wonderingly
a
faint
light
was
beginning
to
break
on
my
mind
but
no
the
thing
was
impossible
are
you
able
to
walk
now
said
burnett
come
schwartz
you
take
one
arm
and
i
ll
take
another
between
us
we
ll
give
constitutionalist
a
lesson
stanley
my
boy
in
all
your
days
you
never
saw
a
sight
such
as
i
am
going
to
show
you
but
it
is
nothing
to
what
we
shall
see
comrade
when
the
captain
gives
the
word
added
schwartz
thank
you
i
replied
i
will
lean
on
you
burnett
i
can
do
without
herr
schwartz
s
we
moved
across
the
room
hist
whispered
burnett
don
t
be
nasty
to
the
german
he
s
the
captain
s
right
hand
it
was
he
too
who
knocked
over
your
man
just
now
and
so
saved
you
from
trouble
take
my
advice
and
be
i
nodded
but
wait
a
moment
and
look
around
we
had
crossed
the
doorway
and
were
standing
in
a
sort
of
open
bulwarked
passage
which
evidently
ran
on
for
some
length
on
either
side
i
stepped
to
the
bulwarks
look
below
said
burnett
i
looked
long
and
earnestly
while
schwartz
and
thomas
stood
silently
in
the
background
it
was
a
strange
sight
and
it
was
some
time
ere
i
seized
its
meaning
it
was
very
dark
outside
the
only
light
being
that
coming
through
the
doorway
of
the
chamber
i
had
just
quitted
but
far
as
it
seemed
glittered
innumerable
specks
like
stars
a
curious
contrast
to
the
inkiness
of
the
cloudy
pall
above
us
as
i
gazed
down
into
the
depths
i
became
conscious
of
a
dull
murmur
like
that
of
whirling
machinery
and
forthwith
detected
a
constant
vibration
of
the
ledge
on
which
my
elbow
rested
then
and
then
only
the
truth
rushed
upon
me
illustration
i
was
being
carried
over
london
in
the
craft
of
hartmann
the
anarchist
i
was
being
carried
over
london
in
the
craft
of
hartmann
the
anarchist
horrified
with
my
the
potentialities
of
this
fell
vessel
dazed
clung
fiercely
to
burnett
s
arm
i
am
then
on
i
gasped
deck
of
the
put
in
burnett
behold
the
craft
that
shall
wreck
civilization
and
hurl
tyrannies
into
nothingness
but
my
gaze
was
fixed
on
those
lights
far
below
and
my
thought
was
not
of
the
tyrannies
i
had
left
but
of
the
tyranny
this
accursed
deck
might
minister
to
and
hartmann
they
said
was
remorseless
yes
growled
thomas
hoarsely
i
live
for
the
roar
of
the
schwartz
stirred
to
enthusiasm
shouted
a
brutal
parody
of
tennyson
the
dynamite
falls
on
castle
walls
and
splendid
buildings
old
in
story
the
column
shakes
the
tyrant
quakes
and
the
wild
wreckage
leaps
in
glory
throw
comrade
throw
set
the
wild
echoes
flying
throw
comrade
answer
wretches
dying
dying
if
the
remainder
of
the
crew
resembled
this
sample
i
was
caged
in
a
veritable
inferno
as
yet
of
course
i
knew
nothing
of
their
numbers
or
feelings
but
my
expectations
were
far
from
being
roseate
but
man
i
cried
turning
to
burnett
would
you
massacre
helpless
multitudes
you
who
prate
of
tyranny
would
you
also
play
the
of
tyrants
before
the
gathering
horror
all
my
wonder
at
the
had
vanished
i
felt
only
the
helpless
abject
dismay
with
which
one
confronts
an
appalling
but
inevitable
calamity
at
that
moment
some
disaster
to
the
aëronef
would
have
been
welcome
the
masterful
vice
of
the
fanatics
maddened
me
rebel
however
as
i
might
i
was
of
no
account
the
snake
that
snapped
at
the
file
had
more
in
his
favour
we
don
t
argue
here
said
burnett
we
act
if
you
want
arguments
you
must
wait
till
you
see
the
captain
disputes
with
us
are
so
even
he
was
becoming
surly
it
was
natural
enough
however
as
a
moment
s
reflection
showed
the
alligator
on
land
is
ordinarily
mild
enough
in
his
element
he
is
invariably
a
terrible
monster
the
suspect
anarchist
of
stepney
was
courteous
and
argumentative
but
the
free
and
independent
anarchist
of
the
dogmatic
and
brutal
it
was
obviously
best
policy
to
humour
him
for
he
alone
perhaps
might
stand
by
me
at
a
pinch
i
endeavoured
to
throw
oil
on
the
troubled
waters
you
used
not
to
mind
criticism
i
urged
oh
no
but
those
days
are
past
don
t
take
what
i
say
unkindly
for
we
all
mean
you
well
the
captain
will
always
talk
but
we
here
are
tired
of
it
we
only
exist
now
to
the
word
is
passed
so
you
will
consult
our
convenience
and
your
own
much
more
effectually
if
you
drop
all
such
homilies
for
the
yes
put
in
thomas
i
had
enough
of
it
in
london
fifteen
years
of
revolutionary
socialist
talking
and
nothing
ever
done
but
wait
a
few
weeks
and
i
warrant
it
will
be
said
that
we
here
have
atoned
wonderfully
well
for
arrears
come
a
glass
to
our
destined
destroyer
of
civilization
the
gallant
three
acting
on
this
hint
left
me
to
digest
their
advice
and
retired
within
how
long
i
remained
thinking
i
know
not
some
one
brought
me
a
chair
but
i
was
too
abstracted
to
thank
him
for
fully
an
hour
i
must
have
looked
down
on
those
twinkling
lights
with
a
terror
beyond
the
power
of
words
to
express
all
was
as
burnett
had
said
the
dream
of
hartmann
was
realized
the
exile
and
outcast
lately
sheltered
from
the
law
in
the
shadow
of
continental
cities
now
enjoyed
power
such
as
a
hundred
czars
could
not
hope
for
the
desperadoes
with
him
hated
by
and
hating
society
were
probably
one
and
all
devoured
by
lust
of
blood
and
revenge
the
three
i
knew
were
all
proscribed
men
loathing
not
only
the
landlord
and
capitalist
but
the
workers
who
would
most
of
them
have
rejoiced
over
their
capture
they
attacked
not
only
the
abuses
and
the
defects
but
the
very
foundations
of
society
their
thought
had
been
to
shatter
the
trophies
of
centuries
and
the
opportunity
had
come
at
last
one
resource
remained
what
they
meant
to
do
with
me
was
uncertain
but
my
relations
with
burnett
and
the
friendship
of
hartmann
s
mother
were
sufficient
to
avert
any
apprehension
of
violence
my
endeavour
then
henceforward
must
be
to
work
on
the
mind
of
hartmann
to
divert
this
engine
of
mischief
into
as
fair
a
course
as
possible
to
achieve
by
its
aid
a
durable
and
relatively
bloodless
social
revolution
and
to
reap
by
an
authority
so
secure
from
overthrow
a
harvest
of
beneficial
results
buoyed
up
by
these
brighter
thoughts
i
now
began
to
find
time
for
a
more
immediate
interest
what
of
this
wonderful
vessel
or
aëronef
itself
what
was
it
built
of
how
was
it
propelled
supported
steered
manned
constructed
rising
from
my
chair
i
felt
my
way
along
the
railing
forward
but
found
the
way
barred
by
some
door
or
partition
as
i
made
my
way
back
i
met
burnett
who
emerged
from
the
low
door
already
mentioned
what
exploring
already
he
said
it
s
no
good
at
this
hour
as
you
have
doubtless
discovered
come
inside
and
i
ll
see
you
are
made
cosy
for
the
night
you
must
want
sleep
i
followed
him
in
without
a
word
passing
into
the
chamber
he
pressed
a
spring
in
the
wall
and
a
concealed
door
flew
back
revealing
a
dark
recess
he
struck
a
light
and
there
became
visible
a
comfortable
berth
with
the
usual
appurtenances
of
a
homely
cabin
such
as
one
would
occupy
in
the
saloon
of
an
ordinary
steamer
by
the
way
i
said
you
have
not
told
me
what
happened
in
the
park
i
am
dying
to
it
is
easily
told
when
you
fell
the
two
detectives
were
up
in
a
moment
i
turned
round
meaning
to
shoot
but
before
i
emptied
a
barrel
crack
crack
crack
came
a
series
of
reports
from
aloft
and
both
men
were
settled
one
spinning
right
across
your
coat
is
covered
with
blood
the
explanation
is
that
thirty
feet
up
between
the
alleys
of
the
trees
floated
the
and
hartmann
and
schwartz
were
indulging
in
a
little
sport
i
very
soon
climbed
up
the
ladder
which
was
swinging
close
by
the
tree
we
were
to
have
come
to
and
you
were
shortly
afterwards
hauled
up
in
a
carefully
tied
sheet
why
did
we
take
you
on
board
i
am
surprised
at
your
asking
we
could
not
stop
and
the
idea
of
leaving
you
stunned
and
in
the
compromising
company
of
dead
men
was
not
arguable
would
you
have
relished
the
idea
of
a
trial
as
murderer
and
anarchist
you
meant
well
you
see
by
me
and
the
captain
was
strong
in
your
favour
some
of
the
men
know
of
you
and
no
one
had
a
bad
word
to
that
your
theories
were
rather
utopian
but
you
may
for
awhile
i
was
silent
i
thought
of
my
utopian
project
then
i
said
so
far
as
my
theories
go
i
will
confine
myself
now
to
one
remark
an
may
be
used
as
well
as
burnett
laughed
that
s
better
don
t
forget
however
to
define
your
view
of
us
to
the
captain
hallo
i
must
be
off
on
watch
an
electric
bell
tinkled
sharply
in
the
outer
chamber
just
before
turning
in
i
looked
closely
at
the
basin
of
my
stand
it
was
of
the
same
silvery
grey
colour
which
i
had
noted
on
the
walls
of
the
cabin
and
which
indeed
seemed
ubiquitous
a
sudden
thought
struck
me
i
emptied
out
the
water
and
lifted
it
up
its
weight
seemed
so
absurdly
small
that
i
could
hardly
believe
my
senses
but
one
thing
was
clear
the
mystery
of
the
thin
silvery
grey
plate
was
explained
it
was
out
of
such
materials
that
the
body
of
the
was
fashioned
the
riddle
of
schwartz
previously
half
brushed
aside
was
at
last
solved
completely
as
i
was
dropping
off
to
sleep
a
novel
reflection
assailed
me
what
would
lena
think
of
my
absence
of
this
terrible
night
in
the
park
she
would
not
of
course
dream
but
sleep
speedily
quenched
my
thinking
chapter
vi
on
the
deck
of
the
it
was
late
the
next
morning
when
thought
and
feeling
came
back
to
me
the
blurred
imagery
of
my
dreams
mingling
strangely
with
the
memories
of
the
preceding
night
despite
a
slight
headache
and
a
suspicion
or
two
of
giddiness
i
felt
as
well
as
could
be
expected
and
lying
back
snugly
on
my
pillow
began
to
meditate
rising
for
once
my
resolution
was
quick
in
the
making
my
uncle
used
to
say
that
all
things
considered
life
was
not
worth
the
trouble
of
dressing
but
on
this
particular
morning
it
most
certainly
was
the
apprehensions
of
the
past
night
had
given
way
to
a
hopeful
spirit
while
the
interest
of
exploring
this
aëronef
thrilled
me
through
and
through
i
was
about
to
spring
out
of
the
berth
in
readiness
for
the
labours
of
the
toilet
when
burnett
looked
in
through
the
door
all
right
glad
to
hear
it
where
are
we
over
the
north
sea
take
my
advice
and
get
up
sharp
the
captain
has
asked
to
see
you
you
ll
find
me
knocking
about
somewhere
round
here
when
you
re
thoroughly
alive
to
the
situation
i
was
not
long
in
getting
into
my
clothes
but
my
disgust
was
great
on
finding
sundry
splashes
of
blood
on
my
coat
a
souvenir
of
my
luckless
pursuer
in
the
excitement
and
darkness
i
had
overlooked
these
hideous
traces
which
now
seemed
to
threaten
me
with
the
brand
of
cain
throwing
aside
the
polluted
garment
i
stepped
into
the
outer
chamber
my
pleasure
quite
overcast
for
the
moment
burnett
was
there
and
a
hearty
breakfast
was
awaiting
me
to
which
i
promised
to
do
summary
and
sweeping
justice
the
room
but
feebly
apparent
the
foregoing
night
was
now
flooded
with
the
sunlight
but
the
height
at
which
we
floated
rendered
the
air
most
chilly
and
penetrating
the
silvery
grey
colour
of
the
walls
floor
chairs
benches
tables
and
even
the
dishes
and
mugs
wrought
on
me
an
impressive
effect
curiously
set
off
by
the
red
cap
worn
by
burnett
through
the
open
doorway
gleamed
the
same
silvery
grey
livery
of
the
flooring
and
bulwark
of
the
passage
already
mentioned
and
framed
as
it
were
in
silver
glowed
a
truly
magnificent
this
skyscape
however
was
unstable
mass
after
mass
of
mist
shaped
into
turrets
battlements
and
mountains
rolled
by
in
picturesque
splendour
bearing
artistic
testimony
to
the
speed
at
which
we
or
they
were
moving
beautiful
isn
t
it
said
burnett
here
eat
your
breakfast
and
then
i
ll
show
you
round
our
cloud
empire
or
perhaps
you
had
best
see
the
captain
as
soon
as
i
said
i
thought
that
would
be
best
but
where
s
your
coat
man
oh
i
remember
wait
and
i
ll
fetch
you
one
of
in
a
short
time
the
missing
garment
was
made
good
and
i
was
falling
to
with
avidity
how
do
you
manage
your
meals
and
service
here
have
you
cooks
or
servants
of
course
not
we
are
anarchists
and
everything
depends
on
private
initiative
every
man
is
as
good
as
another
and
every
man
is
a
volunteer
later
on
you
will
be
expected
to
bestir
yourself
but
how
do
you
avoid
chaos
there
is
no
chaos
to
avoid
outside
the
and
there
is
little
a
man
can
not
quickly
learn
to
do
at
need
we
are
very
simple
in
our
is
part
of
our
consequently
have
a
deal
of
leisure
the
watches
are
the
worst
part
for
the
captain
is
very
ah
wait
a
minute
what
authority
has
he
the
authority
of
the
soul
of
this
enterprise
and
its
best
man
we
would
voluntarily
support
him
in
a
crisis
five
days
ago
a
couple
of
italians
turned
rusty
he
shot
both
where
they
stood
and
the
men
in
their
hearts
approved
of
it
but
he
is
an
iron
man
wait
till
you
see
him
is
any
one
on
the
free
to
go
where
he
likes
yes
except
into
the
captain
s
quarters
to
pass
there
a
permit
is
required
to
all
except
myself
schwartz
and
thomas
the
watchers
pass
through
every
three
hours
and
a
passage
runs
from
it
to
the
and
magazine
below
you
may
guess
what
the
latter
how
many
men
are
aboard
excluding
ourselves
eight
are
germans
six
englishmen
four
french
two
russians
one
an
italian
and
the
others
swiss
some
of
those
whom
hartmann
employed
at
berne
was
that
where
the
was
built
that
s
it
hartmann
schwartz
and
his
swiss
workmen
put
her
together
he
made
money
there
as
you
know
and
this
was
his
grand
investment
it
was
kept
beautifully
dark
in
the
wooded
grounds
of
his
villa
we
are
going
there
now
so
you
will
see
the
place
for
but
does
any
one
know
of
the
no
outsider
probably
who
would
be
believed
if
he
said
anything
we
have
our
friends
down
below
of
you
they
are
mum
the
hour
has
not
yet
struck
but
the
preparations
for
the
festival
are
being
merrily
carried
out
the
is
a
secret
for
the
present
to
avoid
being
seen
we
take
every
precaution
possible
and
never
approach
the
ground
except
at
night
in
the
daytime
well
there
are
clouds
and
if
none
we
simply
mount
higher
and
then
our
colour
is
enough
to
conceal
but
what
if
you
meet
a
balloon
oh
there
s
very
little
chance
of
that
and
if
there
was
the
balloonist
might
find
cause
to
regret
the
meeting
but
come
and
i
ll
take
you
round
to
the
captain
he
is
a
better
spokesman
than
right
you
we
stepped
out
on
to
the
passage
and
rushing
to
the
bulwark
if
i
may
so
call
it
i
gazed
rapturously
into
the
abyss
below
it
was
indeed
a
glorious
sight
the
clouds
hung
around
and
below
us
but
here
and
there
through
their
rents
flashed
the
blue
of
a
waste
of
rolling
waters
ever
and
anon
these
gaps
would
be
speckled
with
rushing
whose
cries
mellowed
by
the
distance
broke
on
the
ear
like
music
above
in
the
clear
blue
sky
shone
the
sun
at
the
keystone
of
his
low
winter
arch
lighting
up
the
cloud
masses
with
a
splendour
words
can
not
describe
far
ahead
through
a
break
on
my
right
a
faint
thin
streak
like
distant
land
seemed
visible
hallo
i
cried
look
there
land
burnett
shaded
his
eyes
i
can
see
nothing
ah
yes
by
jove
who
s
on
watch
we
ought
to
be
as
he
spoke
a
sudden
pitch
of
the
aëronef
nearly
upset
speed
rapidly
increased
and
the
wind
became
positively
cutting
we
are
rising
fast
said
burnett
see
we
are
leaving
the
far
below
but
a
new
marvel
had
just
caught
my
eye
and
clinging
to
the
i
gazed
upwards
in
astonishment
the
wall
of
the
chamber
behind
us
was
continuous
with
the
main
mass
of
the
aëronef
which
looking
from
where
we
stood
exhibited
the
graceful
lines
of
a
ship
s
hull
round
this
hull
and
presumably
up
it
ran
the
railed
passage
where
we
were
standing
communicating
here
and
there
with
doorways
let
into
the
grey
side
some
thirty
feet
above
us
this
side
curved
upwards
and
inwards
so
as
to
terminate
in
a
flat
railed
deck
on
which
a
few
moving
heads
were
just
visible
but
above
this
again
rose
a
forest
of
thin
grey
poles
running
up
to
a
vast
oblong
aëroplane
which
stretched
some
way
beyond
the
hull
all
these
props
were
carefully
stayed
together
and
those
towards
the
bow
were
somewhat
higher
than
those
in
the
stern
provision
being
thus
made
for
the
inclination
of
the
aëroplane
consistently
with
due
maintenance
of
the
hull
s
equilibrium
below
in
the
latter
part
of
the
nineteenth
century
much
progress
had
been
made
in
experiments
with
aëroplanes
those
of
maxim
being
particularly
suggestive
and
interesting
i
was
therefore
at
no
loss
to
probe
the
significance
of
this
portion
of
the
mechanism
the
captain
wishes
to
see
you
said
burnett
who
was
talking
to
a
fellow
by
the
doorway
come
illustration
i
gazed
upwards
in
astonishment
he
stepped
briskly
along
the
passage
and
when
we
had
gone
some
fifteen
yards
turned
up
one
of
the
alleys
entering
behind
him
i
came
to
a
small
court
surrounded
with
rooms
and
cabins
leaving
which
we
ascended
a
spiral
staircase
to
the
upper
deck
glancing
hastily
around
i
saw
five
or
six
men
pacing
about
chatting
while
from
other
courts
below
came
the
sounds
of
singing
and
laughter
this
deck
which
capped
the
entire
hull
was
no
less
than
eighty
yards
in
length
with
an
extreme
breadth
of
at
least
broad
at
the
stern
it
narrowed
off
to
a
sharp
point
at
the
bow
the
props
attached
to
the
aëroplane
were
set
in
six
rows
curving
close
together
amidships
where
there
stood
a
small
circular
citadel
evidently
the
stronghold
of
the
captain
here
were
mounted
three
or
four
cannon
of
the
sort
fashioned
out
of
the
same
grey
substance
as
the
but
the
utility
of
which
in
a
vessel
carrying
dynamite
was
not
immediately
obvious
the
citadel
itself
bore
no
outward
signs
of
comfort
it
had
four
square
windows
and
a
plain
hole
of
an
entrance
let
into
bare
shining
walls
an
exterior
wall
six
feet
high
surmounted
with
spikes
and
having
here
and
there
a
recess
sheltering
a
machine
gun
enclosed
it
a
fitter
abode
for
the
man
i
could
not
conceive
sullen
isolated
and
menacing
it
inspired
me
with
a
vague
premonitory
dread
burnett
strode
up
to
the
entrance
and
pressed
a
knob
i
heard
the
ting
of
an
electric
bell
and
a
man
thomas
if
i
remember
aright
came
out
and
said
the
captain
would
see
me
alone
mastering
some
natural
excitement
i
bowed
and
followed
him
in
we
passed
through
the
inner
portal
and
found
ourselves
in
a
narrow
hall
flights
of
steps
from
which
led
down
into
the
inmost
vitals
of
the
on
our
right
was
a
door
half
open
my
escort
motioned
me
to
enter
and
pulling
the
door
to
left
me
face
to
face
with
hartmann
chapter
vii
the
captain
of
the
ten
years
had
not
rolled
away
for
nothing
still
the
face
which
looked
into
mine
vividly
recalled
my
glimpse
into
the
album
in
the
little
villa
at
islington
seated
before
a
studded
with
knobs
of
electric
bells
and
heaped
with
maps
and
instruments
sat
a
man
with
straight
piercing
glance
and
a
forehead
physiognomists
would
have
envied
there
was
the
same
independent
look
the
same
cruel
hardness
that
had
stamped
the
mien
of
the
youth
but
the
old
impetuous
air
had
given
way
to
a
cold
inflexible
sedateness
far
more
appropriate
to
the
dread
master
of
the
as
i
advanced
into
the
room
he
rose
a
grand
specimen
of
manhood
standing
full
six
feet
three
inches
in
his
shoes
he
shook
hands
more
warmly
than
i
had
expected
and
motioned
me
tacitly
to
a
seat
you
have
heard
about
my
mischance
i
began
tentatively
i
had
hoped
to
meet
you
for
an
hour
or
so
but
fear
i
have
outstayed
my
i
felt
he
was
weighing
me
in
the
balance
i
know
probably
more
of
that
mischance
than
you
do
those
luckless
detectives
were
certainly
embarrassing
but
after
all
they
afforded
us
an
incident
of
course
you
can
understand
why
we
were
bound
not
to
leave
you
and
now
that
you
are
restored
to
vigour
are
you
sorry
that
you
have
seen
the
on
the
contrary
i
am
lost
in
wonder
but
look
sir
at
the
cost
of
my
privilege
these
unfortunate
men
you
refer
to
haunt
me
and
the
purpose
of
this
vessel
i
must
tell
you
fairly
appals
he
listened
approvingly
a
man
in
his
position
can
well
afford
to
be
tolerant
oh
the
incidents
must
be
looked
for
do
generals
dissolve
into
tears
when
two
hostile
sentries
have
to
be
shot
do
they
shrink
from
the
wholesale
slaughter
which
every
campaign
entails
nonsense
sir
nonsense
but
your
war
is
not
against
this
or
that
army
or
nation
but
against
civilization
as
a
i
was
determined
to
take
the
bull
by
the
horns
at
the
outset
you
can
scarcely
justify
that
on
those
easily
enough
the
victory
in
view
is
the
regeneration
of
man
the
cost
will
be
some
thousands
perhaps
hundreds
of
thousands
or
millions
of
lives
the
assailants
are
our
small
but
legitimate
army
we
can
say
that
our
friends
below
are
sincerely
devoted
to
us
and
to
our
objects
most
of
the
ordinary
soldiers
of
your
princes
have
to
be
drummed
into
the
ranks
either
by
want
or
the
law
as
to
the
cost
look
back
on
history
how
many
wars
in
those
annals
have
been
waged
for
the
service
of
mankind
on
how
many
massacres
has
one
ray
of
utility
shone
now
you
must
admit
that
our
ideal
is
a
worthy
one
even
if
unattainable
at
the
worst
we
can
shed
no
more
blood
than
did
a
tamerlane
or
a
certainly
the
ideal
is
a
grand
one
and
might
if
reliable
be
worth
the
outlay
but
how
many
of
your
crew
appreciate
its
beauty
most
i
will
venture
love
destruction
for
its
own
sake
is
schwartz
a
reformer
is
thomas
my
crew
are
enthusiasts
stanley
nay
if
you
like
fiends
of
destruction
every
man
is
selected
by
myself
every
man
is
an
outlaw
from
society
and
most
have
shed
blood
they
burn
to
revenge
on
society
the
evils
which
they
have
received
or
given
the
appropriate
occasion
would
receive
from
it
in
this
way
i
secure
resolute
fiery
and
unflinching
soldiers
but
do
not
mistake
my
meaning
i
know
how
to
these
i
regard
me
according
to
addison
s
simile
as
the
angel
who
guides
the
whirlwind
look
on
these
as
you
will
they
are
like
the
creatures
generated
in
decaying
bodies
they
are
the
maggots
of
civilization
the
harvest
of
the
dragons
teeth
sown
in
past
centuries
the
frankenstein
s
monsters
of
civilization
which
are
born
to
hate
their
father
you
have
read
milton
of
course
do
you
recall
the
passage
about
sin
and
the
birth
of
death
who
gnaws
his
wretched
parent
s
vitals
it
is
the
sin
of
this
industrial
age
which
has
bred
the
crew
of
this
but
are
all
these
men
here
morally
rotten
the
man
schwartz
they
call
your
shadow
is
he
a
type
not
at
all
your
friend
burnett
who
has
just
startled
the
kensington
notables
seems
sound
he
is
a
madman
of
the
more
reputable
sort
there
is
another
like
him
with
us
a
german
of
the
name
of
brandt
a
philosopher
recruited
from
the
ranks
of
the
berlin
may
i
ask
you
two
important
questions
say
the
world
says
you
were
once
a
mere
fanatical
destroyer
have
you
changed
your
creed
you
refer
to
my
old
days
yes
you
are
right
i
was
then
a
pessimist
and
despaired
of
everything
around
and
you
became
an
to
revenge
myself
on
the
race
which
produced
and
then
wearied
me
i
had
no
tutor
but
schwartz
a
faithful
fellow
but
a
mere
iconoclast
our
idea
was
simple
enough
we
were
to
raze
raze
raze
and
let
the
future
look
to
itself
our
mistake
was
in
dreaming
even
of
moderate
success
immunity
from
the
police
was
impossible
but
those
wasted
days
are
he
smiled
ironically
and
bent
his
gaze
on
the
wall
devouring
as
it
seemed
some
specially
pleasurable
object
following
its
direction
i
became
aware
of
a
splendid
sketch
of
the
which
constituted
the
sole
æsthetic
appanage
of
this
singular
sanctum
what
a
contrast
it
must
have
awakened
between
his
present
power
and
the
abjectness
of
the
fugitive
of
ten
years
back
one
more
question
how
do
you
propose
to
conquer
now
you
have
the
i
can
not
say
much
as
yet
but
understand
the
day
when
the
first
bomb
falls
will
witness
outbreaks
in
every
great
city
in
europe
we
have
some
adherents
in
london
many
more
in
paris
berlin
and
will
stir
the
tumult
below
london
is
my
objective
to
start
with
during
the
tempests
of
bombs
the
anarchists
below
will
fire
the
streets
in
all
directions
rouse
up
the
populace
and
let
loose
pandemonium
upon
earth
in
the
confusion
due
to
our
attack
order
and
precautions
will
be
you
horrify
me
and
the
object
is
as
i
repeat
to
wreck
civilization
if
you
are
interested
brandt
will
probably
attract
you
he
lectures
on
the
upper
deck
we
are
rousseaus
who
advocate
a
return
to
a
simpler
but
how
is
the
new
order
to
take
shape
how
educe
system
from
chaos
we
want
no
more
systems
or
constitutions
shall
have
anarchy
men
will
effect
all
by
voluntary
association
and
abjure
the
foulness
of
the
modern
and
but
can
you
expect
the
more
brutal
classes
to
thrive
under
this
system
will
they
not
rather
degenerate
into
savagery
you
forget
the
will
still
sail
the
breeze
and
she
will
then
have
her
fleet
of
what
you
do
not
propose
then
to
leave
anarchy
unseasoned
not
at
transition
would
be
far
too
severe
some
supervision
must
necessarily
be
exercised
but
as
a
rule
it
will
never
be
more
than
your
ideal
captain
amazes
me
but
the
prospect
i
admit
is
splendid
were
you
to
succeed
i
say
at
once
that
the
return
would
well
repay
the
outlay
i
am
a
socialist
you
know
but
i
have
felt
how
selfishness
and
the
risks
of
reaction
hampered
all
our
most
promising
plans
the
egotism
of
democrats
is
voracious
it
is
the
curse
of
our
movement
but
this
scheme
of
supervised
anarchy
well
in
some
ways
it
is
it
is
only
a
the
was
once
only
a
theory
rejoined
hartmann
one
word
now
stanley
i
ask
you
neither
to
join
us
nor
to
agree
with
us
you
are
your
own
master
and
should
you
dislike
this
tour
say
the
word
and
at
nightfall
you
shall
be
landed
in
france
if
you
elect
to
stay
well
and
good
i
am
your
debtor
don
t
look
surprised
for
you
have
been
a
good
friend
to
my
mother
and
least
of
all
men
i
forget
debts
i
only
ask
you
to
observe
silence
respecting
our
conversations
and
never
to
interfere
in
anything
you
see
in
progress
which
is
it
to
be
i
elect
to
stay
i
can
do
no
good
by
leaving
and
by
staying
i
court
an
absolutely
unique
experience
believe
me
too
captain
i
am
not
insensible
to
what
you
have
said
between
the
anarchist
schwartz
and
yourself
yawns
an
one
thing
captain
could
i
find
means
to
despatch
a
letter
to
a
lady
i
added
as
i
saw
his
eyebrows
rise
slightly
certainly
if
you
conform
to
the
rules
voluntarily
agreed
upon
you
are
not
one
of
will
not
therefore
object
to
the
letter
being
read
i
will
spare
you
undue
annoyance
by
formally
glancing
over
the
rule
is
reasonable
enough
captain
and
requires
no
it
shall
be
given
to
one
of
the
delegates
when
we
touch
land
in
switzerland
a
convention
of
importance
is
to
be
held
there
but
come
i
will
take
you
round
the
and
striding
by
me
he
passed
out
of
the
study
what
was
that
land
visible
just
now
captain
i
asked
as
we
reached
one
of
the
stairways
that
led
down
into
the
vessel
holland
the
course
has
since
been
altered
we
find
the
clouds
are
lifting
and
not
wishing
to
run
too
high
are
making
off
towards
the
english
channel
we
shall
cross
france
steering
above
havre
along
the
channel
of
the
seine
over
paris
dijon
the
saone
and
the
jura
mountains
into
switzerland
i
had
intended
to
go
to
berne
but
have
been
forced
to
change
my
plans
we
shall
stop
over
a
forest
not
far
from
lake
leman
where
some
fifty
delegates
will
meet
us
after
that
we
return
to
for
war
for
down
into
the
depths
of
the
we
went
the
spiral
stair
running
down
a
deep
and
seemingly
interminable
well
on
reaching
the
bottom
my
conductor
turned
off
into
a
passage
brightly
lit
up
with
the
electric
light
a
rumble
and
thud
of
machinery
broke
on
the
ear
and
in
a
few
seconds
we
stood
in
the
of
the
my
readers
are
aware
of
the
wonderful
advances
in
electricity
made
in
the
early
part
of
the
twentieth
century
and
i
need
not
therefore
recapitulate
them
here
in
the
mechanism
of
this
there
was
nothing
specially
peculiar
but
the
appropriation
of
the
best
modern
inventions
left
nothing
to
be
desired
electricity
according
to
the
newly
introduced
method
being
generated
directly
from
coal
the
force
at
the
disposal
of
the
aëronaut
was
colossal
and
what
was
even
more
expedient
obtained
for
a
trifling
outlay
of
fuel
a
short
but
very
thick
shaft
revolving
with
great
speed
led
i
was
told
to
a
screw
without
and
by
the
sides
of
this
monster
two
others
of
far
humbler
dimensions
were
resting
idly
on
their
rollers
i
was
now
able
to
solve
the
riddle
of
the
flight
the
buoyancy
of
the
vessel
was
that
of
an
inclined
plane
driven
rapidly
through
the
air
by
a
screw
a
device
first
prominently
brought
into
notice
by
the
experiments
of
maxim
the
albeit
light
was
of
course
under
normal
conditions
greatly
heavier
than
the
quantity
of
air
she
condition
indeed
of
any
real
mastery
over
the
subtle
element
she
dwelt
in
the
balloon
is
a
mere
toy
at
the
mercy
of
the
gale
and
its
seemed
wholly
indifferent
to
both
but
desirous
of
probing
the
problem
to
the
bottom
i
put
hartmann
the
what
would
happen
supposing
that
shaft
broke
or
the
machinery
somehow
got
out
of
order
well
we
should
fall
yes
but
very
gradually
at
first
so
long
as
our
speed
was
fairly
well
maintained
the
aëroplane
as
you
know
will
only
buoy
us
up
on
the
condition
that
we
move
and
that
pretty
quickly
still
there
are
always
the
two
spare
steering
screws
to
fall
back
but
what
if
they
stopped
as
well
it
s
most
unlikely
that
they
would
stop
the
three
shafts
are
worked
independently
but
if
they
did
the
would
have
to
be
the
yes
you
have
doubtless
been
surprised
at
the
huge
size
of
the
well
the
main
parts
of
the
upper
and
middle
portions
of
her
hull
are
nothing
more
nor
less
than
a
succession
of
compartments
filled
with
hydrogen
introduced
at
a
high
temperature
so
as
to
yield
the
maximum
amount
of
buoyancy
below
these
compartments
again
lie
the
sand
reservoirs
when
these
latter
are
three
parts
full
their
natural
effect
is
to
keep
the
at
about
the
level
of
the
sea
supposing
that
is
to
say
the
screws
are
completely
stopped
if
your
event
was
to
happen
the
watch
in
the
would
simply
shift
the
a
quantity
of
ballast
would
be
released
and
we
should
at
once
begin
to
rise
we
can
thus
regulate
our
weight
at
will
the
secret
of
it
all
is
the
marvellous
lightness
of
these
walls
i
am
not
free
to
tell
you
to
what
discovery
that
lightness
is
due
but
you
may
test
and
analyze
as
much
as
you
like
on
the
off
chance
of
a
correct
it
s
all
superb
was
my
enthusiastic
comment
but
how
about
an
ordinary
complete
descent
to
earth
a
very
simple
matter
from
the
outer
gallery
the
looks
as
if
her
bottom
was
gently
curved
terminating
in
the
customary
orthodox
keel
that
is
what
the
upper
lines
suggest
but
three
feet
below
the
level
at
which
we
stand
lies
a
flat
projecting
bottom
studded
underneath
with
springs
resting
on
the
axles
of
wheels
i
wish
to
touch
land
i
press
certain
knobs
and
this
that
perhaps
all
three
screws
ease
off
run
down
or
may
be
reversed
the
then
sweeps
onward
much
after
the
fashion
of
an
albatross
with
outspread
motionless
wings
steering
is
ting
in
the
sets
this
or
that
side
screw
shaft
rotating
falls
then
faster
and
faster
meanwhile
i
stand
by
the
pull
this
and
the
stern
rises
we
swoop
down
like
a
hawk
i
pull
that
the
bow
rises
the
impetus
thus
gained
carries
the
in
a
noble
curve
aloft
finally
she
hovers
over
the
ground
and
opening
a
hydrogen
valve
i
adjust
her
descent
delicately
so
as
to
spare
the
but
you
must
lose
a
great
deal
of
hydrogen
in
this
illustration
looking
down
into
space
not
so
much
as
you
would
think
and
besides
the
loss
is
of
no
moment
we
carry
an
immense
quantity
of
the
gas
compressed
in
tubes
at
a
pressure
of
many
thousand
pounds
to
the
square
inch
what
loss
there
is
can
therefore
always
be
made
good
at
intervals
you
will
have
a
chance
of
watching
our
procedure
very
shortly
as
we
sand
up
and
replenish
three
or
four
at
a
not
very
far
we
passed
through
the
passage
back
to
the
well
where
for
fifty
feet
above
us
the
long
stair
curled
upward
to
the
citadel
these
side
walls
observed
hartmann
with
those
constituting
the
outer
skin
of
the
bound
the
huge
gas
compartments
i
mentioned
they
are
independent
so
that
serious
accidents
are
impossible
in
the
cavities
and
corridors
between
them
lie
the
cabins
and
quarters
of
the
crew
the
courts
enclosed
by
which
you
must
have
noticed
from
the
upper
deck
all
these
courts
open
on
to
the
outer
gallery
and
communicate
by
the
deck
with
the
common
room
to
the
centre
divisions
of
the
ship
the
and
the
no
one
has
access
except
with
my
leave
this
and
he
opened
a
small
carefully
guarded
door
is
the
he
pressed
a
button
and
the
gleam
of
a
vacuum
lamp
pierced
the
darkness
half
awestruck
i
stepped
within
there
is
nothing
to
see
now
we
have
to
be
so
cautious
stay
look
he
seized
a
ring
and
lifted
a
trap
in
the
floor
i
started
back
for
it
opened
into
a
well
some
three
feet
deep
and
then
into
the
aërial
abyss
below
that
well
will
vomit
disaster
one
he
let
down
the
trap
and
we
left
the
gloomy
chamber
the
you
see
stanley
combines
the
advantages
of
the
bird
and
the
balloon
of
the
aëronef
and
the
aërostat
it
has
been
my
dream
from
boyhood
and
at
last
after
infinite
pains
it
is
realized
still
even
for
me
it
is
but
a
means
to
an
end
but
you
will
admit
it
is
not
a
bad
we
ascended
the
stairway
and
stepped
on
to
the
upper
deck
some
twenty
men
were
assembled
and
they
respectfully
saluted
my
companion
comrades
he
said
my
friend
stanley
comes
among
you
though
he
is
not
yet
one
of
us
he
may
be
his
devotion
to
the
cause
of
labour
is
his
passport
take
him
and
treat
him
as
our
he
bowed
to
me
and
retired
into
his
citadel
the
crew
crowded
eagerly
round
me
with
a
warmth
wholly
unlooked
for
the
terrible
captain
had
evidently
not
spoken
in
vain
during
the
next
i
was
escorted
round
their
quarters
in
state
naturally
i
volunteered
my
services
for
the
necessary
work
of
the
vessel
but
somewhat
to
my
surprise
was
firmly
asked
to
desist
a
guest
they
said
could
not
be
expected
to
conform
to
their
habits
at
once
and
two
of
the
objectors
were
urgent
in
entreating
me
to
accept
their
services
in
the
end
i
was
vanquished
not
entirely
to
my
regret
and
the
first
day
of
my
sojourn
on
the
passed
pleasantly
enough
would
that
all
the
others
had
passed
in
a
like
manner
for
in
that
case
i
should
have
to
describe
an
elysium
instead
of
an
inferno
chapter
viii
a
strange
voyage
released
for
the
moment
from
care
i
gave
myself
up
to
the
full
enjoyment
of
the
voyage
of
the
grandeur
of
the
cloud
pictures
the
glory
of
the
sunsets
and
the
twilights
of
the
moonlight
flooding
our
decks
as
we
sped
over
the
streaky
mists
below
of
the
mystic
passage
by
night
and
the
blushes
of
early
morn
i
can
not
trust
myself
to
speak
such
things
ordinarily
belittle
words
but
framed
in
the
romance
of
this
voyage
they
wrought
indescribable
effects
upon
me
the
economist
was
merged
in
the
artist
i
no
longer
reasoned
but
lay
bathed
in
the
flood
of
feeling
and
not
only
these
beauties
enthralled
me
but
the
motion
of
the
was
itself
a
poem
have
you
never
in
the
drowsy
noon
of
a
long
summer
s
day
lain
back
on
the
sward
watching
the
evolutions
of
a
rook
round
its
elm
noted
the
rapturous
poise
of
its
wings
and
the
easy
grace
of
its
flight
even
such
was
the
flight
of
the
let
me
detail
an
incident
which
took
place
and
the
ground
for
my
enthusiasm
will
be
obvious
hartmann
had
summoned
me
to
his
study
and
taken
me
along
to
the
the
passage
to
which
ran
under
deck
from
the
citadel
the
tower
capped
with
apparatus
for
night
work
when
requisite
rested
on
the
nozzle
or
projecting
bow
of
the
aëronef
and
was
so
constructed
as
to
command
a
superb
outlook
two
men
were
on
watch
when
we
arrived
and
these
respectfully
saluted
the
captain
is
the
shore
far
off
about
five
any
vessels
in
sight
no
all
now
stanley
said
he
turning
to
me
i
am
going
to
show
you
how
the
obeys
its
master
we
require
to
load
up
with
sand
and
refill
five
or
six
of
the
hydrogen
compartments
that
strip
yonder
is
one
of
our
favourite
docks
watch
he
pressed
one
of
the
knobs
communicating
with
the
that
stops
the
force

to
the
main
shaft
the
revolutions
of
which
will
speedily
ease
down
we
are
falling
fast
do
you
observe
hold
tight
there
illustration
over
the
sea
the
bow
dipped
several
degrees
and
we
shot
onward
and
downward
like
an
arrow
were
we
rushing
into
the
sea
the
billows
of
which
seemed
to
leap
up
at
us
larger
and
larger
each
second
another
pitch
the
bow
rose
considerably
and
we
were
carried
by
the
aëroplane
hundreds
of
yards
upwards
the
onward
motion
being
at
the
same
time
inconceivably
rapid
once
more
these
tactics
were
repeated
and
so
closely
we
neared
the
ocean
that
the
waves
must
have
splashed
the
meantime
hartmann
rapidly
twisted
a
wheel
with
each
hand
this
works
the
sand
levers
of
the
bow
that
of
the
stern
ballast
is
dropping
at
once
we
rose
and
to
my
unconcealed
wonder
stopped
at
a
height
of
about
feet
above
still
however
riding
forward
with
a
lazy
careless
motion
we
were
now
near
the
whither
a
few
turns
of
the
screw
bore
us
gently
hartmann
watching
his
opportunity
began
twisting
a
small
wheel
in
the
centre
of
a
medley
of
others
a
hydrogen
we
fell
sharply
but
a
touch
to
the
other
wheels
eased
us
and
alighting
gently
on
the
spit
the
wheels
of
the
were
buried
up
to
their
naves
it
was
then
getting
late
so
every
one
was
as
expeditious
as
possible
first
bag
after
bag
of
sand
was
dried
and
cast
into
the
sand
reservoirs
binding
the
craft
immovably
to
the
dune
the
process
resembled
a
coaling
operation
at
port
saïd
and
amused
me
greatly
i
worked
hard
and
earned
a
shower
of
praises
afterwards
i
stood
by
while
the
five
huge
centre
compartments
were
filled
with
the
rarefied
gas
it
was
a
tedious
affair
because
each
in
turn
had
to
be
pumped
and
out
then
filled
with
cold
hydrogen
then
with
a
fresh
supply
highly
heated
so
as
to
contract
and
become
rare
on
cooling
about
one
hour
was
consumed
in
the
operation
and
at
its
close
the
still
lay
motionless
on
the
everything
however
having
been
duly
overhauled
the
sand
levers
were
gently
worked
the
surplus
ballast
slipped
away
and
breaking
away
from
our
couch
we
floated
twenty
feet
above
the
spit
the
three
screws
were
then
set
rotating
and
speed
having
been
attained
we
curved
upwards
into
the
bosom
of
the
sunset
clouds
an
experience
more
superb
romance
itself
could
not
furnish
later
on
we
passed
at
high
speed
over
havre
the
lights
of
which
twinkled
merrily
through
a
mist
patch
next
rouen
glided
away
beneath
us
and
at
seven
we
swept
over
the
gorgeous
city
of
paris
satiated
in
some
measure
with
these
sights
i
stepped
down
into
a
court
and
entered
the
cosy
burnett
was
there
and
brandt
the
philosopher
whom
hartmann
had
mentioned
i
was
very
fond
of
german
thought
and
did
not
fail
to
improve
the
timely
occasion
brandt
was
not
only
a
metaphysician
but
readily
listened
to
my
very
guarded
criticisms
of
the
anarchists
he
was
however
inflexible
and
professed
the
most
supreme
confidence
in
hartmann
he
is
the
heart
of
the
enterprise
and
it
was
he
who
gave
the
wings
look
at
what
he
effected
with
small
resources
and
you
may
rely
on
him
with
he
evinced
a
sturdy
faith
in
the
scheme
of
supervision
and
prophesied
as
its
result
a
grand
moral
and
intellectual
regeneration
of
man
but
he
added
the
initial
blows
will
be
terrible
one
remark
filled
me
with
apprehension
london
he
said
in
three
days
will
be
mere
shambles
with
the
roof
heavens
i
cried
so
soon
yes
the
object
of
this
trip
is
merely
to
settle
details
with
some
terrestrial
friends
who
meet
us
from
the
various
affiliated
bodies
of
shortly
afterwards
i
had
an
interview
with
hartmann
and
urged
that
some
warning
might
at
least
be
given
to
our
friends
by
all
means
he
remarked
warn
yours
to
keep
away
from
london
one
of
the
delegates
will
act
for
you
after
due
inspection
of
the
message
for
myself
i
have
already
taken
my
private
diary
dijon
and
the
river
saone
in
the
night
rising
rapidly
as
the
slopes
of
the
jura
mountains
are
ahead
of
us
and
the
captain
as
they
call
him
will
insist
on
keeping
high
no
doubt
it
is
safer
but
i
suspect
the
real
truth
is
that
he
wants
to
appear
unannounced
over
portent
as
mysterious
as
terrible
shows
himself
ironical
and
inflexible
i
suggest
a
mild
course
of
action
and
he
asks
me
whether
i
aspire
to
be
captain
of
the
am
becoming
nevertheless
almost
inured
to
the
thought
of
the
impending
calamity
brandt
says
philosophically
that
the
advance
of
man
is
always
over
unhappily
the
thorns
do
not
always
lead
to
happiness
will
they
do
so
in
this
case
the
bluster
of
the
vulgar
dynamitards
is
revolting
even
burnett
is
forgetting
the
end
in
the
means
as
to
schwartz
his
vile
parody
is
being
sung
freely
by
all
the
hyænas
of
his
stamp
the
dynamite
falls
on
castle
walls
and
splendid
buildings
old
in
story
the
column
shakes
the
tyrant
quakes
and
the
wild
wreckage
leaps
in
glory
throw
comrades
throw
set
the
wild
echoes
flying
throw
comrades
answer
wretches
dying
dying
am
getting
to
loathe
the
crew
now
the
novelty
of
their
reception
is
beginning
to
wear
off
afternoon
higher
great
discomfort
being
experienced
the
barometer
readings
make
us
three
and
a
half
miles
above
over
the
summits
of
the
jura
mountains
i
find
it
necessary
to
breathe
much
more
rapidly
the
rarity
of
the
air
is
unsatisfying
at
times
a
dizziness
seizes
me
and
on
examining
my
hands
and
body
i
find
my
veins
standing
out
like
whipcord
hartmann
shortly
eases
off
the
was
experimenting
so
it
appears
with
his
machinery
a
change
of
tactics
is
observable
he
ignores
possible
sightseers
now
probably
because
he
knows
that
reports
from
tourists
and
mountaineers
stand
no
chance
of
being
believed
hence
we
almost
brush
the
mountains
and
a
superb
privilege
it
is
the
magnificent
pines
here
surpass
anything
else
of
the
kind
sometimes
we
glide
midway
along
a
valley
with
a
rushing
torrent
beneath
us
and
these
precipices
on
our
sides
sometimes
we
amaze
a
luckless
mountaineer
or
shepherd
as
we
thread
a
defile
sometimes
we
curve
over
with
a
grace
an
eagle
might
imitate
then
again
we
breast
the
and
are
lost
in
its
mantling
fleeces
we
are
now
bearing
by
south
and
are
not
far
off
from
the
beautiful
lake
of
geneva
my
letter
and
telegram
and
gave
them
to
hartmann
for
the
delegate
we
have
stopped
over
a
pine
forest
some
five
miles
distant
from
morges
on
the
shore
of
the
lake
switzerland
i
am
told
was
selected
as
the
because
of
its
central
position
many
russians
poles
austrians
and
italians
besides
delegates
from
other
nationalities
are
expected
they
are
to
arrange
details
of
the
forthcoming
revolution
had
a
friendly
talk
with
burnett
who
once
more
tried
to
proselytize
me
told
him
if
any
one
could
shake
my
convictions
it
is
hartmann
and
not
he
how
bloodthirsty
the
men
are
getting
if
the
lust
for
blood
grows
by
what
it
feeds
on
what
if
this
crew
gets
out
of
hand
happily
a
strong
man
stands
at
the
helm
convention
is
in
full
swing
what
enthusiasm
must
inspire
these
tourists
for
of
course
it
is
in
this
character
that
they
travel
most
i
hear
are
very
badly
off
their
funds
being
supplied
by
their
associations
a
great
deal
of
provisions
and
has
been
brought
aboard
how
well
this
crusade
is
organized
hartmann
remains
on
board
he
has
never
left
the
vessel
except
on
the
occasion
when
he
visited
his
mother
burnett
and
schwartz
take
his
instructions
to
the
delegates
and
most
of
the
crew
escort
them
we
are
floating
very

of

of

excluded
but
learn
that
everything
has
gone
off
admirably
five
of
the
delegates
are
to
join
the
crew
the
rest
carry
back
their
instructions
we
start
early
in
the
morning
what
a
spectacle
there
is
before
us
however
two

breathing

is
something
trust
that
delegate
whoever
he
is
will
not
forget
the
telegram
and
letter
to
lena
chapter
ix
in
at
the
death
during
the
return
to
england
two
incidents
of
note
both
alike
terrible
but
terrible
in
widely
different
ways
chequered
our
voyage
and
the
first
of
these
it
will
now
be
my
task
to
detail
wealth
of
romance
witchery
of
mountain
scenery
and
panoramas
of
landscapes
in
the
happiness
can
be
gleaned
from
these
was
mine
in
bounteous
plenty
hitherto
however
the
had
met
with
gentle
winds
and
fairly
clear
skies
she
was
a
gay
butterfly
by
day
and
a
listless
moth
by
night
she
had
shortly
to
display
to
me
her
prowess
as
a
rider
of
the
tempest
this
experience
along
with
its
sequel
of
grim
incident
impressed
me
deeply
i
shall
try
to
awake
in
the
reader
some
echo
of
the
emotions
which
it
stirred
into
fervour
within
me
no
one
at
any
rate
could
charge
hartmann
with
boring
his
unsolicited
guest
feasted
as
i
had
been
with
pictures
i
was
destined
to
be
swept
through
ever
novel
galleries
of
natural
marvels
i
had
anticipated
that
we
should
return
by
a
like
route
to
that
by
which
we
had
arrived
but
a
pleasant
reversal
of
this
view
was
in
store
for
me
leaving
the
slopes
of
the
jura
behind
her
the
sped
in
a
southwesterly
direction
across
the
department
of
aisne
over
lyons
westward
across
the
extinct
volcanoes
of
auvergne
then
curving
slightly
to
the
south
she
leapt
the
river
dordogne
and
finally
passing
at
a
great
height
over
bordeaux
reached
the
ocean
rim
over
the
desolate
which
span
the
betwixt
the
garonne
estuary
and
the
adour
had
i
been
exploring
central
africa
in
the
interests
of
science
i
should
feel
justified
in
presenting
my
observations
at
length
but
the
tracts
beneath
me
being
so
familiar
such
procedure
would
be
both
useless
and
troublesome
i
must
therefore
leave
the
imaginative
to
put
themselves
in
my
place
and
picture
these
districts
as
transfigured
by
the
romance
of
in
looking
down
on
such
natural
maps
one
is
transported
with
a
sense
of
power
and
exultation
that
renders
even
homely
sights
attractive
burnett
it
is
true
assured
me
that
even
this
luxury
of
travel
palls
on
one
after
a
time
judging
from
the
indifference
of
the
crew
i
should
say
that
he
had
right
on
his
side
but
whether
my
artistic
appetite
was
abnormal
or
the
banquet
provided
was
not
of
the
proper
duration
i
can
only
say
that
this
part
of
my
residence
on
the
always
wore
the
livery
of
a
gorgeous
dream
it
was
becoming
dark
when
the
pine
forests
and
sand
wastes
of
the
gave
place
to
the
rim
of
biscay
surf
in
accordance
with
custom
we
rapidly
began
to
descend
and
were
soon
coursing
over
the
billows
at
a
height
of
some
feet
it
was
one
of
those
evenings
which
ordinarily
favour
melancholy
and
lassitude
above
us
stretched
inky
layers
of
stratus
or
fall
cloud
wrought
of
mists
driven
from
the
upper
regions
by
the
chills
that
hurried
after
the
setting
sun
the
wind
blew
in
gusts
and
preyed
on
our
electric
tension
of
the
atmosphere
was
becoming
unmistakably
manifest
clouds
were
rising
from
the
ocean
rim
and
mingling
with
the
flatter
masses
overhead
and
even
as
i
gazed
the
waves
seemed
to
flash
whiter
and
whiter
through
the
veil
of
the
nether
darkness
i
was
standing
on
the
upper
deck
debating
social
problems
with
brandt
greatly
to
the
enjoyment
of
three
of
the
crew
who
watched
the
contest
some
few
yards
in
front
of
us
the
platform
tapered
off
to
a
point
at
the
convergence
of
the
bow
railings
and
directly
in
front
of
this
the
hull
sloped
downwards
and
outwards
to
form
the
projecting
ram
at
the
extremity
of
this
with
crest
barely
visible
from
the
spot
where
my
listeners
were
reclining
rose
the
like
a
horn
on
the
snout
of
a
rhinoceros
amidships
and
astern
hummed
the
forest
of
stays
and
props
which
hung
us
to
the
aëroplane
clustering
thick
over
the
rounded
boss
of
the
citadel
now
half
shrouded
in
gloom
it
was
a
scene
to
inspire
the
weird
vessel
and
its
weird
crew
borne
along
between
an
angry
welkin
and
the
riotous
surges
of
the
ocean
violent
diseases
often
demand
violent
remedies
said
brandt
as
he
developed
his
favourite
topic
the
surgeon
may
be
gentle
at
heart
but
he
spares
not
the
gangrenous
limb
in
modern
times
he
has
anæsthetics
to
soothe
his
patient
but
did
he
shrink
from
his
task
when
such
artifices
as
these
were
unknown
regard
us
anarchists
as
excising
the
foul
ulcers
of
humanity
and
as
forced
to
perform
that
duty
with
no
anæsthetics
to
aid
us
could
we
throw
all
london
all
paris
all
berlin
into
a
trance
how
painless
would
be
our
surgery
but
unhappily
we
have
to
confront
struggling
patients
vividly
sensitive
to
the
knife
nevertheless
for
their
own
sakes
or
rather
the
sake
of
humanity
we
must
but
you
overlook
one
important
contrast
the
surgeon
lops
off
a
limb
or
roots
up
an
ulcer
to
save
his
patient
s
life
or
better
his
health
but
you
attack
civilization
not
to
reform
it
but
to
annihilate
that
is
true
but
industrial
is
it
not
a
system
to
be
identified
with
the
cause
of
human
welfare
and
hence
worth
preserving
in
some
form
or
other
at
all
costs
but
a
mere
vicious
outgrowth
prejudicial
to
that
welfare
as
we
conceive
it
the
test
of
the
worth
of
a
civilization
is
its
power
to
minister
to
human
happiness
judged
by
this
standard
your
civilization
has
proved
a
failure
mankind
rushed
to
her
embraces
in
hope
fought
its
way
thither
through
long
and
weary
centuries
and
has
for
a
reward
the
sneers
of
a
mistress
as
exacting
as
she
is
icy
the
third
day
comes
a
frost
a
killing
illustration
the
storm
gathering
during
the
delivery
of
this
harangue
the
wind
had
been
steadily
rising
and
it
now
began
to
shriek
through
the
stays
in
a
fashion
positively
alarming
foregoing
further
parley
i
bent
over
the
railing
and
strove
to
catch
a
glimpse
of
the
angry
beneath
us
but
it
was
by
this
time
too
dark
for
the
eye
glancing
upwards
and
around
the
horizon
i
could
see
the
awnings
of
the
storm
unrolling
with
here
and
there
a
rift
through
which
stole
the
feeble
moonlight
a
man
came
from
the
citadel
and
stepped
up
to
us
it
was
hartmann
well
he
said
we
are
in
for
it
the
barometer
is
falling
rapidly
and
the
storm
is
already
gathering
have
a
care
for
yourselves
comrades
he
added
to
his
followers
you
stanley
follow
me
to
the
the
log
of
the
may
be
worth
writing
i
followed
him
gladly
into
the
citadel
and
down
the
stair
leading
to
the
narrow
corridor
which
ran
on
to
the
bow
as
we
entered
it
the
seemed
to
reel
with
a
violent
shock
that
sent
me
spinning
against
the
wall
the
storm
had
burst
by
the
time
i
had
picked
myself
up
hartmann
had
disappeared
i
found
my
way
after
him
into
the
tower
where
he
was
standing
regulator
in
hand
with
his
eyes
on
the
glass
plate
that
looked
forward
into
the
night
we
are
rising
he
said
laconically
look
a
fan
of
vivid
glory
cleft
the
darkness
illumined
by
the
electric
great
masses
of
driving
vapour
were
rushing
by
us
but
other
sight
there
was
none
suddenly
a
second
squall
struck
us
and
the
rolled
like
a
liner
in
a
cyclone
the
lurch
was
horrible
and
for
a
moment
i
thought
we
were
must
have
been
one
of
at
least
degrees
followed
by
a
very
slow
recovery
hartmann
was
busy
over
a
medley
of
wheels
levers
and
regulators
we
are
passing
through
the
at
a
very
high
speed
he
continued
as
if
the
shock
was
a
trifle
my
intention
is
first
to
let
you
see
a
storm
from
the
quiet
zone
above
it
secondly
to
rush
downwards
into
it
that
the
may
show
her
i
said
nothing
for
my
feelings
were
in
truth
somewhat
mixed
with
the
ascent
portion
of
the
programme
i
concurred
heartily
the
second
i
would
gladly
have
abandoned
as
it
seemed
to
me
so
utterly
foolhardy
but
faint
heart
was
not
the
commodity
for
hartmann
and
wishing
to
earn
his
favour
through
his
respect
i
suppressed
my
fears
resolutely
not
noticing
my
silence
he
kept
on
throwing
in
his
comments
on
the
situation
as
the
minutes
wore
on
i
observed
that
the
mist
masses
were
blowing
thinner
and
thinner
against
the
bow
of
the
suddenly
the
electric
light
was
turned
off
and
a
gentle
silvery
glow
took
its
place
and
as
we
swept
on
i
perceived
that
the
wind
had
fallen
also
hartmann
pressed
a
and
the
two
men
on
watch
reappeared
illustration
amongst
the
now
to
the
deck
again
and
you
shall
see
a
fine
as
we
stepped
into
the
court
of
the
citadel
i
had
reason
to
appreciate
this
remark
down
in
the
i
had
stood
behind
the
captain
and
seen
little
save
the
dawn
of
a
gentle
radiance
among
the
thinning
mists
but
up
here
the
vista
was
glorious
a
brisk
but
by
no
means
stinging
wind
swept
the
deck
above
shone
the
horned
moon
in
unclouded
majesty
casting
a
weird
light
on
the
rolling
masses
of
underneath
us
from
below
came
the
roar
of
the
strife
of
elements
and
the
crooked
gleam
of
the
while
the
echoes
of
the
thunder
leapt
grimly
across
the
halls
and
palaces
of
the
as
if
arbiter
of
the
struggle
the
rode
serenely
over
the
turmoil
in
the
quiet
zone
how
high
are
we
now
i
asked
hartmann
for
the
air
was
oppressively
rare
a
trifle
over
two
miles
a
sublime
spectacle
this
is
it
not
uniquely
so
the
sense
of
serene
power
is
so
striking
but
you
do
not
propose
to
rest
here
oh
no
i
must
show
that
this
serene
power
is
not
fraudulent
i
shall
shortly
plunge
the
into
the
very
vortex
of
the
storm
and
teach
you
how
nobly
she
can
wing
her
way
through
it
would
not
be
safe
i
suppose
on
deck
what
with
the
rolling
pitching
and
wind
still
one
can
scarcely
enjoy
these
scenes
in
the
where
the
engineer
and
watchman
usurp
the
best
you
would
like
if
possible
to
stay
here
if
the
experience
had
to
be
undergone
there
was
no
reason
why
i
should
not
brave
it
out
thoroughly
better
the
deck
than
a
back
seat
in
the
well
so
let
it
be
but
you
must
be
lashed
securely
where
shall
it
be
why
not
to
the
railing
over
the
bow
you
could
not
have
a
finer
coigne
of
i
assented
at
once
and
a
couple
of
the
crew
being
hailed
i
was
speedily
made
fast
in
a
sitting
posture
by
the
waist
and
liberally
invested
with
wraps
my
position
was
excellent
i
could
see
down
the
sloping
bow
to
the
and
would
be
fairly
sheltered
from
the
worst
of
the
wind
all
the
preparations
being
complete
the
captain
and
the
crew
retired
leaving
the
deck
altogether
deserted
no
light
save
that
of
the
moon
fell
on
its
cold
surface
and
that
only
where
the
aëroplane
did
not
bar
off
the
sheets
of
slanting
silver
the
rode
grandly
over
the
gloomy
below
and
thrilling
with
excitement
and
some
fear
i
waited
for
the
coming
plunge
the
suspense
was
short
suddenly
the
electric
eye
of
the
aëronef
glowed
forth
from
the
crest
of
the
behind
and
above
which
i
was
lashed
to
the
railing
then
the
bow
dipped
and
the
speed
began
to
increase
again
and
again
it
dipped
with
a
series
of
little
jolts
and
then
cut
obliquely
into
the
tenuous
rim
of
the
through
which
it
began
to
plough
with
an
energy
almost
distressing
those
who
have
stood
on
an
express
engine
running
sixty
miles
an
hour
will
know
what
it
is
to
breathe
in
the
teeth
of
a
rushing
blast
let
them
then
conceive
my
experience
when
and
probably
more
miles
an
hour
were
being
done
in
a
hurricane
drenching
clouds
swept
over
me
the
wind
and
thunder
roared
round
me
as
i
was
borne
into
that
angry
stratum
below
burying
my
mouth
within
my
neckcloth
and
sheltering
my
eyes
with
my
hands
i
looked
straight
ahead
at
the
glow
which
cleft
the
darkness
before
us
in
a
very
brief
time
we
had
shot
through
the
belt
and
were
rushing
wildly
down
to
the
desolation
below
the
pitching
and
rolling
of
the
aëronef
now
became
terrible
and
once
more
awoke
my
fears
what
if
the
guns
were
to
break
adrift
or
the
props
of
the
aëroplane
to
yield
as
it
was
i
could
see
that
the
squalls
caused
a
startling
irregularity
of
course
the
swerving
furiously
from
right
to
left
now
dropping
like
a
stone
now
being
checked
in
her
descent
and
hurtled
upwards
surely
hartmann
would
not
run
too
close
to
the
waves
on
such
a
fearful
night
looking
downwards
i
now
saw
that
the
glow
had
reached
the
face
of
the
waters
everywhere
in
violent
turmoil
with
huge
waves
at
least
feet
high
from
trough
to
crest
spanned
by
clouds
of
and
sight
still
more
enthralling
was
a
large
dismasted
steamer
labouring
heavily
as
she
lay
under
the
strokes
of
a
thousand
hammers
with
boats
smashed
bridge
carried
away
bulwarks
in
many
places
shattered
and
decks
continually
swept
she
was
a
spectacle
fit
to
move
even
a
hartmann
assistance
however
was
out
of
the
question
every
art
of
the
captain
must
be
required
to
guide
the
course
of
the
and
our
tremendous
speed
could
not
safely
be
relaxed
for
a
moment
it
would
have
been
indeed
easy
to
hover
in
the
teeth
of
a
furious
blast
but
what
if
the
blast
were
to
drop
and
leave
us
momentarily
stationary
while
a
side
roll
or
pitch
were
to
succeed
illustration
sighting
a
doomed
vessel
screws
and
sand
levers
notwithstanding
it
was
better
to
risk
nothing
but
what
an
experience
was
this
the
with
flaming
electric
eye
circled
round
the
doomed
vessel
lighting
up
a
deck
crowded
with
passengers
groups
of
whom
every
larger
wave
washed
through
the
broken
bulwarks
cry
or
shriek
none
could
be
heard
the
roar
of
the
elements
was
too
frightful
but
the
gestures
of
the
wretches
were
too
piteous
to
misinterpret
shutting
my
eyes
i
refused
for
some
minutes
to
look
on
the
dreadful
holocaust
but
once
more
i
had
to
yield
to
the
fascination
by
that
time
the
drama
was
over
the
was
still
circling
but
in
the
place
of
the
luckless
vessel
leapt
the
savage
billows
i
now
began
to
feel
chilled
and
miserable
the
excitement
of
the
outset
had
dwindled
and
a
reaction
enhanced
by
the
rigours
of
the
night
and
the
foregoing
drama
mastered
me
happily
the
had
by
this
time
weathered
enough
of
difficulties
rising
through
the
she
left
the
angry
winds
and
rain
once
more
below
her
some
of
the
crew
ascended
to
the
deck
and
released
me
from
my
bondage
it
was
now
getting
late
so
after
thanking
hartmann
for
his
courtesy
i
descended
into
my
berth
to
sleep
off
the
ill
effects
of
exposure
and
dream
horrible
dreams
of
wrecks
and
drowning
victims
chapter
x
the
first
blow
i
rose
late
the
next
morning
somewhat
the
worse
for
my
exposure
but
nevertheless
far
too
interested
in
my
voyage
to
heed
a
mere
cold
and
a
few
rheumatic
twinges
no
sooner
indeed
was
i
awake
than
i
leapt
out
of
my
berth
and
busying
myself
energetically
with
my
toilet
was
speedily
pacing
the
bulwarked
passage
of
which
mention
has
already
been
made
the
zone
through
which
we
were
ploughing
was
cloudy
and
a
strong
bitter
head
wind
was
blowing
looking
over
the
bulwarks
i
could
see
nothing
but
driving
mists
and
above
the
vast
aëroplane
a
thinner
layer
of
mist
through
several
rifts
in
which
the
sun
thrust
his
slanting
columns
of
light
no
one
was
visible
in
the
passage
but
i
heard
a
medley
of
excited
voices
which
suggested
that
some
controversy
was
in
progress
on
the
upper
deck
listening
attentively
i
became
convinced
that
some
unusual
affair
was
in
hand
and
anxious
to
miss
nothing
of
interest
i
entered
an
arch
that
led
into
one
of
the
courts
and
passed
up
the
enclosed
spiral
staircase
to
the
scene
of
this
animated
talking
on
gaining
the
deck
i
saw
nearly
all
the
crew
standing
in
groups
round
the
citadel
burnett
was
there
gesticulating
wildly
to
brandt
so
stepping
briskly
up
to
them
i
asked
the
cause
of
this
muster
ah
you
here
said
burnett
in
time
for
the
first
blow
eh
well
there
will
be
something
to
see
shortly
eh
brandt
and
the
addressed
smiled
approvingly
but
his
merriment
recalled
the
bland
purring
of
a
cat
over
a
captured
mouse
what
s
up
then
i
continued
somewhat
startled
for
during
the
pause
the
ominous
words
ironclad
bombs
uttered
by
some
of
the
eager
disputants
around
had
caught
my
ear
the
captain
has
sighted
an
ironclad
and
we
are
about
to
try
conclusions
said
brandt
the
words
had
scarcely
passed
his
lips
when
the
inner
door
of
the
citadel
swung
ajar
and
through
the
enclosure
into
our
midst
stalked
the
redoubtable
captain
himself
comrades
he
said
below
us
steams
a
large
british
ironclad
just
sighted
through
the
mist
i
propose
to
test
her
will
serve
as
a
practical
test
of
our
you
agreeable
a
burst
of
applause
greeted
this
iniquitous
proposal
and
a
sturdy
rascal
stepped
out
of
the
throng
and
saluted
him
hartmann
bent
forward
well
norman
he
said
may
i
strike
the
first
blow
captain
a
chorus
of
similar
applications
followed
hartmann
thus
appealed
to
suggest
that
the
applicants
should
draw
lots
for
the
privilege
and
the
ruffians
proceeded
forthwith
to
settle
their
claims
in
this
fashion
their
levity
so
disgusted
me
that
i
longed
to
rush
forward
and
attack
the
whole
scheme
i
had
actually
moved
forward
some
steps
when
i
felt
a
tight
grip
on
my
arm
i
turned
round
sharply
to
face
brandt
who
had
providentially
sensed
my
project
back
man
are
you
mad
these
men
will
stand
no
nonsense
and
if
you
insult
the
captain
even
his
personal
influence
could
not
save
bah
it
was
hopeless
i
slunk
back
with
a
feeling
of
utter
helplessness
there
was
clearly
nothing
for
it
but
to
see
the
whole
hideous
affair
out
in
silence
still
indignation
all
but
mastered
me
what
ruffians
were
these
anarchists
cowards
i
hissed
involuntarily
but
by
this
time
they
were
too
absorbed
in
their
to
hear
me
shut
up
fool
reiterated
brandt
i
warn
you
that
you
will
be
brained
or
chucked
overboard
if
they
hear
i
bit
my
lips
in
despair
schwartz
has
it
schwartz
has
it
i
heard
hartmann
say
at
were
drawing
the
he
strikes
the
first
blow
and
no
better
man
could
do
it
next
norman
i
walked
away
and
leant
on
the
bow
railing
glad
to
be
left
alone
the
hubbub
continued
for
some
time
when
the
men
dispersed
almost
all
going
below
torn
by
useless
emotions
i
gazed
down
at
the
mists
that
swam
beneath
us
striving
to
pierce
the
veil
which
separated
us
from
the
doomed
ship
to
tear
myself
away
from
the
spot
was
fascination
of
the
projected
crime
was
irresistible
have
you
ever
watched
a
scene
in
a
loathing
it
while
nevertheless
unable
to
avert
your
gaze
possibly
you
have
well
that
situation
is
akin
to
the
morbid
curiosity
which
nailed
me
unwillingly
to
my
post
the
mists
were
thinning
around
us
but
i
observed
with
some
surprise
that
a
dense
cloud
below
off
sharply
from
its
now
unsubstantial
its
position
relatively
to
the
unchanged
evidently
hartmann
was
purposely
lurking
behind
this
barrier
and
proposed
to
deliver
his
first
blow
on
an
absolutely
unsuspecting
victim
looking
more
attentively
i
noted
a
thin
longitudinal
rift
in
this
cloud
through
which
could
be
seen
though
dimly
the
sea
and
in
this
something
dark
and
indistinct
no
bigger
than
an
ordinary
pea
it
was
the
ironclad
the
began
to
sink
rift
lengthened
and
broadened
as
i
gazed
the
pea
swelled
into
a
with
a
trail
of
black
smoke
faintly
decipherable
in
her
wake
down
down
down
we
were
now
on
the
fringe
of
the
upper
surface
of
the
cloud
and
the
great
ship
now
only
some
feet
below
us
was
revealing
itself
clearly
to
the
eye
at
this
point
our
downward
motion
ceased
and
the
began
to
describe
short
curves
at
the
level
of
the
screening
cloud
now
skimming
over
its
dank
masses
now
flashing
over
the
rift
that
stretched
directly
over
her
unsuspecting
prey
four
evolutions
of
this
sort
had
taken
place
and
now
for
the
fifth
time
we
were
gliding
over
the
rift
when
i
heard
a
cheer
raised
by
some
men
on
the
lower
gallery
and
craning
my
head
over
the
railing
saw
something
black
flash
through
space
and
splash
in
a
big
green
wave
that
was
flinging
itself
against
the
vessel
s
stern
it
was
the
moment
of
the
first
blow
the
omen
hold
good
first
blow
had
failed
again
a
curve
over
the
rift
and
once
more
a
failure
at
least
so
it
seemed
at
first
for
this
time
again
a
splash
by
the
stern
rejoiced
me
but
my
satisfaction
was
momentary
a
few
seconds
after
i
saw
a
cloud
of
smoke
shoot
upwards
from
the
ironclad
followed
by
a
deafening
crash
the
third
bomb
had
told
and
in
the
horrid
confusion
that
followed
the
threw
off
her
secrecy
slipped
through
the
cloud
and
floated
down
to
the
vessel
like
some
huge
bird
of
very
embodiment
of
masterful
and
shameless
power
as
the
smoke
cleared
away
revealing
the
strange
visitor
from
the
clouds
the
feelings
of
the
officers
and
crew
must
have
been
as
unique
as
they
were
terrible
amazement
a
sense
of
complete
unpreparedness
and
helplessness
going
along
with
the
disastrous
results
of
the
explosion
must
have
unnerved
even
the
boldest
the
great
was
wholly
at
the
mercy
of
the
foe
that
rode
so
contemptuously
above
it
illustration
the
at
the
attila
s
mercy
how
the
situation
was
viewed
from
its
decks
has
been
told
at
length
in
the
admirably
graphic
letter
of
captain
boyes
to
the
and
to
that
source
i
must
refer
you
for
details
looking
down
from
my
eyrie
i
was
of
course
only
able
to
gauge
very
roughly
the
havoc
wrought
by
the
bomb
hartmann
had
previously
told
me
that
nothing
constructed
by
man
could
withstand
his
enormous
missiles
and
the
scene
below
well
bore
out
his
boast
apparently
the
bomb
had
burst
amidships
nearly
i
should
say
between
the
funnels
of
these
latter
one
had
been
shorn
of
half
its
length
the
other
had
been
blown
away
completely
its
base
forming
part
of
a
chasm
whence
rolled
volumes
of
black
smoke
through
which
the
shrieks
of
wounded
men
rose
faintly
upward
across
this
chasm
had
fallen
the
while
fragments
of
spars
ventilators
steel
plates
fittings
boats
and
human
victims
were
scattered
confusedly
over
the
and
even
as
i
looked
two
more
appalling
explosions
shook
the
ironclad
from
stem
to
stern
through
the
uprush
of
smoke
i
saw
a
great
telescope
of
a
gun
tossed
out
of
its
shattered
turret
into
the
water
and
a
huge
cantle
of
the
steel
deck
torn
away
as
if
it
were
paper
exposing
a
new
chasm
at
once
invaded
by
flames
but
the
other
bomb
was
even
more
deadly
bursting
in
the
great
hollow
excavated
between
the
funnels
and
wrecking
the
very
vitals
of
the
ironclad
the
steam
from
the
shattered
boilers
rushing
tumultuously
up
the
gap
with
the
effect
of
speedily
shrouding
the
whole
vessel
some
horrible
deaths
says
captain
boyes
sprang
from
this
explosion
as
all
those
on
duty
in
the
port
and
were
either
blown
to
pieces
by
the
bomb
or
subsequently
boiled
alive
i
did
not
of
course
know
of
this
at
the
time
but
the
volumes
of
escaping
steam
told
too
clearly
how
hideous
must
be
the
massacre
and
imagination
thus
stimulated
could
not
very
well
go
far
wrong
i
felt
giddy
with
horror
when
i
thought
of
the
scenes
which
that
hung
over
how
long
was
this
drama
to
continue
doubtless
until
the
ironclad
was
gutted
or
sunk
a
consummation
which
could
not
be
very
far
distant
two
or
three
bombs
more
would
surely
complete
the
work
and
leave
perhaps
no
witness
to
tell
the
hideous
tale
to
history
i
could
look
no
do
so
seemed
almost
abetting
these
cruel
flinging
myself
on
the
deck
awaited
tremblingly
the
next
burst
of
thunder
a
minute
ebbed
away
another
and
then
another
and
still
no
shock
the
suspense
was
becoming
acute
suddenly
the
pitched
violently
the
bow
shifting
thrice
vehemently
upwards
and
along
with
this
the
hum
of
the
great
began
to
swell
higher
and
higher
i
sprang
to
my
tactics
meant
of
course
a
rapid
ascent
but
what
was
the
object
in
view
glancing
over
the
railing
i
perceived
that
we
were
slanting
at
great
speed
into
the
leaving
the
crippled
far
behind
and
below
ah
yes
the
reason
was
clear
enough
not
a
mile
to
the
a
large
ironclad
attended
by
some
smaller
vessels
probably
cruisers
was
making
its
way
to
the
scene
owing
to
my
absorption
in
the
attack
they
had
hitherto
escaped
my
notice
a
poor
job
this
said
some
one
who
had
stolen
up
unperceived
behind
me
i
turned
was
burnett
very
i
answered
i
must
congratulate
you
i
suppose
on
the
heroism
you
have
just
displayed
a
pity
not
to
enhance
it
by
engaging
this
vessel
s
burnett
took
the
sneer
coolly
why
waste
material
besides
you
must
see
that
the
would
be
uselessly
exposing
herself
it
would
be
folly
to
risk
the
salute
of
heavy
guns
with
the
great
campaign
yet
before
he
was
wise
after
his
kind
the
dared
not
face
the
who
by
elevating
their
guns
might
well
succeed
in
winging
her
a
shell
from
a
gun
would
have
proved
a
most
damaging
visitor
only
so
long
as
she
circled
directly
above
a
vessel
could
she
count
on
immunity
from
serious
injury
a
contest
at
her
old
level
with
numerous
foes
was
impracticable
so
huge
a
target
would
inevitably
be
holed
in
the
long
run
while
an
attempt
to
drop
bombs
from
a
higher
level
would
defeat
its
object
by
rendering
accuracy
of
aim
impracticable
perforce
then
she
had
dropped
the
prey
from
her
talons
and
was
seeking
safety
aloft
mounting
into
she
was
departing
as
mysteriously
as
she
had
come
a
tigress
who
having
once
tasted
blood
yearned
to
slake
her
thirst
in
the
heart
of
civilization
itself
we
were
to
reach
the
metropolis
and
sick
with
my
forebodings
and
savage
at
my
sense
of
impotence
i
turned
surlily
away
from
burnett
whose
very
presence
was
now
becoming
obnoxious
and
descending
into
a
court
passed
thence
through
the
gallery
to
my
berth
resolved
from
that
hour
to
see
as
little
of
my
fell
associates
as
the
conditions
of
my
stay
rendered
possible
chapter
xi
a
tempest
of
dynamite
on
the
morning
of
october
that
most
memorable
of
days
in
the
history
of
revolutions
we
sighted
brighton
through
the
haze
and
secrecy
being
no
longer
observed
the
swept
down
like
an
albatross
into
the
sight
of
men
gliding
two
hundred
feet
above
the
water
she
presented
a
truly
majestic
spectacle
the
vast
sweep
of
her
aëroplane
the
huge
size
of
her
silvery
grey
hull
the
play
of
the
three
great
screws
humming
with
the
speed
of
their
rotation
the
aëronauts
lining
the
upper
deck
and
lower
gallery
the
nozzle
horned
with
its
quaint
and
the
four
ominous
cannon
leaning
downwards
from
the
citadel
these
and
the
marvellous
flight
itself
commanded
the
homage
that
hailed
her
the
esplanade
and
the
beach
buzzed
with
wonder
beneath
us
and
as
we
skimmed
over
the
beyond
them
streets
seemed
to
fill
as
if
by
magic
thunders
of
applause
rose
behind
us
as
awe
regularly
gave
place
to
admiration
they
will
sound
a
different
note
said
schwartz
who
was
standing
by
me
the
banquet
at
last
is
ready
and
surely
we
shall
eat
till
we
are
the
gradually
rose
higher
as
the
slopes
of
the
south
downs
confronted
her
but
she
always
kept
about
one
hundred
and
fifty
feet
from
the
ground
deliberately
courting
the
observation
which
she
had
once
so
shunned
of
her
purpose
or
ownership
no
sign
however
was
given
it
was
pleasant
to
play
with
the
unsuspicious
fools
whose
lives
and
possessions
she
had
so
ruthlessly
marked
for
her
own
a
more
fascinating
sight
than
this
journey
it
is
not
easy
to
picture
now
for
the
first
time
in
my
life
i
fairly
revelled
in
the
incense
of
my
astonishment
to
dance
over
woods
fields
hills
and
sinuous
rivers
to
grasp
vast
vistas
of
scenery
are
in
themselves
delicious
but
when
to
these
purely
artistic
joys
are
added
those
of
power
when
the
roar
of
wondering
cities
rises
upwards
and
you
lean
over
the
bulwarks
serenely
conscious
of
superiority
you
must
be
described
as
realizing
here
on
earth
one
of
the
paradises
of
dreamland
at
about
ten
o
clock
we
passed
over
grinstead
and
shortly
afterwards
crossed
the
boundaries
of
sussex
by
this
time
the
preparations
on
the
aëronef
were
complete
and
every
one
had
been
summoned
to
the
citadel
and
told
off
to
his
post
and
now
there
fell
upon
me
the
shadow
of
the
coming
disaster
the
faces
of
the
crew
were
savage
even
brandt
had
lost
his
kindliness
burnett
was
surly
and
asked
how
i
liked
my
position
rather
nettled
i
told
him
that
at
any
rate
my
hands
would
be
free
from
then
it
occurred
to
me
that
i
might
glean
some
interesting
news
from
hartmann
eager
for
some
excitement
as
the
depression
stole
heavier
and
heavier
upon
me
i
ascended
to
the
upper
deck
and
pressed
the
button
by
the
gate
of
the
sombre
citadel
thomas
appeared
and
telephoned
my
request
to
see
the
captain
the
reply
came
back
that
he
was
in
the
but
would
be
glad
to
see
me
for
a
moment
accordingly
i
was
not
long
in
making
my
way
along
the
passage
that
led
from
the
citadel
to
that
favoured
spot
well
he
said
i
trust
your
nerves
are
in
order
the
drama
opens
in
an
hour
within
three
days
time
london
will
be
in
ruins
and
lord
macaulay
s
new
zealander
will
be
able
to
commence
his
is
there
no
way
of
avoiding
it
in
the
name
of
humanity
captain
i
beseech
you
to
pause
think
of
the
agonies
which
this
awful
resolve
must
breed
no
more
of
this
he
said
sharply
you
are
my
guest
you
may
if
you
wish
be
landed
you
may
if
you
wish
remain
but
in
the
latter
case
you
will
conform
to
my
and
that
is
that
you
hold
your
tongue
when
desired
to
london
i
say
as
cato
said
of
carthage
london
must
be
you
have
the
advantage
captain
but
thank
heaven
this
will
be
no
catastrophe
of
my
making
and
now
may
i
ask
a
rather
leading
question
by
all
means
at
the
worst
you
can
only
be
refused
an
when
and
how
will
the
first
blow
be
struck
above
the
houses
of
parliament
a
blank
discharge
of
the
cannon
will
warn
all
after
which
my
flag
will
be
run
out
and
i
understood
we

this

you
are
free
to
walk
the
upper

but
the
lower
gallery
is
being
transformed
into
tanks
to
hold
the

i
must
now
ask
you
to
go

you
will
see

place
him
under

is

he
must
interfere

with
nothing
either
by

or

any
breach
of

entail
i
was
as
helpless
as
a
bluebottle
in
a
spider
s
web
thank
heavens
that
i
had
sent
lena
that
telegram
and
letter
luckily
in
any
case
she
and
her
parents
ought
to
receive
warning
from
the
guarded
hints
doubtless
already
conveyed
to
hartmann
when
i
reached
the
deck
thomas
who
acted
as
a
sort
of
told
off
a
man
to
watch
me
and
then
sped
away
below
looking
over
the
rail
i
could
see
that
the
oil
was
being
poured
into
tanks
formed
by
fitting
cross
walls
into
parts
of
the
lower
gallery
there
were
some
eight
of
these
along
the
bow
end
of
the
vessel
alone
and
i
trembled
to
think
of
the
fearful
mischief
which
these
hideous
contrivances
portended
lamentations
of
this
sort
were
however
futile
casting
an
eye
over
the
landscape
i
saw
caterham
vanishing
beneath
us
while
to
the
right
rolled
the
billowy
expanse
of
the
north
downs
we
were
now
going
at
a
high
speed
and
in
a
short
too
short
to
my
rapidly
skimming
over
croydon
norwood
junction
and
the
crystal
palace
we
were
now
nearing
our
destination
and
our
altitude
recently
raised
to
one
of
five
hundred
and
fifty
feet
above
was
once
again
suddenly
altered
to
one
of
one
hundred
and
fifty
the
speed
too
was
rapidly
reduced
till
at
last
gliding
gracefully
over
lambeth
we
passed
obliquely
over
westminster
bridge
the
scene
here
beggars
description
the
enormous
crowd
already
massed
for
some
great
labour
demonstration
usurped
every
available
patch
of
standing
room
windows
and
roofs
became
animated
and
vehicles
of
all
sorts
and
conditions
pulled
up
in
batches
and
served
as
the
of
excited
groups
probably
the
arrival
at
brighton
had
been
at
once
telegraphed
to
the
newspaper
offices
but
few
knew
of
it
and
to
those
few
the
anarchist
brothers
apart
the
was
necessarily
a
complete
mystery
to
the
majority
we
came
as
falls
a
bolt
from
the
blue
i
refer
here
to
the
universal
astonishment
apparent
for
at
the
outset
it
was
clear
enough
that
the
aëronef
inspired
no
terror
cheers
shook
the
air
beneath
us
and
the
distant
thunders
of
applause
rumbled
far
away
down
the
embankment
a
man
stepped
aside
from
his
gun
and
pointed
down
at
the
crowd
on
westminster
bridge
this
is
the
bridge
blown
up
by
hartmann
and
schwartz
ten
years
ago
these
vermin
seem
to
have
liked
it
don
t
they
i
turned
away
in
disgust
what
a
mockery
it
was
the
populace
thought
they
were
applauding
an
inventor
and
they
cheered
a
ruthless
destroyer
terrible
captain
te
but
the
hour
had
rose
only
twenty
yards
from
us
suddenly
a
gong
sounded
ominously
it
was
the
signal
the
four
guns
vomited
flame
simultaneously
and
ere
the
crash
had
died
away
a
flag
was
to
be
seen
fluttering
at
the
stern
the
crew
yelled
with
excitement
as
well
they
might
for
the
was
evilly
romantic
on
its
broad
fluttering
bosom
the
flag
bore
five
ominous
which
carried
a
terrible
commentary
with
thus
returns
hartmann
the
anarchist
it
was
a
shock
never
to
be
forgotten
the
cheering
ceased
in
an
instant
and
in
its
place
curses
and
howls
rose
up
from
the
struggling
mob
even
the
sightseers
on
the
roofs
shook
their
fists
at
the
ah
vermin
yelled
one
of
the
crew
you
will
howl
louder
the
words
had
scarcely
left
his
lips
when
the
was
sharply
propelled
onwards
the
force
being
such
as
to
cause
me
to
grasp
the
railing
to
save
myself
from
falling
the
object
of
this
manœuvre
was
evident
it
was
necessary
to
rise
now
that
we
were
recognized
and
active
operations
were
to
commence
after
a
series
of
brilliant
wheels
the
climbed
high
above
the
and
commenced
to
cruise
about
in
large
circles
the
gong
sounded
once
more
once
more
the
guns
vomited
flame
and
this
time
the
charge
was
not
blank
and
mingling
with
their
almost
continuous
roar
there
now
came
a
crash
of
appalling
magnitude
shaking
the
very
recesses
of
one
s
brain
another
and
another
followed
till
the
air
seemed
to
beat
in
waves
upon
us
and
our
ears
became
veritable
then
followed
a
rattle
like
that
of
a
landslip
i
looked
over
to
start
back
with
a
shriek
horror
of
horrors
the
great
tower
had
fallen
on
the
crowd
bruising
into
jelly
a
legion
of
buried
wretches
and
beating
into
ruins
the
whole
mass
of
buildings
opposite
every
outlet
from
the
neighbourhood
was
being
furiously
fought
for
hordes
of
screaming
shrieking
madmen
were
falling
crushing
and
stamping
their
victims
into
heaps
and
with
the
growth
of
each
writhing
heap
the
ghastly
confusion
grew
also
of
the
houses
of
parliament
pinnacles
were
collapsing
and
walls
were
being
riven
asunder
as
the
shells
burst
within
them
illustration
thus
returns
hartmann
the
but
this
spectacle
grievous
of
its
kind
was
as
nothing
to
the
other
with
eyes
riveted
now
to
the
massacre
i
saw
frantic
women
trodden
down
by
men
huge
clearings
made
by
the
shells
and
instantly
filled
up
crushing
horses
and
vehicles
as
they
fell
fires
bursting
out
on
all
sides
to
devour
what
they
listed
and
terrified
police
struggling
wildly
and
helplessly
in
the
heart
of
the
press
the
roar
of
the
guns
was
continuous
and
every
missile
found
its
billet
was
i
in
pandemonium
i
saw
burnett
black
with
grime
hounding
his
comrades
on
to
the
slaughter
i
heard
the
roar
of
schwartz
s
bombs
and
the
roar
of
the
burning
and
falling
houses
huge
circles
of
flame
raved
beneath
us
and
shot
up
their
feverish
and
scorching
breath
the
drunk
with
slaughter
was
careering
in
continually
fresh
tracts
spreading
havoc
and
desolation
everywhere
to
compare
her
to
a
wolf
in
a
flock
of
helpless
sheep
is
sheep
could
at
least
butt
the
victims
below
could
not
approach
and
after
some
time
indeed
owing
to
the
smoke
could
not
even
see
us
the
morning
passed
in
horror
but
the
story
of
the
afternoon
and
evening
is
wilder
yet
the
sky
overcast
with
clouds
and
black
with
uprolling
lay
like
a
strangely
spotted
pall
over
the
blazing
district
around
and
within
westminster
enmity
could
do
no
more
shortly
before
two
o
clock
the
drew
off
with
the
screws
working
powerfully
she
climbed
upwards
into
the
heavens
and
buried
in
the
gave
london
a
momentary
respite
hartmann
wished
not
to
fatigue
the
crew
being
anxious
to
reserve
their
energies
for
the
attack
on
the
city
his
aim
was
to
pierce
the
ventricle
of
the
heart
of
civilization
that
heart
which
pumps
the
blood
of
capital
everywhere
through
the
arteries
of
russia
of
australia
of
india
just
as
through
the
capillaries
of
fur
companies
in
north
america
planting
enterprises
in
ecuador
and
trading
steamers
on
african
rivers
paralyze
this
heart
he
has
said
and
you
paralyze
credit
and
the
mechanism
of
finance
almost
the
result
already
known
to
history
proved
too
well
that
he
was
right
but
my
task
is
not
to
play
the
historian
but
simply
to
tell
my
tale
as
one
who
has
trod
the
the
interval
of
respite
was
not
long
but
during
the
whole
time
we
kept
well
veiled
within
the
angry
zone
of
clouds
burnett
came
up
to
speak
to
me
but
i
received
him
coldly
enough
schwartz
was
surprised
that
i
had
no
compliment
for
him
when
even
the
captain
was
pleased
he
remarked
that
the
slaughter
had
been
prodigious
that
the
houses
of
parliament
were
wrecked
and
the
flames
were
carrying
everything
before
them
nero
fiddling
over
rome
was
respectable
compared
with
this
monster
but
to
attack
him
would
have
been
fatal
as
i
should
have
at
once
been
shot
or
thrown
overboard
hartmann
remained
invisible
he
was
still
at
his
post
in
the
towards
three
o
clock
i
noticed
the
men
hurrying
hastily
to
their
posts
the
assault
was
shortly
to
begin
slowly
we
emerged
from
the
wheeling
ever
in
great
circles
above
the
luckless
quarry
below
a
queer
accident
delayed
us
i
was
standing
by
the
citadel
when
i
heard
a
sharp
crack
followed
by
a
sensation
of
rapid
sinking
the
shaft
of
the
main
screw
had
broken
and
we
were
rushing
downwards
like
a
parachute
everything
for
the
moment
was
in
confusion
and
more
than
one
cheek
paled
but
a
was
in
the
without
even
handling
the
sand
levers
hartmann
set
the
auxiliary
screws
rotating
at
a
high
speed
at
once
the
fall
was
checked
and
the
rose
once
more
into
the
clouds
after
an
hour
s
delay
the
shaft
was
temporarily
repaired
and
arrangements
were
made
to
replace
it
if
necessary
with
a
spare
one
luckily
for
the
aëronef
these
shafts
were
extremely
short
so
that
two
spare
ones
could
always
be
kept
in
hand
without
undue
demand
for
stowage
room
the
present
mishap
was
not
at
all
serious
as
between
the
repaired
shaft
and
the
spare
ones
there
was
little
if
anything
to
choose
the
only
lucky
thing
was
that
the
snap
had
not
taken
place
too
close
to
the
stern
in
this
case
the
might
have
torn
away
the
and
irretrievably
damaged
themselves
at
the
same
time
the
now
began
to
working
all
three
screws
at
once
we
were
evidently
not
unexpected
for
i
made
out
soldiery
in
the
streets
and
several
detachments
of
artillery
how
they
expected
to
wing
us
i
really
do
not
know
for
a
moving
aëronef
hurling
forcite
and
dynamite
missiles
is
neither
an
easy
nor
a
pleasant
target
the
height
at
which
we
were
must
also
be
borne
in
mind
i
suppose
i
am
within
the
mark
when
i
say
that
our
descent
stopped
at
the
limit
there
was
no
delay
this
time
the
first
and
second
bombs
fell
on
the
tower
reducing
it
half
to
ruins
they
were
of
the
largest
kind
and
terribly
effective
instruments
meanwhile
the
guns
played
havoc
at
all
points
of
the
compass
but
the
worst
was
to
come
as
we
rode
over
the
heart
of
the
sanctum
of
capital
where
the
bank
of
england
many
other
banks
of
scarcely
less
brilliant
fame
the
royal
exchange
stock
exchange
with
credit
companies
insurance
offices
and
discount
houses
innumerable
lie
bombs
fell
in
a
tempest
shattering
fabric
after
fabric
and
uprooting
their
very
foundations
there
was
a
constant
roar
of
explosions
and
the
loss
of
life
must
have
been
something
terrible
burnett
was
in
his
element
handling
his
gun
like
a
practised
marksman
he
riddled
paul
s
and
its
neighbourhood
the
crash
of
the
infalling
dome
rising
even
above
the
explosions
around
it
but
for
him
at
least
there
was
retribution
hitherto
bating
we
had
escaped
being
hit
the
motion
and
height
of
the
were
in
our
favour
south
london
enjoyed
the
downfall
of
the
shells
launched
against
us
but
as
fate
would
have
it
a
volley
of
struck
us
from
the
sides
of
the
aëronef
they
rebounded
steel
armour
would
have
been
more
easily
pierced
but
a
stray
one
found
a
billet
burnett
was
gazing
over
the
side
through
the
smoke
at
the
wreckage
when
a
ball
holed
his
throat
he
fell
back
with
a
gurgle
i
ran
up
and
saw
the
man
was
blood
was
spurting
from
his
carotid
like
jets
from
a
siphon
in
less
than
a
minute
he
was
dead
his
fate
was
deserved
and
i
felt
no
ray
of
sympathy
for
by
this
time
i
was
dead
to
all
feelings
except
those
of
helpless
hatred
for
the
anarchists
and
horror
at
the
hideous
slaughter
below
before
this
horror
every
former
sympathy
with
hartmann
and
his
crew
had
withered
could
i
have
killed
hartmann
at
that
moment
i
would
gladly
have
paid
the
price
for
it
but
his
day
of
reckoning
was
to
come
illustration
the
death
of
burnett
chapter
xii
how
i
left
the
the
death
of
burnett
drove
the
crew
to
frenzy
their
curses
were
not
those
of
men
but
of
fiends
the
shock
of
fury
that
one
blow
of
their
despised
victims
should
have
them
into
the
mood
of
molochs
instantly
the
news
flew
to
hartmann
who
returned
a
welcome
answer
the
yells
around
me
were
broken
by
a
burst
of
laughter
what
is
it
i
asked
fearful
of
some
new
horror
full
as
the
measure
of
crime
now
seemed
wait
and
you
will
see
was
all
the
reply
i
got
the
began
to
move
at
a
high
speed
and
four
of
the
men
rushed
down
on
to
the
lower
deck
quicker
quicker
quicker
was
no
doubt
of
it
we
were
swooping
on
the
city
like
a
falcon
i
was
at
the
rail
in
a
moment
and
careless
of
uprushing
shot
and
shell
bent
over
the
side
in
a
fever
though
beyond
the
zone
of
flames
a
simoom
blast
swept
the
vessel
and
puffs
of
inky
smoke
spangled
with
sparks
rendered
breathing
a
torment
but
the
swerved
not
an
iota
down
we
swept
like
a
hurricane
over
the
yelling
maddened
throngs
massed
in
farringdon
street
suddenly
i
heard
a
sharp
cry
stand
off
i
had
hardly
time
to
draw
back
when
a
column
of
flames
shot
up
the
side
reddening
the
very
bar
i
had
been
clutching
let
go
crash
the
column
vanished
and
a
stream
of
fire
like
a
comet
s
tail
drew
out
instantaneously
in
the
wake
of
the
it
was
the
petroleum
the
first
tank
had
been
lighted
its
contents
shot
over
the
shrieking
wretches
below
for
full
fifty
to
sixty
yards
the
blaze
filled
the
roadway
and
the
mob
lapped
in
flame
were
writhing
and
wrestling
within
it
a
fiendish
revenge
was
glutted
suddenly
i
was
hurled
violently
to
the
deck
as
the
bow
rose
sharply
the
buoyed
by
her
aëroplane
shot
once
more
aslant
to
her
old
higher
level
firing
her
guns
continuously
as
she
ascended
sick
and
surfeited
with
horror
i
remained
lying
some
time
where
i
was
but
the
end
was
yet
to
come
illustration
pouring
down
liquid
fire
by
this
time
the
night
was
pressing
on
rapidly
but
what
a
night
i
rose
up
and
staggered
to
the
to
be
away
from
these
wretches
the
hum
of
the
great
reached
me
and
i
looked
over
and
yearned
that
they
might
fail
us
we
were
now
circling
over
fleet
street
and
the
neighbourhood
of
the
strand
the
fires
lighted
at
westminster
in
the
morning
were
carrying
all
before
them
and
a
crimson
yellow
rim
stretched
all
the
way
from
whitehall
to
victoria
on
our
flank
the
city
was
blazing
and
a
roaring
tumult
of
flames
was
undulating
in
every
direction
from
this
centre
and
now
for
the
first
time
i
saw
that
others
than
ourselves
were
hurrying
on
the
incendiary
work
below
there
were
visible
blazing
circles
in
south
london
over
the
water
blazing
circles
far
away
in
north
london
and
blazing
circles
scattered
throughout
the
west
end
the
delegates
had
kept
their
faith
the
great
metropolis
seemed
doomed
i
shuddered
to
think
what
the
mob
might
do
in
their
despair
the
west
end
was
even
now
probably
being
looted
and
the
worst
passions
would
toll
its
i
thought
of
my
telegram
and
found
some
relief
in
the
belief
that
lena
at
least
was
out
of
danger
suddenly
i
shook
with
terror
i
had
never
asked
hartmann
whether
the
letter
and
the
telegram
form
had
been
handed
to
the
delegate
racing
back
to
the
citadel
i
appealed
to
one
of
my
guards
could
a
message
be
sent
to
the
captain
certainly
the
reply
came
back
in
about
ten
minutes
it
was
to
the
effect
that
they
had
been
handed
to
burnett
for
one
of
the
french
delegates
had
burnett
then
given
them
it
was
just
possible
that
he
had
not
kneeling
by
the
body
i
ransacked
the
dead
man
s
pockets
my
worst
fears
were
realized
in
the
of
his
coat
lay
the
precious
and
forgotten
missives
my
heart
seemed
to
stop
for
the
moment
and
then
beat
with
hammer
strokes
i
made
a
desperate
resolution
i
must
see
hartmann
at
all
costs
and
wring
from
him
the
permit
and
opportunity
to
descend
doubtless
it
was
entering
the
shambles
of
a
desperate
city
now
being
wrecked
and
pillaged
by
its
own
inhabitants
it
was
entering
the
lion
s
den
possibly
only
to
find
a
victim
before
becoming
one
myself
but
whatever
risks
i
ran
honour
scoffed
at
delay
and
love
winged
me
with
ardour
tell
the
captain
i
must
see
him
tell
him
the
letter
was
never
delivered
and
that
i
must
somehow
find
a
means
of
speaking
to
him
face
to
the
answer
came
that
he
could
not
possibly
see
me
and
that
i
must
say
through
the
telephone
what
i
wanted
and
that
briefly
i
shouted
that
i
must
at
all
costs
descend
he
replied
that
his
plans
were
unalterable
i
entreated
i
clamoured
i
expostulated
pleading
the
friendship
i
had
borne
to
his
mother
and
the
possibility
that
she
too
had
not
yet
stirred
his
words
to
her
had
necessarily
been
more
or
less
enigmatical
let
me
then
go
and
watch
over
the
fate
of
her
also
i
had
moved
him
for
there
was
a
long
pause
after
what
seemed
ages
of
waiting
came
his
reply
the
can
not
descend
but
it
crosses
hyde
park
shortly
if
the
case
is
urgent
take
my
parachute
the
fall
will
not
be
of
more
than
five
or
six
hundred
this
alternative
was
gruesome
but
there
was
no
help
for
it
i
wavered
an
instant
and
accepted
shortly
afterwards
norris
appeared
on
deck
and
bade
me
follow
him
into
the
citadel
i
entered
it
crouching
low
down
to
the
deck
with
the
fire
of
the
guns
darting
forth
above
me
and
down
the
steep
stair
we
went
till
we
reached
the
door
of
the
dynamite
room
my
guide
pushed
the
door
open
and
we
entered
a
solitary
electric
lamp
dispelled
the
gloom
of
the
chamber
and
revealed
the
figures
of
schwartz
and
two
other
men
standing
by
the
now
for
the
moment
closed
i
was
struck
with
the
caution
with
which
their
work
judging
from
appearances
was
done
from
a
cabinet
in
the
corner
sloped
a
tube
of
network
well
stayed
by
bands
and
roping
to
the
ceiling
it
was
evidently
along
this
that
the
dangerous
bombs
were
guided
rolling
into
a
compartment
immediately
over
the
trap
i
had
scarcely
entered
when
the
trap
was
lifted
the
compartment
lowered
its
terrible
passenger
released
and
the
bag
sharply
pulled
in
to
forego
a
glance
was
impossible
i
leant
over
the
aperture
and
listened
for
the
voice
of
the
fatal
messenger
it
exploded
near
oxford
street
below
us
apparently
in
a
house
for
the
secondary
rattle
was
tremendous
suggesting
the
crash
of
ruined
walls
on
the
roadway
schwartz
was
about
to
launch
another
when
a
ting
of
the
arrested
him
he
telephoned
to
hartmann
and
received
the
order
to
cease
dropping
bombs
for
the
present
the
reason
was
simple
enough
they
were
about
to
utilize
a
new
weapon
the
petroleum
which
up
to
this
time
had
done
duty
only
on
the
hideous
occasion
already
mentioned
norris
now
stepped
up
to
schwartz
and
told
him
of
my
determination
the
german
s
wicked
eyes
twinkled
good
i
too
descend
and
we
may
better
luck
i
said
bitterly
i
have
done
with
the
for
so
ah
you
socialists
have
much
to
learn
well
we
are
teaching
you
something
in
i
managed
to
keep
my
temper
for
these
were
not
men
to
be
played
with
but
how
i
would
have
liked
to
have
hurled
the
miscreant
down
that
norris
muttered
that
the
mob
might
teach
me
something
too
and
i
realized
then
that
the
descent
was
not
my
greatest
danger
what
if
the
parachute
were
to
be
seen
by
any
one
i
should
be
torn
to
pieces
or
worse
the
possibility
was
an
appalling
one
still
the
darkness
would
prove
a
very
serviceable
shield
once
clear
of
the
park
i
could
pilot
myself
through
the
streets
without
trouble
here
the
captain
sent
you
this
revolver
you
may
need
it
to
defend
yourself
not
that
i
care
a
cent
and
now
look
sharp
we
are
coming
over
park
lane
in
a
norris
pointed
to
the
and
i
saw
swinging
at
the
side
a
long
what
climb
down
that
yes
if
you
want
to
go
there
s
no
other
good
enough
come
yes
or
no
we
shall
be
spinning
across
the
park
before
you
ve
done
but
the
parachute
there
it
is
in
the
corner
it
is
a
case
of
clinging
on
with
your
hands
we
will
lower
it
to
you
and
at
the
word
go
drop
it
the
only
risk
is
trees
and
the
cursed
vermin
underneath
will
you
go
there
was
no
help
for
it
i
clenched
my
teeth
savagely
and
backed
kneeling
on
to
the
edge
of
the
grasping
the
with
my
left
hand
to
steady
myself
schwartz
and
another
man
got
ready
the
parachute
and
thrust
its
stem
down
the
opening
it
was
lucky
the
did
not
pitch
for
these
tactics
might
have
proved
my
as
it
was
i
succeeded
in
working
my
toes
into
the
top
and
thence
into
the
lower
rungs
of
the
ladder
having
thus
worked
my
way
down
i
looked
for
the
parachute
and
transferred
my
left
hand
from
the
tube
to
the
slowly
i
climbed
down
the
oscillations
of
the
ladder
were
startling
and
feeling
for
the
rungs
was
a
purgatory
at
last
i
was
clear
of
the
well
and
under
the
bottom
of
the
aëronef
hanging
in
a
clear
space
between
the
huge
wheels
which
studded
it
now
s
your
time
yelled
norris
and
i
grabbed
the
of
the
parachute
with
my
right
hand
then
as
the
ladder
threatened
to
run
away
from
under
me
with
my
left
one
look
were
full
over
the
park
five
hundred
feet
or
so
from
the
turf
illustration
how
i
left
the
attila
let
go
i
shouted
and
flung
my
legs
from
the
ladder
on
which
they
were
resting
obliquely
for
a
second
and
a
half
my
heart
seemed
to
leap
into
my
mouth
for
i
fell
as
falls
a
spent
rocket
then
with
a
welcome
tug
on
me
the
parachute
bellied
out
and
fear
gave
place
to
confidence
nay
to
exhilaration
what
a
spectacle
above
me
fled
the
like
some
evil
bird
of
night
north
west
south
east
rose
the
crimson
hues
of
the
below
i
heard
the
clamours
of
the
populace
and
saw
the
darker
stand
out
against
the
dark
face
of
the
park
the
wind
blowing
strongly
i
was
borne
south
near
a
patch
of
trees
and
had
reason
to
fear
for
the
moment
that
a
nasty
mishap
was
imminent
happily
fortune
favoured
me
and
gliding
oilily
and
without
shock
to
the
ground
i
made
off
rapidly
in
the
direction
of
bayswater
chapter
xiii
in
the
streets
of
the
burning
city
thus
far
i
had
fared
unexpectedly
well
by
the
luckiest
of
chances
i
had
alighted
without
having
been
observed
and
this
was
the
more
remarkable
seeing
that
the
park
swarmed
with
noisy
multitudes
which
i
could
not
have
sighted
from
the
not
thirty
yards
from
my
some
brawl
or
outrage
was
in
progress
and
the
deep
curses
of
men
mingled
with
the
shrieks
and
appeals
of
women
told
me
that
it
was
no
mild
one
as
i
neared
the
bayswater
road
i
came
upon
crowds
of
fugitives
from
the
fire
and
the
almost
equally
cruel
mob
now
master
of
the
streets
delicate
ladies
and
children
invalids
shivering
in
their
wraps
aristocrats
plutocrats
and
tradespeople
were
huddled
into
groups
of
the
oddest
imaginable
composition
many
of
the
men
carried
weapons
and
it
was
well
for
them
and
their
convoys
when
they
did
so
for
bands
of
ruffians
were
prowling
round
robbing
insulting
and
murdering
at
random
one
savage
brute
rushed
at
me
but
a
seasonable
click
of
my
revolver
sufficed
to
sober
him
all
this
time
i
was
being
devoured
by
anxiety
the
terrible
licence
here
boded
no
good
for
carshalton
terrace
always
supposing
the
northertons
had
received
no
benefit
from
the
guarded
hints
given
to
hartmann
bearing
in
mind
my
interview
with
the
old
lady
i
had
grave
cause
to
fear
that
these
hints
had
been
far
too
vaguely
worded
in
which
case
nothing
was
more
likely
than
that
they
had
been
ignored
who
unless
clearly
warned
would
have
looked
for
a
revolution
so
sudden
and
mysterious
as
this
hartmann
had
wished
to
spare
his
mother
new
revelations
during
his
short
visit
but
he
had
of
course
wished
also
to
warn
her
of
these
impending
horrors
he
might
have
well
fallen
between
two
stools
and
robbed
his
caution
of
the
emphasis
and
impressiveness
it
called
for
the
upshot
of
the
night
proved
that
my
fears
were
only
too
well
founded
a
bright
light
shot
downwards
from
the
sky
on
a
patch
of
buildings
which
were
immediately
lapped
in
flames
i
understood
the
drama
was
running
into
its
third
act
the
then
soaring
some
two
miles
away
over
kensington
had
exchanged
the
of
dynamitard
for
that
of
an
aërial
a
more
frightful
conception
had
surely
never
entered
the
mind
of
man
all
the
more
reason
for
despatch
in
case
things
had
gone
wrong
at
the
terrace
hurriedly
fighting
my
way
out
of
the
park
i
joined
the
tumultuous
yelling
mob
that
flowed
like
a
river
in
freshet
along
the
bayswater
road
in
the
direction
of
notting
hill
but
what
a
gauntlet
i
had
to
run
the
mansions
lining
the
thoroughfare
were
being
looted
by
the
dozen
and
their
inmates
shamefully
maltreated
or
butchered
while
in
many
places
the
hand
of
the
incendiary
was
crowning
the
work
of
destruction
it
was
opposite
these
places
that
the
struggles
of
the
mob
were
most
arduous
after
a
house
had
been
alight
for
some
time
the
passage
past
it
necessarily
became
dangerous
but
owing
to
the
steady
pressure
of
the
mass
of
people
from
behind
no
one
once
entangled
in
the
mob
could
hope
to
avoid
it
numberless
deaths
occurred
by
the
mere
forcing
of
the
fringe
of
the
crowd
on
to
the
pavements
and
into
the
yellow
and
ruddy
mouths
of
the
outleaping
jets
of
flame
and
these
deaths
were
terrible
sights
to
witness
illustration
over
kensington
for
myself
i
had
seen
from
the
first
that
the
press
could
no
more
be
stemmed
by
me
than
rapids
can
be
stemmed
by
a
cork
one
could
get
into
the
stream
easily
enough
but
getting
free
of
it
was
quite
out
of
the
question
it
was
a
case
of
navigating
between
scylla
and
charybdis
on
the
one
side
i
saw
men
and
women
crushed
trampled
on
and
suffocated
against
the
railings
on
the
other
i
saw
scores
forced
into
the
flames
which
their
own
comrades
had
kindled
the
safest
place
was
in
the
current
that
was
now
sweeping
me
along
a
current
which
ran
some
three
feet
off
the
pavement
on
the
left
a
place
fairly
out
of
reach
of
the
flames
and
blasts
of
heat
from
the
houses
on
the
opposite
side
by
dint
of
great
efforts
i
managed
to
keep
in
this
though
strong
often
threatened
my
safety
and
at
last
sorely
bruised
and
battered
with
face
scarlet
with
the
scorching
heat
found
myself
opposite
the
queen
s
road
here
i
seized
my
opportunity
and
working
clear
of
the
stream
dodged
in
among
a
thinner
crowd
wearied
but
still
intent
on
my
purpose
as
i
rushed
in
and
out
of
the
groups
and
files
of
people
i
became
aware
that
i
should
speedily
be
left
almost
alone
thinner
and
thinner
grew
the
groups
and
the
reason
was
easy
to
discover
right
ahead
of
me
from
the
queen
s
road
station
downwards
to
westbourne
grove
the
streets
on
both
sides
were
being
fired
by
bands
of
ruffians
followed
by
armed
companies
of
marauders
with
their
vilest
passions
unchained
not
a
soldier
volunteer
or
policeman
was
whole
organization
of
society
seemed
to
have
fallen
through
ever
and
anon
sharp
revolver
cracks
and
rifle
reports
testified
to
hideous
scenes
in
these
houses
and
women
chased
by
flames
or
even
more
cruel
men
could
be
seen
to
rush
shrieking
into
the
street
i
knew
how
severe
a
gauntlet
had
to
be
run
but
clutching
my
revolver
made
a
dash
along
the
centre
of
the
roadway
as
i
passed
a
shop
vomiting
clouds
of
smoke
and
sparks
a
miserable
woman
rushed
out
and
clung
to
my
knees
in
a
frenzy
entreating
me
for
the
love
of
heaven
to
save
her
even
as
she
clung
to
me
two
of
the
dashed
after
in
hot
pursuit
but
i
lost
no
energy
in
parley
in
less
time
than
it
takes
to
write
of
it
i
shot
them
down
and
leaving
them
bleeding
and
dying
dragged
my
charge
into
the
centre
of
the
roadway
i
can
t
stay
i
shouted
work
your
way
up
the
street
into
the
crowd
going
to
shepherd
s
bush
it
s
far
safer
then
without
waiting
for
a
word
i
plunged
once
more
down
the
the
fiery
houses
glowing
like
coal
under
forced
the
incendiaries
the
butchers
and
smoking
and
with
singed
clothes
and
almost
stifled
with
smoke
i
found
myself
in
westbourne
grove
here
i
saw
a
terrified
horse
lying
between
the
poles
of
a
splintered
cart
i
was
going
to
shoot
him
out
of
mercy
when
the
thought
struck
me
that
he
might
be
useful
hastily
loosening
the
harness
i
assisted
the
poor
beast
to
rise
and
leaping
on
his
back
galloped
down
the
grove
road
the
windfall
was
indeed
propitious
within
ten
minutes
i
found
myself
on
the
pavement
by
carshalton

where
tethering
my
steed
to

i
leaped
up
the
steps
to

door
thank
goodness
the
district
as
yet
was
unharmed
furiously
i
plied
the
knocker
beating
the

at
the

heard

over
what
seemed
to
be
kensington
but
of
the
few
awkward
incidents
i
can
scarcely
now
remember
one
my
chief
enemy
indeed
was
a
poignant
anxiety
about
lena
it
must
have
been
ten
o
clock
by
the
time
i
galloped
into
islington
tired
hungry
and
unkempt
but
devoured
by
emotions
which
sternly
forbade
a
halt
five
minutes
brought
me
to
the
villa
and
throwing
the
reins
over
the
railing
i
pushed
the
gate
aside
and
entered
the
door
of
the
house
was
open
and
the
sound
of
voices
came
from
within
revolver
in
hand
i
entered
but
a
glance
dispelled
my
apprehensions
the
little
room
so
familiar
to
me
was
full
of
terrified
women
with
here
and
there
a
sturdy
workman
among
them
at
my
entrance
there
was
something
like
a
panic
but
i
speedily
reassured
the
company
where
are
miss
northerton
and
the
old
lady
was
my
first
question
after
soothing
the
tumult
a
sister
of
charity
came
forward
do
you
bring
any
message
hartmann
i
must
tell
you
is
but
is
safe
and
in
attendance
upon
a
wave
of
delight
rolled
through
me
how
selfish
we
all
are
the
news
about
hartmann
weighed
as
nothing
with
me
for
the
minute
can
i
send
a
message
to
the
young
lady
is
it
important
then
i
will
take
it
i
scribbled
a
few
words
on
a
scrap
of
paper
and
handed
it
to
the
sister
who
immediately
left
the
room
i
had
not
long
to
wait
before
she
returned
saying
that
the
lady
would
see
me
i
was
shown
up
to
the
where
lena
was
sitting
by
the
bedside
she
greeted
me
with
a
regard
chastened
by
the
gravity
of
the
occasion
after
a
moment
s
delay
i
stepped
up
to
the
bed
and
looked
at
the
patient
she
had
been
unconscious
so
they
told
me
for
some
time
and
was
now
dying
rapidly
a
few
hurried
whispered
words
told
the
story
hartmann
had
gone
to
westminster
with
lena
on
the
fatal
morning
of
the
previous
day
to
witness
the
great
labour
demonstration
and
the
old
lady
had
been
brutally
trampled
in
parliament
street
by
the
mob
indeed
but
for
a
company
of
volunteers
who
succeeded
in
momentarily
beating
back
the
rush
both
ladies
would
have
perished
said
the
sister
hartmann
thus
barely
snatched
from
death
had
felt
well
enough
to
struggle
back
to
islington
with
lena
having
after
an
hour
of
weary
waiting
and
at
great
expense
procured
a
cart
and
driver
everything
seemed
on
the
to
chaos
and
the
return
was
only
accomplished
after
great
risks
had
been
run
from
the
mob
things
looked
better
however
when
they
managed
to
get
out
of
the
more
central
districts
and
ultimately
they
reached
the
villa
in
safety
considerably
surprised
at
the
relatively
quiet
state
of
the
neighbourhood
soon
after
entering
the
house
however
hartmann
was
attacked
by
violent
pains
and
nausea
and
on
the
advent
of
a
friendly
doctor
it
was
found
that
she
had
sustained
the
most
grave
internal
injuries
hæmorrhage
set
in
later
and
she
rapidly
became
worse
before
becoming
unconscious
she
had
dictated
a
letter
for
her
son
nobody
knew
that
he
was
alive
added
my
informant
and
had
desired
lena
to
hand
it
to
me
for
transmission
very
pathetic
in
character
it
narrated
the
facts
here
recorded
and
ended
with
a
last
appeal
to
him
from
a
dying
mother
to
better
his
dark
and
misguided
life
poor
lady
she
little
knew
who
her
son
really
was
and
how
he
had
himself
unwittingly
hurried
her
to
the
grave
hartmann
passed
away
about
an
hour
later
lena
and
i
reverently
kissed
the
aged
and
venerable
forehead
and
paid
the
last
tributes
to
our
friend
then
leaving
the
i
took
lena
into
a
morning
room
and
acquainted
her
with
my
extraordinary
experiences
since
we
had
parted
she
listened
with
the
keenest
interest
and
was
appalled
to
think
that
anarchist
assailant
of
be
the
son
of
the
poor
harmless
lady
whose
body
lay
so
still
in
the
adjoining
chamber
sometimes
indeed
she
seemed
quite
unable
to
follow
me
and
bent
searching
glances
on
me
as
if
to
make
sure
that
i
was
not
after
all
romancing
no
doubt
my
tale
sounded
fantastic
but
conceive
the
man
who
could
romance
on
so
peculiarly
solemn
an
occasion
but
did
you
not
see
the
aëronef
yourself
i
asked
no
we
were
hopelessly
jammed
up
in
the
crowd
near
whitehall
the
wildest
rumours
were
afloat
fires
were
breaking
out
everywhere
cannon
booming
and
the
mob
breaking
into
shops
and
stores
it
was
impossible
to
see
far
owing
to
the
a
bright
trail
of
light
flashed
down
the
heavens
to
the
look
lena
look
there
is
the
itself
now
will
you
believe
me
the
deluge
of
fire
had
not
yet
ceased
to
fall
we
stood
riveted
with
horror
to
the
window
do
you
see
the
glowing
on
her
blazing
petroleum
splashing
down
from
her
sides
on
to
the
ah
there
will
be
a
pretty
story
to
tell
of
this
in
the
lena
could
only
gasp
in
answer
the
with
her
one
electric
eye
stood
out
sharply
against
the
clouds
with
trails
of
fire
lengthening
out
behind
her
and
as
the
burning
liquid
fell
one
could
see
the
flames
from
the
gutted
houses
leap
upwards
as
if
to
greet
it
whole
acres
of
buildings
were
ablaze
and
one
dared
not
think
what
that
deluge
must
mean
for
the
desperate
mobs
below
and
no
human
art
could
avail
here
in
this
extraordinary
vessel
the
vices
and
powers
of
man
had
been
brought
to
a
common
focus
the
seemed
mad
with
the
irresponsibility
of
strength
and
yet
to
the
captain
of
that
fell
craft
now
suspended
in
over
the
doomed
city
i
had
somehow
to
transmit
the
letter
of
his
dead
mother
the
thought
struck
us
both
at
once
what
about
that
letter
said
lena
as
we
watched
the
destructive
gyrations
of
the
aëronef
i
took
it
from
her
hand
reverentially
i
shall
do
my
best
to
deliver
it
one
of
the
crew
i
remembered
schwartz
remark
is
likely
to
descend
shortly
possibly
i
may
meet
him
if
not
i
must
wait
for
my
chance
believe
me
lena
this
letter
if
i
can
ever
deliver
it
will
prove
the
most
terrible
retribution
possible
and
now
we
must
be
off
your
parents
are
seriously
alarmed
and
for
their
sakes
you
must
ride
back
with
me
without
illustration
look
lena
look
it
was
late
in
the
morning
when
i
snatched
a
broken
rest
at
the
northertons
but
in
seeking
my
was
far
too
terrible
a
time
to
think
of
had
at
least
the
consolation
that
lena
was
restored
safe
and
sound
to
her
father
and
mother
and
last
and
perhaps
not
least
to
myself
it
seemed
too
that
we
could
detect
some
lull
in
the
fury
of
the
conflagration
though
to
what
this
was
due
we
were
unable
of
course
to
ascertain
lull
however
or
no
lull
caution
was
still
indispensable
and
old
northerton
and
the
butler
armed
to
the
teeth
kept
a
dreary
vigil
till
the
morning
broke
in
sullenness
chapter
xv
the
morrow
of
the
disasters
it
was
late
when
i
came
to
learn
what
the
night
had
brought
forth
northerton
was
kindness
itself
and
persisted
in
regarding
me
as
lena
s
heroic
rescuer
whereas
i
had
really
done
nothing
which
entitled
me
to
distinction
our
midnight
ride
had
been
only
that
of
two
people
on
one
horse
for
no
molestation
whatever
had
been
offered
us
still
taking
time
by
the
forelock
i
suggested
that
the
rescuer
had
some
claim
on
the
lady
and
finally
revealed
our
secret
at
the
true
psychological
moment
northerton
said
she
had
long
looked
forward
to
the
union
and
that
her
husband
had
been
quite
as
sagacious
as
herself
she
was
only
sorry
that
things
looked
so
black
around
us
how
would
all
this
anarchy
end
it
was
scarcely
a
time
to
think
of
hymen
for
aught
we
could
tell
we
might
all
be
beggared
or
possibly
even
butchered
to
make
an
anarchist
s
holiday
the
story
of
my
adventures
was
retold
in
detail
and
the
astonishment
of
my
hearers
at
the
revelations
knew
no
bounds
they
had
wondered
greatly
at
my
absence
but
were
now
of
opinion
that
to
have
sailed
the
air
in
the
was
a
privilege
the
historian
would
grudge
me
i
replied
that
the
spectacle
of
the
great
massacre
was
so
far
from
being
a
privilege
that
the
bare
memory
of
it
horrified
me
had
i
known
exactly
what
to
expect
i
should
have
accepted
hartmann
s
offer
and
have
been
promptly
landed
beforehand
my
narrative
having
come
to
an
end
we
were
speculating
on
the
outlook
when
a
tramp
of
feet
arrested
us
and
all
four
of
us
rushed
simultaneously
to
the
window
good
cheer
a
regiment
of
volunteers
was
marching
briskly
towards
the
park
their
bayonets
flashing
brightly
in
the
sunlight
was
there
a
reaction
had
the
forces
of
order
rallied
had
the
progress
of
the
been
checked
in
a
very
short
time
i
was
in
the
street
greedy
for
information
accosting
an
officer
i
asked
him
what
was
the
news
he
said
that
the
aëronef
had
ceased
dropping
petroleum
that
a
vigorous
reaction
had
taken
place
that
the
conflagrations
were
partly
checked
while
the
anarchists
and
rioters
were
being
driven
mercilessly
from
the
streets
with
bullet
and
cold
steel
without
more
ado
i
ran
back
into
the
house
and
shouting
the
good
tidings
to
old
northerton
enlisted
him
forthwith
for
an
expedition
our
plan
of
campaign
was
speedily
agreed
upon
we
would
make
our
way
to
hyde
park
and
find
out
all
about
the
destruction
of
last
night
from
the
crowds
who
would
be
sure
to
gather
there
northerton
and
lena
protested
as
was
only
to
be
expected
but
very
little
attention
i
am
afraid
was
paid
to
them
taking
a
satchel
of
provisions
and
a
couple
of
flasks
of
claret
with
us
we
left
the
ladies
to
brood
over
our
temerity
at
their
leisure
one
thing
must
be
added
though
it
seemed
improbable
that
chances
would
favour
me
i
stuffed
into
my
poor
hartmann
s
last
letter
it
certainly
would
not
be
my
fault
if
her
fiendish
son
failed
to
get
it
and
having
got
it
to
relish
it
we
followed
the
regiment
for
a
while
till
westbourne
grove
was
reached
the
heat
smoke
and
dust
here
were
intolerable
and
whole
clumps
of
buildings
were
still
merrily
blazing
every
now
and
then
the
crack
of
rifles
could
be
heard
and
we
knew
that
somewhere
or
other
justice
was
being
summarily
administered
at
this
point
a
stranger
evidently
a
gentleman
stepped
up
and
asked
us
if
we
had
heard
the
latest
we
answered
that
both
the
events
of
the
night
and
early
morning
were
for
the
most
part
unknown
to
us
thereupon
he
stated
that
all
through
the
night
fires
were
being
kindled
in
every
direction
by
the
aëronef
it
had
been
discovered
too
that
hundreds
if
not
thousands
of
confederates
were
pushing
on
this
abominable
work
below
and
that
these
by
inciting
the
mob
to
violence
had
greatly
assisted
to
swell
the
terrible
list
of
catastrophes
he
added
that
the
aëronef
had
drawn
off
awhile
and
was
wheeling
idly
around
the
park
in
wide
circles
occasionally
discharging
her
guns
whenever
the
crowds
grew
dense
meantime
order
had
been
partially
military
albeit
many
soldiers
were
suspected
of
complicity
had
been
called
out
the
police
at
first
helpless
had
rallied
and
volunteer
regiments
and
special
police
corps
were
pouring
on
to
the
different
scenes
of
action
anarchists
and
rioters
were
being
shot
down
in
batches
and
it
was
believed
that
all
with
the
aëronef
from
below
had
been
at
last
practically
extirpated
then
came
an
announcement
which
moved
me
to
barely
repressed
excitement
the
aëronef
during
the
early
morning
had
been
seen
to
descend
in
the
park
and
to
deposit
four
men
subsequently
rising
to
her
old
altitude
the
police
were
now
searching
for
them
in
all
directions
and
it
was
said
that
their
arrest
was
imminent
did
you
hear
of
the
balloon
attack
continued
our
communicative
informant
no
we
replied
in
unison
deeply
interested
well
some
time
after
midnight
the
thought
occurred
to
bates
the
aëronaut
that
this
aëronef
might
possibly
be
fought
in
her
own
element
in
the
grounds
of
the
military
exhibition
in
south
kensington
was
the
balloon
used
for
visitors
ascents
providing
himself
with
a
rifle
and
three
terribly
risky
thing
no
doubt
but
look
at
the
emergency
had
the
silk
inflated
and
the
wind
suiting
rose
up
steadily
meaning
to
get
above
his
opponent
and
if
possible
shatter
her
with
his
missiles
unfortunately
the
blaze
rushing
up
from
a
group
of
mansions
revealed
the
daring
aëronaut
it
was
a
pretty
if
a
terrible
little
balloon
drifting
up
towards
the
mighty
aëronef
in
the
glow
of
those
blazing
did
he
get
near
enough
to
throw
no
poor
fellow
a
journalist
who
was
below
with
a
says
that
he
never
had
even
a
chance
one
of
the
men
on
the
deck
of
the
aëronef
pulled
out
a
revolver
and
fired
and
the
balloon
pierced
through
and
through
at
once
began
to
descend
rapidly
on
its
reaching
the
ground
with
a
shock
in
earl
s
court
road
the
bombs
exploded
and
the
car
and
its
plucky
occupant
were
shattered
to
illustration
the
balloon
never
had
a
chance
poor
chap
a
wild
attempt
but
rats
in
a
hole
can
not
be
particular
said
old
northerton
thanking
our
informant
heartily
we
moved
hastily
on
both
eager
to
see
something
of
the
movements
of
the
terrible
vessel
the
landing
of
the
four
men
did
not
perplex
me
for
long
schwartz
as
i
knew
had
been
prepared
to
descend
but
why
four
in
this
enterprise
for
which
one
alone
had
been
originally
told
off
the
solution
which
suggested
itself
to
me
was
this
despite
the
devastation
he
had
caused
hartmann
was
very
dissatisfied
with
the
result
his
vast
outlay
of
material
had
not
effected
the
ruin
of
part
of
the
great
city
while
in
all
probability
the
resources
of
the
were
becoming
somewhat
strained
relatively
to
her
size
these
resources
were
undoubtedly
slender
and
it
was
requisite
accordingly
to
devise
some
new
and
less
costly
mode
of
attack
of
the
lull
in
the
work
of
the
incendiaries
hartmann
must
have
got
wind
but
not
knowing
the
cause
of
it
and
anxious
to
secure
a
redoubled
activity
so
indispensable
to
his
had
despatched
four
of
the
crew
to
fan
their
energies
into
fury
that
their
efforts
would
be
futile
was
now
certain
enough
the
problematical
part
of
the
affair
was
the
supposition
that
they
would
ever
get
back
to
their
baffled
leader
at
all
probably
they
were
now
bitterly
regretting
their
temerity
if
indeed
they
had
not
been
shot
against
the
wall
by
the
furious
restorers
of
order
just
then
a
squad
of
soldiers
passed
by
escorting
some
incendiaries
whose
faces
filthy
with
grime
and
brutal
to
a
degree
filled
us
with
loathing
and
anger
they
were
to
be
shot
in
a
neighbouring
mews
and
if
the
accounts
we
heard
were
reliable
richly
deserved
their
fate
what
kicks
their
captors
were
giving
them
the
faces
seemed
unfamiliar
to
me
all
alike
of
a
low
grade
of
ruffianism
such
as
every
great
city
breeds
but
which
never
declares
its
strength
till
the
day
of
weakness
arrives
but
suddenly
one
of
the
wretches
who
lagged
somewhat
behind
the
rest
received
a
sharp
cuff
from
a
soldier
and
in
the
volley
of
curses
that
followed
i
recognized
a
and
voice
it
was
that
of
michael
schwartz
who
bruised
handcuffed
befouled
with
grime
and
dirt
was
being
driven
like
a
bullock
to
a
how
savage
a
despair
must
have
goaded
him
in
the
last
few
minutes
of
his
dark
and
damnable
life
i
turned
away
with
a
shudder
glad
however
to
think
that
this
fiend
at
least
was
no
longer
to
cumber
the
ground
might
the
three
other
men
of
his
party
meet
with
the
same
luck
after
s
walk
we
found
ourselves
in
hyde
park
our
informant
had
not
misled
us
high
above
the
sward
circled
the
her
graceful
flight
and
vast
bulk
her
sides
and
projecting
aëroplane
her
long
ruddy
flag
streaming
over
the
her
horned
bow
and
above
all
her
now
hideous
repute
rendering
her
a
weirdly
conspicuous
object
old
northerton
s
face
was
a
picture
the
look
he
bent
on
me
was
one
of
unconcealed
and
almost
childish
wonder
at
the
aëronef
and
of
deep
respect
for
his
who
had
actually
trodden
its
deck
he
seemed
fascinated
by
the
wondrous
air
vessel
and
lamented
loudly
that
its
conception
should
have
lodged
in
so
unworthy
and
fiendish
a
mind
think
what
a
good
man
might
have
effected
for
his
kind
for
their
and
commerce
for
the
cause
of
civilization
science
and
culture
a
fleet
of
such
ships
would
render
england
monarch
of
the
nations
and
arm
her
with
power
to
sweep
away
hordes
of
monstrous
iniquities
war
could
be
finally
stamped
out
and
universal
arbitration
substituted
for
until
france
or
russia
began
to
launch
similar
fleets
i
added
for
it
seemed
clear
enough
that
nations
who
could
fight
with
armies
and
ironclads
would
have
no
insuperable
prejudice
against
fighting
with
if
only
one
nation
possessed
these
aëronefs
she
would
doubtless
silence
the
rest
but
in
actual
practice
inventions
of
this
character
can
not
be
permanently
kept
secret
there
were
very
few
persons
in
the
park
for
the
dread
of
the
aëronef
was
universal
her
guns
dexterously
singled
out
crowds
hence
no
one
wished
to
recruit
them
and
any
symptom
of
their
formation
in
the
neighbourhood
speedily
corrected
itself
outside
the
railings
indeed
there
were
plenty
of
onlookers
but
there
the
military
patrolled
the
streets
and
bodies
of
mounted
police
vigorously
seconded
their
efforts
i
was
told
by
a
bystander
that
severe
fighting
was
going
on
in
east
london
but
that
nothing
serious
of
late
was
reported
from
the
west
end
this
sounded
all
very
well
but
what
if
the
was
once
more
to
fire
how
about
the
restoration
of
order
then
would
regiments
clear
the
streets
under
bomb
fire
would
police
hunt
down
incendiaries
in
the
teeth
of
petroleum
showers
the
man
admitted
that
in
that
case
chaos
must
follow
but
nevertheless
he
reckoned
the
vessel
was
emptied
she
can
t
hold
much
more
stuff
at
any
the
reed
was
unfortunately
slender
as
he
had
shortly
cause
to
discover
i
was
gazing
at
the
stray
onlookers
around
us
when
a
strange
group
caught
my
eye
two
men
had
just
entered
the
park
followed
by
a
third
with
his
hat
pulled
well
forward
over
his
brow
the
two
men
in
advance
were
talking
excitedly
and
pointed
at
intervals
to
the
aëronef
something
in
their
faces
riveted
my
attention
and
as
they
came
nearer
i
recognized
norris
among
them
ay
and
the
villainous
thomas
himself
was
bringing
up
the
rear
what
were
they
doing
here
at
such
an
hour
my
notion
was
that
their
mission
had
completely
failed
that
their
associates
were
being
shot
down
and
that
they
were
now
seeking
a
haven
from
danger
in
the
but
was
it
possible
that
they
could
be
embarked
in
the
broad
light
of
day
in
the
face
of
crowd
police
and
military
were
they
even
expected
back
so
early
from
the
fulfilment
of
their
task
whatever
the
explanation
might
thing
was
clear
the
chance
for
my
letter
had
come
as
norris
passed
me
i
looked
him
full
in
the
grew
pale
as
death
and
i
saw
him
feel
spasmodically
for
his
revolver
evidently
he
thought
that
i
should
denounce
him
and
was
prepared
to
die
biting
of
course
no
semblance
of
such
a
plan
had
crossed
my
mind
hateful
to
me
as
were
these
anarchists
they
had
treated
me
well
on
the
and
with
them
i
had
once
amicably
broken
salt
honour
shielded
even
the
enemies
of
the
human
race
from
such
a
scurvy
return
brushing
past
norris
i
whispered
a
the
captain
stuffing
it
dexterously
into
his
hand
at
the
same
time
this
action
passed
wholly
unnoticed
even
by
norris
companions
while
the
worthy
was
far
too
well
absorbed
in
the
aëronef
to
mark
my
brief
departure
from
his
side
norris
himself
passed
on
hurriedly
directing
his
steps
to
the
central
portion
of
the
park
i
watched
the
three
anarchists
till
they
reached
an
almost
deserted
spot
about
four
hundred
yards
off
and
it
then
became
evident
that
they
were
bent
on
signalling
to
the
for
aught
i
knew
hartmann
in
his
was
even
now
sweeping
the
sward
with
his
powerful
i
saw
norris
produce
something
out
of
the
breast
of
his
coat
and
fuddle
eagerly
about
it
with
his
companions
the
anarchists
then
lay
down
on
the
grass
and
seemed
to
be
awaiting
some
answer
it
was
some
time
however
before
i
seized
the
true
rendering
of
their
conduct
and
but
for
a
stray
yellow
gleam
showing
up
between
norris
and
one
of
the
others
i
should
not
have
seized
it
at
all
the
device
adopted
was
simple
the
gallant
three
were
evidently
being
waited
and
watched
for
to
ensure
notice
they
had
agreed
to
exhibit
a
large
yellow
flag
and
for
security
s
sake
they
had
unrolled
this
at
full
length
on
the
grass
lying
round
it
at
the
same
time
so
as
to
screen
it
from
observation
the
problem
remaining
over
was
how
the
was
to
get
them
safely
on
board
she
was
perhaps
two
hundred
and
fifty
feet
above
them
at
the
moment
and
the
difficulty
in
such
a
situation
seemed
almost
insuperable
suddenly
a
cry
from
northerton
arrested
me
the
aëronef
was
curving
swiftly
in
and
out
so
as
to
trace
a
sort
of
descending
spiral
then
when
nearly
over
the
flag
she
stopped
almost
dead
and
seemed
to
be
falling
rapidly
it
s
falling
it
s
falling
yelled
northerton
but
i
knew
better
that
fall
was
adjusted
by
the
the
sank
slowly
to
the
ground
the
police
military
and
spectators
outside
and
inside
the
railing
rushed
forward
to
the
scene
with
loud
cries
of
exultation
all
were
seized
with
the
desire
to
be
in
at
the
death
to
vent
their
rage
on
the
foe
who
now
seemed
to
have
lost
his
might
it
was
with
the
greatest
trouble
that
i
held
northerton
back
he
was
carried
away
by
the
sight
of
the
thousands
streaming
into
the
park
and
converging
in
masses
on
the
fallen
monster
they
were
now
close
up
several
told
that
the
soldiers
to
the
fore
were
already
hotly
engaged
were
perhaps
striving
to
storm
the
hull
and
then
came
a
dread
disenchantment
chapter
xvi
the
last
of
the
attila
as
the
rabble
closed
on
the
aëronef
she
gave
a
huge
heave
her
bow
swinging
over
her
assailants
like
the
tilted
arm
of
a
next
the
stern
cleared
the
turf
and
the
colossus
rose
majestically
rolling
the
while
like
some
ship
riding
at
anchor
the
gnats
who
clung
to
her
bottom
and
gallery
dropped
off
confusedly
and
the
whole
multitude
in
her
neighbourhood
seemed
bewildered
with
surprise
and
terror
suddenly
the
was
enveloped
in
flame
and
smoke
the
roar
of
her
big
pieces
mingling
with
the
cracks
of
the
and
the
rifle
fire
that
spirted
from
the
in
her
armour
lanes
were
cut
in
the
crowd
in
all
directions
and
a
veritable
hail
of
bullets
whistled
past
the
spot
where
we
stood
many
even
claiming
their
victims
around
us
discretion
not
valour
was
our
choice
we
made
wildly
for
the
outlets
toward
which
a
screaming
mob
rushed
behind
us
and
once
through
them
made
our
way
rapidly
down
the
street
having
run
some
few
hundred
yards
we
stopped
and
saw
with
dismay
how
narrow
had
been
our
escape
the
was
still
rising
majestically
with
her
machine
and
guns
playing
on
the
multitude
as
a
hose
plays
on
flames
the
wretched
victims
were
fighting
for
the
blocked
gates
and
outlets
like
creatures
possessed
bloody
gaps
opened
and
shut
in
their
midst
and
heaps
of
butchered
and
trampled
bodies
tripped
up
the
frantic
survivors
in
batches
as
they
ran
the
din
was
simply
unearthly
the
picture
as
a
whole
indescribable
not
being
set
off
by
two
or
three
easily
detachable
features
but
so
compositely
appalling
in
its
details
as
to
baffle
the
deftest
pen
it
lingers
still
vividly
in
my
memory
the
cloudy
pall
above
the
still
smoking
and
ruined
houses
opposite
the
park
the
heaving
crowd
with
its
multitudinous
detail
of
slaughter
suffocation
and
writhings
the
hull
of
the
as
it
rose
in
angry
majesty
its
top
peering
like
the
matterhorn
through
were
fraught
with
a
fascination
that
held
us
enthralled
the
sight
would
have
moved
the
pity
of
a
borgia
and
glutted
to
the
full
the
morbid
æstheticism
of
a
nero
illustration
the
attila
rose
majestically
but
the
massacre
was
as
short
as
it
was
swift
when
the
aëronef
had
reached
the
height
of
one
hundred
and
fifty
feet
she
suddenly
ceased
firing
and
began
once
more
to
circle
with
grace
in
the
path
she
had
previously
favoured
what
was
the
motive
for
this
strange
suspension
of
hostilities
possibly
her
munitions
were
failing
and
the
thought
of
departure
with
his
grim
project
unaccomplished
had
forced
hartmann
to
husband
his
resources
and
await
some
novel
opportunities
for
mischief
at
night
his
state
of
mind
however
must
have
been
even
at
that
moment
unenviable
that
he
had
yet
received
the
fatal
letter
might
or
might
not
be
the
case
but
quite
apart
from
this
thunderbolt
he
had
a
gloomy
prospect
to
brood
over
the
failure
of
his
artillery
and
petroleum
to
effect
the
ruin
he
had
contemplated
was
in
his
catastrophe
while
the
extirpation
of
the
anarchist
rising
below
rendered
his
very
security
dubious
of
the
success
or
defeat
of
the
continental
anarchists
we
had
as
yet
heard
nothing
owing
to
the
disorganization
of
the
usual
channels
of
information
but
seeing
that
the
attack
in
london
had
failed
it
was
highly
probable
that
it
had
withered
away
utterly
in
places
where
there
was
no
to
back
it
in
this
event
the
situation
of
hartmann
would
be
precarious
defiant
of
human
effort
as
seemed
the
aëronef
it
was
nevertheless
to
a
large
extent
dependent
on
the
maintenance
of
its
communications
with
which
had
hitherto
been
kept
up
with
the
various
continental
anarchist
groups
coals
provisions
gas
munitions
of
all
sorts
had
to
be
allowed
for
but
in
the
of
modern
anarchism
and
complete
exposure
of
its
secrets
things
might
come
to
such
a
pass
that
the
would
be
altogether
without
a
basis
deprived
of
which
her
death
from
inanition
was
a
mere
question
of
time
here
was
a
fine
opportunity
for
the
governments
an
opportunity
which
could
not
well
have
escaped
the
acute
vision
of
hartmann
ah
well
we
should
see
at
this
stage
my
speculations
were
cut
short
by
a
rush
of
fugitives
down
the
street
and
unable
to
breast
the
torrent
we
took
the
wisest
course
and
flowed
with
it
some
way
further
on
however
the
panic
began
to
ease
down
then
slowly
died
away
until
many
stopped
outright
to
gaze
on
the
destroyer
which
sailed
so
contemptuously
above
them
some
even
found
their
way
back
to
the
park
anxious
to
do
what
they
could
for
the
hundreds
of
wounded
and
dying
wretches
who
littered
the
sward
for
an
area
of
at
least
three
hundred
square
yards
and
whose
cries
would
have
shocked
the
denizens
of
malebolge
we
were
about
to
do
the
same
when
the
road
was
summarily
cleared
by
police
and
all
further
access
to
the
scene
prohibited
we
were
protesting
against
this
usage
when
a
voice
was
from
one
of
the
rooms
of
one
of
the
few
uninjured
houses
opposite
hi
here
is
that
you
northerton
come
in
man
come
i
looked
up
and
saw
leaning
from
a
window
an
elderly
gentleman
whom
i
recognized
as
a
frequent
visitor
at
carshalton
terrace
we
accepted
forthwith
this
very
seasonable
invitation
and
mounting
the
steps
were
ushered
into
a
cosy
where
we
found
the
whole
family
assembled
the
old
gentleman
whose
name
was
wingate
could
talk
of
nothing
of
course
but
the
one
absorbing
subject
the
and
her
depredations
an
attentive
circle
surrounded
us
as
we
recounted
the
story
of
the
last
shameful
massacre
the
ship
or
whatever
you
call
it
seems
quiet
again
observed
our
host
a
calm
before
a
storm
i
am
afraid
i
dread
to
think
what
this
night
may
have
in
store
for
and
i
too
my
idea
of
the
respite
is
simply
are
waiting
till
darkness
comes
on
and
will
take
merciless
advantage
of
the
facilities
it
offers
for
the
creation
of
panics
and
i
hear
continued
wingate
that
the
fires
are
being
got
under
control
but
that
westminster
southwark
brompton
kensington
the
city
and
adjoining
districts
are
no
better
than
smoking
ruins
heaven
shield
us
from
this
monster
by
the
way
i
put
in
have
you
a
good
glass
here
there
goes
the
destroyer
almost
within
yes
there
s
a
capital
one
which
used
to
do
duty
at
sea
when
i
was
a
yachtsman
come
and
try
i
followed
him
out
of
the
room
leaving
my
future
with
the
ladies
wingate
took
me
into
the
bedroom
immediately
above
and
drawing
a
leather
case
from
the
shelf
produced
a
capital
instrument
he
had
a
long
look
first
but
complained
of
the
difficulty
of
following
the
movements
of
the
aëronef
he
then
handed
it
to
me
to
report
if
possible
better
results
lifting
the
window
i
lay
back
on
the
floor
against
the
side
of
the
bed
and
steadying
the
barrel
on
the
edge
of
the
managed
to
obtain
an
excellent
view
do
you
see
anything
yes
she
s
turning
our
way
ah
that
s
better
how
delicate
this
glass
is
i
then
described
to
him
the
prominent
parts
of
the
more
or
less
in
detail
is
the
deck
crowded
no
there
are
several
men
round
the
battery
near
the
citadel
but
the
rest
of
the
deck
is
deserted
here
try
again
the
view
now
is
the
glass
once
more
changed
hands
what
a
sight
ejaculated
my
companion
having
succeeded
in
spotting
the
aëronef
why
i
can
see
the
whole
thing
just
as
if
it
was
only
across
the
road
just
as
you
described
it
too
by
the
way
there
is
a
solitary
individual
pacing
the
frantically
he
seems
terribly
excited
about
something
more
mischief
describe
him
i
cried
eagerly
easier
said
than
done
had
said
a
moment
before
that
the
whole
thing
was
as
clear
as
if
it
was
only
across
the
road
but
he
seems
very
tall
rather
dark
with
a
thick
black
beard
and
he
holds
some
letter
in
his
hand
which
he
kisses
and
then
brandishes
hartmann
by
all
that
s
holy
vindictively
i
bethought
me
of
the
letter
and
the
miserable
reports
of
failure
which
norris
and
his
men
must
have
delivered
i
should
say
he
is
the
captain
or
some
other
boss
in
authority
for
see
a
gunner
comes
up
and
salutes
him
ha
he
must
be
angry
he
dismisses
the
man
fiercely
and
seems
once
more
to
devour
the
go
on
go
on
he
steps
to
the
railing
and
shakes
his
fist
at
the
city
below
now
he
seems
to
be
deliberating
for
he
remains
perfectly
still
looking
every
now
and
then
at
the
letter
or
document
how
beside
himself
with
anger
he
seems
he
dashes
his
fist
on
the
railing
now
he
strides
across
the
deck
and
stalks
through
the
surprised
gunners
to
the
citadel
i
feel
sure
something
terrible
is
ha
captain
of
the
smart
under
the
lash
of
nemesis
matricide
and
murderer
writhe
you
felt
not
for
the
thousands
sacrificed
for
a
theory
feel
now
for
the
report
of
your
plans
wrecked
beyond
hope
of
repair
feel
too
for
a
loved
mother
the
sole
creature
you
ever
cared
for
but
whom
your
reckless
and
futile
savagery
has
immolated
hater
of
your
race
terrible
indeed
has
been
your
penalty
hallo
he
comes
up
again

a

a

shattering

a

hurling
us

dismayed
with
the
failure
of
his
plans
and
rendered
desperate
by
the
letter
had
blown
up
the
the
news
of
his
failure
and
the
message
of
a
dying
woman
had
done
what
human
hatred
was
too
impotent
even
to
hope
for
but
little
more
remains
to
be
said
you
are
conversant
with
the
story
of
the
next
few
days
you
know
also
how
order
was
once
more
completely
reestablished
how
the
wreckage
of
that
fell
hours
was
slowly
replaced
by
modern
buildings
how
gradually
the
empire
recovered
from
the
shock
and
how
dominant
henceforth
became
the
great
problems
of
labour
my
own
connection
with
these
latter
was
not
destined
to
endure
after
my
marriage
with
lena
my
interests
took
a
different
turn
travel
and
literary
studies
left
no
room
for
the
surlier
duties
of
the
demagogue
writing
from
this
quiet
german
retreat
i
can
only
hope
that
my
brief
narrative
will
prove
of
some
interest
to
you
it
has
not
been
my
aim
to
write
history
i
have
sought
to
throw
light
only
on
one
of
its
more
romantic
corners
and
if
i
have
succeeded
in
doing
so
the
whole
purpose
of
my
efforts
will
have
been
accomplished
