moon

leiber
illustrated
by
david
stone
who
wanted
to
escape
death
could
by
paying
a
very
simple
price
denial
of
life
effie
what
the
devil
are
you
up
to
her
husband
voice
chopping
through
her
mood
of
terrified
rapture
made
her
heart
jump
like
a
startled
cat
yet
by
some
miracle
of
feminine
her
body
did
not
show
a
tremor
she
thought
must
see
it
it
so
beautiful
and
he
always
kills
i
just
looking
at
the
moon
she
said
listlessly
it
green
must
see
and
now
with
luck
he
would
for
the
face
as
if
it
also
heard
and
sensed
the
menace
in
the
voice
was
moving
back
from
the
window
glow
into
the
outside
dark
but
slowly
reluctantly
and
still
faunlike
pleading
cajoling
tempting
and
incredibly
beautiful
close
the
shutters
at
once
you
little
fool
and
come
away
from
the
window
green
as
a
beer
bottle
she
went
on
dreamily
green
as
emeralds
green
as
leaves
with
sunshine
striking
through
them
and
green
grass
to
lie
on
she
could
help
saying
those
last
words
they
were
her
token
to
the
face
even
though
it
could
hear
effie
she
knew
what
that
last
tone
meant
wearily
she
swung
shut
the
ponderous
lead
inner
shutters
and
drove
home
the
heavy
bolts
that
hurt
her
fingers
it
always
did
but
he
must
know
that
you
know
that
those
shutters
are
not
to
be
touched
not
for
five
more
years
at
least
i
only
wanted
to
look
at
the
moon
she
said
turning
around
and
then
it
was
all
gone
the
face
the
night
the
moon
the
magic
and
she
was
back
in
the
grubby
stale
little
hole
facing
an
angry
stale
little
man
it
was
then
that
the
eternal
thud
of
the
fans
and
the
crackle
of
the
electrostatic
precipitators
that
sieved
out
the
dust
reached
her
consciousness
again
like
the
bite
of
a
dentist
drill
only
wanted
to
look
at
the
moon
he
mimicked
her
in
falsetto
only
wanted
to
die
like
a
little
fool
and
make
me
that
much
more
ashamed
of
you
then
his
voice
went
gruff
and
professional
here
count
yourself
she
silently
took
the
geiger
counter
he
held
at
arm
length
waited
until
it
settled
down
to
a
steady
ticking
slower
than
a
clock
due
only
to
cosmic
rays
and
indicating
nothing
dangerous
and
then
began
to
comb
her
body
with
the
instrument
first
her
head
and
shoulders
then
out
along
her
arms
and
back
along
their
under
side
there
was
something
oddly
voluptuous
about
her
movements
although
her
features
were
gray
and
sagging
the
ticking
did
not
change
its
tempo
until
she
came
to
her
waist
then
it
suddenly
spurted
clicking
faster
and
faster
her
husband
gave
an
excited
grunt
took
a
quick
step
forward
froze
she
goggled
for
a
moment
in
fear
then
grinned
foolishly
dug
in
the
pocket
of
her
grimy
apron
and
guiltily
pulled
out
a
wristwatch
he
grabbed
it
as
it
dangled
from
her
fingers
saw
that
it
had
a
radium
dial
cursed
heaved
it
up
as
if
to
smash
it
on
the
floor
but
instead
put
it
carefully
on
the
table
you
imbecile
you
incredible
imbecile
he
softly
chanted
to
himself
through
clenched
teeth
with
eyes
half
closed
she
shrugged
faintly
put
the
geiger
counter
on
the
table
and
stood
there
slumped
he
waited
until
the
chanting
had
soothed
his
anger
before
speaking
again
he
said
quietly
i
do
suppose
you
still
realize
the
sort
of
world
you
living
in
she
nodded
slowly
staring
at
nothingness
oh
she
realized
all
right
realized
only
too
well
it
was
the
world
that
had
realized
the
world
that
had
gone
on
stockpiling
hydrogen
bombs
the
world
that
had
put
those
bombs
in
cobalt
shells
although
it
had
promised
it
would
because
the
cobalt
made
them
much
more
terrible
and
cost
no
more
the
world
that
had
started
throwing
those
bombs
always
telling
itself
that
it
had
thrown
enough
of
them
yet
to
make
the
air
really
dangerous
with
the
deadly
radioactive
dust
that
came
from
the
cobalt
thrown
them
and
kept
on
throwing
until
the
danger
point
where
air
and
ground
would
become
fatal
to
all
human
life
was
approached
then
for
about
a
month
the
two
great
enemy
groups
had
hesitated
and
then
each
unknown
to
the
other
had
decided
it
could
risk
one
last
gigantic
and
decisive
attack
without
exceeding
the
danger
point
it
had
been
planned
to
strip
off
the
cobalt
cases
but
someone
forgot
and
then
there
was
time
besides
the
military
scientists
of
each
group
were
confident
that
the
lands
of
the
other
had
got
the
most
dust
the
two
attacks
came
within
an
hour
of
each
other
after
that
the
fury
the
fury
of
doomed
men
who
think
only
of
taking
with
them
as
many
as
possible
of
the
enemy
and
in
this
case
they
hoped
all
the
fury
of
suicides
who
know
they
have
botched
up
life
for
good
the
fury
of
cocksure
men
who
realize
they
have
been
outsmarted
by
fate
the
enemy
and
themselves
and
know
that
they
will
never
be
able
to
improvise
a
defense
when
arraigned
before
the
high
court
of
history
and
whose
unadmitted
hope
is
that
there
will
be
no
high
court
of
history
left
to
arraign
them
more
cobalt
bombs
were
dropped
during
the
fury
than
in
all
the
preceding
years
of
the
war
after
the
fury
the
terror
men
and
women
with
death
sifting
into
their
bones
through
their
nostrils
and
skin
fighting
for
bare
survival
under
a
sky
that
played
fantastic
tricks
with
the
light
of
sun
and
moon
like
the
dust
from
krakatoa
that
drifted
around
the
world
for
years
cities
countryside
and
air
were
alike
poisoned
alive
with
deadly
radiation
the
only
realistic
chance
for
continued
existence
was
to
retire
for
the
five
or
ten
years
the
radiation
would
remain
deadly
to
some
and
place
that
must
also
be
copiously
supplied
with
food
water
power
and
a
means
of
such
places
were
prepared
by
the
seized
by
the
stronger
defended
by
them
in
turn
against
the
desperate
hordes
of
the
dying
until
there
were
no
more
of
those
after
that
only
the
waiting
the
enduring
a
mole
existence
without
beauty
or
tenderness
but
with
fear
and
guilt
as
constant
companions
never
to
see
the
sun
to
walk
among
the
trees
or
even
know
if
there
were
still
trees
oh
yes
she
realized
what
the
world
was
like
you
understand
too
i
suppose
that
we
were
allowed
to
reclaim
this
apartment
only
because
the
committee
believed
us
to
be
responsible
people
and
because
i
been
making
a
damn
good
showing
lately
yes
hank
i
thought
you
were
eager
for
privacy
you
want
to
go
back
to
the
basement
tenements
no
anything
rather
than
that
fetid
huddling
that
shameless
communal
sprawl
and
yet
was
this
so
much
better
the
nearness
to
the
surface
was
meaningless
it
only
tantalized
and
the
privacy
magnified
she
shook
her
head
dutifully
and
said
no
hank
then
why
are
you
careful
i
told
you
a
million
times
effie
that
glass
is
no
protection
against
the
dust
that
outside
that
window
the
lead
shutter
must
never
be
touched
if
you
make
one
single
slip
like
that
and
it
gets
around
the
committee
will
send
us
back
to
the
lower
levels
without
blinking
an
eye
and
they
think
twice
before
trusting
me
with
any
important
jobs
i
sorry
hank
sorry
what
the
good
of
being
sorry
the
only
thing
that
counts
is
never
to
make
a
slip
why
the
devil
do
you
do
such
things
effie
what
drives
you
to
it
she
swallowed
it
just
that
it
so
dreadful
being
cooped
up
like
this
she
said
hesitatingly
shut
away
from
the
sky
and
the
sun
just
hungry
for
a
little
beauty
and
do
you
suppose
i
not
he
demanded
do
you
suppose
i
want
to
get
outside
too
and
be
carefree
and
have
a
good
time
but
i
not
so
damn
selfish
about
it
i
want
my
children
to
enjoy
the
sun
and
my
children
children
do
you
see
that
that
the
thing
and
that
we
have
to
behave
like
mature
adults
and
make
sacrifices
for
it
yes
hank
he
surveyed
her
slumped
figure
her
lined
and
listless
face
you
a
fine
one
to
talk
about
hunger
for
beauty
he
told
her
then
his
voice
grew
softer
more
deliberate
you
have
forgotten
have
you
effie
that
until
last
month
the
committee
was
so
concerned
about
your
sterility
that
they
were
about
to
enter
my
name
on
the
list
of
those
waiting
to
be
allotted
a
free
woman
very
high
on
the
list
too
she
could
nod
even
at
that
one
but
not
while
looking
at
him
she
turned
away
she
knew
very
well
that
the
committee
was
justified
in
worrying
about
the
birth
rate
when
the
community
finally
moved
back
to
the
surface
again
each
additional
healthy
young
person
would
be
an
asset
not
only
in
the
struggle
for
bare
survival
but
in
the
resumed
war
against
communism
which
some
of
the
committee
members
still
counted
on
it
was
natural
that
they
should
view
a
sterile
woman
with
disfavor
and
not
only
because
of
the
waste
of
her
husband
but
because
sterility
might
indicate
that
she
had
suffered
more
than
the
average
from
radiation
in
that
case
if
she
did
bear
children
later
on
they
would
be
more
apt
to
carry
a
defective
heredity
producing
an
undue
number
of
monsters
and
freaks
in
future
generations
and
so
contaminating
the
race
of
course
she
understood
it
she
could
hardly
remember
the
time
when
she
did
years
ago
centuries
there
was
much
difference
in
a
place
where
time
was
endless
his
lecture
finished
her
husband
smiled
and
grew
almost
cheerful
now
that
you
going
to
have
a
child
that
all
in
the
background
again
do
you
know
effie
that
when
i
first
came
in
i
had
some
very
good
news
for
you
i
to
become
a
member
of
the
junior
committee
and
the
announcement
will
be
made
at
the
banquet
tonight
he
cut
short
her
mumbled
congratulations
so
brighten
yourself
up
and
put
on
your
best
dress
i
want
the
other
juniors
to
see
what
a
handsome
wife
the
new
member
has
got
he
paused
well
get
a
move
on
she
spoke
with
difficulty
still
not
looking
at
him
i
terribly
sorry
hank
but
you
have
to
go
alone
i
not
well
he
straightened
up
with
an
indignant
jerk
there
you
go
again
first
that
infantile
inexcusable
business
of
the
shutters
and
now
this
no
feeling
for
my
reputation
at
all
do
be
ridiculous
effie
coming
terribly
sorry
she
repeated
blindly
but
i
really
ca
i
just
be
sick
i
would
make
you
proud
of
me
at
all
of
course
you
wo
he
retorted
sharply
as
it
is
i
have
to
spend
half
my
energy
running
around
making
excuses
for
you
why
you
so
odd
why
you
always
seem
to
be
ailing
why
you
always
stupid
and
snobbish
and
say
the
wrong
thing
but
tonight
really
important
effie
it
will
cause
a
lot
of
bad
comment
if
the
new
member
wife
is
present
you
know
how
just
a
hint
of
sickness
starts
the
old
rumor
going
you
to
come
effie
she
shook
her
head
helplessly
oh
for
heaven
sake
come
on
he
shouted
advancing
on
her
this
is
just
a
silly
mood
as
soon
as
you
get
going
you
snap
out
of
it
there
nothing
really
wrong
with
you
at
all
he
put
his
hand
on
her
shoulder
to
turn
her
around
and
at
his
touch
her
face
suddenly
grew
so
desperate
and
gray
that
for
a
moment
he
was
alarmed
in
spite
of
himself
really
he
asked
almost
with
a
note
of
concern
she
nodded
miserably
hmm
he
stepped
back
and
strode
about
irresolutely
well
of
course
if
that
the
way
it
is
he
checked
himself
and
a
sad
smile
crossed
his
face
so
you
do
care
enough
about
your
old
husband
success
to
make
one
supreme
effort
in
spite
of
feeling
bad
again
the
helpless
headshake
i
just
ca
go
out
tonight
under
any
circumstances
and
her
gaze
stole
toward
the
lead
shutters
he
was
about
to
say
something
when
he
caught
the
direction
of
her
gaze
his
eyebrows
jumped
for
seconds
he
stared
at
her
incredulously
as
if
some
completely
new
and
almost
unbelievable
possibility
had
popped
into
his
mind
the
look
of
incredulity
slowly
faded
to
be
replaced
by
a
harder
more
calculating
expression
but
when
he
spoke
again
his
voice
was
shockingly
bright
and
kind
well
it
ca
be
helped
naturally
and
i
certainly
would
want
you
to
go
if
you
were
able
to
enjoy
it
so
you
hop
right
into
bed
and
get
a
good
rest
i
run
over
to
the
men
dorm
to
freshen
up
no
really
i
do
want
you
to
have
to
make
any
effort
at
all
incidentally
jim
barnes
is
going
to
be
able
to
come
to
the
banquet
either
touch
of
the
old
he
tells
me
of
all
things
he
watched
her
closely
as
he
mentioned
the
other
man
name
but
she
did
react
noticeably
in
fact
she
hardly
seemed
to
be
hearing
his
chatter
i
got
a
bit
sharp
with
you
i
afraid
effie
he
continued
contritely
i
sorry
about
that
i
was
excited
about
my
new
job
and
i
guess
that
was
why
things
upset
me
made
me
feel
let
down
when
i
found
you
were
feeling
as
good
as
i
was
selfish
of
me
now
you
get
into
bed
right
away
and
get
well
do
worry
about
me
a
bit
i
know
come
if
you
possibly
could
and
i
know
you
be
thinking
about
me
well
i
must
be
off
now
he
started
toward
her
as
if
to
embrace
her
then
seemed
to
think
better
of
it
he
turned
back
at
the
doorway
and
said
emphasizing
the
words
you
be
completely
alone
for
the
next
four
hours
he
waited
for
her
nod
then
bounced
out
she
stood
still
until
his
footsteps
died
away
then
she
straightened
up
walked
over
to
where
he
put
down
the
wristwatch
picked
it
up
and
smashed
it
hard
on
the
floor
the
crystal
shattered
the
case
flew
apart
and
something
went
she
stood
there
breathing
heavily
slowly
her
sagged
features
lifted
formed
themselves
into
the
beginning
of
a
smile
she
stole
another
look
at
the
shutters
the
smile
became
more
definite
she
felt
her
hair
wet
her
fingers
and
ran
them
along
her
hairline
and
back
over
her
ears
after
wiping
her
hands
on
her
apron
she
took
it
off
she
straightened
her
dress
lifted
her
head
with
a
little
flourish
and
stepped
smartly
toward
the
window
then
her
face
went
miserable
again
and
her
steps
slowed
no
it
could
be
and
it
wo
be
she
told
herself
it
had
been
just
an
illusion
a
silly
romantic
dream
that
she
had
somehow
projected
out
of
her
mind
and
given
a
moment
false
reality
there
could
be
anything
alive
outside
there
had
been
for
two
whole
years
and
if
there
conceivably
were
it
would
be
something
altogether
horrible
she
remembered
some
of
the
pariahs
hairless
witless
creatures
with
radiation
welts
crawling
over
their
bodies
like
worms
who
had
come
begging
for
succor
during
the
last
months
of
the
terror
and
been
shot
down
how
they
must
have
hated
the
people
in
refuges
but
even
as
she
was
thinking
these
things
her
fingers
were
caressing
the
bolts
gingerly
drawing
them
and
she
was
opening
the
shutters
gently
apprehensively
no
there
could
be
anything
outside
she
assured
herself
wryly
peering
out
into
the
green
night
even
her
fears
had
been
groundless
but
the
face
came
floating
up
toward
the
window
she
started
back
in
terror
then
checked
herself
for
the
face
was
horrible
at
all
only
very
thin
with
full
lips
and
large
eyes
and
a
thin
proud
nose
like
the
jutting
beak
of
a
bird
and
no
radiation
welts
or
scars
marred
the
skin
olive
in
the
tempered
moonlight
it
looked
in
fact
just
as
it
had
when
she
had
seen
it
the
first
time
for
a
long
moment
the
face
stared
deep
deep
into
her
brain
then
the
full
lips
smiled
and
a
hand
materialized
itself
from
the
green
darkness
and
rapped
twice
on
the
grimy
pane
her
heart
pounding
she
furiously
worked
the
little
crank
that
opened
the
window
it
came
unstuck
from
the
frame
with
a
tiny
explosion
of
dust
and
a
like
that
of
the
watch
only
louder
a
moment
later
it
swung
open
wide
and
a
puff
of
incredibly
fresh
air
caressed
her
face
and
the
inside
of
her
nostrils
stinging
her
eyes
with
unanticipated
tears
the
man
outside
balanced
on
the
sill
crouching
like
a
faun
head
high
one
elbow
on
knee
he
was
dressed
in
scarred
snug
trousers
and
an
old
sweater
is
it
tears
i
get
for
a
welcome
he
mocked
her
gently
in
a
musical
voice
or
are
those
only
to
greet
god
own
breath
the
air
he
swung
down
inside
and
now
she
could
see
he
was
tall
turning
he
snapped
his
fingers
and
called
come
puss
a
black
cat
with
a
twisted
stump
of
a
tail
and
feet
like
small
boxing
gloves
and
ears
almost
as
big
as
rabbits
hopped
clumsily
in
view
he
lifted
it
down
gave
it
a
pat
then
nodding
familiarly
to
effie
he
unstrapped
a
little
pack
from
his
back
and
laid
it
on
the
table
she
could
move
she
even
found
it
hard
to
breathe
the
window
she
finally
managed
to
get
out
he
looked
at
her
inquiringly
caught
the
direction
of
her
stabbing
finger
moving
without
haste
he
went
over
and
closed
it
carelessly
the
shutters
too
she
told
him
but
he
ignored
that
looking
around
it
a
snug
enough
place
you
and
your
man
have
he
commented
or
is
it
that
this
is
a
town
or
a
harem
spot
or
just
a
military
post
he
checked
her
before
she
could
answer
but
let
not
be
talking
about
such
things
now
soon
enough
i
be
scared
to
death
for
both
of
us
best
enjoy
the
kick
of
meeting
which
is
always
good
for
twenty
minutes
at
the
least
he
smiled
at
her
rather
shyly
have
you
food
good
then
bring
it
she
set
cold
meat
and
some
precious
canned
bread
before
him
and
had
water
heating
for
coffee
before
he
fell
to
he
shredded
a
chunk
of
meat
and
put
it
on
the
floor
for
the
cat
which
left
off
its
sniffing
inspection
of
the
walls
and
ran
up
eagerly
mewing
then
the
man
began
to
eat
chewing
each
mouthful
slowly
and
appreciatively
from
across
the
table
effie
watched
him
drinking
in
his
every
deft
movement
his
every
cryptic
quirk
of
expression
she
attended
to
making
the
coffee
but
that
took
only
a
moment
finally
she
could
contain
herself
no
longer
what
it
like
up
there
she
asked
breathlessly
outside
i
mean
he
looked
at
her
oddly
for
quite
a
space
finally
he
said
flatly
oh
it
a
wonderland
for
sure
more
amazing
than
you
tombed
folk
could
ever
imagine
a
veritable
fairyland
and
he
quickly
went
on
eating
no
but
really
she
pressed
noting
her
eagerness
he
smiled
and
his
eyes
filled
with
playful
tenderness
i
mean
it
on
my
oath
he
assured
her
you
think
the
bombs
and
the
dust
made
only
death
and
ugliness
that
was
true
at
first
but
then
just
as
the
doctors
foretold
they
changed
the
life
in
the
seeds
and
loins
that
were
brave
enough
to
stay
wonders
bloomed
and
walked
he
broke
off
suddenly
and
asked
do
any
of
you
ever
venture
outside
a
few
of
the
men
are
allowed
to
she
told
him
for
short
trips
in
special
protective
suits
to
hunt
for
canned
food
and
fuels
and
batteries
and
things
like
that
aye
and
those
slugs
would
never
see
anything
but
what
they
looking
for
he
said
nodding
bitterly
they
never
see
the
garden
where
a
dozen
buds
blossom
where
one
did
before
and
the
flowers
have
petals
a
yard
across
with
stingless
bees
big
as
sparrows
gently
supping
their
nectar
housecats
grown
spotted
and
huge
as
leopards
not
little
runts
like
joe
louis
here
stalk
through
those
gardens
but
they
gentle
beasts
no
more
harmful
than
the
snakes
that
glide
around
their
paws
for
the
dust
burned
all
the
murder
out
of
them
as
it
burned
itself
out
i
even
made
up
a
little
poem
about
that
it
starts
can
hurt
me
or
water
or
the
weight
of
earth
but
the
dust
is
my
friend
oh
yes
and
then
the
robins
like
cockatoos
and
squirrels
like
a
ermine
all
under
a
treasure
chest
of
sun
and
moon
and
stars
that
the
dust
magic
powder
changes
from
ruby
to
emerald
and
sapphire
and
amethyst
and
back
again
oh
and
then
the
new
children
you
telling
the
truth
she
interrupted
him
her
eyes
brimming
with
tears
you
not
making
it
up
i
am
not
he
assured
her
solemnly
and
if
you
could
catch
a
glimpse
of
one
of
the
new
children
you
never
doubt
me
again
they
have
long
limbs
as
brown
as
this
coffee
would
be
if
it
had
lots
of
fresh
cream
in
it
and
smiling
delicate
faces
and
the
whitish
teeth
and
the
finest
hair
they
so
nimble
that
i
a
sprightly
man
and
somewhat
enlivened
by
the
dust
feel
like
a
cripple
beside
them
and
their
thoughts
dance
like
flames
and
make
me
feel
a
very
imbecile
of
course
they
have
seven
fingers
on
each
hand
and
eight
toes
on
each
foot
but
they
the
more
beautiful
for
that
they
have
large
pointed
ears
that
the
sun
shines
through
they
play
in
the
garden
all
day
long
slipping
among
the
great
leaves
and
blooms
but
they
so
swift
that
you
can
hardly
see
them
unless
one
chooses
to
stand
still
and
look
at
you
for
that
matter
you
have
to
look
a
bit
hard
for
all
these
things
i
telling
you
but
it
is
true
she
pleaded
every
word
of
it
he
said
looking
straight
into
her
eyes
he
put
down
his
knife
and
fork
what
your
name
he
asked
softly
patrick
effie
she
told
him
he
shook
his
head
that
ca
be
he
said
then
his
face
brightened
euphemia
he
exclaimed
that
what
effie
is
short
for
your
name
is
euphemia
as
he
said
that
looking
at
her
she
suddenly
felt
beautiful
he
got
up
and
came
around
the
table
and
stretched
out
his
hand
toward
her
euphemia
he
began
yes
she
answered
huskily
shrinking
from
him
a
little
but
looking
up
sideways
and
very
flushed
do
either
of
you
move
hank
said
the
voice
was
flat
and
nasal
because
hank
was
wearing
a
nose
respirator
that
was
just
long
enough
to
suggest
an
elephant
trunk
in
his
right
hand
was
a
large
automatic
pistol
they
turned
their
faces
to
him
patrick
was
abruptly
alert
shifty
but
effie
was
still
smiling
tenderly
as
if
hank
could
not
break
the
spell
of
the
magic
garden
and
should
be
pitied
for
not
knowing
about
it
you
little
hank
began
with
an
almost
gleeful
fury
calling
her
several
shameful
names
he
spoke
in
short
phrases
closing
tight
his
unmasked
mouth
between
them
while
he
sucked
in
breath
through
the
respirator
his
voice
rose
in
a
crescendo
and
not
with
a
man
of
the
community
but
a
pariah
pariah
i
hardly
know
what
you
thinking
man
but
you
quite
wrong
patrick
took
the
opportunity
to
put
in
hurriedly
conciliatingly
i
just
happened
to
be
coming
by
hungry
tonight
a
lonely
tramp
and
knocked
at
the
window
your
wife
was
a
bit
foolish
and
let
kindheartedness
get
the
better
of
prudence
do
think
you
pulled
the
wool
over
my
eyes
effie
hank
went
on
with
a
screechy
laugh
disregarding
the
other
man
completely
think
i
do
know
why
you
suddenly
going
to
have
a
child
after
four
long
years
at
that
moment
the
cat
came
nosing
up
to
his
feet
patrick
watched
him
narrowly
shifting
his
weight
forward
a
little
but
hank
only
kicked
the
animal
aside
without
taking
his
eyes
off
them
even
that
business
of
carrying
the
wristwatch
in
your
pocket
instead
of
on
your
arm
he
went
on
with
channeled
hysteria
a
neat
bit
of
camouflage
effie
very
neat
and
telling
me
it
was
my
child
when
all
the
while
you
been
seeing
him
for
months
man
you
mad
i
not
touched
her
patrick
denied
hotly
though
still
calculatingly
and
risked
a
step
forward
stopping
when
the
gun
instantly
swung
his
way
pretending
you
were
going
to
give
me
a
healthy
child
hank
raved
on
when
all
the
while
you
knew
it
would
be
either
in
body
or
germ
plasm
a
thing
like
he
waved
his
gun
at
the
malformed
cat
which
had
leaped
to
the
top
of
the
table
and
was
eating
the
remains
of
patrick
food
though
its
watchful
green
eyes
were
fixed
on
hank
i
should
shoot
him
down
hank
yelled
between
sobbing
inhalations
through
the
mask
i
should
kill
him
this
instant
for
the
contaminated
pariah
he
is
all
this
while
effie
had
not
ceased
to
smile
compassionately
now
she
stood
up
without
haste
and
went
to
patrick
side
disregarding
his
warning
apprehensive
glance
she
put
her
arm
lightly
around
him
and
faced
her
husband
then
you
be
killing
the
bringer
of
the
best
news
we
ever
had
she
said
and
her
voice
was
like
a
flood
of
some
warm
sweet
liquor
in
that
musty
room
oh
hank
forget
your
silly
wrong
jealousy
and
listen
to
me
patrick
here
has
something
wonderful
to
tell
us
hank
stared
at
her
for
once
he
screamed
no
reply
it
was
obvious
that
he
was
seeing
for
the
first
time
how
beautiful
she
had
become
and
that
the
realization
jolted
him
terribly
what
do
you
mean
he
finally
asked
unevenly
almost
fearfully
i
mean
that
we
no
longer
need
to
fear
the
dust
she
said
and
now
her
smile
was
radiant
it
never
really
did
hurt
people
the
way
the
doctors
said
it
would
remember
how
it
was
with
me
hank
the
exposure
i
had
and
recovered
from
although
the
doctors
said
i
would
at
first
and
without
even
losing
my
hair
hank
those
who
were
brave
enough
to
stay
outside
and
who
were
killed
by
terror
and
suggestion
and
panic
they
adapted
to
the
dust
they
changed
but
they
changed
for
the
better
everything
effie
he
told
you
lies
hank
interrupted
but
still
in
that
same
agitated
broken
voice
cowed
by
her
beauty
everything
that
grew
or
moved
was
purified
she
went
on
ringingly
you
men
going
outside
have
never
seen
it
because
you
never
had
eyes
for
it
you
been
blinded
to
beauty
to
life
itself
and
now
all
the
power
in
the
dust
has
gone
and
faded
anyway
burned
itself
out
true
is
it
she
smiled
at
patrick
for
confirmation
his
face
was
strangely
veiled
as
if
he
were
calculating
obscure
changes
he
might
have
given
a
little
nod
at
any
rate
effie
assumed
that
he
did
for
she
turned
back
to
her
husband
you
see
hank
we
can
all
go
out
now
we
need
never
fear
the
dust
again
patrick
is
a
living
proof
of
that
she
continued
triumphantly
standing
straighter
holding
him
a
little
tighter
look
at
him
not
a
scar
or
a
sign
and
he
been
out
in
the
dust
for
years
how
could
he
be
this
way
if
the
dust
hurt
the
brave
oh
believe
me
hank
believe
what
you
see
test
it
if
you
want
test
patrick
here
effie
you
all
mixed
up
you
do
know
hank
faltered
but
without
conviction
of
any
sort
just
test
him
effie
repeated
with
utter
confidence
ignoring
not
even
noticing
patrick
warning
nudge
all
right
hank
mumbled
he
looked
at
the
stranger
dully
can
you
count
he
asked
patrick
face
was
a
complete
enigma
then
he
suddenly
spoke
and
his
voice
was
like
a
fencer
foil
light
bright
alert
constantly
playing
yet
utterly
on
guard
can
i
count
do
you
take
me
for
a
complete
simpleton
man
of
course
i
can
count
then
count
yourself
hank
said
barely
indicating
the
table
count
myself
should
i
the
other
retorted
with
a
quick
facetious
laugh
is
this
a
kindergarten
but
if
you
want
me
to
i
willing
his
voice
was
rapid
i
two
arms
and
two
legs
that
four
and
ten
fingers
and
ten
toes
you
take
my
word
for
them
that
a
head
and
two
eyes
and
a
nose
and
a
mouth
with
this
i
mean
hank
said
heavily
advanced
to
the
table
picked
up
the
geiger
counter
switched
it
on
and
handed
it
across
the
table
to
the
other
man
but
while
it
was
still
an
arm
length
from
patrick
the
clicks
began
to
mount
furiously
until
they
were
like
the
chatter
of
a
pigmy
machine
gun
abruptly
the
clicks
slowed
but
that
was
only
the
counter
shifting
to
a
new
scaling
circuit
in
which
each
click
stood
for
of
the
old
ones
with
those
horrid
rattling
little
volleys
fear
cascaded
into
the
room
and
filled
it
smashing
like
so
much
colored
glass
all
the
bright
barriers
of
words
effie
had
raised
against
it
for
no
dreams
can
stand
against
the
geiger
counter
the
twentieth
century
mouthpiece
of
ultimate
truth
it
was
as
if
the
dust
and
all
the
terrors
of
the
dust
had
incarnated
themselves
in
one
dread
invading
shape
that
said
in
words
stronger
than
audible
speech
those
were
illusions
whistles
in
the
dark
this
is
reality
the
dreary
pitiless
reality
of
the
burrowing
years
hank
scuttled
back
to
the
wall
through
chattering
teeth
he
babbled
enough
radioactives
kill
a
thousand
men
freak
a
freak
in
his
agitation
he
forgot
for
a
moment
to
inhale
through
the
respirator
even
effie
taken
off
guard
all
the
fears
that
had
been
drilled
into
her
twanging
like
piano
wires
shrank
from
the
shape
beside
her
held
herself
to
it
only
by
desperation
patrick
did
it
for
her
he
disengaged
her
arm
and
stepped
briskly
away
then
he
whirled
on
them
smiling
sardonically
and
started
to
speak
but
instead
looked
with
distaste
at
the
chattering
geiger
counter
he
held
between
fingers
and
thumb
have
we
listened
to
this
racket
long
enough
he
asked
without
waiting
for
an
answer
he
put
down
the
instrument
on
the
table
the
cat
hurried
over
to
it
curiously
and
the
clicks
began
again
to
mount
in
a
minor
crescendo
effie
lunged
for
it
frantically
switched
it
off
darted
back
that
right
patrick
said
with
another
chilling
smile
you
do
well
to
cringe
for
i
death
itself
even
in
death
i
could
kill
you
like
a
snake
and
with
that
his
voice
took
on
the
tones
of
a
circus
barker
yes
i
a
freak
as
the
gentleman
so
wisely
said
that
what
one
doctor
who
dared
talk
with
me
for
a
minute
told
me
before
he
kicked
me
out
he
could
tell
me
why
but
somehow
the
dust
does
kill
me
because
i
a
freak
you
see
just
like
the
men
who
ate
nails
and
walked
on
fire
and
ate
arsenic
and
stuck
themselves
through
with
pins
step
right
up
ladies
and
gentlemen
only
not
too
close
and
examine
the
man
the
dust
ca
harm
rappaccini
child
brought
up
to
date
his
embrace
death
and
now
he
said
breathing
heavily
i
get
out
and
leave
you
in
your
damned
lead
cave
he
started
toward
the
window
hank
gun
followed
him
shakingly
wait
effie
called
in
an
agonized
voice
he
obeyed
she
continued
falteringly
when
we
were
together
earlier
you
did
act
as
if
when
we
were
together
earlier
i
wanted
what
i
wanted
he
snarled
at
her
you
do
suppose
i
a
bloody
saint
do
you
and
all
the
beautiful
things
you
told
me
that
he
said
cruelly
is
just
a
line
i
found
that
women
fall
for
they
all
so
bored
and
so
starved
for
beauty
as
generally
put
it
even
the
garden
her
question
was
barely
audible
through
the
sobs
that
threatened
to
suffocate
her
he
looked
at
her
and
perhaps
his
expression
softened
just
a
trifle
what
outside
he
said
flatly
is
just
a
little
worse
than
either
of
you
can
imagine
he
tapped
his
temple
the
garden
all
here
you
killed
it
she
wept
you
killed
it
in
me
you
both
killed
everything
that
beautiful
but
you
worse
she
screamed
at
patrick
because
he
only
killed
beauty
once
but
you
brought
it
to
life
just
so
you
could
kill
it
again
oh
i
ca
stand
it
i
wo
stand
it
and
she
began
to
scream
patrick
started
toward
her
but
she
broke
off
and
whirled
away
from
him
to
the
window
her
eyes
crazy
you
been
lying
to
us
she
cried
the
garden
there
i
know
it
is
but
you
do
want
to
share
it
with
anyone
illustration
no
no
euphemia
patrick
protested
anxiously
it
hell
out
there
believe
me
i
would
lie
to
you
about
it
would
lie
to
me
she
mocked
are
you
afraid
too
with
a
sudden
pull
she
jerked
open
the
window
and
stood
before
the
blank
oblong
of
darkness
that
seemed
to
press
into
the
room
like
a
menacing
heavy
curtain
at
that
hank
cried
out
a
shocked
pleading
effie
she
ignored
him
i
ca
be
cooped
up
here
any
longer
she
said
and
i
wo
now
that
i
know
i
going
to
the
garden
both
men
sprang
at
her
but
they
were
too
late
she
leaped
lightly
to
the
sill
and
by
the
time
they
had
flung
themselves
against
it
her
footsteps
were
already
hurrying
off
into
the
darkness
effie
come
back
come
back
hank
shouted
after
her
desperately
no
longer
thinking
to
cringe
from
the
man
beside
him
or
how
the
gun
was
pointed
i
love
you
effie
come
back
patrick
added
his
voice
come
back
euphemia
you
be
safe
if
you
come
back
right
away
come
back
to
your
home
no
answer
to
that
at
all
they
both
strained
their
eyes
through
the
greenish
murk
they
could
barely
make
out
a
shadowy
figure
about
half
a
block
down
the
canyon
of
the
dismal
street
into
which
the
greenish
moonlight
hardly
reached
it
seemed
to
them
that
the
figure
was
scooping
something
up
from
the
pavement
and
letting
it
sift
down
along
its
arms
and
over
its
bosom
go
out
and
get
her
man
patrick
urged
the
other
for
if
i
go
out
for
her
i
warn
you
i
wo
bring
her
back
she
said
something
about
having
stood
the
dust
better
than
most
and
that
enough
for
me
but
hank
chained
by
his
painfully
learned
habits
and
by
something
else
could
not
move
and
then
a
ghostly
voice
came
whispering
down
the
street
chanting
fire
can
hurt
me
or
water
or
the
weight
of
earth
but
the
dust
is
my
friend
patrick
spared
the
other
man
one
more
look
then
without
a
word
he
vaulted
up
and
ran
off
hank
stood
there
after
perhaps
a
half
minute
he
remembered
to
close
his
mouth
when
he
inhaled
finally
he
was
sure
the
street
was
empty
as
he
started
to
close
the
window
there
was
a
little
he
picked
up
the
cat
and
gently
put
it
outside
then
he
did
close
the
window
and
the
shutters
and
bolted
them
and
took
up
the
geiger
counter
and
mechanically
began
to
count
himself
