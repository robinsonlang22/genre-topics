dialogue
introduction
lucian
in
greek
loukianos
was
a
syrian
born
about
the
year
at
samosata
where
a
bend
of
the
euphrates
brings
that
river
nearest
to
the
borders
of
cilicia
in
asia
minor
he
had
in
him
by
nature
a
quick
flow
of
wit
with
a
bent
towards
greek
literature
it
was
thought
at
home
that
he
showed
as
a
boy
the
artist
nature
by
his
skill
in
making
little
waxen
images
an
uncle
on
his
mother
side
happened
to
be
a
sculptor
the
home
was
poor
lucian
would
have
his
bread
to
earn
and
when
he
was
fourteen
he
was
apprenticed
to
his
uncle
that
he
might
learn
to
become
a
sculptor
before
long
while
polishing
a
marble
tablet
he
pressed
on
it
too
heavily
and
broke
it
his
uncle
thrashed
him
lucian
spirit
rebelled
and
he
went
home
giving
the
comic
reason
that
his
uncle
beat
him
because
jealous
of
the
extraordinary
power
he
showed
in
his
art
after
some
debate
lucian
abandoned
training
as
a
sculptor
studied
literature
and
rhetoric
and
qualified
himself
for
the
career
of
an
advocate
and
teacher
at
a
time
when
rhetoric
had
still
a
chief
place
in
the
schools
he
practised
for
a
short
time
unsuccessfully
at
antioch
and
then
travelled
for
the
cultivation
of
his
mind
in
greece
italy
and
gaul
making
his
way
by
use
of
his
wits
as
goldsmith
did
long
afterwards
when
he
started
at
the
outset
also
of
his
career
as
a
writer
on
a
grand
tour
of
the
continent
with
nothing
in
his
pocket
lucian
earned
as
he
went
by
public
use
of
his
skill
as
a
rhetorician
his
travel
was
not
unlike
the
modern
american
lecturing
tour
made
also
for
the
money
it
may
bring
and
for
the
new
experience
acquired
by
it
lucian
stayed
long
enough
in
athens
to
acquire
a
mastery
of
attic
greek
and
his
public
discourses
could
not
have
been
without
full
seasoning
of
attic
salt
in
italy
and
gaul
his
success
brought
him
money
beyond
his
present
needs
and
he
went
back
to
samosata
when
about
forty
years
old
able
to
choose
and
follow
his
own
course
in
life
he
then
ceased
to
be
a
professional
talker
and
became
a
writer
bold
and
witty
against
everything
that
seemed
to
him
to
want
foundation
for
the
honour
that
it
claimed
he
attacked
the
gods
of
greece
and
the
whole
system
of
mythology
when
in
its
second
century
the
christian
church
was
ready
to
replace
the
forms
of
heathen
worship
he
laughed
at
the
philosophers
confounding
together
in
one
censure
deep
conviction
with
shallow
convention
his
vigorous
winnowing
sent
chaff
to
the
winds
but
not
without
some
scattering
of
wheat
delight
in
the
power
of
satire
leads
always
to
some
excess
in
its
use
but
if
the
power
be
used
honestly
and
even
if
it
be
used
recklessly
no
truth
can
be
destroyed
only
the
reckless
use
of
it
breeds
in
minds
of
the
feebler
sort
mere
pleasure
in
ridicule
that
weakens
them
as
helpers
in
the
real
work
of
the
world
and
in
that
way
tends
to
retard
the
forward
movement
but
on
the
whole
ridicule
adds
more
vigour
to
the
strong
than
it
takes
from
the
weak
and
has
its
use
even
when
levelled
against
what
is
good
and
true
in
its
own
way
it
is
a
test
of
truth
and
may
be
fearlessly
applied
to
it
as
jewellers
use
nitric
acid
to
try
gold
if
it
be
uttered
for
gold
and
is
not
gold
let
it
perish
but
if
it
be
true
it
will
stand
trial
the
best
translation
of
the
works
of
lucian
into
english
was
that
by
thomas
francklin
sometime
greek
professor
in
the
university
of
cambridge
which
was
published
in
two
large
quarto
volumes
in
the
year
and
reprinted
in
four
volumes
in
lucian
had
been
translated
before
in
successive
volumes
by
ferrand
spence
and
others
an
edition
completed
in
for
which
dryden
had
written
the
author
life
francklin
who
produced
also
the
best
eighteenth
century
translation
of
sophocles
joined
to
his
translation
of
lucian
a
little
apparatus
of
introductions
and
notes
by
which
the
english
reader
is
often
assisted
and
he
has
skilfully
avoided
the
translation
of
indecencies
which
never
were
of
any
use
and
being
no
longer
sources
of
enjoyment
serve
only
to
exclude
good
wit
with
which
under
different
conditions
of
life
they
were
associated
from
the
welcome
due
to
it
in
all
our
homes
there
is
a
just
and
scholarly
as
well
as
a
meddlesome
and
feeble
way
of
clearing
an
old
writer
from
uncleannesses
that
cause
him
now
to
be
a
name
only
where
he
should
be
a
power
francklin
has
understood
his
work
in
that
way
better
than
bowdler
did
he
does
not
bowdlerise
who
uses
pumice
to
a
blot
but
he
who
rubs
the
copy
into
holes
wherever
he
can
find
an
honest
letter
with
a
downstroke
thicker
than
becomes
a
pen
a
trivial
play
of
fancy
in
one
of
the
pieces
in
this
volume
easily
removed
would
have
been
as
a
dead
fly
in
the
pot
of
ointment
and
would
have
deprived
one
of
lucian
best
works
of
the
currency
to
which
it
is
entitled
lucian
works
are
numerous
and
they
have
been
translated
into
nearly
all
the
languages
of
europe
the
instructions
for
writing
history
was
probably
one
of
the
earliest
pieces
written
by
him
after
lucian
had
settled
down
at
samosata
to
the
free
use
of
his
pen
and
it
has
been
usually
regarded
as
his
best
critical
work
with
ridicule
of
the
affectations
of
historians
whose
names
and
whose
books
have
passed
into
oblivion
he
joins
sound
doctrine
upon
sincerity
of
style
nothing
is
lasting
that
is
feigned
said
ben
jonson
it
will
have
another
face
ere
long
long
after
lucian
day
an
artificial
dignity
accorded
specially
to
work
of
the
historian
bound
him
by
its
conventions
to
an
artificial
style
he
used
as
johnson
said
of
robertson
too
big
words
and
too
many
of
them
but
that
was
said
by
johnson
in
his
latter
days
with
admission
of
like
fault
in
the
convention
to
which
he
had
once
conformed
if
style
is
bad
that
is
to
say
too
big
words
and
too
many
of
them
i
am
afraid
he
caught
it
of
me
lucian
would
have
dealt
as
mercilessly
with
that
later
style
as
archibald
campbell
purser
and
son
of
an
edinburgh
professor
who
used
the
form
of
one
of
lucian
dialogues
lexiphanes
for
an
assault
of
ridicule
upon
pretentious
and
helped
a
little
to
get
rid
of
it
lucian
laughed
in
his
day
at
small
imitators
of
the
manner
of
thucydides
as
he
would
laugh
now
at
the
small
imitators
of
the
manner
of
macaulay
he
bade
the
historian
first
get
sure
facts
then
tell
them
in
due
order
simply
and
without
exaggeration
or
toil
after
fine
writing
though
he
should
aim
not
the
less
at
an
enduring
grace
given
by
nature
to
the
art
that
does
not
stray
from
her
and
simply
speaks
the
highest
truth
it
knows
the
endeavour
of
small
greek
historians
to
add
interest
to
their
work
by
magnifying
the
exploits
of
their
countrymen
and
piling
wonder
upon
wonder
lucian
first
condemned
in
his
instructions
for
writing
history
and
then
caricatured
in
his
true
history
wherein
is
contained
the
account
of
a
trip
to
the
moon
a
piece
which
must
have
been
enjoyed
by
rabelais
which
suggested
to
cyrano
de
bergerac
his
voyages
to
the
moon
and
to
the
sun
and
insensibly
contributed
perhaps
directly
or
through
bergerac
to
the
conception
of
gulliver
travels
i
have
added
the
menippus
because
that
dialogue
describes
another
trip
to
the
moon
though
its
satire
is
more
especially
directed
against
the
philosophers
menippus
was
born
at
gadara
in
and
from
a
slave
he
grew
to
be
a
cynic
philosopher
chiefly
occupied
with
scornful
jests
on
his
neighbours
and
a
who
made
large
gains
and
killed
himself
when
he
was
cheated
of
them
all
he
is
said
to
have
written
thirteen
pieces
which
are
lost
but
he
has
left
his
name
in
literature
preserved
by
important
pieces
that
have
taken
the
name
of
menippean
satire
lucian
married
in
middle
life
and
had
a
son
he
was
about
fifty
years
old
when
he
went
to
paphlagonia
and
visited
a
false
oracle
to
detect
the
tricks
of
an
alexander
who
made
profit
out
of
it
and
who
professed
to
have
a
daughter
by
the
moon
when
the
impostor
offered
lucian
his
hand
to
kiss
lucian
bit
his
thumb
he
also
intervened
to
the
destruction
of
a
profitable
marriage
for
the
daughter
of
the
moon
alexander
lent
lucian
a
vessel
of
his
own
for
the
voyage
onward
and
gave
instructions
to
the
sailors
that
they
were
to
find
a
convenient
time
and
place
for
throwing
their
passenger
into
the
sea
but
when
the
convenient
time
had
come
the
goodwill
of
the
master
of
the
vessel
saved
lucian
life
he
was
landed
therefore
at
aegialos
where
he
found
some
ambassadors
to
eupator
king
of
bithynia
who
took
him
onward
upon
his
way
it
is
believed
that
lucian
lived
to
be
ninety
and
it
is
assumed
since
he
wrote
a
burlesque
drama
on
gout
that
the
cause
of
his
death
was
not
simply
old
age
gout
may
have
been
the
immediate
cause
of
death
lucian
must
have
spent
much
time
at
athens
and
he
held
office
at
one
time
in
his
later
years
as
procurator
of
a
part
of
egypt
the
works
of
lucian
consist
largely
of
dialogues
in
which
he
battled
against
what
he
considered
to
be
false
opinions
by
bringing
the
satire
of
aristophanes
and
the
sarcasm
of
menippus
into
disputations
that
sought
chiefly
to
throw
down
false
idols
before
setting
up
the
true
he
made
many
enemies
by
bold
attacks
upon
the
ancient
faiths
his
earlier
dialogues
of
the
gods
only
brought
out
their
stories
in
a
way
that
made
them
sound
ridiculous
afterwards
he
proceeded
to
direct
attack
on
the
belief
in
them
in
one
dialogue
timocles
a
stoic
argues
for
belief
in
the
old
gods
against
damis
an
epicurean
and
the
gods
in
order
of
dignity
determined
by
the
worth
of
the
material
out
of
which
they
are
made
assemble
to
hear
the
argument
damis
confutes
the
stoic
and
laughs
him
into
fury
zeus
is
unhappy
at
all
this
but
hermes
consoles
him
with
the
reflection
that
although
the
epicurean
may
speak
for
a
few
the
mass
of
greeks
and
all
the
barbarians
remain
true
to
the
ancient
opinions
suidas
who
detested
such
teaching
wrote
a
life
of
him
in
which
he
said
that
lucian
was
at
last
torn
to
pieces
by
dogs
francklin
prefaced
his
edition
with
a
life
written
by
a
friend
in
the
form
of
a
dialogue
of
the
dead
in
the
elysian
fields
between
lord
lyttelton
who
had
been
in
his
dialogues
of
the
dead
an
imitator
of
the
dialogues
so
called
in
lucian
and
lucian
himself
by
that
shambling
gait
and
length
of
carcase
says
lucian
it
must
be
lord
lyttelton
coming
this
way
and
by
that
arch
look
and
sarcastic
smile
says
lyttelton
you
are
my
old
friend
lucian
whom
i
have
not
seen
this
many
a
day
fontenelle
and
i
have
just
now
been
talking
of
you
and
the
obligations
we
both
had
to
our
old
master
i
assure
you
that
there
was
not
a
man
in
all
antiquity
for
whom
whilst
on
earth
i
had
a
greater
regard
than
yourself
after
lucian
has
told
lyttelton
something
about
his
life
his
lordship
thanks
lucian
for
the
little
history
and
says
i
wish
with
all
my
heart
i
could
convey
it
to
a
friend
of
mine
in
the
other
world
meaning
francklin
to
whom
at
this
juncture
it
would
be
of
particular
service
i
mean
a
bold
adventurer
who
has
lately
undertaken
to
give
a
new
and
complete
translation
of
all
your
works
it
is
a
noble
design
but
an
arduous
one
i
own
i
tremble
for
him
lucian
replies
i
heard
of
it
the
other
day
from
goldsmith
who
knew
the
man
i
think
he
may
easily
succeed
in
it
better
than
any
of
his
countrymen
who
hitherto
have
made
but
miserable
work
with
me
nor
do
i
make
a
much
better
appearance
in
my
french
habit
though
that
i
know
has
been
admired
has
made
me
say
a
great
many
things
some
good
some
bad
which
i
never
thought
of
and
upon
the
whole
what
he
has
done
is
more
a
paraphrase
than
a
translation
then
says
lord
lyttelton
all
the
attempts
to
represent
you
at
least
in
our
language
which
i
have
yet
seen
have
failed
and
all
from
the
same
cause
by
the
translator
departing
from
the
original
and
substituting
his
own
manners
phraseology
expression
wit
and
humour
instead
of
yours
nothing
as
it
has
been
observed
by
one
of
our
best
critics
is
so
grave
as
true
humour
and
every
line
of
lucian
is
a
proof
of
it
it
never
laughs
itself
whilst
it
sets
the
table
in
a
roar
a
circumstance
which
these
gentlemen
seem
all
to
have
forgotten
instead
of
the
set
features
and
serious
aspect
which
you
always
wear
when
most
entertaining
they
present
us
for
ever
with
a
broad
grin
and
if
you
have
the
least
smile
upon
your
countenance
make
you
burst
into
a
vulgar
they
are
generally
indeed
such
bad
painters
that
the
daubing
would
never
be
taken
for
you
if
they
had
not
written
under
the
picture
i
heartily
wish
the
doctor
better
luck
upon
which
the
doctor
friend
makes
lucian
reply
and
there
is
some
reason
to
hope
it
for
i
hear
he
has
taken
pains
about
me
has
studied
my
features
well
before
he
sat
down
to
trace
them
on
the
canvas
and
done
it
con
amore
if
he
brings
out
a
good
resemblance
i
shall
excuse
the
want
of
grace
and
beauty
in
his
piece
i
assure
you
i
am
not
without
pleasing
expectation
especially
as
my
friend
sophocles
who
you
know
sat
to
him
some
time
ago
tells
me
though
he
is
no
praxiteles
he
does
not
take
a
bad
likeness
but
i
must
be
gone
for
yonder
come
swift
and
rabelais
whom
i
have
made
a
little
party
with
this
morning
so
my
good
lord
fare
you
well
lucian
had
another
translator
in
who
in
no
way
superseded
francklin
the
reader
of
this
volume
is
reminded
that
the
notes
are
francklin
and
that
any
allusion
in
them
to
a
current
topic
has
to
be
read
as
if
this
present
year
of
grace
were
instructions
for
writing
history
lucian
in
this
letter
to
his
friend
philo
after
having
with
infinite
humour
exposed
the
absurdities
of
some
contemporary
historians
whose
works
being
consigned
to
oblivion
have
never
reached
us
proceeds
in
the
latter
part
of
it
to
lay
down
most
excellent
rules
and
directions
for
writing
history
my
readers
will
find
the
one
to
the
last
degree
pleasant
and
entertaining
and
the
other
no
less
useful
sensible
and
instructive
this
is
indeed
one
of
lucian
best
pieces
my
dear
philo
in
the
reign
of
lysimachus
we
are
told
that
the
people
of
abdera
were
seized
with
a
violent
epidemical
fever
which
raged
through
the
whole
city
continuing
for
seven
days
at
the
expiration
of
which
a
copious
discharge
of
blood
from
the
nostrils
in
some
and
in
others
a
profuse
sweat
carried
it
off
it
was
attended
however
with
a
very
ridiculous
circumstance
every
one
of
the
persons
affected
by
it
being
suddenly
taken
with
a
fit
of
tragedising
spouting
iambics
and
roaring
out
most
furiously
particularly
the
andromeda
of
euripides
and
the
speech
of
perseus
which
they
recited
in
most
lamentable
accents
the
city
swarmed
with
these
pale
patients
who
with
loud
voices
were
perpetually
bawling
out
o
tyrant
love
gods
and
men
supreme
etc
and
this
they
continued
every
day
for
a
long
time
till
winter
and
the
cold
weather
coming
on
put
an
end
to
their
delirium
for
this
disorder
they
seem
in
my
opinion
indebted
to
archelaus
a
tragedian
at
that
time
in
high
estimation
who
in
the
middle
of
summer
at
the
very
hottest
season
of
the
year
exhibited
the
andromeda
which
had
such
an
effect
on
the
spectators
that
several
of
them
as
soon
as
they
rose
up
from
it
fell
insensibly
into
the
tragedising
vein
the
andromeda
naturally
occurring
to
their
memories
and
perseus
with
his
medusa
still
hovering
round
them
now
if
as
they
say
one
may
compare
great
things
with
small
this
abderian
disorder
seems
to
have
seized
on
many
of
our
literati
of
the
present
age
not
that
it
sets
them
on
acting
tragedies
for
the
folly
would
not
be
so
great
in
repeating
other
people
verses
especially
if
they
were
good
ones
but
ever
since
the
war
was
begun
against
the
barbarians
the
defeat
in
armenia
and
the
victories
consequent
on
it
not
one
is
there
amongst
us
who
does
not
write
a
history
or
rather
i
may
say
we
are
all
thucydideses
herodotuses
and
xenophons
well
may
they
say
war
is
the
parent
of
all
things
when
one
action
can
make
so
many
historians
this
puts
me
in
mind
of
what
happened
at
sinope
when
the
corinthians
heard
that
philip
was
going
to
attack
them
they
were
all
alarmed
and
fell
to
work
some
brushing
up
their
arms
others
bringing
stones
to
prop
up
their
walls
and
defend
their
bulwarks
every
one
in
short
lending
a
hand
diogenes
observing
this
and
having
nothing
to
do
for
nobody
employed
him
tucked
up
his
robe
and
with
all
his
might
fell
a
rolling
his
tub
which
he
lived
in
up
and
down
the
cranium
what
are
you
about
said
one
of
his
friends
rolling
my
tub
replied
he
that
whilst
everybody
is
busy
around
me
i
may
not
be
the
only
idle
person
in
the
kingdom
in
like
manner
i
my
dear
philo
being
very
loath
in
this
noisy
age
to
make
no
noise
at
all
or
to
act
the
part
of
a
mute
in
the
comedy
think
it
highly
proper
that
i
should
roll
my
tub
also
not
that
i
mean
to
write
history
myself
or
be
a
narrator
of
facts
you
need
not
fear
me
i
am
not
so
rash
knowing
the
danger
too
well
if
i
roll
it
amongst
the
stones
especially
such
a
tub
as
mine
which
is
not
so
that
the
least
pebble
i
strike
against
would
dash
it
in
pieces
i
will
tell
you
however
what
my
design
is
how
i
mean
to
be
present
at
the
battle
and
yet
keep
out
of
the
reach
of
danger
i
intend
to
shelter
myself
from
the
waves
and
the
smoke
and
the
cares
that
writers
are
liable
to
and
only
give
them
a
little
good
advice
and
a
few
precepts
to
have
in
short
some
little
hand
in
the
building
though
i
do
not
expect
my
name
will
be
inscribed
on
it
as
i
shall
but
just
touch
the
mortar
with
the
tip
of
my
finger
there
are
many
i
know
who
think
there
is
no
necessity
for
instruction
at
all
with
regard
to
this
business
any
more
than
there
is
for
walking
seeing
or
eating
and
that
it
is
the
easiest
thing
in
the
world
for
a
man
to
write
history
if
he
can
but
say
what
comes
uppermost
but
you
my
friend
are
convinced
that
it
is
no
such
easy
matter
nor
should
it
be
negligently
and
carelessly
performed
but
that
on
the
other
hand
if
there
be
anything
in
the
whole
circle
of
literature
that
requires
more
than
ordinary
care
and
attention
it
is
undoubtedly
this
at
least
if
a
man
would
wish
as
thucydides
says
to
labour
for
posterity
i
very
well
know
that
i
can
not
attack
so
many
without
rendering
myself
obnoxious
to
some
especially
those
whose
histories
are
already
finished
and
made
public
even
if
what
i
say
should
be
approved
by
them
it
would
be
madness
to
expect
that
they
should
retract
anything
or
alter
that
which
had
been
once
established
and
as
it
were
laid
up
in
royal
repositories
it
may
not
be
amiss
however
to
give
them
these
instructions
that
in
case
of
another
war
the
getae
against
the
gauls
or
the
indians
perhaps
against
the
barbarians
for
with
regard
to
ourselves
there
is
no
danger
our
enemies
being
all
subdued
by
applying
these
rules
if
they
like
them
they
may
know
better
how
to
write
for
the
future
if
they
do
not
choose
this
they
may
even
go
on
by
their
old
measure
the
physician
will
not
break
his
heart
if
all
the
people
of
abdera
follow
their
own
inclination
and
continue
to
act
the
andromeda
criticism
is
twofold
that
which
teaches
us
what
we
are
to
choose
and
that
which
teaches
us
what
to
avoid
we
will
begin
with
the
last
and
consider
what
those
faults
are
which
a
writer
of
history
should
be
free
from
next
what
it
is
that
will
lead
him
into
the
right
path
how
he
should
begin
what
order
and
method
he
should
observe
what
he
should
pass
over
in
silence
and
what
he
should
dwell
upon
how
things
may
be
best
illustrated
and
connected
of
these
and
such
as
these
we
will
speak
hereafter
in
the
meantime
let
us
point
out
the
faults
which
bad
writers
are
most
generally
guilty
of
the
blunders
which
they
commit
in
language
composition
and
sentiment
with
many
other
marks
of
ignorance
which
it
would
be
tedious
to
enumerate
and
belong
not
to
our
present
argument
the
principal
faults
as
i
observed
to
you
are
in
the
language
and
composition
you
will
find
on
examination
that
history
in
general
has
a
great
many
of
this
kind
which
if
you
listen
to
them
all
you
will
be
sufficiently
convinced
of
and
for
this
purpose
it
may
not
be
unseasonable
to
recollect
some
of
them
by
way
of
example
and
the
first
that
i
shall
mention
is
that
intolerable
custom
which
most
of
them
have
of
omitting
facts
and
dwelling
for
ever
on
the
praises
of
their
generals
and
commanders
extolling
to
the
skies
their
own
leaders
and
degrading
beyond
measure
those
of
their
enemies
not
knowing
how
much
history
differs
from
panegyric
that
there
is
a
great
wall
between
them
or
that
to
use
a
musical
phrase
they
are
a
double
octave
distant
from
each
other
the
sole
business
of
the
panegyrist
is
at
all
events
and
by
every
means
to
extol
and
delight
the
object
of
his
praise
and
it
little
concerns
him
whether
it
be
true
or
not
but
history
will
not
admit
the
least
degree
of
falsehood
any
more
than
as
physicians
say
the
can
receive
into
it
any
kind
of
food
these
men
seem
not
to
know
that
poetry
has
its
particular
rules
and
precepts
and
that
history
is
governed
by
others
directly
opposite
that
with
regard
to
the
former
the
licence
is
immoderate
and
there
is
scarce
any
law
but
what
the
poet
prescribes
to
himself
when
he
is
full
of
the
deity
and
possessed
as
it
were
by
the
muses
if
he
has
a
mind
to
put
winged
horses
to
his
chariot
and
drive
some
through
the
waters
and
others
over
the
tops
of
unbending
corn
there
is
no
offence
taken
neither
if
his
jupiter
hangs
the
earth
and
sea
at
the
end
of
a
chain
are
we
afraid
that
it
should
break
and
destroy
us
all
if
he
wants
to
extol
agamemnon
who
shall
forbid
his
bestowing
on
him
the
head
and
eyes
of
jupiter
the
breast
of
his
brother
neptune
and
the
belt
of
mars
the
son
of
atreus
and
aerope
must
be
a
composition
of
all
the
gods
nor
are
jupiter
mars
and
neptune
sufficient
perhaps
of
themselves
to
give
us
an
idea
of
his
perfection
but
if
history
admits
any
adulation
of
this
kind
it
becomes
a
sort
of
prosaic
poetry
without
its
numbers
or
magnificence
a
heap
of
monstrous
stories
only
more
conspicuous
by
their
incredibility
he
is
unpardonable
therefore
who
can
not
distinguish
one
from
the
other
but
lays
on
history
the
paint
of
poetry
its
flattery
fable
and
hyperbole
it
is
just
as
ridiculous
as
it
would
be
to
clothe
one
of
our
robust
wrestlers
who
is
as
hard
as
an
oak
in
fine
purple
or
some
such
meretricious
garb
and
put
paint
on
his
cheeks
how
would
such
ornaments
debase
and
degrade
him
i
do
not
mean
by
this
that
in
history
we
are
not
to
praise
sometimes
but
it
must
be
done
at
proper
seasons
and
in
a
proper
degree
that
it
may
not
offend
the
readers
of
future
ages
for
future
ages
must
be
considered
in
this
affair
as
i
shall
endeavour
to
prove
hereafter
those
i
must
here
observe
are
greatly
mistaken
who
divide
history
into
two
parts
the
useful
and
the
agreeable
and
in
consequence
of
it
would
introduce
panegyric
as
always
delectable
and
entertaining
to
the
reader
but
the
division
itself
is
false
and
delusive
for
the
great
end
and
design
of
history
is
to
be
useful
a
species
of
merit
which
can
only
arise
from
its
truth
if
the
agreeable
follows
so
much
the
better
as
there
may
be
beauty
in
a
wrestler
and
yet
hercules
would
esteem
the
brave
though
ugly
nicostratus
as
much
as
the
beautiful
alcaeus
and
thus
history
when
she
adds
pleasure
to
utility
may
attract
more
admirers
though
as
long
as
she
is
possessed
of
that
greatest
of
perfections
truth
she
need
not
be
anxious
concerning
beauty
in
history
nothing
fabulous
can
be
agreeable
and
flattery
is
disgusting
to
all
readers
except
the
very
dregs
of
the
people
good
judges
look
with
the
eyes
of
argus
on
every
part
reject
everything
that
is
false
and
adulterated
and
will
admit
nothing
but
what
is
true
clear
and
well
expressed
these
are
the
men
you
are
to
have
a
regard
to
when
you
write
rather
than
the
vulgar
though
your
flattery
should
delight
them
ever
so
much
if
you
stuff
history
with
fulsome
encomiums
and
idle
tales
you
will
make
her
like
hercules
in
lydia
as
you
may
have
seen
him
painted
waiting
upon
omphale
who
is
dressed
in
the
lion
skin
with
his
club
in
her
hand
whilst
he
is
represented
clothed
in
yellow
and
purple
and
spinning
and
omphale
beating
him
with
her
slipper
a
ridiculous
spectacle
wherein
everything
manly
and
godlike
is
sunk
and
degraded
to
effeminacy
the
multitude
perhaps
indeed
may
admire
such
things
but
the
judicious
few
whose
opinion
you
despise
will
always
laugh
at
what
is
absurd
incongruous
and
inconsistent
everything
has
a
beauty
peculiar
to
itself
but
if
you
put
one
instead
of
another
the
most
beautiful
becomes
ugly
because
it
is
not
in
its
proper
place
i
need
not
add
that
praise
is
agreeable
only
to
the
person
praised
and
disgustful
to
everybody
else
especially
when
it
is
lavishly
bestowed
as
is
the
practice
of
most
writers
who
are
so
extremely
desirous
of
recommending
themselves
by
flattery
and
dwell
so
much
upon
it
as
to
convince
the
reader
it
is
mere
adulation
which
they
have
not
art
enough
to
conceal
but
heap
up
together
naked
uncovered
and
totally
incredible
so
that
they
seldom
gain
what
they
expected
from
it
for
the
person
flattered
if
he
has
anything
noble
or
manly
in
him
only
abhors
and
despises
them
for
it
as
mean
parasites
aristobulus
after
he
had
written
an
account
of
the
single
combat
between
alexander
and
porus
showed
that
monarch
a
particular
part
of
it
wherein
the
better
to
get
into
his
good
graces
he
had
inserted
a
great
deal
more
than
was
true
when
alexander
seized
the
book
and
threw
it
for
they
happened
at
that
time
to
be
sailing
on
the
hydaspes
directly
into
the
river
thus
said
he
ought
you
to
have
been
served
yourself
for
pretending
to
describe
my
battles
and
killing
half
a
dozen
elephants
for
me
with
a
single
spear
this
anger
was
worthy
of
alexander
of
him
who
could
not
bear
the
adulation
of
that
architect
who
promised
to
transform
mount
athos
into
a
statue
of
him
but
he
looked
upon
the
man
from
that
time
as
a
base
flatterer
and
never
employed
him
afterwards
what
is
there
in
this
custom
therefore
that
can
be
agreeable
unless
to
the
proud
and
vain
to
deformed
men
or
ugly
women
who
insist
on
being
painted
handsome
and
think
they
shall
look
better
if
the
artist
gives
them
a
little
more
red
and
white
such
for
the
most
part
are
the
historians
of
our
times
who
sacrifice
everything
to
the
present
moment
and
their
own
interest
and
advantage
who
can
only
be
despised
as
ignorant
flatterers
of
the
age
they
live
in
and
as
men
who
at
the
same
time
by
their
extravagant
stories
make
everything
which
they
relate
liable
to
suspicion
if
notwithstanding
any
are
still
of
opinion
that
the
agreeable
should
be
admitted
in
history
let
them
join
that
which
is
pleasant
with
that
which
is
true
by
the
beauties
of
style
and
diction
instead
of
foisting
in
as
is
commonly
done
what
is
nothing
to
the
purpose
i
will
now
acquaint
you
with
some
things
i
lately
picked
up
in
ionia
and
achaia
from
several
historians
who
gave
accounts
of
this
war
by
the
graces
i
beseech
you
to
give
me
credit
for
what
i
am
going
to
tell
you
as
i
could
swear
to
the
truth
of
it
if
it
were
polite
to
swear
in
a
dissertation
one
of
these
gentlemen
begins
by
invoking
the
muses
and
entreats
the
goddesses
to
assist
him
in
the
performance
what
an
excellent
setting
out
and
how
properly
is
this
form
of
speech
adapted
to
history
a
little
farther
on
he
compares
our
emperor
to
achilles
and
the
persian
king
to
thersites
not
considering
that
his
achilles
would
have
been
a
much
greater
man
if
he
had
killed
hector
rather
than
thersites
if
the
brave
should
fly
he
who
pursues
must
be
braver
then
follows
an
encomium
on
himself
showing
how
worthy
he
is
to
recite
such
noble
actions
and
when
he
is
got
on
a
little
he
extols
his
own
country
miletus
adding
that
in
this
he
had
acted
better
than
homer
who
never
tells
us
where
he
was
born
he
informs
us
moreover
at
the
end
of
his
preface
in
the
most
plain
and
positive
terms
that
he
shall
take
care
to
make
the
best
he
can
of
our
own
affairs
and
as
far
as
lies
in
his
power
to
get
the
upper
hand
of
our
enemies
the
barbarians
after
investigating
the
cause
of
the
war
he
begins
thus
that
vilest
of
all
wretches
vologesus
entered
upon
the
war
for
these
reasons
such
is
this
historian
manner
another
a
close
imitator
of
thucydides
that
he
may
set
out
as
his
master
does
gives
us
an
exordium
that
smells
of
the
true
attic
honey
and
begins
thus
creperius
calpurnianus
a
citizen
of
pompeia
hath
written
the
history
of
the
war
between
the
parthians
and
the
romans
showing
how
they
fought
with
one
another
commencing
at
the
time
when
it
first
broke
out
after
this
need
i
inform
you
how
he
harangued
in
armenia
by
another
corcyraean
orator
or
how
to
be
revenged
of
the
nisibaeans
for
not
taking
part
with
the
romans
he
sent
the
plague
amongst
them
taking
the
whole
from
thucydides
excepting
the
long
walls
of
athens
he
had
begun
from
aethiopia
descended
into
egypt
and
passed
over
great
part
of
the
royal
territory
well
it
was
that
he
stopped
there
when
i
left
him
he
was
burying
the
miserable
athenians
at
nisibis
but
as
i
knew
what
he
was
going
to
tell
us
i
took
my
leave
of
him
another
thing
very
common
with
these
historians
is
by
way
of
imitating
thucydides
to
make
use
of
his
phrases
perhaps
with
a
little
alteration
to
adopt
his
manner
in
little
modes
and
expressions
such
as
you
must
yourself
acknowledge
for
the
same
reason
a
little
more
and
i
had
forgot
and
the
like
this
same
writer
when
he
has
occasion
to
mention
bridges
fosses
or
any
of
the
machines
used
in
war
gives
them
roman
names
but
how
does
it
suit
the
dignity
of
history
or
resemble
thucydides
to
mix
the
attic
and
italian
thus
as
if
it
was
ornamental
and
becoming
another
of
them
gives
us
a
plain
simple
journal
of
everything
that
was
done
such
as
a
common
soldier
might
have
written
or
a
sutler
who
followed
the
camp
this
however
was
tolerable
because
it
pretended
to
nothing
more
and
might
be
useful
by
supplying
materials
for
some
better
historian
i
only
blame
him
for
his
pompous
introduction
callimorphus
physician
to
the
sixth
legion
of
spearmen
his
history
of
the
parthian
war
then
his
books
are
all
carefully
numbered
and
he
entertains
us
with
a
most
frigid
preface
which
he
concludes
with
saying
that
a
physician
must
be
the
fittest
of
all
men
to
write
history
because
aesculapius
was
the
son
of
apollo
and
apollo
is
the
leader
of
the
muses
and
the
great
prince
of
literature
besides
this
after
setting
out
in
delicate
ionic
he
drops
i
know
not
how
into
the
most
vulgar
style
and
expressions
used
only
by
the
very
dregs
of
the
people
and
here
i
must
not
pass
over
a
certain
wise
man
whose
name
however
i
shall
not
mention
his
work
is
lately
published
at
corinth
and
is
beyond
everything
one
could
have
conceived
in
the
very
first
sentence
of
his
preface
he
takes
his
readers
to
task
and
convinces
them
by
the
most
sagacious
method
of
reasoning
that
none
but
a
wise
man
should
ever
attempt
to
write
history
then
comes
syllogism
upon
syllogism
every
kind
of
argument
is
by
turns
made
use
of
to
introduce
the
meanest
and
most
fulsome
adulation
and
even
this
is
brought
in
by
syllogism
and
interrogation
what
appeared
to
me
the
most
intolerable
and
unbecoming
the
long
beard
of
a
philosopher
was
his
saying
in
the
preface
that
our
emperor
was
above
all
men
most
happy
whose
actions
even
philosophers
did
not
disdain
to
celebrate
surely
this
if
it
ought
to
be
said
at
all
should
have
been
left
for
us
to
say
rather
than
himself
neither
must
we
here
forget
that
historian
who
begins
thus
i
come
to
speak
of
the
romans
and
persians
and
a
little
after
he
says
for
the
persians
ought
to
suffer
and
in
another
place
there
was
one
osroes
whom
the
greeks
call
oxyrrhoes
with
many
things
of
this
kind
this
man
is
just
such
a
one
as
him
i
mentioned
before
only
that
one
is
like
thucydides
and
the
other
the
exact
resemblance
of
herodotus
but
there
is
yet
another
writer
renowned
for
eloquence
another
thucydides
or
rather
superior
to
him
who
most
elaborately
describes
every
city
mountain
field
and
river
and
cries
out
with
all
his
might
may
the
great
averter
of
evil
turn
it
all
on
our
enemies
this
is
colder
than
caspian
snow
or
celtic
ice
the
emperor
shield
takes
up
a
whole
book
to
describe
the
eyes
are
blue
and
black
and
white
the
serpents
twine
about
his
hair
and
his
belt
has
all
the
colours
of
the
rainbow
how
many
thousand
lines
does
it
cost
him
to
describe
vologesus
breeches
and
his
horse
bridle
and
how
osroes
hair
looked
when
he
swam
over
the
tigris
what
sort
of
a
cave
he
fled
into
and
how
it
was
shaded
all
over
with
ivy
and
myrtle
and
laurel
twined
together
you
plainly
see
how
necessary
this
was
to
the
history
and
that
we
could
not
possibly
have
understood
what
was
going
forward
without
it
from
inability
and
ignorance
of
everything
useful
these
men
are
driven
to
descriptions
of
countries
and
caverns
and
when
they
come
into
a
multiplicity
of
great
and
momentous
affairs
are
utterly
at
a
loss
like
a
servant
enriched
on
a
sudden
by
coming
into
his
master
estate
who
does
not
know
how
to
put
on
his
clothes
or
to
eat
as
he
should
do
but
when
fine
birds
fat
sows
and
hares
are
placed
before
him
falls
to
and
eats
till
he
bursts
of
salt
meat
and
pottage
the
writer
i
just
now
mentioned
describes
the
strangest
wounds
and
the
most
extraordinary
deaths
you
ever
heard
of
tells
us
of
a
man
being
wounded
in
the
great
toe
and
expiring
immediately
and
how
on
priscus
the
general
bawling
out
loud
of
the
enemy
fell
down
dead
upon
the
spot
he
has
told
lies
moreover
about
the
number
of
the
slain
in
contradiction
to
the
account
given
in
by
the
leaders
he
will
have
it
that
seventy
thousand
two
hundred
and
of
the
enemy
died
at
europus
and
of
the
romans
only
two
and
nine
wounded
surely
nobody
in
their
senses
can
bear
this
another
thing
should
be
mentioned
here
also
which
is
no
little
fault
from
the
affectation
of
atticism
and
a
more
than
ordinary
attention
to
purity
of
diction
he
has
taken
the
liberty
to
turn
the
roman
names
into
greek
to
call
saturninus
greek
chronius
fronto
greek
frontis
titianus
greek
titanius
and
others
still
more
ridiculous
with
regard
to
the
death
of
severian
he
informs
us
that
everybody
else
was
mistaken
when
they
imagined
that
he
perished
by
the
sword
for
that
the
man
starved
himself
to
death
as
he
thought
that
the
easiest
way
of
dying
not
knowing
which
was
the
case
that
he
could
only
have
fasted
three
days
whereas
many
have
lived
without
food
for
seven
unless
we
are
to
suppose
that
osroes
stood
waiting
till
severian
had
starved
himself
completely
and
for
that
reason
he
would
not
live
out
the
whole
week
but
in
what
class
my
dear
philo
shall
we
rank
those
historians
who
are
perpetually
making
use
of
poetical
expressions
such
as
the
engine
crushed
the
wall
thundered
and
in
another
place
edessa
resounded
with
the
shock
of
arms
and
all
was
noise
and
tumult
around
and
again
often
the
leader
in
his
mind
revolved
how
best
he
might
approach
the
wall
at
the
same
time
amongst
these
were
interspersed
some
of
the
meanest
and
most
beggarly
phrases
such
as
the
leader
of
the
army
epistolised
his
master
the
soldiers
bought
utensils
they
washed
and
waited
on
them
with
many
other
things
of
the
same
kind
like
a
tragedian
with
a
high
cothurnus
on
one
foot
and
a
slipper
on
the
other
you
will
meet
with
many
of
these
writers
who
will
give
you
a
fine
heroic
long
preface
that
makes
you
hope
for
something
extraordinary
to
follow
when
after
all
the
body
of
the
history
shall
be
idle
weak
and
trifling
such
as
puts
you
in
mind
of
a
sporting
cupid
who
covers
his
head
with
the
mask
of
a
hercules
or
titan
the
reader
immediately
cries
out
the
mountain
has
brought
forth
certainly
it
ought
not
to
be
so
everything
should
be
alike
and
of
the
same
colour
the
body
fitted
to
the
head
not
a
golden
helmet
with
a
ridiculous
plate
made
of
stinking
skins
shreds
and
patches
a
basket
shield
and
boots
and
yet
numbers
of
them
put
the
head
of
a
rhodian
colossus
on
the
body
of
a
dwarf
whilst
others
show
you
a
body
without
a
head
and
step
directly
into
the
midst
of
things
bringing
in
xenophon
for
their
authority
who
begins
with
darius
and
parysatis
had
two
sons
so
likewise
have
other
ancient
writers
not
considering
that
the
narration
itself
may
sometimes
supply
the
place
of
preface
or
exordium
though
it
does
not
appear
to
the
vulgar
eye
as
we
shall
show
hereafter
all
this
however
with
regard
to
style
and
composition
may
be
borne
with
but
when
they
misinform
us
about
places
and
make
mistakes
not
of
a
few
leagues
but
whole
day
journeys
what
shall
we
say
to
such
historians
one
of
them
who
never
we
may
suppose
so
much
as
conversed
with
a
syrian
or
picked
up
anything
concerning
them
in
the
barbers
shop
when
he
speaks
of
europus
tells
us
it
is
situated
in
mesopotamia
two
days
journey
from
euphrates
and
was
built
by
the
edessenes
not
content
with
this
the
same
noble
writer
has
taken
away
my
poor
country
samosata
and
carried
it
off
tower
bulwarks
and
all
to
mesopotamia
where
he
says
it
is
shut
up
between
two
rivers
which
at
least
run
close
to
if
they
do
not
wash
the
walls
of
it
after
this
it
would
be
to
no
purpose
my
dear
philo
for
me
to
assure
you
that
i
am
not
from
parthia
nor
do
i
belong
to
mesopotamia
of
which
this
admirable
historian
has
thought
fit
to
make
me
an
inhabitant
what
he
tells
us
of
severian
and
which
he
swears
he
heard
from
those
who
were
of
it
is
no
doubt
extremely
probable
that
he
did
not
choose
to
drink
poison
or
to
hang
himself
but
was
resolved
to
find
out
some
new
and
tragical
way
of
dying
that
accordingly
having
some
large
cups
of
very
fine
glass
as
soon
as
he
had
taken
the
resolution
to
finish
himself
he
broke
one
of
them
in
pieces
and
with
a
fragment
of
it
cut
his
throat
he
would
not
make
use
of
sword
or
spear
that
his
death
might
be
more
noble
and
heroic
to
complete
all
because
thucydides
made
a
funeral
oration
on
the
heroes
who
fell
at
the
beginning
of
the
peloponnesian
war
he
also
thought
something
should
be
said
of
severian
these
historians
you
must
know
will
always
have
a
little
struggle
with
thucydides
though
he
had
nothing
to
do
with
the
war
in
armenia
our
writer
therefore
after
burying
severian
most
magnificently
places
at
his
sepulchre
one
afranius
silo
a
centurion
the
rival
of
pericles
who
spoke
so
fine
a
declamation
upon
him
as
by
heaven
made
me
laugh
till
i
cried
again
particularly
when
the
orator
seemed
deeply
afflicted
and
with
tears
in
his
eyes
lamented
the
sumptuous
entertainments
and
drinking
bouts
which
he
should
no
more
partake
of
to
crown
all
with
an
imitation
of
ajax
the
orator
draws
his
sword
and
as
it
became
the
noble
afranius
before
all
the
assembly
kills
himself
at
the
tomb
so
mars
defend
me
but
he
deserved
to
die
much
sooner
for
making
such
a
declamation
when
those
says
he
who
were
present
beheld
this
they
were
filled
with
admiration
and
beyond
measure
extolled
afranius
for
my
own
part
i
pitied
him
for
the
loss
of
the
cakes
and
dishes
which
he
so
lamented
and
only
blamed
him
for
not
destroying
the
writer
of
the
history
before
he
made
an
end
of
himself
others
there
are
who
from
ignorance
and
want
of
skill
not
knowing
what
should
be
mentioned
and
what
passed
over
in
silence
entirely
omit
or
slightly
run
through
things
of
the
greatest
consequence
and
most
worthy
of
attention
whilst
they
most
copiously
describe
and
dwell
upon
trifles
which
is
just
as
absurd
as
it
would
be
not
to
take
notice
of
or
admire
the
wonderful
beauty
of
the
olympian
jupiter
and
at
the
same
time
to
be
lavish
in
our
praises
of
the
fine
polish
workmanship
and
proportion
of
the
base
and
pedestal
i
remember
one
of
these
who
despatches
the
battle
at
europus
in
seven
lines
and
spends
some
hundreds
in
a
long
frigid
narration
that
is
nothing
to
the
purpose
showing
how
a
certain
moorish
cavalier
wandering
on
the
mountains
in
search
of
water
lit
on
some
syrian
rustics
who
helped
him
to
a
dinner
how
they
were
afraid
of
him
at
first
but
afterwards
became
intimately
acquainted
with
him
and
received
him
with
hospitality
for
one
of
them
it
seems
had
been
in
mauritania
where
his
brother
bore
arms
then
follows
a
long
tale
how
he
hunted
in
mauritania
and
saw
several
elephants
feeding
together
how
he
had
like
to
have
been
devoured
by
a
lion
and
how
many
fish
he
bought
at
caesarea
this
admirable
historian
takes
no
notice
of
the
battle
the
attacks
or
defences
the
truces
the
guards
on
each
side
or
anything
else
but
stands
from
morning
to
night
looking
upon
malchion
the
syrian
who
buys
cheap
fish
at
caesarea
if
night
had
not
come
on
i
suppose
he
would
have
supped
there
as
the
chars
were
ready
if
these
things
had
not
been
carefully
recorded
in
the
history
we
should
have
been
sadly
in
the
dark
and
the
romans
would
have
had
an
insufferable
loss
if
mausacas
the
thirsty
moor
could
have
found
nothing
to
drink
or
returned
to
the
camp
without
his
supper
not
to
mention
here
what
is
still
more
ridiculous
as
how
a
piper
came
up
to
them
out
of
the
neighbouring
village
and
how
they
made
presents
to
each
other
mausacas
giving
malchion
a
spear
and
malchion
presenting
mausacas
with
a
buckle
such
are
the
principal
occurrences
in
the
history
of
the
battle
of
europus
one
may
truly
say
of
such
writers
that
they
never
saw
the
roses
on
the
tree
but
took
care
to
gather
the
prickles
that
grew
at
the
bottom
of
it
another
of
them
who
had
never
set
a
foot
out
of
corinth
or
seen
syria
or
armenia
begins
thus
it
is
better
to
trust
our
eyes
than
our
ears
i
write
therefore
what
i
have
seen
and
not
what
i
have
heard
he
saw
everything
so
extremely
well
that
he
tells
us
the
parthian
dragons
which
amongst
them
signifies
no
more
than
a
great
number
for
one
dragon
brings
a
thousand
are
live
serpents
of
a
prodigious
size
that
breed
in
persia
a
little
above
iberia
that
these
are
lifted
up
on
long
poles
and
spread
terror
to
a
great
distance
and
that
when
the
battle
begins
they
let
them
loose
on
the
enemy
many
of
our
soldiers
he
tells
us
were
devoured
by
them
and
a
vast
number
pressed
to
death
by
being
locked
in
their
embraces
this
he
beheld
himself
from
the
top
of
a
high
tree
to
which
he
had
retired
for
safety
well
it
was
for
us
that
he
so
prudently
determined
not
to
come
nigh
them
we
might
otherwise
have
lost
this
excellent
writer
who
with
his
own
brave
hand
performed
such
feats
in
this
battle
for
he
went
through
many
dangers
and
was
wounded
somewhere
about
susa
i
suppose
in
his
journey
from
cranium
to
lerna
all
this
he
recited
to
the
corinthians
who
very
well
knew
that
he
had
never
so
much
as
seen
a
view
of
this
battle
painted
on
a
wall
neither
did
he
know
anything
of
arms
or
military
machines
the
method
of
disposing
troops
or
even
the
proper
names
of
them
another
famous
writer
has
given
an
account
of
everything
that
passed
from
beginning
to
end
in
armenia
syria
mesopotamia
upon
the
tigris
and
in
media
and
all
in
less
than
five
hundred
lines
and
when
he
had
done
this
tells
us
he
has
written
a
history
the
title
which
is
almost
as
long
as
the
work
runs
thus
a
narrative
of
everything
done
by
the
romans
in
armenia
media
and
mesopotamia
by
antiochianus
who
gained
a
prize
in
the
sacred
games
of
apollo
i
suppose
when
he
was
a
boy
he
had
conquered
in
a
running
match
i
have
heard
of
another
likewise
who
wrote
a
history
of
what
was
to
happen
hereafter
and
describes
the
taking
of
vologesus
prisoner
the
murder
of
osroes
and
how
he
was
to
be
given
to
a
lion
and
above
all
our
own
triumph
as
things
that
must
come
to
pass
thus
prophesying
away
he
soon
got
to
the
end
of
the
story
he
has
built
moreover
a
new
city
in
mesopotamia
most
magnificently
magnificent
and
most
beautifully
beautiful
and
is
considering
with
himself
whether
he
shall
call
it
victoria
from
victory
or
the
city
of
concord
or
peace
which
of
them
however
is
not
yet
determined
and
this
fine
city
must
remain
without
a
name
filled
as
it
is
with
nothing
but
this
writer
folly
and
nonsense
he
is
now
going
about
a
long
voyage
and
to
give
us
a
description
of
what
is
to
be
done
in
india
and
this
is
more
than
a
promise
for
the
preface
is
already
made
and
the
third
legion
the
gauls
and
a
small
part
of
the
mauritanian
forces
under
cassius
have
already
passed
the
river
what
they
will
do
afterwards
or
how
they
will
succeed
against
the
elephants
it
will
be
some
time
before
our
wonderful
writer
can
be
able
to
learn
either
from
mazuris
or
the
oxydraci
thus
do
these
foolish
fellows
trifle
with
us
neither
knowing
what
is
fit
to
be
done
nor
if
they
did
able
to
execute
it
at
the
same
time
determined
to
say
anything
that
comes
into
their
ridiculous
heads
affecting
to
be
grand
and
pompous
even
in
their
titles
of
the
parthian
victories
so
many
books
parthias
says
another
like
atthis
another
more
elegantly
calls
his
book
the
parthonicica
of
demetrius
i
could
mention
many
more
of
equal
merit
with
these
but
shall
now
proceed
to
make
my
promise
good
and
give
some
instructions
how
to
write
better
i
have
not
produced
these
examples
merely
to
laugh
at
and
ridicule
these
noble
histories
but
with
the
view
of
real
advantages
that
he
who
avoids
their
errors
may
himself
learn
to
write
well
if
it
be
true
as
the
logicians
assert
that
of
two
opposites
between
which
there
is
no
medium
the
one
being
taken
away
the
other
must
remain
somebody
perhaps
will
tell
me
that
the
field
is
now
cleansed
and
weeded
that
the
briars
and
brambles
are
cut
up
the
rubbish
cleared
off
and
the
rough
path
made
smooth
that
i
ought
therefore
to
build
something
myself
to
show
that
i
not
only
can
pull
down
the
structures
of
others
but
am
able
to
raise
up
and
invent
a
work
truly
great
and
excellent
which
nobody
could
find
fault
with
nor
momus
himself
turn
into
ridicule
i
say
therefore
that
he
who
would
write
history
well
must
be
possessed
of
these
two
principal
qualifications
a
fine
understanding
and
a
good
style
one
is
the
gift
of
nature
and
can
not
be
taught
the
other
may
be
acquired
by
frequent
exercise
perpetual
labour
and
an
emulation
of
the
ancients
to
make
men
sensible
and
sagacious
who
were
not
born
so
is
more
than
i
pretend
to
to
create
and
things
in
this
manner
would
be
a
glorious
thing
indeed
but
one
might
as
easily
make
gold
out
of
lead
silver
out
of
tin
a
titornus
out
of
a
conon
or
a
milo
out
of
a
leotrophides
what
then
is
in
the
power
of
art
or
instruction
to
perform
not
to
create
qualities
and
perfections
already
bestowed
but
to
teach
the
proper
use
of
them
for
as
iccus
herodicus
theon
or
any
other
famous
wrestler
would
not
promise
to
make
antiochus
a
conqueror
in
the
olympic
games
or
equal
to
a
theagenes
or
polydamas
but
only
that
where
a
man
had
natural
abilities
for
this
exercise
he
could
by
his
instruction
render
him
a
greater
proficient
in
it
far
be
it
from
me
also
to
promise
the
invention
of
an
art
so
difficult
as
this
nor
do
i
say
that
i
can
make
anybody
an
historian
but
that
i
will
point
out
to
one
of
good
understanding
and
who
has
been
in
some
measure
used
to
writing
certain
proper
paths
if
such
they
appear
to
him
which
if
any
man
shall
tread
in
he
may
with
greater
ease
and
despatch
do
what
he
ought
to
do
and
attain
the
end
which
he
is
in
pursuit
of
neither
can
it
be
here
asserted
be
he
ever
so
sensible
or
sagacious
that
he
doth
not
stand
in
need
of
assistance
with
regard
to
those
things
which
he
is
ignorant
of
otherwise
he
might
play
on
the
flute
or
any
other
instrument
who
had
never
learned
and
perform
just
as
well
but
without
teaching
the
hands
will
do
nothing
whereas
if
there
be
a
master
we
quickly
learn
and
are
soon
able
to
play
by
ourselves
give
me
a
scholar
therefore
who
is
able
to
think
and
to
write
to
look
with
an
eye
of
discernment
into
things
and
to
do
business
himself
if
called
upon
who
hath
both
civil
and
military
knowledge
one
moreover
who
has
been
in
camps
and
has
seen
armies
in
the
field
and
out
of
it
knows
the
use
of
arms
and
machines
and
warlike
engines
of
every
kind
can
tell
what
the
front
and
what
the
horn
is
how
the
ranks
are
to
be
disposed
how
the
horse
is
to
be
directed
and
from
whence
to
advance
or
to
retreat
one
in
short
who
does
not
stay
at
home
and
trust
to
the
reports
of
others
but
above
all
let
him
be
of
a
noble
and
liberal
mind
let
him
neither
fear
nor
hope
for
anything
otherwise
he
will
only
resemble
those
unjust
judges
who
determine
from
partiality
or
prejudice
and
give
sentence
for
hire
but
whatever
the
man
is
as
such
let
him
be
described
the
historian
must
not
care
for
philip
when
he
loses
his
eye
by
the
arrow
of
aster
at
olynthus
nor
for
alexander
when
he
so
cruelly
killed
clytus
at
the
banquet
cleon
must
not
terrify
him
powerful
as
he
was
in
the
senate
and
supreme
at
the
tribunal
nor
prevent
his
recording
him
as
a
furious
and
pernicious
man
the
whole
city
of
athens
must
not
stop
his
relation
of
the
sicilian
slaughter
the
seizure
of
demosthenes
the
death
of
nicias
their
violent
thirst
the
water
which
they
drank
and
the
death
of
so
many
of
them
whilst
they
were
drinking
it
he
will
imagine
which
will
certainly
be
the
case
that
no
man
in
his
senses
will
blame
him
for
recording
things
exactly
as
they
fell
out
however
some
may
have
miscarried
by
imprudence
or
others
by
ill
fortune
he
is
only
the
relator
not
the
author
of
them
if
they
are
beaten
in
a
it
is
not
he
who
sinks
them
if
they
fly
it
is
not
he
who
pursues
them
all
he
can
do
is
to
wish
well
to
and
offer
up
his
vows
for
them
but
by
passing
over
or
contradicting
facts
he
can
not
alter
or
amend
them
it
would
have
been
very
easy
indeed
for
thucydides
with
a
stroke
of
his
pen
to
have
thrown
down
the
walls
of
epipolis
sunk
the
vessel
of
hermocrates
or
made
an
end
of
the
execrable
gylippus
who
stopped
up
all
the
avenues
with
his
walls
and
ditches
to
have
thrown
the
syracusans
on
the
lautumiae
and
have
let
the
athenians
go
round
sicily
and
italy
according
to
the
early
hopes
of
alcibiades
but
what
is
past
and
done
clotho
can
not
weave
again
nor
atropos
recall
the
only
business
of
the
historian
is
to
relate
things
exactly
as
they
are
this
he
can
never
do
as
long
as
he
is
afraid
of
artaxerxes
whose
physician
he
is
as
long
as
he
looks
for
the
purple
robe
the
golden
chain
or
the
nisaean
horse
as
the
reward
of
his
labours
but
xenophon
that
just
writer
will
not
do
this
nor
thucydides
the
good
historian
though
he
may
have
private
enmity
against
any
man
will
esteem
the
public
welfare
of
more
consequence
to
him
and
will
prefer
truth
to
resentment
and
on
the
other
hand
be
he
ever
so
fond
of
any
man
will
not
spare
him
when
he
is
in
the
wrong
for
this
as
i
before
observed
is
the
most
essential
thing
in
history
to
sacrifice
to
truth
alone
and
cast
away
all
care
for
everything
else
the
great
universal
rule
and
standard
is
to
have
regard
not
to
those
who
read
now
but
to
those
who
are
to
peruse
our
works
hereafter
to
speak
impartially
the
historians
of
former
times
were
too
often
guilty
of
flattery
and
their
works
were
little
better
than
games
and
sports
the
effects
of
art
of
alexander
this
memorable
saying
is
recorded
i
should
be
glad
said
he
onesicritus
after
my
death
to
come
to
life
again
for
a
little
time
only
to
hear
what
the
people
then
living
will
say
of
me
for
i
am
not
surprised
that
they
praise
and
caress
me
now
as
every
one
hopes
by
baiting
well
to
catch
my
favour
though
homer
wrote
a
great
many
fabulous
things
concerning
achilles
the
world
was
induced
to
believe
him
for
this
only
reason
because
they
were
written
long
after
his
death
and
no
cause
could
be
assigned
why
he
should
tell
lies
about
him
the
good
historian
then
must
be
thus
described
he
must
be
fearless
uncorrupted
free
the
friend
of
truth
and
of
liberty
one
who
to
use
the
words
of
the
comic
poet
calls
a
fig
a
fig
and
a
skiff
a
skiff
neither
giving
nor
withholding
from
any
from
favour
or
from
enmity
not
influenced
by
pity
by
shame
or
by
remorse
a
just
judge
so
far
benevolent
to
all
as
never
to
give
more
than
is
due
to
any
in
his
work
a
stranger
to
all
of
no
country
bound
only
by
his
own
laws
acknowledging
no
sovereign
never
considering
what
this
or
that
man
may
say
of
him
but
relating
faithfully
everything
as
it
happened
this
rule
therefore
thucydides
observed
distinguishing
properly
the
faults
and
perfections
of
history
not
unmindful
of
the
great
reputation
which
herodotus
had
acquired
insomuch
that
his
books
were
called
by
the
names
of
the
muses
thucydides
tells
us
that
he
wrote
for
posterity
and
not
for
present
delight
that
he
by
no
means
approved
of
the
fabulous
but
was
desirous
of
delivering
down
the
truth
alone
to
future
ages
it
is
the
useful
he
adds
which
must
constitute
the
merit
of
history
that
by
the
retrospection
of
what
is
past
when
similar
events
occur
men
may
know
how
to
act
in
present
exigencies
such
an
historian
would
i
wish
to
have
under
my
care
with
regard
to
language
and
expression
i
would
not
have
it
rough
and
vehement
consisting
of
long
periods
or
complex
arguments
but
soft
quiet
smooth
and
peaceable
the
reflections
short
and
frequent
the
style
clear
and
perspicuous
for
as
freedom
and
truth
should
be
the
principal
perfections
of
the
writer
mind
so
with
regard
to
language
the
great
point
is
to
make
everything
plain
and
intelligible
not
to
use
remote
and
phrases
or
expressions
at
the
same
time
avoiding
such
as
are
mean
and
vulgar
let
it
be
in
short
what
the
lowest
may
understand
and
at
the
same
time
the
most
learned
can
not
but
approve
the
whole
may
be
adorned
with
figure
and
metaphor
provided
they
are
not
turgid
or
bombast
nor
seem
stiff
and
laboured
which
like
meat
too
highly
seasoned
always
give
disgust
history
may
sometimes
assume
a
poetical
form
and
rise
into
a
magnificence
of
expression
when
the
subject
demands
it
and
especially
when
it
is
describing
armies
battles
and
the
pierian
spirit
is
wanting
then
to
swell
the
sails
with
a
propitious
breeze
and
carry
the
lofty
ship
over
the
tops
of
the
waves
in
general
the
diction
should
creep
humbly
on
the
ground
and
only
be
raised
as
the
grand
and
beautiful
occurring
shall
require
it
keeping
in
the
meantime
within
proper
bounds
and
never
soaring
into
enthusiasm
for
then
it
is
in
danger
of
ranging
beyond
its
limits
into
poetic
fury
we
must
then
pull
in
the
rein
and
act
with
caution
well
knowing
that
it
is
the
worst
vice
of
a
writer
as
well
as
of
a
horse
to
be
wanton
and
unmanageable
the
best
way
therefore
is
whilst
the
mind
of
the
historian
is
on
horseback
for
his
style
to
walk
on
foot
and
take
hold
of
the
rein
that
it
may
not
be
left
behind
with
regard
to
composition
the
words
should
not
be
so
blended
and
transposed
as
to
appear
harsh
and
uncouth
nor
should
you
as
some
do
subject
them
entirely
to
the
rhythmus
one
is
always
faulty
and
the
other
disagreeable
to
the
reader
facts
must
not
be
carelessly
put
together
but
with
great
labour
and
attention
if
possible
let
the
historian
be
an
of
everything
he
means
to
record
or
if
that
can
not
be
rely
on
those
only
who
are
incorrupt
and
who
have
no
bias
from
passion
or
prejudice
to
add
or
to
diminish
anything
and
here
much
sagacity
will
be
requisite
to
find
out
the
real
truth
when
he
has
collected
all
or
most
of
his
materials
he
will
first
make
a
kind
of
diary
a
body
whose
members
are
not
yet
distinct
he
will
then
bring
it
into
order
and
beautify
it
add
the
colouring
of
style
and
language
adopt
his
expression
to
the
subject
and
harmonise
the
several
parts
of
it
then
like
homer
jupiter
who
casts
his
eye
sometimes
on
the
thracian
and
sometimes
on
the
mysian
forces
he
beholds
now
the
roman
and
now
the
persian
armies
now
both
if
they
are
engaged
and
relates
what
passes
in
them
whilst
they
are
embattled
his
eye
is
not
fixed
on
any
particular
part
nor
on
any
one
leader
unless
perhaps
a
brasidas
steps
forth
to
scale
the
walls
or
a
demosthenes
to
prevent
him
to
the
generals
he
gives
his
first
attention
listens
to
their
commands
their
counsels
and
their
determination
and
when
they
come
to
the
engagement
he
weighs
in
equal
scale
the
actions
of
both
and
closely
attends
the
pursuer
and
the
pursued
the
conqueror
and
the
conquered
all
this
must
be
done
with
temper
and
moderation
so
as
not
to
satiate
or
tire
not
inartificially
not
childishly
but
with
ease
and
grace
when
these
things
are
properly
taken
care
of
he
may
turn
aside
to
others
ever
ready
and
prepared
for
the
present
event
keeping
time
as
it
were
with
every
circumstance
and
event
flying
from
armenia
to
media
and
from
thence
with
clattering
wings
to
italy
or
to
iberia
that
not
a
moment
may
escape
him
the
mind
of
the
historian
should
resemble
a
shining
clear
and
exactly
true
representing
everything
as
it
really
is
and
nothing
distorted
or
of
a
different
form
or
colour
he
writes
not
to
the
masters
of
eloquence
but
simply
relates
what
is
done
it
is
not
his
to
consider
what
he
shall
say
but
only
how
it
is
to
be
said
he
may
be
compared
to
phidias
praxiteles
alcamenus
or
other
eminent
artists
for
neither
did
they
make
the
gold
the
silver
the
ivory
or
any
of
the
materials
which
they
worked
upon
these
were
supplied
by
the
elians
the
athenians
and
argives
their
only
business
was
to
cut
and
polish
the
ivory
to
spread
the
gold
into
various
forms
and
join
them
together
their
art
was
properly
to
dispose
what
was
put
into
their
hands
and
such
is
the
work
of
the
historians
to
dispose
and
adorn
the
actions
of
men
and
to
make
them
known
with
clearness
and
precision
to
represent
what
he
hath
heard
as
if
he
had
been
himself
an
of
it
to
perform
this
well
and
gain
the
praise
resulting
from
it
is
the
business
of
our
historical
phidias
when
everything
is
thus
prepared
he
may
begin
if
he
pleases
without
preface
or
exordium
unless
the
subject
particularly
demands
it
he
may
supply
the
place
of
one
by
informing
us
what
he
intends
to
write
upon
in
the
beginning
of
the
work
itself
if
however
he
makes
use
of
any
preface
he
need
not
divide
it
as
our
orators
do
into
three
parts
but
confine
it
to
two
leaving
out
his
address
to
the
benevolence
of
his
readers
and
only
soliciting
their
attention
and
complacency
their
attention
he
may
be
assured
of
if
he
can
convince
them
that
he
is
about
to
speak
of
things
great
or
necessary
or
interesting
or
useful
nor
need
he
fear
their
want
of
complacency
if
he
clearly
explains
to
them
the
causes
of
things
and
gives
them
the
heads
of
what
he
intends
to
treat
of
such
are
the
exordiums
which
our
best
historians
have
made
use
of
herodotus
tells
us
he
wrote
his
history
lest
in
process
of
time
the
memory
should
be
lost
of
those
things
which
in
themselves
were
great
and
wonderful
which
showed
forth
the
victories
of
greece
and
the
slaughter
of
the
barbarians
and
thucydides
sets
out
with
saying
he
thought
that
war
most
worthy
to
be
recorded
as
greater
than
any
which
had
before
happened
and
that
moreover
some
of
the
greatest
misfortunes
had
accompanied
it
the
exordium
in
short
may
be
lengthened
or
contracted
according
to
the
subject
matter
and
the
transition
from
thence
to
the
narration
easy
and
natural
the
body
of
the
history
is
only
a
long
narrative
and
as
such
it
must
go
on
with
a
soft
and
even
motion
alike
in
every
part
so
that
nothing
should
stand
too
forward
or
retreat
too
far
behind
above
all
the
style
should
be
clear
and
perspicuous
which
can
only
arise
as
i
before
observed
from
a
harmony
in
the
composition
one
thing
perfected
the
next
which
succeeds
should
be
coherent
with
it
knit
together
as
it
were
by
one
common
chain
which
must
never
be
broken
they
must
not
be
so
many
separate
and
distinct
narratives
but
each
so
closely
united
to
what
follows
as
to
appear
one
continued
series
brevity
is
always
necessary
especially
when
you
have
a
great
deal
to
say
and
this
must
be
proportioned
to
the
facts
and
circumstances
which
you
have
to
relate
in
general
you
must
slightly
run
through
little
things
and
dwell
longer
on
great
ones
when
you
treat
your
friends
you
give
them
boars
hares
and
other
dainties
you
would
not
offer
them
beans
saperda
or
any
other
common
food
when
you
describe
mountains
rivers
and
bulwarks
avoid
all
pomp
and
ostentation
as
if
you
meant
to
show
your
own
eloquence
pass
over
these
things
as
slightly
as
you
can
and
rather
aim
at
being
useful
and
intelligible
observe
how
the
great
and
sublime
homer
acts
on
these
occasions
as
great
a
poet
as
he
is
he
says
nothing
about
tantalus
ixion
tityus
and
the
rest
of
them
but
if
parthenius
euphorion
or
callimachus
had
treated
this
subject
what
a
number
of
verses
they
would
have
spent
in
rolling
wheel
and
bringing
the
water
up
to
the
very
lips
of
tantalus
mark
also
how
quickly
thucydides
who
is
very
sparing
of
his
descriptions
breaks
off
when
he
gives
an
account
of
any
military
machine
explains
the
manner
of
a
siege
even
though
it
be
ever
so
useful
and
necessary
or
describes
cities
or
the
port
of
syracuse
even
in
his
narrative
of
the
plague
which
seems
so
long
if
you
consider
the
multiplicity
of
events
you
will
find
he
makes
as
much
haste
as
possible
and
omits
many
circumstances
though
he
was
obliged
to
retain
so
many
more
when
it
is
necessary
to
make
any
one
speak
you
must
take
care
to
let
him
say
nothing
but
what
is
suitable
to
the
person
and
to
what
he
speaks
about
and
let
everything
be
clear
and
intelligible
here
indeed
you
may
be
permitted
to
play
the
orator
and
show
the
power
of
eloquence
with
regard
to
praise
or
dispraise
you
can
not
be
too
modest
and
circumspect
they
should
be
strictly
just
and
impartial
short
and
seasonable
your
evidence
otherwise
will
not
be
considered
as
legal
and
you
will
incur
the
same
censure
as
theopompus
did
who
finds
fault
with
everybody
from
enmity
and
and
dwells
so
perpetually
on
this
that
he
seems
rather
to
be
an
accuser
than
an
historian
if
anything
occurs
that
is
very
extraordinary
or
incredible
you
may
mention
without
vouching
for
the
truth
of
it
leaving
everybody
to
judge
for
themselves
concerning
it
by
taking
no
part
yourself
you
will
remain
safe
remember
above
all
and
throughout
your
work
again
and
again
i
must
repeat
it
that
you
write
not
with
a
view
to
the
present
times
only
that
the
age
you
live
in
may
applaud
and
esteem
you
but
with
an
eye
fixed
on
posterity
from
future
ages
expect
your
reward
that
men
may
say
of
you
that
man
was
full
of
honest
freedom
never
flattering
or
servile
but
in
all
things
the
friend
of
truth
this
commendation
the
wise
man
will
prefer
to
all
the
vain
hopes
of
this
life
which
are
but
of
short
duration
recollect
the
story
of
the
cnidian
architect
when
he
built
the
tower
in
pharos
where
the
fire
is
kindled
to
prevent
mariners
from
running
on
the
dangerous
rocks
of
paraetonia
that
most
noble
and
most
beautiful
of
all
works
he
carved
his
own
name
on
a
part
of
the
rock
on
the
inside
then
covered
it
over
with
mortar
and
inscribed
on
it
the
name
of
the
reigning
sovereign
well
knowing
that
as
it
afterwards
happened
in
a
short
space
of
time
these
letters
would
drop
off
with
the
mortar
and
discover
under
it
this
inscription
sostratus
the
cnidian
son
of
dexiphanes
to
those
gods
who
preserve
the
mariner
thus
had
he
regard
not
to
the
times
he
lived
in
not
to
his
own
short
existence
but
to
the
present
period
and
to
all
future
ages
even
as
long
as
his
tower
shall
stand
and
his
art
remain
upon
earth
thus
also
should
history
be
written
rather
anxious
to
gain
the
approbation
of
posterity
by
truth
and
merit
than
to
acquire
present
applause
by
adulation
and
falsehood
such
are
the
rules
which
i
would
prescribe
to
the
historian
and
which
will
contribute
to
the
perfection
of
his
work
if
he
thinks
proper
to
observe
them
if
not
at
least
i
have
rolled
my
tub
the
true
history
book
lucian
true
history
is
as
the
author
himself
acknowledges
in
the
preface
to
it
a
collection
of
ingenious
lies
calculated
principally
to
amuse
the
reader
not
without
several
allusions
as
he
informs
us
to
the
works
of
ancient
poets
historians
and
philosophers
as
well
as
most
probably
the
performances
of
contemporary
writers
whose
absurdities
are
either
obliquely
glanced
at
or
openly
ridiculed
and
exposed
we
can
not
but
lament
that
the
humour
of
the
greatest
part
of
these
allusions
must
be
lost
to
us
the
works
themselves
being
long
since
buried
in
oblivion
true
history
therefore
like
the
duke
of
buckingham
rehearsal
can
not
be
half
so
agreeable
as
when
it
was
first
written
there
is
however
enough
remaining
to
secure
it
from
contempt
the
vein
of
rich
fancy
and
wildness
of
a
luxuriant
imagination
which
run
through
the
whole
sufficiently
point
out
the
author
as
a
man
of
uncommon
genius
and
invention
the
reader
will
easily
perceive
that
bergerac
swift
and
other
writers
have
read
this
work
of
lucian
and
are
much
indebted
to
him
for
it
preface
as
athletics
of
all
kinds
hold
it
necessary
not
only
to
prepare
the
body
by
exercise
and
discipline
but
sometimes
to
give
it
proper
relaxation
which
they
esteem
no
less
requisite
so
do
i
think
it
highly
necessary
also
for
men
of
letters
after
their
severer
studies
to
relax
a
little
that
they
may
return
to
them
with
the
greater
pleasure
and
alacrity
and
for
this
purpose
there
is
no
better
repose
than
that
which
arises
from
the
reading
of
such
books
as
not
only
by
their
humour
and
pleasantry
may
entertain
them
but
convey
at
the
same
time
some
useful
instruction
both
which
i
flatter
myself
the
reader
will
meet
with
in
the
following
history
for
he
will
not
only
be
pleased
with
the
novelty
of
the
plan
and
the
variety
of
lies
which
i
have
told
with
an
air
of
truth
but
with
the
tacit
allusions
so
frequently
made
not
i
trust
without
some
degree
of
humour
to
our
ancient
poets
historians
and
philosophers
who
have
told
us
some
most
miraculous
and
incredible
stories
and
which
i
should
have
pointed
out
to
you
but
that
i
thought
they
would
be
sufficiently
visible
on
the
perusal
ctesias
the
cnidian
son
of
ctesiochus
wrote
an
account
of
india
and
of
things
there
which
he
never
saw
himself
nor
heard
from
anybody
else
iambulus
also
has
acquainted
us
with
many
wonders
which
he
met
with
in
the
great
sea
and
which
everybody
knew
to
be
absolute
falsehoods
the
work
however
was
not
unentertaining
besides
these
many
others
have
likewise
presented
us
with
their
own
travels
and
peregrinations
where
they
tell
us
of
wondrous
large
beasts
savage
men
and
ways
of
living
the
great
leader
and
master
of
all
this
rhodomontade
is
homer
ulysses
who
talks
to
alcinous
about
the
winds
pent
up
in
bags
and
cyclops
wild
men
creatures
with
many
heads
several
of
his
companions
turned
into
beasts
by
enchantment
and
a
thousand
things
of
this
kind
which
he
related
to
the
ignorant
and
credulous
phaeacians
these
notwithstanding
i
can
not
think
much
to
blame
for
their
falsehoods
seeing
that
the
custom
has
been
sometimes
authorised
even
by
the
pretenders
to
philosophy
i
only
wonder
that
they
should
ever
expect
to
be
believed
being
however
myself
incited
by
a
ridiculous
vanity
with
the
desire
of
transmitting
something
to
posterity
that
i
may
not
be
the
only
man
who
doth
not
indulge
himself
in
the
liberty
of
fiction
as
i
could
not
relate
anything
true
for
i
know
of
nothing
at
present
worthy
to
be
recorded
i
turned
my
thoughts
towards
falsehood
a
species
of
it
however
much
more
excusable
than
that
of
others
as
i
shall
at
least
say
one
thing
true
when
i
tell
you
that
i
lie
and
shall
hope
to
escape
the
general
censure
by
acknowledging
that
i
mean
to
speak
not
a
word
of
truth
throughout
know
ye
therefore
that
i
am
going
to
write
about
what
i
never
saw
myself
nor
experienced
nor
so
much
as
heard
from
anybody
else
and
what
is
more
of
such
things
as
neither
are
nor
ever
can
be
i
give
my
readers
warning
therefore
not
to
believe
me
once
upon
a
time
then
i
set
sail
from
the
pillars
of
hercules
and
getting
into
the
western
ocean
set
off
with
a
favourable
wind
the
cause
of
my
peregrination
was
no
more
than
a
certain
impatience
of
mind
and
thirst
after
novelty
with
a
desire
of
knowing
where
the
sea
ended
and
what
kind
of
men
inhabited
the
several
shores
of
it
for
this
purpose
i
laid
in
a
large
stock
of
provisions
and
as
much
water
as
i
thought
necessary
taking
along
with
me
fifty
companions
of
the
same
mind
as
myself
i
prepared
withal
a
number
of
arms
with
a
skilful
pilot
whom
we
hired
at
a
considerable
expense
and
made
our
ship
for
it
was
a
pinnace
as
tight
as
we
could
in
case
of
a
long
and
dangerous
voyage
we
sailed
on
with
a
prosperous
gale
for
a
day
and
a
night
but
being
still
in
sight
of
land
did
not
make
any
great
way
the
next
day
however
at
the
wind
springing
up
the
waves
ran
high
it
grew
dark
and
we
could
not
unfurl
a
sail
we
gave
ourselves
up
to
the
winds
and
waves
and
were
tossed
about
in
a
storm
which
raged
with
great
fury
for
threescore
and
nineteen
days
but
on
the
eightieth
the
sun
shone
bright
and
we
saw
not
far
from
us
an
island
high
and
woody
with
the
sea
round
it
quite
calm
and
placid
for
the
storm
was
over
we
landed
got
out
and
happy
to
escape
from
our
troubles
laid
ourselves
down
on
the
ground
for
some
time
after
which
we
arose
and
choosing
out
thirty
of
our
company
to
take
care
of
the
vessel
i
remained
on
shore
with
the
other
twenty
in
order
to
take
a
view
of
the
interior
part
of
the
island
about
three
stadia
from
the
sea
as
we
passed
through
a
wood
we
found
a
pillar
of
brass
with
a
greek
inscription
on
it
the
characters
almost
effaced
we
could
make
out
however
these
words
thus
far
came
hercules
and
bacchus
near
it
were
the
marks
of
two
footsteps
on
a
rock
one
of
them
measured
about
an
acre
the
other
something
less
the
smaller
one
appeared
to
me
to
be
that
of
bacchus
the
larger
that
of
hercules
we
paid
our
adorations
to
the
deities
and
proceeded
we
had
not
got
far
before
we
met
with
a
river
which
seemed
exactly
to
resemble
wine
particularly
that
of
chios
it
was
of
a
vast
extent
and
in
many
places
navigable
this
circumstance
induced
us
to
give
more
credit
to
the
inscription
on
the
pillar
when
we
perceived
such
visible
marks
of
presence
here
as
i
had
a
mind
to
know
whence
this
river
sprung
i
went
back
to
the
place
from
which
it
seemed
to
arise
but
could
not
trace
the
spring
i
found
however
several
large
vines
full
of
grapes
at
the
root
of
every
one
the
wine
flowed
in
great
abundance
and
from
them
i
suppose
the
river
was
collected
we
saw
a
great
quantity
of
fish
in
it
which
were
extremely
like
wine
both
in
taste
and
colour
and
after
we
had
taken
and
eaten
a
good
many
of
them
we
found
ourselves
intoxicated
and
when
we
cut
them
up
observed
that
they
were
full
of
grape
stones
it
occurred
to
us
afterwards
that
we
should
have
mixed
them
with
some
water
fish
as
by
themselves
they
tasted
rather
too
strong
of
the
wine
we
passed
the
river
in
a
part
of
it
which
was
fordable
and
a
little
farther
on
met
with
a
most
wonderful
species
of
vine
the
bottoms
of
them
that
touched
the
earth
were
green
and
thick
and
all
the
upper
part
most
beautiful
women
with
the
limbs
perfect
from
the
waist
only
that
from
the
tops
of
the
fingers
branches
sprung
out
full
of
grapes
just
as
daphne
is
represented
as
turned
into
a
tree
when
apollo
laid
hold
on
her
on
the
head
likewise
instead
of
hair
they
had
leaves
and
tendrils
when
we
came
up
to
them
they
addressed
us
some
in
the
lydian
tongue
some
in
the
indian
but
most
of
them
in
greek
they
would
not
suffer
us
to
taste
their
grapes
but
when
anybody
attempted
it
cried
out
as
if
they
were
hurt
we
left
them
and
returned
to
our
companions
in
the
ship
we
then
took
our
casks
filled
some
of
them
with
water
and
some
with
wine
from
the
river
slept
one
night
on
shore
and
the
next
morning
set
sail
the
wind
being
very
moderate
about
noon
the
island
being
now
out
of
sight
on
a
sudden
a
most
violent
whirlwind
arose
and
carried
the
ship
above
three
thousand
stadia
lifting
it
up
above
the
water
from
whence
it
did
not
let
us
down
again
into
the
seas
but
kept
us
suspended
in
mid
air
in
this
manner
we
hung
for
seven
days
and
nights
and
on
the
eighth
beheld
a
large
tract
of
land
like
an
island
round
shining
and
remarkably
full
of
light
we
got
on
shore
and
found
on
examination
that
it
was
cultivated
and
full
of
inhabitants
though
we
could
not
then
see
any
of
them
as
night
came
on
other
islands
appeared
some
large
others
small
and
of
a
fiery
colour
there
was
also
below
these
another
land
with
seas
woods
mountains
and
cities
in
it
and
this
we
took
to
be
our
native
country
as
we
were
advancing
forwards
we
were
seized
on
a
sudden
by
the
hippogypi
for
so
it
seems
they
were
called
by
the
inhabitants
these
hippogypi
are
men
carried
upon
vultures
which
they
ride
as
we
do
horses
these
vultures
have
each
three
heads
and
are
immensely
large
you
may
judge
of
their
size
when
i
tell
you
that
one
of
their
feathers
is
bigger
than
the
mast
of
a
ship
the
hippogypi
have
orders
it
seems
to
fly
round
the
kingdom
and
if
they
find
any
stranger
to
bring
him
to
the
king
they
took
us
therefore
and
carried
us
before
him
as
soon
as
he
saw
us
he
guessed
by
our
garb
what
we
were
you
are
grecians
said
he
are
you
not
we
told
him
we
were
and
how
added
he
got
ye
hither
through
the
air
we
told
him
everything
that
had
happened
to
us
and
he
in
return
related
to
us
his
own
history
and
informed
us
that
he
also
was
a
man
that
his
name
was
endymion
that
he
had
been
taken
away
from
our
earth
in
his
sleep
and
brought
to
this
place
where
he
reigned
as
sovereign
that
spot
he
told
us
which
now
looked
like
a
moon
to
us
was
the
earth
he
desired
us
withal
not
to
make
ourselves
uneasy
for
that
we
should
soon
have
everything
we
wanted
if
i
succeed
says
he
in
the
war
which
i
am
now
engaged
in
against
the
inhabitants
of
the
sun
you
will
be
very
happy
here
we
asked
him
then
what
enemies
he
had
and
what
the
quarrel
was
about
phaeton
he
replied
who
is
king
of
the
sun
for
that
is
inhabited
as
well
as
the
moon
has
been
at
war
with
us
for
some
time
past
the
foundation
of
it
was
this
i
had
formerly
an
intention
of
sending
some
of
the
poorest
of
my
subjects
to
establish
a
colony
in
lucifer
which
was
uninhabited
but
phaeton
out
of
envy
put
a
stop
to
it
by
opposing
me
in
the
with
his
hippomyrmices
we
were
overcome
and
desisted
our
forces
at
that
time
being
unequal
to
theirs
i
have
now
however
resolved
to
renew
the
war
and
fix
my
colony
if
you
have
a
mind
you
shall
accompany
us
in
the
expedition
i
will
furnish
you
everyone
with
a
royal
vulture
and
other
accoutrements
we
shall
set
out
with
all
my
heart
said
i
whenever
you
please
we
stayed
however
and
supped
with
him
and
rising
early
the
next
day
proceeded
with
the
army
when
the
spies
gave
us
notice
that
the
enemy
was
approaching
the
army
consisted
of
a
hundred
thousand
besides
the
scouts
and
engineers
together
with
the
auxiliaries
amongst
whom
were
eighty
thousand
hippogypi
and
twenty
thousand
who
were
mounted
on
the
lachanopteri
these
are
very
large
birds
whose
feathers
are
of
a
kind
of
herb
and
whose
wings
look
like
lettuces
next
to
these
stood
the
cinchroboli
and
the
schorodomachi
our
allies
from
the
north
were
three
thousand
psyllotoxotae
and
five
thousand
anemodromi
the
former
take
their
names
from
the
fleas
which
they
ride
upon
every
flea
being
as
big
as
twelve
elephants
the
latter
are
and
are
carried
about
in
the
air
without
wings
in
this
manner
they
have
large
gowns
hanging
down
to
their
feet
these
they
tuck
up
and
spread
in
a
form
of
a
sail
and
the
wind
drives
them
about
like
so
many
boats
in
the
battle
they
generally
wear
targets
it
was
reported
that
seventy
thousand
strathobalani
from
the
stars
over
cappadocia
were
to
be
there
together
with
five
thousand
hippogerani
these
i
did
not
see
for
they
never
came
i
shall
not
attempt
therefore
to
describe
them
of
these
however
most
wonderful
things
were
related
such
were
the
forces
of
endymion
their
arms
were
all
alike
their
helmets
were
made
of
beans
for
they
have
beans
there
of
a
prodigious
size
and
strength
and
their
scaly
of
lupines
sewed
together
for
the
skins
of
their
lupines
are
like
a
horn
and
impenetrable
their
shields
and
swords
the
same
as
our
own
the
army
ranged
themselves
in
this
manner
the
right
wing
was
formed
by
the
hippogypi
with
the
king
and
round
him
his
chosen
band
to
protect
him
amongst
which
we
were
admitted
on
the
left
were
the
lachanopteri
the
auxiliaries
in
the
middle
the
foot
were
in
all
about
sixty
thousand
myriads
they
have
spiders
you
must
know
in
this
country
in
infinite
numbers
and
of
pretty
large
dimensions
each
of
them
being
as
big
as
one
of
the
islands
of
the
cyclades
these
were
ordered
to
cover
the
air
from
the
moon
quite
to
the
morning
star
this
being
immediately
done
and
the
field
of
battle
prepared
the
infantry
was
drawn
up
under
the
command
of
nycterion
the
son
of
eudianax
the
left
wing
of
the
enemy
which
was
commanded
by
phaeton
himself
consisted
of
the
hippomyrmices
these
are
large
birds
and
resemble
our
ants
except
with
regard
to
size
the
largest
of
them
covering
two
acres
these
fight
with
their
horns
and
were
in
number
about
fifty
thousand
in
the
right
wing
were
the
aeroconopes
about
five
thousand
all
archers
and
riding
upon
large
gnats
to
these
succeeded
the
aerocoraces
light
infantry
but
remarkably
brave
and
useful
warriors
for
they
threw
out
of
slings
exceeding
large
radishes
which
whoever
was
struck
by
died
immediately
a
most
horrid
stench
exhaling
from
the
wound
they
are
said
indeed
to
dip
their
arrows
in
a
poisonous
kind
of
mallow
behind
these
stood
ten
thousand
caulomycetes
soldiers
who
fight
hand
to
hand
so
called
because
they
use
shields
made
of
mushrooms
and
spears
of
the
stalks
of
asparagus
near
them
were
placed
the
cynobalani
about
five
thousand
who
were
sent
by
the
inhabitants
of
sirius
these
were
men
with
dog
heads
and
mounted
upon
winged
acorns
some
of
their
forces
did
not
arrive
in
time
amongst
whom
there
were
to
have
been
some
slingers
from
the
together
with
the
nephelocentauri
they
indeed
came
when
the
first
battle
was
over
and
i
wish
they
had
never
come
at
all
the
slingers
did
not
appear
which
they
say
so
enraged
phaeton
that
he
set
their
city
on
fire
thus
prepared
the
enemy
began
the
attack
the
signal
being
given
and
the
asses
braying
on
each
side
for
such
are
the
trumpeters
they
make
use
of
on
these
occasions
the
left
wing
of
the
heliots
unable
to
sustain
the
onset
of
our
hippogypi
soon
gave
way
and
we
pursued
them
with
great
slaughter
their
right
wing
however
overcame
our
left
the
aeroconopes
falling
upon
us
with
astonishing
force
and
advancing
even
to
our
infantry
by
their
assistance
we
recovered
and
they
now
began
to
retreat
when
they
found
the
left
wing
had
been
beaten
the
defeat
then
becoming
general
many
of
them
were
taken
prisoners
and
many
slain
the
blood
flowed
in
such
abundance
that
the
clouds
were
tinged
with
it
and
looked
red
just
as
they
appear
to
us
at
sunset
from
thence
it
distilled
through
upon
the
earth
some
such
thing
i
suppose
happened
formerly
amongst
the
gods
which
made
homer
believe
that
jove
rained
blood
at
the
death
of
sarpedon
when
we
returned
from
our
pursuit
of
the
enemy
we
set
up
two
trophies
one
on
account
of
the
infantry
engagement
in
the
web
and
another
in
the
clouds
for
our
battle
in
the
air
thus
prosperously
everything
went
on
when
our
spies
informed
us
that
the
nephelocentaurs
who
should
have
been
with
phaeton
before
the
battle
were
just
arrived
they
made
indeed
as
they
approached
towards
us
a
most
formidable
appearance
being
half
winged
horses
and
half
men
the
men
from
the
waist
upwards
about
as
big
as
the
rhodian
colossus
and
the
horses
of
the
size
of
a
common
ship
of
burthen
i
have
not
mentioned
the
number
of
them
which
was
really
so
great
that
it
would
appear
incredible
they
were
commanded
by
sagittarius
from
the
zodiac
as
soon
as
they
learned
that
their
friends
had
been
defeated
they
sent
a
message
to
phaeton
to
call
him
back
whilst
they
put
their
forces
into
order
of
battle
and
immediately
fell
upon
the
selenites
who
were
unprepared
to
resist
them
being
all
employed
in
the
division
of
the
spoil
they
soon
put
them
to
flight
pursued
the
king
quite
to
his
own
city
and
slew
the
greatest
part
of
his
birds
they
then
tore
down
the
trophies
ran
over
all
the
field
woven
by
the
spiders
and
seized
me
and
two
of
my
companions
phaeton
at
length
coming
up
they
raised
other
trophies
for
themselves
as
for
us
we
were
carried
that
very
day
to
the
palace
of
the
sun
our
hands
bound
behind
us
by
a
cord
of
the
spider
web
the
conquerors
determined
not
to
besiege
the
city
of
the
moon
but
when
they
returned
home
resolved
to
build
a
wall
between
them
and
the
sun
that
his
rays
might
not
shine
upon
it
this
wall
was
double
and
made
of
thick
clouds
so
that
the
moon
was
always
eclipsed
and
in
perpetual
darkness
endymion
sorely
distressed
at
these
calamities
sent
an
embassy
humbly
beseeching
them
to
pull
down
the
wall
and
not
to
leave
him
in
utter
darkness
promising
to
pay
them
tribute
to
assist
them
with
his
forces
and
never
more
to
rebel
he
sent
hostages
withal
phaeton
called
two
councils
on
the
affair
at
the
first
of
which
they
were
all
inexorable
but
at
the
second
changed
their
opinion
a
treaty
at
length
was
agreed
to
on
these
conditions
the
heliots
and
their
allies
on
one
part
make
the
following
agreement
with
the
selenites
and
their
allies
on
the
other
that
the
heliots
shall
demolish
the
wall
now
erected
between
them
that
they
shall
make
no
irruptions
into
the
territories
of
the
moon
and
restore
the
prisoners
according
to
certain
articles
of
ransom
to
be
stipulated
concerning
them
that
the
selenites
shall
permit
all
the
other
stars
to
enjoy
their
rights
and
privileges
that
they
shall
never
wage
war
with
the
heliots
but
assist
them
whenever
they
shall
be
invaded
that
the
king
of
the
selenites
shall
pay
to
the
king
of
the
heliots
an
annual
tribute
of
ten
thousand
casks
of
dew
for
the
insurance
of
which
he
shall
send
ten
thousand
hostages
that
they
shall
mutually
send
out
a
colony
to
the
in
which
whoever
of
either
nation
shall
think
proper
may
become
a
member
that
the
treaty
shall
be
inscribed
on
a
column
of
amber
in
the
midst
of
the
air
and
on
the
borders
of
the
two
kingdoms
this
treaty
was
sworn
to
on
the
part
of
the
heliots
by
pyronides
and
therites
and
phlogius
and
on
the
part
of
the
selenites
by
nyctor
and
menarus
and
polylampus
such
was
the
peace
made
between
them
the
wall
was
immediately
pulled
down
and
we
were
set
at
liberty
when
we
returned
to
the
moon
our
companions
met
and
embraced
us
shedding
tears
of
joy
as
did
endymion
also
he
intreated
us
to
remain
there
or
to
go
along
with
the
new
colony
this
i
could
by
no
means
be
persuaded
to
but
begged
he
would
let
us
down
into
the
sea
as
he
found
i
could
not
be
prevailed
on
to
stay
after
feasting
us
most
nobly
for
seven
days
he
dismissed
us
i
will
now
tell
you
every
thing
which
i
met
with
in
the
moon
that
was
new
and
extraordinary
amongst
them
when
a
man
grows
old
he
does
not
die
but
dissolves
into
smoke
and
turns
to
air
they
all
eat
the
same
food
which
is
frogs
roasted
on
the
ashes
from
a
large
fire
of
these
they
have
plenty
which
fly
about
in
the
air
they
get
together
over
the
coals
snuff
up
the
scent
of
them
and
this
serves
them
for
victuals
their
drink
is
air
squeezed
into
a
cup
which
produces
a
kind
of
dew
he
who
is
quite
bald
is
esteemed
a
beauty
amongst
them
for
they
abominate
long
hair
whereas
in
the
comets
it
is
looked
upon
as
a
perfection
at
least
so
we
heard
from
some
strangers
who
were
speaking
of
them
they
have
notwithstanding
small
beards
a
little
above
the
knee
no
nails
to
their
feet
and
only
one
great
toe
they
have
honey
here
which
is
extremely
sharp
and
when
they
exercise
themselves
wash
their
bodies
with
milk
this
mixed
with
a
little
of
their
honey
makes
excellent
cheese
their
oil
is
extracted
from
onions
is
very
rich
and
smells
like
ointment
their
wines
which
are
in
great
abundance
yield
water
and
the
grape
stones
are
like
hail
i
imagine
indeed
that
whenever
the
wind
shakes
their
vines
and
bursts
the
grape
then
comes
down
amongst
us
what
we
call
hail
they
make
use
of
their
belly
which
they
can
open
and
shut
as
they
please
as
a
kind
of
bag
or
pouch
to
put
anything
in
they
want
it
has
no
liver
or
intestines
but
is
hairy
and
warm
within
insomuch
that
children
when
they
are
cold
frequently
creep
into
it
the
garments
of
the
rich
amongst
them
are
made
of
glass
but
very
soft
the
poor
have
woven
brass
which
they
have
here
in
great
abundance
and
by
pouring
a
little
water
over
it
so
manage
as
to
card
it
like
wool
i
am
afraid
to
mention
their
eyes
lest
from
the
incredibility
of
the
thing
you
should
not
believe
me
i
must
however
inform
you
that
they
have
eyes
which
they
take
in
and
out
whenever
they
please
so
that
they
can
preserve
them
anywhere
till
occasion
serves
and
then
make
use
of
them
many
who
have
lost
their
own
borrow
from
others
and
there
are
several
rich
men
who
keep
a
stock
of
eyes
by
them
their
ears
are
made
of
the
leaves
of
except
of
those
who
spring
as
i
observed
to
you
from
acorns
these
alone
have
wooden
ones
i
saw
likewise
another
very
extraordinary
thing
in
the
king
palace
which
was
a
that
is
placed
in
a
well
not
very
deep
whoever
goes
down
into
the
well
hears
everything
that
is
said
upon
earth
and
if
he
looks
into
the
glass
beholds
all
the
cities
and
nations
of
the
world
as
plain
as
if
he
was
close
to
them
i
myself
saw
several
of
my
friends
there
and
my
whole
native
country
whether
they
saw
me
also
i
will
not
pretend
to
affirm
he
who
does
not
believe
these
things
whenever
he
goes
there
will
know
that
i
have
said
nothing
but
what
is
true
to
return
to
our
voyage
we
took
our
leave
of
the
king
and
his
friends
got
on
board
our
ship
and
set
sail
endymion
made
me
a
present
of
two
glass
robes
two
brass
ones
and
a
whole
coat
of
armour
made
of
lupines
all
which
i
left
in
the
whale
belly
he
likewise
sent
with
us
a
thousand
hippogypi
who
escorted
us
five
hundred
stadia
we
sailed
by
several
places
and
at
length
reached
the
new
colony
of
the
where
we
landed
and
took
in
water
from
thence
we
steered
into
the
zodiac
leaving
the
sun
on
our
left
we
passed
close
by
his
territory
and
would
have
gone
ashore
many
of
our
companions
being
very
desirous
of
it
but
the
wind
would
not
permit
us
we
had
a
view
however
of
that
region
and
perceived
that
it
was
green
fertile
and
and
abounding
in
everything
necessary
and
agreeable
the
nephelocentaurs
who
are
mercenaries
in
the
service
of
phaeton
saw
us
and
flew
aboard
our
ship
but
recollecting
that
we
were
included
into
the
treaty
soon
departed
the
hippogypi
likewise
took
their
leave
of
us
all
the
next
night
and
day
we
continued
our
course
downwards
and
towards
evening
came
upon
lycnopolis
this
city
lies
between
the
pleiades
and
the
hyades
and
a
little
below
the
zodiac
we
landed
but
saw
no
men
only
a
number
of
lamps
running
to
and
fro
in
the
and
round
the
port
some
little
ones
the
poor
i
suppose
of
the
place
others
the
rich
and
great
among
them
very
large
light
and
splendid
every
one
had
its
habitation
or
candlestick
to
itself
and
its
own
proper
name
as
men
have
we
heard
them
speak
they
offered
us
no
injury
but
invited
us
in
the
most
hospitable
manner
we
were
afraid
notwithstanding
neither
would
any
of
us
venture
to
take
any
food
or
sleep
the
king
court
is
in
the
middle
of
the
city
here
he
sits
all
night
calls
every
one
by
name
and
if
they
do
not
appear
condemns
them
to
death
for
deserting
their
post
their
death
is
to
be
put
out
we
stood
by
and
heard
several
of
them
plead
their
excuses
for
here
i
found
my
own
lamp
talked
to
him
and
asked
him
how
things
went
on
at
home
he
told
me
everything
that
had
happened
we
stayed
there
one
night
and
next
day
loosing
our
anchor
sailed
off
very
near
the
clouds
where
we
saw
and
greatly
admired
the
city
of
coccygia
but
the
wind
would
not
permit
us
to
land
coronus
the
son
of
cottiphion
is
king
there
i
remember
aristophanes
the
poet
speaks
of
him
a
man
of
wisdom
and
veracity
the
truth
of
whose
writings
nobody
can
call
in
question
about
three
days
after
this
we
saw
the
ocean
very
plainly
but
no
land
except
those
regions
which
hang
in
the
air
and
which
appeared
to
us
all
bright
and
fiery
the
fourth
day
about
noon
the
wind
subsiding
we
got
safe
down
into
the
sea
no
sooner
did
we
touch
the
water
but
we
were
beyond
measure
rejoiced
we
immediately
gave
every
man
his
supper
as
much
as
we
could
afford
and
afterwards
jumped
into
the
sea
and
swam
for
it
was
quite
calm
and
serene
it
often
happens
that
prosperity
is
the
forerunner
of
the
greatest
misfortunes
we
had
sailed
but
two
days
in
the
sea
when
early
in
the
morning
of
the
third
at
we
beheld
on
a
sudden
several
whales
and
one
amongst
them
of
a
most
enormous
size
being
not
less
than
fifteen
hundred
stadia
in
length
he
came
up
to
us
with
his
mouth
wide
open
disturbing
the
sea
for
a
long
way
before
him
the
waves
dashing
round
on
every
side
he
whetted
his
teeth
which
looked
like
so
many
long
spears
and
were
white
as
ivory
we
embraced
and
took
leave
of
one
another
expecting
him
every
moment
he
came
near
and
swallowed
us
up
at
once
ship
and
all
he
did
not
however
crush
us
with
his
teeth
for
the
vessel
luckily
slipped
through
one
of
the
interstices
when
we
were
got
in
for
some
time
it
was
dark
and
we
could
see
nothing
but
the
whale
happening
to
gape
we
beheld
a
large
space
big
enough
to
hold
a
city
with
ten
thousand
men
in
it
in
the
middle
were
a
great
number
of
small
fish
several
animals
cut
in
pieces
sails
and
anchors
of
ships
bones
and
all
kinds
of
merchandise
there
was
likewise
a
good
quantity
of
land
and
hills
which
seemed
to
have
been
formed
of
the
mud
which
he
had
swallowed
there
was
also
a
wood
with
all
sorts
of
trees
in
it
herbs
of
every
kind
everything
in
short
seemed
to
vegetate
the
extent
of
this
might
be
about
two
hundred
and
forty
stadia
we
saw
also
several
gulls
and
kingfishers
making
their
nests
in
the
branches
at
our
first
arrival
in
these
regions
we
could
not
help
shedding
tears
in
a
little
time
however
i
roused
my
companions
and
we
repaired
our
vessel
after
which
we
sat
down
to
supper
on
what
the
place
afforded
fish
of
all
kinds
we
had
here
in
plenty
and
the
remainder
of
the
water
which
we
brought
with
us
from
the
when
we
got
up
the
next
day
as
often
as
the
whale
gaped
we
could
see
mountains
and
islands
sometimes
only
the
sky
and
plainly
perceived
by
our
motion
that
he
travelled
through
the
sea
at
a
great
rate
and
seemed
to
visit
every
part
of
it
at
length
when
our
abode
become
familiar
to
us
i
took
with
me
seven
of
my
companions
and
advanced
into
the
wood
in
order
to
see
everything
i
could
possibly
we
had
not
gone
above
five
stadia
before
we
met
with
a
temple
dedicated
to
neptune
as
we
learned
by
the
inscription
on
it
and
a
little
farther
on
several
sepulchres
monumental
stones
and
a
fountain
of
clear
water
we
heard
the
barking
of
a
dog
and
seeing
smoke
at
some
distance
from
us
concluded
there
must
be
some
habitation
not
far
off
we
got
on
as
fast
as
we
could
and
saw
an
old
man
and
a
boy
very
busy
in
cultivating
a
little
garden
and
watering
it
from
a
fountain
we
were
both
pleased
and
terrified
at
the
sight
and
they
as
you
may
suppose
on
their
part
not
less
affected
stood
fixed
in
astonishment
and
could
not
speak
after
some
time
however
who
are
you
said
the
old
man
and
whence
come
ye
are
you
daemons
of
the
sea
or
unfortunate
men
like
ourselves
for
such
we
are
born
and
bred
on
land
though
now
inhabitants
of
another
element
swimming
along
with
this
great
creature
who
carries
us
about
with
him
not
knowing
what
is
to
become
of
us
or
whether
we
are
alive
or
dead
to
which
i
replied
we
father
are
men
as
you
are
and
but
just
arrived
here
being
swallowed
up
together
with
our
ship
but
three
days
ago
we
came
this
way
to
see
what
the
wood
produced
for
it
seemed
large
and
full
of
trees
some
good
genius
led
us
towards
you
and
we
have
the
happiness
to
find
we
are
not
the
only
poor
creatures
shut
up
in
this
great
monster
but
give
us
an
account
of
your
adventures
let
us
know
who
you
are
and
how
you
came
here
he
would
not
however
tell
us
anything
himself
or
ask
us
any
questions
till
he
had
performed
the
rites
of
hospitality
he
took
us
into
his
house
therefore
where
he
had
got
beds
and
made
everything
very
commodious
here
he
presented
us
with
herbs
fruit
fish
and
wine
and
when
we
were
satisfied
began
to
inquire
into
our
history
when
i
acquainted
him
with
everything
that
had
happened
to
us
the
storm
we
met
with
our
adventures
in
the
island
our
sailing
through
the
air
the
war
from
our
first
setting
out
even
to
our
descent
into
the
whale
belly
he
expressed
his
astonishment
at
what
had
befallen
us
and
then
told
us
his
own
story
which
was
as
follows
strangers
said
he
i
am
a
cyprian
by
birth
and
left
my
country
to
merchandise
with
this
youth
who
is
my
son
and
several
servants
we
sailed
to
italy
with
goods
of
various
kinds
some
of
which
you
may
perhaps
have
seen
in
the
mouth
of
the
whale
we
came
as
far
as
sicily
with
a
prosperous
gale
when
a
violent
tempest
arose
and
we
were
tossed
about
in
the
ocean
for
three
days
where
we
were
swallowed
up
men
ship
and
all
by
the
whale
only
we
two
remaining
alive
after
burying
our
companions
we
built
a
temple
to
neptune
and
here
we
have
lived
ever
since
cultivating
our
little
garden
raising
herbs
and
eating
fish
or
fruit
the
wood
as
you
see
is
very
large
and
produces
many
vines
from
which
we
have
excellent
wine
there
is
likewise
a
fountain
which
perhaps
you
have
observed
of
fresh
and
very
cold
water
we
make
our
bed
of
leaves
have
fuel
sufficient
and
catch
a
great
many
birds
and
live
fish
getting
out
upon
the
gills
of
the
whale
there
we
wash
ourselves
when
we
please
there
is
a
salt
lake
about
twenty
stadia
round
which
produces
fish
of
all
kinds
and
where
we
row
about
in
a
little
boat
which
we
built
on
purpose
it
is
now
years
since
we
were
swallowed
up
everything
here
indeed
is
very
tolerable
except
our
neighbours
who
are
disagreeable
troublesome
savage
and
unsociable
and
are
there
more
replied
i
besides
ourselves
in
the
whale
a
great
many
said
he
and
those
very
unhospitable
and
of
a
most
horrible
appearance
towards
the
tail
on
the
western
parts
of
the
wood
live
the
tarichanes
a
people
with
eel
eyes
and
faces
like
crabs
bold
warlike
and
that
live
upon
raw
flesh
on
the
other
side
at
the
right
hand
wall
are
the
tritonomendetes
in
their
upper
parts
men
and
in
the
lower
resembling
weasels
on
the
left
are
the
carcinochires
and
the
thynnocephali
who
have
entered
into
a
league
offensive
and
defensive
with
each
other
the
middle
part
is
occupied
by
the
paguradae
and
the
psittopodes
a
warlike
nation
and
remarkably
the
eastern
parts
near
the
whale
mouth
being
washed
by
the
sea
are
most
of
them
uninhabited
i
have
some
of
these
however
on
condition
of
paying
an
annual
tribute
to
the
psittopodes
of
five
hundred
oysters
such
is
the
situation
of
this
country
our
difficulty
is
how
to
oppose
so
many
people
and
find
sustenance
for
ourselves
how
many
may
there
be
said
i
more
than
a
thousand
said
he
and
what
are
their
arms
nothing
replied
he
but
then
said
i
we
had
best
go
to
war
with
them
for
we
have
arms
and
they
none
if
we
conquer
them
we
shall
live
without
fear
for
the
future
this
was
immediately
agreed
upon
and
as
soon
as
we
returned
to
our
ship
we
began
to
prepare
the
cause
of
the
war
was
to
be
the
of
the
tribute
which
was
just
now
becoming
due
they
sent
to
demand
it
he
returned
a
contemptuous
answer
to
the
messengers
the
psittopodes
and
paguradae
were
both
highly
enraged
and
immediately
fell
upon
scintharus
for
that
was
the
old
man
name
in
a
most
violent
manner
we
expecting
to
be
attacked
sent
out
a
detachment
of
twenty
men
with
orders
to
lie
concealed
till
the
enemy
was
past
and
then
to
rise
upon
them
which
they
did
and
cut
off
their
rear
we
in
the
meantime
being
likewise
in
number
with
the
old
man
and
his
son
waited
their
coming
up
met
and
engaged
them
with
no
little
danger
till
at
length
they
fled
and
we
pursued
them
even
into
their
trenches
of
the
enemy
there
fell
an
hundred
and
twenty
we
lost
only
one
our
pilot
who
was
run
through
by
the
rib
of
a
mullet
that
day
and
the
night
after
it
we
remained
on
the
field
of
battle
and
erected
the
dried
backbone
of
a
dolphin
as
a
trophy
next
day
some
other
forces
who
had
heard
of
the
engagement
arrived
and
made
head
against
us
the
tarichanes
under
the
command
of
pelamus
in
the
right
wing
the
thynnocephali
on
the
left
and
the
carcinochires
in
the
middle
the
tritonomendetes
remained
neutral
not
choosing
to
assist
either
party
we
came
round
upon
all
the
rest
by
the
temple
of
neptune
and
with
a
hideous
cry
rushed
upon
them
as
they
were
unarmed
we
soon
put
them
to
flight
pursued
them
into
the
wood
and
took
possession
of
their
territory
they
sent
ambassadors
a
little
while
after
to
take
away
their
dead
and
propose
terms
of
peace
but
we
would
hear
of
no
treaty
and
attacking
them
the
next
day
obtained
a
complete
victory
and
cut
them
all
off
except
the
tritonomendetes
who
informed
of
what
had
passed
ran
away
up
to
the
whale
gills
and
from
thence
threw
themselves
into
the
sea
the
country
being
now
cleared
of
all
enemies
we
rambled
through
it
and
from
that
time
remained
without
fear
used
what
exercise
we
pleased
went
hunting
pruned
our
vines
gathered
our
fruit
and
lived
in
short
in
every
respect
like
men
put
together
in
a
large
prison
which
there
was
no
escaping
from
but
where
they
enjoy
everything
they
can
wish
for
in
ease
and
freedom
such
was
our
way
of
life
for
a
year
and
eight
months
on
the
fifteenth
day
of
the
ninth
month
about
the
second
opening
of
the
whale
mouth
for
this
he
did
once
every
hour
and
by
that
we
calculated
our
time
we
were
surprised
by
a
sudden
noise
like
the
clash
of
oars
being
greatly
alarmed
we
crept
up
into
the
mouth
where
standing
between
his
teeth
we
beheld
one
of
the
most
astonishing
spectacles
that
was
ever
seen
men
of
an
immense
size
each
of
them
not
less
than
half
a
stadium
in
length
sailing
on
islands
like
boats
i
know
what
i
am
saying
is
incredible
i
shall
proceed
notwithstanding
these
islands
were
long
but
not
very
high
and
about
a
hundred
stadia
in
circumference
there
were
about
of
these
men
in
each
of
them
besides
the
rowers
on
the
sides
who
rowed
with
large
cypresses
with
their
branches
and
leaves
on
in
the
stern
stood
a
pilot
raised
on
an
eminence
and
guiding
a
brazen
helm
on
the
forecastle
were
forty
immense
creatures
resembling
men
except
in
their
hair
which
was
all
a
flame
of
fire
so
that
they
had
no
occasion
for
helmets
these
were
armed
and
fought
most
furiously
the
wind
rushing
in
upon
the
wood
which
was
in
every
one
of
them
swelled
it
like
a
sail
and
drove
them
on
according
to
the
pilot
direction
and
thus
like
so
many
long
ships
the
islands
by
the
assistance
of
the
oars
also
moved
with
great
velocity
at
first
we
saw
only
two
or
three
but
afterwards
there
appeared
above
six
hundred
of
them
which
immediately
engaged
many
were
knocked
to
pieces
by
running
against
each
other
and
many
sunk
others
were
wedged
in
close
together
and
not
able
to
get
asunder
fought
desperately
those
who
were
near
the
prows
showed
the
greatest
alacrity
boarding
each
other
ships
and
making
terrible
havoc
none
however
were
taken
prisoners
for
they
made
use
of
large
sharks
chained
together
who
laid
hold
of
the
wood
and
kept
the
island
from
moving
they
threw
oysters
at
one
another
one
of
which
would
have
filled
a
waggon
and
sponges
of
an
acre
long
aeolocentaurus
was
admiral
of
one
of
the
fleets
and
thalassopotes
of
the
other
they
had
quarrelled
it
seems
about
some
booty
thalassopotes
as
it
was
reported
having
driven
away
a
large
tribe
of
dolphins
belonging
to
aeolocentaurus
this
we
picked
up
from
their
own
discourse
when
we
heard
them
mention
the
names
of
their
commanders
at
length
the
forces
of
aeolocentaurus
prevailed
and
sunk
about
a
hundred
and
fifty
of
the
islands
of
the
enemy
and
taking
three
more
with
the
men
in
them
the
rest
took
to
their
oars
and
fled
the
conquerors
pursued
them
a
little
way
and
in
the
evening
returned
to
the
wreck
seizing
the
remainder
of
the
enemy
vessels
and
getting
back
some
of
their
own
for
they
had
themselves
lost
no
less
than
fourscore
islands
in
the
engagement
they
erected
a
trophy
for
this
victory
hanging
one
of
the
conquered
islands
on
the
head
of
the
whale
which
they
fastened
their
hawsers
to
and
casting
anchor
close
to
him
for
they
had
anchors
immensely
large
and
strong
spent
the
night
there
in
the
morning
after
they
had
returned
thanks
and
sacrificed
on
the
back
of
the
whale
they
buried
their
dead
sung
their
io
paeans
and
sailed
off
such
was
the
battle
of
the
islands
book
ii
from
this
time
our
abode
in
the
whale
growing
rather
tedious
and
disagreeable
not
able
to
bear
it
any
longer
i
began
to
think
within
myself
how
we
might
make
our
escape
my
first
scheme
was
to
undermine
the
wall
and
get
out
there
and
accordingly
we
began
to
cut
away
but
after
getting
through
about
five
stadia
and
finding
it
was
to
no
purpose
we
left
off
digging
and
determined
to
set
fire
to
the
wood
which
we
imagined
would
destroy
the
whale
and
secure
us
a
safe
retreat
we
began
therefore
by
burning
the
parts
near
his
tail
for
seven
days
and
nights
he
never
felt
the
heat
but
on
the
eighth
we
perceived
he
grew
sick
for
he
opened
his
mouth
very
seldom
and
when
he
did
shut
it
again
immediately
on
the
tenth
and
the
eleventh
he
declined
visibly
and
began
to
stink
a
little
on
the
twelfth
it
occurred
to
us
which
we
had
never
thought
of
before
that
unless
whilst
he
was
gaping
somebody
could
prop
up
his
jaws
to
prevent
his
closing
them
we
were
in
danger
of
being
shut
up
in
the
carcase
and
perishing
there
we
placed
some
large
beams
therefore
in
his
mouth
got
our
ship
ready
and
took
in
water
and
everything
necessary
scintharus
was
to
be
our
pilot
the
next
day
the
whale
died
we
drew
our
vessel
through
the
interstices
of
his
teeth
and
let
her
down
from
thence
into
the
sea
then
getting
on
the
whale
back
sacrificed
to
neptune
near
the
spot
where
the
trophy
was
erected
here
we
stayed
three
days
it
being
a
dead
calm
and
on
the
fourth
set
sail
we
struck
upon
several
bodies
of
the
giants
that
had
been
slain
in
the
and
measured
them
with
the
greatest
astonishment
for
some
days
we
had
very
mild
and
temperate
weather
but
the
arising
it
grew
so
extremely
cold
that
the
whole
sea
was
froze
up
not
on
the
surface
only
but
three
or
four
hundred
feet
deep
so
that
we
got
out
and
walked
on
the
ice
the
frost
being
so
intense
that
we
could
not
bear
it
we
put
in
practice
the
following
scheme
which
scintharus
put
us
in
the
head
of
we
dug
a
cave
in
the
ice
where
we
remained
for
thirty
days
lighting
a
fire
and
living
upon
the
fish
which
we
found
in
it
but
our
provisions
failing
we
were
obliged
to
loosen
our
ship
which
was
stuck
fast
in
and
hoisting
a
sail
slid
along
through
the
ice
with
an
easy
pleasant
motion
on
the
fifth
day
from
that
time
it
grew
warm
the
ice
broke
and
it
was
all
water
again
after
sailing
about
three
hundred
stadia
we
fell
in
upon
a
little
deserted
island
here
we
took
in
water
for
ours
was
almost
gone
killed
with
our
arrows
two
wild
oxen
and
departed
these
oxen
had
horns
not
on
their
heads
but
as
momus
seemed
to
wish
under
their
eyes
a
little
beyond
this
we
got
into
a
sea
not
of
water
but
of
milk
and
upon
it
we
saw
an
island
full
of
vines
this
whole
island
was
one
compact
cheese
as
we
afterwards
experienced
by
many
a
good
meal
which
we
made
upon
it
and
is
in
length
twenty
stadia
the
vines
have
grapes
upon
them
which
yield
not
wine
but
milk
in
the
middle
of
the
island
was
a
temple
to
the
nereid
galataea
as
appeared
by
an
inscription
on
it
as
long
as
we
stayed
there
the
land
afforded
us
victuals
to
eat
and
the
vines
supplied
us
with
milk
to
drink
tyro
the
daughter
of
salmoneus
we
were
told
was
queen
of
it
neptune
having
after
her
death
conferred
that
dignity
upon
her
we
stopped
five
days
on
this
island
and
on
the
sixth
set
sail
with
a
small
breeze
which
gently
agitated
the
waves
and
on
the
eighth
changed
our
milky
sea
for
a
green
and
briny
one
where
we
saw
a
great
number
of
men
running
backwards
and
forwards
resembling
ourselves
in
every
part
except
the
feet
which
were
all
of
cork
whence
i
suppose
they
are
called
phellopodes
we
were
surprised
to
see
them
not
sinking
but
rising
high
above
the
waves
and
making
their
way
without
the
least
fear
or
apprehension
they
came
up
to
and
addressed
us
in
the
greek
tongue
telling
us
they
were
going
to
phello
their
native
country
they
accompanied
us
a
good
way
and
then
taking
their
leave
wished
us
a
good
voyage
a
little
after
we
saw
several
islands
amongst
which
to
the
left
of
us
stood
phello
to
which
these
men
were
going
a
city
built
in
the
middle
of
a
large
round
cork
towards
the
right
hand
and
at
a
considerable
distance
were
many
others
very
large
and
high
on
which
we
saw
a
prodigious
large
fire
fronting
the
prow
of
our
ship
we
had
a
view
of
one
very
broad
and
flat
and
which
seemed
to
be
about
five
hundred
stadia
off
as
we
approached
near
to
it
a
sweet
and
odoriferous
air
came
round
us
such
as
herodotus
tells
us
blows
from
arabia
felix
from
the
rose
the
narcissus
the
hyacinth
the
lily
the
violet
the
myrtle
the
laurel
and
the
vine
refreshed
with
these
delightful
odours
and
in
hopes
of
being
at
last
rewarded
for
our
long
sufferings
we
came
close
up
to
the
island
here
we
beheld
several
safe
and
spacious
harbours
with
clear
transparent
rivers
rolling
placidly
into
the
sea
meadows
woods
and
birds
of
all
kinds
chanting
melodiously
on
the
shore
and
on
the
trees
the
soft
and
sweet
air
fanning
the
branches
on
every
side
which
sent
forth
a
soft
harmonious
sound
like
the
playing
on
a
flute
at
the
same
time
we
heard
a
noise
not
of
riot
or
tumult
but
a
kind
of
joyful
and
convivial
sound
as
of
some
playing
on
the
lute
or
harp
with
others
joining
in
the
chorus
and
applauding
them
we
cast
anchor
and
landed
leaving
our
ship
in
the
harbour
with
scintharus
and
two
more
of
our
companions
as
we
were
walking
through
a
meadow
full
of
flowers
we
met
the
guardians
of
the
isle
who
immediately
chaining
us
with
manacles
of
roses
for
these
are
their
only
fetters
conducted
us
to
their
king
from
these
we
learned
on
our
journey
that
this
place
was
called
the
island
of
the
blessed
and
was
governed
by
rhadamanthus
we
were
carried
before
him
and
he
was
sitting
that
day
as
judge
to
try
some
causes
ours
was
the
fourth
in
order
the
first
was
that
of
ajax
telamonius
to
determine
whether
he
was
to
rank
with
the
heroes
or
not
the
accusation
ran
that
he
was
mad
and
had
made
an
end
of
himself
much
was
said
on
both
sides
at
length
rhadamanthus
pronounced
that
he
should
be
consigned
to
the
care
of
hippocrates
and
go
through
a
course
of
hellebore
after
which
he
might
be
admitted
to
the
symposium
the
second
was
a
love
affair
to
decide
whether
theseus
or
menelaus
should
possess
helen
in
these
regions
and
the
decree
of
rhadamanthus
was
that
she
should
live
with
menelaus
who
had
undergone
so
many
difficulties
and
dangers
for
her
besides
that
theseus
had
other
women
the
amazonian
lady
and
the
daughters
of
minos
the
third
cause
was
a
point
of
precedency
between
alexander
the
son
of
philip
and
hannibal
the
carthaginian
which
was
given
in
favour
of
alexander
who
was
placed
on
a
throne
next
to
the
elder
cyrus
the
persian
our
cause
came
on
the
last
the
king
asked
us
how
we
dared
to
enter
alone
as
we
were
into
that
sacred
abode
we
told
him
everything
that
had
happened
he
commanded
us
to
retire
and
consulted
with
the
assessors
concerning
us
there
were
many
in
council
with
him
and
amongst
them
aristides
the
just
athenian
and
pursuant
to
his
opinion
it
was
determined
that
we
should
suffer
the
punishment
of
our
bold
curiosity
after
our
deaths
but
at
present
might
remain
in
the
island
for
a
certain
limited
time
associate
with
the
heroes
and
then
depart
this
indulgence
was
not
to
exceed
seven
months
at
this
instant
our
chains
if
so
they
might
be
called
dropped
off
and
we
were
left
at
liberty
to
range
over
the
city
and
to
partake
of
the
feast
of
the
blessed
the
whole
city
was
of
gold
and
the
walls
of
emerald
the
seven
gates
were
all
made
out
of
one
trunk
of
the
the
pavement
within
the
walls
of
ivory
the
temples
of
the
gods
were
of
beryl
and
the
great
altars
on
which
they
offered
the
hecatombs
all
of
one
large
amethyst
round
the
city
flowed
a
river
of
the
most
precious
ointment
a
hundred
cubits
in
breadth
and
deep
enough
to
swim
in
the
baths
are
large
houses
of
glass
perfumed
with
cinnamon
and
instead
of
water
filled
with
warm
dew
for
clothes
they
wear
spider
webs
very
fine
and
of
a
purple
colour
they
have
no
bodies
but
only
the
appearance
of
them
insensible
to
the
touch
and
without
flesh
yet
they
stand
taste
move
and
speak
their
souls
seem
to
be
naked
and
separated
from
them
with
only
the
external
similitude
of
a
body
and
unless
you
attempt
to
touch
you
can
scarce
believe
but
they
have
one
they
are
a
kind
of
upright
shadows
only
not
black
in
this
place
nobody
ever
grows
old
at
whatever
age
they
enter
here
at
that
they
always
remain
they
have
no
night
nor
bright
day
but
a
perpetual
twilight
one
equal
season
reigns
throughout
the
year
it
is
always
spring
with
them
and
no
wind
blows
but
zephyrus
the
whole
region
abounds
in
sweet
flowers
and
shrubs
of
every
kind
their
vines
bear
twelve
times
in
the
year
yielding
fruit
every
month
their
apples
pomegranates
and
the
rest
of
our
autumnal
produce
thirteen
times
bearing
twice
in
the
month
of
minos
instead
of
corn
the
fields
bring
forth
loaves
of
bread
like
mushrooms
there
are
three
hundred
and
fountains
of
water
round
the
city
as
many
of
honey
and
five
hundred
rather
smaller
of
oil
besides
seven
rivers
of
milk
and
eight
of
wine
their
symposia
are
held
in
a
place
without
the
city
which
they
call
the
elysian
field
this
is
a
most
beautiful
meadow
skirted
by
a
large
and
thick
wood
affording
an
agreeable
shade
to
the
guests
who
repose
on
couches
of
flowers
the
winds
attend
upon
and
bring
them
everything
necessary
except
wine
which
is
otherwise
provided
for
there
are
large
trees
on
every
side
made
of
the
finest
glass
the
fruit
of
which
are
cups
of
various
shapes
and
sizes
whoever
comes
to
the
entertainment
gathers
one
or
more
of
these
cups
which
immediately
becomes
full
of
wine
and
so
they
drink
of
it
whilst
the
nightingales
and
other
birds
of
song
with
their
bills
peck
the
flowers
out
of
the
neighbouring
fields
and
drop
them
on
their
heads
thus
are
they
crowned
with
perpetual
garlands
their
manner
of
perfuming
them
is
this
the
clouds
suck
up
the
scented
oils
from
the
fountains
and
rivers
and
the
winds
gently
fanning
them
distil
it
like
soft
dew
on
those
who
are
assembled
there
at
supper
they
have
music
also
and
singing
particularly
the
verses
of
homer
who
is
himself
generally
at
the
feast
and
sits
next
above
ulysses
with
a
chorus
of
youths
and
virgins
he
is
led
in
accompanied
by
eunomus
the
locrian
arion
of
lesbos
anacreon
and
stesichorus
whom
i
saw
there
along
with
them
and
who
at
length
is
reconciled
to
helen
when
they
have
finished
their
songs
another
chorus
begins
of
swans
swallows
and
nightingales
and
to
these
succeeds
the
sweet
rustling
of
the
zephyrs
that
whistle
through
the
woods
and
close
the
concert
what
most
contributes
to
their
happiness
is
that
near
the
symposium
are
two
fountains
the
one
of
milk
the
other
of
pleasure
from
the
first
they
drink
at
the
beginning
of
the
feast
there
is
nothing
afterwards
but
joy
and
festivity
i
will
now
tell
you
what
men
of
renown
i
met
with
there
and
first
there
were
all
the
demigods
and
all
the
heroes
that
fought
at
troy
except
ajax
the
locrian
who
alone
it
seems
was
condemned
to
suffer
for
his
crimes
in
the
habitations
of
the
wicked
then
there
were
of
the
barbarians
both
the
cyruses
anacharsis
the
scythian
zamolxis
of
thrace
and
numa
the
italian
besides
these
i
met
with
lycurgus
the
spartan
phocion
and
tellus
of
athens
and
all
the
wise
men
except
periander
i
saw
also
socrates
the
son
of
sophroniscus
prating
with
nestor
and
palamedes
near
him
were
hyacinthus
of
sparta
narcissus
the
thespian
hylas
and
several
other
beauties
he
seemed
very
fond
of
hyacinthus
some
things
were
laid
to
his
charge
it
was
even
reported
that
rhadamanthus
was
very
angry
with
him
and
threatened
to
turn
him
out
of
the
island
if
he
continued
to
play
the
fool
and
would
not
leave
off
his
irony
and
sarcasm
of
all
the
philosophers
plato
alone
was
not
to
be
found
there
but
it
seems
he
lived
in
a
republic
of
his
own
building
and
which
was
governed
by
laws
framed
by
himself
aristippus
and
epicurus
were
in
the
highest
esteem
here
as
the
most
polite
benevolent
and
convivial
of
men
even
aesop
the
phrygian
was
here
whom
they
made
use
of
by
way
of
buffoon
diogenes
of
sinope
had
so
wonderfully
changed
his
manners
in
this
place
that
he
married
lais
the
harlot
danced
and
sang
got
drunk
and
played
a
thousand
freaks
not
one
stoic
did
i
see
amongst
them
they
it
seems
were
not
yet
got
up
to
the
top
of
the
high
hill
of
virtue
and
as
to
chrysippus
we
were
told
that
he
was
not
to
enter
the
island
till
he
had
taken
a
fourth
dose
of
hellebore
the
academicians
we
heard
were
very
desirous
of
coming
here
but
they
stood
doubting
and
deliberating
about
it
neither
were
they
quite
certain
whether
there
was
such
a
place
as
elysium
or
not
perhaps
they
were
afraid
of
rhadamanthus
judgment
on
them
as
decisive
judgments
are
what
they
would
never
allow
many
of
them
it
is
reported
followed
those
who
were
coming
to
the
island
but
being
too
lazy
to
proceed
turned
back
when
they
were
got
half
way
such
were
the
principal
persons
whom
i
met
with
here
achilles
is
had
in
the
greatest
honour
among
them
and
next
to
him
theseus
two
or
three
days
after
my
arrival
i
met
with
the
poet
homer
and
both
of
us
being
quite
at
leisure
asked
him
several
questions
and
amongst
the
rest
where
he
was
born
that
as
i
informed
him
having
been
long
a
matter
of
dispute
amongst
us
we
were
very
ignorant
indeed
he
said
for
some
had
made
him
a
chian
others
a
native
of
smyrna
others
of
colophon
but
that
after
all
he
was
a
babylonian
and
amongst
them
was
called
tigranes
though
after
being
a
hostage
in
greece
they
had
changed
his
name
to
homer
i
then
asked
him
about
those
of
his
verses
which
are
rejected
as
spurious
and
whether
they
were
his
or
not
he
said
they
were
all
his
own
which
made
me
laugh
at
the
nonsense
of
zenodotus
and
aristarchus
the
grammarians
i
then
asked
him
how
he
came
to
begin
his
iliad
with
the
wrath
of
achilles
he
said
it
was
all
by
chance
i
desired
likewise
to
know
whether
as
it
was
generally
reported
he
wrote
the
odyssey
before
the
iliad
he
said
no
it
is
commonly
said
he
was
blind
but
i
soon
found
he
was
not
so
for
he
made
use
of
his
eyes
and
looked
at
me
so
that
i
had
no
reason
to
ask
him
that
question
whenever
i
found
him
disengaged
i
took
the
opportunity
of
conversing
with
him
and
he
very
readily
entered
into
discourse
with
me
especially
after
the
victory
which
he
obtained
over
thersites
who
had
accused
him
of
turning
him
into
ridicule
in
some
of
his
verses
the
cause
was
heard
before
rhadamanthus
and
homer
came
off
victorious
ulysses
pleaded
for
him
i
met
also
pythagoras
the
samian
who
arrived
in
these
regions
after
his
soul
had
gone
a
long
round
in
the
bodies
of
several
animals
having
been
changed
seven
times
all
his
right
side
was
of
gold
and
there
was
some
dispute
whether
he
should
be
called
pythagoras
or
euphorbus
empedocles
came
likewise
who
looked
sodden
and
roasted
all
over
he
desired
admittance
but
though
he
begged
hard
for
it
was
rejected
a
little
time
after
the
games
came
on
which
they
call
here
thanatusia
achilles
presided
for
the
fifth
time
and
theseus
for
the
seventh
a
narrative
of
the
whole
would
be
tedious
i
shall
only
therefore
recount
a
few
of
the
principal
circumstances
in
the
wrestling
match
carus
a
descendant
of
hercules
conquered
ulysses
at
the
boxing
match
areus
the
egyptian
who
was
buried
at
corinth
and
epeus
contended
but
neither
got
the
victory
the
pancratia
was
not
proposed
amongst
them
in
the
race
i
do
not
remember
who
had
the
superiority
in
poetry
homer
was
far
beyond
them
all
hesiod
however
got
a
prize
the
reward
to
all
was
a
garland
of
feathers
when
the
games
were
over
word
was
brought
that
the
prisoners
in
tartarus
had
broken
loose
overcome
the
guard
and
were
proceeding
to
take
possession
of
the
island
under
the
command
of
phalaris
the
agrigentine
busiris
of
egypt
diomede
the
thracian
scyron
and
pityocamptes
as
soon
as
rhadamanthus
heard
of
it
he
despatched
the
heroes
to
the
shore
conducted
by
theseus
achilles
and
ajax
telamonius
who
was
now
returned
to
his
senses
a
battle
ensued
wherein
the
heroes
were
victorious
owing
principally
to
the
valour
of
achilles
socrates
who
was
placed
in
the
right
wing
behaved
much
better
than
he
had
done
at
delius
in
his
for
when
the
enemy
approached
he
never
fled
nor
so
much
as
turned
his
face
about
he
had
a
very
extraordinary
present
made
him
as
the
reward
of
his
courage
no
less
than
a
fine
spacious
garden
near
the
city
here
he
summoned
his
friends
and
disputed
calling
the
place
by
the
name
of
the
academy
of
the
dead
they
then
bound
the
prisoners
and
sent
them
back
to
tartarus
to
suffer
double
punishment
homer
wrote
an
account
of
this
battle
and
gave
it
me
to
show
it
to
our
people
when
i
went
back
but
i
lost
it
afterwards
together
with
a
great
many
other
things
it
began
thus
sing
muse
the
battles
of
the
heroes
dead
the
campaign
thus
happily
finished
they
made
an
entertainment
to
celebrate
the
victory
which
as
is
usual
amongst
them
was
a
feast
pythagoras
alone
absented
himself
on
that
day
and
fasted
holding
in
abomination
the
wicked
custom
of
eating
beans
six
months
had
now
elapsed
when
a
new
and
extraordinary
affair
happened
cinyrus
the
son
of
scintharus
a
tall
handsome
youth
fell
in
love
with
helen
and
she
no
less
desperately
with
him
they
were
often
nodding
and
drinking
to
one
another
at
the
public
feasts
and
would
frequently
rise
up
and
walk
out
together
alone
into
the
wood
the
violence
of
his
passion
joined
to
the
impossibility
of
possessing
her
any
other
way
put
cinyrus
on
the
resolution
of
running
away
with
her
she
imagined
that
they
might
easily
get
off
to
some
of
the
adjacent
islands
either
to
phellus
or
tyroessa
he
selected
three
of
the
bravest
of
our
crew
to
accompany
them
never
mentioning
the
design
to
his
father
who
he
knew
would
never
consent
to
it
but
the
first
favourable
opportunity
put
it
in
execution
and
one
night
when
i
was
not
with
them
for
it
happened
that
i
stayed
late
at
the
feast
and
slept
there
carried
her
off
menelaus
rising
in
the
middle
of
the
night
and
perceiving
that
his
wife
was
gone
made
a
dreadful
noise
about
it
and
taking
his
brother
along
with
him
proceeded
immediately
to
the
king
palace
at
break
of
day
the
guards
informed
him
that
they
had
seen
a
vessel
a
good
distance
from
land
he
immediately
put
fifty
heroes
on
board
a
ship
made
out
of
one
large
piece
of
the
asphodelus
with
orders
to
pursue
them
they
made
all
the
sail
they
possibly
could
and
about
noon
came
up
with
and
seized
on
them
just
as
they
were
entering
into
the
milky
sea
close
to
tyroessa
so
near
were
they
to
making
their
escape
the
pursuers
threw
a
rosy
chain
over
the
vessel
and
brought
her
home
again
helen
began
to
weep
blushed
and
hid
her
face
rhadamanthus
asked
cinyrus
and
the
rest
of
them
if
they
had
any
more
accomplices
they
told
him
they
had
none
he
then
ordered
them
to
be
chained
whipped
with
mallows
and
sent
to
tartarus
it
was
now
determined
that
we
should
stay
no
longer
on
the
island
than
the
time
limited
and
the
very
next
day
was
fixed
for
our
departure
this
gave
me
no
little
concern
and
i
wept
to
think
i
must
leave
so
many
good
things
and
be
once
more
a
wanderer
they
endeavoured
to
administer
consolation
to
me
by
assuring
me
that
in
a
few
years
i
should
return
to
them
again
they
even
pointed
out
the
seat
that
should
be
allotted
to
me
and
which
was
near
the
best
and
worthiest
inhabitants
of
these
delightful
mansions
i
addressed
myself
to
rhadamanthus
and
humbly
entreated
him
to
inform
me
of
my
future
fate
and
let
me
know
beforehand
whether
i
should
travel
he
told
me
that
after
many
toils
and
dangers
i
should
at
last
return
in
safety
to
my
native
country
but
would
not
point
out
the
time
when
he
then
showed
me
the
neighbouring
islands
five
of
which
appeared
near
to
me
and
a
sixth
at
a
distance
those
next
to
you
said
he
where
you
see
a
great
fire
burning
are
the
habitations
of
the
wicked
the
sixth
is
the
city
of
dreams
behind
that
lies
the
island
of
calypso
which
you
can
not
see
yet
when
you
get
beyond
these
you
will
come
to
a
large
tract
of
land
inhabited
by
those
who
live
on
the
side
of
the
earth
directly
opposite
to
you
there
you
will
suffer
many
things
wander
through
several
nations
and
meet
with
some
very
savage
and
unsociable
people
and
at
length
get
into
another
region
having
said
thus
he
took
a
root
of
mallow
out
of
the
earth
and
putting
it
into
my
hand
bade
me
remember
when
i
was
in
any
danger
to
call
upon
that
and
added
moreover
that
if
when
i
came
to
the
antipodes
i
took
care
never
to
stir
the
fire
with
a
sword
and
never
to
eat
lupines
i
might
have
hopes
of
returning
to
the
island
of
the
blessed
i
then
got
everything
ready
for
the
voyage
supped
with
and
took
my
leave
of
them
next
day
meeting
homer
i
begged
him
to
make
me
a
couple
of
verses
for
an
inscription
which
he
did
and
i
fixed
them
on
a
little
column
of
beryl
at
the
mouth
of
the
harbour
the
inscription
was
as
follows
dear
to
the
gods
and
favourite
of
heaven
here
lucian
lived
to
him
alone
was
given
well
pleased
these
happy
regions
to
explore
and
back
returning
seek
his
native
shore
i
stayed
that
day
and
the
next
set
sail
the
heroes
attending
to
take
their
leave
of
us
when
ulysses
unknown
to
penelope
slipped
a
letter
into
my
hand
for
calypso
at
the
island
of
ogygia
rhadamanthus
was
so
obliging
as
to
send
with
us
nauplius
the
pilot
that
if
we
stopped
at
the
neighbouring
islands
and
they
should
lay
hold
on
us
he
might
acquaint
them
that
we
were
only
on
our
passage
to
another
place
as
soon
as
we
got
out
of
the
air
we
came
into
another
that
smelt
of
asphaltus
pitch
and
sulphur
burning
together
with
a
most
intolerable
stench
as
of
burned
carcases
the
whole
element
above
us
was
dark
and
dismal
distilling
a
kind
of
pitchy
dew
upon
our
heads
we
heard
the
sound
of
stripes
and
the
yellings
of
men
in
torment
we
saw
but
one
of
these
islands
that
which
we
landed
on
i
will
give
you
some
description
of
every
part
of
it
was
steep
and
filthy
abounding
in
rocks
and
rough
mountains
we
crept
along
over
precipices
full
of
thorns
and
briers
and
passing
through
a
most
horrid
country
came
to
the
dungeon
and
place
of
punishment
which
we
beheld
with
an
admiration
full
of
horror
the
ground
was
strewed
with
swords
and
prongs
and
close
to
us
were
three
rivers
one
of
mire
another
of
blood
and
another
of
fire
immense
and
impassable
that
flowed
in
torrents
and
rolled
like
waves
in
the
sea
it
had
many
fish
in
it
some
like
torches
others
resembling
live
coals
which
they
called
lychnisci
there
is
but
one
entrance
into
the
three
rivers
and
at
the
mouth
of
them
stood
as
porter
timon
of
athens
by
the
assistance
however
of
our
guide
nauplius
we
proceeded
and
saw
several
punished
as
well
kings
as
private
persons
and
amongst
these
some
of
our
old
acquaintance
we
saw
cinyrus
hung
up
and
roasting
there
our
guides
gave
us
the
history
of
several
of
them
and
told
us
what
they
were
punished
for
those
we
observed
suffered
most
severely
who
in
their
lifetimes
had
told
lies
or
written
what
was
not
true
amongst
whom
were
ctesias
the
cnidian
herodotus
and
many
others
when
i
saw
these
i
began
to
conceive
good
hopes
of
hereafter
as
i
am
not
conscious
of
ever
having
told
a
story
not
able
to
bear
any
longer
such
melancholy
spectacles
we
took
our
leave
of
nauplius
and
returned
to
our
ship
in
a
short
time
after
we
had
a
view
but
confused
and
indistinct
of
the
island
of
dreams
which
itself
was
not
unlike
a
dream
for
as
we
approached
towards
it
it
seemed
as
it
were
to
retire
and
fly
from
us
at
last
however
we
got
up
to
it
and
entered
the
harbour
which
is
called
hypnus
near
the
ivory
gates
where
there
is
a
harbour
dedicated
to
the
cock
we
landed
late
in
the
evening
and
saw
several
dreams
of
various
kinds
i
propose
however
at
present
to
give
you
an
account
of
the
place
itself
which
nobody
has
ever
written
about
except
homer
whose
description
is
very
imperfect
round
the
island
is
a
very
thick
wood
the
trees
are
all
tall
poppies
or
mandragorae
in
which
are
a
great
number
of
bats
for
these
are
the
only
birds
they
have
here
there
is
likewise
a
river
which
they
call
nyctiporus
and
round
the
gates
two
fountains
the
name
of
one
is
negretos
and
of
the
other
pannychia
the
city
has
a
high
wall
of
all
the
colours
of
the
rainbow
it
has
not
two
gates
as
homer
tells
us
but
four
two
of
which
look
upon
the
plain
of
indolence
one
made
of
iron
the
other
of
brick
through
these
are
said
to
pass
all
the
dreams
that
are
frightful
bloody
and
melancholy
the
other
two
fronting
the
sea
and
harbour
one
of
horn
the
other
which
we
came
through
of
ivory
on
the
right
hand
as
you
enter
the
city
is
the
temple
of
night
who
together
with
the
cock
is
the
principal
object
of
worship
amongst
them
this
is
near
the
harbour
on
the
left
is
the
palace
of
somnus
for
he
is
their
sovereign
and
under
him
are
two
viceroys
taraxion
the
son
of
mataeogenes
and
plutocles
the
son
of
phantasion
in
the
middle
of
the
stands
a
fountain
which
they
call
careotis
and
two
temples
of
truth
and
falsehood
there
is
an
oracle
here
at
which
antiphon
presides
as
he
is
inventor
of
the
dreams
an
honourable
employment
which
somnus
bestowed
upon
him
the
dreams
themselves
are
of
different
kinds
some
long
beautiful
and
pleasant
others
little
and
ugly
there
are
likewise
some
golden
ones
others
poor
and
mean
some
winged
and
of
an
immense
size
others
tricked
out
as
it
were
for
pomps
and
ceremonies
for
gods
and
kings
some
we
met
with
that
we
had
seen
at
home
these
came
up
to
and
saluted
us
as
their
old
acquaintance
whilst
others
putting
us
first
to
sleep
treated
us
most
magnificently
and
promised
that
they
would
make
us
kings
and
noblemen
some
carried
us
into
our
own
country
showed
us
our
friends
and
relations
and
brought
us
back
again
the
same
day
thirty
days
and
nights
we
remained
in
this
place
being
most
luxuriously
feasted
and
fast
asleep
all
the
time
when
we
were
suddenly
awaked
by
a
violent
clap
of
thunder
and
immediately
ran
to
our
ship
put
in
our
stores
and
set
sail
in
three
days
we
reached
the
island
of
ogygia
before
we
landed
i
broke
open
the
letter
and
read
the
contents
which
were
as
follows
ulysses
to
calypso
this
comes
to
inform
you
that
after
my
departure
from
your
coasts
in
the
vessel
which
you
were
so
kind
as
to
provide
me
with
i
was
shipwrecked
and
saved
with
the
greatest
difficulty
by
leucothea
who
conveyed
me
to
the
country
of
the
phaeacians
and
from
thence
i
got
home
where
i
found
a
number
of
suitors
about
my
wife
revelling
there
at
my
expense
i
destroyed
every
one
of
them
and
was
afterwards
slain
myself
by
telegonus
a
son
whom
i
had
by
circe
i
still
lament
the
pleasures
which
i
left
behind
at
ogygia
and
the
immortality
which
you
promised
me
if
i
can
ever
find
an
opportunity
i
will
certainly
make
my
escape
from
hence
and
come
to
you
this
was
the
whole
of
the
epistle
except
that
at
the
end
of
it
he
recommended
us
to
her
protection
on
our
landing
at
a
little
distance
from
the
sea
i
found
the
cave
as
described
by
homer
and
in
it
calypso
spinning
she
took
the
letter
put
it
in
her
bosom
and
wept
then
invited
us
to
sit
down
and
treated
us
magnificently
she
then
asked
us
several
questions
about
ulysses
and
inquired
whether
penelope
was
handsome
and
as
chaste
as
ulysses
had
reported
her
to
be
we
answered
her
in
such
a
manner
as
we
thought
would
please
her
best
and
then
returning
to
our
ship
slept
on
board
close
to
the
shore
in
the
morning
a
brisk
gale
springing
up
we
set
sail
for
two
days
we
were
tossed
about
in
a
storm
the
third
drove
us
on
the
pirates
of
colocynthos
these
are
a
kind
of
savages
from
the
neighbouring
islands
who
commit
depredations
on
all
that
sail
that
way
they
have
large
ships
made
out
of
gourds
six
cubits
long
when
the
fruit
is
dry
they
hollow
and
work
it
into
this
shape
using
reeds
for
masts
and
making
their
sails
out
of
the
leaves
of
the
plant
they
joined
the
crews
of
two
ships
and
attacked
us
wounding
many
of
us
with
cucumber
seeds
which
they
threw
instead
of
stones
after
fighting
some
time
without
any
material
advantage
on
either
side
about
noon
we
saw
just
behind
them
some
of
the
caryonautae
whom
we
found
to
be
avowed
enemies
to
the
colocynthites
who
on
their
coming
up
immediately
quitted
us
and
fell
upon
them
we
hoisted
our
sail
and
got
off
leaving
them
to
fight
it
out
by
themselves
the
caryonautae
were
most
probably
the
conquerors
as
they
were
more
in
number
for
they
had
five
ships
which
besides
were
stronger
and
better
built
than
those
of
the
enemy
being
made
of
the
shells
of
nuts
cut
in
two
and
hollowed
every
being
fifty
paces
long
as
soon
as
we
got
out
of
their
sight
we
took
care
of
our
wounded
men
and
from
that
time
were
obliged
to
be
always
armed
and
prepared
in
case
of
sudden
attack
we
had
too
much
reason
to
fear
for
scarce
was
the
sun
set
when
we
saw
about
twenty
men
from
a
desert
island
advancing
towards
us
each
on
the
back
of
a
large
dolphin
these
were
pirates
also
the
dolphins
carried
them
very
safely
and
seemed
pleased
with
their
burden
neighing
like
horses
when
they
came
up
they
stood
at
a
little
distance
and
threw
dried
and
at
us
but
we
in
return
attacking
them
with
our
darts
and
arrows
many
of
them
were
wounded
and
unable
to
stand
it
any
longer
they
retreated
to
the
island
in
the
middle
of
the
night
the
sea
being
quite
calm
we
unfortunately
struck
upon
a
halcyon
nest
of
an
immense
size
being
about
sixty
stadia
in
circumference
the
halcyon
was
sitting
upon
it
and
was
herself
not
much
less
as
she
flew
off
she
was
very
near
oversetting
our
ship
with
the
wind
of
her
wings
and
as
she
went
made
a
most
hideous
groaning
as
soon
as
it
was
day
we
took
a
view
of
the
nest
which
was
like
a
great
ship
and
built
of
trees
in
it
were
five
hundred
eggs
each
of
them
longer
than
a
hogshead
of
chios
we
could
hear
the
young
ones
croaking
within
so
with
a
hatchet
we
broke
one
of
the
eggs
and
took
the
chicken
out
unfledged
it
was
bigger
than
twenty
vultures
put
together
when
we
were
got
about
two
hundred
stadia
from
the
nest
we
met
with
some
surprising
prodigies
a
cheniscus
came
and
sitting
on
the
prow
of
our
ship
clapped
his
wings
and
made
a
noise
our
pilot
scintharus
had
been
bald
for
many
years
when
on
a
sudden
his
hair
came
again
but
what
was
still
more
wonderful
the
mast
of
our
ship
sprouted
out
sent
forth
several
branches
and
bore
fruit
at
the
top
of
it
large
figs
and
grapes
not
quite
ripe
we
were
greatly
astonished
as
you
may
suppose
and
prayed
most
devoutly
to
the
gods
to
avert
the
evil
which
was
portended
we
had
not
gone
above
five
hundred
stadia
farther
before
we
saw
an
immensely
large
and
thick
wood
of
pines
and
cypresses
we
took
it
for
a
tract
of
land
but
it
was
all
a
deep
sea
planted
with
trees
that
had
no
root
which
stood
however
unmoved
upright
and
as
it
were
swimming
in
it
approaching
near
to
it
we
began
to
consider
what
we
could
do
best
there
was
no
sailing
between
the
trees
which
were
close
together
nor
did
we
know
how
to
get
back
i
got
upon
one
of
the
highest
of
them
to
see
how
far
they
reached
and
perceived
that
they
continued
for
about
fifty
stadia
or
more
and
beyond
that
it
was
all
sea
again
we
resolved
therefore
to
drag
the
ship
up
to
the
top
boughs
which
were
very
thick
and
so
convey
it
along
which
by
fixing
a
great
rope
to
it
with
no
little
toil
and
difficulty
we
performed
got
it
up
spread
our
sails
and
were
driven
on
by
the
wind
it
put
me
in
mind
of
that
verse
of
antimachus
the
poet
where
he
says
the
ship
sailed
smoothly
through
the
sylvan
sea
we
at
length
got
over
the
wood
and
letting
our
ship
down
in
the
same
manner
fell
into
smooth
clear
water
till
we
came
to
a
horrid
precipice
hollow
and
deep
resembling
the
cavity
made
by
an
earthquake
we
furled
our
sails
or
should
soon
have
been
swallowed
up
in
it
stooping
forward
and
looking
down
we
beheld
a
gulf
of
at
least
a
thousand
stadia
deep
a
most
dreadful
and
amazing
sight
for
the
sea
as
it
were
was
split
in
two
looking
towards
our
right
hand
however
we
saw
a
small
bridge
of
water
that
joined
the
two
seas
and
flowed
from
one
into
the
other
we
got
the
ship
in
here
and
with
great
labour
rowed
her
over
which
we
never
expected
from
thence
we
passed
into
a
smooth
and
calm
sea
wherein
was
a
small
island
with
a
good
landing
place
and
which
was
inhabited
by
the
bucephali
a
savage
race
of
men
with
bulls
heads
and
horns
as
they
paint
the
minotaur
as
soon
as
we
got
on
shore
we
went
in
search
of
water
and
provision
for
we
had
none
left
water
we
found
soon
but
nothing
else
we
heard
indeed
a
kind
of
lowing
at
a
distance
and
expected
to
find
a
herd
of
oxen
but
advancing
a
little
farther
perceived
that
it
came
from
the
men
as
soon
as
they
saw
us
they
ran
after
and
took
two
of
our
companions
the
rest
of
us
got
back
to
the
ship
as
fast
as
we
could
we
then
got
our
arms
and
determined
to
revenge
our
friends
attacked
them
as
they
were
dividing
the
flesh
of
our
poor
companions
they
were
soon
thrown
into
confusion
and
totally
routed
we
slew
about
fifty
of
them
and
took
two
prisoners
whom
we
returned
with
all
this
time
we
could
get
no
provision
some
were
for
putting
the
captives
to
death
but
not
approving
of
this
i
kept
them
bound
till
the
enemy
should
send
ambassadors
to
redeem
them
which
they
did
for
we
soon
heard
them
lowing
in
a
melancholy
tone
and
most
humbly
beseeching
us
to
release
their
friends
the
ransom
agreed
on
was
a
quantity
of
cheeses
dried
fish
and
onions
together
with
four
stags
each
having
three
feet
two
behind
and
one
before
in
consideration
of
this
we
released
the
prisoners
stayed
one
day
there
and
set
sail
we
soon
observed
the
fish
swimming
and
the
birds
flying
round
about
us
with
other
signs
of
our
being
near
the
land
and
in
a
very
little
time
after
saw
some
men
in
the
sea
who
made
use
of
a
very
uncommon
method
of
sailing
being
themselves
both
ships
and
passengers
i
will
tell
you
how
they
did
it
they
laid
themselves
all
along
in
the
water
they
fastened
to
their
middle
a
sail
and
holding
the
lower
part
of
the
rope
in
their
hands
were
carried
along
by
the
wind
others
we
saw
sitting
on
large
casks
driving
two
dolphins
who
were
yoked
together
and
drew
the
carriage
after
them
these
did
not
run
away
from
nor
attempt
to
do
us
any
injury
but
rode
round
about
us
without
fear
observing
our
vessel
with
great
attention
and
seeming
greatly
astonished
at
it
it
was
now
almost
dark
when
we
came
in
sight
of
a
small
island
inhabited
by
women
as
we
imagined
for
such
they
appeared
to
us
being
all
young
and
handsome
with
long
garments
reaching
to
their
feet
the
island
was
called
cabalusa
and
the
city
hydamardia
i
stopped
a
little
for
my
mind
misgave
me
and
looking
round
saw
several
bones
and
skulls
of
men
on
the
ground
to
make
a
noise
call
my
companions
together
and
take
up
arms
i
thought
would
be
imprudent
i
pulled
out
my
mallow
therefore
and
prayed
most
devoutly
that
i
might
escape
the
present
evil
and
a
little
time
afterwards
as
one
of
the
strangers
was
helping
us
to
something
i
perceived
instead
of
a
woman
foot
the
hoof
of
an
ass
upon
this
i
drew
my
sword
seized
on
and
bound
her
and
insisted
on
her
telling
me
the
truth
with
regard
to
everything
about
them
she
informed
me
much
against
her
will
that
she
and
the
rest
of
the
inhabitants
were
women
belonging
to
the
sea
that
they
were
called
onoscileas
and
that
they
lived
upon
travellers
who
came
that
way
we
make
them
drunk
said
she
and
when
they
are
asleep
make
an
end
of
them
as
soon
as
she
had
told
me
this
i
left
her
bound
there
and
getting
upon
the
house
called
out
to
my
companions
brought
them
together
showed
them
the
bones
and
led
them
in
to
her
when
on
a
sudden
she
dissolved
away
into
water
and
disappeared
i
dipped
my
sword
into
it
by
way
of
experiment
and
the
water
turned
into
blood
we
proceeded
immediately
to
our
vessel
and
departed
at
break
of
day
we
had
a
view
of
that
continent
which
we
suppose
lies
directly
opposite
to
our
own
here
after
performing
our
religious
rites
and
putting
up
our
prayers
we
consulted
together
about
what
was
to
be
done
next
some
were
of
opinion
that
after
making
a
little
descent
on
the
coast
we
should
turn
back
again
others
were
for
leaving
the
ship
there
and
marching
up
into
the
heart
of
the
country
to
explore
the
inhabitants
whilst
we
were
thus
disputing
a
violent
storm
arose
and
driving
our
ship
towards
the
land
split
it
in
pieces
we
picked
up
our
arms
and
what
little
things
we
could
lay
hold
on
and
with
difficulty
swam
ashore
such
were
the
adventures
which
befell
us
during
our
voyage
at
sea
in
the
islands
in
the
air
in
the
whale
amongst
the
heroes
in
the
land
of
dreams
and
lastly
amongst
the
bucephali
and
the
onoscileae
what
we
met
with
on
the
other
side
of
the
world
shall
be
related
in
the
ensuing
books
a
dialogue
this
dialogue
which
is
also
called
by
the
commentators
greek
or
above
the
clouds
has
a
great
deal
of
easy
wit
and
humour
in
it
without
the
least
degree
of
stiffness
or
obscurity
it
is
equally
severe
on
the
gods
and
philosophers
and
paints
in
the
warmest
colours
the
glaring
absurdity
of
the
whole
pagan
system
menippus
and
a
friend
menippus
three
thousand
stadia
from
the
earth
to
the
moon
my
first
from
thence
up
to
the
sun
about
five
hundred
parasangas
and
from
the
sun
to
the
highest
heaven
and
the
palace
of
jupiter
as
far
as
a
swift
eagle
could
fly
in
a
day
friend
what
are
you
muttering
to
yourself
menippus
talking
about
the
stars
and
pretending
to
measure
distances
as
i
walk
behind
you
i
hear
of
nothing
but
suns
and
moons
parasangas
stations
and
i
know
not
what
menippus
marvel
not
my
friend
if
i
utter
things
aerial
and
sublime
for
i
am
recounting
the
wonders
of
my
late
journey
friend
what
tracing
your
road
by
the
stars
as
the
phoenicians
do
menippus
not
so
by
jove
i
have
been
amongst
the
stars
themselves
friend
you
must
have
had
a
long
dream
indeed
to
travel
so
many
leagues
in
it
menippus
it
is
no
dream
i
assure
you
i
am
just
arrived
from
jupiter
friend
how
say
you
menippus
let
down
from
heaven
menippus
even
so
this
moment
come
from
thence
where
i
have
seen
and
heard
things
most
strange
and
miraculous
if
you
doubt
the
truth
of
them
the
happier
shall
i
be
to
have
seen
what
is
past
belief
friend
how
is
it
possible
most
heavenly
and
divine
menippus
that
a
mere
mortal
like
me
should
dispute
the
veracity
of
one
who
has
been
carried
above
the
clouds
one
to
speak
in
the
language
of
homer
of
the
inhabitants
of
heaven
but
inform
me
i
beseech
you
which
way
you
got
up
and
how
you
procured
so
many
ladders
for
by
your
appearance
i
should
not
take
you
for
another
phrygian
boy
to
be
carried
up
by
an
eagle
and
made
a
of
menippus
you
are
an
old
scoffer
i
know
and
therefore
i
am
not
surprised
that
an
account
of
things
above
the
comprehensions
of
the
vulgar
should
appear
like
a
fable
to
you
but
let
me
tell
you
i
wanted
no
ladders
nor
an
eagle
beak
to
transport
me
thither
for
i
had
wings
of
my
own
friend
this
was
beyond
daedalus
himself
to
be
metamorphosed
thus
into
a
hawk
or
jay
and
we
know
nothing
of
it
menippus
you
are
not
far
from
the
mark
my
friend
for
my
wings
were
a
kind
of
daedalian
contrivance
friend
thou
art
a
bold
rogue
indeed
and
meant
no
doubt
if
you
had
chanced
to
fall
into
any
part
of
the
ocean
to
have
called
it
as
icarus
did
by
your
own
name
and
styled
it
the
menippean
sea
menippus
not
so
his
wings
were
glued
on
with
wax
and
when
the
sun
melted
it
could
not
escape
falling
but
mine
had
no
wax
in
them
friend
indeed
now
shall
i
quickly
know
the
truth
of
this
affair
menippus
you
shall
i
took
you
must
know
a
very
large
eagle
and
a
vulture
also
one
of
the
strongest
i
could
get
and
cut
off
their
wings
but
if
you
have
leisure
i
will
tell
you
the
whole
expedition
from
beginning
to
end
friend
pray
do
for
i
long
to
hear
it
by
jove
the
friendly
i
entreat
thee
keep
me
no
longer
in
suspense
for
i
am
hung
by
the
ears
menippus
listen
then
for
i
would
by
no
means
baulk
an
inquisitive
friend
especially
one
who
is
nailed
by
the
ears
as
you
are
finding
on
a
close
examination
that
everything
here
below
such
as
riches
honours
empire
and
dominion
were
all
ridiculous
and
absurd
of
no
real
value
or
estimation
considering
them
withal
as
so
many
obstacles
to
the
study
of
things
more
worthy
of
contemplation
i
looked
up
towards
nobler
objects
and
meditated
on
the
great
universe
before
me
doubts
immediately
arose
concerning
what
philosophers
call
the
world
nor
could
i
discover
how
it
came
into
existence
its
creator
the
beginning
or
the
end
of
it
when
i
descended
to
its
several
parts
i
was
still
more
in
the
dark
i
beheld
the
stars
scattered
as
it
were
by
the
hand
of
chance
over
the
heavens
i
saw
the
sun
and
wished
to
know
what
it
was
above
all
the
nature
of
the
moon
appeared
to
me
most
wonderful
and
extraordinary
the
diversity
of
its
forms
pointed
out
some
hidden
cause
which
i
could
not
account
for
the
lightning
also
which
pierces
through
everything
the
impetuous
thunder
the
rain
hail
and
snow
all
raised
my
admiration
and
seemed
inexplicable
to
human
reason
in
this
situation
of
mind
the
best
thing
i
thought
which
i
could
possibly
do
was
to
consult
the
philosophers
they
i
made
no
doubt
were
acquainted
with
the
truth
and
could
impart
it
to
me
selecting
therefore
the
best
of
them
as
well
as
i
could
judge
from
the
paleness
and
severity
of
their
countenances
and
the
length
of
their
beards
for
they
seemed
all
to
be
and
men
into
the
hands
of
these
i
entirely
resigned
myself
and
partly
by
ready
money
partly
by
the
promise
of
more
when
they
had
made
me
completely
wise
i
engaged
them
to
teach
me
the
perfect
knowledge
of
the
universe
and
how
to
talk
on
sublime
subjects
but
so
far
were
they
from
removing
my
ignorance
that
they
only
threw
me
into
greater
doubt
and
uncertainty
by
puzzling
me
with
atoms
vacuums
beginnings
ends
ideas
forms
and
so
forth
and
the
worst
of
all
was
that
though
none
agreed
with
the
rest
in
what
they
advanced
but
were
all
of
contrary
opinions
yet
did
every
one
of
them
expect
that
i
should
implicitly
embrace
his
tenets
and
subscribe
to
his
doctrine
friend
it
is
astonishing
that
such
wise
men
should
disagree
and
with
regard
to
the
same
things
should
not
all
be
of
the
same
opinion
menippus
you
will
laugh
my
friend
when
i
shall
tell
you
of
their
pride
and
impudence
in
the
relation
of
extraordinary
events
to
think
that
men
who
creep
upon
this
earth
and
are
not
a
whit
wiser
or
can
see
farther
than
ourselves
some
of
them
old
blind
and
lazy
should
pretend
to
know
the
limits
and
extent
of
heaven
measure
the
circuit
and
walk
above
the
moon
that
they
should
tell
us
the
size
and
form
of
the
stars
as
if
they
were
just
come
down
from
them
that
those
who
scarcely
know
how
many
furlongs
it
is
from
athens
to
megara
should
inform
you
exactly
how
many
cubits
distance
the
sun
is
from
the
moon
should
mark
out
the
height
of
the
air
and
the
depth
of
the
sea
describe
circles
from
squares
upon
triangles
make
spheres
and
determine
the
length
and
breadth
of
heaven
itself
is
it
not
to
the
last
degree
impudent
and
audacious
when
they
talk
of
things
thus
obscure
and
unintelligible
not
merely
to
offer
their
opinions
as
conjectures
but
boldly
to
urge
and
insist
upon
them
to
do
everything
but
swear
that
the
sun
is
a
mass
of
liquid
fire
that
the
moon
is
inhabited
that
the
stars
drink
water
and
that
the
sun
draws
up
the
moisture
from
the
sea
as
with
a
rope
and
distributes
his
draught
over
the
whole
creation
how
little
they
agree
upon
any
one
thing
and
what
a
variety
of
tenets
they
embrace
is
but
too
evident
for
first
with
regard
to
the
world
their
opinions
are
totally
different
some
affirm
that
it
hath
neither
beginning
nor
end
some
whom
i
can
not
but
admire
point
out
to
us
the
manner
of
its
construction
and
the
maker
of
it
a
supreme
deity
whom
they
worship
as
creator
of
the
universe
but
they
have
not
told
us
whence
he
came
nor
where
he
exists
neither
before
the
formation
of
this
world
can
we
have
any
idea
of
time
or
place
friend
these
are
indeed
bold
and
presumptuous
diviners
menippus
but
what
would
you
say
my
dear
friend
were
you
to
hear
them
disputing
concerning
ideal
and
incorporeal
substances
and
talking
about
finite
and
infinite
for
this
is
a
principal
matter
of
contention
between
them
some
confining
all
things
within
certain
limits
others
prescribing
none
some
assert
that
there
are
many
worlds
and
laugh
at
those
who
affirm
there
is
but
one
whilst
another
no
man
of
peace
gravely
assures
us
that
war
is
the
original
parent
of
all
things
need
i
mention
to
you
their
strange
opinions
concerning
the
deities
one
says
that
number
is
a
god
others
swear
by
dogs
geese
and
some
give
the
rule
of
everything
to
one
god
alone
and
take
away
all
power
from
the
rest
a
scarcity
of
deities
which
i
could
not
well
brook
others
more
liberal
increased
the
number
of
gods
and
gave
to
each
his
separate
province
and
employment
calling
one
the
first
and
allotting
to
others
the
second
or
third
rank
of
divinity
some
held
that
gods
were
incorporeal
and
without
form
others
supposed
them
to
have
bodies
it
was
by
no
means
universally
acknowledged
that
the
gods
took
cognisance
of
human
affairs
some
there
were
who
exempted
them
from
all
care
and
solicitude
as
we
exonerate
our
old
men
from
business
and
trouble
bringing
them
in
like
so
many
mute
attendants
on
the
stage
there
are
some
too
who
go
beyond
all
this
and
deny
that
there
are
any
gods
at
all
but
assert
that
the
world
is
left
without
any
guide
or
master
i
could
not
tell
how
to
refuse
my
assent
to
these
and
gentlemen
and
yet
could
find
no
argument
amongst
them
all
that
had
not
been
refuted
by
some
or
other
of
them
often
was
i
on
the
point
of
giving
credit
to
one
when
as
homer
says
to
other
thoughts
my
heart
inclined
the
only
way
therefore
to
put
an
end
to
all
my
doubts
was
i
thought
to
make
a
bird
of
myself
and
fly
up
to
heaven
this
my
own
eager
desires
represented
as
probable
and
the
aesop
confirmed
it
who
carries
up
not
only
his
eagles
but
his
beetles
and
camels
thither
to
make
wings
for
myself
was
impossible
but
to
fit
those
of
a
vulture
and
an
eagle
to
my
body
might
i
imagined
answer
the
same
purpose
i
resolved
therefore
to
try
the
experiment
and
cut
off
the
right
wing
of
one
and
the
left
of
the
other
bound
them
on
with
thongs
and
at
the
extremities
made
loops
for
my
hands
then
raising
myself
by
degrees
just
skimmed
above
the
ground
like
the
geese
when
finding
my
project
succeed
i
made
a
bold
push
got
upon
the
acropolis
and
from
thence
slid
down
to
the
theatre
having
got
so
far
without
danger
or
difficulty
i
began
to
meditate
greater
things
and
setting
off
from
parnethes
or
hymettus
flew
to
geranea
and
from
thence
to
the
top
of
the
tower
at
corinth
from
thence
over
pholoe
and
erymanthus
quite
to
taygetus
and
now
resolving
to
strike
a
bold
stroke
as
i
was
already
become
a
high
flyer
and
perfect
in
my
art
i
no
longer
confined
myself
to
chicken
flights
but
getting
upon
olympus
and
taking
a
little
light
provision
with
me
i
made
the
best
of
my
way
directly
towards
heaven
the
extreme
height
which
i
soared
to
brought
on
a
giddiness
at
first
but
this
soon
went
off
and
when
i
got
as
far
the
moon
having
left
a
number
of
clouds
behind
me
i
found
a
weariness
particularly
in
my
vulture
wing
i
halted
therefore
to
rest
myself
a
little
and
looking
down
from
thence
upon
the
earth
like
homer
jupiter
beheld
the
places
where
the
brave
mycians
prove
their
martial
force
and
hardy
thracians
tame
the
savage
horse
then
india
persia
and
greece
which
gave
me
wonderful
pleasure
and
satisfaction
friend
let
me
have
an
exact
account
of
all
your
travels
i
beseech
you
omit
not
the
least
particular
but
give
me
your
observations
upon
everything
i
expect
to
hear
a
great
deal
about
the
form
and
figure
of
the
earth
and
how
it
all
appeared
to
you
from
such
an
eminence
menippus
and
so
you
shall
ascend
therefore
in
imagination
with
me
to
the
moon
and
consider
the
situation
and
appearance
of
the
earth
from
thence
suppose
it
to
seem
as
it
did
to
me
much
less
than
the
moon
insomuch
that
when
i
first
looked
down
i
could
not
find
the
high
mountains
and
the
great
sea
and
if
it
had
not
been
for
the
rhodian
colossus
and
the
tower
of
pharos
should
not
have
known
where
the
earth
stood
at
length
however
by
the
reflection
of
the
sunbeams
the
ocean
appeared
and
showed
me
the
land
when
keeping
my
eyes
fixed
upon
it
i
beheld
clearly
and
distinctly
everything
that
was
doing
upon
earth
not
only
whole
nations
and
cities
but
all
the
inhabitants
of
them
whether
waging
war
cultivating
their
fields
trying
causes
or
anything
else
their
women
animals
everything
in
short
was
before
me
friend
most
improbable
all
this
and
contradictory
you
told
me
but
just
before
that
the
earth
was
so
little
by
its
great
distance
that
you
could
scarce
find
it
and
if
it
had
not
been
for
the
colossus
it
would
not
have
appeared
at
all
and
now
on
a
sudden
like
another
lynceus
you
can
spy
out
men
trees
animals
nay
i
suppose
even
a
flea
nest
if
you
chose
it
menippus
i
thank
you
for
putting
me
in
mind
of
what
i
had
forgot
to
mention
when
i
beheld
the
earth
but
could
not
distinguish
the
objects
upon
it
on
account
of
the
immense
distance
i
was
horribly
vexed
at
it
and
ready
to
cry
when
on
a
sudden
empedocles
the
philosopher
stood
behind
me
all
over
ashes
as
black
as
a
coal
and
dreadfully
scorched
when
i
saw
him
i
must
own
i
was
frightened
and
took
him
for
some
demon
of
the
moon
but
he
came
up
to
me
and
cried
out
menippus
do
be
afraid
i
am
no
god
why
thou
me
divine
i
am
empedocles
the
naturalist
after
i
had
leaped
into
the
furnace
a
vapour
from
aetna
carried
me
up
hither
and
here
i
live
in
the
moon
and
feed
upon
dew
i
am
come
to
free
you
from
your
present
distress
you
are
very
kind
said
i
most
noble
empedocles
and
when
i
fly
back
to
greece
i
shall
not
forget
to
pay
my
devotions
to
you
in
the
tunnel
of
my
chimney
every
new
moon
think
not
replied
he
that
i
do
this
for
the
sake
of
any
reward
i
might
expect
for
it
by
endymion
that
is
not
the
case
but
i
was
really
grieved
to
see
you
so
uneasy
and
now
how
shall
we
contrive
to
make
you
see
clear
that
by
jove
said
i
i
can
not
guess
unless
you
can
take
off
this
mist
from
my
eyes
for
they
are
horribly
dim
at
present
you
have
brought
the
remedy
along
with
you
how
so
have
you
not
got
an
eagle
wing
true
but
what
has
that
to
do
with
an
eye
an
eagle
you
know
is
more
than
any
other
creature
and
the
only
one
that
can
look
against
the
sun
your
true
royal
bird
is
known
by
never
winking
at
the
rays
be
they
ever
so
strong
so
i
have
heard
and
i
am
sorry
i
did
not
before
i
came
up
take
out
my
own
eyes
and
put
in
the
eagle
thus
imperfect
to
be
sure
i
am
not
royally
furnished
but
a
kind
of
bastard
bird
you
may
have
one
royal
eye
for
all
that
if
you
please
it
is
only
when
you
rise
up
to
fly
holding
the
vulture
wing
still
and
moving
the
eagle
only
by
which
means
you
will
see
clearly
with
one
though
not
at
all
with
the
other
that
will
do
and
is
sufficient
for
me
i
have
often
seen
smiths
and
other
artists
look
with
one
eye
only
to
make
their
work
the
truer
this
conversation
ended
empedocles
vanished
into
smoke
and
i
saw
no
more
of
him
i
acted
as
he
advised
me
and
no
sooner
moved
my
eagle
wing
than
a
great
light
came
all
around
me
and
i
saw
everything
as
clear
as
possible
looking
down
to
earth
i
beheld
distinctly
cities
and
men
and
everything
that
passed
amongst
them
not
only
what
they
did
openly
but
whatever
was
going
on
at
home
and
in
their
own
houses
where
they
thought
to
conceal
it
i
saw
lysimachus
betrayed
by
his
son
antiochus
intriguing
with
his
alexander
the
thessalian
slain
by
his
wife
and
attalus
poisoned
by
his
son
in
another
place
i
saw
arsaces
killing
his
wife
and
the
eunuch
arbaces
drawing
his
sword
upon
arsaces
spartim
the
mede
dragged
by
the
heels
from
the
banquet
by
his
guards
and
knocked
on
the
head
with
a
cup
in
the
palaces
of
scythia
and
thrace
the
same
wickedness
was
going
forward
and
nothing
could
i
see
but
murderers
adulterers
conspirators
false
swearers
men
in
perpetual
terrors
and
betrayed
by
their
dearest
friends
and
acquaintance
such
was
the
employment
of
kings
and
great
men
in
private
houses
there
was
something
more
ridiculous
there
i
saw
hermodorus
the
epicurean
forswearing
himself
for
a
thousand
drachmas
agathocles
the
stoic
quarrelling
with
his
disciples
about
the
salary
for
tuition
clinias
the
orator
stealing
a
phial
out
of
the
temple
not
to
mention
a
thousand
others
who
were
undermining
walls
litigating
in
the
forum
extorting
money
or
lending
it
upon
usury
a
sight
upon
the
whole
of
wonderful
variety
friend
it
must
have
been
very
entertaining
let
us
have
it
all
i
desire
menippus
i
had
much
ado
to
see
to
relate
it
to
you
is
impossible
it
was
like
homer
shield
on
one
side
were
feasting
and
nuptials
on
the
other
haranguing
and
decrees
here
a
sacrifice
and
there
a
burial
the
getae
at
war
the
scythians
travelling
in
their
caravans
the
egyptians
tilling
their
fields
the
phoenicians
merchandising
the
cilicians
robbing
and
plundering
the
spartans
flogging
their
children
and
the
athenians
perpetually
quarrelling
and
going
to
law
with
one
another
when
all
this
was
doing
at
the
same
time
you
may
conceive
what
a
strange
medley
this
appeared
to
me
it
was
just
as
if
a
number
of
dancers
or
rather
singers
were
met
together
and
every
one
was
ordered
to
leave
the
chorus
and
sing
his
own
song
each
striving
to
drown
the
other
voice
by
bawling
as
loud
as
he
could
you
may
imagine
what
kind
of
a
concert
this
would
make
friend
truly
ridiculous
and
confused
no
doubt
menippus
and
yet
such
my
friend
are
all
the
poor
performers
upon
earth
and
of
such
is
composed
the
discordant
music
of
human
life
the
voices
not
only
dissonant
and
inharmonious
but
the
forms
and
habits
all
differing
from
each
other
moving
in
various
directions
and
agreeing
in
nothing
till
at
length
the
great
master
of
the
choir
drives
everyone
of
them
from
the
stage
and
tells
him
he
is
no
longer
wanted
there
then
all
are
silent
and
no
longer
disturb
each
other
with
their
harsh
and
jarring
discord
but
in
this
wide
and
extensive
theatre
full
of
various
shapes
and
forms
everything
was
matter
of
laughter
and
ridicule
above
all
i
could
not
help
smiling
at
those
who
quarrel
about
the
boundaries
of
their
little
territory
and
fancy
themselves
great
because
they
occupy
a
sicyonian
field
or
possess
that
part
of
marathon
which
borders
on
oenoe
or
are
masters
of
a
thousand
acres
in
acharnae
when
after
all
to
me
who
looked
from
above
greece
was
but
four
fingers
in
breadth
and
attica
a
very
small
portion
of
it
indeed
i
could
not
but
think
how
little
these
rich
men
had
to
be
proud
of
he
who
was
lord
of
the
most
extensive
country
owned
a
spot
that
appeared
to
me
about
as
large
as
one
of
epicurus
atoms
when
i
looked
down
upon
peloponnesus
and
beheld
cynuria
i
reflected
with
astonishment
on
the
number
of
argives
and
lacedemonians
who
fell
in
one
day
fighting
for
a
piece
of
land
no
bigger
than
an
egyptian
lentil
and
when
i
saw
a
man
brooding
over
his
gold
and
boasting
that
he
had
got
four
cups
or
eight
rings
i
laughed
most
heartily
at
him
whilst
the
whole
pangaeus
with
all
its
mines
seemed
no
larger
than
a
grain
of
millet
friend
a
fine
sight
you
must
have
had
but
how
did
the
cities
and
the
men
look
menippus
you
have
often
seen
a
crowd
of
ants
running
to
and
fro
in
and
out
of
their
city
some
turning
up
a
bit
of
dung
others
dragging
a
shell
or
running
away
with
half
a
grain
of
wheat
i
make
no
doubt
but
they
have
architects
demagogues
senators
musicians
and
philosophers
amongst
them
men
my
friend
are
exactly
like
these
if
you
approve
not
of
the
comparison
recollect
if
you
please
the
ancient
thessalian
fables
and
you
will
find
that
the
myrmidons
a
most
warlike
nation
sprung
originally
from
pismires
when
i
had
thus
seen
and
diverted
myself
with
everything
i
shook
my
wings
and
flew
off
to
join
the
sacred
senate
of
the
skies
scarce
had
i
gone
a
furlong
when
the
moon
in
a
soft
female
voice
cried
out
to
me
menippus
will
you
carry
something
for
me
to
jupiter
so
may
your
journey
be
prosperous
with
all
my
heart
said
i
if
it
is
nothing
very
heavy
only
a
message
replied
she
a
small
petition
to
him
my
patience
is
absolutely
worn
out
by
the
philosophers
who
are
perpetually
disputing
about
me
who
i
am
of
what
size
how
it
happens
that
i
am
sometimes
round
and
full
at
others
cut
in
half
some
say
i
am
inhabited
others
that
i
am
only
a
hanging
over
the
sea
and
a
hundred
conjectures
of
this
kind
even
my
light
they
say
is
none
of
my
own
but
stolen
from
the
sun
thus
endeavouring
to
set
me
and
my
brother
together
by
the
ears
not
content
with
abusing
him
and
calling
him
a
hot
stone
and
a
mass
of
fire
in
the
meantime
i
am
no
stranger
to
what
these
men
who
look
so
grave
and
sour
all
day
are
doing
nights
but
i
see
and
say
nothing
not
thinking
it
decent
to
lay
open
their
vile
and
abominable
lives
to
the
public
for
when
i
catch
them
thieving
or
practising
any
of
their
nocturnal
tricks
i
wrap
myself
up
in
a
cloud
that
i
may
not
expose
to
the
world
a
parcel
of
old
fellows
who
in
spite
of
their
long
beards
and
professions
of
virtue
are
guilty
of
every
vice
and
yet
they
are
always
railing
at
and
abusing
me
i
swear
by
night
i
have
often
resolved
to
move
farther
off
to
get
out
of
reach
of
their
busy
tongues
and
i
beg
you
would
tell
jupiter
that
i
can
not
possibly
stay
here
any
longer
unless
he
will
destroy
these
naturalists
stop
the
mouths
of
the
logicians
throw
down
the
portico
burn
the
academy
and
make
an
end
of
the
inhabitants
of
peripatus
so
may
i
enjoy
at
last
a
little
rest
which
these
fellows
are
perpetually
disturbing
it
shall
be
done
said
i
and
away
i
set
out
for
heaven
where
no
tracks
of
beasts
or
signs
of
men
are
found
in
a
little
time
the
earth
was
invisible
and
the
moon
appeared
very
small
and
now
leaving
the
sun
on
my
right
hand
i
flew
amongst
the
stars
and
on
the
third
day
reached
my
journey
end
at
first
i
intended
to
fly
in
just
as
i
was
thinking
that
being
half
an
eagle
i
should
not
be
discovered
as
that
bird
was
an
old
acquaintance
of
jupiter
but
then
it
occurred
to
me
that
i
might
be
found
out
by
my
vulture
wing
and
laid
hold
on
deeming
it
therefore
most
prudent
not
to
run
the
hazard
i
went
up
and
knocked
at
the
door
mercury
heard
me
and
asking
my
name
went
off
immediately
and
carried
it
to
his
master
soon
after
i
was
let
in
and
trembling
and
quaking
with
fear
found
all
the
gods
sitting
together
and
seemingly
not
a
little
alarmed
at
my
appearance
there
expecting
probably
that
they
should
soon
have
a
number
of
winged
mortals
travelling
up
to
them
in
the
same
manner
when
jupiter
looking
at
me
with
a
most
severe
and
titanic
countenance
cried
out
say
who
thou
art
and
whence
thy
country
name
thy
parents
at
this
i
thought
i
should
have
died
with
fear
i
stood
motionless
and
astonished
at
the
awfulness
and
majesty
of
his
voice
but
recovering
myself
in
a
short
time
i
related
to
him
everything
from
the
beginning
how
desirous
i
was
of
knowing
sublime
truths
how
i
went
to
the
philosophers
and
hearing
them
contradict
one
another
and
driven
to
despair
thought
on
the
scheme
of
making
me
wings
with
all
that
had
happened
in
my
journey
quite
up
to
heaven
i
then
delivered
the
message
to
him
from
the
moon
at
which
softening
his
contracted
brow
he
smiled
at
me
and
cried
what
were
otus
and
ephialtes
in
comparison
of
menippus
who
has
thus
dared
to
fly
up
to
heaven
but
come
we
now
invite
you
to
supper
with
us
morrow
we
will
attend
to
your
business
and
dismiss
you
at
these
words
he
rose
up
and
went
to
that
part
of
heaven
where
everything
from
below
could
be
heard
most
distinctly
for
this
it
seems
was
the
time
appointed
to
hear
petitions
as
we
went
along
he
asked
me
several
questions
about
earthly
matters
such
as
how
much
corn
is
there
at
present
in
greece
had
you
a
hard
winter
last
year
and
did
your
cabbages
want
rain
is
any
of
phidias
family
alive
now
what
is
the
reason
that
the
athenians
have
left
off
sacrificing
to
me
for
so
many
years
do
they
think
of
building
up
the
olympian
temple
again
are
the
thieves
taken
that
robbed
the
dodonaean
when
i
had
answered
all
these
pray
menippus
said
he
what
does
mankind
really
think
of
me
how
should
they
think
of
you
said
i
but
with
the
utmost
veneration
that
you
are
the
great
sovereign
of
the
gods
there
you
jest
said
he
i
am
sure
i
know
well
enough
how
fond
they
are
of
novelty
though
you
will
not
own
it
there
was
a
time
indeed
when
i
was
held
in
some
estimation
when
i
was
the
great
physician
when
i
was
everything
in
short
when
streets
and
lanes
and
all
was
full
of
jove
pisa
and
dodona
were
distinguished
above
every
place
and
i
could
not
see
for
the
smoke
of
sacrifices
but
since
apollo
has
set
up
his
oracle
at
delphi
and
aesculapius
practises
physic
at
pergamus
since
temples
have
been
erected
to
bendis
at
thrace
to
anubis
in
egypt
and
to
diana
at
ephesus
everybody
runs
after
them
with
them
they
feast
to
them
they
offer
up
their
hecatombs
and
think
it
honour
enough
for
a
god
as
i
am
if
they
sacrifice
once
in
six
years
at
olympia
whilst
my
altars
are
as
cold
and
neglected
as
plato
laws
or
the
syllogisms
of
chrysippus
with
this
and
chat
we
passed
away
the
time
till
we
came
to
the
place
where
the
petitions
were
to
be
heard
here
we
found
several
holes
with
covers
to
them
and
close
to
every
one
was
placed
a
golden
chair
jupiter
sat
down
in
the
first
he
came
to
and
lifting
up
the
lid
listened
to
the
prayers
which
as
you
may
suppose
were
of
various
kinds
i
stooped
down
and
heard
several
of
them
myself
such
as
o
jupiter
grant
me
a
large
empire
o
jupiter
may
my
leeks
and
onions
flourish
and
increase
grant
jupiter
that
my
father
may
die
soon
grant
i
may
survive
my
wife
grant
i
may
not
be
discovered
whilst
i
lay
wait
for
my
brother
grant
that
i
may
get
my
cause
grant
that
i
may
be
crowned
at
olympia
one
sailor
asked
for
a
north
wind
another
for
a
south
the
husbandman
prayed
for
rain
and
the
fuller
for
sunshine
jupiter
heard
them
all
but
did
not
promise
everybody
some
the
just
request
he
heard
propitious
and
denied
the
rest
those
prayers
which
he
thought
right
and
proper
he
let
up
through
the
hole
and
blew
the
wicked
and
foolish
ones
back
that
they
might
not
rise
to
heaven
one
petition
indeed
puzzled
him
a
little
two
men
asking
favours
of
him
directly
contrary
to
each
other
at
the
same
time
and
promising
the
same
sacrifice
he
was
at
a
loss
which
to
oblige
he
became
immediately
a
perfect
academic
and
like
pyrrho
was
held
in
suspense
between
them
when
he
had
done
with
the
prayers
he
sat
down
upon
the
next
chair
over
another
hole
and
listened
to
those
who
were
swearing
and
making
vows
when
he
had
finished
this
business
and
destroyed
hermodorus
the
epicurean
for
perjury
he
removed
to
the
next
seat
and
gave
audience
to
the
auguries
oracles
and
divinations
which
having
despatched
he
proceeded
to
the
hole
that
brought
up
the
fume
of
the
victims
together
with
the
name
of
the
sacrificer
then
he
gave
out
his
orders
to
the
winds
and
storms
let
there
be
rain
in
scythia
lightning
in
africa
and
snow
in
greece
do
you
boreas
blow
in
lydia
and
whilst
notus
lies
still
let
the
north
wind
raise
the
waves
of
the
adriatic
and
about
a
thousand
measures
of
hail
be
sprinkled
over
cappadocia
when
jupiter
had
done
all
his
business
we
repaired
to
the
feast
for
it
was
now
and
mercury
bade
me
sit
down
by
pan
the
corybantes
attis
and
sabazius
a
kind
of
who
are
admitted
as
visitors
there
ceres
served
us
with
bread
and
bacchus
with
wine
hercules
handed
about
the
flesh
venus
scattered
myrtles
and
neptune
brought
us
fish
not
to
mention
that
i
got
slyly
a
little
nectar
and
ambrosia
for
my
friend
ganymede
out
of
nature
if
he
saw
jove
looking
another
way
would
frequently
throw
me
in
a
cup
or
two
the
greater
gods
as
homer
tells
us
who
i
suppose
had
seen
them
as
well
as
myself
never
taste
meat
or
wine
but
feed
upon
ambrosia
and
get
drunk
with
nectar
at
the
same
time
their
greatest
luxury
is
instead
of
victuals
to
suck
in
the
fumes
that
rise
from
the
victims
and
the
blood
of
the
sacrifices
that
are
offered
up
to
them
whilst
we
were
at
supper
apollo
played
on
the
harp
silenus
danced
a
cordax
and
the
muses
repeated
hesiod
theogony
and
the
first
ode
of
pindar
when
these
recreations
were
over
we
all
retired
tolerably
well
soaked
to
bed
now
pleasing
rest
had
sealed
each
mortal
eye
and
even
immortal
gods
in
slumber
lie
all
but
myself
i
could
not
help
thinking
of
a
thousand
things
and
particularly
how
it
came
to
pass
that
during
so
long
a
time
apollo
should
never
have
got
him
a
beard
and
how
there
came
to
be
night
in
heaven
though
the
sun
is
always
present
there
and
feasting
with
them
i
slept
a
little
and
early
in
the
morning
jupiter
ordered
the
crier
to
summon
a
council
of
the
gods
and
when
they
were
all
assembled
thus
addressed
himself
to
them
the
stranger
who
came
here
yesterday
is
the
chief
cause
of
my
convening
you
this
day
i
have
long
wanted
to
talk
with
you
concerning
the
philosophers
and
the
complaints
now
sent
to
us
from
the
moon
make
it
immediately
necessary
to
take
the
affair
into
consideration
there
is
lately
sprung
up
a
race
of
men
slothful
quarrelsome
foolish
petulant
gluttonous
proud
abusive
in
short
what
homer
calls
an
idle
burthen
to
the
ground
these
dividing
themselves
into
sects
run
through
all
the
labyrinths
of
disputation
calling
themselves
stoics
academics
epicureans
peripatetics
and
a
hundred
other
names
still
more
ridiculous
then
wrapping
themselves
up
in
the
sacred
veil
of
virtue
they
contract
their
brows
and
let
down
their
beards
under
a
specious
appearance
hiding
the
most
abandoned
profligacy
like
one
of
the
players
on
the
stage
if
you
strip
him
of
his
fine
habits
wrought
with
gold
all
that
remains
behind
is
a
ridiculous
spectacle
of
a
little
contemptible
fellow
hired
to
appear
there
for
seven
drachmas
and
yet
these
men
despise
everybody
talk
absurdly
of
the
gods
and
drawing
in
a
number
of
credulous
boys
roar
to
them
in
a
tragical
style
about
virtue
and
enter
into
disputations
that
are
endless
and
unprofitable
to
their
disciples
they
cry
up
fortitude
and
temperance
a
contempt
of
riches
and
pleasures
and
when
alone
indulge
in
riot
and
debauchery
the
most
intolerable
of
all
is
that
though
they
contribute
nothing
towards
the
good
and
welfare
of
the
community
though
they
are
unknown
alike
in
council
and
in
field
yet
are
they
perpetually
finding
fault
with
abusing
and
reviling
others
and
he
is
counted
the
greatest
amongst
them
who
is
most
impudent
noisy
and
malevolent
if
one
should
say
to
one
of
these
fellows
who
speak
ill
of
everybody
service
are
you
of
to
the
commonwealth
he
would
reply
if
he
spoke
fairly
and
honestly
be
a
sailor
or
a
soldier
or
a
husbandman
or
a
mechanic
i
think
beneath
me
but
i
can
make
a
noise
and
look
dirty
wash
myself
in
cold
water
go
barefoot
all
winter
and
then
like
momus
find
fault
with
everybody
else
if
any
rich
man
sups
luxuriously
i
rail
at
and
abuse
him
but
if
any
of
my
friends
or
acquaintance
fall
sick
and
want
my
assistance
i
take
no
notice
of
them
such
my
brother
gods
are
the
cattle
which
i
complain
of
and
of
all
these
the
epicureans
are
the
worst
who
assert
that
the
gods
take
no
care
of
human
affairs
or
look
at
all
into
them
it
is
high
time
my
brethren
that
we
should
take
this
matter
into
consideration
for
if
once
they
can
persuade
the
people
to
believe
these
things
you
must
all
starve
for
who
will
sacrifice
to
you
when
they
can
get
nothing
by
it
what
the
moon
accuses
you
of
you
all
heard
yesterday
from
the
stranger
consult
therefore
amongst
yourselves
and
determine
what
may
best
promote
the
happiness
of
mankind
and
our
own
security
when
jupiter
had
thus
spoken
the
assembly
rung
with
repeated
cries
of
thunder
and
lightning
burn
consume
destroy
down
with
them
into
the
pit
to
tartarus
and
the
giants
jove
however
once
more
commanding
silence
cried
out
it
shall
be
done
as
you
desire
they
and
their
philosophy
shall
perish
together
but
at
present
no
punishments
must
be
inflicted
for
these
four
months
to
come
as
you
all
know
it
is
a
solemn
feast
and
i
have
declared
a
truce
next
year
in
the
beginning
of
the
spring
my
lightning
shall
destroy
them
as
to
menippus
first
cutting
off
his
wings
that
he
may
not
come
here
again
let
mercury
carry
him
down
to
the
earth
saying
this
he
broke
up
the
assembly
and
mercury
taking
me
up
by
my
right
ear
brought
me
down
and
left
me
yesterday
evening
in
the
ceramicus
and
now
my
friend
you
have
heard
everything
i
had
to
tell
you
from
heaven
i
must
take
my
leave
and
carry
this
good
news
to
the
philosophers
who
are
walking
in
the
poecile
notes
one
of
alexander
generals
to
whose
share
on
the
division
of
the
empire
after
that
monarch
death
fell
the
kingdom
of
thrace
in
which
was
situated
the
city
of
abdera
a
small
fragment
of
this
tragedy
which
has
in
it
the
very
line
here
quoted
by
lucian
is
yet
extant
in
barnes
edition
of
euripides
this
story
may
afford
no
useless
admonition
to
the
managers
of
the
haymarket
and
other
summer
theatres
who
it
is
to
be
hoped
will
not
run
the
hazard
of
inflaming
their
audiences
with
too
much
tragedy
in
the
dog
days
this
alludes
to
the
parthian
war
in
the
time
of
severian
the
particulars
of
which
except
the
few
here
occasionally
glanced
at
we
are
strangers
to
lucian
most
probably
by
this
tract
totally
knocked
up
some
of
the
historians
who
had
given
an
account
of
it
and
prevented
many
others
who
were
intimidated
by
the
severity
of
his
strictures
attempting
to
transmit
the
history
of
it
to
posterity
this
saying
is
attributed
to
empedocles
the
most
famous
of
the
pontic
cities
and
well
known
as
the
residence
of
the
renowned
cynic
philosopher

is
still
called
by
the

name

and
humour
something
of
this
kind
appeared
in
a
newspaper
a
few
years
ago
which
i
think
was
called
news
for
a
hundred
years
hence
and
though
but
a
rough
sketch
was
well
executed
a
larger
work
on
the
same
ground
and
by
a
good
hand
might
afford
much
entertainment
this
kind
of
scholastic
jargon
was
much
in
vogue
in
the
time
of
lucian
and
it
is
no
wonder
he
should
take
every
opportunity
of
laughing
at
it
as
nothing
can
be
more
opposite
to
true
genius
wit
and
humour
than
such
pedantry
milo
the
crotonian
wrestler
is
reported
to
have
been
a
man
of
most
wonderful
bodily
strength
concerning
which
a
number
of
lies
are
told
for
which
the
reader
if
he
pleases
may
consult
his
dictionary
he
lost
his
life
we
are
informed
by
trying
to
rend
with
his
hands
an
old
oak
which
wedged
him
in
and
pressed
him
to
death
the
poet
says
he
met
his
end
wedged
in
that
timber
which
he
strove
to
rend
titornus
was
a
rival
of
milo
and
according
to
aelian
who
is
not
always
to
be
credited
rolled
a
large
stone
with
ease
which
milo
with
all
his
force
could
not
stir
conon
was
some
slim
macaroni
of
that
age
remarkable
only
for
his
debility

was

of

by
aristophanes

his
comedy

we
may
suppose
renowned
in
their
time
for
teaching
the
young

diodorus

concerning
some
of
these

as
they
were

with

divided

the
story

way

might
our
author
therefore
find
fault
with
their
uncertainty

this
fine
picture
of
a
good
historian
has
been
copied
by

it
is
a
standard
of
perfection
however
which
few
writers
ancient
or
modern
have
been
able
to
reach
thuanus
has
prefixed
to
his
history
these
lines
of
lucian
but
whether
he
or
any
other
historian
hath
answered
in
every
point
to
the
description
here
given
is
i
believe
yet
undetermined
the
saying
is
attributed
to
aristophanes
though
i
can
not
find
it
there
it
is
observable
that
this
proverbial
kind
of
expression
for
freedom
of
words
and
sentiments
has
been
adopted
into
almost
every
language
though
the
image
conveying
it
is
different
thus
the
greeks
call
a
fig
a
fig
etc
we
say
an
honest
man
calls
a
spade
a
spade

history
is
comprehended
in
nine
books
to
each
of
which
is
prefixed
the
name
of
a
muse
the
first
is
called
clio
the
second
euterpe
and
so
on
a
modern
poet
i
have
been
told
the
ingenious
aaron
hill
improved
upon
this
thought
and
christened
if
we
may
properly
so
call
it
not
his
books
but
his
daughters
by
the
same
poetical
names
of
miss
cli
miss
miss
miss
urania
etc
both
thucydides
and
livy
are
reprehensible
in
this
particular
and
the
same
objection
may
be
made
to
thuanus
clarendon
burnet
and
many
other
modern
historians
how
just
is
this
observation
of
lucian
and
at
the
same
time
how
truly
poetical
is
the
image
which
he
makes
use
of
to
express
it
it
puts
us
in
mind
of
his
rival
critic
longinus
who
as
pope
has
observed
is
himself
the
great
sublime
he
draws
by
this
very
just
observation
lucian
means
to
censure
all
those
writers
and
we
have
many
such
now
amongst
us
who
take
so
much
pains
to
smooth
and
round
their
periods
as
to
disgust
their
readers
by
the
frequent
repetition
of
it
as
it
naturally
produces
a
tiresome
sameness
in
the
sound
of
them
and
at
the
same
time
discovers
too
much
that
laborious
art
and
care
which
it
is
always
the
author
business
as
much
as
possible
to
conceal
see
homer
iliad
bk
the
famous
lacedaemonian
general
the
circumstance
alluded
to
is
in
thucydides
bk
iv
gr
greek
a
technical
term
borrowed
from
music
and
signifying
that
tone
of
the
voice
which
exactly
corresponds
with
the
instrument
accompanying
it
a
coarse
fish
that
came
from
pontus
or
the
black
saperdas
advehe
ponto
see
pers
sat
here
doctors
differ
several
of
thucydides
descriptions
are
certainly
very
long
many
of
them
perhaps
rather
tedious
lucian
is
rather
severe
on
this
writer
cicero
only
says
de
omnibus
omnia
libere
palam
dixit
he
spoke
freely
of
everybody
other
writers
however
are
of
the
same
opinion
with
our
satirist
with
regard
to
him
see
dions
plutarch
cornelius
nepos
etc
alluding
to
the
story
of
diogenes
as
related
in
the
beginning
see
homer
odyssey
the
strange
stories
which
lucian
here
mentions
may
certainly
be
numbered
with
all
due
deference
to
so
great
a
name
amongst
the
nugae
canorae
of
old
homer
juvenal
certainly
considers
them
in
this
light
when
he
says
tam
vacui
capitis
populum
phaeaca
putavit
some
modern
critics
however
have
endeavoured
to
defend
them
here
the
history
begins
what
goes
before
may
be
considered
as
the
author
preface
and
should
have
been
marked
as
such
in
the
original
among
the
greek
wines
so
much
admired
by
ancient
epicures
those
of
the
islands
of
the
archipelago
were
the
most
celebrated
and
of
these
the
chian
wine
the
product
of
chios
bore
away
the
palm
from
every
other
and
particularly
that
which
was
made
from
vines
growing
on
the
mountain
called
arevisia
in
testimony
of
which
it
were
easy
if
necessary
to
produce
an
amphora
full
of
classical
quotations
the
present
inhabitants
of
that
island
make
a
small
quantity
of
excellent
wine
for
their
own
use
and
are
liberal
of
it
to
strangers
who
travel
that
way
but
dare
not
being
under
turkish
government
cultivate
the
vines
well
or
export
the
product
of
them
in
the
same
manner
as
gulliver
island
of
from
this
passage
it
is
not
improbable
but
that
swift
borrowed
the
idea
the
account
which
lucian
here
gives
us
of
his
visit
to
the
moon
perhaps
suggested
to
bergerac
the
idea
of
his
ingenious
work
called
a
voyage

lucian
we
see
has
founded
his
history
on
matter
of
fact
endymion
we
all
know
was
a
king
of
elis
though
some
call
him
a
shepherd
shepherd
or
king
however
he
was
so
handsome
that
the
moon
who
saw
him
sleeping
on
mount
latmos
fell
in
love
with
him
this
no
orthodox
heathen
ever
doubted
lucian
who
was
a
freethinker
laughs
indeed
at
the
tale
but
has
made
him
ample
amends
in
this
history
by
creating
him
emperor
of
the
moon
modern
astronomers
are
i
think
agreed
that
we
are
to
the
moon
just
the
same
as
the
moon
is
to
us
though
lucian
history
may
be
false
therefore
his
philosophy
we
see
was
true
the
moon
is
not
habitable
this
i
am
afraid
is
not
so
agreeable
to
the
modern
system
our
philosophers
all
asserting
that
the
sun
is
not
habitable
as
it
is
a
place
however
which
we
are
very
little
acquainted
with
they
may
be
mistaken
and
lucian
may
guess
as
well
as
ourselves
for
aught
we
can
prove
to
the
contrary

called

of

of

therefore
she
was
naturally
the
presiding

according
to

fell
in
love
with
the
famous
river
enipeus
and
was
always
wandering
on
its
banks
where
neptune
found
her
covered
her
with
his
waves
and
throwing
her
into
a
deep
sleep
supplied
the
place
of
enipeus
lucian
has
made
her
amends
by
bestowing
one
of
his
imaginary
kingdoms
upon
her
his
part
of
the
story
however
is
full
as
probable
as
the
rest
suberipedes
this
description
of
the
pagan
elysium
or
island
of
the
blessed
is
well
drawn
and
abounds
in
fanciful
and
picturesque
imagery
interspersed
with
strokes
of
humour
and
satire
the
second
book
is
indeed
throughout
more
entertaining
and
better
written
than
the
first
see
the
ajax
flagellifer
of
sophocles
lucian
humorously
degrades
him
from
the
character
of
a
hero
and
gives
him
hellebore
as
a
madman
it
is
not
improbable
but
that
voltaire
el
dorado
in
his
candide
might
have
been
suggested
to
him
by
this
passage
their
appearance
is
exactly
like
that
of
shadows
made
by
the
sun
at
noonday
with
this
only
difference
that
one
lies
flat
on
the
ground
the
other
is
erect
and
one
is
dark
the
other
light
or
diaphanous
our
vulgar
idea
of
ghosts
especially
with
regard
to
their
not
being
tangible
corresponds
with
this
of
lucian
a
famous
musician
clemens
alexandrinus
gives
us
a
full
account
of
him
to
whom
i
refer
the
curious
reader
this
poet
we
are
told
wrote
some
severe
verses
on
helen
for
which
he
was
punished
by
castor
and
pollux
with
loss
of
sight
but
on
making
his
recantation
in
a
palinodia
his
eyes
were
graciously
restored
to
him
lucian
has
affronted
her
still
more
grossly
by
making
her
run
away
with
cinyrus
but
he
we
are
to
suppose
being
not
over
superstitious
defied
the
power
of
castor
and
pollux
nothing
appears
more
ridiculous
to
a
modern
reader
than
the
perpetual
encomiums
on
the
musical
merit
of
swans
and
swallows
which
we
meet
with
in
all
the
writers
of
antiquity
a
proper
account
and
explanation
of
this
is
i
think
amongst
the
desiderata
of
literature
there
is
an
entertaining
tract
on
this
subject
in
the
hist
de
tom
by
morin
who
ravished
cassandra
the
daughter
of
priam
and
priestess
of
minerva
who
sent

sunk

second

of

one
of
the
seven
sages
but
excepted
against
by

because
he
was
king
of
corinth
and
a
tyrant
see
his
treatise
de
republica
his
quitting
elysium
to
live
in
his
own
republic
is
a
stroke
of
true
humour
alluding
to
a
passage
in
hesiod
already
quoted
lucian
laughs
at
the
sceptics
though
he
was

of
them

him
