extras

enormous

but
they
contained
no
more

was
brought
to
a
standstill
and
stocks
fell
in
half
an
hour
from
five
to
twenty
per
cent
the
land
was
convulsed
it
was
true
that
there
were
those
who
thought
the
whole
thing
a
colossal
hoax
perpetrated
by
the
defeated
party
but
as
time
went
on
the
startling
and
incredible
news
was
confirmed

ominous

the
card

an
eminent
politician
found
in
the
vestibule
of
the
executive
mansion
is
a
dark
political

the
situation
unchanged
rumors
of
every
description
ran
wild
telegrams
of
condolence
from
all
the
sovereigns

world
were
received
at

by
the
dazed
department
of
state
these
were
fully
given
to
the
omnivorous
press
by
order
of
the
all

for
the
present
rigorously
withheld
from

to
this
censorship
the
press
submitted
cordially

was
brooding
over
the
land
and
despair
laughed
detectives
in
the
face
men
met
each
other
and
asked
only
this
question
have
they
been
found
a
sad
shake
of
the
head
always
followed
no
wonder
the
governor
of
massachusetts
was
heard
to
say
with
thousands
of
assassins
coming
over
here
every
year
even
our
president
was
not
safe
god
help
our
country
at
the
end
of
a
few
days
the
full
news
as
far
as
it
went
was
published
and
the
nation
then
drew
its
second
breath
the
facts
about
this
stupendous
abduction
as
given
to
the
public
by
the
end
of
the
week
were
briefly
these
this
is
the
affidavit
of
the
night
sentry
who
was
stationed
in
the
vestibule
of
the
white
house
my
name
is
george
henry
i
am
years
old
i
was
born
in
this
country
my
father
was
a
slave
it
was
about
last
night
when
i
was
aroused
by
a
double
rap
at
the
main
entrance
i
was
not
asleep
but
i
may
have
been
a
little
sleepy
i
asked
who
was
there
and
a
voice
answered
that
the
secretary
of
state
wished
to
see
the
president
on
business
of
the
greatest
importance
i
answered
that
the
president
was
in
bed
he
said
that
he
must
see
the
president
immediately
then
i
thought
i
recognized
the
voice
of
secretary
i
opened
the
door
and
sure
enough
secretary
entered
he
had
on
a
silk
hat
and
the
gray
overcoat
he
usually
wears
he
gave
me
his
card
and
told
me
to
take
it
right
up
to
the
president
the
door
was
left
open
and
i
noticed
it
was
raining
the
carriage
of
the
secretary
was
standing
under
the
portico
i
did
not
see
the
coachman
when
i
bowed
and
turned
to
go
upstairs
there
was
a
strange
smell
in
the
air
and
i
remember
nothing
more
the
brought
out
from
the
prisoner
who
seemed
to
answer
honestly
and
intelligently
that
he
was
sure
it
was
the
secretary
of
state
but
his
voice
seemed
changed
by
a
cold
he
felt
positive
about
the
carriage
for
he
recognized
the
team
a
gray
and
a
black
he
heard
no
voices
outside
when
chloroform
was
produced
he
said
that
was
the
same
smell
but
there
was
something
more
that
was
considerably
tarter
he
persisted
in
the
same
story
and
repeated
it
over
and
over
without
variation
it
looked
dubious
for
his
excellency
the
secretary
of
state
the
next
witness
was
the
night
sentry
on
the
second
floor
he
was
badly
frightened
was
a
little
confused
but
told
a
straight
story
his
deposition
was
as
follows
yes
sah
my
name
is
frank
steven
i
have
alluz
been
a
colored
man
i
was
bahn
in
ohio
when
i
was
twelve
years
old
at
this
juncture
a
glass
of
ice
water
restored
the
equilibrium
of
the
witness
i
moved
to
ohio
when
i
was
twelve
years
old
i
was
born
in
mississipy
i
now
i
think
it
might
have
been
half
after
one
or
two
when
i
heard
a
step
up
the
stairs
i
went
to
the
landing
and
saw
secretary
of
state
up
with
his
hat
on
and
how
he
got
there
the
lawd
only
knows
he
told
me
to
show
him
to
president
room
he
spoke
mighty
sharp
and
i
thought
it
was
all
right
so
i
led
the
way
when
i
was
to
knock
at
president
door
he
told
me
to
stop
and
have
a
cigar
first
he
never
offered
me
one
before
and
i
was
mighty
surprised
there
was
a
strange
smell
like
an
apothecary
store
and
i
do
know
anything
more
about
it
that
is
all
i
know
sir
subsequent
examination
brought
out
no
new
fact
except
that
the
prisoner
remembered
that
the
secretary
coughed
behind
a
handkerchief
as
he
spoke
and
that
one
hand
was
concealed
under
his
gray
overcoat
this
was
pulled
over
his
ears
the
thing
that
struck
him
most
was
that
the
secretary
kept
his
hat
on
during
the
whole
interview
the
watchman
had
never
known
him
to
keep
his
hat
on
in
the
house
before
like
the
first
witness
he
recognized
the
odor
of
chloroform
and
thought
there
was
something
else
besides
he
was
surprised
to
find
himself
gagged
and
bound
when
he
came
to
as
the
two
witnesses
corroborated
each
other
and
as
neither
had
any
communication
with
the
other
they
were
substantially
believed
the
fact
that
this
testimony
was
indisputably
damaging
to
the
secretary
of
state
and
the
further
circumstantial
evidence
of
his
card
having
been
recovered
from
the
floor
of
the
lower
vestibule
caused
the
investigating
committee
of
which
inspector
byrnes
was
the
chairman
rigorously
to
exclude
all
reporters
lest
the
evidence
might
make
it
to
say
the
least
uncomfortable
for
the
suspected
dignitary
it
was
natural
that
by
ten
on
the
morning
of
the
drama
a
secret
guard
should
be
placed
over
the
head
of
the
department
of
state
though
no
movement
was
made
as
yet
toward
his
arrest
the
next
witness
of
importance
was
the
president
valet
who
swore
that
the
president
retired
unusually
early
that
night
and
dismissed
him
with
the
special
injunction
that
the
house
should
be
kept
quiet
as
the
president
had
a
headache
and
wished
perfect
rest
it
may
be
well
to
state
here
that
the
new
incumbent
of
the
presidential
chair
shared
with
his
wife
the
traditions
of
jeffersonian
simplicity
of
living
and
that
they
departed
so
little
from
their
original
home
habits
that
house
detectives
were
abolished
and
the
distinguished
pair
lived
entertained
and
slept
with
as
scant
formality
as
the
sovereign
people
allowed
the
doors
communicating
with
their
sleeping
apartments
were
rarely
locked
full
dependence
for
safety
was
placed
upon
the
two
trusted
watchmen
whose
deposition
has
been
given
the
children
and
their
attendants
who
slept
in
adjacent
rooms
heard
no
noise
during
the
night
in
short
none
but
the
two
under
strict
arrest
were
aware
of
the
entrance
of
any
person
or
persons
after
twelve
in
the
meanwhile
detectives
were
stationed
unostentatiously
throughout
the
white
house
watching
with
professional
acuteness
the
movements
of
everyone
within
its
doors
at
eleven
precisely
on
the
morning
of
the
ninth
of
june
inspector
byrnes
and
the
chief
of
the
washington
police
drove
up
in
a
hack
to
the
door
of
the
secretary
mansion
and
requested
a
private
interview
within
was
feverish
commotion
senators
and
representatives
public
officials
and
men
of
eminence
were
sending
in
their
cards
and
excitedly
discussing
the
dreadful
news
telegrams
were
beginning
to
pour
in
the
first
impression
was
confirmed
that
a
political
coup
or
revenge
was
at
the
bottom
of
the
shocking
affair
and
whispers
were
mysteriously
exchanged
between
sombre
and
stately
heads
when
the
secretary
saw
the
cards
he
immediately
withdrew
with
an
aside
to
the
secretary
of
war
this
visit
may
clear
up
some
of
the
mystery
these
words
were
not
calculated
to
soothe
the
impatience
of
the
inner
circle
when
the
three
were
alone
in
the
private
office
the
chief
of
the
washington
police
force
tersely
opened
the
subject
he
was
a
blunt
official
of
adamantine
integrity
a
veteran
of
the
war
secretary
he
began
this
is
the
saddest
day
the
country
has
known
for
many
a
year
you
must
pardon
me
if
i
ask
you
a
few
leading
questions
inspector
byrnes
sat
with
his
back
to
the
light
for
with
an
inimitable
fashion
of
his
own
he
had
upon
entering
made
a
debouch
between
two
chairs
and
a
table
forcing
the
secretary
to
sit
with
his
face
to
the
glare
of
the
window
shaded
himself
he
could
with
impunity
watch
the
least
expression
on
the
sensitive
and
noble
countenance
before
him
sir
do
you
recognize
this
card
the
question
came
like
a
musket
shot
and
a
card
dropped
face
upwards
on
the
secretary
knee
kellar
could
not
have
performed
this
feat
more
neatly
the
secretary
glanced
at
the
pasteboard
for
a
moment
and
said
in
evident
surprise
why
yes
it
is
one
of
my
cards
have
you
any
more
with
you
asked
inspector
byrnes
speaking
for
the
first
time
the
secretary
seemed
puzzled
but
opened
his
wallet
and
produced
several
of
the
same
description
these
he
handed
to
the
inspector
who
took
them
and
bowed
profoundly
a
moment
was
spent
in
intense
examination
you
must
pardon
me
if
i
ask
you
if
you
use
these
cards
when
calling
upon
the
president
proceeded
the
washington
officer
the
eyes
seemed
to
be
still
riveted
upon
the
cards
in
his
hands
why
yes
no
that
is
once
in
a
while
if
i
happen
to
desire
an
audience
at
an
unusual
hour
answered
the
secretary
exhibiting
the
first
signs
of
embarrassment
will
you
please
tell
us
when
you
called
there
last
asked
inspector
byrnes
furtively
glancing
up
and
speaking
in
a
chatty
assuring
tone
the
secretary
face
expressed
relief
certainly
he
answered
that
is
easy
enough
i
attended
an
informal
reception
in
the
blue
room
from
three
to
four
yesterday
and
saw
the
president
alone
a
minute
afterward
that
is
the
last
time
i
saw
him
one
might
almost
have
fancied
at
the
last
sentence
that
tears
arose
to
the
eyes
of
the
cabinet
officer
at
least
there
were
tears
in
his
voice
just
as
a
matter
of
formality
secretary
will
you
tell
us
where
you
were
between
twelve
and
two
this
morning
asked
the
inspector
with
the
unconscious
look
of
a
man
who
was
asking
for
a
glass
of
water
what
does
this
mean
sir
do
you
suspect
me
in
this
infernal
mystery
ejaculated
the
secretary
his
face
was
pale
from
excitement
his
eyes
flashed
in
manly
protest
not
at
all
not
at
all
sir
calm
yourself
this
is
only
a
matter
of
curious
coincidence
and
a
disagreeable
formality
answered
the
inspector
waving
his
hand
as
if
he
were
brushing
away
a
fly
the
secretary
stood
a
moment
in
thought
and
then
turned
and
touched
a
button
immediately
a
servant
appeared
to
whom
the
secretary
whispered
a
few
words
the
man
in
livery
bowed
and
went
now
gentlemen
said
the
secretary
standing
with
much
dignity
before
his
callers
wait
a
moment
and
so
far
as
i
am
concerned
this
mystery
shall
be
cleared
i
happened
to
be
in
this
room
last
night
from
twelve
until
two
with
some
gentlemen
whom
i
am
sure
you
will
recognize
ah
here
they
are
a
tap
at
the
door
and
a
come
in
revealed
to
the
astonished
detectives
the
secretaries
of
war
and
of
the
interior
who
entered
the
room
now
inspector
continued
the
secretary
of
state
in
his
grandest
manner
will
you
kindly
ask
your
question
again
it
then
transpired
that
the
three
secretaries
had
conducted
an
informal
meeting
to
confer
about
the
distressing
question
of
war
with
canada
which
was
at
that
time
agitating
the
country
and
that
their
interview
had
been
prolonged
into
the
small
hours
of
the
morning
the
chief
of
the
washington
police
could
not
refrain
from
profuse
apologies
after
this
denouement
inspector
byrnes
thought
profoundly
and
then
after
a
pause
burst
out
with
unparalleled
frankness
gentlemen
this
is
the
most
startling
mystery
in
the
annals
of
american
crime
i
must
confess
that
up
to
this
moment
i
am
absolutely
foiled
he
then
recounted
under
seal
of
secrecy
the
whole
story
as
we
have
seen
it
ending
his
exciting
narrative
he
said
and
secretary
do
you
know
of
any
one
in
washington
or
in
the
country
that
resembles
you
enough
to
deceive
two
men
taking
into
account
a
natural
drowsiness
that
each
admitted
the
three
gentlemen
of
the
cabinet
thought
hard
but
were
soon
bound
to
answer
in
the
negative
for
the
secretary
of
state
was
no
man
conspicuous
on
any
occasion
though
not
what
might
be
strictly
called
handsome
he
always
commanded
attention
by
his
distinguished
air
his
luxuriant
side
whiskers
which
were
really
magnificent
were
the
most
noticeable
feature
of
his
face
he
had
the
happy
consciousness
that
there
were
none
like
them
in
the
united
states
there
is
only
one
more
question
you
can
answer
secretary
said
inspector
byrnes
with
a
deferential
look
the
watchman
on
the
first
floor
said
he
recognized
your
team
will
you
please
find
out
whether
your
coupé
was
in
or
not
between
twelve
and
two
coachmen
have
queer
tricks
at
times
the
coachman
was
immediately
sent
for
meanwhile
the
secretary
stated
that
he
had
come
in
at
twelve
from
a
late
call
on
a
personal
friend
may
i
ask
your
friend
name
interrupted
the
national
swiftly
and
politely
the
patagonian
ambassador
replied
the
secretary
with
hauteur
he
added
that
he
had
sent
his
carriage
instructing
john
the
family
coachman
to
be
on
hand
at
eleven
that
morning
the
carriage
was
evidently
not
there
and
in
the
excitement
of
the
news
the
secretary
had
foregone
his
morning
department
business
after
half
an
hour
of
waiting
during
which
the
two
police
officers
had
sent
out
several
messages
the
coachman
was
ushered
in
among
the
impatient
quintet
instead
of
the
prim
and
stately
master
of
the
horse
who
was
the
despair
of
even
his
the
jehu
of
the
english
ambassador
and
the
admiration
of
the
washington
gamin
there
skulked
in
a
battered
bandaged
man
who
shuffled
out
incoherent
excuses
and
burst
into
moist
apologies
it
was
my
fault
the
divil
was
in
it
the
hosses
are
safe
the
kerridge
is
well
i
woke
up
in
the
gutter
the
blood
sputterin
down
me
backbone
they
were
picked
up
this
morning
do
discharge
me
served
you
fifteen
years
and
only
trained
twicst
what
become
of
me
lord
have
mercy
the
coachman
of
the
secretary
had
a
stock
of
irreproachable
syntax
which
had
been
utterly
scattered
during
the
experience
of
the
last
night
at
this
spontaneous
moment
his
native
grammar
got
the
best
of
him
the
coachman
testimony
amounted
to
this
the
driver
was
walking
his
horses
to
the
stable
in
the
fog
when
he
saw
a
man
beckon
him
from
the
sidewalk
not
a
soul
was
on
the
street
beyond
was
a
dark
private
lane
he
stopped
and
to
his
surprise
saw
as
he
thought
his
master
standing
and
motioning
him
to
come
to
a
halt
and
get
down
the
secretary
face
was
turned
toward
the
dark
the
voice
sounded
muffled
when
the
coachman
alighted
his
master
produced
a
silver
flask
and
told
him
to
take
a
drink
as
it
was
so
damp
he
dared
not
disobey
though
full
of
wonder
at
this
unprecedented
favor
as
soon
as
he
had
taken
a
pull
he
felt
dizzy
two
or
three
more
black
figures
appeared
like
ghosts
before
his
eyes
he
thought
he
struck
out
or
tried
to
run
to
the
coach
he
did
know
which
a
queer
odor
mounted
to
his
head
then
he
lost
consciousness
he
came
to
early
in
the
morning
a
little
after
four
and
staggered
to
the
stable
the
team
was
not
there
he
fell
into
a
stupor
of
despair
about
an
hour
after
an
acquaintance
of
his
drove
the
span
up
and
said
they
had
been
found
unchecked
grazing
near
the
smithsonian
institute
he
supposed
that
they
had
run
away
the
secretary
coachman
had
then
given
the
fellow
five
dollars
for
his
services
and
to
hold
his
tongue
he
was
afraid
of
being
discharged
he
had
just
heard
of
the
disappearance
of
the
president
and
he
feared
being
implicated
in
the
affair
after
the
name
of
the
person
who
found
the
horses
was
taken
down
and
after
a
searching
the
frightened
man
was
sent
away
to
rest
with
assurance
of
continued
favor
subsequent
examinations
failed
to
find
any
traces
of
the
catastrophe
in
the
coupé
it
had
been
carefully
cleaned
when
it
came
back
to
the
stable
there
was
no
blood
visible
this
completes
the
whole
of
the
testimony
and
information
that
was
received
or
discovered
by
the
united
efforts
of
all
the
detectives
in
america
up
to
the
fourteenth
of
the
month
clews
had
been
manufactured
and
followed
with
desperate
rapidity
but
to
no
avail
numberless
arrests
had
been
made
but
no
one
could
be
legally
held
for
high
treason
against
the
chief
executive
all
that
was
known
was
this
that
some
bold
villain
had
successfully
personated
the
secretary
of
state
that
he
had
gulled
three
servants
by
a
close
resemblance
that
he
with
others
probably
had
forcibly
carried
the
president
and
his
wife
from
their
very
beds
leaving
them
but
scant
time
to
take
the
necessary
articles
of
clothing
that
these
abductors
had
audaciously
used
the
state
carriage
for
their
nefarious
purpose
that
they
had
left
absolutely
no
trace
behind
and
that
moreover
in
the
darkness
of
the
fog
and
rain
no
further
track
could
be
found
of
the
direction
they
took
they
could
not
have
gone
by
train
so
every
house
in
the
city
of
washington
and
in
the
suburbs
to
the
distance
of
fifteen
miles
or
more
had
been
searched
in
vain
a
like
systematic
investigation
was
carried
on
along
the
river
to
the
bay
in
search
of
anything
suspicious
afloat
the
authorities
gave
the
robbers
of
the
nation
no
time
or
opportunity
to
escape
by
land
or
water
all
avenues
were
watched
where
were
they
and
their
noble
booty
in
short
the
foremost
couple
of
the
united
states
had
utterly
disappeared
to
the
horror
and
despair
of
the
civilized
world
it
was
just
one
week
from
the
morning
of
the
shock
when
the
new
york
published
the
following
manifesto
in
its
original
form
it
was
sent
as
an
advertisement
with
five
dollars
enclosed
the
envelope
was
postmarked
from
division
ii
of
the
new
york
the
document
bore
no
superscription
it
read
as
follows
to
the
people
of
the
united
states
have
abducted
your
president
and
his
wife
and
hold
them
for
ransom
they
will
not
be
delivered
up
until
their
fine
be
paid
publicly
under
full
sanction
of
congress
moreover
congress
and
the
people
must
guarantee
in
addition
to
the
full
payment
entire
liberty
to
the
abductors
permanently
to
withdraw
from
this
country
and
live
in
future
peace
unless
congress
and
the
nation
give
their
honor
for
the
payment
of
the
ransom
and
our
personal
and
impregnable
liberty
we
will
not
deliver
our
prisoners
we
impose
a
ransom
of
a
million
dollars
apiece
for
each
week
for
such
time
as
this
offer
may
remain
unaccepted
the
time
begins
from
date
of
capture
these
conditions
are
final
when
the
country
through
its
representatives
accedes
to
this
demand
the
time
and
place
of
delivery
will
be
published
in
these
columns
the
loyalty
and
honor
of
the
nation
are
now
on
exhibition
before
the
this
communication
burst
like
dynamite
upon
the
people
did
it
not
bear
an
undeniable
stamp
of
genuineness
upon
its
face
not
only
through
the
firmness
of
its
tone
but
by
the
audacity
of
the
demand
yet
there
was
an
equal
division
of
opinion
some
thought
it
was
the
raving
of
a
crank
in
search
of
notoriety
but
others
looked
upon
it
as
a
veritable
communication
from
those
who
held
the
president
and
his
wife
in
their
possession
two
millions
of
dollars
a
week
a
princely
ransom
worthy
of
a
royal
couple
and
of
the
united
states
it
was
natural
that
the
handwriting
of
this
letter
should
be
scrutinized
severely
every
ingenuity
that
detective
art
could
devise
for
finding
the
sender
was
employed
during
the
next
few
days
new
york
underwent
an
espionage
worthy
of
the
court
of
st
petersburg
but
to
the
utter
mortification
of
inspector
byrnes
and
his
myriads
of
pinkerton
and
his
myrmidons
they
were
bound
to
confess
their
utter
failure
the
perpetrators
of
the
incredible
deed
like
an
arm
clothed
in
white
samite
mystic
wonderful
brandished
the
sword
in
the
air
and
disappeared
in
the
meantime
the
political
nation
was
aroused
it
experienced
some
measure
of
relief
to
know
if
it
were
true
that
its
chief
was
held
for
paltry
gold
in
that
case
he
and
his
would
be
safe
from
the
sword
or
the
vengeance
of
an
alien
party
whose
hatred
he
had
incurred
by
patriotic
scorn
in
his
inaugural
address
an
yet
the
question
was
raised
whether
some
treasonable
secret
society
had
not
secluded
him
hoping
to
increase
its
revenue
at
the
expense
of
the
united
states
treasury
many
went
so
far
as
to
pronounce
it
a
fenian
plot
to
raise
money
for
parnell
in
his
final
overthrow
of
english
rule
in
ireland
constituents
wrote
to
their
representatives
in
washington
instructing
them
to
vote
the
ransom
without
delay
from
the
surplus
fund
which
was
now
one
hundred
and
million
dollars
others
instructed
them
not
to
waste
the
public
money
as
the
president
and
his
spouse
must
soon
be
found
by
competent
detectives
and
thus
a
creditable
saving
to
the
treasury
would
be
made
the
who
had
succeeded
to
full
powers
sent
a
special
message
to
congress
requesting
it
to
vote
the
ransom
no
matter
how
enormous
the
strain
on
him
was
not
worth
the
people
money
so
congress
met
in
secret
session
and
spent
the
balance
of
the
week
fighting
temporizing
and
receiving
telegrams
to
the
effect
that
new
clews
were
found
on
the
of
june
exactly
two
weeks
from
the
time
of
the
distinguished
capture
the
following
epigrammatic
communication
was
printed
by
the
new
york
in
the
same
handwriting
as
the
previous
one
the
envelope
bore
a
chicago
postmark
has
disregarded
our
generous
offer
the
ransom
for
the
president
of
the
united
states
and
for
his
wife
is
therefore
raised
two
million
this
was
all
cold
and
ominous
like
the
first
message
it
was
unsigned
the
style
was
unrelenting
and
imperious
citizens
awoke
to
the
sensation
that
they
who
were
now
the
nation
martyrs
were
in
the
hands
of
men
who
would
not
shrink
from
enforcing
their
demand
it
was
now
universally
believed
that
these
were
bulletins
sent
by
the
unscrupulous
abductors
themselves
this
became
the
detectives
final
theory
and
they
massed
their
skill
towards
it
the
unsolved
mystery
brooded
like
over
man
woman
and
child
a
nameless
fear
that
of
an
unknown
and
irresistible
enemy
in
their
midst
paralyzed
the
citizens
prayers
were
offered
in
every
church
and
home
the
hostilities
that
but
lately
threatened
the
country
ceased
civilization
breathed
nothing
but
sympathy
for
the
bereaved
republic
sovereigns
redoubled
their
private
guards
and
quaked
upon
their
thrones
and
yet
in
the
face
of
fears
petitions
and
threats
congress
in
a
spirit
of
disastrous
conservatism
that
has
marked
so
many
of
its
deliberations
allowed
itself
to
be
ruled
by
a
dissenting
minority
detective
byrnes
hoping
to
gain
imperishable
credit
and
also
the
reward
of
five
hundred
thousand
dollars
which
congress
had
been
liberal
enough
to
offer
counselled
delay
in
a
private
letter
to
the
speaker
of
the
house
so
it
happened
that
this
august
body
would
not
ratify
the
overwhelming
vote
for
immediate
payment
of
ransom
which
had
just
been
passed
by
the
senate
this
filibustering
brought
the
country
into
the
third
week
of
the
calamity
the
following
communication
to
the
new
york
postmarked
boston
written
in
the
same
hand
as
before
brought
matters
to
a
crisis
nation
has
evidently
more
love
for
their
surplus
than
for
their
president
the
requisite
ransom
has
reached
six
millions
of
dollars
in
gold
the
treasury
is
not
yet
exhausted
nor
are
we
none
can
find
us
our
defences
are
unapproachable
we
laugh
at
your
attempts
the
wife
of
your
president
we
are
grieved
to
say
is
this
proclamation
aroused
a
new
element
which
had
been
smouldering
to
white
heat
the
women
of
the
country
rose
they
fired
old
societies
and
organized
new
to
collect
ransom
the
and
and
and
a
and
q
b
thrilled
to
the
occasion
infant
bands
of
hope
and
daughters
of
endeavor
invaded
private
families
with
demands
for
penny
subscriptions
weeping
women
persuaded
dollars
by
the
tens
hundreds
and
thousands
from
responsive
men
they
renounced
their
and
new
dresses
parties
and
dowries
in
their
patriotic
fervor
the
presidents
of
all
the
women
societies
in
the
land
trooped
to
washington
they
cried
shame
at
those
who
trifled
for
the
sake
of
the
fiftieth
part
of
the
gold
in
the
vaults
with
the
noblest
life
in
the
union
these
unselfish
women
stormed
the
capital
and
literally
poured
two
millions
of
dollars
which
they
had
collected
in
less
than
three
days
upon
the
floor
of
the
house
to
rescue
the
first
lady
of
the
land
from
who
knew
what
they
forced
their
husbands
their
representatives
to
do
their
bidding
and
the
final
vote
was
passed
amid
indescribable
scenes
the
ransom
was
now
ready
for
the
president
and
their
lady
it
had
to
be
accompanied
by
the
national
promise
to
secure
freedom
to
those
who
delivered
up
the
suffering
couple
that
was
the
third
of
july
still
the
impotence
of
the
nation
in
this
new
crisis
filled
thoughtful
men
with
apprehension
was
it
moral
that
cash
instead
of
justice
should
be
given
to
these
stupendous
criminals
what
a
precedent
for
infamous
success
of
what
avail
courts
of
law
and
prisons
if
such
consummate
daring
goes
unpunished
is
there
a
portion
of
our
national
machinery
out
of
gear
if
so
which
nevertheless
the
excitement
was
now
beyond
fever
heat
it
is
safe
to
say
that
the
temperature
of
the
people
had
risen
ten
degrees
when
the
news
was
flashed
abroad
that
the
president
money
as
it
was
called
had
been
unanimously
voted
by
congress
tears
streamed
as
patriots
met
each
other
many
developed
a
new
species
of
insanity
in
their
suspense
the
country
had
now
done
its
part
toward
the
rescue
of
its
chief
magistrate
and
of
his
perishing
consort
would
the
abductors
be
true
to
their
portion
of
the
contract
party
strife
had
been
forgotten
in
this
new
anguish
all
fourth
of
july
demonstrations
had
been
postponed
until
a
loving
people
thanksgiving
for
their
president
safety
could
blend
with
the
time
honored
celebration
of
a
nation
birth
but
suspense
was
not
long
delayed
promptly
the
new
york
received
a
manifesto
this
time
the
last
sent
by
the
to
congress
and
the
people
this
envelope
was
boldly
postmarked
washington
this
fact
made
those
in
the
capital
city
almost
afraid
to
stir
from
their
homes
lest
unawares
they
might
meet
the
demon
in
their
midst
who
had
dwarfed
all
principals
in
the
records
of
crime
up
to
the
present
date
but
this
final
proclamation
read
as
follows
to
congress
and
all
americans
note
your
late
and
liberal
response
to
our
proposal
we
shall
not
be
outdone
in
the
honorable
discharge
of
obligations
at
precisely
eight
on
the
morning
of
july
sixth
the
payment
of
ransom
and
delivery
of
captives
will
take
place
within
one
mile
of
washington
homestead
mt
vernon
the
government
vessel
with
ransom
and
proper
officials
on
board
will
remain
in
near
sight
of
mt
vernon
at
our
signal
which
shall
consist
of
four
japanese
day
rockets
each
representing
a
flaming
sword
whether
hurled
from
land
or
water
the
officers
of
the
government
will
steam
toward
the
place
of
delivery
guards
will
fall
back
immediately
upon
the
discharge
of
whistling
bombs
until
the
ransom
and
the
ransomed
meet
the
presidential
party
will
bear
a
flag
vertically
striped
black
and
crimson
on
its
centre
will
be
a
gold
payment
must
be
made
as
follows
there
must
be
eighty
leathern
bags
each
containing
one
hundred
thousand
dollars
in
gold
the
amount
of
ransom
being
eight
million
dollars
for
four
weeks
board
at
one
million
dollars
a
week
apiece
this
money
must
be
paid
and
its
genuineness
certificated
upon
the
honor
of
the
united
states
by
the
secretaries
of
state
and
of
the
treasury
if
there
is
any
suspicion
of
infidelity
on
the
part
of
the
nation
the
president
and
his
wife
will
be
held
for
another
month
on
the
same
terms
should
we
be
betrayed
in
the
trust
which
we
have
reposed
in
the
american
people
on
the
of
july
at
or
previous
to
the
time
of
delivery
the
distinguished
hostages
will
immediately
be
put
permanently
beyond
reach
of
unscrupulous
and
stern
was
the
message
yet
tinged
with
a
spurious
color
of
honor
that
demanded
the
true
blue
in
return
it
was
the
consensus
of
opinion
that
it
would
be
madness
to
attempt
arrest
during
the
culminative
ceremonies
the
required
gold
was
transferred
from
the
treasury
vaults
to
the
new
and
swift
cruiser
final
arrangements
were
made
for
giving
the
imprisoned
couple
the
most
glorious
reception
which
ingenuity
and
patriotism
could
devise
reporters
by
hundreds
bivouacked
on
the
grounds
of
mt
vernon
on
the
night
of
the
fifth
gunboats
steamers
yachts
and
sail
of
every
description
congregated
to
the
scene
of
the
surrender
the
land
teemed
with
and
soldiers
with
stacked
arms
in
the
midst
of
all
this
apparent
disorder
inspector
byrnes
on
his
own
responsibility
had
his
thousand
trained
men
who
patrolled
every
foot
of
ground
within
five
miles
of
the
historic
site
and
who
had
surveyed
every
inch
of
water
from
the
mouth
of
the
potomac
to
the
city
of
washington
he
had
hoped
to
retrieve
his
fame
by
a
successful
capture
at
the
eleventh
hour
at
last
though
it
seemed
a
century
in
coming
the
morning
of
the
sixth
of
july
broke
solemnly
upon
mt
vernon
the
revered
site
was
flanked
on
all
sides
by
seething
excited
hopeful
humanity
such
as
these
historic
shores
had
never
before
witnessed
the
official
command
had
been
to
abstain
from
all
noise
and
confusion
on
land
or
water
from
the
time
of
the
sunrise
gun
the
cannon
boomed
from
the
new
navy
then
came
the
hush
the
last
hours
of
waiting
were
spent
in
maddening
inactivity
in
strained
repose
from
what
quarter
would
the
ominous
signal
be
seen
who
would
catch
the
first
glimpse
of
the
boldest
and
most
successful
gang
of
malefactors
that
this
country
had
ever
produced
part
ii
colonel
oddminton
was
a
widower
with
only
one
son
fifteen
years
old
it
was
natural
then
that
the
colonel
himself
should
balance
between
and
fifty
years
of
age
let
the
fact
only
be
whispered
in
desert
places
that
the
colonel
was
no
more
a
colonel
than
you
are
he
had
never
smelt
powder
except
when
shooting
mallard
ducks
he
never
had
seen
a
regiment
except
when
it
was
marching
on
decoration
day
peacefully
through
the
woebegone
streets
of
charleston
preparatory
to
a
good
dinner
his
nearest
idea
of
regalia
and
medals
consisted
of
the
many

fellows
or
any
other
order
of
honorable
unextinguished
redskins
as
they
either
laid
a
or
a
comrade
ceremoniously
in
the
ground
where
could
he
have
lived
and
not
have
been
an
active
partisan
in
the
stirring
days
of
our
devastating
civil
war
surely
not
in
the
united
states
of
english
exile
blood
that
came
over
a
hundred
years
ago
he
would
have
been
a
thorough
american
had
his
parents
and
his
environment
permitted
his
family
had
settled
on
one
of
the
many
sea
islands
that
dot
the
coast
of
south
carolina
and
there
they
had
staid
and
raised
the
famous
sea
island
cotton
which
is
still
successfully
used
so
fine
its
fibre
to
adulterate
a
fashionable
fabric
like
the
baryte
of
cheshire
the
cotton
of
oddminton
island
became
valuable
as
it
became
an
ally
to
fraud
the
one
increased
the
weight
of
white
lead
the
other
swelled
the
unlawful
receipts
of
the
manufacturers
of
silk
oddminton
island
did
not
follow
the
regular
markets
of
trade
it
always
had
its
peculiar
channels
of
commerce
its
cotton
had
an
undiscoverable
destination
the
colonel
as
we
will
still
call
him
was
from
his
earliest
memory
sternly
brought
up
under
an
atmosphere
of
uncanniness
and
secrecy
nor
did
he
leave
his
fertile
island
except
as
we
shall
mention
until
his
father
died
and
made
him
sole
proprietor
of
land
slaves
and
family
traditions
fully
two
hundred
acres
were
under
cotton
cultivation
the
insignificant
remainder
was
unentangled
marsh
colonel
oddminton
father
died
in
eighteen
hundred
and
then
the
colonel
began
to
expand
he
had
two
hobbies
that
consumed
his
imagination
by
day
and
agitated
his
visions
by
night
the
one
had
been
shared
by
his
deceased
parent
namely
an
inordinate
desire
to
be
rich
not
as
wealthy
as
the
richest
family
in
charleston
but
as
rich
as
all
the
merchants
in
the
city
by
the
sea
put
together
cotton
had
always
given
a
comfortable
living
but
cotton
was
declining
it
became
unsatisfactory
it
was
not
enough
colonel
oddminton
other
hobby
was
a
fast
boat
he
had
always
been
a
more
than
enthusiastic
sailor
when
the
boy
was
only
eighteen
his
father
had
given
him
a
sloop
and
allowed
him
to
go
anywhere
provided
he
did
not
touch
the
mainland
this
order
was
in
accordance
with
the
old
man
peculiarities
but
was
strictly
obeyed
with
his
black
sailors
the
boy
had
cruised
in
every
bay
and
inlet
for
a
hundred
miles
about
though
no
one
else
knew
it
he
was
the
best
pilot
those
waters
ever
saw
during
the
war
when
he
was
master
he
never
left
his
island
except
to
put
his
own
cotton
aboard
english
blockade
runners
in
these
hazardous
attempts
he
never
failed
this
experience
cultivated
his
native
qualities
of
courage
and
of
on
this
island
of
his
there
was
a
bay
that
afforded
fine
anchorage
for
two
large
boats
it
abutted
on
the
marsh
it
was
there
he
had
built
a
small
camphouse
neither
the
cove
nor
the
house
could
be
seen
from
the
open
sea
the
former
could
only
be
entered
through
an
intricate
channel
and
that
when
the
wind
and
tide
were
favorable
the
latter
was
approached
through
heavy
underbrush
by
a
winding
passage
that
was
known
only
to
a
few
colonel
oddminton
was
a
tall
man
he
wore
a
long
flowing
beard
that
had
never
seen
the
razor
his
build
was
massive
his
height
was
manly
about
the
time
of
which
we
are
writing
this
was
in
but
the
reader
remembers
his
new
schooner
which
he
had
dignified
by
the
name
of
yacht
much
to
the
amusement
of
a
few
acquaintances
had
been
easily
beaten
by
a
trim
stranger
that
ploughed
its
way
to
windward
as
if
it
had
been
a
knife
eating
into
the
teeth
of
the
gale
he
had
followed
this
new
craft
to
harbor
and
found
her
to
be
a
herreshoff
model
that
night
for
the
colonel
schooner
was
really
an
able
and
fast
one
the
disappointed
man
was
sadder
than
when
he
saw
his
only
friend
his
father
die
he
was
proud
of
his
schooner
he
had
cruised
in
her
from
baltimore
to
the
john
river
and
had
never
been
so
disgracefully
and
outfooted
by
any
boat
of
her
size
before
it
was
at
this
time
that
he
fell
into
a
revery
that
lasted
a
month
it
was
the
longest
month
in
his
life
the
only
one
he
had
ever
spent
upon
the
mainland
people
pronounced
him
daft
decidedly
cracked
but
harmless
you
know
his
tall
figure
flitted
from
the
lobby
of
the
charleston
hotel
to
the
great
cotton
wharves
and
then
back
again
at
last
he
awoke
and
this
was
the
outcome
of
his
supposed
aberration
i
do
care
if
it
costs
me
my
last
cent
i
have
the
fastest
boat
in
the
world
and
no
one
shall
beat
me
again
by
gum
to
make
a
long
story
short
he
sold
to
an
eager
syndicate
of
english
capitalists
his
island
for
an
asparagus
farm
reserving
for
himself
the
odd
acres
of
marsh
his
camp
house
and
bay
with
its
two
moorings
on
this
sale
he
realized
a
hundred
thousand
cash
down
he
then
turned
his
father
savings
fifty
thousand
dollars
worth
of
london
consols
into
ready
money
he
now
had
a
hundred
and
fifty
thousand
dollars
with
this
he
and
his
boat
disappeared
no
note
was
taken
of
his
absence
either
on
his
former
property
or
in
charleston
the
only
other
place
that
really
knew
him
so
frequent
were
his
vagaries
so
infrequent
his
presence
let
us
follow
the
colonel
in
his
unostentatious
wanderings
he
first
sailed
with
his
son
and
his
two
trusty
men
direct
to
washington
city
he
took
in
the
sights
of
the
capital
for
a
few
weeks
and
then
leaving
his
boat
behind
pushed
on
by
train
to
new
york
that
wonderful
metropolis
that
obliterates
or
worships
men
with
an
idea
he
took
lodgings
with
his
son
in
a
modest
and
there
met
a
swedish
sailor
a
man
who
had
been
captain
of
a
steam
yacht
during
the
summer
and
now
happened
to
be
out
of
employment
nautical
people
do
not
take
a
long
time
to
become
acquainted
colonel
oddminton
at
the
end
of
a
week
had
engaged
hans
christian
on
the
strength
of
his
name
without
further
references
at
a
salary
of
one
hundred
and
dollars
a
month
with
the
proviso
that
his
new
captain
should
hold
his
tongue
and
obey
orders
this
was
about
the
first
of
november
during
the
last
week
of
the
same
month
the
yachting
world
and
indeed
the
whole
maritime
contingency
were
interested
in
the
following
paragraph
which
was
duly
copied
and
commented
upon
by
the
national
and
foreign
press
famous
builders
the
herreshoffs
have
taken
a
contract
to
build
a
steel
yacht
that
shall
develop
the
enormous
speed
of
knots
an
hour
they
are
given
blanche
for
everything
that
pertains
to
increase
of
speed
the
new
phenomenon
will
be
about
a
hundred
and
fifty
feet
long
as
less
water
line
will
not
admit
of
the
speed
contracted
for
a
bonus
of
it
is
rumored
will
be
paid
for
each
additional
one
speed
over
the
contract
requirements
of
knots
the
engines
that
will
effect
this
speed
will
be
of
a
new
and
untried
pattern
they
will
not
be
exhibited
unless
the
vessel
prove
a
success
the
owner
of
this
phenomenal
craft
which
will
be
the
fastest
in
the
world
is
unknown
it
is
suspected
that
it
will
go
to
the
swedish
government
for
use
as
a
torpedo
boat
the
yacht
will
be
finished
in
five
months
and
her
name
is
undecided
we
should
respectfully
suggest
lightning
at
this
time
colonel
oddminton
and
his
son
began
to
travel
restlessly
they
kept
it
up
all
winter
until
the
first
of
may
the
lad
had
developed
as
much
aptness
for
the
land
as
he
had
for
the
water
there
were
two
things
the
boy
did
admirably
and
for
which
he
was
conspicuous
beyond
his
years
he
held
his
tongue
and
obeyed
his
father
moreover
he
was
clever
enough
to
take
care
of
himself
with
the
first
of
may
the
ceaseless
journeying
came
to
an
end
and
rupert
oddminton
was
sent
to
washington
to
put
his
father
old
schooner
in
readiness
for
future
orders
the
press
which
had
volunteered
during
the
winter
much
plausible
but
little
real
information
about
the
wonderful
new
herreshoff
model
now
blazed
into
the
rare
glory
of
fact
first
trial
trip
of
the
unknown
took
place
yesterday
the
marvellous
witch
astonished
spectators
by
showing
up
to
the
tune
of
knots
and
it
is
suspected
the
end
was
not
reached
this
unparalleled
speed
was
continued
for
minutes
in
favorable
weather
this
proved
the
most
successful
trial
trip
the
herreshoffs
ever
held
thus
the
singular
and
hitherto
undivulged
electric
machinery
proves
a
triumphal
hit
after
a
few
minor
changes
the
unnamed
yacht
will
be
ready
for
its
destination
who
will
own
the
fastest
ship
in
the
world
it
is
conceded
that
she
goes
to
sweden
her
crew
which
is
entirely
composed
of
swedes
is
strangely
uncommunicative
and
so
on
one
fine
day
the
magic
craft
shot
out
of
newport
harbor
and
vanished
some
said
she
went
straight
to
europe
each
daily
had
its
own
theory
the
boat
and
her
evanescence
were
a
nine
days
wonder
the
yacht
that
represented
the
most
exhaustive
skill
man
had
ever
applied
to
navigation
had
melted
away
unnamed
unlicensed
and
without
destination
even
her
builder
knew
her
no
more
the
reader
knows
as
well
as
we
that
this
triumph
of
speed
was
colonel
oddminton
venture
he
had
literally
sunk
his
all
in
it
with
maniacal
satisfaction
and
had
only
a
few
thousands
left
barely
enough
to
pay
expenses
for
three
months
he
had
pursued
his
ideal
until
he
had
her
under
foot
he
had
not
touched
the
new
yacht
until
after
it
had
left
the
world
in
wonder
he
had
now
met
her
on
the
high
seas
in
his
old
schooner
and
the
four
himself
his
boy
rupert
and
the
two
black
sailors
with
sad
eyes
scuttled
the
home
of
many
years
when
the
colonel
foot
touched
his
new
bright
deck
captain
christian
nodded
and
the
blue
flag
to
starboard
of
the
mainmast
signifying
owner
absent
was
hauled
down
the
crew
beheld
their
master
for
the
first
time
not
a
sail
was
in
sight
the
colonel
was
dazed
he
went
below
gulped
down
a
pint
of
whiskey
and
tried
to
think
he
was
intoxicated
not
on
liquor
but
on
final
possession
when
he
came
aloft
spray
was
whistling
from
stem
to
stern
and
behind
was
a
wake
that
overtopped
the
racer
itself
water
rushed
as
though
projected
through
a
pipe
past
the
shining
sides
of
the
vessel
colonel
oddminton
in
a
trance
leaned
over
and
touched
the
steel
plates
carefully
he
expected
to
feel
the
heat
generated
by
the
tremendous
friction
captain
hans
christian
stood
respectfully
at
his
side
what
speed
does
she
register
captain
asked
the
owner
with
a
tremulousness
new
to
the
man
only
knots
sir
in
this
chop
but
we
can
drive
her
i
think
she
can
go
forty
on
the
hardest
push
only
the
owner
of
nancy
hanks
the
fastest
racing
horse
the
world
has
yet
produced
can
imagine
the
sensations
of
the
colonel
at
this
answer
what
is
the
speed
of
the
fastest
government
boat
he
asked
with
deliberation
knots
sir
was
the
quick
reply
they
only
two
torpedo
boats
that
go
that
and
they
are
always
up
for
repairs
as
for
or
cruisers
none
average
over
twenty
a
common
ocean
steamer
can
beat
them
out
this
last
was
uttered
with
the
contemptuousness
one
always
feels
toward
a
mighty
government
that
allows
itself
to
be
outdone
by
corporations
or
individuals
suppose
you
change
her
top
hampers
and
make
her
so
that
no
one
can
recognize
her
say
tack
on
a
false
stem
and
stern
to
the
water
line
will
she
still
go
as
fast
continued
the
colonel
cautiously
certainly
provided
you
do
interfere
with
her
hull
answered
the
captain
in
surprise
i
will
take
the
wheel
the
colonel
said
the
electric
vessel
from
whose
wheel
there
was
an
unobstructed
view
ahead
without
smokestack
with
masts
that
could
for
speed
sake
be
lowered
was
steered
like
any
from
her
heaving
stern
the
owner
hand
marked
half
speed
quarter
speed
upon
the
indicator
to
the
disgust
of
the
crew
he
gave
orders
not
to
have
the
speed
increased
except
to
keep
out
of
sight
of
coasters
at
dead
of
night
the
beauty
was
anchored
in
his
own
cove
opposite
his
clapboard
shooting
lodge
on
the
marsh
no
one
noticed
his
approach
the
marsh
and
the
bay
hid
their
secret
the
next
day
at
dawn
a
transformation
began
to
take
place
the
white
paint
the
original
and
dainty
body
color
of
the
electric
yacht
was
changed
to
a
dull
gray
and
the
new
coat
looked
as
if
it
had
been
put
on
in
amateur
patches
so
dingy
was
its
appearance
the
boats
on
the
davits
were
touched
up
with
a
combination
of
green
and
black
they
looked
at
first
glance
as
if
a
collier
might
have
lost
them
at
sea
the
electric
launch
was
smeared
with
the
refuse
of
the
paintshop
put
into
one
pot
the
mixture
attained
was
indescribable
but
by
far
the
greatest
change
consisted
of
a
false
stem
and
stern
these
were
modelled
and
put
on
so
that
after
a
few
screws
were
drawn
the
mask
would
slip
off
leaving
the
original
sheer
of
the
boat
in
all
its
beauty
a
large
smokestack
of
hollow
timber
painted
black
with
a
red
stripe
was
improvised
and
set
up
this
ornament
led
into
the
galley
stove
below
and
the
cook
was
instructed
to
burn
smoky
materials
when
on
the
run
the
deck
was
then
covered
with
canvas
and
painted
a
sickly
yellow
the
brass
work
went
unpolished
as
may
be
imagined
the
new
model
was
as
different
from
the
old
as
the
carefully
disguised
ruffian
on
the
stage
is
from
his
elegant
self
now
she
is
ready
said
colonel
oddminton
to
his
captain
i
will
double
the
wages
of
all
on
board
if
the
crew
does
not
leave
the
ship
or
converse
with
any
person
off
of
it
except
by
order
my
two
colored
men
will
get
all
supplies
the
future
speed
of
my
boat
will
be
eight
knots
an
hour
she
is
incapable
of
going
more
that
is
her
limit
until
further
orders
give
command
for
an
immediate
start
we
will
now
go
to
charleston
the
son
and
the
crew
from
the
captain
down
suspected
that
something
was
in
contemplation
out
of
the
usual
run
of
pleasure
trips
the
son
dared
ask
his
father
no
questions
though
he
burned
with
indignation
at
the
vandal
changes
the
crew
did
not
care
even
if
they
went
pirating
nothing
could
overtake
them
their
fuel
was
limitless
their
pay
was
princely
their
cook
was
supreme
these
stolid
natures
obeyed
orders
and
drew
their
rations
with
faithful
punctuality
it
does
not
take
long
to
run
to
charleston
going
at
even
so
slow
a
pace
small
steamers
ply
daily
between
the
sea
islands
and
the
cotton
metropolis
it
happened
that
some
of
the
colonel
acquaintances
were
on
board
one
of
the
passenger
boats
and
they
saw
this
new
craft
lumbering
along
puffing
out
volumes
of
black
smoke
they
slowed
up
and
were
soon
overtaken
by
the
strange
boat
the
colonel
was
sitting
on
deck
halloa
one
of
them
yelled
laughing
where
did
you
pick
up
that
thing
colonel
oh
down
in
new
york
she
an
steamer
i
have
had
time
to
get
her
fixed
up
yet
answered
the
colonel
i
always
wanted
a
steam
yacht
and
i
got
this
cheap
the
passengers
set
up
a
laugh
we
race
you
in
spoke
up
one
of
the
colonel
acquaintances
with
a
wink
at
the
others
the
man
knew
the
colonel
weakness
when
he
challenged
him
all
right
said
the
colonel
briskly
john
yelling
forward
tell
the
engineers
to
put
more
steam
on
and
let
her
go
new
puffs
of
smoke
came
from
the
bogus
smokestack
the
sidewheeler
increased
her
pressure
it
forged
ahead
at
its
highest
speed
ten
knots
and
no
more
colonel
oddminton
swore
but
to
no
effect
the
passenger
vessel
left
the
colonel
behind
amid
jeers
and
all
the
catcalls
familiar
to
southern
methods
of
demonstration
the
colonel
seemed
heartbroken
when
he
into
charleston
harbor
two
hours
after
his
ancient
rival
the
wharf
was
crowded
with
the
colonel
friends
when
the
colonel
came
ashore
he
dropped
a
few
characteristic
oaths
ordered
drinks
all
around
and
said
that
after
the
that
was
the
name
painted
on
her
was
prinked
up
and
her
bottom
scoured
she
would
beat
the
best
of
them
yet
he
had
great
faith
in
her
possibilities
at
any
rate
she
could
go
in
a
calm
similar
performances
were
repeated
for
a
week
the
colonel
planned
it
to
get
to
the
city
in
the
morning
and
he
went
back
at
night
until
charleston
was
thoroughly
familiar
with
his
ridiculously
antique
yacht
and
had
joked
itself
tired
at
his
expense
soon
an
elopement
and
a
murder
tickled
the
palate
of
the
city
and
the
colonel
and
the
were
forgotten
when
that
stage
was
reached
charleston
knew
him
no
more
it
was
now
the
second
of
june
and
the
turned
her
ugly
prow
toward
the
mouth
of
the
potomac
river
every
one
knows
that
the
potomac
empties
itself
into
the
chesapeake
bay
the
potomac
is
between
ninety
and
a
hundred
miles
long
in
its
tortuous
route
from
washington
to
the
bay
at
its
mouth
are
many
inlets
each
one
of
these
was
known
to
rupert
and
the
two
negro
sailors
it
was
in
the
most
retired
estuary
that
the
cast
anchor
on
the
evening
of
the
fifth
of
june
at
her
normal
rate
of
speed
she
lay
within
two
and
a
half
hours
run
of
the
capital
at
nine
at
black
of
night
she
started
for
washington
her
registered
knots
an
hour
she
hugged
the
shore
where
she
laid
for
safe
passage
until
she
modestly
crept
to
an
anchorage
near
a
city
wharf
then
the
colonel
went
ashore
with
his
two
black
men
and
two
swedes
to
reconnoitre
the
town
he
always
took
with
him
a
preparation
of
chloroform
and
another
drug
which
for
the
sake
of
public
safety
we
will
not
mention
this
was
compounded
for
him
in
chicago
by
a
chemist
formerly
in
the
employ
of
anarchists
this
preparation
was
warranted
to
make
a
man
who
smelled
it
lose
consciousness
in
less
time
that
it
takes
to
say
herr
most
when
colonel
oddminton
was
last
in
washington
a
casual
acquaintance
remarked
eying
him
with
the
gaze
of
a
professional
physiognomist
if
you
shave
off
your
chin
and
keep
your
hat
on
you
be
the
very
picture
of
senator
x
now
senator
x
through
a
revolution
of
the
political
wheel
had
become
secretary
of
state
that
casual
remark
had
penetrated
into
the
imagination
of
the
colonel
he
tried
to
shake
the
impression
off
flattered
by
this
suggestion
no
one
had
ever
made
it
before
he
bought
photographs
of
the
senator
all
he
could
find
and
studied
them
diligently
for
days
he
haunted
the
senate
chamber
and
learned
the
personnel
of
the
senator
by
heart
this
it
will
be
remembered
was
in
the
last
administration
then
was
born
the
thought
why
not
make
capital
out
of
this
resemblance
which
art
could
easily
magnify
the
senator
was
a
millionaire
there
might
be
money
in
it
but
this
seemed
after
all
rather
impracticable
and
rather
commonplace
the
colonel
was
no
sneak
thief
he
had
broader
elements
than
that
the
man
but
not
the
blood
was
ignorant
that
his
grandfather
was
hung
for
piracy
in
england
it
would
be
impossible
to
state
when
the
stupendous
plot
which
he
finally
executed
shaped
itself
in
his
subtile
brain
this
idea
startled
him
haunted
him
conquered
him
why
not
kidnap
the
president
of
the
united
states
demand
a
ransom
and
throw
suspicion
for
a
time
at
least
upon
the
wily
politician
his
thoughts
now
worked
only
in
that
conduit
jacobi
said
that
the
greater
a
ability
to
act
for
distant
ends
the
stronger
his
mind
the
colonel
silently
plotted
for
months
we
see
where
it
had
led
him
having
studiously
perfected
himself
in
the
rôle
of
secretary
which
he
was
prepared
to
play
at
a
moment
notice
the
colonel
spent
the
remainder
of
these
last
nights
in
washington
awaiting
an
opportunity
to
capture
the
secretary
coach
after
it
had
been
dismissed
by
its
owner
for
the
night
he
also
kept
himself
closely
informed
of
the
president
habits
and
his
simple
domestic
hours
without
arousing
any
suspicion
all
washington
knew
the
customs
of
its
unostentatious
chief
society
had
criticised
his
affected
democratic
ways
every
one
knew
that
he
habitually
retired
as
early
as
a
new
england
deacon
never
later
than
eleven
white
house
dissipation
was
now
out
of
season
the
colonel
knew
that
the
interior
of
the
executive
mansion
was
unguarded
at
night
could
he
once
gain
access
thereto
the
rest
of
his
plot
so
ignorant
and
so
trustworthy
his
tools
could
not
miscarry
the
colonel
made
the
attempt
for
three
consecutive
nights
to
capture
the
secretary
coach
he
arrived
each
time
in
washington
between
eleven
and
twelve
he
knew
the
approaches
to
the
stable
and
luckily
for
him
on
the
dark
night
of
the
eighth
of
june
he
accomplished
his
design
how
successfully
the
reader
well
knows
the
strategic
colonel
with
his
four
devoted
men
invaded
the
privacy
of
the
white
house
at
exactly
quarter
of
two
in
the
morning
he
had
the
aid
of
a
card
taken
from
the
case
in
the
coupé
and
the
of
his
now
marvellous
resemblance
what
he
now
did
the
veriest
tyro
could
have
performed
he
had
not
meant
to
abduct
the
first
lady
of
the
land
but
what
could
he
do
with
her
his
native
chivalry
would
not
permit
him
to
harm
her
though
the
president
was
made
unconscious
by
the
aid
of
the
chicago
anæsthetic
the
wife
entreated
to
accompany
her
husband
she
would
undergo
any
fate
so
that
he
should
not
be
taken
without
her
on
condition
of
perfect
quiet
her
wish
was
gratified
she
was
softly
led
the
president
was
carried
down
the
deserted
stairs
the
familiar
state
coach
bore
the
distinguished
victims
away
and
the
deed
that
baffled
the
detective
skill
of
the
country
was
done
with
an
ease
which
seems
ridiculous
the
next
evening
the
president
and
his
wife
might
have
been
seen
by
inspector
byrnes
had
he
been
there
silently
sitting
on
the
deck
of
a
vessel
bearing
name
and
anchored
in
a
little
cove
off
a
swamp
and
cottage
on
oddminton
island
so
remote
and
quiet
was
this
locality
that
the
rumor
of
the
president
effacement
had
not
even
reached
it
the
kidnapped
couple
waited
patiently
for
the
relief
that
they
momentarily
expected
they
had
no
news
nothing
but
scrupulous
consideration
attention
and
a
respectful
but
firm
guard
night
and
day
but
rescue
did
not
come
one
member
of
that
dark
crew
was
left
in
washington
to
hold
continual
communication
with
the
colonel
this
was
the
boy
rupert
who
if
he
had
suspected
by
this
time
what
had
happened
was
either
too
loyal
or
too
terrified
to
reveal
the
fact
the
letters
that
astonished
the
world
were
written
by
the
colonel
sent
to
his
son
sealed
directed
each
in
a
different
handwriting
and
stamped
with
full
instructions
how
and
where
to
mail
them
the
boy
had
travelled
faithfully
and
far
of
course
a
letter
posted
by
an
boy
of
fifteen
who
was
unsuspected
and
unknown
was
able
to
baffle
the
law
he
was
the
only
confederate
a
helpless
and
faithful
tool
a
country
that
opens
itself
in
so
many
ways
to
foreign
foes
must
not
be
startled
if
one
of
its
own
sons
perceiving
the
weakness
of
the
armor
should
take
advantage
of
it
and
choose
his
direction
for
the
vital
thrust
the
colonel
aimed
high
he
kept
his
counsel
and
accomplished
the
incredible
in
the
simplest
way
who
thought
of
him
and
the
crazy
the
president
and
his
wife
were
as
far
away
from
rescue
as
if
they
were
on
the
island
of
borneo
there
are
a
thousand
such
places
on
our
coast
where
a
hostile
fleet
might
ride
without
even
the
suspicion
of
our
lord
high
admiral
it
was
ten
minutes
of
eight
on
the
morning
of
the
eighth
of
july
a
fleet
of
many
hundred
vessels
of
every
description
lined
the
banks
of
the
potomac
opposite
the
revered
home
of
washington
there
were
gunboats
and
catboats
excursion
steamers
and
yachts
from
every
part
of
the
country
they
idly
lay
at
anchor
or
jogged
barely
enough
to
hold
their
own
in
the
tidal
river
all
flags
hung
at
while
most
eyes
scanned
the
heights
with
impatient
glance
others
watched
the
water
for
a
revelation
the
sides
of
the
hills
were
black
with
humanity
the
world
seemed
to
wait
there
with
a
throe
of
hope
subsiding
to
an
interval
of
despair
the
high
officials
of
the
government
were
standing
on
the
of
the
new
each
had
a
pair
of
glasses
to
his
intent
eyes
this
was
the
moment
when
the
secretary
of
state
from
his
high
elevation
spied
a
long
low
vessel
moving
slowly
amid
the
floating
palaces
and
dreary
hulks
it
seemed
apologetic
in
its
movements
and
afforded
a
sad
contrast
to
the
jaunty
yachts
it
almost
grazed
none
but
the
secretary
had
as
yet
noticed
this
in
significant
boat
somehow
it
fascinated
him
and
he
followed
it
intently
it
was
propelled
by
steam
and
crept
up
as
if
it
wanted
a
nearer
view
of
the
morning
performance
now
a
police
patrol
launch
whistled
that
way
and
gave
the
sailor
at
the
wheel
an
abrupt
command
to
bring
her
up
to
a
stop
hardly
was
this
order
given
when
there
came
a
puff
of
smoke
from
her
uncouth
bow
and
an
ominous
flaming
sword
appeared
against
the
dead
gray
sky
a
sound
that
could
at
first
have
been
mistaken
for
a
subterranean
growl
rolled
upon
the
still
air
when
the
second
flaming
sword
flashed
into
the
mutter
of
the
populace
became
a
roar
it
was
true
true
the
president
and
their
lady
were
at
hand
and
in
their
midst
two
more
rockets
gleamed
above
was
it
execration
or
was
it
joy
this
mighty
sound
that
broke
from
river
to
shore
then
silence
came
again
eyes
strained
to
see
this
mysterious
thing
that
made
straight
for
the
great
but
one
soul
was
seen
on
its
dingy
decks
only
the
man
at
the
wheel
was
visible
he
was
clad
in
black
a
hundred
vessels
instinctively
closed
about
this
daring
and
defiant
craft
its
escape
was
cut
off
it
could
neither
go
to
the
right
nor
to
the
left
forward
nor
back
it
sullenly
stopped
then
came
a
whistling
shriek
followed
by
a
cannon
peal
from
its
forequarter
another
and
the
flag
of
black
and
crimson
crowned
by
the
gilt
eagle
touched
by
unseen
hands
shot
like
a
baleful
spirit
from
the
peak
keep
off
shouted
a
stern
voice
from
the
bow
keep
off
ahead
there
let
the
nation
stand
back
at
the
peril
of
their
chief
magistrate
now
the
mystery
swung
ahead
until
she
was
abreast
of
the
high
warship
any
one
of
whose
lowering
guns
would
have
gladly
shattered
her
if
it
had
dared
when
the
execrable
vessel
came
to
a
halt
and
breathless
and
dignified
faces
peered
upon
her
decks
from
above
a
sudden
bustle
was
observed
from
below
there
mounted
slowly
his
excellency
the
president
of
the
united
states
attended
by
the
first
lady
of
the
land
both
looked
pale
and
anxious
but
bore
signs
of
powerful
at
sight
of
the
revered
couple
the
crew
could
not
control
themselves
and
set
up
a
mighty
cheer
this
was
caught
up
from
ship
to
ship
from
shore
to
height
flags
were
hauled
aloft
guns
were
discharged
a
pandemonium
of
joy
set
in
behind
the
captured
couple
two
men
in
black
walked
each
with
a
cocked
revolver
the
honored
pair
reclined
on
steamer
chairs
in
full
view
of
their
people
the
world
knew
now
that
they
were
safe
and
nearly
home
greetings
were
exchanged
between
cabinet
and
chief
even
veterans
could
not
choke
down
the
rising
apple
in
their
throats
again
there
was
a
hush
a
figure
now
stepped
from
a
forward
hatchway
on
deck
of
the
walked
up
to
the
captured
couple
and
bowed
low
this
salute
was
succeeded
by
a
courteous
recognition
of
the
impatient
crowd
above
on
board
the
as
the
unknown
raised
his
silk
hat
for
the
second
time
he
stood
directly
in
line
with
the
secretary
of
state
the
secretary
of
state
and
oddminton
regarded
each
other
bystanders
started
in
surprise
the
resemblance
between
the
two
men
was
deeply
suggestive
of
the
success
of
the
plot
the
villain
had
the
same
noble
brow
the
same
delicate
complexion
the
same
incomparable
whiskers
but
alas
he
was
bald
on
the
top
of
his
head
the
secretary
involuntarily
stroked
his
own
luxuriant
crown
with
a
sigh
of
relief
gentlemen
representatives
of
these
united
states
said
the
colonel
slowly
i
have
faithfully
fulfilled
my
part
of
the
contract
do
you
yours
i
will
come
aboard
and
inspect
the
ransom
then
it
may
be
lowered
down
and
the
president
is
free
i
have
not
long
to
stay
in
the
meanwhile
so
intent
were
all
eyes
upon
the
star
actors
of
this
scene
it
was
not
noticed
that
men
were
busily
engaged
at
stem
and
stern
of
the
steamer
hands
worked
deftly
at
masts
and
funnel
after
a
few
minutes
during
which
the
expectant
couple
sat
with
as
much
comfort
as
one
can
before
loaded
pistols
the
ransom
was
inspected
the
colonel
satisfied
eighty
bags
of
gold
were
carefully
lowered
to
the
pirate
craft
as
the
colonel
descended
alone
to
his
own
deck
he
motioned
with
his
hand
immediately
the
pistols
were
flung
into
the
water
the
seamen
in
black
fell
back
as
a
guard
of
honor
the
colonel
with
southern
grace
and
british
dignity
extended
his
arm
to
the
distinguished
and
trembling
hostage
this
she
did
not
refuse
and
he
led
her
to
the
companionway
that
now
reached
from
the
to
the
the
marines
presented
arms
the
women
sobbed
then
came
the
president
when
his
foot
touched
his
own
deck
there
thundered
forth
a
salute
of
guns
from
the
american
navy
whistles
blew
flags
and
handkerchiefs
fluttered
and
mad
salvos
rent
the
air
from
subjects
that
any
sovereign
would
gladly
call
his
own
the
president
now
looked
down
with
sad
curiosity
upon
his
former
prison
but
there
strange
things
had
happened
the
caterpillar
had
cast
off
its
chrysalis
and
the
incomparable
butterfly
appeared
where
was
the
smokestack
where
were
the
masts
where
was
the
a
load
seemed
to
fall
from
stem
to
stern
and
there
appeared
beneath
dingy
paint
a
sheer
which
a
king
might
long
to
possess
this
was
the
crowning
surprise
naval
officers
now
recognized
for
the
first
time
the
nautical
marvel
which
had
deluded
the
nation
the
colonel
stood
alone
upon
the
deck
of
the
transfigured
boat
with
uncovered
head
he
spoke
his
left
hand
grasped
the
wheel
president
i
have
guarded
you
safely
and
treated
you
as
well
as
circumstances
could
permit
your
patience
in
adversity
and
that
of
your
wife
have
compelled
my
reverence
you
were
but
the
scapegoat
of
a
nation
this
country
can
never
afford
to
be
careless
of
its
defences
and
of
the
treasures
which
they
protect
people
of
america
you
regard
me
as
the
chief
malefactor
of
your
times
the
day
may
come
when
you
will
call
me
its
greatest
benefactor
you
execrate
me
you
may
bless
me
i
have
taught
you
a
solemn
and
a
costly
lesson
but
the
price
of
such
wisdom
is
cheap
there
was
no
opening
but
the
hawsers
were
suddenly
cut
there
was
a
rush
and
billows
of
foam
as
a
cat
plays
here
and
there
in
her
pretty
antics
the
for
a
blow
of
the
hammer
on
the
stern
had
annihilated
the
wound
in
and
out
at
an
unequal
rate
when
she
turned
she
careened
far
over
on
her
side
the
water
lapped
the
colonel
feet
who
could
stop
her
who
could

motionless
then
sprang
to
their
guns
the
president
of
the
army

raised
his
hand
and
shook
his
head
the
faith
of
the
nation
was
pledged
and
the
pirate
escaped
without
a
shot
the
incredible
speed
of
the
increased
it
became
terrific
nothing
like
it
had
ever
been
witnessed
in
maritime
history
spectators
stood
with
held
breath
a
lieutenant
in
his
excitement
shouted
for
god
sake
overtake

the
crowd
yelled
run
them
down

where
they
go
but
the
navy
of
the
united

might
as
well
have
chased
a
cannon
ball
the
mental
pressure
became
tremendous
spectators
had
hardly
drawn
a
breath
when
the
miracle
was
hull
down
the
american
love
of
audacity
and
speed
struggled
mightily
for
the
moment
with
american
patriotism
the
moral
sense
of
the
people
could
not
prevent
a
murmur
of
admiration
when
the
with
eight
millions
of
national
gold
aboard
in
less
than
nine
minutes
was
but
a
speck
a
bend
of
the
river
and
the
mysterious
courtly
and
successful
pirate
was
gone
the
lost
city
i
great
guns
the
ejaculator
tipped
his
straw
hat
off
with
his
left
hand
let
it
roll
upon
the
office
floor
made
a
dab
for
a
damp
pocket
handkerchief
in
his
right
pistol
pocket
and
stared
at
the
yellow
paper
again
whew
i
do
believe
it
he
muttered
then
aware
that
the
keen
eyes
of
the
messenger
boy
were
upon
him
as
if
sizing
him
up
for
news
he
stared
at
the
telegram
again
mumbled
it
a
fake
great
guns
and
rushed
from
the
room
the
messenger
boy
looked
after
the
editor
retreating
form
with
a
knowing
wink
as
if
the
whole
thing
had
been
a
special
job
put
up
by
himself
whistled
annie
rooney
took
up
a
tattered
copy
of
famous
quotations
laid
it
down
again
with
an
expression
of
mingled
respect
and
scepticism
characteristic
of
his
kind
and
then
swaggered
out
of
the
editorial
sanctum
well
swift
what
up
now
the
of
the
democratic
lifted
his
young
alert
face
from
the
evening
edition
of
his
own
journal
to
that
of
his
news
editor
interruptions
were
the
expected
thing
in
that
stirring
office
swift
did
not
speak
but
laid
the
telegram
upon
the
desk
pulled
out
a
victoria
regina
and
chewed
it
nervously
the
chief
read
the
message
through
once
to
himself
gave
one
glance
at
the
face
of
his
subordinate
and
then
said
this
is
a
repeat
is
it
not
yes
sir
first
news
came
three
hours
ago
i
did
believe
it
thought
it
a
fake
half
think
so
still
i
would
insert
it
and
wired
for
an
immediate
reply
here
it
is
it
is
too
late
for
the
five
edition
what
shall
i
do
well
this
extraordinary
conceded
the
chief
this
admission
meant
a
great
deal
in
that
office
deluged
with
news
from
all
parts
of
the
world
where
it
frequently
happened
that
fourteen
columns
of
purchased
and
paid
for
telegraphic
despatches
were
not
considered
important
enough
to
use
and
were
dropped
in
the
basket
the
chief
pressed
the
button
in
his
desk
and
asked
the
boy
that
appeared
to
inform
ticks
that
he
was
wanted
at
once
stalls
ticks
answered
the
summons
promptly
he
was
a
sallow
faded
man
dressed
in
a
sere
and
faded
prince
albert
coat
with
sallow
and
faded
boots
in
fact
the
whole
appearance
of
this
invaluable
member
of
the
corps
gave
one
the
impression
of
the
last
minute
of
autumn
when
even
the
trunks
of
the
trees
the
stones
of
the
hills
the
soil
of
the
valleys
look
sere
and
yellow
and
faded
and
ready
for
a
winter
sleep
ticks
looked
as
if
he
were
waiting
for
the
trance
that
never
overcame
him
i
wish
to
know
something
of
russell
the
capital
of
the
new
state
of
harrison
mr
ticks
ticks
pulled
out
a
yellow
faded
silk
bandanna
wiped
his
spectacles
sadly
and
with
an
tone
asked
yes
sir
mr
swift
looked
at
him
with
mingled
disgust
and
respect
and
tapped
his
foot
impatiently
on
the
bare
floor
let
me
see
it
is
situated
proceeded
the
chief
quietly
on
the
southeast
shore
of
the
great
gopher
lake
ticks
finished
the
sentence
mechanically
ah
i
remember
its
population
thousand
five
hundred
and
it
increases
at
the
rate
of
thirty
a
day
exactly
so
it
is
just
two
years
nine
months
and
twelve
days
old
to
be
sure
its
property
is
one
hundred
and
million
dollars
in
round
numbers
of
course
its
industries
are
the
usual
pertaining
to
western
cities
i
suppose
i
confess
ignorance
to
concrete
particulars
the
reports
have
been
singularly
deficient
in
this
respect
i
credit
this
entirely
to
its
youth
indeed
its
railroad
facilities
the
is
its
great
trunk
line
three
branch
lines
have
their
centre
there
just
built
two
roads
are
surveyed
to
shorten
the
distance
to
chicago
and
san
francisco
respectively
any
other
facts
of
interest
mr
ticks
ticks
hesitated
well
no
yes
no
in
fact
there
is
nothing
of
special
importance
that
i
that
is
different
from
any
other
city
except
nothing
sir
that
i
am
willing
to
stake
my
professional
reputation
upon
you
must
excuse
me
sir
is
it
in
the
cyclone
area
mr
ticks
no
sir
the
centre
of
barometric
depression
is
farther
north
the
buzzard
mountains
to
the
south
deflect
all
such
storm
centres
russell
will
be
singularly
free
from
tornadoes
the
looked
somewhat
nonplussed
and
handed
ticks
the
telegram
with
the
remark
what
do
you
think
of
that
i
do
not
know
sir
i
can
not
give
an
opinion
i
ticks
i
for
one
believe
this
is
true
i
i
stake
my
reputation
on
it
said
swift
decidedly
ticks
exasperating
caution
grated
on
the
news
editor
and
converted
his
scepticism
into
conviction
if
it
is
replied
his
chief
quietly
you
can
start
for
the
scene
on
the
six
thirty
express
you
did
up
the
charleston
earthquake
you
were
the
first
on
the
spot
at
johnstown
and
this
promises
to
be
as
bad
or
as
good
swift
tried
to
look
indifferent
at
this
cumulation
of
trust
he
had
been
on
the
paper
for
five
years
he
had
started
in
as
night
reporter
and
his
own
ability
and
quickness
united
with
a
certain
caution
one
might
call
it
a
news
integrity
had
raised
him
to
his
present
position
the
had
the
singular
reputation
of
printing
the
truth
it
rarely
was
taken
in
with
a
false
item
it
aspired
far
beyond
the
local
the
under
the
able
management
of
its
chief
and
of
swift
had
become
the
mirror
of
the
world
and
if
at
times
it
reflected
important
news
from
a
convex
surface
it
did
no
more
and
far
less
than
the
majority
of
its
contemporaries
who
had
no
telegraphic
facts
to
throw
away
daily
and
who
when
hard
pressed
to
it
manufactured
a
murder
at
home
or
a
war
rumor
abroad
to
help
pad
their
lean
columns
let
me
see
it
is
five
continued
the
chief
consulting
his
watch
i
will
not
detain
you
any
longer
ticks
we
shall
want
a
column
from
you
on
russell
and
now
swift
when
ticks
had
faded
out
of
the
room
who
this
correspondent
signed
it
dubbs
you
know
him
associated
press
man
and
special
correspondent
never
failed
me
he
the
only
one
there
who
knows
our
cipher
the
did
not
change
his
expression
but
his
eyes
had
the
steady
stern
look
that
showed
easy
determination
he
quickly
wrote
a
few
words
on
his
pad
and
handed
them
to
his
favorite
sub
take
this
to
the
cashier
get
to
the
elevated
as
fast
as
you
can
buy
what
you
need
when
you
get
time
and
i
depend
on
you
for
the
fullest
description
to
be
had
if
you
do
as
well
as
you
did
on
the
conemaugh
i
give
you
a
raise
on
your
return
good
luck
to
you
it
did
not
take
mr
swift
five
minutes
to
rush
to
his
den
slip
on
his
coat
snatch
his
hat
from
the
floor
run
downstairs
receive
a
fat
roll
of
bills
from
the
phlegmatic
cashier
and
bolt
for
the
elevated
train
in
minutes
he
was
at
the
central
station
with
two
minutes
to
spare
he
nodded
pleasantly
to
the
gatekeeper
and
boarded
the
train
as
nonchalantly
as
if
he
were
going
to
his
suburban
ii
all
of
our
readers
will
remember
the
curiosity
the
speculation
the
horror
the
apprehension
and
the
sympathy
universally
excited
when
on
the
tenth
of
september
it
was
learned
from
the
morning
papers
that
russell
the
new
capital
of
harrison
was
cut
off
from
all
communication
each
morning
sheet
hinted
darkly
at
the
cause
of
this
calamity
the
said
there
was
no
doubt
that
a
cyclone
of
gigantic
proportions
followed
by
a
had
swept
the
city
entirely
away
and
that
its
evening
edition
would
print
full
details
of
the
awful
visitation
with
pictures
by
their
special
artists
now
on
the
spot
illustrating
the
ruin
rut
there
was
one
piece
of
additional
news
about
russell
that
only
the
gave
let
us
quote
in
order
to
be
perfectly
accurate
the
sheet
is
before
us
as
we
write
extraordinary
calamity
russell
cut
off
from
all
communication
citizens
of
the
state
of
harrison
are
wild
with
apprehension
as
yet
we
can
not
speculate
on
the
nature
of
this
disaster
up
to
this
moment
no
one
knows
what
it
is
we
will
be
honest
and
say
we
know
no
more
than
our
neighbors
but
this
much
is
assured
not
only
is
communication
cut
off
within
a
radius
of
twenty
miles
of
the
city
but
it
is
impossible
to
it
at
present
there
are
forces
at
work
as
yet
uncatalogued
by
scientists
there
is
a
definite
circle
drawn
about
russell
and
to
cross
it
means
death
two
men
repairing
the
tracks
dropped
smitten
by
a
mysterious
and
invisible
hand
the
white
mile
post
announced
that
russell
was
twenty
miles
from
the
spot
where
the
corpses
of
these
brave
fellows
lay
what
baneful
miasma
envelops
this
broad
area
what
is
the
fate
of
the
thousands
within
its
borders
time
will
tell
our
reporters
are
on
the
spot
but
as
we
go
to
press
we
do
not
most
people
sniffed
at
this
dead
line
as
the
wildest
newspaper
canard
of
the
lot
many
shook
their
heads
while
those
who
had
relatives
or
friends
or
business
connections
in
russell
tried
to
drown
their
horrible
suspense
as
best
they
could
the
it
may
be
remembered
closed
its
leading
editorial
as
follows
are
a
democratic
paper
and
we
had
little
love
for
this
baby
state
and
its
upstart
capital
created
solely
to
guarantee
a
republican
majority
at
the
next
presidential
election
but
when
the
news
that
an
inscrutable
fate
had
overtaken
this
fraudulent
state
we
may
be
pardoned
for
saying
that
it
seems
to
us
a
sort
of
divine
retribution
for
political
jobbery
party
feeling
was
washed
away
in
that
common
compassion
that
all
christians
feel
for
their
enemies
in
who
could
mistake
the
diction
of
the
uncompromising
but
tender
chief
but
it
happened
this
time
as
so
often
before
that
the
information
was
true
again
that
enterprising
daily
had
made
its
scoop
on
the
other
papers
its
elation
was
pardonable
it
is
an
indisputable
fact
that
civilization
as
it
progresses
develops
in
its
advance
new
diseases
and
new
catastrophes
hay
fever
and
la
grippe
were
not
popular
a
hundred
years
ago
to
breed
a
cyclone
cut
down
your
trees
and
dry
up
your
water
supply
this
has
been
conscientiously
attended
to
and
the
natural
consequences
have
followed
science
can
eliminate
the
simooms
that
strike
bombay
and
calcutta
at
such
a
day
year
after
year
by
simply
flooding
the
desert
of
sahara
england
can
be
more
easily
conquered
by
deflecting
the
gulf
stream
a
quarter
of
a
point
than
by
a
thousand
ironclads
who
knows
but
that
it
would
be
less
expensive
to
change
her
into
a
glacier
than
to
bombard
her
with
guns
more
white
people
are
killed
by
railroad
accidents
yearly
in
our
highly
civilized
land
than
were
slaughtered
by
native
braves
in
the
palmy
days
of
the
last
of
the
mohicans
it
is
a
fact
that
our
boasted
civilization
instead
of
affording
surer
protection
murders
more
men
in
one
way
or
another
than
barbarism
only
in
the
present
case
the
victims
are
not
eaten
the
coffins
are
sumptuous
the
processions
decorous
the
mourners
in
good
form
the
burial
service
pregnant
with
hope
and
culture
is
not
shocked
with
us
murder
is
committed
by
corporations
not
by
paid
assassins
that
is
the
difference
the
assassin
fails
in
his
blows
once
in
a
while
the
corporation
never
but
where
was
russell
what
was
the
nature
of
the
calamity
the
impenetrable
fact
that
there
was
an
actual
invisible
dead
line
cast
about
that
territory
with
russell
as
its
centre
became
confirmed
with
every
report
it
will
be
recalled
that
all
the
railroad
tracks
entering
the
doomed
city
were
twisted
as
if
clawed
by
a
maddened
monster
it
presented
a
similar
appearance
to
the
south
carolina
railroad
on
the
day
of
the
charleston
earthquake
this
gave
rise
again
to
the
earthquake
theory
but
why
had
not
the
shock
been
felt
no
rumble
had
been
heard
could
an
earthquake
account
for
the
deadly
something
that
filled
the
air
no
intelligence
came
from
russell
the
way
must
be
forced
to
it
who
forgets
the
relief
expeditions
started
in
wagons
and
on
foot
from
every
point
of
the
compass
these
were
invariably
repelled
on
reaching
the
dead
line
we
could
understand
the
fetid
miasma
that
made
the
great
dismal
swamp
an
unknowable
country
we
could
comprehend
the
encroaching
dead
line
of
the
spreading
yellow
fever
bacillus
but
this
fearful
death
that
brooded
silently
impenetrably
mysteriously
and
occultly
over
a
vast
area
once
the
garden
of
civilization
baffled
all
attempts
at
explanation
even
birds
were
observed
to
vacate
this
tract
only
a
few
sinister
buzzards
wheeled
their
flight
with
straight
unflapping
wings
high
above
russell
almost
out
of
sight
as
if
they
were
the
embodied
ghosts
of
russell
unbaptized
inhabitants
what
was
that
implacable
power
reporters
and
trackmen
who
steadily
scoffed
at
it
were
themselves
attacked
with
violent
when
they
crossed
the
invisible
and
fatal
line
a
convulsion
of
all
the
members
followed
as
if
in
an
epileptic
fit
insensibility
and
generally
death
ensued
many
who
were
with
difficulty
rescued
and
who
finally
recovered
averred
that
they
experienced
an
overcoming
odor
acid
and
penetrating
such
as
is
peculiar
to
ozone
when
manufactured
in
a
chemical
laboratory
at
the
end
of
the
fourth
day
of
russell
complete
isolation
a
despair
settled
upon
the
country
england
was
staggered
by
the
uniqueness
of
these
phenomena
the
french
academy
of
sciences
after
a
prolonged
sitting
announced
that
they
could
suggest
no
solution
it
is
only
too
well
remembered
that
the
newspaper
bulletins
were
besieged
in
our
own
cities
but
these
offered
no
further
information
or
encouragement
was
advanced
civilization
responsible
for
this
disaster
or
not
that
was
the
burning
question
or
was
this
a
special
visitation
of
god
a
plague
new
to
the
medical
world
spontaneously
generated
sporadic
in
its
appearance
and
destined
forever
to
be
an
per
or
perhaps
to
spread
with
further
undetermined
horrors
thousands
were
now
on
the
ground
they
encompassed
that
section
about
as
joshua
did
the
city
of
jericho
as
the
settlers
did
the
territory
of
oklahoma
on
the
day
of
its
opening

a
house

a
murder
has
been
committed
on
the
evening
of
the
fourth
day

the
time
when
the

brought
the
first
despatch
to
the
office
of
the
its
chief
obviously
nervous
for
the
first
time
in
his
public

received

when
swift
boarded
the
western
express
he
walked
through
starting
from
the
last
car
to
see
if
any
rival
reporters
happened
to
be
there
for
the
same
purpose
he
scanned
the
backs
of
the
heads
of
the
passengers
first
and
then
looked
keenly
into
each
man
face
as
he
passed
he
had
in
common
with
all
newspaper
men
the
detective
instinct
who
knew
what
eminent
defaulter
or
renowned
cracksman
was
fleeing
the
city
in
dark
disguise
however
he
observed
no
familiar
or
suspicious
character
until
he
entered
the
smoking
car
he
did
not
go
through
for
although
a
great
smoker
he
took
no
pleasure
in
indulging
in
his
favorite
vice
in
the
air
of
a
democratic
smoking
car
what
fastidious
smoker
does
he
was
content
to
let
his
eyes
wander
up
and
down
the
aisle
he
was
about
to
turn
when
his
gaze
fell
upon
the
back
of
a
dingy
linen
duster
which
was
surmounted
by
a
large
faded
black
sombrero
the
man
under
these
garments
had
the
upper
part
of
his
face
hidden
beneath
the
broad
flap
of
his
hat
while
the
under
part
of
his
face
was
entirely
submerged
in
a
large
pamphlet
the
man
had
the
air
of
extreme
retirement
something
about
the
dinginess
of
the
felt
hat
seemed
familiar
to
swift
but
no
it
could
not
be
to
make
sure
the
new
editor
of
the
approached
and
bent
behind
the
man
the
gentleman
was
ignorant
of
the
attention
he
attracted
and
did
not
stir
he
seemed
to
be
engrossed
in
one
of
atkinson
incomprehensible
financial
reports
swift
caught
sight
of
the
travellers
face
started
back
in
amazement
and
said
excuse
me
sir
is
this
seat
engaged
and
without
further
ceremony
sat
down
beside
the
recondite
stranger
who
dropped
his
paper
and
stared
at
swift
in
return
great
cæsar
blurted
out
swift
how
the
d
epartment
did
you
come
here
on
the
five
elevated
replied
the
man
imperturbably
i
i
did
know
you
were
sent
too
swift
heart
burned
within
him
at
the
fancied
slight
i
was
answered
statis
ticks
laconically
and
wearily
where
the
dickens
are
you
going
then
asked
swift
warmly
to
russell
of
course
how
on
earth
did
you
get
off
i
did
young
man
i
skipped
this
exceptional
occasion
doubtless
accounted
for
the
only
bit
of
slang
that
was
ever
heard
to
fall
from
those
dry
lips
you
see
proceeded
ticks
drearily
the
circumstance
is
a
little
unusual
i
have
read
of
nothing
similar
in
the
casualty
reports
i
thought
it
best
for
my
reputation
to
make
my
own
personal
observations
and
figures
on
the
spot
but
your
position
asked
swift
in
surprise
statis
ticks
raised
his
head
proudly
if
the
can
get
on
without
me
let
it
but
your
family
continued
swift
somewhat
dazed
who
had
suspected
this
animated
reference
library
of
such
enterprise
i
sent
messenger
number
to
them
he
answered
with
a
sigh
as
if
he
were
bored
by
such
trifles
then
considering
this
topic
exhausted
ticks
took
out
his
notebook
and
looked
absently
out
of
the
window
now
and
then
he
jotted
down
a
few
abstruse
figures
he
was
engrossed
in
calculating
the
farm
acreage
adjacent
to
the
railroad
track
between
new
york
and
albany
when
they
drew
nearer
to
the
region
of
the
catastrophe
the
papers
gave
more
lurid
accounts
of
it
these
were
purchased
and
read
with
avidity
by
those
on
board
the
flying
express
groups
centred
in
the
cars
talked
only
of
one
thing
reporters
now
joined
the
train
at
each
prominent
city
as
the
train
approached
the
stricken
territory
it
became
crammed
to
suffocation
it
crept
at
a
funeral
pace
people
fought
at
each
station
for
seats
the
train
split
into
sections
on
account
of
the
added
cars
filled
with
mourners
with
rescuers
with
with
villains
swift
now
took
to
himself
a
certain
measure
of
authority
was
he
not
the
experienced
representative
of
the
greatest
daily
in
america
but
no
one
noticed
statis
ticks
who
silently
blinked
at
the
excited
crowds
and
then
jotted
down
his
estimates
of
them
on
the
afternoon
of
the
fourth
day
swift
bounded
from
the
front
platform
of
the
baggage
car
the
first
to
leave
the
train
and
looked
with
a
professional
eye
about
him
the
scene
that
met
his
quick
gaze
was
unprecedented
clamoring
gesticulating
shrieking
crying
men
and
women
were
rushing
here
and
there
in
frenzy
here
was
a
group
of
women
wailing
for
their
husbands
imprisoned
or
dead
and
who
knew
which
within
that
awful
circle
there
a
man
looked
vacantly
with
trembling
lips
from
group
to
group
hunting
for
the
wife
snatched
from
him
here
was
a
rude
fellow
peddling
half
a
bushel
of
potatoes
from
a
rickety
farm
wagon
there
a
woman
hungry
and
desperate
was
aimlessly
dragging
an
orphan
child
about
yonder
a
confidence
man
was
set
upon
and
beaten
by
infuriated
victims
in
the
midst
of
a
jostling
eager
credulous
mob
was
a
man
who
fancied
he
had
some
real
news
to
tell
now
and
then
as
if
by
mutual
consent
these
people
lifted
up
their
heads
towards
the
great
buzzard
mountains
toward
russell
the
city
of
their
despair
and
clenched
their
fists
and
uttered
an
exasperated
groan
agents
of
the
red
cross
society
and
of
the
law
and
order
league
had
already
erected
their
tents
and
were
doing
all
they
could
to
restrain
the
lawlessness
and
relieve
the
discomforts
of
the
mob
swift
critically
watched
these
seething
thousands
who
had
come
upon
the
spot
from
motives
of
sorrow
curiosity
gain
and
plunder
all
miserable
poorly
housed
and
scantily
fed
the
reporter
inquisitiveness
was
well
ahead
of
his
human
sympathy
up
to
this
point
within
these
few
days
the
border
line
about
the
afflicted
city
had
become
an
improvised
camp
that
extended
for
miles
and
miles
it
was
enforced
here
by
a
railroad
track
there
by
a
village
until
having
completed
the
gigantic
circle
it
met
again
thousands
were
flowing
in
each
hour
they
came
from
all
points
of
the
compass
like
flocks
of
angels
and
of
devils
as
yet
the
military
was
not
at
hand
and
the
little
law
that
existed
was
not
of
the
gospel
but
of
brute
force
and
adroitness
swift
having
sent
off
his
dispatch
at
the
improvised
office
and
having
forgotten
his
companion
whom
he
expected
to
be
a
nuisance
on
his
hands
retraced
his
steps
and
hurried
to
the
dead
line
where
it
impinged
on
the
railroad
track
here
was
the
centre
of
the
maddest
rush
here
men
groaned
and
cursed
and
wept
aloud
swift
pushed
his
way
through
until
he
reached
that
portion
of
the
track
that
defied
further
passage
a
cord
had
been
stretched
there
to
keep
the
crowds
back
upon
showing
his
badge
he
was
received
with
respect
take
keer
boss
said
the
huge
policeman
whose
sole
duty
up
to
this
time
had
been
to
drive
the
spikes
into
the
sleepers
i
tried
it
yesterday
they
just
pulled
me
out
i
got
the
d
d
shakes
yet
with
a
grave
smile
swift
ducked
under
the
rope
and
looked
before
him
the
solitary
motionless
blasted
prairie
stretched
out
relieved
only
by
the
outlines
of
the
buzzard
mountains
where
once
the
tops
of
towers
grain
elevators
and
steeples
were
to
be
seen
on
the
horizon
there
was
a
cloud
a
dense
strange
ominous
mist
overhung
the
stricken
city
this
cloud
was
of
a
yellowish
color
that
recalled
to
swift
the
dreadful
yellow
day
of
it
reached
nearly
to
the
summit
of
the
great
buzzard
mountain
within
five
miles
of
the
spot
on
which
he
stood
this
phenomenon
became
more
and
more
attenuated
until
it
disappeared
in
dull
transparency
what
did
that
cloud
contain
what
horrors
did
it
hide
of
what
was
its
nature
what
was
the
secret
of
its
deadly
influence
no
american
catastrophe
had
impressed
the
reporter
so
much
as
the
sight
of
this
veil
hiding
the
unattainable
city
curse
this
maledict
deadly
vapor
it
paralyzed
his
inventiveness
it
baffled
his
imagination
for
the
first
time
in
his
reportorial
career
swift
was
stunned
and
without
resource
now
it
was
said
that
not
a
breath
of
air
had
stirred
over
the
polluted
area
since
the
morning
of
the
loss
of
russell
as
the
news
editor
looked
down
the
tracks
he
saw
that
the
tracks
which
were
torn
up
and
twisted
beneath
him
within
a
hundred
feet
disappeared
utterly
from
view
the
wooden
ties
were
blackened
into
charcoal
in
their
places
but
the
iron
rails
had
evaporated
it
was
the
same
with
the
telegraph
wires
at
a
certain
point
they
stopped
and
were
gone
the
poles
tottering
and
scorched
and
bare
looked
like
a
procession
of
naked
ghosts
undressed
for
livelier
mockery
before
him
the
trees
the
shrubs
the
grain
the
grasses
in
fine
all
vegetation
had
been
smitten
unto
death
the
face
of
the
earth
was
black
and
crumbling
it
looked
as
if
the
roots
of
this
unconscious
vegetable
life
had
been
suddenly
touched
by
volcanic
fires
and
had
died
from
the
ground
up
there
was
not
a
vestige
of
life
as
far
as
the
eye
could
see
had
a
fire
swept
the
land
but
no
no
smoke
had
been
hitherto
visible
unless
this
inexplicable
cloud
were
smoke
and
yet
to
swift
practiced
eye
there
were
evidences
of
a
violent
a
sudden
a
consuming
heat
the
men
in
line
behind
swift
stood
respectfully
back
while
he
observed
this
unique
scene
he
noticed
a
white
close
at
hand
it
was
inscribed
russell
only
twenty
miles
to
russell
and
no
one
there
yet
what
a
field
for
the
news
editor
of
the
greatest
paper
in
the
land
the
competitors
were
keen
the
chances
were
even
the
honor
great
and
no
favors
asked
as
he
stood
for
a
moment
lost
in
thought
over
the
apparent
hopelessness
of
the
undertaking
and
almost
wishing
he
had
not
sent
so
confident
a
telegram
to
his
chief
he
felt
a
hand
upon
his
arm
i
have
found
one
said
a
slow
voice
have
you
what
asked
swift
with
careless
interest
he
recognized
the
aspirated
tones
of
ticks
i
have
calculated
this
thing
over
there
are
between
six
and
seven
thousand
on
the
spot
five
hundred
reporters
are
here
and
more
expected
by
every
train
there
is
no
food
no
bed
no
roof
for
us
here
this
place
has
been
completely
done
up
it
is
exhausted
to
get
facts
we
must
move
on
jove
you
right
old
man
ticks
acknowledged
the
compliment
with
a
slight
motion
of
his
hand
yes
i
have
just
purchased
the
only
team
to
be
had
for
four
hundred
dollars
swift
glanced
enviously
at
his
autumnal
colleague
who
had
already
outdone
him
in
enterprise
cyclones
and
tornadoes
in
this
part
of
the
country
proceeded
ticks
sententiously
travel
to
the
northeast
we
will
go
to
the
north
if
there
are
any
remains
they
are
to
be
found
there
ticks
had
it
would
seem
embraced
the
tornado
theory
we
will
go
immediately
exclaimed
swift
hold
cried
the
man
of
figures
quietly
i
wish
to
test
this
phenomenon
wait
for
me
here
before
swift
could
utter
a
protest
or
arrest
his
colleague
arm
the
philosopher
started
up
the
vacant
track
no
one
dared
to
follow
him
the
crowd
were
too
much
stunned
at
his
audacity
had
they
not
dragged
a
dozen
adventurers
back
from
the
same
mad
enterprise
men
shuddered
before
this
unknown
fate
that
stretched
out
its
relentless
arms
so
far
and
no
further
a
cocked
pistol
would
have
been
more
comfortable
but
ticks
walked
on
slowly
unconsciously
as
if
in
a
revery
he
put
his
hands
out
as
if
to
feel
the
air
he
put
his
tongue
out
as
if
to
taste
it
he
had
not
gone
forty
feet
when
he
was
observed
to
tremble
violently
those
on
the
dead
line
united
with
swift
in
shrieking
come
back
the
experimenting
member
of
the
staff
only
shook
his
head
he
was
not
twenty
yards
away
when
he
stopped
abruptly
he
put
his
hands
to
his
head
and
heart
and
struggled
against
the
unseen
force
it
beat
upon
him
but
he
steadied
his
legs
the
firmer
and
met
the
shock
it
smote
at
him
but
he
wearily
smiled
in
return
he
even
made
a
motion
as
if
for
his
notebook
but
such
temerity
was
too
much
for
the
occult
fluid
to
suffer
it
breathed
upon
him
and
felled
him
to
the
ground
as
he
dropped
he
rested
for
a
moment
spasmodically
upon
one
knee
and
peered
into
the
air
as
if
he
were
penetrating
the
secret
of
this
baleful
agent
then
he
fell
back
insensible
half
an
hour
afterwards
the
newspaper
man
came
to
swift
was
bending
over
him
we
rushed
you
out
you
pull
through
all
right
old
man
said
his
colleague
cheerily
did
you
note
the
symptoms
asked
ticks
feebly
yes
did
you
wire
them
no
i
had
time
i
then
do
so
he
sank
back
exhausted
but
how
did
you
feel
how
you
feel
asked
swift
anxiously
as
mortal
never
felt
before
replied
ticks
solemnly
with
these
words
upon
his
lips
he
lapsed
away
again
into
unconsciousness
that
evening
at
a
late
hour
swift
made
his
way
to
the
team
under
whose
protecting
shelter
he
had
ensconced
his
patient
with
such
poor
comfort
as
was
possible
ticks
raised
himself
from
the
cushions
upon
one
arm
are
you
ready
he
said
restlessly
for
what
asked
swift
in
astonishment
to
start
not
surely
yes
immediately
harness
up
we
must
be
at
the
extreme
north
of
this
unclassified
belt
by
morning
iv
empiria
the
new
county
seat
of
the
new
county
dominion
of
the
new
state
of
harrison
was
twenty
miles
away
to
the
northward
as
the
crow
flies
and
at
least
thirty
miles
off
by
road
the
horse
that
ticks
had
the
forethought
to
purchase
developed
an
unaccountable
spavin
united
with
an
unmistakable
case
of
the
heaves
when
the
whip
was
applied
it
furthermore
exhibited
an
innate
tendency
to
back
mr
swift
drove
through
the
darkness
of
the
night
picking
out
the
road
with
that
genius
for
locality
which
the
general
and
the
reporter
in
the
field
share
alike
barring
mistakes
accidents
or
further
exhibitions
of
depravity
on
the
part
of
the
equine
department
they
hoped
to
reach
empiria
by
dawn
ticks
leaned
back
upon
the
jolting
seat
in
unbroken
silence
when
his
colleague
who
drove
hazarded
a
question
the
only
reply
was
a
low
grunt
as
sleep
was
out
of
the
question
in
that
wagon
behind
that
horse
and
in
those
roads
was
it
pain
or
mighty
thought
or
nebulous
calculation
that
oppressed
the
wise
man
of
the
at
about
two
in
the
morning
stalls
ticks
broke
his
long
reserve
with
the
following
remark
if
it
is
it
is
a
unique
case
the
phenomenon
is
isolated
i
hope
you
feel
better
now
swift
had
been
anxious
about
his
colleague
and
had
interpreted
his
silence
as
evidence
of
physical
distress
ticks
gave
an
invisible
shrug
of
his
shoulders
to
express
the
contempt
he
felt
for
his
own
anatomy
in
comparison
with
the
attainment
of
exact
knowledge
otherwise
heedless
of
the
interruption
he
proceeded
it
is
physically
impossible
that
a
area
could
have
had
its
centre
three
or
four
hundred
miles
northwest
of
russell
indeed
replied
swift
vaguely
and
unsympathetically
it
must
travel
towards
the
centre
of
the
low
pressure
of
course
assented
swift
as
he
would
to
a
lunatic
evidently
that
inexpressible
shock
had
been
too
much
for
the
man
the
gopher
lake
on
the
north
and
the
buzzard
mountain
on
the
south
prevent
the
isothermal
curve
from
being
deflected
toward
the
north
really
said
swift
it
will
be
deflected
to
the
south
young
man
said
ticks
severely
the
atmospheric
equilibrium
can
suffer
no
centripetal
disturbance
well
what
then
asked
swift
a
little
bored
there
could
be
no
gyrating
motion
of
the
atmosphere
there
will
be
no
aerial
contest
there
could
be
no
colder
stratum
above
the
warmer
layer
coming
from
another
direction
both
would
flow
from
the
south
there
could
be
no
inversion
of
these
conditions
my
friend
russell
has
experienced
no
tornado
or
cyclone
and
yet
he
added
wistfully
and
thoughtfully
and
yet
well
if
there
was
no
tornado
what
the
deuce
are
we
going
to
empiria
for
demanded
swift
he
forgot
himself
and
gave
the
horse
a
sharp
cut
with
the
whip
in
consequence
of
which
the
animal
backed
them
so
nearly
toward
the
place
from
which
they
started
that
the
journey
to
empiria
was
seriously
lengthened
ticks
did
not
notice
this
and
yet
he
mused
what
is
the
matter
then
if
it
is
wind
asked
swift
impatiently
after
he
had
persuaded
his
horse
to
defer
the
next
attack
of
backing
for
a
mile
or
so
is
there
a
new
variety
of
atmospheric
disturbance
if
so
it
might
strike
us
here
sir
no
this
is
not
a
common
tornado
as
to
further
theories
they
are
not
formulated
as
yet
no
this
quadrant
of
the
state
of
harrison
was
not
subjected
to
such
a
violent
disturbance
i
am
prepared
to
say
that
there
will
be
no
evidences
of
a
vortex
wind
in
or
near
empiria
ticks
relapsed
into
further
thought
nor
could
he
be
aroused
until
the
jaded
horse
brought
the
two
jaded
reporters
into
the
open
square
of
the
county
seat
it
was
early
about
five
but
still
there
were
evidences
of
stirring
and
excitement
upon
the
village
common
two
or
three
large
tents
were
erected
and
from
out
of
these
scantily
dressed
men
and
woman
emerged
as
these
came
into
the
cool
open
air
they
lifted
up
their
faces
to
the
south
searching
the
horizon
and
sky
to
see
if
there
was
anything
new
in
the
smitten
district
it
was
a
motion
as
instinctive
as
that
of
the
mahomedan
toward
mecca
when
he
prays
the
appearance
of
our
two
strangers
excited
no
notice
empiria
was
on
a
branch
road
difficult
of
access
but
people
had
flocked
in
and
the
village
had
become
a
city
after
a
hard
struggle
in
which
persistent
ingenuity
won
swift
obtained
a
little
corn
for
his
horse
and
a
promise
of
breakfast
for
himself
and
companion
by
six
the
populace
was
awake
bustling
with
feverish
eagerness
and
oppressed
with
dread
and
suspense
swift
questioned
a
hundred
climbed
to
the
tops
of
trees
advanced
upon
the
mysterious
dead
line
and
retired
baffled
at
every
step
as
he
thought
of
that
vast
enclosure
that
was
now
an
unapproachable
cemetery
his
soul
shuddered
within
him
like
a
thousand
beside
him
this
man
of
nerve
was
baffled
and
overcome
by
nine
swift
had
exhausted
the
spot
and
was
for
pushing
on
to
the
westward
to
complete
the
perplexing
circle
if
necessary
perhaps
an
entrance
might
be
forced
elsewhere
he
was
sitting
in
his
buggy
with
ticks
who
was
as
uncommunicative
as
the
dasher
when
he
looked
for
the
hundredth
time
towards
the
buzzard
mountains
as
he
gazed
he
saw
turkey
buzzards
of
which
there
are
thousands
in
that
land
wheeling
their
spiral
flight
above
the
afflicted
territory
swift
looked
at
them
as
he
always
did
wondering
how
they
could
fly
so
long
without
flapping
their
wings
when
suddenly
he
cried
out
by
jove
i
have
it
this
startled
ticks
what
have
you
new
information
what
has
occurred
no
but
i
have
an
idea
idea
but
i
do
see
how
i
could
put
it
through
without
time
i
will
go
to
russell
or
over
russell
in
a
balloon
the
light
of
inspiration
and
sympathy
flashed
from
one
to
the
other
i
congratulate
you
on
the
thought
said
ticks
gravely
i
think
i
can
procure
you
one
in
a
quarter
of
an
hour
now
under
no
circumstances
is
a
balloon
an
easy
thing
to
obtain
even
in
a
metropolis
like
new
york
or
london
it
will
take
the
cleverest
reporter
at
least
eighteen
minutes
if
not
a
few
seconds
longer
to
hunt
up
a
suitable
means
of
ascension
it
is
not
as
simple
a
matter
as
one
may
suppose
to
go
up
therefore
when
ticks
in
a
voice
asserted
that
he
would
procure
the
balloon
in
fifteen
minutes
swift
fetched
a
long
low
whistle
but
not
in
the
least
disconcerted
by
swift
manner
ticks
slowly
descended
from
the
vehicle
and
said
just
wait
here
until
i
come
back
so
that
no
time
may
be
lost
he
strode
towards
one
of
the
large
tents
on
the
common
and
disappeared
within
its
flaps
had
ticks
the
formula
for
inflating
a
canvas
tent
into
a
balloon
who
knew
in
a
few
minutes
the
statistician
returned
bringing
with
him
a
tall
cadaverous
man
whose
leanness
was
heightened
by
a
long
chin
beard
which
descended
upon
his
chest
to
the
middle
button
of
his
coat
having
a
beard
of
this
description
the
gentleman
had
no
need
of
a
necktie
and
having
no
necktie
he
of
course
dispensed
with
a
collar
professor
ariel
my
friend
mr
swift
who
wishes
to
talk
business
ticks
performed
the
introduction
in
his
blandest
manner
the
man
who
seemed
to
see
nothing
had
seen
everything
it
had
taken
the
unpractical
the
scholar
the
dreamer
the
muser
to
observe
the
broken
remnants
of
a
county
fair
and
the
advertisement
of
that
aeronautic
expedition
conducted
by
the
renowned
professor
ariel
who
was
to
have
made
an
ascension
at
twelve
that
awful
day
taking
with
him
a
couple
to
be
married
in
the
seventh
heavens
and
a
baptist
clergyman
to
tie
the
knot
it
was
at
ten
in
the
morning
that
russell
was
closed
in
and
the
balloon
and
the
professor
had
been
ignominiously
forgotten
where
is
your
balloon
professor
asked
swift
when
he
had
learned
these
preliminary
details
darn
it
all
in
that
barn
there
the
professor
spoke
as
if
he
had
a
personal
grievance
against
the
barn
are
were
they
to
have
paid
you
for
your
ascension
five
hundred
dollars
and
i
hai
seen
a
red
and
i
ca
get
out
of
this
infernal
place
i
suppose
it
is
in
good
condition
inquired
the
editor
you
bet
it
new
never
been
used
cost
hundred
dollars
cash
how
long
would
it
take
you
to
get
her
ready
three
hours
pushing
would
do
it
i
suppose
we
want
to
go
up
in
that
balloon
professor
ariel
said
swift
after
deliberation
ticks
confirmed
this
demand
with
an
affirmative
gesture
of
his
sad
head
ca
be
done
sir
i
would
risk
her
in
this
crowd
the
professor
spoke
decisively
do
you
know
who
we
are
the
professor
shook
his
head
we
are
here
representing
the
and
it
will
be
the
biggest
advertisement
you
ever
had
the
professor
still
shook
his
head
doubtfully
if
you
were
the
president
and
all
his
angels
i
would
risk
it
a
might
carry
us
over
that
cussed
spot
and
we
all
be
stiff
before
you
could
say
jinks
nothing
daunted
swift
took
the
aeronaut
by
the
arm
offered
him
a
cigar
and
pointed
towards
the
buzzard
mountains
that
just
where
we
want
to
go
d
see
those
birds
up
there
if
they
can
stand
it
we
can
this
deadly
does
reach
as
high
as
that
the
professor
stared
and
then
muttered
to
himself
gee
mima
the
feller
hit
it
right
now
look
here
professor
you
a
famous
man
everybody
knows
the
charters

balloon
for
five
hundred
dollars
is
it
a
go
the
professor
eyes
glittered
yellow
the
color
of
greed
i
could
think
of
it
i
could
risk
the
danger
it
an
unknown
country
now
no
i
could
call
it
six
hundred
seven
that
would
pay
me
if
she
breaks
eight
hundred
dollars

do
it
nine
hundred
dollars
i

and
add
a
cipher
and
i
your
man

well
ticks

will
give
you
five
hundred
when
we
leave
the
ground
and
the
balance
when
we
touch
it
again
done
the
two
men
shook
hands
over
their
bargain
let
me
see
said
swift
glancing
at
his
watch
it
is
ten
we
will
ascend
at
one
i
will
assist
the
professor
in
preparing
his
airship
said
ticks
by
the
way
how
tall
is
your
balloon
professor
what
is
her
cognomen
i
call
her
mister
that
her
name
you
see
it
on
her
wait
till
she
gets
her
forty
thousand
cubic
feet
of
gas
in
her
and
you
see
her
height
by
twelve
the
multitude
had
got
wind
of
the
undertaking
and
were
thronging
towards
the
fenced
enclosure
where
the
huge
monster
was
flapping
with
that
inane
motion
that
only
a
balloon
can
take
to
itself
rumors
of
the
wildest
description
were
afloat
by
twelve
the
balloon
was
to
all
appearance
full
and
sandbags
were
being
put
aboard
by
one
the
crowd
could
hardly
be
kept
back
by
marshals
and
the
balloon
tugged
at
its
warps
as
if
it
would
burst
its
bonds
at
the
slightest
provocation
the
now
awakened
the
utmost
enthusiasm
men
came
by
tens
and
hundreds
to
make
offers
for
the
risky
trip
blank
it
all
she
chartered
the
is
was
the
aeronaut
invariable
reply
she
do
belong
to
me
this
trip
ask
the
owners
at
ten
minutes
after
one
precisely
swift
appeared
upon
the
ground
he
had
just
sent
off
the
following
message
to
his
paper
immediately
for
russell
by
thousand
dollar
he
had
sold
his
horse
and
team
and
had
purchased
provisions
with
the
proceeds
five
minutes
after
the
sale
the
horse
backed
into
the
hotel
and
smashed
the
buggy
into
chinese
swift
walked
calmly
to
the
car
and
ordered
the
provisions
aboard
have
you
a
long
ladder
and
grapnel
he
inquired
two
hundred
and
fifty
feet
each
anchor
two
hundred
pounds
are
you
ready
professor
asked
swift
satisfied
with
his
inspection
she
full
to
bustin
said
the
professor
looking
uneasily
at
the
straining
cable
jump
in
mr
ticks
the
crowd
was
almost
beside
itself
at
the
boldness
of
the
undertaking
men
yelled
and
hooted
encouragement
as
the
venerable
and
musty
editor
stepped
into
the
car
with
a
natural
air
it
took
more
than
this
to
embarrass
ticks
now
professor
as
swift
spoke
he
handed
the
professor
a
draft
on
the
for
five
hundred
dollars
the
professor
hesitated
no
longer
he
snatched
the
check
and
bounded
in
an
assistant
stood
ready
with
an
axe
to
cut
the
ropes
that
held
the
impatient
balloon
swift
then
stepped
in
leisurely
it
was
just
minutes
and
a
quarter
past
one
the
crowd
shrieked
as
if
their
throats
would
burst
swift
lifted
his
hat
in
acknowledgment
good
luck
never
say
die
come
back
and
tell
us
all
about
it
if
you
see
my
husband
tell
him
i
waiting
for
him
they
cheered
and
yelled
and
cried
and
cheered
again
are
you
ready
asked
swift
looking
at
his
companions
then
let
her
go
a
cut
a
swirl
an
indescribable
motion
and
shouts
became
to
those
in
the
whispers
men
became
ants
and
they
were
gone
look
for
god
sake
look
what
is
it
swift
strained
his
eyes
to
the
southward
toward
the
territory
the
malignant
cloud
that
settled
over
plain
and
mountain
slope
was
broken
on
the
gopher
lake
as
soon
as
swift
had
recovered
from
the
first
bound
of
the
balloon
he
had
scanned
the
dark
mist
and
by
the
borders
of
the
lake
he
had
found
a
rift
this
rift
indicated
the
spot
where
the
city
of
russell
should
have
been
as
he
spoke
he
clutched
the
arm
of
his
colleague
and
pointed
over
the
side
of
the
rising
car
i
i
afraid
i
ca
see
what
you
mean
stammered
statis
ticks
my
glasses
are
blurred
the
man
of
figures
was
really
agitated
but
professor
ariel
like
many
an
adventurer
had
more
than
his
share
of
what
one
may
politely
call
but
what
is
known
in
common
north
american
as
simple
cheek
besides
in
some
sections
of
the
country
he
might
have
been
called
a
profane
man
with
his
hands
on
the
safety
valve
he
looked
and
then
ejaculated
by
it
gone
i
see
nothing
nothing
but
black
streaks
said
the
elder
member
of
the
corps
hurriedly
ca
we
stop
professor
perhaps
that
the
site
of
the
unfortunate
city
the
professor
obedient
to
the
suggestion
pulled
the
safety
valve
and
the
gas
rushed
out
with
a
wheeze
you
bet
it
is
that
the
place
did
i
land
there
before
i
struck
empiria
darned
lucky
for
me
they
did
take
stock
in
the
i
might
have
been
god
knows
what
now
even
as
the
three
men
looked
the
cloud
closed
in
upon
the
land
strangely
enough
it
shunned
the
surface
of
the
water
the
travellers
cast
their
eyes
upon
the
sullen
bosom
of
the
gopher
lake
this
body
of
water
glittered
like
the
scales
of
a
leaden
serpent
it
looked
from
that
great
height
poisonous
and
discontented
swift
gazed
upon
it
intently
why
would
they
have
you
inquired
ticks
of
the
professor
see
have
we
struck
another
current
as
he
spoke
the
huge
swayed
a
breath
of
chilly
air
smote
them
then
gently
the
balloon
swung
toward
the
gopher
lake
toward
the
fateful
city
well
you
see
the
balloon
was
too
for
them
answered
the
professor
still
bent
upon
his
grievance
now
if
it
had
gone
by
electricity
that
been
another
thing
how
so
asked
ticks
with
polite
interest
well
everything
in
that
town
went
by
electricity
they
had
electric
cars
electric
lights
electric
shampooing
electric
cigars
electric
sewing
machines
electric
elevators
electric
table
service
in
the
hotel
worst
was
they
had
electric
cabs
they
kept
quiet
about
some
of
their
notions
folks
did
say
they
had
their
reasons
i
did
hear
nothing
about
all
this
electric
tomfoolery
till
i
struck
the
city
ah
interrupted
ticks
pricking
up
his
ears
i
have
heard
about
those
cabs
but
i
have
had
no
reliable
information
that
they
were
a
success
they
ai
answered
the
professor
rubbing
his
right
arm
with
a
wince
of
memory
like
a
darn
jack
i
took
one
for
a
spin
they
go
on
three
wheels
one
in
front
two
behind
the
driver
he
sits
in
front
and
steers
the
shebang
with
the
forward
wheel
i
had
gone
two
blocks
when
i
leaned
out
of
the
window
and
the
current
struck
me
in
the
arm
like
a
shot
you
bet
i
yelled
bloody
murder
and
got
out
of
that
trap
in
two
shakes
of
a
colt
tail
how
does
all
that
electrical
system
work
otherwise
asked
ticks
slowly
after
some
thought
everybody
perfectly
wild
over
it
they
wo
allow
a
horse
in
town
nor
even
a
ton
of
coal
electricity
is
the
big
thing
of
the
future
they
fight
electrical
duels
feller
that
stands
the
greatest
number
of
alternating
volts
gets
the
apology
i
saw
a
in
the
street
stopped
by
the
humane
society
a
man
would
drop
a
wet
sponge
on
the
dog
head
another
on
his
back
and
turn
on
the
circuit
they
generally
both
dropped
and
never
knew
what
struck
two
dead
dogs
better
than
one
fight
but
they
kept
it
all
dark
enough
these
were
jest
experiments
they
said
when
they
were
done
that
they
were
going
to
have
an
electrical
exhibition
and
invite
the
hull
world
why
i
heard
they
were
fool
enough
to
put
in
a
bill
in
the
legislature
to
have
the
name
of
russell
changed
to
electra
as
if
russell
was
good
enough
for
them
ticks
mused
over
these
facts
why
was
it
that
his
acquisitive
mind
had
not
roamed
over
this
field
before
perhaps
because
it
was
acquisitive
not
imaginative
could
only
account
for
the
unpardonable
omission
on
the
ground
that
there
were
so
many
new
competing
western
cities
each
with
its
peculiar
advantages
and
that
there
were
so
many
strange
electrical
inventions
new
each
day
that
he
had
overlooked
russell
and
its
progressive
hobby
besides
was
he
not
on
the
staff
of
a
democratic
paper
which
would
perhaps
on
the
whole
prefer
to
ignore
the
new
republican
state
and
its
flourishing
capital
how
was
all
this
power
produced
if
coal
was
excluded
asked
ticks
oh
windmills
did
that
a
half
a
dozen
huge
windmills
with
wings
each
as
big
as
the
were
the
first
things
you
saw
they
were
nearly
three
hundred
feet
high
good
heavens
look
man
look
down
there
do
you
see
something
in
the
middle
of
the
lake
swift
pulled
the
professor
over
to
his
side
of
the
car
and
pointed
directly
below
the
balloon
they
had
now
struck
a
dead
calm
and
the
floated
motionless
two
thousand
feet
above
the
lake
directly
below
them
was
something
resting
upon
the
waters
it
looked
fixed
and
dead
a
log
a
wreck
a
raft
slowly
the
outline
took
to
itself
the
form
of
a
boat
have
you
a
pair
of
glasses
here
asked
swift
all
of
a
quiver
the
professor
shoved
one
of
steward
in
his
hand
there
a
body
in
that
boat
cried
swift
after
a
prolonged
examination
no
great
god
it
alive
it
moves
it
a
the
professor
took
a
long
look
i
guess
you
right
she
a
female
but
she
must
be
saved
insisted
swift
we
must
save
her
yes
professor
ariel
said
statis
ticks
sententiously
and
with
trembling
dignity
being
a
woman
she
demands
our
attention
and
besides
as
a
survivor
she
can
give
us
the
information
and
suggest
the
figures
we
need
i
do
my
best
gentlemen
said
the
professor
shaking
his
head
but
it
mighty
ticklish
business
supposing
we
drift
into
the
deadly
air
i
do
know
what
that
vapor
means
but
it
evidently
means
the
by
and
by
even
the
would
save
us
then
look
here
professor
jerked
out
swift
peremptorily
it
got
to
be
done
now
dry
up
all
right
it
a
go
i
can
stand
it
if
you
can
so
the
valve
was
opened
cautiously
and
the
balloon
with
majestic
slowness
obedient
to
its
master
hand
descended
toward
the
great
gopher
lake
and
hovered
over
the
upon
its
malignant
bosom
as
the
approached
the
little
boat
ticks
looked
at
it
eagerly
she
alive
and
unmarried
said
the
oracle
slowly
why
unmarried
asked
swift
with
a
vague
flutter
of
the
heart
he
had
watched
the
figure
of
the
woman
attentively
with
the
spyglass
it
was
rounded
and
supple
masses
of
hair
hid
her
shoulders
and
face
because
answered
ticks
she
is
under
eighteen
the
statistics
of
this
section
of
the
west
show
that
no
female
over
eighteen
years
of
age
remains
single
the
balloon
had
now
descended
to
within
three
hundred
feet
of
the
boat
the
girl
in
it
did
not
stir
she
lay
with
her
head
propped
in
the
bow
so
stiffly
and
so
still
that
to
all
appearance
she
was
a
dead
woman
but
the
three
men
agreed
they
had
seen
her
move
had
her
rescuers
arrived
too
late
let
down
the
ladder
cried
swift
i
go
down
and
pick
her
up
ignorant
how
hard
it
is
even
for
an
experienced
hand
to
climb
up
and
down
a
rope
ladder
swinging
in
space
he
clambered
over
the
side
of
the
car
hold
young
fellow
professor
ariel
spoke
sharply
by
this
time
they
were
within
two
hundred
feet
of
the
water
hold
i
say
yelled
the
professor
in
a
rage
letting
go
the
rope
to
the
and
at
the
same
time
grabbing
a
if
you
stir
out
of
this
car
i
pitch
ballast
out
and
you
never
see
your
gal
again
swift
stopped
short
the
swayed
like
a
double
snake
beneath
them
its
end
was
fifty
feet
above
the
boat
but
o
horrors
it
was
also
nearly
fifty
feet
to
one
side
of
the
boat
no
human
power
could
reach
the
lady
from
the
ladder
a
breath
might
blow
the
even
farther
away
at
the
same
time
the
girl
doubtless
aroused
from
her
stupor
by
the
professor
loud
call
opened
her
eyes
slowly
above
her
loomed
a
gigantic
monster
was
it
a
dream
was
this
apparition
a
final
terror
added
to
her
awful
experience
sent
to
crush
out
the
last
remnant
of
her
buoyant
life
and
magnificent
courage
she
stared
at
the
thing
above
her
then
opened
her
mouth
and
gave
a
scream
such
as
can
only
be
the
result
of
full
western
tracheal
development
oh
do
be
frightened
cried
swift
quickly
do
we
come
to
save
you
he
could
not
think
of
anything
more
to
say
and
it
occurred
to
him
that
he
was
a
donkey
to
say
anything
but
the
professor
who
had
few
delicate
scruples
waved
his
hat
and
shouted
what
the
matter
with
the
she
all
right
this
yell
so
frequently
heard
on
eastern
land
and
sea
had
penetrated
even
to
the
great
gopher
lake
and
it
reassured
the
girl
more
than
anything
else
could
have
done
she
sat
up
weakly
enough
in
the
boat
and
after
waving
her
hand
with
feminine
instinct
tried
to
coil
her
hair
and
otherwise
prepare
herself
as
best
she
could
to
receive
these
angels
from
the
clouds
can
you
catch
yelled
the
professor
try
me
came
back
a
voice
undaunted
though
enfeebled
by
long
suffering
the
professor
coiled
a
stout
light
rope
on
his
arm
shot
out
a
few
thundering
orders
about
and
ballast
and
cautiously
but
with
gymnastic
quickness
descended
the
yielding
rounds
of
the
long
ladder
to
the
lady
in
the
boat
to
the
passengers
in
the
car
it
seemed
hours
before
the
professor
reached
the
last
of
the
two
hundred
rounds
it
might
have
been
forty
seconds
swift
called
out
to
the
young
lady
encouragingly
hold
out
a
little
while
longer
and
you
be
safe
i
all
right
now
since
you
have
come
the
young
woman
trembling
voice
seemed
to
lay
an
actual
emphasis
on
you
that
swift
was
selfish
enough
to
take
to
himself
how
long
have
you
been
there
five
days
i
am
nearly
dead
poor
poor
thing
said
swift
to
himself
tears
of
sympathy
came
into
his
eyes
even
ticks
blinked
she
office
editor
on
some
russell
daily
said
ticks
after
another
long
look
through
the
field
glasses
how
do
you
know
asked
swift
in
displeasure
she
got
a
stylograph
behind
her
right
ear
and
a
yellow
pad
in
her
lap
besides
there
are
some
clippings
at
the
bottom
of
the
boat
by
this
time
professor
ariel
had
reached
the
lower
end
of
his
ladder
now
catch
he
cried
hurling
the
light
rope
with
sure
skill
it
whistled
through
the
air
and
the
end
fell
across
the
boat
make
fast
to
something
quick
now
as
he
spoke
he
felt
a
breath
of
air
upon
his
face
the
balloon
careened
over
slightly
and
righted
itself
the
was
slowly
settling
to
the
water
surface
as
quickly
as
he
could
the
professor
pulled
the
boat
toward
him
you
ca
it
anchored
cried
the
girl
she
tugged
at
the
rope
with
the
last
strength
of
hope
and
actually
brought
it
up
the
skiff
yielded
to
the
professor
clutch
by
this
time
the
balloon
was
so
low
down
that
the
aeronaut
feet
were
nearly
in
the
water
throw
out
sand
by
the
handful
he
ordered
this
gentle
lighting
kept
her
at
the
right
elevation
now
the
professor
touched
the
boat
he
jumped
in
do
talk
he
cried
hold
out
your
arms
instead
he
knotted
the
rope
underneath
her
arms
and
tied
the
other
end
firmly
to
the
ladder
we
got
to
hurry
now
miss
you
keep
cool
and
we
save
you
all
right
it
was
a
desperate
chance
now
let
go
a
couple
of
sandbags
the
order
came
up
to
swift
in
the
car
statis
ticks
with
his
hand
upon
the
and
hearing
the
order
became
for
the
first
time
in
his
life
confused
he
pulled
the
wide
open
and
the
gas
rushed
furiously
out
even
with
the
two
sandbags
overboard
and
lightened
of
fifty
pounds
dead
weight
the
balloon
descended
suddenly
the
professor
saw
the
mistake
at
a
glance
he
yelled
furiously
good
god
close
that
valve
or
we
lost
but
the
mischief
was
already
done
heave
it
all
out
shrieked
the
professor
climbing
up
the
ladder
like
a
cat
the
car
of
the
balloon
grazed
the
side
of
the
boat
statis
ticks
in
such
atonement
as
he
could
make
for
his
awful
error
reached
over
his
thin
arms
the
girl
arose
tottering
to
her
feet
and
with
a
mighty
effort
the
gray
gaunt
man
lifted
the
heavy
girl
into
the
car
that
was
the
most
humane
and
at
the
same
time
the
maddest
thing
he
could
have
done
under
the
influence
of
the
added
weight
the
car
struck
the
boat
it
and
then
dragged
in
the
water
out
with
everything
howled
the
professor
the
three
looked
around
in
despair
the
girl
had
dropped
limp
upon
the
floor
and
the
water
was
upon
her
above
them
was
a
cloud
of
the
darkness
of
night
cirrhus
clouds
scudded
here
and
there
in
confusion
there
was
strange
atmospheric
howling
in
the
distance
approaching
nearer
and
nearer
the
water
assumed
that
angry
hue
it
takes
to
itself
before
a
desperate
storm
the
monstrous
balloon
writhed
intelligently
above
them
all
the
sandbags
were
now
pitched
out
the
shook
itself
loose
from
the
water
it
rose
it
fell
it
rose
again
are
we
safe
cried
swift
looking
anxiously
at
the
girl
take
off
your
coat
and
vest
and
shoes
everything
and
chuck
over
like
lightning
and
we
see
answered
the
professor
solemnly
vi
with
wild
energy
the
men
threw
out
of
the
car
everything
that
had
a
semblance
of
weight
aeronauts
well
know
the
difference
that
a
few
ounces
make
to
safety
when
the
gas
has
been
exhausted
from
their
balloon
professor
ariel
had
cast
everything
overboard
with
maniacal
celerity
and
now
clad
only
in
his
undershirt
and
trousers
was
hacking
at
the
trailing
ladder
to
cut
that
off
the
balloon
had
risen
some
fifty
or
a
hundred
feet
it
now
halted
irresolute
could
it
recover
itself
and
mount
or
would
it
lose
courage
and
fall
dragging
its
passengers
to
a
certain
death
but
far
more
fearful
than
the
latter
imminent
danger
was
the
sight
of
the
threatening
sky
not
one
of
these
imperilled
people
had
ever
seen
such
whirling
masses
of
mad
black
revengeful
clouds
these
centred
from
all
sides
upon
the
site
of
the
lost
city
they
rushed
together
and
formed
eddies
and
funnels
they
roared
like
live
things
it
was
in
one
of
these
smaller
whirlwinds
that
the
balloon
was
caught
the
massive
folds
of
silk
beat
and
writhed
and
tried
to
tear
themselves
loose
from
the
clutches
of
the
elements
the
four
in
the
car
clung
to
it
with
terror
watching
the
play
of
the
wind
it
no
use
i
ca
cried
the
professor
with
damp
white
face
throwing
down
his
knife
the
wire
is
too
strong
we
must
get
to
the
rigging
cut
off
the
car
and
god
help
us
the
situation
was
indeed
appalling
the
ladder
for
purposes
of
greater
stability
was
made
of
wire
woven
over
with
manila
the
sharp
knife
could
not
cut
that
useless
weight
in
this
crisis
the
young
lady
recovered
her
equipoise
she
began
to
take
off
her
shoes
it
will
help
a
little
she
said
then
she
began
shyly
to
loose
her
overskirt
but
the
whirlwind
caught
the
car
and
nearly
upset
it
it
swirled
and
almost
touched
the
ground
up
cried
the
professor
he
caught
the
girl
and
tied
her
in
dexterously
every
man
held
himself
in
the
ropes
that
bound
the
car
to
the
balloon
as
best
he
might
it
was
a
fearful
chance
the
professor
cut
a
rope
and
made
bowline
chairs
each
sat
in
his
noose
and
held
on
for
dear
life
the
professor
who
never
lost
his
coolness
worked
as
if
he
had
done
this
before
and
indeed
he
had
swift
had
the
presence
of
mind
or
the
presence
of
heart
to
support
the
young
lady
in
this
perilous
moment
cut
cut
the
car
had
been
caught
in
a
counter
eddy
and
was
five
hundred
feet
or
so
in
the
air
but
rapidly
descending
then
the
last
strand
parted
relieved
of
several
the
balloon
bounded
up
it
was
buffeted
and
whirled
and
tossed
from
cloud
to
cloud
the
maddened
elements
clutched
at
it
balls
of
fire
danced
upon
the
ground
beneath
and
darted
here
and
there
from
cloud
to
cloud
as
the
professor
gave
the
last
cut
and
the
balloon
soared
aloft
there
was
a
report
as
if
a
thousand
rounds
of
artillery
were
concentrated
in
one
shot
there
was
a
dazzling
streak
of
light
it
smote
the
adventurers
blind
it
smote
them
deaf
it
stunned
them
into
insensibility
like
limp
corpses
the
four
sat
as
they
were
whirled
on
high
each
clasping
his
arms
instinctively
about
the
rope
that
held
him
it
seemed
as
if
death
had
overtaken
them
all
and
petrified
them
with
its
touch
i
have
solved
the
problem
ticks
opened
his
eyes
and
gasped
by
my
faith
where
are
we
far
below
were
opaque
blackness
storm
and
wind
above
the
blue
infinite
ether
the
sun
shone
brilliantly
it
warmed
the
balloon
it
expanded
the
gas
the
kept
rising
the
stillness
was
a
miracle
beneath
stretched
the
panorama
of
a
stricken
country
the
highest
peaks
of
the
buzzard
mountains
were
below
the
balloon
the
storm
raged
over
the
lake
and
the
lost
city
like
a
mock
storm
it
was
so
distant
and
so
unimportant
now
and
then
there
was
a
flash
of
yellow
light
and
a
distant
reverberation
the
storm
was
fearful
but
it
was
only
a
small
blot
upon
a
fair
landscape
when
viewed
from
such
a
height
yes
mused
ticks
aloud
pulling
his
energies
together
i
know
now
what
it
all
means
i
know
the
secret
of
russell
unparalleled
disaster
as
he
spoke
he
reached
out
and
shook
the
professor
then
swift
then
he
touched
the
young
lady
with
gentle
deference
the
three
opened
their
eyes
one
after
another
we
saved
oh
what
luck
we
saved
cried
professor
ariel
tears
of
joy
started
from
his
eyes
say
mister
his
manner
returning
to
him
in
the
fulness
of
his
ecstasy
say
punching
swift
you
ai
got
a
chaw
about
you
have
you
but
swift
lifting
up
his
bewildered
eyes
took
in
the
glorious
blue
sky
and
sun
then
his
gaze
fell
upon
the
horror
from
which
they
had
escaped
mechanically
he
searched
the
pockets
of
his
trousers
out
of
his
pistol
pocket
he
pulled
a
flask
of
brandy
all
that
survived
to
him
of
his
outfit
for
this
ghastly
journey
this
he
had
forgotten
otherwise
it
would
have
gone
by
the
rail
along
with
his
pocketbook
to
lighten
the
car
not
yet
he
said
pushing
aside
the
professor
longing
hand
the
lady
first
the
brandy
the
warm
sun
and
the
prospect
of
safety
roused
the
girl
considerably
possibly
swifts
supporting
arm
hastened
her
recuperation
swift
passed
the
bottle
to
ticks
who
drank
and
coughed
and
drank
again
it
croix
vintage
of
said
ticks
gratefully
the
professor
got
what
he
could
but
swift
would
not
touch
any
he
was
experiencing
a
finer
intoxication
his
eyes
met
those
of
the
girl
who
had
been
the
unconscious
cause
of
all
their
danger
she
seemed
to
perceive
this
for
she
soon
broke
the
profound
silence
by
suggesting
with
a
blush
you
need
hold
me
so
tight
sir
i
try
not
to
fall
can
you
talk
now
asked
ticks
of
their
lady
companion
this
question
deflected
a
possible
embarrassment
but
swift
deeming
it
safe
to
allow
no
risk
did
not
relax
his
hold
of
the
girl
are
you
a
reporter
he
asked
with
an
unaccountable
desire
to
keep
the
conversation
in
his
own
hands
this
gentleman
and
myself
are
on
the
the
other
man
is
professor
of
the
balloon
how
did
you
know
she
answered
with
a
first
approach
to
a
smile
i
am
or
at
least
i
was
society
reporter
on
the
the
last
word
started
ticks
up
again
you
witnessed
the
destruction
of
russell
do
you
know
that
its
cause
is
the
despair
of
the
world
do
you
know
oh
it
was
dreadful
dreadful
dreadful
interrupted
the
girl
with
a
shudder
i
was
out
in
my
boat
alone
and
saw
it
all
the
lady
hid
her
face
i
was
so
tired
that
morning
i
could
breathe
it
was
oppressive
the
air
was
so
strangely
you
touched
an
iron
post
and
a
spark
shot
out
and
gave
you
a
shock
i
could
stay
so
i
begged
off
and
took
my
lunch
and
my
work
in
my
little
skiff
and
rowed
two
miles
out
and
anchored
and
tried
to
write
can
you
state
for
the
miss
insula
magnet
that
my
name
sir
miss
magnet
can
you
state
at
what
exact
hour
the
catastrophe
occurred
the
balloon
had
now
come
to
a
standstill
and
floated
quietly
above
the
lake
and
the
doomed
city
the
four
wriggled
uncomfortably
in
the
improvised
seats
the
ropes
cut
them
the
sun
beat
upon
them
hotly
they
were
exhausted
and
hungry
and
parched
ca
we
go
down
suggested
swift
his
brain
reeled
at
the
great
depth
below
him
the
person
who
lost
his

he
reached
the
earth
the
first
stage
in
the
strasburg
cathedral
is
two
hundred
and
fifty
feet
high
and
it
is
a
terrible
sight
to
look
over
its
stone
balustrade
no
one
forgets
his
sensation
when
he
leans
over
the
top
of
the
eiffel
tower
a
thousand
feet
from
the
asphalt
pavement
below
judge
what
it
was
to
those
inexperienced
travellers
to
be
over
ten
thousand
feet
high
clinging
like
flies
to
these
straining
ropes
no
i
would
descend
yet
in
this
calm
for
as
many
dollars
as
we
are
feet
high
we
safe
enough
here
look
up
man
look
up
shut
your
eyes
that
best
but
ticks
pugnaciously
returned
to
his
question
what
was
a
little
matter
of
falling
ten
thousand
feet
or
so
a
fact
startling
and
valuable
was
at
stake
and
at
hand
it
was
just
a
quarter
of
ten
answered
miss
magnet
in
a
low
tone
i
was
writing
suddenly
a
bitter
vapor
enveloped
everything
there
was
no
wind
no
sun
no
clouds
only
this
dense
strange
atmosphere
it
prostrated
me
there
were
a
number
of
boats
near
me
these
were
all
of
the
new
patent
they
were
steel
i
saw
great
balls
of
fire
dance
from
boat
to
boat
then
there
came
from
the
city
a
light
such
as
i
never
saw
before
it
flashed
like
an
enormous
meteor
like
an
incandescent
flame
it
enveloped
russell
i
was
scorched
even
where
i
was
by
the
flash
i
heard
a
hissing
sound
like
water
on
melted
iron
and
then
and
then
persisted
ticks
in
a
kind
of
rapture
and
then
i
must
have
fainted
away
when
i
came
to
there
was
no
city
only
masses
of
blackness
and
and
oh
the
boats
the
people
they
were
all
gone
not
capsized
not
drowning
but
gone
there
were
no
boats
there
were
no
people
there
was
even
a
dead
body
to
keep
me
company
i
only
i
was
left
living
and
alone
upon
the
hissing
water
when
i
was
able
i
rowed
back
the
shore
looked
horrible
and
ridged
as
if
molten
lead
had
been
poured
into
it
when
i
came
nearer
an
awful
heat
and
a
deadly
odor
overcame
me
i
had
barely
strength
to
row
back
and
anchor
again
then
the
mist
settled
everywhere
except
where
i
was
the
girl
stopped
for
a
moment
breathless
i
could
see
anything
it
was
hot
and
then
it
was
cold
i
tried
to
eat
my
luncheon
i
tried
to
get
some
sleep
i
called
and
called
for
help
i
could
tell
night
from
day
i
ca
say
whether
it
was
four
or
five
days
i
said
five
i
must
have
been
faint
a
good
deal
the
worst
thing
was
being
alone
i
expected
to
die
i
got
pretty
weak
then
i
saw
the
balloon
the
girl
bowed
the
face
which
she
could
not
hide
and
sobbed
at
her
own
dreadful
story
swift
was
greatly
moved
miss
magnet
he
said
gently
putting
her
head
upon
his
shoulder
i
think
you
had
better
rest
you
are
tired
out
this
is
different
you
know
you
need
when
you
get
safely
down
the
girl
gave
him
a
grateful
glance
and
obeyed
him
quietly
how
did
she
escape
soliloquized
ticks
loud
enough
to
be
overheard
oh
i
do
know
do
ask
me
unless
it
was
that
i
was
in
a
wooden
boat
all
the
rest
on
the
lake
go
by
storage
battery
and
are
made
of
steel
mine
is
the
only
boat
but
i
was
always
afraid
everybody
laughed
at
me
but
i
did
what
i
do
at
home
i
cut
off
the
legs
of
a
chair
and
fixed
them
in
glass
tumblers
i
always
sit
in
my
office
on
glass
tumblers
my
bed
rests
on
glass
tumblers
too
it
a
you
know
i
used
to
get
shocked
every
day
everybody
got
shocked
in
russell
but
they
pretended
not
to
mind
it
but
miss
magnet
do
you
know
what
is
the
cause
of
russell
fate
of
this
deadly
atmosphere
beneath
us
unless
of
course
that
ca
be
i
guess
it
a
visitation
of
providence
but
i
do
know
for
what
the
girl
stopped
awed
at
the
thoughts
she
had
evoked
a
visitation
of
providence
repeated
ticks
slowly
yes
she
is
right
the
sin
of
presumptuousness
was
visited
upon
that
unhappy
place
do
you
mean
to
say
swift
started
up
somehow
he
had
forgotten
russell
its
mysterious
fate
his
mission
everything
but
the
girl
he
had
awaked
to
his
duty
do
you
mean
to
say
that
the
whole
thing
is
due
to
e
hold
on
look
below
interrupted
the
professor
they
clung
to
the
ropes
and
glued
their
gaze
upon
the
sight
so
far
beneath
them
the
storm
had
magically
cleared
away
the
sunlight
now
pierced
the
whole
landscape
for
the
first
time
since
the
disaster
the
lost
city
in
black
shapeless
ruins
lay
directly
beneath
them
we
will
go
down
the
professor
opened
the
cautiously
the
devil
has
been
chased
away
by
the
storm
he
said
emphatically
indeed
the
baleful
vapor
had
gone
as
they
swiftly
descended
strange
sights
met
their
eyes
they
could
still
see
everything
microscopically
for
a
radius
of
twenty
miles
around
black
specks
were
rushing
up
the
stricken
railroad
tracks
along
the
roads
hurrying
to
the
city
of
doom
linemen
began
to
extend
the
wires
trackmen
began
laying
new
tracks
fully
fifty
thousand
impatient
men
were
madly
plunging
these
twenty
miles
from
different
points
of
the
circumference
converging
toward
russell
the
dead
line
had
become
a
mysterious
thing
of
the
past
the
danger
to
life
was
over
and
it
became
an
unprecedented
race
to
see
who
would
get
first
upon
the
spot
if
this
calm
lasts
as
i
think
it
will
we
will
be
on
the
ground
two
hours
ahead
of
the
crowd
swift
eyes
sparkled
in
reportorial
ecstasy
there
was
no
time
now
nor
inclination
for
words
in
ten
minutes
the
was
within
a
few
hundred
feet
of
the
doomed
city
buzzards
followed
its
descent
curiously
my
kingdom
for
a
notebook
cried
swift
in
anguish
take
mine
said
his
companion
shyly
and
my
stylo
too
swift
would
have
been
more
moved
by
this
attention
had
he
not
been
absorbed
in
the
sight
at
his
feet
do
you
mean
he
turned
to
ticks
that
this
is
all
the
effect
of
e
look
sharp
now
interrupted
professor
ariel
stand
ready
to
be
cut
down
the
professor
had
manipulated
the
so
skilfully
that
in
another
minute
they
grazed
the
serrated
ground
they
were
not
hurt
one
wide
sweep
of
the
professor
knife
and
the
freed
now
from
all
restraint
bounded
away
never
to
be
seen
again
i
am
sorry
professor
ariel
said
swift
immediately
that
circumstances
compel
me
to
postpone
my
part
of
the
contract
but
as
we
are
responsible
for
your
loss
i
will
guarantee
that
the
will
make
it
all
right
the
professor
did
not
answer
absorbed
he
followed
the
in
its
capricious
departure
with
tender
interest
when
the
three
turned
and
stared
about
them
they
stood
palsied
by
the
terrible
sight
before
them
a
sight
never
permitted
to
mortal
view
before
and
we
pray
that
such
be
withheld
from
the
gaze
of
our
poor
race
henceforth
forever
the
the
proud
the
busy
city
of
russell
had
vanished
russell
in
its
short
and
meteoric
career
had
spent
hundreds
of
thousands
of
dollars
on
its
tall
iron
fireproof
blocks
its
steel
grain
elevators
its
gilded
capitol
its
granite
churches
its
hundred
factories
its
indestructible
depots
where
were
they
where
was
the
busy
hum
of
men
not
a
girder
not
a
column
not
a
trace
of
the
complicated
iron
vertebræ
of
this
metal
city
was
left
to
mourn
the
grandeur
of
its
structures
not
a
corpse
not
even
a
bone
remained
to
tell
the
tale
of
the
death
agony
stricken
as
dumb
as
the
lower
brute
creation
this
one
poor
girl
the
sole
survivor
of
thirty
thousand
hopeful
citizens
bereft
of
home
of
friends
of
employment
of
hope
of
everything
in
life
but
this
hideous
memory
uttered
a
low
cry
and
sank
senseless
swift
laid
her
gently
on
the
parched
cracked
ground
it
was
yet
heated
as
if
a
conflagration
had
passed
over
the
place
where
but
five
days
ago
haughty
frowning
iron
blocks
of
stores
of
hotels
and
exchanges
stood
there
were
ragged
gullies
and
deep
fissures
and
jagged
ravines
shining
in
the
sunlight
with
a
black
streaked
crust
the
sight
was
dreary
and
dead
and
deserted
as
if
our
travellers
had
been
suddenly
dropped
upon
the
surface
of
the
moon
the
ground
was
riven
as
by
some
prehistoric
upheaval
it
looked
as
if
subterranean
springs
of
molten
steel
lava
had
spurted
from
the
ground
and
had
melted
the
unhappy
city
in
their
onward
path
and
had
carried
it
down
in
liquid
solution
to
the
lake
statis
ticks
picked
up
a
piece
of
this
plutonian
slag
and
examined
it
attentively
i
did
know
that
brick
would
melt
like
this
he
said
then
again
here
is
platinum
fused
with
iron
and
another
substance
i
do
not
know
in
a
second
or
two
he
added
i
see
no
remains
of
glass
it
must
have
evaporated
he
then
took
a
few
steps
it
is
lucky
he
said
meditatively
if
we
had
been
landed
a
few
more
feet
to
the
left
we
should
have
been
broiled
to
death
a
part
of
this
lava
is
still
in
a
liquid
state
vii
the
three
men
looked
each
other
in
the
eye
swift
forgot
the
girl
the
professor
forgot
the
balloon
statis
ticks
had
forgotten
his
wife
and
seven
children
but
this
was
no
unusual
circumstance
the
aeronaut
having
less
awe
to
the
cubic
inch
in
his
than
his
companions
was
the
first
to
speak
what
does
this
thing
mean
anyhow
hush
said
swift
recoiling
but
statis
ticks
bared
his
head
before
the
extinct
city
it
means
said
the
student
solemnly
the
presumptuous
impiety
of
man
and
the
vengeance
of
almighty
god
it
means
he
added
slowly
incalculable
volts
of
uncontrollable
electricity
acting
and
acted
upon
by
nascent
oxygen
and
hydrogen
it
means
that
russell
the
greatest
producer
of
the
power
on
the
continent
has
been
smitten
by
its
servant
it
means
that
man
has
outstripped
his
knowledge
of
this
mysterious
fluid
and
has
ignorantly
converted
through
millions
of
inadequate
conductors
and
faultily
insulated
wires
the
terrible
the
unfathomed
power
of
electricity
into
light
and
heat
and
force
that
russell
was
gradually
becoming
a
gigantic
storage
battery
charged
and
surcharged
until
the
time
when
its
electrostatic
capacity
had
been
criminally
abused
the
negative
forces
of
the
heavens
concentrated
over
the
obnoxious
territory
and
a
discharge
unparalleled
in
electrical
experiments
restored
nature
equilibrium
and
consumed
in
one
unspeakable
spark
russell
and
its
blind
inhabitants
my
god
can
this
happen
to
boston
cried
the
professor
trembling
or
new
york
asked
swift
or
to
chicago
added
the
girl
faintly
she
had
revived
and
was
looking
about
her
in
a
ghastly
way
my
mother
used
to
live
there
this
truly
feminine
view
of
a
scientific
subject
passed
unnoticed
ticks
stood
with
his
uncovered
head
yet
bent
before
the
annihilated
city
he
spread
his
two
hands
out
palms
to
the
ground
with
a
gesture
of
indescribable
significance
and
made
no
reply
black
vitreous
masses
of
melted
conglomerate
spread
before
them
where
had
stood
the
city
the
sloping
plain
offered
no
obstruction
to
the
view
russell
to
the
last
splinter
of
iron
or
of
wood
to
the
last
chip
of
brick
or
stone
to
the
last
bone
of
the
last
corpse
was
fused
into
a
terrible
warning
to
the
world
by
the
rebellion
of
its
own
electricity
i
guess
none
of
knew
what
struck
the
professor
hazarded
this
humane
suggestion
feeling
that
the
oppressive
silence
should
be
broken
somehow
the
kremmler
chair
was
nothing
to
it
said
swift
you
are
right
answered
ticks
gravely
that
was
the
only
boon
so
sudden
and
intense
was
the
heat
that
men
were
ashes
and
the
city
was
molten
before
nerves
could
convey
sensation
to
the
brain
in
the
fraction
of
a
second
in
the
twinkling
of
a
thought
it
was
not
for
god
took
it
the
four
breathed
heavily
again
ticks
broke
the
silence
he
laid
his
hand
paternally
upon
the
young
lady
shoulder
it
is
very
fortunate
miss
magnet
that
you
were
the
only
thoroughly
insulated
person
in
this
whole
territory
the
wooden
boat
the
inverted
glasses
saved
you
you
only
had
a
normal
amount
of
electricity
in
you
you
were
a
poor
conductor
otherwise
you
would
have
evaporated
through
the
law
of
induction
i
ca
stand
this
any
longer
or
i
be
a
fit
candidate
for
an
idiot
asylum
blurted
out
the
professor
finally
i
am
dying
for
a
chaw
he
cast
impatient
glances
at
a
trackless
desolated
grade
a
mile
away
this
grave
of
a
great
trunk
line
extended
beyond
their
view
the
four
had
not
stirred
from
where
they
had
been
dropped
by
the
balloon
to
do
so
they
would
have
had
to
pick
their
way
cautiously
russell
was
like
an
extinct
volcano
she
was
yet
hot
but
she
did
not
smoke
as
one
might
have
expected
there
were
no
smouldering
embers
left
to
produce
smoke
combustion
had
been
instantaneous
and
complete
but
the
travellers
had
no
need
to
go
everywhere
was
the
same
blackened
cooling
ferruginous
slag
to
see
one
square
yard
was
to
see
the
whole
the
appalling
thing
about
the
effect
was
the
cause
civilization
ever
ready
with
revengeful
thrusts
as
if
protesting
against
the
advance
of
science
had
produced
a
new
accident
a
unique
disaster
swift
made
an
automatic
motion
for
his
watch
i
must
go
he
said
i
must
get
my
despatch
to
the
in
time
for
the
evening
edition
we
will
have
a
scoop
on
the
whole
world
i
your
man
said
the
professor
we
can
foot
it
to
the
nearest
telegraph
station
in
four
hours
ah
i
forgot
said
swift
that
will
lose
me
the
four
edition
i
have
to
hold
the
wire
all
night
if
i
can
get
it
i
wire
such
an
account
as
no
other
paper
will
ever
get
there
is
a
minute
to
lose
it
was
then
that
statis
ticks
realizing
whether
from
calculation
or
from
sympathy
that
miss
magnet
could
make
no
such
forced
march
and
seeing
that
the
girl
only
held
herself
together
under
the
tension
of
the
great
excitement
gallantly
proposed
to
remain
by
her
and
join
the
rest
of
the
party
that
evening
by
the
first
team
that
could
be
chartered
but
the
young
lady
unexpectedly
refused
the
proposition
her
whole
nature
shrank
from
spending
another
minute
in
that
blasted
spot
it
was
therefore
arranged
much
to
ticks
disappointment
for
he
had
hoped
to
add
to
his
copious
stock
of
mental
notes
by
further
investigation
on
the
ground
that
the
girl
should
accompany
them
as
far
as
she
was
able
down
the
railroad
away
from
the
lost
city
after
a
drink
of
lake
water
they
started
off
swift
supporting
miss
magnet
on
the
one
side
and
ticks
on
the
other
the
professor
stalking
ahead
even
the
lake
tastes
of
it
said
swift
ugh
pass
a
current
of
electricity
through
a
tumbler
of
water
and
there
will
be
detected
the
same
flavor
though
not
so
strong
answered
ticks
the
party
made
two
miles
slowly
despite
all
her
western
courage
and
energy
insula
magnet
tottered
by
the
way
to
divert
her
attention
ticks
led
her
on
to
talk
about
the
electrical
wonders
of
the
extinct
city
the
girl
enlarged
in
a
sad
way
upon
its
many
and
its
curious
uses
the
baby
carriages
she
said
took
their
helpless
occupants
on
an
unaided
turn
around
a
large
oval
track
in
the
park
they
went
by
storage
battery
one
electrician
could
take
the
place
of
twenty
nurses
and
control
the
power
once
in
a
while
a
baby
died
suddenly
the
doctors
invariably
pronounced
it
a
case
of
heart
failure
washing
was
now
entirely
done
by
electrical
apparatus
likewise
ironing
and
cooking
the
great
american
problem
of
the
hired
girl
russell
considered
herself
to
have
solved
an
ingenious
arrangement
had
been
recently
devised
to
have
the
electricity
supply
the
place
of
but
only
a
few
had
used
it

phonograph

wax
cylinder

the
din
made
by
those
loquacious
instruments
was
worse

the

an
easy

your
acquaintance
up
and
see
her

while
you
talked
to
her

made
an
elaborate
toilet
for
such
interviews
it
was
soon
expected
that
conversation
would
be
entirely
dispensed
with

with
a
sensitive
galvanoscope
attached
to
the
brain
at
a
certain
point
that
was
to
be
patented

authors
would
only
need
to
fix
their
attention
upon

the
delicate
instrument
would
record
it
indelibly
for
their
gratification
the
electric
coupé
was
always
ready
there
was
no
worry
about
oats
and
spavin
and

miss

told
of
many
other
new
contrivances
that
electricity
had
now
to
perform
the
development
of
this
power
through
the
new
dynamos
made
it
possible
for
men
in
russell
to
dispense
utterly
with
work
you
went
so
far
as
to
put
five
cents
in
the
slot
at
any
one
of
a
hundred
street
corners
and
your
shoes
were
electrically
polished
to
a
patent
leather
shine
there
was
no
more
night
for
carbon
and
incandescent
lamps
had
stabbed
the
night
so
that
any
hovel
was
brighter
than
the
average

the

stopped
for
breath
and
sat
down
she
was
exhausted
swift
cheered
her
tenderly
but
ticks
dryly
remarked
a
city
without
electricity
than
electricity
without
a
city
the
girl
smiled
at
this
heresy
and
nodded
her
head
emphatically
in
a
feeble
way
she
could
hardly
move
it
was
at
this
stage
that
ticks
seemed
overcome
with
uneasiness
he
got
up
and
sat
down
again
he
kicked
the
earth
he
examined
the
charred
sleepers
he
dug
for
the
lost
rails
then
he
awoke
from
his
occupation
with
a
sudden
start
as
if
rudely
shaken
from
a
dream
swift
was
used
to
his
colleague
idiosyncrasies
besides
he
did
not
now
notice
them
he
was
otherwise
occupied
but
the
professor
could
stand
these
performances
no
longer
and
with
rude
emphasis
he
burst
forth
dang
it
man
if
you
got
anything
on
your
darned
mind
jerk
it
out
if
not
professor
ariel
manners
had
become
decadent
in
proportion
to
the
time
that
had
elapsed
since
he
and
the
had
parted
company
i
i
interrupted
ticks
with
a
start
the
fact
is
i
can
not
as
yet
account
for
that
deadly
atmosphere
that
enveloped
this
section
what
was
in
it
to
kill
its
effect
on
me
was
unlike
any
other
experience
that
i
can
recall
it
is
my
inconsolable
regret
that
it
is
not
classified
in
my
mind
did
you
know
asked
miss
magnet
suddenly
that
a
new
land
improvement
company
was
started
this
spring
for
raising
four
crops
a
year
all
the
farms
for
twenty
miles
around
were
bought
up
they
spent
over
a
million
dollars
in
laying
wires
in
the
ground
throughout
the
whole
country
on
the
theory
that
these
voltaic
currents
applied
to
grain
and
fruit
and
vegetables
would
excite
such
crops
to
quicker
verdure
and
maturity
the
company
said
that
it
was
an
experiment
on
a
grand
scale
but
they
were
much
laughed
at
i
said
it
was
a
dangerous
scheme
and
nearly
lost
my
position
in
consequence
i
have
heard
though
that
it
was
a
great
success
during
this
recital
ticks
eyes
glistened
with
excitement
ah
he
said
i
am
under
a
thousand
obligations
to
you
young
lady
of
course
i
could
not
conceive
of
such
a
thing
not
knowing
the
facts
it
is
all
plain
now
the
first
discharge
enormous
and
deadly
as
it
was
was
not
enough
this
network
of
wires
attracted
the
surplus
electricity
the
soil
must
be
of
such
a
quality
as
to
convert
this
territory
into
an
enormous
secondary
battery
the
subsoil
must
have
acted
as
a
monstrous
insulator
i
shall
subject
it
to
a
minute
analysis
are
we
on
the
verge
of
a
new
electrical
discovery
was
this
deadly
phenomenon
a
hitherto
unknown
property
of
the
electrical
fluid
for
to
walk
within
the
dead
line
was
like
walking
into
a
saturated
leyden
jar
its
effect
must
have
also
been
to
devitalize
the
oxygen
and
nitrogen
of
the
atmosphere
the
victim
was
electrified
and
suffocated
to
death
at
the
same
instant
at
last
i
understand
the
complexity
of
my
astonishing
symptoms
the
vibratory
storm
that
we
so
narrowly
escaped
was
not
due
to
barometric
depression
but
came
as
a
responsive
consequence
of
this
surcharged
area
when
that
wire
ladder
was
finally
cut
off
and
fell
when
it
reached
a
certain
position
when
one
end
touched
the
negative
the
other
the
positive
pole
then
the
current
became
completed
and
this
gigantic
battery
was
discharged
had
we
not
been
rising
at
the
rate
of
a
hundred
feet
a
second
we
should
have
been
fused
after
the
fashion
of
the
inhabitants
of
this
ghastly
territory
the
discharge
once
having
taken
place
this
country
is
again
free
to
man
and
beast
gosh
was
all
that
the
subdued
professor
could
say
and
now
the
four
travellers
lifted
up
their
eyes
and
saw
before
them
on
the
horizon
black
moving
indistinct
masses
as
if
brobdignagian
locusts
were
swarming
up
the
track
here
were
the
hosts
of
careworn
men
plunging
impatiently
toward
the
lost
city
for
the
news
that
the
unaccountable
and
malignant
power
had
hitherto
denied
them
the
four
needed
courage
to
meet
this
unrestrained
and
desperate
mob
who
were
these
in
the
van
what
pallid
faces
what
haggard
eyes
what
piteous
gestures
alas
they
were
the
mourners
of
the
dead
love
had
wrestled
its
way
ahead
of
plunder
and
grief
had
outrun
greed
in
the
front
ranks
were
women
wailing
and
panting
desperately
to
keep
pace
with
unmanned
men
this
woeful
sight
aroused
ticks
he
raised
his
hands
towards
the
lost
city
after
the
manner
of
an
inspired
prophet
and
there
and
then
uttered
the
following
impassioned
warning
to
humanity
which
swift
took
down
in
shorthand
in
the
borrowed
notebook
woe
unto
you
that
multiply
currents
you
can
not
control
woe
unto
you
that
net
your
country
with
the
trap
of
sudden
death
woe
unto
you
that
toss
innocent
men
on
broken
wires
that
surprise
your
victims
in
the
the
home
the
street
with
destructive
bolts
woe
unto
you
that
undermine
and
overcast
the
land
with
a
mysterious
foe
behold
your
dead
shall
rise
in
serried
phalanx
against
you
and
their
mourners
shall
rend
you
to
pieces
the
only
burst
of
eloquence
known
to
the
biography
of
this
prosaic
man
subsided
into
apathetic
silence
his
hands
dropped
heavily
at
his
sides
he
turned
away
from
russell
and
beheld
its
blackened
site
no
more
the
throng
was
now
upon
them
multitudes
of
wild
faces
asked
questions
of
the
four
who
would
answer
these
who
could
tell
the
terrible
truth
the
professor
paled
and
walked
behind
swift
ticks
shrank
at
the
awful
responsibility
and
took
refuge
behind
the
professor
swift
halted
and
trembled
go
he
said
to
the
girl
go
only
a
woman
can
and
she
went
she
stepped
out
alone
a
few
paces
and
stood
quite
still
instinctively
the
masses
stopped
before
her
eyes
sleepless
with
weeping
and
waiting
riveted
themselves
upon
eyes
that
were
still
haunted
with
a
portentous
experience
the
girl
stretched
out
one
hand
in
mute
appeal
and
then
burst
into
tears
and
sobbed
do
do
look
like
that
oh
you
poor
people
i
am
the
only
one
awestruck
and
silently
men
and
women
enveloped
her
and
ministered
unto
her
it
was
the
advance
guard
of
the
red
cross
society
led
by
clara
barton
that
sheltered
this
derelict
and
messenger
of
woe
set
upon
by
a
thousand
men

and
the
professor
told
what
they
knew
some
cursed
and
doubted
and
pressed
on
some
bowed
their
heads
and
turned
back
but

it

long
message
and
we
can
only
give
the
more
important
headlines

three
months
later
on
a
secular
evening
the
upholstered
pews
of
an
uptown
church
were
filled
with
a
fashionable
audience
as
the
church
bells
tolled
eight
the
organ
pealed
forth
the
wedding
march
it
was
noticed
with
much
comment
that
the

the

especially
desired

when
the
solemn
ceremony
was
ended
and
when
amid
the
craning
of
necks
the
bride
and
groom
were
walking
down
the
aisle
a
diversion
happened
that
arrested
the
newly
wedded
couple
but
this
was
not
construed
into
an
a
diminutive
messenger
boy
with
a
countenance
had
met
them
half
way
to
the
vestibule
and
with
a
saucy
smile
held
up
an
envelope
to
mr

it
half
an
hour
late
wires
burned
out

you
read
it
now
statis
ticks
who
although
well
and
worthily
married
officiated
in
some
unprecedented
capacity
as
best
man
gave
professor
ariel

of
the
ushers
an
intelligent
glance

the
happy
possessor
of

which
he
ingenuously
called

to
him
by
the
always
generous
and
fully
elated

his

answered
with
a
broad
wink
mr

unconscious
of
the
thousands
that
were
standing
in
their
seats
to
look
at
him
and
of
the
general
buzz
of
interest
tore
open
the
colored
envelope
with
reportorial
haste
and
read
as
follows
it
was
cabled
from
his
chief

proprietor
of

bliss
god
bless
you
a
terrible
evening
harland
slack
sat
in
the
café
of
the
parker
house
carelessly
sipping
whiskey
and
apollinaris
he
fondly
cherished
the
thought
that
this
combination
was
an
excellent
a
on
the
same
principle
that
b
s
is
supposed
to
clarify
an
englishman
head
harland
slack
was
an
attractively
repulsive
man
he
was
tall
and
vigorously
put
together
evening
dress
was
becoming
to
him
he
never
appeared
after
six
without
it
for
it
set
off
his
long
blond
mustache
his
fine
artificially
curled
blond
hair
and
his
pale
regular
features
to
their
best
advantage
seen
from
the
front
there
were
times
when
he
was
considered
positively
handsome
after
the
same
fashion
that
an
aristocratic
french
doll
is
admired
when
he
turned
his
profile
then
there
appeared
certain
hard
lines
of
the
check
and
weak
lines
of
the
forehead
and
chin
that
grated
on
austere
physiognomists
the
giddy
set
of
fashionable
women
at
whose
five
teas
he
still
remained
the
thought
him
adorable
the
matrons
with
marriageable
girls
thought
him
debatable
if
he
chanced
upon
a
spiritual
woman
she
considered
him
dangerous
the
club
men
privately
thought
him
unreliable
it
was
not
so
in
college
before
his
father
died
then
the
main
features
of
his
life
were
promising
if
he
indulged
in
occasional
gayety
he
did
not
lose
all
of
his
his
classmates
noted
in
him
a
certain
quality
of
strength
or
reserve
that
was
supposed
to
emanate
from
himself
rather
than
from
the
hard
fact
that
his
paternal
allowance
was
only
seven
hundred
a
year
and
that
he
was
threatened
with
disinheritance
if
he
ran
into
debt
but
now
he
had
inherited
he
had
changed
his
hands
trembled
his
eyes
twitched
the
corners
of
his
mouth
danced
the
dance
of
vitus
he
had
terrible
nightmares
and
awoke
with
parched
mouth
and
with
disagreeable
eyes
and
with
a
rebellious
head
whose
disorders
required
what
he
called
an
to
cause
them
to
abate
his
best
friends
took
him
apart
and
said
now
really
old
fellow
this
wo
do
its
playing
the
devil
with
you
come
now
knock
off
for
a
bit
i
bet
you
a
hundred
dollars
you
ca
confine
yourself
to
claret
for
a
month
and
harland
slack
would
answer
done
have
a
cocktail
he
usually
paid
the
bet
before
three
hours
were
up
the
limitation
he
said
was
too
strict
i
give
him
two
years
said
his
nearest
intimate
and
then
he
whistled
the
dead
march
in
saul
and
the
fellows
wagged
their
heads
ominously
over
the
sad
case
and
their
ale
in
short
harland
was
not
only
addicted
to
drink
but
he
was
given
over
to
it
hand
and
soul
yet
he
was
very
seldom
drunk
he
paused
at
that
excessively
polite
stage
which
was
the
surveyor
line
of
inebriety
an
eminent
pointed
him
out
one
day
and
said
it
is
the
boys
that
get
drunk
and
then
get
over
it
that
go
to
the
devil
so
fast
it
the
fellows
that
take
a
little
all
day
long
and
keep
at
it
who
ca
be
reformed
so
it
naturally
came
about
that
while
harland
slack
was
in
this
benevolent
mood
which
usually
lasted
from
ten
in
the
morning
till
one
in
the
morning
and
which
might
aptly
be
described
as
betwixt
hell
and
earth
he
became
the
common
prey
of
common
humanity
his
was
not
to
reason
why
his
was
but
to
lend
a
fi
theirs
was
but
to
take
and
sigh
i
pay
you
sometime
by
and
by
he
seemed
to
take
it
as
a
compliment
that
his
purse
was
bank
with
a
daily
run
on
it
it
was
lucky
for
him
that
the
enormous
principal
left
by
his
economical
father
could
not
be
touched
but
at
last
as
it
once
in
a
while
happens
to
the
repleted
the
unqualified
ability
to
borrow
or
rather
in
this
instance
to
steal
led
to
a
pall
unlock
every
safe
unbar
every
vault
open
up
every
store
to
pillage
and
the
robber
glutted
with
desire
will
disappear
on
the
same
principle
at
the
time
of
our
historiette
harland
friends
even
his
acquaintances
were
overtaken
by
a
sentiment
of
or
honor
and
there
was
a
general
movement
to
swear
off
borrowing
from
this
man
who
never
refused
a
loan
on
the
evening
of
which
we
speak
harland
sat
languidly
waiting
for
a
friend
who
had
an
appointment
to
accompany
him
to
the
club
it
was
early
scarcely
eight
and
he
aimlessly
fingered
a
loose
roll
of
bills
in
his
waistcoat
pocket
smiled
inanely
at
the
man
behind
the
desk
and
then
despairing
of
entertainment
began
to
spin
a
on
the
polished
table
the
café
was
nearly
empty
and
he
was
to
all
purposes
alone
this
was
a
state
which
he
dreaded
above
all
others
like
napoleon
in
the
company
of
even
one
he
felt
an
inspiring
confidence
and
security
when
he
was
with
people
he
forgot
that
whiskey
was
an
insisting
necessity
he
only
thought
he
drank
because
he
was
a
good
fellow
and
one
of
the
boys
harland
had
never
been
visited
by
the
uttermost
penalty
of
his
condition
it
can
not
be
said
that
he
never
feared
that
state
whose
ugly
name
we
omit
when
we
can
or
reduce
to
its
significant
initials
as
if
that
reduced
the
horror
of
the
fact
but
he
feared
it
he
feared
it
greatly
the
possibility
of
delirium
tremens
unmanned
him
then
he
sweat
drops
of
apprehension
and
with
vague
shuffling
remorse
promised
himself
to
improve
he
possessed
all
the
weakness
of
sydney
carton
with
none
of
that
martyr
pathetic
nobility
or
ability
harland
slack
sat
alone
and
began
to
scowl
at
the
bottle
of
apollinaris
his
weak
face
looked
haggard
perhaps
he
felt
that
he
had
cast
the
key
of
his
tomb
through
the
grated
door
after
he
had
immured
himself
within
he
glared
at
the
whiskey
and
his
thoughts
cursed
it
then
he
smiled
and
took
another
swallow
even
as
he
drank
his
mind
wandered
back
to
his
college
days
when
he
was
unimplicated
in
high
treason
against
himself
he
could
not
help
remembering
sometimes
he
seldom
thought
of
the
future
the
door
opened
he
tossed
the
remainder
of
his
glass
off
and
looked
around
expecting
his
companion
then
he
turned
back
disappointed
then
he
looked
again
a
stalwart
man
entered
with
an
air
of
vitality
which
is
often
mistaken
for
authority
the
vigorous
development
of
his
body
gave
a
startling
impression
of
height
and
power
he
was
dressed
with
elegant
negligence
his
dark
beard
was
cut
to
a
point
and
he
looked
like
a
parisian
artist
black
eyes
from
under
the
brim
of
a
silk
hat
compelled
attention
by
reason
of
an
imperious
steadiness
that
indicated
the
possession
of
unusual
the
waiters
jumped
to
serve
this
man
harland
was
annoyed
at
this
obsequiousness
which
he
had
never
received
he
tried
to
look
haughtily
indifferent
but
he
could
not
take
his
eyes
from
this
person
the
stranger
returned
his
glance
he
advanced
upon
the
fashionable
inebriate
and
paused
at
his
table
harland
slack
arose
as
if
he
were
accepting
a
challenge
and
trembled
the
two
looked
at
each
other
i
declare
old
fellow
is
it
you
why
i
have
seen
you
since
class
day
you
know
me
slack
do
you
the
speaker
smiled
and
took
off
his
hat
this
action
heightened
the
impression
of
power
which
he
had
first
made
his
forehead
was
literally
the
dome
of
his
body
it
was
as
if
the
creator
had
determined
on
granting
this
man
an
unusual
supply
of
brains
and
had
then
packed
them
in
until
the
pressure
had
distended
the
frontal
lobes
his
brow
was
an
overhanging
arch
massive
high
compelling
this
was
so
marked
that
the
head
gave
almost
a
painful
impression
of
superabundant
intellectuality
harland
immediately
recognized
his
classmate
from
that
distinguishing
feature
it
was
the
only
recognizable
one
left
randolph
the
same
do
you
live
in
boston
now
oh
yes
of
course
sit
down
and
you
i
i
am
a
practising
physician
now
that
all
am
just
back
from
paris
a
while
ago
and
have
taken
an
office
i
was
telephoned
suddenly
to
a
patient
out
of
town
and
ran
in
here
for
a
chop
before
i
went
home
the
keen
eyes
of
alaric
randolph
examined
his
as
he
gave
his
brief
explanation
he
ordered
his
chops
declined
an
offer
to
drink
and
noticed
with
professional
intelligence
harland
demand
for
some
more
whiskey
and
the
tremulous
way
with
which
it
was
taken
no
words
were
necessary
to
tell
this
student
of
human
miseries
the
nature
of
harland
slack
disease
randolph
was
as
much
changed
for
the
better
as
his
classmate
was
for
the
worse
it
was
a
wonder
that
they
recognized
each
other
at
all
harland
felt
the
difference
but
could
not
analyze
it
while
randolph
studied
it
more
than
he
felt
it
the
college
student
who
did
not
room
in
beck
and
who
was
not
a
member
of
the
hasty
pudding
club
who
had
no
time
for
society
and
theatricals
who
was
never
seen
at
carl
who
was
suspected
of
being
a
little
diffident
had
suddenly
become
the
patron
and
the
classmate
whose
father
wealth
had
given
him
an
unassailable
social
rank
yielded
with
feeble
will
to
his
own
unspoken
instinct
of
inferiority
harland
face
had
become
weazened
since
he
had
left
college
his
manly
frame
had
shrunken
on
the
other
hand
alaric
features
had
expanded
his
skull
had
filled
out
even
his
frontal
arch
was
rounded
what
have
you
been
doing
in
paris
randolph
asked
harland
with
a
laugh
and
a
faint
attempt
at
condescension
randolph
looked
across
the
table
his
eyes
twinkled
over
his
classmate
tone
but
he
courteously
answered
i
been
experimenting
there
for
five
years
i
went
the
usual
round
of
hospitals
and
studied
with
pasteur
and
have
raised
scores
of
colonies
of
bacilli
lately
i
have
busied
myself
with
investigations
of
too
complex
a
nature
to
discuss
and
you
oh
i
a
a
member
of
the
clubs
you
know
i
now
engaged
in
breeding
beagles
that
takes
lots
of
time
you
know
my
father
died
some
years
ago
and
i
eh
take
care
of
the
estate
so
exclaimed
randolph
with
a
german
lengthening
of
the
vowel
sound
then
taking
the
opportunity
while
harland
was
emptying
his
glass
he
regarded
him
thoughtfully
look
here
slack
said
the
young
doctor
after
a
moment
hesitation
what
do
you
say
to
spending
the
evening
with
me
i
am
lonely
and
want
to
talk
over
old
days
you
done
up
and
not
fit
to
go
to
the
club
now
harland
though
considerably
astonished
by
the
invitation
was
also
flattered
but
my
appointment
i
never
missed
an
appointment
in
my
life
you
know
wavered
harland
unsteadily
while
shifting
his
eyes
to
the
door
never
mind
that
now
i
leave
word
at
the
desk
psst
garçon
the
doctor
spoke
masterfully
the
gentleman
obeyed
him
as
readily
as
the
servant
a
pencil
note
with
strict
injunctions
for
delivery
solved
the
inebriate
sodden
difficulty
slack
insisted
upon
adding
that
he
would
still
meet
his
friend
between
ten
and
eleven
randolph
smiled
indulgently
and
they
passed
out
into
the
cool
air
arm
in
arm
randolph
hailed
a
coupé
and
got
his
friend
into
it
with
pardonable
alacrity
harland
was
unusually
communicative
that
evening
with
the
man
from
whom
he
would
have
hardly
deigned
to
accept
a
cigarette
in
his
college
days
he
could
not
understand
the
reason
for
what
he
considered
this
sudden
social
degradation
he
accepted
it
in
a
dazed
way
for
he
had
been
drinking
steadily
all
day
the
cab
stopped
before
one
of
the
few
stone
houses
less
common
in
boston
than
in
new
york
whose
construction
is
at
once
singularly
deceptive
and
honest
it
had
a
frontage
of
seventeen
feet
a
good
sized
observed
harland
slack
glancing
at
it
superciliously
as
he
got
out
these
are
my
offices
answered
randolph
urbanely
paying
no
attention
to
the
discourtesy
supposing
that
one
of
these
houses
with
a
frontage
of
seventeen
feet
has
a
depth
of
two
hundred
feet
and
is
five
stories
high
the
assumes
an
area
of
nearly
half
an
acre
there
may
be
large
rooms
almost
a
spacious
salon
in
one
of
these
insignificant
homes
seemingly
unlimited
space
behind
ridiculously
narrow
stone
walls
is
one
of
the
many
mysteries
of
city
life
harland
slack
sank
upon
the
sofa
and
languidly
watched
the
doctor
turn
up
the
gas
you
have
a
nip
of
brandy
have
you
i
feel
so
confoundedly
thirsty
randolph
looked
at
the
speaker
whose
wavering
eye
vainly
strove
to
elude
his
the
doctor
seemed
to
be
balancing
in
his
mind
whether
to
grant
the
guest
his
wish
or
not
look
here
old
boy
said
harland
almost
with
a
whine
it
is
fair
doncherno
to
bring
a
fellow
in
here
and
stare
at
him
that
way
my
beagles
would
treat
me
so
i
burning
up
with
thirst
just
a
little
that
hospitable
you
know
he
finished
with
a
sigh
and
a
fuddled
look
of
entreaty
he
had
gone
a
half
an
hour
without
alcohol
i
beg
your
pardon
slack
said
randolph
slowly
of
course
you
shall
have
it
but
i
would
rather
give
you
some
cordial
of
mine
first
it
will
take
your
thirst
away
sooner
than
your
infernal
liquor
slack
nodded
wearily
while
the
doctor
unlocked
a
black
cabinet
and
took
from
thence
a
brittle
flask
and
a
liqueur
glass
he
held
the
flask
up
to
the
light
before
slack
face
the
liquid
flamed
yellow
in
the
gaslight
it
seemed
to
have
concentrated
in
its
ebullient
elements
the
exhilaration
of
life
now
the
yellow
cordial
even
as
the
inebriate
looked
upon
it
glowed
and
became
incandescent
it
seemed
to
be
endowed
with
its
own
principle
of
energy
harland
slack
started
up
and
looked
at
this
phenomenon
more
closely
with
intelligent
astonishment
this
said
alaric
randolph
observantly
is
the
issue
of
many
laborious
years
abroad
this
is
the
theriaca
against
all
vital
poisons
watch
it
for
even
as
you
look
upon
it
you
absorb
its
virtue
there
was
no
melodrama
in
the
doctor
action
or
accent
he
spoke
quite
naturally
harland
was
as
much
impressed
by
his
friend
sincerity
as
by
the
singular
appearance
of
this
he
did
not
need
to
be
urged
to
look
at
the
glass
again
it
was
a
fountain
of
boiling
light
at
this
moment
a
knock
was
heard
at
that
door
of
the
reception
room
which
evidently
led
into
the
doctor
inner
office
randolph
started
quickly
locked
the
door
leading
into
the
hall
and
put
the
priceless
flask
gently
upon
a
high
bookcase
it
was
on
a
level
with
his
face
the
liquid
shot
bubbles
of
animation
to
the
surface
and
before
slack
eyes
as
if
gathering
fire
from
the
light
or
the
heat
it
slowly
began
to
turn
red
the
languid
debauchee
now
jumped
nimbly
to
his
feet
and
stood
entranced
before
this
beautiful
perplexing
transformation
keep
your
eyes
on
it
for
a
moment
my
friend
whispered
randolph
watch
it
carefully
for
me
i
wish
to
note
its
changes
it
differs
under
variable
conditions
tell
me
about
it
do
not
touch
it
when
i
come
back
you
shall
taste
and
then
harland
lost
the
last
words
as
the
physician
hurried
out
harland
slack
feeling
a
dull
sense
of
scientific
responsibility
fixed
his
eyes
upon
the
occult
fluid
watching
its
strange
manifestations
eagerly
his
brain
throbbed
with
thoughts
if
the
mere
sight
of
this
curious
elixir
could
clear
the
clots
of
alcohol
from
his
blood
and
his
will
what
might
come
of
a
draught
he
walked
for
the
first
few
moments
about
the
room
briskly
he
stood
erect
but
he
did
not
take
his
gaze
from
the
flask
nor
did
he
touch
it
it
now
shot
forth
colors
of
the
ruby
along
the
rim
played
the
fires
of
the
spinel
these
gave
way
to
the
glow
of
the
garnet
which
in
turn
vanished
before
gleams
whose
indescribable
radiance
is
only
likened
to
the
blood
of
the
pigeon
harland
was
eager
not
to
lose
the
lightest
stage
of
this
marvellous
metamorphosis
with
every
new
hue
fresh
streams
of
blood
seemed
to
come
into
his
heart
he
felt
so
strangely
that
he
soon
began
to
doubt
whether
he
were
sober
or
not
he
rubbed
his
eyes
and
pinched
his
ears
yes
he
was
awake
and
sane
this
was
no
delirium
of
a
caked
brain
his
mind
was
as
clear
as
the
waters
of
the
bermuda
reefs
if
he
had
been
an
opium
eater
he
might
have
thought
these
the
legitimate
effects
of
the
dusky
drug
as
soon
as
he
had
thoroughly
assured
himself
of
the
validity
of
his
reason
he
began
to
hear
music
it
came
from
the
inner
room
whither
the
doctor
had
gone
without
taking
his
eyes
off
of
the
blazing
flask
harland
backed
up
to
the
door
and
listened
the
strains
sounded
louder
as
he
approached
there
seemed
to
be
a
castanet
and
a
harp
and
singing
in
surprise
he
touched
the
door
it
opened
lightly
his
curiosity
proved
stronger
then
the
power
of
the
elixir
to
restrain
him
and
he
turned
a
low
cry
of
amazement
leaped
from
his
lips
he
stopped
irresolute
and
looked
back
the
glittering
alembic
was
extinguished
the
liquid
shone
but
dully
in
the
feeble
jets
of
gas
what
could
there
have
been
to
fascinate
he
mused
in
that
carafe
of
water
he
forgot
the
doctor
he
abandoned
the
theriaca
he
strode
into
the
vast
hall
that
opened
up
before
him
as
he
advanced
his
head
whirled
with
a
new
intoxication
he
wondered
how
so
narrow
a
house
could
contain
such
a
superb
apartment
then
he
perceived
or
he
fancied
that
two
or
more
buildings
had
been
thrown
into
one
it
was
the
only
explanation
of
the
spacious
area
which
his
imagination
afforded
and
it
satisfied
him
before
him
extended
a
decorated
with
oriental
magnificence
and
lighted
with
many
lamps
in
its
centre
was
a
sumptuous
table
black
servants
flitted
noiselessly
about
upon
a
yellow
rug
at
one
side
crouched
a
dark
dancing
girl
clad
in
gauze
waving
a
gauze
scarf
she
reminded
him
of
something
he
had
read
about
the
celebrated
dancers
of
the
maharajah
of
mysore
this
beautiful
girl
with
a
bewitching
effort
at
unconsciousness
arose
and
whirled
down
the
long
hall
towards
the
young
man
waving
her
bare
arms
to
the
accompaniment
of
stringed
instruments
and
the
measured
drone
of
the
players
suddenly
the
dancer
with
a
blinding
pirouette
wound
her
veils
modestly
about
her
saluted
harland
with
a
profound
mocking
courtesy
and
then
pointing
to
the
table
wafted
herself
away
harland
was
confounded
what
strange
orgy
was
this
what
a
scene
from
india
dropped
upon
bleak
staid
new
england
when
he
had
accustomed
his
eyes
to
the
blaze
of
light
he
saw
that
another
woman
was
in
the
room
this
one
was
reclining
at
the
table
he
recognized
her
immediately
this
fact
pleased
him
for
it
assured
him
that
he
was
still
himself
it
also
troubled
him
for
he
had
solemnly
vowed
never
to
allow
his
eyes
to
rest
upon
her
again
she
had
haunted
him
with
her
beauty
and
her
insolence
since
he
had
forsworn
her
there
flashed
his
sapphire
bracelet
on
her
slender
arm
and
the
alexandrite
for
which
he
had
sent
to
russia
took
to
itself
at
her
white
throat
alternate
virulent
moods
of
red
and
green
she
was
entrancing
and
he
loved
her
she
was
his
evil
genius
and
he
feared
her
she
had
flattered
and
despised
him
and
he
hated
her
how
laughingly
she
had
lured
him
with
her
jewelled
hand
and
iridescent
eyes
down
the
pleasant
path
that
brought
up
at
his
fatal
vice
he
thought
of
her
polite
orgies
her
theatre
suppers
her
one
germans
and
her
select
parties
at
suburban
hotels
to
his
besotted
brain
she
was
a
scarlet
witch
and
he
fled
from
her
and
returned
and
fled
again
but
what
manner
of
man
was
this
doctor
why
would
they
trap
him
weak
sodden
thing
that
he
was
and
knew
that
he
was
now
as
he
looked
upon
her
there
was
a
snap
in
his
heart
and
her
power
upon
him
seemed
to
give
away
and
break
like
a
valve
in
the
aorta
how
was
this
possible
could
a
man
care
for
her
with
sudden
surprising
disdain
he
approached
the
beautiful
creature
before
whom
he
had
so
often
trembled
she
did
not
look
up
at
him
but
threw
herself
back
further
on
the
couch
and
motioned
to
a
servant
for
some
wine
something
about
her
grace
revolted
him
the
music
redoubled
the
indian
dancer
fanned
him
as
she
sped
past
he
did
not
notice
her
he
was
above
intoxication
of
the
senses
what
was
this
woman
what
her
wine
in
a
kind
of
sacred
cold
revolt
he
stood
aloof
he
was
in
an
ecstasy
of
moral
freedom
he
advanced
a
step
or
two
looked
down
at
her
from
his
tall
height
and
ejaculated
brutally
here
she
did
not
look
up
at
this
insult
her
cheek
neck
and
ears
flushed
and
then
became
deadly
pale
a
sneer
now
spread
itself
over
her
chin
and
mouth
and
why
not
you
poor
fool
the
opprobrious
epithet
seemed
feebly
to
express
the
infinite
contempt
in
which
she
even
she
had
held
him
she
had
called
him
this
with
equal
scorn
more
than
once
before
in
her
and
he
had
never
felt
the
shadow
of
resentment
he
had
been
accustomed
to
laugh
feebly
and
to
turn
the
unpleasant
personality
away
as
well
as
he
could
but
now
he
became
aware
of
the
contumely
for
the
first
time
he
clenched
his
fists
he
breathed
heavily
he
did
not
trust
himself
to
speak
he
ground
his
teeth
his
thoughts
became
singularly
clear
he
took
another
step
nearer
she
turned
her
haughty
head
and
smiled
mockingly
at
him
clicking
the
glass
with
her
finger
i
did
not
know
sir
that
were
a
friend
of
the
great
doctor
she
chirped
in
her
falsetto
voice
and
her
lip
curled
its
a
lie
i
am
not
he
is
a
scoundrel
harland
spoke
savagely
he
could
not
understand
this
moral
convulsion
that
within
the
last
few
minutes
had
dominated
his
nature
he
could
only
express
it
what
was
this
house
for
the
first
time
the
query
arose
what
had
he
to
do
with
a
questionable
evening
you
are
drunk
as
usual
answered
the
woman
with
a
pert
upward
motion
of
disgust
at
this
which
he
knew
to
be
a
libel
for
once
harland
hand
tore
at
his
heart
a
terrible
rush
of
blood
ran
to
his
brain
the
music
hushed
the
dark
sank
with
exhaustion
to
her
rug
the
room
was
stifling
the
air
was
heavy
with
the
perfume
of
roses
and
attar
and
wine
yet
the
young
man
head
was
poised
his
eyes
were
sane
his
senses
untouched
with
a
supreme
effort
he
held
his
anger
in
check
the
beauty
not
realizing
the
extent
to
which
she
had
tortured
him
laughed
aloud
and
contemptuously
cried
harland
slack
you
are
a
coward
you
dare
not
call
your
soul
your
own
for
you
are
always
drunk
bah
she
made
as
if
to
draw
herself
from
beyond
his
touch
he
did
not
stir
but
a
frightful
whiteness
extended
over
his
hands
and
face
go
on
he
said
metallically
with
a
refinement
of
insolence
difficult
to
describe
ignoring
his
person
she
looked
him
and
with
a
gesture
ordered
the
music
to
begin
again
harland
stood
motionless
for
a
moment
immovable
he
fixed
his
gray
eyes
upon
a
little
black
square
of
under
the
lobe
of
her
left
ear
the
music
crashed
through
the
the
tried
to
distract
the
man
of
stone
he
looked
at
that
little
black
patch
its
wearer
shrugged
her
shoulders
significantly
then
as
if
wearied
of
the
thought
of
him
she
moved
her
white
arm
to
the
table
and
took
up
a
glass
flaming
with
champagne
waving
it
towards
him
she
said
malevolently
there
that
what
you
are
waiting
for
drink
and
go
sot
the
viciousness
of
the
act
and
word
served
as
the
key
to
the
situation
like
rusting
steel
harland
became
unlocked
oddly
enough
at
this
crisis
it
occurred
to
him
to
question
whether
this
were
his
old
friend
at
all
then
who
then
what
was
the
woman
an
embodiment
of
all
the
past
evil
of
his
own
soul
by
some
horrible
law
of
metempsychosis
had
his
old
spirit
passed
into
this
too
fashionable
married
flirt
at
his
side
that
outstretched
mocking
hand
was
it
what
the
abstainers
called
the
demon
of
drink
how
often
he
had
laughed
at
the
phrase
lighting
his
cigarette
with
their
tracts
at
the
fearful
import
of
these
thoughts
he
felt
himself
endowed
by
a
bidding
higher
than
fate
justice
arose
and
compelled
him
his
eyes
brightened
before
he
did
the
deed
with
a
sweep
he
shattered
the
hand
that
held
the
slender
glass
and
snatching
up
a
silver
knife
from
the
table
he
poised
it
for
an
instant
then
buried
it
to
the
hilt
it
struck
just
below
her
left
ear
it
obliterated
the
little
black
patch
with
a
sound
more
like
a
hiss
than
a
cry
the
woman
drooped
to
her
divan
the
music
stopped
with
a
frightened
crash
the
fled
with
a
shriek
but
harland
stood
immovable
exultant
holding
his
hands
ready
to
strangle
if
the
wound
did
not
kill
his
face
but
now
so
weak
had
acquired
an
inexorable
strength
strange
at
this
moment
he
felt
himself
not
a
murderer
but
a
man
he
watched
his
victim
dying
without
a
word
and
when
her
curse
was
spent
he
turned
and
walked
triumphantly
back
through
the
wasted
magnificence
to
the
room
from
whence
he
had
come
he
did
not
hurry
at
first
he
did
not
apprehend
arrest
he
felt
as
if
he
had
accomplished
a
great
deed
without
looking
back
he
closed
the
door
and
sought
for
his
hat
he
put
it
on
and
made
for
the
outer
entrance
he
tried
it
and
found
it
locked
now
at
last
he
began
to
comprehend
his
situation
terror
fell
upon
him
cold
drops
bathed
him
the
enormity
of
his
act
flashed
upon
his
conscience
kill
a
he
struggled
at
the
window
and
the
door
both
were
impervious
he
dared
not
go
back
how
could
he
look
at
her
escape
was
cut
off
his
head
became
clotted
with
the
old
sensations
fear
such
as
makes
a
man
heart
stand
still
assailed
him
he
looked
in
vain
for
the
flask
it
was
gone
with
a
loud
cry
he
flung
himself
upon
the
sofa
and
fainted
dead
away
how
long
he
lay
there
of
course
he
did
not
know
soon
vague
cerebrations
began
to
torture
his
mind
it
burned
as
if
it
were
being
recalled
to
life
from
a
frozen
state
then
soaring
upward
from
deeps
beyond
the
deeps
supported
through
irremediable
turmoil
by
an
overwhelming
power
he
felt
himself
gently
laid
upon
a
couch
there
was
a
moment
when
the
brain
recovering
its
equilibrium
swam
and
spun
then
suddenly
he
found
consciousness
and
emerged
through
the
mist
of
pain
he
tried
to
use
his
limbs
but
could
not
rise
with
an
effort
he
strove
to
loosen
his
tongue
but
could
not
speak
with
desperate
will
he
endeavored
to
open
his
eyes
their
lids
were
riveted
together
this
was
no
hallucination
he
was
never
more
alert
nor
more
helpless
he
knew
that
some
one
was
bending
over
him
he
felt
two
eyes
examining
his
soul
he
had
the
consciousness
that
there
was
nothing
hid
from
this
intense
gaze
then
a
commanding
voice
spoke
to
him
and
a
hand
of
unutterable
persuasion
touched
his
forehead
harland
slack
said
the
ringing
voice
beginning
a
little
above
a
whisper
it
seemed
to
increase
to
oratorical
tones
then
it
reverberated
throughout
his
nature
and
burst
upon
him
like
the
rattle
of
thunder
harland
slack
you
have
had
a
terrible
lesson
harland
slack
you
will
not
drink
again
then
after
a
pause
in
a
different
voice
now
slack
get
up
you
all
right
now
come
with
a
mighty
wrench
harland
at
his
bidding
cast
off
the
numbness
from
his
body
the
incubus
from
his
will
and
staggering
to
his
feet
opened
his
eyes
before
him
stood
alaric
randolph
holding
his
hand
and
looking
searchingly
into
his
face
this
fact
recalled
to
him
his
awful
deed
he
understood
perfectly
that
he
had
committed
a
murder
he
knew
not
how
or
why
or
where
with
a
tremulous
look
about
him
he
burst
into
tears
and
clung
for
protection
to
his
enigmatical
host
as
tenderly
as
a
hospital
nurse
randolph
led
the
criminal
to
a
deep
chair
and
placed
him
in
it
there
there
old
fellow
it
all
right
you
will
come
out
of
it
all
straight
i
see
you
through
trust
me
there
take
my
hand
that
will
help
you
see
the
broken
man
shuddering
from
weakness
clasped
the
sympathetic
hand
and
wrung
it
harland
sat
still
a
long
while
with
closed
eyes
the
doctor
watched
him
professionally
even
tenderly
at
times
anxiously
now
he
said
i
go
and
bring
you
a
it
will
set
you
on
your
feet
no
no
cried
harland
in
terror
do
leave
me
i
ca
be
left
alone
but
only
to
the
next
room
the
patient
hands
relaxed
and
he
assented
wearily
when
the
coffee
came
he
drank
a
little
obediently
now
my
boy
said
the
doctor
with
what
under
the
circumstances
seemed
to
harland
a
ghastly
cheerfulness
this
will
get
you
up
entirely
when
you
finish
it
i
am
going
to
send
you
to
the
club
at
the
mention
of
the
club
harland
began
to
tremble
my
god
randolph
i
ca
go
there
i
be
arrested
he
glanced
apprehensively
at
the
outer
door
as
if
expecting
a
policeman
do
you
know
he
added
in
a
whisper
what
i
done
in
your
infernal
place
nonsense
replied
randolph
lightly
not
a
soul
shall
know
you
been
here
she
deserved
it
i
take
all
the
blame
now
brace
up
and
be
a
man
do
be
nervous
you
feverish
you
need
a
tonic
before
you
start
what
you
drink
harland
looked
at
his
host
in
a
state
divided
between
dementia
and
moral
nausea
what
manner
of
man
was
this
american
doctor
with
his
accursed
parisian
education
i
am
horribly
thirsty
he
admitted
i
will
take
a
glass
of
water
thank
you
he
said
this
without
surprise
at
himself
naturally
and
quite
sincerely
he
longed
for
it
it
was
the
first
request
of
the
kind
he
had
made
for
years
randolph
handed
the
water
to
him
and
watched
him
narrowly
harland
held
up
the
glass
to
the
light
with
a
connoisseur
eye
smiled
with
satisfaction
and
took
the
clear
draught
down
at
one
swallow
ah
he
said
that
is
good
i
feel
better
now
now
swear
that
you
will
save
me
do
give
me
up
hide
me
somehow
it
happened
in
your
house
you
know
give
yourself
no
concern
said
the
doctor
easily
why
man
blazed
harland
slack
do
you
know
that
i
murdered
somebody
it
was
a
woman
i
murdered
that
woman
you
keep
here
i
am
a
murderer
your
club
is
only
two
blocks
off
answered
the
physician
with
astonishing
indifference
it
will
do
you
good
to
walk
there
trust
me
do
worry
over
it
let
me
feel
your
hand
it
moist
and
soft
no
fever
that
good
when
you
step
foot
into
the
club
you
will
never
think
of
the
affair
again
the
doctor
quietly
gave
the
criminal
his
hat
and
coat
put
a
cane
into
his
hand
and
conducted
him
to
the
door
go
he
said
go
directly
to
your
club
as
usual
as
a
physician
i
order
it
it
is
the
best
thing
you
can
do
mutely
the
trembling
man
obeyed
and
thus
the
two
actors
in
this
awful
evening
parted
so
perhaps
criminal
and
accomplice
are
wont
to
part
in
the
extremity
of
great
emergencies
as
if
nothing
had
happened
out
of
the
moral
order
of
things
harland
slack
walked
into
his
fashionable
club
slowly
as
he
did
so
whether
by
reason
of
the
familiar
atmosphere
or
the
contrast
to
the
scene
from
which
he
had
escaped
he
did
not
stop
to
consider
his
crime
dropped
from
his
memory
like
the
burden
from
christian
back
he
handed
his
outer
garments
to
the
liveried
boy
and
as
was
his
wont
turned
towards
the
poker
and
billiard
rooms
there
were
the
usual
number
of
useless
gambling
and
playing
men
uselessly
drinking
harland
slack
was
greeted
in
the
usual
boisterous
manner
hilloa
what
you
take
here
boy
bring
the
same
old
stuff
to
mr
slack
the
gossip
proceeded
the
chips
rattled
the
balls
clicked
the
smoke
mounted
the
liquors
gurgled
and
the
regular
club
life
proceeded
the
friend
of
his
appointment
now
joined
him
by
you
look
as
white
as
that
foam
there
you
need
a
nerve
restorer
you
have
been
idiot
enough
to
buck
the
tiger
again
have
you
what
will
you
take
no
said
harland
slowly
i
have
not
gambled
he
shook
his
head
with
a
strange
expression
he
did
not
understand
the
club
seemed
different
to
him
it
was
not
as
entrancing
or
as
necessary
as
usual
the
odor
of
stale
liquor
and
of
staler
tobacco
nauseated
him
still
it
did
not
occur
to
him
that
this
was
an
unusual
state
of
mind
for
him
to
be
in
the
attendant
placed
the
chased
tray
upon
the
table
his
friend
took
the
decanter
from
the
boy
and
poured
out
the
brown
liquid
into
the
delicate
glasses
he
then
offered
one
to
harland
and
held
up
his
own
in
token
of
courtesy
well
here
to
luck
he
said
and
nodded
to
harland
harland
nodded
in
return
his
nerves
twitched
him
what
was
this
new
sensation
of
repugnance
he
lifted
his
glass
higher
to
his
mouth
he
tried
to
put
it
to
his
lips
it
would
not
go
he
tried
again
his
arm
refused
him
service
but
the
fumes
of
this
familiar
liquor
mounted
to
his
nostrils
which
dilated
with
horror
what
was
this
terrible
thing
which
he
was
asked
to
drink
never
had
he
felt
such
physical
repulsion
a
shudder
of
disgust
shook
him
with
a
curse
he
dashed
the
glass
to
the
floor
and
glared
suspiciously
upon
his
companion
how
dare
you
ask
me
to
drink
this
stuff
his
voice
rang
with
passion
i
loathe
it
i
can
not
stand
it
let
me
go
this
is
an
infernal
den
and
i
will
get
out
the
men
around
jumped
up
and
held
him
they
thought
that
had
come
at
last
somebody
send
for
the
nearest
expert
said
his
nearest
friend
this
inebriate
first
resistance
to
his
dipsomania
was
interpreted
darkly
with
sundry
shrugs
and
winks
and
gestures
it
is
too
devilish
bad
said
his
companion
but
i
knew
it
would
happen
some
day
they
called
a
cab
and
put
him
in
and
sent
him
home
but
he
gave
no
further
evidence
of
insanity
his
case
became
a
seven
days
gossip
and
warning
behind
the
bulging
windows
of
the
great
club
harland
slack
went
straightway
to
colorado
and
came
back
a
man
he
went
into
law
and
succeeded
it
is
well
known
that
he
does
not
drink
the
committee
elected
a
new
heir
to
damnation
in
harland
place
at
the
club
at
the
end
of
an
address
delivered
a
year
afterward
before
a
close
medical
meeting
alaric
randolph
said
a
bit
of
bright
cut
glass
and
a
healthy
will
and
the
proportional
training
did
this
thing
i
have
not
given
the
man
name
not
only
on
account
of
his
high
social
standing
and
marked
mental
ability
but
also
because
he
himself
is
still
ignorant
of
the
facts
i
have
no
fear
of
a
relapse
he
has
forgotten
that
he
ever
believed
himself
to
have
murdered
a
woman
who
never
existed
but
he
has
not
forgotten
that
he
no
longer
drinks
this
case
is
now
a
tested
cure
my
first
successful
experiment
in
this
great
unknown
field
rests
upon
its
facts
alcoholism
is
probably
as
serious
an
illustration
as
we
could
present
the
hypnotic
therapeutics
have
come
to
stay
scud
it
was
the
morning
after
my
arrival
i
had
just
come
jaded
from
examination
papers
agued
with
the
incessant
ring
of
orations
abhorrent
of
the
rustle
of
white
tarlatans
distrustful
of
the
future
attitude
of
trustees
and
utterly
wilted
from
the
effect
of
a
country
academy
exhibition
held
in
the
heat
of
june
in
the
torridest
of
western
towns
i
had
never
seen
the
ocean
and
before
my
window
the
glorious
old
atlantic
heaved
solemnly
its
intermittent
swash
upon
the
rocks
sent
peace
into
my
soul
i
found
myself
near
enough
even
to
throw
something
into
the
water
the
longing
to
communicate
with
this
new
friend
dreamed
of
for
so
many
inland
years
overpowered
me
a
box
of
buttons
was
all
i
had
and
i
leaned
far
out
into
the
air
pungent
with
a
mixture
of
fish
and
kelp
and
cast
into
the
deep
these
feminine
necessities
one
by
one
now
a
tiny
disk
of
would
glance
on
the
float
and
bounce
off
into
a
gray
ripple
and
then
a
bit
of
jet
would
clatter
on
the
red
granite
rocks
and
be
swallowed
by
a
lapping
wavelet
that
seemed
to
rise
on
purpose
for
this
strange
offering
too
soon
the
box
was
emptied
of
its

then
there
came
a
mad
desire
to
throw
cologne
shoes
satchel
anything
everything
myself
from
the
window
into
this
mysterious
beckoning
repelling
atlantic
tide
beneath
me
leaning
on
the
sill
with
my
whole
soul
absorbed
in
this
new
nirvana
i
was
suddenly
and
yet
not
unpleasantly
aroused
by
a
strident
yell
hellow
scud
got
this
mornin
oh
only
little
an
a
couple
bucket
bait
the
answer
came
back
in
a
deep
orotund
voice
it
was
the
natural
intoning
of
the
man
of
the
sea
two
boats
shot
from
under
a
rocky
headland
a
few
hundred
yards
before
me
to
the
left
one
of
the
boats
made
fast
to
some
black
corks
that
formed
a
huge
rectangle
in
the
water
and
two
men
began
pulling
in
a
net
the
one
in
the
other
boat
who
answered
to
the
name
of
scud
stopped
rowing
for
a
moment
exchanged
a
word
or
two
and
laughed
aloud
then
cast
a
critical
look
at
the
altitude
and
pulled
lazily
away
when
he
was
at
some
distance
he
rested
on
his
oars
and
hilloaed
with
that
penetrating
sea
cry
i
hope
you
get
two
i
guess
thar
to
go
all
round
that
undulatory
cadence
is
entirely
lacking
in
landsmen
tones
still
this
was
an
extraordinarily
joyous
voice
as
if
the
life
of
a
fisherman
were
a
dream
without
a
care
or
a
struggle
but
scud
and
his
queer
green
boat
disappeared
behind
the
jagged
outline
of
the
rocks
and
i
turned
at
the
sound
of
the
first
bell
to
dress
for
breakfast
well
how
do
you
like
your
room
i
hope
that
the
fishermen
did
wake
you
up
too
early
my
cousin
offered
me
some
smoking
flakes
of
fish
new
to
my
limited
experience
this
he
said
was
inland
hake
and
was
caught
that
morning
in
scud
trap
now
although
i
was
hitherto
ignorant
of
this
delicious
fish
with
its
paradoxical
cognomen
i
felt
that
scud
and
i
were
already
friends
and
gravely
informed
my
host
that
scud
had
caught
little
ones
that
morning
this
piece
of
information
was
immediately
greeted
with
impertinent
hilarity
so
scud
woke
you
up
said
my
cousin
he
always
doing
that
there
was
one
nervous
boarder
here
she
threatened
to
have
him
arrested
for
breaking
the
peace
but
you
might
as
well
arrest
a
does
he
always
get
up
as
early
in
the
morning
i
asked
apprehensively
he
must
be
a
very
energetic
person
do
tell
me
about
it
what
are
i
must
confess
to
a
degree
of
perplexity
when
the
the
whole
family
burst
into
further
roars
of
laughter
at
my
simple
question
scud
energetic
why
he
is
the
easiest
the
slowest
the
sleepiest
the
most
lovable
fellow
on
the
whole
coast
he
makes
the
surest
and
perhaps
the
best
living
of
any
of
the
fishermen
around
here
if
he
did
get
up
early
he
would
do
even
that
as
it
is
salt
does
most
of
the
work
salt
is
his
oldest
boy
explained
my
cousin
i
am
sure
scud
needs
all
he
can
make
interrupted
mabel
she
is
my
cousin
wife
with
his
dozen
children
and
a
wife
to
support
and
only
one
trap
to
do
it
on
for
my
part
interposed
the
oldest
daughter
with
a
pert
motion
of
her
head
i
am
tired
to
death
having
to
save
clothes
for
that
you
look
so
shocked
mamma
yes
i
am
it
always
care
of
that
petticoat
betty
can
use
it
or
dress
can
be
turned
and
made
over
nicely
for
the
twins
i
declare
i
do
get
a
new
dress
but
the
whole
scud
family
troop
over
and
inspect
it
and
criticise
it
and
quarrel
over
it
and
gloat
over
it
the
first
day
i
wear
it
i
caught
two
of
their
boys
fighting
over
which
of
them
should
have
reginald
summer
ulster
when
he
was
done
with
it
i
shall
give
it
to
tommy
observed
her
mother
in
an
absent
comfortable
tone
after
breakfast
my
cousin
rowed
over
to
the
station
the
eldest
two
children
took
their
guest
a
boy
of
about
sixteen
out
fishing
while
i
eagerly
accompanied
mabel
across
the
rocks
and
fields
to
scud
house
a
little
rented
hut
hidden
and
sheltered
from
the
east
winds
behind
a
huge
barrack
of
a
how
clear
the
day
how
warm
the
sun
how
hospitable
this
forbidding
north
shore
as
i
look
back
upon
that
memorable
morning
it
seemed
as
if
the
bay
could
never
be
ruffled
by
any
but
the
tenderest
breezes
or
its
bright
water
reflect
any
but
the
dazzling
glare
of
the
hottest
sun
clouds
hovered
over
us
delicate
and
fleecy
as
the
feathers
of
the
marabou
and
white
and
curly
as
the
feathers
of
the
ostrich
they
radiated
from
a
centre
in
translucent
films
and
shot
out
monstrous
ciliated
fingers
like
a
fan
such
a
sky
was
never
seen
in
my
part
of
the
country
and
i
attributed
this
ravishing
cloud
phenomenon
to
the
peculiar
influence
of
the
sea
being
too
ignorant
to
notice
that
these
streamers
shot
out
from
the
west
the
stillness
was
intoxicating
after
the
scurry
of
the
and
now
even
the
water
made
no
ripples
on
the
beach
the
sea
was
motionless
like
a
distilled
elixir
in
a
serrated
alembic
we
stopped
before
a
low
house
that
looked
as
if
it
contained
three
rooms
at
most
the
yard
was
piled
up
with
wreckage
and
who
ever
heard
of
a
fisherman
buying
kindling
within
the
gate
four
children
were
playing
with
twice
as
many
cats
and
kittens
they
were
all
fighting
like
animals
between
themselves
for
a
plateful
of
scraps
of
fried
fish
a
baby
would
grab
a
piece
from
the
plate
and
offer
the
remainder
to
a
grave
tabby
which
in
turn
distributed
it
to
her
offspring
then
the
kittens
and
humans
rolled
and
scratched
and
shrieked
and
scratched
again
keep
yer
mouths
shet
out
there
or
i
be
after
ye
with
a
stick
this
maternal
sentiment
spoken
in
a
loud
shrill
voice
greeted
us
as
we
stepped
within
the
gate
it
i
betty
i
have
brought
you
a
little
something
and
a
friend
who
wants
to
see
the
children
dear
sakes
you
is
it
the
shrill
voice
was
now
modulated
in
an
entirely
different
tone
ai
i
glad
you
come
step
right
in
and
set
down
no
then
i
be
out
and
see
ye
ez
soon
ez
i
tended
the
baby
baby
i
gasped
looking
at
the
four
fighting
infants
at
my
feet
none
of
whom
looked
over
thirteen
months
are
these
hers
too
these
are
the
twins
answered
mabel
quite
seriously
they
call
them
twin
these
are
the
two
sets
just
a
year
apart
the
baby
was
born
a
month
ago
the
baby
is
named
let
me
see
these
are
bessie
and
maurie
and
robbie
and
susie
why
i
thought
you
knew
better
protested
the
mother
in
a
grieved
voice
susie
is
in
the
house
there
that
bessie
she
wiped
her
hands
on
her
apron
and
thrust
one
of
them
out
through
a
rent
in
the
door
i
glad
to
see
any
of
friends
yes
good
mor
the
children
laws
sakes
they
round
the
house
like
pups
the
face
was
remarkable
for
a
pair
of
brilliant
black
eyes
an
inheritance
of
italian
ancestry
she
was
not
yet
and
her
hair
had
turned
prematurely
gray
her
hands
were
bony
nervous
hands
indicative
of
great
executive
capacity
but
the
incessant
work
had
left
them
trembling
are
all
your
children
here
i
asked
not
knowing
what
else
to
say
here
four
of
come
out
here
you
in
there
an
i
count
ye
it
was
a
pitiful
sight
to
see
these
five
plump
rosy
youngsters
pass
in
review
before
the
frail
emaciated
mother
but
here
are
only
nine
i
ventured
salt
missing
mother
said
the
eldest
girl
he
with
father
to
the
trap
so
he
is
kittie
they
rowed
round
the
cove
with
what
they
ketched
they
be
back
but
how
do
you
manage
ah
scud
i
asked
i
am
afraid
there
was
a
slight
choke
in
my
throat
as
i
spoke
the
mother
cast
a
quick
look
at
my
face
and
shoving
her
children
into
the
house
one
by
one
said
now
go
kittie
finish
the
dishes
you
mamie
put
the
baby
kearfully
in
the
box
what
did
you
hit
jim
for
sammy
let
me
ketch
you
your
little
brother
agin
an
i
spank

in
the
house
all
of
ye

miss
turning
to
me
we
manage
somehow
if
it
fur
we
give
up
there
that
boy
jim
he
took
to
swearing
this
spring
i
declare
it
was
jess
awful
to
hear
him
go
on
i
spanked
him
and
scud
he
switched
him
but
it
to
no
use
that
boy
talked
jess
till
your
cousin
here
miss
she
heerd
him
one
mornin
took
a
white
powder
an
put
a
little
on
his
tongue
it
made
jim
powerful
sick
and
says
she
i
hear
you
swearin
agin
i
pizen
ye
you
die
in
a
minute
an
never
see
god
and
i
declare
to
goodness
he
was
so
skeared
that
i
hai
heerd
him
swear
since
there
scud
where
salt
pa
come
here
an
speak
to
the
ladies
she
brought
ye
some
ties
salt
makin
the
boat
fast
began
scud
nodding
with
inimitable
ease
to
his
visitors
i
afraid
ther
goin
to
be
scud
stopped
short
in
pleasure
when
he
saw
a
couple
of
brilliant
red
and
blue
ties
dangling
from
betty
hand
he
had
come
up
the
rocky
path
whistling
like
a
boy
with
every
line
and
pucker
in
his
face
on
a
broad
smile
if
lavater
had
seen
this
fisherman
physiognomy
he
would
have
pronounced
it
indicative
of
incomparable
good
nature
indeed
scud
good
nature
went
so
far
at
times
as
to
be
incomparably
inadequate
to
the
demands
of
existence
if
he
happened
to
go
for
weeks
without
catching
so
much
as
a
sculpin
in
his
net
and
the
starvation
of
his
youngsters
stared
him
in
the
face
he
showed
none
of
the
common
symptoms
of
discouragement
such
as
swearing
drinking
beating
his
wife
or
cursing
his
luck
he
only
whistled
the
blither
ran
up
bills
at
the
butcher
and
grocer
with
irresistible
faith
borrowed
his
chaws
of
his
luckier
mates
and
laughed
as
if
poverty
were
an
excellent
joke
that
providence
was
cracking
at
him
why
should
he
appreciate
it
even
if
it
were
at
his
own
expense
scud
was
born
easy
who
could
blame
him
he
gave
up
his
because
it
took
too
much
time
to
dry
them
and
keep
them
in
repair
and
it
was
too
cold
and
dangerous
hauling
them
in
stormy
weather
off
the
rocks
scud
found
it
too
troublesome
to
underrun
his
trap
more
than
twice
once
at
six
in
the
morning
then
at
six
at
night
even
when
the
mackerel
or
the
herring
struck
and
every
man
who
had
a
trap
hovered
over
it
night
and
day
to
keep
the
catch
from
mysteriously
immaterializing
as
well
as
to
gather
it
in
scud
was
satisfied
with
his
diurnal
visits
he
to
keep
to
see
the
fish
swim
in
if
they
were
fool
to
go
in
the
trap
they
could
stay
there
till
he
underrun
an
bailed
out
his
methods
of
gaining
a
livelihood
were
unique
on
the
coast
yet
it
was
scud
who
stocked
eight
hundred
and
fifty
dollars
that
summer
clean
two
hundred
dollars
above
any
one
else
in
the
harbor
it
was
the
saying
among
some
of
the
jealous
fishermen
in
the
cove
who
were
not
blessed
with
two
pairs
of
twins
that
nobody
so
easy
a
livin
as
scud
without
doin
no
work
but
these
indistinct
murmurs
never
stimulated
scud
nor
impaired
his
good
nature
indeed
scud
was
the
happiest
man
that
ever
lived
what
a
dancing
laughing
eye
what
a
catalogue
of
joys
therein
what
contagious
hopeful
humor
what
irrepressible
buoyancy
of
spirits
who
could
help
loving
scud
as
one
loves
a
huge
bernard
dog
scud
was
the
laughing
joyous
piping
pan
of
the
ocean
he
smoked
not
neither
did
he
drink
he
had
no
vices
that
debased
him
chewing
is
not
a
vice
for
a
fisherman
but
he
did
have
a
curious
taste
for
candy
no
present
pleased
him
so
much
as
a
half
a
pound
of
caramels
or
of
nuts
it
was
the
sweet
animal
nature
instinctively
laying
hold
of
sweets
scud
easiness
was
unmitigated
at
times
it
was
exasperating
but
this
made
him
all
the
fatter
the
jollier
the
more
companionable
and
as
it
succeeded
so
well
why
not
summer
boarders
were
appreciative
of
scud
he
lived
upon
them
twins
they
did
it
it
was
a
dime
show
and
the
money
was
paid
two
sets
of
authentic
twins
it
was
enough
to
drain
a
woman
heart
of
sympathy
a
woman
pocket
of
money
and
the
summer
boarders
were
mostly
women
married
women
with
husbands
sweating
in
the
city
to
support
them
single
women
and
that
sort
but
scud
stood
looking
at
the
ties
he
seldom
bought
clothes
any
more
than
he
purchased
firewood
or
paid
for
his
fish
they
came
to
him
here
was
a
pair
of
trousers
that
was
once
a
bishop
that
coat
and
vest
were
the
velveteen
relics
of
a
posing
artist
the
cap
was
a
yachtsman
gift
and
the
neckties
came
as
a
matter
of
course
yet
scud
never
begged
and
once
when
he
caught
one
of
his
boys
insinuating
to
a
summer
boarder
with
outstretched
palm
that
he
would
like
a
penny
scud
thrashed
him
within
a
centimeter
of
his
life
new
england
fishermen
will
take
a
gift
as
a
sort
of
neighborly
accommodation
to
you
but
starve
before
he
will
ask
you
for
it
are
them
fur
me
scud
was
always
surprised
at
such
a
crisis
thank
ye
ai
them
showy
i
guess
they
skeer
the
off
the
coast
i
wanted
you
to
take
me
out
sailing
this
morning
scud
i
began
after
a
formal
introduction
scud
looked
somewhat
gratified
with
the
prefix
to
his
name
and
regarded
me
with
interest
to
take
boarders
out
sailing
at
the
rate
of
cents
an
hour
was
the
kind
of
work
he
would
do
yes
but
i
it
be
a
little
fresh
if
ye
used
to
sailin
he
jerked
his
head
to
the
westward
salt
is
a
the
dory
fast
with
a
new
i
guess
we
have
a
squall
pretty
soon
we
followed
scud
gesture
and
looked
a
squall
on
a
day
like
this
the
white
streamers
had
vanished
and
above
us
was
dark
unfathomable
blue
but
on
the
western
horizon
stretching
far
to
the
south
a
black
bank
had
arisen
no
cloud
in
the
physical
geography
was
ever
sketched
blacker
it
had
come
up
as
stealthily
as
a
zulu
warrior
it
was
the
hue
of
unpolished
iron
it
had
a
faint
reddish
tint
its
outline
was
as
clear
cut
as
a
cameo
it
sent
ahead
here
and
there
jagged
tentacles
broad
at
the
base
and
fine
at
the
tip
that
advanced
dissolved
and
reappeared
again
with
significant
rapidity
the
ocean
had
suddenly
grown
lethargic
it
seemed
unable
to
reflect
the
sun
that
still
shone
it
became
like
a
platter
of
tarnished
silver
as
we
looked
the
sight
rapidly
grew
uglier
now
my
cousin
mabel
seemed
hypnotized
by
it
she
stood
for
a
few
minutes
with
her
hands
hanging
at
her
sides
her
delicate
jaw
dropped
suddenly
she
pulled
herself
together
and
whispered
it
is
horrible
it
is
awful
then
as
if
seized
with
the
full
import
of
the
scene
she
cried
aloud
my
they
are
out
fishing
in
a
my
she
began
to
run
towards
the
shore
leaving
us
all
staring
after
her
my
nautical
sense
was
not
as
highly
trained
as
mabel
but
i
thought
the
sight
terrifying
and
fine
it
was
part
of
the
eastern
culture
towards
the
education
of
the
western
girl
but
seeing
scud
look
sober
i
had
the
impression
that
it
was
for
the
first
time
in
his
life
i
pleaded
do
come
too
scud
is
it
so
bad
wo
it
blow
over
it
goin
to
be
as
bad
as
i
ever
seed
in
these
parts
miss
i
do
what
i
can
be
much
i
bet
i
ran
down
to
the
house
followed
by
scud
at
a
moderate
walk
scud
never
ran
would
he
have
run
for
the
drowning
i
doubted
it
the
clouds
had
arisen
with
terrible
velocity
they
coursed
over
the
bare
sky
like
a
black
bull
with
horns
down
white
cirrhus
clouds
now
darted
out
here
and
there
ahead
like
fluttering
standards
of
warning
and
now
the
sun
was
gored
to
death
the
black
bank
advanced
in
one
wide
line
blackness
had
fallen
everywhere
anxiety
was
visible
in
every
form
of
nature
in
the
cries
of
the
birds
the
skulking
of
the
dogs
the
blanched
faces
of
the
boarders
the
attention
of
the
fishermen
in
the
british
navy
when
any
terrible
and
sudden
disaster
occurs
on
a
such
as
the
bursting
of
a
gun
a
collision
or
striking
upon
the
rocks
the
bugler
sounds
what
is
known
as
the
still
on
hearing
it
every
man
aboard
comes
to
a
standstill
this
momentary
pause
enables
each
to
collect
his
nerves
to
meet
the
summons
of
the
shock
nature
was
now
commanding
the
still
but
the
order
came
through
the
eyes
no
sound
was
as
yet
heard
the
sea
the
air
sentient
life
all
souls
held
their
breath
before
the
shock
that
must
come
men
collected
along
the
coast
to
meet
the
threatened
tornado
by
that
subtle
force
which
sensitive
organisms
will
recognize
be
it
called
telepathy
or
psychic
power
or
magnetism
i
knew
ignorant
as
i
was
that
nature
was
silently
preparing
for
a
terrific
struggle
when
scud
and
i
joined
mabel
on
the
rocks
in
front
of
her
house
we
found
her
wringing
her
hands
sobbing
and
crying
for
help
it
seemed
that
her
two
children
who
had
gone
out
fishing
with
their
city
guest
were
in
a
this
was
managed
by
a
boy
about
their
age
none
of
them
were
over
sixteen
but
the
lad
who
sailed
the
little
boat
was
a
son
he
was
considered
very
expert
and
had
broad
experience
from
his
babyhood
up
but
this
fact
did
not
soothe
the
mother
appalled
by
the
color
and
the
swiftness
of
the
clouds
and
the
ominous
import
to
the
safety
of
the
little
we
scanned
the
harbor
and
the
coast
but
no
boat
answering
to
the
description
was
in
sight
scud
tried
to
comfort
the
mother
in
his
shaggy
way
the
hev
sailed
to
the
inner
cove
they
ashore
by
this
time
i
bet
as
scud
spoke
the
large
leaving
and
entering
the
broad
harbor
shot
one
after
the
other
as
if
by
mutual
impulse
into
the
direction
of
the
clouds
into
the
west
and
dropped
sails
and
anchors
with
incredible
rapidity
far
out
to
sea
vessels
were
now
seen
to
ride
with
bare
poles
it
was
evident
that
they
had
anticipated
a
formidable
blow
we
stood
on
a
bend
in
the
shore
and
the
broad
bay
lay
between
us
and
the
rising
storm
the
rocky
coast
stood
forth
in
a
long
broken
outline
opposite
to
us
far
down
towards
great
brabant
the
open
atlantic
spread
before
us
to
the
and
now
lightnings
flashed
in
angry
sheets
the
sea
took
to
itself
suddenly
a
peculiar
greenish
tinge
there
were
heard
distant
bellowings
we
strained
our
eyes
for
the
boys
where
were
they
where
they
two
miles
out
ships
began
to
rock
fearfully
they
cotched
it
shouted
scud
here
it
comes
look
out
leddies
driven
by
earth
mightiest
most
implacable
most
invisible
force
a
line
of
foam
dashed
across
the
bay
spray
from
the
water
twenty
feet
below
struck
us
in
the
face
simultaneously
with
the
wind
the
white
squall
had
burst
upon
us
i
dragged
my
poor
cousin
with
me
to
the
piazza
into
the
house
which
shuddered
through
all
its
frame
and
would
have
fallen
had
it
not
after
the
fashion
of
this
bleak
shore
been
chained
to
the
rocks
now
scud
staid
outside
it
did
not
seem
clear
at
first
why
pretty
soon
we
saw
him
trying
to
pull
the
tender
upon
the
float
that
was
clean
washed
by
every
wave
then
came
the
first
lull
the
mother
ran
out
into
it
wildly
the
water
was
green
and
white
two
coasters
and
a
large
yacht
were
running
in
for
shelter
without
a
stitch
of
canvas
they
were
making
straight
for
the
inner
harbor
look
come
here
look
what
that
boat
see
way
out
there
beyond
the
island
my
god
it
a
or
more
away
in
the
very
heart
of
the
squall
a
little
boat
with
full
sail
set
was
staggering
unto
death
language
can
not
hint
at
the
horror
in
the
mother
face
she
had
made
her
summer
home
for
fifteen
years
within
a
shell
throw
of
the
sea
and
she
knew
perfectly
well
what
this
situation
meant
no
one
could
have
undeceived
her
and
no
one
tried
she
stood
for
a
moment
staring
straight
ahead
stretched
out
her
arms
swayed
and
fell
she
was
one
of
the
fainting
kind
and
there
was
nothing
to
be
done
about
it
we
carried
her
in
and
laid
her
down
it
was
my
impulse
to
trust
her
to
her
terrified
servants
i
was
too
terrified
myself
to
know
whether
i
was
right
or
wrong
irresistibly
compelled
i
rushed
out
of
doors
again
and
appealed
with
feminine
instinct
i
suppose
to
the
only
man
within
reach
scud
responded
quickly
enough
yes
that
them
he
pitched
his
orotund
voice
upon
me
as
if
he
were
giving
a
command
in
a
gale
at
sea
men
now
began
to
gesticulate
wildly
at
the
boat
from
the
rocks
as
if
that
could
help
the
matter
drop
that
you
fools
or
you
go
to
the
voices
struck
me
like
a
volley
of
bullets
but
they
could
not
have
penetrated
ten
feet
to
windward
scud
i
cried
help
save
them
scud
i
ca
do
nothing
he
howled
in
my
ear
no
one
ca
you
ca
row
in
them
breakers
by
this
time
the
wind
had
increased
its
force
the
was
near
enough
for
one
to
see
the
desperate
attempts
the
boyish
skipper
made
to
lower
the
sail
one
of
the
halyards
had
become
caught
the
boy
made
wild
rushes
to
the
mast
then
the
boat
would
rock
and
fly
around
to
save
her
the
lad
darted
back
to
the
helm
just
in
time
this
sickening
struggle
against
a
knot
was
repeated
several
times
on
the
bottom
the
three
passengers
lay
inert
with
terror
a
boat
with
full
sail
when
schooners
trembled
under
bare
poles
even
my
inexperience
grasped
the
situation
he
doing
well
but
he
ca
last
no
longer
if
that
be
druv
on
the
rocks
they
be
druv
to
the
rocks
were
now
lined
with
men
commenting
in
an
apathetic
way
upon
the
tragedy
enacting
before
their
eyes
why
do
they
something
in
my
ignorance
of
the
curious
stolidity
which
falls
upon
the
shore
in
face
of
danger
upon
the
sea
i
stood
shrieking
why
does
somebody
go
why
do
you
men
do
the
fishermen
and
the
summer
people
looked
into
each
other
eyes
but
no
man
answered
a
word
ca
help
them
i
pleaded
with
another
fisherman
ca
be
done
or
i
do
it
i
came
down
to
see
them
capsize
an
i
guess
they
go
said
a
gruff
voice
but
scud
gave
me
a
long
look
he
stood
quite
silent
an
expression
of
rare
gravity
was
on
his
joyous
face
he
glanced
apprehensively
from
the
boat
to
the
house
ca
scud
she
fainted
there
is
anybody
but
me
to
do
something
the
children
have
to
be
saved
scud
the
western
girl
shook
him
by
the
arm
her
very
ignorance
gave
a
force
to
her
appeal
that
intelligence
could
not
have
supplied
had
i
understood
what
i
asked
i
should
not
have
said
scud
wo
you
go
they
are
drowning
see
scud
the
doomed
sail
was
beaten
here
and
there
in
the
fierce
wind
the
jib
was
blown
to
tatters
the
boat
took
in
water
righted
and
careened
with
every
riotous
puff
a
hundred
times
men
turned
their
faces
away
and
women
shrieked
expecting
it
to
go
down
a
hundred
times
repeated
miracle
protected
the
helpless
boat
scud
walked
slowly
down
the
heaving
gangway
that
connected
the
rocks
with
the
float
the
man
who
came
down
to
see
the
boat
capsize
followed
with
his
hands
in
his
pockets
he
balanced
himself
on
the
railing
with
his
elbows
as
the
gangway
jumped
beneath
him
what
yer
up
ter
scud
he
yelled
above
the
tempest
they
on
yer
trap
that
fetch
scud
looked
up
his
feet
were
washed
in
the
water
that
flooded
the
float
at
every
surge
to
strike
the
trap
meant
instant
overturn
to
become
entangled
in
and
driven
on
to
the
meshes
of
the
broad
deep
net
meant
inevitable
death
i
guess
i
go
help
me
shove
the
dingy
off
so
spoke
scud
deliberately
you
the
rest
of
the
expletive
was
lost
in
the
gale
the
breakers
made
sport
of
scud
and
spat
at
him
with
their
white
tongues
your
childer
the
twins
betty
thundered
his
friend
scud
hurriedly
put
in
the
as
he
bent
the
wind
caught
his
cap
and
dashed
it
on
the
rocks
scud
shook
his
brown
hair
to
the
furies
ye
see
yelled
his
companion
significantly
now
get
in
will
ye
shet
up
steve
gim

ye
see
i
goin
i
wish
i
hed
my
dory
a
murmur
of
applause
went
up
from
the
crowd
as
the
fisherman
shoved
off
the
light
tender
was
twisted
about
and
all
but
cast
upon
the
cliffs
before
he
could
gain
his
first
stroke
and
now
the
man
of
the
sea
set
his
weak
mouth
into
petrified
resolve
the
wind
and
the
water
attacked
his
boat
like
assassins
they
meant
to
kill
scud
knew
this
he
rowed
guardedly
mistrustful
of
a
cowardly
feint
of
an
underhand
lunge
the
tender
quivered
beneath
each
dash
of
the
waves
each
onslaught
of
the
squall
each
hurried
stroke
of
the
oars
scud
rowed
warily
lest
he
be
and
buried
between
the
trough
and
the
height
of
the
waves
the
wind
howled
at
him
the
bay
showered
upon
him
the
gale
clutched
him
and
turned
him
about
how
now
whence
came
these
muscles
of
steel
that
subdued
such
powers
arrayed
against
lazy
scud
how
now
whence
came
that
indomitable
judgment
that
baffled
the
elements
at
their
own
wildest
sport
fishermen
stared
from
the
shore
at
this
unparalleled
exhibition
of
skill
coolness
courage
and
strength
from
then
with
the
spite
of
which
only
a
white
squall
is
capable
it
thundered
against
scud
and
with
the
animosity
of
which
only
the
atlantic
ocean
is
capable
it
rose
upon
scud
and
bore
him
under
hope
is
easily
dashed
in
the
hearts
of
inert
spectators
but
scud
did
not
falter
the
crowd
stood
by
commenting
scud
thet
scud
poor
betty
poor
widder
we
hev
ter
fish
him
up
plucky
fellow
brave
deed
that
grit
thar
skill
thought
it
but
scud
the
easy
scud
the
scud
the
scud
of
whom
nobody
expected
anything
comfortable
scud
rowed
on
sturdily
straight
out
into
that
hell
could
he
ever
overtake
the
boat
how
was
it
possible
if
he
did
the
extra
weight
would
swamp
the
fancy
tender
built
only
to
carry
two
or
three
at
the
most
in
light
weather
how
could
he
get
one
in
why
the
did
he
take
his
dory
asked
an
old
man
how
in
can
he
bring
her
up
with
a
an
git
in
from
the
rocks
answered
another
contemptuously
scud
may
get
ventured
an
expert
but
what
he
do
with
now
scud
had
rowed
beyond
the
net
to
the
right
in
order
to
bear
down
upon
it
the
easier
thar
she
strikes
god
help
cries
came
from
a
dozen
throats
the
struck
against
the
leader
of
the
net
it
swung
broadside
to
the
wind
that
forced
it
over
and
under
agonized
shrieks
were
borne
to
the
shore
i
was
glad
that
mabel
was
a
fainting
woman
for
some
time
scud
wife
had
stood
apart
and
looked
upon
the
scene
her
eyes
were
dry
and
feverish
she
did
not
talk
she
hugged
a
baby
at
her
breast
desperately
salt
held
a
pair
of
twins
the
oldest
girl
another
children
sprawled
upon
the
ground
clinging
to
their
mother
feet
and
dress
none
drew
near
or
spoke
to
this
pathetic
group
what
could
one
do
what
word
could
one
say
the
storm
swayed
betty
here
and
there
her
hair
waved
in
the
hurricane
she
had
long
pretty
hair
spray
drenched
her
she
did
not
cry
out
she
stood
like
the
niobe
of
the
sea
she
looked
like
one
expecting
the
fate
that
had
been
only
delayed
an
average
of
two
hundred
men
a
year
from
this
are
swallowed
up
by
the
ocean
that
affords
them
sustenance
and
their
starving
widows
are
left
after
them
betty
was
only
one
of
a
thousand
of
her
kind
who
stolidly
concealed
a
desolate
suspense
and
now
her
turn
had
come
harder
than
the
rest
for
she
was
in
at
the
death
it
is
a
mystery
until
this
day
how
scud
reached
the
as
he
did
with
a
dory
his
work
would
not
have
been
comparatively
easy
but
with
a
yacht
tender
it
was
the
two
girls
clinging
to
the
wreck
were
lifted
bodily
into
the
boat
scud
was
quick
but
cool
and
imparted
perfect
confidence
to
the
children
at
the
fisherman
peremptory
order
the
two
boys
clung
to
each
side
of
the
tender
we
could
see
them
dragging
in
the
water
it
was
the
only
way
scud
now
began
to
row
before
the
storm
there
were
no
cheers
from
the
rocks
not
a
man
of
them
stirred
the
fishermen
hardened
to
perils
of
the
sea
had
been
fascinated
by
this
exhibition
of
heroism
from
the
least
heroic
of
them
all
the
dashed
madly
towards
the
shore
no
power
could
row
it
weighted
against
the
wind
that
beat
upon
it
with
fitful
concentration
straight
before
the
tender
was
a
little
beach
between
the
rocks
not
more
than
twenty
feet
wide
but
this
was
protected
at
its
entrance
by
a
line
of
reefs
easily
passable
at
high
tide
and
bare
at
low
the
rollers
broke
upon
most
of
these
rocks
and
the
spume
swirled
in
dirty
froth
upon
the
pebbly
beach
scud
made
for
the
opening
the
gale
drove
him
wildly
along
a
few
men
now
ran
to
the
beach
and
the
outlying
rocks
ready
to
do
the
possible
at
any
emergency
would
scud
pass
the
reef
or
not
there
was
not
time
to
answer
the
question
the
boat
rose
upon
a
huge
wave
foam
and
spray
enveloped
it
from
view
there
was
a
rumbling
cry
of
horror
there
was
a
dull
splintering
crash
fifty
men
rushed
to
the
beach
and
lined
the
cliffs
the
boat
had
struck
upon
the
last
rock
as
the
wave
passed
on
the
terrible
sight
of
black
human
heads
appeared
in
a
setting
of
white
foam
but
these
were
within
reach
almost
these
could
be
saved
ah
men
wade
in
somehow
anyhow
forming
a
line
and
pass
one
to
shore
saved
and
then
another
thank
god
here
comes
the
third
on
that
wave
grasp
that
dress
tenderly
it
is
a
girl
all
here
all
saved
but
where
is
scud
oh
but
can
swim
he
is
strong
and
used
to
chilling
water
and
fierce
waves
the
helpless
children
safe
and
scud
gone
impossible
incredible
too
horrible
involuntarily
one
man
and
then
another
turned
to
look
at
the
widow
and
the
orphans
and
then
they
turned
and
cursed
the
sea
aloud
at
this
moment
a
dark
little
figure
shot
past
them
all
by
the
bewildered
man
and
dashed
with
a
shriek
into
the
foam
what
did
she
do
how
did
she
do
it
what
could
be
done
a
woman
a
little
woman
her
baby
only
one
month
old
betty
she
caught
the
sinking
hand
the
drowning
head
she
never
knew
how
a
dozen
men
plunged
in
now
spectators
who
had
not
wet
their
feet
during
all
that
horrible
scene
swam
now
in
the
whirlpool
for
the
woman
sake
and
for
the
shame
she
wrought
upon
them
brawny
arms
and
steady
feet
bore
her
back
her
little
hand
rigid
clutched
her
husband
by
the
collar
of
his
shirt
scud
was
carried
quickly
up
and
laid
upon
the
piazza
an
ugly
bruise
was
upon
his
forehead
the
wind
died
down
the
rain
came
in
white
torrents
betty
stood
in
the
deluge
and
shielded
her
husband
automatically
the
children
most
of
them
too
small
to
know
the
reason
why
lifted
up
their
voices
and
wept
father
said
betty
softly
why
do
ye
speak
to
me
dearie
dearie
scud
i
saved
ye
hai
ye
nothing
to
say
to
me
scud
you
better
go
into
the
house
said
some
one
leave
scud
to
us
awhile
for
in
truth
not
a
man
or
woman
of
us
but
believed
that
scud
was
dead
you
jess
get
us
to
a
kitchen
fire
said
betty
quietly
and
leave
him
to
and
it
was
repeated
with
many
a
trembling
lip
far
down
the
coast
that
night
that
scud
would
live
it
was
the
morning
of
my
departure
and
it
had
come
by
the
last
express
the
night
before
it
had
been
kept
a
profound
secret
for
we
would
not
risk
a
cruel
disappointment
scud
had
rowed
to
town
with
a
full
fare
of
fish
and
salt
was
with
him
doing
the
rowing
we
left
word
that
they
should
come
to
the
house
as
soon
as
they
had
put
up
their
dory
a
peremptory
message
was
sent
to
betty
to
come
over
immediately
to
do
some
work
a
few
neighbors
happened
to
drop
in
there
might
have
been
a
dozen
or
so
in
all
my
cousin
did
not
go
into
town
that
day
he
said
he
wanted
to
see
me
off
betty
came
a
little
early
and
was
set
to
scrubbing
the
pantry
floor
but
scud
a
hero
he
had
forgotten
all
about
it
now
he
was
the
same
old
fellow
just
as
easy
just
as
jolly
just
as
careless
scud
was
at
all
spoiled
by
what
had
happened
he
was
as
comfortable
as
the
sea
this
very
morning
who
would
have
suspected
the
passing
of
a
grand
storm
upon
the
hearts
of
either
scud
sluggish
blood
had
been
up
for
one
fiery
hour
for
one
great
day
he
had
been
the
hero
of
the
coast
the
peer
of
all
its
heroes
then
the
fire
went
out
and
scud
became
as
he
was
perhaps
scud
was
more
popular
his
babies
were
better
fed
fishermen
treated
him
with
a
grudged
respect
and
when
he
was
pointed
out
to
every
new
squad
of
boarders
as
the
bravest
man
on
the
whole
coast
they
smiled
how
could
that
grinning
singing
scud
save
a
it
was
just
eleven
with
what
impatience
we
had
waited
for
the
tramp
of
those
rubber
boots
we
rushed
upon
the
piazza
and
greeted
scud
and
salt
dressed
in
their
just
as
they
had
come
from
the
trap
scud
halted
uneasily
at
the
front
door
no
miss
i
ca
come
in
in
this
toggery
i
all
gurry
i
go
home
and
change
my
clothes
could
get
here
sooner
herrin
jess
struck
we
sold
ten
this
mornin
but
we
constrained
him
and
scud
entered
staring
about
shuffling
his
rubber
boots
and
wiping
them
as
best
he
might
white
scales
of
fish
glittered
upon
his
black
he
looked
as
if
he
were
mailed
in
silver
it
devolved
upon
me
to
fetch
betty
from
the
pantry
but
i
saw
as
i
went
that
all
of
the
people
in
the
parlor
stood
up
as
scud
entered
as
if
they
were
greeting
a
prince
scud
looked
from
one
to
the
other
uncomfortably
he
blushed
a
deep
russet
red
and
stared
and
then
laughed
in
a
vacant
way
betty
now
appeared
in
the
doorway
and
the
three
made
a
most
impressive
group
in
their
wondering
what
it
was
all
about
and
what
the
city
folk
were
after
now
scud
said
the
master
of
the
house
clearing
his
throat
you
have
done
the
bravest
deed
this
coast
has
record
of
for
twenty
years
you
have
saved
to
us
our
children
dearer
than
our
life
you
had
your
own
wife
to
think
of
and
the
children
who
depend
upon
you
for
their
bread
you
have
been
a
hero
to
us
you
are
always
a
hero
and
our
love
and
gratitude
will
last
as
long
as
our
days
i
have
the
privilege
of
presenting
to
you
the
highest
tribute
massachusetts
pays
to
her
brave
men
the
gold
medal
of
her
great
humane
society
one
hundred
years
old
this
honor
has
not
been
sought
but
has
been
eagerly
bestowed
may
it
never
leave
your
family
it
will
be
an
inspiration
to
your
boys
you
have
obtained
the
reward
of
your
pluck
and
you
deserve
it
old
fellow
now
shake
the
speech
broke
in
eloquence
but
not
in
feeling
see
said
mabel
i
kiss
the
medal
for
you
and
for
my
dear
sake
she
flashed
it
from
its
plush
case
and
placed
the
solemn
emblem
whose
exquisite
engravings
glittered
like
a
jewel
in
his
great
wet
hands
salt
turned
his
face
to
the
wall
betty
put
her
apron
over
her
face
and
scud
eyes
ran
dripping
over
he
opened
his
mouth
but
no
sound
came
forth
and
now
betty
look
here
said
her
mistress
in
a
gay
tremulous
tone
i
have
something
for
she
held
out
in
her
delicate
hand
forty
silver
dollars
the
gift
of
the
humane
society
to
betty
herself
you
are
a
woman
and
you
saved
a
man
life
explained
my
cousin
and
the
society
always
recognizes
the
courage
of
a
woman
but
betty
drew
herself
up
in
her
scrubbing
dress
she
had
a
fine
look
thank
you
she
said
and
the
gentleman
too
but
he
was
my
husband
i
do
take
no
money
from
nobody
for
savin
of
my
husband
just
as
much
obleeged
to
ye
almost
every
child
in
her
house
was
dressed
in
given
clothes
but
the
unpauperized
soul
looked
out
of
betty
faded
eyes
well
said
my
cousin
looking
nonplussed
how
would
it
do
to
make
it
over
to
the
twins
as
ye
please
said
betty
shining
so
the
four
twin
babies
received
ten
silver
dollars
apiece
from
the
humane
society
for
plunging
into
the
water
and
saving
their
father
life
this
was
an
illegal
procedure
i
grant
it
and
if
the
society
now
for
the
first
time
learneth
of
the
matter
i
am
fain
to
believe
that
it
is
too
old
and
too
great
to
take
account
thereof
we
were
rowing
over
to
catch
my
train
scud
was
the
oarsman
he
sat
quite
still
and
had
a
dazed
look
midway
of
the
bay
he
stopped
pulling
lifted
and
crossed
his
oars
i
saw
his
adam
apple
rising
and
falling
like
an
irresolute
tide
i
were
took
all
of
a
sudden
he
said
slowly
i
never
felt
so
in
all
my
life
my
throat
felt
kinder
queer
an
dry
but
i
mightily
obliged
to
yer
it
might
give
salt
a
lift
but
i
did
know
what
to
say
an
so
i
did
say
nothing
the
romance
of
a
mortgage
court
street
boston
francis
ellesworth
university
club
boston
mass
my
dear
frank
i
am
sorry
to
inform
you
that
the
benson
note
is
still
uncollected
the
party
writes
that
he
will
try
to
pay
it
soon
our
correspondent
in
sunshine
considers
the
benson
security
in
cherokee
as
this
is
the
only
mortgage
that
has
slipped
up
so
far
on
our
hands
i
should
advise
you
to
be
patient
a
few
more
days
perhaps
you
had
better
give
the
party
leeway
up
to
if
necessary
as
it
is
his
first
default
since
you
took
the
papers
three
years
ago
however
if
you
are
impatient
and
wish
to
settle
the
matter
send
me
down
the
trust
deeds
and
notes
run
in
any
time
i
shall
be
glad
to
see
you
very
truly
yours
joseph
todd
young
ellesworth
carefully
deposited
his
cigar
in
the
bronze
ash
receiver
on
the
polished
table
by
his
side
and
pulled
out
from
his
breast
pocket
a
notebook
which
he
consulted
after
a
few
moments
he
seemed
to
satisfy
himself
as
to
the
identity
of
his
mortgager
benson
put
his
papers
up
and
sank
back
into
a
reverie
the
gray
november
day
seemed
to
have
contented
itself
with
monopolizing
the
streets
and
the
faded
common
and
the
poor
tenements
and
the
ragged
stragglers
and
to
have
passed
by
the
windows
of
beacon
street
and
the
luxurious
of
the
new
university
club
francis
ellesworth
sprawled
listlessly
in
the
deep
chair
by
the
window
and
vaguely
congratulated
himself
that
he
did
not
have
to
earn
his
supper
it
was
lucky
that
he
did
not
have
to
for
any
tyro
of
a
physiognomist
could
have
seen
at
a
glance
that
the
delicate
features
the
sallow
complexion
brightened
by
red
spots
upon
his
cheeks
the
gentle
black
eyes
and
the
straight
black
hair
did
not
belong
to
a
robust
new
england
body
the
trouble
with
ellesworth
was
not
that
he
was
rich
enough
not
to
have
to
work
but
that
he
was
born
at
all
he
considered
it
only
a
fair
compensation
for
this
insult
that
three
years
ago
he
had
fallen
heir
to
thousand
dollars
which
he
had
successfully
invested
and
reinvested
ever
since
this
occupation
and
the
clubs
and
a
few
other
necessary
amusements
formed
his
life
he
was
not
handsome
but
just
interesting
looking
enough
not
to
pass
unnoticed
he
was
not
vulgar
that
is
to
say
he
did
not
drink
too
much
did
not
swear
and
was
not
the
kind
of
a
fellow
who
compromises
a
woman
by
his
attentions
he
was
neither
clever
nor
stupid
thousands
of
young
men
in
our
great
cities
are
of
this
type
unimportant
to
men
of
intent
and
a
missionary
field
to
women
of
character
he
needed
an
electric
shock
either
to
kill
him
or
make
a
man
of
him
but
perhaps
after
all
ellesworth
was
not
wholly
to
blame
for
not
trying
to
make
his
mark
for
he
was
not
so
strong
as
other
men
as
i
said
before
and
had
besides
so
thoroughly
coddled
himself
into
that
belief
that
useful
activity
was
struck
off
of
his
list
of
possibilities
now
it
happened
that
this
benson
mortgage
was
the
first
which
he
had
taken
out
under
his
inheritance
it
had
a
certain
special
interest
to
him
for
that
reason
it
had
netted
him
eight
per
cent
clear
and
he
considered
his
fifteen
hundred
dollars
well
invested
his
harvard
classmate
todd
a
good
judge
had
selected
the
mortgage
for
him
and
altogether
it
seemed
to
the
young
quite
an
important
if
not
to
say
a
public
financial
affair
that
this
first
of
october
passed
without
producing
sixty
dollars
from
benson
he
did
know
who
benson
was
nor
did
he
care
how
many
a
capitalist
in
the
east
knows
the
sturdy
settler
whose
home
he
holds
in
his
relentless
safe
the
drought
comes
the
crops
wither
away
the
cyclone
sweeps
the
land
the
only
horse
that
does
the
ploughing
dies
the
mother
is
sick
and
the
father
tends
the
babies
instead
of
the
wheat
a
hundred
catastrophes
menace
the
farmer
but
whatever
happens
the
dividend
must
be
paid
or
the
nightmare
of
his
life
comes
to
pass
the
terrible
capitalist
in
the
east
less
compassionate
than
the
cyclone
or
the
inundation
or
the
drought
takes
the
home
as
a
matter
of
course
just
as
he
takes
his
dinner
who
would
dare
complain
not
benson
surely
thought
ellesworth
with
the
smile
of
a
man
who
holds
a
full
hand
work
benson
for
all
he
is
worth
wrote
ellesworth
on
some
blue
and
give
him
until
the
first
of
december
the
first
of
december
came
but
no
south
carolina
interest
francis
ellesworth
was
greatly
annoyed
and
told
todd
so
plainly
he
is
sick
explained
todd
somebody
else
wrote
for
him
the
letter
came
the
other
day
but
he
signed
it
he
asks
for
another
fifteen
days
ellesworth
frowned
i
deuced
hard
up
just
now
he
said
christmas
is
coming
on
that
would
just
settle
my
flower
bill
halvin
has
sent
me
three
confoundedly
gentlemanly
bills
that
the
worst
of
it
write
and
tell
benson
give
him
until
the
fifteenth
of
december
not
another
day
just
as
you
say
answered
todd
it
all
safe
enough
but
it
will
take
some
time
to
realize
cherokee
is
exactly
booming
but
he
got
fifty
acres
and
one
half
cleared
the
other
half
is
heavy
yellow
pine
the
timber
is
worth
the
whole
amount
my
correspondent
assures
me
besides
the
house
and
you
wo
lose
not
a
cent
guarantee
but
it
annoying
i
will
admit
then
they
fell
to
talking
about
the
yale
victory
of
course
they
talked
late
and
ellesworth
walked
to
his
apartments
in
a
heavy
shower
that
night
one
of
the
catastrophes
which
prove
demons
or
angels
to
our
lives
occurred
to
the
young
man
he
was
taken
suddenly
and
violently
of
the
three
physicians
summoned
by
the
excited
janitor
to
prescribe
for
the
sickness
one
called
the
case
pneumonia
another
preferred
malaria
and
the
third
having
just
delivered
an
original
paper
on
the
subject
suggested
brain
grippe
in
only
one
respect
the
three
wise
men
agreed
their
patient
must
spend
the
winter
in
the
south
oddly
enough
they
recommended
sunshine
south
carolina
and
as
sunshine
is
a
fashionable
resort
with
plenty
of
hotels
and
tennis
and
girls
ellesworth
found
no
difficulty
in
obeying
the
medical
counsel
thus
in
ten
days
he
found
himself
in
the
land
of
the
palmetto
and
the
japonica
it
was
an
abrupt
change
and
therefore
all
the
more
natural
for
that
the
other
day
an
invalid
started
for
india
on
an
eighteen
hours
notice
ellesworth
illness
and
the
journey
had
entirely
driven
the
benson
matter
out
of
his
mind
he
had
drawn
upon
an
emergency
fund
for
his
trip
and
the
fact
that
he
was
sixty
dollars
short
had
escaped
his
easy
memory
therefore
the
further
announcement
from
todd
that
benson
could
not
pay
at
the
date
agreed
upon
came
to
him
as
a
new
shock
todd
had
written
a
formal
letter
to
his
classmate
merely
stating
the
fact
and
asking
for
instructions
as
ellesworth
read
it
he
had
a
vague
feeling
that
there
was
something
behind
that
was
not
told
but
he
had
just
lost
a
game
of
billiards
to
an
inferior
player
and
felt
cross
confound
that
benson
he
ejaculated
then
he
sat
down
and
wrote
foreclose
at
once
my
attorneys
squeeze
claw
will
give
you
the
benson
trust
deeds
on
presentation
of
this
hurry
it
through
as
soon
as
you
can
he
heaved
a
sigh
of
relief
and
lighted
a
cigar
with
todd
letter
there
are
critics
who
assert
that
the
modern
story
fails
of
its
mission
unless
it
deals
in
extraordinary
characters
embedded
like
the
rare
crystals
of
hiddenite
in
an
extraordinary
matrix
and
that
the
public
tired
to
suffocation
of
its
own
commonplaces
has
a
right
to
expect
something
out
of
the
usual
run
if
such
a
were
final
francis
ellesworth
is
in
nowise
a
fit
hero
for
a
nor
was
it
even
an
extraordinary
circumstance
that
made
him
inquire
how
far
cherokee
garden
was
from
sunshine
you
can
go
by
railroad
answered
the
northern
clerk
or
you
can
go
horseback
it
only
eight
miles
by
road
through
the
pines
it
a
very
pretty
ride
to
take
before
dinner
ellesworth
had
two
reasons
for
amusing
himself
by
an
easy
trip
to
cherokee
he
had
a
vague
feeling
of
remorse
which
often
follows
the
decree
of
justice
lincoln
was
made
ill
by
being
obliged
to
refuse
a
pardon
the
greater
the
power
the
heavier
it
hangs
upon
the
heart
ellesworth
as
he
entertained
himself
in
the
conventional
way
ever
spending
never
earning
began
to
feel
that
he
had
done
a
brutal
thing
without
even
looking
into
the
circumstances
to
order
a
man
home
sold
over
his
head
because
he
had
failed
to
pay
interest
for
the
first
time
if
benson
farm
were
only
eight
miles
away
why
did
he
not
see
him
before
he
sent
the
command
to
foreclose
there
was
an
atonement
owing
and
this
feeling
rising
like
a
mist
in
the
mind
of
the
young
man
who
knew
much
of
pleasure
and
little
of
misery
drew
him
to
the
mortgaged
plantation
and
then
if
benson
did
prove
a
shiftless
fellow
he
wanted
to
see
what
kind
of
a
place
he
might
be
soon
forced
to
own
he
might
make
it
his
winter
resort
and
come
down
there
every
year
the
more
selfish
thought
reinforced
the
generous
one
and
piqued
his
curiosity
as
he
rode
slowly
into
the
wilderness
leaving
sunshine
and
its
fashionable
savor
behind
it
was
a
december
morning
to
one
not
used
to
the
tropics
the
sun
the
heat
the
greenness
the
exhilaration
were
magical
under
what
cold
comforter
was
boston
common
shivering
on
this
winter
day
what
pneumonic
gales
roared
up
beacon
street
and
gnashed
through
commonwealth
avenue
seeking
whom
they
might
devour
and
having
not
a
great
way
to
go
how
blue
the
street
vendors
looked
the
italian
boys
who
gilded
statuettes
on
tremont
street
and
the
man
under
the
old
courthouse
who
offers
to
clean
your
gloves
of
the
unpardonable
sin
for
five
cents
how
the
fellows
shivered
as
they
stamped
the
snow
off
in
the
club
vestibule
the
wonder
that
new
england
is
not
depopulated
when
there
is
such
an
eden
in
which
to
spend
the
devastating
winter
so
ellesworth
thought
as
he
jogged
along
the
uneven
sandy
road
congratulating
himself
with
every
deep
breath
and
sitting
straight
and
straighter
in
the
saddle
he
had
never
felt
so
happy
and
so
free
as
he
did
this
december
morning
passing
slowly
by
a
deserted
orchard
he
could
see
the
yellow
larks
flying
from
tree
to
tree
and
could
hear
the
robins
and
the
calling
each
other
names
and
mocking
each
other
merrily
now
and
then
he
stopped
his
horse
to
watch
a
couple
of
quails
leisurely
hopping
across
the
road
and
strained
his
ears
to
hear
their
thrum
as
they
were
startled
in
the
thicket
the
very
air
seemed
happy
care
and
illness
slipped
away
as
the
sunshine
slipped
on
the
faces
of
the
leaves
it
was
december
no
it
was
summer
with
something
thrown
in
that
is
never
present
in
our
northern
june
ellesworth
galloped
along
until
his
horse
stumbled
into
a
before
him
in
a
hollow
a
stream
had
to
be
forded
in
the
usual
southern
way
above
and
beyond
a
cabin
could
be
seen
from
whose
outside
chimney
smoke
arose
in
a
perpendicular
column
cocks
crew
in
the
distance
and
there
was
every
indication
that
the
outskirts
of
cherokee
were
represented
in
the
hut
before
him
as
ellesworth
halted
in
the
deepest
part
of
the
brook
allowing
his
horse
to
drink
he
saw
clusters
of
mistletoe
on
the
tops
of
slender
trees
the
dark
green
of
this
romantic
parasite
set
against
the
gray
of
the
trees
and
their
moss
formed
a
new
picture
for
the
northerner
the
glistening
mistletoe
with
its
white
berries
recalled
scenes
that
he
had
read
about
ellesworth
had
played
too
lightly
with
life
to
have
ever
been
seriously
in
love
the
flirtation
of
a
few
weeks
or
months
and
the
solemn
tenderness
of
devoted
love
are
not
allied
the
one
passes
into
the
other
as
seldom
as
silicon
passes
into
the
cells
of
a
fallen
tree
ellesworth
had
never
gone
beyond
conventional
devotion
and
this
he
had
so
far
discreetly
given
to
married
women
this
emblem
of
christmas
troth
actually
growing
before
his
eyes
and
seen
by
him
in
its
native
state
for
the
first
time
produced
a
vague
longing
upon
the
young
new
englander
he
remembered
a
precise
and
beautiful
boston
girl
rich
enough
and
all
that
whom
he
had
vainly
tried
to
consider
in
the
light
of
a
possible
wife
what
surprise
would
she
have
poured
upon
him
if
he
had
attempted
to
claim
the
right
of
the
mistletoe
branch
he
had
waited
in
order
to
give
and
receive
spontaneous
unconventional
tokens
of
affection
he
had
dreamed
of
walking
in
the
fields
by
the
side
of
the
phantom
he
loved
clasping
her
hand
and
swinging
it
with
his
just
like
children
in
arcadia
he
wanted
no
wife
who
would
accept
her
husband
kiss
as
a
matter
of
necessity
he
had
seen
them
and
cynically
watched
the
husband
casting
furtive
longing
looks
at
her
who
swore
to
cherish
him
unto
death
thus
spoke
the
chaste
the
alluring
mistletoe
to
his
heart
these
thoughts
surprised
him
and
he
hurried
along
in
vague
discomfort
over
the
little
slope
the
natives
called
it
a
hill
and
up
to
the
straggling
village
called
in
his
papers
of
description
cherokee
garden
for
no
earthly
reason
whatever
is
this
cherokee
garden
he
asked
of
the
wrinkled
white
woman
sitting
in
the
doorway
of
the
solitary
suburban
residence
this
ai
the
hull
of
it
young
man
she
answered
severely
taking
her
pipe
out
of
her
mouth
and
looking
at
ellesworth
as
if
he
had
cast
an
aspersion
upon
a
city
ye
kin
ride
down
the
road
a
right
smart
bit
until
ye
come
to
the
kyars
the
post
office
is
on
the
other
side
o
the
track
this
she
said
with
an
accent
of
resentment
do
you
know
where
a
man
called
william
benson
lives
whom
i
understand
has
a
a
farm
here
somewhere
when
ellesworth
had
finished
his
question
the
old
woman
got
up
and
supported
by
her
stick
tottered
to
his
side
and
peered
up
into
his
face
air
ye
any
kin
ter
bill
benson
air
ye
to
him
no
no
stammered
ellesworth
taken
aback
i
only
wanted
to
call
on
him
why
ye
go
right
smart
ways
to
find
bill
benson
replied
the
old
woman
grimly
she
peered
up
into
his
face
again
and
shook
her
head
ellesworth
wondering
whether
his
creditor
had
skipped
to
cuba
to
avoid
payment
awaited
information
bill
benson
she
stopped
to
take
a
whiff
and
then
proceeded
with
a
tone
of
awe
caught
from
methodist
preachers
hez
gone
to
glory
where
asked
boston
ignorant
of
the
longitude
and
latitude
of
that
strange
place
to
glory
young
man
repeated
the
old
woman
impressively
elder
jones
buried
bill
in
tantallon
buryin
ground
four
mile
from
hyar
down
the
track
added
the
woman
severely
her
voice
dropped
to
a
whisper
on
the
last
words
and
she
looked
to
see
their
effect
upon
the
horseman
the
red
handkerchief
tied
over
her
head
and
under
her
chin
had
fallen
down
behind
her
neck
and
revealed
a
bald
head
the
cock
crew
from
the
step
of
the
hut
benson
dead
this
then
accounted
for
the
note
so
long
overdue
benson
had
been
sick
and
could
not
pay
why
had
ellesworth
not
known
this
before
he
reddened
with
this
was
the
first
tragedy
which
he
had
stumbled
upon
and
how
much
of
it
was
his
own
doing
the
old
woman
looked
at
him
suspiciously
when
did
he
die
he
asked
softly
the
woman
counted
backwards
on
her
fingers
with
the
stem
of
her
pipe
right
smart
onto
two
weeks
she
answered
after
much
calculation
then
she
shot
this
question
at
him
with
a
scowl
ye
hai
no
northerner
air
ye
taken
off
his
guard
ellesworth
hesitated
and
then
forswore
his
section
i
i
am
living
at
eh
sunshine
her
face
lighted
mebbe
raised
in
charleston
ye
look
like
a
south
carolinian
ellesworth
was
drawn
to
it
by
some
occult
power
and
nodded
assent
the
old
woman
manner
was
now
totally
different
and
she
approached
him
confidentially
and
offered
him
the
use
of
her
tin
which
he
courteously
declined
ye
haint
heerd
so
colonel
tom
garvin
told
me
that

he

if
he
tries
to
take

from

poor
innercent
thing
that
she
is
the
old
woman
cracked
voice
thrilled
with
the
passion
and
tenderness
of
her
kind
but
ellesworth
did
not
look
at
her
as
she
finished
he
felt
a
little
frightened
and
he
bent
over
his
horse
to
fleck
a
bit
of
bark
with
his
whip
to
conceal
it
how
far
do
they
live
from
here
he
asked
after
a
pause
which
she
interpreted
as
actuated
by
sympathy
no
fur
at
all
ye
take
the
next
turn
to
yer
left
it
the
first
plantation
ye
come
to
i
reckon
ye
see
georgy
a
dustin
and
sweepin
she
almighty
pertikler
she
is
poor
creetur
ellesworth
thanked
the
old
woman
dreamily
and
rode
in
the
direction
which
she
pointed
out
ellesworth
had
never
thought
of
this
view
of
the
subject
it
never
occurred
to
him
that
he
would
be
an
object
of
hatred
in
cherokee
garden
he
glanced
around
furtively
as
if
he
expected
to
see
an
enemy
hiding
behind
the
trees
at
any
rate
so
far
he
was
not
known
he
made
up
his
mind
that
he
should
not
be
benson
daughter
was
undoubtedly
a
sallow
withered
young
girl
with
a
hot
temper
and
a
deep
sense
of
injury
and
if
she
found
out
his
identity
would
probably
call
the
country
to
arms
against
him
but
the
yankee
had
no
idea
of
giving
up
his
rights
his
hands
tightened
on
reins
and
whip
he
meant
to
see
the
plantation
that
was
mortgaged
in
his
name
at
any
cost
but
about
one
thing
he
was
now
certain
cherokee
would
never
be
a
winter
resort
for
him
he
walked
his
horse
to
the
to
the
left
about
a
thousand
yards
or
so
until
he
came
in
front
of
a
house
he
halted
and
looked
at
it
long
and
critically
it
was
a
house
built
of
yellow
pine
that
had
not
been
painted
in
spite
of
this
it
did
not
look
neglected
it
had
an
air
of
scrupulous
neatness
and
care
around
the
house
ran
a
simple
fence
made
to
keep
the
chickens
and
the
pigs
that
swarmed
about
him
from
the
garden
and
the
piazza
a
huge
covered
one
whole
side
of
the
house
while
in
the
garden
and
on
the
veranda
red
and
white
japonicas
were
in
flower
flanking
the
walk
from
the
gate
to
the
house
high
azalea
bushes
were
pushing
forth
their
buds
for
the
spring
blooming
and
little
borders
of
box
protected
with
wooden
boards
and
bunches
of
holly
intersected
the
little
garden
it
was
more
than
a
looking
place
it
was
fascinatingly
cozy
with
its
roses
and
camellias
and
azaleas
and
a
single
protecting
palmetto
and
live
oaks
and
majestic
pines
it
was
just
the
place
ellesworth
had
dreamed
of
possessing
it
was
luxuriant
it
was
tropical
the
air
with
odors
of
gum
and
blooms
mounted
to
his
brain
like
a
narcotic
he
sat
upon
his
horse
and
looked
about
his
eyes
roamed
past
the
house
and
caught
the
contrast
of
the
unkempt
fields
with
the
neatness
within
the
enclosure
he
noted
the
olive
fingers
of
the
high
pines
beyond
the
ploughed
land
it
was
a
fair
and
a
sad
sight
william
benson
was
not
there
to
enjoy
his
home
with
a
sigh
of
longing
and
of
he
turned
his
face
toward
the
house
again
before
him
with
one
hand
on
the
gate
stood
a
woman
she
was
looking
at
him
questions
were
in
her
eyes
ellesworth
stared
at
her
in
amazement
and
only
superlatives
crowded
into
his
mind
for
she
was
the
most
glorious
woman
he
had
ever
seen
she
was
tall
almost
to
his
own
height
and
with
a
proportional
figure
dressed
without
ornament
without
ruffle
or
frill
or
white
at
the
throat
in
plain
black
her
face
revealed
itself
on
the
green
background
as
if
it
were
upon
a
canvas
by
bastien
lepage
it
was
a
face
in
which
there
seemed
to
be
many
nationalities
blended
italian
eyes
spanish
coloring
of
the
cheeks
black
indian
hair
rich
mexican
lips
these
coördinated
into
the
most
startling
type
he
had
ever
seen
through
a
quick
sensitive
intelligence
the
inheritance
of
southern
blood
he
could
not
analyze
this
beauty
he
could
only
gasp
at
it
francis
ellesworth
was
as
has
been
intimated
not
a
captivating
man
but
as
he
sat
upon
his
horse
with
the
flush
of
excitement
upon
his
face
and
a
certain
refinement
in
his
carriage
that
looked
as
much
out
of
place
in
cherokee
garden
as
the
face
of
the
girl
before
him
he
was
not
an
unattractive
fellow
now
as
the
two
were
not
over
fifteen
feet
apart
and
were
both
looking
at
each
other
one
of
them
had
to
speak
she
waited
for
him
to
do
so
he
simply
could
so
she
spoke
first
have
you
lost
your
way
sir
the
tremor
of
the
dimple
in
her
chin
and
the
marked
effort
which
she
made
to
steady
her
voice
showed
that
she
was
much
agitated
had
she
not
been
expecting
the
man
who
was
to
take
away
her
home
for
a
paltry
sum
of
unpaid
money
she
had
looked
upon
the
yankee
who
held
her
fathers
notes
as
little
more
than
a
thief
and
now
that
her
father
had
died
she
seriously
considered
him
in
the
light
of
a
murderer
she
thought
of
his
agent
as
his
minion
whom
it
was
clearly
due
her
dignity
to
resist
the
case
had
been
the
talk
of
the
scraggly
village
and
the
judge
of
the
district
who
was
reputed
to
know
the
intricacies
of
all
the
law
that
ever
was
tabulated
asserted
vehemently
in
her
presence
that
to
eject
her
from
her
home
was
an
outrage
that
could
not
and
would
not
be
permitted
as
long
as
the
men
of
cherokee
could
carry
a
gun
this
testimony
of
southern
chivalry
the
girl
fully
believed
and
now
the
invader
had
come
at
last
she
clutched
the
gate
and
collected
herself
to
meet
him
no
miss
that
is
is
this
william
benson
i
mean
ellesworth
halted
remembering
that
his
debtor
was
no
more
and
not
wishing
to
remind
her
of
the
fact
this
his
place
the
magnificent
girl
looked
at
him
over
that
fence
and
measured
him
yes
the
worst
had
come
at
last
and
an
insult
with
it
how
the
stranger
gloated
over
the
fact
that
the
place
was
her
father
she
drew
herself
to
her
full
height
her
black
eyes
blazed
her
cheeks
became
carmine
she
could
hardly
control
her
voice
from
indignation
you
mistake
sir
this
his
place
and
i
think
sir
it
will
remain
so
she
looked
at
him
fiercely
and
waited
to
let
that
sentiment
fructify
in
the
young
man
soul
indeed
i
i
hope
so
ventured
ellesworth
disregarding
this
as
a
feeble
attempt
at
apology
she
asked
what
is
your
name
sir
do
you
come
from
or
are
you
the
contempt
which
she
cast
into
the
personal
pronouns
had
a
marked
effect
upon
ellesworth
the
mere
fact
that
a
woman
for
whom
at
first
sight
he
felt
a
greater
admiration
than
he
had
ever
bestowed
elsewhere
should
be
so
antagonistic
to
him
at
the
start
made
his
heart
contract
within
him
yet
he
managed
to
pull
himself
together
and
say
with
admirable
feint
excuse
me
you
must
labor
under
a
mistake
i
am
a
total
stranger
here
i
am
eh
merely
looking
about
i
am
staying
at
sunshine
for
my
health
he
noted
with
satisfaction
a
look
of
relief
stealing
over
her
face
and
a
slight
touch
of
spontaneous
sympathy
too
at
his
last
statement
ellesworth
immediately
followed
the
lead
up
yes
he
said
i
am
an
invalid
and
was
ordered
south
for
my
lungs
i
have
heard
so
much
about
southern
hospitality
would
it
be
asking
too
much
for
me
to
rest
here
awhile
i
am
a
trifle
tired
after
this
long
ride
he
heaved
a
sigh
and
tried
to
look
utterly
fagged
out
as
he
noticed
how
admirably
that
tack
succeeded
oh
i
beg
your
pardon
sir
said
the
girl
impulsively
i
thought
you
were
a
lawyer
or
a
sheriff
or
perhaps
a
man
from
she
could
hardly
pronounce
the
name
of
the
cultured
city
it
stuck
in
her
throat
i
he
asked
in
a
tone
of
reproach
not
at
all
he
answered
laughing
i
told
you
that
i
have
come
from
sunshine
he
added
blandly
the
girl
taking
his
negative
as
a
reply
to
all
her
doubts
now
opened
the
gate
hospitably
forgive
my
rudeness
sir
and
come
in
and
sit
awhile
she
said
as
prettily
as
a
woman
could
i
ask
aunt
mccorkle
to
get
you
something
would
you
take
a
glass
of
milk
she
blushed
as
she
remembered
her
empty
wine
cellar
with
a
languid
air
which
he
could
hardly
maintain
so
boisterously
the
blood
surged
through
his
veins
ellesworth
walked
up
to
the
piazza
and
sat
down
he
looked
about
him
in
a
bewildered
way
the
passionless
white
camellia
blooming
by
his
side
seemed
singularly
out
of
place
he
thought
of
the
intoxicating
jacqueminot
roses
he
used
to
order
at
halvin
for
that
chilly
boston
girl
he
tried
to
love
and
could
the
red
camellia
had
more
of
this
splendid
southern
creature
color
but
that
too
with
its
waxen
expressionless
petals
had
no
business
there
either
it
exasperated
him
it
looked
at
him
coolly
and
sarcastically
as
if
that
which
happens
to
a
man
but
once
in
his
life
had
not
come
to
him
aunt
mccorkle
appeared
with
the
glass
of
milk
she
was
a
vague
southern
gentlewoman
gentle
and
faded
and
appealing
she
was
just
what
he
expected
the
daughter
of
william
benson
to
be
he
thought
of
the
and
elderly
boston
dames
with
their
strong
profiles
and
keen
eyes
and
decisive
opinions
of
reforms
and
literature
and
charity
any
one
of
them
might
have
put
out
her
arms
and
have
taken
mccorkle
up
in
her
lap
and
trotted
her
to
sleep
yet
ellesworth
liked
the
southern
lady
already
he
felt
a
queer
movement
of
the
heart
toward
georgiella
benson
relations
is
it
lung
trouble
inquired
aunt
mccorkle
sympathetically
the
girl
came
out
of
the
house
at
this
moment
and
sat
down
on
the
veranda
under
the
white
camellia
she
glanced
at
her
guest
with
interest
the
doctors
think
i
shall
come
out
all
right
if
i
am
careful
of
my
self
replied
ellesworth
evasively
it
is
hard
to
be
sick
said
georgiella
sincerely
illness
and
death
had
touched
her
so
lately
and
so
cruelly
that
she
could
not
help
feeling
sorry
for
the
sick
young
man
i
have
just
ridden
over
from
sunshine
where
i
am
living
now
explained
ellesworth
again
although
his
conscience
gave
him
a
twinge
he
hurried
on
you
see
i
looking
for
a
quiet
place
to
board
in
he
made
a
diplomatic
pause
the
sunshine
hotel
is
too
noisy
what
with
billiards
and
bowling
and
late
dances
so
i
rode
over
here
to
look
about
and
an
old
lady
with
a
pipe
told
me
you
lived
here
that
was
aunt
betsey
said
the
girl
decisively
but
we
never
took
boarders
with
a
stately
drawing
up
of
her
head
why
should
she
send
you
here
my
dear
protested
mccorkle
mildly
the
randolphs
of
sunshine
took
boarders
last
winter
and
i
suppose
we
could
get
aunt
betsey
to
cook
she
rose
to
carry
away
ellesworth
glass
and
beckoned
to
the
girl
to
follow
her
evidently
the
two
poor
ladies
whispered
together
in
the
hall
consulting
upon
the
awful
problem
suddenly
presented
to
their
empty
pockets
and
plethoric
pride
they
came
out
on
the
veranda
again
and
mccorkle
asked
him
point
blank
what
his
name
was
without
perceptible
hesitation
he
replied
bigelow
madam
frank
bigelow
the
unimagined
value
of
a
middle
name
suddenly
presented
itself
to
the
young
man
mind
and
his
conscience
slipped
behind
the
camellias
and
made
no
protest
a
very
irreligious
baby
black
in
the
face
from
howling
had
been
indeed
baptized
francis
bigelow
in
king
chapel
years
ago
and
had
since
bought
a
mortgage
on
the
benson
property
could
you
take
me
it
a
case
of
charity
he
pleaded
turning
to
the
girl
beside
him
it
so
noisy
at
the
hotel
i
ca
sleep
this
last
shot
went
straight
to
the
mark
sympathy
and
need
are
powerful
partners
and
they
worked
together
for
ellesworth
case
in
the
hearts
of
the
two
poor
lonely
women
it
is
only
in
the
south
that
one
can
find
women
ladies
and
who
dress
like
ladies
and
who
hardly
have
ten
dollars
in
cash
the
year
round
the
mystery
of
the
maintenance
of
their
existence
is
not
solved
outside
the
walls
of
their
own
homes
proud
refined
and
shy
they
divulge
nothing
who
is
a
boarder
that
he
should
think
to
comprehend
the
pathetic
ingenuity
of
their
eventless
lives
are
you
connected
with
the
bigelows
of
charleston
asked
mccorkle
softly
i
think
we
must
be
another
branch
replied
ellesworth
boldly
i
will
i
would
pay
you
added
ellesworth
blushing
just
what
they
would
charge
me
at
the
sunshine
hotel
if
that
would
be
satisfactory
how
much
is
that
mr
bigelow
inquired
mccorkle
reddening
too
dollars
a
week
that
is
too
much
we
should
think
that
enough
for
a
month
said
the
girl
turning
her
wonderful
face
upon
her
visitor
i
could
not
think
of
giving
less
he
insisted
still
he
did
not
look
at
her
perhaps
admitted
mccorkle
with
a
sigh
we
might
take
you
sir
seeing
that
you
are
one
of
the
bigelow
family
on
trial
i
will
come
returned
ellesworth
quickly
looking
straight
at
georgiella
i
will
come
next
monday
on
trial
you
wo
look
upon
me
as
a
sheriff
will
you
he
added
as
he
mounted
at
the
gate
to
ride
back
to
his
hotel
the
girl
shook
her
head
as
he
looked
down
at
her
quizzically
that
was
very
stupid
of
me
my
mind
has
been
full
of
my
trouble
i
have
dreamed
about
it
and
hate
the
man
who
holds
that
mortgage
please
do
not
think
of
it
any
more
and
when
you
come
sir
perhaps
you
can
advise
us
what
to
do
ellesworth
looked
at
her
gravely
what
would
the
following
week
and
the
next
and
the
winter
bring
forth
perhaps
he
said
in
a
whisper
that
might
have
come
from
the
delphian
oracle
and
then
he
cantered
away
for
the
first
time
since
her
father
death
georgiella
sang
that
afternoon
as
she
walked
about
the
garden
teasing
her
plants
to
bloom
it
was
monday
the
fifteenth
of
december
mccorkle
ushered
ellesworth
upstairs
into
his
own
room
in
the
cottage
mortgaged
in
his
own
name
the
sun
poured
into
it
like
a
living
blessing
the
enveloped
the
windows
and
when
the
sash
was
raised
delicate
tendrils
insinuated
themselves
within
as
if
in
southern
fashion
they
would
shake
howdy
the
room
was
dainty
and
it
flashed
across
ellesworth
as
he
sank
into
the
cushioned
with
a
long
breath
of
content
that
it
might
have
been
georgiella
it
was
in
the
dreamy
part
of
the
day
the
sun
was
dipping
under
the
high
branches
of
the
pines
then
the
luxury
of
leaning
out
of
the
window
in
december
he
could
not
help
but
think
of
it
as
sun
and
garden
and
trees
and
now
georgiella
came
out
bareheaded
and
swept
the
pine
needles
and
leaves
from
the
narrow
path
and
snipped
dead
branches
from
the
shrubs
and
then
before
she
went
to
feed
the
chickens
she
cast
up
at
him
a
shy
glance
that
made
his
heart
leap
within
him
he
did
not
leave
his
room
until
he
was
called
to
supper
his
fancy
was
feverish
and
kept
picturing
his
mortgaged
girl
in
a
boston
thrilling
all
the
people
he
knew
with
her
beauty
he
called
it
carmine
beauty
but
he
was
young
and
ardent
he
felt
it
when
he
first
saw
her
but
that
eventful
afternoon
he
formulated
it
and
repeated
it
over
and
over
again
until
he
became
dizzy
i
love
her
i
love
her
and
then
visions
of
work
and
strength
and
success
and
ambitions
that
had
been
stifled
began
to
spring
within
him
like
blades
from
watered
bulbs
the
electric
shock
had
come
he
knew
it
he
meant
to
spring
to
it
like
a
man
dreamily
he
dressed
for
supper
and
dreamily
descended
mccorkle
greeted
him
with
her
fine
thin
manner
the
young
man
looked
about
him
curiously
aunt
betsey
waited
on
the
table
he
tried
not
to
think
of
her
hospitality
in
the
matter
of
snuff
the
room
was
worn
and
bare
and
gray
so
bereft
of
all
but
the
most
necessary
furniture
that
its
few
ornaments
had
a
startling
conspicuousness
he
noticed
a
fat
chinese
vase
set
up
like
an
idol
in
an
old
escritoire
over
the
mantel
was
a
religiously
protecting
some
coins
and
ancient
papers
a
rusty
sword
hung
on
the
wall
biographies
of
lee
and
jackson
flanking
the
chinese
fat
vase
in
the
dilapidated
escritoire
and
a
villainous
crayon
framed
in
immortelles
upon
the
wall
that
probably
represented
his
deceased
debtor
completed
the
ornamentation
of
the
room
miss
benson
entered
when
he
had
gone
as
far
as
this
and
vivaciously
exhibited
the
of
the
room
this
is
a
ming
she
pointed
to
the
fat
vase
i
understand
there
another
like
it
in
the
country
it
belongs
to
the
ming
dynasty
although
from
boston
ellesworth
was
not
familiar
with
the
ming
dynasty
but
he
bowed
and
feebly
ejaculated
ah
this
is
a
real
ming
is
it
and
there
said
the
young
lady
bringing
him
before
the
are
family
possessions
that
is
a
coin
of
george
ii
those
are
shillings
those
yellow
papers
are
two
copies
of
a
continental
newspaper
and
this
is
the
south
carolinian
continental
penny
ellesworth
inspected
the
treasures
gravely
he
did
his
best
not
to
smile
very
remarkable
he
murmured
how
southern
he
thought
colonel
tom
garvin
says
there
are
nothing
like
them
in
the
country
i
suppose
they
would
bring
a
great
deal
if
sold
she
added
wistfully
but
we
do
like
to
sell
them
besides
we
never
saw
anybody
who
wanted
to
buy
them
acquaintance
under
one
roof
passes
quickly
into
intimacy
love
moves
with
fleet
feet
when
two
young
people
breakfast
and
dine
together
with
a
vague
chaperone
a
tropical
garden
soft
evenings
and
youthful
impetuosity
shorten
the
span
to
experience
thought
necessary
to
precede
an
engagement
georgiella
was
the
soul
of
domestic
comfort
as
southern
women
are
she
was
a
variable
bewitching
creature
at
first
the
northerner
could
not
understand
her
indifference
to
her
obligations
as
a
mortgager
why
did
she
not
sell
the
ming
vase
she
looked
upon
debt
not
as
a
disgrace
but
as
an
inconvenience
foreclosure
proceedings
were
under
way
and
it
never
occurred
to
the
two
women
to
stop
them
with
even
a
part
of
the
fifty
dollars
which
ellesworth
paid
for
his
board
in
advance
when
ellesworth
found
out
that
this
trait
was
not
a
pauper
but
like
georgiella
strange
beauty
constitutional
he
forbore
to
criticise
it
in
truth
he
was
too
much
in
love
now
to
criticise
the
girl
at
all
it
is
probable
that
if
she
had
robbed
his
pocketbook
he
would
have
merely
said
how
interesting
it
is
her
tropical
way
a
day
or
two
before
christmas
he
drove
over
to
sunshine
and
returned
with
a
happy
tired
face
you
would
take
a
christmas
present
from
me
would
you
he
asked
with
unprecedented
humility
it
in
a
paper
he
explained
what
is
it
she
asked
uncomfortably
for
she
felt
his
serious
look
upon
her
it
eh
a
trifle
that
i
think
you
will
like
replied
ellesworth
without
a
smile
christmas
came
cheerfully
into
the
mortgaged
house
georgiella
cried
a
little
for
her
father
sake
in
spite
of
her
bereavement
and
of
the
fact
that
she
was
sure
the
sheriff
would
attach
the
house
that
day
of
all
others
she
did
not
feel
very
wretched
she
felt
that
she
was
wicked
because
she
was
so
happy
there
were
wings
in
her
heart
it
was
not
the
custom
to
hang
up
stockings
at
the
benson
my
things
have
always
been
put
into
the
ming
vase
georgiella
explained
and
the
others
went
on
the
breakfast
table
she
did
not
look
at
ellesworth
often
her
eyes
dropped
her
cheeks
were
like
red
camellias
she
felt
in
a
hurry
all
of
the
time
the
young
man
himself
took
the
situation
out
in
looking
at
his
watch
it
seemed
to
him
as
if
the
world
were
turning
over
too
fast
he
thought
of
what
he
meant
to
do
stolidly
notwithstanding
they
went
out
and
gathered
mistletoe
in
the
swamps
he
climbed
trees
and
tore
his
hands
and
fell
into
the
water
with
zest
they
brought
home
a
barrelful
of
it
he
thought
how
he
had
bought
it
at
cents
a
spray
on
washington
street
he
held
a
great
branch
of
it
behind
georgiella
over
her
head
and
looked
at
her
she
started
like
a
wild
animal
and
kept
ahead
of
him
all
the
way
home
on
christmas
morning
ellesworth
got
up
early
he
had
hardly
slept
he
could
not
rest
and
went
softly
downstairs
the
door
into
the
was
open
and
she
was
there
before
him
she
stood
before
the
ming
vase
the
mistletoe
branch
to
which
he
had
fastened
his
present
and
which
he
had
set
into
the
vase
to
look
like
a
little
christmas
tree
lay
tossed
beneath
her
feet
the
pearly
white
berries
were
scattered
on
the
floor
the
mortgage
was
in
her
hand
trust
deeds
principal
notes
interest
notes
insurance
policy
she
was
turning
the
papers
over
helplessly
she
looked
scared
and
was
quite
pale
her
bosom
heaved
boisterously
she
heard
him
and
confronted
him
she
managed
to
stammer
out
what
sir
does
this
mean
it
required
a
brave
man
to
tell
her
in
her
present
mood
but
he
did
it
only
means
that
i
love
you
said
ellesworth
point
blank
the
girl
went
from
blinding
white
to
blazing
crimson
but
she
stood
her
ground
the
mortgage
papers
shook
in
her
hands
he
thought
that
she
was
going
to
tear
them
up
to
gain
time
for
he
dared
not
approach
her
he
stooped
and
picked
up
the
disdained
mistletoe
when
he
had
raised
himself
she
shot
out
this
awful
question
looking
at
him
as
she
did
when
they
first
met
are
the
young
man
bowed
his
head
before
her
if
he
had
set
fire
to
her
place
or
robbed
her
father
grave
she
could
not
have
regarded
him
with
a
more
crushing
scorn
she
tried
to
speak
again
but
her
passion
choked
her
i
i
give
you
back
your
home
he
protested
humbly
it
is
mine
no
longer
it
is
your
own
do
blame
me
i
love
you
my
father
did
not
bring
me
up
to
take
valuable
presents
from
boston
gentlemen
blazed
the
southern
girl
she
waved
him
aside
swept
by
him
without
another
look
and
melted
out
of
the
room
but
he
noticed
that
she
took
the
mortgage
papers
with
her
in
the
course
of
the
morning
he
threw
himself
upon
the
mercy
of
mccorkle
i
have
a
right
he
said
i
want
to
make
her
my
wife
georgiella
is
not
behaving
prettily
said
mccorkle
severely
if
a
northerner
act
a
gentleman
the
least
a
southern
girl
can
do
is
to
behave
like
a
lady
i
will
speak
to
georgiella
sir
georgiella
came
to
the
christmas
dinner
with
blazing
eyes
she
ate
in
silence
looking
like
an
offended
goddess
dressed
in
an
old
black
silk
gown
of
her
mother
trimmed
with
aged
valenciennes
lace
but
after
dinner
she
stayed
in
the
while
mccorkle
and
aunt
betsey
went
into
the
kitchen
she
walked
up
to
the
ming
vase
and
stood
before
it
ellesworth
followed
her
i
have
been
thinking
it
over
she
began
abruptly
in
a
quaint
affectation
of
a
tone
i
will
keep
the
mortgage
thank
you
sir
it
my
home
you
know
she
put
in
pugnaciously
but
i
will
pay
for
it
if
you
please
for
it
gasped
ellesworth
yes
sir
i
will
sell
you
the
ming
vase
returned
miss
benson
calmly
and
the
two
revolutionary
papers
and
the
coin
of
george
the
second
and
the
rest
she
waved
her
hand
toward
the
you
may
take
them
to
boston
with
you
these
were
her
assets
ellesworth
looked
at
her
for
a
moment
torn
between
astonishment
pity
amusement
and
love
but
love
got
the
better
of
them
all
and
he
answered
solemnly
yes
i
will
take
the
ming
vase
and
the
revolutionary
papers
and
the
old
coins
and
you
too
my
darling
well
i
like
you
admitted
georgiella
suddenly
she
began
to
droop
and
tremble
and
then
to
sob
then
he
held
her
you
must
give
me
a
first
mortgage
you
must
demanded
the
young
man
i
must
have
everything
the
whole
no
other
claims
to
come
in
from
any
quarter
of
the
universe
you
understand
you
to
be
my
wife
he
exploded
in
a
kind
of
glorious
anger
she
could
not
deny
him
for
she
thought
it
was
the
northern
way
of
wooing
and
smiled
divinely
and
now
may
i
he
took
the
mistletoe
branch
from
the
ming
vase
and
held
it
over
her
head
their
eyes
closed
in
ecstacy
mccorkle
gave
a
funny
little
feminine
scream
of
dismay
she
had
heard
no
sound
and
had
come
in
from
the
kitchen
to
see
if
they
were
quarreling
and
i
put
it
in
the
trust
deed
he
whispered
humbly
that
i
will
make
you
happy
dear
when
ellesworth
rode
over
to
sunshine
for
his
next

he
found
the

yours
truly
joseph
todd
colonel
odminton
a
sequel
to
a
republic
without
a
president
the
colonel
paced
his
cabin
alone
the
new
expression
which
success
models
was
becoming
intensified
from
day
to
day
upon
his
face
he
had
outwitted
the
greatest
nation
in
the
world
he
had
defied
the
best
detective
service
of
modern
times
he
was
rich
beyond
his
dizziest
dreams
he
could
aspire
to
any
position
he
would
be
an
eastern
prince
perhaps
and
girls
should
wave
peacock
fans
and
soothe
his
memory
to
rest
with
crooning
songs
what
a
delicious
future
he
saw
rising
before
him
his
consummate
stroke
of
piracy
should
purchase
him
a
life
of
lotus
ease
the
colonel
had
at
last
achieved
and
as
is
too
often
the
case
with
extraordinary
success
his
stupendous
act
had
robbed
him
of
vitality
and
invention
already
he
felt
and
acknowledged
a
dismemberment
of
his
will
but
a
few
days
before
he
was
of
all
men
the
most
alert
the
most
ingenious
the
most
courageous
the
most
ambitious
while
now
he
lived
in
dreams
which
he
evoked
as
persistently
as
the
witch
of
endor
evoked
the
ghost
of
saul
his
nature
had
undergone
a
revolution
in
which
he
gloried
had
he
been
poor
he
would
not
have
accepted
his
sudden
enervation
without
a
struggle
but
he
was
rich
thank
god
rich
and
rejoiced
that
he
was
to
gratify
his
languor
his
son
alone
had
access
to
his
luxurious
cabin
that
boy
who
had
been
the
ready
and
ignorant
accomplice
of
his
father
picturesque
villainy
had
already
begun
to
grow
thin
with
shame
he
saw
his
father
transformed
from
a
virile
into
a
sleek
man
he
himself
had
changed
during
the
few
days
of
his
knowledge
of
the
secret
from
a
pliant
boy
into
a
silent
accusation
the
colonel
could
not
look
his
son
straight
in
the
eyes
this
was
the
first
warning
to
his
diseased
mind
that
he
was
not
the
greatest
man
of
his
age
the
colonel
had
moreover
a
sense
of
security
that
unapprehended
malefactors
can
not
feel
the
pledge
of
the
united
states
government
had
been
solemnly
given
he
could
not
be
punished
his
freedom
was
assured
whenever
he
paced
the
deck
he
filled
his
lungs
with
the
pure
salt
air
and
allowed
them
to
expand
without
stint
there
was
nothing
contracted
on
his
horizon
true
he
had
lost
his
country
but
he
had
gained
wealth
he
felt
sure
of
admiration
and
of
some
applause
he
remembered
that
an
unextradited
had
purchased
a
barony
from
the
king
of
würtemburg
and
had
lived
there
much
respected
what
position
might
he
not
buy
with
his
american
gold
still
he
was
haunted
by
a
feeling
of
mingled
dissatisfaction
and
unrest
that
marred
the
pride
he
felt
in
his
own
achievement
was
it
due
to
his
son
speechless
denunciation
or
did
it
come
from
the
fact
that
his
authority
seemed
to
be
impaired
there
was
no
insubordination
nor
mutiny
among
the
sailors
it
had
not
gone
so
far
as
that
with
the
and
men
perhaps
it
never
would
but
men
do
not
easily
obey
a
scoundrel
or
an
outlaw
except
when
it
is
understood
that
they
are
felons
themselves
in
a
certain
sense
the
crew
of
the
lightning
rejoiced
in
their
master
superb
feat
the
venom
of
piracy
had
entered
their
veins
they
firmly
believed
that
colonel
odminton
would
soon
cast
off
his
mask
and
turn
the
most
wonderful
product
of
marine
architecture
into
an
irresistible
pirate
craft
they
dreamed
of
an
inaccessible
island
of
confused
wealth
of
many
vices
and
unrestricted
carousals
therefore
they
still
obeyed
readily
but
with
an
air
of
that
puzzled
their
commander
but
colonel
odminton
did
not
suspect
these
natural
speculations
for
he
was
looking
forward
to
a
life
of
great
respectability
as
well
as
of
unrivalled
luxury
for
ten
days
or
so
the
lightning
danced
over
the
atlantic
of
course
it
must
come
to
shore
somewhere
people
can
not
live
on
gold
they
must
eat
the
superb
electric
vessel
had
machines
and
retorts
for
distilling
the
salt
water
into
fresh
but
no
electrodes
were
there
to
reduce
wood
to
sugar
or
coal
to
beef
the
colonel
felt
his
cheek
sting
with
the
excitement
of
coming
to
land
at
the
same
time
he
felt
a
reluctance
to
do
so
he
dreaded
to
meet
men
he
could
not
expel
the
consciousness
that
is
common
to
all
culprits
namely
the
feeling
that
he
would
be
the
centre
of
observation
he
could
not
be
apprehended
but
supposing
that
he
were
not
well
received
on
the
other
hand
when
the
crew
learned
of
the
decision
to
make
for
land
they
were
almost
riotous
with
joy
they
were
mad
for
the
chance
to
spend
their
high
wages
in
vice
and
drink
if
nations
would
conspire
to
pass
an
international
law
to
prohibit
women
and
rum
at
every
port
what
a
magnificent
stride
to
uninterrupted
manhood
all
sailors
would
be
forced
to
take
but
captain
hans
christian
shook
his
head
as
the
lightning
forged
toward
the
land
there
were
some
traits
that
rupert
did
not
inherit
his
limpid
heart
understood
the
disgrace
of
his
position
he
pined
for
freedom
and
gradually
wasted
away
with
feverish
eyes
he
watched
for
the
english
coast
it
is
possible
that
he
had
bereft
of
an
honest
father
meditated
desertion
at
his
first
opportunity
now
at
last
they
sighted
land
the
vessel
that
was
swifter
than
all
other
ships
afloat
was
undisguised
the
colonel
had
no
thought
of
converting
her
into
the
mary
jane
again
no
flight
no
concealment
was
now
necessary
it
was
just
past
sunrise
when
the
lightning
glided
into
the
troubled
harbor
of
penzance
the
inhabitants
of
land
end
are
no
and
when
the
fishermen
who
were
ready
to
push
their
boats
off
in
the
rising
tide
lifted
up
their
eyes
and
beheld
the
graceful
monster
mysteriously
undulating
in
with
no
help
of
sails
or
steam
they
called
to
each
other
they
uttered
direful
exclamations
and
they
assembled
in
ever
increasing
groups
upon
the
sands
one
ran
to
the
public
house
and
brought
back
to
the
throng
a
greasy
proclamation
upon
which
the
picture
of
a
vessel
was
stamped
upon
the
cliffs
pointed
to
the
stranger
and
shook
their
heads
ominously
before
the
lightning
had
dropped
her
anchor
the
whole
population
of
penzance
was
out
gesticulating
pointing
execrating
that
she
sure
enough
that
her
sheer
in
the
pictur

the
given
blast
the
pirates
old
england

no
place
for
them
bill
you
get
the
colonel
down
we
send
buzzin
to
davy
jones
locker
if
they
ventur
ashore
here
the
lightning
had
come
to
anchor
without
colors
at
her
stern
as
she
had
no
mast
there
was
no
opportunity
to
fly
a
signal
at
her
head
or
the
union
jack
at
her
peak
after
the
manner
of
steam
yachts
she
had
a
pole
that
could
be
fitted
in
a
raking
position
aft
as
it
is
eight
bells
we
need
no
flags
explained
colonel
odminton
shall
we
fly
the
union
jack
then
asked
captain
hans
christian
the
colonel
changed
color
fly
he
snarled
by
fly
nothing
the
men
on
board
had
noticed
the
confusion
on
the
shore
they
thought
little
of
it
when
they
had
escaped
down
the
potomac
with
the
ransom
they
forgot
that
a
hundred
cameras
were
trained
upon
them
even
their
stupendous
speed
could
not
outstride
the
sensitive
plate
that
can
catch
a
perfect
likeness
in
one
part
of
a
second
the
duplex
shutter
is
craftier
than
the
criminal
the
camera
can
outwit
the
cannon
ball
it
did
not
occur
to
the
colonel
that
the
united
states
government
would
send
proclamations
to
every
friendly
nation
in
the
world
begging
each
to
distribute
them
broadcast
to
every
port
and
that
these
contained
a
reproduced
picture
of
colonel
odminton
venture
with
a
description
of
himself
calling
upon
the
nations
to
do
him
no
harm
but
to
grant
him
no
hospitality
whatever
while
the
colonel
was
dawdling
across
the
water
the
telegraph
and
the
swift
liners
had
alarmed
the
world
there
was
neither
admiration
nor
mercy
in
the
hearts
of
the
millions
who
were
watching
for
the
lightning
appearance
for
once
there
were
no
sentimental
women
waiting
to
cosset
the
bandit
he
had
held
the
president
wife
his
prisoner
at
last
the
soft
heart
of
womanhood
was
turned
to
stone
in
short
colonel
odminton
and
his
crew
were
declared
outcasts
from
the
world
and
even
the
most
abandoned
nations
sprang
to
the
appeal
of
the
united
states
and
stood
ready
to
enforce
the
decree
colonel
odminton
watched
his
launch
approaching
the
beach
he
had
not
allowed
his
son
to
go
and
the
two
stood
together
facing
the
enraged
town
already
the
coast
guards
were
drawn
up
awaiting
the
launch
when
it
had
come
within
fifty
yards
of
the
pier
the
man
in
command
cried
stop
her
in
a
loud
voice
captain
christian
obeyed
quickly
he
and
his
crew
were
near
enough
to
see
that
the
hand
of
every
inhabitant
had
grasped
a
stone
ready
to
hurl
hate
distorted
the
faces
of
the
honest
englishmen
who
traditionally
loathed
a
pirate
worse
than
a
papist
we
will
give
you
half
an
hour
to
leave
the
harbor
bawled
the
captain
at
the
launch
my
orders
are
to
fire
upon
every
one
of
you
who
attempts
to
land
there
is
no
landing
for
pirates
on
england
shores
get
out
d
ye
get
out
the
refrain
was
caught
up
from
throat
to
throat
and
hurled
at
the
frightened
sailors
the
shouts
reached
to
the
vessel
until
the
colonel
easily
understood
their
import
but
neither
he
nor
his
as
yet
knew
that
the
sight
of
this
beautiful
vessel
would
raise
a
similar
howl
of
hate
a
like
demonstration
of
hostility
in
every
port
from
china
westward
to
san
francisco
hastily
he
gave
orders
to
trip
the
anchor
in
ten
minutes
he
picked
up
his
men
who
were
cursing
civilization
with
the
pale
skin
cramped
upon
his
face
with
trembling
hands
and
blinded
eyes
he
guided
the
lightning
out
of
the
inhospitable
harbor
in
an
hour
the
world
knew
what
had
happened
at
penzance
the
smallest
harbor
on
the
english
and
french
coast
thrilled
with
the
excitement
of
the
novel
sport
while
colonel
odminton
sat
in
his
cabin
alone
bereft
of
his
complacency
and
beginning
to
be
touched
with
the
terrors
that
the
hunted
fox
feels
when
it
sights
the
first
hound
where
now
captain
christian
had
been
knocking
gently
and
now
opened
his
commander
door
for
orders
the
captain
was
a
cautious
man
and
was
the
only
one
on
board
who
by
reason
of
his
temperament
felt
the
serious
position
to
the
full
colonel
odminton
turned
his
head
moodily
and
scowled
at
his
captain
to
hell
with
you
he
ejaculated
yes
sir
said
captain
christian
respectfully
but
we
can
not
get
provisions
there
it
was
deepest
night
when
a
gurgling
thud
a
splash
of
returning
waters
a
rustling
of
chain
told
that
another
anchor
had
been
dropped
and
that
another
vessel
had
found
rest
in
the
harbor
of
brest
her
side
lights
were
quickly
extinguished
and
a
white
light
at
her
bow
as
she
swung
to
the
tide
told
curious
eyes
if
there
were
any
that
the
stranger
was
snug
for
the
night
four
bells
tinkled
here
and
tinkled
there
nor
did
the
omit
the
resonant
salutation
to
father
time
to
starboard
and
to
port
great
hulls
not
many
hundred
feet
away
could
be
distinguished
by
the
sharpest
eyes
rising
blacker
than
the
night
the
mediterranean
squadron
of
france
had
but
made
port
the
day
before
and
were
due
in
cherbourg
on
the
morrow
the
last
patient
launch
had
brought
the
last
gay
officer
aboard
and
peace
commanded
the
formidable
fleet
through
the
veiled
with
silk
a
light
glimmered
from
the
unconscious
vessel
that
had
just
dipped
anchor
colonel
odminton
at
that
moment
was
parting
the
curtains
from
his
son
bed
and
was
regarding
him
with
conflicting
expressions
the
lad
slept
restlessly
and
under
his
father
eyes
began
to
toss
and
mutter
fearing
to
waken
him
the
unhappy
man
withdrew
softly
to
his
own
cabin
there
he
poured
himself
out
a
full
glass
of
brandy
and
began
to
pace
the
floor
furiously
it
was
a
changed
face
that
looked
apprehensively
at
the
door
every
time
the
timbers
creaked
in
the
chop
of
the
sea
he
was
no
longer
the
elegant
complacent
and
successful
criminal
he
was
the
bandit
at
bay
he
was
distrustful
suspicious
ready
for
revenge
if
he
had
only
had
gatling
guns
aboard
he
would
have
taught
the
inhabitants
of
penzance
a
costly
lesson
for
their
threats
and
curses
now
for
the
first
time
he
rebelled
against
his
lineage
and
hated
englishmen
and
england
with
a
virulent
abhorrence
but
france
was
different
tolerant
blood
ran
in
her
veins
here
he
felt
secure
from
insult
the
nation
that
had
died
in
ecstasy
under
the
nod
of
napoleon
could
not
be
otherwise
than
liberal
to
him
colonel
odminton
did
not
exactly
expect
a
reception
by
the
president
of
the
republic
but
he
did
look
forward
to
a
respectful
and
harmless
curiosity
that
would
titillate
his
pride
and
remove
the
memory
of
his
indignities
his
face
began
to
assume
a
more
benevolent
expression
and
the
cowering
snarling
look
which
comes
to
those
who
find
themselves
detested
for
good
reasons
and
thrust
out
gave
way
to
one
of
hope
such
as
comes
to
the
convict
when
his
term
of
imprisonment
is
nearly
over
soothed
by
such
imaginations
the
colonel
smiled
with
disdain
snapped
his
finger
at
all
the
world
furtively
examined
his
secret
safe
and
went
to
bed
it
did
not
seem
to
him
that
he
had
been
slumbering
as
many
minutes
as
he
had
hours
when
he
was
startled
by
a
violent
tramping
upon
the
deck
above
him
by
the
clanking
revolutions
of
the
machinery
that
hoisted
the
anchor
and
then
before
he
had
mastered
his
laggard
senses
by
imperative
knocks
at
his
door
colonel
odminton
pulled
the
spring
and
his
captain
bounded
in
terror
was
engraved
on
every
line
of
that
usually
calm
and
observant
face
for
god
sake
he
cried
in
broken
english
and
danish
we
are
to
be
blown
up
in
ten
minutes
his
jaws
chattered
without
saying
any
more
he
was
stiff
with
fear
with
inconceivable
rapidity
colonel
odminton
thrust
himself
into
his
clothes
and
rushed
upon
deck
he
had
not
time
to
put
on
his
cap
and
as
he
emerged
in
the
rosy
light
of
the
breaking
sun
his
bare
head
was
seen
in
all
its
now
notorious
characteristics
a
cry
greeted
him
encompassed
about
by
the
huge
mastiffs
of
war
more
formidable
than
anything
the
vaunted
navy
of
the
united
states
could
boast
the
toy
terrier
shivered
at
the
earliest
dawn
the
upon
the
formidable
had
discerned
the
stranger
and
had
reported
the
vessel
to
his
superior
officer
the
french
republic
so
friendly
to
the
government
of
the
united
states
had
eagerly
distributed
placards
describing
the
nefarious
colonel
and
his
yacht
but
yesterday
copies
had
been
delivered
into
the
hands
of
the
officers
of
the
squadron
with
orders
to
keep
a
sharp
watch
for
the
outlaw
he
was
not
to
be
harmed
but
to
be
driven
away
from
france
if
necessary
at
the
torpedoes
breath
the
admiral
gave
quick
orders
which
were
enthusiastically
obeyed
a
fleet
of
launches
were
now
untethered
upon
the
lightning
no
masts
no
steam
propelled
by
electricity
it
is
she
such
exclamations
mixed
with
oaths
were
exchanged
by
the
frenchmen
as
they
surrounded
colonel
odminton
venture
ahoy
there
cried
an
officer
the
sleepy
scandinavian
in
the
colonel
pay
made
no
answer
he
scowled
at
france
vindictively
i
know
you
i
give
you
ten
minutes
to
depart
va
sacre
nom
de
dieu
if
you
ever
appear
on
ze
coast
of
france
again
pouf
sink
by
this
time
the
colonel
had
appeared
on
deck
the
french
natives
a
hundred
of
them
within
less
than
a
biscuit
throw
of
the
most
eminent
malefactor
of
the
age
gazed
at
him
curiously
and
then
burst
into
a
medley
of
curses
as
these
envenomed
oaths
struck
colonel
odminton
he
staggered
as
if
he
had
been
slapped
in
the
face
carbines
were
levelled
at
him
threateningly
but
the
french
officers
imperiously
gave
orders
for
all
weapons
to
be
laid
aside
by
this
time
captain
hans
had
the
anchor
raised
although
this
was
done
by
electricity
still
the
men
worked
furiously
these
embryonic
pirates
tottered
like
their
commander
with
an
overwhelming
fear
this
terrible
this
unexpected
this
deadly
persecution
how
far
did
it
extend
what
was
its
origin
was
it
a
chance
indignation
that
had
fomented
in
england
and
had
leaped
the
channel
or
was
it
a
decree
of
outlawry
that
was
passed
by
all
the
world
it
was
enough
to
scatter
the
colonel
pride
to
tear
out
of
him
his
complacency
the
proud
southerner
now
knew
like
the
prisoner
at
chillon
what
it
was
to
feel
the
hair
turn
white
an
arch
traitor
may
lose
his
own
country
and
get
a
footing
in
a
foreign
land
however
contemptible
his
position
may
be
but
colonel
odminton
and
his
crew
had
no
country
whatever
to
turn
to
civilization
had
with
one
accord
arisen
against
him
the
islands
of
the
sea
were
three
thousand
leagues
away
unsteadily
he
touched
the
lever
and
his
craft
forged
ahead
as
it
did
so
it
grazed
the
side
of
a
boat
with
a
final
curse
one
of
the
men
in
the
launch
stood
up
wadded
a
piece
of
paper
in
his
hands
and
flung
it
at
the
colonel
it
struck
the
malefactor
full
in
the
face
the
paper
itself
did
not
hurt
him
but
that
malicious
act
was
as
fatal
to
him
as
if
he
had
been
hit
in
the
groin
by
a
french
bullet
amid
derisive
shrieks
and
whistles
the
lightning
sped
out
of
the
harbor
the
men
upon
its
decks
shook
their
fists
at
france
and
cast
sinister
looks
at
their
employer
as
the
colonel
went
below
his
face
white
as
the
silver
poplar
his
hands
trembling
like
leaves
in
a
storm
he
mechanically
turned
at
the
companionway
and
picked
up
the
wad
of
paper
that
had
rolled
to
the
sill
it
was
a
copy
of
the
proclamation
warning
every
nation
not
to
grant
him
hospitality
in
the
name
of
the
american
republic
two
hours
later
the
colonel
and
his
captain
sat
opposite
each
other
talking
in
low
tones
the
proclamation
lay
open
on
the
table
between
them
it
is
impossible
then
to
provision
her
at
all
said
the
captain
slowly
there
is
no
hope
for
us
but
to
surrender
or
starve
disguise
is
impossible
the
colonel
nodded
wearily
we
have
food
for
twenty
men
for
three
days
we
have
power
left
to
go
three
thousand
knots
at
ten
knots
an
hour
the
men
are
murmuring
where
can
we
renew
our
power
the
yacht
is
useless
in
two
weeks
it
is
lucky
continued
captain
hans
after
a
pregnant
pause
that
none
of
the
men
picked
up
this
paper
you
would
have
been
knifed
before
night
if
it
is
possible
colonel
odminton
turned
a
shade
paler
but
he
did
not
say
anything
the
smallest
child
could
see
that
he
was
a
broken
man
what
a
trap
had
he
sprung
for
himself
the
case
is
desperate
sir
began
the
captain
again
what
do
you
propose
the
colonel
shook
his
head
vacantly
we
can
take
the
launch
the
men
and
the
gold
abandon
her
here
and
land
on
the
coast
we
might
escape
clear
the
colonel
shook
his
head
vigorously
he
was
ready
to
give
up
his
life
but
not
his
venture
then
we
will
go
sir
pay
us
give
us
the
launch
and
we
will
go
we
can
not
stay
to
be
starved
and
tossed
upon
the
sea
with
not
even
a
and
a
handkerchief
let
them
go
father
rupert
had
entered
from
his
own
room
and
stood
pleadingly
before
the
criminal
the
unhappy
man
looked
at
his
son
back
at
his
captain
and
nodded
assent
then
we
will
go
now
said
the
captain
decidedly
we
are
within
ten
miles
of
the
coast
the
launch
will
carry
us
easily
will
you
give
us
a
hundred
thousand
in
gold
you
may
keep
the
rest
you
and
the
boy
and
the
three
niggers
the
colonel
mechanically
went
to
an
inner
room
unlocked
a
secret
safe
took
out
a
heavy
weight
of
gold
and
threw
it
upon
the
table
before
the
captain
with
a
clang
the
stolen
money
was
newly
coined
and
the
gold
glistened
in
the
light
the
captain
tied
the
bag
and
held
out
his
hand
as
he
arose
he
was
honest
after
his
kind
though
a
masterful
man
but
the
proclamation
had
thrown
him
upon
his
still
he
felt
sorry
for
the
man
whom
the
proclamation
had
shrivelled
one
of
the
colonel
faithful
colored
sailors
was
sent
to
the
wheel
for
a
half
an
hour
there
was
a
bustle
of
chests
and
men
there
was
a
counting
of
gold
and
a
commanding
and
warning
voice
finally
there
was
a
splash
as
the
powerful
launch
dipped
into
the
water
from
its
davits
there
was
a
bounding
of
many
feet
and
a
cry
to
shove
her
off
colonel
one
man
shouted
but
the
rest
kept
a
silence
they
knew
that
many
dangers
were
before
them
then
the
launch
became
a
speck
against
a
gray
coast
where
now
father
asked
rupert
timidly
for
the
first
time
since
the
conception
of
his
infamous
deed
the
man
looked
his
son
straight
between
the
eyes
both
faces
were
furrowed
and
worn
and
prematurely
aged
the
eyes
of
both
were
sunken
and
rigid
home
my
son
home
said
the
colonel
gently
oh
father
cried
the
lad
kiss
me
my
son
if
you
care
to
and
now
leave
me
the
united
states
had
been
plunged
into
a
war
with
patagonia
the
how
of
it
was
a
disgrace
to
the
great
republic
jingoism
had
done
the
deed
and
the
mischief
of
the
matter
was
that
the
patagonian
cruisers
outnumbered
our
own
there
was
scurry
in
the
navy
yards
especially
within
that
upon
the
potomac
old
disabled
monitors
were
galvanized
into
the
delusion
of
life
guns
were
hurried
to
bombard
an
inhospitable
coast
thousands
of
miles
away
officials
at
their
desks
were
telegraphing
cipher
dispatches
to
england
to
furnish
vessels
of
war
on
hire
which
she
politely
refused
to
do
congress
was
passing
an
unrestricted
maritime
bill
during
this
hubbub
a
very
unusual
thing
happened
to
increase
the
confusion
of
the
navy
department
at
washington
about
nine
in
the
morning
while
several
ships
of
war
were
making
ready
for
sea
a
foreign
torpedo
boat
was
seen
to
up
the
river
passing
by
hidden
torpedoes
as
if
she
were
inspired
and
then
suddenly
with
a
swirl
coming
to
a
dead
halt
before
one
of
the
largest
of
the
formidable
vessels
in
alarm
the
crew
of
the
american
flagship
was
drummed
to
arms
and
the
gunners
were
called
to
their
ports
evidently
the
virulent
was
a
foe
bent
to
suicide
after
she
had
destroyed
the
fact
that
she
carried
no
flag
no
masts
nothing
but
a
bare
hull
made
her
alarming
in
the
extreme
it
was
an
apparition
of
death
the
american
fleet
trembled
at
what
invincible
vessel
would
the
bolt
be
launched
officers
paled
and
swore
at
this
terrible
display
of
audacity
a
paralysis
had
overtaken
them
only
a
boy
was
visible
on
the
stern
of
the
ominous
stranger
he
pulled
out
a
handkerchief
and
waved
it
he
seemed
to
touch
a
button
and
the
anchor
rattled
to
its
length
captain
and
gunners
breathed
relief
by
this
time
the
murmur
of
the
arrival
had
spread
and
thousands
of
quaking
men
lined
the
wharves
to
inspect
the
mystery
at
last
someone
thought
of
sending
a
boat
to
board
her
twenty
men
manned
a
launch
and
steamed
out
cautiously
ahoy
there
where
do
you
belong
demanded
the
officer
in
charge
of
the
launch
i
have
a
letter
to
the
president
of
the
united
states
answered
the
boy
with
quivering
lips
whose
vessel
is
this
let
down
the
gangway
two
black
sailors
sprang
from
the
hold
of
the
mysterious
vessel
to
obey
she
belongs
to
the
united
states
replied
the
boy
please
let
me
take
the
letter
you
can
take
the
boat
astounded
beyond
measure
the
officer
leaped
on
board
no
name
was
visible
what
is
her
name
he
asked
eagerly
she
has
none
the
president
can
name
her
she
was
called
the
said
the
boy
steadily
by
i
might
have
known
cried
the
officer
where
is
he
who
are
you
he
is
not
here
the
letter
tells
sir
i
am
his
son
rupert
put
both
hands
upon
the
spokes
of
the
wheel
and
held
his
head
up
straight
he
faced
the
officer
who
had
ordered
the
chase
when
the
lightning
escaped
with
his
country
gold
what
thoughts
went
through
the
lad
mind
did
he
regret
this
last
and
most
quixotic
step
did
he
long
to
up
the
anchor
and
give
the
signal
to
fly
ahead
did
he
regret
freedom
and
lawlessness
or
was
his
heart
that
was
broken
by
disgrace
healed
by
the
atonement
let
me
have
the
letter
the
officer
spoke
after
a
long
look
at
the
son
of
america
most
execrated
malefactor
his
voice
was
not
harsh
for
he
divined
how
the
boy
loyalty
to
his
father
and
his
country
really
blended
into
an
emotion
which
men
call
honor
rupert
put
his
hand
to
his
breast
my
orders
are
to
deliver
the
letter
to
the
president
with
my
own
hand
you
shall
do
so
the
president
is
there
the
officer
pointed
to
a
high
white
monster
of
distinction
he
is
aboard
there
he
is
watching
you
this
minute
jump
in
the
boy
paled
for
only
a
moment
his
courage
deserted
him
and
he
almost
tumbled
into
the
launch
a
great
crowd
of
witnesses
had
gathered
about
the
president
as
if
to
protect
him
the
word
assassin
was
whispered
from
man
to
man
even
the
officer
could
not
command
an
avenue
to
the
chief
executive
let
him
be
brought
said
the
president
authoritatively
with
a
marine
glass
he
had
watched
the
motions
of
the
vessel
the
boy
and
the
officer
i
know
him
give
way
there
let
him
come
alone
then
the
men
formed
a
living
circle
with
the
president
in
its
midst
and
rupert
stood
alone
with
him
in
it
with
head
bared
and
with
a
letter
in
his
shaking
hand
you
are
rupert
odminton
said
the
president
distinctly
after
a
long
searching
gaze
you
have
come
with
a
noble
purpose
what
is
it
without
answer
with
blood
beating
a
wild
tattoo
the
boy
bowed
his
head
in
acquiescence
he
handed
the
president
the
letter
this
the
president
took
and
opened
and
read
then
he
did
what
the
people
will
not
soon
forget
he
drew
the
son
of
his
captor
towards
him
put
his
left
hand
protectingly
upon
the
lad
head
and
with
a
ringing
voice
read
the
letter
aloud
president
and
people
of
the
united
states
i
thought
myself
a
god
and
know
myself
a
felon
i
who
meant
to
instruct
the
people
have
learned
a
lesson
such
as
even
death
can
not
teach
i
render
to
you
my
account
my
son
will
show
you
in
what
secret
safe
in
the
vessel
is
preserved

gold
that
i
stole
from
the
treasury

belongs
to
the
country
there

hundred
and
twenty
thousand
dollars
i
hereby
bequeath
the
boat
to
the
united
states
in
payment
for
the
balance

owe
it
cost
much
more
and
is
the
fastest
vessel
in
the
world
it
may
be
of
service
in
the
approaching
war
and
the
stain
upon
it
which
my
soul
tells
me
is
indelible

fade
i
give
my
son
to
you
as
hostage
of
my
good
faith
president
i

country
i

no

in
the
world
i
beg
you
if

you
to
offer
me
pardon
that
my
bones
may
rest
upon
the
soil

love
my
son

guide
such
a
messenger
of
forgiveness
to
me

be
sent
soon
if
at
all
for
my
crime

me
so
that
i
can
not
live
odminton
he
was
no
common
man
said
the
secretary
of
state
in
a
voice
of
great
feeling
president
i
suggest
that
the
pardon
be
sent
immediately
i
think
he
has
suffered
enough
the
president
smiled
benignly
secretary
he
said
turning
to
the
head
of
the
navy
shall
we
accept
the
yacht
i
think
the
treasury
will
find
room
for
the
gold
can
the
navy
find
room
for
colonel
odminton
atonement
the
eyes
of
the
secretary
of
the
navy
glistened
with
that
vessel
fixed
into
a
torpedo
boat
we
can
whip
the
world
i
shall
put
the
youngster
as
middy
aboard
of
her
he
understands
her
better
than
any
one
else
with
your
permission
president
the
boy
is
enrolled
and
his
commission
will
be
made
out
at
once
the
secretary
bowed
deferentially
do
you
wish
to
enter
the
united
states
navy
the
great
head
of
the
nation
bent
to
the
lad
as
he
would
have
to
his
own
son
oh
sir
but
my
father
cried
rupert
broken
by
pride
and
shame
and
filial
love
you
will
bear
the
pardon
said
the
president
kindly
i
would
rather
go
now
i
think
he
needs
it
whispered
rupert
timidly
then
the
boy
keyed
so
high
fell
and
was
borne
away
who
does
not
love
the
everglades
when
he
knows
them
the
adorer
of
the
warm
woods
had
rather
put
his
arm
about
a
palmetto
and
his
cheek
against
its
rough
surface
than
be
softly
met
by
the
tenderest
of
women
oh
the
witchery
of
the
everglades
father
father
a
longing
treble
cut
the
languorous
air
the
hidden
hut
behind
the
hidden
bay
was
empty
the
boy
and
the
officer
searched
hastily
and
fearfully
he
is
in
the
woods
oh
you
know
come
behind
the
son
the
officer
plunged
into
the
thicket
gloomy
shades
surrounded
him
warm
breaths
and
new
odors
caressed
him
almost
lifted
out
of
the
body
by
these
new
sensations
he
followed
with
speeding
feet
help
quick
the
shrill
voice
recalled
him
before
the
officer
knew
it
he
was
upon
a
figure
kneeling
beside
a
body
under
a
great
tree
father
he
has
forgiven
you
it
is
all
right
but
the
pleading
voice
of
the
lad
faltered
into
an
awful
silence
the
soldier
put
his
hand
upon
the
penitent
head
it
was
warm
the
dead
man
arms
were
outstretched
upon
the
great
tree
his
body
was
upon
the
huge
roots
his
lips
were
as
if
he
had
but
just
kissed
the
bark
did
his
sin
at
the
last
restrain
him
that
he
dared
not
to
touch
the
soil
of
america
and
fondle
it
as
his
own
he
had
died
unpardoned
it
was
to
be
that
he
should
be
tortured
to
the
end
but
as
to
when
he
died
they
could
not
tell
for
his
strong
limbs
were
set
the
swarming
southern
ants
had
not
desecrated
him
and
the
moaning
tree
seemed
to
be
explaining
that
she
had
kept
him
warm
upon
her
lap
he
was
buried
beneath
the
sod
to
which
with
the
of
the
true
southerner
he
had
crawled
back
to
die
they
laid
the
pardon
in
his
folded
hands
the
officer
walked
out
of
the
everglades
with
bared
head
he
could
not
understand
his
own
emotion
but
the
weeping
lad
followed
slowly
he
heard
a
cadence
above
the
grave
rupert
understood
it
it
was
the
dirge
of
the
live
oak
the
end
