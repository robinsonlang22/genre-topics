mryna
brill
intended
to
ride
the
above
the
rain
mist
for
a
long
time
she
had
not
believed
in
the
taboos
or
the
she
no
longer
believed
she
lived
on
earth
this
paradise
of
forests
and
running
brooks
was
something
called
rythar
six
years
ago
when
mryna
was
fourteen
she
first
discovered
the
truth
she
asked
a
question
and
the
ignored
it
a
simple
question
really
what
is
above
the
rain
mist
god
could
have
told
her
every
day
he
answered
technical
questions
that
were
far
more
difficult
instead
he
repeated
the
familiar
taboo
about
avoiding
the
old
village
because
of
the
sickness
and
consequently
mryna
being
female
went
to
the
old
village
there
was
nothing
really
unusual
about
that
all
the
kids
went
through
the
ruins
from
time
to
time
they
had
worked
out
a
sort
of
charm
that
made
it
all
right
they
ran
past
the
burned
out
shells
of
the
old
houses
and
they
kept
their
eyes
shaded
to
ward
off
the
sickness
but
even
at
fourteen
mryna
had
outgrown
charms
and
she
did
believe
in
the
sickness
she
had
once
asked
the
what
sickness
meant
and
the
screen
in
the
answer
house
had
given
her
a
very
detailed
answer
mryna
knew
that
none
of
the
hundred
girls
and
thirty
boys
inhabiting
rythar
had
ever
been
sick
that
like
the
taboo
of
the
old
village
she
considered
a
childish
superstition
the
old
village
was
large
three
parallel
roads
a
mile
long
lined
with
the
charred
ruins
of
prefabs
which
were
exactly
like
the
cottages
where
the
kids
lived
it
was
nothing
to
inspire
either
fear
or
legend
the
village
had
burned
a
long
time
ago
the
grass
from
the
forest
had
grown
a
green
mantle
over
the
skeletal
walls
for
weeks
mryna
poked
through
the
ruins
before
she
found
anything
of
significance
a
few
scorched
pages
of
a
printed
pamphlet
buried
deep
in
the
black
earth
the
paper
excited
her
tremendously
it
was
different
from
the
film
books
photographed
in
the
answer
house
she
had
never
touched
anything
like
it
and
it
seemed
wonderful
stuff
she
read
the
pamphlet
eagerly
it
was
part
of
a
promotional
advertisement
of
a
world
called
rythar
the
jewel
of
the
sirian
solar
system
the
description
made
it
obvious
that
rythar
was
the
green
paradise
where
mryna
lived
the
place
she
had
been
taught
to
call
earth
and
the
pamphlet
had
been
addressed
to
earthmen
everywhere
mryna
made
her
second
find
when
she
was
fifteen
a
textbook
in
astronomy
for
the
first
time
in
her
life
she
read
about
the
spinning
dust
of
the
universe
lying
beyond
the
eternal
rain
mist
that
hid
her
world
the
solid
stable
earth
of
her
childhood
was
solid
and
stable
no
longer
but
a
sphere
turning
through
a
black
void
nor
was
it
properly
called
earth
but
a
planet
named
rythar
the
adjustment
mryna
had
to
make
was
shattering
she
lost
faith
in
everything
she
believed
yet
the
logic
of
astronomy
appealed
to
her
orderly
mind
it
explained
why
the
rain
mist
glowed
with
light
during
the
day
and
turned
dark
at
night
mryna
had
never
seen
a
clear
sky
she
had
no
visual
data
to
tie
her
new
concept
to
for
six
years
she
kept
the
secret
she
hid
the
papers
and
the
astronomy
text
which
she
found
in
the
old
village
later
after
the
metal
men
came
she
destroyed
everything
so
none
of
the
other
women
would
know
the
was
a
man
at
first
she
kept
the
secret
because
she
was
afraid
for
some
reason
the
man
who
played
at
being
god
wanted
the
kids
to
believe
rythar
was
earth
the
totality
of
the
universe
enveloped
in
a
cloud
of
mist
she
knew
that
because
she
once
asked
god
what
a
planet
was
the
face
on
the
screen
in
the
answer
house
became
frigid
with
anger
or
was
it
fear
and
the
said
the
word
means
nothing
but
late
that
night
a
very
large
brought
six
metal
men
down
through
the
rain
mist
they
were
huge
jointed
things
that
clanked
when
they
walked
four
of
them
used
weapons
to
herd
the
kids
together
in
their
small
settlement
the
two
others
went
to
the
old
village
and
blasted
the
ruins
with
high
explosives
vaguely
mryna
remembered
that
the
metal
men
had
been
there
before
when
the
kids
were
still
very
small
they
had
built
the
new
settlement
and
they
had
brought
food
they
lived
with
the
children
for
a
long
time
she
thought
but
the
memory
was
hazy
as
the
years
passed
mryna
fear
retreated
and
only
one
thing
became
important
she
knew
the
was
a
man
on
the
fertile
soil
of
rythar
there
were
one
hundred
women
and
thirty
men
all
the
boys
had
taken
mates
before
they
reached
seventeen
seventy
girls
were
left
unmarried
with
no
prospect
of
ever
having
husbands
a
score
or
more
became
second
wives
in
polygamous
homes
but
plural
marriage
had
no
appeal
for
mryna
she
was
firmly
determined
to
possess
a
man
of
her
own
and
why
should
it
be
the
as
her
first
step
toward
escape
mryna
volunteered
for
duty
in
the
answer
house
for
as
long
as
she
could
remember
the
answer
house
had
stood
on
a
knoll
some
distance
beyond
the
new
settlement
it
was
a
square
building
housing
a
speaking
box
a
glass
screen
and
a
console
of
transmission
machinery
anyone
in
the
settlement
could
contact
god
and
request
information
or
special
equipment
god
went
out
of
his
way
to
deluge
them
with
information
the
simplest
question
produced
voluminous
data
transmitted
over
the
screen
and
photographed
on
reels
of
film
someone
had
to
be
in
the
answer
house
to
handle
the
photography
the
work
was
not
hard
but
it
was
monotonous
most
of
the
kids
preferred
to
farm
the
fields
or
dig
the
sacrificial
a
request
for
equipment
was
granted
just
as
promptly
tools
machines
seeds
fertilizers
packaged
buildings
games
clothing
everything
came
in
a
it
was
a
large
cylinder
which
hissed
down
from
the
rain
mist
on
a
pillar
of
fire
the
landing
site
was
a
flat
charred
field
near
the
answer
house
unless
the
equipment
was
unusually
heavy
the
attendant
stationed
in
the
house
was
expected
to
unload
the
and
pile
aboard
the
sacrifice
ores
mined
on
rythar
god
asked
two
things
from
the
settlement
the
pieces
of
unusually
heavy
metal
which
they
dug
from
the
hills
and
tiny
vials
of
soil
in
an
hour
time
they
could
mine
enough
ore
to
fill
the
compartment
of
a
and
god
never
complained
if
they
sometimes
sent
the
cylinder
back
empty
but
he
fussed
mightily
over
the
small
vials
of
earth
he
gave
very
explicit
directions
as
to
where
they
were
to
take
the
samples
and
the
place
was
never
the
same
sometimes
they
had
to
travel
miles
from
the
settlement
to
satisfy
that
inexplicable
whim
for
two
weeks
mryna
patiently
ran
off
the
endless
films
of
new
books
and
unloaded
the
when
it
came
she
examined
the
interior
of
the
cylinder
carefully
and
she
weighed
every
possible
risk
the
compartment
was
very
small
but
she
concluded
that
she
would
be
safe
and
so
she
made
her
decision
tense
and
mryna
brill
slipped
aboard
the
she
sealed
the
lock
door
which
automatically
fired
the
launching
tubes
after
that
there
was
no
turning
back
the
dark
compartment
shook
in
a
thunder
of
sound
the
weight
of
the
escape
speed
tore
at
her
body
pulling
her
tight
against
the
confining
walls
she
lost
consciousness
until
the
pressure
lessened
the
metal
walls
became
hot
but
the
space
was
too
confining
for
her
to
avoid
contact
entirely
four
narrow
light
tubes
came
on
with
a
dull
red
glow
and
suddenly
a
gelatinous
liquid
emptied
out
of
ceiling
vents
the
fluid
sprayed
every
exposed
surface
in
the
cubicle
draining
through
the
shipment
of
sacrifice
ores
at
mryna
feet
it
had
a
choking
antiseptic
odor
it
stung
mryna
face
and
inflamed
her
eyes
worse
still
as
the
liquid
soaked
into
her
clothing
it
disintegrated
the
fiber
tearing
away
the
cloth
in
long
strips
which
slowly
dissolved
in
the
liquid
on
the
floor
before
the
antiseptic
spray
ceased
mryna
was
helplessly
naked
even
her
black
boots
had
not
survived
the
red
lights
went
out
and
mryna
was
imprisoned
again
in
the
crushing
darkness
a
terror
of
the
taboos
she
had
defied
swept
her
mind
she
began
to
scream
but
the
sound
was
lost
in
the
roar
of
the
motors
suddenly
it
was
over
the
lurched
into
something
hard
mryna
was
thrown
against
the
ceiling
and
she
hung
there
weightless
the
pieces
of
sacrifice
ore
were
floating
in
the
darkness
just
as
she
was
the
motors
cut
out
and
the
lock
door
swung
open
mryna
saw
a
circular
room
brightly
lighted
with
a
glaring
blue
light
the
nature
of
her
fear
changed
this
was
the
house
of
the
but
she
could
not
let
him
find
her
naked
she
tried
to
run
into
the
circular
room
she
found
that
the
slightest
exertion
of
her
muscles
sent
her
spinning
through
the
air
she
could
not
get
her
feet
on
the
floor
there
was
no
down
and
no
up
in
that
room
she
collided
painfully
with
the
metal
wall
and
she
snatched
at
a
light
bracket
to
keep
herself
from
bouncing
free
in
the
empty
air
again
the
had
landed
against
what
was
either
the
ceiling
or
the
floor
of
the
circular
room
mryna
had
no
way
of
making
a
differentiation
eight
brightly
lighted
corridors
opened
into
the
side
walls
mryna
heard
footsteps
moving
toward
her
down
one
of
the
corridors
she
pulled
herself
blindly
into
another
as
she
went
farther
from
the
circular
room
a
vague
sense
of
gravity
returned
at
the
end
of
the
corridor
she
was
able
to
stand
on
her
feet
again
although
she
still
had
to
walk
very
carefully
any
sudden
movement
sent
her
soaring
in
a
graceful
leap
that
banged
her
head
against
the
ceiling
cautiously
she
opened
a
thick
metal
door
into
another
hall
and
she
stood
transfixed
looking
through
a
mica
wall
at
the
emptiness
of
space
pinpointed
with
its
billions
of
stars
this
was
the
reality
of
the
charts
she
had
seen
in
the
astronomy
text
that
knowledge
alone
saved
her
sanity
she
had
believed
it
when
the
proof
lay
hidden
above
the
rain
mist
she
must
believe
it
now
from
where
she
stood
she
was
able
to
see
the
place
where
the
had
brought
her
like
a
vast
cartwheel
spinning
in
the
void
the
was
clamped
against
the
hub
from
which
eight
corridors
radiated
outward
like
wheel
spokes
toward
the
rim
far
below
the
gigantic
wheel
mryna
saw
the
sphere
of
rythar
invisible
behind
its
shroud
of
glowing
mist
she
moved
along
the
rim
corridor
past
the
mica
wall
until
she
came
to
a
door
that
stood
open
the
room
beyond
was
a
sleeping
compartment
and
it
was
empty
she
searched
it
for
clothing
and
found
nothing
she
went
through
four
more
dormitory
rooms
before
she
came
upon
anything
she
could
use
brief
shorts
clearly
made
for
a
man
and
a
loose
white
tunic
it
was
suitable
it
was
the
way
she
wanted
to
be
dressed
when
she
faced
him
but
it
had
to
do
mryna
was
pawing
through
a
footlocker
looking
for
boots
when
she
heard
a
hesitant
step
behind
her
she
whirled
and
saw
a
small
stooped
man
naked
except
for
trunks
like
the
ones
she
was
wearing
the
wrinkled
skin
on
his
wasted
chest
was
burned
brown
by
the
hot
glare
of
the
sun
glasses
hung
from
a
chain
around
his
neck
my
dear
young
lady
he
said
in
a
tired
voice
this
is
a
men
ward
i
sorry
i
did
know
you
must
be
a
new
patient
he
fumbled
for
his
glasses
instinctively
she
knew
she
should
let
him
see
her
clearly
enough
to
identify
her
as
a
stranger
she
shoved
past
him
knocking
the
glasses
from
his
hand
i
better
find
my
own
ward
mryna
did
know
the
word
but
she
supposed
it
meant
some
sort
of
sleeping
chamber
the
old
man
said
chattily
i
had
heard
they
were
bringing
in
any
new
patients
today
she
was
in
the
corridor
by
that
time
he
reached
for
her
hand
i
see
you
in
the
sunroom
it
was
a
timid
hopeful
question
and
you
tell
me
all
the
news
everything
they
doing
back
on
earth
i
have
been
home
for
almost
a
year
she
fled
down
the
hall
when
she
heard
voices
ahead
of
her
she
pulled
back
a
door
and
slid
into
another
room
a
storeroom
piled
with
cases
of
medicines
behind
the
cartons
she
thought
she
would
be
safe
this
was
what
she
had
expected
mryna
thought
there
might
be
one
man
living
in
a
kind
of
prefab
somehow
suspended
above
the
rain
mist
but
there
were
obviously
others
up
here
she
did
know
how
many
and
the
old
man
frightened
her
more
than
the
dazzling
sight
of
the
heavens
visible
through
the
mica
wall
mryna
had
never
seen
physical
age
before
no
one
on
rythar
was
older
than
she
was
herself
a
sturdy
healthy
lusty
twenty
the
old
man
infirmity
disgusted
her
for
the
first
time
in
her
life
she
was
conscious
of
the
slow
decay
of
death
the
door
of
the
supply
room
slid
open
mryna
crouched
low
behind
the
cartons
but
she
was
able
to
see
the
man
and
the
woman
who
had
entered
the
room
a
woman
here
mryna
had
considered
that
possibility
perhaps
the
already
had
a
mate
the
newcomers
were
dressed
in
crisp
white
uniforms
the
woman
wore
a
starched
white
hat
they
carried
a
tray
of
small
glass
cylinders
from
which
metal
needles
projected
while
the
woman
held
the
tray
the
man
drove
the
needles
through
the
caps
of
small
bottles
and
filled
the
cylinders
with
a
liquid
when
are
you
leaving
dick
the
woman
asked
in
about
forty
minutes
they
sending
an
oh
no
now
do
start
worrying
they
have
got
the
bugs
out
of
it
by
this
time
the
are
entirely
trustworthy
sure
that
what
the
army
says
in
theory
they
should
be
even
more
reliable
than
i
wish
you
wait
for
the
hospital
shuttle
and
miss
the
chance
to
address
congress
this
year
we
worked
too
long
for
this
i
do
want
to
muff
it
now
we
all
the
statistical
proof
we
need
even
to
convince
those
pinchpenny
halfwits
during
the
past
eight
years
we
handled
more
than
a
thousand
cases
up
here
on
earth
they
were
pronounced
incurable
we
sent
better
than
eighty
per
cent
back
in
good
health
after
an
average
stay
of
fourteen
months
no
medical
man
has
ever
questioned
the
efficiency
of
cosmic
radiation
and
a
reduced
atmospheric
gravity
dick
it
just
our
statesmen
always
yapping
about
the
budget
but
this
time
we
have
the
cost
problem
licked
too
for
a
year
and
a
half
the
ore
they
send
up
from
rythar
has
paid
for
our
entire
operation
i
did
know
that
we
kept
it
under
wraps
so
the
politicians
would
cut
our
appropriations
their
glass
tubes
were
full
and
they
turned
toward
the
door
it
right
the
woman
persisted
for
them
not
to
send
a
piloted
shuttle
after
you
dick
it
is
dignified
you
our
assistant
medical
director
and
her
words
were
cut
off
as
the
door
slid
shut
behind
them
mryna
tried
to
fit
this
new
information
into
what
she
already
knew
or
thought
she
knew
about
the
it
did
add
up
to
a
pretty
picture
she
had
once
asked
for
a
definition
of
illness
and
it
was
apparent
to
her
that
this
place
which
they
called
the
guardian
wheel
was
an
expensive
hospital
for
earthmen
it
was
paid
for
by
the
sacrificial
ores
mined
on
rythar
in
a
sense
rythar
was
being
enslaved
and
exploited
by
earth
true
it
was
not
difficult
to
dig
out
the
ore
but
mryna
resented
the
fact
that
the
kids
on
rythar
had
not
been
told
the
truth
she
had
long
ago
lost
her
awe
of
the
man
called
god
now
she
lost
her
respect
as
well
mryna
was
glad
she
had
not
seen
him
glad
no
one
knew
she
was
aboard
the
guardian
wheel
she
would
return
to
rythar
after
she
told
the
others
what
she
knew
rythar
would
send
up
no
more
sacrifice
ores
let
the
earthmen
come
down
and
mine
it
for
themselves
very
cautiously
she
pulled
the
door
open
the
rim
corridor
was
empty
she
moved
toward
one
of
the
intersecting
corridors
when
she
heard
footsteps
she
hid
in
another
dormitory
room
this
was
different
from
the
others
it
showed
more
evidence
of
permanent
occupation
she
guessed
it
was
a
dormitory
for
the
people
who
took
care
of
the
sick
pictures
were
fastened
to
the
curved
metal
walls
personal
articles
cluttered
the
shelves
hung
beside
the
bunks
on
a
writing
desk
she
saw
a
number
of
typed
reports
five
freshly
laundered
uniforms
identical
to
the
one
she
had
lost
in
the
antiseptic
wash
hung
on
a
rack
behind
the
door
mryna
stripped
off
the
makeshift
she
was
wearing
and
put
on
one
of
the
uniforms
she
found
boots
under
the
desk
when
she
was
dressed
she
stood
admiring
herself
in
the
polished
surface
of
the
metal
door
she
was
a
handsome
woman
and
she
was
very
conscious
of
that
her
face
was
tanned
by
the
sunlight
of
rythar
her
lips
were
red
and
sensuous
her
long
hair
fell
to
her
shoulders
she
compared
herself
to
the
small
female
she
had
seen
in
the
supply
room
was
that
a
typical
earthwoman
mryna
lips
curled
in
a
scornful
smile
let
the
gods
come
down
to
rythar
then
and
discover
what
a
real
female
was
like
in
the
lush
green
rytharian
paradise
mryna
went
to
the
desk
and
glanced
at
the
typed
reports
they
had
been
written
by
a
man
who
signed
himself
commander
in
charge
guardian
wheel
and
they
were
addressed
to
the
congress
of
the
world
government
one
typed
document
was
a
supply
inventory
a
second
still
unfinished
was
a
budget
report
wo
show
a
profit
next
mryna
thought
vindictively
we
stop
sending
you
the
sacrifice
another
report
dealt
with
rythar
and
mryna
read
it
with
more
interest
one
paragraph
caught
her
attention
we
have
asked
for
soil
samples
to
be
taken
from
an
area
covering
ten
thousand
square
miles
our
chemical
analysis
has
been
thorough
and
we
find
nothing
that
could
be
remotely
harmful
to
human
life
atmospheric
samples
produce
the
same
negative
results
on
the
other
hand
we
have
direct
evidence
that
no
animal
life
has
ever
evolved
on
rythar
the
life
cycle
is
exclusively
botanical
the
soil
samples
mryna
realized
would
be
the
vials
of
earth
which
the
had
requested
so
often
were
the
earthmen
planning
to
move
their
hospital
down
to
rythar
that
idea
disturbed
her
mryna
did
not
want
her
garden
world
cluttered
up
with
a
lot
of
sick
old
men
discarded
by
earth
she
turned
to
the
second
page
of
the
report
the
original
colony
survived
for
a
year
the
sickness
in
the
old
village
developed
only
after
the
first
harvest
of
food
it
is
more
and
more
evident
that
the
botanical
cycle
of
rythar
must
be
examined
before
we
find
the
answer
to
do
that
adequately
we
shall
have
to
send
survey
teams
to
the
surface
that
requires
much
larger
appropriations
for
research
than
we
have
had
in
the
past
the
metal
immunization
suits
which
must
of
course
be
destroyed
after
each
expedition
and
what
may
i
ask
is
the
meaning
of
this
mryna
dropped
the
report
and
swung
toward
the
door
she
saw
a
woman
standing
there
another
earthwoman
with
a
starched
white
cap
perched
on
her
graying
hair
i
must
have
come
to
the
wrong
room
mryna
said
in
a
small
voice
indeed
everyone
knows
this
is
command
headquarters
who
are
you
the
woman
put
her
hand
on
mryna
arm
and
the
fingers
bit
through
the
uniform
into
mryna
flesh
mryna
pulled
away
drawing
her
shoulders
back
proudly
why
should
she
feel
afraid
she
stood
a
head
taller
than
this
dried
up
stranger
she
knew
the
earthwoman
strength
would
be
no
match
for
hers
my
name
is
mryna
brill
she
said
quietly
i
came
up
in
a
from
rythar
rythar
the
woman
mouth
fell
open
she
whispered
the
word
as
if
it
were
profanity
suddenly
she
turned
and
ran
down
the
rim
corridor
screaming
in
terror
afraid
of
mryna
thought
and
that
made
no
sense
at
all
mryna
knew
she
had
to
get
back
to
the
quickly
since
the
earthmen
had
built
up
the
taboos
in
order
to
get
their
sacrifice
ores
from
rythar
they
would
do
everything
they
could
to
prevent
her
return
she
ran
toward
an
intersecting
spoke
corridor
an
alarm
bell
began
to
clang
and
the
sound
vibrated
against
the
metal
walls
an
armed
man
sprang
from
a
side
room
and
fired
his
weapon
at
mryna
the
discharge
burned
a
deep
groove
in
the
wall
so
they
would
even
kill
her
these
men
who
pretended
to
be
gods
before
the
man
could
fire
again
mryna
swung
down
a
side
corridor
and
at
once
the
sensation
of
weightlessness
overtook
her
she
could
not
move
quickly
she
saw
the
armed
man
at
the
mouth
of
the
corridor
frantically
she
pushed
open
the
door
of
a
room
which
was
crowded
with
consoles
of
transmission
machines
three
men
were
seated
in
front
of
the
speakers
they
jumped
and
came
toward
her
clumsily
fighting
the
weightlessness
mryna
caught
at
the
door
jamb
and
swung
herself
toward
the
ceiling
at
the
same
time
the
armed
man
fired
the
discharge
missed
her
and
washed
against
the
transmission
machinery
blue
fire
exploded
from
the
room
the
three
men
screamed
in
agony
concussion
threw
mryna
helplessly
toward
the
rim
again
and
the
guardian
wheel
was
plunged
into
darkness
mryna
head
swam
her
shoulder
seethed
with
pain
where
she
had
banged
into
the
wall
she
tried
to
creep
toward
the
circular
room
but
she
had
lost
her
sense
of
direction
and
she
found
herself
back
on
the
rim
the
clanging
bell
had
stopped
when
the
lights
went
out
but
mryna
heard
the
panic
of
frightened
voices
far
away
someone
was
screaming
running
feet
clattered
toward
her
mryna
flattened
herself
against
the
outer
wall
an
indistinct
body
of
men
shot
past
her
from
rythar
one
of
them
was
saying
a
woman
from
rythar
and
we
blasted
the
communication
center
we
no
way
of
sending
the
warning
back
to
earth
they
were
gone
mryna
moved
back
into
the
spoke
corridor
she
felt
her
way
silently
toward
the
circular
hub
room
and
the
suddenly
very
close
she
heard
voices
which
she
recognized
the
man
and
the
woman
who
had
been
talking
in
the
supply
room
you
still
all
right
dick
the
woman
said
she
has
been
here
long
enough
to
we
do
know
that
we
do
know
how
it
spreads
or
how
quickly
we
ca
take
the
chance
then
then
we
no
choice
her
voice
was
a
small
whisper
choked
with
terror
none
these
have
been
standing
emergency
orders
for
twenty
years
we
always
faced
the
possibility
that
one
of
them
would
escape
if
we
been
allowed
to
use
a
different
policy
of
education
but
the
politicians
would
permit
that
the
wheel
has
to
be
destroyed
and
we
must
die
with
it
could
we
wait
and
make
sure
it
works
too
fast
none
of
us
would
be
able
to
do
the
job
afterward
the
voices
moved
away
mryna
floated
toward
the
hub
room
she
found
the
air
lock
and
pulled
herself
into
the
the
metal
lock
hissed
closed
and
light
came
on
then
she
knew
she
had
made
a
mistake
this
ship
was
not
the
one
she
had
used
when
she
came
up
from
rythar
the
tiny
cabin
was
fitted
with
a
sleeping
lounge
a
food
cabinet
and
a
file
of
reading
films
above
the
lounge
a
mica
viewplate
gave
her
a
broad
view
of
the
sky
mryna
remembered
that
the
man
in
the
supply
room
had
said
he
was
waiting
for
an
he
was
on
his
way
back
to
earth
mryna
had
taken
his
ship
instead
of
her
own
in
panic
she
tried
to
open
the
door
again
but
she
found
no
way
to
do
it
machinery
beneath
her
feet
began
to
hum
she
felt
a
slight
lurch
as
the
pickup
left
the
hub
of
the
guardian
wheel
it
swung
in
a
wide
arc
through
the
viewplate
she
saw
the
enormous
wheel
growing
small
behind
her
silhouetted
against
the
mist
of
rythar
suddenly
the
wheel
glowed
red
with
a
soundless
explosion
its
flaming
fragments
died
in
the
void
mryna
dropped
weakly
on
the
lounge
nausea
spun
through
her
mind
the
man
had
said
they
would
destroy
themselves
because
mryna
had
come
aboard
but
why
were
they
afraid
of
her
what
possible
harm
could
she
do
them
mryna
had
left
rythar
to
discover
the
truth
and
the
truth
was
insanity
was
truth
always
like
this
a
bitter
disillusionment
an
empty
horror
she
had
something
else
to
say
to
the
people
of
rythar
now
not
that
the
gods
were
men
but
that
men
were
mad
believe
in
the
taboos
send
up
the
sacrificial
ores
it
was
a
small
price
to
pay
to
keep
that
madness
away
from
rythar
and
mryna
knew
she
could
not
go
back
with
the
wheel
gone
she
could
never
return
to
rythar
the
was
carrying
her
inexorably
toward
earth
the
scream
of
the
machinery
slowly
turned
shrill
hammering
against
her
eardrums
the
stars
visible
in
the
viewplate
blurred
and
winked
out
mryna
felt
a
twist
of
vertigo
as
the
shuttle
shifted
from
conventional
speed
into
a
time
warp
and
then
the
sound
was
gone
the
ship
was
floating
in
an
impenetrable
blackness
mryna
had
no
idea
how
much
time
passed
subjectively
when
she
became
hungry
she
took
food
from
the
cabinet
she
slept
when
she
was
tired
to
pass
the
time
she
turned
the
reading
films
through
the
projector
most
of
the
film
stored
in
the
shuttle
covered
material
mryna
already
knew
the
earthmen
clearly
had
not
denied
any
information
to
rythar
only
one
thing
had
been
restricted
astronomy
and
that
would
have
made
no
difference
if
mryna
had
not
found
the
text
in
the
ruins
of
the
old
village
the
people
on
rythar
never
saw
the
stars
they
had
no
way
of
knowing
or
caring
what
lay
above
the
rain
mist
mryna
was
more
interested
in
the
history
of
earth
which
she
had
never
known
before
she
studied
the
pictures
of
the
great
industrial
centers
and
the
crowded
countryside
she
was
awed
by
the
mobs
in
the
city
streets
and
the
towering
buildings
yet
she
liked
her
own
world
more
the
forests
and
the
brooks
the
vast
uncrowded
open
spaces
it
puzzled
her
that
the
people
of
earth
would
give
the
rytharian
paradise
to
a
handful
of
children
when
their
own
world
was
so
overcrowded
was
this
another
form
of
the
madness
that
had
driven
the
people
in
the
wheel
to
destroy
themselves
that
made
a
convenient
explanation
yet
mryna
mind
was
too
logical
to
accept
it
one
film
referred
to
the
founding
of
the
original
colony
on
rythar
a
planet
in
the
sirian
system
which
had
been
named
for
its
discoverer
rythar
according
to
the
film
was
one
of
a
score
of
colonies
established
by
earth
it
was
unbelievably
rich
in
deposits
of
uranium
that
mryna
surmised
was
the
name
of
the
sacrificial
ore
they
sent
up
in
the
the
atmosphere
and
gravity
of
rythar
duplicated
that
of
earth
rythar
should
have
become
the
largest
colony
in
the
system
the
government
of
earth
had
originally
planned
a
migration
of
ten
million
persons
but
after
twelve
months
the
survey
colony
was
destroyed
by
an
infection
mryna
read
on
the
projection
screen
which
has
never
been
identified
it
is
called
simply
the
sickness
the
origin
of
this
plague
is
unknown
no
adult
in
the
survey
colony
survived
children
born
on
rythar
are
themselves
immune
but
are
carriers
of
the
sickness
the
first
rescue
team
sent
to
save
them
died
within
eight
hours
no
human
being
aside
from
these
children
has
ever
survived
the
sickness
now
mryna
had
the
whole
truth
she
knew
the
motivation
for
their
madness
of
it
was
not
insanity
but
the
sublime
courage
of
a
few
human
beings
sacrificing
themselves
to
save
the
rest
of
their
civilization
they
smashed
the
guardian
wheel
to
keep
the
sickness
there
and
mryna
had
already
escaped
before
that
happened
she
was
being
hurled
through
space
toward
earth
and
she
would
destroy
that
too
if
she
killed
herself
that
would
in
no
way
alter
the
situation
the
ship
would
still
move
in
its
appointed
course
her
body
would
be
aboard
perhaps
the
very
furnishings
in
the
cabin
were
now
infected
with
the
germ
of
the
sickness
when
the
ship
touched
earth
the
fatal
poison
would
escape
dully
mryna
turned
up
another
frame
on
the
film
and
she
read
what
the
earthmen
had
done
to
help
rythar
they
built
the
guardian
wheel
to
isolate
the
sickness
sealed
in
metal
immunization
suits
volunteers
had
descended
to
the
plague
world
and
reared
the
surviving
children
of
the
colonists
until
they
were
old
enough
to
look
out
for
themselves
the
answer
house
had
been
set
up
as
an
instructional
device
as
nearly
as
possible
the
scientists
in
charge
attempted
to
create
a
normal
social
situation
for
the
plague
carriers
they
could
never
be
allowed
to
leave
rythar
but
when
they
matured
enough
to
know
the
truth
rythar
could
be
integrated
into
the
colonial
system
rytharian
uranium
is
already
a
significant
trade
factor
in
the
colonial
market
an
incidental
of
the
guardian
wheel
is
the
hospital
facility
where
advanced
cases
of
certain
cancers
and
lung
diseases
have
been
cured
in
a
reduced
gravity
or
by
exposure
to
cosmic
radiation
mryna
shut
off
the
projection
the
words
made
sense
but
the
results
did
not
and
she
knew
precisely
why
earth
had
failed
when
they
matured
in
those
three
words
she
had
her
answer
and
now
it
did
matter
there
was
nothing
she
could
do
her
ship
was
a
poisoned
arrow
aimed
directly
at
the
heart
of
man
civilization
mryna
had
slept
twice
when
the
lurched
out
of
the
time
drive
and
she
was
able
to
see
the
stars
again
directly
ahead
of
her
she
saw
an
emerald
planet
bright
in
the
sun
and
she
knew
instinctively
that
it
was
earth
a
speaker
under
the
viewport
throbbed
with
the
sound
of
a
human
voice
sc
attention
you
are
assigned
landing
slot
port
chicago
i
repeat
dial
that
destination
do
you
read
me
three
times
the
message
was
repeated
before
mryna
concluded
that
it
was
meant
for
her
she
found
three
small
knobs
close
to
the
speaker
and
a
plastic
toggle
labeled
voice
reply
she
snapped
it
shut
and
found
that
she
could
speak
to
the
chicago
spaceport
her
problem
was
easily
solved
then
she
could
say
she
came
from
rythar
without
hesitation
earth
ships
would
be
sent
to
blast
her
ship
out
of
the
sky
before
she
would
be
able
to
land
but
she
knew
she
had
to
accomplish
more
than
that
the
same
mistake
must
not
be
repeated
again
how
much
time
do
i
have
she
asked
minutes
can
you
keep
this
shuttle
up
here
any
longer
than
that
lady
the
are
on
come
hell
or
high
water
they
land
exactly
on
schedule
what
happens
if
i
do
dial
the
slot
destination
we
bring
you
in
on
emergency
and
you
fork
over
a
thousand
buck
fine
mryna
asked
to
be
allowed
to
speak
to
someone
in
authority
in
the
government
the
chicago
port
manager
told
her
the
request
was
absurd
for
nine
minutes
mryna
argued
with
a
mounting
sense
of
urgency
before
he
gave
his
grudging
consent
her
trouble
was
that
she
had
to
skate
close
to
the
truth
without
admitting
it
directly
she
could
not
except
as
a
last
resort
let
them
kill
her
until
they
knew
why
the
isolation
of
rythar
had
failed
it
was
thirteen
minutes
before
landing
when
mryna
finally
heard
an
older
more
dignified
voice
on
the
speaker
by
then
the
green
globe
of
earth
filled
the
sky
mryna
could
make
out
the
shapes
of
the
continents
turning
below
her
the
older
man
identified
himself
as
a
senator
elected
to
the
planetary
congress
she
did
know
how
much
authority
he
represented
but
she
could
afford
to
wait
any
longer
she
told
him
frankly
who
she
was
she
knew
she
was
pronouncing
her
own
death
sentence
yet
she
spoke
quietly
she
must
show
the
same
courage
that
the
earthmen
had
when
they
sacrificed
themselves
in
the
guardian
wheel
listen
to
me
for
two
minutes
more
before
you
blast
my
ship
she
asked
i
rode
the
up
from
rythar
i
am
coming
now
to
spread
the
sickness
on
earth
because
i
wanted
to
know
the
truth
about
something
that
puzzled
me
i
had
to
know
what
was
above
the
rain
mist
in
the
answer
house
you
would
not
tell
us
that
now
i
understand
why
we
were
children
you
were
waiting
for
us
to
mature
and
that
is
the
mistake
you
made
that
blindness
nearly
destroyed
your
civilization
you
will
have
to
build
another
guardian
wheel
this
time
do
hide
anything
from
us
because
we
children
the
truth
makes
us
mature
not
illusions
or
taboos
never
forget
that
it
is
easier
to
face
a
fact
than
to
have
to
give
up
a
dream
we
been
taught
to
believe
tell
your
children
the
truth
when
they
ask
for
it
tell
us
please
we
can
adjust
to
it
we
just
as
human
as
you
are
mryna
drew
a
long
breath
her
lips
were
trembling
did
this
man
understand
what
she
had
tried
to
say
she
would
never
know
if
she
failed
earth
in
spite
of
its
generosity
and
its
courage
would
one
day
be
destroyed
by
children
bred
on
too
many
delusions
i
ready
mryna
said
steadily
send
up
your
warships
and
destroy
me
she
waited
less
than
ten
minutes
were
left
her
shuttle
began
to
move
more
slowly
she
was
no
more
than
a
mile
above
earth
she
saw
the
soaring
cities
and
the
white
highways
twisting
through
green
fields
seven
minutes
left
where
were
the
warships
she
looked
anxiously
through
the
viewport
and
the
sky
was
empty
desperately
she
closed
the
voice
toggle
again
send
them
quickly
she
cried
you
must
not
let
me
land
no
reply
came
from
the
speaker
her
began
to
circle
a
large
city
which
lay
at
the
southern
tip
of
an
inland
lake
three
minutes
more
the
ship
nosed
toward
the
spaceport
why
do
you
do
something
mryna
screamed
what
are
you
waiting
for
the
shuttle
settled
into
a
metal
rack
the
lock
hissed
open
mryna
shrank
back
against
the
wall
looking
out
at
what
she
would
destroy
what
she
had
already
destroyed
a
dignified
portly
man
came
panting
up
the
ramp
toward
her
no
she
whispered
do
come
in
here
i
am
senator
brieson
he
said
shortly
for
ten
years
jameson
has
been
telling
us
from
the
guardian
wheel
that
we
should
adopt
a
different
educational
policy
toward
rythar
your
scare
broadcast
was
clever
but
we
used
to
jameson
tricks
he
be
removed
from
office
for
this
and
if
i
have
anything
to
say
about
it
you
did
believe
me
mryna
gasped
of
course
not
if
a
plague
carrier
escaped
from
rythar
we
would
have
heard
about
it
long
before
this
the
trouble
with
you
scientists
is
you
do
grant
the
rest
of
us
any
common
sense
and
jameson
the
worst
of
the
lot
he
always
contended
that
the
sociologists
should
determine
our
rytharian
policy
not
the
elected
representatives
of
the
people
mryna
broke
down
and
began
to
cry
hysterically
the
senator
put
his
hand
under
her
arm
none
too
gently
let
have
no
more
dramatics
please
you
do
know
how
fortunate
you
are
young
lady
if
the
politicians
were
as
as
you
scientists
claim
we
are
we
might
have
believed
that
nonsense
and
blasted
your
ship
out
of
the
sky
you
scientists
have
to
give
up
the
notion
that
you
our
guardians
quite
able
to
look
out
for
ourselves
