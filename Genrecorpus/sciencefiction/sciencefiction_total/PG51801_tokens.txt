extensive

any

that

staghorn
dared
tug
at
the
veil
that
hid
the
future
maybe
it
was
a
crime
to
look
maybe
it
was
just
that
the
future
was
ugly
i
clarence
peccary
was
an
objective
man
his
increasing
irritation
was
caused
he
realized
by
the
fear
that
his
conscience
was
going
to
intervene
between
him
and
the
vast
fortune
that
was
definitely
within
his
grasp
millions
billions
but
he
wanted
to
enjoy
it
he
did
want
to
skulk
through
life
avoiding
the
eyes
of
everyone
he
met
particularly
when
his
life
might
last
for
centuries
so
he
sat
glowering
at
the
rectangular
screen
that
was
located
just
above
the
control
console
of
roger
staghorn
great
digital
computer
at
the
moment
peccary
was
ready
to
accuse
staghorn
of
having
no
conscience
whatsoever
it
was
only
through
an
act
of
scientific
detachment
that
he
reminded
himself
that
staghorn
neither
had
a
fortune
to
gain
nor
cared
about
gaining
one
staghorn
fulfillment
was
in
humanac
the
name
he
given
the
electronic
monster
that
presently
claimed
his
full
attention
he
sat
at
the
controls
his
eyes
luminous
behind
the
magnification
of
his
thick
lenses
his
lanky
frame
arched
forward
for
a
better
view
of
humanac
screen
far
from
showing
annoyance
at
what
he
saw
there
was
a
positive
leer
on
his
face
as
well
there
might
be
on
the
screen
was
the
full
color
picture
of
a
small
park
in
what
appeared
to
be
the
center
of
a
town
it
was
a
shabby
little
park
rags
and
tattered
papers
waggled
indolently
in
the
breeze
the
grass
was
an
unkempt
indifferent
pattern
of
greens
and
browns
as
though
the
caretaker
took
small
pains
in
setting
his
sprinklers
beyond
the
square
was
a
church
its
steeple
listing
dangerously
its
windows
broken
and
its
heavy
double
doors
sagging
on
their
hinges
staghorn
leers
and
peccary
glowers
were
not
for
the
scenery
however
but
for
the
people
who
wandered
aimlessly
through
the
little
park
and
along
the
street
beyond
carefully
avoiding
the
area
beneath
the
leaning
steeple
all
of
them
were
uniformly
young
ranging
from
perhaps
seventeen
at
one
extreme
to
no
more
than
thirty
at
the
other
when
peccary
had
first
seen
them
he
cried
out
joyfully
you
see
staghorn
all
young
all
handsome
then
he
stopped
talking
as
he
studied
those
in
the
foreground
more
closely
their
clothing
to
call
it
that
was
most
peculiar
it
was
rags
here
and
there
was
a
garment
that
bore
a
resemblance
to
a
dress
or
jacket
or
pair
of
trousers
but
for
the
most
part
the
people
simply
had
chunks
of
cloth
wrapped
about
them
in
a
most
careless
fashion
several
would
have
been
arrested
for
indecent
exposure
had
they
appeared
anywhere
except
on
humanac
screen
however
they
seemed
indifferent
to
this
and
to
all
else
a
singularly
attractive
girl
in
a
costume
that
would
have
made
a
cretan
blush
did
even
get
a
second
glance
from
a
young
adonis
who
passed
her
on
the
walk
nor
did
she
bestow
one
on
him
the
park
bench
held
more
interest
for
her
so
she
sat
down
on
it
peccary
studied
her
more
closely
then
straightened
with
a
start
i
be
damned
he
said
that
jenny
cheever
staghorn
continued
to
leer
at
the
girl
so
you
know
her
i
know
her
father
he
owns
the
local
variety
store
she
only
twenty
today
and
there
she
is
a
hundred
years
from
now
not
a
day
older
only
her
image
peccary
staghorn
murmured
only
her
image
but
a
very
pretty
one
peccary
came
to
his
feet
unable
to
control
his
irritation
any
longer
i
wo
believe
it
he
said
somehow
a
piece
of
misinformation
has
been
fed
into
that
machine
its
calculations
are
all
wrong
staghorn
refused
to
be
perturbed
but
you
just
said
you
recognize
the
girl
on
the
bench
i
say
that
humanac
has
to
be
working
with
accuracy
to
put
recognizable
people
into
a
prediction
then
shift
the
scene
for
all
i
know
this
part
of
town
was
turned
into
an
insane
asylum
fifty
years
from
now
the
use
of
the
past
tense
when
speaking
of
a
future
event
was
not
ungrammatical
in
the
presence
of
humanac
do
you
have
the
volume
up
certainly
ca
you
hear
the
birds
twittering
but
i
ca
hear
anyone
talking
perhaps
it
a
day
of
silence
staghorn
took
another
long
look
at
the
girl
on
the
parkbench
and
then
turned
to
the
controls
using
the
fine
adjustment
on
the
geographical
locator
the
screen
flickered
blinked
and
the
scene
changed
the
two
men
studied
it
recognize
it
said
staghorn
peccary
gave
an
affirmative
grunt
that
the
jefferson
grammar
school
on
elm
street
i
surprised
it
still
there
but
lord
as
long
as
they
have
built
a
new
one
you
think
they
at
least
keep
the
old
one
repaired
very
shabby
staghorn
agreed
it
was
large
areas
of
the
exterior
plaster
had
fallen
away
windows
were
shattered
and
here
and
there
the
broken
slats
of
venetian
blinds
stuck
through
them
the
shrubbery
around
the
building
was
dead
weeds
had
sprung
up
through
the
cracks
in
the
asphalt
in
the
big
play
yard
there
was
no
sign
of
children
where
is
everyone
peccary
demanded
you
must
have
the
time
control
set
for
a
sunday
or
holiday
it
tuesday
staghorn
said
then
both
were
silent
because
at
that
moment
a
child
appeared
a
boy
of
about
eleven
he
burst
from
the
schoolhouse
door
and
ran
across
the
cracked
asphalt
toward
the
playground
glancing
back
over
his
shoulder
as
though
expecting
pursuit
reaching
the
play
apparatus
he
paused
and
looked
around
desperately
the
metal
standards
for
the
swings
were
in
place
but
no
swings
hung
from
them
the
fulcrums
for
the
seesaws
were
there
but
they
held
no
wooden
planks
to
permit
teetering
the
only
piece
of
equipment
that
looked
capable
of
affording
pleasure
was
the
slide
it
was
a
small
one
only
about
six
feet
high
obviously
designed
for
toddlers
and
not
for
a
boy
of
eleven
nonetheless
the
boy
headed
for
it
eagerly
but
he
hardly
set
foot
upon
the
bottom
step
of
the
ladder
when
the
schoolhouse
door
burst
open
a
second
time
a
young
woman
charged
toward
him
shouting
paul
get
down
from
there
at
once
paul
she
was
an
attractive
woman
but
her
voice
held
a
note
of
panic
she
ran
so
swiftly
that
paul
whose
ascent
of
the
ladder
was
accelerated
rather
than
retarded
by
her
command
had
quite
reached
the
top
when
she
seized
him
around
the
legs
and
tried
to
drag
him
down
please
miss
terry
he
pleaded
desperately
just
this
once
let
me
get
to
the
top
let
me
slide
down
it
just
once
get
to
the
top
miss
terry
was
aghast
you
could
fall
and
kill
yourself
down
you
come
this
instant
just
one
time
paul
wailed
let
me
do
it
just
once
miss
terry
paid
no
heed
to
his
anguished
cries
she
tugged
at
his
legs
while
paul
clung
to
the
handrails
but
he
was
the
weaker
of
the
two
and
in
a
few
seconds
miss
terry
had
torn
him
loose
and
set
him
on
the
ground
then
seizing
him
firmly
by
the
hand
she
led
him
back
toward
the
schoolhouse
paul
went
along
sniveling
miserably
they
entered
the
building
and
the
play
yard
was
once
more
silent
and
deserted
by
god
staghorn
peccary
thundered
you
doctored
it
deliberately
fed
false
information
into
humanac
memory
cells
staghorn
turned
to
glare
at
his
guest
his
eyes
flaming
at
the
outrageous
suggestion
the
only
hypothetical
element
i
fed
into
humanac
is
your
y
hormone
peccary
you
saw
me
do
it
you
watched
me
check
the
computer
before
we
started
i
refuse
to
believe
that
my
y
hormone
will
bring
about
the
consequences
that
machine
is
predicting
it
the
only
new
factor
that
was
added
how
can
you
say
that
during
the
next
hundred
years
a
thousand
other
factors
can
enter
in
but
the
y
hormone
bears
an
essential
relationship
to
the
whole
sit
down
and
stop
waving
your
arms
i
going
to
see
if
we
can
get
into
the
school
peccary
sat
down
seething
it
had
been
a
mistake
to
bring
his
y
hormone
to
staghorn
it
was
simply
that
he
been
thinking
of
himself
as
such
a
benefactor
to
the
human
race
that
he
could
wait
to
see
a
sample
of
the
bright
future
he
intended
to
create
think
of
it
staghorn
he
said
happily
earlier
in
the
evening
the
phrase
is
long
and
time
is
fleeting
wo
mean
anything
any
more
artists
will
have
hundreds
of
years
to
paint
their
pictures
think
of
the
books
that
will
be
written
the
music
that
will
be
composed
the
magnificent
cities
that
will
be
built
everyone
will
have
time
enough
to
achieve
perfection
think
of
your
work
and
mine
live
long
enough
to
unravel
all
the
mysteries
of
the
universe
staghorn
had
said
nothing
instead
he
uncorked
the
small
bottle
peccary
had
given
him
and
sniffed
at
it
the
bottle
contained
a
sample
of
the
y
hormone
which
peccary
had
spent
many
years
developing
its
principal
ingredient
was
a
glandular
extract
from
insects
an
organic
compound
that
controlled
the
aging
process
if
administered
artificially
it
could
keep
insects
in
the
larval
stage
almost
indefinitely
peccary
great
contribution
had
been
to
synthesize
this
extract
which
affected
only
insects
with
protein
elements
that
could
be
assimilated
by
mammals
and
humans
it
had
required
years
of
experimentation
but
the
result
was
his
y
hormone
y
for
youth
in
his
laboratory
he
now
had
playful
kittens
that
were
six
years
old
and
puppies
that
should
have
been
fully
grown
dogs
the
only
human
so
far
experimented
on
was
himself
but
because
he
started
taking
the
hormone
only
recently
he
was
as
yet
unable
to
say
positively
that
it
was
responsible
for
the
splendid
health
he
was
enjoying
his
impatience
to
know
the
sociological
consequences
of
the
hormone
had
made
him
bring
a
sample
of
it
to
staghorn
after
sniffing
at
the
bottle
staghorn
had
poured
its
contents
into
humanac
analyzer
the
giant
computer
gurgled
and
belched
a
few
seconds
while
it
assessed
the
nature
of
the
formula
then
staghorn
connected
the
analyzer
with
the
machine
memory
units
as
far
as
humanac
was
concerned
the
y
hormone
was
now
an
accepted
part
of
human
history
but
except
for
this
one
added
factor
the
rest
of
humanac
vast
memory
was
solidly
based
upon
the
complete
known
history
of
the
earth
and
the
human
race
its
principles
of
operation
were
the
same
as
those
controlling
other
electronic
brains
which
could
be
programmed
to
predict
tides
weather
election
results
or
the
state
of
a
inventory
at
any
given
date
in
the
future
humanac
differed
chiefly
in
the
tremendously
greater
capacity
of
its
memory
cells
over
the
years
it
had
digested
thousands
of
books
codifying
and
coordinating
the
information
as
fast
as
it
was
received
its
photocells
had
recorded
millions
of
visual
impressions
its
auditory
units
had
absorbed
the
music
and
languages
of
the
centuries
and
its
methods
of
evaluation
had
been
given
a
strictly
human
touch
by
feeding
into
its
resistance
chambers
the
cephalic
wave
patterns
produced
by
the
brains
of
staghorn
colleagues
an
added
feature
though
by
no
means
an
original
one
was
the
screen
upon
which
humanac
produced
visually
the
events
of
the
time
and
place
for
which
the
controls
were
set
this
screen
was
simply
the
big
end
of
a
tube
similar
to
those
used
in
television
sets
it
was
adapted
from
electronic
computer
used
by
the
vanguard
tracking
center
to
produce
visual
predictions
of
the
orbits
of
artificial
satellites
staghorn
was
constantly
having
trouble
explaining
to
people
that
humanac
was
not
a
time
machine
that
could
look
into
the
past
or
future
its
pictures
of
past
events
were
based
upon
information
already
present
in
its
memory
cells
its
pictures
of
future
events
were
predictions
calculated
according
to
the
laws
of
probability
but
because
humanac
unlike
a
human
never
forgot
any
of
the
million
and
one
variables
impinging
upon
any
human
situation
its
predictions
were
startlingly
accurate
humanac
had
never
been
exposed
to
pictures
of
peccary
home
town
nor
to
those
of
a
girl
named
jenny
cheever
it
arrived
at
the
likeness
of
both
town
and
girl
through
a
purely
mathematical
process
staghorn
ultimate
purpose
in
building
the
machine
was
to
use
it
in
developing
a
true
science
of
history
because
humanac
was
only
a
machine
staghorn
could
alter
its
memory
at
will
by
removing
the
tiny
unit
upon
which
the
battle
of
hastings
was
recorded
and
then
english
history
without
it
he
could
find
out
what
actual
effect
that
particular
battle
had
he
was
surprised
to
discover
that
it
had
very
little
according
to
humanac
the
normans
would
have
conquered
england
anyway
a
few
months
later
at
another
time
while
reviewing
the
events
leading
up
to
the
american
revolution
humanac
had
produced
a
picture
of
benjamin
franklin
kissing
a
beautiful
young
woman
in
the
office
of
his
printing
shop
on
impulse
staghorn
removed
this
seemingly
insignificant
event
from
memory
and
then
turned
the
time
dial
forward
to
the
present
to
see
what
effect
if
any
the
episode
had
had
upon
history
to
his
amazement
with
that
single
kiss
missing
humanac
produced
a
picture
of
the
american
continent
composed
of
six
different
nations
speaking
french
german
chinese
hindu
arabic
and
muskogean
the
last
being
the
language
of
an
indian
nation
occupying
the
mississippi
valley
and
extending
northward
to
lake
winnepeg
it
served
as
a
buffer
state
between
the
hindus
and
chinese
in
the
west
and
the
french
germans
and
arabs
to
the
east
it
was
humanac
ability
to
predict
the
future
consequences
of
any
hypothetical
event
however
that
made
it
an
instrument
capable
of
revolutionizing
history
once
its
dependability
was
thoroughly
established
it
would
be
possible
for
a
secretary
of
state
to
submit
to
humanac
the
contents
of
a
note
intended
for
a
foreign
country
then
turn
the
time
controls
ahead
and
get
humanac
prediction
of
the
consequences
if
the
consequences
were
good
the
note
would
then
be
sent
if
they
were
bad
the
secretary
could
destroy
the
note
and
try
others
until
he
composed
one
that
produced
the
desired
result
humanac
flaw
was
that
it
had
no
way
of
explaining
the
predictions
produced
on
its
screen
it
merely
showed
what
would
happen
when
and
if
certain
things
were
done
it
left
it
up
to
the
human
operator
to
figure
out
why
things
happened
that
way
this
was
what
was
troubling
peccary
he
could
see
not
the
remotest
relationship
between
his
y
hormone
and
the
fact
that
a
mathematical
probability
named
miss
terry
should
refuse
another
mathematical
probability
named
paul
permission
to
climb
to
the
top
of
a
playground
slide
meanwhile
staghorn
had
been
using
the
fine
adjustment
on
the
geographic
locator
and
now
grunted
his
satisfaction
good
we
in
the
building
at
least
on
the
screen
was
a
dusky
corridor
on
either
side
of
it
were
classroom
doors
some
closed
some
ajar
staghorn
moved
his
hand
from
the
fine
adjustment
to
the
even
more
delicate
vernier
control
which
permitted
him
to
shift
the
geographic
focus
inches
at
a
time
the
focus
drifted
slowly
forward
to
one
of
the
doors
and
then
he
and
peccary
were
able
to
see
into
the
classroom
it
was
deserted
desks
were
thick
with
dust
books
yellow
with
age
were
strewn
on
the
floor
staghorn
hand
sought
the
vernier
control
again
the
picture
led
them
on
down
the
corridor
to
another
open
door
again
it
was
a
scene
of
desolation
this
can
have
nothing
to
do
with
my
y
hormone
peccary
insisted
then
why
is
your
picture
on
the
wall
there
staghorn
said
with
a
note
of
malicious
pleasure
peccary
looked
and
started
on
the
classroom
wall
was
a
faded
photograph
of
himself
except
that
he
was
wearing
a
different
suit
in
the
picture
he
looked
just
as
he
looked
at
the
present
moment
staghorn
got
a
closer
focus
on
the
photograph
so
that
peccary
could
read
the
legend
beneath
it
clarence
peccary
the
man
who
gave
the
world
the
y
all
right
then
said
peccary
somewhat
mollified
by
this
tribute
if
they
put
my
picture
on
school
room
walls
a
hundred
years
from
now
it
means
i
an
honored
man
a
man
the
world
admires
and
therefore
the
y
hormone
be
the
cause
of
all
this
desolation
i
found
that
humanac
reasoning
and
human
reasoning
differ
in
many
ways
said
staghorn
on
the
screen
they
were
out
in
the
corridor
again
when
from
somewhere
ahead
came
a
woman
voice
you
may
recite
now
paul
please
stand
up
ah
that
sounds
like
miss
terry
said
staghorn
he
fingered
the
vernier
control
the
focal
point
slid
forward
along
the
corridor
stand
up
and
recite
paul
miss
terry
said
more
sharply
i
think
they
in
the
room
on
the
left
said
peccary
ii
the
focus
shifted
to
the
open
door
and
then
peccary
and
staghorn
could
see
into
the
classroom
this
one
was
in
slightly
better
order
than
the
others
and
was
occupied
by
two
people
in
front
sat
miss
terry
obviously
the
teacher
and
at
one
of
the
desks
sat
paul
he
seemed
to
be
the
entire
class
at
miss
terry
urging
he
was
coming
to
his
feet
his
face
still
stained
with
tears
he
held
his
book
a
few
inches
from
his
nose
and
stared
over
the
top
of
it
sullenly
go
ahead
paul
said
miss
terry
sweetly
stubborn
i
waiting
paul
looked
at
his
book
and
read
from
it
in
a
monotone
enunciating
each
word
carefully
as
though
it
had
no
relationship
to
the
other
words
i
am
a
human
being
and
as
long
as
i
obey
the
six
rules
i
shall
live
forever
very
good
paul
now
read
the
six
rules
paul
sniffled
loudly
and
commenced
reading
again
rule
one
i
must
never
go
near
fire
or
my
clothing
may
catch
aflame
and
burn
me
up
rule
two
i
must
keep
away
from
deep
water
or
i
may
fall
in
and
drown
rule
three
i
must
stay
away
from
high
places
or
i
may
fall
and
dash
my
brains
out
he
paused
to
sniffle
and
wipe
his
nose
on
his
sleeve
then
sighed
and
continued
dismally
rule
four
i
must
never
play
with
sharp
things
or
i
may
cut
myself
and
bleed
to
death
rule
five
i
must
never
ride
horses
or
i
may
fall
off
and
break
my
neck
paul
paused
lowering
his
book
and
the
sixth
rule
said
miss
terry
go
ahead
and
read
the
sixth
rule
reluctantly
paul
lifted
his
book
rule
six
starting
when
i
must
take
peccary
y
hormone
once
a
week
to
keep
me
young
and
healthy
forever
excellent
paul
said
miss
terry
and
which
rule
were
you
breaking
just
now
on
the
playground
i
was
breaking
rule
three
paul
said
then
quoted
sadly
i
must
stay
away
from
high
places
or
i
may
fall
and
dash
my
brains
out
peccary
was
on
his
feet
stomping
around
in
front
of
the
computer
sheer
idiocy
he
muttered
he
does
have
any
brains
to
dash
out
i
admit
that
a
computer
with
sufficient
information
about
the
state
of
the
world
might
be
able
to
make
accurate
predictions
of
events
a
few
months
or
possibly
a
year
into
the
future
but
not
one
hundred
years
in
that
long
an
interval
even
the
most
trivial
error
could
distort
every
circuit
in
the
machine
he
jabbed
a
finger
toward
the
screen
where
paul
was
seated
at
his
desk
again
and
that
what
that
picture
is
a
distortion
i
not
going
to
let
it
influence
me
one
bit
in
what
i
intend
to
he
broke
off
because
of
what
was
happening
on
the
screen
from
somewhere
outside
the
school
building
came
the
wail
of
a
alarm
both
miss
terry
and
paul
were
on
their
feet
and
by
their
expressions
terrified
the
atavars
paul
cried
his
entire
body
shaking
to
the
basement
paul
miss
terry
face
was
blanched
as
she
grasped
paul
hand
and
headed
toward
the
door
but
halfway
there
both
came
to
a
halt
breathless
and
staring
a
powerful
bearded
man
strode
into
the
classroom
paul
and
miss
terry
fell
back
as
he
advanced
he
was
a
man
of
about
fifty
his
bushy
hair
shot
with
gray
his
eyes
cold
and
blue
he
was
followed
by
two
younger
men
who
studied
paul
and
miss
terry
with
interest
all
three
wore
rough
work
clothing
the
bearded
man
pointed
at
paul
there
the
boy
he
said
quietly
take
him
paul
let
out
a
shriek
of
terror
and
fled
into
a
corner
as
the
two
men
advanced
he
clawed
futilely
as
they
laid
hands
on
him
for
sake
shut
up
one
of
the
men
said
with
more
disgust
than
anger
he
pinioned
paul
arms
while
the
other
man
bound
them
together
with
a
strip
of
cloth
miss
terry
meanwhile
had
collapsed
into
her
chair
one
of
captors
glanced
at
her
and
spoke
to
the
bearded
man
what
about
her
the
bearded
man
stepped
close
to
miss
terry
and
put
a
hand
on
her
shoulder
she
recoiled
as
from
a
snake
how
old
are
you
he
asked
miss
terry
made
some
inarticulate
squeaks
and
the
man
spoke
more
sharply
when
were
you
born
two
thousand
four
she
managed
to
stutter
the
bearded
man
considered
this
and
shook
his
head
over
fifty
by
that
time
they
hopeless
leave
her
and
bring
the
boy
miss
terry
let
out
an
agonized
wail
of
protest
and
fainted
across
her
desk
one
of
the
men
slung
paul
over
his
shoulder
and
the
bearded
leader
led
the
group
from
the
room
amazing
murmured
staghorn
absolutely
amazing
one
never
knows
what
to
expect
pure
gibberish
said
peccary
then
betrayed
his
interest
by
saying
can
you
follow
them
i
trying
to
staghorn
worked
at
the
geographic
adjustment
and
finally
got
the
screen
focused
on
the
corridor
again
it
was
deserted
the
bearded
man
and
his
companions
had
already
departed
staghorn
touched
the
controls
again
the
screen
flickered
and
once
more
the
little
park
came
into
focus
but
now
it
too
was
deserted
none
of
the
ragged
men
and
women
were
in
sight
neither
in
the
park
nor
on
the
street
beyond
staghorn
twisted
the
focus
in
all
directions
without
discovering
anyone
that
whistle
we
heard
was
obviously
some
kind
of
alarm
he
said
everyone
must
be
in
hiding
from
the
atavars
whoever
they
are
i
strongly
suspect
that
bearded
fellow
of
being
one
you
might
as
well
shut
it
off
staghorn
peccary
said
coldly
it
too
much
nonsense
for
any
sane
man
to
swallow
and
unless
that
machine
can
provide
a
full
and
satisfactory
explanation
as
to
why
my
y
hormone
will
bring
about
the
conditions
depicted
on
that
screen
i
see
no
reason
to
keep
the
hormone
off
the
market
staghorn
turned
from
the
controls
to
study
his
companion
the
only
possible
way
that
humanac
could
give
us
the
entire
background
of
events
leading
up
to
what
we
just
seen
would
be
to
set
the
time
control
to
the
present
and
then
leave
the
machine
running
until
it
arrived
at
this
same
period
again
that
would
take
a
hundred
years
and
i
not
going
to
sit
here
that
long
what
more
i
not
going
to
touch
your
y
hormone
even
if
you
do
put
it
on
the
market
there
be
plenty
who
will
that
what
humanac
says
yes
peccary
gestured
despairingly
after
all
he
did
have
a
conscience
i
simply
do
believe
my
hormone
can
be
responsible
i
remind
you
that
your
picture
was
on
the
classroom
wall
and
that
the
sixth
rule
read
by
that
boy
indicated
that
he
was
supposed
to
start
using
your
hormone
when
he
reached
the
age
of
that
would
be
about
the
age
to
stop
growing
older
that
boy
is
nothing
but
a
mathematical
probability
that
all
you
and
i
are
staghorn
said
owlishly
mathematical
probabilities
despite
omar
nothing
exactly
like
either
of
us
has
ever
existed
before
or
will
exist
again
but
damn
it
staghorn
peccary
sat
down
his
face
in
his
hands
it
worth
millions
i
invested
years
of
work
and
all
the
money
i
could
scrape
together
i
do
see
anything
wrong
in
a
scientist
profiting
by
his
discoveries
and
to
keep
it
off
the
market
just
because
that
insane
computer
says
that
a
hundred
years
from
now
he
broke
off
glaring
at
humanac
screen
which
was
still
focused
on
the
deserted
park
it
simply
does
make
sense
the
machine
does
give
any
reasons
for
anything
if
there
were
a
way
i
could
talk
directly
to
some
of
those
mathematical
probabilities
question
them
ask
them
what
it
all
about
he
was
on
his
feet
striding
back
and
forth
before
the
computer
again
perhaps
there
is
a
way
staghorn
said
quietly
eh
i
said
that
it
may
be
possible
for
you
to
talk
with
them
how
by
making
your
mind
a
temporary
part
of
the
computer
peccary
studied
the
huge
machine
apprehensively
its
ranks
of
memory
units
its
chambers
of
flickering
tubes
the
labyrinth
of
circuits
how
would
you
go
about
it
i
put
you
in
the
transmitter
staghorn
said
he
stepped
away
from
the
console
and
slid
back
a
panel
to
reveal
a
niche
with
a
seat
in
it
above
the
seat
was
a
sort
of
helmet
that
resembled
a
hair
drier
in
a
beauty
parlor
except
that
it
was
studded
with
hundreds
of
tiny
magnets
and
transistors
staghorn
indicated
the
helmet
this
picks
up
and
amplifies
brain
waves
i
used
it
to
record
the
cephalic
wave
pattern
of
about
a
hundred
men
and
women
the
recordings
are
built
into
the
computer
enabling
humanac
to
assign
a
mathematical
evaluation
to
the
influence
of
human
emotion
in
making
historic
decisions
in
your
case
instead
of
making
a
recording
of
your
brain
waves
i
feed
the
impulses
directly
into
humanac
memory
units
and
what
would
happen
then
i
not
altogether
sure
said
staghorn
and
it
seemed
to
peccary
that
staghorn
was
finding
a
definite
relish
in
his
uncertainty
i
never
tried
the
experiment
before
i
might
get
electrocuted
no
there
no
danger
of
that
happening
the
current
that
activates
the
transmitter
comes
from
your
own
brain
and
as
you
know
such
electrical
impulses
are
extremely
feeble
that
is
what
worries
me
well
then
what
does
in
some
ways
humanac
behaves
peculiarly
like
a
living
organism
for
example
there
one
prediction
it
can
never
make
several
times
fed
into
it
the
hypothetical
information
that
the
two
opposing
factions
of
the
world
have
declared
war
naturally
everyone
would
like
to
know
about
the
outcome
of
such
a
war
staghorn
paused
gazing
lovingly
at
his
majestic
creation
and
what
happens
peccary
said
impatiently
nothing
that
just
it
the
moment
i
turn
humanac
into
the
future
to
get
a
prediction
the
screen
goes
dead
do
you
know
why
it
goes
dead
staghorn
looked
at
peccary
with
a
pleased
smile
and
did
wait
for
peccary
to
cue
him
it
goes
dead
because
if
war
were
declared
humanac
would
be
the
first
target
for
enemy
bombs
when
it
predicts
a
future
event
it
has
to
take
all
factors
into
consideration
if
one
of
those
factors
is
its
own
destruction
it
can
predict
nothing
beyond
that
moment
peccary
repeated
this
sentence
in
his
mind
while
he
slowly
digested
its
meaning
what
it
seemed
to
mean
was
that
although
staghorn
and
peccary
thought
of
humanac
as
only
a
complicated
machine
humanac
opinion
of
itself
was
altogether
otherwise
it
could
foresee
its
own
death
i
often
wonder
mused
staghorn
about
those
people
we
see
wandering
around
on
humanac
screen
to
us
they
only
images
made
by
a
stream
of
electrons
hitting
the
end
of
a
cathode
ray
tube
their
space
and
time
is
an
illusion
all
the
same
humanac
comprises
an
entire
system
a
system
modeled
as
accurately
as
possible
on
our
own
just
possible
that
the
boy
we
saw
paul
was
experiencing
a
real
terror
peccary
examined
staghorn
in
amazement
he
had
often
suspected
that
staghorn
genius
was
tinged
with
madness
you
not
suggesting
that
those
those
images
are
conscious
ah
what
is
consciousness
i
did
come
here
to
get
into
a
metaphysical
argument
no
but
it
only
fair
for
me
to
suggest
the
possible
emotional
hazzards
involved
in
hooking
you
up
to
humanac
because
you
have
to
admit
that
be
conscious
during
the
experiment
certainly
but
i
be
sitting
right
there
peccary
pointed
to
the
seat
in
the
transmitter
unit
in
a
sense
yes
very
well
take
your
seat
peccary
eyed
the
helmet
uneasily
i
not
sure
i
want
to
do
this
but
you
do
want
to
make
millions
from
the
y
hormone
and
you
want
to
enjoy
it
with
a
clear
conscience
perhaps
it
as
you
say
there
may
be
other
factors
involved
by
knowing
what
they
are
you
may
be
able
to
negate
their
influence
staghorn
voice
was
a
soft
purr
as
he
took
peccary
arm
and
urged
him
into
the
transmitter
unit
peccary
sat
down
the
seat
was
small
and
hard
just
bear
one
thing
in
mind
staghorn
said
do
get
lost
it
will
be
best
if
you
stay
in
the
little
park
where
i
can
see
you
and
where
you
be
in
focus
unless
you
in
focus
it
might
be
impossible
to
ah
disengage
you
peccary
could
find
no
meaning
whatsoever
in
this
statement
except
confirmation
of
his
suspicion
that
staghorn
was
mad
he
felt
this
so
strongly
that
he
started
to
rise
from
his
seat
and
escape
from
the
transmitter
cell
but
at
that
moment
staghorn
lowered
the
helmet
onto
his
head
the
sensation
he
experienced
was
so
novel
and
startling
that
he
remained
seated
for
a
second
or
two
he
could
feel
the
tiny
metallic
contacts
on
the
inside
of
the
helmet
pressing
against
his
skull
but
this
sensation
of
physical
pressure
vanished
almost
at
once
it
was
replaced
by
one
of
headlessness
his
body
up
to
his
chin
still
seemed
to
be
sitting
in
the
transmitter
but
his
intellect
had
lost
completely
its
sense
of
localization
in
the
head
he
could
think
clearly
enough
but
had
no
notion
as
to
the
spot
where
his
thoughts
originated
indeed
the
whole
concept
of
relative
position
seemed
ridiculous
at
the
same
instant
he
felt
tall
as
a
mountain
and
as
low
as
a
rug
his
mind
could
fill
the
entire
universe
while
resting
neatly
in
a
thimble
he
could
also
see
staghorn
for
his
eyes
continued
to
function
and
transmit
optical
patterns
but
precisely
where
he
was
while
receiving
these
patterns
he
could
possibly
say
he
heard
staghorn
remark
fine
the
connection
is
perfect
it
always
better
when
the
subject
is
bald
i
going
to
switch
you
over
into
humanac
circuits
now
staghorn
hand
moved
across
the
controls
and
one
of
his
long
fingers
flipped
a
switch
this
was
the
last
peccary
saw
of
roger
staghorn
instantly
he
found
himself
standing
in
the
center
of
the
small
park
in
his
home
town
his
reaction
was
not
one
of
alarm
quite
to
the
contrary
his
immediate
thought
was
one
of
surprise
that
he
was
alarmed
standing
there
in
the
little
square
felt
entirely
normal
and
proper
next
he
was
jolted
by
the
realization
that
he
must
be
an
image
on
humanac
screen
he
quickly
looked
about
in
all
directions
half
expecting
to
see
staghorn
huge
face
peering
down
from
the
sky
like
god
there
was
no
sign
of
staghorn
however
the
world
about
him
was
as
as
any
he
ever
known
he
was
in
his
home
town
a
hundred
years
after
he
last
seen
it
good
lord
he
was
a
hundred
and
years
old
this
realization
was
followed
by
a
host
of
others
like
a
man
coming
out
of
amnesia
his
past
began
filling
with
memories
he
was
rich
he
was
the
richest
man
on
earth
his
y
hormone
was
used
the
world
over
a
mile
away
on
the
outskirts
of
town
he
could
see
a
portion
of
his
huge
production
plant
he
lived
in
a
majestic
palace
surrounded
by
every
manner
of
automatic
protective
device
protection
from
what
and
how
had
he
dared
to
venture
out
here
in
the
park
alone
but
wait
wait
it
was
all
an
illusion
actually
he
was
only
an
image
on
screen
a
mathematical
probability
he
must
keep
that
fact
firmly
in
mind
or
he
might
lose
his
mental
balance
he
gazed
about
at
the
town
dismayed
by
its
appearance
not
a
person
in
sight
not
even
an
automobile
of
course
the
motor
car
might
have
become
obsolete
during
the
passage
of
a
hundred
years
there
must
be
some
new
mode
of
transportation
something
undreamed
of
a
century
ago
while
he
was
wondering
what
this
might
be
he
heard
a
and
was
astonished
to
see
three
horsemen
approaching
the
square
as
they
came
closer
he
recognized
them
as
the
bearded
man
and
his
two
companions
the
boy
paul
was
bound
firmly
behind
one
of
the
saddles
a
strange
panic
arose
in
peccary
breast
but
he
managed
to
suppress
it
with
a
reminder
that
this
was
all
illusion
he
was
here
for
purposes
of
information
he
must
have
the
courage
to
get
it
so
he
forced
himself
to
the
curb
at
the
edge
of
the
park
when
the
riders
were
within
speaking
distance
he
managed
to
hail
them
with
hey
you
his
nervousness
made
his
words
harsh
but
then
there
was
no
reason
why
he
should
speak
politely
to
kidnapers
he
saw
that
paul
was
conscious
the
boy
had
a
gag
over
his
mouth
but
his
eyes
were
open
the
three
riders
reined
in
their
horses
and
looked
at
peccary
with
frank
curiosity
here
one
that
did
hide
one
of
them
remarked
in
a
tone
that
peccary
decided
was
disrespectful
he
stepped
forward
boldly
may
i
ask
what
you
intend
to
do
with
that
boy
he
demanded
he
wants
to
know
what
we
intend
to
do
with
the
boy
said
the
same
man
yes
i
heard
what
he
said
the
bearded
man
remarked
quietly
he
had
ceased
to
study
peccary
with
his
piercing
blue
eyes
now
he
urged
his
horse
closer
you
must
be
a
stranger
here
son
not
exactly
said
peccary
as
a
matter
of
fact
i
was
born
here
that
was
some
time
ago
and
it
true
i
have
been
here
recently
the
way
the
bearded
man
stared
at
him
made
him
extremely
nervous
but
sure
that
kidnaping
is
against
the
law
if
you
do
release
that
boy
i
have
to
to
make
a
citizen
arrest
peccary
knew
that
his
words
sounded
ridiculous
from
the
way
the
three
riders
exchanged
glances
it
was
evident
that
they
thought
the
same
thing
he
going
to
make
a
citizen
arrest
commented
the
one
who
liked
to
repeat
whatever
peccary
said
hush
said
the
bearded
leader
and
then
to
peccary
what
your
name
son
clarence
peccary
if
you
do
do
as
i
say
i
he
stopped
short
his
heart
leaping
as
the
force
of
his
indiscretion
struck
him
the
three
men
had
been
struck
also
the
two
younger
ones
were
already
on
the
ground
one
on
either
side
of
him
only
the
bearded
man
remained
mounted
he
leaned
forward
i
thought
you
looked
familiar
you
peccary
of
the
y
hormone
his
voice
was
a
menacing
whisper
peccary
finally
answered
with
a
slow
nod
he
must
have
flipped
running
around
alone
like
this
a
man
beside
him
said
however
let
never
insult
fortune
this
was
the
last
peccary
heard
for
at
that
instant
one
of
the
men
he
never
knew
which
struck
him
forcibly
over
the
head
with
a
blunt
instrument
iii
at
humanac
controls
roger
staghorn
leaped
to
his
feet
in
alarm
as
he
saw
what
was
happening
on
the
screen
peccary
had
collapsed
now
the
two
men
were
draping
him
across
the
bearded
man
saddle
there
was
an
instant
to
lose
staghorn
leaped
to
the
transmitter
cell
where
peccary
material
body
was
seated
his
eyes
peacefully
closed
staghorn
flipped
the
switch
to
disengage
peccary
consciousness
from
humanac
circuits
nothing
happened
peccary
body
remained
as
before
blissfully
asleep
good
lord
of
course
nothing
happened
how
could
it
peccary
had
just
been
knocked
cold
at
the
moment
he
did
any
consciousness
staghorn
opened
the
circuit
again
and
whirled
back
to
the
control
console
he
looked
at
the
screen
all
three
men
were
mounted
again
the
bearded
leader
gestured
them
on
they
set
spurs
to
their
horses
and
galloped
away
taking
the
unconscious
peccary
with
them
no
staghorn
shouted
at
the
fleeing
images
no
peccary
stay
in
focus
the
horsemen
paid
no
heed
nor
did
staghorn
expect
them
to
rationally
his
shouts
were
only
involuntary
expressions
of
despair
grasping
the
geographic
locator
he
twiddled
it
wildly
managing
to
keep
the
three
riders
in
focus
for
several
blocks
as
they
sped
down
a
street
of
the
deserted
town
then
they
rounded
a
corner
and
he
lost
them
by
the
time
he
got
a
focus
on
the
area
around
the
corner
they
were
gone
for
several
minutes
he
continued
to
search
shifting
the
focal
point
all
over
town
but
in
vain
clarence
peccary
was
lost
inside
humanac
labyrinthean
brain
staghorn
was
stunned
there
would
be
no
difficulty
in
keeping
physical
body
alive
indefinitely
by
intravenous
feeding
but
it
was
as
good
as
dead
while
separated
from
its
sense
of
identity
worse
yet
were
the
probable
consequences
to
humanac
of
having
a
free
soul
loose
in
its
mathematical
universe
these
were
too
dire
to
contemplate
the
machine
reliability
might
be
altogether
ruined
and
staghorn
life
work
destroyed
under
the
circumstances
there
was
but
one
course
of
action
he
had
to
find
peccary
and
get
him
back
into
focus
so
that
he
could
be
disengaged
from
the
computer
first
staghorn
focused
the
geographic
locator
on
the
town
square
the
point
from
which
peccary
had
been
abducted
from
there
he
could
begin
tracking
him
next
he
set
the
time
control
so
that
it
would
automatically
disengage
the
transmitter
units
in
exactly
three
hours
whether
or
not
he
could
find
peccary
in
that
period
of
time
staghorn
had
no
way
of
knowing
but
at
least
he
should
be
able
to
get
himself
back
into
focus
at
the
proper
moment
then
in
case
he
failed
to
find
peccary
he
could
reset
the
time
clock
and
try
again
next
he
opened
a
second
transmitter
unit
sat
down
on
the
little
seat
and
pulled
the
helmet
down
on
his
head
as
sensations
of
vastness
and
lost
dimensions
spread
through
him
he
reached
out
and
pressed
down
the
switch
that
would
pour
his
own
brain
impulses
into
humanac
circuits
instantly
as
with
peccary
staghorn
found
himself
standing
in
the
little
park
he
examined
his
hands
and
slapped
his
sides
a
few
times
taking
time
to
assimilate
the
fact
that
he
felt
perfectly
solid
ah
bishop
berkeley
was
right
all
the
time
the
universe
was
subjective
a
creation
of
consciousness
he
left
off
these
speculations
and
recalled
himself
to
his
mission
glancing
around
he
saw
that
people
were
beginning
to
reappear
they
came
up
from
basements
and
out
of
the
doors
of
the
dilapidated
houses
and
buildings
if
there
had
been
a
panic
there
was
no
sign
of
it
now
the
men
and
women
moved
indolently
returning
toward
the
park
and
the
sunlit
streets
all
were
so
much
the
same
age
and
of
such
similar
beauty
that
it
was
difficult
to
distinguish
individual
members
of
the
same
sex
but
he
finally
recognized
the
girl
peccary
had
identified
as
jenny
cheever
she
had
an
attractive
strawberry
birthmark
on
her
hip
she
strolled
back
into
the
park
accompanied
by
a
young
man
the
two
of
them
took
possession
of
the
bench
where
jenny
had
been
seated
earlier
they
sat
well
apart
from
each
other
silently
contemplating
the
other
feeling
that
his
knowledge
of
jenny
name
constituted
a
sort
of
introduction
staghorn
approached
the
couple
the
man
paid
no
attention
to
him
but
jenny
watched
him
curiously
staghorn
was
not
a
man
over
whom
women
swooned
and
it
occurred
to
him
that
she
found
something
odd
about
his
dark
suit
and
thick
spectacles
he
seemed
to
be
the
only
man
in
town
wearing
either
how
do
you
do
he
said
to
her
i
believe
you
ben
daughter
she
continued
to
examine
him
languidly
slowly
stroking
a
heavy
strand
of
her
auburn
hair
am
i
she
said
at
last
it
been
so
long
forgotten
but
then
i
had
to
be
someone
daughter
and
since
my
name
is
cheever
you
may
be
right
i
do
remember
you
we
must
have
met
ages
and
ages
ago
this
is
the
first
time
we
met
you
were
pointed
out
to
me
by
a
friend
she
considered
this
with
a
puzzled
air
and
idly
curious
said
do
you
want
to
marry
me
good
heavens
no
jenny
did
seem
to
be
insulted
by
his
abruptness
i
just
wondered
why
you
speak
to
me
she
said
because
if
you
want
to
marry
me
you
have
to
wait
i
promised
to
marry
him
first
she
gestured
to
the
man
on
the
bench
with
her
the
man
looked
at
staghorn
for
the
first
time
yeah
he
said
i
see
said
staghorn
and
when
is
this
merry
event
to
take
place
some
day
jenny
said
indifferently
when
we
both
feel
like
it
there
no
use
rushing
things
i
do
want
to
use
up
all
the
men
too
soon
use
them
up
he
be
my
husband
yeah
said
the
man
she
be
my
wife
your
marriages
ca
last
very
long
said
staghorn
despite
the
physical
attractiveness
of
both
jenny
and
her
escort
staghorn
began
to
feel
clammy
in
their
presence
he
had
an
impression
of
deep
ill
health
a
sense
of
unclean
almost
reptilian
lassitude
they
get
shorter
all
the
time
said
jenny
and
turned
away
as
though
the
conversation
bored
her
the
man
too
had
lost
interest
staghorn
stood
ignored
for
a
moment
and
then
spoke
bluntly
who
are
the
atavars
the
word
produced
the
first
genuine
reaction
jenny
leaped
to
her
feet
the
man
turned
red
do
say
that
word
jenny
said
i
sorry
i
a
stranger
no
one
can
be
that
much
of
a
stranger
it
indecent
the
man
said
he
stood
up
and
touched
jenny
arm
i
feel
my
blood
pounding
let
go
get
married
jenny
nodded
and
with
a
cold
glance
at
staghorn
moved
away
with
her
companion
staghorn
was
tempted
to
follow
and
demand
an
answer
to
his
question
when
he
saw
miss
terry
approaching
miss
terry
was
more
likely
to
have
the
information
he
needed
and
in
any
case
since
she
was
only
in
her
fifties
she
was
less
than
half
of
jenny
cheever
age
he
hoped
this
would
make
a
difference
in
her
attitude
that
she
was
capable
of
emotion
he
already
knew
her
expression
as
she
approached
was
disconsolate
staghorn
bowed
low
before
her
and
introduced
himself
good
afternoon
miss
terry
i
a
stranger
to
you
but
since
you
a
teacher
by
profession
you
may
have
heard
of
me
i
roger
staghorn
he
straightened
twisted
his
lips
into
a
smile
and
waited
for
miss
terry
to
associate
his
name
with
those
scientific
achievements
that
had
so
startled
the
world
a
hundred
years
earlier
to
his
chagrin
miss
terry
only
gazed
at
him
blankly
and
shook
her
head
no
she
murmured
then
tears
formed
in
her
eyes
and
she
tried
to
move
on
staghorn
stopped
her
forgive
me
he
said
i
aware
of
your
recent
loss
your
pupil
paul
her
tears
dropped
more
freely
sooner
or
later
i
knew
they
get
him
the
only
child
in
town
and
now
i
have
nothing
to
do
nothing
at
all
they
just
who
are
they
the
atavars
miss
terry
turned
pale
do
say
it
she
pleaded
in
time
forget
but
where
have
they
taken
paul
and
what
will
they
do
with
him
he
die
of
course
she
spoke
these
words
almost
indifferently
then
wept
copiously
as
she
added
but
i
live
on
with
nothing
to
do
then
why
did
someone
stop
them
he
gestured
angrily
at
the
handsome
young
males
wandering
through
the
park
all
these
men
why
do
they
rescue
paul
this
suggestion
so
shocked
miss
terry
that
she
stopped
weeping
impossible
there
be
violence
someone
might
get
killed
they
think
of
with
a
boy
life
at
stake
staghorn
felt
his
rage
rising
he
was
an
irascible
man
by
nature
and
had
controlled
himself
so
far
only
because
he
knew
he
was
part
of
an
illusion
the
sense
of
illusion
was
fading
rapidly
however
the
guiding
principles
of
morals
and
ethics
were
themselves
abstractions
and
therefore
operated
just
as
powerfully
in
an
abstract
universe
he
grasped
miss
terry
by
the
arm
i
go
after
him
myself
where
do
i
find
him
you
ca
find
him
if
you
follow
they
capture
you
too
i
chance
that
where
have
they
gone
i
ca
tell
you
they
might
punish
me
staghorn
shook
her
heartily
ignoring
the
fact
that
she
was
over
fifty
tell
me
it
so
happens
that
besides
paul
they
captured
clarence
peccary
and
i
responsible
for
his
life
at
this
statement
miss
terry
let
out
a
cry
of
horror
they
caught
peccary
no
no
they
most
certainly
have
so
hurry
up
and
tell
me
we
all
die
wailed
miss
terry
we
all
die
in
that
case
it
ca
hurt
you
to
tell
me
the
mountains
cried
miss
terry
high
canyon
it
was
with
great
difficulty
that
staghorn
forced
directions
from
her
the
news
of
peccary
capture
had
unsettled
her
entirely
but
despite
the
roughness
with
which
he
was
forced
to
use
her
no
one
came
to
her
rescue
several
young
men
and
women
gathered
at
a
safe
distance
to
watch
but
they
did
nothing
to
interfere
staghorn
finally
elicited
the
information
that
high
canyon
was
several
miles
north
of
town
and
could
be
reached
by
following
a
dirt
road
to
his
inquiry
as
to
where
he
could
rent
a
car
miss
terry
went
blank
again
there
were
no
cars
they
had
been
abolished
before
miss
terry
was
born
she
thought
there
might
be
one
in
the
museum
staghorn
glanced
at
his
watch
he
already
been
in
the
transmitter
thirty
minutes
he
had
only
two
and
a
half
hours
to
get
to
high
canyon
rescue
peccary
and
paul
and
return
to
the
square
he
dared
not
cut
it
too
fine
he
have
to
be
back
with
a
few
minutes
to
spare
so
after
learning
the
location
of
the
museum
he
took
off
at
a
run
it
was
evident
that
at
some
period
in
the
past
the
town
had
gone
through
a
surge
of
prosperity
for
there
were
several
quite
majestic
buildings
whose
cornerstones
bore
dates
of
the
late
twentieth
century
but
it
was
also
clear
that
during
the
last
fifty
years
not
only
had
few
new
enterprises
been
started
but
the
old
ones
had
been
allowed
to
languish
the
museum
even
lacked
an
attendant
at
the
door
unless
one
gave
this
title
to
the
bust
of
peccary
which
stood
on
a
pedestal
just
inside
the
entrance
the
plaque
beneath
the
bust
noted
that
peccary
had
given
the
museum
to
the
city
in
to
preserve
for
our
immortal
posterity
a
true
picture
of
the
world
of
mortals
in
the
seven
and
a
half
decades
since
however
this
true
picture
had
suffered
badly
in
the
absence
of
curtains
and
draperies
and
in
the
nudeness
of
the
mannekins
whose
purpose
could
only
have
been
to
display
twentieth
century
costumes
staghorn
gained
a
hint
as
to
where
the
populace
got
at
least
a
part
of
the
rags
they
wore
he
did
pause
to
examine
details
however
a
wall
directory
with
a
faded
map
of
the
building
had
given
him
the
location
of
the
wing
of
twentieth
century
machines
he
headed
there
at
once
passing
by
displays
of
tractors
bulldozers
jackhammers
and
other
commonplaces
before
reaching
the
automobiles
there
was
an
excellent
selection
of
standard
and
sports
models
all
a
uniform
gray
under
their
coats
of
dust
and
all
of
them
out
of
gas
after
so
long
a
time
it
was
doubtful
if
any
would
have
run
anyway
he
had
simply
hoped
that
one
lone
attendant
might
have
kept
one
in
working
condition
in
the
next
room
however
he
found
the
reward
for
his
effort
bicycles
he
chose
a
racing
model
a
few
minutes
later
he
was
pedaling
rapidly
northward
on
the
dirt
road
that
led
to
high
canyon
iv
peccary
could
feel
fingers
probing
at
his
sore
head
a
bit
of
damp
cloth
or
cotton
was
pressed
against
his
upper
lip
the
sharp
odor
that
stabbed
his
nostrils
made
him
jerk
his
head
away
and
suck
in
his
breath
good
he
coming
around
peccary
opened
his
eyes
for
a
few
seconds
faces
and
objects
swung
around
him
giddily
but
finally
the
environment
achieved
stability
he
saw
that
he
was
in
a
log
cabin
on
a
bunk
seated
in
a
chair
beside
him
was
a
man
whose
manner
could
belong
only
to
a
doctor
standing
behind
the
doctor
was
the
bearded
man
he
be
all
right
the
doctor
said
packing
bottles
and
probes
into
his
little
black
bag
peccary
sat
up
and
touched
the
back
of
his
head
gingerly
it
was
very
very
sore
he
never
had
an
illusion
quite
like
this
before
besides
the
illusion
had
persisted
too
long
how
long
had
he
been
out
hours
days
good
lord
had
staghorn
deserted
him
the
bearded
man
ushered
the
doctor
out
locked
the
door
and
came
back
to
observe
peccary
he
put
a
booted
foot
on
the
chair
and
leaned
an
elbow
on
his
knee
i
hardly
need
tell
you
peccary
he
said
that
this
is
the
happiest
day
of
my
life
but
not
of
mine
peccary
responded
sourly
i
doubt
if
you
can
make
it
a
bit
worse
by
telling
me
what
this
is
all
about
and
what
you
plan
to
do
with
me
the
bearded
man
showed
surprise
you
do
know
no
i
do
know
peccary
was
losing
his
detachment
the
bearded
man
considered
him
thoughtfully
i
should
have
let
the
doctor
go
so
soon
apparently
you
were
hit
harder
than
we
thought
on
the
other
hand
it
just
possible
living
as
you
have
these
last
seventy
years
locked
up
in
your
palace
and
isolated
from
the
rest
of
the
world
that
you
lost
touch
with
what
is
going
on
i
lost
touch
with
a
great
many
things
obviously
i
a
prisoner
how
long
is
this
going
to
last
only
until
my
demolition
squad
is
ready
then
we
take
you
to
your
production
plant
where
you
produce
the
y
hormone
there
will
be
a
gun
at
your
back
of
course
you
know
the
combination
to
get
us
safely
past
the
automatic
guards
ah
i
waited
all
my
life
for
this
once
in
the
plant
my
men
will
do
the
rest
you
going
to
blow
it
up
absolutely
and
what
do
you
gain
by
that
the
formula
for
the
y
hormone
still
exists
the
bearded
man
laughed
yes
i
can
see
you
been
out
of
touch
with
the
world
it
been
thirty
years
since
the
country
produced
anyone
capable
of
working
with
that
formula
that
when
the
last
university
closed
down
thirty
years
ago
that
shocking
said
peccary
but
my
experiments
showed
conclusively
that
the
y
hormone
has
no
deleterious
effect
upon
intelligence
i
took
every
precaution
nothing
wrong
with
anyone
intelligence
said
the
bearded
man
except
that
no
one
under
pressure
to
use
it
when
the
future
stretches
on
indefinitely
it
gets
easier
and
easier
to
put
things
off
until
tomorrow
even
education
until
finally
it
put
off
forever
there
only
one
man
living
who
understands
that
formula
and
who
is
that
the
bearded
man
looked
down
at
him
hatefully
yourself
peccary
that
why
we
so
delighted
to
capture
you
because
now
you
never
use
it
again
peccary
stared
at
him
aghast
i
understand
now
you
mean
to
steal
it
you
mean
to
force
it
out
of
me
and
start
producing
the
y
hormone
yourself
this
accusation
resulted
in
a
violent
reaction
from
the
bearded
man
he
grasped
peccary
by
the
lapels
of
his
jacket
and
hauled
him
to
his
feet
peccary
could
feel
the
man
powerful
hands
trembling
with
rage
you
fool
you
utter
imbecile
do
you
even
yet
know
who
we
are
peccary
was
so
throttled
by
the
man
clutch
that
he
could
only
waggle
his
head
in
the
negative
the
bearded
man
face
came
close
to
his
we
mortals
he
flung
peccary
back
on
the
bunk
contemptuously
we
accept
our
allotted
span
of
years
and
call
it
quits
but
during
that
time
we
live
we
have
to
it
all
the
time
we
have
he
glared
at
peccary
a
moment
before
resuming
in
a
milder
tone
after
we
destroy
your
production
plant
peccary
we
going
to
kill
you
you
might
as
well
know
it
the
only
way
to
make
certain
that
the
formula
for
the
y
hormone
will
never
be
used
again
then
he
smiled
but
take
consolation
with
the
plant
destroyed
you
gradually
get
old
and
die
anyway
for
the
brief
period
before
we
execute
you
you
might
even
regain
an
appreciation
for
life
he
bent
suddenly
gripped
wrist
and
hauled
him
to
his
feet
again
in
fact
you
might
have
forgotten
what
life
is
i
refresh
your
memory
come
along
he
dragged
peccary
to
the
door
opened
it
and
led
him
outside
peccary
looked
around
he
found
himself
on
the
level
floor
of
a
canyon
whose
vertical
walls
rose
high
on
either
side
he
recognized
the
place
at
once
often
when
he
was
a
boy
he
come
here
to
camp
overnight
it
had
been
a
delightful
wilderness
with
a
stream
the
canyon
had
changed
some
forty
cabins
like
the
one
he
been
in
were
built
in
the
shade
of
the
southern
cliff
and
the
canyon
floor
was
covered
with
green
crops
and
pasture
he
heard
singing
laughter
people
were
at
work
in
the
fields
children
were
building
rock
castles
at
the
base
of
the
cliff
on
a
cabin
porch
two
elderly
men
sat
playing
checkers
the
last
of
the
mortals
said
the
bearded
man
if
there
are
any
other
colonies
we
do
know
of
them
but
when
you
gone
peccary
they
be
the
first
of
a
new
race
you
asked
earlier
what
we
intended
to
do
with
the
boy
we
kidnaped
there
he
is
and
he
pointed
toward
the
canyon
wall
peccary
looked
and
saw
paul
climbing
upward
along
crevices
and
ledges
the
bearded
man
cupped
his
hands
to
his
mouth
and
shouted
paul
how
is
it
the
boy
straightened
on
a
rocky
pinnacle
and
looked
back
his
face
was
ecstatic
i
climbing
he
crowed
i
never
been
so
high
climbing
all
the
way
to
the
top
he
waved
and
clambered
on
once
in
a
great
while
a
child
is
born
to
one
of
the
immortals
the
bearded
man
said
if
we
find
him
in
time
we
can
save
him
peccary
watched
the
boy
move
upward
along
the
cliff
then
why
was
he
so
terrified
when
you
captured
him
because
he
had
it
pounded
into
him
that
if
the
atavars
got
him
he
die
he
will
too
eventually
like
any
other
mortal
but
in
the
meanwhile
he
broke
off
and
turned
on
peccary
savagely
you
see
there
one
thing
you
did
consider
at
all
the
y
hormone
stops
aging
and
keeps
people
healthy
but
it
ca
protect
them
from
accidents
the
immortals
can
still
die
if
they
get
hit
by
a
train
or
fall
overboard
in
the
middle
of
the
ocean
a
mortal
can
accept
the
possibility
of
accidental
death
because
he
knows
he
going
to
die
anyway
sooner
or
later
but
ca
you
see
the
psychological
shock
to
the
immortals
when
one
of
them
dies
a
man
who
had
the
potential
of
living
forever
suddenly
wiped
out
it
like
the
end
of
the
world
and
so
they
started
eliminating
hazards
automobiles
went
first
then
planes
and
trains
they
were
needed
anyway
because
people
stopped
traveling
to
travel
is
to
court
accident
but
one
precaution
breeds
another
and
before
long
people
were
avoiding
all
dangerous
occupations
with
immortality
at
stake
even
the
smallest
risk
was
too
much
planing
mills
machine
shops
mines
smelters
bah
name
me
an
occupation
that
occasionally
entail
some
hazard
even
motherhood
but
i
anticipated
the
need
for
birth
control
i
had
the
plans
all
set
up
there
was
birth
control
all
right
but
not
the
way
you
planned
it
ten
years
after
your
hormone
went
on
the
market
the
world
had
an
extra
five
billion
people
for
a
few
years
they
produced
a
surge
of
energy
until
the
older
immortals
started
eliminating
the
hazards
after
that
starvation
set
in
of
the
population
died
your
hormone
ca
keep
people
from
starving
either
and
it
was
a
shock
from
which
those
who
survived
never
recovered
every
new
mouth
to
feed
was
a
threat
childbirth
practically
stopped
but
that
left
the
remaining
immortals
in
a
very
soft
position
for
years
now
they
been
existing
on
the
leftovers
from
civilization
finding
shelter
in
the
old
houses
ransacking
the
attics
and
closets
of
the
dead
for
scraps
of
clothing
daring
to
plant
a
few
crops
in
areas
where
they
grow
with
little
care
and
after
that
boredom
he
thrust
an
accusing
finger
at
peccary
and
you
dared
to
use
the
slogan
to
achieve
perfection
i
tell
you
peccary
the
source
of
man
courage
and
energy
is
the
knowledge
of
death
man
was
meant
to
be
mortal
we
strive
because
we
know
the
time
is
short
we
climb
mountains
make
love
descend
to
the
depths
of
the
sea
and
reach
for
the
stars
because
the
certainty
of
death
urges
us
on
it
the
only
certainty
the
world
had
and
you
would
destroy
it
peccary
quailed
before
the
bearded
man
ferocity
he
was
relieved
when
his
captor
attention
was
diverted
by
a
party
of
horsemen
who
rode
up
in
neat
order
and
stopped
before
their
leader
several
horses
were
loaded
with
explosives
we
ready
sir
their
spokesman
said
good
said
the
bearded
man
i
see
no
reason
to
delay
an
instant
an
extra
horse
had
been
provided
for
peccary
he
was
on
the
point
of
being
forcibly
hoisted
into
the
saddle
when
he
was
given
a
reprieve
by
a
diversion
of
another
kind
approaching
on
the
path
through
the
center
of
the
canyon
pedaling
his
bicycle
frantically
came
staghorn
he
rode
up
to
the
group
and
leapt
from
his
seat
his
face
blue
from
exertion
he
been
climbing
all
the
way
from
town
he
stood
gasping
for
breath
while
he
dragged
his
big
gold
watch
from
his
pocket
and
consulted
the
time
he
managed
a
groan
only
thirty
minutes
left
miles
to
go
but
it
down
hill
all
the
way
we
can
make
it
he
shoved
his
bicycle
forward
on
the
handlebars
peccary
quick
peccary
would
have
liked
nothing
better
but
his
movement
toward
staghorn
was
stopped
instantly
by
the
men
who
were
trying
to
put
him
on
his
horse
they
going
to
kill
me
he
cried
they
going
to
blow
up
my
factory
and
kill
me
no
no
said
staghorn
that
ca
be
the
consequences
would
be
disastrous
he
turned
to
the
bearded
leader
look
sir
i
have
no
time
to
explain
and
i
sure
you
would
believe
me
even
if
i
did
all
of
you
are
illusions
this
entire
situation
is
nothing
but
a
mathematical
probability
and
so
i
insist
that
you
release
my
friend
peccary
at
once
the
bearded
man
was
so
amazed
by
this
request
that
he
forgot
to
take
offense
he
gaped
at
staghorn
who
are
you
i
ca
imagine
an
immortal
risking
himself
on
a
bicycle
at
this
moment
i
desperately
mortal
and
so
is
dr
peccary
nonsense
peccary
is
a
hundred
and
years
old
i
told
you
this
situation
has
no
existence
in
reality
the
bearded
man
stomped
the
ground
i
been
living
on
this
planet
years
i
know
reality
when
i
see
it
and
what
more
beginning
to
think
you
one
of
the
immortals
even
an
immortal
might
show
some
courage
when
he
knows
he
going
to
be
deprived
of
the
y
hormone
if
you
must
know
i
roger
staghorn
i
can
see
that
industry
and
education
in
this
canyon
and
so
it
possible
you
heard
of
me
i
have
quite
a
record
of
scientific
achievements
back
in
the
twentieth
century
at
this
announcement
the
bearded
man
goggled
at
him
then
threw
back
his
head
and
laughed
uproariously
you
could
have
picked
a
worse
masquerade
roger
staghorn
died
in
i
ca
help
that
i
staghorn
the
bearded
man
stopped
laughing
and
thrust
his
face
forward
threateningly
you
a
fraud
because
it
so
happens
that
staghorn
you
staghorn
i
henry
staghorn
of
the
real
roger
staghorn
impossible
i
have
no
intention
of
ever
getting
married
roger
staghorn
married
when
he
founded
the
atavars
ninety
years
ago
he
saw
the
need
of
leaving
mortal
offspring
and
sacrificed
himself
to
that
end
and
he
buried
in
the
cliff
over
there
furthermore
he
became
peccary
most
bitter
enemy
if
he
were
alive
today
be
tying
the
knot
for
peccary
neck
instead
of
trying
to
rescue
him
the
bearded
man
drew
a
revolver
from
inside
his
jacket
i
think
execute
you
here
and
now
peccary
all
but
fainted
if
staghorn
were
killed
all
hope
was
gone
but
staghorn
threw
up
a
commanding
hand
stop
henry
what
you
say
may
be
perfectly
true
from
your
peculiar
viewpoint
but
i
still
roger
staghorn
are
you
going
to
shoot
your
own
staghorn
tone
rather
than
his
words
made
the
bearded
man
pause
he
turned
to
a
companion
and
in
that
instant
staghorn
moved
after
all
he
was
slightly
younger
and
more
agile
than
his
he
leapt
onto
his
bicycle
shouting
at
peccary
turn
around
peccary
whirled
and
sprang
in
the
air
as
staghorn
aimed
the
bicycle
between
his
legs
he
landed
neatly
on
the
handlebars
and
with
simultaneous
kicks
sent
the
men
on
either
side
sprawling
then
he
and
staghorn
were
off
down
the
canyon
behind
them
they
could
hear
the
thundering
hoofs
as
the
horsemen
started
in
pursuit
go
staghorn
go
peccary
shouted
the
race
would
have
been
lost
at
once
except
for
the
downhill
grade
but
because
of
it
peccary
added
weight
was
a
help
instead
of
a
hindrance
shots
rang
out
bullets
bounced
from
the
rocks
on
either
side
they
made
it
out
of
the
canyon
mouth
and
the
grade
increased
on
the
long
straightaway
toward
town
staghorn
feet
spun
as
they
darted
downward
maintaining
their
lead
in
front
of
the
pursuing
horsemen
the
town
loomed
ahead
of
them
closer
and
closer
until
at
last
they
sped
into
a
street
where
the
buildings
gave
them
protection
from
bullets
the
bicycle
slowed
they
were
on
level
ground
again
staghorn
skidded
around
a
corner
and
stopped
so
suddenly
that
peccary
was
propelled
forward
and
landed
on
his
feet
at
the
mouth
of
an
alley
abandoning
the
bicycle
both
men
charged
into
it
the
square
staghorn
gasped
i
focused
on
the
square
he
hauled
out
his
watch
as
he
ran
only
seven
minutes
remained
the
alarm
whistle
was
sounding
over
the
town
its
inhabitants
must
have
sighted
the
approach
of
the
atavars
for
they
were
scurrying
into
buildings
and
basements
leaving
the
way
clear
for
peccary
and
staghorn
they
emerged
from
the
alley
and
turned
left
for
a
block
then
doubled
back
as
they
were
sighted
by
the
searching
horsemen
the
hue
and
cry
was
on
again
but
peccary
familiarity
with
his
home
town
served
them
well
until
they
came
within
sight
of
the
square
then
they
stopped
in
dismay
and
ducked
into
a
doorway
across
the
street
in
the
center
of
the
little
park
as
though
divining
that
it
must
be
their
destination
was
staghorn
and
three
of
his
men
their
position
enabled
them
to
watch
all
four
approaches
to
the
square
at
the
same
time
staghorn
tugged
out
his
watch
again
two
minutes
they
had
to
be
in
focus
a
second
late
and
they
be
locked
forever
he
watched
the
second
hand
creep
around
the
dial
we
have
to
chance
it
he
said
when
i
start
running
run
with
me
the
second
hand
crept
on
a
minute
left
staghorn
judged
the
distance
from
their
hiding
place
to
the
grassy
plot
where
the
bearded
man
was
standing
about
yards
could
he
do
yards
in
ten
seconds
could
peccary
thirty
seconds
left
twenty
he
never
gone
through
such
a
painful
fifteen
seconds
ready
peccary
it
now
or
never
thirteen
twelve
eleven
go
staghorn
burst
from
his
hiding
place
with
peccary
at
his
heels
they
dashed
for
the
square
they
were
over
the
curb
and
into
the
street
before
the
men
in
the
park
saw
their
approach
and
let
out
cries
of
triumph
dip
and
weave
peccary
dip
and
weave
they
dipped
and
wove
while
bullets
ripped
at
their
clothing
they
were
running
right
into
the
fire
making
better
targets
at
every
stride
staghorn
ran
with
his
watch
in
his
hand
and
never
had
time
and
distance
diminished
so
slowly
seven
seconds
six
five
and
they
were
still
alive
and
across
the
street
four
seconds
three
two
they
were
over
the
park
and
onto
the
grass
a
bullet
crashed
into
staghorn
leg
and
he
fell
diving
forward
got
him
cried
his
now
get
peccary
three
shots
rang
out
as
one
but
at
some
point
in
the
bullets
flight
toward
peccary
and
staghorn
the
square
and
everything
in
it
vanished
staghorn
found
himself
sitting
in
humanac
transmitter
unit
the
time
clock
had
functioned
he
was
disengaged
he
lifted
the
helmet
from
his
head
and
stumbled
from
the
cell
drawing
a
trouser
leg
up
to
examine
his
leg
it
seemed
that
he
could
detect
a
scar
then
he
turned
and
helped
peccary
from
the
other
transmitter
both
men
stepped
toward
the
console
to
look
at
humanac
screen
it
was
still
focused
on
the
little
park
the
bearded
man
and
his
companions
were
now
exchanging
glances
of
consternation
after
a
moment
the
bearded
man
wet
his
lips
maybe
he
was
right
he
said
in
awed
tones
no
one
but
my
could
ever
do
a
trick
like
that
and
maybe
what
he
said
is
true
it
all
illusion
we
nothing
but
mathematical
probabilities
at
this
point
staghorn
hauled
down
the
master
switch
the
screen
went
dead
as
humanac
power
was
shut
off
some
twenty
minutes
later
he
had
finished
draining
peccary
sample
of
the
y
hormone
from
humanac
analyzer
and
had
thoroughly
cleansed
the
computer
of
any
last
traces
of
it
he
handed
the
little
bottle
of
the
hormone
back
to
peccary
there
he
said
as
far
as
humanac
is
concerned
it
as
though
it
never
was
do
as
you
wish
peccary
looked
at
the
bottle
sadly
it
was
worth
millions
billions
then
slowly
he
moved
to
a
laboratory
sink
and
poured
the
contents
of
the
bottle
down
the
drain
i
ca
help
wondering
mused
staghorn
of
whose
computer
we
a
part
right
now
slight
factors
in
the
chain
of
causation
that
started
god
knows
when
and
will
end
when
someone
pulls
the
switch
said
peccary
