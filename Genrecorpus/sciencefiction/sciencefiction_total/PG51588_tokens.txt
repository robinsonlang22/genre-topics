extensive
research
did
not
uncover
any
evidence
that
the
copyright
on
this
publication
was
renewed
i
had
something
better
than
investing
for
the
future
the
future
investing
in
me
my
mother
warned
me
marilyn
said
again
to
think
twice
before
i
married
a
child
prodigy
look
for
somebody
good
and
solid
she
said
like
dad
somebody
who
will
put
something
away
for
your
old
age
i
tapped
a
transistor
put
a
screwdriver
across
a
pair
of
wires
and
watched
the
spark
marilyn
was
just
talking
to
pass
the
time
she
really
loves
me
and
does
mind
too
much
that
i
spend
my
spare
time
and
money
building
a
time
machine
sometimes
she
even
believes
that
it
might
work
she
kept
talking
i
been
thinking
we
past
thirty
now
and
what
do
we
have
a
lease
on
a
restaurant
where
nobody
eats
and
a
time
machine
that
does
work
she
sighed
and
a
drawerful
of
pawn
tickets
we
never
be
able
to
redeem
my
silver
my
camera
my
typewriter
i
added
a
growl
to
her
sigh
my
microscope
my
other
equipment
uncle
johnson
will
have
them
for
old
age
she
said
sadly
and
we
be
lucky
if
we
have
i
felt
a
pang
of
resentment
uncle
johnson
it
seemed
that
every
time
i
acquired
something
uncle
johnson
soon
came
into
possession
of
it
been
kids
together
although
he
was
quite
a
few
years
older
a
hulking
lout
in
the
sixth
grade
while
i
was
in
the
first
and
i
graduated
from
grammar
school
a
term
ahead
of
him
of
course
i
went
on
to
high
school
and
had
a
college
degree
at
fifteen
being
a
prodigy
johnson
went
to
work
in
his
uncle
pawn
shop
sweeping
the
floor
and
so
on
and
when
we
started
calling
him
uncle
this
was
much
of
a
job
because
johnson
uncle
got
him
to
work
for
almost
nothing
by
promising
he
would
leave
him
the
pawn
shop
when
he
died
and
it
did
look
as
if
much
would
come
of
this
because
the
uncle
was
not
very
old
and
he
was
always
telling
people
a
man
afford
to
die
these
days
what
with
the
prices
undertakers
were
charging
before
i
had
even
started
to
shave
i
had
a
dozen
papers
published
in
scientific
journals
all
having
to
do
with
the
nature
of
time
time
travel
became
my
ambition
and
i
was
sure
i
saw
a
way
to
build
a
time
machine
but
it
took
years
to
work
out
the
details
and
nobody
seemed
interested
in
my
work
so
i
had
to
do
it
all
myself
somehow
i
stopped
working
long
enough
to
get
a
wife
and
we
had
to
eat
so
we
ran
this
little
hash
house
and
lived
in
the
back
room
and
at
least
we
got
our
food
wholesale
and
johnson
uncle
fell
down
the
cellar
stairs
and
split
his
skull
open
so
johnson
became
the
owner
of
a
thriving
business
after
giving
his
uncle
a
simple
funeral
because
he
knew
his
uncle
would
have
wanted
him
to
waste
any
more
money
on
that
than
he
had
to
but
we
have
a
time
machine
marilyn
said
fondly
that
something
johnson
would
give
us
a
lot
on
if
it
worked
we
have
a
time
machine
i
said
looking
around
at
my
work
our
kitchen
was
the
time
machine
with
a
great
winding
of
wires
around
it
to
create
the
field
i
had
devised
the
doors
had
been
a
problem
that
i
solved
by
making
them
into
switches
so
that
when
they
were
closed
the
coils
made
the
complete
circuit
of
the
room
almost
i
repeated
after
twenty
years
of
work
i
am
through
except
for
a
few
small
items
i
looked
at
her
pleadingly
it
will
run
about
twenty
dollars
do
you
think
she
did
care
much
for
the
idea
but
finally
she
slid
off
the
wedding
ring
you
redeem
this
first
thing
ted
before
any
of
the
rest
of
the
stuff
i
promised
and
took
off
at
a
dead
run
johnson
did
have
to
inspect
the
ring
he
seen
it
before
and
he
counted
out
twenty
dollars
that
was
the
only
item
he
give
me
a
decent
price
on
he
knew
i
be
back
for
it
how
the
time
machine
coming
along
ted
he
had
a
little
smirk
the
way
some
people
do
when
they
hear
i
building
a
time
machine
get
in
touch
with
mars
yet
i
have
no
interest
in
mars
i
told
him
i
plan
to
make
contact
with
the
future
about
thirty
years
from
now
and
for
your
information
the
time
machine
is
practically
finished
the
first
test
will
be
tonight
he
was
smirking
now
because
he
never
forgot
the
way
i
passed
him
in
school
and
he
had
a
good
respect
for
my
brain
he
looked
a
little
thoughtful
only
a
little
because
that
all
he
was
capable
of
you
get
to
the
future
ted
suppose
you
bring
me
a
newspaper
make
it
worth
your
while
i
always
treated
you
fair
and
square
ted
now
have
i
i
looked
over
his
shelves
too
many
of
those
items
were
mine
and
i
did
have
to
be
a
telepath
to
know
what
he
was
thinking
maybe
you
like
a
paper
with
the
stock
market
quotations
uncle
from
about
thirty
years
from
now
say
the
smirk
was
completely
gone
now
you
get
something
like
that
ted
i
pay
you
would
help
you
out
any
because
you
have
nothing
to
invest
me
now
i
could
buy
something
that
will
keep
me
in
my
old
age
i
give
you
a
hundred
bucks
for
something
like
that
i
laughed
at
him
a
hundred
dollars
uncle
always
had
his
nerve
he
was
scowling
when
i
left
still
trying
to
figure
how
he
could
get
in
on
the
gravy
because
outside
of
marilyn
he
was
the
only
person
who
ever
thought
i
might
succeed
marilyn
cooked
dinner
for
us
while
i
was
putting
the
final
touches
on
the
time
machine
tonight
we
celebrate
she
said
steak
it
smelled
wonderful
but
the
occasional
whiff
of
ozone
from
my
equipment
was
more
exciting
i
told
marilyn
we
had
about
an
hour
before
i
could
make
the
test
but
with
my
working
faster
than
i
had
expected
and
her
getting
behind
with
the
meal
she
was
just
putting
the
steaks
on
the
table
when
i
was
done
with
the
machine
oh
but
let
eat
first
ted
she
said
i
could
eat
after
so
much
work
i
stared
in
fascination
at
the
master
switch
the
door
this
is
it
marilyn
what
i
been
working
toward
all
these
years
she
saw
the
way
i
felt
and
maybe
she
was
a
little
excited
herself
go
ahead
ted
she
told
me
i
closed
the
door
there
was
more
ozone
and
a
blurring
in
the
middle
of
the
room
we
stepped
away
from
the
thickest
of
the
blurring
where
something
seemed
to
be
gathering
substance
the
something
we
soon
saw
was
a
man
sitting
in
a
chair
surrounded
by
strange
apparatus
most
of
which
i
could
guess
the
purpose
of
it
was
a
very
young
man
when
i
could
see
him
better
probably
nineteen
wearing
bright
clothes
in
what
i
figured
must
be
the
style
of
he
said
this
time
machine
is
low
fahrenheit
right
to
the
bottom
it
the
deepest
i
blinked
parlez
vous
francais
marilyn
said
i
think
he
means
he
likes
it
but
who
is
he
and
just
where
did
he
come
from
the
gaily
dressed
youth
got
out
of
the
chair
and
smiled
at
us
each
of
his
shoulders
had
padding
the
size
of
a
football
his
coat
tapered
from
four
feet
wide
at
the
shoulders
to
a
tightly
bound
waist
the
lapels
from
a
foot
at
the
top
to
zero
the
trousers
widened
out
to
wide
stiff
hoops
that
ended
six
inches
above
his
shoes
and
the
shoes
but
at
least
they
were
really
alive
as
i
had
thought
at
first
how
is
it
asked
marilyn
that
a
cool
cat
from
the
future
comes
to
visit
us
in
a
time
machine
i
would
expect
a
more
scholarly
type
not
so
the
angleheads
do
reach
the
real
science
the
scientist
pros
believe
that
all
knowledge
is
known
they
delve
not
into
the
regions
of
thought
that
is
done
by
us
amateurs
he
did
a
short
bit
of
syncopated
tap
and
introduced
himself
i
am
solid
chuck
richards
ambassador
to
the
past
courtesy
of
the
friday
night
bull
session
and
experimentation
society
are
they
all
like
you
i
asked
no
some
are
deep
some
are
high
on
the
scale
but
all
of
them
reach
together
on
one
thing
they
all
feel
that
the
have
grown
angular
and
lost
the
sense
of
wonder
so
we
gather
together
on
friday
nights
to
work
on
the
side
of
science
we
read
your
books
if
you
are
ted
langer
i
admitted
it
he
danced
a
rhythmic
circle
around
me
staring
in
what
was
evidently
adoration
and
kept
murmuring
reach
that
deep
man
ted
langer
the
father
of
time
travel
deep
real
deep
now
see
here
i
finally
broke
in
do
they
talk
english
where
you
come
from
and
just
how
do
you
come
to
be
here
anyway
i
built
a
time
machine
to
travel
into
the
future
and
instead
i
get
you
telling
me
how
deep
i
am
are
you
here
or
am
i
there
you
are
here
and
i
also
am
here
but
to
explain
this
i
may
have
to
use
some
angle
talk
which
is
what
you
mean
by
english
we
read
your
books
which
are
collectors
items
by
the
way
and
we
decided
you
were
way
under
the
zero
mark
especially
when
we
saw
that
the
angleheads
would
touch
any
of
your
ideas
so
we
got
together
and
made
our
time
machine
but
i
am
sad
to
report
that
your
theory
was
a
bit
less
than
correct
there
were
a
few
errors
which
we
found
it
was
something
of
a
shock
to
hear
this
future
tell
me
there
were
mistakes
in
my
work
and
i
started
to
argue
with
him
about
it
but
his
attention
was
on
the
conversation
he
was
sniffing
thoughtfully
the
thing
he
called
sense
of
wonder
shining
in
his
eyes
he
was
looking
at
the
steaks
marilyn
had
set
on
the
table
reach
that
he
said
awed
solid
flesh
i
have
seen
a
steak
like
that
in
all
my
life
so
naturally
we
invited
him
to
sit
down
at
the
table
and
he
did
have
to
be
asked
more
than
once
it
seemed
that
food
was
pretty
expensive
in
which
is
the
year
he
came
from
and
what
there
was
of
it
mostly
came
from
factories
where
they
shoveled
soy
beans
and
yeast
into
a
machine
and
it
came
out
meat
at
the
other
end
if
you
did
make
too
much
fuss
about
what
you
called
meat
but
with
so
much
of
the
good
farm
land
ruined
by
atomic
dust
and
so
much
more
turned
into
building
lots
on
account
of
the
growing
population
it
was
the
best
they
could
do
when
we
heard
this
we
pushed
the
second
steak
in
front
of
him
and
he
showed
he
was
a
growing
boy
by
finishing
every
scrap
along
with
a
double
order
of
french
frieds
and
half
a
dozen
ears
of
corn
on
the
cob
but
he
had
to
give
up
after
two
pieces
of
pie
he
sat
back
in
the
chair
patted
his
stomach
and
looked
as
if
he
had
just
won
the
irish
sweepstakes
he
looked
at
the
big
refrigerator
when
marilyn
opened
it
to
put
things
away
his
eyes
almost
popped
out
at
the
sight
of
the
meat
stored
there
he
said
you
must
be
rich
marilyn
laughed
no
not
rich
far
from
it
we
operate
a
restaurant
and
that
our
stock
you
see
oh
i
should
not
have
eaten
so
much
what
do
you
charge
for
a
meal
like
that
we
would
get
three
and
a
half
for
each
order
i
said
diplomatically
not
mentioning
all
his
side
orders
although
we
do
get
much
carriage
trade
here
but
do
let
it
worry
you
nothing
too
good
for
a
guest
from
the
future
three
and
a
half
he
looked
amazed
why
such
a
feed
would
bring
or
thirty
where
i
come
from
if
you
could
find
it
let
me
pay
at
least
your
price
and
he
pulled
out
some
bills
i
started
to
push
them
back
for
of
course
i
was
going
to
spoil
this
great
moment
in
my
life
by
asking
a
traveler
from
the
future
to
pay
for
a
meal
but
then
i
saw
what
he
was
trying
to
give
me
i
picked
up
the
bills
and
stared
marilyn
head
was
over
my
shoulder
and
she
was
staring
just
as
hard
she
took
one
out
of
my
hand
it
not
real
she
said
there
not
that
much
money
in
the
world
she
had
the
five
i
had
the
ones
the
and
the
bills
that
is
i
looked
up
at
solid
chuck
richards
when
you
said
that
meal
would
cost
or
thirty
did
you
mean
or
thirty
you
reach
me
man
inflation
you
know
it
terrible
i
remember
when
a
gee
would
keep
the
beat
rocking
in
a
juke
palace
for
an
hour
now
you
pay
half
a
gee
a
number
it
terrible
after
we
explained
to
him
that
the
inflation
was
even
worse
than
that
he
decided
it
was
something
more
than
terrible
it
seems
he
had
paid
much
attention
to
money
in
his
younger
days
though
he
did
recall
now
that
when
he
was
very
small
he
been
able
to
get
a
good
nickel
candy
bar
for
twenty
dollars
but
he
had
seen
anything
smaller
than
a
hundred
in
some
time
now
there
should
be
a
law
against
this
sort
of
thing
he
said
indignantly
it
enough
to
turn
a
man
into
an
anglehead
the
way
they
keep
pushing
up
the
price
of
fumes
and
what
they
charge
for
bulgy
sanders
records
he
picked
up
the
bills
and
looked
at
them
but
i
think
maybe
we
can
find
a
way
to
profit
on
this
i
have
a
deep
thought
we
members
of
the
friday
night
bull
session
and
experimentation
society
will
come
to
your
restaurant
and
pay
you
five
gees
for
a
steak
dinner
which
is
a
fine
price
for
you
but
very
little
for
us
in
that
way
we
will
eat
good
food
and
you
will
gather
a
good
bundle
of
the
stuff
of
life
there
was
a
thudding
noise
at
the
window
i
looked
over
quick
somebody
was
hanging
on
outside
off
balance
as
if
he
had
been
standing
on
a
ladder
outside
and
had
fallen
against
the
window
i
ran
for
the
door
forgetting
it
was
a
switch
but
solid
chuck
richards
realized
it
he
dived
back
into
his
chair
and
called
reach
you
later
he
disappeared
as
i
pulled
the
door
open
the
sudden
flash
as
the
time
machine
stopped
operating
reminded
me
about
those
switches
on
the
door
but
it
was
too
late
now
i
ran
out
and
around
the
side
just
in
time
to
see
a
figure
disappearing
up
the
alley
sure
enough
there
was
a
ladder
against
the
window
i
did
bother
chasing
the
man
very
far
because
after
a
fast
look
at
him
i
had
a
pretty
good
idea
who
it
was
i
speak
to
him
later
marilyn
and
i
sat
around
looking
at
the
big
bills
they
were
the
size
of
currency
and
were
beautifully
made
and
would
have
passed
easily
except
for
a
few
things
such
as
that
series
inscribed
alongside
the
signature
of
irving
walcourt
secretary
of
the
treasury
and
the
treasurer
of
the
united
states
in
would
be
kuru
hamonoto
from
the
state
of
hawaii
i
wondered
or
they
no
use
to
us
at
all
said
marilyn
unless
we
hold
them
until
i
was
talking
about
security
for
our
old
age
do
you
suppose
you
forget
i
said
that
steak
will
run
you
or
thirty
thousand
in
this
is
going
to
be
a
great
disappointment
to
the
members
of
the
friday
night
bull
session
and
experimentation
society
but
i
fear
we
must
explain
to
solid
chuck
richards
that
we
just
can
not
afford
to
do
much
business
of
this
type
i
pushed
aside
the
money
and
began
thinking
about
some
of
the
things
the
youth
from
had
told
me
there
were
holes
in
my
theories
a
lot
of
holes
true
i
had
succeeded
in
building
a
time
machine
but
i
could
never
go
anyplace
in
it
because
time
travel
was
possible
only
by
traveling
from
one
time
machine
to
another
the
amateurs
of
knowing
from
my
books
i
must
remember
to
write
them
that
i
had
built
a
time
machine
in
were
able
to
make
contact
solid
chuck
richards
was
selected
by
lot
from
several
volunteers
to
try
the
machine
i
met
the
other
members
of
the
society
later
and
learned
that
and
a
number
of
other
things
from
them
the
reason
solid
chuck
came
back
instead
of
my
going
forward
made
solid
sense
i
could
see
it
now
my
time
machine
had
never
existed
in
his
had
existed
in
or
at
least
its
parts
had
i
could
overcome
that
problem
if
i
had
the
full
power
of
the
sun
for
several
minutes
to
work
with
and
a
way
to
handle
it
then
i
could
change
things
so
that
my
time
machine
would
have
existed
in
the
future
even
the
verb
tenses
were
going
wrong
on
me
these
amateur
experimenters
it
seemed
were
considered
a
bit
on
the
crackpot
side
taking
such
as
mine
seriously
not
knowing
enough
science
to
realize
that
the
ideas
i
wrote
about
were
impossible
as
any
professional
scientist
would
have
they
followed
them
through
they
tried
to
get
in
touch
with
me
in
their
time
but
i
was
available
which
saved
me
another
paradox
suppose
i
had
joined
the
society
and
come
back
as
a
volunteer
but
it
was
encouraging
to
know
the
reason
i
was
going
to
be
unavailable
in
marilyn
and
i
had
gone
on
a
second
honeymoon
on
the
first
commercial
passenger
liner
to
mars
and
so
i
told
her
you
do
have
to
worry
about
security
in
your
old
age
tickets
to
mars
must
cost
a
few
trillion
dollars
we
wo
be
poor
marilyn
was
still
looking
at
the
currency
of
the
future
we
will
be
she
said
if
we
keep
selling
steak
for
the
price
of
hamburger
by
the
way
ted
i
wonder
who
that
was
at
the
window
the
answer
came
to
me
then
i
put
the
bills
into
my
pocket
and
kissed
her
we
will
not
have
to
eat
hamburger
and
i
will
take
you
to
mars
for
your
second
honeymoon
as
soon
as
they
start
passenger
service
i
am
going
out
to
make
a
down
payment
on
the
tickets
right
now
uncle
johnson
took
the
glass
from
his
eye
he
looked
very
tense
like
a
fisherman
with
a
prize
catch
on
a
very
thin
line
it
good
he
said
and
his
voice
trembled
a
little
i
suppose
your
time
machine
worked
surprised
are
you
uncle
yes
yes
but
i
see
your
situation
ted
you
of
course
ca
afford
to
hold
these
for
thirty
years
now
ah
i
can
and
i
be
glad
to
help
you
out
by
taking
them
off
your
hands
naturally
i
have
to
hold
them
a
long
time
so
let
say
twenty
dollars
a
thousand
let
not
say
that
i
took
the
bill
from
his
hand
i
figure
fifty
is
a
fair
price
there
be
lots
more
uncle
and
as
you
say
i
am
always
broke
and
can
not
afford
to
put
them
away
for
my
old
age
but
running
the
time
machine
is
expensive
and
i
ca
afford
to
take
less
than
fifty
he
looked
as
if
he
were
going
to
snatch
the
bill
right
out
of
my
hand
he
was
so
eager
all
right
ted
i
realize
there
are
expenses
we
compromised
on
forty
but
i
want
a
promise
he
said
emphatically
i
to
be
the
only
one
you
sell
these
bills
to
you
reach
me
i
handed
him
the
bills
you
deep
man
real
deep
real
deep
in
the
hole
that
is
he
mortgaged
his
house
and
his
regular
inventory
to
buy
up
all
the
money
i
began
taking
in
once
we
redeemed
the
wedding
ring
and
all
the
other
articles
i
got
to
feeling
mellow
and
even
a
bit
grateful
he
started
me
in
business
so
to
speak
i
could
stick
him
with
all
those
millions
that
would
just
about
buy
him
a
helicab
ride
to
the
poorhouse
in
so
when
marilyn
and
i
got
just
as
deep
in
the
black
because
the
society
members
gave
us
some
books
on
statistics
i
started
giving
uncle
tips
every
now
and
then
not
free
of
course
i
asked
for
half
and
we
settled
on
with
that
plus
the
ones
i
bought
both
for
now
and
the
long
pull
i
guess
we
the
only
people
living
today
who
can
be
sure
of
having
a
second
honeymoon
on
mars
although
solid
chuck
richards
tells
me
he
hears
mars
is
overrated
there
not
being
a
juke
on
the
whole
planet
and
even
if
there
were
you
could
jump
to
any
decent
kind
of
beat
in
that
low
gravity
i
would
say
so
to
solid
chuck
richards
but
that
sounds
like
absolute
zero
to
me
