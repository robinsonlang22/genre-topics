soldiers
badly
roughed
up
in
the
biggest
war
going
this
war
is
the
change
war
a
war
of
time
travelers
in
fact
our
private
name
for
being
in
this
war
is
being
on
the
big
time
our
soldiers
fight
by
going
back
to
change
the
past
or
even
ahead
to
change
the
future
in
ways
to
help
our
side
win
the
final
victory
a
billion
or
more
years
from
now
a
long
killing
business
believe
me
you
do
know
about
the
change
war
but
it
influencing
your
lives
all
the
time
and
maybe
you
had
hints
of
it
without
realizing
have
you
ever
worried
about
your
memory
because
it
does
seem
to
be
bringing
you
exactly
the
same
picture
of
the
past
from
one
day
to
the
next
have
you
ever
been
afraid
that
your
personality
was
changing
because
of
forces
beyond
your
knowledge
or
control
have
you
ever
felt
sure
that
sudden
death
was
about
to
jump
you
from
nowhere
have
you
ever
been
scared
of
ghosts
not
the
kind
but
the
billions
of
beings
who
were
once
so
real
and
strong
it
hard
to
believe
just
sleep
harmlessly
forever
have
you
ever
wondered
about
those
things
you
may
call
devils
or
demons
spirits
able
to
range
through
all
time
and
space
through
the
hot
hearts
of
stars
and
the
cold
skeleton
of
space
between
the
galaxies
have
you
ever
thought
that
the
whole
universe
might
be
a
crazy
dream
if
you
have
you
had
hints
of
the
change
war
how
i
got
recruited
into
the
change
war
how
it
conducted
what
the
two
sides
are
why
you
do
consciously
know
about
it
what
i
really
think
about
it
you
learn
in
due
course
the
place
outside
the
cosmos
where
i
and
my
pals
do
our
nursing
job
i
simply
call
the
place
a
lot
of
my
nursing
consists
of
amusing
and
humanizing
soldiers
fresh
back
from
raids
into
time
in
fact
my
formal
title
is
entertainer
and
i
got
my
silly
side
as
you
find
out
my
pals
are
two
other
gals
and
three
guys
from
quite
an
assortment
of
times
and
places
we
a
pretty
good
team
and
with
sid
bossing
we
run
a
pretty
good
recuperation
station
though
we
have
our
family
troubles
but
most
of
our
troubles
come
slamming
into
the
place
with
the
soldiers
who
generally
just
been
going
through
hell
and
want
to
raise
some
of
their
own
as
a
matter
of
fact
it
was
three
newly
arrived
soldiers
who
started
this
thing
i
going
to
tell
you
about
this
thing
that
showed
me
so
much
about
myself
and
everything
when
it
started
i
had
been
on
the
big
time
for
a
thousand
sleeps
and
two
thousand
nightmares
and
working
in
the
place
for
five
thousand
this
routine
every
time
you
lay
down
your
dizzy
little
head
is
rough
but
you
pretend
to
get
used
to
it
because
being
on
the
big
time
is
supposed
to
be
worth
it
the
place
is
midway
in
size
and
atmosphere
between
a
large
nightclub
where
the
entertainers
sleep
in
and
a
small
zeppelin
hangar
decorated
for
a
party
though
a
zeppelin
is
one
thing
we
have
had
yet
you
go
out
of
the
place
but
not
often
if
you
have
any
sense
and
if
you
are
an
entertainer
like
me
into
the
cold
light
of
a
morning
filled
with
anything
from
the
earlier
dinosaurs
to
the
later
spacemen
who
look
strangely
similar
except
for
size
solely
on
doctor
orders
i
have
been
on
cosmic
leave
six
times
since
coming
to
work
at
the
place
meaning
i
have
had
six
brief
vacations
if
you
care
to
call
them
that
for
believe
me
they
are
busman
holidays
considering
what
goes
on
in
the
place
all
the
time
the
last
one
i
spent
in
renaissance
rome
where
i
got
a
crush
on
cesare
borgia
but
i
got
over
it
vacations
are
for
the
birds
anyway
because
they
have
to
be
fitted
by
the
spiders
into
serious
operations
of
the
change
war
and
you
can
imagine
how
restful
that
makes
them
see
those
soldiers
changing
the
past
you
stick
along
with
them
go
too
far
up
front
though
but
do
wander
off
either
relax
and
enjoy
yourself
ha
now
the
kind
of
recuperation
soldiers
get
when
they
come
to
the
place
is
a
horse
of
a
far
brighter
color
simply
dazzling
by
comparison
entertainment
is
our
business
and
we
give
them
a
time
and
send
them
staggering
happily
back
into
action
though
once
in
a
great
while
something
may
happen
to
throw
a
wee
shadow
on
the
party
i
am
dead
in
some
ways
but
do
let
that
bother
you
i
am
lively
enough
in
others
if
you
met
me
in
the
cosmos
you
would
be
more
apt
to
yak
with
me
or
try
to
pick
me
up
than
to
ask
a
cop
to
do
same
or
a
father
to
douse
me
with
holy
water
unless
you
are
one
of
those
reformer
types
but
you
are
not
likely
to
meet
me
in
the
cosmos
because
bar
basin
street
and
the
prater
century
italy
and
augustan
rome
until
they
spoiled
it
are
my
favorite
ha
vacation
spots
and
as
i
have
said
i
stick
as
close
to
the
place
as
i
can
it
is
really
the
nicest
place
in
the
whole
change
world
crisis
i
even
of
it
capitalized
anyhoo
when
this
thing
started
i
was
twiddling
my
thumbs
on
the
couch
nearest
the
piano
and
thinking
it
was
too
late
to
do
my
fingernails
and
whoever
came
in
probably
would
notice
them
anyway
the
place
was
jumpy
like
it
always
is
on
an
approach
and
the
gray
velvet
of
the
void
around
us
was
curdled
with
the
uneasy
lights
you
see
when
you
close
your
eyes
in
the
dark
sid
was
tuning
the
maintainers
for
the
and
the
right
shoulder
of
his
gray
doublet
was
streaked
where
he
been
wiping
his
face
on
it
with
quick
ducks
of
his
head
beauregard
was
leaning
as
close
as
he
could
over
sid
other
shoulder
one
knee
neatly
indenting
the
rose
plush
of
the
control
divan
and
he
was
missing
a
single
flicker
of
sid
old
fingers
on
the
dials
beau
besides
piano
player
beau
face
had
that
dead
blank
look
it
must
have
had
when
every
double
eagle
he
owned
and
more
he
did
were
riding
on
the
next
card
to
be
turned
in
the
gambling
saloon
on
one
of
those
mississippi
steamboats
doc
was
soused
as
usual
sitting
at
the
bar
with
his
top
hat
pushed
back
and
his
knitted
shawl
pulled
around
him
his
wide
eyes
seeing
whatever
horrors
a
life
in
czarist
russia
can
add
to
being
a
drunk
demon
in
the
change
world
maud
who
is
the
old
girl
and
lili
the
new
girl
of
course
were
telling
the
big
beads
of
their
identical
pearl
necklaces
you
might
say
that
all
us
entertainers
were
a
bit
edgy
being
demons
does
automatically
make
us
brave
then
the
red
telltale
on
the
major
maintainer
went
out
and
the
door
began
to
darken
in
the
void
facing
sid
and
beau
and
i
felt
change
winds
blowing
hard
and
my
heart
missed
a
couple
of
beats
and
the
next
thing
three
soldiers
had
stepped
out
of
the
cosmos
and
into
the
place
their
first
three
steps
hitting
the
floor
hard
as
they
changed
times
and
weights
they
were
dressed
as
officers
of
hussars
as
we
been
advised
and
praise
the
bonny
dew
i
saw
that
the
first
of
them
was
erich
my
own
dear
little
commandant
the
pride
of
the
von
hohenwalds
and
the
terror
of
the
snakes
behind
him
was
some
roman
or
other
and
beside
erich
and
shouldering
into
him
as
they
stamped
forward
was
a
new
boy
blond
with
a
face
like
a
greek
god
who
just
been
touring
a
christian
hell
they
were
uniformed
exactly
alike
in
black
shakos
pelisses
boots
and
so
forth
with
white
skull
emblems
on
the
shakos
the
only
difference
between
them
was
that
erich
had
a
caller
on
his
wrist
and
the
new
boy
had
a
glove
on
his
left
hand
and
was
clenching
the
mate
in
it
his
right
hand
being
bare
like
both
of
erich
and
the
roman
you
made
it
lads
hearts
of
gold
sid
boomed
at
them
and
beau
twitched
a
smile
and
murmured
something
courtly
and
maud
began
to
chant
shut
the
door
and
the
new
girl
copied
her
and
i
joined
in
because
the
change
winds
do
blow
like
crazy
when
the
door
is
open
even
though
it
ca
ever
be
shut
tight
enough
to
keep
them
from
leaking
through
shut
it
before
it
blows
wrinkles
in
our
faces
maud
called
in
her
gamin
voice
to
break
the
ice
looking
like
a
skinny
in
the
tight
frock
she
copied
from
the
new
girl
but
the
three
soldiers
were
paying
attention
the
roman
i
remembered
his
name
was
mark
was
blundering
forward
stiffly
as
if
there
were
something
wrong
with
his
eyes
while
erich
and
the
new
boy
were
yelling
at
each
other
about
a
kid
and
einstein
and
a
summer
palace
and
a
bloody
glove
and
the
snakes
having
saint
petersburg
erich
had
that
taut
sadistic
smile
he
gets
when
he
wants
to
hit
me
the
new
boy
was
in
a
tearing
rage
why
you
pull
us
out
so
bloody
fast
we
fair
chewed
the
nevsky
prospekt
to
pieces
galloping
away
did
you
feel
their
stun
guns
when
they
sprung
the
trap
too
soon
sei
erich
demanded
i
did
the
new
boy
told
him
not
enough
to
numb
a
cat
why
did
you
show
us
action
shut
up
i
your
leader
i
show
you
action
enough
you
wo
you
a
filthy
nazi
coward
engl√§nder
bloody
hun
the
blond
lad
knew
enough
german
to
understand
that
last
crack
he
threw
back
his
pelisse
to
clear
his
sword
arm
and
he
swung
away
from
erich
which
bumped
him
into
beau
at
the
first
sign
of
the
quarrel
beau
had
raised
himself
from
the
divan
as
quickly
and
silently
as
a
no
i
wo
use
that
word
and
slithered
over
to
them
sirs
you
forget
yourselves
he
said
sharply
off
balance
supporting
himself
on
the
new
boy
upraised
arm
this
is
sidney
place
of
entertainment
and
recuperation
there
are
ladies
with
a
contemptuous
snarl
the
new
boy
shoved
him
off
and
snatched
with
his
bare
hand
for
his
saber
beau
reeled
against
the
divan
it
caught
him
in
the
shins
and
he
fell
toward
the
maintainers
sid
whisked
them
out
of
the
way
as
if
they
were
a
couple
of
beach
radios
simply
nothing
in
the
place
is
nailed
down
and
had
them
back
on
the
coffee
table
before
beau
hit
the
floor
meanwhile
erich
had
his
saber
out
and
had
parried
the
new
boy
first
wild
slash
and
lunged
in
return
and
i
heard
the
scream
of
steel
and
the
rutch
of
his
boot
on
the
pavement
beau
rolled
over
and
came
up
pulling
from
the
ruffles
of
his
shirt
bosom
a
derringer
i
knew
was
some
other
weapon
in
disguise
a
stun
gun
or
even
an
atropos
besides
scaring
me
damp
for
erich
and
everybody
that
brought
me
up
short
us
entertainers
nerves
must
be
getting
as
naked
as
the
soldiers
probably
starting
when
the
spiders
canceled
all
cosmic
leaves
twenty
sleeps
back
sid
shot
beau
his
look
of
command
rapped
out
i
handle
this
you
whoreson
firebrand
and
turned
to
the
minor
maintainer
i
noticed
that
the
telltale
on
the
major
was
glowing
a
reassuring
red
again
and
i
found
a
moment
to
thank
mamma
devi
that
the
door
was
shut
maud
was
jumping
up
and
down
cheering
i
do
know
which
nor
did
she
i
bet
and
the
new
girl
was
white
and
i
saw
that
the
sabers
were
working
more
businesslike
erich
flicked
flicked
flicked
again
and
came
away
from
the
blond
lad
cheek
spilling
a
couple
of
red
drops
the
blond
lad
lunged
fiercely
erich
jumped
back
and
the
next
moment
they
were
both
floating
helplessly
in
the
air
twisting
like
they
had
cramps
i
realized
quick
enough
that
sid
had
shut
off
gravity
in
the
door
and
stores
sectors
of
the
place
leaving
the
rest
of
us
firm
on
our
feet
in
the
refresher
and
surgery
sectors
the
place
has
sectional
gravity
to
suit
our
extraterrestrial
buddies
those
crazy
ets
sometimes
come
whooping
in
for
recuperation
in
very
mixed
batches
from
his
central
position
sid
called
out
kindly
enough
but
taking
no
nonsense
all
right
lads
you
had
your
fun
now
sheathe
those
swords
for
a
second
or
so
the
two
black
hussars
drifted
and
contorted
erich
laughed
harshly
and
neatly
obeyed
the
commandant
is
used
to
free
fall
the
blond
lad
stopped
writhing
hesitated
while
he
glared
upside
down
at
erich
and
managed
to
get
his
saber
into
its
scabbard
although
he
turned
a
slow
somersault
doing
it
then
sid
switched
on
their
gravity
slow
enough
so
they
would
get
sprained
landing
erich
laughed
lightly
this
time
and
stepped
out
briskly
toward
us
he
stopped
to
clap
the
new
boy
firmly
on
the
shoulder
and
look
him
in
the
face
so
now
you
get
a
good
scar
he
said
the
other
did
pull
away
but
he
did
look
up
and
erich
came
on
sid
was
hurrying
toward
the
new
boy
and
as
he
passed
erich
he
wagged
a
finger
at
him
and
gayly
said
you
rogue
next
thing
i
was
giving
erich
my
man
you
home
hug
and
he
was
kissing
me
and
cracking
my
ribs
and
saying
doppchen
which
was
fine
with
me
because
i
do
love
him
and
i
a
good
lover
and
as
much
a
doubleganger
as
he
is
we
had
just
pulled
back
from
each
other
to
get
a
breath
his
blue
eyes
looked
so
sweet
in
his
worn
face
when
there
was
a
thud
behind
us
with
the
snapping
of
the
tension
doc
had
fallen
off
his
bar
stool
and
his
top
hat
was
over
his
eyes
as
we
turned
to
chuckle
at
him
maud
squeaked
and
we
saw
that
the
roman
had
walked
straight
up
against
the
void
and
was
marching
along
there
steadily
without
gaining
a
foot
like
it
does
happen
his
black
uniform
melting
into
that
gray
maud
and
beau
rushed
over
to
fish
him
back
which
can
be
tricky
the
thin
gambler
was
all
courtly
efficiency
again
sid
supervised
from
a
distance
what
wrong
with
him
i
asked
erich
he
shrugged
overdue
for
change
shock
and
he
was
nearest
the
stun
guns
his
horse
almost
threw
him
you
should
have
seen
saint
petersburg
the
nevsky
prospekt
the
canals
flying
by
like
reception
carpets
of
blue
sky
a
cavalry
troop
in
blue
and
gold
that
blundered
across
our
escape
fine
women
in
furs
and
ostrich
plumes
a
monk
with
a
big
tripod
and
his
head
under
a
hood
it
gave
me
the
horrors
seeing
all
those
zombies
flashing
past
and
staring
at
me
in
that
sick
unawakened
way
they
have
and
knowing
that
some
of
them
say
the
photographer
might
be
snakes
our
side
in
the
change
war
is
the
spiders
the
other
side
is
the
snakes
though
all
of
us
spiders
and
snakes
alike
are
doublegangers
and
demons
too
because
we
cut
out
of
our
lifelines
in
the
cosmos
your
lifeline
is
all
of
you
from
birth
to
death
we
doublegangers
because
we
can
operate
both
in
the
cosmos
and
outside
of
it
and
demons
because
we
act
reasonably
alive
while
doing
so
which
the
ghosts
do
entertainers
and
soldiers
are
all
whichever
side
on
though
they
say
the
snake
places
are
simply
ghastly
zombies
are
dead
people
whose
lifelines
lie
in
the
past
what
were
you
doing
in
saint
petersburg
before
the
ambush
i
asked
erich
that
is
if
you
can
talk
about
it
why
not
we
were
kidnapping
the
infant
einstein
back
from
the
snakes
in
yes
the
snakes
got
him
only
a
few
sleeps
back
endangering
the
west
whole
victory
over
russia
which
gave
your
dear
little
hitler
the
world
on
a
platter
for
fifty
years
and
got
me
loved
to
death
by
your
sterling
troops
in
the
liberation
of
chicago
but
which
leads
to
the
ultimate
victory
of
the
spiders
and
the
west
over
the
snakes
and
communism
remember
that
anyway
our
did
work
the
snakes
had
guards
posted
most
unusual
and
we
were
warned
the
whole
thing
was
a
great
mess
no
wonder
bruce
lost
his
head
not
that
it
excuses
him
the
new
boy
i
asked
sid
had
got
to
him
and
he
was
still
standing
with
hooded
eyes
where
erich
had
left
him
a
dark
pillar
of
shame
and
rage
a
lieutenant
from
world
war
one
an
englishman
i
gathered
that
i
told
erich
is
he
really
effeminate
he
smiled
i
had
to
call
him
something
when
he
said
i
was
a
coward
he
make
a
fine
soldier
only
needs
a
little
more
shaping
you
men
are
so
original
when
you
spat
i
lowered
my
voice
but
you
should
have
gone
on
and
called
him
a
snake
erich
mine
the
smile
got
crooked
who
knows
about
any
of
us
as
saint
petersburg
showed
me
the
snakes
spies
are
getting
cleverer
than
ours
the
blue
eyes
did
look
sweet
now
are
you
really
nothing
more
than
a
good
loyal
spider
erich
all
right
i
went
too
far
with
bruce
and
with
you
too
we
all
hacked
these
days
riding
with
one
leg
over
the
breaking
edge
maud
and
beau
were
supporting
the
roman
to
a
couch
maud
taking
most
of
his
weight
with
sid
still
supervising
and
the
new
boy
still
sulking
by
himself
the
new
girl
should
have
been
with
him
of
course
but
i
could
see
her
anywhere
and
i
decided
she
was
probably
having
a
nervous
breakdown
in
the
refresher
the
little
jerk
the
roman
looks
pretty
bad
erich
i
said
ah
mark
tough
got
virtue
as
his
people
say
and
our
little
starship
girl
will
bring
him
back
to
life
if
anybody
can
and
if
you
call
this
living
i
filled
in
dutifully
he
was
right
maud
had
years
of
psychomedical
experience
century
at
that
it
should
have
been
doc
job
but
that
was
fifty
drunks
back
maud
and
mark
that
will
be
an
interesting
experiment
erich
said
reminiscent
of
goering
with
the
frozen
men
and
the
naked
gypsy
girls
you
are
a
filthy
nazi
she
be
using
electrophoresis
and
deep
suggestion
if
i
know
anything
how
will
you
be
able
to
know
anything
if
she
switches
on
the
couch
curtains
as
i
perceive
she
is
preparing
to
do
filthy
nazi
i
said
and
meant
precisely
he
clicked
his
heels
and
bowed
a
millimeter
erich
friederich
von
hohenwald
in
the
army
of
the
third
reich
fell
at
narvik
where
he
was
recruited
by
the
spiders
lifeline
lengthened
by
a
big
change
after
his
first
death
and
at
latest
report
commandant
of
toronto
where
he
maintains
extensive
baby
farms
to
provide
him
with
breakfast
meat
if
you
believe
the
handbills
of
the
underground
at
your
service
oh
erich
it
all
so
lousy
i
said
touching
his
hand
reminded
that
he
was
one
of
the
unfortunates
resurrected
from
a
point
in
their
lifelines
well
before
their
deaths
in
his
case
because
the
date
of
his
death
had
been
shifted
forward
by
a
big
change
after
his
resurrection
and
as
every
demon
finds
out
if
he
ca
imagine
it
beforehand
it
is
pure
hell
to
remember
your
future
and
the
shorter
the
time
between
your
resurrection
and
your
death
back
in
the
cosmos
the
better
mine
bless
was
only
an
ten
minutes
on
north
clark
street
erich
put
his
other
hand
lightly
over
mine
fortunes
of
the
change
war
at
least
i
a
soldier
and
sometimes
assigned
to
future
operations
though
why
we
should
have
this
monomania
about
our
future
personalities
back
there
i
do
know
mine
is
a
stupid
thin
as
paper
and
frightfully
indignant
at
the
but
it
helps
me
a
little
if
i
see
him
in
perspective
and
at
least
i
get
back
to
the
cosmos
pretty
regularly
sei
so
i
better
off
than
you
entertainers
i
did
say
aloud
that
a
changing
cosmos
is
worse
than
none
but
i
found
myself
sending
a
prayer
to
the
bonny
dew
for
my
father
repose
that
the
change
winds
would
blow
lightly
across
the
lifeline
of
anton
forzane
professor
of
physiology
born
in
norway
and
buried
in
chicago
woodlawn
cemetery
is
a
nice
gray
spot
that
all
right
erich
i
said
we
entertainers
got
mittens
too
he
scowled
around
at
me
suspiciously
as
if
he
were
wondering
whether
i
had
all
my
buttons
on
mittens
he
said
what
do
you
mean
i
not
wearing
any
are
you
trying
to
say
something
about
bruce
gloves
which
incidentally
seem
to
annoy
him
for
some
reason
no
seriously
greta
why
do
you
entertainers
need
mittens
because
we
get
cold
feet
sometimes
at
least
i
do
got
mittens
as
i
say
a
sickly
light
dawned
in
his
prussian
puss
he
muttered
got
mittens
mit
god
with
us
and
roared
softly
greta
i
know
how
i
put
up
with
you
the
way
you
murder
a
great
language
for
cheap
laughs
you
got
to
take
me
as
i
am
i
told
him
mittens
and
all
thank
the
bonny
dew
and
hastily
explained
that
french
bon
the
good
god
do
hit
me
i
not
going
to
tell
you
any
more
of
my
secrets
he
laughed
feebly
like
he
was
dying
cheer
up
i
said
i
wo
be
here
forever
and
there
are
worse
places
than
the
place
he
nodded
grudgingly
looking
around
you
know
what
greta
if
promise
not
to
make
some
dreadful
joke
out
of
it
on
operations
i
pretend
i
soon
be
going
backstage
to
court
the
ballerina
greta
forzane
he
was
right
about
the
backstage
part
the
place
is
a
regular
with
the
void
for
an
audience
the
void
gray
hardly
disturbed
by
the
screens
masking
surgery
ugh
refresher
and
stores
between
the
last
two
are
the
bar
and
kitchen
and

between

and
the

where
the

usually
appears
are
the
shelves
and
taborets
of
the

the

center
spaced

distance
are
six
big
low
couches
one
with
its
curtains
now
shooting
up
into
the
gray
and
a
few
small
tables
it
is
like
a
ballet
set
and
the
crazy
costumes
and
characters
that
turn
up
do
ruin
the
illusion

no

diaghilev

night
in

hodgson
a
glove
beau
had
gone
behind
the
bar
and
was
talking
quietly
at
doc
but
with
his
eyes
elsewhere
looking
very
sallow
and
professional
in
his
white
and
i
thought
damballa
i
in
the
french
quarter
i
could
see
the
new
girl
sid
was
at
last
getting
to
the
new
boy
after
the
fuss
about
mark
he
threw
me
a
sign
and
i
started
over
with
erich
in
tow
welcome
sweet
lad
sidney
lessingham
your
host
and
a
fellow
englishman
born
in
king
lynn
schooled
at
cambridge
but
london
was
the
life
and
death
of
me
though
i
outlasted
bessie
jimmie
charlie
and
ollie
almost
and
what
a
life
by
turns
a
clerk
a
spy
a
bawd
the
two
trades
are
hand
in
glove
a
poet
of
no
account
a
beggar
and
a
peddler
of
resurrection
tracts
beau
lassiter
our
throats
are
tinder
at
the
word
poet
the
new
boy
looked
up
but
resentfully
as
if
he
had
been
tricked
into
it
and
to
spare
your
throat
for
drinking
sweet
gallant
i
be
so
bold
as
to
guess
and
answer
one
of
your
questions
sid
rattled
on
yes
i
knew
will
shakespeare
we
were
of
an
age
and
he
was
such
a
modest
rogue
that
we
all
wondered
whether
he
really
did
write
those
plays
your
pardon
but
that
scratch
might
be
looked
to
then
i
saw
that
the
new
girl
had
lost
her
head
but
gone
to
surgery
ugh
for
a
tray
she
reached
a
swab
toward
the
new
sticky
cheek
saying
rather
shrilly
if
i
might
her
timing
was
bad
sid
last
words
and
erich
approach
had
darkened
the
look
in
the
young
soldier
face
and
he
angrily
swept
her
arm
aside
without
even
glancing
at
her
erich
squeezed
my
arm
the
tray
clattered
to
the
floor
and
one
of
the
drinks
that
beau
was
bringing
almost
followed
it
ever
since
the
new
girl
arrival
beau
had
been
figuring
that
she
was
his
responsibility
though
i
do
think
the
two
of
them
had
reached
an
agreement
yet
beau
was
especially
set
on
it
because
i
was
thick
with
sid
at
the
time
and
maud
with
doc
she
loving
tough
cases
easy
now
lad
and
you
love
me
sid
thundered
again
shooting
beau
the
hold
it
look
she
just
a
poor
pagan
trying
to
comfort
you
swallow
your
bile
you
black
villain
and
perchance
it
will
turn
to
poetry
ah
did
i
touch
you
there
confess
you
are
a
poet
there
is
much
gets
by
sid
though
for
a
second
i
forgot
my
psychology
and
wondered
if
he
knew
what
he
was
doing
with
his
insights
yes
i
a
poet
all
right
the
new
boy
roared
i
bruce
marchant
you
bloody
zombies
i
a
poet
in
a
world
where
even
the
lines
of
the
king
james
and
your
precious
will
whom
you
use
for
laughs
are
safe
from
snakes
slime
and
the
spiders
dirty
legs
changing
our
history
stealing
our
certainties
claiming
to
be
so
blasted
and
best
intentioned
and
efficient
and
what
does
it
lead
to
this
bloody
si
glove
he
held
up
his
left
hand
which
still
held
the
mate
and
he
shook
it
what
wrong
with
the
spider
issue
gauntlet
heart
of
gold
sid
demanded
and
you
love
us
tell
us
while
erich
laughed
consider
yourself
lucky
mark
and
i
did
draw
any
gloves
at
all
what
wrong
with
it
bruce
yelled
the
bloody
things
are
both
lefts
he
slammed
it
down
on
the
floor
we
all
howled
we
could
help
it
he
turned
his
back
on
us
and
stamped
off
though
i
guessed
he
would
keep
out
of
the
void
erich
squeezed
my
arm
and
said
between
gasps
gott
what
have
i
always
told
you
about
soldiers
the
bigger
the
gripe
the
smaller
the
cause
it
is
infallible
one
of
us
did
laugh
ever
since
the
new
girl
heard
the
name
bruce
marchant
she
had
a
look
in
her
eyes
like
she
been
given
the
sacrament
i
was
glad
she
got
interested
in
something
because
been
pretty
much
of
a
snoot
and
a
wet
blanket
up
until
now
although
she
come
to
the
place
with
the
recommendation
of
having
been
a
real
whoopee
girl
in
london
and
new
york
in
the
twenties
she
looked
disapprovingly
at
us
as
she
gathered
up
the
tray
and
stuff
not
forgetting
the
glove
which
she
placed
on
the
center
of
the
tray
like
a
holy
relic
beau
cut
over
and
tried
to
talk
to
her
but
she
ghosted
past
him
and
once
again
he
could
do
anything
because
of
the
tray
in
his
hands
he
came
over
and
got
rid
of
the
drinks
quick
i
took
a
big
gulp
right
away
because
i
saw
the
new
girl
stepping
through
the
screen
into
surgery
and
i
hate
to
be
reminded
we
have
it
and
i
glad
doc
is
too
drunk
to
use
it
some
of
the
arachnoid
surgical
techniques
being
very
sickening
as
i
know
only
too
well
from
a
personal
experience
that
is
number
one
on
my
list
of
things
to
be
forgotten
by
that
time
bruce
had
come
back
to
us
saying
in
a
carefully
hard
voice
look
here
it
not
the
dashed
glove
itself
as
you
very
well
know
you
howling
demons
what
is
it
then
noble
heart
sid
asked
his
grizzled
gold
beard
heightening
the
effect
of
innocent
receptivity
it
the
principle
of
the
thing
bruce
said
looking
around
sharply
but
none
of
us
cracked
a
smile
it
this
mucking
inefficiency
and
death
of
the
cosmos
and
do
tell
me
that
is
in
the
cards
masquerading
as
benign
omniscient
authority
the
spiders
and
we
do
know
who
they
are
ultimately
it
just
a
name
we
see
only
agents
like
ourselves
the
spiders
pluck
us
from
the
quiet
graves
of
our
lifelines
is
that
bad
lad
sid
murmured
innocently
and
resurrect
us
if
they
can
and
then
tell
us
we
must
fight
another
power
called
the
snakes
just
a
name
too
which
is
bent
on
perverting
and
enslaving
the
whole
cosmos
past
present
and
future
and
is
it
lad
before
we
properly
awake
we
recruited
into
the
big
time
and
hustled
into
tunnels
and
burrows
outside
our
these
miserable
closets
gray
sacks
puss
pockets
no
offense
to
this
place
that
the
spiders
have
created
maybe
by
gigantic
implosions
but
no
one
knows
for
certain
and
then
we
sent
off
on
all
sorts
of
missions
into
the
past
and
future
to
change
history
in
ways
that
are
supposed
to
thwart
the
snakes
true
lad
and
from
then
on
the
pace
is
so
flaming
hot
and
heavy
the
shocks
come
so
fast
our
emotions
are
wrenched
in
so
many
directions
our
public
and
private
metaphysics
distorted
so
insanely
the
deepest
thread
of
reality
we
cling
to
tied
in
such
bloody
knots
that
we
never
can
get
things
straight
we
all
felt
that
way
lad
sid
said
soberly
beau
nodded
his
sleek
death
head
you
should
have
seen
me
my
first
fifty
sleeps
erich
put
in
while
i
added
us
girls
too
bruce
oh
i
know
i
get
hardened
to
it
and
do
think
i
ca
it
not
that
bruce
said
harshly
and
i
would
mind
the
personal
confusion
the
mess
it
made
of
my
spirit
i
would
even
mind
remaking
history
and
destroying
priceless
imperishable
beauties
of
the
past
if
i
felt
it
were
for
the
best
the
spiders
assure
us
that
to
thwart
the
snakes
it
is
that
the
west
ultimately
defeat
the
east
but
what
have
they
done
to
achieve
this
i
give
you
some
beautiful
examples
to
stabilize
power
in
the
early
mediterranean
world
they
have
built
up
crete
at
the
expense
of
greece
making
athens
a
ghost
city
plato
a
trivial
fabulist
and
putting
all
greek
culture
in
a
minor
key
you
got
time
for
culture
i
heard
myself
say
and
i
clapped
my
hand
over
my
mouth
in
gentle
reproof
but
remember
the
dialogues
lad
sid
observed
and
rail
not
at
crete
i
have
a
sweet
keftian
friend
for
how
long
will
i
remember
plato
dialogues
and
who
after
me
bruce
challenged
here
another
the
spiders
want
rome
powerful
and
to
date
they
helped
rome
so
much
that
she
collapses
in
a
blaze
of
german
and
parthian
invasions
a
few
years
after
the
death
of
julius
caesar
this
time
it
was
beau
who
butted
in
most
everybody
in
the
place
loves
these
bull
sessions
you
omit
to
mention
sir
that
rome
newest
downfall
is
directly
due
to
the
unholy
triple
alliance
the
snakes
have
fomented
between
the
eastern
classical
world
mohammedanized
christianity
and
marxist
communism
trying
to
pass
the
torch
of
power
futurewards
by
way
of
byzantium
and
the
eastern
church
without
ever
letting
it
pass
into
the
hands
of
the
spider
west
that
sir
is
the
snakes
plan
which
we
are
fighting
against
striving
to
revive
rome
glories
striving
is
the
word
for
it
bruce
snapped
here
yet
another
example
to
beat
russia
the
spiders
kept
england
and
america
out
of
world
war
two
thereby
ensuring
a
german
invasion
of
the
new
world
and
creating
a
nazi
empire
stretching
from
the
salt
mines
of
siberia
to
the
plantations
of
iowa
from
nizhni
novgorod
to
kansas
city
he
stopped
and
my
short
hairs
prickled
behind
me
someone
was
chanting
in
a
weird
spiritless
voice
like
footsteps
in
hard
snow
salz

kein

salz
i
turned
and
there
was
doc
waltzing
toward
us
with
little
tiny
steps
bent
over
so
low
that
the
ends
of
his
shawl
touched
the
floor
his
head
crooked
up
sideways
and
looking
through
us
i
knew
then
but
erich
translated
softly
salt
i
bring
salt
no
whip
merciful
sirs
he
is
speaking
to
my
countrymen
in
their
language
doc
had
spent
his
last
months
in
a
salt
mine
he
saw
us
and
got
up
straightening
his
top
hat
very
carefully
he
frowned
hard
while
my
heart
thumped
half
a
dozen
times
then
his
face
slackened
he
shrugged
his
shoulders
and
muttered
and
it
does
not
matter
sir
beau
translated
but
directing
his
remark
at
bruce
true
great
civilizations
have
been
dwarfed
or
broken
by
the
change
war
but
others
once
crushed
in
the
bud
have
bloomed
in
the
i
traveled
a
mississippi
that
had
never
known
grant
gunboats
i
studied
piano
languages
and
the
laws
of
chance
under
the
greatest
european
masters
at
the
university
of
vicksburg
and
you
think
your
pipsqueak
steamboat
culture
is
compensation
for
bruce
began
but
prithee
none
of
that
lad
sid
interrupted
smartly
nations
are
as
equal
as
so
many
madmen
or
drunkards
and
i
drink
dead
drunk
the
man
who
disputes
me
hear
reason
nations
are
not
so
puny
as
to
shrivel
and
vanish
at
the
first
tampering
with
their
past
no
nor
with
the
tenth
nations
are
monsters
boy
with
guts
of
iron
and
nerves
of
brass
waste
not
your
pity
on
them
true
indeed
sir
beau
pressed
cooler
and
keener
for
the
attack
on
his
greater
south
most
of
us
enter
the
change
world
with
the
false
metaphysic
that
the
slightest
change
in
the
past
a
grain
of
dust
misplaced
will
transform
the
whole
future
it
is
a
long
while
before
we
accept
with
our
minds
as
well
as
our
intellects
the
law
of
the
conservation
of
reality
that
when
the
past
is
changed
the
future
changes
barely
enough
to
adjust
barely
enough
to
admit
the
new
data
the
change
winds
meet
maximum
resistance
always
otherwise
the
first
operation
in
babylonia
would
have
wiped
out
new
orleans
sheffield
stuttgart
and
maud
davies
birthplace
on
ganymede
note
how
the
gap
left
by
rome
collapse
was
filled
by
the
imperialistic
and
christianized
germans
only
an
expert
demon
historian
can
tell
the
difference
in
most
ages
between
the
former
latin
and
the
present
gothic
catholic
church
as
you
yourself
sir
said
of
greece
it
is
as
if
an
old
melody
were
shifted
into
a
slightly
different
key
in
the
wake
of
a
big
change
cultures
and
individuals
are
transposed
true
yet
in
the
main
they
continue
much
as
they
were
except
for
the
usual
scattering
of
unfortunate
but
statistically
meaningless
accidents
all
right
you
bloody
savants
maybe
i
pushed
my
point
too
far
bruce
growled
but
if
you
want
variety
give
a
thought
to
the
rotten
methods
we
use
in
our
wonderful
change
war
poisoning
churchill
and
cleopatra
kidnapping
einstein
when
he
a
baby
the
snakes
did
it
first
i
reminded
him
yes
and
we
copied
them
how
resourceful
does
that
make
us
he
retorted
arguing
like
a
woman
if
we
need
einstein
why
do
we
resurrect
him
deal
with
him
as
a
man
beau
said
serving
his
culture
in
slightly
thicker
slices
but
when
you
have
enjoyed
your
status
as
doubleganger
a
longer
you
will
understand
that
great
men
can
rarely
be
resurrected
their
beings
are
too
crystallized
sir
their
lifelines
too
tough
pardon
me
but
i
think
that
rot
i
believe
that
most
great
men
refuse
to
make
the
bargain
with
the
snakes
or
with
us
spiders
either
they
scorn
resurrection
at
the
price
demanded
brother
they
ai
that
great
i
whispered
while
beau
glided
on
with
however
that
may
be
you
have
accepted
resurrection
sir
and
so
incurred
an
obligation
which
you
as
a
gentleman
must
honor
i
accepted
resurrection
all
right
bruce
said
a
glare
coming
into
his
eyes
when
they
pulled
me
out
of
my
line
at
passchendaele
in
ten
minutes
before
i
died
i
grabbed
at
the
offer
of
life
like
a
drunkard
grabs
at
a
drink
the
morning
after
but
even
then
i
thought
i
was
also
seizing
a
chance
to
undo
historic
wrongs
work
for
peace
his
voice
was
getting
wilder
all
the
time
just
beyond
our
circle
i
noticed
the
new
girl
watching
him
worshipfully
but
what
did
i
find
the
spiders
wanted
me
for
only
to
fight
more
wars
over
and
over
again
make
them
crueler
and
stinkinger
cut
the
swath
of
death
a
little
wider
with
each
big
change
work
our
way
a
little
closer
to
the
death
of
the
cosmos
sid
touched
my
wrist
and
as
bruce
raved
on
he
whispered
to
me
what
kind
of
ball
think
you
will
please
and
so
quench
this
rogue
and
you
love
me
discover
it
i
whispered
back
without
taking
my
eyes
off
bruce
either
i
know
somebody
who
be
happy
to
put
on
any
kind
of
ball
he
wants
if
just
notice
her
the
new
girl
sweetling
is
well
this
rogue
speaks
like
an
angry
angel
it
touches
my
heart
and
i
like
it
not
bruce
was
saying
hoarsely
but
loudly
and
so
we
sent
on
operations
in
the
past
and
from
each
of
those
operations
the
change
winds
blow
futurewards
swiftly
or
slowly
according
to
the
opposition
they
breast
sometimes
rippling
into
each
other
and
any
one
of
those
winds
may
shift
the
date
of
our
own
death
ahead
of
the
date
of
our
resurrection
so
that
in
an
instant
even
here
outside
the
cosmos
we
may
molder
and
rot
or
crumble
to
dust
and
vanish
away
the
wind
with
our
name
in
it
may
leak
through
the
door
faces
hardened
at
that
because
it
bad
form
to
mention
change
death
and
erich
flared
out
with
maul
kamerad
there
always
another
resurrection
but
bruce
did
keep
his
mouth
shut
he
said
is
there
i
know
the
spiders
promise
it
but
even
if
they
do
go
back
and
cut
another
doubleganger
from
my
lifeline
is
he
me
he
slapped
his
chest
with
his
bare
hand
i
do
think
so
and
even
if
he
is
me
with
unbroken
consciousness
why
he
been
resurrected
again
just
to
refight
more
wars
and
face
more
change
death
for
the
sake
of
an
almighty
power
his
voice
was
rising
to
a
climax
an
almighty
power
so
bloody
ineffectual
it
ca
furnish
one
poor
soldier
pulled
out
of
the
mud
of
passchendaele
one
miserable
change
commando
one
godforsaken
recuperee
a
proper
issue
of
equipment
and
he
held
out
his
bare
right
hand
toward
us
fingers
spread
a
little
as
if
it
were
the
most
amazing
object
and
most
deserving
of
outraged
sympathy
in
the
whole
world
the
new
girl
timing
was
perfect
she
whisked
through
us
and
before
he
could
so
much
as
wiggle
the
fingers
she
whipped
a
black
gauntleted
glove
on
it
and
anyone
could
see
that
it
fitted
his
hand
perfectly
this
time
our
laughing
beat
the
other
we
collapsed
and
slopped
our
drinks
and
pounded
each
other
on
the
back
and
then
started
all
over
der
handschuh
liebchen
where
she
get
it
erich
gasped
in
my
ear
probably
just
turned
the
other
one
inside
out
that
turns
a
left
into
a
right
i
done
it
myself
i
wheezed
collapsing
again
at
the
idea
that
would
put
the
lining
outside
he
objected
then
i
do
know
i
said
we
got
all
sorts
of
junk
in
stores
it
does
matter
he
assured
me
der
handschuh
all
through
it
bruce
just
stood
there
admiring
the
glove
moving
the
fingers
a
little
now
and
then
and
the
new
girl
stood
watching
him
as
if
he
were
eating
a
cake
she
baked
when
the
hysteria
quieted
down
he
looked
up
at
her
with
a
big
smile
what
did
you
say
your
name
was
lili
she
said
and
believe
you
me
she
was
lili
to
me
even
in
my
thoughts
from
then
on
for
the
way
she
handled
that
lunatic
lilian
foster
she
explained
i
english
also
marchant
read
young
man
i
do
know
how
many
times
you
have
it
wretched
stuff
from
the
dark
ages
i
mean
my
cambridge
days
in
the
trenches
i
was
working
up
some
poems
that
were
rather
better
i
wo
hear
you
say
that
but
i
be
terribly
thrilled
to
hear
the
new
ones
oh
marchant
it
was
so
strange
to
hear
you
call
it
passiondale
why
if
i
may
ask
because
that
the
way
i
pronounce
it
to
myself
but
i
looked
it
up
and
it
more
like
bless
you
all
the
tommies
called
it
passiondale
just
as
they
called
ypres
wipers
how
interesting
you
know
marchant
i
wager
we
were
recruited
in
the
same
operation
summer
of
i
got
to
france
as
a
red
cross
nurse
but
they
found
out
my
age
and
were
going
to
send
me
back
how
old
were
you
are
you
same
thing
i
mean
to
say
seventeen
seventeen
in
bruce
murmured
his
blue
eyes
glassy
it
was
real
corny
dialogue
and
i
could
resent
the
humorous
leer
erich
gave
me
as
we
listened
to
them
as
if
to
say
ai
it
nice
bruce
has
a
silly
little
english
schoolgirl
to
occupy
him
between
operations
just
the
same
as
i
watched
lili
in
her
dark
bangs
and
pearl
necklace
and
tight
little
gray
dress
that
reached
barely
to
her
knees
and
bruce
hulking
over
her
tenderly
in
his
snazzy
hussar
rig
i
knew
that
i
was
seeing
the
start
of
something
that
had
been
part
of
me
since
dave
died
fighting
franco
years
before
i
got
on
the
big
time
the
sort
of
thing
that
almost
made
me
wish
there
could
be
children
in
the
change
world
i
wondered
why
i
never
thought
of
trying
to
work
things
so
that
dave
got
resurrected
and
i
told
myself
no
it
all
changed
changed
better
the
change
winds
do
disturb
dave
or
i
know
about
it
no
i
did
die
in
i
was
merely
recruited
then
lili
was
telling
bruce
i
lived
all
through
the
twenties
as
you
can
see
from
the
way
i
dress
but
let
not
talk
about
that
shall
we
oh
marchant
do
you
think
you
can
possibly
remember
any
of
those
poems
you
started
in
the
trenches
i
ca
fancy
them
bettering
your
sonnet
that
concludes
with
bough
swings
in
the
wind
the
night
is
deep
look
at
the
stars
poor
little
ape
and
sleep
that
one
almost
made
me
whoop
what
monkeys
we
are
i
thought
though
i
be
the
first
to
admit
that
the
best
line
to
use
on
a
poet
is
one
of
his
own
in
fact
as
many
as
possible
i
decided
i
could
safely
forget
our
little
britons
and
devote
myself
to
erich
or
whatever
needed
me
chapter
hell
is
the
place
for
me
for
to
hell
go
the
fine
churchmen
and
the
fine
knights
killed
in
the
tourney
or
in
some
grand
war
the
brave
soldiers
and
the
gallant
gentlemen
with
them
will
i
go
there
go
also
the
fair
gracious
ladies
who
have
lovers
two
or
three
beside
their
lord
there
go
the
gold
and
the
silver
the
sables
and
ermine
there
go
the
harpers
and
the
minstrels
and
the
kings
of
the
earth
aucassin
nine
for
a
party
i
exchanged
my
drink
for
a
new
one
from
another
tray
beau
was
bringing
around
the
gray
of
the
void
was
beginning
to
look
real
pleasant
like
warm
thick
mist
with
millions
of
tiny
diamonds
floating
in
it
doc
was
sitting
grandly
at
the
bar
with
a
steaming
tumbler
of
tea
a
chaser
i
guess
since
he
was
just
putting
down
a
shot
glass
sid
was
talking
to
erich
and
laughing
at
the
same
time
and
i
said
to
myself
it
begins
to
feel
like
a
party
but
something
lacking
it
was
anything
to
do
with
the
major
maintainer
its
telltale
was
glowing
a
steady
red
like
a
nice
little
home
fire
amid
the
tight
cluster
of
dials
that
included
all
the
controls
except
the
lonely
and
frightening
introversion
switch
that
was
never
touched
then
couch
curtains
winked
out
and
there
were
she
and
the
roman
sitting
quietly
side
by
side
he
looked
down
at
his
shiny
boots
and
the
rest
of
his
black
duds
like
he
was
just
waking
up
and
could
believe
it
all
and
he
said
mutantur
nos
et
mutamur
in
and
i
raised
my
eyebrows
at
beau
who
was
taking
the
tray
back
and
he
did
proud
by
old
vicksburg
by
translating
all
things
change
and
we
change
with
them
then
mark
slowly
looked
around
at
us
and
i
can
testify
that
a
roman
smile
is
just
as
warm
as
any
other
nationality
and
he
finally
said
we
are
nine
the
proper
number
for
a
party
the
couches
too
it
is
good
maud
chuckled
proudly
and
erich
shouted
welcome
back
from
the
void
and
then
because
he
german
and
thinks
all
parties
have
to
be
noisy
and
satirically
pompous
he
jumped
on
a
couch
and
announced
und
permit
me
to
introduce
the
noblest
roman
of
them
all
marcus
vipsaius
niger
legate
to
nero
claudius
called
germanicus
in
a
former
time
stream
and
who
in
correct
mark
it
means
you
meatheads
died
bravely
fighting
the
parthians
and
the
snakes
in
the
battle
of
alexandria
hoch
hoch
we
all
swung
our
glasses
and
cheered
with
him
and
sid
yelled
at
erich
keep
your
feet
off
the
furniture
you
unschooled
rogue
and
grinned
and
boomed
at
all
three
hussars
take
your
ease
recuperees
and
maud
and
mark
got
their
drinks
the
roman
paining
beau
by
refusing
falernian
wine
in
favor
of
scotch
and
soda
and
right
away
everyone
was
talking
a
mile
a
minute
we
had
a
lot
to
catch
up
on
there
was
the
usual
yak
about
the
war
the
snakes
are
laying
mine
fields
in
the
void
i
do
believe
it
how
can
you
mine
nothing
and
the
shortages
bourbon
bobby
pins
and
the
stabilitin
that
would
have
brought
mark
out
of
it
faster
and
what
had
become
of
people
marcia
oh
she
not
around
any
more
she
been
caught
in
a
change
gale
and
green
and
stinking
in
five
seconds
but
i
was
going
to
say
that
and
mark
had
to
be
told
about
bruce
glove
which
convulsed
us
all
over
again
and
the
roman
remembered
a
legionary
who
had
carried
a
gripe
all
the
way
to
octavius
because
accidentally
been
issued
the
unbelievable
luxury
item
sugar
instead
of
the
usual
salt
and
erich
asked
sid
if
he
had
any
new
ghostgirls
in
stock
and
sid
sucked
his
beard
like
the
old
goat
he
is
dost
thou
ask
me
lusty
allemand
nay
there
are
several
great
beauties
amongst
them
an
austrian
countess
from
strauss
vienna
and
if
it
were
not
for
sweetling
here
mnnnn
i
poked
a
finger
in
erich
chest
between
two
of
the
bright
buttons
with
their
tiny
death
heads
you
my
little
von
hohenwald
are
a
menace
to
us
real
girls
you
have
too
much
of
a
thing
about
the
unawakened
ghost
kind
he
called
me
his
little
demon
and
hugged
me
a
bit
too
hard
to
prove
it
was
so
and
then
he
suggested
we
show
bruce
the
art
gallery
i
thought
this
was
a
real
brilliant
idea
but
when
i
tried
to
argue
him
out
of
it
he
got
stubborn
bruce
and
lili
were
willing
to
do
anything
anyone
wanted
them
to
though
not
so
willing
to
pay
any
attention
while
doing
it
the
saber
cut
was
just
a
thin
red
line
on
his
cheek
washed
away
all
the
dried
blood
the
gallery
gets
you
though
it
a
bunch
of
paintings
and
sculptures
and
especially
odd
all
made
by
soldiers
recuperating
here
and
a
lot
of
them
telling
about
the
change
war
from
the
stuff
made
of
brass
cartridges
flaked
flint
bits
of
ancient
pottery
glued
into
futuristic
shapes
incan
gold
rebeaten
by
a
martian
whorls
of
beady
lunan
wire
a
picture
in
tempera
on
a
thick
round
of
quartz
that
had
filled
a
starship
porthole
a
sumerian
inscription
chiseled
into
a
brick
from
an
atomic
oven
there
are
a
lot
of
things
in
the
gallery
and
i
can
always
find
some
i
have
ever
seen
before
it
gets
you
as
i
say
thinking
about
the
guys
that
made
them
and
their
thoughts
and
the
far
times
and
places
they
came
from
and
sometimes
when
i
feeling
low
i
come
and
look
at
them
so
i
feel
still
lower
and
get
inspired
to
kick
myself
back
into
a
good
temper
it
the
only
history
of
the
place
there
is
and
it
change
a
great
deal
because
the
things
in
it
and
the
feelings
that
went
into
them
resist
the
change
winds
better
than
anything
else
right
now
erich
witty
lecture
was
bouncing
off
the
big
ears
i
hide
under
my
pageboy
bob
and
i
was
thinking
how
awful
it
is
that
for
us
that
there
not
only
change
but
change
you
do
know
from
one
minute
to
the
next
whether
a
mood
or
idea
you
got
is
really
new
or
just
welling
up
into
you
because
the
past
has
been
altered
by
the
spiders
or
snakes
change
winds
can
blow
not
only
death
but
anything
short
of
it
down
to
the
featheriest
fancy
they
blow
thousands
of
times
faster
than
time
moves
but
no
one
can
say
how
much
faster
or
how
far
one
of
them
will
travel
or
what
damage
it
do
or
how
soon
it
damp
out
the
big
time
is
the
little
time
and
then
for
the
demons
there
the
fear
that
our
personality
will
just
fade
and
someone
else
climb
into
the
driver
seat
and
us
not
even
know
of
course
we
demons
are
supposed
to
be
able
to
remember
through
change
and
in
spite
of
it
that
why
we
are
demons
and
not
ghosts
like
the
other
doublegangers
or
merely
zombies
or
unborn
and
nothing
more
and
as
beau
truly
said
there
are
any
great
men
among
us
and
blamed
few
of
the
masses
either
we
a
rare
sort
of
people
and
that
why
the
spiders
have
to
recruit
us
where
they
find
us
without
caring
about
our
previous
knowledge
and
background
a
foreign
legion
of
time
a
strange
kind
of
folk
bright
but
always
in
the
background
with
nostalgia
and
cynicism
as
adaptable
as
centaurian
but
with
memories
as
long
as
a
lunan
six
arms
a
kind
of
change
people
you
might
say
the
cream
of
the
damned
but
sometimes
i
wonder
if
our
memories
are
as
good
as
we
think
they
are
and
if
the
whole
past
was
once
entirely
different
from
anything
we
remember
and
we
forgotten
that
we
forgot
as
i
say
the
gallery
gets
you
feeling
real
low
and
so
now
i
said
to
myself
back
to
your
lousy
little
commandant
kid
and
gave
myself
a
stiff
boot
erich
was
holding
up
a
green
bowl
with
gold
dolphins
or
spaceships
on
it
and
saying
and
to
my
mind
this
proves
that
etruscan
art
is
derived
from
egyptian
do
you
agree
bruce
bruce
looked
up
all
smiles
from
lili
and
said
what
was
that
dear
chap
erich
forehead
got
dark
as
the
door
and
i
was
glad
the
hussars
had
parked
their
sabers
along
with
their
shakos
but
before
he
could
even
get
out
a
jerry
cussword
doc
breezed
up
in
that
of
drunkenness
so
like
hypnotized
sobriety
moving
as
if
he
were
on
a
dolly
ghosted
the
bowl
out
of
erich
hand
said
a
beautiful
specimen
of
middle
systemic
venusian
when
eightaitch
finished
it
he
told
me
you
could
look
at
it
and
not
feel
the
waves
of
the
northern
venusian
shallows
rippling
around
your
hoofs
but
it
might
look
better
inverted
i
wonder
who
are
you
young
officer
and
he
carefully
put
the
bowl
back
on
its
shelf
and
rolled
on
it
a
fact
that
doc
knows
the
art
gallery
better
than
any
of
us
really
by
heart
he
being
the
oldest
inhabitant
though
he
maybe
picked
a
bad
time
to
show
off
his
knowledge
erich
was
going
to
take
out
after
him
but
i
said
nix
remember
gloves
and
sugar
and
he
contented
himself
with
complaining
that
it
so
gloomy
and
hopeless
i
tell
you
they
should
have
russians
working
for
the
spiders
not
even
as
entertainers
i
grinned
at
him
and
squeezed
his
hand
not
much
entertainment
in
doc
these
days
is
there
i
agreed
he
grinned
back
at
me
a
shade
sheepishly
and
his
face
smoothed
and
his
blue
eyes
looked
sweet
again
for
a
second
and
he
said
i
should
want
to
claw
out
at
people
that
way
greta
but
at
times
i
am
just
a
jealous
old
man
which
is
not
entirely
true
as
he
is
a
day
over
although
his
hair
is
nearly
white
our
lovers
had
drifted
on
a
few
steps
until
they
were
almost
fading
into
the
surgery
screen
it
was
the
last
spot
i
would
have
picked
for
the
formal
preliminaries
to
a
little
british
smooching
but
lili
probably
did
share
my
prejudices
though
i
remembered
she
told
me
served
a
brief
hitch
in
an
arachnoid
field
hospital
before
being
transferred
to
the
place
but
she
could
have
had
anything
like
the
experience
i
had
during
my
short
and
sour
career
as
a
spider
nurse
when
i
acquired
my
nightmare
and
flopped
completely
jobwise
but
on
the
floor
too
at
seeing
a
doctor
flick
a
switch
and
a
being
badly
injured
but
human
turn
into
a
long
cluster
of
glistening
strange
fruit
ugh
it
always
makes
me
want
to
toss
my
cookies
and
my
buttons
and
to
think
that
dear
old
daddy
anton
wanted
his
greta
chile
to
be
a
doctor
well
i
could
see
this
was
getting
me
anywhere
i
wanted
to
go
and
after
all
there
was
a
party
going
on
doc
was
babbling
something
at
a
great
rate
to
sid
i
just
hoped
doc
would
get
inspired
to
go
into
his
animal
imitations
which
sound
pretty
fierce
and
once
seriously
offended
some
recuperating
ets
maud
was
demonstrating
to
mark
a
century
and
beau
sat
down
at
the
piano
and
improvised
softly
on
her
rhythm
as
the
relaxing
notes
hit
us
erich
face
brightened
and
he
dragged
me
over
pleasantly
soon
i
had
my
feet
off
the
floor
which
we
do
carpet
because
most
of
the
ets
the
dear
boys
like
it
hard
and
i
was
shouldering
back
deep
into
the
couch
nearest
the
piano
with
cushions
all
around
me
and
a
fresh
drink
in
my
hand
while
my
nazi
boy
friend
was
getting
ready
to
discharge
his
as
song
which
did
alarm
me
too
much
as
his
baritone
is
passable
things
felt
real
good
like
the
maintainer
was
just
idling
to
keep
the
place
in
existence
and
moored
to
the
cosmos
not
exerting
itself
at
all
or
at
most
taking
an
occasional
lazy
paddle
stroke
at
times
the
loneliness
can
be
happy
and
comfortable
then
beau
raised
an
eyebrow
at
erich
who
nodded
and
next
thing
they
were
launched
into
a
song
we
all
know
though
i
never
found
out
where
it
originally
came
from
this
time
it
made
me
think
of
lili
and
i
wondered
why
and
why
it
a
tradition
at
recuperation
stations
to
call
the
new
girl
lili
though
in
this
case
it
happened
to
be
her
real
name
in
the
doorway
just
outside
of
space
winds
of
change
blow
you
but
do
touch
your
face
you
smile
as
you
whisper
tenderly

whirled
beyond
the
circuit
of
the
shuddering
bear
in
fractured
atoms
eliot
sos
from
nowhere
i
realized
the
piano
had
deserted
erich
and
i
cranked
my
head
up
and
saw
beau
maud
and
sid
streaking
for
the
control
divan
the
major
maintainer
was
blinking
and
fast
but
the
code
was
plain
enough
for
even
me
to
recognize
the
spider
distress
call
and
for
a
second
i
felt
just
sick
then
erich
blew
out
his
reserve
breath
in
the
middle
of
door
and
i
gave
myself
another
of
those
helpful
mental
boots
at
the
base
of
the
spine
and
we
hurried
after
them
toward
the
center
of
the
place
along
with
mark
the
blinks
faded
as
we
got
there
and
sid
told
us
not
to
move
because
we
were
making
shadows
he
glued
an
eye
to
the
telltale
and
we
held
still
as
statues
as
he
caressed
the
dials
like
he
was
making
love
one
sensitive
hand
flicked
out
past
the
introversion
switch
over
to
the
minor
maintainer
and
right
away
the
place
was
dark
as
your
soul
and
there
was
nothing
for
me
but
erich
arm
and
the
knowledge
that
sid
was
nursing
a
green
light
i
could
even
see
although
my
eyes
had
plenty
time
to
accommodate
then
the
green
light
finally
came
back
very
slowly
and
i
could
see
the
dear
reliable
old
face
the
beard
making
him
look
like
a
merman
and
then
the
telltale
flared
bright
and
sid
flicked
on
the
place
lights
and
i
leaned
back
that
nails
them
lads
whoever
and
whenever
they
may
be
get
ready
for
a
beau
who
was
closest
of
course
looked
at
him
sharply
sid
shrugged
uneasily
meseemed
at
first
it
was
from
our
own
globe
a
thousand
years
before
our
lord
but
that
indication
flickered
and
faded
like
witchfire
as
it
is
the
call
comes
from
something
smaller
than
the
place
and
certes
adrift
from
the
cosmos
meseemed
too
at
one
point
i
knew
the
fist
of
the
caller
an
antipodean
atomicist
named
but
that
likewise
changed
beau
said
we
not
in
the
right
phase
of
the
rhythm
for
a
are
we
sir
sid
answered
ordinarily
not
boy
beau
continued
i
did
think
we
had
any
scheduled
or
orders
sid
said
we
have
mark
eyes
glowed
he
tapped
erich
on
the
shoulder
an
octavian
denarius
against
ten
reichsmarks
it
is
a
snake
trap
erich
grin
showed
his
teeth
make
it
first
through
the
door
next
operation
and
i
on
it
did
take
that
to
tell
me
things
were
serious
or
the
thought
that
there
always
a
first
time
for
bumping
into
something
from
really
outside
the
cosmos
the
snakes
have
broken
our
code
more
than
once
maud
was
quietly
serving
out
weapons
and
doc
was
helping
her
only
bruce
and
lili
stood
off
but
they
were
watching
the
telltale
brightened
sid
reached
toward
the
maintainer
saying
all
right
my
hearties
remember
through
this
doorway
pass
the
fishiest
finaglers
in
and
out
of
the
cosmos
the
door
appeared
to
the
left
and
above
where
it
should
be
and
darkened
much
too
fast
there
was
a
gust
of
stale
salt
seawind
if
that
makes
sense
but
no
change
winds
i
could
tell
and
i
had
been
bracing
myself
against
them
the
door
got
inky
and
there
was
a
flicker
of
gray
fur
whips
and
a
flash
of
copper
flesh
and
gilt
and
something
dark
and
a
clump
of
hoofs
and
erich
was
sighting
a
stun
gun
across
his
left
forearm
and
then
the
door
had
vanished
like
that
and
a
tentacled
silvery
lunan
and
a
venusian
satyr
were
coming
straight
toward
us
the
lunan
was
hugging
a
pile
of
clothes
and
weapons
the
satyr
was
helping
a
woman
carry
a
bronze
chest
the
woman
was
wearing
a
short
skirt
and
bolero
jacket
of
leather
so
dark
brown
it
was
almost
black
she
had
a
hairdress
and
she
was
boldly
gilded
here
and
there
and
wore
sandals
and
copper
anklets
and
wristlets
one
of
them
a
caller
and
from
her
wide
copper
belt
hung
a
ax
she
was
and
her
forehead
and
chin
receded
but
the
effect
was
anything
but
weak
she
had
a
face
like
a
beautiful
arrowhead
and
a
familiar
one
by
golly
but
before
i
could
say
kabysia
labrys
maud
shrilly
beat
me
to
it
with
it
kaby
with
two
friends
break
out
a
couple
of
ghostgirls
and
then
i
saw
it
really
was
week
because
i
recognized
my
lunan
boy
friend
ilhilihis
and
in
the
midst
of
all
the
confusion
i
got
a
nice
kick
out
of
knowing
i
was
getting
so
i
could
tell
the
personality
of
one
muzzle
from
another
they
reached
the
control
divan
and
illy
dumped
his
load
and
the
others
let
down
the
chest
and
kaby
staggered
but
shook
off
the
two
ets
when
they
started
to
support
her
and
she
looked
daggers
at
sid
when
he
tried
to
do
the
same
although
she
his
sweet
keftian
friend
he
mentioned
to
bruce
she
leaned
on
the
divan
and
took
two
gasping
breaths
so
deep
that
the
ridges
of
her
spine
showed
through
her
waist
and
then
she
threw
up
her
head
and
commanded
wine
while
beau
was
rushing
it
sid
tried
to
take
her
hand
again
saying
sweetling
i
never
heard
you
call
before
and
knew
not
this
pretty
little
fist
but
she
ripped
out
save
your
comfort
for
the
lunan
and
i
looked
and
saw
hey
zeus
that
one
of
ilhilihis
six
tentacles
was
lopped
off
halfway
that
was
for
me
and
going
to
him
i
fast
briefed
myself
remember
he
only
weighs
fifty
pounds
for
all
he
seven
feet
high
he
does
like
low
sounds
or
to
be
grabbed
the
two
legs
are
tentacles
and
do
act
the
same
uses
them
for
long
walks
tentacles
for
leaps
uses
tentacles
for
close
vision
too
and
for
manipulation
of
course
extended
they
mean
he
at
ease
retracted
on
guard
or
nervous
sharply
retracted
disgusted
greeting
just
then
one
of
them
swept
across
my
face
like
a
feather
duster
and
i
said
illy
man
it
been
a
lot
of
sleeps
and
brushed
my
fingers
across
his
muzzle
it
still
took
a
little
not
to
hug
him
and
i
did
reach
a
little
cluckingly
for
his
lopped
tentacle
but
he
wafted
it
away
from
me
and
the
little
belted
to
his
side
squeaked
naughty
naughty
papa
will
fix
his
little
old
self
greta
girl
ever
bandaged
even
a
terra
octopus
i
had
an
intelligent
one
from
around
a
quarter
billion
but
i
did
tell
him
so
i
stood
and
let
him
talk
to
the
palm
of
my
hand
with
one
of
his
tentacles
i
do
savvy
but
it
feels
good
though
i
often
wondered
who
taught
him
english
and
watched
him
use
a
couple
others
to
whisk
a
sort
of
lunan
out
of
his
pouch
and
cap
his
wound
with
it
meanwhile
the
satyr
knelt
over
the
bronze
chest
which
was
decorated
with
little
death
heads
and
crosses
with
hoops
at
the
top
and
swastikas
but
looking
much
older
than
nazi
and
the
satyr
said
to
sid
quick
thinkin
gov
when
ya
saw
the
door
comin
in
high
n
soffened
up
gravty
unner
it
but
cud
i
hav
sum
hep
now
sid
touched
the
minor
maintainer
and
we
all
got
very
light
and
my
stomach
did
a
while
the
satyr
piled
on
the
chest
the
clothes
and
weapons
that
illy
had
been
carrying
and
pranced
off
with
it
all
and
carefully
put
it
down
at
the
end
of
the
bar
i
decided
the
english
instructor
must
have
been
quite
a
character
too
wish
i
met
him
her
it
sid
thought
to
ask
illy
if
he
wanted
gravity
in
one
sector
but
my
boy
likes
to
mix
and
being
such
a
lightweight
gravity
does
bother
him
as
he
said
to
me
once
would
jovian
gravity
bother
a
beetle
greta
girl
i
asked
illy
about
the
satyr
and
he
squeaked
that
his
name
was
sevensee
and
that
he
never
met
him
before
this
operation
i
knew
the
satyrs
were
from
a
billion
years
in
the
future
just
as
the
loonies
were
from
a
billion
in
the
past
and
i
thought
kreesed
us
but
it
must
have
been
a
real
big
or
operation
to
have
the
spiders
using
those
two
for
it
with
two
billion
years
between
them
a
that
gives
you
a
feeling
of
awe
for
a
second
you
know
illustration
i
started
to
ask
illy
about
it
but
just
then
beau
came
scampering
back
from
the
bar
with
a
big
earthenware
goblet
of
wine
we
try
to
keep
a
variety
of
drinking
tools
in
stock
so
folks
will
feel
more
at
home
kaby
grabbed
it
from
him
and
drained
most
of
it
in
one
swallow
and
then
smashed
it
on
the
floor
she
does
things
like
that
though
tried
to
teach
her
better
then
she
stared
at
what
she
was
thinking
about
until
the
whites
showed
all
around
her
eyes
and
her
lips
pulled
way
back
from
her
teeth
and
she
looked
a
lot
less
human
than
the
two
ets
just
like
a
fury
only
a
time
traveler
knows
how
like
the
wild
murals
and
engravings
of
them
some
of
the
ancients
can
look
my
hair
stood
up
at
the
screech
she
let
out
she
smashed
a
fist
into
the
divan
and
cried
goddess
must
i
see
crete
destroyed
revived
and
now
destroyed
again
it
is
too
much
for
your
servant
personally
i
thought
she
could
stand
anything
there
was
a
rush
of
questions
at
what
she
said
about
crete
i
asked
one
of
them
for
the
news
certainly
frightened
me
but
she
shot
up
her
arm
straight
for
silence
and
took
a
deep
breath
and
began
in
the
balance
hung
the
battle
rowing
like
black
centipedes
the
dorian
hulls
bore
down
on
our
outnumbered
ships
on
the
bright
beach
masked
by
rocks
sevensee
and
i
stood
by
the
needle
gun
ready
to
give
the
black
hulls
silent
wounds
beside
us
was
ilhilihis
suited
as
a
sea
monster
but
then
then
then
i
saw
she
was
altogether
the
iron
babe
for
her
voice
broke
and
she
started
to
shake
and
to
sob
rackingly
although
her
face
was
still
a
mask
of
rage
and
she
threw
up
the
wine
sid
stepped
in
and
made
her
stop
which
i
think
he
been
wanting
to
do
all
along
chapter
whenever
i
take
up
a
newspaper
and
read
it
i
fancy
i
see
ghosts
creeping
between
the
lines
there
must
be
ghosts
all
over
the
world
they
must
be
as
countless
as
the
grains
of
the
sands
it
seems
to
me
ibsen
sid
insists
on
ghostgirls
my
elizabethan
boy
friend
put
his
fists
on
his
hips
and
laid
down
the
law
to
us
as
if
we
were
a
lot
of
nervous
children
who
been
playing
too
hard
look
you
masters
this
is
a
recuperation
station
and
i
am
running
it
as
such
a
plague
of
all
operations
i
care
not
if
the
frame
of
things
disjoints
and
the
whole
change
world
goes
to
ruin
but
you
warrior
maid
are
going
to
rest
and
drink
more
wine
slowly
before
you
tell
your
tale
and
your
colleagues
are
going
to
be
properly
companioned
no
questions
anyone
beau
and
you
love
us
give
us
a
lively
tune
kaby
relaxed
a
little
and
let
him
put
his
hand
carefully
against
her
back
in
token
of
support
and
she
said
grudgingly
all
right
fat
belly
then
so
help
me
to
the
tune
of
the
muskrat
ramble
which
i
taught
beau
we
got
girls
for
those
two
ets
and
everybody
properly
paired
up
right
here
i
want
to
point
out
that
a
lot
of
the
things
they
say
in
the
change
world
about
recuperation
stations
simply
are
so
and
anyway
they
always
leave
out
of
it
the
soldiers
that
come
through
the
door
are
looking
for
a
good
time
sure
but
they
hurt
real
bad
too
every
one
of
them
deep
down
in
their
minds
and
hearts
if
not
always
in
their
bodies
or
so
you
can
see
it
right
away
believe
me
a
temporal
operation
is
no
joke
and
to
start
with
there
is
one
person
in
a
hundred
who
can
endure
to
be
cut
from
his
lifeline
and
become
a
really
doubleganger
a
demon
that
is
let
alone
a
soldier
what
does
a
badly
hurt
and
creature
need
who
been
fighting
hard
to
look
out
for
him
and
feel
for
him
and
patch
him
up
and
it
helps
if
the
one
is
of
the
opposite
sex
something
that
goes
beyond
species
there
your
basis
for
the
place
and
the
wild
way
it
goes
about
its
work
and
also
for
most
other
recuperation
stations
or
entertainment
spots
the
name
entertainer
can
be
misleading
but
i
like
it
she
got
to
be
a
lot
more
than
a
good
party
girl
or
boy
though
she
got
to
be
that
too
she
got
to
be
a
nurse
and
a
psychologist
and
an
actress
and
a
mother
and
a
practical
ethnologist
and
a
lot
of
things
with
longer
names
and
a
reliable
friend
none
of
us
are
all
those
things
perfectly
or
even
near
it
we
just
try
but
when
the
call
comes
entertainers
have
to
forget
grudges
and
gripes
and
envies
and
jealousies
and
remember
they
lively
people
with
sharp
emotions
because
there
is
any
time
then
for
anything
but
and
do
ask
and
deep
inside
her
a
good
entertainer
does
care
who
take
the
way
it
shaped
up
this
time
it
was
pretty
clear
to
me
i
ought
to
shift
to
illy
although
i
was
quite
easy
in
my
mind
about
leaving
erich
because
the
lunan
was
a
long
time
from
home
and
after
all
erich
was
among
anthropoids
ilhilihis
needed
someone
who
was
i
like
illy
and
not
just
because
he
is
a
sort
of
tall
cross
between
a
spider
monkey
and
a
persian
cat
though
that
is
a
handsome
combo
when
you
come
to
think
of
it
i
like
him
for
himself
so
when
he
came
in
all
lopped
and
shaky
after
a
mean
operation
i
was
the
right
person
to
look
out
for
him
now
i
made
my
little
speech
and
in
the
change
world
can
go
on
making
their
bum
jokes
but
i
ask
you
how
could
an
arrangement
between
illy
and
me
be
anything
but
platonic
we
might
have
had
some
octopoid
girls
and
nymphs
in
stock
sid
be
sure
until
he
checked
but
ilhilihis
and
sevensee
voted
for
real
people
and
i
knew
sid
saw
it
their
way
maud
squeezed
mark
hand
and
tripped
over
to
sevensee
those
are
sharp
hoofs
you
got
man
picked
up
some
of
my
language
like
she
has
everything
else
though
beau
did
frown
over
his
shoulder
at
lili
from
the
piano
maybe
to
argue
that
she
ought
to
take
on
the
et
as
mark
had
been
a
real
casualty
and
could
use
live
nursing
but
it
was
plain
as
day
to
anybody
but
beau
that
bruce
and
lili
were
a
big
thing
and
the
last
to
be
disturbed
erich
acted
stiffly
hurt
at
losing
me
but
i
knew
he
was
he
thinks
he
has
a
great
technique
with
ghostgirls
and
he
likes
to
show
it
off
and
he
really
is
pretty
slick
at
it
if
you
go
for
that
sort
of
thing
and
yang
my
yin
who
does
at
times
and
when
sid
formally
wafted
the
countess
out
of
stores
a
real
blonde
stunner
in
a
white
satin
hobble
skirt
with
a
white
egret
swaying
up
from
her
tiny
hat
way
ahead
of
maud
and
lili
and
me
when
it
came
to
looks
though
transparent
as
cigarette
smoke
and
when
erich
clicked
his
heels
and
bowed
over
her
hand
and
proudly
conducted
her
to
a
couch
black
svengali
to
her
trilby
and
started
to
some
life
into
her
with
much
head
cocking
and
toothy
smiling
and
a
flow
of
witty
flattery
and
when
she
began
to
flirt
back
and
the
dream
look
in
her
eyes
sharpened
hungrily
and
focused
on
him
well
then
i
knew
that
erich
was
happy
and
felt
he
was
doing
proud
by
the
no
my
little
commandant
was
worrying
me
on
that
score
mark
had
drawn
a
greek
hetaera
name
of
phryne
i
suppose
not
the
one
who
maybe
still
does
the
famous
courtroom
striptease
back
in
athens
and
he
was
waking
her
up
with
little
sips
of
his
scotch
and
soda
though
from
some
looks
he
flashed
i
got
the
idea
kaby
was
the
kid
he
really
went
for
sid
was
coaxing
the
fighting
gal
to
take
some
bread
and
olives
along
with
the
wine
and
for
a
wonder
doc
seemed
to
be
carrying
on
an
animated
and
rational
conversation
with
sevensee
and
maud
maybe
comparing
notes
on
the
northern
venusian
shallows
and
beau
had
got
on
to
panther
rag
and
bruce
and
lili
were
leaning
on
the
piano
smiling
very
appreciatively
but
talking
to
each
other
a
mile
a
minute
illy
turned
back
from
inspecting
them
all
and
squeaked
animals
with
clothes
are
so
refreshing
dahling
like
you
all
carrying
banners
maybe
he
had
something
there
though
my
banners
were
kind
of
ash
wednesday
a
charcoal
gray
sweater
and
skirt
he
looked
at
my
mouth
with
a
tentacle
to
see
how
i
was
smiling
and
he
squeaked
softly
do
i
seem
dull
and
commonplace
to
you
greta
girl
because
i
have
got
banners
just
another
zombie
from
a
billion
years
in
your
past
as
gray
and
lifeless
as
luna
is
today
not
as
when
she
was
a
real
dreamy
sister
planet
simply
bursting
with
air
and
water
and
feather
forests
or
am
i
as
strangely
interesting
to
you
as
you
are
to
me
girl
from
a
billion
years
in
my
future
illy
you
sweet
i
told
him
giving
him
a
little
pat
i
noticed
his
fur
was
still
vibrating
nervously
and
i
decided
the
heck
with
orders
i
going
to
pump
him
about
what
he
was
doing
with
kaby
and
the
satyr
could
have
him
a
billion
years
from
home
and
bottled
up
too
besides
i
was
curious
chapter
maiden
nymph
and
mother
are
the
eternal
royal
trinity
of
the
island
and
the
goddess
who
is
worshipped
there
in
each
of
these
aspects
as
new
moon
full
moon
and
old
moon
is
the
sovereign
deity
graves
crete
circa
kaby
pushed
back
at
sid
some
seconds
of
bread
and
olives
and
when
he
raised
his
bushy
eyebrows
gave
him
a
curt
nod
that
meant
she
knew
what
she
was
doing
she
stood
up
and
sort
of
took
a
position
all
the
talk
quieted
down
fast
even
bruce
and
lili
kaby
face
and
voice
were
strained
now
but
they
were
relaxed
either
woe
to
spider
woe
to
cretan
heavy
is
the
news
i
bring
you
bear
it
bravely
like
strong
women
when
we
got
the
gun
unlimbered
i
heard
seaweed
fry
and
crackle
we
three
leaped
behind
the
rock
wall
saw
our
gun
grow
white
as
sunlight
in
a
of
the
serpents
natch
we
feared
we
were
outnumbered
and
i
called
upon
my
caller
illustration
i
do
know
how
she
does
it
but
she
does
in
english
too
that
is
when
she
figures
she
got
something
important
to
report
and
maybe
she
needs
a
little
time
to
get
ready
beau
claims
that
all
the
ancients
fit
their
thoughts
into
measured
lines
as
naturally
as
we
pick
a
word
that
will
do
but
i
not
sure
how
good
the
vicksburg
language
department
is
though
why
i
should
wonder
about
things
like
that
when
i
got
kaby
spouting
the
stuff
right
in
front
of
me
i
do
know
but
i
did
die
there
kiddos
i
still
hoped
to
hurt
the
greek
ships
maybe
with
the
snake
own
heat
gun
so
i
quick
tried
to
outflank
them
my
two
comrades
crawled
beside
me
they
are
males
but
they
have
courage
soon
we
spied
the
they
were
snakes
and
they
were
many
filthily
disguised
as
cretans
there
was
an
indignant
murmur
at
this
for
our
cutthroat
change
war
has
its
code
the
soldiers
tell
me
being
an
entertainer
i
do
have
to
say
what
i
think
they
had
seen
us
when
we
saw
them
kaby
swept
on
and
they
loosed
a
killing
volley
and
struck
about
us
in
a
storm
of
wind
and
fire
and
the
lunan
lost
a
feeler
fighting
for
crete
triple
goddess
so
we
dodged
behind
a
sand
hill
steered
our
flight
back
toward
the
water
it
was
awful
what
we
saw
there
crete
brave
ships
all
sunk
or
sinking
blue
sky
sullied
by
their
once
again
the
greeks
had
licked
us
aided
by
the
filthy
serpents
round
our
wrecks
their
black
ships
scurried
like
black
beetles
filth
their
diet
yet
this
day
they
dine
on
heroes
on
the
quiet
sunlit
beach
there
i
could
feel
a
change
gale
blowing
working
changes
deep
inside
me
aches
and
pains
that
were
a
stranger
half
my
memories
were
doubled
half
my
lifeline
crooked
and
twisted
three
new
moles
upon
my
goddess
goddess
triple
goddess
her
voice
wavered
and
sid
reached
out
a
hand
but
she
straightened
her
back
triple
goddess
give
me
courage
to
tell
everything
that
happened
we
ran
down
into
the
water
hoping
to
escape
by
diving
we
had
hardly
gotten
under
when
the
hit
above
us
turning
all
the
cool
green
surface
to
a
roaring
white
inferno
but
as
i
believe
i
told
you
i
was
calling
on
my
caller
and
a
door
now
opened
to
us
deep
below
the
deadly
we
dived
in
like
frightened
minnows
and
a
lot
of
water
with
us
off
chicago
gold
coast
dave
once
gave
me
a
lesson
in
and
remembering
it
i
got
a
flash
of
kaby
door
in
the
dark
depths
for
a
moment
all
was
chaos
then
the
door
slammed
shut
behind
us
been
picked
up
in
time
nick
by
an
express
room
of
our
spiders
sloshing
two
feet
deep
in
water
much
more
cramped
for
space
than
this
place
it
was
manned
by
a
magician
an
old
coot
named
he
dispelled
the
water
quickly
and
reported
on
his
caller
we
got
dry
were
feeling
human
illy
here
had
shed
his
swimsuit
when
we
looked
at
the
maintainer
it
was
glowing
changing
melting
and
when
touched
it
he
fell
backward
death
was
in
him
then
the
void
began
to
darken
narrow
shrink
and
close
around
us
so
i
called
upon
my
caller
without
wasting
time
let
me
tell
you
we
ca
say
for
sure
what
was
it
slowly
squeezed
that
sweet
express
room
but
we
fear
the
dirty
snakes
have
found
a
way
to
find
our
places
and
attack
outside
the
cosmos
found
the
spiderweb
that
links
us
in
the
void
gray
no
murmur
this
time
this
reaction
was
genuine
we
been
hit
where
we
lived
and
i
could
see
everybody
was
scared
as
sick
as
i
was
except
maybe
bruce
and
lili
who
were
still
holding
hands
and
beaming
gently
i
decided
they
were
the
kind
that
love
makes
brave
which
it
does
do
to
me
it
just
gives
me
two
people
to
worry
about
i
can
see
you
dig
our
feelings
kaby
continued
this
thing
scared
the
pants
off
of
us
if
we
could
have
we
have
even
introverted
the
maintainer
broken
all
the
ties
that
bind
us
chanced
it
incommunicado
but
the
little
old
maintainer
was
a
seething
puddle
filled
with
bubbles
big
as
handballs
we
sat
tight
and
watched
the
void
close
i
kept
calling
on
my
caller
i
squeezed
my
eyes
shut
but
that
made
it
easier
to
see
the
three
of
them
with
the
void
shutting
down
on
them
was
ours
still
behaving
yes
bibi
miriam
poetry
or
no
poetry
it
got
me
lying
dying
also
thought
the
snakes
had
done
it
and
he
knew
that
death
was
in
him
so
he
whispered
me
his
mission
giving
me
precise
instructions
how
to
press
the
seven
death
hands
starting
lockside
counterclockwise
one
three
five
six
two
four
seven
then
you
have
a
half
an
hour
after
you
have
pressed
the
seven
do
not
monkey
with
the
buttons
get
out
fast
and
do
stop
moving
i
was
getting
this
part
and
i
could
see
that
anyone
else
was
though
bruce
was
whispering
to
lili
i
remembered
seeing
skulls
engraved
on
the
bronze
chest
i
looked
at
illy
and
he
nodded
a
tentacle
and
spread
two
to
say
i
guessed
that
yes
had
said
something
like
that
but
no
illy
did
know
much
about
it
all
these
things
and
more
he
whispered
kaby
went
on
with
the
last
gasps
of
his
telling
all
his
secret
orders
for
he
not
been
sent
to
get
us
he
was
on
a
separate
mission
when
he
heard
my
soss
sid
it
you
he
was
to
contact
as
the
first
leg
of
his
mission
pick
up
from
you
three
black
hussars
demons
daring
soldiers
then
to
wait
until
the
places
next
match
rhythm
with
the
cosmos
matter
of
two
mealtimes
barely
and
to
tune
in
northern
egypt
in
the
age
of
the
last
caesar
in
the
year
of
rome
swift
downfall
there
to
start
an
operation
in
a
battle
near
a

to

now
i
savvy
how
you
guided
my
least
footstep
when
i
thought
you
gone
and
left
me
for
i
flubbed
your
signal
we
found
sid
place
that
the
first
leg
and
i
see
the
three
black
hussars
and
we
brought
with
us
the
weapon
and
the
parthian
disguises
salvaged
from
the
doomed
express
room
when
your
door
appeared
in
time
nick
and
the
room
around
us
closing
spewed
us
through
before
it
vanished
with
the
corpse
of
triple
goddess
draw
the
milk
now
from
the
womanhood
i
flaunt
here
and
inject
the
blackest
hatred

goddess
we
can
swing

the
roar
that
made
me
try
to
stop
my
ears
with
my
shoulders
did
come
from
kaby
she
spoken
her
piece
but
from
sid
the
dear
boy
was
purple
enough
to
make
me
want
to
remind
him
you
can
die
of
high
blood
pressure
just
as
easy
in
the
change
world
dump
me
with
ops
i
not
endure
it
is
this
a
battle
post
they
be
mounting
operations
from
field
hospitals
next
kabysia
labrys
thou
art
mad
to
suggest
it
and
what
this
prattle
of
locks
clocks
and
death
heads
buttons
and
monkeys
this
brabble
this
farrago
this
and
where
the
weapon
you
prate
of
in
that
whoreson
bronze
casket
i
suppose
she
nodded
looking
blank
and
almost
a
little
shy
as
poetic
possession
faded
from
her
her
answer
came
like
its
faltering
last
echo
it
is
nothing
but
a
tiny
tactical
atomic
bomb
chapter
after
about
millisecond
one
part
of
a
second
has
elapsed
the
radius
of
the
ball
of
fire
is
some
feet
and
the
temperature
is
then
in
the
vicinity
of
degrees
centigrade
at
this
instant
the
luminosity
as
observed
at
a
distance
of
yards
miles
is
approximately
times
that
of
the
sun
as
seen
at
the
earth
surface
the
ball
of
fire
expands
very
rapidly
to
its
maximum
radius
of
feet
within
less
than
a
second
from
the
explosion
los
alamos
time
to
think
brother
that
was
all
we
needed
to
make
everybody
but
kaby
and
the
two
ets
start
yelping
at
once
me
included
it
may
seem
strange
that
change
people
able
to
whiz
through
time
and
space
and
roust
around
outside
the
cosmos
and
knowing
at
least
by
hearsay
of
weapons
a
billion
years
in
the
future
like
the
mindbomb
should
panic
at
being
shut
in
with
a
little
primitive
century
gadget
well
they
feel
the
same
as
atomic
scientists
would
feel
if
a
bengal
tiger
were
brought
into
their
laboratory
neither
more
nor
less
scared
i
a
moron
at
physics
but
i
do
know
the
fireball
is
bigger
than
the
place
remember
that
besides
the
bomb
we
recently
been
presented
with
a
lot
of
other
fears
we
had
had
time
to
cope
with
especially
the
business
of
the
snakes
having
learned
how
to
get
at
our
places
and
melt
the
maintainers
and
collapse
them
not
to
mention
the
general
impression
first
saint
petersburg
then
crete
that
the
whole
change
war
was
going
against
the
spiders
yet
in
a
free
corner
of
my
mind
i
was
shocked
at
how
badly
we
were
all
panicking
it
made
me
admit
what
i
did
like
to
that
we
were
all
in
pretty
much
the
same
state
as
doc
except
that
the
bottle
did
happen
to
be
our
out
and
had
the
rest
of
us
been
controlling
our
drinking
so
well
lately
maud
yelled
jettison
it
and
pulled
away
from
the
satyr
and
ran
from
the
bronze
chest
beau
harking
back
to
what
they
thought
of
doing
in
the
express
room
when
it
was
too
late
hissed
sirs
we
must
introvert
and
vaulted
over
the
piano
bench
and
legged
it
for
the
control
divan
erich
seconded
him
with
a
in
himmel
ja
from
beside
the
surly
forgotten
countess
holding
by
its
slim
stem
an
empty
wine
glass
i
felt
my
mind
flinch
because
introverting
a
place
is
several
degrees
worse
than
foxholing
it
supposed
not
only
to
keep
the
door
tight
shut
but
also
to
lock
it
so
even
the
change
winds
ca
get
through
cut
the
place
loose
from
the
cosmos
altogether
i
never
talked
with
anyone
from
a
place
that
had
been
introverted
mark
dumped
phryne
off
his
lap
and
ran
after
maud
the
greek
ghostgirl
quite
solid
now
looked
around
with
sleepy
fear
and
fumbled
her
chiton
together
at
the
throat
she
wrenched
my
attention
away
from
everyone
else
for
a
moment
and
i
could
help
wondering
whether
the
person
or
zombie
back
in
the
cosmos
from
whose
lifeline
the
ghost
has
been
taken
does
at
least
have
strange
dreams
or
thoughts
when
something
like
this
happens
sid
stopped
beau
though
he
almost
got
bowled
over
doing
it
and
he
held
the
gambler
away
from
the
maintainer
in
a
bear
hug
and
bellowed
over
his
shoulders
masters
are
you
mad
have
you
lost
your
wits
maud
mark
marcus
magdalene
on
your
lives
unhand
that
casket
maud
had
swept
the
clothes
and
bows
and
quivers
and
stuff
off
it
and
was
dragging
it
out
from
the
bar
toward
the
door
sector
so
as
to
dump
it
through
fast
when
we
got
one
i
guess
while
mark
acted
as
if
he
were
trying
to
help
her
and
wrestle
it
away
from
her
at
the
same
time
they
kept
on
as
if
they
had
heard
a
word
sid
said
with
mark
yelling
let
go
this
holds
rome
answer
to
parthia
on
the
nile
kaby
watched
them
as
if
she
wanted
to
help
mark
but
scorned
to
scuffle
with
a
mere
well
mark
had
said
it
in
latin
i
guess
call
girl
then
on
the
top
of
the
bronze
chest
i
saw
those
seven
lousy
skulls
starting
at
the
lock
as
plain
as
if
they
been
under
a
magnifying
glass
though
ordinarily
they
have
been
a
vague
circle
to
my
eyes
at
the
distance
and
i
lost
my
mind
and
started
to
run
in
the
opposite
direction
but
illy
whipped
three
tentacles
around
me
and
squeaked
easy
now
greta
girl
do
you
be
doing
it
too
hold
still
or
papa
spank
my
my
but
you
can
whirl
about
when
you
have
a
mind
to
my
stampede
had
carried
his
featherweight
body
a
couple
of
yards
but
it
stopped
me
and
i
got
my
mind
back
partly
unhand
it
i
say
sid
repeated
without
accomplishing
anything
and
he
released
beau
though
he
kept
a
hand
near
the
gambler
shoulder
then
my
fat
friend
from
lynn
regis
looked
real
distraught
at
the
void
and
blustered
at
no
one
in
particular
think
you
i
mutiny
against
my
masters
desert
the
spiders
go
to
ground
like
a
spent
fox
and
pull
my
hole
in
after
me
a
plague
of
such
cowardice
who
suggests
it
introversion
no
mere
device
unless
ordered
supervised
and
sanctioned
it
means
the
end
and
what
if
i
introverted
ere
we
got
kaby
call
for
succor
hey
his
warrior
maid
nodded
with
harsh
approval
and
he
noticed
it
and
shook
his
free
hand
at
her
and
scolded
her
not
that
i
say
yea
to
your
mad
plan
for
that
devil
casket
you
lackwit
and
yet
to
jettison
oh
ye
gods
ye
gods
he
wiped
his
hand
across
his
face
grant
me
a
minute
in
which
i
may
think
thinking
time
was
an
item
even
on
the
strictly
limited
list
at
the
moment
although
sevensee
squatting
dourly
on
his
hairy
haunches
where
maud
had
left
him
threw
in
a
thas
tellin
em
gov
then
doc
at
the
bar
stood
up
tall
as
abe
lincoln
in
his
top
hat
and
shawl
and
century
duds
and
raised
an
unwavering
arm
for
silence
and
said
something
that
sounded
like
introversh
inversh
glovsh
and
then
his
enunciation
switched
to
better
than
perfect
as
he
continued
i
know
to
an
absolute
certainty
what
we
must
do
it
showed
me
how
rabbity
we
were
that
the
place
got
quiet
as
a
church
while
we
all
stopped
whatever
we
were
doing
and
waited
breathless
for
a
poor
drunk
to
tell
us
how
to
save
ourselves
he
said
something
like
inversh
bosh
and
held
our
eyes
for
a
moment
longer
then
the
light
went
out
of
his
and
he
slobbered
out
a
and
slid
an
arm
far
along
the
bar
for
a
bottle
and
started
to
pour
it
down
his
throat
without
stopping
sliding
before
he
completed
his
collapse
to
the
floor
in
the
split
second
while
our
attention
was
still
focused
on
the
bar
bruce
vaulted
up
on
top
of
it
so
fast
it
was
almost
like
he
popped
up
from
nowhere
though
seen
him
start
from
behind
the
piano
i
a
question
has
anyone
here
triggered
that
bomb
he
said
in
a
voice
that
was
very
clear
and
just
loud
enough
so
it
ca
go
off
he
went
on
after
just
the
right
pause
his
easy
grin
and
brisk
manner
putting
more
heart
into
me
all
the
time
what
more
if
it
were
to
be
triggered
we
still
have
half
an
hour
i
believe
you
said
it
had
that
long
a
fuse
he
stabbed
a
finger
at
kaby
she
nodded
right
he
said
it
have
to
be
that
long
for
whoever
plants
it
in
the
parthian
camp
to
get
away
there
another
safety
margin
second
question
is
there
a
locksmith
in
the
house
for
all
bruce
easiness
he
was
watching
us
like
a
golden
eagle
and
he
caught
beau
and
maud
affirmatives
before
they
had
a
chance
to
explain
or
hedge
them
and
said
that
very
good
under
certain
circumstances
you
two
be
the
ones
to
go
to
work
on
the
chest
but
before
we
consider
that
there
question
three
is
anyone
here
an
atomics
technician
that
one
took
a
little
conversation
to
straighten
out
illy
having
to
explain
that
yes
the
early
lunans
had
atomic
power
had
they
blasted
the
life
off
their
planet
with
it
and
made
all
those
ghastly
craters
but
no
he
was
a
technician
exactly
he
was
a
thinger
i
thought
at
first
his
squeakbox
was
lisping
what
was
a
thinger
well
a
thinger
was
someone
who
manipulated
things
in
a
way
that
was
truly
impossible
to
describe
but
no
you
could
possibly
thing
atomics
the
idea
was
quite
ridiculous
so
he
could
be
an
atomics
thinger
the
term
was
worse
than
a
contradiction
well
really
while
sevensee
from
his
advantage
of
the
lunan
grunted
to
the
effect
that
his
culture
did
rightly
use
any
kind
of
power
but
just
sort
of
moved
satyrs
and
stuff
by
wrastling
around
or
think
em
roun
ef
we
hafta
ca
think
em
in
the
void
tho
wus
luck
hafta
have
i
dunno
wut
dun
havvit
anyhow
so
we
do
have
an
bruce
summed
up
which
makes
it
worse
than
useless
downright
dangerous
to
tamper
with
the
chest
we
know
what
to
do
if
we
did
get
inside
safely
one
more
question
he
directed
it
toward
sid
how
long
before
we
can
jettison
anything
sid
looking
a
shade
jealous
yet
mostly
grateful
for
the
way
bruce
had
calmed
his
chickens
started
to
explain
but
bruce
did
seem
to
be
taking
any
chance
of
losing
his
audience
and
as
soon
as
sid
got
to
the
word
rhythm
he
pulled
the
answer
away
from
him
in
brief
not
until
we
can
effectively
tune
in
on
the
cosmos
again
thank
you
master
lessingham
that
at
least
five
hours
two
mealtimes
as
the
cretan
officer
put
it
and
he
threw
kaby
a
quick
soldierly
smile
so
whether
the
bomb
goes
to
egypt
or
elsewhere
there
not
a
thing
we
can
do
about
it
for
five
hours
all
right
then
his
smile
blinked
out
like
a
light
and
he
took
a
couple
of
steps
up
and
down
the
bar
as
if
measuring
the
space
he
had
two
or
three
cocktail
glasses
sailed
off
and
popped
but
he
did
seem
to
notice
them
and
we
hardly
did
either
it
was
creepy
the
way
he
kept
staring
from
one
to
another
of
us
we
had
to
look
up
behind
his
face
with
the
straight
golden
hair
flirting
around
it
was
only
the
void
all
right
then
he
repeated
suddenly
we
twelve
spiders
and
two
ghosts
and
we
time
for
a
bit
of
a
talk
and
we
all
in
the
same
bloody
boat
fighting
the
same
bloody
war
so
we
all
know
what
talking
about
i
raised
the
subject
a
while
back
but
i
was
steamed
up
about
a
glove
and
it
was
a
big
jest
all
right
but
now
the
gloves
are
off
bruce
ripped
them
out
of
his
belt
where
they
been
tucked
and
slammed
them
down
on
the
bar
to
be
kicked
off
the
next
time
he
paced
back
and
forth
and
it
was
funny
because
he
went
right
on
i
been
getting
a
completely
new
picture
of
what
this
spiders
war
has
been
doing
to
each
one
of
us
oh
jolly
good
sport
to
slam
around
in
space
and
time
and
then
have
a
rugged
little
party
outside
both
of
them
when
the
operation
over
it
sweet
to
know
there
no
cranny
of
reality
so
narrow
no
privacy
so
intimate
or
sacred
no
wall
of
was
or
will
be
strong
enough
that
we
shoulder
in
knowledge
is
a
glamorous
thing
sweeter
than
lust
or
gluttony
or
the
passion
of
fighting
and
including
all
three
the
ultimate
insatiable
hunger
and
it
great
to
be
faust
even
in
a
pack
of
other
fausts
it
sweet
to
jigger
reality
to
twist
the
whole
course
of
a
man
life
or
a
culture
to
ink
out
his
or
its
past
and
scribble
in
a
new
one
and
be
the
only
one
to
know
and
gloat
over
the
changes
hah
killing
men
or
carrying
off
women
is
in
it
for
glutting
the
sense
of
power
sweet
to
feel
the
change
winds
blowing
through
you
and
know
the
pasts
that
were
and
the
past
that
is
and
the
pasts
that
may
be
it
sweet
to
wield
the
atropos
and
cut
a
zombie
or
unborn
out
of
his
lifeline
and
look
the
doubleganger
in
the
face
and
see
the
in
it
and
recruit
a
brother
welcome
a
newborn
fellow
demon
into
our
ranks
and
decide
whether
he
best
fit
as
soldier
entertainer
or
what
or
he
ca
stand
resurrection
it
fries
or
freezes
him
and
you
got
to
decide
whether
to
return
him
to
his
lifeline
and
his
zombie
dreams
only
they
be
a
little
grayer
and
horrider
than
they
were
before
or
whether
if
she
got
that
tantalizing
something
to
bring
her
shell
along
for
a
ghostgirl
that
sweet
too
it
even
sweet
to
have
change
death
poised
over
your
neck
to
know
that
the
past
is
the
precious
indestructible
thing
you
been
taught
it
was
to
know
that
there
no
certainty
about
the
future
either
whether
there
even
be
one
to
know
that
no
part
of
reality
is
holy
that
the
cosmos
itself
may
wink
out
like
a
flicked
switch
and
god
be
not
and
nothing
left
but
nothing
he
threw
out
his
arms
against
the
void
and
knowing
all
that
doubly
sweet
to
come
through
the
door
into
the
place
and
be
out
of
the
worst
of
the
change
winds
and
enjoy
a
recuperation
and
share
the
memories
of
all
these
sweetnesses
i
been
talking
about
and
work
out
all
the
fascinating
feelings
you
been
accumulating
back
in
the
cosmos
layer
by
black
layer
in
the
company
of
and
with
the
help
of
the
best
bloody
little
band
of
fellow
fausts
and
faustines
going
oh
it
a
sweet
life
all
right
but
i
asking
you
and
here
his
eyes
stabbed
us
again
one
by
one
fast
i
asking
you
what
it
done
to
us
i
been
getting
a
completely
new
picture
as
i
said
of
what
my
life
was
and
what
it
could
have
been
if
there
been
changes
of
the
sort
that
even
we
demons
ca
make
and
what
my
life
is
i
been
watching
how
we
all
been
responding
to
things
just
now
to
the
news
of
saint
petersburg
and
to
what
the
cretan
officer
told
beautifully
only
it
was
beautiful
what
she
had
to
tell
and
mostly
to
that
bloody
box
of
bomb
and
i
simply
asking
each
one
of
you
what
happened
to
you
he
stopped
his
pacing
and
stuck
his
thumbs
in
his
belt
and
seemed
to
be
listening
to
the
wheels
turning
in
at
least
eleven
other
heads
only
i
stopped
mine
pretty
quick
with
dave
and
father
and
the
rape
of
chicago
coming
up
out
of
the
dark
on
the
turn
and
mother
and
the
indiana
dunes
and
jazz
limited
just
behind
them
followed
by
the
unthinkable
thing
the
spider
doctor
had
flicked
into
existence
when
i
flopped
as
a
nurse
because
i
ca
stand
that
to
be
done
to
my
mind
by
anybody
but
myself
i
stopped
them
by
using
the
old
infallible
entertainers
gimmick
a
fast
survey
of
the
most
interesting
topic
there
is
other
people
troubles
offhand
beau
looked
as
if
he
had
most
troubles
shamed
by
his
boss
and
his
girl
given
her
heart
to
a
soldier
he
was
hugging
them
to
himself
very
quiet
i
did
stop
for
the
two
ets
they
too
hard
to
figure
or
for
doc
nobody
can
tell
whether
a
drunk
at
the
black
or
bright
end
of
his
cycle
you
just
know
it
cycling
maud
ought
to
be
suffering
as
much
as
beau
called
names
and
caught
out
in
a
panic
which
always
hurts
her
because
she
plus
three
hundred
years
more
future
than
the
rest
of
us
and
figures
she
ought
to
be
that
much
wiser
which
she
is
always
not
to
mention
she
over
fifty
years
old
though
her
cosmetic
science
keeps
her
looking
and
acting
teenage
most
of
the
time
she
backed
away
from
the
bronze
chest
so
as
not
to
stand
out
and
now
lili
came
from
behind
the
piano
and
stood
beside
her
lili
had
the
opposite
of
troubles
a
great
big
glow
for
bruce
proud
as
a
promised
princess
watching
her
betrothed
erich
frowned
when
he
saw
her
for
he
seemed
proud
too
proud
of
the
way
his
had
taken
command
of
us
panicky
whacks
sid
still
looked
mostly
grateful
and
inclined
to
let
bruce
keep
on
talking
even
kaby
and
mark
those
two
dragons
hot
for
battle
standing
a
little
in
front
and
to
one
side
of
us
by
the
bronze
chest
like
its
guardians
seemed
willing
to
listen
they
made
me
realize
one
reason
sid
had
for
letting
bruce
run
on
although
the
path
his
talk
was
leading
us
down
was
flashing
with
danger
signals
when
it
was
over
there
still
be
the
problem
of
what
to
do
with
the
bomb
and
a
real
opposition
shaping
up
between
soldiers
and
entertainers
and
sid
was
hoping
a
solution
would
turn
up
in
the
meantime
or
at
least
was
willing
to
put
off
the
evil
day
but
beyond
all
that
and
like
the
rest
of
us
i
could
tell
from
the
way
sid
was
squinting
his
browy
eyes
and
chewing
his
beardy
lip
that
he
was
shaken
and
moved
by
what
bruce
had
said
this
new
boy
had
dipped
into
our
hearts
and
counted
our
kicks
so
beautifully
better
than
most
of
us
could
have
done
and
then
somehow
turned
them
around
so
that
we
had
to
think
of
what
messes
and
heels
and
black
sheep
and
lost
lambs
we
were
well
we
wanted
to
keep
on
listening
chapter
give
me
a
place
to
stand
and
i
will
move
the
world
archimedes
a
place
to
stand
bruce
voice
had
a
faraway
touch
and
he
was
looking
up
left
at
the
void
as
he
said
have
you
ever
really
wondered
why
the
two
sides
of
this
war
are
called
the
snakes
and
the
spiders
snakes
may
be
clear
enough
you
always
call
the
enemy
something
dirty
but
spiders
our
name
for
ourselves
bear
with
me
ilhilihis
i
know
that
no
being
is
created
dirty
or
malignant
by
nature
but
this
is
a
matter
of
anthropoid
feelings
and
folkways
yes
mark
i
know
that
some
of
your
legions
have
nicknames
like
the
drunken
lions
and
the
snails
and
that
about
as
insulting
as
calling
the
british
expeditionary
force
the
old
contemptibles
no
you
have
to
go
to
bands
of
vicious
youths
in
cities
slated
for
ruin
to
find
a
habit
of
naming
like
ours
and
even
they
would
try
to
brighten
up
the
black
a
bit
but
simply
spiders
and
snakes
for
their
name
for
themselves
too
you
know
spiders
and
snakes
what
are
our
masters
that
we
give
them
names
like
that
it
gave
me
the
shivers
and
set
my
mind
working
in
a
dozen
directions
and
i
could
stop
it
although
it
made
the
shivers
worse
illy
beside
me
now
i
never
given
it
a
thought
before
but
he
did
have
eight
legs
of
a
sort
and
i
remembered
thinking
of
him
as
a
spider
monkey
and
had
the
lunans
had
wisdom
and
atomic
power
and
a
billion
years
in
which
to
get
the
change
war
rolling
or
suppose
in
the
far
future
terra
own
spiders
evolved
intelligence
and
a
cruel
cannibal
culture
they
be
able
to
keep
their
existence
secret
i
had
no
idea
of
who
or
what
would
be
on
earth
in
day
and
would
it
be
perfect
black
hairy
poisoned
to
spin
webs
secretly
through
the
world
of
thought
and
all
of
space
and
time
and
beau
was
there
something
real
snaky
about
him
the
way
he
moved
and
all
spiders
and
snakes
und
as
erich
called
them
s
but
ss
stood
for
the
nazi
the
black
shirts
and
what
if
some
of
those
cruel
crazy
jerries
had
discovered
time
travel
and
i
brought
myself
up
with
a
jerk
and
asked
myself
greta
how
nuts
can
you
get
from
where
he
was
on
the
floor
the
front
of
the
bar
his
sounding
board
doc
shrieked
up
at
bruce
like
one
of
the
damned
from
the
pit
speak
against
the
spiders
do
blaspheme
they
can
hear
the
unborn
whisper
others
whip
only
the
skin
but
they
whip
the
naked
brain
and
heart
and
erich
called
out
that
enough
bruce
but
bruce
did
spare
him
a
look
and
said
but
whatever
the
spiders
are
and
no
matter
how
much
whip
they
use
it
plain
as
the
telltale
on
the
maintainer
that
the
change
war
is
not
only
going
against
them
but
getting
away
from
them
dwell
for
a
bit
on
the
current
flurry
of
stupid
slugging
and
panicky
anachronism
when
we
all
know
that
anachronism
is
what
gets
the
change
winds
out
of
control
this
pounding
on
the
fracas
as
if
it
were
the
only
battle
going
and
the
only
way
to
work
things
whisking
constantine
from
britain
to
the
bosporus
by
rocket
sending
a
pocket
submarine
back
to
sail
with
the
armada
against
drake
woodensides
i
wager
you
had
heard
those
and
now
to
save
rome
an
atomic
bomb
ye
gods
they
could
have
used
greek
fire
or
even
dynamite
but
a
fission
weapon
i
leave
you
to
imagine
what
gaps
and
scars
that
will
make
in
what
left
of
history
the
smothering
of
greece
and
the
vanishment
of
provence
and
the
troubadours
and
the
papacy
irish
captivity
wo
be
in
it
the
cut
on
his
cheek
had
opened
again
and
was
oozing
a
little
but
he
did
pay
any
attention
to
it
and
neither
did
we
as
his
lips
thinned
in
irony
and
he
said
but
i
forgetting
that
this
is
a
cosmic
war
and
that
the
spiders
are
conducting
operations
on
billions
trillions
of
planets
and
inhabited
gas
clouds
through
millions
of
ages
and
that
just
one
little
world
one
little
solar
system
sevensee
and
we
can
hardly
expect
our
inscrutable
masters
with
all
their
pressing
preoccupations
and
responsibilities
to
be
especially
understanding
or
tender
in
their
treatment
of
our
pet
books
and
centuries
our
favorite
prophets
and
periods
or
unduly
concerned
about
preserving
any
of
the
trifles
that
we
just
happen
to
hold
dear
perhaps
there
are
some
sentimentalists
who
would
rather
die
forever
than
go
on
living
in
a
world
without
the
the
field
equations
and
matthew
keats
and
the
but
our
masters
are
practical
creatures
ministering
to
the
needs
of
those
rugged
souls
who
want
to
go
on
living
no
matter
what
erich
bruce
i
telling
you
that
enough
was
lost
in
the
quickening
flow
of
the
new
boy
words
i
wo
spend
much
time
on
the
minor
signs
of
our
major
the
canceling
of
leaves
the
sharper
shortages
the
loss
of
the
express
room
the
use
of
recuperation
stations
for
ops
and
all
the
other
frantic
patchwork
last
operation
but
one
we
were
saddled
with
three
soldiers
from
outside
the
galaxy
and
no
fault
of
theirs
they
were
no
earthly
use
such
little
things
might
happen
at
a
bad
spot
in
any
war
and
are
perhaps
only
local
but
there
a
big
thing
he
paused
again
to
let
us
wonder
i
guess
maud
must
have
worked
her
way
over
to
me
for
i
felt
her
dry
little
hand
on
my
arm
and
she
whispered
out
of
the
side
of
her
mouth
what
do
we
do
now
we
listen
i
told
her
the
same
way
i
felt
a
little
impatient
with
her
need
to
be
doing
something
about
things
she
cocked
a
eyebrow
at
me
and
murmured
you
too
i
did
get
to
ask
her
me
too
what
crush
on
bruce
nuts
because
just
then
bruce
voice
took
up
again
in
the
faraway
range
have
you
ever
asked
yourselves
how
many
operations
the
fabric
of
history
can
stand
before
it
all
stitches
whether
too
much
change
wo
one
day
wear
out
the
past
and
the
present
and
the
future
too
the
whole
bleeding
business
is
the
law
of
the
conservation
of
reality
any
more
than
a
thin
hope
given
a
long
name
a
prayer
of
theoreticians
change
death
is
as
certain
as
heat
death
and
far
faster
every
operation
leaves
reality
a
bit
cruder
a
bit
uglier
a
bit
more
makeshift
and
a
whole
lot
less
rich
in
those
details
and
feelings
that
are
our
heritage
like
the
crude
penciled
sketch
on
canvas
when
stripped
off
the
paint
if
that
goes
on
wo
the
cosmos
collapse
into
an
outline
of
itself
then
nothing
how
much
thinning
can
reality
stand
having
more
and
more
doublegangers
cut
out
of
it
and
there
another
thing
about
every
operation
it
wakes
up
the
zombies
a
little
more
and
as
its
change
winds
die
it
leaves
them
a
little
more
disturbed
and
and
frazzled
those
of
you
who
have
been
on
operations
in
heavily
temporal
areas
will
know
what
i
mean
that
look
they
give
you
out
of
the
sides
of
their
eyes
as
if
to
say
again
for
christ
sake
go
away
we
the
dead
we
the
ones
who
do
want
to
wake
up
who
do
want
to
be
demons
and
hate
to
be
ghosts
stop
torturing
us
i
looked
around
at
the
ghostgirls
i
could
help
it
they
somehow
got
together
on
the
control
divan
facing
us
their
backs
to
the
maintainers
the
countess
had
dragged
along
the
bottle
of
wine
erich
had
fetched
her
earlier
and
they
were
passing
it
back
and
forth
the
countess
had
a
big
rose
splotch
across
the
ruffled
white
lace
of
her
blouse
bruce
said
there
come
a
day
when
all
the
zombies
and
all
the
unborn
wake
up
and
go
crazy
together
and
figuratively
come
marching
at
us
in
their
numberless
hordes
saying
had
enough
but
i
did
turn
back
to
bruce
right
away
phryne
chiton
had
slipped
off
one
shoulder
and
she
and
the
countess
were
sitting
sagged
forward
elbows
on
knees
legs
spread
at
least
as
far
as
the
countess
hobble
skirt
would
let
her
and
swayed
toward
each
other
a
little
they
were
still
surprisingly
solid
although
they
had
had
any
personal
attention
for
a
half
hour
and
they
were
looking
up
over
my
head
with
eyes
and
they
seemed
so
help
me
to
be
listening
to
what
bruce
was
saying
and
maybe
hearing
some
of
it
we
make
a
careful
distinction
between
zombies
and
unborn
between
those
troubled
by
our
operations
whose
lifelines
lie
in
the
past
and
those
whose
lifelines
lie
in
the
future
but
is
there
any
distinction
any
longer
can
we
tell
the
difference
between
the
past
and
the
future
can
we
any
longer
locate
the
now
the
real
now
of
the
cosmos
the
places
have
their
own
nows
the
now
of
the
big
time
we
on
but
different
and
it
not
made
for
real
living
the
spiders
tell
us
that
the
real
now
is
somewhere
in
the
last
half
of
the
century
which
means
that
several
of
us
here
are
also
alive
in
the
cosmos
have
lifelines
along
which
the
now
is
traveling
but
do
you
swallow
that
story
quite
so
easily
ilhilihis
sevensee
how
does
it
strike
the
servants
of
the
triple
goddess
the
spiders
of
octavian
rome
the
demons
of
good
queen
bess
the
gentlemen
zombies
of
the
greater
south
do
the
unborn
man
the
starships
maud
the
spiders
also
tell
us
that
although
the
fog
of
battle
makes
the
now
hard
to
pin
down
precisely
it
will
return
with
the
unconditional
surrender
of
the
snakes
and
the
establishment
of
cosmic
peace
and
roll
on
as
majestically
toward
the
future
as
before
quickening
the
continuum
with
its
passage
do
you
really
believe
that
or
do
you
believe
as
i
do
that
we
used
up
all
the
future
as
well
as
the
past
wasted
it
in
premature
experience
and
that
we
had
the
real
now
smudged
out
of
existence
stolen
from
us
forever
the
precious
now
of
true
growth
the
in
which
all
life
lies
the
moment
like
a
newborn
baby
that
is
the
only
home
for
hope
there
is
he
let
that
start
to
sink
in
then
took
a
couple
of
quick
steps
and
went
on
his
voice
rising
over
erich
bruce
for
the
last
time
and
seeming
to
pick
up
a
note
of
hope
from
the
very
word
he
had
used
but
although
things
look
terrifyingly
black
there
remains
a
chance
the
slimmest
chance
but
still
a
chance
of
saving
the
cosmos
from
change
death
and
restoring
reality
richness
and
giving
the
ghosts
good
sleep
and
perhaps
even
regaining
the
real
now
we
have
the
means
right
at
hand
what
if
the
power
of
time
traveling
were
used
not
for
war
and
destruction
but
for
healing
for
the
mutual
enrichment
of
the
ages
for
quiet
communication
and
growth
in
brief
to
bring
a
peace
message
but
my
little
commandant
is
quite
an
actor
himself
and
knows
a
wee
bit
about
the
principles
of
and
he
was
not
going
to
let
bruce
drown
him
out
as
if
he
were
just
another
extra
playing
a
voice
from
the
mob
he
darted
across
our
front
between
us
and
the
bar
took
a
running
leap
and
landed
bang
on
the
bloody
box
of
bomb
a
bit
later
maud
was
silently
showing
me
the
white
ring
above
her
elbow
where
i
grabbed
her
and
illy
was
teasing
a
clutch
of
his
tentacles
out
of
my
other
hand
and
squeaking
reproachfully
greta
girl
do
ever
do
that
erich
was
standing
on
the
chest
and
i
noticed
that
his
boots
carefully
straddled
the
circle
of
skulls
and
i
should
have
known
anyway
you
could
hardly
push
them
in
the
right
order
by
jumping
on
them
and
he
was
pointing
at
bruce
and
saying
and
that
means
mutiny
my
young
sir
gottes
bruce
listen
to
me
and
step
down
before
you
say
anything
worse
i
older
than
you
bruce
mark
older
trust
in
your
guide
yourself
by
their
knowledge
he
had
got
my
attention
but
i
had
much
rather
have
him
black
my
eye
you
older
than
me
bruce
was
grinning
when
your
advantage
was
spent
in
soaking
up
the
wisdom
of
a
race
of
sadistic
dreamers
gone
paranoid
in
a
world
whose
had
already
been
muddied
by
one
total
war
mark
older
than
me
when
all
his
ideas
and
loyalties
are
those
of
a
wolf
pack
of
unimaginative
sluggers
two
thousand
years
younger
than
i
am
either
of
you
older
because
you
have
more
of
the
killing
cynicism
that
is
all
the
wisdom
the
change
world
ever
gives
you
do
make
me
laugh
i
an
englishman
and
i
come
from
an
epoch
when
total
war
was
still
a
desecration
and
the
flowers
and
buds
of
thoughts
not
yet
whacked
off
or
blighted
i
a
poet
and
poets
are
wiser
than
anyone
because
they
the
only
people
who
have
the
guts
to
think
and
feel
at
the
same
time
right
sid
when
i
talk
to
all
of
you
about
a
peace
message
i
want
you
to
think
about
it
concretely
in
terms
of
using
the
places
to
bring
help
across
the
mountains
of
time
when
help
is
really
needed
not
to
bring
help
that
undeserved
or
knowledge
that
premature
or
contaminating
sometimes
not
to
bring
anything
at
all
but
just
to
check
with
infinite
tenderness
and
concern
that
everything
safe
and
the
glories
of
the
universe
unfolding
as
they
were
intended
to
yes
you
are
a
poet
bruce
erich
broke
in
you
can
tootle
soulfully
on
the
flute
and
make
us
drip
tears
you
can
let
out
the
stops
on
the
big
organ
pipes
and
make
us
tremble
as
if
at
jehovah
footsteps
for
the
last
twenty
minutes
you
have
been
giving
us
some
very
poetry
but
what
are
you
an
entertainer
or
are
you
a
soldier
right
then
i
do
know
what
it
was
maybe
sid
clearing
his
throat
i
could
sense
our
feelings
beginning
to
turn
against
bruce
i
got
the
strangest
feeling
of
reality
clamping
down
and
bright
colors
going
dull
and
dreams
vanishing
yet
it
was
only
then
i
also
realized
how
much
bruce
had
moved
us
maybe
some
of
us
to
the
verge
of
mutiny
even
i
was
mad
at
erich
for
what
he
was
doing
but
i
could
help
admiring
his
cockiness
i
was
still
under
the
spell
of
bruce
words
and
the
behind
them
but
then
erich
would
shift
around
a
bit
and
one
of
his
heels
would
kick
near
the
pushbuttons
and
i
wanted
to
stamp
with
spike
heels
on
every
button
on
his
uniform
i
know
exactly
what
i
felt
yet
yes
i
a
soldier
bruce
told
him
and
i
hope
you
wo
ever
have
to
worry
about
my
courage
because
it
going
to
take
more
courage
than
any
operation
we
ever
planned
ever
dreamed
of
to
carry
the
peace
message
to
the
other
places
and
to
the
of
the
cosmos
perhaps
it
will
be
a
fast
wicket
and
we
be
bowled
down
before
we
score
a
single
run
but
who
cares
we
may
at
least
see
our
real
masters
when
they
come
to
smash
us
and
for
me
that
will
be
a
deep
satisfaction
and
we
may
do
some
smashing
of
our
own
so
you
a
soldier
erich
said
his
smile
showing
his
teeth
bruce
i
admit
that
the
operations
you
been
on
were
rougher
than
anything
i
drew
in
my
first
hundred
sleeps
for
that
i
am
all
honest
sympathy
but
that
you
should
let
them
get
you
into
such
a
state
that
love
and
a
girl
can
turn
you
upside
down
and
start
you
babbling
about
peace
messages
yes
by
god
love
and
a
girl
have
changed
me
bruce
shouted
at
him
and
i
looked
around
at
lili
and
i
remembered
dave
saying
i
going
to
spain
and
i
wondered
if
anything
would
ever
again
make
my
face
flame
like
that
or
rather
they
made
me
stand
up
for
what
i
believed
in
all
along
they
made
me
erich
called
and
began
to
do
a
little
sissy
dance
on
the
bomb
that
set
my
teeth
on
edge
he
bent
his
wrists
and
elbows
at
arty
angles
and
stuck
out
a
hip
and
ducked
his
head
simperingly
and
blinked
his
eyes
very
fast
will
you
invite
me
to
the
wedding
bruce
have
to
get
another
best
man
but
i
will
be
the
flower
girl
and
throw
pretty
little
posies
to
all
the
distinguished
guests
here
mark
catch
kaby
one
for
you
greta
sch√∂n
ach
zwei
herzen
in
dreivierteltakt
what
the
hell
do
you
think
a
woman
is
bruce
raged
something
to
mess
around
with
in
your
spare
time
erich
kept
on
humming
two
hearts
in
waltz
time
and
jigging
around
to
it
damn
him
but
he
slipped
in
a
nod
to
bruce
and
a
precisely
so
i
knew
where
i
stood
but
it
was
no
news
to
me
very
well
bruce
said
let
leave
this
brown
shirt
to
amuse
himself
and
get
down
to
business
i
made
all
of
you
a
proposal
and
i
do
have
to
tell
you
how
serious
it
is
or
how
serious
lili
and
i
are
about
it
we
not
only
must
infiltrate
and
subvert
other
places
which
luckily
for
us
are
made
for
infiltration
we
also
must
make
contact
with
the
snakes
and
establish
working
relationships
with
their
demons
at
our
level
as
one
of
our
first
steps
that
stopped
erich
jig
and
got
enough
of
a
gasp
from
some
of
us
to
make
it
seem
to
come
from
practically
everybody
erich
used
it
to
work
a
change
of
pace
bruce
we
let
you
carry
this
foolery
further
than
we
should
you
seem
to
have
the
idea
that
because
anything
goes
in
the
place
dueling
drunkenness
so
you
can
say
what
you
have
and
it
will
all
be
forgotten
with
the
hangover
not
so
it
is
true
that
among
such
a
set
of
monsters
and
free
spirits
as
ourselves
and
working
as
secret
agents
to
boot
there
can
not
be
the
obvious
military
discipline
that
would
obtain
in
a
terran
army
but
let
me
tell
you
bruce
let
me
grind
it
home
into
you
sid
and
kaby
and
mark
will
bear
me
out
in
this
as
officers
of
equivalent
rank
that
the
spider
line
of
command
stretches
into
and
through
this
place
just
as
surely
as
the
word
of
rules
chicago
and
as
i
have
to
emphasize
to
you
bruce
the
spiders
have
punishments
that
would
make
my
countrymen
in
belsen
and
buchenwald
well
pale
a
little
so
while
there
is
still
a
shadow
of
justification
for
our
interpreting
your
remarks
as
utterly
tasteless
clowning
babble
on
bruce
said
giving
him
a
loose
downward
wave
of
his
hand
without
looking
i
made
you
people
a
proposal
he
paused
how
do
you
stand
sidney
lessingham
then
i
felt
my
legs
getting
weak
because
sid
did
answer
right
away
the
old
boy
swallowed
and
started
to
look
around
at
the
rest
of
us
then
the
feeling
of
reality
clamping
down
got
something
awful
because
he
did
look
around
but
straightened
his
back
a
little
just
then
mark
cut
in
fast
it
grieves
me
bruce
but
i
think
you
are
possessed
erich
he
must
be
confined
kaby
nodded
almost
absently
confine
or
kill
the
coward
whichever
is
easier
whip
the
woman
and
let
get
on
to
the
egyptian
battle
indeed
yes
mark
said
i
died
in
it
but
now
perhaps
no
longer
kaby
said
to
him
i
like
you
roman
bruce
was
smiling
barely
and
his
eyes
were
moving
and
fixing
you
ilhilihis
illy
squeak
box
had
never
sounded
mechanical
to
me
before
but
it
did
as
he
answered
i
a
lot
deeper
into
borrowed
time
than
the
rest
of
you
but
papa
still
loves
living
include
me
very
much
out
brucie
miss
davies
beside
me
maud
said
flatly
do
you
think
i
a
fool
beyond
her
i
saw
lili
and
i
thought
my
god
i
might
look
as
proud
if
i
were
in
her
shoes
but
i
sure
as
hell
would
look
as
confident
bruce
eyes
had
quite
come
to
beau
when
the
gambler
spoke
up
i
have
no
cause
to
like
you
sir
rather
the
opposite
but
this
place
has
come
to
bore
me
more
than
boston
and
i
have
always
found
it
difficult
to
resist
a
long
shot
a
very
long
one
i
fear
i
am
with
you
sir
there
was
a
pain
in
my
chest
and
a
roaring
in
my
ears
and
through
it
i
heard
sevensee
grunting
sicka
these
lousy
spiders
deal
me
in
and
then
doc
reared
up
in
front
of
the
bar
and
he
lost
his
hat
and
his
hair
was
wild
and
he
grabbed
an
empty
fifth
by
the
neck
and
broke
the
bottom
of
it
all
jagged
against
the
bar
and
he
waved
it
and
screeched
pauki
i
nyemetzi
and
right
behind
his
words
beau
sang
out
fast
the
english
of
it
kill
the
spiders
and
the
germans
and
doc
did
collapse
then
though
i
could
see
he
was
hanging
onto
the
bar
tight
with
his
other
hand
and
the
place
got
stiller
inside
and
out
than
i
ever
known
it
and
bruce
eyes
were
finally
moving
back
toward
sid
but
the
eyes
stopped
short
of
sid
and
i
heard
bruce
say
miss
forzane
and
i
thought
that
funny
and
i
started
to
look
around
at
the
countess
and
felt
all
the
eyes
and
i
realized
hey
that
me
but
this
ca
happen
to
me
to
the
others
yes
but
not
to
me
i
just
work
here
not
to
greta
no
no
no
but
it
had
and
the
eyes
did
let
go
and
the
silence
and
the
feeling
of
reality
were
godawful
and
i
said
to
myself
greta
you
got
to
say
something
if
only
a
suitable
word
and
then
suddenly
i
knew
what
the
silence
was
like
it
was
like
that
of
a
big
city
if
there
were
some
way
of
shutting
off
all
the
noise
in
one
second
it
was
like
erich
singing
when
the
piano
had
deserted
him
it
was
as
if
the
change
winds
should
ever
die
completely
and
i
knew
beforehand
what
had
happened
when
i
turned
my
back
on
them
all
the
ghostgirls
were
gone
the
major
maintainer
had
merely
been
switched
to
introvert
it
was
gone
too
illustration
chapter
we
examined
the
moss
between
the
bricks
and
found
it
undisturbed
you
looked
among
d
papers
of
course
and
into
the
books
of
the
library
certainly
we
opened
every
package
and
parcel
we
not
only
opened
every
book
but
we
turned
over
every
leaf
in
each
volume
poe
a
locked
room
three
hours
later
sid
and
i
plumped
down
on
the
couch
nearest
the
kitchen
though
too
tired
to
want
to
eat
for
a
while
yet
a
tighter
search
than
i
could
ever
have
cooked
up
had
shown
that
the
maintainer
was
not
in
the
place
of
course
it
had
to
be
in
the
place
as
we
kept
telling
each
other
for
the
first
two
hours
it
had
to
be
if
circumstances
and
the
theories
we
lived
by
in
the
change
world
meant
anything
a
maintainer
is
what
maintains
a
place
the
minor
maintainer
takes
care
of
oxygen
temperature
humidity
gravity
and
other
little
and
things
generally
but
it
the
major
maintainer
that
keeps
the
walls
from
buckling
and
the
ceiling
from
falling
in
it
is
little
but
oh
my
it
does
so
much
it
does
work
by
wires
or
radio
or
anything
complicated
like
that
it
just
hooks
into
local
i
have
been
told
that
its
inside
working
part
is
made
up
of
vastly
tough
vastly
hard
giant
molecules
each
one
of
which
is
practically
a
cosmos
in
itself
outside
it
looks
like
a
portable
radio
with
a
few
more
dials
and
some
telltales
and
switches
and
for
earphones
and
a
lot
of
other
sensory
thingumajigs
but
the
maintainer
was
gone
and
the
void
had
closed
in
yet
by
this
time
i
was
so
fagged
i
did
care
much
whether
it
did
or
not
one
thing
for
sure
the
maintainer
had
been
switched
to
introvert
before
it
was
spirited
away
or
else
its
disappearance
automatically
produced
introversion
take
your
choice
because
we
sure
were
introverted
real
nasty
grip
of
reality
on
my
thoughts
that
i
knew
without
trying
liquor
would
soften
not
a
breath
of
change
wind
absolutely
stifling
and
the
gray
of
the
void
seeming
so
much
inside
my
head
that
i
think
i
got
a
glimmering
of
what
the
science
boys
mean
when
they
explain
to
me
that
the
place
is
a
kind
of
interweaving
of
the
material
and
the
mental
a
giant
monad
one
of
them
called
it
anyway
i
said
to
myself
greta
if
this
is
introversion
i
want
no
part
of
it
it
is
not
nice
to
be
cut
adrift
from
the
cosmos
and
know
it
a
lifeboat
in
the
middle
of
the
pacific
and
a
starship
between
galaxies
are
not
in
it
for
loneliness
i
asked
myself
why
the
spiders
had
ever
equipped
maintainers
with
introversion
switches
anyway
when
we
could
drill
with
them
and
were
supposed
to
use
them
except
in
an
emergency
so
tight
that
it
was
either
introvert
or
surrender
to
the
snakes
and
for
the
first
time
the
obvious
explanation
came
to
me
introversion
must
be
the
same
as
scuttling
its
main
purpose
to
withhold
secrets
and
materiel
from
the
enemy
it
put
a
place
into
a
situation
from
which
even
the
spider
high
command
could
rescue
it
and
there
was
nothing
left
but
to
sink
down
down
out
up
down
into
the
void
if
that
was
the
case
our
chances
of
getting
back
were
about
those
of
my
being
a
kid
again
playing
in
the
dunes
on
the
small
time
i
edged
a
little
closer
to
sid
and
sort
of
squunched
under
his
shoulder
and
rubbed
my
cheek
against
the
smudged
gray
velvet
he
looked
down
and
i
said
a
long
way
to
lynn
regis
eh
siddy
sweetling
thou
spokest
a
mouthful
he
said
he
knows
very
well
what
he
is
doing
when
he
mixes
his
language
that
way
the
wicked
old
darling
siddy
i
said
why
this
it
be
a
lot
smoother
without
it
marry
men
must
prick
themselves
out
and
i
know
not
but
it
helps
if
there
metal
in
it
and
girls
get
scratched
i
took
a
little
sniff
but
do
put
this
doublet
through
the
cleaner
yet
until
we
get
out
of
the
woods
i
want
as
much
you
around
as
possible
marry
and
why
should
i
he
asked
blankly
and
i
think
he
fooling
me
the
last
thing
time
travelers
find
out
is
how
they
do
or
do
smell
then
his
face
clouded
and
he
looked
as
though
he
wanted
to
squunch
under
my
shoulder
but
sweetling
your
forest
has
a
few
more
trees
than
sherwood
thou
saidst
it
i
agreed
and
wondered
about
the
look
he
ought
to
be
interested
in
my
girlishness
now
i
knew
i
was
a
mess
but
he
had
stuck
pretty
close
to
me
during
the
hunt
and
you
never
can
tell
then
i
remembered
that
he
was
the
other
one
who
had
declared
himself
when
bruce
was
putting
it
to
us
and
it
probably
troubled
his
male
vanity
not
me
though
i
was
still
grateful
to
the
maintainer
for
getting
me
out
of
that
spot
whatever
other
it
had
got
us
all
into
it
seemed
ages
ago
we
all
jumped
to
the
conclusion
that
the
two
ghostgirls
had
run
away
with
the
maintainer
i
do
know
where
or
why
but
it
looked
so
much
that
way
maud
had
started
yipping
about
how
she
never
trusted
ghosts
and
always
known
that
some
day
they
start
doing
things
on
their
own
and
kaby
had
got
it
firmly
fixed
in
her
head
right
between
the
horns
that
phryne
being
a
greek
was
the
ringleader
and
was
going
to
wreak
havoc
on
us
all
but
when
we
were
checking
stores
the
first
time
i
had
noticed
that
the
ghostgirl
envelopes
looked
flat
ectoplasm
does
take
up
much
space
when
it
folded
but
i
had
opened
one
anyway
then
another
and
then
called
for
help
every
last
envelope
was
empty
we
had
lost
over
a
thousand
ghostgirls
sid
whole
stock
well
at
least
it
proved
what
none
of
us
had
ever
seen
or
heard
of
being
demonstrated
that
there
is
a
spooky
link
a
sort
of
change
wind
contact
between
a
ghost
and
its
lifeline
and
when
that
umbilicus
heard
it
called
is
cut
the
part
away
from
the
lifeline
dies
interesting
but
what
had
bothered
me
was
whether
we
demons
were
going
to
evaporate
too
because
we
are
as
much
doublegangers
as
the
ghosts
and
our
apron
strings
had
been
cut
just
as
surely
we
more
solid
of
course
but
that
would
only
mean
we
take
a
little
longer
very
logical
i
remember
i
had
looked
up
at
lili
and
maud
us
girls
had
been
checking
the
envelopes
it
one
of
the
proprieties
we
frequently
maintain
and
anyway
if
men
check
them
they
apt
to
trot
out
that
old
wheeze
about
instant
women
which
i
sick
to
death
of
hearing
thank
you
anyway
i
had
looked
up
and
said
it
been
nice
knowing
you
and
lili
had
said
skiddoo
and
maud
had
said
here
goes
nothing
and
we
had
shook
hands
all
around
we
figured
that
phryne
and
the
countess
had
faded
at
the
same
time
as
the
other
ghostgirls
but
an
idea
had
been
nibbling
at
me
and
i
said
siddy
do
you
suppose
it
just
barely
possible
that
while
we
were
all
looking
at
bruce
those
two
ghostgirls
would
have
been
able
to
work
the
maintainer
and
get
a
door
and
lam
out
of
here
with
the
thing
thou
speakst
my
thoughts
sweetling
all
weighs
against
it
imprimis
well
known
that
ghosts
can
not
lay
plots
or
act
on
them
secundo
the
time
forbade
getting
a
door
tercio
and
here
the
real
meat
of
it
the
place
folds
without
the
maintainer
quadro
folly
to
depend
on
not
one
of
how
many
of
us
ten
elf
not
looking
around
in
all
the
time
it
would
have
taken
them
i
looked
around
once
siddy
they
were
drinking
and
they
had
got
to
the
control
divan
under
their
own
power
now
when
was
that
oh
yes
when
bruce
was
talking
about
zombies
yes
sweetling
and
as
i
was
about
to
cap
my
argument
with
quinquo
when
you
prattle
i
could
have
sworn
none
could
touch
the
maintainer
much
less
work
it
and
purloin
it
without
my
certain
knowledge
yet
eftsoons
yet
i
seconded
him
somebody
must
have
got
a
door
and
walked
out
with
the
thing
it
certainly
was
in
the
place
the
hunt
had
been
a
lulu
something
the
size
of
a
portable
typewriter
is
not
easy
to
hide
and
we
had
been
inside
everything
from
beau
piano
to
the
renewer
link
of
the
refresher
we
had
even
fluoroscoped
everybody
though
it
had
made
illy
writhe
like
a
box
of
worms
as
he
warned
us
he
said
it
tickled
terribly
and
i
insisted
on
smoothing
his
fur
for
five
minutes
afterward
although
he
was
a
little
standoffish
toward
me
some
areas
like
the
bar
kitchen
and
stores
took
a
long
while
but
we
were
thorough
kaby
helped
doc
check
surgery
since
she
last
made
the
place
she
has
been
stationed
in
a
field
hospital
it
turns
out
the
spiders
actually
are
mounting
operations
from
them
and
learned
a
few
nice
new
wrinkles
however
doc
put
in
some
honest
work
on
his
own
though
of
course
every
check
was
observed
by
at
least
three
people
not
including
bruce
or
lili
when
the
maintainer
vanished
doc
had
pulled
out
of
his
drunk
in
a
way
that
would
have
surprised
me
if
i
had
seen
it
happen
to
him
before
but
when
we
finished
surgery
and
got
on
to
the
art
gallery
he
had
started
to
putter
and
i
noticed
him
hold
out
his
coat
and
duck
his
head
and
whip
out
a
flask
and
take
a
swig
and
by
now
he
was
well
on
his
way
toward
another
peak
the
art
gallery
had
taken
time
too
because
there
such
a
jumble
of
strange
stuff
and
it
broke
my
heart
but
kaby
took
her
ax
and
split
a
beautiful
blue
woodcarving
of
a
venusian
medusa
because
although
there
was
a
mark
in
the
surface
she
claimed
it
was
just
big
enough
doc
cried
a
little
and
we
left
him
fitting
the
pieces
together
and
mooning
over
the
other
stuff
after
we
finished
everything
else
mark
had
insisted
on
tackling
the
floor
beau
and
sid
both
tried
to
explain
to
him
how
this
is
a
place
that
there
is
nothing
but
nothing
under
the
floor
it
just
gets
a
lot
harder
than
the
diamonds
crusting
it
as
soon
as
you
get
a
quarter
inch
down
that
being
the
solid
equivalent
of
the
void
but
mark
was
like
all
romans
sid
assured
me
on
the
and
broke
four
drills
before
he
was
satisfied
except
for
some
trick
hiding
places
that
left
the
void
and
things
do
vanish
if
you
throw
them
at
the
void
they
half
melt
and
freeze
forever
unless
you
can
fish
them
out
back
of
the
refresher
at
about
are
three
venusian
coconuts
that
a
hittite
strongman
threw
there
during
a
major
brawl
i
try
not
to
look
at
them
because
they
are
so
much
like
witch
heads
they
give
me
the
woolies
the
parts
of
the
place
right
up
against
the
void
have
strange
spatial
properties
which
one
of
the
gadgets
in
surgery
makes
use
of
in
a
way
that
gives
me
the
worse
woolies
but
that
beside
the
point
during
the
hunt
kaby
and
erich
had
used
their
callers
as
direction
finders
to
point
out
the
maintainer
just
as
they
used
in
the
cosmos
to
locate
the
door
and
sometimes
in
the
big
places
people
tell
me
but
the
callers
only
went
wild
like
a
compass
needle
whirling
around
without
stopping
and
nobody
knew
what
that
meant
the
trick
hiding
places
were
the
minor
maintainer
a
cute
idea
but
it
is
no
bigger
than
the
major
and
has
its
own
mysterious
insides
and
had
obviously
kept
on
doing
its
own
work
so
that
was
out
for
several
reasons
and
the
bomb
chest
though
it
seemed
impossible
for
anyone
to
have
opened
it
granting
they
knew
the
secret
of
its
lock
even
before
erich
jumped
on
it
and
put
it
in
the
limelight
double
but
when
ruled
out
everything
else
the
word
impossible
changes
meaning
since
time
travel
is
our
business
a
person
might
think
of
all
sorts
of
tricks
for
sending
the
maintainer
into
the
past
or
future
permanently
or
temporarily
but
the
place
is
strictly
on
the
big
time
and
everybody
that
should
know
tells
me
that
time
traveling
the
big
time
is
out
it
this
way
the
big
time
is
a
train
and
the
little
time
is
the
countryside
and
we
on
the
train
unless
we
go
out
a
door
and
as
gertie
stein
might
put
it
you
ca
time
travel
through
the
time
you
time
travel
in
when
you
time
travel
i
also
played
around
with
the
idea
of
some
fantastically
obvious
hiding
place
maybe
something
that
several
people
could
pass
back
and
forth
between
them
which
would
mean
a
conspiracy
and
of
course
if
you
assume
a
big
enough
conspiracy
you
can
explain
anything
including
the
cosmos
itself
still
i
got
a
sort
of
idea
about
the
soldiers
three
big
black
shakos
and
i
had
been
satisfied
until
got
the
three
together
and
looked
in
them
all
at
the
same
time
wake
up
greta
and
take
something
i
ca
stand
here
forever
maud
had
brought
us
a
tray
of
hearty
snacks
from
then
and
yon
and
i
must
say
they
were
tempting
she
whips
up
a
mean
hors
i
looked
them
over
and
said
siddy
i
want
a
hot
dog
and
i
want
a
venison
pasty
out
upon
you
you
finical
jill
you
jade
you
whimsic
and
tyrannous
poppet
i
grabbed
a
handful
and
snuggled
back
against
him
go
on
call
me
some
more
siddy
i
told
him
real
juicy
ones
chapter
my
thought
whose
murder
yet
is
but
fantastical
shakes
so
my
single
state
of
man
that
function
is
smother
in
surmise
and
nothing
is
but
what
is
not
macbeth
motives
and
opportunities
my
big
bad
waif
from
king
lynn
had
set
the
tray
on
his
knees
and
started
to
wolf
the
food
down
the
others
were
finishing
up
erich
mark
and
kaby
were
having
a
quietly
furious
argument
i
could
overhear
at
the
end
of
the
bar
nearest
the
bronze
chest
and
illy
was
draped
over
the
piano
like
a
real
octopus
listening
in
beau
and
sevensee
were
pacing
up
and
down
near
the
control
divan
and
throwing
each
other
a
word
now
and
then
beyond
them
bruce
and
lili
were
sitting
on
the
opposite
couch
from
us
talking
earnestly
about
something
maud
had
sat
down
at
the
other
end
of
the
bar
and
was
knitting
it
one
of
the
habits
like
chess
and
quiet
drinking
or
learning
to
talk
by
squeak
box
that
we
pick
up
to
pass
the
time
in
the
place
in
the
long
stretches
between
parties
doc
was
fiddling
around
the
gallery
picking
things
up
and
setting
them
down
still
managing
to
stay
on
his
feet
at
any
rate
lili
and
bruce
stood
up
still
gabbing
intensely
at
each
other
and
illy
began
to
pick
out
with
one
tentacle
a
little
tune
in
the
high
keys
that
did
sound
like
anything
on
god
earth
where
do
they
get
all
the
energy
i
wondered
as
soon
as
i
asked
myself
that
i
knew
the
answer
and
i
began
to
feel
the
same
way
myself
it
was
energy
it
was
nerves
pure
and
simple
change
is
like
a
drug
i
realized
you
get
used
to
the
facts
never
staying
the
same
and
one
picture
of
the
past
and
future
dissolving
into
another
maybe
not
very
different
but
still
different
and
your
mind
being
constantly
goosed
by
strange
moods
and
notions
like
nightclub
lights
of
shifting
color
with
weird
shadows
between
shining
right
on
your
brain
the
endless
swaying
and
jogging
is
restful
like
riding
on
a
train
you
soon
get
to
like
the
movement
and
to
need
it
without
knowing
and
when
it
suddenly
stops
and
you
just
you
and
the
facts
you
think
from
and
feel
from
are
exactly
the
same
when
you
go
back
to
them
boy
rough
as
i
found
out
now
the
instant
we
got
introverted
everything
that
ordinarily
leaks
into
the
place
wake
or
sleep
had
stopped
coming
and
we
were
nothing
but
ourselves
and
what
we
meant
to
each
other
and
what
we
could
make
of
that
an
awfully
lonely
scratchy
situation
i
decided
i
felt
like
i
been
dropped
into
a
swimming
pool
full
of
cement
and
held
under
until
it
hardened
i
could
understand
the
others
bouncing
around
a
bit
it
was
a
wonder
they
did
hit
the
void
maud
seemed
to
be
standing
it
the
best
maybe
she
got
a
little
preparation
from
the
long
watches
between
stars
and
then
she
is
older
than
all
of
us
even
sid
though
with
a
small
o
in
older
the
restless
work
of
the
search
for
the
maintainer
had
masked
the
feeling
but
now
it
was
beginning
to
come
full
force
before
the
search
bruce
speech
and
erich
interruptions
had
done
a
passable
masking
job
too
i
tried
to
remember
when
i
first
got
the
feeling
and
decided
it
was
after
erich
had
jumped
on
the
bomb
about
the
time
he
mentioned
poetry
though
i
could
be
sure
maybe
the
maintainer
had
been
introverted
even
earlier
when
i
turned
to
look
at
the
ghostgirls
i
would
have
known
nuts
believe
me
i
could
feel
that
hardened
cement
on
every
inch
of
me
i
remembered
bruce
beautiful
picture
of
a
universe
without
big
change
and
decided
it
was
about
the
worst
idea
going
i
went
on
eating
though
i
was
so
sure
now
it
was
a
good
idea
to
keep
myself
strong
does
the
maintainer
have
an
introversion
telltale
siddy
chit
and
you
love
me
speak
lower
of
a
sudden
i
feel
not
well
as
if
i
drunk
a
butt
of
rhenish
and
slept
inside
it
marry
yes
blue
in
short
flashes
saith
the
manual
why
thou
no
reason
god
siddy
what
i
give
for
a
breath
of
change
wind
thou
say
that
eftsoons
he
groaned
i
must
have
looked
pretty
miserable
myself
for
he
put
his
arm
around
my
shoulders
and
whispered
gruffly
comfort
thyself
sweetling
that
while
we
suffer
thus
sorely
we
yet
can
not
die
the
change
death
what
that
i
asked
him
i
did
want
to
bounce
around
like
the
others
i
had
a
suspicion
carry
it
too
far
so
to
keep
myself
from
going
batty
i
started
to
rework
the
business
of
who
had
done
what
to
the
maintainer
during
the
hunt
there
had
been
some
pretty
wild
suggestions
tossed
around
as
to
its
disappearance
or
at
least
its
introversion
a
feat
of
snake
science
amounting
to
sorcery
the
spider
high
command
bunkering
the
places
from
above
perhaps
in
reaction
to
the
loss
of
the
express
room
in
such
a
hurry
that
they
had
even
time
to
transmit
warnings
the
hand
of
the
late
cosmicians
those
mysterious
hypothetical
beings
who
are
supposed
to
have
successfully
resisted
the
extension
of
the
change
war
into
the
future
much
beyond
sevensee
epoch
unless
the
late
cosmicians
are
the
ones
fighting
the
change
war
one
thing
these
suggestions
had
steered
very
clear
of
was
naming
any
one
of
us
as
a
suspect
whether
acting
as
snake
spy
spider
political
police
agent
of
who
knows
after
bruce
a
secret
change
world
committee
of
public
safety
or
spider
revolutionary
underground
or
strictly
on
our
own
just
as
no
one
had
piped
a
word
since
the
maintainer
had
been
palmed
about
the
split
between
erich
and
factions
good
group
thinking
probably
to
sink
differences
in
the
emergency
but
that
did
apply
to
what
i
did
with
my
own
thoughts
who
wanted
to
escape
so
bad
they
introvert
the
place
cutting
off
all
possible
contact
and
communication
either
way
with
the
cosmos
and
running
the
very
big
risk
of
not
getting
back
to
the
cosmos
at
all
leaving
out
what
had
happened
since
bruce
had
arrived
and
stirred
things
up
doc
seemed
to
me
to
have
the
strongest
motive
he
knew
that
sid
could
keep
covering
up
for
him
forever
and
that
spider
punishments
for
derelictions
of
duty
are
not
just
the
clink
of
a
firing
squad
as
erich
had
reminded
us
but
doc
had
been
flat
on
the
floor
in
front
of
the
bar
from
the
time
bruce
had
jumped
on
top
of
it
though
i
certainly
had
had
my
eye
on
him
every
second
beau
beau
had
said
he
was
bored
with
the
place
at
a
time
when
what
he
said
counted
so
he
hardly
lock
himself
in
it
maybe
forever
not
to
mention
locking
bruce
in
with
himself
and
the
babe
he
had
a
yen
for
sid
loves
reality
changing
or
not
and
every
least
thing
in
it
people
especially
more
than
any
man
or
woman
i
ever
known
he
like
a
baby
who
wants
to
grab
every
object
and
put
it
in
his
mouth
and
it
was
hard
to
imagine
him
ever
cutting
himself
off
from
the
cosmos
maud
kaby
mark
and
the
two
ets
none
of
them
had
any
motive
i
knew
of
though
sevensee
being
from
the
very
far
future
did
tie
in
with
that
idea
about
the
late
cosmicians
and
there
did
seem
to
be
something
developing
between
the
cretan
and
the
roman
that
could
make
them
want
to
be
introverted
together
stick
to
the
facts
greta
i
reminded
myself
with
a
private
groan
that
left
erich
bruce
lili
and
myself
erich
i
thought
now
we
getting
somewhere
the
little
commandant
has
the
nervous
system
of
a
coyote
and
the
courage
of
a
crazy
tomcat
and
if
he
thought
it
would
help
him
settle
his
battle
with
bruce
better
to
be
locked
in
with
him
he
do
it
in
a
second
but
even
before
erich
had
danced
on
the
bomb
he
been
heckling
bruce
from
the
crowd
still
there
would
have
been
time
between
heckles
for
him
to
step
quietly
back
from
us
introvert
the
maintainer
and
well
that
was
of
the
problem
if
i
was
the
guilty
party
i
was
nuts
and
that
was
the
best
explanation
of
all
bruce
motives
seemed
so
obvious
especially
the
mortal
or
was
it
immortal
danger
he
put
himself
in
by
inciting
mutiny
that
it
seemed
a
shame
he
been
in
full
view
on
the
bar
so
long
surely
if
the
maintainer
had
been
introverted
before
he
jumped
on
the
bar
we
all
have
noticed
the
flashing
blue
telltale
for
that
matter
i
have
noticed
it
when
i
looked
back
at
the
ghostgirls
if
it
worked
as
sid
claimed
and
he
said
he
had
never
seen
it
in
operation
just
read
in
the
manual
oh
but
bruce
did
need
opportunity
as
i
sure
all
the
males
in
the
place
would
have
told
me
right
off
because
he
had
lili
to
pull
the
job
for
him
and
she
had
as
much
opportunity
as
any
of
the
rest
of
us
myself
i
have
large
reservations
to
this
theory
but
i
had
to
admit
there
was
something
to
be
said
for
it
in
this
case
and
it
had
seemed
quite
natural
to
me
when
the
rest
of
us
had
decided
by
unspoken
agreement
that
neither
lili
nor
bruce
checks
counted
when
we
were
hunting
for
the
maintainer
that
took
care
of
all
of
us
and
left
only
the
mysterious
stranger
intruding
somehow
through
a
door
how
he
get
it
without
using
our
maintainer
or
from
an
unimaginable
hiding
place
or
straight
out
of
the
void
itself
i
know
that
last
is
impossible
nothing
can
step
out
of
nothing
but
if
anything
ever
looked
like
it
was
specially
built
for
something
not
at
all
nice
to
come
looming
out
of
it
the
void
misty
foggily
churning
slimy
gray
wait
a
second
i
told
myself
and
hang
onto
this
greta
it
should
have
smacked
you
in
the
face
at
the
start
whatever
came
out
of
the
void
or
more
to
the
point
whoever
slipped
back
from
our
crowd
to
the
maintainer
bruce
would
have
seen
them
he
was
looking
at
the
maintainer
past
our
heads
the
whole
time
and
whatever
happened
to
it
he
saw
it
erich
would
have
even
after
he
was
on
the
bomb
because
he
been
stagewise
enough
to
face
bruce
most
of
the
time
to
build
up
his
role
as
tribune
of
the
people
but
bruce
would
have
unless
he
got
so
caught
up
in
what
he
was
saying
no
kid
a
demon
is
always
an
actor
no
matter
how
much
he
believes
in
what
he
saying
and
there
never
was
an
actor
yet
who
instantly
notice
a
member
of
the
audience
starting
to
walk
out
on
his
big
scene
so
bruce
knew
which
made
him
a
better
actor
than
i
have
been
willing
to
grant
since
it
did
look
as
if
anyone
else
had
thought
of
what
had
just
occurred
to
me
or
they
have
gone
over
and
put
it
to
him
not
me
though
i
do
work
that
way
besides
i
did
feel
up
to
it
nervy
anna
enfold
me
i
felt
like
pure
hell
maybe
i
told
myself
encouragingly
the
place
is
hell
but
added
be
your
age
greta
be
a
real
rootless
ruleless
ruthless
chapter
the
barrage
roars
and
lifts
then
clumsily
bowed
with
bombs
and
guns
and
shovels
and
battle
gear
men
jostle
and
climb
to
meet
the
bristling
fire
lines
of
gray
muttering
faces
masked
with
fear
they
leave
their
trenches
going
over
the
top
while
time
ticks
blank
and
busy
on
their
wrists
sassoon
the
western
front
please
do
lili
i
shall
my
love
sweetling
wake
up
hast
the
shakes
i
opened
my
eyes
a
little
and
lied
to
siddy
with
a
smile
and
locked
my
hands
together
tight
and
watched
bruce
and
lili
quarrel
nobly
near
the
control
divan
and
wished
i
had
a
great
love
to
blur
my
misery
and
provide
me
with
a
passable
substitute
for
change
winds
lili
won
the
argument
judging
from
the
way
she
threw
her
head
back
and
stepped
away
from
bruce
arms
while
giving
him
a
proud
tender
smile
he
walked
off
a
few
steps
praise
be
he
did
shrug
his
shoulders
at
us
like
an
old
husband
though
his
nerves
were
showing
and
he
seem
to
be
standing
introversion
well
at
all
as
who
of
us
were
lili
rested
a
hand
on
the
head
of
the
control
divan
and
pressed
her
lips
together
and
looked
around
at
us
mostly
with
her
eyes
she
wound
a
gray
silk
bandeau
around
her
bangs
her
short
gray
silk
dress
without
a
waistline
made
her
look
not
so
much
like
a
flapper
though
she
looked
like
that
all
right
as
like
a
little
girl
except
the
neckline
was
scooped
low
enough
to
show
she
was
her
gaze
hesitated
and
then
stopped
at
me
and
i
got
a
sunk
feeling
of
what
was
coming
because
women
are
always
picking
on
me
for
an
audience
besides
sid
and
i
were
the
centrist
party
of
two
in
our
place
politics
she
took
a
deep
breath
and
stuck
out
her
chin
and
said
in
a
voice
that
was
even
a
little
higher
and
britisher
than
she
usually
uses
we
girls
have
often
cried
the
door
but
now
the
door
is
jolly
well
shut
for
keeps
i
knew
i
guessed
right
and
i
felt
crawly
with
embarrassment
because
i
know
about
this
love
business
of
thinking
you
the
other
person
and
trying
to
live
their
life
and
grab
their
glory
though
you
do
know
that
and
carry
their
message
for
them
and
how
it
can
foul
things
up
still
i
could
help
admitting
what
she
said
was
too
bad
a
start
unpleasantly
apt
to
be
true
at
any
rate
my
fiance
believes
we
may
yet
be
able
to
open
the
door
i
do
not
he
thinks
it
is
a
bit
premature
to
discuss
the
peculiar
pickle
in
which
we
all
find
ourselves
i
do
not
there
was
a
rasp
of
laughter
from
the
bar
the
militarists
were
reacting
erich
stepped
out
looking
very
happy
so
now
we
have
to
listen
to
women
making
speeches
he
called
what
is
this
place
anyhow
sidney
lessingham
saturday
evening
sewing
circle
beau
and
sevensee
who
stopped
their
pacing
halfway
between
the
bar
and
the
control
divan
turned
toward
erich
and
sevensee
looked
a
little
burlier
a
little
more
like
half
a
horse
than
satyrs
in
mythology
book
illustrations
he
stamped
medium
hard
i
say
and
said
ahh
go
flya
kite
i
found
out
he
learned
english
from
a
demon
who
been
a
longshoreman
with
sympathies
erich
shut
up
for
a
moment
and
stood
there
grinning
his
hands
on
his
hips
lili
nodded
to
the
satyr
and
cleared
her
throat
looking
scared
but
she
did
speak
i
could
see
she
was
thinking
and
feeling
something
and
her
face
got
ugly
and
haggard
as
if
she
were
in
a
change
wind
that
had
reached
me
yet
and
her
mouth
went
into
a
snarl
to
fight
tears
but
some
spurted
out
and
when
she
did
speak
her
voice
was
an
octave
lower
and
it
was
just
london
talking
but
new
york
too
i
do
know
how
resurrection
felt
to
you
people
because
i
new
and
i
loathe
asking
questions
but
to
me
it
was
pure
torture
and
i
wished
only
i
had
the
courage
to
tell
suzaku
wish
to
remain
a
zombie
if
you
do
mind
i
rather
the
nightmares
but
i
accepted
resurrection
because
i
been
taught
to
be
polite
and
because
there
is
the
demon
in
me
i
do
understand
that
always
wishes
to
live
and
i
found
that
i
still
felt
like
a
zombie
although
i
could
flit
about
and
that
i
still
had
the
nightmares
except
they
grown
a
deal
vivider
i
was
a
young
girl
again
seventeen
and
i
suppose
every
woman
wishes
to
be
seventeen
but
i
was
seventeen
inside
my
head
i
was
a
woman
who
had
died
of
bright
disease
in
new
york
in
and
also
because
a
big
change
blew
my
lifeline
into
a
new
drift
a
woman
who
had
died
of
the
same
disease
in
london
in
but
rather
more
slowly
because
as
you
can
fancy
the
liquor
was
in
far
shorter
supply
i
had
to
live
with
both
those
sets
of
memories
and
the
change
world
blot
them
out
any
more
than
i
told
it
does
those
of
any
demon
and
it
did
even
push
them
into
the
background
as
i
hoped
it
would
when
some
change
fellow
would
say
to
me
beautiful
how
about
a
smile
or
a
posh
frock
kiddo
i
be
back
at
bellevue
looking
down
at
my
swollen
figure
and
the
light
getting
like
spokes
of
ice
or
in
that
dreadful
stepney
bedroom
with
phyllis
coughing
herself
to
death
beside
me
or
at
best
for
a
moment
a
little
girl
in
glamorgan
looking
at
the
roman
road
and
wondering
about
the
wonderful
life
that
lay
ahead
i
looked
at
erich
remembering
he
had
a
long
nasty
future
back
in
the
cosmos
himself
and
at
any
rate
he
was
smiling
and
i
thought
maybe
he
getting
a
little
humility
knowing
someone
else
has
two
of
those
futures
but
i
doubted
it
because
you
see
lili
kept
forcing
it
out
all
my
three
lives
been
a
girl
who
fell
in
love
with
a
great
young
poet
she
never
met
the
voice
of
the
new
youth
and
all
youth
and
she
told
her
first
big
lie
to
get
in
the
red
cross
and
across
to
france
to
be
nearer
him
and
it
was
all
danger
and
dark
magics
and
a
knight
in
armor
and
she
pictured
how
she
find
him
wounded
but
not
seriously
with
a
little
bandage
around
his
head
and
she
light
a
fag
for
him
and
smile
lightly
never
letting
him
guess
what
she
felt
but
only
being
her
best
self
and
watching
to
see
if
that
made
something
happen
to
him
and
then
the
boche
machine
guns
cut
him
down
at
passchendaele
and
there
could
ever
have
been
bandages
big
enough
and
the
girl
stayed
seventeen
inside
and
messed
about
and
tried
to
be
wicked
though
she
was
very
good
at
that
and
to
drink
and
she
had
a
bit
more
talent
there
though
drinking
yourself
to
death
is
not
nearly
as
easy
as
it
sounds
even
with
a
kidney
weakness
to
help
but
she
turned
the
trick
then
a
cock
crows
she
wakes
with
a
tearing
start
from
the
gray
dreams
of
death
that
fill
her
lifeline
it
cold
daybreak
there
the
smell
of
a
french
farm
she
feels
her
ankles
and
they
not
at
all
like
huge
rubber
boots
filled
with
water
they
not
swollen
the
least
bit
they
young
legs
there
a
little
window
and
the
tops
of
a
row
of
trees
that
may
be
poplars
when
there
more
light
and
what
there
is
shows
cots
like
her
own
and
heads
under
blankets
and
hanging
uniforms
make
large
shadows
and
a
girl
is
snoring
there
a
very
distant
rumble
and
it
moves
the
window
a
bit
then
she
remembers
they
red
cross
girls
many
many
kilometers
from
passchendaele
and
that
bruce
marchant
is
going
to
die
at
dawn
today
in
a
few
more
minutes
he
going
over
the
top
where
there
a
in
field
gray
already
looking
down
the
sights
and
swinging
the
gun
a
bit
but
she
is
going
to
die
today
going
to
die
in
and
and
just
as
she
going
mad
there
a
creaking
and
out
of
the
shadows
tiptoes
a
jap
with
a
woman
hairdo
and
the
whitest
face
and
the
blackest
eyebrows
he
wearing
a
rose
robe
and
a
black
sash
which
belts
to
his
sides
two
samurai
swords
but
in
his
right
hand
he
has
a
strange
silver
pistol
and
he
smiles
at
her
as
if
they
were
brother
and
sister
and
lovers
at
the
same
time
and
he
says
vivre
mademoiselle
and
she
stares
and
he
bobs
his
head
and
says
wish
live
yes
no
illustration
sid
paw
closed
quietly
around
my
shaking
hands
it
always
gets
me
to
hear
about
anyone
resurrection
and
although
mine
was
crazier
it
also
had
the
krauts
in
it
i
hoped
she
would
go
through
the
rest
of
the
formula
and
she
did
five
minutes
later
he
gone
down
a
stairs
more
like
a
ladder
to
wait
below
and
she
dressing
in
a
rush
her
clothes
resist
a
little
as
if
they
were
lightly
gummed
to
the
hook
and
the
stained
wall
and
she
hates
to
touch
them
it
getting
lighter
and
her
cot
looks
as
if
someone
were
still
sleeping
there
although
it
empty
and
she
could
bring
herself
to
put
her
hand
on
the
place
if
her
new
life
depended
on
it
she
climbs
down
and
her
long
skirt
does
bother
her
because
she
knows
how
to
swing
it
suzaku
conducts
her
past
a
sentry
who
does
see
them
and
a
farmer
in
a
smock
coughing
and
spitting
the
night
out
of
his
throat
they
cross
the
farmyard
and
it
filled
with
rose
light
and
she
sees
the
sun
is
up
and
she
knows
that
bruce
marchant
has
just
bled
to
death
there
an
empty
open
touring
car
chugging
loudly
waiting
for
someone
it
has
huge
muddy
wheels
with
wooden
spokes
and
a
brass
radiator
that
says
but
suzaku
leads
her
past
it
to
a
dunghill
and
bows
apologetically
and
she
steps
through
a
door
i
heard
erich
say
to
the
others
at
the
bar
how
touching
now
shall
i
tell
everyone
about
my
operation
but
he
did
get
much
of
a
laugh
that
how
lilian
foster
came
into
the
change
world
with
its
nightmares
and
its
deadly
pace
and
deadlier
lassitudes
i
was
more
alive
than
i
ever
had
been
before
but
it
was
the
kind
of
life
a
corpse
might
get
from
unending
electrical
shocks
and
i
could
summon
any
purpose
or
hope
and
bruce
marchant
seemed
farther
away
than
ever
then
not
six
hours
ago
a
soldier
in
a
black
uniform
came
through
the
door
and
i
thought
ca
be
but
it
does
look
like
his
photographs
and
then
i
thought
i
heard
someone
say
the
name
bruce
and
then
he
shouted
as
if
to
all
the
world
that
he
was
bruce
marchant
and
i
knew
there
was
a
resurrection
beyond
resurrection
a
true
resurrection
oh
bruce
she
looked
at
him
and
he
was
crying
and
smiling
and
all
the
young
beauty
flooded
back
into
her
face
and
i
thought
it
has
to
be
change
winds
but
it
ca
be
face
it
without
slobbering
greta
there
something
that
works
bigger
miracles
than
change
and
she
went
on
and
then
the
change
winds
died
when
the
snakes
vaporized
the
maintainer
or
the
ghostgirls
introverted
it
and
all
three
of
them
vanished
so
swiftly
and
silently
that
even
bruce
notice
those
are
the
best
explanations
i
can
summon
and
i
fancy
one
of
them
is
true
at
all
events
the
change
winds
died
and
my
past
and
even
my
futures
became
something
i
could
bear
lightly
because
i
have
someone
to
bear
them
with
me
and
because
at
last
i
have
a
true
future
stretching
out
ahead
of
me
an
unknown
future
which
i
shall
create
by
living
oh
do
you
see
that
all
of
us
have
it
now
this
big
opportunity
for
sidney
suffragettes
and
the
erich
cheered
beau
will
you
play
us
a
medley
of
and
flowers
and
christian
soldiers
i
deeply
moved
lili
where
do
the
rest
of
us
queue
up
for
the
great
love
affair
of
the
century
chapter
now
is
a
bearable
burden
what
buckles
the
back
is
the
added
weight
of
the
past
mistakes
and
the
future
fears
i
had
to
learn
to
close
the
front
door
to
tomorrow
and
the
back
door
to
yesterday
and
settle
down
to
here
and
now
anonymous
a
big
opportunity
nobody
laughed
at
erich
screwball
sarcasms
and
still
i
thought
yes
perish
his
hysterical
little
gray
head
but
he
half
right
lili
got
the
big
thing
now
and
she
wants
to
serve
it
up
to
the
rest
of
us
on
a
platter
only
love
does
cook
and
cut
that
way
those
were
bad
ideas
she
had
about
the
maintainer
though
especially
the
one
about
the
ghostgirls
doing
the
introverting
it
would
explain
why
there
could
be
introversion
drill
the
manual
stuff
about
blue
flashes
being
and
something
disappearing
without
movement
or
transition
is
the
sort
of
thing
that
might
not
catch
the
attention
and
i
guess
they
gave
the
others
something
to
think
about
too
for
there
was
any
to
erich
frantic
sniping
but
i
honestly
did
see
where
there
was
this
big
opportunity
being
stuck
away
in
a
gray
sack
in
the
void
and
i
began
to
wonder
and
i
got
the
strangest
feeling
and
i
said
to
myself
hang
onto
your
hat
greta
it
hope
the
dreadful
thing
about
being
a
demon
is
that
you
have
all
time
to
range
through
lili
was
saying
with
a
smile
you
can
never
shut
the
back
door
to
yesterday
or
the
front
door
to
tomorrow
and
simply
live
in
the
present
but
now
that
been
done
for
us
the
door
is
shut
we
need
never
again
rehash
the
past
or
the
future
the
spiders
and
snakes
can
never
find
us
for
who
ever
heard
of
a
place
that
was
truly
lost
being
rescued
and
as
those
in
the
know
have
told
me
introversion
is
the
end
as
far
as
those
outside
are
concerned
so
we
safe
from
the
spiders
and
snakes
we
need
never
be
slaves
or
enemies
again
and
we
have
a
place
in
which
to
live
our
new
lives
the
place
prepared
for
us
from
the
beginning
she
paused
surely
you
understand
what
i
mean
sidney
and
beauregard
and
pyeshkov
are
the
ones
who
explained
it
to
me
the
place
is
a
balanced
aquarium
just
like
the
cosmos
no
one
knows
how
many
ages
of
big
time
it
has
been
in
use
without
a
bit
of
new
material
being
brought
in
only
luxuries
and
people
and
not
a
bit
of
waste
cast
off
no
one
knows
how
many
more
ages
it
may
not
sustain
life
i
never
heard
of
minor
maintainers
wearing
out
we
have
all
the
future
all
the
security
anyone
can
hope
for
we
have
a
place
to
live
together
you
know
she
was
dead
right
and
i
realized
that
all
the
time
i
had
the
conviction
in
the
back
of
my
mind
that
we
were
going
to
suffocate
or
something
if
we
did
get
a
door
open
pretty
quick
i
should
have
known
differently
if
anybody
should
because
i
once
been
in
the
place
without
a
door
for
as
long
as
a
hundred
sleeps
during
a
foxhole
stretch
of
the
change
war
and
we
had
to
start
cycling
our
food
and
it
had
been
okay
and
then
because
it
is
also
the
way
my
mind
works
i
started
to
picture
in
a
flash
the
consequences
of
our
living
together
all
by
ourselves
like
lili
said
i
began
to
pair
people
off
i
could
help
it
let
see
four
women
six
men
two
ets
greta
i
said
you
going
to
be
miss
polly
andry
for
sure
have
a
daily
newspaper
and
classes
we
shut
the
bar
except
evenings
bruce
keep
a
rhymed
history
of
the
place
i
even
thought
though
i
knew
this
part
was
strictly
silly
about
schools
and
children
i
wondered
what
siddy
would
look
like
or
my
little
commandant
do
go
near
the
void
dears
of
course
that
would
be
specially
hard
on
the
two
ets
but
sevensee
at
least
was
so
different
and
the
genetics
boys
had
made
some
wonderful
advances
and
maud
ought
to
know
about
them
and
there
were
some
amazing
gadgets
in
surgery
when
doc
sobered
up
the
patter
of
little
hoofs
my
fiance
spoke
to
you
about
carrying
a
peace
message
to
the
rest
of
the
cosmos
lili
added
and
bringing
an
end
to
the
big
change
and
healing
all
the
wounds
that
have
been
made
in
the
little
time
i
looked
at
bruce
his
face
was
set
and
strained
as
will
happen
to
the
best
of
them
when
a
girl
starts
talking
about
her
man
business
and
i
do
know
why
but
i
said
to
myself
she
crucifying
him
nailing
him
to
his
purpose
as
a
woman
will
even
when
there
not
much
point
to
it
as
now
and
lili
went
on
it
was
a
wonderful
thought
but
now
we
can
not
carry
or
send
any
message
and
i
believe
it
is
too
late
in
any
event
for
a
peace
message
to
do
any
good
the
cosmos
is
too
raveled
by
change
too
far
gone
it
will
dissolve
fade
not
a
rack
behind
we
the
survivors
the
torch
of
existence
has
been
put
in
our
hands
we
may
already
be
all
that
left
in
the
cosmos
for
have
you
thought
that
the
change
winds
may
have
died
at
their
source
we
may
never
reach
another
cosmos
we
may
drift
forever
in
the
void
but
who
of
us
has
been
introverted
before
and
who
knows
what
we
can
or
can
not
do
we
a
seed
for
a
new
future
to
grow
from
perhaps
all
doomed
universes
cast
off
seeds
like
this
place
it
a
seed
it
an
embryo
let
it
grow
she
looked
swiftly
at
bruce
and
then
at
sid
and
she
quoted
my
friends
is
not
too
late
to
seek
a
newer
world
i
squeezed
sid
hand
and
i
started
to
say
something
to
him
but
he
did
know
i
was
there
he
was
listening
to
lili
quote
tennyson
with
his
eyes
entranced
and
his
mouth
open
as
if
he
were
imagining
new
things
to
put
into
it
oh
siddy
and
then
i
saw
the
others
were
looking
at
her
the
same
way
ilhilihis
was
seeing
finer
feather
forests
than
luna
grow
the
greenhouse
child
maud
davies
was
stowing
away
on
a
starship
bound
for
another
galaxy
or
thinking
how
different
her
life
might
have
been
the
children
she
might
have
had
if
she
stayed
on
the
planets
and
out
of
the
change
world
even
erich
looked
as
though
he
might
be
blitzing
new
universes
and
mark
subduing
them
for
an
beau
was
throbbing
up
a
wider
mississippi
in
a
sidewheeler
even
i
well
i
was
dreaming
of
a
greater
chicago
let
not
go
on
this
sort
of
thing
i
told
myself
but
i
did
look
up
at
the
void
and
i
got
a
shiver
because
i
imagined
it
drawing
away
and
the
whole
place
starting
to
grow
i
truly
meant
what
i
said
about
a
seed
lili
went
on
slowly
i
know
as
you
all
do
that
there
are
no
children
in
the
change
world
that
there
can
not
be
that
we
all
become
instantly
sterile
that
what
they
call
a
curse
is
lifted
from
us
girls
and
we
are
no
longer
in
bondage
to
the
moon
she
was
right
all
right
if
there
one
thing
that
been
proved
a
million
times
in
the
change
world
it
that
but
we
are
no
longer
in
the
change
world
lili
said
softly
and
its
limitations
should
no
longer
apply
to
us
including
that
one
i
feel
deeply
certain
of
it
but
she
looked
around
slowly
we
are
four
women
here
and
i
thought
one
of
us
might
have
a
surer
indication
my
eyes
followed
hers
around
like
anybody
would
in
fact
everybody
was
looking
around
except
maud
and
she
had
the
silliest
look
of
surprise
on
her
face
and
it
stayed
there
and
then
very
carefully
she
got
down
from
the
bar
stool
with
her
knitting
she
looked
at
the
pink
bra
with
the
long
white
needles
stuck
in
it
and
her
eyes
bugged
bigger
yet
as
if
she
were
expecting
it
to
turn
into
a
baby
sweater
right
then
and
there
then
she
walked
across
the
place
to
lili
and
stood
beside
her
while
she
was
walking
the
look
of
surprise
changed
to
a
quiet
smile
the
only
other
thing
she
did
was
throw
her
shoulders
back
a
little
i
was
jealous
of
her
for
a
second
but
it
was
a
double
miracle
for
her
considering
her
age
and
i
could
grudge
her
that
and
to
tell
the
truth
i
was
a
little
frightened
too
even
with
dave
i
been
bothered
about
this
business
of
having
babies
yet
i
stood
up
with
siddy
i
could
stop
myself
and
i
guess
he
could
either
and
hand
in
hand
we
walked
to
the
control
divan
beau
and
sevensee
were
there
and
bruce
of
course
and
then
so
help
me
those
soldiers
to
the
death
kaby
and
mark
started
over
from
the
bar
and
i
could
see
anything
in
their
eyes
about
the
greater
glory
of
crete
and
rome
but
something
i
think
about
each
other
and
after
a
moment
illy
slowly
detached
himself
from
the
piano
and
followed
lightly
trailing
his
tentacles
on
the
floor
i
could
exactly
see
him
hoping
for
little
illies
in
this
company
unless
it
was
true
what
the
jokes
said
about
lunans
but
maybe
he
was
being
really
disinterested
and
maybe
he
was
maybe
he
was
simply
figuring
that
illy
ought
to
be
on
the
side
with
the
biggest
battalions
i
heard
dragging
footsteps
behind
us
and
here
came
doc
from
the
gallery
carrying
in
his
folded
arms
an
abstract
sculpture
as
big
as
a
newborn
baby
it
was
an
agglomeration
of
perfect
shiny
gray
spheres
the
size
of
golf
balls
shaping
up
to
something
like
a
large
brain
but
with
holes
showing
through
here
and
there
he
held
it
out
to
us
like
an
infant
to
be
admired
and
worked
his
lips
and
tongue
as
if
he
were
trying
very
hard
to
say
something
though
not
a
word
came
out
that
you
could
understand
and
i
thought
maxey
aleksevich
may
be
speechless
drunk
and
have
all
sorts
of
holes
in
his
head
but
he
got
the
right
instincts
bless
his
soulful
little
russian
heart
we
were
all
crowded
around
the
control
divan
like
a
football
team
huddling
the
peace
packers
it
came
to
me
sevensee
would
be
fullback
or
center
and
illy
left
end
what
a
receiver
the
right
number
too
erich
was
alone
at
the
bar
but
now
even
he
oh
no
this
ca
be
i
thought
even
he
came
toward
us
then
i
saw
that
his
face
was
working
the
worst
ever
he
stopped
halfway
and
managed
to
force
a
smile
but
it
was
the
worst
too
that
my
little
commandant
i
thought
no
team
spirit
so
now
lili
and
bruce
yes
and
maud
have
their
little
nest
he
said
and
he
would
have
had
to
push
his
voice
very
hard
to
get
a
screech
but
what
are
the
rest
of
us
supposed
to
be
cowbirds
he
crooked
his
neck
and
flapped
his
hands
and
croaked
and
i
said
to
myself
i
often
thought
you
were
crazy
boy
but
now
i
know
yes
devil
dirt
but
you
all
seem
to
be
infected
with
this
dream
of
children
ca
you
see
that
the
change
world
is
the
natural
and
proper
end
of
evolution
a
period
of
enjoyment
and
measuring
an
ultimate
working
out
of
things
which
women
call
destruction
i
being
raped
what
are
they
doing
to
my
children
but
which
men
know
as
fulfillment
you
given
good
parts
in
and
you
go
up
to
the
author
and
tap
him
on
the
shoulder
and
say
me
herr
wagner
but
this
twilight
of
the
gods
is
just
a
bit
morbid
why
do
you
write
an
opera
for
me
about
the
little
ones
the
dear
little
a
plot
oh
boy
meets
girl
and
they
settle
down
to
breed
something
like
that
devil
dirt
doubled
and
damned
have
you
thought
what
life
will
be
like
without
a
door
to
go
out
of
to
find
freedom
and
adventure
to
measure
your
courage
and
keenness
do
you
want
to
grow
long
gray
beards
hobbling
around
this
asteroid
turned
inside
out
putter
around
indoors
to
the
end
of
your
days
mooning
about
little
baby
cosmoses
incidentally
with
a
live
bomb
for
company
the
cave
the
womb
the
little
gray
home
in
the
nest
is
that
what
you
want
grow
oh
yes
like
the
city
engulfing
the
wild
wood
a
proliferation
of
i
should
live
so
long
women
how
i
hate
their
bright
eyes
as
they
look
at
me
from
the
fireside
rocking
deeply
happy
to
be
old
and
say
getting
weak
he
giving
out
soon
i
have
to
put
him
to
bed
and
do
the
simplest
things
for
him
your
filthy
triple
goddess
kaby
the
birther
bride
and
burier
of
man
woman
the
enfeebler
the
fetterer
the
crippler
woman
and
the
little
cancers
she
wants
he
lurched
toward
us
pointing
at
lili
i
never
knew
one
who
want
to
cripple
a
man
if
you
gave
her
the
chance
cripple
him
swaddle
him
clip
his
wings
grind
him
to
sausage
to
mold
another
man
hers
a
doll
man
you
hid
the
maintainer
you
little
so
you
could
have
your
nest
and
your
brucie
he
stopped
gasping
and
i
expected
someone
to
bop
him
one
on
the
schnozzle
and
i
think
he
did
too
i
turned
to
bruce
and
he
was
looking
i
do
know
how
sorry
guilty
anxious
angry
shaken
inspired
all
at
once
and
i
wished
people
sometimes
had
simple
suburban
reactions
like
magazine
stories
then
erich
made
the
mistake
if
it
was
one
of
turning
toward
bruce
and
slowly
staggering
toward
him
pawing
the
air
with
his
hands
as
if
he
were
going
to
collapse
into
his
arms
and
saying
do
let
them
get
you
bruce
do
let
them
tie
you
down
do
let
them
clip
you
your
words
or
your
deeds
you
a
soldier
even
when
you
talked
about
a
peace
message
you
talked
about
doing
some
smashing
of
your
own
no
matter
what
you
think
and
feel
bruce
no
matter
how
much
lying
you
do
and
how
much
you
hide
you
really
not
on
their
side
that
did
it
it
did
come
soon
enough
or
i
think
in
the
right
spirit
to
please
me
but
i
will
say
it
for
bruce
that
he
did
muck
it
up
by
tipping
or
softening
his
punch
he
took
one
step
forward
and
his
shoulders
spun
and
his
fist
connected
sweet
and
clean
as
he
did
it
he
said
only
one
word
loki
and
darn
if
that
switch
me
back
to
a
campfire
in
the
indiana
dunes
and
my
mother
telling
me
out
of
the
elder
saga
about
the
malicious
sneering
norse
god
and
how
when
the
other
gods
came
to
trap
him
in
his
hideaway
by
the
river
he
was
on
the
point
of
finishing
knotting
a
mysterious
net
big
enough
i
had
imagined
to
snare
the
whole
universe
and
that
if
they
come
a
minute
later
he
would
have
erich
was
stretched
on
the
floor
his
head
hitched
up
rubbing
his
jaw
and
glaring
at
bruce
mark
who
was
standing
beside
me
moved
a
little
and
i
thought
he
was
going
to
do
something
maybe
even
clobber
bruce
in
the
old
spirit
of
you
ca
do
that
to
my
buddy
but
he
just
shook
his
head
and
said
vincit
i
nudged
him
and
said
meaning
and
he
said
love
licks
everything
i
never
have
expected
it
from
a
roman
but
he
was
half
right
at
any
rate
lili
had
her
victory
bruce
clearing
the
field
for
the
marriage
by
laying
out
the
boy
friend
who
would
be
trying
to
get
him
to
go
out
nights
at
that
moment
i
think
bruce
wanted
lili
and
a
life
with
her
more
than
he
wanted
to
reform
the
change
world
sure
us
women
have
our
little
victories
until
the
legions
come
or
the
little
corporal
draws
up
his
artillery
or
the
panzers
roar
down
the
road
erich
scrambled
to
his
feet
and
stood
there
in
a
still
rubbing
his
jaw
and
glaring
at
bruce
over
his
hand
but
making
no
move
to
continue
the
fight
and
i
studied
his
face
and
said
to
myself
if
he
can
get
a
gun
he
going
to
shoot
himself
i
know
bruce
started
to
say
something
and
hesitated
like
i
would
have
in
his
shoes
and
just
then
doc
got
one
of
his
unpredictable
inspirations
and
went
weaving
out
toward
erich
holding
out
the
sculpture
and
making
noises
like
he
had
to
us
erich
looked
at
him
as
if
he
were
going
to
kill
him
and
then
grabbed
the
sculpture
and
swung
it
up
over
his
head
and
smashed
it
down
on
the
floor
and
for
a
wonder
it
did
shatter
it
just
skidded
along
in
one
piece
and
stopped
inches
from
my
feet
that
thing
not
breaking
must
have
been
the
last
straw
for
erich
i
swear
i
could
see
the
red
surge
up
through
his
eyes
toward
his
brain
he
swung
around
into
the
stores
sector
and
ran
the
few
steps
between
him
and
the
bronze
bomb
chest
everything
got
very
slow
motion
for
me
though
i
did
do
any
moving
almost
every
man
started
out
after
erich
bruce
did
though
and
siddy
turned
back
after
the
first
surge
forward
while
illy
squunched
down
for
a
leap
and
it
was
between
sevensee
hairy
shanks
and
scissoring
white
pants
that
i
saw
that
circle
of
death
heads
and
watched
erich
finger
go
down
on
them
in
the
order
kaby
had
given
one
three
five
six
two
four
seven
i
was
able
to
pray
seven
distinct
times
that
he
make
a
mistake
he
straightened
up
illy
landed
by
the
box
like
a
huge
silver
spider
and
his
tentacles
whipped
futilely
across
its
top
the
others
surged
to
a
frightened
halt
around
them
erich
chest
was
heaving
but
his
voice
was
cool
and
collected
as
he
said
you
mentioned
something
about
our
having
a
future
miss
foster
now
you
can
make
that
more
specific
unless
we
get
back
to
the
cosmos
and
dump
this
box
or
find
a
spider
or
manage
to
call
headquarters
for
guidance
on
disarming
the
bomb
we
have
a
future
exactly
thirty
minutes
long
chapter
but
whence
he
was
or
of
what
wombe
ybore
of
beasts
or
of
the
earth
i
have
not
red
but
certes
was
with
milke
of
wolves
and
tygres
fed
spenser
the
tiger
is
loose
i
guess
when
they
really
push
the
button
or
throw
the
switch
or
spring
the
trap
or
focus
the
beam
or
what
have
you
you
do
faint
or
go
crazy
or
anything
else
convenient
i
did
everything
everybody
every
move
that
was
made
every
word
that
was
spoken
was
painfully
real
to
me
like
a
hand
twisting
and
squeezing
things
deep
inside
me
and
i
saw
every
least
detail
spotlighted
and
magnified
like
i
had
the
seven
skulls
erich
was
standing
beyond
the
bomb
chest
little
smiles
were
ruffling
his
lips
i
never
seen
him
look
so
sharp
illy
was
beside
him
but
not
on
his
side
you
understand
mark
sevensee
and
beau
were
around
the
chest
to
the
nearer
side
beau
had
dropped
to
a
knee
and
was
scanning
the
chest
minutely
making
him
bend
his
head
a
little
closer
than
he
needed
to
for
clear
vision
but
with
his
hands
locked
together
behind
his
back
i
guess
to
restrain
the
impulse
to
push
any
and
everything
that
looked
like
a
disarming
button
doc
was
sprawled
face
down
on
the
nearest
couch
out
like
a
light
i
suppose
us
four
girls
were
still
by
the
control
divan
with
kaby
that
surprised
me
because
she
did
look
scared
or
frozen
but
almost
as
intensely
alive
as
erich
sid
had
turned
back
as
i
said
and
had
one
hand
stretched
out
toward
but
not
touching
the
minor
maintainer
and
a
look
on
his
beardy
face
as
if
he
were
calling
down
death
and
destruction
on
every
boozy
rogue
who
had
ever
gone
up
from
king
lynn
to
cambridge
and
london
and
i
realized
why
if
he
thought
of
the
minor
maintainer
a
second
sooner
he
could
have
pinned
erich
down
with
heavy
gravity
before
he
could
touch
the
buttons
bruce
was
resting
one
hand
on
the
head
of
the
control
divan
and
was
looking
toward
the
group
around
the
chest
toward
erich
i
think
as
if
erich
had
done
something
rather
wonderful
for
him
though
i
imagine
myself
being
tickled
at
being
included
in
anybody
suicide
surprise
party
bruce
looked
altogether
too
dreamy
brahma
blast
him
for
someone
who
must
have
the
same
thought
in
his
head
that
i
know
darn
well
the
rest
of
us
had
that
in
minutes
or
so
the
place
would
be
a
sun
in
a
bag
erich
was
the
first
to
get
down
to
business
as
i
have
laid
any
odds
he
would
be
he
had
the
jump
on
us
and
he
was
going
to
lose
it
well
when
are
you
going
to
start
getting
lili
to
tell
us
where
she
hid
the
maintainer
it
has
to
be
her
she
was
too
certain
it
was
gone
forever
when
she
talked
and
bruce
must
have
seen
from
the
bar
who
took
the
maintainer
and
who
would
he
cover
up
for
but
his
girl
there
he
was
plagiarizing
my
ideas
but
i
guess
i
was
willing
to
sign
them
over
to
him
in
full
if
he
got
us
the
right
pail
of
water
for
that
he
glanced
at
his
wrist
according
to
my
caller
you
have
and
a
half
minutes
including
the
time
it
will
take
to
get
a
door
or
contact
headquarters
when
are
you
going
to
get
busy
on
the
girl
bruce
laughed
a
little
deprecatingly
so
help
me
and
started
toward
him
look
here
old
man
he
said
there
no
need
to
trouble
lili
or
to
fuss
with
headquarters
even
if
you
could
really
not
at
all
not
to
mention
that
your
surmises
are
quite
unfounded
old
chap
and
i
a
bit
surprised
at
your
advancing
them
but
that
quite
all
right
because
as
it
happens
i
an
atomics
technician
and
i
even
worked
on
that
very
bomb
to
disarm
it
you
just
have
to
fiddle
a
bit
with
some
of
the
ankhs
those
hoopy
little
crosses
here
let
me
allah
il
allah
but
it
must
have
struck
everybody
as
it
did
me
as
being
just
too
incredible
an
assertion
too
bloody
british
a
bluff
for
erich
did
have
to
say
a
word
mark
and
sevensee
grabbed
bruce
by
the
arms
one
on
each
side
as
he
stooped
toward
the
bronze
chest
and
they
were
gentle
about
it
then
erich
spoke
oh
no
bruce
very
sporting
of
you
to
try
to
cover
up
for
your
girl
friend
but
we
are
going
to
let
ourselves
be
blown
to
stripped
atoms
minutes
too
soon
while
you
monkey
with
the
buttons
the
very
thing
warned
against
and
pray
for
a
guesswork
miracle
it
too
thin
bruce
when
you
come
from
and
have
been
on
the
big
time
for
a
hundred
sleeps
and
were
calling
for
an
yourself
a
few
hours
ago
much
too
thin
bruce
something
is
going
to
happen
that
i
afraid
you
wo
like
but
you
going
to
have
to
put
up
with
it
that
is
unless
miss
foster
decides
to
be
cooperative
i
say
you
fellows
let
me
go
bruce
demanded
struggling
experimentally
i
know
it
a
bit
thick
to
swallow
and
i
did
give
you
the
wrong
impression
calling
for
an
but
i
just
wanted
to
capture
your
attention
then
i
did
want
to
have
to
work
on
the
bomb
really
erich
would
they
have
ordered
to
pick
us
up
unless
one
of
us
were
an
they
be
sure
to
include
one
in
the
bally
operation
when
they
using
patchwork
tactics
erich
grinningly
quoted
back
at
him
kaby
spoke
up
beside
me
and
said
was
a
magician
of
matter
and
he
was
going
on
the
operation
disguised
as
an
old
woman
we
have
the
cloak
and
hood
with
the
other
garments
and
i
wondered
how
this
cold
fish
of
a
could
be
the
same
girl
who
was
giving
mark
slurpy
looks
not
ten
minutes
ago
well
erich
asked
glancing
at
his
caller
and
then
swinging
his
eyes
around
at
us
as
if
there
must
be
some
of
the
old
iron
somewhere
we
all
found
ourselves
looking
at
lili
and
she
was
looking
so
sharp
herself
so
ready
to
jump
and
so
at
bay
that
it
was
all
needed
at
any
rate
to
make
erich
theory
about
the
maintainer
a
certainty
bruce
must
have
realized
the
way
our
minds
were
working
for
he
started
to
struggle
in
earnest
and
at
the
same
time
called
for
god
sake
do
do
anything
to
lili
let
me
loose
you
idiots
everything
true
i
told
you
i
can
save
you
from
that
bomb
sevensee
you
took
my
side
against
the
spiders
you
nothing
to
lose
sid
you
an
englishman
beau
you
a
gentleman
and
you
love
her
too
for
god
sake
stop
them
beau
glanced
up
over
his
shoulder
at
bruce
and
the
others
surging
around
close
to
his
ankles
and
he
had
on
his
poker
face
sid
i
could
tell
was
once
more
going
through
the
purgatory
of
decision
beau
reached
his
own
decision
first
and
i
say
it
for
him
that
he
acted
on
it
fast
and
intelligently
right
from
his
kneeling
position
and
before
he
even
turned
his
head
quite
back
he
jumped
erich
but
other
things
in
this
cosmos
besides
man
can
pick
sides
and
act
fast
illy
landed
on
beau
midway
and
whipped
his
tentacles
around
him
tight
and
they
went
wobbling
around
like
a
drunken
barber
pole
beau
got
his
hands
each
around
a
tentacle
and
at
the
same
time
his
face
began
to
get
purple
and
i
winced
at
what
they
were
both
going
through
maybe
sevensee
had
a
hoof
in
sid
purgatory
because
bruce
shook
loose
from
the
satyr
and
tried
to
knock
out
mark
but
the
roman
twisted
his
arm
and
kept
him
from
getting
in
a
good
punch
erich
did
make
a
move
to
mix
into
either
fight
which
is
my
little
commandant
all
over
using
his
fists
on
anybody
but
me
is
beneath
him
then
sid
made
his
choice
but
there
was
no
way
for
me
to
tell
what
it
was
for
as
he
reached
for
the
minor
maintainer
kaby
contemptuously
snatched
it
away
from
his
hands
and
gave
him
a
knee
in
the
belly
that
doubled
me
up
in
sympathy
and
sent
him
sprawling
on
his
knees
toward
the
fighters
on
the
return
kaby
gave
lili
who
started
to
grab
too
an
effortless
backhand
smash
that
set
her
down
on
the
divan
erich
face
lit
up
like
an
electric
sign
and
he
kept
his
eyes
fixed
on
kaby
she
crouched
a
little
carrying
her
weight
on
the
balls
of
her
feet
and
firmly
cradling
the
minor
maintainer
in
her
left
arm
like
a
basketball
captain
planning
an
offensive
then
she
waved
her
free
hand
decisively
to
the
right
i
did
get
it
but
erich
did
and
mark
too
for
erich
jumped
for
the
refresher
sector
and
mark
let
go
of
bruce
and
followed
him
ducking
around
sevensee
arms
who
was
coming
back
into
the
fight
on
which
side
i
do
know
illy
from
beau
and
copied
erich
and
mark
with
one
big
spring
then
kaby
twisted
a
dial
as
far
as
it
would
go
and
bruce
beau
sevensee
and
poor
siddy
were
slammed
down
and
pinned
to
the
floor
by
about
eight
gravities
it
should
have
been
lighter
near
us
i
hoped
it
was
but
you
tell
from
watching
siddy
he
went
flat
on
his
face
one
hand
stretched
toward
me
so
close
i
could
have
touched
it
but
not
let
go
and
his
mouth
was
open
against
the
floor
and
he
was
gasping
through
a
corner
of
it
and
i
could
see
his
spine
trying
to
sink
through
his
belly
bruce
just
managed
to
get
his
head
and
one
shoulder
up
a
bit
and
they
all
made
me
think
of
a
dore
illustration
of
the
where
the
cream
of
the
damned
are
frozen
up
to
their
necks
in
ice
in
the
innermost
circle
of
hell
the
gravity
did
catch
me
although
i
could
feel
it
in
my
left
arm
i
was
mostly
in
the
refresher
sector
but
i
dropped
down
flat
too
partly
out
of
a
crazy
compassion
i
have
but
mostly
because
i
did
want
to
take
a
chance
of
having
kaby
knock
me
down
erich
mark
and
illy
had
got
clear
and
they
headed
toward
us
maud
picked
the
moment
to
make
her
play
she
had
much
choice
of
times
if
she
wanted
to
make
one
the
old
girl
was
looking
it
for
once
but
i
guess
the
thought
of
her
miracle
must
have
survived
alongside
the
fear
of
sacked
sun
and
must
have
meant
a
lot
to
her
for
she
launched
out
fast
all
set
to
kaby
into
the
heavy
gravity
and
grab
the
minor
maintainer
with
the
other
hand
chapter
like
diamonds
we
are
cut
with
our
own
dust
webster
now
will
you
talk
cretans
have
eyes
under
their
back
hair
or
let
face
it
entertainers
are
soldiers
kaby
weaved
to
one
side
and
flicked
a
helpful
hand
and
poor
old
maud
went
where
she
been
going
to
send
kaby
it
sickened
me
to
see
the
gravity
take
hold
and
yank
her
down
i
could
have
jumped
up
and
made
it
four
in
a
row
for
kaby
but
i
not
a
bit
brave
when
things
like
my
life
are
at
stake
lili
was
starting
to
get
up
acting
a
little
dazed
kaby
gently
pushed
her
down
again
and
quietly
said
where
is
it
and
then
hauled
off
and
slapped
her
across
the
face
what
got
me
was
the
way
kaby
did
it
i
can
understand
somebody
getting
mad
and
socking
someone
or
even
deliberately
working
up
a
rage
so
as
to
be
able
to
do
something
nasty
but
this
way
turns
my
stomach
lili
looked
as
if
half
her
face
were
about
to
start
bleeding
but
she
did
look
dazed
any
more
and
her
jaw
set
kaby
grabbed
lili
pearl
necklace
and
twisted
it
around
her
neck
and
it
broke
and
the
pearls
went
bouncing
around
like
balls
so
kaby
yanked
down
lili
gray
silk
bandeau
until
it
was
around
the
neck
and
tightened
that
lili
started
to
choke
through
her
lips
erich
mark
and
illy
had
come
up
and
crowded
around
but
they
seemed
to
be
content
with
the
job
kaby
was
doing
listen
slut
she
said
we
have
no
time
you
have
a
healing
room
in
this
place
i
can
work
the
things
here
it
comes
i
thought
wishing
i
could
faint
on
top
of
everything
on
top
of
death
even
they
had
to
drag
in
the
nightmare
personally
stylized
for
me
the
horror
with
my
name
on
it
i
was
going
to
be
allowed
to
blow
up
peacefully
they
were
satisfied
with
an
they
had
to
write
my
private
hell
into
the
script
there
is
a
thing
called
an
invertor
kaby
said
exactly
as
i
known
she
would
but
as
i
did
really
hear
it
just
then
a
mental
split
explain
in
a
moment
it
opens
you
up
so
they
can
cure
your
insides
without
cutting
your
skin
or
making
you
bleed
anywhere
it
turns
the
big
parts
of
you
inside
out
but
not
the
blood
tubes
all
your
skin
your
eyes
ears
nose
toes
all
of
it
becoming
the
lining
of
a
little
hole
that
with
your
hair
meantime
your
insides
are
exposed
for
whatever
the
healer
wants
to
do
to
them
you
live
for
a
while
on
the
air
inside
the
hole
first
the
healer
gives
you
an
air
that
makes
you
sleep
or
you
go
mad
in
about
fifty
heartbeats
we
see
what
ten
heartbeats
do
to
you
without
the
sleepy
air
now
will
you
talk
i
had
been
listening
to
her
though
not
the
real
me
or
i
have
gone
mad
without
getting
the
treatment
i
once
heard
doc
say
your
liver
is
more
mysterious
and
farther
away
from
you
than
the
stars
because
although
you
live
with
your
liver
all
your
life
you
never
see
it
or
learn
to
point
to
it
instinctively
and
the
thought
of
someone
messing
around
with
that
intimate
yet
unknown
part
of
you
is
just
too
awful
i
knew
i
had
to
do
something
quick
hell
at
the
first
hint
of
introversion
before
kaby
had
even
named
it
illy
had
winced
so
that
his
tentacles
were
all
drawn
up
like
fat
erich
had
looked
at
him
questioningly
but
that
lousy
looney
had
himself
to
me
by
squeaking
do
mind
me
i
just
sensitive
get
on
with
the
girl
make
her
tell
yes
i
knew
i
had
to
do
something
and
here
on
the
floor
that
meant
thinking
hard
and
in
high
gear
about
something
else
the
screwball
sculpture
erich
had
tried
to
smash
was
a
foot
from
my
nose
and
i
saw
a
faint
trail
of
white
stuff
where
it
had
skidded
i
reached
out
and
touched
the
trail
it
was
finely
gritty
like
powdered
glass
i
tipped
up
the
sculpture
and
the
part
on
which
it
had
skidded
was
marred
at
all
not
even
dulled
the
gray
spheres
were
as
glisteningly
bright
as
ever
so
i
knew
the
trail
was
diamond
dust
rubbed
off
the
diamonds
in
the
floor
by
something
even
harder
that
told
me
the
sculpture
was
something
special
and
maybe
doc
had
had
a
real
idea
in
his
pickled
brain
when
he
been
pushing
the
thing
at
all
of
us
and
trying
to
tell
us
something
he
had
managed
to
say
anything
then
but
he
had
earlier
when
he
been
going
to
tell
us
what
to
do
about
the
bomb
and
maybe
there
was
a
connection
i
twisted
my
memory
hard
and
let
it
spring
back
and
i
got
inversh
bosh
bosh
indeed
bosh
and
inverse
bosh
to
all
boozers
russki
or
otherwise
so
i
quick
tried
the
memory
trick
again
and
this
time
i
got
glovsh
and
then
i
grasped
and
almost
sneezed
on
diamond
dust
as
i
watched
the
pieces
fit
themselves
together
in
my
mind
like
a
movie
reel
it
all
hung
on
that
black
hussar
glove
lili
had
produced
for
bruce
only
she
could
have
found
it
in
stores
because
searched
every
fractional
pigeonhole
later
on
and
there
had
been
any
gloves
there
not
even
the
mate
there
would
have
been
also
bruce
had
had
two
gloves
to
start
with
and
we
had
been
through
the
whole
place
with
a
comb
and
there
had
been
only
the
two
black
gloves
on
the
floor
where
bruce
had
kicked
them
off
the
bar
those
two
and
those
two
only
the
glove
he
brought
from
outside
and
the
glove
lili
had
produced
for
him
so
a
glove
had
disappeared
the
last
i
seen
of
it
lili
had
been
putting
it
on
her
tray
and
a
glove
had
appeared
which
could
only
add
up
to
one
thing
lili
had
turned
the
glove
into
an
identical
right
she
could
have
done
it
by
turning
it
inside
out
the
ordinary
way
because
the
lining
was
different
but
as
i
knew
only
too
sickeningly
well
there
was
an
extraordinary
way
to
turn
things
inside
out
things
like
human
beings
you
merely
had
to
put
them
on
the
invertor
in
surgery
and
flick
the
switch
for
full
inversion
or
you
could
flick
it
for
partial
inversion
and
turn
something
into
a
perfect
mirror
image
of
itself
just
what
a
glove
is
of
a
left
rotation
through
the
fourth
dimension
the
science
boys
call
it
i
heard
of
it
being
used
in
surgery
on
the
highly
asymmetric
martians
and
even
to
give
a
socially
impeccable
right
hand
to
a
man
who
lost
one
by
turning
an
amputated
right
arm
into
an
amputated
left
ordinarily
nothing
but
live
things
are
ever
inverted
in
surgery
and
you
would
think
of
doing
it
to
an
inanimate
object
especially
in
a
place
where
the
doc
a
drunk
and
the
surgery
has
been
used
for
hundreds
of
sleeps
but
when
you
just
fallen
in
love
you
think
of
wonderful
crazy
things
to
do
for
people
drunk
with
love
lili
had
taken
bruce
extra
glove
into
surgery
partially
inverted
it
and
got
a
glove
to
give
him
what
doc
had
been
trying
to
say
with
his
inversh
bosh
was
invert
the
box
meaning
we
should
put
the
bronze
chest
through
full
inversion
to
get
at
the
bomb
inside
to
disarm
it
doc
too
had
got
the
idea
from
lili
trick
with
the
glove
what
an
tactical
atomic
bomb
would
look
like
i
could
not
imagine
and
did
not
particularly
care
to
see
i
might
have
to
though
i
realized
but
the
film
was
still
running
in
my
head
later
on
lili
had
decided
like
i
had
that
her
lover
was
going
to
lose
out
in
his
plea
for
mutiny
unless
she
could
give
him
a
really
captive
audience
and
maybe
even
then
she
had
been
figuring
on
creating
the
nest
for
chicks
and
all
those
other
things
we
believed
in
for
a
while
so
she
taken
the
major
maintainer
and
remembered
the
glove
and
not
many
seconds
later
she
had
set
down
on
a
shelf
of
the
art
gallery
an
object
that
no
one
would
think
of
questioning
except
someone
who
knew
the
gallery
by
heart
i
looked
at
the
abstract
sculpture
a
foot
from
my
nose
at
the
clustered
gray
spheres
the
size
of
golf
balls
i
had
known
that
the
inside
of
the
maintainer
was
made
up
of
vastly
tough
vastly
hard
giant
molecules
but
i
had
realized
they
were
quite
big
i
said
to
myself
greta
this
is
going
to
give
you
a
major
psychosis
but
you
the
one
who
has
to
do
it
because
no
one
is
going
to
listen
to
your
deductions
when
they
all
practically
living
on
negative
time
already
i
got
up
as
quietly
as
if
i
were
getting
out
of
a
bed
i
should
have
been
in
there
are
some
things
entertainers
are
good
at
and
kaby
was
just
saying
you
go
mad
in
about
fifty
heartbeats
everybody
on
their
feet
was
looking
at
lili
sid
seemed
to
have
moved
but
i
had
no
time
for
him
except
to
hope
he
had
done
anything
that
might
attract
attention
to
me
i
stepped
out
of
my
shoes
and
walked
rapidly
to
surgery
there
one
good
thing
about
this
hardest
floor
anywhere
it
does
creak
i
walked
through
the
surgery
screen
that
is
like
a
wall
of
opaque
odorless
cigarette
smoke
and
i
concentrated
on
remembering
my
snafued
training
and
before
i
had
time
to
panic
i
had
the
sculpture
positioned
on
the
gleaming
table
of
the
invertor
i
froze
for
a
moment
when
i
reached
for
the
inversion
switch
thinking
of
the
other
time
and
trying
to
remember
what
it
had
been
that
bothered
me
so
much
about
an
brain
being
bigger
and
not
having
eyes
but
then
i
either
thumbed
my
nose
at
my
nightmare
or
kissed
my
sanity
i
do
know
which
and
twisted
the
switch
all
the
way
over
and
there
was
the
major
maintainer
winking
blue
about
three
times
a
second
as
nice
as
you
could
want
it
it
must
have
been
working
as
sweet
and
steady
as
ever
all
the
time
it
was
inverted
except
that
being
inside
out
it
had
hocused
the
direction
finders
chapter
black
legged
spiders
with
red
hearts
of
hell
marquis
lord
spider
jesu
i
turned
and
sid
face
was
sticking
through
the
screen
like
a
tinted
hanging
on
a
gray
wall
and
i
got
the
impression
he
had
peered
unexpectedly
through
a
slit
in
an
arras
into
queen
bedroom
he
did
have
any
time
to
linger
on
the
sensation
even
if
he
wanted
to
for
an
elbow
with
a
copper
band
thrust
through
the
screen
and
dug
his
ribs
and
kaby
marched
lili
in
by
the
neck
erich
mark
and
illy
were
right
behind
they
caught
the
blue
flashes
and
stopped
dead
staring
at
the
erich
spared
me
one
look
which
seemed
to
say
so
you
did
it
not
that
it
matters
then
he
stepped
forward
and
picked
it
up
and
held
it
solidly
to
his
left
side
in
the
double
made
by
fingers
forearm
and
chest
and
reached
for
the
introversion
switch
with
a
look
on
his
face
as
if
he
were
opening
a
fifth
of
whisky
the
blue
light
died
and
change
winds
hit
me
like
a
stiff
drink
that
had
been
a
long
long
time
in
coming
like
a
hot
trumpet
note
out
of
nowhere
i
felt
the
changing
pasts
blowing
through
me
and
the
uncertainties
whistling
past
and
reality
softening
with
all
its
duties
and
necessities
and
the
little
memories
shredding
away
and
dancing
off
like
autumn
leaves
leaving
maybe
not
even
ghosts
behind
and
all
the
crazy
moods
like
mardi
gras
dancers
pouring
down
an
evening
street
and
something
inside
me
had
the
nerve
to
say
it
did
care
whether
greta
forzane
death
was
riding
in
those
winds
because
they
felt
so
good
i
could
tell
it
was
hitting
the
others
the
same
way
even
battered
lili
seemed
to
be
saying
you
making
me
drink
the
stuff
and
i
hate
you
for
it
but
i
do
love
it
i
guess
we
all
had
the
worry
that
even
finding
and
extroverting
the
maintainer
would
put
us
back
in
touch
with
the
cosmos
and
give
us
those
winds
we
hate
and
love
the
thing
that
cut
through
to
us
as
we
stood
there
glowing
was
not
the
thought
of
the
bomb
though
that
would
have
come
in
a
few
seconds
more
but
sid
voice
he
was
still
standing
in
the
screen
except
that
now
his
face
was
out
the
other
side
and
we
could
just
see
parts
of
his
back
but
of
course
his
jesu
came
through
the
screen
as
if
it
were
there
at
first
i
could
figure
out
who
he
could
be
talking
to
but
i
swear
i
never
heard
his
voice
so
courtly
obsequious
before
so
strong
and
yet
so
filled
with
awe
and
an
of
yes
sheer
terror
lord
i
am
filled
from
top
to
toe
with
confusion
that
you
should
so
honor
my
poor
place
he
said
poor
say
i
and
mine
when
i
mean
that
i
have
ever
busked
it
faithfully
for
you
not
dreaming
that
you
would
ever
condescend
yet
knowing
that
your
eye
was
certes
ever
upon
me
though
i
am
but
as
a
poor
pinch
of
dust
adrift
between
the
suns
i
abase
myself
prithee
how
may
i
serve
thee
sir
i
know
not
how
most
suitably
to
address
thee
lord
king
emperor
spider
i
felt
like
i
was
getting
very
small
but
not
a
bit
less
visible
worse
luck
and
even
with
the
change
winds
inside
me
to
give
me
courage
i
thought
this
was
really
too
much
coming
on
top
of
everything
else
it
was
simply
unfair
at
the
same
time
i
realized
it
was
to
be
expected
that
the
big
bosses
would
have
been
watching
us
with
their
unblinking
beady
black
eyes
ever
since
we
had
introverted
waiting
to
pounce
if
we
should
ever
come
out
of
it
i
tried
to
picture
what
was
on
the
other
side
of
the
screen
and
i
did
like
the
assignment
but
in
spite
of
being
petrified
i
had
a
hard
time
not
giggling
like
the
zany
at
graduation
exercises
at
the
way
the
other
ones
in
surgery
were
taking
it
i
mean
the
soldiers
they
each
stiffened
up
like
they
had
the
old
ramrod
inside
them
and
their
faces
got
that
important
look
and
they
glanced
at
each
other
and
the
floor
without
lowering
their
heads
as
if
they
were
measuring
the
distance
between
their
feet
and
mentally
chalking
alternate
sets
of
footprints
to
step
into
the
way
erich
and
kaby
held
the
major
and
minor
maintainers
became
formal
the
way
they
checked
their
callers
and
nodded
reassuringly
was
positively
esoteric
even
illy
somehow
managed
to
look
as
if
he
were
on
parade
then
from
beyond
the
screen
came
what
was
under
the
circumstances
the
worst
noise
i
ever
heard
a
seemingly
wordless
howling
and
wailing
with
a
note
of
menace
that
made
me
shake
although
it
also
had
a
nasty
familiarity
about
it
i
could
place
sid
voice
broke
into
it
loud
fast
and
frightened
your
pardon
lord
i
did
not
think
certes
the
gravity
attend
to
it
on
the
instant
he
whipped
a
hand
and
half
a
head
back
through
the
screen
but
without
looking
back
and
snapped
his
fingers
and
before
i
could
blink
kaby
had
put
the
minor
maintainer
in
his
hand
sid
went
completely
out
of
sight
then
and
the
howling
stopped
and
i
thought
that
if
that
was
the
way
a
lord
spider
expressed
his
annoyance
at
being
subjected
to
incorrect
gravity
i
hoped
the
bosses
start
any
conversations
with
me
erich
pursed
his
lips
and
threw
the
other
soldiers
a
nod
and
the
four
of
them
marched
through
the
screen
as
if
they
drilled
a
lifetime
for
this
moment
i
had
the
wild
idea
that
erich
might
give
me
his
arm
but
he
strode
past
me
as
if
i
were
an
entertainer
i
hesitated
a
moment
then
but
i
had
to
see
what
was
happening
outside
even
if
i
got
eaten
up
for
it
besides
i
had
a
bit
of
the
thought
that
if
these
formalities
went
on
much
longer
even
a
lord
spider
was
going
to
discover
just
how
immune
he
was
to
confined
atomic
blast
i
walked
through
the
screen
with
lili
beside
me
the
soldiers
had
stopped
a
few
feet
in
front
of
it
i
looked
around
ahead
for
whatever
it
was
going
to
turn
out
to
be
prepared
to
drop
a
curtsy
or
whatever
else
bar
nothing
that
seemed
expected
of
me
i
had
a
hard
time
spotting
the
beast
some
of
the
others
seemed
to
be
having
trouble
too
i
saw
doc
weaving
around
foolishly
by
the
control
divan
and
bruce
and
beau
and
sevensee
and
maud
on
their
feet
beyond
it
and
i
wondered
whether
we
were
dealing
with
an
invisible
monster
ought
to
be
easy
enough
for
the
bosses
to
turn
a
simple
trick
like
invisibility
then
i
looked
sharply
left
where
everyone
else
even
doc
was
coming
to
look
into
the
door
sector
only
there
was
any
monster
there
or
even
a
door
but
just
siddy
holding
the
minor
maintainer
and
grinning
like
when
he
is
threatening
to
tickle
me
only
more
fiendishly
not
a
move
masters
he
cried
his
eyes
dancing
or
i
pin
the
pack
of
you
down
marry
and
amen
i
will
it
is
my
firm
purpose
to
see
the
place
blasted
before
i
let
this
instrument
out
of
my
hands
again
my
first
thought
was
but
siddy
is
a
real
actor
i
do
care
if
he
did
study
under
anyone
later
than
burbage
that
just
proves
how
good
burbage
is
sid
had
convinced
us
not
only
that
the
real
spiders
had
arrived
but
earlier
that
the
gravity
in
the
edge
of
stores
had
been
a
lot
heavier
than
it
actually
was
he
completely
fooled
all
those
soldiers
including
my
victorious
little
commandant
and
i
kind
of
filed
away
the
timing
of
that
business
of
reaching
out
the
hand
and
snapping
the
fingers
without
looking
it
was
so
good
beauregard
sid
called
get
to
the
major
maintainer
and
call
headquarters
but
do
come
through
door
marry
go
by
refresher
not
trust
a
single
demon
of
you
in
this
sector
with
me
until
much
more
has
been
shown
and
settled
siddy
you
wonderful
i
said
starting
toward
him
as
soon
as
i
got
the
maintainer
unsnarled
and
looked
around
and
saw
your
sweet
old
face
back
tricksy
trull
not
the
breadth
of
one
scarlet
toenail
nearer
me
you
queen
of
sleights
and
high
priestess
of
deception
he
bellowed
you
least
of
all
do
i
trust
why
you
hid
the
maintainer
i
know
not
but
later
you
discover
the
truth
to
me
or
i
have
your
gizzard
i
could
see
there
was
going
to
have
to
be
a
little
explaining
doc
touched
off
i
guess
by
sid
waving
his
hand
at
me
threw
back
his
head
and
let
off
one
of
those
shuddery
siberian
he
does
so
blamed
well
sid
waved
toward
him
sharply
and
he
shut
up
beaming
toothily
but
at
least
i
knew
who
was
responsible
for
the
spider
wail
of
displeasure
that
sid
had
either
called
for
or
more
likely
got
as
a
gift
of
the
gods
and
used
in
his
act
beau
came
circling
around
fast
and
erich
shoved
the
major
maintainer
into
his
hands
without
making
any
fuss
the
four
soldiers
were
looking
pretty
glum
after
losing
their
grand
review
beau
dumped
some
junk
off
one
of
the
art
gallery
sturdy
taborets
and
set
the
major
maintainer
on
it
carefully
but
fast
and
quickly
knelt
in
front
of
it
and
whipped
on
some
earphones
and
started
to
tune
the
way
he
did
it
snatched
away
from
me
my
inward
glory
at
my
big
inversion
brainwave
so
fast
i
might
never
have
had
it
and
there
was
nothing
in
my
mind
again
but
the
bronze
bomb
chest
i
wondered
if
i
should
suggest
inverting
the
thing
but
i
said
to
myself
greta
you
got
no
diploma
to
show
them
and
there
probably
is
time
to
try
two
things
anyway
then
erich
for
once
did
something
i
wanted
him
to
though
i
did
care
for
its
effect
on
my
nerves
by
looking
at
his
caller
and
saying
quietly
nine
minutes
to
go
if
place
time
and
cosmic
time
are
synching
beau
was
steady
as
a
rock
and
working
adjustments
so
fine
that
i
could
even
see
his
fingers
move
then
at
the
other
end
of
the
place
bruce
took
a
few
steps
toward
us
sevensee
and
maud
followed
a
bit
behind
him
i
remembered
bruce
was
another
of
our
nuts
with
a
private
program
for
blowing
up
the
place
sidney
he
called
and
then
when
he
got
sid
attention
remember
sidney
you
and
i
both
came
down
to
london
from
peterhouse
i
did
get
it
then
bruce
looked
toward
erich
with
a
challenge
and
toward
lili
as
if
he
were
asking
her
forgiveness
for
something
i
could
read
her
expression
the
bruises
were
blue
on
her
throat
and
her
cheek
was
puffy
then
bruce
once
more
shot
erich
that
look
of
challenge
and
he
spun
and
grabbed
sevensee
by
a
wrist
and
stuck
out
a
foot
even
are
too
sharp
about
infighting
i
guess
and
the
satyr
had
every
right
to
feel
at
least
as
confused
as
i
felt
and
sent
him
stumbling
into
maud
and
the
two
of
them
tumbled
to
the
floor
in
a
jumble
of
hairy
legs
and
frock
bruce
raced
to
the
bomb
chest
most
of
us
yelled
stop
him
sid
pin
him
down
or
something
like
that
i
know
i
did
because
i
was
suddenly
sure
that
he
been
asking
lili
pardon
for
blowing
the
two
of
them
up
and
all
the
rest
of
us
too
the
stinker
sid
had
been
watching
him
all
the
time
and
now
he
lifted
his
hand
to
the
minor
maintainer
but
then
he
did
touch
any
of
the
dials
just
watched
and
waited
and
i
thought
shaitan
shave
us
does
siddy
want
in
on
death
too
ai
he
satisfied
with
all
he
knows
about
life
bruce
had
knelt
and
was
twisting
some
things
on
the
front
of
the
chest
and
it
was
all
as
bright
as
if
he
were
under
a
bank
of
klieg
lights
and
i
was
telling
myself
i
would
know
anything
when
the
fireball
fired
and
not
believing
it
and
sevensee
and
maud
had
got
unscrambled
and
were
starting
for
bruce
and
the
rest
of
us
were
yelling
at
sid
except
that
erich
was
just
looking
at
bruce
very
happily
and
sid
was
still
not
doing
anything
and
it
was
unbearable
except
just
then
i
felt
the
little
arteries
start
to
burst
in
my
brain
like
a
string
of
and
the
old
aorta
pop
and
for
good
measure
a
couple
of
valves
come
unhinged
in
my
ticker
and
i
was
thinking
well
now
i
know
what
like
to
die
of
heart
failure
and
high
blood
pressure
and
having
a
last
quiet
smile
at
having
cheated
the
bomb
when
bruce
jumped
up
and
back
from
the
chest
that
does
it
he
announced
cheerily
she
as
safe
as
the
bank
of
england
sevensee
and
maud
stopped
themselves
just
short
of
knocking
him
down
and
i
said
to
myself
hey
let
get
a
move
on
i
thought
heart
attacks
were
fast
before
anyone
else
could
speak
beau
did
he
had
turned
around
from
the
major
maintainer
and
pulled
aside
one
of
the
earphones
i
got
headquarters
he
said
crisply
they
told
me
how
to
disarm
the
bomb
i
merely
said
i
thought
we
ought
to
know
what
did
you
do
sir
he
called
to
bruce
there
a
row
of
four
ankhs
just
below
the
lock
the
first
to
your
left
you
give
a
quarter
turn
to
the
right
the
second
a
quarter
turn
to
the
left
same
for
the
fourth
and
you
do
touch
the
third
that
is
it
sir
beau
confirmed
the
long
silence
was
too
much
for
me
i
guess
i
must
have
the
shortest
span
for
unspoken
relief
going
i
drew
some
nourishment
out
of
my
restored
arteries
into
my
brain
cells
and
yelled
siddy
i
know
i
a
tricksy
trull
and
the
high
vixen
of
all
foxes
but
what
the
hell
is
peterhouse
the
oldest
college
at
cambridge
he
told
me
rather
coolly
chapter
familiar
with
infinite
universe
sheafs
and
postulate
systems
the
notion
that
everything
is
possible
and
i
mean
everything
and
everything
has
happened
heinlein
the
an
hour
later
i
was
nursing
a
weak
highball
and
a
black
eye
in
the
darkness
on
the
couch
farthest
from
the
piano
half
watching
the
highlighted
party
going
on
around
it
and
the
bar
while
the
place
waited
for
rendezvous
with
egypt
and
the
battle
of
alexandria
sid
had
swept
all
our
outstanding
problems
into
one
big
bundle
and
since
his
hand
held
the
joker
of
the
minor
maintainer
he
had
settled
them
all
as
as
if
they
been
those
of
a
bunch
of
schoolkids
it
amounted
to
this
we
been
introverted
when
most
of
the
damning
things
had
happened
so
presumably
only
we
knew
about
them
and
we
were
all
in
so
deep
one
way
or
another
that
we
all
have
to
keep
quiet
to
protect
our
delicate
complexions
well
erich
triggering
the
bomb
did
balance
rather
neatly
incitement
to
mutiny
and
there
was
doc
drinking
while
everybody
who
had
declared
for
the
peace
message
had
something
to
hide
mark
and
kaby
i
felt
inclined
to
trust
anywhere
maud
for
sure
and
erich
in
this
particular
matter
damn
him
illy
i
did
feel
at
all
easy
about
but
i
told
myself
there
always
has
to
be
a
fly
in
the
ointment
a
darn
big
one
this
time
and
furry
sid
did
mention
his
own
dirty
linen
but
he
knew
we
knew
he
flopped
badly
as
boss
of
the
place
and
only
recouped
himself
by
that
flimflam
remembering
sid
trick
made
me
think
for
a
moment
about
the
real
spiders
just
before
i
snuck
out
of
surgery
i
had
a
vivid
picture
of
what
they
must
look
like
but
now
i
could
get
it
again
it
depressed
me
not
being
able
to
remember
oh
i
probably
just
imagined
i
had
a
picture
like
a
hophead
on
a
kick
me
ever
find
out
anything
about
the
spiders
except
for
nervous
notions
like
i
had
during
the
recent
fracas
what
a
laugh
the
funniest
thing
was
that
i
had
ended
up
the
person
sid
would
give
me
time
to
explain
how
i
deduced
what
had
happened
to
the
maintainer
and
even
when
lili
spoke
up
and
admitted
hiding
it
she
acted
so
bored
i
do
think
everybody
believed
her
although
she
did
spill
the
realistic
detail
that
she
had
used
partial
inversion
on
the
glove
she
just
turned
it
inside
out
to
make
it
a
right
and
then
done
a
full
inversion
to
get
the
lining
back
inside
i
tried
to
get
doc
to
confirm
that
he
reasoned
the
thing
out
the
same
way
i
had
but
he
said
he
had
been
blacked
out
the
whole
time
except
during
the
first
part
of
the
hunt
and
he
did
remember
having
any
bright
ideas
at
all
right
now
he
was
having
maud
explain
to
him
twice
in
detail
everything
that
had
happened
i
decided
that
it
was
going
to
take
a
little
more
work
before
my
reputation
as
a
great
detective
was
established
i
looked
over
the
edge
of
the
couch
and
just
made
out
in
the
gloom
one
of
bruce
black
gloves
it
must
have
been
kicked
there
i
fished
it
up
it
was
the
one
my
big
clue
and
was
i
sick
of
it
got
mittens
god
forbid
i
slung
it
away
and
like
a
lurking
octopus
illy
shot
up
a
tentacle
from
the
next
couch
where
i
had
known
he
was
resting
and
snatched
the
glove
like
it
was
a
morsel
of
underwater
garbage
these
ets
can
seem
pretty
shuddery
at
times
i
thought
of
what
a
louse
illy
had
been
and
about
sid
and
his
easy
suspicions
and
erich
and
my
black
eye
and
how
as
usual
i
got
left
alone
in
the
end
my
men
bruce
had
explained
about
being
an
like
a
lot
of
us
he
had
several
widely
different
jobs
during
his
first
weeks
in
the
change
world
and
one
of
them
had
been
as
secretary
to
a
group
of
the
minor
atomics
boys
from
the
days
i
gathered
also
absorbed
some
of
his
bothersome
ideas
from
them
i
had
quite
decided
yet
what
species
of
heroic
heel
he
belonged
to
but
he
was
thick
with
mark
and
erich
again
everybody
men
sid
did
have
to
argue
with
anybody
all
the
wild
compulsions
and
mighty
resolves
were
dead
now
anyway
until
they
had
a
good
long
rest
i
sure
could
use
one
myself
i
knew
the
party
at
the
piano
was
getting
wilder
lili
had
been
dancing
the
black
bottom
on
top
of
it
and
now
she
jumped
down
into
sid
and
sevensee
arms
taking
a
long
time
about
it
she
been
drinking
a
lot
and
her
little
gray
dress
looked
about
as
innocent
on
her
as
diapers
would
on
nell
gwyn
she
continued
her
dance
distributing
her
marks
of
favor
equally
between
sid
erich
and
the
satyr
beau
did
mind
a
bit
but
serenely
pounded
out
tonight
the
night
which
she
practically
shouted
to
him
not
two
minutes
ago
i
was
glad
to
be
out
of
the
party
who
can
compete
with
a
highly
experienced
utterly
disillusioned
really
throwing
herself
away
for
the
first
time
something
touched
my
hand
illy
had
stretched
a
tentacle
into
a
furry
wire
to
return
me
the
black
glove
although
he
ought
to
have
known
i
did
want
it
i
pushed
it
away
privately
calling
illy
a
moronic
tarantula
and
right
away
i
felt
a
little
guilty
what
right
had
i
to
be
critical
of
illy
would
my
own
character
have
shown
to
advantage
if
i
been
locked
in
with
eleven
octopoids
a
billion
years
away
for
that
matter
where
did
i
get
off
being
critical
of
anyone
still
i
was
glad
to
be
out
of
the
party
though
i
kept
on
watching
it
bruce
was
drinking
alone
at
the
bar
once
sid
had
gone
over
to
him
and
they
had
one
together
and
i
heard
bruce
reciting
from
rupert
brooke
those
deliberately
corny
lines
for
england
the
one
land
i
know
where
men
with
splendid
hearts
may
go
and
cambridgeshire
of
all
england
the
shire
for
men
who
understand
and
i
remembered
that
brooke
too
had
died
young
in
world
war
one
and
my
ideas
had
got
fuzzy
but
mostly
bruce
was
just
calmly
drinking
by
himself
every
once
in
a
while
lili
would
look
at
him
and
stop
dead
in
her
dancing
and
laugh
i
figured
out
this
business
as
well
as
i
cared
to
lili
had
wanted
the
nest
with
all
her
heart
and
nothing
else
would
ever
satisfy
her
and
now
she
go
to
hell
her
own
way
and
probably
die
of
bright
disease
for
a
third
time
in
the
change
world
bruce
wanted
the
nest
or
lili
as
much
as
he
wanted
the
change
world
and
the
chances
it
gave
for
soldierly
cavorting
and
poetic
drunks
lili
seed
was
his
idea
of
healing
the
cosmos
maybe
he
make
a
real
mutiny
some
day
but
more
likely
he
stick
to
epics
his
and
lili
infatuation
would
die
completely
no
matter
how
rancid
it
looked
right
now
the
angle
might
go
but
change
would
magnify
the
romance
angle
and
it
might
seem
to
them
like
a
big
thing
of
a
sort
if
they
met
again
erich
had
his
shaped
to
suit
him
who
had
the
guts
and
cleverness
to
disarm
the
bomb
he
had
the
guts
to
trigger
you
have
to
hand
it
to
erich
for
having
the
nerve
to
put
us
all
in
a
situation
where
we
have
to
find
the
maintainer
or
fry
but
i
do
know
anything
disgusting
enough
to
hand
to
him
i
had
tried
a
while
back
i
had
gone
up
behind
him
and
said
hey
my
wicked
little
commandant
forgotten
your
so
and
as
he
turned
i
clawed
my
nails
and
slammed
him
across
the
cheek
that
how
i
got
the
black
eye
maud
wanted
to
put
an
electronic
leech
on
it
but
i
took
the
old
handkerchief
in
ice
water
well
at
any
rate
erich
had
his
scratches
to
match
bruce
not
as
deep
but
four
of
them
and
i
told
myself
maybe
they
get
infected
i
had
washed
my
hands
since
the
hunt
not
that
erich
does
love
scars
mark
was
the
one
who
helped
me
up
after
erich
knocked
me
down
you
got
any
omnias
for
that
i
snapped
at
him
for
what
mark
asked
oh
for
everything
that
been
happening
to
us
i
told
him
disgustedly
he
seemed
to
actually
think
for
a
moment
and
then
he
said
mutantur
nihil
meaning
i
asked
him
he
said
all
things
change
but
nothing
is
really
lost
it
would
be
a
wonderful
philosophy
to
stand
with
against
the
change
winds
also
damn
silly
i
wondered
if
mark
really
believed
it
i
wished
i
could
sometimes
i
come
close
to
thinking
it
a
lot
of
baloney
trying
to
be
any
decent
kind
of
demon
even
a
good
entertainer
then
i
tell
myself
that
life
greta
you
got
to
love
through
it
somehow
but
there
are
times
when
some
of
these
cookies
are
not
too
easy
to
love
something
brushed
the
palm
of
my
hand
again
it
was
illy
tentacle
with
the
tendrils
of
the
tip
spread
out
like
a
little
bush
i
started
to
pull
my
hand
away
but
then
i
realized
the
loon
was
simply
lonely
i
surrendered
my
hand
to
the
patterned
gossamer
pressures
of
illustration
right
away
i
got
the
words
feeling
lonely
greta
girl
it
almost
floored
me
i
tell
you
here
i
was
understanding
which
i
just
did
and
i
was
understanding
it
in
english
which
make
sense
at
all
for
a
second
i
thought
illy
must
have
spoken
but
i
knew
he
had
and
for
a
couple
more
seconds
i
thought
he
was
working
telepathy
on
me
using
the
as
cues
then
i
tumbled
to
what
was
happening
he
was
playing
english
on
my
palm
like
on
the
keyboard
of
his
squeakbox
and
since
i
could
play
english
on
a
squeakbox
myself
my
mind
translated
automatically
realizing
this
almost
gave
my
mind
stage
fright
but
i
was
too
fagged
to
be
hocused
by
i
just
lay
back
and
let
the
thoughts
come
through
it
good
to
have
someone
talk
to
you
even
an
underweight
octopus
and
without
the
squeaks
illy
did
sound
so
silly
his
phrasing
was
soberer
feeling
sad
greta
girl
because
you
never
understand
happening
to
us
all
illy
asked
me
because
you
never
be
anything
but
a
shadow
fighting
shadows
and
trying
to
love
shadows
in
between
the
battles
it
time
you
understood
we
not
really
fighting
a
war
at
all
although
it
looks
that
way
but
going
through
a
kind
of
evolution
though
not
exactly
the
kind
erich
had
in
mind
your
terran
thought
has
a
word
for
it
and
a
theory
for
it
a
theory
that
recurs
on
many
worlds
it
about
the
four
orders
of
life
plants
animals
men
and
demons
plants
are
they
ca
move
through
space
or
time
but
they
can
clutch
energy
and
transform
it
animals
are
they
can
move
through
space
man
terran
or
et
lunan
or
is
a
he
has
memory
demons
are
the
fourth
order
of
evolution
they
can
make
all
of
what
might
be
part
of
what
is
and
that
is
their
evolutionary
function
resurrection
is
like
the
metamorphosis
of
a
caterpillar
into
a
butterfly
a
being
breaks
out
of
the
chrysalis
of
its
lifeline
into
life
the
leap
from
the
ripped
cocoon
of
an
unchanging
reality
is
like
the
first
animal
leap
when
he
ceases
to
be
a
plant
and
the
change
world
is
the
core
of
meaning
behind
the
many
myths
of
immortality
all
evolution
looks
like
a
war
at
first
octopoids
against
monopoids
mammals
against
reptiles
and
it
has
a
necessary
dialectic
there
must
be
the
thesis
we
call
it
snake
and
the
antithesis
spider
before
there
can
be
the
ultimate
synthesis
when
all
possibilities
are
fully
realized
in
one
ultimate
universe
the
change
war
is
the
blind
destruction
it
seems
remember
that
the
serpent
is
your
symbol
of
wisdom
and
the
spider
your
sign
for
patience
the
two
names
are
rightly
frightening
to
you
for
all
high
existence
is
a
mixture
of
horror
and
delight
and
do
be
surprised
greta
girl
at
the
range
of
my
words
and
thoughts
in
a
way
i
had
a
billion
years
to
study
terra
and
learn
her
languages
and
myths
who
are
the
real
spiders
and
snakes
meaning
who
were
the
first
who
was
adam
greta
girl
who
was
cain
who
were
eve
and
lilith
in
binding
all
possibility
the
demons
also
bind
the
mental
with
the
material
all
beings
live
inside
and
outside
all
minds
throughout
the
whole
cosmos
even
this
place
is
after
its
fashion
a
giant
brain
its
floor
is
the
brainpan
the
boundary
of
the
void
is
the
cortex
of
gray
matter
yes
even
the
major
and
minor
maintainers
are
analogues
of
the
pineal
and
pituitary
glands
which
in
some
form
sustain
all
nervous
systems
there
the
real
picture
greta
girl
the
faded
out
and
illy
tendril
tips
merged
into
a
soft
pad
on
which
i
fingered
thanks
daddy
longlegs
chewing
over
in
my
mind
what
illy
had
just
told
me
i
looked
back
at
the
gang
around
the
piano
the
party
seemed
to
be
breaking
up
at
least
some
of
them
were
chopping
away
at
it
sid
had
gone
to
the
control
divan
and
was
getting
set
to
tune
in
egypt
mark
and
kaby
were
there
with
him
all
bursting
with
eagerness
and
the
vision
of
tanks
on
ranks
of
mounted
zombie
bowmen
going
up
in
a
mushroom
cloud
i
thought
of
what
illy
had
told
me
and
i
managed
a
smile
seems
we
got
to
win
and
lose
all
the
battles
every
which
way
mark
had
just
put
on
his
parthian
costume
groaning
cheerfully
trousers
again
and
was
striding
around
under
a
hat
like
a
cone
and
with
the
sleeves
of
his
candys
flapping
over
his
hands
he
waved
a
short
sword
with
a
guard
at
bruce
and
erich
and
told
them
to
get
a
move
on
kaby
was
going
along
on
the
operation
wearing
the
disguise
intended
for
i
got
a
kick
out
of
knowing
she
was
going
to
have
to
cover
that
chest
and
hobble
bruce
and
erich
were
taking
orders
from
mark
just
yet
erich
went
over
and
said
something
to
bruce
at
the
bar
and
bruce
got
down
and
went
over
with
erich
to
the
piano
and
erich
tapped
beau
on
the
shoulder
and
leaned
over
and
said
something
to
him
and
beau
nodded
and
yanked
limehouse
blues
to
a
fast
close
and
started
another
piece
something
slow
and
nostalgic
erich
and
bruce
waved
to
mark
and
smiled
as
if
to
show
him
that
whether
he
came
over
and
stood
with
them
or
not
the
legate
and
the
lieutenant
and
the
commandant
were
very
much
together
and
while
sevensee
hugged
lili
with
a
simple
enthusiasm
that
made
me
wonder
why
i
wasted
so
much
imagination
on
genetic
treatments
for
him
erich
and
bruce
sang
the
legion
of
the
lost
ones
to
the
cohort
of
the
damned
to
our
brothers
in
the
tunnels
outside
time
sing
three
zombies
raised
from
death
and
and
commandos
of
the
spiders
here
to
crime
we
three
blind
mice
on
the
wrong
hush
hush
hush
we
lost
our
now
and
will
never
get
back
hush
hush
hush
change
commandos
out
on
the
spree
damned
through
all
possibility
ghostgirls
think
kindly
on
such
as
we
hush
hush
hush
while
they
were
singing
i
looked
down
at
my
charcoal
skirt
and
over
at
maud
and
lili
and
i
thought
three
gray
hustlers
for
three
black
hussars
that
our
speed
well
i
never
thought
of
myself
as
a
job
winning
all
the
races
i
would
feel
comfortable
that
way
come
to
think
of
it
we
got
to
lose
and
win
all
the
races
in
the
long
run
the
way
the
course
is
laid
out
i
fingered
to
illy
that
