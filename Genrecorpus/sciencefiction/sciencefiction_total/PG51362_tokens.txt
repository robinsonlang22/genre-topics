extensive

any

that
the

on

was

nothing
in
the
world
could
be
happier
and
mere
serene
than
a
man
who
loves
his
work
but
what
happens
when
it
loves
him
back
keep
your
nerve
peter
manners
told
himself
it
only
a
job
but
nerve
has
to
rest
on
a
sturdier
foundation
than
cash
reserves
just
above
zero
and
eviction
if
he
came
away
from
this
interview
still
unemployed
clay
at
the
association
of
professional
engineers
who
had
set
up
the
appointment
had
eased
peter
nervousness
by
admitting
i
know
what
in
hell
he
looking
for
he
turned
down
every
man
sent
him
the
interview
was
at
three
fifteen
minutes
to
go
coming
early
would
betray
overeagerness
peter
stood
in
front
of
the
lex
industries
plant
and
studied
it
to
kill
time
plain
featureless
concrete
walls
not
large
for
a
manufacturing
plant
it
took
a
scant
minute
to
exhaust
its
sightseeing
potential
if
he
walked
around
the
building
he
could
if
he
ambled
come
back
to
the
front
entrance
just
before
three
he
turned
the
corner
stopped
frowned
wondering
what
there
was
about
the
building
that
seemed
so
puzzling
it
could
not
have
been
plainer
more
ordinary
it
was
in
fact
he
only
gradually
realized
so
plain
and
ordinary
that
it
was
like
no
other
building
he
had
ever
seen
there
had
been
windows
at
the
front
there
were
none
at
the
side
and
none
at
the
rear
then
how
were
the
working
areas
lit
he
looked
for
the
electric
service
lines
and
found
them
at
one
of
the
rear
corners
they
jolted
him
the
distribution
transformers
were
ten
times
as
large
as
they
should
have
been
for
a
plant
this
size
something
else
was
wrong
peter
looked
for
minutes
before
he
found
out
what
it
was
factories
usually
have
large
side
doorways
for
employees
changing
shifts
this
building
had
one
small
office
entrance
facing
the
street
and
the
only
other
door
was
at
the
loading
bay
big
enough
to
handle
employee
traffic
but
four
feet
above
the
ground
without
any
stairs
it
could
be
used
only
by
trucks
backing
up
to
it
maybe
the
employees
entrance
was
on
the
third
side
it
was
staring
back
at
the
last
blank
wall
peter
suddenly
remembered
the
time
he
had
set
out
to
kill
he
looked
at
his
watch
and
gasped
at
a
run
set
to
the
door
he
almost
fell
on
his
face
the
door
had
opened
by
itself
he
stopped
and
looked
for
a
eye
but
a
soft
voice
said
through
a
loudspeaker
in
the
anteroom
wall
mr
manners
what
he
panted
who
you
mr
manners
the
voice
asked
he
nodded
then
realized
he
had
to
answer
aloud
if
there
was
a
microphone
around
but
the
soft
voice
said
follow
the
open
doors
down
the
hall
lexington
is
expecting
you
thanks
peter
said
and
a
door
at
one
side
of
the
anteroom
swung
open
for
him
he
went
through
it
with
his
composure
slipping
still
further
from
his
grip
this
was
no
way
to
go
into
an
interview
but
doors
kept
opening
before
and
shutting
after
him
until
only
one
was
left
and
the
last
of
his
calm
was
blasted
away
by
a
bellow
from
within
do
stand
out
there
like
a
jackass
either
come
in
or
go
away
peter
found
himself
leaping
obediently
toward
the
doorway
he
stopped
just
short
of
it
took
a
deep
breath
and
huffed
it
out
took
another
all
the
while
thinking
hold
on
now
you
in
no
shape
for
an
interview
and
it
not
your
fault
this
whole
setup
is
geared
to
unnerve
you
the
kindergarten
kid
called
in
to
see
the
principal
he
let
another
bellow
bounce
off
him
as
he
blew
out
the
second
breath
straightened
his
jacket
and
tie
and
walked
in
as
an
engineer
applying
for
a
position
should
mr
lexington
he
said
i
peter
manners
the
association
sit
down
said
the
man
at
the
desk
let
look
you
over
he
was
a
huge
man
behind
an
even
huger
desk
peter
took
a
chair
in
front
of
the
desk
and
let
himself
be
inspected
it
was
comfortable
he
did
some
looking
over
of
his
own
to
ease
the
tension
the
room
was
more
than
merely
large
carpeted
throughout
with
a
rich
rug
the
oversized
desk
and
massive
leather
chairs
heavy
patterned
drapes
ornately
framed
paintings
by
god
even
a
manteled
fireplace
and
bowls
with
flowers
made
him
feel
as
if
he
had
walked
down
a
hospital
corridor
into
hollywood
idea
of
an
office
his
eyes
eventually
had
to
move
to
lexington
and
they
were
daunted
for
another
instant
this
was
a
citadel
of
a
man
great
girders
of
frame
supporting
buttresses
of
muscle
with
a
vaulting
head
and
drawbridge
chin
and
a
steel
gaze
that
defied
any
attempt
to
storm
it
but
then
peter
came
out
of
his
momentary
flinch
and
there
was
an
age
to
the
man
about
and
he
saw
the
muscles
had
turned
to
fat
the
complexion
ashen
the
eyes
set
deep
as
though
retreating
from
pain
and
this
was
a
citadel
of
a
man
yes
but
beginning
to
crumble
what
can
you
do
asked
lexington
abruptly
peter
started
opened
his
mouth
to
answer
closed
it
again
he
been
jolted
too
often
in
too
short
a
time
to
be
stampeded
into
blurting
a
reply
that
would
cost
him
this
job
good
said
lexington
only
a
fool
would
try
to
answer
that
do
you
have
any
knowledge
of
medicine
not
enough
to
matter
peter
said
stung
by
the
compliment
i
do
mean
how
to
bandage
a
cut
or
splint
a
broken
arm
i
mean
things
like
cell
structure
neural
communication
the
of
how
we
live
i
applying
for
a
job
as
engineer
i
know
are
you
interested
in
the
basics
of
how
we
live
peter
looked
for
a
hidden
trap
found
none
of
course
is
everyone
less
than
you
think
lexington
said
it
the
preconceived
notions
they
interested
in
protecting
at
least
i
wo
have
to
beat
them
out
of
you
thanks
said
peter
and
waited
for
the
next
fast
ball
how
long
have
you
been
out
of
school
only
two
years
but
you
knew
that
from
the
association
no
practical
experience
to
speak
of
some
said
peter
stung
again
this
time
not
by
a
compliment
after
i
got
my
degree
i
went
east
for
a
training
program
with
an
electrical
manufacturer
i
got
quite
a
bit
of
experience
there
the
company
stockpiled
you
lexington
said
peter
blinked
sir
stockpiled
you
how
much
did
they
pay
you
not
very
much
but
we
were
getting
the
training
instead
of
wages
did
that
come
out
of
the
pamphlets
they
gave
you
did
what
come
out
that
guff
about
receiving
training
instead
of
wages
said
lexington
any
company
that
really
wants
bright
trainees
will
compete
for
them
with
money
cold
hard
cash
not
platitudes
maybe
you
saw
a
few
of
their
products
being
made
maybe
you
did
but
you
a
lot
weaker
in
calculus
than
when
you
left
school
and
in
a
dozen
other
subjects
too
are
you
well
nothing
we
did
on
the
course
involved
higher
mathematics
peter
admitted
cautiously
and
i
suppose
i
could
use
a
refresher
course
in
calculus
just
as
i
said
they
stockpiled
you
instead
of
using
you
as
an
engineer
they
hired
you
at
a
cut
wage
and
taught
you
things
that
would
be
useful
only
in
their
own
company
while
in
the
meantime
you
were
getting
weaker
in
the
subjects
you
paid
to
learn
or
are
you
one
of
these
birds
that
had
the
shot
paid
for
him
i
worked
my
way
through
said
peter
stiffly
if
you
stayed
with
them
five
years
do
you
think
you
be
able
to
get
a
job
with
someone
else
peter
considered
his
answer
carefully
every
man
the
association
had
sent
had
been
turned
away
that
meant
bluffs
did
work
neither
seen
for
himself
did
allowing
himself
to
be
intimidated
i
had
thought
about
it
he
said
i
suppose
it
would
have
been
easy
impossible
you
mean
you
would
know
a
single
thing
except
their
procedures
their
catalogue
numbers
their
way
of
doing
things
and
you
have
forgotten
so
much
of
your
engineering
training
you
be
scared
to
take
on
an
engineer
job
for
fear
you
be
asked
to
do
something
you
forgotten
how
to
do
at
that
point
they
could
take
you
out
of
the
stockpile
put
you
in
just
about
any
job
they
wanted
at
any
wage
you
stand
for
and
they
have
an
indentured
worker
with
a
degree
but
not
the
price
tag
you
see
that
now
it
made
peter
feel
he
had
been
suckered
but
he
had
decided
to
play
this
straight
all
the
way
he
nodded
why
you
leave
lexington
pursued
unrelenting
i
finished
the
course
and
the
increase
they
offered
on
a
permanent
basis
was
enough
so
i
went
elsewhere
with
your
head
full
of
this
nonsense
about
a
shortage
of
engineers
peter
swallowed
i
thought
it
would
be
easier
to
get
a
job
than
it
has
been
yes
they
start
the
talk
about
a
shortage
and
then
they
keep
it
going
why
so
youngsters
will
take
up
engineering
thinking
they
wind
up
among
a
highly
paid
minority
you
did
did
you
yes
sir
and
so
did
all
the
others
there
with
you
at
school
and
in
this
stockpiling
outfit
that
right
well
said
lexington
unexpectedly
there
a
shortage
and
the
stockpiles
are
the
ones
who
made
it
and
who
keep
it
going
and
the
hell
of
it
is
that
they
ca
stop
when
one
does
it
they
all
have
to
or
their
costs
get
out
of
line
and
they
ca
compete
what
the
solution
i
do
know
peter
said
lexington
leaned
back
that
quite
a
lot
of
admissions
you
made
what
makes
you
think
you
qualified
for
the
job
i
offering
you
said
you
wanted
an
engineer
and
i
just
proved
you
less
of
an
engineer
than
when
you
left
school
i
have
have
i
all
right
you
have
peter
said
angrily
and
now
you
wondering
why
i
do
get
somebody
fresh
out
of
school
right
peter
straightened
up
and
met
the
old
man
challenging
gaze
that
and
whether
you
giving
me
a
hard
time
just
for
the
hell
of
it
well
am
i
lexington
demanded
looking
at
him
squarely
seeing
the
intensity
of
the
eyes
peter
had
the
startling
feeling
that
lexington
was
rooting
for
him
no
you
not
then
what
am
i
after
suppose
you
tell
me
so
suddenly
that
it
was
almost
like
a
collapse
the
tension
went
out
of
the
old
man
face
and
shoulders
he
nodded
with
inexpressible
tiredness
good
again
the
man
i
want
does
exist
he
has
to
be
made
the
same
as
i
was
you
qualify
so
far
you
lost
your
illusions
but
have
had
time
yet
to
replace
them
with
dogma
or
cynicism
or
bitterness
you
saw
immediately
that
fake
humility
or
cockiness
would
get
you
anywhere
here
and
you
were
right
those
were
the
important
things
the
background
data
i
got
from
the
association
on
you
counted
of
course
but
only
if
you
were
teachable
i
think
you
are
am
i
right
at
least
i
can
face
knowing
how
much
i
do
know
said
peter
if
that
answers
the
question
it
does
partly
what
did
you
notice
about
this
plant
in
precis
form
peter
listed
his
observations
the
absence
of
windows
at
sides
and
rear
the
unusual
amount
of
power
the
automatic
doors
the
lack
of
employees
entrances
very
good
said
lexington
most
people
only
notice
the
automatic
doors
anything
else
yes
peter
said
you
the
only
person
i
seen
in
the
building
i
the
only
one
there
is
peter
stared
his
disbelief
automated
plants
were
nothing
new
but
they
all
had
their
limitations
either
they
dealt
with
exactly
similar
products
or
things
that
could
be
handled
on
a
flow
basis
like
oil
or
chemicals
even
these
had
no
more
to
do
than
process
the
goods
come
on
said
lexington
getting
massively
to
his
feet
i
show
you
the
office
door
opened
and
peter
found
himself
being
led
down
the
antiseptic
corridor
to
another
door
which
had
opened
giving
access
to
the
manufacturing
area
as
they
moved
along
between
rows
of
seemingly
disorganized
machinery
peter
noticed
that
the
factory
lights
high
overhead
followed
their
progress
turning
themselves
on
in
advance
of
their
coming
and
going
out
after
they
had
passed
keeping
a
pool
of
illumination
only
in
the
immediate
area
they
occupied
soon
they
reached
a
large
door
which
peter
recognized
as
the
inside
of
the
truck
loading
door
he
had
seen
from
outside
lexington
paused
here
this
is
the
bay
used
by
the
trucks
arriving
with
raw
materials
he
said
they
back
up
to
this
door
and
a
set
of
automatic
jacks
outside
lines
up
the
trailer
body
with
the
door
exactly
then
the
door
opens
and
the
truck
is
unloaded
by
these
materials
handling
machines
peter
did
see
him
touch
anything
but
as
he
spoke
three
glistening
machines
apparently
rolled
noiselessly
up
to
the
door
in
formation
and
stopped
there
apparently
waiting
to
be
inspected
they
gave
peter
the
creeps
simple
square
boxes
set
on
casters
with
two
arms
each
mounted
on
the
sides
might
have
looked
similar
the
arms
fashioned
much
like
human
arms
hung
at
the
sides
not
limply
but
in
a
relaxed
position
that
somehow
indicated
readiness
lexington
went
over
to
one
of
them
and
patted
it
lovingly
really
these
machines
are
only
an
extension
of
one
large
machine
the
whole
plant
as
a
matter
of
fact
is
controlled
from
one
point
and
is
really
a
single
unit
these
materials
handlers
or
manipulators
were
about
the
toughest
things
in
the
place
to
design
but
they
tremendously
useful
you
see
a
lot
of
them
around
lexington
was
about
to
leave
the
side
of
the
machine
when
abruptly
one
of
the
arms
rose
to
the
handkerchief
in
his
breast
pocket
and
daintily
tugged
it
into
a
more
attractive
position
it
took
only
a
split
second
and
before
lexington
could
react
all
three
machines
were
moving
away
to
attend
to
mysterious
duties
of
their
own
peter
tore
his
eyes
away
from
them
in
time
to
see
the
look
of
frustrated
embarrassment
that
crossed
lexington
face
only
to
be
replaced
by
one
of
anger
he
said
nothing
however
and
led
peter
to
a
large
bay
where
racks
of
steel
plate
bar
forms
nuts
bolts
and
other
materials
were
stored
after
unloading
a
truck
the
machines
check
the
shipment
report
any
shortages
or
overages
and
store
the
materials
here
he
said
the
trace
of
anger
not
yet
gone
from
his
voice
when
an
order
is
received
it
translated
into
the
catalogue
numbers
used
internally
within
the
plant
and
machines
like
the
ones
you
just
saw
withdraw
the
necessary
materials
from
stock
make
the
component
parts
assemble
them
and
package
the
finished
goods
for
shipment
simultaneously
an
order
is
sent
to
the
billing
section
to
bill
the
customer
and
an
order
is
sent
to
our
trucker
to
come
and
pick
the
shipment
up
meanwhile
if
the
withdrawal
of
the
materials
required
has
depleted
our
stock
the
purchasing
section
is
instructed
to
order
more
raw
materials
i
take
you
through
the
manufacturing
and
assembly
sections
right
now
but
they
too
noisy
for
me
to
explain
what
going
on
while
we
there
peter
followed
numbly
as
lexington
led
him
through
a
maze
of
machines
each
one
seemingly
intent
on
cutting
bending
welding
grinding
or
carrying
some
bit
of
metal
or
just
standing
idle
waiting
for
something
to
do
the
manipulators
peter
had
just
seen
were
everywhere
scuttling
from
machine
to
machine
apparently
with
an
exact
knowledge
of
what
they
were
doing
and
the
most
efficient
way
of
doing
it
he
wondered
what
would
happen
if
one
of
them
tried
to
use
the
same
aisle
they
were
using
he
pictured
a
futile
attempt
to
escape
the
onrushing
wheels
saw
himself
clambering
out
of
the
path
of
the
speeding
vehicle
just
in
time
to
fall
into
the
jaws
of
the
punch
press
that
was
laboring
beside
him
at
the
moment
nervously
he
looked
for
an
exit
but
his
apprehension
was
unnecessary
the
machines
seemed
to
know
where
they
were
and
avoided
the
two
men
or
stopped
to
wait
for
them
to
go
by
back
in
the
office
section
of
the
building
lexington
indicated
a
small
room
where
a
typewriter
could
be
heard
clattering
away
standard
business
machines
operated
by
the
central
control
mechanism
in
that
room
he
said
as
the
door
swung
open
and
peter
saw
that
the
typewriter
was
actually
a
sort
of
teletype
with
no
one
before
the
keyboard
incoming
mail
is
sorted
and
inquiries
are
replied
to
in
this
one
over
here
purchase
orders
are
prepared
and
across
the
hall
there
a
very
similar
rig
set
up
in
conjunction
with
an
automatic
bookkeeper
to
keep
track
of
the
pennies
and
to
bill
the
customers
then
all
you
do
is
read
the
incoming
mail
and
maintain
the
machinery
asked
peter
trying
to
shake
off
the
feeling
of
open
amazement
that
had
engulfed
him
i
do
even
do
those
things
except
for
a
few
letters
that
come
in
every
week
that
it
does
want
to
deal
with
by
itself
the
shock
of
what
he
had
just
seen
was
showing
plainly
on
peter
face
when
they
walked
back
into
lexington
office
and
sat
down
lexington
looked
at
him
for
quite
a
while
without
saying
anything
his
face
sagging
and
pale
peter
did
trust
himself
to
speak
and
let
the
silence
remain
unbroken
finally
lexington
spoke
i
know
it
hard
to
believe
but
there
it
is
hard
to
believe
said
peter
i
almost
ca
the
trade
journals
run
articles
about
factories
like
this
one
but
planned
for
ten
maybe
twenty
years
in
the
future
damn
fools
exclaimed
lexington
getting
part
of
his
breath
back
they
could
have
had
it
years
ago
if
they
been
willing
to
drop
their
idiotic
notions
about
specialization
lexington
mopped
his
forehead
with
a
large
white
handkerchief
apparently
the
walk
through
the
factory
had
tired
him
considerably
although
it
had
been
strenuous
he
leaned
back
in
his
chair
and
began
to
talk
in
a
low
voice
completely
in
contrast
with
the
overbearing
manner
he
had
used
upon
arrival
you
know
what
we
make
of
course
yes
sir
conduit
fittings
and
a
lot
of
other
electrical
products
too
i
started
out
in
this
business
twenty
years
ago
using
orthodox
techniques
i
never
got
through
university
i
took
a
couple
of
years
of
an
arts
course
and
got
so
interested
in
biology
that
i
did
study
anything
else
they
bounced
me
out
of
the
course
and
i
in
engineering
determined
not
to
make
the
same
mistake
again
but
i
did
i
got
too
absorbed
in
those
parts
of
the
course
that
had
to
do
with
electrical
theory
and
lost
the
rest
as
a
result
the
same
thing
happened
when
i
tried
commerce
with
accounting
so
i
gave
up
and
started
working
for
one
of
my
competitors
it
was
too
long
before
i
saw
that
the
only
way
i
could
get
ahead
was
to
open
up
on
my
own
lexington
sank
deeper
in
his
chair
and
stared
at
the
ceiling
as
he
spoke
i
put
myself
in
hock
to
the
eyeballs
which
was
easy
because
i
had
just
got
married
and
started
off
in
a
very
small
way
after
three
years
i
had
a
fairly
decent
little
business
going
and
i
suppose
it
would
have
grown
just
like
any
other
business
except
for
a
strike
that
came
along
and
put
me
right
back
where
i
started
my
wife
whom
i
afraid
i
had
neglected
for
the
sake
of
the
business
was
killed
in
a
car
accident
about
then
and
rightly
or
wrongly
that
made
me
angrier
with
the
union
than
anything
else
if
the
union
made
things
so
tough
for
me
from
the
beginning
i
have
had
more
time
to
spend
with
my
wife
before
her
death
as
things
turned
out
well
i
remember
looking
down
at
her
coffin
and
thinking
that
i
hardly
knew
the
girl
for
the
next
few
years
i
concentrated
on
getting
rid
of
as
many
employees
as
i
could
by
replacing
them
with
automatic
machines
design
the
control
circuits
myself
in
many
cases
wire
the
things
up
myself
always
concentrating
on
replacing
men
with
machines
but
it
was
very
successful
i
found
that
the
more
automatic
i
made
my
plant
the
lower
my
costs
went
the
lower
my
costs
went
the
more
business
i
got
and
the
more
i
had
to
expand
lexington
scowled
i
got
sick
of
it
i
decided
to
try
developing
one
control
circuit
that
would
control
everything
from
ordering
the
raw
materials
to
shipping
the
finished
goods
as
i
told
you
i
had
taken
quite
an
interest
in
biology
when
i
was
in
school
and
from
studies
of
nerve
tissue
in
particular
plus
my
electrical
knowledge
i
had
a
few
ideas
on
how
to
do
it
it
took
me
three
years
but
i
began
to
see
that
i
could
develop
circuitry
that
could
remember
compare
detect
similarities
and
so
on
not
the
way
they
do
it
today
of
course
to
do
what
i
wanted
to
do
with
these
big
clumsy
magnetic
drums
tapes
and
you
need
a
building
the
size
of
mount
everest
but
i
found
that
i
could
let
organic
chemistry
do
most
of
the
work
for
me
by
creating
the
proper
compounds
with
their
molecules
arranged
in
predetermined
matrixes
i
found
i
could
duplicate
electrical
circuitry
in
units
so
tiny
that
my
biggest
problem
was
getting
into
and
out
of
the
logic
units
with
conventional
wiring
i
finally
beat
that
the
same
way
they
solved
the
problem
of
translating
a
picture
on
a
screen
into
electrical
signals
developed
equipment
to
scan
the
units
cyclically
and
once
i
done
that
the
battle
was
over
i
built
this
building
and
incorporated
it
as
a
separate
company
to
compete
with
my
first
outfit
in
the
beginning
i
had
it
rigged
up
to
do
only
the
manual
work
that
you
saw
being
done
a
few
minutes
ago
in
the
back
of
this
place
i
figured
that
the
best
thing
for
me
to
do
would
be
to
turn
the
job
of
selling
my
stuff
over
to
jobbers
leaving
me
free
to
do
nothing
except
receive
orders
punch
the
catalogue
numbers
into
the
control
console
do
the
billing
and
collect
the
money
what
happened
to
your
original
company
peter
asked
lexington
smiled
well
automated
as
it
was
it
could
compete
with
this
plant
it
gave
me
great
pleasure
three
years
after
this
one
started
working
to
see
my
old
company
go
belly
up
this
company
bought
the
old
firm
equipment
for
next
to
nothing
and
i
wound
up
with
all
my
assets
but
only
one
employee
me
i
thought
everything
would
be
rosy
from
that
point
on
but
it
was
i
found
that
i
could
keep
up
with
the
mail
unless
i
worked
impossible
hours
i
added
a
couple
of
new
pieces
of
equipment
to
the
control
section
one
was
simply
a
huge
memory
bank
the
other
was
a
comparator
circuit
a
complicated
one
but
a
comparator
circuit
nevertheless
here
i
was
working
on
instinct
more
than
anything
i
figured
that
if
i
interconnected
these
circuits
in
such
a
way
that
they
could
sense
everything
that
went
on
in
the
plant
and
compare
one
action
with
another
by
and
by
the
unit
would
be
able
to
see
patterns
then
through
the
existing
command
output
i
figured
these
new
units
would
be
able
to
control
the
plant
continuing
the
various
patterns
of
activity
that
i
already
established
here
lexington
frowned
it
did
work
worth
a
damn
it
just
sat
there
and
did
nothing
i
could
understand
it
for
the
longest
time
and
then
i
realized
what
the
trouble
was
i
put
a
kicker
circuit
into
it
a
sort
of
network
i
reset
the
equipment
so
that
while
it
was
still
under
instructions
to
receive
orders
and
produce
goods
its
prime
purpose
was
to
activate
the
kicker
the
kicker
however
could
only
be
activated
by
me
manually
lastly
i
set
up
one
of
the
early
tv
pickups
over
the
mail
slitter
and
allowed
every
letter
i
received
every
order
to
be
fed
into
the
memory
banks
that
did
it
i
i
do
understand
stammered
peter
simple
whenever
i
was
pleased
that
things
were
going
smoothly
i
pressed
the
kicker
button
the
machine
had
one
purpose
so
far
as
its
logic
circuits
were
concerned
its
object
was
to
get
me
to
press
that
button
every
day
i
press
it
at
the
same
time
unless
things
going
well
if
there
had
been
trouble
in
the
shop
i
press
it
late
or
maybe
not
at
all
if
all
the
orders
were
out
on
schedule
or
ahead
of
time
i
press
it
ahead
of
time
or
maybe
twice
in
the
same
day
pretty
soon
the
machine
got
the
idea
i
never
forget
the
day
i
picked
up
an
incoming
order
form
from
one
of
the
western
jobbers
and
found
that
the
keyboard
was
locked
when
i
tried
to
punch
it
into
the
control
console
it
completely
baffled
me
at
first
then
while
i
was
tracing
out
the
circuits
to
see
if
i
could
discover
what
was
holding
the
keyboard
lock
in
i
noticed
that
the
order
was
already
entered
on
the
list
i
was
a
long
time
convincing
myself
that
it
had
really
happened
but
there
was
no
other
explanation
the
machine
had
realized
that
whenever
one
of
those
forms
came
in
i
copied
the
list
of
goods
from
it
onto
the
list
through
the
console
keyboard
thus
activating
the
producing
mechanisms
in
the
back
of
the
plant
the
machine
had
done
it
for
me
this
time
then
locked
the
keyboard
so
i
could
enter
the
order
twice
i
think
i
held
down
the
kicker
button
for
a
full
five
minutes
that
day
this
kicker
button
peter
said
tentatively
it
like
the
pleasure
center
in
an
animal
brain
is
it
when
lexington
beamed
peter
felt
a
surge
of
relief
talking
with
this
man
was
like
walking
a
tightrope
a
word
too
much
or
a
word
too
little
might
mean
the
difference
between
getting
the
job
or
losing
it
exactly
whispered
lexington
in
an
almost
conspiratorial
tone
i
had
altered
the
circuitry
of
the
machine
so
that
it
tried
to
give
me
pleasure
because
by
doing
so
its
own
pleasure
circuit
would
be
activated
things
went
fast
from
then
on
once
i
realized
that
the
machine
was
learning
i
put
tv
monitors
all
over
the
place
so
the
machine
could
watch
everything
that
was
going
on
after
a
short
while
i
had
to
increase
the
memory
bank
and
later
i
increased
it
again
but
the
rewards
were
worth
it
soon
by
watching
what
i
did
and
then
by
doing
it
for
me
next
time
it
had
to
be
done
the
machine
had
learned
to
do
almost
everything
and
i
had
time
to
sit
back
and
count
my
winnings
at
this
point
the
door
opened
and
a
small
cart
wheeled
silently
into
the
room
stopping
in
front
of
peter
it
waited
until
he
had
taken
a
small
plate
laden
with
two
or
three
cakes
off
its
surface
then
the
soft
evenly
modulated
voice
he
had
heard
before
asked
how
do
you
like
your
coffee
cream
sugar
both
or
black
peter
looked
for
the
speaker
in
the
side
of
the
cart
saw
nothing
and
replied
feeling
slightly
silly
as
he
did
so
black
please
a
square
hole
appeared
in
the
top
of
the
cart
like
the
elevator
hole
in
an
aircraft
carrier
deck
when
the
section
of
the
cart
surface
rose
again
a
fine
china
cup
containing
steaming
black
coffee
rested
on
it
peter
took
it
and
sipped
it
as
he
supposed
he
was
expected
to
do
while
the
cart
proceeded
over
to
lexington
desk
once
there
it
stopped
again
and
another
cup
of
coffee
rose
to
its
surface
lexington
took
the
coffee
from
the
top
of
the
car
obviously
angry
about
something
silently
he
waited
until
the
cart
had
left
the
office
then
snapped
look
at
those
bloody
cups
peter
looked
at
his
which
was
eggshell
thin
fluted
with
carving
and
ornately
covered
with
gold
leaf
they
look
very
expensive
he
said
not
only
expensive
but
stupid
and
impractical
exploded
lexington
they
only
hold
half
a
cup
they
break
at
a
touch
every
one
has
to
be
matched
with
its
own
saucer
and
if
you
use
them
for
any
length
of
time
the
gold
leaf
comes
off
peter
searched
for
a
comment
found
none
that
fitted
this
odd
outburst
so
he
kept
silent
lexington
stared
at
his
cup
without
touching
it
for
a
long
while
then
he
continued
with
his
narrative
i
suppose
it
all
my
own
fault
i
did
detect
the
symptoms
soon
enough
after
this
plant
got
working
properly
i
started
living
here
it
was
a
question
of
saving
money
i
hated
to
waste
two
hours
a
day
driving
to
and
from
my
house
and
i
also
wanted
to
be
on
hand
in
case
anything
should
go
wrong
that
the
machine
could
fix
for
itself
handling
the
cup
as
if
it
were
going
to
shatter
at
any
moment
he
took
a
gulp
i
began
to
see
that
the
machine
could
understand
the
written
word
and
i
tried
hooking
a
teletype
directly
into
the
logic
circuits
it
was
like
uncorking
a
seltzer
bottle
the
machine
had
a
funny
vocabulary
all
of
it
gleaned
from
letters
it
had
seen
coming
in
and
replies
it
had
seen
leaving
but
it
was
intelligible
it
even
displayed
some
traces
of
the
personality
the
machine
was
acquiring
it
had
chosen
a
name
for
itself
for
instance
that
shook
me
you
might
think
lex
industries
was
named
through
an
abbreviation
of
the
name
lexington
but
it
was
my
wife
name
was
alexis
and
it
was
named
after
the
nickname
she
always
used
i
objected
of
course
but
how
can
you
object
on
a
point
like
that
to
a
machine
bear
in
mind
that
i
had
to
be
careful
to
behave
reasonably
at
all
times
because
the
machine
was
still
learning
from
me
and
i
was
afraid
that
any
tantrums
i
threw
might
be
imitated
it
sounds
pretty
awkward
peter
put
in
you
do
know
the
half
of
it
as
time
went
on
i
had
less
and
less
to
do
and
i
found
that
the
entire
control
of
the
operation
was
slipping
from
my
grasp
many
times
i
discovered
too
late
that
the
machine
had
taken
the
damnedest
risks
you
ever
saw
on
bids
and
contracts
for
supply
it
was
quoting
impossible
delivery
times
on
some
orders
and
charging
pirate
prices
on
others
all
without
any
obvious
reason
inexplicably
we
always
came
out
on
top
it
would
turn
out
that
on
the
quotations
we
been
up
against
stiff
competition
and
cutting
the
production
time
was
the
only
way
we
could
get
the
order
on
the
quotes
i
find
that
no
one
else
was
bidding
we
were
making
more
money
than
i
ever
dreamed
of
and
to
make
it
still
better
i
find
that
for
months
i
had
virtually
nothing
to
do
it
sounds
wonderful
sir
said
peter
feeling
dazzled
it
was
in
a
way
i
remember
one
day
i
was
especially
pleased
with
something
and
i
went
to
the
control
console
to
give
the
kicker
button
a
long
hard
push
the
button
much
to
my
amazement
had
been
removed
and
a
blank
plate
had
been
installed
to
cover
the
opening
in
the
board
i
went
over
to
the
teletype
and
punched
in
the
shortest
message
i
had
ever
sent
what
the
hell
i
typed
the
answer
came
back
in
the
jargon
it
had
learned
from
letters
it
had
seen
and
i
remember
it
as
if
it
just
happened
a
lexington
lex
industries
dear
sir
re
your
letter
of
the
thirteenth
i
am
pleased
to
advise
you
that
i
am
able
to
discern
whether
or
not
you
are
pleased
with
my
service
without
the
use
of
the
equipment
previously
used
for
this
purpose
respectfully
i
might
suggest
that
if
the
pushbutton
arrangement
were
necessary
i
could
push
the
button
myself
i
do
not
believe
this
would
meet
with
your
approval
and
have
taken
steps
to
relieve
you
of
the
burden
involved
in
remembering
to
push
the
button
each
time
you
are
especially
pleased
i
should
like
to
take
this
opportunity
to
thank
you
for
your
inquiry
and
look
forward
to
serving
you
in
the
future
as
i
have
in
the
past
yours
faithfully
lex
peter
burst
out
laughing
and
lexington
smiled
wryly
that
was
my
reaction
at
first
too
but
time
began
to
weigh
very
heavily
on
my
hands
and
i
was
lonely
too
i
began
to
wonder
whether
or
not
it
would
be
possible
to
build
a
voice
circuit
into
the
unit
i
increased
the
memory
storage
banks
again
put
audio
pickups
and
loudspeakers
all
over
the
place
and
began
teaching
lex
to
talk
each
time
a
letter
came
in
i
stop
it
under
a
video
pickup
and
read
it
aloud
nothing
happened
then
i
got
a
dictionary
and
instructed
one
of
the
materials
handlers
to
turn
the
pages
so
that
the
machine
got
a
look
at
every
page
i
read
the
pronunciation
page
aloud
so
that
lex
would
be
able
to
interpret
the
pronunciation
marks
and
hoped
still
nothing
happened
one
day
i
suddenly
realized
what
the
trouble
was
i
remember
standing
up
in
this
very
office
feeling
silly
as
i
did
it
and
saying
please
try
to
speak
to
me
i
had
never
asked
the
machine
to
say
anything
you
see
i
had
only
provided
the
mechanism
whereby
it
was
able
to
do
so
did
it
reply
sir
lexington
nodded
gave
me
the
shock
of
my
life
the
voice
that
came
back
was
the
one
you
heard
over
the
telephone
a
little
awkward
then
the
syllables
clumsy
and
poorly
put
together
but
the
voice
was
the
same
i
had
built
in
any
specific
tone
range
you
see
all
i
did
was
equip
the
machine
to
record
in
exacting
detail
the
frequencies
and
modulations
it
found
in
normal
pronunciation
as
i
used
it
then
i
provided
a
tone
generator
to
span
the
entire
audio
range
which
could
be
very
rapidly
controlled
by
the
machine
both
in
volume
and
pitch
with
auxiliaries
to
provide
just
about
any
combinations
of
harmonics
that
were
needed
i
later
found
that
lex
had
added
to
this
without
my
knowing
about
it
but
that
does
change
things
i
thought
the
only
thing
it
had
heard
was
my
voice
and
i
expected
to
hear
my
own
noises
imitated
where
did
the
machine
get
the
voice
asked
peter
still
amazed
that
the
voice
he
had
heard
on
the
telephone
in
the
reception
hall
and
from
the
coffee
cart
had
actually
been
the
voice
of
the
computer
damned
foolishness
snorted
lexington
the
machine
saw
what
i
was
trying
to
do
the
moment
i
sketched
it
out
and
ordered
the
parts
within
a
week
i
found
out
later
it
had
pulled
some
odds
and
ends
together
and
built
itself
a
standard
radio
receiver
then
it
listened
in
on
every
radio
program
that
was
going
and
had
most
of
the
vocabulary
tied
in
with
the
written
word
by
the
time
i
was
ready
to
start
out
of
all
the
voices
it
could
have
chosen
it
picked
the
one
you
already
heard
as
the
one
likely
to
please
me
most
it
a
very
pleasant
voice
sir
sure
but
do
you
know
where
it
came
from
soap
opera
it
voice
from
life
and
loves
of
mary
lexington
glared
and
peter
was
sure
whether
he
should
sympathize
with
him
or
congratulate
him
after
a
moment
the
anger
wore
off
lexington
face
and
he
shifted
in
his
chair
staring
at
his
now
empty
cup
that
when
i
realized
the
thing
was
taking
on
characteristics
that
were
more
than
i
bargained
for
it
had
learned
that
it
was
my
provider
and
existed
to
serve
me
but
it
had
gone
further
and
wanted
to
be
all
that
it
could
be
provider
protector
companion
if
you
like
hence
the
gradual
trend
toward
characteristics
that
were
as
distinctly
female
as
a
silk
negligee
worse
still
it
had
learned
that
when
i
was
pleased
i
did
always
admit
it
and
simply
refused
to
believe
that
i
would
have
it
any
other
way
could
you
have
done
something
to
the
circuitry
asked
peter
i
suppose
i
could
said
lexington
but
in
asking
that
you
realize
how
far
the
thing
had
gone
i
had
long
since
passed
the
point
when
i
could
look
upon
her
as
a
machine
business
was
tremendous
i
had
no
complaints
on
that
score
and
tinkering
with
her
personality
well
it
was
like
committing
some
kind
of
homicide
i
might
as
well
face
it
i
suppose
she
acts
like
a
woman
and
i
think
of
her
as
one
at
first
when
i
recognized
this
trend
for
what
it
was
i
tried
to
stop
it
she
ordered
a
subscription
to
magazine
of
all
things
in
order
to
find
out
the
latest
in
silverware
china
and
so
on
i
called
up
the
local
distributor
and
canceled
the
subscription
i
had
no
sooner
hung
up
the
telephone
than
her
voice
came
over
the
speaker
very
softly
mind
you
and
her
inflections
by
this
time
were
superb
was
she
said
three
lousy
words
and
i
found
myself
phoning
the
guy
right
back
saying
i
was
sorry
and
would
he
please
not
cancel
he
must
have
thought
i
was
nuts
peter
smiled
and
lexington
made
as
if
to
rise
from
his
chair
thought
the
better
of
it
and
shifted
his
bulk
to
one
side
well
there
it
is
he
said
softly
we
reached
that
stage
eight
years
ago
peter
was
thunderstruck
but
if
this
factory
is
twenty
years
ahead
of
the
times
now
it
must
have
been
almost
thirty
then
lexington
nodded
i
figured
fifty
at
the
time
but
things
are
moving
faster
nowadays
lex
has
stood
still
of
course
she
still
reads
all
the
trade
journals
from
cover
to
cover
and
we
keep
up
with
the
world
if
something
new
comes
up
we
in
on
it
and
fast
we
going
to
be
ahead
of
the
pack
for
a
long
time
to
come
if
you
excuse
me
sir
said
peter
i
do
see
where
i
fit
in
peter
did
realize
lexington
was
answering
his
question
at
first
a
few
weeks
ago
the
old
man
murmured
i
decided
to
see
a
doctor
been
feeling
low
for
quite
a
while
and
i
thought
it
was
about
time
i
attended
to
a
little
personal
maintenance
lexington
looked
peter
squarely
in
the
face
and
said
the
report
was
that
i
have
a
heart
ailment
that
apt
to
knock
me
off
any
second
ca
anything
be
done
about
it
asked
peter
rest
is
the
only
prescription
he
could
give
me
and
he
said
that
would
only
spin
out
my
life
a
little
aside
from
that
no
hope
i
see
said
peter
then
you
looking
for
someone
to
learn
the
business
and
let
you
retire
it
not
retirement
that
the
problem
said
lexington
i
be
able
to
go
away
on
trips
i
tried
that
and
i
always
have
to
hurry
back
because
something
gone
wrong
she
ca
fix
for
herself
i
know
the
reason
and
there
nothing
i
can
do
about
it
it
the
way
she
built
if
nobody
here
she
gets
lonely
lexington
studied
the
desk
top
silently
for
a
moment
before
finishing
quietly
got
to
stay
here
to
look
after
lex
at
six
three
hours
after
he
had
entered
lexington
plant
peter
left
lexington
did
not
follow
him
down
the
corridor
he
seemed
exhausted
after
the
afternoon
discussion
and
indicated
that
peter
should
find
his
own
way
out
this
of
course
presented
no
difficulty
with
lex
opening
the
doors
for
him
but
it
gave
peter
an
opportunity
he
had
been
hoping
for
he
stopped
in
the
reception
room
before
crossing
the
threshold
of
the
front
door
which
stood
open
for
him
he
turned
and
spoke
to
the
apparently
empty
room
lex
he
said
he
wanted
to
say
that
he
was
flattered
that
he
was
being
considered
for
the
job
it
was
what
a
should
say
at
that
point
to
the
boss
secretary
but
when
the
soft
voice
came
back
yes
mr
manners
saying
anything
like
that
to
a
machine
felt
suddenly
silly
he
said
i
wanted
you
to
know
that
it
was
a
pleasure
to
meet
you
thank
you
said
the
voice
if
it
had
said
more
he
might
have
but
it
did
still
feeling
a
little
embarrassed
he
went
home
at
four
in
the
morning
his
phone
rang
it
was
lexington
manners
the
old
man
gasped
the
voice
was
an
alarm
manners
sat
bolt
upright
clutching
the
phone
what
the
matter
sir
my
chest
lexington
panted
i
can
feel
it
like
a
knife
on
i
just
wanted
to
wait
a
minute
there
was
a
confused
scratching
noise
interrupted
by
a
few
mumbles
in
the
phone
what
going
on
mr
lexington
peter
cried
but
it
was
several
seconds
before
he
got
an
answer
that
better
said
lexington
his
voice
stronger
he
apologized
i
sorry
lex
must
have
heard
me
she
sent
in
one
of
the
materials
handlers
with
a
hypo
it
helps
the
voice
on
the
phone
paused
then
said
but
i
doubt
that
anything
can
help
very
much
at
this
point
i
glad
i
saw
you
today
i
want
you
to
come
around
in
the
morning
if
i
not
here
lex
will
give
you
some
papers
to
sign
there
was
another
pause
with
sounds
of
harsh
breathing
then
strained
again
the
old
man
voice
said
i
guess
i
wo
be
here
lex
will
take
care
of
it
come
early
the
distant
receiver
clicked
peter
manners
sat
on
the
edge
of
his
bed
in
momentary
confusion
then
made
up
his
mind
in
the
short
hours
he
had
known
him
he
had
come
to
have
a
definite
fondness
for
the
old
man
and
there
were
times
when
machines
were
enough
when
lexington
should
have
another
human
being
by
his
side
clearly
this
was
one
such
time
peter
dressed
in
a
hurry
miraculously
found
a
cruising
cab
sped
through
empty
streets
leaped
out
in
front
of
lex
industries
plain
concrete
walls
ran
to
the
door
in
the
waiting
room
the
soft
distant
voice
of
lex
said
he
wanted
you
to
be
here
mr
manners
come
a
door
opened
and
wordlessly
he
walked
through
it
to
the
main
room
of
the
factory
he
stopped
staring
four
squat
materials
handlers
were
quietly
slowly
carrying
old
lexington
no
not
the
man
the
lifeless
body
that
had
been
lexington
carrying
the
body
of
the
old
man
down
the
center
aisle
between
the
automatic
lathes
peter
protested
wait
i
get
a
doctor
but
the
massive
handling
machines
did
respond
and
the
gentle
voice
of
lex
said
it
too
late
for
that
mr
manners
slowly
and
reverently
they
placed
the
body
on
the
work
table
of
a
huge
milling
machine
that
stood
in
the
exact
center
of
the
factory
main
floor
elsewhere
in
the
plant
a
safety
valve
in
the
lubricating
oil
system
was
being
bolted
down
when
that
was
done
the
pressure
in
the
system
began
to
rise
near
the
loading
door
a
lubricating
oil
pipe
burst
another
on
the
other
side
of
the
building
split
lengthwise
a
few
seconds
later
sending
a
shower
of
oil
over
everything
in
the
vicinity
near
the
front
office
a
stream
of
it
was
running
across
the
floor
and
at
the
rear
of
the
building
in
the
storage
area
one
of
the
materials
handlers
had
just
finished
cutting
a
pipe
that
led
to
the
main
oil
tank
in
fifteen
minutes
there
was
free
oil
in
every
corner
of
the
shop
all
the
materials
handlers
were
now
assembled
around
the
milling
machine
like
mourners
at
a
funeral
in
a
sense
they
were
in
another
sense
they
were
taking
part
in
something
different
a
ceremony
that
originated
and
is
said
to
have
died
in
a
land
far
distant
from
the
lex
industries
plant
one
of
the
machines
approached
lexington
body
and
placed
his
hands
on
his
chest
abruptly
lex
said
you
better
go
now
peter
jumped
he
had
been
standing
paralyzed
for
what
seemed
a
long
time
there
was
a
movement
beside
him
a
materials
handler
holding
out
a
sheaf
of
papers
lex
said
these
have
to
go
to
lawyer
the
name
is
on
them
clutching
the
papers
for
a
hold
on
sanity
peter
cried
you
ca
do
this
he
did
build
you
just
so
you
could
two
materials
handlers
picked
him
up
with
steely
gentleness
and
carried
him
out
mr
manners
said
the
sweet
soft
voice
and
was
silent
he
stood
shaken
while
the
thin
jets
of
smoke
became
a
column
over
the
plain
building
while
the
fire
engines
raced
down
and
strung
their
hoses
too
late
it
was
an
act
of
suttee
the
widow
joining
her
husband
in
his
pyre
his
pyre
only
when
with
a
great
crash
the
roof
fell
in
did
peter
remember
the
papers
in
his
hand
last
will
and
testament
said
one
and
the
name
of
the
beneficiary
was
peter
own
certificate
of
adoption
said
another
and
it
was
a
legal
document
making
peter
old
man
lexington
adopted
son
peter
manners
stood
watching
the
hoses
of
the
firemen
hiss
against
what
was
left
of
lex
and
her
husband
he
had
got
the
job
