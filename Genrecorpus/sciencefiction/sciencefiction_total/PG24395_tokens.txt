the
winds
of
time
he
contracted
for
a
charter
trip
but
the
man
who
hired
his
spacer
was
quite
a
man
it
turned
out
and
he
wanted
more
than
service

gefty
rammer
came
along
the
narrow
passages
between
the
control
compartment
and
the
staterooms
trying
to
exchange
the
haggard
look
on
his
face
for
one
of
competent
there
was
nothing
to
gain
by
letting
his
two
passengers
suspect
that
during
the
past
few
minutes
their
pilot
the
owner
of
rammer
spacelines
had
been
a
bare
step
away
from
plain
and
fancy
gibbering
he
opened
the
door
to
maulbow
stateroom
and
went
inside
maulbow
face
very
pale
eyes
closed
lay
on
his
back
on
the
couch
still
unconscious
he
been
knocked
out
when
some
unknown
forces
suddenly
started
batting
the
around
as
the
had
never
been
batted
before
in
her
eighteen
years
of
spacefaring
kerim
ruse
maulbow
secretary
knelt
beside
her
employer
checking
his
pulse
she
looked
anxiously
up
at
gefty
what
did
you
find
out
she
asked
in
a
voice
that
was
not
very
steady
gefty
shrugged
nothing
definite
as
yet
the
ship
has
been
damaged
she
a
tough
tub
that
one
good
point
otherwise
well
i
climbed
into
a
suit
and
took
a
look
out
the
escape
hatch
and
i
saw
the
same
thing
there
that
the
screens
show
whatever
that
is
you
no
idea
then
of
what
happened
to
us
or
where
we
are
miss
ruse
persisted
she
was
a
rather
small
girl
with
large
beautiful
gray
eyes
and
thick
hair
at
the
moment
she
was
barefoot
and
in
a
sleeping
outfit
which
consisted
of
something
soft
wrapped
around
her
top
soft
and
floppy
trousers
below
the
black
hair
was
tousled
and
she
looked
around
fifteen
she
been
asleep
in
her
stateroom
when
something
smacked
the
and
she
was
sensible
enough
then
not
to
climb
out
of
the
bunk
safety
field
until
the
ship
finally
stopped
shuddering
and
bucking
about
that
made
her
the
only
one
of
the
three
persons
aboard
who
had
collected
no
bruises
she
was
scared
of
course
but
taking
the
situation
very
well
gefty
said
carefully
there
a
number
of
possibilities
it
obvious
that
the
has
been
knocked
out
of
normspace
and
it
may
take
some
time
to
find
out
how
to
get
her
back
there
but
the
main
thing
is
that
the
ship
intact
so
far
it
does
look
too
bad
miss
ruse
seemed
somewhat
reassured
gefty
could
hardly
have
said
the
same
for
himself
he
was
a
qualified
normspace
and
subspace
pilot
he
had
put
in
a
hitch
with
the
federation
navy
and
for
the
past
eight
years
he
been
ferrying
his
own
two
ships
about
the
hub
and
not
infrequently
beyond
the
federation
space
territories
but
he
had
never
heard
of
a
situation
like
this
what
he
saw
in
the
viewscreens
when
the
ship
steadied
enough
to
let
him
pick
himself
off
the
instrument
room
floor
and
again
a
few
minutes
later
and
with
much
more
immediacy
from
the
escape
hatch
made
no
sense
seemed
simply
to
have
no
meaning
the
pressure
meters
said
there
was
a
vacuum
outside
the
skin
that
vacuum
was
dark
even
but
here
and
there
came
momentary
suggestions
of
vague
light
and
color
occasional
pinpricks
of
brightness
showed
and
were
gone
and
there
had
been
one
startling
phenomenon
like
a
distant
giant
explosion
a
sudden
pallid
glare
in
the
dark
which
appeared
far
ahead
of
the
and
for
the
instant
it
remained
in
sight
seemed
to
be
rushing
directly
towards
them
it
had
given
gefty
the
feeling
that
the
ship
itself
was
plowing
at
high
speed
through
this
eerie
medium
but
he
had
cut
the
drives
to
the
merest
idling
pulse
as
soon
as
he
staggered
back
to
the
control
console
and
got
his
first
look
at
the
screens
so
it
must
have
been
the
light
that
had
moved
but
such
details
were
best
not
discussed
with
a
passenger
kerim
ruse
would
be
arriving
at
enough
disquieting
speculations
on
her
own
the
less
he
told
her
the
better
there
was
the
matter
of
the
location
instruments
the
only
set
gefty
had
been
able
to
obtain
any
reading
on
were
the
direction
indicators
and
what
they
appeared
to
indicate
was
that
the
was
turning
on
a
new
heading
something
like
twenty
times
a
second
gefty
asked
has
maulbow
shown
any
signs
of
waking
up
kerim
shook
her
head
his
breathing
and
pulse
seem
all
right
and
that
bump
on
his
head
does
look
really
bad
but
he
has
moved
at
all
can
you
think
of
anything
else
we
might
do
for
him
gefty
not
at
the
moment
gefty
said
he
has
broken
any
bones
we
see
how
he
feels
when
he
comes
out
of
it
he
was
wondering
about
maulbow
and
the
fact
that
this
charter
had
showed
some
unusual
features
from
the
beginning
kerim
was
a
friendly
sort
of
girl
they
got
to
calling
each
other
by
their
first
names
within
a
day
or
two
after
the
trip
started
but
after
that
she
seemed
to
be
avoiding
him
and
gefty
guessed
that
maulbow
had
spoken
to
her
probably
to
make
sure
that
kerim
did
let
any
of
her
employer
secrets
slip
out
maulbow
himself
was
as
aloof
and
taciturn
a
client
as
rammer
spacelines
ever
had
picked
up
a
lean
blond
character
of
indeterminate
age
with
pale
eyes
hard
mouth
why
he
had
selected
a
bulky
semifreighter
like
the
for
a
mineralogical
survey
jaunt
to
a
lifeless
little
sun
system
far
beyond
the
outposts
of
civilization
was
a
point
he
discuss
gefty
needing
the
charter
money
had
restrained
his
curiosity
if
maulbow
wanted
only
a
pilot
and
preferred
to
do
all
the
rest
of
the
work
himself
that
was
certainly
maulbow
affair
and
if
he
happened
to
be
up
to
something
illegal
though
it
was
difficult
to
imagine
what
customs
would
nail
him
when
they
got
back
to
the
hub
but
those
facts
looked
a
little
different
now
gefty
scratched
his
chin
inquired
do
you
happen
to
know
where
maulbow
keeps
the
keys
to
the
storage
vault
kerim
looked
startled
why
no
i
could
permit
you
to
take
the
keys
anyway
while
he
while
he
unconscious
you
know
that
gefty
grunted
any
idea
of
what
he
has
locked
up
in
the
vault
you
should
ask
me
her
eyes
widened
why
that
could
possibly
have
anything
to
do
with
what
happened
he
might
gefty
thought
have
reassured
her
a
little
too
much
he
said
i
would
know
but
i
do
want
to
just
sit
here
and
wonder
about
it
until
maulbow
wakes
up
until
we
back
in
normspace
we
better
not
miss
any
bets
because
one
thing
sure
if
this
has
happened
to
anybody
else
they
did
turn
up
again
to
report
it
you
see
kerim
apparently
did
she
went
pale
then
said
hesitantly
well
the
sealed
cases
maulbow
brought
out
from
the
hub
with
him
had
some
very
expensive
instruments
in
them
that
all
i
know
he
always
trusted
me
not
to
pry
into
his
business
any
more
than
my
secretarial
duties
required
and
of
course
i
have
you
do
know
then
what
it
was
he
brought
up
from
that
moon
a
few
hours
ago
those
two
big
cases
he
stowed
away
in
the
vault
no
i
do
gefty
you
see
he
has
told
me
what
the
purpose
of
this
trip
is
i
only
know
that
it
a
matter
of
great
importance
to
him
kerim
paused
added
from
the
careful
manner
maulbow
handled
the
cases
with
the
cranes
i
had
the
impression
that
whatever
was
inside
them
must
be
quite
heavy
i
noticed
that
gefty
said
it
was
much
help
well
i
tell
something
now
he
went
on
i
let
your
boss
keep
both
sets
of
keys
to
the
storage
vault
because
he
insisted
on
it
when
he
signed
the
charter
what
i
did
tell
him
was
that
i
could
make
up
a
duplicate
set
any
time
in
around
half
an
hour
oh
have
you
not
yet
but
i
intend
to
take
a
look
at
what
maulbow
got
in
that
vault
now
with
or
without
his
consent
you
better
run
along
and
get
dressed
while
i
take
him
up
to
the
instrument
room
why
move
him
kerim
asked
the
instrument
room
got
an
overall
safety
field
i
turned
it
on
now
and
if
something
starts
banging
us
around
again
the
room
will
be
the
safest
place
on
the
ship
i
bring
his
personal
luggage
up
too
and
you
can
start
looking
through
it
for
the
keys
you
may
find
them
before
i
get
a
new
set
made
or
he
may
wake
up
and
tell
us
where
they
are
kerim
ruse
gave
her
employer
a
dubious
glance
then
nodded
said
i
imagine
you
right
gefty
and
pattered
hurriedly
out
of
the
stateroom
a
few
minutes
later
she
arrived
fully
dressed
in
the
instrument
room
gefty
looked
around
from
the
where
he
had
laid
out
his
tools
and
said
he
has
stirred
his
suitcases
are
over
there
i
unlocked
them
kerim
gazed
at
what
showed
in
the
screens
about
the
control
console
and
shivered
slightly
she
said
i
was
thinking
gefty
is
there
something
they
call
space
three
illustration
sure
pseudospace
but
that
is
where
we
are
there
some
navy
tubs
that
can
operate
in
that
stuff
if
they
stay
too
long
a
ship
like
the
well
you
and
i
and
everything
else
in
here
would
be
frozen
solid
by
now
if
we
got
sucked
somehow
into
space
three
i
see
kerim
said
uncomfortably
gefty
heard
her
move
over
to
the
suitcases
after
a
moment
she
asked
what
do
the
vault
keys
look
like
you
ca
miss
them
if
he
just
thrown
them
in
there
they
over
six
inches
long
what
kind
of
a
guy
is
this
maulbow
a
scientist
i
could
say
gefty
he
never
referred
to
himself
as
a
scientist
i
had
this
job
a
year
and
a
half
maulbow
is
a
very
considerate
employer
one
of
the
nicest
men
i
known
really
but
it
was
simply
understood
that
i
should
ask
no
questions
about
the
business
beyond
what
i
actually
needed
to
know
for
my
work
what
the
business
called
maulbow
engineering
big
help
gefty
observed
somewhat
sourly
those
instruments
he
brought
along
he
build
those
himself
no
but
i
think
he
designed
some
of
them
probably
most
of
them
the
companies
he
had
doing
the
actual
work
appeared
to
have
a
terrible
time
getting
everything
exactly
the
way
maulbow
wanted
it
nothing
that
looks
like
a
set
of
keys
in
those
first
two
suitcases
gefty
well
gefty
said
if
you
do
find
them
in
the
others
you
might
start
thumping
around
to
see
if
he
got
secret
compartments
in
his
luggage
somewhere
i
do
wish
kerim
ruse
said
uneasily
that
maulbow
would
regain
consciousness
it
seems
so
so
underhanded
to
be
doing
these
things
behind
his
back
gefty
grunted
noncommittally
he
was
at
all
certain
by
now
that
he
wanted
his
secretive
client
to
wake
up
before
he
checked
on
the
contents
of
the
storage
vault
fifteen
minutes
later
gefty
rammer
was
climbing
down
to
the
storage
deck
in
the
broad
stern
the
newly
fashioned
set
of
vault
keys
clanking
heavily
in
his
coat
pocket
kerim
had
remained
with
her
employer
who
was
getting
back
his
color
but
still
had
opened
his
eyes
she
had
found
the
original
keys
gefty
was
sure
she
tried
too
hard
though
she
seemed
to
realize
the
seriousness
of
the
situation
now
but
her
loyalty
to
maulbow
could
make
no
further
difference
and
she
probably
felt
more
comfortable
for
it
lights
went
on
automatically
in
the
wide
passage
leading
from
the
cargo
lock
to
the
vault
as
gefty
turned
into
it
his
steps
echoed
between
the
steel
bulkheads
on
either
side
he
paused
a
moment
before
the
big
circular
vault
doors
listening
to
the
purr
of
the
idling
engines
in
the
next
compartment
the
familiar
sound
was
somehow
reassuring
he
inserted
the
first
key
turned
it
over
twice
drew
it
out
again
and
pressed
one
of
the
buttons
in
the
control
panel
beside
the
door
the
heavy
slab
of
steel
moved
sideways
with
a
soft
hissing
sound
vanished
into
the
wall
gefty
slid
the
other
key
into
the
lock
of
the
inner
door
a
few
seconds
later
the
vault
entrance
lay
open
before
him
he
stood
still
again
wrinkling
his
nose
the
area
ahead
was
only
dimly
illuminated
the
the
had
undergone
had
disturbed
the
lighting
system
here
and
what
was
that
odor
rather
sharp
unpleasant
it
might
have
been
spilled
ammonia
gefty
stepped
through
the
door
into
the
wide
short
entrance
passage
beyond
it
turned
to
the
right
and
peered
about
in
the
semidarkness
of
the
vault
two
great
steel
cases
the
ones
maulbow
had
taken
down
to
an
airless
moon
surface
loaded
up
with
something
and
brought
back
to
the
were
jammed
awkwardly
into
a
corner
in
a
manner
which
suggested
they
slid
into
it
when
the
ship
was
being
knocked
around
one
of
them
was
open
and
appeared
to
be
empty
gefty
was
sure
of
the
other
in
the
dimness
beside
them
lay
the
loose
coils
of
some
very
thick
dark
cable
and
standing
near
the
center
of
the
floor
was
a
thing
that
at
once
riveted
his
attention
on
it
completely
he
sucked
his
breath
in
softly
feeling
chilled
he
realized
he
had
really
believed
his
own
hunch
but
of
course
if
it
had
been
an
outside
force
that
plucked
the
out
of
normspace
and
threw
her
into
this
elsewhere
then
it
must
be
something
maulbow
had
put
on
board
and
that
something
had
to
be
a
machine
of
some
kind
it
was
about
it
he
could
make
out
a
thin
gleaming
of
wires
a
safety
field
within
the
protective
cage
was
a
double
bank
of
instruments
some
of
them
alive
with
the
flicker
and
glow
of
lights
those
must
be
the
very
expensive
and
items
maulbow
had
brought
out
from
the
hub
beside
them
stood
the
machine
squat
and
ponderous
in
the
vague
light
it
looked
misshaped
and
discolored
a
piece
of
equipment
that
had
taken
a
bad
beating
of
some
kind
but
it
was
functioning
as
he
stared
intermittent
bursts
of
clicking
noises
rose
from
it
like
the
staccato
of
irregular
gunfire
for
a
moment
questions
raced
in
disorder
through
his
mind
what
was
it
why
had
it
been
on
that
moon
part
of
another
ship
wrecked
now
a
ship
that
had
been
at
home
was
it
some
sort
of
drive
maulbow
must
know
he
known
enough
to
design
the
instruments
required
to
bring
the
battered
monster
back
to
life
on
the
other
hand
he
had
not
foreseen
in
all
detail
what
could
happen
once
the
thing
was
in
operation
because
the
sudden
act
had
surprised
him
and
knocked
him
out
the
first
step
in
any
event
was
to
get
maulbow
awake
now
to
tamper
with
a
device
like
this
before
learning
as
much
as
one
could
about
it
would
be
lunatic
foolhardiness
it
looked
like
too
good
a
bet
that
the
next
serious
mistake
made
by
anybody
would
finish
them
all
perhaps
it
was
only
because
gefty
nerves
were
on
edge
that
he
grew
aware
at
that
point
in
his
reflections
of
two
minor
signals
from
his
senses
one
was
that
the
smell
of
ammonia
which
he
had
almost
stopped
noticing
was
becoming
appreciably
stronger
the
other
was
the
faintest
of
sounds
a
whispering
suggestion
of
motion
somewhere
behind
him
but
here
in
the
storage
vault
nothing
should
have
moved
and
gefty
muscles
were
tensing
as
his
head
came
around
almost
in
the
same
instant
he
flung
himself
wildly
to
one
side
stumbling
and
regaining
his
balance
as
something
big
and
dark
slapped
heavily
down
on
the
floor
at
the
point
where
he
had
stood
then
he
was
darting
up
through
the
entrance
passage
turning
and
knocking
down
the
lock
switches
on
the
outside
door
panel
it
came
flowing
around
the
corner
of
the
passage
behind
him
as
the
vault
doors
began
to
slide
together
he
was
aware
mainly
of
swift
smooth
oiling
motion
like
that
of
a
big
snake
then
for
a
fraction
of
a
second
a
strip
of
brighter
light
from
the
outside
passage
showed
a
long
heavy
wedge
of
a
head
a
green
of
staring
eyes
the
doors
closed
silently
into
their
frames
and
locked
the
thing
was
inside
but
it
was
almost
a
minute
then
before
gefty
could
control
his
shaking
legs
enough
to
start
moving
back
towards
the
main
deck
in
the
of
the
vault
it
had
looked
like
a
big
coiled
cable
lying
next
to
the
packing
cases
like
maulbow
it
might
have
been
battered
around
and
knocked
out
during
the
recent
disturbance
and
when
it
recovered
it
had
found
gefty
in
the
vault
with
it
but
it
might
also
have
been
awake
all
the
while
waiting
cunningly
until
gefty
attention
seemed
fixed
elsewhere
before
launching
its
attack
it
was
big
enough
to
have
flattened
him
and
smashed
every
bone
in
his
body
if
the
stroke
had
landed
some
kind
of
guard
animal
a
snakelike
watchdog
what
other
connection
could
it
have
with
the
mystery
machine
perhaps
maulbow
had
intended
to
leave
it
confined
in
one
of
the
cases
and
it
had
broken
loose
too
many
questions
by
now
gefty
thought
but
maulbow
had
the
answers
he
was
hurrying
up
the
main
deck
central
passage
when
maulbow
voice
addressed
him
sharply
from
a
door
he
just
passed
stop
right
there
rammer
do
dare
to
move
i
the
voice
ended
on
a
note
of
surprise
gefty
reaction
had
not
been
too
rational
but
it
was
prompt
maulbow
tone
and
phrasing
implied
he
was
armed
gefty
was
but
he
kept
a
gun
in
the
instrument
room
for
emergencies
he
been
through
a
whole
series
of
unnerving
experiences
winding
up
with
being
shagged
out
of
his
storage
vault
by
something
that
stank
of
ammonia
and
looked
like
a
giant
snake
to
have
one
of
the
passengers
order
him
to
stand
where
he
was
topped
it
off
every
other
consideration
was
swept
aside
by
a
great
urge
to
get
his
hands
on
his
gun
he
glanced
back
saw
maulbow
coming
out
of
the
door
something
like
a
thin
white
rod
in
one
hand
then
gefty
went
bounding
on
along
the
passage
hunched
forward
and
zigzagging
from
wall
to
wall
to
give
maulbow
if
the
thing
he
held
was
a
weapon
and
he
actually
intended
to
use
it
as
small
and
erratic
a
target
as
possible
maulbow
shouted
angrily
behind
him
then
as
gefty
came
up
to
the
next
a
line
of
white
fire
seared
through
the
air
across
his
shoulders
and
smashed
off
the
passage
wall
with
that
he
was
around
the
corner
and
boiling
mad
he
had
no
great
liking
for
gunfire
but
it
did
shake
him
like
the
silently
attacking
beast
in
the
dark
storage
had
done
he
reached
the
deserted
instrument
room
not
many
seconds
later
had
his
gun
out
and
cocked
and
was
faced
back
towards
the
passage
by
which
he
had
entered
maulbow
if
he
had
pursued
without
hesitation
should
be
arriving
by
now
but
the
passage
stayed
quiet
gefty
could
see
into
it
from
where
he
stood
he
waited
trying
to
steady
his
breathing
wondering
where
kerim
ruse
was
and
what
had
got
into
maulbow
after
a
moment
without
taking
his
eyes
from
the
passage
entrance
he
reached
into
the
wall
closet
from
which
he
had
taken
the
gun
and
fished
out
another
souvenir
of
his
active
service
days
a
knife
in
a
gefty
worked
the
fastenings
of
the
sheath
over
his
left
wrist
and
up
his
forearm
under
his
coat
tested
the
release
to
make
sure
it
was
functioning
and
shook
his
coat
sleeve
back
into
place
the
passage
was
still
quiet
gefty
moved
softly
over
to
one
of
the
chairs
took
a
small
cushion
from
it
and
pitched
it
out
in
front
of
the
entrance
there
was
a
hiss
the
cushion
turned
in
midair
into
a
puff
of
bright
white
fire
gefty
aimed
his
gun
high
at
the
far
passage
wall
just
beyond
the
entrance
and
pulled
the
trigger
it
was
a
projectile
gun
he
heard
the
slug
screech
off
the
slick
plastic
bulkhead
and
go
slamming
down
the
passage
somebody
out
there
made
a
startled
incoherent
noise
but
not
the
kind
of
a
noise
a
man
makes
when
he
just
been
hit
if
you
come
in
here
armed
gefty
called
i
blow
your
head
off
want
to
stop
this
nonsense
now
there
was
a
moment
silence
then
maulbow
voice
replied
shakily
from
the
passage
he
seemed
to
be
standing
about
twenty
feet
back
from
the
room
if
you
end
your
thoughtless
attempts
at
interference
rammer
he
said
there
will
be
no
trouble
he
was
speaking
with
the
restraint
of
a
man
who
is
in
a
state
of
cold
fury
you
endangering
us
all
you
must
realize
that
you
have
no
understanding
of
what
you
are
doing
well
the
last
could
be
true
enough
we
talk
about
it
gefty
said
without
friendliness
i
have
done
anything
yet
but
i
not
just
handing
the
ship
over
to
you
and
what
have
you
done
with
miss
ruse
maulbow
hesitated
again
she
in
the
map
room
he
said
then
i
it
was
necessary
to
restrict
her
movements
for
a
while
but
you
might
as
well
let
her
out
now
we
must
reach
an
agreement
without
loss
of
time
gefty
glanced
over
his
shoulder
at
the
small
closed
door
of
the
map
room
there
was
no
lock
on
the
door
and
he
had
heard
no
sound
from
inside
this
might
be
some
trick
but
it
would
take
long
to
find
out
he
backed
up
to
the
wall
pushed
the
door
open
and
looked
inside
kerim
was
there
sitting
on
a
chair
in
one
corner
of
the
tiny
room
the
reason
she
had
made
any
noise
became
clear
she
and
the
chair
were
covered
by
a
rather
closely
fitting
sack
of
transparent
glistening
fabric
she
stared
out
through
it
despairingly
at
gefty
her
lips
moving
urgently
but
no
sound
came
from
the
sack
gefty
called
angrily
maulbow
do
excite
yourself
rammer
there
was
a
suggestion
of
what
might
be
contempt
in
maulbow
tone
now
the
girl
has
been
harmed
she
can
breathe
easily
through
the
restrainer
and
you
can
remove
it
by
pulling
at
the
material
from
outside
gefty
mouth
tightened
i
keep
my
gun
on
the
passage
while
i
do
it
maulbow
did
answer
gefty
edged
back
into
the
map
room
tentatively
grasped
the
transparent
stuff
above
kerim
shoulder
to
his
surprise
it
parted
like
wet
tissue
he
pulled
sharply
and
in
a
moment
kerim
came
peeling
herself
out
of
it
her
face
working
desperately
with
hands
elbows
and
shoulders
gefty
she
gasped
he
maulbow
he
out
in
the
passage
there
gefty
said
he
can
hear
you
his
glance
shifted
for
an
instant
to
the
wall
where
a
second
of
the
shroudlike
transparencies
was
hanging
and
who
could
that
have
been
intended
for
he
thought
but
gefty
rammer
he
added
we
had
a
little
trouble
oh
she
looked
out
of
the
room
towards
the
passage
then
at
the
gun
in
gefty
hand
then
up
at
his
face
maulbow
gefty
went
on
speaking
distinctly
enough
to
make
sure
maulbow
heard
has
a
gun
too
he
stay
there
in
the
passage
and
we
stay
in
the
instrument
room
until
we
agree
on
what
should
be
done
he
responsible
for
what
happened
and
seems
to
know
where
we
are
he
looked
at
kerim
frightened
eyes
dropped
his
voice
to
a
whisper
do
let
this
worry
you
too
much
i
have
found
out
just
what
up
to
but
so
far
his
tricks
have
pretty
much
backfired
he
was
counting
on
taking
us
both
by
surprise
for
one
thing
that
did
work
so
now
he
like
us
to
are
you
going
to
gefty
shrugged
depends
on
what
he
has
in
mind
i
just
interested
in
getting
us
out
of
this
alive
let
hear
what
maulbow
has
to
say
some
minutes
later
gefty
was
trying
to
decide
whether
it
was
taking
a
worse
risk
to
believe
what
maulbow
said
than
to
keep
things
stalled
on
the
chance
that
he
was
lying
kerim
ruse
perched
stiffly
erect
on
the
edge
of
a
chair
eyes
big
and
round
face
almost
colorless
apparently
believed
maulbow
and
was
wishing
she
did
there
was
of
course
some
supporting
evidence
primarily
the
improbable
appearance
of
their
surroundings
the
and
the
restrainer
had
a
sufficiently
unfamiliar
air
to
go
with
maulbow
story
but
as
far
as
gefty
knew
either
of
them
could
have
been
manufactured
in
the
hub
then
there
was
the
janandra
the
big
snakish
thing
in
the
storage
which
maulbow
had
brought
back
up
from
the
moon
along
with
the
battered
machine
it
had
been
he
said
his
shipboard
companion
on
another
voyage
it
was
ordinarily
aggressive
gefty
sudden
appearance
in
the
vault
must
have
startled
it
into
making
an
attack
it
was
not
exactly
a
pet
there
was
a
psychological
relationship
between
it
and
maulbow
which
maulbow
would
not
attempt
to
explain
because
gefty
and
kerim
would
be
unable
to
grasp
its
significance
the
janandra
was
essential
in
this
unexplained
manner
to
his
that
item
was
almost
curious
enough
to
seem
to
substantiate
his
other
statements
but
it
did
really
prove
anything
the
only
point
gefty
did
question
in
the
least
was
that
they
were
in
a
bad
spot
which
might
be
getting
worse
rapidly
his
gaze
shifted
back
to
the
screens
what
he
saw
out
there
surrounding
the
ship
was
according
to
maulbow
an
illusion
of
space
created
by
the
time
flow
in
which
they
were
moving
also
according
to
maulbow
there
was
a
race
of
the
future
human
in
appearance
with
machines
to
sail
the
current
of
time
through
the
universe
to
run
and
tack
with
the
winds
of
time
dipping
in
and
out
of
the
normspace
of
distant
periods
and
galaxies
as
they
chose
maulbow
one
of
the
explorers
had
met
disaster
a
million
from
the
home
of
his
kind
centuries
behind
them
his
vehicle
wrecked
on
an
airless
moon
with
damaged
control
unit
and
shattered
instruments
he
had
made
his
way
to
a
human
civilization
to
obtain
the
equipment
he
needed
and
returned
at
last
with
the
to
where
the
lay
buried
gefty
lip
curled
no
he
was
buying
all
that
just
yet
but
if
maulbow
was
lying
then
the
unseen
stars
were
racing
past
the
mass
of
the
galaxy
beginning
to
slide
by
eventually
to
be
lost
forever
beyond
a
black
distance
no
space
drive
could
span
the
matter
simply
had
to
be
settled
quickly
but
maulbow
was
also
strained
and
impatient
and
if
his
impatience
could
be
increased
a
little
more
he
might
start
telling
the
things
that
really
mattered
the
things
gefty
had
to
know
gefty
asked
slowly
as
if
hesitant
to
commit
himself
why
did
you
bring
us
along
the
voice
from
the
passage
snapped
because
my
resources
were
nearly
exhausted
rammer
i
could
obtain
a
new
ship
therefore
i
chartered
yours
and
you
came
with
it
as
for
miss
ruse
in
spite
of
every
precaution
my
activities
may
have
aroused
suspicion
and
curiosity
among
your
people
when
i
disappeared
miss
ruse
might
have
been
questioned
i
could
risk
being
followed
to
the
wreck
of
the
sailer
so
i
took
her
with
me
and
what
does
that
mean
against
what
i
have
offered
you
the
greatest
adventure
followed
i
give
you
my
solemn
word
by
a
safe
return
to
your
own
place
and
time
and
the
most
generous
compensations
for
any
inconvenience
you
may
have
suffered
kerim
looking
up
at
gefty
shook
her
head
violently
gefty
said
we
find
it
difficult
to
take
you
on
trust
now
maulbow
why
do
you
want
to
get
into
the
instrument
room
maulbow
was
silent
for
some
seconds
then
he
said
as
i
told
you
this
ship
would
not
have
been
buffeted
about
during
the
moments
of
transfer
if
the
control
unit
were
operating
with
complete
efficiency
certain
adjustments
will
have
to
be
made
in
the
unit
and
this
should
be
done
promptly
where
do
the
ship
instruments
come
in
gefty
asked
i
can
determine
the
nature
of
the
problem
from
them
when
i
was
stranded
the
unit
was
seriously
damaged
my
recent
repairs
were
necessarily
hasty
i
illustration
what
caused
the
maulbow
said
tone
taut
with
impatience
certain
sections
of
the
great
current
are
infested
with
dangerous
forces
i
shall
not
attempt
to
describe
them
i
would
get
it
i
do
pretend
to
understand
them
very
well
myself
rammer
they
are
not
life
but
show
characteristics
of
life
even
of
intelligent
life
if
you
can
imagine
radiant
energy
being
capable
of
conscious
hostility
there
was
a
chill
at
the
back
of
gefty
neck
a
big
light
yes
sharp
concern
showed
suddenly
in
the
voice
from
the
passage
you
when
did
you
see
that
gefty
glanced
at
the
screens
twice
since
you
been
talking
and
once
before
immediately
after
we
got
tumbled
around
then
we
can
waste
no
more
time
rammer
those
forces
are
sensitive
to
the
fluctuations
of
the
control
unit
if
they
were
close
enough
to
be
seen
they
aware
the
ship
is
here
they
were
attempting
to
locate
it
what
could
they
do
maulbow
said
a
single
attack
was
enough
to
put
the
control
unit
out
of
operation
in
my
sailer
the
great
current
then
rejected
us
instantly
a
ship
of
this
size
might
afford
more
protection
which
is
the
reason
i
chose
it
but
if
the
control
unit
is
not
adjusted
immediately
to
enable
it
to
take
us
out
of
this
section
the
attacks
will
continue
until
the
ship
and
we
have
been
destroyed
gefty
drew
a
deep
breath
there
another
solution
to
that
problem
maulbow
miss
ruse
and
i
prefer
it
and
if
you
meant
what
you
said
that
you
see
to
it
we
got
back
eventually
you
should
object
either
the
voice
asked
sharply
what
do
you
mean
gefty
said
shut
the
control
unit
off
from
what
you
were
saying
that
throws
us
automatically
back
into
normspace
while
we
still
close
enough
to
the
hub
you
find
plenty
of
people
there
who
stake
you
to
a
trip
to
the
future
if
they
can
go
along
and
are
convinced
return
miss
ruse
and
i
do
happen
to
be
that
adventurous
there
was
silence
from
the
passage
gefty
added
take
your
time
to
make
up
your
mind
about
it
if
you
want
to
i
do
like
the
idea
of
those
lights
hitting
us
but
neither
do
you
and
i
think
i
can
wait
this
out
as
well
as
you
can
the
silence
stretched
out
presently
gefty
said
if
you
do
accept
slide
that
device
of
yours
into
the
room
before
you
show
up
we
do
want
accidents
he
paused
again
kerim
was
chewing
her
lips
hands
clenched
into
small
fists
in
her
lap
then
maulbow
answered
voice
flat
and
expressionless
now
the
worst
thing
we
can
do
at
present
he
said
is
to
prolong
a
dispute
about
possible
courses
of
action
if
i
disarm
will
you
lay
aside
your
gun
yes
then
i
accept
your
conditions
disappointing
as
they
are
he
was
silent
after
a
moment
gefty
heard
the
white
rod
clatter
lightly
along
the
floor
of
the
passage
it
struck
the
passage
wall
spun
off
it
and
rolled
into
the
instrument
room
coming
to
rest
a
few
feet
away
from
him
gefty
hesitated
picked
it
up
and
laid
it
on
the
wall
table
he
placed
his
own
gun
beside
it
moved
a
dozen
steps
away
kerim
eyes
followed
him
anxiously
gefty
she
whispered
he
might
gefty
looked
at
her
formed
the
words
it
all
right
with
his
mouth
and
called
guns
have
been
put
aside
maulbow
come
on
in
and
keep
it
peaceable
he
waited
arms
hanging
loosely
at
his
side
heart
beating
heavily
as
quick
footsteps
came
up
the
passage
maulbow
appeared
in
the
entrance
glanced
at
gefty
and
kerim
then
about
the
room
his
gaze
rested
for
a
moment
on
the
wall
table
shifted
back
to
gefty
maulbow
came
on
into
the
room
turning
towards
gefty
mouth
twisting
he
said
softly
it
is
not
our
practice
rammer
to
share
the
secrets
of
the
great
current
with
other
races
i
had
foreseen
that
you
might
become
a
dangerous
nuisance
but
now
his
right
hand
began
to
lift
half
closed
about
some
small
golden
instrument
gefty
left
arm
moved
back
and
quickly
forwards
the
service
knife
slid
out
of
its
sheath
and
up
from
his
palm
as
an
arrow
of
smoky
blackness
burst
from
the
thing
in
maulbow
hand
the
blackness
came
racing
with
a
thin
snarling
noise
across
the
floor
towards
gefty
feet
the
knife
flashed
above
it
turning
and
stood
in
maulbow
chest
gefty
returned
a
few
minutes
later
from
the
forward
cabin
which
served
as
the
sick
bay
and
said
to
kerim
he
still
alive
though
i
do
know
why
he
may
even
recover
he
full
of
anesthetic
and
that
should
keep
him
quiet
till
we
back
in
normspace
then
i
see
what
we
can
do
for
him
kerim
had
lost
some
of
her
white
shocked
look
while
he
was
gone
you
knew
he
would
try
to
kill
you
she
asked
shakily
suspected
he
had
it
in
mind
he
gave
in
too
quick
but
i
thought
have
a
chance
to
take
any
gadget
he
was
hiding
away
from
him
first
i
was
wrong
about
that
now
we
better
move
fast
he
switched
the
emergency
check
panel
back
on
glanced
over
the
familiar
patterns
of
lights
and
numbers
a
few
minor
damage
spots
were
indicated
but
the
ship
was
still
fully
operational
one
minor
damage
spot
which
did
not
appear
on
the
panel
was
now
to
be
found
in
the
instrument
room
itself
in
the
corner
on
which
the
door
of
the
map
room
opened
the
door
the
adjoining
bulkheads
and
section
of
flooring
were
scarred
blackened
and
as
assortedly
malodorous
as
burned
things
tend
to
become
that
was
where
gefty
had
stood
when
maulbow
entered
the
room
and
if
he
had
remained
there
an
instant
after
letting
go
of
the
knife
he
would
have
been
in
very
much
worse
condition
than
the
essentially
fireproof
furnishings
both
maulbow
weapons
the
white
rod
lying
innocently
on
the
wall
table
and
the
round
golden
device
which
had
dropped
from
his
hand
spitting
darts
of
smoking
blackness
had
blasted
unnervingly
away
into
that
area
for
almost
thirty
seconds
after
maulbow
was
down
and
twisting
about
on
the
floor
then
he
went
limp
and
the
firing
instantly
stopped
apparently
maulbow
control
of
them
had
ended
as
he
lost
consciousness
it
seemed
fortunate
that
the
sick
bay
cabin
emergency
treatment
accessories
gentle
as
their
action
was
might
have
been
designed
for
the
specific
purpose
of
keeping
the
most
violent
of
prisoners
immobilized
let
alone
one
with
a
terrible
knife
wound
in
him
at
the
angle
along
which
the
knife
had
driven
in
and
up
below
the
ribs
an
ordinary
man
would
have
been
dead
in
seconds
but
it
was
very
evident
now
that
maulbow
was
no
ordinary
man
and
even
after
the
eerie
weapons
had
been
pitched
out
of
the
ship
through
the
instrument
room
disposal
tube
gefty
could
rid
himself
of
an
uncomfortable
suspicion
that
he
was
done
with
maulbow
yet
would
be
done
with
him
in
fact
until
one
or
the
other
of
them
was
dead
he
said
to
kerim
i
thought
the
machine
maulbow
set
up
in
the
storage
vault
would
turn
out
to
be
some
drive
engine
but
apparently
it
has
an
entirely
different
function
he
connected
it
with
the
instruments
he
had
made
in
the
hub
and
together
they
form
what
he
calls
a
control
unit
the
emergency
panel
would
show
if
the
unit
were
drawing
juice
from
the
ship
it
is
and
i
do
know
what
powers
it
but
we
do
know
now
that
the
control
unit
is
holding
us
in
the
time
current
and
it
will
go
on
holding
us
there
as
long
as
it
in
operation
if
we
could
shut
it
off
the
would
be
by
the
current
like
maulbow
sailer
was
in
other
words
we
get
knocked
back
into
normspace
which
is
what
we
want
and
we
want
it
to
happen
as
soon
as
possible
because
if
maulbow
was
telling
the
truth
on
that
point
every
minute
that
passes
here
is
taking
us
farther
away
from
the
hub
and
farther
from
our
own
time
towards
his
kerim
nodded
eyes
intent
on
his
face
now
i
ca
just
go
down
there
and
start
slapping
switches
around
on
the
thing
gefty
went
on
he
said
it
was
working
right
and
even
if
it
were
i
could
tell
what
would
happen
but
it
does
seem
to
connect
up
with
any
ship
systems
it
just
seems
to
be
holding
us
in
a
field
of
its
own
so
i
should
be
able
to
move
the
whole
unit
into
the
cargo
lock
and
eject
it
from
there
if
we
shift
the
outside
its
field
that
should
have
the
same
effect
as
shutting
the
control
unit
off
it
should
throw
us
back
into
normspace
kerim
nodded
again
what
about
maulbow
janandra
animal
gefty
shrugged
depends
on
the
mood
i
find
it
in
he
said
it
usually
aggressive
maybe
it
is
i
get
into
a
spacesuit
for
protection
and
break
out
some
of
the
mining
equipment
to
move
it
along
with
if
i
can
maneuver
it
into
an
empty
compartment
where
it
will
be
out
of
the
he
broke
off
expression
changing
eyes
fastened
on
the
emergency
panel
then
he
turned
hurriedly
reached
across
the
side
of
the
console
for
the
intership
airseal
controls
kerim
asked
apprehensively
what
the
matter
gefty
wish
i
knew
exactly
gefty
indicated
the
emergency
panel
little
red
light
there
on
the
storage
deck
section
it
was
showing
a
minute
ago
it
means
that
the
vault
doors
have
been
opened
since
then
he
saw
the
same
fear
appear
in
her
face
that
had
touched
him
you
think
did
it
i
do
know
maulbow
control
of
the
guns
had
seemed
uncanny
enough
but
that
was
a
different
matter
the
guns
were
a
product
of
his
own
time
and
science
but
the
vault
door
mechanisms
there
might
have
been
sufficient
opportunity
for
maulbow
to
study
them
and
alter
them
for
some
purpose
of
his
own
since
he
come
aboard
i
got
the
ship
compartments
and
decks
sealed
off
from
each
other
now
gefty
said
slowly
the
only
connecting
points
from
one
to
the
other
are
personnel
hatches
they
small
air
locks
so
the
confined
to
the
storage
deck
if
it
come
out
of
the
vault
it
might
be
a
nuisance
until
i
can
get
equipment
to
handle
it
but
that
is
too
serious
the
spacesuits
are
on
the
second
deck
and
i
get
into
one
before
i
go
on
to
the
storage
you
wait
here
a
moment
i
look
in
on
maulbow
again
before
i
start
if
maulbow
was
still
unconscious
he
was
doing
a
good
job
of
feigning
it
gefty
looked
at
the
pale
lax
face
the
eyes
shook
his
head
and
left
the
cabin
locking
it
behind
him
it
might
be
doing
but
having
the
big
snake
loose
in
the
storage
could
in
fact
make
things
extremely
awkward
now
he
did
think
his
gun
would
make
much
impression
on
anything
of
that
size
and
while
several
of
the
ship
mining
tools
could
be
employed
as
very
effective
weapons
they
happened
unfortunately
to
be
stored
away
on
the
same
deck
he
found
kerim
standing
in
the
center
of
the
instrument
room
waiting
for
him
gefty
she
said
do
you
notice
anything
an
odd
sort
of
smell
then
the
odor
was
in
gefty
nostrils
too
and
the
back
of
his
neck
turned
to
ice
as
he
recognized
it
he
glanced
up
at
the
ventilation
outlet
looked
back
at
kerim
he
took
her
arm
said
softly
come
this
way
keep
very
quiet
i
know
how
it
happened
but
the
janandra
on
the
main
deck
now
what
it
smells
like
the
smell
coming
through
the
ventilation
system
so
the
thing
moving
around
in
the
port
section
we
go
the
other
way
kerim
whispered
what
will
we
do
get
ourselves
into
spacesuits
first
and
then
get
maulbow
control
unit
out
of
the
ship
the
janandra
may
be
looking
around
for
him
if
it
is
it
wo
bother
us
he
had
wanted
to
remind
kerim
that
from
what
maulbow
said
there
might
be
more
than
one
reason
for
getting
rid
of
the
control
unit
as
quickly
as
possible
but
it
had
been
constantly
in
the
back
of
his
mind
and
twice
in
the
few
minutes
that
passed
after
maulbow
strange
weapons
were
silenced
he
had
seen
a
momentary
pale
glare
appear
in
the
unquiet
flow
of
darkness
reflecting
in
the
viewscreens
gefty
had
said
nothing
because
if
it
was
true
that
hostile
forces
were
alert
and
searching
for
them
here
it
added
to
their
immediate
danger
but
not
at
all
to
the
absolute
need
to
free
themselves
from
the
inexorable
rush
of
the
great
current
before
they
were
carried
beyond
hope
of
return
to
their
civilization
but
those
brief
glimpses
did
add
to
the
sense
of
urgency
throbbing
in
gefty
nerves
while
events
and
the
equally
hard
necessity
to
avoid
a
fatally
mistaken
move
in
this
welter
of
unknown
factors
kept
blocking
him
now
the
mysterious
manner
in
which
maulbow
unpleasant
traveling
companion
had
appeared
on
the
main
deck
made
it
impossible
to
do
anything
but
keep
kerim
at
his
side
if
maulbow
was
still
capable
of
taking
a
hand
in
matters
there
was
no
reasonably
safe
place
to
leave
her
aboard
the
and
maulbow
might
be
capable
of
it
twice
as
they
hurried
up
the
narrow
angled
passages
along
the
curving
hull
towards
an
airseal
leading
to
the
next
compartment
gefty
caught
a
trace
of
the
animal
odor
coming
over
the
ventilating
system
they
reached
the
lock
without
incident
but
then
as
they
came
along
the
second
deck
hall
to
the
ship
magazine
there
was
a
sharp
click
in
the
stillness
behind
them
its
meaning
was
disconcertingly
apparent
gefty
hesitated
turned
kerim
into
a
side
passage
guided
her
along
it
she
looked
up
at
his
face
it
following
us
seems
to
be
no
time
for
the
spacesuits
in
the
magazine
now
something
had
just
emerged
from
the
air
lock
through
which
they
had
entered
the
second
deck
not
many
moments
before
he
helped
the
girl
quickly
down
a
section
of
ladderlike
stairs
to
the
airseal
connecting
the
second
deck
with
the
storage
punched
a
wall
button
there
as
the
lock
door
opened
there
was
another
noise
from
the
passage
they
had
just
left
as
if
something
had
thudded
briefly
and
heavily
against
one
of
the
bulkheads
kerim
uttered
a
little
gasp
then
they
were
in
the
lock
and
gefty
slapped
down
two
other
buttons
stood
watching
the
door
behind
them
snap
shut
and
a
few
seconds
later
the
one
on
the
far
side
open
on
the
dark
storage
deck
they
scrambled
down
another
twelve
feet
of
ladder
to
the
floor
of
a
side
passage
hearing
the
lock
snap
shut
behind
them
as
it
closed
they
were
in
complete
darkness
gefty
seized
kerim
arm
ran
with
her
up
the
passage
to
the
left
guiding
himself
with
his
fingertips
on
the
left
bulkhead
when
they
came
to
a
corner
he
turned
her
to
the
left
again
a
few
seconds
later
he
pulled
open
a
small
door
bundled
the
girl
through
came
in
himself
and
shut
the
door
to
a
narrow
slit
behind
them
kerim
whispered
shakily
what
will
we
do
now
gefty
stay
here
for
the
moment
it
look
for
us
in
the
vault
first
and
it
should
go
to
the
storage
vault
first
where
it
had
been
guarding
maulbow
machine
to
hunt
for
them
there
but
it
might
not
gefty
eased
the
gun
from
his
pocket
on
the
far
side
of
kerim
across
the
dark
compartment
was
another
door
they
could
retreat
a
little
farther
here
if
it
became
necessary
but
not
very
much
farther
they
waited
in
a
silence
that
was
complete
except
for
their
unsteady
breathing
and
the
distant
deep
pulse
of
the
drives
he
felt
kerim
trembling
against
him
how
did
maulbow
creature
move
through
the
airseal
locks
the
operating
mechanisms
were
simple
a
dog
might
have
been
taught
to
use
them
but
a
dog
had
paws
there
came
the
soft
hiss
of
the
opening
lock
the
faintest
shimmer
of
light
to
the
right
of
the
passage
mouth
he
was
watching
through
the
door
a
heavy
thump
on
the
floor
below
the
locks
followed
then
a
hard
click
as
the
lock
closed
and
complete
darkness
returned
the
silence
resumed
seconds
dragged
on
gefty
imagination
pictured
the
thing
waiting
its
great
head
raised
as
its
senses
probed
the
dark
about
it
for
a
sign
of
the
two
human
beings
then
a
vague
rushing
noise
began
growing
louder
as
it
approached
the
passage
mouth
crossing
it
receding
rapidly
again
to
the
left
gefty
let
his
breath
out
slowly
eased
the
door
open
and
stood
listening
again
abruptly
there
was
reflected
light
in
the
lock
passage
coming
now
from
the
left
he
said
in
a
whisper
it
moving
around
in
the
main
hall
kerim
we
can
go
on
the
other
way
now
but
we
have
to
be
fast
and
keep
quiet
i
thought
of
how
we
can
get
rid
of
that
thing
the
cargo
lock
on
the
storage
deck
had
two
inner
doors
the
one
which
opened
into
the
side
of
the
vault
hall
was
built
to
allow
passage
of
the
largest
chunks
of
freight
the
was
likely
to
be
burdened
with
it
was
almost
thirty
feet
wide
and
twenty
high
the
second
door
was
just
large
enough
to
let
a
man
in
a
spacesuit
climb
in
and
out
of
the
side
of
the
lock
without
using
the
freight
door
it
opened
on
a
tiny
control
cubicle
from
which
the
lock
mechanisms
were
operated
during
loading
processes
illustration
gefty
let
kerim
and
himself
into
the
cubicle
from
one
of
the
passages
steered
the
girl
through
the
pitch
blackness
of
the
little
room
to
the
chair
before
the
control
panel
and
told
her
to
sit
down
he
groped
for
a
moment
at
the
side
of
the
panel
found
a
knob
and
twisted
it
there
was
a
faint
click
a
scattering
of
pale
lights
appeared
suddenly
on
the
panel
a
dark
viewscreen
set
at
a
tilt
above
them
reflecting
their
gleam
gefty
explained
in
a
low
voice
left
side
of
that
screen
covers
the
lock
right
one
covers
the
big
hall
outside
no
lights
in
either
at
the
moment
so
you
do
see
anything
only
way
the
cargo
door
to
the
hall
can
be
opened
or
closed
is
with
these
switches
right
here
what
i
want
to
do
is
get
the
janandra
into
the
lock
slam
the
door
on
it
and
lock
down
the
control
switches
then
we
got
it
trapped
but
how
are
you
going
to
get
it
to
go
in
there
no
real
problem
i
be
three
jumps
ahead
of
it
then
i
duck
back
up
into
this
cubicle
and
lock
both
doors
and
it
be
inside
the
lock
you
have
the
picture
now
kerim
said
unsteadily
i
do
but
it
sounds
awfully
risky
gefty
well
i
do
like
it
either
gefty
admitted
so
i
start
right
now
before
i
lose
my
nerve
as
soon
as
i
move
out
into
the
vault
hall
the
lighting
will
go
on
that
automatic
you
watch
the
right
side
of
the
screen
if
you
see
the
janandra
coming
before
i
do
yell
as
loud
as
you
can
he
shifted
the
two
inner
door
switches
to
the
right
a
red
spark
appeared
in
the
dark
viewscreen
high
up
near
the
center
a
second
red
light
showed
on
the
cubicle
bulkhead
beside
gefty
beneath
it
an
oblong
section
of
the
bulkhead
turned
silently
away
on
heavy
hinges
became
a
door
two
feet
in
thickness
which
stood
jutting
out
at
a
right
angle
into
the
darkness
of
the
cargo
lock
a
wave
of
cold
air
moved
through
it
into
the
control
cubicle
on
the
screen
another
red
spark
appeared
beside
the
first
one
both
doors
are
open
now
gefty
murmured
to
the
girl
the
janandra
is
in
the
vault
hall
or
the
lighting
would
have
turned
on
but
it
may
have
heard
the
door
open
and
be
on
its
way
so
keep
watching
the
screen
i
certainly
will
she
whispered
shakily
gefty
took
an
oversized
wrench
from
the
wall
climbed
quickly
and
quietly
down
the
three
ladder
steps
to
the
floor
of
the
lock
and
walked
across
it
to
the
sill
of
the
giant
freight
door
which
now
had
swung
out
and
down
into
the
vault
hall
fitting
itself
into
a
depression
of
the
flooring
he
hesitated
an
instant
on
the
sill
then
stepped
out
into
the
big
dark
hall
light
filled
it
immediately
in
both
directions
he
stood
quiet
intent
on
the
storage
vault
entrance
far
up
the
hall
to
his
left
he
could
see
the
vault
was
open
the
janandra
might
still
be
inside
it
but
the
seconds
passed
and
the
dark
entrance
remained
silent
and
there
was
no
suggestion
of
motion
beyond
it
gefty
glanced
to
the
right
moved
a
dozen
steps
farther
out
into
the
hall
hefted
the
wrench
and
spun
it
through
the
air
towards
the
ventilator
frame
on
the
opposite
bulkhead
the
heavy
tool
clanged
loudly
against
the
frame
bounced
off
and
thudded
to
the
floor
gefty
started
slowly
over
to
it
heart
pounding
with
the
vault
entrance
still
at
the
edge
of
his
vision
kerim
voice
screamed
he
spun
around
sprinted
back
to
the
cargo
lock
the
janandra
had
come
silently
out
of
the
nearest
side
passage
behind
him
was
approaching
with
the
remembered
oiling
swiftness
of
motion
its
great
head
lifted
a
yard
from
the
floor
gefty
plunged
through
the
lock
jumped
for
the
top
of
the
cubicle
door
steps
came
stumbling
into
the
cubicle
kerim
was
on
her
feet
staring
he
swung
the
cubicle
door
switch
to
the
left
slapping
it
flat
to
the
panel
the
door
snapped
back
into
the
wall
behind
him
with
a
force
that
shook
the
floor
on
the
screen
the
janandra
thick
dark
was
swinging
around
in
the
dim
lock
to
regain
the
open
hall
it
had
seen
the
trap
but
the
freight
door
switch
went
flat
beside
the
other
and
the
freight
door
rose
with
massive
swiftness
the
heavy
body
smashed
against
it
went
sliding
back
to
the
floor
as
the
door
slammed
shut
and
the
screen
section
showing
the
cargo
lock
turned
dark
got
it
got
it
got
it
gefty
heard
himself
whispering
exultantly
he
switched
on
the
lock
interior
lights
then
he
swore
softly
and
beside
him
kerim
sucked
in
her
breath
the
screen
showed
the
janandra
in
violent
but
apparently
purposeful
motion
inside
the
lock
and
it
was
also
apparent
now
that
it
was
a
more
complexly
constructed
creature
than
the
long
and
heavy
head
had
indicated
the
skin
to
a
distance
of
some
eight
feet
back
of
the
head
had
spread
out
into
a
wide
flexible
frill
from
beneath
the
frill
extended
half
a
dozen
jointed
arms
along
with
waving
ribbonlike
appendages
less
easy
to
define
the
thing
was
reared
half
up
along
the
hall
door
inspecting
its
surface
with
these
members
then
suddenly
it
flung
itself
around
and
flashed
over
to
the
outer
lock
door
three
arms
shot
out
wiry
fingers
caught
the
three
simultaneously
began
to
whirl
them
gefty
said
staring
kerim
it
going
to
the
janandra
did
the
motion
checked
suddenly
was
reversed
the
locks
drew
tight
again
the
janandra
swung
back
from
the
door
lifting
half
its
length
upwards
big
head
weaving
about
as
it
inspected
the
tool
racks
overhead
an
arm
reached
suddenly
snatched
something
from
one
of
the
racks
then
the
thing
turned
again
and
in
the
next
instant
its
head
filled
the
viewscreen
kerim
made
a
choked
sound
of
fright
jerking
back
against
gefty
the
bulging
eyes
seemed
to
stare
directly
at
him
and
the
screen
went
black
kerim
whispered
wha
what
happened
gefty
gefty
swallowed
said
it
smashed
the
view
pickup
must
have
guessed
we
were
watching
and
did
like
it
he
added
i
was
beginning
to
think
maulbow
must
be
some
kind
of
superman
but
it
was
any
magic
of
his
that
let
the
janandra
out
of
the
vault
and
opened
the
intership
locks
when
it
came
up
to
the
main
deck
and
followed
us
down
again
it
was
doing
all
that
for
itself
it
maulbow
partner
not
his
pet
and
it
probably
got
at
least
as
good
a
brain
as
anyone
else
on
board
behind
that
ugly
face
kerim
moistened
her
lips
can
it
could
it
get
out
again
into
the
ship
gefty
shook
his
head
decidedly
it
could
dump
itself
out
on
the
other
side
and
it
almost
did
before
it
realized
where
it
was
and
what
it
was
about
to
do
but
the
inner
lock
doors
wo
open
until
someone
opens
them
right
on
this
panel
no
the
thing
safely
trapped
on
the
other
hand
on
the
other
hand
gefty
realized
that
he
would
now
be
able
to
bring
himself
to
eject
the
janandra
out
of
the
cargo
lock
and
into
the
great
current
its
intentions
obviously
had
been
friendly
but
its
level
of
intelligence
was
as
good
as
his
own
and
perhaps
somewhat
better
and
at
present
it
was
helpless
to
dispose
of
it
as
he
had
in
mind
would
therefore
be
the
murder
of
an
equal
but
so
long
as
that
ugly
and
formidable
shipmate
of
maulbow
stayed
in
the
cargo
lock
the
lock
could
be
used
to
get
rid
of
the
control
unit
in
the
vault
a
new
solution
presented
itself
while
gefty
was
making
a
rapid
and
rather
desperate
mental
review
of
various
tools
which
might
be
employed
as
weapons
to
force
the
janandra
into
submission
and
haul
it
off
for
confinement
elsewhere
in
the
ship
not
impossible
but
a
highly
precarious
and
operation
at
best
then
another
thought
occurred
the
storage
vault
lay
directly
against
the
hull
of
the
how
long
to
cut
through
the
hull
the
ship
mining
equipment
was
on
board
and
the
tools
were
climb
into
a
spacesuit
empty
the
air
from
the
entire
storage
deck
leaving
the
janandra
imprisoned
in
the
cargo
lock
with
maulbow
incapacitated
in
sick
bay
and
kerim
back
in
the
control
compartment
and
also
in
a
suit
for
additional
protection
then
cut
ship
power
to
this
deck
to
avoid
complications
with
the
involved
circuitry
and
work
under
space
conditions
half
an
hour
if
he
hurried
should
take
more
than
another
ten
minutes
he
informed
kerim
presently
over
the
suit
intercom
i
very
glad
to
hear
it
gefty
she
sounded
shaky
anything
going
on
in
the
screens
he
asked
she
hesitated
a
little
said
no
not
at
the
moment
gefty
grunted
blinked
sweat
from
his
eyes
and
took
hold
of
the
handgrips
of
the
heavy
mining
cutter
again
turning
it
nose
down
towards
the
vault
floor
the
guide
light
found
the
point
he
was
working
on
and
the
slice
beam
stabbed
out
began
nibbling
delicately
away
to
extend
the
curving
line
it
had
eaten
through
the
thick
skin
he
had
drawn
a
foot
circle
around
maulbow
battered
control
unit
and
the
instruments
attached
to
it
well
outside
the
safety
field
the
circle
was
broken
at
four
points
where
he
would
plant
explosives
the
explosives
going
off
together
should
shatter
the
connecting
links
with
the
hull
and
throw
the
machine
clear
if
that
did
release
them
immediately
from
its
influence
he
would
see
what
putting
the
drives
into
action
would
do
gefty
kerim
voice
asked
he
could
hear
her
swallow
over
the
intercom
those
lights
are
back
now
how
many
two
kerim
said
i
they
only
two
they
keep
crossing
back
and
forth
in
front
of
us
she
laughed
nervously
it
idiotic
of
course
but
i
do
get
the
feeling
they
looking
at
us
gefty
said
hesitantly
everything
set
but
i
need
another
minute
or
two
to
get
this
last
connection
whittled
down
a
little
more
if
i
blow
the
charge
too
soon
it
might
take
the
gadget
clean
out
of
the
ship
kerim
said
i
know
i
just
watch
they
just
disappeared
again
her
voice
changed
now
there
something
else
what
that
you
know
you
said
to
watch
the
cargo
lock
lights
on
the
emergency
panel
yes
the
outer
lock
door
has
just
been
opened
what
it
must
have
been
the
light
started
blinking
red
just
now
as
i
was
looking
at
it
gefty
was
silent
a
moment
his
mind
racing
why
would
the
janandra
open
the
lock
from
what
maulbow
had
said
it
could
live
for
a
while
without
air
but
it
still
could
gain
nothing
but
eventual
death
from
leaving
the
ship
unless
gefty
thought
the
janandra
had
become
aware
in
some
way
that
he
was
about
to
blow
their
machine
out
of
the
there
were
grappling
lines
in
the
cargo
lock
and
if
four
or
five
of
those
lines
were
slapped
to
the
circular
section
of
the
hull
he
loosened
kerim
he
said
yes
i
going
to
blow
the
deal
right
now
got
your
suit
snapped
to
the
wall
braces
like
i
showed
you
yes
gefty
her
voice
was
faint
but
clear
he
turned
the
cutter
away
from
the
line
it
had
dug
sent
it
rolling
off
towards
the
far
wall
he
hurried
around
the
circle
checking
the
four
charges
lumbered
over
to
the
vault
passage
stopped
just
around
the
corner
he
took
the
firing
box
from
his
suit
ready
kerim
he
opened
the
box
ready
here
goes
gefty
reached
into
the
box
twisted
the
firing
handle
light
flared
in
the
vault
the
deck
shook
below
him
he
came
stumbling
out
from
behind
the
wall
maulbow
machine
and
its
stand
of
instruments
had
vanished
where
it
had
stood
was
a
dark
circular
hole
nothing
else
seemed
to
have
happened
gefty
clumped
hurriedly
over
to
the
mining
cutter
swung
it
around
started
more
cautiously
back
towards
the
hole
he
did
have
the
faintest
idea
what
would
come
next
but
a
definite
possibility
was
that
he
would
see
the
janandra
dark
form
flowing
up
over
the
rim
of
the
hole
letting
it
run
into
the
cutter
beam
might
be
the
best
way
to
discourage
it
from
the
illustration
instead
a
dazzling
brilliance
suddenly
blotted
out
everything
the
cutter
was
plucked
from
gefty
grasp
then
he
was
picked
up
suit
and
all
and
slammed
up
towards
the
vault
ceiling
he
had
a
feeling
that
inaudible
thunders
were
shaking
the
ship
he
seemed
to
be
rolling
over
and
over
along
the
ceiling
at
last
the
suit
crashed
into
something
which
showed
a
total
disinclination
to
yield
and
gefty
blacked
out
the
left
side
of
his
face
felt
pushed
out
of
shape
his
left
eye
functioning
too
well
and
there
was
a
severe
pulsing
ache
throughout
the
top
of
his
head
but
gefty
felt
happy
there
were
a
few
qualifying
considerations
of
course
he
pointed
out
to
kerim
all
we
can
really
say
immediately
is
that
we
back
in
normspace
and
somewhere
in
the
galaxy
she
smiled
shakily
is
that
saying
quite
a
lot
gefty
it
something
gefty
glanced
around
the
instrument
room
he
had
placed
an
emergency
light
on
the
console
but
except
for
that
the
control
compartment
was
in
darkness
the
renewed
battering
the
had
absorbed
had
knocked
out
the
power
in
the
forward
section
the
viewscreens
were
black
every
instrument
dead
but
he
seen
the
stars
of
normspace
through
the
torn
vault
floor
it
was
something
we
might
have
the
light
that
slugged
us
to
thank
for
that
he
said
i
not
sure
just
what
did
happen
there
but
it
could
have
been
maulbow
control
unit
it
was
attacking
rather
than
the
ship
maulbow
said
the
lights
were
sensitive
to
the
unit
at
any
rate
we
here
and
we
rid
of
the
gadget
and
of
the
janandra
he
hesitated
i
just
do
feel
you
should
get
your
hopes
too
high
we
may
find
out
we
a
very
long
way
from
the
hub
kerim
large
eyes
showed
a
degree
of
confidence
which
made
him
almost
uncomfortable
if
we
are
she
said
serenely
you
get
us
back
somehow
gefty
cleared
his
throat
well
we
see
if
the
power
shutoff
is
something
the
repair
scanners
can
handle
the
instruments
will
come
back
on
any
minute
give
the
scanners
ten
minutes
if
they
done
it
by
that
time
they
ca
do
it
and
i
have
to
play
repairman
then
with
the
instruments
working
we
can
determine
exactly
where
we
are
unless
he
told
himself
silently
they
wound
up
in
a
distant
cluster
never
penetrated
by
the
federation
mapping
teams
and
there
was
the
other
little
question
of
where
they
now
were
in
time
but
kerim
looked
rosy
with
relief
and
those
details
could
wait
he
took
up
another
emergency
light
switched
it
on
and
said
i
see
how
maulbow
is
doing
while
we
waiting
for
power
if
the
first
aid
treatment
has
pulled
him
through
so
far
the
autosurgeon
probably
can
fix
him
up
kerim
face
suddenly
took
on
a
guilty
expression
i
forgot
all
about
mr
maulbow
she
hesitated
should
i
come
along
gefty
shook
his
head
i
wo
need
help
and
if
it
a
case
for
the
surgeon
you
would
like
it
those
things
work
painlessly
but
it
gets
to
be
a
mess
for
a
while
he
shut
off
the
light
again
when
he
reached
the
sick
bay
which
was
running
on
its
independent
power
system
as
he
opened
the
cabin
door
from
the
dispensary
carrying
the
autosurgeon
it
became
evident
that
maulbow
was
still
alive
but
that
he
might
be
in
delirium
gefty
placed
the
surgeon
on
the
table
went
over
to
the
bed
and
looked
at
maulbow
to
the
extent
that
the
emergency
treatment
instruments
cautious
restraints
permitted
maulbow
was
twisting
slowly
about
on
the
bed
he
was
speaking
in
a
low
rapid
voice
his
face
distorted
by
emotion
the
words
were
not
slurred
but
they
were
in
a
language
gefty
did
know
it
seemed
clear
that
maulbow
had
reverted
mentally
to
his
own
time
and
for
some
seconds
he
remained
unaware
that
gefty
had
entered
the
room
then
surprisingly
the
slitted
blue
eyes
opened
wider
and
focused
on
gefty
face
and
maulbow
screamed
with
rage
gefty
felt
somewhat
disconcerted
for
the
reason
alone
that
he
was
under
anesthetic
maulbow
should
not
have
been
conscious
but
he
was
the
words
were
now
ones
gefty
could
understand
and
maulbow
was
telling
him
things
which
would
have
been
interesting
enough
under
different
circumstances
gefty
broke
in
as
soon
as
he
could
look
he
said
quietly
i
trying
to
help
you
i
maulbow
interrupted
him
in
turn
not
at
all
quietly
gefty
listened
a
moment
longer
then
shrugged
so
maulbow
did
like
him
he
say
honestly
that
he
ever
liked
maulbow
much
and
what
he
was
hearing
made
him
like
maulbow
considerably
less
but
he
would
keep
the
man
from
the
future
alive
if
he
could
he
positioned
the
autosurgeon
behind
the
head
of
the
bed
to
allow
the
device
to
begin
its
analysis
stood
back
at
its
controls
where
he
could
both
follow
the
progress
it
made
and
watch
maulbow
without
exciting
him
further
by
remaining
within
his
range
of
vision
after
a
moment
the
surgeon
shut
off
the
instruments
and
made
unobtrusive
use
of
a
heavy
tranquilizing
drug
then
it
waited
maulbow
should
have
lapsed
into
passive
somnolence
thirty
seconds
afterwards
but
the
drug
seemed
to
produce
no
more
effect
on
him
mentally
than
the
preceding
anesthetic
he
raged
and
screeched
on
gefty
watched
him
uneasily
knowing
now
that
he
was
looking
at
insanity
there
was
nothing
more
he
could
do
at
the
moment
the
autosurgeon
decisions
were
safer
than
any
nonprofessional
guesswork
and
the
surgeon
continued
to
wait
then
abruptly
maulbow
died
the
taut
body
slumped
against
the
bed
and
the
contorted
features
relaxed
the
eyes
remained
half
open
and
when
gefty
came
around
to
the
side
of
the
bed
they
still
seemed
to
be
looking
up
at
him
but
they
no
longer
moved
a
thin
trickle
of
blood
started
from
the
side
of
the
slack
mouth
and
stopped
again
the
control
compartment
was
still
darkened
and
without
power
when
gefty
returned
to
it
he
told
kerim
briefly
what
had
happened
added
i
not
at
all
sure
now
he
was
even
human
i
rather
believe
he
was
why
that
gefty
she
was
studying
his
expression
soberly
gefty
hesitated
said
i
thought
at
first
he
was
furious
because
upset
his
plans
but
they
were
his
plans
they
were
the
janandra
he
was
exactly
its
servant
i
suppose
you
have
to
say
he
was
something
like
a
pet
animal
kerim
said
incredulously
but
that
is
possible
think
of
how
intelligently
maulbow
he
was
following
instructions
gefty
said
the
janandra
let
him
know
whatever
it
wanted
done
he
was
following
instructions
again
when
he
tried
to
kill
me
after
i
got
away
from
the
thing
in
the
vault
the
real
brain
around
here
was
the
janandra
and
it
was
a
real
brain
with
a
little
luck
it
would
have
had
the
ship
kerim
smiled
briefly
you
handled
that
big
brain
rather
well
i
think
i
was
the
one
who
got
lucky
gefty
said
anyway
where
maulbow
came
from
it
the
janandra
kind
that
gives
the
orders
and
the
thing
is
maulbow
liked
it
that
way
he
did
want
it
to
be
different
when
the
light
hit
us
it
killed
the
janandra
on
the
outside
of
the
ship
maulbow
felt
it
happen
and
it
cracked
him
up
he
wanted
to
kill
us
for
it
but
since
he
was
helpless
he
killed
himself
he
did
want
to
be
healed
not
by
us
at
least
that
what
it
looks
like
he
shrugged
checked
his
watch
climbed
out
of
the
chair
well
he
said
the
ten
minutes
i
gave
the
to
turn
the
power
back
on
are
up
looks
like
the
old
girl
could
do
it
so
i
the
indirect
lighting
system
in
the
instrument
room
went
on
silently
the
emergency
light
flickered
and
went
out
gefty
head
came
around
kerim
was
staring
past
him
at
the
screens
her
face
radiant
oh
gefty
she
cried
softly
oh
gefty
our
stars
green
dot
here
is
us
gefty
explained
somewhat
hoarsely
he
cleared
his
throat
went
on
our
true
ship
position
that
is
he
stopped
realizing
he
was
talking
too
much
almost
babbling
in
an
attempt
to
take
some
of
the
tension
out
of
the
moment
the
next
few
seconds
might
not
tell
them
where
they
were
but
it
would
show
whether
they
had
been
carried
beyond
the
regions
of
space
charted
by
federation
instruments
which
would
mean
the
difference
between
having
a
chance
whether
a
good
chance
or
a
bad
one
of
getting
home
eventually
and
the
alternative
of
being
hopelessly
lost
there
had
been
nothing
recognizably
familiar
about
the
brilliantly
dense
star
patterns
in
the
viewscreens
but
he
gave
no
further
thought
to
that
unless
the
ship
exact
position
was
known
or
one
was
on
an
established
route
it
was
a
waste
of
time
looking
for
landmarks
in
a
sizable
cluster
he
turned
on
the
basic
star
chart
within
the
locator
plate
the
green
pinpoint
of
light
reappeared
and
suspended
now
against
the
immensities
of
the
milky
way
it
stayed
still
a
moment
began
a
smooth
drift
towards
galactic
east
gefty
let
his
breath
out
carefully
he
sensed
kerim
eyes
on
him
but
kept
his
gaze
fixed
on
the
locator
plate
the
green
dot
slowed
came
to
a
stop
gefty
finger
tapped
the
same
button
four
times
the
big
chart
flicked
out
of
existence
and
in
the
plate
three
regional
star
maps
appeared
and
vanished
in
quick
succession
behind
it
the
fourth
map
stayed
for
a
few
seconds
the
green
spark
was
not
visible
here
then
it
showed
at
the
eastern
margin
of
the
map
came
gliding
forwards
and
to
the
left
slowed
again
and
held
steady
now
the
star
map
began
to
glide
through
the
locator
plate
carrying
the
fixed
green
dot
with
it
it
brought
the
dot
up
to
dead
center
point
in
the
locator
plate
and
stopped
gefty
slumped
a
little
he
rubbed
his
hands
slowly
down
his
face
and
muttered
a
few
words
then
he
shook
his
head
gefty
kerim
whispered
what
is
it
where
are
we
gefty
looked
at
her
after
we
got
hauled
into
that
time
current
he
said
hoarsely
i
tried
to
find
out
which
way
in
space
we
were
headed
the
direction
indicators
over
there
seemed
to
show
we
were
trying
to
go
everywhere
at
once
you
remember
maulbow
control
unit
was
working
right
needed
adjustments
well
all
those
little
impulses
must
have
pretty
well
canceled
out
because
we
were
taken
really
far
in
the
last
hour
and
a
half
we
covered
roughly
the
distance
the
could
have
gone
on
her
own
in
say
thirty
days
then
where
home
gefty
said
simply
it
ridiculous
other
side
of
the
hub
from
where
we
started
he
nodded
at
the
plate
eastern
hub
quadrant
section
six
eight
the
behind
the
green
dot
that
the
evalee
system
we
could
be
putting
down
at
evalee
interstellar
three
hours
from
now
if
we
wanted
to
kerim
was
laughing
and
crying
together
oh
gefty
i
knew
you
would
a
fat
lot
i
had
to
do
with
it
gefty
leaned
forward
suddenly
switched
on
the
transmitter
and
now
let
pick
up
a
live
newscast
something
else
i
his
voice
trailed
off
the
transmitter
screen
lit
up
with
a
blurred
jumble
of
print
colors
a
muttering
of
voices
music
and
noises
gefty
twisted
a
dial
the
screen
cleared
showed
a
newscast
headline
sheet
gefty
blinked
at
it
glanced
sideways
at
kerim
grimaced
the
something
else
he
said
his
voice
a
little
strained
was
something
i
was
also
worried
about
looks
like
i
was
more
or
less
right
why
what
wrong
nothing
really
bad
gefty
assured
her
he
added
i
think
but
take
a
look
at
the
federation
dateline
kerim
peered
at
the
screen
frowned
but
why
that
that
almost
that
gefty
said
or
rather
is
the
day
after
we
started
out
from
the
hub
headed
roughly
galactic
west
three
weeks
ago
we
be
just
past
miam
he
knuckled
his
chin
interesting
thought
is
it
kerim
was
silent
for
long
seconds
then
they
or
we
oh
they
us
all
right
gefty
said
they
have
to
be
they
i
suppose
so
it
seems
a
little
confusing
but
i
was
thinking
if
you
send
them
a
transmitter
call
gefty
shook
his
head
the
transmitter
is
too
hot
but
it
might
push
a
call
as
far
as
evalee
then
we
could
arrange
for
a
there
and
in
another
ten
minutes
or
so
but
i
do
think
we
better
why
not
kerim
demanded
because
we
got
through
it
all
safely
so
we
going
to
get
through
it
safely
but
if
we
receive
that
message
now
and
never
go
on
to
moon
you
see
there
no
way
of
knowing
just
what
would
happen
kerim
looked
hesitant
frowned
i
suppose
you
right
she
agreed
reluctantly
at
last
so
maulbow
will
have
to
stay
dead
now
and
that
janandra
after
a
moment
she
added
pensively
of
course
they
were
really
very
nice
gefty
shivered
one
of
the
things
he
learned
from
maulbow
ravings
was
the
real
reason
he
and
kerim
had
been
taken
along
on
the
trip
he
did
feel
like
telling
kerim
about
it
just
yet
but
it
had
been
solely
because
of
maulbow
concern
for
his
master
creature
comforts
the
janandra
could
go
for
a
long
time
without
food
but
after
fasting
for
several
years
on
the
moon
a
couple
of
snacks
on
the
homeward
run
would
have
been
highly
welcome
and
the
janandra
was
a
gourmet
it
much
preferred
as
maulbow
well
knew
to
have
its
snacks
still
as
it
started
them
down
its
gullet
no
gefty
said
i
could
call
either
of
them
