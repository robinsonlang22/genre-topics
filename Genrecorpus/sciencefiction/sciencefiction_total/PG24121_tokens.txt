the
patient
sat
stiffly
in
the
leather
chair
on
the
other
side
of
the
desk
nervously
he
pressed
a
coin
into
the
palm
of
one
hand
just
start
anywhere
i
said
and
tell
me
all
about
it
as
before
without
waiting
for
an
answer
he
continued
the
coin
clutched
tightly
in
one
hand
i
charles
fisher
professor
of
philosophy
at
reiser
college
he
looked
at
me
quickly
or
at
least
i
was
until
recently
for
a
second
his
face
was
boyish
professor
of
philosophy
that
is
i
smiled
and
found
that
i
was
staring
at
the
coin
in
his
hand
he
gave
it
to
me
on
one
side
i
read
the
words
the
statement
on
the
other
side
of
this
coin
is
false
the
patient
watched
me
with
an
expressionless
face
i
turned
over
the
coin
it
was
engraved
with
the
words
the
statement
on
the
other
side
of
this
coin
is
false
that
not
the
problem
he
said
not
problem
i
had
the
coin
made
when
i
was
an
undergraduate
i
enjoyed
reading
one
side
turning
it
over
reading
the
other
side
and
so
on
a
fiendish
enjoyment
like
boys
planning
where
to
put
the
outhouse
i
looked
at
the
patient
he
was
single
medium
build
had
an
and
from
an
eastern
university
i
knew
this
and
more
from
the
folder
on
my
desk
eight
months
ago
he
continued
i
read
about
the
sphere
found
on
paney
island
he
stopped
looking
at
me
questioningly
yes
i
know
i
said
i
opened
my
desk
drawer
took
out
a
clipping
from
the
newspaper
and
handed
it
to
him
that
it
i
read
the
clipping
before
putting
it
back
in
the
drawer

archeologists
from
university
of
california
have
discovered
in
earth
fault
of
recent
quake
a
sphere
two
feet
in
diameter
of
an
unidentifiable
material
karl
schwartz
head
of
the
group
said
the
sphere
was
returned
to
the
university
for
study
he
declined
to
answer
questions
on
the
cultural
origin
of
the
sphere
there
was
any
more
in
the
newspapers
about
it
he
said
i
have
a
friend
in
california
who
got
me
the
photographs
looked
at
me
intently
you
wo
believe
any
of
this
he
pressed
the
coin
into
the
palm
of
his
hand
you
wo
be
able
to
the
photographs
he
continued
as
if
lecturing
were
of
characters
projected
by
the
sphere
when
placed
before
a
focused
light
the
sphere
was
transparent
you
see
imbedded
with
dark
microscopic
specks
by
moving
the
sphere
a
certain
distance
each
time
there
was
a
total
projection
of
three
hundred
and
sixty
different
characters
in
eighteen
different
orderings
or
nineteen
different
orderings
if
you
count
one
which
was
a
list
of
all
the
characters
i
made
a
mental
note
of
the
numbers
i
felt
they
were
significant
as
i
said
he
continued
i
obtained
the
photographs
of
the
characters
very
strange
shapes
totally
unlike
the
characters
of
oriental
languages
but
yet
that
is
the
closest
way
to
describe
them
he
jerked
forward
in
his
chair
except
of
course
ostensively
later
i
said
i
wanted
to
get
through
the
preliminaries
first
there
would
be
time
later
to
see
the
photographs
the
characters
projected
by
the
sphere
he
said
were
like
the
characters
of
any
known
language
he
paused
dramatically
there
was
reason
to
believe
they
had
origin
in
an
unknown
culture
a
culture
more
scientifically
advanced
than
our
own
and
the
reasons
for
this
supposition
i
asked
the
material
the
material
of
the
sphere
it
could
only
be
roughly
classified
as
totally
unknown
amazing
imperviousness
a
synthetic
material
hardly
the
product
of
a
former
culture
from
mars
i
said
smiling
there
were
all
kinds
of
conjectures
but
of
course
the
important
thing
was
to
see
if
the
projection
of
characters
was
a
message
the
message
if
any
would
mean
more
than
any
conjecture
you
translated
it
polished
the
coin
on
his
jacket
you
wo
dare
believe
it
he
said
he
cleared
his
throat
and
stiffened
into
a
more
rigid
posture
it
was
exactly
translation
you
see
none
of
the
characters
had
designation
they
were
just
characters
so
it
was
a
problem
of
decoding
i
asked
as
it
turned
out
no
decoding
is
dependent
on
knowledge
of
language
characteristics
characteristics
of
known
languages
decoding
was
tried
but
without
success
no
what
we
had
to
find
was
a
key
to
the
language
you
mean
like
the
rune
stone
more
or
less
in
principle
we
needed
a
picture
of
a
cow
and
a
sign
of
meaning
indicating
one
of
the
characters
for
me
there
was
no
possibility
of
finding
similarities
between
the
characters
and
characters
of
other
languages
that
would
require
tremendous
linguistic
knowledge
and
library
facilities
nor
could
i
use
a
decoding
approach
that
would
require
special
knowledge
of
techniques
and
access
to
electronic
computers
and
other
mechanical
aids
no
i
had
to
work
on
the
assumption
that
the
key
to
the
sphere
was
implicit
in
the
sphere
you
hoped
to
find
the
key
to
the
language
in
the
language
itself
exactly
you
know
of
course
some
languages
do
have
an
implicit
key
for
example
hieroglyphics
or
picture
language
the
word
for
is
a
picture
of
a
cow
looked
at
the
toes
of
his
shoes
you
wo
be
able
to
believe
it
it
impossible
to
believe
i
use
the
word
impossible
in
its
logical
in
most
languages
he
continued
looking
up
from
his
shoes
the
sound
of
some
words
themselves
indicates
the
meaning
of
the
word
onomatopoetic
words
like
and
the
key
to
the
unknown
language
i
asked
how
did
you
find
it
i
watched
him
push
the
coin
against
the
back
of
his
arm
then
lift
it
to
read
the
backward
letters
pressed
into
his
skin
he
looked
up
at
me
and
smiled
i
built
models
of
the
characters
big
material
ones
exactly
proportionate
to
the
ones
projected
then
quite
by
accident
i
viewed
one
of
them
through
a
glass
globe
the
size
of
the
original
sphere
what
do
you
think
i
saw
what
i
noticed
he
had
the
boyish
look
again
a
distortion
of
the
model
but
that
not
what
important
the
distortions
on
study
gave
specific
visual
entities
like
when
looking
at
one
of
those
trick
pictures
and
suddenly
seeing
the
lion
in
the
grass
the
lines
outlining
the
lion
are
there
all
the
time
only
the
observer
has
to
view
them
as
the
outline
of
a
lion
it
was
the
same
with
the
models
of
the
characters
except
the
shapes
that
appeared
were
not
of
lions
or
other
recognizable
things
but
they
did
suggest
pressed
the
coin
against
his
forehead
closed
his
eyes
and
appeared
to
be
thinking
deeply
yes
impossible
to
believe
no
one
can
believe
it
in
addition
to
the
visual
response
the
distortions
gave
me
definite
feelings
not
mixtures
of
feelings
but
one
definite
emotional
experience
how
do
you
mean
one
character
when
viewed
through
the
globe
gave
me
a
visual
image
and
at
the
same
time
a
strong
feeling
of
light
hilarity
i
take
it
then
that
these
distortions
seemed
to
connote
meanings
rather
than
denote
them
you
might
say
that
their
meaning
was
conveyed
through
a
gestalt
experience
on
the
part
of
the
observer
yes
each
character
gave
a
definite
gestalt
but
the
gestalt
was
the
same
for
each
observer
or
at
least
for
observers
there
was
an
eighty
per
cent
correlation
i
whistled
softly
and
the
translation
doctor
what
would
you
say
if
i
told
you
the
translation
was
unbelievable
that
it
could
be
seriously
entertained
by
any
man
what
if
i
said
that
it
would
take
the
sanity
of
any
man
who
believed
it
i
would
say
that
it
might
well
be
incorrect
he
took
some
papers
from
his
pocket
and
laughed
excitedly
slumping
down
in
the
chair
this
is
the
complete
translation
in
idiomatic
english
i
going
to
let
you
read
it
but
first
i
want
you
to
consider
a
few
things
he
hid
the
papers
behind
the
back
of
his
chair
his
face
became
even
more
boyish
almost
as
if
he
were
deciding
on
where
to
put
the
tipped
over
outhouse
consider
first
doctor
that
there
was
a
total
projection
of
three
hundred
and
sixty
different
characters
the
same
number
as
the
number
of
degrees
in
a
circle
consider
also
that
there
were
eighteen
different
orderings
of
the
characters
or
nineteen
counting
the
alphabetical
list
the
square
root
of
three
hundred
and
sixty
would
lie
between
eighteen
and
nineteen
yes
i
said
i
remembered
there
was
something
significant
about
the
numbers
but
i
was
at
all
sure
that
it
was
this
consider
also
he
continued
that
the
communication
was
through
the
medium
of
a
sphere
moreover
keep
in
mind
that
physics
accepts
the
path
of
a
beam
of
light
as
its
definition
of
a
straight
line
yet
the
path
is
a
curve
if
extended
sufficiently
it
would
be
a
circle
the
section
of
a
sphere
all
right
i
said
by
now
the
patient
was
pounding
the
coin
against
the
sole
of
one
shoe
and
he
said
keep
in
mind
that
in
some
sense
time
can
be
thought
of
as
another
dimension
he
suddenly
thrust
the
papers
at
me
and
sat
back
in
the
chair
i
picked
up
the
translation
and
began
reading
the
patient
sat
stiffly
in
the
leather
chair
on
the
other
side
of
the
desk
nervously
he
pressed
a
coin
into
the
palm
of
one
hand
just
start
anywhere
i
said
and
tell
me
all
about
it
as
before
without
waiting
for

he
continued
the

clutched
tightly
in

hand

the
end
