this
story
was
first
published
in
march
and
the
etext
was
produced
from
the
anthology
all
the
traps
of
earth
and
other
stories
extensive
research
did
not
uncover
any
evidence
that
the
copyright
on
this
publication
was
renewed
project
mastodon
by
clifford
simak
the
chief
of
protocol
said
hudson
of
ah
mastodonia
the
secretary
of
state
held
out
his
hand
i
glad
to
see
you
hudson
i
understand
you
been
here
several
times
that
right
said
hudson
i
had
a
hard
time
making
your
people
believe
i
was
in
earnest
and
are
you
mr
hudson
believe
me
sir
i
would
not
try
to
fool
you
and
this
mastodonia
said
the
secretary
reaching
down
to
tap
the
document
upon
the
desk
you
will
pardon
me
but
i
never
heard
of
it
it
a
new
nation
hudson
explained
but
quite
legitimate
we
have
a
constitution
a
democratic
form
of
government
duly
elected
officials
and
a
code
of
laws
we
are
a
free
people
and
we
are
possessed
of
a
vast
amount
of
natural
resources
and
please
tell
me
sir
interrupted
the
secretary
just
where
are
you
located
technically
you
are
our
nearest
neighbors
but
that
is
ridiculous
exploded
protocol
not
at
all
insisted
hudson
if
you
will
give
me
a
moment
secretary
i
have
considerable
evidence
he
brushed
the
fingers
of
protocol
off
his
sleeve
and
stepped
forward
to
the
desk
laying
down
the
portfolio
he
carried
go
ahead
hudson
said
the
secretary
why
do
we
all
sit
down
and
be
comfortable
while
we
talk
this
over
you
have
my
credentials
i
see
now
here
is
a
propos
i
have
a
document
signed
by
a
certain
wesley
adams
he
our
first
president
said
hudson
our
george
washington
you
might
say
what
is
the
purpose
of
this
visit
mr
hudson
we
like
to
establish
diplomatic
relations
we
think
it
would
be
to
our
mutual
benefit
after
all
we
are
a
sister
republic
in
perfect
sympathy
with
your
policies
and
aims
we
like
to
negotiate
trade
agreements
and
we
be
grateful
for
some
point
four
aid
the
secretary
smiled
naturally
who
does
we
prepared
to
offer
something
in
return
hudson
told
him
stiffly
for
one
thing
we
could
offer
sanctuary
sanctuary
i
understand
said
hudson
that
in
the
present
state
of
international
tensions
a
foolproof
sanctuary
is
not
something
to
be
sneezed
at
the
secretary
turned
stone
cold
i
an
extremely
busy
man
protocol
took
hudson
firmly
by
the
arm
out
you
go
general
leslie
bowers
put
in
a
call
to
state
and
got
the
secretary
i
do
like
to
bother
you
herb
he
said
but
something
i
want
to
check
maybe
you
can
help
me
glad
to
help
you
if
i
can
there
a
fellow
hanging
around
out
here
at
the
pentagon
trying
to
get
in
to
see
me
said
i
was
the
only
one
he
talk
to
but
you
know
how
it
is
i
certainly
do
name
of
huston
or
hudson
or
something
like
that
he
was
here
just
an
hour
or
so
ago
said
the
secretary
crackpot
sort
of
fellow
he
gone
now
yes
i
do
think
he
be
back
did
he
say
where
you
could
reach
him
no
i
do
believe
he
did
how
did
he
strike
you
i
mean
what
kind
of
impression
did
you
get
of
him
i
told
you
a
crackpot
i
suppose
he
is
he
said
something
to
one
of
the
colonels
that
got
me
worrying
ca
pass
up
anything
you
know
not
in
the
dirty
tricks
department
even
if
it
crackpot
these
days
you
got
to
have
a
look
at
it
he
offered
sanctuary
said
the
secretary
indignantly
can
you
imagine
that
he
been
making
the
rounds
i
guess
the
general
said
he
was
over
at
aec
told
them
some
sort
of
tale
about
knowing
where
there
were
vast
uranium
deposits
it
was
the
aec
that
told
me
he
was
heading
your
way
we
get
them
all
the
time
usually
we
can
ease
them
out
this
hudson
was
just
a
little
better
than
the
most
of
them
he
got
in
to
see
me
he
told
the
colonel
something
about
having
a
plan
that
would
enable
us
to
establish
secret
bases
anywhere
we
wished
even
in
the
territory
of
potential
enemies
i
know
it
sounds
crazy
forget
it
les
you
probably
right
said
the
general
but
this
idea
sends
me
can
you
imagine
the
look
on
their
iron
curtain
faces
the
scared
little
government
clerk
darting
conspiratorial
glances
all
about
him
brought
the
portfolio
to
the
fbi
i
found
it
in
a
bar
down
the
street
he
told
the
man
who
took
him
in
tow
been
going
there
for
years
and
i
found
this
portfolio
laying
in
the
booth
i
saw
the
man
who
must
have
left
it
there
and
i
tried
to
find
him
later
but
i
could
how
do
you
know
he
left
it
there
i
just
figured
he
did
he
left
the
booth
just
as
i
came
in
and
it
was
sort
of
dark
in
there
and
it
took
a
minute
to
see
this
thing
laying
there
you
see
i
always
take
the
same
booth
every
day
and
joe
sees
me
come
in
and
he
brings
me
the
usual
and
you
saw
this
man
leave
the
booth
you
usually
sit
in
that
right
then
you
saw
the
portfolio
yes
sir
you
tried
to
find
the
man
thinking
it
must
have
been
his
that
exactly
what
i
did
but
by
the
time
you
went
to
look
for
him
he
had
disappeared
that
the
way
it
was
now
tell
me
why
did
you
bring
it
here
why
did
you
turn
it
in
to
the
management
so
the
man
could
come
back
and
claim
it
well
sir
it
was
like
this
i
had
a
drink
or
two
and
i
was
wondering
all
the
time
what
was
in
that
portfolio
so
finally
i
took
a
peek
and
and
what
you
saw
decided
you
to
bring
it
here
to
us
that
right
i
saw
do
tell
me
what
you
saw
give
me
your
name
and
address
and
do
say
anything
about
this
you
understand
that
we
grateful
to
you
for
thinking
of
us
but
we
rather
you
said
nothing
mum
the
word
the
little
clerk
assured
him
full
of
vast
importance
the
fbi
phoned
ambrose
amberly
smithsonian
expert
on
paleontology
we
got
something
doctor
that
we
like
you
to
have
a
look
at
a
lot
of
movie
film
i
be
most
happy
to
i
come
down
as
soon
as
i
get
clear
end
of
the
week
perhaps
this
is
very
urgent
doctor
damnest
thing
you
ever
saw
big
shaggy
elephants
and
tigers
with
teeth
down
to
their
necks
there
a
beaver
the
size
of
a
bear
fakes
said
amberly
disgusted
clever
gadgets
camera
angles
that
what
we
thought
first
but
there
are
no
gadgets
no
camera
angles
this
is
the
real
mccoy
i
on
my
way
the
paleontologist
said
hanging
up
item
in
smug
smartaleck
gossip
column
saucers
are
pass√©
at
the
pentagon
there
another
mystery
that
got
the
high
brass
very
ii
president
wesley
adams
and
secretary
of
state
john
cooper
sat
glumly
under
a
tree
in
the
capital
of
mastodonia
and
waited
for
the
ambassador
extraordinary
to
return
i
tell
you
wes
said
cooper
who
under
various
pseudonyms
was
also
the
secretaries
of
commerce
treasury
and
war
this
is
a
crazy
thing
we
did
what
if
chuck
ca
get
back
they
might
throw
him
in
jail
or
something
might
happen
to
the
time
unit
or
the
helicopter
we
should
have
gone
along
we
had
to
stay
adams
said
you
know
what
would
happen
to
this
camp
and
our
supplies
if
we
were
around
here
to
guard
them
the
only
thing
that
given
us
any
trouble
is
that
old
mastodon
if
he
comes
around
again
i
going
to
take
a
skillet
and
bang
him
in
the
brisket
that
is
the
only
reason
either
said
president
adams
and
you
know
it
we
ca
go
deserting
this
nation
now
that
created
it
we
have
to
keep
possession
just
planting
a
flag
and
saying
it
ours
would
be
enough
we
might
be
called
upon
for
proof
that
we
established
residence
something
like
the
old
homestead
laws
you
know
we
establish
residence
sure
enough
growled
secretary
cooper
if
something
happens
to
that
time
unit
or
the
helicopter
you
think
they
do
it
johnny
who
do
what
the
united
states
do
you
think
they
recognize
us
not
if
they
know
who
we
are
that
what
i
afraid
of
chuck
will
talk
them
into
it
he
can
talk
the
skin
right
off
a
cat
sometimes
i
think
we
going
at
this
wrong
sure
chuck
got
the
view
and
i
suppose
it
best
but
maybe
what
we
ought
to
do
is
grab
a
good
fast
profit
and
get
out
of
here
we
could
take
in
hunting
parties
at
ten
thousand
a
head
or
maybe
we
could
lease
it
to
a
movie
company
we
can
do
all
that
and
do
it
legally
and
with
full
protection
cooper
told
him
if
we
can
get
ourselves
recognized
as
a
sovereign
nation
if
we
negotiate
a
mutual
defense
pact
no
one
would
dare
get
hostile
because
we
could
squawk
to
uncle
sam
all
you
say
is
true
adams
agreed
but
there
are
going
to
be
questions
it
is
just
a
matter
of
walking
into
washington
and
getting
recognition
they
want
to
know
about
us
such
as
our
population
what
if
chuck
has
to
tell
them
it
a
total
of
three
persons
cooper
shook
his
head
he
would
answer
that
way
wes
duck
the
question
or
give
them
some
diplomatic
after
all
how
can
we
be
there
are
only
three
of
us
we
took
over
the
whole
continent
remember
you
know
well
enough
johnny
there
are
no
other
humans
back
here
in
north
america
the
farthest
back
any
scientist
will
place
the
migrations
from
asia
is
years
they
have
got
here
yet
maybe
we
should
have
done
it
differently
mused
cooper
maybe
we
should
have
included
the
whole
world
in
our
proclamation
not
just
the
continent
that
way
we
could
claim
quite
a
population
it
would
have
held
water
even
as
it
is
we
went
a
little
further
than
precedent
allows
the
old
explorers
usually
laid
claim
to
certain
watersheds
they
find
a
river
and
lay
claim
to
all
the
territory
drained
by
the
river
they
did
go
grabbing
off
whole
continents
that
because
they
were
never
sure
of
exactly
what
they
had
said
cooper
we
are
we
have
what
you
might
call
the
advantage
of
hindsight
he
leaned
back
against
the
tree
and
stared
across
the
land
it
was
a
pretty
place
he
thought
the
rolling
ridges
covered
by
vast
grazing
areas
and
small
groves
the
river
valley
and
everywhere
one
looked
the
grazing
herds
of
mastodon
giant
bison
and
wild
horses
with
the
less
gregarious
fauna
scattered
hit
and
miss
old
buster
the
troublesome
mastodon
a
lone
bull
which
had
been
probably
run
out
of
a
herd
by
a
younger
rival
stood
at
the
edge
of
a
grove
a
away
he
had
his
head
down
and
was
curling
and
uncurling
his
trunk
in
an
aimless
sort
of
way
while
he
teetered
slowly
in
a
fashion
by
lifting
first
one
foot
and
then
another
the
old
cuss
was
lonely
cooper
told
himself
that
was
why
he
hung
around
like
a
homeless
dog
except
that
he
was
too
big
and
awkward
to
have
much
and
more
than
likely
his
temper
was
unstable
the
afternoon
sun
was
pleasantly
warm
and
the
air
it
seemed
to
cooper
was
the
freshest
he
had
ever
smelled
it
was
altogether
a
very
pleasant
place
an
sort
of
land
ideal
for
a
sunday
picnic
or
a
camping
trip
the
breeze
was
just
enough
to
float
out
from
its
flagstaff
before
the
tent
the
national
banner
of
mastodonia
a
red
rampant
mastodon
upon
a
field
of
green
you
know
johnny
said
adams
there
one
thing
that
worries
me
a
lot
if
we
going
to
base
our
claim
on
precedent
we
may
be
way
off
base
the
old
explorers
always
claimed
their
discoveries
for
their
nations
or
their
king
never
for
themselves
the
principle
was
entirely
different
cooper
told
him
nobody
ever
did
anything
for
himself
in
those
days
everyone
was
always
under
someone
else
protection
the
explorers
either
were
financed
by
their
governments
or
were
sponsored
by
them
or
operated
under
a
royal
charter
or
a
patent
with
us
different
ours
is
a
private
enterprise
you
dreamed
up
the
time
unit
and
built
it
the
three
of
us
chipped
in
to
buy
the
helicopter
we
paid
all
of
our
expenses
out
of
our
own
pockets
we
never
got
a
dime
from
anyone
what
we
found
is
ours
i
hope
you
right
said
adams
uneasily
old
buster
had
moved
out
from
the
grove
and
was
shuffling
warily
toward
the
camp
adams
picked
up
the
rifle
that
lay
across
his
knees
wait
said
cooper
sharply
maybe
he
just
bluffing
it
would
be
a
shame
to
plaster
him
he
such
a
nice
old
guy
adams
half
raised
the
rifle
i
give
him
three
steps
more
he
announced
i
had
enough
of
him
suddenly
a
roar
burst
out
of
the
air
just
above
their
heads
the
two
leaped
to
their
feet
it
chuck
cooper
yelled
he
back
the
helicopter
made
a
of
the
camp
and
came
rapidly
to
earth
trumpeting
with
terror
old
buster
was
a
dwindling
dot
far
down
the
grassy
ridge
iii
they
built
the
nightly
fires
circling
the
camp
to
keep
out
the
animals
it
be
the
death
of
me
yet
said
adams
wearily
cutting
all
this
wood
we
have
to
get
to
work
on
that
stockade
cooper
said
fooled
around
too
long
some
night
fire
or
no
fire
a
herd
of
mastodon
will
come
busting
in
here
and
if
they
ever
hit
the
helicopter
we
be
dead
ducks
it
would
take
more
than
just
five
seconds
to
turn
us
into
robinson
crusoes
of
the
pleistocene
well
now
that
this
recognition
thing
has
petered
out
on
us
said
adams
maybe
we
can
get
down
to
business
trouble
is
cooper
answered
we
spent
about
the
last
of
our
money
on
the
chain
saw
to
cut
this
wood
and
on
chuck
trip
to
washington
to
build
a
stockade
we
need
a
tractor
we
kill
ourselves
if
we
tried
to
rassle
that
many
logs
maybe
we
could
catch
some
of
those
horses
running
around
out
there
have
you
ever
broken
a
horse
no
that
one
thing
i
never
tried
me
either
how
about
you
chuck
not
me
said
the
extraordinary
bluntly
cooper
squatted
down
beside
the
coals
of
the
cooking
fire
and
twirled
the
spit
upon
the
spit
were
three
grouse
and
half
a
dozen
quail
the
huge
coffee
pot
was
sending
out
a
aroma
biscuits
were
baking
in
the
reflector
we
been
here
six
weeks
he
said
and
we
still
living
in
a
tent
and
cooking
on
an
open
fire
we
better
get
busy
and
get
something
done
the
stockade
first
said
adams
and
that
means
a
tractor
we
could
use
the
helicopter
do
you
want
to
take
the
chance
that
our
getaway
once
something
happens
to
it
i
guess
not
cooper
admitted
gulping
we
could
use
some
of
that
point
four
aid
right
now
commented
adams
they
threw
me
out
said
hudson
everywhere
i
went
sooner
or
later
they
got
around
to
throwing
me
out
they
were
real
organized
about
it
well
we
tried
adams
said
and
to
top
it
off
added
hudson
i
had
to
go
and
lose
all
that
film
and
now
we
have
to
waste
our
time
taking
more
of
it
personally
i
do
ever
want
to
let
another
get
that
close
to
me
while
i
hold
the
camera
you
did
have
a
thing
to
worry
about
adams
objected
johnny
was
right
there
behind
you
with
the
gun
yeah
with
the
muzzle
about
a
foot
from
my
head
when
he
let
go
i
stopped
him
did
i
demanded
cooper
with
his
head
right
in
my
lap
maybe
we
wo
have
to
take
any
more
pictures
adams
suggested
we
have
to
cooper
said
there
are
sportsmen
up
ahead
fork
over
ten
thousand
bucks
easy
for
two
weeks
of
hunting
here
but
before
we
could
sell
them
on
it
we
have
to
show
them
movies
that
scene
with
the
would
cinch
it
if
it
did
scare
them
off
hudson
pointed
out
the
last
few
feet
showed
nothing
but
the
inside
of
his
throat
hudson
looked
unhappy
i
do
like
the
whole
setup
as
soon
as
we
bring
someone
in
the
news
is
sure
to
leak
and
once
the
word
gets
out
there
be
guys
lying
in
ambush
for
us
maybe
even
nations
scheming
to
steal
the
legally
or
violently
that
what
scares
me
the
most
about
those
films
i
lost
someone
will
find
them
and
they
may
guess
what
it
all
about
but
i
hoping
they
either
wo
believe
it
or
ca
manage
to
trace
us
we
could
swear
the
hunting
parties
to
secrecy
said
cooper
how
could
a
sportsman
keep
still
about
the
mounted
head
of
a
or
a
record
piece
of
ivory
and
the
same
thing
would
apply
to
anyone
we
approached
some
university
could
raise
dough
to
send
a
team
of
scientists
back
here
and
a
movie
company
would
cough
up
plenty
to
use
this
place
as
a
location
for
a
caveman
epic
but
it
would
be
worth
a
thing
to
either
of
them
if
they
could
tell
about
it
now
if
we
could
have
gotten
recognition
as
a
nation
we
have
been
all
set
we
could
make
our
own
laws
and
regulations
and
be
able
to
enforce
them
we
could
bring
in
settlers
and
establish
trade
we
could
exploit
our
natural
resources
it
would
all
be
legal
and
aboveboard
we
could
tell
who
we
were
and
where
we
were
and
what
we
had
to
offer
we
are
licked
yet
said
adams
there
a
lot
that
we
can
do
those
river
hills
are
covered
with
ginseng
we
can
each
dig
a
dozen
pounds
a
day
there
good
money
in
the
root
ginseng
root
cooper
said
is
peanuts
we
need
money
or
we
could
trap
offered
adams
the
place
is
alive
with
beaver
have
you
taken
a
good
look
at
those
beaver
they
about
the
size
of
a
st
bernard
all
the
better
think
how
much
just
one
pelt
would
bring
no
dealer
would
believe
that
it
was
beaver
he
think
you
were
trying
to
pull
a
fast
one
on
him
and
there
are
only
a
few
states
that
allow
beaver
to
be
trapped
to
sell
the
pelts
even
if
you
could
you
have
to
take
out
licenses
in
each
of
those
states
those
mastodon
carry
a
lot
of
ivory
said
cooper
and
if
we
wanted
to
go
north
we
find
mammoths
that
would
carry
even
more
and
get
socked
into
the
jug
for
ivory
smuggling
they
sat
all
three
of
them
staring
at
the
fire
not
finding
anything
to
say
the
moaning
complaint
of
a
giant
hunting
cat
came
from
somewhere
up
the
river
iv
hudson
lay
in
his
sleeping
bag
staring
at
the
sky
it
bothered
him
a
lot
there
was
not
one
familiar
constellation
not
one
star
that
he
could
name
with
any
certainty
this
juggling
of
the
stars
he
thought
emphasized
more
than
anything
else
in
this
ancient
land
the
vast
gulf
of
years
which
lay
between
him
and
the
earth
where
he
had
been
or
would
be
born
a
hundred
and
fifty
thousand
years
adams
had
said
give
or
take
ten
thousand
there
just
was
no
way
to
know
later
on
there
might
be
a
measurement
of
the
stars
and
a
comparison
with
their
positions
in
the
twentieth
century
might
be
one
way
of
doing
it
but
at
the
moment
any
figure
could
be
no
more
than
a
guess
the
time
machine
was
not
something
that
could
be
tested
for
calibration
or
performance
as
a
matter
of
fact
there
no
way
to
test
it
they
had
not
been
certain
he
remembered
the
first
time
they
had
used
it
that
it
would
really
work
there
had
been
no
way
to
find
out
when
it
worked
you
knew
it
worked
and
if
it
had
worked
there
would
have
been
no
way
of
knowing
beforehand
that
it
would
adams
had
been
sure
of
course
but
that
had
been
because
he
had
absolute
reliance
in
the
concepts
he
had
worked
out
concepts
that
neither
hudson
nor
cooper
could
come
close
to
understanding
that
had
always
been
the
way
it
had
been
even
when
they
were
kids
with
wes
dreaming
up
the
deals
that
he
and
johnny
carried
out
back
in
those
days
too
they
had
used
time
travel
in
their
play
out
in
johnny
back
yard
they
had
rigged
up
a
time
machine
out
of
a
wonderful
collection
of
salvaged
junk
a
wooden
crate
an
empty
paint
pail
a
battered
coffee
maker
a
bunch
of
discarded
copper
tubing
a
busted
steering
wheel
and
other
odds
and
ends
in
it
they
had
traveled
back
to
land
and
and
and
the
slaughter
he
remembered
had
been
wonderfully
appalling
but
in
reality
it
had
been
much
different
there
was
much
more
to
it
than
gunning
down
the
weird
fauna
that
one
found
and
they
should
have
known
there
would
be
for
they
had
talked
about
it
often
he
thought
of
the
bull
session
back
in
university
and
the
little
usually
silent
kid
who
sat
quietly
in
the
corner
a
student
whose
last
name
had
been
pritchard
and
after
sitting
silently
for
some
time
this
pritchard
kid
had
spoken
up
if
you
guys
ever
do
travel
in
time
you
run
up
against
more
than
you
bargain
for
i
do
mean
the
climate
or
the
terrain
or
the
fauna
but
the
economics
and
the
politics
they
all
jeered
at
him
hudson
remembered
and
then
had
gone
on
with
their
talk
and
after
a
short
while
the
talk
had
turned
to
women
as
it
always
did
he
wondered
where
that
quiet
man
might
be
some
day
hudson
told
himself
i
have
to
look
him
up
and
tell
him
he
was
right
we
did
it
wrong
he
thought
there
were
so
many
other
ways
we
might
have
done
it
but
we
been
so
sure
and
greedy
greedy
for
the
triumph
and
the
glory
and
now
there
was
no
easy
way
to
collect
on
the
verge
of
success
they
could
have
sought
out
help
gone
to
some
large
industrial
concern
or
an
educational
foundation
or
even
to
the
government
like
historic
explorers
they
could
have
obtained
subsidization
and
sponsorship
then
they
would
have
had
protection
funds
to
do
a
proper
job
and
they
need
not
have
operated
on
their
present
shoestring
one
helicopter
and
one
time
unit
they
could
have
had
several
and
at
least
one
standing
by
in
the
twentieth
century
as
a
rescue
unit
should
that
be
necessary
but
that
would
have
meant
a
bargain
perhaps
a
very
hard
one
and
sharing
with
someone
who
had
contributed
nothing
but
the
money
and
there
was
more
than
money
in
a
thing
like
this
there
were
twenty
years
of
dreams
and
a
great
idea
and
the
dedication
to
that
great
idea
years
of
work
and
years
of
disappointment
and
an
almost
fanatical
refusal
to
give
up
even
so
thought
hudson
they
had
figured
well
enough
there
had
been
many
chances
to
make
blunders
and
they
made
relatively
few
all
they
lacked
in
the
last
analysis
was
backing
take
the
helicopter
for
example
it
was
the
one
satisfactory
vehicle
for
time
traveling
you
had
to
get
up
in
the
air
to
clear
whatever
upheavals
and
subsidences
there
had
been
through
geologic
ages
the
helicopter
took
you
up
and
kept
you
clear
and
gave
you
a
chance
to
pick
a
proper
landing
place
travel
without
it
and
granting
you
were
lucky
with
land
surfaces
you
still
might
materialize
in
the
heart
of
some
great
tree
or
end
up
in
a
swamp
or
the
middle
of
a
herd
of
startled
savage
beasts
a
plane
would
have
done
as
well
but
back
in
this
world
you
could
land
a
plane
or
you
could
be
certain
that
you
could
a
helicopter
though
could
land
almost
anywhere
in
the
they
had
traveled
they
almost
certainly
had
been
lucky
although
one
could
not
be
entirely
sure
just
how
great
a
part
of
it
was
luck
wes
had
felt
that
he
had
not
been
working
as
blindly
as
it
sometimes
might
appear
he
had
calibrated
the
unit
for
jumps
of
years
finer
calibration
he
had
said
realistically
would
have
to
wait
for
more
developmental
work
using
the
calibrations
they
had
figured
it
out
one
jump
conceding
that
the
calibration
was
correct
would
have
landed
them
at
the
end
of
the
wisconsin
glacial
period
two
jumps
at
its
beginning
the
third
would
set
them
down
toward
the
end
of
the
sangamon
interglacial
and
apparently
it
had
give
or
take
ten
thousand
years
or
so
they
had
arrived
at
a
time
when
the
climate
did
not
seem
to
vary
greatly
either
hot
or
cold
the
flora
was
modern
enough
to
give
them
a
homelike
feeling
the
fauna
modern
and
pleistocenic
overlapped
and
the
surface
features
were
little
altered
from
the
twentieth
century
the
rivers
ran
along
familiar
paths
the
hills
and
bluffs
looked
much
the
same
in
this
corner
of
the
earth
at
least
years
had
not
changed
things
greatly
boyhood
dreams
hudson
thought
were
wondrous
it
was
not
often
that
three
men
who
had
daydreamed
in
their
youth
could
follow
it
out
to
its
end
but
they
had
and
here
they
were
johnny
was
on
watch
and
it
was
hudson
turn
next
and
better
get
to
sleep
he
closed
his
eyes
then
opened
them
again
for
another
look
at
the
unfamiliar
stars
the
east
he
saw
was
flushed
with
silver
light
soon
the
moon
would
rise
which
was
good
a
man
could
keep
a
better
watch
when
the
moon
was
up
he
woke
suddenly
snatched
upright
and
into
full
awareness
by
the
clamor
that
slashed
across
the
night
the
very
air
seemed
curdled
by
the
savage
racket
and
for
a
moment
he
sat
numbed
by
it
then
slowly
it
seemed
his
brain
took
the
noise
and
separated
it
into
two
distinct
but
intermingled
categories
the
deadly
screaming
of
a
cat
and
the
maddened
trumpeting
of
a
mastodon
the
moon
was
up
and
the
countryside
was
flooded
by
its
light
cooper
he
saw
was
out
beyond
the
watchfires
standing
there
and
watching
with
his
rifle
ready
adams
was
scrambling
out
of
his
sleeping
bag
swearing
softly
to
himself
the
cooking
fire
had
burned
down
to
a
bed
of
mottled
coals
but
the
watchfires
still
were
burning
and
the
helicopter
parked
within
their
circle
picked
up
the
glint
of
flames
it
buster
adams
told
him
angrily
i
know
that
bellowing
of
his
anywhere
he
done
nothing
but
parade
up
and
down
and
bellow
ever
since
we
got
here
and
now
he
seems
to
have
gone
out
and
found
himself
a
hudson
zipped
down
his
sleeping
bag
grabbed
up
his
rifle
and
jumped
to
his
feet
following
adams
in
a
silent
rush
to
where
cooper
stood
cooper
motioned
at
them
do
break
it
up
you
never
see
the
like
of
it
again
adams
brought
his
rifle
up
cooper
knocked
the
barrel
down
you
fool
he
shouted
you
want
them
turning
on
us
two
hundred
yards
away
stood
the
mastodon
and
on
his
back
the
screeching
the
great
beast
reared
into
the
air
and
came
down
with
a
jolt
bucking
to
unseat
the
cat
flailing
the
air
with
his
massive
trunk
and
as
he
bucked
the
cat
struck
and
struck
again
with
his
gleaming
teeth
aiming
for
the
spine
then
the
mastodon
crashed
head
downward
as
if
to
turn
a
somersault
rolled
and
was
on
his
feet
again
closer
to
them
now
than
he
had
been
before
the
huge
cat
had
sprung
off
for
a
moment
the
two
stood
facing
one
another
then
the
tiger
charged
a
flowing
streak
of
motion
in
the
moonlight
buster
wheeled
away
and
the
cat
leaping
hit
his
shoulder
clawed
wildly
and
slid
off
the
mastodon
whipped
to
the
attack
tusks
slashing
huge
feet
stamping
the
cat
caught
a
glancing
blow
by
one
of
the
tusks
screamed
and
leaped
up
to
land
in
fashion
upon
buster
head
maddened
with
pain
and
fright
blinded
by
the
tiger
raking
claws
the
old
mastodon
ran
straight
toward
the
camp
and
as
he
ran
he
grasped
the
cat
in
his
trunk
and
tore
him
from
his
hold
lifted
him
high
and
threw
him
look
out
yelled
cooper
and
brought
his
rifle
up
and
fired
for
an
instant
hudson
saw
it
all
as
if
it
were
a
single
scene
motionless
one
frame
snatched
from
a
fantastic
movie
epic
the
charging
mastodon
with
the
tiger
lifted
and
the
sound
track
one
great
blast
of
bloodthirsty
bedlam
then
the
scene
dissolved
in
a
blur
of
motion
he
felt
his
rifle
thud
against
his
shoulder
knowing
he
had
fired
but
not
hearing
the
explosion
and
the
mastodon
was
almost
on
top
of
him
bearing
down
like
some
mighty
and
remorseless
engine
of
blind
destruction
he
flung
himself
to
one
side
and
the
giant
brushed
past
him
out
of
the
tail
of
his
eye
he
saw
the
thrown
crash
to
earth
within
the
circle
of
the
watchfires
he
brought
his
rifle
up
again
and
caught
the
area
behind
ear
within
his
sights
he
pressed
the
trigger
the
mastodon
staggered
then
regained
his
stride
and
went
rushing
on
he
hit
one
of
the
watchfires
dead
center
and
went
through
it
scattering
coals
and
burning
brands
then
there
was
a
thud
and
the
screeching
clang
of
metal
oh
no
shouted
hudson
rushing
forward
they
stopped
inside
the
circle
of
the
fires
the
helicopter
lay
tilted
at
a
crazy
angle
one
of
its
rotor
blades
was
crumpled
half
across
it
as
if
he
might
have
fallen
as
he
tried
to
bull
his
mad
way
over
it
lay
the
mastodon
something
crawled
across
the
ground
toward
them
its
spitting
snarling
mouth
gaping
in
the
firelight
its
back
broken
hind
legs
trailing
calmly
without
a
word
adams
put
a
bullet
into
the
head
of
the
v
general
leslie
bowers
rose
from
his
chair
and
paced
up
and
down
the
room
he
stopped
to
bang
the
conference
table
with
a
knotted
fist
you
ca
do
it
he
bawled
at
them
you
ca
kill
the
project
i
there
something
to
it
we
ca
give
it
up
but
it
been
ten
years
general
said
the
secretary
of
the
army
if
they
were
coming
back
they
be
here
by
now
the
general
stopped
his
pacing
stiffened
who
did
that
little
civilian
squirt
think
he
was
talking
to
the
military
in
that
tone
of
voice
we
know
how
you
feel
about
it
general
said
the
chairman
of
the
joint
chiefs
of
staff
i
think
we
all
recognize
how
deeply
involved
you
blamed
yourself
all
these
years
and
there
is
no
need
of
it
after
all
there
may
be
nothing
to
it
sir
said
the
general
i
there
something
to
it
i
thought
so
at
the
time
even
when
no
one
else
did
and
what
turned
up
since
serves
to
bear
me
out
let
take
a
look
at
these
three
men
of
ours
we
knew
almost
nothing
of
them
at
the
time
but
we
know
them
now
i
traced
out
their
lives
from
the
time
that
they
were
born
until
they
disappeared
and
i
might
add
that
on
the
chance
it
might
be
all
a
hoax
we
searched
for
them
for
years
and
we
found
no
trace
at
all
i
talked
with
those
who
knew
them
and
i
studied
their
scholastic
and
military
records
i
arrived
at
the
conclusion
that
if
any
three
men
could
do
it
they
were
the
ones
who
could
adams
was
the
brains
and
the
other
two
were
the
ones
who
carried
out
the
things
that
he
dreamed
up
cooper
was
a
bulldog
sort
of
man
who
could
keep
them
going
and
it
would
be
hudson
who
would
figure
out
the
angles
and
they
knew
the
angles
gentlemen
they
had
it
all
doped
out
what
hudson
tried
here
in
washington
is
substantial
proof
of
that
but
even
back
in
school
they
were
thinking
of
those
angles
i
talked
some
years
ago
to
a
lawyer
in
new
york
name
of
pritchard
he
told
me
that
even
back
in
university
they
talked
of
the
economic
and
political
problems
that
they
might
face
if
they
ever
cracked
what
they
were
working
at
wesley
adams
was
one
of
our
brightest
young
scientific
men
his
record
at
the
university
and
his
war
work
bears
that
out
after
the
war
there
were
at
least
a
dozen
jobs
he
could
have
had
but
he
was
interested
and
i
tell
you
why
he
was
he
had
something
bigger
something
he
wanted
to
work
on
so
he
and
these
two
others
went
off
by
themselves
you
think
he
was
working
on
a
temporal
the
army
secretary
cut
in
he
was
working
on
a
time
machine
roared
the
general
i
know
about
this
business
just
plain
machine
is
good
enough
for
me
let
calm
down
general
said
the
jcs
chairman
after
all
there
no
need
to
shout
the
general
nodded
i
sorry
sir
i
get
all
worked
up
about
this
i
spent
the
last
ten
years
with
it
as
you
say
trying
to
make
up
for
what
i
failed
to
do
ten
years
ago
i
should
have
talked
to
hudson
i
was
busy
sure
but
not
that
busy
an
official
state
of
mind
that
we
too
busy
to
see
anyone
and
i
plead
guilty
on
that
score
and
now
that
you
talking
about
closing
the
project
it
costing
us
money
said
the
army
secretary
and
we
have
no
direct
evidence
pointed
out
the
jcs
chairman
i
do
know
what
you
want
snapped
the
general
if
there
was
any
man
alive
who
could
crack
time
that
man
was
wesley
adams
we
found
where
he
worked
we
found
the
workshop
and
we
talked
to
neighbors
who
said
there
was
something
funny
going
on
and
but
ten
years
general
the
army
secretary
protested
hudson
came
here
bringing
us
the
greatest
discovery
in
all
history
and
we
kicked
him
out
after
that
do
you
expect
them
to
come
crawling
back
to
us
you
think
they
went
to
someone
else
they
would
do
that
they
know
what
the
thing
they
have
found
would
mean
they
would
sell
us
out
hudson
came
with
a
preposterous
proposition
said
the
man
from
the
state
department
they
had
to
protect
themselves
yelled
the
general
if
you
had
discovered
a
virgin
planet
with
its
natural
resources
intact
what
would
you
do
about
it
come
trotting
down
here
and
hand
it
over
to
a
government
that
too
to
recognize
general
yes
sir
apologized
the
general
tiredly
i
wish
you
gentlemen
could
see
my
view
of
it
how
it
all
fits
together
first
there
were
the
films
and
we
have
the
word
of
a
dozen
competent
paleontologists
that
it
impossible
to
fake
anything
as
perfect
as
those
films
but
even
granting
that
they
could
be
there
are
certain
differences
that
no
one
would
ever
think
of
faking
because
no
one
ever
knew
who
as
an
example
would
put
lynx
tassels
on
the
ears
of
a
who
would
know
that
young
mastodon
were
black
and
the
location
i
wonder
if
you
forgotten
that
we
tracked
down
the
location
of
adams
workshop
from
those
films
alone
they
gave
us
clues
so
positive
that
we
did
even
hesitate
we
drove
straight
to
the
old
deserted
farm
where
adams
and
his
friends
had
worked
do
you
see
how
it
all
fits
together
i
presume
the
man
from
the
state
department
said
nastily
that
you
even
have
an
explanation
as
to
why
they
chose
that
particular
location
you
thought
you
had
me
there
said
the
general
but
i
have
an
answer
a
good
one
the
southwestern
corner
of
wisconsin
is
a
geologic
curiosity
it
was
missed
by
all
the
glaciations
why
we
do
not
know
whatever
the
reason
the
glaciers
came
down
on
both
sides
of
it
and
far
to
the
south
of
it
and
left
it
standing
there
a
little
island
in
a
sea
of
ice
and
another
thing
except
for
a
time
in
the
triassic
that
same
area
of
wisconsin
has
always
been
dry
land
that
and
a
few
other
spots
are
the
only
areas
in
north
america
which
have
not
time
and
time
again
been
covered
by
water
i
do
think
it
necessary
to
point
out
the
comfort
it
would
be
to
an
experimental
traveler
in
time
to
be
certain
that
in
almost
any
era
he
might
hit
he
have
dry
land
beneath
him
the
economics
expert
spoke
up
we
given
this
matter
a
lot
of
study
and
while
we
do
not
feel
ourselves
competent
to
rule
upon
the
possibility
or
impossibility
of
time
travel
there
are
some
observations
i
should
like
at
some
time
to
make
go
ahead
right
now
said
the
jcs
chairman
we
see
one
objection
to
the
entire
matter
one
of
the
reasons
naturally
that
we
had
some
interest
in
it
is
that
if
true
it
would
give
us
an
entire
new
planet
to
exploit
perhaps
more
wisely
than
we
done
in
the
past
but
the
thought
occurs
that
any
planet
has
only
a
certain
grand
total
of
natural
resources
if
we
go
into
the
past
and
exploit
them
what
effect
will
that
have
upon
what
is
left
of
those
resources
for
use
in
the
present
we
in
doing
this
be
robbing
ourselves
of
our
own
heritage
that
contention
said
the
aec
chairman
would
hold
true
in
every
case
quite
the
reverse
in
fact
we
know
that
there
was
in
some
geologic
ages
in
the
past
a
great
deal
more
uranium
than
we
have
today
go
back
far
enough
and
you
catch
that
uranium
before
it
turned
into
lead
in
southwestern
wisconsin
there
is
a
lot
of
lead
hudson
told
us
he
knew
the
location
of
vast
uranium
deposits
and
we
thought
he
was
a
crackpot
talking
through
his
hat
if
known
let
be
fair
about
this
if
we
had
known
and
believed
him
about
going
back
in
time
we
have
snapped
him
up
at
once
and
all
this
would
not
have
happened
it
would
hold
true
with
forests
either
said
the
chairman
of
the
jcs
or
with
pastures
or
with
crops
the
economics
expert
was
slightly
flushed
there
is
another
thing
he
said
if
we
go
back
in
time
and
colonize
the
land
we
find
there
what
would
happen
when
that
well
let
call
it
retroactive
when
that
retroactive
civilization
reaches
the
beginning
of
our
historic
period
what
will
result
from
that
cultural
collision
will
our
history
change
is
what
has
happened
false
is
all
that
all
poppycock
the
general
shouted
that
and
this
other
talk
about
using
up
resources
whatever
we
did
in
the
past
or
are
about
to
do
has
been
done
already
i
lain
awake
nights
mister
thinking
about
all
these
things
and
there
is
no
answer
believe
me
except
the
one
i
give
you
the
question
which
faces
us
here
is
an
immediate
one
do
we
give
all
this
up
or
do
we
keep
on
watching
that
wisconsin
farm
waiting
for
them
to
come
back
do
we
keep
on
trying
to
find
independently
the
process
or
formula
or
method
that
adams
found
for
traveling
in
time
we
had
no
luck
in
our
research
so
far
general
said
the
quiet
physicist
who
sat
at
the
table
end
if
you
were
not
so
sure
and
if
the
evidence
were
not
so
convincing
that
it
had
been
done
by
adams
i
say
flatly
that
it
is
impossible
we
have
no
approach
which
holds
any
hope
at
all
what
we
done
so
far
you
might
best
describe
as
flounder
but
if
adams
turned
the
trick
it
must
be
possible
there
may
be
as
a
matter
of
fact
more
ways
than
one
we
like
to
keep
on
trying
not
one
word
of
blame
has
been
put
on
you
for
your
failure
the
chairman
told
the
physicist
that
you
could
do
it
seems
to
be
more
than
can
be
humanly
expected
if
adams
did
it
he
did
i
say
it
must
have
been
simply
that
he
blundered
on
an
avenue
of
research
no
other
man
has
thought
of
you
will
recall
said
the
general
that
the
research
program
even
from
the
first
was
thought
of
strictly
as
a
gamble
our
one
hope
was
and
must
remain
that
they
will
return
it
would
have
been
so
much
simpler
all
around
the
state
department
man
said
if
adams
had
patented
his
method
the
general
raged
at
him
and
had
it
published
all
neat
and
orderly
in
the
patent
office
records
so
that
anyone
who
wanted
it
could
look
it
up
and
have
it
we
can
be
most
sincerely
thankful
said
the
chairman
that
he
did
not
patent
it
vi
the
helicopter
would
never
fly
again
but
the
time
unit
was
intact
which
did
mean
that
it
would
work
they
held
a
powwow
at
their
camp
site
it
had
been
they
decided
simpler
to
move
the
camp
than
to
remove
the
body
of
old
buster
so
they
had
shifted
at
dawn
leaving
the
old
mastodon
still
sprawled
across
the
helicopter
in
a
day
or
two
they
knew
the
great
bones
would
be
cleanly
picked
by
the
carrion
birds
the
lesser
cats
the
wolves
and
foxes
and
the
little
skulkers
getting
the
time
unit
out
of
the
helicopter
had
been
quite
a
chore
but
they
finally
had
managed
and
now
adams
sat
with
it
cradled
in
his
lap
the
worst
of
it
he
told
them
is
that
i
ca
test
it
no
way
to
you
turn
it
on
and
it
works
or
it
does
work
you
ca
know
till
you
try
that
something
we
ca
help
cooper
replied
the
problem
seems
to
me
is
how
we
going
to
use
it
without
the
whirlybird
we
have
to
figure
out
some
way
to
get
up
in
the
air
said
adams
we
do
want
to
take
the
chance
of
going
up
into
the
twentieth
century
and
arriving
there
about
six
feet
underground
common
sense
says
that
we
should
be
higher
here
than
up
ahead
hudson
pointed
out
these
hills
have
stood
here
since
jurassic
times
they
probably
were
a
good
deal
higher
then
and
have
weathered
down
that
weathering
still
should
be
going
on
so
we
should
be
higher
here
than
in
the
twentieth
century
not
much
perhaps
but
higher
did
anyone
ever
notice
what
the
altimeter
read
asked
cooper
i
do
believe
i
did
adams
admitted
it
would
tell
you
anyhow
hudson
declared
it
would
just
give
our
height
then
and
now
and
we
were
moving
remember
and
what
about
air
pockets
and
relative
atmosphere
density
and
all
the
rest
cooper
looked
as
discouraged
as
hudson
felt
how
does
this
sound
asked
adams
we
build
a
platform
twelve
feet
high
that
certainly
should
be
enough
to
clear
us
and
yet
small
enough
to
stay
within
the
range
of
the
unit
and
what
if
we
two
feet
higher
here
hudson
pointed
out
a
fall
of
fourteen
feet
would
kill
a
man
unless
he
plain
unlucky
it
might
break
some
bones
so
it
might
break
some
bones
you
want
to
stay
here
or
take
a
chance
on
a
broken
leg
all
right
if
you
put
it
that
way
a
platform
you
say
a
platform
out
of
what
timber
there
lot
of
it
we
just
go
out
and
cut
some
logs
a
log
is
heavy
and
how
are
we
going
to
get
that
big
a
log
uphill
we
drag
it
we
try
to
you
mean
maybe
we
could
fix
up
a
cart
said
adams
after
thinking
a
moment
out
of
what
cooper
asked
rollers
maybe
we
could
cut
some
and
roll
the
logs
up
here
that
would
work
on
level
ground
hudson
said
it
would
work
to
roll
a
log
uphill
it
would
get
away
from
us
someone
might
get
killed
the
logs
would
have
to
be
longer
than
twelve
feet
anyhow
cooper
put
in
you
have
to
set
them
in
a
hole
and
that
takes
away
some
footage
why
not
the
tripod
principle
hudson
offered
fasten
three
logs
at
the
top
and
raise
them
that
a
a
primitive
derrick
it
still
have
to
be
longer
than
twelve
feet
fifteen
sixteen
maybe
and
how
are
we
going
to
hoist
three
logs
we
need
a
block
and
tackle
there
another
thing
said
cooper
part
of
those
logs
might
just
be
beyond
the
effective
range
of
the
part
of
them
would
have
to
mind
you
move
in
time
and
part
could
that
would
set
up
a
stress
another
thing
about
it
added
hudson
is
that
we
travel
with
the
logs
i
do
want
to
come
out
in
another
time
with
a
bunch
of
logs
flying
all
around
me
cheer
up
adams
told
them
maybe
the
unit
wo
work
anyhow
vii
the
general
sat
alone
in
his
office
and
held
his
head
between
his
hands
the
fools
he
thought
the
goddam
fools
why
could
they
see
it
as
clearly
as
he
did
for
fifteen
years
now
as
head
of
project
mastodon
he
had
lived
with
it
night
and
day
and
he
could
see
all
the
possibilities
as
clearly
as
if
they
had
been
actual
fact
not
military
possibilities
alone
although
as
a
military
man
he
naturally
would
think
of
those
first
the
hidden
bases
for
example
located
within
the
very
strongholds
of
potential
enemies
within
yet
centuries
removed
in
time
many
centuries
removed
and
only
seconds
distant
he
could
see
it
all
the
materialization
of
the
fleets
the
swift
devastating
blow
then
the
instantaneous
retreat
into
the
fastnesses
of
the
past
terrific
destruction
but
not
a
ship
lost
nor
a
man
except
that
if
you
had
the
bases
you
need
never
strike
the
blow
if
you
had
the
bases
and
let
the
enemy
know
you
had
them
there
would
never
be
the
provocation
and
on
the
home
front
you
have
shelters
that
would
be
effective
you
evacuate
your
population
not
in
space
but
time
you
have
the
sure
and
absolute
defense
against
any
kind
of
bombing
fission
fusion
bacteriological
or
whatever
else
the
labs
had
in
stock
and
if
the
worst
should
come
which
it
never
would
with
a
setup
like
that
you
have
a
place
to
which
the
entire
nation
could
retreat
leaving
to
the
enemy
the
empty
blasted
cities
and
the
lethally
dusted
countryside
sanctuary
that
had
been
what
hudson
had
offered
the
of
state
fifteen
years
ago
and
the
idiot
had
frozen
up
with
the
insult
of
it
and
had
hudson
thrown
out
and
if
war
did
not
come
think
of
the
living
space
and
the
vast
new
opportunities
not
the
least
of
which
would
be
the
opportunity
to
achieve
peaceful
living
in
a
virgin
world
where
the
old
hatreds
would
slough
off
and
new
concepts
have
a
chance
to
grow
he
wondered
where
they
were
those
three
who
had
gone
back
into
time
dead
perhaps
run
down
by
a
mastodon
or
stalked
by
tigers
or
maybe
done
in
by
warlike
tribesmen
no
he
kept
forgetting
there
were
any
in
that
era
or
trapped
in
time
unable
to
get
back
condemned
to
exile
in
an
alien
time
or
maybe
he
thought
just
plain
disgusted
and
he
could
blame
them
if
they
were
or
maybe
let
be
fantastic
about
this
sneaking
in
colonists
from
some
place
other
than
the
watched
wisconsin
farm
building
up
in
actuality
the
nation
they
had
claimed
to
be
they
had
to
get
back
to
the
present
soon
or
project
mastodon
would
be
killed
entirely
already
the
research
program
had
been
halted
and
if
something
did
happen
quickly
the
watch
that
was
kept
on
the
wisconsin
farm
would
be
called
off
and
if
they
do
that
said
the
general
i
know
just
what
do
he
got
up
and
strode
around
the
room
by
god
he
said
i
show
viii
it
had
taken
ten
full
days
of
work
to
build
the
pyramid
they
hauled
the
rocks
from
the
creek
bed
half
a
mile
away
and
had
piled
them
stone
by
rolling
stone
to
the
height
of
a
full
twelve
feet
it
took
a
lot
of
rocks
and
a
lot
of
patience
for
as
the
pyramid
went
up
the
base
naturally
kept
broadening
out
but
now
all
was
finally
ready
hudson
sat
before
the
campfire
and
held
his
blistered
hands
before
him
it
should
work
he
thought
better
than
the
logs
and
less
dangerous
grab
a
handful
of
sand
some
trickled
back
between
your
fingers
but
most
stayed
in
your
grasp
that
was
the
principle
of
the
pyramid
of
stones
when
and
if
the
time
machine
should
work
most
of
the
rocks
would
go
along
those
that
did
go
would
simply
trickle
out
and
do
no
harm
there
be
no
stress
or
strain
to
upset
the
working
of
the
and
if
the
time
unit
did
work
or
if
it
did
this
was
the
end
of
the
dream
thought
hudson
no
matter
how
you
looked
at
it
for
even
if
they
did
get
back
to
the
twentieth
century
there
would
be
no
money
and
with
the
film
lost
and
no
other
taken
to
replace
it
they
have
no
proof
they
had
traveled
back
beyond
the
dawn
of
history
back
almost
to
the
dawn
of
man
although
how
far
you
traveled
would
have
no
significance
an
hour
or
a
million
years
would
be
all
the
same
if
you
could
span
the
hour
you
could
span
the
million
years
and
if
you
could
go
back
the
million
years
it
was
within
your
power
to
go
back
to
the
first
tick
of
eternity
the
first
stir
of
time
across
the
face
of
emptiness
and
nothingness
back
to
that
initial
instant
when
nothing
as
yet
had
happened
or
been
planned
or
thought
when
all
the
vastness
of
the
universe
was
a
new
slate
waiting
the
first
chalk
stroke
of
destiny
another
helicopter
would
cost
thirty
thousand
dollars
and
they
did
even
have
the
money
to
buy
the
tractor
that
they
needed
to
build
the
stockade
there
was
no
way
to
borrow
you
could
walk
into
a
bank
and
say
you
wanted
thirty
thousand
to
take
a
trip
back
to
the
old
stone
age
you
still
could
go
to
some
industry
or
some
university
or
the
government
and
if
you
could
persuade
them
you
had
something
on
the
ball
why
then
they
might
put
up
the
cash
after
cutting
themselves
in
on
just
about
all
of
the
profits
and
naturally
they
run
the
show
because
it
was
their
money
and
all
you
had
done
was
the
sweating
and
the
bleeding
there
one
thing
that
still
bothers
me
said
cooper
breaking
the
silence
we
spent
a
lot
of
time
picking
our
spot
so
we
miss
the
barn
and
house
and
all
the
other
buildings
do
tell
me
the
windmill
hudson
cried
no
i
pretty
sure
we
clear
of
that
but
the
way
i
figure
we
right
astraddle
that
fence
at
the
south
end
of
the
orchard
if
you
want
we
could
move
the
pyramid
over
twenty
feet
or
so
cooper
groaned
i
take
my
chances
with
the
fence
adams
got
to
his
feet
the
time
unit
tucked
underneath
his
arm
come
on
you
guys
it
time
to
go
they
climbed
the
pyramid
gingerly
and
stood
unsteadily
at
its
top
adams
shifted
the
unit
around
clasped
it
to
his
chest
stand
around
close
he
said
and
bend
your
knees
a
little
it
may
be
quite
a
drop
go
ahead
said
cooper
press
the
button
adams
pressed
the
button
nothing
happened
the
unit
did
work
ix
the
chief
of
central
intelligence
was
when
he
finished
talking
you
sure
of
your
information
asked
the
president
president
said
the
cia
chief
i
never
been
more
sure
of
anything
in
my
entire
life
the
president
looked
at
the
other
two
who
were
in
the
room
a
question
in
his
eyes
the
jcs
chairman
said
it
checks
sir
with
everything
we
know
but
it
incredible
the
president
said
they
afraid
said
the
cia
chief
they
lie
awake
nights
they
become
convinced
that
we
on
the
verge
of
traveling
in
time
they
tried
and
failed
but
they
think
we
near
success
to
their
way
of
thinking
they
got
to
hit
us
now
or
never
because
once
we
actually
get
time
travel
they
know
their
up
but
we
dropped
project
mastodon
entirely
almost
three
years
ago
it
been
all
of
ten
years
since
we
stopped
the
research
it
was
years
ago
that
hudson
that
makes
no
difference
sir
they
convinced
we
dropped
the
project
publicly
but
went
underground
with
it
that
would
be
the
kind
of
strategy
they
could
understand
the
president
picked
up
a
pencil
and
doodled
on
a
pad
who
was
that
old
general
he
asked
the
one
who
raised
so
much
fuss
when
we
dropped
the
project
i
remember
i
was
in
the
senate
then
he
came
around
to
see
me
bowers
sir
said
the
jcs
chairman
that
right
what
became
of
him
retired
well
i
guess
it
does
make
any
difference
now
he
doodled
some
more
and
finally
said
gentlemen
it
looks
like
this
is
it
how
much
time
did
you
say
we
had
not
more
than
ninety
days
sir
maybe
as
little
as
thirty
the
president
looked
up
at
the
jcs
chairman
we
as
ready
said
the
chairman
as
we
will
ever
be
we
can
handle
them
i
think
there
will
of
course
be
some
i
know
said
the
president
could
we
bluff
asked
the
secretary
of
state
speaking
quietly
i
know
it
would
stick
but
at
least
we
might
buy
some
time
you
mean
hint
that
we
have
time
travel
the
secretary
nodded
it
would
work
said
the
cia
chief
tiredly
if
we
really
had
it
there
be
no
question
then
they
become
exceedingly
even
neighborly
if
they
were
sure
we
had
it
but
we
have
got
it
said
the
president
gloomily
x
the
two
hunters
trudged
homeward
late
in
the
afternoon
with
a
deer
slung
from
a
pole
they
carried
on
their
shoulders
their
breath
hung
visibly
in
the
air
as
they
walked
along
for
the
frost
had
come
and
any
day
now
they
knew
there
would
be
snow
i
worried
about
wes
said
cooper
breathing
heavily
taking
this
too
hard
we
got
to
keep
an
eye
on
him
let
take
a
rest
panted
hudson
they
halted
and
lowered
the
deer
to
the
ground
he
blames
himself
too
much
said
cooper
he
wiped
his
sweaty
forehead
there
is
any
need
to
all
of
us
walked
into
this
with
our
eyes
wide
open
he
kidding
himself
and
he
knows
it
but
it
gives
him
something
to
go
on
as
long
as
he
can
keep
busy
with
all
his
puttering
around
he
be
all
right
he
is
going
to
repair
the
time
unit
chuck
i
know
he
is
and
he
knows
it
too
he
has
got
the
tools
or
the
materials
back
in
the
workshop
he
might
have
a
chance
but
here
he
has
it
rough
on
him
it
rough
on
all
of
us
yes
but
we
did
get
a
brainstorm
that
marooned
two
old
friends
in
this
tail
end
of
nowhere
and
we
ca
make
him
swallow
it
when
we
say
that
it
okay
we
do
mind
at
all
that
a
lot
to
swallow
johnny
what
going
to
happen
to
us
chuck
we
got
ourselves
a
place
to
live
and
there
lots
to
eat
save
our
ammo
for
the
big
game
a
lot
of
eating
for
each
bullet
and
trap
the
smaller
animals
i
wondering
what
will
happen
when
the
flour
and
all
the
other
stuff
is
gone
we
do
have
too
much
of
it
because
we
always
figured
we
could
bring
in
more
we
live
on
meat
said
hudson
we
got
bison
by
the
million
the
plains
indians
lived
on
them
alone
and
in
the
spring
find
roots
and
in
the
summer
berries
and
in
the
fall
harvest
a
kinds
of
nuts
some
day
our
ammo
will
be
gone
no
matter
how
careful
we
are
with
it
bows
and
arrows
slingshots
spears
there
a
lot
of
beasts
here
i
would
want
to
stand
up
to
with
nothing
but
a
spear
we
wo
stand
up
to
them
we
duck
when
we
can
and
run
when
we
ca
duck
without
our
guns
we
no
lords
of
creation
not
in
this
place
if
we
going
to
live
we
have
to
recognize
that
fact
and
if
one
of
us
gets
sick
or
breaks
a
leg
or
we
do
the
best
we
can
nobody
lives
forever
but
they
were
talking
around
the
thing
that
really
bothered
them
hudson
told
himself
each
of
them
afraid
to
speak
the
thought
aloud
they
live
all
right
so
far
as
food
shelter
and
clothing
were
concerned
and
they
live
most
of
the
time
in
plenty
for
this
was
a
fat
and
land
and
a
man
could
make
an
easy
living
but
the
big
problem
the
one
they
were
afraid
to
talk
about
was
their
emptiness
of
purpose
to
live
they
had
to
find
some
meaning
in
a
world
without
society
a
man
cast
away
on
a
desert
isle
could
always
live
for
hope
but
here
there
was
no
hope
a
robinson
crusoe
was
separated
from
his
by
at
the
most
a
few
thousand
miles
here
they
were
separated
by
a
hundred
and
fifty
thousand
years
wes
adams
was
the
lucky
one
so
far
even
playing
his
shot
he
still
held
tightly
to
a
purpose
feeble
as
it
might
be
the
hope
that
he
could
repair
the
time
machine
we
do
need
to
watch
him
now
thought
hudson
the
time
have
to
watch
is
when
he
is
forced
to
admit
he
ca
fix
the
machine
and
both
hudson
and
cooper
had
been
kept
sane
enough
for
there
had
been
the
cabin
to
be
built
and
the
winter
supply
of
wood
to
cut
and
the
hunting
to
be
done
but
then
there
would
come
a
time
when
all
the
chores
were
finished
and
there
was
nothing
left
to
do
you
ready
to
go
asked
cooper
sure
all
rested
now
said
hudson
they
hoisted
the
pole
to
their
shoulders
and
started
off
again
hudson
had
lain
awake
nights
thinking
of
it
and
all
the
thoughts
had
been
dead
ends
one
could
write
a
natural
history
of
the
pleistocene
complete
with
photographs
and
sketches
and
it
would
be
a
pointless
thing
to
do
because
no
future
scientist
would
ever
have
a
chance
to
read
it
or
they
might
labor
to
build
a
memorial
a
vast
pyramid
perhaps
which
would
carry
a
message
forward
across
fifteen
hundred
centuries
snatching
with
bare
hands
at
a
semblance
of
immortality
but
if
they
did
they
would
be
working
against
the
sure
and
certain
knowledge
that
it
all
would
come
to
naught
for
they
knew
in
advance
that
no
such
pyramid
existed
in
historic
time
or
they
might
set
out
to
seek
contemporary
man
hiking
across
four
thousand
miles
of
wilderness
to
bering
strait
and
over
into
asia
and
having
found
contemporary
man
cowering
in
his
caves
they
might
be
able
to
help
him
immeasurably
along
the
road
to
his
great
inheritance
except
that
they
never
make
it
and
even
if
they
did
contemporary
man
undoubtedly
would
find
some
way
to
do
them
in
and
might
eat
them
in
the
bargain
they
came
out
of
the
woods
and
there
was
the
cabin
just
a
hundred
yards
away
it
crouched
against
the
hillside
above
the
spring
with
the
sweep
of
grassland
billowing
beyond
it
to
the
skyline
a
trickle
of
smoke
came
up
from
the
chimney
and
they
saw
the
door
was
open
wes
ought
to
leave
it
open
that
way
said
cooper
no
telling
when
a
bear
might
decide
to
come
visiting
hey
wes
yelled
hudson
but
there
was
no
sign
of
him
inside
the
cabin
a
white
sheet
of
paper
lay
on
the
table
top
hudson
snatched
it
up
and
read
it
with
cooper
at
his
shoulder
dear
guys
i
do
want
to
get
your
hopes
up
again
and
have
you
disappointed
but
i
think
i
may
have
found
the
trouble
i
going
to
try
it
out
if
it
does
work
i
come
back
and
burn
this
note
and
never
say
a
word
but
if
you
find
the
note
you
know
it
worked
and
i
be
back
to
get
you
wes
hudson
crumpled
the
note
in
his
hand
the
crazy
fool
he
gone
off
his
rocker
cooper
said
he
just
thought
the
same
thought
struck
them
both
and
they
bolted
for
the
door
at
the
corner
of
the
cabin
they
skidded
to
a
halt
and
stood
there
staring
at
the
ridge
above
them
the
pyramid
of
rocks
they
built
two
months
ago
was
gone
xi
the
crash
brought
leslie
bowers
ret
up
out
of
bed
about
two
feet
out
of
bed
old
muscles
tense
white
mustache
bristling
even
at
his
age
the
general
was
a
man
of
action
he
flipped
the
covers
back
swung
his
feet
out
to
the
floor
and
grabbed
the
shotgun
leaning
against
the
wall
muttering
he
blundered
out
of
the
bedroom
marched
across
the
dining
room
and
charged
into
the
kitchen
there
beside
the
door
he
snapped
on
the
switch
that
turned
on
the
floodlights
he
practically
took
the
door
off
its
hinges
getting
to
the
stoop
and
he
stood
there
bare
feet
gripping
the
planks
nightshirt
billowing
in
the
wind
the
shotgun
poised
and
ready
what
going
on
out
there
he
bellowed
there
was
a
tremendous
pile
of
rocks
resting
where
he
parked
his
car
one
crumpled
fender
and
a
drunken
headlight
peeped
out
of
the
rubble
a
man
was
clambering
carefully
down
the
jumbled
stones
making
a
detour
to
dodge
the
battered
fender
the
general
pulled
back
the
hammer
of
the
gun
and
fought
to
control
himself
the
man
reached
the
bottom
of
the
pile
and
turned
around
to
face
him
the
general
saw
that
he
was
hugging
something
tightly
to
his
chest
mister
the
general
told
him
your
explanation
better
be
a
good
one
that
was
a
car
and
this
was
the
first
time
i
was
set
for
a
night
of
sleep
since
my
tooth
quit
aching
the
man
just
stood
and
looked
at
him
who
in
thunder
are
you
roared
the
general
the
man
walked
slowly
forward
he
stopped
at
the
bottom
of
the
stoop
my
name
is
wesley
adams
he
said
i
wesley
adams
howled
the
general
my
god
man
where
have
you
been
all
these
years
well
i
do
imagine
you
believe
me
but
the
fact
is
we
been
waiting
for
you
for
long
years
or
rather
been
waiting
for
you
those
other
idiots
gave
up
i
waited
right
here
for
you
adams
for
the
last
three
years
ever
since
they
called
off
the
guard
adams
gulped
i
sorry
about
the
car
you
see
it
was
this
way
the
general
he
saw
was
beaming
at
him
fondly
i
had
faith
in
you
the
general
said
he
waved
the
shotgun
by
way
of
invitation
come
on
in
i
have
a
call
to
make
adams
stumbled
up
the
stairs
move
the
general
ordered
shivering
on
the
double
you
want
me
to
catch
my
death
of
cold
out
here
inside
he
fumbled
for
the
lights
and
turned
them
on
he
laid
the
shotgun
across
the
kitchen
table
and
picked
up
the
telephone
give
me
the
white
house
at
washington
he
said
yes
i
said
the
white
house
the
president
naturally
he
the
one
i
want
to
talk
to
yes
it
all
right
he
wo
mind
my
calling
him
sir
said
adams
tentatively
the
general
looked
up
what
is
it
adams
go
ahead
and
say
it
did
you
say
years
that
what
i
said
what
were
you
doing
all
that
time
adams
grasped
the
table
and
hung
on
but
it
was
yes
said
the
general
to
the
operator
yes
i
wait
he
held
his
hand
over
the
receiver
and
looked
inquiringly
at
adams
i
imagine
you
want
the
same
terms
as
before
terms
sure
recognition
point
four
aid
defense
pact
i
suppose
so
adams
said
you
got
these
saps
across
the
barrel
the
general
told
him
happily
you
can
get
anything
you
want
you
rate
it
too
after
what
you
done
and
the
bonehead
treatment
you
got
but
especially
for
not
selling
out

with
his
mighty
paw
cooper
kicked
him
in
the
ribs
an
equally
playful
gesture
tabby
snarled
at
him
show
your
teeth
at
me
will
you
said
cooper
raised
you
from
a
kitten
and
that
the
gratitude
you
show
do
it
just
once
more
and
i
belt
you
in
the
chops
tabby
lay
down
blissfully
and
began
to
wash
his
face
some
day
warned
hudson
that
cat
will
miss
a
meal
and
the
day
you
it
gentle
as
a
dove
cooper
assured
him
would
hurt
a
fly
well
one
thing
about
it
nothing
dares
to
bother
us
with
that
monstrosity
around
best
watchdog
there
ever
was
got
to
have
something
to
guard
all
this
stuff
we
got
when
wes
gets
back
we
be
millionaires
all
those
furs
and
ginseng
and
the
ivory
he
gets
back
he
be
back
quit
your
worrying
but
it
been
five
years
hudson
protested
he
be
back
something
happened
that
all
he
probably
working
on
it
right
now
could
be
that
he
messed
up
the
time
setting
when
he
repaired
the
unit
or
it
might
have
been
knocked
out
of
kilter
when
buster
hit
the
helicopter
that
would
take
a
while
to
fix
i
do
worry
that
he
wo
come
back
what
i
figure
out
is
why
did
he
go
and
leave
us
i
told
you
hudson
said
he
was
afraid
it
would
work
there
was
any
need
to
be
scared
of
that
we
never
would
have
laughed
at
him
no
of
course
we
would
then
what
he
scared
of
cooper
asked
if
the
unit
failed
and
we
knew
it
failed
wes
was
afraid
we
try
to
make
him
see
how
hopeless
and
insane
it
was
and
he
knew
probably
convince
him
and
then
all
his
hope
would
be
gone
and
he
wanted
to
hang
onto
that
johnny
he
wanted
to
hang
onto
his
hope
even
when
there
was
any
left
that
does
matter
now
said
cooper
what
counts
is
that
come
back
i
can
feel
it
in
my
bones
and
here
another
case
thought
hudson
of
hope
begging
to
be
allowed
to
go
on
living
god
he
thought
i
wish
i
could
be
that
blind
wes
is
working
on
it
right
now
said
cooper
confidently
xiv
he
was
not
he
alone
but
a
thousand
others
working
desperately
knowing
that
the
time
was
short
working
not
alone
for
two
men
trapped
in
time
but
for
the
peace
they
all
had
dreamed
about
that
the
whole
world
had
yearned
for
through
the
ages
for
to
be
of
any
use
it
was
imperative
that
they
could
zero
in
the
time
machines
they
meant
to
build
as
an
artilleryman
would
zero
in
a
battery
of
guns
that
each
time
machine
would
take
its
occupants
to
the
same
instant
of
the
past
that
their
operation
would
extend
over
the
same
period
of
time
to
the
exact
second
it
was
a
problem
of
control
and
calibration
starting
with
a
prototype
that
was
calibrated
as
its
finest
adjustment
for
jumps
of
years
project
mastodon
was
finally
under
way
