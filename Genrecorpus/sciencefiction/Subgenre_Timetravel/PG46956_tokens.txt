did
not
sit
still
at

always

rapidly
if

chapter
i
the
war
spirit
she
grand
exclaimed
ned
enthusiastically
uncle
jack
the
could
knock
any
other
ironclad
in
all
the
world
perhaps
she
could
growled
uncle
jack
somewhat
thoughtfully
glad
she
is
out
of
range
of
them
just
now
though
i
like
her
looks
as
she
is
it
is
best
for
them
too
they
were
standing
near
the
head
of
pier
number
one
north
river
gazing
at
the
great
ship
as
she
steamed
along
slowly
up
the
stream
those
double
turrets
make
her
as
tall
as
a
house
said
ned
nothing
else
like
her
see
the
long
noses
of
those
big
guns
that
what
i
came
for
replied
uncle
jack
i
wanted
to
see
her
and
now
i
have
seen
her
i
am
more
opposed
to
war
than
ever
i
going
to
join
the
peace
society
i
rather
join
the
navy
said
ned
but
if
a
shell
from
one
of
those
guns
should
burst
inside
of
another
ship
it
would
blow
her
no
responded
his
uncle
with
firmness
she
would
not
go
up
to
the
sky
she
would
go
down
to
the
bottom
of
the
deep
sea
she
could
do
it
anyhow
said
ned
not
explaining
which
of
the
two
ships
he
referred
to
it
was
evident
that
uncle
jack
was
too
deeply
interested
in
the
to
care
for
general
conversation
for
fear
however
that
he
might
not
have
read
the
papers
his
somewhat
excited
nephew
told
him
that
the
wonder
of
the
sea
had
at
least
twelve
thousand
horses
in
her
steam
engines
he
also
said
that
she
was
of
twelve
thousand
tons
burden
but
did
not
say
whether
that
was
the
load
she
could
carry
or
whether
it
might
be
supposed
to
be
her
fighting
weight
i
wish
i
were
captain
of
her
he
declared
at
last
i
like
to
conquer
england
i
felt
just
so
once
responded
uncle
jack
there
is
more
in
england
that
is
worth
capturing
than
there
is
anywhere
else
you
would
need
more
than
one
ship
though
i
tried
the
experiment
but
the
english
beat
me
oh
exclaimed
ned
i
know
how
you
tried
it
you
went
alone
though
and
without
any
no
said
his
uncle
i
did
go
alone
your
aunt
went
with
me
so
did
thousands
of
other
brave
americans
they
try
it
every
year
and
they
always
come
home
beaten
yes
sir
said
ned
they
spend
all
their
money
and
are
glad
to
get
back
they
say
the
english
can
whip
anything
in
all
the
world
except
americans
i
going
there
some
day
i
do
believe
there
is
any
british
ship
that
can
whip
the
she
certainly
is
magnificent
replied
his
uncle
she
is
a
tremendous
war
machine
what
we
are
ever
to
do
with
her
however
i
do
care
to
think
of
i
want
her
never
to
fire
one
of
those
guns
after
all
ned
if
one
of
her
great
steel
bottom
plates
should
get
shaken
loose
and
drop
out
that
vast
leviathan
would
sink
with
all
on
board
i
guess
not
said
ned
they
would
get
away
in
the
boats
besides
she
is
going
to
fall
to
pieces
right
away
all
right
said
his
uncle
we
seen
her
now
let
go
home
they
turned
away
and
walked
on
across
what
the
people
of
new
york
call
the
battery
they
do
so
because
here
was
a
fort
once
part
of
it
nearest
the
water
was
made
there
two
centuries
ago
another
part
more
like
a
modern
fort
was
made
later
and
it
was
distinguished
for
having
been
surrendered
back
and
forth
without
firing
one
of
its
guns
in
defence
more
times
than
any
other
military
post
in
america
it
was
given
up
once
by
the
dutch
twice
by
the
british
and
once
by
the
americans
that
was
by
general
washington
when
the
english
troops
drove
him
and
his
ragged
rebels
out
of
new
york
none
of
the
fighting
that
was
done
then
was
anywhere
near
the
battery
ned
had
something
to
say
about
that
as
they
went
along
and
about
the
other
forts
around
the
harbour
of
which
he
seemed
to
be
very
proud
my
boy
remarked
his
uncle
almost
all
of
our
new
york
forts
are
back
numbers
one
steel
canoe
like
the
if
she
were
english
for
instance
and
if
we
were
conquering
england
could
knock
all
of
those
affairs
about
our
ears
well
said
ned
doubtfully
so
the
or
the
could
do
for
any
old
fort
in
europe
i
say
uncle
jack
right
here
is
the
lower
end
of
all
the
elevated
railways
exactly
said
his
uncle
and
of
the
that
are
hauled
by
a
steel
rope
underground
away
up
yonder
is
the
suspension
bridge
from
this
city
to
brooklyn
there
will
be
a
dozen
of
them
more
or
less
before
long
all
over
the
upper
part
of
town
the
run
by
lightning
on
a
string
i
hate
all
these
modern
inventions
and
innovations
i
do
i
hate
railways
up
in
the
air
on
stilts
and
i
hate
express
trains
that
go
a
mile
a
minute
and
i
hate
these
electric
lights
why
ned
when
i
was
a
boy
we
were
able
to
get
candles
to
read
by
nobody
can
have
anything
of
that
kind
nowadays
now
just
look
at
those
buildings
fellows
who
live
at
the
top
of
those
things
have
to
be
shot
up
awful
i
went
up
four
of
them
said
ned
i
wanted
to
know
how
it
felt
well
said
uncle
jack
how
did
you
feel
i
held
my
breath
replied
ned
and
i
held
on
to
the
seat
i
was
glad
to
get
out
though
top
and
bottom
i
suppose
a
fellow
can
get
used
to
it
ned
interrupted
his
uncle
wait
here
a
minute
i
want
to
have
a
little
talk
with
a
friend
of
mine
in
chicago
what
they
wo
do
next
with
electricity
and
some
things
i
do
know
they
were
in
front
of
a
telephone
office
and
uncle
jack
went
in
his
conversation
with
his
neighbour
a
thousand
miles
away
turned
out
a
long
one
and
it
was
half
an
hour
before
he
and
his
nephew
reached
the
patch
of
cleared
land
which
still
remains
around
the
city
hall
there
suddenly
exclaimed
ned
hurrah
we
having
luck
uncle
jack
that
the
very
thing
i
been
wanting
to
see
it
was
not
another
building
this
time
and
it
was
not
altogether
an
innovation
it
was
something
warlike
and
terrible
for
a
battery
of
the
fourth
regular
artillery
guns
ammunition
wagons
all
was
passing
through
the
city
down
broadway
on
its
journey
to
some
new
post
of
duty
those
are
calibre
long
range
guns
said
uncle
jack
they
send
shells
ten
miles
or
so
to
split
things
the
are
longer
than
a
for
my
part
i
do
like
they
shoot
too
far
they
the
right
thing
to
have
said
ned
if
i
were
going
to
conquer
england
i
want
plenty
of
those
guns
they
be
of
no
use
at
all
to
you
if
you
had
them
said
uncle
jack
the
london
police
would
let
you
keep
they
take
them
right
away
from
you
as
soon
as
you
landed
you
would
be
fined
too
against
english
law
for
any
fellow
to
carry
such
things
around
with
him
ned
was
silenced
by
that
for
the
time
and
they
both
got
into
a
and
went
on
there
were
plenty
of
things
worth
seeing
all
along
but
the
car
was
so
crowded
with
passengers
that
they
were
packed
as
uncle
jack
complained
like
sardines
in
a
box
so
they
stood
still
and
hardly
saw
anything
when
at
last
they
stepped
out
and
walked
over
toward
one
of
the
gateways
of
central
park
he
growled
again
there
they
go
he
exclaimed
one
two
three
four
of
they
are
those
automobile
carriages
that
go
without
any
horses
i
like
a
horse
myself
that
is
if
he
a
good
one
and
pulls
well
in
harness
i
was
kicked
half
to
death
by
one
of
my
horses
once
i
think
he
had
some
kind
of
automobile
in
him
if
you
should
ever
happen
to
conquer
england
you
get
fine
horses
that
what
mother
says
replied
ned
she
a
good
american
now
but
she
was
born
in
england
she
says
they
have
the
best
horses
in
the
world
not
by
any
means
equal
to
ours
snapped
uncle
jack
ours
are
so
fine
that
we
are
going
to
preserve
some
of
them
for
specimens
after
we
get
so
that
all
our
riding
and
pulling
is
done
by
steam
and
electricity
we
shall
keep
pictures
of
them
too
and
statues
so
that
people
who
live
in
such
times
as
are
to
come
may
know
what
sort
of
animals
horses
used
to
be
uncle
jack
appeared
to
be
in
a
bad
state
of
mind
that
day
for
he
went
on
to
denounce
vigorously
a
long
list
of
things
he
even
went
so
far
as
to
condemn
the
entire
race
english
and
american
together
look
at
it
ned
he
said
with
energy
not
only
do
both
of
these
wretched
nations
come
down
to
this
new
state
of
things
themselves
including
the
newspapers
and
the
magazines
and
the
floods
of
books
but
they
are
clubbing
together
to
force
innovations
upon
all
the
rest
of
the
world
they
are
a
partnership
concern
now
and
which
of
them
is
the
meanest
i
do
know
the
british
are
choking
their
inventions
down
the
throats
of
china
india
africa
and
a
lot
of
other
unlucky
continents
and
islands
we
americans
are
working
in
the
same
way
with
cuba
and
porto
rico
and
the
philippines
and
magatapatanglew
where
on
earth
is
that
asked
ned
where
is
it
sadly
responded
his
uncle
shaking
his
head
i
really
do
know
nobody
else
knows
where
half
of
these
new
places
are
with
names
i
a
kind
of
notion
it
near
the
junction
what
junction
inquired
his
nephew
why
exclaimed
uncle
jack
the
junction
you
do
know
it
is
at
the
corner
where
the
congo
river
crosses
the
ganges
it
is
very
near
the
point
where
the
ural
mountains
pour
down
into
the
red
sea
ned
was
not
entirely
caught
and
mystified
this
time
for
he
promptly
replied
oh
i
know
where
that
is
i
been
to
grammar
school
i
know
it
down
near
the
custom
house
i
declare
said
his
uncle
boys
know
too
much
anyhow
nowadays
you
would
learn
a
great
deal
more
though
if
you
take
an
army
and
a
steamer
and
go
and
conquer
england
your
mother
has
dozens
of
cousins
there
too
but
you
had
better
buy
return
excursion
tickets
before
you
start
that
what
i
did
and
it
helped
me
to
get
back
home
let
go
to
dinner
it
about
said
ned
and
his
uncle
talked
along
as
they
went
i
like
the
english
for
one
thing
he
said
they
cook
good
dinners
i
hate
for
another
thing
though
if
you
go
to
an
english
you
have
to
wait
till
the
last
man
gets
there
before
they
will
give
you
anything
to
eat
i
conquered
them
a
little
on
that
anyhow
for
i
always
went
two
hours
late
myself
so
i
generally
had
to
wait
only
about
half
an
hour
or
so
ned
studied
that
matter
until
he
thought
he
understood
it
afterward
however
he
was
glad
to
be
an
american
when
his
own
dinner
came
to
the
table
exactly
on
time
so
did
he
and
his
uncle
a
long
walk
and
sightseeing
combined
with
plans
for
the
conquest
of
england
will
surely
prepare
a
healthy
boy
for
his
dinner
especially
if
he
is
somewhat
tall
for
his
age
and
burly
in
build
ned
was
not
quite
prepared
nevertheless
for
some
things
which
were
coming
upon
him
he
could
not
have
expected
reasonably
that
his
entire
family
would
set
him
up
for
a
mark
and
shoot
at
him
that
is
what
they
did
and
they
fired
at
him
from
all
around
the
table
hitting
him
ned
began
uncle
jack
i
heard
you
where
on
earth
did
you
learn
to
speak
norwegian
not
at
the
grammar
school
why
said
ned
i
got
it
from
old
erica
she
has
been
in
the
house
since
before
i
was
born
she
began
with
me
when
i
was
doing
my
first
words
of
any
kind
oh
said
uncle
jack
that
it
i
suppose
even
the
norway
babies
catch
it
that
way
i
see
said
his
father
it
is
about
the
same
way
with
your
latin
i
used
to
talk
latin
at
you
when
you
wore
frocks
you
are
pretty
well
up
in
it
for
a
boy
only
just
graduated
from
a
public
school
perhaps
it
may
be
of
use
to
you
some
day
but
i
am
afraid
that
your
norwegian
never
will
not
unless
he
should
go
there
if
he
ever
travels
said
his
mother
what
he
needs
to
do
now
is
to
get
out
into
the
country
he
has
been
cooped
up
in
the
city
and
held
down
over
his
books
long
enough
he
must
spend
a
few
weeks
at
his
grandfather
house
remarked
his
aunt
maria
with
a
severe
expression
he
must
go
fishing
his
health
requires
it
so
said
his
sisters
and
his
older
brothers
and
then
uncle
jack
gave
him
away
entirely
telling
of
ned
dealings
with
the
and
with
the
other
wonders
they
had
seen
that
morning
you
do
say
so
exclaimed
his
father
he
wishes
to
conquer
england
i
know
some
english
boys
that
could
make
him
wish
he
were
hiding
on
board
the
well
responded
ned
rebelliously
i
not
so
sure
about
that
captain
of
the
baseball
nine
i
in
on
football
too
i
can
fence
and
i
had
pat
mccool
for
a
boxing
master
oh
remarked
aunt
maria
now
i
know
that
is
why
you
came
home
limping
so
horridly
a
week
ago
saturday
you
had
a
pair
of
black
eyes
too
that
nothing
aunt
maria
interrupted
ned
that
was
jimmy
finley
we
were
boxing
barehanded
he
got
it
as
bad
as
i
did
too
edward
exclaimed
his
mother
that
is
shocking
it
is
like
fighting
and
you
have
been
talking
slang
too
well
mother
said
ned
respectfully
i
did
mean
to
but
jim
is
a
regular
rusher
to
hit
edward
said
his
father
slang
again
i
must
take
you
in
hand
myself
he
is
dreadful
whispered
one
of
his
sisters
he
called
sallie
hemans
a
bricktop
her
hair
is
red
i
see
how
it
is
continued
his
father
the
sooner
you
are
out
in
the
country
the
better
football
indeed
baseball
fencing
boxing
all
that
sort
of
thing
what
you
need
is
exercise
fishing
i
should
say
and
plenty
of
good
fresh
country
air
something
beside
books
and
school
i
tell
you
what
then
responded
ned
i
be
glad
enough
to
get
there
all
the
colts
i
rode
last
summer
be
a
year
older
now
going
to
try
and
see
if
they
can
send
me
to
grass
like
they
did
then
edward
what
grammar
groaned
his
aunt
his
grandmother
webb
will
attend
to
that
i
have
my
serious
doubts
remarked
uncle
jack
she
has
not
altogether
reformed
her
own
neighbourhood
the
country
is
the
place
for
him
however
if
he
is
sent
away
he
may
stir
up
a
war
with
england
and
it
would
be
expensive
from
that
the
table
talk
drifted
back
to
the
terrible
and
the
new
inventions
it
is
dreadful
remarked
uncle
jack
i
used
to
think
i
knew
generally
what
i
was
eating
but
i
have
given
it
up
they
have
invented
artificial
eggs
the
butter
we
get
is
a
mystery
they
make
almost
anything
out
of
corn
the
newspapers
are
printed
on
stuff
that
made
of
and
this
new
imitation
silver
is
nothing
but
potter
clay
boiled
down
somehow
it
tires
me
out
to
think
of
it
all
i
do
care
said
ned
hurrah
for
the
country
and
for
the
colts
and
for
some
fishing
chapter
ii
ned
webb
outing
your
grandmother
is
right
edward
i
agree
with
her
entirely
she
thinks
that
too
much
of
your
vacation
time
ought
not
to
be
spent
in
the
woods
and
it
must
not
be
i
wish
however
to
say
something
more
your
education
must
continue
without
too
great
an
interruption
there
are
ideas
which
i
intend
you
to
obtain
while
under
my
care
why
grandfather
exclaimed
ned
with
a
somewhat
puzzled
look
on
his
face
i
think
so
too
i
do
care
to
be
all
the
while
in
the
woods
i
want
to
do
some
fishing
exactly
said
his
grandfather
we
both
approve
of
that
you
may
have
all
the
rods
and
lines
you
need
but
you
must
not
forget
the
wise
saying
of
the
immortal
franklin
that
going
fishing
means
only
a
rod
and
line
with
a
worm
at
each
end
of
it
there
is
not
much
to
be
caught
in
green
lake
well
said
ned
i
guess
i
pull
in
something
suckers
and
bullheads
there
are
trout
and
perch
and
bass
and
pickerel
eels
too
suggested
his
grandfather
what
i
mean
is
practically
that
you
are
to
employ
a
part
of
each
day
among
your
books
i
especially
wish
you
to
acquire
a
rudimentary
acquaintance
with
the
history
of
the
world
you
live
in
yes
sir
i
know
what
that
is
said
ned
they
bored
us
with
it
awfully
at
school
number
i
had
to
be
examined
on
it
too
and
i
did
get
turned
down
ned
had
safely
reached
his
grandfather
house
in
the
country
it
was
a
large
and
handsome
mansion
they
two
were
now
in
the
library
on
the
morning
after
his
arrival
one
glance
at
the
ranges
of
bookcases
was
enough
to
afford
an
indication
of
the
old
gentleman
hobby
he
was
a
distinguished
member
of
the
historical
society
of
the
antediluvian
research
association
of
the
paleontological
the
paleozoic
and
of
several
other
brilliant
scientific
corporations
he
was
a
short
stocky
old
man
and
very
positive
in
his
manners
possibly
he
might
now
have
responded
even
severely
but
at
this
moment
a
tall
thin
woman
entered
the
library
edward
she
said
brushing
a
lot
of
dust
from
her
dress
i
been
going
over
that
for
you
you
may
pick
out
all
you
want
of
it
if
you
only
let
the
guns
alone
i
ca
let
you
play
with
gunpowder
your
grandfather
must
make
a
bookworm
of
you
either
oh
said
ned
i
was
thinking
of
that
worms
i
guess
i
know
where
to
dig
what
i
going
to
go
for
this
morning
is
the
horses
that
what
you
may
do
said
his
grandfather
somewhat
as
if
he
had
been
getting
orders
from
his
wife
you
better
fight
shy
of
that
sorrel
filly
though
she
might
pitch
you
over
her
head
why
edward
interposed
his
grandmother
you
rode
that
colt
a
good
many
times
last
vacation
she
better
broken
in
now
i
driven
her
myself
she
as
kind
and
gentle
as
a
kitten
but
she
playful
humph
remarked
the
old
gentleman
she
kicked
one
buggy
into
the
middle
of
next
week
i
wo
drive
her
there
was
more
to
be
said
but
ned
escaped
with
his
grandmother
to
go
and
take
a
look
at
the
it
was
in
a
closet
of
one
of
the
rooms
and
it
was
worth
any
boy
while
to
have
the
rummaging
of
that
closet
it
a
perfect
curiosity
shop
said
ned
as
he
stared
into
it
why
grandmother
he
must
have
been
a
tremendous
fisherman
so
he
was
she
said
when
he
was
a
younger
man
that
is
all
of
it
though
this
is
his
collection
of
all
the
implements
employed
by
civilised
and
uncivilised
tribes
for
catching
fish
it
is
sorted
very
well
but
that
other
side
is
packed
with
nets
and
spears
afraid
there
is
a
really
good
boat
for
you
on
green
lake
clumsy
things
anything
do
for
me
said
ned
i
a
sailor
do
you
know
the
other
day
i
went
to
see
the
the
new
she
a
giant
oh
dear
laughed
the
old
lady
if
your
grandfather
could
buy
her
at
auction
he
stow
her
away
in
this
closet
for
one
of
his
specimens
i
can
see
all
i
want
replied
ned
i
come
and
pick
it
out
by
and
by
may
i
go
to
the
barns
now
go
right
along
she
said
had
you
better
take
a
ride
to
green
lake
it
only
a
mile
or
so
and
horseback
exercise
do
you
good
she
kept
him
a
few
minutes
however
to
explain
the
nature
of
some
of
the
more
remarkable
antiquities
in
the
closet
then
he
was
again
but
he
was
not
a
free
boy
yet
for
his
grandfather
caught
him
and
led
him
into
the
library
again
edward
he
said
solemnly
as
they
passed
the
doorway
if
there
is
anything
i
disapprove
of
more
than
another
it
is
what
they
are
printing
nowadays
to
occupy
the
empty
minds
of
the
young
the
things
which
they
advertise
as
popular
books
for
boys
for
instance
i
find
that
even
where
they
are
more
or
less
historical
in
character
they
are
also
perniciously
imaginative
often
presenting
utter
improbabilities
as
history
i
will
show
you
something
now
that
will
be
worth
your
while
i
suppose
that
you
do
not
know
anything
of
consequence
concerning
your
scandinavian
forefathers
yes
i
do
said
ned
our
old
erica
a
norway
girl
i
can
talk
with
her
in
norwegian
what
exclaimed
his
grandfather
have
you
actually
acquired
the
difficult
tongue
of
the
vikings
and
berserkers
that
is
wonderful
then
you
will
be
doubly
interested
in
the
work
you
are
about
to
peruse
i
guess
i
can
swallow
it
said
ned
are
you
going
to
give
me
a
look
at
it
the
old
gentleman
walked
over
to
a
corner
of
the
library
and
pulled
out
from
one
of
the
lower
shelves
an
exceedingly
promising
or
portentous
volume
he
was
a
strong
man
and
he
lifted
it
to
the
throwing
it
wide
open
as
he
did
so
and
remarking
there
now
that
a
book
for
a
boy
ned
drew
a
long
breath
in
spite
of
some
dust
that
flew
from
the
book
as
he
came
to
the
table
examine
it
said
his
grandfather
ned
turned
first
to
the
of
course
to
see
what
it
was
history
of
the
normans
by
professor
schweinfurth
bfjornnssen
translated
by
baron
fritz
von
plokinwicz
illustrations
published
by
drontheim
westminster
boston
and
copenhagen
a
pencilled
memorandum
added
pp
this
is
just
the
thing
exclaimed
ned
i
can
look
at
every
picture
in
it
while
i
here
i
guess
not
many
of
are
photos
though
they
are
splendid
illustration
is
any
about
this
they
are
works
of
art
all
of
said
his
grandfather
i
believe
them
to
be
sufficiently
accurate
and
that
you
may
depend
upon
their
instructive
value
i
see
said
ned
all
about
ever
so
many
fights
i
go
right
into
it
tell
you
what
grandfather
there
is
any
about
this
the
old
gentleman
was
evidently
gratified
by
the
eagerness
with
which
ned
began
to
turn
over
the
leaves
and
he
remarked
benevolently
it
will
give
you
a
thorough
knowledge
of
men
and
times
whereof
we
have
as
yet
discovered
very
little
the
vikings
were
a
wonderful
race
of
men
they
fight
like
anything
said
ned
pirates
buccaneers
freebooters
i
like
to
see
one
of
their
battles
they
blew
horns
all
the
while
yelled
sung
songs
yes
sir
it
the
biggest
kind
of
book
go
now
said
his
grandfather
still
more
delighted
with
enthusiasm
you
may
try
the
sorrel
colt
but
be
careful
the
barns
and
stables
of
the
webb
place
were
at
some
distance
in
the
rear
of
the
mansion
at
the
right
of
the
largest
barn
was
a
paddock
but
it
did
not
seem
to
have
many
occupants
at
this
hour
of
the
day
all
were
away
at
their
farm
duties
the
were
in
their
stalls
waiting
for
orders
all
that
ned
saw
therefore
on
his
arrival
were
a
brace
of
very
young
colts
four
devon
calves
as
handsome
as
pictures
and
one
sorrel
filly
she
was
in
the
hands
of
a
groom
and
instead
of
a
halter
she
was
wearing
a
bridle
with
a
plain
just
at
this
moment
the
groom
was
putting
upon
her
back
a
pretty
blue
blanket
with
white
borders
she
was
a
large
animal
for
her
age
and
ned
was
already
aware
that
she
had
earned
a
reputation
as
a
racer
there
speed
in
her
he
remarked
she
show
time
one
of
these
days
temper
well
i
do
care
if
there
is
good
horses
always
have
some
nanny
beautiful
eyes
looked
gentle
enough
and
they
were
full
of
intelligence
she
neighed
inquiringly
as
he
drew
nearer
hullo
how
are
ye
masther
ned
hark
to
the
mare
now
she
the
name
of

and
spake
to
her
how

pat
mccarty
called
back
ned
nanny
looking
fine
grandfather

i
may
ride
her
all
right
said
pat
she
ready
i
was
goin
to
exercise
her
meself
a
dozen
more
questions
and
answers
followed
rapidly
while
ned
was
caressing
and
admiring
the
perfectly
shaped
quadruped
she
turned
her
pretty
head
to
look
at
him
as
he
walked
around
her
and
he
was
aware
of
a
curious
notion
that
she
was
now
and
then
winking
at
him
she
seemed
at
the
same
time
a
little
impatient
and
restless
as
if
it
irritated
her
to
have
to
stand
still
you
do
as
well
without
a
saddle
said
pat
sometimes
she
objects
to
a
saddle
the
blanket
and
surcingle
is
all
the
summer
goods
she
wants
to
wear
guess
they
enough
laughed
ned
he
was
getting
wildly
eager
for
his
romp
with
nanny
whether
or
not
she
remembered
him
she
seemed
to
be
disposed
to
treat
him
politely
she
even
craned
out
her
neck
and
pulled
off
his
hat
for
him
taking
the
brim
in
her
teeth
she
friendly
the
day
said
pat
put
your
fut
in
me
hand
and
give
ye
the
lift
to
the
back
of
her
ned
was
as
nimble
as
a
monkey
in
a
moment
more
he
was
on
nanny
back
bridle
in
hand
feeling
splendidly
aff
wid
ye
said
pat
i
open
the
gate
for
ye
ave
she
wants
to
go
though
it
little
good
to
thry
an
hould
her
in
i
wo
said
ned
i
just
let
her
fly
he
was
thrilling
all
over
with
the
excitement
of
being
so
well
mounted
and
he
really
knew
how
to
ride
as
for
nanny
she
appeared
to
be
set
on
springs
and
her
progress
to
the
gate
was
a
series
of
graceful
curvetings
as
easy
for
her
rider
as
the
motion
of
a
they
were
now
in
the
barnyard
and
a
lane
from
this
led
out
into
the
road
pat
was
no
longer
needed
for
the
yard
gate
was
open
and
nanny
pranced
along
through
without
any
guiding
luk
at
her
shouted
pat
she
out
for
fun
the
day
she
full
life
oh
but
is
she
a
beauty
whoop
yelled
ned
this
is
better
than
being
shut
up
in
a
grammar
school
it
the
fine
he
is
ave
they
do
spile
him
entirely
among
thim
remarked
pat
thoughtfully
the
ould
grandmother
give
him
the
house
and
all
and
the
grandfather
been
just
for
him
till
he
kem
they
the
right
sort
o
people
thim
webbs
the
highway
was
clear
and
nanny
went
into
it
at
her
own
gait
a
kind
of
springing
elastic
canter
that
was
not
at
first
very
rapid
this
is
the
road
toward
green
lake
thought
ned
it
just
the
one
i
meant
to
take
i
get
there
or
next
day
and
see
if
there
any
fishing
sometimes
they
did
bite
worth
a
cent
last
year
i
find
a
boat
somehow
i
can
take
a
book
along
too
then
i
wo
have
to
sit
still
for
an
hour
at
a
time
doing
nothing
men
and
women
in
wagons
and
carriages
which
he
shortly
met
or
passed
all
turned
for
a
look
at
nanny
and
it
was
quite
apparent
that
she
appreciated
their
admiration
two
or
three
times
indeed
she
induced
ned
to
make
a
mild
restraining
pull
upon
the
bridle
but
each
time
she
resented
his
attempt
at
control
by
a
shake
of
her
head
followed
by
a
vigorous
bound
forward
i
better
take
pat
advice
he
thought
if
she
wants
to
speed
it
i
let
her
go
i
can
stick
on
anyhow
he
had
no
doubt
whatever
on
that
point
and
was
not
at
all
nervous
at
the
end
of
less
than
of
a
mile
however
there
was
a
narrow
lane
that
left
the
highway
on
the
right
though
not
at
right
angles
this
lane
was
bordered
by
rail
fences
trees
bushes
and
farther
on
it
led
through
a
patch
of
dense
forest
green
lake
lane
thought
ned
i
wo
go
there
on
that
point
he
should
have
first
consulted
the
sorrel
colt
under
him
the
instant
she
came
to
the
head
of
the
lane
she
uttered
a
sharp
exclamation
and
whirled
gaily
into
it
ned
at
once
drew
upon
his
bridle
in
an
attempt
to
guide
her
back
into
the
highway
up
went
her
heels
a
little
viciously
and
her
easy
gallop
changed
into
something
like
a
run
if
she
had
now
only
a
to
go
she
was
determined
to
make
short
work
of
whatever
errand
was
in
her
mind
she
going
like
lightning
exclaimed
ned
clinging
his
best
and
pulling
hard
this
lane
runs
right
on
into
the
lake
oh
my
faster
faster
went
the
beautiful
thoroughbred
racer
the
trees
at
the
roadside
seemed
to
go
flashing
by
and
now
the
lake
itself
was
in
full
view
ahead
it
was
a
broad
placid
sheet
of
water
apparently
somewhat
irregular
in
shape
there
were
neither
wharves
nor
piers
nor
boathouses
to
be
seen
the
entire
lake
landscape
was
wildly
picturesque
if
ned
could
at
that
moment
have
considered
at
all
any
of
the
beauties
of
nature
he
could
not
have
done
so
for
it
seemed
to
him
that
nanny
was
not
even
giving
him
time
to
think
long
afterward
he
remembered
asking
himself
if
it
were
possible
that
nanny
had
any
idea
of
going
for
a
swim
illustration
ned
did
not
sit
still
at
all
she
had
no
such
intentions
indeed
she
had
other
plans
and
purposes
and
she
carried
out
her
own
conception
of
a
grand
morning
romp
with
ned
to
perfection
the
moderate
slope
to
the
water
edge
was
green
with
grass
and
the
little
waves
came
rippling
in
smilingly
the
water
there
was
not
very
shallow
however
on
on
sprang
swiftly
the
sorrel
colt
and
it
was
plain
that
only
the
lake
itself
could
stop
her
that
is
the
bridle
and
bit
were
of
no
account
but
she
could
stop
herself
her
round
yellow
fore
hoofs
came
down
side
by
side
at
the
margin
and
the
water
was
only
a
few
inches
above
her
silken
fetlocks
when
she
suddenly
sharply
braced
herself
as
still
as
if
she
had
been
instantaneously
cast
in
bronze
for
exhibition
ned
did
not
sit
still
at
all
he
was
cast
clean
over
the
gracefully
bowing
head
of
the
playful
nanny
right
into
green
lake
as
far
as
she
could
throw
him
beyond
all
doubt
she
had
accomplished
her
purposes
remarkably
well
there
was
no
actual
harm
done
to
her
rider
either
for
the
water
in
which
ned
landed
if
a
boy
can
correctly
be
said
to
land
in
water
was
fully
four
feet
deep
he
went
into
it
head
first
heels
up
hat
flying
with
a
kind
of
astonished
yell
in
his
throat
that
was
drowned
before
it
could
get
away
from
him
when
he
came
to
the
surface
again
and
struck
out
for
the
shore
recapturing
his
floating
hat
on
the
way
there
stood
nanny
entirely
calm
and
as
gentle
as
ever
now
again
he
could
almost
have
believed
that
she
was
winking
at
him
she
neighed
very
kindly
drank
some
lake
water
and
then
she
lifted
her
head
and
gazed
around
the
lake
as
if
she
enjoyed
the
scenery
i
can
mount
her
again
asserted
ned
as
he
stood
still
to
drip
oh
but
ai
i
glad
i
lighted
on
something
soft
it
was
a
fair
throw
anyhow
i
had
anything
left
to
hold
on
with
whatever
he
meant
by
that
she
had
slung
him
over
her
head
and
there
was
very
little
doubt
but
what
she
could
do
it
again
she
had
a
will
of
her
own
too
as
to
being
ridden
and
she
as
much
as
said
so
when
he
went
to
get
hold
of
her
bridle
intending
to
lead
her
to
a
neighbouring
log
and
remount
he
did
not
succeed
in
putting
a
hand
on
the
leather
up
went
her
heels
around
she
whirled
and
away
she
went
neighing
cheerfully
as
she
galloped
along
the
lane
now
this
is
too
bad
groaned
ned
i
as
wet
as
a
drowned
rat
and
i
got
to
foot
it
home
nanny
get
there
before
i
do
too
unless
she
runs
away
somewhere
else
and
they
all
wonder
what
become
of
me
he
felt
humiliated
discouraged
and
not
at
all
like
the
kind
of
fellow
to
command
ironclads
and
lead
armies
there
was
nothing
else
to
be
done
nevertheless
and
he
began
to
trudge
dolefully
along
on
his
homeward
way
walking
in
wet
clothing
is
not
very
comfortable
exercise
anyhow
and
ned
was
not
now
by
any
means
the
young
man
from
the
city
that
he
had
been
when
he
rode
away
that
morning
even
more
than
before
when
he
was
so
well
mounted
did
curious
people
turn
in
their
carriages
and
wagons
to
stare
at
him
it
was
on
his
mind
that
every
one
of
them
had
a
good
laugh
and
remarked
that
chap
had
a
ducking
he
plodded
along
and
succeeded
in
getting
before
anything
serious
occurred
then
indeed
he
suddenly
stood
and
wished
he
had
been
farther
there
they
come
he
exclaimed
there
are
grandfather
and
grandmother
and
pat
and
old
emmons
and
uncle
jack
more
people
behind
oh
dear
they
seen
me
already
or
i
climb
a
fence
it
was
altogether
too
late
for
any
attempt
at
escape
in
a
few
moments
more
they
were
in
front
of
him
and
all
around
him
saying
all
sorts
of
things
so
rapidly
that
he
had
to
keep
shut
up
till
they
gave
him
a
chance
oh
my
blessed
boy
exclaimed
grandmother
webb
if
you
was
so
wet
i
hug
you
we
thought
the
colt
had
thrown
you
we
were
afraid
you
were
killed
no
said
ned
with
energy
but
she
fired
me
over
her
head
into
the
lake
and
i
swam
ashore
i
caught
her
put
in
pat
mccarty
here
she
is
the
beauty
that
was
for
thryin
to
hould
her
in
you
must
niver
do
that
i
did
pull
much
said
ned
uncle
jack
had
been
looking
him
all
over
critically
from
head
to
foot
that
lake
is
very
wet
he
remarked
ned
my
boy
i
glad
the
critter
projected
you
into
soft
water

out
of
it

bird

ned

blue
flannel
does
shrink
with
wetting
my
hat
be
all
right
as
soon
as
it
dry
so
my
shoes
at
that
moment
he
heard
a
shrill
soft
neigh
close
to
his
ear
and
nanny
poked
her
head
over
his
shoulder
to
gaze
affectionately
at
the
family
gathering
as
if
she
felt
that
she
was
entitled
to
some
of
the
credit
of
the
occasion
it
the
fun
of
her
said
pat
it
just
the
joke
she
played
on
the
she

ned

so
long
i
got
ashore
the
procession
set
out
for
the
house
pat
and
nanny
marching
ahead
it
grew
too
as
it
went
for
ever
so
many
of
the
village
boys
came
hurrying
to
join
it
and
to
inquire
how
it
was
that
nanny
made
out
to
throw
ned
into
green
lake
then
they
all
went
forward
to
walk
along
with
her
full
of
admiration
for
a
colt
that
knew
how
to
give
a
boy
a
ducking
she
slung
him
said
one
hove
him
clean
over
her
head
she
was
goin
a
mile
a
minute
if
i
ha
been
ned
i
ha
braced
back
and
stuck
on
then
she
ha
rolled
over
not
one
of
them
offered
to
ride
her
however
and
the
procession
reached
the
house
when
it
did
so
nanny
broke
away
from
pat
and
cantered
on
to
the
the
gate
from
that
into
the
paddock
was
shut
and
she
went
over
it
with
a
splendid
leap
to
begin
a
kind
of
dance
around
the
devon
calves
it
mighty
little
good
to
fence
in
the
like
of
her
remarked
pat
i
thinkin
i

chapter
iii
a
very
wide
lake
this
is
the
coolest
place
there
is
in
the
house
remarked
ned
as
he
looked
around
the
library
that
hot
june
afternoon
grandmother
and
the
rest
of
them
have
gone
out
to
the
sewing
society
what
a
fuss
they
made
as
if
a
bit
of
a
swim
could
hurt
me
the
shelves
and
cases
were
crowded
with
books
and
at
first
he
did
nothing
but
lie
in
a
big
wickerwork
chair
and
stare
at
them
no
he
said
aloud
i
wo
do
any
reading
not
in
such
a
sweltering
day
as
this
is
i
can
get
out
that
norway
book
though
and
look
at
the
pictures
he
pulled
it
out
and
lugged
it
to
the
table
with
a
strong
impression
upon
his
mind
that
it
was
a
book
to
be
carried
around
in
january
rather
than
in
june
it
never
will
be
a
popular
book
for
boys
he
remarked
of
it
not
for
small
boys
open
it
came
and
he
began
with
a
study
of
the
abundant
illustrations
they
were
fine
and
they
stirred
him
up
by
degrees
until
he
began
to
feel
a
growing
interest
in
the
reading
matter
scattered
along
among
them
it
was
all
in
large
type
so
that
the
pages
might
be
conquered
easily
one
after
another
before
long
he
found
himself
entirely
absorbed
in
the
narrative
of
the
old
norse
times
curious
lot
of
men
they
were
he
remarked
those
vikings
how
they
did
seem
to
enjoy
killing
their
enemies
and
cutting
each
other
heads
off
they
steal
anything
too
tell
you
what
though
if
i
been
wearing
one
o
their
coats
of
mail
when
nanny
pitched
me
into
the
lake
i
ha
gone
to
the
bottom
like
a
stone
i
wonder
if
any
of
could
swim
in
their
armour
i
do
believe
they
could
most
likely
they
took
it
off
if
they
were
going
to
be
wrecked
anywhere
a
fellow
in
a
steel
shirt
ought
to
have
some
handy
more
and
more
intense
became
his
interest
as
he
went
on
and
at
about
his
grandfather
came
in
what
ned
asked
the
old
gentleman
are
you
at
it
yet
that
all
right
but
i
ca
let
you
do
too
much
of
it
you
must
spend
all
the
time
you
can
in
the
open
air
you
may
read
this
evening
but
morning
you
must
go
fishing
you
may
take
a
book
with
you
i
take
along
this
one
then
said
ned
i
can
read
between
bites
that
what
i
do
sometimes
said
his
grandfather
i
think
it
averages
about
two
books
to
each
fish
but
a
pike
pulled
a
dictionary
overboard
for
me
once
what
did
he
want
of
a
dictionary
asked
ned
did
you
hook
him
yes
i
pulled
him
in
said
the
old
gentleman
but
the
book
went
out
of
sight
it
going
to
be
too
warm
for
trolling
for
pike
i
guess
so
said
ned
i
going
to
find
some
grasshoppers
they
the
right
bait
said
grandfather
webb
better
than
worms
the
lake
is
full
of
bullheads
so
is
the
wide
wide
world
i
been
out
there
just
now
talking
to
one
of
he
an
englishman
he
been
beating
me
out
of
ten
dollars
and
he
wo
understand
my
explanation
of
it
he
insists
on
keeping
the
ten
that
like
said
ned
i
like
to
conquer
england
uncle
jack
says
that
if
i
did
they
lock
me
up
in
the
that
what
they
do
said
his
grandfather
anybody
that
invaded
england
would
be
arrested
at
once
they
convict
him
too
and
make
him
buy
something
of
i
do
care
said
ned
i
going
there
some
day
it
about
the
greatest
country
in
the
world
i
going
to
see
london
and
the
forts
and
the
ships
the
english
soldiers
and
sailors
can
fight
like
anything
they
can
whip
anybody
but
americans
come
to
supper
commanded
his
grandfather
then
you
may
go
on
with
your
book
i
afraid
though
that
if
you
were
in
command
of
the
you
try
to
steam
her
all
over
england
across
lots
without
minding
the
fences
at
the
ned
was
compelled
to
hear
quite
a
number
of
remarks
about
swimming
in
green
lake
he
better
try
that
colt
in
a
buggy
next
time
said
emmons
she
skittish
she
likes
a
buggy
remarked
uncle
jack
pat
lent
her
to
one
of
his
best
friends
last
week
to
drive
her
a
mile
or
so
for
exercise
she
did
stop
short
of
centreville
four
corners
the
buggy
there
now
in
the
getting
mended
and
nanny
came
home
alone
quiet
as
a
lamb
i
guess
edward
may
drive
one
of
the
other
horses
said
his
grandmother
pat
pick
out
a
quiet
one
i
want
a
buggy
or
something
said
ned
if
i
was
to
take
that
big
book
of
grandfather
with
me
i
never
saw
such
pictures
though
loads
of
read
it
read
it
said
his
grandfather
when
you
get
through
with
it
you
know
you
do
now
they
let
him
alone
after
that
and
talked
of
other
affairs
he
was
quite
willing
to
keep
still
and
he
got
away
from
the
table
before
anybody
else
there
was
a
growing
fever
upon
him
to
dive
into
that
folio
and
to
find
out
how
the
story
fitted
the
pictures
no
one
happened
to
go
into
the
library
until
about
eleven
and
he
was
there
alone
then
old
emmons
herself
was
hunting
everywhere
for
a
ball
of
yarn
she
had
lost
and
she
tried
the
library
ned
was
not
reading
when
she
came
in
he
was
lying
stretched
across
the
table
sound
asleep
with
his
head
on
the
open
book
and
the
cat
curled
up
beside
it
i
had
to
shake
him
awake
she
reported
afterward
and
the
cat
followed
him
when
he
went
to
his
room
nevertheless
he
was
awake
again
not
long
after
sunrise
next
morning
and
hurried
out
on
a
bait
hunt
before
breakfast
he
had
done
well
as
to
angleworms
but
not
so
well
as
to
grasshoppers
of
these
he
had
captured
only
six
shutting
them
up
in
a
little
tin
now
then
said
his
grandfather
when
they
came
out
of
the
house
together
after
breakfast
here
your
rod
three
good
lines
plenty
of
hooks
and
sinkers
the
boat
down
there
at
the
landing
i
saw
it
when
i
swam
ashore
said
ned
it
a
and
it
much
a
it
better
than
it
looks
replied
the
old
gentleman
i
saw
four
men
in
it
once
and
they
went
across
the
lake
before
it
upset
with
them
did
any
of
get
drowned
asked
ned
no
said
webb
not
half
drowned
i
was
out
in
another
boat
with
pat
mccarty
trolling
and
we
fished
in
all
four
of
you
need
get
upset
unless
you
try
to
carry
nanny
or
some
of
the
boys
i
rather
you
not
have
any
company
safer
i
do
want
any
of
along
said
ned
i
rather
be
alone
then
i
can
read
while
i
waiting
for
fish
you
said
i
could
take
that
big
book
all
right
you
may
said
his
grandfather
put
it
into
your
be
sure
you
bring
it
home
with
you
away
went
ned
and
his
grandfather
turned
back
into
the
house
laughing
he
think
twice
he
said
before
he
lugs
that
folio
to
green
lake
this
hot
day
he
wo
take
it
he
was
only
half
right
for
ned
had
already
thought
twice
at
least
and
had
decided
what
to
do
he
had
found
a
small
lightly
made
garden
and
when
he
set
out
for
green
lake
all
his
baggage
was
in
the
cart
including
the
book
the
angleworms
and
the
grasshoppers
he
succeeded
in
getting
away
quietly
too
without
giving
pat
or
anybody
else
a
chance
to
ask
him
if
he
expected
to
need
a
wagon
to
bring
home
his
fish
it
was
getting
very
warm
before
he
was
half
a
mile
from
the
house
for
june
days
always
grow
warmer
rapidly
if
you
are
shoving
a
it
was
a
good
lift
to
get
the
book
in
thought
ned
i
wish
greased
the
wheels
the
boat
lay
idly
at
the
shore
when
he
reached
the
a
pair
of
oars
lay
in
it
but
he
saw
also
something
which
pleased
him
much
more
mast
and
sail
he
shouted
who
ha
thought
of
that
hurrah
there
they
lay
a
short
mast
truly
and
a
mere
rag
of
sail
with
a
boom
and
sprit
all
ready
for
use
i
know
how
thought
ned
i
can
step
the
mast
and
hoist
the
sail
myself
then
i
can
tack
all
over
the
lake
without
any
hard
work
his
first
undertaking
however
was
to
get
his
huge
folio
volume
into
the
boat
and
not
into
the
water
he
succeeded
perfectly
with
some
effort
then
he
stepped
his
bit
of
a
mainmast
as
he
called
it
through
the
hole
bored
for
it
in
the
forward
seat
of
the
punt
it
was
plain
that
he
knew
something
about
naval
affairs
for
he
spoke
of
his
cruiser
as
a
catboat
and
regretted
that
she
had
no
tiller
illustration
june
days
always
grow
warmer
rapidly
if
you
are
shoving
a
she
has
any
anchor
either
he
said
except
a
rope
and
a
crooked
stone
she
has
a
keel
though
and
there
are
in
her
bulwarks
starboard
and
port
she
higher
at
the
stern
than
she
is
at
the
prow
and
i
afraid
she
be
a
little
cranky
in
a
breeze
she
is
ballasted
to
speak
of
and
i
better
keep
her
well
before
the
wind
that
a
little
by
north
just
now
however
that
might
be
he
pushed
his
gallant
bark
out
from
the
shore
sitting
in
the
stern
and
shoving
the
land
away
with
the
rudder
that
is
to
say
with
one
of
the
oars
the
sail
was
already
up
but
it
was
a
question
to
be
answered
how
he
could
have
told
the
direction
from
which
the
wind
was
coming
or
where
it
was
going
to
any
ordinary
observer
not
an
old
salt
nor
the
commander
of
a
ironclad
it
looked
as
if
the
wind
had
not
yet
reached
green
lake
it
had
very
likely
paused
somewhere
in
the
village
or
over
among
the
woods
i
have
to
row
at
first
he
remarked
i
think
i
can
see
a
ripple
out
yonder
where
there
a
ripple
there
wind
or
it
may
have
been
made
by
that
pickerel
when
he
jumped
out
after
something
if
bite
i
pull
him
in
rowing
is
after
all
easy
enough
work
when
there
is
no
hurry
and
the
boat
is
nearly
empty
ned
pulled
gently
on
his
oars
and
the
boom
and
sail
swung
to
and
fro
as
she
slipped
along
pretty
soon
she
reached
and
went
through
the
ripple
made
by
the
pickerel
leaving
behind
her
others
that
were
larger
but
which
did
not
indicate
wind
i
give
something
for
a
catspaw
he
said
remembering
another
nautical
term
i
need
furl
the
mainsail
she
can
drift
to
looard
if
she
wants
to
while
i
try
for
some
fish
if
it
true
that
this
lake
has
any
bottom
it
wo
pay
to
cast
anchor
there
is
cable
enough
in
that
coil
to
do
any
good
he
ceased
rowing
he
put
his
joint
rod
together
and
fitted
on
his
reel
ready
for
sport
the
bait
question
was
decided
against
worms
and
in
favour
of
grasshoppers
with
regret
that
he
had
so
few
now
he
said
i
do
much
care
whether
it
to
be
a
bass
or
a
pickerel
no
choice
was
given
him
for
in
only
a
minute
or
so
more
a
handsome
yellow
perch
came
over
the
side
of
the
boat
to
account
for
one
grasshopper
that
fellow
weigh
a
pound
more
or
less
he
said
i
do
want
any
pumpkinseeds
though
that
however
was
the
kind
of
fish
he
pulled
in
next
shortly
afterward
he
had
the
usual
unpleasantness
belonging
to
the
unhooking
of
a
large
fat
bullhead
he
was
really
making
a
very
good
beginning
indeed
considering
what
was
the
established
reputation
of
green
lake
uncle
jack
said
it
was
fished
out
he
said
to
himself
i
guess
there
are
more
shiners
and
pumpkinseeds
than
anything
else
hullo
here
comes
a
big
one
what
seemed
to
be
a
tremendous
tug
at
his
hook
held
on
vigorously
as
he
hauled
in
his
line
the
excitement
of
that
strong
bite
made
him
tingle
all
over
pickerel
he
shouted
or
a
big
bass
or
maybe
it
a
pike
or
a
lake
trout
what
will
uncle
jack
say
now
in
a
few
moments
more
he
was
sadly
replying
on
behalf
of
his
uncle
nothing
but
a
eel
soaked
bush
branches
and
pond
weed
are
hard
to
pull
in
and
they
are
good
for
nothing
in
a
a
fisherman
gloomiest
disappointments
come
to
him
in
the
landing
of
them
another
grasshopper
was
put
on
and
another
cast
was
made
the
bullhead
flopped
discontentedly
on
the
bottom
of
the
boat
so
did
the
perch
now
and
then
but
there
were
no
other
signs
of
fish
life
during
the
next
with
the
sun
all
the
while
growing
hotter
i
stick
my
rod
thought
ned
and
throw
out
another
line
with
a
worm
then
i
read
till
i
get
a
bite
i
think
it
coming
on
to
blow
a
little
i
can
see
signs
of
weather
so
he
could
really
hardly
were
his
two
hooks
and
lines
in
the
water
before
what
some
people
romantically
term
a
zephyr
came
gently
breathing
along
the
placid
lake
it
soon
grew
even
strong
enough
to
make
itself
felt
by
the
drooping
sail
but
ned
remarked
as
he
lifted
his
eyes
from
his
book
illustrations
that
canvas
does
bend
worth
a
cent
i
need
take
in
any
reef
just
now
let
her
spin
along
hullo
the
boat
beginning
to
move
he
felt
more
and
more
sure
of
that
while
he
again
bent
over
the
folio
opened
out
upon
the
middle
seat
with
an
old
starch
box
behind
it
for
his
accommodation
the
breeze
had
come
what
there
was
of
it
but
he
shortly
forgot
all
about
winds
and
fishing
while
he
turned
page
after
page
of
that
book
and
took
in
more
and
more
of
the
meaning
of
the
pictures
the
sail
was
now
filled
well
there
were
larger
and
larger
wavelets
on
the
lake
but
there
came
no
to
interrupt
reading
he
had
no
idea
for
how
long
a
time
he
had
been
sailing
on
without
noticing
anything
whatever
around
him
at
last
however
the
wind
grew
strong
enough
to
turn
one
of
his
for
him
and
he
once
more
raised
his
head
i
declare
he
exclaimed
this
bit
of
a
gale
is
freshening
i
haul
on
the
main
sheet
and
bring
her
head
to
the
wind
she
leaning
over
a
little
too
much
if
a
gust
or
a
squall
should
come
on
she
might
turn
turtle
he
evidently
knew
what
it
was
best
to
do
under
such
circumstances
and
his
next
exclamation
was
uttered
with
even
stronger
emphasis
he
was
of
course
doing
something
in
the
steering
line
with
his
and
he
had
taken
occasion
to
look
back
along
the
wake
of
his
dashing
scow
what
this
who
ever
knew
that
green
lake
was
so
wide
i
ca
see
the
other
shore
toward
our
house
there
is
another
boat
in
sight
either
if
i
expect
to
get
home
it
about
time
i
went
about
and
headed
southerly
this
is
a
curious
piece
of
business
i
take
in
my
lines
right
away
he
shut
up
his
book
at
once
there
was
even
an
anxious
tone
in
his
voice
and
an
exceedingly
puzzled
look
upon
his
face
it
was
such
perhaps
as
the
captain
of
a
might
wear
upon
finding
his
huge
fighting
machine
in
unknown
or
difficult
navigation
any
experienced
nautical
man
would
have
been
able
to
comprehend
unpleasant
situation
that
is
perhaps
so
if
it
had
been
at
all
possible
to
know
what
was
the
precise
nature
of
the
circumstances
the
lines
came
in
fast
enough
and
ned
knew
how
to
tack
if
that
were
indeed
the
correct
thing
for
him
to
do
next
now
however
came
a
second
discovery
almost
as
perplexing
as
the
first
behind
him
was
a
wide
waste
of
water
without
a
visible
shore
but
he
was
by
no
means
out
of
sight
of
land
when
he
turned
to
look
ahead
the
northerly
shore
of
the
lake
was
near
and
it
was
rapidly
drawing
nearer
this
is
tremendous
he
remarked
and
he
took
a
tin
cup
out
of
his
expressing
a
hope
that
the
lake
water
might
not
prove
too
warm
to
drink
he
leaned
over
the
side
of
the
boat
still
gazing
shoreward
scooped
the
cup
full
and
began
to
drink
like
a
very
thirsty
fellow
faugh
phew
he
suddenly
sputtered
and
a
vigorous
choking
coughing
spell
followed
what
this
salt
water
how
did
green
lake
get
salted
he
tasted
again
as
if
to
make
sure
and
then
he
looked
around
him
utterly
bewildered
the
shore
was
all
the
while
drawing
nearer
and
the
water
in
his
cup
was
of
the
peculiar
brackish
flavour
that
belongs
to
the
great
seas
mountains
he
murmured
i
knew
there
were
high
hills
over
this
way
but
i
never
was
told
of
anything
like
this
right
along
shore
too
why
that
cliff
there
as
high
as
a
church
steeple
higher
that
an
eagle
too
circling
around
over
the
top
of
it
was
one
side
of
green
lake
salt
and
the
other
fresh
or
had
it
in
some
mysterious
way
broken
through
and
become
connected
with
the
atlantic
it
even
occurred
to
him
to
wonder
vaguely
if
the
lake
had
joined
the
ocean
in
such
a
way
that
ships
the
for
instance
could
ever
come
steaming
in
firing
salutes
and
astonishing
all
the
country
people
his
head
was
all
a
buzz
of
perplexing
questions
but
he
managed
to
keep
hold
of
his
rudder
and
speed
onward
toward
the
land
in
fact
the
wind
was
now
very
good
and
the
punt
was
running
rapidly
yonder
he
remarked
aloud
is
the
mouth
of
a
kind
of
inlet
those
cliffs
on
each
side
of
it
are
awful
they
almost
perpendicular
it
makes
a
fellow
think
of
some
of
those
pictures
of
norway
fiords
in
the
book
the
best
thing
i
can
do
is
to
steer
right
in
and
find
out
what
it
is
tell
you
what
though
i
sailed
farther
than
i
any
idea
of
he
still
had
some
distance
to
go
before
reaching
the
opening
between
the
tall
cliffs
and
his
eyes
were
busy
he
tried
the
water
yet
again
curiously
i
know
what
sea
water
is
he
thought
i
tried
it
once
out
in
new
york
bay
this
tastes
salter
than
that
did
hullo
those
are
porpoises
tumbling
around
out
yonder
i
seen
porpoises
before
off
long
island
when
i
went
bluefishing
with
uncle
jack
i
wish
he
were
here
to
tell
me
what
all
this
amounts
to
he
knows
a
heap
perfectly
stupendous
were
those
beetling
promontories
between
which
the
boat
sailed
in
they
must
have
been
several
hundreds
of
feet
in
height
here
and
there
in
the
clefts
and
crevices
of
their
rugged
sides
and
along
their
summits
grew
gigantic
pines
and
i
put
away
the
book
he
said
in
the
locker
under
the
back
seat
i
going
ashore
i
want
to
find
somebody
that
can
tell
me
what
this
means
i
wo
go
home
till
i
know
all
about
it
this
is
any
kind
of
cove
though
it
runs
away
in
so
it
did
narrow
and
deep
and
it
wound
around
a
rock
corner
shortly
so
that
all
view
of
green
lake
behind
him
was
cut
off
it
was
almost
cool
in
there
as
well
as
shadowy
and
ned
felt
a
kind
of
shudder
going
over
him
he
was
not
exactly
afraid
but
his
heart
was
beating
more
quickly
than
usual
he
had
put
away
the
folio
with
great
care
and
all
of
its
four
hundred
and
splendid
illustrations
seemed
to
be
running
through
his
memory
like
a
river
in
a
after
a
rousing
there
he
exclaimed
at
last
there
a
i
can
see
boats
and
men
and
women
away
off
yonder
up
the
slope
houses
enough
for
a
village
hullo
that
a
ship
at
anchor
beyond
the
village
as
far
as
his
eyes
could
search
were
more
mountains
covered
up
with
forests
but
right
here
before
him
the
fiord
widened
so
as
to
make
a
small
harbour
of
the
safest
kind
it
was
really
a
very
beautiful
place
to
visit
if
ned
had
been
at
all
able
just
then
to
admire
scenery
who
would
have
thought
he
exclaimed
that
a
fellow
could
get
to
such
a
thing
as
this
is
just
by
crossing
green
lake
chapter
iv
behind
the
times
i
wish
i
had
on
a
better
rig
thought
ned
very
naturally
i
look
like
anything
he
felt
that
he
was
going
in
among
entire
strangers
and
that
he
was
not
by
any
means
in
company
dress
he
had
come
out
fishing
in
a
pair
of
blue
flannel
trousers
and
a
blue
woollen
outing
shirt
with
canvas
shoes
and
wearing
the
low
brown
felt
hat
he
had
dived
in
yesterday
it
was
dry
now
but
not
handsome
he
lowered
his
sail
and
began
to
paddle
slowly
along
thinking
of
all
sorts
of
things
and
watching
sharply
for
whatever
might
turn
up
he
studied
the
sloop
at
anchor
as
he
went
past
it
and
declared
that
it
was
a
queer
enough
craft
to
look
at
it
was
very
long
and
it
was
low
amidships
with
big
along
the
rails
as
if
it
were
planned
to
operate
occasionally
as
a
rowboat
the
stern
of
it
rose
very
high
so
that
it
might
contain
a
cabin
and
so
did
the
bow
projecting
from
the
latter
was
an
beak
it
was
and
ned
remarked
that
a
ram
but
she
does
look
much
like
a
our
ironclads
have
rams
but
they
never
get
near
enough
to
other
ships
to
strike
with
them
our
fighting
has
to
be
done
with
guns
well
i
never
saw
her
like
before
hullo
i
see
it
she
is
made
like
the
norse
pirate
pictures
in
that
book
she
is
one
of
them
he
was
eager
enough
to
go
forward
now
and
he
rowed
with
his
eyes
at
work
in
all
directions
the
was
now
not
far
ahead
of
him
it
was
provided
with
a
pretty
substantial
wharf
made
of
logs
and
stones
from
this
a
pier
of
similar
construction
ran
out
about
fifty
feet
into
the
harbour
upon
the
deck
of
the
pier
and
on
the
wharf
and
along
the
beach
were
scattered
men
and
women
and
there
were
a
number
of
rowboats
hitched
here
and
there
or
pulled
up
on
the
shore
ned
ceased
rowing
for
a
full
to
stare
intensely
at
the
people
and
then
he
exclaimed
i
guess
i
right
about
it
these
chaps
are
out
and
out
norsemen
that
biggest
man
wears
an
iron
topknot
too
and
he
carries
a
spear
every
man
of
has
a
short
sword
at
his
belt
and
those
are
all
what
the
book
calls
seaxes
i
know
where
i
am
now
i
in
for
it
but
how
on
earth
am
i
ever
to
get
home
again
in
time
for
supper
that
particular
anxiety
and
almost
everything
else
was
speedily
driven
out
of
his
head
as
he
paddled
his
punt
in
among
the
at
the
pier
it
came
very
near
astonishing
him
however
that
not
a
soul
among
them
seemed
to
be
at
all
surprised
at
seeing
him
they
paid
him
no
especial
attention
after
they
had
hailed
him
and
after
he
had
replied
to
them
in
the
language
which
he
had
learned
at
home
from
old
erica
she
herself
had
told
him
that
her
speech
was
not
exactly
the
norwegian
of
the
printed
books
she
could
not
even
read
them
very
well
for
she
had
been
born
up
among
the
mountains
and
fiords
where
the
country
people
still
talked
the
ancient
norse
dialect
which
could
sometimes
hardly
be
understood
by
town
folk
that
is
he
knew
already
that
norway
in
that
particular
was
very
much
like
parts
of
england
scotland
ireland
and
several
other
countries
as
for
the
manner
in
which
he
was
received
it
was
possible
that
his
rig
which
had
made
him
nervous
was
in
his
favour
he
was
really
very
much
better
dressed
than
were
any
of
these
fisher
people
they
all
bowed
to
him
politely
and
he
heard
them
say
something
about
his
being
a
young
jarl
he
had
some
idea
of
the
meaning
of
that
term
but
he
did
not
just
now
feel
like
a
highly
aristocratic
boy
the
man
who
wore
the
steel
cap
and
carried
the
spear
was
very
busy
giving
directions
to
the
others
and
was
evidently
some
sort
of
captain
among
them
just
as
ned
stepped
from
the
pier
to
the
wharf
however
he
saw
something
that
almost
took
his
breath
away
and
he
paid
no
more
attention
to
anything
else
is
he
splendid
he
exclaimed
it
the
first
time
i
ever
saw
a
man
in
armour
not
many
paces
away
and
coming
slowly
and
with
dignity
was
a
tall
norseman
he
carried
no
shield
but
he
wore
a
coat
of
that
glittered
in
the
sunshine
the
spear
in
his
hand
was
long
with
a
straight
blade
that
was
broad
and
brightly
polished
his
helmet
was
open
in
front
and
was
ornamented
on
top
by
a
small
pair
of
gilded
wings
his
face
was
handsome
and
he
smiled
very
as
ned
stepped
forward
to
meet
him
i
am
vebba
son
of
bjorn
he
said
thou
art
welcome
who
art
thou
i
am
ned
webb
i
went
out
fishing
and
i
came
in
by
the
fiord
ned
son
of
webb
replied
the
viking
thou
art
of
the
south
haven
men
i
know
them
not
well
come
thou
to
my
house
i
will
meet
thy
father
when
he
cometh
to
the
gathering
i
shall
be
glad
to
come
said
ned
with
his
best
manners
but
he
was
thinking
meet
my
father
well
i
do
believe
he
will
i
a
pretty
clear
notion
that
father
wo
be
there
all
mine
have
been
fishing
also
said
vebba
as
he
turned
to
walk
away
ned
following
with
him
thou
must
know
that
we
are
salting
and
smoking
every
fin
we
can
pull
in
that
the
ships
of
harold
fleet
may
not
sail
without
plentiful
provisions
when
he
and
tostig
godwinson
harness
the
steeds
of
the
sea
to
bear
the
heroes
of
the
north
to
the
conquest
of
england
ned
heart
gave
a
great
thump
and
vebba
must
have
noticed
how
his
face
flushed
with
sudden
delight
for
he
laughed
loudly
and
said
to
him
thou
art
but
young
to
join
in
a
feast
of
swords
but
we
will
arm
thee
and
thou
shalt
sail
with
us
to
the
shore
of
britain
there
will
be
grand
fighting
when
we
close
with
the
saxon
host
that
will
meet
us
under
harold
the
king
that
just
what
i
like
to
see
exclaimed
ned
of
all
things
always
wanted
to
conquer
england
and
now
i
to
have
a
chance
when
do
you
all
expect
to
go
it
hath
taken
long
to
build
ships
replied
vebba
the
keels
of
hardrada
will
be
fifteen
score
and
tostig
hath
already
as
many
as
three
score
with
him
at
bruges
we
wait
now
only
for
the
outfitting
let
us
walk
on
to
the
house
ned
had
noticed
that
with
the
exception
of
vebba
all
whom
he
had
yet
seen
were
barefooted
the
chief
however
for
there
could
be
no
doubt
about
his
rank
wore
sandals
that
were
strapped
to
his
feet
and
ankles
by
broad
thongs
of
leather
most
of
the
other
men
wore
leathern
blouses
which
reminded
ned
of
some
buckskin
he
had
seen
pictures
of
the
women
were
supplied
with
gowns
some
of
which
were
of
coarse
woollen
stuff
and
some
of
leather
all
of
the
garments
were
more
or
less
and
not
a
few
were
ragged
no
style
here
thought
ned
i
wonder
though
if
a
steel
cap
feels
heavy
on
a
fellow
head
perhaps
it
does
when
one
gets
used
to
it
oh
but
i
glad
i
can
understand
them
i
be
in
the
worst
kind
of
fix
if
i
could
the
fish
which
had
been
brought
to
the
shore
in
the
boats
were
very
fine
ned
saw
cod
haddock
herring
salmon
and
some
that
he
was
not
familiar
with
heaviest
of
all
was
a
great
porpoise
they
had
speared
and
that
lay
on
the
sand
ready
for
cutting
up
for
war
purposes
he
had
never
before
heard
of
being
eaten
the
village
lay
somewhat
farther
from
the
landing
than
it
had
at
first
appeared
looking
at
it
from
the
water
it
was
in
a
narrow
valley
between
two
rugged
mountainous
ridges
and
all
around
it
were
broad
fields
of
cultivated
land
most
of
the
houses
were
and
small
constructed
of
logs
and
stones
and
tempered
clay
that
was
used
to
stop
chinks
and
holes
with
three
or
four
of
a
better
sort
were
built
in
part
at
least
of
hewn
logs
and
planks
and
pretty
but
all
were
irregular
in
plan
and
as
if
they
had
been
builded
at
random
of
these
larger
dwellings
the
roofs
were
differing
altogether
from
the
mere
cabins
ned
did
not
see
any
chimneys
and
he
knew
why
after
his
armoured
guide
had
led
him
into
the
most
extensive
house
at
the
upper
end
of
the
village
it
was
more
like
a
collection
of
houses
around
one
huge
affair
in
the
middle
and
this
when
he
entered
it
seemed
to
be
all
one
room
or
hall
hullo
thought
ned
there
their
fireplace
in
the
middle
of
the
floor
and
the
smoke
gets
out
at
that
hole
in
the
roof
if
it
can
well
no
there
is
any
floor
but
the
earth
except
at
the
end
away
there
at
the
left
there
a
pretty
wide
plank
platform
there
on
this
dais
raised
about
a
foot
above
the
hard
beaten
earth
of
the
rest
of
the
level
he
saw
a
long
table
around
which
were
benches
and
chairs
of
various
kinds
in
the
middle
behind
the
table
was
one
very
chair
of
oak
that
was
covered
with
grotesque
carving
that
the
he
said
to
himself
it
big
enough
for
a
new
york
hotel
there
are
benches
and
bunks
all
around
the
sides
of
the
room
six
windows
too
and
not
a
sash
in
one
of
them
that
good
enough
for
summer
but
what
do
they
do
in
winter
he
had
to
leave
that
question
unsettled
so
many
others
were
coming
along
the
earth
floor
seemed
to
be
as
hard
as
stone
but
it
could
not
have
been
swept
recently
there
were
neither
carpets
nor
rugs
but
in
one
corner
he
saw
a
and
what
looked
like
a
for
weaving
in
another
corner
was
a
strong
at
the
side
of
which
was
an
anvil
against
which
a
large
bellows
was
leaning
the
clothing
he
had
seen
had
told
him
that
these
people
knew
what
to
do
with
wool
and
flax
he
was
quickly
compelled
to
cut
off
his
observations
for
now
a
tall
handsome
woman
came
forward
and
shook
hands
with
him
telling
him
that
she
was
wiltna
the
wife
of
vebba
following
her
were
other
women
and
at
least
a
dozen
of
boys
and
girls
whose
several
names
he
had
a
great
deal
of
difficulty
in
catching
he
did
best
of
all
with
one
tall
youngster
of
about
his
own
age
i
am
lars
son
of
vebba
he
said
loudly
come
with
me
and
see
the
hawks
and
hounds
let
us
get
away
from
so
many
women
i
am
glad
thou
art
come
in
an
instant
ned
began
to
feel
at
home
what
would
he
have
done
in
a
country
where
there
were
no
boys
if
there
ever
was
such
a
forlorn
land
as
that
he
and
lars
were
like
old
friends
in
a
minute
but
they
had
only
to
get
out
of
the
house
to
see
some
of
the
dogs
a
pair
of
tall
came
bounding
toward
them
not
barking
but
uttering
strange
short
howls
of
greeting
and
showing
dangerous
rows
of
sharp
white
teeth
lars
wrestled
for
a
moment
with
one
of
them
boxing
the
animal
ears
fearlessly
and
ned
made
friends
with
the
other
on
they
all
went
then
to
a
low
building
behind
the
house
from
which
a
chorus
of
howls
arose
as
they
drew
near
pups
that
are
only
half
trained
said
lars
we
have
to
keep
shut
up
if
they
and
some
of
the
older
savages
got
out
we
might
never
see
again
they
go
hunting
on
their
own
account
or
they
get
among
the
sheep
then
they
be
worse
than
wolves
for
the
shepherd
dogs
would
fight
them
it
was
hardly
necessary
for
ned
to
ask
questions
so
eager
was
lars
to
entertain
him
and
to
tell
him
the
name
and
character
of
all
the
dogs
in
all
the
kennels
older
and
younger
they
went
to
the
stables
after
that
and
to
a
paddock
horses
enough
thought
ned
but
only
a
very
few
of
them
are
large
ones
nanny
could
run
out
of
sight
of
anything
i
seen
here
a
lot
and
the
carts
and
the
harness
are
all
the
roughest
kind
they
do
seem
to
know
what
a
buckle
is
and
the
wheels
are
a
sight
to
see
they
make
pretty
good
saddles
though
now
for
the
hawks
i
want
to
see
on
went
lars
to
his
beyond
the
stables
and
here
was
what
ned
called
the
biggest
kind
of
poultry
show
there
were
more
than
twenty
falcons
of
all
sorts
in
vebba
falconry
all
of
them
were
leading
dull
and
tedious
lives
sitting
on
perches
and
several
of
them
were
not
only
fettered
but
hooded
lars
transferred
one
of
these
from
its
perch
to
his
own
wrist
over
which
he
wore
a
thick
leather
guard
to
protect
the
skin
from
the
sharp
talons
of
the
bird
come
on
he
said
i
show
thee
there
wo
be
any
game
in
sight
but
i
fly
him
and
call
him
i
trained
him
myself
he
a
gerfalcon
hardrada
brother
gave
him
to
father
after
the
fight
with
the
pirates
at
croning
fiord
father
killed
five
of
them
and
took
one
of
their
boats
it
was
almost
big
enough
for
a
ship
it
got
sunk
though
last
winter
by
the
ice
so
they
chatted
back
and
forth
as
they
walked
along
together
away
out
of
the
village
they
met
people
who
bowed
and
greeted
them
but
no
other
boys
seemed
to
feel
at
liberty
to
join
them
ned
learned
afterward
that
it
was
considered
bad
manners
for
anybody
to
interfere
with
hawking
or
any
other
kind
of
sport
suddenly
lars
uttered
a
short
sharp
cry
as
he
looked
upward
and
the
falcon
began
to
ruffle
his
feathers
a
heron
exclaimed
lars
he
is
well
up
but
my
bird
can
reach
him
off
came
the
falcon
hood
and
his
brilliant
eyes
winked
rapidly
as
they
were
getting
accustomed
again
to
the
light
illustration
with
a
strong
motion
then
he
threw
his
hawk
upward
he
seeth
shouted
lars
i
cast
him
with
a
strong
motion
then
he
threw
his
hawk
upward
blowing
a
shrill
screech
upon
a
bone
whistle
that
hung
by
a
cord
of
braided
leather
around
his
neck
hurrah
exclaimed
ned
as
the
beautiful
hawk
spread
his
pinions
and
sailed
swiftly
away
he
seeth
the
heron
his
own
eyes
could
not
see
the
game
very
well
so
high
in
the
air
it
was
flying
and
the
sunlight
dazzled
him
higher
higher
in
great
circles
the
falcon
sped
upward
until
he
arose
above
the
now
frightened
and
screaming
heron
he
will
strike
soon
said
lars
see
he
is
swooping
he
never
faileth
he
is
the
king
of
gerfalcons
at
that
moment
the
falcon
seemed
to
ned
a
mere
speck
against
the
sky
while
the
heron
was
flying
lower
as
if
its
fear
bore
it
downward
then
the
speck
above
it
disappeared
for
a
moment
so
like
a
flash
of
lightning
was
the
unerring
pounce
of
the
bird
of
prey
struck
well
struck
shouted
lars
forward
now
we
must
be
with
them
at
their
falling
it
was
not
far
that
they
had
to
run
and
ned
kept
well
abreast
of
his
young
norse
comrade
he
saw
the
hawk
and
the
heron
strike
the
earth
together
fluttering
and
struggling
and
then
the
game
lay
motionless
forward
darted
lars
before
the
falcon
released
the
grip
of
his
talons
and
in
a
moment
more
the
bird
bright
eyes
were
hooded
again
he
shall
not
tear
said
lars
it
would
harm
his
training
nevertheless
his
favourite
screamed
angrily
as
he
was
restored
to
the
wrist
of
his
master
thou
knowest
said
lars
that
no
hawk
will
come
to
a
whistle
when
his
talons
are
in
it
is
only
when
they
miss
that
thou
canst
call
them
back
do
your
hawks
ever
miss
asked
ned
often
said
lars
or
else
there
were
soon
no
more
herons
all
of
these
fowl
will
fight
too
i
have
seen
an
old
heron
kill
a
falcon
spiking
him
i
read
about
it
thought
ned
and
i
glad
i
seen
it
done
it
great
now
houseward
said
lars
picking
up
the
heron
didst
thou
ever
slay
a
wild
boar
i
never
did
confessed
ned
then
i
am
ahead
of
thee
exulted
lars
it
was
but
a
week
ago
that
my
two
hounds
and
i
brought
a
fine
one
to
bay
in
the
gorge
of
the
north
mountain
thou
seest
yonder
my
father
would
have
held
me
back
had
he
been
there
but
i
went
in
alone
when
the
boar
charged
out
my
spear
went
through
his
heart
and
the
hounds
pulled
him
down
angry
was
vebba
but
he
bade
the
carles
cut
me
out
the
tusks
to
keep
for
a
prize
there
are
wolves
and
bears
in
the
forest
mountains
inquired
ned
that
there
are
and
many
replied
lars
but
who
would
go
taking
them
in
the
when
their
fur
is
short
and
thin
no
man
careth
for
a
or
a
save
in
winter
when
the
fur
is
full
upon
them
if
thou
art
here
next
winter
i
will
show
thee
sport
ye
people
of
the
lower
fiords
and
the
towns
have
small
enjoyment
i
think
save
in
going
to
sea
this
raid
on
britain
is
to
be
my
first
long
voyage
my
father
saith
that
thou
art
to
sail
with
us
i
would
miss
it
for
anything
said
ned
canst
thou
throw
a
spear
i
will
show
thee
soon
said
lars
but
i
will
not
throw
before
the
men
lest
they
say
i
am
but
young
how
art
thou
with
a
sword
try
me
exclaimed
ned
i
am
better
with
a
sword
than
with
a
spear
then
he
remarked
to
himself
i
do
believe
he
ever
had
a
better
than
i
did
see
they
were
soon
at
the
house
and
to
ned
surprise
it
was
old
vebba
himself
who
ordered
his
son
into
what
he
called
the
house
of
arms
it
was
only
a
kind
of
barn
of
split
logwork
at
the
right
of
the
central
dwelling
it
had
a
good
earthen
floor
however
and
its
walls
inside
were
hung
with
many
weapons
so
thought
ned
is
the
great
hall
in
yonder
i
going
to
take
a
good
look
at
them
by
and
by
take
this
light
shield
said
vebba
to
ned
and
this
thin
blade
it
is
heavy
enough
for
thee
thou
wilt
first
fence
with
svip
the
son
of
pend
no
shield
said
ned
a
little
proudly
putting
it
down
on
the
floor
let
him
punch
away
at
me
several
vikings
were
standing
around
watching
and
they
all
uttered
exclamations
of
surprise
but
svip
a
youth
as
tall
as
lars
stepped
promptly
forward
sword
in
hand
neither
of
them
wore
armour
but
the
shield
of
svip
was
a
pretty
heavy
weight
for
a
fencer
to
carry
unless
the
other
fencer
should
also
be
weighted
svip
was
even
irritated
by
something
in
the
confident
manner
of
ned
the
son
of
webb
and
he
attacked
vigorously
striking
and
pushing
of
course
it
was
not
intended
that
any
hurt
should
be
done
the
swords
were
blunt
on
edge
and
point
and
the
hilts
were
basketed
with
strong
steelwork
on
each
boy
head
was
also
a
thick
cap
serving
as
a
helmet
no
blow
of
those
dull
blades
could
split
such
a
cap
in
half
a
minute
there
were
loud
exclamations
of
admiration
for
at
home
had
indeed
been
a
good
one
svip
the
son
of
pend
had
no
chance
with
him
whatever
for
there
was
no
science
at
all
in
him
he
was
even
forced
across
the
room
with
several
hard
raps
upon
his
leathern
helmet
and
then
he
was
disarmed
his
sword
flying
from
his
hand
thou
art
a
young
swordsman
shouted
vebba
thou
mayest
go
with
hardrada
thy
father
will
be
proud
of
thee
thou
shalt
give
lars
his
lessons
in
thy
skill
of
fence
try
thou
a
spear
ned
looked
at
the
light
javelins
they
brought
out
and
he
did
not
wish
to
let
them
see
how
little
he
knew
of
spears
but
a
wooden
target
was
set
and
the
other
boys
made
their
casts
it
was
his
turn
and
he
could
not
back
out
he
imitated
their
manner
of
swaying
and
balancing
and
then
he
sent
his
javelin
all
an
accident
he
thought
but
i
landed
mine
between
theirs
thou
throwest
well
said
vebba
take
now
a
shield
and
let
us
see
if
thou
canst
catch
as
well
as
throw
ned
was
silent
for
at
that
moment
lars
stepped
forth
shield
on
arm
and
spear
in
hand
to
let
the
other
youngsters
throw
headless
javelins
at
him
at
ten
paces
that
the
way
they
do
it
is
it
he
said
to
himself
as
lars
caught
throw
after
throw
upon
his
shield
quite
skilfully
any
baseball
catcher
can
beat
that
i
the
best
catcher
in
our
nine
i
can
pitch
too
i
can
stop
one
of
those
things
it
was
his
turn
next
he
did
not
actually
throw
down
the
shield
this
time
but
he
held
it
close
to
him
and
parried
with
only
his
the
throws
of
lars
and
the
others
only
one
cast
went
by
his
guard
to
ring
against
the
shield
it
is
the
better
way
said
vebba
it
is
the
skill
of
old
warriors
i
can
catch
the
spears
of
battle
on
sword
or
axe
thou
wilt
need
the
less
armour
but
who
may
parry
the
swift
arrow
thou
wilt
need
good
mail
for
english
arrows
long
and
tiresome
was
the
exercise
but
it
terminated
suddenly
for
the
sound
of
a
horn
blast
came
loudly
through
the
open
door
dinner
exclaimed
lars
oh
ned
the
son
of
webb
all
we
are
ready
to
eat
i
am
ever
glad
to
hear
the
sound
of
that
crooked
horn
let
us
go
whatever
was
ned
reply
in
norwegian
his
inner
thought
was
i
as
ready
as
he
is
chapter
the
war
summons
there
thought
ned
as
he
reëntered
the
great
central
hall
of
house
one
of
those
other
buildings
that
are
stuck
on
to
this
is
their
kitchen
he
saw
several
of
the
women
coming
in
with
dishes
through
an
open
doorway
near
him
and
he
stepped
forward
for
a
look
at
the
place
from
which
they
came
he
saw
no
cooking
stove
or
range
but
there
was
a
charcoal
fire
in
the
middle
of
the
floor
around
this
were
the
cooks
with
kettles
gridirons
and
saucepans
of
entirely
familiar
shapes
there
was
no
smoke
and
instead
of
it
there
was
an
unpleasant
smell
of
burning
charcoal
he
noticed
particularly
that
some
of
the
cooking
utensils
had
a
brassy
look
and
he
soon
afterward
discovered
that
his
new
friends
knew
how
to
do
a
great
many
things
with
copper
and
bronze
as
well
as
with
iron
and
steel
almost
everybody
was
now
hastening
toward
the
on
the
dais
if
under
ordinary
circumstances
noon
might
be
the
upon
this
occasion
there
was
a
variation
not
only
the
fishermen
of
the
family
but
several
other
persons
had
but
just
arrived
and
this
late
meal
was
to
be
something
of
an
affair
sitting
down
at
the
table
appeared
to
be
a
matter
of
particular
ceremony
and
it
quickly
aided
ned
in
understanding
how
minute
and
sharp
were
the
distinctions
of
social
position
and
rank
among
the
norsemen
they
were
a
free
people
but
for
all
that
any
man
ancestry
his
wealth
and
his
achievements
in
war
had
much
to
do
with
the
esteem
in
which
he
was
held
and
the
place
he
might
sit
in
vebba
himself
was
evidently
of
high
degree
and
he
took
his
seat
in
the
middle
chair
behind
the
table
with
great
dignity
at
his
right
was
madame
vebba
as
ned
called
her
or
wiltna
and
at
his
left
was
a
short
woman
who
wore
a
gold
bracelet
and
a
high
cap
she
might
be
a
guest
of
rank
after
these
on
either
hand
were
seated
men
and
women
with
evident
precision
according
to
some
rule
lars
and
ned
and
other
youths
not
yet
considered
especially
distinguished
were
at
the
left
end
of
the
table
and
a
number
of
young
women
and
girls
were
at
the
right
end
there
were
many
servants
to
fetch
and
carry
dishes
the
plates
are
wooden
said
ned
they
wo
break
if
you
drop
some
of
the
cups
and
pitchers
are
of
wood
made
with
hoops
like
little
pails
they
make
all
sorts
of
pails
horn
cups
crockery
green
glass
why
do
they
make
window
glass
too
he
had
taken
his
seat
by
lars
and
the
first
entirely
thoughtless
thing
that
he
did
was
to
speak
to
one
of
the
men
waiters
saying
knife
and
fork
please
oh
exclaimed
lars
i
see
he
hath
no
cutter
bring
him
a
good
blade
ned
cheeks
were
blazing
he
had
almost
forgotten
that
he
was
not
at
home
there
was
not
one
solitary
fork
in
the
hall
of
vebba
the
chief
no
he
said
aloud
nor
a
napkin
nor
a
nor
a
potato
i
hear
thee
came
suddenly
in
the
deep
tones
of
vebba
thou
hast
also
been
taught
other
tongues
it
is
well
thy
father
is
wise
with
thee
when
the
priest
cometh
he
shall
talk
with
thee
in
latin
for
we
understand
him
not
very
well
that
it
thought
ned
i
spoke
in
english
what
i
do
with
latin
then
he
replied
to
vebba
i
will
be
glad
to
see
the
priest
we
like
him
well
said
wiltna
he
is
from
ireland
where
there
are
many
such
as
he
and
he
cometh
here
to
teach
against
the
old
gods
of
the
north
most
of
the
people
swear
by
wodin
and
thor
to
this
day
they
change
not
easily
ned
did
not
say
anything
aloud
about
their
being
heathen
but
he
blurted
out
in
norwegian
it
is
just
so
among
us
we
have
ever
so
many
preachers
and
most
of
the
people
do
not
go
by
what
they
say
any
too
well
vebba
nodded
as
if
that
were
understood
to
be
a
matter
of
course
everywhere
and
the
dinner
went
on
how
they
do
drink
beer
thought
ned
nothing
else
every
fellow
uses
his
own
and
his
fingers
salt
but
no
pepper
fair
butter
pretty
good
bread
this
is
goat
mutton
is
it
i
like
it
pretty
well
i
guess
there
wo
be
any
pie
fingers
were
made
before
forks
as
uncle
jack
says
nevertheless
the
table
manners
were
very
good
and
the
food
was
abundant
fish
flesh
and
fowl
the
fish
especially
were
all
that
could
be
asked
for
and
the
poultry
was
wild
game
of
several
kinds
now
and
then
a
remark
from
vebba
or
wiltna
came
to
ned
politely
but
he
was
left
to
lars
and
the
other
youngsters
most
of
the
time
it
was
manifestly
against
the
rules
of
good
norse
society
to
ask
too
many
questions
of
a
guest
strangers
were
welcome
to
come
and
go
and
would
simply
be
treated
according
to
their
degree
while
there
in
fact
much
of
the
respect
with
which
ned
was
now
regarded
by
his
new
friends
belonged
to
the
fact
that
he
had
learned
so
much
from
his
american
and
he
too
had
been
french
the
dinner
ended
for
the
aristocratic
part
of
the
household
all
of
lower
degree
getting
their
provision
afterward
or
in
other
houses
or
outer
rooms
it
could
be
seen
that
this
day
was
of
some
unusual
interest
other
men
were
arriving
one
by
one
and
they
came
in
armour
bringing
weapons
with
them
while
they
were
being
welcomed
by
their
hosts
ned
had
a
good
opportunity
for
his
proposed
examination
of
the
ornaments
of
the
walls
of
the
hall
great
antlers
fastened
here
and
there
served
as
hooks
on
which
to
hang
things
and
all
were
heavily
loaded
there
were
helmets
of
many
patterns
shields
of
all
sorts
coats
of
mail
pieces
of
armour
coats
of
thick
leather
with
or
without
plates
of
metal
before
and
behind
and
with
and
of
curious
shapes
spears
heavy
and
light
and
swords
some
of
which
seemed
as
if
they
were
made
for
giants
for
they
were
almost
as
long
as
a
man
in
one
corner
lay
several
bundles
or
sheaves
of
arrows
and
there
were
plenty
of
bows
i
do
believe
i
could
bend
some
of
those
bows
thought
ned
rather
have
a
revolver
anyhow
or
a
repeating
rifle
that
would
carry
a
mile
it
would
send
a
bullet
through
one
of
those
coats
of
mail
or
a
shield
either
he
was
called
away
from
his
tour
of
observation
by
a
sudden
sound
of
music
he
whirled
upon
his
feet
to
see
and
there
in
front
of
the
table
on
the
dais
sat
four
old
men
with
harps
which
they
were
tuning
getting
ready
to
play
at
the
same
time
the
hall
was
growing
lighter
it
had
been
somewhat
dusky
but
now
a
strong
glare
was
reddening
over
the
walls
and
the
black
rafters
of
the
roof
the
servants
had
brought
in
upright
cressets
of
that
is
at
the
top
of
the
upright
stem
of
each
of
these
tripod
cressets
was
an
iron
basket
into
which
fragments
and
knots
of
pine
and
fir
were
fed
as
they
burned
these
were
the
chandeliers
of
the
dwelling
of
vebba
and
they
answered
remarkably
well
no
candles
to
snuff
thought
ned
but
i
rather
have
electric
light
or
coal
gas
or
kerosene
hullo
they
going
to
work
at
the
forge
i
wonder
if
every
man
around
here
has
a
blacksmith
shop
in
his
own
house
probably
not
considering
how
very
costly
a
thing
an
anvil
and
a
lot
of
hammers
and
chisels
and
files
might
be
only
a
rich
chief
could
afford
such
an
affair
as
was
that
forge
in
the
house
of
vebba
there
was
a
charcoal
fire
upon
its
masonry
now
however
and
a
brawny
grimy
man
in
a
leather
coat
was
holding
a
piece
of
steel
in
it
with
tongs
while
another
man
worked
the
bellows
then
the
four
harpers
struck
up
and
at
once
the
smith
began
to
sing
out
came
his
piece
of
steel
to
the
anvil
up
went
a
hammer
in
his
strong
right
hand
and
the
thudding
blows
that
he
struck
kept
time
with
the
music
and
with
the
cadences
of
his
i
forge
a
sword
i
hammer
steel
it
shall
cleave
shields
going
through
mail
by
it
shall
men
fall
hammer
hammer
hammer
so
do
i
shape
the
steel
for
the
battle
the
smith
had
a
rich
deep
musical
voice
and
the
hall
was
filled
with
a
great
roar
of
song
when
all
the
other
voices
in
it
joined
in
the
hammer
chorus
at
the
end
of
each
stanza
somewhat
slowly
the
meaning
of
it
all
began
to
dawn
upon
the
mind
of
ned
the
son
of
webb
this
was
not
mere
not
the
manufacture
of
one
blade
more
at
this
time
it
was
part
of
the
entertainment
of
the
evening
and
there
was
an
increasing
excitement
among
the
vikings
as
the
singing
and
harping
and
hammering
went
on
it
is
grand
thought
ned
something
else
is
coming
i
know
there
is
hullo
what
that
instantly
all
the
great
chorus
died
away
and
every
face
was
turned
toward
the
open
outer
door
of
the
hall
through
this
doorway
had
come
a
fiercely
ringing
blast
of
a
powerfully
blown
and
now
striding
forward
three
paces
into
the
hall
was
a
splendidly
armoured
warrior
carrying
shield
and
ax
ho
vebba
son
of
bjorn
he
shouted
hearken
thou
and
thine
to
the
summons
of
harold
hardrada
the
king
all
is
ready
for
britain
save
this
last
of
thy
keels
let
it
follow
thee
be
thou
at
the
seaside
the
third
day
hence
and
bring
with
thee
every
sword
and
spear
of
thy
house

back
vebba
joyfully

to
thee
and
to
thy
message
from
harold
hardrada
bide
thou
with
me
this
night
o
messenger
of
the
king

i
vebba
the
chief
loudly
responded
the
warrior
at
the
door
one
horn
of
ale
i
will
drink
for
thy
welcome
then
go
i
onward
for
the
summons
is
hasty
and
the
steeds
of
the
sea
are
already
harnessed
i
am
bidden
to
say
to
thee
and
to
all
that
the
hosts
of
the
northland
and
the
lithsmen
of
tostig
godwinson
the
earl
must
be
in
england
to
claim
the
land
for
their
own
before
the
muster
of
william
of
normandy
can
cross
the
sea
to
land
in
south
britain
it
is
to
be
ours
and
not
theirs
to
cut
down
the
saxons
of
harold
the
king
hail
to
harold
hardrada
hail
to
the
winning
of
england
by
the
heroes
of
the
northland
my
message
is
done
a
huge
horn
cup
foaming
with
ale
was
brought
to
him
he
drank
it
standing
and
it
appeared
to
be
out
of
order
to
ask
him
further
questions
at
the
same
time
however
all
the
excited
warriors
present
were
loudly
repeating
to
each
other
the
substance
of
this
war
news
away
strode
the
messenger
whose
name
escaped
the
ears
of
ned
the
son
of
webb
and
as
he
departed
the
harpers
once
more
struck
up
a
roaring
the
women
were
as
excited
as
the
men
and
many
of
them
had
excellent
voices
this
is
splendid
exclaimed
ned
and
at
that
moment
a
heavy
hand
was
laid
upon
his
arm
come
thou
with
me
said
one
of
the
older
warriors
it
is
by
the
order
of
vebba
the
chief
i
will
show
thee
thy
arms
and
armour
and
then
thou
wilt
go
to
thy
rest
we
are
to
march
in
the
morning
horses
for
thee
and
me
interrupted
lars
at
the
side
of
the
old
viking
it
is
but
six
leagues
to
ride
then
we
take
ship
there
will
be
many
carts
also
all
right
exclaimed
ned
in
english
and
then
he
corrected
himself
and
replied
in
norwegian
as
he
followed
them
to
the
house
of
arms
both
of
them
carried
torches
and
when
ned
turned
at
the
doorway
to
look
back
upon
the
vikings
the
women
and
the
harpers
he
thought
he
had
never
seen
anything
else
half
so
wonderful
the
men
had
caught
weapons
and
shields
from
the
antlers
on
the
walls
and
these
as
well
as
the
anvil
and
hammer
were
now
clanging
time
to
the
music
and
its
choruses
it
was
only
a
few
steps
farther
and
then
ned
the
son
of
webb
was
feverishly
examining
his
new
metallic
clothing
the
helmet
handed
him
was
of
bronze
it
was
plainly
made
without
any
crest
like
one
which
lars
showed
him
as
his
own
and
it
had
a
in
front
as
well
as
a
back
behind
he
put
it
on
and
it
did
not
hurt
for
it
was
lined
with
padded
next
lars
held
up
before
him
to
measure
his
size
a
beautiful
coat
of
mail
not
too
heavy
and
polished
till
it
looked
like
silver
thou
and
i
must
wear
our
mail
at
once
he
said
to
get
used
to
it
even
old
fighters
need
to
harden
a
little
after
a
long
peace
put
it
on
but
first
put
on
the
leather
shirt
for
thy
blue
cloth
is
too
thin
it
would
wear
to
holes
in
no
time
said
ned
and
he
pulled
on
over
his
outing
shirt
another
of
soft
it
was
a
genuine
pleasure
then
to
find
that
his
splendid
mail
hauberk
was
a
capital
fit
and
did
not
pinch
him
at
any
part
the
belt
by
which
his
was
to
be
suspended
had
also
a
strap
to
go
over
his
right
shoulder
the
better
to
sustain
the
weight
it
had
a
very
good
buckle
too
and
he
wondered
why
they
did
not
use
better
buckles
on
their
harness
he
drew
his
sword
from
the
sheath
to
look
at
it
and
was
delighted
it
was
a
slightly
curved
short
sabre
sharp
on
one
edge
and
at
the
point
with
a
steel
that
had
no
guard
thou
knowest
how
to
use
a
sword
said
the
old
viking
pleasantly
thou
wilt
be
a
jarl
some
day
these
are
thy
spears
and
thy
shield
and
thine
ax
fight
thou
well
before
the
eyes
of
harold
hardrada
and
the
sea
kings
for
thou
and
lars
are
but
young
to
face
saxons
the
two
spears
longer
and
shorter
were
of
the
best
the
ax
was
but
was
heavy
enough
to
need
both
of
ned
hands
to
swing
it
well
the
shield
was
round
of
thick
hide
having
thongs
within
for
a
left
arm
to
pass
through
the
other
armour
consisted
of
light
steel
leg
and
arm
pieces
and
that
would
stop
a
pretty
strong
now
we
are
ready
said
lars
thou
and
i
have
nothing
to
do
with
bows
and
arrows
neither
thy
arm
nor
mine
can
bend
a
not
one
man
in
ten
can
bend
the
bow
of
vebba
the
son
of
bjorn
and
the
bow
of
hardrada
the
sea
king
is
as
a
bow
of
steel
it
sendeth
an
arrow
through
the
side
of
a
ship
i
guess
not
thought
ned
not
anyhow
if
she
were
an
american
ironclad
what
is
all
this
armour
compared
to
our
steel
plates
i
glad
i
to
have
a
horse
though
i
do
believe
nanny
would
let
me
mount
her
if
i
came
up
to
her
in
this
rig
he
was
to
take
it
all
off
now
however
and
carry
it
with
him
to
the
room
in
which
he
was
to
sleep
this
was
in
a
small
house
that
opened
at
one
corner
into
the
main
dwelling
or
hall
in
it
around
the
sides
were
four
broad
benches
upon
each
of
which
were
and
a
straw
pillow
two
of
these
were
already
occupied
by
sleepers
and
down
went
lars
upon
another
after
putting
out
his
torch
that
it
is
it
said
ned
to
himself
well
it
bed
enough
for
a
soldier
i
suppose
i
do
just
as
he
did
his
mail
and
arms
were
laid
upon
the
floor
and
his
helmet
was
placed
upon
them
tired
exceedingly
tired
he
stretched
himself
upon
his
and
the
old
viking
walked
out
carrying
his
torch
with
him
chapter
vi
the
sea
king
through
a
sashless
window
the
next
morning
light
came
into
the
room
where
ned
was
sleeping
and
woke
him
with
it
poured
in
the
dull
roar
of
the
ocean
waves
upon
the
rocky
coast
of
norway
what
that
he
exclaimed
sitting
up
and
looking
around
him
where
am
i
i
say
what
would
father
and
mother
think
of
this
well
i
begin
to
remember
it
all
now
there
lars
i
saw
his
hawks
and
the
dogs
and
all
the
rest
then
came
the
blacksmith
business
and
the
songs
and
the
harping
i
know
where
i
am
i
a
viking
and
i
heard
the
messenger
from
king
hardrada
hurrah
i
going
to
invade
england
just
the
very
thing
i
always
wanted
to
do
he
was
on
his
feet
now
picking
up
his
arms
and
armour
his
exclamations
and
the
clatter
he
was
making
aroused
the
other
sleepers
they
too
sprang
up
with
shouts
of
warlike
enthusiasm
and
began
to
talk
eagerly
about
the
mustering
of
the
army
they
helped
one
another
with
the
mail
and
the
pieces
of
armour
for
clothing
of
that
style
had
peculiar
difficulties
of
its
own
their
hero
was
hardrada
the
sea
king
and
they
had
wild
tales
to
tell
of
his
exploits
and
adventures
around
the
world
he
went
almost
to
the
edge
of
it
once
said
lars
i
like
to
go
there
myself
and
see
where
the
sky
touches
the
earth
it
as
hard
as
a
brick
and
has
in
it
but
you
ca
climb
through
he
does
know
that
the
earth
is
round
thought
ned
but
he
will
some
day
what
he
needs
is
the
primary
and
then
four
years
in
a
grammar
school
i
want
to
see
hardrada
and
then
i
like
a
good
look
at
harold
of
england
and
william
the
norman
out
they
went
to
breakfast
and
all
the
while
ned
learned
more
and
more
about
the
great
invasion
it
was
to
be
made
by
the
largest
force
that
ever
had
sailed
from
the
northland
even
knud
the
great
the
conqueror
of
england
had
never
gathered
such
a
fleet
he
was
a
dane
indeed
but
all
sorts
of
northmen
had
gone
with
him
or
he
would
have
been
beaten
by
the
saxons
there
was
no
order
at
the
except
that
of
first
come
first
served
and
nobody
lingered
long
ned
next
errand
carried
him
to
a
place
from
which
he
could
see
the
landing
and
he
watched
the
boats
that
were
busily
plying
to
and
from
the
ship
they
loading
her
as
fast
as
they
can
he
remarked
i
rather
go
by
land
there
be
enough
a
loud
summons
from
lars
interrupted
him
and
in
a
few
minutes
more
they
were
among
a
considerable
drove
of
saddled
and
bridled
horses
some
of
them
are
big
ones
he
said
but
lars
and
i
are
to
ride
ponies
vebba
himself
was
very
well
mounted
and
he
was
riding
around
in
full
armour
giving
orders
to
his
men
these
were
several
scores
in
number
and
they
were
a
crew
their
arms
and
equipments
were
of
all
sorts
for
each
man
had
suited
himself
and
nothing
like
a
uniform
was
called
for
by
the
army
regulations
most
of
them
were
tall
fellows
but
there
were
also
a
number
of
short
fighters
with
dark
skins
and
black
hair
who
almost
seemed
to
belong
to
some
other
race
who
are
those
fellows
replied
lars
when
ned
asked
about
them
why
knowest
thou
not
who
they
are
they
belong
to
the
old
race
that
was
here
when
woden
and
thor
and
our
people
came
in
here
from
the
east
they
are
all
miners
they
live
among
the
mountains
and
some
of
them
are
wizards
they
are
good
fighters
though
and
they
never
spare
an
enemy
terrible
indeed
were
their
hard
cruel
faces
one
of
them
in
particular
had
a
kind
of
fascination
for
ned
he
was
so
tremendously
and
and
seemed
so
strong
it
was
enough
to
make
one
shudder
to
look
at
him
and
see
him
move
there
could
not
have
been
an
ounce
of
fat
on
him
but
he
must
have
weighed
over
two
hundred
pounds
for
all
that
however
he
stepped
around
as
lightly
as
a
catcher
in
a
game
of
baseball
he
is
worth
a
hundred
common
men
explained
lars
he
is
sikend
the
berserker
and
no
spear
can
hit
him
he
can
catch
an
arrow
on
his
and
he
can
cleave
a
steel
helmet
as
if
it
were
made
of
pine
there
is
any
saxon
that
can
stand
before
him
ned
and
his
friends
were
quickly
mounted
and
were
riding
away
in
a
southerly
direction
vebba
remained
behind
to
bring
on
the
main
body
of
his
following
while
a
score
of
his
best
men
went
forward
with
his
son
to
him
he
said
at
parting
get
speech
with
the
king
say
to
him
that
i
and
mine
are
coming
say
that
i
have
sent
on
great
store
of
provisions
and
three
more
good
keels
wherewith
he
may
ferry
his
levies
go
everybody
seemed
in
good
spirits
but
there
was
a
kind
of
excitement
which
was
in
the
way
of
conversation
even
the
women
at
the
house
and
in
the
village
were
cheerful
i
suppose
he
thought
they
may
do
some
crying
when
the
men
go
but
lars
says
that
the
norway
women
can
fight
his
mother
killed
a
wolf
once
i
would
like
to
have
my
mother
go
out
for
would
she
run
so
would
the
girls
or
aunt
sally
oh
he
and
lars
were
now
riding
together
at
the
rear
of
their
little
company
and
just
then
he
heard
the
sound
of
galloping
hoofs
behind
him
he
turned
his
head
to
look
and
a
horseman
wearing
a
long
black
robe
and
a
peculiar
cap
reined
in
at
his
side
exclaiming
loudly
in
latin
thou
art
ned
the
son
of
webb
i
am
brian
the
missionary
from
the
clontarf
school
and
abbey
in
blessed
ireland
to
thee
ned
summoned
up
all
the
latin
he
had
ever
worked
upon
but
there
was
danger
of
its
falling
somewhat
short
he
had
begun
with
it
early
and
uncle
jack
and
his
father
had
bored
him
horribly
with
it
year
after
year
making
him
talk
it
as
well
as
read
it
he
could
therefore
really
do
something
in
this
sudden
emergency
but
he
was
willing
to
say
little
and
to
let
the
and
friendly
priest
do
most
of
the
talking
which
he
was
ready
to
do
alas
my
son
he
remarked
to
ned
these
men
of
the
north
are
no
better
than
heathen
they
are
not
at
all
civilised
christians
such
as
we
have
in
ireland
even
after
they
are
converted
they
stick
to
their
old
gods
such
as
they
are
they
are
all
murderous
pirates
anyhow
if
it
were
not
for
the
like
of
them
and
the
danes
there
would
be
peace
and
prosperity
in
ireland
all
the
while
even
the
saxons
trouble
us
less
than
do
the
danes
and
the
jutlanders
and
the
sea
kings
ned
was
entirely
able
to
ask
questions
and
he
was
likely
to
learn
a
great
deal
concerning
the
piety
and
enlightenment
of
the
land
of
patrick
the
land
of
education
from
which
more
missionaries
were
going
out
than
from
any
other
already
had
they
done
wonders
for
the
english
and
scotch
and
similar
idolaters
alfred
the
great
said
father
brian
had
welcomed
the
irish
scholars
gladly
giving
them
houses
and
lands
and
cattle
edward
the
confessor
had
also
done
well
by
them
and
the
present
king
of
england
harold
the
son
of
godwin
had
been
their
friend
when
as
yet
he
was
only
an
earl
what
if
hardrada
and
tostig
are
going
to
beat
him
asked
ned
that
is
yet
to
be
determined
replied
father
brian
thoughtfully
they
may
indeed
divide
the
island
of
great
britain
with
duke
william
of
normandy
he
is
a
pious
man
he
speaketh
latin
he
will
bring
with
him
shiploads
of
teachers
and
missionaries
he
will
build
churches
and
found
schools
as
he
hath
already
done
in
normandy
it
hath
been
on
my
mind
that
these
vikings
may
but
cripple
the
saxons
and
open
the
way
for
william
the
norman
king
harold
of
england
is
said
to
be
a
hard
fighter
suggested
ned
thou
art
but
a
boy
exclaimed
father
brian
i
was
a
soldier
once
myself
mark
thou
harold
fighteth
with
two
at
a
time
instead
of
with
one
enemy
only
and
each
of
the
twain
is
his
equal
i
think
i
hear
that
the
english
themselves
are
little
more
than
for
harold
were
there
not
seven
kingdoms
of
them
not
so
long
ago
they
are
a
bundle
of
sticks
that
is
badly
tied
together
somehow
or
other
although
ned
was
now
one
of
hardrada
warriors
he
felt
a
strong
feeling
of
admiration
if
not
of
sympathy
growing
in
him
for
harold
of
england
the
saxon
king
was
to
be
forced
to
defend
the
northern
and
southern
ends
of
his
kingdom
at
the
same
time
and
there
was
no
fairness
in
it
a
great
deal
that
he
was
hearing
was
new
to
him
but
he
could
dimly
remember
having
read
something
somewhere
concerning
the
great
development
of
the
early
irish
church
patrick
himself
set
it
going
he
said
thoughtfully
but
father
brian
does
seem
to
know
much
about
him
perhaps
his
biography
has
been
published
there
yet
as
soon
as
it
is
he
better
get
a
copy
and
read
it
something
like
that
idea
was
wandering
around
in
his
mind
when
he
spoke
to
father
brian
in
modern
english
concerning
the
telegraphic
reports
of
harold
hardrada
landing
in
england
what
that
thou
art
saying
my
boy
sharply
inquired
the
missionary
in
good
clontarf
latin
change
thy
tongue
ned
strove
to
explain
the
matter
but
he
found
himself
altogether
at
sea
for
his
reverend
friend
had
not
the
smallest
idea
concerning
either
printing
or
electricity
it
the
lightning
is
it
he
gruffly
remarked
let
me
tell
thee
then
thou
wilt
get
little
good
out
of
that
ned
was
silenced
completely
and
gave
the
matter
up
it
a
curious
piece
of
business
he
thought
i
have
been
living
in
another
world
than
his
the
world
that
he
and
all
these
others
live
in
is
pretty
near
a
thousand
years
behind
time
i
wish
i
could
give
them
a
photograph
of
the
or
show
them
an
express
train
going
sixty
miles
an
hour
he
and
the
vikings
were
going
along
at
pony
trot
and
he
was
discovering
that
a
steel
mail
overcoat
put
on
over
leather
and
flannel
was
a
pretty
warm
kind
of
summer
clothing
i
wonder
if
a
fellow
ever
gets
used
to
it
he
remarked
to
father
brian
those
vikings
do
seem
to
mind
it
much
they
all
too
like
so
many
there
was
never
mail
made
yet
replied
the
good
man
but
something
would
go
through
it
i
split
a
shield
with
a
he
was
looking
somewhat
unpeaceful
just
then
for
his
pony
was
kicking
even
a
berserker
though
said
ned
would
want
no
bearskin
shirt
they
never
wear
them
said
the
missionary
thou
art
all
wrong
with
the
name
the
word
ber
meaneth
bear
that
so
but
some
weak
minds
will
spell
it
as
if
they
fight
in
their
linen
if
they
had
any
no
more
do
they
take
bearskins
for
mail
what
do
they
then
asked
ned
in
latin
like
other
men
said
the
priest
hotly
the
meaning
is
that
descended
from
bears
and
fight
like
wild
beasts
there
are
other
opinions
indeed
but
mine
is
as
good
as
any
other
man
any
day
perhaps
that
was
a
good
enough
reason
for
sticking
to
his
own
notions
and
lashing
his
pony
into
good
behaviour
at
all
events
ned
did
not
contradict
him
he
was
just
then
recalling
the
savage
countenance
of
sikend
the
berserker
and
it
had
reminded
him
of
a
grizzly
bear
he
had
seen
in
the
central
park
menagerie
it
the
same
expression
in
the
eyes
he
said
to
himself
but
the
old
grizzly
had
a
look
than
sikend
has
on
went
the
cavalcade
halting
at
noon
for
a
rest
and
for
luncheon
only
an
hour
or
so
after
that
they
halted
again
on
the
crest
of
a
ridge
beyond
this
lay
a
wide
deep
valley
bordered
westerly
by
the
blue
waters
of
the
north
sea
with
one
accord
the
vikings
raised
an
enthusiastic
shout
and
clashed
their
spears
against
their
shields
the
host
of
hardrada
the
sea
king
the
hundred
keels
of
norway
the
flag
of
the
world
waster
hail
to
the
banner
of
woden
hail
to
harold
hardrada
the
spears
will
be
many
and
sharp
swords
will
cleave
helms
axes
will
break
the
mail
of
the
saxons
the
of
the
men
of
vebba
young
and
old
were
fierce
and
exulting
as
they
gazed
down
upon
the
valley
and
out
upon
the
sea
scattered
upon
all
the
slopes
and
levels
and
along
the
shore
were
the
houses
of
a
considerable
town
at
the
upper
end
of
the
valley
and
also
at
the
right
of
the
very
commodious
harbour
were
what
looked
like
extensive
fortifications
these
were
composed
mainly
of
strong
palisade
works
surrounded
by
ditches
or
moats
nowhere
was
to
be
seen
anything
like
a
castle
of
stone
in
the
open
spaces
everywhere
were
tents
and
booths
these
must
now
have
been
empty
for
the
afternoon
sun
glittered
upon
the
polished
arms
and
armour
of
long
lines
and
serried
columns
of
warriors
drawn
up
in
battle
array
as
if
for
inspection
ships
ships
ships
exclaimed
ned
scores
and
scores
of
them
big
and
little
i
do
see
any
ships
with
yards
and
topsails
but
a
good
many
of
them
have
two
masts
and
some
have
three
or
four
they
are
all
single
sticks
without
topmasts
and
with
brig
and
schooner
rigging
i
shall
know
better
what
they
are
like
after
i
get
down
among
them
now
came
up
from
the
valley
a
loud
sound
of
harping
and
the
braying
of
thousands
of
followed
by
a
great
shout
that
ran
along
the
lines
as
one
body
of
troops
after
another
caught
its
meaning
and
passed
it
on
on
men
ride
forward
lars
son
of
vebba
yonder
cometh
king
hardrada
he
revieweth
his
army
before
it
goeth
on
thou
wilt
hasten
to
deliver
to
him
the
greeting
of
thy
father
let
ned
the
son
of
webb
ride
with
thee
i
go
to
the
shore
speedily
to
seek
our
shipping
this
errand
is
thine
so
spoke
the
veteran
warrior
in
charge
of
this
party
of
vebba
men
and
all
rode
rapidly
onward
this
is
awful
thought
ned
i
hope
the
king
will
have
little
to
say
to
me
i
would
know
what
on
earth
is
the
correct
way
of
talking
back
to
him
he
did
not
have
many
minutes
more
of
riding
nevertheless
before
lars
the
son
of
vebba
said
to
him
pull
in
ned
we
will
halt
at
the
right
front
of
this
nearest
square
of
men
and
wait
for
the
king
see
thou
he
and
his
jarls
and
captains
come
this
way
i
am
not
of
full
age
that
i
may
ride
to
meet
him
only
a
man
of
rank
or
a
warrior
of
fame
it
appeared
might
presume
to
go
out
in
front
of
the
lines
to
greet
the
royal
company
and
ned
began
at
once
to
breathe
more
freely
i
will
keep
a
little
back
he
said
to
father
brian
we
will
let
lars
do
the
talking
that
will
not
i
exclaimed
the
irishman
any
king
like
him
is
no
better
than
the
rest
of
us
besides
that
i
am
a
missionary
from
clontarf
i
will
speak
my
mind
to
him
he
consented
however
to
halt
with
the
rest
and
wait
for
the
king
to
come
loud
rang
the
cheers
and
fiercely
brayed
the
as
the
great
sea
king
rode
slowly
nearer
his
keen
flashing
blue
eyes
were
searching
the
array
of
his
warriors
man
by
man
and
rank
by
rank
while
his
proud
face
flushed
with
exultation
never
before
had
any
monarch
of
the
north
gathered
such
a
mustering
of
the
best
fighting
men
of
the
broad
flat
earth
hardrada
was
almost
a
giant
in
size
being
said
to
measure
over
seven
feet
and
to
be
strong
in
proportion
his
armour
was
richly
ornamented
with
gold
and
jewels
his
gilded
had
no
visor
in
front
to
hide
his
features
and
his
abundant
bright
red
hair
from
which
he
took
his
name
flowed
down
his
shoulders
in
a
mass
of
ripples
instead
of
being
worn
in
braids
like
those
of
numbers
of
his
followers
at
his
was
slung
a
huge
which
few
arms
but
his
could
wield
from
his
belt
hung
a
long
straight
sword
in
a
jewelled
sheath
his
broad
round
gorgeously
decorated
shield
was
thrown
over
his
shoulder
in
his
hand
was
a
long
spear
not
unlike
the
lances
which
were
carried
by
the
of
france
and
normandy
is
he
magnificent
exclaimed
ned
hurrah
i
have
seen
the
greatest
of
the
vikings
lars
the
saxons
will
find
him
a
hard
man
to
meet
who
is
that
other
man
at
his
side
he
is
almost
as
splendid
as
the
king
that
must
be
tostig
the
earl
said
lars
they
said
he
was
away
with
his
ships
but
he
hath
come
to
talk
with
hardrada
he
is
a
brother
of
harold
godwinson
the
king
of
the
saxons
men
say
he
is
a
good
fighter
but
not
so
good
as
his
brother
what
a
match
it
would
be
between
the
two
harolds
of
norway
and
england
that
so
said
ned
or
between
tostig
the
earl
and
sikend
the
berserker
no
man
on
earth
is
a
match
for
sikend
said
lars
he
beareth
a
charmed
life
there
are
witches
and
wizards
among
his
people
they
read
the
old
runes
on
the
tombstones
they
boil
snakes
and
lizards
and
evil
roots
to
make
charms
with
and
salve
ointments
for
hurts
some
of
them
can
make
a
close
up
and
heal
over
but
i
think
i
would
not
be
smeared
with
any
witch
grease
salve
is
a
good
thing
for
a
cut
said
ned
it
good
for
a
burn
too
you
can
find
out
the
right
thing
from
the
advertisements
i
remember
any
liniment
though
that
they
said
was
made
of
they
could
get
snakes
enough
i
guess
unless
they
raised
them
themselves
the
reviewing
party
of
great
men
headed
by
the
king
and
the
earl
halted
as
it
reached
the
head
of
the
column
with
which
vebba
men
were
posted
its
captain
had
not
yet
left
it
and
the
king
may
have
known
him
by
sight
for
he
at
once
beckoned
him
forward
with
him
rode
out
lars
father
brian
and
by
their
direction
ned
the
son
of
webb
speak
said
hardrada
to
the
warrior
what
word
hast
thou
for
me
it
is
not
mine
he
replied
o
king
lars
the
son
of
vebba
will
deliver
unto
thee
the
greeting
from
his
father
let
it
be
brief
said
the
king
time
passeth
o
harold
the
king
spoke
lars
freely
and
boldly
my
father
bade
me
greet
thee
with
this
that
all
swordsmen
are
ready
they
march
this
day
to
join
thee
the
last
of
the
provision
ships
lifteth
her
anchor
at
sunset
he
himself
cometh
with
the
miners
and
the
mountain
men
it
is
well
said
hardrada
i
know
the
value
of
thy
father
who
is
the
youth
with
thee
o
priest
hold
thou
thy
peace
that
will
i
not
responded
father
brian
sturdily
i
have
first
this
word
for
thee
that
came
by
sea
haste
thou
and
thine
or
william
the
norman
will
reach
england
before
thee
this
do
i
speak
for
thy
good
if
thou
art
able
to
take
friendly
advice
like
a
man
of
sense
thou
art
late
with
thy
warning
grimly
responded
the
king
well
did
i
know
that
matter
already
nevertheless
i
will
freely
hear
it
from
thee
thou
hast
spoken
loyally
and
now
i
would
know
concerning
the
youth
that
is
with
the
son
of
vebba
it
had
come
to
pass
by
the
way
as
they
rode
hitherward
that
ned
the
son
of
webb
had
given
to
the
missionary
the
latin
charter
name
of
the
american
city
that
he
came
from
and
from
it
a
somewhat
crooked
understanding
had
arisen
for
eboricum
is
nothing
but
york
whether
new
or
old
therefore
his
reverend
friend
at
once
replied
for
him
he
is
ned
the
son
of
webb
the
chief
or
it
might
be
he
is
somewhat
of
a
jarl
he
is
an
angle
and
he
cometh
from
york
and
a
fine
boy
he
is
if
i
say
it
myself
the
next
remark
came
promptly
from
tostig
the
earl
o
harold
the
king
my
friend
did
i
not
tell
thee
of
my
many
faithful
adherents
in
my
earldom
of
northumberland
and
in
mine
own
city
of
york
he
is
welcome
he
shall
sail
with
us
and
we
shall
be
joined
by
many
more
as
soon
as
our
standards
are
seen
at
the
humber
i
pray
thee
for
the
present
let
him
remain
with
vebba
his
friend
it
is
well
said
the
king
what
sayest
thou
ned
the
son
of
webb
o
king
said
ned
hoping
that
he
was
bowing
correctly
although
he
nearly
pitched
out
of
the
saddle
in
doing
it
i
will
do
as
tostig
the
earl
hath
said
lars
and
i
are
chums
i
would
give
much
to
see
sikend
the
berserker
in
a
battle
i
would
like
to
see
thee
fight
also
o
king
hardrada
or
tostig
the
earl
loudly
laughed
the
king
and
as
loudly
roared
tostig
and
other
of
the
great
warriors
well
spoken
shouted
hardrada
thou
shalt
have
thy
will
in
that
matter
o
hardrada
the
king
interposed
vebba
captain
i
will
say
this
for
him
that
he
is
the
best
sword
for
his
age
that
i
ever
saw
and
he
catcheth
a
flying
spear
like
an
old
fighter
i
like
him
well
said
tostig
so
let
him
show
the
northmen
of
what
sort
are
my
men
of
northumberland
it
is
a
good
thing
that
he
hath
done
to
even
flee
from
york
to
join
us
as
we
sail
no
more
was
said
and
the
royal
party
rode
slowly
on
along
the
lines
i
out
of
that
scrape
said
ned
to
himself
as
he
and
his
friends
wheeled
back
to
their
post
at
the
head
of
the
viking
column
but
what
explanation
can
i
give
if
we
ever
get
to
old
york
it
beats
me
all
hollow
at
that
moment
the
old
viking
at
his
side
said
to
him
i
go
now
to
the
shore
thou
hast
a
strong
friend
in
tostig
the
earl
i
am
glad
to
know
this
much
more
concerning
thee
and
thine
we
were
questioning
much
in
our
minds
as
to
how
we
might
deal
with
thee
and
some
said
it
were
well
to
take
off
thy
head
it
is
ever
wise
to
make
sure
of
all
comrades
who
march
with
us
for
at
times
there
have
been
false
companions
ned
was
silent
for
he
was
not
pleased
with
the
suggestion
concerning
his
head
and
the
warrior
rode
away
a
few
hours
later
vebba
arrived
with
another
force
of
his
men
and
he
expressed
great
gratification
upon
learning
that
he
would
now
be
under
no
necessity
for
giving
an
account
of
his
young
friend
aha
he
exclaimed
the
youth
appertaineth
to
tostig
the
earl
and
he
biddeth
him
to
remain
with
me
he
is
the
son
of
a
saxon
i
am
glad
to
be
upon
better
terms
with
tostig
therefore
it
was
duly
settled
in
the
minds
of
all
men
and
ned
was
acknowledged
as
being
the
right
sort
of
youth
to
associate
with
vikings
of
good
degree
the
review
having
been
finished
the
army
had
scattered
to
its
camps
vebba
men
had
been
assigned
an
open
space
a
little
north
of
the
town
and
to
this
his
first
detachment
had
marched
their
first
duty
was
to
prepare
all
things
for
further
arrivals
and
this
work
began
of
course
with
the
kindling
of
fuel
enough
had
been
provided
and
ned
at
once
discovered
something
that
was
new
to
him
the
making
of
a
fire
was
an
affair
of
toil
and
trouble
he
saw
his
comrades
carefully
splitting
splinters
and
hunting
for
handfuls
of
dry
grass
that
all
right
he
thought
but
just
look
at
that
fellow
hammering
out
sparks
with
his
flint
and
steel
it
take
him
all
night
why
does
he
go
for
an
old
newspaper
and
some
matches
the
mailed
stoker
did
nothing
of
the
kind
and
his
sparks
fell
vainly
upon
his
insufficient
tinder
that
it
exclaimed
ned
what
a
stupid
i
am
there
is
a
box
of
matches
in
all
the
world
i
guess
i
show
them
a
point
they
know
i
a
whole
box
of
lighters
in
my
now
i
wo
let
one
of
them
see
just
what
i
am
doing
it
a
good
joke
the
fire
maker
was
getting
disgusted
with
his
bad
success
and
he
was
standing
erect
at
the
moment
when
ned
stooped
and
put
something
into
the
little
heap
of
pine
splinters
nobody
had
seen
him
scratch
his
match
upon
a
stone
and
in
a
moment
more
all
eyes
turned
curiously
to
stare
at
the
sudden
blaze
which
sprang
up
so
brightly
as
the
resinous
fuel
kindled
it
is
the
work
of
the
young
saxon
of
tostig
the
earl
one
of
them
said
ay
remarked
another
he
hath
rare
skill
with
a
flint
who
ever
saw
such
fire
making
he
hath
been
well
taught
he
was
thenceforth
to
be
admired
and
valued
for
one
who
could
kindle
readily
was
a
welcome
comrade
in
a
campaign
ned
also
learned
from
their
talk
that
in
a
norway
dwelling
great
care
was
always
taken
to
keep
fire
from
day
to
day
the
whole
year
round
if
the
fire
of
one
household
should
at
any
time
be
extinguished
it
was
better
to
send
elsewhere
and
bring
to
it
a
torch
from
even
a
considerable
distance
than
to
toil
over
the
creation
of
a
brand
new
blaze
with
flint
and
steel
it
only
cost
me
one
match
thought
ned
i
be
stingy
about
burning
the
rest
they
may
last
me
clean
through
the
conquest
of
england
if
i
careful
old
newspapers
are
the
right
thing
to
start
fires
with
though
and
i
ca
even
get
an
old
to
tear
up
tents
there
were
none
for
vebba
men
but
the
night
was
clear
and
warm
and
the
supposed
favourite
of
tostig
the
great
earl
slept
like
a
top
in
his
first
bivouac
as
a
soldier
in
the
army
of
hardrada
the
sea
king
chapter
vii
the
keels
of
the
northland
how
we
shall
be
crowded
exclaimed
ned
the
son
of
webb
who
ever
supposed
that
the
vikings
had
ships
that
would
carry
so
many
passengers
some
of
them
too
are
loaded
with
horses
it
was
about
noon
of
the
day
after
the
great
review
of
army
and
ned
was
standing
upon
the
high
prow
of
the
the
which
was
to
transport
vebba
men
and
others
to
the
coast
of
england
he
knew
that
tostig
the
earl
had
hurried
away
in
a
swift
vessel
the
previous
evening
to
rejoin
his
own
squadron
at
bruges
and
he
remarked
i
glad
he
went
i
could
guess
what
to
say
if
he
were
to
corner
me
and
ask
questions
everything
here
was
going
forward
in
good
order
for
hardrada
was
an
experienced
seaman
and
so
were
his
officers
they
knew
thoroughly
well
how
to
manage
an
embarkation
of
troops
and
therefore
there
was
no
confusion
the
gathered
warriors
marched
to
the
shore
and
were
embarked
rapidly
thousand
after
thousand
it
might
be
an
exaggeration
but
ned
had
obtained
an
idea
that
the
three
hundred
ships
of
the
king
sailing
from
this
and
other
ports
when
joined
by
those
of
tostig
would
be
carrying
over
thirty
thousand
men
it
was
also
expected
that
upon
landing
they
would
be
reinforced
by
as
many
more
of
the
disaffected
saxons
who
were
ready
to
rebel
against
the
hard
rule
of
harold
the
son
of
godwin
who
was
not
descended
from
the
english
royal
line
he
is
all
the
better
for
that
thought
ned
i
like
him
he
was
elected
like
one
of
our
presidents
they
swore
him
in
too
he
had
to
confess
nevertheless
that
the
appearance
of
things
was
bad
for
the
english
king
or
president
harold
was
to
be
indeed
the
last
ruler
of
england
chosen
by
regular
election
like
an
american
all
of
the
ships
were
regarded
as
and
none
of
them
had
been
constructed
for
ease
elegance
or
the
passenger
business
each
of
them
had
more
or
less
cabin
room
for
men
of
high
degree
and
importance
but
the
rank
and
file
as
ned
called
them
would
obviously
have
to
camp
out
wherever
they
might
find
deck
room
to
lie
down
on
it
was
quite
a
comfort
to
ned
to
find
that
lars
and
he
were
to
have
bunks
under
the
after
deck
it
will
be
a
good
deal
better
he
said
if
there
should
come
a
rainy
night
the
weather
now
was
pleasant
and
ship
after
ship
was
made
ready
and
sailed
away
all
the
while
the
blowing
of
horns
and
the
shouting
were
tremendous
and
every
harper
in
the
fleet
seemed
to
be
twanging
the
best
he
knew
how
there
were
many
flags
and
streamers
and
ned
saw
several
banners
which
bore
the
black
picture
of
a
raven
he
was
staring
around
him
in
all
directions
and
the
was
swiftly
gliding
out
of
the
harbour
when
a
hearty
voice
at
his
side
declared
my
boy
i
am
glad
to
be
with
thee
on
the
same
ship
i
tell
thee
one
thing
we
are
on
a
doubtful
errand
whichever
side
wins
i
am
intending
to
stay
in
england
there
are
plenty
of
heathen
there
to
convert
and
i
not
be
in
norway
another
winter
it
a
cold
place
in
snow
time
even
the
sea
freezes
hard
and
the
wolves
come
howling
into
the
towns
at
night
and
a
man
nose
getteth
if
he
weareth
it
they
have
fine
winters
often
in
england
they
are
not
so
long
either
said
ned
i
rather
be
there
myself
how
many
days
dost
thou
give
for
this
voyage
of
ours
that
dependeth
upon
the
wind
said
father
brian
and
how
much
will
come
i
do
know
these
heathen
pirates
have
been
praying
for
good
blasts
to
all
the
old
idols
they
can
think
of
they
do
seem
to
know
the
name
of
one
saint
among
them
it
not
so
in
ireland
i
am
glad
i
was
born
in
a
civilised
land
among
christians
i
am
told
that
duke
william
of
normandy
can
speak
latin
he
is
an
exceedingly
religious
man
he
is
in
favour
of
teaching
too
but
not
one
man
in
a
thousand
of
his
own
army
can
read
the
best
parchment
i
can
put
before
him
ned
had
already
begun
to
find
his
latin
speech
improving
with
the
constant
exercise
of
it
forced
upon
him
by
father
brian
day
by
day
also
he
could
make
better
use
of
erica
norwegian
for
he
was
continually
picking
up
new
words
nevertheless
he
was
all
the
while
wondering
what
he
was
to
do
among
saxons
to
keep
up
the
impression
that
he
was
one
of
them
it
was
almost
a
relief
therefore
when
shortly
the
zealous
missionary
began
to
grumble
concerning
the
babel
of
tongues
and
dialects
in
the
british
islands
it
is
all
sorts
he
said
where
we
are
to
land
they
are
mostly
angles
and
danes
and
one
kind
of
saxons
besides
them
there
are
jutes
frisians
west
saxons
south
saxons
east
saxons
scot
saxons
and
no
man
knoweth
what
else
not
to
speak
of
the
gaels
and
the
welsh
and
the
cornishmen
it
is
not
at
all
the
same
in
ireland
my
boy
where
all
speak
the
same
tongue
except
at
the
north
of
it
and
at
the
south
and
in
the
middle
i
can
do
nothing
with
a
briton
or
a
gael
or
a
manxman
or
with
one
of
those
kernes
from
the
west
and
the
centre
that
speak
no
tongue
at
all
but
a
kind
of
jabber
that
everybody
else
hath
forgotten
long
ago
from
his
further
account
it
appeared
that
all
the
countries
and
islands
of
those
regions
were
divided
among
many
tribes
clans
and
languages
each
leading
language
was
split
up
into
local
dialects
which
differed
much
in
the
speaking
that
it
thought
ned
i
can
get
along
well
enough
where
it
an
matter
for
one
fellow
not
to
understand
another
of
the
same
kind
they
pay
it
no
attention
that
night
was
a
warm
one
and
the
fleet
sailed
along
comfortably
before
a
fair
wind
so
it
did
during
the
next
day
and
the
next
the
swarm
of
keels
kept
pretty
well
together
and
ned
the
son
of
webb
of
york
in
northumberland
the
young
friend
of
tostig
the
earl
wondered
more
and
more
at
the
size
the
swiftness
and
the
good
handling
of
those
strangely
modelled
sailing
down
the
north
sea
appeared
thus
far
as
a
very
agreeable
summer
excursion
except
for
the
crowded
condition
of
the
that
however
was
only
a
temporary
inconvenience
which
everybody
had
calculated
upon
beforehand
and
the
men
endured
it
with
general
good
humour
altogether
different
became
the
tone
of
public
feeling
so
to
call
it
when
a
gale
swept
down
from
the
north
lashing
the
sea
into
foaming
surges
the
ships
of
the
vikings
were
constructed
to
stand
against
stormy
weather
but
all
the
sails
had
to
be
taken
in
then
for
the
first
time
ned
the
son
of
webb
began
to
appreciate
the
and
the
great
oars
to
each
of
the
latter
two
or
even
three
strong
men
were
ordered
on
the
high
deck
at
the
stern
stood
an
officer
shouting
loudly
in
a
hoarse
cadence
like
a
song
and
stamping
time
with
his
feet
that
all
the
rowers
might
pull
together
at
regular
intervals
the
oarsmen
were
changed
so
that
all
on
board
except
men
of
high
rank
might
take
turns
at
this
hard
and
disagreeable
work
even
such
celebrated
warriors
as
sikend
the
berserker
were
called
upon
to
do
their
share
ned
himself
was
half
afraid
that
he
might
be
given
an
oar
and
he
may
have
escaped
quite
as
much
on
account
of
his
age
and
size
as
by
reason
of
his
supposed
aristocracy
harder
and
harder
blew
the
wind
as
the
sun
went
down
and
the
most
important
consolation
was
that
it
was
all
the
while
driving
them
toward
england
the
night
which
followed
was
full
of
discomfort
in
the
morning
the
and
weary
vikings
were
grumbling
all
over
the
ship
it
was
as
if
king
harold
hardrada
and
tostig
the
earl
were
to
be
held
responsible
for
not
having
provided
better
weather
and
smoother
water
a
fine
lot
of
men
they
are
scornfully
remarked
father
brian
look
at
them
who
would
have
expected
to
see
so
many
of
them
seasick
at
once
i
was
never
like
that
any
time
an
hour
or
so
later
ned
saw
his
reverence
leaning
dolefully
over
a
bulwark
between
two
dripping
with
all
the
roses
gone
from
his
cheeks
oh
he
exclaimed
what
did
i
eat
it
not
the
motion
of
the
ship
i
care
for
she
a
bad
one
to
pitch
and
roll
anyhow
they
build
better
ships
than
this
in
ireland
the
great
fleet
had
been
increased
from
day
to
day
as
it
was
joined
by
squadrons
from
other
ports
it
was
necessarily
scattered
far
and
wide
by
this
rough
weather
when
at
last
land
was
seen
to
the
westward
word
was
passed
rapidly
around
by
swift
rowboats
that
all
should
draw
well
together
and
make
for
the
wide
bay
known
as
the
humber
for
there
the
landing
was
to
be
made
all
disaffection
among
the
overcrowded
vikings
instantly
disappeared
as
the
good
news
spread
among
them
and
there
was
an
immediate
cleaning
of
all
weapons
and
armour
ned
himself
felt
better
for
several
reasons
i
not
been
so
very
seasick
he
said
to
himself
but
i
like
to
eat
something
cooked
i
tired
of
chewing
dried
fish
and
raw
ham
the
water
is
bad
too
and
i
wo
drink
any
beer
there
one
thing
though
there
is
any
smoking
or
tobacco
chewing
among
these
fellows
there
is
a
pipe
nor
a
cigar
nor
a
virginia
plug
in
the
whole
fleet
no
cigarettes
they
ca
get
any
yet
but
they
will
some
day
the
headlands
at
the
mouth
of
the
humber
were
very
near
now
the
king
of
england
had
no
forts
there
nor
had
he
stationed
any
forces
to
oppose
the
landing
of
an
enemy
the
fact
was
as
ned
had
learned
from
father
brian
that
the
saxons
did
very
little
building
whether
of
castles
or
churches
that
one
thing
they
have
to
learn
after
they
conquered
said
the
good
missionary
the
ignorant
savages
but
it
be
a
queer
lot
of
teaching
that
be
going
on
among
them
now
with
tostig
and
hardrada
for
teachers
ned
was
all
the
more
of
that
opinion
after
he
heard
sikend
the
berserker
blessing
thor
and
woden
for
getting
him
across
the
sea
and
for
the
chances
he
was
soon
to
have
for
murdering
saxons
i
know
what
he
means
by
the
valkyrias
and
the
ravens
said
ned
to
father
brian
but
what
is
it
he
was
saying
about
being
afraid
of
a
cow
death
these
norse
heathen
replied
the
priest
have
a
notion
that
it
a
burning
shame
for
any
man
to
die
decently
in
his
bed
he
rather
be
murdered
any
day
may
he
have
his
own
will
in
that
matter
say
i
most
likely
he
will
not
be
disappointed
this
trip
and
there
will
be
more
than
one
funeral
the
day
they
put
him
under
the
wild
beast
at
that
moment
truly
sikend
was
hardly
looking
like
a
human
being
he
sat
upon
the
low
deck
amidships
between
the
rows
of
rowers
sharpening
with
a
stone
the
edge
of
an
enormous
now
and
then
he
would
hold
it
up
to
the
light
twirling
its
heavy
weight
as
if
it
had
been
a
feather
while
his
dark
hairy
features
twisted
and
gleamed
with
bloodthirsty
ferocity
and
his
deeply
sunken
eyes
flashed
fire
from
such
a
slayer
as
he
no
foeman
might
look
for
mercy
it
was
said
of
all
berserkers
that
in
their
blind
rage
they
spared
neither
old
nor
young
man
or
woman
or
child
all
of
them
will
have
to
be
killed
off
said
ned
decidedly
the
world
ca
be
really
civilised
while
they
are
in
it
that
is
what
will
have
to
be
done
replied
father
brian
we
had
them
as
bad
as
he
is
in
the
old
days
in
ireland
picts
and
scots
they
were
and
cornishmen
that
came
over
to
harry
the
land
the
worst
of
all
were
the
giants
like
finn
and
his
big
brethren
what
wouldst
thou
think
of
sikend
now
my
boy
if
he
were
twelve
feet
high
and
had
four
arms
to
kill
with
instead
of
only
twain
his
mouth
blowing
fire
and
his
every
stride
more
than
the
length
of
a
tall
man
i
should
go
for
him
with
a
rifle
at
long
range
said
ned
hullo
father
brian
there
the
king
own
ship
ahead
of
us
going
right
into
the
humber
we
are
all
to
follow
him
they
said
that
land
yonder
is
england
hurrah
for
that
shouted
the
good
missionary
the
next
ship
behind
hardrada
is
tostig
hark
to
the
all
the
vikings
will
be
going
blood
wild
ah
my
boy
there
be
hard
fighting
before
long
it
not
one
battle
that
conquer
england
or
ireland
either
for
that
matter
all
the
ships
in
sight
were
obeying
their
orders
to
follow
the
king
the
wind
had
gone
down
and
they
could
fall
into
line
all
the
better
for
being
propelled
by
oars
as
ned
remarked
oars
were
as
good
as
steam
for
that
business
so
far
as
they
went
the
fleet
made
a
splendid
appearance
and
it
was
a
sight
worth
seeing
to
watch
so
many
banks
of
long
oars
dipping
and
lifting
together
it
is
a
tremendous
show
said
ned
to
father
brian
but
the
could
make
it
look
as
if
there
been
a
fire
in
half
an
hour
speak
latin
said
the
missionary
what
is
that
thou
wert
saying
i
do
know
one
word
of
saxon
it
a
tongue
they
all
get
rid
of
when
they
conquered
ned
made
an
effort
to
explain
himself
but
it
was
of
no
use
for
his
friend
knew
nothing
about
gunpowder
it
a
kind
of
witchcraft
most
likely
was
the
good
man
pious
conclusion
all
of
them
ought
to
be
burned
and
they
will
be
it
not
a
country
like
england
that
can
be
civilised
in
that
way
it
hath
been
on
my
mind
though
that
if
the
northmen
and
duke
william
kill
off
the
saxons
we
could
send
over
enough
of
the
right
kind
of
men
from
ireland
to
make
a
fine
land
of
it
you
could
do
that
replied
ned
loads
and
loads
of
irish
have
come
over
to
our
country
and
after
they
get
there
they
all
turn
into
americans
that
witchcraft
again
grumbled
father
brian
what
the
good
of
them
if
they
all
become
heathen
themselves
before
ned
could
decide
exactly
what
to
say
to
that
point
a
loud
shout
came
to
him
from
lars
mail
and
helmet
o
ned
the
son
of
webb
the
command
of
the
king
is
that
every
man
shall
land
in
full
armour
there
will
be
a
battle
right
away
hurrah
shouted
ned
and
up
sprang
the
good
missionary
exclaiming
i
be
there
myself
i
not
have
any
heathen
saxon
cut
my
throat
for
nothing
either
i
have
good
mail
under
my
cassock
and
i
can
swing
an
ax
with
any
of
them
get
thyself
ready
my
boy
thou
art
young
for
it
but
thou
canst
show
them
what
thou
art
made
of
ned
was
already
on
his
way
to
his
bunk
under
the
deck
to
put
on
his
battle
trappings
and
he
shortly
discovered
that
the
missionary
had
not
left
norway
or
it
might
be
ireland
unprovided
for
warlike
emergencies
the
shields
which
had
hung
along
the
bulwarks
of
the
during
the
voyage
were
now
transferred
to
the
strong
left
arms
of
their
owners
even
the
rowers
put
on
their
mail
after
rang
out
across
the
sea
chief
answering
chief
with
fierce
defiant
music
while
once
more
came
twanging
with
the
horn
blasts
the
sound
of
many
harps
it
was
an
hour
of
intense
excitement
for
the
armament
of
the
sea
king
had
come
to
decide
the
fate
and
future
of
a
great
empire
it
was
well
understood
by
all
moreover
that
it
was
to
be
met
by
a
saxon
king
and
general
harold
the
son
of
godwin
who
was
believed
to
be
equal
to
alfred
the
great
himself
in
either
or
ned
had
noticed
that
the
vikings
did
not
often
speak
of
him
as
king
but
rather
by
the
old
title
of
harold
the
earl
under
which
he
had
earned
his
fame
as
earl
of
wessex
and
as
prime
minister
of
edward
the
confessor
he
had
long
been
the
actual
ruler
of
england
dreaded
by
its
enemies
and
greatly
beloved
by
its
people
ned
also
remembered
that
the
west
saxons
had
been
alfred
own
people
his
original
kingdom
it
worked
like
a
kind
of
hub
he
said
and
the
other
kingdoms
of
the
old
heptarchy
were
stuck
on
one
after
another
father
brian
says
that
some
of
them
are
hitched
on
a
little
loosely
even
now
and
that
harold
can
not
make
them
obey
him
any
too
well
that
may
get
him
whipped
in
this
fight
the
humber
is
a
bay
long
and
wide
which
narrows
gradually
toward
the
place
where
the
river
ouse
runs
into
it
the
invading
fleet
was
therefore
compelled
to
accommodate
its
order
and
movement
to
the
shape
and
area
of
the
water
it
was
now
rowing
into
it
soon
began
to
string
out
with
a
narrower
front
and
the
was
not
one
of
the
foremost
vessels
i
should
like
to
see
the
first
of
them
get
ashore
said
ned
to
father
brian
thou
art
all
too
late
for
that
replied
the
good
missionary
our
ship
came
right
along
with
nothing
else
to
do
but
hardrada
men
have
been
working
havoc
everywhere
there
hath
been
hard
fighting
in
the
scotch
islands
that
the
orkneys
and
shetland
and
a
good
many
scots
are
with
him
now
didst
thou
know
he
had
ships
and
men
from
iceland
where
the
fire
mountain
is
no
said
ned
that
a
long
way
off
so
it
is
continued
father
brian
and
they
are
a
bit
civilised
up
there
and
while
we
have
sailed
along
part
of
hardrada
army
hath
been
harrying
the
coast
of
yorkshire
they
call
it
to
no
good
that
i
can
see
now
he
hath
pulled
them
all
together
and
if
he
doth
not
get
himself
killed
he
will
conquer
the
north
of
england
first
it
is
on
my
mind
that
he
hath
been
wasting
his
chances
we
shall
soon
see
about
that
how
and
where
the
landing
was
to
be
made
was
indeed
a
matter
of
great
importance
narrower
became
the
channel
of
the
humber
and
still
the
long
line
of
ships
rowed
steadily
on
no
man
could
say
just
where
the
humber
ended
and
the
ouse
began
before
long
the
mouth
of
a
river
was
reached
on
the
left
that
was
the
don
and
ned
did
not
see
any
ships
go
into
it
not
a
great
deal
farther
up
on
the
same
side
was
another
stream
flowing
into
the
ouse
and
that
was
the
river
aire
it
of
no
use
to
hardrada
said
father
brian
what
he
wanteth
to
do
now
is
to
get
his
grip
on
thy
own
city
of
york
and
maybe
he
will
a
sort
of
gloomy
doubt
seemed
to
be
growing
in
the
mind
of
the
good
missionary
and
he
evidently
had
military
ideas
of
his
own
thou
mayest
remember
he
remarked
to
ned
that
the
women
at
place
made
no
wailing
at
all
when
their
men
marched
away
i
am
told
that
it
was
not
so
elsewhere
the
women
wept
as
if
they
were
mourning
and
all
the
old
ones
that
are
half
foretold
bad
luck
there
hath
many
a
bad
luck
sign
been
spoken
of
here
we
are
though
so
they
were
and
the
now
more
swiftly
rowed
ships
of
the
vikings
were
crowding
one
another
somewhat
in
the
narrow
ouse
lars
came
in
full
armour
to
stand
by
ned
and
gaze
at
the
woodlands
the
cultivated
fields
and
the
homesteads
on
either
bank
he
had
been
almost
a
talkative
boy
in
norway
among
his
hawks
and
hounds
and
the
scenery
he
was
accustomed
to
ever
since
coming
on
board
the
however
he
had
seemed
another
fellow
he
was
tall
and
strong
for
his
age
and
his
yellow
hair
was
put
up
in
a
long
braid
which
the
back
rim
of
his
steel
cap
appeared
to
rest
on
his
bright
gray
eyes
were
full
of
excitement
but
his
lips
were
tightly
closed
as
if
it
were
impossible
for
him
to
express
something
or
was
resolutely
keeping
it
in
what
the
matter
lars
asked
ned
father
is
angry
with
the
king
said
lars
the
troops
are
to
land
all
along
shore
that
will
scatter
them
he
saith
and
some
of
them
will
be
cut
to
pieces
by
these
danes
and
angles
of
northumberland
father
doth
not
believe
that
thy
earl
tostig
can
do
anything
with
them
all
the
news
is
bad
that
was
the
longest
speech
ned
had
heard
him
make
since
leaving
norway
and
father
brian
at
once
replied
to
it
thy
father
a
man
of
sense
my
boy
i
am
thinking
i
will
keep
myself
a
good
piece
in
the
rear
of
this
army
rather
than
at
the
front
where
men
get
killed
anyhow
the
had
advanced
steadily
and
she
was
now
passing
the
mouth
of
the
river
derwent
on
the
right
large
numbers
of
vessels
of
all
sizes
which
had
been
ahead
of
her
were
already
making
fast
at
convenient
places
along
the
banks
from
each
of
these
were
put
out
and
lines
of
warriors
were
marching
forth
upon
the
land
from
other
ships
at
anchor
out
in
the
stream
boats
were
plying
but
father
brian
was
not
looking
at
them
he
was
gazing
very
critically
down
the
river
there
they
go
he
muttered
all
those
men
that
are
landing
away
down
yonder
below
the
mouth
of
the
derwent
will
have
that
bit
of
water
and
swamp
between
them
and
us
they
are
cut
off
from
doing
any
good
if
the
rest
of
us
get
into
a
battle
maybe
it
good
generalship
and
maybe
it
is
i
wish
hardrada
were
an
irishman
and
he
never
have
split
his
army
in
two
a
very
strong
force
of
northmen
was
getting
ashore
with
hardrada
above
the
mouth
of
the
derwent
nevertheless
and
among
them
before
long
were
all
the
passengers
of
the
there
was
nobody
there
to
oppose
them
the
earls
of
northumberland
and
mercia
edwin
and
morcar
had
expected
hardrada
to
come
but
not
so
soon
and
they
had
not
dreamed
that
he
would
push
right
on
up
the
river
to
land
so
near
them
they
were
not
ready
therefore
and
the
king
of
norway
had
now
posted
his
army
in
strong
positions
while
the
frightened
people
who
had
fled
at
his
coming
were
telling
the
news
in
the
city
of
york
the
horses
what
there
were
of
them
were
also
coming
ashore
but
it
was
evident
that
the
invading
army
would
have
no
cavalry
to
speak
of
that
is
the
worst
of
it
by
any
means
remarked
ned
the
son
of
webb
as
he
marched
along
with
vebba
men
england
can
never
be
conquered
without
artillery
if
king
harold
or
the
saxon
earls
could
bring
out
a
few
batteries
of
maxim
guns
or
of
like
those
of
the
fourth
artillery
they
could
tear
up
this
invasion
before
saturday
night
the
landing
of
so
great
an
army
was
a
matter
of
time
and
toil
and
it
was
well
indeed
for
the
vikings
that
there
were
neither
forts
nor
forces
for
them
to
encounter
at
the
outset
even
when
sunset
came
and
after
that
the
darkness
ship
after
ship
as
it
arrived
was
hastily
unladen
every
man
stepping
ashore
with
an
idea
that
he
might
be
marching
into
an
immediate
collision
with
the
saxons
it
is
pretty
good
luck
we
have
had
thus
far
said
father
brian
in
spite
of
the
old
women
of
norway
but
no
man
ever
knoweth
exactly
when
the
luck
will
turn
if
it
against
him
and
if
he
is
careless
about
what
he
is
doing
there
is
always
bad
luck
in
that
chapter
viii
the
scouting
party
there
was
no
large
town
at
or
near
the
mouth
of
the
humber
there
were
villages
along
the
coast
however
and
the
uplands
on
either
shore
were
dotted
with
hamlets
and
cabins
there
were
also
comfortable
farmhouses
and
the
residences
of
the
richer
landholders
to
all
sorts
of
people
the
fishermen
had
brought
in
early
warning
of
the
coming
of
the
norway
fleet
time
had
been
given
for
getting
away
and
for
the
removal
of
much
property
to
places
of
comparative
safety
therefore
every
house
which
the
invaders
had
entered
upon
landing
had
been
found
nearly
empty
to
the
great
disgust
of
the
brave
vikings
didst
thou
see
the
carts
that
went
ashore
from
the
ships
asked
father
brian
of
his
young
friend
the
horses
were
fetched
along
to
pull
them
and
not
for
riding
they
will
go
out
to
gather
all
left
or
there
be
a
famine
in
the
army
the
king
orders
are
not
to
kill
anybody
that
is
fighting
said
ned
tostig
lost
his
earldom
by
being
cruel
to
the
people
now
he
is
going
to
try
and
make
himself
popular
he
will
not
do
that
said
father
brian
they
know
the
hard
hand
he
put
on
them
it
a
pity
indeed
about
the
cattle
and
horses
my
boy
i
afraid
we
will
get
none
there
is
only
one
kind
of
cattle
that
the
english
could
take
with
them
what
that
asked
ned
it
the
pigs
replied
the
good
missionary
not
one
of
them
could
be
driven
easily
and
there
will
be
fresh
pork
in
camp
all
the
big
houses
too
have
more
or
less
bacon
in
them
and
dried
fish
i
will
talk
no
more
now
this
is
the
place
that
vebba
hath
chosen
for
our
sleeping
it
was
an
open
place
among
trees
well
on
in
the
advance
but
within
the
army
outposts
no
tents
had
been
provided
and
once
more
did
ned
the
son
of
webb
distinguish
himself
by
the
miraculous
rapidity
with
which
he
kindled
a
he
was
likely
to
become
a
favourite
with
the
men
if
this
was
to
go
on
although
sikend
the
berserker
stared
at
him
gloomily
and
muttered
something
dangerous
about
killing
wizards
by
that
fire
a
great
deal
of
cooking
was
done
that
evening
even
sikend
broiling
his
fresh
pork
as
if
he
had
no
prejudices
that
did
come
from
any
of
the
ships
remarked
ned
as
he
saw
the
supplies
of
butcher
meat
even
of
beef
brought
in
i
suppose
it
is
what
army
men
call
foraging
and
it
another
name
for
plundering
i
hope
they
did
have
to
kill
anybody
but
that
what
they
want
to
do
more
than
anything
else
the
night
was
pleasant
but
it
was
long
before
ned
could
shut
his
eyes
not
that
he
could
see
anything
with
them
at
more
than
a
few
yards
from
the
fires
the
dull
glare
of
these
shone
upon
polished
shields
and
armour
here
and
there
he
could
see
too
the
dim
shapes
of
sentries
and
patrols
standing
still
or
walking
to
and
fro
they
did
not
often
have
occasion
to
speak
and
when
they
did
so
it
was
in
the
gruff
and
guarded
tones
of
men
on
the
watch
for
enemies
the
thing
which
more
than
anything
else
seemed
to
keep
him
awake
was
a
continual
dull
roar
which
filled
his
ears
and
worried
him
it
is
the
roar
of
waves
on
the
shore
he
thought
that
may
be
part
of
it
but
i
guess
there
is
something
more
i
know
now
it
is
the
sound
of
the
camp
it
is
the
roar
of
the
army
i
remember
in
new
york
if
a
fellow
gets
up
before
daylight
and
looks
out
of
a
window
it
is
all
pretty
still
until
he
listens
then
he
will
hear
something
like
this
a
good
deal
like
the
roar
of
a
waterfall
then
as
the
morning
goes
along
the
racket
grows
with
the
carts
and
everything
till
he
gets
so
used
to
it
that
he
ca
hear
it
any
longer
there
are
so
many
thousands
of
men
here
and
i
should
wonder
if
a
good
many
of
were
snoring
he
could
rest
more
quietly
after
he
understood
that
mighty
hum
but
it
was
not
yet
sunrise
when
he
was
awakened
by
a
jerk
of
his
left
elbow
get
up
my
boy
said
the
voice
of
father
brian
i
roused
lars
i
have
something
for
both
of
you
we
will
eat
our
breakfast
at
once
and
then
we
be
off
i
have
permission
from
vebba
to
go
out
scouting
among
the
heathen
saxons
it
fine
scouting
exclaimed
ned
springing
up
and
reaching
for
his
mail
of
all
things
i
ready
i
awfully
hungry
too
a
breakfast
of
fresh
pork
broiled
at
the
end
of
a
stick
and
nothing
to
go
with
it
but
water
may
be
prepared
and
eaten
without
much
waste
of
time
neither
lars
nor
ned
felt
like
making
a
long
affair
of
it
but
his
reverence
was
the
first
to
throw
away
his
come
along
now
he
exclaimed
the
beasts
are
tethered
handy
i
pulled
them
out
of
a
drove
that
was
gathered
by
the
men
we
have
bridles
but
no
saddles
and
i
ridden
that
way
many
a
time
in
ireland
bless
her
not
that
these
mercia
ponies
are
at
all
the
equal
of
our
irish
horses
the
best
in
all
the
world
can
be
found
among
the
farms
around
clontarf
in
a
minute
or
so
more
they
and
a
tall
viking
who
was
to
go
with
them
were
loosening
the
halters
of
four
but
somewhat
horses
they
were
not
properly
to
be
called
ponies
being
larger
and
heavier
than
the
shelties
of
scotland
or
the
small
horses
of
wales
they
belonged
to
a
peculiar
breed
which
was
at
that
time
very
numerous
in
england
not
one
of
them
objected
to
being
mounted
and
the
four
scouts
galloped
away
unchallenged
by
any
sentinel
no
man
will
hinder
us
remarked
father
brian
i
think
that
tostig
the
earl
is
wise
he
gave
out
that
all
spies
might
come
and
go
freely
he
willed
that
the
english
earls
should
be
told
what
coming
to
them
i
do
believe
they
will
be
scared
very
badly
replied
ned
hardrada
is
going
to
win
in
that
way
everybody
knows
that
the
english
will
fight
the
sun
was
rising
now
and
all
the
camps
behind
them
were
astir
more
ships
were
reaching
and
more
troops
were
coming
on
shore
but
not
by
any
means
the
whole
of
hardrada
army
was
as
yet
in
shape
for
a
great
battle
it
would
be
well
for
him
to
advance
with
great
prudence
until
his
full
strength
should
be
with
him
and
he
was
doing
so
the
same
kind
of
caution
might
have
been
well
for
the
northumberland
and
mercian
earls
edwin
and
morcar
but
they
were
even
now
preparing
to
strike
without
waiting
to
gather
sufficient
forces
they
had
been
unready
and
now
they
were
hasty
the
country
was
beautiful
it
did
not
seem
to
be
densely
peopled
there
were
many
farms
however
which
seemed
to
ned
to
be
under
pretty
good
cultivation
empty
desolate
abandoned
were
all
the
dwellings
past
which
the
scouts
rode
onward
there
were
no
cattle
to
be
seen
in
the
fields
there
hath
been
no
burning
as
yet
remarked
the
tall
viking
tostig
hath
forbidden
fire
to
the
great
discontent
of
many
of
what
good
indeed
is
war
if
we
are
not
to
burn
and
slay
it
is
but
little
better
than
peace
o
thou
leif
the
son
of
beo
broke
in
father
brian
angrily
if
thou
art
in
the
advance
on
the
morrow
or
the
next
day
i
think
the
heathen
saxons
will
show
thee
war
enough
woden
be
praised
for
that
exclaimed
the
viking
i
think
they
will
the
valkyrias
will
come
for
many
i
shall
die
no
cow
death
i
would
that
thor
and
his
hammer
and
all
the
hero
gods
of
the
north
might
come
and
fight
for
king
harold
of
norway
hear
him
muttered
the
good
missionary
and
men
like
him
call
themselves
christians
i
would
as
soon
be
an
englishman
the
english
are
not
heathens
said
ned
the
son
of
webb
alfred
the
great
was
the
best
kind
of
man
no
doubt
said
father
brian
and
a
bad
lot
he
had
to
deal
with
he
was
helped
much
by
the
right
sort
of
educated
missionaries
from
ireland
men
like
myself
that
could
read
and
write
i
am
glad
my
boy
to
be
here
now
and
carry
on
the
good
work
hark
what
that
ride
fast
all
there
is
evil
ahead
hear
that
shrieking
of
women
a
little
beyond
them
was
a
sharp
turn
in
the
narrow
road
they
were
following
and
on
either
side
were
dense
woods
forward
dashed
the
four
horsemen
headed
by
the
now
excited
missionary
and
they
all
drew
rein
to
reconnoitre
the
situation
as
soon
as
they
had
galloped
around
the
turn
here
was
a
sight
to
see
indeed
the
land
beyond
at
the
right
was
under
cultivation
cut
up
into
enclosures
of
various
sizes
there
were
many
cabins
and
out
of
the
hamlet
composed
of
them
led
other
roads
some
distance
back
from
the
middle
of
the
hamlet
was
an
manse
or
large
farmhouse
and
around
this
was
a
pretty
strong
stockade
bordered
by
a
deep
ditch
this
was
the
local
fort
into
which
all
the
near
neighbours
were
expected
to
run
for
safety
in
case
of
sudden
peril
that
they
had
at
the
present
time
done
so
was
evident
for
it
was
from
within
the
stockade
that
the
shrieks
and
cries
were
arising
there
are
none
of
them
hurt
yet
i
trust
said
father
brian
look
at
them
though
the
wolves
of
norway
they
are
putting
fire
to
the
stockade
to
burn
a
hole
in
it
they
are
swearing
to
slay
every
soul
for
only
shutting
the
gate
against
them
i
am
glad
they
were
slow
in
their
fire
making
said
ned
that
was
flint
and
steel
work
it
a
good
thing
they
did
have
any
parlour
matches
one
cartridge
of
dynamite
though
would
blow
that
stockade
every
which
way
or
a
can
of
powder
ned
the
son
of
webb
shouted
father
brian
thou
art
tostig
man
the
poor
folk
in
the
fort
belong
to
his
earldom
ride
in
with
me
now
and
bid
those
vikings
that
they
must
obey
the
earl
and
the
king
they
may
listen
growled
leif
the
son
of
beo
or
they
may
slay
us
all
for
interfering
i
have
split
a
man
head
myself
for
less
than
that
ride
on
ned
felt
all
his
pulses
tingling
as
he
urged
onward
his
horse
for
the
screams
of
terror
were
increasing
and
well
they
might
several
of
the
angry
marauders
assailing
the
stockade
were
chopping
at
it
furiously
with
their
and
there
was
no
doubt
but
what
they
would
shortly
cut
their
way
in
he
shouted
loudly
but
the
vikings
did
not
seem
to
hear
or
heed
him
and
almost
before
he
knew
it
he
was
at
the
little
bridge
across
the
moat
in
front
of
the
great
gate
of
the
stockade
this
bridge
should
have
been
removed
long
since
by
the
garrison
but
for
some
reason
or
other
it
had
stuck
fast
rendering
the
ditch
of
small
account
as
a
defence
down
to
the
ground
sprang
father
brian
at
that
moment
in
hand
and
down
dropped
ned
while
lars
and
leif
the
son
of
beo
bravely
followed
them
here
therefore
stood
the
four
scouts
like
heroes
with
their
backs
to
the
gate
this
was
massively
made
of
oaken
planks
fastened
with
iron
spikes
and
was
likely
to
withstand
much
chopping
as
yet
it
appeared
that
no
blood
had
been
shed
on
either
side
but
there
could
be
no
doubt
but
what
the
saxons
or
angles
or
whatever
they
were
would
sell
their
lives
dearly
the
vikings
do
seem
to
care
a
straw
for
anything
i
said
groaned
ned
i
do
suppose
they
take
scalps
but
they
kill
women
and
children
as
if
they
were
so
many
sioux
indians
i
suppose
the
english
would
be
just
as
cruel
if
they
had
a
chance
i
wish
the
world
were
civilised
come
on
ye
wolves
of
norway
roared
the
valiant
priest
at
his
side
but
i
bid
ye
hold
your
hands
by
the
order
of
harold
the
king
and
tostig
the
earl
ye
will
have
to
slay
us
four
ere
ye
break
in
to
murder
the
people
of
the
earl
one
who
seemed
a
chief
among
the
vikings
paused
only
to
blow
a
strong
blast
on
his
and
then
he
came
angrily
forward
toward
brian
i
know
thee
not
he
said
thou
art
an
outlander
and
a
saga
man
but
i
know
thy
companions
that
youth
is
a
son
of
my
friend
vebba
of
nordensfiord
with
him
is
vebba
the
boy
with
a
strange
tongue
i
know
to
be
a
lithsman
of
tostig
the
earl
were
we
to
slay
him
we
were
but
lost
men
the
orders
are
hard
but
i
will
obey
them
only
that
we
will
make
prize
of
all
casks
of
ale
and
of
whatever
is
fit
to
eat
blood
we
will
not
shed
to
that
we
all
give
assent
shouted
a
man
voice
from
within
the
stockade
upon
that
pledge
we
will
open
the
gate
we
belong
to
tostig
the
earl
and
therefore
we
did
not
flee
at
his
coming
we
will
keep
faith
with
you
responded
the
viking
leader
ned
the
son
of
webb
hath
the
right
in
this
matter
he
doeth
well
to
protect
the
people
of
his
earl
i
approve
him
open
the
gate
open
it
swung
and
those
who
were
within
waited
fearlessly
for
all
the
northmen
could
be
trusted
to
do
no
unnecessary
murder
after
they
had
plighted
faith
with
friend
or
foe
go
not
in
whispered
father
brian
to
ned
the
people
are
safer
than
thou
art
and
there
are
black
looks
sent
at
thee
thou
hast
robbed
wolves
of
their
prey
and
they
will
bite
thee
if
they
may
there
came
a
sound
of
galloping
hoofs
around
the
turn
in
the
road
as
ned
and
his
friends
were
getting
upon
their
horses
in
a
minute
more
all
the
open
spaces
of
the
hamlet
swarmed
with
armed
riders
and
there
arose
a
shout
of
tostig
the
earl
forward
rode
father
brian
while
leif
the
son
of
beo
restrained
the
others
let
him
report
for
us
he
said
i
like
not
to
have
speech
with
that
son
of
earl
godwin
he
smiteth
suddenly
when
his
spear
is
in
his
hand
and
none
may
account
with
him
they
saw
the
haughty
and
cruel
earl
draw
his
rein
face
to
face
with
the
missionary
and
all
could
hear
the
loud
clear
tones
of
the
questions
and
answers
which
followed
brief
enough
were
these
and
tostig
seemed
to
be
in
a
fairly
good
state
of
mind
it
is
well
he
said
ned
the
son
of
webb
hath
guarded
his
neighbours
i
blame
him
not
but
let
him
beware
how
he
interfereth
too
much
i
have
many
a
head
to
strike
off
in
this
rebellious
northumberland
i
will
spare
not
one
of
those
who
drove
me
out
well
was
it
understood
that
his
proud
heart
was
full
of
revenge
and
that
his
return
as
a
victor
would
bring
woe
to
many
at
this
point
nevertheless
the
squadron
of
horsemen
halted
drawing
away
from
the
roadside
as
if
waiting
we
have
done
our
duty
said
father
brian
to
leif
had
we
not
stayed
that
slaughter
there
had
been
sharp
vengeance
taken
the
men
may
thank
the
son
of
webb
and
thee
said
leif
so
may
the
angles
for
else
they
were
all
dead
ere
this
there
cometh
the
vanguard
there
will
be
a
battle
this
day
it
cometh
shortly
said
the
missionary
it
is
but
nine
miles
from
the
river
to
the
city
gates
the
king
will
strike
before
morcar
and
edwin
have
time
to
gather
more
forces
we
will
go
on
with
them
said
ned
i
would
not
miss
seeing
that
battle
for
anything
that
what
i
came
for
keep
well
behind
the
foremost
lines
then
said
his
reverend
friend
serve
tostig
if
thou
wilt
but
strike
not
any
of
thine
own
people
york
is
thy
city
and
thou
wilt
be
back
in
it
before
many
hours
hurrah
for
that
exclaimed
ned
i
want
a
good
look
at
it
as
it
is
now
thousand
after
thousand
the
host
of
hardrada
pressed
forward
other
columns
of
the
invaders
were
advancing
by
other
roads
and
across
the
fields
and
through
the
woods
there
would
be
enough
of
them
to
make
a
strong
front
at
any
place
where
the
men
of
northumberland
might
meet
them
not
with
the
vanguard
but
between
two
solid
bodies
of
northern
spearmen
did
ned
the
son
of
webb
and
his
three
friends
push
forward
toward
the
first
great
battle
that
was
to
be
fought
in
england
by
hardrada
the
sea
king
and
his
terrible
army
chapter
ix
the
great
fulford
fight
the
battle
was
at
hand
and
all
the
men
knew
that
they
were
marching
into
it
i
in
shouted
ned
the
son
of
webb
but
i
have
any
horn
to
blow
hear
they
are
all
going
wild
fighting
is
what
they
live
for
and
they
not
good
for
much
of
anything
else
to
speak
of
no
generalship
whatever
was
exercised
in
the
selection
of
the
the
lay
of
the
land
as
ned
remarked
of
it
had
provided
all
that
beforehand
and
it
gave
no
especial
advantage
to
either
army
nearly
midway
between
the
river
ouse
on
the
left
of
the
vikings
and
the
river
derwent
on
their
right
was
the
moderately
elevated
level
of
land
along
which
they
were
marching
the
banks
of
the
rivers
on
either
side
of
them
were
swampy
it
would
have
seemed
good
military
policy
for
the
english
earls
to
abide
behind
the
strong
walls
of
york
after
having
missed
the
opportunity
to
meet
their
enemies
at
the
landing
they
may
however
have
been
aware
that
a
large
part
of
hardrada
forces
had
landed
below
the
mouth
of
the
derwent
and
was
still
on
the
wrong
side
of
that
river
this
perhaps
induced
them
to
strike
a
blow
at
the
nearer
division
before
it
should
be
reinforced
here
we
are
shouted
ned
as
he
rode
out
from
a
patch
of
wood
see
how
our
lines
are
forming
all
the
way
across
between
the
swamps
look
yonder
standards
and
clouds
of
dust
the
english
are
coming
a
host
of
them
the
king
hath
ordered
us
to
halt
and
let
them
charge
replied
lars
this
is
my
first
battle
hurrah
hail
to
thee
o
my
son
glad
am
i
to
find
thee
called
out
a
loud
voice
from
a
column
of
spearmen
catching
up
with
them
come
thou
and
join
thy
father
men
thou
shalt
fight
at
my
side
this
day
let
ned
the
son
of
webb
ride
on
and
be
with
tostig
the
earl
as
is
his
duty
all
right
shouted
ned
go
ahead
lars
god
keep
you
all
this
day
earnestly
responded
father
brian
i
will
keep
the
boy
out
of
harm
way
if
i
can
by
the
side
of
earl
tostig
in
this
fight
will
be
a
place
for
strong
men
leif
the
son
of
beo
wheeled
away
with
lars
and
ned
shouted
after
them
oh
vebba
i
am
coming
to
join
thee
and
lars
as
soon
as
we
have
taken
york
maybe
thou
wilt
and
maybe
thou
wilt
not
growled
father
brian
a
good
many
vikings
are
to
be
killed
before
sunset
look
how
the
saxons
come
on
i
am
willing
to
keep
well
away
from
their
axes
so
was
ned
himself
and
being
on
horseback
on
pretty
high
ground
he
was
able
to
get
a
fair
view
of
all
that
was
going
on
except
for
arrows
and
javelins
all
the
fighting
would
be
hand
to
hand
so
that
personal
skill
and
strength
would
count
for
all
they
were
worth
while
the
small
and
weak
were
pretty
sure
to
go
down
there
is
the
banner
of
king
hardrada
said
ned
away
at
the
left
toward
the
ouse
river
i
guess
tostig
is
with
him
and
i
wo
go
in
that
direction
father
brian
and
i
can
see
more
if
we
stay
in
the
middle
whoop
here
comes
the
crash
it
awful
it
was
the
tremendous
onset
of
the
english
it
struck
the
norwegian
line
first
at
the
right
and
all
opposition
seemed
to
be
crushed
before
it
there
could
be
no
question
of
the
courage
or
prowess
of
the
northumberland
warriors
and
their
earls
were
leading
them
well
all
the
saints
exclaimed
father
brian
are
we
to
be
beaten
at
once
then
i
am
thankful
that
thou
and
i
will
have
a
chance
to
ride
away
for
the
english
will
spare
no
man
wait
a
bit
replied
ned
the
king
and
the
earl
are
charging
in
all
their
best
men
are
with
them
see
the
rush
of
hardrada
with
his
sword
he
is
like
a
man
he
is
a
giant
he
had
a
sudden
advantage
given
him
too
for
the
english
followed
the
routed
vikings
on
the
right
so
that
their
own
flank
was
exposed
they
were
necessarily
in
some
disorder
when
the
rush
of
the
king
veterans
struck
them
even
numbers
were
at
this
point
much
in
favour
of
the
invaders
and
there
was
soon
a
change
in
the
aspect
of
the
battle
hard
terrible
desperate
was
that
long
struggle
of
life
and
death
the
slaughter
thinned
the
ranks
on
both
sides
fearfully
more
and
more
intense
became
the
interest
of
ned
the
son
of
webb
and
his
companion
almost
unconsciously
they
pushed
forward
to
get
a
nearer
view
of
the
combat
the
contending
forces
were
in
many
places
so
mingled
that
it
was
hardly
possible
to
distinguish
one
party
from
the
other
the
din
was
dreadful
hullo
suddenly
exclaimed
ned
i
declare
father
brian
horse
has
run
away
with
him
i
hope
he
wo
be
killed
his
own
animal
also
grew
restive
and
the
next
minute
he
was
charging
forward
as
if
to
take
his
share
in
the
battle
i
ca
hold
him
in
groaned
ned
tugging
at
his
rein
he
is
worse
than
nanny
herself
there
though
the
english
are
breaking
everywhere
it
going
to
be
a
victory
for
us
oh
dear
this
fellow
is
taking
me
right
along
to
the
very
front
there
was
peril
indeed
in
that
there
was
no
telling
how
far
or
into
what
the
now
frantic
beast
might
gallop
on
bound
after
bound
neighing
loudly
with
fear
he
dashed
forward
into
the
very
thickest
of
the
awful
carnage
while
his
rider
stared
wildly
around
him
upon
the
slayers
and
the
slain
oh
yelled
ned
that
spear
struck
him
i
must
get
off
he
is
falling
one
of
the
hundreds
of
flying
javelins
had
smitten
his
horse
in
the
chest
burying
its
long
sharp
blade
almost
a
foot
deep
down
sank
the
dying
victim
snorting
screaming
and
ned
sprang
off
only
just
in
time
to
escape
from
being
rolled
under
him
i
did
it
all
the
better
he
remarked
for
having
no
saddle
or
stirrups
out
came
his
sword
but
before
he
could
do
anything
with
it
the
rush
of
the
battle
swept
on
beyond
him
the
english
were
now
retreating
in
disorder
but
the
greater
part
of
them
were
fighting
as
they
went
many
of
them
it
was
afterward
said
were
driven
into
the
swamps
and
into
the
rivers
but
the
stories
told
were
probably
exaggerated
at
all
events
thousands
of
them
were
slain
and
the
defeat
of
edwin
and
morcar
was
decisive
ned
was
on
foot
now
and
he
had
marched
forward
for
he
did
not
see
that
he
was
in
any
danger
they
wo
hold
up
till
they
get
to
york
he
was
saying
just
see
this
he
was
standing
at
a
spot
where
the
flying
english
had
made
a
despairing
rally
and
all
around
him
were
scattered
scores
of
slain
or
disabled
warriors
at
his
very
feet
was
a
sort
of
half
circle
of
them
and
he
was
staring
at
their
shattered
armour
when
a
loud
cry
arose
from
a
mailed
form
which
had
lain
at
full
length
upon
the
bloody
grass
one
more
it
shouted
i
will
strike
one
more
good
blow
against
the
outlanders
out
out
holy
cross
down
with
thee
o
wolf
of
norway
ned
the
son
of
webb
had
barely
time
to
lift
his
shield
before
his
enemy
was
upon
him
he
was
nearly
taken
by
surprise
glad
my
sword
was
out
he
said
but
what
the
use
of
hacking
at
such
an
iron
rig
as
his
is
i
ca
hurt
him
my
suit
is
a
good
one
too
let
him
chop
away
it
was
on
his
mind
that
more
of
the
dead
or
wounded
saxons
might
get
up
and
come
at
him
however
and
he
felt
that
he
was
in
the
worst
kind
of
scrape
what
would
have
been
the
result
if
his
opponent
had
been
fresh
and
unwounded
was
easy
to
calculate
for
he
was
a
large
strong
man
as
it
was
ned
greater
agility
and
skill
were
enabling
him
to
make
a
particularly
good
fighting
appearance
when
something
large
and
dark
came
springing
to
his
side
down
roared
a
terrible
voice
and
a
flash
of
steel
fell
cleavingly
upon
the
helmet
of
the
big
saxon
he
dropped
as
if
struck
by
lightning
and
then
ned
found
himself
looking
up
with
astonishment
into
the
fierce
face
of
tostig
the
earl
art
thou
here
he
exclaimed
verily
thou
hast
done
well
but
thou
art
no
match
for
such
as
he
he
was
one
of
the
strongest
knaves
that
rebelled
against
me
o
son
of
webb
i
will
remember
thee
well
for
this
ned
hardly
knew
what
to
say
in
reply
and
the
earl
face
grew
thoughtful
thou
art
of
york
he
said
i
bid
thee
take
thy
first
opportunity
to
get
inside
of
the
walls
learn
all
thou
mayest
and
be
ready
to
answer
when
i
question
thee
i
would
know
what
is
said
in
the
city
i
will
get
in
as
soon
as
i
can
said
ned
but
just
how
i
know
away
spurred
the
earl
and
ned
looked
after
him
remarking
he
is
a
tremendous
fellow
i
guess
he
saved
my
life
and
i
kind
like
him
i
wonder
though
if
he
thinks
that
i
killed
all
of
these
danes
and
angles
and
saxons
that
are
lying
around
here
if
he
does
i
must
explain
it
to
him
some
day
i
would
care
to
have
it
look
as
if
i
told
him
so
it
was
too
late
for
any
explanations
at
the
present
time
and
he
was
ruefully
considering
what
it
might
be
best
for
him
to
try
next
when
a
cheerful
but
somewhat
anxious
voice
came
to
him
from
a
little
distance
ned
my
boy
it
exclaimed
art
thou
there
i
am
glad
indeed
to
find
thee
hold
on
till
i
get
to
thee
come
on
father
brian
shouted
back
ned
where
is
thy
horse
mine
was
killed
by
a
spear
the
evil
beast
pitched
me
into
the
grass
responded
the
missionary
rapidly
striding
nearer
i
will
see
if
i
can
get
me
another
before
long
i
will
do
no
walking
if
there
is
a
horse
to
be
had
mark
thou
this
though
hardrada
hath
won
this
battle
of
fulford
truly
but
it
hath
cost
him
more
men
than
he
can
spare
if
the
english
are
going
to
fight
like
this
the
vikings
will
all
be
killed
before
the
land
is
conquered
it
is
about
as
i
told
thee
it
would
be
they
have
harold
of
england
to
deal
with
yet
the
was
a
fearful
place
for
any
man
to
stroll
around
in
nearly
the
entire
space
between
the
two
marshes
was
littered
with
corpses
in
many
places
the
slain
lay
in
heaps
which
told
of
especially
severe
encounters
or
pitiless
massacres
they
were
not
all
saxons
by
any
means
and
ned
could
understand
the
forebodings
of
his
intelligent
companion
whether
or
not
it
was
because
father
brian
was
a
highly
educated
man
and
could
both
read
and
write
he
seemed
to
be
something
of
a
general
if
not
also
of
a
statesman
the
distance
from
the
field
to
the
city
of
york
was
but
a
mile
or
so
and
all
that
was
left
of
the
english
army
was
already
safe
behind
the
walls
more
had
escaped
doubtless
than
the
vikings
were
willing
to
believe
or
tell
of
and
they
were
in
no
condition
for
an
immediate
attack
upon
strong
fortifications
no
more
of
the
invading
forces
were
as
yet
crossing
the
derwent
river
and
the
weary
victors
marched
on
to
make
their
camp
for
the
night
near
the
margin
of
that
stream
i
guess
tostig
will
have
enough
to
do
without
thinking
of
me
said
ned
to
himself
he
wo
send
for
me
anyhow
until
he
thinks
made
a
trip
to
york
and
back
what
on
earth
could
i
say
if
he
were
to
ask
me
what
street
there
i
lived
on
i
was
never
there
in
my
life
and
i
might
have
to
own
up
what
i
want
most
just
now
is
to
know
where
vebba
men
are
and
if
lars
did
any
fighting
i
do
think
they
got
to
the
front
at
this
hour
the
king
of
norway
and
his
officers
were
hard
at
work
finding
out
the
state
of
their
forces
and
trying
to
get
them
into
shape
for
whatever
might
be
coming
next
they
were
in
no
fear
of
any
immediate
attack
from
the
terribly
shattered
lines
of
the
english
earls
but
it
would
be
necessary
to
make
short
work
of
the
subjugation
of
the
northern
counties
of
england
these
as
to
their
boundaries
and
organisation
were
in
effect
nothing
more
than
old
kingdoms
of
the
saxon
heptarchy
as
changed
from
time
to
time
by
danish
and
other
conquests
there
was
no
such
thing
in
those
days
as
a
united
solid
england
several
kings
were
yet
to
reign
and
much
blood
was
to
be
spilled
before
such
a
result
as
that
would
be
accomplished
ned
the
son
of
webb
discovered
in
his
conversation
with
father
brian
as
they
walked
on
among
the
camps
that
his
friend
was
possessed
with
a
curious
idea
that
great
britain
for
its
good
must
some
day
be
annexed
to
ireland
then
my
boy
said
the
enthusiastic
missionary
thou
wilt
see
what
can
be
done
for
all
these
heathen
by
conversion
and
civilisation
and
education
this
will
become
almost
as
fine
a
land
to
live
in
as
ireland
itself
but
not
quite
they
had
little
difficulty
after
all
in
discovering
the
of
so
well
known
a
chief
as
vebba
when
it
was
reached
there
was
an
exceedingly
noisy
welcome
with
an
exchange
of
news
items
the
men
liked
ned
the
son
of
webb
even
sikend
the
berserker
shook
hands
with
him
for
he
had
heard
that
the
young
hero
from
york
had
been
seen
in
the
very
front
of
the
battle
doing
wonders
of
valour
and
afterward
chasing
the
beaten
saxons
and
danes
and
angles
into
the
swamps
of
the
ouse
what
a
dime
novel
it
all
is
thought
ned
and
vebba
men
take
their
share
of
the
victory
and
the
glory
although
they
were
not
in
it
at
all
why
if
it
were
in
our
army
old
vebba
might
be
promoted
to
be
a
brigadier
and
sikend
to
be
a
colonel
however
that
might
be
he
and
lars
had
a
tremendous
time
by
themselves
exchanging
yarns
and
experiences
and
then
they
slept
like
a
pair
of
warlike
tops
the
next
day
was
thursday
for
the
battle
had
been
fought
on
wednesday
all
the
army
knew
at
an
early
hour
that
messengers
were
coming
and
going
between
king
hardrada
on
the
one
side
and
the
english
earls
on
the
other
it
was
said
that
a
treaty
of
peace
was
making
and
that
the
king
of
norway
was
at
once
to
become
king
of
all
that
part
of
england
with
tostig
under
him
as
earl
of
northumberland
now
father
brian
inquired
ned
what
do
you
think
of
that
arrangement
what
do
i
think
of
it
indeed
replied
the
priest
it
needeth
no
thinking
it
is
as
plain
as
is
thy
nose
upon
thy
face
edwin
and
morcar
are
doing
the
thing
that
i
would
do
myself
if
i
were
in
their
place
they
are
skirmishing
to
gain
time
and
to
put
hardrada
into
as
deep
a
trap
as
they
can
dig
not
either
of
them
is
really
intending
to
give
up
anything
neither
thou
nor
i
would
be
in
a
hurry
to
give
up
an
earldom
and
surrender
to
the
vengeance
of
tostig
first
and
then
to
the
wrath
of
king
harold
of
england
thou
thinkest
they
are
playing
sharp
said
ned
if
that
is
so
then
all
we
have
to
do
is
to
watch
out
for
a
bit
and
we
hear
something
drop
according
to
your
idea
there
the
biggest
kind
of
a
mistake
being
made
by
hardrada
just
so
said
the
missionary
quite
thoughtfully
and
thou
and
i
may
not
remain
in
the
viking
camp
any
longer
than
we
can
help
the
command
given
thee
by
tostig
the
earl
upon
the
must
be
obeyed
by
thee
speedily
and
i
will
accompany
thee
into
york
all
right
said
ned
we
do
want
to
see
tostig
again
until
we
have
done
something
worth
while
let
us
now
walk
around
said
father
brian
talk
not
so
much
in
thy
saxon
tongue
i
wish
to
see
the
stamford
bridge
over
this
swampy
river
derwent
it
is
the
only
crossing
for
miles
and
miles
up
and
down
the
river
is
not
deep
enough
for
ships
i
think
it
is
a
part
of
the
trap
set
for
hardrada
what
he
needs
remarked
ned
is
a
lot
of
east
river
and
north
river
steam
they
would
take
over
a
whole
army
before
bank
hours
they
do
it
now
every
day
in
the
year
all
of
the
invading
army
that
was
on
the
york
side
of
the
derwent
was
now
lying
near
the
head
of
the
bridge
the
missionary
spoke
of
on
the
other
side
of
the
river
was
encamped
very
much
the
larger
part
of
the
remaining
strength
of
king
hardrada
to
this
larger
division
additions
were
all
the
while
coming
from
the
ships
in
the
humber
here
we
are
my
boy
said
father
brian
as
he
and
ned
came
to
the
bridge
it
is
a
good
one
what
there
is
of
it
but
it
narrow
and
there
is
no
fort
at
either
end
of
it
i
should
say
it
is
about
wide
enough
for
one
wagon
said
ned
two
of
them
could
pass
each
other
on
it
for
its
length
about
the
meanest
bridge
i
ever
saw
it
would
take
our
army
a
long
while
to
foot
it
across
that
thing
it
is
my
opinion
said
the
missionary
sombrely
that
every
last
man
of
king
hardrada
army
would
do
well
to
walk
over
it
this
day
one
way
or
the
other
and
join
forces
i
have
had
my
look
at
it
and
i
will
go
it
is
thy
duty
and
mine
to
get
into
the
city
of
york
as
soon
as
possible
and
stay
there
i
must
get
in
anyhow
said
ned
i
would
like
even
now
to
have
the
earl
come
riding
along
and
find
me
here
he
rough
i
think
any
man
would
want
to
get
behind
good
walls
just
now
though
unless
he
had
his
life
insured
pretty
heavily
in
good
companies
father
brian
stared
at
him
for
a
moment
but
that
was
one
of
many
of
the
sayings
of
ned
the
son
of
webb
to
which
the
good
man
did
not
attempt
to
make
any
reply
chapter
x
the
coming
of
harold
the
saxon
speak
thou
in
the
norway
tongue
for
thou
canst
that
these
who
stand
by
may
understand
thee
o
ned
the
son
of
webb
thou
wilt
now
find
thy
way
into
the
city
of
york
that
is
what
i
am
going
to
do
o
tostig
the
earl
responded
ned
i
can
get
in
somehow
or
other
go
thou
then
and
return
and
tell
me
if
edwin
and
morcar
are
gathering
more
armed
men
within
the
walls
bring
me
what
tidings
thou
shalt
hear
concerning
my
brother
harold
the
king
go
and
see
that
thou
have
a
care
for
thy
tongue
that
thou
bring
no
news
except
to
harold
hardrada
or
myself
i
can
keep
my
mouth
shut
said
ned
and
away
rode
the
stern
earl
accompanied
by
several
vikings
of
high
rank
who
had
entered
the
camp
of
vebba
with
him
ned
had
been
summoned
to
meet
the
earl
at
a
little
distance
from
his
own
norse
friends
and
not
even
vebba
himself
nor
father
brian
dared
question
him
afterward
too
closely
concerning
his
orders
from
the
very
dangerous
tempered
tostig
as
vebba
said
to
the
missionary
it
were
a
spear
thrust
quickly
for
thee
or
me
if
we
foolishly
meddled
with
the
private
matters
of
the
son
of
godwin
see
that
thou
let
the
youth
obey
his
earl
that
will
i
do
said
father
brian
but
it
evidently
went
hard
with
him
before
the
evening
of
thursday
some
results
of
the
peace
negotiations
had
been
made
public
and
they
appeared
to
be
all
that
the
army
ought
to
ask
for
the
city
of
york
was
to
be
surrendered
upon
the
following
monday
there
was
to
be
no
more
fighting
although
there
were
yet
a
number
of
minor
points
remaining
to
be
settled
fair
as
this
seemed
there
were
loud
murmurs
here
and
there
for
many
of
the
vikings
were
sorely
disappointed
they
declared
that
in
this
manner
they
were
being
unjustly
robbed
of
all
the
pleasure
upon
which
they
had
counted
in
the
taking
and
sacking
of
so
large
and
fine
a
town
they
are
as
mad
as
wet
hens
remarked
ned
because
they
are
not
to
have
the
fun
of
killing
the
people
i
guess
though
that
york
be
of
much
more
use
to
hardrada
and
tostig
after
all
these
pirates
had
gone
through
it
they
leave
it
worth
a
last
year
bird
nest
something
like
that
was
also
said
by
father
brian
and
all
the
while
the
prudent
priest
was
watching
his
opportunities
on
friday
morning
a
number
of
distinguished
english
clergymen
came
out
from
the
city
in
company
with
the
ambassadors
who
were
to
confer
with
hardrada
and
earl
tostig
when
these
learned
and
excellent
men
returned
to
york
the
irish
missionary
and
ned
the
son
of
webb
went
through
the
gate
with
them
my
boy
exclaimed
father
brian
as
they
did
so
here
we
are
safe
and
sound
i
sorry
thy
own
family
is
not
within
the
walls
but
thou
canst
do
the
bidding
of
thy
earl
easily
we
will
find
a
good
lodging
and
i
have
money
enough
for
us
both
i
found
it
in
the
pouches
of
some
of
the
unfortunate
heathen
that
lay
dead
on
the
fulford
field
they
will
not
need
it
any
more
and
it
is
a
very
timely
supply
for
thee
and
me
i
will
divide
fairly
the
coins
which
had
been
gathered
from
the
slain
at
fulford
were
mostly
of
copper
and
silver
and
were
not
very
well
shaped
with
these
were
several
pieces
of
gold
none
of
them
as
large
as
a
piece
not
any
greenbacks
remarked
ned
as
he
pocketed
his
share
money
goes
far
here
though
and
a
fellow
earning
a
dollar
a
day
is
a
mogul
in
england
in
these
times
father
brian
says
you
can
buy
a
horse
for
five
dollars
and
a
farm
for
fifty
these
coppers
are
as
big
as
saucepans
and
one
of
will
pay
for
a
night
lodging
at
the
best
york
hotel
if
he
might
otherwise
have
had
some
conscientious
scruples
concerning
the
source
of
this
supply
of
money
he
was
willing
to
leave
all
that
to
so
good
a
man
as
the
missionary
and
to
consider
the
cash
as
the
ordinary
spoils
of
war
i
could
give
it
back
to
its
old
owners
if
i
wanted
to
he
thought
war
is
war
anyhow
and
this
invasion
is
a
great
piece
of
piracy
from
beginning
to
end
i
am
a
kind
of
norse
viking
pirate
myself
now
that
he
was
really
inside
the
walls
of
the
city
of
york
he
considered
that
he
was
under
a
necessity
for
beginning
to
seem
if
not
also
to
feel
exceedingly
english
or
rather
thousands
of
angry
fugitives
from
the
fulford
fight
and
thousands
more
of
fresh
arrivals
from
the
interior
were
likely
to
be
roaming
around
the
streets
every
man
of
them
would
have
a
weapon
with
him
and
was
sure
to
have
revengeful
feelings
toward
either
a
favourite
of
tostig
or
a
young
viking
the
fact
is
thought
ned
i
a
kind
of
spy
and
they
shoot
spies
as
soon
as
they
catch
them
i
wo
do
them
any
harm
anyhow
there
was
nothing
in
his
dress
or
appearance
to
distinguish
him
for
his
helmet
and
his
mail
and
shield
were
as
like
as
two
peas
to
such
as
were
worn
or
carried
by
the
english
soldiery
all
the
hotels
will
be
crowded
he
said
to
father
brian
i
wonder
if
we
had
to
sleep
in
one
of
the
streets
no
we
will
not
replied
his
friend
i
have
a
direction
to
a
hostelry
it
is
a
place
of
entertainment
for
man
and
beast
that
is
attached
to
one
of
the
churches
it
is
likely
to
be
quiet
and
is
good
enough
if
a
man
can
get
nothing
better
any
kind
of
coop
will
do
for
me
said
ned
i
not
half
so
particular
about
that
as
i
am
about
getting
under
cover
i
want
to
see
all
there
is
of
this
town
too
that
is
thy
duty
said
the
missionary
and
thou
wilt
see
but
little
of
me
before
sunday
i
have
to
pay
my
respects
to
the
bishop
as
thou
knowest
ned
the
son
of
webb
did
not
really
know
anything
whatever
about
the
manner
in
which
things
were
managed
in
the
northumberland
churches
but
he
was
quite
willing
to
do
his
sightseeing
or
his
business
for
tostig
by
himself
his
friend
led
the
way
to
the
hostelry
and
left
him
there
and
as
yet
neither
of
them
had
been
spoken
to
by
anybody
well
remarked
ned
to
himself
shortly
afterward
sitting
by
a
small
table
with
very
good
mutton
chops
before
him
so
this
is
a
tavern
in
york
i
declare
when
i
came
through
the
front
door
of
it
i
thought
it
looked
more
like
a
jail
quiet
kind
of
place
where
ministers
come
like
father
brian
and
his
friends
those
fellows
at
the
other
table
are
awfully
quiet
only
i
do
understand
a
word
of
their
jangle
there
come
their
swords
it
a
fight
the
was
large
with
a
wooden
floor
and
tolerably
good
plain
furniture
the
plates
and
cups
were
clean
and
most
of
them
were
of
heavy
pewter
ware
even
napkins
of
linen
were
supplied
but
he
had
not
yet
seen
a
yard
of
cotton
goods
of
course
there
were
several
tables
and
around
one
of
these
had
been
sitting
half
a
dozen
men
none
was
in
mail
but
two
wore
steel
corselets
the
others
had
large
round
shields
or
targets
and
all
were
provided
with
swords
they
had
talked
loudly
rudely
from
the
moment
that
they
sat
down
and
it
seemed
that
they
were
angrily
discussing
the
battle
and
the
treaty
with
the
king
of
norway
louder
fiercer
grew
their
hot
dispute
until
one
of
them
struck
another
a
blow
with
his
fist
and
all
sprang
to
their
feet
every
man
drawing
his
sword
as
he
did
so
the
two
who
had
quarrelled
were
target
men
and
in
a
moment
more
there
was
a
ringing
of
steel
upon
blades
and
bucklers
nobody
made
any
attempt
at
interference
even
the
tavern
waiters
looking
on
almost
unexcitedly
as
if
at
a
common
incident
several
persons
lounged
in
from
other
rooms
and
the
faces
of
women
peered
through
open
doorways
why
do
they
call
for
the
police
exclaimed
ned
without
getting
up
they
ought
to
be
sent
to
the
i
finish
my
chops
anyhow
for
i
guess
i
safe
away
in
this
corner
of
the
room
his
keen
hunger
helped
his
wisdom
and
he
ate
very
fast
becoming
conscious
as
he
did
so
that
there
were
inquiring
eyes
aimed
at
him
both
of
the
combatants
were
evidently
experienced
swordsmen
and
as
yet
all
the
fight
had
been
mere
rattle
when
a
third
target
bearer
swaggered
over
toward
ned
saying
something
to
him
in
a
tongue
which
might
be
almost
any
kind
of
old
english
he
means
mischief
thought
ned
i
better
be
ready
for
him
i
let
him
stick
me
for
nothing
he
did
not
say
a
word
aloud
but
in
an
instant
he
was
on
his
feet
shield
on
arm
blade
in
hand
he
was
really
but
just
in
time
for
his
sudden
movement
had
been
taken
for
a
challenge
and
the
ruffian
struck
at
once
the
first
pair
paused
in
their
as
if
they
had
had
brawl
enough
or
rather
as
if
they
were
more
deeply
interested
in
this
unexpected
skirmish
with
an
entire
stranger
hullo
said
ned
loudly
as
they
came
closer
around
him
the
fellow
ca
fence
i
punched
him
through
the
sword
arm
as
if
he
had
been
made
of
putty
illustration
he
was
really
but
just
in
time
for
the
ruffian
struck
at
once
his
burly
antagonist
had
indeed
been
disabled
at
the
third
pass
for
he
had
been
accustomed
to
parry
almost
altogether
with
his
buckler
and
modern
science
was
against
him
he
dropped
his
heavy
broadsword
and
stared
at
ned
in
astonishment
while
all
the
clapped
their
hands
it
wo
do
to
talk
norway
here
thought
ned
i
just
bother
them
with
new
york
english
instead
of
anything
there
is
in
old
york
so
he
did
as
man
after
man
even
his
assailant
came
forward
to
compliment
him
on
his
prowess
he
might
have
felt
better
perhaps
if
he
had
understood
an
explanation
made
by
one
of
them
to
the
others
the
youth
cometh
from
cornwall
he
told
them
i
have
often
heard
their
speech
which
none
may
understand
he
belongeth
to
harold
the
earl
the
king
all
the
cornishmen
have
those
tricks
with
a
blade
he
hath
earned
his
peace
do
ye
all
let
him
alone
for
the
king
sake
ned
followed
with
some
severe
remarks
about
good
manners
to
strangers
the
police
court
and
the
state
prison
and
they
all
swaggered
out
of
the
tavern
declaring
that
they
had
had
good
sport
for
the
day
and
that
they
thought
well
of
king
harold
cornish
fighters
the
keeper
of
the
inn
came
to
have
a
look
at
ned
and
was
easily
made
to
understand
that
the
next
thing
required
by
the
cornish
gladiator
was
another
mutton
chop
somewhat
less
rare
if
possible
ned
added
request
for
a
cup
of
coffee
and
some
custard
pie
was
not
so
perfectly
comprehended
for
none
came
he
felt
a
great
deal
better
after
dinner
although
he
did
not
so
much
as
imagine
what
new
country
he
had
now
been
born
in
or
how
very
much
improved
was
his
social
position
so
far
as
that
hotel
was
concerned
he
was
duly
conducted
to
the
room
assigned
him
and
it
was
in
some
respects
the
best
he
had
had
since
leaving
the
united
states
of
america
it
was
indeed
as
he
declared
of
it
a
narrow
bit
of
crib
with
slits
in
the
wall
for
windows
but
he
was
pleased
to
find
that
it
contained
a
bowl
and
pitcher
of
water
and
a
couple
of
good
towels
even
the
bed
was
not
a
bunk
but
stood
upon
legs
and
had
a
straw
mattress
sheets
and
a
hair
pillow
this
was
luxury
it
more
than
i
ever
saw
in
norway
he
remarked
there
is
any
elevator
in
this
building
though
and
i
do
believe
there
is
a
box
of
blacking
in
england
i
hear
any
fellow
calling
after
me
to
let
him
shine
up
the
remainder
of
that
day
and
all
of
saturday
went
by
like
a
dream
so
busy
was
ned
with
his
spying
into
the
affairs
of
york
he
knew
that
he
was
in
one
of
the
old
historic
cities
of
england
here
had
been
a
town
of
the
ancient
britons
and
the
romans
when
they
conquered
them
had
made
a
prosperous
place
of
it
there
were
roman
walls
and
houses
yet
and
all
the
wider
streets
as
ned
said
of
them
kind
o
talked
latin
the
saxons
when
they
came
had
slaughtered
the
population
in
accordance
with
the
existing
laws
of
war
all
the
streets
of
their
making
with
some
that
were
older
were
narrow
as
well
as
dirty
they
are
dusty
enough
too
just
now
remarked
ned
i
guess
there
is
much
of
a
department
in
the
city
government
no
street
sprinkling
not
a
sidewalk
anywhere
nor
any
street
lamps
nor
telegraph
poles
every
fellow
plays
policeman
for
himself
if
he
of
the
kind
they
allow
to
wear
a
sword
he
carries
a
big
club
and
has
a
long
in
his
belt
about
these
days
all
the
women
seem
to
be
keeping
indoors
without
any
pianos
or
stationary
washtubs
or
he
saw
several
fine
churches
and
palaces
but
the
latter
and
all
of
the
larger
dwellings
were
like
so
many
private
forts
expecting
to
be
besieged
and
defended
sometime
or
other
this
is
a
queer
way
to
live
he
thought
with
a
war
around
you
all
the
while
i
looked
at
the
walls
too
they
stand
anything
but
artillery
i
guess
a
few
of
our
heavy
shells
would
send
all
that
stonework
flying
on
sunday
morning
father
brian
appeared
again
at
the
tavern
as
he
had
promised
to
do
he
seemed
in
good
spirits
but
he
wore
a
mysterious
air
as
if
he
were
prudently
concealing
something
he
inquired
with
friendly
interest
concerning
all
of
ned
explorations
around
york
my
boy
he
then
remarked
thou
wilt
be
able
to
make
a
good
report
to
tostig
the
earl
when
he
cometh
into
the
city
but
i
will
not
permit
thee
to
make
it
until
then
i
will
tell
thee
one
thing
more
if
it
will
keep
thee
quiet
the
saxon
guards
at
the
derwent
side
gates
would
split
thy
head
for
thee
if
thou
shouldst
attempt
to
go
out
of
the
trap
that
hath
been
set
for
hardrada
i
do
mean
to
be
split
replied
ned
but
what
is
the
trap
hardrada
army
is
to
march
in
before
sunset
i
can
see
the
earl
then
if
he
getteth
in
my
boy
laughed
the
knowing
missionary
that
is
the
trap
keep
thy
mouth
shut
and
save
thy
head
from
a
they
would
cleave
thee
to
the
jaws
for
a
word
edwin
and
morcar
have
saved
all
the
time
that
was
needed
for
their
plan
to
work
they
were
to
give
king
hardrada
a
hundred
and
fifty
important
men
for
hostages
and
not
a
soul
of
them
will
ever
need
to
leave
his
house
the
norway
army
will
begin
monday
with
eating
and
drinking
and
getting
ready
to
put
a
garrison
into
york
but
when
they
come
to
try
that
they
will
find
out
what
the
trap
is
dost
thou
know
it
asked
ned
i
am
not
a
blind
one
replied
the
man
from
ireland
when
i
saw
edwin
and
morcar
skirmishing
for
every
hour
of
time
i
hardly
needed
to
be
told
the
rest
of
it
mark
thou
this
my
boy
for
thy
life
thou
and
i
belong
to
harold
the
earl
the
king
of
england
unless
thou
shalt
see
the
raven
flags
of
hardrada
inside
the
walls
of
york
it
will
be
long
before
thou
doest
that
i
think
the
king
of
norway
was
apparently
in
no
doubt
whatever
concerning
the
entire
good
faith
of
the
two
english
earls
he
considered
them
already
his
own
subjects
many
of
the
great
men
of
northumberland
had
held
a
mass
convention
and
had
voted
to
accept
him
as
their
ruler
everything
was
working
well
therefore
and
he
felt
sure
that
his
new
kingdom
had
been
at
least
half
won
for
him
by
his
great
victory
at
fulford
nevertheless
according
to
agreement
saxon
warriors
were
as
yet
keeping
stern
guard
at
all
the
gates
of
york
i
saw
them
said
ned
to
himself
i
wo
run
against
their
spears
either
one
of
would
go
right
through
me
i
find
just
a
little
more
though
and
then
i
get
out
if
i
have
to
climb
over
the
walls
i
do
see
any
trap
if
father
brian
does
but
if
there
is
one
going
to
warn
tostig
i
wonder
if
he
suspects
anything
maybe
the
reason
why
he
sent
me
in
without
ever
having
been
sworn
in
as
he
called
it
for
a
regular
soldier
of
the
king
of
norway
he
considered
himself
a
part
of
the
invading
army
and
he
meant
to
do
his
duty
by
his
general
so
far
as
he
could
this
was
therefore
a
time
of
intense
excitement
for
him
as
well
as
for
others
and
when
monday
morning
came
he
and
his
reverend
friend
were
up
and
out
early
come
on
my
boy
said
father
brian
if
thou
wilt
go
with
me
to
the
other
side
of
the
city
where
the
bridge
over
the
ouse
letteth
in
the
southern
highway
through
the
wall
gate
i
may
be
able
to
show
thee
that
which
it
would
be
worth
the
while
of
tostig
thine
earl
to
know
that
what
i
want
exclaimed
ned
i
get
it
to
him
somehow
we
take
the
there
he
stopped
short
for
his
friend
was
striding
away
ned
followed
him
and
he
was
beginning
to
be
aware
of
a
new
and
strange
idea
which
made
him
tingle
all
over
he
felt
desperate
warlike
and
he
changed
his
shield
from
over
his
shoulder
to
its
upon
his
left
arm
while
he
gripped
his
spear
tightly
as
if
he
expected
to
use
it
perhaps
it
was
his
appearance
of
angry
excitement
which
got
him
into
his
next
bad
scrape
for
other
men
also
were
in
a
dangerous
state
of
mind
the
ouse
gate
had
been
almost
reached
and
father
brian
was
several
paces
in
advance
just
here
however
at
a
sharp
turn
of
the
winding
street
they
came
unexpectedly
upon
a
furious
mob
of
the
lowest
kind
of
danes
and
angles
they
were
club
and
knife
men
of
course
wearing
no
armour
they
were
nothing
more
than
so
many
fierce
wild
ignorant
and
cruel
savages
upon
him
upon
him
they
yelled
at
once
in
their
own
dialect
he
looketh
like
a
norwegian
down
with
him
club
him
to
the
death
that
they
might
have
done
quickly
but
for
ned
helmet
and
shield
and
the
lively
use
he
made
of
his
spear
they
were
many
however
and
it
was
well
for
him
that
he
could
back
against
a
house
wall
so
that
they
could
not
get
behind
him
this
is
awful
he
exclaimed
i
guess
i
done
for
i
prodded
that
fellow
i
wish
i
had
lars
here
and
a
dozen
vikings
or
sikend
the
berserker
they
were
far
away
indeed
but
at
that
moment
he
heard
a
ringing
irish
then
as
he
desperately
plied
his
spear
and
shielded
his
head
from
clubs
as
best
he
might
he
saw
the
of
father
brian
flashing
swiftly
murderously
upon
the
shaggy
crowns
and
shoulders
of
his
brutal
barbarous
assailants
down
they
were
going
like
so
many
human
ninepins
when
a
great
tumultuous
shouting
arose
in
the
direction
of
the
gate
ned
did
not
get
its
meaning
but
all
the
ruffians
who
were
still
upon
their
feet
shouted
as
if
in
reply
to
it
and
sprang
away
thou
hast
fought
well
my
boy
said
the
missionary
art
thou
hurt
i
banged
pretty
well
said
ned
but
what
is
all
that
shouting
come
thou
along
in
haste
said
his
friend
i
will
show
thee
what
it
is
the
city
of
york
will
close
no
gate
against
the
man
that
is
coming
now
he
bringeth
woe
to
all
the
host
of
hardrada
and
i
think
thou
wilt
deliver
no
report
to
tostig
the
earl
this
day
on
on
to
the
gate
if
it
is
anything
worth
while
i
see
that
the
earl
gets
it
replied
ned
but
my
shield
hath
had
all
the
style
clubbed
out
of
it
oh
how
my
arm
aches
and
my
head
chapter
xi
the
battle
of
stamford
bridge
look
thou
yonder
look
o
ned
the
son
of
webb
exclaimed
father
brian
banners
responded
ned
almost
breathlessly
horsemen
who
can
they
be
is
it
the
army
of
harold
the
king
of
england
tostig
and
hardrada
think
he
is
away
at
the
southern
shore
watching
for
duke
william
of
normandy
why
he
can
march
right
on
into
the
city
he
will
do
more
than
that
replied
the
irishman
with
a
very
knowing
look
my
boy
mark
thou
well
now
not
a
horn
nor
a
trumpet
soundeth
among
yonder
horsemen
and
they
ride
rapidly
stand
still
here
and
keep
thine
eyes
open
we
are
safe
at
this
place
then
will
we
go
on
with
them
and
i
think
we
shall
see
the
springing
of
the
great
trap
of
harold
with
which
he
hath
caught
the
vikings
i
ought
to
go
ahead
at
once
and
warn
tostig
the
earl
said
ned
if
thou
in
thy
armour
art
able
to
go
faster
than
will
the
horsemen
of
the
king
of
england
half
laughed
the
missionary
thou
mayst
be
sure
also
that
thousands
of
swords
are
on
guard
along
the
walls
watching
well
that
no
man
shall
get
out
on
the
derwent
side
to
carry
news
of
this
thing
i
get
the
news
correctly
first
and
then
i
see
what
i
can
do
with
it
said
ned
stubbornly
but
he
instantly
became
absorbed
by
his
inspection
of
the
arriving
host
of
the
saxon
king
right
onward
rode
fast
its
vanguard
of
mounted
men
and
ned
quickly
perceived
that
these
were
unlike
anything
that
he
had
seen
before
their
arms
and
armour
were
so
nearly
of
a
pattern
that
it
was
as
if
they
were
in
steel
uniform
their
horses
were
large
and
strong
and
there
was
no
disorder
to
be
seen
in
their
trained
and
disciplined
movements
minutes
passed
by
and
then
he
heard
a
man
who
stood
near
him
exclaim
loudly
yea
my
friend
these
are
the
thingmen
they
are
the
of
the
king
there
are
no
other
men
like
them
they
are
the
picked
of
all
england
already
ned
had
heard
a
great
deal
about
these
fighters
first
among
the
kings
of
england
it
was
said
harold
had
organised
and
maintained
a
considerable
standing
army
selecting
for
it
the
best
men
he
could
find
and
making
them
personally
devoted
to
himself
none
of
hardrada
troops
march
as
these
do
thought
ned
as
a
column
of
on
foot
followed
the
foremost
detachment
of
cavalry
our
best
city
regiments
ca
beat
it
none
of
our
militia
would
care
to
carry
so
much
iron
though
not
in
hot
weather
what
tremendously
big
fellows
they
are
hullo
there
comes
the
king
hurrah
i
always
wanted
to
see
harold
is
he
splendid
he
is
as
tall
as
hardrada
of
norway
he
a
giant
his
sudden
explosion
of
enthusiasm
was
joined
in
by
all
around
and
it
won
for
him
many
kindly
looks
and
sayings
for
the
people
of
york
were
going
wild
with
joy
at
their
unexpected
deliverance
from
the
vikings
and
from
the
cruel
revenges
of
earl
tostig
they
could
hardly
believe
their
ears
and
eyes
that
this
was
indeed
their
hero
monarch
splendid
indeed
was
harold
the
son
of
godwin
riding
bareheaded
into
the
city
which
might
be
called
one
of
the
two
capitals
of
his
kingdom
london
was
the
other
capital
and
in
many
respects
it
was
the
more
important
but
all
the
north
of
the
kingdom
was
to
be
ruled
in
a
manner
from
york
the
handsome
thoughtful
face
of
harold
was
somewhat
pallid
from
recent
illness
but
he
seemed
to
ned
the
son
of
webb
one
of
the
most
powerfully
built
men
that
he
had
ever
seen
even
in
norway
they
say
he
was
thinking
that
not
many
men
living
can
stand
before
him
in
single
fight
i
should
wonder
if
my
conquest
of
england
is
going
to
be
cracked
to
pieces
right
away
if
that
so
i
going
to
be
one
of
harold
men
and
fight
duke
william
harold
is
a
better
man
than
tostig
but
what
on
earth
am
i
going
to
do
about
lars
and
vebba
he
was
afraid
that
father
brian
was
right
and
that
he
had
now
no
chance
for
returning
to
them
or
to
the
earl
and
a
strange
wave
of
new
feeling
was
sweeping
through
him
he
did
not
now
wish
to
fight
these
englishmen
who
were
defending
their
country
and
a
great
admiration
for
harold
the
hero
was
taking
possession
of
him
great
men
often
seem
to
have
a
magnetic
power
for
drawing
all
other
men
to
them
and
the
last
of
the
saxon
kings
was
a
very
strong
magnet
at
his
side
now
rode
his
brother
leofwine
not
so
tall
but
reputed
to
be
almost
as
good
a
warrior
on
behind
them
poured
steadily
the
long
columns
of
the
saxon
army
not
by
any
means
all
of
its
forces
however
were
as
thoroughly
disciplined
and
equipped
as
were
the
of
the
king
i
think
thou
canst
now
understand
this
matter
my
boy
remarked
father
brian
thou
seest
with
thine
own
eyes
that
all
things
were
ready
for
their
coming
and
that
they
march
through
the
city
without
halting
for
a
moment
none
will
hinder
their
going
out
at
the
derwent
gate
and
not
a
man
beyond
the
wall
on
that
side
knoweth
of
their
coming
this
will
be
a
bad
day
for
all
of
hardrada
men
that
are
on
this
side
of
the
derwent
they
will
be
surprised
and
outnumbered
and
small
mercy
will
be
shown
to
them
come
on
exclaimed
ned
i
want
to
get
there
i
may
do
something
yet
around
by
other
streets
necessarily
much
more
slowly
than
the
mounted
men
the
two
friends
made
their
way
across
the
city
when
at
last
they
reached
the
derwent
gate
however
there
was
nothing
to
prevent
their
marching
out
at
once
with
the
of
king
harold
father
brian
inquired
ned
dost
thou
suppose
that
edwin
and
morcar
knew
of
this
all
the
while
they
did
he
responded
a
swift
messenger
came
to
tell
them
how
much
time
they
must
save
in
their
bargainings
he
was
a
saxon
priest
and
no
man
suspected
his
errand
push
on
now
some
of
hardrada
troops
were
expecting
to
march
in
and
garrison
the
city
at
this
hour
then
the
king
of
norway
and
earl
tostig
were
to
hold
a
court
here
and
give
a
great
feast
very
little
more
good
eating
are
they
likely
to
do
this
day
the
saxon
army
pressed
forward
steadily
and
its
several
divisions
were
evidently
under
clear
instructions
for
as
they
marched
they
spread
out
on
the
right
and
left
into
a
compact
with
a
broad
front
the
centre
of
which
consisted
of
the
hardly
had
the
foremost
lines
advanced
from
the
city
walls
to
the
river
derwent
when
they
were
suddenly
confronted
by
the
strong
body
of
vikings
which
had
been
sent
to
take
possession
of
york
in
accordance
with
the
terms
of
surrender
it
was
swinging
along
fearlessly
joyously
without
any
thought
of
meeting
a
hostile
force
ned
the
son
of
webb
and
his
companion
had
walked
their
very
best
to
keep
with
the
advance
and
they
were
now
away
at
the
right
of
the
saxon
army
front
for
there
was
no
possibility
of
getting
through
it
hark
suddenly
exclaimed
father
brian
the
trumpets
of
the
they
are
sounding
the
charge
hearest
thou
not
also
that
braying
of
viking
forward
over
this
ridge
my
boy
thou
and
i
are
to
see
something
now
there
they
go
shouted
ned
the
whole
line
is
making
a
rush
quick
i
want
to
see
that
charge
i
wish
i
knew
where
lars
is
i
hope
beyond
the
river
they
were
only
just
in
time
to
see
the
warriors
of
norway
had
no
time
at
all
given
them
to
form
in
order
of
battle
the
narrow
front
of
their
astonished
column
was
instantly
shattered
by
the
charge
of
the
mounted
behind
these
closing
around
upon
their
flanks
clashed
forward
the
saxon
footmen
with
ax
and
spear
hardrada
men
were
veterans
and
they
fell
back
fighting
furiously
and
struggling
to
keep
their
ranks
all
things
were
against
them
however
the
surprise
the
superior
numbers
and
the
flanking
encircling
tactics
of
king
harold
men
look
said
father
brian
all
this
part
of
them
are
in
the
trap
all
that
are
behind
are
turning
toward
the
bridge
only
such
as
reach
it
while
these
are
fighting
will
ever
get
away
the
rest
must
die
it
as
awful
as
the
fulford
fight
said
ned
hardrada
lost
men
enough
there
and
now
another
large
slice
of
his
army
is
gone
he
will
have
to
give
up
the
idea
of
conquering
england
he
lost
that
at
fulford
said
the
missionary
and
he
threw
away
all
that
was
left
him
when
he
let
the
earls
cheat
him
into
waiting
for
harold
the
slaughter
now
going
on
was
pitiless
much
the
larger
part
of
hardrada
remaining
strength
nevertheless
was
still
upon
the
other
side
of
the
derwent
and
considerable
numbers
were
escaping
across
the
bridge
to
join
it
it
is
our
time
to
go
ahead
my
boy
said
father
brian
we
must
get
to
the
bank
of
the
river
if
we
can
i
want
to
see
how
the
saxons
will
manage
to
cross
the
bridge
hardrada
can
easily
hold
it
against
them
we
ca
cross
it
ourselves
replied
ned
so
far
as
i
can
see
we
must
stay
with
the
english
army
whether
we
like
it
or
not
thou
hast
no
errand
now
for
tostig
the
earl
growled
the
missionary
he
hath
no
more
need
for
anything
that
thou
couldst
tell
him
ho
boats
two
of
them
one
will
do
for
us
and
that
is
what
i
was
looking
for
we
need
no
bridge
there
a
fellow
getting
into
one
of
them
said
ned
we
take
the
other
down
they
went
and
in
a
minute
more
they
were
pulling
away
over
the
derwent
taking
little
notice
of
the
occupant
of
the
other
boat
except
to
see
that
he
was
a
heavily
armoured
spearman
of
the
their
eyes
were
too
busy
to
care
for
him
for
they
were
watching
the
rush
of
the
fugitives
across
the
bridge
for
life
for
life
they
were
crowding
along
the
narrow
passage
which
was
their
only
escape
from
the
steel
of
the
saxons
it
was
beginning
to
look
as
if
all
who
could
escape
were
already
over
when
ned
the
son
of
webb
almost
yelled
out
sikend
sikend
the
berserker
look
at
him
he
is
holding
the
bridge
all
alone
row
on
i
want
to
get
nearer
a
few
strokes
of
the
oars
carried
them
upstream
to
within
fifty
yards
of
the
spot
where
the
berserker
stood
clad
still
in
full
armour
his
tremendous
form
seeming
broader
and
more
powerful
than
ever
mad
with
all
the
battle
fury
of
his
race
and
nature
ax
in
hand
and
shield
on
arm
he
defied
the
rush
of
his
antagonists
with
a
prowess
that
appeared
to
be
more
than
human
loudly
and
mockingly
laughed
the
fierce
champion
of
norway
as
he
caught
spear
after
spear
and
arrow
after
arrow
upon
his
broad
bright
shield
louder
yet
was
his
shout
of
vindictive
triumph
as
his
resistless
ax
cleft
helmet
after
helmet
and
shoulder
after
shoulder
there
he
must
die
and
this
he
knew
right
well
but
his
was
to
be
no
cow
death
little
did
he
care
for
its
coming
so
that
he
might
slay
many
foemen
and
fall
surrounded
by
their
dead
bodies
brave
as
they
were
the
saxons
fell
back
for
a
moment
from
before
this
awful
shape
it
had
happened
that
the
first
of
them
to
cross
the
bridge
were
not
of
the
thingmen
of
harold
these
were
still
busily
destroying
the
remainder
of
the
vikings
on
the
york
side
of
the
river
again
a
rush
was
made
and
again
sikend
drove
it
back
it
was
afterward
said
that
not
less
than
forty
warriors
fell
dead
under
the
terrible
blows
of
the
berserker
yonder
is
king
harold
on
the
bank
said
ned
the
son
of
webb
but
look
at
that
saxon
in
the
boat
under
the
bridge
he
is
after
sikend
he
is
stabbing
upward
with
his
spear
through
the
cracks
between
the
planks
they
ca
be
wide
enough
said
father
brian
ha
sikend
is
hurt
he
is
down
upon
one
knee
he
can
stand
and
fight
no
longer
i
stop
that
man
shouted
ned
pulling
hard
upon
his
oars
sikend
is
a
friend
of
mine
let
thou
alone
exclaimed
father
brian
it
is
no
affair
of
thine
he
was
too
late
for
ned
had
now
arisen
in
his
sudden
excitement
and
his
angry
yell
had
drawn
upon
him
the
attention
of
the
louder
was
the
response
of
the
tall
saxon
and
as
he
shouted
he
hurled
at
ned
the
long
javelin
with
which
he
had
smitten
the
berserker
thou
hast
it
gasped
the
missionary
on
my
shield
said
ned
it
went
through
it
as
if
it
had
been
cardboard
but
my
mail
stopped
it
there
he
is
over
i
need
not
spear
him
praise
the
saints
muttered
father
brian
he
hath
upset
but
for
me
thou
wouldst
have
done
the
same
that
was
not
strictly
correct
the
saxon
boat
was
floating
well
but
the
very
energy
of
his
furiously
angry
had
tipped
his
tiny
punt
and
sent
it
out
from
under
him
plunging
him
into
the
swiftly
eddying
current
of
the
derwent
can
he
swim
whispered
ned
with
all
his
armour
on
that
is
the
last
of
him
remarked
father
brian
he
will
throw
no
more
javelins
he
is
gone
not
even
once
did
the
overweighted
come
to
the
surface
he
may
indeed
have
been
no
swimmer
in
the
meantime
however
with
wild
hurrahs
the
saxons
on
the
bridge
had
charged
forward
and
thrust
after
thrust
had
been
given
to
the
prostrate
body
of
the
wounded
berserker
he
had
fallen
as
he
had
wished
to
fall
a
hero
defying
a
whole
army
king
harold
men
are
pushing
across
the
bridge
said
ned
as
his
boat
drifted
out
from
under
it
why
on
earth
did
the
vikings
leave
it
to
be
defended
by
one
man
it
is
only
one
more
of
hardrada
blunders
replied
the
missionary
he
is
only
a
sea
king
and
not
a
good
general
on
the
land
a
man
may
be
the
biggest
pirate
in
all
the
world
and
not
know
enough
to
handle
an
army
he
hath
done
little
more
than
to
fight
hard
and
to
blunder
all
the
while
ever
since
he
landed
seest
thou
now
the
mounted
gallop
forward
behind
them
the
saxon
army
will
form
on
the
other
bank
and
then
hardrada
army
is
doomed
thou
and
i
will
cross
quickly
that
we
may
obtain
a
good
place
from
which
to
watch
the
shutting
of
this
the
vikings
that
are
left
will
be
awfully
outnumbered
said
ned
oh
how
i
wish
i
could
do
something
for
lars
and
vebba
and
our
men
the
invading
host
hath
no
hope
said
his
friend
they
are
to
be
struck
by
one
of
the
best
generals
in
the
world
leading
the
best
fighters
thou
canst
do
nothing
at
all
for
thy
friends
it
too
bad
groaned
ned
i
like
lars
the
boat
was
soon
left
behind
them
not
a
great
while
afterward
they
were
standing
upon
a
moderate
elevation
of
rocky
ground
at
the
right
of
the
level
upon
which
the
saxon
forces
were
rapidly
forming
in
order
of
battle
under
the
eyes
of
their
king
they
were
doing
so
at
this
precise
place
for
the
reason
that
immediately
in
front
of
them
were
assembled
all
that
was
now
left
of
the
forces
of
king
hardrada
my
boy
exclaimed
the
missionary
both
sides
are
looking
splendidly
i
am
glad
to
be
where
i
can
see
but
any
man
running
in
between
those
two
fronts
would
be
like
a
corn
of
wheat
between
millstones
see
thou
all
of
the
are
dismounting
they
will
fight
on
foot
they
do
not
mean
to
lose
too
many
horses
i
would
not
if
i
were
they
with
mayhap
a
long
ride
near
to
come
william
of
normandy
horses
wear
armour
said
ned
i
have
seen
pictures
of
them
as
much
armour
as
a
man
weareth
not
many
of
them
replied
father
brian
here
and
there
one
perhaps
if
the
owner
of
the
horse
can
afford
that
kind
of
harness
not
many
can
for
armour
costeth
money
the
man
that
made
the
pictures
may
have
had
some
of
that
armour
in
his
head
thou
meanest
in
his
eye
said
ned
there
were
loads
of
it
anyhow
and
if
a
horse
loaded
like
that
were
to
stumble
and
fall
he
be
likely
to
stay
down
any
man
that
goeth
down
will
stay
down
responded
the
missionary
the
northumberland
levies
that
follow
in
the
rear
have
come
to
take
revenge
for
the
slaughter
at
fulford
it
is
a
cruel
heathenish
business
from
first
to
last
i
will
be
glad
when
the
whole
world
shall
be
civilised
as
it
is
around
clontarf
the
great
invasion
of
england
by
the
sea
king
was
already
a
complete
failure
he
and
his
brave
but
now
dispirited
vikings
had
rallied
to
make
their
last
stand
against
the
unexpected
and
now
overwhelming
host
of
the
hero
king
of
england
upon
that
very
day
hardrada
of
norway
and
tostig
the
earl
were
to
have
entered
york
as
conquerors
here
they
were
instead
at
a
little
after
midday
confronting
sure
ruin
and
probable
death
all
the
remaining
fighting
strength
of
york
and
its
vicinity
had
zealously
joined
king
harold
so
that
all
the
while
the
stamford
bridge
was
still
thronged
with
marching
men
the
marvel
that
tostig
or
hardrada
had
not
ordered
it
to
be
burnt
or
chopped
away
was
on
the
tongues
of
many
they
may
have
vainly
thought
of
again
using
it
to
recross
the
derwent
and
if
so
this
was
one
more
bad
blunder
for
they
had
left
it
in
the
hands
of
king
harold
and
he
was
a
general
the
army
front
presented
by
the
northmen
was
exceedingly
dangerous
looking
nevertheless
they
had
formed
in
close
order
with
the
raven
standard
the
land
waster
near
the
centre
in
front
of
this
at
first
were
the
sea
king
himself
and
tostig
the
earl
but
their
duty
as
leaders
shortly
called
upon
them
to
ride
to
and
fro
among
their
followers
uttering
loud
sounding
words
of
encouragement
and
hope
norwegians
were
very
brave
men
and
they
responded
with
loud
shouts
and
the
braying
of
thousands
of
while
every
harp
among
them
sounded
there
was
yet
a
wide
open
space
between
the
two
army
fronts
into
this
rode
out
from
that
of
the
northmen
a
herald
sounding
a
parley
the
agreement
for
one
being
made
at
once
from
the
same
side
rode
out
tostig
the
earl
accompanied
by
vikings
of
rank
and
he
was
met
about
by
a
similar
party
of
saxons
what
terms
asked
tostig
will
harold
of
england
offer
if
harold
hardrada
and
tostig
the
son
of
godwin
will
now
make
peace
with
him
what
will
he
offer
to
the
earl
and
what
part
of
england
will
he
surrender
to
the
king
of
norway
a
loud
ringing
voice
from
among
the
saxon
horsemen
at
once
responded
to
tostig
the
son
of
godwin
full
pardon
and
an
earldom
to
harold
hardrada
of
norway
seven
feet
of
english
ground
for
his
burial
or
since
he
is
said
to
be
taller
than
other
men
he
will
be
allowed
twelve
inches
more
then
tell
thou
him
replied
the
earl
that
tostig
will
not
desert
the
comrades
who
have
trusted
him
and
that
he
will
fight
to
the
last
back
rode
both
of
the
embassies
to
their
own
friends
and
hardrada
who
had
heard
all
of
the
loudly
uttered
questions
and
answers
exclaimed
to
tostig
good
was
thy
speech
my
friend
but
who
was
the
man
who
heard
and
answered
thee
he
was
harold
the
son
of
godwin
replied
the
earl
what
shouted
the
angry
king
then
he
should
never
have
gotten
back
in
safety
to
his
own
not
so
said
tostig
sadly
i
have
erred
much
but
my
royal
brother
i
might
not
betray
to
thee
and
thine
other
things
were
said
on
both
sides
but
none
of
them
was
heard
by
ned
the
son
of
webb
it
was
indeed
no
time
for
any
quarrel
between
tostig
and
hardrada
for
the
were
sounding
and
the
saxons
were
advancing
along
their
whole
line
firmly
steadily
with
desperate
courage
and
magnificent
prowess
they
were
met
by
the
close
array
of
the
northmen
although
these
were
not
so
well
disciplined
and
were
inferior
in
numbers
they
were
individually
equally
skilled
in
arms
and
they
were
fighting
for
their
lives
they
fought
on
with
almost
an
appearance
of
possible
success
until
the
resistless
pressure
of
the
trained
thingmen
broke
their
front
and
disordered
them
even
then
they
would
not
yield
and
all
who
afterward
told
stories
of
the
battle
had
wonderful
things
to
relate
concerning
the
feats
of
arms
performed
by
the
sea
king
himself
and
by
tostig
the
earl
and
by
many
of
the
heroes
of
the
vikings
under
the
land
waster
standard
at
last
an
arrow
slew
the
king
of
norway
there
also
fighting
valiantly
fell
tostig
the
earl
and
with
their
slaying
the
battle
ended
for
the
remaining
northmen
lost
heart
and
fled
then
to
the
surprise
of
some
harold
the
king
forbade
further
following
and
commanded
that
his
forces
should
once
more
come
into
close
order
it
may
be
that
he
was
not
quite
assured
as
to
how
many
vikings
might
yet
remain
at
the
shore
or
on
the
ships
at
all
events
there
were
excellent
reasons
why
he
should
be
willing
to
waste
neither
men
nor
time
at
that
place
and
why
he
should
offer
generous
terms
to
the
remnant
of
the
invaders
that
he
intended
doing
this
was
to
be
made
known
somewhat
later
and
now
he
sat
upon
his
horse
not
far
from
the
raven
standard
giving
directions
concerning
the
bodies
of
his
brother
tostig
and
of
king
hardrada
ned
the
son
of
webb
was
not
a
great
many
yards
away
for
he
and
the
missionary
had
followed
the
charge
of
the
saxons
and
had
been
almost
in
the
front
of
the
battle
he
was
now
staring
around
him
at
the
gory
evidences
of
how
hard
the
fight
had
been
almost
at
his
feet
lay
a
heap
of
slain
norwegians
and
from
under
one
edge
of
it
somebody
appeared
to
be
struggling
out
lars
the
son
of
vebba
shouted
ned
come
here
father
brian
thou
and
i
must
save
him
get
up
lars
no
man
will
harm
him
now
shouted
back
the
priest
is
he
badly
wounded
i
have
not
a
cut
responded
lars
himself
i
was
knocked
down
by
a
mace
that
is
all
and
these
others
fell
upon
me
o
ned
the
son
of
webb
we
are
ruined
ruined
there
will
be
sad
mourning
among
the
fiords
of
norway
vebba
exclaimed
ned
where
is
he
i
saw
him
escape
to
the
ships
among
the
first
replied
lars
almost
weeping
go
thou
after
him
thyself
said
ned
harold
the
king
hath
commanded
that
all
like
thee
may
go
tell
vebba
that
i
am
to
stay
here
run
if
thou
canst
get
on
board
a
ship
thou
art
right
to
stay
said
lars
this
is
thine
own
country
thou
hast
lost
thine
earl
tostig
but
mind
not
that
too
much
there
are
always
plenty
of
earls
said
ned
and
in
a
moment
more
lars
was
walking
away
briskly
he
was
safe
from
spear
or
blade
for
the
commands
of
harold
the
king
would
surely
be
obeyed
by
all
his
men
chapter
xii
a
ride
in
old
england
ned
the
son
of
webb
stood
still
gazing
very
earnestly
at
the
king
of
england
i
suppose
he
feels
badly
about
his
brother
ned
was
thinking
i
would
no
matter
what
he
been
up
to
i
sorry
tostig
was
killed
anyhow
he
was
a
friend
of
mine
i
did
see
king
harold
do
any
hand
to
hand
fighting
either
i
guess
he
kept
back
on
purpose
my
boy
sharply
whispered
father
brian
the
king
wheeleth
his
horse
toward
thee
stand
thou
still
for
he
hath
his
eye
upon
thee
in
a
moment
more
the
hot
blood
was
flushing
ned
cheeks
to
redness
for
the
king
drew
rein
in
front
of
him
and
spoke
in
saxon
if
ned
could
have
understood
him
he
might
have
been
astonished
for
he
was
saying
i
saw
thee
row
under
the
bridge
o
boy
with
a
battered
shield
thou
art
the
cunning
spearman
that
slew
for
me
the
berserker
and
opened
the
way
for
the
advance
i
thank
thee
whoever
thou
art
thou
art
but
young
too
for
such
a
doing
what
is
thy
name
ned
more
than
half
guessed
that
such
a
question
was
asked
him
and
he
promptly
responded
in
latin
i
am
ned
the
son
of
webb
o
king
aha
thou
speakest
latin
exclaimed
the
king
thou
seemest
to
be
well
born
and
thou
art
a
scholar
what
can
i
do
for
thee
speak
quickly
o
harold
the
king
said
ned
i
would
that
i
might
ride
with
the
army
when
it
marcheth
away
from
york
william
the
norman
is
coming
i
wish
to
be
with
thy
and
fight
the
normans
for
thee
and
for
england
he
felt
that
he
had
made
a
tremendously
long
speech
and
he
had
but
a
bright
smile
shot
across
the
face
of
the
king
that
thou
shalt
have
he
said
and
he
added
to
a
horseman
near
him
wolfram
of
hythe
get
good
horses
for
this
youth
and
for
his
teacher
that
attendeth
him
o
priest
remain
thou
with
thy
pupil
go
both
of
you
now
to
york
ned
the
son
of
webb
i
will
see
thee
again
i
will
be
with
him
o
king
replied
father
brian
loudly
he
is
a
youth
of
much
promise
and
he
needeth
my
continual
instruction
king
harold
spurred
away
followed
by
his
chiefs
and
thanes
and
earls
while
the
good
missionary
turned
almost
indignantly
upon
ned
this
is
wrong
he
exclaimed
thou
art
deceiving
the
king
i
did
not
understand
at
first
but
i
heard
others
of
them
repeat
his
words
he
believeth
thee
the
slayer
of
sikend
the
berserker
from
under
the
bridge
thou
art
not
was
that
it
almost
gasped
ned
i
never
said
i
was
i
think
it
was
a
mean
thing
to
do
anyhow
to
stab
sikend
in
the
legs
in
that
way
so
he
could
stand
up
and
fight
i
sorry
the
king
should
think
i
would
do
anything
so
unfair
as
that
so
am
i
said
father
brian
for
a
lie
is
a
bad
thing
any
day
thou
must
yet
find
an
opportunity
to
tell
him
the
truth
of
that
matter
but
i
am
glad
nevertheless
that
we
are
to
have
horses
and
get
away
from
york
in
good
company
i
have
a
great
desire
to
get
speedily
to
london
whatever
may
happen
afterward
wolfram
of
hythe
did
not
have
far
to
go
for
his
horses
and
those
which
he
was
now
bringing
forward
were
big
enough
for
they
had
a
somewhat
jaded
appearance
for
they
had
travelled
far
that
day
they
had
lost
their
riders
in
the
battle
it
was
explained
and
in
a
moment
more
ned
and
the
missionary
were
as
well
mounted
as
if
they
both
were
of
the
king
it
is
well
for
us
indeed
said
father
brian
we
shall
have
good
quarters
and
rations
too
while
we
are
on
the
march
thou
wilt
set
the
king
right
concerning
sikend
in
due
season
for
truth
sake
thou
didst
not
harm
thy
fellow
soldier
and
yet
i
tell
thee
that
the
world
can
not
be
civilised
until
there
are
no
more
berserkers
small
matter
it
is
how
they
are
killed
i
did
even
hurt
the
saxon
that
did
kill
him
said
ned
he
was
drowned
i
am
glad
of
that
almost
replied
father
brian
it
will
be
better
for
thee
to
make
thine
own
explanation
than
for
that
to
come
and
tell
the
king
thou
art
a
false
witness
it
awful
said
ned
i
a
fraud
it
is
any
fault
of
mine
though
and
i
can
straighten
it
as
soon
as
i
a
chance
the
shadows
of
evening
were
deepening
when
the
two
friends
rode
over
stamford
bridge
and
galloped
on
toward
york
when
they
reached
the
city
it
was
almost
dark
and
in
all
directions
hundreds
of
men
were
going
about
with
torches
and
rude
lanterns
the
panes
of
glass
in
those
lanterns
said
ned
to
himself
are
all
made
of
cow
horn
scraped
thin
i
guess
they
do
break
easily
they
are
better
than
nothing
though
and
we
can
find
our
way
to
the
tavern
so
they
did
and
once
more
ned
had
something
to
say
about
lights
there
an
awful
difference
he
remarked
between
these
smokers
and
electric
bulbs
or
gas
or
even
kerosene
or
candles
hollow
rushes
with
fat
poured
into
them
they
stand
up
pretty
well
in
the
sticks
but
they
do
last
long
and
how
they
do
smoke
he
did
not
allow
his
own
to
burn
down
however
as
soon
as
the
horses
were
cared
for
and
supper
was
eaten
he
was
glad
enough
to
get
into
bed
i
do
believe
there
is
nothing
else
in
all
the
world
he
said
that
will
tire
a
fellow
out
like
a
great
battle
father
brian
was
right
though
about
the
trap
that
was
set
for
king
hardrada
those
two
english
earls
edwin
and
morcar
knew
well
enough
that
harold
was
coming
and
they
had
everything
ready
when
he
got
here
hardrada
ought
to
have
watched
he
knew
he
was
dealing
with
his
enemies
so
did
tostig
and
i
believe
he
suspected
something
sleep
stopped
him
there
and
he
arose
the
next
morning
with
a
feeling
that
he
was
going
to
walk
out
into
something
entirely
new
he
was
now
no
longer
a
norway
viking
invading
england
with
harold
hardrada
the
sea
king
nor
was
he
any
longer
under
the
special
protection
of
tostig
the
earl
all
of
his
previous
experiences
as
he
said
of
them
were
so
many
back
numbers
and
he
was
now
king
harold
of
england
devoted
follower
he
winced
a
little
also
when
he
remembered
that
he
was
regarded
as
one
of
the
heroes
of
the
great
battle
of
stamford
bridge
during
this
day
and
several
more
which
followed
he
was
left
almost
altogether
by
himself
for
father
brian
had
affairs
of
his
own
to
attend
to
it
is
just
the
way
i
like
to
have
it
said
ned
now
i
a
good
horse
that
wo
pitch
me
over
his
head
as
nanny
did
i
going
to
ride
all
around
and
see
the
country
i
see
the
city
better
too
like
to
tell
father
and
mother
what
i
doing
too
the
city
gates
were
open
now
and
all
men
came
and
went
at
their
will
there
were
throngs
of
them
for
all
the
country
people
were
eager
to
get
a
glimpse
of
their
victorious
king
and
his
wonderful
army
ned
found
nothing
to
hinder
him
therefore
and
he
made
his
horseback
excursions
industriously
the
very
first
of
them
carried
him
once
more
over
stamford
bridge
and
across
the
he
had
thought
he
would
wish
to
look
at
it
and
remember
the
fighting
but
he
did
not
linger
there
for
a
moment
it
is
too
dreadful
he
exclaimed
urging
his
horse
forward
i
never
want
to
see
a
again
that
is
not
after
all
the
battle
is
over
i
ride
on
and
see
if
i
can
visit
lars
and
vebba
it
was
not
so
very
long
a
gallop
to
the
bank
of
the
humber
large
numbers
of
norway
were
still
there
anchored
or
moored
to
the
shore
but
ned
searched
among
them
in
vain
for
a
glimpse
of
his
old
friend
the
the
fact
was
that
these
ships
which
remained
were
such
as
had
been
surrendered
after
the
defeat
of
hardrada
army
quite
a
number
which
had
been
ready
for
sea
had
sailed
away
at
once
carrying
such
vikings
as
had
not
marched
to
the
derwent
at
all
and
with
them
a
great
many
of
the
first
arriving
fugitives
i
guess
she
got
away
said
ned
she
belonged
to
vebba
i
hope
he
and
lars
are
on
board
of
her
some
day
i
mean
to
visit
norway
again
and
go
and
see
them
but
they
do
better
if
they
emigrate
to
america
king
harold
of
england
was
dealing
very
mercifully
with
the
beaten
invaders
it
was
said
that
he
had
given
two
dozen
of
the
captured
vessels
for
his
prisoners
to
go
home
in
it
would
do
for
him
to
kill
them
remarked
ned
as
he
rode
homeward
i
guess
he
was
glad
to
be
rid
of
them
other
days
went
by
and
ned
spent
most
of
the
in
on
horseback
so
that
he
saw
a
great
deal
of
that
part
of
northumberland
he
returned
to
the
tavern
pretty
well
tired
out
one
evening
and
just
as
he
was
carrying
a
sputtering
he
heard
heavy
footsteps
behind
him
and
a
cheery
voice
that
shouted
my
boy
our
luck
hath
come
a
messenger
came
from
london
to
the
king
to
tell
him
that
the
fleet
of
duke
william
of
normandy
hath
been
seen
off
the
southern
coast
before
harold
and
his
army
can
get
there
the
normans
will
all
be
landed
they
will
have
before
them
soon
a
greater
battle
than
the
one
that
was
fought
with
the
norwegians
putting
fulford
and
stamford
bridge
together
that
bad
news
for
england
said
ned
a
host
of
men
will
be
killed
i
ready
anyhow
i
want
to
see
king
harold
win
another
victory
thou
knowest
very
little
about
that
replied
the
missionary
going
on
up
the
stairs
with
him
no
man
may
say
how
a
battle
will
turn
out
until
after
the
fighting
is
over
i
will
ask
thee
one
thing
however
canst
thou
speak
at
all
in
french
of
course
i
can
said
ned
i
learned
it
at
home
when
i
was
a
little
chap
it
may
yet
be
a
good
thing
for
thee
said
father
brian
i
have
it
upon
my
mind
however
that
the
greater
part
of
duke
william
motley
army
speak
tongues
of
their
own
and
not
a
word
of
french
it
is
a
speech
i
have
not
yet
heard
it
may
be
that
thou
and
i
will
listen
to
it
before
long
i
guess
so
said
ned
i
have
a
talk
with
king
harold
french
prisoners
after
he
whips
the
duke
ned
admiration
for
the
saxon
king
had
been
strengthening
rapidly
from
day
to
day
as
he
heard
men
talk
about
him
he
did
not
now
entertain
any
idea
that
his
hero
could
really
be
beaten
by
duke
william
at
the
same
time
he
had
begun
to
pick
up
rapidly
a
number
of
words
of
several
kinds
of
saxon
this
had
helped
him
very
much
in
a
number
of
conversations
with
the
king
it
had
also
proved
convenient
at
the
tavern
among
the
citizens
of
york
and
among
the
country
people
the
saxon
army
had
been
resting
well
during
all
these
days
and
it
had
been
preparing
for
the
long
severe
march
which
its
royal
commander
had
known
it
must
soon
perform
he
statesman
as
well
as
general
had
been
setting
in
order
the
tangled
affairs
of
the
great
northern
earldoms
the
two
earls
of
mercia
and
northumberland
edwin
and
morcar
had
professed
utter
loyalty
to
him
they
had
promised
to
bring
all
the
forces
they
could
muster
to
join
the
army
which
was
to
oppose
duke
william
of
normandy
this
nevertheless
would
require
time
and
the
king
could
not
now
wait
for
any
new
levies
he
was
needed
to
defend
the
southern
counties
of
england
and
especially
to
prevent
the
speedy
capture
of
london
by
the
normans
the
mounted
the
thingmen
were
ready
to
march
on
the
day
following
the
arrival
of
the
messenger
who
brought
the
tidings
concerning
duke
william
fleet
it
may
be
that
even
then
king
harold
was
aware
of
the
terrible
truth
that
the
landing
of
the
normans
had
already
begun
at
pevensey
on
the
southern
coast
only
three
days
after
the
battle
of
stamford
bridge
he
was
also
aware
nevertheless
that
the
transfer
from
ship
to
shore
of
such
a
host
as
that
of
william
with
its
supplies
and
with
a
vast
number
of
horses
for
its
cavalry
was
a
task
which
would
surely
require
a
number
of
days
more
time
would
necessarily
be
consumed
after
that
in
getting
the
invading
army
into
shape
for
any
considerable
forward
movement
it
was
still
possible
therefore
for
harold
and
his
army
to
get
to
london
in
season
if
he
could
save
his
capital
city
then
would
follow
the
awful
struggle
that
was
sure
to
come
for
england
throne
and
freedom
out
of
the
ouse
gate
of
the
old
city
of
york
rode
the
mailed
horsemen
in
close
array
behind
them
in
endless
columns
strode
the
footmen
thousand
after
thousand
perhaps
not
a
man
who
saw
them
march
away
could
have
believed
what
a
fate
was
waiting
for
them
on
the
southern
shore
of
the
land
they
were
going
to
defend
my
boy
said
father
brian
thou
and
i
will
keep
close
along
toward
the
front
the
king
himself
rideth
far
ahead
of
all
he
intendeth
to
stir
up
as
he
goeth
along
all
the
fighting
strength
of
the
middle
counties
i
afraid
i
wo
have
a
chance
to
get
at
him
replied
ned
i
want
to
let
him
know
the
truth
about
that
affair
of
sikend
the
berserker
thou
mayest
let
that
rest
said
the
good
missionary
he
hath
quite
enough
to
busy
him
just
now
i
think
he
may
be
caring
very
little
who
it
was
that
speared
one
viking
only
i
bid
thee
keep
good
care
of
thy
tongue
and
speak
only
the
truth
it
is
always
bad
for
a
man
to
win
upon
false
pretences
see
that
thou
maintain
thy
honesty
my
boy
i
guess
i
will
said
ned
there
is
anything
crooked
about
me
if
a
man
will
tell
a
falsehood
the
next
thing
he
will
be
caught
passing
counterfeit
money
thou
hast
a
great
many
of
thy
york
saxon
sayings
remarked
father
brian
that
thou
art
not
able
to
turn
into
good
latin
i
have
found
it
so
with
all
the
heathen
i
have
ever
been
among
it
sometimes
maketh
me
wish
that
i
were
back
at
clontarf
to
hear
men
talking
good
sense
once
more
i
give
that
up
however
for
my
duty
biddeth
me
to
remain
that
i
may
do
somewhat
for
the
civilisation
and
instruction
of
these
ignorant
english
people
this
was
an
undertaking
concerning
which
the
good
man
was
becoming
more
and
more
enthusiastic
it
was
plain
that
he
cared
for
it
much
more
than
he
did
for
any
victories
or
defeats
of
either
norman
william
or
saxon
harold
ned
had
heard
him
saying
to
himself
little
odds
is
it
which
of
the
two
shall
wear
the
crown
provided
that
these
millions
of
human
beings
shall
be
made
over
into
something
better
than
so
many
cattle
they
are
little
more
than
that
now
at
first
even
after
exploring
york
ned
had
hardly
agreed
with
him
but
he
learned
a
great
deal
as
they
rode
along
and
as
he
saw
the
actual
state
of
things
in
england
day
followed
day
and
the
mounted
rode
steadily
onward
town
after
town
camp
after
camp
was
reached
and
left
behind
everywhere
the
king
was
welcomed
with
noisy
acclamations
he
appeared
indeed
to
be
exceedingly
well
beloved
by
his
subjects
of
every
rank
and
kind
they
are
all
sorts
though
was
a
remark
that
ned
was
forced
to
make
concerning
them
and
he
added
what
they
want
is
about
forty
thousand
father
brians
large
numbers
he
discovered
were
no
better
than
slaves
the
property
of
the
landholders
they
had
no
hope
whatever
of
improving
their
condition
even
the
freemen
were
only
a
shade
better
off
not
many
even
of
the
rich
and
titled
were
able
to
read
and
write
there
were
a
great
many
other
faults
to
find
sometimes
said
ned
i
almost
think
england
ought
to
be
conquered
harold
or
somebody
else
ought
to
stir
up
things
with
a
long
pole
he
was
hardly
able
to
say
what
he
would
try
to
do
first
if
he
were
king
and
he
determined
to
have
a
talk
about
it
with
harold
some
day
after
he
should
have
beaten
the
normans
the
country
they
rode
through
was
very
beautiful
after
all
some
of
the
towns
were
fairly
well
built
some
of
the
castles
and
palaces
were
picturesque
and
attractive
there
were
numberless
green
fields
and
fruitful
orchards
the
flocks
of
sheep
and
the
herds
of
cattle
looked
like
prosperity
then
too
there
were
grand
old
forests
of
oaks
and
other
trees
and
ned
saw
herd
after
herd
of
beautiful
red
deer
no
poor
man
dares
to
hunt
them
they
tell
me
he
said
of
the
deer
they
hang
him
as
if
he
killed
a
man
not
even
if
he
were
starving
it
is
a
good
deal
as
father
brian
says
the
lower
kinds
of
people
in
england
are
treated
as
if
they
were
beasts
above
these
nevertheless
were
the
hundreds
of
thousands
of
yeomanry
the
farmers
the
squires
the
thanes
great
and
small
and
from
among
these
king
harold
was
now
trying
to
strengthen
his
army
no
doubt
his
success
in
doing
so
would
have
been
better
if
more
time
had
been
given
him
but
as
he
pushed
onward
messenger
after
messenger
came
riding
swiftly
to
tell
him
of
the
vast
numbers
and
warlike
appearance
of
the
host
of
william
of
normandy
this
was
now
all
landed
they
reported
and
it
was
almost
ready
for
a
march
upon
london
where
there
was
nothing
to
oppose
it
but
a
moderate
force
under
gyrth
earl
of
the
east
angles
and
younger
brother
of
the
king
i
want
to
see
gyrth
said
ned
to
the
missionary
they
say
he
is
another
hero
like
harold
chapter
xiii
the
host
of
the
normans
london
london
london
exclaimed
ned
the
son
of
webb
slowly
and
thoughtfully
after
all
i
had
heard
and
read
about
this
place
i
had
the
ghost
of
an
idea
of
what
it
would
really
be
i
went
through
all
the
london
too
that
uncle
jack
brought
home
with
him
i
guess
it
changed
a
good
deal
before
they
were
printed
he
had
other
remarks
to
make
and
some
of
them
were
uncomplimentary
it
appeared
that
he
had
been
going
through
all
quarters
of
the
english
capital
city
ever
since
he
rode
into
it
with
the
of
the
king
he
knew
something
of
its
history
old
british
roman
saxon
and
he
could
add
to
that
wonderful
ideas
of
what
it
would
be
in
the
years
to
come
he
had
taken
careful
notes
of
its
larger
buildings
its
walls
and
fortifications
i
think
that
duke
william
was
wise
he
remarked
in
not
coming
here
until
he
was
entirely
ready
it
a
strong
place
he
could
not
have
taken
it
right
away
king
harold
knew
it
could
stand
a
siege
or
he
would
not
have
gone
to
fight
the
vikings
nevertheless
until
the
return
of
their
king
and
his
army
the
people
of
london
had
been
in
a
panic
of
fear
lest
their
town
should
be
taken
and
sacked
by
the
invaders
now
said
ned
at
last
i
have
seen
enough
of
these
dirty
streets
they
are
as
bad
as
those
of
york
or
worse
i
go
and
get
my
horse
and
see
if
father
brian
has
come
his
learned
irish
friend
had
been
full
of
affairs
of
his
own
ever
since
their
arrival
he
too
moreover
had
been
exploring
london
and
he
had
formed
a
very
low
opinion
of
its
civilisation
ned
found
him
waiting
shortly
in
the
queer
old
hostelry
which
had
been
assigned
them
by
the
army
authorities
as
their
quarters
my
boy
exclaimed
father
brian
i
am
glad
to
see
thee
oh
the
heathen
town
that
this
is
it
is
full
of
thieves
it
is
exceedingly
disorderly
and
dirty
i
may
say
that
the
army
being
here
doth
not
make
it
any
better
ah
me
i
shall
be
glad
when
the
battle
is
over
and
we
know
which
of
the
twain
is
to
be
king
of
this
place
whichever
it
may
be
he
hath
a
long
hard
bit
of
work
before
him
to
make
this
country
what
it
ought
to
be
there
could
be
no
doubt
of
that
but
ned
the
son
of
webb
was
not
just
now
much
interested
in
questions
of
reform
and
education
his
head
was
full
of
army
affairs
and
father
brian
was
his
best
newspaper
what
exclaimed
the
missionary
in
reply
to
ned
questioning
will
the
saxons
fight
indeed
they
will
and
king
harold
himself
is
to
lead
his
army
i
am
told
that
his
brother
gyrth
the
brave
man
that
he
is
asked
permission
to
lead
this
battle
himself
and
urged
the
king
to
stay
out
of
it
he
said
that
then
harold
would
have
time
to
gather
more
troops
gyrth
might
be
defeated
and
killed
but
the
kingdom
would
not
be
lost
all
at
once
what
is
more
harold
might
lay
waste
all
the
lands
nearest
the
normans
and
starve
them
out
fighting
them
inch
by
inch
he
is
an
unselfish
patriot
to
offer
his
life
in
that
way
what
did
the
king
say
asked
ned
as
thou
mightest
expect
i
think
replied
father
brian
he
declared
that
he
would
waste
no
english
land
nor
burn
an
english
house
he
would
allow
no
other
man
to
fight
and
die
in
his
place
he
would
lead
his
own
army
he
said
and
he
is
right
about
that
no
he
is
said
ned
he
had
better
take
gyrth
advice
he
is
risking
too
much
upon
one
battle
he
hath
not
men
enough
here
to
beat
the
normans
king
harold
knoweth
best
said
father
brian
his
men
would
not
fight
as
well
under
anybody
else
his
absence
might
dishearten
them
now
i
tell
thee
they
say
that
the
norman
duke
hath
sixty
thousand
men
but
that
the
most
of
them
are
of
all
sorts
taken
as
they
came
harold
of
england
hath
only
a
quarter
as
many
indeed
but
the
main
body
of
them
consists
of
picked
and
chosen
warriors
veterans
there
is
a
great
strength
in
that
thou
meanest
said
ned
that
no
common
men
are
fit
to
face
the
the
duke
should
have
seen
them
at
stamford
he
knoweth
them
i
suppose
said
father
brian
it
maketh
him
slow
and
cautious
the
thingmen
will
all
die
where
they
stand
and
i
think
that
many
other
men
will
die
when
they
do
it
is
a
pity
that
they
were
at
the
north
and
not
here
when
the
fleet
of
william
came
to
pevensey
had
they
been
at
hand
the
normans
would
not
have
gotten
ashore
at
all
harold
would
have
slaughtered
them
at
the
water
edge
all
of
that
is
tostig
work
said
ned
angrily
he
stirred
up
hardrada
to
come
with
his
vikings
just
at
the
worst
time
he
hath
paid
for
it
with
his
life
replied
father
brian
and
it
is
a
heavy
load
for
any
man
to
put
upon
his
soul
one
bad
ambitious
selfish
plotter
may
sometimes
do
a
vast
amount
of
bloody
mischief
all
that
was
of
the
past
and
there
was
no
help
for
it
everybody
was
well
aware
moreover
that
there
had
been
an
exchange
of
embassies
day
after
day
between
the
king
and
duke
william
terms
of
settlement
had
been
offered
and
rejected
for
neither
of
them
would
give
up
the
main
point
of
dispute
the
right
to
the
crown
of
england
therefore
there
could
be
no
compromise
and
the
sword
must
decide
while
the
two
friends
had
been
talking
their
horses
had
been
brought
out
they
mounted
now
and
rode
out
together
through
one
of
the
southerly
gates
these
walls
and
the
forts
are
quite
strong
remarked
father
brian
the
best
work
on
them
was
done
long
ago
by
the
romans
i
have
thought
that
if
i
were
harold
i
would
wait
for
the
normans
at
this
place
one
of
the
told
me
said
ned
that
the
king
had
chosen
a
better
he
had
seen
it
himself
he
had
the
least
idea
that
the
king
will
be
beaten
he
would
not
be
replied
the
missionary
if
all
of
his
men
were
like
them
man
for
man
the
normans
have
nothing
like
them
they
will
cleave
through
shield
or
mail
or
helmet
with
a
blow
of
their
axes
they
fear
nothing
the
guards
posted
at
the
city
gates
were
not
questioning
any
who
came
or
went
and
people
from
all
directions
were
seeking
safety
within
the
walls
none
of
these
had
yet
been
harmed
but
before
ned
and
his
companion
had
ridden
many
miles
they
found
the
roads
crowded
with
men
women
and
children
fleeing
inland
from
the
cruelty
of
the
invaders
terrible
tales
were
told
by
these
poor
fugitives
of
the
atrocities
already
inflicted
upon
the
by
the
savage
rabble
of
which
a
large
part
of
william
army
consisted
this
was
to
have
been
expected
whether
the
duke
willed
it
or
not
and
saxon
england
was
receiving
a
sad
warning
of
the
methods
by
which
from
that
time
onward
its
conquest
was
to
be
completed
both
ned
the
son
of
webb
and
the
missionary
were
now
getting
excited
and
they
rode
faster
the
whole
affair
was
becoming
more
real
to
them
it
was
a
tremendous
thing
to
think
of
the
entire
future
history
of
england
was
about
to
be
decided
by
one
great
fight
and
everything
relating
to
that
was
to
be
studied
with
almost
feverish
interest
it
was
late
in
the
day
when
father
brian
drew
his
rein
exclaiming
there
my
boy
look
yonder
that
is
the
ridge
and
hill
of
senlac
that
is
where
harold
hath
chosen
to
wait
for
william
he
is
wise
it
is
a
very
strong
military
position
then
why
on
earth
asked
ned
did
not
the
duke
send
a
force
ahead
and
seize
it
it
was
right
in
his
way
if
he
intended
to
march
for
london
perhaps
he
knew
it
not
said
father
brian
he
is
in
a
strange
country
i
believe
that
he
would
prefer
to
have
the
saxon
army
come
on
and
meet
him
at
almost
any
place
what
he
needeth
most
of
all
is
this
very
battle
to
be
fought
without
delay
for
his
host
is
eating
up
its
provisions
this
ridge
of
senlac
if
thou
wilt
mark
it
will
prove
a
for
him
or
for
harold
as
the
fight
may
turn
either
way
can
the
king
be
caught
in
it
asked
ned
i
know
not
yet
grimly
responded
the
missionary
i
heard
once
though
of
a
man
who
trapped
a
bear
the
trap
was
a
good
one
and
the
bear
was
in
it
how
did
it
work
then
asked
ned
i
heard
that
soon
there
was
very
little
left
of
either
the
trap
or
the
hunter
growled
father
brian
it
was
a
large
bear
come
on
now
and
we
will
see
what
all
these
men
are
doing
they
are
as
busy
as
bees
the
long
low
hill
toward
which
they
were
riding
was
somewhat
steep
upon
its
southerly
side
from
end
to
end
it
now
swarmed
with
toilers
it
had
been
generally
understood
that
the
saxon
army
had
not
yet
left
london
and
who
then
were
these
father
brian
gazed
at
them
in
silence
for
a
minute
or
so
before
he
turned
in
his
saddle
to
say
with
energy
the
trap
is
well
set
for
catching
the
duke
king
harold
knew
what
might
be
done
with
this
reach
of
land
he
hath
sent
on
his
two
brothers
and
a
sufficient
force
to
fortify
the
ridge
seest
thou
they
are
making
a
strong
breastwork
of
timber
and
in
some
places
more
than
that
i
think
it
might
stop
any
charge
of
duke
william
best
horsemen
they
will
fare
but
badly
with
harold
axmen
behind
the
barrier
let
us
ride
on
there
was
an
elevation
high
enough
to
be
described
by
ned
as
a
hill
at
a
little
distance
behind
the
ridge
toward
the
right
and
here
too
the
men
were
fortifying
the
defences
at
the
front
were
sufficiently
extensive
to
bar
the
entire
way
by
which
the
normans
must
come
in
their
march
northward
from
their
camps
these
were
not
now
at
their
pevensey
but
near
the
coast
village
of
hastings
several
miles
nearer
to
senlac
that
means
bloody
pond
or
the
lake
of
blood
remarked
ned
there
is
a
pond
in
new
york
state
that
is
named
so
from
an
old
fight
with
the
indians
i
do
see
any
kind
of
pond
around
here
there
may
have
been
one
once
replied
father
brian
maybe
they
let
the
water
out
of
it
or
it
dried
up
somehow
and
left
the
name
of
it
sticking
to
the
hill
there
will
be
blood
enough
spilled
here
to
fill
a
pond
i
am
afraid
they
rode
nearer
the
hill
now
and
on
the
crest
of
it
they
saw
two
mailed
men
on
horseback
hear
them
whispered
father
brian
hark
to
the
two
great
earls
oh
gyrth
my
brother
said
one
of
them
loudly
and
cheerfully
here
will
we
set
up
the
standards
i
think
the
axmen
of
england
can
hold
yonder
lines
against
all
the
motley
pirates
under
duke
william
or
else
calmly
responded
gyrth
here
will
the
sons
of
godwin
die
our
brother
sveyn
is
gone
long
since
tostig
is
slain
harold
and
thou
and
i
remain
oh
leofwine
thou
art
ever
but
yonder
is
a
mighty
host
between
us
and
the
sea
so
be
it
responded
leofwine
as
recklessly
as
ever
let
them
come
on
i
care
not
at
all
to
live
under
the
yoke
of
william
the
norman
it
were
far
better
to
die
in
battle
i
would
that
all
england
were
of
one
mind
with
thee
in
that
matter
replied
gyrth
then
were
we
not
so
few
this
day
the
levies
of
the
midland
counties
are
all
so
laggard
in
coming
moreover
edwin
and
morcar
have
been
but
from
the
beginning
i
think
they
wait
to
hear
the
ending
of
this
very
battle
they
made
a
good
fight
at
fulford
said
leofwine
many
of
the
northumberland
spearmen
were
at
stamford
bridge
if
we
may
but
baffle
the
first
assault
of
the
normans
and
hold
them
in
check
a
few
days
we
shall
soon
thereafter
be
strong
enough
to
send
the
duke
of
normandy
back
to
his
ships
such
is
the
war
policy
of
harold
responded
gyrth
there
is
a
deep
wisdom
in
it
if
we
may
hold
our
lines
through
but
one
day
only
i
will
say
no
more
now
my
brother
i
have
a
strange
foreboding
upon
me
and
i
like
not
the
name
of
this
place
the
lake
of
blood
said
leofwine
ay
all
england
will
be
made
red
enough
if
we
hold
not
the
hill
against
duke
william
who
knoweth
the
spot
that
waiteth
for
thine
and
mine
god
only
responded
gyrth
i
had
thought
too
that
he
would
fight
on
our
side
for
the
freedom
of
england
they
turned
their
horses
heads
and
rode
away
from
the
hill
to
pass
along
the
lines
inspecting
the
defences
both
of
the
listeners
were
silent
a
moment
for
they
had
heard
enough
to
make
them
thoughtful
those
two
are
brave
men
said
father
brian
then
i
fear
they
have
spoken
a
hard
truth
the
people
have
not
come
to
the
king
help
loyally
they
may
pay
for
their
lack
sorely
after
their
king
is
gone
from
them
didst
thou
hear
them
speak
of
their
older
brother
sveyn
he
was
like
them
for
fighting
well
but
he
had
a
wild
spirit
in
him
it
is
rare
that
there
are
five
in
one
family
that
are
like
the
sons
of
old
earl
godwin
both
of
them
wished
for
a
closer
look
at
the
defences
and
they
rode
onward
it
was
surprising
how
much
had
been
done
already
and
the
force
which
the
king
had
sent
forward
to
protect
the
workmen
was
more
than
half
of
his
army
nothing
less
than
a
rush
made
with
all
the
power
of
the
invaders
could
have
carried
the
ridge
that
evening
what
i
like
to
do
now
said
ned
is
to
ride
out
and
try
for
a
look
at
some
of
the
norman
camps
what
sayest
thou
i
am
with
thee
replied
father
brian
we
may
well
ride
sword
in
hand
my
boy
lest
we
chance
to
run
against
some
stray
party
of
normans
i
will
unsling
my
where
didst
thou
get
that
long
spear
it
was
given
me
by
one
of
the
said
ned
it
is
not
too
heavy
for
me
in
spite
of
the
long
shaft
it
is
a
kind
of
lance
i
will
get
me
one
like
it
then
as
soon
as
i
can
said
the
missionary
combatively
i
may
yet
have
to
push
some
norman
from
his
saddle
i
can
throw
a
spear
fairly
well
too
that
is
one
thing
that
i
learned
at
clontarf
it
was
not
a
bad
idea
certainly
that
the
missionaries
who
were
sent
out
in
such
times
as
these
were
should
be
sufficiently
well
trained
in
the
use
of
weapons
to
defend
themselves
if
they
should
ever
be
attacked
for
instance
by
bears
or
wolves
at
several
places
the
senlac
ridge
was
cut
by
ravines
which
added
to
its
defensive
character
at
others
the
saxon
workmen
had
dug
deep
ditches
at
the
weaker
points
where
the
slope
below
was
less
steep
strong
palisades
had
been
set
instead
of
mere
breastworks
in
these
lines
of
palisades
were
gateways
and
through
one
of
these
which
was
as
yet
left
open
ned
rode
out
with
father
brian
it
a
strong
fort
exclaimed
ned
as
he
looked
behind
him
at
the
defences
ay
said
father
brian
for
such
men
as
will
hold
it
i
think
better
of
king
harold
prospects
unless
i
am
in
error
all
the
men
from
the
london
camps
were
to
march
this
day
they
will
be
here
before
sunrise
they
were
indeed
arriving
at
that
very
hour
but
both
the
king
and
the
duke
were
willing
that
there
should
be
no
battle
until
all
things
were
ready
on
both
sides
there
were
to
be
further
negotiations
and
the
fort
builders
were
to
have
more
time
for
the
completion
of
their
work
there
were
several
miles
of
broken
country
between
hastings
and
senlac
some
of
the
advanced
encampments
of
the
normans
were
very
nearly
midway
between
the
saxon
lines
and
the
seashore
it
was
toward
one
of
these
outermost
camps
containing
it
might
be
a
large
force
of
the
invaders
that
ned
and
the
missionary
were
now
riding
so
far
as
they
could
discern
nothing
in
the
nature
of
fortification
had
been
done
here
for
no
attack
was
to
be
expected
they
were
aware
nevertheless
that
norman
patrols
would
surely
be
out
on
duty
and
that
loose
parties
from
such
an
army
would
probably
be
going
hither
and
thither
for
plunder
or
even
for
mere
adventure
hearest
thou
the
sound
of
duke
william
army
said
ned
it
is
like
the
early
morning
roar
of
a
great
city
it
is
the
sound
of
a
cataract
exclaimed
father
brian
i
hear
it
but
i
was
thinking
of
quite
another
thing
my
boy
a
swift
dash
of
the
thingmen
might
make
wild
work
of
yonder
camp
this
night
king
harold
could
do
a
great
deal
better
than
that
replied
ned
if
he
had
a
few
batteries
of
heavy
artillery
on
the
ridge
at
senlac
they
would
be
within
easy
range
of
all
these
camps
he
could
pitch
percussion
shells
among
them
all
night
long
duke
william
would
find
it
very
interesting
i
can
tell
him
speak
it
in
latin
said
the
good
man
and
then
ned
found
himself
compelled
to
say
something
which
did
not
include
shells
and
cannon
hither
cometh
a
norman
squad
suddenly
interrupted
the
missionary
getting
ready
his
thy
spear
my
boy
be
on
guard
they
are
taking
us
for
enemies
without
question
i
guess
we
will
have
to
take
them
then
said
ned
there
are
only
four
of
them
here
goes
he
spurred
his
horse
forward
as
he
spoke
but
it
was
not
to
meet
genuine
norman
these
fellows
were
only
breton
marauders
armoured
imperfectly
and
mounted
on
ponies
they
came
dashing
forward
irregularly
instead
of
charging
together
i
hate
to
kill
a
man
muttered
ned
and
he
did
not
do
so
for
the
foremost
breton
fell
from
his
pony
with
no
worse
harm
than
a
in
the
arm
ned
shield
caught
a
from
the
second
assailant
and
it
was
not
repeated
for
father
brian
ax
came
down
upon
that
man
helmet
and
one
more
saddle
was
empty
down
with
them
roared
the
valiant
missionary
thou
hast
laid
one
more
upon
the
sand
the
spear
did
go
through
his
corselet
half
an
inch
said
ned
but
there
he
is
the
fourth
breton
exchanged
a
few
blows
with
some
skill
but
father
brian
was
too
much
for
him
and
his
pony
also
was
quickly
riderless
illustration
for
father
brian
ax
came
down
upon
that
helmet
father
brian
hit
him
on
his
shoulder
finely
exclaimed
ned
come
on
now
we
had
better
cut
stick
for
harold
camp
thou
art
right
about
that
replied
his
comrade
there
are
more
of
them
coming
it
did
me
much
good
to
upset
those
heathen
his
reverence
the
abbot
of
clontarf
knoweth
well
what
to
do
with
a
he
drove
off
twenty
wild
knaves
one
day
when
he
was
all
alone
we
buried
full
half
of
them
that
evening
and
the
others
knew
better
than
to
come
again
i
tell
thee
my
boy
the
peace
can
be
well
kept
in
ireland
especially
anywhere
near
the
schools
and
civilisation
it
was
well
for
them
to
ride
rapidly
now
however
for
they
were
pursued
almost
to
a
gate
of
the
saxon
army
palisades
the
one
they
succeeded
in
reaching
was
closed
and
guarded
even
when
father
brian
shouted
out
his
name
and
character
and
what
he
had
been
doing
the
officer
in
command
of
it
let
them
in
only
to
conduct
them
at
once
into
the
presence
of
gyrth
earl
of
the
east
angles
near
a
blazing
the
light
of
which
glittered
and
sparkled
upon
his
splendid
armour
stood
the
hero
brother
of
king
harold
only
the
king
himself
could
be
more
loftily
majestic
in
form
and
manner
not
a
word
did
he
utter
while
father
brian
made
his
very
full
report
and
then
he
said
our
other
scouts
have
erred
somewhat
it
appeareth
the
normans
have
advanced
their
camps
nearer
than
we
were
aware
but
it
is
of
no
consequence
o
priest
i
know
thee
and
thy
pupil
to
be
true
men
he
slew
the
norway
champion
for
us
at
stamford
bridge
and
thou
wert
with
him
go
ye
to
your
camp
speak
not
a
word
whispered
father
brian
to
ned
thou
mayest
explain
that
matter
only
to
the
king
himself
let
well
enough
alone
this
night
that
is
our
safeguard
now
for
we
had
broken
orders
and
knew
it
not
ride
on
low
indeed
did
ned
the
son
of
webb
bow
to
the
saxon
hero
and
he
went
on
in
silence
but
he
was
thinking
remorsefully
what
would
father
and
mother
say
it
is
honest
i
am
cheating
them
about
sikend
there
seemed
to
be
no
help
for
it
at
present
however
and
he
was
glad
to
reach
his
camp
and
dismount
from
his
horse
after
supper
not
even
the
roar
which
arose
from
the
army
and
the
very
busy
could
keep
him
awake
and
he
slept
soundly
until
morning
chapter
xiv
the
battle
of
senlac
both
armies
remained
within
their
lines
that
friday
morning
and
both
were
busily
preparing
for
battle
the
commanders
as
well
as
the
warriors
were
making
ready
the
instructions
given
by
king
harold
to
his
men
were
to
act
altogether
upon
the
defensive
and
to
content
themselves
with
their
strong
position
along
senlac
ridge
if
his
orders
had
been
rigidly
obeyed
by
all
there
would
have
been
no
victory
won
by
william
of
normandy
the
generalship
of
the
king
and
the
valour
of
his
warriors
were
made
of
no
avail
by
the
headlong
folly
of
the
less
disciplined
part
of
the
saxon
army
during
this
day
ambassadors
went
back
and
forth
more
than
once
as
if
the
last
possibility
of
peace
had
not
already
for
ever
passed
away
harold
could
not
consent
to
any
terms
which
did
not
include
the
immediate
departure
of
the
invaders
and
william
could
not
at
this
hour
abandon
his
great
military
enterprise
without
fighting
a
battle
both
armies
were
in
good
spirits
the
normans
might
well
feel
confidence
in
their
greatly
superior
numbers
and
in
the
established
reputation
of
duke
william
as
a
successful
general
the
saxons
on
the
other
hand
appreciated
the
strength
of
their
position
and
they
were
able
to
say
to
one
another
that
harold
the
son
of
godwin
had
never
lost
a
battle
they
believed
him
to
be
at
least
the
equal
of
any
living
army
leader
ned
the
son
of
webb
and
father
brian
were
busy
all
along
the
lines
from
hour
to
hour
but
there
was
nothing
warlike
for
them
to
do
when
however
they
returned
to
their
camp
at
evening
both
of
them
appeared
to
have
become
exceedingly
english
or
at
least
saxon
in
feeling
i
believe
i
know
what
coming
said
ned
the
normans
ca
break
in
we
can
cut
them
all
to
pieces
if
they
try
it
on
the
fight
will
be
long
and
hard
replied
the
missionary
very
seriously
it
will
be
well
for
thee
and
me
to
obtain
places
of
observation
upon
as
high
ground
as
we
may
all
right
said
ned
i
want
to
see
it
all
it
will
be
something
for
me
to
tell
about
when
i
get
home
i
shall
never
forget
it
as
long
as
i
live
ah
my
boy
said
the
good
man
a
great
many
thousands
of
these
saxons
and
normans
will
not
live
to
remember
it
they
slept
again
and
arose
with
the
sun
of
saturday
october
the
day
of
the
great
change
which
came
to
england
it
was
yet
early
in
the
forenoon
when
harold
the
king
rode
slowly
along
his
lines
and
spoke
good
words
to
all
his
soldiers
everywhere
they
responded
to
him
with
loud
enthusiastic
acclamations
of
love
and
loyalty
and
fearlessness
duke
william
of
normandy
also
attended
by
a
brilliant
escort
of
celebrated
warriors
and
men
of
high
rank
rode
from
one
to
another
of
the
serried
masses
of
his
mighty
host
he
addressed
them
with
fiery
eloquence
assuring
them
of
complete
and
speedy
victory
over
the
inferior
forces
opposed
to
them
they
as
well
as
he
however
were
able
to
see
how
strong
were
the
senlac
works
and
how
warlike
and
firm
was
the
saxon
array
behind
the
barriers
ned
the
son
of
webb
and
his
companion
found
that
from
their
post
on
the
hill
they
had
a
good
view
of
both
armies
they
had
been
watching
all
movements
and
indications
with
almost
breathless
interest
it
was
not
yet
noon
when
ned
suddenly
exclaimed
oh
is
this
magnificent
i
do
believe
there
was
ever
anything
more
splendid
in
all
the
world
it
will
be
a
great
battle
my
boy
said
the
missionary
one
of
the
greatest
in
all
history
there
seest
thou
i
see
shouted
ned
the
normans
are
advancing
william
whole
army
is
moving
oh
how
i
wish
our
men
were
armed
with
i
wish
we
had
maxim
guns
and
cannon
looking
out
through
the
palisades
the
normans
would
never
get
near
enough
to
do
any
chopping
on
them
then
chopping
echoed
the
good
man
in
a
very
little
i
think
thou
wilt
see
good
chopping
done
by
the
saxons
the
best
of
our
are
at
the
front
mark
thou
the
slingers
behind
them
and
note
king
bowmen
i
would
there
were
more
of
them
the
archers
and
slingers
of
duke
william
come
on
in
advance
of
his
horsemen
they
are
beginning
too
said
ned
a
stone
from
a
sling
will
break
a
shield
they
say
the
norman
arrows
will
go
through
armour
if
they
hit
said
the
priest
mark
now
this
is
the
advantage
of
the
king
position
ned
could
understand
it
in
a
moment
the
duke
archers
had
a
high
reputation
but
in
this
beginning
of
the
battle
they
laboured
under
a
serious
disadvantage
all
their
skill
and
strength
were
of
small
value
while
they
were
shooting
from
low
ground
at
enemies
who
were
not
only
above
them
but
were
protected
by
walls
of
wood
it
was
evident
that
until
these
defences
were
broken
through
stones
and
arrows
would
make
no
important
impression
upon
harold
men
ha
ha
exclaimed
father
brian
they
sling
well
but
they
are
in
need
of
more
stones
to
throw
a
man
may
not
carry
a
quarry
in
a
quiver
small
harm
have
they
done
and
the
sharp
arrows
are
wasted
on
the
palisades
i
think
duke
william
must
do
better
than
this
or
he
will
get
no
nearer
london
how
lead
would
tell
just
now
responded
ned
the
range
is
getting
short
enough
for
heavy
revolvers
hurrah
here
come
the
norman
spearmen
and
the
mounted
knights
in
full
armour
what
can
lances
do
against
palisades
this
is
grand
the
duke
archers
and
slingers
had
suffered
heavy
losses
and
they
now
fell
back
discomfited
leaving
the
senlac
slope
littered
thickly
with
the
victims
of
the
shafts
and
stones
of
the
saxons
all
was
clear
however
for
the
desperate
assault
which
was
to
test
the
strength
of
king
harold
lines
if
it
were
successful
it
would
be
proved
that
his
judgment
as
a
general
had
been
wrong
and
that
he
ought
not
to
have
faced
the
invaders
at
senlac
the
attack
was
made
in
excellent
order
and
with
desperate
courage
by
masses
which
seemed
to
be
overwhelming
as
they
pressed
onward
up
the
slope
the
arrows
and
javelins
of
the
saxons
came
among
them
in
a
storm
slaying
or
disabling
both
horses
and
men
by
the
hundred
they
did
not
waver
however
and
now
their
foremost
ranks
had
reached
the
palisades
to
be
met
by
the
long
spears
the
missiles
and
the
terrible
how
they
go
down
the
normans
gasped
ned
they
have
not
broken
through
at
any
place
they
are
falling
back
they
are
beaten
what
will
the
duke
do
now
up
to
this
moment
the
king
of
england
and
his
two
brothers
had
remained
on
the
hill
together
that
they
might
better
observe
the
operations
of
both
armies
and
it
must
have
seemed
to
them
that
their
plan
of
battle
promised
complete
success
on
the
duke
left
indeed
his
host
of
bretons
horse
and
foot
had
suffered
such
severe
losses
that
they
were
retreating
in
much
disorder
in
their
panic
rout
they
were
confusing
also
his
left
centre
and
at
the
same
time
his
entire
right
wing
had
staggered
back
down
the
slope
in
dismay
terrible
was
the
disappointment
and
wild
was
the
wrath
of
the
norman
leader
as
he
witnessed
this
first
result
of
the
stubborn
valour
of
the
saxons
they
had
suffered
small
loss
comparatively
and
their
confidence
in
themselves
and
in
their
king
was
stronger
than
ever
it
was
only
too
strong
for
it
became
a
great
danger
sometimes
the
power
of
a
really
great
leader
of
men
shows
at
its
best
under
adverse
circumstances
dark
as
seemed
the
prospect
before
him
duke
william
had
lost
neither
heart
nor
hope
he
was
among
his
troops
now
galloping
from
point
to
point
commanding
directing
encouraging
even
threatening
it
was
by
his
own
personal
exertions
and
address
that
his
beaten
forces
were
rallying
at
the
very
moment
when
the
saxon
right
wing
contrary
to
the
strict
orders
of
king
harold
broke
forth
from
the
security
of
its
defences
to
pursue
the
fleeing
bretons
ned
the
son
of
webb
heard
or
thought
he
heard
a
terrible
exclamation
from
the
king
and
then
both
of
the
earls
his
brothers
gyrth
and
leofwine
spurred
away
they
went
to
recall
the
mistaken
sally
of
their
overconfident
men
but
they
were
too
late
the
quick
eyes
of
duke
william
had
instantly
perceived
his
opportunity
he
was
already
reinforcing
with
fresh
troops
his
rallying
fugitives
and
at
once
in
the
open
field
their
superior
numbers
became
available
in
vain
did
their
rash
saxon
pursuers
rally
around
the
two
royal
brothers
in
vain
did
they
cut
down
hundreds
of
their
foemen
while
they
strove
to
fight
their
way
back
to
the
shelter
of
their
senlac
defences
swarms
groaned
ned
oh
what
swarms
of
normans
are
pouring
around
those
men
william
himself
is
there
more
of
his
are
charging
in
his
very
best
knights
what
there
he
and
earl
gyrth
are
fighting
hand
to
hand
william
horse
is
killed
he
has
fallen
he
is
up
again
gyrth
horse
too
is
killed
they
are
fighting
again
on
foot
is
it
gyrth
no
i
can
see
william
yes
oh
dear
gyrth
is
dead
it
was
terribly
exciting
to
watch
such
a
struggle
as
this
had
become
near
him
sat
king
harold
himself
upon
his
horse
as
motionless
as
a
bronze
image
father
brian
whispered
ned
hoarsely
leofwine
too
is
down
king
harold
hath
no
brothers
now
he
must
fight
the
rest
of
this
battle
alone
oh
this
is
dreadful
dark
indeed
had
now
become
the
prospect
before
the
central
body
of
the
saxon
army
although
the
defences
in
front
of
it
were
unbroken
those
at
its
right
as
well
as
at
its
left
were
very
soon
passed
by
the
normans
it
was
afterward
said
that
duke
william
had
cunningly
ordered
his
troops
on
the
saxon
right
also
to
pretend
flight
that
their
enemies
might
be
tempted
to
follow
as
those
on
the
left
had
followed
the
bretons
illustration
near
him
sat
king
harold
himself
upon
his
horse
as
motionless
as
a
bronze
image
however
that
may
be
the
sun
was
now
sinking
and
the
centre
of
king
harold
army
was
all
that
was
left
of
it
in
good
fighting
order
of
its
assailants
the
number
which
had
fallen
was
believed
to
equal
man
for
man
that
of
all
the
saxons
who
had
been
present
at
senlac
that
morning
nearly
a
fourth
part
of
duke
william
army
therefore
lay
upon
the
field
the
remainder
of
it
however
still
outnumbered
five
to
one
the
remnant
of
king
harold
heroes
firm
as
a
rock
stood
these
and
against
them
the
furious
tide
of
the
invaders
horsemen
and
footmen
broke
in
vain
still
they
held
their
strong
position
upon
the
hill
of
the
standards
the
golden
dragon
of
england
and
the
fighting
man
that
was
harold
own
personal
banner
the
king
himself
was
now
fighting
on
foot
in
the
front
rank
of
his
and
he
had
performed
mighty
deeds
of
valour
in
this
hour
however
the
subtle
war
cunning
of
the
duke
came
to
his
aid
the
shields
and
the
armour
of
the
closely
serried
saxons
behind
these
remaining
works
prevented
the
shafts
of
his
bowmen
from
injuring
greatly
the
solid
wedge
of
warriors
into
which
the
thingmen
and
their
comrades
had
formed
themselves
around
and
on
the
hill
the
battle
could
not
be
altogether
lost
so
long
as
this
living
wall
should
remain
unbroken
all
the
saxons
were
on
foot
and
the
normans
who
were
mounted
gained
little
thereby
since
their
unarmoured
horses
were
so
often
killed
by
javelins
as
they
pressed
forward
shoot
up
shoot
up
shouted
the
duke
to
his
archers
let
the
shafts
fall
upon
them
from
above
they
have
no
shields
over
their
heads
thousands
of
bowmen
at
once
obeyed
him
in
a
moment
more
it
was
as
if
a
thick
hail
of
sharp
arrows
was
falling
among
the
saxons
behind
while
those
who
were
in
front
were
still
compelled
to
hold
their
shields
before
them
the
cunning
device
of
the
duke
might
yet
have
been
baffled
perhaps
but
for
one
of
its
first
fatal
consequences
man
after
man
was
going
down
and
the
king
himself
looked
up
to
see
what
this
might
be
even
as
he
raised
his
head
the
battle
was
lost
and
the
crown
of
england
passed
to
william
of
normandy
for
from
the
sky
above
as
it
seemed
a
hissing
shaft
came
down
and
pierced
through
his
right
eye
to
the
brain
the
king
hath
fallen
screamed
ned
the
son
of
webb
harold
is
dead
he
is
dead
we
are
beaten
england
is
conquered
come
thou
on
with
me
then
said
father
brian
there
are
plenty
of
horses
we
must
speed
away
from
this
place
the
are
wearied
with
long
fighting
but
they
will
all
die
where
they
stand
thou
and
i
have
no
need
to
die
with
them
quickly
now
my
boy
fierce
frenzied
desperate
was
the
last
stand
of
the
saxons
around
the
royal
standards
and
the
dying
king
terrible
was
the
carnage
which
they
made
among
the
normans
but
it
was
as
father
brian
had
said
the
warriors
of
harold
were
worn
out
with
long
fighting
and
they
were
now
continually
assailed
by
arrivals
of
fresh
troops
men
who
had
hitherto
done
little
or
nothing
flesh
and
blood
could
endure
no
more
and
the
work
of
destruction
was
slowly
completed
one
strong
body
of
saxons
it
was
afterward
related
was
actually
getting
away
when
the
darkness
came
it
was
closely
followed
by
the
duke
himself
and
his
then
the
saxons
turned
again
upon
their
pursuers
and
william
not
only
lost
many
horsemen
but
came
very
near
losing
his
own
life
also
in
the
hour
of
victory
where
shall
we
go
now
asked
ned
as
he
and
his
friend
clambered
into
the
saddles
of
two
horses
which
had
been
tethered
in
the
rear
of
the
lost
position
on
the
hill
i
will
guide
thee
my
boy
replied
the
missionary
thou
and
i
may
make
good
our
escape
if
we
are
prudent
how
on
earth
can
we
get
away
from
the
normans
groaned
ned
some
of
them
are
between
us
already
and
all
the
rest
of
england
i
do
see
how
we
are
to
get
through
william
army
we
must
get
out
of
the
battle
first
said
father
brian
then
ride
away
around
into
the
norman
camps
at
the
seashore
we
would
do
well
to
obtain
speech
with
him
in
the
morning
now
that
he
hath
slain
king
harold
and
considereth
himself
the
ruler
of
england
he
will
gladly
welcome
any
from
among
the
saxons
who
cometh
to
him
with
a
peaceful
tongue
be
thou
mindful
of
that
my
boy
i
am
glad
that
thou
art
able
to
speak
french
to
him
so
am
i
said
ned
with
some
energy
i
really
like
to
have
a
good
talk
with
william
the
conqueror
but
oh
father
brian
this
hath
been
an
awful
affair
they
will
not
need
so
many
surgeons
or
ambulances
or
hospitals
as
civilised
armies
would
as
soon
as
any
man
is
down
somebody
killeth
him
they
do
not
seem
to
know
what
mercy
is
that
they
do
not
said
father
brian
thou
wilt
bear
in
mind
however
that
the
killing
of
king
harold
and
all
of
his
best
men
giveth
to
william
of
normandy
all
the
good
title
he
hath
to
the
crown
of
england
if
harold
had
escaped
all
alone
from
this
he
would
be
king
still
the
english
elected
him
fairly
replied
ned
not
one
voter
among
them
put
in
a
ballot
for
the
duke
i
suppose
they
wo
try
to
do
any
more
against
him
after
this
though
let
him
have
it
then
all
i
can
say
is
that
i
hope
there
will
never
be
another
invasion
of
england
by
anybody
no
man
may
foretell
concerning
that
matter
said
the
missionary
there
hath
been
much
fighting
on
this
island
even
ireland
herself
hath
been
attacked
many
a
time
and
she
might
be
again
it
is
my
opinion
though
my
boy
that
england
will
for
ever
continue
to
be
english
whoever
is
king
even
as
ireland
continueth
irish
most
likely
thou
art
right
replied
ned
the
duke
may
bring
in
droves
on
droves
of
normans
and
all
sorts
he
wo
think
of
killing
off
the
angles
and
saxons
and
danes
and
welsh
and
scotch
we
do
when
they
come
to
america
every
kind
that
lands
among
us
becometh
american
and
i
should
wonder
if
even
the
normans
became
englishmen
better
for
them
to
become
civilised
said
the
missionary
thoughtfully
the
duke
will
kill
none
unless
it
may
be
a
few
earls
and
other
high
men
who
may
stand
in
his
way
or
such
commoners
as
resist
him
i
think
he
will
speak
all
others
fairly
and
make
peace
with
them
were
he
not
to
do
so
there
are
axes
enough
left
in
england
to
make
away
with
all
that
the
senlac
battle
hath
left
of
his
army
that
so
exclaimed
ned
i
seen
some
of
them
anyhow
i
want
to
be
an
english
earl
just
now
it
would
be
safe
come
said
father
brian
faster
the
farther
we
get
away
from
senlac
the
safer
we
will
be
from
sword
and
spear
it
is
getting
very
dark
i
am
glad
of
it
after
that
he
did
not
again
draw
his
rein
until
they
had
almost
reached
a
line
of
tents
a
little
distance
inland
from
the
town
of
hastings
now
do
i
wish
i
knew
he
declared
emphatically
which
of
these
may
happen
to
belong
to
some
man
who
was
killed
in
the
battle
oh
ned
the
son
of
webb
let
us
make
trial
of
this
large
one
that
is
nearest
at
hand
speak
thou
to
yonder
gaily
apparelled
youth
in
thy
best
french
ho
whose
tent
is
this
ned
asked
at
once
as
he
rode
nearer
he
shouted
his
question
at
a
young
man
who
appeared
to
be
a
sort
of
esquire
stepping
hastily
forward
from
the
canvas
doorway
to
meet
them
this
is
the
marquee
of
the
sieur
raoul
de
berri
replied
its
custodian
whether
he
be
now
alive
or
dead
we
know
not
what
news
if
any
have
ye
from
the
battle
of
thy
master
i
know
nothing
said
ned
but
of
the
battle
i
can
tell
thee
that
the
saxon
army
is
beaten
and
that
harold
the
king
is
dead
hard
hath
been
the
fighting
all
day
and
the
slain
are
many
there
had
been
hurrying
feet
from
all
directions
toward
the
spot
where
the
two
newcomers
had
halted
and
so
there
had
been
other
hearers
besides
the
gay
esquire
of
sieur
raoul
de
berri
loud
and
prolonged
were
the
shouts
with
which
the
announcement
made
by
ned
was
received
for
before
this
there
had
arrived
doubtful
news
from
the
hard
contested
field
dismount
ye
and
come
in
said
the
esquire
well
may
we
feast
the
bringers
of
joyful
tidings
whoever
ye
may
be
ye
are
most
welcome
even
while
ye
are
eating
and
drinking
moreover
we
pray
you
to
talk
on
we
would
gladly
hear
all
that
we
may
concerning
the
great
battle
how
was
it
fought
can
ye
tell
us
the
names
of
any
that
were
slain
how
fareth
it
with
our
liege
lord
the
duke
that
shall
henceforth
be
king
of
england
it
was
truly
a
good
thing
that
ned
the
son
of
webb
was
so
well
practised
in
his
french
albeit
the
kind
he
spoke
varied
much
from
that
which
was
now
being
uttered
so
volubly
around
him
for
once
indeed
father
brian
was
left
to
something
which
to
him
painfully
resembled
silence
before
long
however
there
arrived
a
swarm
of
french
and
norman
clergymen
all
of
whom
could
understand
the
kind
of
latin
taught
in
the
great
school
at
clontarf
speedily
then
the
good
missionary
went
out
with
them
and
ned
was
left
alone
to
entertain
his
of
eager
and
excited
listeners
all
the
while
moreover
the
good
news
spread
rapidly
through
all
that
camp
and
was
carried
on
to
others
sir
said
ned
to
the
esquire
at
last
i
am
tired
out
i
think
there
is
nothing
else
that
will
use
up
a
man
so
completely
as
a
great
battle
ay
exclaimed
his
new
friend
hospitably
thy
couch
is
prepared
for
thee
thou
hast
fought
well
this
day
well
am
i
assured
that
our
liege
lord
the
duke
of
the
normans
and
the
sieur
de
berri
himself
would
have
us
take
all
care
of
thee
i
shall
be
glad
to
get
to
bed
said
ned
sleep
thou
well
replied
the
esquire
and
on
the
morrow
thou
shalt
surely
be
brought
into
the
presence
of
the
duke
as
thou
desirest
the
appointments
of
that
marquee
and
the
comfort
of
its
arrangements
for
sleeping
were
more
in
accordance
with
norman
luxury
than
with
saxon
plainness
ned
the
son
of
webb
took
note
of
them
weary
as
he
was
nevertheless
before
his
eyes
closed
he
was
thinking
if
here
is
another
of
these
frauds
i
did
do
any
real
fighting
for
either
side
i
afraid
it
as
bad
almost
as
the
stamford
bridge
humbug
and
what
to
do
about
it
i
do
know
oh
how
sorry
i
am
that
i
had
no
opportunity
for
telling
king
harold
that
i
did
not
kill
sikend
the
berserker
i
shall
always
have
the
credit
of
it
without
any
fault
of
mine
they
may
put
it
into
books
of
history
just
like
other
great
exploits
his
slumbers
were
long
and
heavy
and
they
were
broken
at
last
by
a
friendly
shaking
at
the
hands
of
father
brian
up
up
he
shouted
o
ned
the
son
of
webb
hasten
and
eat
thy
breakfast
the
duke
of
normandy
cometh
not
yet
i
think
are
we
to
call
him
the
king
of
england
that
may
not
be
until
he
hath
been
duly
crowned
as
king
my
boy
i
trust
that
now
thou
art
shortly
to
have
speech
with
him
ned
became
very
wide
awake
while
he
heard
what
the
missionary
had
to
say
and
his
mind
grew
very
busy
i
thought
likely
he
said
that
the
duke
would
come
back
to
his
camp
he
wo
march
for
london
till
he
knoweth
what
the
other
saxons
are
doing
his
army
was
badly
mauled
yesterday
anyhow
and
he
must
get
it
into
shape
again
the
army
of
norman
invaders
had
indeed
been
seriously
damaged
if
a
second
english
army
could
have
attacked
them
on
the
day
after
senlac
it
would
have
found
them
unfit
for
another
such
struggle
there
was
no
such
army
in
existence
however
and
william
went
on
with
his
plans
without
armed
interruption
he
went
first
to
inspect
his
fleet
and
he
sent
the
greater
part
of
it
back
to
normandy
and
other
places
at
about
the
middle
of
the
forenoon
of
that
day
the
duke
was
at
a
camp
a
little
south
of
hastings
attended
by
a
number
of
his
great
men
among
them
were
his
brother
odo
bishop
of
bayeux
and
lanfranc
the
famous
scholar
here
it
was
that
ned
the
son
of
webb
and
father
brian
were
brought
before
him
and
they
had
already
been
named
to
the
stern
and
haughty
conquerors
as
the
persons
who
had
brought
the
first
tidings
of
the
victory
they
are
guests
of
mine
my
liege
said
the
sieur
raoul
de
berri
as
he
saw
them
approaching
the
youth
is
a
young
thane
from
northumberland
and
the
priest
is
his
tutor
they
have
prayed
for
an
audience
this
day
will
i
hear
but
few
words
from
any
replied
the
duke
but
if
it
will
please
thee
the
boy
may
speak
let
the
priest
keep
silence
what
wilt
thou
o
ned
the
son
of
webb
ned
had
recently
become
somewhat
hardened
to
meetings
with
remarkable
men
but
he
was
now
gazing
at
the
conqueror
with
manifest
admiration
harold
the
son
of
godwin
himself
had
not
appeared
more
royally
majestic
or
carried
in
his
face
such
an
expression
of
conscious
power
combined
with
indomitable
strength
of
will
ned
kept
his
courage
up
however
and
boldly
responded
o
duke
of
normandy
and
conqueror
of
england
all
i
wanted
to
say
to
thee
is
this
the
best
thing
thou
canst
do
for
this
country
now
it
is
thine
is
to
run
in
railroads
and
telegraph
lines
and
newspapers
as
fast
as
thou
art
able
also
thou
hadst
better
have
lanfranc
appointed
superintendent
of
public
schools
he
can
set
up
primary
and
grammar
schools
and
academies
and
universities
all
over
the
island
i
can
tell
him
what
books
to
get
and
where
to
get
them
i
will
give
him
now
a
complete
list
of
all
i
went
through
at
grammar
school
number
he
could
beat
it
if
he
should
try
halt
thou
then
interrupted
the
duke
lanfranc
this
youth
matter
appertaineth
to
thee
i
know
naught
of
such
affairs
let
his
tutor
lead
him
away
now
he
is
but
malapert
to
urge
me
at
such
a
time
as
this
forward
all
odo
my
brother
we
have
much
to
do
ere
sunset
england
is
yet
but
half
won
and
we
sheathe
not
our
swords
yet
father
brian
hand
had
been
upon
the
bridle
of
ned
horse
and
he
hurried
him
away
o
ned
the
son
of
webb
he
exclaimed
what
is
in
thee
thou
art
overdaring
the
duke
was
all
but
wroth
with
thee
i
guess
that
is
so
said
ned
his
eyes
flashed
as
if
he
had
half
a
mind
to
hit
me
and
i
do
see
why
i
gave
him
the
best
kind
of
advice
didst
thou
not
say
that
thou
hast
some
of
thy
clergymen
friends
to
consult
with
that
have
i
replied
father
brian
and
i
must
go
quickly
to
meet
them
thou
mayest
amuse
thyself
by
riding
around
for
awhile
then
get
thee
back
to
the
tent
of
the
good
sieur
de
berri
there
or
elsewhere
i
hope
to
meet
thee
again
for
our
companionship
hath
been
exceedingly
pleasant
and
profitable
fare
thee
well
for
the
hour
i
must
go
then
father
brian
said
ned
come
back
to
the
tent
if
thou
canst
i
hope
thou
wilt
soon
have
a
mission
school
of
thine
own
there
will
be
scholars
enough
but
where
thou
wilt
get
books
and
things
i
ca
guess
away
rode
the
good
missionary
and
ned
the
son
of
webb
was
left
to
himself
he
did
not
feel
like
exploring
the
camps
of
the
normans
and
his
horse
galloped
on
with
him
until
he
was
pulled
in
at
the
shore
of
the
sea
it
was
at
a
place
where
a
narrow
wooden
pier
jutted
out
from
a
sandy
beach
between
high
rocks
on
either
hand
here
ned
dismounted
and
walked
down
to
the
water
edge
like
a
boy
in
a
dream
a
small
punt
with
a
mast
and
sail
in
it
lay
rocking
on
the
waves
by
the
pier
i
will
take
off
my
armour
before
i
get
in
he
remarked
i
glad
i
kept
on
my
outing
shirt
and
my
trousers
under
my
mail
all
the
while
this
is
a
very
curious
business
i
saved
my
hat
too
oh
do
i
feel
easier
and
lighter
i
never
want
to
be
an
ironclad
again
his
helmet
and
mail
and
shield
and
weapons
were
pitched
from
him
across
the
sand
in
a
hurry
and
he
stepped
eagerly
into
the
boat
a
good
wind
was
blowing
offshore
and
he
put
up
the
sail
to
catch
it
i
do
feel
like
rowing
he
remarked
after
such
a
time
as
i
have
had
this
breeze
ought
to
take
me
to
the
other
side
before
sunset
it
is
a
good
thing
for
me
that
this
is
green
lake
and
not
the
atlantic
ocean
or
the
north
sea
oh
what
a
tremendous
book
that
is
it
safe
in
the
cubby
under
the
stern
seat
too
on
he
sailed
after
that
swiftly
and
silently
over
the
sparkling
billows
of
the
little
lake
almost
before
he
was
aware
of
it
the
punt
ran
ashore
at
the
place
where
nanny
had
so
skilfully
pitched
him
over
her
head
he
saw
the
barrow
among
the
weeds
a
few
yards
away
and
he
went
and
brought
it
to
the
margin
into
it
he
carried
with
great
care
and
an
appearance
of
something
like
respect
the
great
folio
history
of
the
normans
i
go
home
now
he
thought
but
i
wish
i
had
lars
with
me
and
father
brian
i
like
to
show
father
and
mother
and
all
of
them
my
armour
he
found
it
tiresome
work
to
trundle
the
barrow
and
he
was
both
warm
and
weary
when
he
reached
his
grandfather
gate
there
they
are
he
exclaimed
there
a
whole
crowd
of
them
waiting
for
me
hullo
ned
came
loudly
from
within
the
gate
where
have
you
been
all
day
why
uncle
jack
my
dear
child
interrupted
grandmother
webb
i
was
almost
beginning
to
be
worried
about
you
why
did
you
stay
so
did
you
catch
anything
asked
his
grandfather
did
you
get
any
bites
well
responded
ned
hardly
knowing
exactly
what
to
say
i
tell
you
how
it
is
it
was
this
book
my
folio
exclaimed
grandfather
webb
i
had
no
idea
that
you
really
would
take
it
along
i
have
said
no
i
did
said
ned
i
been
invading
england
with
harold
hardrada
of
norway
and
the
vikings
then
i
went
all
the
way
from
york
and

battle
of
stamford
bridge
to
the
battle
of
senlac
with
king
harold
of
england
and
duke
william
the
conqueror
oh
that
it
is
it
exclaimed
uncle
jack
i
know
how
that
is
myself
a
man
can
sit
in
his
own
room
nowadays
and
travel
all
around
the
world
all
he
needs
is
plenty
of

maps
and
histories

all

much
fighting

having
he
had
the
folio
in
his
arms
now
as
if
he
were
hugging
it
but
his
grandfather
took
it
away
as
if
he
were
pleased
to
get
it
back
unwetted
by
a
bath
in
green
lake
and
carried
it
back
to
its
place
in
the
library
