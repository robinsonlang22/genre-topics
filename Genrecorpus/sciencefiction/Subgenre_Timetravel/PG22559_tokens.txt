excuse
me
i
mean
to
say
that
it
was
like
an
endless
diet
of
days
boring
tedious
no
it
loses
too
much
in
the
translation
explete
my
reasons
i
say
do
my
reasons
matter
no
not
to
you
for
you
are
troglodytes
knowing
nothing
of
causes
understanding
only
acts
acts
and
facts
i
will
give
you
acts
and
facts
first
you
must
know
how
i
am
called
my
name
is
foraminifera
bailey
beam
and
i
am
of
adequate
age
and
size
if
you
doubt
this
i
am
prepared
to
fight
once
the
the
tediety
of
life
as
you
might
say
had
made
itself
clear
to
me
there
were
of
course
only
two
alternatives
i
do
not
like
to
die
so
that
possibility
was
out
and
the
remaining
alternative
was
flight
naturally
the
necessary
machinery
was
available
to
me
i
arrogated
a
small
viewing
machine
and
scanned
the
centuries
of
the
past
in
the
hope
that
a
sanctuary
might
reveal
itself
to
my
aching
eyes
kwel
tediety
that
was
back
back
i
went
through
the
ages
back
to
the
century
of
the
dog
back
to
the
age
of
the
crippled
men
i
found
no
time
better
than
my
own
back
and
back
i
peered
back
as
far
as
the
numbered
years
the
century
was
boredom
unendurable
the
a
morass
of
dullness
wherever
i
looked
tediety
was
what
i
found
i
snapped
off
the
machine
and
considered
put
the
problem
thus
was
there
in
all
of
the
pages
of
history
no
age
in
which
a
beam
might
find
adventure
and
excitement
there
had
to
be
it
was
not
possible
i
told
myself
despairing
that
from
the
dawn
of
the
dreaming
primates
until
my
own
time
there
was
no
era
at
all
in
which
i
could
be
happy
yes
i
suppose
happiness
is
what
i
was
looking
for
but
where
was
it
in
my
viewer
i
had
fifty
centuries
or
more
to
look
back
upon
and
that
was
i
decreed
the
trouble
i
could
spend
my
life
staring
into
the
viewer
and
yet
never
discover
the
time
that
was
right
for
me
there
were
simply
too
many
eras
to
choose
from
it
was
like
an
enormous
library
in
which
there
must
there
had
to
be
contained
the
one
fact
i
was
looking
for
that
lacking
an
index
i
might
wear
my
life
away
and
never
find
i
said
the
word
aloud
for
to
be
sure
it
was
the
answer
i
had
the
freedom
of
the
learning
lodge
and
the
index
in
the
reading
room
could
easily
find
for
me
just
what
i
wanted
splendid
splendid
i
almost
felt
cheerful
i
quickly
returned
the
viewer
i
had
been
using
to
the
keeper
and
received
my
deposit
back
i
hurried
to
the
learning
lodge
and
fed
my
specifications
into
the
index
as
follows
that
is
to
say
find
me
a
time
in
recent
past
where
there
is
adventure
and
excitement
where
there
is
a
secret
colorful
band
of
desperadoes
with
whom
i
can
ally
myself
i
then
added
two
specifications
second
that
it
should
be
before
the
time
of
the
high
radiation
levels
and
first
that
it
should
be
after
the
discovery
of
anesthesia
in
case
of
accident
and
retired
to
a
desk
in
the
reading
room
to
await
results
it
took
only
a
few
moments
which
i
occupied
in
making
a
list
of
the
gear
i
wished
to
take
with
me
then
there
was
a
hiss
and
a
crackle
and
in
the
receiver
of
the
desk
a
book
appeared
i
unzipped
the
case
took
it
out
and
opened
it
to
the
pages
marked
on
the
attached
reading
tape
i
had
found
my
wonderland
of
adventure
ah
hours
and
days
of
exciting
preparation
what
a
round
of
packing
and
buying
what
a
filling
out
of
forms
and
a
stamping
of
visas
what
an
orgy
of
injections
and
inoculations
and
preventive
therapy
merely
getting
ready
for
the
trip
made
my
pulse
race
faster
and
my
adrenalin
balance
rise
to
the
very
point
of
paranoia
it
was
like
being
given
a
true
blue
new
chance
to
live
at
last
i
was
ready
i
stepped
into
the
transmission
capsule
set
the
dials
unlocked
the
door
stepped
out
collapsed
the
capsule
and
stored
it
away
in
my
and
looked
about
at
my
new
home
pyew
kwel
smell
of
staleness
of
sourness
above
all
of
coldness
it
was
a
close
matter
then
if
i
would
be
able
to
keep
from
a
violent
eructative
stenosis
as
you
say
i
closed
my
eyes
and
remembered
warm
violets
for
a
moment
and
then
it
was
all
right
the
coldness
was
not
merely
a
smell
it
was
a
physical
fact
there
was
a
damp
grayish
substance
underfoot
which
i
recognized
as
snow
and
in
a
roadway
there
were
a
number
of
wheeled
vehicles
moving
which
caused
the
liquefying
snow
to
splash
about
me
i
adjusted
my
coat
controls
for
warmth
and
deflection
but
that
was
the
best
i
could
do
the
reek
of
stale
decay
remained
then
there
were
also
the
buildings
painfully
almost
vertical
i
believe
it
would
not
have
disturbed
me
if
they
had
been
truly
vertical
but
many
of
them
were
minutes
of
arc
from
a
true
perpendicular
all
of
them
covered
with
a
carbonaceous
material
which
i
instantly
perceived
was
an
inadvertent
deposit
from
the
air
it
was
a
bad
beginning
however
i
was
not
i
made
my
way
down
the
street
as
you
say
toward
where
a
group
of
young
men
were
walking
toward
me
five
abreast
as
i
came
near
they
looked
at
me
with
interest
and
kwel
respect
conversing
with
each
other
in
whispers
i
addressed
them
sirs
please
direct
me
to
the
nearest
recruiting
office
as
you
call
it
for
the
dread
camorra
they
stopped
and
pressed
about
me
looking
at
me
intently
they
were
handsomely
though
crudely
dressed
in
coats
of
a
striking
orange
color
and
long
trousers
of
an
extremely
dark
material
i
decreed
that
i
might
not
have
made
them
understand
me
it
is
always
probable
it
is
understood
that
a
quicknik
course
in
dialects
of
the
past
may
not
give
one
instant
command
of
spoken
communication
in
the
field
i
spoke
again
i
wish
to
encounter
a
representative
of
the
camorra
in
other
words
the
black
hand
in
other
words
the
cruel
and
sinister
sicilian
terrorists
named
the
mafia
do
you
know
where
these
can
be
found
one
of
them
said
nay
what
that
jive
i
puzzled
over
what
he
had
said
for
a
moment
but
in
the
end
decreed
that
his
message
was
sensefree
as
i
was
about
to
speak
however
he
said
suddenly
let
rove
man
and
all
five
of
them
walked
quickly
away
a
few
yards
it
was
quite
disappointing
i
observed
them
conferring
among
themselves
glancing
at
me
and
for
a
time
proposed
terminating
my
venture
for
i
then
believed
that
it
would
be
better
to
return
home
as
you
say
in
order
to
more
adequately
research
the
matter
however
the
five
young
men
came
toward
me
again
the
one
who
had
spoken
before
who
i
now
detected
was
somewhat
taller
and
fatter
than
the
others
spoke
as
follows
you
wanting
the
mafia
i
agreed
he
looked
at
me
for
a
moment
are
you
holding
he
was
inordinately
hard
to
understand
i
said
slowly
and
with
patience
keska
that
say
money
man
you
going
to
slip
us
something
to
help
you
find
these
cats
certainly
money
i
have
a
great
quantity
of
money
instantly
available
i
rejoined
him
this
appeared
to
relieve
his
mind
there
was
a
short
pause
directly
after
which
this
first
of
the
young
men
spoke
you
on
man
yeah
come
with
us
what
to
call
you
i
queried
this
last
statement
and
he
expanded
the
name
what
the
name
you
may
call
me
foraminifera
i
directed
since
i
wished
to
be
incognito
as
you
put
it
and
we
proceeded
along
the
street
all
five
of
the
young
men
indicated
a
desire
to
serve
me
offering
indeed
to
take
my
i
rejected
this
politely
i
looked
about
me
with
lively
interest
as
you
may
well
believe
kwel
dirt
kwel
dinginess
kwel
cold
and
yet
there
was
a
certain
charm
which
i
can
determine
no
way
of
expressing
in
this
language
acts
and
facts
of
course
i
shall
not
attempt
to
capture
the
subjectivity
which
is
the
charm
only
to
transcribe
the
physical
datum
perhaps
even
data
who
knows
my
companions
for
example
they
were
in
appearance
overwrought
looking
about
them
continually
stopping
entirely
and
drawing
me
with
them
into
the
shelter
of
a
door
when
another
man
this
one
wearing
blue
clothing
and
a
visored
hat
appeared
yet
they
were
clearly
devoted
to
me
at
that
moment
since
they
had
put
aside
their
own
projects
in
order
to
escort
me
without
delay
to
the
mafia
mafia
fortunate
that
i
had
found
them
to
lead
me
to
the
mafia
for
it
had
been
clear
in
the
historical
work
i
had
consulted
that
it
was
not
ultimately
easy
to
gain
access
to
the
mafia
indeed
so
secret
were
they
that
i
had
detected
no
trace
of
their
existence
in
other
histories
of
the
period
had
i
relied
only
on
the
conventional
work
i
might
never
have
known
of
their
great
underground
struggle
against
what
you
term
society
it
was
only
in
the
actual
contemporary
volume
itself
the
curiosity
titled
by
one
lait
and
one
mortimer
that
i
had
descried
that
throughout
the
world
this
great
revolutionary
organization
flexed
its
tentacles
the
plexus
within
a
short
distance
of
where
i
now
stood
battling
courageously
with
me
to
help
them
what
heights
might
we
not
attain
kwel
dramatic
delight
my
meditations
were
interrupted
boomers
asserted
one
of
my
five
escorts
in
a
loud
frightened
tone
let
cut
man
he
continued
leading
me
with
them
into
another
entrance
it
appeared
as
well
as
i
could
decree
that
the
cause
of
his
ejaculative
outcry
was
the
discovery
of
perhaps
three
perhaps
four
other
young
men
in
coats
of
the
same
shiny
material
as
my
escorts
the
difference
was
that
they
were
of
a
different
color
being
blue
we
hastened
along
a
lengthy
chamber
which
was
quite
dark
immediately
after
which
the
large
heavy
one
opened
a
way
to
a
serrated
incline
leading
downward
it
was
extremely
dark
i
should
say
there
was
also
an
extreme
smell
quite
like
that
of
the
outer
air
but
enormously
intensified
one
would
suspect
that
there
was
an
incomplete
combustion
of
perhaps
wood
or
coal
as
well
as
a
certain
quantity
of
general
decay
at
any
rate
we
reached
the
bottom
of
the
incline
and
my
escort
behaved
quite
badly
one
of
them
said
to
the
other
four
in
these
words
them
jumpers
follow
us
sure
yeah
there
much
trouble
what
to
prime
this
guy
now
and
split
instantly
they
fell
upon
me
with
violence
i
had
fortunately
become
rather
alarmed
at
their
visible
emotion
of
fear
and
already
had
taken
from
my
a
stollgratz
so
that
i
quickly
turned
it
on
them
i
started
to
replace
the
stollgratz
as
they
fell
to
the
floor
yet
i
realized
that
there
might
be
an
additional
element
of
danger
instead
of
putting
the
stollgratz
in
with
the
other
trade
goods
which
i
had
brought
to
assist
me
in
negotiating
with
the
mafia
i
transferred
it
to
my
jacket
it
had
become
clear
to
me
that
the
five
young
men
of
my
escort
had
intended
to
abduct
and
rob
me
indeed
had
intended
it
all
along
perhaps
having
never
intended
to
convoy
me
to
the
office
of
the
mafia
and
the
other
young
men
those
who
wore
the
blue
jackets
in
place
of
the
orange
were
already
descending
the
incline
toward
me
quite
rapidly
stop
i
directed
them
i
shall
not
entrust
myself
to
you
until
you
have
given
me
evidence
that
you
entirely
deserve
such
trust
they
all
halted
regarding
me
and
the
stollgratz
i
detected
that
one
of
them
said
to
another
that
cat
got
a
zip
the
other
denied
this
saying
that
no
zip
man
yeah
look
at
them
leopards
say
you
bust
them
flunkies
with
that
thing
i
perceived
his
meaning
quite
quickly
you
are
i
rejoined
are
you
associated
in
friendship
with
them
flunkies
hell
no
yeah
they
leopards
and
we
boomer
dukes
you
cool
them
you
do
us
much
good
i
received
this
information
as
indicating
that
the
two
units
were
inimical
and
unfortunately
lapsed
into
an
example
of
the
bivalent
error
since
p
implied
i
sloppily
assumed
that
implied
r
with
you
understand
r
being
taken
as
the
class
of
phenomena
pertinently
favorable
to
me
this
was
a
very
poor
construction
and
of
course
resulted
in
certain
difficulties
qued
after
all
i
stated
them
flunkies
offered
to
conduct
me
to
a
recruiting
office
as
you
say
of
the
mafia
but
instead
tried
to
take
from
me
the
much
money
i
am
holding
i
then
went
on
to
describe
to
them
my
desire
to
attain
contact
with
the
said
mafia
meanwhile
they
descended
further
and
grouped
about
me
in
the
very
little
light
examining
curiously
the
motionless
figures
of
the
leopards
they
seemed
to
be
greatly
impressed
and
at
the
same
time
very
much
puzzled
naturally
they
looked
at
the
leopards
and
then
at
me
they
gave
every
evidence
of
wishing
to
help
me
but
of
course
if
i
had
not
forgotten
that
one
can
not
assume
from
the
statements
implies
boomer
duke
and
implies
foraminifera
that
qued
boomer
duke
implies
foraminifera
if
i
had
not
forgotten
this
i
say
i
should
not
have
been
deceived
for
in
practice
they
were
as
little
favorable
to
me
as
the
leopards
a
certain
member
of
their
party
reached
a
position
behind
me
i
quickly
perceived
that
his
intention
was
not
favorable
and
attempted
to
turn
around
in
order
to
discharge
at
him
with
the
stollgratz
but
he
was
very
rapid
he
had
a
metallic
cylinder
and
with
it
struck
my
head
knocking
me
unconscious
ii
shield
this
candy
store
is
called
chris
there
must
be
ten
thousand
like
it
in
the
city
a
marble
counter
with
perhaps
five
stools
a
display
case
of
cigars
and
a
bigger
one
of
candy
a
few
dozen
girlie
magazines
hanging
by
things
from
wire
ropes
along
the
wall
it
has
a
couple
of
very
small
tables
under
the
magazines
and
a
juke
i
ca
imagine
a
place
like
chris
without
a
juke
i
had
been
sitting
around
chris
for
a
couple
of
hours
and
i
was
beginning
to
get
edgy
the
reason
i
was
sitting
around
chris
was
not
that
i
liked
cokes
particularly
but
that
it
was
one
of
the
places
of
a
juvenile
gang
called
the
leopards
with
whom
i
had
been
trying
to
work
for
nearly
a
year
and
the
reason
i
was
becoming
edgy
was
that
i
did
see
any
of
them
there
the
boy
behind
the
counter
he
had
the
same
first
name
as
i
walter
in
both
cases
though
my
last
name
is
hutner
and
his
is
i
believe
something
puerto
rican
the
boy
behind
the
counter
was
dummying
up
too
i
tried
to
talk
to
him
on
and
off
when
he
was
busy
he
was
busy
most
of
the
time
it
was
too
cold
for
sodas
but
he
just
did
want
to
talk
now
these
kids
love
to
talk
a
lot
of
what
they
say
does
make
sense
either
bullying
or
bragging
or
purposeless
swearing
but
talk
is
their
normal
state
when
they
quiet
down
it
means
trouble
for
instance
if
you
ever
find
yourself
walking
down
street
and
a
couple
of
kids
pass
you
talking
you
do
have
to
bother
looking
around
but
if
they
stop
talking
turn
quickly
you
about
to
be
mugged
not
that
walt
was
a
mugger
as
far
as
i
know
but
that
the
pattern
of
the
enclave
so
his
being
quiet
was
a
bad
sign
it
might
mean
that
a
rumble
was
brewing
and
that
meant
that
my
work
so
far
had
been
pretty
nearly
a
failure
even
worse
it
might
mean
that
somehow
the
leopards
had
discovered
that
i
had
at
last
passed
my
examinations
and
been
appointed
to
the
new
york
city
police
force
as
a
rookie
patrolman
shield
trying
to
work
with
these
kids
is
hard
enough
at
best
they
do
like
outsiders
but
they
particularly
hate
cops
and
i
had
been
trying
for
some
weeks
to
decide
how
i
could
break
the
news
to
them
the
door
opened
hawk
stood
there
he
did
look
at
me
which
was
a
bad
sign
hawk
was
one
of
the
youngest
in
the
leopards
a
skinny
very
dark
kid
who
had
been
reasonably
friendly
to
me
he
stood
in
the
open
door
with
snow
blowing
in
past
him
walt
out
here
man
it
was
me
he
meant
they
call
me
champ
i
suppose
because
i
beat
them
all
shooting
pool
walt
put
down
the
comic
he
had
been
reading
and
walked
out
also
without
looking
at
me
they
closed
the
door
time
passed
i
saw
them
through
the
window
talking
to
each
other
looking
at
me
it
was
something
all
right
they
were
scared
bad
because
these
kids
are
like
wild
animals
if
you
scare
them
they
hit
first
it
the
only
way
they
know
to
defend
themselves
but
on
the
other
hand
a
rumble
would
scare
them
not
where
they
would
show
it
and
finding
out
about
the
shield
in
my
pocket
would
scare
them
either
they
hated
cops
as
i
say
but
cops
were
a
part
of
their
environment
it
was
strange
and
baffling
walt
came
back
in
and
hawk
walked
rapidly
away
walt
went
behind
the
counter
lit
a
cigaret
wiped
at
the
marble
top
picked
up
his
comic
put
it
down
again
and
finally
looked
at
me
he
said
some
punk
busted
fayo
and
a
couple
of
the
boys
it
real
trouble
i
did
say
anything
he
took
a
puff
on
his
cigaret
they
chilled
champ
five
of
them
chilled
dead
it
sounded
bad
there
had
been
a
real
rumble
in
months
not
with
a
killing
he
shook
his
head
not
dead
you
wanting
to
see
you
go
down
cellar
yeah
they
all
stiff
but
they
breathing
i
be
along
soon
as
the
old
man
comes
back
in
the
store
he
looked
pretty
sick
i
left
it
at
that
and
hurried
down
the
block
to
the
tenement
where
the
gomez
family
lived
and
then
i
found
out
why
they
were
sprawled
on
the
filthy
floor
of
the
cellar
like
winoes
in
an
alley
fayo
who
ran
the
gang
jap
baker
two
others
i
did
know
as
well
they
were
breathing
as
walt
had
said
but
you
just
could
wake
them
up
hawk
and
his
twin
brother
yogi
were
there
with
them
looking
scared
i
could
blame
them
the
kids
looked
perfectly
all
right
but
it
was
obvious
that
they
were
i
bent
down
and
smelled
but
there
was
no
trace
of
liquor
or
anything
else
on
their
breath
i
stood
up
we
better
get
a
doctor
nay
you
call
the
meat
wagon
and
a
cop
comes
right
with
it
man
yogi
said
and
his
brother
nodded
i
laid
off
that
for
a
moment
what
happened
hawk
said
you
know
that
witch
gloria
goes
with
one
of
the
boomer
dukes
she
opened
her
big
mouth
to
my
girl
yeah
opened
her
mouth
and
much
bad
talk
came
out
said
fayo
primed
some
jumper
with
a
zip
and
the
punk
cooled
him
and
then
a
couple
of
the
boomers
moved
in
real
cool
now
they
got
the
punk
with
the
zip
and
much
other
stuff
real
stuff
what
kind
of
stuff
hawk
looked
worried
he
finally
admitted
that
he
did
know
what
kind
of
stuff
but
it
was
something
dangerous
in
the
way
of
weapons
it
had
been
the
zip
that
had
knocked
out
the
five
leopards
i
sent
hawk
out
to
the
for
smelling
salts
and
containers
of
hot
black
coffee
not
that
i
knew
what
i
was
doing
of
course
but
they
were
dead
set
against
calling
an
ambulance
and
the
boys
did
seem
to
be
in
any
particular
danger
only
sleep
however
even
then
i
knew
that
this
kind
of
trouble
was
something
i
could
handle
alone
it
was
a
tossup
what
to
do
the
smart
thing
was
to
call
the
precinct
right
then
and
there
but
i
could
help
feeling
that
that
would
make
the
leopards
clam
up
hopelessly
the
six
months
i
had
spent
trying
to
work
with
them
had
not
been
too
successful
a
lot
of
the
other
neighborhood
workers
had
made
a
lot
more
progress
than
i
but
at
least
they
were
willing
to
talk
to
me
and
they
would
talk
to
uniformed
police
besides
as
soon
as
i
had
been
sworn
in
the
day
before
i
had
begun
the
practice
of
carrying
my
at
all
times
as
the
regulations
say
it
was
in
my
coat
there
was
no
reason
for
me
to
feel
i
needed
it
but
i
did
if
there
was
any
truth
to
the
story
of
a
zip
knocking
out
the
boys
and
i
had
all
five
of
them
right
there
for
evidence
i
had
the
unpleasant
conviction
that
there
was
real
trouble
circulating
around
east
harlem
that
afternoon
champ
they
all
waking
up
i
turned
around
and
hawk
was
right
the
five
leopards
all
of
a
sudden
were
stirring
and
opening
their
eyes
maybe
the
smelling
salts
had
something
to
do
with
it
but
i
rather
think
not
we
fed
them
some
of
the
black
coffee
still
reasonably
hot
they
were
scared
they
were
more
scared
than
anything
i
had
ever
seen
in
those
kids
before
they
could
hardly
talk
at
first
and
when
finally
they
came
around
enough
to
tell
me
what
had
happened
i
could
hardly
believe
them
this
man
had
been
small
and
peculiar
and
he
had
been
looking
for
of
all
things
the
mafia
which
he
had
read
about
in
history
books
history
books
well
it
did
make
sense
unless
you
were
prepared
to
make
a
certain
assumption
that
i
refused
to
make
man
from
mars
nonsense
or
from
the
future
equally
ridiculous
then
the
five
leopards
reviving
began
to
walk
around
the
cellar
was
dark
and
dirty
and
packed
with
the
accumulation
of
generations
in
the
way
of
old
furniture
and
mattresses
and
piles
of
newspapers
it
was
surprising
that
we
had
noticed
the
little
gleaming
thing
that
had
apparently
rolled
under
an
abandoned
potbelly
stove
jap
picked
it
up
squalled
dropped
it
and
yelled
for
me
i
touched
it
cautiously
and
it
tingled
it
was
painful
but
it
was
an
odd
unexpected
feeling
perhaps
you
come
across
the
buzzers
that
novelty
stores
sell
which
concealed
in
the
palm
give
a
sudden
surprising
tingle
when
the
owner
shakes
hands
with
an
unsuspecting
friend
it
was
like
that
like
a
mild
electric
shock
i
picked
it
up
and
held
it
it
gleamed
brightly
with
a
light
of
its
own
it
was
round
it
made
a
faint
droning
sound
i
turned
it
over
and
it
spoke
to
me
it
said
in
a
friendly
feminine
whisper
this
portatron
attuned
only
to
bailey
beam
percepts
remain
quiescent
until
the
adjuster
that
settled
it
any
time
a
cue
ball
talks
to
me
i
refer
the
matter
to
higher
authority
i
decided
on
the
spot
that
i
was
heading
for
the
precinct
house
no
matter
what
the
leopards
thought
but
when
i
turned
and
headed
for
the
stairs
i
could
move
my
feet
simply
would
not
lift
off
the
ground
i
twisted
and
stumbled
and
fell
in
a
heap
i
yelled
for
help
but
it
did
do
any
good
the
leopards
could
move
either
we
were
stuck
there
in
gomez
cellar
as
though
we
had
been
nailed
to
the
filthy
floor
iii
cow
when
i
see
what
this
flunky
has
done
to
them
leopards
i
call
him
a
cool
cat
right
away
but
then
we
jump
him
and
he
ai
so
cool
angel
and
tiny
grab
him
under
the
arms
and
i
grabbing
the
stuff
he
carrying
yeah
we
get
out
of
there
there
bulls
on
the
street
so
we
cut
through
the
back
and
over
the
fences
tiny
do
like
that
he
tells
me
cow
what
to
leave
this
cat
here
he
must
weigh
eighteen
tons
you
bringing
him
i
tell
him
so
he
shuts
up
that
how
it
is
in
the
boomer
dukes
when
cow
talks
them
other
flunkies
shut
up
fast
we
get
him
in
the
loft
over
the
and
i
social
club
damn
but
cold
up
there
i
can
hear
the
pool
balls
clicking
down
below
so
i
pass
the
word
to
keep
quiet
then
i
give
this
guy
the
foot
and
pretty
soon
he
wakes
up
as
soon
as
i
talk
to
him
a
little
bit
i
figure
we
had
luck
riding
with
us
when
we
see
them
leopards
this
cat
got
real
bad
stuff
yeah
i
never
hear
of
anything
like
it
but
what
it
takes
to
make
a
fight
got
i
take
my
old
pistol
and
give
it
to
tiny
hell
it
makes
him
happy
and
what
it
cost
me
because
what
this
cat
got
makes
that
pistol
look
like
something
for
babies
first
he
do
want
to
talk
stomp
him
i
tell
angel
but
he
scared

says

of
times

i
make
this
cat
tell
me
what
it
to
do
damn
i
do
know
what
he
talking
about
one
time
out
of
six
but
i
know
enough
even
tiny
catches
on
after
a
while
because
i
see
him
put
down
that
funky
old
pistol
i
gave
him
that
he
been
loving
up
i
feeling
pretty
good
i
wish

he
hands
over

weirdie
i
start
to
pass
out
the
stuff
what
to
do
with
this
stuff
tiny
asks
me
looking
at
what
i
giving
him
i
tell

he
is
listening
when
the
weirdie
telling
me
what

what
it

but
i
do
know
that
i

it
man
i
sent
one
of
the
cats
out
for
drinks
and
smokes
and
he
back
by
then
and
we
all
beginning
to
feel
a
little
better
only
still
pretty
mean
they
begin
to
dig
me
yeah
it
sounds
like
a
rumble
one
of
them
says
after
a
while
i
give
him
the
nod
cool
you
calling
it
i
tell
him
there
much
fighting
tonight
the
boomer
dukes
is
taking
on
the
world
iv
sandy
van
pelt
the
front
office
thought
the
radio
car
would
give
us
a
break
in
spot
news
coverage
and
i
guessed
as
wrong
as
they
did
i
had
been
covering
city
hall
long
enough
and
that
no
place
to
build
a
career
the
press
association
is
very
tight
there
there
not
much
chance
of
getting
any
kind
of
exclusive
story
because
of
the
sharing
agreements
so
i
put
in
for
the
radio
car
it
meant
taking
the
night
shift
but
i
got
it
i
suppose
the
front
office
got
their
money
worth
because
they
played
up
every
lousy
auto
smash
the
radio
car
covered
as
though
it
were
the
story
of
the
second
coming
and
maybe
it
helped
circulation
but
i
had
been
on
it
for
four
months
and
would
you
know
it
there
was
a
decent
murder
or
sewer
explosion
or
running
gun
fight
between
six
and
six
any
night
i
was
on
duty
in
those
whole
four
months
what
made
it
worse
the
kid
they
gave
me
as
photographer
sol
detweiler
his
name
was
could
drive
worth
a
damn
so
i
was
stuck
with
chauffeuring
us
around
we
had
just
been
out
to
laguardia
to
see
if
it
was
true
that
marilyn
monroe
was
sneaking
into
town
with
aly
khan
on
a
night
plane
it
was
and
we
were
coming
across
the
triborough
bridge
heading
south
toward
the
east
river
drive
when
the
office
called
i
pulled
over
and
parked
and
answered
the
radiophone
it
was
harrison
the
night
city
editor
listen
sandy
there
a
gang
fight
in
east
harlem
where
are
you
now
it
did
sound
like
much
to
me
i
admit
there
always
a
gang
fight
in
east
harlem
harrison
i
cold
and
i
on
my
way
down
to
night
court
where
there
may
or
may
not
be
a
story
but
at
least
i
can
get
my
feet
warm
are
you
now
harrison
was
fooling
i
looked
at
sol
on
the
seat
next
to
me
i
thought
i
had
heard
him
snicker
he
began
to
fiddle
with
his
camera
without
looking
at
me
i
pushed
the
talk
button
and
told
harrison
where
i
was
it
pleased
him
very
much
i
was
more
than
six
blocks
from
where
this
big
rumble
was
going
on
he
told
me
and
he
made
it
very
clear
that
i
was
to
get
on
over
there
immediately
i
pulled
away
from
the
curb
wondering
why
i
had
ever
wanted
to
be
a
newspaperman
i
could
have
made
five
times
as
much
money
for
half
as
much
work
in
an
ad
agency
to
make
it
worse
i
heard
sol
chuckle
again
the
reason
he
was
so
amused
was
that
when
we
first
teamed
up
i
made
the
mistake
of
telling
him
what
a
hot
reporter
i
was
and
i
had
been
visibly
cooling
off
before
his
eyes
for
a
better
than
four
straight
months
believe
me
i
was
at
the
very
bottom
of
my
career
that
night
for
five
cents
cash
i
would
have
parked
the
car
thrown
the
keys
in
the
east
river
and
taken
the
first
bus
out
of
town
i
was
absolutely
positive
that
the
story
would
be
a
bust
and
all
i
would
get
out
of
it
would
be
a
bad
cold
from
walking
around
in
the
snow
and
if
that
does
show
you
what
a
hot
newspaperman
i
really
am
nothing
will
sol
began
to
act
interested
as
we
reached
the
corner
harrison
had
told
us
to
go
to
that
chris
he
said
pointing
at
a
little
candy
store
and
that
must
be
the
pool
hall
where
the
leopards
hang
out
you
know
this
place
he
nodded
i
know
a
man
named
walter
hutner
he
and
i
went
to
school
together
until
he
dropped
out
couple
weeks
ago
he
quit
college
to
go
to
the
police
academy
he
wanted
to
be
a
cop
i
looked
at
him
you
going
to
college
sure
van
pelt
wally
hutner
was
a
sociology
major
journalism
but
we
had
a
couple
of
classes
together
he
had
a
job
with
a
neighborhood
council
up
here
acting
as
a
sort
of
adult
adviser
for
one
of
the
gangs
they
need
advice
on
how
to
be
gangs
no
that
not
it
van
pelt
the
councils
try
to
get
their
workers
accepted
enough
to
bring
the
kids
in
to
the
social
centers
that
all
they
try
to
get
them
off
the
streets
wally
was
working
with
a
bunch
called
the
leopards
i
shut
him
up
tell
me
about
it
later
i
stopped
the
car
and
rolled
down
a
window
listening
yes
there
was
something
going
on
all
right
not
at
the
corner
harrison
had
mentioned
there
was
a
soul
in
sight
in
any
direction
but
i
could
hear
what
sounded
like
gunfire
and
yelling
and
my
god
even
bombs
going
off
and
it
was
too
far
away
there
were
sirens
too
squad
cars
no
doubt
it
over
that
way
sol
yelled
pointing
he
looked
as
though
he
was
having
the
time
of
his
life
all
keyed
up
and
delighted
he
did
have
to
tell
me
where
the
noise
was
coming
from
i
could
hear
for
myself
it
sounded
like
at
normandy
and
i
did
like
the
sound
of
it
i
made
a
quick
decision
and
slammed
on
the
brakes
then
backed
the
car
back
the
way
we
had
come
sol
looked
at
me
what
local
color
i
explained
quickly
this
the
place
you
were
talking
about
chris
let
go
in
and
see
if
we
can
find
some
of
these
hoodlums
but
van
pelt
all
the
pictures
are
over
where
the
fight
going
on
pictures
shmictures
come
on
i
got
out
in
front
of
the
candy
store
and
the
only
thing
he
could
do
was
follow
me
whatever
they
were
doing
they
were
making
the
devil
own
racket
about
it
now
that
i
looked
a
little
more
closely
i
could
see
that
they
must
have
come
this
way
the
candy
store
windows
were
broken
every
other
street
light
was
smashed
and
what
had
at
first
looked
like
a
flight
of
steps
in
front
of
a
tenement
across
the
street
was
anything
of
the
kind
it
was
a
pile
of
bricks
and
stone
from
the
cornice
on
the
roof
how
in
the
world
they
had
managed
to
knock
that
down
i
had
no
idea
but
it
sort
of
convinced
me
that
after
all
harrison
had
been
right
about
this
being
a
fight
over
where
the
noise
was
coming
from
there
were
queer
flashing
lights
in
the
clouds
overhead
reflecting
exploding
flares
i
thought
no
i
did
want
to
go
over
where
the
pictures
were
i
like
living
if
it
had
been
a
normal
harlem
rumble
with
broken
bottles
and
knives
or
maybe
even
zip
guns
i
might
have
taken
a
chance
on
it
but
this
was
for
real
come
on
i
yelled
to
sol
and
we
pushed
the
door
open
to
the
candy
store
at
first
there
did
seem
to
be
anyone
in
but
after
we
called
a
couple
times
a
kid
of
about
sixteen
and
stuck
his
head
up
above
the
counter
you
what
going
on
here
i
demanded
he
looked
at
me
as
if
i
was
some
kind
of
a
monster
come
on
kid
tell
us
what
happened
excuse
me
van
pelt
sol
cut
in
ahead
of
me
and
began
talking
to
the
kid
in
spanish
it
got
a
rise
out
of
him
at
least
sol
got
an
answer
my
spanish
is
only
a
little
bit
better
than
my
swahili
so
i
missed
what
was
going
on
except
for
an
occasional
word
but
sol
was
getting
it
all
he
reported
he
knows
walt
that
what
bothering
him
he
says
walt
and
some
of
the
leopards
are
in
a
basement
down
the
street
and
there
something
wrong
with
them
i
ca
exactly
figure
out
what
but
the
hell
with
them
what
about
you
mean
the
fight
oh
it
a
big
one
all
right
van
pelt
it
a
gang
called
the
boomer
dukes
they
got
hold
of
some
real
guns
somewhere
i
ca
exactly
understand
what
kind
of
guns
he
means
but
it
sounds
like
something
serious
he
says
they
shot
that
parapet
down
across
the
street
gosh
van
pelt
you
think
it
take
a
cannon
for
something
like
that
but
it
has
something
to
do
with
walt
hutner
and
all
the
leopards
too
i
said
enthusiastically
very
good
sol
that
fine
find
out
where
the
cellar
is
and
we
go
interview
hutner
but
van
pelt
the
pictures
sorry
i
have
to
call
the
office
i
turned
my
back
on
him
and
headed
for
the
car
the
noise
was
louder
and
the
flashes
in
the
sky
brighter
it
looked
as
though
they
were
moving
this
way
well
i
did
have
any
money
tied
up
in
the
car
so
i
was
worried
about
leaving
it
in
the
street
and
somebody
cellar
seemed
like
a
very
good
place
to
be
i
called
the
office
and
started
to
tell
harrison
what
we
found
out
but
he
stopped
me
short
sandy
where
you
been
i
been
trying
to
call
you
for
listen
we
got
a
call
from
fordham
they
detected
radiation
coming
from
the
east
side
it
got
to
be
what
going
on
up
there
radiation
do
you
hear
me
that
means
atomic
weapons
now
you
get
th
silence
hello
i
cried
and
then
remembered
to
push
the
talk
button
hello
harrison
you
there
silence
the
radio
was
dead
i
got
out
of
the
car
and
maybe
i
understood
what
had
happened
to
the
radio
and
maybe
i
did
anyway
there
was
something
new
shining
in
the
sky
it
hung
below
the
clouds
in
parts
and
i
could
see
it
through
the
bottom
of
the
clouds
in
the
middle
it
was
a
silvery
teacup
upside
down
a
hemisphere
over
everything
it
had
been
there
two
minutes
before
i
heard
firing
coming
closer
and
closer
around
a
corner
a
bunch
of
cops
came
running
turning
firing
running
turning
and
firing
again
it
was
like
the
retreat
from
caporetto
in
miniature
and
what
was
chasing
them
in
a
minute
i
saw
coming
around
the
corner
was
a
kid
with
a
satin
jacket
and
two
guns
in
his
hand
there
was
a
silvery
aura
around
him
the
same
color
as
the
lights
in
the
sky
and
i
swear
i
saw
those
cops
guns
hit
him
twenty
times
in
twenty
seconds
but
he
did
seem
to
notice
sol
and
the
kid
from
the
candy
store
were
right
beside
me
we
took
another
look
at
the
army
that
was
coming
down
the
street
toward
us
laughing
and
prancing
and
firing
those
guns
and
then
the
three
of
us
got
out
of
there
heading
for
the
cellar
any
cellar
v
priam
maw
my
occupation
was
cook
as
it
is
called
i
practiced
it
in
a
locus
entitled
the
white
heaven
established
at
fifth
avenue
newyork
between
and
i
had
created
rapport
with
several
of
the
aboriginals
who
addressed
me
as
bessie
and
presumed
to
approve
the
manner
in
which
i
heated
specimens
of
minced
ruminant
quadruped
flesh
deceased
to
be
sure
it
was
a
satisfactory
guise
although
tiring
illustration
using
approved
techniques
i
was
compiling
anthropometric
data
while
i
was
as
they
say
brewing
coffee
i
deem
the
probability
nearly
conclusive
that
it
was
the
double
duty
plus
the
datum
that
as
stated
i
was
physically
tired
which
caused
me
to
overlook
the
first
signal
from
my
portatron
indeed
i
might
have
overlooked
the
second
as
well
except
that
the
aboriginal
named
lester
stated
hey
bessie
ya
got
an
alarm
clock
in
ya
pocketbook
he
had
related
the
annunciator
signal
of
the
portatron
to
the
only
significant
datum
in
his
own
experience
which
it
resembled
the
ringing
of
a
bell
i
annotated
his
dossier
to
provide
for
his
removal
in
case
it
eventuated
that
he
had
made
an
undesirable
intuit
this
proved
unnecessary
and
retired
to
the
back
of
the
store
with
my
on
identifying
myself
to
the
portatron
i
received
information
that
it
was
attuned
to
a
bailey
beam
identified
as
foraminifera
who
had
refused
treatment
for
systemic
weltschmerz
and
instead
sought
to
relieve
his
boredom
by
adventuring
into
this
era
i
thereupon
compiled
two
recommendations
which
are
attached
a
proposal
for
reprimand
to
the
keeper
of
the
learning
lodge
for
failure
to
properly
annotate
a
volume
entitled
and
a
proposal
for
reprimand
to
the
transport
executive
for
permitting
bailey
personnel
access
to
temporal
transport
meanwhile
i
left
the
store
by
a
rear
exit
and
directed
myself
toward
the
locus
of
the
transmitting
portatron
i
had
proximately
left
when
i
received
an
additional
information
namely
that
developed
weapons
were
being
employed
in
the
area
toward
which
i
was
directing
this
provoked
that
i
abandon
guise
entirely
i
went
transparent
and
quickly
examined
all
aboriginals
within
view
to
determine
if
any
required
removal
but
none
had
observed
this
i
rose
to
perhaps
meters
and
sped
at
full
atmospheric
driving
speed
toward
the
source
of
the
alarm
as
i
crossed
a
park
i
detected
the
drive
of
another
adjuster
whom
i
determined
to
be
alephplex
maw
that
is
my
father
he
bespoke
me
as
follows
hurry
besplex
priam
maw
that
crazy
foraminifera
has
been
captured
by
aboriginals
and
they
have
taken
his
weapons
away
from
him
weapons
i
inquired
yes
weapons
he
stated
for
foraminifera
brought
with
him
more
than
kilograms
of
weapons
ranging
up
to
and
including
electronic
i
recorded
this
datum
and
we
landed
went
opaque
in
the
shelter
of
a
doorway
and
examined
our
percepts
quarantine
asked
my
father
and
i
had
to
agree
quarantine
i
voted
and
he
opened
his
and
a
quarantine
shield
on
the
console
at
once
appeared
the
silvery
quarantine
dome
and
the
first
step
of
our
adjustment
was
completed
now
to
isolate
remove
replace
queried
alephplex
an
adjuster
i
observed
the
phenomenon
to
which
he
was
referring
a
young
dark
aboriginal
was
coming
toward
us
on
the
street
driving
a
group
of
police
aboriginals
before
him
he
was
armed
it
appeared
with
a
weapon
in
one
hand
and
some
sort
of
tranquilizer
i
deem
it
to
have
been
a
stollgratz
in
the
other
moreover
he
wore
an
invulnerability
belt
the
police
aboriginals
were
attempting
to
strike
him
with
missile
weapons
which
the
belt
deflected
i
neutralized
his
shield
collapsed
him
and
stored
him
in
my
not
an
adjuster
i
asserted
my
father
but
he
had
already
perceived
that
this
was
so
i
left
him
to
neutralize
and
collapse
the
police
aboriginals
while
i
zeroed
in
on
the
portatron
i
did
not
envy
him
his
job
with
the
police
aboriginals
for
many
of
them
were
dead
as
they
say
it
required
the
most
delicate
adjustments
the
portatron
developed
to
be
in
a
cellar
and
with
it
were
some
nine
or
eleven
aboriginals
which
it
had
immobilized
pending
my
arrival
one
spoke
to
me
thus
young
lady
please
call
the
cops
we
stuck
here
and
i
did
not
wait
to
hear
what
he
wished
to
say
further
but
neutralized
and
collapsed
him
with
the
other
aboriginals
the
portatron
apologized
for
having
caused
me
inconvenience
but
of
course
it
was
not
its
fault
so
i
did
not
neutralize
it
using
it
for
i
quickly
located
the
culprit
foraminifera
bailey
beam
nearby
he
spoke
despairingly
in
the
dialect
of
the
locus
besplex
priam
maw
for
god
sake
get
me
out
of
this
out
i
spoke
to
him
you
wish
you
never
were
as
they
say
i
neutralized
but
did
not
collapse
him
pending
instructions
from
the
central
authority
the
aboriginals
who
were
with
him
however
i
did
collapse
presently
arrived
alephplex
along
with
four
other
adjusters
who
had
arrived
before
the
quarantine
shield
made
it
not
possible
for
anyone
else
to
enter
the
disturbed
area
each
one
of
us
had
had
to
abandon
guise
so
that
this
locus
of
newyork
must
require
new
adjusters
to
replace
us
a
matter
to
be
charged
against
the
guilt
of
foraminifera
bailey
beam
i
deem
this
concluded
steps
and
of
our
adjustment
the
removal
and
the
isolation
of
the
disturbed
specimens
we
are
transmitting
same
disturbed
specimens
to
you
under
separate
cover
herewith
in
neutralized
and
collapsed
state
for
the
manufacture
of
simulacra
thereof
one
regrets
to
say
that
they
number
three
thousand
eight
hundred
comprising
all
aboriginals
within
the
quarantined
area
who
had
knowledge
of
the
anachronisms
caused
by
importation
of
contemporary
weapons
into
this
locus
alephplex
and
the
four
other
adjusters
are
at
present
reconstructing
such
physical
damage
as
was
caused
by
the
use
of
said
weapons
simultaneously
while
i
am
preparing
this
report
i
am
maintaining
the
quarantine
shield
which
cuts
off
this
locus
both
physically
and
temporally
from
the
remainder
of
its
environment
i
deem
that
if
replacements
for
the
attached
aboriginals
can
be
fabricated
quickly
enough
there
will
be
no
significant
outside
percept
of
the
shield
itself
or
of
the
happenings
within
it
that
is
by
maintaining
a
of
time
while
the
repairs
are
being
made
an
outside
aboriginal
observer
will
see
at
most
a
mere
flicker
of
silver
in
the
sky
all
adjusters
here
present
are
working
as
rapidly
as
we
can
to
make
sure
the
shield
can
be
withdrawn
before
so
many
aboriginals
have
observed
it
as
to
make
it
necessary
to
replace
the
entire
city
with
simulacra
we
do
not
wish
a
repetition
of
the
california
incident
