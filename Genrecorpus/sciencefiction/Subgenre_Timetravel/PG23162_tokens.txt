the

no

i
dipped
through
the
filmy
curtain
into
the
boys
half
of
the
dressing
room
and
there
was
sid
sitting
at
the
star
dressing
table
in
his
threadbare
yellowed
undershirt
the
lucky
one
not
making
up
yet
but
staring
sternly
at
himself
in
the
mirror
and
experimentally
working
his
features
a
little
as
actors
will
and
kneading
the
stubble
on
his
fat
chin
i
said
to
him
quietly
siddy
what
are
we
putting
on
tonight
maxwell
anderson
the
or
shakespeare
it
says
on
the
callboard
but
miss
nefer
getting
ready
for
elizabeth
she
just
had
me
go
and
fetch
the
red
wig
he
tried
out
a
few
eyebrow
rears
right
left
both
together
then
turned
to
me
sucking
in
his
big
gut
a
little
as
he
always
does
when
a
gal
heaves
into
hailing
distance
and
said
your
pardon
sweetling
what
sayest
thou
sid
always
uses
that
kook
antique
patter
backstage
until
i
sometimes
wonder
whether
i
in
central
park
new
york
city
nineteen
hundred
and
three
quarters
or
somewhere
in
southwark
merry
england
fifteen
hundred
and
same
the
truth
is
that
although
he
loves
every
last
fat
part
in
shakespeare
and
will
play
the
skinniest
one
with
loyal
and
inspired
affection
he
thinks
willy
penned
falstaff
with
nobody
else
in
mind
but
sidney
lessingham
and
no
accent
on
the
ham
please
i
closed
my
eyes
and
counted
to
eight
then
repeated
my
question
he
replied
why
the
bard
tragical
history
of
the
bloody
scot
certes
he
waved
his
hand
toward
the
portrait
of
shakespeare
that
always
sits
beside
his
mirror
on
top
of
his
reserve
makeup
box
at
first
that
particular
picture
of
the
bard
looked
too
nancy
to
me
a
sort
of
schoolteacher
but
i
grown
used
to
it
over
the
months
and
even
he
did
ask
me
why
i
had
asked
miss
nefer
my
question
everybody
in
the
company
knows
she
spends
the
hour
before
getting
into
character
never
parting
her
lips
except
for
that
purpose
or
to
bite
your
head
off
if
you
try
to
make
the
most
necessary
conversation
aye
tonight
sid
confirmed
returning
to
his
left
eyebrow
up
right
down
reverse
repeat
rest
and
i
must
play
the
thane
of
glamis
i
said
that
fine
siddy
but
where
does
it
leave
us
with
miss
nefer
she
already
thinned
her
eyebrows
and
beaked
out
the
top
of
her
nose
for
queen
liz
though
that
as
far
as
she
got
a
beautiful
job
the
nose
anybody
else
would
think
it
was
plastic
surgery
instead
of
putty
but
it
going
to
look
kind
of
funny
on
the
thaness
of
glamis
sid
hesitated
a
half
second
longer
than
he
usually
would
i
thought
timing
off
and
then
he
harrumphed
and
said
why
iris
nefer
decked
out
as
good
queen
bess
will
speak
a
prologue
to
the
play
a
prologue
which
i
have
myself
but
last
week
writ
he
owled
his
eyes
is
an
experiment
in
the
new
theater
i
said
siddy
prologues
were
nothing
new
to
shakespeare
he
had
them
on
half
his
other
plays
besides
it
does
make
sense
to
use
queen
elizabeth
she
was
dead
by
the
time
he
whipped
up
which
is
all
about
witchcraft
and
directed
at
king
james
he
growled
a
little
at
me
and
demanded
prithee
how
comes
it
your
bears
such
a
ballast
of
fusty
chit
i
said
softly
siddy
you
do
camp
in
a
shakespearean
dressing
room
for
a
year
with
some
of
the
wisest
actors
ever
without
learning
a
little
sure
i
a
mental
case
a
poor
little
a
a
existing
on
your
sweet
charity
and
do
think
i
do
appreciate
it
but
thou
sayest
he
frowned
methinks
the
gladsome
new
forswearers
of
sack
and
ale
call
themselves
aa
agoraphobe
and
amnesiac
i
told
him
but
look
siddy
i
was
going
to
sayest
that
i
do
know
the
plays
having
queen
elizabeth
speak
a
prologue
to
is
as
much
an
anachronism
as
if
you
put
her
on
the
gantry
of
the
british
moonship
busting
a
bottle
of
champagne
over
its
schnozzle
ha
he
cried
as
if
he
caught
me
out
and
saying
there
a
new
elizabeth
would
that
be
the
bravest
advertisement
ever
for
the
empire
perchance
rechristening
the
pilot
copilot
and
astrogator
drake
hawkins
and
raleigh
and
the
ship
golden
tilly
fally
lady
he
went
on
my
prologue
an
anachronism
quotha
the
groundlings
will
never
mark
it
thou
wisdom
came
to
mankind
with
the
stenchful
rocket
and
the
sundered
atomy
more
the
bard
himself
was
topfull
of
anachronism
he
put
spectacles
on
king
lear
had
clocks
tolling
the
hour
in
caesar
rome
buried
that
roman
o
burning
him
and
gave
czechoslovakia
a
seacoast
go
to
doll
czechoslovakia
siddy
bohemia
then
what
skills
it
leave
me
now
sweet
poppet
go
thy
ways
i
have
matters
of
import
to
ponder
there
more
to
running
a
repertory
company
than
reading
the
footnotes
to
furness
martin
had
just
slouched
by
calling
the
half
hour
and
looking
in
his
solemnity
sneakers
levis
and
dirty
more
like
an
underage
refugee
from
skid
row
than
sid
newest
recruit
assistant
stage
manager
and
juvenile
though
for
once
he
remembered
to
shave
i
was
about
to
ask
sid
who
was
going
to
play
lady
mack
if
miss
nefer
was
or
if
she
were
going
to
double
the
roles
should
i
help
her
with
the
change
she
a
slow
dresser
and
the
elizabeth
costumes
are
pretty
realistically
stayed
and
she
would
have
trouble
getting
off
that
nose
i
was
sure
but
then
i
saw
that
siddy
was
already
slapping
on
the
alboline
to
keep
the
grease
paint
from
getting
into
his
pores
you
ask
too
many
i
told
myself
get
everybody
riled
up
and
you
rack
your
own
poor
ricketty
little
and
i
hied
myself
off
to
the
costumery
to
settle
my
nerves
the
costumery
which
occupies
the
back
end
of
the
dressing
room
is
exactly
the
right
place
to
settle
the
nerves
and
warm
the
fancies
of
any
child
including
an
unraveled
adult
who
saving
what
left
of
her
sanity
by
pretending
to
be
one
to
begin
with
there
are
the
regular
costumes
for
shakespeare
plays
all
jeweled
and
spangled
and
brocaded
stage
armor
great
roman
togas
with
weights
in
the
borders
to
make
them
drape
right
velvets
of
every
color
to
rest
your
cheek
against
and
dream
and
the
fantastic
costumes
for
the
other
plays
we
favor
ibsen
shaw
to
and
hilliard
adaptation
of
heinlein
of
the
capek
brothers
of
the
beggar
of
road
to
there
are
also
the
costumes
for
all
the
special
and
variety
performances
we
give
of
the
plays
in
modern
dress
set
in
a
dictatorship
of
the
taming
of
the
in
caveman
furs
and
leopard
skins
where
petruchio
comes
in
riding
a
dinosaur
set
on
another
planet
with
a
spaceship
wreck
to
start
it
off
which
means
a
half
dozen
spacesuits
featherweight
but
looking
ever
so
practical
and
the
weirdest
sort
of
outfits
for
ariel
and
caliban
and
the
other
monsters
oh
i
tell
you
the
stuff
in
the
costumery
ranges
over
such
a
sweep
of
space
and
time
that
you
sometimes
get
frightened
you
be
whirled
up
and
spun
off
just
anywhere
so
that
you
have
to
clutch
at
something
very
real
to
you
to
keep
it
from
happening
and
to
remind
you
where
you
are
as
i
did
now
at
the
subway
token
on
the
thin
gold
chain
around
my
neck
siddy
first
gift
to
me
that
i
can
remember
and
chanted
very
softly
to
myself
like
a
charm
or
a
prayer
closing
my
eyes
and
squeezing
the
holes
in
the
token
columbus
circle
times
square
penn
station
christopher
street
but
you
do
ever
get
frightened
in
the
costumery
not
exactly
though
your
goosehairs
get
wonderfully
realistically
tingled
and
your
tummy
chilled
from
time
to
time
because
you
know
it
all
a
lifesize
doll
world
a
children
world
it
gets
you
thinking
of
times
and
scenes
as
places
and
not
as
black
hungry
mouths
that
might
gobble
you
up
and
keep
you
forever
it
always
safe
always
in
the
theatre
just
on
the
no
matter
how
far
it
seems
to
plunge
and
roam
and
the
best
sort
of
therapy
for
a
mind
like
mine
with
as
many
gray
ruts
and
curves
and
gaps
as
its
cerebrum
that
ca
remember
one
single
thing
before
this
last
year
in
the
dressing
room
and
that
ca
ever
push
its
shaking
body
out
of
that
same
motherly
fatherly
room
except
to
stand
in
the
wings
for
a
scene
or
two
and
watch
the
play
until
the
fear
gets
too
great
and
the
urge
to
take
just
one
peek
at
gets
too
strong
and
i
remember
what
happened
the
two
times
i
peek
and
i
have
to
come
scuttling
back
the
costumery
good
occupational
therapy
for
me
too
as
my
pricked
and
calloused
fingertips
testify
i
think
i
must
have
stitched
up
or
darned
half
the
costumes
in
it
this
last
twelvemonth
though
there
are
so
many
of
them
that
i
swear
the
drawers
have
accordion
pleats
and
the
racks
extend
into
the
fourth
dimension
not
to
mention
the
boxes
of
props
and
the
shelves
of
scripts
and
and
other
books
including
a
couple
of
encyclopedias
and
the
many
thick
volumes
of
furness
which
as
sid
had
guessed
i
been
boning
up
on
oh
and
i
sponged
and
pressed
enough
costumes
too
and
even
refitted
them
to
newcomers
like
martin
ripping
up
and
resewing
seams
which
can
be
a
punishing
job
with
heavy
materials
in
a
less
sloppily
organized
company
i
be
called
wardrobe
mistress
i
guess
except
that
to
anyone
in
show
business
that
suggests
a
crotchety
old
dame
with
lots
of
authority
and
scissors
hanging
around
her
neck
on
a
string
although
i
got
my
crochets
all
right
i
not
that
old
kind
of
childish
in
fact
as
for
authority
everybody
outranks
me
even
martin
of
course
to
somebody
show
business
wardrobe
mistress
might
suggest
a
yummy
gal
who
spends
her
time
dressing
up
as
nell
gwyn
or
anitra
or
pinchwife
or
cleopatra
or
even
eve
we
got
a
legal
costume
for
it
and
inspiring
the
boys
i
tried
that
once
or
twice
but
siddy
frowns
on
it
and
if
miss
nefer
ever
caught
me
at
it
i
think
she
whang
me
and
in
a
normaller
company
it
would
be
the
wardrobe
room
too
but
costumery
is
my
infantile
name
for
it
and
the
actors
go
along
with
my
little
whims
i
do
mean
to
suggest
our
company
is
completely
crackers
to
get
as
close
to
broadway
even
as
central
park
you
got
to
have
something
but
in
spite
of
sid
there
is
a
comforting
looseness
about
its
efficiency
people
trade
around
the
parts
they
play
without
fuss
the
bill
may
be
changed
a
half
hour
before
curtain
without
anybody
getting
hysterics
nobody
gets
fired
for
eating
garlic
and
breathing
it
in
the
leading
lady
face
in
short
we
a
team
which
is
funny
when
you
come
to
think
of
it
as
sid
and
miss
nefer
and
bruce
and
maudie
are
british
miss
nefer
with
a
touch
of
eurasian
blood
i
romance
martin
and
beau
and
me
are
american
at
least
i
i
am
while
the
rest
come
from
just
everywhere
besides
my
costumery
work
i
fetch
things
and
run
inside
errands
and
help
the
actresses
dress
and
the
actors
too
the
dressing
room
very
coeducational
in
a
halfway
respectable
way
and
every
once
in
a
while
martin
and
i
police
up
the
whole
place
me
skittering
about
with
dustcloth
and
wastebasket
he
wielding
the
and
mop
with
such
silent
grim
efficiency
that
it
always
makes
me
nervous
to
get
through
and
duck
back
into
the
costumery
to
collect
myself
yes
the
costumery
a
great
place
to
quiet
your
nerves
or
improve
your
mind
or
even
dream
your
life
away
but
this
time
i
could
have
been
there
eight
minutes
when
miss
nefer
voice
came
skirling
girl
girl
greta
where
is
my
ruff
with
silver
trim
i
laid
my
hands
on
it
in
a
flash
and
loped
it
to
her
because
old
queen
liz
was
known
to
slap
even
her
maids
of
honor
around
a
bit
now
and
then
and
miss
nefer
is
a
bear
on
getting
into
character
a
real
paul
muni
she
was
all
made
up
now
i
was
happy
to
note
at
least
as
far
as
her
face
went
i
hate
to
see
that
spooky
faint
tattoo
on
her
forehead
i
sometimes
wondered
if
she
got
it
acting
in
india
or
egypt
maybe
yes
she
was
already
all
made
up
this
time
she
been
going
extra
heavy
on
the
bit
i
could
tell
right
away
even
if
it
was
only
for
a
anachronistic
prologue
she
signed
to
me
to
help
her
dress
without
even
looking
at
me
but
as
i
got
busy
i
looked
at
eyes
they
were
so
cold
and
sad
and
lonely
maybe
because
they
were
so
far
away
from
her
eyebrows
and
temples
and
small
tight
mouth
and
so
shut
away
from
each
other
by
that
ridge
of
nose
that
i
got
the
creeps
then
she
began
to
murmur
and
sigh
very
softly
at
first
then
loudly
enough
so
i
got
the
sense
of
it
cold
so
cold
she
said
still
seeing
things
far
away
though
her
hands
were
working
smoothly
with
mine
even
a
gallop
hardly
fires
my
blood
never
was
such
a
januarius
though
there
no
snow
snow
will
not
come
or
tears
yet
my
brain
burns
with
the
thought
of
unsigned
there
my
particular
hell
to
doom
perchance
all
future
queens
or
leave
a
hole
for
the
spaniard
and
the
pope
to
creep
like
old
worms
back
into
the
sweet
apple
of
england
philip
tall
black
crooked
ships
massing
like
fortresses
cragged
castles
set
to
march
into
the
waves
parma
in
the
lowlands
and
all
the
while
my
bright
young
idiot
gentlemen
spurting
out
my
treasure
as
if
it
were
so
much
water
as
if
gold
pieces
were
a
glut
of
summer
posies
oh
alackanight
and
i
thought
iced
that
sure
going
to
be
one
tyrannosaur
of
a
prologue
and
how
you
ever
shift
back
to
being
lady
mack
beats
me
greta
if
this
is
what
it
takes
to
do
just
a
bit
part
better
give
up
your
secret
ambition
of
playing
some
day
when
your
nerves
she
was
really
getting
to
me
you
see
with
that
characterization
it
was
as
if
i
managed
to
go
out
and
take
a
walk
and
sat
down
in
the
park
outside
and
heard
the
president
talking
to
himself
about
the
chances
of
war
with
russia
and
realized
he
sat
down
on
a
bench
with
its
back
to
mine
and
only
a
bush
between
you
see
here
we
were
two
females
undignifiedly
twisted
together
at
the
moment
getting
her
into
that
crazy
bodice
that
like
a
big
icecream
cone
and
yet
here
at
the
same
time
was
queen
elizabeth
the
first
of
england
three
hundred
and
years
dead
coming
back
to
life
in
a
central
park
dressing
room
it
shook
me
she
looked
so
much
the
part
you
see
even
without
the
red
wig
yet
just
powdered
pale
makeup
going
back
to
a
quarter
of
an
inch
from
her
own
short
dark
bang
combed
and
netted
back
tight
the
age
too
miss
nefer
ca
be
a
day
over
forty
well
at
most
but
now
she
looked
and
talked
and
felt
to
my
hands
dressing
her
well
at
least
a
dozen
years
older
i
guess
when
miss
nefer
gets
into
character
she
does
it
with
each
molecule
that
age
point
fascinated
me
so
much
that
i
risked
asking
her
a
question
probably
i
was
figuring
that
she
could
do
me
much
damage
because
of
the
positions
we
happened
to
be
in
at
the
moment
you
see
i
started
to
lace
her
up
and
to
do
it
right
i
had
my
knee
against
the
tail
of
her
spine
how
old
i
mean
how
young
might
your
majesty
be
i
asked
her
innocently
wonderingly
like
some
dumb
serving
wench
for
a
wonder
she
did
somehow
swing
around
and
clout
me
but
only
settled
into
character
a
little
more
deeply
winters
she
replied
dismally
januarius
of
our
lord
year
one
thousand
and
five
hundred
and
eighty
and
seven
i
sit
cold
in
greenwich
staring
at
the
table
where
mary
death
warrant
waits
only
my
sign
manual
if
i
send
her
to
the
block
i
open
the
doors
to
future
less
official
regicides
but
if
i
doom
her
not
philip
armada
will
come
inching
up
the
channel
in
a
season
puffing
smoke
and
shot
and
my
english
catholics
thinking
only
of
mary
regina
will
rise
and
i
the
end
the
spaniard
will
have
all
all
history
would
alter
that
must
not
be
even
if
i
damned
for
it
and
yet
and
yet
a
bright
blue
fly
came
buzzing
along
the
dressing
room
has
insect
life
and
slowly
circled
her
head
rather
close
but
she
even
flicker
her
eyelids
i
sit
cold
in
greenwich
going
mad
each
afternoon
i
ride
praying
for
some
mischance
some
prodigy
to
wash
from
my
mind
away
the
bloody
question
for
some
little
space
it
skills
not
what
a
fire
a
tree
davison
or
eyes
leicester
tumbled
with
his
horse
an
assassin
ball
clipping
the
cold
twigs
by
my
ear
a
maid
crying
rape
a
wild
boar
charging
with
dipping
tusks
news
of
the
spaniard
at
thames
mouth
or
more
happily
a
band
of
strolling
actors
setting
forth
some
new
comedy
to
charm
the
fancy
or
some
great
tragedy
to
tear
the
heart
though
that
were
somewhat
much
to
hope
for
at
this
season
and
place
even
if
southwark
be
close
by
the
lacing
was
done
i
stood
back
from
her
and
really
she
looked
so
much
like
elizabeth
painted
by
gheeraerts
or
on
the
great
seal
of
ireland
or
something
though
the
plush
dress
trimmed
in
silver
and
the
little
ruff
and
the
cloak
lined
with
white
plush
hanging
behind
her
looked
most
like
a
winter
riding
costume
and
her
face
was
such
a
pale
frozen
mask
of
elizabeth
inward
tortures
that
i
told
myself
i
got
to
talk
to
siddy
again
he
made
some
big
mistake
the
lardy
old
lackwit
miss
nefer
just
ca
be
figuring
on
playing
in
macbeth
as
a
matter
of
fact
i
was
nerving
myself
to
ask
all
about
it
direct
though
it
was
going
to
take
some
real
nerve
and
maybe
be
risking
broken
bones
or
at
least
a
flayed
cheek
to
break
the
ice
of
that
characterization
when
who
should
come
by
calling
the
fifteen
minutes
but
martin
he
looked
so
downright
goofy
that
it
took
my
mind
off
for
all
of
eight
seconds
his
levied
bottom
half
still
looked
like
lower
martin
is
village
stanislavsky
rather
than
ye
olde
english
stage
traditions
but
above
that
well
all
it
really
amounted
to
was
that
he
was
stripped
to
the
waist
and
had
shaved
off
the
small
high
tuft
of
chest
hair
and
was
wearing
a
black
wig
that
hung
down
in
front
of
his
shoulders
in
two
big
braids
heavy
with
silver
hoops
and
pins
but
just
the
same
those
simple
things
along
with
his
tan
and
habitual
poker
expression
made
him
look
so
like
an
american
indian
that
i
thought
zeus
he
all
set
to
play
hiawatha
or
if
just
cover
up
that
chest
a
frowny
and
i
quick
ran
through
what
plays
with
indian
parts
we
do
and
could
only
come
up
with
i
mutely
goggled
my
question
at
him
wiggling
my
hands
like
guppy
fins
but
he
brushed
me
off
with
a
solemn
mysterious
smile
and
backed
through
the
curtain
i
thought
can
explain
this
but
and
i
followed
martin
ii
history
does
not
move
in
one
current
like
the
wind
across
bare
seas
but
in
a
thousand
streams
and
eddies
like
the
wind
over
a
broken
landscape
cary
the
boys
half
of
the
dressing
room
really
was
bustling
there
was
the
smell
of
spirit
gum
and
max
factor
and
just
plain
men
several
guys
were
getting
dressed
or
and
bruce
was
cussing
because
he
just
burnt
his
fingers
unwinding
from
the
neck
of
a
hot
electric
bulb
some
crepe
hair
he
wound
there
to
dry
after
wetting
and
stretching
it
to
turn
it
from
crinkly
to
straight
for
his
banquo
beard
bruce
is
always
getting
to
the
theater
late
and
trying
shortcuts
but
i
had
eyes
only
for
sid
so
help
me
as
soon
as
i
saw
him
they
bugged
again
i
told
myself
going
to
have
to
send
martin
out
to
the
drugstore
for
some
the
roaches
boy
for
the
sid
was
made
up
and
had
his
long
mustaches
and
macbeth
wig
on
and
his
corset
too
i
could
tell
by
the
way
his
waist
was
sucked
in
before
he
saw
me
but
instead
of
dark
kilts
and
that
leather
battle
harness
that
lets
him
show
off
his
beefy
shoulders
and
the
top
half
of
his
heavily
furred
chest
and
which
really
does
look
great
on
macbeth
in
the
first
act
when
he
comes
in
straight
from
battle
but
instead
of
that
he
was
wearing
so
help
me
red
tights
with
strips
of
a
green
doublet
and
to
top
it
a
ruff
and
he
was
trying
to
fit
onto
his
front
a
bright
silvered
cuirass
that
would
have
looked
just
dandy
maybe
on
one
of
the
pope
swiss
guards
i
thought
willy
ought
to
reach
out
of
his
portrait
there
and
bop
you
one
on
the
koko
for
contemplating
such
a
desecration
of
just
about
his
greatest
and
certainly
his
most
atmospheric
just
then
he
noticed
me
and
hissed
accusingly
there
thou
art
slothy
minx
spring
to
and
help
stuff
me
into
this
monstrous
siddy
what
all
this
i
demanded
as
my
hands
automatically
obeyed
are
you
going
to
play
for
laughs
except
maybe
leaving
the
porter
a
serious
character
you
think
you
red
skelton
illustration
what
monstrous
brabble
is
this
you
mad
bitch
he
retorted
grunting
as
i
his
waist
shouldering
the
cuirass
to
squeeze
it
home
the
clown
costumes
on
all
you
men
i
told
him
for
now
i
noticed
that
the
others
were
in
rainbow
hues
bruce
a
real
in
yellow
tights
and
violet
doublet
as
he
furiously
bushed
out
and
clipped
crosswise
sections
of
beard
and
slapped
them
on
his
chin
gleaming
brown
with
spirit
gum
i
have
seen
any
yet
but
i
sure
i
will
suddenly
a
big
grin
split
siddy
face
and
he
laughed
out
loud
at
me
though
the
laugh
changed
to
a
gasp
as
i
strapped
in
the
cuirass
three
notches
too
tight
when
we
got
that
adjusted
he
said
i
faith
thou
slayest
me
pretty
witling
did
i
not
tell
you
this
production
is
an
experiment
a
novelty
we
shall
but
show
as
it
might
have
been
costumed
at
the
court
of
king
james
in
the
clothes
of
the
day
but
gaudier
as
was
then
the
stage
fashion
hold
dove
i
somewhat
for
thee
he
fumbled
his
grouch
bag
from
under
his
doublet
and
dipped
finger
and
thumb
in
it
and
put
in
my
palm
a
silver
model
of
the
empire
state
building
charm
bracelet
size
and
one
of
the
new
kennedy
dimes
as
i
squeezed
those
two
and
gloated
my
eyes
on
them
feeling
securer
and
happier
and
friendlier
for
them
though
i
did
at
the
moment
want
to
i
thought
siddy
right
about
that
at
least
i
read
they
used
to
costume
the
plays
that
way
though
i
do
see
how
shakespeare
stood
it
but
it
was
dirty
of
them
all
not
to
tell
me
but
that
the
way
it
is
sometimes
i
the
butt
as
well
as
the
pet
of
the
dressing
room
and
considering
all
the
breaks
i
get
i
mind
i
smiled
at
sid
and
went
on
tiptoes
and
necked
out
my
head
and
kissed
him
on
a
powdery
cheek
just
above
an
aromatic
mustache
then
i
wiped
the
smile
off
my
face
and
said
okay
siddy
play
macbeth
as
little
lord
fauntleroy
or
baby
snooks
if
you
want
to
i
never
squeak
again
but
the
elizabeth
prologue
still
an
anachronism
and
this
is
the
thing
i
came
to
tell
you
siddy
miss
nefer
not
getting
ready
for
any
measly
prologue
she
set
to
play
queen
elizabeth
all
night
and
tomorrow
morning
too
whatever
you
think
she
does
know
we
doing
but
who
do
lady
mack
if
she
does
and
martin
not
dressing
for
malcolm
but
for
the
son
of
the
last
of
the
mohicans
i
say
what
more
you
know
something
i
said
must
have
annoyed
sid
for
he
changed
his
mood
again
in
a
flash
shut
your
jaw
you
crook
brained
cat
and
begone
he
snarled
at
me
here
curtain
time
close
upon
us
and
you
come
like
a
wittol
scattering
your
mad
questions
like
the
crazed
ophelia
her
flowers
begone
i
say
yessir
i
whipped
out
softly
i
skittered
off
toward
the
door
to
the
stage
because
that
was
the
easiest
direction
i
figured
i
could
do
with
a
breath
of
less
air
then
oh
greta
i
heard
martin
call
nicely
he
changed
his
levis
for
black
tights
and
was
stepping
into
and
pulling
up
around
him
a
very
familiar
dress
dark
green
and
embroidered
with
silver
and
he
a
folded
towel
around
his
chest
to
make
a
bosom
of
sorts
i
realized
he
armed
into
the
sleeves
and
turned
his
back
to
me
hook
me
up
would
you
he
entreated
then
it
hit
me
they
had
no
actresses
in
shakespeare
day
they
used
boys
and
the
dark
green
dress
was
so
familiar
to
me
because
martin
i
said
halfway
up
the
hooks
and
working
fast
miss
costume
fitted
him
fine
you
going
to
play
lady
macbeth
yes
he
finished
for
me
wish
me
courage
will
you
greta
nobody
else
seems
to
think
i
need
it
i
punched
him
in
the
rear
then
as
i
fastened
the
last
hooks
my
eyes
topped
his
shoulder
and
i
looked
at
our
faces
side
by
side
in
the
mirror
of
his
dressing
table
his
in
spite
of
the
female
edging
and
him
being
at
least
eight
years
younger
than
me
i
think
looked
wise
poised
infinitely
resourceful
with
power
in
reserve
very
very
real
while
mine
looked
like
that
of
a
bewildered
and
characterless
child
ghost
about
to
scatter
into
air
and
the
edges
of
my
charcoal
sweater
and
skirt
contrasting
with
his
strong
colors
did
dispel
that
last
illusion
oh
by
the
way
greta
he
said
i
picked
up
a
copy
of
village
for
you
there
a
thumbnail
review
of
our
for
though
it
mentions
no
names
darn
it
it
around
here
somewhere
but
i
was
already
hurrying
on
oh
it
was
logical
enough
to
have
martin
playing
macbeth
in
a
production
styled
to
own
times
though
pedantically
i
have
thought
and
it
really
did
answer
all
my
questions
even
why
miss
nefer
could
sink
herself
wholly
in
elizabeth
tonight
if
she
wanted
to
but
it
meant
that
i
must
be
missing
so
much
of
what
was
going
on
right
around
me
in
spite
of
spending
hours
a
day
in
the
dressing
room
or
at
most
in
the
small
adjoining
john
or
in
the
wings
of
the
stage
just
outside
the
dressing
room
door
that
it
scared
me
siddy
telling
everybody
tonight
in
elizabethan
costume
boys
and
girls
sure
that
i
could
have
missed
though
you
have
thought
he
have
asked
my
help
on
the
costumes
but
martin
getting
up
in
mack
why
someone
must
have
held
the
part
on
him
times
cueing
him
while
he
got
the
lines
and
there
must
have
been
at
least
a
couple
of
rehearsals
to
make
sure
he
had
all
the
business
and
stage
movements
down
pat
and
sid
and
martin
would
have
been
doing
their
big
scenes
every
backstage
minute
they
could
spare
with
sid
yelling
witling
a
wifely
buss
and
martin
would
have
been
droning
his
lines
last
time
he
scrubbed
and
mopped
they
hiding
things
from
i
told
myself
maybe
there
was
a
hour
nobody
had
told
me
about
yet
when
they
did
all
the
things
they
did
tell
me
about
maybe
they
were
things
they
did
dare
tell
me
because
of
my
weakness
i
felt
a
cold
draft
and
shivered
and
i
realized
i
was
at
the
door
to
the
stage
i
should
explain
that
our
stage
is
rather
an
unusual
one
in
that
it
can
face
two
ways
with
the
drops
and
set
pieces
and
lighting
all
capable
of
being
switched
around
completely
to
your
left
as
you
look
out
the
door
is
an
theater
or
rather
an
place
for
the
audience
a
large
glade
walled
by
thick
tall
trees
and
with
benches
for
over
two
thousand
people
on
that
side
the
stage
kind
of
merges
into
the
grass
and
can
be
made
to
look
part
of
it
by
a
green
groundcloth
to
your
right
is
a
big
roofed
auditorium
with
the
same
number
of
seats
the
whole
thing
grew
out
of
the
free
summer
shakespeare
performances
in
central
park
that
they
started
back
in
the
the
idea
is
that
in
nice
weather
you
can
have
the
audience
outdoors
but
if
it
rains
or
there
a
cold
snap
or
if
you
want
to
play
all
winter
without
a
single
break
as
we
been
doing
then
you
can
put
your
audience
in
the
auditorium
in
that
case
a
big
wall
shuts
off
the
out
of
doors
and
keeps
the
wind
from
blowing
your
backdrop
which
is
on
that
side
of
course
when
the
auditorium
in
use
tonight
the
stage
was
set
up
to
face
the
outdoors
although
that
draft
felt
mighty
chilly
i
hesitated
as
i
always
do
at
the
door
to
the
stage
though
it
the
actual
stage
lying
just
ahead
of
me
but
only
backstage
the
wings
you
see
i
always
have
to
fight
the
feeling
that
if
i
go
out
the
dressing
room
door
go
out
just
eight
steps
the
world
will
change
while
i
out
there
and
i
never
be
able
to
get
back
it
wo
be
new
york
city
any
more
but
chicago
or
mars
or
algiers
or
atlanta
georgia
or
atlantis
or
hell
and
i
never
be
able
to
get
back
to
that
lovely
warm
womb
with
all
the
jolly
boys
and
girls
and
all
the
costumes
smelling
like
autumn
leaves
or
especially
when
there
a
cold
breeze
blowing
i
afraid
that
change
that
i
grow
wrinkled
and
old
in
eight
footsteps
or
shrink
down
to
the
witless
blob
of
a
baby
or
forget
altogether
who
i
am
or
it
occurred
to
me
for
the
first
time
now
who
i
am
which
might
be
even
worse
maybe
that
what
i
afraid
of
i
took
a
step
back
i
noticed
something
new
just
beside
the
door
a
piano
then
i
saw
that
the
legs
were
those
of
a
table
the
piano
was
just
a
box
with
yellowed
keys
spinet
harpsichord
five
minutes
everybody
martin
quietly
called
out
behind
me
i
took
hold
of
myself
greta
i
told
myself
also
for
the
first
time
know
that
some
day
you
really
going
to
have
to
face
this
thing
and
not
just
for
a
quick
dip
out
and
back
either
better
get
in
some
i
stepped
through
the
door
beau
and
doc
were
already
out
there
made
up
and
in
costume
for
ross
and
king
duncan
they
were
discreetly
peering
past
the
wings
at
the
gathering
audience
or
at
the
place
where
the
audience
ought
to
be
gathering
at
any
rate
sometimes
the
movies
and
girlie
shows
and
brainheavy
beatnik
bruhahas
outdraw
us
altogether
their
costumes
were
the
same
kooky
colorful
ones
as
the
others
doc
had
a
robe
and
a
huge
gilt
crown
beau
was
carrying
a
ragged
black
robe
and
hood
over
his
left
arm
he
doubles
the
first
witch
as
i
came
up
behind
them
making
no
noise
in
my
black
sneakers
i
heard
beau
say
i
see
some
rude
fellows
from
the
city
approaching
i
was
hoping
we
would
get
any
of
those
how
should
they
scent
us
out
i
thought
do
you
expect
them
to
come
from
if
not
the
city
central
park
is
bounded
on
three
sides
by
manhattan
island
and
on
the
fourth
by
the
eighth
avenue
subway
and
brooklyn
and
bronx
boys
have
got
pretty
sharp
scenters
and
what
it
get
you
insulting
the
woiking
and
people
of
the
woild
greatest
metropolis
be
grateful
for
any
audience
you
get
but
i
suppose
beau
lassiter
considers
anybody
from
north
of
vicksburg
a
rude
fellow
and
is
always
waiting
for
the
day
when
the
entire
audience
will
arrive
in
carriage
and
democrat
wagons
doc
replied
holding
down
his
white
beard
and
heavy
on
the
mongrel
accent
he
miraculously
manages
to
suppress
on
stage
except
when
vot
does
it
matter
ve
do
convinze
zem
ve
convinze
nobody
i
thought
shares
my
doubts
about
making
macbeth
plausible
in
rainbow
still
unobserved
by
them
i
looked
between
their
shoulders
and
got
the
first
of
my
shocks
it
was
night
at
all
but
afternoon
a
dark
cold
lowering
afternoon
admittedly
but
afternoon
all
the
same
sure
between
shows
i
sometimes
forget
whether
it
day
or
night
living
inside
like
i
do
but
getting
matinees
and
evening
performances
mixed
is
something
else
again
it
also
seemed
to
me
although
beau
was
leaning
in
now
and
i
see
so
well
that
the
glade
was
smaller
than
it
should
be
the
trees
closer
to
us
and
more
irregular
and
i
could
see
the
benches
that
was
shock
two
beau
said
anxiously
glancing
at
his
wrist
i
wonder
what
holding
up
the
queen
although
i
was
busy
keeping
up
against
the
shocks
i
managed
to
think
he
knows
about
siddy
stupid
queen
elizabeth
prologue
too
but
of
course
he
would
it
only
me
they
keep
in
the
dark
if
he
so
smart
he
ought
to
remember
that
miss
nefer
is
always
the
last
person
on
stage
even
when
she
opens
the
and
then
i
thought
i
heard
through
the
trees
the
distant
drumming
of
horses
hoofs
and
the
sound
of
a
horn
now
they
do
have
horseback
riding
in
central
park
and
you
can
hear
auto
horns
there
but
the
hoofbeats
do
drum
that
wild
way
and
there
are
so
many
riding
together
and
no
auto
horn
i
ever
heard
gave
out
with
that
sweet
yet
imperious
i
must
have
squeaked
or
something
because
beau
and
doc
turned
around
quickly
blocking
my
view
their
expressions
half
angry
half
anxious
i
turned
too
and
ran
for
the
dressing
room
for
i
could
feel
one
of
my
fits
coming
on
at
the
last
second
it
had
seemed
to
me
that
the
scenery
was
getting
skimpier
hardly
more
than
thin
trees
and
bushes
itself
and
underfoot
feeling
more
like
ground
than
a
ground
cloth
and
overhead
not
theater
roof
but
gray
sky
three
and
you
out
my
umpire
was
calling
i
made
it
through
the
dressing
room
door
and
nothing
there
was
wavering
or
dissolving
praised
be
pan
just
martin
standing
with
his
back
to
me
alert
alive
poised
like
a
cat
inside
that
green
dress
the
prompt
book
in
his
right
hand
with
a
finger
in
it
and
from
his
left
hand
long
black
tatters
swinging
telling
me
he
still
be
doubling
second
witch
and
he
was
hissing
places
please
everybody
on
stage
with
a
sweep
of
silver
and
plush
miss
nefer
came
past
him
for
once
leading
the
hurry
to
the
stage
she
had
on
the
dark
red
wig
now
for
me
that
crowned
her
characterization
it
made
me
remember
her
saying
my
brain
burns
i
ducked
aside
as
if
she
were
majesty
incarnate
and
then
she
did
break
her
own
precedent
she
stopped
at
the
new
thing
beside
the
door
and
poised
her
long
white
skinny
fingers
over
the
yellowed
keys
and
suddenly
i
remembered
what
it
was
called
a
virginals
she
stared
down
at
it
fiercely
evilly
like
a
witch
planning
an
enchantment
her
face
got
the
secret
fiendish
look
that
i
told
myself
the
real
elizabeth
would
have
had
ordering
the
deaths
of
ballard
and
babington
or
plotting
with
drake
for
all
they
say
she
did
one
of
his
raids
that
long
long
forefinger
tracing
crooked
courses
through
a
crabbedly
drawn
map
of
the
indies
and
she
smiling
at
the
dots
of
cities
that
would
burn
then
all
her
eight
fingers
came
flickering
down
and
the
strings
inside
the
virginals
began
to
twang
and
hum
with
a
rendering
of
grieg
in
the
hall
of
the
mountain
king
then
as
sid
and
bruce
and
martin
rushed
past
me
along
with
a
black
swooping
that
was
maud
already
robed
and
hooded
for
third
witch
i
beat
it
for
my
sleeping
closet
like
peer
gynt
himself
dashing
across
the
mountainside
away
from
the
cave
of
the
troll
king
who
only
wanted
to
make
tiny
slits
in
his
eyeballs
so
that
forever
afterwards
he
see
reality
just
a
little
differently
and
as
i
ran
the
of
that
menacing
mad
march
music
was
shrilling
in
my
ears
iii
sound
a
dumbe
shew
enter
the
three
fatall
sisters
with
a
rocke
a
threed
and
a
pair
of
sheeres
old
play
my
sleeping
closet
is
just
a
cot
at
the
back
end
of
the
girls
third
of
the
dressing
room
with
a
screen
to
make
it
private
when
i
sleep
i
hang
my
outside
clothes
on
the
screen
which
is
pasted
and
thumbtacked
all
over
with
the
new
york
city
stuff
that
gives
me
security
theater
programs
and
restaurant
menus
clippings
from
the
and
the
a
picture
of
the
united
nations
building
with
a
hundred
tiny
gay
paper
flags
pasted
around
it
and
hanging
in
an
old
hairnet
a
baseball
autographed
by
willie
mays
things
like
that
right
now
i
was
jumping
my
eyes
over
that
stuff
asking
it
to
keep
me
located
and
make
me
safe
as
i
lay
on
my
cot
in
my
clothes
with
my
knees
drawn
up
and
my
fingers
over
my
ears
so
the
louder
lines
from
the
play
would
be
able
to
come
nosing
back
around
the
trunks
and
tables
and
mirrors
and
find
me
generally
i
like
to
listen
to
them
even
if
they
sort
of
sepulchral
and
drained
of
overtones
by
their
crooked
trip
but
they
always
and
tonight
i
mean
this
afternoon
no
it
funny
i
should
find
security
in
mementos
of
a
city
i
dare
go
out
into
no
not
even
for
a
stroll
through
central
park
though
i
know
it
from
the
pond
to
harlem
meer
the
met
museum
the
menagerie
the
ramble
the
great
lawn
cleopatra
needle
and
all
the
rest
but
that
the
way
it
is
maybe
i
like
jonah
in
the
whale
reluctant
to
go
outside
because
the
whale
a
terrible
monster
that
awful
scary
to
look
in
the
face
and
might
really
damage
you
gulping
you
a
second
time
yet
reassured
to
know
you
living
in
the
stomach
of
that
particular
monster
and
not
a
seventeen
tentacled
one
from
the
fifth
planet
of
aldebaran
it
really
true
you
see
about
me
actually
living
in
the
dressing
room
the
boys
bring
me
meals
coffee
in
cardboard
cylinders
and
doughnuts
in
little
brown
paper
sacks
and
malts
and
hamburgers
and
apples
and
little
pizzas
and
maud
brings
me
raw
vegetables
carrots
and
parsnips
and
little
onions
and
such
and
watches
to
make
sure
i
exercise
my
molars
grinding
them
and
get
my
vitamins
i
take
in
the
little
john
architects
do
seem
to
think
actors
ever
take
baths
even
when
they
browned
themselves
all
over
playing
pindarus
the
parthian
in
and
all
my
is
caught
on
this
little
cot
in
the
twilight
of
my
nyc
screen
you
think
i
be
terrified
being
alone
in
the
dressing
room
during
the
wee
and
morning
hours
let
alone
trying
to
sleep
then
but
that
is
the
way
it
works
out
for
one
thing
there
apt
to
be
someone
sleeping
in
too
maudie
especially
and
it
my
favorite
time
too
for
and
reading
the
and
other
books
and
for
just
plain
dreaming
you
see
the
dressing
room
is
the
one
place
i
really
do
feel
safe
whatever
is
out
there
in
new
york
that
terrorizes
me
i
pretty
confident
that
it
can
never
get
in
here
besides
that
there
a
great
big
bolt
on
the
inside
of
the
dressing
room
door
that
i
throw
whenever
i
all
alone
after
the
show
next
day
they
buzz
for
me
to
open
it
it
worried
me
a
bit
at
first
and
i
had
asked
sid
but
what
if
i
so
deep
asleep
i
do
hear
and
you
have
to
get
in
fast
and
he
had
replied
sweetling
a
word
in
your
ear
our
own
beauregard
lassiter
is
the
prettiest
picklock
unjailed
since
jimmy
valentine
and
jimmy
dale
i
not
ask
where
he
learned
his
trade
but
is
sober
truth
upon
my
honor
and
beau
had
confirmed
this
with
a
courtly
bow
murmuring
at
your
service
miss
greta
how
do
you
jigger
a
big
iron
bolt
through
a
door
that
fits
like
maudie
tights
i
wanted
to
know
he
carries
lodestones
of
great
power
and
divers
subtle
tools
sid
had
explained
for
him
i
do
know
how
they
work
it
so
that
some
cop
or
park
official
does
find
out
about
me
and
raise
a
stink
maybe
sid
just
throws
a
little
more
of
the
temperament
he
uses
to
keep
most
outsiders
out
of
the
we
sure
do
get
any
janitors
or
scrubwomen
as
martin
and
i
know
only
too
well
more
likely
he
squares
someone
i
do
get
the
impression
all
the
company
gone
a
little
way
out
on
a
limb
letting
me
stay
here
that
the
directors
of
our
theater
would
like
it
if
they
found
out
about
me
in
fact
the
actors
are
all
so
good
about
helping
me
and
putting
up
with
my
antics
though
they
have
their
own
danu
digs
that
i
sometimes
think
i
must
be
related
to
one
of
them
a
distant
cousin
or
or
wife
my
god
because
i
checked
our
faces
side
by
side
in
the
mirrors
often
enough
and
i
ca
find
any
striking
family
resemblances
or
maybe
i
was
even
an
actress
in
the
company
the
least
important
one
playing
the
tiniest
roles
like
lucius
in
and
bianca
in
and
one
of
the
little
princes
in
the
three
and
fleance
and
the
gentlewoman
in
though
me
doing
even
that
much
acting
strikes
me
to
laugh
but
whatever
i
am
in
that
direction
if
i
anything
not
one
of
the
actors
has
told
me
a
word
about
it
or
dropped
the
least
hint
not
even
when
i
beg
them
to
tell
me
or
try
to
trick
them
into
it
presumably
because
it
might
revive
the
shock
that
gave
me
agoraphobia
and
amnesia
in
the
first
place
and
maybe
this
time
knock
out
my
entire
mind
or
at
least
smash
the
new
consciousness
i
made
for
myself
i
guess
they
must
have
got
by
themselves
a
year
ago
and
talked
me
over
and
decided
my
best
chance
for
cure
or
for
just
bumping
along
half
happily
was
staying
in
the
dressing
room
rather
than
being
sent
home
funny
could
i
have
another
or
to
a
mental
hospital
and
then
they
must
have
been
cocky
enough
about
their
amateur
psychiatry
and
interested
enough
in
me
the
white
horse
knows
why
to
go
ahead
with
a
program
almost
any
psychiatrist
would
be
bound
to
yike
at
i
got
so
worried
about
the
set
up
once
and
about
the
risks
they
might
be
running
that
gritting
down
my
dread
of
the
idea
i
said
to
sid
siddy
should
i
see
a
doctor
he
looked
at
me
solemnly
for
a
couple
of
seconds
and
then
said
sure
why
not
go
talk
to
doc
right
now
tipping
a
thumb
toward
doc
pyeskov
who
was
just
sneaking
back
into
the
bottom
of
his
makeup
box
what
looked
like
a
half
pint
from
the
flask
i
got
i
did
incidentally
doc
explained
to
me
kraepelin
classification
of
the
psychoses
muttering
as
he
absentmindedly
fondled
my
wrist
that
in
a
year
or
two
he
be
a
good
illustration
of
korsakov
syndrome
they
all
been
pretty
darn
good
to
me
in
their
kooky
ways
the
actors
have
not
one
of
them
has
tried
to
take
advantage
of
my
situation
to
extort
anything
out
of
me
beyond
asking
me
to
sew
on
a
button
or
polish
some
boots
or
at
worst
clean
the
wash
bowl
not
one
of
the
boys
has
made
a
pass
i
did
at
least
seem
to
invite
and
when
my
crush
on
sid
was
at
its
worst
he
shouldered
me
off
by
getting
polite
something
he
only
is
to
strangers
on
the
rebound
i
hit
beau
who
treated
me
like
a
real
southern
gentleman
all
this
for
a
stupid
little
waif
whom
anyone
but
a
gang
of
sentimental
actors
would
have
sent
to
bellevue
without
a
second
thought
or
feeling
for
to
get
disgustingly
realistic
my
most
plausible
theory
of
me
is
that
i
a
girl
from
iowa
who
saw
her
twenties
slipping
away
and
her
sanity
too
and
made
the
dash
to
greenwich
village
and
went
so
ape
on
shakespeare
after
seeing
her
first
performance
in
central
park
that
she
kept
going
back
there
night
after
night
christopher
street
penn
station
times
square
columbus
circle
see
and
hung
around
the
stage
door
so
mousy
but
that
the
actors
made
a
pet
of
her
and
then
something
very
nasty
happened
to
her
either
down
at
the
village
or
in
a
dark
corner
of
the
park
something
so
nasty
that
it
blew
the
top
of
her
head
right
off
and
she
ran
to
the
only
people
and
place
where
she
felt
she
could
ever
again
feel
safe
and
she
showed
them
the
top
of
her
head
with
its
singed
hair
and
its
jagged
ring
of
skull
and
they
took
pity
my
least
plausible
theory
of
me
but
the
one
i
like
the
most
is
that
i
was
born
in
the
dressing
room
cradled
in
the
top
of
a
flat
theatrical
trunk
with
my
ears
full
of
shakespeare
lines
before
i
ever
said
mama
let
alone
lamped
a
tv
when
i
cried
by
whoever
was
off
stage
old
props
my
first
toys
trying
to
eat
crepe
hair
my
first
indiscretion
sticks
of
my
first
crayons
you
know
i
really
would
be
bothered
by
crazy
fears
about
new
york
changing
and
the
dressing
room
shifting
around
in
space
and
time
if
i
could
be
sure
i
always
be
able
to
stay
in
it
and
that
the
same
sweet
guys
and
gals
would
always
be
with
me
and
that
the
shows
would
always
go
on
this
show
was
sure
going
on
it
suddenly
hit
me
for
i
let
my
fingers
slip
off
my
ears
as
i
sentimentalized
and
and
i
heard
muted
by
the
length
and
stuff
of
the
dressing
room
the
slow
beat
of
a
drum
and
then
a
drum
note
in
maudie
voice
taking
up
that
beat
as
she
warned
the
other
two
witches
a
drum
a
drum
macbeth
doth
come
why
i
not
only
missed
sid
queen
elizabeth
prologue
kicking
myself
that
i
had
now
it
was
over
also
missed
the
short
witch
scene
with
its
famous
fair
is
foul
and
foul
is
fair
the
bloody
sergeant
scene
where
duncan
hears
about
macbeth
victory
and
we
were
well
into
the
second
witch
scene
the
one
on
the
blasted
heath
where
macbeth
gets
it
predicted
to
him
be
king
after
duncan
and
is
tempted
to
speculate
about
hurrying
up
the
process
i
sat
up
i
did
hesitate
a
minute
then
my
fingers
going
back
toward
my
ears
because
is
specially
and
when
i
had
one
of
my
fits
i
feel
weak
for
a
while
and
things
are
blurry
and
uncertain
maybe
i
better
take
a
couple
of
the
barbiturate
sleeping
pills
maudie
manages
to
get
for
me
and
but
i
told
myself
want
to
watch
this
show
you
want
to
see
how
they
do
in
those
crazy
costumes
you
especially
want
to
see
how
martin
makes
out
he
never
forgive
you
if
you
so
i
walked
to
the
other
end
of
the
empty
dressing
room
moving
quite
slowly
and
touching
the
edges
here
and
there
the
words
of
the
play
getting
louder
all
the
time
by
the
time
i
got
to
the
door
was
saying
to
the
witches
if
you
can
look
into
the
seeds
of
time
and
say
which
grain
will
grow
and
which
will
not
those
lines
that
stir
anyone
imagination
with
their
veiled
vision
of
the
universe
the
overall
lighting
was
a
little
dim
afternoon
fading
already
a
matinee
and
the
stage
lights
flickery
and
the
scenery
still
a
little
oh
my
fits
can
be
lulus
but
i
concentrated
on
the
actors
watching
them
through
the
in
the
wings
they
were
solid
enough
giving
a
solid
performance
too
as
i
decided
after
watching
that
scene
through
and
the
one
after
it
where
duncan
congratulates
macbeth
with
never
a
pause
between
the
two
scenes
in
true
elizabethan
style
nobody
was
laughing
at
the
colorful
costumes
after
a
while
i
began
to
accept
them
myself
oh
it
was
a
different
than
our
company
usually
does
louder
and
faster
with
shorter
pauses
between
speeches
the
blank
verse
at
times
approaching
a
chant
but
it
had
a
lot
of
real
guts
and
everybody
was
just
throwing
themselves
into
it
sid
especially
the
first
lady
macbeth
scene
came
without
exactly
realizing
it
i
moved
forward
to
where
i
been
when
i
got
my
three
shocks
martin
is
so
intent
on
his
career
and
making
good
that
he
has
me
the
same
way
about
it
the
thaness
started
off
as
she
always
does
toward
the
opposite
side
of
the
stage
and
facing
a
little
away
from
me
then
she
moved
a
step
and
looked
down
at
the
letter
in
her
hands
and
began
to
read
it
though
there
was
nothing
on
it
but
scribble
and
my
heart
sank
because
the
voice
i
heard
was
miss
nefer
i
thought
and
almost
said
out
loud
dammit
he
funked
out
or
sid
decided
at
the
last
minute
he
could
trust
him
with
the
part
whoever
got
miss
nefer
out
of
the
ice
cream
cone
in
time
then
she
swung
around
and
i
saw
that
no
my
god
it
martin
no
mistaking
he
been
using
her
voice
when
a
person
first
does
a
part
especially
getting
up
in
it
without
much
rehearsing
he
bound
to
copy
the
actor
he
been
hearing
doing
it
and
as
i
listened
on
i
realized
it
was
fundamentally
martin
own
voice
pitched
a
trifle
high
only
some
of
the
intonations
and
rhythms
were
miss
nefer
he
was
showing
a
lot
of
feeling
and
intensity
too
and
real
poise
off
to
a
great
start
i
cheered
inwardly
it
up
just
then
i
looked
toward
the
audience
once
again
i
almost
squeaked
out
loud
for
out
there
close
to
the
stage
in
the
very
middle
of
the
reserve
section
was
a
carpet
spread
out
and
sitting
in
the
middle
of
it
on
some
sort
of
little
chair
with
what
looked
like
two
charcoal
braziers
smoking
to
either
side
of
her
was
miss
nefer
with
a
string
of
extras
in
elizabethan
hats
with
cloaks
pulled
around
them
for
a
second
it
really
threw
me
because
it
reminded
me
of
the
things
i
seen
or
thought
i
seen
the
couple
of
times
i
sneaked
a
peek
through
the
at
the
audience
in
the
indoor
auditorium
it
hardly
threw
me
for
more
than
a
second
though
because
i
remembered
that
the
characters
who
speak
shakespeare
prologues
often
stay
on
stage
and
sometimes
kind
of
join
the
audience
and
even
comment
on
the
play
from
time
to
time
christopher
sly
and
attendant
lords
in
for
one
sid
had
just
copied
and
in
his
usual
style
laid
it
on
thick
bully
for
you
i
thought
sure
the
witless
new
york
groundlings
will
be
thrilled
to
their
cold
little
toes
knowing
they
sitting
in
the
same
audience
as
good
queen
liz
and
attendant
courtiers
and
as
for
you
miss
i
added
a
shade
invidiously
just
keep
on
sitting
cold
in
central
park
warmed
by
smoke
from
braziers
and
keep
your
mouth
shut
and
everything
be
fine
i
sincerely
glad
you
be
able
to
be
queen
elizabeth
all
night
long
just
so
long
as
you
do
try
to
steal
the
scene
from
martin
and
the
rest
of
the
cast
and
the
real
suppose
that
camp
chair
will
get
a
little
uncomfortable
by
the
time
the
fifth
act
comes
tramping
along
to
that
drumbeat
but
i
sure
you
so
much
in
character
you
never
feel
thing
though
just
do
scare
me
again
pretending
to
work
witchcraft
with
a
virginals
or
any
other
now
i
going
to
watch
the
iv
to
dream
of
new
dimensions
cheating
checkmate
by
painting
the
king
robe
so
that
he
slides
like
a
queen
graves
i
swung
back
to
the
play
just
at
the
moment
lady
mack
soliloquizes
come
to
my
woman
breasts
and
take
my
milk
for
gall
you
murdering
ministers
although
i
knew
it
was
just
folded
towel
martin
was
touching
with
his
fingertips
as
he
lifted
them
to
the
top
half
of
his
green
bodice
i
got
carried
away
he
made
it
so
real
i
decided
boys
can
play
girls
better
than
people
think
maybe
they
should
do
it
a
little
more
often
and
girls
play
boys
too
then
came
back
to
his
wife
from
the
wars
looking
triumphant
but
scared
because
the
started
to
smoulder
in
him
and
she
got
busy
fanning
the
blaze
like
any
other
good
little
intent
on
her
husband
rising
in
the
company
and
knowing
that
she
the
power
behind
him
and
that
when
there
are
promotions
someone
always
got
to
get
the
axe
sid
and
martin
made
this
charming
little
domestic
scene
so
natural
yet
gutsy
too
that
i
wanted
to
shout
hooray
even
sid
clutching
martin
to
that
ridiculous
cuirass
did
have
one
note
of
horseplay
in
it
their
bodies
spoke
it
was
the
mccoy
after
that
the
play
began
to
get
real
good
the
fast
tempo
and
exaggerated
facial
expressions
actually
helping
it
by
the
time
the
dagger
scene
came
along
i
was
digging
my
fingernails
into
my
sweaty
palms
which
was
a
good
thing
my
eating
up
the
play
i
mean
because
it
kept
me
from
looking
at
the
audience
again
even
taking
a
fast
peek
as
you
gathered
audiences
bug
me
all
those
people
out
there
in
the
shadows
watching
the
actors
in
the
light
all
those
silent
voyeurs
as
bruce
calls
them
why
they
might
be
anything
and
sometimes
to
my
sorrow
i
think
they
are
maybe
crouching
in
the
dark
out
there
hiding
among
the
others
is
the
one
who
did
the
nasty
thing
to
me
that
tore
off
the
top
of
my
head
anyhow
if
i
so
much
as
glance
at
the
audience
i
begin
to
get
ideas
about
it
and
sometimes
even
if
i
do
as
just
at
this
moment
i
thought
i
heard
horses
restlessly
pawing
hard
ground
and
one
whinny
though
that
was
shut
off
fast
kressed
us
i
thought
ca
have
hired
horses
for
much
as
he
a
circus
man
at
heart
we
do
have
that
kind
of
money
but
just
then
gasped
as
if
he
were
sucking
in
a
bucket
of
air
he
shed
the
cuirass
fortunately
he
said
is
this
a
dagger
which
i
see
before
me
the
handle
toward
my
hand
and
the
play
hooked
me
again
and
i
had
no
time
to
think
about
or
listen
for
anything
else
most
of
the
offstage
actors
were
on
the
other
side
of
the
stage
as
that
where
they
make
their
exits
and
entrances
at
this
point
in
the
second
act
i
stood
alone
in
the
wings
watching
the
play
like
a
bug
frightened
only
of
the
horrors
shakespeare
had
in
mind
when
he
wrote
it
yes
the
play
was
going
great
the
dagger
scene
was
terrific
where
duncan
gets
murdered
offstage
and
so
was
the
part
afterwards
where
hysteria
mounts
as
the
crime
discovered
but
just
at
this
point
i
began
to
catch
notes
i
did
like
twice
someone
was
late
on
entrance
and
came
on
as
if
shot
from
a
cannon
and
three
times
at
least
sid
had
to
throw
someone
a
line
when
they
blew
up
in
the
clutches
sid
better
than
any
prompt
book
it
began
to
look
as
if
the
play
were
getting
out
of
control
maybe
because
the
new
tempo
was
so
hot
but
they
got
through
the
murder
scene
okay
as
they
came
trooping
off
yelling
well
contented
most
of
them
on
my
side
for
a
change
i
went
for
sid
with
a
towel
he
always
sweats
like
a
pig
in
the
murder
scene
i
mopped
his
neck
and
shoved
the
towel
up
under
his
doublet
to
catch
the
dripping
armpits
meanwhile
he
was
fumbling
around
on
a
narrow
table
where
they
lay
props
and
costumes
for
quick
changes
suddenly
he
dug
his
fingers
into
my
shoulder
enough
to
catch
my
attention
at
this
point
meaning
show
bruises
tomorrow
and
yelled
at
me
under
his
breath
and
you
love
me
our
crows
and
robes
presto
i
was
off
like
a
flash
to
the
costumery
there
were
and
mack
robes
and
stuff
hanging
and
sitting
just
where
i
knew
they
have
to
be
i
snatched
them
up
thinking
they
made
a
mistake
when
they
did
tell
about
this
special
and
i
started
back
like
flash
two
as
i
shot
out
the
dressing
room
door
the
theater
was
very
quiet
there
a
short
scene
on
stage
then
to
give
the
audience
a
breather
i
heard
miss
nefer
say
loudly
it
had
to
be
loud
to
get
to
me
from
even
the
front
of
the
audience
is
a
good
bloody
play
eyes
and
some
voice
i
did
recognize
reply
a
bit
grudgingly
there
meat
in
it
and
some
poetry
too
though
she
went
on
still
as
loudly
as
if
she
owned
the
theater
make
master
kyd
bite
his
nails
with
jealousy
ha
ha
yourself
you
i
thought
as
i
helped
sid
and
then
martin
on
with
their
royal
outer
duds
but
at
the
same
time
i
knew
sid
must
have
written
those
lines
himself
to
go
along
with
his
prologue
they
had
the
unmistakable
lessingham
touch
did
he
really
expect
the
audience
to
make
anything
of
that
reference
to
shakespeare
predecessor
thomas
kyd
of
spanish
and
the
lost
and
if
they
knew
enough
to
spot
that
would
they
be
bound
to
realize
the
whole
was
anachronistic
but
when
sid
gets
an
inspiration
he
can
be
very
just
then
while
was
speaking
his
broody
low
soliloquy
on
stage
miss
nefer
cut
in
again
loudly
with
aye
eyes
a
good
bloody
play
yet
somehow
methinks
i
know
not
how
i
heard
it
before
whereupon
sid
grabbed
martin
by
the
wrist
and
hissed
hear
oh
i
like
not
that
and
i
thought
so
now
she
beginning
to
well
right
away
they
all
went
on
stage
with
a
flourish
sid
and
martin
crowned
and
hand
in
hand
the
play
got
going
strong
again
but
there
were
still
those
undercurrents
and
i
began
to
be
more
uneasy
than
caught
up
and
i
had
to
stare
consciously
at
the
actors
to
keep
off
a
other
things
began
to
bother
me
too
such
as
all
the
doubling
a
great
play
for
doubling
for
instance
anyone
except
macbeth
or
banquo
can
double
one
of
the
three
witches
or
one
of
the
three
murderers
for
that
matter
normally
we
double
at
least
one
or
two
of
the
witches
and
murderers
but
this
performance
there
been
more
than
i
ever
seen
doc
had
whipped
off
his
duncan
beard
and
thrown
on
a
brown
smock
and
hood
to
play
the
porter
with
his
normal
accents
well
a
drunk
impersonating
a
drunk
pretty
appropriate
but
bruce
was
doing
the
double
of
banquo
and
macduff
using
a
ringing
tenor
voice
for
the
latter
and
wearing
in
the
murder
scene
a
helmet
with
dropped
visor
to
hide
his
banquo
beard
he
be
able
to
tear
it
off
of
course
after
the
murderers
got
banquo
and
he
made
his
brief
appearance
as
a
ghost
in
the
banquet
scene
i
asked
myself
god
has
siddy
got
all
the
other
actors
out
in
front
playing
courtiers
to
wasting
them
that
way
the
whoreson
rogue
gone
nuts
but
really
it
was
plain
frightening
all
that
frantic
doubling
and
tripling
with
its
suggestion
that
the
play
and
the
company
too
freya
forfend
was
becoming
a
ricketty
patchwork
illusion
with
everybody
racing
around
faster
and
faster
to
hide
the
holes
and
the
stuff
and
the
warped
were
scary
too
i
was
actually
shivering
by
the
time
sid
got
to
light
thickens
and
the
crow
makes
wing
to
the
rooky
wood
good
things
of
day
begin
to
droop
and
drowse
whiles
night
black
agents
to
their
preys
do
rouse
those
graveyard
lines
did
help
my
nerves
any
of
course
nor
did
thinking
i
heard
say
from
the
audience
rather
softly
for
her
this
time
eyes
i
have
heard
that
speech
i
know
not
where
think
you
stolen
i
told
myself
need
a
miltown
before
the
crow
makes
wing
through
your
kooky
i
turned
to
go
and
fetch
me
one
from
my
closet
and
stopped
dead
just
behind
me
pacing
back
and
forth
like
an
tiger
in
the
gloomy
wings
looking
daggers
at
the
audience
every
time
she
turned
at
that
end
of
her
invisible
cage
but
ignoring
me
completely
was
miss
nefer
in
the
elizabeth
wig
and
rig
well
i
suppose
i
should
have
said
to
myself
you
imagined
that
last
loud
whisper
from
the
audience
miss
nefer
simply
unkinked
herself
waved
a
hand
to
the
real
audience
and
come
back
stage
maybe
sid
just
had
her
out
there
for
the
first
half
of
the
play
or
maybe
she
just
could
stand
watching
martin
give
such
a
performance
in
her
part
of
lady
yes
maybe
i
should
have
told
myself
something
like
that
but
somehow
all
i
could
think
then
and
i
thought
it
with
a
steady
mounting
shiver
was
got
two
elizabeths
this
one
is
our
witch
nefer
i
know
i
dressed
her
and
i
know
that
from
the
virginals
but
if
this
is
our
elizabeth
the
company
elizabeth
the
stage
elizabeth
who
the
other
and
because
i
did
dare
to
let
myself
think
of
the
answer
to
that
question
i
dodged
around
the
invisible
cage
that
the
skirt
seemed
to
ripple
against
as
the
tiger
queen
turned
and
i
ran
into
the
dressing
room
my
only
thought
to
get
behind
my
new
york
city
screen
v
even
little
things
are
turning
out
to
be
great
things
and
becoming
intensely
interesting
have
you
ever
thought
about
the
properties
of
numbers
the
maiden
lying
on
my
cot
my
eyes
crosswise
to
the
printing
i
looked
from
a
pink
algonquin
menu
to
a
pale
green
new
amsterdam
program
with
a
tiny
doll
of
father
knickerbocker
dangling
between
them
on
a
yellow
thread
really
they
were
covering
up
much
of
anything
a
ghostly
hole
an
inch
and
a
half
across
seemed
to
char
itself
in
the
program
as
if
my
eye
were
right
up
against
it
i
saw
in
vivid
memory
what
i
seen
the
two
times
i
dared
a
peek
through
the
hole
in
the
curtain
a
bevy
of
ladies
in
masks
and
nell
gwyn
dresses
and
men
in
king
charles
and
long
curled
hair
and
the
second
time
a
bunch
of
people
and
creatures
just
wild
all
sorts
and
colors
of
clothes
humans
with
hoofs
for
feet
and
antennae
springing
from
their
foreheads
furry
and
feathery
things
that
had
more
arms
than
two
and
in
one
case
that
many
heads
as
if
they
were
dressed
up
in
our
and
costumes
and
some
more
besides
naturally
i
had
fits
both
times
afterwards
sid
had
wagged
a
finger
at
me
and
explained
that
on
those
two
nights
we
been
giving
performances
for
people
who
arranged
a
costume
and
been
going
to
attend
a
masquerade
ball
and
when
would
i
learn
to
guard
my
pate
do
know
i
guess
i
answered
now
quick
looking
at
a
giants
pennant
a
korvette
ad
a
map
of
central
park
my
willie
mays
baseball
and
a
radio
city
tour
ticket
that
was
eight
items
i
looked
at
this
trip
without
feeling
any
inward
improvement
they
reassuring
me
at
all
the
blue
fly
came
slowly
buzzing
down
over
my
screen
and
i
asked
it
what
are
you
looking
for
a
spider
when
what
should
i
hear
coming
back
through
the
dressing
room
straight
toward
my
sleeping
closet
but
miss
nefer
footsteps
no
one
else
walks
that
way
going
to
do
something
to
you
i
thought
the
maniac
in
the
company
she
the
one
who
terrorized
you
with
the
boning
knife
in
the
shrubbery
or
sicked
the
giant
tarantula
on
you
at
the
dark
end
of
the
subway
platform
or
whatever
it
was
and
the
others
are
covering
up
for
she
going
to
smile
the
and
weave
those
white
at
you
all
eight
of
them
and
birnam
wood
come
to
dunsinane
and
you
be
burnt
at
the
stake
by
men
in
armor
or
drawn
and
quartered
by
monkeys
that
talk
or
torn
apart
by
wild
centaurs
or
whirled
through
the
roof
to
the
moon
without
being
dressed
for
it
or
sent
burrowing
into
the
past
to
stifle
in
iowa
or
egypt
the
screen
wo
keep
her
then
a
head
of
hair
pushed
over
the
screen
but
it
was
brahma
bless
us
and
a
moment
later
martin
was
giving
me
one
of
his
rare
smiles
i
said
marty
do
something
for
me
do
ever
use
miss
footsteps
again
her
voice
okay
if
you
have
to
but
not
the
footsteps
do
ask
me
why
just
do
martin
came
around
and
sat
on
the
foot
of
my
cot
my
legs
were
already
doubled
up
he
straightened
out
his
skirt
and
rested
a
hand
on
my
black
sneakers
illustration
feeling
a
little
wonky
greta
he
asked
do
worry
about
me
banquo
dead
and
so
his
ghost
we
finished
the
banquet
scene
i
got
lots
of
time
i
just
looked
at
him
queerly
i
guess
then
without
lifting
my
head
i
asked
him
martin
tell
me
the
truth
does
the
dressing
room
move
around
i
was
talking
so
low
that
he
hitched
a
little
closer
not
touching
me
anywhere
else
though
the
earth
whipping
around
the
sun
at
miles
a
second
he
replied
and
the
dressing
room
goes
with
it
i
shook
my
head
my
cheek
scrubbing
the
pillow
i
mean
shifting
i
said
by
itself
how
he
asked
well
i
told
him
i
had
this
idea
it
just
a
sort
of
fancy
remember
that
if
you
wanted
to
and
well
do
things
you
could
hardly
pick
a
more
practical
machine
than
a
dressing
room
and
sort
of
stage
and
attached
with
actors
to
man
it
actors
can
fit
in
anywhere
they
used
to
learning
new
parts
and
wearing
strange
costumes
heck
they
even
used
to
traveling
a
lot
and
if
an
actor
a
bit
strange
nobody
thinks
anything
of
it
he
almost
expected
to
be
foreign
it
an
asset
to
him
and
a
theater
well
a
theater
can
spring
up
almost
anywhere
and
nobody
ask
questions
except
the
zoning
authorities
and
such
and
they
can
always
be
squared
theaters
come
and
go
it
happens
all
the
time
they
transitory
yet
theaters
are
crossroads
anonymous
meeting
places
anybody
with
a
few
bucks
or
sometimes
nothing
at
all
can
go
and
theaters
attract
important
people
the
sort
of
people
you
might
want
to
do
something
to
caesar
was
stabbed
in
a
theater
lincoln
was
shot
in
one
and
my
voice
trailed
off
a
cute
idea
he
commented
i
reached
down
to
his
hand
on
my
shoe
and
took
hold
of
his
middle
finger
as
a
baby
might
yeah
i
said
but
martin
is
it
true
he
asked
me
gravely
what
do
you
think
i
did
say
anything
how
would
you
like
to
work
in
a
company
like
that
he
asked
speculatively
i
do
really
know
i
said
he
sat
up
straighter
and
his
voice
got
brisk
well
all
fantasy
aside
how
you
like
to
work
in
this
company
he
asked
lightly
slapping
my
ankle
on
the
stage
i
mean
sid
thinks
you
ready
for
some
of
the
smaller
parts
in
fact
he
asked
me
to
put
it
to
you
he
thinks
you
never
take
him
seriously
pardon
me
while
i
gasp
and
glow
i
said
then
oh
marty
i
really
imagine
myself
doing
the
tiniest
part
me
neither
eight
months
ago
he
said
now
look
lady
macbeth
but
marty
i
said
reaching
for
his
finger
again
you
answered
my
question
about
whether
it
true
oh
that
he
said
with
a
laugh
switching
his
hand
to
the
other
side
ask
me
something
else
okay
i
said
why
am
i
bugged
on
the
number
eight
because
permanently
behind
a
private
eight
a
number
with
many
properties
he
said
suddenly
as
intently
serious
as
he
usually
is
the
corners
of
a
cube
you
mean
i
a
square
i
said
or
just
a
brick
you
know
a
brick
but
eight
most
curious
property
he
continued
with
a
frown
is
that
lying
on
its
side
it
signifies
infinity
so
eight
erect
is
really
and
suddenly
his
naturally
solemn
face
got
a
great
glow
of
inspiration
and
devotion
infinity
arisen
well
i
do
know
you
meet
quite
a
few
people
in
the
theater
who
are
bats
on
numerology
they
use
it
to
pick
but
i
never
have
guessed
it
of
martin
he
always
struck
me
as
the
skeptical
cynical
type
i
had
another
idea
about
eight
i
said
hesitatingly
spiders
that
asterisk
on
miss
nefer
forehead
i
suppressed
a
shudder
you
do
like
her
do
you
he
stated
i
afraid
of
her
i
said
you
should
be
she
a
very
great
woman
and
tonight
she
playing
an
infinitely
more
difficult
part
than
i
am
no
greta
he
went
on
as
i
started
to
protest
believe
me
you
do
understand
anything
about
it
at
this
moment
just
as
you
do
understand
about
spiders
fearing
them
they
the
first
to
climb
the
rigging
and
to
climb
ashore
too
they
the
the
the
connectors
siva
and
kali
united
in
love
they
the
double
mandala
the
beginning
and
the
end
infinity
mustered
and
on
the
march
they
also
on
my
new
york
screen
i
squeaked
shrinking
back
across
the
cot
a
little
and
pointing
at
a
tiny
glinting
thing
mounting
below
my
martin
gently
caught
its
line
on
his
finger
and
lifted
it
very
close
to
his
face
eight
eyes
too
he
told
me
then
poor
little
god
he
said
and
put
it
back
marty
marty
sid
desperate
rasped
the
length
of
the
dressing
room
martin
stood
up
yes
sid
sid
voice
stayed
a
whisper
but
went
from
desperate
to
ferocious
you
villainous
know
you
not
the
cauldron
scene
been
playing
a
hundred
heartbeats
is
my
entrance
and
we
still
mustering
only
two
witches
out
of
three
oh
you
starveling
before
sid
had
got
much
more
than
half
of
that
out
martin
had
slipped
around
the
screen
raced
the
length
of
the
dressing
room
and
heard
a
lusty
thwack
as
he
went
out
the
door
i
could
help
grinning
though
with
martin
racked
by
anxieties
and
reliefs
over
his
first
time
as
lady
mack
it
was
easy
to
understand
it
slipping
his
mind
that
he
was
still
doubling
second
witch
vi
i
will
vault
credit
and
affect
high
pleasures
beyond
death
ferdinand
i
sat
down
where
martin
had
been
first
pushing
the
screen
far
enough
to
the
side
for
me
to
see
the
length
of
the
dressing
room
and
notice
anyone
coming
through
the
door
and
any
blurs
moving
behind
the
thin
white
curtain
shutting
off
the
boys
i
been
going
to
think
but
instead
i
just
sat
there
experiencing
my
body
and
the
room
around
it
steadying
myself
or
maybe
readying
myself
i
could
tell
which
but
it
was
nothing
to
think
about
only
to
feel
my
heartbeat
became
a
very
faint
slow
solid
throb
my
spine
straightened
no
one
came
in
or
went
out
distantly
i
heard
macbeth
and
the
witches
and
the
apparitions
talk
once
i
looked
at
the
new
york
screen
but
all
the
stuff
there
had
grown
stale
no
protection
no
nothing
i
reached
down
to
my
suitcase
and
from
where
i
been
going
to
get
a
miltown
i
took
a
dexedrine
and
popped
it
in
my
mouth
then
i
started
out
beginning
to
shake
when
i
got
to
the
end
of
the
curtain
i
went
around
it
to
dressing
table
and
asked
shakespeare
am
i
doing
the
right
thing
pop
but
he
did
answer
me
out
of
his
portrait
he
just
looked
like
he
knew
a
lot
but
would
tell
and
i
found
myself
think
of
a
little
photo
sid
had
used
to
keep
there
too
of
a
cocky
young
actor
with
erich
autographed
across
it
in
white
ink
at
least
i
supposed
he
was
an
actor
he
looked
a
little
like
erich
von
stroheim
but
nicer
yet
somehow
nastier
too
the
photo
had
used
to
upset
me
i
do
know
why
sid
must
have
noticed
it
for
one
day
it
was
gone
i
thought
of
the
tiny
spider
crawling
across
the
remembered
silver
frame
and
for
some
reason
it
gave
me
the
cold
creeps
well
this
was
doing
me
any
good
just
making
me
feel
dismal
again
so
i
quickly
went
out
in
the
door
i
had
to
slip
around
the
actors
coming
back
from
the
cauldron
scene
and
the
big
bolt
nicked
my
hip
outside
maud
was
peeling
off
her
third
witch
stuff
to
reveal
lady
macduff
beneath
she
twitched
me
a
grin
how
it
going
i
asked
okay
i
guess
she
shrugged
what
an
audience
noisy
as
highschool
kids
how
come
sid
did
have
a
boy
do
your
part
i
asked
he
goofed
i
guess
but
i
battened
down
my
bosoms
and
playing
macduff
as
a
boy
how
does
a
girl
do
that
in
a
dress
i
asked
she
sits
stiff
and
thinks
pants
she
said
handing
me
her
witch
robe
me
now
i
got
to
find
my
children
and
go
get
murdered
i
moved
a
few
steps
nearer
the
stage
when
i
felt
the
gentlest
tug
at
my
hip
i
looked
down
and
saw
that
a
taut
black
thread
from
the
bottom
of
my
sweater
connected
me
with
the
dressing
room
it
must
have
snagged
on
the
big
bolt
and
unraveled
i
moved
my
body
an
inch
or
so
tugging
it
delicately
to
see
what
it
felt
like
and
i
got
the
answers
theseus
clew
a
spider
line
an
umbilicus
i
reached
down
close
to
my
side
and
snapped
it
with
my
fingernails
the
black
thread
leaped
away
but
the
dressing
room
door
vanish
or
the
wings
change
or
the
world
end
and
i
did
fall
down
after
that
i
just
stood
there
for
quite
a
while
feeling
my
new
freedom
and
steadiness
letting
my
body
get
used
to
it
i
did
do
any
thinking
i
hardly
bothered
to
study
anything
around
me
though
i
did
notice
that
there
were
more
bushes
and
trees
than
set
pieces
and
that
the
flickery
lightning
was
simply
torches
and
that
queen
elizabeth
was
in
or
back
in
the
audience
sometimes
letting
your
body
get
used
to
something
is
all
you
should
do
or
maybe
can
do
and
i
did
smell
horse
dung
when
the
lady
macduff
scene
was
over
and
the
chicken
scene
well
begun
i
went
back
to
the
dressing
room
actors
call
it
the
chicken
scene
because
macduff
weeps
in
it
about
all
my
pretty
chickens
and
their
dam
meaning
his
kids
and
wife
being
murdered
at
one
fell
swoop
on
orders
of
that
macbeth
inside
the
dressing
room
i
steered
down
the
boys
side
doc
was
putting
on
an
dark
makeup
for
macbeth
last
faithful
servant
seyton
he
did
seem
as
as
usual
for
fourth
act
but
just
the
same
i
stopped
to
help
him
get
into
a
shirt
made
of
thick
cord
woven
and
silvered
in
the
third
chair
beyond
sid
was
sitting
back
with
his
corset
loosened
and
critically
surveying
martin
who
now
changed
to
a
white
wool
nightgown
that
clung
and
draped
beautifully
but
not
particularly
enticingly
on
him
and
his
folded
towel
which
had
slipped
a
bit
from
beside
sid
mirror
shakespeare
smiled
out
of
his
portrait
at
them
like
an
intelligent
bug
martin
stood
tall
spread
his
arms
rather
like
a
high
priest
and
intoned
romani
populares
i
nudged
doc
what
goes
on
now
i
whispered
he
turned
a
bleary
eye
on
them
i
think
they
are
rehearsing
in
latin
he
shrugged
it
begins
the
oration
of
antony
but
why
i
asked
sid
does
like
to
put
every
moment
to
use
when
the
is
in
people
but
this
project
seemed
pretty
far
afield
yet
at
the
same
time
i
felt
my
scalp
shivering
as
if
my
mind
were
jumping
with
speculations
just
below
the
surface
doc
shook
his
head
and
shrugged
again
sid
shoved
a
palm
at
martin
and
roared
softly
boy
not
playing
a
roman
statua
but
a
roman
loosen
your
knees
and
try
again
then
he
saw
me
signing
martin
to
stop
he
called
come
hither
sweetling
i
obeyed
quickly
he
gave
me
a
fiendish
grin
and
said
heard
our
proposal
from
martin
what
sayest
thou
wench
this
time
the
shiver
was
in
my
back
it
felt
good
i
realized
i
was
grinning
back
at
him
and
i
knew
what
i
been
getting
ready
for
the
last
twenty
minutes
i
on
i
said
count
me
in
the
company
sid
jumped
up
and
grabbed
me
by
the
shoulders
and
hair
and
bussed
me
on
both
cheeks
it
was
a
little
like
being
bombed
prodigious
he
cried
play
the
gentlewoman
in
the
sleepwalking
scene
tonight
martin
her
costume
now
sweet
wench
mark
me
well
his
voice
grew
grave
and
old
when
was
it
she
last
walked
the
new
courage
went
out
of
me
like
water
down
a
chute
but
siddy
i
ca
start
i
protested
half
pleading
half
outraged
tonight
or
never
is
an
emergency
we
again
his
voice
changed
when
was
it
she
last
walked
but
siddy
i
do
the
part
you
must
you
heard
the
play
twenty
times
this
year
past
when
was
it
she
last
walked
martin
was
back
and
yanking
down
a
blonde
wig
on
my
head
and
shoving
my
arms
into
a
light
gray
robe
i
never
studied
i
squeaked
at
sidney
liar
i
watched
your
lips
move
a
dozen
nights
when
you
watched
the
scene
from
the
wings
close
your
eyes
girl
martin
unhand
her
close
your
eyes
girl
empty
your
mind
and
listen
listen
only
when
was
it
she
last
walked
in
the
blackness
i
heard
myself
replying
to
that
cue
first
in
a
whisper
then
more
loudly
then
but
grave
since
his
majesty
went
into
the
field
i
have
seen
her
rise
from
her
bed
throw
her
nightgown
upon
her
unlock
her
closet
take
forth
bravissimo
siddy
cried
and
bombed
me
again
martin
hugged
his
arm
around
my
shoulders
too
then
quickly
stooped
to
start
hooking
up
my
robe
from
the
bottom
but
that
only
the
first
lines
siddy
i
protested
they
enough
but
siddy
what
if
i
blow
up
i
asked
keep
your
mind
empty
you
wo
further
i
be
at
your
side
doubling
the
doctor
to
prompt
you
if
you
pause
ought
to
take
care
of
two
of
i
thought
then
something
else
struck
me
but
siddy
i
quavered
how
do
i
play
the
gentlewoman
as
a
boy
boy
he
demanded
wonderingly
play
her
without
falling
down
flat
on
your
face
and
i
be
past
measure
happy
and
he
smacked
me
hard
on
the
fanny
martin
fingers
were
darting
at
the
next
to
the
last
hook
i
stopped
him
and
shoved
my
hand
down
the
neck
of
my
sweater
and
got
hold
of
the
subway
token
and
the
chain
it
was
on
and
yanked
it
burned
my
neck
but
the
gold
links
parted
i
started
to
throw
it
across
the
room
but
instead
i
smiled
at
siddy
and
dropped
it
in
his
palm
the
sleepwalking
scene
maud
hissed
insistently
to
us
from
the
door
vii
i
know
death
hath
ten
thousand
several
doors
for
men
to
take
their
exits
and
is
found
they
go
on
such
strange
geometrical
hinges
you
may
open
them
both
ways
the
duchess
there
is
this
about
an
actor
on
stage
he
can
see
the
audience
but
he
ca
at
them
unless
he
a
narrator
or
some
sort
of
comic
i
was
the
first
grendel
groks
and
only
scared
to
death
of
becoming
the
second
as
siddy
walked
me
out
of
the
wings
onto
the
stage
over
the
groundcloth
that
felt
so
much
like
ground
with
a
sort
of
interweaving
on
my
left
arm
sid
was
in
a
dark
gray
robe
looking
like
some
dismal
kind
of
monk
his
head
so
hooded
for
the
doctor
that
you
could
see
his
face
at
all
my
skull
was
my
throat
was
squeezed
dry
my
heart
was
pounding
below
that
my
body
was
empty
squirmy
yet
with
the
feeling
of
wearing
ice
cold
iron
pants
i
heard
as
if
from
two
million
miles
when
was
it
she
last
walked
and
then
an
iron
bell
somewhere
tolling
the
reply
i
guess
it
had
to
be
my
voice
coming
up
through
my
body
from
my
iron
pants
since
his
majesty
went
into
the
field
and
so
on
until
martin
had
come
on
stage
a
white
scarf
tossed
over
the
back
of
his
long
black
wig
and
a
flaring
candle
two
inches
thick
gripped
in
his
right
hand
and
dripping
wax
on
his
wrist
and
started
to
do
lady
sleepwalking
confessions
of
the
murders
of
duncan
and
banquo
and
lady
macduff
so
here
is
what
i
saw
then
without
looking
like
a
vivid
scene
that
floats
out
in
front
of
your
mind
in
a
reverie
hovering
against
a
background
of
dark
blur
and
sort
of
flashes
on
and
off
as
you
think
or
in
my
case
act
all
the
time
remember
with
sid
hand
hard
on
my
wrist
and
me
now
and
then
tolling
shakespearan
language
out
of
some
lightless
storehouse
of
memory
i
never
known
was
there
to
belong
to
me
there
was
a
glade
in
a
forest
through
the
black
branches
shone
a
dark
cold
sky
like
ashes
of
silver
early
evening
the
glade
had
two
horns
as
it
were
narrowing
back
to
either
side
and
going
off
through
the
forest
a
chilly
breeze
was
blowing
out
of
them
almost
enough
to
put
out
the
candle
its
flame
rippled
rather
far
back
in
the
horn
to
my
left
but
not
very
far
were
clumped
two
dozen
or
so
men
in
dark
cloaks
they
huddled
around
themselves
they
wore
brimmed
tallish
hats
and
pale
stuff
showing
at
their
necks
somehow
i
assumed
that
these
men
must
be
the
rude
fellows
from
the
city
i
remembered
beau
mentioning
a
million
or
so
years
ago
although
i
could
see
them
very
well
and
did
spend
much
time
on
them
there
was
one
of
them
who
had
his
hat
off
or
excitedly
pushed
way
back
showing
a
big
pale
forehead
although
that
was
all
the
conscious
impression
i
had
of
his
face
he
seemed
frighteningly
familiar
in
the
horn
to
my
right
which
was
wider
were
lined
up
about
a
dozen
horses
with
grooms
holding
tight
every
two
of
them
but
throwing
their
heads
back
now
and
then
as
they
strained
against
the
reins
and
stamping
their
front
hooves
restlessly
oh
they
frightened
me
i
tell
you
that
line
of
faces
writhing
back
their
upper
lips
from
teeth
wide
as
piano
keys
every
horse
of
them
looking
as
and
evil
as
fuseli
steed
sticking
its
head
through
the
drapes
in
his
picture
the
nightmare
to
the
center
the
trees
came
close
to
the
stage
just
in
front
of
them
was
queen
elizabeth
sitting
on
the
chair
on
the
spread
carpet
just
as
i
seen
her
out
there
before
only
now
i
could
see
that
the
braziers
were
glowing
and
redly
her
pale
cheeks
and
dark
red
hair
and
the
silver
in
her
dress
and
cloak
she
was
looking
at
martin
lady
mack
most
intently
her
mouth
grimaced
tight
twisting
her
fingers
together
standing
rather
close
around
her
were
a
half
dozen
men
with
fancier
hats
and
ruffs
and
riding
gauntlets
then
through
the
trees
and
tall
leafless
bushes
just
behind
elizabeth
i
saw
an
identical
floating
only
this
one
was
smiling
a
demonic
smile
the
eyes
were
open
very
wide
now
and
then
the
pupils
darted
rapid
glances
from
side
to
side
there
was
a
sharp
pain
in
my
left
wrist
and
sid
at
me
accustomed
action
out
of
the
corner
of
his
shadowed
mouth
i
tolled
on
obediently
it
is
an
accustomed
action
with
her
to
seem
thus
washing
her
hands
i
have
known
her
continue
in
this
a
quarter
of
an
hour
martin
had
set
down
the
candle
which
still
flared
and
guttered
on
a
little
high
table
so
firm
its
thin
legs
must
have
been
stabbed
into
the
ground
and
he
was
rubbing
his
hands
together
slowly
continually
tormentedly
trying
to
get
rid
of
duncan
blood
which
mack
knows
in
her
sleep
is
still
there
and
all
the
while
as
he
did
it
the
agitation
of
the
seated
elizabeth
grew
the
eyes
flicking
from
side
to
side
hands
writhing
he
got
to
the
lines
here
the
smell
of
blood
still
all
the
perfumes
of
arabia
will
not
sweeten
this
little
hand
oh
oh
oh
as
he
wrung
out
those
soft
tortured
sighs
elizabeth
stood
up
from
her
chair
and
took
a
step
forward
the
courtiers
moved
toward
her
quickly
but
not
touching
her
and
she
said
loudly
tis
the
blood
of
mary
stuart
whereof
she
speaks
the
pails
of
blood
that
will
gush
from
her
chopped
neck
oh
i
can
not
endure
it
and
as
she
said
that
last
she
suddenly
turned
about
and
strode
back
toward
the
trees
kicking
out
her
skirt
one
of
the
courtiers
turned
with
her
and
stooped
toward
her
closely
whispering
something
but
although
she
paused
a
moment
all
she
said
was
nay
eyes
stop
not
the
play
but
follow
me
not
nay
i
say
leave
me
leicester
and
she
walked
into
the
trees
he
looking
after
her
then
sid
was
kicking
my
ankle
and
i
was
reciting
something
and
martin
was
taking
up
his
candle
again
without
looking
at
it
saying
with
a
drugged
agitation
to
bed
to
bed
there
knocking
at
the
gate
elizabeth
came
walking
out
of
the
trees
again
her
head
bowed
she
could
have
been
in
them
ten
seconds
leicester
hurried
toward
her
hand
anxiously
outstretched
martin
moved
offstage
torturedly
yet
softly
wailing
what
done
can
not
be
undone
just
then
elizabeth
flicked
aside
leicester
hand
with
playful
contempt
and
looked
up
and
she
was
smiling
the
a
horse
whinnied
like
a
trumpeted
snicker
as
sid
and
i
started
our
last
few
lines
together
i
intoned
mechanically
letting
words
from
my
mind
to
my
tongue
all
this
time
i
had
been
answering
lady
mack
in
my
thoughts
what
you
think
viii
god
can
not
effect
that
anything
which
is
past
should
not
have
been
it
is
more
impossible
than
rising
the
dead
summa
theologica
the
moment
i
was
out
of
sight
of
the
audience
i
broke
away
from
sid
and
ran
to
the
dressing
room
i
flopped
down
on
the
first
chair
i
saw
my
head
and
arms
trailed
over
its
back
and
i
almost
passed
out
it
was
a
fit
just
normal
faint
i
could
have
been
there
long
well
not
very
long
though
the
and
alarums
of
the
last
scene
were
echoing
tinnily
from
the
stage
when
bruce
and
beau
and
mark
who
was
playing
malcolm
martin
usual
main
part
came
in
wearing
their
and
carrying
between
them
queen
elizabeth
flaccid
as
a
sack
martin
came
after
them
stripping
off
his
white
wool
nightgown
so
fast
that
buttons
flew
i
thought
automatically
have
to
sew
they
laid
her
down
on
three
chairs
set
side
by
side
and
hurried
out
unpinning
the
folded
towel
which
had
fallen
around
his
waist
martin
walked
over
and
looked
down
at
her
he
yanked
off
his
wig
by
a
braid
and
tossed
it
at
me
i
let
it
hit
me
and
fall
on
the
floor
i
was
looking
at
that
white
queenly
face
eyes
open
and
staring
sightless
at
the
ceiling
mouth
open
a
little
too
with
a
thread
of
foam
trailing
from
the
corner
and
at
that
bodice
that
never
stirred
the
blue
fly
came
buzzing
over
my
head
and
circled
down
toward
her
face
martin
i
said
with
difficulty
i
do
think
i
going
to
like
what
we
doing
he
turned
on
me
his
short
hair
elfed
his
fists
planted
high
on
his
hips
at
the
edge
of
his
black
tights
which
now
were
all
his
clothes
you
knew
he
said
impatiently
you
knew
you
were
signing
up
for
more
than
acting
when
you
said
me
in
the
company
like
a
legged
sapphire
the
blue
fly
walked
across
her
upper
lip
and
stopped
by
the
thread
of
foam
but
martin
changing
the
past
dipping
back
and
killing
the
real
queen
replacing
her
with
a
double
his
dark
brows
shot
up
the
real
you
think
this
is
the
real
queen
elizabeth
he
grabbed
a
bottle
of
rubbing
alcohol
from
the
nearest
table
gushed
some
on
a
towel
stained
with
and
holding
the
dead
head
by
its
red
hair
no
wig
the
real
one
wore
a
wig
too
scrubbed
the
forehead
the
white
cosmetic
came
away
showing
sallow
skin
and
on
it
a
faint
tattoo
in
the
form
of
an
s
styled
like
a
symbol
left
a
little
open
snake
he
hissed
destroyer
the
the
eternal
opponent
god
knows
how
many
times
people
like
queen
elizabeth
have
been
dug
out
of
the
past
first
by
snakes
then
by
spiders
and
kidnapped
or
killed
and
replaced
in
the
course
of
our
war
this
is
the
first
big
operation
i
been
on
greta
but
i
know
that
much
my
head
began
to
ache
i
asked
if
she
an
enemy
double
why
she
know
a
performance
of
macbeth
in
her
lifetime
was
an
anachronism
foxholed
in
the
past
only
trying
to
hold
a
position
they
get
dulled
they
turn
half
zombie
even
the
snakes
even
our
people
besides
she
almost
did
catch
on
twice
when
she
spoke
to
leicester
martin
i
said
dully
if
there
been
all
these
replacements
first
by
them
then
by
us
what
happened
to
the
elizabeth
he
shrugged
god
knows
i
asked
softly
but
does
he
martin
can
he
he
hugged
his
shoulders
in
as
if
to
contain
a
shudder
look
greta
he
said
it
the
snakes
who
are
the
warpers
and
destroyers
restoring
the
past
the
spiders
are
trying
to
keep
things
as
first
created
we
only
kill
when
we
must
shuddered
then
for
bursting
out
of
my
memory
came
the
glittering
bloody
image
of
my
lover
the
spider
erich
von
hohenwald
dying
in
the
grip
of
a
giant
silver
spider
or
entity
large
as
he
as
they
rolled
in
a
tangled
ball
down
a
flight
of
rocks
in
central
park
but
the
did
blow
up
my
mind
as
it
had
done
a
year
ago
no
more
than
snapping
the
black
thread
from
my
sweater
had
ended
the
world
i
asked
martin
is
that
what
the
snakes
say
of
course
not
they
make
the
same
claims
we
do
but
somewhere
greta
you
have
to
he
put
out
the
middle
finger
of
his
hand
i
did
take
hold
of
it
he
whirled
it
away
snapping
it
against
his
thumb
you
still
grieving
for
that
carrion
there
he
accused
me
he
jerked
down
a
section
of
white
curtain
and
whirled
it
over
the
stiffening
body
if
you
must
grieve
grieve
for
miss
nefer
exiled
imprisoned
locked
forever
in
the
past
her
mind
pulsing
faintly
in
the
black
hole
of
the
dead
and
gone
yearning
for
nirvana
yet
nursing
one
lone
painful
patch
of
consciousness
and
only
to
hold
a
fort
only
to
make
sure
mary
stuart
is
executed
the
armada
licked
and
that
all
the
other
consequences
flow
on
the
snakes
elizabeth
let
mary
live
and
england
die
and
the
spaniard
hold
north
america
to
the
great
lakes
and
new
scandinavia
once
more
he
put
out
his
middle
finger
all
right
all
right
i
said
barely
touching
it
you
convinced
me
great
he
said
for
now
greta
i
got
to
help
strike
the
set
that
good
i
said
he
loped
out
i
could
hear
the
skirling
of
the
final
fight
to
the
death
of
the
two
macks
duff
and
beth
but
i
only
sat
there
in
the
empty
dressing
room
pretending
to
grieve
for
a
snow
tiger
locked
in
a
and
for
a
cute
sardonic
german
killed
for
insubordination
that
had
reported
but
really
grieving
for
a
girl
who
for
a
year
had
been
a
rootless
child
of
the
theater
with
a
whole
company
of
mothers
and
fathers
afraid
of
nothing
more
than
subway
bogies
and
park
and
village
monsters
as
i
sat
there
pitying
myself
beside
a
shrouded
queen
a
shadow
fell
across
my
knees
i
saw
stealing
through
the
dressing
room
a
young
man
in
worn
dark
clothes
he
could
have
been
more
than
he
was
a
frail
sort
of
guy
with
a
weak
chin
and
big
forehead
and
eyes
that
saw
everything
i
knew
at
one
he
was
the
one
who
had
seemed
familiar
to
me
in
the
knot
of
city
fellows
he
looked
at
me
and
i
looked
from
him
to
the
picture
sitting
on
the
reserve
makeup
box
by
siddy
mirror
and
i
began
to
tremble
he
looked
at
it
too
of
course
as
fast
as
i
did
and
then
he
began
to
tremble
too
though
it
was
a
tremor
than
mine
the
had
ended
seconds
back
and
now
i
heard
the
witches
faintly
wailing
fair
is
foul
and
foul
is
fair
sid
has
them
echo
that
line
offstage
at
the
end
to
give
a
feeling
of
prophecy
fulfilled
then
sid
came
pounding
up
he
the
first
finished
since
the
fight
ends
offstage
so
macduff
can
carry
back
a
head
of
him
and
show
it
to
the
audience
sid
stopped
dead
in
the
door
then
the
stranger
turned
around
his
shoulders
jerked
as
he
saw
sid
he
moved
toward
him
just
two
or
three
steps
at
a
time
speaking
at
the
same
time
in
breathy
little
rushes
sid
stood
there
and
watched
him
when
the
other
actors
came
boiling
up
behind
him
he
put
his
hands
on
the
doorframe
to
either
side
so
none
of
them
could
get
past
their
faces
peered
around
him
and
all
this
while
the
stranger
was
saying
what
may
this
mean
can
such
things
be
are
all
the
seeds
of
time
wetted
by
some
sprouted
at
once
in
their
granary
speak
speak
you
played
me
a
play
that
i
am
writing
in
my
secretest
heart
have
you
disjointed
the
frame
of
things
to
steal
my
unborn
thoughts
fair
is
foul
indeed
is
all
the
world
a
stage
speak
i
say
are
you
not
my
friend
sidney
james
lessingham
of
king
lynn
singed
by
time
fiery
wand
sifted
over
with
the
ashes
of
thirty
years
speak
are
you
not
he
oh
there
are
more
things
in
heaven
and
earth
aye
and
perchance
hell
too
speak
i
charge
you
and
with
that
he
put
his
hands
on
sid
shoulders
half
to
shake
him
i
think
but
half
to
keep
from
falling
over
and
for
the
one
time
i
ever
saw
it
glib
old
siddy
had
nothing
to
say
he
worked
his
lips
he
opened
his
mouth
twice
and
twice
shut
it
then
with
a
kind
of
desperation
in
his
face
he
motioned
the
actors
out
of
the
way
behind
him
with
one
big
arm
and
swung
the
other
around
the
stranger
narrow
shoulders
and
swept
him
out
of
the
dressing
room
himself
following
the
actors
came
pouring
in
then
bruce
tossing
macbeth
head
to
martin
like
a
football
while
he
tugged
off
his
horned
helmet
mark
dumping
a
stack
of
shields
in
the
corner
maudie
pausing
as
she
skittered
past
me
to
say
hi
gret
great
you
back
and
patting
my
temple
to
show
what
part
of
me
she
meant
beau
went
straight
to
dressing
table
and
set
the
portrait
aside
and
lifted
out
sid
reserve
makeup
box
the
lights
martin
he
called
then
sid
came
back
in
slamming
and
bolting
the
door
behind
him
and
standing
for
a
moment
with
his
back
against
it
panting
i
rushed
to
him
something
was
boiling
up
inside
me
but
before
it
could
get
to
my
brain
i
opened
my
mouth
and
it
came
out
as
siddy
you
ca
fool
me
that
was
no
dirty
i
do
care
how
much
he
shakes
and
purrs
or
shakes
a
spear
or
just
plain
shakes
siddy
that
was
shakespeare
aye
girl
i
think
so
he
told
me
holding
my
wrists
together
they
ca
find
dolls
to
double
men
like
that
or
such
is
my
main
hope
a
big
sickly
grin
came
on
his
face
oh
gods
he
demanded
with
what
words
do
you
talk
to
a
man
whose
speech
you
stolen
all
your
life
i
asked
him
sid
were
we
in
central
park
he
answered
once
twelve
months
back
a
stand
they
came
for
erich
you
flipped
he
swung
me
aside
and
moved
behind
beau
all
the
lights
went
out
then
i
saw
dimly
at
first
the
great
jewel
covered
with
dials
and
windows
that
beau
had
lifted
from
reserve
makeup
box
the
strongest
green
glow
showed
his
intent
face
still
framed
by
the
long
glistening
locks
of
the
ross
wig
as
he
kneeled
before
the
thing
major
maintainer
i
remembered
it
was
called
when
now
where
beau
tossed
impatiently
to
sid
over
his
shoulder
the
year
before
our
lord
birth
sid
answered
instantly
rome
beau
fingers
danced
over
the
dials
like
a
musician
or
a
the
green
glow
flared
and
faded
flickeringly
there
a
storm
in
that
vector
of
the
void
circle
it
sid
ordered
there
are
dark
mists
every
way
then
pick
the
likeliest
dark
path
i
called
through
the
dark
fair
is
foul
and
foul
is
fair
