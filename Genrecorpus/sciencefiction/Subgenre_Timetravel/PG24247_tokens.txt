gun
is
an
interesting
weapon
it
can
be
hired
of
course
and
naturally
does
care
who
hires
it
something
much
the
same
can
be
said
of
the
gunman
too

for
hire

joe
prantera
called
softly
al
the
pleasurable
comfortable
warm
feeling
began
spreading
over
him
the
way
it
always
did
the
older
man
stopped
and
squinted
but
not
suspiciously
even
now
the
evening
was
dark
it
was
unlikely
that
the
other
even
saw
the
circle
of
steel
that
was
the
mouth
of
the
shotgun
barrel
now
resting
on
the
car
window
ledge
who
it
he
growled
joe
prantera
said
softly
big
louis
sent
me
al
and
he
pressed
the
trigger
and
at
that
moment
the
universe
caved
inward
upon
joseph
marie
prantera
there
was
nausea
and
nausea
upon
nausea
there
was
a
falling
through
all
space
and
through
all
time
there
was
doubling
and
twisting
and
twitching
of
every
muscle
and
nerve
there
was
pain
horror
and
tumultuous
fear
and
he
came
out
of
it
as
quickly
and
completely
as
he
gone
in
he
was
in
he
thought
a
hospital
and
his
first
reaction
was
to
think
here
california
everything
then
his
second
thought
was
went
wrong
big
louis
he
ai
going
to
like
illustration
he
brought
his
thinking
to
the
present
so
far
as
he
could
remember
he
had
completely
pulled
the
trigger
that
at
least
meant
that
whatever
the
rap
was
it
would
be
too
tough
with
luck
the
syndicate
would
get
him
off
with
a
couple
of
years
at
quentin
a
door
slid
open
in
the
wall
in
a
way
that
joe
had
never
seen
a
door
operate
before
here
the
clothes
on
the
newcomer
were
wrong
too
for
the
first
time
joe
prantera
began
to
sense
an
alienness
a
something
that
was
awfully
wrong
the
other
spoke
precisely
and
slowly
the
way
a
highly
educated
man
speaks
a
language
which
he
reads
and
writes
fluently
but
has
little
occasion
to
practice
vocally
you
have
recovered
joe
prantera
looked
at
the
other
expressionlessly
maybe
the
old
duck
was
one
of
these
foreign
doctors
like
the
newcomer
said
you
have
undoubtedly
been
through
a
most
harrowing
experience
if
you
have
any
untoward
symptoms
possibly
i
could
be
of
assistance
joe
could
figure
out
how
he
stood
for
one
thing
there
should
have
been
some
kind
of
police
guard
the
other
said
perhaps
a
bit
of
stimulant
joe
said
flatly
i
wanta
lawyer
the
newcomer
frowned
at
him
a
lawyer
i
not
sayin
nothin
not
until
i
get
a
mouthpiece
the
newcomer
started
off
on
another
tack
my
name
is
lawrence
if
i
am
not
mistaken
you
are
joseph
salviati
happened
to
be
joe
mother
maiden
name
but
it
was
unlikely
this
character
could
have
known
that
joe
had
been
born
in
naples
and
his
mother
had
died
in
childbirth
his
father
had
brought
him
to
the
states
until
the
age
of
five
and
by
that
time
he
had
a
stepmother
i
wanta
mouthpiece
joe
said
flatly
or
let
me
outta
here
lawrence
said
you
are
not
being
constrained
there
are
clothes
for
you
in
the
closet
there
joe
gingerly
tried
swinging
his
feet
to
the
floor
and
sitting
up
while
the
other
stood
watching
him
strangely
he
came
to
his
feet
with
the
exception
of
a
faint
nausea
which
brought
back
memories
of
that
extreme
condition
he
suffered
during
during
what
he
had
the
vaguest
idea
of
what
had
happened
he
was
dressed
in
a
nightgown
he
looked
down
at
it
and
snorted
and
made
his
way
over
to
the
closet
it
opened
on
his
approach
the
door
sliding
back
into
the
wall
in
much
the
same
manner
as
the
room
door
had
opened
for
joe
prantera
scowled
and
said
these
ai
my
clothes
no
i
am
afraid
not
you
think
i
be
seen
dead
wearing
this
stuff
what
is
this
some
religious
crackpot
hospital
said
i
am
afraid
that
these
are
the
only
garments
available
i
suggest
you
look
out
the
window
there
joe
gave
him
a
long
chill
look
and
then
stepped
to
the
window
he
could
figure
the
other
unless
he
was
a
fruitcake
maybe
he
was
in
some
kind
of
pressure
cooker
and
this
was
one
of
the
fruitcakes
he
looked
out
however
not
on
the
lawns
and
walks
of
a
sanitarium
but
upon
a
wide
boulevard
of
what
was
obviously
a
populous
city
and
for
a
moment
again
joe
prantera
felt
the
depths
of
nausea
this
was
not
his
world
he
stared
for
a
long
long
moment
the
cars
did
even
have
wheels
he
noted
dully
he
turned
slowly
and
faced
the
older
man
said
compassionately
try
this
it
excellent
cognac
joe
prantera
stared
at
him
said
finally
flatly
what
it
all
about
the
other
put
down
the
unaccepted
glass
we
were
afraid
first
realization
would
be
a
shock
to
you
he
said
my
colleague
is
in
the
adjoining
room
we
will
be
glad
to
explain
to
you
if
you
will
join
us
there
i
wanta
get
out
of
here
joe
said
where
would
you
go
the
fear
of
police
of
al
rossi
vengeance
of
the
measures
that
might
be
taken
by
big
louis
on
his
failure
were
now
far
away
had
approached
the
door
by
which
he
had
entered
and
it
reopened
for
him
he
went
through
it
without
looking
back
there
was
nothing
else
to
do
joe
dressed
then
followed
him
in
the
adjoining
room
was
a
circular
table
that
would
have
accommodated
a
dozen
persons
two
were
seated
there
now
papers
books
and
soiled
coffee
cups
before
them
there
had
evidently
been
a
long
wait
the
one
joe
had
already
met
was
tall
and
drawn
of
face
and
with
a
chainsmoker
nervousness
the
other
was
heavier
and
more
at
ease
they
were
both
joe
estimated
somewhere
in
their
middle
fifties
they
both
looked
like
docs
he
wondered
all
over
again
if
this
was
some
kind
of
pressure
cooker
but
that
did
explain
the
view
from
the
window
said
may
i
present
my
colleague
citizen
warren
warren
this
is
our
guest
from
from
yesteryear
joseph
nodded
to
him
friendly
so
far
as
joe
could
see
he
said
gently
i
think
it
would
be
joseph
prantera
would
it
the
maternal
linage
was
almost
universally
ignored
his
voice
too
gave
the
impression
he
was
speaking
a
language
not
usually
on
his
tongue
joe
took
an
empty
chair
hardly
bothering
to
note
its
alien
qualities
his
body
seemed
to
into
the
piece
of
furniture
as
though
it
had
been
molded
to
his
order
joe
said
i
think
maybe
i
take
that
there
drink
doc
said
of
course
and
then
something
else
joe
get
whatever
the
something
else
was
a
slot
opened
in
the
middle
of
the
table
and
a
glass
so
clear
of
texture
as
to
be
all
but
invisible
was
elevated
it
contained
possibly
three
ounces
of
golden
fluid
joe
did
allow
himself
to
think
of
its
means
of
delivery
he
took
up
the
drink
and
bolted
it
he
put
the
glass
down
and
said
carefully
what
it
all
about
huh
warren
said
soothingly
prepare
yourself
for
somewhat
of
a
shock
prantera
you
are
no
longer
in
los
angeles
ya
think
i
stupid
i
can
see
that
i
was
about
to
say
los
angeles
of
prantera
we
welcome
you
to
nuevo
los
angeles
ta
where
to
nuevo
los
angeles
and
to
the
year
looked
at
his
companion
what
is
the
date
old
calendar
said
they
would
say
joe
prantera
looked
from
one
of
them
to
the
other
scowling
what
are
you
guys
talking
about
warren
said
softly
prantera
you
are
no
longer
in
the
year
you
are
now
in
the
year
he
said
uncomprehendingly
you
mean
i
been
like
unconscious
for
he
let
the
sentence
fall
away
as
he
realized
the
impossibility
said
gently
hardly
for
one
hundred
and
seventy
years
mr
prantera
said
i
am
afraid
we
are
confusing
you
briefly
we
have
you
i
suppose
one
might
say
from
your
own
era
to
ours
joe
prantera
had
never
been
exposed
to
the
concept
of
time
travel
he
had
simply
never
associated
with
anyone
who
had
ever
even
remotely
considered
such
an
idea
now
he
said
you
mean
like
i
been
asleep
all
that
time
not
exactly
said
frowning
said
suffice
to
say
you
are
now
one
hundred
and
years
after
the
last
memory
you
have
joe
prantera
mind
suddenly
reverted
to
those
last
memories
and
his
eyes
narrowed
dangerously
he
felt
suddenly
at
bay
he
said
maybe
you
guys
better
let
me
in
on
what
this
all
about
said
prantera
we
have
brought
you
from
your
era
to
perform
a
task
for
us
joe
stared
at
him
and
then
at
the
other
he
could
believe
he
was
getting
through
to
them
or
at
least
that
they
were
to
him
finally
he
said
if
i
get
this
you
want
me
to
do
a
job
for
you
that
is
correct
joe
said
you
guys
know
the
kind
of
jobs
i
do
that
is
correct
like
hell
you
do
you
think
i
stupid
i
never
even
seen
you
before
joe
prantera
came
abruptly
to
his
feet
i
gettin
outta
here
for
the
second
time
said
where
would
you
go
mr
prantera
joe
glared
at
him
then
sat
down
again
as
abruptly
as
he
arisen
let
start
all
over
again
i
got
this
straight
you
brought
me
some
screwy
way
all
the
way
here
i
buy
that
i
seen
what
it
looks
like
out
that
window
the
real
comprehension
was
seeping
through
to
him
even
as
he
talked
everybody
i
know
jessie
tony
the
kid
big
louis
everybody
they
dead
even
big
louis
yes
said
his
voice
soft
they
are
all
dead
prantera
their
children
are
all
dead
and
their
grandchildren
the
two
men
of
the
future
said
nothing
more
for
long
minutes
while
joe
prantera
mind
whirled
its
confusion
finally
he
said
what
this
bit
about
you
wanting
me
to
give
it
to
some
guy
that
is
why
we
brought
you
here
prantera
you
were
you
are
a
professional
assassin
hey
wait
a
minute
now
went
on
ignoring
the
interruption
there
is
small
point
in
denying
your
calling
pray
remember
that
at
the
point
when
we
you
you
were
about
to
dispose
of
a
contemporary
named
alphonso
a
citizen
i
might
say
whose
demise
would
probably
have
caused
small
dismay
to
society
they
had
him
pegged
all
right
joe
said
but
why
me
why
do
you
get
some
heavy
from
now
somebody
knows
the
ropes
these
days
said
prantera
there
are
no
professional
assassins
in
this
age
nor
have
there
been
for
over
a
century
and
a
half
well
then
do
it
yourself
joe
prantera
irritation
over
this
whole
complicated
mess
was
growing
and
already
he
was
beginning
to
long
for
the
things
he
knew
for
jessie
and
tony
and
the
others
for
his
favorite
bar
for
the
lasagne
down
at
papa
giovanni
right
now
he
could
have
welcomed
a
calling
down
at
the
hands
of
big
louis
had
come
to
his
feet
and
walked
to
one
of
the
large
room
windows
he
looked
out
as
though
unseeing
then
his
back
turned
he
said
we
have
tried
but
it
is
simply
not
in
us
mr
prantera
you
mean
you
yella
no
if
by
that
you
mean
afraid
it
is
simply
not
within
us
to
take
the
life
of
a
fellow
creature
not
to
speak
of
a
fellow
man
joe
snapped
everything
you
guys
say
sounds
crazy
let
start
all
over
again
said
let
me
do
it
lawrence
he
turned
his
eyes
to
joe
prantera
in
your
own
era
did
you
ever
consider
the
future
joe
looked
at
him
blankly
in
your
day
you
were
confronted
with
national
and
international
problems
just
as
we
are
today
and
just
as
nations
were
a
century
or
a
millennium
ago
sure
so
we
had
problems
i
know
whatcha
mean
like
wars
and
depressions
and
dictators
and
like
that
yes
like
that
nodded
the
man
paused
a
moment
yes
like
that
he
repeated
that
we
confront
you
now
indicates
that
the
problems
of
your
day
were
solved
had
they
been
the
world
most
surely
would
have
destroyed
itself
wars
our
pedagogues
are
hard
put
to
convince
their
students
that
such
ever
existed
more
than
a
century
and
a
half
ago
our
society
eliminated
the
reasons
for
international
conflict
for
that
matter
he
added
musingly
we
eliminated
most
international
boundaries
depressions
shortly
after
your
own
period
man
awoke
to
the
fact
that
he
had
achieved
to
the
point
where
it
was
possible
to
produce
an
abundance
for
all
with
a
minimum
of
toil
overnight
for
all
practical
purposes
the
whole
world
was
industrialized
automated
the
second
industrial
revolution
was
accompanied
by
revolutionary
changes
in
almost
every
field
certainly
in
every
science
dictators
your
ancestors
found
prantera
that
it
is
difficult
for
a
man
to
be
free
so
long
as
others
are
still
enslaved
today
the
democratic
ethic
has
reached
a
pinnacle
never
dreamed
of
in
your
own
era
joe
prantera
growled
so
everybody
got
it
made
what
i
wanta
know
is
what
all
this
about
me
giving
it
ta
somebody
if
everything
so
great
how
come
you
want
me
to
knock
this
guy
off
bent
forward
and
thumped
his
right
index
finger
twice
on
the
table
the
bacterium
of
hate
a
new
strain
has
found
the
human
race
unprotected
from
its
disease
we
had
thought
our
vaccines
immunized
us
what
that
suppose
to
mean
took
up
the
ball
again
prantera
have
you
ever
heard
of
ghengis
khan
of
tamerlane
alexander
caesar
joe
prantera
scowled
at
him
emptily
or
more
likely
of
napoleon
hitler
stalin
sure
i
heard
of
hitler
and
stalin
joe
growled
i
ai
stupid
the
other
nodded
such
men
are
unique
they
have
a
drive
a
drive
to
power
which
exceeds
by
far
the
ambitions
of
the
average
man
they
are
genii
in
their
way
prantera
genii
of
evil
such
a
genius
of
evil
has
appeared
on
the
current
scene
now
we
getting
somewheres
joe
snorted
so
you
got
a
guy
what
a
little
ambitious
like
eh
and
you
guys
ai
got
the
guts
to
give
it
to
him
what
in
it
for
me
the
two
of
them
frowned
exchanged
glances
said
you
know
that
is
one
aspect
we
had
not
considered
said
to
joe
prantera
had
we
not
ah
taken
you
at
the
time
we
did
do
you
realize
what
would
have
happened
sure
joe
grunted
i
woulda
let
old
al
rossi
have
it
right
in
the
guts
five
times
then
i
woulda
took
the
plane
back
to
chi
was
shaking
his
head
no
you
see
by
coincidence
a
police
squad
car
was
coming
down
the
street
just
at
that
moment
to
arrest
rossi
you
would
have
been
apprehended
as
i
understand
californian
law
of
the
period
your
life
would
have
been
forfeit
mr
prantera
joe
winced
it
did
occur
to
him
to
doubt
their
word
said
as
to
reward
prantera
we
have
already
told
you
there
is
in
this
age
once
this
task
has
been
performed
we
will
sponsor
your
entry
into
present
day
society
competent
psychiatric
therapy
will
soon
remove
your
present
waita
minute
now
you
figure
on
gettin
me
candled
by
some
head
shrinker
eh
no
thanks
buster
i
going
back
to
my
own
was
shaking
his
head
again
i
am
afraid
there
is
no
return
prantera
time
travel
works
but
in
one
direction
the
flow
of
the
time
stream
there
can
be
no
return
to
your
own
era
joe
prantera
had
been
rocking
with
the
mental
blows
he
had
been
assimilating
but
this
was
the
final
haymaker
he
was
stuck
in
this
squaresville
of
a
world
joe
prantera
on
a
job
was
thorough
careful
painstaking
competent
he
spent
the
first
three
days
of
his
life
in
the
year
getting
the
feel
of
things
and
had
been
appointed
to
work
with
him
joe
did
meet
any
of
the
others
who
belonged
to
the
group
which
had
taken
the
measures
to
bring
him
from
the
past
he
want
to
meet
them
the
fewer
persons
involved
the
better
he
stayed
in
the
apartment
of
joe
had
been
right
was
a
medical
doctor
evidently
had
something
to
do
with
the
process
that
had
enabled
them
to
bring
joe
from
the
past
joe
did
know
how
they
done
it
and
he
did
care
joe
was
a
realist
he
was
here
the
thing
was
to
adapt
there
did
seem
to
be
any
hurry
once
the
deal
was
made
they
left
it
up
to
him
to
make
the
decisions
they
drove
him
around
the
town
when
he
wished
to
check
the
traffic
arteries
they
flew
him
about
the
whole
vicinity
from
the
air
southern
california
looked
much
the
same
as
it
had
in
his
own
time
oceans
mountains
and
to
a
lesser
extent
deserts
are
fairly
permanent
even
against
man
corroding
efforts
it
was
while
he
was
flying
with
on
the
second
day
that
joe
said
how
about
mexico
could
i
make
the
get
to
mexico
the
physicist
looked
at
him
questioningly
get
he
said
joe
prantera
said
impatiently
the
getaway
after
i
give
it
to
this
howard
guy
i
got
ta
go
on
the
run
do
i
i
see
cleared
his
throat
mexico
is
no
longer
a
separate
nation
prantera
all
north
america
has
been
united
into
one
unit
today
there
are
only
eight
nations
in
the
world
where
the
nearest
south
america
that
a
helluva
long
way
to
go
on
a
get
we
had
thought
of
the
matter
being
handled
in
that
manner
joe
eyed
him
in
scorn
oh
you
did
huh
what
happens
after
i
give
it
to
this
guy
i
just
sit
around
and
wait
for
the
cops
to
put
the
arm
on
me
grimaced
in
amusement
prantera
this
will
probably
be
difficult
for
you
to
comprehend
but
there
are
no
police
in
this
era
joe
gaped
at
him
no
police
what
happens
if
you
got
ta
throw
some
guy
in
stir
if
i
understand
your
idiom
correctly
you
mean
prison
there
are
no
prisons
in
this
era
mr
prantera
joe
stared
no
cops
no
jails
what
stops
anybody
what
stops
anybody
from
just
going
into
some
bank
like
and
collecting
up
all
the
bread
cleared
his
throat
prantera
there
are
no
banks
no
banks
you
got
ta
have
banks
and
no
money
to
put
in
them
we
found
it
a
rather
antiquated
method
of
distribution
well
over
a
century
ago
joe
had
given
up
now
he
merely
stared
said
reasonably
we
found
we
were
devoting
as
much
time
to
financial
matters
in
all
their
endless
ramifications
including
bank
robberies
as
we
were
to
productive
efforts
so
we
turned
to
more
efficient
methods
of
distribution
on
the
fourth
day
joe
said
let
get
down
to
facts
summa
the
things
you
guys
say
do
stick
together
so
good
now
first
place
where
this
guy
you
want
knocked
off
and
were
both
present
the
three
of
them
sat
in
the
living
room
of
the
latter
apartment
sipping
a
sparkling
wine
which
seemed
to
be
the
prevailing
beverage
of
the
day
for
joe
taste
it
was
insipid
stuff
happily
rye
was
available
to
those
who
wanted
it
said
you
mean
where
does
he
reside
why
here
in
this
city
well
that
handy
eh
joe
scratched
himself
thoughtfully
you
got
somebody
can
finger
him
for
me
finger
him
look
before
i
can
give
it
to
this
guy
i
got
ta
know
some
place
where
he
be
at
some
time
get
it
like
al
rossi
my
finger
he
works
in
rossi
house
see
he
lets
me
know
every
wednesday
night
eight
al
leaves
the
house
all
by
hisself
so
i
can
make
plans
like
to
give
it
to
him
joe
prantera
wound
it
up
reasonably
you
got
ta
have
a
finger
said
why
not
just
go
to
apartment
and
ah
dispose
of
him
jest
walk
in
eh
you
think
i
stupid
how
do
i
know
how
many
witnesses
hangin
around
how
do
i
know
if
the
guy
carryin
heat
heat
a
gun
a
gun
ya
think
i
stupid
i
come
to
give
it
to
him
and
he
gives
it
to
me
instead
said
howard
lives
alone
he
customarily
receives
visitors
every
afternoon
largely
potential
followers
he
is
attempting
to
recruit
members
to
an
organization
he
is
forming
it
would
be
quite
simple
for
you
to
enter
his
establishment
and
dispose
of
him
i
assure
you
he
does
not
possess
weapons
joe
was
indignant
just
like
that
eh
he
said
sarcastically
then
what
happens
how
do
i
get
out
of
the
building
where
my
get
car
parked
where
do
i
hide
out
where
do
i
dump
the
heat
dump
the
heat
get
rid
of
the
gun
you
want
i
should
get
caught
with
the
gun
on
me
i
wind
up
in
the
gas
chamber
so
quick
see
here
prantera
said
softly
we
no
longer
have
capital
punishment
you
must
realize
i
still
do
wanta
get
caught
what
the
rap
these
days
huh
joe
scowled
you
said
they
did
have
no
jails
any
more
this
is
difficult
for
you
to
understand
i
imagine
told
him
but
you
see
we
no
longer
punish
people
in
this
era
that
took
a
long
unbelieving
moment
to
sink
in
you
mean
like
no
matter
what
they
do
that
crazy
everybody
be
running
around
giving
it
to
everybody
else
the
motivation
for
crime
has
been
removed
prantera
attempted
to
explain
a
person
who
commits
a
violence
against
another
is
obviously
in
need
of
medical
care
and
consequently
receives
it
you
mean
like
if
i
steal
a
car
or
something
they
just
take
me
to
a
doctor
joe
prantera
was
unbelieving
why
would
anybody
wish
to
steal
a
car
said
easily
but
if
i
to
somebody
you
will
be
turned
over
to
a
medical
institution
citizen
howard
is
the
last
man
you
will
ever
kill
mr
prantera
a
chillness
was
in
the
belly
of
joe
prantera
he
said
very
slowly
very
dangerously
you
guys
figure
on
me
getting
caught
do
you
yes
said
evenly
well
then
figure
something
else
you
think
i
stupid
prantera
said
there
has
been
as
much
progress
in
the
field
of
psychiatry
in
the
past
two
centuries
as
there
has
in
any
other
your
treatment
would
be
brief
and
painless
believe
me
joe
said
coldly
and
what
happens
to
you
guys
how
do
you
know
i
rat
on
you
said
gently
the
moment
after
you
have
accomplished
your
mission
we
plan
to
turn
ourselves
over
to
the
nearest
institution
to
have
determined
whether
or
not
we
also
need
therapy
now
i
beginning
to
wonder
about
you
guys
joe
said
look
all
over
again
wanta
give
it
to
this
guy
for
the
doctor
said
we
explained
the
other
day
prantera
citizen
howard
is
a
dangerous
atavistic
evil
genius
we
are
afraid
for
our
institutions
if
his
plans
are
allowed
to
mature
well
if
you
got
things
so
good
everybody
got
it
made
like
listen
to
him
the
doctor
nodded
at
the
validity
of
the
question
prantera
is
a
unique
animal
physically
he
matures
at
approximately
the
age
of
thirteen
however
mental
maturity
and
adjustment
is
often
not
fully
realized
until
thirty
or
even
more
indeed
it
is
sometimes
never
achieved
before
such
maturity
is
reached
our
youth
are
susceptible
to
romantic
appeal
nationalism
chauvinism
racism
the
supposed
glory
of
the
military
all
seem
romantic
to
the
immature
they
rebel
at
the
orderliness
of
present
society
they
seek
entertainment
in
excitement
citizen
is
aware
of
this
and
finds
his
recruits
among
the
young
so
this
guy
is
dangerous
you
want
him
knocked
off
before
he
screws
everything
up
but
the
way
things
are
there
no
way
of
making
a
get
so
you
have
to
get
some
other
patsy
not
me
i
am
afraid
you
have
no
alternative
said
gently
without
us
what
will
you
do
prantera
you
do
not
even
speak
the
language
mean
i
do
understand
summa
the
big
words
you
eggheads
use
but
i
get
by
said
is
no
longer
the
language
spoken
by
the
man
in
the
street
prantera
only
students
of
such
subjects
any
longer
speak
such
tongues
as
french
russian
or
the
many
others
that
once
confused
the
race
with
their
limitations
as
a
means
of
communication
you
mean
there
no
place
in
the
whole
world
where
they
talk
american
joe
demanded
aghast
controlled
the
car
joe
prantera
sat
in
the
seat
next
to
him
and
warren
sat
in
the
back
joe
had
tucked
in
his
belt
a
caliber
automatic
once
displayed
in
a
museum
it
had
been
more
easily
procured
than
the
ammunition
to
fit
it
but
that
problem
too
had
been
solved
the
others
were
nervous
obviously
repelled
by
the
very
conception
of
what
they
had
planned
inwardly
joe
was
amused
now
that
they
had
got
in
the
clutch
the
others
were
on
the
verge
of
chickening
out
he
knew
it
would
have
taken
much
for
them
to
cancel
the
project
it
was
any
answer
though
if
they
allowed
him
to
call
it
off
today
they
talk
themselves
into
it
again
before
the
week
was
through
besides
already
joe
was
beginning
to
feel
the
comfortable
pleasurable
warm
feeling
that
came
to
him
on
occasions
like
this
he
said
you
sure
this
guy
talks
american
eh
warren
said
quite
sure
he
is
a
student
of
history
and
he
wo
think
it
funny
i
talk
american
to
him
eh
he
undoubtedly
be
intrigued
they
pulled
up
before
a
large
apartment
building
that
overlooked
the
area
once
known
as
wilmington
joe
was
coolly
efficient
now
he
pulled
out
the
automatic
held
it
down
below
his
knees
and
threw
a
shell
into
the
barrel
he
eased
the
hammer
down
thumbed
on
the
safety
stuck
the
weapon
back
in
his
belt
and
beneath
the
jacketlike
garment
he
wore
he
said
see
you
guys
later
he
left
them
and
entered
the
building
an
elevator
he
still
was
used
to
their
speed
in
this
era
whooshed
him
to
the
penthouse
duplex
occupied
by
citizen
howard
there
were
two
persons
in
the
reception
room
but
they
left
on
arrival
without
bothering
to
look
at
him
more
than
glancingly
he
spotted
the
screen
immediately
and
went
over
and
stood
before
it
the
screen
lit
and
revealed
a
dour
of
countenance
man
seated
at
a
desk
he
looked
into
joe
prantera
face
scowled
and
said
something
joe
said
joseph
to
interview
citizen
howard
the
other
shaggy
eyebrows
rose
indeed
he
said
in
joe
nodded
enter
the
other
said
a
door
had
slid
open
on
the
other
side
of
the
room
joe
walked
through
it
and
into
what
was
obviously
an
office
citizen
sat
at
a
desk
there
was
only
one
other
chair
in
the
room
joe
prantera
ignored
it
and
remained
standing
citizen
said
what
can
i
do
for
you
joe
looked
at
him
for
a
long
long
moment
then
he
reached
down
to
his
belt
and
brought
forth
the
automatic
he
moistened
his
lips
joe
said
softly
you
know
what
this
here
is

at
the
weapon

a
handgun
circa
i
would

appraisingly
perhaps
he
said
