to
those
thoughtful
persians
who
can
read
a
warning
in
the
sudden
rise
and
swift
extinction
of
a
foolish
people
this
volume
is
dedicated
a
few
words
by
hedful
surnamed
the
axis
of
wisdom
of
the
imperial
museum
at
of
the
celestial
conquest
of
and
northern
mehrika
under
the
rulers
the
astounding
discoveries
of
of
have
thrown
floods
of
light
upon
the
domestic
life
of
the
mehrikan
people
he
little
realized
when
he
landed
upon
that
sleeping
continent
what
a
service
he
was
about
to
render
history
or
what
enthusiasm
his
discoveries
would
arouse
among
persian
archæologists
every
student
of
antiquity
is
familiar
with
these
facts
but
for
the
benefit
of
those
who
have
yet
to
acquire
a
knowledge
of
this
extraordinary
people
i
advise
first
a
visit
to
the
museum
at
teheran
in
order
to
excite
their
interest
in
the
subject
and
second
the
reading
of
such
books
as
nōfūhl
what
we
found
in
the
west
and
history
of
the
mehrikans
the
is
a
complete
and
reliable
history
of
these
people
from
the
birth
of
the
republic
under
to
the
year
when
they
ceased
to
exist
as
a
nation
i
must
say
however
that
leaves
the
reader
much
confused
concerning
the
period
between
the
massacre
of
the
protestants
in
and
the
overflow
of
the
murfey
dynasty
in
he
holds
the
opinion
with
many
other
historians
that
the
mehrikans
were
a
mongrel
race
with
little
or
no
patriotism
and
were
purely
imitative
simply
an
enlarged
copy
of
other
nationalities
extant
at
the
time
he
pronounces
them
a
shallow
nervous
extravagant
people
and
accords
them
but
few
redeeming
virtues
this
of
course
is
just
but
nevertheless
they
will
always
be
an
interesting
study
by
reason
of
their
rapid
growth
their
vast
numbers
their
marvellous
mechanical
ingenuity
and
their
sudden
and
almost
unaccountable
disappearance
the
wealth
luxury
and
gradual
decline
of
the
native
population
the
frightful
climatic
changes
which
swept
the
country
like
a
scythe
the
rapid
conversion
of
a
vast
continent
alive
with
millions
of
people
into
a
silent
wilderness
where
the
sun
and
moon
look
down
in
turn
upon
hundreds
of
cities
all
this
is
told
by
with
force
and
accuracy
here
truth
is
a
bitter
pill
but
good
physic
aboard
the
zlōtuhb
in
the
year
there
is
land
ahead
was
first
to
see
it
and
when
he
shouted
the
tidings
my
heart
beat
fast
with
joy
the
famished
crew
have
forgotten
their
disconsolate
stomachs
and
are
dancing
about
the
deck
is
not
i
forsooth
who
shall
restrain
them
a
month
of
emptiness
upon
a
heavy
sea
is
preparation
for
any
folly
nōfūhl
alone
is
without
enthusiasm
the
old
man
heart
seems
dead
we
can
see
the
land
plainly
a
dim
strip
along
the
western
horizon
a
fair
wind
blows
from
the
northeast
but
we
get
on
with
cruel
hindrance
for
the
is
a
heavy
ship
her
bluff
bow
and
voluminous
bottom
ill
fitting
her
for
speed
the
land
as
we
near
it
seems
covered
with
trees
and
the
white
breakers
along
the
yellow
beach
are
a
welcome
sight
sighted
a
fine
harbor
this
afternoon
and
are
now
at
anchor
in
it
thinks
we
have
reached
one
of
the
western
islands
mentioned
by
nōfūhl
however
is
sure
we
are
further
north
what
a
change
has
come
over
nōfūhl
he
is
the
youngest
man
aboard
we
all
share
his
delight
as
our
discoveries
are
truly
marvellous
this
morning
while
i
was
yet
in
my
bunk
he
ran
into
the
cabin
and
forgetting
our
difference
in
rank
seized
me
by
the
arm
and
tried
to
drag
me
out
his
excitement
so
had
the
better
of
him
that
i
captured
little
meaning
from
his
words
hastening
after
him
however
i
was
amazed
to
see
such
ancient
limbs
transport
a
man
so
rapidly
he
skipped
up
the
narrow
stairs
like
a
heifer
and
young
though
i
am
it
was
faster
than
i
could
follow
but
what
a
sight
when
i
reached
the
deck
we
saw
nothing
of
it
yesterday
for
the
dusk
of
evening
was
already
closing
about
us
when
we
anchored
right
ahead
in
the
middle
of
the
bay
towered
a
gigantic
statue
many
times
higher
than
the
masts
of
our
ship
beyond
from
behind
this
statue
came
the
broad
river
upon
whose
waters
we
were
floating
its
surface
all
with
the
rising
sun
to
the
east
where
nōfūhl
was
pointing
his
fingers
trembling
with
excitement
lay
the
ruins
of
an
endless
city
it
stretched
far
away
into
the
land
beyond
further
even
than
our
eyes
could
see
and
in
the
smaller
river
on
the
right
stood
two
colossal
structures
rising
high
in
the
air
and
standing
like
twin
brothers
as
if
to
guard
the
deserted
streets
beneath
not
a
sound
reached
us
not
a
floating
thing
disturbed
the
surface
of
the
water
verily
it
seemed
the
sleep
of
death
i
was
lost
in
wonder
as
we
looked
a
strange
bird
like
a
heron
arose
with
a
hoarse
cry
from
the
foot
of
the
great
image
and
flew
toward
the
city
what
does
it
all
mean
i
cried
where
are
we
where
indeed
said
nōfūhl
if
i
knew
but
that
o
prince
i
could
tell
the
rest
no
traveller
has
mentioned
these
ruins
persian
history
contains
no
record
of
such
a
people
allah
has
decreed
that
we
discover
a
forgotten
world
illustration
the
city
of
ruins
within
an
hour
we
landed
and
found
ourselves
in
an
ancient
street
the
pavements
covered
with
weeds
grass
and
flowers
all
crowding
together
in
wild
neglect
huge
trees
of
great
antiquity
thrust
their
limbs
through
windows
and
roofs
and
produced
a
mournful
sight
they
gave
a
welcome
shade
however
as
we
find
the
heat
ashore
of
a
roasting
quality
most
hard
to
bear
the
curious
buildings
on
either
side
are
wonderfully
preserved
even
sheets
of
glass
still
standing
in
many
of
the
iron
we
wandered
along
through
the
thick
grass
nōfūhl
and
i
much
excited
over
our
discoveries
and
delighted
with
the
strange
scene
the
sunshine
is
of
dazzling
brightness
birds
are
singing
everywhere
and
the
ruins
are
gay
with
gorgeous
wild
flowers
we
soon
found
ourselves
in
what
was
once
a
public
square
now
for
the
most
part
a
shady
grove
afterward
ascertained
to
be
the
square
of
the
city
hall
illustration
we
soon
found
ourselves
in
what
was
once
a
public
square
as
we
sat
on
a
fallen
cornice
and
gazed
on
the
lofty
buildings
about
us
i
asked
nōfūhl
if
he
was
still
in
ignorance
as
to
where
we
were
and
he
said
as
yet
i
know
not
the
architecture
is
much
like
that
of
ancient
europe
but
it
tells
us
nothing
then
i
said
to
him
in
jest
let
this
teach
us
o
nōfūhl
the
folly
of
excessive
wisdom
who
among
thy
pupils
of
the
imperial
college
at
ispahan
would
believe
their
venerable
instructor
in
history
and
languages
could
visit
the
largest
city
in
the
world
and
know
so
little
about
it
thy
words
are
wise
my
prince
he
answered
few
babes
could
know
less
as
we
were
leaving
this
grove
my
eyes
fell
upon
an
upturned
slab
that
seemed
to
have
a
meaning
it
was
lying
at
our
feet
partly
hidden
by
the
tall
grass
having
fallen
from
the
columns
that
supported
it
upon
its
surface
were
strange
characters
in
bold
relief
as
sharp
and
clear
as
when
chiselled
ten
centuries
ago
i
pointed
it
out
to
nōfūhl
and
we
bent
over
it
with
eager
eyes
it
was
this
astor
house
the
inscription
is
old
english
he
said
signified
a
dwelling
but
the
word
i
know
not
it
was
probably
the
name
of
a
deity
and
here
was
his
temple
this
was
encouraging
and
we
looked
about
eagerly
for
other
signs
our
steps
soon
brought
us
into
another
street
and
as
we
walked
i
expressed
my
surprise
at
the
wonderful
preservation
of
the
stone
work
which
looked
as
though
cut
but
yesterday
in
such
an
atmosphere
decay
is
slow
said
nōfūhl
a
thousand
years
at
least
have
passed
since
these
houses
were
occupied
take
yonder
oak
for
instance
the
tree
itself
has
been
growing
for
at
least
a
hundred
years
and
we
know
from
the
fallen
mass
beneath
it
that
centuries
had
gone
by
before
its
birth
was
possible
he
stopped
speaking
his
eyes
fixed
upon
an
inscription
over
a
doorway
partly
hidden
by
one
of
the
branches
of
the
oak
turning
suddenly
upon
me
with
a
look
of
triumph
he
exclaimed
it
is
ours
what
is
ours
i
asked
the
knowledge
we
sought
and
he
pointed
to
the
inscription
new
york
stock
exc
he
was
tremulous
with
joy
illustration
knowledge
we
sought
and
he
pointed
to
the
inscription
thou
hast
heard
of
o
my
prince
i
answered
that
i
had
read
of
it
at
school
thou
art
in
it
now
he
said
we
are
standing
on
the
western
continent
little
wonder
we
thought
our
voyage
long
and
what
was
i
asked
i
read
of
it
at
college
but
remember
little
was
it
not
the
capital
of
the
ancient
mehrikans
not
the
capital
he
answered
but
their
largest
city
its
population
was
four
millions
four
millions
i
exclaimed
verily
o
fountain
of
wisdom
that
is
many
for
one
city
such
is
history
my
prince
moreover
as
thou
knowest
it
would
take
us
many
days
to
walk
this
town
true
it
is
endless
he
continued
thus
strange
that
a
single
word
can
tell
so
much
those
iron
structures
the
huge
statue
in
the
harbor
the
temples
with
pointed
towers
all
are
as
writ
in
history
whereupon
i
repeated
that
i
knew
little
of
the
mehrikans
save
what
i
had
learned
at
college
a
perfunctory
and
fleeting
knowledge
as
they
were
a
people
who
interested
me
but
little
let
us
seat
ourselves
in
the
shade
said
nōfūhl
and
i
will
tell
thee
of
them
illustration
in
a
street
of
the
forgotten
city
we
sat
for
eleven
centuries
the
cities
of
this
sleeping
hemisphere
have
decayed
in
solitude
their
very
existence
has
been
forgotten
the
people
who
built
them
have
long
since
passed
away
and
their
civilization
is
but
a
shadowy
tradition
historians
are
astounded
that
a
nation
of
an
hundred
million
beings
should
vanish
from
the
earth
like
a
mist
and
leave
so
little
behind
but
to
those
familiar
with
their
lives
and
character
surprise
is
impossible
there
was
nothing
to
leave
the
mehrikans
possessed
neither
literature
art
nor
music
of
their
own
everything
was
borrowed
the
very
clothes
they
wore
were
copied
with
ludicrous
precision
from
the
models
of
other
nations
they
were
a
sharp
restless
greedy
race
given
body
and
soul
to
the
gathering
of
riches
their
chiefest
passion
was
to
buy
and
sell
even
women
both
of
high
and
low
degree
spent
much
of
their
time
at
bargains
crowding
and
jostling
each
other
in
vast
marts
of
trade
for
their
attire
was
complicated
and
demanded
most
of
their
time
how
degrading
i
exclaimed
so
it
must
have
been
said
nōfūhl
but
they
were
not
without
virtues
their
domestic
life
was
happy
a
man
had
but
one
wife
and
treated
her
as
his
equal
that
is
curious
but
as
i
remember
they
were
a
people
of
elastic
honor
they
were
so
considered
said
nōfūhl
their
commercial
honor
was
a
jest
they
were
sharper
than
the
turks
prosperity
was
their
god
with
cunning
and
invention
for
his
prophets
their
restless
activity
no
persian
can
comprehend
this
vast
country
was
alive
with
noisy
industries
the
nervous
mehrikans
darting
with
inconceivable
rapidity
from
one
city
to
another
by
a
system
of
locomotion
we
can
only
guess
at
there
existed
roads
with
iron
rods
upon
them
over
which
small
houses
on
wheels
were
drawn
with
such
velocity
that
a
long
journey
was
accomplished
in
an
hour
enormous
ships
without
sails
driven
by
a
mysterious
force
bore
hundreds
of
people
at
a
time
to
the
furthermost
points
of
the
earth
and
are
these
things
lost
i
asked
we
know
many
of
the
forces
said
nōfūhl
but
the
knowledge
of
applying
them
is
gone
the
very
elements
seem
to
have
been
their
slaves
cities
were
illuminated
at
night
by
artificial
moons
whose
radiance
eclipsed
the
moon
above
strange
devices
were
in
use
by
which
they
conversed
together
when
separated
by
a
journey
of
many
days
some
of
these
appliances
exist
in
persian
museums
the
superstitions
of
our
ancestors
allowed
their
secrets
to
be
lost
during
those
dark
centuries
from
which
at
last
we
are
waking
at
this
point
we
heard
the
voice
of
in
the
distance
they
had
found
a
spring
and
he
was
calling
to
us
such
heat
we
had
never
felt
and
it
grew
hotter
each
hour
near
the
river
where
we
ate
it
was
more
comfortable
but
even
there
the
perspiration
stood
upon
us
in
great
drops
our
faces
shone
like
fishes
it
was
our
wish
to
explore
further
but
the
streets
were
like
ovens
and
we
returned
to
the
as
i
sat
upon
the
deck
this
afternoon
recording
the
events
of
the
morning
in
this
journal
and
approached
asking
permission
to
take
the
small
boat
and
visit
the
great
statue
thereupon
nōfūhl
informed
us
that
this
statue
in
ancient
times
held
aloft
a
torch
illuminating
the
whole
harbor
and
he
requested
to
try
and
discover
how
the
light
was
accomplished
they
returned
toward
evening
with
this
information
that
the
statue
is
not
of
solid
bronze
but
hollow
that
they
ascended
by
means
of
an
iron
stairway
into
the
head
of
the
image
and
from
the
top
looked
down
upon
us
that
in
the
dark
sat
to
rest
himself
upon
a
nest
of
yellow
flies
with
black
stripes
that
these
flies
inserted
stings
into
person
causing
him
to
exclaim
loudly
and
descend
the
stairs
with
unexpected
agility
that
and
the
others
pushed
on
through
the
upraised
arm
and
stood
at
last
upon
the
bronze
torch
itself
that
the
city
lay
beneath
them
like
a
map
covering
the
country
for
miles
away
on
both
sides
of
the
river
as
for
illuminating
the
harbor
says
nōfūhl
is
mistaken
there
are
no
vestiges
of
anything
that
could
give
a
light
no
vessel
for
oil
or
traces
of
fire
nōfūhl
says
is
an
idiot
that
he
shall
go
himself
illustration
the
great
statue
in
the
harbor
a
startling
discovery
this
morning
by
landing
higher
up
the
river
we
explored
a
part
of
the
city
where
the
buildings
are
of
a
different
character
from
those
we
saw
yesterday
nōfūhl
considers
them
the
dwellings
of
the
rich
in
shape
they
are
like
bricks
set
on
end
all
very
similar
uninteresting
and
monotonous
we
noticed
one
where
the
doors
and
shutters
were
still
in
place
but
rotting
from
the
fantastic
hinges
that
supported
them
a
few
hard
blows
brought
down
the
outer
doors
in
a
dusty
heap
and
as
we
stepped
upon
the
marble
floor
within
our
eyes
met
an
unexpected
sight
furniture
statues
dingy
pictures
in
crumbling
frames
images
in
bronze
and
silver
mirrors
curtains
all
were
there
but
in
every
condition
of
decay
we
knocked
open
the
iron
shutters
and
let
the
light
into
the
rooms
sealed
up
for
centuries
in
the
first
one
lay
a
rug
from
persia
faded
gone
in
places
it
seemed
to
ask
us
with
dying
eyes
to
be
taken
hence
my
heart
grew
soft
over
the
ancient
rug
and
i
caught
a
foolish
look
in
eye
as
we
climbed
the
mouldering
stair
to
the
floor
above
i
expressed
surprise
that
cloth
and
woodwork
should
hold
together
for
so
many
centuries
also
saying
these
mehrikans
were
not
so
unworthy
as
we
think
them
that
may
be
said
but
the
persian
rug
is
far
the
freshest
object
we
have
seen
and
that
perchance
was
ancient
when
they
bought
it
on
this
floor
we
entered
a
dim
chamber
spacious
and
once
richly
furnished
when
pushed
open
the
shutters
and
drew
aside
the
ragged
curtains
we
started
at
the
sight
before
us
upon
a
wide
bed
in
the
centre
of
the
room
lay
a
human
form
the
long
yellow
hair
still
clinging
to
the
head
it
was
more
a
mummy
than
a
skeleton
around
upon
the
bed
lay
mouldering
fragments
of
the
once
white
sheets
that
covered
it
on
the
fingers
of
the
left
hand
glistened
two
rings
which
drew
our
attention
one
held
a
diamond
of
great
price
the
other
was
composed
of
sapphires
and
diamonds
most
curiously
arranged
we
stood
a
moment
in
silence
gazing
sadly
upon
the
figure
poor
woman
i
said
left
thus
to
die
alone
it
is
more
probable
said
nōfūhl
she
was
already
dead
and
her
friends
departing
perhaps
in
haste
were
unable
to
burn
the
body
did
they
burn
their
dead
i
asked
in
my
history
was
writ
they
buried
them
in
the
earth
like
potatoes
and
left
them
to
rot
and
nōfūhl
answered
at
one
time
it
was
so
but
later
on
as
they
became
more
civilized
the
custom
was
abandoned
is
it
possible
i
asked
that
this
woman
has
been
lying
here
almost
a
thousand
years
and
yet
so
well
preserved
i
also
am
surprised
said
nōfūhl
i
can
only
account
for
it
by
the
extreme
dryness
of
the
air
in
absorbing
the
juices
of
the
body
and
retarding
decay
illustration
in
the
mouldering
chamber
then
lifting
tenderly
in
his
hand
some
of
the
yellow
hair
he
said
she
was
probably
very
young
scarce
twenty
were
their
women
fair
i
asked
they
were
beautiful
he
answered
with
graceful
forms
and
lovely
faces
a
pleasure
to
the
eye
also
were
they
gay
and
sprightly
with
much
animation
thereupon
cried
here
are
the
first
words
thou
hast
uttered
o
nōfūhl
that
cause
me
to
regret
the
extinction
of
this
people
there
is
ever
a
place
in
my
heart
for
a
blushing
maiden
then
let
thy
grief
be
of
short
life
responded
nōfūhl
for
mehrikan
damsels
were
not
of
that
description
blushing
was
an
art
they
practised
little
the
shyness
thou
so
lovest
in
a
persian
maiden
was
to
them
an
unknown
thing
our
shrinking
daughters
bear
no
resemblance
to
these
western
products
they
strode
the
public
streets
with
roving
eyes
and
unblushing
faces
holding
free
converse
with
men
as
with
women
bold
of
speech
and
free
of
manner
going
and
coming
as
it
pleased
them
best
they
knew
much
of
the
world
managed
their
own
affairs
and
devised
their
own
marriages
often
changing
their
minds
and
marrying
another
than
the
betrothed
bismillah
and
men
could
love
these
things
exclaimed
with
much
feeling
so
it
appears
but
i
should
say
the
mehrikan
bride
had
much
the
freshness
of
a
dried
fig
so
she
had
said
nōfūhl
but
those
who
know
only
the
dried
fig
have
no
regret
for
the
fresh
fruit
but
the
fault
was
not
with
the
maidens
brought
up
like
boys
with
the
same
studies
and
mental
development
the
womanly
part
of
their
nature
gradually
vanished
as
their
minds
expanded
vigor
of
intellect
was
the
object
of
a
woman
education
then
exclaimed
with
great
disgust
praises
be
to
allah
for
his
aid
in
exterminating
such
a
people
and
he
walked
away
from
the
bed
and
began
looking
about
the
chamber
in
a
moment
he
hastened
back
to
us
saying
here
are
more
jewels
also
money
nōfūhl
eagerly
took
the
pieces
money
he
cried
money
will
tell
us
more
than
pages
of
history
there
were
silver
coins
of
different
sizes
and
two
small
pieces
of
copper
nōfūhl
studied
them
closely
the
latest
date
is
he
said
a
little
less
than
a
thousand
years
ago
but
the
piece
may
have
been
in
circulation
some
years
before
this
woman
died
also
it
may
have
been
coined
the
very
year
of
her
death
it
bears
the
head
of
dennis
the
last
of
the
dictators
the
race
is
supposed
to
have
become
extinct
before
of
their
era
illustration
the
face
and
back
of
one
of
the
silver
coins
i
then
said
thou
hast
never
told
us
o
nōfūhl
the
cause
of
their
disappearance
there
were
many
causes
he
answered
the
mehrikans
themselves
were
of
english
origin
but
people
from
all
parts
of
europe
came
here
in
vast
numbers
although
the
original
comers
were
vigorous
and
hardy
the
effect
of
climate
upon
succeeding
generations
was
fatal
they
became
and
thin
with
scanty
hair
fragile
teeth
and
weak
digestions
nervous
diseases
unknown
to
us
wrought
deadly
havoc
children
were
reared
with
difficulty
between
and
the
last
census
of
which
any
record
remains
the
population
decreased
from
ninety
millions
to
less
than
twelve
millions
climatic
changes
the
like
of
which
no
other
land
ever
experienced
began
at
that
period
and
finished
in
less
than
ten
years
a
work
made
easy
by
nervous
natures
and
rapid
lives
the
temperature
would
skip
in
a
single
day
from
burning
heat
to
winter
cold
no
constitution
could
withstand
it
and
this
vast
continent
became
once
more
an
empty
wilderness
much
more
of
the
same
nature
he
told
us
but
i
am
too
sleepy
to
write
longer
we
explored
the
rest
of
the
mansion
finding
many
things
of
interest
i
caused
several
objects
to
be
carried
aboard
the
these
objects
are
now
in
the
museum
of
the
imperial
college
at
teheran
hotter
than
yesterday
in
the
afternoon
we
were
rowed
up
the
river
and
landed
for
a
short
walk
it
is
unsafe
to
brave
the
sun
the
more
i
learn
of
these
mehrikans
the
less
interesting
they
become
nōfūhl
is
of
much
the
same
mind
judging
from
our
conversation
as
we
walked
along
together
it
was
in
this
wise
how
alike
the
houses
how
monotonous
so
also
were
the
occupants
they
thought
alike
worked
alike
ate
dressed
and
conversed
alike
they
read
the
same
books
they
fashioned
their
garments
as
directed
with
no
regard
for
the
size
or
figure
of
the
individual
and
copied
to
a
stitch
the
fashions
of
europeans
but
the
apparel
of
the
european
must
have
been
sadly
uncomfortable
in
the
heat
of
a
mehrikan
summer
so
probably
it
was
stiff
boxes
of
varying
patterns
adorned
the
heads
of
men
curious
jackets
with
tight
sleeves
compressed
the
body
the
feet
throbbed
and
burned
in
casings
of
unyielding
leather
and
linen
made
stiff
by
artificial
means
was
drawn
tightly
about
the
neck
allah
what
idiots
even
so
are
they
considered
to
what
quality
of
their
minds
do
you
attribute
such
love
of
needless
suffering
it
was
their
desire
to
be
like
others
a
natural
feeling
in
a
vulgar
people
a
fair
wind
from
the
west
we
weighed
anchor
and
sailed
up
the
eastern
side
of
the
city
i
did
this
as
nōfūhl
finds
the
upper
portion
of
the
town
much
richer
in
relics
than
the
lower
which
seems
to
have
been
given
up
to
commercial
purposes
we
sailed
close
under
one
of
the
great
monuments
in
the
river
and
are
at
a
loss
to
divine
its
meaning
many
iron
rods
still
dangle
from
the
tops
of
each
of
the
structures
as
they
are
in
a
line
one
with
the
other
we
thought
at
first
they
might
have
been
once
connected
and
served
as
a
bridge
but
we
soon
saw
they
were
too
far
apart
came
to
anchor
about
three
miles
from
the
old
mooring
up
the
river
and
down
north
south
east
and
west
the
ruins
stretch
away
indefinitely
seemingly
without
end
am
anxious
about
he
went
ashore
and
has
not
returned
it
is
now
after
midnight
illustration

river
praise
allah
my
dear
comrade
is
alive
this
morning
we
landed
early
and
began
our
search
for
him
as
we
passed
before
the
building
which
bears
the
inscription
dorf
astoria
upon
its
front
we
heard
his
voice
from
within
in
answer
to
our
calls
we
entered
and
after
climbing
the
ruined
stairway
found
him
seated
upon
the
floor
above
he
had
a
swollen
leg
from
an
ugly
sprain
and
various
bruises
were
also
his
while
our
friends
were
constructing
a
litter
on
which
to
bear
him
hence
we
conversed
together
the
walls
about
us
bore
traces
of
having
once
enclosed
a
hall
of
some
beauty
in
idling
about
i
pulled
open
the
decaying
door
of
an
old
closet
and
saw
upon
the
rotting
shelves
many
pieces
of
glass
and
earthenware
of
fine
workmanship
taking
one
in
my
hand
a
small
of
glass
i
approached
my
comrade
calling
his
attention
to
its
slender
stem
and
curious
form
as
his
eyes
fell
upon
it
they
opened
wide
in
amazement
i
also
observed
a
trembling
of
his
hand
as
he
reached
forth
to
touch
it
he
then
recounted
to
me
his
marvellous
adventure
of
the
night
before
but
saying
before
he
began
thou
knowest
o
prince
i
am
no
believer
in
visions
and
i
should
never
tell
the
tale
but
for
thy
discovery
of
this
cup
i
drank
from
such
an
one
last
night
proffered
by
a
ghostly
hand
i
would
have
smiled
but
he
was
much
in
earnest
as
i
made
a
movement
to
sit
beside
him
he
said
taste
first
o
my
master
of
the
grapes
hanging
from
yonder
wall
i
did
so
and
to
my
great
surprise
found
them
of
an
exquisite
flavor
finer
even
than
the
cultivated
fruit
of
persia
sweeter
and
more
delicate
of
a
different
nature
from
the
wild
grapes
we
have
been
eating
my
astonishment
appeared
to
delight
him
and
he
said
with
a
laugh
the
grapes
are
impossible
but
they
exist
even
more
absurd
is
my
story
and
he
then
narrated
his
adventure
it
was
this
what
saw
yesterday
after
nightfall
as
he
was
hastening
toward
the
he
fell
violently
upon
some
blocks
of
stone
wrenching
his
ankle
and
much
bruising
himself
unable
to
walk
upon
his
foot
he
limped
into
this
building
to
await
our
coming
in
the
morning
the
howling
of
wolves
and
other
wild
beasts
as
they
prowled
about
the
city
drove
him
for
safety
to
crawl
up
the
ruins
of
the
stairway
to
the
floor
above
as
he
settled
himself
in
a
corner
of
this
hall
his
nostrils
were
greeted
with
the
delicious
odor
from
the
grapes
about
his
head
he
found
them
surprisingly
good
and
ate
heartily
he
soon
after
fell
into
a
sleep
which
lasted
some
hours
for
when
he
awoke
the
moon
was
higher
in
the
heavens
the
voices
of
the
wolves
were
hushed
and
the
city
was
silent
as
he
lay
in
a
revery
much
absorbed
in
his
own
thoughts
he
gradually
became
aware
of
mysterious
changes
taking
place
as
if
by
stealth
about
him
a
decorated
ceiling
appeared
to
be
closing
over
the
hall
mirrors
and
tinted
walls
slowly
crept
in
place
of
ivy
and
crumbling
bricks
a
faint
glow
grew
stronger
and
more
intense
until
it
filled
the
great
room
with
a
dazzling
light
then
came
softly
into
view
a
table
of
curious
form
set
out
with
flowers
and
innumerable
dishes
of
glass
and
porcelain
as
for
a
feast
standing
about
the
room
he
saw
solemn
men
with
beardless
faces
all
in
black
attire
whose
garments
bore
triangular
openings
upon
the
chest
to
show
the
shirt
beneath
these
personages
he
soon
discovered
were
servants
as
he
gazed
in
bewilderment
there
entered
other
figures
two
by
two
who
took
their
seats
about
the
table
these
later
comers
sixty
or
more
were
men
and
women
walking
arm
in
arm
the
women
in
rich
attire
of
unfamiliar
fashion
and
sparkling
with
precious
stones
the
men
were
clad
like
the
servants
they
ate
and
drank
and
laughed
and
formed
a
brilliant
scene
rose
to
his
feet
and
moved
by
a
curiosity
he
made
no
effort
to
resist
for
he
is
a
reckless
fellow
and
knows
no
fear
he
hobbled
out
into
the
room
they
looked
upon
him
in
surprise
and
seemed
much
amused
at
his
presence
one
of
the
guests
a
tall
youth
with
yellow
mustaches
approached
him
offering
a
delicate
crystal
vessel
filled
with
a
sparkling
fluid
took
it
the
youth
raised
another
from
the
table
and
with
a
slight
gesture
as
if
in
salutation
he
said
in
words
which
my
comrade
understood
though
he
swears
it
was
a
language
unknown
to
him
we
may
meet
again
the
fourth
of
next
month
he
then
drank
the
wine
and
so
did
hereupon
the
others
smiled
as
if
at
their
comrade
wit
all
save
the
women
whose
tender
faces
spoke
more
of
pity
than
of
mirth
the
wine
flew
to
his
brain
as
he
drank
it
and
things
about
him
seemed
to
reel
and
spin
strains
of
fantastic
music
burst
upon
his
ears
then
all
in
rhythm
the
women
joined
their
partners
and
whirled
about
him
with
a
lightsome
step
and
moving
with
it
his
throbbing
brain
seemed
dancing
from
his
head
the
room
itself
all
swaying
and
quivering
with
the
melody
grew
dim
and
stole
from
view
the
music
softly
died
away
again
was
silence
the
moon
above
looking
calmly
down
upon
the
ivied
walls
he
fell
like
a
drunken
man
upon
the
floor
and
did
not
wake
till
our
voices
called
him
such
his
tale
he
has
a
clear
head
and
is
no
liar
but
so
many
grapes
upon
an
empty
stomach
with
the
fever
from
his
swollen
limb
might
well
explain
it
bear
meat
for
dinner
this
morning
toward
noon
kuzundam
the
second
officer
wandered
on
ahead
of
us
and
entered
a
large
building
in
pursuit
of
a
rabbit
he
was
about
descending
to
the
basement
below
when
he
saw
close
before
him
a
bear
leisurely
mounting
the
marble
stairs
kuzundam
is
no
coward
but
he
turned
and
ran
as
he
never
ran
before
the
bear
who
seemed
of
a
sportive
nature
also
ran
and
in
close
pursuit
luckily
for
my
friend
we
happened
to
be
near
otherwise
instead
of
our
eating
bear
meat
the
bear
might
have
lunched
quietly
off
kuzundam
in
the
shady
corridors
of
the
fifthavenuehotel
illustration
kuzundam
narrow
escape
a
scorching
heat
that
burns
the
lungs
we
started
in
the
morning
prepared
to
spend
the
night
ashore
and
explore
the
northern
end
of
the
city
it
was
a
pleasant
walk
through
the
soft
grass
of
the
shady
streets
but
in
those
places
unsheltered
from
the
sun
we
were
as
fish
upon
a
other
dwellings
we
saw
even
larger
and
more
imposing
than
the
one
we
entered
yesterday
we
were
tempted
to
explore
them
but
wisely
dissuaded
us
saying
the
day
was
waxing
hotter
each
hour
and
it
could
be
done
on
our
return
in
the
northern
part
of
the
town
are
many
religious
temples
with
their
tall
towers
like
slender
pyramids
tapering
to
a
point
they
are
curious
things
and
surprisingly
well
preserved
the
interiors
of
these
temples
are
uninteresting
nōfūhl
says
the
religious
rites
of
the
mehrikans
were
devoid
of
character
there
were
many
religious
beliefs
all
complicated
and
insignificant
variations
one
from
another
each
sect
having
its
own
temples
and
refusing
to
believe
as
the
others
this
is
amusing
to
a
persian
but
mayhap
was
a
serious
matter
with
them
one
day
in
each
week
they
assembled
the
priests
reading
long
moral
lectures
written
by
themselves
with
music
by
hired
singers
they
then
separated
taking
no
thought
of
temple
or
priest
for
another
seven
days
nōfūhl
says
they
were
not
a
religious
people
that
the
temples
were
filled
mostly
with
women
illustration
in
one
of
the
temples
in
the
afternoon
we
found
it
necessary
to
traverse
a
vast
now
a
wild
forest
but
with
traces
still
visible
of
broad
promenades
and
winding
driveways
olbaldeh
thinks
this
must
be
the
centralpahk
sometimes
alluded
to
in
mehrikan
literature
there
remains
an
avenue
of
bronze
statues
most
of
them
yet
upright
and
in
good
condition
but
very
comic
and
i
still
think
them
caricatures
but
nōfūhl
is
positive
they
were
serious
efforts
and
says
the
mehrikans
were
easily
pleased
in
matters
of
art
we
lost
our
way
in
this
park
having
nothing
to
guide
us
as
in
the
streets
of
the
city
this
was
most
happy
as
otherwise
we
should
have
missed
a
surprising
discovery
it
occurred
in
this
wise
being
somewhat
overcome
by
the
heat
we
halted
upon
a
little
hill
to
rest
ourselves
while
reclining
beneath
the
trees
i
noticed
unusual
carvings
upon
a
huge
block
against
which
was
supporting
his
back
they
were
unlike
any
we
had
seen
and
yet
they
were
not
unfamiliar
as
i
lay
there
gazing
idly
at
them
it
flashed
upon
me
they
were
egyptian
we
at
once
fell
to
examining
the
block
and
found
to
our
amazement
an
obelisk
of
egyptian
granite
covered
with
egyptian
hieroglyphics
of
an
antiquity
exceeding
by
thousands
of
years
the
most
ancient
monuments
of
the
country
verily
we
were
puzzled
when
did
the
egyptians
invade
mehrika
quoth
with
a
solemn
look
as
if
trying
to
recall
a
date
no
egyptian
ever
heard
of
mehrika
said
nōfūhl
this
obelisk
was
finished
twenty
centuries
before
the
first
mehrikan
was
weaned
in
all
probability
it
was
brought
here
as
a
curiosity
just
as
we
take
to
persia
the
bronze
head
of
we
spent
much
time
over
the
monument
and
i
think
nōfūhl
was
disappointed
that
he
could
not
bring
it
away
with
him
also
while
in
this
park
we
came
to
a
high
tower
standing
by
itself
and
climbed
to
the
top
where
we
enjoyed
a
view
the
extent
of
the
city
is
astounding
miles
away
in
the
river
lay
the
a
white
speck
on
the
water
all
about
us
in
every
direction
as
far
as
sight
can
reach
were
ruins
and
ruins
and
ruins
never
was
a
more
melancholy
sight
the
blue
sky
the
bright
sunshine
the
air
with
the
gay
flowers
and
singing
birds
only
made
it
sadder
they
seemed
a
mockery
illustration
miles
away
in
the
river
lay
the
a
white
speck
on
the
water
we
have
encamped
for
the
night
and
i
can
write
no
more
countless
flying
insects
gather
about
us
with
a
hateful
buzz
and
bite
us
beyond
endurance
they
are
a
pest
thrice
accursed
i
tell
nōfūhl
his
fine
theory
concerning
the
extinction
of
the
yahnkis
is
a
good
tale
for
those
who
have
never
been
here
no
man
without
a
leather
skin
could
survive
a
second
night
poor
is
worse
than
sick
he
had
an
encounter
last
night
with
a
strange
animal
and
his
defeat
was
ignoble
the
animal
a
pretty
thing
much
like
a
kitten
was
hovering
near
when
with
rare
courage
and
agility
threw
himself
upon
it
and
then
what
happened
none
of
us
can
state
with
precision
we
know
we
held
our
noses
and
fled
and
no
words
can
fit
him
he
carries
with
him
an
odor
to
devastate
a
province
we
had
to
leave
him
ashore
and
send
him
fresh
raiment
this
is
verily
a
land
of
surprises
our
hands
and
faces
still
smart
from
the
biting
insects
and
the
perfume
of
the
odorous
kitten
promises
to
be
ever
with
us
nōfūhl
is
happy
we
have
discovered
hundreds
of
metal
blocks
the
poorest
of
which
he
asserts
would
be
the
gem
of
a
museum
they
were
found
by
in
the
basement
of
a
high
building
all
laid
carefully
away
upon
iron
shelves
the
flood
of
light
they
throw
upon
the
manners
and
customs
of
this
ludicrous
people
renders
them
of
priceless
value
to
historians
i
harbor
a
suspicion
that
it
causes
nōfūhl
some
pleasure
to
sit
upon
the
cool
deck
of
the
and
watch
walking
to
and
fro
upon
the
ruins
of
a
distant
wharf
the
air
is
cooler
thinks
a
storm
is
brewing
even
nōfūhl
is
puzzled
over
the
wooden
image
we
brought
aboard
yesterday
it
is
well
preserved
with
the
barbaric
coloring
still
fresh
upon
it
they
found
it
standing
upright
in
a
little
shop
illustration
the
wooden
god
how
these
idols
were
worshipped
and
why
they
are
found
in
little
shops
and
never
in
the
great
temples
is
a
mystery
it
has
a
diadem
of
feathers
on
the
head
and
as
we
sat
smoking
upon
the
deck
this
evening
i
remarked
to
nōfūhl
that
it
might
be
the
portrait
of
some
mehrikan
noble
whereupon
he
said
they
had
no
nobles
but
the
mehrikans
of
gentle
blood
i
asked
had
they
no
titles
neither
titles
nor
gentle
blood
he
answered
and
as
they
were
all
of
much
the
same
origin
and
came
to
this
country
simply
to
thrive
more
fatly
than
at
home
there
was
nothing
except
difference
in
wealth
on
which
to
establish
a
superior
order
being
deep
respecters
of
money
this
was
a
satisfying
distinction
it
soon
resulted
that
those
families
who
possessed
riches
for
a
generation
or
two
became
the
substitute
for
an
aristocracy
this
upper
class
was
given
to
sports
and
pastimes
spending
their
wealth
freely
being
prodigiously
fond
of
display
their
intellectual
development
was
feeble
and
they
wielded
but
little
influence
save
in
social
matters
they
followed
closely
the
fashions
of
foreign
aristocracies
great
attentions
were
paid
to
wandering
nobles
from
other
lands
even
distant
relatives
of
titled
people
were
greeted
with
the
warmest
enthusiasm
then
i
said
to
him
but
explain
to
me
o
nōfūhl
how
it
was
possible
for
so
shallow
a
nation
to
become
so
great
they
were
great
only
in
numbers
and
too
weak
to
endure
success
at
the
beginning
of
the
twentieth
century
as
they
counted
time
huge
fortunes
were
amassed
in
a
day
and
the
mehrikans
became
drunk
with
money
whereupon
i
exclaimed
o
land
of
delight
for
much
money
is
cheering
but
the
old
man
shook
his
head
very
true
o
prince
but
the
effect
was
woful
these
vast
fortunes
soon
dominated
all
things
even
the
seat
of
government
and
the
courts
of
justice
tricks
of
finance
brought
fabulous
gains
young
men
became
demoralized
for
sober
industry
with
its
moderate
profits
was
ridiculed
verily
that
would
be
natural
i
said
but
in
a
land
where
all
were
rich
who
was
found
to
cook
and
scrub
to
fetch
and
carry
and
to
till
the
soil
for
none
will
shovel
earth
when
his
pockets
are
stuffed
with
gold
all
were
not
rich
and
when
the
poor
also
became
greedy
they
became
hostile
then
began
social
upheavals
with
bloodshed
and
havoc
illustration
a
street
scene
in
ancient
the
costumes
and
manner
of
riding
are
taken
from
metal
plates
now
in
the
museum
at
teheran
an
icy
wind
from
the
northeast
with
a
violent
rain
yesterday
we
gasped
with
the
hot
air
we
are
shivering
in
winter
clothing
the
same
as
yesterday
most
of
us
are
my
teeth
chatter
and
my
body
is
both
hot
and
cold
a
storm
more
wicked
never
wailed
about
a
ship
calls
it
the
shrieking
voices
of
the
hundred
millions
of
mehrikans
who
must
have
perished
in
similar
weather
it
is
many
days
since
i
have
touched
this
journal
a
hateful
sickness
has
been
upon
me
destroying
all
energy
and
courage
a
sort
of
fever
and
yet
my
limbs
were
cold
i
could
not
describe
it
if
i
would
nōfūhl
came
into
the
cabin
this
evening
with
some
of
his
metal
plates
and
discoursed
upon
them
he
has
no
respect
for
the
intellects
of
the
early
mehrikans
i
thought
for
a
moment
i
had
caught
him
in
a
contradiction
but
he
was
right
as
usual
it
was
thus
they
were
great
readers
you
have
told
us
they
had
no
literature
were
they
great
readers
of
nothing
verily
thou
hast
said
it
vast
sheets
of
paper
were
published
daily
in
which
all
crimes
were
recorded
in
detail
the
more
revolting
the
deed
the
more
minute
the
description
horrors
were
their
chief
delight
scandals
were
drunk
in
with
thirstful
eyes
these
chronicles
of
crime
and
filth
were
issued
by
hundreds
of
thousands
there
was
hardly
a
family
in
the
land
but
had
one
and
did
this
take
the
place
of
literature
even
so
once
more
we
are
on
the
sea
two
days
from
our
decision
was
a
sudden
one
nōfūhl
in
an
evil
moment
found
among
those
accursed
plates
a
map
of
the
country
and
thereupon
was
seized
with
an
unreasoning
desire
to
visit
a
town
called
washington
i
wavered
and
at
last
consented
foolishly
i
believe
for
the
crew
are
loud
for
persia
and
this
town
is
inland
on
a
river
he
says
it
was
their
finest
city
the
seat
of
government
the
capital
of
the
country
swears
he
can
find
it
if
the
map
is
truthful
still
eats
by
himself
this
afternoon
we
reclined
upon
the
deck
the
drifting
gently
in
a
southerly
direction
land
could
be
seen
on
the
starboard
bow
a
faint
strip
along
the
western
horizon
it
was
about
the
middle
of
the
afternoon
while
passing
the
ruins
of
a
gigantic
tower
perhaps
a
lighthouse
that
nōfūhl
of
a
sudden
clambered
hastily
to
his
feet
and
looked
about
him
then
he
called
to
asking
how
many
leagues
we
were
from
the
harbor
of
reply
i
forget
but
it
filled
the
old
man
with
a
gentle
excitement
i
observed
an
unwonted
sparkle
in
his
eyes
also
a
quivering
of
the
fingers
as
he
pointed
to
the
ocean
around
about
and
exclaimed
beneath
us
the
bottom
of
the
sea
is
covered
with
iron
ships
the
wrecks
of
stupendous
navies
the
mightiest
of
all
human
history
at
once
we
all
became
interested
what
navies
i
inquired
and
what
compassed
their
destruction
was
it
a
battle
a
battle
of
whose
magnitude
no
persian
has
conception
a
conflict
in
which
the
sea
was
tossed
and
the
heavens
rent
by
thunderings
of
iron
monsters
any
one
of
them
would
have
blown
to
atoms
a
fleet
of
verily
a
tale
easier
told
than
believed
but
i
would
readily
venture
my
head
in
the
against
any
of
these
wonders
and
with
wisdom
for
the
loss
of
thy
brain
could
not
affect
the
nature
of
thy
speech
whereupon
there
was
laughter
and
held
his
peace
but
tell
us
of
this
battle
o
nōfūhl
i
remember
now
to
have
read
about
it
at
college
these
details
of
ancient
history
i
am
prone
to
forget
how
came
it
about
i
have
spoken
of
the
mehrikans
being
a
greedy
race
and
their
greed
at
last
resulted
in
this
war
by
means
of
laws
of
their
own
making
they
secured
for
themselves
a
lion
share
of
all
profits
from
the
world
commerce
this
checked
the
prosperity
of
other
nations
until
at
last
the
leading
powers
of
europe
combined
in
against
this
greed
they
collected
an
armada
the
like
of
which
was
never
imagined
neither
before
nor
since
then
across
the
ocean
came
the
iron
host
and
here
upon
this
very
spot
where
we
are
floating
they
met
the
mehrikan
ships
how
many
ships
in
all
the
mehrikans
had
eighty
heavy
ships
of
iron
with
a
number
of
smaller
craft
the
allies
had
two
hundred
and
forty
heavy
battleships
all
of
iron
they
also
had
smaller
craft
for
divers
purposes
allah
a
bad
prospect
for
our
greedy
friends
and
being
a
nation
of
traders
they
had
no
liking
probably
for
the
perils
of
war
as
to
that
historians
differ
according
to
the
mehrikans
themselves
they
were
mighty
warriors
but
certain
writers
of
that
period
give
a
different
impression
is
sure
they
were
cowards
weak
in
body
as
in
spirit
but
often
favored
by
fortune
in
my
opinion
this
battle
throws
considerable
light
upon
that
matter
a
day
like
this
it
was
also
in
june
as
the
europeans
coming
northward
along
the
coast
to
seize
met
the
mehrikan
admiral
with
his
eighty
ships
and
the
struggle
was
short
verily
i
can
believe
it
with
three
ships
to
one
i
would
give
the
europeans
about
half
a
day
a
summer
afternoon
like
this
to
send
the
greedy
ones
to
the
bottom
thy
guess
is
good
o
prince
as
to
the
hours
of
fighting
it
lasted
just
one
summer
afternoon
but
the
mehrikans
it
was
who
sent
their
enemies
to
the
bottom
and
the
sea
beneath
our
feet
is
strewn
with
iron
hulks
bismillah
if
that
be
a
true
tale
and
i
doubt
it
not
these
greedy
ones
were
not
so
contemptible
at
least
when
there
was
profit
in
it
at
what
period
did
this
occur
early
in
the
twentieth
century
i
can
not
recall
the
date
but
it
was
never
forgotten
by
the
mehrikans
surely
a
just
pride
for
on
that
day
they
accomplished
wonders
the
admiral
on
his
ship
the
was
at
one
time
surrounded
by
a
dozen
german
and
lo
he
demolished
all
and
of
frank
and
russyan
vessels
he
put
an
end
to
as
many
more
also
sundry
talyans
and
british
bismillah
but
that
was
good
what
o
nōfūhl
is
the
persian
of
that
name
none
can
tell
with
certainty
to
the
mehrikans
it
signified
victory
or
something
similar
other
miracles
were
achieved
by
the
mehrikans
that
day
a
little
craft
with
a
pointed
prow
jammed
holes
in
nearly
a
score
of
monster
ships
and
the
waters
closed
over
them
there
figured
also
a
long
and
narrow
boat
of
mehrikan
devising
the
this
astonishing
machine
sailed
to
and
fro
among
the
foreign
ships
upsetting
all
traditions
much
glory
befell
her
commander
the
captain
and
how
many
ships
did
the
mehrikans
lose
reports
are
contradictory
according
to
one
of
their
own
writers
of
the
period
they
suffered
no
loss
whatever
in
vessels
yet
at
the
same
time
he
asserts
we
gave
them
haleklumbya
which
must
be
the
name
of
a
ship
a
gallant
fight
but
can
you
explain
how
such
an
inferior
people
could
become
heroic
of
a
sudden
according
to
an
early
british
historian
they
were
addicted
to
surprising
feats
upon
the
water
and
this
statement
is
borne
out
by
a
spanish
admiral
who
maintains
that
the
mehrikans
being
a
godless
people
were
aided
by
the
devil
we
are
on
the
river
that
leads
to
washington
says
we
shall
sight
it
the
river
is
a
dirty
color
we
see
ahead
of
us
the
ruins
of
a
great
dome
also
a
very
high
shaft
probably
they
belong
to
the
city
we
seek
illustration
we
see
ahead
of
us
the
ruins
of
a
great
dome
also
a
very
high
shaft
a
date
we
shall
not
forget
little
did
i
realize
this
morning
when
we
left
the
in
such
hilarious
mood
what
dire
events
awaited
us
i
landed
about
noon
accompanied
by
nōfūhl
kuzundam
the
first
mate
the
cook
and
two
sailors
our
march
had
scarce
begun
when
a
startling
discovery
caused
great
commotion
in
our
minds
we
had
halted
at
request
to
decipher
the
inscription
upon
a
stone
when
who
had
started
on
stopped
short
with
a
sudden
exclamation
we
hastened
to
him
and
there
in
the
soft
earth
was
the
imprint
of
human
feet
i
can
not
describe
our
surprise
we
decided
to
follow
the
footprints
and
soon
found
they
were
leading
us
toward
the
great
dome
more
directly
than
we
could
have
gone
ourselves
our
excitement
was
beyond
words
those
of
us
who
had
weapons
carried
them
in
readiness
the
path
was
little
used
but
clearly
marked
it
wound
about
among
fallen
fragments
and
crumbling
statues
and
took
us
along
a
wide
avenue
between
buildings
of
vast
size
and
solidity
far
superior
to
any
we
had
seen
in
it
seemed
a
city
of
monuments
illustration
through
the
streets
of
washington
as
we
ascended
the
hill
to
the
great
temple
and
saw
it
through
the
trees
rising
high
above
us
we
were
much
impressed
by
its
vast
size
and
beauty
our
eyes
wandered
in
admiration
over
the
massive
columns
each
hewn
from
a
single
block
still
white
and
fresh
as
if
newly
quarried
the
path
took
us
under
one
of
the
lower
arches
of
the
building
and
we
emerged
upon
the
other
side
this
front
we
found
even
more
beautiful
than
the
one
facing
the
city
at
the
centre
was
a
flight
of
steps
of
magnificent
proportions
now
falling
asunder
and
overgrown
in
many
places
with
grass
and
flowers
illustration
the
ruins
of
the
great
temple
these
steps
we
ascended
as
i
climbed
silently
up
the
others
following
i
saw
two
human
feet
the
soles
toward
us
resting
upon
the
balustrade
above
with
a
gesture
i
directed
nōfūhl
attention
to
them
and
the
old
man
eyes
twinkled
with
delight
was
it
a
mehrikan
i
confess
to
a
lively
excitement
at
the
prospect
of
meeting
one
how
many
were
they
and
how
would
they
treat
us
looking
down
upon
my
little
band
to
see
that
all
were
there
i
boldly
marched
up
the
remaining
steps
and
stood
before
him
he
was
reclining
upon
a
curious
little
seat
with
his
feet
upon
the
balustrade
about
on
a
level
with
his
head
clad
in
skins
and
rough
cloth
he
looked
much
like
a
hunter
and
he
gazed
quietly
upon
me
as
though
a
persian
noble
were
a
daily
guest
such
a
reception
was
not
gratifying
especially
as
he
remained
in
the
same
position
not
even
withdrawing
his
feet
he
nodded
his
curious
head
down
once
and
up
again
deeming
it
apparently
a
sufficient
salutation
illustration
he
remained
in
the
same
position
not
even
withdrawing
his
feet
the
maintenance
of
my
own
dignity
before
my
followers
forbade
my
standing
thus
before
a
seated
barbarian
and
i
made
a
gesture
for
him
to
rise
this
he
answered
in
an
unseemly
manner
by
ejecting
from
his
mouth
a
brownish
fluid
projecting
it
over
and
beyond
the
balustrade
in
front
of
him
then
looking
upon
me
as
if
about
to
laugh
and
yet
with
a
grave
face
he
uttered
something
in
an
unmusical
voice
which
i
failed
to
understand
illustration
the
feet
upon
the
portico
upon
this
nōfūhl
who
had
caught
the
meaning
of
one
or
two
words
stepped
hastily
forward
and
addressed
him
in
his
own
language
but
the
barbarian
understood
with
difficulty
and
they
had
much
trouble
in
conversing
chiefly
from
reason
of
nōfūhl
pronunciation
he
afterward
told
me
that
this
man
language
differed
but
little
from
that
of
the
mehrikans
as
they
wrote
it
eleven
centuries
ago
when
he
finally
arose
in
talking
with
nōfūhl
i
could
better
observe
him
he
was
tall
and
bony
with
an
awkward
neck
and
appeared
at
first
glance
to
be
a
man
of
forty
years
we
decided
later
he
was
under
thirty
his
yellow
skin
and
want
of
hair
made
him
seem
much
older
than
he
was
i
was
also
much
puzzled
by
the
expression
of
his
face
it
was
one
of
deep
sadness
yet
his
eyes
were
full
of
mirth
and
a
corner
of
his
mouth
was
ever
drawing
up
as
if
in
mockery
for
myself
i
liked
not
his
manner
he
appeared
little
impressed
by
so
many
strangers
and
bore
himself
as
though
it
were
of
small
importance
whether
we
understood
him
or
not
but
nōfūhl
since
informed
me
that
he
asked
a
multitude
of
questions
concerning
us
illustration
the
man
what
nōfūhl
gathered
was
this
this
mehrikan
with
his
wife
and
one
old
man
were
all
that
remained
of
his
race
had
died
this
summer
in
ancient
times
there
were
many
millions
of
his
they
were
the
greatest
nation
upon
the
earth
he
could
not
read
he
had
two
names
one
was
jon
the
other
he
had
forgotten
they
lived
in
this
temple
because
it
was
cool
when
the
temple
was
built
and
for
what
purpose
he
could
not
tell
he
pointed
to
the
west
and
said
the
country
in
that
direction
was
covered
with
ruined
cities
when
nōfūhl
told
him
we
were
friends
and
presented
him
at
my
direction
with
a
of
fine
workmanship
he
pushed
out
his
right
arm
toward
me
and
held
it
there
for
an
instant
nōfūhl
looked
at
the
arm
wonderingly
as
did
we
all
then
with
sudden
intelligence
he
seized
the
outstretched
hand
in
his
own
and
moved
it
up
and
down
this
was
interesting
for
nōfūhl
tells
me
it
was
a
form
of
greeting
among
the
ancient
mehrikans
while
all
this
was
going
on
we
had
moved
into
the
great
circular
hall
beneath
the
dome
this
hall
was
of
vast
proportions
and
there
were
still
traces
of
its
former
splendor
against
the
walls
were
marble
statues
entwined
in
ivy
looking
down
upon
us
with
melancholy
eyes
here
also
we
met
a
thin
old
man
whose
hairless
head
and
beardless
face
almost
moved
us
to
mirth
at
nōfūhl
request
our
host
led
the
way
into
some
of
the
smaller
rooms
to
show
us
their
manner
of
living
and
it
would
be
impossible
to
imagine
a
more
pathetic
mixture
of
glory
and
decay
of
wealth
and
poverty
of
civilization
and
barbarity
old
furniture
dishes
of
silver
bronze
images
even
paintings
and
ornaments
of
great
value
were
scattered
through
the
rooms
side
by
side
with
the
most
primitive
implements
it
was
plain
the
ancient
arts
were
long
since
forgotten
when
we
returned
to
the
circular
hall
our
host
disappeared
for
a
few
moments
into
a
room
which
he
had
not
shown
us
he
came
back
bringing
a
stone
vase
with
a
narrow
neck
and
was
followed
by
a
maiden
who
bore
of
copper
and
tin
these
she
deposited
upon
a
fallen
fragment
of
the
dome
which
served
as
a
table
this
girl
was
interesting
a
dainty
head
delicate
features
yellow
hair
blue
eyes
and
a
gentle
sadness
of
mien
that
touched
my
heart
had
she
been
ugly
what
a
different
ending
to
this
day
we
all
saluted
her
and
the
mehrikan
spoke
a
few
words
which
we
interpreted
as
a
presentation
he
filled
the
cups
from
the
stone
vase
and
then
saying
something
which
nōfūhl
failed
to
catch
he
held
his
cup
before
his
face
with
a
peculiar
movement
and
put
it
to
his
lips
as
he
did
this
clutched
my
arm
and
exclaimed
the
very
gesture
of
the
ghost
and
then
as
if
to
himself
and
this
is
july
fourth
but
he
drank
as
did
we
all
for
our
thirst
was
great
and
the
odor
of
the
golden
liquid
was
most
alluring
it
tasted
hotter
than
the
fires
of
jelbuz
it
was
also
of
great
potency
and
gave
a
fine
exhilaration
to
the
senses
we
became
happier
at
once
and
here
it
was
that
did
a
fatal
thing
being
near
the
maid
and
much
affected
by
her
beauty
he
addressed
her
as
the
most
angelic
of
women
which
of
course
she
understood
not
this
were
well
had
he
gone
no
further
but
he
next
put
his
arm
about
her
waist
with
intent
to
kiss
her
much
terrified
she
tried
to
free
herself
but
holding
her
fair
chin
with
his
other
hand
had
brought
his
lips
almost
to
hers
when
the
old
man
raised
his
heavy
staff
and
brought
it
down
upon
our
comrade
head
with
cruel
swiftness
this
falling
stick
upon
a
solid
skull
resounded
about
the
dome
and
echoed
through
the
empty
corridors
blinked
and
staggered
back
then
with
fury
in
his
face
he
sprang
savagely
toward
the
aged
man
but
here
the
younger
mehrikan
interfered
rapidly
approaching
them
and
shutting
tight
his
bony
hand
he
shot
it
from
him
with
startling
velocity
so
directing
that
it
came
in
contact
with
the
face
of
who
to
our
amazement
sat
roughly
upon
the
marble
pavement
the
blood
streaming
from
his
nostrils
he
was
a
pitiful
sight
unaccustomed
to
such
warfare
we
were
seriously
alarmed
and
thought
him
killed
perhaps
a
mighty
wrestler
and
of
powerful
build
rushed
furiously
upon
the
mehrikan
for
whom
i
trembled
but
his
arm
again
went
out
before
him
and
likewise
sat
a
mournful
spectacle
and
every
persian
felt
his
heart
beat
fast
within
him
by
this
time
was
on
his
feet
again
purple
with
rage
with
uplifted
scimitar
he
sprang
toward
our
host
the
old
man
stepped
between
with
wanton
cruelty
brought
his
steel
upon
the
ancient
head
and
stretched
him
upon
the
floor
for
an
instant
the
younger
one
stood
then
snatching
from
the
floor
the
patriarch
staff
a
heavy
stick
with
an
iron
end
he
jumped
forward
and
quicker
than
words
can
tell
it
dealt
a
frightful
blow
upon
the
head
of
which
sent
him
headlong
to
the
ground
with
a
broken
skull
illustration
the
slaughter
of
the
persians
all
this
had
happened
in
a
moment
and
wild
confusion
followed
my
followers
drew
their
arms
and
rushed
upon
the
mehrikan
the
girl
ran
forward
either
from
terror
or
to
shield
her
spouse
i
know
not
which
when
a
flying
arrow
from
a
sailor
pierced
her
to
the
heart
this
gave
the
mehrikan
the
energy
of
twenty
men
he
knocked
brave
kuzundam
senseless
with
a
blow
that
would
have
killed
an
ox
such
fury
i
had
not
conceived
he
brought
his
flying
staff
like
a
thunderbolt
from
heaven
upon
the
persian
skulls
yet
always
edging
toward
the
door
to
prevent
his
enemies
surrounding
him
four
of
our
number
in
as
many
minutes
joined
upon
the
floor
kuzundam
and
a
sailor
lay
stretched
upon
the
pavement
all
dead
or
grievously
wounded
so
suddenly
had
this
taken
place
that
i
hardly
realized
what
had
happened
i
rushed
forward
to
stay
the
combat
but
he
mistook
the
purpose
struck
my
scimitar
with
a
force
that
sent
it
flying
through
the
air
and
had
raised
his
staff
to
deal
a
second
for
myself
when
brave
stepped
in
to
save
me
and
thrust
quickly
at
him
but
alas
the
mehrikan
warded
off
his
stroke
with
one
yet
quicker
and
brought
his
stick
so
swiftly
against
my
comrade
head
that
it
laid
him
with
the
others
when
fell
i
saw
the
mehrikan
had
many
wounds
for
my
comrades
had
made
a
savage
onslaught
he
tottered
as
he
moved
back
into
the
doorway
where
he
leaned
against
the
wall
for
an
instant
his
eyes
meeting
ours
with
a
look
of
defiance
and
contempt
that
i
would
willingly
forget
then
the
staff
dropped
from
his
hand
he
staggered
out
to
the
great
portico
and
fell
his
length
upon
the
pavement
nōfūhl
hastened
to
him
but
he
was
dead
illustration
the
last
of
the
mehrikans
as
he
fell
a
wonderful
thing
took
place
an
impossible
thing
as
i
look
back
upon
it
but
both
nōfūhl
and
i
saw
it
distinctly
in
front
of
the
great
steps
and
facing
this
doorway
is
a
large
sitting
image
of
as
the
mehrikan
staggered
out
upon
the
porch
his
hands
outstretched
before
him
and
with
death
at
his
heart
this
statue
slowly
bowed
its
head
as
if
in
recognition
of
a
gallant
fight
perhaps
it
was
the
sorrowful
acceptance
of
a
bitter
ending
illustration
this
statue
slowly
bowed
its
head
again
upon
the
sea
this
time
for
persia
bearing
our
wounded
and
the
ashes
of
the
dead
those
of
the
natives

reposing

skull
