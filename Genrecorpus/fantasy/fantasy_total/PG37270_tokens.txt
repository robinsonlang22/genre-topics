we
have
had
some
strange
adventures
together
though
not
as
strange
and
exciting
as
the
ones
treated
of
in
this
story
at
any
rate
accept
it
as
a
souvenir
of
those
gay
days
before
the
war
which
now
seem
an
age
away
recall
a
christmas
dinner
in
the
villa
sanglier
by
the
belgian
sea
a
certain
moonlit
midnight
in
the
grand
place
of
an
ancient
famous
city
and
above
all
the
stir
and
ardors
of

bt
the
details
of
this
prologue
to
the
astounding
occurrences
which
it
is
my
privilege
to
chronicle
were
supplied
to
me
when
my
work
was
just
completed
it
forms
the
starting
point
of
the
story
which
travels
straight
onwards
the
city
in
the
clouds
prologue
under
a
gay
awning
of
red
and
white
which
covered
a
portion
of
the
famous
of
the
palacete
mendoza
at
rio
reclined
gideon
mendoza
morse
the
richest
man
in
brazil
and
it
was
said
the
third
richest
man
in
the
world
he
lay
in
a
silken
hammock
smoking
those
little
brazilian
cigarettes
which
are
made
of
fragrant
black
tobacco
and
wrapped
in
maize
leaf
it
was
afternoon
the
hour
of
the
siesta
from
where
he
lay
the
millionaire
could
look
down
upon
his
marvelous
gardens
which
surrounded
the
white
palace
he
had
built
for
himself
peerless
in
the
whole
of
south
america
the
trunks
of
great
trees
were
draped
with
lianas
bearing
flowers
of
every
hue
there
were
lawns
edged
with
myrtle
mimosa
covered
with
the
golden
rain
of
their
blossoms
immense
palms
lazily
waving
their
fans
in
the
breeze
of
the
afternoon
and
set
in
the
lawns
were
marble
pools
of
clear
water
from
the
center
of
which
fountains
sprang
there
was
a
continual
murmur
of
insects
and
flashes
of
light
as
the
tiny
brilliant
humming
birds
whirred
among
the
flowers
great
butterflies
of
blue
silver
and
vermilion
butterflies
as
large
as
bats
flapped
languidly
over
the
ivory
ferns
and
the
air
was
spicy
and
scented
with
vanilla
beyond
the
gardens
was
the
bay
of
rio
de
janeiro
the
most
beautiful
bay
in
all
the
world
dominated
by
the
great
mountain
the
pão
de
azucar
and
studded
with
green
islands
gideon
morse
took
a
pair
of
from
a
table
by
his
side
and
focused
them
upon
the
harbor
a
large
white
yacht
lying
off
governador
swam
into
the
circle
a
boat
driven
by
turbines
and
oil
fuel
the
fastest
and
largest
private
yacht
in
existence
gideon
morse
gave
a
little
quiet
patient
sigh
as
if
of
relief
he
was
a
man
of
sixty
odd
with
a
thick
thatch
of
white
hair
which
came
down
upon
his
wrinkled
forehead
in
a
peak
his
face
was
tanned
to
the
color
of
an
old
saddle
his
nose
beaked
like
a
hawk
and
his
mouth
was
a
mere
lipless
cut
which
might
have
been
made
by
a
knife
a
strong
jaw
completed
an
impression
of
abnormal
quiet
and
long
enduring
strength
indeed
the
whole
face
was
a
mask
of
immobility
beneath
heavy
black
brows
were
eyes
as
dark
as
night
clear
but
without
expression
no
one
looking
at
them
could
ever
tell
what
were
the
thoughts
behind
for
the
rest
he
was
a
man
of
medium
height
wiry
and
agile
a
brief
sketch
of
gideon
mendoza
morse
career
must
be
given
here
his
mother
was
a
spanish
lady
of
good
family
resident
in
brazil
his
father
an
american
gentleman
of
old
virginia
who
had
settled
there
after
the
war
between
north
and
south
morse
was
born
a
native
of
brazil
his
parents
left
him
a
moderate
fortune
which
he
proceeded
to
expand
with
extraordinary
rapidity
and
success
when
the
last
emperor
dom
pedro
was
deposed
in
gideon
mendoza
morse
was
indeed
a
rich
man
and
a
prominent
politician
he
took
a
great
part
in
establishing
the
republic
though
in
his
earlier
years
he
had
leaned
towards
the
monarchy
and
he
shared
in
the
immense
prosperity
which
followed
the
change
his
was
not
a
paper
fortune
the
fluctuations
of
stocks
and
shares
could
hardly
influence
it
he
owned
immense
coffee
plantations
in
para
and
was
practically
the
monopolist
of
the
sugar
regions
of
maranhao
but
his
greatest
revenues
came
from
his
immense
holdings
in
gold
manganese
and
diamond
mines
he
had
married
a
spanish
lady
early
in
his
career
and
was
now
a
widower
with
one
daughter
she
came
up
upon
the
now
a
tall
slip
of
a
girl
with
an
immense
quantity
of
lustrous
hair
and
a
voice
as
clear
as
an
evening
bell
father
she
said
in
english
she
had
been
at
school
at
eastbourne
and
had
no
trace
of
spanish
accent
what
is
the
exact
hour
that
we
sail
morse
slipped
out
of
the
hammock
and
took
her
arm
in
his
at
ten
juanita
he
replied
patting
her
hand
are
you
glad
then
glad
i
can
not
tell
you
how
much
to
leave
all
this
he
waved
his
hand
at
what
was
probably
the
most
perfect
prospect
earth
has
to
offer
to
leave
all
this
for
the
fogs
and
gloom
of
london
i
do
mind
the
fogs
which
by
the
way
are
tremendously
exaggerated
of
course
i
love
rio
father
but
i
long
to
be
in
london
the
heart
of
the
world
where
all
the
nicest
people
are
and
where
a
girl
has
freedom
such
as
she
never
has
here
freedom
he
said
ah
and
was
about
to
continue
when
a
native
indian
servant
in
a
uniform
of
white
linen
with
gold
shoulder
knots
advanced
towards
them
with
a
salver
upon
which
were
two
calling
cards
morse
took
the
cards
a
slight
gleam
came
into
his
eyes
and
passed
leaving
his
face
as
impassive
as
before
you
must
run
away
darling
he
said
to
juanita
i
have
to
see
some
gentlemen
are
all
your
preparations
made
everything
all
the
luggage
has
gone
down
to
the
harbor
except
just
a
couple
of
which
my
maid
has
very
well
then
we
will
have
an
early
meal
and
leave
at
dusk
the
girl
flitted
away
morse
gave
some
directions
to
the
servant
and
shortly
after
the
rattle
of
a
lift
was
heard
from
a
little
cupola
in
one
corner
of
the
roof
two
men
stepped
out
and
came
among
the
palms
and
flowers
to
the
millionaire
one
was
a
thin
elderly
man
with
a
white
mustache
the
marquis
da
silva
his
companion
powerful
and
obviously
with
a
touch
of
the
in
him
don
zorilla
y
toro
pray
be
seated
said
morse
with
a
low
bow
though
he
did
not
offer
to
shake
hands
with
either
of
them
may
i
ask
to
what
i
owe
the
pleasure
of
this
visit
it
is
very
simple
señor
said
the
marquis
and
you
must
have
expected
a
visit
sooner
or
later
the
old
man
speaking
in
the
pure
spanish
of
castille
trembled
a
little
as
he
sat
at
a
round
table
of
red
encrusted
with
we
are
in
short
said
the
burly
zorilla
ambassadors
they
were
now
all
seated
round
the
table
under
the
shade
of
a
palm
whose
great
fans
clicked
against
each
other
in
the
evening
breeze
which
began
to
blow
from
the
cool
heights
of
the
mountain
the
face
of
gideon
morse
was
inscrutable
as
ever
it
might
have
been
a
mask
of
leather
but
the
old
spanish
nobleman
was
obviously
ill
at
ease
and
the
bulging
eyes
of
the
with
his
diamond
cuff
links
and
ring
spoke
of
suppressed
and
furious
passion
in
a
moment
tragedy
had
come
into
this
paradise
yes
we
are
ambassadors
echoed
the
marquis
with
a
certain
eagerness
a
grand
and
word
said
gideon
morse
i
may
be
permitted
to
ask
from
whom
quick
as
lightning
don
zorilla
held
out
his
hand
over
the
table
opened
it
and
closed
it
again
there
was
a
little
glint
of
light
from
his
palm
as
he
did
so
morse
leant
back
in
his
chair
and
smiled
then
he
lit
one
of
his
pungent
cigarettes
so
are
you
playing
with
those
toys
still
gentlemen
the
marquis
flushed
mendoza
he
said
this
is
idle
trifling
you
must
know
very
well
i
know
nothing
i
want
to
know
nothing
the
marquis
said
two
words
in
a
low
voice
and
then
the
heads
of
the
three
men
drew
very
close
together
for
two
or
three
minutes
there
was
a
whispering
like
the
rustle
of
the
dry
grasses
of
the
brazilian
campos
and
then
morse
drew
back
his
chair
with
a
harsh
noise
enough
he
said
you
are
madmen
dreamers
you
come
to
me
after
all
these
years
to
ask
me
to
be
a
party
in
destroying
the
peace
and
prosperity
our
great
country
enjoys
and
has
enjoyed
for
more
than
thirty
years
you
ask
me
twice
president
of
the
republic
which
i
helped
to
make
zorilla
lifted
his
hand
and
the
great
brazilian
diamonds
in
his
rings
shot
out
baleful
fires
enough
señor
he
said
in
a
thick
voice
that
is
your
unalterable
decision
morse
laughed
contemptuously
while
azucar
stands
he
said
i
stand
where
i
am
and
nothing
will
change
me
you
stand
where
you
are
mendoza
said
the
marquis
with
a
new
gravity
and
dignity
in
his
voice
but
i
assure
you
it
will
not
be
for
long
you
have
two
years
to
run
that
true
but
at
the
end
of
them
be
sure
oh
be
very
sure
that
the
end
will
come
and
swiftly
morse
rose
i
will
endeavor
to
put
the
remaining
two
years
to
good
use
he
said
with
grim
and
almost
contemptuous
mockery
do
so
señor
said
zorilla
but
remember
that
in
our
forests
the
traveler
may
press
onward
for
days
and
weeks
and
all
the
time
in
the
the
silent
jaguar
is
following
following
waiting
i
have
traveled
a
good
deal
in
our
forests
in
my
youth
don
zorilla
i
have
even
slain
many
jaguars
the
three
men
looked
at
each
other
steadily
and
long
then
the
two
visitors
bowed
and
turned
to
go
but
just
as
they
were
moving
off
towards
the
lift
dome
zorilla
turned
back
and
held
out
a
card
to
don
mendoza
it
was
an
ordinary
visiting
card
with
a
name
engraved
upon
it
morse
took
it
looked
at
the
name
and
then
stood
still
and
frozen
in
his
tracks
he
did
not
move
until
the
whirr
of
the
bell
and
the
clang
of
the
gate
told
him
the
was
his
own
again
then
he
staggered
to
the
table
like
a
drunken
man
sank
into
a
chair
and
bowed
his
head
upon
the
gleaming
pearl
and
crimson
chapter
one
when
my
father
died
and
left
me
his
large
fortune
i
also
inherited
that
very
successful
london
newspaper
the
i
decided
to
edit
it
myself
to
be
to
live
at
high
pressure
to
go
everywhere
see
everything
know
everybody
and
above
all
to
have
power
this
is
success
in
life
i
would
not
have
changed
my
position
in
london
for
the
premiership
on
the
evening
of
lady
brentford
dance
i
dined
alone
in
my
piccadilly
flat
there
was
nothing
much
doing
in
the
way
of
politics
and
i
had
been
playing
golf
at
sandown
the
whole
of
the
day
i
had
seen
the
paper
until
now
when
preston
brought
it
in
the
last
edition
and
i
opened
it
over
my
coffee
there
were
and
are
few
things
that
i
love
better
than
the
i
claim
for
it
that
it
is
the
most
evening
newspaper
in
england
bright
and
readable
from
the
word
go
and
singularly
accurate
in
all
its
information
there
was
a
long
time
yet
before
i
need
dress
and
i
sat
by
the
balcony
with
the
mellow
noises
of
piccadilly
on
an
early
summer
evening
pouring
into
the
room
and
read
the
rag
through
on
one
of
the
last
pages
where
the
society
gossip
and
women
chat
appear
i
saw
something
that
interested
me
old
miss
easey
who
writes
the
society
news
was
one
of
my
most
valued
contributors
with
her
hooked
nose
her
beady
black
eyes
and
marvelous
wig
she
went
everywhere
by
right
of
birth
for
she
was
connected
with
half
the
peerage
her
news
was
accurate
and
real
she
faked
nothing
because
she
got
all
her
stuff
from
the
inside
and
this
was
known
all
over
london
she
was
well
worth
the
thousand
a
year
i
paid
her
and
the
daily
column
signed
vera
was
an
accepted
fact
in
the
life
of
london
society
the
old
girl
had
let
herself
go
it
seemed
of
course
there
had
been
paragraphs
in
the
papers
for
some
days
that
the
great
brazilian
millionaire
gideon
mendoza
morse
had
exploded
in
society
like
a
bomb
he
had
taken
a
whole
floor
of
the
ritz
hotel
and
it
was
rumored
that
he
was
going
to
buy
an
empty
palace
in
park
lane
and
astonish
town
every
one
was
saying
that
he
had
wealth
beyond
the
dreams
of
avarice
which
is
of
course
awful
rot
when
you
come
to
think
of
it
because
there
are
no
bounds
whatever
to
avarice
vera
was
not
expatiating
upon
the
brazil
nut
wealth
but
upon
his
only
daughter
it
was
put
in
a
veiled
way
and
that
with
reticence
for
which
we
paid
miss
easey
a
thousand
a
year
no
cheap
gush
thank
you
in
the
that
miss
morse
was
a
young
girl
of
such
superlative
loveliness
that
there
was
not
a
débutante
to
come
within
a
mile
of
her
i
gathered
also
that
the
young
lady
first
very
public
appearance
was
to
be
made
at
the
house
of
the
marchioness
of
brentford
in
belgrave
square
the
news
certainly
gave
an
additional
interest
to
the
prospect
of
the
evening
and
i
wondered
what
the
girl
was
really
like
i
had
motored
up
from
sandown
and
sat
down
to
dinner
as
i
was
perhaps
i
was
rather
tired
but
as
i
sat
by
the
window
and
dusk
came
over
the
green
park
while
all
the
lights
of
piccadilly
were
lit
i
sank
into
a
sort
of
doze
assisted
by
the
deep
hum
of
the
everlasting
traffic
yes
i
must
really
have
fallen
asleep
for
i
was
certainly
in
the
middle
of
some
wild
and
alluring
adventure
when
i
woke
with
a
start
to
find
all
the
lights
in
my
turned
on
preston
standing
by
the
door
and
pat
moore
shaking
me
violently
by
the
shoulder
confound
you
do
do
that
i
shouted
jumping
up
pat
moore
was
six
feet
two
in
height
and
the
heaviest
man
in
the
irish
guards
hallo
what
are
you
doing
here
it
myself
that
has
looked
in
for
a
drink
he
said
i
thought
go
to
the
ball
together
i
was
a
little
more
awake
by
this
time
and
saw
that
pat
was
in
full
evening
kit
and
very
grand
he
looked
he
was
supposed
to
be
the
handsomest
man
in
london
on
the
large
swaggering
side
and
certainly
whether
in
uniform
or
mufti
he
was
a
very
splendid
figure
nevertheless
he
had
no
more
idea
of
side
than
a
spaniel
dog
and
he
was
just
about
as
kind
and
faithful
as
the
sportsman
friend
he
possessed
a
certain
downright
honesty
and
common
sense
that
endeared
him
to
every
one
though
his
own
mother
would
hardly
have
called
him
clever
at
an
earlier
period
of
our
lives
he
had
caned
me
a
good
deal
at
eton
and
it
was
difficult
to
get
out
of
his
dear
stupid
old
head
that
he
had
not
some
vague
rights
over
me
in
that
direction
still
now
tom
he
said
pouring
himself
out
a
mighty
drink
for
his
head
was
you
go
and
make
yourself
look
pretty
and
then
come
back
here
i
have
something
to
tell
you
i
went
obediently
away
bathed
shaved
was
assisted
by
preston
into
evening
clothes
and
returned
to
the
about
a
quarter
to
ten
what
have
you
got
to
tell
me
pat
he
thought
for
a
moment
i
believe
that
he
always
had
to
summon
his
words
out
of
some
cupboard
in
his
brain
tom
i
seen
the
most
beautiful
girl
in
the
world
then
leg
it
pat
hare
away
from
temptation
or
she
have
you
pat
had
ten
thousand
a
year
and
had
been
a
dead
mark
for
all
sorts
of
schemes
for
the
last
two
years
do
be
a
silly
ass
tom
you
do
know
what
you
talking
about
this
is
serious
i
do
know
who
talking
about
he
was
heaving
himself
out
of
his
chair
to
explain
when
the
door
opened
and
preston
announced
lord
arthur
winstanley
hallo
what
brings
you
here
i
said
thought
i
come
in
for
a
drink
saw
you
were
going
to
tom
thought
we
might
as
well
be
going
together
hallo
pat
you
coming
along
too
thought
of
doin
so
said
captain
moore
arthur
threw
himself
into
a
chair
slim
clean
shaved
with
curly
black
hair
and
dark
blue
eyes
his
clever
face
alive
with
youth
and
vitality
tom
he
said
to
me
you
are
going
to
see
the
most
beautiful
girl
in
the
world
hallo
pat
shouted
you
seen
her
too
seen
her
of
course
i
have
mother
giving
the
dance
for
her
then
i
understood
oh
miss
morse
i
said
jooaneeta
said
pat
in
his
rich
irish
voice
generally
pronounced
soft
like
tropic
moonlight
my
old
geranium
said
arthur
sure
your
pronunciation
wo
do
at
all
at
all
pat
twirled
the
end
of
his
huge
mustache
then
he
heaved
a
cushion
you
and
your
talk
he
said
well
i
not
seen
her
i
remarked
but
i
quite
willing
to
take
the
word
of
two
experts
is
it
about
time
we
went
winstanley
produced
a
platinum
watch
no
thicker
than
a
from
the
pocket
of
his
white
waistcoat
well
perhaps
it
might
be
he
said
we
can
take
up
strategic
positions
and
get
there
before
the
crush
although
i
do
live
at
home
i
got
a
snug
little
couple
of
rooms
they
keep
for
me
and
mother
will
see
that
he
smiled
to
himself
now
look
here
i
said
fair
does
you
are
already
up
the
course
with
the
fair
brazilian
but
do
let
your
pals
have
a
chance
i
suppose
all
the
world
will
be
round
her
but
do
see
that
pat
and
i
have
a
small
look
in
of
course
i
will
we
done
too
much
hunting
together
we
three
i
tell
you
tom
you
will
be
bowled
clean
over
at
the
very
sight
of
her
there
never
was
such
a
girl
since
cleopatra
was
a
flapper
now
send
old
preston
for
a
taxi
and
we
get
to
cover
side
it
was
about
ten
as
we
entered
the
hospitable
portals
of
brentford
house
in
belgrave
square
there
was
a
tremendous
crush
i
never
remember
seeing
so
many
people
at
lady
brentford
for
though
everybody
went
to
her
parties
they
were
never
overcrowded
owing
to
the
immense
size
of
the
famous
old
london
house
pat
moore
and
i
kept
close
to
arthur
who
as
a
son
of
the
house
knew
his
way
a
great
deal
better
than
we
did
and
we
soon
found
ourselves
at
the
top
of
the
staircase
and
close
to
the
alcove
where
lady
brentford
and
her
daughter
lady
joan
winstanley
were
standing
while
i
saw
the
bald
head
of
the
marquis
who
was
as
innocent
of
hair
as
a
new
laid
egg
shining
in
the
background
dear
lady
brentford
greeted
pat
who
had
formed
a
sort
of
for
us
on
the
staircase
with
marked
kindness
it
was
thought
that
she
saw
in
him
a
prospective
husband
for
arthur
sister
after
greeting
his
mother
and
asking
a
question
arthur
went
off
at
once
and
my
turn
came
my
dear
sir
thomas
i
am
so
glad
to
see
you
are
you
like
all
the
other
young
men
in
london
i
sincerely
hope
not
i
told
her
though
i
knew
very
well
what
she
meant
we
were
old
friends
and
she
was
not
deceived
for
a
moment
i
understand
you
perfectly
you
wicked
boy
well
then
lady
brentford
i
lowered
my
voice
has
she
come
her
eyes
gleamed
not
yet
but
i
am
expecting
her
every
moment
now
i
am
going
to
be
kind
to
you
you
wait
here
just
a
little
behind
me
and
i
introduce
you
at
once
i
hope
i
looked
as
grateful
as
i
felt
for
i
confess
my
curiosity
was
greatly
aroused
and
besides
it
would
be
such
a
score
over
pat
and
arthur
there
something
in
power
after
all
had
i
been
merely
tom
kirby
whose
father
had
received
a
baronetcy
for
say
soap
lady
brentford
would
not
have
been
nearly
as
nice
even
though
arthur
and
i
had
been
bosom
friends
at
oxford
but
you
see
i
was
the
and
that
meant
much
especially
in
a
political
house
like
this
i
waited
and
talked
a
little
with
lord
brentford
that
sterling
member
of
more
cabinets
than
one
would
care
to
count
he
said
hum
and
then
ha
and
then
hum
again
which
was
the
extent
of
his
conversation
on
every
occasion
except
that
of
a
specially
good
dinner
when
he
added
ho
and
then
i
suppose
it
was
about
eleven
there
was
a
stir
and
a
movement
all
down
the
grand
staircase
except
that
the
band
in
the
ballroom
did
not
burst
into
the
strains
of
the
national
anthem
it
was
exactly
like
the
arrival
of
royalty
coming
up
the
staircase
was
a
man
of
medium
height
with
white
hair
a
brown
face
and
good
features
but
of
such
immobility
that
they
might
have
been
carved
in
sandstone
by
his
side
very
simply
dressed
and
wearing
no
ornament
but
one
rope
of
great
pearls
came
juanita
morse
if
i
live
for
a
thousand
years
i
shall
never
forget
that
first
vision
of
her
i
have
seen
all
the
beauties
of
london
paris
and
rome
danced
with
many
of
them
spoken
at
least
to
the
majority
but
never
before
or
since
have
i
seen
such
luminous
and
compelling
loveliness
it
is
almost
impossible
for
me
to
describe
her
a
presumption
indeed
when
so
many
abler
pens
than
mine
have
hymned
her
praises
the
poets
of
two
continents
have
lain
their
garlands
of
song
at
her
little
feet
she
has
been
the
theme
of
innumerable
articles
in
the
press
the
heroine
of
a
dozen
novels
and
yet
i
must
give
some
impression
of
her
i
suppose
she
was
slender
and
tall
though
not
too
tall
her
hair
which
must
have
fallen
to
her
feet
and
enveloped
her
like
a
cloud
of
night
was
dead
black
but
it
was
not
the
coarse
lifeless
black
of
so
many
women
of
the
latin
race
it
was
as
fine
as
spun
silk
gleaming
vital
and
full
of
electricity
a
live
thing
of
itself
so
it
seemed
to
me
her
eyes
were
unpolished
jet
but
hers
were
of
a
deep
large
lustrous
and
of
unfathomable
depth
they
were
never
the
same
for
two
moments
together
and
the
light
within
them
was
forever
new
but
the
good
of
a
catalogue
after
all
it
expresses
very
little
there
was
not
a
feature
of
her
face
not
a
line
of
her
form
that
was
not
perfect
and
her
smile
was
the
last
real
enchantment
left
in
the
modern
world
in
two
minutes
i
i
tom
kirby
was
walking
towards
the
ballroom
with
her
hand
upon
my
arm
how
all
the
women
stared
nodded
and
whispered
how
all
the
men
hated
me
i
caught
sight
of
pat
and
arthur
and
lo
their
faces
were
as
those
who
lie
in
wait
who
grin
like
dogs
and
run
about
the
city
as
i
told
them
some
hours
afterwards
thank
heavens
that
all
the
vulgar
modern
dances
were
not
only
perishing
of
their
own
inanity
at
that
time
but
had
never
been
allowed
in
brentford
house
the
best
band
in
town
had
begun
a
delightful
waltz
and
we
slipped
into
it
together
as
if
passing
through
curtains
into
dreamland
i
do
remember
that
we
said
very
much
to
each
other
certainly
i
was
not
going
to
ask
her
how
she
liked
london
and
so
forth
she
did
not
seem
the
sort
of
girl
to
appreciate
the
farthing
change
of
talk
but
somehow
or
other
we
conversed
with
our
eyes
i
was
as
certain
of
this
as
of
the
fact
that
i
was
dancing
with
her
and
long
after
in
a
situation
and
moment
of
the
most
deadly
peril
she
confessed
it
to
me
towards
the
end
of
the
dance
when
the
flutes
and
violins
glided
into
the
last
movement
i
said
this
miss
morse
i
know
that
i
am
doing
the
most
dreadful
thing
all
london
wants
to
dance
with
you
and
i
have
had
the
great
privilege
of
being
the
very
first
but
could
you
do
you
think
you
possibly
could
give
me
just
one
more
dance
later
on
in
the
evening
of
course
i
will
sir
thomas
she
said
and
her
voice
was
as
clear
as
an
evening
bell
i
think
you
dance
beautifully
we
circled
round
the
room
for
the
last
time
and
then
i
resigned
her
to
lady
brentford
who
was
looking
after
the
girl
with
an
eloquent
look
of
thanks
immediately
she
became
swallowed
up
by
a
regiment
of
black
coats
and
i
saw
her
no
more
for
a
time
i
am
extremely
fond
of
dancing
but
i
sought
out
no
other
damsel
now
but
went
to
a
buffet
and
drank
a
long
glass
of
iced
as
if
that
was
going
to
quench
the
fever
within
then
i
found
my
way
to
a
lonely
spot
in
one
of
the
conservatories
and
sat
thinking
hard
i
will
say
nothing
as
to
the
nature
of
my
reverie
it
may
very
easily
be
guessed
but
from
time
to
time
i
concentrated
all
my
powers
in
living
over
again
the
divine
moments
of
that
dance
i
was
finally
irrevocably
passionately
in
love
it
seems
the
maddest
thing
to
say
for
a
man
of
the
world
such
as
i
was
i
suppose
i
had
known
her
for
just
about
quarter
of
an
hour
and
yet
i
knew
that
there
would
never
be
any
other
woman
for
me
and
that
when
my
days
were
at
an
end
her
name
would
be
the
only
one
upon
my
lips
a
little
later
on
in
the
evening
before
my
second
and
final
dance
with
his
daughter
i
had
the
opportunity
of
a
talk
with
morse
himself
i
say
at
once
and
i
am
not
letting
myself
be
colored
by
what
happened
afterwards
and
the
intimate
relations
into
which
i
was
thrown
with
him
i
say
at
once
that
i
found
him
charming
there
was
an
immense
force
and
power
about
him
but
this
was
not
obtruded
upon
one
as
i
have
known
it
to
be
in
the
case
of
other
extremely
wealthy
and
successful
men
both
english
and
american
this
had
all
the
graces
of
speech
and
courtesy
of
manner
of
the
spanish
great
gentleman
and
curiously
enough
he
took
to
me
i
was
quite
certain
of
that
whether
he
wanted
to
use
me
in
any
way
and
of
the
people
i
met
generally
did
i
could
not
have
said
at
any
rate
i
determined
that
if
he
did
i
was
very
much
at
his
disposal
we
watched
miss
morse
dancing
with
old
pat
who
for
all
his
sixteen
stone
was
as
light
as
a
cat
on
his
feet
do
you
know
who
that
is
dancing
with
juanita
morse
asked
simply
oh
yes
captain
moore
patrick
moore
of
the
irish
guards
he
is
one
of
my
most
intimate
friends
and
one
of
the
best
fellows
in
the
world
then
morse
said
a
curious
thing
which
i
could
not
fathom
just
then
he
said
it
half
to
me
and
half
to
himself
in
a
curiously
thoughtful
a
fine
fellow
to
have
with
one
in
an
emergency
well
of
course
i
did
like
to
tell
him
that
dear
old
pat
while
he
had
common
sense
enough
to
come
indoors
while
it
rained
had
no
mind
in
the
real
sense
of
that
word
whatever
it
did
not
occur
to
me
for
a
moment
that
gideon
morse
might
have
been
speaking
simply
of
qualities
pat
face
was
marvelous
to
look
upon
it
was
one
great
glowing
mass
of
happiness
he
did
not
take
the
least
trouble
to
disguise
his
ecstasy
and
if
ever
a
man
showed
he
was
in
paradise
pat
moore
did
then
it
was
different
when
juanita
danced
with
arthur
his
handsome
clever
face
was
not
in
repose
for
a
moment
it
was
sharpened
by
eagerness
and
he
talked
incessantly
provoking
answering
smiles
and
flashes
from
the
wonderful
eyes
my
heart
sank
i
knew
how
arthur
winstanley
could
talk
when
he
chose
as
all
england
was
to
learn
two
or
three
years
later
when
he
entered
the
house
of
commons
and
that
man
the
low
resonant
voice
of
morse
was
again
in
my
ears
for
i
had
been
neglecting
my
duties
to
all
the
girls
i
knew
most
dreadfully
and
remained
with
him
for
the
space
of
three
dances
oh
that
another
friend
of
mine
lord
arthur
winstanley
he
is
a
son
of
the
house
the
second
son
charles
the
heir
is
with
his
regiment
in
india
morse
thanked
me
and
soon
afterwards
two
very
great
people
indeed
came
up
and
i
melted
away
i
went
to
my
seat
in
the
conservatory
again
i
did
not
care
how
rude
it
was
how
i
was
betraying
lady
hospitality
being
known
as
a
dancing
man
and
expected
to
dance
but
i
was
determined
not
to
touch
any
other
girl
that
night
until
juanita
morse
and
i
had
danced
again
together
it
came
and
passed
afterwards
i
slipped
downstairs
got
my
hat
and
overcoat
and
left
the
house
without
i
think
being
observed
by
any
one
the
night
air
was
fresh
and
sweet
and
i
determined
to
walk
before
i
reached
home
for
my
mind
was
in
a
whirl
of
sensation
i
turned
into
the
great
dark
cañon
of
victoria
street
which
was
almost
empty
and
heard
my
footsteps
echoing
up
the
sides
of
the
houses
i
caught
a
glimpse
of
the
moon
silvering
the
campanile
of
westminster
cathedral
and
when
i
reached
the
abbey
it
and
the
houses
of
parliament
were
washed
in
soft
and
brilliant
light
and
yet
somehow
i
could
not
think
i
could
not
survey
with
my
usual
cool
detachment
the
situation
which
had
suddenly
risen
in
my
life
i
remember
that
the
predominant
feeling
was
a
wish
that
i
had
never
gone
to
lady
brentford
that
i
had
never
seen
or
spoken
to
juanita
morse
what
was
the
use
after
all
she
was
as
much
above
my
hopes
as
a
princess
of
the
royal
house
and
yet
i
knew
that
without
her
i
should
never
be
really
happy
again
it
was
in
a
sort
of
desperation
that
i
hurried
up
parliament
street
and
through
trafalgar
square
feeling
that
i
was
a
fool
and
mad
wanting
to
hide
my
shame
in
my
own
quiet
rooms
where
at
any
rate
i
should
be
alone
i
opened
the
door
with
my
yale
key
and
ran
lightly
up
the
stairs
to
the
flat
on
the
first
floor
which
i
occupied
as
i
went
into
the
lounge
hall
and
took
off
my
overcoat
preston
whom
i
had
not
told
to
wait
up
for
me
came
from
the
passage
leading
to
the
servants
quarters
carrying
a
tray
i
sha
want
any
supper
thank
you
preston
i
said
in
surprise
thank
you
sir
very
good
sir
he
replied
but
his
lordship
and
captain
moore
are
here
and
have
just
asked
for
something
my
first
emotion
was
one
of
unutterable
surprise
and
then
i
scowled
and
felt
inclined
to
swear
what
on
earth
were
those
two
doing
here
at
this
time
of
night
just
when
i
would
have
given
almost
anything
to
be
left
alone
i
hesitated
for
a
moment
and
then
walked
into
the
pat
was
seated
in
a
lounge
chair
smoking
a
cigar
arthur
was
pacing
up
and
down
the
carpet
neither
of
them
appeared
to
have
been
talking
and
as
i
came
in
they
looked
at
me
curiously
and
i
saw
that
their
faces
in
some
subtle
way
were
changed
they
were
my
best
friends
for
years
we
had
been
accustomed
to
treat
each
other
quarters
and
possessions
as
if
they
were
our
own
and
yet
now
i
felt
as
if
they
were
intruding
strangers
though
i
tried
hard
to
be
genial
hallo
i
said
in
a
voice
that
cracked
upon
the
word
did
expect
to
see
you
again
anything
special
preston
was
putting
his
tray
of
sandwiches
and
deviled
biscuits
on
the
table
so
we
could
not
say
much
but
directly
he
had
left
the
room
old
pat
got
up
from
his
chair
he
held
out
his
hand
pointing
at
me
with
a
trembling
finger
his
face
was
purple
you
you
danced
twice
with
her
he
said
so
that
was
it
i
grew
in
a
moment
i
wo
pretend
to
misunderstand
to
what
you
refer
i
said
but
what
the
devil
is
that
to
you
pat
do
be
a
fool
arthur
whipped
out
though
the
look
he
gave
me
which
he
tried
to
disguise
was
not
a
friendly
one
fool
is
hardly
the
word
i
said
kindly
explain
yourself
moore
and
forget
that
you
are
my
guest
if
you
like
i
do
mind
the
huge
man
trembled
then
he
turned
away
with
a
sort
of
snarl
snatched
his
handkerchief
from
his
cuff
and
mopped
his
face
i
sat
down
and
lit
a
cigarette
can
you
explain
this
arthur
i
asked
he
sat
down
too
and
began
to
tap
with
his
shoe
upon
the
carpet
oh
i
do
know
he
said
sullenly
you
were
the
only
man
in
the
room
kirby
to
whom
she
gave
more
than
one
dance
that
as
may
be
i
suppose
you
do
propose
to
expostulate
with
the
lady
herself
and
by
the
way
i
always
thought
that
it
was
exactly
form
to
discuss
these
things
in
the
way
you
appear
to
have
been
doing
that
got
arthur
on
the
mark
his
face
grew
very
white
and
he
sat
perfectly
still
then
pat
heaved
himself
round
she
not
for
you
at
any
rate
he
said
they
will
marry
her
to
a
duke
or
one
of
the
princes
suddenly
the
humor
of
all
this
struck
me
forcibly
and
i
lay
back
in
my
chair
and
burst
into
a
peal
of
laughter
that
quite
likely
i
said
though
i
do
think
what
i
have
seen
of
morse
that
he
is
likely
to
have
ambitions
that
way
and
i
am
quite
certain
that
miss
morse
will
marry
the
man
she
wants
to
marry
and
no
one
else
whether
he
is
a
thoroughbred
or
hairy
at
the
heels
i
think
all
this
talk
on
your
part
remember
you
began
it
pat
is
perfectly
disgraceful
to
say
nothing
of
its
utter
childishness
as
for
your
saying
that
a
young
lady
whom
i
have
met
for
the
first
time
and
danced
with
twice
is
not
for
me
it
a
damnable
piece
of
impertinence
that
you
should
dare
to
insinuate
that
i
look
upon
her
in
the
way
you
suggest
i
jumped
up
from
my
seat
and
knew
that
i
was
dominating
them
all
right
supposing
what
you
say
is
true
i
admit
that
my
chance
is
worth
two
o
cold
gin
though
it
every
bit
as
good
and
probably
better
than
yours
all
things
considered
you
are
certainly
a
fine
figure
of
a
man
i
was
furious
mad
keen
to
provoke
him
to
an
outburst
the
calculated
insult
was
patent
enough
i
thought
he
was
about
to
go
for
me
and
i
stood
ready
when
what
about
me
came
in
a
dry
crackling
voice
from
arthur
oh
i
should
put
you
and
me
about
level
i
said
with
the
courtesy
title
as
a
little
extra
weight
it
is
a
pity
you
should
be
the
second
son
damn
you
kirby
he
burst
out
blazing
with
anger
i
lifted
up
my
hand
and
looked
at
both
of
them
i
came
in
here
i
said
to
my
own
house
and
find
my
two
best
friends
that
i
thought
waiting
for
me
a
few
hours
ago
i
should
have
thought
such
a
scene
as
this
utterly
impossible
i
will
ask
you
both
to
remember
that
it
has
not
been
provoked
by
me
in
any
way
and
that
directly
i
came
in
you
turned
on
me
in
the
most
atrocious
and
way
of
your
idea
of
the
value
of
friendship
i
say
nothing
at
all
it
is
obvious
i
must
say
nothing
about
that
now
you
have
forced
the
pace
i
will
say
this
to
marry
that
young
lady
i
do
like
to
speak
her
name
even
is
about
as
difficult
as
to
dive
in
a
cork
jacket
or
keep
a
smelt
in
a
net
but
i
mean
to
try
i
mean
to
use
every
ounce
of
weight
i
got
i
shall
almost
certainly
fail
but
now
you
know
since
you
have
said
that
pat
broke
in
handicaps
be
damned
i
a
starter
for
the
same
stakes
and
it
hell
for
leather
i
ride
and
it
meself
that
says
it
tom
arthur
winstanley
spoke
last
i
a
fellow
of
a
good
many
ambitions
he
said
quietly
though
never
bothered
you
chaps
with
them
now
they
are
all
consolidated
into
one
then
we
all
stood
and
looked
at
each
other
the
cards
on
the
table
and
in
the
faces
of
the
other
two
at
least
there
was
uneasiness
and
shame
just
at
that
moment
a
funny
thing
happened
preston
had
brought
in
an
ice
pail
full
of
bottles
of
soda
water
the
heat
of
the
night
or
something
caused
one
of
the
corks
to
break
its
confining
wire
and
go
off
with
a
startling
report
while
a
fountain
of
foam
drenched
the
sandwiches
me
kingdom
for
a
drink
said
pat
oh
the
sweet
blessed
gurgling
sound
and
striding
to
the
table
he
mixed
a
gargantuan
peg
arthur
and
i
met
behind
pat
back
and
he
held
out
his
hand
to
me
biting
his
lower
lip
we
behaved
abominably
old
soul
he
said
the
big
guardsman
turned
round
and
raised
his
glass
on
high
here
to
the
sweetest
and
most
lovely
lady
in
the
world
bedad
he
shouted
accentuating
his
irish
brogue
may
the
best
man
win
her
fair
fight
and
no
favors
and
may
the
queen
of
heaven
and
all
the
saints
watch
over
the
little
darlint
and
guide
her
choice
aright
so
all
our
midnight
madness
passed
like
a
fleeting
cloud
an
extraordinary
accession
of
high
spirits
came
to
us
as
we
pledged
the
maiden
from
brazil
and
it
was
pat
dear
old
pat
who
welded
us
together
in
a
league
of
chivalry
against
which
nothing
was
ever
to
prevail
tom
he
said
arthur
we
are
all
like
brothers
we
always
have
been
let
there
be
no
change
in
that
now
or
ever
i
have
something
to
propose
go
on
pat
said
arthur
sure
then
since
we
all
love
the
same
lady
that
ought
to
bind
us
more
together
than
anything
else
has
ever
done
but
since
we
can
not
all
marry
her
let
us
agree
in
the
first
place
that
no
outsider
ever
shall
hurrah
said
arthur
i
could
see
that
he
was
fearfully
excited
throwing
his
glass
into
the
fireplace
with
a
crash
i
am
with
you
pat
i
cried
it
to
be
one
of
us
three
and
we
are
in
league
against
all
the
other
men
in
london
and
now
the
question
is
hear
my
plan
this
very
night
we
draw
lots
as
to
which
of
us
shall
have
the
first
chance
the
man
who
wins
shall
have
the
entire
support
of
the
other
two
in
every
possible
way
if
she
accepts
him
then
the
fates
have
spoken
if
she
does
then
the
next
man
in
the
draw
shall
have
his
chance
and
the
rejected
suitor
and
the
poor
third
man
shall
help
to
the
utmost
of
their
ability
is
that
clear
he
stopped
and
looked
down
at
us
from
his
great
height
with
a
smiling
and
anxious
face
dear
old
pat
i
shall
always
love
to
think
that
the
proposal
came
from
him
straight
clean
and
true
as
he
always
was
so
be
it
arthur
echoed
solemnly
the
league
shall
begin
this
very
night
do
either
of
you
chaps
know
any
spanish
by
the
way
we
shook
our
heads
well
i
do
he
continued
and
we
form
ourselves
into
a
santa
hermandad
holy
brotherhood
it
was
the
name
of
an
old
spanish
society
of
chivalry
ever
so
many
years
ago
santa
hermandad
pat
shouted
and
now
to
shake
hands
on
it
i
think
we
not
be
needing
to
take
an
oath
our
three
hands
were
clasped
together
in
an
instant
and
we
knew
that
come
what
might
each
would
be
true
to
that
bond
and
now
i
said
to
draw
lots
as
to
who
shall
be
the
first
to
try
his
chance
how
shall
we
settle
it
there
no
fairer
way
said
arthur
than
the
throw
of
a
die
have
you
any
poker
dice
tom
yes
i
have
a
couple
of
sets
somewhere
very
well
then
we
take
a
single
one
and
the
first
man
that
throws
queen
is
the
winner
i
found
the
dice
and
the
leather
cup
and
dropped
a
single
one
into
it
poker
dice
for
the
benefit
of
the
uninitiate
have
the
queen
on
one
side
in
blue
like
the
queen
in
a
pack
of
cards
the
king
in
red
and
the
knave
in
black
on
two
other
faces
the
nine
and
the
ten
who
will
throw
first
said
pat
you
throw
i
said
there
was
a
rattle
and
nine
fell
upon
the
table
i
nodded
to
arthur
who
picked
up
the
little
ivory
square
waved
the
cup
in
the
air
and
threw
an
ace
my
turn
came
i
threw
an
ace
also
and
arthur
and
i
looked
at
pat
with
sinking
hearts
he
threw
a
king
i
do
want
another
five
minutes
like
that
again
we
threw
and
threw
and
threw
and
never
once
did
the
queen
turn
up
at
last
arthur
said
look
here
you
fellows
i
ca
stand
this
much
longer
it
playing
the
devil
with
my
nerves
let
have
one
more
throw
and
if
her
majesty
does
turn
up
let
decide
it
by
values
ace
highest
king
queen
and
so
on
tom
your
turn
i
took
up
the
box
rattled
the
cube
within
it
for
a
long
time
and
then
dropped
it
flat
upon
the
table
i
had
thrown
queen
chapter
two
about
a
fortnight
after
the
memorable
scene
in
my
flat
when
the
league
came
into
being
i
was
sitting
in
my
editorial
room
at
the
offices
of
the
i
had
met
juanita
once
at
a
large
dinner
party
and
exchanged
half
a
dozen
words
with
her
that
was
all
my
head
was
full
of
plans
i
was
trying
to
map
out
a
social
campaign
that
would
give
me
the
opportunity
i
longed
for
but
as
yet
everything
was
tentative
and
incomplete
the
exciting
business
of
journalism
the
keeping
of
one
thumb
upon
the
public
pulse
the
directing
of
public
thought
into
this
or
that
channel
was
most
welcome
at
a
time
like
this
and
i
threw
myself
into
it
with
avidity
i
had
just
returned
from
lunch
and
the
first
editions
of
the
paper
were
successfully
afloat
when
williams
my
acting
editor
and
miss
dewsbury
my
private
secretary
came
into
my
room
things
are
very
quiet
indeed
said
williams
but
the
circulation
is
all
right
never
better
still
i
am
thinking
of
our
reputation
sir
thomas
i
knew
what
he
meant
we
had
never
allowed
the
highly
successful
as
it
was
to
go
on
in
a
fashion
we
had
a
tremendous
reputation
for
great
stunts
genuine
exclusive
pieces
of
news
and
now
for
weeks
nothing
particular
had
come
our
way
that
all
very
well
williams
but
we
can
not
make
bricks
without
straw
and
if
everything
is
as
stagnant
as
a
duck
pond
that
not
our
fault
miss
dewsbury
broke
in
she
was
a
little
woman
of
thirty
with
a
large
head
fair
hair
drawn
tightly
from
a
rather
prominent
brow
and
wore
spectacles
she
looked
as
if
her
clothes
had
been
flung
at
her
and
had
stuck
but
for
all
that
julia
dewsbury
was
the
best
private
secretary
in
london
true
as
steel
with
an
inordinate
capacity
for
work
and
an
immense
love
for
the
paper
i
think
she
liked
me
a
little
too
and
she
was
well
worth
the
four
hundred
a
year
i
paid
her
i
said
miss
dewsbury
live
at
richmond
both
williams
and
i
cocked
our
ears
julia
never
wasted
words
but
she
liked
to
tell
her
story
her
own
way
and
it
was
best
to
let
her
do
so
ah
said
williams
appreciatively
and
i
believe
she
went
on
that
one
of
the
biggest
newspaper
stories
ever
is
going
to
come
from
richmond
it
is
something
that
will
go
round
the
world
if
i
am
not
very
much
mistaken
and
we
got
to
have
it
first
sir
thomas
williams
gave
a
low
whistle
and
i
strained
at
the
leash
so
to
speak
i
refer
miss
dewsbury
went
on
to
the
great
wireless
erections
on
richmond
hill
for
a
moment
i
felt
disappointed
i
did
see
how
interest
could
be
revived
in
that
matter
and
i
said
so
nearly
a
year
ago
i
remarked
every
paper
in
england
was
booming
with
it
we
did
our
share
i
sure
no
one
could
have
protested
more
vigorously
and
it
was
the
that
got
all
those
questions
asked
in
parliament
but
surely
miss
dewsbury
it
dead
as
mutton
now
an
accepted
fact
and
the
public
have
got
used
to
it
there
nothing
said
williams
more
impossible
than
to
reanimate
a
dead
bit
of
news
it
been
tried
over
and
over
again
and
it
never
been
a
real
success
miss
dewsbury
smiled
the
smile
that
means
when
you
poor
dear
silly
men
have
done
talking
then
you
shall
hear
something
i
saw
that
smile
and
took
courage
again
suppose
said
miss
dewsbury
that
we
just
look
up
the
facts
as
a
preliminary
to
what
i
have
to
say
she
went
to
a
side
table
on
which
was
a
dial
with
little
ivory
tablets
each
bearing
a
name
room
composing
room
williams
library
and
she
pulled
a
little
handle
over
the
last
disk
immediately
speaking
into
a
telephone
receiver
above
facts
relating
to
great
wireless
installment
on
richmond
hill
a
bell
whirred
and
she
came
back
to
the
table
where
we
were
sitting
in
twenty
seconds
so
perfect
was
our
organization
at
the
office
a
youth
entered
with
a
portfolio
containing
a
number
of
press
cuttings
photographs
etc
miss
dewsbury
opened
it
a
year
ago
she
said
the
real
estate
market
was
greatly
interested
to
learn
that
flight
jones
rutley
the
agents
had
secured
several
acres
of
property
on
the
top
of
richmond
hill
the
buyer
name
was
not
discovered
but
an
enormously
wealthy
syndicate
was
suggested
at
that
time
opportunely
chosen
many
leases
had
fallen
in
others
that
had
some
time
still
to
run
were
bought
at
a
greatly
enhanced
value
while
several
portions
of
freehold
property
were
also
purchased
at
ten
times
their
worth
houses
immediately
began
to
be
demolished
immense
compensation
was
paid
to
those
who
hung
out
and
refused
to
quit
the
newly
purchased
area
pressure
it
is
hinted
of
a
somewhat
unwarrantable
kind
was
also
applied
the
sum
involved
was
enormous
but
every
claim
was
cheerfully
settled
with
the
result
that
this
area
of
several
acres
was
entirely
denuded
of
buildings
and
surrounded
by
a
high
wall
in
an
incredibly
short
space
of
time
the
most
beautiful
view
in
england
spoiled
forever
said
williams
with
a
sigh
miss
dewsbury
turned
over
a
few
leaves
of
course
you
will
both
remember
the
agitation
that
went
on
the
opposition
of
the
local
and
county
councils
the
rage
of
societies
for
preserving
the
ancient
monuments
and
historic
places
of
interest
etc
the
newspapers
including
ours
took
up
the
matter
vigorously
then
with
a
curious
unanimity
all
opposition
began
to
die
away
it
is
quite
certain
that
huge
sums
were
spent
in
buying
over
the
objectors
though
no
actual
proof
was
ever
discovered
the
matter
was
altogether
too
delicate
a
thing
and
was
far
too
skillfully
worked
then
the
unknown
purchaser
began
to
build
the
three
great
towers
now
approaching
completion
an
army
of
workmen
was
gathered
together
in
a
new
industrial
city
between
brentford
and
hounslow
fleets
of
ships
bearing
steel
girders
and
so
forth
arrived
from
america
together
with
a
hundred
highly
trained
engineers
all
of
them
americans
it
was
given
out
that
the
most
powerful
wireless
station
in
the
whole
world
was
to
be
constructed
again
much
opposition
appeals
to
the
government
questions
to
the
board
of
trade
and
so
forth
i
remember
that
very
much
the
same
sort
of
thing
happened
in
paris
when
the
eiffel
tower
was
first
constructed
england
agitation
was
opposed
by
the
scientific
bodies
of
the
day
and
there
were
other
forces
behind
which
brought
pressure
to
bear
on
the
government
that
also
is
certain
though
nothing
has
actually
transpired
as
yet
in
this
regard
now
we
three
monstrous
towers
of
nearly
two
thousand
feet
in
twice
the
height
of
the
eiffel
dominating
london
every
day
almost
we
who
live
in
richmond
and
the
surrounding
towns
see
these
monsters
shooting
up
higher
into
the
air
often
half
of
them
is
veiled
by
clouds
the
most
tremendous
engineering
feat
in
the
history
of
the
world
is
nearly
accomplished
now
all
this
was
quite
familiar
to
me
and
in
common
with
many
londoners
i
had
begun
to
take
a
sort
of
lazy
pride
in
the
gaunt
of
steel
which
seemed
climbing
to
heaven
itself
all
the
same
i
saw
no
great
journalistic
opportunity
and
i
said
so
let
us
consider
a
little
continued
the
imperturbable
julia
these
towers
are
government
owned
they
are
the
property
of
some
private
syndicate
the
secret
has
been
kept
with
extraordinary
success
all
the
marconi
shareholders
of
the
city
all
the
big
financial
corporations
even
foreign
governments
have
been
trying
to
get
at
the
root
of
the
matter
each
and
all
have
utterly
failed
yet
our
own
government
knows
and
sooner
or
later
a
pronouncement
will
have
to
be
made
if
we
could
anticipate
this
then
the
interest
of
the
public
would
rise
to
fever
heat
again
and
we
should
have
a
scoop
of
the
first
magnitude
i
saw
that
immediately
and
so
did
williams
but
as
it
was
obvious
miss
dewsbury
had
quite
finished
we
just
nodded
and
let
her
go
on
now
i
have
reason
for
thinking
she
said
and
i
am
not
speaking
lightly
sir
thomas
that
there
something
behind
this
affair
of
a
totally
unexpected
and
startling
nature
some
day
no
doubt
the
towers
will
be
used
for
scientific
purposes
but
there
a
deep
mystery
surrounding
everything
and
one
very
different
from
what
we
might
suppose
i
think
we
can
penetrate
it
splendid
i
cried
for
i
knew
very
well
that
julia
dewsbury
would
not
say
as
much
as
she
had
unless
there
was
certainty
behind
her
words
and
how
do
you
propose
to
start
work
as
i
was
looking
at
her
she
flushed
and
i
nearly
fell
off
my
chair
it
had
never
occurred
to
me
that
miss
dewsbury
could
blush
in
fact
that
she
was
human
at
all
i
am
afraid
and
i
wondered
what
on
earth
was
the
matter
may
i
make
a
little
personal
explanation
sir
thomas
she
said
i
live
in
a
quiet
street
at
the
foot
of
richmond
hill
where
i
occupy
a
large
and
comfortable
room
in
number
acacia
road
the
house
is
kept
by
an
excellent
woman
who
only
takes
in
one
other
lodger
you
pay
me
a
very
handsome
salary
sir
thomas
and
i
might
be
expected
to
live
in
a
more
commodious
way
a
flat
in
kensington
or
something
like
that
but
i
have
other
claims
upon
me
there
are
two
young
sisters
and
a
brother
to
be
educated
and
i
am
their
sole
support
that
why
i
live
in
a
small
lodging
house
at
richmond
which
again
is
the
reason
that
i
have
recently
come
into
contact
with
some
one
who
may
be
of
inestimable
value
to
the
paper
she
blushed
again
upon
my
soul
she
did
and
i
heard
williams
gasp
in
astonishment
i
kicked
him
under
the
table
the
other
room
at
has
recently
been
occupied
by
a
young
man
perhaps
i
should
rather
say
a
youth
william
rolston
he
seemed
very
lonely
and
quite
poor
and
on
discussing
him
with
my
landlady
she
informed
me
that
she
more
than
suspected
that
he
had
at
times
to
economize
grievously
in
the
matter
of
food
i
myself
used
to
hear
the
click
of
a
typewriter
across
the
passage
sometimes
continuing
till
late
at
night
and
from
the
frequency
with
which
bulky
envelopes
arrived
for
him
by
post
it
was
easy
to
deduce
that
he
was
an
unsuccessful
author
or
journalist
this
naturally
excited
my
interest
has
no
idea
that
i
am
connected
with
the
she
thinks
i
am
typist
in
a
city
firm
of
hardware
merchants
and
when
i
made
my
acquaintance
with
rolston
as
i
did
some
time
ago
owing
to
his
back
number
remington
going
wrong
i
told
him
nothing
but
that
i
myself
was
a
typist
and
stenographer
i
was
enabled
to
put
his
machine
right
and
we
became
friends
am
i
boring
you
sir
thomas
and
mr
williams
she
said
suddenly
with
a
quick
look
at
both
of
us
on
the
contrary
i
replied
you
are
paying
us
a
great
compliment
miss
dewsbury
in
allowing
us
to
know
something
of
your
own
private
affairs
in
order
that
you
may
explain
how
you
propose
to
do
the
paper
a
signal
service
i
can
swear
that
the
little
woman
eyes
grew
bright
behind
her
spectacles
and
she
went
on
with
renewed
confidence
of
manner
i
have
been
associated
with
journalism
for
eight
years
now
she
said
during
that
time
innumerable
journalists
have
passed
before
me
in
my
own
way
i
have
studied
them
all
and
i
believe
i
can
detect
the
real
journalist
almost
as
well
as
williams
can
a
good
deal
better
i
should
think
said
the
acting
editor
considering
the
people
i
have
trusted
and
the
mistakes
i
have
sometimes
made
at
any
rate
i
can
say
with
my
whole
heart
that
bill
i
mean
rolston
though
he
is
only
and
has
never
had
a
chance
in
his
life
yet
has
the
makings
in
him
of
the
most
successful
journalist
of
the
day
he
will
rise
to
the
very
top
of
the
tree
but
as
we
all
know
though
great
merit
will
come
to
the
surface
in
time
chance
is
a
great
element
in
retarding
or
accelerating
the
process
i
think
that
rolston
chance
has
come
now
you
mean
i
asked
that
this
boy
utterly
unknown
with
hardly
a
left
foot
in
fleet
street
as
yet
has
had
the
acumen
to
see
right
to
his
hand
one
of
the
greatest
journalistic
sensations
of
modern
times
i
refer
to
the
three
towers
on
richmond
hill
we
have
been
for
evening
strolls
together
and
the
boy
has
poured
out
his
whole
heart
to
me
as
he
might
to
a
mother
or
any
older
woman
and
here
poor
julia
blushed
again
and
i
thought
i
saw
her
lips
quiver
for
a
moment
the
day
before
yesterday
he
said
to
me
dewsbury
of
course
you
do
understand
anything
about
journalism
but
i
on
the
track
of
the
very
biggest
thing
you
could
possibly
imagine
i
have
been
lying
low
and
saying
nothing
i
hot
on
the
scent
he
hinted
at
what
it
was
without
giving
me
very
many
details
though
these
were
quite
sufficient
to
show
me
that
he
was
making
no
idle
boast
then
he
said
what
use
is
it
if
i
went
with
what
i
got
already
to
any
of
the
papers
i
might
or
might
not
get
to
see
some
unimaginative
who
squash
me
into
a
cocked
hat
in
five
minutes
that
the
worst
of
being
absolutely
unknown
and
without
any
pull
if
only
i
could
get
to
see
a
real
editor
of
one
of
the
big
papers
a
man
who
would
give
me
a
patient
hearing
a
man
with
imagination
i
would
engage
to
convince
him
in
ten
minutes
and
my
fortune
would
be
made
she
stopped
leant
back
in
her
chair
and
looked
at
me
inquiringly
good
heavens
i
cried
have
him
up
i
am
quite
certain
that
you
could
never
have
been
deceived
miss
dewsbury
you
have
not
been
with
me
for
four
years
without
my
knowing
how
valuable
your
intuition
is
send
him
to
me
at
once
miss
dewsbury
gave
a
dry
gratified
chuckle
i
may
have
stretched
things
a
little
far
in
having
too
much
confidence
in
my
position
here
she
said
but
i
was
determined
to
gamble
on
it
and
i
won
this
morning
before
i
left
for
the
office
i
gave
a
little
note
for
bill
he
has
an
unfortunate
habit
of
lying
in
bed
in
the
morning
the
note
told
him
that
by
an
odd
coincidence
i
thought
i
might
put
him
in
the
way
of
writing
an
article
for
the
and
that
he
was
to
be
in
the
café
at
the
corner
by
three
precisely
she
looked
at
her
it
five
minutes
to
now
i
will
send
for
him
at
once
rolston
did
you
say
the
name
was
miss
dewsbury
said
williams
yes
rolston
but
the
messenger
ca
mistake
him
he
about
five
feet
two
high
very
slim
with
an
innocent
baby
face
and
very
dark
red
hair
oh
and
his
ears
stick
out
at
the
sides
of
his
head
almost
at
right
angles
please
say
nothing
about
my
part
in
the
matter
as
yet
at
any
rate
miss
dewsbury
asked
as
she
went
away
and
some
minutes
afterwards
a
page
boy
ushered
in
one
of
the
most
curious
little
figures
i
have
ever
seen
rolston
was
short
slim
and
well
proportioned
he
looked
active
as
a
monkey
and
tough
as
whipcord
he
was
rather
shabbily
dressed
in
an
old
blue
suit
his
face
was
childish
only
in
contour
and
complexion
and
for
the
rest
he
could
have
sat
as
a
model
for
puck
to
any
painter
there
was
something
impish
and
merry
in
his
rather
slanting
eyes
and
his
button
of
a
mouth
was
capable
of
some
very
surprising
contortions
his
ears
like
the
ears
of
a
mouse
stood
out
on
each
side
of
his
head
and
completed
the
elfish
impression
sit
down
rolston
i
said
pointing
to
a
chair
on
the
other
side
of
the
table
the
little
man
bowed
very
low
and
slid
into
the
chair
i
had
an
odd
impression
that
he
would
shortly
produce
a
nut
and
begin
to
crack
it
with
his
teeth
i
could
see
that
he
was
in
a
whirl
of
amazement
and
at
the
same
time
horribly
nervous
and
i
tried
to
put
him
at
his
ease
i
understand
i
said
that
you
are
a
journalist
mr
rolston
yes
sir
thomas
he
replied
in
a
cultivated
voice
though
with
a
curious
guttural
note
in
it
and
i
marked
that
he
knew
my
name
i
also
understand
never
mind
how
that
for
some
time
past
you
have
been
wishing
to
see
the
editor
of
a
large
london
daily
to
penetrate
right
to
the
fountain
head
so
to
speak
well
here
you
are
i
am
the
editor
of
the
what
have
you
to
propose
to
me
i
passed
a
box
of
cigarettes
over
the
table
towards
him
but
he
shook
his
head
it
about
the
three
great
towers
now
approaching
completion
at
richmond
you
have
some
special
information
some
very
startling
information
indeed
sir
thomas
an
idea
came
to
me
some
months
ago
i
thought
it
worth
while
testing
and
it
proved
trumps
if
you
have
anything
in
the
nature
of
a
scoop
rolston
i
need
hardly
say
that
it
will
be
very
well
worth
your
while
if
when
i
have
heard
what
you
have
to
say
i
can
not
use
your
information
i
will
give
you
my
personal
word
that
all
you
tell
me
shall
be
kept
an
entire
secret
that
good
enough
for
any
one
he
answered
with
a
sudden
grin
well
sir
these
towers
will
eventually
lapse
to
the
british
government
as
a
gift
from
the
private
individual
who
has
erected
them
but
they
will
remain
his
property
and
be
used
for
his
own
purposes
until
his
death
and
these
purposes
are
not
wireless
telegraphy
or
even
scientific
in
any
shape
or
form
indeed
wireless
telegraphy
is
expressly
forbidden
well
at
that
i
sat
upright
in
my
chair
here
was
news
indeed
if
it
were
true
that
big
stuff
i
replied
at
once
if
you
can
substantiate
it
i
think
you
will
believe
me
when
i
have
finished
he
replied
quietly
i
have
risked
my
life
more
than
once
to
get
at
the
facts
my
father
sir
thomas
was
a
missionary
in
china
i
was
brought
up
to
speak
the
chinese
language
as
well
as
english
i
am
one
of
the
very
few
europeans
who
do
so
fluently
moreover
i
kept
it
up
till
i
was
sixteen
and
came
to
england
and
i
have
never
forgotten
it
you
have
heard
i
suppose
that
there
a
gang
of
chinese
coolies
at
work
on
the
towers
and
some
of
the
trade
unions
have
been
making
themselves
nasty
about
it
and
the
american
labor
yes
there
was
some
agitation
in
addition
to
these
coolies
there
are
many
chinese
officials
of
a
much
higher
class
people
who
will
remain
when
the
towers
are
finished
as
they
will
be
in
an
incredibly
short
space
of
time
for
the
work
is
being
carried
on
both
by
day
and
night
speed
speed
speed
is
the
order
and
nothing
in
the
world
is
allowed
to
stand
in
the
way
of
it
you
interest
me
very
much
please
continue
speaking
chinese
as
i
do
being
perfectly
familiar
with
chinese
dress
and
customs
it
has
not
been
difficult
for
me
to
disguise
myself
blacken
my
hair
assume
a
yellow
complexion
and
so
forth
by
this
means
i
have
penetrated
to
the
very
heart
of
the
workings
at
night
and
he
blushed
faintly
i
have
listened
to
conversations
of
an
extraordinary
character
lying
on
the
roof
of
a
certain
office
building
for
hours
details
you
shall
have
and
in
plenty
but
here
is
the
sum
of
my
discoveries
there
is
no
syndicate
there
never
was
the
work
upon
which
millions
have
been
spent
has
been
from
the
very
first
designed
and
originated
by
one
individual
with
the
specialized
help
of
the
most
famous
engineers
of
america
and
his
motive
i
asked
and
i
do
mind
saying
that
i
was
almost
trembling
with
excitement
the
dream
of
a
genius
or
the
whim
of
a
madman
rolston
answered
in
a
grave
voice
the
world
will
call
it
one
or
the
other
without
a
doubt
at
any
rate
it
the
product
of
a
colossal
imagination
for
myself
i
am
dead
certain
that
there
some
deeper
and
stranger
motive
beneath
it
all
but
that
can
rest
for
the
present
sir
thomas
between
those
three
great
towers
two
thousand
feet
up
in
the
air
will
very
shortly
come
into
being
a
fantastic
pleasure
city
like
a
dream
of
the
arabian
nights
it
will
be
unique
in
the
history
of
the
world
and
already
the
preparations
are
so
far
advanced
that
it
will
be
completed
with
extraordinary
rapidity
a
pleasure
city
i
gasped
a
pleasure
city
in
the
clouds
on
two
stages
right
up
at
the
very
summit
suspended
by
a
system
of
cantilevers
of
the
most
intricate
modern
construction
and
of
toughened
steel
i
understand
that
a
triangle
measuring
in
all
four
acres
will
support
a
marvelous
series
of
palaces
a
lhassa
of
the
air
why
lhassa
mr
rolston
because
he
replied
it
to
be
a
forbidden
city
which
no
one
will
be
allowed
to
penetrate
or
see
it
is
a
marvelous
conception
only
possible
to
enormous
wealth
and
the
vision
of
a
superman
i
left
my
chair
and
began
pacing
up
and
down
the
room
as
the
freakish
grandeur
of
the
conception
burst
fully
upon
me
towering
over
london
dwarfing
saint
paul
to
a
child
toy
a
city
in
the
clouds
i
stopped
suddenly
wheeled
round
and
shouted
but
who
rolston
is
the
madman
genius
or
superman
who
has
imagined
this
and
actually
carried
it
out
in
sober
england
that
the
greatest
secret
of
all
he
said
looking
round
the
room
as
if
frightened
then
he
slid
from
his
chair
and
was
at
my
side
in
a
moment
it
a
gideon
mendoza
morse
from
brazil
he
whispered
chapter
three
rolston
revelation
utterly
unexpected
came
to
me
with
the
suddenness
of
a
blow
over
the
heart
for
a
few
seconds
i
was
incapable
of
consecutive
thought
though
i
do
think
my
face
showed
anything
of
it
the
lad
was
watching
me
anxiously
and
i
had
to
do
something
with
him
at
once
fortunately
i
thought
of
the
obvious
thing
leave
me
now
rolston
i
said
go
to
the
room
down
the
passage
marked
williams
on
the
door
and
ask
him
to
put
you
into
a
room
by
yourself
then
please
as
quickly
as
possible
write
me
out
a
newspaper
setting
out
fully
all
the
facts
you
have
told
me
remember
that
you
got
to
interest
the
public
in
the
very
first
paragraph
in
what
is
undoubtedly
a
most
sensational
piece
of
news
how
many
words
sir
he
asked
me
i
liked
that
it
was
professional
a
thousand
and
when
you
done
that
bring
it
straight
in
to
me
he
was
out
of
the
room
in
a
minute
and
i
sat
down
to
think
in
the
first
place
i
did
doubt
his
story
for
a
moment
there
was
something
transparently
honest
about
the
boy
and
unless
i
was
very
much
mistaken
there
was
great
ability
in
him
also
when
there
was
time
for
it
i
expected
i
should
hear
a
breathless
story
of
his
adventures
in
the
search
of
this
stuff
he
had
hinted
that
his
life
had
been
in
danger
i
began
to
think
hard
assuming
that
was
true
that
morse
had
been
seized
with
this
extraordinary
whim
how
did
i
stand
in
the
matter
at
a
first
view
it
appeared
that
i
was
rather
badly
snookered
morse
always
assuming
young
rolston
was
correct
had
spent
a
huge
fortune
in
keeping
his
secret
moreover
the
government
was
in
it
with
him
it
would
hardly
be
the
way
to
recommend
myself
to
father
whose
good
opinion
i
desired
to
gain
more
than
that
of
any
other
person
in
the
world
save
one
by
giving
his
cherished
secret
to
the
world
in
order
to
increase
the
prestige
and
circulation
of
the
if
i
did
publish
it
it
was
odds
on
that
i
never
saw
juanita
again
one
thing
occurred
to
me
with
relief
it
was
a
case
in
which
i
to
publish
in
the
public
interest
by
suppressing
news
i
was
not
failing
my
duty
as
an
editor
only
losing
a
big
scoop
though
that
was
hard
enough
what
was
to
be
done
as
i
asked
myself
that
question
i
confess
that
for
a
brief
moment
thank
heaven
it
did
not
last
long
it
occurred
to
me
that
i
was
now
in
a
position
to
put
considerable
pressure
upon
the
millionaire
i
could
hold
out
inducements
fortunately
i
crushed
all
such
ugly
thoughts
without
much
effort
and
then
the
real
solution
came
when
i
had
questioned
rolston
a
little
more
and
was
bedrock
certain
that
he
was
right
i
would
see
morse
at
once
and
tell
him
all
i
had
learnt
without
reserve
i
would
present
the
thing
to
him
as
one
in
which
i
claimed
no
personal
interest
and
my
attitude
would
be
that
i
felt
he
ought
to
be
warned
i
would
engage
to
publish
nothing
without
his
wish
but
he
must
look
to
it
if
he
wished
to
preserve
his
secret
that
other
people
were
not
upon
the
same
track
that
could
do
me
no
harm
whatever
it
was
the
straight
thing
to
do
and
at
the
same
time
it
would
certainly
help
me
with
him
i
thought
and
think
still
that
this
was
a
fair
advantage
to
take
it
is
only
a
fool
who
throws
away
a
legitimate
weapon
in
love
or
war
i
rang
up
the
ritz
hotel
and
asked
for
morse
there
was
some
little
delay
at
the
hotel
bureau
and
then
i
was
switched
on
to
the
telephone
of
the
private
apartments
who
that
asked
a
cold
characterless
voice
sir
thomas
kirby
of
the
speaking
who
are
you
secretary
to
morse
now
the
voice
was
a
little
warmer
is
morse
at
home
i
can
see
that
he
gets
a
message
very
shortly
sir
thomas
if
the
matter
is
of
importance
it
is
of
very
considerable
importance
or
i
should
have
troubled
to
ring
morse
up
especially
as
i
shall
be
meeting
him
in
a
day
or
two
at
a
social
engagement
wait
a
moment
please
i
knew
by
this
that
i
had
struck
lucky
and
that
morse
was
in
the
hotel
and
within
a
minute
i
heard
his
calm
resonant
voice
in
my
ear
good
afternoon
kirby
my
secretary
says
you
wanted
to
speak
to
me
thank
you
i
am
most
anxious
to
have
a
conversation
well
shall
we
hold
the
wire
i
dare
discuss
my
business
over
the
wire
mr
morse
there
was
a
short
silence
and
then
please
forgive
me
but
you
know
how
busy
i
am
could
you
give
me
the
least
indication
of
what
you
wish
to
talk
to
me
about
i
had
an
inspiration
towers
i
said
in
a
low
voice
a
quiet
ah
came
to
me
over
the
wire
and
then
i
think
i
understand
sir
thomas
you
wish
to
tell
you
something
that
i
feel
sure
you
ought
to
know
in
your
own
interests
pass
was
the
reply
followed
by
a
little
chuckle
in
which
i
thought
i
might
have
been
mistaken
i
detected
a
note
of
relief
when
shall
we
meet
i
asked
look
here
kirby
was
the
reply
can
you
come
here
at
eleven
i
give
orders
that
you
are
to
be
taken
up
to
my
rooms
at
once
i
ca
guarantee
that
i
shall
be
in
at
the
moment
i
also
have
something
of
considerable
importance
on
hand
but
if
you
will
wait
afraid
i
asking
a
great
deal
i
be
certain
to
be
with
you
sooner
or
later
my
daughter
may
be
at
home
and
if
she
is
no
doubt
she
give
you
a
cup
of
coffee
or
something
while
you
wait
do
you
think
you
can
manage
this
i
shall
be
delighted
i
answered
trying
to
control
my
voice
and
i
hardly
heard
the
quiet
that
concluded
our
conversation
well
i
had
done
better
for
myself
than
i
had
hoped
and
so
vain
are
all
of
us
i
felt
a
kind
of
satisfaction
in
having
played
the
game
and
at
the
same
time
won
the
trick
i
did
not
reflect
till
afterwards
that
if
morse
had
been
some
one
else
and
not
the
father
of
juanita
i
should
not
have
hesitated
for
a
moment
to
fill
the
with
scare
headlines
i
sat
down
again
in
my
chair
ordered
a
cup
of
tea
drank
it
with
splendid
visions
of
a
with
juanita
that
very
night
and
was
leaning
back
in
my
chair
lost
in
a
rosy
dream
when
the
door
opened
and
the
odd
little
man
with
the
red
hair
appeared
at
my
side
holding
two
or
three
sheets
of
typewritten
copy
the
story
sir
he
said
i
took
it
from
him
mechanically
it
would
never
be
published
now
in
all
probability
but
it
would
at
least
serve
to
show
morse
how
much
i
knew
i
began
to
read
at
the
end
of
the
first
paragraph
i
knew
that
the
stuff
was
going
to
be
all
right
at
the
end
of
the
second
and
third
i
sat
up
in
my
chair
and
abandoned
my
easy
attitude
when
i
had
read
the
whole
of
the
thousand
words
i
knew
that
i
had
discovered
one
of
the
best
journalistic
brains
of
the
day
the
boy
could
not
only
ferret
out
news
but
he
could
every
word
fell
with
the
right
ring
and
chimed
he
was
terse
but
vivid
as
an
alpine
sunset
he
made
one
powerful
word
do
the
work
of
ten
he
suggested
atmosphere
by
a
semicolon
and
there
were
fewer
adjectives
in
his
stuff
than
one
would
have
believed
possible
there
were
not
four
other
men
in
fleet
street
who
could
have
done
as
well
and
beyond
this
beyond
my
pleasure
at
the
discovery
of
a
genius
the
article
had
a
peculiar
effect
upon
me
i
felt
that
somehow
or
other
the
matter
was
not
going
to
die
with
my
interview
at
the
ritz
hotel
the
room
in
which
i
sat
widened
there
was
a
glimpse
of
far
horizons
i
folded
the
copy
carefully
and
placed
it
in
my
breast
pocket
rolston
i
said
i
engage
you
from
this
moment
as
a
member
of
my
regular
staff
your
salary
to
begin
with
will
be
ten
pounds
a
week
and
of
course
your
expenses
that
you
may
incur
in
the
course
of
your
work
do
you
accept
these
terms
poor
bill
rolston
i
must
give
away
the
man
who
afterwards
became
my
most
faithful
friend
and
most
daring
companion
in
hours
of
frightful
peril
and
a
series
of
incredible
adventures
still
if
he
burst
into
tears
that
nothing
against
him
for
i
did
realize
till
sometime
afterwards
that
he
was
half
starved
and
at
the
very
end
of
his
tether
he
pulled
himself
together
in
a
moment
or
two
took
a
cup
of
tea
and
let
me
him
what
he
told
me
in
the
next
i
can
not
set
down
here
it
will
appear
in
its
proper
place
but
it
is
enough
to
say
that
in
the
whole
of
my
experience
i
never
listened
to
a
more
mysterious
and
more
enthralling
recital
i
think
that
from
that
moment
i
realized
that
my
fate
was
to
be
in
some
way
linked
with
the
three
towers
on
richmond
hill
and
the
sense
of
excitement
which
had
been
with
me
all
the
afternoon
grew
till
it
was
almost
unbearable
now
first
of
all
i
said
when
he
had
told
me
everything
you
are
not
to
breathe
a
word
of
this
to
any
human
soul
without
my
permission
while
you
have
been
absent
i
have
already
been
taking
steps
the
nature
of
which
i
shall
not
tell
you
at
present
meanwhile
lock
up
everything
in
your
heart
i
had
a
flash
of
foresight
well
justified
in
the
event
i
may
want
you
at
any
moment
i
told
him
and
therefore
with
your
permission
i
going
to
put
you
up
at
my
flat
in
piccadilly
where
you
will
be
well
looked
after
and
have
everything
you
want
i
telephone
through
to
my
man
preston
giving
him
full
instructions
and
you
had
better
take
a
taxi
and
get
there
at
once
preston
will
send
a
messenger
to
your
lodgings
to
bring
up
any
clothes
and
so
forth
you
may
require
he
blushed
rosy
red
and
i
wondered
why
for
his
story
had
been
told
to
me
in
a
crisp
manner
that
made
him
seem
far
older
than
he
was
then
he
shrugged
his
shoulders
put
his
hand
in
his
trousers
pocket
and
pulled
out
one
penny
all
i
have
in
the
world
he
said
with
a
rueful
smile
i
scribbled
an
order
on
the
cashier
and
told
him
to
cash
it
in
the
office
below
and
with
a
look
of
almost
doglike
fidelity
and
gratitude
the
little
fellow
moved
towards
the
door
just
at
that
moment
it
opened
and
julia
dewsbury
came
in
rolston
jaw
dropped
and
his
eyes
almost
started
out
of
his
head
in
amazement
and
i
saw
a
look
come
into
my
secretary
eyes
that
i
should
have
been
glad
to
inspire
in
the
eyes
of
one
woman
there
there
i
said
be
off
with
you
both
of
you
miss
dewsbury
take
rolston
now
a
permanent
member
of
the
staff
into
your
own
room
and
tell
him
something
about
the
ways
of
the
office
for
half
an
hour
i
walked
up
and
down
the
editorial
sanctum
arranging
my
thoughts
getting
everything
clear
cut
and
when
that
was
done
i
telephoned
to
arthur
winstanley
asking
him
if
he
had
nothing
particular
on
to
dine
with
me
his
reply
was
that
he
would
be
delighted
as
he
had
nothing
to
do
till
eleven
but
that
i
must
dine
with
him
i
have
discovered
a
delightful
little
restaurant
he
said
which
is
fashionable
yet
though
it
soon
will
be
do
dress
and
meet
me
at
the
club
at
seven
my
dinner
with
arthur
can
be
related
very
shortly
for
while
it
has
distinct
bearing
upon
the
story
it
was
only
remarkable
for
one
incident
though
heaven
knows
that
was
important
enough
i
met
him
at
our
club
in
saint
james
and
we
walked
together
towards
soho
you
are
going
to
dine
said
arthur
at
the
golden
snail
it
a
new
departure
in
soho
restaurants
and
only
a
few
of
us
know
of
it
yet
soon
all
the
world
will
be
going
there
for
the
cooking
is
magnificent
that
always
the
way
with
these
soho
restaurants
they
begin
wonderfully
are
most
beautifully
select
in
their
patrons
and
then
the
rush
comes
and
everything
is
spoiled
i
know
the
same
will
happen
here
no
doubt
though
lower
bohemia
will
never
penetrate
because
the
prices
are
going
to
be
kept
up
and
this
place
will
always
equal
one
of
the
restaurants
in
town
well
how
goes
it
i
knew
what
he
meant
and
as
we
walked
i
told
him
as
in
duty
bound
all
there
was
to
tell
of
the
progress
of
my
suit
met
her
once
i
said
had
about
two
minutes
talk
there
just
a
chance
i
am
not
certain
that
i
may
meet
her
and
not
in
a
crowd
in
which
case
you
may
be
sure
i
shall
make
the
very
most
of
my
opportunities
if
this
does
come
off
i
do
see
any
other
chance
of
really
getting
to
know
her
until
september
at
sir
walter
stileman
and
i
have
to
thank
you
for
that
invitation
arthur
he
sighed
it
a
difficult
house
to
get
into
he
said
unless
you
are
one
of
the
pukka
shooting
set
but
i
told
old
sir
walter
that
though
you
were
much
good
in
october
and
that
pheasants
were
in
your
line
you
were
at
driven
but
i
ca
hit
a
driven
partridge
to
save
my
life
unless
by
a
fluke
i
know
tom
i
do
say
that
you
be
liked
at
all
but
you
won
the
toss
and
by
our
bond
we
bound
to
do
all
we
can
to
give
you
your
opportunity
i
need
hardly
say
that
my
greatest
hope
in
life
is
that
she
have
nothing
whatever
to
say
to
you
and
now
let
change
that
subject
it
confounded
thin
ice
however
you
look
at
it
and
enjoy
our
little
selves
i
have
been
on
the
with
anatole
and
we
are
going
to
my
son
really
the
golden
snail
in
a
soho
side
street
presented
no
great
front
to
the
world
there
was
a
sign
over
a
door
a
dingy
passage
to
be
traversed
until
one
came
to
another
door
opened
it
and
found
oneself
in
a
long
lofty
room
shaped
like
a
capital
the
long
arm
was
the
one
at
which
you
entered
the
other
went
round
a
rectangle
the
place
was
very
simply
decorated
in
black
and
white
tables
ran
along
each
side
and
the
only
difference
between
it
and
a
dozen
other
such
places
in
the
foreign
quarter
of
london
was
that
the
seats
against
the
wall
were
not
of
red
plush
but
of
dark
green
morocco
leather
it
was
fairly
full
of
a
mixed
company
but
and
impecunious
bohemia
was
conspicuously
absent
a
table
had
been
reserved
for
us
at
the
other
end
opposite
the
door
so
that
sitting
there
we
could
see
in
both
directions
we
started
with
little
tiny
oysters
from
belon
in
brittany
i
suppose
there
was
another
restaurant
in
london
at
that
moment
that
was
serving
them
the
soup
was
asparagus
cream
soup
of
superlative
excellence
and
then
came
a
young
stuffed
with
mushrooms
which
was
perfection
itself
how
on
earth
do
you
find
these
places
arthur
i
asked
well
he
answered
ever
since
i
left
oxford
i
been
going
about
london
and
paris
gathering
information
of
all
sorts
i
lived
among
the
queerest
set
of
people
in
europe
my
father
thinks
i
a
waster
but
he
does
know
my
mother
angel
that
she
is
understands
me
perfectly
she
knows
that
i
only
postponed
going
into
politics
until
i
have
had
more
experience
than
the
ordinary
young
man
in
my
position
gets
i
absolutely
refused
to
be
shoved
into
the
house
directly
i
had
come
down
with
my
degree
the
union
and
all
those
sort
of
blushing
honors
thick
upon
me
in
a
year
or
two
you
will
see
tom
and
meanwhile
here
the
moulin
à
vent
anatole
poured
out
that
delightful
but
little
known
burgundy
for
us
himself
and
it
was
a
wine
for
the
gods
a
little
interval
said
arthur
in
which
a
cigarette
is
clearly
indicated
and
then
we
are
to
have
some
slices
of
bear
ham
stewed
in
champagne
which
i
think
will
please
you
we
sat
and
smoked
looking
up
the
long
room
when
the
swing
doors
at
the
end
opened
and
a
man
and
a
girl
entered
they
came
down
towards
us
obviously
approaching
a
table
reserved
for
them
in
the
short
arm
of
the
restaurant
and
i
noticed
the
man
at
once
for
one
thing
he
was
in
full
evening
dress
whereas
the
only
other
diners
who
were
in
evening
kit
at
all
wore
dinner
jackets
and
black
ties
he
was
a
tall
man
of
about
fifty
with
wavy
gray
hair
his
face
was
clean
shaved
and
a
little
full
i
thought
i
had
never
seen
a
handsomer
man
or
one
who
moved
with
a
grace
and
ease
which
were
so
perfectly
unconscious
the
girl
beside
him
was
a
pretty
enough
young
creature
with
a
powdered
face
and
reddened
lips
nothing
about
her
in
the
least
out
of
the
ordinary
when
he
came
opposite
our
table
his
face
lighted
up
suddenly
he
smiled
at
arthur
and
opened
his
mouth
as
if
to
speak
arthur
looked
him
straight
in
the
face
with
a
calm
and
stony
stare
i
never
saw
a
more
cruel
or
explicit
cut
the
man
smiled
again
without
the
least
bravado
or
embarrassment
gave
an
almost
imperceptible
bow
and
passed
on
towards
his
table
without
any
one
but
ourselves
having
noticed
what
occurred
the
whole
affair
was
a
question
of
some
five
or
six
seconds
he
sat
down
with
his
back
to
us
who
is
he
i
asked
of
arthur
he
hesitated
for
a
moment
and
then
he
gave
a
little
shudder
of
disgust
i
thought
also
that
i
saw
a
shade
come
upon
his
face
no
one
you
are
ever
likely
to
meet
in
life
tom
he
replied
unless
you
go
to
see
him
tried
for
murder
at
the
old
bailey
some
day
he
is
a
fellow
called
mark
antony
midwinter
a
most
distinguished
looking
man
yes
and
i
should
say
he
stands
out
from
even
his
own
associates
in
a
preëminence
of
evil
tom
he
went
on
with
unusual
gravity
deep
down
in
the
soul
of
every
man
there
some
foul
primal
thing
some
troglodyte
that
by
the
mercy
of
god
never
awakes
in
most
of
us
but
when
it
does
in
some
and
dominates
them
then
a
man
becomes
a
fiend
lost
hopeless
irremediable
that
man
midwinter
is
such
an
one
you
could
not
find
his
like
in
europe
he
walks
among
his
fellows
with
a
panther
in
his
soul
and
the
high
imagination
the
artistic
power
in
him
makes
him
doubly
dangerous
i
could
tell
you
details
of
his
career
which
would
make
your
blood
run
cold
if
it
were
worth
while
it
is
but
i
perceive
our
bear
flesh
stewed
in
sillery
is
approaching
forget
this
intrusion
well
we
dined
after
the
fashion
of
sybaris
went
to
the
club
for
an
hour
and
smoked
and
then
arthur
returned
to
his
chambers
in
jermyn
street
to
dress
i
went
back
to
mine
found
from
preston
that
little
rolston
was
safely
in
bed
and
fast
asleep
changed
into
a
dinner
jacket
and
walked
the
few
yards
to
the
ritz
hotel
my
heart
beating
high
with
hope
i
was
shown
up
at
once
to
the
floor
inhabited
by
the
millionaire
and
knew
therefore
that
i
was
expected
the
man
who
conducted
me
knocked
at
a
door
opened
it
and
i
entered
i
found
myself
in
a
comfortable
room
with
writing
tables
and
desks
telephone
and
a
typewriter
a
young
man
of
two
or
three
and
twenty
was
seated
at
one
of
the
tables
smoking
a
cigarette
he
jumped
up
at
once
oh
sir
thomas
he
said
morse
has
not
yet
returned
and
i
think
it
quite
likely
he
may
be
some
little
time
but
the
señora
balmaceda
and
miss
morse
are
in
the
and
perhaps
you
would
like
to
i
shall
be
delighted
i
said
cutting
him
short
but
who
on
earth
was
señora
balmaceda
the
chaperone
i
supposed
confound
it
the
obliging
young
man
led
me
through
two
or
three
very
gorgeously
furnished
rooms
and
at
last
into
a
large
apartment
brilliantly
lit
from
the
roof
and
with
flowers
everywhere
at
one
end
was
a
little
alcove
i
have
brought
sir
thomas
señora
he
said
looking
about
the
room
but
there
was
no
one
remotely
resembling
a
señora
there
nevertheless
directly
he
spoke
some
one
stepped
out
of
the
conservatory
from
behind
a
tropical
shrub
in
a
green
tub
and
came
towards
us
it
was
juanita
and
she
was
alone
the
secretary
withdrew
and
i
advanced
to
meet
her
how
do
you
do
sir
thomas
she
said
in
her
beautiful
voice
father
said
you
might
be
coming
and
i
afraid
he
wo
be
in
just
yet
and
it
so
tiresome
poor
auntie
has
gone
to
bed
with
a
bad
headache
i
very
sorry
miss
morse
i
answered
as
we
shook
hands
i
must
do
what
i
can
to
take
her
place
and
then
i
looked
at
her
perfectly
straight
yes
i
dared
to
look
into
those
marvelous
limpid
eyes
and
i
know
she
saw
the
hunger
in
mine
for
she
took
her
hand
away
a
little
hurriedly
what
a
charming
room
is
that
a
little
conservatory
over
there
it
must
look
out
over
the
green
park
yes
it
does
she
replied
almost
in
a
whisper
then
do
let
sit
there
miss
morse
was
i
acting
in
a
play
or
what
on
earth
gave
me
this
sense
of
confidence
and
strength
heaven
only
knows
but
i
never
faltered
from
the
first
moment
that
i
entered
the
room
oh
the
gods
were
with
me
that
night
we
went
to
the
alcove
without
a
further
word
and
she
sat
down
upon
a
couch
i
have
described
her
once
at
lady
brentford
ball
but
at
this
moment
i
am
not
going
to
attempt
to
describe
her
at
all
for
half
a
minute
we
said
nothing
and
then
i
took
her
hand
and
pressed
it
to
my
lips
juanita
i
said
there
are
mysterious
currents
and
forces
in
this
world
stronger
than
we
are
ourselves
this
is
the
third
time
that
seen
you
but
no
power
on
earth
can
prevent
me
from
telling
you
she
was
looking
at
me
with
parted
lips
and
eyes
suffused
with
an
angelic
tenderness
and
modesty
my
voice
broke
in
my
throat
with
unutterable
joy
i
was
certain
that
she
loved
me
and
then
just
as
i
was
about
to
say
the
sealing
words
remember
i
had
invoked
the
gods
there
was
the
sound
of
a
door
opening
sharply
i
stiffened
and
rose
to
my
feet
from
where
we
sat
we
could
survey
the
whole
rich
room
through
the
open
door
i
must
say
there
were
several
doors
in
the
room
came
a
tall
man
he
was
in
full
evening
dress
with
a
camellia
in
his
he
stepped
back
lightly
with
steps
his
arms
a
little
curved
his
fingers
all
extended
i
saw
his
face
it
was
convulsed
with
the
satanic
fury
of
an
old
japanese
mask
line
for
line
it
was
just
like
that
and
it
was
also
the
face
of
the
bland
and
smiling
man
i
had
seen
two
hours
before
at
the
restaurant
of
the
golden
snail
i
felt
something
warm
and
trembling
at
my
side
juanita
was
clinging
to
me
and
i
put
my
arm
around
her
waist
through
the
open
door
there
now
came
another
figure
a
quiet
resonant
voice
cut
into
the
tense
horrible
silence
quick
mark
antony
midwinter
that
your
door
quick
quick
the
big
man
paused
for
an
instant
and
a
hissing
spitting
noise
came
from
his
mouth
there
was
a
sharp
crack
and
a
great
mirror
on
the
wall
shivered
in
pieces
there
was
another
and
then
the
big
man
turned
and
literally
bounded
over
the
soft
carpet
flung
himself
through
the
door
and
disappeared
gideon
mendoza
morse
advanced
into
the
smiling
to
himself
and
looking
down
at
a
little
automatic
in
his
hand
then
juanita
and
i
came
out
of
the
alcove
hand
in
hand
and
he
saw
us
chapter
four
gideon
morse
still
had
the
little
automatic
pistol
in
his
hand
he
was
actually
smiling
and
humming
a
little
tune
when
he
turned
and
saw
juanita
and
myself
coming
out
of
the
alcove
in
a
flash
his
hand
dropped
the
pistol
into
the
pocket
of
his
dinner
jacket
and
his
face
changed
santa
maria
he
said
in
spanish
and
then
juanita
sir
thomas
kirby
you
remember
you
gave
me
an
appointment
morse
i
stammered
of
course
of
course
then
he
said
no
more
for
with
a
little
gasp
juanita
sank
into
a
heap
upon
the
floor
we
had
loosened
hands
directly
the
millionaire
turned
towards
us
and
i
was
too
late
to
catch
her
morse
was
at
her
side
in
an
instant
the
bell
he
said
curtly
and
i
ran
to
the
side
of
the
room
and
pressed
the
button
hard
and
long
wow
but
these
money
emperors
of
the
world
are
well
served
in
a
second
so
it
seemed
the
room
was
full
of
people
the
young
secretary
a
couple
of
maids
a
dark
man
in
a
morning
coat
and
a
black
tie
whom
i
took
to
be
the
valet
and
finally
a
gigantic
fellow
in
tweeds
with
a
battered
face
as
big
as
a
ham
and
arms
which
reached
almost
to
his
knees
the
maids
were
at
the
girl
side
in
a
moment
applying
restoratives
morse
rose
just
as
another
door
opened
and
in
sailed
a
stout
elderly
lady
in
a
black
evening
dress
with
a
mantilla
of
black
lace
over
her
abundant
and
ivory
white
hair
morse
said
something
to
her
in
spanish
and
i
wished
i
had
been
arthur
winstanley
to
understand
it
then
i
felt
my
arm
taken
and
morse
drew
me
away
it
is
nothing
serious
he
said
just
a
little
shock
and
as
he
said
it
he
made
a
slight
gesture
with
his
head
it
was
enough
the
secretary
the
valet
and
the
huge
man
in
tweeds
faded
away
in
an
instant
though
not
before
i
had
seen
the
latter
spot
the
broken
mirror
and
a
ferocious
glint
come
into
his
eyes
nor
did
he
look
surprised
juanita
began
to
come
to
herself
and
she
was
tenderly
carried
away
by
the
women
morse
accompanied
them
and
spoke
in
a
rapid
whisper
to
the
distinguished
old
lady
who
i
knew
must
be
the
señora
balmaceda
the
two
of
us
were
left
alone
and
for
my
part
i
sank
down
in
an
adjacent
chair
quite
exhausted
in
mind
if
not
in
body
by
the
happenings
of
the
last
ten
minutes
up
to
the
present
i
will
say
nothing
of
the
future
i
had
never
lived
so
fast
or
so
much
in
such
a
short
space
of
time
and
you
got
to
get
accustomed
to
that
sort
of
thing
really
to
enjoy
it
i
afraid
your
visit
has
been
somewhat
exciting
said
my
host
in
his
musical
level
voice
his
eyes
were
as
dark
and
inscrutable
as
ever
but
nevertheless
i
saw
that
the
man
was
badly
moved
he
took
a
slim
gold
cigarette
case
from
his
waistcoat
pocket
and
his
hand
trembled
moreover
under
the
tan
of
his
skin
he
was
as
white
as
a
ghost
there
was
a
curious
gray
effect
i
laughed
i
confess
to
having
been
a
little
startled
your
secretary
brought
me
in
here
and
i
was
talking
to
miss
morse
in
the
conservatory
when
i
hesitated
for
a
moment
he
saved
me
the
trouble
of
going
on
i
guess
he
said
you
and
i
had
better
have
a
little
drink
now
and
he
went
to
the
wall
i
do
pretend
to
know
how
the
service
was
managed
i
suppose
there
was
a
somewhere
in
the
background
who
drilled
the
host
of
personal
and
hotel
attendances
who
ministered
to
the
wants
of
gideon
morse
at
any
rate
this
time
no
one
entered
but
one
of
the
hotel
footmen
and
he
brought
the
usual
tray
of
bottles
etc
morse
mixed
us
both
a
brandy
and
soda
and
i
noticed
two
things
first
his
hand
was
steady
again
secondly
the
brandy
was
not
decanted
but
came
out
of
a
bottle
on
which
was
the
of
ancient
royal
france
blown
into
the
glass
there
was
a
twinkle
in
his
eye
when
he
saw
i
had
spotted
that
yes
he
said
there
are
only
three
dozen
bottles
left
even
in
the
ritz
they
were
found
in
a
cellar
of
the
tuileries
and
he
tossed
off
his
glass
with
relish
so
did
i
cleopatra
pearls
were
not
so
expensive
now
look
here
sir
thomas
morse
said
sitting
down
by
me
and
drawing
up
his
chair
you
seen
something
of
a
very
unfortunate
nature
you
seen
it
quite
by
accident
if
news
of
it
got
about
if
it
were
even
whispered
through
a
certain
section
of
london
then
the
very
gravest
harm
might
result
not
only
to
me
but
to
many
other
persons
also
my
dear
sir
i
have
seen
nothing
i
have
heard
nothing
you
may
place
implicit
reliance
upon
that
and
i
held
out
my
hand
to
him
which
he
took
in
a
firm
grip
thank
you
sir
thomas
he
replied
simply
it
was
a
question
he
hesitated
for
the
fraction
of
a
second
and
i
knew
he
was
lying
it
was
a
question
of
impudent
blackmail
i
had
expected
something
of
the
sort
and
was
prepared
you
saw
how
the
cowardly
hound
ran
away
quite
so
morse
of
course
a
man
in
your
position
must
be
subject
to
these
things
occasionally
ah
you
see
that
he
said
briskly
and
i
knew
he
was
relieved
you
are
a
man
of
the
world
and
you
see
that
well
i
am
thankful
for
your
promise
of
silence
i
am
the
more
annoyed
though
that
juanita
should
have
been
present
at
a
scene
which
though
really
burlesque
must
have
seemed
to
her
one
of
violence
i
had
my
own
opinion
about
the
burlesque
nature
of
the
incident
but
i
made
haste
to
reassure
him
of
course
i
said
it
must
have
been
distressing
for
any
lady
but
it
was
the
suddenness
that
upset
her
and
i
sure
miss
morse
nerves
are
far
too
good
for
it
to
have
any
permanent
effect
yes
he
answered
and
in
his
voice
there
was
a
caress
i
can
explain
it
all
to
juanita
and
the
memory
of
this
evening
will
soon
go
from
her
again
i
had
my
own
private
opinion
which
i
forbore
to
state
personally
i
had
very
little
doubt
but
that
juanita
would
remember
this
evening
as
long
as
the
darling
lived
it
would
not
be
my
fault
if
she
did
but
i
saw
that
this
was
no
moment
to
tell
him
that
i
loved
her
perhaps
if
we
had
been
granted
five
minutes
more
in
the
conservatory
and
i
had
said
all
i
meant
and
heard
from
her
all
i
hoped
i
should
have
spoken
then
as
it
was
i
could
not
though
in
my
own
mind
i
was
certain
she
cared
for
me
we
were
silent
for
a
few
moments
and
then
morse
seemed
to
recall
himself
from
private
thought
i
had
nearly
forgotten
he
said
you
specially
wanted
to
see
me
sir
thomas
and
you
very
kindly
waited
in
order
to
do
so
then
i
remembered
the
errand
upon
which
i
had
come
and
pulled
myself
together
mentally
i
liked
morse
he
was
of
tremendous
importance
to
me
and
yet
at
the
same
time
it
behooved
me
to
be
wary
already
i
was
certain
that
he
was
playing
a
game
with
me
in
the
matter
of
mark
antony
midwinter
whose
name
i
kept
rigidly
to
myself
i
must
play
my
cards
carefully
please
understand
me
i
do
for
a
moment
mean
that
i
felt
he
was
my
enemy
or
inimical
to
me
in
any
way
far
from
it
i
knew
that
he
liked
me
and
would
do
me
a
bad
turn
if
he
could
help
it
at
the
same
time
i
was
perfectly
sure
that
if
necessary
he
would
use
me
like
a
pawn
in
a
mysterious
game
that
i
could
fathom
and
i
did
mean
to
be
used
like
a
pawn
if
i
could
help
it
my
hope
and
ambition
was
to
serve
him
but
i
wanted
a
little
reserve
of
power
also
for
reasons
i
need
not
indicate
yes
i
said
i
telephoned
you
and
you
mentioned
a
certain
word
which
rather
puzzled
me
i
did
was
the
word
i
believe
we
are
going
to
meet
at
the
towers
at
cerne
in
norfolk
said
morse
sir
walter
stileman
told
me
that
you
were
to
be
of
the
shooting
party
in
september
at
that
i
laughed
frankly
really
he
was
a
little
underestimating
me
he
grinned
and
understood
in
a
second
tell
me
sir
thomas
exactly
what
you
mean
he
said
well
you
know
i
am
a
newspaper
proprietor
and
editor
of
the
best
written
and
most
alive
journal
in
london
i
bowed
and
produced
from
an
inside
pocket
master
bill
astonishing
piece
of
copy
an
unknown
journalist
who
was
introduced
to
me
i
said
brought
a
piece
of
news
which
would
be
of
absorbing
interest
to
the
country
if
it
were
published
and
if
it
were
true
perhaps
you
would
like
to
read
this
i
handed
him
the
typewritten
copy
and
prepared
to
watch
his
face
as
he
read
it
but
he
was
too
clever
for
that
he
took
it
and
perused
it
walking
up
and
down
the
room
and
i
began
to
realize
some
of
the
qualities
which
had
made
this
man
one
of
the
powers
of
the
world
more
especially
so
when
he
came
and
sat
down
again
his
face
wreathed
in
smiles
though
i
could
have
sworn
fury
lurked
in
the
depths
of
his
black
eyes
well
now
he
said
this
is
interesting
very
interesting
indeed
i
am
going
to
be
quite
frank
with
you
sir
thomas
there
an
amount
of
truth
in
this
manuscript
that
would
cause
me
colossal
worry
if
it
were
published
at
present
another
thing
it
would
do
would
be
to
quite
upset
a
financial
operation
of
considerable
magnitude
personally
i
should
lose
at
the
very
least
a
couple
of
million
sterling
though
that
would
make
any
appreciable
difference
to
my
fortune
but
a
lot
of
other
people
would
be
ruined
and
for
no
possible
benefit
to
any
one
in
the
world
except
yourself
and
the
thank
you
i
said
that
just
why
i
came
of
course
nothing
shall
be
published
though
i
quite
in
the
dark
as
to
the
nature
of
the
whole
thing
i
call
that
generous
generous
beyond
belief
sir
thomas
for
i
know
that
it
is
the
life
of
a
newspaper
to
get
hold
of
exclusive
news
i
would
offer
you
a
large
sum
not
to
publish
this
story
did
i
not
know
that
you
would
indignantly
refuse
it
i
am
a
student
of
men
my
young
friend
if
i
may
be
allowed
to
call
you
so
and
even
if
you
were
a
poor
man
instead
of
being
a
rich
one
as
ordinary
wealth
goes
i
should
never
make
such
a
proposition
i
glowed
inwardly
as
he
said
it
it
was
a
downright
compliment
coming
from
him
under
the
circumstances
at
which
any
one
would
have
been
warmed
to
the
heart
for
here
was
a
great
man
a
napoleon
of
his
day
one
who
if
he
chose
could
upset
dynasties
and
plunge
nations
into
war
yet
as
i
knew
quite
well
gideon
mendoza
morse
was
a
member
of
the
great
financial
groups
who
control
and
sway
politics
in
a
sense
he
was
that
rare
thing
a
pastoral
millionaire
he
owned
vast
tracts
of
country
populated
by
lowing
steers
for
the
food
of
the
world
in
the
remote
mountains
of
brazil
brown
indians
toiled
to
wrest
precious
metals
and
jewels
from
the
earth
for
his
advantage
but
from
the
feverish
plotting
of
international
finance
i
knew
him
to
stand
aloof
i
very
much
appreciate
your
remarks
was
what
i
told
him
and
you
may
rest
assured
that
nothing
shall
transpire
thanks
but
all
the
generosity
must
be
on
your
side
you
shall
have
your
scoop
sir
thomas
if
you
will
wait
a
little
while
i
am
entirely
at
your
service
very
well
then
he
said
and
his
manner
grew
extraordinarily
cordial
let
put
a
period
to
it
i
hope
that
from
i
and
my
daughter
are
going
to
see
a
great
deal
of
you
a
great
deal
more
of
you
than
hitherto
you
know
how
we
are
he
gave
a
little
annoyed
laugh
run
after
in
london
and
what
a
success
juanita
has
had
over
here
what
i
hope
to
do
is
to
form
a
little
inner
circle
of
friends
and
you
must
be
one
of
them
if
you
will
how
my
luck
held
i
thought
here
offered
freely
and
with
open
hands
was
the
only
thing
i
wanted
i
am
glad
to
think
that
i
found
a
moment
in
which
to
be
sorry
for
arthur
and
dear
old
pat
moore
it
awfully
good
of
you
i
stammered
he
made
a
little
impatient
gesture
with
his
hand
please
do
talk
nonsense
he
said
and
now
about
the
towers
on
richmond
hill
i
have
told
you
that
i
can
not
explain
fully
until
september
i
will
tell
you
though
that
your
clever
little
journalist
what
by
the
way
did
you
say
his
name
was
rolston
of
course
has
ferreted
out
much
that
i
wished
to
conceal
but
he
entirely
upon
the
right
track
i
kirby
at
the
bottom
of
the
whole
thing
and
i
have
spent
goodness
knows
how
much
to
keep
that
quiet
he
lit
another
cigarette
leant
back
in
his
chair
and
laughed
like
a
boy
i
bribed
and
bribed
and
bribed
i
managed
to
put
pressure
actually
to
put
pressure
upon
the
british
government
i
employed
an
untold
number
of
agents
in
short
i
exercised
the
whole
of
my
intellect
and
the
pressure
of
almost
unlimited
capital
to
keep
my
name
out
of
it
and
now
you
tell
me
some
little
journalist
has
found
out
one
thing
at
least
that
i
was
determined
to
conceal
until
september
next
the
plans
of
men
and
mice
gang
oft
agley
kirby
this
little
man
of
yours
must
be
a
sort
of
genius
i
hope
there
are
no
more
people
like
him
prowling
about
richmond
hill
i
was
quite
certain
that
there
was
not
another
bill
rolston
anywhere
and
i
amused
morse
immensely
by
detailing
the
circumstances
of
the
little
man
arrival
in
fleet
street
i
never
realized
till
now
how
human
and
genial
the
great
man
could
be
for
he
even
expanded
sufficiently
to
offer
to
toss
me
a
thousand
pounds
to
nothing
for
the
services
of
julia
dewsbury
i
saw
my
way
with
juanita
becoming
smoother
and
smoother
every
moment
it
was
growing
late
nearly
one
when
morse
insisted
on
having
some
bisque
soup
brought
in
i
think
we
both
want
something
really
sustaining
he
said
do
you
begin
and
i
just
run
up
and
see
my
señora
balmaceda
and
find
out
if
juanita
is
all
right
he
left
the
room
and
happy
that
all
had
gone
so
well
i
sipped
the
incomparable
white
essence
and
gave
myself
up
to
dreams
of
the
future
i
was
to
see
her
often
in
september
at
sir
walter
stileman
morse
was
to
take
me
into
his
fullest
confidence
that
could
only
mean
one
thing
within
a
little
less
than
three
months
he
would
give
his
consent
to
my
marriage
with
his
daughter
another
opportunity
like
this
of
and
juanita
and
i
would
be
betrothed
it
would
be
delightful
to
keep
our
secret
until
the
shooting
began
i
would
follow
her
through
the
events
of
the
season
watch
her
mood
hear
her
extolled
on
every
side
knowing
all
the
time
she
was
mine
a
vision
came
to
me
of
cowes
week
the
gardens
of
the
squadron
juanita
on
board
of
my
own
yacht
moonlight
i
think
i
must
have
fallen
asleep
when
i
started
into
consciousness
to
find
myself
staring
into
the
great
broken
mirror
over
the
mantelpiece
and
to
find
that
morse
had
returned
and
was
smiling
down
upon
me
she
all
right
thank
heavens
he
said
and
has
been
asleep
for
a
long
time
and
now
as
you
seem
sleepy
too
i
bid
you
with
a
thousand
thanks
for
your
consideration
it
was
nearly
two
i
noticed
when
i
stepped
out
into
the
cool
air
of
piccadilly
and
walked
the
few
yards
to
my
flat
i
must
have
been
asleep
for
quite
a
long
time
and
dear
old
morse
had
forborne
to
waken
me
i
peculiarly
remember
my
sense
of
and
happiness
during
that
short
walk
i
was
in
a
glow
of
satisfaction
everything
had
turned
out
even
better
than
i
had
expected
what
did
the
scoop
for
the
paper
matter
after
all
nothing
in
comparison
with
the
more
or
less
intimate
relations
in
which
i
now
stood
with
gideon
morse
i
was
to
see
juanita
constantly
she
was
almost
mine
already
and
fortune
had
been
marvelously
on
my
side
of
course
there
would
be
obstacles
there
was
no
doubt
of
that
i
was
no
real
match
for
her
but
the
obstacles
in
the
future
were
as
nothing
to
those
that
had
been
already
surmounted
i
began
to
smile
with
conceit
at
the
diplomatic
way
in
which
i
had
dealt
with
the
great
financier
not
for
a
single
moment
as
i
put
my
key
into
the
latch
did
i
dream
that
i
had
been
played
with
the
utmost
skill
tied
myself
irrevocably
to
silence
and
that
horrible
trouble
and
grim
peril
even
now
walked
unseen
by
my
side
when
i
got
into
the
i
found
things
just
as
usual
i
had
hardly
lit
a
last
cigarette
when
the
door
opened
and
preston
entered
good
heavens
i
said
i
never
told
you
to
wait
up
for
me
preston
there
was
not
the
slightest
need
you
ought
to
have
been
in
bed
hours
ago
so
i
was
sir
thomas
he
said
looking
at
me
in
a
surprised
sort
of
way
and
i
noticed
for
the
first
time
that
he
was
wearing
a
gray
flannel
and
slippers
what
do
you
mean
until
the
telephone
message
came
sir
thomas
what
telephone
message
why
yours
sir
thomas
i
never
telephoned
when
do
you
mean
not
very
long
ago
sir
thomas
he
said
i
did
take
particular
notice
of
the
time
somewhere
between
one
and
now
i
was
on
the
alert
at
once
though
i
could
not
have
particularly
said
why
are
you
quite
sure
that
it
was
i
who
but
yes
he
answered
it
was
your
voice
sir
thomas
you
said
you
were
speaking
from
the
office
from
the
i
not
been
there
since
late
afternoon
and
when
have
i
ever
been
there
so
late
there
never
more
than
one
person
there
all
night
long
until
six
in
the
morning
it
not
a
morning
paper
as
you
know
preston
seemed
more
than
ever
bewildered
as
i
flung
this
at
him
all
i
can
say
is
sir
thomas
he
said
that
i
heard
your
voice
distinctly
and
you
said
you
were
at
the
office
what
did
i
say
exactly
about
the
young
gentleman
sir
thomas
the
young
gentleman
who
has
come
to
stay
for
a
time
your
instructions
were
that
he
should
be
wakened
and
told
to
come
to
fleet
street
without
the
least
delay
you
also
said
a
taxicab
would
be
waiting
for
him
by
the
time
he
was
dressed
to
drive
him
down
and
he
went
certainly
sir
thomas
he
was
in
his
clothes
quicker
than
i
ever
see
a
gentleman
dress
before
had
a
glass
of
milk
and
a
biscuit
and
the
cab
was
just
coming
as
i
went
down
with
him
and
opened
the
front
door
i
rushed
out
of
the
room
down
the
corridor
and
into
that
which
had
been
placed
at
rolston
disposal
it
was
as
preston
said
the
lad
was
gone
the
bed
was
tumbled
as
he
had
left
it
but
a
portmanteau
full
of
clothes
some
hair
brushes
and
a
tooth
brush
on
the
remained
clearly
rolston
believed
he
was
obeying
orders
preston
had
followed
me
out
of
the
and
stood
at
the
door
a
picture
of
uneasy
wonder
let
me
say
at
once
that
preston
had
been
with
me
for
six
years
and
was
at
my
father
house
for
i
know
how
many
more
he
is
the
most
faithful
and
devoted
creature
on
earth
and
what
is
more
as
sharp
as
a
needle
he
at
any
rate
had
no
hand
in
this
business
there
something
extraordinarily
queer
about
this
i
said
i
assure
you
that
i
have
never
been
near
the
telephone
during
the
whole
night
i
dined
with
lord
arthur
in
soho
and
the
rest
of
the
evening
i
have
been
spending
at
the
ritz
hotel
with
gideon
morse
you
been
tricked
preston
i
extremely
sorry
sir
thomas
he
was
beginning
when
i
cut
him
short
it
not
in
the
least
your
fault
but
are
you
certain
the
voice
was
mine
he
frowned
with
the
effort
at
recollection
well
sir
thomas
he
said
if
you
had
told
me
what
you
have
i
believe
i
could
almost
have
sworn
to
it
of
course
voices
are
altered
on
the
telephone
to
some
extent
but
it
extraordinary
how
they
do
in
the
main
keep
their
individual
character
he
spoke
the
truth
i
who
was
using
the
telephone
all
day
entirely
agreed
with
him
well
preston
it
was
a
skillful
imitation
and
not
my
voice
at
all
if
you
will
excuse
me
sir
thomas
he
replied
your
voice
is
a
very
distinctive
one
it
not
very
easily
mistaken
by
any
one
who
has
heard
your
voice
once
or
twice
that
only
makes
the
thing
the
more
mysterious
the
more
easy
i
should
say
sir
thomas
it
must
be
far
less
difficult
to
imitate
an
outstanding
voice
with
marked
peculiarities
than
an
ordinary
one
he
was
right
there
it
had
occurred
to
me
before
but
who
in
the
office
would
dare
to
imitate
my
voice
that
of
course
i
could
not
say
sir
thomas
but
we
only
the
word
of
the
unknown
person
who
rang
me
up
that
he
was
speaking
from
the
office
for
all
we
know
he
might
have
been
in
the
next
flat
that
again
was
a
point
and
i
noted
it
i
not
going
to
waste
any
time
i
said
i
go
down
to
the
office
at
once
and
see
if
i
can
find
out
anything
he
helped
me
on
with
my
coat
and
within
five
minutes
of
my
entering
i
was
again
in
piccadilly
already
the
long
ribbon
of
road
was
beginning
to
be
faintly
tinged
with
gray
the
dawn
was
not
yet
but
night
was
flitting
away
before
his
coming
save
for
an
occasional
policeman
and
the
rumble
of
heavy
carts
piled
with
vegetables
and
flowers
for
covent
garden
the
great
street
was
empty
i
passed
the
ritz
hotel
with
a
tender
thought
of
one
who
lay
sleeping
there
and
hurried
eastwards
i
had
nearly
got
to
the
circus
when
a
taxi
swung
out
of
the
haymarket
and
i
hailed
the
man
he
was
tired
and
sleepy
had
been
waiting
for
hours
at
some
club
or
other
but
i
persuaded
him
with
much
gold
to
take
me
and
we
buzzed
away
toward
the
street
of
ink
here
was
activity
enough
the
later
editions
of
the
morning
papers
were
being
vomited
out
of
holes
in
the
earth
by
hundreds
of
thousands
windows
were
lighted
up
everywhere
as
i
turned
down
a
side
street
leading
to
the
river
and
came
to
my
own
offices
i
unlocked
the
door
with
my
pass
key
and
almost
immediately
i
was
confronted
by
johns
the
who
flashed
his
torch
in
my
face
and
inquired
my
business
i
was
pleased
to
see
the
man
alert
and
at
his
post
and
asked
who
was
in
the
building
only
benson
sir
thomas
it
his
week
for
night
duty
i
went
up
and
very
considerably
surprised
not
to
say
alarmed
young
benson
who
had
the
photograph
of
a
lady
propped
up
on
a
desk
before
him
and
was
obviously
inditing
an
amorous
epistle
i
put
him
through
the
most
searching
possible
until
i
was
quite
sure
that
he
had
never
telephoned
to
my
flat
i
knew
him
for
a
truthful
conscientious
fellow
without
a
glimpse
of
humor
or
the
slightest
histrionic
talent
johns
called
from
below
was
equally
emphatic
certainly
no
taxi
had
arrived
here
during
the
last
three
hours
nor
had
william
rolston
come
near
the
office
i
returned
to
piccadilly
utterly
baffled
and
without
a
single
ray
of
light
in
my
mind
chapter
five
on
the
morning
of
the
fourteenth
of
september
i
met
captain
pat
moore
and
lord
arthur
winstanley
at
liverpool
street
station
we
were
all
three
of
us
asked
to
cerne
as
guests
of
that
fine
old
sportsman
sir
walter
stileman
a
special
carriage
was
reserved
for
us
and
our
servants
filled
it
with
luncheon
baskets
and
gun
cases
it
was
almost
exactly
three
months
since
my
eventful
night
at
the
ritz
with
gideon
morse
and
the
disappearance
of
little
william
rolston
what
had
passed
since
that
time
i
can
set
out
fully
in
a
very
few
words
first
of
all
the
position
in
which
i
stood
with
regard
to
juanita
it
was
somewhat
extraordinary
satisfactory
and
yet
unsatisfactory
utterly
tantalizing
morse
had
kept
his
promise
i
seen
a
great
deal
of
his
daughter
at
henley
at
cowes
on
board
the
wonderful
yacht
or
on
my
own
in
the
sacred
gardens
of
the
where
we
met
and
met
again
yet
these
meetings
were
always
in
public
juanita
was
surrounded
by
men
wherever
she
went
she
was
the
reigning
beauty
of
her
year
her
minutest
doings
were
chronicled
in
the
society
papers
with
a
wealth
of
detail
that
was
astounding
i
used
to
read
the
stuff
including
that
of
my
own
miss
easey
with
a
sort
of
impotent
rage
some
of
it
was
true
a
lot
of
it
was
lies
and
surmise
but
to
me
it
was
all
distasteful
juanita
lived
in
the
full
glare
of
the
public
eye
and
a
royal
princess
could
hardly
have
been
more
unapproachable
of
course
i
used
stratagems
innumerable
and
more
than
once
she
went
to
meet
me
but
the
long
desired
never
came
to
pass
it
was
not
only
because
of
the
troop
of
admirers
that
crowded
round
her
of
which
i
was
only
one
but
there
was
an
extraordinary
adroitness
a
hidden
hand
at
work
somewhere
to
keep
us
apart
i
was
quite
certain
of
this
yet
i
could
not
prove
it
though
even
if
i
had
it
would
have
been
of
little
use
old
señora
balmaceda
who
overwhelmed
me
with
kindness
and
attention
was
simply
wonderful
in
her
watch
over
juanita
as
for
gideon
morse
he
would
talk
to
me
by
the
hour
and
his
talk
was
well
worth
listening
to
but
somehow
or
other
he
was
always
in
the
way
when
i
wanted
to
be
alone
with
his
daughter
of
course
i
sometimes
thought
i
was
exaggerating
and
that
i
was
so
hard
hit
that
i
saw
things
in
a
jaundiced
or
prejudiced
light
yet
certainly
juanita
was
often
alone
for
a
short
time
with
other
men
than
i
notably
with
the
young
and
duke
of
perth
whom
i
hated
as
cordially
as
i
knew
how
then
in
august
i
had
a
nasty
knock
the
morses
went
off
to
scotland
for
the
grouse
shooting
as
guests
of
the
duke
and
i
was
asked
or
ever
in
the
way
of
being
asked
if
it
comes
to
that
to
join
the
small
and
select
that
the
papers
were
so
full
of
i
had
to
content
myself
with
pictures
on
the
front
page
of
the
illustrated
weeklies
depicting
juanita
in
a
tweed
skirt
and
a
tam
o
shanter
side
by
side
with
perth
wearing
a
fatuous
smile
and
a
gun
i
had
one
crumb
of
consolation
only
and
that
was
when
saying
to
juanita
i
felt
something
small
and
hard
in
the
palm
of
her
hand
it
was
a
little
tightly
folded
piece
of
paper
and
on
it
was
one
word
cerne
that
of
course
helped
a
great
deal
it
was
obvious
what
she
meant
when
we
met
at
sir
walter
stileman
then
at
last
my
opportunity
would
come
and
now
about
the
little
journalist
and
his
extraordinary
disappearance
i
made
every
possible
inquiry
engaging
the
most
skilled
agents
and
sparing
no
money
in
the
quest
but
i
found
out
nothing
absolutely
nothing
the
lad
with
the
prominent
ears
had
vanished
into
thin
air
had
flashed
into
my
life
for
a
moment
and
then
gone
out
of
it
with
the
completeness
of
an
extinguished
candle
he
had
been
he
was
no
more
poor
miss
dewsbury
on
whom
the
disappearance
had
a
marked
effect
discussed
the
matter
with
me
a
dozen
times
we
broached
theory
after
theory
only
to
reject
them
and
at
last
we
ceased
to
talk
about
the
matter
at
all
i
remember
her
words
on
the
last
time
we
talked
of
it
they
were
prophetic
though
i
did
not
know
it
then
all
i
can
say
is
sir
thomas
that
voices
not
my
own
whisper
constantly
in
my
ear
that
the
shadow
of
the
three
giant
towers
upon
richmond
hill
lies
across
your
path
poor
thing
she
was
almost
hysterical
in
those
times
and
i
paid
little
heed
to
her
words
as
for
the
scoop
no
other
paper
had
even
hinted
at
rolston
revelation
i
had
faithfully
kept
my
word
to
morse
not
forgetting
that
he
had
promised
to
explain
everything
in
september
as
the
train
swung
out
of
liverpool
street
and
pat
and
arthur
were
ragging
each
other
as
to
who
should
have
the
first
i
experienced
a
sense
of
mental
relief
only
a
few
hours
now
and
the
great
question
of
my
life
would
be
settled
once
and
for
all
no
more
doubts
no
more
uncertainties
during
the
last
three
months
arthur
and
pat
had
left
me
very
much
to
myself
they
had
behaved
with
the
most
perfect
tact
and
kindness
arthur
as
i
have
said
having
obtained
for
me
the
invitation
to
cerne
now
after
we
had
traveled
for
a
couple
of
hours
and
the
luncheon
baskets
had
been
opened
old
pat
lit
a
cigar
and
looked
across
at
me
his
big
brown
face
was
grave
and
he
played
with
his
mustache
as
if
in
some
embarrassment
he
and
arthur
glanced
at
each
other
and
i
understood
what
was
in
their
minds
look
here
you
fellows
i
said
about
the
sacred
brotherhood
what
is
it
in
spanish
santa
hermandad
said
arthur
well
you
kept
your
oath
splendidly
i
can
not
thank
you
enough
i
have
had
the
running
all
to
myself
as
far
as
you
two
are
concerned
for
twelve
weeks
yes
twelve
weeks
pat
replied
with
a
sigh
we
kept
out
of
the
way
old
fellow
and
i
tell
you
it
been
hard
arthur
nodded
in
corroboration
and
somehow
or
other
i
felt
myself
a
cur
since
boyhood
we
three
had
been
like
brothers
and
it
was
a
hard
fate
indeed
that
led
us
to
center
all
our
hopes
upon
something
that
could
belong
to
one
alone
despite
what
must
have
been
their
burning
eagerness
to
know
how
things
stood
both
of
them
were
far
too
and
to
ask
a
question
i
knew
it
was
up
to
me
to
satisfy
them
without
going
into
details
i
said
i
tell
you
just
how
it
is
how
i
think
it
is
for
i
may
be
quite
wrong
and
presuming
upon
what
exist
i
thought
for
a
moment
and
chose
my
words
carefully
it
was
extremely
difficult
to
say
what
i
had
to
say
it
comes
to
about
this
i
got
out
at
last
i
every
reason
to
believe
that
she
likes
me
there
nothing
decisive
but
i
been
given
some
hope
i
very
nearly
put
it
to
the
test
three
months
ago
but
was
interrupted
and
never
had
the
chance
again
at
cerne
i
going
to
try
finally
by
hook
or
crook
in
hours
i
have
some
news
for
you
and
if
i
get
the
sack
then
let
the
next
man
go
in
and
win
if
he
can
and
i
join
the
third
in
doing
everything
that
lies
in
my
power
to
help
him
i
am
next
said
pat
moore
not
that
i
the
deuce
of
a
chance
but
i
think
you
spoken
like
a
damn
good
sort
tom
and
we
thank
you
arthur
and
i
will
do
our
best
to
keep
every
one
else
off
the
grass
while
you
go
in
and
try
your
luck
faith
i
make
love
to
the
duenna
with
the
white
hair
meself
and
keep
her
out
of
the
way
and
arthur
here
will
consult
with
morse
upon
the
expediency
of
investing
his
large
capital
which
he
has
got
in
a
farm
anyhow
perth
who
has
been
the
safety
bet
with
all
the
tipsters
wo
be
there
he
such
a
rotten
shot
that
sir
walter
would
dream
of
asking
him
the
bag
has
got
to
be
kept
up
for
three
years
now
only
sandringham
has
beat
it
and
a
duffer
at
a
drive
would
send
the
average
down
appallingly
what
about
me
i
asked
with
a
sinking
of
the
heart
god
forgive
me
said
arthur
i
lied
about
you
to
sir
walter
like
the
secretary
of
a
building
society
to
a
maiden
lady
with
two
thousand
pounds
he
was
astonished
that
he
had
never
heard
of
your
shooting
of
course
he
knows
all
the
shots
of
the
day
and
i
had
to
tell
him
a
fairy
story
about
your
late
lamented
father
who
was
a
puritan
and
would
never
let
his
son
join
country
because
they
played
cards
after
dinner
i
smiled
on
the
wrong
side
of
my
mouth
my
dear
old
governor
had
been
anything
but
a
puritan
i
feared
the
scandal
which
would
inevitably
ensue
when
i
went
out
for
the
first
big
drive
that
all
right
tom
said
arthur
you
simply
have
to
sprain
your
ankle
or
i
give
you
a
good
hack
in
the
shin
privately
if
you
like
sir
walter
has
only
to
send
a
wire
to
get
a
gun
down
there
are
at
least
a
dozen
men
i
know
who
would
almost
commit
parricide
for
the
chance
after
that
by
general
consent
the
subject
of
the
league
was
dropped
we
all
knew
where
we
were
and
for
the
rest
of
the
journey
we
talked
of
ordinary
things
it
was
a
bright
afternoon
in
early
autumn
when
we
stopped
at
the
little
local
station
and
got
into
a
waiting
while
our
servants
collected
our
things
and
followed
in
the
baggage
lorry
for
myself
i
felt
in
the
highest
spirits
as
we
buzzed
along
the
three
miles
to
cerne
hall
there
was
a
pleasant
nip
in
the
air
the
vast
landscape
was
yellow
gold
as
acre
after
acre
of
stubble
stretched
towards
the
horizon
gray
church
towers
embowered
in
trees
broke
the
vast
monotony
and
i
surrendered
myself
to
a
happy
dream
of
juanita
while
arthur
and
pat
talked
shooting
and
marked
covies
that
rose
on
either
side
as
we
whirred
by
when
we
arrived
at
cerne
hall
it
was
not
yet
and
everybody
was
out
the
butler
showed
us
to
our
rooms
all
close
together
in
the
south
wing
of
the
fine
old
house
and
i
smoked
a
cigarette
while
preston
was
unpacking
everybody
arrived
yet
preston
i
asked
not
yet
sir
thomas
so
i
understand
i
and
captain
moore
man
and
his
lordship
was
havin
a
cherry
brandy
in
the
housekeeper
room
just
now
and
the
bulk
of
the
will
be
arriving
by
the
later
train
between
tea
and
dinner
sir
thomas
and
mr
morse
only
just
before
dinner
sir
thomas
he
always
travels
in
a
special
train
i
saw
by
preston
face
that
he
considered
this
a
snobbish
and
ostentatious
thing
to
do
and
in
the
case
of
an
ordinary
i
should
certainly
have
agreed
with
him
but
i
recalled
facts
that
had
come
to
my
notice
about
the
famous
brazilian
and
i
wondered
there
was
the
astounding
scene
at
the
ritz
for
instance
and
more
than
that
i
had
not
been
following
up
juanita
for
three
months
in
town
at
henley
and
at
cowes
without
noticing
that
gideon
morse
seemed
to
have
an
unobtrusive
but
quite
singular
entourage
more
than
once
for
example
i
had
caught
sight
of
a
certain
great
hulking
man
in
tweeds
a
professional
bruiser
if
ever
there
was
one
tea
was
in
the
hall
of
the
great
house
i
was
introduced
to
sir
walter
a
delightful
man
with
a
hooked
nose
a
tiny
mustache
the
remains
of
gray
hair
and
a
charming
smile
lady
stileman
also
made
me
most
welcome
her
hair
was
gray
but
her
figure
was
slight
and
upright
as
a
girl
and
many
girls
in
the
county
must
have
envied
her
dainty
prettiness
and
the
charm
of
her
lazy
musical
voice
circumstances
paired
me
off
with
a
vivacious
young
lady
whose
face
i
seemed
to
know
whose
surname
i
could
not
catch
but
whom
every
one
called
poppy
i
say
she
said
after
her
third
cup
of
tea
and
fourth
egg
sandwich
you
the
are
you
i
admitted
it
well
she
said
i
do
think
you
might
give
me
a
show
now
and
then
considering
the
press
i
generally
get
i
never
been
quite
able
to
understand
why
the
leaves
me
out
of
it
i
thought
she
must
be
an
actress
and
yet
she
had
quite
that
manner
at
any
rate
i
said
i
awfully
sorry
but
you
see
i
only
editor
and
i
nothing
really
to
do
with
the
dramatic
criticism
however
please
say
the
word
and
i
ginger
up
my
man
at
once
dramatic
criticism
she
said
her
eyes
wide
with
surprise
sir
thomas
can
it
really
be
that
you
do
know
who
i
am
it
was
a
little
embarrassing
do
you
know
i
know
your
face
awfully
well
i
said
though
i
quite
sure
we
never
met
before
or
i
should
have
remembered
and
when
lady
stileman
introduced
us
just
now
all
i
caught
was
poppy
she
sighed
i
should
put
her
between
nineteen
and
twenty
in
age
well
for
a
london
editor
you
a
fossil
though
you
do
look
more
than
about
why
poppy
boynton
then
in
a
flash
i
knew
this
was
the
hon
poppy
boynton
lord
portesham
daughter
the
flying
girl
the
leading
lady
aviator
who
had
looped
the
loop
over
mont
blanc
and
done
all
sorts
of
mad
extraordinary
things
i
know
you
miss
boynton
only
i
never
expected
to
meet
you
here
what
a
chance
for
an
editor
do
tell
me
all
your
adventures
will
you
give
me
a
column
interview
on
the
front
page
if
i
do
of
course
i
will
i
write
it
myself
and
a
large
photograph
half
the
back
page
if
you
like
you
a
dear
she
said
in
a
voice
on
second
thoughts
i
write
the
interview
myself
and
give
it
you
before
we
leave
here
and
meanwhile
i
tell
you
an
extraordinary
flight
of
mine
only
yesterday
i
was
in
for
it
and
there
was
no
way
out
still
she
was
extremely
pretty
and
a
celebrity
in
her
way
so
i
settled
myself
to
listen
what
did
you
do
yesterday
morning
i
asked
did
you
loop
the
loop
over
saint
paul
or
something
loop
the
loop
she
replied
with
great
contempt
that
an
infantile
stunt
of
the
dark
ages
no
i
went
for
my
usual
morning
fly
before
breakfast
and
saw
a
marvel
and
got
cursed
by
a
djinn
out
of
the
arabian
nights
this
sounded
fairly
promising
for
a
start
but
as
she
went
on
i
jerked
like
a
fish
in
a
basket
you
know
the
great
wireless
towers
on
richmond
hill
of
course
the
highest
erection
in
the
world
is
it
more
than
twice
the
height
of
the
eiffel
tower
you
can
see
the
things
from
all
parts
of
london
on
a
clear
day
she
nodded
the
rest
of
the
time
the
top
is
quite
hidden
by
clouds
now
it
struck
me
i
go
and
have
a
look
at
them
close
to
our
place
norman
court
is
only
about
fifteen
miles
farther
up
the
thames
i
started
off
in
my
little
and
rose
to
about
fifteen
hundred
feet
at
once
when
i
got
into
a
bank
of
fleecy
wet
cloud
fortunately
not
more
than
a
hundred
yards
or
so
thick
it
was
keeping
all
the
sun
from
london
about
yesterday
morning
when
i
came
out
above
of
course
i
was
sure
of
my
direction
but
as
i
turned
the
machine
a
point
or
so
i
saw
standing
up
straight
out
of
the
cloud
at
not
more
than
six
miles
away
the
tops
of
the
towers
i
headed
straight
for
them
she
lit
a
cigarette
and
i
noticed
her
face
changed
a
little
there
was
an
introspective
look
in
the
eyes
a
look
of
memory
as
i
drew
near
sir
thomas
i
saw
what
i
think
is
the
most
marvelous
sight
i
have
seen
you
people
who
crawl
about
on
earth
never
do
see
what
see
i
have
flown
over
mont
blanc
and
seen
the
dawn
upon
the
matterhorn
and
monte
rosa
from
that
height
and
i
thought
that
was
the
most
heavenly
thing
ever
seen
by
mortal
eye
but
yesterday
morning
i
beat
that
impression
yes
right
on
the
outskirts
of
london
and
only
a
few
hours
ago
down
from
below
nobody
can
really
see
much
of
the
towers
you
have
seen
much
for
instance
have
you
only
that
they
now
all
linked
together
at
the
top
by
the
most
intricate
series
of
girders
on
the
suspension
principle
i
suppose
there
are
a
lot
of
sheds
and
things
on
this
artificial
space
or
at
least
it
looks
like
it
sheds
and
things
sir
thomas
i
thought
i
saw
the
new
jerusalem
floating
on
the
clouds
the
morning
sun
poured
down
upon
a
vast
hanging
space
of
which
you
can
have
no
conception
and
rising
up
on
every
side
from
ramparts
were
towers
and
cupolas
with
gilded
roofs
which
blazed
like
gold
there
were
fantastic
halls
pierced
with
oriental
windows
walls
which
glowed
like
jacinth
and
amethyst
and
parapets
of
pearl
it
was
a
city
a
city
in
the
clouds
a
place
of
enchantment
floating
high
high
up
above
the
smoke
and
the
din
of
london
serene
majestic
and
utterly
lovely
i
tell
you
here
her
voice
dropped
the
vision
caught
at
my
heart
and
a
great
lump
came
into
my
throat
i
pretty
too
as
i
went
past
one
side
of
the
immense
triangle
which
must
occupy
several
acres
on
which
the
city
is
built
i
saw
an
inner
courtyard
with
what
seemed
like
green
lawns
i
could
swear
there
were
trees
planted
there
and
that
a
great
fountain
was
playing
like
a
stream
of
liquid
diamonds
i
was
so
startled
and
almost
frightened
that
i
ripped
away
for
several
miles
till
descending
a
little
through
the
i
found
i
was
right
over
tower
bridge
but
i
swore
i
see
that
majestic
city
again
and
i
spiraled
up
and
turned
there
it
was
many
miles
away
now
a
mere
speck
upon
the
billowing
snow
of
the
and
as
i
raced
towards
it
once
more
it
grew
and
grew
into
all
its
former
loveliness
i
adjusted
my
engines
and
went
as
slow
as
i
possibly
could
perhaps
you
know
that
our
modern
aeroplanes
with
the
new
helicopter
central
screw
can
glide
at
not
much
more
than
fifteen
miles
an
hour
for
a
short
distance
that
is
well
that
what
i
did
and
once
more
the
place
burst
upon
me
in
all
its
wonder
it
the
marvel
of
marvels
sir
thomas
i
have
got
words
even
to
hint
at
it
i
could
see
details
more
clearly
now
and
i
floated
by
among
the
ramparts
on
one
side
not
a
pistol
shot
away
and
then
upon
the
top
of
a
little
flat
tower
there
appeared
the
most
extraordinary
figure
it
was
a
gigantic
man
in
a
long
robe
and
wide
sleeves
and
he
threw
his
hands
above
his
head
and
cursed
me
of
course
the
noise
of
the
engine
drowned
all
he
said
but
his
face
was
simply
fiendish
i
just
caught
one
flash
of
it
and
i
never
want
to
see
anything
like
it
again
i
sat
spellbound
in
my
chair
while
she
told
me
this
and
again
the
sense
that
i
was
being
borne
along
whither
i
knew
not
by
some
irresistible
current
of
fate
possessed
me
to
the
exclusion
of
all
else
why
you
look
quite
tired
and
gray
sir
thomas
said
miss
boynton
i
do
hope
i
have
bored
you
bored
me
i
was
away
up
in
the
air
with
you
looking
upon
that
enchanted
city
but
why
what
do
you
make
of
it
have
you
told
any
one
only
father
and
my
sister
who
said
that
it
must
have
been
an
illusion
of
the
mist
a
refraction
of
the
air
at
high
altitudes
that
transformed
the
wireless
instrument
sheds
to
fairyland
she
shrugged
her
shoulders
and
smiled
as
if
i
did
know
all
about
that
she
said
why
it
was
much
more
than
two
thousand
feet
up
a
mere
hop
i
had
to
think
very
rapidly
at
this
juncture
the
news
took
one
breath
away
to
begin
with
one
thing
seemed
perfectly
clear
gideon
morse
had
purposely
told
me
as
little
as
he
possibly
could
yet
upon
reflection
i
found
that
he
had
told
me
no
lies
he
had
admitted
that
he
was
at
the
bottom
of
this
colossal
enterprise
was
it
some
earl
court
of
the
air
the
last
word
in
amusement
catering
it
might
well
be
so
though
somehow
or
other
the
thought
annoyed
me
moreover
the
capital
outlay
must
have
been
so
vast
that
such
a
scheme
could
never
pay
interest
upon
it
then
i
recollected
that
in
a
few
hours
more
i
should
have
my
promised
talk
with
morse
and
he
would
explain
everything
as
he
had
promised
there
was
still
a
chance
of
a
big
scoop
for
the
look
here
miss
boynton
i
said
if
you
keep
what
you
have
seen
a
secret
for
the
next
two
days
and
then
let
me
publish
an
account
of
it
my
paper
would
gladly
pay
two
hundred
and
fifty
pounds
for
the
story
her
eyes
opened
wide
like
those
of
a
child
who
has
been
promised
a
very
big
box
of
chocolates
indeed
can
do
she
said
holding
out
a
pretty
little
hand
which
flying
had
in
no
way
roughened
or
distorted
i
took
it
and
so
the
bargain
was
made
soon
afterwards
more
guests
began
to
arrive
and
the
great
hall
was
full
of
laughing
chattering
figures
among
whom
were
several
people
that
i
knew
however
i
was
in
no
mood
for
society
or
small
talk
and
i
retired
to
my
own
room
and
sat
dreaming
before
a
comfortable
fire
until
preston
came
in
and
told
me
it
was
time
to
dress
i
was
ashamed
to
ask
him
if
the
morses
had
arrived
but
i
went
downstairs
into
a
large
yellow
half
full
of
people
and
looked
round
eagerly
lady
stileman
was
standing
by
one
of
the
fireplaces
talking
to
miss
boynton
and
i
went
up
to
them
apparently
it
was
a
wonderful
year
for
birds
as
partridges
and
partridges
alone
are
called
in
norfolk
they
had
hatched
out
much
later
than
usual
hence
the
waiting
until
the
middle
of
september
but
covies
were
abnormally
large
and
the
young
birds
already
strong
upon
the
wing
fortunately
lady
stileman
did
all
the
talking
i
smiled
looked
oracular
and
said
quite
so
at
intervals
my
eye
was
on
the
door
which
led
out
into
the
hall
once
twice
it
opened
but
only
to
admit
strangers
to
me
the
third
time
when
i
made
sure
i
should
see
her
for
whom
i
sought
no
one
came
in
but
a
footman
in
the
dark
green
livery
of
the
house
he
carried
a
salver
and
on
it
was
the
envelope
of
a
telegram
with
a
word
of
excuse
lady
stileman
opened
it
she
nodded
to
the
man
to
go
and
then
turned
to
me
and
poppy
boynton
such
a
disappointment
she
said
morse
and
his
wonderfully
pretty
daughter
were
to
have
been
here
as
i
think
you
know
now
he
wires
to
say
that
business
of
the
utmost
importance
prevents
either
him
or
his
daughter
coming
fortunately
the
good
lady
concluded
he
shoot
so
that
wo
throw
the
guns
out
walter
would
be
furious
if
that
happened
arthur
and
pat
moore
came
into
the
room
at
that
moment
and
arthur
told
me
an
hour
or
so
afterwards
that
i
looked
as
if
i
had
seen
a
ghost
and
that
my
face
was
white
as
paper
chapter
six
i
must
now
in
the
progress
of
the
story
give
a
brief
account
of
what
i
may
call
the
week
of
rumor
which
immediately
preceded
my
disappearance
and
plunge
into
the
unknown
i
spent
a
miserable
and
agitated
evening
at
cerne
hall
and
went
early
to
my
room
arthur
and
pat
joined
me
there
an
hour
later
and
for
some
time
we
talked
over
what
the
telegram
from
morse
might
mean
until
they
retired
to
their
own
rooms
and
i
was
left
alone
i
did
not
sleep
a
wink
indeed
i
made
no
effort
to
go
to
bed
though
i
took
off
my
clothes
and
wrapped
myself
in
a
the
suspense
was
almost
unbearable
and
failing
further
news
i
determined
at
any
cost
to
the
shooting
plans
of
my
host
to
get
myself
recalled
to
london
by
telegram
i
felt
sure
that
the
whole
of
my
life
happiness
was
at
stake
the
next
morning
at
nine
just
as
i
was
preparing
to
go
down
to
breakfast
a
long
wire
was
brought
to
me
it
was
in
our
own
office
cipher
which
i
was
trained
to
read
without
the
key
and
it
was
signed
by
julia
dewsbury
the
gist
of
the
message
was
that
there
were
strange
rumors
all
over
fleet
street
about
the
great
towers
at
richmond
an
enormous
sensation
was
gathering
like
a
thunder
cloud
in
the
world
of
news
and
would
shortly
burst
would
i
come
to
london
at
the
earliest
possible
moment
how
i
got
out
of
cerne
hall
i
hardly
remember
but
i
did
to
the
blank
astonishment
of
my
host
drove
to
the
nearest
station
caught
a
train
which
got
me
to
norwich
in
half
an
hour
and
engaged
the
swiftest
car
in
the
city
to
run
me
up
to
london
at
top
speed
just
after
lunch
i
burst
into
the
office
of
the
williams
and
miss
dewsbury
were
expecting
me
it
big
stuff
said
the
acting
editor
excitedly
and
we
ought
to
be
in
it
first
considering
that
we
more
definite
information
than
i
expect
any
other
paper
possesses
as
yet
though
it
wo
be
the
case
for
very
long
i
sat
down
with
hardly
a
word
and
nodded
to
miss
dewsbury
her
training
was
wonderful
she
had
everything
ready
in
order
to
acquaint
me
with
the
facts
in
the
shortest
possible
space
of
time
she
spoke
into
the
telephone
and
miss
easey
vera
of
our
society
gossip
came
in
i
have
found
out
sir
thomas
she
said
that
gideon
morse
has
canceled
all
social
engagements
whatever
for
himself
and
his
daughter
miss
dewsbury
tells
me
that
it
not
necessary
now
to
say
what
these
were
i
will
however
tell
you
that
they
extended
until
the
new
year
and
were
of
the
utmost
social
importance
canceled
miss
easey
definitely
and
finally
both
by
letter
to
the
various
hosts
and
hostesses
concerned
and
by
an
intimation
which
is
already
sent
to
all
the
london
dailies
for
publication
the
notice
came
up
to
my
room
this
morning
from
our
own
advertising
office
for
inclusion
in
notes
as
you
know
such
intimations
are
printed
as
news
and
paid
for
at
a
guinea
a
line
any
reason
given
miss
easey
none
whatever
in
the
notices
which
are
brief
almost
to
curtness
however
i
have
been
able
to
see
one
of
the
private
letters
which
has
been
received
by
my
friends
lord
and
lady
william
gatehouse
of
banks
it
is
courteously
worded
and
explains
that
and
miss
morse
are
definitely
retiring
from
social
life
it
signed
by
his
secretary
the
invaluable
julia
nodded
to
miss
easey
she
pursed
up
her
prim
old
mouth
wished
me
and
rustled
away
that
said
julia
now
about
the
towers
yes
about
the
towers
i
said
and
my
voice
was
very
hoarse
as
my
poor
friend
rolston
discovered
she
said
bravely
these
monstrous
blots
upon
london
are
certainly
not
for
the
purposes
of
wireless
telegraphy
there
are
half
the
journalists
in
london
at
richmond
at
the
present
moment
including
two
of
our
own
reporters
and
it
is
said
that
on
the
immense
platforms
between
the
towers
a
series
of
extraordinary
and
luxurious
buildings
has
been
erected
it
is
widely
believed
that
gideon
morse
is
out
of
his
mind
and
has
retired
to
a
sort
of
unassailable
luxurious
hermitage
in
the
sky
there
was
a
knock
at
the
door
and
a
came
in
with
a
long
white
strip
just
torn
from
the
tape
machine
i
took
it
and
read
that
the
central
news
agencies
announces
crowds
at
base
of
towers
surrounded
by
a
wall
callers
at
principal
gate
are
politely
received
by
boss
mulligan
formerly
boxer
united
states
now
in
the
service
of
gideon
morse
inquirers
told
that
no
statement
can
be
issued
for
publication
later
rumor
in
neighborhood
says
that
towers
are
entirely
staffed
by
special
chinese
servants
large
company
of
which
arrived
at
liverpool
on
thursday
last
growing
certainty
that
towers
are
private
enterprise
of
one
man
morse
the
brazilian
a
telephone
bell
on
my
table
rang
i
took
it
up
is
that
sir
thomas
charles
danvers
speaking
it
was
the
voice
of
our
dapper
young
parliamentary
correspondent
the
nephew
of
a
prominent
and
as
smart
as
they
make
them
yes
where
are
you
house
of
commons
bloxhame
member
for
budmouth
is
asking
a
question
in
the
house
this
afternoon
about
the
richmond
tower
sensation
the
secretary
to
the
board
of
trade
will
reply
there
great
interest
in
the
lobby
special
edition
clearly
indicated
question
will
come
on
about
four
i
sent
every
one
away
and
thought
for
a
quarter
of
an
hour
of
course
all
this
absolved
me
of
my
promise
to
morse
he
had
played
with
me
fooled
me
absolutely
and
i
had
been
like
a
babe
in
his
astute
hands
well
there
was
no
time
to
think
of
my
own
private
grievances
my
immediate
duty
was
to
make
as
good
a
show
that
afternoon
and
the
next
day
as
any
other
paper
my
hope
was
to
beat
all
my
rivals
out
of
the
field
after
all
there
were
nothing
but
rumors
and
surmise
up
to
the
present
the
news
situation
might
change
in
a
couple
of
hours
but
at
the
present
moment
i
felt
certain
that
i
knew
more
about
the
affair
than
any
other
man
in
fleet
street
i
set
my
teeth
and
resolved
to
let
old
morse
have
it
in
the
neck
within
an
hour
or
so
we
had
an
extra
edition
on
the
streets
and
during
that
hour
i
drew
on
my
own
private
knowledge
and
dictated
to
miss
dewsbury
and
a
couple
of
other
stenographers
poppy
experience
was
a
godsend
i
remembered
her
own
vivid
words
of
the
night
before
and
i
printed
them
in
the
form
of
an
interview
which
must
have
satisfied
even
that
delightful
girl
hunger
for
advertisement
incidentally
i
sent
a
man
from
the
corps
of
commissionaires
down
to
cerne
in
a
fast
with
notes
for
two
hundred
and
fifty
in
an
envelope
and
instructions
to
stop
in
regent
street
on
his
way
and
buy
the
finest
box
of
chocolates
that
london
could
produce
i
remember
the
bill
came
in
a
few
days
afterwards
and
if
you
believe
me
it
was
for
seventeen
pounds
ten
at
four
while
the
question
was
being
asked
in
the
house
of
commons
and
all
the
other
evening
papers
were
waiting
the
result
for
their
special
editions
my
extra
special
was
rushing
all
over
london
the
extra
special
containing
the
first
authentic
description
of
the
city
in
the
clouds
you
really
are
wonderful
sir
thomas
said
miss
dewsbury
removing
her
spectacles
and
touching
her
eyes
with
a
somewhat
dingy
handkerchief
but
where
oh
where
is
william
rolston
my
dear
girl
i
replied
from
what
i
seen
of
william
rolston
quite
certain
that
he
alive
and
kicking
not
only
that
but
we
shall
hear
from
him
again
very
shortly
you
really
think
so
sir
thomas
the
eyes
hitherto
concealed
by
the
spectacles
were
really
rather
fascinating
eyes
after
all
i
do
so
i
know
it
look
here
miss
dewsbury
for
some
reason
i
could
resist
the
temptation
of
a
confidence
this
thing
this
stunt
hits
me
privately
a
great
deal
harder
than
you
can
have
any
idea
of
you
said
that
the
shadow
of
the
towers
was
across
my
path
and
you
were
more
right
than
you
knew
enough
said
i
think
we
whacked
fleet
street
this
afternoon
well
and
good
there
a
lot
behind
this
momentary
sensation
which
i
shall
never
leave
go
of
until
straightened
out
this
is
between
you
and
me
not
for
office
consumption
but
i
put
my
hand
upon
her
thin
arm
if
i
can
help
in
any
way
you
shall
have
your
bill
rolston
she
turned
her
head
away
and
walked
to
the
window
then
she
said
an
astonishing
thing
if
only
i
could
help
you
to
your
juanita
what
i
shouted
what
on
earth
a
page
came
in
with
a
telegram
addressed
to
you
sir
thomas
he
said
marked
personal
i
tore
it
open
it
was
from
pat
moore
extraordinary
youth
followed
us
out
shooting
and
came
up
at
lunch
asking
for
you
boy
of
about
sixteen
mysterious
cove
with
the
assurance
of
mephistopheles
some
question
of
fifty
pounds
was
to
get
from
you
on
delivering
letter
gave
him
your
address
and
he
departed
for
london
i
could
make
head
or
tail
of
pat
wire
and
i
put
it
down
on
the
table
for
future
consideration
when
williams
hurried
in
with
a
pad
of
paper
danvers
just
through
he
said
and
i
sent
the
message
downstairs
for
the
stop
press
i
began
to
read

interrogated
secretary
to
the
board

who
replied
it
was
perfectly
true
that
the
towers
were
built
to
the
order
of
gideon
morse
and
were
his
property
morse
has
entered
into
an
agreement
with
the
government
engaging
not
to
use
the
towers
for
wireless
telegraphy
or
for
any
other
purpose
than
a
strictly
private
one
which
appears
to
be
that
he
intends
to
live
on
the
platforms
on
the
top
at
his
death
the
whole
property
will
pass
into
possession
of
the

to
be
used
for

purposes
or
for
the

station

announces
that
strict
orders
have

that

in
any
way

present
proprietor
the
house
is
greatly
amused
and
interested
at
this
romantic
news
williams
departed
to
issue
another
extra
special
and
i
was
once
more
left
alone
obviously
the
secret
was
out
it
was
startling
enough
in
all
conscience
and
as
i
thought
merely
the
whim
of
a
madman
and
yet
there
were
aspects
of
it
which
were
inexplicable
there
could
be
no
doubt
whatever
that
gideon
morse
had
flouted
english
society
which
had
treated
him
with
extreme
kindness
in
a
way
that
it
would
never
forget
that
surely
was
not
the
action
of
a
sane
man
if
he
had
wanted
to
build
for
himself
a
lordly
pleasure
house
to
which
he
might
retire
upon
occasions
a
sane
man
would
have
arranged
things
very
differently
certainly
and
this
was
not
without
some
bitter
satisfaction
to
me
he
had
ruined
his
daughter
chances
of
a
brilliant
marriage
for
a
long
time
at
any
rate
i
saw
that
secrecy
had
been
necessary
though
it
had
been
carried
to
an
extreme
degree
but
why
had
he
fooled
me
under
the
guise
of
friendship
surely
he
could
have
trusted
my
word
i
was
furious
as
i
thought
of
the
way
i
had
been
done
i
was
furious
also
and
worse
than
furious
alarmed
when
i
thought
of
juanita
had
she
been
in
the
plot
the
whole
time
did
she
like
being
spirited
away
from
all
that
could
make
a
young
girl
life
bright
and
happy
what
at
the
bottom
of
it
all
the
only
thing
to
do
was
to
try
and
keep
ahead
or
level
with
my
rival
contemporaries
in
the
matter
of
news
and
privately
to
wait
on
events
and
think
the
matter
out
definitely
for
the
next
few
days
weeks
perhaps
some
of
the
acutest
brains
in
england
would
be
puzzled
over
this
problem
and
if
there
was
really
anything
more
in
it
than
the
freak
of
a
colossal
egotist
who
thus
with
a
superb
gesture
signified
his
scorn
of
the
world
then
some
light
might
come
suddenly
i
felt
ill
and
collapsed
i
gave
a
few
instructions
left
the
office
and
went
home
to
piccadilly
and
to
bed
it
was
about
eight
when
preston
woke
me
i
had
had
a
bath
and
changed
and
was
wondering
exactly
what
i
should
do
for
the
rest
of
the
evening
when
preston
came
in
and
said
that
there
was
a
boy
who
wished
to
see
me
he
would
neither
give
his
name
nor
his
business
but
seemed
respectable
i
remembered
pat
mysterious
telegram
which
till
now
i
had
quite
forgotten
and
with
a
certain
quickening
of
the
pulses
i
ordered
the
boy
to
be
shown
up
he
came
into
the
room
with
a
scrape
and
a
bow
a
lad
of
sixteen
decently
dressed
in
black
who
are
you
and
what
do
you
want
i
said
he
seemed
a
little
nervous
and
his
eyes
were
bright
are
you
sir
thomas
kirby
yes
what
is
it
by
the
way
have
you
been
all
the
way
to
norfolk
to
find
me
yes
sir
it
my
day
off
but
unfortunately
i
found
you
had
left
sir
so
i
came
on
here
as
fast
as
i
could
a
gentleman
at
cerne
hall
gave
me
your
address
and
how
did
you
know
i
was
at
cerne
hall
it
on
the
envelope
sir
the
envelope
yes
sir
the
one
i
was
to
deliver
to
you
personally
and
on
no
account
to
let
it
get
into
the
hands
of
any
one
else
even
one
of
your
servants
sir
and
he
breathed
a
little
fast
and
the
lady
said
that
you
would
certainly
give
me
fifty
pounds
sir
if
i
did
exactly
as
she
ordered
and
never
breathed
a
word
to
a
single
soul
in
an
instant
i
understood
the
blood
grew
hot
and
raced
into
my
veins
as
i
held
out
my
hand
trembling
with
impatience
while
the
youth
performed
a
somewhat
complicated
operation
of
half
undressing
eventually
producing
a
brown
paper
packet
intricately
tied
with
string
from
some
inner
recesses
of
his
wardrobe
who
are
you
i
asked
while
he
was
unbuttoning
james
smith
sir
one
of
the
pages
at
the
ritz
hotel
i
tore
off
the
wrappers
imposed
upon
the
letter
by
this
cautious
youth
there
was
a
letter
addressed
to
me
in
a
fine
italian
hand
which
i
knew
from
having
seen
it
in
one
word
only
cerne
fortunately
i
had
plenty
of
money
in
the
flat
and
there
was
no
need
to
give
the
excellent
james
smith
a
check
he
gasped
with
joy
as
he
tucked
away
the
crackling
bits
of
paper
and
remember
not
ever
a
word
to
any
one
smith
on
my
honor
sir
he
said
saluting
and
what
will
you
do
with
it
smith
please
sir
i
hope
to
pelmanize
myself
into
an
hotel
manager
he
said
and
i
let
him
go
at
that
i
only
hope
that
he
will
succeed
i
opened
the
letter
it
ran
as
follows
farewell
i
do
suppose
we
shall
ever
meet
again
i
am
forced
to
retire
from
the
world
from
love
from
you
i
can
not
explain
but
fear
walks
with
me
night
and
day
oh
my
love
if
you
could
only
save
me
you
would
i
know
but
it
is
impossible
and
so
farewell
were
i
not
sure
that
we
shall
not
see
each
other
more
i
could
not
write
as
i
have
done
and
signed
myself
here
your
juanita
i
put
the
letter
carefully
into
the
of
my
coat
and
then
for
the
first
time
in
my
life
i
fainted
dead
away
preston
found
me
a
few
minutes
later
got
me
right
somehow
ascertained
that
i
had
not
eaten
for
many
hours
scolded
me
like
a
father
and
poured
turtle
soup
into
me
till
i
was
alive
again
alive
and
changed
from
the
man
i
had
been
a
few
hours
ago
the
next
day
i
satisfied
myself
that
all
was
going
well
in
the
office
and
simply
roamed
about
london
already
i
think
the
dim
purpose
which
afterwards
came
to
such
extraordinary
fruit
was
being
born
in
my
mind
i
wanted
to
be
alone
taken
quite
out
of
my
usual
surroundings
and
i
achieved
this
with
considerable
success
i
rode
in
tube
trains
and
heard
every
one
discussing
gideon
morse
and
what
was
already
known
as
the
city
in
the
clouds
the
papers
announced
that
thousands
of
people
were
encamped
in
richmond
park
gazing
upwards
and
seeing
nothing
because
of
a
cloud
veil
that
hung
around
the
top
of
the
towers
it
seemed
the
proprietors
of
telescopes
on
tripods
were
doing
a
roaring
trade
at
threepence
a
look
but
the
gate
in
the
grim
walls
surrounding
the
grounds
at
the
foot
of
the
tower
was
never
once
opened
all
day
long
i
began
to
realize
that
probably
nothing
new
nothing
reliable
that
is
would
transpire
at
present
the
sensation
would
go
its
usual
way
there
would
be
songs
and
allusions
in
all
the
revues
punch
would
have
a
cartoon
suggesting
the
city
in
the
clouds
as
a
place
of
banishment
for
its
particular
bugbear
of
the
moment
gossip
papers
would
be
full
of
beautiful
untrue
stories
of
a
romantic
nature
about
the
girl
i
loved
her
name
would
be
the
subject
of
a
million
jokes
by
a
million
vulgar
people
then
little
by
little
the
excitement
would
die
away
all
this
as
a
trained
journalist
i
foresaw
easily
enough
but
knowing
what
i
knew
what
probably
i
alone
of
all
the
teeming
millions
in
london
knew
i
was
forming
a
resolve
which
hourly
grew
stronger
that
i
would
never
rest
until
i
knew
the
worst
i
found
myself
in
kensington
there
was
a
starting
for
whitechapel
road
i
climbed
on
the
top
i
sye
piped
a
little
ragamuffin
office
boy
to
his
friend
why
does
jewanniter
live
in
the
clouds
willum
arsk
me
another
she
a
celebrated
see
what
i
say
said
a
man
with
a
bristling
mustache
which
unsuccessfully
concealed
his
slack
and
feeble
mouth
is
simply
this
if
morse
chooses
to
live
in
a
certain
way
of
life
and
the
money
to
carry
it
out
why
not
let
him
alone
freedom
for
every
individual
is
a
of
english
life
and
i
expect
morse
is
fair
furious
with
what
they
saying
about
him
for
i
have
it
on
the
best
authority
that
a
copy
of
every
edition
of
the
goes
up
to
him
in
the
tower
lifts
as
soon
as
it
is
issued
words
words
words
everywhere
silly
irresponsible
chatter
which
i
heeded
as
little
as
a
thrush
heeds
a
shower
of
rain
steadily
swiftly
certainly
my
purpose
grew
i
got
down
in
the
whitechapel
road
that
wide
and
unlovely
thoroughfare
and
feeling
hungry
went
into
a
dingy
little
restaurant
partitioned
off
in
boxes
the
tablecloth
was
of
stained
oil
skin
the
guests
the
seediest
type
of
minor
clerks
but
i
do
remember
that
for
ninepence
i
had
a
little
beefsteak
and
kidney
pudding
to
myself
which
was
as
good
as
anything
i
have
ever
eaten
as
i
went
out
i
saw
my
neighbor
of
the
omnibus
who
had
spoken
so
eloquently
of
freedom
walking
by
with
a
little
black
bag
as
in
an
aimless
way
i
hailed
a
taxicab
from
the
rank
opposite
a
london
hospital
and
told
the
man
to
drive
slowly
westwards
he
did
so
and
when
we
came
to
the
embankment
a
gleam
of
afternoon
sunshine
began
to
enlighten
what
had
been
a
leaden
day
thinking
a
brisk
walk
from
black
friars
to
westminster
would
help
my
thoughts
i
dismissed
the
cab
and
started
it
was
with
an
odd
little
thrill
and
flutter
of
the
heart
that
far
away
westwards
to
the
left
of
the
houses
of
parliament
i
saw
three
ghostly
lines
no
thicker
than
lamp
posts
it
seemed
springing
upwards
from
nothingness
at
cleopatra
needle
i
felt
the
want
of
a
cigarette
and
stopped
to
light
one
at
the
moment
there
were
few
people
on
the
pavement
though
the
unceasing
traffic
in
the
road
roared
by
as
usual
i
lit
the
cigarette
put
my
case
back
in
my
pocket
and
was
about
to
continue
my
stroll
when
i
heard
some
one
padding
up
behind
me
with
obvious
purpose
i
half
turned
and
there
again
i
saw
the
man
with
the
weak
mouth
and
the
big
mustache
it
flashed
upon
me
for
the
first
time
that
i
was
being
followed
had
been
followed
probably
during
the
whole
of
my
wanderings
as
i
said
there
was
nobody
immediately
about
so
i
turned
to
and
challenged
him
you
following
me
my
man
why
out
with
it
or
i
give
you
in
charge
yer
ca
he
said
this
is
a
free
country
freedom
is
my
as
well
as
yerself
sir
thomas
kirby
i
done
nothing
to
annoy
yer
have
i
i
shrugged
my
shoulders
but
you
have
been
following
me
his
manner
changed
at
once
ever
since
you
left
piccadilly
sir
thomas
waiting
my
opportunity
a
private
inquiry
agent
by
profession
though
this
job
of
shadowing
you
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
office
that
employs
me
i
have
a
young
friend
in
my
house
who
turned
up
sudden
and
mysterious
a
young
friend
i
lost
sight
of
many
weeks
ago
he
says
you
come
to
him
at
once
if
i
could
only
get
you
alone
and
be
certain
that
no
one
saw
me
speak
to
you
his
instructions
were
to
follow
you
about
until
such
an
opportunity
as
this
arose
and
all
the
time
i
was
to
be
certain
that
no
one
else
was
following
you
i
have
ascertained
that
all
right
he
put
his
head
close
to
mine
and
i
felt
his
hot
breath
upon
my
cheek
it

morning

following

all

he
shook
his
head

have
done
rolston
instructions
was
different
and
he
has
his
reasons
though
i
not
in
his
confidence
i
done
it
out
of
admiration
for
his
talents
and

doubt

in
a
position
to
pay

for
my
work
pay
you
you
idiot
i
could
have
taken
him
by
the
throat
and
shaken
the
fool
rolston
knows
very
well
that
he
can
command
any
money
he
chooses
he
a
member
of
my
staff
we
were
now
walking
along
together
towards
westminster
that
as
may
be
said
my
seedy
friend
but
a
brass
farthing
this
morning
and
come
to
that
sir
thomas
if
you
got
into
another
blinking
taxi
you
have
snookered
where
do
you
live
i
asked
impatiently
not
far
from
where
you
your
lunch
sir
thomas
imperial
mansions
royal
road
stepney
it
a
magnificent
address
i
said
as
i
held
out
my
stick
for
a
cab
it
a
block
o
workmen
buildings
reely
he
replied
gloomily
and
in
the
thick
of
the
chinese
quarter
which
makes
it
none
too
savory
but
an
englishman
house
is
his
castle
and
he
has
the
to
call
it
what
he
likes
back
east
we
went
again
and
in
half
an
hour
i
was
mounting
interminable
stone
steps
to
a
door
nearly
at
the
top
of
imperial
mansions
which
my
guide
who
during
our
drive
had
introduced
himself
to
me
as
herbert
sliddim
announced
as
his
home
in
a
dingily
furnished
room
sitting
on
a
molting
plush
sofa
i
saw
the
curious
little
man
to
whom
i
had
so
taken
months
ago
he
was
shabby
almost
to
beggary
his
face
was
pale
and
worn
which
gave
him
an
aspect
of
being
much
older
than
i
had
imagined
him
but
his
irrepressible
ears
stood
out
as
of
yore
and
his
eyes
were
not
dimmed
hallo
i
said
glad
to
see
you
rolston
though
you
neglected
us
at
the
office
for
a
long
time
your
arrears
of
salary
have
been
mounting
up
his
hand
was
trembling
as
i
gripped
it
oh
sir
thomas
he
said
do
you
really
mean
that
i
am
still
on
the
staff
of
course
you
are
my
dear
boy
i
turned
to
sliddim
now
i
wonder
i
said
if
i
might
have
a
little
quiet
conversation
with
mr
rolston
by
all
means
he
replied
i
wait
in
the
courtyard
i
should
do
that
sliddim
why
not
take
a
tour
round
i
led
him
out
of
the
room
into
the
passage
which
served
for
hall
pressed
a
couple
of
pounds
into
his
hand
and
had
the
satisfaction
of
seeing
him
leap
away
down
the
stairs
like
an
antelope
that
all
right
said
rolston
now
he
go
and
get
blotto
it
the
poor
devil
failing
still
he
be
happy
i
sat
down
passed
my
cigarette
case
to
rolston
and
waited
for
him
to
begin
he
sort
of
came
to
attention
i
was
rung
up
sir
thomas
at
your
flat
at
least
your
valet
was
and
told
to
come
to
the
office
of
the
at
once
i
know
go
on
i
dressed
as
quickly
as
i
could
ran
down
the
stairs
and
jumped
into
the
waiting
cab
the
door
banged
and
we
started
off
the
engines
must
have
been
running
for
we
went
away
like
a
flash
there
was
some
one
else
sitting
there
a
hand
clapped
over
my
mouth
and
an
arm
round
my
body
i
could
move
or
speak
then
the
thumb
of
the
hand
did
something
to
the
big
nerves
behind
my
ear
it
an
oriental
trick
and
i
had
just
realized
it
when
something
wet
and
sweet
was
pressed
over
my
mouth
and
nose
and
i
lost
all
consciousness
when
i
woke
up
i
found
myself
in
a
room
lit
by
a
skylight
high
up
in
the
roof
there
was
a
bed
a
table
a
chair
and
various
other
conveniences
and
i
had
the
slightest
idea
where
i
could
be
my
head
ached
and
i
felt
bruised
all
over
so
i
drank
a
glass
of
water
crawled
back
into
the
bed
and
slept
when
i
woke
again
there
was
an
affable
chink
sitting
by
my
side
who
spoke
quite
good
english
will
he
said
kept
here
for
some
time
in
durance
yess
an
unfortunate
necessity
yess
i
heard
on
all
sides
familiar
noises
i
knew
in
a
moment
what
had
happened
i
had
been
brought
back
to
the
works
at
the
base
of
the
three
towers
all
this
fits
in
very
well
with
what
i
now
know
rolston
i
tell
you
everything
in
a
minute
but
i
want
to
hear
your
story
first
very
good
sir
thomas
for
over
three
months
i
been
kept
a
prisoner
at
richmond
i
was
badly
treated
i
had
anything
i
liked
to
eat
and
drink
any
books
to
read
tobacco
a
bath
everything
but
newspapers
which
were
rigidly
denied
me
i
was
kept
entirely
to
my
prison
room
i
was
allowed
to
go
out
and
take
exercise
within
the
domain
surrounded
by
the
great
wall
though
i
was
never
let
to
roam
about
as
i
wished
there
was
always
a
big
chinese
coolie
with
a
leaded
cane
attending
me
a
man
that
only
spoke
a
few
words
of
english
now
sir
thomas
please
remember
this
from
first
to
last
none
of
my
jailers
knew
that
i
understood
chinese
and
none
of
them
knew
or
suspected
that
i
had
been
among
the
workmen
before
in
order
to
get
materials
for
the
scoop
with
which
i
came
to
you
i
saw
the
value
of
that
at
once
good
for
you
rolston
now
please
continue
well
sir
thomas
i
kept
my
eyes
and
ears
very
wide
open
and
i
learnt
a
lot
things
were
being
prepared
with
a
feverish
activity
of
which
the
people
outside
had
not
the
slightest
idea
i
found
that
round
the
base
of
the
towers
in
the
miniature
park
inclosed
by
the
high
wall
there
were
already
magnificent
vegetable
gardens
in
active
being
there
were
huge
conservatories
which
must
have
been
set
up
when
the
towers
were
only
a
few
hundred
feet
high
now
full
of
the
rarest
flowers
and
shrubs
in
my
walks
i
saw
a
miniature
poultry
farm
conducted
on
the
most
methods
there
was
a
dairy
with
four
or
five
cows
already
this
part
of
the
huge
inclosure
was
assuming
a
rural
aspect
it
must
have
been
planned
and
started
nearly
two
years
ago
you
asked
questions
i
suppose
any
amount
as
innocently
as
i
possibly
could
i
got
very
little
out
of
my
captors
in
reply
your
chinaman
is
the
most
secretive
person
in
the
world
i
heard
them
talking
among
themselves
and
i
was
amazed
at
the
calculated
organization
which
had
been
going
on
without
cessation
from
the
beginning
it
all
fitted
in
exactly
with
what
i
told
you
at
the
office
it
was
as
though
morse
was
planning
a
little
private
world
of
his
own
which
would
be
independent
of
everything
outside
and
about
the
towers
themselves
it
will
take
me
hours
to
tell
you
in
one
quarter
of
the
inclosure
there
are
great
dynamo
sheds
an
electric
installation
inferior
to
nothing
else
of
its
kind
in
the
world
the
great
lifts
which
rise
and
fall
in
the
towers
are
electric
heating
lighting
artificial
daylight
for
the
conservatories
all
are
electric
where
i
was
kept
he
went
on
was
nearly
a
quarter
of
a
mile
from
the
engineering
section
but
i
knew
that
it
hummed
with
extraordinary
activity
night
and
day
i
discovered
that
structural
buildings
of
light
steel
were
pouring
in
from
america
that
an
army
of
decorators
and
painters
was
at
work
vans
of
priceless
oriental
furniture
and
hangings
were
arriving
from
all
parts
of
the
world
rare
flowers
and
shrubs
also
sir
thomas
it
was
as
though
the
universe
was
being
searched
for
wonders
all
to
be
concentrated
here
this
went
on
and
on
till
i
lost
count
of
the
days
and
lived
in
a
sort
of
dream
kindly
treated
enough
allowed
to
see
many
secret
things
and
always
with
a
sense
that
because
this
was
so
i
should
never
again
emerge
into
the
real
world
i
can
understand
that
rolston
every
word
you
say
interests
me
extremely
i
come
to
the
present
sir
thomas
you
can
ask
me
any
details
that
you
like
afterwards
a
few
days
ago
everything
was
speeded
up
to
extraordinary
pitch
then
late
one
night
there
was
a
great
and
in
the
morning
i
learned
that
morse
and
his
family
had
arrived
and
that
they
were
up
at
the
top
i
have
found
out
since
that
this
was
the
fourteenth
of
september
the
fourteenth
i
cried
yes
sir
thomas
the
fourteenth
the
next
day
it
was
late
in
the
afternoon
and
the
sun
was
setting
two
chinamen
came
into
my
room
tied
a
handkerchief
over
my
eyes
and
led
me
out
i
was
put
into
one
of
the
little
electric
railways
open
cars
which
run
all
over
the
inclosure
and
taken
to
the
base
of
the
towers
i
do
know
which
tower
it
was
but
i
was
led
into
a
lift
and
a
long
slow
ascent
began
i
knew
that
i
was
in
one
of
the
big
carrying
lifts
that
take
a
long
time
to
do
the
third
of
a
mile
up
to
the
city
not
one
of
the
elevators
which
leap
upwards
from
stage
to
stage
for
passengers
and
arrive
at
the
top
in
a
comparatively
short
space
of
time
when
the
lift
stopped
they
took
off
the
handkerchief
and
i
found
myself
in
a
great
whitewashed
barn
of
a
place
which
was
obviously
a
storeroom
there
were
bales
of
stuff
huge
boxes
and
barrels
on
every
side
the
men
who
had
brought
me
up
were
just
rough
chinese
workmen
from
hong
kong
but
a
door
opened
and
a
chink
of
quite
another
sort
came
in
and
took
me
by
the
arm
you
see
sir
thomas
he
explained
to
the
ordinary
englishman
one
chinaman
is
just
like
another
but
my
experience
in
the
east
enables
me
to
distinguish
at
once
the
newcomer
was
of
a
very
superior
class
and
he
led
me
out
of
the
storeroom
across
a
swaying
bridge
of
latticed
steel
to
a
little
rotunda
as
we
passed
along
i
had
a
glimpse
of
the
whole
of
london
far
far
below
the
thames
was
like
a
piece
of
glittering
string
everything
else
were
simply
patches
of
gray
green
and
brown
we
went
into
the
cupola
and
a
tiny
lift
shot
us
up
like
a
bullet
until
it
stopped
with
a
clank
and
i
knew
that
i
was
now
upon
the
highest
platform
of
all
but
i
could
see
nothing
for
we
simply
turned
down
a
long
corridor
lighted
by
electricity
and
softly
carpeted
which
might
have
been
the
corridor
of
one
of
the
great
hotels
far
down
below
in
town
my
conductor
who
wore
and
a
suit
of
dark
blue
alpaca
and
who
had
a
charming
smile
stopped
at
a
door
rapped
and
pushed
me
in
i
found
myself
in
a
room
of
considerable
size
it
was
a
library
the
walls
were
covered
with
shelves
of
old
oak
in
which
there
were
innumerable
books
a
turkey
carpet
two
or
three
and
gideon
morse
whom
i
had
never
spoken
to
but
had
seen
driving
in
hyde
park
sat
there
smoking
a
cigar
i
might
have
been
in
the
library
of
a
country
house
except
for
two
things
there
were
no
windows
to
this
large
and
gracious
room
it
was
lit
from
above
like
a
domed
skylights
in
the
roof
but
the
light
that
came
down
was
not
a
light
like
anything
i
had
ever
seen
it
lit
up
every
detail
of
the
magnificent
and
stately
place
but
it
was
new
light
that
never
was
on
earth
or
sea
it
was
just
that
that
made
me
realize
where
i
was
two
thousand
three
hundred
feet
up
in
the
air
alone
with
gideon
morse
who
had
snatched
me
out
of
life
three
months
before
i
know
morse
rolston
what
impression
did
he
make
on
you
for
a
moment
he
stunned
me
sir
thomas
i
knew
i
was
in
the
presence
of
a
superman
all
that
i
had
heard
about
him
all
the
legends
that
surrounded
his
name
the
fact
of
this
stupendous
sky
city
in
which
i
was
the
ease
with
which
he
had
stretched
out
his
hand
and
made
me
a
prisoner
all
combined
to
produce
awe
and
fear
yes
go
on
i
saw
two
other
things
i
think
i
did
one
was
that
the
man
sanity
is
trembling
in
the
balance
the
other
that
if
ever
a
human
being
lives
and
moves
and
has
his
being
in
deadly
temporal
fear
gideon
mendoza
morse
is
that
man
the
words
rang
out
in
that
room
with
prophetic
force
it
was
as
though
a
brilliant
light
was
snapped
on
to
illumine
a
dark
chamber
in
my
soul
what
did
he
say
to
you
rolston
he
was
suavity
and
kindness
itself
he
said
that
he
immensely
regretted
the
necessity
for
secluding
me
so
long
of
course
i
shall
make
it
up
to
you
you
a
young
man
rolston
only
just
commencing
your
career
a
little
capital
would
doubtless
assist
that
career
in
which
i
may
say
i
have
every
belief
shall
we
say
that
you
leave
richmond
this
afternoon
with
a
solatium
of
five
hundred
pounds
thousand
would
suit
me
better
i
said
he
shrugged
his
shoulders
and
suddenly
smiled
at
me
well
he
said
it
be
a
thousand
pounds
course
without
prejudice
mr
morse
explain
yourself
kidnaped
me
you
also
committed
an
offense
against
the
law
of
england
a
criminal
offense
for
which
you
will
have
to
suffer
perhaps
you
do
realize
that
if
you
built
your
house
miles
further
up
if
you
managed
to
nearly
reach
the
moon
british
justice
would
reach
you
at
last
he
shook
his
head
sadly
that
point
of
view
i
hardly
agree
rolston
i
am
quite
unable
to
purchase
british
justice
but
i
can
put
such
obstacles
in
its
way
that
could
he
suddenly
stopped
there
lit
a
little
brown
cigarette
came
up
and
patted
me
on
the
shoulder
he
said
are
clever
you
are
original
i
like
you
but
have
a
sense
of
proportion
and
remember
that
you
have
no
choice
in
this
matter
i
will
give
you
the
money
you
want
on
condition
that
you
go
away
and
bring
no
action
whatever
against
me
if
not
not
sir
you
will
have
to
stay
here
that
all
you
wo
be
badly
treated
you
can
be
librarian
if
you
like
but
you
will
never
see
the
outside
world
again
i
have
a
few
hours
to
consider
sir
month
if
you
like
he
said
pressing
a
bell
upon
his
table
the
same
bland
young
chinaman
led
me
out
of
the
library
and
down
to
the
storeroom
in
the
lift
i
was
blindfolded
and
descended
to
the
ground
there
i
met
a
man
whom
i
had
seen
two
or
three
times
during
the
last
three
days
a
great
american
with
arms
like
a
gorilla
a
thing
called
mulligan
whom
i
had
gathered
from
the
conversation
of
my
chinese
friends
had
now
arrived
to
take
charge
of
the
whole
city
a
sort
of
head
policeman
and
guard
he
said
had
a
down
from
the
top
in
regard
to
you
now
do
you
be
a
short
sport
you
been
made
a
good
offer
you
grip
it
and
be
like
fat
in
lavender
my
advice
to
you
is
to
wind
a
smile
round
your
neck
and
depart
with
the
dollars
i
can
see
you
full
of
pep
and
now
you
got
fortune
before
you
see
that
pavilion
over
there
he
pointed
to
where
a
little
gaudily
painted
house
nestled
under
one
of
the
great
feet
of
the
first
tower
my
mansion
you
wander
about
for
an
hour
or
so
and
come
there
and
say
you
agree
to
the
boss
terms
we
take
your
word
for
it
upon
the
word
yes
i
hand
you
out
at
the
gate
and
you
can
go
to
paris
for
a
trip
think
it
over
i
said
so
and
do
be
a
damn
fool
it
was
getting
dusk
i
was
in
a
new
part
of
the
inclosed
park
he
let
me
go
without
any
watchful
chinese
attendant
at
my
heels
and
i
strolled
off
with
my
head
bent
down
as
if
deep
in
thought
i
got
an
hour
and
i
think
i
made
the
best
use
of
it
i
hurried
along
under
the
shadow
of
the
towers
past
shrubberies
artificial
lakes
and
little
inclosed
until
i
was
far
away
from
mulligan
here
and
there
i
passed
a
patient
chinese
gardener
or
some
hurrying
member
of
morse
little
army
but
nobody
stopped
me
or
interfered
with
me
for
the
first
time
since
my
captivity
i
was
perfectly
free
to
cut
a
long
story
short
sir
thomas
i
came
to
a
rectangle
in
the
great
encircling
wall
which
at
that
point
was
thirty
feet
high
the
parapet
at
the
top
was
obviously
being
repaired
for
there
was
a
ladder
right
up
pails
of
mortar
bricklayers
tools
and
a
coil
of
rope
for
binding
scaffolding
i
nipped
up
the
ladder
carrying
the
rope
after
me
fixed
it
at
the
top
slid
down
easily
enough
and
in
a
quarter
of
an
hour
was
in
richmond
station
i
did
dare
to
go
back
to
my
old
rooms
because
i
was
sure
there
would
be
a
secret
hue
and
cry
after
me
i
thought
of
my
old
friend
sliddim
traveled
to
whitechapel
with
my
last
pence
and
here
i
am
still
a
member
of
my
staff
if
you
please
sir
thomas
ready
for
anything
anything
and
everything
then
come
with
me
to
piccadilly
if
they
look
for
you
there
again
we
shall
be
prepared
chapter
seven
i
have
to
tell
of
a
brief
interlude
before
i
got
to
work
in
earnest
the
very
day
after
the
rediscovery
of
rolston
i
fell
ill
the
strain
had
been
too
much
a
severe
nervous
attack
was
the
result
and
my
vet
ordered
me
to
the
quietest
in
brittany
that
i
could
find
i
protested
but
in
vain
the
big
man
told
me
what
would
happen
if
i
did
go
so
i
went
and
took
rolston
with
me
i
acquainted
arthur
winstanley
and
pat
moore
of
my
movements
by
letter
and
i
engaged
the
seedy
sliddim
to
abide
permanently
in
richmond
and
to
forward
me
a
full
report
of
all
he
observed
and
of
all
rumors
connected
with
the
city
in
the
clouds
when
i
had
subscribed
to
a
agency
to
send
me
everything
that
appeared
in
print
relating
to
gideon
morse
and
his
fantastic
home
i
felt
i
had
done
everything
possible
until
i
should
be
restored
to
health
of
my
month
in
pont
aven
i
shall
say
nothing
save
that
i
lived
on
fine
breton
fare
walked
ten
miles
a
day
left
rolston
who
proved
the
most
interesting
and
stimulating
companion
a
man
could
have
to
answer
all
my
letters
and
went
to
bed
at
nine
at
night
heartache
fear
for
juanita
occasional
fits
of
fury
at
my
own
inaction
and
impotence
yes
all
these
were
with
me
at
times
but
i
crushed
them
down
forced
myself
to
think
as
little
as
possible
of
her
in
order
that
when
once
restored
to
health
and
full
command
of
my
nerves
i
might
begin
the
campaign
i
had
planned
you
must
picture
me
therefore
one
afternoon
at
the
end
of
october
arriving
from
paris
by
the
five
train
dispatching
rolston
to
piccadilly
with
the
luggage
and
driving
myself
to
captain
moore
quarters
at
knightsbridge
barracks
i
had
summoned
a
meeting
of
our
league
which
we
had
so
fancifully
named
santa
hermandad
a
fact
that
was
to
have
future
consequences
which
none
of
us
ever
dreamed
of
by
telegram
from
paris
pat
and
arthur
were
awaiting
me
in
the
former
comfortable
a
warm
fire
burned
on
the
hearth
as
we
sat
down
to
tea
and
anchovy
toast
i
had
been
in
more
or
less
frequent
communication
with
both
of
them
during
my
sick
leave
and
when
we
began
to
discuss
the
situation
we
dispensed
with
preliminaries
it
was
pat
who
so
to
speak
took
the
chair
leaning
against
an
old
welsh
sideboard
of
oak
crowded
with
polo
and
shooting
cups
shields
for
swordsmanship
and
other
trophies
now
you
two
he
said
we
know
certain
facts
and
we
have
arrived
at
certain
conclusions
first
of
all
as
to
the
facts
miss
morse
is
as
good
as
engaged
to
tom
here
arthur
and
i
are
ran
fact
number
one
fact
number
two
she
has
been
suddenly
and
forcibly
taken
away
from
the
world
and
is
in
great
distress
of
mind
that
so
brother
leaguers
we
murmured
assent
now
for
our
deductions
morse
divil
take
him
has
some
deadly
important
reason
for
this
fantastic
spectacular
show
of
his
the
public
see
it
as
the
fancy
of
a
chap
who
so
much
money
he
do
know
what
to
do
with
it
a
fellow
that
exhausted
all
sensation
and
is
now
trying
for
a
new
one
let
think
so
but
know
here
in
this
room
a
long
sight
more
than
the
general
public
knows
tom
and
that
young
with
the
red
hair
and
the
ears
been
cartin
about
with
him
have
got
behind
the
scenes
pat
face
hardened
we
alone
are
certain
that
the
man
morse
for
all
his
equanimity
and
the
mask
he
has
presented
to
london
during
the
season
has
been
living
under
the
influence
of
some
dirty
cowardly
fear
or
other
arthur
interrupted
fear
if
you
like
pat
but
i
do
think
it
is
probably
dirty
or
even
cowardly
you
forget
miss
morse
perhaps
you
right
at
any
rate
if
gideon
morse
is
really
menaced
by
some
great
danger
what
cleverer
trick
could
he
have
played
to
let
the
world
suppose
that
it
his
whim
and
fancy
to
live
like
a
rook
at
the
top
of
an
elm
tree
when
all
the
time
he
providing
against
the
possibility
of
annihilation
that
a
stroke
of
genius
good
for
you
pat
said
arthur
with
a
wink
to
me
you
on
the
track
of
it
indeed
and
i
think
i
am
said
the
big
guardsman
simply
and
the
cunning
of
it
the
supreme
sense
of
if
that
man
morse
is
in
fear
of
his
life
and
in
fear
for
his
daughter
too
he
could
have
invented
a
more
perfect
security
than
he
has
done
from
all
we
know
from
all
tom
has
told
us
no
one
can
get
at
them
now
but
an
archangel
then
arthur
spoke
for
my
part
he
said
as
i
vowed
to
the
service
i
going
straight
to
brazil
and
i
going
to
find
out
everything
i
can
about
the
past
life
of
gideon
morse
i
speak
spanish
as
you
know
i
think
i
fairly
diplomatic
and
in
a
little
more
than
a
couple
of
months
i
return
with
big
news
if
i
not
very
much
mistaken
and
there
always
the
cable
too
we
are
pledged
to
tom
but
beyond
that
we
united
together
to
save
the
little
lady
from
evil
or
from
harm
i
sail
for
rio
and
i
i
said
have
already
made
my
plans
i
disappear
absolutely
from
ordinary
life
only
two
people
in
london
will
know
where
i
am
and
what
i
am
doing
preston
my
servant
in
piccadilly
and
one
other
whom
i
shall
appoint
at
the
offices
of
my
paper
while
arthur
is
gathering
information
which
will
be
of
the
greatest
use
i
must
be
working
on
the
spot
i
imagine
there
is
much
time
to
lose
and
what
i
do
asked
pat
moore
you
pat
will
stay
here
lead
your
ordinary
life
and
hold
yourself
ready
for
anything
and
everything
when
i
call
upon
you
and
as
far
as
i
can
see
i
concluded
there
will
be
a
very
pressing
necessity
for
your
help
before
much
more
water
has
flowed
under
richmond
bridge
there
was
an
end
of
talking
we
were
all
in
deadly
earnest
we
grasped
hands
arranged
a
system
of
communication
and
then
i
and
arthur
went
down
the
stone
steps
across
the
parade
ground
and
said
at
hyde
park
corner
you
he
said
you
will
see
in
the
papers
that
sir
thomas
kirby
is
gone
for
a
voyage
round
the
world
and
as
a
matter
of
fact
i
think
i
wo
give
you
any
details
old
man
my
plan
is
a
very
odd
one
indeed
you
would
quite
understand
and
you
think
it
extraordinary
as
indeed
it
is
it
ca
be
more
fantastic
than
the
whole
bitter
business
he
said
and
his
voice
was
full
of
pain
i
saw
for
the
first
time
that
he
had
grown
older
in
the
last
few
months
the
boyishness
in
him
which
had
been
one
of
his
charms
was
passing
away
definitely
and
forever
he
was
hard
hit
as
we
all
were
and
i
reproached
myself
for
my
egotism
after
all
if
there
was
any
hope
at
all
i
was
the
most
fortunate
arthur
and
staunch
old
pat
moore
were
giving
up
their
time
their
energies
to
bring
about
a
conclusion
from
which
i
alone
should
benefit
we
were
crossing
the
green
park
as
this
was
borne
in
upon
me
it
was
a
dull
gray
afternoon
rapidly
deadening
into
evening
there
seemed
no
color
anywhere
but
when
i
thought
of
the
faithful
uncomplaining
even
joyous
adherence
to
our
oath
when
i
understood
for
the
first
time
how
these
two
friends
of
mine
were
laboring
without
hope
of
reward
then
i
saw
as
in
a
vision
the
wonder
and
sacredness
of
unselfish
love
arthur
i
said
as
we
were
about
to
part
at
hyde
park
corner
god
forgive
me
but
i
believe
your
love
for
her
is
greater
than
mine
do
say
that
tom
when
we
threw
the
dice
if
the
queen
had
come
to
me
you
would
be
doing
what
i
am
doing
now
or
what
pat
is
ready
to
do
well
of
course
that
was
true
but
when
we
gripped
hands
and
turned
our
backs
upon
each
other
i
walked
slowly
towards
my
flat
with
a
hanging
head
for
one
brief
moment
i
had
caught
a
glimpse
of
that
love
which
dante
speaks
of
that
love
which
moves
earth
and
all
the
stars
and
in
the
presence
of
so
high
a
thing
i
was
bowed
and
humbled
let
me
also
be
worthy
of
such
company
was
my
prayer
at
ten
the
next
morning
i
stood
in
my
bedroom
with
preston
in
attendance
preston
face
usually
a
mask
which
showed
nothing
of
his
feelings
was
gravely
distressed
shall
i
do
preston
i
asked
yes
sir
thomas
you
he
said
regretfully
but
i
must
say
sir
thomas
that
shut
up
preston
you
said
quite
enough
am
i
the
real
thing
or
not
certainly
not
sir
thomas
he
said
with
spirit
how
could
you
be
the
real
thing
but
i
bound
to
say
you
it
you
mean
that
your
experience
of
a
small
but
prosperous
suburban
visited
principally
by
small
tradespeople
leads
you
to
suppose
that
i
might
pass
very
well
for
the
landlord
of
such
a
place
i
am
afraid
it
does
sir
thomas
he
replied
with
a
gulp
as
i
surveyed
myself
once
more
in
the
long
mirror
of
my
wardrobe
door
i
was
about
six
feet
high
in
my
boots
fair
with
a
ruddy
countenance
and
somewhat
fleshy
face
not
gross
i
believe
but
generally
built
upon
a
generous
scale
that
morning
i
had
shaved
off
my
mustache
had
my
hair
arranged
in
a
new
way
that
is
to
say
with
an
oily
curl
draping
over
the
forehead
and
i
had
very
carefully
penciled
some
minute
crimson
veins
upon
my
nose
i
ought
to
say
that
i
have
done
a
good
deal
of
amateur
acting
in
my
time
and
am
more
or
less
familiar
with
the
contents
of
the
box
my
master
sir
thomas
kirby
has
long
been
known
as
one
of
the
handsomest
gentlemen
in
society
he
has
a
full
face
certainly
but
entirely
suited
to
his
build
and
physical
development
of
course
when
he
shaved
off
a
mustache
that
was
a
model
of
such
adornments
it
did
alter
his
appearance
henry
preston
instead
of
the
high
collar
of
use
and
wont
i
wore
a
low
one
permanently
attached
to
what
i
believe
is
known
as
a
dicky
that
is
to
say
a
false
shirt
front
which
reaches
but
little
lower
than
the
opening
of
the
waistcoat
my
tie
was
a
of
crimson
satin
not
too
new
my
suit
of
very
serviceable
check
with
large
purchased
together
with
other
oddments
from
a
shop
in
covent
garden
i
also
wore
a
large
and
massive
gold
and
a
diamond
ring
upon
the
little
finger
of
my
right
hand
that
was
all
yet
i
swear
not
one
of
my
friends
would
have
known
me
and
what
was
more
important
still
i
was
typical
without
having
overdone
it
no
one
in
london
meeting
me
in
the
street
would
have
turned
to
look
twice
at
me
you
could
not
say
i
was
really
disguised
in
the
true
meaning
of
the
word
and
yet
i
was
certainly
entirely
transformed
and
with
my
cropped
hair
except
for
the
quiff
in
front
i
looked
as
blatant
and
genial
a
bounder
as
ever
served
a
pint
of
sixes
preston
had
left
the
room
for
a
moment
and
now
came
back
to
say
that
power
had
arrived
power
was
the
youngest
partner
in
a
celebrated
firm
of
solicitors
power
davids
and
power
a
firm
that
has
acted
for
my
father
and
myself
for
more
years
than
i
can
remember
under
his
somewhat
effeminate
exterior
and
a
languid
manner
young
power
is
one
of
the
sharpest
and
cleverest
fellows
i
know
and
what
more
one
that
can
keep
his
mouth
shut
under
any
circumstances
i
went
into
the
hoping
to
make
him
start
not
a
bit
of
it
he
merely
put
up
his
eyeglass
and
said
laconically
you
do
sir
thomas
not
more
than
two
years
ago
he
had
been
an
at
cambridge
you
think
so
power
he
nodded
and
looked
at
his
watch
all
right
then
we
be
off
i
said
and
preston
called
a
taxi
on
which
were
piled
a
large
trunk
and
a
shabby
portmanteau
also
recent
purchases
and
with
the
name
thomas
painted
boldly
upon
them
preston
christian
name
by
the
way
is
henry
and
i
had
borrowed
it
for
the
occasion
i
got
into
the
cab
with
a
curious
sensation
that
some
one
might
be
looking
on
and
discover
me
power
seated
himself
by
my
side
with
no
indication
of
thought
at
all
and
we
rolled
away
westward
nothing
remains
he
said
but
to
complete
the
documents
of
sale
everything
is
ready
and
i
have
the
money
in
notes
in
my
pocket
the
solicitor
of
the
retiring
proprietor
will
be
in
attendance
and
the
whole
thing
wo
take
more
than
twenty
minutes
newby
the
present
man
will
then
step
out
and
leave
you
in
undisturbed
possession
very
good
power
and
thank
you
for
your
negotiations
seven
thousand
pounds
seems
a
lot
of
money
for
a
little
hole
like
that
it
is
really
you
see
the
place
is
freehold
and
the
house
is
free
also
it
not
under
the
dominion
of
any
brewer
and
when
your
purpose
in
being
there
is
over
i
guarantee
to
sell
it
again
for
the
same
money
probably
a
few
hundreds
more
as
an
investment
it
sound
enough
he
relapsed
into
silence
and
we
rattled
through
hammersmith
on
our
way
to
richmond
i
was
curious
about
this
imperturbable
young
man
whom
i
knew
rather
well
are
you
curious
power
i
said
to
know
why
i
doing
this
extraordinary
unprecedented
thing
i
can
trust
you
absolutely
i
know
but
have
you
asked
yourself
what
the
deuce
i
up
to
he
favored
me
with
a
pale
smile
my
dear
sir
thomas
he
replied
if
you
only
knew
what
extraordinary
things
society
people
do
if
you
knew
a
tenth
of
what
a
solicitor
in
my
sort
of
practice
knows
you
would
think
there
was
anything
particularly
strange
in
your
little
freak
confound
the
cub
i
could
have
punched
him
in
the
jaw
i
knew
his
assurance
was
all
pose
still
it
was
admirable
in
its
way
and
i
burst
into
hearty
laughter
i
had
the
satisfaction
of
seeing
master
power
cheeks
faintly
tinged
with
pink
on
the
slope
of
the
hill
at
what
one
might
describe
as
the
back
of
the
high
wall
which
inclosed
the
grounds
at
the
foot
of
the
three
towers
that
is
to
say
it
was
exactly
opposite
the
great
central
entrance
and
i
suppose
nearly
quarter
of
a
mile
from
it
if
one
drew
a
straight
line
from
one
to
the
other
was
a
crowded
huddle
of
mean
streets
it
was
not
in
any
sense
a
slum
nothing
so
picturesque
small
drab
shabby
and
respectable
in
the
center
of
this
area
was
a
but
known
as
the
golden
swan
this
was
our
destination
and
in
a
few
minutes
more
we
had
climbed
the
hill
and
the
taxi
stood
at
rest
before
a
side
door
opening
it
we
entered
power
leading
the
way
and
as
we
approached
some
stairs
i
caught
a
glimpse
of
a
little
bar
to
the
left
where
i
could
have
sworn
i
saw
the
melancholy
sliddim
in
company
with
a
pewter
pot
we
waited
for
a
moment
or
two
in
a
long
upstairs
room
the
walls
were
covered
with
beasts
birds
and
fishes
in
glass
cases
all
of
which
looked
as
if
they
ought
to
be
decently
buried
upon
one
wall
was
an
immense
engraving
framed
in
boxwood
of
the
execution
of
mary
queen
of
scots
and
upon
a
huge
mahogany
sideboard
which
looked
as
if
it
had
been
built
to
resist
a
cavalry
charge
was
a
tray
with
hospitable
bottles
then
the
door
opened
and
a
dapper
little
man
with
side
whiskers
the
vendor
solicitor
came
in
accompanied
by
newby
the
retiring
landlord
himself
newby
dressed
i
was
glad
to
notice
very
much
as
myself
only
the
diamond
ring
upon
his
finger
was
rather
larger
was
a
short
fat
man
of
benevolent
aspect
and
i
should
say
suffering
from
dropsy
we
shook
hands
heartily
thirty
years
have
i
been
landlord
here
wheezed
newby
and
now
it
time
the
was
in
younger
your
respectability
been
vouched
for
thomas
i
would
sell
to
no
low
blackguard
for
twice
the
money
and
all
i
can
say
is
young
feller
for
you
are
a
young
feller
to
me
you
know
i
you
be
as
and
prosperous
in
the
swan
as
emanuel
newby
been
i
thought
it
was
best
to
be
a
little
awkward
and
bashful
so
i
said
very
little
while
the
lawyers
fussed
about
with
title
deeds
and
at
last
the
eventful
moment
came
when
one
does
that
conjuring
trick
in
which
the
gentlemen
of
the
law
take
such
infantile
delight
put
your
finger
here
yes
on
this
red
seal
and
say
when
it
was
all
done
and
newby
had
stowed
away
seven
thousand
pounds
in
in
a
receptacle
over
his
heart
we
drank
to
the
occasion
in
some
remarkably
good
champagne
and
then
with
a
sigh
the
announced
his
intention
of
being
off
my
luggage
has
preceded
me
he
said
and
i
have
nothing
to
do
now
but
retire
as
i
long
planned
to
the
city
of
my
birth
and
where
may
that
be
mr
newby
i
asked
politely
the
university
city
of
oxford
he
replied
which
if
you
not
known
intimate
as
i
you
can
never
begin
to
understand
there
an
atmosphere
there
thomas
but
lord
you
wo
be
interested
and
he
wheezed
superior
the
situation
was
not
without
humor
when
he
had
gone
together
with
his
solicitor
power
rang
the
bell
as
you
wish
me
to
manage
everything
for
you
he
said
i
have
done
so
your
entire
ignorance
of
the
liquor
trade
will
be
compensated
by
the
knowledge
and
devotion
of
the
assistant
i
have
procured
for
you
after
many
inquiries
his
name
is
whistlecraft
and
he
is
an
honest
fool
he
wo
rob
you
though
he
probably
diminish
your
profits
greatly
by
his
stupidity
but
as
i
understand
profit
from
the
sale
of
drinks
your
object
he
will
obey
orders
implicitly
without
even
trying
to
understand
their
reason
and
in
short
you
could
have
a
better
man
for
your
purpose
when
whistlecraft
appeared
i
perfectly
agreed
with
power
he
was
a
powerful
fellow
in
shirt
sleeves
aged
about
with
arms
that
could
have
felled
an
ox
had
he
shaved
within
the
last
three
days
he
would
have
been
clean
shaved
and
his
hair
was
polished
to
a
surface
with
suet
i
caught
him
doing
it
one
day
i
never
saw
such
calm
on
any
human
face
it
was
the
tranquillity
of
an
entire
absence
of
intellect
a
rich
and
perfect
stupidity
which
nothing
could
penetrate
nothing
disturb
his
eyes
were
dull
as
unclean
pewter
without
life
or
speculation
and
i
knew
at
once
that
if
i
told
him
to
go
down
into
the
cellar
wait
there
till
a
hyena
entered
strangle
it
skin
it
and
bring
the
pelt
upstairs
to
me
he
would
depart
upon
his
errand
without
a
word
power
went
away
with
the
most
conventional
of
handshakes
we
might
have
been
parting
in
pall
mall
and
i
was
left
alone
monarch
of
all
i
surveyed
what
the
staff
beside
you
whistlecraft
i
asked
abbs
sir
cooks
and
sweeps
up
sleeps
out
peter
the
boy
washes
bottles
and
such
and
that
all
then
at
closing
time
you
and
i
are
left
alone
in
the
house
yes
sir
there
was
a
loud
and
impatient
knocking
from
somewhere
below
i
better
go
and
serve
sir
had
i
said
whistlecraft
i
found
later
his
name
was
stanley
and
i
let
him
go
at
that
i
spent
the
next
hour
going
over
the
premises
from
cellar
to
roof
and
making
many
mental
notes
for
i
had
come
here
with
a
definite
purpose
and
plans
already
made
it
was
an
extraordinary
situation
to
be
in
i
sat
in
a
little
private
room
behind
the
bar
and
every
now
and
again
stanley
idiot
countenance
appeared
and
i
had
to
go
behind
the
counter
and
be
introduced
to
this
or
that
regular
frequenter
i
asked
every
one
to
have
a
drink
for
the
good
of
the
house
and
trust
i
made
a
fair
impression
they
all
seemed
quiet
respectable
people
enough
who
knew
each
other
well
in
the
evening
i
was
greatly
helped
by
sliddim
who
was
now
a
seasoned
habitué
of
the
golden
swan
and
whom
from
the
moment
of
my
arrival
slipped
into
the
position
of
master
of
the
ceremonies
which
saved
me
a
great
deal
of
trouble
it
will
be
remembered
that
all
the
time
that
i
was
in
brittany
sliddim
had
been
employed
in
my
interests
at
richmond
bill
rolston
vouched
absolutely
for
the
man
fidelity
had
told
me
i
could
safely
trust
him
in
any
way
accordingly
there
was
perhaps
a
little
misgiving
i
had
released
him
from
his
employment
at
the
detective
agency
where
he
worked
and
took
him
permanently
into
my
service
i
may
say
at
once
though
he
took
no
prominent
part
in
the
great
events
which
followed
until
the
very
end
he
was
of
considerable
use
to
me
and
kept
my
secrets
perfectly
at
closing
time
that
night
abbs
the
cook
having
spread
a
hot
supper
in
the
private
room
behind
the
bar
and
left
i
called
the
potman
in
from
his
of
glass
and
bade
him
share
the
meal
now
i
tell
you
what
stanley
i
said
when
we
had
filled
our
pipes
in
the
tower
inclosure
there
a
whole
colony
of
chinks
is
there
yes
sir
gardeners
stokers
for
the
engines
and
such
like
they
say
as
there
is
a
white
man
among
except
only
the
boss
and
he
an
irishman
they
do
always
live
inside
that
wall
i
jerked
my
head
towards
a
window
which
looked
out
into
my
back
yard
not
a
hundred
feet
away
from
the
towering
precipice
of
brick
which
overshadowed
the
golden
swan
and
the
surrounding
houses
oh
not
by
no
means
they
comes
out
when
their
work
done
in
the
evenings
though
they
goes
back
to
sleep
and
has
to
be
in
by
a
certain
time
they
do
say
and
here
something
happened
to
stanley
face
which
i
afterwards
grew
to
recognize
as
a
smile
they
do
say
as
some
of
the
girls
downtown
are
takin
up
with
seein
as
they
dress
well
and
spend
a
lot
of
money
i
suppose
they
have
somewhere
where
they
go
it
mostly
the
sun
down
by
the
station
i
am
told
the
boss
there
was
a
sailor
and
understands
their
ways
he
given
them
a
room
to
themselves
i
was
perfectly
aware
of
all
this
but
i
had
a
special
motive
for
the
present
conversation
now
it
come
into
my
mind
i
said
that
there
a
lot
of
custom
going
downtown
that
ought
by
rights
to
come
to
the
swan
seeing
that
we
are
close
at
the
gates
so
to
speak
and
i
mean
to
do
what
i
can
to
get
hold
of
it
a
chink
money
is
as
good
as
anybody
else
stanley
that
my
way
of
looking
at
it
he
chewed
the
cud
of
that
idea
for
a
minute
or
two
and
then
it
dawned
in
the
pudding
of
his
mind
why
yes
he
said
in
the
voice
of
one
who
had
made
a
great
discovery
now
there
that
room
upstairs
i
went
on
i
shall
never
use
it
if
we
could
get
some
of
these
chinks
to
drop
in
there
of
a
night
it
would
be
good
business
there
just
one
thing
against
it
said
stanley
if
you
pardon
my
speaking
of
it
sir
i
willing
to
do
everything
in
reason
and
i
not
afraid
of
work
but
i
do
see
as
i
can
attend
to
both
the
saloon
and
the
bars
if
i
to
be
going
upstairs
slinging
drinks
to
the
chinks
of
course
you
ca
and
i
was
going
to
suggest
it
we
must
get
an
extra
help
if
we
can
get
the
chinks
to
use
the
house
we
might
have
a
barmaid
he
shook
his
head
it
would
work
sir
you
have
to
get
a
new
one
every
week
a
young
woman
ca
resist
a
chink
and
they
marry
off
like
stanley
was
unable
to
think
of
a
simile
so
he
buried
his
face
in
his
pewter
pot
really
things
were
going
very
well
for
me
i
believe
you
are
right
supposing
i
could
get
a
young
fellow
who
was
one
of
themselves
and
could
speak
their
lingo
there
are
lots
to
be
picked
up
about
the
docks
i
mean
some
quiet
young
chink
who
would
attend
to
his
in
the
evening
and
relieve
you
of
a
lot
of
the
and
things
of
that
sort
during
the
day
stanley
whistlecraft
was
not
so
stupid
as
to
miss
the
advantages
of
such
a
proposal
as
this
you
on
the
very
plan
sir
he
said
and
especial
if
he
could
wash
up
them
thin
glasses
which
the
gentlemen
in
the
saloon
bar
like
to
it
would
be
a
great
saving
i
never
could
them
things
properly
you
put
your
fingers
on
and
they
crack
worse
than
eggs
pewters
i
can
polish
with
any
man
alive
pot
mugs
seldom
break
as
likewise
them
thick
reputed
which
will
break
a
man
open
as
i
proved
but
these
chinks
are
as
as
any
girl
and
i
think
sir
you
got
of
an
idea
i
see
about
it
in
the
morning
i
got
a
pal
that
has
a
nice
little
house
in
the
mile
end
road
and
i
believe
he
could
send
me
just
the
lad
i
want
well
now
you
can
go
to
bed
stanley
everything
locked
up
yes
sir
then
i
put
out
the
lights
he
bade
me
a
gruff
and
lurched
heavily
away
i
heard
him
ascending
the
stairs
to
his
room
at
the
back
of
the
house
and
then
i
was
left
alone
the
first
thing
i
did
was
to
turn
down
the
sleeves
of
my
shirt
and
put
on
my
coat
it
is
etiquette
to
sup
in
your
coat
i
had
gathered
from
whistlecraft
custom
when
he
accepted
my
invitation
then
i
unlocked
a
drawer
in
which
was
a
box
of
cigars
such
as
the
golden
swan
had
never
known
and
stretching
out
my
legs
stared
into
the
fire
i
was
doing
the
wildest
maddest
thing
but
so
far
all
had
gone
well
i
was
as
it
were
a
solitary
swimmer
in
deep
and
dangerous
waters
on
the
threshold
of
experiences
which
i
knew
instinctively
would
transcend
all
those
of
ordinary
life
i
was
perfectly
certain
something
in
my
inmost
soul
told
me
that
i
was
about
to
step
into
unknown
perils
and
to
contend
with
bizarre
and
sinister
forces
of
which
i
had
no
means
of
measuring
the
power
or
extent
i
do
mind
admitting
that
on
that
first
night
in
the
golden
swan
fate
weighed
heavily
on
me
and
i
thought
i
heard
the
muffled
laughter
of
malignant
things
however
i
was
in
for
it
now
i
finished
my
cigar
went
into
the
bar
and
selected
a
certain
bottle
of
whisky
the
excellent
stanley
had
warned
me
that
this
was
the
landlord
bottle
and
of
a
much
more
reputable
quality
than
that
served
to
the
landlord
guests
after
a
very
moderate
nightcap
i
put
on
carpet
slippers
and
went
up
to
my
room
which
i
had
chosen
at
the
very
top
of
the
house
it
was
a
large
attic
just
under
the
roof
and
in
a
few
days
i
proposed
to
make
it
more
habitable
with
some
new
furniture
and
decoration
meanwhile
i
had
chosen
it
because
in
one
corner
some
wooden
steps
went
up
to
a
which
opened
on
to
the
roof
where
there
was
a
flat
space
of
some
three
yards
square
among
the
chimneys
just
before
going
up
to
bed
i
turned
up
the
collar
of
my
ascended
the
ladder
pushed
open
the
and
stepped
out
on
to
the
leads
it
was
a
still
moonlight
night
looking
over
the
roofs
of
the
houses
i
could
see
the
thames
winding
like
a
silver
ribbon
far
down
below
a
scene
of
utter
tranquillity
and
peace
then
i
wheeled
round
to
be
confronted
with
the
great
black
wall
which
rose
several
yards
above
me
within
a
pistol
shot
of
distance
but
my
eye
traveled
up
beyond
that
and
was
caught
in
a
colossal
network
of
steel
so
bold
towering
and
gigantic
in
its
nearness
that
it
almost
made
me
reel
i
stared
up
among
the
dark
shadows
and
moonlit
spaces
till
my
eye
reached
an
altitude
which
i
knew
to
be
about
the
height
of
the
golden
ball
on
the
top
of
saint
paul
cathedral
there
the
vision
checked
i
could
see
a
blur
of
low
buildings
a
web
of
latticed
galleries
and
i
knew
that
i
was
looking
only
up
at
the
very
of
the
city
in
the
clouds
which
must
be
lying
bare
to
the
moon
some
sixteen
hundred
feet
above
i
could
see
no
more
the
first
stage
barred
all
further
vision
though
that
in
itself
seemed
terrible
in
its
height
and
majesty
so
i
closed
my
eyes
and
imagined
only
those
supreme
heights
where
she
must
be
sleeping
juanita
i
murmured
and
then
as
i
descended
into
my
room
the
words
of
the
psalmist
came
to
me
and
i
said
oh
that
i
had
the
wings
of
a
dove
chapter
eight
on
the
afternoon
of
the
next
day
the
potman
summoned
me
from
my
private
room
with
the
information
that
there
was
a
young
fellow
from
the
mile
end
road
to
see
me
chinese
i
asked
yes
sir
then
it
must
be
the
lad
come
in
answer
to
the
telegram
i
sent
to
my
friend
this
morning
show
him
in
in
a
few
moments
the
applicant
for
the
situation
entered
he
wore
his
oily
black
hair
fairly
short
like
most
of
the
chinamen
employed
at
the
towers
and
had
no
pigtail
he
was
dressed
in
european
clothes
his
high
cheek
bones
with
little
slits
of
eyes
above
them
the
stolid
yellow
face
and
fine
tapering
fingers
were
typically
oriental
as
he
glided
in
and
his
european
clothes
seemed
to
accentuate
that
air
of
eastern
mystery
that
even
the
commonest
chinaman
carries
about
with
him
he
looked
about
five
or
six
and
twenty
and
wore
a
thick
gold
ring
in
each
ear
which
had
had
the
effect
of
dragging
them
away
from
the
head
i
examined
him
carefully
as
to
his
qualities
and
he
answered
in
better
english
than
most
chinamen
attain
to
though
with
the
guttural
clicking
accent
of
his
kind
take
him
and
let
him
wash
up
a
few
of
the
glasses
stanley
and
ask
him
a
few
questions
if
you
like
and
if
you
are
satisfied
with
him
engage
him
in
a
quarter
of
an
hour
the
honest
fool
returned
to
express
himself
pleased
with
the
young
asiatic
performances
and
there
and
then
i
engaged
him
stanley
showing
him
the
room
in
which
he
was
to
sleep
it
was
quite
late
that
night
before
i
could
be
alone
with
the
new
assistant
who
by
the
way
served
in
the
saloon
bar
during
the
evening
and
was
spoken
of
with
commendation
by
carter
fish
and
green
grocer
mogridge
our
principal
newsagent
and
tobacconist
and
abrahams
dealer
in
anything
whose
shop
was
labeled
really
with
great
propriety
antiques
these
gentlemen
were
my
most
constant
patrons
and
their
word
had
weight
and
it
was
endorsed
by
sliddim
who
slipped
in
about
nine
and
in
the
position
of
a
friend
of
the
landlord
had
been
received
into
our
best
circle
it
was
mogridge
a
wit
who
just
before
closing
time
christened
ah
sing
the
name
of
the
new
potman
the
name
which
he
retained
to
the
end
of
the
chapter
i
could
hear
my
clients
laughing
for
the
twentieth
time
as
they
went
home
and
carter
rich
bass
mogridge
i
call
that
good
that
damned
good
mogridge
ha
ha
ha
ha
ah
sing
glided
into
my
private
room
just
as
the
upper
portion
of
the
house
began
to
tremble
with
the
snores
of
the
honest
fool
he
put
his
fingers
into
his
mouth
and
withdrew
two
pads
of
composition
such
as
dentists
use
with
a
sigh
of
relief
immediately
the
high
cheek
bones
and
the
narrowness
of
the
eyes
disappeared
though
even
then
bill
rolston
would
have
passed
for
a
chinaman
at
a
glance
though
when
he
removed
the
quills
from
his
nose
and
it
ceased
to
be
flat
and
distended
the
likeness
was
less
apparent
it
wonderful
rolston
i
said
shaking
him
warmly
by
the
hand
it
would
deceive
any
one
well
here
we
are
and
now
we
can
begin
the
lad
was
all
fire
and
enthusiasm
he
did
me
no
end
of
good
for
the
sordid
environment
the
appalling
meals
principally
of
pork
served
in
great
gobbets
with
quantities
of
onions
which
abbs
provided
for
the
herself
and
me
and
above
all
the
overpowering
incredible
structure
at
hand
which
seemed
in
its
strength
and
majesty
to
laugh
at
the
activities
of
such
an
one
as
i
were
beginning
to
depress
and
to
tinge
my
hours
with
the
quality
of
a
fantastic
dream
but
rolston
changed
all
that
and
we
talked
far
on
into
the
night
planning
plotting
and
arranging
all
the
details
of
our
campaign
he
said
i
paint
the
board
to
go
over
the
side
door
in
black
and
gilt
chinese
lettering
as
soon
as
it
done
we
will
make
one
or
two
alterations
to
the
upstairs
room
buy
a
gas
urn
with
constant
hot
water
and
some
special
tea
which
i
know
where
to
get
when
that
done
i
start
the
game
by
going
down
to
the
sun
and
meeting
the
chinese
there
you
are
quite
certain
that
you
wo
be
discovered
i
think
it
in
the
last
degree
improbable
certainly
no
one
could
find
me
out
owing
to
my
speech
that
i
can
assure
you
sir
thomas
and
nearly
all
the
battle
so
very
very
few
europeans
ever
attain
to
good
colloquial
chinese
that
there
would
never
be
a
doubt
in
any
one
but
i
was
what
i
seemed
to
be
i
not
only
know
the
language
but
i
know
how
these
people
think
and
most
of
their
customs
as
far
as
disguise
goes
i
think
it
good
enough
to
deceive
any
one
when
i
was
a
prisoner
within
the
inclosure
the
chinese
who
saw
me
were
for
the
most
part
coolies
and
laborers
engaged
upon
the
works
all
these
have
now
gone
away
forever
and
there
only
the
regular
selected
staff
some
of
these
of
course
must
have
seen
me
as
i
was
but
i
do
think
they
will
penetrate
my
you
see
the
whole
shape
of
the
face
is
altered
to
begin
with
and
the
coloring
of
hair
and
face
has
been
done
so
well
as
to
defy
detection
i
certainly
was
afraid
about
my
ears
and
he
grinned
ruefully
but
i
saw
the
way
out
by
having
them
pierced
and
these
rings
put
in
most
of
the
natives
from
the
province
of
where
i
come
from
wear
these
rings
the
ones
i
have
on
at
the
present
moment
are
made
of
lead
and
gilded
they
have
pulled
my
ears
right
out
of
their
ordinary
shape
good
lord
i
cried
astounded
at
the
length
to
which
he
had
gone
you
torturing
yourself
for
me
not
a
bit
of
it
sir
thomas
he
replied
i
i
rather
like
it
and
you
think
you
will
be
able
to
get
us
a
chinese
clientèle
i
am
quite
certain
of
it
first
of
all
i
do
suppose
i
shall
get
the
best
class
i
mean
the
upper
and
more
confidential
servants
who
ascend
the
tower
itself
for
i
understand
there
a
very
rigid
system
of
grades
but
little
by
little
they
will
come
also
it
will
take
us
weeks
maybe
months
but
it
will
be
done
if
it
takes
me
half
a
lifetime
i
go
through
with
it
i
said
savagely
my
sentiments
also
he
replied
lighting
a
cigarette
by
the
way
i
hope
you
not
incommoded
in
any
way
by
my
er
odor
good
heaven
what
do
you
mean
the
chinaman
smells
quite
different
to
the
european
though
not
necessarily
unpleasantly
it
taken
me
quite
a
lot
of
trouble
to
attain
the
essential
perfume
he
grinned
impishly
as
he
said
it
and
there
certainly
was
a
sort
of
stale
camphory
smell
now
he
mentioned
it
you
a
great
artist
rolston
and
i
do
know
what
i
should
do
without
you
oh
mandarin
from
that
another
point
he
said
quickly
you
would
guess
why
supposed
to
come
from
where
i
actually
did
spend
some
years
of
my
childhood
not
in
the
least
it
the
principal
opium
producing
province
in
china
he
replied
with
a
quick
look
at
me
now
sir
thomas
i
let
the
cat
out
of
the
bag
you
see
how
i
propose
to
attract
the
chinese
here
and
get
into
their
confidence
a
light
flashed
in
upon
me
and
i
took
a
long
breath
but
it
would
never
do
i
said
if
we
were
to
start
an
opium
den
in
that
room
upstairs
we
should
have
the
police
in
in
a
fortnight
and
then
the
game
would
be
up
entirely
he
smiled
superior
there
will
never
be
a
single
pipe
of
opium
smoked
in
the
swan
he
said
of
that
i
can
assure
you
that
will
be
the
very
strictest
rule
that
i
shall
make
but
i
shall
supply
opium
to
the
customers
in
varying
quantities
and
at
intervals
according
to
the
need
of
each
individual
case
it
is
almost
impossible
to
bribe
a
chinaman
with
money
the
better
sort
that
is
the
picked
and
chosen
men
who
will
be
around
morse
himself
but
opium
is
quite
another
thing
and
besides
they
wo
know
they
being
bribed
i
sat
hours
and
hours
working
this
thing
out
and
i
confident
it
the
only
way
when
he
said
that
i
realized
that
he
spoke
the
truth
but
i
confess
that
the
idea
startled
and
alarmed
me
we
shall
be
breaking
the
law
rolston
we
shall
be
risking
heavy
fines
and
certain
imprisonment
if
we
found
out
to
that
i
would
say
two
things
sir
thomas
first
of
all
that
no
fine
matters
and
secondly
that
i
should
in
the
least
mind
doing
six
months
if
necessary
this
great
game
is
worth
more
than
that
but
secondly
and
you
may
really
put
your
mind
at
ease
we
shall
be
found
out
i
have
worked
the
thing
out
to
a
hair
breadth
and
my
system
is
so
complete
that
discovery
is
utterly
impossible
i
ought
to
let
you
risk
it
though
of
course
i
shall
share
equally
if
anything
happens
he
disregarded
this
entirely
but
the
stuff
i
said
the
opium
itself
how
will
you
get
that
i
have
made
my
plans
here
also
i
shall
have
to
pay
a
price
so
enormous
that
i
afraid
it
will
stagger
you
sir
thomas
but
it
the
only
way
in
which
i
can
get
hold
of
the
right
stuff
for
what
it
is
intrinsically
worth
about
sixty
pounds
sterling
your
dealer
will
pay
pounds
and
make
a
big
profit
on
it
i
shall
have
to
pay
nearly
a
thousand
and
i
shall
want
double
that
money
two
thousand
pounds
he
stared
at
me
in
anxiety
my
dear
rolston
i
said
cheer
up
my
income
is
over
twenty
thousand
a
year
and
in
normal
times
i
do
spend
a
third
of
it
buy
all
the
filth
you
want
and
heaven
send
that
it
does
the
trick
in
two
days
he
said
the
swan
will
house
two
cases
of
the
best
bricks
obtainable
on
the
market
anywhere
for
it
as
much
by
the
superior
quality
of
what
i
shall
supply
as
well
as
the
fact
of
being
able
to
supply
it
that
i
depend
of
course
you
get
nearly
all
the
money
back
confound
it
no
that
going
too
far
we
send
all
the
abominable
profits
to
the
richmond
hospital
anonymously
we
talked
until
the
fire
was
out
and
the
gray
wintry
dawn
began
to
steal
in
through
the
dirty
windows
of
the
bar
beyond
and
when
all
our
plans
were
laid
with
meticulous
care
i
went
to
bed
but
not
to
sleep
assailed
by
a
thousand
doubts
and
fears
in
a
week
or
two
the
upstairs
room
began
to
be
frequented
by
yellow
men
who
came
and
went
unobtrusively
whenever
any
of
them
chanced
to
meet
me
i
was
greeted
with
a
profound
obeisance
which
was
rather
disconcerting
at
first
but
my
conversation
was
limited
to
a
mere
greeting
or
farewell
most
of
these
men
spoke
pigeon
english
but
i
had
little
or
nothing
to
say
to
them
of
set
purpose
it
had
been
arranged
between
rolston
and
myself
that
i
was
to
be
represented
as
a
fool
who
mattered
very
little
in
any
way
for
his
part
the
pretended
ah
sing
was
up
and
down
the
stairs
a
dozen
times
every
evening
he
was
never
once
suspected
his
influence
and
importance
in
the
lives
of
these
aliens
grew
every
day
but
it
was
a
long
business
a
long
and
weary
business
in
which
at
first
hardly
any
progress
towards
our
aim
could
be
discerned
it
no
use
being
discouraged
sir
thomas
rolston
would
say
getting
on
famously
and
the
opium
somehow
i
was
very
keen
on
discussing
that
aspect
of
the
question
i
employing
it
most
judiciously
selling
it
in
very
small
quantities
and
of
course
not
a
grain
is
ever
smoked
or
consumed
in
any
way
upon
these
premises
that
thoroughly
understood
by
every
one
and
you
need
not
have
the
slightest
doubt
but
that
the
secret
will
be
rigidly
kept
at
present
the
men
frequenting
the
house
are
nearly
all
of
the
upper
coolie
class
that
is
to
say
they
are
the
gardeners
stokers
of
the
power
house
sweepers
and
so
forth
but
quite
recently
a
better
class
of
man
has
made
his
appearance
there
a
young
electrician
who
has
been
once
or
twice
moreover
i
have
gained
a
great
point
i
have
become
acquainted
with
the
keeper
of
the
inclosure
gate
that
certainly
something
i
replied
recalling
the
figure
of
the
gigantic
chinaman
in
question
which
was
familiar
to
most
of
the
residents
beneath
the
wall
he
a
brute
at
one
time
he
was
headsman
of
yangtsun
and
they
say
a
most
finished
expert
with
the
sword
rolston
remarked
with
a
grin
all
i
know
about
him
is
that
he
sell
his
soul
for
the
black
smoke
and
regards
me
as
a
most
valuable
addition
to
the
neighborhood
in
a
fortnight
or
so
i
am
pretty
certain
i
shall
be
able
to
pass
in
and
out
of
the
grounds
pretty
much
as
i
like
and
then
a
great
move
in
our
game
will
have
been
accomplished
as
an
undoubted
chinaman
and
as
a
confidential
purveyer
of
opium
i
shall
soon
have
complete
freedom
below
the
towers
but
what
about
the
great
prizefighter
mulligan
he
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
park
as
they
call
all
the
grounds
around
the
towers
now
that
the
building
is
finished
his
functions
are
up
in
the
air
and
i
gather
that
he
lives
on
the
third
stage
just
beneath
the
city
itself
as
a
sort
of
the
asiatics
are
entirely
managed
by
their
own
leaders
appointed
by
morse
himself
it
was
as
bill
predicted
in
a
very
short
space
of
time
he
was
away
from
the
golden
swan
as
much
as
he
was
in
it
and
every
day
he
gathered
more
and
more
information
about
the
tower
and
its
mistress
information
which
was
carefully
noted
down
in
the
silence
of
the
night
so
that
no
detail
should
be
forgotten
of
course
the
fact
that
my
hotel
had
become
a
haunt
of
the
yellow
men
neither
escaped
the
notice
of
the
neighbors
nor
of
the
police
the
former
were
easily
dealt
with
and
especially
my
patrons
mogridge
having
invented
was
disposed
to
look
upon
the
chinks
with
genial
patronage
and
his
was
gratified
by
the
low
bows
with
which
they
always
greeted
him
as
they
passed
to
their
above
the
lead
of
mogridge
was
followed
by
others
in
the
saloon
bar
and
sliddim
tactfully
kept
everything
running
smoothly
as
for
the
police
they
paid
me
one
visit
or
two
were
shown
everything
and
were
perfectly
satisfied
that
the
house
was
being
conducted
with
propriety
as
indeed
it
was
the
yellow
men
neither
gambled
nor
got
drunk
that
was
perfectly
obvious
there
was
never
a
suspicion
of
opium
from
first
to
last
nor
was
there
a
single
instance
of
a
brawl
or
a
fight
indeed
the
local
an
excellent
fellow
with
whom
i
had
many
a
talk
expressed
himself
as
being
both
surprised
and
delighted
at
the
way
in
which
i
had
the
aliens
in
hand
nearly
two
months
had
gone
by
and
i
was
curbing
the
raging
fires
of
impatience
and
longing
as
well
as
i
could
when
two
incidents
occurred
which
greatly
precipitated
action
rolston
came
to
me
one
day
in
a
state
of
great
excitement
at
last
he
said
he
was
beginning
to
become
acquainted
with
some
of
the
actual
officials
of
the
towers
at
last
quite
separate
from
those
who
worked
below
they
were
interested
or
beginning
to
be
so
and
he
urged
me
at
once
to
open
a
smaller
inner
room
as
a
select
for
such
of
them
as
he
could
inveigle
to
the
golden
swan
we
did
so
at
once
hanging
the
walls
with
a
drapery
of
black
worked
with
golden
dragons
which
i
bought
in
regent
street
a
chinese
lantern
of
copper
hanging
from
the
ceiling
and
around
the
wall
we
placed
low
couches
here
in
twos
and
threes
but
in
slowly
increasing
numbers
a
different
type
of
oriental
began
to
assemble
ah
sing
attending
to
all
their
wants
ingratiating
himself
in
every
possible
way
and
keeping
his
extremely
useful
ears
wide
open
very
wide
open
indeed
it
was
now
that
tiny
fragments
of
personal
gossip
more
precious
to
me
than
rubies
began
to
filter
through
i
had
established
no
communication
with
the
city
in
the
clouds
as
yet
but
i
seemed
to
hear
the
distant
murmur
of
voices
through
the
void
one
evening
about
eight
i
felt
cramped
and
unutterably
bored
i
felt
that
nothing
could
help
me
but
a
long
walk
and
so
with
a
word
to
the
honest
fool
sliddim
and
rolston
i
took
my
hat
and
stick
and
started
out
it
was
a
brilliant
moonlight
night
calm
still
and
with
a
white
frost
upon
the
ground
as
i
descended
the
terrace
and
made
my
way
down
to
the
side
of
the
river
here
and
there
i
passed
a
few
courting
couples
the
hum
of
distant
london
and
the
rumbling
of
trains
was
like
the
ground
swell
of
a
sea
but
peace
brooded
over
everything
the
trees
made
black
shadows
like
chinese
ink
upon
silver
and
in
the
full
moonlight
it
was
bright
enough
to
read
when
i
had
walked
a
mile
or
so
resisting
a
certain
temptation
as
well
as
i
could
i
stopped
and
turned
at
last
there
a
mile
away
behind
me
yet
seeming
as
if
it
was
within
a
throw
was
the
huge
erection
on
the
hill
every
detail
of
the
lower
parts
was
clear
and
distinct
as
an
architectural
drawing
the
intricate
of
enormous
cantilevers
and
girders
seemed
etched
on
the
inside
of
a
great
opal
bowl
i
can
give
you
no
adequate
description
of
the
immensity
the
almost
sense
of
magnitude
and
majesty
i
have
stood
beside
the
pyramids
at
night
i
have
crossed
the
piazza
of
saint
peter
at
rome
under
the
rays
of
the
italian
moon
and
i
have
drunk
coffee
at
the
base
of
the
eiffel
tower
in
paris
but
not
one
of
these
experiences
approached
what
i
felt
now
as
i
surveyed
in
an
ecstasy
of
mingled
emotions
this
monstrous
thing
that
brooded
over
london
the
eye
traveled
up
onward
and
forever
up
until
at
length
not
hidden
by
clouds
now
but
a
faint
blur
of
white
blue
gold
and
tiny
twinkling
lights
hung
in
the
empyrean
the
city
of
desire
could
she
hear
the
call
of
my
heart
god
knows
it
seemed
loud
and
strong
enough
to
me
might
she
not
be
even
at
this
moment
a
lovelier
juliet
leaning
over
some
gilded
gallery
and
wondering
where
i
was
was
ever
a
woman
so
high
above
her
lover
before
i
said
and
laughed
but
my
laughter
was
sadness
and
my
longing
pain
unbearable
there
was
a
slight
bend
in
the
where
i
stood
caused
by
some
trees
and
from
just
below
i
suddenly
heard
a
burst
of
loud
and
brutal
laughter
followed
by
a
shrill
cry
it
recalled
me
from
dreamland
at
once
and
i
hurried
round
the
projection
to
come
upon
a
strange
scene
two
flash
young
bullies
with
spotted
handkerchiefs
around
their
throats
and
ash
sticks
in
their
hands
were
menacing
a
third
person
whose
back
was
to
the
river
they
were
sawing
the
air
with
their
sticks
just
in
front
of
a
thin
tall
figure
dressed
in
what
seemed
to
be
a
sort
of
long
buttoned
black
cassock
descending
to
the
feet
and
wearing
a
skull
cap
of
black
alpaca
beneath
the
skull
cap
was
a
thin
ascetic
face
ghastly
yellow
in
the
moonlight
one
of
the
brutes
lunged
at
the
man
i
now
saw
to
be
a
chinese
of
some
consequence
lunged
at
him
with
a
brutal
laugh
and
filthy
oath
the
chinaman
threw
up
his
lean
arms
cried
out
again
in
a
thin
shrill
scream
stepped
backwards
missed
his
footing
and
went
souse
into
the
river
in
a
second
the
current
caught
him
and
began
to
whirl
him
away
over
towards
the
twickenham
side
it
was
obvious
that
he
could
not
swim
a
stroke
there
was
a
clatter
of
boots
and
bully
number
one
was
legging
it
down
the
path
like
a
hare
i
had
just
time
to
give
bully
number
two
a
straight
left
on
the
nap
which
sent
him
down
like
a
sack
of
flour
before
i
got
my
coat
off
and
dived
in
wow
but
it
was
icy
cold
for
a
moment
the
shock
seemed
to
stop
my
heart
and
then
it
came
right
again
and
i
struck
out
heartily
it
take
long
to
catch
up
with
the
gentleman
in
the
cassock
who
had
come
up
for
the
second
time
and
apparently
resigned
himself
to
the
worst
i
got
hold
of
him
turned
on
my
back
and
prepared
for
stern
measures
if
he
should
attempt
to
grip
me
he
did
he
was
the
easiest
johnny
to
rescue
possible
and
in
another
five
minutes
i
got
him
safely
to
the
bank
and
scrambled
up
there
was
nobody
about
worse
luck
and
i
started
to
pump
the
water
out
of
him
as
well
as
i
could
and
after
a
few
minutes
had
the
satisfaction
of
seeing
his
face
turn
from
to
something
like
its
normal
yellow
under
the
somewhat
ghastly
light
of
the
moon
his
teeth
began
to
chatter
as
i
jerked
him
to
his
feet
and
furiously
rubbed
him
up
and
down
i
tried
to
recall
what
i
knew
of
pigeon
english
bad
man
throw
you
in
river
you
velly
lucky
man
come
by
save
you
johnny
i
had
the
shock
of
my
life
i
am
indeed
fortunate
came
in
a
thin
voice
i
am
indeed
fortunate
in
having
found
so
brave
a
preserver
honorable
sir
from
this
moment
my
life
is
yours
why
you
speak
perfect
english
i
said
in
amazement
i
have
been
resident
in
this
country
for
some
time
sir
he
replied
as
a
student
at
king
college
until
i
undertook
my
present
work
well
i
said
we
better
not
stand
here
exchanging
polite
remarks
much
longer
there
is
such
a
thing
as
pneumonia
which
you
would
do
well
to
avoid
if
you
strong
enough
we
hurry
up
to
the
terrace
and
find
my
house
where
we
get
you
dry
and
warm
i
the
landlord
of
the
swan
hotel
he
was
a
polite
fellow
this
he
bowed
profoundly
and
then
as
the
water
dripped
from
his
black
and
meager
form
he
said
something
rather
extraordinary
i
should
never
have
thought
it
i
cursed
myself
the
excitement
had
made
me
return
to
the
manner
of
piccadilly
and
this
shrewd
observer
had
seen
it
in
a
moment
i
said
no
more
but
took
him
by
the
arm
and
yanked
him
along
for
one
of
the
fastest
miles
he
had
ever
done
in
his
life
i
took
him
to
the
side
door
of
my
pub
fortunately
ah
sing
was
descending
the
stairs
to
replenish
an
empty
decanter
with
whisky
my
yellow
gentlemen
used
to
like
it
in
their
tea
i
explained
what
had
happened
in
a
few
words
and
my
shivering
derelict
was
hurried
upstairs
to
my
own
bedroom
i
do
know
what
rolston
did
to
him
though
i
heard
sliddim
now
quite
the
house
cat
directed
to
run
down
into
the
kitchen
and
confer
with
abbs
for
my
part
i
sat
in
the
room
behind
the
bar
listening
to
the
honest
fool
talking
with
my
patrons
and
shed
my
clothes
before
a
blazing
fire
a
little
hot
rum
a
change
and
a
and
i
was
myself
again
and
smoking
a
pipe
i
fell
into
a
sort
of
dream
it
was
a
pleasant
dream
i
suppose
the
shock
of
the
swim
the
race
up
the
terrace
to
the
swan
the
rum
and
milk
which
followed
had
a
soporific
soothing
effect
i
was
exactly
asleep
i
was
pleasantly
drowsed
and
i
had
a
sort
of
feeling
that
something
was
going
to
happen
just
about
closing
time
rolston
glided
in
i
never
saw
a
european
before
or
since
who
could
so
perfectly
imitate
the
ghost
walk
of
the
yellow
men
i
looked
to
see
that
the
door
to
the
bar
was
shut
well
how
our
friend
i
asked
he
had
a
big
shock
sir
thomas
but
he
all
right
now
i
rubbed
him
all
over
with
oil
fed
him
up
with
and
brandy
and
found
him
dry
clothes
he
from
the
towers
of
course
as
i
said
this
i
saw
bill
rolston
face
beneath
its
yellow
dye
was
blazing
with
excitement
sir
thomas
he
said
in
a
whisper
this
is
himself
chinese
secretary
a
man
utterly
different
from
the
others
we
have
seen
here
yet
he
of
the
mandarin
class
the
buttons
on
his
robe
are
of
red
coral
in
this
house
at
this
moment
we
have
one
of
the
masters
of
the
secret
city
i
gave
a
long
low
whistle
which
i
remember
it
so
well
exactly
coincided
with
the
raucous
shout
of
the
honest
fool
time
gentlemen
please
a
thought
struck
me
the
other
chinese
in
the
large
and
small
rooms
do
they
know
this
man
is
here
no
sir
thomas
i
am
more
than
glad
to
say
i
got
him
up
to
your
own
room
when
both
doors
were
closed
what
he
doing
now
he
having
a
little
sleep
i
promised
to
call
him
in
an
hour
or
so
when
he
wishes
to
pay
you
his
respects
he
listened
for
a
moment
the
others
are
going
downstairs
he
said
i
must
be
there
to
see
them
out
and
i
have
one
or
two
little
transactions
he
felt
in
a
villainous
side
pocket
and
i
knew
as
well
as
possible
what
it
contained
and
what
would
be
handed
to
one
or
two
of
the
gentlemen
as
they
slipped
out
of
the
side
door
on
their
way
home
bill
came
back
in
some
twenty
minutes
now
he
said
i
going
upstairs
to
wake
and
bring
him
down
to
you
you
must
remember
sir
thomas
that
i
am
only
a
dirty
little
servant
i
am
as
far
beneath
a
man
like
as
sir
thomas
kirby
is
above
stanley
whistlecraft
so
i
can
not
be
present
at
your
interview
my
idea
was
that
i
should
creep
into
the
bar
stanley
will
have
had
his
supper
and
gone
to
bed
and
lie
down
on
the
floor
with
my
ear
to
the
bottom
of
the
door
then
i
can
hear
everything
that
a
good
idea
i
said
for
i
was
beginning
to
realize
what
an
enormous
lot
might
depend
upon
this
interview
then
i
thought
of
something
else
look
here
bill
you
must
remember
this
too
i
fished
the
blighter
out
of
the
thames
and
no
doubt
he
will
be
thankful
in
his
overdone
oriental
fashion
but
to
him
a
man
of
the
class
you
say
he
is
i
shall
be
nothing
but
a
vulgar
publican
and
i
do
see
quite
what
going
to
come
out
of
he
had
slipped
the
pads
out
of
his
cheeks
an
operation
to
which
i
had
grown
quite
accustomed
and
i
could
see
his
face
as
it
really
was
that
occurred
to
me
also
he
replied
but
somehow
or
other
i
sure
the
fates
are
on
our
side
he
arose
turned
away
for
a
moment
there
was
a
click
and
a
gasp
and
he
was
the
little
impassive
oriental
again
he
glided
up
to
me
put
his
yellow
hand
with
the
long
polished
finger
nails
upon
my
shoulder
and
said
in
my
ear
sir
thomas
he
must
see
her
every
day
he
vanished
from
the
room
almost
as
he
spoke
and
left
me
with
blood
on
fire
i
was
to
see
some
one
who
might
have
spoken
with
juanita
that
very
day
and
i
sat
almost
trembling
with
impatience
though
issuing
a
dozen
warnings
to
myself
to
betray
nothing
to
keep
every
sense
alert
so
that
i
might
turn
the
interview
to
my
own
advantage
at
last
there
was
a
knock
on
the
door
bill
opened
it
and
the
slim
figure
of
the
man
i
had
rescued
glided
in
they
had
dried
his
clothes
he
even
wore
his
little
skull
cap
which
had
apparently
stuck
to
his
head
while
he
was
in
the
water
and
i
had
the
opportunity
of
seeing
him
in
the
light
for
the
first
time
instead
of
the
flat
tartar
nose
i
saw
one
boldly
aquiline
with
large
narrow
nostrils
his
eyes
were
almond
shaped
but
lustrous
and
full
of
fire
about
the
lips
which
had
no
trace
of
sensuality
but
were
beautifully
cut
there
was
a
kind
of
serene
pathos
i
find
it
difficult
to
describe
in
any
other
way
the
whole
face
was
noble
in
contour
and
in
expression
though
the
general
impression
it
gave
was
one
of
unutterable
sadness
dress
him
how
you
might
meet
him
where
you
would
there
was
no
possibility
of
mistaking
for
anything
but
a
gentleman
of
high
degree
the
door
closed
and
i
rose
from
my
seat
and
held
out
my
hand
well
i
said
this
is
a
bit
of
orlright
sir
and
i
glad
to
see
you
so
well
recovered
morning
we
have
the
law
on
them
dirty
rascals
that
assaulted
you
i
put
on
the
accent
thickly
flashed
my
diamond
ring
at
him
in
short
for
this
might
well
be
a
game
of
touch
and
go
and
i
had
a
deep
secret
to
preserve
he
put
his
long
thin
hand
in
mine
gripped
it
and
then
suddenly
turned
it
over
so
that
the
backs
of
my
fingers
were
uppermost
it
was
an
odd
thing
to
do
and
i
wondered
what
it
meant
oh
landlord
of
the
swan
of
gold
he
piped
in
his
curious
voice
sorting
out
his
words
as
he
went
on
i
owe
you
my
unworthy
life
which
is
nothing
in
itself
and
which
i
do
value
save
only
for
a
certain
opportunity
which
remains
to
it
and
is
a
private
matter
but
i
owe
my
life
to
your
courage
and
strength
and
flowering
kindness
and
i
come
to
put
myself
in
your
hands
really
he
was
making
a
damn
lot
of
fuss
about
nothing
look
here
i
said
that
all
right
you
would
have
done
as
much
for
me
now
let
sit
down
and
have
a
peg
and
a
chat
i
can
put
you
up
for
the
rest
of
the
night
you
know
and
i
shall
be
awfully
glad
to
do
it
he
looked
as
if
he
was
going
to
make
more
speeches
but
i
cut
him
short
as
for
putting
your
life
in
my
hands
i
said
we
do
talk
like
that
in
england
he
sat
down
and
a
faint
smile
came
upon
his
tired
lips
and
do
the
keepers
in
england
have
hands
such
as
yours
are
he
said
gently
sir
your
hands
are
white
they
are
also
shaped
in
a
certain
way
and
your
nails
are
not
even
in
mourning
for
your
profession
i
cursed
myself
savagely
as
he
mocked
me
bill
had
pointed
out
over
and
over
again
that
i
ought
to
use
a
nail
brush
too
frequently
it
in
the
part
but
i
always
forgot
it
to
hide
my
confusion
i
moved
a
little
table
towards
him
on
which
was
a
box
of
excellent
cigarettes
unfortunately
also
on
the
table
was
a
little
pocket
edition
of
shakespeare
with
which
i
used
to
solace
the
drab
hours
he
picked
it
up
opened
it
plump
at
romeo
and
juliet
the
play
which
for
reasons
known
to
you
i
most
affected
at
the
time
and
looked
up
at
me
with
gentle
eyes
households
both
alike
in
dignity
in
fair
verona
he
said
my
brain
was
working
like
a
mill
i
could
not
make
the
fellow
out
what
did
he
know
what
did
he
suspect
well
the
best
thing
was
to
ask
him
outright
you
mean
he
became
distressed
at
once
you
speak
harshly
to
me
o
my
preserver
i
meant
but
that
i
knew
at
once
that
you
are
not
born
in
the
position
in
which
i
see
you
perhaps
you
will
give
me
your
kind
leave
to
explain
in
my
native
country
i
am
of
high
hereditary
rank
though
i
am
poor
enough
and
occupy
a
somewhat
menial
position
here
my
honorable
name
honorable
sir
is
which
will
convey
nothing
to
you
during
the
rebellion
of
twenty
years
ago
in
china
my
ancestral
house
was
destroyed
and
as
a
child
i
was
rescued
and
sent
to
europe
for
many
years
the
peasants
of
my
province
scraped
their
little
earnings
together
and
a
sum
sufficient
to
support
me
in
my
studies
was
sent
to
me
in
paris
i
speak
the
french
spanish
and
english
languages
i
am
a
bachelor
of
science
of
the
london
university
and
my
one
hope
and
aim
in
life
is
and
has
been
to
acquire
sufficient
money
to
return
to
the
tombs
of
my
ancestors
on
the
banks
of
the
there
to
live
a
quiet
life
much
resembling
that
of
an
english
country
squire
until
i
also
fade
away
into
the
unknown
and
become
part
of
the
absolute
there
was
something
perfectly
charming
about
him
since
he
spotted
i
was
a
second
edition
of
the
honest
fool
since
he
had
somehow
or
other
divined
that
i
was
an
educated
man
i
felt
drawn
to
him
you
must
remember
that
for
months
now
the
only
person
i
had
had
to
talk
to
was
bill
rolston
and
all
the
time
he
was
so
occupied
in
our
tortuous
campaign
that
we
only
met
late
at
night
to
report
progress
for
a
moment
i
quite
forgot
what
this
new
friend
might
mean
to
me
and
opened
out
to
him
without
a
thought
of
further
advantage
i
was
a
fool
no
doubt
afterwards
talking
it
all
over
with
pat
moore
and
arthur
winstanley
i
saw
that
i
ran
a
great
risk
anyhow
i
reciprocated
confidence
as
well
as
i
could
i
awfully
glad
we
met
even
under
such
unfortunate
circumstances
you
are
quite
right
i
come
of
a
different
class
from
what
the
ordinary
frequenter
of
this
hotel
might
suppose
but
since
you
have
discovered
it
i
beg
you
to
keep
it
entirely
to
yourself
i
also
have
had
my
misfortunes
perhaps
i
also
am
longing
for
some
ultimate
happiness
or
triumph
out
of
the
box
he
took
a
cigarette
and
his
long
delicate
fingers
played
with
it
brother
he
said
i
understand
and
i
say
again
now
that
i
can
say
it
in
a
new
voice
my
life
is
yours
then
i
began
on
my
own
account
tell
me
i
said
of
yourself
many
of
your
come
here
the
lower
orders
and
they
all
employed
by
the
millionaire
gideon
morse
who
seems
to
prefer
the
men
of
china
to
any
other
you
also
are
connected
with
this
colossal
mystery
he
did
answer
for
a
moment
but
looked
down
at
the
glowing
end
of
his
cigarette
yes
he
replied
with
some
constraint
i
am
in
the
service
of
the
honorable
gideon
mendoza
morse
i
am
in
fact
his
private
secretary
and
through
me
his
instructions
are
conveyed
to
the
various
heads
of
departments
you
are
fortunate
i
suppose
that
before
long
you
will
be
able
to
fulfill
your
ambitions
and
retire
to
china
with
a
quick
glance
at
me
he
admitted
that
this
was
so
and
yet
i
said
thoughtfully
it
must
be
a
very
trying
service
despite
that
you
live
in
wonderland
in
a
city
of
enchantment
again
i
caught
a
swift
regard
and
he
leant
forward
in
his
chair
why
do
you
say
that
he
asked
i
hazarded
a
bold
shot
simply
because
the
man
is
mad
i
said
his
bright
eyes
narrowed
to
glittering
slits
you
quote
gossip
of
the
newspapers
he
replied
do
i
i
happen
to
know
more
than
the
newspapers
do
he
rose
to
his
feet
took
two
steps
towards
me
and
looked
down
with
a
twitching
face
who
you
he
said
and
his
whole
frail
frame
trembled
i
caught
him
firmly
by
the
arm
and
stared
into
his
face
god
knows
what
my
own
was
like
i
am
the
one
who
has
been
waiting
the
one
who
is
waiting
to
help
the
one
who
has
come
to
save
i
said
and
my
voice
was
not
my
own
it
was
as
if
the
words
were
put
into
my
mouth
by
an
outside
power
he
wrenched
his
arm
away
gave
a
little
cry
strode
to
the
mantelpiece
and
bent
his
head
upon
his
arms
his
whole
body
was
shaken
with
convulsive
sobs
i
stood
in
the
middle
of
the
room
watching
him
hardly
daring
to
breathe
feeling
that
my
heart
was
swelling
until
it
occupied
the
whole
of
my
body
at
length
he
looked
up
then
i
shall
be
of
some
use
to
her
after
all
he
said
this
is
too
much
honor
the
lily
of
white
jade
he
staggered
back
his
face
working
terribly
and
fell
in
a
huddled
heap
upon
the
floor
i
was
just
opening
my
mouth
to
call
for
rolston
when
there
came
a
thunderous
knocking
upon
the
side
door
of
the
house
i
ran
into
the
dimly
lit
passage
and
as
i
did
so
rolston
flitted
out
of
the
bar
door
and
stood
beside
me
i
have
heard
everything
he
whispered
but
what
what
is
this
he
pointed
to
the
door
and
as
he
did
so
there
was
again
the
thunder
of
the
knocker
and
the
whirr
of
the
electric
bell
hardly
knowing
what
i
did
i
shot
back
the
bolts
at
top
and
bottom
turned
the
heavy
key
in
its
lock
and
opened
the
door
outside
in
the
moonlight
a
figure
was
standing
a
man
in
a
heavy
fur
coat
carrying
a
suitcase
in
his
left
hand
what
the
devil
i
was
beginning
when
he
pushed
past
me
and
came
into
the
hall
then
i
saw
with
a
leap
of
all
my
pulses
that
it
was
lord
arthur
winstanley
chapter
nine
it
was
four
in
the
morning
a
bitter
wind
had
risen
and
was
wailing
around
the
golden
swan
interspersed
with
heavy
storms
of
hail
which
rattled
on
roof
and
windows
outside
the
tempest
shrieked
and
was
accompanied
by
a
vast
humming
noise
as
it
flung
itself
against
the
of
the
towers
and
vibrated
over
richmond
like
a
chorus
of
giant
æolian
harps
arthur
and
i
sat
in
the
shabby
which
had
been
the
theater
of
so
much
emotion
that
night
and
stared
at
each
other
with
troubled
faces
there
was
a
little
pattering
noise
and
bill
rolston
came
in
closing
the
door
carefully
behind
him
he
wants
you
to
go
up
to
him
sir
thomas
you
told
me
to
use
my
own
discretion
since
we
carried
him
up
and
i
gave
him
the
bromides
i
have
left
his
bedside
i
talked
to
him
in
his
own
language
but
he
would
say
a
word
until
i
threw
off
every
disguise
and
told
him
who
i
really
was
and
who
you
were
also
but
rolston
you
may
have
spoiled
everything
he
shook
his
head
you
do
know
what
i
know
now
that
he
aware
you
are
of
his
own
rank
and
that
i
am
your
lieutenant
his
life
is
absolutely
your
forfeit
if
you
were
to
tell
him
to
commit
suicide
he
would
do
it
at
once
as
the
most
natural
thing
in
the
world
to
preserve
his
honor
he
is
your
man
from
this
moment
sir
thomas
just
as
i
am
then
i
go
up
arthur
you
do
mind
mind
i
thought
i
brought
a
into
your
house
and
so
i
have
too
but
to
find
all
this
going
on
simply
robs
me
of
speech
meanwhile
if
you
will
introduce
me
to
this
asiatic
gentleman
who
speaks
such
excellent
english
and
whom
from
repute
i
guess
to
be
william
rolston
i
daresay
we
can
amuse
ourselves
during
the
remainder
of
this
astonishing
night
and
he
continued
if
there
is
such
a
thing
as
a
ham
upon
the
premises
some
thick
slices
grilled
upon
this
excellent
fire
and
some
cool
ale
in
a
pewter
i
left
them
to
it
and
went
upstairs
to
my
chamber
it
was
lit
with
two
or
three
candles
in
silver
holders
i
had
made
the
place
quite
habitable
by
now
and
lying
on
my
bed
covered
with
an
eiderdown
his
eyes
feverish
his
face
flushed
lay
the
mandarin
his
eyes
opened
and
he
smiled
it
was
the
first
time
i
had
seen
the
delicate
melancholy
lips
light
up
in
a
real
smile
what
that
for
i
said
as
i
sat
down
by
the
bedside
you
are
so
big
and
strong
prince
he
replied
and
large
and
confident
and
your
disguise
fell
from
you
as
you
came
in
and
i
saw
you
as
you
were
i
knelt
beside
the
bed
and
my
breath
came
thick
and
fast
for
god
sake
do
play
with
me
i
said
not
that
you
are
doing
that
you
have
met
her
miss
morse
i
mean
my
juanita
prince
she
has
deigned
to
give
me
her
confidence
in
some
degree
i
do
my
work
in
the
wonderful
library
that
morse
has
built
it
a
great
hall
full
of
the
rarest
volumes
and
there
are
long
windows
from
which
one
can
look
down
upon
london
and
gaze
beyond
the
city
to
where
the
wrinkled
sea
beats
around
the
coast
and
day
by
day
in
her
loneliness
the
fairest
of
maidens
has
come
to
this
high
place
and
taken
a
book
of
poems
sat
in
the
embrasure
and
stared
down
at
the
world
below
he
raised
a
thin
hand
and
held
it
upright
it
was
so
transparent
that
the
light
of
a
candle
behind
turned
it
to
blood
red
let
my
presumptuous
desires
be
forever
silent
he
chanted
is
east
and
west
is
west
and
i
erred
gravely
but
worship
is
worship
and
worship
is
sacrifice
i
could
hardly
speak
my
voice
was
hoarse
his
words
had
given
me
such
a
picture
of
juanita
up
there
in
the
clouds
prince
i
am
not
a
prince
i
only
have
a
very
ordinary
title
if
you
know
england
you
understand
what
a
baronet
is
i
know
england
prince
your
princess
is
waiting
for
you
and
sighing
out
her
heart
that
you
have
not
come
to
her
i
leapt
to
my
feet
and
swore
a
great
oath
that
made
the
attic
room
ring
mean
i
shouted
prince
the
lily
of
all
the
lilies
the
rose
of
all
the
roses
alone
distraught
another
ophelia
no
say
rather
juliet
with
her
nurse
has
honored
me
with
the
story
of
her
love
she
never
told
me
whom
she
longed
for
but
i
knew
that
it
was
some
one
down
in
the
world
i
staggered
out
a
question
it
is
my
humble
adoration
for
her
which
has
sharpened
all
my
wits
he
answered
it
seemed
an
accident
though
the
gods
designed
it
without
doubt
that
made
you
save
my
life
but
now
i
know
you
are
the
lover
of
the
lily
and
i
am
the
servant
the
happy
messenger
of
you
both
you
can
take
a
letter
from
me
to
her
indeed
yes
my
friend
tell
me
tell
me
all
about
her
is
she
happy
no
i
know
she
can
not
be
that
but
he
lifted
himself
up
in
the
bed
and
there
was
something
in
his
attitude
as
he
folded
his
thin
hands
upon
his
breast
and
spoke
two
thousand
feet
above
london
there
is
a
palace
of
all
delights
immeasurable
wealth
the
genius
of
great
artists
have
been
combined
to
make
a
city
of
enchantment
and
in
every
garden
with
its
plashing
fountains
in
its
halls
of
pictures
and
delights
upon
its
aerial
towers
down
its
gilded
galleries
lurking
at
the
banquet
mingling
with
the
music
great
shapes
of
terror
squeak
and
gibber
like
the
ghosts
shakespeare
speaks
of
in
ancient
rome
morse
there
is
a
noble
intellect
overdone
and
dissolved
in
terror
in
all
other
respects
sane
as
you
or
i
my
savior
and
benefactor
gideon
morse
is
a
maniac
whose
one
sole
idea
is
to
preserve
himself
and
his
daughter
from
some
horror
some
vengeance
which
surely
can
not
threaten
him
twice
thrice
i
strode
the
attic
then
at
last
i
stopped
will
you
help
me
now
will
you
take
a
letter
from
me
will
you
help
me
to
meet
her
and
soon
he
bowed
his
head
for
answer
and
then
as
he
looked
up
again
his
face
was
suffused
with
a
sort
of
bright
eagerness
that
touched
me
to
the
heart
i
am
yours
he
said
then
quickly
and
soon
for
you
are
only
half
informed
gideon
morse
may
be
driven
mad
by
fear
no
doubt
he
is
but
it
is
an
imaginary
fear
it
is
a
thing
so
sinister
so
real
and
terrible
that
i
can
not
tell
you
of
it
now
i
am
too
exhausted
by
the
events
of
this
night
i
will
say
only
this
that
within
the
last
hour
a
faithful
friend
of
mine
has
returned
from
the
other
side
of
the
world
and
brings
me
ominous
news
i
believe
that
whose
movements
were
of
course
not
restricted
like
those
of
the
lower
officials
returned
to
the
towers
in
the
early
morning
as
for
me
i
caught
a
workmen
train
from
richmond
station
slunk
in
an
early
taxi
to
piccadilly
with
arthur
winstanley
and
slipped
into
sheets
and
silence
till
past
noon
when
captain
patrick
moore
arrived
to
an
early
lunch
dressed
again
in
proper
clothes
with
dear
old
preston
fussing
about
me
with
tears
in
his
eyes
i
felt
a
thousand
times
more
confident
than
before
old
pat
had
to
be
informed
of
everything
and
as
a
preliminary
i
told
him
my
whole
story
from
the
of
the
golden
swan
and
now
i
said
here
arthur
who
has
traveled
thousands
of
miles
and
who
has
come
back
with
information
that
fits
in
absolutely
with
everything
else
he
gave
me
an
epitome
last
night
under
strange
and
fantastic
circumstances
now
then
arthur
let
have
it
all
clearly
and
then
we
shall
know
where
we
are
arthur
whose
face
was
white
and
strained
began
at
once
i
went
straight
to
rio
he
said
and
of
course
i
took
care
that
i
was
accredited
to
our
legation
as
a
matter
of
fact
the
minister
to
the
brazilian
government
is
my
cousin
the
news
about
the
towers
was
all
over
brazil
everybody
there
knows
gideon
mendoza
morse
he
been
by
a
long
way
the
most
picturesque
figure
in
south
america
during
the
last
twenty
years
he
has
been
president
of
the
republic
of
course
i
had
the
freshest
news
my
mother
had
given
a
party
to
introduce
juanita
to
london
society
i
had
danced
with
her
i
had
talked
to
her
father
i
was
the
young
english
society
man
who
brought
authentic
news
i
told
all
i
knew
and
a
good
bit
more
and
i
sucked
in
information
like
a
i
learnt
a
tremendous
lot
as
to
the
sources
of
enormous
wealth
i
was
glad
to
find
that
there
were
no
allegations
against
him
of
any
trust
methods
any
financial
tricks
he
had
got
rich
like
one
of
the
old
patriarchs
simply
by
shrewdness
and
long
accumulation
and
rising
values
but
i
had
to
go
a
good
deal
farther
back
than
this
i
had
to
dive
into
obscure
politics
of
south
america
and
then
it
was
almost
like
a
punch
on
the
jaw
i
stumbled
against
the
santa
hermandad
pat
moore
and
i
cried
out
simultaneously
what
on
earth
do
you
mean
our
league
it
sheer
coincidence
he
answered
i
hope
it
not
a
bad
omen
during
the
time
when
the
last
emperor
of
brazil
pedro
ii
was
reigning
it
was
seen
by
all
his
supporters
both
in
brazil
and
in
spain
that
his
power
was
waning
and
a
crash
was
sure
to
come
in
order
to
preserve
the
principle
of
the
monarchy
a
powerful
secret
society
was
started
under
the
name
of
the
holy
brotherhood
or
santa
hermandad
gideon
morse
then
a
young
and
very
influential
man
became
a
member
of
this
society
but
after
the
emperor
was
deposed
and
a
republic
declared
morse
threw
in
his
lot
with
the
new
régime
i
have
gathered
that
he
did
so
out
of
pure
patriotism
he
realized
that
a
republic
was
the
best
thing
for
his
country
and
had
no
personal
ax
to
grind
whatever
he
prospered
exceedingly
as
you
know
he
has
in
his
time
been
president
of
the
republica
dos
estados
unidos
de
brazil
and
has
contributed
more
to
the
success
of
the
country
than
any
other
man
living
fascinatin
study
history
said
captain
moore
for
those
that
like
it
personally
i
am
no
bookworm
cut
the
cackle
arthur
old
bean
and
come
to
the
peace
fool
said
arthur
if
you
ca
understand
what
i
say
tom
will
explain
to
you
later
though
i
be
as
short
as
i
can
he
turned
to
me
when
this
secret
society
failed
tom
the
hermandad
i
mean
it
dissolved
it
was
agreed
by
the
inner
circle
that
it
was
only
suspended
but
as
the
years
went
by
nearly
all
the
prominent
members
died
and
the
republic
became
an
assured
thing
but
a
few
years
ago
the
society
was
revived
not
with
any
real
hope
of
putting
an
emperor
on
the
throne
again
but
as
a
means
to
terrorism
and
blackmail
all
the
most
lawless
elements
of
spanish
south
america
became
affiliated
into
a
new
and
sinister
confederation
you
heard
of
the
power
of
the
camorra
in
italy
well
the
hermandad
in
brazil
is
like
that
at
the
present
time
it
has
ramifications
everywhere
the
police
are
becoming
powerless
to
cope
with
it
and
a
secret
reign
of
terror
goes
on
at
this
hour
these
people
have
made
a
dead
shot
for
gideon
morse
he
has
defied
them
for
a
long
time
but
their
power
has
grown
and
grown
i
understand
that
two
years
ago
the
hermandad
fished
out
of
obscurity
an
old
spanish
nobleman
the
marquis
da
silva
who
was
one
of
the
original
chivalrous
monarchists
he
was
about
the
only
surviving
member
of
the
old
fraternity
and
they
got
him
to
produce
its
constitutions
he
came
upon
the
scene
some
two
years
ago
and
morse
was
given
just
that
time
to
fall
in
with
the
plans
of
the
modern
society
or
be
assassinated
together
with
his
daughter
he
stopped
and
it
was
dear
old
pat
moore
who
shouted
with
comprehension
why
now
he
bellowed
sure
and
i
see
it
all
that
why
he
built
the
tower
of
babel
and
went
to
live
on
the
top
and
drag
his
daughter
with
him
so
that
these
sinn
feiners
should
not
get
at
yes
pat
you
seen
through
it
at
a
glance
said
arthur
with
a
private
grin
to
me
pat
was
tremendously
bucked
up
at
the
thought
that
he
had
solved
a
problem
which
had
been
puzzling
both
of
us
all
the
same
he
said
the
place
is
too
well
guarded
for
any
spanish
murderer
to
get
up
besides
tom
here
is
makin
all
his
arrangements
and
he
have
miss
juanita
out
of
it
in
no
time
the
circumstances
arthur
went
on
calmly
are
perfectly
well
known
to
a
few
people
at
the
head
of
the
government
in
brazil
i
had
a
long
and
intimate
conversation
with
don
francisco
torromé
minister
of
police
to
the
republic
he
told
me
that
the
hermandad
is
intensely
revengeful
wicked
and
unscrupulous
moreover
it
rich
and
money
would
be
allowed
to
stand
in
the
way
of
getting
at
morse
what
is
lacking
is
energy
these
people
make
the
most
complete
and
fiendish
plans
they
dream
the
most
fantastic
and
devilish
dreams
and
then
they
say
which
means
will
do
very
well
and
go
to
sleep
in
the
sun
then
after
all
morse
is
in
no
danger
i
cried
immensely
relieved
you
said
the
danger
was
real
but
you
spoke
figuratively
sorry
old
chap
not
a
bit
of
it
there
some
one
on
the
track
with
energy
enough
to
pull
the
lid
off
the
infernal
regions
if
necessary
in
short
the
hermandad
have
engaged
the
services
of
an
international
scoundrel
of
the
highest
intellectual
powers
a
man
without
remorse
an
artist
in
crime
i
should
say
and
most
chiefs
of
police
in
the
kingdoms
of
the
world
would
agree
with
me
the
most
dangerous
ruffian
at
large
you
seen
him
tom
i
pointed
him
out
to
you
at
a
little
soho
restaurant
where
we
dined
once
together
his
name
is
mark
antony
midwinter
and
traveled
from
brazil
together
with
a
friend
by
the
same
boat
that
i
then
he
must
be
in
london
now
said
pat
moore
with
the
air
of
announcing
another
great
discovery
but
look
here
i
cried
i
told
you
before
you
sailed
for
south
america
i
told
you
what
i
saw
at
the
ritz
hotel
that
night
it
was
the
very
same
man
mark
antony
midwinter
as
you
call
him
running
like
a
hare
from
old
morse
who
was
shooting
fireworks
round
him
with
a
smile
on
his
face
not
the
man
you
think
he
is
he
may
be
a
devil
but
that
night
he
was
a
devil
of
a
funk
wait
a
bit
my
son
said
arthur
i
have
thought
about
that
incident
rather
carefully
remember
that
morse
was
given
a
certain
time
in
which
to
come
in
line
and
join
the
hermandad
from
what
i
have
heard
of
the
punctilious
senile
marquis
da
silva
he
would
have
allowed
the
campaign
against
morse
to
be
started
a
moment
before
the
time
of
immunity
was
up
might
not
midwinter
at
that
time
quite
ignorant
that
the
towers
were
being
built
as
a
refuge
for
morse
have
tried
to
go
behind
his
own
employers
and
offer
to
betray
them
and
to
drop
the
whole
business
for
a
million
or
so
from
what
i
know
of
the
man
career
i
should
think
it
extremely
probable
i
whistled
arthur
seemed
to
have
penetrated
to
the
center
of
that
night
mystery
there
was
nothing
more
likely
i
could
imagine
the
whole
scene
the
panther
man
laying
his
cards
on
the
table
and
offering
to
save
morse
and
juanita
from
certain
death
morse
already
half
maddened
by
what
hung
over
him
chuckling
in
the
knowledge
that
he
had
built
an
impregnable
refuge
dismissing
the
scoundrel
with
utter
firmness
and
contempt
i
believe
you
hit
it
arthur
i
said
it
fits
in
like
the
last
bit
of
a
puzzle
i
pretty
sure
myself
but
even
now
you
do
know
all
quite
early
in
his
life
when
midwinter
he
the
last
of
the
staffordshire
midwinters
an
ancient
and
famous
family
was
expelled
from
harrow
he
went
out
to
south
america
morse
was
at
that
time
in
the
wilds
of
goyaz
where
he
was
developing
his
mines
there
was
a
futile
attempt
to
kidnap
the
child
juanita
who
was
then
about
two
years
old
and
midwinter
was
in
it
the
young
gentleman
i
understand
was
caught
morse
was
then
as
doubtless
he
is
now
a
man
of
a
grim
and
terrible
humor
he
took
young
midwinter
and
treated
him
with
every
possible
contemptuous
indignity
they
say
his
head
was
shaved
he
was
birched
like
a
schoolboy
by
peons
he
was
branded
tarred
and
feathered
and
turned
contemptuously
adrift
the
fellow
came
back
to
europe
married
a
celebrated
actress
in
paris
who
is
now
dead
and
has
been
as
i
say
one
of
the
most
successful
uncaught
members
of
the
higher
criminal
circles
that
ever
was
he
made
an
attempt
at
the
ritz
swallowing
his
hatred
it
failed
his
employers
in
brazil
know
nothing
of
it
he
is
here
in
london
as
pat
so
wonderfully
discovered
supplied
with
unlimited
money
burning
with
a
hatred
of
which
a
decent
man
can
have
no
conception
and
confronted
with
his
last
chance
in
the
world
as
he
said
this
arthur
got
up
bit
his
lip
savagely
and
left
the
room
it
was
about
in
the
afternoon
though
he
closed
the
door
after
him
i
heard
voices
in
the
corridor
and
the
door
reopened
an
inch
or
two
as
if
some
one
was
holding
it
before
coming
in
you
are
not
well
my
lord
oh
i
all
right
preston
just
feeling
a
little
faint
that
all
sorry
to
nearly
have
barged
into
you
i
go
and
lie
down
for
half
an
hour
the
door
opened
and
preston
came
in
with
a
telegram
i
opened
it
immediately
and
felt
three
or
four
flimsy
sheets
of
government
paper
in
my
hand
the
telegram
was
in
the
special
cipher
of
the
and
was
from
rolston
the
tower
top
is
connected
with
richmond
telephone
exchange
by
private
wire
i
have
been
rung
up
and
in
long
conversation
with
early
in
the
evening
you
will
receive
a
letter
from
certain
lady
owing
to
certain
complication
of
circumstances
your
attempt
at
storming
the
tower
and
seeing
lady
must
be
carried
out
our
friend
is
making
all
possible
arrangements
to
this
end
and
urgently
begs
you
to
be
prepared
he
implicitly
urges
me
to
warn
you
the
attempt
is
not
without
grave
danger
please
return
to
at
once
there
is
much
to
be
arranged
and
at
lunch
time
two
customers
were
in
the
bar
whose
appearance
i
did
like
at
all
also
sliddim
thinks
he
recognized
one
of
them
as
an
exceedingly
dangerous
person
for
at
last
the
patient
months
of
waiting
were
over
and
it
had
all
narrowed
down
to
this
i
should
win
or
lose
all
that
made
life
worth
living
and
the
fast
taxi
that
took
me
back
to
richmond
within
twenty
minutes
of
receiving
the
telegram
carried
a
man
singing
chapter
ten
the
wind
was
getting
up
on
richmond
hill
and
masses
of
cloud
were
scudding
from
the
south
and
obscuring
the
light
of
the
moon
when
at
about
nine
a
small
motor
coupé
drew
up
in
front
of
the
great
gate
at
the
tower
inclosure
the
small
car
was
painted
dead
black
the
man
who
drove
it
was
in
livery
and
a
person
in
a
fur
coat
stepped
out
and
pressed
the
electric
button
of
a
small
door
in
the
wall
by
the
side
of
the
huge
main
gates
in
his
hand
he
had
a
little
black
bag
in
a
moment
the
door
opened
a
few
inches
and
a
large
intelligent
face
could
be
seen
in
the
aperture
the
doctor
said
the
gentleman
from
the
coupé
the
door
opened
at
once
to
admit
him
he
turned
and
spoke
to
the
chauffeur
as
i
can
not
tell
you
how
long
i
shall
be
williams
he
said
you
had
better
go
back
to
the
surgery
and
wait
there
i
have
no
doubt
i
can
telephone
when
i
require
you
the
man
touched
his
cap
and
drove
off
and
the
doctor
found
himself
in
a
vaulted
passage
to
the
right
of
which
was
a
brightly
lit
room
standing
in
the
passage
and
bowing
was
a
gigantic
chinaman
the
keeper
of
the
gate
in
a
quilted
black
robe
lined
with
fur
the
man
bowed
low
and
a
second
chinaman
came
out
of
the
room
a
thin
person
ah
dr
thomas
he
said
we
been
expecting
you
i
am
secretary
to
morse
perhaps
you
will
come
this
way
he
led
the
doctor
down
the
passage
unlocked
a
further
door
and
the
two
men
emerged
into
the
grounds
proceeding
down
a
wide
graveled
road
bordered
by
strips
of
lawn
and
lit
at
intervals
with
electric
standards
in
the
distance
there
were
ranges
of
lit
buildings
with
figures
flitting
backwards
and
forwards
before
the
orange
oblongs
of
doors
and
windows
in
another
quarter
rose
the
lighted
dome
of
the
great
power
house
from
which
the
low
hum
of
dynamos
and
the
steady
throb
of
engines
could
be
faintly
heard
in
pauses
of
the
gale
it
was
exactly
like
standing
at
night
in
the
center
of
some
great
exhibition
grounds
save
that
straight
ahead
overshadowing
everything
and
covering
an
immense
area
of
ground
were
the
bases
of
the
three
great
towers
a
nightmare
of
fantastic
steel
tracery
such
as
no
man
eye
had
beheld
before
in
the
history
of
the
world
so
far
so
good
said
with
a
sigh
of
relief
that
was
excellently
managed
the
was
quite
in
keeping
your
wonderful
little
friend
who
speaks
my
language
so
well
is
already
in
the
compound
with
some
of
the
men
he
will
await
here
to
take
any
orders
that
may
be
necessary
i
was
trembling
with
excitement
and
could
hardly
reply
here
i
was
at
last
passed
into
the
forbidden
city
with
the
greatest
ease
we
will
walk
slowly
towards
tower
number
three
which
is
the
one
we
shall
ascend
said
my
companion
and
i
will
explain
the
situation
to
you
on
the
tower
top
i
have
supreme
authority
except
for
one
man
and
that
the
boss
mulligan
this
worthy
is
much
addicted
to
the
use
of
hot
and
rebellious
liquors
and
is
generally
more
or
less
intoxicated
about
this
time
though
he
is
more
alert
and
ferocious
than
when
sober
i
have
taken
the
opportunity
to
put
a
little
something
in
his
bottle
a
little
something
from
china
which
will
not
be
detected
and
which
will
by
now
have
sent
him
into
a
profound
drugged
slumber
i
then
telephoned
all
down
the
tower
to
the
lift
men
on
the
various
stages
and
also
to
kwang
there
that
a
doctor
was
to
be
expected
and
that
i
would
come
down
to
meet
him
and
conduct
him
to
mr
morse
excellent
i
said
and
now
now
we
are
going
straight
up
to
the
very
top
every
one
will
see
us
but
no
one
will
think
anything
strange
moreover
and
this
is
a
fact
in
our
favor
when
mulligan
awakes
no
one
will
be
able
to
tell
him
of
the
incident
even
if
they
suspected
anything
for
few
if
any
of
the
tower
men
speak
more
than
a
few
rudimentary
words
of
english
and
i
am
the
intermediary
between
them
and
their
master
this
was
specially
arranged
by
morse
so
that
none
of
them
could
get
into
communication
with
europeans
the
fact
is
greatly
in
our
favor
i
pressed
my
hand
to
a
pocket
over
my
heart
where
lay
a
little
note
which
had
been
mysteriously
conveyed
to
me
early
in
the
evening
a
little
agitated
note
bidding
me
come
at
all
costs
and
passed
on
in
silence
until
we
came
under
the
gloomy
shadows
of
the
mighty
girders
and
columns
which
sprang
up
from
an
expanse
of
smooth
concrete
which
seemed
to
stretch
as
far
as
eye
could
reach
we
changed
our
lift
at
each
stage
and
i
could
have
wished
that
it
was
day
or
the
night
was
finer
for
the
experience
is
wonderful
when
one
undergoes
it
for
the
first
time
we
shall
ascend
by
one
of
the
small
rapid
lifts
built
for
four
or
five
persons
only
and
not
the
large
and
more
cumbrous
machines
even
so
you
must
remember
doctor
he
chuckled
as
he
called
me
that
we
have
nearly
half
a
mile
to
go
on
and
on
we
went
amid
this
lifeless
forest
of
steel
with
its
smooth
concrete
and
shining
until
at
last
we
approached
a
small
illuminated
pavilion
where
two
silent
celestials
awaited
us
we
stepped
into
the
lift
the
door
was
closed
a
bell
rang
and
we
began
to
move
upwards
i
sat
down
on
a
seat
and
did
attempt
to
look
out
of
the
frosted
windows
on
either
side
until
at
length
after
what
seemed
an
interminable
time
we
stopped
with
a
little
jerk
opened
the
door
and
led
me
down
on
to
a
platform
we
are
now
he
said
on
the
first
stage
just
fifty
feet
higher
than
the
golden
cross
on
the
top
of
saint
paul
if
you
will
come
up
this
slant
see
here
the
next
lift
i
followed
him
along
a
steel
platform
for
some
twenty
or
thirty
yards
the
wind
whistling
all
around
on
looking
to
the
right
i
saw
nothing
but
a
black
void
at
the
bottom
of
which
far
far
below
was
the
yellow
glow
of
richmond
town
on
looking
to
the
left
i
stopped
for
a
moment
and
stared
unable
to
believe
my
eyes
as
i
live
there
was
an
immense
lake
there
surrounded
by
rushes
that
sang
and
swished
in
the
wind
with
a
and
a
little
then
with
a
clang
of
wings
and
a
chorus
of
shrill
quacks
a
gaggle
of
wild
duck
got
up
and
sped
away
into
the
dark
yes
said
that
the
lake
there
are
many
variety
of
water
fowl
fed
there
who
make
it
their
home
on
a
quiet
afternoon
walking
round
the
margin
or
in
a
canoe
one
can
feel
ten
thousand
miles
away
from
london
but
that
nothing
to
what
you
will
see
if
circumstances
permit
i
have
but
a
dim
recollection
of
the
second
stage
which
was
only
a
stage
in
the
particular
tower
we
were
mounting
and
did
not
extend
between
the
three
as
the
lower
and
two
upper
ones
did
forming
the
immense
plateaus
of
which
the
lake
was
one
and
the
city
in
the
clouds
itself
another
it
was
when
we
had
slowed
down
and
even
in
the
dark
lift
that
i
began
to
have
a
curious
sensation
of
an
immense
immeasurable
height
and
gave
me
a
warning
look
as
who
would
say
now
get
ready
the
adventure
really
begins
we
stopped
the
door
slid
back
and
immediately
we
were
in
a
blaze
of
light
we
were
no
longer
out
of
doors
the
lift
had
come
up
through
the
floor
of
a
large
room
it
was
divided
into
two
portions
by
polished
steel
bars
extending
from
ceiling
to
floor
a
cat
could
not
have
squeezed
through
on
our
side
the
lift
side
the
floor
was
covered
with
matting
but
there
was
no
furniture
at
all
beyond
the
bars
were
a
turkey
carpet
several
armchairs
a
mahogany
table
with
bottles
siphons
newspapers
and
a
large
automatic
pistol
an
electric
fire
burned
cheerily
in
one
corner
and
at
right
angles
to
it
was
a
couch
upon
this
couch
and
snoring
like
a
bull
lay
mulligan
huge
relaxed
helpless
good
heavens
i
whispered
gideon
morse
is
safe
enough
here
in
ten
seconds
whispered
by
pressing
that
bell
button
mulligan
could
have
the
room
full
of
armed
guards
and
as
you
see
this
steel
fence
is
impassable
without
the
key
there
are
only
three
keys
of
which
i
have
one
he
produced
it
as
he
spoke
inserting
it
in
a
gleaming
complicated
lock
slid
back
a
portion
of
the
and
we
stepped
into
the
we
are
now
said
my
guide
on
the
platform
immediately
under
that
on
which
the
city
rests
and
about
a
hundred
feet
below
it
this
platform
is
entirely
occupied
by
this
a
range
of
store
and
dwelling
houses
the
elaborate
electric
installation
power
for
which
is
supplied
from
below
turkish
baths
a
swimming
bath
and
so
forth
please
follow
me
with
a
glance
of
repulsion
at
the
drugged
giant
on
the
couch
i
went
after
through
a
door
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
room
and
down
a
long
corridor
with
windows
on
one
side
and
arched
recesses
on
the
other
at
the
end
of
this
we
came
out
again
into
the
open
air
that
is
to
say
that
we
were
shielded
by
walls
and
buildings
walking
as
it
were
in
a
sleeping
town
upon
streets
paved
with
wood
blocks
while
instead
of
the
vault
of
heaven
above
about
the
height
of
a
tallish
church
tower
were
the
great
beams
and
girders
which
supported
the
city
itself
and
from
which
at
regular
intervals
hung
arc
lamps
which
threw
a
blue
and
stilly
radiance
upon
the
streets
and
roofs
of
the
buildings
it
was
colossal
amazing
this
great
colony
in
the
sky
now
and
then
we
heard
voices
the
rattle
of
dice
thrown
upon
a
board
and
the
wailing
music
of
chinese
violins
two
or
three
times
silent
figures
passed
us
with
a
low
bow
and
without
a
glimmer
of
curiosity
in
their
impassive
faces
until
at
length
we
came
to
a
long
row
of
lift
doors
with
an
inscription
above
each
one
and
in
the
center
dividing
them
into
sections
a
large
vaulted
stairway
mounting
upwards
till
it
was
lost
to
sight
it
was
lined
with
white
tiles
like
a
subway
in
some
great
railway
terminus
unlocked
the
door
of
a
small
lift
we
got
into
it
it
rushed
up
for
a
few
seconds
and
then
we
came
out
of
a
small
white
kiosk
upon
a
scene
so
wonderful
so
enchanted
that
i
forgot
all
else
for
a
second
caught
hold
of
my
conductor
thin
arm
and
gave
a
cry
of
admiration
and
wonder
a
mass
of
clouds
had
just
raced
before
the
moon
leaving
it
free
to
shed
its
light
until
another
should
envelop
it
the
pure
radiance
unspoiled
by
smoke
mist
or
the
miasma
which
hangs
above
the
roofs
of
earthly
cities
poured
down
in
floods
of
light
upon
a
vast
quadrangle
of
buildings
white
as
snow
and
with
roofs
that
seemed
of
gold
i
had
the
impression
of
immensity
though
magnified
a
dozen
times
that
the
great
quadrangle
of
christ
church
oxford
or
the
court
of
trinity
cambridge
give
to
one
who
sees
them
for
the
first
time
but
that
impression
was
only
fleeting
these
buildings
seemed
to
obey
no
architectural
law
they
were
tossed
up
like
foam
in
the
upper
air
marvelous
fantastic
beautiful
beyond
words
we
hurried
along
by
the
side
of
a
great
green
lawn
which
might
have
been
a
century
growing
past
bronze
dragons
supporting
fountain
basins
down
an
arcade
where
the
broad
leaves
of
palms
clicked
together
and
there
was
a
scent
of
roses
until
we
hurried
through
a
little
postern
door
and
up
some
steps
and
came
out
in
what
whispered
was
the
library
wonder
upon
wonders
my
brain
reeled
as
we
stepped
out
of
the
door
in
the
wall
into
a
great
gothic
room
with
groined
roof
of
stone
an
oriel
window
at
one
end
and
thousands
upon
thousands
of
books
in
the
embayed
shelves
of
ancient
oak
it
was
exactly
like
the
library
of
some
great
college
or
castle
one
expected
to
see
learned
men
in
gowns
and
hoods
moving
slowly
from
shelf
to
shelf
or
writing
at
this
or
that
table
but
but
i
stammered
this
might
have
been
here
for
seven
hundred
years
and
indeed
there
was
all
the
deep
scholastic
charm
and
dignity
of
one
of
the
great
libraries
of
the
past
for
answer
he
turned
to
me
and
i
saw
that
his
thin
hand
clutched
at
his
heart
it
all
illusion
he
whispered
all
cunning
and
wonderful
illusion
the
walls
of
this
place
are
not
of
ancient
stone
they
are
plates
of
toughened
steel
the
old
oak
was
made
yesterday
at
great
expense
is
all
a
picture
in
a
dream
i
saw
that
he
was
powerfully
affected
for
a
moment
but
for
just
that
moment
i
did
not
understand
why
but
the
books
i
cried
looking
round
me
in
amazement
surely
the
books
ah
yes
he
sighed
they
are
the
collection
of
gideon
morse
which
is
second
to
very
few
in
the
world
they
were
all
brought
over
from
rio
nearly
two
years
ago
we
can
not
compete
with
the
british
museum
or
some
of
the
great
american
collectors
in
certain
ways
but
there
are
treasures
here
we
had
by
now
walked
up
the
great
hall
he
stopped
went
to
part
of
the
wall
covered
with
books
withdrew
one
turned
a
little
handle
which
its
absence
revealed
and
a
whole
section
of
the
shelves
swung
outwards
in
here
please
said
this
is
a
little
room
where
i
sometimes
do
secretarial
work
at
any
rate
it
is
hidden
and
you
will
be
quite
safe
here
while
i
go
to
the
señorita
and
tell
her
that
you
await
her
the
door
clicked
i
sat
down
on
a
low
couch
and
waited
the
experiences
of
the
night
had
been
so
strange
the
intense
longing
of
months
seemed
now
so
near
fruition
that
every
artery
in
my
body
pulsed
and
drummed
and
it
was
only
by
a
tremendous
effort
of
will
that
i
sat
down
and
forced
myself
to
think
here
i
was
at
her
own
invitation
to
rescue
my
love
as
my
mind
began
to
work
i
saw
that
i
must
be
guided
in
my
course
of
action
by
what
she
told
me
juanita
obviously
thought
that
her
father
aberration
was
a
form
of
madness
without
foundation
she
did
not
know
what
i
had
discovered
if
she
did
she
might
realize
that
her
father
was
possibly
not
so
mad
as
she
imagined
for
myself
after
this
space
of
time
i
can
say
that
i
was
very
seriously
disturbed
by
arthur
revelations
in
regard
to
the
unspeakable
midwinter
and
the
news
that
he
was
now
in
england
perhaps
you
will
remember
that
in
bill
telegram
to
me
he
hinted
at
some
suspicious
strangers
having
been
seen
in
the
private
bar
of
the
golden
swan
one
of
them
i
had
ascertained
answered
to
the
description
of
midwinter
in
every
detail
and
the
two
men
were
seen
by
sliddim
to
drive
away
through
richmond
park
in
a
large
private
car
certainly
i
must
tell
juanita
something
of
this
and
help
her
to
warn
her
father
perhaps
and
then
i
remembered
the
elaborate
precautions
of
my
ascent
the
literal
impossibility
of
any
stranger
or
strangers
ever
getting
to
where
i
was
and
i
breathed
again
the
place
one
could
call
it
a
room
in
which
i
sat
was
simply
a
little
sexagonal
nook
or
retreat
masked
from
the
great
library
by
its
great
door
of
books
three
of
the
panels
which
went
from
the
floor
to
the
vaulted
ceiling
were
of
dead
black
silk
the
other
three
were
of
chinese
embroidery
stiff
with
raised
gold
and
gems
which
i
realized
must
be
from
the
choicest
examples
of
their
kind
in
the
world
still
i
was
interested
in
dragons
of
tarnished
gold
with
opal
eyes
ivory
teeth
and
scales
of
lapislazuli
i
was
getting
restive
when
the
black
panel
which
was
the
back
of
the
entrance
door
swung
towards
me
and
i
saw
juanita
she
was
dressed
in
black
a
sort
of
i
suppose
you
call
it
though
round
her
shoulders
and
falling
on
each
side
of
her
slim
form
was
a
cloak
of
heavy
sable
in
her
hair
oh
my
dear
how
true
you
were
then
to
the
fashions
of
the
south
and
how
true
you
are
there
was
a
glowing
crimson
rose
we
stood
and
looked
at
each
other
in
this
tiny
room
for
i
suppose
two
or
three
seconds
what
juanita
felt
she
told
me
afterwards
and
it
is
part
of
this
narrative
what
i
felt
was
awe
sheer
impersonal
awe
as
i
realized
that
i
had
surmounted
incredible
difficulties
endured
ages
of
longing
plotting
planning
and
now
stood
alone
in
front
of
the
most
beautiful
girl
in
the
world
i
saw
her
as
that
i
remembered
the
night
at
lady
brentford
when
the
league
was
formed
and
then
thank
heaven
for
in
another
second
everything
might
have
been
quite
spoiled
i
remembered
that
she
was
just
my
juanita
who
had
sent
for
me
and
i
took
her
in
my
arms
and
and
we
sat
hand
in
hand
upon
the
odd
little
chinese
couch
now
look
here
darling
i
said
you
told
me
all
about
your
governor
how
he
says
that
you
must
live
up
here
in
this
extraordinary
place
and
never
go
into
the
world
again
you
think
him
mad
and
yet
know
i
do
but
my
heart
i
got
to
tell
you
dearest
that
he
has
more
reason
than
you
think
she
shrugged
her
shoulders
it
was
about
the
most
graceful
thing
i
had
ever
seen
in
my
life
but
to
tell
me
that
i
am
to
be
a
nun
because
if
i
were
to
go
back
into
the
world
my
life
would
be
worth
a
moment
purchase
it
is
madness
it
can
not
be
anything
else
i
did
quite
know
how
to
tell
her
and
i
was
considering
when
she
went
on
it
is
getting
dreadful
father
can
not
sleep
he
prowls
about
this
nightmare
of
a
place
all
the
night
long
sweetheart
i
said
i
been
making
all
sorts
of
inquiries
and
found
out
that
your
governor
is
really
in
serious
danger
of
assassination
or
was
until
he
built
this
place
to
which
i
think
the
devil
could
hardly
penetrate
without
an
invitation
do
think
your
father
a
coward
remember
what
we
saw
that
night
in
the
ritz
hotel
when
i
was
just
about
to
tell
you
that
i
adored
you
no
i
lay
long
odds
juanita
darling
that
morse
is
more
afraid
for
you
than
for
himself
and
there
i
back
him
up
every
time
she
laughed
and
her
laughter
was
like
water
falling
into
water
in
paradise
i
have
you
she
said
i
have
father
what
do
i
care
quite
so
i
replied
i
think
you
take
a
very
sensible
view
of
it
the
obvious
thing
to
do
is
to
relieve
your
father
by
coming
with
me
while
the
coast
is
clear
lady
brentford
is
in
town
she
will
be
delighted
to
receive
you
once
out
of
the
place
we
can
be
free
within
an
hour
morning
i
can
get
a
special
license
from
the
archbishop
of
canterbury
and
we
can
be
married
once
that
happens
i
defy
all
the
santa
hermandads
and
all
the
mark
antony
midwinters
in
the
world
to
hurt
you
and
as
for
morse
protect
him
too
in
a
far
more
sensible
way
than
i
suppose
i
had
been
holding
her
rather
tightly
at
any
rate
she
broke
away
and
stood
up
in
the
center
of
the
little
room
the
brightness
of
her
face
was
clouded
with
thought
i
had
not
risen
and
she
stared
down
at
me
with
great
smoldering
eyes
so
it
is
true
she
said
nodding
her
head
it
is
true
father
and
i
are
in
peril
after
all
names
escaped
you
just
now
i
think
i
have
heard
one
of
them
before
she
passed
her
hand
over
her
brow
like
some
one
awaking
from
sleep
and
i
watched
her
fascinated
oh
how
lovely
she
was
at
that
moment
my
dear
my
perfect
dear
but
i
can
not
run
away
with
you
and
be
married
stay
with
father
can
not
you
see
that
well
of
course
i
did
there
were
no
two
words
about
it
very
well
i
answered
little
lady
of
my
heart
i
stick
by
the
old
chap
too
crept
up
here
in
a
sort
of
underhand
way
but
not
for
underhand
reasons
after
all
i
just
as
much
right
to
love
you
as
anybody
else
in
this
world
i
took
her
by
her
sweet
hands
and
i
laughed
in
her
face
i
not
the
duke
of
perth
i
said
but
but
juanita
there
came
a
little
knocking
at
the
door
juanita
swirled
round
flung
up
her
arm
i
saw
her
sweet
face
glowing
for
an
instant
and
then
she
seemed
to
whirl
away
like
an
autumn
leaf
the
only
thing
i
could
possibly
do
was
to
light
a
cigarette
juanita
having
met
me
having
delivered
her
ultimatum
having
turned
me
into
a
jelly
flitted
away
quite
oblivious
of
the
fact
that
i
was
a
burglar
an
intruder
into
what
was
probably
the
most
guarded
and
secret
place
in
europe
at
that
moment
my
heart
sang
high
music
and
that
was
well
but
at
the
same
time
i
recognized
that
i
was
in
the
deuce
of
a
mess
and
had
planned
out
no
course
of
action
at
all
i
prayed
almost
audibly
for
but
nobody
came
there
i
was
in
the
sexagonal
room
with
the
gold
dragons
with
their
jeweled
eyes
leering
at
me
a
dull
anger
welled
up
within
me
on
every
side
mentally
as
well
as
physically
i
seemed
baffled
hemmed
in
i
determined
at
any
risk
to
myself
to
get
out
into
the
library
i
took
two
steps
towards
the
door
through
which
juanita
had
gone
when
i
heard
a
sharp
snap
just
behind
me
i
whipped
round
clutching
the
only
weapon
i
had
which
was
a
brass
in
the
side
pocket
of
my
coat
and
then
i
stood
absolutely
still
one
of
the
dragon
panels
had
rolled
up
like
a
theater
curtain
and
standing
in
what
appeared
to
be
the
end
of
a
passage
was
the
great
brute
mulligan
with
a
winchester
rifle
at
his
shoulder
covering
me
as
a
man
does
in
the
presence
of
imminent
danger
i
swerved
out
of
the
line
of
the
deadly
barrel
as
i
did
so
click
a
second
panel
disappeared
and
i
was
confronted
by
gideon
morse
his
hands
in
the
pockets
of
his
dinner
jacket
his
mouth
faintly
smiling
his
eyes
inscrutable
imagine
it
let
the
picture
appear
to
you
of
the
fool
thomas
kirby
trapped
like
a
rat
once
twice
i
swallowed
in
my
throat
and
i
swear
it
was
from
fear
but
only
from
an
enormous
immeasurable
disgust
i
turned
to
morse
you
been
listening
i
said
you
and
your
servant
here
i
have
been
listening
sir
thomas
kirby
that
true
i
have
every
right
to
when
a
man
breaks
into
my
house
without
my
knowledge
and
makes
clandestine
love
to
my
daughter
he
not
the
person
to
accuse
one
of
eavesdropping
as
for
my
servant
there
you
do
me
an
injustice
which
i
find
harder
to
forgive
than
anything
when
you
suggest
that
i
allowed
him
to
overhear
what
passed
in
this
room
just
now
he
was
not
at
his
post
until
juanita
had
been
gone
from
here
some
seconds
mulligan
you
can
go
now
sir
thomas
please
come
with
me
into
the
library
there
was
something
so
magnetic
about
this
strange
and
compelling
personality
that
i
followed
him
without
a
word
then
you
knew
i
asked
in
a
husky
voice
you
knew
all
the
time
he
smiled
yes
he
said
i
arranged
a
little
comedy
the
faithful
mulligan
was
not
drugged
at
all
and
i
did
everything
to
facilitate
your
entrance
then
that
treacherous
cur
was
playing
with
me
the
whole
time
and
yet
i
could
have
sworn
that
he
was
genuine
when
i
meet
him
you
will
shake
hands
with
him
if
you
are
a
wise
man
was
absolutely
genuine
but
he
in
common
with
my
daughter
knew
nothing
of
the
truth
until
you
told
it
him
he
had
believed
me
a
madman
then
he
understood
not
only
the
peril
in
which
i
was
and
am
but
also
that
of
my
daughter
do
you
think
kirby
that
i
should
have
built
these
towers
let
imagination
transcend
itself
made
myself
the
cynosure
of
europe
unless
i
was
sure
of
what
i
was
doing
now
alas
you
told
juanita
and
brought
terror
into
her
life
as
well
as
mine
sir
i
said
her
relief
is
greater
than
any
fear
i
answer
for
that
i
faced
him
fair
and
square
god
knows
i
said
i
not
worth
a
single
glance
of
her
sweet
eyes
but
somehow
or
other
she
loves
me
though
she
would
fly
with
me
when
i
suggested
it
she
has
some
decent
feeling
left
he
answered
with
a
dry
chuckle
well
i
overheard
everything
that
passed
in
that
little
room
and
i
must
say
i
rather
appreciate
the
way
in
which
you
behaved
you
are
a
rapid
thinker
sir
thomas
what
suggests
itself
to
you
as
the
next
move
in
our
relations
quite
obvious
sir
you
give
your
consent
to
my
engagement
with
your
daughter
you
please
her
you
bind
me
to
your
interests
by
hoops
of
steel
though
as
a
matter
of
fact
i
bound
already
and
you
add
a
not
invaluable
auxiliary
to
your
staff
very
well
he
said
perfectly
calmly
and
held
out
his
hand
now
come
and
have
some
supper
and
tell
me
all
you
know
then
that
astonishing
man
thrust
his
arm
through
mine
and
led
me
down
the
great
library
what
a
marvelous
intellect
that
fellow
has
he
said
confidentially
he
saw
the
situation
in
all
its
bearings
from
all
sides
at
once
and
made
an
instant
decision
i
tell
you
now
kirby
that
he
actually
predicted
every
detail
of
what
has
just
come
to
pass
he
told
me
that
he
owed
you
his
life
and
was
perfectly
ready
to
die
for
you
as
of
course
for
me
and
my
daughter
but
that
it
had
occurred
to
him
that
his
living
for
all
three
of
us
might
be
by
far
the
wisest
attitude
to
adopt
under
the
circumstances
i
quite
agree
with
him
then
again
came
the
little
dry
strange
chuckle
but
no
more
peddling
to
my
chinese
my
boy
it
plays
the
devil
with
their
nerves
in
the
end
chapter
eleven
morse
and
i
sat
at
supper
in
a
room
which
differed
in
no
way
from
the
ordinary
study
of
a
country
gentleman
except
for
the
very
slightest
suggestion
rather
than
sensation
of
vibration
which
my
host
explained
was
the
drag
of
the
city
on
the
three
great
towers
which
perpetually
oscillated
out
of
the
perpendicular
and
so
insured
the
safety
of
the
vast
elastic
structure
there
was
nothing
to
indicate
that
we
were
two
thousand
two
hundred
feet
up
in
the
air
our
meal
was
of
the
simplest
and
during
it
i
told
morse
without
reservation
all
that
i
had
heard
from
arthur
winstanley
he
has
the
outline
very
correctly
i
fill
it
in
later
how
long
has
lord
arthur
been
in
london
about
five
days
i
believe
time
for
many
preparations
to
be
made
if
they
going
to
strike
quickly
he
said
more
to
himself
than
to
me
drumming
his
fingers
on
the
tablecloth
then
he
looked
up
and
these
two
men
who
were
seen
in
the
bar
of
your
public
house
one
sir
was
undoubtedly
midwinter
my
very
informant
describes
the
other
man
as
a
swarthy
person
of
just
over
middle
height
and
apparently
of
great
personal
strength
he
was
bearded
and
had
somewhat
the
appearance
of
a
zorilla
y
toro
as
i
expected
said
morse
zorilla
the
bull
as
he
is
known
in
half
the
republics
of
south
america
no
doubt
i
remarked
a
formidable
pair
of
ruffians
but
remember
that
i
saw
you
deal
with
one
of
them
at
any
rate
that
night
at
the
ritz
hotel
the
way
he
legged
it
out
of
the
would
have
inspired
me
with
any
particular
fear
of
him
morse
struck
the
table
with
his
hand
i
wish
i
sent
a
bullet
through
his
heart
instead
of
playing
fancy
fireworks
round
him
but
i
feared
london
and
your
colossal
law
and
order
it
perfectly
true
he
did
influence
me
in
the
least
on
that
night
he
came
to
sell
his
employers
to
sell
the
hermandad
for
a
hundred
thousand
pounds
it
would
have
been
cheaper
than
this
i
waved
my
hand
to
indicate
the
expensive
of
my
future
morse
laughed
it
would
have
made
the
least
difference
he
said
the
man
hurt
me
at
the
time
because
he
had
to
obey
the
orders
of
the
villainous
society
at
his
back
the
old
marquis
da
silva
who
is
simply
a
tool
in
their
hands
insisted
that
i
was
not
to
be
even
interfered
with
in
any
way
until
the
two
years
of
grace
from
my
first
warning
were
up
though
their
object
was
to
get
hold
of
half
my
fortune
and
midwinter
to
revenge
himself
personally
upon
me
the
society
and
he
did
dare
do
anything
until
the
moment
struck
there
were
too
many
political
issues
still
involved
that
why
i
made
mark
antony
midwinter
dance
out
of
the
ritz
hotel
on
that
night
it
what
arthur
winstanley
said
that
young
man
will
go
far
now
kirby
i
think
you
understand
everything
and
you
got
to
throw
in
your
lot
with
juanita
and
me
for
a
time
at
any
rate
and
never
say
you
did
know
what
you
were
up
against
i
took
a
glass
of
claret
and
lit
a
cigarette
i
understand
the
as
you
say
but
i
do
understand
you
allowing
for
all
your
natural
and
deep
anxiety
about
juanita
i
simply
fail
to
understand
why
you
regard
this
midwinter
and
his
companion
or
companions
with
such
apprehension
surely
you
could
have
the
man
locked
up
knowing
what
you
know
about
him
morse
sighed
with
a
sort
of
gentle
patience
a
few
more
facts
he
said
and
do
reflect
that
it
most
improbable
that
a
man
of
my
intelligence
and
resources
should
act
as
he
has
done
without
being
sure
of
what
he
was
doing
in
the
first
place
i
had
midwinter
watched
by
the
most
famous
detectives
in
america
watched
for
years
none
of
these
people
have
ever
been
able
quite
to
bowl
him
out
a
simile
from
your
english
game
of
cricket
but
three
of
the
most
trusted
and
acute
agents
have
lost
their
lives
during
these
investigations
and
lost
them
in
a
singularly
unpleasant
manner
he
sighed
again
this
time
wearily
and
i
saw
that
his
face
was
old
and
without
interest
or
hope
what
on
earth
is
the
use
he
went
on
of
telling
you
all
i
know
about
this
man
sir
his
voice
began
to
rise
and
a
light
came
into
the
dark
depths
of
his
eyes
sir
if
i
saw
his
corpse
before
me
now
i
believe
him
dead
or
his
power
for
evil
ended
until
i
had
hacked
his
head
from
his
shoulders
with
my
own
hand
you
can
not
i
say
you
simply
can
not
realize
or
understand
the
fiendish
ingenuity
persistence
and
icy
cruelty
of
this
being
for
i
will
not
insult
our
common
humanity
by
calling
it
a
man
if
juanita
ever
gets
into
his
hands
his
mouth
his
whole
face
was
working
i
thought
he
was
going
to
have
a
fit
and
truth
to
tell
something
icy
began
to
congeal
around
my
own
heart
calm
yourself
sir
i
said
as
authoritatively
as
i
could
juanita
is
doubly
safe
now
that
i
am
here
and
as
for
midwinter
he
never
approach
us
here
it
beyond
the
wit
of
mortal
man
and
meanwhile
i
see
that
he
apprehended
and
removed
from
all
power
of
doing
harm
i
am
only
a
young
man
morse
but
i
rather
a
power
in
the
land
you
see
i
have
an
important
newspaper
at
my
back
and
as
for
you
who
have
already
made
the
government
feed
out
of
your
hand
in
the
matter
of
these
towers
you
should
have
gone
to
the
home
secretary
in
the
first
instance
at
any
rate
we
go
together
and
believe
me
we
shall
be
listened
to
i
thank
you
my
dear
boy
he
replied
with
an
effort
but
there
is
such
a
thing
as
fate
and
fate
has
whispered
in
my
ear
i
am
not
naturally
a
superstitious
man
but
during
a
life
spent
in
strange
places
among
strange
people
i
have
learnt
to
be
very
wary
of
a
material
interpretation
of
life
but
this
i
will
say
whatever
i
feel
about
myself
however
my
precautions
might
fail
i
believe
that
my
dear
daughter
will
win
to
safety
in
the
end
that
the
power
of
evil
will
be
overcome
and
that
you
will
be
her
savior
i
could
have
sworn
as
he
shook
hands
and
bade
me
there
was
a
tear
in
the
great
man
eye
and
i
wondered
how
long
it
was
since
any
one
had
seen
that
in
this
master
of
millions
and
of
men
a
picturesque
young
chinaman
a
valet
in
flowing
oriental
robes
who
spoke
english
with
the
most
appalling
cockney
accent
you
ever
heard
in
your
life
conducted
me
to
a
charming
bedroom
provided
me
with
everything
necessary
and
in
five
minutes
i
fell
into
a
deep
dreamless
sleep
a
really
full
day
was
it
when
i
woke
up
the
next
morning
my
room
was
flooded
with
sunshine
from
a
dome
in
the
ceiling
seated
upon
my
bed
and
balancing
a
cup
of
tea
was
master
bill
rolston
his
hair
was
restored
to
its
natural
red
his
nose
normal
and
his
high
were
gone
on
each
side
of
his
chubby
face
his
transparent
ears
stood
out
at
right
angles
and
his
button
of
a
mouth
was
wreathed
in
a
genial
smile
good
old
came
for
me
about
two
this
morning
sir
thomas
and
told
me
all
that
had
happened
i
say
sir
a
man
to
have
on
the
staff
of
the
an
intellect
i
seemed
to
have
heard
that
phrase
before
why
we
have
him
dictating
to
cabinet
ministers
within
a
year
i
lay
idly
watching
this
brilliant
and
faithful
boy
journalist
once
i
reflected
journalist
forever
there
no
getting
it
out
of
the
blood
and
here
if
i
not
mistaken
when
many
of
us
have
faded
away
from
fleet
street
forever
will
be
the
biggest
of
us
all
i
was
surprised
to
find
that
bill
was
distinctly
on
the
side
of
gideon
morse
in
his
anticipation
of
evil
we
argued
it
out
while
i
was
dressing
and
i
insisted
that
the
city
was
impregnable
to
all
ordinary
appearance
to
all
ordinary
efforts
yes
but
i
shall
never
change
my
belief
that
there
nothing
that
human
wit
can
invent
that
human
wit
can
not
circumvent
after
breakfast
which
i
took
alone
the
servant
led
me
to
a
great
white
house
standing
among
conservatories
which
i
learned
was
almost
an
exact
reproduction
of
the
palacete
mendoza
the
residence
of
gideon
morse
at
rio
and
there
in
her
own
charming
fragrant
with
flowers
and
stamped
in
a
hundred
ways
with
her
personality
juanita
was
waiting
she
was
radiant
happiness
lay
about
her
like
sunbeams
i
never
saw
any
one
more
changed
than
she
was
from
the
girl
i
had
met
the
night
before
come
dearest
she
said
and
i
show
you
some
of
our
wonders
i
could
not
show
you
all
of
them
in
one
day
oh
tom
is
it
all
splendid
could
you
sing
and
shout
for
joy
i
helped
her
into
a
fur
coat
for
it
was
bitter
cold
outside
though
the
wind
of
the
night
before
had
dropped
and
was
provided
with
one
myself
as
we
left
the
house
standing
in
the
patio
was
a
little
automobile
a
tiny
toy
of
a
thing
run
from
electric
storage
batteries
which
made
no
noise
louder
than
the
humming
of
a
wasp
we
got
into
this
and
juanita
was
like
a
child
as
she
pulled
the
starting
lever
and
we
rolled
away
i
have
said
i
woke
to
find
my
bedroom
full
of
sunlight
but
as
we
glided
down
an
arcade
of
conservatories
upon
each
side
of
the
road
so
that
the
illusion
of
passing
among
a
palm
grove
was
almost
complete
i
noticed
that
dark
and
angry
clouds
were
gathering
not
far
above
our
heads
and
it
was
through
one
single
aperture
that
the
sunlight
poured
the
effect
of
this
when
we
ran
through
the
tunneled
archway
and
came
out
into
a
great
square
was
curious
a
third
of
the
buildings
which
towered
up
on
every
side
were
bathed
in
glory
the
rest
gray
sullen
and
throwing
shadows
of
sable
upon
the
lawns
gravel
sweeps
and
parquet
flooring
we
investigated
a
dozen
marvels
of
which
i
shall
not
speak
here
the
whole
experience
was
a
dream
of
luxury
so
wonderful
and
so
fantastic
also
that
my
readers
must
wait
for
william
rolston
book
now
nearing
completion
it
was
impossible
to
believe
that
we
were
actually
walking
motoring
more
than
two
thousand
feet
above
london
in
a
little
world
of
our
own
which
bore
no
relation
whatever
to
ordinary
human
life
this
was
especially
borne
in
upon
me
with
overwhelming
force
when
we
had
ascended
the
steps
of
a
tower
and
came
out
into
a
glass
chamber
on
the
roof
where
an
old
chinese
gentleman
with
spectacles
showed
us
the
great
telescope
which
morse
had
installed
following
the
shifting
path
of
sunlight
i
got
a
dim
glimpse
of
the
english
channel
over
a
champaign
of
fertile
woods
and
downs
studded
here
and
there
with
toy
towns
the
size
of
once
but
only
for
a
moment
i
made
out
the
great
towers
of
canterbury
cathedral
but
the
sun
shifted
and
the
vision
passed
london
itself
brought
immediately
to
our
feet
was
an
astonishing
sight
but
as
every
one
has
seen
the
photographs
taken
from
aeroplanes
i
will
not
dilate
upon
it
though
it
differed
in
many
ways
from
these
perhaps
the
most
pleasing
sight
of
all
was
that
of
richmond
park
where
the
winter
fair
had
just
begun
we
could
see
the
roundabouts
the
swings
and
so
forth
with
great
clearness
and
even
as
the
wind
freshened
catch
a
faint
buzzing
noise
from
the
steam
organs
then
a
captive
balloon
rose
up
i
suppose
a
thousand
feet
and
some
quarter
of
a
mile
away
with
powerful
field
glasses
we
could
see
the
big
basket
crammed
with
adventurous
trippers
till
she
was
hauled
down
again
to
make
another
ascent
and
add
a
few
more
pounds
to
the
profits
of
her
proprietors
i
was
quite
tired
when
we
went
back
to
the
house
to
lunch
during
the
meal
which
was
long
and
elaborate
morse
showed
a
side
of
his
nature
i
had
never
before
seen
he
was
not
jovial
or
in
high
spirits
distinctly
not
that
but
he
was
strangely
tender
and
human
i
realized
the
immense
love
he
had
for
juanita
and
wondered
how
he
could
ever
bear
to
see
her
love
me
but
he
was
kindness
itself
like
a
father
to
the
interloper
who
had
stormed
his
fortress
and
i
always
like
to
think
of
him
as
he
was
on
that
afternoon
full
of
anecdotes
about
his
youth
of
juanita
mother
of
the
old
days
in
brazil
it
was
my
formal
reception
into
his
life
henceforth
i
was
to
be
he
said
it
once
in
well
and
words
a
son
to
him
who
had
never
had
a
son
in
the
afternoon
i
went
back
to
my
own
quarters
which
consisted
of
a
villa
at
the
end
of
the
palace
gardens
where
i
was
lodged
with
rolston
and
attended
by
various
chinamen
i
had
rarely
seen
a
more
delightful
bachelor
dwelling
i
took
a
cup
of
tea
with
bill
about
four
it
was
now
quite
dark
and
the
bitter
wind
was
rising
again
but
heavy
curtains
of
tussore
silk
were
pulled
over
the
windows
a
fire
of
yew
logs
burned
in
the
open
hearth
and
softly
shaded
electric
lights
all
combined
to
produce
the
coziest
and
most
homelike
effect
it
is
possible
to
imagine
it
was
then
that
a
man
came
in
to
say
that
begged
the
honor
of
an
audience
bill
vanished
and
my
thin
ascetic
friend
glided
in
and
at
my
invitation
sank
into
a
chair
by
the
fire
i
do
think
in
the
whole
course
of
my
life
i
could
recall
a
conversation
which
touched
interested
and
excited
my
admiration
more
than
this
and
i
have
met
every
one
from
emperor
to
clown
he
apologized
profoundly
for
his
seeming
treachery
with
a
wealth
of
lucid
and
the
power
of
presenting
a
clear
statement
which
i
have
seldom
heard
equaled
he
showed
how
he
was
torn
between
his
debtorship
to
me
his
loyalty
to
morse
for
whom
he
professed
a
profound
esteem
and
here
he
hinted
with
extraordinary
his
mute
adoration
for
juanita
it
was
sir
thomas
touch
and
go
of
course
i
was
in
the
position
of
a
surgeon
who
has
to
risk
everything
upon
one
heroic
stroke
of
the
knife
i
did
so
and
behold
all
the
conflicting
elements
are
reconciled
the
pieces
of
the
puzzle
have
come
together
my
friend
i
said
betray
me
twenty
million
times
if
you
can
bring
me
such
happiness
as
you
have
brought
besides
it
was
a
betrayal
it
was
a
great
brain
leading
a
smaller
one
to
its
appointed
goal
we
talked
a
little
more
he
drank
tea
he
smoked
and
to
my
growing
discomfort
i
found
in
him
the
same
note
of
pessimism
and
apprehension
that
morse
could
not
conceal
and
rolston
himself
had
partially
revealed
but
i
believe
that
any
harm
can
come
to
miss
morse
i
said
almost
angrily
the
thin
lips
smiled
that
i
never
said
sir
thomas
there
are
no
indications
of
that
you
and
your
lady
are
in
peril
but
you
will
win
through
confound
it
man
your
liver
must
be
out
of
order
it
seems
to
me
that
captivity
in
this
magnificent
has
the
same
effect
on
every
one
i
shall
get
morse
to
come
and
hunt
with
me
in
the
shires
i
got
a
nice
little
box
in
gloucestershire
close
to
chipping
norton
and
by
jove
i
mount
you
and
give
you
a
run
with
the
heythrope
you
talk
as
if
you
actually
knew
something
as
if
you
had
information
of
a
calamity
i
hear
it
in
the
wind
he
said
strangely
and
his
voice
was
like
a
withered
leaf
blown
before
the
wind
then
he
left
me
i
dined
with
juanita
and
her
father
bill
was
asked
too
and
he
kept
my
girl
and
sometimes
even
morse
in
fits
of
laughter
with
stories
of
his
short
but
erratic
career
and
especially
a
racy
account
of
his
illicit
down
below
you
see
sir
he
said
you
brought
it
on
yourself
by
kidnaping
me
in
the
first
instance
i
had
to
get
my
own
back
morse
face
clouded
over
for
a
moment
it
was
a
disgraceful
thing
to
do
he
said
i
quite
admit
it
but
had
the
necessity
arisen
i
have
kidnaped
george
robey
or
the
prince
of
wales
and
from
that
moment
always
i
seemed
to
see
that
a
faint
but
perceptible
shadow
was
creeping
over
his
spirits
we
had
a
little
music
in
a
charming
room
built
for
the
purpose
juanita
played
upon
the
guitar
and
sang
little
spanish
love
songs
bill
obliged
with
a
ditty
which
he
said
was
a
favorite
of
the
revered
charles
lamb
which
seemed
to
consist
entirely
of
the
following
lines
my
son
john
went
to
bed
with
his
breeches
on
i
think
that
when
juanita
said
to
us
all
and
to
me
privately
in
the
passage
she
went
to
bed
quite
happy
and
cheerful
about
ten
bill
slipped
off
and
i
remained
to
smoke
a
final
cigar
with
morse
i
low
thomas
he
said
i
very
low
i
made
him
take
a
little
whisky
and
potash
a
thing
he
rarely
did
it
the
unnatural
life
sir
that
you
condemned
yourself
to
recently
you
come
out
of
this
and
hunt
with
me
in
gloucestershire
and
i
protect
you
as
well
as
you
protected
here
and
you
get
as
right
as
rain
you
very
kind
he
replied
but
take
care
of
her
kirby
for
sake
take
care
of
her
she
have
no
one
else
in
the
world
but
you
if
they
get
me
or
i
was
about
to
expostulate
again
when
the
door
opened
and
boss
mulligan
slouched
in
been
all
round
the
city
governor
with
the
usual
patrol
everything
quiet
nothing
unusual
anywhere
all
the
servants
have
given
in
their
tallies
and
are
safe
in
their
quarters
morse
looked
at
me
that
our
system
tom
he
said
at
a
certain
hour
all
the
servants
go
to
the
lower
stage
except
those
that
may
be
urgently
wanted
for
instance
there
a
fellow
in
your
house
to
valet
you
juanita
has
her
little
spanish
maid
and
i
think
keeps
some
one
otherwise
we
are
all
to
ourselves
up
here
all
the
lift
doors
are
locked
on
the
second
stage
and
so
is
the
central
staircase
mulligan
here
is
on
guard
all
night
in
the
room
where
you
saw
him
an
watchin
ye
from
the
ind
of
me
eye
sorr
thomas
said
the
genial
ruffian
av
ye
belave
ut
you
a
good
actor
mulligan
i
said
it
seemed
about
the
only
thing
i
could
say
sure
an
i
am
that
he
said
i
am
that
sorr
but
i
a
bether
doer
an
av
ye
reely
bin
staling
in
his
immense
fist
clenched
itself
and
he
shook
it
in
my
direction
mulligan
go
back
to
the
said
morse
you
drunk
the
giant
face
changed
from
ferocity
into
pained
surprise
but
av
course
sorr
he
said
it
me
usual
time
as
your
honor
must
know
but
begob
i
efficient
the
mingled
grin
and
glare
on
his
countenance
when
mulligan
went
away
left
no
doubt
in
my
mind
about
that
a
few
minutes
afterwards
certainly
not
drunk
and
i
hope
efficient
i
left
the
palacete
mendoza
and
walked
through
the
gardens
to
the
villa
morse
himself
barred
the
door
after
me
it
was
bitter
aching
cold
and
the
wind
was
gaunt
wreaths
of
mist
were
all
around
like
a
legion
of
ghosts
and
i
realized
that
the
clouds
were
descending
upon
us
and
soon
i
should
not
be
able
to
see
a
yard
before
me
though
the
electric
lamps
that
never
went
out
all
night
over
the
whole
city
glowed
with
a
dim
blueness
here
and
there
through
the
fog
however
i
found
the
villa
all
right
and
my
chinese
boy
waiting
in
the
hall
he
took
my
coat
saw
that
the
fires
in
the
and
the
adjoining
bedroom
were
made
up
and
then
i
told
him
he
might
be
off
to
his
quarters
on
the
second
stage
for
which
he
seemed
extremely
thankful
i
do
suppose
he
had
been
gone
more
than
a
minute
when
the
door
of
my
opened
and
rolston
came
in
quickly
he
was
wearing
a
and
pyjamas
and
his
hair
was
all
rough
like
one
recently
aroused
from
sleep
what
on
earth
the
matter
i
said
i
undressed
he
said
in
my
bedroom
which
is
just
above
yours
as
you
know
and
fell
asleep
in
my
chair
with
all
the
lights
on
i
woke
only
a
short
time
ago
and
before
switching
off
the
lamps
i
went
to
the
window
to
see
what
sort
of
a
night
it
was
hellish
if
you
want
to
know
the
light
streamed
out
upon
a
great
curtain
of
mist
almost
like
the
projector
lamp
upon
a
screen
of
a
kinema
sir
thomas
as
i
stood
there
i
could
swear
that
something
big
black
and
oblong
sank
down
from
that
darkness
above
passed
through
my
zone
of
light
and
disappeared
in
the
blackness
below
what
on
earth
do
you
mean
what
sort
of
a
thing
he
hesitated
for
a
moment
and
then
he
said
almost
like
a
group
of
statuary
though
i
only
saw
it
for
a
mere
instant
he
had
obviously
been
half
dreaming
when
he
went
to
the
window
his
eyes
even
now
were
heavy
with
sleep
simply
and
solely
a
trick
of
the
wind
upon
the
mist
and
your
own
figure
interposing
between
the
light
and
the
window
and
throwing
a
momentary
shade
on
the
swaying
white
curtain
outside
the
mist
as
thick
as
linen
and
it
changes
every
moment
you
go
to
bed
properly
and
sleep
the
sleep
of
the
just
he
did
attempt
to
argue
but
looked
a
little
ashamed
of
himself
for
obtruding
for
such
a
trivial
reason
ten
minutes
afterwards
i
was
also
in
bed
and
fast
asleep
chapter
twelve
i
had
ordered
my
chinese
boy
to
wake
me
at
eight
in
one
corner
of
the
grand
square
was
a
beautifully
fitted
gymnasium
with
a
adjoining
i
proposed
of
an
hour
vigorous
exercise
before
dressing
at
it
happens
i
generally
wake
more
or
less
at
the
time
i
want
to
this
morning
however
it
was
eight
there
was
no
sound
of
chang
whatever
i
got
out
of
bed
put
on
a
sweater
norfolk
jacket
flannel
trousers
and
tennis
shoes
i
had
sent
for
a
portmanteau
of
clothes
from
the
golden
swan
went
across
the
hall
and
let
myself
out
into
the
gardens
then
i
hesitated
in
amazement
a
thick
heavy
impenetrable
mist
hid
everything
from
sight
it
seemed
as
solid
as
wool
one
literally
had
to
push
one
way
through
it
and
when
i
say
that
i
could
see
more
than
a
yard
before
my
face
i
mean
it
in
the
strict
sense
of
the
words
still
i
remembered
that
i
have
a
good
sense
of
topography
and
i
was
quite
confident
that
i
could
find
my
way
to
the
central
square
where
there
would
be
sure
to
be
people
about
whom
i
could
ask
from
my
front
door
there
was
a
good
hundred
and
twenty
yards
of
wide
gravel
path
to
the
palacete
mendoza
i
sprinted
up
this
in
less
than
twenty
seconds
i
should
say
and
then
warily
turned
into
the
grove
the
great
sheets
of
plated
glass
on
either
side
of
the
way
were
in
place
now
but
i
knew
where
i
was
because
of
the
different
quality
of
the
ground
which
was
here
paved
with
wood
blocks
soon
a
faint
gray
mass
to
my
right
the
palace
itself
loomed
up
but
the
blanket
of
mist
was
too
thick
for
me
to
discern
windows
or
doors
one
could
see
nothing
but
the
gray
hint
of
mass
the
curious
thing
was
that
one
could
hear
nothing
either
that
had
not
struck
me
as
i
did
my
sprint
but
now
it
did
and
most
forcibly
of
course
there
was
no
sound
of
wind
had
there
been
any
wind
we
should
not
have
been
buried
in
the
very
heart
of
this
fog
thicker
and
more
sticky
than
anything
i
had
ever
experienced
in
the
alps
themselves
but
there
were
no
sounds
of
occupation
such
as
an
extensive
place
like
the
city
might
have
been
expected
to
produce
at
this
hour
and
in
fact
as
i
realized
produce
when
i
remembered
yesterday
the
place
was
never
noisy
it
was
a
haunt
of
peace
if
ever
there
was
one
but
the
sound
of
gardeners
and
servants
going
about
their
daily
toil
the
distant
throbbing
of
an
engine
perhaps
a
subdued
voice
giving
an
order
the
plashing
of
fountains
and
the
strains
of
music
all
these
were
utterly
and
entirely
absent
it
was
as
though
the
mist
killed
not
only
vision
but
hearing
also
i
might
have
been
on
the
top
of
mont
blanc
what
little
town
by
harbor
or
is
empty
of
its
folk
this
pious
morn
i
quoted
to
myself
with
a
laugh
just
as
i
entered
the
arched
tunnel
wide
enough
for
two
coaches
to
be
driven
under
it
abreast
which
i
knew
led
to
grand
square
i
laughed
and
then
quite
suddenly
all
laughter
went
out
of
me
i
could
explain
it
at
the
moment
but
the
mist
the
loneliness
my
whole
surroundings
seemed
quite
horrible
surely
something
had
passed
me
i
called
out
and
my
voice
seemed
like
the
bleating
of
a
sheep
of
course
it
was
illusion
my
nerves
had
suddenly
gone
wrong
but
honestly
i
felt
that
there
was
something
in
the
atmosphere
nasty
from
a
psychic
point
of
view
i
mean
there
are
moments
when
the
human
soul
turns
sick
and
retches
with
disgust
and
i
experienced
such
a
moment
now
i
think
it
was
exactly
then
that
i
knew
though
i
would
allow
myself
to
believe
it
that
i
knew
inwardly
all
was
not
well
i
walked
on
and
my
shoes
seemed
to
make
a
sly
unpleasant
noise
it
was
the
only
one
i
heard
even
now
i
could
see
nothing
i
was
quite
uncertain
of
where
i
was
so
i
turned
and
walked
straight
to
the
right
until
from
the
impact
of
the
air
upon
my
face
i
knew
that
i
was
within
a
yard
or
so
of
some
building
this
was
correct
my
hand
touched
what
seemed
like
stonework
and
glancing
up
i
became
aware
that
a
building
rose
high
above
i
followed
this
along
keeping
my
hand
on
the
stone
moving
it
round
projecting
buttresses
and
going
with
great
caution
this
progression
seemed
to
be
endless
i
took
out
my
watch
which
i
had
shoved
into
the
breast
pocket
of
my
norfolk
jacket
it
was
nearly
nine
and
not
a
single
sound
a
second
or
two
afterwards
i
came
to
a
balustrade
felt
my
way
along
it
and
found
that
i
was
at
the
foot
of
a
broad
flight
of
steps
there
seemed
something
vaguely
familiar
here
and
as
i
ran
up
them
i
began
to
be
sure
that
i
was
at
the
library
i
knew
that
lived
somewhere
on
the
premises
and
i
felt
all
over
the
great
door
until
i
came
to
the
small
postern
wicket
through
which
one
generally
entered
this
was
locked
but
a
of
wrought
iron
hung
at
the
side
and
i
pulled
at
it
lustily
for
a
considerable
time
it
opened
with
a
jerk
and
stood
there
in
his
skull
cap
with
the
coral
button
on
the
top
and
wrapped
in
a
robe
thank
goodness
i
found
some
one
i
said
i
lost
my
way
i
was
going
to
the
gymnasium
to
exercise
a
little
and
then
have
a
swim
my
boy
did
turn
up
so
i
came
out
by
myself
come
in
come
in
sir
thomas
he
said
peering
out
at
the
white
curtain
what
a
dreadful
morning
i
been
here
some
months
now
but
i
have
never
seen
it
so
bad
as
this
i
daresay
it
will
blow
off
by
nine
or
so
when
the
sun
gets
up
it
nine
now
i
told
him
he
started
violently
then
my
servant
also
is
at
fault
he
said
i
ordered
my
coffee
for
eight
i
was
reading
far
into
the
night
and
must
have
overslept
myself
this
is
very
curious
do
you
know
i
do
quite
like
it
i
come
all
the
way
from
the
pavilion
in
the
palace
gardens
and
have
heard
the
least
sound
of
any
sort
whatever
we
passed
through
a
lobby
and
entered
the
great
library
which
was
cold
and
gray
as
a
tomb
snapped
at
a
switch
then
at
another
nothing
happened
the
electric
light
is
off
he
cried
what
an
extraordinary
thing
mine
was
i
said
i
got
out
of
bed
and
dressed
by
it
he
did
not
reply
but
took
down
the
speaking
part
of
a
telephone
and
turned
the
handle
of
the
box
in
that
gray
light
his
thin
face
with
its
expression
of
strained
attention
was
one
i
shall
not
easily
forget
he
turned
the
handle
again
angrily
again
an
interval
of
silence
the
telephone
is
out
of
order
he
said
and
we
looked
at
each
other
with
a
question
in
our
eyes
well
i
confoundedly
glad
i
found
you
i
said
we
must
look
into
this
at
once
sir
thomas
i
can
find
my
way
perfectly
well
to
one
of
the
lifts
at
the
other
end
of
the
square
we
must
summon
assistance
one
moment
he
vanished
for
a
minute
and
returned
with
something
cool
and
shining
which
he
pressed
into
my
hand
it
was
a
venomous
colt
automatic
you
never
know
he
whispered
we
hurried
across
the
great
square
passing
by
the
central
fountain
basins
though
the
fountains
were
not
playing
which
added
to
our
uneasiness
everything
was
deathly
still
until
we
came
to
the
little
lift
pavilion
i
half
expected
the
thing
to
stick
but
it
glided
down
easily
enough
as
if
my
companion
read
my
thoughts
he
said
all
these
small
lifts
are
not
electrical
but
are
worked
by
hydraulic
power
the
station
for
which
is
in
the
city
and
not
below
on
the
earth
i
shall
never
forget
the
extraordinary
sight
as
we
stepped
from
the
lift
the
mist
here
was
nothing
like
so
thick
as
it
was
above
this
was
owing
to
the
fact
that
a
hundred
feet
above
our
heads
there
was
the
immense
ceiling
of
steel
plates
and
girders
upon
which
the
city
rested
as
i
said
before
on
all
three
sides
this
second
service
city
was
open
to
the
air
but
not
above
consequently
the
mist
moved
in
tall
white
shapes
like
ghosts
it
entirely
surrounded
one
group
of
huts
and
left
another
great
vista
of
buildings
plain
to
the
eye
here
a
gaudily
painted
gable
thrust
itself
out
of
the
white
sheet
there
through
a
proscenium
of
clinging
wool
one
saw
the
gray
interior
of
a
a
chill
twilight
brooded
everywhere
there
was
a
single
lamp
burning
and
from
one
end
to
the
other
lay
the
desolation
of
utter
silence
i
leant
against
the
jamb
of
the
lift
door
and
despite
the
cold
the
sweat
ran
down
my
body
in
a
stream
raised
a
thin
arm
over
his
head
and
it
seemed
to
clutch
crookedly
at
the
somber
panoply
aloft
a
high
thin
wail
came
from
his
parted
lips
and
went
mournfully
away
down
the
deserted
streets
and
empty
habitations
for
myself
i
had
been
so
stunned
that
i
could
think
but
my
friend
despairing
call
seemed
to
jerk
some
within
the
brain
and
start
again
the
mechanism
of
thought
i
gripped
him
by
the
shoulder
there
is
a
soul
here
i
rasped
out
what
does
it
mean
what
on
earth
does
it
mean
there
should
be
three
hundred
at
least
he
answered
i
broke
away
at
a
run
flung
open
the
first
door
i
came
to
and
peered
in
it
was
some
sort
of
a
there
were
bunks
and
couches
all
around
the
walls
each
one
of
them
was
empty
i
had
time
to
see
that
and
also
that
a
stand
of
short
carbines
and
cutlasses
was
full
of
weapons
then
i
had
to
back
out
quickly
for
the
late
inmates
had
left
an
odorous
legacy
behind
them
faced
me
that
was
one
of
the
patrol
rooms
he
said
then
i
remembered
our
coming
two
days
ago
mulligan
i
cried
nobody
could
get
here
except
through
the
nobody
could
leave
here
except
through
that
could
they
not
unless
they
threw
themselves
from
the
side
of
the
tower
well
it
quite
impossible
to
believe
that
three
hundred
people
have
committed
suicide
during
the
night
without
a
sound
being
heard
quick
let
get
to
the
bottom
of
this
led
he
did
seem
really
to
run
only
to
glide
along
the
ghostly
streets
and
passages
but
i
had
hard
work
to
keep
up
with
him
all
the
same
my
mouth
felt
as
if
it
had
been
sucking
a
brass
tap
the
most
deadly
fear
clutched
at
my
heart
that
noiseless
pattering
run
through
the
deserted
town
in
the
air
accompanied
always
by
the
mouthing
gibbering
ghosts
of
the
mist
was
appalling
we
dashed
down
the
last
corridor
and
were
brought
up
by
a
stout
door
bent
down
to
the
handle
turned
it
gently
and
it
opened
we
tiptoed
into
that
room
directly
i
was
over
the
threshold
the
spiritual
odor
of
death
of
violent
death
came
to
me
a
fire
of
logs
was
still
burning
redly
upon
the
hearth
for
the
rest
the
room
was
lit
only
by
its
skylight
through
which
filtered
a
dirty
and
opaque
illumination
which
was
only
sufficient
to
give
every
object
a
shape
of
the
sinister
or
bizarre
the
red
glow
from
the
fire
glistened
upon
the
polished
screen
of
steel
which
divided
the
room
into
two
portions
and
it
also
fell
redly
upon
something
else
this
was
the
corpse
of
mulligan
it
was
seated
in
a
chair
which
had
been
pulled
up
to
the
screen
with
its
back
towards
it
as
if
in
mockery
and
derision
of
its
power
to
keep
it
he
had
been
strangled
by
a
yard
of
catgut
twisted
by
a
piece
of
stick
at
the
back
of
the
neck
the
catgut
had
sunk
far
into
the
flesh
reducing
the
neck
to
less
than
half
its
ordinary
size
and
the
great
staring
head
hung
down
upon
one
shoulder
one
of
the
logs
in
the
grate
fell
with
a
crackle
of
sparks
for
the
rest
dead
silence
they
have
come
said
simply
but
what
has
happened
i
whispered
my
throat
was
so
dry
that
the
sound
was
like
the
rustling
of
paper
i
shall
know
soon
i
am
going
to
find
out
there
is
not
a
minute
to
lose
can
you
dare
you
wait
here
i
nodded
and
he
was
out
of
the
room
in
a
flash
upon
the
dead
table
was
the
usual
array
of
bottles
and
glasses
i
took
some
brandy
and
gulped
it
down
and
my
brain
cleared
instantly
there
was
a
little
touch
of
infinite
pathos
even
in
this
hideous
moment
for
by
the
side
of
an
empty
glass
i
saw
a
string
of
beads
with
a
little
metal
crucifix
the
irishman
a
roman
catholic
of
course
must
have
been
saying
his
prayers
some
time
before
he
met
his
end
somehow
the
thought
comforted
me
and
gave
me
power
to
act
i
found
a
knife
and
cut
the
bonds
that
tied
the
giant
to
the
chair
i
lowered
him
reverently
to
the
floor
and
finally
severed
the
horrible
ligature
around
his
throat
an
examination
of
the
steel
door
in
the
screen
of
bars
showed
that
it
was
securely
locked
but
the
bunch
of
keys
which
the
dead
man
usually
carried
upon
a
chain
was
no
longer
there
the
end
of
the
chain
dangled
from
his
trousers
pocket
while
i
was
doing
these
things
a
most
deadly
apprehension
was
standing
by
my
side
and
plucking
with
wan
fingers
at
my
sleeve
what
had
happened
what
might
even
now
be
happening
at
the
palacete
mendoza
whirled
into
the
room
he
made
no
noise
it
was
as
though
a
dried
leaf
had
been
blown
in
by
the
wind
his
face
was
transformed
every
outline
was
sharpened
and
the
color
was
changed
until
it
bore
the
exact
resemblance
to
a
mask
of
green
bronze
in
its
frozen
immobility
it
was
dead
yet
awfully
alive
and
the
eyes
glittered
like
little
crumbs
of
diamond
well
i
know
how
it
has
been
done
it
is
very
clever
very
clever
indeed
let
me
tell
you
that
all
the
power
cables
connecting
us
with
below
have
been
scientifically
cut
we
can
neither
telephone
down
to
the
park
nor
can
we
descend
to
it
in
one
of
the
lifts
we
are
isolated
up
here
in
the
clouds
but
the
men
the
staff
i
gasped
and
then
i
stepped
back
staring
down
at
his
hands
they
were
all
foul
and
stained
with
blood
not
far
away
he
said
there
is
another
body
that
of
my
servant
a
youth
from
my
own
province
whom
i
loved
and
whom
i
was
educating
he
was
alive
five
minutes
ago
he
had
just
time
to
sob
out
the
truth
and
his
repentance
tell
me
quickly
time
presses
they
caught
him
last
night
so
they
must
have
been
here
then
who
caught
him
he
never
knew
they
were
masked
but
there
were
two
of
them
and
from
his
description
we
know
very
well
who
they
were
sir
thomas
they
tortured
him
for
a
long
time
until
he
spoke
promising
him
freedom
if
he
did
so
his
story
was
disjointed
gasped
out
with
his
dying
breath
but
i
can
put
it
together
pretty
well
they
made
him
give
an
order
by
telephone
from
the
upper
city
that
immediately
the
staff
were
to
leave
here
and
descend
to
the
ground
and
await
further
orders
all
but
mulligan
who
was
to
remain
at
his
post
until
i
came
to
him
this
message
was
delivered
in
chinese
to
the
man
at
the
telephone
exchange
and
the
poor
boy
was
forced
to
counterfeit
my
voice
he
was
blindfolded
immediately
afterwards
but
he
heard
a
man
speaking
and
he
said
he
could
not
have
told
the
voice
from
that
of
mr
morse
in
a
flash
i
saw
the
whole
thing
in
its
devilish
ingenuity
its
fiendish
completeness
then
we
are
absolutely
alone
you
i
rolston
morse
and
his
daughter
and
her
maid
he
answered
quietly
at
the
mercy
of
that
we
have
yet
to
prove
we
must
throw
all
emotion
all
fear
aside
that
what
we
have
to
do
now
it
diamond
cut
diamond
there
one
problem
in
my
mind
and
one
only
what
that
quick
i
daresay
that
in
an
hour
i
could
get
down
to
the
ground
among
the
intricate
of
this
tower
there
a
tiny
circular
staircase
of
open
sufficient
for
the
passage
of
one
person
only
and
even
here
every
three
or
four
hundred
feet
the
way
is
barred
by
locked
gates
though
i
have
a
master
key
to
all
of
them
shall
i
make
the
attempt
and
risk
crashing
off
into
space
for
it
is
a
mere
steeplejack
way
and
summon
assistance
which
may
well
be
another
hour
in
arriving
for
the
tower
cables
have
been
scientifically
cut
and
no
one
but
an
electrician
could
repair
them
or
shall
i
rush
with
you
to
defend
the
palace
you
leave
the
decision
to
me
it
is
in
your
hands
prince
then
old
chap
tumble
down
this
accursed
tower
hell
for
leather
and
rouse
the
pack
if
i
and
morse
and
bill
rolston
can
not
account
for
these
cowardly
assassins
then
one
more
man
wo
make
any
difference
so
i
said
so
i
thought
i
had
no
idea
into
what
peril
i
was
sending
him
though
i
have
sometimes
wondered
if
he
knew
he
took
my
hand
kissed
it
and
beckoning
me
we
hurried
through
the
silent
under
city
towards
the
lift
you
go
up
sir
thomas
he
said
and
exercise
the
utmost
care
have
your
pistol
ready
the
mist
is
as
thick
as
ever
which
is
in
your
favor
you
can
find
your
way
now
to
the
palace
i
am
sure
and
you
i
go
off
here
he
said
pointing
with
his
left
arm
down
a
long
vista
to
where
under
a
square
arch
there
was
nothing
to
be
seen
at
all
but
swaying
one
opens
the
gate
in
the
railing
and
drops
on
to
the
circular
stairs
he
said
which
cling
to
the
outside
of
the
all
the
way
down
like
a
little
train
of
ivy
be
as
quick
as
you
can
and
i
jumped
into
the
elevator
some
two
minutes
afterwards
when
i
was
creeping
through
the
wool
with
my
pistol
in
my
hand
alert
for
the
slightest
sound
around
me
i
heard
the
sharp
crack
of
a
rifle
it
came
from
behind
me
there
was
a
perceptible
interval
and
then
another
crack
followed
i
could
have
sworn
to
it
by
a
thin
wailing
cry
then
utter
silence
fell
once
more
upon
the
white
and
muffled
city
as
i
ran
i
tried
to
steel
myself
if
that
were
as
i
suspected
the
last
dying
cry
of
not
to
think
about
it
the
immediate
moment
the
immediate
future
these
were
everything
all
the
extraordinary
precautions
had
failed
the
assassins
were
here
in
what
force
how
had
they
come
though
that
was
useless
to
speculate
on
two
things
only
remained
i
must
warn
morse
if
it
was
not
already
too
late
must
avenge
him
if
it
was
i
resolutely
put
aside
the
thought
of
juanita
of
any
personal
feeling
which
might
mar
my
judgment
and
unstring
my
nerves
at
this
supreme
and
dreadful
moment
i
found
myself
somehow
or
other
at
the
entrance
to
the
tunneled
passage
save
for
my
own
quick
breathing
there
had
not
been
a
sound
and
the
horrible
curtain
of
the
fog
was
as
thick
as
ever
should
i
at
once
creep
up
to
the
palace
or
should
i
go
back
to
the
villa
and
find
rolston
it
was
a
nice
question
and
the
decision
had
to
be
instantaneous
i
decided
that
it
would
give
me
a
tremendous
advantage
to
have
him
with
me
and
besides
that
he
himself
must
be
warned
of
the
terror
that
lurked
in
the
darkness
of
the
cloud
i
arrived
without
any
mishap
pushed
open
the
door
and
was
crossing
the
dark
hall
when
my
foot
caught
in
some
obstruction
and
i
fell
headlong
there
was
no
time
to
cry
out
had
i
been
startled
enough
to
do
so
before
something
leapt
upon
my
back
with
a
soft
yet
heavy
thud
a
hand
slipped
over
my
mouth
and
the
round
barrel
of
a
pistol
was
pressed
into
my
neck
i
lay
helpless
thinking
that
it
was
all
over
when
the
weight
lifted
the
pistol
was
snatched
away
and
i
was
hauled
to
my
feet
to
discover
rolston
not
a
word
he
whispered
i
set
a
trap
in
the
hall
sir
thomas
thank
god
you
are
alive
thank
god
you
are
too
bill
they
strangled
mulligan
killed
another
chinese
by
torture
and
i
am
very
much
afraid
have
shot
as
he
was
trying
to
get
down
to
earth
to
summon
help
every
single
member
of
the
staff
is
down
in
the
park
with
orders
to
stay
there
false
orders
the
lifts
are
all
put
out
of
action
beyond
possibility
of
being
repaired
for
several
hours
that
how
things
stand
now
we
must
get
to
the
palace
as
quickly
as
we
possibly
can
god
knows
what
has
happened
or
may
be
happening
there
this
way
quick
he
said
when
he
had
listened
to
me
with
strained
attention
he
took
my
arm
hurried
me
into
the
back
part
of
the
house
opened
a
door
with
a
key
and
we
entered
a
bedroom
which
i
had
not
before
seen
the
windows
were
shuttered
and
curtained
but
the
electric
light
which
never
failed
either
my
villa
or
the
palace
during
the
whole
of
those
terrible
hours
made
every
detail
clear
upon
the
bed
lying
as
if
asleep
was
juanita
leaning
over
her
was
a
tall
elderly
french
woman
with
a
typical
norman
face
i
staggered
back
into
bill
rolston
arms
good
god
i
cried
and
then
she
not
dead
tell
me
she
not
dead
marie
the
french
maid
turned
she
perfectly
well
only
she
had
a
fainting
fit
and
given
her
something
to
keep
her
quiet
she
spoke
in
french
then
how
do
you
come
here
what
happened
at
some
time
in
the
night
i
think
it
must
have
been
between
two
and
three
the
warning
bell
which
is
always
attached
to
my
bed
began
to
ring
i
knew
exactly
what
to
do
it
was
part
of
precautions
in
which
he
had
drilled
us
when
that
bell
rang
at
whatever
time
of
day
or
night
i
was
to
wake
instantly
dress
her
without
a
second
delay
and
bring
her
out
of
the
palace
by
a
secret
way
i
did
so
and
arrived
in
this
room
where
fainted
the
door
was
locked
from
the
outside
and
as
i
have
strict
orders
never
to
exceed
my
instructions
by
a
hair
breadth
i
have
been
waiting
not
very
long
ago
here
she
pointed
to
rolston
hearing
some
noise
unlocked
the
door
and
came
in
to
him
i
told
what
had
happened
thank
god
i
said
aloud
that
she
safe
and
in
my
heart
i
paid
a
tribute
to
the
minutely
detailed
genius
of
gideon
morse
who
had
at
least
foiled
the
panthers
on
his
track
in
one
and
the
greatest
particular
very
well
then
now
we
must
leave
you
here
while
we
hurry
to
the
palace
to
try
and
learn
what
has
happened
and
do
what
we
can
you
will
not
be
afraid
no
she
replied
simply
there
an
angel
with
us
and
she
crossed
herself
devoutly
and
moreover
from
somewhere
about
her
waist
she
withdrew
a
long
keen
knife
i
know
what
to
do
with
this
in
the
last
resort
i
went
to
the
bed
i
looked
down
at
juanita
and
kissed
her
gently
on
the
forehead
now
then
bill
come
along
i
said
bill
grinned
by
the
private
way
he
said
pointing
to
the
french
woman
who
was
removing
a
heavy
turkish
rug
which
lay
in
front
of
the
fireplace
there
was
a
click
and
a
portion
of
the
floor
fell
down
disclosing
some
steps
padded
with
felt
this
way
she
whispered
the
passage
is
lit
but
here
a
torch
if
you
should
need
it
and
here
is
the
book
she
handed
me
a
little
book
about
the
size
of
a
railway
ticket
what
this
instructions
in
english
and
chinese
in
regard
to
the
secret
room
at
the
other
end
they
are
few
and
simple
but
morse
had
them
printed
so
that
there
could
be
no
mistake
if
ever
it
became
necessary
to
use
the
place
and
its
machinery
he
thinks
of
everything
said
bill
as
we
crept
down
into
a
fairly
wide
passage
and
the
above
rose
once
more
into
its
place
the
passage
was
fully
a
hundred
and
thirty
or
forty
yards
long
and
straight
as
an
arrow
as
we
approached
the
end
which
i
saw
to
be
hidden
by
a
heavy
curtain
i
thought
of
the
little
leather
covered
book
motioning
rolston
to
stop
i
opened
it
and
read
the
english
portion
there
were
about
five
or
six
pages
with
one
or
two
simple
diagrams
and
i
blessed
the
journalistic
training
that
enabled
me
to
see
the
purport
of
the
whole
thing
in
a
minute
though
i
gasped
once
more
at
the
fertile
ingenuity
of
gideon
morse
gently
putting
aside
the
heavy
curtain
we
entered
a
room
of
some
size
the
floor
was
heavily
carpeted
around
two
of
the
walls
were
couches
piled
with
blankets
upon
shelves
above
were
piles
of
stores
i
saw
boxes
of
biscuits
tins
of
condensed
milk
and
many
bottles
of
wine
the
place
was
quite
fourteen
feet
high
and
at
one
end
four
posts
came
down
from
the
ceiling
to
the
floor
they
were
grooved
and
the
grooves
were
lined
with
steel
which
was
cogged
to
receive
a
toothed
wheel
between
the
four
posts
dropping
some
two
feet
from
the
ceiling
was
what
looked
like
the
lower
part
of
a
large
cistern
or
tank
this
apparatus
extended
along
the
whole
far
end
of
the
room
which
was
not
square
but
in
shape
immediately
opposite
to
where
we
entered
was
an
arrangement
of
levers
like
the
levers
in
a
railway
though
smaller
above
these
sprouting
out
of
the
wall
were
half
a
dozen
vulcanite
mouthpieces
like
black
trumpets
above
each
one
was
a
little
ivory
label
what
does
it
all
mean
bill
whispered
i
held
up
my
hand
for
silence
looking
round
the
place
referring
once
or
twice
to
the
little
book
and
making
absolutely
sure
as
i
was
doing
so
there
was
a
sudden
pop
followed
by
the
unmistakable
gurgle
of
champagne
into
a
glass
it
was
the
most
uncanny
thing
i
have
ever
heard
for
it
might
have
happened
at
my
elbow
had
it
not
been
that
a
tiny
electric
no
bigger
than
a
sixpence
glowed
out
over
one
of
the
mouthpieces
i
should
have
been
utterly
unnerved
this
mouthpiece
was
labeled
morse
study
the
dictograph
i
whispered
to
rolston
and
he
pressed
my
arm
to
show
he
understood
i
think
i
would
have
given
a
thousand
pounds
myself
for
some
champagne
just
then
we
stood
holding
each
other
frozen
into
an
ecstasy
of
listening
i
almost
thought
that
one
of
bill
remarkable
ears
was
elongating
itself
until
it
coiled
sinuously
towards
the
wall
but
this
no
doubt
was
illusion
there
came
a
voice
an
urbane
and
cultured
voice
well
modulated
and
serene
it
was
all
that
but
as
i
heard
it
my
blood
seemed
to
turn
to
red
currant
jelly
and
to
circulate
no
more
in
my
veins
if
there
was
ever
a
voice
which
was
informed
by
some
unnamable
quality
which
came
straight
from
the
red
pit
of
hell
we
heard
that
voice
then
hearing
it
i
knew
for
the
first
time
the
meaning
of
those
words
worm
that
dies
not
and
the
fire
that
is
not
whoever
thought
gideon
morse
that
i
should
be
breakfasting
with
you
to
tell
the
truth
i
did
myself
but
as
you
know
i
have
always
been
a
great
gambler
and
now
at
the
end
of
all
the
games
of
chance
that
we
have
played
together
i
have
turned
up
the
final
ace
another
voice
heaven
it
was
morse
himself
who
answered
his
voice
seemed
almost
amused
it
was
like
coming
out
of
a
pitch
dark
room
into
summer
sunlight
to
hear
it
after
that
other
mark
antony
midwinter
you
speak
of
triumph
but
you
were
never
nearer
your
ultimate
end
than
you
are
at
this
moment
i
could
have
sworn
i
heard
his
dry
chuckle
and
i
moved
nearer
to
the
wall
this
cold
pheasant
is
quite
excellent
what
is
the
use
of
trying
to
bluff
me
your
end
has
come
and
you
know
it
it
is
going
to
be
a
pleasant
end
i
expect
you
guess
that
we
have
tossed
the
dice
for
many
years
you
and
i
you
won
over
and
over
again
i
had
become
an
outcast
on
the
face
of
the
earth
until
fate
made
me
the
agent
of
a
great
vengeance
this
time
morse
laughed
outright
you
jackal
he
said
finish
your
stolen
meal
and
get
to
work
you
the
agent
of
a
great
vengeance
when
not
long
ago
you
slunk
into
my
london
hotel
and
offered
to
sell
your
employers
i
understand
he
went
on
in
a
curiously
impersonal
voice
that
you
really
are
supposed
to
be
descended
from
a
high
english
family
even
when
i
had
you
tarred
and
feathered
do
you
remember
that
antony
many
years
ago
i
still
believed
in
your
descent
though
i
own
i
did
give
it
much
of
a
thought
tell
me
where
exactly
did
the
come
in
following
upon
morse
words
we
heard
the
sound
of
footsteps
and
the
scraping
of
a
chair
a
new
person
had
come
into
the
room
and
midwinter
had
risen
to
meet
him
well
the
reply
came
in
a
deep
bass
voice
nothing
is
changed
there
was
one
chinaman
it
must
have
been
the
librarian
of
whom
that
guy
we
put
through
it
spoke
he
came
sliding
along
and
tried
to
get
down
by
the
cat
cradle
outside
the
tower
i
was
leaning
out
of
that
balcony
window
above
commanding
every
approach
and
i
got
him
with
my
second
shot
did
he
fall
all
the
way
down
that
might
startle
them
below
no
he
just
crumpled
up
on
the
stairs
and
after
looking
round
come
back
here
there
a
little
wind
beginning
to
get
up
and
i
should
wonder
if
in
an
hour
or
so
this
is
all
blown
away
half
an
hour
is
enough
for
what
we
have
to
do
zorilla
just
go
over
to
morse
there
and
see
if
his
lashings
are
secure
and
then
we
must
think
about
getting
off
ourselves
it
was
as
though
bill
and
i
could
see
exactly
what
was
happening
in
the
library
the
heavy
tread
an
affirmative
grunt
and
then
the
smooth
hellish
voice
resuming
you
know
you
got
to
die
morse
and
die
painfully
nothing
can
alter
that
but
i
let
you
off
part
of
your
agonies
if
you
tell
me
at
once
where
your
daughter
is
it
will
only
precipitate
matters
we
can
easily
find
her
as
you
must
know
i
do
like
talking
with
you
at
all
you
are
both
of
you
doomed
beyond
power
of
redemption
you
have
overcome
some
of
my
precautions
by
what
means
i
can
not
tell
you
captured
my
person
you
are
about
to
wreak
your
disgusting
vengeance
on
it
for
heaven
sake
do
so
you
know
nothing
of
this
place
you
are
in
or
very
little
fools
the
voice
rang
out
like
a
trumpet
there
was
a
murmured
conference
the
words
of
which
we
could
not
catch
then
midwinter
said
we
put
you
to
the
test
a
little
before
zorilla
really
begins
operating
adjoining
this
apartment
i
see
there
is
your
most
luxurious
bathroom
the
walls
of
onyx
the
bath
of
solid
silver
well
we
take
you
and
put
you
in
that
bath
and
turn
on
the
water
stand
over
you
and
with
my
hands
on
your
shoulders
i
plunge
you
an
inch
or
two
beneath
the
surface
till
you
are
so
nearly
drowned
that
you
taste
all
the
bitterness
of
death
then
we
have
you
up
again
and
ask
you
a
few
questions
perhaps
you
may
have
to
go
back
into
the
bath
a
second
time
before
zorilla
gets
to
the
real
work
no
words
of
mine
can
describe
the
malignancy
of
that
voice
no
words
of
mine
can
describe
the
shout
of
resolute
sardonic
laughter
which
answered
it
bill
wanted
to
shout
in
answer
but
i
clapped
my
hand
over
his
mouth
just
in
time
and
i
could
almost
see
the
frowning
faces
of
the
two
fiends
as
they
advanced
upon
the
bound
man
steps
overhead
the
little
bulb
over
the
mouthpiece
labeled
morse
study
goes
out
and
another
lights
up
over
the
mouthpiece
labeled
bathroom
there
is
a
jarring
as
a
tap
is
turned
on
and
a
rush
of
water
that
do
zorilla
two
feet
is
quite
enough
for
our
purpose
the
voices
are
actually
in
the
room
now
much
louder
and
clearer
than
before
you
take
the
heels
steady
heavo
and
then
a
splash
and
a
thud
we
heard
some
one
vaulting
lightly
into
the
bath
now
morse
i
hold
you
up
for
a
minute
i
shall
press
you
down
under
the
water
until
you
are
as
near
dead
as
a
man
can
be
have
you
anything
to
say
yes
give
me
one
moment
ten
if
you
like
then
there
came
in
a
calm
penetrating
voice
are
you
there
i
reached
upward
and
smote
with
my
clenched
fist
upon
the
outside
of
the
bath
i
heard
a
muttered
exclamation
a
slight
splash
and
then
bill
rolston
pulled
over
a
lever
and
half
the
ceiling
of
our
room
sank
towards
us
with
a
noise
like
the
of
a
clock
midwinter
was
standing
in
one
end
of
the
bath
which
hid
him
almost
up
to
his
waist
his
jaw
dropped
like
the
jaw
of
a
dead
man
such
baffled
hate
and
infinite
malevolence
stared
out
of
his
eyes
that
i
gave
a
shout
of
relief
as
rolston
lifted
his
arm
and
fired
he
must
have
missed
the
fiend
head
by
a
hair
breadth
no
more
quick
as
lightning
he
fired
again
but
he
was
too
late
midwinter
bounded
out
of
the
bath
like
a
tennis
ball
felled
rolston
with
a
blow
as
he
leapt
and
fled
down
the
passage
the
loud
thunder
of
the
explosions
in
that
underground
place
had
not
died
away
before
i
had
lifted
morse
from
under
the
water
and
dragged
him
over
the
side
of
the
bath
his
face
was
very
pale
but
his
eyes
were
open
and
he
could
speak
truly
the
man
was
marvelous
the
other
he
whispered
the
brute
zorilla
juanita
i
understood
one
of
the
devils
desperate
now
was
still
at
large
and
even
as
i
realized
it
i
saw
a
ghastly
sight
there
was
a
noise
above
i
bent
my
head
backward
and
looked
up
through
the
aperture
in
the
ceiling
a
man
was
crouching
over
it
and
i
saw
his
face
and
neck
a
big
face
with
eyes
like
blazing
coals
but
his
eyes
were
where
his
mouth
should
have
been
his
nostrils
were
like
two
pits
and
for
a
forehead
there
was
a
grinning
mouth
full
of
gleaming
teeth
any
one
who
when
ill
has
seen
their
nurse
or
attendant
bending
over
them
from
the
back
of
the
bed
will
realize
what
i
mean
though
they
can
never
understand
the
horror
of
that
demoniac
and
inverted
mask
i
was
pretty
quick
on
the
target
but
not
quick
enough
the
thing
whipped
away
even
as
i
fired
and
there
was
a
thunder
of
feet
running
i
think
a
sort
of
madness
seized
me
at
any
rate
i
was
never
in
a
moment
doubt
as
to
what
to
do
i
shoved
my
pistol
in
my
pocket
leapt
upon
the
edge
of
the
bath
sprang
upwards
and
caught
the
floor
of
the
room
above
with
my
hands
the
rest
was
easy
for
any
athlete
in
training
i
pulled
myself
up
lay
panting
for
a
second
and
then
stood
upon
the
tiled
floor
of
the
bathroom
the
door
leading
into
the
library
was
open
i
dashed
through
to
find
the
place
empty
rushed
through
the
hall
and
out
upon
the
steps
of
the
main
entrance
and
then
joy
a
morning
wind
had
begun
and
instead
of
a
white
impenetrable
wall
a
phantom
army
was
retreating
and
as
if
pursuing
those
sentinels
was
the
black
running
figure
of
zorilla
i
had
a
clear
glimpse
of
him
as
he
plunged
into
the
tunnel
leading
to
grand
square
and
i
was
after
him
like
a
slipped
greyhound
in
grand
square
it
was
clearing
up
with
a
vengeance
there
were
gleams
of
sunlight
here
and
there
and
the
mist
had
lifted
for
about
twelve
feet
above
my
head
i
saw
him
bolt
round
the
central
fountain
hidden
by
an
immense
bronze
dragon
for
a
moment
and
then
legging
it
for
all
he
was
worth
towards
the
way
that
led
to
the
lifts
for
the
second
stage
the
wood
floor
had
dried
with
the
lifting
of
the
mist
and
i
was
doing
strides
i
was
seeing
red
there
was
a
terrible
cold
fury
at
the
bottom
of
my
heart
but
in
my
mind
there
was
a
furious
joy
with
every
stride
i
gained
on
him
this
powerful
man
from
the
forests
of
the
amazon
i
gave
a
loud
exulting
and
the
black
head
turned
for
an
instant
he
lost
ten
good
yards
by
that
i
whooped
again
i
meant
to
kill
to
rend
him
in
pieces
and
for
the
first
time
in
my
life
i
realized
the
joy
of
primeval
man
the
lust
of
the
hunt
red
fang
red
claw
to
tear
dominate
and
destroy
oh
it
was
fine
hunting
damn
him
he
snapped
himself
into
one
of
the
little
lifts
when
i
was
within
six
yards
of
him
i
saw
his
ugly
face
sink
out
of
sight
behind
the
glass
panels
i
remembered
that
these
small
hydraulic
lifts
worked
though
the
big
ones
below
did
but
i
remembered
something
else
there
was
a
stairway
i
found
it
by
instinct
a
great
broad
stair
with
tiled
walls
like
the
subway
of
some
railway
terminus
i
did
bother
about
the
stairs
i
leapt
down
preserving
my
balance
by
a
miracle
six
or
seven
at
a
time
pounding
out
into
the
great
empty
city
at
the
foot
i
swirled
round
and
was
just
in
time
to
see
my
gentleman
bolt
out
of
his
lift
like
a
rabbit
from
its
hole
and
run
to
where
i
knew
was
the
outside
stairway
which
fell
in
its
corkscrew
path
barred
by
many
gates
right
down
to
safety
and
the
normal
world
it
was
the
way
by
which
dear
old
had
hoped
to
descend
and
raise
the
alarm
it
was
the
perilous
eyrie
upon
which
this
same
assassin
had
picked
him
off
like
a
sitting
pigeon
and
boasted
of
it
not
half
an
hour
before
as
he
dodged
and
ran
i
fired
at
him
but
never
a
bullet
touched
the
brute
and
i
flung
the
colt
away
with
an
oath
much
better
kill
him
with
my
own
hands
i
said
in
my
mind
much
better
tear
his
head
off
break
him
up
i
tell
you
this
as
it
happened
for
the
moment
i
was
a
wild
beast
in
pursuit
of
another
but
still
i
think
a
well
never
mind
that
i
saw
him
fumbling
at
a
sort
of
fence
clearly
outlined
against
an
immense
space
of
morning
sky
and
thundered
after
him
thundered
i
say
because
i
was
now
running
along
an
open
steel
grating
which
seemed
to
sway
then
i
vaulted
over
where
zorilla
had
vaulted
and
my
heart
leapt
into
my
mouth
as
i
fell
fell
some
eight
feet
on
to
a
tiny
platform
protected
from
space
by
a
rail
not
more
than
three
feet
high
i
reeled
and
caught
hold
of
a
stanchion
and
saved
myself
far
far
below
london
london
in
color
was
unrolling
itself
like
a
map
and
immediately
below
my
feet
already
a
considerable
distance
down
was
the
slithering
black
spider
that
i
had
sworn
to
kill
i
could
see
him
through
the
grid
and
then
i
flung
myself
upon
the
corkscrew
ladder
grasping
the
rails
with
my
hands
until
the
skin
was
burnt
from
them
disdaining
the
steps
and
spinning
round
and
ever
downwards
like
a
great
top
as
i
went
my
head
projected
at
right
angles
to
my
body
as
i
buzzed
down
that
sickening
height
i
saw
that
zorilla
had
stopped
i
knew
that
he
had
come
to
one
of
the
steel
gates
at
which
he
was
fumbling
uselessly
then
as
i
came
to
the
last
step
before
the
little
gate
platform
i
saw
also
under
the
curve
of
the
stair
a
huddled
figure
and
i
knew
who
was
who
that
had
been
i
threw
myself
at
zorilla
with
my
knee
in
the
small
of
his
back
instantly
i
caught
him
round
the
throat
with
my
fingers
just
on
the
big
veins
behind
the
ear
which
supply
the
brain
with
blood
and
my
fingers
crushed
the
trachea
until
the
whole
supple
throat
seemed
breaking
under
the
molding
of
my
grip
i
felt
that
i
had
got
him
that
if
i
could
hold
out
for
a
minute
he
would
be
dead
but
i
had
reckoned
with
the
immense
muscular
force
of
the
body
i
clung
like
the
leopard
on
the
buffalo
but
he
began
to
sway
this
way
and
that
in
front
of
us
was
the
steel
gate
and
the
motionless
figure
of
we
were
struggling
upon
the
steel
grid
not
much
larger
than
a
tea
table
a
slight
rail
only
three
feet
high
defended
us
from
the
void
a
little
rail
between
us
and
a
drop
of
near
two
thousand
feet
he
lurched
to
the
left
and
i
swung
out
into
immensity
carried
on
his
back
i
was
sure
it
was
the
end
that
i
should
be
flung
off
into
space
when
with
one
arm
he
gripped
the
gate
braced
all
his
great
strength
and
slowly
dragged
us
back
into
equilibrium
it
seemed
that
the
whole
tower
trembled
vibrated
in
a
horrible
metallic
music
i
pressed
down
my
thumbs
i
strained
every
sinew
of
my
wrist
and
arm
in
the
strangle
hold
and
i
felt
the
life
pulsing
out
of
him
in
steady
throbs
there
was
nothing
else
in
the
world
now
but
myself
and
him
and
i
ground
my
teeth
and
clutched
harder
in
his
death
agony
he
lurched
to
the
other
side
of
our
tiny
foothold
space
this
was
where
the
circular
stairway
ended
he
caught
his
foot
so
i
was
told
afterwards
in
the
last
stanchion
of
the
stair
fell
over
the
rail
with
a
low
sobbing
groan
and
then
weighted
by
me
upon
his
shoulders
began
to
slip
slip
slip
downwards
and
i
with
him
i
had
conquered
i
do
think
that
in
that
moment
i
had
any
feeling
but
one
of
wild
fierce
joy
he
was
going
i
was
going
with
him
but
i
never
thought
of
that
until
my
right
ankle
was
clutched
in
a
grip
i
felt
the
warm
heaving
body
below
me
rush
away
tearing
my
grip
from
its
throat
by
its
own
dreadful
impetus
and
then
as
i
was
snatched
back
with
a
jar
of
every
bone
in
my
body
there
was
a
shrill
whistling
of
air
for
a
second
as
zorilla
went
headlong
to
his
doom
and
i
knew
nothing
else
chapter
thirteen
falling
falling
through
deep
waters
with
a
horrible
sickening
sense
of
utter
helplessness
and
desolation
nerves
heart
mind
very
being
itself
awaited
the
crash
of
extinction
a
slight
jolt
a
roaring
of
great
waters
in
the
air
and
a
voice
dim
thin
and
far
away
in
some
mysterious
way
the
sense
of
sight
was
joined
to
that
of
sound
and
hearing
i
was
surrounded
by
blackness
shot
with
gleams
of
baleful
fire
shifting
and
changing
until
the
black
grew
gray
in
furious
eddies
the
gray
changed
into
the
light
of
day
and
a
voice
became
loud
and
insistent
it
was
thus
that
i
came
to
myself
after
the
horror
on
the
edge
of
the
dizzy
void
the
first
thing
i
saw
was
the
face
of
juanita
there
were
tears
in
her
eyes
and
her
cheeks
were
brilliant
then
i
heard
and
even
then
with
a
start
a
voice
that
i
had
never
thought
to
hear
again
the
gentle
tripping
accents
of
he
will
do
now
señorita
the
doctor
said
that
he
would
awake
from
his
sleep
with
very
little
the
matter
except
the
shock
juanita
i
cried
and
her
cool
hand
came
down
upon
my
forehead
you
are
not
to
excite
yourself
dearest
she
said
for
a
moment
or
two
i
lay
there
in
a
waking
swoon
of
puzzled
but
entire
bliss
then
i
tried
to
move
my
position
slightly
upon
the
bed
for
i
was
lying
upon
a
bed
in
a
large
and
airy
room
and
groaned
aloud
every
muscle
in
my
body
seemed
stretched
as
if
upon
the
rack
and
there
was
a
pain
like
a
iron
in
one
ankle
it
will
hurt
for
a
few
hours
said
but
you
will
shortly
be
massaged
sir
thomas
and
then
you
i
cried
but
you
are
dead
zorilla
got
you
on
the
tower
before
before
my
mind
leapt
up
into
full
activity
i
was
once
more
swaying
upon
the
edge
of
infinity
with
my
fingers
locked
in
the
bull
neck
of
the
assassin
and
my
voice
died
away
into
a
whisper
of
horror
he
stunned
me
that
was
all
sir
thomas
his
bullet
glanced
away
from
my
head
i
came
to
myself
just
in
time
to
see
you
struggling
with
him
and
gripped
you
just
as
you
were
falling
off
into
space
the
spirits
of
my
ancestors
were
with
me
and
he
zorilla
will
never
trouble
us
more
but
you
are
not
well
enough
yet
to
talk
you
are
in
my
hands
for
the
present
do
exactly
as
says
dear
and
remember
that
all
is
well
your
father
i
gasped
why
had
i
thought
of
morse
before
all
is
well
she
repeated
in
her
low
musical
voice
and
as
i
lay
back
trembling
once
more
upon
the
edge
of
unconsciousness
her
face
left
the
circle
of
my
vision
two
deft
chinese
came
i
was
placed
in
a
hot
bath
impregnated
with
some
strong
salts
i
was
kneaded
and
pummeled
until
i
could
hardly
repress
cries
of
pain
i
drank
a
cup
of
hot
soup
in
which
there
must
have
been
some
soporific
and
sank
into
a
deep
refreshing
sleep
it
had
been
late
afternoon
when
i
first
came
to
myself
when
i
woke
for
the
second
time
it
was
night
the
room
was
brilliantly
lit
was
sitting
by
my
bedside
quietly
smoking
a
long
chinese
pipe
and
for
my
part
though
i
was
very
stiff
i
was
in
full
possession
of
all
my
faculties
and
knew
that
i
had
suffered
no
harm
i
sat
up
in
bed
and
held
out
my
hand
to
the
chinaman
i
all
right
now
i
owe
my
life
to
you
and
as
i
realized
my
extraordinary
deliverance
in
the
very
article
of
death
a
sob
burst
from
me
and
i
am
not
ashamed
to
say
that
my
eyes
filled
with
tears
my
hand
is
as
strong
as
most
men
but
i
almost
winced
at
the
grip
of
those
artistic
fingers
you
did
the
same
for
me
my
honorable
friend
he
said
quietly
and
now
before
i
knew
what
he
would
be
at
he
was
feeling
my
pulse
and
listening
to
my
heart
with
his
ear
against
my
chest
at
length
he
gave
a
sigh
of
relief
we
had
a
doctor
to
you
he
said
and
he
told
us
that
in
his
opinion
you
would
be
little
the
worse
i
am
rejoiced
that
his
opinion
is
confirmed
oh
i
am
all
right
now
and
ready
for
anything
you
are
sure
sir
thomas
what
you
have
been
through
may
have
given
you
a
shock
which
for
answer
i
held
out
my
hand
it
was
as
firm
as
a
rock
and
did
not
tremble
i
heaved
myself
off
the
bed
took
a
cigarette
from
a
box
upon
a
table
and
began
to
smoke
now
then
i
am
just
as
i
was
before
first
of
all
where
am
i
you
are
in
the
palacete
he
replied
you
were
brought
here
at
once
then
i
knew
that
i
was
in
morse
dwelling
house
copied
exactly
as
i
have
said
before
from
the
palacete
mendoza
at
rio
now
tell
me
exactly
what
has
happened
in
as
few
words
as
possible
i
am
only
too
anxious
to
do
so
sir
thomas
you
were
brought
back
here
immediately
after
rolston
descended
by
means
of
the
outside
stair
and
summoned
the
staff
they
are
all
here
now
the
electric
cables
have
been
repaired
lifts
telephones
electric
light
and
all
the
other
machinery
is
in
working
order
the
body
of
zorilla
has
been
brought
up
to
the
city
and
placed
with
that
of
mulligan
and
my
own
servant
this
house
is
strongly
guarded
by
armed
men
and
the
whole
city
is
patrolled
no
one
else
was
hurt
no
one
else
at
all
sir
thomas
his
face
changed
as
he
said
this
and
he
looked
me
full
in
the
eyes
then
with
a
start
i
understood
every
detail
of
the
past
came
back
in
a
vivid
instantaneous
picture
again
i
saw
the
silver
bath
descending
from
the
ceiling
and
heard
the
loud
explosion
of
rolston
pistol
and
as
that
furious
noise
resounded
in
my
mental
ear
once
more
the
grinning
face
of
mark
antony
midwinter
passed
close
to
mine
and
i
felt
the
very
wind
of
his
passage
as
he
rushed
by
and
disappeared
down
the
long
underground
corridor
leading
to
the
midwinter
i
almost
shouted
the
face
of
the
chinaman
had
gone
a
dusky
gray
he
told
me
afterwards
that
mine
was
white
as
linen
vanished
he
said
disappeared
utterly
and
he
is
the
while
mark
antony
midwinter
is
alive
morse
none
of
us
will
know
a
moment
of
safety
or
of
ease
i
could
not
quarrel
with
that
zorilla
was
dead
a
great
gain
but
no
one
who
had
been
through
what
i
had
and
who
knew
the
whole
situation
as
i
knew
it
could
fail
to
appreciate
the
terrible
seriousness
of
this
news
to
you
who
read
this
record
in
peace
and
safety
this
may
seem
a
wild
or
exaggerated
statement
a
product
of
nerves
but
believe
me
it
was
not
so
i
knew
too
much
the
securest
fortress
in
the
whole
world
had
been
already
stormed
all
the
precautions
that
enormous
wealth
and
some
of
the
subtlest
brains
alive
could
take
had
already
proved
useless
against
the
superhuman
cunning
energy
and
ferocity
of
this
being
who
seemed
indeed
literally
more
fiend
than
man
no
we
were
no
cowards
most
of
us
up
there
in
the
city
of
the
clouds
but
we
might
well
quail
still
to
know
that
this
fury
was
unchained
i
know
that
i
sat
down
suddenly
upon
the
bed
with
a
groan
of
despair
gone
vanished
surely
he
must
be
either
in
the
city
or
has
escaped
if
he
is
in
the
city
i
admit
the
danger
is
imminent
he
must
be
utterly
desperate
and
will
stick
at
nothing
if
he
has
managed
to
get
down
to
the
earth
he
is
dangerous
still
but
we
have
a
breathing
space
which
is
it
we
do
not
know
sir
thomas
there
is
no
trace
of
him
anywhere
so
far
but
as
i
have
said
we
have
more
than
a
hundred
men
armed
and
patrolling
the
city
this
house
at
any
rate
is
secure
for
the
moment
a
great
search
is
being
organized
the
whole
area
is
being
mapped
out
and
it
will
be
searched
with
such
thoroughness
before
dawn
that
a
rat
could
not
escape
my
own
theory
is
and
morse
agrees
with
me
that
midwinter
is
still
in
the
city
the
most
scrupulous
inquiries
below
seem
to
prove
that
he
never
descended
from
the
tower
and
you
know
how
minute
and
careful
our
organization
is
and
now
that
you
are
yourself
again
it
is
morse
wish
that
we
hold
a
conference
and
settle
exactly
what
is
to
be
done
do
you
think
you
are
equal
to
it
perfectly
i
replied
and
without
another
word
led
the
way
out
of
the
room
i
found
morse
sitting
in
his
library
he
was
pale
and
seemed
much
shaken
there
were
red
rims
round
the
keen
masterful
eyes
but
his
voice
was
strong
and
resolute
and
i
could
see
that
whatever
his
opinion
of
his
chances
he
would
fight
till
the
end
i
need
not
go
into
details
of
the
private
conversation
we
had
for
a
minute
or
two
his
gratitude
was
pathetic
and
i
felt
more
drawn
to
him
than
ever
before
when
at
length
juanita
followed
by
little
rolston
entered
the
room
all
trace
of
his
emotion
had
gone
and
we
settled
down
round
the
table
as
calm
and
as
a
board
of
directors
in
a
bank
and
yet
you
know
no
group
of
people
in
europe
stood
in
such
peril
as
we
did
then
behind
the
long
silken
curtains
the
shutters
were
of
steel
the
corridor
outside
the
gardens
of
the
house
swarmed
with
men
armed
to
the
teeth
it
was
dark
in
the
sky
but
the
city
in
the
clouds
blazed
everywhere
with
an
artificial
sunlight
from
the
great
electric
lamps
two
thousand
feet
up
in
the
air
we
sat
and
spoke
in
quiet
voices
of
the
horror
that
was
past
and
the
horror
that
threatened
us
far
down
below
london
was
waking
up
to
a
night
of
pleasure
people
were
dressing
for
dinners
and
the
theater
thousands
upon
thousands
of
toilers
had
left
their
work
and
were
about
to
enjoy
the
hours
of
rest
and
recreation
and
not
a
soul
probably
among
all
those
millions
that
crawled
like
ants
at
our
feet
had
the
least
suspicion
of
what
was
going
on
in
our
high
place
they
were
accustomed
to
the
great
towers
now
the
sensation
of
their
building
was
over
and
done
there
were
no
more
thrills
if
they
had
only
known
i
was
not
aware
if
strata
of
clouds
hid
us
from
the
world
below
as
so
often
happened
but
if
the
night
were
clear
i
do
remember
thinking
that
any
one
who
cast
their
eyes
up
into
the
sky
might
well
notice
an
unusual
brilliancy
in
the
pleasure
city
of
the
millionaire
that
mysterious
theater
of
the
unknown
which
dominated
the
greatest
city
in
the
world
well
tom
said
morse
tells
me
that
you
are
now
acquainted
with
all
the
facts
the
question
we
have
to
decide
is
what
are
we
to
do
he
turned
to
juanita
and
nodded
she
left
the
room
the
situation
as
i
understand
it
i
replied
is
that
midwinter
i
had
a
curious
reluctance
in
pronouncing
the
name
aloud
is
either
concealed
here
in
the
city
or
has
made
his
escape
if
he
is
here
we
shall
know
before
morning
shall
we
not
precisely
i
have
spent
the
last
hour
in
going
over
the
plans
of
the
city
with
the
chiefs
of
the
staff
we
have
divided
up
the
two
stages
into
small
sections
and
even
while
i
am
talking
to
you
the
search
has
begun
the
orders
are
to
shoot
at
sight
to
kill
that
man
with
less
compunction
than
one
would
kill
a
mad
dog
if
he
is
really
here
he
can
not
possibly
escape
very
well
then
i
said
let
us
turn
our
attention
to
the
other
possibility
assuming
that
he
has
got
away
i
think
we
may
safely
say
that
the
danger
is
very
much
lessened
while
we
remain
here
in
the
city
yes
morse
agreed
and
you
are
determined
to
do
that
he
took
the
cigar
he
had
been
smoking
from
his
lips
and
his
hand
shook
a
little
think
what
you
like
of
me
he
said
but
remember
that
there
is
juanita
i
say
to
you
kirby
that
if
i
never
descend
to
the
world
again
alive
i
must
stay
here
until
mark
antony
midwinter
is
dead
well
i
had
already
made
up
my
mind
on
this
point
i
think
you
are
quite
right
i
told
him
still
he
will
not
make
a
second
appearance
in
the
city
you
can
treble
your
precautions
he
must
be
attacked
down
in
the
world
then
a
thought
struck
me
for
the
first
time
but
how
i
said
did
he
and
zorilla
ever
come
here
in
the
first
instance
treachery
among
the
staff
it
is
the
only
explanation
shook
his
head
you
may
put
that
out
of
your
mind
sir
thomas
he
said
that
is
my
department
i
know
what
you
can
not
know
about
my
chosen
compatriots
but
the
man
is
a
specter
he
a
devil
incarnate
but
nothing
supernatural
about
him
then
little
rolston
spoke
i
been
down
below
all
day
he
said
and
though
i
have
discovered
anything
of
midwinter
i
am
certain
of
how
he
and
zorilla
got
here
we
all
turned
to
him
with
startled
faces
do
you
remember
sir
thomas
he
said
that
shortly
after
your
arrival
when
you
were
looking
down
upon
london
from
one
of
the
galleries
there
was
a
big
fair
in
richmond
park
i
remembered
and
said
so
among
the
other
attractions
there
was
a
captive
balloon
morse
brought
his
hand
heavily
down
upon
the
table
with
a
loud
exclamation
in
spanish
yes
there
was
but
but
it
was
quite
half
a
mile
away
and
never
came
up
anything
like
our
height
here
no
the
boy
answered
not
at
that
time
but
do
you
remember
how
during
the
fog
last
night
i
told
you
i
had
seen
something
or
thought
i
had
seen
something
like
a
group
of
statuary
falling
before
my
bedroom
window
something
seemed
to
snap
in
my
mind
good
heavens
and
i
thought
it
was
merely
a
trick
of
the
mist
nothing
was
discovered
no
but
in
view
of
what
happened
afterwards
i
formed
a
theory
i
put
it
to
the
test
this
morning
i
made
a
few
inquiries
as
to
the
proprietors
of
the
captive
balloon
and
the
engine
which
wound
it
up
and
down
by
means
of
a
steel
cable
on
a
drum
i
need
not
go
into
details
at
the
moment
but
the
whole
apparatus
did
not
leave
richmond
park
when
it
was
supposed
to
do
so
the
wind
was
drifting
in
the
right
direction
the
balloon
could
be
more
or
less
controlled
certainly
as
to
height
i
have
learned
that
there
was
a
telephone
from
the
car
down
to
the
ground
desperate
men
resolved
to
stick
at
nothing
might
well
have
arranged
for
the
balloon
to
rise
above
the
city
the
cable
was
quite
long
enough
for
that
and
descend
upon
part
of
it
by
means
of
a
parachute
or
if
not
that
a
hanging
rope
more
dangerous
feats
than
that
have
been
done
in
the
air
and
are
upon
record
it
seems
to
me
there
is
no
doubt
whatever
that
this
is
the
way
the
two
men
broke
through
all
our
precautions
there
was
a
long
silence
when
he
had
spoken
mendoza
morse
leant
back
in
his
chair
with
the
perspiration
glittering
in
little
beads
upon
his
face
but
he
wore
an
aspect
of
relief
you
sure
got
it
my
friend
he
said
at
length
that
was
how
the
trick
was
done
it
was
the
one
possibility
which
had
never
occurred
to
me
and
hence
we
were
unprovided
well
that
relieves
my
mind
to
a
certain
extent
we
can
take
it
that
we
are
safe
in
the
city
if
midwinter
has
escaped
how
are
we
to
make
an
end
of
him
the
difficulty
is
i
said
that
we
are
so
to
speak
both
literally
and
actually
above
or
outside
the
law
if
that
were
not
so
if
ordinary
methods
could
deal
with
this
man
or
could
have
dealt
with
the
hermandad
in
the
past
morse
would
never
have
planned
and
built
the
eighth
wonder
of
the
world
no
word
of
what
has
happened
in
the
last
day
or
two
must
get
down
to
the
public
is
that
so
morse
nodded
it
goes
without
saying
he
said
we
have
our
own
law
in
the
city
in
the
clouds
at
the
present
moment
there
are
three
bodies
awaiting
final
disposal
and
there
wo
be
any
inquest
on
them
that
rolston
broke
in
was
something
i
was
waiting
to
hear
important
he
stopped
and
looked
at
me
with
his
usual
modesty
as
if
waiting
permission
to
speak
i
smiled
at
him
and
he
went
on
it
is
an
absolute
necessity
he
said
to
enter
into
the
psychology
of
midwinter
we
may
be
sure
that
his
purpose
is
as
strong
as
ever
the
death
of
zorilla
and
his
present
failure
will
not
deter
him
in
the
least
knowing
what
we
know
of
him
he
looked
inquiringly
at
morse
it
wo
turn
him
a
hair
breadth
said
the
millionaire
if
he
was
mad
with
and
hatred
before
he
must
be
ten
times
worse
now
so
i
thought
sir
he
has
lost
his
companion
as
desperate
and
as
cunning
as
himself
but
we
can
be
quite
certain
that
he
is
not
without
resources
i
think
it
safe
to
assume
that
he
has
practically
an
unlimited
supply
of
money
he
must
have
other
confederates
though
whether
they
are
in
his
full
confidence
or
not
is
a
debatable
question
that
however
at
the
moment
is
not
of
great
importance
we
have
him
in
london
let
us
suppose
for
it
is
the
safest
place
in
the
world
for
a
man
to
hide
in
london
determined
and
hungering
for
revenge
we
have
no
idea
what
his
next
scheme
will
be
and
in
all
human
probability
he
has
planned
either
he
must
be
considerably
shaken
he
will
know
now
how
tremendously
strong
our
defenses
are
and
it
will
not
escape
a
man
of
his
intelligence
that
they
will
now
be
greatly
strengthened
it
will
take
him
some
time
to
gather
his
wits
together
and
work
out
another
scheme
the
only
thing
to
do
it
seems
to
me
is
to
force
his
hand
and
how
morse
and
i
said
simultaneously
we
must
trap
him
not
here
at
all
but
down
there
in
london
he
made
a
little
gesture
towards
the
floor
with
his
hand
and
as
he
did
so
once
more
the
strange
and
eerie
remembrance
of
where
we
were
came
over
me
lost
for
a
time
in
the
comfortable
seclusion
of
a
room
that
might
have
been
in
berkeley
square
here
that
is
the
press
come
in
said
rolston
smiling
proudly
at
me
i
smiled
inwardly
at
the
grandiloquence
of
the
tone
and
yet
how
true
it
was
this
lad
who
so
short
a
time
ago
had
got
to
see
me
by
a
trick
was
certainly
the
most
brilliant
modern
journalist
i
had
ever
met
i
made
him
a
little
bow
and
delighted
beyond
measure
he
continued
let
it
be
put
about
he
said
with
plenty
of
detail
rumor
contradiction
of
the
rumor
and
so
on
in
fact
we
will
get
up
a
little
stunt
about
it
that
mendoza
morse
has
tired
of
his
whim
for
a
time
at
any
rate
he
is
going
to
make
his
reappearance
in
the
world
if
necessary
announce
miss
juanita
engagement
to
sir
thomas
get
all
london
interested
and
excited
again
morse
nodded
his
face
wrinkled
with
thought
i
think
i
see
he
said
but
go
on
when
this
is
done
let
us
put
ourselves
in
midwinter
place
i
believe
that
he
will
have
no
suspicion
of
a
trap
he
will
argue
it
in
this
way
we
are
too
much
afraid
of
him
to
attack
ourselves
hitherto
all
our
measures
have
been
measures
of
defense
and
escape
it
will
hardly
occur
to
him
that
we
have
changed
all
our
tactics
he
will
think
that
with
the
failure
of
his
attempt
the
bad
failure
and
the
death
of
zorilla
which
i
have
no
doubt
he
will
have
discovered
by
now
we
imagine
he
will
abandon
all
his
attempts
he
will
say
to
himself
that
we
now
believe
ourselves
safe
and
that
his
power
is
over
his
initiative
broken
that
he
will
never
dare
to
go
on
with
his
campaign
everything
seems
in
favor
of
it
i
should
say
that
it
is
a
hundred
to
one
that
his
line
of
thought
will
be
precisely
as
i
have
said
by
jove
and
i
think
so
too
good
for
you
rolston
i
shouted
seeing
where
he
was
going
his
boyish
face
was
wreathed
in
smiles
thank
you
he
said
well
we
are
to
lay
a
trap
and
it
is
on
the
details
of
that
trap
that
everything
depends
i
see
by
that
birmingham
house
in
berkeley
square
is
to
let
the
duke
is
ordered
a
long
cruise
in
the
pacific
let
morse
immediately
take
the
house
and
issue
invitations
for
a
great
ball
to
celebrate
miss
juanita
engagement
if
that
house
and
that
ball
are
not
to
midwinter
as
a
candle
is
to
a
moth
then
my
theory
is
useless
somehow
or
other
he
will
be
there
either
before
or
actually
on
the
occasion
by
some
means
or
other
he
will
get
into
the
house
he
stopped
and
with
a
little
apologetic
look
took
out
his
cigarette
case
and
began
to
smoke
he
really
was
wonderful
this
was
the
lad
airily
ordering
one
of
the
richest
men
in
the
world
to
take
the
duke
of
birmingham
great
mansion
whose
capital
but
a
few
short
weeks
ago
was
one
penny
bronze
i
remember
how
he
was
forced
to
confess
it
to
me
even
as
i
congratulated
him
we
talked
on
for
another
or
rather
little
bill
rolston
talked
the
rest
of
us
only
putting
in
a
word
now
and
then
he
seemed
to
have
mapped
out
every
detail
of
the
new
campaign
and
we
were
content
to
listen
and
admire
of
course
i
am
not
a
person
without
original
ideas
or
unaccustomed
to
organization
my
career
such
as
it
is
has
proved
that
but
on
that
night
at
least
i
could
initiate
nothing
and
i
was
even
glad
when
the
conference
came
to
an
end
morse
was
much
the
same
he
confessed
it
to
me
as
we
left
the
room
and
the
truth
is
that
we
were
both
feeling
the
results
of
the
terrible
shocks
we
had
undergone
rolston
was
younger
and
fresher
and
besides
his
peril
had
not
been
as
great
as
mine
or
the
millionaire
vanished
in
his
mysterious
fashion
and
morse
rolston
and
i
went
to
dinner
there
was
no
question
of
dressing
on
such
a
night
as
this
but
if
you
believe
me
the
meal
was
a
merry
one
it
was
juanita
whim
to
have
dinner
served
in
a
wonderful
conservatory
built
out
on
that
side
of
the
palacete
which
looked
upon
the
gardens
separating
it
from
the
eastern
villa
where
rolston
and
i
were
housed
the
place
was
yet
another
of
the
fantastic
marvels
conjured
up
by
morse
and
his
millions
it
was
an
exact
reproduction
of
a
similar
conservatory
at
my
host
house
in
rio
de
janeiro
and
had
been
carried
out
at
a
frightful
cost
by
the
greatest
landscape
gardener
and
the
most
celebrated
scenic
artist
in
existence
we
sat
at
a
little
table
surrounded
by
tall
palm
trees
rising
from
thick
tropical
undergrowth
a
gay
striped
awning
was
over
our
heads
protecting
us
from
what
seemed
brilliant
sunshine
on
every
side
was
the
golden
rain
of
mimosa
masses
of
deep
crimson
blossoms
and
magnolia
flowers
from
a
marble
pool
of
clear
water
sprang
a
little
fountain
a
laughing
rod
of
diamonds
in
the
distance
seen
over
a
marble
balustrade
was
the
deep
blue
of
the
tropic
sea
dominated
by
the
great
mountain
the
pão
de
azucar
it
was
an
illusion
of
course
but
it
was
perfect
that
sea
and
the
gleaming
mountain
which
from
where
we
sat
seemed
so
real
was
but
a
cleverly
painted
cloth
the
warm
and
scented
air
came
to
us
through
concealed
pipes
and
down
in
the
lower
portion
of
the
city
patient
chinamen
were
at
work
to
produce
it
the
sunlight
actually
as
brilliant
as
real
sunlight
was
the
result
of
a
costly
installation
of
those
marvelous
and
newly
invented
lamps
which
are
used
in
the
great
cinema
studios
only
the
trees
and
the
flowers
were
real
outside
it
was
a
keen
cold
night
we
were
perched
on
the
top
of
gaunt
steel
towers
more
than
two
thousand
feet
in
the
air
and
yet
i
swear
to
you
all
thought
of
our
surroundings
and
even
of
our
peril
was
banished
for
a
brief
and
laughing
hour
like
the
tired
traveler
in
some
clearing
of
those
lovely
south
american
forests
from
which
the
wealth
of
morse
had
sprung
we
had
forgotten
the
patient
jaguar
that
follows
in
the
for
a
week
of
days
to
strike
at
last
i
dwell
upon
this
scene
because
it
was
another
of
those
little
interludes
during
my
life
in
the
city
of
the
clouds
which
stand
out
in
such
brilliant
relief
from
the
encircling
horrors
juanita
was
in
the
highest
spirits
i
had
never
seen
her
more
lovely
or
more
animated
morse
himself
always
a
trifle
grim
unbent
to
a
sardonic
humor
he
told
us
story
after
story
of
his
early
life
with
shrewd
flashes
of
wit
and
wisdom
revealing
the
keen
and
mordaunt
intellect
which
had
made
him
what
he
was
a
wonderful
pink
champagne
from
austria
looted
from
the
imperial
cellars
during
the
war
and
priceless
even
then
poured
new
life
into
our
veins
it
was
impossible
to
believe
in
the
tragedy
of
the
last
few
hours
in
the
shadow
of
any
tragedy
to
come
we
adjourned
to
the
after
dinner
an
apartment
paneled
in
and
with
a
wagon
roof
and
juanita
played
and
sang
to
us
for
a
time
it
was
just
ten
when
rolston
looked
at
his
watch
and
gave
me
a
significant
glance
i
rose
and
said
both
morse
and
juanita
announcing
their
intention
of
going
to
bed
as
we
came
to
the
outside
door
bill
turned
to
me
had
you
better
go
back
to
our
house
sir
thomas
and
sleep
remember
what
you
have
been
through
sleep
i
could
sleep
if
i
tried
i
feel
as
fit
and
well
as
ever
i
did
why
i
promised
to
meet
in
the
office
of
the
chief
of
the
staff
reports
will
be
coming
in
of
the
search
which
has
been
going
on
all
the
evening
i
am
anxious
to
see
how
far
it
has
got
though
of
course
if
midwinter
had
been
found
or
any
trace
of
him
we
should
have
been
informed
at
once
and
there
is
something
else
also
he
stopped
and
i
made
no
inquiries
well
i
with
you
i
said
for
i
felt
ready
for
anything
that
might
come
in
a
state
of
absolute
pleasant
acquiescence
in
the
present
and
the
future
i
had
a
tremor
of
fear
or
anxiety
one
of
those
noiseless
toy
electric
automobiles
which
i
had
already
seen
when
juanita
first
showed
me
the
city
was
waiting
we
got
in
and
buzzed
through
the
gardens
and
down
the
tunnel
which
led
to
grand
square
as
we
went
i
saw
shadowy
figures
patrolling
everywhere
the
whole
place
was
alive
with
guards
my
girl
could
sleep
well
this
night
as
we
came
out
of
the
tunnel
i
motioned
to
bill
to
go
slowly
and
he
pulled
the
lever
or
whatever
it
was
that
controlled
the
speed
in
almost
complete
silence
we
began
to
circle
the
huge
inclosure
the
tires
making
no
noise
whatever
upon
the
floor
of
wood
blocks
the
air
was
keen
cold
and
wonderfully
pure
there
was
not
a
cloud
in
the
heavens
and
one
looked
up
at
a
vault
of
black
velvet
spangled
with
gold
never
had
i
seen
the
stars
so
clear
and
brilliant
in
england
for
the
haze
of
smoke
and
the
miasma
of
overbreathed
air
which
is
the
natural
atmosphere
of
london
lay
two
thousand
feet
below
the
grand
square
blazed
with
light
the
buildings
with
their
spires
domes
and
cupolas
stood
out
with
extraordinary
clearness
against
the
circumambient
black
of
space
no
outline
was
soft
or
blurred
everything
was
vividly
fantastically
real
a
veritable
scene
from
the
old
arabian
nights
indeed
and
something
of
the
same
thought
must
have
come
to
my
companion
for
he
looked
up
and
said
i
once
saw
an
extraordinary
illustration
by
willy
pogany
of
one
of
de
quincey
opium
dreams
here
it
is
only
a
thousand
times
more
marvelous
the
fountain
in
the
middle
of
the
square
a
long
distance
away
it
seemed
as
we
slowly
skirted
the
buildings
made
a
ghostly
laughter
as
it
sprang
from
its
basin
of
bronze
the
gilded
cupola
of
the
observatory
shone
with
a
wan
radiance
higher
than
all
else
and
a
black
triangle
in
the
gold
told
me
that
the
patient
old
chinese
astronomer
surveyed
the
heavens
lost
in
a
waking
dream
of
the
infinite
probably
loftily
unconscious
of
all
that
had
been
going
on
in
the
magic
city
at
his
feet
i
envied
that
serene
oriental
philosopher
special
friend
and
pet
who
lived
up
there
in
his
observatory
and
so
i
was
told
hardly
ever
descended
for
any
purpose
at
all
he
was
as
inviolate
a
hermit
as
saint
anthony
it
was
especially
curious
that
i
should
have
cast
my
glance
heavenwards
and
have
thought
of
that
ancient
sage
at
this
moment
you
will
learn
why
afterwards
we
stopped
at
one
of
the
white
kiosks
from
the
interior
of
which
the
hydraulic
lifts
went
down
to
the
lower
part
of
the
city
it
was
in
an
upper
story
of
that
that
the
chief
of
the
staff
had
his
office
and
mounting
a
flight
of
steps
we
entered
to
find
sitting
at
a
desk
scrutinizing
a
handful
of
paper
reports
it
is
nearly
over
sir
thomas
he
said
rising
and
placing
chairs
for
us
almost
every
inch
of
the
city
has
been
searched
and
but
little
remains
to
be
done
there
is
not
a
single
trace
of
the
man
midwinter
i
own
that
to
hear
this
was
a
great
relief
we
were
all
of
us
fired
with
rolston
plan
of
a
trap
down
below
in
london
his
theory
seemed
to
be
correct
midwinter
had
somehow
escaped
and
we
should
meet
him
in
due
time
for
i
had
never
a
doubt
of
that
meanwhile
juanita
and
her
father
were
safe
it
is
only
what
i
expected
though
how
on
earth
he
managed
to
get
away
remains
to
be
seen
it
will
come
to
light
in
due
course
replied
and
now
sir
thomas
are
you
prepared
to
accompany
me
and
rolston
there
are
certain
things
to
be
done
and
i
shall
be
glad
to
have
you
as
a
witness
anything
you
like
but
what
is
it
you
must
remember
that
the
bodies
of
three
dead
men
await
disposal
he
replied
what
remains
of
zorilla
he
fell
into
the
lake
on
the
first
stage
though
of
course
he
was
dead
strangled
in
long
before
the
impact
then
there
is
mulligan
who
died
in
defense
of
the
city
finally
sen
the
boy
from
my
own
province
in
china
of
whose
terrible
end
you
are
aware
what
are
you
going
to
do
i
asked
we
must
keep
to
our
policy
of
secrecy
and
noninterference
by
the
outside
world
the
bodies
must
be
destroyed
and
by
fire
i
gave
a
little
inward
shudder
but
i
do
think
he
noticed
it
and
in
a
minute
more
we
were
dropping
to
the
lower
city
in
a
rapid
lift
it
was
in
a
that
provided
some
of
the
hot
air
for
the
conservatories
on
the
stage
above
that
i
witnessed
the
ghastly
and
unceremonious
finish
of
the
mortal
parts
of
the
spaniard
and
the
irishman
and
it
was
cruel
and
sordid
to
a
degree
or
so
it
seemed
to
me
the
long
bundle
of
sacking
which
contained
that
which
had
housed
the
evil
soul
of
señor
don
zorilla
y
toro
i
resisted
a
bland
invitation
on
the
part
of
a
stoker
in
a
blue
jumper
and
a
pleased
smile
to
examine
the
stiff
horror
was
slung
through
an
iron
door
into
a
white
and
glowing
core
of
flame
there
was
a
clang
as
the
long
steel
rods
of
the
firemen
pushed
it
to
and
i
can
not
say
that
i
felt
much
regret
only
a
sort
of
shuddering
sickness
and
relief
that
the
door
was
closed
so
swiftly
but
it
was
different
in
the
case
of
mulligan
i
blamed
morse
in
my
heart
the
man
had
been
strangled
when
saying
his
prayers
he
was
of
the
millionaire
own
religion
and
there
should
have
been
a
priest
to
assist
at
these
fiery
obsequies
of
a
faithful
servant
i
learned
afterwards
i
am
glad
to
say
that
morse
had
not
been
consulted
and
knew
nothing
about
the
actual
disposal
of
the
bodies
until
afterwards
you
see
the
shock
came
rolston
felt
it
too
from
the
fact
that
these
bland
and
silent
asiatics
were
utterly
without
any
emotion
as
they
performed
their
task
they
were
heathens
worshiping
heaven
knows
what
in
their
tortuous
and
secret
souls
as
poor
mulligan
they
had
put
the
body
in
a
coffin
and
it
took
eight
struggling
sweating
orientals
to
hoist
and
slide
it
into
the
furnace
vanished
from
my
eyes
i
put
my
hands
before
my
face
and
said
such
portions
of
the
protestant
burial
service
as
i
remembered
and
they
were
very
few
they
nasty
beasts
are
they
sir
thomas
rolston
whispered
as
we
fled
the
furnace
room
soulless
just
like
machines
we
waited
for
for
a
minute
or
two
i
thank
you
sir
thomas
and
rolston
he
said
in
his
calm
silky
voice
it
was
as
well
that
you
saw
the
disposal
of
the
dead
though
it
is
only
a
remote
contingency
that
there
will
ever
be
inquiry
and
now
if
you
wish
i
will
send
you
up
again
i
myself
must
attend
to
the
obsequies
of
my
compatriot
oh
i
remarked
and
i
fear
my
tone
was
far
from
pleasant
you
propose
to
be
rather
more
ceremonious
in
the
case
of
the
lad
sen
for
a
single
moment
i
saw
that
calm
and
gentle
face
disturbed
something
looked
out
of
it
that
was
not
good
to
see
but
it
was
gone
in
a
flash
this
was
the
first
and
last
time
that
i
had
a
shadow
of
disagreement
with
the
man
whose
life
i
had
saved
and
who
saved
mine
in
return
it
was
natural
i
think
neither
of
us
was
to
blame
east
is
east
and
west
is
west
and
there
are
some
points
at
least
at
which
they
can
never
meet
poor
he
had
as
fine
an
intellect
as
any
man
i
ever
met
and
was
a
great
gentleman
i
wish
i
could
look
upon
him
once
more
as
i
write
this
but
though
i
did
know
it
the
sand
in
the
glass
was
nearly
out
and
our
hours
together
dwindling
fast
we
followed
him
through
various
twists
and
turns
of
the
under
city
among
the
huts
and
storehouses
thronged
with
silent
people
it
was
like
moving
in
the
interior
of
a
hive
of
bees
until
by
means
of
an
archway
and
a
closed
door
we
emerged
in
a
sort
of
courtyard
surrounded
on
three
sides
by
buildings
on
the
fourth
was
a
rail
and
above
and
around
was
open
night
we
ca
take
his
body
to
china
said
our
guide
we
must
burn
it
here
and
only
the
ashes
will
rest
in
the
village
of
his
ancestors
but
it
is
well
such
cases
are
provided
for
in
my
religion
we
then
saw
that
in
the
center
of
the
yard
there
was
a
low
funeral
pile
apparently
of
wood
two
men
in
long
yellow
gowns
were
pouring
some
liquid
over
it
if
you
will
do
me
the
honor
to
come
this
way
said
and
we
entered
a
long
bare
room
in
the
center
of
this
place
there
was
a
large
square
box
of
painted
wood
the
lid
of
which
was
not
yet
in
place
the
body
of
the
dead
man
was
sitting
in
the
box
the
hands
clasped
round
the
knees
the
nose
ears
and
mouth
were
filled
with
vermilion
which
to
our
western
eyes
gave
a
horrible
grotesque
appearance
to
the
brown
wrinkled
mask
of
the
face
poor
sen
countenance
was
placid
enough
but
it
was
not
like
that
of
even
a
dead
man
a
fantastic
image
rather
a
gong
beat
with
a
sudden
hollow
reverberation
and
from
another
door
a
file
of
mourners
entered
at
the
far
end
of
the
room
was
a
table
upon
which
was
a
painted
tablet
it
bears
whispered
the
name
under
which
sen
enters
salvation
two
men
swinging
censers
stood
by
the
table
and
two
others
a
little
nearer
the
corpse
held
bronze
bowls
of
water
first
and
then
the
other
mourners
dipped
their
hands
in
the
water
to
purify
them
and
then
producing
paper
packets
of
incense
from
their
bosoms
they
threw
a
pinch
into
the
censers
with
the
right
hand
and
bowed
low
to
the
table
retiring
backwards
it
was
all
done
with
the
precision
of
a
drill
and
in
absolute
silence
and
for
my
part
i
found
it
no
less
ghastly
and
unreal
than
the
brutal
scene
in
the
below
come
out
i
whispered
to
rolston
and
we
reëntered
the
pure
air
walking
to
the
rail
at
one
side
of
the
square
we
leant
over
far
far
below
so
far
that
it
was
sensation
rather
than
vision
was
a
faint
full
glow
the
night
lights
of
london
but
of
the
city
itself
nothing
could
be
seen
whatever
even
the
burnished
ribbon
of
the
thames
had
disappeared
and
no
sound
rose
from
the
capital
of
the
world
there
was
a
thin
whispering
round
us
as
the
night
breezes
blew
through
steel
stay
and
cantilever
a
faint
humming
noise
like
that
of
some
gigantic
æolian
harp
and
once
as
we
bathed
ourselves
in
the
cool
the
immensity
and
the
dark
there
was
a
rush
of
whirring
wings
and
the
of
the
wild
duck
from
the
great
lake
fifteen
hundred
feet
below
as
they
passed
in
flight
on
some
mysterious
night
errand
we
leant
and
gazed
filled
with
awe
and
solemnity
until
a
low
wailing
chant
and
the
thin
piercing
notes
of
violins
made
us
turn
to
see
the
square
box
hoisted
on
the
bier
a
torch
applied
and
a
roaring
spitting
column
of
yellow
flame
towering
up
above
the
buildings
and
throwing
a
ghastly
light
on
a
hundred
round
faces
indistinguishable
one
from
the
other
by
european
eyes
as
i
read
now
ten
years
afterwards
that
scene
among
so
many
others
comes
back
to
me
with
extraordinary
vividness
and
it
seems
to
me
as
i
live
my
english
life
in
honor
tranquillity
and
happiness
that
it
was
all
a
monstrous
dream
surely
yes
i
think
i
am
safe
in
saying
this
there
will
never
again
be
such
a
place
of
horror
and
fantasy
as
the
city
in
the
clouds
chapter
fourteen
i
slept
that
night
like
a
log
untroubled
by
dreams
and
woke
late
the
next
morning
it
was
then
that
as
the
saying
is
i
got
it
in
the
neck
wow
i
as
i
turned
to
meet
the
chinese
valet
with
the
morning
cup
of
tea
my
whole
body
seemed
one
bruise
my
joints
turned
to
pith
and
what
was
worse
than
all
my
brain
a
pretty
active
organ
take
it
all
in
all
seemed
stuffed
with
wool
it
was
the
reaction
only
to
be
expected
as
the
richmond
doctor
said
to
me
some
three
hours
later
for
the
next
two
or
three
days
i
was
to
do
nothing
at
all
after
my
bad
fall
which
was
the
way
my
state
had
been
explained
to
him
whether
he
believed
it
or
not
i
can
not
tell
it
was
certainly
odd
that
mendoza
morse
whom
he
also
attended
should
be
in
very
much
the
same
state
of
shock
and
but
he
was
a
discreet
gentleman
with
a
comfortable
manner
and
in
the
seventh
heaven
at
being
admitted
to
the
mysterious
city
in
the
clouds
his
eyes
everywhere
as
he
was
being
conducted
through
its
wonders
to
our
bedsides
so
rolston
told
me
afterwards
at
any
rate
he
was
right
it
was
certainly
necessary
to
go
slow
for
a
few
days
and
fortunately
now
that
the
search
was
over
and
no
trace
of
midwinter
discovered
we
felt
we
could
do
this
the
preliminary
arrangements
for
our
final
effort
were
left
in
hands
who
descended
with
the
doctor
and
i
did
not
rise
till
i
met
morse
at
lunch
and
distinctly
under
the
weather
from
a
physical
point
of
view
we
neither
of
us
talked
of
important
matters
but
enjoyed
a
stroll
round
the
city
during
a
bright
afternoon
at
we
met
juanita
and
i
had
a
long
and
happy
talk
with
her
she
knew
of
course
that
the
search
had
proved
satisfactory
and
as
we
had
all
agreed
together
i
led
her
to
think
that
all
danger
was
now
practically
over
indeed
as
far
as
morse
and
she
were
concerned
i
believed
it
myself
i
knew
that
there
was
yet
a
grim
tussle
ahead
for
the
rest
of
us
but
that
was
all
i
did
not
see
her
at
dinner
but
took
the
meal
alone
in
my
own
house
rolston
was
still
absent
and
as
i
did
not
want
to
talk
to
any
one
failing
juanita
i
was
quite
happy
by
myself
about
nine
i
was
rung
up
on
the
telephone
morse
spoke
he
said
he
was
now
thoroughly
rested
and
was
ready
for
a
chat
if
i
had
seen
the
treasures
of
the
library
yet
he
and
would
be
pleased
to
show
them
to
me
and
so
slipping
on
a
coat
over
my
evening
clothes
and
taking
a
light
cane
in
my
hand
i
started
out
for
grand
square
it
was
again
i
may
mention
here
a
fine
and
calm
night
my
host
and
the
chinaman
were
waiting
for
me
in
the
great
gothic
room
and
we
inspected
the
treasures
in
some
of
the
shelves
i
was
surprised
and
delighted
to
find
that
my
future
had
a
real
love
for
and
a
considerable
knowledge
of
books
it
was
a
side
of
him
i
had
not
seen
before
i
had
not
connected
him
with
the
arts
in
any
way
which
when
you
come
to
think
of
it
was
rather
foolish
certainly
he
had
the
finest
expert
advice
and
help
to
be
found
in
the
whole
world
in
the
building
of
the
city
in
the
clouds
but
i
should
have
remembered
that
the
initial
conception
was
his
own
and
that
many
of
the
details
also
came
entirely
from
his
brain
certainly
in
his
way
mendoza
morse
was
a
creative
artist
my
own
collection
of
books
at
stax
my
place
in
hertfordshire
is
of
course
well
known
and
always
mentioned
when
english
libraries
are
under
discussion
but
morse
could
boast
treasures
far
beyond
me
during
the
last
year
or
two
i
had
been
so
busy
in
working
up
the
that
i
had
quite
neglected
to
follow
the
book
sales
but
i
learned
now
that
some
of
the
rarest
treasures
obtainable
had
been
quietly
bought
up
on
morse
behalf
he
had
all
the
folios
and
most
of
the
quartos
of
shakespeare
a
fine
edition
of
spenser
faërie
queene
with
an
inscription
to
florio
the
great
elizabethan
scholar
there
was
boswell
own
copy
of
johnson
lives
of
the
poets
with
a
ponderous
latin
inscription
in
the
sturdy
old
doctor
own
hand
and
many
other
treasures
as
rare
though
not
perhaps
of
such
popular
and
general
interest
made
us
some
marvelous
tea
in
the
chinese
fashion
with
a
sort
of
ritual
which
was
impressive
as
he
moved
about
the
table
and
waved
his
long
pale
hands
it
was
of
a
faint
straw
color
with
neither
sugar
milk
or
lemon
and
he
assured
me
that
it
came
from
the
stores
of
the
forbidden
city
in
pekin
certainly
it
was
nasty
enough
for
anything
and
i
praised
it
as
i
had
praised
morse
champagne
the
night
before
but
with
less
sincerity
i
do
know
if
my
friend
had
a
touch
of
homesickness
or
not
but
he
began
to
tell
us
of
his
home
by
the
waters
of
the
his
precise
and
literary
english
rose
and
fell
in
that
great
room
with
a
singular
charm
and
though
i
do
think
morse
listened
much
he
smoked
a
cigar
with
great
while
expounded
his
quaint
eastern
philosophy
we
did
not
refer
to
the
grim
scenes
of
the
night
before
but
something
i
said
turned
the
conversation
to
the
funeral
customs
of
china
indeed
sir
thomas
said
the
death
of
a
man
of
my
nation
may
be
said
to
be
the
most
important
act
of
his
whole
life
for
then
only
can
his
personal
existence
be
properly
considered
to
begin
this
seemed
a
somewhat
startling
proposition
and
i
said
so
but
he
proceeded
to
explain
i
shall
not
easily
forget
his
little
monologue
every
word
of
which
i
remember
for
a
very
sad
and
poignant
reason
well
he
knows
all
about
it
now
and
i
hope
he
is
happy
it
is
in
this
way
he
said
by
death
a
man
joins
the
great
company
of
ancestors
who
are
to
us
people
of
almost
more
consequence
than
living
folk
and
of
much
more
individual
distinction
it
is
then
at
last
he
continued
delicately
sipping
his
tea
that
the
individual
receives
that
recognition
which
was
denied
him
in
the
flesh
our
ancestors
are
given
a
dwelling
of
their
own
and
devotedly
reverenced
this
i
know
will
seem
strange
to
western
ears
but
believe
me
honorable
sir
the
cult
is
anything
but
funereal
for
the
ancestral
tombs
are
temples
and
pleasure
pavilions
at
the
same
time
consecrated
not
simply
to
rites
and
ceremonies
but
to
family
gatherings
and
general
jollification
this
was
quite
a
new
view
to
me
and
certainly
interesting
i
said
so
and
smiled
and
bowed
and
the
fortunate
defunct
he
went
on
if
he
is
still
half
as
sentient
as
his
dutiful
descendants
suppose
must
feel
that
his
earthly
life
like
other
approved
comedies
has
ended
well
his
voice
was
sad
but
there
was
a
faint
malicious
mockery
in
it
also
and
as
i
looked
at
him
with
an
answering
smile
to
his
own
i
wondered
whether
that
keen
and
subtle
brain
really
believed
in
the
customs
of
his
land
that
he
would
be
studious
and
rigid
in
their
outward
observance
i
knew
i
never
met
as
i
have
said
before
a
more
courteous
gentleman
than
ever
been
in
south
germany
said
morse
suddenly
he
had
evidently
been
pursuing
a
train
of
his
own
thought
while
the
chinaman
held
forth
yes
morse
why
then
in
some
of
those
quaint
towns
you
have
seen
the
storks
nesting
on
the
roofs
of
the
houses
i
remembered
that
i
had
well
i
got
a
pair
of
storks
they
arrived
this
morning
from
germany
duck
and
drake
or
should
you
say
cock
and
hen
at
any
rate
i
a
sort
of
idea
of
trying
to
domesticate
them
and
to
that
end
have
had
a
nest
constructed
on
the
roof
of
this
building
where
they
will
be
sheltered
by
the
parapet
and
be
high
up
above
the
roof
of
the
city
what
do
you
say
to
going
to
have
a
look
at
them
and
see
if
they
all
right
extraordinary
man
he
had
always
some
odd
or
curious
idea
in
his
mind
to
improve
his
artificial
fairyland
nothing
loth
we
left
and
ascended
a
winding
staircase
to
the
roof
of
the
great
building
save
for
the
lantern
in
the
center
it
was
flat
and
made
a
not
unpleasant
promenade
the
storks
were
at
present
in
a
cage
and
could
only
be
distinguished
as
bundles
of
dirty
feathers
in
a
miscellaneous
litter
i
thought
my
friend
chance
of
domesticating
them
was
very
small
but
he
seemed
to
be
immensely
interested
in
the
problem
when
we
had
talked
it
over
he
gave
me
a
cigar
and
we
began
to
promenade
the
whole
length
of
the
roof
as
i
have
said
the
night
was
clear
and
calm
again
the
great
stars
globed
themselves
in
heaven
with
an
incomparable
glory
unknown
and
unsuspected
by
those
down
below
the
silence
was
profound
the
air
like
iced
wine
from
where
we
were
we
had
a
view
of
the
whole
city
grand
square
lay
immediately
at
our
feet
brilliantly
illuminated
as
usual
not
a
living
soul
was
to
be
seen
only
the
glittered
with
mysterious
life
to
the
right
beyond
the
encircling
buildings
of
the
square
stood
the
palacete
mendoza
surrounded
by
its
gardens
a
square
white
sleeping
pile
i
sent
a
mental
greeting
to
juanita
so
high
was
the
roof
on
which
we
stood
that
only
one
of
the
towers
or
cupolas
rose
much
above
us
it
was
the
dome
of
the
observatory
exactly
opposite
on
the
other
side
of
grand
square
there
is
some
one
who
is
much
troubled
by
affairs
i
said
pointing
over
the
morse
nodded
and
expelled
a
blue
cloud
of
smoke
i
guess
old
chang
is
the
most
contented
fellow
on
earth
he
said
he
is
professor
you
know
professor
chang
and
an
honorary
of
oxford
university
i
had
him
from
the
imperial
chinese
observatory
at
pekin
and
i
am
told
he
is
on
the
track
of
a
new
comet
or
something
which
is
to
be
called
after
me
when
he
has
discovered
it
thus
conferring
immortality
upon
yours
truly
it
is
an
odd
temper
of
mind
he
went
on
more
seriously
that
can
spend
a
whole
life
in
patient
seclusion
peering
into
the
unknown
and
what
after
all
is
the
unknowable
still
he
is
happy
and
that
is
the
end
of
human
endeavor
he
sighed
and
with
renewed
interest
i
stared
out
at
the
round
dome
the
slit
over
the
telescope
was
open
which
showed
that
the
astronomer
was
at
work
in
the
gilded
of
the
cupola
it
was
exactly
like
a
cut
in
an
orange
i
was
about
to
make
a
remark
when
an
extraordinary
thing
happened
without
any
hint
or
warning
there
was
a
loud
roaring
sound
like
that
of
some
engine
blowing
off
steam
with
a
whoosh
a
great
column
of
fire
like
golden
rain
rose
up
out
of
the
dark
aperture
in
the
dome
towering
hundreds
of
feet
in
the
sky
like
the
veritable
comet
for
which
old
chang
was
searching
and
burst
high
in
the
empyrean
with
a
dull
explosion
followed
by
a
swarm
of
brilliant
stars
some
one
inside
the
observatory
had
fired
a
gigantic
rocket
morse
gave
a
shout
of
surprise
he
had
a
fresh
cigar
in
his
hand
and
unknowingly
he
dropped
it
and
mechanically
bit
the
end
of
his
thumb
instead
what
was
that
i
cried
echoing
his
shout
he
did
answer
but
grew
very
white
as
he
stepped
up
to
the
parapet
placed
his
hand
upon
the
stone
and
leant
forward
i
did
the
same
and
for
nearly
a
minute
we
stared
at
the
white
circular
tower
in
silence
nothing
happened
there
was
the
black
slit
in
the
gold
enigmatic
and
undisturbed
some
experiment
i
stammered
at
length
professor
chang
is
at
work
upon
some
problem
morse
shook
his
head
not
he
i
swear
that
old
chang
would
never
be
letting
off
fireworks
without
consulting
or
warning
kirby
there
is
some
black
business
stirring
we
must
look
into
this
i
do
like
it
at
all
hark
he
suddenly
stopped
speaking
and
put
his
hand
to
his
ear
his
whole
face
was
strained
in
an
ecstasy
of
listening
which
cut
deep
gashes
into
that
stern
gnarled
old
countenance
i
listened
also
and
with
dread
in
my
heart
instinctively
and
without
any
process
of
reasoning
i
knew
that
in
some
way
or
other
the
horror
was
upon
us
again
my
lips
went
dry
and
i
moistened
them
with
the
tip
of
my
tongue
and
without
conscious
thought
my
hand
stole
round
to
my
pistol
pocket
and
touched
the
cold
and
roughened
stock
of
an
automatic
webley
then
i
heard
what
morse
must
have
heard
at
first
the
air
all
around
us
was
vibrating
and
swiftly
the
vibration
became
a
throb
a
rhythmic
beat
and
then
a
low
menacing
roar
which
grew
louder
and
louder
every
second
we
had
turned
to
each
other
understanding
at
last
and
the
same
word
was
upon
our
lips
when
the
thing
came
it
happened
as
rapidly
as
that
skimming
over
the
top
of
the
distant
palacete
like
some
huge
and
with
a
noise
like
a
machine
gun
came
a
monoplane
it
swept
down
into
grand
square
like
a
living
thing
just
as
the
noise
ceased
suddenly
and
echoed
into
silence
it
alighted
at
one
end
and
on
the
side
of
the
fountain
nearest
the
observatory
ran
over
the
smooth
for
a
few
yards
and
stopped
it
was
as
though
the
hawk
had
pounced
down
upon
its
prey
and
every
detail
was
distinct
and
clear
in
the
brilliant
light
of
the
lamps
in
the
square
below
both
of
us
seemed
frozen
where
we
stood
i
know
for
my
part
all
power
of
motion
left
me
a
choking
noise
came
from
morse
throat
and
then
we
heard
a
cry
and
from
immediately
below
us
came
the
figure
of
hurrying
down
the
library
steps
and
running
towards
the
aeroplane
which
was
still
a
considerable
distance
from
him
the
next
thing
happened
very
quickly
a
door
at
the
foot
of
the
observatory
tower
opened
and
out
came
what
we
both
thought
was
the
figure
of
the
astronomer
he
was
a
tall
bent
old
man
habitually
clothed
in
a
padded
robe
with
a
hood
something
like
that
of
a
monk
chang
i
said
in
a
hoarse
whisper
when
stopped
short
in
his
tracks
lifted
his
arm
and
there
was
the
crack
of
a
pistol
the
figure
beyond
which
was
hurrying
towards
the
monoplane
swerved
aside
the
robe
of
padded
silk
fell
from
it
and
disclosed
a
tall
man
in
dark
european
clothes
he
dodged
and
writhed
like
an
eel
as
emptied
his
automatic
at
him
apparently
without
the
least
result
then
i
saw
that
he
was
at
the
side
of
the
aeroplane
scrambling
up
into
the
fuselage
assisted
by
the
pilot
in
leather
hood
and
goggles
he
was
up
the
side
of
the
structure
in
a
second
and
then
with
one
leg
thrown
over
the
car
he
turned
and
took
deliberate
aim
at
there
was
one
crack
he
waited
for
an
instant
to
be
sure
and
saw
that
it
was
enough
then
there
was
a
chunk
of
machinery
two
or
three
loud
explosions
a
roar
and
the
wings
of
the
venomous
moved
rapidly
over
the
parquet
chased
by
a
black
shadow
it
gathered
speed
lifted
tilted
upwards
and
clearing
the
buildings
at
the
far
end
of
the
square
hummed
away
into
the
night
it
was
thus
that
mark
antony
midwinter
escaped
from
the
city
in
the
clouds
he
had
been
there
all
the
time
he
had
murdered
poor
old
chang
many
hours
before
and
impersonated
him
with
complete
success
the
food
of
the
recluse
was
brought
to
him
by
servants
and
placed
in
an
outer
room
so
that
he
should
never
be
disturbed
during
his
calculations
he
had
received
it
with
his
usual
muttered
acknowledgments
through
a
little
in
the
wooden
partition
which
separated
the
anteroom
from
the
telescope
chamber
itself
no
one
had
ever
thought
of
doubting
that
the
astronomer
himself
was
there
as
usual
the
whole
thing
was
most
carefully
planned
beforehand
with
diabolic
ingenuity
and
resource
chapter
fifteen
it
was
just
three
weeks
after
the
murder
of
and
once
more
i
sat
in
my
chambers
in
piccadilly
the
day
had
been
cloudy
and
now
late
in
the
afternoon
a
heavy
fog
had
descended
upon
the
town
through
which
fell
a
cold
and
intermittent
rain
up
there
in
the
city
in
the
clouds
perhaps
the
sun
was
pouring
down
upon
its
spires
and
cupolas
but
london
piccadilly
was
lowering
and
sad
lord
arthur
winstanley
and
captain
pat
moore
had
just
left
me
both
of
them
glum
and
silent
it
went
to
my
heart
not
to
take
them
into
my
full
confidence
but
to
do
so
was
impossible
i
had
told
them
much
of
the
recent
events
in
the
city
i
could
not
tell
them
everything
for
they
would
not
have
understood
certainly
i
could
have
relied
upon
their
absolute
discretion
but
in
view
of
what
was
going
to
happen
that
very
night
i
was
compelled
to
keep
my
own
counsel
they
had
not
lived
through
what
i
had
recently
their
minds
were
not
tuned
as
mine
was
to
the
sublime
disregard
and
aloofness
from
english
law
which
obtained
in
morse
gigantic
refuge
certainly
neither
of
them
would
have
agreed
to
what
i
proposed
to
do
that
night
preston
came
quietly
into
the
library
he
pulled
the
curtains
and
made
up
the
fire
the
face
of
preston
was
grim
and
disapproving
he
looked
much
as
he
looked
when
what
ages
ago
it
seemed
i
departed
his
comfortable
care
to
become
the
landlord
of
the
golden
swan
i
not
at
home
to
any
one
preston
i
said
except
to
sliddim
who
ought
to
be
here
in
a
few
minutes
of
course
that
does
apply
to
mr
rolston
very
good
sir
thomas
thank
you
sir
thomas
said
preston
scowling
at
the
mention
of
the
name
poor
fellow
he
did
in
the
least
understand
why
i
should
be
receiving
the
furtive
and
melancholy
sliddim
so
often
and
should
sit
with
him
in
conference
for
long
hours
afterwards
when
it
was
all
over
i
interrogated
my
faithful
servant
and
the
state
of
his
mind
during
that
period
proved
to
have
been
startling
this
seems
the
place
in
which
to
explain
exactly
what
had
happened
up
to
date
when
midwinter
had
escaped
we
found
the
corpse
of
poor
old
professor
chang
and
the
whole
plan
was
revealed
to
us
had
been
shot
through
the
heart
his
death
must
have
been
instantaneous
for
several
days
morse
was
in
a
terrible
state
of
depression
and
remorse
he
said
that
there
was
a
curse
upon
him
and
it
was
with
the
greatest
difficulty
that
rolston
and
i
could
bring
him
into
a
more
reasonable
frame
of
mind
the
long
strain
had
worn
down
even
that
iron
resolution
but
for
juanita
sake
i
knew
that
i
must
stand
by
him
to
the
end
accordingly
there
was
nothing
else
for
it
rolston
and
i
took
entire
charge
of
everything
i
had
never
felt
inclined
to
go
back
from
the
very
beginning
now
my
resolution
was
firm
to
see
it
through
to
the
end
rolston
pursued
his
own
plans
and
london
very
shortly
knew
that
gideon
mendoza
morse
and
his
lovely
daughter
were
about
to
reappear
in
the
world
it
gave
my
little
friend
intense
pleasure
to
organize
this
mild
press
campaign
from
the
office
of
the
i
placed
him
in
complete
control
to
the
intense
joy
of
miss
dewsbury
and
the
disgust
of
the
older
members
of
the
staff
be
that
as
it
may
the
thing
was
done
and
every
one
knew
that
birmingham
house
had
been
taken
by
the
millionaire
it
was
then
having
organized
things
as
perfectly
as
i
could
at
the
city
placing
the
gigantic
of
the
ground
inclosure
in
charge
of
the
staff
that
i
myself
descended
into
the
world
as
unobtrusively
as
possible
for
a
day
or
two
i
remained
in
seclusion
at
the
golden
swan
and
during
those
two
days
saw
no
one
but
the
honest
fool
abbs
my
housekeeper
and
sliddim
the
private
inquiry
agent
personally
while
i
quite
appreciated
the
fellow
skill
in
his
own
dirty
work
and
while
indeed
i
owed
him
a
considerable
debt
in
the
matter
of
bill
rolston
first
disappearance
i
disliked
him
too
much
ever
to
have
thought
of
him
as
a
help
in
the
very
serious
affair
on
which
i
was
engaged
it
was
rolston
as
usual
who
changed
my
mind
he
saw
farther
than
i
did
he
realized
the
essential
secrecy
and
fidelity
of
the
odd
creature
whom
chance
had
unearthed
from
among
the
creeping
things
of
london
and
in
the
end
he
became
an
integral
part
of
the
plot
he
was
told
of
course
no
more
than
was
necessary
he
was
not
by
any
means
in
our
full
confidence
but
he
was
given
a
part
to
play
and
promised
a
reward
if
he
played
it
well
that
would
make
him
independent
for
life
let
me
say
at
once
that
he
fulfilled
his
duty
with
admirable
skill
and
when
he
received
his
check
from
morse
vanished
forever
from
our
ken
i
have
no
doubt
that
he
is
spying
somewhere
or
other
on
the
globe
at
this
moment
but
i
have
no
ambition
to
meet
him
again
sliddim
considerably
furbished
up
in
personal
appearance
was
made
caretaker
at
birmingham
house
in
berkeley
square
he
had
not
been
in
that
responsible
position
for
more
than
ten
days
when
our
fish
began
to
nibble
at
the
bait
in
a
certain
little
public
house
by
some
mews
at
the
back
of
berkeley
square
a
little
public
house
which
sliddim
was
instructed
and
needed
no
encouragement
to
frequent
he
was
one
day
accosted
by
a
tall
man
with
a
full
handsome
face
and
a
head
of
curling
gray
hair
this
man
was
dressed
in
a
seedy
style
and
soon
became
intimate
with
our
lure
certainly
to
give
him
his
due
sliddim
must
have
been
a
supreme
actor
in
his
way
he
did
the
honest
but
intensely
stupid
caretaker
to
the
life
mark
antony
midwinter
was
completely
taken
in
and
pumped
our
human
conduit
for
all
he
was
worth
until
he
was
put
in
possession
of
an
entirely
fictitious
set
of
circumstances
arranged
with
the
greatest
care
to
suit
my
plans
i
shall
not
easily
forget
the
evening
when
sliddim
slunk
into
my
and
described
the
scene
which
told
us
we
had
made
absolutely
no
mistake
and
that
our
fish
was
definitely
hooked
it
seems
that
the
good
sliddim
had
gradually
succumbed
to
the
repeated
proffer
of
strong
waters
on
the
part
of
smith
his
new
friend
he
had
bragged
of
his
position
only
lamenting
that
some
days
hence
it
was
to
come
to
an
end
when
in
the
evening
mendoza
morse
his
daughter
and
a
staff
of
servants
were
to
enter
the
house
simultaneously
sliddim
the
most
consistent
i
have
ever
seen
and
i
had
some
curious
on
that
question
when
i
was
landlord
of
the
golden
swan
was
physically
almost
incapable
of
drunkenness
but
he
simulated
it
so
well
in
the
little
pub
at
the
back
of
the
square
that
mark
antony
midwinter
made
no
ado
about
taking
the
latchkey
of
birmingham
house
area
door
from
his
pocket
and
making
a
waxen
impression
of
it
rolston
and
i
knew
that
we
were
getting
very
hot
as
the
children
say
when
they
are
playing
and
another
visit
from
sliddim
confirmed
it
the
plan
of
our
enemy
was
perfectly
clear
to
our
minds
he
would
enter
the
house
by
means
of
the
key
an
hour
or
two
before
morse
and
the
servants
were
due
conceal
himself
within
it
and
do
what
he
had
to
do
in
the
silent
hours
of
the
night
it
was
quite
certain
that
he
believed
morse
now
felt
himself
secure
and
no
doubt
midwinter
had
arranged
a
plan
for
his
escape
from
berkeley
square
when
his
vengeance
was
complete
as
ingenious
and
thoroughgoing
as
that
prepared
for
his
literal
flight
from
the
city
in
the
clouds
and
now
on
this
very
evening
i
was
to
throw
the
dice
in
a
desperate
game
with
this
human
tiger
it
is
for
certain
sir
said
sliddim
when
he
arrived
let
him
know
that
i
am
leaving
the
house
for
a
couple
of
hours
this
evening
between
eight
and
ten
to
see
my
old
mother
in
camden
town
at
eleven
he
supposes
that
the
servants
are
arriving
and
at
midnight
and
miss
morse
a
professional
friend
of
mine
is
watching
our
gent
very
carefully
he
is
at
present
staying
at
a
small
private
hotel
in
soho
and
i
should
think
you
had
better
come
to
the
house
about
seven
on
foot
and
directly
you
ring
i
let
you
in
i
promised
to
meet
our
friend
at
the
little
public
house
in
the
mews
at
eight
for
just
one
drink
he
wants
to
be
certain
that
i
am
really
out
of
the
way
and
i
should
say
that
he
would
be
inside
birmingham
house
within
a
quarter
of
an
hour
afterwards
rolston
came
in
before
the
fellow
went
and
a
few
more
details
were
discussed
which
brought
the
time
up
to
about
six
and
then
i
had
a
most
unpleasant
and
difficult
few
minutes
my
faithful
little
lieutenant
defied
me
for
the
first
time
since
i
had
known
him
i
ca
tell
what
time
i
shall
be
back
i
said
but
i
shall
want
you
to
be
at
the
end
of
the
telephone
wire
there
are
plenty
of
telephones
in
birmingham
house
but
i
am
going
too
sir
thomas
he
said
quickly
i
shook
my
head
no
i
said
i
must
go
through
this
alone
but
it
impossible
you
must
have
some
one
to
help
you
sir
thomas
it
is
madness
to
meet
that
devil
alone
in
an
empty
house
it
absolutely
unnecessary
too
i
go
with
you
i
owe
him
one
for
the
blow
he
gave
me
when
he
escaped
from
the
at
the
city
and
besides
bill
rolston
i
said
the
essence
of
fidelity
is
to
obey
orders
i
owe
more
to
you
than
i
can
possibly
say
without
you
i
dread
to
think
what
might
have
happened
to
miss
morse
and
her
father
but
on
this
occasion
i
am
adamant
you
will
be
far
more
use
to
me
waiting
here
ready
to
carry
out
any
instructions
that
may
come
over
the
wire
please
sir
thomas
if
i
ever
done
anything
as
you
say
let
me
come
with
you
his
voice
broke
in
a
sob
of
entreaty
but
i
steeled
myself
and
refused
him
i
must
say
he
took
it
very
well
when
he
saw
that
there
was
no
further
chance
of
moving
me
very
well
then
sir
thomas
he
said
if
it
must
be
so
it
must
be
i
will
be
back
here
at
seven
and
wait
all
night
if
necessary
with
that
his
face
clouded
with
gloom
he
went
away
and
i
was
left
alone
doubtless
you
will
have
gathered
my
motive
it
would
have
been
criminal
to
let
rolston
or
any
one
else
have
a
share
in
this
last
adventure
to
put
it
in
plain
english
i
determined
at
whatever
risk
to
myself
to
kill
mark
antony
midwinter
there
was
nothing
else
for
it
the
law
could
not
be
invoked
while
he
lived
my
girl
life
would
be
in
terrible
danger
the
man
had
to
be
destroyed
as
one
would
destroy
a
mad
dog
and
it
was
my
duty
and
mine
alone
to
destroy
him
if
i
came
off
worst
in
the
encounter
well
morse
still
had
skilled
defenders
the
risk
i
knew
was
considerable
but
it
seemed
that
i
held
the
winning
cards
for
within
two
hours
midwinter
would
step
into
a
trap
when
i
had
killed
him
i
had
my
own
plans
as
to
the
disposal
of
the
body
it
was
arranged
that
a
considerable
number
of
chinese
servants
from
the
city
should
arrive
at
eleven
if
i
knew
those
bland
yellow
ruffians
it
would
not
be
a
difficult
thing
to
dispose
of
midwinter
remains
either
on
the
spot
or
by
conveyal
to
richmond
another
alternative
was
that
i
should
shoot
him
in
as
an
ordinary
burglar
certainly
the
law
would
come
in
here
but
it
would
be
justifiable
homicide
and
be
merely
a
three
days
sensation
i
had
to
catch
my
hare
first
the
method
of
cooking
it
could
be
left
till
afterwards
in
a
drawer
in
my
were
letters
to
various
people
including
my
solicitor
and
my
two
friends
pat
moore
and
arthur
winstanley
there
was
a
long
one
also
to
juanita
everything
was
arranged
and
in
order
i
am
not
aware
that
i
felt
any
fear
or
any
particular
emotion
save
one
of
deep
abiding
purpose
nothing
would
now
have
turned
me
from
what
i
proposed
to
do
i
had
spent
long
thought
over
it
and
i
was
perfectly
convinced
that
it
was
an
act
of
justice
irregular
dangerous
to
myself
but
morally
defendable
by
every
canon
of
equity
and
right
the
man
was
a
murderer
over
and
over
again
he
would
receive
the
honor
of
a
private
execution
that
was
all
when
i
left
my
chambers
with
an
automatic
pistol
a
case
of
sandwiches
and
a
flask
of
the
rain
was
descending
in
a
torrent
the
street
was
empty
and
dismal
and
berkeley
square
itself
a
desert
i
do
think
i
saw
a
single
person
except
one
in
oilskins
sheltering
under
an
archway
till
i
arrived
at
birmingham
house
the
façade
of
the
mansion
was
blank
and
cheerless
all
the
blinds
were
down
there
was
not
a
sign
of
occupation
i
rang
the
door
opened
immediately
and
i
slipped
in
i
must
be
off
sir
thomas
said
sliddim
if
you
go
through
the
door
on
the
far
side
of
the
inner
hall
beyond
the
grand
staircase
you
will
find
yourself
in
a
short
passage
with
a
baize
door
at
the
farther
end
push
this
open
and
you
will
be
in
a
small
lobby
the
door
immediately
to
your
left
is
that
of
the
butler
pantry
it
commands
the
service
stairs
and
lift
to
the
kitchen
and
servants
rooms
standing
in
the
doorway
you
will
see
the
head
of
any
one
coming
up
the
stairs
and
he
gave
a
sickly
grin
and
something
approaching
a
reptilian
wink
sliddim
was
an
unpleasant
person
and
i
never
liked
him
less
than
at
that
moment
with
another
whisper
he
opened
the
door
a
few
inches
and
writhed
out
i
was
left
alone
in
birmingham
house
it
was
the
queerest
possible
sensation
and
as
i
crossed
the
great
inner
hall
with
its
tapestries
and
gleaming
statuary
lit
now
by
two
single
electric
bulbs
i
do
deny
that
my
heart
was
beating
a
good
deal
faster
than
was
pleasant
there
is
always
something
ghostly
about
an
empty
house
more
especially
when
it
is
fully
furnished
and
ready
for
occupation
the
absence
of
all
life
is
uncanny
and
one
seems
to
feel
that
it
is
hidden
not
absent
and
that
at
any
moment
a
door
may
open
and
some
enigmatic
stranger
be
standing
there
with
an
unpleasant
welcome
in
his
eyes
well
i
slunk
through
all
the
glories
of
the
grand
hall
passed
down
the
passage
and
came
out
into
the
servants
quarters
the
little
lobby
the
floor
of
which
was
covered
with
cork
matting
was
well
lit
and
so
were
the
stairs
i
peered
over
the
rail
but
could
not
see
to
the
bottom
but
standing
in
the
door
of
the
room
called
the
butler
pantry
i
saw
that
i
could
put
a
bullet
through
the
head
of
any
one
appearing
before
he
could
have
the
slightest
inkling
of
my
presence
before
he
could
slew
round
even
to
face
me
the
butler
pantry
itself
was
a
comfortable
room
with
a
carpet
on
the
floor
and
a
couple
of
worn
padded
armchairs
by
the
fireplace
the
walls
were
hung
with
photographs
on
one
side
was
a
desk
and
in
a
corner
a
large
safe
which
obviously
contained
the
plate
in
daily
use
in
the
great
household
i
knew
that
the
bulk
of
the
valuables
were
stored
in
a
strong
room
in
chancery
lane
upon
the
table
sliddim
had
thoughtfully
placed
a
heavy
decanter
half
full
of
whisky
a
siphon
and
the
whisky
was
all
right
but
did
he
expect
me
to
hobnob
with
antony
midwinter
to
speed
the
parting
guest
as
it
were
with
a
it
was
difficult
to
suspect
him
of
such
grim
humor
i
looked
at
my
watch
there
was
still
a
good
before
midwinter
and
sliddim
were
due
to
meet
in
the
little
public
house
behind
the
square
i
saw
that
my
pistol
was
handy
and
sat
down
in
one
of
the
armchairs
by
the
fireside
a
pipe
of
the
incomparable
john
cotton
would
not
be
amiss
i
thought
wondering
if
i
should
ever
taste
its
fragrance
again
and
for
some
minutes
i
sat
and
smoked
placidly
enough
then
i
suppose
a
quarter
of
an
hour
or
so
must
have
elapsed
i
began
to
fidget
in
my
chair
the
house
was
so
terribly
still
still
but
not
quite
silent
time
that
was
ticking
away
so
rapidly
had
a
score
of
small
voices
there
was
the
faint
noise
of
taxicabs
out
in
the
square
the
drip
of
the
rain
an
occasional
stealthy
creak
from
the
furniture
the
scurry
of
a
mouse
in
the
wainscot
the
more
remote
chambers
of
my
brain
began
to
fill
with
riot
and
once
my
nerves
jerked
like
a
hooked
fish
and
even
now
i
do
not
think
it
was
fear
terror
perhaps
there
is
a
subtle
distinction
but
not
craven
fear
i
think
perhaps
it
was
more
the
sense
of
something
coldly
evil
that
might
even
now
be
approaching
through
the
fog
and
rain
a
lost
soul
inspired
with
cunning
hatred
and
ferocity
whom
i
must
meet
in
deadly
contact
within
a
short
but
unknown
space
of
time
this
wo
do
at
all
i
thought
and
then
my
eye
fell
on
hospitable
preparations
i
got
up
went
round
to
the
other
side
of
the
table
put
my
pistol
down
upon
it
and
mixed
a
stiff
peg
my
back
was
now
to
the
open
door
and
i
was
just
lifting
the
glass
to
my
lips
eagerly
enough
i
am
afraid
when
very
softly
something
descended
upon
each
of
my
shoulders
i
had
not
heard
a
sound
of
any
sort
save
the
gurgle
of
the
aerated
water
in
the
glass
but
now
a
shriek
like
that
of
a
frightened
woman
rang
out
into
the
room
and
it
came
from
me
i
was
gripped
horribly
by
the
back
of
the
throat
whirled
round
with
incredible
speed
and
force
and
flung
heavily
against
the
opposite
wall
falling
sideways
into
an
armchair
gasping
for
breath
and
my
eyes
staring
out
of
my
head
then
i
saw
him
mark
antony
midwinter
was
standing
on
the
other
side
of
the
table
smiling
at
me
he
wore
a
fashionable
morning
coat
and
a
silk
hat
under
his
left
arm
was
a
and
he
carried
his
gloves
in
his
left
hand
in
the
right
was
the
gleaming
of
an
automatic
pistol
pointed
at
my
heart
at
that
i
pulled
myself
together
in
an
instant
i
knew
that
i
had
failed
the
brute
must
already
have
been
in
the
house
when
sliddim
admitted
me
he
had
outwitted
all
of
us
ah
he
said
sir
thomas
kirby
you
have
crossed
my
path
very
many
times
of
late
sir
thomas
and
i
have
long
wished
to
make
your
acquaintance
his
voice
was
suave
and
cultured
the
rather
full
face
had
elements
of
fineness
many
women
would
have
called
him
a
handsome
man
but
in
his
dull
and
opaque
eyes
there
was
such
a
glare
of
cold
malignity
such
unutterable
cruelty
and
hate
that
the
whole
room
grew
like
an
in
a
moment
for
it
is
not
often
that
any
man
sees
a
veritable
fiend
of
hell
looking
out
of
the
eyes
of
another
you
have
come
a
little
earlier
than
i
expected
i
managed
to
say
but
my
voice
rang
cracked
and
thin
it
is
a
precaution
that
i
frequently
take
sir
thomas
and
one
very
much
justified
in
the
present
instance
to
tell
the
truth
i
had
little
or
no
suspicion
that
i
was
walking
into
a
trap
that
much
to
you
but
a
life
of
shocks
here
he
laughed
pleasantly
but
the
little
steel
disk
pointed
at
my
heart
never
wavered
a
hair
breadth
has
taught
me
always
to
have
something
in
reserve
i
see
that
i
shall
not
have
the
pleasure
of
settling
accounts
with
gideon
morse
and
his
daughter
well
that
can
wait
meanwhile
i
propose
within
a
few
seconds
to
remove
another
obstacle
from
my
path
do
you
think
the
mandarin
will
be
waiting
for
you
at
the
golden
gates
sir
thomas
kirby
so
this
was
the
end
i
braced
myself
to
meet
it
how
long
i
said
i
will
count
a
hundred
slowly
he
answered
he
began
and
i
stared
dumbly
at
the
pistol
i
could
not
think
i
could
not
commend
my
soul
to
my
maker
even
the
function
of
thought
was
entirely
arrested
thirty
and
then
i
suddenly
burst
out
laughing
my
laughter
i
know
was
perfectly
natural
full
of
genuine
merriment
something
had
happened
which
seemed
to
me
irresistibly
comic
he
stopped
and
stared
at
me
his
face
changing
ever
so
little
may
i
ask
he
said
what
tickled
your
sense
of
humor
what
had
tickled
my
sense
of
humor
was
this
stealing
round
from
behind
him
right
under
his
very
nose
so
to
speak
but
quite
unseen
was
an
arm
which
with
infinite
care
and
slowness
was
removing
the
heavy
decanter
from
the
table
it
vanished
it
reappeared
in
the
air
behind
him
in
a
flashing
diamond
and
amber
circle
have
some
whisky
mr
midwinter
i
said
as
it
descended
with
a
crash
upon
the
side
of
his
head
without
a
sound
he
sank
into
a
huddled
heap
out
of
my
sight
hidden
by
the
table
you
little
devil
i
said
staggering
to
my
feet
for
bill
rolston
stood
there
and
grinning
i
had
to
come
sir
thomas
he
said
it
was
any
use
have
you
killed
him
bill
we
bent
down
and
made
an
examination
midwinter
face
was
dark
and
suffused
with
blood
but
his
pulses
were
all
right
what
a
pity
said
rolston
help
me
to
get
him
on
to
that
chair
sir
thomas
and
we
tie
him
up
if
i
had
killed
him
it
would
have
been
so
much
simpler
we
dragged
the
unconscious
man
to
the
very
armchair
where
i
had
sat
under
the
menace
of
his
pistol
and
tearing
the
tablecloth
into
strips
tied
him
securely
fortunately
said
bill
i
did
break
the
decanter
the
stopper
did
even
come
out
you
look
pretty
sick
sir
thomas
and
indeed
a
horrible
feeling
of
nausea
had
come
over
me
and
my
hands
were
shaking
let
each
have
a
drink
and
then
i
tell
you
what
i
think
we
sat
down
on
each
side
of
the
table
and
i
listened
to
him
as
if
the
whole
thing
were
some
curious
dream
for
the
second
time
i
had
been
snatched
from
the
very
brink
of
death
and
though
i
suppose
i
ought
to
have
been
getting
used
to
it
my
only
sensation
was
one
of
limpness
and
collapse
can
you
do
it
my
little
friend
said
pointing
to
the
pistol
between
us
i
took
it
up
weighed
it
in
my
hand
it
at
the
stiff
figure
in
the
chair
and
laid
it
down
again
no
i
damned
if
i
can
i
answered
and
then
i
must
have
been
more
than
i
actually
said
you
have
a
go
bill
he
looked
at
me
in
horror
murder
him
in
cold
blood
i
should
never
know
a
moment
peace
sir
thomas
well
you
nearly
did
it
in
hot
and
you
just
been
tempting
me
let
us
bring
him
to
if
we
can
he
said
tactfully
changing
the
conversation
and
advancing
upon
our
friend
with
the
siphon
of
there
was
a
grotesque
horror
about
the
whole
of
our
adventure
that
night
i
laughed
weakly
as
the
soda
hissed
and
the
stream
of
aerated
water
splashed
over
midwinter
face
before
the
final
gurgle
he
awoke
his
eyes
opened
without
speculation
then
his
jaw
dropped
for
a
moment
his
face
was
as
vacant
as
a
doll
and
then
it
flared
up
into
a
snarl
of
realization
and
hatred
only
in
another
instant
to
settle
down
into
a
dead
calm
my
turn
now
i
said
he
knew
the
game
was
up
i
will
do
him
the
justice
to
say
he
did
not
flinch
very
well
count
a
hundred
was
his
answer
and
his
eye
fell
to
the
two
pistols
on
the
table
his
own
and
mine
i
shook
my
head
i
ca
do
it
i
wish
i
could
you
find
it
quite
easy
i
speak
from
experience
he
replied
with
a
desperate
evil
grin
no
i
have
talked
the
situation
over
with
my
friend
you
are
going
to
die
that
is
very
certain
but
not
by
my
hand
now
and
not
mr
midwinter
by
the
hand
of
the
english
law
he
was
very
quick
even
then
he
had
an
inkling
of
my
meaning
for
a
perceptible
shadow
fell
over
his
face
and
his
eyes
narrowed
to
slits
you
mean
we
are
going
to
telephone
to
the
city
in
the
clouds
people
will
come
from
there
and
take
you
away
that
will
be
easily
managed
you
will
have
some
form
of
trial
and
then
execution
i
never
saw
a
change
from
red
to
white
so
sudden
that
big
face
suddenly
became
a
hideous
sickly
white
toneless
and
opaque
like
the
belly
of
a
sole
you
wo
deliver
me
to
the
chinese
he
gasped
you
ca
know
them
as
i
do
they
take
a
week
killing
me
they
have
horrible
secrets
his
voice
died
away
in
a
whimper
and
if
ever
i
saw
a
man
in
deadly
terror
it
was
that
man
then
but
i
hardened
my
heart
i
remembered
how
morse
and
juanita
had
suffered
for
two
years
at
this
man
hands
i
remembered
four
murders
to
my
own
knowledge
and
i
shrugged
my
shoulders
i
ca
help
that
you
have
made
your
bed
and
you
must
lie
upon
it
but
such
a
bed
he
murmured
and
his
head
fell
forward
on
his
chest
his
arms
were
bound
at
the
elbow
but
he
could
move
the
lower
portion
and
he
now
brought
his
right
hand
to
his
face
i
telephone
said
bill
and
went
to
the
wall
by
the
door
where
hung
the
instrument
i
sat
gloomily
watching
the
man
in
the
chair
what
was
he
doing
his
jaw
was
moving
up
and
down
he
seemed
biting
at
his
wrist
suddenly
there
was
a
slight
tearing
ripping
noise
followed
by
a
jerk
backwards
of
his
head
and
a
deep
intake
of
the
breath
what
is
he
doing
rolston
said
turning
round
with
the
receiver
of
the
telephone
at
his
ear
midwinter
held
out
his
arm
i
saw
that
the
braid
round
the
cuff
of
his
morning
coat
was
hanging
in
a
little
strip
i
told
you
i
always
had
something
in
reserve
he
said
showing
all
his
teeth
as
he
grinned
at
me
always
something
up
my
sleeve
literally
in
this
case
i
have
just
swallowed
a
little
capsule
of
prussic
acid
which
if
you
want
to
learn
of
how
a
man
dies
who
has
swallowed
hydrocyanic
acid
the
correct
term
i
believe
consult
a
medical
dictionary
it
is
not
a
pleasant
thing
to
see
in
actual
operation
but
thank
heavens
it
is
speedy
the
sweat
was
pouring
down
my
face
when
it
was
over
but
bill
rolston
had
not
turned
a
hair
put
something
over
his
face
sir
thomas
he
said
and
i
get
through
to
mr
morse
envoi
i
take
up
my
pen
this
evening
exactly
ten
years
after
i
wrote
the
last
paragraph
of
the
above
narrative
to
read
of
james
antony
midwinter
dead
like
a
poisoned
rat
in
his
chair
with
a
sort
of
amazement
in
my
mind
the
whole
story
has
been
locked
in
a
safe
for
ten
long
years
and
that
blessed
and
happy
time
has
made
the
wild
adventures
the
terrible
moments
in
the
city
in
the
clouds
indeed
seem
things
far
off
and
long
ago
this
afternoon
i
paid
what
will
probably
be
my
last
visit
to
the
strange
kingdom
up
there
i
stood
with
my
little
son
viscount
kirby
and
my
small
daughter
lady
juanita
and
my
wife
the
countess
of
stax
at
a
very
solemn
ceremony
in
the
presence
of
a
government
official
a
representative
of
his
majesty
colonel
patrick
moore
of
the
irish
guards
the
cardinal
archbishop
and
a
few
private
friends
i
watched
the
elmwood
shell
containing
gideon
mendoza
morse
placed
in
its
marble
tomb
it
was
his
wish
to
be
buried
there
in
his
fantastic
city
and
no
one
said
him
nay
well
the
body
lies
in
its
place
two
hundred
weeping
chinamen
are
returning
to
the
flowery
land
wealthy
beyond
their
utmost
hopes
and
in
a
few
months
the
city
in
the
clouds
will
dissolve
and
disappear
the
rich
treasures
are
coming
to
stax
my
castle
in
norfolk
such
as
are
not
bequeathed
by
morse
munificence
to
the
museums
of
england
and
the
galleries
at
brazil
soon
the
immense
plateau
will
be
england
aerial
terminus
for
the
mail
ships
from
all
parts
of
the
world
while
gideon
morse
lived
it
was
impossible
to
publish
the
truth
it
is
to
appear
now
at
last
and
i
simply
want
to
tie
a
few
loose
ends
and
to
bring
down
the
curtain
leaving
nothing
unexplained
first
of
all
let
me
say
that
the
general
public
knew
nothing
at
all
of
the
horrors
in
which
i
was
so
intimately
concerned
juanita
and
i
were
married
very
quietly
in
westminster
cathedral
soon
after
midwinter
went
to
his
account
the
enormous
fortune
that
she
brought
me
supplementing
my
own
very
considerable
means
operated
in
the
natural
way
other
journals
were
added
to
the
and
we
started
a
great
campaign
for
the
sweetening
of
ordinary
life
and
not
unsuccessfully
as
every
one
knows
they
made
me
a
baron
and
four
years
afterwards
earl
of
stax
as
for
my
he
refused
to
budge
from
the
city
in
the
clouds
i
do
mean
that
he
did
make
appearances
in
society
but
he
loved
to
get
back
to
his
fantastic
haven
from
whence
like
a
magician
he
showered
benefits
upon
london
arthur
winstanley
as
everybody
knows
is
for
india
and
the
most
rising
politician
of
our
day
it
is
said
that
william
rolston
editor
of
the
is
our
most
brilliant
journalist
though
the
older
school
condemn
him
for
an
excess
of
imagination
i
saw
the
other
day
in
the
a
slashing
attack
upon
a
series
of
articles
which
had
recently
appeared
upon
china
and
which
the
critic
of
the
conclusively
proved
to
be
written
from
an
abysmal
depth
of
ignorance
i
do
often
go
to
the
office
now
though
i
am
still
proprietor
of
the
paper
but
when
i
do
and
sit
in
the
editorial
room
i
miss
julia
dewsbury
best
of
all
private
secretaries
since
the
beginning
of
the
world
bill
however
assures
me
that
she
is
all
right
entirely
taken
up
with
the
children
and
not
in
the
least
inclined
to
bully
him
in
spite
of
her
eight
years
advantage
in
age
to
that
woman
says
bill
reverentially
i
owe
everything
let
me
wind
up
properly
crouching
behind
a
high
wall
on
richmond
hill
is
a
modest
hostelry
still
known
as
the
golden
swan
it
is
still
my
property
and
pays
me
a
satisfactory
dividend
it
is
run
by
a
which
i
should
say
is
unique
the
honest
fool
and
my
preston
perform
this
feat
together
but
now
that
morse
is
dead
and
the
chinese
have
all
departed
i
fear
they
will
lose
a
good
deal
of
custom
this
i
gathered
from
mogridge
that
pillar
of
the
saloon
bar
who
happened
to
meet
me
by
chance
in
fleet
street
not
long
ago
why
it
thomas
late
landlord
of
the
swan
said
mogridge
seen
you
for
years
what
are
you
doing
now
oh
i
doing
very
well
thank
you
mogridge
and
how
is
the
old
same
as
ever
and
no
dropping
off
in
the
quality
of
the
drinks
still
i
fear
it
going
down
i
afraid
it
will
never
be
quite
the
same
as
it
was
in
the
days
of
and
here
mogridge
placed
his
hands
upon
his
hips
and
roared
with
laughter
at
that
ancient
joke
the
end
