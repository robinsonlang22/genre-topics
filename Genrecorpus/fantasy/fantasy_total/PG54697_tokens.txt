preface
the
english
translation
of
these
tales
has
been
made
by
special
request
to
meet
repeated
demands
for
a
translation
of
the
text
as
edited
by
the
late
duncan
forbes
the
aim
of
the
translator
has
been
to
produce
a
work
which
would
enable
the
student
to
study
the
original
with
facility
and
accuracy
it
being
considered
that
few
save
students
who
are
compelled
to
study
the
hindi
original
would
be
likely
to
peruse
the
work
the
translation
has
been
made
as
literal
as
it
was
possible
to
make
it
without
doing
unpardonable
violence
to
english
idiom
all
difficulties
have
been
boldly
if
not
successfully
met
and
explanatory
and
other
notes
have
been
added
wherever
the
text
appeared
to
call
for
such
the
study
of
the
translation
must
not
be
supposed
to
dispense
with
that
of
the
grammar
of
the
language
it
will
be
found
however
to
prove
of
the
highest
utility
to
a
student
who
has
mastered
the
elementary
principles
of
grammar
and
uses
it
not
as
a
mere
crib
but
for
the
purpose
of
discovering
what
light
it
sheds
on
the
application
of
those
principles

tale
there

a
city
named

the
king
of
which
was

he
had
four
queens
and
by
them
six
sons
one
more
learned
and
more
powerful
than
another
fate
ordaining
after
some
days
the
king
died
and
his
eldest
son
shank
by
name
became
king
in
his
stead
again
after
some
days
a
younger
brother
vikram
after
slaying
his
eldest
brother
himself
became
king
and
began
to
govern
well
day
by
day
his
dominion
so
increased
that
he
became
king
of
all
india
and
after
fixing
his
government
on
a
firm
basis
he
established
an
æra
jambudwip
is
the
name
of
one
of
the
seven
divisions
of
the
world
and
implies
the
central
division
or
the
known
world
according
to
the
bauddhas
it
is
confined
to
india
after
some
time
the
king
thought
to
himself
that
he
ought
to
visit
those
countries
of
which
he
had
heard
having
determined
on
this
he
made
over
his
throne
to
his
younger
brother
bharthari
and
himself
assuming
the
guise
of
a
devotee
set
out
to
wander
from
land
to
land
and
forest
to
forest
the
king
thought
in
his
mind
i
should
travel
over
those
countries
whose
names
i
am
a
brahman
was
practising
austerities
in
that
city
one
day
a
deity
brought
and
presented
to
him
the
fruit
of
immortality
he
then
took
the
fruit
home
and
said
to
his
wife
whoever
shall
eat
this
will
become
immortal
the
deity
told
me
this
at
the
time
of
giving
the
hearing
this
the
brahman
s
wife
wept
excessively
and
began
to
say
this
is
a
great
evil
we
have
to
suffer
for
becoming
immortal
how
long
shall
we
go
on
begging
alms
nay
to
die
is
better
than
this
for
if
we
die
then
we
escape
from
the
trials
of
the
then
the
brahman
said
i
took
the
fruit
and
brought
it
but
hearing
your
words
i
am
bereft
of
understanding
now
i
will
do
whatever
you
then
his
wife
said
to
him
give
this
fruit
to
the
king
and
in
exchange
for
it
take
wealth
whereby
we
may
enjoy
the
advantages
of
this
world
as
well
as
that
to
hearing
this
speech
the
brahman
went
to
the
king
and
gave
him
his
blessing
and
after
explaining
the
circumstances
of
the
fruit
said
great
king
do
you
take
this
fruit
and
give
me
some
wealth
there
is
happiness
for
me
in
your
being
theking
having
given
the
brahman
a
lakh
of
rupees
and
dismissed
him
entered
the
female
apartments
and
giving
the
fruit
to
the
queen
whom
he
loved
most
said
o
queen
do
thou
eat
this
for
thou
wilt
become
immortal
and
wilt
continue
young
for
the
queen
hearing
this
took
the
fruit
from
the
king
and
he
came
out
into
his
court
a
certain
kotwãl
was
the
paramour
of
that
queen
to
him
she
gave
the
fruit
it
so
happened
that
a
courtesan
was
the
kotwãl
s
mistress
he
gave
the
fruit
to
her
and
described
its
virtues
that
courtesan
thought
to
herself
that
the
fruit
was
a
fitting
present
for
the
king
determining
this
in
her
mind
she
went
and
presented
the
fruit
to
the
king
his
majesty
took
the
fruit
and
dismissed
her
with
much
wealth
and
contemplating
the
fruit
and
pondering
within
himself
he
became
sick
of
the
world
and
began
to
say
the
perishable
wealth
of
this
world
is
of
no
use
whatever
for
through
it
one
must
ultimately
fall
into
hell
preferable
to
this
is
the
practising
of
religious
duties
and
the
biding
in
the
remembrance
of
the
deity
whereby
it
may
be
well
in
the
coming
to
this
determination
he
entered
the
female
apartments
and
asked
the
queen
what
she
had
done
with
the
fruit
he
gave
her
she
replied
i
ate
it
then
the
king
showed
the
queen
that
fruit
she
on
the
instant
of
setting
eyes
on
it
stood
aghast
and
was
unable
to
make
any
reply
after
that
the
king
having
come
forth
had
the
fruit
washed
and
ate
it
and
abandoning
his
kingdom
and
throne
assumed
the
guise
of
a
devotee
and
betook
himself
unaccompanied
and
without
holding
communication
with
a
soul
to
the
jungle
the
throne
of
vikram
became
vacant
when
this
news
reached
king
indra
he
sent
a
demon
to
guard
dhãrãnagar
he
kept
watch
over
the
city
day
and
night
to
be
brief
the
report
of
this
matter
spread
from
country
to
country
that
king
bharthari
had
abandoned
his
government
and
gone
away
king
vikram
too
heard
the
news
and
immediately
came
to
his
country
it
was
then
midnight
he
was
entering
the
city
at
that
hour
when
that
demon
called
out
who
art
thou
and
whither
goest
thou
stand
still
and
mention
thy
then
the
king
said
it
is
i
king
vikram
i
am
entering
my
own
city
who
art
thou
to
challenge
me
then
the
demon
replied
saying
the
deities
have
sent
me
to
guard
this
city
if
you
are
really
king
vikram
first
fight
with
me
and
then
enter
the
on
hearing
these
words
the
king
girt
tight
his
and
challenged
the
demon
thereupon
the
demon
too
stood
up
to
him
the
battle
began
at
last
the
king
threw
the
demon
and
sat
upon
his
breast
then
he
said
o
king
thou
hast
thrown
me
i
grant
thy
life
as
a
upon
this
the
king
laughing
said
thou
art
gone
mad
whose
life
dost
thou
grant
did
i
will
i
could
slay
thee
how
canst
thou
grant
me
life
then
the
demon
said
o
king
i
am
about
to
save
thee
from
death
first
attend
to
a
tale
of
mine
and
thereafter
rule
over
the
whole
world
free
from
all
at
length
the
king
set
him
free
and
began
to
listen
attentively
to
his
tale
then
the
demon
addressed
him
thus
there
was
in
this
city
a
very
liberal
king
named
chandrabhãn
one
day
he
went
forth
casually
into
the
jungle
when
what
should
he
behold
but
an
ascetic
hanging
head
downwards
from
a
tree
and
sustaining
himself
by
inhaling
smoke
alone
neither
receiving
anything
from
any
one
nor
speaking
to
any
one
perceiving
this
state
of
his
the
king
returned
home
and
seating
himself
in
his
court
said
whoever
will
bring
this
ascetic
here
shall
receive
a
lakh
of
a
courtesan
bearing
these
words
came
to
the
king
and
spake
thus
if
i
obtain
your
majesty
s
leave
i
will
have
a
child
begotten
by
that
ascetic
and
bring
it
here
mounted
on
his
the
king
was
astonished
at
hearing
this
speech
and
binding
the
courtesan
to
the
fulfilment
of
her
contract
to
bring
the
ascetic
by
giving
her
a
flake
of
dismissed
her
she
went
to
that
wild
and
reaching
the
ascetic
s
place
perceived
that
he
was
really
hanging
neither
eating
nor
drinking
anything
and
that
he
was
withered
up
in
short
that
courtesan
prepared
some
sweetmeat
and
put
it
into
the
ascetic
s
mouth
he
finding
it
sweet
ate
it
up
with
zest
thereupon
the
courtesan
applied
more
to
his
mouth
thus
for
two
days
did
she
continue
feeding
him
with
sweetmeat
by
eating
which
he
gained
a
certain
degree
of
strength
then
opening
his
eyes
and
descending
from
the
tree
he
inquired
of
her
on
what
business
hast
thou
come
hither
i
am
obliged
to
render
thus
periphrastically
the
words
tapasvi
ke
lane
ke
waste
bïrã
dekar
the
birã
is
a
leaf
made
up
with
a
preparation
of
chunara
cloves
it
is
given
and
accepted
as
a
pledge
for
the
performance
of
an
act
the
courtesan
replied
i
am
the
daughter
of
a
god
i
was
practising
religious
austerities
in
heaven
i
have
now
come
into
this
the
devotee
said
again
where
is
thy
hut
show
me
thereupon
the
courtesan
brought
the
ascetic
to
her
hut
and
commenced
feeding
him
with
savoury
viands
so
that
the
ascetic
left
off
inhaling
smoke
and
took
to
eating
food
and
drinking
water
daily
eventually
cupid
troubled
him
upon
which
he
had
carnal
intercourse
with
her
and
vitiated
his
austerities
and
the
courtesan
became
pregnant
in
ten
months
a
boy
was
born
when
he
was
some
months
old
the
woman
said
to
the
devotee
o
saint
you
should
now
set
out
on
a
pilgrimage
whereby
all
the
sins
of
the
flesh
may
be
blotted
deluding
him
with
such
words
she
mounted
the
boy
on
his
shoulder
and
started
for
the
king
s
court
whence
she
had
set
out
after
taking
up
the
gage
to
accomplish
this
matter
when
she
came
before
the
king
his
majesty
recognised
her
from
a
distance
and
seeing
the
child
on
the
shoulder
of
the
devotee
began
saying
to
the
courtiers
just
see
this
is
the
very
same
courtesan
who
went
to
bring
the
devotee
they
replied
o
king
you
are
quite
right
this
is
the
very
same
and
be
pleased
to
observe
that
all
that
she
had
stated
in
your
majesty
s
presence
ere
she
set
forth
has
come
to
when
the
ascetic
heard
these
remarks
of
the
king
and
courtiers
he
perceived
that
the
king
had
adopted
these
measures
to
disturb
his
religious
meditations
with
these
thoughts
in
his
mind
the
devotee
returned
from
thence
and
getting
out
of
the
city
slew
the
child
repaired
to
another
jungle
and
began
to
perform
penance
and
after
some
time
that
king
died
and
the
devotee
completed
his
the
short
of
the
story
is
this
that
you
three
men
have
been
born
under
one
asterism
one
conjunction
and
in
one
moment
you
took
birth
in
a
king
s
house
the
second
was
an
oilman
s
child
the
third
the
devotee
was
born
in
a
potter
s
house
you
still
govern
here
while
the
oilman
s
son
the
ruler
of
the
infernal
regions
but
that
potter
bringing
his
religious
meditations
to
thorough
perfection
has
killed
the
oilman
turned
him
into
a
demon
in
a
and
placed
him
hanging
on
a
and
is
intent
on
killing
you
if
you
escape
him
you
will
rule
i
have
apprised
you
of
all
these
circumstances
do
not
be
careless
with
respect
to
having
narrated
thus
much
the
demon
departed
he
the
king
entered
his
private
palace
when
it
was
morn
the
king
came
forth
and
took
his
seat
on
the
throne
and
gave
the
order
for
a
general
court
as
many
servants
as
there
were
great
and
small
all
came
and
made
their
offerings
in
the
presence
and
festive
music
burst
forth
an
extraordinary
gladness
and
rejoicing
possessed
the
whole
city
such
that
in
every
place
and
every
house
dance
and
song
arose
after
this
the
king
began
to
govern
justly
it
is
related
that
one
day
an
ascetic
named
appeared
at
the
king
s
court
with
a
fruit
in
his
hand
and
presenting
the
fruit
to
the
king
spread
a
cloth
and
sat
down
there
after
a
short
time
he
went
away
again
on
his
departure
the
king
thought
to
himself
that
this
was
probably
the
person
of
whom
the
demon
had
spoken
habouring
this
suspicion
he
did
not
eat
the
fruit
and
summoning
the
steward
he
gave
it
to
him
with
instructions
to
keep
it
carefully
the
devotee
however
came
constantly
in
this
same
manner
and
left
a
fruit
every
day
it
so
happened
that
one
day
the
king
went
to
inspect
his
stable
accompanied
by
some
attendants
during
that
interval
the
ascetic
too
arrived
there
and
presented
the
king
with
a
fruit
in
the
usual
manner
he
began
tossing
it
in
the
air
when
all
of
a
sudden
it
fell
from
his
hand
on
the
ground
and
a
monkey
took
it
up
and
broke
it
in
pieces
so
exquisite
a
ruby
came
out
of
it
that
the
king
and
his
attendants
were
astonished
at
the
sight
of
its
brilliance
thereupon
the
king
said
to
the
devotee
why
hast
thou
given
me
this
ruby
on
this
he
said
o
great
king
it
is
written
in
the
shastra
that
one
should
not
go
to
the
following
places
those
of
kings
spiritual
teachers
astrologers
physicians
and
daughters
for
at
these
places
one
obtains
benefit
for
benefit
sire
why
do
you
speak
of
a
single
ruby
as
many
fruits
as
i
have
given
you
every
one
of
them
contains
a
hearing
these
words
the
king
told
the
steward
to
bring
all
the
fruits
he
had
given
to
him
on
receiving
the
king
s
order
the
steward
immediately
brought
them
and
having
had
the
fruits
broken
open
he
found
a
ruby
in
each
when
he
beheld
so
many
rubies
the
king
was
excessively
pleased
and
summoning
a
tester
of
precious
stones
began
having
the
rubies
tested
saying
the
while
nothing
will
accompany
one
from
this
world
integrity
is
the
great
essential
in
the
world
tell
me
honestly
therefore
the
exact
value
of
each
hearing
these
words
the
jeweller
said
o
king
you
have
spoken
the
truth
he
whose
integrity
is
safe
his
all
is
safe
integrity
alone
accompanies
us
and
that
it
is
which
proves
of
advantage
in
both
worlds
hear
o
king
each
gem
is
perfect
as
to
colour
stone
and
form
were
i
to
declare
the
value
of
each
to
be
a
crore
of
rupees
even
that
would
not
come
up
to
the
mark
of
a
truth
each
gem
is
worth
a
hearing
this
the
king
was
pleased
beyond
measure
and
conferring
a
robe
of
honour
on
the
jeweller
dismissed
him
and
taking
the
devotee
s
hand
he
brought
and
seated
him
on
the
throne
and
began
thus
my
whole
realm
is
not
worth
even
one
of
these
rubies
tell
me
then
what
is
the
explanation
of
this
that
you
a
religious
mendicant
have
presented
me
with
so
many
gems
the
ascetic
said
your
majesty
it
is
not
proper
to
speak
publicly
of
the
following
things
magic
and
incantations
drugs
employed
in
medicines
religious
duties
family
affairs
the
eating
of
impure
meats
evil
speech
which
one
has
heard
all
these
things
are
not
spoken
of
in
public
i
will
tell
you
in
private
attend
it
is
a
rule
that
whatever
is
heard
by
three
pairs
of
ears
remains
no
secret
the
words
which
reach
two
pairs
of
ears
no
man
hears
while
the
contents
of
one
pair
of
ears
are
unknown
to
brahma
himself
not
to
speak
of
on
hearing
these
words
the
king
took
the
devotee
apart
and
began
to
say
o
holy
man
you
have
given
me
so
many
rubies
and
have
not
once
partaken
of
food
even
you
have
put
me
to
great
shame
let
me
know
what
it
is
you
the
ascetic
said
sire
i
am
about
to
practice
magical
arts
in
a
large
on
the
bank
of
the
river
godavari
whereby
i
shall
acquire
supernatural
powers
and
so
i
beg
of
you
to
pass
one
whole
night
with
me
by
your
being
near
me
my
magic
arts
will
then
the
king
said
very
well
i
will
come
leave
word
with
me
of
the
the
ascetic
said
do
you
come
to
me
armed
and
unattended
on
the
tuesday
evening
of
the
dark
half
of
the
month
the
king
replied
you
may
go
i
will
assuredly
come
and
having
thus
exacted
a
promise
from
the
king
and
taken
leave
he
for
his
part
went
into
a
temple
and
made
preparations
and
taking
all
necessaries
with
him
went
and
fixed
himself
in
a
place
for
burning
bodies
while
here
the
king
began
to
ponder
over
what
had
happened
in
the
meantime
the
moment
for
him
to
depart
too
arrived
upon
this
the
king
there
and
then
girt
on
his
sword
tightened
the
cloth
he
wore
between
his
legs
and
betook
himself
alone
to
the
devotee
by
night
and
greeted
him
the
devotee
requested
him
to
be
seated
whereupon
the
king
sat
down
and
then
perceived
goblins
evil
spirits
and
witches
in
various
frightful
shapes
dancing
around
while
the
ascetic
seated
in
the
centre
was
striking
two
skulls
together
by
way
of
music
the
king
felt
no
fear
or
alarm
on
beholding
this
state
of
things
but
said
to
the
devotee
what
command
is
there
for
me
he
replied
o
king
now
that
you
have
come
do
this
at
a
distance
of
two
south
of
this
place
is
a
wherein
is
a
on
which
a
corpse
is
suspended
bring
that
corpse
to
me
at
once
to
this
place
where
i
shall
be
performing
my
having
despatched
the
king
thither
he
himself
settled
down
in
devotional
attitude
and
began
muttering
prayers
for
one
thing
the
darkness
of
the
night
was
in
itself
terrifying
more
than
this
the
downpour
of
the
rain
was
as
unceasing
as
if
it
would
rain
for
once
and
all
that
night
whilst
the
goblins
and
ghosts
too
were
creating
such
an
uproar
that
even
daring
heroes
would
have
been
agitated
at
the
spectacle
the
king
however
went
on
his
way
the
snakes
which
kept
coming
and
twining
themselves
about
his
legs
he
used
to
disentangle
by
repeating
incantations
at
length
when
after
passing
somehow
or
other
over
a
perilous
road
the
king
reached
the
he
perceived
that
goblins
were
constantly
seizing
men
and
destroying
them
witches
continually
munching
the
livers
of
children
tigers
were
roaring
and
elephants
screaming
in
short
when
he
noticed
the
tree
he
perceived
that
every
leaf
and
branch
of
it
from
the
root
to
the
topmost
twig
was
burning
furiously
while
from
all
four
sides
arose
a
tumultuous
cry
of
kill
him
kill
him
seize
him
seize
him
take
care
he
does
not
escape
the
king
had
no
fears
on
beholding
that
state
of
things
but
he
said
to
himself
it
may
or
may
not
be
so
but
i
am
convinced
this
is
the
same
devotee
about
whom
the
demon
spoke
to
and
having
gone
close
and
observed
he
perceived
a
corpse
fastened
by
a
string
and
hanging
head
downwards
he
was
glad
to
see
the
corpse
thinking
his
trouble
had
been
rewarded
taking
his
sword
and
shield
he
climbed
the
tree
fearlessly
and
struck
such
a
blow
with
the
sword
that
the
rope
was
severed
and
the
corpse
fell
down
and
instantly
began
to
weep
aloud
on
hearing
his
voice
the
king
was
pleased
and
began
to
say
to
himself
well
this
man
at
least
is
then
descending
he
enquired
of
him
who
he
was
he
burst
out
laughing
as
soon
as
he
heard
the
question
the
king
was
greatly
astonished
at
this
again
the
corpse
climbed
up
the
tree
and
suspended
himself
the
king
too
that
instant
climbed
up
and
clutching
him
under
his
arm
brought
him
down
and
said
vile
wretch
tell
me
who
thou
he
made
no
reply
the
king
reflected
and
said
to
himself
perhaps
this
is
the
very
oilman
whom
the
demon
said
the
devotee
had
deposited
in
the
place
where
bodies
are
thus
reflecting
he
bound
him
up
in
his
mantle
and
brought
him
to
the
devotee
the
man
who
displays
such
courage
will
be
sure
to
succeed
in
his
then
the
sprite
said
who
art
thou
and
whither
art
thou
taking
me
the
king
replied
i
am
king
vikram
and
am
taking
thee
off
to
a
he
rejoined
i
will
go
on
one
condition
if
thou
utterest
a
word
on
the
way
i
will
come
straight
the
king
agreed
to
his
condition
and
went
off
with
him
then
the
sprite
said
o
king
those
who
are
learned
discerning
and
wise
days
are
passed
in
the
delight
of
song
and
the
shãstras
while
the
days
of
the
unwise
and
foolish
are
spent
in
dissipation
and
sleep
hence
it
is
best
that
this
long
road
should
be
beguiled
by
profitable
converse
do
you
attend
o
king
to
the
story
i
betal
or
baitãl
is
a
sprite
haunting
cemeteries
or
rather
places
where
bodies
are
burned
and
animating
dead
bodies
tale
i
there
was
a
king
of
banãras
named
pratãpmukut
and
was
the
name
of
his
son
whose
queen
s
name
was
mahãdevï
one
day
the
prince
accompanied
by
his
minister
s
son
went
to
the
chase
and
advanced
far
into
a
jungle
in
the
midst
of
which
he
beheld
a
beautiful
tank
on
the
margin
of
which
wild
geese
brãhmanï
ducks
male
and
female
cranes
and
were
one
and
all
disporting
on
all
four
sides
of
solid
masonry
were
constructed
within
the
tank
the
lotus
was
in
full
bloom
on
the
sides
were
planted
trees
of
different
kinds
under
the
dense
shade
of
which
the
breezes
came
cool
and
refreshing
while
birds
were
warbling
on
the
boughs
and
in
the
forest
bloomed
flowers
of
varied
hues
on
which
whole
swarms
of
bees
were
buzzing
such
was
the
scene
when
they
arrived
by
the
margin
of
that
tank
and
washed
their
hands
and
faces
and
reascended
on
that
spot
was
a
temple
sacred
to
mahãdeva
fastening
their
horses
and
entering
the
temple
they
paid
adoration
to
mahãdeva
and
came
out
while
they
were
engaged
in
adoration
the
daughter
of
a
certain
king
accompanied
by
a
host
of
attendants
came
to
another
margin
of
the
tank
to
bathe
and
having
finished
her
ablutions
meditations
and
prayers
she
with
her
own
maidens
began
to
walk
about
in
the
shade
of
the
trees
on
this
side
the
minister
s
son
was
seated
and
the
king
s
son
was
walking
about
when
suddenly
his
eyes
and
the
eyes
of
the
king
s
daughter
met
as
soon
as
he
beheld
her
beauty
the
king
s
son
was
fascinated
and
began
saying
to
himself
you
wretch
cupid
why
do
you
molest
me
and
when
the
princess
beheld
the
prince
she
took
in
her
hand
the
which
she
had
fixed
on
her
head
after
her
devotions
placed
it
to
her
ear
bit
it
with
her
teeth
put
it
under
her
foot
then
took
it
up
and
pressed
it
to
her
bosom
and
taking
her
maidens
with
her
mounted
her
chariot
and
departed
and
the
prince
sinking
into
the
depths
of
despair
and
overwhelmed
with
grief
on
account
of
her
absence
came
to
the
minister
s
son
and
with
a
feeling
of
shame
laid
before
him
the
actual
state
of
affairs
saying
o
friend
i
have
seen
a
most
beautiful
damsel
but
i
know
neither
her
name
nor
her
abode
should
i
not
possess
her
i
will
give
up
my
life
this
i
am
firmly
resolved
upon
in
my
hearing
these
circumstances
the
minister
s
son
caused
him
to
mount
and
brought
him
home
it
is
true
but
the
king
s
son
was
so
restless
from
grief
at
separation
that
he
entirely
abandoned
writing
reading
eating
drinking
sleeping
the
business
of
government
everything
he
used
to
be
constantly
sketching
her
portrait
and
gazing
at
it
and
weeping
not
speaking
himself
nor
listening
to
what
others
when
the
minister
s
son
saw
this
state
of
his
the
result
of
separation
from
his
flame
he
said
to
him
whosoever
treads
the
path
of
love
doth
not
survive
or
if
he
survive
he
suffers
great
sorrow
on
this
account
the
wise
avoid
treading
this
the
king
s
son
on
hearing
his
words
replied
i
in
sooth
have
entered
upon
this
path
be
there
joy
in
it
or
be
there
when
he
heard
so
determined
a
speech
from
him
he
the
minister
s
son
said
great
king
at
the
time
of
leaving
did
she
say
anything
to
you
or
you
to
her
upon
this
he
made
answer
saying
i
said
nothing
nor
did
i
hear
anything
from
then
the
minister
s
son
said
it
will
be
very
difficult
to
find
he
said
if
she
be
secured
my
life
will
be
preserved
otherwise
it
is
whosoever
has
placed
his
step
in
the
path
of
love
has
not
survived
after
it
or
if
he
has
survived
then
he
has
experienced
great
affliction
he
enquired
again
did
she
make
no
signs
even
the
prince
said
these
are
the
gestures
she
made
suddenly
seeing
me
she
took
the
from
her
head
put
it
to
her
ear
bit
it
with
her
teeth
placed
it
under
her
foot
and
pressed
it
to
her
on
hearing
this
the
minister
s
son
said
i
have
comprehended
her
signs
and
discovered
her
name
habitation
and
all
about
he
the
prince
replied
explain
to
me
whatever
you
have
he
began
to
say
attend
o
king
her
having
taken
the
from
her
head
and
put
it
to
her
ear
is
equivalent
to
her
having
informed
you
that
she
is
an
inhabitant
of
the
karnãtak
carnatic
and
in
biting
it
with
her
teeth
she
intimated
that
she
is
the
daughter
of
king
and
by
pressing
it
under
her
foot
she
declared
that
her
name
is
padmãvati
and
in
again
taking
it
up
and
pressing
it
to
her
bosom
she
informed
you
that
you
dwell
in
her
when
the
prince
heard
these
words
he
said
to
him
it
is
advisable
that
you
take
me
to
the
city
in
which
she
no
sooner
had
he
said
this
than
both
dressed
themselves
girt
on
their
arms
and
taking
some
jewels
with
them
mounted
their
horses
and
took
the
road
to
that
having
reached
the
kamãtak
after
several
days
and
having
arrived
below
the
palaces
of
the
king
in
their
stroll
through
the
city
what
do
they
see
there
but
an
old
woman
sitting
at
her
door
and
plying
her
the
two
dismounting
from
their
horses
approached
her
and
began
to
say
mother

are
travelling
merchants

following
us

have
come
on
ahead
to
seek
a
lodging
if
you
will
give
us
a
place
we
will
on
looking
at
their
faces
and
hearing
their
words
the
old
woman
took
compassion
on
them
and
said
this
house
is
yours

here
as
long
as
you
please
in
short
they
took
possession
of
the
house
on
hearing
this
and
after
some
delay
the
old
woman
came
and
kindly
sat
with
them
and
began
chatting
with
them
on
this
the
minister
s
son
enquired
of
her
what
family
and
relations
have
you
got
and
how
do
you
subsist
the
old
woman
said
my
son

the
king
s
service
and
your
humble
servant
is
the
of
padmãvatï

once
a
day
however

go
regularly
to

girl
it
is
on
my
return
from
thence
in
my
home
alone

i
give
vent
to
my
hearing
these
words
the
prince
rejoiced
at
heart
and
said
to
the
old
woman

are
starting

replied

there
she
found
the
princess
sitting
alone
when
she
appeared
before

to

are
on
hearing
these
words
she
became
angry
and
applying
sandal
to
her
hands
and
slapping
the
face
of
the
old
woman
began
to
say
wretch

out
of
my
house

rose
annoyed
and
went
in
that
very
condition
straight
to
the
prince
and
related
all
that
had
happened
to
her
the
prince
was
astounded
at
these
words
then
the
minister
s
son
spoke
saying

not
come
within
your

said

said
in
smearing
sandal
on
the
ten
fingers
and
striking
the
woman
on
the
face

intimated
that

ten
nights
of

will
meet

brief
after
ten
days
the
old
woman
again
went
and
announced
him
then
she
tinged
three
of
her
fingers
with
saffron
and
struck
them
on
her
cheek
saying
get
out
of
my
house
after
all
the
old
woman
moved
from
thence
in
despair
and
came
and
related
to
the
prince
all
that
had
occurred
he
was
engulfed
in
an
ocean
of
sorrow
as
soon
as
he
heard
it
seeing
this
state
of
his
the
minister
s
son
said
again
be
not
alarmed
the
purport
of
this
matter
is
something
he
replied
my
heart
is
disquieted
tell
me
then
he
said
she
is
in
the
state
which
women
are
in
every
month
and
hence
has
stipulated
for
three
days
more
on
the
fourth
day
she
will
send
for
in
short
when
the
three
days
elapsed
the
old
woman
made
enquiries
after
her
health
on
the
part
of
the
prince
then
she
brought
the
old
woman
angrily
to
the
western
wicket
and
turned
her
out
again
the
old
woman
came
and
informed
the
prince
of
this
event
he
became
at
hearing
it
on
this
the
minister
s
son
said
the
explanation
of
the
affair
is
that
she
has
invited
you
by
way
of
that
he
was
pleased
beyond
measure
at
hearing
this
to
be
brief
when
the
hour
arrived
they
took
out
brown
suits
of
clothes
arranged
them
fastened
on
their
turbands
dressed
themselves
placed
their
weapons
in
order
about
them
and
were
ready
by
this
time
midnight
had
passed
at
that
time
an
universal
stillness
prevailed
when
they
too
pursued
their
way
in
unbroken
when
they
arrived
near
the
wicket
the
minister
s
son
remained
standing
without
and
he
the
prince
entered
the
wicket
what
does
he
perceive
but
the
princess
too
standing
there
expecting
him
thus
their
eyes
met
then
the
princess
laughed
and
closing
the
wicket
took
the
prince
with
her
into
the
festive
chamber
arrived
there
the
prince
beheld
censers
filled
with
perfume
alight
in
different
parts
of
the
room
and
maidens
dressed
in
garments
of
various
colours
standing
respectfully
with
hands
joined
each
according
to
her
station
on
one
side
a
couch
of
flowers
spread
bottles
trays
and
boxes
arranged
in
order
on
another
side
compound
essences
prepared
mixed
perfumes
musk
and
saffron
filled
in
metal
cups
here
coloured
boxes
of
exquisite
confections
laid
out
there
sweetmeats
of
various
kinds
placed
in
order
all
the
doors
and
walls
adorned
with
pictures
and
paintings
and
holding
such
faces
that
the
beholder
would
be
enchanted
at
the
very
sight
of
each
single
one
in
short
everything
that
could
contribute
to
pleasure
and
enjoyment
was
got
together
the
whole
scene
was
one
of
an
extraordinary
character
of
which
no
adequate
description
can
be
such
was
the
apartment
to
which
the
princess
padmãvatï
took
the
prince
and
gave
him
a
seat
and
having
his
feet
washed
and
applying
sandal
to
his
body
and
placing
a
garland
of
flowers
round
his
neck
and
sprinkling
over
him
began
fanning
him
with
her
own
hands
upon
this
the
prince
said
at
the
mere
sight
of
you
i
have
become
refreshed
why
do
you
take
so
much
trouble
these
delicate
hands
are
not
fit
to
handle
a
fan
give
me
the
fan
you
be
padmãvatï
replied
great
king
you
have
been
at
great
trouble
to
come
here
for
my
sake
it
behoves
me
to
wait
upon
then
a
maiden
took
the
fan
from
the
princess
s
hand
and
said
this
is
my
business
i
will
attend
on
you
and
do
you
both
enjoy
they
began
eating
together
and
engaging
in
familiar
conversation
when
by
this
time
it
became
morning
the
princess
concealed
him
and
when
night
came
on
they
again
engaged
in
amorous
pleasures
thus
several
days
passed
away
whenever
the
prince
showed
a
wish
to
depart
the
princess
would
not
permit
him
a
month
passed
thus
then
the
prince
became
much
disturbed
and
very
once
it
happened
that
he
was
sitting
alone
by
night
and
thinking
thus
to
himself
country
throne
family
everything
had
already
been
separated
from
me
but
such
a
friend
as
mine
by
whose
means
i
found
all
this
happiness
even
him
have
i
not
met
for
a
whole
month
what
will
he
be
saying
in
his
heart
and
how
do
i
know
what
may
be
happening
to
him
he
was
sitting
occupied
with
these
anxious
thoughts
when
in
the
meanwhile
the
princess
too
arrived
and
seeing
his
predicament
began
to
inquire
great
king
what
grief
possesses
you
that
you
are
sitting
so
dispirited
here
tell
then
he
said
i
have
a
very
dear
friend
the
son
of
the
minister
for
a
whole
month
i
have
received
no
accounts
of
him
he
is
such
a
clever
learned
friend
that
through
talents
it
was
that
i
obtained
thee
and
it
was
who
explained
all
thy
the
princess
said
great
king
your
soul
is
really
there
what
happiness
can
you
enjoy
here
hence
this
is
best
i
will
prepare
confections
and
sweetmeats
and
all
kinds
of
meats
and
have
them
sent
do
you
too
go
there
and
feast
and
comfort
him
well
and
return
with
your
mind
at
on
hearing
this
the
prince
rose
up
and
came
forth
and
the
princess
had
different
kinds
of
sweetmeats
with
poison
mixed
cooked
and
sent
the
prince
had
but
just
gone
and
sat
beside
the
minister
s
son
when
the
sweetmeats
arrived
the
minister
s
son
enquired
great
king
how
did
these
sweetmeats
come
here
the
prince
replied
i
was
sitting
there
anxious
concerning
you
when
the
princess
came
and
looking
at
me
asked
why
do
you
sit
explain
the
reason
of
on
this
i
gave
her
a
full
account
of
your
skill
in
reading
secrets
on
hearing
this
account
she
gave
me
permission
to
come
to
you
and
had
these
sent
for
you
if
you
will
partake
of
them
my
heart
too
will
be
then
the
minister
s
son
said
you
have
brought
poison
for
me
it
is
well
indeed
that
did
not
eat
of
it
sire
listen
to
a
word
from
me
a
woman
has
no
love
for
her
lover
s
friend
you
did
not
act
wisely
in
mentioning
my
name
on
hearing
this
the
prince
said
you
talk
of
such
a
thing
as
no
one
would
ever
do
if
man
have
no
fear
of
man
it
is
to
be
presumed
he
fears
god
at
in
thus
translating
i
take
as
a
compound
other
translators
render
it
the
secrets
of
your
cleverness
which
seems
to
me
to
be
grammatically
inadmissible
and
to
lose
the
sense
with
these
words
he
took
a
round
sweetmeat
from
among
them
and
threw
it
to
a
dog
as
soon
as
the
dog
ate
it
he
died
convulsed
seeing
this
turn
of
affairs
the
prince
became
incensed
and
began
to
say
it
is
unbecoming
to
associate
with
so
false
a
woman
up
to
this
hour
her
love
has
found
place
in
my
heart
now
however
it
is
all
on
hearing
this
the
minister
s
son
said
your
majesty
what
has
happened
has
happened
let
bygones
be
bygones
you
should
now
act
in
such
a
manner
that
you
may
be
able
to
get
her
away
to
your
the
prince
said
brother
this
too
can
be
accomplished
by
you
the
minister
s
son
said
do
this
one
thing
go
again
to
padmãvati
and
do
just
what
i
tell
you
first
go
and
display
much
regard
and
affection
for
her
and
when
she
falls
asleep
take
off
her
jewels
and
strike
her
on
the
left
thigh
with
this
trident
and
instantly
come
away
from
this
translation
may
seem
rather
free
but
it
is
not
wide
of
the
sense
which
is
i
know
well
that
i
have
no
lore
for
her
this
peculiarly
idiomatic
use
of
the
word
mdlum
occurs
in
the
arãyishi
mahfil
and
many
other
urdu
works
and
has
ever
proved
a
to
translators
having
received
these
instructions
the
prince
went
to
padmãvati
at
night
and
after
much
affectionate
conversation
they
both
lay
down
together
to
sleep
but
he
was
secretly
watching
his
be
brief
when
the
princess
fell
asleep
he
took
off
all
her
ornaments
struck
her
on
the
left
thigh
with
the
trident
and
came
to
his
own
house
he
recounted
all
the
occurrences
to
the
minister
s
son
and
laid
the
jewels
before
him
he
then
took
up
the
jewels
took
the
prince
with
him
and
assuming
the
guise
of
a
devotee
went
and
sat
in
a
place
for
burning
bodies
he
himself
took
the
part
of
a
spiritual
teacher
and
making
him
the
prince
his
disciple
said
to
him
you
go
into
the
market
and
sell
these
jewels
if
anyone
should
seize
you
while
doing
this
bring
him
to
receiving
his
instructions
the
prince
took
the
jewels
with
him
to
the
city
and
showed
them
to
a
goldsmith
in
close
proximity
to
the
king
s
as
soon
as
he
saw
them
he
recognised
them
and
said
these
are
the
princess
s
jewels
tell
me
truly
where
did
you
get
them
he
was
saying
this
to
him
when
ten
or
twenty
more
men
gathered
round
to
be
brief
the
kotwãl
hearing
the
news
sent
men
and
had
the
prince
together
with
the
jewels
and
the
goldsmith
seized
and
brought
before
him
and
inspecting
the
jewels
asked
him
to
state
truly
where
he
had
got
them
when
he
said
my
spiritual
preceptor
has
given
them
to
me
to
sell
but
i
know
not
whence
he
got
them
then
the
kotwãl
had
the
preceptor
also
apprehended
and
brought
before
him
and
taking
them
both
together
with
the
jewels
into
the
presence
of
the
king
related
all
the
on
hearing
the
narrative
the
king
addressed
the
devotee
saying
master
whence
did
you
obtain
these
jewels
the
devotee
said
your
majesty
on
the
fourteenth
night
of
the
dark
lunar
fortnight
i
visited
a
to
perfect
some
spells
for
a
witch
when
the
witch
came
i
took
off
her
jewels
and
apparel
and
made
the
impression
of
a
trident
on
her
left
thigh
in
this
way
these
ornaments
came
into
my
on
hearing
this
statement
of
the
devotee
s
the
king
went
into
his
private
apartments
and
the
devotee
to
his
seat
in
the
the
king
said
to
the
queen
just
see
if
there
is
a
mark
on
padmãvati
s
left
thigh
or
not
and
if
so
what
sort
of
a
mark
there
the
queen
having
gone
and
looked
found
the
mark
of
a
trident
she
returned
and
said
to
the
king
your
majesty
there
are
three
parallel
marks
indeed
it
appears
as
if
some
one
had
struck
her
with
a
the
ãsan
is
generally
the
skin
of
a
deer
or
leopard
or
tiger
which
religious
mendicants
carry
with
them
to
sit
upon
the
hide
of
a
black
antelope
is
commonly
preferred
some
of
the
gods
are
fabled
to
use
the
for
the
purpose
on
hearing
this
account
the
king
came
out
and
sent
for
the
kotwãl
and
told
him
to
go
and
bring
the
devotee
the
kotwãl
set
off
to
bring
the
devotee
on
the
instant
of
receiving
the
order
and
the
king
began
reflecting
thus
the
affairs
of
one
s
household
and
the
intentions
of
one
s
heart
and
any
loss
which
has
befallen
one
these
it
is
not
right
to
disclose
to
anyone
when
in
the
interval
the
kotwãl
brought
the
devotee
into
the
presence
then
the
king
took
the
devotee
aside
and
questioned
him
saying
spiritual
guide
what
punishment
is
laid
down
in
the
scriptures
for
a
woman
on
this
the
devotee
said
your
majesty
if
a
brahman
a
cow
a
wife
a
child
or
any
one
dependent
on
us
be
guilty
of
a
disgraceful
act
it
is
prescribed
that
such
should
be
banished
from
the
on
hearing
this
the
king
had
padmãvati
conveyed
away
in
a
litter
and
left
in
a
jungle
thereupon
both
the
prince
and
the
minister
s
son
started
from
their
lodging
on
horseback
went
to
that
jungle
took
the
princess
padmãvati
with
them
and
set
out
for
their
own
country
after
some
days
each
reached
his
father
s
house
the
greatest
joy
took
possession
of
all
high
and
low
and
these
the
prince
and
the
princess
entered
upon
a
life
of
mutual
after
relating
so
much
of
the
tale
the
sprite
asked
king
vikramãjït
to
which
of
those
four
does
guilt
attach
if
you
do
not
decide
this
point
you
will
be
cast
into
king
vikram
said
the
guilt
attaches
to
the
the
sprite
replied
how
does
the
sin
fall
on
the
king
vikram
answered
him
thus
the
minister
s
son
simply
did
his
duty
to
his
master
and
the
kotwãl
obeyed
the
king
s
command
and
the
princess
attained
her
object
hence
the
guilt
falls
on
the
king
for
having
inconsiderately
expelled
her
from
the
on
hearing
these
words
from
the
king
s
mouth
the
sprite
went
and
suspended
himself
on
that
same
tree
tale
ii
on
looking
about
him
the
king
perceived
that
the
sprite
was
not
present
so
he
went
straight
away
back
and
reaching
that
place
climbed
up
the
tree
bound
the
corpse
and
placing
him
on
his
shoulders
set
off
then
the
sprite
said
o
king
the
second
story
is
as
follows
on
the
bank
of
the
yamunã
jamnã
is
a
city
named
dharmmasthal
the
king
of
which
is
named
gunãdhip
moreover
a
brahman
named
kesava
lives
there
who
is
in
the
habit
of
performing
his
devotions
and
religious
duties
on
the
banks
of
the
jamnã
and
his
daughter
s
name
was
madhumãvati
she
was
very
beautiful
when
she
became
marriageable
her
mother
father
and
brother
were
all
three
intent
on
getting
her
married
it
happened
that
while
her
father
had
gone
one
day
with
one
of
his
supporters
to
a
marriage
ceremony
somewhere
and
her
brother
to
his
teacher
s
in
the
village
for
instruction
in
their
absence
a
brahman
s
son
came
to
the
house
her
mother
seeing
the
youth
s
beauty
and
excellent
qualities
said
i
will
give
my
daughter
in
marriage
to
and
there
the
brahman
had
agreed
to
give
his
daughter
to
a
young
brahman
while
his
son
had
given
his
word
to
a
brahman
at
the
place
where
he
had
gone
to
study
that
he
would
give
him
his
jafman
from
the
sanskrit
yajamãna
is
a
person
who
institutes
a
sacrifice
and
pays
for
it
in
a
village
where
there
is
a
hereditary
priest
the
priest
s
fees
are
paid
by
the
villagers
who
constitute
his
jajmãn
and
that
whether
they
choose
to
employ
his
services
or
those
of
any
other
priest
i
object
therefore
to
the
meaning
of
employer
as
being
inexact
and
to
that
of
customer
as
being
both
inexact
and
inelegant
after
some
days
those
two
the
father
and
son
arrived
with
the
two
youths
and
here
at
home
the
third
youth
was
stopping
from
the
first
awaiting
them
one
s
name
was
tribikram
the
other
s
bãman
the
third
s
madhusüdan
they
were
all
on
a
par
in
point
of
good
looks
moral
excellence
learning
and
age
on
seeing
them
the
brahman
began
to
reflect
thus
one
girl
and
three
to
whom
shall
i
give
her
to
whom
not
and
we
have
all
three
given
our
words
to
the
three
of
them
this
is
a
strange
piece
of
business
that
has
happened
what
shall
i
do
he
was
sitting
reflecting
thus
when
in
the
meantime
a
snake
bit
the
girl
and
she
died
on
hearing
the
news
her
father
brother
and
the
three
youths
all
five
ran
off
in
a
body
and
after
much
toil
and
trouble
brought
all
the
conjurers
and
as
many
practisers
of
magic
arts
for
the
purpose
of
expelling
poison
as
there
were
in
the
place
they
all
looked
at
the
girl
and
said
she
could
not
be
restored
to
life
the
first
said
a
man
bitten
by
a
snake
on
the
fifth
sixth
eighth
nine
or
fourteenth
day
of
the
lunar
month
does
not
a
second
said
one
who
has
been
bitten
on
a
saturday
or
tuesday
too
does
not
a
third

poison
which
has
ascended
into
the
system
when
the
moon
is
in
the
fourth
tenth
ninth
sixteenth
nineteenth
and
third

of
its
path
does
not

in
any
of
the
following
members
an
organ
of

the

neck
the
abdomen
or
the
navel
can
not
any
one
who
has
seen
the
conjurers
at
work
will
know
that
the
operator
always
pretends
to
work

with
the

a
fifth
said
in
this
instance
even
brahma
could
not
restore
to
life
of
what
account
are
we
then
do
you
now
perform
her
funeral
rites
we
are
having
said
this
the
conjurers
went
away
and
the
brahman
took
the
corpse
away
burnt
it
in
the
place
for
such
rites
and
went
now
after
he
had
gone
those
three
youths
acted
in
this
wise
one
of
them
picked
up
and
fastened
together
her
charred
bones
and
becoming
a
religious
mendicant
went
forth
to
wander
from
forest
to
forest
the
second
having
tied
her
ashes
up
in
a
bundle
built
a
hut
and
began
living
on
that
very
spot
the
third
became
a
devotee
furnished
himself
with
a
wallet
and
and
set
out
to
wander
from
land
to
land
one
day
he
went
to
a
brahman
s
house
in
some
country
for
food
the
resident
brahman
on
seeing
him
began
to
say
very
well
eat
food
here
on
hearing
this
he
sat
down
there
when
the
food
was
ready
he
had
his
hands
and
feet
washed
and
took
and
seated
him
in
the
square
place
where
the
food
was
cooked
and
himself
sat
down
near
him
and
his
wife
came
to
serve
out
the
food
some
was
served
some
remained
when
her
youngest
son
cried
and
seized
the
border
of
his
mother
s
mantle
she
was
trying
to
make
him
let
it
go
but
he
would
not
and
as
much
as
she
tried
to
soothe
him
he
but
cried
the
more
and
became
more
obstinate
on
this
the
brahman
s
wife
becoming
angry
took
up
the
child
and
threw
him
into
the
burning
the
child
was
burnt
to
the
word
grihasti
means
properly
a
brahman
who
is
settled
in
a
house
and
performs
the
duties
of
the
father
of
a
family
when
the
brahman
the
guest
witnessed
this
occurrence
he
rose
up
without
eating
anything
then
the
master
of
the
house
said
why
do
you
not
eat
he
replied
how
can
one
partake
of
food
in
his
house
where
a
diabolical
deed
has
been
on
hearing
this
the
householder
arose
and
going
to
another
part
of
his
house
brought
a
book
on
the
science
of
restoring
to
life
took
a
charm
from
it
muttered
some
prayers
and
brought
his
son
back
to
life
then
that
brahman
seeing
this
wonder
began
to
ponder
in
his
mind
if
this
book
were
to
fall
into
my
hands
i
too
could
restore
my
beloved
to
having
made
up
his
mind
on
this
point
he
ate
the
food
and
tarried
there
to
be
brief
when
night
came
on
after
some
time
all
partook
of
supper
and
went
and
lay
down
in
their
respective
places
and
were
chatting
together
on
one
subject
or
another
the
brahman
too
went
and
lay
down
apart
but
kept
lying
awake
when
he
thought
that
the
night
was
far
advanced
and
all
had
gone
to
sleep
he
arose
quietly
softly
entered
his
host
s
room
took
that
book
and
decamped
and
in
the
course
of
several
days
he
arrived
at
the
place
where
he
the
father
had
burnt
the
brahman
s
daughter
he
found
the
other
two
brahmans
there
also
sitting
and
conversing
together
those
two
also
recognising
him
approached
and
met
him
and
inquired
saying
brother
you
have
wandered
from
land
to
land
it
is
true
but
tell
us
have
you
learned
any
science
as
well
he
said
i
have
learned
the
science
of
restoring
the
dead
to
as
soon
as
they
heard
this
they
said
if
you
have
learned
this
restore
our
beloved
to
he
replied
make
a
heap
of
the
ashes
and
bones
and
i
will
restore
it
to
they
gathered
together
the
ashes
and
bones
then
he
took
a
charm
out
of
the
book
and
muttered
prayers
the
girl
rose
up
alive
thereupon
cupid
so
blinded
the
three
of
them
that
they
began
wrangling
among
having
related
so
much
of
the
tale
the
sprite
said
o
king
tell
me
this
to
whom
did
that
woman
by
right
belong
or
whose
wife
was
she
king
vikram
replied
to
him
who
built
the
hut
and
stayed
the
sprite
said
if
he
had
not
preserved
the
bones
how
could
she
have
been
restored
to
life
and
if
the
other
had
not
returned
instructed
in
the
science
how
could
he
have
restored
her
to
life
the
king
made
answer
thus
he
who
had
preserved
her
bones
occupied
the
place
of
her
son
and
he
who
gave
her
life
became
as
it
were
her
father
hence
she
became
the
wife
of
him
who
built
a
hut
and
remained
there
with
the
on
hearing
this
answer
the
sprite
went
again
and
suspended
himself
on
that
tree
the
king
too
arrived
close
at
his
heels
and
having
bound
him
and
placed
him
on
his
shoulder
started
off
with
him
again
tale
iii
the
sprite
said
o
king
there
is
a
city
named
bardwãn
wherein
is
a
king
named
rüpsen
it
happened
one
day
that
the
king
was
seated
in
an
apartment
adjoining
the
gate
of
his
palace
when
from
without
the
gate
the
loud
voices
of
some
people
reached
him
the
king
said
who
is
at
the
gate
and
what
noise
is
that
taking
place
upon
this
the
gatekeeper
replied
great
king
you
have
asked
a
fine
question
knowing
this
to
be
the
gate
of
a
wealthy
personage
numbers
of
persons
of
all
kinds
come
and
sit
at
it
for
the
sake
of
money
and
converse
on
a
variety
of
topics
this
is
on
hearing
this
the
king
kept
silent
in
the
meanwhile
a
traveller
named
birbar
a
rajput
came
from
the
south
to
the
king
s
gate
in
the
hope
of
obtaining
service
the
after
ascertaining
his
circumstances
said
to
the
king
your
majesty
an
armed
man
has
come
in
the
hope
of
entering
your
service
and
stands
at
the
door
with
your
majesty
s
leave
he
shall
come
before
having
heard
this
the
king
gave
the
order
to
bring
him
in
he
went
and
brought
him
then
the
king
asked
o
rãjpüt
how
much
shall
i
allow
thee
for
daily
expenses
on
hearing
this
birbar
said
give
me
a
thousand
about
oz
of
gold
daily
and
i
shall
be
able
to
the
king
enquired
how
many
persons
are
there
with
you
dependent
on
you
he
replied
first
my
wife
second
a
son
third
a
daughter
fourth
myself
there
is
no
fifth
person
with
hearing
him
speak
thus
all
the
people
of
the
king
s
court
turned
away
their
faces
and
began
laughing
but
the
king
began
to
consider
why
he
had
asked
for
a
large
sum
of
money
ultimately
he
thought
it
out
in
his
own
mind
that
a
vast
sum
of
money
given
away
will
some
day
prove
of
advantage
coming
to
this
conclusion
he
sent
for
his
treasurer
and
said
give
this
birbar
a
thousand
of
gold
daily
from
my
on
hearing
this
order
birbar
took
a
thousand
of
gold
for
that
day
and
brought
it
to
the
place
where
he
was
staying
and
dividing
it
into
two
parts
distributed
one
half
among
the
brahmans
and
again
dividing
the
remaining
half
into
two
parts
distributed
one
portion
thereof
among
pilgrims
devotees
the
worshippers
of
vishnu
and
religious
mendicants
and
of
the
one
part
which
remained
he
had
food
cooked
and
fed
the
poor
and
what
remained
over
he
consumed
himself
in
this
way
he
with
his
wife
and
children
used
regularly
to
subsist
and
every
night
he
used
to
take
his
sword
and
shield
and
go
and
mount
guard
over
the
king
s
couch
and
when
the
king
roused
from
sleep
used
to
call
out
is
any
one
in
waiting
then
he
used
to
answer
birbar
is
in
attendance
what
may
be
your
commands
thus
answered
he
whenever
the
king
called
out
and
thereupon
whatever
he
the
king
ordered
to
be
done
he
in
this
way
through
eagerness
for
wealth
he
used
to
keep
awake
the
whole
night
long
nay
whether
eating
drinking
sleeping
sitting
still
or
moving
about
that
is
to
say
during
the
whole
hours
eight
watches
he
used
to
keep
his
lord
in
mind
the
practice
is
that
if
one
person
sells
another
this
one
becomes
sold
but
a
servant
by
entering
service
sells
and
when
sold
he
becomes
a
dependant
and
once
dependant
he
has
no
prospect
of
peace
it
is
notorious
that
however
clever
wise
and
learned
he
may
be
still
when
he
is
in
his
master
s
presence
he
remains
quite
silent
like
a
dumb
person
through
fear
so
long
as
he
is
aloof
from
him
he
is
at
rest
on
this
account
it
is
that
the
learned
say
to
perform
the
duties
of
a
servant
is
more
difficult
than
to
perform
religious
to
the
story
it
is
related
that
one
day
the
weeping
voice
of
a
woman
chanced
to
come
at
from
the
on
hearing
it
the
king
called
out
is
any
one
in
waiting
birbar
instantly
answered
i
am
here
your
thereupon
the
king
gave
him
this
order
go
to
the
spot
whence
yon
weeping
voice
of
a
woman
proceeds
and
enquire
of
her
the
cause
of
her
weeping
and
return
having
given
him
this
order
the
king
began
to
say
to
himself
whosoever
desires
to
test
his
servant
should
order
him
to
do
things
in
season
and
out
of
season
if
he
execute
his
order
know
that
he
is
worth
something
and
if
he
object
be
sure
that
he
is
worthless
and
in
this
same
way
prove
brethren
and
friends
in
days
of
adversity
and
a
wife
in
in
fine
on
receiving
this
order
he
took
the
direction
whence
the
sound
of
her
weeping
proceeded
and
the
king
also
after
dressing
himself
in
black
followed
him
secretly
for
the
purpose
of
observing
his
courage
in
this
interval
birbar
arrived
there
what
does
he
behold
in
the
but
a
beautiful
woman
lavishly
decked
with
jewels
from
head
to
foot
crying
aloud
and
bitterly
at
one
moment
she
was
dancing
at
another
leaping
at
another
running
and
not
a
tear
in
her
eyes
and
while
repeatedly
beating
her
head
and
crying
out
alas
alas
she
kept
dashing
herself
on
the
ground
seeing
this
her
condition
birbar
asked
why
art
thou
crying
and
beating
thyself
so
violently
who
art
thou
and
what
trouble
has
befallen
thee
on
this
she
said
i
am
the
royal
birbar
said
why
art
thou
weeping
upon
this
she
began
relating
her
case
to
birbar
saying
impious
acts
acts
such
as
a
shüdra
performs
are
committed
in
the
king
s
house
whence
misfortune
will
find
admission
therein
and
i
shall
depart
thence
after
the
lapse
of
a
month
the
king
will
suffer
much
affliction
and
die
this
is
the
sorrow
which
makes
me
weep
further
i
have
enjoyed
great
happiness
in
his
house
and
hence
this
regret
and
this
matter
will
in
nowise
prove
birbar
then
asked
is
there
any
such
remedy
for
it
whereby
the
king
may
escape
and
live
a
hundred
years
she
said
towards
the
east
at
a
distance
of
four
eight
miles
is
a
temple
sacred
to
the
goddess
devi
if
you
will
cut
off
your
son
s
head
with
your
own
hand
and
offer
it
to
that
goddess
then
the
king
will
reign
a
hundred
years
precisely
as
he
now
reigns
and
no
harm
of
any
kind
will
befall
the
as
soon
as
he
had
heard
these
words
birbar
went
home
and
the
king
also
followed
him
to
be
brief
when
he
got
home
he
awoke
his
wife
and
minutely
related
the
whole
story
to
her
on
hearing
the
circumstances
she
roused
the
son
alone
but
the
daughter
also
awoke
then
that
woman
said
to
her
boy
son
by
sacrificing
your
head
the
king
s
life
will
be
saved
and
the
government
too
will
when
the
boy
heard
this
he
said
mother
in
the
first
place
it
is
your
command
in
the
second
it
is
for
my
lord
s
service
thirdly
if
this
body
come
of
use
to
a
deity
nothing
in
the
world
is
better
for
me
in
my
opinion
than
this
it
is
not
right
to
delay
any
longer
now
in
this
business
there
is
a
saying
if
one
have
a
son
to
have
him
under
control
a
body
free
from
disease
science
such
that
one
benefits
thereby
a
friend
prudent
a
wife
submissive
if
these
five
things
are
obtainable
by
man
they
are
the
bestowers
of
happiness
and
the
averters
of
trouble
if
a
servant
be
unwilling
a
king
parsimonious
a
friend
insincere
and
a
wife
disobedient
these
four
things
are
the
banishers
of
peace
and
the
promoters
of
birbar
again
addressed
his
wife
saying
if
thou
wilt
willingly
give
up
thy
child
i
will
take
him
away
and
sacrifice
him
for
the
she
replied
saying
i
have
no
concern
with
son
daughter
brother
kinsfolk
mother
father
or
any
one
from
you
it
is
that
my
happiness
proceeds
and
in
the
moral
code
too
it
is
thus
written
a
woman
is
purified
neither
by
offerings
nor
by
religious
offices
her
religion
consists
in
serving
and
honouring
her
husband
no
matter
whether
he
be
lame
maimed
in
the
hands
dumb
deaf
blind
of
both
eyes
blind
of
one
eye
a
leper
of
whatever
kind
he
be
if
she
perform
any
description
of
virtuous
action
in
the
world
while
she
does
not
obey
her
husband
she
will
fall
into
his
son
said
father
the
man
by
whom
his
master
s
business
is
accomplished
continuing
to
live
in
the
world
is
attended
with
advantage
and
in
this
there
is
advantage
in
both
then
his
daughter
said
if
the
mother
give
poison
to
the
daughter
and
the
father
sell
the
son
and
the
king
seize
everything
then
whose
protection
shall
we
seek
the
four
deliberating
with
one
another
somewhat
after
the
above
fashion
went
to
the
temple
of
devi
the
king
also
secretly
followed
them
when
birbar
arrived
there
he
entered
the
temple
paid
his
adoration
to
devi
and
joined
his
hands
in
supplication
and
said
o
devi
grant
that
by
the
sacrificing
of
my
son
the
king
may
live
a
hundred
saying
so
much
he
struck
such
a
blow
with
the
sword
that
his
son
s
head
fell
upon
the
ground
on
witnessing
her
brother
s
death
the
daughter
struck
a
blow
with
the
sword
on
her
own
neck
so
that
her
head
and
body
fell
asunder
seeing
her
son
and
daughter
dead
birbar
s
wife
struck
such
a
stroke
with
the
sword
on
her
own
neck
that
her
head
was
severed
from
her
body
further
seeing
the
death
of
those
three
birbar
reflecting
in
his
mind
began
to
say
when
my
is
dead
for
whose
sake
shall
i
retain
service
and
to
whom
shall
i
give
the
gold
i
receive
from
the
king
having
reflected
thus
he
struck
such
a
blow
with
the
sword
on
his
own
neck
that
his
head
was
severed
from
his
body
again
beholding
the
death
of
these
four
the
king
sajd
to
himself
for
my
sake
the
lives
of
his
family
have
perished
accursed
is
it
any
longer
to
govern
a
realm
for
which
the
whole
family
of
one
is
destroyed
while
one
holds
sovereignty
it
is
no
virtue
thus
to
having
deliberated
thus
the
king
was
on
the
point
of
killing
himself
with
the
sword
in
the
meantime
however
devi
came
and
seized
his
hand
and
said
son
i
am
well
pleased
at
thy
courage
and
will
grant
thee
whatever
boon
thou
mayest
ask
of
the
king
said
mother
if
thou
art
pleased
restore
all
these
four
to
devi
said
this
same
shall
take
place
and
on
the
instant
of
saying
it
bhawãni
brought
the
water
of
life
from
the
nether
regions
and
restored
all
four
to
life
after
that
the
king
bestowed
half
his
kingdom
on
having
related
so
much
the
sprite
said
blessed
is
the
servant
who
did
not
grudge
his
life
and
that
of
his
family
for
his
master
s
sake
and
happy
is
the
king
who
showed
no

and
the
king
and
queen
entered
into
conversation
saying

days
after

were
seated
conversing
with
each
other
when
the
parrot
began
to
talk
to
the
saying
sexual
intercourse
is
the
essence
of
all
bliss
in
this
world
and
he
who
on
being
born
into
the
world
has
not
enjoyed
sexual
intercourse
his
life
has
been
passed
in
vain
hence
do
thou
let
me
copulate
with

hearing
this
the
said
i
have
no
desire
for

thereupon
he
inquired
why
the
said
the
male
sex
are
sinful
irreligious
deceivers
and
hearing
this
the
parrot
said
the
female
sex
too
are
deceitful
false
stupid
avaricious
creatures
and
when
the
two
commenced
wrangling
in
this
manner
the
king
asked
why
are
you
two
quarrelling
with
each
other
the
replied
great
king
the
male
sex
are
and
and
hence
i
have
no
desire
to
have
a
male
partner
your
majesty
i
will
tell
you
a
tale
do
you
be
pleased
to
hearken
for
such
as
i
describe
them
are
the
maina
s
story
there
was
a
city
named
ilãpur
and
a
merchant
named
mahãdhan
dwelt
there
who
could
not
get
a
family
on
this
account
he
was
continually
making
pilgrimages
and
keeping
fasts
and
always
hearing
the
purãnas
read
and
he
used
to
give
gifts
largely
to
the
brahmans
in
fine
after
some
considerable
time
by
god
s
will
a
son
was
born
in
that
merchant
s
house
he
celebrated
the
event
with
great
pomp
and
gave
large
gifts
to
the
brahmans
and
bards
and
also
gave
away
a
good
deal
to
the
hungry
thirsty
and
indigent
when
he
reached
the
age
of
five
years
he
placed
him
in
school
for
instruction
he
used
to
leave
home
for
the
purpose
of
learning
but
used
to
gamble
with
the
boys
when
he
got
after
some
time
the
merchant
died
and
he
the
son
becoming
his
own
master
used
to
spend
his
days
in
gambling
and
his
nights
in
fornication
thus
he
dissipated
his
whole
wealth
in
a
few
years
and
having
no
alternative
quitted
his
country
and
proceeding
from
bad
to
worse
arrived
at
the
city
of
chandrapur
in
that
place
dwelt
a
merchant
named
hemgupt
who
possessed
much
wealth
he
went
to
him
and
mentioned
his
father
s
name
and
circumstances
he
the
merchant
felt
instant
pleasure
on
hearing
these
accounts
and
rising
and
embracing
him
inquired
how
came
you
here
then
he
said
i
had
engaged
a
vessel
and
set
out
for
an
island
to
trade
and
having
arrived
there
and
sold
the
goods
had
taken
in
other
goods
as
cargo
and
left
with
the
vessel
for
my
own
land
when
suddenly
so
violent
a
storm
arose
that
the
ship
was
wrecked
and
i
was
left
seated
on
a
plank
and
so
drifting
on
i
have
reached
this
shore
but
i
feel
a
sense
of
shame
at
having
lost
all
my
property
and
wealth
how
can
i
now
return
and
show
my
face
to
my
in
this
state
to
be
brief
when
he
uttered
such
words
in
his
presence
he
the
merchant
too
began
to
think
to
himself
god
has
relieved
me
of
any
anxiety
without
any
effort
of
my
own
i
sitting
at
home
now
a
coincidence
like
this
occurs
through
the
mercy
of
god
alone
it
behoves
me
to
make
no
delay
now
the
best
thing
to
be
done
is
to
give
my
girl
in
marriage
to
him
whatever
is
done
now
is
best
as
for
the
morrow
who
knows
what
it
may
bring
forth
forming
this
grand
design
in
his
mind
he
came
to
his
wife
and
began
to
say
a
merchant
s
son
has
arrived
if
you
approve
we
will
give
ratnãvati
in
marriage
to
she
too
was
delighted
on
hearing
this
and
said
sir
merchant
when
god
brings
about
a
coincidence
like
this
then
alone
does
it
occur
for
the
desire
of
our
hearts
has
been
obtained
without
our
bestirring
ourselves
in
the
least
we
sitting
quietly
at
home
hence
it
is
best
not
to
delay
but
quickly
send
for
the
family

the
auspicious
moment
determined
and
give
her
away
in
hereupon

some
days
before

hands
of
a
betrothed
couple
are
stained
yellow
with
turmeric
to
proceed
after
some
days
he
said
to
the
merchant

daughter
a
long
time
has
passed
since
i
arrived
in
your
land
and
no
news
of
my
household

and
my
mind
remains
troubled
in
consequence

to
your
mother

in
such
a
manner

to
her
husband
and
said
your
asks

to
return
on
hearing
this
the
merchant
said
very
well

will
let
him
go
for
we
can
exercise
no
authority
over
a
stranger
s
son
we
will
do
that
alone
wherein

pleasure
having
said
this
he
sent
for
his
daughter
and
asked
will

go
to
your
s
or
remain
at
your
mother

speak
your
own
at
this
she
blushed
and
gave
no
answer
but
returned
to
her
husband
and
said
my
parents
have
declared
that
they
will
do
that
wherein
your
pleasure
consists
don
t
you
leave
me
to
be
brief
the
merchant
summoned
his
loaded
him
with
wealth
and
dismissed
him
and
allowed
his
daughter
to
accompany
him
in
a
litter
together
with
a
female
servant
after
this
he
set
out
from
when
he
reached
a
certain
jungle
he
said
to
the
merchant
s
daughter
there
is
great
danger
here
if
you
will
take
off
your
jewels
and
give
them
to
me
i
will
fasten
them
round
my
waist
when
we
come
to
a
town

can
put
them
on

no
sooner
heard
this
than
she
took
off
all
her
ornaments
and
he
having
taken
them
and
sent
away
the
bearers
of
the
litter
killed
the
and
threw
her
into
a
well
and
pushing
her
his

into
a
well

went
off
to
his

country
with
all
the
in
the
meantime
a
traveller
came
along
that
road
and
hearing
the
sound
of
weeping
stopped
and
began
to
say
to
himself
how
comes
the
weeping
voice
of
a
human
bring
to
be
heard
in
this
jungle
having
reflected
thus
he
proceeded
in
the
direction
of
the
sound
of
the
crying
and
perceived
a
well
on
looking
into
it
what
does
he
behold
but
a
woman
weeping
then
he
took
out
the
woman
and
commenced
questioning
her
on
her
circumstances
saying
who
art
thou
and
how
didst
thou
fall
into
this
well
on
hearing
this
she
said

daughter
of

the
merchant
and

this
the
traveller
took
her
along
with
him
and
left
her
at
the
merchant

she
went
to
her
parents
they
at
the
sight
of
her
began
enquiring
what

happened
to
thee
she
said
robbers
came
and
plundered
us
on
the
road
and
after
killing
the
servant
and
casting
her
into
a
well
pushed
me
into
a
dry
well
and
bound
and
carried
off
my
husband
together
with
my
jewels
when
they
began
demanding
more
money
he
said
to
them

now
left
beyond

the
merchant
gave
her
other
ornaments
in
place
of
all
that

disappeared
and
comforted
and
consoled
her
greatly
and
the
merchant

son
also
having
reached
home
and
sold
the
jewels

his
days
and
nights
in
the
company
of
loose
women
and
in
gambling
so
much
so
that
all
his
money
was
expended
then
he
came
to
want
bread
at
last
when
he
began
to
suffer
extreme
misery
he
one
day
bethought
himself
of
going
to
his
s
and
pretending
that
a
grandson
had
been
born
to
him
and
that
he
had
come
to
congratulate
him
on
the

having
determined
on
this
in
his
mind

of
several
days

arrived
there
when
he
was
about
to
enter
the
house
his
wife
saw
from
the
front
that
her
husband
was
coming
and
said
to
herself

must
not
be
allowed
to
turn
back
through
any
apprehension
he
may
upon
this
she
approached
him
and

thus
she
entered
the
house

went
to
the
merchant

rose
and
embraced
him
and
questioned
him
on
all
that
had
befallen
him
he
related
everything
precisely
as
his
wife
had
instructed
him
to
rejoicings
took
place
throughout
the
house
then
the
merchant
after
providing
him
with
the
means
of
bathing
and
placing
food
before
him
and
after
ministering
much
comfort

there
in

after
several
days

lay
with
him
one
night
with
her
jewels

a
wound
on

put
him
on
the
track
to
her
house
he
said
i
will
come
at
the
companion
came
and
informed
the
merchant
s
daughter
that
he
had
promised
to
come
at
night
when
she
heard
this
jayshri
said
to
her
companion
you
go
home
when
he
arrives
let
me
know
and
i
will
also
come
when
free
to
leave
on
hearing
her
words
her
companion
went
home
and
seating
herself
at
the
door
began
watching
for
his
coming
in
the
meantime
he
arrived
she
seated
him
in
the
doorway
saying
you
sit
here
i
will
go
and
give
notice
of
your
and
she
came
to
jayshri
and
said
your
sweetheart
has
on
hearing
this
she
said
wait
awhile
let
the
household
go
to
sleep
and
then
i
will
and
so
after
some
delay
when
it
was
near
midnight
and
all
had
gone
to
sleep
then
she
arose
softly
and
accompanied
her
and
arrived
there
in
a
very
short
time
and
the
two
met
in
her
house
without
restraint
when
nearly
an
hour
and
a
half
of
night
remained
she
rose
and
returned
home
and
went
quietly
to
sleep
and
he
also
went
to
his
house
at
lit
four
a
ghari
is
equal
to
minutes
and
hence
the
exact
time
would
be
six
minutes
more
than
an
hour
and
a
many
days
passed
thus
at
last
her
husband
too
returned
from
foreign
parts
to
his
s
house
when
she
beheld
her
husband
she
became
troubled
in
mind
and
said
to
her
companion
such
is
my
anxiety
what
shall
i
do
whither
shall
i
go
sleep
hunger
thirst
all
are
forgotten
nothing
is
agreeable
to
me
neither
hot
nor
cold
pleases
me
and
she
told
her
the
whole
state
of
her
heart
to
be
brief
she
got
through
the
day
somehow
or
other
but
at
night
when
her
husband
had
finished
supper
his
had
a
bed
made
for
him
in
a
separate
building
and
sent
word
to
him
to
go
and
take
repose
while
she
said
to
her
daughter
you
go
and
do
your
duty
to
your
she
turned
up
her
nose
and
knitted
her
brows
on
hearing
this
and
remained
silent
on
this
her
mother
rebuked
her
sharply
and
sent
her
off
to
him
being
powerless
she
went
there
but
lay
on
the
bed
with
her
face
turned
away
the
more
he
kept
addressing
her
in
words
of
tenderness
the
more
vexed
would
she
become
on
this
he
presented
her
with
all
the
various
descriptions
of
apparel
and
the
jewels
which
he
had
brought
for
her
from
different
places
and
said
wear
then
in
truth
she
became
still
more
vexed
and
frowned
and
turned
away
her
face
and
he
too
went
to
sleep
in
despair
for
he
was
fatigued
with
the
journey
to
her
however
thinking
of
her
lover
sleep
came
when
she
thought
that
he
was
in
an
unconscious
sleep
she
arose
softly
and
leaving
him
asleep
went
fearlessly
in
the
dark
night
to
the
abode
of
her
lover
and
a
thief
seeing
her
on
the
way
thought
to
himself
where
can
this
woman
be
going
alone
with
her
jewels
on
at
this
midnight
thus
soliloquising
he
followed
her
in
short
she
managed
somehow
to
reach
her
lover
s
house
now
there
a
snake
had
bitten
and
left
him
he
was
lying
dead
she
thought
he
was
sleeping
being
as
it
was
consumed
with
the
fire
of
separation
she
clasped
him
to
her
without
restraint
and
began
caressing
him
and
the
thief
from
a
distance
was
watching
the
an
evil
spirit
too
was
seated
on
a
pipal
tree
there
looking
on
at
the
scene
all
at
once
it
came
into
his
mind
to
enter
his
dead
body
and
have
carnal
intercourse
with
her
having
resolved
on
this
he
entered
the
body
and
after
having
intercourse
with
her
bit
off
her
nose
with
his
teeth
and
went
and
sat
on
the
same
tree
the
thief
observed
all
these
occurrences
and
she
in
despair
went
as
she
was
all
stained
with
blood
to
her
companion
and
related
all
that
had
happened
whereupon
her
companion
said
go
quickly
to
thy
husband
ere
yet
the
sun
rise
and
arrived
there
weep
aloud
and
bitterly
if
any
one
should
question
thee
say
he
has
cut
off
my
she
went
thither
on
the
instant
of
hearing
her
companion
s
words
and
commenced
weeping
and
wailing
excessively
hearing
the
noise
of
her
weeping
all
her
relations
came
and
lo
she
had
no
nose
was
sitting
noseless
then
they
exclaimed
o
you
shameless
wicked
pitiless
mad
wretch
why
have
you
bitten
off
her
nose
without
any
fault
on
her
part
he
too
became
alarmed
on
witnessing
this
farce
and
began
to
say
to
himself
trust
not
a
woman
a
black
snake
an
armed
man
an
enemy
and
fear
the
wiles
of
a
woman
what
can
an
eminent
poet
not
describe
what
does
he
not
know
who
has
acquired
supernatural
power
what
absurd
nonsense
does
a
drunkard
not
chatter
what
can
a
woman
not
accomplish
true
it
is
that
the
defects
of
horses
the
thunder
of
the
clouds
the
wiles
of
woman
and
the
destiny
of
man
these
things
even
the
gods
do
not
comprehend
what
power
has
man
then
to
understand
them
in
the
meantime
her
father
gave
information
of
the
occurrence
to
the
city
magistrate
policemen
came
from
the
station
there
and
bound
and
brought
him
before
the
magistrate
the
magistrate
of
the
city
gave
notice
to
the
king
the
king
having
sent
for
him
and
questioned
him
about
the
case
he
declared
he
knew
nothing
and
on
his
summoning
the
merchant
s
daughter
and
interrogating
her
she
replied
your
majesty
when
you
see
plainly
what
has
happened
why
do
you
question
me
then
the
king
said
to
him
what
punishment
shall
i
inflict
on
thee
on
hearing
this
he
replied
do
unto
me
whatever
you
deem
the
king
said
away
with
him
and
impale
him
on
receiving
the
king
s
order
the
people
took
him
away
to
impale
observe
the
coincidence
that
thief
was
also
standing
there
looking
on
at
the
scene
when
he
was
convinced
that
this
man
was
about
to
be
unjustly
put
to
death
he
raised
a
cry
for
justice
the
king
summoned
him
and
asked
who
art
thou
he
said
great
king
i
am
a
thief
and
this
man
is
innocent
his
blood
is
about
to
be
unjustly
shed
you
have
not
given
judgment
at
all
hereupon
the
king
summoned
him
the
husband
also
and
questioned
the
thief
saying
declare
the
truth
on
thy
honour
what
are
the
facts
of
this
case
the
thief
then
gave
a
detailed
account
of
the
circumstances
and
the
king
too
comprehended
them
thoroughly
ultimately
he
sent
attendants
and
had
the
woman
s
nose
brought
from
the
mouth
of
her
lover
who
was
lying
dead
and
inspected
it
then
he
was
assured
that
the
man
was
guiltless
and
the
thief
truthful
hereupon
the
thief
said
to
cherish
the
good
and
punish
has
from
of
old
been
a
duty
of
after
relating
so
much
of
the
tale
the
parrot
chürãman
said
great
king
such
embodiments
of
all
crime
are
women
the
king
having
had
the
woman
s
face
blackened
and
her
head
shaved
had
her
mounted
on
an
ass
and
taken
round
the
city
and
then
set
at
liberty
and
after
giving
to
the
thief
and
the
merchant
s
son
he
allowed
them
to
having
related
so
much
of
the
story
the
sprite
said
o
king
to
which
of
these
two
does
the
greater
guilt
attach
then
king
bir
vikramãjit
said
to
the
on
this
the
sprite
said
how
so
on
hearing
this
the
king
said
however
depraved
a
man
may
be
still
some
sense
of
right
and
wrong
remains
in
him
but
a
woman
does
not
give
a
thought
to
right
and
wrong
hence
great
guilt
attached
to
the
hearing
these
words
the
sprite
went
again
and
hung
himself
on
the
same
tree
the
king
went
again
and
took
him
down
from
the
tree
tied
him
up
in
a
bundle
placed
him
on
his
shoulder
and
carried
him
away
tale
the
sprite
said
o
king
there
is
a
city
named
ujjain
of
which
mahãbal
was
king
now
he
had
an
envoy
named
haridãs
the
name
of
that
envoy
s
daughter
was
mahãdevï
she
was
extremely
beautiful
when
she
became
marriageable
her
father
thought
that
he
ought
to
seek
a
husband
for
her
and
give
her
in
marriage
in
short
the
girl
one
day
said
to
her
father
father
give
me
in
marriage
to
some
one
who
is
possessed
of
all
accomplishments
on
this
he
said
i
will
give
thee
to
one
who
is
acquainted
with
all
one
day
subsequent
to
this
the
king
summoned
haridãs
and
said
there
is
in
the
south
a
king
named
harichand
go
and
ask
after
his
health
and
welfare
for
me
and
bring
me
news
on
receiving
the
king
s
command
he
took
leave
and
arriving
at
that
king
s
after
some
days
delivered
to
him
the
whole
message
of
his
royal
master
and
took
up
his
permanent
abode
near
that
to
be
brief
it
happened
one
day
that
the
king
questioned
him
saying
haridãs
has
the
iron
age
the
fourth
age
of
the
world
or
the
age
of
vice
begun
yet
or
not
on
this
he
put
his
hands
together
and
said
your
majesty
we
are
already
in
the
iron
age
the
iron
age
is
present
for
falsehood
is
rife
in
the
world
and
truth
has
decreased
people
utter
soft
words
to
one
s
face
while
they
harbour
deceit
in
their
hearts
virtue
has
vanished
vice
has
increased
the
earth
has
begun
to
yield
less
fruit
kings
have
begun
levying
contributions
by
violence
brahmans
have
become
covetous
women
have
abandoned
modesty
the
son
obeys
not
the
father
s
command
brother
trusts
not

friendship
has
departed
from
amongst
friends
faith
is
no
longer
found
in
masters
and
servants
have
cast
aside
the
duty
they
owe
to
masters
and
every
description
of
impropriety
meets
the
when
he
had
said
all
this
to
the
king
his
majesty
arose
and
went
into
the
private
apartments
and
he
the
envoy
came
and
sat
down
in
his
own
place
in
the
meantime
a
brahman
s
son
came
to
him
and
said
i
have
come
to
solicit
something
of
on
hearing
this
he
said
what
request
have
you
to
make
mention
he
replied
give
me
your
daughter
in
haridãs
said
i
will
give
her
to
him
in
whom
all
accomplishments
hearing
this
he
rejoined
i
am
acquainted
with
all
the
then
said
the
envoy
show
me
something
of
thy
knowledge
i
shall
thus
be
able
to
judge
whether
thou
art
versed
in
hereupon
the
brahman
s
son
said
i
have
made
a
car
which
has
this
marvellous
property
that
it
will
convey
you
in
a
moment
to
any
place
you
may
wish
to
go
then
haridãs
replied
bring
the
car
to
me
in
the
in
fine
he
brought
the
car
to
haridãs
early
in
the
morning
then
the
two
mounted
the
car
and
arrived
in
the
city
of
ujjain
here
however
it
so
happened
that
previous
to
his
arrival
another
brahman
s
son
had
come
and
said
to
his
eldest
son
give
me
your
sister
in
marriage
and
he
also
had
replied
saying
i
will
give
her
to
one
who
is
learned
in
all
the
sciences
and
that
brahman
s
son
too
had
said
i
am
acquainted
with
all
knowledge
and
on
hearing
this
he
had
said
to
you
will
i
give
another
brahman
s
son
had
said
to
the
girl
s
mother
give
me
your
she
too
had
given
him
the
same
answer
i
will
give
my
girl
to
him
who
is
acquainted
with
all
that
brahman
s
son
also
had
replied
i
am
acquainted
with
the
whole
body
of
science
contained
in
the
and
can
shoot
an
arrow
which
will
hit
an
object
which
is
merely
heard
and
not
on
hearing
this
she
too
had
said
i
consent
and
will
give
her
to
in
short
all
the
three
suitors
had
come
and
met
together
in
this
way
haridãs
began
to
think
to
himself
one
girl
and
three
suitors
to
whom
shall
i
give
her
and
to
whom
not
he
was
troubled
with
this
thought
when
a
demon
came
at
night
and
carried
off
the
girl
to
the
summit
of
a
mountain
in
the
vindhyã
range
it
is
said
that
too
much
of
anything
is
not
good
sïtã
was
exceedingly
beautiful
and
rãvan
carried
her
off
king
bali
gave
gifts
largely
he
became
indigent
rãvan
utterly
ruined
his
family
by
his
excessive
in
brief
when
mom
arrived
and
none
of
the
household
found
the
girl
they
began
to
fancy
all
sorts
of
things
and
the
three
suitors
too
on
bearing
of
the
matter
came
there
one
of
them
was
a
wise
man
him
haridãs
questioned
saying
o
wise
man
tell
me
whither
the
girl
has
gone
he
considered
for
a
moment
or
so
and
said
a
demon
has
carried
off
your
daughter
and
lodged
her
on
a
on
this
the
second
said
i
will
kill
the
demon
and
bring
her
then
again
the
third
said
mount
my
car
and
bring
her
on
the
instant
of
hearing
this
he
mounted
the
car
reached
the
place
slew
the
demon
and
forthwith
brought
her
back
and
then
they
began
quarrelling
with
one
another
thereupon
the
father
pondered
over
the
matter
in
his
mind
and
said
all
of
them
have
conferred
obligations
on
me
to
whom
shall
i
give
her
and
to
whom
not
having
related
so
much
of
the
story
the
sprite
said
now
king
vikram
whose
wife
out
of
the
three
did
the
maiden
become
he
replied
she
became
the
wife
of
him
who
slew
the
demon
and
brought
her
the
sprite
said
the
good
qualities
of
all
were
on
a
par
how
came
she
to
become
his
wife
the
king
replied
the
other
two
simply
conferred
favours
for
which
they
were
recompensed
but
this
one
fought
with
and
slew
him
the
demon
and
brought
her
away
hence
she
became
his
on
hearing
this
the
sprite
went
again
to
the
same
tree
and
suspended
himself
on
it
and
the
king
too
went
immediately
bound
the
sprite
placed
him
on
his
shoulder
and
carried
him
off
as
before
tale
vi
again
the
sprite
said
o
king
there
is
a
city
named
dharmpur
of
which
dharmshil
was
king
and
his
minister
s
name
was
andhak
he
said
one
day
to
the
king
your
majesty
build
a
temple
and
place
an
image
of
devi
therein
and
pay
constant
adoration
thereto
for
this
is
said
in
the
to
possess
great
thereupon
the
king
had
a
temple
built
and
the
image
of
devi
placed
in
it
and
began
offering
adoration
after
the
manner
prescribed
by
the
vedas
and
he
would
not
drink
water
without
having
when
a
considerable
time
had
passed
thus
the
minister
said
one
day
great
king
the
saying
is
well
known
the
house
of
a
sonless
man
is
empty
a
fool
s
mind
is
empty
and
everything
pertaining
to
an
indigent
person
is
on
hearing
these
words
the
king
went
to
the
temple
of
devi
and
joining
his
hands
in
supplication
began
to
extol
her
saying
o
devi
brahma
vishnü
rudra
indra
await
thy
bidding
the
livelong
day
and
thou
it
was
who
didst
seize
the
demons
chand
mund
raktbij
and
slaying
the
evil
spirits
relieved
the
earth
of
its
burthen
and
wheresoever
trouble
has
befallen
thy
worshippers
there
thou
hast
gone
and
aided
them
and
in
this
hope
i
have
approached
thy
threshhold
fulfil
now
the
desire
of
my
heart
when
the
king
had
celebrated
the
praises
of
the
goddess
to
this
extent
a
voice
issued
from
the
temple
of
devi
saying
king
i
am
well
pleased
with
thee
ask
any
boon
that
thou
may
st
the
king
said
mother
if
thou
art
pleased
with
me
grant
me
a
devi
replied
king
thou
shalt
have
a
son
who
shall
be
very
powerful
and
very
then
the
king
made
offerings
of
sandal
unbroken
rice
flowers
incense
lamps
and
consecrated
food
and
paid
adoration
moreover
he
made
it
a
practice
of
worshipping
thus
daily
to
be
brief
after
some
days
a
son
was
born
to
the
king
the
king
with
his
family
and
kindred
proceeded
with
music
and
song
and
worshipped
at
the
shrine
of
in
the
meantime
it
happened
one
day
that
a
washerman
accompanied
by
a
friend
of
his
was
coming
from
a
certain
town
towards
this
city
and
the
temple
of
devi
met
his
eye
he
resolved
on
prostrating
himself
before
the
shrine
at
that
moment
he
beheld
a
washerman
s
daughter
who
was
very
handsome
coming
towards
him
he
was
fascinated
at
the
sight
of
her
and
went
to
worship
devi
after
prostrating
himself
he
joined
his
hands
in
supplication
and
said
in
his
heart
o
devi
if
through
thy
favour
my
marriage
to
this
beautiful
being
should
take
place
i
will
devote
my
head
as
an
offering
to
after
making
this
vow
and
prostrating
himself
he
took
his
friend
with
him
and
went
to
his
own
when
he
arrived
there
the
separation
from
his
love
so
troubled
him
that
sleep
hunger
thirst
all
were
forgotten
he
spent
the
whole
day
in
thoughts
of
her
on
perceiving
this
woful
state
of
his
his
friend
went
and
told
his
father
all
the
circumstances
his
father
also
became
alarmed
on
hearing
these
things
and
reflecting
on
the
matter
began
to
say
from
observing
his
state
it
seems
to
me
that
if
his
betrothal
to
that
maiden
does
not
take
place
he
will
grieve
to
death
wherefore
it
is
better
to
marry
him
to
the
girl
that
thus
he
may
be
having
thus
considered
he
took
his
son
s
friend
with
him
and
on
reaching
that
town
went
to
the
girl
s
father
and
said
i
have
come
to
solicit
something
of
you
if
you
will
grant
my
request
i
will
make
it
he
replied
if
i
possess
the
thing
i
will
give
it
speak
having
secured
his
promise
thus
he
said
give
your
daughter
in
marriage
to
my
on
hearing
this
he
too
agreed
to
the
proposal
and
having
had
a
priest
called
in
and
the
day
the
auspicious
conjunction
and
the
moment
determined
said
bring
your
son
i
for
my
part
will
stain
my
daughter
s
hands
on
hearing
this
he
arose
returned
to
his
own
house
got
ready
all
the
requisites
for
the
marriage
and
set
out
for
the
ceremony
and
on
reaching
the
place
and
having
the
marriage
ceremony
performed
he
took
his
son
and
with
him
and
returned
home
and
the
bride
and
bridegroom
commenced
a
happy
life
lit
make
the
girl
s
hands
among
the
hindus
for
some
days
before
marriage
the
hands
of
a
betrothed
couple
are
stained
yellow
with
turmeric
again
after
some
time
an
occasion
of
rejoicing
arose
at
the
girl
s
father
s
and
so
an
invitation
came
to
these
the
bride
and
bridegroom
also
the
wife
and
husband
got
ready
and
taking
their
friend
with
them
set
out
for
that
city
when
they
arrived
near
the
place
the
temple
of
devi
came
in
sight
and
then
his
vow
came
to
his
mind
thereupon
he
reflected
and
said
to
himself
i
am
a
great
liar
and
a
very
irreligious
wretch
for
i
have
lied
to
devi
herself
having
said
this
to
himself
he
spoke
to
his
friend
saying
do
you
tarry
here
while
i
pay
a
visit
to
and
to
his
wife
he
said
do
thou
also
stay
having
said
this
and
gone
to
the
temple
he
bathed
in
the
pool
went
before
devi
joined
his
hands
in
supplication
addressed
her
reverentially
and
raised
a
sword
and
struck
himself
on
the
neck
his
head
was
severed
from
his
body
and
fell
upon
the
to
be
brief
after
some
delay
his
friend
thought
that
as
he
had
been
gone
a
very
long
while
and
had
not
yet
returned
he
ought
to
go
and
see
what
had
happened
so
he
said
to
the
wife
stay
here
i
will
soon
hunt
him
up
and
bring
him
having
said
this
he
went
into
the
temple
of
devi
and
lo
his
friend
s
head
was
lying
apart
from
his
body
on
beholding
this
state
of
things
there
he
began
to
say
to
himself
the
world
is
a
hard
place
no
one
will
suppose
that
he
with
his
own
hand
offered
his
head
as
a
sacrifice
to
devi
on
the
contrary
they
will
say
that
as
his
wife
was
very
beautiful
he
the
friend
in
order
to
possess
her
killed
him
and
is
practising
this
artful
trick
therefore
it
is
preferable
to
die
here
whereas
to
obtain
an
evil
reputation
in
the
world
is
not
having
said
this
he
bathed
in
the
pool
came
into
the
presence
of
devi
joined
his
hands
and
made
obeisance
and
taking
up
the
sword
struck
himself
on
the
neck
so
that
his
head
was
severed
from
his
body
and
she
weary
of
standing
there
alone
and
watching
for
their
return
till
she
quite
despaired
went
in
quest
of
them
into
the
temple
of
devi
arrived
there
what
does
she
behold
but
the
two
lying
dead
then
seeing
them
both
dead
she
thought
to
herself
people
will
not
believe
that
these
two
have
voluntarily
offered
themselves
as
sacrifices
to
devi
everybody
will
say
that
the
widow
was
a
wanton
wretch
and
that
she
killed
them
both
and
left
them
that
she
might
indulge
in
her
depravity
it
is
better
to
die
than
to
endure
such
alter
reflecting
thus
she
plunged
into
the
pool
and
bathed
and
coming
into
the
presence
of
devi
bowed
her
head
in
obeisance
then
taking
up
the
sword
was
about
to
strike
herself
on
the
neck
when
devi
descended
from
the
throne
and
came
and
seized
her
hand
and
said
daughter
ask
a
boon
i
am
with
on
this
she
said
mother
if
thou
art
pleased
with
me
restore
these
two
to
then
devi
said
unite
their
heads
to
their
in
the
tumult
of
her
joy
she
changed
the
heads
in
putting
them
on
and
devi
brought
the
water
of
life
and
sprinkled
it
upon
them
the
two
rose
up
alive
and
began
disputing
one
with
another
one
saying
she
is
my
wife
the
other
she
is
having
related
so
much
of
the
story
the
sprite
said
now
king
vikramãjit
of
which
of
these
two
is
she
the
wife
the
king
said
hearken
the
guiding
principle
for
this
is
laid
down
in
the
book
of
law
thus
the
ganges
is
the
best
of
rivers
and
sumeru
is
the
most
excellent
of
mountains
and
kalpavriksh
is
the
most
excellent
of
trees
and
the
head
is
supreme
among
all
the
members
of
the
body
according
to
this
judgment
she
becomes
the
wife
of
him
who
possesses
the
superior
on
hearing
these
words
the
sprite
went
and
again
suspended
himself
on
that
tree
and
the
king
having
gone
and
bound
him
placed
him
on
his
shoulder
and
carried
him
off
kalpavriksh
is
a
fabulous
tree
yielding
all
wishes
said
to
exist
in
the

vii
the
sprite
said
o

there
is
a
city
named

which
is
champakeshwar
and
the
queen

is

when
she
became
marriageable
the
king
and
queen
began
to
feel
anxious
in
their
minds
and
the
news
spread
among
the
monarchs
of
the
different
countries
round
about
that
so
beautiful
a
girl
had
been
born
in
the
palace
of
king
champakeshwar
that
at
a
mere
glance
at
her
beauty
gods
men
and
holy
sages
remain
fascinated
thereupon
the
kings
of
the
different
countries
had
each
his
likeness
painted
and
sent
it
by
the
hands
of
a
brahman
to
king
champakeshwar
the
king
received
and
showed
the
portraits
of
all
the
monarchs
to
his
daughter
but
none
of
them
suited
her
fancy
thereupon
the
king
said
do
thou
then
make
a
public
choice
of
a
to
this
too
she
did
not
agree
but
said
to
her
father
father
give
me
to
him
who
possesses
the
three
qualities
of
beauty
strength
and
superior
in
fine
when
several
days
had
elapsed
four
suitors
came
from
four
different
countries
then
the
king
said
to
them
do
each
of
you
set
forth
clearly
before
me
the
superior
qualities
and
knowledge
he
one
of
them
said
i
possess
such
knowledge
that
i
manufacture
a
cloth
and
sell
it
for
five
rubies
when
i
realise
the
price
i
give
one
of
the
rubies
to
brahmans
of
another
i
make
an
offering
to
the
gods
a
third
i
wear
on
my
own
person
a
fourth
i
reserve
for
my
wife
the
fifth
i
sell
and
constantly
support
myself
with
the
money
so
obtained
no
one
else
possesses
this
knowledge
and
as
to
the
good
looks
i
possess
they
are
open
to
the
second
said
i
am
acquainted
with
the
languages
of
both
land
and
aquatic
beasts
and
birds
have
no
equal
in
strength
and
my
beauty
is
before
the
third
said
so
well
do
i
comprehend
the
learned
writings
that
no
equal
of
mine
exists
and
my
beauty
is
before
your
the
fourth
said
i
stand
alone
in
my
knowledge
of
the
use
of
weapons
there
is
no
one
like
me
i
can
shoot
an
arrow
which
will
strike
an
object
which
is
heard
but
not
seen
and
my
beauty
is
famous
in
the
world
you
too
must
surely
see
i
suspect
an
error
in
the
text
here
shãstra
for
shastra
for
the
third
suitor
had
already
claimed
the
possession
of
unrivalled
excellence
in
the
shãstras
while
the
fourth
boasts
of
his
superior
shill
in
archery
which
would
certainly
seem
to
accord
better
with
shastra
than
shãstra
moreover
the
judgment
of
king
vikram
shows
satisfactorily
i
think
that
shastra
is
the
word
intended
on
hearing
the
statements
of
the
four
of
them
the
king
began
to
think
to
himself
all
four
are
on
a
par
as
to
excellences
to
which
should
i
give
the
girl
having
reflected
thus
he
went
to
his
daughter
and
set
forth
the
virtues
of
the
whole
four
of
them
and
said
to
which
of
them
shall
i
give
thee
in
marriage
on
hearing
this
she
hung
down
her
head
through
modesty
and
kept
silent
making
no
after
relating
so
much
of
the
story
the
sprite
said
now
king
vikram
for
which
of
them
is
this
woman
suited
the
king
replied
he
who
makes
cloth
and
sells
it
is
a
by
caste
and
he
who
knows
the
languages
is
a
by
caste
he
who
has
studied
the
learned
writings
is
a
and
he
who
hits
with
an
arrow
an
object
which
is
simply
heard
and
not
seen
is
of
caste
the
woman
is
suitable
for
on
hearing
these
words
the
sprite
went
again
and
hung
himself
on
that
tree
and
the
king
too
went
thither
bound
him
placed
him
on
his
shoulder
and
carried
him
off
tale
viii
then
the
sprite
said
o
king
there
is
a
city
named
mithalãvatï
the
king
of
which
is
gunãdhip
a
young
rãjpüt
named
chiramdeva
came
from
a
distant
land
to
enter
his
service
he
used
to
go
daily
to
pay
his
respects
to
the
king
but
did
not
obtain
an
interview
and
in
the
course
of
a
year
he
consumed
all
the
money
he
had
brought
with
him
while
tarrying
here
without
employment
and
there
in
his
native
land
his
home
went
to
it
happened
one
day
that
the
king
mounted
his
horse
for
the
chase
and
chiramdeva
also
joined
his
cavalcade
the
king
became
accidentally
separated
from
his
followers
in
a
forest
and
the
attendants
lost
themselves
in
another
jungle
one
however
chiramdeva
was
following
the
king
at
length
he
called
out
and
said
your
majesty
all
the
attendants
have
remained
behind
while
i
am
accompanying
you
making
my
horse
keep
pace
with
on
hearing
this
the
king
reined
in
his
horse
and
so
he
came
up
to
the
king
the
king
looked
at
him
and
asked
how
hast
thou
become
so
emaciated
then
he
replied
if
i
live
with
a
master
such
that
he
cherishes
thousands
of
people
while
he
takes
no
thought
of
me
no
blame
attaches
to
him
for
this
but
rather
my
own
fate
is
to
blame
as
for
example
by
daylight
the
whole
world
is
clearly
visible
yet
it
is
not
visible
to
the
owl
what
blame
can
be
imputed
to
the
sun
for
this
it
is
astonishing
to
me
that
he
who
caused
the
means
of
subsistence
to
reach
me
in
my
mother
s
womb
should
take
no
thought
of
me
now
when
i
have
been
born
and
am
capable
of
enjoying
worldly
aliment
i
know
not
whether
he
sleeps
or
is
dead
and
in
my
opinion
it
is
better
to
swallow
deadly
poison
and
die
than
to
ask
for
goods
and
money
from
a
great
man
who
while
giving
the
same
makes
a
wry
face
and
turns
up
his
nose
in
contempt
and
raises
his
brows
now
these
six
things
render
a
man
contemptible
first
the
friendship
of
a
perfidious
man
second
causeless
laughter
third
altercation
with
a
woman
fourth
the
serving
a
bad
master
fifth
riding
a
donkey
sixth
unpolished
or
uncouth
speech
and
the
following
five
things
the
creator
records
in
a
man
s
destiny
at
the
time
of
his
birth
first
length
of
life
second
acts
third
wealth
fourth
fifth
reputation
o
king
so
long
as
a
man
s
virtues
are
conspicuous
all
continue
to
be
his
servants
but
when
his
virtues
decrease
his
very
friends
become
his
a
dialect
without
sanskrit
i
should
much
prefer
translating
so
long
as
a
man
s
fortunes
are
in
the
ascendant
were
it
not
that
none
of
the
lexicons
i
have
seen
sanctions
the
sense
of
fortunes
for
punya
this
one
thing
however
is
certain
by
serving
a
good
master
one
derives
benefit
sooner
or
later
he
does
not
remain
on
hearing
this
the
king
pondered
over
all
these
words
but
did
not
then
make
any
reply
he
said
this
to
him
however
i
feel
hungry
bring
me
something
to
eat
from
chiramdeva
said
your
majesty
bread
is
not
to
be
obtained
having
said
this
he
went
into
the
jungle
killed
a
deer
took
out
a
flint
and
steel
from
his
pocket
kindled
a
fire
broiled
some
slices
of
meat
and
served
up
a
plentiful
meal
to
the
king
and
partook
of
it
himself
as
well
to
be
brief
when
the
king
was
quite
satisfied
he
said
now
rãjpüt
i
conduct
me
to
the
city
for
the
road
is
not
known
to
he
conducted
the
king
into
the
city
and
brought
him
to
his
palace
then
the
king
appointed
him
to
an
office
and
bestowed
many
robes
and
jewels
upon
him
after
that
he
continued
in
close
attendance
upon
the
which
might
mean
boiled
rice
or
cakes
of
bread
and
boiled
pulse
when
the
king
s
belly
was
filled
in
short
the
king
one
day
sent
that
rãjpüt
on
some
business
to
the
seaside
when
he
reached
the
he
beheld
a
temple
dedicated
to
devi
he
entered
it
and
worshipped
devi
but
on
the
instant
of
his
coming
out
thence
a
beautiful
damsel
came
up
to
him
from
behind
and
began
questioning
him
saying
o
man
why
hast
thou
come
here
he
replied
i
have
come
in
quest
of
pleasure
and
at
the
sight
of
thy
beauty
i
am
she
said
if
thou
hast
any
design
on
me
first
go
and
bathe
in
this
pool
after
that
i
will
listen
to
whatever
thou
shalt
say
to
on
the
instant
of
hearing
this
he
took
off
his
clothes
entered
the
pool
and
dipped
and
came
out
and
lo
he
was
standing
in
his
own
city
on
beholding
this
marvel
he
was
filled
with
fear
and
returning
home
in
his
helplessness
clothed
himself
and
went
and
related
the
whole
story
to
the
king
the
king
no
sooner
heard
it
than
he
said
show
me
this
wonder
this
said
he
ordered
the
horses
and
both
mounted
and
set
off
after
several
days
they
reached
the
and
entered
the
same
temple
of
devi
and
paid
adoration
farther
when
the
king
came
out
the
very
same
damsel
accompanied
by
a
female
friend
came
and
stood
beside
the
king
and
on
beholding
the
king
s
handsome
appearance
became
fascinated
and
said
o
king
i
will
execute
any
command
you
may
give
the
king
replied
saying
if
thou
wilt
obey
my
command
become
the
wife
of
my
she
said
i
have
become
the
slave
of
thy
beauty
how
then
can
i
become
his
wife
the
king
replied
it
was
but
this
instant
thou
saidst
to
me
i
will
obey
any
command
you
may
give
now
whatever
the
good
promise
they
perform
keep
thy
plighted
word
and
become
the
wife
of
my
on
hearing
this
she
said
your
word
is
law
to
thereupon
the
king
married
his
servant
to
her
without
the
usual
ceremonies
and
brought
them
both
with
him
to
his
a
gandharb
marriage
is
one
where
the
usual
formalities
are
dispensed
with
and
the
parties
become
man
and
wife
by
mutual
consent
having
related
so
much
of
the
story
the
sprite
said
tell
me
o
king
of
master
and
servant
whose
was
the
greater
virtue
the
king
said
the
servant
the
sprite
said
again
was
not
the
merit
of
the
king
greater
who
obtained
so
beautiful
a
woman
and
bestowed
her
on
his
servant
thereupon
king
bir
vikramãjït
said
what
superior
merit
is
there
in
their
conferring
favours
whose
office
it
is
to
do
so
but
he
who
while
having
his
own
interests
to
attend
to
promotes
the
interests
of
another
is
the
greater
for
this
reason
the
servant
s
merit
was
the
on
hearing
these
words
the
sprite
went
and
hung
himself
on
that
same
tree
and
the
king
went
and
again
took
him
down
from
thence
placed
him
on
his
shoulder
and
carried
him
away
tale
ix
the
sprite
said
o
king
a
city
named
madanpur
where
was
a
king
named
birbar
now
in
that
same
country
there
was
a
merchant
named
hiranyadatt
whose
daughter
s
name
was
madansenã
one
day
in
the
she
went
with
her
female
friends
into
her
garden
to
stroll
about
and
enjoy
the
scene
it
so
happened
that
previous
to
her
coming
out
somdatt
the
son
of
a
merchant
named
dharmdatt
had
come
with
a
friend
to
take
a
stroll
in
the
forest
on
his
return
thence
he
came
into
that
garden
and
on
beholding
her
became
enamoured
and
began
to
say
to
his
friend
brother
should
she
ever
be
united
to
me
then
my
living
will
be
to
some
purpose
and
if
not
then
my
living
in
the
world
is
in
addressing
these
words
to
his
friend
and
being
distracted
by
the
pangs
of
separation
he
involuntarily
approached
her
and
seizing
her
hand
began
to
say
if
thou
wilt
not
love
me
i
will
sacrifice
my
life
on
thy
she
replied
act
not
thus
that
would
be
a
then
he
said
thy
amorous
glances
have
pierced
my
heart
and
the
fire
of
separation
from
thee
has
consumed
my
body
my
whole
consciousness
and
understanding
have
been
destroyed
by
this
pain
and
at
this
moment
through
the
overpowering
influence
of
love
i
have
no
regard
for
right
or
wrong
but
if
thou
wilt
give
me
thy
word
new
life
will
enter
my
she
said
on
the
fifth
day
from
this
day
my
marriage
will
take
place
but
i
will
first
have
intercourse
with
thee
and
afterwards
abide
at
my
husband
after
giving
him
this
promise
and
taking
her
oath
to
keep
it
she
departed
to
her
home
and
he
to
to
be
brief
on
the
fifth
day
her
marriage
took
place
her
husband
brought
her
to
his
home
after
the
marriage
after
some
days
the
wives
of
her
husband
s
younger
and
elder
brothers
compelled
her
to
go
to
her
husband
at
night
she
entered
the
nuptial
chamber
and
sat
quietly
down
in
a
corner
in
the
meantime
her
husband
seeing
her
took
her
hand
and
made
her
sit
on
the
bed
in
fine
as
he
was
about
to
embrace
her
she
shook
him
off
with
her
hand
and
related
to
him
all
that
she
had
promised
the
merchant
s
son
on
hearing
this
her
husband
said
if
thou
really
desirest
to
go
to
him
having
received
her
husband
s
permission
she
started
for
the
merchant
s
place
a
thief
seeing
her
on
the
road
came
up
to
her
in
delight
and
said
whither
goest
thou
alone
at
this
midnight
hour
in
this
bedecked
with
such
garments
and
jewels
she
replied
to
the
place
where
my
dearly
beloved
on
hearing
this
the
thief
said
who
is
thy
protector
here
she
began
to
say
cupid
my
protector
with
his
bow
and
arrows
is
with
having
said
this
she
then
related
her
whole
story
to
the
thief
from
beginning
to
end
and
said
do
not
spoil
my
attire
i
give
thee
my
word
that
when
i
return
thence
i
will
deliver
my
jewels
to
on
hearing
this
the
thief
said
to
himself
she
leaves
me
in
truth
with
a
promise
to
deliver
up
her
jewels
to
me
then
why
should
i
spoil
her
attire
thus
reflecting
he
let
her
go
he
himself
sat
down
there
while
she
went
to
the
place
where
somdatt
was
lying
asleep
she
having
suddenly
roused
him
as
soon
as
she
got
there
he
arose
bewildered
and
commenced
saying
art
thou
the
daughter
of
a
god
or
sage
or
serpent
tell
me
truly
who
art
thou
and
whence
art
thou
come
to
me
she
replied
i
am
the
daughter
of
a
man
the
daughter
of
the
merchant
hiranyadatt
madansenã
is
my
name
and
dost
thou
not
remember
that
thou
didst
forcibly
seize
my
hand
in
the
grove
and
didst
insist
on
my
giving
thee
my
oath
and
i
swore
at
thy
bidding
that
i
would
leave
the
man
i
was
married
to
and
come
to
thee
i
have
come
accordingly
do
unto
me
whatever
thou
nig
is
the
name
of
the
fabulous
serpents
said
to
have
a
human
face
inhabiting
pãtala
or
the
infernal
regions
on
this
he
asked
hast
thou
told
this
story
to
thy
husband
or
not
she
replied
saying
i
have
mentioned
the
whole
affair
and
after
becoming
acquainted
with
everything
he
has
allowed
me
to
come
to
somdatt
said
this
matter
is
like
jewels
without
apparel
or
food
without
clarified
butter
or
singing
out
of
tune
all
these
things
are
alike
similarly
dirty
garments
mar
beauty
bad
food
saps
the
strength
a
wicked
wife
deprives
of
life
a
bad
son
ruins
the
family
whereas
a
demon
takes
life
on
his
being
enraged
a
woman
either
as
a
friend
or
a
foe
is
in
both
cases
the
occasion
of
sorrow
what
a
woman
does
not
do
is
of
little
moment
for
she
does
not
give
utterance
to
the
thoughts
of
her
mind
and
what
is
at
the
tip
of
her
tongue
she
does
not
reveal
and
what
she
does
she
does
not
tell
of
a
wonderful
creature
has
god
created
in
the
world
in
after
uttering
these
words
the
merchant
s
son
answered
her
saying
i
will
have
nothing
to
do
with
another
s
on
hearing
this
she
took
her
way
back
home
again
on
the
way
she
met
the
thief
and
told
him
the
whole
story
the
thief
on
hearing
it
applauded
her
highly
and
let
her
go
she
came
nigh
her
husband
and
told
him
all
the
circumstances
but
her
husband
evinced
no
affection
for
her
and
said
the
beauty
of
the
cuckoo
consists
in
its
note
alone
a
woman
s
beauty
consists
in
her
fidelity
to
her
husband
and
the
beauty
of
an
ugly
man
is
his
knowledge
the
beauty
of
a
devotee
is
his
patient
having
related
so
much
of
the
story
the
sprite
said
o
king
whose
is
the
highest
merit
of
these
three
king
vikramãjït
replied
the
thief
s
merit
is
the
the
sprite
said
how
the
king
replied
seeing
her
heart
set
on
another
man
her
husband
gave
her
up
through
dread
of
the
king
somdatt
let
her
alone
whereas
there
was
no
reason
for
the
thief
s
leaving
her
unmolested
hence
the
thief
is
the
on
hearing
this
the
sprite
went
again
and
suspended
himself
on
that
tree
and
the
king
also
went
there
took
him
down
from
the
tree
bound
and
placed
him
on
his
shoulder
and
once
more
carried
him
away
tale
x
the
sprite
said
o
king
in
the
country
of
gaur
there
is
a
city
called
baradmãn
and
the
king
of
that
place
was
named
gunshekhar
his
minister
was
a
follower
of
the
jain
persuasion
abhaichand
by
name
through
his
persuasion
the
king
too
entered
the
pale
of
the
jain
religion
he
prohibited
the
worship
of
shiva
as
also
that
of
vishnu
and
offerings
of
cattle
grants
of
land
oblations
to
deceased
ancestors
gambling
and
intoxicating
liquors
all
these
he
interdicted
no
one
was
allowed
to
practise
them
in
the
city
and
no
one
could
carry
away
bones
to
the
ganges
and
the
minister
too
with
the
king
s
sanction
for
these
matters
had
it
proclaimed
in
the
city
that
whoever
performs
these
acts
the
king
will
confiscate
all
his
property
and
inflict
punishment
on
him
and
expel
him
from
the
these
oblations
consist
of
balls
pind
of
meat
or
rice
mixed
up
with
milk
curds
flowers
and
offered
to
the
manes
at
the
several
shraddhas
or
funeral
ceremonies
and
worship
of
the
manes
by
the
nearest
surviving
relations
thereafter
the
minister
said
one
day
to
the
king
attend
o
king
to
an
exposition
of
the
sacred
law
whosoever
takes
the
life
of
any
one
this
same
takes
his
life
also
in
another
state
of
existence
it
is
on
account
of
this
sin
that
living
and
dying
are
inseparable
from
man
on
his
entering
this
world
he
is
born
again
and
again
and
again
he
dies
hence
it
behoves
man
on
his
being
born
into
the
world
to
treasure
up
virtuous
deeds
observe
how
brahmã
yishnü
mahãdeva
in
one
form
or
another
become
incarnate
in
the
world
under
the
influence
of
love
anger
covetousness
or
infatuation
a
cow
forsooth
is
superior
to
them
for
she
is
free
from
passion
hatred
pride
anger
covetousness
infatuation
moreover
she
sustains
the
subjects
and
the
sons
which
are
born
to
her
also
impart
the
utmost
ease
to
the
living
things
of
the
earth
and
cherish
them
it
is
for
this
reason
that
all
the
deities
and
holy
sages
hold
the
cow
sacred
therefore
to
worship
the
gods
is
not
well
worship
the
cow
in
this
world
and
it
is
a
duty
to
protect
the
life
of
every
animal
from
the
elephant
to
the
ant
including
beasts
birds
up
to
man
there
is
no
duty
equal
to
that
in
the
world
those
who
add
to
their
flesh
by
eating
the
flesh
of
other
creatures
ultimately
suffer
the
torments
of
hell
hence
it
is
incumbent
on
man
to
preserve
life
those
who
regard
not
the
sufferings
of
others
but
go
on
destroying
the
life
of
other
creatures
and
eating
them
their
lives
are
shortened
on
the
earth
and
they
are
born
cripples
or
lame
or
blind
of
one
eye
or
blind
of
both
eyes
or
dwarfs
or
or
with
some
such
bodily
defect
according
to
the
limbs
of
beasts
and
birds
which
they
devour
they
eventually
lose
similar
members
of
their
own
further
the
drinking
of
intoxicating
liquors
is
a
great
sin
hence
the
consumption
of
flesh
and
intoxicating
drinks
is
not
thus
unfolding
to
the
king
the
wisdom
stored
up
in
his
mind
the
minister
made
him
so
sound
a
convert
to
the
jain
faith
that
whatever
he
advised
the
king
did
and
he
paid
no
respect
to
any
brahman
ascetic
itinerant
devotee
or
religious
mendicant
and
governed
his
kingdom
according
to
this
religion
one
day
coming
under
the
power
of
death
he
died
thereupon
his
son
by
name
ascended
the
throne
and
began
to
reign
one
day
having
had
the
minister
abhaichand
seized
and
seven
plaits
made
of
the
hair
on
his
head
and
his
face
blackened
and
the
minister
himself
seated
on
a
donkey
and
a
drum
beaten
and
hands
clapped
in
derision
after
him
he
then
banished
him
from
the
kingdom
and
carried
on
his
government
free
from
all
the
sewra
sanyasi
and
darwesh
are
all
religious
mendicants
the
first
is
of
the
jain
religion
the
second
a
brahman
and
the
third
a
muhammadan
one
day
in
the
the
king
accompanied
by
his
queens
went
to
take
a
stroll
in
a
garden
there
was
a
large
tank
in
that
garden
and
the
lotus
was
in
full
bloom
therein
on
beholding
the
beauty
of
the
tank
the
king
stripped
off
his
clothes
and
went
down
to
bathe
having
plucked
a
flower
and
come
to
the
side
he
was
handing
it
to
one
of
the
queens
when
it
slipped
from
his
hand
and
fell
on
the
queen
s
foot
and
by
the
blow
it
inflicted
the
queen
s
foot
was
broken
on
this
the
king
became
alarmed
and
forthwith
coming
out
from
the
tank
began
applying
remedies
and
in
the
meantime
night
came
on
and
the
moon
shone
forth
no
sooner
did
the
moon
s
beams
fall
than
blisters
arose
on
the
body
of
the
second
queen
farther
just
then
the
sound
of
a
wooden
pestle
from
some
householder
s
suddenly
reached
the
third
queen
and
she
was
instantly
attacked
with
so
severe
a
headache
that
she
fainted
after
narrating
so
much
the
sprite
said
o
king
which
of
these
three
was
the
most
delicate
the
king
replied
the
one
who
got
the
pain
in
the
head
and
fainted
away
she
was
the
most
on
hearing
these
words
the
sprite
again
went
and
suspended
himself
on
that
tree
and
the
king
went
there
and
took
him
down
and
making
a
bundle
of
him
placed
him
on
his
shoulder
and
walked
off
with
him
tale
xi
the
sprite
said
your
majesty
there
is
a
city
named
punyapur
the
king
of
which
was
named
ballabh
and
his
minister
s
name
was
satyaprakash
and
the
name
of
the
minister
s
wife
was
lakshmi
one
day
the
king
said
to
his
minister
if
one
who
is
a
king
does
not
enjoy
himself
with
beautiful
women
his
holding
sovereignty
is
in
having
said
this
and
made
over
the
burthen
of
government
to
the
minister
he
himself
gladly
entered
upon
a
course
of
amorous
pleasures
he
abandoned
all
cares
of
the
state
and
commenced
spending
his
days
and
nights
in
it
so
happened
that
one
day
the
minister
was
sitting
dejected
at
home
when
his
wife
asked
him
husband
you
seem
to
me
to
be
very
weak
he
replied
saying
night
and
day
the
cares
of
government
weigh
heavily
on
me
and
hence
my
body
has
become
feeble
while
the
king
is
the
whole
day
long
occupied
with
his
own
pleasures
and
the
minister
s
wife
said
o
husband
you
have
carried
on
the
government
for
a
long
time
now
take
leave
of
the
king
and
undertake
a
pilgrimage
for
few
he
remained
silent
on
hearing
this
speech
of
hers
afterwards
when
he
stirred
out
when
he
rose
thence
he
went
to
the
king
at
the
time
of
his
holding
a
court
and
obtaining
his
permission
to
go
set
out
on
a
pilgrimage
journeying
on
he
reached
setband
rãmeshwar
on
the
as
soon
as
he
arrived
there
he
visited
the
shrine
of
mahãdeva
and
came
out
of
the
temple
when
his
gaze
happening

sword
and
struck
such
a
blow
that
the
head
of
the
demon
was
severed
from
the
body
and
lay
quivering
on
the
ground
on
beholding
this
she
said
o
gallant
man
thou
hast
done
me
a
great
kindness
after
saying
this
she
spoke
again
saying
it
is
not
every
mountain
that

rubies
nor
every
city
that
holds
true
men
nor
does
the
grow
in
every
forest
nor
do
pearls
exist
in
the
head
of

thereupon
the
king
enquired
why
did
this
demon
come
to
thee
on
the
fourteenth
night
of
the
waning
moon
she
said
my
father

name

custom
for
my
father
not
to
partake
of
food
without

one
day
i
was
not
at

at
thereupon

became
angry
and
pronounced
a
curse
on
me
saying
a
demon
will
come
and
embrace
thee
every
fourteenth
night
of
the
waning
on
hearing
this
i
said
father
you
have
indeed
given
me
your
curse
but
now
have
mercy
on
me
he
replied
when
an
intrepid
man
shall
come
and
slay
that
demon
thou
wilt
escape
from
this
now
therefore
i
have
escaped
from
that
curse
and
i
will
now
go
and
pay
my
respects
to
my
the
king
said
if
thou
appreciatest
the
kindness
i
have
done
thee
come
at
once
and
visit
my
dominions
after
that
go
and
visit
thy
she
said
very
well
i
consent
to
what
you
thereupon
the
king
brought
heir
with
him
to
his
capital
festive
music
and
rejoicing
began
to
take
place
the
news
spread
throughout
the
city
that
the
king
had
arrived

songs
of
congratulation
and
commenced
in
every
house
and
after
that
all
the
musicians
and
singers
of
the
city
came
and
offered
their
congratulations
at
the
court
the
king
gave
away
many
presents
and
performed
many
pious
again
after
some
days
that
fair
one
said
now
your
majesty
i
will
go
to
my
father
the
king
said
in
sadness
very
well
when
she
perceived
the
king
to
be
sad
she
said
your
majesty
i
will
not
the
king
said
why
hast
thou
given
up
the
idea
of
going
to
thy
father
she
replied
i
have
now
become
one
of
the
human
race
and
my
father
is
a
were
i
to
go
now
he
would
show
me
no
respect

is
my
reason
for
not
on
hearing
this
the
king
was
highly
delighted
and
gave
away
lacs
of
rupees
in
presents
and
religious
offerings

told
so
much
of
the
tale
the
sprite
said
o
king
why
did
the
minister
die
then
king
bïr
vikramãjït
said
the
minister
perceived
that
the
king
had
taken
to
sensual
enjoyments
and
banished
all
the
cares
of
government
from
his
mind
that
the
subjects
had
lost
their
master
or
protector
and
so
no
one
would
heed
what
he
the
minister
said
this
is
the
anxiety
of
which
he
having
heard
this
the
sprite
went
again
and
hung
himself
on
that
tree
the
king
went
again
as
on
previous
occasions
and
placed
him
on
his
shoulder
and
carried
him
away
tale
xii
the
sprite
said
o
king
bir
vikramãjit
there
is
a
city
named
chürãpur
where
a
king
named
chürãman
ruled
whose
spiritual
teacher
s
name
was
devaswãmi
and
he
had
a
son
named
hariswãmï
he
was
as
beautiful
as
cupid
equalled
brihaspati
in
his
knowledge
of
scientific
and
religious
treatises
and
was
as
wealthy
as
kuvera
he
wedded
and
brought
home
a
brahman
s
daughter
whose
name
was
brihaspati
is
the
regent
of
the
planet
jupiter
and
the
preceptor
of
the
gods
kuvera
is
the
god
of
wealth
to
be
brief
one
night
in
the
hot
season
they
were
both
sleeping
soundly
on
the
flat
roof
of
a
summer
house
the
woman
s
veil
accidentally
slipped
off
her
face
while
a
seated
on
a
car
was
proceeding
somewhere
through
the
air
his
gaze
suddenly
falling
upon
her
he
lowered
the
car
and
placing
her
asleep
on
the
car
flew
off
with
her
after
some
time
the
brahman
also
awoke
and
lo
his
wife
was
not
beside
him
on
this
he
became
alarmed
and
coming
down
from
thence
searched
throughout
the
house
when
he
did
not
find
her
there
either
he
went
about
seeking
her
through
all
the
streets
and
lanes
of
the
city
but
did
not
find
her
thereupon
he
began
to
say
to
himself
who
has
carried
her
off
and
whither
has
she
gone
in
short
when
his
efforts
were
of
no
avail
he
returned
home
helpless
and
regretful
and
searched
for
her
there
a
second
time
but
did
not
find
her
when
the
house
appeared
desolate
to
him
without
her
he
lost
all
in
his
disquietude
and
misery
and
began
crying
out
oh
darling
of
my
soul
oh
darling
of
my
soul
further
being
exceedingly
agitated
by
her
separation
from
him
he
gave
up
the
position
of
a
householder
renounced
the
world
girt
a
simple
round
his
loins
rubbed
the
ashes
of
burnt
on
his
body
put
on
a
necklace
of
beads
quitted
the
town
and
set
out
on
a
pilgrimage
proceeding
on
his
pilgrimage
from
town
to
town
and
village
to
village
he
reached
a
certain
town
at
when
extreme
hunger
left
him
no
alternative
he
made
a
vessel
of
the
leaves
of
a
and
carrying
it
to
the
house
of
a
brahman
said
to
him
give
me
some
food
in
the
fact
is
when
a
man
comes
under
the
influence
of
love
he
has
no
thought
of
duty
caste
or
food
and
regardless
of
everything
he
eats
food
wherever
he
can
obtain
it
when
he
begged
alms
of
the
brahman
he
the
brahman
took
the
vessel
from
him
and
entered
the
house
and
brought
it
back
to
him
filled
with
rice
boiled
in
milk
he
took
the
cup
and
came
to
the
margin
of
a
tank
there
was
a
large
there
he
placed
the
cup
at
the
root
of
that
and
went
to
wash
his
face
and
hands
in
the
a
black
snake
came
out
from
the
roots
of
the
tree
and
having
dipped
its
mouth
into
the
cup
went
away
and
so
the
whole
contents
of
the
cup
had
become
poisoned
when
in
the
meantime
he
also
returned
after
washing
his
hands
and
face
this
matter
however
was
unknown
to
him
while
hunger
on
the
other
hand
beset
him
sorely
thus
he
ate
the
rice
and
milk
as
soon
as
he
came
and
the
poison
instantly
entered
his
system
thereupon
he
went
to
the
brahman
and
said
thou
hast
given
me
poison
and
i
am
now
dying
of
having
said
so
much
he
reeled
and
fell
and
died
again
the
brahman
seeing
him
dead
turned
his
own
wife
out
of
the
house
and
said
go
thou
hence
thou
murderess
of
a
brahman
having
told
so
much
of
the
tale
the
sprite
said
o
king
to
which
of
these
does
the
guilt
of
killing
a
brahman
attach
the
king
said
poison
exists
in
a
snake
s
mouth
as
a
matter
of
course
therefore
no
guilt
attaches
to
it
again
the
brahman
gave
him
alms
considering
him
to
be
hungry
therefore
guilt
does
not
attach
to
him
further
the
brahman
s
wife
had
given
him
alms
at
the
bidding
of
her
husband
she
too
is
without
sin
and
he
ate
the
milk
and
rice
unwittingly
and
hence
he
also
is
guiltless
in
short
whoever
imputes
guilt
to
anyone
of
these
is
himself
a
on
hearing
this
the
sprite
went
again
and
hung
on
to
that
tree
and
the
king
also
went
there
and
taking
him
down
and
binding
him
placed
him
on
his
shoulder
and
carried
him
away
from
there

had
him
bathed
and
washed
and
clothed
in
fine
apparel
and
mounted
on
a
camel
he
sent
him
all
round
the
city
accompanied
by
a
crier
and
ordered
the
impaling
stake
to
be
erected
for
him
whoever
among
the
people
of
the
city
saw
him
said
this
same
thief

plundered
the
whole
city
and

king
will
now
impale
when
the

arrived
near
the
house
of
the
merchant
dharmdhwaj
the
merchant
s
daughter
hearing
the
sound
of
the
crier

her
handmaid
what
is
this
proclamation
about

replied
the
king
has
brought
captive
the
thief
who
used
to
commit
robberies
in
the
city
now
he
will
impale
on
hearing
this
she
also
came
running
to
the
lattice
to
see
no
sooner
did
she
behold
the
thief
s
comeliness
and
manly
form
than
she
became
fascinated
and
coming
to
her
father
said
do
you
go
to
the
king
this
moment
and
return
with
that
thief
the
merchant
said
how
can
it
be
expected
that
at
my
request
the
king
will
release
the
thief
who
has
robbed
his
whole
city
and
on
whose
account
his
whole
army
has
been
destroyed
she
again
urged
if
you
have
to
give
up
even
all
you
possess
for
the
king
to
release
him
do
you
bring
him
away
free
and
should
he
not
come
i
too
will
sacrifice
my
on
hearing
this
the
merchant
went
to
the
king
and
said
your
majesty
receive
five
lacs
of
rupees
from
me
and
set
the
thief
at
the
king
said
this
thief
robbed
the
whole
city
and
my
whole
army
was
swallowed
up
through
him
i
will
not
on
any
account
let
him
when
the
king
did
not
heed
his
request
he
returned
home
in
despair
and
said
to
his
daughter
i
said
all
that
it
was
right
to
say
but
the
king
did
not
in
the
meantime
having
had
the
thief
taken
round
the
city
they
brought
him
to
a
near
the
impaling
stake
now
the
thief
having
heard
of
the
predicament
of
the
merchant
s
daughter
first
laughed
aloud
and
then
wept
bitterly
the
people
the
while
pulled
him
down
on
the
stake
and
the
merchant
s
daughter
receiving
intimation
of
his
death
came
to
the
same
place
to
devote
herself
to
death
for
his
sake
she
had
a
funeral
pile
constructed
and
sitting
thereon
had
the
thief
taken
off
the
stake
placed
his
head
on
her
lap
apd
quietly
seated
herself
to
be
burnt
she
was
on
the
point
of
having
the
torch
put
to
it
the
pile
when
a
temple
sacred
to
devi
happening
to
be
on
the
spot
devi
instantly
came
out
of
her
temple
and
said
daughter
i
am
pleased
with
thy
courage

a
she
said
mother
if
thou
art
pleased
with
me
restore
this
thief
to
thereupon
the
goddess
said
even
so
shall
it
having
said
this
she
brought
nectar
from
the
and
restored
the
thief
to
having
told
so
much
of
the
story
the
sprite
inquired
say
o
king
why
the
thief
first
laughed
and
why
he
afterwards
wept
the
king
said
i
know
the
reason
why
he
laughed
and
i
know
also
why
he
wept
attend
o
sprite
the
thief
thought
within
himself
now
that
she
is
giving
up
all
that
she
possesses
to
the
king
for
my
sake
what
return
can
i
make
he
wept
at
the
thought
of
this
again
however
he
reflected
she
loved
me
when
i
was
about
to
die
the
ways
of
god
are
altogether
inscrutable
he
bestows
wealth
on
the
unlucky
knowledge
on
one
of
low
origin
a
beautiful
wife
on
a
fool
and
he
causes
rain
to
fall
in
showers
on
the
thinking
of
such
things
he
on
hearing
this
the
sprite
went
again
and
hung
on
to
that
tree
the
king
returned
there
and
unloosing
him
made
a
bundle
of
him
placed
him
on
his
shoulder
and
took
him
away
tale
xiv
the
sprite
said
attend
king
vikram
there
is
a
city
named
kusmavati
of
which
one
subichãr
was
king
whose
daughter
s
name
was
when
she
became
marriageable
she
went
out
one
spring
day
along
with
her
companions
to
stroll
about
in
the
garden
now
before
arrangements
had
been
made
for
the
ladies
to
come
out
before
the
garden
had
been
cleared
of
all
strangers
and
others
not
permitted
to
set
eyes
on
the
women
a
brahman
s
son
named
manswi
of
twenty
years
or
so
very
handsome
had
come
into
the
garden
in
the
course
of
his
wanderings
and
meeting
with
cool
shade
under
a
tree
had
fallen
asleep
there
the
king
s
attendants
came
and
made
arrangements
for
the
ladies
of
the
seraglio
in
the
garden
but
it
so
happened
that
none
of
them
saw
the
brahman
s
son
sleeping
there
and
so
he
continued
sleeping
under
that
tree
and
the
princess
entered
the
garden
with
her
attendants
strolling
about
with
her
companions
where
does
she
come
but
to
the
place
where
the
brahman
s
son
was
sleeping
she
no
sooner
arrived
there
than
he
also
awoke
at
the
sound
of
the
people
s
footsteps
the
eyes
of
both
met
and
to
such
a
degree
did
they
come
under
cupid
s
power
that
on
the
one
side
the
brahman
s
son
fell
upon
the
ground
in
a
swoon
on
the
other
she
too
was
so
beside
herself
that
her
legs
began
to
tremble
her
companions
however
quickly
laid
hold
of
her
on
the
very
instant
at
last
they
laid
her
down
in
a
litter
and
brought
her
home
and
the
brahman
s
son
was
lying
in
so
complete
a
state
of
insensibility
here
that
he
had
no
consciousness
whatever
of
his
body
or
during
this
interval
two
brahmans
named
shashi
and
müldeva
from
the
country
of
kanvrü
where
they
had
studied
the
occult
sciences
happened
to
pass
by
there
müldeva
seeing
the
brahman
s
son
lying
said
shashi
how
is
it
that
he
is
lying
in
such
utter
unconsciousness
he
replied
a
damsel
has
shot
forth
the
arrows
of
her
eyes
from
the
bow
of
her
eyebrows
hence
he
is
lying
müldeva
said
we
ought
to
rouse
he
replied
what
need
is
there
for
you
to
rouse
him
he
did
not
heed
shashi
s
words
but
sprinkled
water
over
him
and
restored
him
to
consciousness
and
asked
what
has
been
the
matter
with
thee
the
brahman
said
one
should
relate
his
troubles
to
him
who
can
remove
them
for
what
is
to
be
gained
by
relating
your
sorrows
to
him
who
on
hearing
of
them
is
unable
to
remove
them
he
said
well
tell
me
your
troubles
i
will
remove
on
hearing
this
he
said
it
was
but
now
that
the
princess
came
here
with
her
companions
and
it
was
through
seeing
her
that
i
have
fallen
into
this
state
should
i
obtain
possession
of
her
i
will
preserve
my
life
otherwise
i
will
abandon
then
he
replied
come
to
my
abode
i
will
exert
myself
to
the
utmost
to
obtain
her
and
if
i
should
not
succeed
i
will
bestow
great
wealth
upon
thereupon
manswi
said
god
has
created
many
a
jewel
in
the
world
but
the
jewel
woman
surpasses
all
and
for
her
sake
it
is
that
man
treasures
up
wealth
when
i
have
lost
the
woman
what
will
i
do
with
the
wealth
brute
beasts
are
better
off
in
the
world
than
those
who
do
not
possess
themselves
of
handsome
wives
the
fruit
of
merit
is
wealth
and
the
advantage
of
wealth
is
ease
and
the
consequence
of
ease
is
the
taking
a
wife
now
what
happiness
can
there
be
where
there
is
no
wife
on
hearing
this
müldeva
said
i
will
give
thee
whatsoever
thou
may
st
ask
then
he
said
o
brahman
obtain
that
same
maiden
s
hand
for
müldeva
thereupon
said
so
be
it
come
along
with
me
i
will
have
that
very
maiden
bestowed
on
in
short
ministering
much
comfort
to
him
he
took
him
to
his
house
and
when
he
reached
there
he
prepared
two
magic
pills
one
pill
he
gave
to
the
young
brahman
saying
when
thou
puttest
this
into
thy
mouth
thou
wilt
be
turned
into
a
girl
of
twelve
years
and
when
thou
takest
it
out
of
thy
mouth
thou
wilt
become
the
man
thou
wert
he
said
further
put
this
into
thy
on
his
putting
it
into
his
mouth
he
became
a
girl
of
twelve
years
and
he
müldeva
having
put
the
other
pill
into
his
own
mouth
became
transformed
into
an
old
man
of
eighty
years
and
taking
that
young
girl
with
him
he
proceeded
to
the
the
king
seeing
the
brahman
saluted
him
gave
him
a
seat
and
another
to
the
young
girl
also
then
the
brahman
gave
him
his
blessing
in
verse
saying
may
he
whose
glory
pervades
the
three
worlds
and
who
taking
the
form
of
a
dwarf
deceived
king
bali
and
who
taking
monkeys
with
him
bridged
the
ocean
and
who
supporting
the
mountain
go
vardhan
on
his
hand
protected
the
cowherds
from
the
bolts
of
indra
may
the
same
vasudeva
protect
you
on
hearing
this
the
king
inquired
whence
has
your
highness
come
the
brahman
mãldeva
replied
i
have
come
from
the
other
side
of
the
ganges
and
my
home
is
there
and
i
had
gone
to
bring
away
my
son
s
wife
and
in
my
absence
a
general
flight
from
the
village
took
place
and
so
i
know
not
whither
my
wife
and
son
have
fled
to
and
now
with
this
girl
with
me
how
shall
i
seek
them
it
is
therefore
advisable
that
i
leave
this
girl
with
your
majesty
keep
her
with
the
greatest
care
until
i
ball
was
a
powerful
king
who
by
his
austerities
and
devotion
overcame
indra
in
battle
and
obtained
power
over
heaven
and
earth
the
gods
became
alarmed
at
this
and
sought
the
aid
of
vishnü
who
visited
the
earth
in
the
form
of
a
dwarf
and
went
before
bali
who
according
to
custom
offered
him
presents
these
the
dwarf
affecting
utter
contempt
for
worldly
wealth
declined
saying
he
merely
wanted
as
much
territory
as
could
be
comprised
in
three
of
his
paces
bali
laughed
and
granted
his
request
whereupon
the
dwarf
increased
his
stature
to
prodigious
dimensions
and
at
one
step
placed
his
foot
on
the
heavens
at
the
next
on
the
earth
and
no
room
remaining
for
the
third
step
he
placed
his
foot
on
bali
s
head
and
so
pressed
him
down
to
the
region
of
beneath
the
earth
where
he
was
kept
in
confinement
and
bound
with
bonds
made
of
twisted
serpents
etband
from
the
sanskrit
signifies
a
dike
or
bridge
and
is
applied
to
the
ridge
of
rooks
between
the
coromandel
coast
and
ceylon
this
dike
or
bridge
is
said
to
have
been
built
by
the
allies
of
rama
the
monkey
army
under
the
leadership
of
hanuman
when
he
invaded
ceylon
to
recover
his
wife
sltã
who
had
been
carried
off
thither
by
bãvan
it
is
said
that
as
fast
as
the
monkeys
built
up
the
dike
bãvan
destroyed
it
so
to
prevent
his
doing
this
bãma
erected
a
temple
to
shiva
the
god
adored
by
bavan
at
the
extremity
of
the
dike
thenceforth
setband
rãmeshwar
became
a
place
of
pilgrimage
this
allusion
to
the
exploits
of
krishna
the
curious
reader
will
find
fully
explained
in
the
chapter
of
the
prem
on
hearing
these
words
of
the
brahman
s
the
king
began
thinking
to
himself
how
shall
i
take
charge
of
a
very
beautiful
young
woman
and
if
i
do
not
take
her
this
brahman
will
curse
me
and
my
dominion
will
be
having
thought
this
over
in
his
mind
the
king
said
your
highness
the
command
you
have
given
me
shall
be
on
this
the
king
summoned
his
daughter
and
said
daughter
take
this
brahman
s
and
keep
her
with
you
with
all
care
and
attention
and
whether
sleeping
or
waking
eating
or
drinking
or
moving
about
do
not
let
her
be
away
from
you
for
a
on
hearing
this
the
princess
took
hold
of
the
hand
of
the
brahman
s
and
led
her
away
to
her
own
apartment
at
night
the
two
slept
in
one
bed
and
began
conversing
with
each
other
in
the
course
of
conversation
the
brahman
s
said
tell
me
o
princess
to
what
trouble
is
it
owing
that
you
have
become
so
worn
and
feeble
the
princess
said
i
went
one
day
in
the
spring
accompanied
by
my
female
friends
to
stroll
about
in
the
garden
and
there
beheld
a
very
handsome
brahman
and
our
eyes
met
he
swooned
away
on
one
side
and
i
became
unconscious
on
the
other
then
my
companions
seeing
my
predicament
brought
me
home
and
i
am
totally
ignorant
of
both
his
name
and
his
abode
his
image
fills
my
eyes
and
i
have
not
the
least
desire
for
food
and
drink
it
is
through
this
trouble
that
my
body
has
been
reduced
to
the
state
you
on
hearing
this
the
brahman
s
said
what
wilt
thou
give
me
if
i
bring
thy
beloved
and
thee
together
the
princess
said
i
will
remain
thy
slave
for
hearing
this
he
took
the
magic
pill
out
of
his
mouth
and
became
a
man
again
and
she
was
abashed
at
beholding
him
after
that
the
brahman
s
son
married
her
after
the
fashion
of
gandharb
marriages
and
used
constantly
to
convert
himself
thus
into
a
man
at
night
and
to
remain
a
woman
by
day
at
length
after
six
months
the
princess
became
they
say
that
one
day
the
king
went
with
his
whole
family
to
a
marriage
festival
at
his
minister
s
house
there
the
minister
s
son
beheld
that
brahman
s
son
disguised
as
a
woman
and
fell
in
love
as
soon
as
he
saw
her
or
him
and
began
to
say
to
a
friend
of
his
if
this
woman
does
not
become
mine
i
will
sacrifice
my
in
the
interval
the
king
having
partaken
of
the
feast
returned
to
the
palace
with
his
family
but
the
condition
of
the
minister
s
son
became
most
painful
through
the
anguish
of
separation
from
his
beloved
and
he
gave
up
food
and
water
seeing
this
state
of
his
his
friend
went
and
informed
the
minister
and
the
minister
on
hearing
the
story
went
and
said
to
the
king
your
majesty
love
for
that
brahman
s
has
brought
my
son
to
a
wretched
state
he
has
given
up
eating
and
drinking
if
you
would
kindly
give
the
brahman
s
to
me
his
life
would
be
on
hearing
this
the
king
said
angrily
thou
fool
it
is
not
the
nature
of
kings
to
do
such
a
wrong
hearken
is
it
right
to
give
away
to
another
that
which
is
given
in
trust
without
the
permission
of
the
person
making
over
the
trust
that
you
mention
this
matter
to
me
on
hearing
this
the
minister
returned
home
in
despair
but
perceiving
the
suffering
of
his
son
he
also
gave
up
meat
and
drink
when
three
days
passed
without
the
minister
s
eating
and
drinking
then
indeed
all
the
officials
combined
and
said
to
the
king
your
majesty
the
minister
s
son
is
in
a
precarious
state
and
in
the
event
of
his
dying
the
minister
too
will
not
survive
and
on
the
minister
s
dying
the
affairs
of
the
state
will
come
to
a
it
is
better
that
you
consent
to
that
which
we
hearing
this
the
king
gave
them
permission
to
speak
then
one
of
them
said
your
majesty
it
is
long
since
that
old
brahman
left
this
and
he
has
not
returned
god
knows
whether
he
is
dead
or
alive
it
is
therefore
right
that
you
give
that
brahman
s
to
the
minister
s
son
and
so
uphold
your
kingdom
and
should
he
return
you
can
give
him
villages
and
wealth
should
he
not
be
satisfied
with
this
get
his
son
married
to
another
maiden
and
let
him
on
hearing
this
the
king
sent
for
the
brahman
s
and
said
go
thou
to
the
house
of
my
minister
s
she
said
the
virtue
of
a
woman
is
destroyed
by
her
being
gifted
with
excessive
beauty
and
a
brahman
s
character
is
lost
by
his
serving
a
king
and
a
cow
is
ruined
by
grazing
in
remote
pastures
and
wealth
vanishes
on
meeting
with
after
saying
so
much
she
added
if
your
majesty
would
give
me
to
the
minister
s
son

this
matter
with
him
that
he
will
do
whatever

i
go
to

the
king
said
say
what
should
he
she
replied
your
majesty
i
am
a
brahman
woman
and
he
is
a
kshatri
by
caste
hence
it
is
best
that
he
first
perform
all
the
prescribed
pilgrimages
after
that
i
will
cohabit
with
when
he
heard
this
speech
the
king
sent
for
the
minister
s
son
and
said
to
him
go
thou
first
and
visit
all
the
places
of
pilgrimage
after
that
i
will
give
the
brahman
s
girl
to
thee
on
hearing
these
words
from
the
king
the
minister
s
son
said
your
majesty
let
her
go
and
take
up
her
abode
in
my
house
and
then
i
will
go
on
after
hearing
this
the
king
said
to
the
brahman
s
girl
if
thou
will
first
go
and
take
up
thy
abode
in
his
house
he
will
set
out
on
having
no
alternative
the
brahman
s
girl
went
at
the
king
s
bidding
and
took
up
her
abode
in
his
house
then
the
minister
s
son
said
to
his
wife
do
you
both
live
together
in
one
place
on
terms
of
the
greatest
affection
and
friendliness
and
on
no
account
quarrel
and
fight
with
each
other
and
never
go
to
a
strange
having
given
them
these
instructions
he
for
his
part
set
out
on
a
pilgrimage
and
here
at
home
his
wife
whose
name
was
lying
at
night
on
one
bed
along
with
the
brahman
s
began
conversing
on
various
topics
after
some
time
the
wife
of
the
minister
s
son
spake
as
follows
o
friend
at
this
moment
i
am
consumed
with
the
flame
of
love
but
how
can
my
desire
be
attained
the
other
said
if
i
accomplish
thy
desire
what
wilt
thou
give
me
she
replied
i
will
be
thy
humble
and
obedient
slave
for
on
this
he
took
the
magic
pill
out
of
his
mouth
and
became
transformed
into
a
man
thus
he
regularly
transformed
himself
into
a
man
by
night
and
into
a
woman
by
day
after
that
indeed
great
love
existed
between
the
two
of
in
short
six
months
passed
away
in
this
manner
and
the
minister
s
son
returned
on
the
one
hand
the
people
hearing
of
his
arrival
began
to
rejoice
and
on
the
other
the
brahman
s
having
taken
the
magic
pill
out
of
her
mouth
and
transformed
herself
into
a
man
came
out
from
the
house
by
way
of
the
wicket
and
went
off
again
after
some
time
he
came
to
the
same
brahman
müldeva
who
had
given
him
the
magic
pill
and
told
him
his
whole
story
from
beginning
to
end
then
müldeva
after
hearing
all
the
circumstances
took
the
magic
pill
from
him
and
gave
it
to
his
companion
shashi
and
each
of
them
put
the
pill
he
had
into
his
mouth
one
was
transformed
into
an
old
man
and
the
other
a
young
man
of
twenty
after
this
the
two
went
to
the
king
the
king
saluted
them
on
the
instant
of
seeing
them
and
gave
them
seats
and
they
too
gave
the
king
their
blessings
after
inquiring
after
their
health
and
welfare
the
king
spake
to
müldeva
saying
where
have
you
been
detained
for
so
many
days
the
brahman
said
your
majesty
i
went
to
search
for
this
son
of
mine
and
having
discovered
him
i
have
brought
him
to
you
if
you
will
now
give
up
his
wife
i
will
take
both
and
son
then
the
king
related
the
whole
story
to
the
brahman
the
brahman
became
very
angry
on
hearing
it
and
said
to
the
king
what
proceeding
is
this
for
thee
to
give
my
son
s
wife
to
another
well
thou
hast
acted
as
thou
pleasedst
but
now
receive
my
thereupon
the
king
said
o
holy
man
be
not
angry
i
will
do
whatever
you
bid
the
brahman
said
so
be
it
if
through
fear
of
my
curse
thou
wilt
do
as
i
say
then
give
thy
daughter
in
marriage
to
my
on
hearing
this
the
king
summoned
an
astrologer
and
after
having
the
auspicious
conjunction
and
moment
determined
gave
his
daughter
in
marriage
to
the
brahman
s
son
then
he
took
leave
of
the
king
and
came
to
his
own
village
bringing
the
princess
together
with
her
dowry
along
with
on
hearing
this
intelligence
the
brahman
manswi
also
came
there
and
commenced
quarrelling
with
him
saying
give
me
my
the
brahman
named
shashi
said
i
have
married
her
before
ten
witnesses
and
brought
her
home
she
is
my
he
replied
she
is
with
child
by
me
how
can
she
become
thy
wife
and
they
went
on
wrangling
with
each
other
müldeva
reasoned
much
with
both
of
them
but
neither
heeded
what
he
after
relating
so
much
of
the
story
the
sprite
said
say
king
bir
vikramajit
whose
wife
was
she
the
king
replied
she
became
the
wife
of
the
brahman
then
the
sprite
said
pregnant
by
the
other
brahman
how
could
she
become
the
wife
of
this
one
the
king
said
no
one
was
aware
of
her
being
with
child
by
that
brahman
whereas
this
one
married
her
in
the
presence
of
ten
arbitrators
therefore
she
became
his
wife
and
the
child
too
will
have
the
right
to
perform
his
funeral
on
hearing
this
the
sprite
went
and
hung
on
to
the
same
tree
again
did
the
king
go
and
after
binding
the
sprite
and
placing
him
on
his
shoulder
carry
him
away
tale
xv
the
sprite
said
o
king
there
is
a
mountain
named
himachal
where
there
is
a
city
of
the
or
celestial
musicians
and
king
jïmütketu
ruled
there
once
upon
a
time
he
worshipped
kalpãbriksh
a
great
deal
for
the
sake
of
a
son
thereupon
kalpabriksh
was
pleased
and
said
i
am
pleased
at
perceiving
thy
services
to
me
ask
any
boon
thou
the
monarch
replied
saying
grant
me
a
son
so
that
my
kingdom
and
my
name
may
endure
it
the
tree
stud
even
so
shall
it
after
some
time
the
king
had
a
son
he
experienced
extreme
joy
and
held
rejoicings
with
much
noise
and
display
after
making
numerous
presents
and
charitable
gifts
he
summoned
the
priests
and
fixed
on
a
name
for
him
the
priests
named
him
when
he
became
twelve
years
of
age
he
began
to
worship
shiva
and
having
completed
the
study
of
all
the
learned
writings
became
a
very
intelligent
meditative
resolute
intrepid
and
learned
man
there
was
no
equal
of
his
in
those
times
and
as
many
people
as
dwelt
under
his
sway
all
were
alive
to
their
respective
when
he
attained
to
manhood
he
too
worshipped
kalpabriksh
assiduously
whereupon
kalpabriksh
was
pleased
and
said
to
him
ask
whatsoever
thou
desirest
i
will
give
it
to
on
this
said
if
you
are
pleased
with
me
take
away
all
poverty
from
my
subjects
and
let
all
those
who
dwell
in
my
dominions
become
equal
in
point
of
possessions
and
when
kalpabriksh
granted
the
boon
all
became
so
well
off
by
the
possession
of
wealth
that
no
one
would
obey
the
order
of
any
person
and
no
one
would
do
work
for
any
when
the
subjects
of
that
realm
became
such
as
has
been
described
the
brothers
and
kinsfolk
of
the
king
began
to
reason
together
saying
both
father
and
son
are
completely
under
the
influence
of
religion
and
the
people
do
not
obey
their
commands
it
is
therefore
best
to
seize
and
imprison
the
pair
of
them
and
take
their
kingdom
from
in
fine
the
king
was
not
on
his
guard
against
them
and
they
having
plotted
together
went
with
an
army
and
surrounded
the
king
s
when
this
news
reached
the
king
he
said
to
his
son
what
shall
we
do
now
the
prince
said
your
majesty
you
be
pleased
to
abide
here
in
peace
i
will
away
and
destroy
them
this
the
king
said
o
son
this
body
is
frail
and
riches
too
are
unabiding
when
a
man
is
born
death
too
attends
him
hence
we
should
now
give
up
dominion
and
practise
religious
duties
it
is
not
right
to
commit
a
heinous
sin
for
the
sake
of
such
a
body
and
for
the
sake
of
a
kingdom
for
even
king
yudhishthir
experienced
remorse
after
his
great
war
with
the
descendants
of
on
hearing
this
his
son
said
so
be
it
make
over
the
government
to
your
kinsmen
and
you
yourself
depart
and
practise
religious
having
resolved
on
this
and
summoned
his
brothers
and
nephews
and
handed
over
the
government
to
them
father
and
son
both
ascended
the
mountain
malayãchal
and
on
reaching
the
summit
built
a
hut
and
dwelt
there
a
friendship
arose
between
and
a
holy
sage
s
son
one
day
the
king
s
son
and
the
son
of
the
sage
went
out
together
for
a
stroll
on
the
top
of
the
mountain
a
temple
sacred
to
bhawãnï
came
in
sight
there
within
the
temple
a
princess
with
a
lute
in
her
hands
was
singing
in
front
of
the
goddess
the
eyes
of
the
princess
and
those
of
met
and
both
became
smitten
with
love
but
the
princess
restraining
her
feelings
and
stricken
with
shame
turned
her
steps
homeward
and
he
too
for
his
part
being
put
to
shame
by
the
presence
of
the
sage
s
son
came
to
his
own
place
that
night
was
passed
by
both
the
lovers
rosecheeked
ones
in
extreme
as
soon
as
morn
appeared
the
princess
set
out
from
her
quarter
for
the
temple
of
devi
and
the
prince
too
starting
from
this
side
no
sooner
arrived
than
he
perceived
that
the
princess
was
there
then
he
asked
her
female
companion
whose
daughter
is
she
the
companion
said
she
is
the
daughter
of
king
malayketu
her
name
is
malayãvatï
and
she
is
a
virgin
as
after
saying
this
the
companion
spoke
again
and
asked
the
prince
say
handsome
man
whence
have
you
come
and
what
is
your
name
he
replied
i
am
the
son
of
the
monarch
of
the
whose
name
is
and
my
name
is
in
consequence
of
our
government
being
overthrown
we
father
and
son
have
come
and
taken
up
our
abode
again
the
companion
after
hearing
these
words
related
all
to
the
princess
she
was
much
pained
at
heart
on
hearing
them
and
returned
home
and
at
night
she
lay
down
with
a
load
of
care
on
her
mind
but
her
companion
perceiving
this
state
of
her
s
disclosed
the
story
to
her
mother
the
queen
on
hearing
it
mentioned
it
to
the
king
and
said
your
majesty
your
daughter
has
become
marriageable
why
do
you
not
seek
a
husband
for
her
on
hearing
this
the
king
thought
the
matter
over
in
his
mind
and
that
very
moment
summoned
his
son
mitrãvasu
and
said
son
seek
a
husband
for
your
sister
and
bring
him
then
he
spoke
saying
the
king
of
the
by
name
and
whose
son
is
named
having
abandoned
his
kingdom
has
i
hear
come
here
with
his
on
hearing
this
king
said
i
will
give
the
girl
to
having
said
this
he
bade
his
son
go
and
bring
from
the
king
s
he
on
receipt
of
the
king
s
command
set
out
for
that
house
and
on
arriving
there
said
to
the
father
let
your
son
accompany
me
as
my
father
has
sent
for
him
to
bestow
his
daughter
upon
on
hearing
this
king
sent
his
son
along
with
him
and
he
came
here
to
king
s
house
then
king
celebrated
his
marriage
gandharb
fashion
when
his
marriage
had
taken
place
he
brought
the
bride
and
mitrãvasu
with
him
to
his
own
house
then
the
three
of
them
paid
their
respects
to
the
king
and
the
king
also
gave
them
his
blessing
thus
did
that
day
on
the
morrow
s
mom
however
the
two
princes
went
out
as
soon
as
they
rose
to
take
a
walk
on
that
mountain
of
malayãgir
on
reaching
the
place
what
does
perceive
but
a
very
lofty
heap
of
something
white
thereupon
he
questioned
his
saying
brother
how
is
it
that
this
white
heap
is
seen
here
he
replied
millions
of
young
or
serpents
with
human
faces
come
here
from
the
infernal
regions
these
comes
and
devours
this
heap
is
composed
of
their
on
hearing
this
jïmüt
bãhan
said
to
his
friend
you
go
home
alone
and
take
your
food
for
i
always
engage
in
worship
at
this
hour
and
the
time
for
me
to
worship
has
now
this
mountain
has
already
been
called
malayachal
the
change
of
name
is
merely
apparent
however
for
achal
and
giri
both
signify
mil
or
mountain
malaya
is
the
actual
name
it
is
a
mountain
south
of
the
narbada
and
is
made
famous
in
sanskrit
poetry
for
the
cool
southerly
breeze
which
always
prevails
there
garur
is
a
gigantic
bird
with
a
human
face
said
to
be
the
vehicle
of
vishnu
he
is
the
elder
brother
of
indra
being
the
produce
of
the
second
egg
laid
by
banitã
this
will
account
for
garur
s
possessing
the
power
to
bring
nectar
from
the
nether
regions
on
hearing
this
he
did
go
and
having
advanced
further
the
sound
of
weeping
began
to
reach
him
when
continuing
his
advance
in
the
direction
of
the
sound
of
the
voice
he
reached
the
spot
what
does
he
behold
but
an
old
woman
weeping
with
the
burden
of
her
trouble
he
went
up
to
her
and
asked
why
weepest
thou
mother
thereupon
she
said
comes
the
turn
of
the
serpent
sankhchür
who
is
my
son
garur
will
come
and
eat
him
up
it
is
on
account
of
this
trouble
that
i
he
said
o
mother
weep
not
i
will
give
up
my
life
in
lieu
of
thy
son
the
old
woman
said
pray
do
not
so
art
my
son
she
was
saying
this
when
at
that
moment
sankhchür
arrived
and
hearing
her
words
said
your
majesty
worthless
wretches
like
myself
are
born
and
die
in
vast
numbers
but
a
just
and
compassionate
being
like
you
is
not
born
every
day
every
hour
do
not
therefore
sacrifice
your
life
for
mine
for
thousands
of
human
beings
will
be
benefited
by
your
remaining
alive
whereas
it
makes
no
difference
whether
i
live
or
then
said
it
is
not
the
way
of
true
men
to
say
that
they
will
do
a
thing
and
then
not
to
do
it
go
thou
whence
thou
when
he
heard
this
shankhchur
for
his
part
went
to
pay
adoration
to
devi
and
garur
descended
from
the
sky
in
the
meantime
the
prince
perceived
that
each
leg
of
his
was
as
long
as
four
bamboos
and
his
beak
was
as
long
as
a
his
belly
like
a
mountain
his
eyes
like
gates
and
his
feathers
like
clouds
all
at
once
he
rushed
with
open
beak
upon
the
prince
the
first
time
the
prince
saved
himself
but
the
second
time
he
flew
off
with
him
in
his
beak
and
began
wheeling
upwards
in
the
air
while
this
was
going
on
a
bracelet
on
the
jewel
of
which
the
prince
s
name
was
engraved
became
unfastened
and
fell
all
covered
with
blood
before
the
princess
she
fell
down
in
a
swoon
at
the
sight
of
when
after
a
few
minutes
she
recovered
her
senses
she
sent
word
of
all
that
had
happened
to
her
father
and
mother
they
came
to
her
on
hearing
of
this
calamity
and
on
seeing
the
ornament
covered
with
blood
burst
into
tears
now
the
three
of
them
set
out
in
quest
of
him
and
on
the
road
shankhchür
too
joined
them
and
advancing
beyond
them
went
to
the
place
where
he
had
seen
the
prince
and
began
calling

him
go
let
him
go
he

shankchür
i
am
thy
on
hearing
this
garur
descended
in
alarm
and
thought
to
himself
i
have
eaten
either
a
brahman
or
a
kshatri
what
is
this
i
have
done
after
this
he
said
to
the
prince
o
man
tell
me
truly
why
art
thou
giving
up
thy
life
the
prince
replied
o
garur
trees
cast
their
shade
over
others
and
while
they
themselves
stand
in
the
sun
blossom
and
bear
fruit
for
the
benefit
of
others
such
is
the
character
of
good
men
and
trees
what
is
the
advantage
of
this
body
if
it
do
not
come
of
use
to
others
the
saying
is
well
known
that
the
more
they
rub
the
more
it
gives
out
its
perfume
and
the
more
they
go
on
peeling
the
and
cutting
it
up
into
pieces
the
more
does
its
flavour
increase
and
the
more
they
pass
gold
through
the
fire
the
more
surpassingly
beautiful
does
it
become
those
who
are
noble
do
not
give
up
their
natural
qualities
even
on
losing
their
lives
what
matters
it
whether
men
praise
them
or
blame
them
what
matters
it
whether
riches
abide
with
them
or
not
what
does
it
signify
whether
they
die
this
moment
or
after
a
length
of

the

who
walk
in
the

rectitude
place
not
their

in
any
other

happen
what
may
what
matters
it
whether
they
are
fat
or
lean
in
fact
his
living
is
bootless
whose
body
proves
of
no
benefit
to
anyone
while
those
who
live
for
the
good
of
others
their
living
is
advantageous
to
live
for
the
mere
sake
of
living
is
the
way
in
which
dogs
and
crows
even
cherish
life
those
who
lay
down
their
lives
for
the
sake
of
a
brahman
a
cow
a
friend
or
a
wife
nay
more
for
the
sake
of
a
stranger
assuredly
dwell
in
paradise
for
garur
said
everyone
in
the
world
cherishes
his
own
life
and
scarce
indeed
are
those
in
the
world
who
lay
down
their
own
lives
to
save
the
lives
of
after
saying
this
garur
added
ask
a
boon
i
am
pleased
with
thy
on
hearing
this
said
o
god
if
you
are
pleased
with
me
then
henceforth
eat
no
more
serpents
and
restore
to
life
those
you
have
on
hearing
this
garur
brought
the
water
of
life
from
the
infernal
regions
and
sprinkled
it
over
the
bones
of
the
serpents
so
that
they
rose
up
alive
again
and
he
said
to
him
the
prince
o
by
my
favour
thy
lost
kingdom
will
be
restored
to
after
granting
this
boon
garur
departed
to
his
own
abode
and
sankhchür
also
went
home
and
too
left
the
place
and
met
his
and
and
wife
on
the
road
then
he
came
in
their
company
to
his
father
when
they
heard
of
these
circumstances
his
uncle
and
cousins
and
indeed
all
his
kinsfolk
came
to
visit
him
and
after
falling
at
his
feet
to
implore
forgiveness
took
him
away
and
placed
him
on
the
after
relating
so
much
of
the
story
the
sprite
asked
o
king
whose
virtue
was
greatest
among
these
king
bïr
vikramãjït
replied
sankhchür
how
so
asked
the
sprite
the
king
said
sankhchür
who
had
gone
away
and
so
got
safe
off
returned
to
give
up
his
life
and
saved
him
the
prince
from
being
eaten
by
the
sprite
said
why
was
not
the
virtue
of
him
greatest
who
laid
down
his
life
for
another
the
king
replied
was
a
by
caste
he
was
accustomed
to
holding
his
life
in
his
hand
and
hence
he
found
it
no
hard
matter
to
sacrifice
his
on
hearing
this
the
sprite
went
again
and
hung
on
to
that
tree
and
the
king
having
gone
there
and
bound
him
placed
him
on
his
shoulder
and
carried
him
off
tale
xvi
the
sprite
said
ô
king
bir
vikramãjït
there
is
city
named
and
a
merchant
named
ratandatt
was
an
inhabitant
thereof
he
had
one
only
daughter
whose
name
was
unmãdinï
when
she
attained
to
womanhood
her
father
went
to
the
king
of
the
place
and
said
your
majesty
i
have
a
daughter
there
is
a
girl
in
my
house
if
you
desire
to
possess
her
take
her
otherwise
i
will
give
her
to
some
one
when
the
king
heard
this
he
summoned
two
or
three
old
servants
and
said
to
them
go
and
inspect
the
appearance
of
the
merchant
s
they
came
to
the
merchant
s
house
at
the
monarch
s
bidding
and
all
became
fascinated
at
the
sight
of
the
girl
s
beauty
such
beauty
as
if
a
brilliant
light
was
placed
in
a
dark
house
eyes
like
those
of
a
gazelle
plaits
of
hair
like
female
snakes
eyebrows
like
a
bow
nose
like
a
parrot
s
a
set
of
teeth
the
set
of
like
a
string
of
pearls
lips
like
the
throat
like
a
pigeon
s
waist
like
the
leopard
s
hands
and
feet
like
a
tender
lotus
a
face
like
the
moon
a
complexion
of
the
colour
of
the
a
gait
like
that
of
a
goose
and
a
voice
like
the
cuckoo
s
at
the
sight
of
her
beauty
the
female
divinities
of
indra
s
paradise
would
feel
on
beholding
beauty
of
this
kind
so
abundantly
rich
in
all
graces
they
decided
among
themselves
saying
if
such
a
woman
enter
the
king
s
household
the
king
will
become
her
slave
and
will
not
give
a
thought
to
the
affairs
of
government
hence
it
is
better
to
tell
the
king
that
she
is
and
not
worthy
of
having
determined
thus
they
came
thence
to
the
king
and
gave
the
following
account
we
have
seen
the
girl
she
is
not
worthy
of
on
hearing
this
the
king
said
to
the
merchant
i
will
not
wed
thereupon
what
does
the
merchant
do
on
returning
home
but
give
his
daughter
in
marriage
to
one
balbhadra
who
was
the
commander
of
the
king
s
army
she
took
up
her
abode
in
his
it
is
said
that
one
day
the
royal
cavalcade
passed
by
that
way
and
she
too
was
standing
fully
attired
on
her
at
the
moment
and
her
eyes
and
those
of
the
monarch
chanced
to
meet
the
king
began
to
say
to
himself
is
this
the
daughter
of
a
god
or
a
female
divinity
or
the
daughter
of
a
human
being
the
short
of
it
is
he
was
fascinated
at
the
sight
of
her
beauty
and
returned
thence
to
his
palace
in
a
state
of
extreme
agitation
the
warder
on
beholding
his
countenance
said
your
majesty
what
bodily
pain
are
you
suffering
from
the
monarch
replied
while
coming
along
the
road
i
saw
a
beautiful
woman
on
a
i
know
not
whether
she
is
a
houri
or
a
fairy
or
a
human
being
but
her
beauty
drove
my
mind
distracted
all
at
once
and
hence
it
is
that
i
am
on
hearing
this
the
said
your
majesty
she
is
the
daughter
of
that
same
merchant
who
offered
his
daughter
to
you
balbbadra
your
majesty
s
has
brought
her
home
as
his
the
king
said
those
whom
i
sent
to
see
her
appearance
have
deceived
me
after
saying
this
the
king
ordered
the
to
bring
those
persons
before
him
without
delay
on
receiving
this
order
from
the
king
the
went
and
brought
them
in
short
when
they
came
before
the
king
his
majesty
said
the
errand
on
which
i
sent
you
and
that
which
was
the
desire
of
my
heart
these
things
you
failed
to
accomplish
on
the
contrary
you
fabricated
a
false
story
and
gave
it
to
me
as
an
answer
now
i
have
seen
her
with
my
own
eyes
she
is
so
beautiful
a
woman
rich
in
all
distinguishing
qualities
that
it
would
be
difficult
to
meet
with
her
equal
in
these
on
hearing
this
they
said
what
your
majesty
says
is
true
but
graciously
listen
to
the
object
we
had
in
view
in
representing
her
to
your
majesty
as
we
decided
among
ourselves
that
if
so
beautiful
a
woman
enter
the
royal
household
your
majesty
would
become
her
slave
on
the
instant
of
beholding
her
and
would
neglect
all
the
affairs
of
the
state
and
so
the
kingdom
would
go
to
ruin
it
was
in
consequence
of
this
apprehension
that
we
invented
such
a
story
and
laid
it
before
when
he
heard
this
the
king
to
them
you
speak
the
truth
but
he
experienced
the
greatest
uneasiness
thinking
of
her
now
the
king
s
distress
of
mind
was
known
to
everyone
when
at
the
moment
balbhadra
too
arrived
and
putting
his
hands
together
in
humble
supplication
stood
before
the
king
and
said
o
lord
of
the
earth
i
am
your
servant
she
is
your
and
you
to
suffer
so
much
pain
on
her
account
be
pleased
therefore
to
give
the
order
that
she
may
be
brought
before
on
hearing
these
words
the
king
said
very
angrily
it
is
a
grievous
wrong
to
approach
another
s
wife
what
is
this
thou
hast
said
to
me
what
am
i
a
lawless
wretch
that
i
should
commit
an
infamous
deed
the
wife
of
another
is
as
a
mother
and
the
wealth
of
another
is
on
a
par
with
mud
hear
me
brother
as
a
man
regards
his
own
heart
so
should
he
regard
the
hearts
of
balbhadra
spoke
again
saying
she
is
my
servant
when
i
give
her
to
your
majesty
how
can
she
any
longer
be
the
wife
of
another
the
king
replied
i
will
not
commit
an
act
whereby
reproach
would
attach
to
me
in
the
the
said
again
your
majesty
i
will
turn
her
out
of
the
house
and
place
her
somewhere
else
and
after
making
a
prostitute
of
her
will
bring
her
to
thereupon
the
monarch
said
if
thou
makest
a
harlot
of
a
virtuous
woman
i
will
punish
thee
after
saying
this
the
king
pined
at
the
recollection
of
her
and
in
the
course
of
ten
days
died
then
the
balbhadra
went
and
asked
his
spiritual
teacher
my
master
has
died
for
the
sake
of
unmadini
what
is
it
right
for
me
to
do
now
favour
me
with
your
commands
in
this
he
said
it
is
the
duty
of
a
servant
to
give
up
his
life
also
after
his
master
this
servant
gladly
went
to
the
place
where
they
had
conveyed
the
king
for
cremation
during
the
time
in
which
the
king
s
funeral
pile
was
got
ready
he
too
had
quitted
himself
of
his
ablutions
and
devotions
and
when
they
lighted
the
pile
he
too
drew
near
the
pile
and
raising
his
joined
hands
to
the
sun
began
to
say
o
in
thought
word
and
deed
i
solicit
the
gratification
of
this
desire
that
at
every
successive
birth
i
may
meet
with
this
same
master
and
for
this
hymn
your
having
uttered
this
he
bowed
in
adoration
and
leaped
into
the
when
unmãdini
received
this
intelligence
she
went
to
her
spiritual
teacher
and
telling
him
all
asked
saying
your
highness
what
is
the
duty
of
a
wife
he
replied
it
is
by
doing
her
duty
to
him
to
whom
her
father
and
mother
have
given
her
that
she
is
termed
a
woman
of
good
family
and
it
is
thus
written
in
the
book
of
law
the
woman
who
in
her
husband
s
lifetime
practises
austerities
and
fasting
shortens
the
life
of
her
husband
and
is
finally
cast
into
the
best
thing
is
this
that
a
woman
by
doing
her
duty
to
her
husband
no
matter
how
wanting
he
may
be
secures
her
own
salvation
moreover
the
woman
who
entertains
the
desire
to
sacrifice
herself
for
her
husband
in
the
most
undoubtedly
derives
as
much
benefit
from
as
many
steps
as
she
takes
towards
this
as
would
be
derived
from
an
equal
number
of
further
there
is
no
virtue
equal
to
that
of
a
woman
s
sacrificing
herself
for
her
husband
on
the
funeral
on
hearing
this
she
made
her
salutation
and
returned
home
and
after
bathing
and
performing
her
devotions
and
giving
large
gifts
to
brahmans
went
to
the
funeral
pile
and
going
once
round
to
the
right
in
adoration
said
o
lord
i
am
thy
servant
in
each
succeeding
having
said
this
she
too
went
and
seated
herself
in
the
fire
and
was
the
ashwamedha
or
is
one
performed
by
powerful
kings
alone
as
it
involves
a
vast
expense
it
is
regarded
as
of
the
highest
efficacy
and
as
far
excelling
all
ordinary
sacrifices
after
relating
so
much
of
the
story
the
sprite
said
o
king
whose
virtue
was
greatest
of
these
three
king
bir
vikramãjït
replied
the
king
the
sprite
said
how
so
the
king
replied
he
left
alone
the
wife
given
to
him
by
the
while
he
sacrificed
his
life
on
her
account
and
yet
preserved
his
virtue
it
behoves
a
servant
to
lay
down
his
life
for
his
master
and
it
is
right
for
a
wife
to
sacrifice
herself
for
her
lord
therefore
the
virtue
of
the
king
was
having
heard
these
words
the
sprite
went
and
hung
on
to
that
same
tree
the
king
too
followed
him
and
again
bound
him
and
placed
him
on
his
shoulder
and
carried
him
away
tale
xvii
the
sprite
said
your
majesty
there
was
a
king
of
ujjain
named
mahãsain
and
an
inhabitant
of
that
place
was
a
brahman
devasharmã
whose
son
s
name
was
gunãkar
he
the
son
turned
out
a
great
gambler
so
much
so
that
he
lost
at
play
all
the
wealth
the
brahman
possessed
thereupon
all
the
members
of
the
family
turned
gunãkar
out
of
house
and
home
and
he
could
not
help
himself
in
any
way
so
having
no
other
resource
he
took
his
departure
from
the
place
and
in
several
days
time
came
to
a
certain
city
what
does
he
see
there
but
a
devotee
sitting
over
a
fire
and
inhaling
smoke
by
way
of
penance
after
saluting
him
he
too
sat
down
there
the
devotee
asked
him
wilt
thou
eat
anything
he
replied
your
highness
of
course
i
will
eat
if
you
give
me
something
the
devotee
filled
a
human
skull
with
food
and
brought
it
to
him
on
seeing
it
he
said
i
ll
not
eat
food
out
of
this
when
he
did
not
partake
of
the
food
the
ascetic
repeated
such
an
incantation
that
a
fairy
appeared
before
him
with
joined
hands
and
said
your
highness
i
will
execute
any
command
you
may
give
the
ascetic
said
give
this
brahman
whatever
food
he
on
hearing
this
she
built
a
very
fine
house
and
furnishing
it
with
all
comforts
took
him
away
with
her
from
that
place
and
seating
him
on
a
stool
placed
various
kinds
of
condiments
and
meats
by
dishfuls
before
him
he
ate
whatever
he
liked
to
his
heart
s
content
again
after
this
she
placed
the
before
him
and
after
rubbing
down
saffron
and
sandal
in
applied
the
mixture
to
his
body
farther
she
clothed
him
in
garments
scented
with
sweet
perfumes
threw
a
garland
of
flowers
round
his
neck
and
bringing
him
away
thence
seated
him
on
a
bed
now
while
this
was
taking
place
it
became
evening
and
she
too
having
first
decked
herself
out
went
and
sat
on
the
bed
and
the
brahman
passed
the
whole
night
in
pleasure
and
yakshani
is
a
female
yakshã
or
kind
of
attendant
on
kuvera
the
god
of
wealth
when
morn
arrived
the
fairy
went
away
to
her
own
place
and
he
came
to
the
devotee
and
said
master
she
s
gone
away
what
shall
i
do
now
the
ascetic
said
she
came
through
the
power
of
magic
art
and
abides
near
him
who
possesses
the
he
replied
impart
this
art
to
me
your
highness
that
i
may
practise
then
the
devotee
gave
him
a
charm
and
said
practise
this
charm
for
forty
days
at
midnight
sitting
in
water
and
with
a
steadfast
thus
used
he
to
go
to
practise
the
charm
while
many
and
various
frightful
objects
appeared
in
view
but
he
felt
no
alarm
at
any
of
them
when
the
time
expired
he
came
to
the
devotee
and
said
your
highness
i
come
from
practising
the
charm
for
the
number
of
days
you
he
said
now
practise
it
for
that
number
of
days
sitting
in
he
replied
master
i
will
go
and
pay
a
visit
to
my
family
and
then
return
and
practise
after
saying
this
to
the
devotee
he
took
leave
and
went
home
and
when
his
relations
saw
him
they
embraced
him
and
commenced
weeping
while
his
father
said
o
gunãkar
where
have
you
been
so
many
days
and
why
did
you
forget
your
home
o
my
son
it
is
said
that
he
who
leaves
a
faithful
wife
and
lives
apart
and
turns
his
back
on
a
youthful
woman
or
he
who
does
not
care
for
one
who
loves
him
is
on
a
level
with
the
lowest
of
the
low
it
is
said
farther
that
no
virtue
equals
the
domestic
virtues
and
no
woman
in
the
world
imparts
happiness
equal
to
that
which
the
mistress
of
one
s
house
imparts
and
those
who
slight
their
parents
are
impious
men
and
their
future
state
will
never
never
be
one
of
salvation
thus
has
brahma
lit
is
equal
to
a
chandil
or
man
of
the
lowest
of
the
mixed
tribes
on
this
spoke
saying
this
body
is
composed
of
flesh
and
blood
which
same
is
food
for
worms
and
its
nature
is
such
that
if
you
neglect
it
for
a
day
a
fetid
smell
proceeds
from
it
fools
are
they
who
feel
affection
for
such
a
body
and
wise
are
they
who
set
not
their
heart
on
it
further
it
is
of
the
nature
of
this
body
that
it
is
repeatedly
born
and
destroyed
what
dependence
can
one
place
on
such
a
body
cleanse
it
ever
so
much
it
does
not
become
clean
just
as
an
earthen
vessel
filled
with
filth
does
not
become
clean
by
washing
the
outer
surface
or
however
much
one
washes
charcoal
it
does
not
become
white
again
by
what
means
can
that
body
become
clean
in
which
the
fount
of
impurity
is
having
said
so
much
he
spoke
again
saying
whose
father
is
one
whose
mother
whose
wife
whose
brother
the
way
of
this
world
is
such
that
numbers
come
and
numbers
depart
those
who
offer
sacrifices
and
consider
agni
fire
their
god
while
those
who
are
deficient
in
understanding
make
an
image
and
worship
it
as
god
but
the
class
of
ascetics
regard
god
as
in
their
very
bodies
i
will
not
practise
such
domestic
duties
as
those
you
have
mentioned
but
will
practise
religious
having
said
this
he
bid
adieu
to
his
kindred
and
came
where
the
devotee
was
and
practised
the
charm
seated
in
fire
the
fairy
however
did
not
come
then
he
went
to
the
devotee
and
the
devotee
said
to
him
hast
thou
not
acquired
the
art
thereupon
he
said
just
so
master
i
have
not
acquired
it
this
may
also
be
rendered
who
has
a
father
yogãbhyãs
may
mean
either
the
particular
practice
of
devotion
by
which
union
with
god
is
supposed
to
be
obtained
or
the
practice
of
the
magic
having
related
so
much
of
the
story
the
sprite
said
say
o
king
why
did
he
not
acquire
the
art
the
king
replied
saying
the
practiser
was
of
two
minds
i
did
not
give
his
undivided
attention
to
the
task
and
hence
he
failed
to
acquire
it
and
it
is
said
that
a
spell
is
perfected
by
the
operator
s
being
of
one
mind
or
by
his
giving
his
entire
mind
to
it
and
does
not
succeed
on
his
thoughts
being
divided
further
it
is
also
said
that
those
who
are
wanting
in
liberality
do
not
obtain
celebrity
and
those
who
lack
truthfulness
are
without
shame
those
who
are
wanting
in
justice
do
not
acquire
wealth
and
those
who
lack
meditation
do
not
find
when
the
sprite
heard
this
he
said
how
can
the
operator
who
sat
in
fire
to
work
his
spell
be
termed
the
king
replied
when
at
the
time
of
practising
the
spell
he
went
to
visit
his
family
the
devotee
said
to
himself
in
vexation
why
did
i
teach
the
magic
art
to
so
vacillating
an
operator
and
it
was
in
consequence
of
this
that
he
did
not
acquire
the
art
and
it
is
said
that
however
much
a
man
may
exert
himself
destiny
attends
him
all
the
same
and
whatever
number
of
things
he
may
achieve
by
force
of
his
intellect
he
nevertheless
obtains
that
alone
which
fate
has
on
hearing
this
the
sprite
went
again
and
hung
on
to
that
tree
and
the
king
too
followed
him
and
having
bound
him
and
placed
him
on
his
shoulder
took
him
away
tale
xviii
the
sprite
said
your
majesty
there
was
a
city
named
kubalpur
the
name
of
the
king
of
which
was
sudakshi
now
a
merchant
named
dhanãkshi
used
also
to
live
in
that
city
and
he
had
a
daughter
whose
name
was
dhanvati
he
gave
her
in
marriage
in
her
childhood
to
a
merchant
named
gauridatt
after
a
considerable
time
she
had
a
girl
whom
she
named
mohani
when
she
attained
to
some
years
her
father
died
and
the
merchant
s
kinsfolk
seized
all
his
property
she
in
her
helplessness
left
the
house
in
the
darkness
of
the
night
and
taking
her
daughter
with
her
set
out
for
the
house
of
her
after
proceeding
but
a
short
distance
she
lost
the
road
and
came
upon
a
where
a
thief
was
stretched
upon
an
her
hand
quite
unexpectedly
came
in
contact
with
his
foot
he
called
out
who
is
it
that
put
me
to
pain
just
now
on
this
she
replied
i
have
not
willingly
inflicted
pain
on
you
forgive
my
he
said
no
one
gives
either
pain
or
pleasure
to
another
according
as
the
creator
decrees
one
s
fate
shall
be
so
he
experiences
and
those
who
affirm
that
they
did
such
and
such
things
are
very
unwise
for
men
are
fixed
to
the
cord
of
fate
which
draws
them
after
it
whithersoever
it
pleases
the
ways
of
the
creator
are
utterly
inscrutable
for
men
propose
a
thing
to
themselves
and
he
brings
something
quite
different
to
on
hearing
this
dhanvati
said
o
man
who
art
thou
he
replied
i
am
a
thief
this
is
my
third
day
on
the
and
life
will
not
quit
the
she
said
for
what
reason
he
replied
saying
i
am
unmarried
if
thou
wilt
give
me
thy
daughter
in
marriage
i
will
give
thee
ten
millions
of
it
is
notorious
that
greediness
of
gain
is
the
root
of
all
evil
pleasure
the
source
of
pain
and
love
the
source
of
sorrow
whoever
keeps
clear
of
these
three
lives
happy
it
is
not
every
one
however
who
can
give
them
up
eventually
dhanvati
through
greed
became
willing
to
give
him
her
daughter
and
asked
it
is
my
desire
that
thou
shouldst
have
a
son
but
how
can
this
be
he
replied
saying
when
she
attains
to
womanhood
send
for
a
handsome
brahman
and
give
him
five
hundred
and
place
her
with
him
thus
will
she
have
a
when
she
heard
this
dhanvati
married
the
girl
to
him
by
giving
her
four
turns
round
the
stake
then
the
thief
said
to
her
there
is
a
near
a
large
well
of
masonry
to
the
east
of
this
the
lie
buried
beneath
it
go
thou
and
take
he
said
this
and
died
she
went
in
the
direction
indicated
and
on
arriving
there
took
a
few
from
those
buried
and
came
to
her
parents
house
after
relating
her
story
to
them
she
brought
them
with
her
to
her
husband
s
land
then
she
built
a
large
house
and
began
living
in
it
and
the
girl
increased
in
stature
when
she
had
become
a
woman
she
was
standing
one
day
with
a
female
companion
on
the
and
casting
her
eyes
along
the
road
while
just
at
that
moment
a
young
brahman
passed
that
way
and
she
at
the
sight
of
him
was
smitten
with
love
and
said
to
her
friend
o
my
friend
bring
this
man
to
my
on
hearing
this
she
went
and
brought
the
brahman
to
her
mother
she
said
on
seeing
him
o
brahman
my
daughter
is
young
if
thou
wilt
lie
with
her
i
will
give
thee
a
hundred
for
a
on
hearing
this
he
said
i
will
do
whilst
they
were
conversing
thus
evening
came
on
they
gave
him
food
to
his
mind
and
he
supped
it
is
a
well
known
saying
that
enjoyment
is
of
eight
kinds
perfume
woman
apparel
song
food
the
couch
ornaments
all
these
existed
there
to
be
brief
when
the
first
watch
of
the
night
was
at
hand
or
was
nigh
passed
he
repaired
to
the
nuptial
chamber
and
spent
the
whole
night
in
pleasure
and
enjoyment
with
her
when
it
became
morning
he
went
home
and
she
arose
and
came
to
her
companions
then
one
of
them
enquired
say
what
pleasures
did
you
enjoy
with
your
love
in
the
night
she
replied
when
i
went
and
sat
near
him
a
kind
of
tremour
made
itself
felt
in
my
heart
but
when
he
smiled
and
took
hold
of
my
hand
i
was
quite
overcome
and
no
consciousness
of
what
took
place
remained
to
me
and
it
is
said
that
if
a
husband
be
possessed
of
renown
brave
clever
a
chief
liberal
endowed
with
good
qualities
a
protector
of
his
wife
such
a
man
a
wife
never
forgets
even
in
the
world
to
come
much
less
in
this
the
gist
of
the
story
is
that
on
that
very
night
she
conceived
when
the
full
time
came
a
boy
was
born
on
the
sixth
night
the
mother
saw
in
a
vision
an
ascetic
with
matted
hair
on
his
head
a
shining
moon
on
his
forehead
ashes
of
burnt
rubbed
over
him
wearing
a
white
brahminical
thread
seated
on
a
white
lotus
wearing
a
necklace
of
white
snakes
with
a
string
of
skulls
thrown
round
his
neck
and
with
a
skull
in
one
hand
and
a
trident
in
the
other
thus
assuming
a
most
terrifying
appearance
come
before
her
and
begin
to
say
at
midnight
place
a
bag
of
one
thousand
in
a
large
basket
and
enclosing
this
boy
therein
leave
it
at
the
gate
of
the
as
soon
as
she
saw
this
her
eyes
opened
and
on
its
becoming
morning
she
told
all
the
circumstances
to
her
mother
when
her
mother
heard
this
she
on
the
following
day
put
the
boy
in
a
basket
in
the
very
manner
directed
and
left
him
at
the
king
s
gate
now
here
at
the
palace
the
king
saw
an
apparition
with
ten
arms
five
heads
each
head
having
three
eyes
in
it
and
a
moon
upon
it
very
large
teeth
a
trident
in
his
hand
a
most
terrifying
form
which
came
before
him
and
said
o
king
a
basket
is
placed
at
thy
door
bring
away
the
child
that
is
in
it
he
it
is
who
will
maintain
thy
as
soon
as
the
king
heard
this
his
eyes
opened
he
then
related
the
whole
affair
to
the
queen
after
that
rising
up
thence
and
coming
to
the
door
he
perceived
the
basket
placed
there
on
the
instant
of
opening
the
basket
and
peering
into
it
he
beheld
a
boy
and
a
bag
of
one
thousand
in
it
he
took
up
the
child
himself
and
told
the
to
bring
in
the
bag
he
then
went
into
the
female
apartments
and
placed
the
child
on
the
queen
s
by
this
time
the
day
broke
the
king
came
out
and
summoning
the
sages
and
astrologers
questioned
them
saying
tell
me
what
marks
of
royalty
are
perceptible
in
this
child
thereupon
one
of
the
sages
who
was
acquainted
with
the
science
of
interpreting
the
spots
on
the
human
body
spoke
saying
your
majesty
three
marks
are
distinctly
perceived
on
this
child
a
broad
chest
a
high
forehead
a
large
face
in
addition
to
these
your
majesty
the
whole
marks
which
are
assigned
to
man
exist
in
this
one
have
no
apprehensions
on
his
account
he
will
rule
over
the
on
hearing
this
the
king
was
pleased
and
taking
off
a
chaplet
of
pearls
from
his
own
neck
presented
it
to
that
brahman
and
after
giving
large
gifts
to
all
the
brahmans
he
bade
them
name
the
child
then
the
sages
said
your
majesty
be
pleased
to
sit
down
with
the
queen
fastened
to
you
let
her
majesty
sit
with
the
child
in
her
lap
and
summon
all
the
musicians
singers
and
others
employed
on
festive
occasions
and
cause
rejoicings
to
take
place
then
will
we
give
him
a
name
after
the
manner
prescribed
by
the
sacred
when
the
monarch
heard
this
he
ordered
his
minister
to
do
whatever
they
bid
him
the
minister
had
rejoicings
for
the
birth
of
the
child
forthwith
proclaimed
throughout
the
city
on
hearing
this
all
the
professional
rejoicers
were
in
attendance
and
congratulatory
songs
rung
forth
from
every
home
festive
music
began
to
strike
up
in
the
king
s
palace
and
rejoicing
to
take
place
then
the
king
and
the
queen
with
the
child
in
her
lap
came
and
sat
within
a
square
filled
with
coloured
meal
perfumes
and
sweetmeats
and
the
brahmans
began
reading
the
scriptures
an
astrologer
from
among
the
brahmans
having
first
determined
the
auspicious
planetary
conjunction
and
time
named
the
child
hardatti
after
that
he
grew
daily
at
length
at
the
age
of
nine
years
he
finished
the
study
of
the
six
learned
volumes
and
fourteen
sciences
and
became
a
profound
scholar
in
the
meantime
according
to
what
was
willed
by
god
it
happened
that
his
father
and
mother
died
he
ascended
the
throne
and
began
to
govern
after
several
years
the
king
one
day
thought
to
himself
what
have
i
done
for
my
parents
in
return
for
being
born
in
their
family
the
saying
is
that
those
who
are
compassionate
deal
compassionately
with
all
they
it
is
who
are
wise
and
to
them
it
is
that
paradise
is
allotted
and
the
gifts
worship
religious
penances
pilgrimages
and
listening
to
the
scriptures
of
those
who
are
not
pure
of
heart
is
all
in
vain
and
those
who
perform
the
funeral
ceremonies
and
worship
of
the
manes
without
faith
and
in
pride
derive
no
advantage
thereby
and
so
their
fathers
go
with
their
desires
reflecting
and
pondering
on
this
matter
the
king
decided
that
he
ought
now
to
perform
the
funeral
ceremonies
of
his
fathers
thereupon
king
hardatt
proceeded
to
gayã
and
on
arriving
there
invoked
the
names
of
his
fathers
and
began
offering
oblations
to
them
on
the
bank
of
the
river
phalgü
when
the
hands
of
all
three
came
up
out
of
the
river
he
was
troubled
in
mind
on
seeing
this
wondering
to
which
of
the
hands
he
should
give
the
oblations
and
to
which
these
oblations
consist
of
balls
pind
or
lumps
of
meat
or
rice
mixed
up
with
milk
curds
flowers
that
is
the
thief
s
the
brahman
s
who
begat
him
and
the
king
s
who
adopted
him
the
hindus
believe
that
when
a
son
performs
the
ceremony
in
question
the
father
is
permitted
to
come
from
the
other
world
and
receive
the
oblation
having
reached
this
stage
of
the
story
the
sprite
said
o
king
vikram
to
which
of
the
three
was
it
right
to
give
the
oblations
then
the
king
said
to
the
the
sprite
said
again
for
what
reason
thereupon
he
the
king
said
the
seed
of
the
brahman
had
been
bought
and
the
king
took
a
thousand
gold
mohurs
and
brought
up
the
boy
and
therefore
neither
of
these
two
had
any
right
to
the
on
hearing
these
words
the
sprite
went
again
and
hung
on
to
that
tree
and
the
king
carried
him
away
bound
from
thence
tale
xix
the
sprite
said
o
king
there
is
a
city
named
chitraküt
the
king
of
which
was
rupdatt
one
day
he
mounted
his
horse
and
went
forth
alone
to
hunt
and
having
lost
his
way
got
into
a
great
forest
what
does
he
see
on
going
there
but
a
large
tank
in
which
lotuses
were
flowering
and
various
kinds
of
birds
were
sporting
on
all
four
sides
of
the
tank
cool
and
breezes
were
blowing
under
the
shade
of
the
dense
foliage
of
the
trees
he
for
his
part
was
overcome
with
the
heat
so
he
tied
his
horse
to
a
tree
and
spread
the
and
sat
down
a
or
so
had
passed
when
the
daughter
of
a
holy
sage
very
beautiful
and
in
the
prime
of
youth
came
to
gather
flowers
seeing
her
plucking
the
flowers
the
king
became
deeply
enamoured
when
she
was
returning
to
her
abode
after
gathering
the
flowers
the
king
said
what
conduct
is
this
of
yours
for
you
not
to
attend
to
me
when
i
have
come
as
a
guest
to
your
abode
on
hearing
this
she
stood
still
again
then
the
king
said
they
say
that
if
one
of
low
caste
come
as
a
guest
to
the
house
of
one
of
the
highest
caste
even
he
is
entitled
to
respect
and
whether
he
be
a
thief
or
an
outcast
or
an
enemy
or
a
parricide
if
such
a
one
even
comes
to
one
s
house
it
is
right
to
show
him
honour
for
a
guest
is
more
to
be
honoured
than
anyone
when
the
king
spoke
thus
she
stood
still
then
in
truth
the
two
began
to
ogle
one
another
in
the
meantime
the
holy
sage
also
came
up
the
king
saluted
the
devotee
on
seeing
him
and
he
in
return
blessed
him
saying
may
you
live
having
said
so
much
he
asked
the
king
why
have
you
come
here
he
replied
your
holiness
i
i
have
come
a
he
said
why
dost
thou
commit
a
great
sin
it
is
said
that
one
man
commits
a
sin
and
many
men
reap
the
fruits
the
king
said
your
holiness
kindly
favour
me
with
your
judgment
of
right
and
thereupon
the
sage
said
attend
your
majesty
a
great
wrong
is
done
in
killing
an
animal
that
lives
in
the
forest
supporting
itself
on
grass
and
water
and
it
is
a
very
meritorious
act
in
man
to
cherish
beasts
and
birds
it
is
said
moreover
that
those
who
render
unapprehensive
the
timid
and
receive
the
reward
of
those
who
are
most
liberal
givers
it
is
also
said
that
no
religious
austerity
equals
forbearance
and
no
happiness
equals
that
of
contentment
and
no
wealth
equals
friendship
and
there
is
no
virtue
like
mercy
moreover
those
men
who
are
conscious
of
their
duties
and
show
no
pride
on
acquiring
riches
accomplishments
learning
renown
or
supremacy
and
those
who
are
content
with
their
own
wives
and
are
such
men
obtain
final
salvation
hereafter
and
those
who
kill
ascetics
with
matted
hair
and
without
clothes
and
arms
experience
the
torments
of
hell
at
the
last
and
the
king
who
does
not
punish
the
oppressors
of
his
subjects
he
also
experiences
the
torments
of
hell
and
those
who
have
carnal
intercourse
with
a
king
s
wife
or
the
wife
or
daughter
of
a
friend
or
with
a
woman
eight
or
nine
months
advanced
in
pregnancy
they
are
cast
into
the
lowest
and
greatest
hell
of
all
thus
is
it
declared
in
the
book
of
law
and
the
text
has
tant
by
mistake
for
trin
on
hearing
this
the
monarch
said
the
sins
which
i
have
heretofore
committed
in
ignorance
are
done
and
are
beyond
recall
henceforth
god
willing
i
will
not
commit
such
the
holy
sage
was
pleased
at
the
king
s
speaking
thus
and
said
i
will
grant
thee
any
boon
thou
may
st
ask
for
i
am
highly
pleased
with
then
the
king
spoke
saying
your
holiness
if
you
are
pleased
with
me
give
me
your
when
the
sage
heard
this
he
married
his
daughter
to
the
king
after
the
manner
of
gandharb
marriages
and
departed
to
his
own
place
then
the
king
took
the
saint
s
daughter
and
set
out
for
his
capital
on
the
road
about
the
sun
set
and
the
moon
rose
then
the
king
seeing
a
shady
tree
alighted
beneath
it
and
tying
the
horse
to
its
root
spread
his
and
lay
down
along
with
her
thereupon
at
the
hour
of
midnight
a
demon
came
and
awoke
the
king
saying
o
king
i
will
devour
thy
the
king
said
act
not
so
whatever
thou
askest
for
i
will
then
the
demon
said
o
king
if
thou
wilt
cut
off
the
head
of
a
brahman
s
son
seven
years
old
and
give
it
to
me
with
thine
own
hand
i
will
not
eat
the
king
replied
even
so
will
i
do
but
do
thou
come
to
me
seven
days
hence
in
my
capital
and
i
will
give
it
having
bound
the
king
by
a
promise
thus
the
demon
departed
to
his
own
place
and
on
the
morn
arriving
the
king
also
left
and
came
to
his
palace
the
minister
hearing
of
it
i
the
king
s
arrival
made
great
rejoicings
and
came
and
presented
gifts
and
the
king
after
telling
the
minister
of
the
adventure
with
the
demon
asked
say
what
expedient
shall
we
adopt
in
the
matter
for
the
demon
will
come
on
the
seventh
day
the
minister
said
your
majesty
feel
no
anxiety
whatever
god
will
make
all
after
saying
so
much
the
minister
had
an
image
made
of
a
maund
and
a
quarter
of
gold
and
jewels
studded
therein
and
having
it
placed
on
a
cart
and
conveyed
away
and
set
up
at
a
point
where
four
roads
met
he
said
to
the
keepers
thereof
if
any
persons
come
to
look
at
this
say
to
them
that
any
brahman
who
will
allow
the
king
to
cut
off
the
head
of
a
son
of
his
may
take
possession
of
having
said
this
he
came
away
thereupon
the
keepers
used
to
say
this
to
those
who
came
to
look
at
it
the
image
two
days
passed
away
without
any
result
on
the
third
day
however
a
weakly
brahman
who
had
three
sons
hearing
of
this
matter
came
home
and
began
saying
to
his
wife
if
thou
wilt
give
a
son
of
thine
to
the
king
for
a
sacrifice
an
image
of
a
maund
and
a
quarter
of
gold
and
studded
with
jewels
will
come
into
the
on
hearing
this
his
wife
said
i
will
not
give
the
youngest
the
brahman
said
the
eldest
i
will
not
part
when
the
second
son
heard
this
he
said
father
give
me
he
replied
very
then
the
brahman
spoke
again
saying
wealth
it
is
which
is
the
source
of
all
happiness
in
this
world
now
what
happiness
can
reach
him
who
lacks
wealth
and
if
one
be
poor
his
coming
into
the
world
is
having
said
this
he
took
the
second
son
and
gave
him
up
to
the
guards
and
brought
away
the
image
to
his
house
and
the
people
for
their
part
took
the
boy
to
the
minister
further
when
seven
days
passed
away
the
demon
too
came
the
king
took
sandal
unbroken
rice
flowers
perfumes
lamps
food
for
the
deity
fruits
and
and
paid
adoration
to
him
and
summoning
the
boy
took
his
sword
in
his
hand
and
stood
ready
to
sacrifice
him
thereupon
the
boy
first
laughed
and
then
wept
while
he
was
doing
this
the
king
struck
him
a
blow
with
the
sword
so
that
his
head
was
severed
from
his
body
true
it
is
as
the
sages
have
said
woman
is
the
source
mine
of
misery
in
the
world
the
abode
of
imprudence
or
immorality
the
destroyer
of
courage
or
daring
and
the
occasioner
of
infatuation
and
the
bereaver
of
virtue
who
has
pronounced
such
a
source
root
of
venom
to
be
the
highest
good
again
it
is
said
store
up
wealth
against
adversity
and
disburse
wealth
to
guard
your
wife
and
give
up
wealth
and
wife
to
save
your
own
the
only
meanings
assigned
to
binti
in
the
vocabulary
are
submission
respects
solicitation
none
of
which
seem
to
apply
here
deriving
the
word
from
the
sanskrit
i
prefer
giving
it
the
signification
i
have
done
having
related
so
much
of
the
story
the
sprite
said
your
majesty
a
man
weeps
at
the
moment
of
dying
will
you
account
for
this
why
did
he
the
boy
laugh
the
monarch
replied
he
laughed
at
the
thought
of
this
that
in
infancy
a
mother
protects
her
child
and
on
his
growing
up
the
father
cherishes
him
and
in
both
good
and
bad
times
a
king
befriends
his
subjects
such
is
the
way
of
the
world
whereas
my
predicament
is
such
that
my
father
and
mother
have
delivered
me
over
to
the
king
through
greed
of
wealth
and
he
stands
sword
in
hand
ready
to
slay
me
and
the
demon
desires
a
sacrifice
no
single
one
of
them
feels
a
spark
of
on
hearing
this
the
sprite
went
and
hung
on
to
that
same
tree
and
the
king
also
speedily
arrived
there
and
binding
him
placed
him
on
his
shoulder
and
carried
him
off
tale
xx
the
sprite
said
o
king
there
is
a
city
named
bishalpur
the
king
of
which
was
named
bipuleshwar
in
his
city
lived
a
merchant
whose
name
was
arthdatt
and
his
daughter
s
name
was
he
had
married
her
to
a
merchant
of
kanwalpur
named
munni
some
days
after
the
merchant
crossed
the
ocean
on
a
mercantile
venture
and
when
she
attained
to
womanhood
here
at
home
she
was
standing
one
day
in
the
pavilion
and
observing
what
was
going
on
in
the
road
when
at
that
moment
a
brahman
s
son
named
kamalãkar
was
coming
along
the
eyes
of
the
pair
met
and
they
became
enamoured
of
each
other
at
first
sight
again
after
a
quarter
of
an
hour
or
so
recovering
the
brahman
s
son
in
the
restlessness
consequent
on
separation
from
his
beloved
proceeded
to
the
house
of
his
friend
and
here
she
too
was
in
extreme
distress
through
the
pain
of
separation
from
him
when
in
the
meantime
a
female
companion
came
and
took
her
up
she
had
however
no
remaining
then
she
the
companion
sprinkled
over
her
and
made
her
smell
perfumes
and
while
so
doing
her
senses
returned
and
she
said
o
cupid
mahãdeva
burnt
thee
to
ashes
and
yet
thou
wilt
not
desist
from
thy
knavish
tricks
but
comest
and
inflictest
pain
on
innocent
feeble
mahãdeva
or
hiva
was
once
engaged
in
religious
meditation
when
kamdeva
or
cupid
excited
amorous
desires
within
his
breast
whereupon
the
angry
god
reduced
him
to
ashes
by
a
fiery
glance
the
curious
reader
will
find
a
detailed
account
of
the
circumstance
in
the
chapter
of
the
prem
sagar
she
was
uttering
these
words
when
evening
came
on
and
the
moon
appeared
then
she
said
while
gazing
at
the
moonlight
o
moon
i
used
to
be
told
that
the
water
of
life
is
in
you
and
that
you
shed
it
in
your
beams
however
even
you
have
begun
to
pour
down
she
then
said
to
her
companion
take
me
up
and
lead
me
away
from
this
place
for
i
am
being
burnt
to
death
by
the
thereupon
she
raised
her
and
took
her
to
the
pavilion
and
said
dost
thou
feel
no
shame
at
uttering
such
words
then
she
said
o
friend
i
am
fully
aware
of
all
but
cupid
has
wounded
me
and
rendered
me
void
of
shame
and
i
make
great
efforts
to
be
patient
but
the
more
i
continue
to
be
consumed
with
the
fire
of
separation
the
more
does
home
appear
to
the
companion
said
keep
thy
mind
at
ease
i
will
relieve
thee
of
all
thy
having
said
thus
much
the
companion
went
home
and
she
the
determined
in
her
mind
that
she
would
quit
this
body
for
his
sake
and
being
born
again
enjoy
life
well
with
him
with
this
longing
in
her
mind
she
threw
a
noose
on
her
neck
and
was
about
drawing
it
tight
when
the
companion
arrived
and
instantly
taking
the
rope
off
her
neck
said
everything
can
be
attained
by
living
not
by
she
replied
better
is
it
to
die
than
suffer
such
the
companion
said
repose
awhile
and
i
will
go
and
bring
having
said
this
she
went
to
the
place
where
kamalãkar
was
and
taking
a
secret
look
at
him
perceived
that
he
also
was
much
disturbed
by
the
separation
from
his
beloved
while
his
friend
was
rubbing
down
sandal
in
rose
water
and
applying
it
to
his
body
and
fanning
him
with
tender
leaves
of
the
despite
which
he
was
crying
out
all
aflame
with
passion
and
saying
to
his
friend
bring
me
poison
i
will
sacrifice
my
life
and
be
released
from
this
suffering
observing
this
state
of
his
she
said
to
herself
however
courageous
learned
sagacious
discreet
and
patient
a
man
may
be
cupid
reduces
him
to
a
state
of
distraction
all
the
these
thoughts
having
passed
through
her
mind
the
companion
said
to
him
o
kamalãkar
anangmanjari
has
sent
word
to
thee
to
come
and
bestow
life
on
he
replied
she
indeed
has
given
life
to
after
saying
this
he
rose
up
and
the
companion
went
to
her
the
maiden
taking
him
along
with
her
when
he
got
there
lo
she
was
lying
dead
thereupon
he
also
uttered
a
cry
of
anguish
and
therewith
his
spirit
fled
and
when
it
became
morning
her
household
took
both
of
them
to
the
and
arranging
the
pile
placed
them
thereon
and
set
fire
to
it
when
in
the
meantime
her
husband
also
arrived
at
the
on
his
return
from
abroad
then
hearing
the
sound
of
the
people
s
weeping
he
went
there
and
what
does
he
behold
but
his
wife
burning
with
a
strange
man
he
also
being
distracted
with
love
burnt
himself
ta
death
in
the
same
fire
the
people
of
the
city
hearing
this
intelligence
began
saying
one
to
another
neither
has
eye
seen
nor
ear
heard
of
so
wonderful
an
event
after
relating
so
much
of
the
story
the
sprite
said
o
king
whose
love
of
these
three
was
greatest
the
king
said
her
husband
was
the
deepest
why
said
the
sprite
the
king
replied
he
who
on
seeing
his
wife
dead
for
another
s
sake
put
aside
anger
and
cheerfully
laid
down
his
life
through
love
for
her
he
is
the
deepest
hearing
these
words
the
sprite
went
again
and
hung
on
to
that
tree
the
king
too
went
there
bound
him
placed
him
on
his
shoulder
and
carried
him
off
tale
xxi
the
sprite
said
your
majesty
there
is
a
city
named
jaysthal
the
king
of
which
was
named
varddhamãn
in
his
city
was
a
brahman
named
vishnuswami
who
had
four
sons
one
a
gambler
the
second
a
lover
of
women
the
third
a
fornicator
the
fourth
an
atheist
the
brahman
was
one
day
admonishing
his
sons
saying
wealth
abides
not
in
the
house
of
him
who
the
gambler
became
greatly
annoyed
at
hearing
this
and
he
the
father
spoke
again
saying
it
is
said
in
the
rãjnit
or
book
of
policy
cut
off
the
nose
and
ears
of
a
gambler
and
expel
him
from
the
land
so
that
others
may
not
gamble
and
although
the
gambler
may
have
a
wife
and
family
in
his
house
do
not
consider
them
as
in
the
house
for
there
s
no
knowing
when
he
may
lose
them
at
play
again
those
who
are
attracted
by
the
wiles
of
courtesans
purchase
suffering
for
their
own
souls
while
they
part
with
their
all
under
the
influence
of
harlots
and
take
to
stealing
in
the
end
it
is
said
further
that
wise
men
keep
far
away
from
such
women
as
ensnare
their
hearts
in
a
moment
whereas
the
unwise
give
up
their
hearts
and
so
lose
all
their
honesty
good
disposition
reputation
conduct
judgment
piety
and
moral
character
moreover
the
exhortation
of
their
spiritual
preceptors
is
unpalatable
to
them
it
is
also
said
that
when
one
has
lost
his
own
sense
of
shame
why
should
he
fear
to
dishonour
any
one
else
and
there
is
a
proverb
to
the
effect
that
when
will
the
cat
that
devours
its
own
young
allow
a
rat
to
escape
he
went
on
to
say
those
who
do
not
acquire
knowledge
in
their
childhood
and
who
on
attaining
to
manhood
become
engrossed
in
amorous
pleasures
and
continue
to
pride
themselves
on
their
youth
those
persons
in
their
old
age
are
consumed
with
regretful
longings
for
that
which
they
have
neglected
in
their
youth
on
hearing
these
words
all
four
of
them
came
mutually
to
the
decision
that
it
was
better
for
an
ignorant
man
to
die
than
live
and
hence
it
was
best
for
them
to
visit
some
other
land
and
study
science
determining
on
this
they
went
to
another
city
and
after
some
time
having
studied
and
become
learned
they
set
out
for
their
home
what
do
they
see
on
the
road
but
a
kanjar
who
after
skinning
and
cutting
up
a
dead
tiger
and
making
a
bundle
of
its
bones
was
about
to
take
them
away
thereupon
they
said
to
one
another
come
let
each
of
us
put
his
knowledge
to
the
having
determined
on
this
one
of
them
called
him
the
kanjar
and
gave
him
something
and
taking
the
bundle
sent
him
away
and
quitting
the
road
they
opened
the
bundle
one
of
them
arranged
all
the
bones
in
their
proper
places
repeated
an
incantation
and
sprinkled
something
over
them
so
that
they
became
united
in
the
same
way
the
second
brought
the
flesh
together
on
the
bones
the
third
in
the
same
manner
fixed
the
skin
on
the
flesh
the
fourth
in
the
same
way
raised
it
to
life
thereupon
it
devoured
the
whole
four
of
them
as
soon
as
it
after
reaching
this
point
of
the
story
the
sprite
said
your
majesty
who
was
the
greatest
fool
of
those
four
king
vikram
replied
he
who
restored
it
to
life
was
the
greatest
fool
and
it
is
said
that
knowledge
without
wisdom
is
of
no
use
whatever
on
the
contrary
wisdom
is
superior
to
learning
and
those
who
lack
wisdom
die
just
as
he
who
raised
the
tiger
to
life
when
the
sprite
heard
these
words
he
went
and
suspended
himself
on
that
same
tree
again
did
the
king
bind
him
place
him
on
his
shoulder
and
carry
him
away
as
before
kanjar
is
the
name
of
a
low
caste
of
people
generally
employed
in
mean
offices
such
as
carrying
away
carcasses

are
of
his
caste
tale
xxii
the
sprite
said
your
majesty
there
is
a
city
named
biswapur
the
king
of
which
was
named
bidagdha
a
brahman
named
nãrãyan
dwelt
in
his
city
he
one
day
began
thinking
to
himself
my
body
has
become
old
and
i
am
acquainted
with
the
science
which
enables
one
to
enter
another
s
body
it
is
therefore
better
that
i
quit
this
old
body
and
enter
the
body
of
some
young
man
and
enjoy
when
he
had
determined
on
this
in
his
mind
he
set
about
entering
a
youthful
body
but
first
he
wept
and
then
he
laughed
and
after
that
he
entered
it
and
came
home
all
his
kinsfolk
however
were
aware
of
what
he
had
done
and
thereupon
he
said
to
them
i
have
now
become
an
having
said
this
he
began
to
recite
as
follows
he
who
dries
up
the
fountain
of
hope
with
the
fire
of
austere
devotion
and
placing
his
soul
therein
thus
deadens
his
senses
he
may
be
termed
a
wise
devotee
but
the
way
of
the
people
of
this
world
is
such
that
the
body
may
waste
away
the
head
shake
the
teeth
drop
out
and
they
walk
about
with
a
stick
in
their
old
age
yet
even
then
desire
is
not
quenched
and
thus
it
is
that
time
passes
away
day
comes
night
arrives
a
month
is
over
a
year
is
completed
one
is
a
child
then
an
old
man
while
nothing
is
known
as
to
who
one
himself
is
i
am
and
who
others
are
and
why
one
grieves
for
another
one
comes
another
goes
and
ultimately
all
life
must
depart
not
one
of
these
will
remain
many
and
various
bodies
are
there
and
many
and
various
minds
and
many
and
various
affections
and
various
kinds
of
delusions
has
brahma
created
but
the
wise
escape
these
and
quenching
hope
and
desire
shaving
their
heads
taking
a
staff
and
in
their
hands
subduing
the
passions
of
love
and
anger
become
ascetics
and
wander
barefooted
from
one
place
of
pilgrimage
to
another
these
same
find
eternal
salvation
this
world
moreover
is
as
a
dream
to
whom
can
you
impart
pleasure
in
it
to
whom
pain
it
is
even
like
the
new
leaf
shooting
from
the
centre
of
the
plaintain
tree
wherein
is
no
pith
whatever
and
those
who
pride
themselves
on
riches
youth
or
knowledge
are
unwise
again
they
who
turn
devotees
and
taking
a
in
hand
beg
alms
from
door
to
door
and
nourishing
their
bodies
with
milk
clarified
butter
and
sugar
become
lustful
and
have
sexual
intercourse
with
women
they
nullify
their
religious
after
repeating
so
much
he
proceeded
saying
i
will
now
go
on
a
on
hearing
these
words
his
relations
were
much
having
told
so
much
of
the
story
the
sprite
said
your
majesty
why
did
he
weep
and
why
did
he
laugh
then
the
king
said
calling
to
mind
his
mother
s
love
in
his
infancy
and
the
happiness
of
his
youth
and
from
a
feeling
of
affection
in
having
remained
so
many
days
in
that
body
he
wept
and
having
succeeded
in
his
art
and
entered
a
new
body
he
laughed
with
on
hearing
these
words
the
sprite
went
and
hung
on
to
the
same
tree
and
again
did
the
king
bind
him
as
before
place
him
on
his
shoulder
and
carry
him
away
tale
xxiii
this
sprite
said
your
majesty
there
was
a
city
named
dharmpur
where
a
king
named
dharmaj
ruled
in
his
city
was
a
brahman
named
govind
versed
in
the
whole
four
vedas
and
all
the
six
learned
treatises
and
a
careful
observer
of
all
his
religious
duties
and
haridatt
somdatt
yagyadatt
and
brahmadatt
were
his
four
sons
they
were
very
learned
very
clever
and
at
all
times
obedient
to
their
father
after
some
time
his
eldest
son
died
and
he
too
was
at
the
point
of
death
through
grief
for
at
that
time
vishnusharma
the
king
s
family
priest
came
and
began
reasoning
with
him
saying
when
this
being
man
enters
the
mother
s
womb
he
first
suffers
pain
there
secondly
falling
under
the
influence
of
love
in
youth
he
endures
the
anguish
of
separation
from
his
beloved
thirdly
becoming
old
he
is
involved
in
suffering
through
his
body
being
feeble
in
brief
many
are
the
sorrows
attendant
on
man
s
being
born
in
the
world
and
few
are
the
joys
for
the
world
is
the
source
of
sorrow
if
a
man
were
to
climb
to
the
top
of
a
tree
or
go
and
sit
on
the
summit
of
a
mountain
or
remain
hiding
in
water
or
sneak
into
an
iron
cage
and
remain
therein
or
go
and
conceal
himself
in
the
infernal
regions
even
then
death
would
not
let
him
escape
moreover
whatever
one
may
be
whether
learned
or
a
fool
rich
or
poor
wise
or
unwise
strong
or
weak
still
this
all
devouring
death
lets
no
one
escape
the
full
duration
of
a
man
s
life
is
a
hundred
years
of
this
half
passes
away
in
night
and
half
of
the
half
in
childhood
and
old
age
the
remainder
is
spent
in
contention
the
distress
arising
from
separation
from
those
we
love
and
affliction
further
the
soul
that
is
is
as
restless
as
a
watery
wave
how
then
can
it
yield
man
any
peace
and
now
in
this
iron
age
to
meet
with
truthful
men
is
a
difficult
matter
while
countries
are
daily
laid
waste
kings
are
avaricious
the
earth
yields
little
fruit
thieves
and
evil
doers
commit
violence
on
the
earth
and
but
little
of
religion
devotion
and
truth
remain
in
the
world
kings
are
tyrannical
brahmans
covetous
men
have
fallen
under
the
influence
of
women
wives
have
become
wanton
sons
have
begun
reviling
their
fathers
and
friends
have
begun
to
display
enmity
observe
further
that
death
did
not
even
spare
the
great
chimanyu
whose
maternal
uncle
was
kanhaiya
and
father
arjun
and
when
yama
carries
off
a
man
wealth
remains
behind
in
his
house
and
father
mother
wife
son
brothers
and
kindred
no
one
proves
of
any
avail
his
good
and
evil
deeds
his
vices
and
his
virtues
alone
accompany
him
while
those
same
kinsfolk
take
him
to
the
and
burn
him
and
see
how
the
night
comes
to
an
end
on
one
side
while
day
dawns
on
the
other
here
the
moon
sets
there
the
sun
rises
in
the
same
way
youth
departs
old
age
comes
on
thus
also
time
goes
on
passing
away
and
yet
even
while
perceiving
this
man
does
not
learn
wisdom
observe
again
in
the
first
or
golden
age
mandhãta
a
great
king
who
filled
covered
the
whole
earth
with
the
fame
of
his
virtue
and
in
the
second
or
silver
age
the
glorious
monarch
rãmchandra
who
bridging
the
sea
destroyed
such
a
fortress
as
lanka
and
slew
rãvan
and
in
the
third
age
yudhisthir
reigned
in
such
a
manner
that
people
sing
of
his
renown
to
this
day
yet
death
did
not
spare
even
these
moreover
the
birds
which
fly
in
the
air
and
the
animals
which
dwell
in
the
sea
when
the
hour
arrives
even
these
fall
into
trouble
no
one
has
escaped
sorrow
on
coming
into
this
world
to
grieve
on
this
account
is
folly
it
is
best
therefore
to
practise
religious
yama
is
the
judge
of
the
deceased
and
ruler
of
the
infernal
regions
also
the
god
of
death
when
vishnusharmã
had
reasoned
with
him
in
this
manner
it
came
into
the
brahman
s
mind
that
he
would
thenceforth
perform
meritorious
and
pious
acts
having
thought
this
over
in
his
mind
he
said
to
his
sons
i
am
about
to
sit
down
to
a
sacrifice
you
go
and
bring
me
a
turtle
from
the
on
receiving
their
father
s
command
they
went
to
a
fisherman
and
said
take
a
rupee
and
catch
a
turtle
for
he
took
it
and
caught
one
and
gave
it
to
them
then
the
eldest
of
the
brothers
said
to
the
second
do
thou
take
it
he
said
to
the
youngest
brother
do
thou
take
it
he
replied
saying
i
will
not
touch
it
a
bad
smell
will
cling
to
my
hands
and
i
am
very
nice
in
my
the
second
said
i
am
very
particular
in
my
intercourse
with
the
eldest
said
i
am
particular
in
the
matter
of
sleeping
on
a
i
hazard
this
meaning
for
chatur
in
the
teeth
of
the
vocabulary
and
the
dictionaries
as
the
meanings
contained
therein
do
not
seem
to
me
to
apply
the
student
however
may
if
he
pleases
substitute
sharp
or
clever
for
thus
did
the
three
of
them
begin
wrangling
and
leaving
the
turtle
where
it
was
they
proceeded
quarrelling
the
while
to
the
king
s
gate
and
said
to
the
gatekeeper
three
brahmans
have
come
seeking
justice
go
thou
and
tell
this
to
the
on
hearing
this
the
doorkeeper
went
and
informed
the
king
the
king
summoned
them
and
asked
why
are
you
quarrelling
one
with
another
then
the
youngest
of
them
said
your
majesty
i
am
very
particular
as
to
the
second
said
lord
of
the
earth
i
am
very
particular
as
to
the
eldest
said
incarnation
of
justice
i
am
particular
in
the
matter
of
when
the
monarch
heard
this
he
said
each
of
you
submit
to
a
they
said
very
the
king
sent
for
his
cook
and
said
prepare
various
kinds
of
condiments
and
meats
and
give
this
brahman
a
thoroughly
good
on
hearing
this
the
cook
went
and
prepared
food
and
taking
with
him
the
one
who
was
nice
in
the
matter
of
food
seated
him
in
front
of
the
dishes
he
was
on
the
point
of
taking
up
a
mouthful
and
putting
it
into
his
mouth
when
an
offensive
smell
came
from
it
he
let
it
go
washed
his
hands
and
came
to
the
king
the
king
asked
didst
thou
enjoy
thy
repast
then
he
said
your
majesty
i
perceived
a
disagreeable
smell
in
the
food
and
did
not
the
king
said
again
state
the
cause
of
the
offensive
he
replied
your
majesty
it
was
rice
which
had
been
grown
on
a
the
smell
of
corpses
proceeded
from
it
and
hence
i
did
not
eat
on
hearing
this
the
king
summoned
his
steward
and
asked
sirrah
from
what
village
does
this
rice
come
he
replied
from
shibpur
your
majesty
the
king
said
summon
the
landholder
of
that
thereupon
the
steward
had
the
landholder
brought
before
the
monarch
the
king
asked
him
on
what
land
was
this
rice
grown
he
replied
on
a
your
majesty
when
the
king
heard
this
he
said
to
that
brahman
thou
art
indeed
a
connoisseur
in
the
matter
of
after
this
he
had
the
one
who
was
nice
in
the
matter
of
women
sent
for
and
having
a
bed
laid
out
in
an
apartment
and
all
the
requisites
for
enjoyment
placed
therein
had
a
beautiful
woman
brought
and
placed
near
him
and
the
two
while
lying
down
began
conversing
with
each
other
the
king
was
secretly
looking
on
through
a
lattice
now
the
brahman
was
about
to
give
her
a
kiss
when
smelling
her
breath
he
turned
away
his
face
and
went
to
sleep
the
king
having
witnessed
this
conduct
entered
his
palace
and
sought
repose
rising
early
in
the
morning
he
came
into
the
court
and
summoned
that
brahman
and
asked
o
brahman
didst
thou
pass
the
night
pleasantly
he
replied
your
majesty
i
found
no
why
asked
the
king
again
the
brahman
replied
the
smell
of
a
goat
proceeded
from
her
mouth
and
my
mind
was
much
distressed
in
when
the
king
heard
this
he
summoned
the
procuress
and
inquired
whence
didst
thou
bring
this
woman
and
who
is
she
she
said
she
is
my
sister
s
daughter
her
mother

when
she
was
three
months
old
and
i
brought
her
up
on

on
hearing
this
the
monarch
said
thou
art
indeed
a
connoisseur
in
respect
of
after
that
he
had
a
very
fine
bed
prepared
and
caused
the
brahman
who
was
a
nice
judge
of
beds
to
sleep
thereon
on
its
becoming
morning
the
king
sent
for
him
and
asked
didst
thou
sleep
comfortably
through
the
night
he
replied
your
majesty
i
had
no
sleep
the
whole
night
why
asked
the
king
he
replied
your
majesty
in
the
seventh
fold
of
the
bedding
there
was
a
hair
which
was
pricking
my
back
and
i
had
no
sleep
in
on
hearing
this
the
king
looked
into
the
seventh
fold
of
the
bedding
and
lo
a
hair
was
found
thereupon
he
said
to
him
thou
art
indeed
a
nice
judge
of

relating
so
much
of
the
story
the

asked
who

the
greatest
connoisseur
of
those
three

bir
yikramajit
replied
he
who
was
the
connoisseur
in
the
matter
of

the
sprite
heard
this
he
went
again
and
hung
on
to
that
tree
and
the
king
also
went
there
on
the
instant
and
bound
him

him
on
his
shoulder

tale
xxiv
the
sprite
said
your
majesty
in
the
country
of
kaling
there
was
a
brahman
named
yagya
sharmã
whose
wife
s
name
was
somadattã
she
was
very
beautiful
the
brahman
began
offering
sacrifices
whereupon
his
wife
had
a
beautiful
boy
when
he
attained
the
age
of
five
years
his
father
began
teaching
him
the
at
the
age
of
twelve
years
he
had
finished
the
study
of
all
the
shãstras
and
become
a
great
scholar
and
he
began
to
be
in
constant
attendance
upon
and
to
help
his
after
the
lapse
of
some
time
the
boy
died
and
in
their
sorrow
for
him
his
parents
uttered
loud
cries
of
lamentation
and
wailing
on
receiving
this
news
all
his
kinsfolk
hastened
thither
and
fastening
the
boy
upon
a
bier
took
him
away
to
the
and
when
there

repeatedly
gazing
at
him
and
saying
to
one
another

even
in
death
he
appears
beautiful

were
uttering
words
like
these
and
arranging
the
pyre
while
an
ascetic
was
also
seated
there
engaged
in
religious
austerity
he
hearing
these
words
began
to
think
to
himself

body
has
become
very
old
if
i

this
boy
s
body

can
practise
religious
meditation
with
ease

thus
he
entered
the
body
of
the
child
turned
round
and
pronouncing
the
names
of
rãm
balarãm
and
krishn
sat
up
as
one
sits
up
from
sleep
when
the
people
witnessed
this
they
all
returned
to
their
homes
in
astonishment
while
his
father
lost
all
desire
for
the
world
on
witnessing
this
marvel
first
he
laughed
then
he
after
relating
so
much
of
the
story
the
sprite
said
say
your
majesty
why
he
laughed
and
why
he
thereupon
the
king
said
seeing
the
ascetic
enter
his
body
and
so
learning
the
art
of
changing
one
s
own
body
for
another
he
laughed
and
through
regret
at
having
to
quit
his
own
body
he
wept
thinking
thus
shall
i
too
some
day
have
to
abandon
my
own
hearing
this
the
sprite
went
again
and
suspended
himself
on
that
tree
and
the
king
too
arriving
close
at
his
heels
bound
him
put
him
on
his
shoulder
and
carried

army
went
over
in
part
to
the
enemy
and
a
portion
was
cut
to
pieces
then
having
no
help
for
it
he
took
his
wife
and
daughter
with
him
and
went
forth
by
night
into
the
jungle
after
he
had
penetrated
several
miles
kos
into

went
himself
towards
the
village
to
get
something
to

in
the
meantime
a
body
of
bhils
came
and
surrounded
him
and
told
him
to
throw

commenced
discharging

with
such
force
that

reeled
and
fell
and
one
of
them
came
up
and
out
off
the
king

head
when
the
queen
and
princess
saw
the
king
dead
they
took
their
way
back
to
the
jungle
weeping
and
beating
their
breasts
after
having
proceeded
a
or

thus
they
got
tired
and
sat
down
