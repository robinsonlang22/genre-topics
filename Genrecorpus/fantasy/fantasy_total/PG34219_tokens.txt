it
the
entrance
to
the

this
is
an
enchanted
garden
the
red
clue
ran
straight
across
the
grass
the
three
stood
breathless
awaiting
the
result
it
a
game
is
it
asked
jimmy
she
was
waiting
for
them
with
a
candle
in
her
hand
looking
at
herself
in
the
little
mirror
backward
and
forward
he
went
your

that
the

asked
quickly
i

this
minute
the
moving
stone
beast
the
men
were
taking
silver
out
of
two
great
chests
johnson
washing
in
his
own
backyard
gerald
halted
at
the
end
of
a
little
he
staggered
back
against
the
lep
into
the
water
it
was
eliza
dishevelled
breathless
she
kissed
him
with
little
quick
french
pecks
down
came
the
loveliest
hair
fully
half
a
dozen
of
the
chairs
were
occupied
a
limp
hand
was
laid
on
his
arm
wonder
what
lies
he
telling
them
it
was
a
strange
procession
a
painted
pointed
paper
face
peered
out
jimmy
shook
them
to
pieces
two
hats
were
raised
kathleen
hands
up
the
clothes
and
the
sticks
he
cried
out
aloud
in
that
crowded
place
she
sat
down
suddenly
on
the
floor
kathleen
had
her
wish
she
was
a
statue
mabel
lay
down
was
covered
up
and
left
the
monster
lizard
slipped
heavily
into
the
water
what
is
it
she
asked
beginning
to
tremble
side
by
side
the
three
swam
it
was
a
celestial
picnic
the
joys
of
dipping
one
feet
in
cool
running
water
they
stood
still
and
looked
at
each
other
he
became
eager
alert
very
keen
the
american
fired
again
the
enchanted
castle
chapter
i
there
were
three
of
them
jerry
jimmy
and
kathleen
of
course
name
was
gerald
and
not
jeremiah
whatever
you
may
think
and
name
was
james
and
kathleen
was
never
called
by
her
name
at
all
but
cathy
or
catty
or
puss
cat
when
her
brothers
were
pleased
with
her
and
scratch
cat
when
they
were
not
pleased
and
they
were
at
school
in
a
little
town
in
the
west
of
england
the
boys
at
one
school
of
course
and
the
girl
at
another
because
the
sensible
habit
of
having
boys
and
girls
at
the
same
school
is
not
yet
as
common
as
i
hope
it
will
be
some
day
they
used
to
see
each
other
on
saturdays
and
sundays
at
the
house
of
a
kind
maiden
lady
but
it
was
one
of
those
houses
where
it
is
impossible
to
play
you
know
the
kind
of
house
do
you
there
is
a
sort
of
a
something
about
that
kind
of
house
that
makes
you
hardly
able
even
to
talk
to
each
other
when
you
are
left
alone
and
playing
seems
unnatural
and
affected
so
they
looked
forward
to
the
holidays
when
they
should
all
go
home
and
be
together
all
day
long
in
a
house
where
playing
was
natural
and
conversation
possible
and
where
the
hampshire
forests
and
fields
were
full
of
interesting
things
to
do
and
see
their
cousin
betty
was
to
be
there
too
and
there
were
plans
betty
school
broke
up
before
theirs
and
so
she
got
to
the
hampshire
home
first
and
the
moment
she
got
there
she
began
to
have
measles
so
that
my
three
could
go
home
at
all
you
may
imagine
their
feelings
the
thought
of
seven
weeks
at
miss
hervey
was
not
to
be
borne
and
all
three
wrote
home
and
said
so
this
astonished
their
parents
very
much
because
they
had
always
thought
it
was
so
nice
for
the
children
to
have
dear
miss
hervey
to
go
to
however
they
were
jolly
decent
about
it
as
jerry
said
and
after
a
lot
of
letters
and
telegrams
it
was
arranged
that
the
boys
should
go
and
stay
at
kathleen
school
where
there
were
now
no
girls
left
and
no
mistresses
except
the
french
one
it
be
better
than
being
at
miss
hervey
said
kathleen
when
the
boys
came
round
to
ask
mademoiselle
when
it
would
be
convenient
for
them
to
come
and
besides
our
school
not
half
so
ugly
as
yours
we
do
have
tablecloths
on
the
tables
and
curtains
at
the
windows
and
yours
is
all
deal
boards
and
desks
and
inkiness
when
they
had
gone
to
pack
their
boxes
kathleen
made
all
the
rooms
as
pretty
as
she
could
with
flowers
in
jam
jars
marigolds
chiefly
because
there
was
nothing
much
else
in
the
back
garden
there
were
geraniums
in
the
front
garden
and
calceolarias
and
lobelias
of
course
the
children
were
not
allowed
to
pick
these
we
ought
to
have
some
sort
of
play
to
keep
us
going
through
the
holidays
said
kathleen
when
tea
was
over
and
she
had
unpacked
and
arranged
the
boys
clothes
in
the
painted
chests
of
drawers
feeling
very
and
careful
as
she
neatly
laid
the
different
sorts
of
clothes
in
tidy
little
heaps
in
the
drawers
suppose
we
write
a
book
you
could
said
jimmy
i
did
mean
me
of
course
said
kathleen
a
little
injured
i
meant
us
too
much
fag
said
gerald
briefly
if
we
wrote
a
book
kathleen
persisted
about
what
the
insides
of
schools
really
like
people
would
read
it
and
say
how
clever
we
were
more
likely
expel
us
said
gerald
no
we
have
an
game
bandits
or
something
like
that
it
would
be
bad
if
we
could
get
a
cave
and
keep
stores
in
it
and
have
our
meals
there
there
are
any
caves
said
jimmy
who
was
fond
of
contradicting
every
one
and
besides
your
precious
mamselle
wo
let
us
go
out
alone
as
likely
as
not
oh
we
see
about
that
said
gerald
i
go
and
talk
to
her
like
a
father
like
that
kathleen
pointed
the
thumb
of
scorn
at
him
and
he
looked
in
the
glass
to
brush
his
hair
and
his
clothes
and
to
wash
his
face
and
hands
was
to
our
hero
but
the
work
of
a
moment
said
gerald
and
went
to
suit
the
action
to
the
word
it
was
a
very
sleek
boy
brown
and
thin
and
that
knocked
at
the
door
of
the
parlour
where
mademoiselle
sat
reading
a
book
and
wishing
vain
wishes
gerald
could
always
make
himself
look
interesting
at
a
moment
notice
a
very
useful
accomplishment
in
dealing
with
strange
it
was
done
by
opening
his
grey
eyes
rather
wide
allowing
the
corners
of
his
mouth
to
droop
and
assuming
a
gentle
pleading
expression
resembling
that
of
the
late
little
lord
fauntleroy
who
must
by
the
way
be
quite
old
now
and
an
awful
prig
entrez
said
mademoiselle
in
shrill
french
accents
so
he
entered
eh
bien
she
said
rather
impatiently
i
hope
i
am
not
disturbing
you
said
gerald
in
whose
mouth
it
seemed
butter
would
not
have
melted
but
no
she
said
somewhat
softened
what
is
it
that
you
desire
i
thought
i
ought
to
come
and
say
how
do
you
do
said
gerald
because
of
you
being
the
lady
of
the
house
he
held
out
the
hand
still
damp
and
red
she
took
it
you
are
a
very
polite
little
boy
she
said
not
at
all
said
gerald
more
polite
than
ever
i
am
so
sorry
for
you
it
must
be
dreadful
to
have
us
to
look
after
in
the
holidays
but
not
at
all
said
mademoiselle
in
her
turn
i
am
sure
you
will
be
very
good
childrens
gerald
look
assured
her
that
he
and
the
others
would
be
as
near
angels
as
children
could
be
without
ceasing
to
be
human
we
try
he
said
earnestly
can
one
do
anything
for
you
asked
the
french
governess
kindly
oh
no
thank
you
said
gerald
we
do
want
to
give
you
any
trouble
at
all
and
i
was
thinking
it
would
be
less
trouble
for
you
if
we
were
to
go
out
into
the
woods
all
day
and
take
our
dinner
with
us
something
cold
you
know
so
as
not
to
be
a
trouble
to
the
cook
you
are
very
considerate
said
mademoiselle
coldly
then
gerald
eyes
smiled
they
had
a
trick
of
doing
this
when
his
lips
were
quite
serious
mademoiselle
caught
the
twinkle
and
she
laughed
and
gerald
laughed
too
little
deceiver
she
said
why
not
say
at
once
you
want
to
be
free
of
how
you
say
overwatching
without
pretending
it
is
me
you
wish
to
please
you
have
to
be
careful
with
said
gerald
but
it
is
all
pretence
either
we
want
to
trouble
you
and
we
do
want
you
to
illustration
little
deceiver
she
said
to
trouble
you
eh
bien
your
parents
they
permit
these
days
at
woods
oh
yes
said
gerald
truthfully
then
i
will
not
be
more
a
dragon
than
the
parents
i
will
forewarn
the
cook
are
you
content
rather
said
gerald
mademoiselle
you
are
a
dear
a
deer
she
repeated
a
stag
no
a
a
said
gerald
a
regular
and
you
repent
it
is
there
anything
we
can
do
for
you
wind
your
wool
or
find
your
spectacles
or
he
thinks
me
a
grandmother
said
mademoiselle
laughing
more
than
ever
go
then
and
be
not
more
naughty
than
you
must
well
what
luck
the
others
asked
it
all
right
said
gerald
indifferently
i
told
you
it
would
be
the
ingenuous
youth
won
the
regard
of
the
foreign
governess
who
in
her
youth
had
been
the
beauty
of
her
humble
village
i
do
believe
she
ever
was
she
too
stern
said
kathleen
ah
said
gerald
that
only
because
you
do
know
how
to
manage
her
she
was
stern
with
i
say
what
a
humbug
you
are
though
are
you
said
jimmy
no
i
a
dip
something
like
an
ambassador
dipsoplomatist
that
what
i
am
anyhow
we
got
our
day
and
if
we
do
find
a
cave
in
it
my
name
not
jack
robinson
mademoiselle
less
stern
than
kathleen
had
ever
seen
her
presided
at
supper
which
was
bread
and
treacle
spread
several
hours
before
and
now
harder
and
drier
than
any
other
food
you
can
think
of
gerald
was
very
polite
in
handing
her
butter
and
cheese
and
pressing
her
to
taste
the
bread
and
treacle
bah
it
is
like
sand
in
the
mouth
of
a
dryness
is
it
possible
this
pleases
you
no
said
gerald
it
is
not
possible
but
it
is
not
polite
for
boys
to
make
remarks
about
their
food
she
laughed
but
there
was
no
more
dried
bread
and
treacle
for
supper
after
that
how
you
do
it
kathleen
whispered
admiringly
as
they
said
oh
it
quite
easy
when
you
once
got
a
to
see
what
after
you
see
i
shall
drive
her
with
a
rein
of
darning
cotton
after
this
next
morning
gerald
got
up
early
and
gathered
a
little
bunch
of
pink
carnations
from
a
plant
which
he
found
hidden
among
the
marigolds
he
tied
it
up
with
black
cotton
and
laid
it
on
mademoiselle
plate
she
smiled
and
looked
quite
handsome
as
she
stuck
the
flowers
in
her
belt
do
you
think
it
quite
decent
jimmy
asked
later
sort
of
bribing
people
to
let
you
do
as
you
like
with
flowers
and
things
and
passing
them
the
salt
it
not
that
said
kathleen
suddenly
know
what
gerald
means
only
i
never
think
of
the
things
in
time
myself
you
see
if
you
want
to
be
nice
to
you
the
least
you
can
do
is
to
be
nice
to
them
and
think
of
little
things
to
please
them
i
never
think
of
any
myself
jerry
does
that
why
all
the
old
ladies
like
him
it
not
bribery
it
a
sort
of
honesty
like
paying
for
things
well
anyway
said
jimmy
putting
away
the
moral
question
we
got
a
ripping
day
for
the
woods
they
had
the
wide
high
street
even
at
the
busy
morning
hour
almost
as
quiet
as
a
lay
bathed
in
sunshine
the
leaves
shone
fresh
from
last
night
rain
but
the
road
was
dry
and
in
the
sunshine
the
very
dust
of
it
sparkled
like
diamonds
the
beautiful
old
houses
standing
stout
and
strong
looked
as
though
they
were
basking
in
the
sunshine
and
enjoying
it
but
there
any
woods
asked
kathleen
as
they
passed
the
it
does
much
matter
about
woods
said
gerald
dreamily
we
sure
to
find
one
of
the
chaps
told
me
his
father
said
when
he
was
a
boy
there
used
to
be
a
little
cave
under
the
bank
in
a
lane
near
the
salisbury
road
but
he
said
there
was
an
enchanted
castle
there
too
so
perhaps
the
cave
is
true
either
if
we
were
to
get
horns
said
kathleen
and
to
blow
them
very
hard
all
the
way
we
might
find
a
magic
castle
if
you
got
the
money
to
throw
away
on
horns
said
jimmy
contemptuously
well
i
have
as
it
happens
so
there
said
kathleen
and
the
horns
were
bought
in
a
tiny
shop
with
a
bulging
window
full
of
a
tangle
of
toys
and
sweets
and
cucumbers
and
sour
apples
and
the
quiet
square
at
the
end
of
the
town
where
the
church
is
and
the
houses
of
the
most
respectable
people
echoed
to
the
sound
of
horns
blown
long
and
loud
but
none
of
the
houses
turned
into
enchanted
castles
so
they
went
along
the
salisbury
road
which
was
very
hot
and
dusty
so
they
agreed
to
drink
one
of
the
bottles
of
gingerbeer
we
might
as
well
carry
the
gingerbeer
inside
us
as
inside
the
bottle
said
jimmy
and
we
can
hide
the
bottle
and
call
for
it
as
we
come
back
presently
they
came
to
a
place
where
the
road
as
gerald
said
went
two
ways
at
once
looks
like
adventures
said
kathleen
and
they
took
the
road
and
the
next
time
they
took
a
turning
it
was
a
one
so
as
to
be
quite
fair
jimmy
said
and
then
a
one
and
then
a
left
and
so
on
till
they
were
completely
lost
said
kathleen
how
jolly
and
now
trees
arched
overhead
and
the
banks
of
the
road
were
high
and
bushy
the
adventurers
had
long
since
ceased
to
blow
their
horns
it
was
too
tiring
to
go
on
doing
that
when
there
was
no
one
to
be
annoyed
by
it
oh
kriky
observed
jimmy
suddenly
let
sit
down
a
bit
and
have
some
of
our
dinner
we
might
call
it
lunch
you
know
he
added
persuasively
so
they
sat
down
in
the
hedge
and
ate
the
ripe
red
gooseberries
that
were
to
have
been
their
dessert
and
as
they
sat
and
rested
and
wished
that
their
boots
did
not
feel
so
full
of
feet
gerald
leaned
back
against
the
bushes
and
the
bushes
gave
way
so
that
he
almost
fell
over
backward
something
had
yielded
to
the
pressure
of
his
back
and
there
was
the
sound
of
something
heavy
that
fell
o
jimminy
he
remarked
recovering
himself
suddenly
something
hollow
in
there
the
stone
i
was
leaning
against
simply
i
wish
it
was
a
cave
said
jimmy
but
of
course
it
is
if
we
blow
the
horns
perhaps
it
will
be
said
kathleen
and
hastily
blew
her
own
gerald
reached
his
hand
through
the
bushes
i
ca
feel
anything
but
air
he
said
it
just
a
hole
full
of
emptiness
the
other
two
pulled
back
the
bushes
there
certainly
was
a
hole
in
the
bank
going
to
go
in
observed
gerald
oh
do
said
his
sister
i
wish
you
would
suppose
there
were
snakes
not
likely
said
gerald
but
he
leaned
forward
and
struck
a
match
it
a
cave
he
cried
and
put
his
knee
on
the
mossy
stone
he
had
been
sitting
on
scrambled
over
it
and
disappeared
a
breathless
pause
followed
you
all
right
asked
jimmy
yes
come
on
you
better
come
feet
first
there
a
bit
of
a
drop
i
go
next
said
kathleen
and
went
feet
first
as
advised
the
feet
waved
wildly
in
the
air
look
out
said
gerald
in
the
dark
you
have
my
eye
out
put
your
feet
girl
not
up
it
no
use
trying
to
fly
here
there
no
room
he
helped
her
by
pulling
her
feet
forcibly
down
and
then
lifting
her
under
the
arms
she
felt
rustling
dry
leaves
under
her
boots
and
stood
ready
to
receive
jimmy
who
came
in
head
first
like
one
diving
into
an
unknown
sea
it
a
cave
said
kathleen
the
young
explorers
explained
gerald
blocking
up
the
hole
of
entrance
with
his
shoulders
dazzled
at
first
by
the
darkness
of
the
cave
could
see
nothing
darkness
does
dazzle
said
jimmy
i
wish
we
got
a
candle
said
kathleen
yes
it
does
gerald
contradicted
could
see
nothing
but
their
dauntless
leader
whose
eyes
had
grown
used
to
the
dark
while
the
clumsy
forms
of
the
others
were
bunging
up
the
entrance
had
made
a
discovery
illustration
jimmy
came
in
head
first
like
one
diving
into
an
unknown
sea
oh
what
both
the
others
were
used
to
gerald
way
of
telling
a
story
while
he
acted
it
but
they
did
sometimes
wish
that
he
did
talk
quite
so
long
and
so
like
a
book
in
moments
of
excitement
he
did
not
reveal
the
dread
secret
to
his
faithful
followers
till
one
and
all
had
given
him
their
word
of
honour
to
be
calm
we
be
calm
all
right
said
jimmy
impatiently
well
then
said
gerald
ceasing
suddenly
to
be
a
book
and
becoming
a
boy
there
a
light
over
there
look
behind
you
they
looked
and
there
was
a
faint
greyness
on
the
brown
walls
of
the
cave
and
a
brighter
greyness
cut
off
sharply
by
a
dark
line
showed
that
round
a
turning
or
angle
of
the
cave
there
was
daylight
attention
said
gerald
at
least
that
was
what
he
meant
though
what
he
said
was
as
becomes
the
son
of
a
soldier
the
others
mechanically
obeyed
you
will
remain
at
attention
till
i
give
the
word
march
on
which
you
will
advance
cautiously
in
open
order
following
your
hero
leader
taking
care
not
to
tread
on
the
dead
and
wounded
i
wish
you
would
said
kathleen
there
are
any
said
jimmy
feeling
for
her
hand
in
the
dark
he
only
means
take
care
not
to
tumble
over
stones
and
things
here
he
found
her
hand
and
she
screamed
it
only
me
said
jimmy
i
thought
you
like
me
to
hold
it
but
you
just
like
a
girl
their
eyes
had
now
begun
to
get
accustomed
to
the
darkness
and
all
could
see
that
they
were
in
a
rough
stone
cave
that
went
straight
on
for
about
three
or
four
yards
and
then
turned
sharply
to
the
right
death
or
victory
remarked
gerald
now
then
slow
march
he
advanced
carefully
picking
his
way
among
the
loose
earth
and
stones
that
were
the
floor
of
the
cave
a
sail
a
sail
he
cried
as
he
turned
the
corner
how
splendid
kathleen
drew
a
long
breath
as
she
came
out
into
the
sunshine
i
do
see
any
sail
said
jimmy
following
the
narrow
passage
ended
in
a
round
arch
all
fringed
with
ferns
and
creepers
they
passed
through
the
arch
into
a
deep
narrow
gully
whose
banks
were
of
stones
and
in
the
crannies
grew
more
ferns
and
long
grasses
trees
growing
on
the
top
of
the
bank
arched
across
and
the
sunlight
came
through
in
changing
patches
of
brightness
turning
the
gully
to
a
roofed
corridor
of
the
path
which
was
of
flagstones
where
heaps
of
leaves
had
drifted
sloped
steeply
down
and
at
the
end
of
it
was
another
round
arch
quite
dark
inside
above
which
rose
rocks
and
grass
and
bushes
it
like
the
outside
of
a
railway
tunnel
said
james
it
the
entrance
to
the
enchanted
castle
said
kathleen
let
blow
the
horns
dry
up
said
gerald
the
bold
captain
reproving
the
silly
chatter
of
his
subordinates
i
like
that
said
jimmy
indignant
i
thought
you
would
resumed
gerald
of
his
subordinates
bade
them
advance
with
caution
and
in
silence
because
after
all
there
might
be
somebody
about
and
the
other
arch
might
be
an
or
something
dangerous
what
asked
kathleen
anxiously
bears
perhaps
said
gerald
briefly
there
are
any
bears
without
bars
in
england
anyway
said
jimmy
they
call
bears
bars
in
america
he
added
absently
quick
march
was
gerald
only
reply
and
they
marched
under
the
drifted
damp
leaves
the
path
was
firm
and
stony
to
their
shuffling
feet
at
the
dark
arch
they
stopped
there
are
steps
down
said
jimmy
it
an
said
gerald
do
let
said
kathleen
our
hero
said
gerald
who
nothing
could
dismay
raised
the
faltering
hopes
of
his
abject
minions
by
saying
that
he
was
jolly
well
going
on
and
they
could
do
as
they
liked
about
it
if
you
call
names
said
jimmy
you
can
go
on
by
yourself
he
added
so
there
illustration
it
the
entrance
to
the
enchanted
castle
said
kathleen
it
part
of
the
game
silly
explained
gerald
kindly
you
can
be
captain
so
you
better
hold
your
jaw
now
and
begin
to
think
about
what
names
you
call
us
when
it
your
turn
very
slowly
and
carefully
they
went
down
the
steps
a
vaulted
stone
arched
over
their
heads
gerald
struck
a
match
when
the
last
step
was
found
to
have
no
edge
and
to
be
in
fact
the
beginning
of
a
passage
turning
to
the
left
this
said
jimmy
will
take
us
back
into
the
road
or
under
it
said
gerald
we
come
down
eleven
steps
they
went
on
following
their
leader
who
went
very
slowly
for
fear
as
he
explained
of
steps
the
passage
was
very
dark
i
do
half
like
it
whispered
jimmy
then
came
a
glimmer
of
daylight
that
grew
and
grew
and
presently
ended
in
another
arch
that
looked
out
over
a
scene
so
like
a
picture
out
of
a
book
about
italy
that
every
one
breath
was
taken
away
and
they
simply
walked
forward
silent
and
staring
a
short
avenue
of
cypresses
led
widening
as
it
went
to
a
marble
terrace
that
lay
broad
and
white
in
the
sunlight
the
children
blinking
leaned
their
arms
on
the
broad
flat
balustrade
and
gazed
immediately
below
them
was
a
lake
just
like
a
lake
in
the
beauties
of
italy
a
lake
with
swans
and
an
island
and
weeping
willows
beyond
it
were
green
slopes
dotted
with
groves
of
trees
and
amid
the
trees
gleamed
the
white
limbs
of
statues
against
a
little
hill
to
the
left
was
a
round
white
building
with
pillars
and
to
the
right
a
waterfall
came
tumbling
down
among
mossy
stones
to
splash
into
the
lake
steps
led
from
the
terrace
to
the
water
and
other
steps
to
the
green
lawns
beside
it
away
across
the
grassy
slopes
deer
were
feeding
and
in
the
distance
where
the
groves
of
trees
thickened
into
what
looked
almost
a
forest
were
enormous
shapes
of
grey
stone
like
nothing
that
the
children
had
ever
seen
before
that
chap
at
school
said
gerald
it
an
enchanted
castle
said
kathleen
i
do
see
any
castle
said
jimmy
what
do
you
call
that
then
gerald
pointed
to
where
beyond
a
belt
of
white
towers
and
turrets
broke
the
blue
of
the
sky
there
does
seem
to
be
any
one
about
said
kathleen
and
yet
all
so
tidy
i
believe
it
is
magic
magic
mowing
machines
jimmy
suggested
if
we
were
in
a
book
it
would
be
an
enchanted
castle
certain
to
be
said
kathleen
it
an
enchanted
castle
said
gerald
in
hollow
tones
but
there
are
any
jimmy
was
quite
positive
how
do
you
know
do
you
think
there
nothing
in
the
world
but
what
seen
his
scorn
was
crushing
i
think
magic
went
out
when
people
began
to
have
jimmy
insisted
and
newspapers
and
telephones
and
wireless
telegraphing
wireless
is
rather
like
magic
when
you
come
to
think
of
it
said
gerald
oh
sort
jimmy
contempt
was
deep
perhaps
there
given
up
being
magic
because
people
did
believe
in
it
any
more
said
kathleen
well
do
let
spoil
the
show
with
any
silly
old
not
believing
said
gerald
with
decision
i
going
to
believe
in
magic
as
hard
as
i
can
this
is
an
enchanted
garden
and
that
an
enchanted
castle
and
i
jolly
well
going
to
explore
the
dauntless
knight
then
led
the
way
leaving
his
ignorant
squires
to
follow
or
not
just
as
they
jolly
well
chose
he
rolled
off
the
balustrade
and
strode
firmly
down
towards
the
lawn
his
boots
making
as
they
went
a
clatter
full
of
determination
the
others
followed
there
never
was
such
a
garden
out
of
a
picture
or
a
fairy
tale
they
passed
quite
close
by
the
deer
who
only
raised
their
pretty
heads
to
look
and
did
not
seem
startled
at
all
and
after
a
long
stretch
of
turf
they
passed
under
the
heavy
masses
of
and
came
into
a
bordered
with
thick
yew
hedges
and
lying
red
and
pink
and
green
and
white
in
the
sun
like
a
giant
i
know
we
shall
meet
a
gardener
in
a
minute
and
he
ask
what
doing
here
and
then
what
will
you
say
kathleen
asked
with
her
nose
in
a
rose
illustration
this
is
an
enchanted
garden
and
that
an
enchanted
castle
i
shall
say
we
lost
our
way
and
it
will
be
quite
true
said
gerald
but
they
did
not
meet
a
gardener
or
anybody
else
and
the
feeling
of
magic
got
thicker
and
thicker
till
they
were
almost
afraid
of
the
sound
of
their
feet
in
the
great
silent
place
beyond
the
rose
garden
was
a
yew
hedge
with
an
arch
cut
in
it
and
it
was
the
beginning
of
a
maze
like
the
one
in
hampton
court
now
said
gerald
you
mark
my
words
in
the
middle
of
this
maze
we
shall
find
the
secret
enchantment
draw
your
swords
my
merry
men
all
and
hark
forward
tallyho
in
the
utmost
silence
which
they
did
it
was
very
hot
in
the
maze
between
the
close
yew
hedges
and
the
way
to
the
maze
heart
was
hidden
well
again
and
again
they
found
themselves
at
the
black
yew
arch
that
opened
on
the
rose
garden
and
they
were
all
glad
that
they
had
brought
large
clean
with
them
it
was
when
they
found
themselves
there
for
the
fourth
time
that
jimmy
suddenly
cried
oh
i
wish
and
then
stopped
short
very
suddenly
oh
he
added
in
quite
a
different
voice
where
the
dinner
and
then
in
a
stricken
silence
they
all
remembered
that
the
basket
with
the
dinner
had
been
left
at
the
entrance
of
the
cave
their
thoughts
dwelt
fondly
on
the
slices
of
cold
mutton
the
six
tomatoes
the
bread
and
butter
the
paper
of
salt
the
apple
turnovers
and
the
little
thick
glass
that
one
drank
the
gingerbeer
out
of
let
go
back
said
jimmy
now
this
minute
and
get
our
things
and
have
our
dinner
let
have
one
more
try
at
the
maze
i
hate
giving
things
up
said
gerald
i
so
hungry
said
jimmy
why
did
you
say
so
before
asked
gerald
bitterly
i
was
before
then
you
ca
be
now
you
do
get
hungry
all
in
a
minute
that
that
was
a
gleam
of
red
that
lay
at
the
foot
of
the
yew
hedge
a
thin
little
line
that
you
would
hardly
have
noticed
unless
you
had
been
staring
in
a
fixed
and
angry
way
at
the
roots
of
the
hedge
it
was
a
thread
of
cotton
gerald
picked
it
up
one
end
of
it
was
tied
to
a
thimble
with
holes
in
it
and
the
other
there
no
other
end
said
gerald
with
firm
triumph
it
a
clue
that
what
it
is
what
price
cold
mutton
now
i
always
felt
something
magic
would
happen
some
day
and
now
it
has
i
expect
the
gardener
put
it
there
said
jimmy
with
a
princess
silver
thimble
on
it
look
there
a
crown
on
the
thimble
there
was
come
said
gerald
in
low
urgent
tones
if
you
are
adventurers
adventurers
and
anyhow
i
expect
some
one
has
gone
along
the
road
and
bagged
the
mutton
hours
ago
he
walked
forward
winding
the
red
thread
round
his
fingers
as
he
went
and
it
a
clue
and
it
led
them
right
into
the
middle
of
the
maze
and
in
the
very
middle
of
the
maze
they
came
upon
the
wonder
the
red
clue
led
them
up
two
stone
steps
to
a
round
grass
plot
there
was
a
in
the
middle
and
all
round
against
the
yew
hedge
a
low
wide
marble
seat
the
red
clue
ran
straight
across
the
grass
and
by
the
and
ended
in
a
small
brown
hand
with
jewelled
rings
on
every
finger
the
hand
was
naturally
attached
to
an
arm
and
that
had
many
bracelets
on
it
sparkling
with
red
and
blue
and
green
stones
the
arm
wore
a
sleeve
of
pink
and
gold
brocaded
silk
faded
a
little
here
and
there
but
still
extremely
imposing
and
the
sleeve
was
part
of
a
dress
which
was
worn
by
a
lady
who
lay
on
the
stone
seat
asleep
in
the
sun
the
rosy
gold
dress
fell
open
over
an
embroidered
petticoat
of
a
soft
green
colour
there
was
old
yellow
lace
the
colour
of
scalded
cream
and
a
thin
white
veil
spangled
with
silver
stars
covered
the
face
it
the
enchanted
princess
said
gerald
now
really
impressed
i
told
you
so
it
the
sleeping
beauty
said
kathleen
it
is
look
how
her
clothes
are
like
the
pictures
of
marie
ladies
in
the
history
book
she
has
slept
for
a
hundred
years
oh
gerald
you
the
eldest
you
must
be
the
prince
and
we
never
knew
it
illustration
the
red
clue
ran
straight
across
the
grass
and
by
the
and
ended
in
a
small
brown
hand
she
is
really
a
princess
said
jimmy
but
the
others
laughed
at
him
partly
because
his
saying
things
like
that
was
enough
to
spoil
any
game
and
partly
because
they
really
were
not
at
all
sure
that
it
was
not
a
princess
who
lay
there
as
still
as
the
sunshine
every
stage
of
the
adventure
the
cave
the
wonderful
gardens
the
maze
the
clue
had
deepened
the
feeling
of
magic
till
now
kathleen
and
gerald
were
almost
completely
bewitched
lift
the
veil
up
jerry
said
kathleen
in
a
whisper
if
she
beautiful
we
shall
know
she
ca
be
the
princess
lift
it
yourself
said
gerald
i
expect
you
forbidden
to
touch
the
figures
said
jimmy
it
not
wax
silly
said
his
brother
no
said
his
sister
wax
would
be
much
good
in
this
sun
and
besides
you
can
see
her
breathing
it
the
princess
right
enough
she
very
gently
lifted
the
edge
of
the
veil
and
turned
it
back
the
princess
face
was
small
and
white
between
long
plaits
of
black
hair
her
nose
was
straight
and
her
brows
finely
traced
there
were
a
few
freckles
on
and
nose
no
wonder
whispered
kathleen
sleeping
all
these
years
in
all
this
sun
her
mouth
was
not
a
rosebud
but
all
the
same
is
she
lovely
kathleen
murmured
not
so
dusty
gerald
was
understood
to
reply
now
jerry
said
kathleen
firmly
you
the
eldest
of
course
i
am
said
gerald
uneasily
well
you
got
to
wake
the
princess
she
not
a
princess
said
jimmy
with
his
hands
in
the
pockets
of
his
knickerbockers
she
only
a
little
girl
dressed
up
but
she
in
long
dresses
urged
kathleen
yes
but
look
what
a
little
way
down
her
frock
her
feet
come
she
would
be
any
taller
than
jerry
if
she
was
to
stand
up
now
then
urged
kathleen
jerry
do
be
silly
you
got
to
do
it
do
what
asked
gerald
kicking
his
left
boot
with
his
right
why
kiss
her
awake
of
course
not
me
was
gerald
unhesitating
rejoinder
well
some
one
got
to
she
go
for
me
as
likely
as
not
the
minute
she
woke
up
said
gerald
anxiously
i
do
it
like
a
shot
said
kathleen
but
i
do
suppose
it
ud
make
any
difference
me
kissing
her
she
did
it
and
it
did
the
princess
still
lay
in
deep
slumber
then
you
must
jimmy
i
daresay
you
do
jump
back
quickly
before
she
can
hit
you
she
wo
hit
him
he
such
a
little
chap
said
gerald
little
yourself
said
jimmy
do
mind
kissing
her
i
not
a
coward
like
some
people
only
if
i
do
i
going
to
be
the
dauntless
leader
for
the
rest
of
the
day
illustration
the
three
stood
breathless
awaiting
the
result
no
look
here
hold
on
cried
gerald
perhaps
i
better
but
in
the
meantime
jimmy
had
planted
a
loud
kiss
on
the
princess
pale
cheek
and
now
the
three
stood
breathless
awaiting
the
result
and
the
result
was
that
the
princess
opened
large
dark
eyes
stretched
out
her
arms
yawned
a
little
covering
her
mouth
with
a
small
brown
hand
and
said
quite
plainly
and
distinctly
and
without
any
room
at
all
for
mistake
then
the
hundred
years
are
over
how
the
yew
hedges
have
grown
which
of
you
is
my
prince
that
aroused
me
from
my
deep
sleep
of
so
many
long
years
i
did
said
jimmy
fearlessly
for
she
did
not
look
as
though
she
were
going
to
slap
any
one
my
noble
preserver
said
the
princess
and
held
out
her
hand
jimmy
shook
it
vigorously
but
i
say
said
he
you
are
really
a
princess
are
you
of
course
i
am
she
answered
who
else
could
i
be
look
at
my
crown
she
pulled
aside
the
spangled
veil
and
showed
beneath
it
a
coronet
of
what
even
jimmy
could
not
help
seeing
to
be
diamonds
but
said
jimmy
why
she
said
opening
her
eyes
very
wide
you
must
have
known
about
my
being
here
or
you
never
have
come
how
you
get
past
the
dragons
gerald
ignored
the
question
i
say
he
said
do
you
really
believe
in
magic
and
all
that
i
ought
to
she
said
if
anybody
does
look
here
the
place
where
i
pricked
my
finger
with
the
spindle
she
showed
a
little
scar
on
her
wrist
then
this
really
an
enchanted
castle
of
course
it
is
said
the
princess
how
stupid
you
are
she
stood
up
and
her
pink
brocaded
dress
lay
in
bright
waves
about
her
feet
i
said
her
dress
would
be
too
long
said
jimmy
it
was
the
right
length
when
i
went
to
sleep
said
the
princess
it
must
have
grown
in
the
hundred
years
i
do
believe
you
a
princess
at
all
said
jimmy
at
least
do
bother
about
believing
it
if
you
do
like
said
the
princess
it
does
so
much
matter
what
you
believe
as
what
i
am
she
turned
to
the
others
let
go
back
to
the
castle
she
said
and
i
show
you
all
my
lovely
jewels
and
things
would
you
like
that
yes
said
gerald
with
very
plain
hesitation
but
but
what
the
princess
tone
was
impatient
but
we
most
awfully
hungry
oh
so
am
i
cried
the
princess
we
had
nothing
to
eat
since
breakfast
and
it
three
now
said
the
princess
looking
at
the
why
you
had
nothing
to
eat
for
hours
and
hours
and
hours
but
think
of
me
i
have
had
anything
to
eat
for
a
hundred
years
come
along
to
the
castle
the
mice
will
have
eaten
everything
said
jimmy
sadly
he
saw
now
that
she
really
a
princess
not
they
cried
the
princess
joyously
you
forget
enchanted
here
time
simply
stood
still
for
a
hundred
years
come
along
and
one
of
you
must
carry
my
train
or
i
sha
be
able
to
move
now
grown
such
a
frightful
length
chapter
ii
when
you
are
young
so
many
things
are
difficult
to
believe
and
yet
the
dullest
people
will
tell
you
that
they
are
true
such
things
for
instance
as
that
the
earth
goes
round
the
sun
and
that
it
is
not
flat
but
round
but
the
things
that
seem
really
likely
like
and
magic
are
so
say
the
not
true
at
all
yet
they
are
so
easy
to
believe
especially
when
you
see
them
happening
and
as
i
am
always
telling
you
the
most
wonderful
things
happen
to
all
sorts
of
people
only
you
never
hear
about
them
because
the
people
think
that
no
one
will
believe
their
stories
and
so
they
do
tell
them
to
any
one
except
me
and
they
tell
me
because
they
know
that
i
can
believe
anything
when
jimmy
had
awakened
the
sleeping
princess
and
she
had
invited
the
three
children
to
go
with
her
to
her
palace
and
get
something
to
eat
they
all
knew
quite
surely
that
they
had
come
into
a
place
of
magic
happenings
and
they
walked
in
a
slow
procession
along
the
grass
towards
the
castle
the
princess
went
first
and
kathleen
carried
her
shining
train
then
came
jimmy
and
gerald
came
last
they
were
all
quite
sure
that
they
had
walked
right
into
the
middle
of
a
fairy
tale
and
they
were
the
more
ready
to
believe
it
because
they
were
so
tired
and
hungry
they
were
in
fact
so
hungry
and
tired
that
they
hardly
noticed
where
they
were
going
or
observed
the
beauties
of
the
formal
gardens
through
which
the
princess
was
leading
them
they
were
in
a
sort
of
dream
from
which
they
only
partially
awakened
to
find
themselves
in
a
big
hall
with
suits
of
armour
and
old
flags
round
the
walls
the
skins
of
beasts
on
the
floor
and
heavy
oak
tables
and
benches
ranged
along
it
the
princess
entered
slow
and
stately
but
once
inside
she
twitched
her
sheeny
train
out
of
jimmy
hand
and
turned
to
the
three
you
just
wait
here
a
minute
she
said
and
mind
you
do
talk
while
i
away
this
castle
is
crammed
with
magic
and
i
do
know
what
will
happen
if
you
talk
and
with
that
picking
up
the
thick
folds
under
her
arms
she
ran
out
as
jimmy
said
afterwards
most
unprincesslike
showing
as
she
ran
black
stockings
and
black
strap
shoes
jimmy
wanted
very
much
to
say
that
he
did
believe
anything
would
happen
only
he
was
afraid
something
would
happen
if
he
did
so
he
merely
made
a
face
and
put
out
his
tongue
the
others
pretended
not
to
see
this
which
was
much
more
crushing
than
anything
they
could
have
said
so
they
sat
in
silence
and
gerald
ground
the
heel
of
his
boot
upon
the
marble
floor
then
the
princess
came
back
very
slowly
and
kicking
her
long
skirts
in
front
of
her
at
every
step
she
could
not
hold
them
up
now
because
of
the
tray
she
carried
it
was
not
a
silver
tray
as
you
might
have
expected
but
an
oblong
tin
one
she
set
it
down
noisily
on
the
end
of
the
long
table
and
breathed
a
sigh
of
relief
oh
it
heavy
she
said
i
do
know
what
fairy
feast
the
children
fancy
had
been
busy
with
anyhow
this
was
nothing
like
it
the
heavy
tray
held
a
loaf
of
bread
a
lump
of
cheese
and
a
brown
jug
of
water
the
rest
of
its
heaviness
was
just
plates
and
mugs
and
knives
come
along
said
the
princess
hospitably
i
could
find
anything
but
bread
and
cheese
but
it
does
matter
because
everything
magic
here
and
unless
you
have
some
dreadful
secret
fault
the
bread
and
cheese
will
turn
into
anything
you
like
what
you
like
she
asked
kathleen
roast
chicken
said
kathleen
without
hesitation
the
pinky
princess
cut
a
slice
of
bread
and
laid
it
on
a
dish
there
you
are
she
said
roast
chicken
shall
i
carve
it
or
will
you
you
please
said
kathleen
and
received
a
piece
of
dry
bread
on
a
plate
green
peas
asked
the
princess
cut
a
piece
of
cheese
and
laid
it
beside
the
bread
kathleen
began
to
eat
the
bread
cutting
it
up
with
knife
and
fork
as
you
would
eat
chicken
it
was
no
use
owning
that
she
did
see
any
chicken
and
peas
or
anything
but
cheese
and
dry
bread
because
that
would
be
owning
that
she
had
some
dreadful
secret
fault
if
i
have
it
a
secret
even
from
me
she
told
herself
the
others
asked
for
roast
beef
and
cabbage
and
got
it
she
supposed
though
to
her
it
only
looked
like
dry
bread
and
dutch
cheese
i
wonder
what
my
dreadful
secret
fault
is
she
thought
as
the
princess
remarked
that
as
for
her
she
could
fancy
a
slice
of
roast
peacock
this
one
she
added
lifting
a
second
mouthful
of
dry
bread
on
her
fork
is
quite
delicious
it
a
game
is
it
asked
jimmy
suddenly
what
a
game
asked
the
princess
frowning
pretending
it
beef
the
bread
and
cheese
i
mean
a
game
but
it
beef
look
at
it
said
the
princess
opening
her
eyes
very
wide
yes
of
course
said
jimmy
feebly
i
was
only
joking
illustration
it
a
game
is
it
asked
jimmy
bread
and
cheese
is
not
perhaps
so
good
as
roast
beef
or
chicken
or
peacock
i
not
sure
about
the
peacock
i
never
tasted
peacock
did
you
but
bread
and
cheese
is
at
any
rate
very
much
better
than
nothing
when
you
have
gone
on
having
nothing
since
breakfast
gooseberries
and
gingerbeer
hardly
count
and
it
is
long
past
your
proper
every
one
ate
and
drank
and
felt
much
better
now
said
the
princess
brushing
the
breadcrumbs
off
her
green
silk
lap
if
you
sure
you
wo
have
any
more
meat
you
can
come
and
see
my
treasures
sure
you
wo
take
the
least
bit
more
chicken
no
then
follow
me
she
got
up
and
they
followed
her
down
the
long
hall
to
the
end
where
the
great
stone
stairs
ran
up
at
each
side
and
joined
in
a
broad
flight
leading
to
the
gallery
above
under
the
stairs
was
a
hanging
of
tapestry
beneath
this
arras
said
the
princess
is
the
door
leading
to
my
private
apartments
she
held
the
tapestry
up
with
both
hands
for
it
was
heavy
and
showed
a
little
door
that
had
been
hidden
by
it
the
key
she
said
hangs
above
and
so
it
did
on
a
large
rusty
nail
put
it
in
said
the
princess
and
turn
it
gerald
did
so
and
the
great
key
creaked
and
grated
in
the
lock
now
push
she
said
push
hard
all
of
you
they
pushed
hard
all
of
them
the
door
gave
way
and
they
fell
over
each
other
into
the
dark
space
beyond
the
princess
dropped
the
curtain
and
came
after
them
closing
the
door
behind
her
look
out
she
said
look
out
there
are
two
steps
down
thank
you
said
gerald
rubbing
his
knee
at
the
bottom
of
the
steps
we
found
that
out
for
ourselves
i
sorry
said
the
princess
but
you
ca
have
hurt
yourselves
much
go
straight
on
there
are
any
more
steps
they
went
straight
on
in
the
dark
when
you
come
to
the
door
just
turn
the
handle
and
go
in
then
stand
still
till
i
find
the
matches
i
know
where
they
are
did
they
have
matches
a
hundred
years
ago
asked
jimmy
i
meant
the
said
the
princess
quickly
we
always
called
it
the
matches
do
you
here
let
me
go
first
she
did
and
when
they
had
reached
the
door
she
was
waiting
for
them
with
a
candle
in
her
hand
she
thrust
it
on
gerald
hold
it
steady
she
said
and
undid
the
shutters
of
a
long
window
so
that
first
a
yellow
streak
and
then
a
blazing
great
oblong
of
light
flashed
at
them
and
the
room
was
full
of
sunshine
it
makes
the
candle
look
quite
silly
said
jimmy
so
it
does
said
the
princess
and
blew
out
the
candle
then
she
took
the
key
from
the
outside
of
the
door
put
it
in
the
inside
and
turned
it
illustration
she
was
waiting
for
them
with
a
candle
in
her
hand
the
room
they
were
in
was
small
and
high
its
domed
ceiling
was
of
deep
blue
with
gold
stars
painted
on
it
the
walls
were
of
wood
panelled
and
carved
and
there
was
no
furniture
in
it
whatever
this
said
the
princess
is
my
treasure
chamber
but
where
asked
kathleen
politely
the
treasures
do
you
see
them
asked
the
princess
no
we
do
said
jimmy
bluntly
you
do
come
that
game
with
me
not
twice
over
you
do
if
you
do
see
them
said
the
princess
i
suppose
i
shall
have
to
say
the
charm
shut
your
eyes
please
and
give
me
your
word
of
honour
you
wo
look
till
i
tell
you
and
that
you
never
tell
any
one
what
you
seen
their
words
of
honour
were
something
that
the
children
would
rather
not
have
given
just
then
but
they
gave
them
all
the
same
and
shut
their
eyes
tight
wiggadil
yougadoo
begadee
leegadeeve
nowgadow
said
the
princess
rapidly
and
they
heard
the
swish
of
her
silk
train
moving
across
the
room
then
there
was
a
creaking
rustling
noise
she
locking
us
in
cried
jimmy
your
word
of
honour
gasped
gerald
oh
do
be
quick
moaned
kathleen
you
may
look
said
the
voice
of
the
princess
and
they
looked
the
room
was
not
the
same
room
yet
yes
the
blue
ceiling
was
there
and
below
it
half
a
dozen
feet
of
the
dark
panelling
but
below
that
the
walls
of
the
room
blazed
and
sparkled
with
white
and
blue
and
red
and
green
and
gold
and
silver
shelves
ran
round
the
room
and
on
them
were
gold
cups
and
silver
dishes
and
platters
and
goblets
set
with
gems
ornaments
of
gold
and
silver
tiaras
of
diamonds
necklaces
of
rubies
strings
of
emeralds
and
pearls
all
set
out
in
unimaginable
splendour
against
a
background
of
faded
blue
velvet
it
was
like
the
crown
jewels
that
you
see
when
your
kind
uncle
takes
you
to
the
tower
only
there
seemed
to
be
far
more
jewels
than
you
or
any
one
else
has
ever
seen
together
at
the
tower
or
anywhere
else
the
three
children
remained
breathless
staring
at
the
sparkling
splendours
all
about
them
while
the
princess
stood
her
arm
stretched
out
in
a
gesture
of
command
and
a
proud
smile
on
her
lips
my
word
said
gerald
in
a
low
whisper
but
no
one
spoke
out
loud
they
waited
as
if
spellbound
for
the
princess
to
speak
she
spoke
what
price
games
now
she
asked
triumphantly
can
i
do
magic
or
ca
i
you
can
oh
you
can
said
kathleen
may
we
may
we
asked
gerald
all
that
is
mine
is
yours
said
the
princess
with
a
generous
wave
of
her
brown
hand
and
added
quickly
only
of
course
you
must
take
anything
away
with
you
we
not
thieves
said
jimmy
the
others
were
already
busy
turning
over
the
wonderful
things
on
the
blue
velvet
shelves
perhaps
not
said
the
princess
but
you
a
very
unbelieving
little
boy
you
think
i
ca
see
inside
you
but
i
can
know
what
been
thinking
what
asked
jimmy
oh
you
know
well
enough
said
the
princess
you
thinking
about
the
bread
and
cheese
that
i
changed
into
beef
and
about
your
secret
fault
i
say
let
all
dress
up
and
you
be
princes
and
princesses
too
to
crown
our
hero
said
gerald
lifting
a
gold
crown
with
a
cross
on
the
top
was
the
work
of
a
moment
he
put
the
crown
on
his
head
and
added
a
collar
of
ss
and
a
zone
of
sparkling
emeralds
which
would
not
quite
meet
round
his
middle
he
turned
from
fixing
it
by
an
ingenious
adaptation
of
his
belt
to
find
the
others
already
decked
with
diadems
necklaces
and
rings
how
splendid
you
look
said
the
princess
and
how
i
wish
your
clothes
were
prettier
what
ugly
clothes
people
wear
nowadays
a
hundred
years
ago
kathleen
stood
quite
still
with
a
diamond
bracelet
raised
in
her
hand
i
say
she
said
the
king
and
queen
king
and
queen
asked
the
princess
your
father
and
mother
your
sorrowing
parents
said
kathleen
they
have
waked
up
by
now
wo
they
be
wanting
to
see
you
after
a
hundred
years
you
know
oh
ah
yes
said
the
princess
slowly
i
embraced
my
rejoicing
parents
when
i
got
the
bread
and
cheese
they
having
their
dinner
they
wo
expect
me
yet
here
she
added
hastily
putting
a
ruby
bracelet
on
kathleen
arm
see
how
splendid
that
is
kathleen
would
have
been
quite
content
to
go
on
all
day
trying
on
different
jewels
and
looking
at
herself
in
the
little
mirror
that
the
princess
took
from
one
of
the
shelves
but
the
boys
were
soon
weary
of
this
amusement
look
here
said
gerald
if
you
sure
your
father
and
mother
want
you
let
go
out
and
have
a
jolly
good
game
of
something
you
could
play
besieged
castles
awfully
well
in
that
maze
unless
you
can
do
any
more
magic
tricks
you
forget
said
the
princess
i
grown
up
i
do
play
games
and
i
do
like
to
do
too
much
magic
at
a
time
it
so
tiring
besides
it
take
us
ever
so
long
to
put
all
these
things
back
in
their
proper
places
it
did
the
children
would
have
laid
the
jewels
just
anywhere
but
the
princess
showed
them
that
every
necklace
or
ring
or
bracelet
had
its
own
home
on
the
velvet
a
slight
hollowing
in
the
shelf
beneath
so
that
each
stone
fitted
into
its
own
little
nest
illustration
kathleen
looking
at
herself
in
the
little
mirror
as
kathleen
was
fitting
the
last
shining
ornament
into
its
proper
place
she
saw
that
part
of
the
shelf
near
it
held
not
bright
jewels
but
rings
and
brooches
and
chains
as
well
as
queer
things
that
she
did
not
know
the
names
of
and
all
were
of
dull
metal
and
odd
shapes
what
all
this
rubbish
she
asked
rubbish
indeed
said
the
princess
why
those
are
magic
things
this
bracelet
any
one
who
wears
it
has
got
to
speak
the
truth
this
chain
makes
you
as
strong
as
ten
men
if
you
wear
this
spur
your
horse
will
go
a
mile
a
minute
or
if
you
walking
it
the
same
as
boots
what
does
this
brooch
do
asked
kathleen
reaching
out
her
hand
the
princess
caught
her
by
the
wrist
you
must
touch
she
said
if
any
one
but
me
touches
them
all
the
magic
goes
out
at
once
and
never
comes
back
that
brooch
will
give
you
any
wish
you
like
and
this
ring
jimmy
pointed
oh
that
makes
you
invisible
what
this
asked
gerald
showing
a
curious
buckle
oh
that
undoes
the
effect
of
all
the
other
charms
do
you
mean
jimmy
asked
you
not
just
kidding
kidding
indeed
repeated
the
princess
scornfully
i
should
have
thought
i
shown
you
enough
magic
to
prevent
you
speaking
to
a
princess
like
i
say
said
gerald
visibly
excited
you
might
show
us
how
some
of
the
things
act
could
you
give
us
each
a
wish
the
princess
did
not
at
once
answer
and
the
minds
of
the
three
played
with
granted
wishes
brilliant
yet
thoroughly
reasonable
the
kind
of
wish
that
never
seems
to
occur
to
people
in
fairy
tales
when
they
suddenly
get
a
chance
to
have
their
three
wishes
granted
no
said
the
princess
suddenly
no
i
ca
give
wishes
to
it
only
gives
me
wishes
but
i
let
you
see
the
ring
make
invisible
only
you
must
shut
your
eyes
while
i
do
it
they
shut
them
count
fifty
said
the
princess
and
then
you
may
look
and
then
you
must
shut
them
again
and
count
fifty
and
i
reappear
gerald
counted
aloud
through
the
counting
one
could
hear
a
creaking
rustling
sound
fifty
said
gerald
and
they
opened
their
eyes
they
were
alone
in
the
room
the
jewels
had
vanished
and
so
had
the
princess
she
gone
out
by
the
door
of
course
said
jimmy
but
the
door
was
locked
that
magic
said
kathleen
breathlessly
maskelyne
and
devant
can
do
trick
said
jimmy
and
i
want
my
tea
your
tea
gerald
tone
was
full
of
contempt
the
lovely
princess
he
went
on
reappeared
as
soon
as
our
hero
had
finished
counting
fifty
one
two
three
four
gerald
and
kathleen
had
both
closed
their
eyes
but
somehow
jimmy
had
he
did
mean
to
cheat
he
just
forgot
and
as
gerald
count
reached
twenty
he
saw
a
panel
under
the
window
open
slowly
her
he
said
to
himself
i
it
was
a
trick
and
at
once
shut
his
eyes
like
an
honourable
little
boy
on
the
word
fifty
six
eyes
opened
and
the
panel
was
closed
and
there
was
no
princess
she
has
pulled
it
off
this
time
said
gerald
perhaps
you
better
count
again
said
kathleen
i
believe
there
a
cupboard
under
the
window
said
jimmy
and
hidden
in
it
secret
panel
you
know
you
looked
that
cheating
said
the
voice
of
the
princess
so
close
to
his
ear
that
he
quite
jumped
i
did
cheat
where
on
earth
what
ever
said
all
three
together
for
still
there
was
no
princess
to
be
seen
come
back
visible
princess
dear
said
kathleen
shall
we
shut
our
eyes
and
count
again
do
be
silly
said
the
voice
of
the
princess
and
it
sounded
very
cross
we
silly
said
jimmy
and
his
voice
was
cross
too
why
you
come
back
and
have
done
with
it
you
know
you
only
hiding
do
said
kathleen
gently
she
invisible
you
know
so
should
i
be
if
i
got
into
the
cupboard
said
jimmy
oh
yes
said
the
sneering
tone
of
the
princess
you
think
yourselves
very
clever
i
dare
say
but
do
mind
we
play
that
you
see
me
if
you
like
well
but
we
said
gerald
it
no
use
getting
in
a
wax
if
you
hiding
as
jimmy
says
you
better
come
out
if
you
really
turned
invisible
you
better
make
yourself
visible
again
do
you
really
mean
asked
a
voice
quite
changed
but
still
the
princess
that
you
see
me
ca
you
we
ca
asked
jimmy
rather
unreasonably
the
sun
was
blazing
in
at
the
window
the
room
was
very
hot
and
every
one
was
getting
cross
you
ca
me
there
was
the
sound
of
a
sob
in
the
voice
of
the
invisible
princess
i
tell
you
said
jimmy
and
i
want
my
tea
and
what
he
was
saying
was
broken
off
short
as
one
might
break
a
stick
of
sealing
wax
and
then
in
the
golden
afternoon
a
really
quite
horrid
thing
happened
jimmy
suddenly
leaned
backwards
then
forwards
his
eyes
opened
wide
and
his
mouth
too
backward
and
forward
he
went
very
quickly
and
abruptly
then
stood
still
oh
he
in
a
fit
oh
jimmy
dear
jimmy
cried
kathleen
hurrying
to
him
what
is
it
dear
what
is
it
it
a
fit
gasped
jimmy
angrily
she
shook
me
illustration
backward
and
forward
he
went
yes
said
the
voice
of
the
princess
and
i
shake
him
again
if
he
keeps
on
saying
he
ca
see
me
you
better
shake
said
gerald
angrily
i
nearer
your
own
size
and
instantly
she
did
but
not
for
long
the
moment
gerald
felt
hands
on
his
shoulders
he
put
up
his
own
and
caught
those
other
hands
by
the
wrists
and
there
he
was
holding
wrists
that
he
could
see
it
was
a
dreadful
sensation
an
invisible
kick
made
him
wince
but
he
held
tight
to
the
wrists
cathy
he
cried
come
and
hold
her
legs
she
kicking
me
where
cried
kathleen
anxious
to
help
i
do
any
legs
this
is
her
hands
i
got
cried
gerald
she
invisible
right
enough
get
hold
of
this
hand
and
then
you
can
feel
your
way
down
to
her
legs
kathleen
did
so
i
wish
i
could
make
you
understand
how
very
very
uncomfortable
and
frightening
it
is
to
feel
in
broad
daylight
hands
and
arms
that
you
ca
see
i
have
you
hold
my
legs
said
the
invisible
princess
struggling
violently
what
are
you
so
cross
about
gerald
was
quite
calm
you
said
you
be
invisible
and
you
i
not
you
are
really
look
in
the
glass
i
not
i
ca
be
look
in
the
glass
gerald
repeated
quite
unmoved
let
go
then
she
said
gerald
did
and
the
moment
he
had
done
so
he
found
it
impossible
to
believe
that
he
really
had
been
holding
invisible
hands
you
just
pretending
not
to
see
me
said
the
princess
anxiously
are
you
do
say
you
are
you
had
your
joke
with
me
do
keep
it
up
i
do
like
it
on
our
sacred
word
of
honour
said
gerald
you
still
invisible
there
was
a
silence
then
come
said
the
princess
i
let
you
out
and
you
can
go
i
tired
of
playing
with
you
they
followed
her
voice
to
the
door
and
through
it
and
along
the
little
passage
into
the
hall
no
one
said
anything
every
one
felt
very
uncomfortable
let
get
out
of
this
whispered
jimmy
as
they
got
to
the
end
of
the
hall
but
the
voice
of
the
princess
said
come
out
this
way
it
quicker
i
think
you
perfectly
hateful
i
sorry
i
ever
played
with
you
mother
always
told
me
not
to
play
with
strange
children
a
door
abruptly
opened
though
no
hand
was
seen
to
touch
it
come
through
ca
you
said
the
voice
of
the
princess
it
was
a
little
with
long
narrow
mirrors
between
its
long
narrow
windows
goodbye
said
gerald
thanks
for
giving
us
such
a
jolly
time
part
friends
he
added
holding
out
his
hand
an
unseen
hand
was
slowly
put
in
his
which
closed
on
it
now
he
said
you
jolly
well
to
look
in
the
glass
and
own
that
we
not
liars
he
led
the
invisible
princess
to
one
of
the
mirrors
and
held
her
in
front
of
it
by
the
shoulders
now
he
said
you
just
look
for
yourself
there
was
a
silence
and
then
a
cry
of
despair
rang
through
the
room
oh
oh
oh
i
invisible
whatever
shall
i
do
take
the
ring
off
said
kathleen
suddenly
practical
another
silence
i
cried
the
princess
it
wo
come
off
but
it
ca
be
the
ring
rings
do
make
you
invisible
you
said
this
one
did
said
kathleen
and
it
has
but
it
said
the
princess
i
was
only
playing
at
magic
i
just
hid
in
the
secret
cupboard
it
was
only
a
game
oh
whatever
i
do
a
game
said
gerald
slowly
but
you
do
magic
the
invisible
jewels
and
you
made
them
come
visible
oh
it
only
a
secret
spring
and
the
panelling
slides
up
oh
what
am
i
to
do
kathleen
moved
towards
the
voice
and
gropingly
got
her
arms
round
a
waist
that
she
could
see
invisible
arms
clasped
her
a
hot
invisible
cheek
was
laid
against
hers
and
warm
invisible
tears
lay
wet
between
the
two
faces
do
cry
dear
said
kathleen
let
me
go
and
tell
the
king
and
queen
the
your
royal
father
and
mother
oh
mock
me
said
the
poor
princess
you
that
was
only
a
game
too
like
like
the
bread
and
cheese
said
jimmy
triumphantly
i
knew
was
but
your
dress
and
being
asleep
in
the
maze
and
oh
i
dressed
up
for
fun
because
every
one
away
at
the
fair
and
i
put
the
clue
just
to
make
it
all
more
real
i
was
playing
at
fair
rosamond
first
and
then
i
heard
you
talking
in
the
maze
and
i
thought
what
fun
and
now
i
invisible
and
i
shall
never
come
right
again
never
i
know
i
sha
it
serves
me
right
for
lying
but
i
really
think
you
believe
it
not
more
than
half
that
is
she
added
hastily
trying
to
be
truthful
but
if
you
not
the
princess
who
you
asked
kathleen
still
embracing
the
unseen
i
my
aunt
lives
here
said
the
invisible
princess
she
may
be
home
any
time
oh
what
shall
i
do
perhaps
she
knows
some
charm
oh
nonsense
said
the
voice
sharply
she
does
believe
in
charms
she
be
so
vexed
oh
i
dare
let
her
see
me
like
this
she
added
wildly
and
all
of
you
here
too
she
be
so
dreadfully
cross
the
beautiful
magic
castle
that
the
children
had
believed
in
now
felt
as
though
it
were
tumbling
about
their
ears
all
that
was
left
was
the
invisibleness
of
the
princess
but
that
you
will
own
was
a
good
deal
i
just
said
it
moaned
the
voice
and
it
came
true
i
wish
i
never
played
at
magic
i
wish
i
never
played
at
anything
at
all
oh
do
say
that
gerald
said
kindly
let
go
out
into
the
garden
near
the
lake
where
it
cool
and
we
hold
a
solemn
council
like
that
wo
you
oh
cried
kathleen
suddenly
the
buckle
that
makes
magic
come
undone
it
does
murmured
the
voice
that
seemed
to
speak
without
lips
i
only
just
that
you
only
said
about
the
ring
said
gerald
anyhow
let
try
not
said
the
voice
you
go
down
to
the
temple
of
flora
by
the
lake
i
go
back
to
the
by
myself
aunt
might
see
you
she
wo
see
said
jimmy
do
rub
it
in
said
gerald
where
the
temple
of
flora
that
the
way
the
voice
said
down
those
steps
and
along
the
winding
path
through
the
shrubbery
you
ca
miss
it
it
white
marble
with
a
statue
goddess
inside
the
three
children
went
down
to
the
white
marble
temple
of
flora
that
stood
close
against
the
side
of
the
little
hill
and
sat
down
in
its
shadowy
inside
it
had
arches
all
round
except
against
the
hill
behind
the
statue
and
it
was
cool
and
restful
they
had
not
been
there
five
minutes
before
the
feet
of
a
runner
sounded
loud
on
the
gravel
a
shadow
very
black
and
distinct
fell
on
the
white
marble
floor
your
shadow
not
invisible
anyhow
said
jimmy
oh
bother
my
shadow
the
voice
of
the
princess
replied
we
left
the
key
inside
the
door
and
it
shut
itself
with
the
wind
and
it
a
spring
lock
there
was
a
heartfelt
pause
then
gerald
said
in
his
most
manner
sit
down
princess
and
we
have
a
thorough
good
palaver
about
it
i
should
wonder
said
jimmy
if
we
was
to
wake
up
and
find
it
was
dreams
no
such
luck
said
the
voice
well
said
gerald
first
of
all
what
your
name
and
if
you
not
a
princess
who
are
you
i
i
said
a
voice
broken
with
sobs
the
housekeeper
niece
at
the
castle
and
my
name
mabel
prowse
that
exactly
what
i
thought
said
jimmy
without
a
shadow
of
truth
because
how
could
he
the
others
were
silent
it
was
a
moment
full
of
agitation
and
confused
ideas
well
anyhow
said
gerald
you
belong
here
illustration
your
shadow
not
invisible
anyhow
said
jimmy
yes
said
the
voice
and
it
came
from
the
floor
as
though
its
owner
had
flung
herself
down
in
the
madness
of
despair
oh
yes
i
belong
here
right
enough
but
what
the
use
of
belonging
anywhere
if
invisible
chapter
iii
those
of
my
readers
who
have
gone
about
much
with
an
invisible
companion
will
not
need
to
be
told
how
awkward
the
whole
business
is
for
one
thing
however
much
you
may
have
been
convinced
that
your
companion
invisible
you
will
i
feel
sure
have
found
yourself
every
now
and
then
saying
this
be
a
dream
or
i
i
shall
wake
up
in
half
a
sec
and
this
was
the
case
with
gerald
kathleen
and
jimmy
as
they
sat
in
the
white
marble
temple
of
flora
looking
out
through
its
arches
at
the
sunshiny
park
and
listening
to
the
voice
of
the
enchanted
princess
who
really
was
not
a
princess
at
all
but
just
the
housekeeper
niece
mabel
prowse
though
as
jimmy
said
she
was
enchanted
right
enough
it
no
use
talking
she
said
again
and
again
and
the
voice
came
from
an
space
between
two
pillars
i
never
believed
anything
would
happen
and
now
it
has
well
said
gerald
kindly
can
we
do
anything
for
you
because
if
not
i
think
we
ought
to
be
going
yes
said
jimmy
i
want
my
tea
tea
said
the
unseen
mabel
scornfully
do
you
mean
to
say
you
go
off
to
your
teas
and
leave
me
after
getting
me
into
this
mess
well
of
all
the
unfair
princesses
i
ever
met
gerald
began
but
kathleen
interrupted
oh
do
rag
her
she
said
think
how
horrid
it
must
be
to
be
invisible
i
do
think
said
the
hidden
mabel
that
my
aunt
likes
me
very
much
as
it
is
she
would
let
me
go
to
the
fair
because
i
forgotten
to
put
back
some
old
trumpery
shoe
that
queen
elizabeth
wore
i
got
it
out
from
the
glass
case
to
try
it
on
did
it
fit
asked
kathleen
with
interest
not
it
much
too
small
said
mabel
i
do
believe
it
ever
fitted
any
one
i
do
want
my
tea
said
jimmy
i
do
really
think
perhaps
we
ought
to
go
said
gerald
you
see
it
is
as
if
we
could
do
anything
for
you
you
have
to
tell
your
aunt
said
kathleen
kindly
no
no
no
moaned
mabel
invisibly
take
me
with
you
i
leave
her
a
note
to
say
i
run
away
to
sea
girls
do
run
away
to
sea
they
might
said
the
stone
floor
between
the
pillars
as
stowaways
if
nobody
wanted
a
cabin
boy
cabin
girl
i
mean
i
sure
you
ought
said
kathleen
firmly
well
what
i
to
do
really
said
gerald
i
do
know
what
the
girl
do
let
her
come
home
with
us
and
have
tea
oh
yes
said
jimmy
jumping
up
and
have
a
good
council
after
tea
said
jimmy
but
her
aunt
find
she
gone
so
she
would
if
i
stayed
oh
come
on
said
jimmy
but
the
aunt
think
something
happened
to
her
so
it
has
and
she
tell
the
police
and
they
look
everywhere
for
me
they
never
find
you
said
gerald
talk
of
impenetrable
disguises
i
sure
said
mabel
aunt
would
much
rather
never
see
me
again
than
see
me
like
this
she
never
get
over
it
it
might
kill
her
she
has
spasms
as
it
is
i
write
to
her
and
we
put
it
in
the
big
at
the
gate
as
we
go
out
has
any
one
got
a
bit
of
pencil
and
a
scrap
of
paper
gerald
had
a
with
leaves
of
the
shiny
kind
which
you
have
to
write
on
not
with
a
blacklead
pencil
but
with
an
ivory
thing
with
a
point
of
real
lead
and
it
wo
write
on
any
other
paper
except
the
kind
that
is
in
the
book
and
this
is
often
very
annoying
when
you
are
in
a
hurry
then
was
seen
the
strange
spectacle
of
a
little
ivory
stick
with
a
leaden
point
standing
up
at
an
odd
slant
and
moving
along
all
by
itself
as
ordinary
pencils
do
when
you
are
writing
with
them
may
we
look
over
asked
kathleen
there
was
no
answer
the
pencil
went
on
writing
may
we
look
over
kathleen
said
again
of
course
you
may
said
the
voice
near
the
paper
i
nodded
did
i
oh
i
forgot
my
nodding
invisible
too
the
pencil
was
forming
round
clear
letters
on
the
page
torn
out
of
the
this
is
what
it
wrote
dear
aunt
i
am
afraid
you
will
not
see
me
again
for
some
time
a
lady
in
a
has
adopted
me
and
we
are
going
straight
to
the
coast
and
then
in
a
ship
it
is
useless
to
try
to
follow
me
farewell
and
may
you
be
happy
i
hope
you
enjoyed
the
fair
mabel
but
that
all
lies
said
jimmy
bluntly
no
it
is
it
fancy
said
mabel
if
i
said
i
become
invisible
she
think
that
was
a
lie
anyhow
oh
along
said
jimmy
you
can
quarrel
just
as
well
walking
gerald
folded
up
the
note
as
a
lady
in
india
had
taught
him
to
do
years
before
and
mabel
led
them
by
another
and
very
much
nearer
way
out
of
the
park
and
the
walk
home
was
a
great
deal
shorter
too
than
the
walk
out
had
been
the
sky
had
clouded
over
while
they
were
in
the
temple
of
flora
and
the
first
spots
of
rain
fell
as
they
got
back
to
the
house
very
late
indeed
for
tea
mademoiselle
was
looking
out
of
the
window
and
came
herself
to
open
the
door
but
it
is
that
you
are
in
lateness
in
lateness
she
cried
you
have
had
a
misfortune
no
all
goes
well
we
are
very
sorry
indeed
said
gerald
it
took
us
longer
to
get
home
than
we
expected
i
do
hope
you
have
been
anxious
i
have
been
thinking
about
you
most
of
the
way
home
go
then
said
the
french
lady
smiling
you
shall
have
them
in
the
same
time
the
tea
and
the
supper
which
they
did
how
you
say
you
were
thinking
about
her
all
the
time
said
a
voice
just
by
gerald
ear
when
mademoiselle
had
left
them
alone
with
the
bread
and
butter
and
milk
and
baked
apples
it
was
just
as
much
a
lie
as
me
being
adopted
by
a
motor
lady
no
it
was
said
gerald
through
bread
and
butter
i
thinking
about
whether
she
be
in
a
wax
or
not
so
there
illustration
it
was
rather
horrid
to
see
the
bread
and
butter
waving
about
in
the
air
there
were
only
three
plates
but
jimmy
let
mabel
have
his
and
shared
with
kathleen
it
was
rather
horrid
to
see
the
bread
and
butter
waving
about
in
the
air
and
bite
after
bite
disappearing
from
it
apparently
by
no
human
agency
and
the
spoon
rising
with
apple
in
it
and
returning
to
the
plate
empty
even
the
tip
of
the
spoon
disappeared
as
long
as
it
was
in
mabel
unseen
mouth
so
that
at
times
it
looked
as
though
its
bowl
had
been
broken
off
every
one
was
very
hungry
and
more
bread
and
butter
had
to
be
fetched
cook
grumbled
when
the
plate
was
filled
for
the
third
time
i
tell
you
what
said
jimmy
i
did
want
my
tea
i
tell
what
said
gerald
it
be
jolly
difficult
to
give
mabel
any
breakfast
mademoiselle
will
be
here
then
she
have
a
fit
if
she
saw
bits
of
forks
with
bacon
on
them
vanishing
and
then
the
forks
coming
back
out
of
vanishment
and
the
bacon
lost
for
ever
we
shall
have
to
buy
things
to
eat
and
feed
our
poor
captive
in
secret
said
kathleen
our
money
wo
last
long
said
jimmy
in
gloom
have
got
any
money
he
turned
to
where
a
mug
of
milk
was
suspended
in
the
air
without
visible
means
of
support
i
not
got
much
money
was
the
reply
from
near
the
milk
but
got
heaps
of
ideas
we
must
talk
about
everything
in
the
morning
said
kathleen
we
must
just
say
to
mademoiselle
and
then
you
shall
sleep
in
my
bed
mabel
i
lend
you
one
of
my
nightgowns
i
get
my
own
said
mabel
cheerfully
you
go
back
to
get
things
why
not
nobody
can
see
me
i
think
i
begin
to
see
all
sorts
of
amusing
things
coming
along
it
not
half
bad
being
invisible
it
was
extremely
odd
kathleen
thought
to
see
the
princess
clothes
coming
out
of
nothing
first
the
gauzy
veil
appeared
hanging
in
the
air
then
the
sparkling
coronet
suddenly
showed
on
the
top
of
the
chest
of
drawers
then
a
sleeve
of
the
pinky
gown
showed
then
another
and
then
the
whole
gown
lay
on
the
floor
in
a
glistening
ring
as
the
unseen
legs
of
mabel
stepped
out
of
it
for
each
article
of
clothing
became
visible
as
mabel
took
it
off
the
nightgown
lifted
from
the
bed
disappeared
a
bit
at
a
time
get
into
bed
said
kathleen
rather
nervously
the
bed
creaked
and
a
hollow
appeared
in
the
pillow
kathleen
put
out
the
gas
and
got
into
bed
all
this
magic
had
been
rather
upsetting
and
she
was
just
the
least
bit
frightened
but
in
the
dark
she
found
it
was
not
so
bad
mabel
arms
went
round
her
neck
the
moment
she
got
into
bed
and
the
two
little
girls
kissed
in
the
kind
darkness
where
the
visible
and
the
invisible
could
meet
on
equal
terms
said
mabel
you
a
darling
cathy
you
been
most
awfully
good
to
me
and
i
forget
it
i
did
like
to
say
so
before
the
boys
because
i
know
boys
think
you
a
muff
if
grateful
but
i
kathleen
lay
awake
for
some
time
she
was
just
getting
sleepy
when
she
remembered
that
the
maid
who
would
call
them
in
the
morning
would
see
those
wonderful
princess
clothes
i
have
to
get
up
and
hide
them
she
said
what
a
bother
and
as
she
lay
thinking
what
a
bother
it
was
she
happened
to
fall
asleep
and
when
she
woke
again
it
was
bright
morning
and
eliza
was
standing
in
front
of
the
chair
where
mabel
clothes
lay
gazing
at
the
pink
that
lay
on
the
top
of
her
heap
and
saying
law
oh
do
touch
kathleen
leaped
out
of
bed
as
eliza
was
reaching
out
her
hand
where
on
earth
did
you
get
hold
of
that
we
going
to
use
it
for
acting
said
kathleen
on
the
desperate
inspiration
of
the
moment
it
lent
me
for
that
you
might
show
miss
suggested
eliza
oh
please
not
said
kathleen
standing
in
front
of
the
chair
in
her
nightgown
you
shall
see
us
act
when
we
are
dressed
up
there
and
you
wo
tell
any
one
will
you
not
if
you
a
good
little
girl
said
eliza
but
you
be
sure
to
let
me
see
when
you
dress
up
but
where
here
a
bell
rang
and
eliza
had
to
go
for
it
was
the
postman
and
she
particularly
wanted
to
see
him
and
now
said
kathleen
pulling
on
her
first
stocking
we
shall
have
to
the
acting
everything
seems
very
difficult
acting
is
said
mabel
and
an
unsupported
stocking
waved
in
the
air
and
quickly
vanished
i
shall
love
it
you
forget
said
kathleen
gently
invisible
actresses
ca
take
part
in
plays
unless
they
magic
ones
oh
cried
a
voice
from
under
a
petticoat
that
hung
in
the
air
got
an
idea
tell
it
us
after
breakfast
said
kathleen
as
the
water
in
the
basin
began
to
splash
about
and
to
drip
from
nowhere
back
into
itself
and
oh
i
do
wish
you
had
written
such
whoppers
to
your
aunt
i
sure
we
ought
to
tell
lies
for
anything
what
the
use
of
telling
the
truth
if
nobody
believes
you
came
from
among
the
splashes
i
do
know
said
kathleen
but
i
sure
we
ought
to
tell
the
truth
can
if
you
like
said
a
voice
from
the
folds
of
a
towel
that
waved
lonely
in
front
of
the
stand
all
right
we
will
then
first
thing
after
brek
brek
i
mean
you
have
to
wait
up
here
till
we
can
collar
something
and
bring
it
up
to
you
mind
you
dodge
eliza
when
she
comes
to
make
the
bed
the
invisible
mabel
found
this
a
fairly
amusing
game
she
further
enlivened
it
by
twitching
out
the
corners
of
sheets
and
blankets
when
eliza
was
looking
drat
the
clothes
said
eliza
anyone
ud
think
the
things
was
bewitched
she
looked
about
for
the
wonderful
princess
clothes
she
had
glimpsed
earlier
in
the
morning
but
kathleen
had
hidden
them
in
a
perfectly
safe
place
under
the
mattress
which
she
knew
eliza
never
turned
eliza
hastily
brushed
up
from
the
floor
those
bits
of
fluff
which
come
from
goodness
knows
where
in
the
best
regulated
houses
mabel
very
hungry
and
exasperated
at
the
long
absence
of
the
others
at
their
breakfast
could
not
forbear
to
whisper
suddenly
in
eliza
ear
always
sweep
under
the
mats
the
maid
started
and
turned
pale
i
must
be
going
silly
she
murmured
though
it
just
what
mother
always
used
to
say
hope
i
ai
going
dotty
like
aunt
emily
wonderful
what
you
can
fancy
ai
it
she
took
up
the
all
the
same
swept
under
it
and
under
the
fender
so
thorough
was
she
and
so
pale
that
kathleen
entering
with
a
chunk
of
bread
raided
by
gerald
from
the
pantry
window
exclaimed
not
done
yet
i
say
eliza
you
do
look
ill
what
the
matter
i
thought
i
give
the
room
a
good
said
eliza
still
very
pale
nothing
happened
to
upset
you
kathleen
asked
she
had
her
own
private
fears
nothing
only
my
fancy
miss
said
eliza
i
always
was
fanciful
from
a
child
dreaming
of
the
pearly
gates
and
them
little
angels
with
nothing
on
only
their
heads
and
wings
so
cheap
to
dress
i
always
think
compared
with
children
when
she
was
got
rid
of
mabel
ate
the
bread
and
drank
water
from
the
i
afraid
it
tastes
of
cherry
rather
said
kathleen
apologetically
it
does
matter
a
voice
replied
from
the
tilted
mug
it
more
interesting
than
water
i
should
think
red
wine
in
ballads
was
rather
like
this
we
got
leave
for
the
day
again
said
kathleen
when
the
last
bit
of
bread
had
vanished
and
gerald
feels
like
i
do
about
lies
so
going
to
tell
your
aunt
where
you
really
are
she
wo
believe
you
that
does
matter
if
we
speak
the
truth
said
kathleen
primly
i
expect
you
be
sorry
for
it
said
mabel
but
come
on
and
i
say
do
be
careful
not
to
shut
me
in
the
door
as
you
go
out
you
nearly
did
just
now
in
the
blazing
sunlight
that
flooded
the
high
street
four
shadows
to
three
children
seemed
dangerously
noticeable
a
butcher
boy
looked
far
too
earnestly
at
the
extra
shadow
and
his
big
lurcher
snuffed
at
the
legs
of
that
shadow
mistress
and
whined
uncomfortably
get
behind
me
said
kathleen
then
our
two
shadows
will
look
like
one
but
mabel
shadow
very
visible
fell
on
kathleen
back
and
the
ostler
of
the
davenant
arms
looked
up
to
see
what
big
bird
had
cast
that
big
shadow
a
woman
driving
a
cart
with
chickens
and
ducks
in
it
called
out
halloa
missy
ai
you
blacked
yer
back
neither
what
you
been
leaning
up
against
every
one
was
glad
when
they
got
out
of
the
town
speaking
the
truth
to
mabel
aunt
did
not
turn
out
at
all
as
any
one
even
mabel
expected
the
aunt
was
discovered
reading
a
pink
novelette
at
the
window
of
the
housekeeper
room
which
framed
in
clematis
and
green
creepers
looked
out
on
a
nice
little
courtyard
to
which
mabel
led
the
party
excuse
me
said
gerald
but
i
believe
you
lost
your
niece
not
lost
my
boy
said
the
aunt
who
was
spare
and
tall
with
a
drab
fringe
and
a
very
genteel
voice
we
could
tell
you
something
about
her
said
gerald
illustration
halloa
missy
ai
you
blacked
yer
back
neither
now
replied
the
aunt
in
a
warning
voice
no
complaints
please
my
niece
has
gone
and
i
am
sure
no
one
thinks
less
than
i
do
of
her
little
pranks
if
she
played
any
tricks
on
you
it
only
her
way
go
away
children
i
busy
did
you
get
her
note
asked
kathleen
the
aunt
showed
rather
more
interest
than
before
but
she
still
kept
her
finger
in
the
novelette
oh
she
said
so
you
witnessed
her
departure
did
she
seem
glad
to
go
quite
said
gerald
truthfully
then
i
can
only
be
glad
that
she
is
provided
for
said
the
aunt
i
dare
say
you
were
surprised
these
romantic
adventures
do
occur
in
our
family
lord
yalding
selected
me
out
of
eleven
applicants
for
the
post
of
housekeeper
here
i
not
the
slightest
doubt
the
child
was
changed
at
birth
and
her
rich
relatives
have
claimed
her
but
are
you
going
to
do
anything
tell
the
police
or
shish
said
mabel
wo
shish
said
jimmy
your
mabel
invisible
that
all
it
is
she
just
beside
me
now
i
detest
untruthfulness
said
the
aunt
severely
in
all
its
forms
will
you
kindly
take
that
little
boy
away
i
am
quite
satisfied
about
mabel
said
gerald
you
an
aunt
and
no
mistake
but
what
will
mabel
father
and
mother
say
mabel
father
and
mother
are
dead
said
the
aunt
calmly
and
a
little
sob
sounded
close
to
gerald
ear
all
right
he
said
we
be
off
but
do
you
go
saying
we
tell
you
the
truth
that
all
you
have
told
me
nothing
said
the
aunt
none
of
you
except
that
little
boy
who
has
told
me
a
silly
falsehood
we
meant
well
said
gerald
gently
you
do
mind
our
having
come
through
the
grounds
do
you
we
very
careful
not
to
touch
anything
no
visitors
are
allowed
said
the
aunt
glancing
down
at
her
novel
rather
impatiently
ah
but
you
would
count
visitors
said
gerald
in
his
best
manner
we
friends
of
mabel
our
father
colonel
of
the
th
indeed
said
the
aunt
and
our
aunt
lady
sandling
so
you
can
be
sure
we
would
hurt
anything
on
the
estate
i
sure
you
would
hurt
a
fly
said
the
aunt
absently
goodbye
be
good
children
and
on
this
they
got
away
quickly
why
said
gerald
when
they
were
outside
the
little
court
your
aunt
as
mad
as
a
hatter
fancy
not
caring
what
becomes
of
you
and
fancy
believing
that
rot
about
the
motor
lady
i
knew
she
believe
it
when
i
wrote
it
said
mabel
modestly
not
mad
only
she
always
reading
novelettes
read
the
books
in
the
big
library
oh
it
such
a
jolly
room
such
a
queer
smell
like
boots
and
old
leather
books
sort
of
powdery
at
the
edges
i
take
you
there
some
day
now
your
consciences
are
all
right
about
my
aunt
i
tell
you
my
great
idea
let
get
down
to
the
temple
of
flora
i
glad
you
got
aunt
permission
for
the
grounds
it
would
be
so
awkward
for
you
to
have
to
be
always
dodging
behind
bushes
when
one
of
the
gardeners
came
along
yes
said
gerald
modestly
i
thought
of
that
the
day
was
as
bright
as
yesterday
had
been
and
from
the
white
marble
temple
the
landscape
looked
more
than
ever
like
a
steel
engraving
coloured
by
hand
or
an
oleographic
imitation
of
one
of
turner
pictures
when
the
three
children
were
comfortably
settled
on
the
steps
that
led
up
to
the
white
statue
the
voice
of
the
fourth
child
said
sadly
not
ungrateful
but
i
rather
hungry
and
you
ca
be
always
taking
things
for
me
through
your
larder
window
if
you
like
i
go
back
and
live
in
the
castle
it
supposed
to
be
haunted
i
suppose
i
could
haunt
it
as
well
as
any
one
else
i
am
a
sort
of
ghost
now
you
know
i
will
if
you
like
oh
no
said
kathleen
kindly
you
must
stay
with
us
but
about
food
i
not
ungrateful
really
i
not
but
breakfast
is
breakfast
and
bread
only
bread
if
you
could
get
the
ring
off
you
could
go
back
yes
said
mabel
voice
but
you
see
i
ca
i
tried
again
last
night
in
bed
and
again
this
morning
and
it
like
stealing
taking
things
out
of
your
larder
even
if
it
only
bread
yes
it
is
said
gerald
who
had
carried
out
this
bold
enterprise
well
now
what
we
must
do
is
to
earn
some
money
jimmy
remarked
that
this
was
all
very
well
but
gerald
and
kathleen
listened
attentively
what
i
mean
to
say
the
voice
went
on
i
really
sure
is
all
for
the
best
me
being
invisible
we
shall
have
adventures
you
see
if
we
do
said
the
bold
buccaneer
not
always
profitable
it
was
gerald
who
murmured
this
this
one
will
be
anyhow
you
see
only
you
must
all
go
look
here
if
jerry
could
make
himself
look
common
that
ought
to
be
easy
said
jimmy
and
kathleen
told
him
not
to
be
so
jolly
disagreeable
i
not
said
jimmy
only
only
he
has
an
inside
feeling
that
this
mabel
of
yours
is
going
to
get
us
into
trouble
put
in
gerald
like
la
belle
dame
sans
merci
and
he
does
not
want
to
be
found
in
future
ages
alone
and
palely
loitering
in
the
middle
of
sedge
and
things
i
wo
get
you
into
trouble
indeed
i
wo
said
the
voice
why
we
a
band
of
brothers
for
life
after
the
way
you
stood
by
me
yesterday
what
i
mean
is
gerald
can
go
to
the
fair
and
do
conjuring
he
does
know
any
said
kathleen
should
do
it
really
said
mabel
but
jerry
could
look
like
doing
it
move
things
without
touching
them
and
all
that
but
it
would
do
for
all
three
of
you
to
go
the
more
there
are
of
children
the
younger
they
look
i
think
and
the
more
people
wonder
what
they
doing
all
alone
by
themselves
the
accomplished
conjurer
deemed
these
the
words
of
wisdom
said
gerald
and
answered
the
dismal
well
but
what
about
us
of
his
brother
and
sister
by
suggesting
that
they
should
mingle
unsuspected
with
the
crowd
but
do
let
on
that
you
know
me
he
said
and
try
to
look
as
if
you
belonged
to
some
of
the
at
the
fair
if
you
do
as
likely
as
not
you
have
the
kind
policemen
taking
the
little
lost
children
by
the
hand
and
leading
them
home
to
their
stricken
relations
french
governess
i
mean
let
go
said
the
voice
that
they
never
could
get
quite
used
to
hearing
coming
out
of
different
parts
of
the
air
as
mabel
moved
from
one
place
to
another
so
they
went
the
fair
was
held
on
a
waste
bit
of
land
about
half
a
mile
from
the
castle
gates
when
they
got
near
enough
to
hear
the
of
the
gerald
suggested
that
as
he
had
ninepence
he
should
go
ahead
and
get
something
to
eat
the
amount
spent
to
be
paid
back
out
of
any
money
they
might
make
by
conjuring
the
others
waited
in
the
shadows
of
a
lane
and
he
came
back
quite
soon
though
long
after
they
had
begun
to
say
what
a
long
time
he
had
been
gone
he
brought
some
barcelona
nuts
apples
small
sweet
yellow
pears
pale
pasty
gingerbread
a
whole
quarter
of
a
pound
of
peppermint
and
two
bottles
of
gingerbeer
it
what
they
call
an
investment
he
said
when
kathleen
said
something
about
extravagance
we
shall
all
need
special
nourishing
to
keep
our
strength
up
especially
the
bold
conjurer
they
ate
and
drank
it
was
a
very
beautiful
meal
and
the
music
of
the
added
the
last
touch
of
festivity
to
the
scene
the
boys
were
never
tired
of
seeing
mabel
eat
or
rather
of
seeing
the
strange
vanishment
of
food
which
was
all
that
showed
of
mabel
eating
they
were
entranced
by
the
spectacle
and
pressed
on
her
more
than
her
just
share
of
the
feast
just
for
the
pleasure
of
seeing
it
disappear
my
aunt
said
gerald
again
and
again
that
ought
to
knock
it
did
jimmy
and
kathleen
had
the
start
of
the
others
and
when
they
got
to
the
fair
they
mingled
with
the
crowd
and
were
as
unsuspected
as
possible
they
stood
near
a
large
lady
who
was
watching
the
cocoanut
shies
and
presently
saw
a
strange
figure
with
its
hands
in
its
pockets
strolling
across
the
trampled
yellowy
grass
among
the
bits
of
drifting
paper
and
the
sticks
and
straws
that
always
litter
the
ground
of
an
english
fair
it
was
gerald
but
at
first
they
hardly
knew
him
he
had
taken
off
his
tie
and
round
his
head
arranged
like
a
turban
was
the
crimson
that
had
supported
his
white
flannels
the
tie
one
supposed
had
taken
on
the
duties
of
the
handkerchief
and
his
face
and
hands
were
a
bright
black
like
very
nicely
polished
stoves
every
one
turned
to
look
at
him
he
just
like
a
nigger
whispered
jimmy
i
do
suppose
it
ever
come
off
do
you
they
followed
him
at
a
distance
and
when
he
went
close
to
the
door
of
a
small
tent
against
whose
a
melancholy
woman
was
lounging
they
stopped
and
tried
to
look
as
though
they
belonged
to
a
farmer
who
strove
to
send
up
a
number
by
banging
with
a
big
mallet
on
a
wooden
block
gerald
went
up
to
the
woman
taken
much
he
asked
and
was
told
but
not
harshly
to
go
away
with
his
impudence
i
in
business
myself
said
gerald
i
a
conjurer
from
india
not
you
said
the
woman
you
ai
no
nigger
why
the
backs
of
yer
ears
is
all
white
are
they
said
gerald
how
clever
of
you
to
see
that
he
rubbed
them
with
his
hands
that
better
that
all
right
what
your
little
game
conjuring
really
and
truly
said
gerald
there
smaller
boys
than
me
put
on
to
it
in
india
look
here
i
owe
you
one
for
telling
me
about
my
ears
if
you
like
to
run
the
show
for
me
i
go
shares
let
me
have
your
tent
to
perform
in
and
you
do
the
patter
at
the
door
lor
love
you
i
ca
do
no
patter
and
you
getting
at
me
see
you
do
a
bit
of
conjuring
since
you
so
clever
an
all
right
you
are
said
gerald
firmly
you
see
this
apple
well
make
it
move
slowly
through
the
air
and
then
when
i
say
vanish
yes
into
your
mouth
get
away
with
your
nonsense
you
too
clever
to
be
so
unbelieving
said
gerald
look
here
he
held
out
one
of
the
little
apples
and
the
woman
saw
it
move
slowly
and
unsupported
along
the
air
now
cried
gerald
to
the
apple
and
it
went
how
that
he
asked
in
tones
of
triumph
the
woman
was
glowing
with
excitement
and
her
eyes
shone
the
best
i
ever
see
she
whispered
i
on
mate
if
you
know
any
more
tricks
like
that
heaps
said
gerald
confidently
hold
out
your
hand
the
woman
held
it
out
and
from
nowhere
as
it
seemed
the
apple
appeared
and
was
laid
on
her
hand
the
apple
was
rather
damp
illustration
you
getting
at
me
let
see
you
do
a
bit
of
conjuring
since
you
so
clever
an
all
she
looked
at
it
a
moment
and
then
whispered
come
on
there
to
be
no
one
in
it
but
just
us
two
but
not
in
the
tent
you
take
a
pitch
here
the
tent
it
worth
twice
the
money
in
the
open
air
but
people
wo
pay
if
they
can
see
it
all
for
nothing
not
for
the
first
turn
but
they
will
after
you
see
and
you
have
to
do
the
patter
will
you
lend
me
your
shawl
gerald
asked
she
unpinned
it
it
was
a
red
and
black
plaid
and
he
spread
it
on
the
ground
as
he
had
seen
indian
conjurers
do
and
seated
himself
behind
it
i
must
have
any
one
behind
me
that
all
he
said
and
the
woman
hastily
screened
off
a
little
enclosure
for
him
by
hanging
old
sacks
to
two
of
the
of
the
tent
now
i
ready
he
said
the
woman
got
a
drum
from
the
inside
of
the
tent
and
beat
it
quite
soon
a
little
crowd
had
collected
ladies
and
gentlemen
said
gerald
i
come
from
india
and
i
can
do
a
conjuring
entertainment
the
like
of
which
you
never
seen
when
i
see
two
shillings
on
the
shawl
i
begin
i
dare
say
you
will
said
a
bystander
and
there
were
several
short
disagreeable
laughs
of
course
said
gerald
if
you
ca
afford
two
shillings
between
you
there
were
about
thirty
people
in
the
crowd
by
now
i
say
no
more
two
or
three
pennies
fell
on
the
shawl
then
a
few
more
then
the
fall
of
copper
ceased
ninepence
said
gerald
well
i
got
a
generous
nature
you
get
such
a
as
you
never
had
before
i
do
wish
to
deceive
you
i
have
an
accomplice
but
my
accomplice
is
invisible
the
crowd
snorted
by
the
aid
of
that
accomplice
gerald
went
on
i
will
read
any
letter
that
any
of
you
may
have
in
your
pocket
if
one
of
you
will
just
step
over
the
rope
and
stand
beside
me
my
invisible
accomplice
will
read
that
letter
over
his
shoulder
a
man
stepped
forward
a
person
he
pulled
a
letter
from
his
pocket
and
stood
plain
in
the
sight
of
all
in
a
place
where
every
one
saw
that
no
one
could
see
over
his
shoulder
now
said
gerald
there
was
a
moment
pause
then
from
quite
the
other
side
of
the
enclosure
came
a
faint
voice
it
said
yours
of
the
fifteenth
duly
to
hand
with
regard
to
the
mortgage
on
your
land
we
regret
our
inability
stow
it
cried
the
man
turning
threateningly
on
gerald
he
stepped
out
of
the
enclosure
explaining
that
there
was
nothing
of
that
sort
in
his
letter
but
nobody
believed
him
and
a
buzz
of
interested
chatter
began
in
the
crowd
ceasing
abruptly
when
gerald
began
to
speak
now
said
he
laying
the
nine
pennies
down
on
the
shawl
you
keep
your
eyes
on
those
pennies
and
one
by
one
you
see
them
disappear
illustration
stow
it
cried
the
man
turning
threateningly
on
gerald
and
of
course
they
did
then
one
by
one
they
were
laid
down
again
by
the
invisible
hand
of
mabel
the
crowd
clapped
loudly
brayvo
something
like
show
us
another
cried
the
people
in
the
front
rank
and
those
behind
pushed
forward
now
said
gerald
you
seen
what
i
can
do
but
i
do
do
any
more
till
i
see
five
shillings
on
this
carpet
and
in
two
minutes
lay
there
and
gerald
did
a
little
more
conjuring
when
the
people
in
front
did
want
to
give
any
more
money
gerald
asked
them
to
stand
back
and
let
the
others
have
a
look
in
i
wish
i
had
time
to
tell
you
of
all
the
tricks
he
did
the
grass
round
his
enclosure
was
absolutely
trampled
off
by
the
feet
of
the
people
who
thronged
to
look
at
him
there
is
really
hardly
any
limit
to
the
wonders
you
can
do
if
you
have
an
invisible
accomplice
all
sorts
of
things
were
made
to
move
about
apparently
by
themselves
and
even
to
vanish
into
the
folds
of
mabel
clothing
the
woman
stood
by
looking
more
and
more
pleasant
as
she
saw
the
money
come
tumbling
in
and
beating
her
shabby
drum
every
time
gerald
stopped
conjuring
the
news
of
the
conjurer
had
spread
all
over
the
fair
the
crowd
was
frantic
with
admiration
the
man
who
ran
the
cocoanut
shies
begged
gerald
to
throw
in
his
lot
with
him
the
owner
of
the
rifle
gallery
offered
him
free
board
and
lodging
and
go
shares
and
a
brisk
broad
lady
in
stiff
black
silk
and
a
violet
bonnet
tried
to
engage
him
for
the
forthcoming
bazaar
for
reformed
bandsmen
and
all
this
time
the
others
mingled
with
the
crowd
quite
unobserved
for
who
could
have
eyes
for
any
one
but
gerald
it
was
getting
quite
late
long
past
and
gerald
who
was
getting
very
tired
indeed
and
was
quite
satisfied
with
his
share
of
the
money
was
racking
his
brains
for
a
way
to
get
out
of
it
how
are
we
to
hook
it
he
murmured
as
mabel
made
his
cap
disappear
from
his
head
by
the
simple
process
of
taking
it
off
and
putting
it
in
her
pocket
they
never
let
us
get
away
i
did
think
of
that
before
let
me
think
whispered
mabel
and
next
moment
she
said
close
to
his
ear
divide
the
money
and
give
her
something
for
the
shawl
put
the
money
on
it
and
say
she
told
him
what
to
say
gerald
pitch
was
in
the
shade
of
the
tent
otherwise
of
course
every
one
would
have
seen
the
shadow
of
the
invisible
mabel
as
she
moved
about
making
things
vanish
gerald
told
the
woman
to
divide
the
money
which
she
did
honestly
enough
now
he
said
while
the
impatient
crowd
pressed
closer
and
closer
i
give
you
five
bob
for
your
shawl
said
the
woman
mechanically
righto
said
gerald
putting
his
heavy
share
of
the
money
in
his
trouser
pocket
this
shawl
will
now
disappear
he
said
picking
it
up
he
handed
it
to
mabel
who
put
it
on
and
of
course
it
disappeared
a
roar
of
applause
went
up
from
the
audience
now
he
said
i
come
to
the
last
trick
of
all
i
shall
take
three
steps
backward
and
vanish
he
took
three
steps
backward
mabel
wrapped
the
invisible
shawl
round
him
and
he
did
not
vanish
the
shawl
being
invisible
did
not
conceal
him
in
the
least
yah
cried
a
boy
voice
in
the
crowd
look
at
knows
do
it
i
wish
i
could
put
you
in
my
pocket
said
mabel
the
crowd
was
crowding
closer
at
any
moment
they
might
touch
mabel
and
then
anything
might
happen
simply
anything
gerald
took
hold
of
his
hair
with
both
hands
as
his
way
was
when
he
was
anxious
or
discouraged
mabel
in
invisibility
wrung
her
hands
as
people
are
said
to
do
in
books
that
is
she
clasped
them
and
squeezed
very
tight
oh
she
whispered
suddenly
it
loose
i
can
get
it
off
not
yes
the
ring
come
on
young
master
give
us
summat
for
our
money
a
farm
labourer
shouted
i
will
said
gerald
this
time
i
really
will
vanish
slip
round
into
the
tent
he
whispered
to
mabel
push
the
ring
under
the
canvas
then
slip
out
at
the
back
and
join
the
others
when
i
see
you
with
them
disappear
go
slow
and
i
catch
you
up
it
me
said
a
pale
and
obvious
mabel
in
the
ear
of
kathleen
got
the
ring
come
on
before
the
crowd
begins
to
scatter
as
they
went
out
of
the
gate
they
heard
a
roar
of
surprise
and
annoyance
rise
from
the
crowd
and
knew
that
this
time
gerald
really
disappeared
they
had
gone
a
mile
before
they
heard
footsteps
on
the
road
and
looked
back
no
one
was
to
be
seen
next
moment
gerald
voice
spoke
out
of
clear
space
halloa
it
said
gloomily
how
horrid
cried
mabel
you
did
make
me
jump
take
the
ring
off
it
makes
me
feel
quite
creepy
you
being
nothing
but
a
voice
so
did
you
us
said
jimmy
do
take
it
off
yet
said
kathleen
who
was
really
rather
thoughtful
for
her
age
because
you
still
black
i
suppose
and
you
might
be
recognised
and
eloped
with
by
gipsies
so
that
you
should
go
on
doing
conjuring
for
ever
and
ever
i
should
take
it
off
said
jimmy
it
no
use
going
about
invisible
and
people
seeing
us
with
mabel
and
saying
we
eloped
with
her
yes
said
mabel
impatiently
that
would
be
simply
silly
and
besides
i
want
my
ring
it
not
yours
any
more
than
ours
anyhow
said
jimmy
yes
it
is
said
mabel
oh
stow
it
said
the
weary
voice
of
gerald
beside
her
what
the
use
of
jawing
i
want
the
ring
said
mabel
rather
mulishly
want
the
words
came
out
of
the
still
evening
air
want
must
be
your
master
you
ca
have
the
ring
ca
get
it
off
chapter
iv
the
difficulty
was
not
only
that
gerald
had
got
the
ring
on
and
get
it
off
and
was
therefore
invisible
but
that
mabel
who
had
been
invisible
and
therefore
possible
to
be
smuggled
into
the
house
was
now
plain
to
be
seen
and
impossible
for
smuggling
purposes
the
children
would
have
not
only
to
account
for
the
apparent
absence
of
one
of
themselves
but
for
the
obvious
presence
of
a
perfect
stranger
i
ca
go
back
to
aunt
i
ca
and
i
wo
said
mabel
firmly
not
if
i
was
visible
twenty
times
over
she
smell
a
rat
if
you
did
gerald
owned
about
the
i
mean
and
the
adopting
lady
and
what
we
to
say
to
mademoiselle
about
you
he
tugged
at
the
ring
suppose
you
told
the
truth
said
mabel
meaningly
she
would
believe
it
said
cathy
or
if
she
did
she
go
stark
staring
raving
mad
no
said
gerald
voice
we
dare
her
but
she
really
rather
decent
let
ask
her
to
let
you
stay
the
night
because
it
too
late
for
you
to
get
home
that
all
right
said
jimmy
but
what
about
you
i
shall
go
to
bed
said
gerald
with
a
bad
headache
oh
not
a
lie
i
got
one
right
enough
it
the
sun
i
think
i
know
blacklead
attracts
the
concentration
of
the
sun
more
likely
the
pears
and
the
gingerbread
said
jimmy
unkindly
well
let
get
along
i
wish
it
was
me
was
invisible
i
do
something
different
from
going
to
bed
with
a
silly
headache
i
know
that
what
would
you
do
asked
the
voice
of
gerald
just
behind
him
do
keep
in
one
place
you
silly
cuckoo
said
jimmy
you
make
me
feel
all
jumpy
he
had
indeed
jumped
rather
violently
here
walk
between
cathy
and
me
what
you
do
repeated
gerald
from
that
apparently
unoccupied
position
i
be
a
burglar
said
jimmy
cathy
and
mabel
in
one
breath
reminded
him
how
wrong
burgling
was
and
jimmy
replied
well
then
a
detective
there
got
to
be
something
to
detect
before
you
can
begin
detectiving
said
mabel
detectives
do
always
detect
things
said
jimmy
very
truly
if
i
could
be
any
other
kind
i
be
a
baffled
detective
you
could
be
one
all
right
and
have
no
end
of
larks
just
the
same
why
do
you
do
it
it
exactly
what
i
going
to
do
said
gerald
we
go
round
by
the
and
see
what
they
got
in
the
way
of
crimes
they
did
and
read
the
notices
on
the
board
outside
two
dogs
had
been
lost
a
purse
and
a
portfolio
of
papers
of
no
value
to
any
but
the
owner
also
houghton
grange
had
been
broken
into
and
a
quantity
of
silver
plate
stolen
twenty
pounds
reward
offered
for
any
information
that
may
lead
to
the
recovery
of
the
missing
property
that
burglary
my
lay
said
gerald
i
detect
that
here
comes
johnson
he
added
he
going
off
duty
ask
him
about
it
the
fell
detective
being
invisible
was
unable
to
pump
the
constable
but
the
young
brother
of
our
hero
made
the
inquiries
in
quite
a
creditable
manner
be
creditable
jimmy
jimmy
hailed
the
constable
halloa
johnson
he
said
and
johnson
replied
halloa
young
shaver
shaver
yourself
said
jimmy
but
without
malice
what
are
you
doing
this
time
of
night
the
constable
asked
jocosely
all
the
dicky
birds
is
gone
to
their
little
nesteses
we
been
to
the
fair
said
kathleen
there
was
a
conjurer
there
i
wish
you
could
have
seen
him
heard
about
him
said
johnson
all
fake
you
know
the
quickness
of
the
deceives
the
hi
such
is
fame
gerald
standing
in
the
shadow
jingled
the
loose
money
in
his
pocket
to
console
himself
what
that
the
policeman
asked
quickly
illustration
what
that
the
policeman
asked
quickly
our
money
jingling
said
jimmy
with
perfect
truth
it
well
to
be
some
people
johnson
remarked
wish
i
got
my
pockets
full
to
jingle
with
well
why
have
you
asked
mabel
why
do
you
get
that
twenty
pounds
reward
i
tell
you
why
i
do
because
in
this
realm
of
liberty
and
britannia
ruling
the
waves
you
aint
allowed
to
arrest
a
chap
on
suspicion
even
if
you
know
puffickly
well
who
done
the
job
what
a
shame
said
jimmy
warmly
and
who
you
think
did
it
i
do
think
i
know
johnson
voice
was
ponderous
as
his
boots
it
a
man
what
known
to
the
police
on
account
of
a
heap
o
crimes
he
done
but
we
never
ca
bring
it
to
nor
yet
get
sufficient
evidence
to
convict
well
said
jimmy
when
i
left
school
i
come
to
you
and
be
apprenticed
and
be
a
detective
just
now
i
think
we
better
get
home
and
detect
our
supper
they
watched
the
policeman
broad
form
disappear
through
the
swing
door
of
the
and
as
it
settled
itself
into
quiet
again
the
voice
of
gerald
was
heard
complaining
bitterly
you
no
more
brains
than
a
halfpenny
bun
he
said
no
details
about
how
and
when
the
silver
was
taken
but
he
told
us
he
knew
jimmy
urged
yes
that
all
you
got
out
of
him
a
silly
policeman
silly
idea
go
home
and
detect
your
precious
supper
it
all
you
fit
for
what
you
do
about
supper
mabel
asked
buns
said
gerald
halfpenny
buns
they
make
me
think
of
my
dear
little
brother
and
sister
perhaps
you
got
enough
sense
to
buy
buns
i
ca
go
into
a
shop
in
this
state
do
you
be
so
disagreeable
said
mabel
with
spirit
we
did
our
best
if
i
were
cathy
you
should
whistle
for
your
nasty
buns
if
you
were
cathy
the
gallant
young
detective
would
have
left
home
long
ago
better
the
cabin
of
a
tramp
steamer
than
the
best
family
mansion
that
got
a
brawling
sister
in
it
said
gerald
you
a
bit
of
an
outsider
at
present
my
gentle
maiden
jimmy
and
cathy
know
well
enough
when
their
bold
leader
is
chaffing
and
when
he
is
not
when
we
ca
see
your
face
we
do
said
cathy
in
tones
of
relief
i
really
thought
you
were
in
a
flaring
wax
and
so
did
jimmy
did
you
oh
rot
said
gerald
come
on
this
way
to
the
bun
shop
they
went
and
it
was
while
cathy
and
jimmy
were
in
the
shop
and
the
others
were
gazing
through
the
glass
at
the
jam
tarts
and
swiss
rolls
and
victoria
sandwiches
and
bath
buns
under
the
spread
yellow
muslin
in
the
window
that
gerald
discoursed
in
mabel
ear
of
the
plans
and
hopes
of
one
entering
on
a
detective
career
i
shall
keep
my
eyes
open
i
can
tell
you
he
began
i
shall
keep
my
eyes
skinned
and
no
jolly
error
the
invisible
detective
may
not
only
find
out
about
the
purse
and
the
silver
but
detect
some
crime
that
is
even
done
yet
and
i
shall
hang
about
until
i
see
some
characters
leave
the
town
and
follow
them
furtively
and
catch
them
with
their
hands
full
of
priceless
jewels
and
hand
them
over
oh
cried
mabel
so
sharply
and
suddenly
that
gerald
was
roused
from
his
dream
to
express
sympathy
pain
he
said
quite
kindly
it
the
apples
they
rather
hard
oh
it
not
that
said
mabel
very
earnestly
oh
how
awful
i
never
thought
of
that
before
never
thought
of
gerald
asked
impatiently
the
window
what
window
the
window
at
home
you
know
at
the
castle
that
settles
it
i
go
home
we
left
it
open
and
the
shutters
as
well
and
all
the
jewels
and
things
there
auntie
never
go
in
she
never
does
that
settles
it
i
go
home
now
this
minute
here
the
others
issued
from
the
shop
and
the
situation
was
hastily
explained
to
them
illustration
i
go
home
now
this
minute
so
you
see
i
must
go
mabel
ended
and
kathleen
agreed
that
she
must
but
jimmy
said
he
did
see
what
good
it
would
do
because
the
inside
the
door
anyhow
she
be
cross
said
mabel
sadly
she
have
to
get
the
gardeners
to
get
a
ladder
and
hooray
said
gerald
here
me
nobler
and
more
secret
than
gardeners
or
ladders
was
the
invisible
jerry
i
climb
in
at
the
window
all
ivy
i
know
i
could
and
shut
the
window
and
the
shutters
all
sereno
put
the
key
back
on
the
nail
and
slip
out
unperceived
the
back
way
threading
my
way
through
the
maze
of
unconscious
retainers
there
be
plenty
of
time
i
do
suppose
burglars
begin
their
fell
work
until
the
night
is
far
advanced
wo
you
be
afraid
mabel
asked
will
it
be
safe
suppose
you
were
caught
as
houses
i
ca
be
gerald
answered
and
wondered
that
the
question
came
from
mabel
and
not
from
kathleen
who
was
usually
inclined
to
fuss
a
little
annoyingly
about
the
danger
and
folly
of
adventures
but
all
kathleen
said
was
well
goodbye
we
come
and
see
you
mabel
the
floral
temple
at
ten
i
hope
you
get
into
an
awful
row
about
the
lady
let
detect
our
supper
now
said
jimmy
all
right
said
gerald
a
little
bitterly
it
is
hard
to
enter
on
an
adventure
like
this
and
to
find
the
sympathetic
interest
of
years
suddenly
cut
off
at
the
meter
as
it
were
gerald
felt
that
he
ought
at
a
time
like
this
to
have
been
the
centre
of
interest
and
he
was
they
could
actually
talk
about
supper
well
let
them
he
did
care
he
spoke
with
sharp
sternness
leave
the
pantry
window
undone
for
me
to
get
in
by
when
i
done
my
detecting
come
on
mabel
he
caught
her
hand
bags
i
the
buns
though
he
added
by
a
happy
afterthought
and
snatching
the
bag
pressed
it
on
mabel
and
the
sound
of
four
boots
echoed
on
the
pavement
of
the
high
street
as
the
outlines
of
the
running
mabel
grew
small
with
distance
mademoiselle
was
in
the
she
was
sitting
by
the
window
in
the
waning
light
reading
letters
ah
she
said
unintelligibly
you
are
again
late
and
my
little
gerald
where
is
he
this
was
an
awful
moment
jimmy
detective
scheme
had
not
included
any
answer
to
this
inevitable
question
the
silence
was
unbroken
till
jimmy
spoke
he
he
was
going
to
bed
because
he
had
a
headache
and
this
of
course
was
true
this
poor
gerald
said
mademoiselle
is
it
that
i
should
mount
him
some
supper
he
never
eats
anything
when
he
got
one
of
his
headaches
kathleen
said
and
this
also
was
the
truth
jimmy
and
kathleen
went
to
bed
wholly
untroubled
by
anxiety
about
their
brother
and
mademoiselle
pulled
out
the
bundle
of
letters
and
read
them
amid
the
ruins
of
the
simple
supper
it
is
ripping
being
out
late
like
this
said
gerald
through
the
soft
summer
dusk
yes
said
mabel
a
figure
plodding
along
the
i
do
hope
auntie
wo
be
furious
have
another
bun
suggested
gerald
kindly
and
a
sociable
munching
followed
it
was
the
aunt
herself
who
opened
to
a
very
pale
and
trembling
mabel
the
door
which
is
appointed
for
the
entrances
and
exits
of
the
domestic
staff
at
yalding
towers
she
looked
over
mabel
head
first
as
if
she
expected
to
see
some
one
taller
then
a
very
small
voice
said
aunt
the
aunt
started
back
then
made
a
step
towards
mabel
you
naughty
naughty
girl
she
cried
angrily
how
could
you
give
me
such
a
fright
i
a
good
mind
to
keep
you
in
bed
for
a
week
for
this
miss
oh
mabel
thank
heaven
you
safe
and
with
that
the
arms
went
round
mabel
and
mabel
round
the
aunt
in
such
a
hug
as
they
had
never
met
in
before
but
you
did
seem
to
care
a
bit
this
morning
said
mabel
when
she
had
realised
that
her
aunt
really
had
been
anxious
really
was
glad
to
have
her
safe
home
again
how
do
you
know
i
was
there
listening
do
be
angry
auntie
i
feel
as
if
i
never
could
be
angry
with
you
again
now
i
got
you
safe
said
the
aunt
surprisingly
but
how
was
it
mabel
asked
my
dear
said
the
aunt
impressively
i
been
in
a
sort
of
trance
i
think
i
must
be
going
to
be
ill
i
always
been
fond
of
you
but
i
did
want
to
spoil
you
but
yesterday
about
three
i
was
talking
about
you
to
lewson
at
the
fair
and
quite
suddenly
i
felt
as
if
you
did
matter
at
all
and
i
felt
the
same
when
i
got
your
letter
and
when
those
children
came
and
in
the
middle
of
tea
i
suddenly
woke
up
and
realised
that
you
were
gone
it
was
awful
i
think
i
must
be
going
to
be
oh
mabel
why
did
you
do
it
it
was
a
joke
said
mabel
feebly
and
then
the
two
went
in
and
the
door
was
shut
that
most
uncommon
odd
said
gerald
outside
looks
like
more
magic
to
me
i
do
feel
as
if
we
got
to
the
bottom
of
this
yet
by
any
manner
of
means
there
more
about
this
castle
than
meets
the
eye
there
certainly
was
for
this
castle
happened
to
be
but
it
would
not
be
fair
to
gerald
to
tell
you
more
about
it
than
he
knew
on
that
night
when
he
went
alone
and
invisible
through
the
shadowy
great
grounds
of
it
to
look
for
the
open
window
of
the
panelled
room
he
knew
that
night
no
more
than
i
have
told
you
but
as
he
went
along
the
dewy
lawns
and
through
the
groups
of
shrubs
and
trees
where
pools
lay
like
giant
reflecting
the
quiet
stars
and
the
white
limbs
of
statues
gleamed
against
a
background
of
shadow
he
began
to
feel
well
not
excited
not
surprised
not
anxious
but
different
the
incident
of
the
invisible
princess
had
surprised
the
incident
of
the
conjuring
had
excited
and
the
sudden
decision
to
be
a
detective
had
brought
its
own
anxieties
but
all
these
happenings
though
wonderful
and
unusual
had
seemed
to
be
after
all
inside
the
circle
of
possible
things
wonderful
as
the
chemical
experiments
are
where
two
liquids
poured
together
make
fire
surprising
as
legerdemain
thrilling
as
a
juggler
display
but
nothing
more
only
now
a
new
feeling
came
to
him
as
he
walked
through
those
gardens
by
day
those
gardens
were
like
dreams
at
night
they
were
like
visions
he
could
not
see
his
feet
as
he
walked
but
he
saw
the
movement
of
the
dewy
that
his
feet
displaced
and
he
had
that
extraordinary
feeling
so
difficult
to
describe
and
yet
so
real
and
so
unforgettable
the
feeling
that
he
was
in
another
world
that
had
covered
up
and
hidden
the
old
world
as
a
carpet
covers
a
floor
the
floor
was
there
all
right
underneath
but
what
he
walked
on
was
the
carpet
that
covered
it
and
that
carpet
was
drenched
in
magic
as
the
turf
was
drenched
in
dew
the
feeling
was
very
wonderful
perhaps
you
will
feel
it
some
day
there
are
still
some
places
in
the
world
where
it
can
be
felt
but
they
grow
fewer
every
year
the
enchantment
of
the
garden
held
him
i
not
go
in
yet
he
told
himself
it
too
early
and
perhaps
i
shall
never
be
here
at
night
again
i
suppose
it
the
night
that
makes
everything
look
so
different
something
white
moved
under
a
weeping
willow
white
hands
parted
the
long
rustling
leaves
a
white
figure
came
out
a
creature
with
horns
and
goat
legs
and
the
head
and
arms
of
a
boy
and
gerald
was
not
afraid
that
was
the
most
wonderful
thing
of
all
though
he
would
never
have
owned
it
the
white
thing
stretched
its
limbs
rolled
on
the
grass
righted
itself
and
frisked
away
across
the
lawn
still
something
white
gleamed
under
the
willow
three
steps
nearer
and
gerald
saw
that
it
was
the
pedestal
of
a
statue
empty
they
come
alive
he
said
and
another
white
shape
came
out
of
the
temple
of
flora
and
disappeared
in
the
laurels
the
statues
come
alive
illustration
the
moving
stone
beast
there
was
a
crunching
of
the
little
stones
in
the
gravel
of
the
drive
something
enormously
long
and
darkly
grey
came
crawling
towards
him
slowly
heavily
the
moon
came
out
just
in
time
to
show
its
shape
it
was
one
of
those
great
lizards
that
you
see
at
the
crystal
palace
made
in
stone
of
the
same
awful
size
which
they
were
millions
of
years
ago
when
they
were
masters
of
the
world
before
man
was
it
ca
see
me
said
gerald
i
am
not
afraid
come
to
life
too
as
it
writhed
past
him
he
reached
out
a
hand
and
touched
the
side
of
its
gigantic
tail
it
was
of
stone
it
had
not
come
alive
as
he
had
fancied
but
alive
in
its
stone
it
turned
however
at
the
touch
but
gerald
also
had
turned
and
was
running
with
all
his
speed
towards
the
house
because
at
that
stony
touch
fear
had
come
into
the
garden
and
almost
caught
him
it
was
fear
that
he
ran
from
and
not
the
moving
stone
beast
he
stood
panting
under
the
fifth
window
when
he
had
climbed
to
the
by
the
twisted
ivy
that
clung
to
the
wall
he
looked
back
over
the
grey
slope
there
was
a
splashing
at
the
that
had
mirrored
the
stars
the
shape
of
the
great
stone
beast
was
wallowing
in
the
shallows
among
the
once
inside
the
room
gerald
turned
for
another
look
the
lay
still
and
dark
reflecting
the
moon
through
a
gap
in
the
drooping
willow
the
moonlight
fell
on
a
statue
that
stood
calm
and
motionless
on
its
pedestal
everything
was
in
its
place
now
in
the
garden
nothing
moved
or
stirred
how
extraordinarily
rum
said
gerald
i
should
have
thought
you
go
to
sleep
walking
through
a
garden
and
dream
like
that
he
shut
the
window
lit
a
match
and
closed
the
shutters
another
match
showed
him
the
door
he
turned
the
key
went
out
locked
the
door
again
hung
the
key
on
its
usual
nail
and
crept
to
the
end
of
the
passage
here
he
waited
safe
in
his
invisibility
till
the
dazzle
of
the
matches
should
have
gone
from
his
eyes
and
he
be
once
more
able
to
find
his
way
by
the
moonlight
that
fell
in
bright
patches
on
the
floor
through
the
barred
unshuttered
windows
of
the
hall
wonder
where
the
kitchen
is
said
gerald
he
had
quite
forgotten
that
he
was
a
detective
he
was
only
anxious
to
get
home
and
tell
the
others
about
that
extraordinarily
odd
dream
that
he
had
had
in
the
gardens
i
suppose
it
does
matter
doors
i
open
i
invisible
all
right
still
i
suppose
yes
ca
see
my
hand
before
my
face
he
held
up
a
hand
for
the
purpose
here
goes
he
opened
many
doors
wandered
into
long
rooms
with
furniture
dressed
in
brown
holland
covers
that
looked
white
in
that
strange
light
rooms
with
chandeliers
hanging
in
big
bags
from
the
high
ceilings
rooms
whose
walls
were
alive
with
pictures
rooms
whose
walls
were
deadened
with
rows
on
rows
of
old
books
state
bedrooms
in
whose
great
plumed
queen
elizabeth
had
no
doubt
slept
that
queen
by
the
way
must
have
been
very
little
at
home
for
she
seems
to
have
slept
in
every
old
house
in
england
but
he
could
not
find
the
kitchen
at
last
a
door
opened
on
stone
steps
that
went
up
there
was
a
narrow
stone
passage
steps
that
went
down
a
door
with
a
light
under
it
it
was
somehow
difficult
to
put
out
one
hand
to
that
door
and
open
it
nonsense
gerald
told
himself
do
be
an
ass
are
you
invisible
or
are
you
then
he
opened
the
door
and
some
one
inside
said
something
in
a
sudden
rough
growl
gerald
stood
back
flattened
against
the
wall
as
a
man
sprang
to
the
doorway
and
flashed
a
lantern
into
the
passage
all
right
said
the
man
with
almost
a
sob
of
relief
it
was
only
the
door
swung
open
it
that
heavy
that
all
blow
the
door
said
another
growling
voice
blessed
if
i
did
think
it
was
a
fair
cop
that
time
they
closed
the
door
again
gerald
did
not
mind
in
fact
he
rather
preferred
that
it
should
be
so
he
did
like
the
look
of
those
men
there
was
an
air
of
threat
about
them
in
their
presence
even
invisibility
seemed
too
thin
a
disguise
and
gerald
had
seen
as
much
as
he
wanted
to
see
he
had
seen
that
he
had
been
right
about
the
gang
by
wonderful
luck
beginner
luck
a
would
have
told
him
he
had
discovered
a
burglary
on
the
very
first
night
of
his
detective
career
the
men
were
taking
silver
out
of
two
great
chests
wrapping
it
in
rags
and
packing
it
in
baize
sacks
the
door
of
the
room
was
of
iron
six
inches
thick
it
was
in
fact
the
and
these
men
had
picked
the
lock
the
tools
they
had
done
it
with
lay
on
the
floor
on
a
neat
cloth
roll
such
as
keep
their
chisels
in
hurry
up
gerald
heard
you
need
take
all
night
over
it
the
silver
rattled
slightly
you
a
rattling
of
them
trays
like
bloomin
castanets
said
the
gruffest
voice
gerald
turned
and
went
away
very
carefully
and
very
quickly
and
it
is
a
most
curious
thing
that
though
he
could
find
the
way
to
the
servants
wing
when
he
had
nothing
else
to
think
of
yet
now
with
his
mind
full
so
to
speak
of
silver
forks
and
silver
cups
and
the
question
of
who
might
be
coming
after
him
down
those
twisting
passages
he
went
straight
as
an
arrow
to
the
door
that
led
from
the
hall
to
the
place
he
wanted
to
get
to
as
he
went
the
happenings
took
words
in
his
mind
the
fortunate
detective
he
told
himself
having
succeeded
beyond
his
wildest
dreams
himself
left
the
spot
in
search
of
assistance
but
what
assistance
there
were
no
doubt
men
in
the
house
also
the
aunt
but
he
could
not
warn
them
he
was
too
hopelessly
invisible
to
carry
any
weight
with
strangers
the
assistance
of
mabel
would
not
be
of
much
value
the
police
before
they
could
be
got
and
the
getting
of
them
presented
difficulties
the
burglars
would
have
cleared
away
with
their
sacks
of
silver
illustration
the
men
were
taking
silver
out
of
two
great
chests
gerald
stopped
and
thought
hard
he
held
his
head
with
both
hands
to
do
it
you
know
the
way
the
same
as
you
sometimes
do
for
simple
equations
or
the
dates
of
the
battles
of
the
civil
war
then
with
pencil
a
and
all
the
cleverness
he
could
find
at
the
moment
he
wrote
know
the
room
where
the
silver
is
burglars
are
burgling
it
the
thick
door
is
picked
send
a
man
for
police
i
will
follow
the
burglars
if
they
get
away
ere
police
arrive
on
the
he
hesitated
a
moment
and
ended
a
friend
this
is
not
a
this
letter
tied
tightly
round
a
stone
by
means
of
a
thundered
through
the
window
of
the
room
where
mabel
and
her
aunt
in
the
ardour
of
reunion
were
enjoying
a
supper
of
unusual
charm
stewed
plums
cream
custard
in
cups
and
cold
pudding
gerald
in
hungry
invisibility
looked
wistfully
at
the
supper
before
he
threw
the
stone
he
waited
till
the
shrieks
had
died
away
saw
the
stone
picked
up
the
warning
letter
read
nonsense
said
the
aunt
growing
calmer
how
wicked
of
course
it
a
hoax
oh
do
send
for
the
police
like
he
says
wailed
mabel
like
who
says
snapped
the
aunt
whoever
it
is
mabel
moaned
send
for
the
police
at
once
said
gerald
outside
in
the
manliest
voice
he
could
find
you
only
blame
yourself
if
you
do
i
ca
do
any
more
for
you
i
i
set
the
dogs
on
you
cried
the
aunt
oh
auntie
mabel
was
dancing
with
agitation
it
true
i
know
it
true
do
do
wake
bates
i
do
believe
a
word
of
it
said
the
aunt
no
more
did
bates
when
owing
to
mabel
persistent
worryings
he
was
awakened
but
when
he
had
seen
the
paper
and
had
to
choose
whether
he
go
to
the
and
see
that
there
really
was
anything
to
believe
or
go
for
the
police
on
his
bicycle
he
chose
the
latter
course
when
the
police
arrived
the
door
stood
ajar
and
the
silver
or
as
much
of
it
as
three
men
could
carry
was
gone
gerald
and
pencil
came
into
play
again
later
on
that
night
it
was
five
in
the
morning
before
he
crept
into
bed
tired
out
and
cold
as
a
stone
master
gerald
it
was
eliza
voice
in
his
ears
it
seven
and
another
fine
day
and
there
been
another
burglary
my
cats
alive
she
screamed
as
she
drew
up
the
blind
and
turned
towards
the
bed
look
at
his
bed
all
crocked
with
black
and
him
not
there
oh
jimminy
it
was
a
scream
this
time
kathleen
came
running
from
her
room
jimmy
sat
up
in
his
bed
and
rubbed
his
eyes
whatever
is
it
kathleen
cried
i
dunno
when
i
such
a
turn
eliza
sat
down
heavily
on
a
box
as
she
spoke
first
thing
his
bed
all
empty
and
black
as
the
chimley
back
and
him
not
in
it
and
then
when
i
looks
again
he
in
it
all
the
time
i
must
be
going
silly
i
thought
as
much
when
i
heard
them
haunting
angel
voices
yesterday
morning
but
i
tell
of
you
my
lad
with
your
tricks
you
may
rely
on
that
blacking
yourself
all
over
like
a
dirty
nigger
and
crocking
up
your
clean
sheets
and
it
going
back
of
beyond
this
is
look
here
said
gerald
slowly
i
going
to
tell
you
something
eliza
simply
snorted
and
that
was
rude
of
her
but
then
she
had
had
a
shock
and
had
not
got
over
it
can
you
keep
a
secret
asked
gerald
very
earnest
through
the
grey
of
his
partly
blacklead
yes
said
eliza
then
keep
it
and
i
give
you
two
bob
but
what
was
you
going
to
tell
me
that
about
the
two
bob
and
the
secret
and
you
keep
your
mouth
shut
i
did
ought
to
take
it
said
eliza
holding
out
her
hand
eagerly
now
you
get
up
and
mind
you
wash
all
the
corners
master
gerald
oh
i
so
glad
you
safe
said
kathleen
when
eliza
had
gone
you
did
seem
to
care
much
last
night
said
gerald
coldly
i
ca
think
how
i
let
you
go
i
did
care
last
night
but
when
i
woke
this
morning
and
remembered
there
that
do
it
come
off
on
you
said
gerald
through
the
reckless
hugging
of
his
sister
how
did
you
get
visible
jimmy
asked
it
just
happened
when
she
called
me
the
ring
came
off
tell
us
all
about
everything
said
kathleen
not
yet
said
gerald
mysteriously
where
the
ring
jimmy
asked
after
breakfast
want
to
have
a
try
now
i
i
forgot
it
said
gerald
i
expect
it
in
the
bed
somewhere
but
it
was
eliza
had
made
the
bed
i
swear
there
aint
no
ring
there
she
said
i
should
seen
it
if
there
had
been
chapter
v
search
and
research
proving
vain
said
gerald
when
every
corner
of
the
bedroom
had
been
turned
out
and
the
ring
had
not
been
found
the
noble
detective
hero
of
our
tale
remarked
that
he
would
have
other
fish
to
fry
in
half
a
jiff
and
if
the
rest
of
you
want
to
hear
about
last
night
let
keep
it
till
we
get
to
mabel
said
kathleen
heroically
the
assignation
was
was
it
why
should
gerald
gas
as
we
go
along
i
do
suppose
anything
very
much
happened
anyhow
this
of
course
was
jimmy
that
shows
remarked
gerald
sweetly
how
much
know
the
melancholy
mabel
will
await
the
tryst
without
success
as
far
as
this
one
is
concerned
fish
other
fish
other
fish
i
fry
he
warbled
to
the
tune
of
cherry
ripe
till
kathleen
could
have
pinched
him
jimmy
turned
coldly
away
remarking
when
you
quite
done
but
gerald
went
on
singing
the
lips
of
johnson
smile
there
the
land
of
cherry
isle
other
fish
other
fish
fish
i
fry
stately
johnson
come
and
buy
how
can
you
asked
kathleen
be
so
aggravating
i
do
know
said
gerald
returning
to
prose
want
of
sleep
or
intoxication
of
success
i
mean
come
where
no
one
can
hear
us
oh
come
to
some
island
where
no
one
can
hear
and
beware
of
the
keyhole
that
glued
to
an
ear
he
whispered
opened
the
door
suddenly
and
there
sure
enough
was
eliza
stooping
without
she
flicked
feebly
at
the
wainscot
with
a
duster
but
concealment
was
vain
you
know
what
listeners
never
hear
said
jimmy
severely
i
did
then
so
there
said
eliza
whose
listening
ears
were
crimson
so
they
passed
out
and
up
the
high
street
to
sit
on
the
churchyard
wall
and
dangle
their
legs
and
all
the
way
gerald
lips
were
shut
into
a
thin
obstinate
line
said
kathleen
oh
jerry
do
be
a
goat
i
simply
dying
to
hear
what
happened
that
better
said
gerald
and
he
told
his
story
as
he
told
it
some
of
the
white
mystery
and
magic
of
the
moonlit
gardens
got
into
his
voice
and
his
words
so
that
when
he
told
of
the
statues
that
came
alive
and
the
great
beast
that
was
alive
through
all
its
stone
kathleen
thrilled
responsive
clutching
his
arm
and
even
jimmy
ceased
to
kick
the
wall
with
his
boot
heels
and
listened
then
came
the
thrilling
tale
of
the
burglars
and
the
warning
letter
flung
into
the
peaceful
company
of
mabel
her
aunt
and
the
pudding
gerald
told
the
story
with
the
greatest
enjoyment
and
such
fulness
of
detail
that
the
church
clock
chimed
eleven
as
he
said
having
done
all
that
human
agency
could
do
and
further
help
being
despaired
of
our
gallant
young
detective
hullo
there
mabel
there
was
the
of
a
cart
shed
her
almost
at
their
feet
i
could
wait
any
longer
she
explained
when
you
did
come
and
i
got
a
lift
has
anything
more
happened
the
burglars
had
gone
when
bates
got
to
the
you
do
mean
to
say
all
that
wheeze
is
jimmy
asked
of
course
it
real
said
kathleen
go
on
jerry
he
just
got
to
where
he
threw
the
stone
into
your
pudding
mabel
go
on
mabel
climbed
on
to
the
wall
you
got
visible
again
quicker
than
i
did
she
said
gerald
nodded
and
resumed
our
story
must
be
told
in
as
few
words
as
possible
owing
to
the
taking
place
at
twelve
and
it
past
the
now
having
left
his
missive
to
do
its
warning
work
gerald
de
sherlock
holmes
sped
back
wrapped
in
invisibility
to
the
spot
where
by
the
light
of
their
the
burglars
were
still
still
burgling
with
the
utmost
punctuality
and
despatch
i
did
see
any
sense
in
running
into
danger
so
i
just
waited
outside
the
passage
where
the
steps
are
you
know
mabel
nodded
presently
they
came
out
very
cautiously
of
course
and
looked
about
them
they
did
see
me
so
deeming
themselves
unobserved
they
passed
in
silent
indian
file
along
the
passage
one
of
the
sacks
of
silver
grazed
my
front
part
and
out
into
the
night
but
which
way
through
the
little
room
where
you
looked
at
yourself
when
you
were
invisible
the
hero
followed
swiftly
on
his
invisible
the
three
miscreants
instantly
sought
the
shelter
of
the
groves
and
passed
stealthily
among
the
rhododendrons
and
across
the
park
and
his
voice
dropped
and
he
looked
straight
before
him
at
the
pinky
convolvulus
netting
a
heap
of
stones
beyond
the
white
dust
of
the
road
the
stone
things
that
come
alive
they
kept
looking
out
from
between
bushes
and
under
trees
and
saw
them
all
right
but
they
did
see
me
they
saw
the
burglars
though
right
enough
but
the
burglars
could
see
them
rum
was
it
the
stone
things
mabel
had
to
have
them
explained
to
her
never
saw
them
come
alive
she
said
and
i
been
in
the
gardens
in
the
evening
as
often
as
often
saw
them
said
gerald
stiffly
i
know
i
know
mabel
hastened
to
put
herself
right
with
him
what
i
mean
to
say
is
i
should
wonder
if
they
only
visible
when
the
liveness
of
them
i
mean
not
the
stoniness
gerald
understood
and
i
sure
i
hope
you
do
i
should
wonder
if
you
right
he
said
the
castle
enchanted
right
enough
but
what
i
should
like
to
know
is
and
why
i
say
come
on
i
got
to
catch
johnson
before
twelve
we
walk
as
far
as
the
market
and
then
we
have
to
run
for
it
but
go
on
with
the
adventure
said
mabel
you
can
talk
as
we
go
oh
do
it
is
so
awfully
thrilling
this
pleased
gerald
of
course
well
i
just
followed
you
know
like
in
a
dream
and
they
got
out
the
cavy
way
you
know
where
we
got
in
and
i
jolly
well
thought
i
lost
them
i
had
to
wait
till
they
moved
off
down
the
road
so
that
they
should
hear
me
rattling
the
stones
and
i
had
to
tear
to
catch
them
up
i
took
my
shoes
off
i
expect
my
stockings
are
done
for
and
i
followed
and
followed
and
followed
and
they
went
through
the
place
where
the
poor
people
live
and
right
down
to
the
river
and
i
say
we
must
run
for
it
so
the
story
stopped
and
the
running
began
they
caught
johnson
in
his
own
washing
at
a
bench
against
his
own
look
here
johnson
gerald
said
what
you
give
me
if
i
put
you
up
to
winning
that
fifty
pounds
reward
halves
said
johnson
promptly
and
a
clout
your
head
if
you
was
coming
any
of
your
nonsense
over
me
it
nonsense
said
gerald
very
impressively
if
you
let
us
in
i
tell
you
all
about
it
and
when
you
caught
the
burglars
and
got
the
swag
back
you
just
give
me
a
quid
for
luck
i
wo
ask
for
more
come
along
in
then
said
johnson
if
the
young
ladies
excuse
the
towel
but
i
bet
you
want
something
more
off
of
me
else
why
not
claim
the
reward
yourself
great
is
the
wisdom
of
johnson
he
speaks
winged
words
the
children
were
all
in
the
cottage
now
and
the
door
was
shut
i
want
you
never
to
let
on
who
told
you
let
them
think
it
was
your
own
unaided
pluck
and
farsightedness
sit
you
down
said
johnson
and
if
you
kidding
you
best
send
the
little
gells
home
afore
i
begin
on
you
illustration
look
here
johnson
gerald
said
what
you
give
me
if
i
put
you
up
to
winning
that
fifty
pounds
reward
i
am
not
kidding
replied
gerald
loftily
never
less
and
any
one
but
a
policeman
would
see
why
i
do
want
any
one
to
know
it
was
me
i
found
it
out
at
dead
of
night
in
a
place
where
i
was
supposed
to
be
and
there
be
a
beastly
row
if
they
found
out
at
home
about
me
being
out
nearly
all
night
do
you
see
my
daisy
johnson
was
now
too
interested
as
jimmy
said
afterwards
to
mind
what
silly
names
he
was
called
he
said
he
did
see
and
asked
to
see
more
well
do
you
ask
any
questions
then
i
tell
you
all
it
good
for
you
to
know
last
night
about
eleven
i
was
at
yalding
towers
no
it
does
matter
how
i
got
there
or
what
i
got
there
for
and
there
was
a
window
open
and
i
got
in
and
there
was
a
light
and
it
was
in
the
and
there
were
three
men
putting
silver
in
a
bag
was
it
you
give
the
warning
and
they
sent
for
the
police
johnson
was
leaning
eagerly
forward
a
hand
on
each
knee
yes
that
was
me
you
can
let
them
think
it
was
you
if
you
like
you
were
off
duty
were
you
i
was
said
johnson
in
the
arms
of
murphy
well
the
police
did
come
quick
enough
but
was
there
a
lonely
detective
and
i
followed
them
you
did
and
i
saw
them
hide
the
booty
and
i
know
the
other
stuff
from
houghton
court
in
the
same
place
and
i
heard
them
arrange
about
when
to
take
it
away
come
and
show
me
where
said
johnson
jumping
up
so
quickly
that
his
windsor
fell
over
backwards
with
a
crack
on
the
floor
not
so
said
gerald
calmly
if
you
go
near
the
spot
before
the
appointed
time
you
find
the
silver
but
you
never
catch
the
thieves
you
right
there
the
policeman
picked
up
his
chair
and
sat
down
in
it
again
well
well
there
to
be
a
motor
to
meet
them
in
the
lane
beyond
the
by
sadler
rents
at
one
they
get
the
things
out
at
twelve
and
take
them
along
in
a
boat
so
your
chance
to
fill
your
pockets
with
chink
and
cover
yourself
with
honour
and
glory
so
help
me
johnson
was
pensive
and
doubtful
still
so
help
me
you
have
made
all
this
up
out
of
your
head
oh
yes
i
could
but
i
did
now
look
here
it
the
chance
of
your
lifetime
johnson
a
quid
for
me
and
a
still
tongue
for
you
and
the
job
done
do
you
agree
oh
agree
right
enough
said
johnson
i
but
if
coming
any
of
your
larks
ca
you
he
is
kathleen
put
in
impatiently
he
not
a
liar
we
none
of
us
are
if
you
not
on
say
so
said
gerald
and
i
find
another
policeman
with
more
sense
i
could
split
about
you
being
out
all
night
said
johnson
but
you
would
be
so
ungentlemanly
said
mabel
brightly
do
you
be
so
unbelieving
when
we
trying
to
do
you
a
good
turn
if
i
were
you
gerald
advised
i
go
to
the
place
where
the
silver
is
with
two
other
men
you
could
make
a
nice
little
ambush
in
the
it
close
there
and
i
have
two
or
three
more
men
up
trees
in
the
lane
to
wait
for
the
you
ought
to
have
been
in
the
force
you
ought
said
johnson
admiringly
but
it
a
hoax
well
then
you
have
made
an
ass
of
yourself
i
do
suppose
it
ud
be
the
first
time
said
jimmy
are
you
on
said
gerald
in
haste
hold
your
jaw
jimmy
you
idiot
said
johnson
then
when
you
on
duty
you
go
down
to
the
and
the
place
where
you
see
me
blow
my
nose
is
place
the
sacks
are
tied
with
string
to
the
posts
under
the
water
you
just
stalk
by
in
your
dignified
beauty
and
make
a
note
of
the
spot
that
where
glory
waits
you
and
when
fame
elates
you
and
you
a
sergeant
please
remember
me
johnson
said
he
was
blessed
he
said
it
more
than
once
and
then
remarked
that
he
was
on
and
added
that
he
must
be
off
that
instant
minute
johnson
cottage
lies
just
out
of
the
town
beyond
the
forge
and
the
children
had
come
to
it
through
the
wood
they
went
back
the
same
way
and
then
down
through
the
town
and
through
its
narrow
unsavoury
streets
to
the
by
the
timber
yard
here
they
ran
along
the
trunks
of
the
big
trees
peeped
into
the
and
the
men
were
away
at
dinner
and
this
was
a
favourite
play
place
of
every
boy
within
miles
made
themselves
a
with
a
fresh
cut
pine
plank
and
an
what
a
ripping
place
said
mabel
breathless
on
the
end
i
believe
i
like
this
better
than
pretending
games
or
even
magic
so
do
i
said
jimmy
jerry
do
keep
sniffing
so
you
have
no
nose
left
i
ca
help
it
gerald
answered
i
dare
use
my
hankey
for
fear
johnson
on
the
somewhere
unseen
i
wish
i
thought
of
some
other
signal
sniff
no
nor
i
should
want
to
now
if
i
had
got
not
to
that
what
so
rum
the
moment
i
got
down
here
and
remembered
what
i
said
about
the
signal
i
began
to
have
a
cold
and
thank
goodness
here
he
is
the
children
with
a
fine
air
of
unconcern
abandoned
the
follow
my
leader
gerald
cried
and
ran
along
a
barked
oak
trunk
the
others
following
in
and
out
and
round
about
ran
the
file
of
children
over
heaps
of
logs
under
the
jutting
ends
of
piled
planks
and
just
as
the
policeman
heavy
boots
trod
the
gerald
halted
at
the
end
of
a
little
of
rotten
boards
with
a
rickety
handrail
cried
pax
and
blew
his
nose
with
loud
fervour
morning
he
said
immediately
morning
said
johnson
got
a
cold
aint
you
ah
i
should
have
a
cold
if
i
got
boots
like
yours
returned
gerald
admiringly
look
at
them
any
one
ud
know
your
fairy
footstep
a
mile
off
how
do
you
ever
get
near
enough
to
any
one
to
arrest
them
he
skipped
off
the
whispered
as
he
passed
johnson
courage
promptitude
and
despatch
that
the
place
and
was
off
again
the
active
leader
of
an
active
procession
we
brought
a
friend
home
to
dinner
said
kathleen
when
eliza
opened
the
door
where
mademoiselle
gone
to
see
yalding
towers
show
day
you
know
an
just
you
hurry
over
your
dinners
it
my
afternoon
out
and
my
gentleman
friend
do
like
it
if
he
kept
waiting
all
right
we
eat
like
lightning
gerald
promised
set
another
place
there
an
angel
they
kept
their
word
the
dinner
it
was
minced
veal
and
potatoes
and
perhaps
the
dullest
food
in
the
world
was
over
in
a
quarter
of
an
hour
and
now
said
mabel
when
eliza
and
a
jug
of
hot
water
had
disappeared
up
the
stairs
together
where
the
ring
i
ought
to
put
it
back
illustration
gerald
halted
at
the
end
of
a
little
of
rotten
boards
i
have
had
a
turn
yet
said
jimmy
when
we
find
it
cathy
and
i
ought
to
have
turns
same
as
you
and
gerald
did
when
you
find
it
mabel
pale
face
turned
paler
between
her
dark
locks
i
very
sorry
we
all
very
sorry
began
kathleen
and
then
the
story
of
the
losing
had
to
be
told
you
could
have
looked
properly
mabel
protested
it
ca
have
vanished
you
do
know
what
it
can
do
no
more
do
we
it
no
use
getting
your
quills
up
fair
lady
perhaps
vanishing
itself
is
just
what
it
does
do
you
see
it
came
off
my
hand
in
the
bed
we
looked
everywhere
would
you
mind
if
looked
mabel
eyes
implored
her
little
hostess
you
see
if
it
lost
it
my
fault
it
almost
the
same
as
stealing
that
johnson
would
say
it
was
just
the
same
i
know
he
would
let
all
look
again
said
mabel
jumping
up
we
rather
in
a
hurry
this
morning
so
they
looked
and
they
looked
in
the
bed
under
the
bed
under
the
carpet
under
the
furniture
they
shook
the
curtains
they
explored
the
corners
and
found
dust
and
flue
but
no
ring
they
looked
and
they
looked
everywhere
they
looked
jimmy
even
looked
fixedly
at
the
ceiling
as
though
he
thought
the
ring
might
have
bounced
up
there
and
stuck
but
it
had
then
said
mabel
at
last
your
housemaid
must
have
stolen
it
all
i
shall
tell
her
i
think
so
and
she
would
have
done
it
too
but
at
that
moment
the
front
door
banged
and
they
knew
that
eliza
had
gone
forth
in
all
the
glory
of
her
best
things
to
meet
her
gentleman
friend
it
no
use
mabel
was
almost
in
tears
look
here
will
you
leave
me
alone
perhaps
you
others
looking
distracts
me
and
i
go
over
every
inch
of
the
room
by
myself
respecting
the
emotion
of
their
guest
the
kindly
withdrew
said
gerald
and
they
closed
the
door
softly
from
the
outside
on
mabel
and
her
search
they
waited
for
her
of
course
politeness
demanded
it
and
besides
they
had
to
stay
at
home
to
let
mademoiselle
in
though
it
was
a
dazzling
day
and
jimmy
had
just
remembered
that
gerald
pockets
were
full
of
the
money
earned
at
the
fair
and
that
nothing
had
yet
been
bought
with
that
money
except
a
few
buns
in
which
he
had
had
no
share
and
of
course
they
waited
impatiently
it
seemed
about
an
hour
and
was
really
quite
ten
minutes
before
they
heard
the
bedroom
door
open
and
mabel
feet
on
the
stairs
she
has
found
it
gerald
said
how
do
you
know
jimmy
asked
the
way
she
walks
said
gerald
you
can
in
fact
almost
always
tell
whether
the
thing
has
been
found
that
people
have
gone
to
look
for
by
the
sound
of
their
feet
as
they
return
mabel
feet
said
no
go
as
plain
as
they
could
speak
and
her
face
confirmed
the
cheerless
news
a
sudden
and
violent
knocking
at
the
back
door
prevented
any
one
from
having
to
be
polite
about
how
sorry
they
were
or
fanciful
about
being
sure
the
ring
would
turn
up
soon
all
the
servants
except
eliza
were
away
on
their
holidays
so
the
children
went
together
to
open
the
door
because
as
gerald
said
if
it
was
the
baker
they
could
buy
a
cake
from
him
and
eat
it
for
dessert
that
kind
of
dinner
sort
of
dessert
he
said
but
it
was
not
the
baker
when
they
opened
the
door
they
saw
in
the
paved
court
where
the
pump
is
and
the
and
the
a
young
man
with
his
hat
very
much
on
one
side
his
mouth
open
under
his
fair
bristly
moustache
and
his
eyes
as
nearly
round
as
human
eyes
can
be
he
wore
a
suit
of
a
bright
mustard
colour
a
blue
necktie
and
a
goldish
across
his
waistcoat
his
body
was
thrown
back
and
his
right
arm
stretched
out
towards
the
door
and
his
expression
was
that
of
a
person
who
is
being
dragged
somewhere
against
his
will
he
looked
so
strange
that
kathleen
tried
to
shut
the
door
in
his
face
murmuring
escaped
insane
but
the
door
would
not
close
there
was
something
in
the
way
leave
go
of
me
said
the
young
man
ho
yus
i
leave
go
of
you
it
was
the
voice
of
eliza
but
no
eliza
could
be
seen
who
got
hold
of
you
asked
kathleen
has
miss
replied
the
unhappy
stranger
who
she
asked
kathleen
to
gain
time
as
she
afterwards
explained
for
she
now
knew
well
enough
that
what
was
keeping
the
door
open
was
eliza
unseen
foot
my
fyongsay
miss
at
least
it
sounds
like
her
voice
and
it
feels
like
her
bones
but
something
come
over
me
miss
an
i
ca
see
her
that
what
he
keeps
on
saying
said
eliza
voice
e

gentleman
friend

i

said
jimmy
now
said
eliza

yourself
a
man

the
face
and
say

said
the
wretched
gentleman
friend
if

gerald
looking
at
the
sky
i
should
go
indoors
and
be
quiet
not

the
back
door
and
make
an
exhibition
of
myself

jimmy

the
gentleman
friend
here
you

me
be

my
eyes

of

d
hear
suddenly
his
hand
dropped
and
he
staggered
back
against
the
eliza
had
left
go
of
him
she
pushed
past
the
children
shoving
them
aside
with
her
invisible
elbows
gerald
caught
her
by
the
arm
with
one
hand
felt
for
her
ear
with
the
other
and
whispered
you
stand
still
and
do
say
a
word
if
you
do
well
what
to
stop
me
from
sending
for
the
police
illustration
he
staggered
back
against
the
eliza
did
not
know
what
there
was
to
stop
him
so
she
did
as
she
was
told
and
stood
invisible
and
silent
save
for
a
sort
of
blowing
snorting
noise
peculiar
to
her
when
she
was
out
of
breath
the
young
man
had
recovered
his
balance
and
stood
looking
at
the
children
with
eyes
if
possible
rounder
than
before
what
it
he
gasped
feebly
what
up
what
it
all
about
if
you
do
know
i
afraid
we
ca
tell
you
said
gerald
politely
have
i
been
talking
very
he
asked
taking
off
his
hat
and
passing
his
hand
over
his
forehead
very
said
mabel
i
hope
i
have
said
anything
that
was
good
manners
he
said
anxiously
not
at
all
said
kathleen

hold
of
your
hand
and
that
you
could
see
her
no
more
i

said
mabel
but
i
could
have
dreamed
it
and
then
come
along
here
making
a
penny
show
of
myself
like
this
could
i
you
know
best
said
gerald
courteously
but
the
victim
almost
screamed
do
you
mean
to
tell
me
i
do
mean
to
tell
you
anything
said
gerald
quite
truly
but
give
you
a
bit
of
advice
you

home
and
lie
down
a
bit
and
put
a
wet
rag
on
your
head
you
be
all
right
but

mabel

said
but

say

mabel

i
never

a
child
we
wo

kathleen

he
said
dreamily
all
the
same
i
can
feel
the
print
of
her
on
my
hand
while
i
saying
it
and
you
wo
let
it
get
round
to
my
boss
my
employer

mean
fits
of
all
sorts
are
against
a
man
in
any
trade
no
no
no
it
all
right
said
every
one
and
a
silence
fell
as
he
went
slowly
round
the
and
the
green
shut
behind
him
the
silence
was
broken
by
eliza
give
me
up
she
said
give
me
up
to
break
my
heart
in
a
prison
cell
there
was
a
sudden
splash
and
a
round
wet
drop
lay
on
the
doorstep
thunder
shower
said
jimmy
but
it
was
a
tear
from
eliza
give
me
up
she
went
on
give
me
up
splash
but
do
let
me
be
took
here
in
the
town
where
i
known
and
respected
splash
i
walk
ten
miles
to
be
took
by
a
strange
police
not
johnson
as
keeps
company
with
my
own
cousin
splash
but
i
do
thank
you
for
one
thing
you
did
tell
elf
as
i
stolen
the
ring
and
i
did
splash
i
only
sort
of
borrowed
it
it
being
my
day
out
and
my
gentleman
friend
such
a
toff
like
you
can
see
for
yourselves
the
children
had
watched
spellbound
the
interesting
tears
that
became
visible
as
they
rolled
off
the
invisible
nose
of
the
miserable
eliza
now
gerald
roused
himself
and
spoke
it
no
use
your
talking
he
said
we
ca
see
you
that
what
said
said
eliza
voice
but
you
ca
see
yourself
gerald
went
on
where
your
hand
eliza
no
doubt
tried
to
see
it
and
of
course
failed
for
instantly
with
a
shriek
that
might
have
brought
the
police
if
there
had
been
any
about
she
went
into
a
violent
fit
of
hysterics
the
children
did
what
they
could
everything
that
they
had
read
of
in
books
as
suitable
to
such
occasions
but
it
is
extremely
difficult
to
do
the
right
thing
with
an
invisible
housemaid
in
strong
hysterics
and
her
best
clothes
that
was
why
the
best
hat
was
found
later
on
to
be
completely
ruined
and
why
the
best
blue
dress
was
never
quite
itself
again
and
as
they
were
burning
bits
of
the
feather
as
nearly
under
eliza
nose
as
they
could
guess
a
sudden
spurt
of
flame
and
a
horrible
smell
as
the
flame
died
between
the
quick
hands
of
gerald
showed
but
too
plainly
that
eliza
feather
boa
had
tried
to
help
it
did
help
eliza
came
to
with
a
deep
sob
and
said
do
burn
me
real
ostrich
stole
i
better
now
they
helped
her
up
and
she
sat
down
on
the
bottom
step
and
the
children
explained
to
her
very
carefully
and
quite
kindly
that
she
really
was
invisible
and
that
if
you
steal
or
even
borrow
rings
you
can
never
be
sure
what
will
happen
to
you
but
i
got
to
go
on
stopping
like
this
she
moaned
when
they
had
fetched
the
little
mahogany
from
its
nail
over
the
kitchen
sink
and
convinced
her
that
she
was
really
invisible
for
ever
and
ever
an
we
was
to
a
bin
married
come
easter
no
one
wo
marry
a
gell
as

said
mabel
kindly
but

it
like
measles
i
expect
you
be
all
right

said
gerald

kathleen

master
jerry
said
eliza
voice
so
you
think
it
you
see
it
going
down
inside
my
chest
it
would
be
what
i
should
call
nice
of
me
to
have
cake
showing
through
me
in
the
open
air
oh
it
a
dreadful
judgment
just
for
a
borrow
they
reassured
her
set
the
tea
deputed
kathleen
to
let
in
mademoiselle
who
came
home
tired
and
a
little
sad

mabel

walk
behind
to
conceal
your
shadow
my
aunt
take
your
hat

your
shadow
look
like
i
do
know
what
people
will
think
we
the
county
lunatic
asylum
turned
loose
it
was
then
that
the
hat
becoming
visible
in
kathleen
hand
showed
how
little
of
the
sprinkled
water
had
gone
where
it
was
meant
to
go
on
eliza
face
me
best
said
eliza
and
there
was
a
silence
with
sniffs
in
it
look
here
said
mabel
you
cheer
up
just
you
think
this
is
all
a
dream
it
just
the
kind
of
thing
you
might
dream
if
your
conscience
had
got
pains
in
it
about
the
ring
but
will
i
wake
up
again
oh
yes
you
wake
up
again
now
we
going
to
bandage
your
eyes
and
take
you
through
a
very
small
door
and
do
you
resist
or
we
bring
a
policeman
into
the
dream
like
a
shot
i
have
not
time
to
describe
eliza
entrance
into
the
cave
she
went
head
first
the
girls
propelled
and
the
boys
received
her
if
gerald
had
not
thought
of
tying
her
hands
some
one
would
certainly
have
been
scratched
as
it
was
mabel
hand
was
scraped
between
the
cold
rock
and
a
passionate
nor
will
i
tell
you
all
that
she
said
as
they
led
her
along
the
gully
and
through
the
arch
into
the
wonderland
of
italian
scenery
she
had
but
little
language
left
when
they
removed
her
bandage
under
a
weeping
willow
where
a
statue
of
diana
bow
in
hand
stood
poised
on
one
toe
a
most
unsuitable
attitude
for
archery
i
have
always
thought
now
said
gerald
it
all
over
nothing
but
niceness
now
and
cake
and
things
it
time
we
did
have
our
tea
said
jimmy
and
it
was
eliza
once
convinced
that
her
chest
though
invisible
was
not
transparent
and
that
her
companions
could
not
by
looking
through
it
count
how
many
buns
she
had
eaten
made
an
excellent
meal
so
did
the
others
if
you
want
really
to
enjoy
your
tea
have
minced
veal
and
potatoes
and
for
dinner
with
several
hours
of
excitement
to
follow
and
take
your
tea
late
the
soft
cool
green
and
grey
of
the
garden
were
changing
the
green
grew
golden
the
shadows
black
and
the
lake
where
the
swans
were
mirrored
upside
down
under
the
temple
of
phœbus
was
bathed
in
rosy
light
from
the
little
fluffy
clouds
that
lay
opposite
the
sunset
it
pretty
said
eliza
just
like
a
aint
it
the
tuppenny
kind
i
ought
to
be
getting
home
said
mabel
i
ca
go
home
like
this
i
stay
and
be
a
savage
and
live
in
that
white
hut
if
it
had
any
walls
and
doors
said
eliza
she
means
the
temple
of
dionysus
said
mabel
pointing
to
it
the
sun
set
suddenly
behind
the
line
of
black
on
the
top
of
the
slope
and
the
white
temple
that
had
been
pink
turned
grey
it
would
be
a
very
nice
place
to
live
in
even
as
it
is
said
kathleen
draughty
said
eliza
and
law
what
a
lot
of
steps
to
clean
what
they
make
houses
for
without
no
walls
to
who
live
in
she
broke
off
stared
and
added
what
that
what
that
white
thing
coming
down
the
steps
why
it
a
young
man
in
statooary
the
statues
do
come
alive
here
after
sunset
said
gerald
in
very
tones
i
see
they
do
eliza
did
not
seem
at
all
surprised
or
alarmed
there
another
of
look
at
them
little
wings
to
his
feet
like
pigeons
i
expect
that
mercury
said
gerald
it
under
the
statue
that
got
wings
on
its
feet
said
mabel
but
do
see
any
statues
said
jimmy
what
are
you
punching
me
for
do
you
see
gerald
whispered
but
he
need
not
have
been
so
troubled
for
all
eliza
attention
was
with
her
wandering
eyes
that
followed
hither
and
thither
the
quick
movements
of
unseen
statues
do
you
see
the
statues
come
alive
when
the
sun
goes
down
and
you
ca
see
them
unless
you
invisible
and
if
you
see
them
you
not
frightened
unless
you
them
let
get
her
to
touch
one
and

said
jimmy
lep
into
the
water
said
eliza
in
a
rapt
voice
my
ca
he
swim
neither
and
the
one
with
the
pigeons
wings
is
flying
all
over
the
lake
having
larks
with
i
do
call
that
pretty
it
like
cupids
as
you
see
on
and
here
another
of
a
little
chap
with
long
ears
and
a
baby
deer
galloping
alongside
an
look
at
the
lady
with
the
biby
throwing
it
up
and
catching
it
like
as
if
it
was
a
ball
i
wonder
she
ai
afraid
but
it
pretty
to
see
illustration
lep
into
the
water
said
eliza
in
a
rapt
voice
my
ca
he
swim
neither
the
broad
park
lay
stretched
before
the
children
in
growing
greyness
and
a
stillness
that
deepened
amid
the
thickening
shadows
they
could
see
the
statues
gleam
white
and
motionless
but
eliza
saw
other
things
she
watched
in
silence
presently
and
they
watched
silently
and
the
evening
fell
like
a
veil
that
grew
heavier
and
blacker
and
it
was
night
and
the
moon
came
up
above
the
trees
oh
cried
eliza
suddenly
here
the
dear
little
boy
with
the
deer
he
coming
right
for
me
bless
his
heart
next
moment
she
was
screaming
and
her
screams
grew
fainter
and
there
was
the
sound
of
swift
boots
on
gravel
come
on
cried
gerald
she
touched
it
and
then
she
was
frightened
just
like
i
was
run
she
send
every
one
in
the
town
mad
if
she
gets
there
like
that
just
a
voice
and
boots
run
run
they
ran
but
eliza
had
the
start
of
them
also
when
she
ran
on
the
grass
they
could
not
hear
her
footsteps
and
had
to
wait
for
the
sound
of
leather
on
gravel
also
she
was
driven
by
fear
and
fear
drives
fast
she
went
it
seemed
the
nearest
way
invisibly
through
the
waxing
moonlight
seeing
she
only
knew
what
amid
the
glades
and
groves
i
stop
here
see
you
gasped
mabel
as
the
loud
pursuers
followed
eliza
clatter
across
the
terrace
she
gone
through
the
stable
yard
the
back
way
gerald
panted
as
they
turned
the
corner
of
their
own
street
and
he
and
jimmy
swung
in
past
the
an
unseen
but
agitated
presence
seemed
to
be
fumbling
with
the
locked
the
church
clock
struck
the
nine
gerald
had
just
breath
to
say
pull
at
the
ring
perhaps
it
come
off
now
he
spoke
to
the
bare
doorstep
but
it
was
eliza
dishevelled
breathless
her
hair
coming
down
her
collar
crooked
her
dress
twisted
and
disordered
who
suddenly
held
out
a
hand
a
hand
that
they
could
see
and
in
the
hand
plainly
visible
in
the
moonlight
the
dark
circle
of
the
magic
ring
a
mo
said
eliza
gentleman
friend
next
morning
he
was
waiting
for
her
when
she
opened
the
door
with
pail
and
hearthstone
in
her
hand
sorry
you
could
come
out
yesterday
so
i
eliza
swept
the
wet
flannel
along
the
top
step
what
did
you
do
illustration
it
was
eliza
dishevelled
breathless
her
hair
coming
down
her
collar
crooked
her
dress
twisted
and
disordered
who
suddenly
held
out
a
hand
i
a
bit
of
a
headache
said
the
gentleman
friend
i
laid
down
most
of
the
afternoon
what
were
you
up
to
oh
nothing
pertickler
said
eliza
then
it
was
all
a
dream
she
said
when
he
was
gone
but
it
be
a
lesson
to
me
not
to
meddle
with
anybody
old
ring
again
in
a
hurry
so
they
did
tell
about
me
behaving
like
i
did
said
he
as
he
went
sun
i
suppose
like
our
army
in
india
i
hope
i
aint
going
to
be
liable
to
it
that
all
chapter
vi
johnson
was
the
hero
of
the
hour
it
was
he
who
had
tracked
the
burglars
laid
his
plans
and
recovered
the
lost
silver
he
had
not
thrown
the
stone
public
opinion
decided
that
mabel
and
her
aunt
must
have
been
mistaken
in
supposing
that
there
was
a
stone
at
all
but
he
did
not
deny
the
warning
letter
it
was
gerald
who
went
out
after
breakfast
to
buy
the
newspaper
and
who
read
aloud
to
the
others
the
two
columns
of
fiction
which
were
the
report
of
the
facts
as
he
read
every
mouth
opened
wider
and
wider
and
when
he
ceased
with
this
gifted
with
detective
instincts
which
outrival
those
of
lecoq
and
holmes
and
whose
promotion
is
now
assured
there
was
quite
a
blank
silence
well
said
jimmy
breaking
it
he
does
stick
it
on
neither
does
he
i
feel
said
kathleen
as
if
it
was
our
fault
as
if
it
was
us
had
told
all
these
whoppers
because
if
it
had
been
for
you
they
have
jerry
how
could
he
say
all
that
well
said
gerald
trying
to
be
fair
you
know
after
all
the
chap
had
to
say
something
i
glad
i
he
stopped
abruptly
you
glad
you
what
no
matter
said
he
with
an
air
of
putting
away
affairs
of
state
now
what
are
we
going
to
do
the
faithful
mabel
approaches
she
will
want
her
ring

jimmy

any
attention

to
her
for
more
days

hero

to
confess
i
wish

always
call

said
jimmy

said
kathleen
hastily

smiled
annoyingly
keep

a
good
temper

kathleen

said
jimmy
and
sniffed
kathleen
turned
a
despairing
look
on
gerald
oh
james

said
gerald
sadly
how
difficult
you
make
it
for
me
to
forget

little
brother

i
treat
you
like
one
of
the
other
chaps

again

my
hero
and
heroine
the
devoted
mesrour
is
your
salaaming
slave
the
three
met
mabel
opportunely
at
the
corner
of
the
square
where
every
friday
the
stalls
and
the
awnings
and
the
green
umbrellas
were
pitched
and
poultry
pork
pottery
vegetables
drapery
sweets
toys
tools
mirrors
and
all
sorts
of
other
interesting
merchandise
were
spread
out
on
trestle
tables
piled
on
carts
whose
horses
were
stabled
and
whose
shafts
were
held
in
place
by
piled
wooden
cases
or
laid
out
as
in
the
case
of
crockery
and
hardware
on
the
bare
flagstones
of
the
the
sun
was
shining
with
great
goodwill
and
as
mabel
remarked
all
nature
looked
smiling
and
gay
there
were
a
few
bunches
of
flowers
among
the
vegetables
and
the
children
hesitated
balanced
in
choice
mignonette
is
sweet
said
mabel
roses
are
roses
said
kathleen
carnations
are
tuppence
said
jimmy
and
gerald
sniffing
among
the
bunches
of
agreed
that
this
settled
it
so
the
carnations
were
bought
a
bunch
of
yellow
ones
like
sulphur
a
bunch
of
white
ones
like
clotted
cream
and
a
bunch
of
red
ones
like
the
cheeks
of
the
doll
that
kathleen
never
played
with
they
took
the
carnations
home
and
kathleen
green
came
in
beautifully
for
tying
them
up
which
was
hastily
done
on
the
doorstep
then
discreetly
gerald
knocked
at
the
door
of
the
where
mademoiselle
seemed
to
sit
all
day
entrez
came
her
voice
and
gerald
entered
she
was
not
reading
as
usual
but
bent
over
a
on
the
table
was
an
open
of
appearance
and
a
box
of
that
liquid
so
familiar
alike
to
the
greatest
artist
in
and
to
the
humblest
child
with
a
with
all
of
our
loves
said
gerald
laying
the
flowers
down
suddenly
before
her
but
it
is
that
you
are
a
dear
child
for
this
it
must
that
i
embrace
you
no
and
before
gerald
could
explain
that
he
was
too
old
she
kissed
him
with
little
quick
french
pecks
on
the
two
cheeks
are
you
painting
he
asked
hurriedly
to
hide
his
annoyance
at
being
treated
like
a
baby
i
achieve
a
sketch
of
yesterday
she
answered
and
before
he
had
time
to
wonder
what
yesterday
would
look
like
in
a
picture
she
showed
him
a
beautiful
and
exact
sketch
of
yalding
towers
illustration
she
kissed
him
with
little
quick
french
pecks
oh
i
say
ripping
was
the
critic
comment
i
say
may
the
others
come
and
see
the
others
came
including
mabel
who
stood
awkwardly
behind
the
rest
and
looked
over
jimmy
shoulder
i
say
you
are
clever
said
gerald
respectfully
to
what
good
to
have
the
talent
when
one
must
pass
one
life
at
teaching
the
infants
said
mademoiselle
it
must
be
fairly
beastly
gerald
owned
you
too
see
the
design
mademoiselle
asked
mabel
adding
a
friend
from
the
town
yes
how
do
you
do
said
mabel
politely
no
i
not
from
the
town
i
live
at
yalding
towers
the
name
seemed
to
impress
mademoiselle
very
much
gerald
anxiously
hoped
in
his
own
mind
that
she
was
not
a
snob
yalding
towers
she
repeated
but
this
is
very
extraordinary
is
it
possible
that
you
are
then
of
the
family
of
lord
yalding
he
has
any
family
said
mabel
he
not
married
i
would
say
are
you
how
you
say
cousin
sister
niece
no
said
mabel
flushing
hotly
i
nothing
grand
at
all
i
lord
yalding
housekeeper
niece
but
you
know
lord
yalding
is
it
not
no
said
mabel
i
never
seen
him
he
comes
then
never
to
his
château
not
since
i
lived
there
but
he
coming
next
week
why
lives
he
not
there
mademoiselle
asked
auntie
say
he
too
poor
said
mabel
and
proceeded
to
tell
the
tale
as
she
had
heard
it
in
the
housekeeper
room
how
lord
yalding
uncle
had
left
all
the
money
he
could
leave
away
from
lord
yalding
to
lord
yalding
second
cousin
and
poor
lord
yalding
had
only
just
enough
to
keep
the
old
place
in
repair
and
to
live
very
quietly
indeed
somewhere
else
but
not
enough
to
keep
the
house
open
or
to
live
there
and
how
he
could
sell
the
house
because
it
was
in
tale
what
is
it
then
in
tail
asked
mademoiselle
in
a
tale
that
the
lawyers
write
out
said
mabel
proud
of
her
knowledge
and
flattered
by
the
deep
interest
of
the
french
governess
and
when
once
they
put
your
house
in
one
of
their
tales
you
sell
it
or
give
it
away
but
you
have
to
leave
it
to
your
son
even
if
you
do
want
to
but
how
his
uncle
could
he
be
so
cruel
to
leave
him
the
château
and
no
money
mademoiselle
asked
and
kathleen
and
jimmy
stood
amazed
at
the
sudden
keenness
of
her
interest
in
what
seemed
to
them
the
dullest
story
oh
i
can
tell
you
that
too
said
mabel
lord
yalding
wanted
to
marry
a
lady
his
uncle
did
want
him
to
a
barmaid
or
a
ballet
lady
or
something
and
he
would
give
her
up
and
his
uncle
said
then
and
left
everything
to
the
cousin
and
you
say
he
is
not
married
no
the
lady
went
into
a
convent
i
expect
she
alive
by
now
bricked
in
a
wall
you
know
said
mabel
pointing
explainingly
at
the
pink
and
gilt
roses
of
the
shut
up
to
kill
them
that
what
they
do
to
you
in
convents
not
at
all
said
mademoiselle
in
convents
are
very
kind
good
women
there
is
but
one
thing
in
convents
that
is
detestable
the
locks
on
the
doors
sometimes
people
can
not
get
out
especially
when
they
are
very
young
and
their
relations
have
placed
them
there
for
their
welfare
and
happiness
but
brick
how
you
say
it
enwalling
ladies
to
kill
them
no
it
does
itself
never
and
this
lord
he
did
not
then
seek
his
lady
oh
yes
he
sought
her
right
enough
mabel
assured
her
but
there
are
millions
of
convents
you
know
and
he
had
no
idea
where
to
look
and
they
sent
back
his
letters
from
the
and
ciel
cried
mademoiselle
but
it
seems
that
one
knows
all
in
the
housekeeper
saloon
pretty
well
all
said
mabel
simply
and
you
think
he
will
find
her
no
oh
he
find
her
all
right
said
mabel
when
he
old
and
broken
down
you
know
and
dying
and
then
a
gentle
sister
of
charity
will
soothe
his
pillow
and
just
when
he
dying
she
reveal
herself
and
say
own
lost
love
and
his
face
will
light
up
with
a
wonderful
joy
and
he
expire
with
her
beloved
name
on
his
parched
lips
mademoiselle
was
the
silence
of
sheer
astonishment
you
do
the
prophesy
it
appears
she
said
at
last
oh
no
said
mabel
i
got
that
out
of
a
book
i
can
tell
you
lots
more
fatal
love
stories
any
time
you
like
the
french
governess
gave
a
little
jump
as
though
she
had
suddenly
remembered
something
it
is
nearly
she
said
your
friend
mabelle
yes
will
be
your
convivial
and
in
her
honour
we
will
make
a
little
feast
my
beautiful
flowers
put
them
to
the
water
kathleen
i
run
to
buy
the
cakes
wash
the
hands
all
and
be
ready
when
i
return
smiling
and
nodding
to
the
children
she
left
them
and
ran
up
the
stairs
just
as
if
she
was
young
said
kathleen
she
young
said
mabel
heaps
of
ladies
have
offers
of
marriage
when
they
no
younger
than
her
i
seen
lots
of
weddings
too
with
much
older
brides
and
why
did
you
tell
me
she
was
so
beautiful
she
asked
kathleen
of
course
she
is
and
what
a
darling
to
think
of
cakes
for
me
and
calling
me
a
convivial
look
here
said
gerald
i
call
this
jolly
decent
of
her
you
know
governesses
never
have
more
than
the
meanest
pittance
just
enough
to
sustain
life
and
here
she
is
spending
her
little
all
on
us
supposing
we
just
do
go
out
but
play
with
her
instead
i
expect
most
awfully
bored
really
would
she
really
like
it
kathleen
wondered
aunt
emily
says
never
really
like
playing
they
do
it
to
please
us
they
little
know
gerald
answered
how
often
we
do
it
to
please
them
we
got
to
do
that
with
the
princess
clothes
anyhow
we
said
we
would
said
kathleen
let
treat
her
to
that
rather
near
urged
jimmy
so
that
there
be
a
fortunate
interruption
and
the
play
wo
go
on
for
ever
i
suppose
all
the
things
are
safe
mabel
asked
quite
i
told
you
where
i
put
them
come
on
jimmy
let
help
lay
the
table
we
get
eliza
to
put
out
the
best
china
they
went
it
was
lucky
said
gerald
struck
by
a
sudden
thought
that
the
burglars
did
go
for
the
diamonds
in
the
they
could
said
mabel
almost
in
a
whisper
they
did
know
about
them
i
do
believe
anybody
knows
about
them
except
me
and
you
and
you
sworn
to
secrecy
this
you
will
remember
had
been
done
almost
at
the
beginning
i
know
aunt
does
know
i
just
found
out
the
spring
by
accident
lord
yalding
kept
the
secret
well
i
wish
i
got
a
secret
like
that
to
keep
said
gerald
if
the
burglars
know
said
mabel
it
all
come
out
at
the
trial
lawyers
make
you
tell
everything
you
know
at
trials
and
a
lot
of
lies
besides
there
wo
be
any
trial
said
gerald
kicking
the
leg
of
the
piano
thoughtfully
no
trial
it
said
in
the
paper
gerald
went
on
slowly
miscreants
must
have
received
warning
from
a
confederate
for
the
admirable
preparations
to
arrest
them
as
they
returned
for
their
plunder
were
unavailing
but
the
police
have
a
clue
what
a
pity
said
mabel
you
need
worry
they
have
got
any
old
clue
said
gerald
still
attentive
to
the
piano
leg
i
did
mean
the
clue
i
meant
the
confederate
it
a
pity
you
think
he
a
pity
because
he
was
said
gerald
standing
up
and
leaving
the
piano
leg
alone
he
looked
straight
before
him
as
the
boy
on
the
burning
deck
may
have
looked
i
could
help
it
he
said
i
know
you
think
i
a
criminal
but
i
could
do
it
i
do
know
how
detectives
can
i
went
over
a
prison
once
with
father
and
after
i
given
the
tip
to
johnson
i
remembered
that
and
i
just
could
i
know
i
a
beast
and
not
worthy
to
be
a
british
citizen
i
think
it
was
rather
nice
of
you
said
mabel
kindly
how
did
you
warn
them
i
just
shoved
a
paper
under
the
man
door
the
one
that
i
knew
where
he
lived
to
tell
him
to
lie
low
oh
do
tell
me
what
did
you
put
on
it
exactly
mabel
warmed
to
this
new
interest
it
said
police
know
all
except
your
names
be
virtuous
and
you
are
safe
but
if
there
any
more
burgling
i
shall
split
and
you
may
rely
on
that
from
a
friend
i
know
it
was
wrong
but
i
could
help
it
do
tell
the
others
they
would
understand
why
i
did
it
i
do
understand
it
myself
i
do
said
mabel
it
because
you
got
a
kind
and
noble
heart
kind
fiddlestick
my
good
child
said
gerald
suddenly
losing
the
burning
boy
expression
and
becoming
in
a
flash
entirely
himself
cut
along
and
wash
your
hands
you
as
black
as
ink
so
are
you
said
mabel
and
i
not
it
dye
with
me
auntie
was
dyeing
a
blouse
this
morning
it
told
you
how
in
and
she
as
black
as
ink
too
and
the
blouse
is
all
streaky
pity
the
ring
wo
make
just
parts
of
you
invisible
the
dirt
for
instance
perhaps
gerald
said
unexpectedly
it
wo
make
even
all
of
you
invisible
again
why
not
you
have
been
doing
anything
to
it
have
you
mabel
sharply
asked
no
but
did
you
notice
you
were
invisible
hours
i
was
fourteen
hours
invisible
and
eliza
only
seven
that
seven
less
each
time
and
now
we
come
to
how
frightfully
good
you
are
at
sums
said
mabel
awestruck
you
see
it
got
seven
hours
less
each
time
and
seven
from
seven
is
nought
it
got
to
be
something
different
this
time
and
then
afterwards
it
ca
be
minus
seven
because
i
do
see
how
unless
it
made
you
more
visible
thicker
you
know
said
mabel
you
make
my
head
go
round
and
there
another
odd
thing
gerald
went
on
when
you
invisible
your
relations
do
love
you
look
at
your
aunt
and
cathy
never
turning
a
hair
at
me
going
burgling
we
have
got
to
the
bottom
of
that
ring
yet
crikey
here
mademoiselle
with
the
cakes
run
bold
bandits
wash
for
your
lives
they
ran
it
was
not
cakes
only
it
was
plums
and
grapes
and
jam
tarts
and
and
raspberry
vinegar
and
chocolates
in
pretty
boxes
and
pure
thick
rich
cream
in
brown
jugs
also
a
big
bunch
of
roses
mademoiselle
was
strangely
merry
for
a
governess
she
served
out
the
cakes
and
tarts
with
a
liberal
hand
made
wreaths
of
the
flowers
for
all
their
heads
she
was
not
eating
much
herself
drank
the
health
of
mabel
as
the
guest
of
the
day
in
the
beautiful
pink
drink
that
comes
from
mixing
raspberry
vinegar
and
and
actually
persuaded
jimmy
to
wear
his
wreath
on
the
ground
that
the
greek
gods
as
well
as
the
goddesses
always
wore
wreaths
at
a
feast
there
never
was
such
a
feast
provided
by
any
french
governess
since
french
governesses
began
there
were
jokes
and
stories
and
laughter
jimmy
showed
all
those
tricks
with
forks
and
corks
and
matches
and
apples
which
are
so
deservedly
popular
mademoiselle
told
them
stories
of
her
own
when
she
was
a
quite
little
girl
with
two
tight
tresses
so
and
when
they
could
not
understand
the
tresses
called
for
paper
and
pencil
and
drew
the
loveliest
little
picture
of
herself
when
she
was
a
child
with
two
short
fat
sticking
out
from
her
head
like
from
a
ball
of
dark
worsted
then
she
drew
pictures
of
everything
they
asked
for
till
mabel
pulled
gerald
jacket
and
whispered
the
acting
draw
us
the
front
of
a
theatre
said
gerald
tactfully
a
french
theatre
they
are
the
same
thing
as
the
english
theatres
mademoiselle
told
him
do
you
like
acting
the
theatre
i
mean
but
yes
i
love
it
all
right
said
gerald
briefly
we
act
a
play
for
you
now
this
afternoon
if
you
like
eliza
will
be
washing
up
cathy
whispered
and
she
was
promised
to
see
it
or
this
evening
said
gerald
and
please
mademoiselle
may
eliza
come
in
and
look
on
but
certainly
said
mademoiselle
amuse
yourselves
well
my
children
but
it
said
mabel
suddenly
that
we
want
to
amuse
because
we
love
you
very
much
do
we
all
of
you
yes
the
chorus
came
unhesitatingly
though
the
others
would
never
have
thought
of
saying
such
a
thing
on
their
own
account
yet
as
mabel
said
it
they
found
to
their
surprise
that
it
was
true
tiens
said
mademoiselle
you
love
the
old
french
governess
impossible
and
she
spoke
rather
indistinctly
you
not
old
said
mabel
at
least
not
so
very
she
added
brightly
and
you
as
lovely
as
a
princess
go
then
flatteress
said
mademoiselle
laughing
and
mabel
went
the
others
were
already
up
the
stairs
illustration
down
came
the
loveliest
hair
mademoiselle
sat
in
the
as
usual
and
it
was
a
good
thing
that
she
was
not
engaged
in
serious
study
for
it
seemed
that
the
door
opened
and
shut
almost
ceaselessly
all
throughout
the
afternoon
might
they
have
the
embroidered
antimacassars
and
the
sofa
cushions
might
they
have
the
out
of
the
washhouse
eliza
said
they
might
but
might
they
might
they
have
the
sheepskin
might
they
have
tea
in
the
garden
because
they
had
almost
got
the
stage
ready
in
the
and
eliza
wanted
to
set
tea
could
mademoiselle
lend
them
any
coloured
clothes
scarves
or
or
anything
bright
yes
mademoiselle
could
and
did
silk
things
surprisingly
lovely
for
a
governess
to
have
had
mademoiselle
any
rouge
they
had
always
heard
that
french
ladies
no
mademoiselle
had
and
to
judge
by
the
colour
of
her
face
mademoiselle
did
need
it
did
mademoiselle
think
the
chemist
sold
rouge
or
had
she
any
false
hair
to
spare
at
this
challenge
mademoiselle
pale
fingers
pulled
out
a
dozen
hairpins
and
down
came
the
loveliest
hair
hanging
to
her
knees
in
straight
heavy
lines
no
you
terrible
infants
she
cried
i
have
not
the
false
hair
nor
the
rouge
and
my
teeth
you
want
them
also
without
doubt
she
showed
them
in
a
laugh
i
you
were
a
princess
said
mabel
and
now
i
know
rupunzel
do
always
wear
your
hair
like
that
may
we
have
the
peacock
fans
please
off
the
mantelpiece
and
the
things
that
loop
back
the
curtains
and
all
the
handkerchiefs
you
got
mademoiselle
denied
them
nothing
they
had
the
fans
and
the
handkerchiefs
and
some
large
sheets
of
expensive
out
of
the
school
cupboard
and
mademoiselle
best
sable
and
her
who
would
have
thought
murmured
gerald
pensively
sucking
the
brush
and
gazing
at
the
paper
mask
he
had
just
painted
that
she
was
such
a
brick
in
disguise
i
wonder
why
crimson
lake
always
tastes
just
like
liebig
extract
everything
was
pleasant
that
day
somehow
there
are
some
days
like
that
you
know
when
everything
goes
well
from
the
very
beginning
all
the
things
you
want
are
in
their
places
nobody
misunderstands
you
and
all
that
you
do
turns
out
admirably
how
different
from
those
other
days
which
we
all
know
too
well
when
your
breaks
your
comb
is
mislaid
your
brush
spins
on
its
back
on
the
floor
and
lands
under
the
bed
where
you
ca
get
at
it
you
drop
the
soap
your
buttons
come
off
an
eyelash
gets
into
your
eye
you
have
used
your
last
clean
handkerchief
your
collar
is
frayed
at
the
edge
and
cuts
your
neck
and
at
the
very
last
moment
your
suspender
breaks
and
there
is
no
string
on
such
a
day
as
this
you
are
naturally
late
for
breakfast
and
every
one
thinks
you
did
it
on
purpose
and
the
day
goes
on
and
on
getting
worse
and
worse
you
mislay
your
you
drop
your
arithmetic
in
the
mud
your
pencil
breaks
and
when
you
open
your
knife
to
sharpen
the
pencil
you
split
your
nail
on
such
a
day
you
jam
your
thumb
in
doors
and
muddle
the
messages
you
are
sent
on
by
you
upset
your
tea
and
your
wo
hold
together
for
a
moment
and
when
at
last
you
get
to
bed
usually
in
disgrace
it
is
no
comfort
at
all
to
you
to
know
that
not
a
single
bit
of
it
is
your
own
fault
this
day
was
not
one
of
those
days
as
you
will
have
noticed
even
the
tea
in
the
garden
there
was
a
bricked
bit
by
a
rockery
that
made
a
steady
floor
for
the
was
most
delightful
though
the
thoughts
of
four
out
of
the
five
were
busy
with
the
coming
play
and
the
fifth
had
thoughts
of
her
own
that
had
had
nothing
to
do
with
tea
or
acting
then
there
was
an
interval
of
slamming
doors
interesting
silences
feet
that
flew
up
and
down
stairs
it
was
still
good
daylight
when
the
rang
the
signal
had
been
agreed
upon
at
and
carefully
explained
to
eliza
mademoiselle
laid
down
her
book
and
passed
out
of
the
hall
into
the
faint
yellow
gaslight
of
the
the
giggling
eliza
held
the
door
open
before
her
and
followed
her
in
the
shutters
had
been
closed
streaks
of
daylight
showed
above
and
below
them
the
tablecloths
of
the
school
were
supported
on
the
from
the
backyard
the
line
sagged
in
a
graceful
curve
but
it
answered
its
purpose
of
supporting
the
curtains
which
concealed
that
part
of
the
room
which
was
the
stage
illustration
she
saw
that
fully
half
a
dozen
of
these
chairs
were
occupied
and
by
the
queerest
people
rows
of
chairs
had
been
placed
across
the
other
end
of
the
room
all
the
chairs
in
the
house
as
it
seemed
and
mademoiselle
started
violently
when
she
saw
that
fully
half
a
dozen
of
these
chairs
were
occupied
and
by
the
queerest
people
too
an
old
woman
with
a
poke
bonnet
tied
under
her
chin
with
a
red
handkerchief
a
lady
in
a
large
straw
hat
wreathed
in
flowers
and
the
oddest
hands
that
stuck
out
over
the
chair
in
front
of
her
several
men
with
strange
clumsy
figures
and
all
with
hats
on
but
whispered
mademoiselle
through
the
chinks
of
the
tablecloths
you
have
then
invited
other
friends
you
should
have
asked
me
my
children
laughter
and
something
like
a
hurrah
answered
her
from
behind
the
folds
of
the
curtaining
tablecloths
all
right
mademoiselle
rapunzel
cried
mabel
turn
the
gas
up
only
part
of
the
entertainment
eliza
still
giggling
pushed
through
the
lines
of
chairs
knocking
off
the
hat
of
one
of
the
visitors
as
she
did
so
and
turned
up
the
three
incandescent
burners
mademoiselle
looked
at
the
figure
seated
nearest
to
her
stooped
to
look
more
closely
half
laughed
quite
screamed
and
sat
down
suddenly
oh
she
cried
they
are
not
alive
eliza
with
a
much
louder
scream
had
found
out
the
same
thing
and
announced
it
differently
they
ai
got
no
insides
said
she
the
seven
members
of
the
audience
seated
among
the
wilderness
of
chairs
had
indeed
no
insides
to
speak
of
their
bodies
were
bolsters
and
blankets
their
spines
were
and
their
arm
and
leg
bones
were
hockey
sticks
and
umbrellas
their
shoulders
were
the
wooden
that
mademoiselle
used
for
keeping
her
jackets
in
shape
their
hands
were
gloves
stuffed
out
with
handkerchiefs
and
their
faces
were
the
paper
masks
painted
in
the
afternoon
by
the
untutored
brush
of
gerald
tied
on
to
the
round
heads
made
of
the
ends
of
stuffed
the
faces
were
really
rather
dreadful
gerald
had
done
his
best
but
even
after
his
best
had
been
done
you
would
hardly
have
known
they
were
faces
some
of
them
if
they
had
been
in
the
positions
which
faces
visually
occupy
between
the
collar
and
the
hat
their
eyebrows
were
furious
with
frowns
their
eyes
the
size
and
almost
the
shape
of
pieces
and
on
their
lips
and
cheeks
had
been
spent
much
crimson
lake
and
nearly
the
whole
of
a
of
vermilion
you
have
made
yourself
an
auditors
yes
bravo
cried
mademoiselle
recovering
herself
and
beginning
to
clap
and
to
the
sound
of
that
clapping
the
curtain
went
up
or
rather
apart
a
voice
said
in
a
breathless
choked
way
beauty
and
the
beast
and
the
stage
was
revealed
it
was
a
real
stage
too
the
pushed
close
together
and
covered
with
counterpanes
it
was
a
little
unsteady
and
creaky
to
walk
on
but
very
imposing
to
look
at
the
scene
was
simple
but
convincing
a
big
sheet
of
cardboard
bent
square
with
slits
cut
in
it
and
a
candle
behind
represented
quite
transparently
the
domestic
hearth
a
round
of
eliza
supported
on
a
stool
with
a
under
it
could
not
have
been
mistaken
save
by
wilful
malice
for
anything
but
a
copper
a
basket
with
two
or
three
school
dusters
and
an
overcoat
in
it
and
a
pair
of
blue
pyjamas
over
the
back
of
a
chair
put
the
finishing
touch
to
the
scene
it
did
not
need
the
announcement
from
the
wings
the
laundry
at
home
it
was
so
plainly
a
laundry
and
nothing
else
in
the
wings
they
look
just
like
a
real
audience
do
they
whispered
mabel
go
on
jimmy
do
forget
the
merchant
has
to
be
pompous
and
use
long
words
jimmy
enlarged
by
pillows
under
gerald
best
overcoat
which
had
been
intentionally
bought
with
a
view
to
his
probable
growth
during
the
two
years
which
it
was
intended
to
last
him
a
turkish
towel
turban
on
his
head
and
an
open
umbrella
over
it
opened
the
first
act
in
a
simple
and
swift
soliloquy
i
am
the
most
unlucky
merchant
that
ever
was
i
was
once
the
richest
merchant
in
bagdad
but
i
lost
all
my
ships
and
now
i
live
in
a
poor
house
that
is
all
to
bits
you
can
see
how
the
rain
comes
through
the
roof
and
my
daughters
take
in
washing
and
the
pause
might
have
seemed
long
but
gerald
rustled
in
elegant
in
mademoiselle
pink
and
the
character
of
the
eldest
daughter
a
nice
drying
day
he
minced
pa
dear
put
the
umbrella
the
other
way
up
it
save
us
going
out
in
the
rain
to
fetch
water
come
on
sisters
dear
father
got
us
a
new
here
luxury
round
the
umbrella
now
held
the
wrong
way
up
the
three
sisters
knelt
and
washed
imaginary
linen
kathleen
wore
a
violet
skirt
of
eliza
a
blue
blouse
of
her
own
and
a
cap
of
knotted
handkerchiefs
a
white
nightdress
girt
with
a
white
apron
and
two
red
carnations
in
black
hair
left
no
doubt
as
to
which
of
the
three
was
beauty
the
scene
went
very
well
the
final
dance
with
waving
towels
was
all
that
there
is
of
charming
mademoiselle
said
and
eliza
was
so
much
amused
that
as
she
said
she
got
quite
a
nasty
stitch
along
of
laughing
so
hearty
you
know
pretty
well
what
beauty
and
the
beast
would
be
like
acted
by
four
children
who
had
spent
the
afternoon
in
arranging
their
costumes
and
so
had
left
no
time
for
rehearsing
what
they
had
to
say
yet
it
delighted
them
and
it
charmed
their
audience
and
what
more
can
any
play
do
even
shakespeare
mabel
in
her
princess
clothes
was
a
resplendent
beauty
and
gerald
a
beast
who
wore
the
hearthrugs
with
an
air
of
indescribable
distinction
if
jimmy
was
not
a
talkative
merchant
he
made
it
up
with
a
stoutness
practically
unlimited
and
kathleen
surprised
and
delighted
even
herself
by
the
quickness
with
which
she
changed
from
one
to
the
other
of
the
minor
characters
fairies
servants
and
messengers
it
was
at
the
end
of
the
second
act
that
mabel
whose
costume
having
reached
the
height
of
elegance
could
not
be
bettered
and
therefore
did
not
need
to
be
changed
said
to
gerald
sweltering
under
the
weighty
magnificence
of
his
i
say
you
might
let
us
have
the
ring
back
i
going
to
said
gerald
who
had
quite
forgotten
it
i
give
it
you
in
the
next
scene
only
do
lose
it
or
go
putting
it
on
you
might
go
out
all
together
and
never
be
seen
again
or
you
might
get
seven
times
as
visible
as
any
one
else
so
that
all
the
rest
of
us
would
look
like
shadows
beside
you
you
be
so
thick
or
ready
said
kathleen
bustling
in
once
more
a
wicked
sister
gerald
managed
to
get
his
hand
into
his
pocket
under
his
hearthrug
and
when
he
rolled
his
eyes
in
agonies
of
sentiment
and
said
farewell
dear
beauty
return
quickly
for
if
you
remain
long
absent
from
your
faithful
beast
he
will
assuredly
perish
he
pressed
a
ring
into
her
hand
and
added
this
is
a
magic
ring
that
will
give
you
anything
you
wish
when
you
desire
to
return
to
your
own
disinterested
beast
put
on
the
ring
and
utter
your
wish
instantly
you
will
be
by
my
side
took
the
ring
and
it
was
ring
the
curtains
closed
to
warm
applause
from
two
pairs
of
hands
the
next
scene
went
splendidly
the
sisters
were
almost
natural
in
their
disagreeableness
and
beauty
annoyance
when
they
splashed
her
princess
dress
with
real
soap
and
water
was
considered
a
miracle
of
good
acting
even
the
merchant
rose
to
something
more
than
mere
pillows
and
the
curtain
fell
on
his
pathetic
assurance
that
in
the
absence
of
his
dear
beauty
he
was
wasting
away
to
a
shadow
and
again
two
pairs
of
hands
applauded
here
mabel
catch
hold
gerald
appealed
from
under
the
weight
of
a
the
the
and
the
green
baize
apron
of
the
boot
boy
which
together
with
four
red
geraniums
from
the
landing
the
from
the
fireplace
and
the
indiarubber
plants
from
the
window
were
to
represent
the
fountains
and
garden
of
the
last
act
the
applause
had
died
away
i
wish
said
mabel
taking
on
herself
the
weight
of
the
i
wish
those
creatures
we
made
were
alive
we
should
get
something
like
applause
then
i
jolly
glad
they
are
said
gerald
arranging
the
baize
and
the
brutes
it
makes
me
feel
quite
silly
when
i
catch
their
paper
eyes
the
curtains
were
drawn
back
there
lay
the
beast
in
flat
abandonment
among
the
tropic
beauties
of
the
garden
the
shrubbery
the
indiarubber
plant
bushes
the
and
the
urn
fountain
beauty
was
ready
to
make
her
great
entry
in
all
the
thrilling
splendour
of
despair
and
then
suddenly
it
all
happened
mademoiselle
began
it
she
applauded
the
garden
scene
with
hurried
little
clappings
of
her
quick
french
hands
eliza
fat
red
palms
followed
heavily
and
then
some
one
else
was
clapping
six
or
seven
people
and
their
clapping
made
a
dull
padded
sound
nine
faces
instead
of
two
were
turned
towards
the
stage
and
seven
out
of
the
nine
were
painted
pointed
paper
faces
and
every
hand
and
every
face
was
alive
the
applause
grew
louder
as
mabel
glided
forward
and
as
she
paused
and
looked
at
the
audience
her
unstudied
pose
of
horror
and
amazement
drew
forth
applause
louder
still
but
it
was
not
loud
enough
to
drown
the
shrieks
of
mademoiselle
and
eliza
as
they
rushed
from
the
room
knocking
chairs
over
and
crushing
each
other
in
the
doorway
two
distant
doors
banged
mademoiselle
door
and
eliza
door
curtain
curtain
quick
cried
in
a
voice
that
mabel
or
the
beauty
jerry
those
things
come
alive
oh
whatever
we
do
gerald
in
his
hearthrugs
leaped
to
his
feet
again
that
flat
padded
applause
marked
the
swish
of
cloths
on
as
jimmy
and
kathleen
drew
the
curtains
what
up
they
asked
as
they
drew
you
done
it
this
time
said
gerald
to
the
pink
perspiring
mabel
oh
bother
these
strings
ca
you
burst
them
done
it
retorted
mabel
i
like
that
more
than
i
do
said
gerald
oh
it
all
right
said
mabel
come
on
we
must
go
and
pull
the
things
to
pieces
then
they
go
on
being
alive
it
your
fault
anyhow
said
gerald
with
every
possible
absence
of
gallantry
do
you
see
it
turned
into
a
wishing
ring
i
something
different
was
going
to
happen
get
my
knife
out
of
my
pocket
this
string
in
a
knot
jimmy
cathy
those
have
come
alive
because
mabel
wished
it
cut
out
and
pull
them
to
pieces
jimmy
and
cathy
peeped
through
the
curtain
and
recoiled
with
white
faces
and
staring
eyes
not
me
was
the
brief
rejoinder
of
jimmy
cathy
said
not
much
and
she
meant
it
any
one
could
see
that
and
now
as
gerald
almost
free
of
the
broke
his
on
the
stiffest
blade
of
his
knife
a
thick
rustling
and
a
sharp
heavy
stumping
sounded
beyond
the
curtain
they
going
out
screamed
kathleen
out
on
their
umbrella
and
broomstick
legs
you
ca
stop
them
jerry
they
too
awful
everybody
in
the
town
be
insane
by
night
if
we
stop
them
cried
gerald
here
give
me
the
ring
i
unwish
them
illustration
a
limp
hand
was
laid
on
his
arm
he
caught
the
ring
from
the
unresisting
mabel
cried
i
wish
the
uglies
alive
and
tore
through
the
door
he
saw
in
fancy
wish
undone
and
the
empty
hall
strewed
with
limp
bolsters
hats
umbrellas
coats
and
gloves
prone
abject
properties
from
which
the
brief
life
had
gone
out
for
ever
but
the
hall
was
crowded
with
live
things
strange
things
all
horribly
short
as
broomsticks
and
umbrellas
are
short
a
limp
hand
gesticulated
a
pointed
white
face
with
red
cheeks
looked
up
at
him
and
wide
red
lips
said
something
he
could
not
tell
what
the
voice
reminded
him
of
the
old
beggar
down
by
the
bridge
who
had
no
roof
to
his
mouth
these
creatures
had
no
roofs
to
their
mouths
of
course
they
had
no
aa
oo
ré
o
me
me
oo
a
oo
ho
el
said
the
voice
again
and
it
had
said
it
four
times
before
gerald
could
collect
himself
sufficiently
to
understand
that
this
horror
alive
and
most
likely
quite
uncontrollable
was
saying
with
a
dreadful
calm
polite
persistence
can
you
recommend
me
to
a
good
hotel
chapter
vii
can
you
recommend
me
to
a
good
hotel
the
speaker
had
no
inside
to
his
head
gerald
had
the
best
of
reasons
for
knowing
it
the
speaker
coat
had
no
shoulders
inside
it
only
the
that
a
jacket
is
slung
on
by
careful
ladies
the
hand
raised
in
interrogation
was
not
a
hand
at
all
it
was
a
glove
lumpily
stuffed
with
and
the
arm
attached
to
it
was
only
kathleen
school
umbrella
yet
the
whole
thing
was
alive
and
was
asking
a
definite
and
for
anybody
else
anybody
who
really
a
body
a
reasonable
question
with
a
sensation
of
inward
sinking
gerald
realised
that
now
or
never
was
the
time
for
him
to
rise
to
the
occasion
and
at
the
thought
he
inwardly
sank
more
deeply
than
before
it
seemed
impossible
to
rise
in
the
very
smallest
degree
i
beg
your
pardon
was
absolutely
the
best
he
could
do
and
the
painted
pointed
paper
face
turned
to
him
once
more
and
once
more
said
aa
oo
ré
o
me
me
oo
a
oo
ho
el
you
want
a
hotel
gerald
repeated
stupidly
a
hotel
a
oo
ho
el
reiterated
the
painted
lips
i
awfully
sorry
gerald
went
on
one
can
always
be
polite
of
course
whatever
happens
and
politeness
came
natural
to
him
but
all
our
hotels
shut
so
early
about
eight
i
think
och
em
er
said
the
gerald
even
now
does
not
understand
how
that
practical
joke
hastily
wrought
of
hat
overcoat
paper
face
and
limp
hands
could
have
managed
by
just
being
alive
to
become
perfectly
respectable
apparently
about
fifty
years
old
and
obviously
well
off
known
and
respected
in
his
own
suburb
the
kind
of
man
who
travels
first
class
and
smokes
expensive
cigars
gerald
knew
this
time
without
need
of
repetition
that
the
had
said
knock
up
you
ca
gerald
explained
they
all
stone
deaf
every
single
person
who
keeps
a
hotel
in
this
town
it
he
wildly
plunged
a
county
council
law
only
deaf
people
allowed
to
keep
hotels
because
of
the
hops
in
the
beer
he
found
himself
adding
you
know
hops
are
so
good
for
earache
i
o
wy
ollo
oo
said
the
respectable
and
gerald
was
not
surprised
to
find
that
the
thing
did
not
quite
follow
him
it
a
little
difficult
at
first
he
said
the
other
were
crowding
round
the
lady
in
the
poke
bonnet
said
gerald
found
he
was
getting
quite
clever
at
understanding
the
conversation
of
those
who
had
no
roofs
to
their
mouths
if
not
a
hotel
a
lodging
my
lodging
is
on
the
cold
ground
sang
itself
unhidden
and
unavailing
in
gerald
ear
yet
stay
was
it
unavailing
i
do
know
a
lodging
he
said
slowly
but
the
tallest
of
the
pushed
forward
he
was
dressed
in
the
old
brown
overcoat
and
which
always
hung
on
the
school
to
discourage
possible
burglars
by
deluding
them
into
the
idea
that
there
was
a
and
that
he
was
at
home
he
had
an
air
at
once
more
sporting
and
less
reserved
than
that
of
the
first
speaker
and
any
one
could
see
that
he
was
not
quite
a
gentleman
wa
i
wo
oo
oh
he
began
but
the
lady
in
the
hat
interrupted
him
she
spoke
more
distinctly
than
the
others
owing
as
gerald
found
afterwards
to
the
fact
that
her
mouth
had
been
drawn
and
the
flap
cut
from
the
aperture
had
been
folded
back
so
that
she
really
had
something
like
a
roof
to
her
mouth
though
it
was
only
a
paper
one
what
want
to
know
gerald
understood
her
to
say
is
where
are
the
carriages
we
ordered
i
do
know
said
gerald
but
i
find
out
but
we
ought
to
be
moving
he
added
you
see
the
performance
is
over
and
they
want
to
shut
up
the
house
and
put
the
lights
out
let
be
moving
eh
ech
e
repeated
the
respectable
and
stepped
towards
the
front
door
oo
um
oo
said
the
one
and
gerald
assures
me
that
her
vermilion
lips
stretched
in
a
smile
i
shall
be
delighted
said
gerald
with
earnest
courtesy
to
do
anything
of
course
things
do
happen
so
awkwardly
when
you
least
expect
it
i
could
go
with
you
and
get
you
a
lodging
if
you
only
wait
a
few
moments
in
the
in
the
yard
it
quite
a
superior
sort
of
yard
he
went
on
as
a
wave
of
surprised
disdain
passed
over
their
white
paper
faces
not
a
common
yard
you
know
the
pump
he
added
madly
has
just
been
painted
green
all
over
and
the
dustbin
is
enamelled
iron
the
turned
to
each
other
in
consultation
and
gerald
gathered
that
the
greenness
of
the
pump
and
the
enamelled
character
of
the
made
in
their
opinion
all
the
difference
i
awfully
sorry
he
urged
eagerly
to
have
to
ask
you
to
wait
but
you
see
i
got
an
uncle
who
quite
mad
and
i
have
to
give
him
his
gruel
at
nine
he
wo
feed
out
of
any
hand
but
mine
gerald
did
not
mind
what
he
said
the
only
people
one
is
allowed
to
tell
lies
to
are
the
they
are
all
clothes
and
have
no
insides
because
they
are
not
human
beings
but
only
a
sort
of
very
real
visions
and
therefore
can
not
be
really
deceived
though
they
may
seem
to
be
through
the
back
door
that
has
the
blue
yellow
red
and
green
glass
in
it
down
the
iron
steps
into
the
yard
gerald
led
the
way
and
the
trooped
after
him
some
of
them
had
boots
but
the
ones
whose
feet
were
only
broomsticks
or
umbrellas
found
the
iron
stairs
very
awkward
if
you
would
said
gerald
just
waiting
the
balcony
my
uncle
is
so
mad
if
he
were
to
see
see
any
strangers
i
mean
even
aristocratic
ones
i
could
answer
for
the
consequences
perhaps
said
the
lady
nervously
it
would
be
better
for
us
to
try
and
find
a
lodging
ourselves
i
would
advise
you
to
said
gerald
as
grimly
as
he
knew
how
the
police
here
arrest
strangers
it
the
new
law
the
liberals
have
just
made
he
added
convincingly
and
you
get
the
sort
of
lodging
you
would
care
for
i
could
bear
to
think
of
you
in
a
prison
dungeon
he
added
tenderly
i
ah
wi
oo
er
papers
said
the
respectable
and
added
something
that
sounded
like
disgraceful
state
of
things
however
they
ranged
themselves
under
the
iron
balcony
gerald
gave
one
last
look
at
them
and
wondered
in
his
secret
heart
why
he
was
not
frightened
though
in
his
outside
mind
he
was
congratulating
himself
on
his
bravery
for
the
things
did
look
rather
horrid
in
that
light
it
was
hard
to
believe
that
they
were
really
only
clothes
and
pillows
and
sticks
with
no
insides
as
he
went
up
the
steps
he
heard
them
talking
among
themselves
in
that
strange
language
of
theirs
all
oo
and
ah
and
he
thought
he
distinguished
the
voice
of
the
respectable
saying
most
gentlemanly
lad
and
the
lady
answering
warmly
yes
indeed
the
door
closed
behind
him
behind
him
was
the
yard
peopled
by
seven
impossible
creatures
before
him
lay
the
silent
house
peopled
as
he
knew
very
well
by
five
human
beings
as
frightened
as
human
beings
could
be
you
think
perhaps
that
are
nothing
to
be
frightened
of
that
only
because
you
have
never
seen
one
come
alive
you
just
make
one
any
old
suit
of
your
father
and
a
hat
that
he
is
wearing
a
bolster
or
two
a
painted
paper
face
a
few
sticks
and
a
pair
of
boots
will
do
the
trick
get
your
father
to
lend
you
a
wishing
ring
give
it
back
to
him
when
it
has
done
its
work
and
see
how
you
feel
then
of
course
the
reason
why
gerald
was
not
afraid
was
that
he
had
the
ring
and
as
you
have
seen
the
wearer
of
that
is
not
frightened
by
unless
he
touches
that
thing
but
gerald
knew
well
enough
how
the
others
must
be
feeling
that
was
why
he
stopped
for
a
moment
in
the
hall
to
try
and
imagine
what
would
have
been
most
soothing
to
him
if
he
had
been
as
terrified
as
he
knew
they
were
cathy
i
say
what
ho
jimmy
mabel
ahoy
he
cried
in
a
loud
cheerful
voice
that
sounded
very
unreal
to
himself
the
door
opened
a
cautious
inch
i
say
such
larks
gerald
went
on
shoving
gently
at
the
door
with
his
shoulder
look
out
what
are
you
keeping
the
door
shut
for
are
you
alone
asked
kathleen
in
hushed
breathless
tones
yes
of
course
do
be
a
duffer
the
door
opened
revealing
three
scared
faces
and
the
disarranged
chairs
where
that
odd
audience
had
sat
where
are
they
have
you
unwished
them
we
heard
them
talking
horrible
they
in
the
yard
said
gerald
with
the
best
imitation
of
joyous
excitement
that
he
could
manage
it
such
fun
they
just
like
real
people
quite
kind
and
jolly
it
the
most
ripping
lark
do
let
on
to
mademoiselle
and
eliza
i
square
then
kathleen
and
jimmy
must
go
to
bed
and
i
see
mabel
home
and
as
soon
as
we
get
outside
i
must
find
some
sort
of
lodging
for
the
they
such
fun
though
i
wish
you
could
all
go
with
me
fun
echoed
kathleen
dismally
and
doubting
perfectly
killing
gerald
asserted
resolutely
now
you
just
listen
to
what
i
say
to
mademoiselle
and
eliza
and
back
me
up
for
all
worth
but
said
mabel
you
ca
mean
that
you
going
to
leave
me
alone
directly
we
get
out
and
go
off
with
those
horrible
creatures
they
look
like
fiends
you
wait
till
you
seen
them
close
gerald
advised
why
just
the
first
thing
one
of
them
did
was
to
ask
me
to
recommend
it
to
a
good
hotel
i
could
understand
it
at
first
because
it
has
no
roof
to
its
mouth
of
course
it
was
a
mistake
to
say
that
gerald
knew
it
at
once
mabel
and
kathleen
were
holding
hands
in
a
way
that
plainly
showed
how
a
few
moments
ago
they
had
been
clinging
to
each
other
in
an
agony
of
terror
now
they
clung
again
and
jimmy
who
was
sitting
on
the
edge
of
what
had
been
the
stage
kicking
his
boots
against
the
pink
counterpane
shuddered
visibly
it
does
gerald
explained
about
the
roofs
i
mean
you
soon
get
to
understand
i
heard
them
say
i
was
a
gentlemanly
lad
as
i
was
coming
away
they
would
have
cared
to
notice
a
little
thing
like
that
if
they
been
fiends
you
know
it
does
matter
how
gentlemanly
they
think
you
if
you
do
see
me
home
you
that
all
are
you
going
to
mabel
demanded
of
course
i
am
we
shall
have
no
end
of
a
lark
now
for
mademoiselle
he
had
put
on
his
coat
as
he
spoke
and
now
ran
up
the
stairs
the
others
herding
in
the
hall
could
hear
his
knock
at
mademoiselle
door
the
reassuring
it
only
me
gerald
you
know
the
pause
the
opening
of
the
door
and
the
parley
that
followed
then
mademoiselle
and
gerald
at
eliza
door
voices
of
reassurance
eliza
terror
bluntly
voluble
tactfully
soothed
wonder
what
lies
he
telling
them
jimmy
grumbled
oh
not
said
mabel
he
only
telling
them
as
much
of
the
truth
as
it
good
for
them
to
know
if
you
been
a
man
said
jimmy
witheringly
you
have
been
a
beastly
jesuit
and
hid
up
chimneys
if
i
were
only
just
a
boy
mabel
retorted
i
should
be
scared
out
of
my
life
by
a
pack
of
old
coats
i
sorry
you
were
frightened
gerald
honeyed
tones
floated
down
the
staircase
we
did
think
about
you
being
frightened
and
it
a
good
trick
was
it
there
whispered
jimmy
he
been
telling
her
it
was
a
trick
of
ours
well
so
it
was
said
mabel
stoutly
it
was
indeed
a
wonderful
trick
said
mademoiselle
and
how
did
you
move
the
mannikins
oh
we
often
done
it
with
strings
you
know
gerald
explained
that
true
too
kathleen
whispered
illustration
wonder
what
lies
he
telling
them
jimmy
grumbled
let
us
see
you
do
once
again
this
trick
so
remarkable
said
mademoiselle
arriving
at
the
mat
oh
i
cleared
them
all
out
said
gerald
so
he
has
from
kathleen
aside
to
jimmy
we
were
so
sorry
you
were
startled
we
thought
you
would
like
to
see
them
again
then
said
mademoiselle
brightly
as
she
peeped
into
the
untidy
and
saw
that
the
figures
had
indeed
vanished
if
we
supped
and
discoursed
of
your
beautiful
piece
of
theatre
gerald
explained
fully
how
much
his
brother
and
sister
would
enjoy
this
as
for
him
mademoiselle
would
see
that
it
was
his
duty
to
escort
mabel
home
and
kind
as
it
was
of
mademoiselle
to
ask
her
to
stay
the
night
it
could
not
be
on
account
of
the
frenzied
and
anxious
affection
of
mabel
aunt
and
it
was
useless
to
suggest
that
eliza
should
see
mabel
home
because
eliza
was
nervous
at
night
unless
accompanied
by
her
gentleman
friend
so
mabel
was
hatted
with
her
own
hat
and
cloaked
with
a
cloak
that
was
not
hers
and
she
and
gerald
went
out
by
the
front
door
amid
kind
last
words
and
appointments
for
the
morrow
the
moment
that
front
door
was
shut
gerald
caught
mabel
by
the
arm
and
led
her
briskly
to
the
corner
of
the
side
street
which
led
to
the
yard
just
round
the
corner
he
stopped
now
he
said
what
i
want
to
know
is
are
you
an
idiot
or
you
idiot
yourself
said
mabel
but
mechanically
for
she
saw
that
he
was
in
earnest
because
not
frightened
of
the
they
as
harmless
as
tame
rabbits
but
an
idiot
might
be
frightened
and
give
the
whole
show
away
if
you
an
idiot
say
so
and
i
go
back
and
tell
them
you
afraid
to
walk
home
and
that
i
go
and
let
your
aunt
know
you
stopping
i
not
an
idiot
said
mabel
and
she
added
glaring
round
her
with
the
wild
gaze
of
the
truly
i
not
afraid
of
i
going
to
let
you
share
my
difficulties
and
dangers
said
gerald
at
least
i
inclined
to
let
you
i
would
do
as
much
for
my
own
brother
i
can
tell
you
and
if
you
queer
my
pitch
i
never
speak
to
you
again
or
let
the
others
either
you
a
beast
that
what
you
are
i
do
need
to
be
threatened
to
make
me
brave
i
mabel
said
gerald
in
low
thrilling
tones
for
he
saw
that
the
time
had
come
to
sound
another
note
i
you
brave
i
in
you
that
why
i
arranged
it
like
this
i
certain
you
got
the
heart
of
a
lion
under
that
exterior
can
i
trust
you
to
the
death
mabel
felt
that
to
say
anything
but
yes
was
to
throw
away
a
priceless
reputation
for
courage
so
yes
was
what
she
said
then
wait
here
you
close
to
the
lamp
and
when
you
see
me
coming
with
remember
they
as
harmless
as
serpents
i
mean
doves
talk
to
them
just
like
you
would
to
any
one
else
see
he
turned
to
leave
her
but
stopped
at
her
natural
question
what
hotel
did
you
say
you
were
going
to
take
them
to
oh
jimminy
the
harassed
gerald
caught
at
his
hair
with
both
hands
there
you
see
mabel
you
a
help
already
he
had
even
at
that
moment
some
tact
left
i
clean
forgot
i
meant
to
ask
you
is
there
any
lodge
or
anything
in
the
castle
grounds
where
i
could
put
them
for
the
night
the
charm
will
break
you
know
some
time
like
being
invisible
did
and
they
just
be
a
pack
of
coats
and
things
that
we
can
easily
carry
home
any
day
is
there
a
lodge
or
anything
there
a
secret
passage
mabel
began
but
at
that
moment
the
opened
and
an
put
out
its
head
and
looked
anxiously
down
the
street
righto
gerald
ran
to
meet
it
it
was
all
mabel
could
do
not
to
run
in
an
opposite
direction
with
an
opposite
motive
it
was
all
she
could
do
but
she
did
it
and
was
proud
of
herself
as
long
as
ever
she
remembered
that
night
and
now
with
all
the
silent
precaution
necessitated
by
the
near
presence
of
an
extremely
insane
uncle
the
a
grisly
band
trooped
out
of
the
yard
door
walk
on
your
toes
dear
the
bonneted
whispered
to
the
one
with
a
wreath
and
even
at
that
thrilling
crisis
gerald
wondered
how
she
could
since
the
toes
of
one
foot
were
but
the
end
of
a
golf
club
and
of
the
other
the
end
of
a
mabel
felt
that
there
was
no
shame
in
retreating
to
the
at
the
street
corner
but
once
there
she
made
herself
halt
and
no
one
but
mabel
will
ever
know
how
much
making
that
took
think
of
it
to
stand
there
firm
and
quiet
and
wait
for
those
hollow
unbelievable
things
to
come
up
to
her
clattering
on
the
pavement
with
their
stumpy
feet
or
borne
along
noiselessly
as
in
the
case
of
the
lady
by
a
skirt
that
touched
the
ground
and
had
mabel
knew
very
well
nothing
at
all
inside
it
she
stood
very
still
the
insides
of
her
hands
grew
cold
and
damp
but
still
she
stood
saying
over
and
over
again
they
not
true
they
ca
be
true
it
only
a
dream
they
are
really
true
they
be
and
then
gerald
was
there
and
all
the
crowding
round
and
gerald
saying
this
is
one
of
our
friends
mabel
the
princess
in
the
play
you
know
be
a
man
he
added
in
a
whisper
for
her
ear
alone
mabel
all
her
nerves
stretched
tight
as
banjo
strings
had
an
awful
instant
of
not
knowing
whether
she
would
be
able
to
be
a
man
or
whether
she
would
be
merely
a
shrieking
and
running
little
mad
girl
for
the
respectable
shook
her
limply
by
the
hand
he
be
true
she
told
herself
and
the
one
took
her
arm
with
a
glove
at
the
end
of
an
umbrella
arm
and
said
you
dear
clever
little
thing
walk
with
me
in
a
gushing
girlish
way
and
in
speech
almost
wholly
lacking
in
consonants
then
they
all
walked
up
the
high
street
as
if
as
gerald
said
they
were
anybody
else
it
was
a
strange
procession
but
liddlesby
goes
early
to
bed
and
the
liddlesby
police
in
common
with
those
of
most
other
places
wear
boots
that
one
can
hear
a
mile
off
if
such
boots
had
been
heard
gerald
would
have
had
time
to
turn
back
and
head
them
off
he
felt
now
that
he
could
not
resist
a
flush
of
pride
in
mabel
courage
as
he
heard
her
polite
rejoinders
to
the
still
more
polite
remarks
of
the
amiable
he
did
not
know
how
near
she
was
to
the
scream
that
would
throw
away
the
whole
thing
and
bring
the
police
and
the
residents
out
to
the
ruin
of
everybody
they
met
no
one
except
one
man
who
murmured
guy
fawkes
swelp
me
and
crossed
the
road
hurriedly
and
when
next
day
he
told
what
he
had
seen
his
wife
disbelieved
him
and
also
said
it
was
a
judgment
on
him
which
was
unreasonable
illustration
it
was
a
strange
procession
mabel
felt
as
though
she
were
taking
part
in
a
very
completely
arranged
nightmare
but
gerald
was
in
it
too
gerald
who
had
asked
if
she
was
an
idiot
well
she
was
but
she
soon
would
be
she
felt
yet
she
went
on
answering
the
courteous
of
these
impossible
people
she
had
often
heard
her
aunt
speak
of
impossible
people
well
now
she
knew
what
they
were
like
summer
twilight
had
melted
into
summer
moonlight
the
shadows
of
the
on
the
white
road
were
much
more
horrible
than
their
more
solid
selves
mabel
wished
it
had
been
a
dark
night
and
then
corrected
the
wish
with
a
hasty
shudder
gerald
submitting
to
a
searching
interrogatory
from
the
as
to
his
schools
his
sports
pastimes
and
ambitions
wondered
how
long
the
spell
would
last
the
ring
seemed
to
work
in
sevens
would
these
things
have
seven
hours
life
or
fourteen
or
his
mind
lost
itself
in
the
intricacies
of
the
table
a
teaser
at
the
best
of
times
and
only
found
itself
with
a
shock
when
the
procession
found
at
the
gates
of
the
castle
grounds
locked
of
course
you
see
he
explained
as
the
vainly
shook
the
iron
gates
with
incredible
hands
it
so
very
late
there
another
way
but
you
have
to
climb
through
a
hole
the
ladies
the
respectable
began
objecting
but
the
ladies
with
one
voice
affirmed
that
they
loved
adventures
so
frightfully
thrilling
added
the
one
who
wore
roses
so
they
went
round
by
the
road
and
coming
to
the
hole
it
was
a
little
difficult
to
find
in
the
moonlight
which
always
disguises
the
most
familiar
things
gerald
went
first
with
the
bicycle
lantern
which
he
had
snatched
as
his
pilgrims
came
out
of
the
yard
the
shrinking
mabel
followed
and
then
the
with
hollow
rattlings
of
their
wooden
limbs
against
the
stone
crept
through
and
with
strange
of
general
amazement
manly
courage
and
feminine
nervousness
followed
the
light
along
the
passage
through
the
cutting
and
under
the
arch
when
they
emerged
on
the
moonlit
enchantment
of
the
italian
garden
a
quite
intelligible
oh
of
surprised
admiration
broke
from
more
than
one
painted
paper
lip
and
the
respectable
was
understood
to
say
that
it
must
be
quite
a
by
george
sir
yes
those
marble
terraces
and
artfully
serpentining
gravel
walks
surely
never
had
echoed
to
steps
so
strange
no
shadows
so
wildly
unbelievable
had
for
all
its
enchantments
ever
fallen
on
those
smooth
gray
dewy
lawns
gerald
was
thinking
this
or
something
like
it
what
he
really
thought
was
i
bet
there
never
was
such
a
go
as
this
even
here
when
he
saw
the
statue
of
hermes
leap
from
its
pedestal
and
run
towards
him
and
his
company
with
all
the
lively
curiosity
of
a
street
boy
eager
to
be
in
at
a
street
fight
he
saw
too
that
he
was
the
only
one
who
perceived
that
white
advancing
presence
and
he
knew
that
it
was
the
ring
that
let
him
see
what
by
others
could
not
be
seen
he
slipped
it
from
his
finger
yes
hermes
was
on
his
pedestal
still
as
the
snow
man
you
make
in
the
christmas
holidays
he
put
the
ring
on
again
and
there
was
hermes
circling
round
the
group
and
gazing
deep
in
each
unconscious
face
this
seems
a
very
superior
hotel
the
was
saying
the
grounds
are
laid
out
with
what
you
might
call
taste
we
should
have
to
go
in
by
the
back
door
said
mabel
suddenly
the
front
door
locked
at
nine
a
short
stout
in
a
yellow
and
blue
cricket
cap
who
had
hardly
spoken
muttered
something
about
an
escapade
and
about
feeling
quite
young
again
and
now
they
had
skirted
the
pool
where
the
gold
fish
swam
and
glimmered
and
where
the
great
prehistoric
beast
had
come
down
to
bathe
and
drink
the
water
flashed
white
diamonds
in
the
moonlight
and
gerald
alone
of
them
all
saw
that
the
vast
lizard
was
even
now
rolling
and
wallowing
there
among
the
lily
pads
they
hastened
up
the
steps
of
the
temple
of
flora
the
back
of
it
where
no
elegant
arch
opened
to
the
air
was
against
one
of
those
sheer
hills
almost
cliffs
that
diversified
the
landscape
of
that
garden
mabel
passed
behind
the
statue
of
the
goddess
fumbled
a
little
and
then
gerald
lantern
flashing
like
a
showed
a
very
high
and
very
narrow
doorway
the
stone
that
was
the
door
and
that
had
closed
it
revolved
slowly
under
the
touch
of
mabel
fingers
this
way
she
said
and
panted
a
little
the
back
of
her
neck
felt
cold
and
you
lead
the
way
my
lad
with
the
lantern
said
the
suburban
in
his
bluff
agreeable
way
i
i
must
stay
behind
to
close
the
door
said
gerald
the
princess
can
do
that
help
her
said
the
wreathed
one
with
effusion
and
gerald
thought
her
horribly
officious
he
insisted
gently
that
he
would
be
the
one
responsible
for
the
safe
shutting
of
that
door
you
would
like
me
to
get
into
trouble
i
sure
he
urged
and
the
for
the
last
time
kind
and
reasonable
agreed
that
this
of
all
things
they
would
most
deplore
take
it
gerald
urged
pressing
the
bicycle
lamp
on
the
elderly
you
the
natural
leader
go
straight
ahead
are
there
any
steps
he
asked
mabel
in
a
whisper
not
for
ever
so
long
she
whispered
back
it
goes
on
for
ages
and
then
twists
round
whispering
said
the
smallest
suddenly
ai
manners
has
any
anyhow
whispered
the
lady
do
mind
him
quite
a
man
and
squeezed
mabel
arm
with
horrible
confidential
flabbiness
the
respectable
leading
with
the
lamp
the
others
following
trustfully
one
and
all
disappeared
into
that
narrow
doorway
and
gerald
and
mabel
standing
without
hardly
daring
to
breathe
lest
a
breath
should
retard
the
procession
almost
sobbed
with
relief
prematurely
as
it
turned
out
for
suddenly
there
was
a
rush
and
a
scuffle
inside
the
passage
and
as
they
strove
to
close
the
door
the
fiercely
pressed
to
open
it
again
whether
they
saw
something
in
the
dark
passage
that
alarmed
them
whether
they
took
it
into
their
empty
heads
that
this
could
not
be
the
back
way
to
any
really
respectable
hotel
or
whether
a
convincing
sudden
instinct
warned
them
that
they
were
being
tricked
mabel
and
gerald
never
knew
but
they
knew
that
the
were
no
longer
friendly
and
commonplace
that
a
fierce
change
had
come
over
them
cries
of
no
no
we
wo
go
on
make
lead
broke
the
dreamy
stillness
of
the
perfect
night
there
were
screams
from
voices
the
hoarse
determined
shouts
of
strong
roused
to
resistance
and
worse
than
all
the
steady
pushing
open
of
that
narrow
stone
door
that
had
almost
closed
upon
the
ghastly
crew
through
the
chink
of
it
they
could
be
seen
a
writhing
black
crowd
against
the
light
of
the
bicycle
lamp
a
padded
hand
reached
round
the
door
arms
stretched
out
angrily
towards
the
world
that
that
door
if
it
closed
would
shut
them
off
from
for
ever
and
the
tone
of
their
consonantless
speech
was
no
longer
conciliatory
and
ordinary
it
was
threatening
full
of
the
menace
of
unbearable
horrors
the
padded
hand
fell
on
gerald
arm
and
instantly
all
the
terrors
that
he
had
so
far
only
known
in
imagination
became
real
to
him
and
he
saw
in
the
sort
of
flash
that
shows
drowning
people
their
past
lives
what
it
was
that
he
had
asked
of
mabel
and
that
she
had
given
push
push
for
your
life
he
cried
and
setting
his
heel
against
the
pedestal
of
flora
pushed
manfully
i
ca
any
more
oh
i
ca
moaned
mabel
and
tried
to
use
her
heel
likewise
but
her
legs
were
too
short
they
must
get
out
they
must
gerald
panted
you
know
it
when
we
do
came
from
inside
the
door
in
tones
which
fury
and
would
have
made
unintelligible
to
any
ears
but
those
sharpened
by
the
wild
fear
of
that
unspeakable
moment
what
up
there
cried
suddenly
a
new
voice
a
voice
with
all
its
consonants
comforting
and
ringing
and
abruptly
a
new
shadow
fell
on
the
marble
floor
of
flora
temple
come
and
help
push
gerald
voice
only
just
reached
the
newcomer
if
they
get
out
they
kill
us
all
a
strong
shoulder
pushed
suddenly
between
the
shoulders
of
gerald
and
mabel
a
stout
man
heel
sought
the
aid
of
the
goddess
pedestal
the
heavy
narrow
door
yielded
slowly
it
closed
its
spring
clicked
and
the
furious
surging
threatening
mass
of
was
shut
in
and
gerald
and
mabel
oh
incredible
relief
were
shut
out
mabel
threw
herself
on
the
marble
floor
sobbing
slow
heavy
sobs
of
achievement
and
exhaustion
if
i
had
been
there
i
should
have
looked
the
other
way
so
as
not
to
see
whether
gerald
yielded
himself
to
the
same
abandonment
the
newcomer
he
appeared
to
be
a
gamekeeper
gerald
decided
later
looked
down
on
well
certainly
on
mabel
and
said
come
on
do
be
a
little
duffer
he
may
have
said
a
couple
of
little
duffers
who
is
it
and
what
it
all
about
i
ca
possibly
tell
you
gerald
panted
we
shall
have
to
see
about
that
sha
we
said
the
newcomer
amiably
come
out
into
the
moonlight
and
let
review
the
situation
gerald
even
in
that
state
of
his
world
found
time
to
think
that
a
gamekeeper
who
used
such
words
as
that
had
most
likely
a
romantic
past
but
at
the
same
time
he
saw
that
such
a
man
would
be
far
less
easy
to
square
with
an
unconvincing
tale
than
eliza
or
johnson
or
even
mademoiselle
in
fact
he
seemed
with
the
only
tale
that
they
had
to
tell
practically
unsquarable
gerald
got
up
if
he
was
not
up
already
or
still
up
and
pulled
at
the
limp
and
now
hot
hand
of
the
sobbing
mabel
and
as
he
did
so
the
unsquarable
one
took
hand
and
thus
led
both
children
out
from
under
the
shadow
of
flora
dome
into
the
bright
white
moonlight
that
carpeted
flora
steps
here
he
sat
down
a
child
on
each
side
of
him
drew
a
hand
of
each
through
his
velveteen
arm
pressed
them
to
his
velveteen
sides
in
a
friendly
reassuring
way
and
said
now
then
go
ahead
mabel
merely
sobbed
we
must
excuse
her
she
had
been
very
brave
and
i
have
no
doubt
that
all
heroines
from
joan
of
arc
to
grace
darling
have
had
their
sobbing
moments
but
gerald
said
it
no
use
if
i
made
up
a
story
you
see
through
it
that
a
compliment
to
my
discernment
anyhow
said
the
stranger
what
price
telling
me
the
truth
if
we
told
you
the
truth
said
gerald
you
would
believe
it
try
me
said
the
velveteen
one
he
was
and
had
large
eyes
that
sparkled
when
the
moonlight
touched
them
i
said
gerald
and
it
was
plain
that
he
spoke
the
truth
you
either
think
we
were
mad
and
get
us
shut
up
or
else
oh
no
good
thank
you
for
helping
us
and
do
let
us
go
home
i
wonder
said
the
stranger
musingly
whether
you
have
any
imagination
considering
that
we
invented
them
gerald
hotly
began
and
stopped
with
late
prudence
if
by
you
mean
the
people
whom
i
helped
you
to
imprison
in
yonder
tomb
said
the
stranger
loosing
mabel
hand
to
put
his
arm
round
her
remember
that
i
saw
and
heard
them
and
with
all
respect
to
your
imagination
i
doubt
whether
any
invention
of
yours
would
be
quite
so
convincing
gerald
put
his
elbows
on
his
knees
and
his
chin
in
his
hands
collect
yourself
said
the
one
in
velveteen
and
while
you
are
collecting
let
me
just
put
the
thing
from
my
point
of
view
i
think
you
hardly
realise
my
position
i
come
down
from
london
to
take
care
of
a
big
estate
i
you
were
a
gamekeeper
put
in
gerald
mabel
put
her
head
on
the
stranger
shoulder
hero
in
disguise
then
know
she
sniffed
not
at
all
said
he
bailiff
would
be
nearer
the
mark
on
the
very
first
evening
i
go
out
to
take
the
moonlit
air
and
approaching
a
white
building
hear
sounds
of
an
agitated
scuffle
accompanied
by
frenzied
appeals
for
assistance
carried
away
by
the
enthusiasm
of
the
moment
i
assist
and
shut
up
goodness
knows
who
behind
a
stone
door
now
is
it
unreasonable
that
i
should
ask
who
it
is
that
i
shut
up
helped
to
shut
up
i
mean
and
who
it
is
that
i
assisted
it
reasonable
enough
gerald
admitted
well
then
said
the
stranger
well
then
said
gerald
the
fact
is
no
he
added
after
a
pause
the
fact
is
i
simply
ca
tell
you
then
i
must
ask
the
other
side
said
velveteens
let
me
go
i
undo
that
door
and
find
out
for
myself
tell
him
said
mabel
speaking
for
the
first
time
never
mind
if
he
believes
or
not
we
ca
have
them
let
out
very
well
said
gerald
i
tell
him
now
look
here
bailiff
will
you
promise
us
on
an
english
gentleman
word
of
honour
because
of
course
i
can
see
you
bailiff
or
not
will
you
promise
that
you
wo
tell
any
one
what
we
tell
you
and
that
you
wo
have
us
put
in
a
lunatic
asylum
however
mad
we
sound
yes
said
the
stranger
i
think
i
can
promise
that
but
if
been
having
a
sham
fight
or
anything
and
shoved
the
other
side
into
that
hole
do
you
think
you
better
let
them
out
they
be
most
awfully
frightened
you
know
after
all
i
suppose
they
are
only
children
wait
till
you
hear
gerald
answered
they
not
children
not
much
shall
i
just
tell
about
them
or
begin
at
the
beginning
the
beginning
of
course
said
the
stranger
mabel
lifted
her
head
from
his
velveteen
shoulder
and
said
let
me
begin
then
i
found
a
ring
and
i
said
it
would
make
me
invisible
i
said
it
in
play
and
it
i
was
invisible
hours
never
mind
where
i
got
the
ring
now
gerald
you
go
on
gerald
went
on
for
quite
a
long
time
he
went
on
for
the
story
was
a
splendid
one
to
tell
and
so
he
ended
we
got
them
in
there
and
when
seven
hours
are
over
or
fourteen
or
or
something
with
a
seven
in
it
they
just
be
old
coats
again
they
came
alive
at
nine
think
they
stop
being
it
in
seven
hours
that
four
will
you
let
us
go
home
i
see
you
home
said
the
stranger
in
a
quite
new
tone
of
exasperating
gentleness
come
let
be
going
you
do
believe
us
said
gerald
of
course
you
do
nobody
could
but
i
could
make
you
believe
if
i
chose
all
three
stood
up
and
the
stranger
stared
in
gerald
eyes
till
gerald
answered
his
thought
no
i
do
look
mad
do
i
no
you
are
but
come
you
an
extraordinarily
sensible
boy
do
you
think
you
may
be
sickening
for
a
fever
or
something
and
cathy
and
jimmy
and
mademoiselle
and
eliza
and
the
man
who
said
fawkes
swelp
me
and
you
saw
them
move
you
heard
them
call
out
are
you
sickening
for
anything
no
or
at
least
not
for
anything
but
information
come
and
i
see
you
home
mabel
lives
at
the
towers
said
gerald
as
the
stranger
turned
into
the
broad
drive
that
leads
to
the
big
gate
no
relation
to
lord
yalding
said
mabel
hastily
niece
she
was
holding
on
to
his
hand
all
the
way
at
the
entrance
she
put
up
her
face
to
be
kissed
and
went
in
poor
little
thing
said
the
bailiff
as
they
went
down
the
drive
towards
the
gate
he
went
with
gerald
to
the
door
of
the
school
look
here
said
gerald
at
parting
i
know
what
you
going
to
do
you
going
to
try
to
undo
that
door
discerning
said
the
stranger
well
do
or
any
way
wait
till
daylight
and
let
us
be
there
we
can
get
there
by
ten
all
right
i
meet
you
there
by
ten
answered
the
stranger
by
george
you
the
rummest
kids
i
ever
met
we
are
rum
gerald
owned
but
so
would
you
be
if
good
night
as
the
four
children
went
over
the
smooth
lawn
towards
flora
temple
they
talked
as
they
had
talked
all
the
morning
about
the
adventures
of
last
night
and
of
mabel
bravery
it
was
not
ten
but
twelve
for
eliza
backed
by
mademoiselle
had
insisted
on
their
clearing
up
and
clearing
up
very
thoroughly
the
litter
of
last
night
you
a
victoria
cross
heroine
dear
said
cathy
warmly
you
ought
to
have
a
statue
put
up
to
you
it
would
come
alive
if
you
put
it
here
said
gerald
grimly
should
have
been
afraid
said
jimmy
by
daylight
gerald
assured
him
everything
looks
so
jolly
different
i
do
hope
he
be
there
mabel
said
he
such
a
dear
cathy
a
perfect
bailiff
with
the
soul
of
a
gentleman
illustration
a
painted
pointed
paper
face
peered
out
he
is
there
though
said
jimmy
i
believe
you
just
dreamed
him
like
you
did
the
statues
coming
alive
they
went
up
the
marble
steps
in
the
sunshine
and
it
was
difficult
to
believe
that
this
was
the
place
where
only
in
last
night
moonlight
fear
had
laid
such
cold
hands
on
the
hearts
of
mabel
and
gerald
shall
we
open
the
door
suggested
kathleen
and
begin
to
carry
home
the
coats
let
listen
first
said
gerald
perhaps
they
are
only
coats
yet
they
laid
ears
to
the
hinges
of
the
stone
door
behind
which
last
night
the
had
shrieked
and
threatened
all
was
still
as
the
sweet
morning
itself
it
was
as
they
turned
away
that
they
saw
the
man
they
had
come
to
meet
he
was
on
the
other
side
of
flora
pedestal
but
he
was
not
standing
up
he
lay
there
quite
still
on
his
back
his
arms
flung
wide
oh
look
cried
cathy
and
pointed
his
face
was
a
queer
greenish
colour
and
on
his
forehead
there
was
a
cut
its
edges
were
blue
and
a
little
blood
had
trickled
from
it
on
to
the
white
of
the
marble
at
the
same
time
mabel
pointed
too
but
she
did
not
cry
out
as
cathy
had
done
and
what
she
pointed
at
was
a
big
rhododendron
bush
from
which
a
painted
pointed
paper
face
peered
out
very
white
very
red
in
the
sunlight
and
as
the
children
gazed
shrank
back
into
the
cover
of
the
shining
leaves
chapter
viii
it
was
but
too
plain
the
unfortunate
bailiff
must
have
opened
the
door
before
the
spell
had
faded
while
yet
the
were
something
more
than
mere
coats
and
hats
and
sticks
they
had
rushed
out
upon
him
and
had
done
this
he
lay
there
insensible
was
it
a
or
a
that
had
made
that
horrible
cut
on
his
forehead
gerald
wondered
the
girls
had
rushed
to
the
sufferer
already
his
head
was
in
mabel
lap
kathleen
had
tried
to
get
it
on
to
hers
but
mabel
was
too
quick
for
her
jimmy
and
gerald
both
knew
what
was
the
first
thing
needed
by
the
unconscious
even
before
mabel
impatiently
said
water
water
what
in
jimmy
asked
looking
doubtfully
at
his
hands
and
then
down
the
green
slope
to
the
pool
where
the
were
your
hat
anything
said
mabel
the
two
boys
turned
away
suppose
they
come
after
us
said
jimmy
come
after
us
gerald
snapped
rather
than
asked
the
jimmy
whispered
who
afraid
gerald
inquired
but
he
looked
to
right
and
left
very
carefully
and
chose
the
way
that
did
not
lead
near
the
bushes
he
scooped
water
up
in
his
straw
hat
and
returned
to
flora
temple
carrying
it
carefully
in
both
hands
when
he
saw
how
quickly
it
ran
through
the
straw
he
pulled
his
handkerchief
from
his
breast
pocket
with
his
teeth
and
dropped
it
into
the
hat
it
was
with
this
that
the
girls
wiped
the
blood
from
the
bailiff
brow
we
ought
to
have
smelling
salts
said
kathleen
half
in
tears
i
know
we
ought
they
would
be
good
mabel
owned
has
your
aunt
any
yes
but
do
be
a
coward
said
gerald
think
of
last
night
hurt
you
he
must
have
insulted
them
or
something
look
here
you
run
we
see
that
nothing
runs
after
you
there
was
no
choice
but
to
relinquish
the
head
of
the
interesting
invalid
to
kathleen
so
mabel
did
it
cast
one
glaring
glance
round
the
rhododendron
bordered
slope
and
fled
towards
the
castle
the
other
three
bent
over
the
still
unconscious
bailiff
he
not
dead
is
he
asked
jimmy
anxiously
no
kathleen
reassured
him
his
heart
beating
mabel
and
i
felt
it
in
his
wrist
where
doctors
do
how
frightfully
he
is
not
so
dusty
gerald
admitted
i
never
know
what
you
mean
by
said
jimmy
and
suddenly
a
shadow
fell
on
the
marble
beside
them
and
a
fourth
voice
spoke
not
mabel
her
hurrying
figure
though
still
in
sight
was
far
away
quite
a
personable
young
man
it
said
the
children
looked
up
into
the
face
of
the
eldest
of
the
the
respectable
one
jimmy
and
kathleen
screamed
i
am
sorry
but
they
did
hush
said
gerald
savagely
he
was
still
wearing
the
ring
hold
your
tongues
i
get
him
away
he
added
in
a
whisper
very
sad
affair
this
said
the
respectable
he
spoke
with
a
curious
accent
there
was
something
odd
about
his
r
and
his
m
and
n
were
those
of
a
person
labouring
under
an
almost
intolerable
cold
in
the
head
but
it
was
not
the
dreadful
oo
and
ah
voice
of
the
night
before
kathleen
and
jimmy
stooped
over
the
bailiff
even
that
prostrate
form
being
human
seemed
some
little
protection
but
gerald
strong
in
the
fearlessness
that
the
ring
gave
to
its
wearer
looked
full
into
the
face
of
the
and
started
for
though
the
face
was
almost
the
same
as
the
face
he
had
himself
painted
on
the
school
it
was
not
the
same
for
it
was
no
longer
paper
it
was
a
real
face
and
the
hands
lean
and
almost
transparent
as
they
were
were
real
hands
as
it
moved
a
little
to
get
a
better
view
of
the
bailiff
it
was
plain
that
it
had
legs
arms
live
legs
and
arms
and
a
backbone
it
was
alive
indeed
with
a
vengeance
how
did
it
happen
gerald
asked
with
an
effort
at
calmness
a
successful
effort
most
regrettable
said
the
the
others
must
have
missed
the
way
last
night
in
the
passage
they
never
found
the
hotel
did
asked
gerald
blankly
of
course
said
the
most
respectable
exactly
as
you
said
then
when
i
came
away
i
did
come
the
front
way
because
i
wanted
to
revisit
this
sylvan
scene
by
daylight
and
the
hotel
people
did
seem
to
know
how
to
direct
me
to
it
i
found
the
others
all
at
this
door
very
angry
they
been
here
all
night
trying
to
get
out
then
the
door
opened
this
gentleman
must
have
opened
it
and
before
i
could
protect
him
that
underbred
man
in
the
high
hat
you
remember
gerald
remembered
hit
him
on
the
head
and
he
fell
where
you
see
him
the
others
dispersed
and
i
myself
was
just
going
for
assistance
when
i
saw
you
here
jimmy
was
discovered
to
be
in
tears
and
kathleen
white
as
any
what
the
matter
my
little
man
said
the
respectable
kindly
jimmy
passed
instantly
from
tears
to
yells
here
take
the
ring
said
gerald
in
a
furious
whisper
and
thrust
it
on
to
jimmy
hot
damp
resisting
finger
jimmy
voice
stopped
short
in
the
middle
of
a
howl
and
gerald
in
a
cold
flash
realised
what
it
was
that
mabel
had
gone
through
the
night
before
but
it
was
daylight
and
gerald
was
not
a
coward
we
must
find
the
others
he
said
i
imagine
said
the
elderly
that
they
have
gone
to
bathe
their
clothes
are
in
the
wood
he
pointed
stiffly
you
two
go
and
see
said
gerald
i
go
on
dabbing
this
head
in
the
wood
jimmy
now
fearless
as
any
lion
discovered
four
heaps
of
clothing
with
broomsticks
and
masks
complete
all
that
had
gone
to
make
up
the
gentlemen
of
the
night
before
on
a
stone
seat
well
in
the
sun
sat
the
two
lady
and
kathleen
approached
them
gingerly
valour
is
easier
in
the
sunshine
than
at
night
as
we
all
know
when
she
and
jimmy
came
close
to
the
bench
they
saw
that
the
were
only
such
as
they
had
often
made
there
was
no
life
in
them
jimmy
shook
them
to
pieces
and
a
sigh
of
relief
burst
from
kathleen
the
spell
broken
you
see
she
said
and
that
old
gentleman
real
he
only
happens
to
be
like
the
we
made
he
got
the
coat
that
hung
in
the
hall
on
anyway
said
jimmy
illustration
jimmy
shook
them
to
pieces
no
it
only
like
it
let
get
back
to
the
unconscious
stranger
they
did
and
gerald
begged
the
elderly
to
retire
among
the
bushes
with
jimmy
because
said
he
i
think
the
poor
coming
round
and
it
might
upset
him
to
see
strangers
and
jimmy
keep
you
company
he
the
best
one
of
us
to
go
with
you
he
added
hastily
and
this
since
jimmy
had
the
ring
was
certainly
true
so
the
two
disappeared
behind
the
rhododendrons
mabel
came
back
with
the
salts
just
as
the
bailiff
opened
his
eyes
it
just
like
life
she
said
i
might
just
as
well
not
have
gone
however
she
knelt
down
at
once
and
held
the
bottle
under
the
sufferer
nose
till
he
sneezed
and
feebly
pushed
her
hand
away
with
the
faint
question
what
up
now
you
hurt
your
head
said
gerald
lie
still
no
more
he
said
weakly
and
lay
quite
soon
he
sat
up
and
looked
round
him
there
was
an
anxious
silence
here
was
a
who
knew
last
night
secret
and
none
of
the
children
were
at
all
sure
what
the
utmost
rigour
of
the
law
might
be
in
a
case
where
people
no
matter
how
young
made
and
brought
them
to
life
dangerous
fighting
angry
life
what
would
he
say
what
would
he
do
he
said
what
an
odd
thing
have
i
been
insensible
long
hours
said
mabel
earnestly
not
long
said
kathleen
we
do
know
we
found
you
like
it
said
gerald
i
all
right
now
said
the
bailiff
and
his
eye
fell
on
the
handkerchief
i
say
i
did
give
my
head
a
bang
and
you
been
giving
me
first
aid
thank
you
most
awfully
but
it
is
rum
what
rum
politeness
obliged
gerald
to
ask
well
i
suppose
it
is
really
rum
i
expect
i
saw
you
just
before
i
fainted
or
whatever
it
was
but
i
dreamed
the
most
extraordinary
dream
while
i
been
insensible
and
you
were
in
it
nothing
but
us
asked
mabel
breathlessly
oh
lots
of
things
impossible
things
but
were
real
enough
every
one
breathed
deeply
in
relief
it
was
indeed
as
they
agreed
later
a
lucky
are
you
you
all
right
they
all
asked
as
he
got
on
his
feet
perfectly
thank
you
he
glanced
behind
flora
statue
as
he
spoke
do
you
know
i
dreamed
there
was
a
door
there
but
of
course
there
is
i
do
know
how
to
thank
you
he
added
looking
at
them
with
what
the
girls
called
his
beautiful
kind
eyes
it
lucky
for
me
you
came
along
you
come
here
whenever
you
like
you
know
he
added
i
give
you
the
freedom
of
the
place
you
the
new
bailiff
are
you
said
mabel
yes
how
did
you
know
he
asked
quickly
but
they
did
not
tell
him
how
they
knew
instead
they
found
out
which
way
he
was
going
and
went
the
other
way
after
warm
and
hopes
on
both
sides
that
they
would
meet
again
soon
i
tell
you
what
said
gerald
as
they
watched
the
tall
broad
figure
of
the
bailiff
grow
smaller
across
the
hot
green
of
the
grass
slope
have
you
got
any
idea
of
how
we
going
to
spend
the
day
because
i
have
the
others
had
we
get
rid
of
that
oh
we
find
a
way
right
enough
and
directly
we
done
it
we
go
home
and
seal
up
the
ring
in
an
envelope
so
that
its
teeth
be
drawn
and
it
be
powerless
to
have
unforeseen
larks
with
us
then
we
get
out
on
the
roof
and
have
a
quiet
day
books
and
apples
i
about
fed
up
with
adventures
so
i
tell
you
the
others
told
him
the
same
thing
now
said
he
think
as
you
never
thought
before
how
to
get
rid
of
that
every
one
thought
but
their
brains
were
tired
with
anxiety
and
distress
and
the
thoughts
they
thought
were
as
mabel
said
not
worth
thinking
let
alone
saying
i
suppose
jimmy
all
right
said
kathleen
anxiously
oh
all
right
he
got
the
ring
said
gerald
i
hope
he
wo
go
wishing
anything
rotten
said
mabel
but
gerald
urged
her
to
shut
up
and
let
him
think
i
think
i
think
best
sitting
down
he
said
and
sat
and
sometimes
you
can
think
best
aloud
the
do
make
any
mistake
about
that
and
he
got
made
real
inside
that
passage
if
we
could
get
him
back
there
he
might
get
changed
again
and
then
we
could
take
the
coats
and
things
back
is
there
any
other
way
kathleen
asked
and
mabel
more
candid
said
bluntly
i
not
going
into
that
passage
so
there
afraid
in
broad
daylight
gerald
sneered
it
would
be
broad
daylight
in
there
said
mabel
and
kathleen
shivered
if
we
went
to
him
and
suddenly
tore
his
coat
off
said
she
he
only
coats
he
could
go
on
being
real
then
he
said
gerald
you
do
know
what
he
like
under
the
coat
kathleen
shivered
again
and
all
this
time
the
sun
was
shining
gaily
and
the
white
statues
and
the
green
trees
and
the
fountains
and
terraces
looked
as
cheerfully
romantic
as
a
scene
in
a
play
any
way
said
gerald
we
try
to
get
him
back
and
shut
the
door
that
the
most
we
can
hope
for
and
then
apples
and
or
the
family
or
any
book
you
like
that
got
no
magic
in
it
now
we
just
got
to
do
it
and
he
not
horrid
now
he
is
he
real
you
see
i
suppose
that
makes
all
the
difference
said
mabel
and
tried
to
feel
that
perhaps
it
did
and
it
broad
daylight
just
look
at
the
sun
gerald
insisted
come
on
he
took
a
hand
of
each
and
they
walked
resolutely
towards
the
bank
of
rhododendrons
behind
which
jimmy
and
the
had
been
told
to
wait
and
as
they
went
gerald
said
he
real
the
shining
it
all
be
over
in
a
minute
and
he
said
these
things
again
and
again
so
that
there
should
be
no
mistake
about
them
as
they
neared
the
bushes
the
shining
leaves
rustled
shivered
and
parted
and
before
the
girls
had
time
to
begin
to
hang
back
jimmy
came
blinking
out
into
the
sunlight
the
boughs
closed
behind
him
and
they
did
not
stir
or
rustle
for
the
appearance
of
any
one
else
jimmy
was
alone
where
is
it
asked
the
girls
in
one
breath
walking
up
and
down
in
a
said
jimmy
doing
sums
in
a
book
he
says
he
most
frightfully
rich
and
he
got
to
get
up
to
town
to
the
stocks
or
something
where
they
change
papers
into
gold
if
clever
he
says
i
should
like
to
go
to
the
you
i
do
seem
to
care
very
much
about
changes
said
gerald
i
had
enough
show
us
where
he
is
we
must
get
rid
of
him
he
got
a
jimmy
went
on
parting
the
warm
rhododendron
leaves
and
a
garden
with
a
and
a
lake
and
a
carriage
and
pair
and
he
goes
to
athens
for
his
holiday
sometimes
just
like
other
people
go
to
margate
the
best
thing
said
gerald
following
through
the
bushes
will
be
to
tell
him
the
shortest
way
out
is
through
that
hotel
that
he
thinks
he
found
last
night
then
we
get
him
into
the
passage
give
him
a
push
fly
back
and
shut
the
door
he
starve
to
death
in
there
said
kathleen
if
he
really
real
i
expect
it
does
last
long
the
ring
magics
do
anyway
it
the
only
thing
i
can
think
of
he
frightfully
rich
jimmy
went
on
unheeding
amid
the
cracking
of
the
bushes
he
building
a
public
library
for
the
people
where
he
lives
and
having
his
portrait
painted
to
put
in
it
he
thinks
like
that
the
belt
of
rhododendrons
was
passed
and
the
children
had
reached
a
smooth
grass
walk
bordered
by
tall
pines
and
firs
of
strange
different
kinds
he
just
round
that
corner
said
jimmy
he
simply
rolling
in
money
he
does
know
what
to
do
with
it
he
been
building
a
and
drinking
fountain
with
a
bust
of
himself
on
top
why
does
he
build
a
private
close
to
his
bed
so
that
he
can
just
roll
off
into
it
of
a
morning
i
wish
was
rich
i
soon
show
him
that
a
sensible
wish
said
gerald
i
wonder
we
did
think
of
doing
that
oh
criky
he
added
and
with
reason
for
there
in
the
green
shadows
of
the
in
the
woodland
silence
broken
only
by
rustling
leaves
and
the
agitated
breathing
of
the
three
unhappy
others
jimmy
got
his
wish
by
quick
but
perfectly
degrees
jimmy
became
rich
and
the
horrible
thing
was
that
though
they
could
see
it
happening
they
did
not
know
what
was
happening
and
could
not
have
stopped
it
if
they
had
all
they
could
see
was
jimmy
their
own
jimmy
whom
they
had
larked
with
and
quarrelled
with
and
made
it
up
with
ever
since
they
could
remember
jimmy
continuously
and
horribly
growing
old
the
whole
thing
was
over
in
a
few
seconds
yet
in
those
few
seconds
they
saw
him
grow
to
a
youth
a
young
man
a
man
and
then
with
a
sort
of
shivering
shock
unspeakably
horrible
and
definite
he
seemed
to
settle
down
into
an
elderly
gentleman
handsomely
but
rather
dowdily
dressed
who
was
looking
down
at
them
through
spectacles
and
asking
them
the
nearest
way
to
the
if
they
had
not
seen
the
change
take
place
in
all
its
awful
details
they
would
never
have
guessed
that
this
stout
prosperous
elderly
gentleman
with
the
high
hat
the
and
the
large
red
seal
dangling
from
the
curve
of
a
portly
waistcoat
was
their
own
jimmy
but
as
they
seen
it
they
knew
the
dreadful
truth
oh
jimmy
cried
mabel
desperately
gerald
said
this
is
perfectly
beastly
and
kathleen
broke
into
wild
weeping
do
cry
little
girl
said
and
you
boy
ca
you
give
a
civil
answer
to
a
civil
question
he
does
know
us
wailed
kathleen
who
does
know
you
said
impatiently
y
y
do
kathleen
sobbed
i
certainly
do
returned
but
surely
that
need
not
distress
you
so
deeply
oh
jimmy
jimmy
jimmy
kathleen
sobbed
louder
than
before
he
know
us
gerald
owned
or
look
here
jimmy
y
you
are
kidding
are
you
because
if
you
are
it
simply
abject
rot
my
name
is
said
and
gave
the
name
correctly
by
the
way
it
will
perhaps
be
shorter
to
call
this
elderly
stout
person
who
was
jimmy
grown
rich
by
some
simpler
name
than
i
have
just
used
let
us
call
him
that
short
for
what
we
to
do
whispered
mabel
awestruck
and
aloud
she
said
oh
james
or
whatever
you
call
yourself
give
me
the
ring
for
on
that
finger
the
fatal
ring
showed
plain
certainly
not
said
that
firmly
you
appear
to
be
a
very
grasping
child
but
what
are
you
going
to
gerald
asked
in
the
flat
tones
of
complete
hopelessness
your
interest
is
very
flattering
said
that
will
you
tell
me
or
wo
you
the
way
to
the
nearest
no
said
gerald
we
wo
then
said
that
still
politely
though
quite
plainly
furious
perhaps
you
tell
me
the
way
to
the
nearest
lunatic
asylum
oh
no
no
no
cried
kathleen
you
not
so
bad
as
that
perhaps
not
but
are
that
retorted
if
you
not
lunatics
you
idiots
however
i
see
a
gentleman
ahead
who
is
perhaps
sane
in
fact
i
seem
to
recognise
him
a
gentleman
indeed
was
now
to
be
seen
approaching
it
was
the
elderly
oh
do
you
remember
jerry
kathleen
cried
and
cathy
your
own
cathy
puss
cat
dear
dear
jimmy
be
so
silly
little
girl
said
that
looking
at
her
crossly
through
his
spectacles
i
am
sorry
you
have
not
been
better
brought
up
and
he
walked
stiffly
towards
the
two
hats
were
raised
a
few
words
were
exchanged
and
two
elderly
figures
walked
side
by
side
down
the
green
followed
by
three
miserable
children
horrified
bewildered
alarmed
and
what
is
really
worse
than
anything
quite
at
their
end
he
wished
to
be
rich
so
of
course
he
is
said
gerald
he
have
money
for
tickets
and
everything
illustration
two
hats
were
raised
and
when
the
spell
breaks
it
sure
to
break
is
it
he
find
himself
somewhere
awful
perhaps
in
a
really
good
hotel
and
not
know
how
he
got
there
i
wonder
how
long
the
lasted
said
mabel
yes
gerald
answered
that
reminds
me
you
two
collect
the
coats
and
things
hide
them
anywhere
you
like
and
we
carry
them
home
if
there
any
he
added
darkly
oh
do
said
kathleen
once
more
breathing
heavily
on
the
verge
of
tears
you
would
think
everything
be
so
awful
and
the
sun
shining
like
it
does
look
here
said
gerald
of
course
i
must
stick
to
jimmy
you
two
must
go
home
to
mademoiselle
and
tell
her
jimmy
and
i
have
gone
off
in
the
train
with
a
gentleman
say
he
looked
like
an
uncle
he
does
some
kinds
of
uncle
there
be
a
beastly
row
afterwards
but
it
got
to
be
done
it
all
seems
thick
with
lies
said
kathleen
you
do
seem
to
be
able
to
get
a
word
of
truth
in
edgewise
hardly
do
you
worry
said
her
brother
they
are
lies
they
as
true
as
anything
else
in
this
magic
rot
we
got
mixed
up
in
it
like
telling
lies
in
a
dream
you
ca
help
it
well
all
i
know
is
i
wish
it
would
stop
lot
of
use
your
wishing
is
said
gerald
exasperated
so
long
i
to
go
and
you
to
stay
if
it
any
comfort
to
you
i
do
believe
of
it
real
it
ca
be
it
too
thick
tell
mademoiselle
jimmy
and
i
will
be
back
to
tea
if
we
do
happen
to
be
i
ca
help
it
i
ca
help
except
perhaps
jimmy
he
started
to
run
for
the
girls
had
lagged
and
the
and
that
late
jimmy
had
quickened
their
pace
the
girls
were
left
looking
after
them
we
to
find
these
clothes
said
mabel
simply
got
to
i
used
to
want
to
be
a
heroine
it
different
when
it
really
comes
to
being
is
it
yes
very
said
kathleen
where
shall
we
hide
the
clothes
when
got
them
not
not
that
passage
never
said
mabel
firmly
we
hide
them
inside
the
great
stone
dinosaurus
he
hollow
he
comes
alive
in
his
stone
said
kathleen
not
in
the
sunshine
he
does
mabel
told
her
confidently
and
not
without
the
ring
there
wo
be
any
apples
and
books
said
kathleen
no
but
we
do
the
babiest
thing
we
do
the
minute
we
get
home
we
have
a
dolls
that
make
us
feel
as
if
there
really
any
magic
it
have
to
be
a
very
strong
tea
party
then
said
kathleen
doubtfully
and
now
we
see
gerald
a
small
but
quite
determined
figure
paddling
along
in
the
soft
white
dust
of
the
sunny
road
in
the
wake
of
two
elderly
gentlemen
his
hand
in
his
trousers
pocket
buries
itself
with
a
feeling
of
satisfaction
in
the
heavy
mixed
coinage
that
is
his
share
of
the
profits
of
his
conjuring
at
the
fair
his
noiseless
bear
him
to
the
station
where
unobserved
he
listens
at
the
ticket
office
to
the
voice
of
one
first
london
it
says
and
gerald
waiting
till
that
and
the
have
strolled
on
to
the
platform
politely
conversing
of
politics
and
the
kaffir
market
takes
a
third
return
to
london
the
train
strides
in
squeaking
and
puffing
the
watched
take
their
seats
in
a
carriage
the
watcher
springs
into
a
yellow
wooden
compartment
a
whistle
sounds
a
flag
is
waved
the
train
pulls
itself
together
strains
jerks
and
starts

mabel
hands
up
the
clothes
and
the
sticks
i
do
understand
says
gerald
alone
in
his
carriage
how
railway
trains
and
magic
go
on
at
the
same
time
and
yet
they
do
mabel
and
kathleen
nervously
peering
among
the
rhododendron
bushes
and
the
bracken
and
the
fancy
find
six
several
heaps
of
coats
hats
skirts
gloves
they
carry
them
panting
and
damp
for
the
sun
is
pitiless
up
the
hill
to
where
the
stone
dinosaurus
looms
immense
among
a
forest
of
larches
the
dinosaurus
has
a
hole
in
his
stomach
kathleen
shows
mabel
how
to
make
a
back
and
climbs
up
on
it
into
the
cold
stony
inside
of
the
monster
mabel
hands
up
the
clothes
and
the
sticks
there
lots
of
room
says
kathleen
its
tail
goes
down
into
the
ground
it
like
a
secret
passage
suppose
something
comes
out
of
it
and
jumps
out
at
you
says
mabel
and
kathleen
hurriedly
descends
the
explanations
to
mademoiselle
promise
to
be
difficult
but
as
kathleen
said
afterwards
any
little
thing
is
enough
to
take
a
attention
off
a
figure
passes
the
window
just
as
they
are
explaining
that
it
really
did
look
exactly
like
an
uncle
that
the
boys
have
gone
to
london
with
who
that
says
mademoiselle
suddenly
pointing
too
which
every
one
knows
is
not
manners
it
is
the
bailiff
coming
back
from
the
doctor
with
antiseptic
plaster
on
that
nasty
cut
that
took
so
long
this
morning
they
tell
her
it
is
the
bailiff
at
yalding
towers
and
she
says
sky
and
asks
no
more
awkward
questions
about
the
boys
lunch
very
late
is
a
silent
meal
after
lunch
mademoiselle
goes
out
in
a
hat
with
many
pink
roses
carrying
a
parasol
the
girls
in
dead
silence
organise
a
dolls
with
real
tea
at
the
second
cup
kathleen
bursts
into
tears
mabel
also
weeping
embraces
her
i
wish
sobs
kathleen
oh
i
wish
i
knew
where
the
boys
were
it
be
such
a
comfort
gerald
knew
where
the
boys
were
and
it
was
no
comfort
to
him
at
all
if
you
come
to
think
of
it
he
was
the
only
person
who
could
know
where
they
were
because
jimmy
did
know
that
he
was
a
boy
and
indeed
he
was
really
and
the
could
be
expected
to
know
anything
real
such
as
where
boys
were
at
the
moment
when
the
second
cup
of
dolls
tea
very
strong
but
not
strong
enough
to
drown
care
in
was
being
poured
out
by
the
trembling
hand
of
kathleen
gerald
was
lurking
there
really
is
no
other
word
for
it
on
the
staircase
of
aldermanbury
buildings
old
broad
street
on
the
floor
below
him
was
a
door
bearing
the
legend
ugli
stock
and
share
broker
and
at
the
stock
exchange
and
on
the
floor
above
was
another
door
on
which
was
the
name
of
gerald
little
brother
now
grown
suddenly
rich
in
so
magic
and
tragic
a
way
there
were
no
explaining
words
under
name
gerald
could
not
guess
what
walk
in
life
it
was
to
which
that
which
had
been
jimmy
owed
its
affluence
he
had
seen
when
the
door
opened
to
admit
his
brother
a
tangle
of
clerks
and
mahogany
desks
evidently
that
had
a
large
business
what
was
gerald
to
do
what
he
do
it
is
almost
impossible
especially
for
one
so
young
as
gerald
to
enter
a
large
london
office
and
explain
that
the
elderly
and
respected
head
of
it
is
not
what
he
seems
but
is
really
your
little
brother
who
has
been
suddenly
advanced
to
age
and
wealth
by
a
tricky
wishing
ring
if
you
think
it
a
possible
thing
try
it
that
all
nor
could
he
knock
at
the
door
of
ugli
stock
and
share
broker
and
at
the
stock
exchange
and
inform
clerks
that
their
chief
was
really
nothing
but
old
clothes
that
had
accidentally
come
alive
and
by
some
magic
which
he
could
attempt
to
explain
become
real
during
a
night
spent
at
a
really
good
hotel
which
had
no
existence
the
situation
bristled
as
you
see
with
difficulties
and
it
was
so
long
past
gerald
proper
that
his
increasing
hunger
was
rapidly
growing
to
seem
the
most
important
difficulty
of
all
it
is
quite
possible
to
starve
to
death
on
the
staircase
of
a
london
building
if
the
people
you
are
watching
for
only
stay
long
enough
in
their
offices
the
truth
of
this
came
home
to
gerald
more
and
more
painfully
a
boy
with
hair
like
a
new
front
door
mat
came
whistling
up
the
stairs
he
had
a
dark
blue
bag
in
his
hands
i
give
you
a
tanner
for
yourself
if
you
get
me
a
tanner
worth
of
buns
said
gerald
with
that
prompt
decision
common
to
all
great
commanders
show
us
yer
tanners
the
boy
rejoined
with
at
least
equal
promptness
gerald
showed
them
all
right
hand
over
payment
on
delivery
said
gerald
using
words
from
the
drapers
which
he
had
never
thought
to
use
the
boy
grinned
admiringly
knows
wy
abaht
he
said
ai
no
flies
on
not
many
gerald
owned
with
modest
pride
cut
along
there
a
good
chap
i
to
wait
here
i
take
care
of
your
bag
if
you
like
nor
yet
there
ai
no
flies
on
me
neither
remarked
the
boy
shouldering
it
i
been
up
to
the
confidence
trick
for
years
ever
since
i
was
your
age
with
this
parting
shot
he
went
and
returned
in
due
course
gerald
gave
the
sixpence
and
took
the
buns
when
the
boy
a
minute
later
emerged
from
the
door
of
ugli
stock
and
share
broker
and
at
the
stock
exchange
gerald
stopped
him
what
sort
of
chap
that
he
asked
pointing
the
question
with
a
jerk
of
an
explaining
thumb
awful
big
pot
said
the
boy
up
to
his
eyes
in
oof
motor
and
all
that
know
anything
about
the
one
on
the
next
landing
he
bigger
than
what
this
one
is
very
old
firm
special
cellar
in
the
bank
of
england
to
put
his
chink
in
all
in
bins
like
against
the
wall
at
the
jimminy
i
would
mind
an
hour
in
there
and
the
doors
open
and
the
police
away
at
a
beano
not
much
neither
you
bust
if
you
eat
all
them
buns
have
one
gerald
responded
and
held
out
the
bag
they
say
in
our
office
said
the
boy
paying
for
the
bun
honourably
with
unasked
information
as
these
two
is
all
for
cutting
each
throats
oh
only
in
the
way
of
business
been
at
it
for
years
gerald
wildly
wondered
what
magic
and
how
much
had
been
needed
to
give
history
and
a
past
to
these
two
things
of
yesterday
the
rich
jimmy
and
the
if
he
could
get
them
away
would
all
memory
of
them
fade
in
this
boy
mind
for
instance
in
the
minds
of
all
the
people
who
did
business
with
them
in
the
city
would
the
offices
fade
away
were
the
clerks
real
was
the
mahogany
was
he
himself
real
was
the
boy
can
you
keep
a
secret
he
asked
the
other
boy
are
you
on
for
a
lark
i
ought
to
be
getting
back
to
the
office
said
the
boy
get
then
said
gerald
do
you
get
stuffy
said
the
boy
i
was
just
agoing
to
say
it
did
matter
i
know
how
to
make
my
nose
bleed
if
i
a
bit
late
gerald
congratulated
him
on
this
accomplishment
at
once
so
useful
and
so
graceful
and
then
said
look
here
i
give
you
five
bob
honest
what
for
was
the
boy
natural
question
if
you
help
me
fire
ahead
i
a
private
inquiry
said
gerald
you
do
look
it
what
the
good
of
being
one
if
you
look
it
gerald
asked
impatiently
beginning
on
another
bun
that
old
chap
on
the
floor
above
police
asked
the
boy
with
fine
carelessness
no
sorrowing
relations
to
said
the
boy
forgotten
and
forgiven
i
see
and
i
got
to
get
him
to
them
somehow
now
if
you
could
go
in
and
give
him
a
message
from
some
one
who
wanted
to
meet
him
on
business
hold
on
said
the
boy
i
know
a
trick
worth
two
of
that
you
go
in
and
see
old
ugli
he
give
his
ears
to
have
the
old
boy
out
of
the
way
for
a
day
or
two
they
were
saying
so
in
our
office
only
this
morning
let
me
think
said
gerald
laying
down
the
last
bun
on
his
knee
expressly
to
hold
his
head
in
his
hands
do
you
forget
to
think
about
my
five
bob
said
the
boy
then
there
was
a
silence
on
the
stairs
broken
only
by
the
cough
of
a
clerk
in
that
office
and
the
of
a
typewriter
in
the
office
of
ugli
then
gerald
rose
up
and
finished
the
bun
you
right
he
said
i
chance
it
here
your
five
bob
he
brushed
the
bun
crumbs
from
his
front
cleared
his
throat
and
knocked
at
the
door
of
ugli
it
opened
and
he
entered
the
boy
lingered
secure
in
his
power
to
account
for
his
long
absence
by
means
of
his
nose
and
his
waiting
was
rewarded
he
went
down
a
few
steps
round
the
bend
of
the
stairs
and
heard
the
voice
of
ugli
so
well
known
on
that
staircase
and
on
the
stock
exchange
say
in
soft
cautious
accents
then
i
ask
him
to
let
me
look
at
the
ring
and
i
drop
it
you
pick
it
up
but
remember
it
a
pure
accident
and
you
do
know
me
i
ca
have
my
name
mixed
up
in
a
thing
like
this
you
really
unhinged
quite
said
gerald
he
quite
mad
about
that
ring
he
follow
it
anywhere
i
know
he
will
and
think
of
his
sorrowing
relations
i
do
i
do
said
ugli
kindly
that
all
i
think
of
of
course
he
went
up
the
stairs
to
the
other
office
and
gerald
heard
the
voice
of
that
telling
his
clerks
that
he
was
going
out
to
lunch
then
the
horrible
and
jimmy
hardly
less
horrible
in
the
eyes
of
gerald
passed
down
the
stairs
where
in
the
dusk
of
the
lower
landing
two
boys
were
making
themselves
as
undistinguishable
as
possible
and
so
out
into
the
street
talking
of
stocks
and
shares
bears
and
bulls
the
two
boys
followed
i
say
the
boy
whispered
admiringly
whatever
are
you
up
to
you
see
said
gerald
recklessly
come
on
you
tell
me
i
must
be
getting
back
well
i
tell
you
but
you
wo
believe
me
that
old
gentleman
not
really
old
at
all
he
my
young
brother
suddenly
turned
into
what
you
see
the
other
not
real
at
all
he
only
just
old
clothes
and
nothing
inside
he
looks
it
i
must
say
the
boy
admitted
but
i
say
you
do
stick
it
on
do
you
well
my
brother
was
turned
like
that
by
a
magic
ring
there
ai
no
such
thing
as
magic
said
the
boy
i
learnt
that
at
school
all
right
said
gerald
goodbye
oh
go
ahead
said
the
boy
you
do
stick
it
on
though
well
that
magic
ring
if
i
can
get
hold
of
it
i
shall
just
wish
we
were
all
in
a
certain
place
and
we
shall
be
and
then
i
can
deal
with
both
of
them
deal
yes
the
ring
wo
anything
you
wished
that
undoes
itself
with
time
like
a
spring
uncoiling
but
it
give
you
a
wish
i
almost
certain
of
it
anyhow
i
going
to
chance
it
you
are
a
rotter
are
you
said
the
boy
respectfully
you
wait
and
see
gerald
repeated
i
say
you
are
going
into
this
swell
place
you
the
boy
paused
appalled
at
the
majesty
of
pym
yes
i
am
they
ca
turn
us
out
as
long
as
we
behave
you
come
along
too
i
stand
lunch
i
do
know
why
gerald
clung
so
to
this
boy
he
was
a
very
nice
boy
perhaps
it
was
because
he
was
the
only
person
gerald
knew
in
london
to
speak
to
except
and
the
and
he
did
not
want
to
talk
to
either
of
them
what
happened
next
happened
so
quickly
that
as
gerald
said
later
it
was
just
like
magic
the
restaurant
was
crowded
busy
men
were
hastily
bolting
the
food
hurriedly
brought
by
busy
waitresses
there
was
a
clink
of
forks
and
plates
the
gurgle
of
beer
from
bottles
the
hum
of
talk
and
the
smell
of
many
good
things
to
eat
two
chops
please
gerald
had
just
said
playing
with
a
plainly
shown
handful
of
money
so
as
to
leave
no
doubt
of
his
honourable
intentions
then
at
the
next
table
he
heard
the
words
ah
yes
curious
old
family
heirloom
the
ring
was
drawn
off
the
finger
of
that
and
ugli
murmuring
something
about
a
unique
curio
reached
his
impossible
hand
out
for
it
the
boy
was
watching
breathlessly
there
a
ring
right
enough
he
owned
and
then
the
ring
slipped
from
the
hand
of
ugli
and
skidded
along
the
floor
gerald
pounced
on
it
like
a
greyhound
on
a
hare
he
thrust
the
dull
circlet
on
his
finger
and
cried
out
aloud
in
that
crowded
place
i
wish
jimmy
and
i
were
inside
that
door
behind
the
statue
of
flora
it
was
the
only
safe
place
he
could
think
of
the
lights
and
sounds
and
scents
of
the
restaurant
died
away
as
a
dies
in
fire
a
in
water
i
do
know
and
gerald
never
knew
what
happened
in
that
restaurant
there
was
nothing
about
it
in
the
papers
though
gerald
looked
anxiously
for
extraordinary
disappearance
of
city
man
what
the
boy
did
or
thought
i
do
know
either
no
more
does
gerald
but
he
would
like
to
know
whereas
i
do
care
tuppence
the
world
went
on
all
right
anyhow
whatever
he
thought
or
did
the
lights
and
the
sounds
and
the
scents
of
pym
died
out
in
place
of
the
light
there
was
darkness
in
place
of
the
sounds
there
was
silence
and
in
place
of
the
scent
of
beef
pork
mutton
fish
veal
cabbage
onions
carrots
beer
and
tobacco
there
was
the
musty
damp
scent
of
a
place
underground
that
has
been
long
shut
up
illustration
he
cried
out
aloud
in
that
crowded
place
i
wish
jimmy
and
i
were
inside
that
door
behind
the
statue
of
flora
gerald
felt
sick
and
giddy
and
there
was
something
at
the
back
of
his
mind
that
he
knew
would
make
him
feel
sicker
and
giddier
as
soon
as
he
should
have
the
sense
to
remember
what
it
was
meantime
it
was
important
to
think
of
proper
words
to
soothe
the
city
man
that
had
once
been
jimmy
to
keep
him
quiet
till
time
like
a
spring
uncoiling
should
bring
the
reversal
of
the
spell
make
all
things
as
they
were
and
as
they
ought
to
be
but
he
fought
in
vain
for
words
there
were
none
nor
were
they
needed
for
through
the
deep
darkness
came
a
voice
and
it
was
not
the
voice
of
that
city
man
who
had
been
jimmy
but
the
voice
of
that
very
jimmy
who
was
gerald
little
brother
and
who
had
wished
that
unlucky
wish
for
riches
that
could
only
be
answered
by
changing
all
that
was
jimmy
young
and
poor
to
all
that
jimmy
rich
and
old
would
have
been
another
voice
said
jerry
jerry
are
you
awake
i
had
such
a
rum
dream
and
then
there
was
a
moment
when
nothing
was
said
or
done
gerald
felt
through
the
thick
darkness
and
the
thick
silence
and
the
thick
scent
of
old
earth
shut
up
and
he
got
hold
of
jimmy
hand
it
all
right
jimmy
old
chap
he
said
it
not
a
dream
now
that
beastly
ring
again
i
had
to
wish
us
here
to
get
you
back
at
all
out
of
your
dream
wish
us
where
jimmy
held
on
to
the
hand
in
a
way
that
in
the
daylight
of
life
he
would
have
been
the
first
to
call
babyish
inside
the
passage
behind
the
flora
statue
said
gerald
adding
it
all
right
really
oh
i
daresay
it
all
right
jimmy
answered
through
the
dark
with
an
irritation
not
strong
enough
to
make
him
loosen
his
hold
of
his
brother
hand
how
are
we
going
to
get
out
then
gerald
knew
what
it
was
that
was
waiting
to
make
him
feel
more
giddy
than
the
lightning
flight
from
cheapside
to
yalding
towers
had
been
able
to
make
him
but
he
said
stoutly
i
wish
us
out
of
course
though
all
the
time
he
knew
that
the
ring
would
not
undo
its
given
wishes
it
did
gerald
wished
he
handed
the
ring
carefully
to
jimmy
through
the
thick
darkness
and
jimmy
wished
and
there
they
still
were
in
that
black
passage
behind
flora
that
had
led
in
the
case
of
one
at
least
to
a
good
hotel
and
the
stone
door
was
shut
and
they
did
not
know
even
which
way
to
turn
to
it
if
i
only
had
some
matches
said
gerald
why
did
you
leave
me
in
the
dream
jimmy
almost
whimpered
it
was
light
there
and
i
was
just
going
to
have
salmon
and
cucumber
i
rejoined
gerald
in
gloom
was
just
going
to
have
steak
and
fried
potatoes
the
silence
and
the
darkness
and
the
earthy
scent
were
all
they
had
now
i
always
wondered
what
it
would
be
like
said
jimmy
in
low
even
tones
to
be
buried
alive
and
now
i
know
oh
his
voice
suddenly
rose
to
a
shriek
it
is
true
it
is
it
a
dream
that
what
it
is
there
was
a
pause
while
you
could
have
counted
ten
then
yes
said
gerald
bravely
through
the
scent
and
the
silence
and
the
darkness
it
just
a
dream
jimmy
old
chap
we
just
hold
on
and
call
out
now
and
then
just
for
the
lark
of
the
thing
but
it
really
only
a
dream
of
course
of
course
said
jimmy
in
the
silence
and
the
darkness
and
the
scent
of
old
earth
chapter
ix
there
is
a
curtain
thin
as
gossamer
clear
as
glass
strong
as
iron
that
hangs
for
ever
between
the
world
of
magic
and
the
world
that
seems
to
us
to
be
real
and
when
once
people
have
found
one
of
the
little
weak
spots
in
that
curtain
which
are
marked
by
magic
rings
and
amulets
and
the
like
almost
anything
may
happen
thus
it
is
not
surprising
that
mabel
and
kathleen
conscientiously
conducting
one
of
the
dullest
at
which
either
had
ever
assisted
should
suddenly
and
both
at
once
have
felt
a
strange
unreasonable
but
quite
irresistible
desire
to
return
instantly
to
the
temple
of
flora
even
at
the
cost
of
leaving
the
dolls
in
an
unwashed
state
and
only
half
the
raisins
eaten
they
went
as
one
has
to
go
when
the
magic
impulse
drives
one
against
their
better
judgment
against
their
wills
almost
and
the
nearer
they
came
to
the
temple
of
flora
in
the
golden
hush
of
the
afternoon
the
more
certain
each
was
that
they
could
not
possibly
have
done
otherwise
and
this
explains
exactly
how
it
was
that
when
gerald
and
jimmy
holding
hands
in
the
darkness
of
the
passage
uttered
their
first
concerted
yell
just
for
the
lark
of
the
thing
that
yell
was
instantly
answered
from
outside
a
crack
of
light
showed
in
that
part
of
the
passage
where
they
had
least
expected
the
door
to
be
the
stone
door
itself
swung
slowly
open
and
they
were
out
of
it
in
the
temple
of
flora
blinking
in
the
good
daylight
an
unresisting
prey
to
kathleen
embraces
and
the
questionings
of
mabel
and
you
left
that
loose
in
london
mabel
pointed
out
you
might
have
wished
it
to
be
with
you
too
it
all
right
where
it
is
said
gerald
i
could
think
of
everything
and
besides
no
thank
you
now
we
go
home
and
seal
up
the
ring
in
an
envelope
have
done
anything
with
the
ring
yet
said
kathleen
i
should
think
you
want
to
when
you
see
the
sort
of
things
it
does
with
you
said
gerald
it
would
do
things
like
that
if
was
wishing
with
it
kathleen
protested
look
here
said
mabel
let
just
put
it
back
in
the
and
have
done
with
it
i
ought
ever
to
have
taken
it
away
really
it
a
sort
of
stealing
it
quite
as
bad
really
as
eliza
borrowing
it
to
astonish
her
gentleman
friend
with
i
do
mind
putting
it
back
if
you
like
said
gerald
only
if
any
of
us
do
think
of
a
sensible
wish
you
let
us
have
it
out
again
of
course
of
course
of
course
mabel
agreed
so
they
trooped
up
to
the
castle
and
mabel
once
more
worked
the
spring
that
let
down
the
panelling
and
showed
the
jewels
and
the
ring
was
put
back
among
the
odd
dull
ornaments
that
mabel
had
once
said
were
magic
how
innocent
it
looks
said
gerald
you
would
think
there
was
any
magic
about
it
it
just
like
an
old
silly
ring
i
wonder
if
what
mabel
said
about
the
other
things
is
true
suppose
we
try
said
kathleen
think
magic
things
are
spiteful
they
just
enjoy
getting
you
into
tight
places
i
like
to
try
said
mabel
only
well
everything
been
rather
upsetting
and
i
forgotten
what
i
said
anything
was
so
had
the
others
perhaps
that
was
why
when
gerald
said
that
a
bronze
buckle
laid
on
the
foot
would
have
the
effect
of
boots
it
did
when
jimmy
a
little
of
the
city
man
he
had
been
clinging
to
him
still
said
that
the
steel
collar
would
ensure
your
always
having
money
in
your
pockets
his
own
remained
empty
and
when
mabel
and
kathleen
invented
qualities
of
the
most
delightful
nature
for
various
rings
and
chains
and
brooches
nothing
at
all
happened
it
only
the
ring
that
magic
said
mabel
at
last
and
i
say
she
added
in
quite
a
different
voice
what
suppose
even
the
ring
is
but
we
know
it
is
i
do
said
mabel
i
believe
it
not
at
all
i
believe
the
other
day
we
just
dreamed
all
these
things
it
the
day
i
made
up
that
nonsense
about
the
ring
no
it
is
said
gerald
you
were
in
your
then
what
said
mabel
opening
her
dark
eyes
very
wide
oh
do
be
silly
said
gerald
wearily
i
not
silly
said
mabel
and
i
think
it
time
you
went
i
sure
jimmy
wants
his
tea
of
course
i
do
said
jimmy
but
you
had
got
the
that
day
come
along
let
shut
up
the
shutters
and
leave
the
ring
in
its
long
home
what
ring
said
mabel
do
take
any
notice
of
her
said
gerald
she
only
trying
to
be
funny
no
i
not
said
mabel
but
i
inspired
like
a
python
or
a
sibylline
lady
what
ring
the
said
kathleen
the
invisibility
ring
do
you
see
said
mabel
her
eyes
wider
than
ever
the
what
you
it
is
that
how
it
came
to
make
us
invisible
i
just
said
it
oh
we
ca
leave
it
here
if
that
what
it
is
it
stealing
really
when
it
as
valuable
as
that
you
see
say
what
it
is
it
a
said
jimmy
we
had
that
before
and
you
had
your
silly
wish
said
mabel
more
and
more
excited
i
say
it
is
a
i
say
it
a
ring
that
makes
the
wearer
four
yards
high
she
had
caught
up
the
ring
as
she
spoke
and
even
as
she
spoke
the
ring
showed
high
above
the
children
heads
on
the
finger
of
an
impossible
mabel
who
was
indeed
twelve
feet
high
now
you
done
it
said
gerald
and
he
was
right
it
was
in
vain
that
mabel
asserted
that
the
ring
was
a
it
quite
clearly
was
it
was
what
she
had
said
it
was
and
you
ca
tell
at
all
how
long
the
effect
will
last
said
gerald
look
at
the
invisibleness
this
is
difficult
to
do
but
the
others
understood
him
it
may
last
for
days
said
kathleen
oh
mabel
it
silly
of
you
that
right
rub
it
in
said
mabel
bitterly
you
should
have
believed
me
when
i
said
it
was
what
i
said
it
was
then
i
should
have
had
to
show
you
and
i
should
be
this
silly
size
what
am
i
to
do
now
i
should
like
to
know
we
must
conceal
you
till
you
get
your
right
size
again
that
all
said
gerald
practically
yes
but
said
mabel
stamping
a
foot
inches
long
in
one
of
the
empty
rooms
you
would
be
afraid
of
course
not
said
mabel
oh
i
do
wish
we
just
put
the
ring
back
and
left
it
well
it
was
us
that
did
said
jimmy
with
more
truth
than
grammar
i
shall
put
it
back
now
said
mabel
tugging
at
it
i
would
if
i
were
you
said
gerald
thoughtfully
you
do
want
to
stay
that
length
do
you
and
unless
the
ring
on
your
finger
when
the
time
up
i
dare
say
it
would
act
the
exalted
mabel
sullenly
touched
the
spring
the
panels
slowly
slid
into
place
and
all
the
bright
jewels
were
hidden
once
more
the
room
was
merely
panelled
sunlit
and
unfurnished
now
said
mabel
where
am
i
to
hide
it
a
good
thing
auntie
gave
me
leave
to
stay
the
night
with
you
as
it
is
one
of
you
will
have
to
stay
the
night
with
me
i
not
going
to
be
left
alone
the
silly
height
i
am
height
was
the
right
word
mabel
had
said
four
yards
high
and
she
four
yards
high
but
she
was
hardly
any
thicker
than
when
her
height
was
four
feet
seven
and
the
effect
was
as
gerald
remarked
wonderfully
her
clothes
had
of
course
grown
with
her
and
she
looked
like
a
little
girl
reflected
in
one
of
those
long
bent
mirrors
at
rosherville
gardens
that
make
stout
people
look
so
happily
slender
and
slender
people
so
sadly
scraggy
she
sat
down
suddenly
on
the
floor
and
it
was
like
a
folding
itself
up
it
no
use
sitting
there
girl
said
gerald
illustration
she
sat
down
suddenly
on
the
floor
and
it
was
like
a
folding
itself
up
i
not
sitting
here
retorted
mabel
i
only
got
down
so
as
to
be
able
to
get
through
the
door
it
have
to
be
hands
and
knees
through
most
places
for
me
now
i
suppose
are
you
hungry
jimmy
asked
suddenly
i
do
know
said
mabel
desolately
it
it
such
a
long
way
off
well
i
scout
said
gerald
if
the
coast
clear
look
here
said
mabel
i
think
i
rather
be
out
of
doors
till
it
gets
dark
you
some
one
certain
to
see
you
not
if
i
go
through
the
said
mabel
there
a
with
a
passage
along
its
inside
like
the
in
luck
of
the
vails
in
luck
of
the
vails
it
a
ripping
book
it
was
that
book
first
set
me
on
to
hunt
for
hidden
doors
in
panels
and
things
if
i
crept
along
that
on
my
front
like
a
serpent
it
comes
out
amongst
the
rhododendrons
close
by
the
dinosaurus
we
could
camp
there
there
tea
said
gerald
who
had
had
no
dinner
that
just
what
there
is
said
jimmy
who
had
had
none
either
oh
you
desert
me
said
mabel
look
here
i
write
to
auntie
she
give
you
the
things
for
a
picnic
if
she
there
and
awake
if
she
is
one
of
the
maids
will
so
she
wrote
on
a
leaf
of
gerald
invaluable
dearest
auntie
please
may
we
have
some
things
for
a
picnic
gerald
will
bring
them
i
would
come
myself
but
i
am
a
little
tired
i
think
i
have
been
growing
rather
your
loving
niece
mabel
lots
please
because
some
of
us
are
very
hungry
it
was
found
difficult
but
possible
for
mabel
to
creep
along
the
tunnel
in
the
possible
but
slow
so
that
the
three
had
hardly
had
time
to
settle
themselves
among
the
rhododendrons
and
to
wonder
bitterly
what
on
earth
gerald
was
up
to
to
be
such
a
time
gone
when
he
returned
panting
under
the
weight
of
a
covered
basket
he
dumped
it
down
on
the
fine
grass
carpet
groaned
and
added
but
worth
it
where
our
mabel
the
long
pale
face
of
mabel
peered
out
from
rhododendron
leaves
very
near
the
ground
i
look
just
like
anybody
else
like
this
do
i
she
asked
anxiously
all
the
rest
of
me
miles
away
under
different
bushes
we
covered
up
the
bits
between
the
bushes
with
bracken
and
leaves
said
kathleen
avoiding
the
question
do
wriggle
mabel
or
waggle
them
off
jimmy
was
eagerly
unpacking
the
basket
it
was
a
generous
tea
a
long
loaf
butter
in
a
a
bottle
of
milk
a
bottle
of
water
cake
and
large
smooth
yellow
gooseberries
in
a
box
that
had
once
held
an
bottle
of
somebody
matchless
something
for
the
hair
and
moustache
mabel
cautiously
advanced
her
incredible
arms
from
the
rhododendron
and
leaned
on
one
of
her
spindly
elbows
gerald
cut
bread
and
butter
while
kathleen
obligingly
ran
round
at
mabel
request
to
see
that
the
green
coverings
had
not
dropped
from
any
of
the
remoter
parts
of
mabel
person
then
there
was
a
happy
hungry
silence
broken
only
by
those
brief
impassioned
suggestions
natural
to
such
an
occasion
more
cake
please
milk
ahoy
there
chuck
us
the
goosegogs
everyone
grew
calmer
more
contented
with
their
lot
a
pleasant
feeling
half
tiredness
and
half
restfulness
crept
to
the
extremities
of
the
party
even
the
unfortunate
mabel
was
conscious
of
it
in
her
remote
feet
that
lay
crossed
under
the
third
rhododendron
to
the
of
the
gerald
did
but
voice
the
feelings
of
the
others
when
he
said
not
without
regret
well
i
a
new
man
but
i
could
eat
so
much
as
another
goosegog
if
you
paid
me
could
said
mabel
yes
i
know
they
all
gone
and
i
had
my
share
but
i
it
me
being
so
long
i
suppose
a
delicious
peace
filled
the
summer
air
at
a
little
distance
the
grey
of
the
vast
stone
dinosaurus
showed
through
the
shrubs
he
too
seemed
peaceful
and
happy
gerald
caught
his
stone
eye
through
a
gap
in
the
foliage
his
glance
seemed
somehow
sympathetic
i
dare
say
he
liked
a
good
meal
in
his
day
said
gerald
stretching
luxuriously
who
did
the
dino
said
gerald
he
had
a
meal
said
kathleen
and
giggled
yes
did
he
said
mabel
giggling
also
you
must
laugh
lower
than
your
chest
said
kathleen
anxiously
or
your
green
stuff
will
joggle
off
what
do
you
mean
a
meal
jimmy
asked
suspiciously
what
are
you
sniggering
about
he
had
a
meal
things
to
put
in
his
inside
said
kathleen
still
giggling
oh
be
funny
if
you
want
to
said
jimmy
suddenly
cross
we
want
to
know
do
we
jerry
i
do
said
gerald
witheringly
i
to
know
wake
me
you
girls
when
you
finished
pretending
you
not
going
to
tell
he
tilted
his
hat
over
his
eyes
and
lay
back
in
the
attitude
of
slumber
oh
do
be
stupid
said
kathleen
hastily
it
only
that
we
fed
the
dinosaurus
through
the
hole
in
his
stomach
with
the
clothes
the
were
made
of
we
can
take
them
home
with
us
then
said
gerald
chewing
the
white
end
of
a
grass
stalk
so
that
all
right
look
here
said
kathleen
suddenly
i
got
an
idea
let
me
have
the
ring
a
bit
i
wo
say
what
the
idea
is
in
case
it
does
come
off
and
then
you
say
i
was
silly
i
give
it
back
before
we
go
oh
but
you
are
going
yet
said
mabel
pleading
she
pulled
off
the
ring
of
course
she
added
earnestly
i
only
too
glad
for
you
to
try
any
idea
however
silly
it
is
now
kathleen
idea
was
quite
simple
it
was
only
that
perhaps
the
ring
would
change
its
powers
if
some
one
else
renamed
it
some
one
who
was
not
under
the
power
of
its
enchantment
so
the
moment
it
had
passed
from
the
long
pale
hand
of
mabel
to
one
of
her
own
fat
warm
red
paws
she
jumped
up
crying
let
go
and
empty
the
dinosaurus
and
started
to
run
swiftly
towards
that
prehistoric
monster
she
had
a
good
start
she
wanted
to
say
aloud
yet
so
that
the
others
could
not
hear
her
this
is
a
it
gives
you
any
wish
you
choose
and
she
did
say
it
and
no
one
heard
her
except
the
birds
and
a
squirrel
or
two
and
perhaps
a
stone
faun
whose
pretty
face
seemed
to
turn
a
laughing
look
on
her
as
she
raced
past
its
pedestal
the
way
was
uphill
it
was
sunny
and
kathleen
had
run
her
hardest
though
her
brothers
caught
her
up
before
she
reached
the
great
black
shadow
of
the
dinosaurus
so
that
when
she
did
reach
that
shadow
she
was
very
hot
indeed
and
not
in
any
state
to
decide
calmly
on
the
best
wish
to
ask
for
i
get
up
and
move
the
things
down
because
i
know
exactly
where
i
put
them
she
said
gerald
made
a
back
jimmy
assisted
her
to
climb
up
and
she
disappeared
through
the
hole
into
the
dark
inside
of
the
monster
in
a
moment
a
shower
began
to
descend
from
the
opening
a
shower
of
empty
waistcoats
trousers
with
wildly
waving
legs
and
coats
with
sleeves
uncontrolled
heads
below
called
kathleen
and
down
came
and
and
and
rattling
and
chattering
to
each
other
as
they
came
come
on
said
jimmy
hold
on
a
bit
said
gerald
i
coming
up
he
caught
the
edge
of
the
hole
above
in
his
hands
and
jumped
just
as
he
got
his
shoulders
through
the
opening
and
his
knees
on
the
edge
he
heard
kathleen
boots
on
the
floor
of
the
dinosaurus
inside
and
kathleen
voice
saying
is
it
jolly
cool
in
here
i
suppose
statues
are
always
cool
i
do
wish
i
was
a
statue
oh
the
oh
was
a
cry
of
horror
and
anguish
and
it
seemed
to
be
cut
off
very
short
by
a
dreadful
stony
silence
what
up
gerald
asked
but
in
his
heart
he
knew
he
climbed
up
into
the
great
hollow
in
the
little
light
that
came
up
through
the
hole
he
could
see
something
white
against
the
grey
of
the
creature
sides
he
felt
in
his
pockets
still
kneeling
struck
a
match
and
when
the
blue
of
its
flame
changed
to
clear
yellow
he
looked
up
to
see
what
he
had
known
he
would
see
the
face
of
kathleen
white
stony
and
lifeless
her
hair
was
white
too
and
her
hands
clothes
shoes
everything
was
white
with
the
hard
cold
whiteness
of
marble
kathleen
had
her
wish
she
was
a
statue
there
was
a
long
moment
of
perfect
stillness
in
the
inside
of
the
dinosaurus
gerald
could
not
speak
it
was
too
sudden
too
terrible
it
was
worse
than
anything
that
had
happened
yet
then
he
turned
and
spoke
down
out
of
that
cold
stony
silence
to
jimmy
in
the
green
sunny
rustling
live
world
outside
jimmy
he
said
in
tones
perfectly
ordinary
and
matter
of
fact
kathleen
gone
and
said
that
ring
was
a
and
so
it
was
of
course
i
see
now
what
she
was
up
to
running
like
that
and
then
the
young
duffer
went
and
wished
she
was
a
statue
and
is
she
asked
jimmy
below
come
up
and
have
a
look
said
gerald
and
jimmy
came
partly
with
a
pull
from
gerald
and
partly
with
a
jump
of
his
own
she
a
statue
right
enough
he
said
in
awestruck
tones
is
it
awful
not
at
all
said
gerald
firmly
come
on
let
go
and
tell
mabel
to
mabel
therefore
who
had
discreetly
remained
with
her
long
length
screened
by
rhododendrons
the
two
boys
returned
and
broke
the
news
they
broke
it
as
one
breaks
a
bottle
with
a
illustration
kathleen
had
her
wish
she
was
a
statue
oh
my
goodness
said
mabel
and
writhed
through
her
long
length
so
that
the
leaves
and
fern
tumbled
off
in
little
showers
and
she
felt
the
sun
suddenly
hot
on
the
backs
of
her
legs
what
next
oh
my
goodness
she
come
all
right
said
gerald
with
outward
calm
yes
but
what
about
mabel
urged
i
have
got
the
ring
and
my
time
will
be
up
before
hers
is
could
you
get
it
back
ca
you
get
it
off
her
hand
i
put
it
back
on
her
hand
the
very
minute
i
was
my
right
size
again
faithfully
i
would
well
it
nothing
to
blub
about
said
jimmy
answering
the
sniffs
that
had
served
her
in
this
speech
for
commas
and
not
for
you
anyway
ah
you
do
know
said
mabel
you
do
know
what
it
is
to
be
as
long
as
i
am
do
do
try
and
get
the
ring
after
all
it
is
my
ring
more
than
any
of
the
rest
of
yours
anyhow
because
i
did
find
it
and
i
did
say
it
was
magic
the
sense
of
justice
always
present
in
the
breast
of
gerald
awoke
to
this
appeal
i
expect
the
ring
turned
to
stone
her
boots
have
and
all
her
clothes
but
i
go
and
see
only
if
i
ca
i
ca
and
it
no
use
your
making
a
silly
fuss
the
first
match
lighted
inside
the
dinosaurus
showed
the
ring
dark
on
the
white
hand
of
the
statuesque
kathleen
the
fingers
were
stretched
straight
out
gerald
took
hold
of
the
ring
and
to
his
surprise
it
slipped
easily
off
the
cold
smooth
marble
finger
i
say
cathy
old
girl
i
am
sorry
he
said
and
gave
the
marble
hand
a
squeeze
then
it
came
to
him
that
perhaps
she
could
hear
him
so
he
told
the
statue
exactly
what
he
and
the
others
meant
to
do
this
helped
to
clear
up
his
ideas
as
to
what
he
and
the
others
did
mean
to
do
so
that
when
after
thumping
the
statue
hearteningly
on
its
marble
back
he
returned
to
the
rhododendrons
he
was
able
to
give
his
orders
with
the
clear
precision
of
a
born
leader
as
he
later
said
and
since
the
others
had
neither
of
them
thought
of
any
plan
his
plan
was
accepted
as
the
plans
of
born
leaders
are
apt
to
be
here
your
precious
ring
he
said
to
mabel
now
you
not
frightened
of
anything
are
you
no
said
mabel
in
surprise
i
forgotten
that
look
here
i
stay
here
or
farther
up
in
the
wood
if
you
leave
me
all
the
coats
so
that
i
be
cold
in
the
night
then
i
shall
be
here
when
kathleen
comes
out
of
the
stone
again
yes
said
gerald
that
was
exactly
the
born
leader
idea
you
two
go
home
and
tell
mademoiselle
that
kathleen
staying
at
the
towers
she
is
yes
said
jimmy
she
certainly
is
the
magic
goes
in
lots
said
gerald
your
invisibility
was
hours
mine
fourteen
eliza
seven
when
it
was
a
it
began
with
seven
but
there
no
knowing
what
number
it
will
be
really
so
there
no
knowing
which
of
you
will
come
right
first
anyhow
we
sneak
out
by
the
cistern
window
and
come
down
the
trellis
after
we
said
to
mademoiselle
and
come
and
have
a
look
at
you
before
we
go
to
bed
i
think
you
better
come
close
up
to
the
dinosaurus
and
we
leaf
you
over
before
we
go
mabel
crawled
into
cover
of
the
taller
trees
and
there
stood
up
looking
as
slender
as
a
poplar
and
as
unreal
as
the
wrong
answer
to
a
sum
in
long
division
it
was
to
her
an
easy
matter
to
crouch
beneath
the
dinosaurus
to
put
her
head
up
through
the
opening
and
thus
to
behold
the
white
form
of
kathleen
it
all
right
dear
she
told
the
stone
image
i
shall
be
quite
close
to
you
you
call
me
as
soon
as
you
feel
you
coming
right
again
illustration
mabel
lay
down
was
covered
up
and
left
the
statue
remained
motionless
as
statues
usually
do
and
mabel
withdrew
her
head
lay
down
was
covered
up
and
left
the
boys
went
home
it
was
the
only
reasonable
thing
to
do
it
would
never
have
done
for
mademoiselle
to
become
anxious
and
set
the
police
on
their
track
every
one
felt
that
the
shock
of
discovering
the
missing
kathleen
not
only
in
a
dinosaurus
stomach
but
further
in
a
stone
statue
of
herself
might
well
have
unhinged
the
mind
of
any
constable
to
say
nothing
of
the
mind
of
mademoiselle
which
being
foreign
would
necessarily
be
a
mind
more
light
and
easy
to
upset
while
as
for
mabel
well
to
look
at
her
as
she
is
now
said
gerald
why
it
would
send
any
one
off
their
chump
except
us
we
different
said
jimmy
our
chumps
have
had
to
jolly
well
get
used
to
things
it
would
take
a
lot
to
upset
us
now
poor
old
cathy
all
the
same
said
gerald
yes
of
course
said
jimmy
the
sun
had
died
away
behind
the
black
trees
and
the
moon
was
rising
mabel
her
preposterous
length
covered
with
coats
waistcoats
and
trousers
laid
along
it
slept
peacefully
in
the
chill
of
the
evening
inside
the
dinosaurus
kathleen
alive
in
her
marble
slept
too
she
had
heard
gerald
words
had
seen
the
lighted
matches
she
was
kathleen
just
the
same
as
ever
only
she
was
kathleen
in
a
case
of
marble
that
would
not
let
her
move
it
would
not
have
let
her
cry
even
if
she
wanted
to
but
she
had
not
wanted
to
cry
inside
the
marble
was
not
cold
or
hard
it
seemed
somehow
to
be
softly
lined
with
warmth
and
pleasantness
and
safety
her
back
did
not
ache
with
stooping
her
limbs
were
not
stiff
with
the
hours
that
they
had
stayed
moveless
everything
was
well
better
than
well
one
had
only
to
wait
quietly
and
quite
comfortably
and
one
would
come
out
of
this
stone
case
and
once
more
be
the
kathleen
one
had
always
been
used
to
being
so
she
waited
happily
and
calmly
and
presently
waiting
changed
to
not
waiting
to
not
anything
and
close
held
in
the
soft
inwardness
of
the
marble
she
slept
as
peacefully
and
calmly
as
though
she
had
been
lying
in
her
own
bed
she
was
awakened
by
the
fact
that
she
was
not
lying
in
her
own
bed
was
not
indeed
lying
at
all
by
the
fact
that
she
was
standing
and
that
her
feet
had
pins
and
needles
in
them
her
arms
too
held
out
in
that
odd
way
were
stiff
and
tired
she
rubbed
her
eyes
yawned
and
remembered
she
had
been
a
statue
a
statue
inside
the
stone
dinosaurus
now
i
alive
again
was
her
instant
conclusion
and
i
get
out
of
it
she
sat
down
put
her
feet
through
the
hole
that
showed
faintly
grey
in
the
stone
beast
underside
and
as
she
did
so
a
long
slow
lurch
threw
her
sideways
on
the
stone
where
she
sat
dinosaurus
was
moving
said
kathleen
inside
it
how
dreadful
it
must
be
moonlight
and
it
come
alive
like
gerald
said
it
was
indeed
moving
she
could
see
through
the
hole
the
changing
surface
of
grass
and
bracken
and
moss
as
it
waddled
heavily
along
she
dared
not
drop
through
the
hole
while
it
moved
for
fear
it
should
crush
her
to
death
with
its
gigantic
feet
and
with
that
thought
came
another
where
was
mabel
somewhere
somewhere
suppose
one
of
the
great
feet
planted
itself
on
some
part
of
mabel
inconvenient
length
mabel
being
the
size
she
was
now
it
would
be
quite
difficult
not
to
step
on
some
part
or
other
of
her
if
she
should
happen
to
be
in
way
quite
difficult
however
much
one
tried
and
the
dinosaurus
would
not
try
why
should
it
kathleen
hung
in
an
agony
over
the
round
opening
the
huge
beast
swung
from
side
to
side
it
was
going
faster
it
was
no
good
she
dared
not
jump
out
anyhow
they
must
be
quite
away
from
mabel
by
now
faster
and
faster
went
the
dinosaurus
the
floor
of
its
stomach
sloped
they
were
going
downhill
twigs
cracked
and
broke
as
it
pushed
through
a
belt
of
evergreen
oaks
gravel
crunched
ground
beneath
its
stony
feet
then
stone
met
stone
there
was
a
pause
a
splash
they
were
close
to
water
the
lake
where
by
moonlight
hermes
fluttered
and
janus
and
the
dinosaurus
swam
together
kathleen
dropped
swiftly
through
the
hole
on
to
the
flat
marble
that
edged
the
basin
rushed
sideways
and
stood
panting
in
the
shadow
of
a
statue
pedestal
not
a
moment
too
soon
for
even
as
she
crouched
the
monster
lizard
slipped
heavily
into
the
water
drowning
a
thousand
smooth
shining
lily
pads
and
swam
away
towards
the
central
island
be
still
little
lady
i
leap
the
voice
came
from
the
pedestal
and
next
moment
phœbus
had
jumped
from
the
pedestal
in
his
little
temple
clearing
the
steps
and
landing
a
couple
of
yards
away
illustration
mabel
lay
down
was
covered
up
and
left
you
are
new
said
phœbus
over
his
graceful
shoulder
i
should
not
have
forgotten
you
if
once
i
had
seen
you
i
am
said
kathleen
quite
quite
new
and
i
did
know
you
could
talk
why
not
phœbus
laughed
you
can
talk
but
i
alive
am
not
i
he
asked
oh
yes
i
suppose
so
said
kathleen
distracted
but
not
afraid
only
i
thought
you
had
to
have
the
ring
on
before
one
could
even
see
you
move
phœbus
seemed
to
understand
her
which
was
rather
to
his
credit
for
she
had
certainly
not
expressed
herself
with
clearness
ah
that
for
mortals
he
said
can
hear
and
see
each
other
in
the
few
moments
when
life
is
ours
that
is
a
part
of
the
beautiful
enchantment
but
i
am
a
mortal
said
kathleen
you
are
as
modest
as
you
are
charming
said
phœbus
apollo
absently
the
white
water
calls
me
i
go
and
the
next
moment
rings
of
liquid
silver
spread
across
the
lake
widening
and
widening
from
the
spot
where
the
white
joined
hands
of
the
had
struck
the
water
as
he
dived
kathleen
turned
and
went
up
the
hill
towards
the
rhododendron
bushes
she
must
find
mabel
and
they
must
go
home
at
once
if
only
mabel
was
of
a
size
that
one
could
conveniently
take
home
with
one
most
likely
at
this
hour
of
enchantments
she
was
kathleen
heartened
by
the
thought
hurried
on
she
passed
through
the
rhododendron
bushes
remembered
the
pointed
painted
paper
face
that
had
looked
out
from
the
glossy
leaves
expected
to
be
frightened
and
was
she
found
mabel
easily
enough
and
much
more
easily
than
she
would
have
done
had
mabel
been
as
she
wished
to
find
her
for
quite
a
long
way
off
in
the
moonlight
she
could
see
that
long
and
form
extended
to
its
full
twelve
feet
and
covered
with
coats
and
trousers
and
waistcoats
mabel
looked
like
a
that
has
been
covered
in
sacks
in
frosty
weather
kathleen
touched
her
long
cheek
gently
and
she
woke
what
up
she
said
sleepily
it
only
me
kathleen
explained
how
cold
your
hands
are
said
mabel
wake
up
said
kathleen
and
let
talk
ca
we
go
home
now
i
awfully
tired
and
it
so
long
since
too
long
to
go
home
yet
said
kathleen
sadly
and
then
mabel
remembered
she
lay
with
closed
eyes
then
suddenly
she
stirred
and
cried
out
oh
cathy
i
feel
so
funny
like
one
of
those
horn
snakes
when
you
make
it
go
short
to
get
it
into
its
box
i
am
yes
i
know
i
am
she
was
and
kathleen
watching
her
agreed
that
it
was
exactly
like
the
shortening
of
a
horn
spiral
snake
between
the
closing
hands
of
a
child
mabel
distant
feet
drew
near
mabel
long
lean
arms
grew
shorter
mabel
face
was
no
longer
half
a
yard
long
you
coming
right
you
are
oh
i
am
so
glad
cried
kathleen
i
know
am
said
mabel
and
as
she
said
it
she
became
once
more
mabel
not
only
in
herself
which
of
course
she
had
been
all
the
time
but
in
her
outward
appearance
you
are
all
right
oh
hooray
hooray
i
so
glad
said
kathleen
kindly
and
now
we
go
home
at
once
dear
go
home
said
mabel
slowly
sitting
up
and
staring
at
kathleen
with
her
big
dark
eyes
go
home
like
that
like
what
kathleen
asked
impatiently
why
was
mabel
odd
reply
i
all
right
said
kathleen
come
on
do
you
mean
to
say
you
do
know
said
mabel
look
at
yourself
your
hands
your
dress
everything
kathleen
looked
at
her
hands
they
were
of
marble
whiteness
her
dress
too
her
shoes
her
stockings
even
the
ends
of
her
hair
she
was
white
as
snow
what
is
it
she
asked
beginning
to
tremble
what
am
i
all
this
horrid
colour
for
do
you
see
oh
cathy
do
you
see
you
come
right
you
a
statue
still
i
not
i
alive
i
talking
to
you
i
know
you
are
darling
said
mabel
soothing
her
as
one
soothes
a
fractious
child
that
because
it
moonlight
but
you
can
see
i
alive
of
course
i
can
i
got
the
ring
but
i
all
right
i
i
am
illustration
what
is
it
she
asked
beginning
to
tremble
what
am
i
all
this
horrid
colour
for
do
you
see
said
mabel
gently
taking
her
white
marble
hand
you
not
all
right
it
moonlight
and
you
a
statue
and
just
come
alive
with
all
the
other
statues
and
when
the
moon
goes
down
you
just
be
a
statue
again
the
difficulty
dear
about
our
going
home
again
you
just
a
statue
still
only
you
come
alive
with
the
other
marble
things
where
the
dinosaurus
in
his
bath
said
kathleen
and
so
are
all
the
other
stone
beasts
well
said
mabel
trying
to
look
on
the
bright
side
of
things
then
we
got
one
thing
at
any
rate
to
be
thankful
for
chapter
x
if
said
kathleen
sitting
disconsolate
in
her
marble
if
i
am
really
a
statue
come
alive
i
wonder
you
not
afraid
of
me
i
got
the
ring
said
mabel
with
decision
cheer
up
dear
you
will
soon
be
better
try
not
to
think
about
it
she
spoke
as
you
speak
to
a
child
that
has
cut
its
finger
or
fallen
down
on
the
garden
path
and
rises
up
with
grazed
knees
to
which
gravel
sticks
intimately
i
know
kathleen
absently
answered
and
i
been
thinking
said
mabel
brightly
we
might
find
out
a
lot
about
this
magic
place
if
the
other
statues
are
too
proud
to
talk
to
us
they
are
kathleen
assured
her
at
least
phœbus
was
he
was
most
awfully
polite
and
nice
where
is
he
mabel
asked
in
the
lake
he
was
said
kathleen
then
let
go
down
there
said
mabel
oh
cathy
it
is
jolly
being
your
own
proper
thickness
again
she
jumped
up
and
the
withered
ferns
and
branches
that
had
covered
her
long
length
and
had
been
gathered
closely
upon
her
as
she
shrank
to
her
proper
size
fell
as
forest
leaves
do
when
sudden
storms
tear
them
but
the
white
kathleen
did
not
move
the
two
sat
on
the
grey
moonlit
grass
with
the
quiet
of
the
night
all
about
them
the
great
park
was
still
as
a
painted
picture
only
the
splash
of
the
fountains
and
the
whistle
of
the
western
express
broke
the
silence
which
at
the
same
time
they
deepened
what
cheer
little
sister
said
a
voice
behind
them
a
golden
voice
they
turned
quick
startled
heads
as
birds
surprised
might
turn
there
in
the
moonlight
stood
phœbus
dripping
still
from
the
lake
and
smiling
at
them
very
gentle
very
friendly
oh
it
you
said
kathleen
none
other
said
phœbus
cheerfully
who
is
your
friend
the
this
is
mabel
said
kathleen
mabel
got
up
and
bowed
hesitated
and
held
out
a
hand
i
am
your
slave
little
lady
said
phœbus
enclosing
it
in
marble
fingers
but
i
fail
to
understand
how
you
can
see
us
and
why
you
do
not
fear
mabel
held
up
the
hand
that
wore
the
ring
quite
sufficient
explanation
said
phœbus
but
since
you
have
that
why
retain
your
mottled
earthy
appearance
become
a
statue
and
swim
with
us
in
the
lake
i
ca
swim
said
mabel
evasively
nor
yet
me
said
kathleen
can
said
phœbus
all
statues
that
come
to
life
are
proficient
in
all
athletic
exercises
and
you
child
of
the
dark
eyes
and
hair
like
night
wish
yourself
a
statue
and
join
our
revels
i
rather
not
if
you
will
excuse
me
said
mabel
cautiously
you
see
this
ring
you
wish
for
things
and
you
never
know
how
long
they
going
to
last
it
would
be
jolly
and
all
that
to
be
a
statue
but
in
the
morning
i
should
wish
i
had
often
do
they
say
mused
phœbus
but
child
you
seem
ignorant
of
the
powers
of
your
ring
wish
exactly
and
the
ring
will
exactly
perform
if
you
give
no
limit
of
time
strange
enchantments
woven
by
arithmos
the
outcast
god
of
numbers
will
creep
in
and
spoil
the
spell
say
thus
wish
that
till
the
dawn
i
may
be
a
statue
of
living
marble
even
as
my
child
friend
and
that
after
that
time
i
may
be
as
before
mabel
of
the
dark
eyes
and
hair
oh
yes
do
it
would
be
so
jolly
cried
kathleen
do
mabel
and
if
we
both
statues
shall
we
be
afraid
of
the
dinosaurus
in
the
world
of
living
marble
fear
is
not
said
phœbus
are
we
not
brothers
we
and
the
dinosaurus
brethren
alike
wrought
of
stone
and
life
and
could
i
swim
if
i
did
swim
and
float
and
dive
and
with
the
ladies
of
olympus
spread
the
nightly
feast
eat
of
the
food
of
the
gods
drink
their
cup
listen
to
the
song
that
is
undying
and
catch
the
laughter
of
immortal
lips
a
feast
said
kathleen
oh
mabel
do
you
would
if
you
were
as
hungry
as
i
am
but
it
wo
be
real
food
urged
mabel
it
will
be
real
to
you
as
to
us
said
phœbus
there
is
no
other
realness
even
in
your
world
still
mabel
hesitated
then
she
looked
at
kathleen
legs
and
suddenly
said
very
well
i
will
but
first
i
take
off
my
shoes
and
stockings
marble
boots
look
simply
awful
especially
the
laces
and
a
marble
stocking
that
coming
down
and
mine
she
had
pulled
off
shoes
and
stockings
and
pinafore
mabel
has
the
sense
of
beauty
said
phœbus
approvingly
speak
the
spell
child
and
i
will
lead
you
to
the
ladies
of
olympus
mabel
trembling
a
little
spoke
it
and
there
were
two
little
live
statues
in
the
moonlit
glade
tall
phœbus
took
a
hand
of
each
come
run
he
cried
and
they
ran
oh
it
is
jolly
mabel
panted
look
at
my
white
feet
in
the
grass
i
thought
it
would
feel
stiff
to
be
a
statue
but
it
does
there
is
no
stiffness
about
the
immortals
laughed
the
for
you
are
one
of
us
and
with
that
they
ran
down
the
slope
to
the
lake
jump
he
cried
and
they
jumped
and
the
water
splashed
up
round
three
white
gleaming
shapes
oh
i
swim
breathed
kathleen
so
can
i
said
mabel
of
course
you
can
said
phœbus
now
three
times
round
the
lake
and
then
make
for
the
island
side
by
side
the
three
swam
phœbus
swimming
gently
to
keep
pace
with
the
children
their
marble
clothes
did
not
seem
to
interfere
at
all
with
their
swimming
as
your
clothes
would
if
you
suddenly
jumped
into
the
basin
of
the
trafalgar
square
fountains
and
tried
to
swim
there
and
they
swam
most
beautifully
with
that
perfect
ease
and
absence
of
effort
or
tiredness
which
you
must
have
noticed
about
your
own
swimming
in
dreams
and
it
was
the
most
lovely
place
to
swim
in
the
whose
long
snaky
stalks
are
so
inconvenient
to
ordinary
swimmers
did
not
in
the
least
interfere
with
the
movements
of
marble
arms
and
legs
the
moon
was
high
in
the
clear
the
weeping
willows
cypresses
temples
terraces
banks
of
trees
and
shrubs
and
the
wonderful
old
house
all
added
to
the
romantic
charm
of
the
scene
this
is
the
nicest
thing
the
ring
has
brought
us
yet
said
mabel
through
a
languid
but
perfect
i
thought
you
enjoy
it
said
phœbus
kindly
now
once
more
round
and
then
the
island
illustration
side
by
side
the
three
swam
they
landed
on
the
island
amid
a
fringe
of
rushes
yarrow
and
a
few
late
scented
powdery
creamy
heads
of
the
island
was
bigger
than
it
looked
from
the
bank
and
it
seemed
covered
with
trees
and
shrubs
but
when
phœbus
leading
the
way
they
went
into
the
shadow
of
these
they
perceived
that
beyond
the
trees
lay
a
light
much
nearer
to
them
than
the
other
side
of
the
island
could
possibly
be
and
almost
at
once
they
were
through
the
belt
of
trees
and
could
see
where
the
light
came
from
the
trees
they
had
just
passed
among
made
a
dark
circle
round
a
big
cleared
space
standing
up
thick
and
dark
like
a
crowd
round
a
football
field
as
kathleen
remarked
first
came
a
wide
smooth
ring
of
lawn
then
marble
steps
going
down
to
a
round
pool
where
there
were
no
only
gold
and
silver
fish
that
darted
here
and
there
like
flashes
of
quicksilver
and
dark
flames
and
the
enclosed
space
of
water
and
marble
and
grass
was
lighted
with
a
clear
white
radiant
light
seven
times
stronger
than
the
whitest
moonlight
and
in
the
still
waters
of
the
pool
seven
moons
lay
reflected
one
could
see
that
they
were
only
reflections
by
the
way
their
shape
broke
and
changed
as
the
gold
and
silver
fish
rippled
the
water
with
moving
fin
and
tail
that
steered
the
girls
looked
up
at
the
sky
almost
expecting
to
see
seven
moons
there
but
no
the
old
moon
shone
alone
as
she
had
always
shone
on
them
there
are
seven
moons
said
mabel
blankly
and
pointed
which
is
not
manners
of
course
said
phœbus
kindly
everything
in
our
world
is
seven
times
as
much
so
as
in
yours
but
there
are
seven
of
you
said
mabel
no
but
i
am
seven
times
as
much
said
the
sun
god
you
see
numbers
and
there
quantity
to
say
nothing
of
quality
you
see
that
i
sure
not
quite
said
kathleen
explanations
always
weary
me
phœbus
interrupted
shall
we
join
the
ladies
on
the
further
side
of
the
pool
was
a
large
group
so
white
that
it
seemed
to
make
a
great
white
hole
in
the
trees
some
twenty
or
thirty
figures
there
were
in
the
group
all
statues
and
all
alive
some
were
dipping
their
white
feet
among
the
gold
and
silver
fish
and
sending
ripples
across
the
faces
of
the
seven
moons
some
were
pelting
each
other
with
roses
roses
so
sweet
that
the
girls
could
smell
them
even
across
the
pool
others
were
holding
hands
and
dancing
in
a
ring
and
two
were
sitting
on
the
steps
playing
which
is
a
very
ancient
game
indeed
with
a
thread
of
white
marble
as
the
advanced
a
shout
of
greeting
and
gay
laughter
went
up
late
again
phœbus
some
one
called
out
and
another
did
one
of
your
horses
cast
a
shoe
and
yet
another
called
out
something
about
laurels
i
bring
two
guests
said
phœbus
and
instantly
the
statues
crowded
round
stroking
the
girls
hair
patting
their
cheeks
and
calling
them
the
prettiest
are
the
wreaths
ready
hebe
the
tallest
and
most
splendid
of
the
ladies
called
out
make
two
more
and
almost
directly
hebe
came
down
the
steps
her
round
arms
hung
thick
with
there
was
one
for
each
marble
head
every
one
now
looked
seven
times
more
beautiful
than
before
which
in
the
case
of
the
gods
and
goddesses
is
saying
a
good
deal
the
children
remembered
how
at
the
raspberry
vinegar
feast
mademoiselle
had
said
that
gods
and
goddesses
always
wore
wreaths
for
meals
hebe
herself
arranged
the
roses
on
the
girls
heads
and
aphrodite
urania
the
dearest
lady
in
the
world
with
a
voice
like
mother
at
those
moments
when
you
love
her
most
took
them
by
the
hands
and
said
come
we
must
get
the
feast
ready
eros
psyche
hebe
ganymede
all
you
young
people
can
arrange
the
fruit
i
do
see
any
fruit
said
kathleen
as
four
slender
forms
disengaged
themselves
from
the
white
crowd
and
came
toward
them
you
will
though
said
eros
a
really
nice
boy
as
the
girls
instantly
agreed
you
only
got
to
pick
it
like
this
said
psyche
lifting
her
marble
arms
to
a
willow
branch
she
reached
out
her
hand
to
the
children
it
held
a
ripe
pomegranate
i
see
said
mabel
you
just
she
laid
her
fingers
to
the
willow
branch
and
the
firm
softness
of
a
big
peach
was
within
them
yes
just
that
laughed
psyche
who
was
a
darling
as
any
one
could
see
after
this
hebe
gathered
a
few
silver
baskets
from
a
convenient
alder
and
the
four
picked
fruit
industriously
meanwhile
the
elder
statues
were
busy
plucking
golden
goblets
and
jugs
and
dishes
from
the
branches
of
and
young
oaks
and
filling
them
with
everything
nice
to
eat
and
drink
that
any
one
could
possibly
want
and
these
were
spread
on
the
steps
it
was
a
celestial
picnic
then
everyone
sat
or
lay
down
and
the
feast
began
and
oh
the
taste
of
the
food
served
on
those
dishes
the
sweet
wonder
of
the
drink
that
melted
from
those
gold
cups
on
the
white
lips
of
the
company
and
the
fruit
there
is
no
fruit
like
it
grown
on
earth
just
as
there
is
no
laughter
like
the
laughter
of
those
lips
no
songs
like
the
songs
that
stirred
the
silence
of
that
night
of
wonder
oh
cried
kathleen
and
through
her
fingers
the
juice
of
her
third
peach
fell
like
tears
on
the
marble
steps
i
do
wish
the
boys
were
here
i
do
wonder
what
they
doing
said
mabel
illustration
it
was
a
celestial
picnic
at
this
moment
said
hermes
who
had
just
made
a
wide
ring
of
flight
as
a
pigeon
does
and
come
back
into
the
circle
at
this
moment
they
are
wandering
desolately
near
the
home
of
the
dinosaurus
having
escaped
from
their
home
by
a
window
in
search
of
you
they
fear
that
you
have
perished
and
they
would
weep
if
they
did
not
know
that
tears
do
not
become
a
man
however
youthful
kathleen
stood
up
and
brushed
the
crumbs
of
ambrosia
from
her
marble
lap
thank
you
all
very
much
she
said
it
was
very
kind
of
you
to
have
us
and
we
enjoyed
ourselves
very
much
but
i
think
we
ought
to
go
now
please
if
it
is
anxiety
about
your
brothers
said
phœbus
obligingly
it
is
the
easiest
thing
in
the
world
for
them
to
join
you
lend
me
your
ring
a
moment
he
took
it
from
kathleen
hand
dipped
it
in
the
reflection
of
one
of
the
seven
moons
and
gave
it
back
she
clutched
it
now
said
the
wish
for
them
that
which
mabel
wished
for
herself
say
i
know
kathleen
interrupted
i
wish
that
the
boys
may
be
statues
of
living
marble
like
mabel
and
me
till
dawn
and
afterwards
be
like
they
are
now
if
you
had
interrupted
said
phœbus
but
there
we
ca
expect
old
heads
on
shoulders
of
young
marble
you
should
have
wished
them
and
but
no
matter
hermes
old
chap
cut
across
and
fetch
them
and
explain
things
as
you
come
he
dipped
the
ring
again
in
one
of
the
reflected
moons
before
he
gave
it
back
to
kathleen
there
he
said
now
it
washed
clean
ready
for
the
next
magic
it
is
not
our
custom
to
question
guests
said
hera
the
queen
turning
her
great
eyes
on
the
children
but
that
ring
excites
i
am
sure
the
interest
of
us
all
it
is
ring
said
phœbus
that
of
course
said
hera
but
if
it
were
not
inhospitable
to
ask
questions
i
should
ask
how
came
it
into
the
hands
of
these
that
said
phœbus
is
a
long
tale
after
the
feast
the
story
and
after
the
story
the
song
hermes
seemed
to
have
explained
everything
quite
fully
for
when
gerald
and
jimmy
in
marble
whiteness
arrived
each
clinging
to
one
of
the
god
winged
feet
and
so
borne
through
the
air
they
were
certainly
quite
at
ease
they
made
their
best
bows
to
the
goddesses
and
took
their
places
as
unembarrassed
as
though
they
had
had
olympian
suppers
every
night
of
their
lives
hebe
had
woven
wreaths
of
roses
ready
for
them
and
as
kathleen
watched
them
eating
and
drinking
perfectly
at
home
in
their
marble
she
was
very
glad
that
amid
the
welling
springs
of
immortal
she
had
not
forgotten
her
brothers
and
now
said
hera
when
the
boys
had
been
supplied
with
everything
they
could
possibly
desire
and
more
than
they
could
eat
now
for
the
story
yes
said
mabel
intensely
and
kathleen
said
oh
now
for
the
story
how
splendid
the
story
said
phœbus
unexpectedly
will
be
told
by
our
guests
oh
said
kathleen
shrinking
the
lads
maybe
are
bolder
said
zeus
the
king
taking
off
his
which
was
a
little
tight
and
rubbing
his
compressed
ears
i
really
ca
said
gerald
besides
i
do
know
any
stories
nor
yet
me
said
jimmy
it
the
story
of
how
we
got
the
ring
that
they
want
said
mabel
in
a
hurry
i
tell
it
if
you
like
once
upon
a
time
there
was
a
little
girl
called
mabel
she
added
yet
more
hastily
and
went
on
with
the
tale
all
the
tale
of
the
enchanted
castle
or
almost
all
that
you
have
read
in
these
pages
the
marble
olympians
listened
enchanted
almost
as
enchanted
as
the
castle
itself
and
the
soft
moonlit
moments
fell
past
like
pearls
dropping
into
a
deep
pool
and
so
mabel
ended
abruptly
kathleen
wished
for
the
boys
and
the
lord
hermes
fetched
them
and
here
we
all
are
a
burst
of
interested
comment
and
question
blossomed
out
round
the
end
of
the
story
suddenly
broken
off
short
by
mabel
but
said
she
brushing
it
aside
as
it
grew
thinner
now
we
want
to
tell
to
tell
you
how
you
come
to
be
alive
and
how
you
know
about
the
ring
and
everything
you
know
everything
i
know
phœbus
laughed
it
was
to
him
that
she
had
spoken
and
not
his
lips
only
but
all
the
white
lips
curled
in
laughter
the
span
of
your
life
my
would
not
contain
the
words
i
should
speak
to
tell
you
all
i
know
well
about
the
ring
anyhow
and
how
you
come
alive
said
gerald
you
see
it
very
puzzling
to
us
tell
them
phœbus
said
the
dearest
lady
in
the
world
do
tease
the
children
so
phœbus
leaning
back
against
a
heap
of
that
dionysus
had
lavishly
plucked
from
a
spruce
fir
told
all
statues
he
said
can
come
alive
when
the
moon
shines
if
they
so
choose
but
statues
that
are
placed
in
ugly
cities
do
not
choose
why
should
they
weary
themselves
with
the
contemplation
of
the
hideous
quite
so
said
gerald
politely
to
fill
the
pause
in
your
beautiful
temples
the
went
on
the
images
of
your
priests
and
of
your
warriors
who
lie
on
their
tombs
come
alive
and
walk
in
their
marble
about
their
temples
and
through
the
woods
and
fields
but
only
on
one
night
in
all
the
year
can
any
see
them
you
have
beheld
us
because
you
held
the
ring
and
are
of
one
brotherhood
with
us
in
your
marble
but
on
that
one
night
all
may
behold
us
and
when
is
that
gerald
asked
again
polite
in
a
pause
at
the
festival
of
the
harvest
said
phœbus
on
that
night
as
the
moon
rises
it
strikes
one
beam
of
perfect
light
on
to
the
altar
in
certain
temples
one
of
these
temples
is
in
hellas
buried
under
the
fall
of
a
mountain
which
zeus
being
angry
hurled
down
upon
it
one
is
in
this
land
it
is
in
this
great
garden
then
said
gerald
much
interested
if
we
were
to
come
up
to
that
temple
on
that
night
we
could
see
you
even
without
being
statues
or
having
the
ring
even
so
said
phœbus
more
any
question
asked
by
a
mortal
we
are
on
that
night
bound
to
answer
and
the
night
is
when
ah
said
phœbus
and
laughed
would
you
like
to
know
then
the
great
marble
king
of
the
gods
yawned
stroked
his
long
beard
and
said
enough
of
stories
phœbus
tune
your
lyre
but
the
ring
said
mabel
in
a
whisper
as
the
tuned
the
white
strings
of
a
sort
of
marble
harp
that
lay
at
his
feet
about
how
you
know
all
about
the
ring
presently
the
whispered
back
zeus
must
be
obeyed
but
ask
me
again
before
dawn
and
i
will
tell
you
all
i
know
of
it
mabel
drew
back
and
leaned
against
the
comfortable
knees
of
one
demeter
kathleen
and
psyche
sat
holding
hands
gerald
and
jimmy
lay
at
full
length
chins
on
elbows
gazing
at
the
and
even
as
he
held
the
lyre
before
ever
his
fingers
began
to
sweep
the
strings
the
spirit
of
music
hung
in
the
air
enchanting
enslaving
silencing
all
thought
but
the
thought
of
itself
all
desire
but
the
desire
to
listen
to
it
then
phœbus
struck
the
strings
and
softly
plucked
melody
from
them
and
all
the
beautiful
dreams
of
all
the
world
came
fluttering
close
with
wings
like
doves
wings
and
all
the
lovely
thoughts
that
sometimes
hover
near
but
not
so
near
that
you
can
catch
them
now
came
home
as
to
their
nests
in
the
hearts
of
those
who
listened
and
those
who
listened
forgot
time
and
space
and
how
to
be
sad
and
how
to
be
naughty
and
it
seemed
that
the
whole
world
lay
like
a
magic
apple
in
the
hand
of
each
listener
and
that
the
whole
world
was
good
and
beautiful
and
then
suddenly
the
spell
was
shattered
phœbus
struck
a
broken
chord
followed
by
an
instant
of
silence
then
he
sprang
up
crying
the
dawn
the
dawn
to
your
pedestals
o
gods
in
an
instant
the
whole
crowd
of
beautiful
marble
people
had
leaped
to
its
feet
had
rushed
through
the
belt
of
wood
that
cracked
and
rustled
as
they
went
and
the
children
heard
them
splash
in
the
water
beyond
they
heard
too
the
gurgling
breathing
of
a
great
beast
and
knew
that
the
dinosaurus
too
was
returning
to
his
own
place
only
hermes
had
time
since
one
flies
more
swiftly
than
one
swims
to
hover
above
them
for
one
moment
and
to
whisper
with
a
mischievous
laugh
in
fourteen
days
from
now
at
the
temple
of
strange
stones
what
the
secret
of
the
ring
gasped
mabel
the
ring
is
the
heart
of
the
magic
said
hermes
ask
at
the
moonrise
on
the
fourteenth
day
and
you
shall
know
all
with
that
he
waved
the
snowy
caduceus
and
rose
in
the
air
supported
by
his
winged
feet
and
as
he
went
the
seven
reflected
moons
died
out
and
a
chill
wind
began
to
blow
a
grey
light
grew
and
grew
the
birds
stirred
and
twittered
and
the
marble
slipped
away
from
the
children
like
a
skin
that
shrivels
in
fire
and
they
were
statues
no
more
but
flesh
and
blood
children
as
they
used
to
be
standing
in
brambles
and
long
coarse
grass
there
was
no
smooth
lawn
no
marble
steps
no
the
dew
lay
thick
on
the
grass
and
the
brambles
and
it
was
very
cold
we
ought
to
have
gone
with
them
said
mabel
with
chattering
teeth
we
ca
swim
now
we
not
marble
and
i
suppose
this
the
island
it
was
and
they
could
swim
they
knew
it
one
always
knows
those
sort
of
things
somehow
without
trying
for
instance
you
know
perfectly
that
you
ca
fly
there
are
some
things
that
there
is
no
mistake
about
the
dawn
grew
brighter
and
the
outlook
more
black
every
moment
there
is
a
boat
i
suppose
jimmy
asked
no
said
mabel
not
on
this
side
of
the
lake
there
one
in
the
of
course
if
you
could
swim
there
you
know
i
ca
said
jimmy
ca
any
one
think
of
anything
gerald
asked
shivering
when
they
find
we
disappeared
they
drag
all
the
water
for
miles
round
said
jimmy
hopefully
in
case
we
fallen
in
and
sunk
to
the
bottom
when
they
come
to
drag
this
we
can
yell
and
be
rescued
yes
dear
that
be
nice
was
gerald
bitter
comment
do
be
so
disagreeable
said
mabel
with
a
tone
so
strangely
cheerful
that
the
rest
stared
at
her
in
amazement
the
ring
she
said
of
course
we
only
got
to
wish
ourselves
home
with
it
phœbus
washed
it
in
the
moon
ready
for
the
next
wish
you
did
tell
us
about
that
said
gerald
in
accents
of
perfect
good
temper
never
mind
where
the
ring
had
it
mabel
reminded
kathleen
i
know
i
had
said
that
child
in
stricken
tones
but
i
gave
it
to
psyche
to
look
at
and
and
she
got
it
on
her
finger
every
one
tried
not
to
be
angry
with
kathleen
all
partly
succeeded
if
we
ever
get
off
this
beastly
island
said
gerald
i
suppose
you
can
find
psyche
statue
and
get
it
off
again
no
i
ca
mabel
moaned
i
do
know
where
the
statue
is
never
seen
it
it
may
be
in
hellas
wherever
that
is
or
anywhere
for
anything
know
no
one
had
anything
kind
to
say
and
it
is
pleasant
to
record
that
nobody
said
anything
and
now
it
was
grey
daylight
and
the
sky
to
the
north
was
flushing
in
pale
pink
and
lavender
the
boys
stood
moodily
hands
in
pockets
mabel
and
kathleen
seemed
to
find
it
impossible
not
to
cling
together
and
all
about
their
legs
the
long
grass
was
icy
with
dew
a
faint
sniff
and
a
caught
breath
broke
the
silence
now
look
here
said
gerald
briskly
i
wo
have
it
do
you
hear
snivelling
no
good
at
all
no
i
not
a
pig
it
for
your
own
good
lets
make
a
tour
of
the
island
perhaps
there
a
boat
hidden
somewhere
among
the
overhanging
boughs
how
could
there
be
mabel
asked
some
one
might
have
left
it
there
i
suppose
said
gerald
but
how
would
they
have
got
off
the
island
in
another
boat
of
course
said
gerald
come
on
downheartedly
and
quite
sure
that
there
was
and
could
be
any
boat
the
four
children
started
to
explore
the
island
how
often
each
one
of
them
had
dreamed
of
islands
how
often
wished
to
be
stranded
on
one
well
now
they
were
reality
is
sometimes
quite
different
from
dreams
and
not
half
so
nice
it
was
worst
of
all
for
mabel
whose
shoes
and
stockings
were
far
away
on
the
mainland
the
coarse
grass
and
brambles
were
very
cruel
to
bare
legs
and
feet
they
stumbled
through
the
wood
to
the
edge
of
the
water
but
it
was
impossible
to
keep
close
to
the
edge
of
the
island
the
branches
grew
too
thickly
there
was
a
narrow
grassy
path
that
wound
in
and
out
among
the
trees
and
this
they
followed
dejected
and
mournful
every
moment
made
it
less
possible
for
them
to
hope
to
get
back
to
the
unnoticed
and
if
they
were
missed
and
beds
found
in
their
present
state
well
there
would
be
a
row
of
some
sort
and
as
gerald
said
farewell
to
liberty
of
course
we
can
get
off
all
right
said
gerald
just
all
shout
when
we
see
a
gardener
or
a
keeper
on
the
mainland
but
if
we
do
concealment
is
at
an
end
and
all
is
absolutely
up
yes
said
everyone
gloomily
come
buck
up
said
gerald
the
spirit
of
the
born
general
beginning
to
reawaken
in
him
we
shall
get
out
of
this
scrape
all
right
as
got
out
of
others
you
know
we
shall
see
the
sun
coming
out
you
feel
all
right
and
jolly
now
do
you
yes
oh
yes
said
everyone
in
tones
of
unmixed
misery
the
sun
was
now
risen
and
through
a
deep
cleft
in
the
hills
it
sent
a
strong
shaft
of
light
straight
at
the
island
the
yellow
light
almost
level
struck
through
the
stems
of
the
trees
and
dazzled
the
eyes
this
with
the
fact
that
he
was
not
looking
where
he
was
going
as
jimmy
did
not
fail
to
point
out
later
was
enough
to
account
for
what
now
happened
to
gerald
who
was
leading
the
melancholy
little
procession
he
stumbled
clutched
at
a
missed
his
clutch
and
disappeared
with
a
yell
and
a
clatter
and
mabel
who
came
next
only
pulled
herself
up
just
in
time
not
to
fall
down
a
steep
flight
of
steps
that
seemed
to
open
suddenly
in
the
ground
at
her
feet
oh
gerald
she
called
down
the
steps
are
you
hurt
no
said
gerald
out
of
sight
and
crossly
for
he
hurt
rather
severely
it
steps
and
there
a
passage
there
always
is
said
jimmy
i
knew
there
was
a
passage
said
mabel
it
goes
under
the
water
and
comes
out
at
the
temple
of
flora
even
the
gardeners
know
that
but
they
wo
go
down
for
fear
of
snakes
then
we
can
get
out
that
way
i
do
think
you
might
have
said
so
gerald
voice
came
up
to
say
i
did
think
of
it
said
mabel
at
least
and
i
suppose
it
goes
past
the
place
where
the
found
its
good
hotel
i
not
going
said
kathleen
positively
not
in
the
dark
i
not
so
i
tell
you
very
well
baby
said
gerald
sternly
and
his
head
appeared
from
below
very
suddenly
through
interlacing
brambles
no
one
asked
you
to
go
in
the
dark
we
leave
you
here
if
you
like
and
return
and
rescue
you
with
a
boat
jimmy
the
bicycle
lamp
he
reached
up
a
hand
for
it
jimmy
produced
from
his
bosom
the
place
where
lamps
are
always
kept
in
fairy
stories
see
aladdin
and
others
a
bicycle
lamp
we
brought
it
he
explained
so
as
not
to
break
our
shins
over
bits
of
long
mabel
among
the
rhododendrons
now
said
gerald
very
firmly
striking
a
match
and
opening
the
thick
rounded
glass
front
of
the
bicycle
lamp
i
do
know
what
the
rest
of
you
are
going
to
do
but
i
going
down
these
steps
and
along
this
passage
if
we
find
the
good
hotel
well
a
good
hotel
never
hurt
any
one
yet
it
no
good
you
know
said
jimmy
weakly
you
know
jolly
well
you
ca
get
out
of
that
temple
of
flora
door
even
if
you
get
to
it
i
know
said
gerald
still
brisk
and
a
secret
spring
inside
that
door
most
likely
we
had
a
lamp
last
time
to
look
for
it
remember
if
there
one
thing
i
do
hate
it
said
mabel
not
a
coward
said
gerald
with
what
is
known
as
diplomacy
brave
mabel
do
i
know
it
you
hold
jimmy
hand
and
hold
cathy
now
then
i
wo
have
hand
held
said
jimmy
of
course
i
not
a
kid
well
cathy
will
poor
little
cathy
nice
brother
jerry
hold
poor
cathy
hand
gerald
bitter
sarcasm
missed
fire
here
for
cathy
gratefully
caught
the
hand
he
held
out
in
mockery
she
was
too
miserable
to
read
his
mood
as
she
mostly
did
oh
thank
you
jerry
dear
she
said
gratefully
you
a
dear
and
i
try
not
to
be
frightened
and
for
quite
a
minute
gerald
shamedly
felt
that
he
had
not
been
quite
quite
kind
so
now
leaving
the
growing
goldness
of
the
sunrise
the
four
went
down
the
stone
steps
that
led
to
the
underground
and
underwater
passage
and
everything
seemed
to
grow
dark
and
then
to
grow
into
a
poor
pretence
of
light
again
as
the
splendour
of
dawn
gave
place
to
the
small
dogged
lighting
of
the
bicycle
lamp
the
steps
did
indeed
lead
to
a
passage
the
beginnings
of
it
choked
with
the
drifted
dead
leaves
of
many
old
autumns
but
presently
the
passage
took
a
turn
there
were
more
steps
down
down
and
then
the
passage
was
empty
and
straight
lined
above
and
below
and
on
each
side
with
slabs
of
marble
very
clear
and
clean
gerald
held
cathy
hand
with
more
of
kindness
and
less
of
exasperation
than
he
had
supposed
possible
and
cathy
on
her
part
was
surprised
to
find
it
possible
to
be
so
much
less
frightened
than
she
expected
the
flame
of
the
threw
ahead
a
soft
circle
of
misty
light
the
children
followed
it
silently
till
silently
and
suddenly
the
light
of
the
behaved
as
the
flame
of
a
candle
does
when
you
take
it
out
into
the
sunlight
to
light
a
bonfire
or
explode
a
train
of
gunpowder
or
what
not
because
now
with
feelings
mixed
indeed
of
wonder
and
interest
and
awe
but
no
fear
the
children
found
themselves
in
a
great
hall
whose
arched
roof
was
held
up
by
two
rows
of
round
pillars
and
whose
every
corner
was
filled
with
a
soft
searching
lovely
light
filling
every
cranny
as
water
fills
the
rocky
secrecies
of
hidden
how
beautiful
kathleen
whispered
breathing
hard
into
the
tickled
ear
of
her
brother
and
mabel
caught
the
hand
of
jimmy
and
whispered
i
must
hold
your
hand
i
must
hold
on
to
something
silly
or
i
believe
it
real
for
this
hall
in
which
the
children
found
themselves
was
the
most
beautiful
place
in
the
world
i
wo
describe
it
because
it
does
not
look
the
same
to
any
two
people
and
you
would
understand
me
if
i
tried
to
tell
you
how
it
looked
to
any
one
of
these
four
but
to
each
it
seemed
the
most
perfect
thing
possible
i
will
only
say
that
all
round
it
were
great
arches
kathleen
saw
them
as
moorish
mabel
as
tudor
gerald
as
norman
and
jimmy
as
churchwarden
gothic
if
you
do
know
what
these
are
ask
your
uncle
who
collects
brasses
and
he
will
explain
or
perhaps
millar
will
draw
the
different
kinds
of
arches
for
you
and
through
these
arches
one
could
see
many
things
oh
but
many
things
through
one
appeared
an
olive
garden
and
in
it
two
lovers
who
held
each
other
hands
under
an
italian
moon
through
another
a
wild
sea
and
a
ship
to
whom
the
wild
racing
sea
was
slave
a
third
showed
a
king
on
his
throne
his
courtiers
obsequious
about
him
and
yet
a
fourth
showed
a
really
good
hotel
with
the
respectable
sunning
himself
on
the
front
doorsteps
there
was
a
mother
bending
over
a
wooden
cradle
there
was
an
artist
gazing
entranced
on
the
picture
his
wet
brush
seemed
to
have
that
moment
completed
a
general
dying
on
a
field
where
victory
had
planted
the
standard
he
loved
and
these
things
were
not
pictures
but
the
truest
truths
alive
and
as
anyone
could
see
immortal
many
other
pictures
there
were
that
these
arches
framed
and
all
showed
some
moment
when
life
had
sprung
to
fire
and
flower
the
best
that
the
soul
of
man
could
ask
or
man
destiny
grant
and
the
really
good
hotel
had
its
place
here
too
because
there
are
some
souls
that
ask
no
higher
thing
of
life
than
a
really
good
hotel
oh
i
am
glad
we
came
i
am
i
am
kathleen
murmured
and
held
fast
to
her
brother
hand
they
went
slowly
up
the
hall
the
ineffectual
held
by
jimmy
very
crooked
indeed
showing
almost
as
a
shadow
in
this
big
glorious
light
and
then
when
the
hall
end
was
almost
reached
the
children
saw
where
the
light
came
from
it
glowed
and
spread
itself
from
one
place
and
in
that
place
stood
the
one
statue
that
mabel
did
not
know
where
to
find
the
statue
of
psyche
they
went
on
slowly
quite
happy
quite
bewildered
and
when
they
came
close
to
psyche
they
saw
that
on
her
raised
hand
the
ring
showed
dark
gerald
let
go
kathleen
hand
put
his
foot
on
the
pediment
his
knee
on
the
pedestal
he
stood
up
dark
and
human
beside
the
white
girl
with
the
butterfly
wings
i
do
hope
you
do
mind
he
said
and
drew
the
ring
off
very
gently
then
as
he
dropped
to
the
ground
not
here
he
said
i
do
know
why
but
not
here
and
they
all
passed
behind
the
white
psyche
and
once
more
the
bicycle
lamp
seemed
suddenly
to
come
to
life
again
as
gerald
held
it
in
front
of
him
to
be
the
pioneer
in
the
dark
passage
that
led
from
the
hall
of
but
they
did
not
know
then
what
it
was
the
hall
of
then
as
the
twisting
passage
shut
in
on
them
with
a
darkness
that
pressed
close
against
the
little
light
of
the
bicycle
lamp
kathleen
said
give
me
the
ring
i
know
exactly
what
to
say
gerald
gave
it
with
not
extreme
readiness
i
wish
said
kathleen
slowly
that
no
one
at
home
may
know
that
been
out
and
i
wish
we
were
safe
in
our
own
beds
undressed
and
in
our
nightgowns
and
asleep
and
the
next
thing
any
of
them
knew
it
was
good
strong
ordinary
daylight
not
just
sunrise
but
the
kind
of
daylight
you
are
used
to
being
called
in
and
all
were
in
their
own
beds
kathleen
had
framed
the
wish
most
sensibly
the
only
mistake
had
been
in
saying
in
our
own
beds
because
of
course
mabel
own
bed
was
at
yalding
towers
and
to
this
day
mabel
aunt
can
not
understand
how
mabel
who
was
staying
the
night
with
that
child
in
the
town
she
was
so
taken
up
with
had
come
home
at
eleven
when
the
aunt
locked
up
and
yet
she
was
in
her
bed
in
the
morning
for
though
not
a
clever
woman
she
was
not
stupid
enough
to
be
able
to
believe
any
one
of
the
eleven
fancy
explanations
which
the
distracted
mabel
offered
in
the
course
of
the
morning
the
first
which
makes
twelve
of
these
explanations
was
the
truth
and
of
course
the
aunt
was
far
too
clever
to
believe
that
chapter
xi
it
was
at
yalding
castle
and
it
seemed
good
to
the
children
to
go
and
visit
mabel
and
as
gerald
put
it
to
mingle
unsuspected
with
the
crowd
to
gloat
over
all
the
things
which
they
knew
and
which
the
crowd
did
know
about
the
castle
and
the
sliding
panels
the
magic
ring
and
the
statues
that
came
alive
perhaps
one
of
the
pleasantest
things
about
magic
happenings
is
the
feeling
which
they
give
you
of
knowing
what
other
people
not
only
do
know
but
would
so
to
speak
believe
if
they
did
on
the
white
road
outside
the
gates
of
the
castle
was
a
dark
spattering
of
breaks
and
wagonettes
and
three
or
four
waiting
puffed
fatly
where
they
stood
and
bicycles
sprawled
in
heaps
along
the
grassy
hollow
by
the
red
brick
wall
and
the
people
who
had
been
brought
to
the
castle
by
the
breaks
and
wagonettes
and
and
bicycles
and
motors
as
well
as
those
who
had
walked
there
on
their
own
unaided
feet
were
scattered
about
the
grounds
or
being
shown
over
those
parts
of
the
castle
which
were
on
this
one
day
of
the
week
thrown
open
to
visitors
there
were
more
visitors
than
usual
because
it
had
somehow
been
whispered
about
that
lord
yalding
was
down
and
that
the
holland
covers
were
to
be
taken
off
the
state
furniture
so
that
a
rich
american
who
wished
to
rent
the
castle
to
live
in
might
see
the
place
in
all
its
glory
it
certainly
did
look
very
splendid
the
embroidered
satin
gilded
leather
and
tapestry
of
the
chairs
which
had
been
hidden
by
brown
holland
gave
to
the
rooms
a
pleasant
air
of
being
lived
in
there
were
flowering
plants
and
pots
of
roses
here
and
there
on
tables
or
mabel
aunt
prided
herself
on
her
tasteful
touch
in
the
home
and
had
studied
the
arrangement
of
flowers
in
a
series
of
articles
in
called
how
to
make
home
on
ninepence
a
week
the
great
crystal
chandeliers
released
from
the
bags
that
at
ordinary
times
shrouded
them
gleamed
with
grey
and
purple
splendour
the
brown
linen
sheets
had
been
taken
off
the
state
beds
and
the
red
ropes
that
usually
kept
the
low
crowd
in
its
proper
place
had
been
rolled
up
and
hidden
away
it
exactly
as
if
we
were
calling
on
the
family
said
the
daughter
from
salisbury
to
her
friend
who
was
in
the
millinery
if
the
yankee
does
take
it
what
do
you
say
to
you
and
me
setting
up
here
when
we
get
spliced
the
draper
assistant
asked
his
sweetheart
and
she
said
oh
reggie
how
can
you
you
are
funny
all
the
afternoon
the
crowd
in
its
smart
holiday
clothes
pink
blouses
and
suits
flowery
hats
and
scarves
beyond
description
passed
through
and
through
the
dark
hall
the
magnificent
and
boudoirs
and
the
chattering
crowd
was
awed
into
something
like
quiet
by
the
calm
stately
bedchambers
where
men
had
been
born
and
died
where
royal
guests
had
lain
in
summer
nights
with
big
of
set
on
the
hearth
to
ward
off
fever
and
evil
spells
the
terrace
where
in
old
days
dames
in
ruffs
had
sniffed
the
sweetbrier
and
southernwood
of
the
borders
below
and
ladies
bright
with
rouge
and
powder
and
brocade
had
walked
in
the
swing
of
their
hooped
skirts
the
terrace
now
echoed
to
the
sound
of
brown
boots
and
the
of
shoes
at
two
and
eleven
three
and
high
laughter
and
chattering
voices
that
said
nothing
that
the
children
wanted
to
hear
these
spoiled
for
them
the
quiet
of
the
enchanted
castle
and
outraged
the
peace
of
the
garden
of
enchantments
it
is
such
a
lark
after
all
gerald
admitted
as
from
the
window
of
the
stone
at
the
end
of
the
terrace
they
watched
the
loud
colours
and
heard
the
loud
laughter
i
do
hate
to
see
all
these
people
in
garden
i
said
that
to
that
nice
this
morning
said
mabel
setting
herself
on
the
stone
floor
and
he
said
it
was
much
to
let
them
come
once
a
week
he
said
lord
yalding
ought
to
let
them
come
when
they
liked
said
he
would
if
he
lived
there
that
all
he
knows
said
jimmy
did
he
say
anything
else
lots
said
mabel
i
do
like
him
i
told
him
you
did
yes
i
told
him
lots
about
our
adventures
the
humble
bailiff
is
a
beautiful
listener
we
shall
be
locked
up
for
beautiful
lunatics
if
you
let
your
jaw
get
the
better
of
you
my
mabel
child
not
us
said
mabel
i
told
it
you
know
the
way
every
word
true
and
yet
so
that
nobody
believes
any
of
it
when
i
quite
done
he
said
got
a
real
littery
talent
and
i
promised
to
put
his
name
on
the
beginning
of
the
first
book
i
write
when
i
grow
up
you
do
know
his
name
said
kathleen
let
do
something
with
the
ring
imposs
said
gerald
i
forgot
to
tell
you
but
i
met
mademoiselle
when
i
went
back
for
my
garters
and
she
coming
to
meet
us
and
walk
back
with
us
what
did
you
say
i
said
said
gerald
deliberately
that
it
was
very
kind
of
her
and
so
it
was
us
not
wanting
her
does
make
it
not
kind
her
coming
it
may
be
kind
but
it
sickening
too
said
mabel
because
now
i
suppose
we
shall
have
to
stick
here
and
wait
for
her
and
i
promised
we
meet
the
he
going
to
bring
things
in
a
basket
and
have
a
with
us
where
beyond
the
dinosaurus
he
said
he
tell
me
all
about
the
animals
it
means
before
noah
ark
there
are
lots
besides
the
dinosaurus
in
return
for
me
telling
him
my
agreeable
fictions
yes
he
called
them
that
when
as
soon
as
the
gates
shut
that
five
we
might
take
mademoiselle
along
suggested
gerald
she
be
too
proud
to
have
tea
with
a
bailiff
i
expect
you
never
know
how
will
take
the
simplest
things
it
was
kathleen
who
said
this
well
i
tell
you
what
said
gerald
lazily
turning
on
the
stone
bench
you
all
go
along
and
meet
your
bailiff
a
picnic
a
picnic
and
i
wait
for
mademoiselle
mabel
remarked
joyously
that
this
was
jolly
decent
of
gerald
to
which
he
modestly
replied
oh
rot
jimmy
added
that
gerald
rather
liked
to
people
little
boys
do
understand
diplomacy
said
gerald
calmly
is
simply
silly
but
it
better
to
be
good
than
pretty
and
how
do
you
know
jimmy
asked
and
his
brother
went
on
you
never
know
when
a
may
come
in
useful
besides
they
it
you
must
give
them
little
pleasures
think
how
awful
it
must
be
to
be
old
my
hat
i
hope
sha
be
an
old
maid
said
kathleen
i
do
to
be
said
mabel
briskly
i
rather
marry
a
travelling
tinker
it
would
be
rather
nice
kathleen
mused
to
marry
the
gipsy
king
and
go
about
in
a
caravan
telling
fortunes
and
hung
round
with
baskets
and
brooms
oh
if
i
could
choose
said
mabel
of
course
i
marry
a
brigand
and
live
in
his
mountain
fastnesses
and
be
kind
to
his
captives
and
help
them
to
escape
and
you
be
a
real
treasure
to
your
husband
said
gerald
yes
said
kathleen
or
a
sailor
would
be
nice
you
watch
for
his
ship
coming
home
and
set
the
lamp
in
the
dormer
window
to
light
him
home
through
the
storm
and
when
he
was
drowned
at
sea
you
be
most
frightfully
sorry
and
go
every
day
to
lay
flowers
on
his
daisied
grave
yes
mabel
hastened
to
say
or
a
soldier
and
then
you
go
to
the
wars
with
short
petticoats
and
a
cocked
hat
and
a
barrel
round
your
neck
like
a
bernard
dog
there
a
picture
of
a
soldier
wife
on
a
song
auntie
got
it
called
veevandyear
when
i
marry
kathleen
quickly
said
when
marry
said
gerald
i
marry
a
dumb
girl
or
else
get
the
ring
to
make
her
so
that
she
ca
speak
unless
she
spoken
to
have
a
squint
he
applied
his
eye
to
the
stone
lattice
they
moving
off
he
said
those
pink
and
purple
hats
are
nodding
off
in
the
distant
prospect
and
the
funny
little
man
with
the
beard
like
a
goat
is
going
a
different
way
from
every
one
else
the
gardeners
will
have
to
head
him
off
i
do
see
mademoiselle
though
the
rest
of
you
had
better
bunk
it
does
do
to
run
any
risks
with
picnics
the
deserted
hero
of
our
tale
alone
and
unsupported
urged
on
his
brave
followers
to
pursue
the
commissariat
waggons
he
himself
remaining
at
the
post
of
danger
and
difficulty
because
he
was
born
to
stand
on
burning
decks
whence
all
but
he
had
fled
and
to
lead
forlorn
hopes
when
despaired
of
by
the
human
race
i
think
i
marry
a
dumb
husband
said
mabel
and
there
sha
be
any
heroes
in
my
books
when
i
write
them
only
a
heroine
come
on
cathy
coming
out
of
that
cool
shadowy
into
the
sunshine
was
like
stepping
into
an
oven
and
the
stone
of
the
terrace
was
burning
to
the
children
feet
i
know
now
what
a
cat
on
hot
bricks
feels
like
said
jimmy
the
antediluvian
animals
are
set
in
a
on
a
slope
at
least
half
a
mile
across
the
park
from
the
castle
the
grandfather
of
the
present
lord
yalding
had
them
set
there
in
the
middle
of
last
century
in
the
great
days
of
the
late
prince
consort
the
exhibition
of
sir
joseph
paxton
and
the
crystal
palace
their
stone
flanks
their
wide
ungainly
wings
their
lozenged
backs
show
grey
through
the
trees
a
long
way
off
most
people
think
that
noon
is
the
hottest
time
of
the
day
they
are
wrong
a
cloudless
sky
gets
hotter
and
hotter
all
the
afternoon
and
reaches
its
very
hottest
at
five
i
am
sure
you
must
all
have
noticed
this
when
you
are
going
out
to
tea
anywhere
in
your
best
clothes
especially
if
your
clothes
are
starched
and
you
happen
to
have
a
rather
long
and
shadeless
walk
kathleen
mabel
and
jimmy
got
hotter
and
hotter
and
went
more
and
more
slowly
they
had
almost
reached
that
stage
of
resentment
and
discomfort
when
one
wishes
one
had
come
before
they
saw
below
the
edge
of
the
the
white
waved
handkerchief
of
the
bailiff
that
banner
eloquent
of
tea
shade
and
being
able
to
sit
down
put
new
heart
into
them
they
mended
their
pace
and
a
final
desperate
run
landed
them
among
the
drifted
coppery
leaves
and
bare
grey
and
green
roots
of
the
oh
glory
said
jimmy
throwing
himself
down
how
do
you
do
the
bailiff
looked
very
nice
the
girls
thought
he
was
not
wearing
his
velveteens
but
a
grey
flannel
suit
that
an
earl
need
not
have
scorned
and
his
straw
hat
would
have
done
no
discredit
to
a
duke
and
a
prince
could
not
have
worn
a
prettier
green
tie
he
welcomed
the
children
warmly
and
there
were
two
baskets
dumped
heavy
and
promising
among
the
he
was
a
man
of
tact
the
hot
instructive
tour
of
the
stone
antediluvians
which
had
loomed
with
charm
before
the
children
was
not
even
mentioned
you
must
be
he
said
and
you
be
hungry
too
when
you
done
being
thirsty
i
put
on
the
kettle
as
soon
as
i
discerned
the
form
of
my
fair
romancer
in
the
extreme
offing
the
kettle
introduced
itself
with
puffings
and
bubblings
from
the
hollow
between
two
grey
roots
where
it
sat
on
a
take
off
your
shoes
and
stockings
wo
you
said
the
bailiff
in
tones
just
as
old
ladies
ask
each
other
to
take
off
their
bonnets
there
a
little
baby
canal
just
over
the
ridge
the
joys
of
dipping
one
feet
in
cool
running
water
after
a
hot
walk
have
yet
to
be
described
i
could
write
pages
about
them
there
was
a
when
i
was
young
with
little
fishes
in
it
and
dropped
leaves
that
spun
round
and
willows
and
alders
that
leaned
over
it
and
kept
it
cool
and
but
this
is
not
the
story
of
life
illustration
the
joys
of
dipping
one
feet
in
cool
running
water
when
they
came
back
on
rested
damp
pink
feet
tea
was
made
and
poured
out
delicious
tea
with
as
much
milk
as
ever
you
wanted
out
of
a
beer
bottle
with
a
screw
top
and
cakes
and
gingerbread
and
plums
and
a
big
melon
with
a
lump
of
ice
in
its
heart
a
tea
for
the
gods
this
thought
must
have
come
to
jimmy
for
he
said
suddenly
removing
his
face
from
inside
a
crescent
of
your
feast
as
good
as
the
feast
of
the
immortals
almost
explain
your
recondite
allusion
said
the
host
and
jimmy
understanding
him
to
say
what
do
you
mean
replied
with
the
whole
tale
of
that
wonderful
night
when
the
statues
came
alive
and
a
banquet
of
unearthly
splendour
and
deliciousness
was
plucked
by
marble
hands
from
the
trees
of
the
lake
island
when
he
had
done
the
bailiff
said
did
you
get
all
this
out
of
a
book
no
said
jimmy
it
happened
you
are
an
imaginative
set
of
young
dreamers
are
you
the
bailiff
asked
handing
the
plums
to
kathleen
who
smiled
friendly
but
embarrassed
why
could
jimmy
have
held
his
tongue
no
we
not
said
that
indiscreet
one
obstinately
everything
told
you
happen
and
so
did
the
things
mabel
told
you
the
bailiff
looked
a
little
uncomfortable
all
right
old
chap
he
said
and
there
was
a
short
uneasy
silence
look
here
said
jimmy
who
seemed
for
once
to
have
got
the
bit
between
his
teeth
do
you
believe
me
or
not
do
be
silly
jimmy
kathleen
whispered
because
if
you
do
i
you
believe
do
said
mabel
and
kathleen
together
do
you
or
do
you
jimmy
insisted
lying
on
his
front
with
his
chin
on
his
hands
his
elbows
on
a
and
his
bare
legs
kicking
among
the
i
think
you
tell
adventures
awfully
well
said
the
bailiff
cautiously
very
well
said
jimmy
abruptly
sitting
up
you
do
believe
me
nonsense
cathy
he
a
gentleman
even
if
he
is
a
bailiff
thank
you
said
the
bailiff
with
eyes
that
twinkled
you
wo
tell
will
you
jimmy
urged
tell
what
certainly
not
i
am
as
you
say
the
soul
of
honour
then
cathy
give
me
the
ring
oh
said
the
girls
together
kathleen
did
not
mean
to
give
up
the
ring
mabel
did
not
mean
that
she
should
jimmy
certainly
used
no
force
yet
presently
he
held
it
in
his
hand
it
was
his
hour
there
are
times
like
that
for
all
of
us
when
what
we
say
shall
be
done
done
now
said
jimmy
this
is
the
ring
mabel
told
you
about
i
say
it
is
a
and
if
you
will
put
it
on
your
hand
and
wish
whatever
you
wish
will
happen
must
i
wish
out
loud
yes
i
think
so
do
wish
for
anything
silly
said
kathleen
making
the
best
of
the
situation
like
its
being
fine
on
tuesday
or
its
being
your
favourite
pudding
for
dinner
wish
for
something
you
really
want
i
will
said
the
bailiff
i
wish
for
the
only
thing
i
really
want
i
wish
my
i
wish
my
friend
were
here
the
three
who
knew
the
power
of
the
ring
looked
round
to
see
the
bailiff
friend
appear
a
surprised
man
that
friend
would
be
they
thought
and
perhaps
a
frightened
one
they
had
all
risen
and
stood
ready
to
soothe
and
reassure
the
but
no
startled
gentleman
appeared
in
the
wood
only
coming
quietly
through
the
dappled
sun
and
shadow
under
the
mademoiselle
and
gerald
mademoiselle
in
a
white
gown
looking
quite
nice
and
like
a
picture
gerald
hot
and
polite
said
that
dauntless
leader
of
forlorn
hopes
i
persuaded
mademoiselle
that
sentence
was
never
finished
for
the
bailiff
and
the
french
governess
were
looking
at
each
other
with
the
eyes
of
tired
travellers
who
find
quite
without
expecting
it
the
desired
end
of
a
very
long
journey
and
the
children
saw
that
even
if
they
spoke
it
would
not
make
any
difference
said
the
bailiff
mais
donc
vous
said
mademoiselle
in
a
funny
choky
voice
illustration
they
stood
still
and
looked
at
each
other
and
they
stood
still
and
looked
at
each
other
like
stuck
pigs
as
jimmy
said
later
for
quite
a
long
time
is
your
friend
jimmy
asked
yes
oh
yes
said
this
bailiff
you
are
my
friend
are
you
not
but
yes
mademoiselle
said
softly
i
am
your
friend
there
you
see
said
jimmy
the
ring
do
what
i
said
we
wo
quarrel
about
that
said
the
bailiff
you
can
say
it
the
ring
for
me
it
a
coincidence
the
happiest
the
dearest
then
you
said
the
french
governess
of
course
said
the
bailiff
jimmy
give
your
brother
some
tea
mademoiselle
come
and
walk
in
the
woods
there
are
a
thousand
things
to
say
eat
then
my
gerald
said
mademoiselle
now
grown
young
and
astonishingly
like
a
fairy
princess
i
return
all
at
the
hour
and
we
together
it
is
that
we
must
speak
each
other
it
is
long
time
that
we
have
not
seen
us
me
and
lord
yalding
so
he
was
lord
yalding
all
the
time
said
jimmy
breaking
a
stupefied
silence
as
the
white
gown
and
the
grey
flannels
disappeared
among
the
landscape
painter
sort
of
dodge
silly
i
call
it
and
fancy
her
being
a
friend
of
his
and
his
wishing
she
was
here
different
from
us
eh
good
old
ring
his
friend
said
mabel
with
strong
scorn
do
you
see
she
his
lover
do
you
see
she
the
lady
that
was
bricked
up
in
the
convent
because
he
was
so
poor
and
he
could
find
her
and
now
the
made
them
live
happy
ever
after
i
glad
are
you
cathy
rather
said
kathleen
it
as
good
as
marrying
a
sailor
or
a
bandit
it
the
ring
did
it
said
jimmy
if
the
american
takes
the
house
he
pay
lots
of
rent
and
they
can
live
on
that
i
wonder
if
they
be
married
said
mabel
would
it
be
fun
if
we
were
bridesmaids
said
cathy
may
i
trouble
you
for
the
melon
said
gerald
thanks
why
did
we
know
he
was
lord
yalding
apes
and
moles
that
we
were
known
since
last
night
said
mabel
calmly
only
i
promised
not
to
tell
i
keep
a
secret
ca
i
too
jolly
well
said
kathleen
a
little
aggrieved
he
was
disguised
as
a
bailiff
said
jimmy
that
why
we
know
disguised
as
a
said
gerald
ha
ha
i
see
something
old
sherlock
holmes
never
saw
nor
that
idiot
watson
either
if
you
want
a
really
impenetrable
disguise
you
ought
to
disguise
yourself
as
what
you
really
are
i
remember
that
it
like
mabel
telling
things
so
that
you
ca
believe
them
said
cathy
i
think
mademoiselle
jolly
lucky
said
mabel
she
not
so
bad
he
might
have
done
worse
said
gerald
plums
please
there
was
quite
plainly
magic
at
work
mademoiselle
next
morning
was
a
changed
governess
her
cheeks
were
pink
her
lips
were
red
her
eyes
were
larger
and
brighter
and
she
had
done
her
hair
in
an
entirely
new
way
rather
frivolous
and
very
becoming
mamselle
coming
out
eliza
remarked
immediately
after
breakfast
lord
yalding
called
with
a
wagonette
that
wore
a
smart
blue
cloth
coat
and
was
drawn
by
two
horses
whose
coats
were
brown
and
shining
and
fitted
them
even
better
than
the
blue
cloth
coat
fitted
the
wagonette
and
the
whole
party
drove
in
state
and
splendour
to
yalding
towers
arrived
there
the
children
clamoured
for
permission
to
explore
the
castle
thoroughly
a
thing
that
had
never
yet
been
possible
lord
yalding
a
little
absent
in
manner
but
yet
quite
cordial
consented
mabel
showed
the
others
all
the
secret
doors
and
unlikely
passages
and
stairs
that
she
had
discovered
it
was
a
glorious
morning
lord
yalding
and
mademoiselle
went
through
the
house
it
is
true
but
in
a
rather
way
quite
soon
they
were
tired
and
went
out
through
the
french
windows
of
the
and
through
the
rose
garden
to
sit
on
the
curved
stone
seat
in
the
middle
of
the
maze
where
once
at
the
beginning
of
things
gerald
kathleen
and
jimmy
had
found
the
sleeping
princess
who
wore
pink
silk
and
diamonds
the
children
felt
that
their
going
left
to
the
castle
a
more
spacious
freedom
and
explored
with
more
than
arctic
enthusiasm
it
was
as
they
emerged
from
the
little
rickety
secret
staircase
that
led
from
the
of
the
state
suite
to
the
gallery
of
the
hall
that
they
came
suddenly
face
to
face
with
the
odd
little
man
who
had
a
beard
like
a
goat
and
had
taken
the
wrong
turning
yesterday
this
part
of
the
castle
is
private
said
mabel
with
great
presence
of
mind
and
shut
the
door
behind
her
i
am
aware
of
it
said
the
stranger
but
i
have
the
permission
of
the
earl
of
yalding
to
examine
the
house
my
leisure
oh
said
mabel
i
beg
your
pardon
we
all
do
we
did
know
you
are
relatives
of
his
lordship
i
should
surmise
asked
the
not
exactly
said
gerald
friends
the
gentleman
was
thin
and
very
neatly
dressed
he
had
small
merry
eyes
and
a
face
that
was
brown
and
you
are
playing
some
game
i
should
suppose
no
sir
said
gerald
only
exploring
may
a
stranger
propose
himself
as
a
member
of
your
exploring
expedition
asked
the
gentleman
smiling
a
tight
but
kind
smile
the
children
looked
at
each
other
you
see
said
gerald
it
rather
difficult
to
explain
but
you
see
what
i
mean
do
you
he
means
said
jimmy
that
we
ca
take
you
into
an
exploring
party
without
we
know
what
you
want
to
go
for
are
you
a
photographer
asked
mabel
or
is
it
some
newspaper
sent
you
to
write
about
the
towers
i
understand
your
position
said
the
gentleman
i
am
not
a
photographer
nor
am
i
engaged
by
any
journal
i
am
a
man
of
independent
means
travelling
in
this
country
with
the
intention
of
renting
a
residence
my
name
is
jefferson
d
conway
oh
said
mabel
then
you
the
american
millionaire
i
do
not
like
the
description
young
lady
said
jefferson
conway
i
am
an
american
citizen
and
i
am
not
without
means
this
is
a
fine
property
a
very
fine
property
if
it
were
for
sale
it
is
it
ca
be
mabel
hastened
to
explain
the
lawyers
have
put
it
in
a
tale
so
lord
yalding
ca
sell
it
but
you
could
take
it
to
live
in
and
pay
lord
yalding
a
good
millionairish
rent
and
then
he
could
marry
the
french
governess
shish
said
kathleen
and
jefferson
conway
together
and
he
added
lead
the
way
please
and
i
should
suggest
that
the
exploration
be
complete
and
exhaustive
thus
encouraged
mabel
led
the
millionaire
through
all
the
castle
he
seemed
pleased
yet
disappointed
too
it
is
a
fine
mansion
he
said
at
last
when
they
had
come
back
to
the
point
from
which
they
had
started
but
i
should
suppose
in
a
house
this
size
there
would
mostly
be
a
secret
stairway
or
a
priests
hiding
place
or
a
ghost
there
are
said
mabel
briefly
but
i
thought
americans
did
believe
in
anything
but
machinery
and
newspapers
she
touched
the
spring
of
the
panel
behind
her
and
displayed
the
little
tottery
staircase
to
the
american
the
sight
of
it
worked
a
wonderful
transformation
in
him
he
became
eager
alert
very
keen
say
he
cried
over
and
over
again
standing
in
the
door
that
led
from
the
to
the
state
but
this
is
great
great
the
hopes
of
every
one
ran
high
it
seemed
almost
certain
that
the
castle
would
be
let
for
a
millionairish
rent
and
lord
yalding
be
made
affluent
to
the
point
of
marriage
if
there
were
a
ghost
located
in
this
ancestral
pile
i
close
with
the
earl
of
yalding
now
on
the
nail
jefferson
conway
went
on
if
you
were
to
stay
till
and
sleep
in
this
room
i
expect
you
see
the
ghost
said
mabel
there
a
ghost
located
here
then
he
said
joyously
illustration
he
became
eager
alert
very
keen
they
say
mabel
answered
that
old
sir
rupert
who
lost
his
head
in
henry
the
eighth
time
walks
of
a
night
here
with
his
head
under
his
arm
but
we
not
seen
that
what
we
have
seen
is
the
lady
in
a
pink
dress
with
diamonds
in
her
hair
she
carries
a
lighted
taper
mabel
hastily
added
the
others
now
suddenly
aware
of
mabel
plan
hastened
to
assure
the
american
in
accents
of
earnest
truth
that
they
had
all
seen
the
lady
with
the
pink
gown
he
looked
at
them
with
eyes
that
twinkled
well
he
said
i
calculate
to
ask
the
earl
of
yalding
to
permit
me
to
pass
a
night
in
his
ancestral
best
and
if
i
hear
so
much
as
a
phantom
footstep
or
hear
so
much
as
a
ghostly
sigh
i
take
the
place
i
glad
said
cathy
you
appear
to
be
very
certain
of
your
ghost
said
the
american
still
fixing
them
with
little
eyes
that
shone
let
me
tell
you
young
gentlemen
that
i
carry
a
gun
and
when
i
see
a
ghost
i
shoot
he
pulled
a
pistol
out
of
his
and
looked
at
it
lovingly
and
i
am
a
fair
average
shot
he
went
on
walking
across
the
shiny
floor
of
the
state
to
the
open
window
see
that
big
red
rose
like
a
they
saw
the
next
moment
a
loud
report
broke
the
stillness
and
the
red
petals
of
the
shattered
rose
strewed
balustrade
and
terrace
the
american
looked
from
one
child
to
another
every
face
was
perfectly
white
jefferson
conway
made
his
little
pile
by
strict
attention
to
business
and
keeping
his
eyes
skinned
he
added
thank
you
for
all
your
kindness
suppose
you
done
it
and
he
shot
you
said
jimmy
cheerfully
that
have
been
an
adventure
would
it
i
going
to
do
it
still
said
mabel
pale
and
defiant
let
find
lord
yalding
and
get
the
ring
back
lord
yalding
had
had
an
interview
with
mabel
aunt
and
lunch
for
six
was
laid
in
the
great
dark
hall
among
the
armour
and
the
oak
furniture
a
beautiful
lunch
served
on
silver
dishes
mademoiselle
becoming
every
moment
younger
and
more
like
a
princess
was
moved
to
tears
when
gerald
rose
in
hand
and
proposed
the
health
of
lord
and
lady
yalding
when
lord
yalding
had
returned
thanks
in
a
speech
full
of
agreeable
jokes
the
moment
seemed
to
gerald
propitious
and
he
said
the
ring
you
know
you
do
believe
in
it
but
we
do
may
we
have
it
back
and
got
it
then
after
a
hasty
council
held
in
the
panelled
mabel
said
this
is
a
and
i
wish
all
the
american
weapons
of
all
sorts
were
here
instantly
the
room
was
full
six
feet
up
the
wall
of
a
tangle
and
mass
of
weapons
swords
spears
arrows
tomahawks
fowling
pieces
blunderbusses
pistols
revolvers
scimitars
kreeses
every
kind
of
weapon
you
can
think
of
and
the
four
children
wedged
in
among
all
these
weapons
of
death
hardly
dared
to
breathe
he
collects
arms
i
expect
said
gerald
and
the
arrows
are
poisoned
i
should
wonder
wish
them
back
where
they
came
from
mabel
for
goodness
sake
and
try
again
mabel
wished
the
weapons
away
and
at
once
the
four
children
stood
safe
in
a
bare
panelled
room
but
no
mabel
said
i
ca
stand
it
we
work
the
ghost
another
way
i
wish
the
american
may
think
he
sees
a
ghost
when
he
goes
to
bed
sir
rupert
with
his
head
under
his
arm
will
do
is
it
he
sleeps
there
i
do
know
i
wish
he
may
see
sir
rupert
every
night
that
make
it
all
serene
it
rather
dull
said
gerald
we
sha
know
whether
he
seen
sir
rupert
or
not
we
shall
know
in
the
morning
when
he
takes
the
house
this
being
settled
mabel
aunt
was
found
to
be
desirous
of
company
so
the
others
went
home
it
was
when
they
were
at
supper
that
lord
yalding
suddenly
appeared
and
said
jefferson
conway
wants
you
boys
to
spend
the
night
with
him
in
the
state
chamber
i
had
beds
put
up
you
do
mind
do
you
he
seems
to
think
you
got
some
idea
of
playing
on
him
it
was
difficult
to
refuse
so
difficult
that
it
proved
impossible
ten
found
the
boys
each
in
a
narrow
white
bed
that
looked
quite
absurdly
small
in
that
high
dark
chamber
and
in
face
of
that
tall
gaunt
hung
with
tapestry
and
ornamented
with
plumes
i
hope
to
goodness
there
is
a
ghost
jimmy
whispered
not
likely
gerald
whispered
back
but
i
do
want
to
see
sir
rupert
ghost
with
its
head
under
its
arm
jimmy
insisted
you
wo
the
most
you
see
be
the
millionaire
seeing
it
mabel
said
he
was
to
see
it
not
us
very
likely
you
sleep
all
night
and
not
see
anything
shut
your
eyes
and
count
up
to
a
million
and
do
be
a
goat
but
he
was
reckoning
without
mabel
and
the
ring
as
soon
as
mabel
had
learned
from
her
aunt
that
this
was
indeed
the
night
when
jefferson
conway
would
sleep
at
the
castle
she
had
hastened
to
add
a
wish
that
sir
rupert
and
his
head
may
appear
in
the
state
bedroom
jimmy
shut
his
eyes
and
began
to
count
a
million
before
he
had
counted
it
he
fell
asleep
so
did
his
brother
they
were
awakened
by
the
loud
echoing
bang
of
a
pistol
shot
each
thought
of
the
shot
that
had
been
fired
that
morning
and
opened
eyes
that
expected
to
see
a
sunshiny
terrace
and
petals
strewn
upon
warm
white
stone
instead
there
was
the
dark
lofty
state
chamber
lighted
but
little
by
six
tall
candles
there
was
the
american
in
shirt
and
trousers
a
smoking
pistol
in
his
hand
and
there
advancing
from
the
door
of
the
a
figure
in
doublet
and
hose
a
ruff
round
its
neck
and
no
head
the
head
sure
enough
was
there
but
it
was
under
the
right
arm
held
close
in
the
sleeve
of
the
doublet
the
face
looking
from
under
the
arm
wore
a
pleasant
smile
both
boys
i
am
sorry
to
say
screamed
the
american
fired
again
the
bullet
passed
through
sir
rupert
who
advanced
without
appearing
to
notice
it
then
suddenly
the
lights
went
out
the
next
thing
the
boys
knew
it
was
morning
a
grey
daylight
shone
blankly
through
the
tall
windows
and
wild
rain
was
beating
upon
the
glass
and
the
american
was
gone
where
are
we
said
jimmy
sitting
up
with
tangled
hair
and
looking
round
him
oh
i
remember
ugh
it
was
horrid
i
about
fed
up
with
that
ring
so
i
do
mind
telling
you
illustration
the
american
fired
again
nonsense
said
gerald
i
enjoyed
it
i
was
a
bit
frightened
were
you
no
said
jimmy
of
course
i
was
we
done
the
trick
said
gerald
later
when
they
learned
that
the
american
had
breakfasted
early
with
lord
yalding
and
taken
the
first
train
to
london
he
gone
to
get
rid
of
his
other
house
and
take
this
one
the
old
ring
beginning
to
do
really
useful
things
perhaps
you
believe
in
the
ring
now
said
jimmy
to
lord
yalding
whom
he
met
later
on
in
the
it
all
our
doing
that
jefferson
saw
the
ghost
he
told
us
he
take
the
house
if
he
saw
a
ghost
so
of
course
we
took
care
he
did
see
one
oh
you
did
did
you
said
lord
yalding
in
rather
an
odd
voice
very
much
obliged
i
sure
do
mention
it
said
jimmy
kindly
i
thought
you
be
pleased
and
him
too
perhaps
you
be
interested
to
learn
said
lord
yalding
putting
his
hands
in
his
pockets
and
staring
down
at
jimmy
that
jefferson
conway
was
so
pleased
with
your
ghost
that
he
got
me
out
of
bed
at
six
this
morning
to
talk
about
it
oh
ripping
said
jimmy
what
did
he
say
he
said
as
far
as
i
can
remember
said
lord
yalding
still
in
the
same
strange
voice
he
said
lord
your
ancestral
pile
is
it
is
in
fact
the
limit
its
luxury
is
palatial
its
grounds
are
nothing
short
of
edenesque
no
expense
has
been
spared
i
should
surmise
your
ancestors
were
they
have
done
the
thing
as
it
should
be
done
every
detail
attended
to
i
like
your
tapestry
and
i
like
your
oak
and
i
like
your
secret
stairs
but
i
think
your
ancestors
should
have
left
well
enough
alone
and
stopped
at
that
so
i
said
they
had
as
far
as
i
knew
and
he
shook
his
head
and
said
sir
your
ancestors
take
the
air
of
a
night
with
their
heads
under
their
arms
a
ghost
that
sighed
or
glided
or
rustled
i
could
have
stood
and
thanked
you
for
it
and
considered
it
in
the
rent
but
a
ghost
that
bullets
go
through
while
it
stands
grinning
with
a
bare
neck
and
its
head
loose
under
its
own
arm
and
little
boys
screaming
and
fainting
in
their
beds
no
what
i
say
is
if
this
is
a
british
hereditary
family
ghost
excuse
me
and
he
went
off
by
the
early
train
i
say
the
stricken
jimmy
remarked
i
sorry
and
i
do
think
we
did
faint
really
i
do
but
we
thought
it
would
be
just
what
you
wanted
and
perhaps
some
one
else
will
take
the
house
i
do
know
any
one
else
rich
enough
said
lord
yalding
conway
came
the
day
before
he
said
he
would
or
you
never
have
got
hold
of
him
and
i
do
know
how
you
did
it
and
i
do
want
to
know
it
was
a
rather
silly
trick
there
was
a
gloomy
pause
the
rain
beat
against
the
long
windows
i
say
jimmy
looked
up
at
lord
yalding
with
the
light
of
a
new
idea
in
his
round
face
i
say
if
you
hard
up
why
do
you
sell
your
jewels
i
have
any
jewels
you
meddlesome
young
duffer
said
lord
yalding
quite
crossly
and
taking
his
hands
out
of
his
pockets
he
began
to
walk
away
i
mean
the
ones
in
the
panelled
room
with
the
stars
in
the
ceiling
jimmy
insisted
following
him
there
are
any
said
lord
yalding
shortly
and
if
this
is
some
more
i
advise
you
to
be
careful
young
man
i
had
about
as
much
as
i
care
for
it
said
jimmy
there
are
shelves
and
shelves
of
beautiful
family
jewels
you
can
sell
them
and
oh
cried
mademoiselle
appearing
like
an
oleograph
of
a
duchess
in
the
door
of
the
do
sell
the
family
jewels
there
are
any
my
lady
said
lord
yalding
going
towards
her
i
thought
you
were
never
coming
oh
are
there
said
mabel
who
had
followed
mademoiselle
you
just
come
and
see
let
us
see
what
they
will
to
show
us
cried
mademoiselle
for
lord
yalding
did
not
move
it
should
at
least
be
amusing
it
is
said
jimmy
so
they
went
mabel
and
jimmy
leading
while
mademoiselle
and
lord
yalding
followed
hand
in
hand
it
much
safer
to
walk
hand
in
hand
said
lord
yalding
with
these
children
at
large
one
never
knows
what
may
happen
next
chapter
xii
it
would
be
interesting
no
doubt
to
describe
the
feelings
of
lord
yalding
as
he
followed
mabel
and
jimmy
through
his
ancestral
halls
but
i
have
no
means
of
knowing
at
all
what
he
felt
yet
one
must
suppose
that
he
felt
something
bewilderment
perhaps
mixed
with
a
faint
wonder
and
a
desire
to
pinch
himself
to
see
if
he
were
dreaming
or
he
may
have
pondered
the
rival
questions
am
i
mad
are
they
mad
without
being
at
all
able
to
decide
which
he
ought
to
try
to
answer
let
alone
deciding
what
in
either
case
the
answer
ought
to
be
you
see
the
children
did
seem
to
believe
in
the
odd
stories
they
told
and
the
wish
come
true
and
the
ghost
appeared
he
must
have
thought
but
all
this
is
vain
i
do
know
what
he
thought
any
more
than
you
do
nor
can
i
give
you
any
clue
to
the
thoughts
and
feelings
of
mademoiselle
i
only
know
that
she
was
very
happy
but
any
one
would
have
known
that
if
they
had
seen
her
face
perhaps
this
is
as
good
a
moment
as
any
to
explain
that
when
her
guardian
had
put
her
in
a
convent
so
that
she
should
not
sacrifice
her
fortune
by
marrying
a
poor
lord
her
guardian
had
secured
that
fortune
to
himself
by
going
off
with
it
to
south
america
then
having
no
money
left
mademoiselle
had
to
work
for
it
so
she
went
out
as
governess
and
took
the
situation
she
did
take
because
it
was
near
lord
yalding
home
she
wanted
to
see
him
even
though
she
thought
he
had
forsaken
her
and
did
not
love
her
any
more
and
now
she
had
seen
him
i
daresay
she
thought
about
some
of
these
things
as
she
went
along
through
his
house
her
hand
held
in
his
but
of
course
i
ca
be
sure
jimmy
thoughts
of
course
i
can
read
like
any
old
book
he
thought
now
he
to
believe
me
that
lord
yalding
should
believe
him
had
become
quite
unreasonably
the
most
important
thing
in
the
world
to
jimmy
he
wished
that
gerald
and
kathleen
were
there
to
share
his
triumph
but
they
were
helping
mabel
aunt
to
cover
the
grand
furniture
up
and
so
were
out
of
what
followed
not
that
they
missed
much
for
when
mabel
proudly
said
now
you
see
and
the
others
came
close
round
her
in
the
little
panelled
room
there
was
a
pause
and
then
nothing
happened
at
all
there
a
secret
spring
here
somewhere
said
mabel
fumbling
with
fingers
that
had
suddenly
grown
hot
and
damp
where
said
lord
yalding
said
mabel
impatiently
only
i
ca
find
it
and
she
could
she
found
the
spring
of
the
secret
panel
under
the
window
all
right
but
that
seemed
to
every
one
dull
compared
with
the
jewels
that
every
one
had
pictured
and
two
at
least
had
seen
but
the
spring
that
made
the
oak
panelling
slide
away
and
displayed
jewels
plainly
to
any
eye
worth
a
king
ransom
this
could
not
be
found
more
it
was
simply
not
there
there
could
be
no
doubt
of
that
every
inch
of
the
panelling
was
felt
by
careful
fingers
the
earnest
protests
of
mabel
and
jimmy
died
away
presently
in
a
silence
made
painful
by
the
hotness
of
one
ears
the
discomfort
of
not
liking
to
meet
any
eyes
and
the
resentful
feeling
that
the
spring
was
not
behaving
in
at
all
a
sportsmanlike
way
and
that
in
a
word
this
was
not
cricket
you
see
said
lord
yalding
severely
now
you
had
your
joke
if
you
call
it
a
joke
and
i
had
enough
of
the
whole
silly
business
give
me
the
ring
it
mine
i
suppose
since
you
say
you
found
it
somewhere
here
and
do
let
hear
another
word
about
all
this
rubbish
of
magic
and
enchantment
gerald
got
the
ring
said
mabel
miserably
then
go
and
fetch
him
said
lord
yalding
both
of
you
the
melancholy
pair
retired
and
lord
yalding
spent
the
time
of
their
absence
in
explaining
to
mademoiselle
how
very
unimportant
jewels
were
compared
with
other
things
the
four
children
came
back
together
we
had
enough
of
this
ring
business
said
lord
yalding
give
it
to
me
and
we
say
no
more
about
it
i
i
ca
get
it
off
said
gerald
it
it
always
did
have
a
will
of
its
own
i
soon
get
it
off
said
lord
yalding
but
he
did
we
try
soap
he
said
firmly
four
out
of
his
five
hearers
knew
just
exactly
how
much
use
soap
would
be
they
wo
believe
about
the
jewels
wailed
mabel
suddenly
dissolved
in
tears
and
i
ca
find
the
spring
i
felt
all
over
we
all
have
it
was
just
here
and
her
fingers
felt
it
just
as
she
spoke
and
as
she
ceased
to
speak
the
carved
panels
slid
away
and
the
blue
velvet
shelves
laden
with
jewels
were
disclosed
to
the
unbelieving
eyes
of
lord
yalding
and
the
lady
who
was
to
be
his
wife
jove
said
lord
yalding
said
the
lady
but
why
gasped
mabel
why
not
before
i
expect
it
magic
said
gerald
there
no
real
spring
here
and
it
could
act
because
the
ring
was
here
you
know
phœbus
told
us
the
ring
was
the
heart
of
all
the
magic
shut
it
up
and
take
the
ring
away
and
see
they
did
and
gerald
was
as
usual
he
himself
pointed
out
proved
to
be
right
when
the
ring
was
away
there
was
no
spring
when
the
ring
was
in
the
room
there
as
mabel
urged
was
the
spring
all
right
enough
so
you
see
said
mabel
to
lord
yalding
i
see
that
the
spring
very
artfully
concealed
said
that
dense
peer
i
think
it
was
very
clever
indeed
of
you
to
find
it
and
if
those
jewels
are
real
of
course
they
real
said
mabel
indignantly
well
anyway
said
lord
yalding
thank
you
all
very
much
i
think
it
clearing
up
i
send
the
wagonette
home
with
you
after
lunch
and
if
you
do
mind
i
have
the
ring
half
an
hour
of
soap
and
water
produced
no
effect
whatever
except
to
make
the
finger
of
gerald
very
red
and
very
sore
then
lord
yalding
said
something
very
impatient
indeed
and
then
gerald
suddenly
became
angry
and
said
well
i
sure
i
wish
it
would
come
off
and
of
course
instantly
slick
as
butter
as
he
later
pointed
out
off
it
came
thank
you
said
lord
yalding
and
i
believe
now
he
thinks
i
kept
it
on
on
purpose
said
gerald
afterwards
when
at
ease
on
the
leads
at
home
they
talked
the
whole
thing
out
over
a
tin
of
preserved
pineapple
and
a
bottle
of
gingerbeer
apiece
there
no
pleasing
some
people
he
was
in
such
a
fiery
hurry
to
order
that
wagonette
after
he
found
that
mademoiselle
meant
to
go
when
we
did
but
i
liked
him
better
when
he
was
a
humble
bailiff
take
him
for
all
in
all
he
does
not
look
as
if
we
should
like
him
again
he
does
know
what
the
matter
with
him
said
kathleen
leaning
back
against
the
tiled
roof
it
really
the
magic
it
like
sickening
with
measles
do
you
remember
how
cross
mabel
was
at
first
about
the
invisibleness
rather
said
jimmy
it
partly
that
said
gerald
trying
to
be
fair
and
partly
it
the
being
in
love
it
always
makes
people
like
idiots
a
chap
at
school
told
me
his
sister
was
like
that
quite
rotten
you
know
and
she
used
to
be
quite
a
decent
sort
before
she
was
engaged
at
tea
and
at
supper
mademoiselle
was
radiant
as
attractive
as
a
lady
on
a
christmas
card
as
merry
as
a
marmoset
and
as
kind
as
you
would
always
be
yourself
if
you
could
take
the
trouble
at
breakfast
an
equal
radiance
kindness
attraction
merriment
then
lord
yalding
came
to
see
her
the
meeting
took
place
in
the
the
children
with
deep
discreetness
remained
shut
in
the
schoolroom
till
gerald
going
up
to
his
room
for
a
pencil
surprised
eliza
with
her
ear
glued
to
the
after
that
gerald
sat
on
the
top
stair
with
a
book
he
could
not
hear
any
of
the
conversation
in
the
but
he
could
command
a
view
of
the
door
and
in
this
way
be
certain
that
no
one
else
heard
any
of
it
thus
it
was
that
when
the
door
opened
gerald
was
in
a
position
to
see
lord
yalding
come
out
our
young
hero
as
he
said
later
coughed
with
infinite
tact
to
show
that
he
was
there
but
lord
yalding
did
not
seem
to
notice
he
walked
in
a
blind
sort
of
way
to
the
fumbled
clumsily
with
the
umbrellas
and
mackintoshes
found
his
straw
hat
and
looked
at
it
gloomily
crammed
it
on
his
head
and
went
out
banging
the
door
behind
him
in
the
most
reckless
way
he
left
the
door
open
and
gerald
though
he
had
purposely
put
himself
in
a
position
where
one
could
hear
nothing
from
the
when
the
door
was
shut
could
hear
something
quite
plainly
now
that
the
door
was
open
that
something
he
noticed
with
deep
distress
and
disgust
was
the
sound
of
sobs
and
sniffs
mademoiselle
was
quite
certainly
crying
jimminy
he
remarked
to
himself
they
have
lost
much
time
fancy
their
beginning
to
quarrel
i
hope
i
never
have
to
be
anybody
lover
but
this
was
no
time
to
brood
on
the
terrors
of
his
own
future
eliza
might
at
any
time
occur
she
would
not
for
a
moment
hesitate
to
go
through
that
open
door
and
push
herself
into
the
very
secret
sacred
heart
of
mademoiselle
grief
it
seemed
to
gerald
better
that
he
should
be
the
one
to
do
this
so
he
went
softly
down
the
worn
green
dutch
carpet
of
the
stairs
and
into
the
shutting
the
door
softly
and
securely
behind
him
it
is
all
over
mademoiselle
was
saying
her
face
buried
in
the
beady
on
a
red
ground
worked
for
a
cushion
cover
by
a
former
pupil
he
will
not
marry
me
do
not
ask
me
how
gerald
had
gained
the
lady
confidence
he
had
as
i
think
i
said
almost
at
the
beginning
very
pretty
ways
with
when
he
chose
anyway
he
was
holding
her
hand
almost
as
affectionately
as
if
she
had
been
his
mother
with
a
headache
and
saying
do
and
do
cry
and
it
be
all
right
you
see
if
it
is
in
the
most
comforting
way
you
can
imagine
varying
the
treatment
with
gentle
thumps
on
the
back
and
entreaties
to
her
to
tell
him
all
about
it
this
was
mere
curiosity
as
you
might
think
the
entreaties
were
prompted
by
gerald
growing
certainty
that
whatever
was
the
matter
was
somehow
the
fault
of
that
ring
and
in
this
gerald
was
once
more
as
he
told
himself
right
the
tale
as
told
by
mademoiselle
was
certainly
an
unusual
one
lord
yalding
last
night
after
dinner
had
walked
in
the
park
to
think
of
yes
i
know
said
gerald
and
he
had
the
ring
on
and
he
saw
he
saw
the
monuments
become
alive
sobbed
mademoiselle
his
brain
was
troubled
by
the
ridiculous
accounts
of
fairies
that
you
tell
him
he
sees
apollon
and
aphrodité
alive
on
their
marble
he
remembers
him
of
your
story
he
wish
himself
a
statue
then
he
becomes
mad
imagines
to
himself
that
your
story
of
the
island
is
true
plunges
in
the
lake
swims
among
the
beasts
of
the
ark
of
noé
feeds
with
gods
on
an
island
at
dawn
the
madness
become
less
he
think
the
panthéon
vanish
but
him
no
he
thinks
himself
statue
hiding
from
gardeners
in
his
garden
till
nine
less
a
quarter
then
he
thinks
to
wish
himself
no
more
a
statue
and
perceives
that
he
is
flesh
and
blood
a
bad
dream
but
he
has
lost
the
head
with
the
tales
you
tell
he
say
it
is
no
dream
but
he
is
fool
mad
how
you
say
and
a
mad
man
must
not
marry
there
is
no
hope
i
am
at
despair
and
the
life
is
vain
there
said
gerald
earnestly
i
assure
you
there
is
hope
i
mean
and
life
as
right
as
rain
really
and
there
nothing
to
despair
about
he
mad
and
it
a
dream
it
magic
it
really
and
truly
is
the
magic
exists
not
mademoiselle
moaned
it
is
that
he
is
mad
it
is
the
joy
to
me
after
so
many
days
oh
did
he
talk
to
the
gods
gerald
asked
gently
it
is
there
the
most
mad
of
all
his
ideas
he
say
that
mercure
give
him
rendezvous
at
some
temple
when
the
moon
raise
herself
right
cried
gerald
righto
dear
nice
kind
pretty
mademoiselle
rapunzel
do
be
a
silly
little
duffer
he
lost
himself
for
a
moment
among
the
consoling
endearments
he
was
accustomed
to
offer
to
kathleen
in
moments
of
grief
and
emotion
but
hastily
added
i
mean
do
not
be
a
lady
who
weeps
causelessly
he
will
go
to
that
temple
i
will
go
thou
shalt
go
he
will
go
we
will
go
you
will
go
let
all
go
and
you
see
it
going
to
be
absolutely
all
right
he
see
he
mad
and
you
understand
all
about
everything
take
my
handkerchief
its
quite
a
clean
one
as
it
happens
i
have
even
unfolded
it
oh
do
stop
crying
there
a
dear
darling
lover
this
flood
of
eloquence
was
not
without
effect
she
took
his
handkerchief
sobbed
half
smiled
dabbed
at
her
eyes
and
said
oh
naughty
is
it
some
trick
you
play
him
like
the
ghost
i
ca
explain
said
gerald
but
i
give
you
my
word
of
honour
you
know
what
an
englishman
word
of
honour
is
do
you
even
if
you
french
that
everything
is
going
to
be
exactly
what
you
wish
never
told
you
a
lie
believe
me
it
is
curious
said
she
drying
her
eyes
but
i
do
and
once
again
so
suddenly
that
he
could
not
have
resisted
she
kissed
him
i
think
however
that
in
this
her
hour
of
sorrow
he
would
have
thought
it
mean
to
resist
it
pleases
her
and
it
does
hurt
me
much
would
have
been
his
thought
and
now
it
is
near
moonrise
the
french
governess
half
hoping
but
wholly
longing
to
be
near
lord
yalding
even
if
he
be
as
mad
as
a
march
hare
and
the
four
children
they
have
collected
mabel
by
an
urgent
posted
the
day
before
are
going
over
the
dewy
grass
the
moon
has
not
yet
risen
but
her
light
is
in
the
sky
mixed
with
the
pink
and
purple
of
the
sunset
the
west
is
heavy
with
and
rich
colour
but
the
east
where
the
moon
rises
is
clear
as
a
they
go
across
the
lawn
and
through
the
and
come
at
last
through
a
tangle
of
underwood
and
bramble
to
a
little
level
tableland
that
rises
out
of
the
flat
one
tableland
out
of
another
here
is
the
ring
of
vast
rugged
stones
one
pierced
with
a
curious
round
hole
worn
smooth
at
its
edges
in
the
middle
of
the
circle
is
a
great
flat
stone
alone
desolate
full
of
meaning
a
stone
that
is
covered
thick
with
the
memory
of
old
faiths
and
creeds
long
since
forgotten
something
dark
moves
in
the
circle
the
french
girl
breaks
from
the
children
goes
to
it
clings
to
its
arm
it
is
lord
yalding
and
he
is
telling
her
to
go
never
of
the
life
she
cries
if
you
are
mad
i
am
mad
too
for
i
believe
the
tale
these
children
tell
and
i
am
here
to
be
with
thee
and
see
with
thee
whatever
the
rising
moon
shall
show
us
the
children
holding
hands
by
the
flat
stone
more
moved
by
the
magic
in
the
girl
voice
than
by
any
magic
of
enchanted
rings
listen
trying
not
to
listen
are
you
not
afraid
lord
yalding
is
saying
afraid
with
you
she
laughs
he
put
his
arm
round
her
the
children
hear
her
sigh
are
you
afraid
he
says
my
darling
gerald
goes
across
the
wide
turf
ring
expressly
to
say
you
ca
be
afraid
if
you
are
wearing
the
ring
and
i
sorry
but
we
can
hear
every
word
you
say
she
laughs
again
it
makes
nothing
she
says
you
know
already
if
we
love
each
other
then
he
puts
the
ring
on
her
finger
and
they
stand
together
the
white
of
his
flannel
coat
sleeve
marks
no
line
on
the
white
of
her
dress
they
stand
as
though
cut
out
of
one
block
of
marble
then
a
faint
greyness
touches
the
top
of
that
round
hole
creeps
up
the
side
then
the
hole
is
a
disc
of
light
a
moonbeam
strikes
straight
through
it
across
the
grey
green
of
the
circle
that
the
stones
mark
and
as
the
moon
rises
the
moonbeam
slants
downward
the
children
have
drawn
back
till
they
stand
close
to
the
lovers
the
moonbeam
slants
more
and
more
now
it
touches
the
far
end
of
the
stone
now
it
draws
nearer
and
nearer
to
the
middle
of
it
now
at
last
it
touches
the
very
heart
and
centre
of
that
central
stone
and
then
it
is
as
though
a
spring
were
touched
a
fountain
of
light
released
everything
changes
or
rather
everything
is
revealed
there
are
no
more
secrets
the
plan
of
the
world
seems
plain
like
an
easy
sum
that
one
writes
in
big
figures
on
a
child
slate
one
wonders
how
one
can
ever
have
wondered
about
anything
space
is
not
every
place
that
one
has
seen
or
dreamed
of
is
here
time
is
not
into
this
instant
is
crowded
all
that
one
has
ever
done
or
dreamed
of
doing
it
is
a
moment
and
it
is
eternity
it
is
the
centre
of
the
universe
and
it
is
the
universe
itself
the
eternal
light
rests
on
and
illuminates
the
eternal
heart
of
things
none
of
the
six
human
beings
who
saw
that
were
ever
able
to
think
about
it
as
having
anything
to
do
with
time
only
for
one
instant
could
that
moonray
have
rested
full
on
the
centre
of
that
stone
and
yet
there
was
time
for
many
happenings
from
that
height
one
could
see
far
out
over
the
quiet
park
and
sleeping
gardens
and
through
the
grey
green
of
them
shapes
moved
approaching
the
great
beasts
came
first
strange
forms
that
were
when
the
world
was
new
gigantic
lizards
with
wings
dragons
they
lived
as
in
memories
mammoths
strange
vast
birds
they
crawled
up
the
hill
and
ranged
themselves
outside
the
circle
then
not
from
the
garden
but
from
very
far
away
came
the
stone
gods
of
egypt
and
assyria
all
in
stone
and
all
alive
and
alert
strange
grotesque
figures
from
the
towers
of
cathedrals
figures
of
angels
with
folded
wings
figures
of
beasts
with
wings
wide
spread
sphinxes
uncouth
idols
from
southern
islands
and
last
of
all
the
beautiful
marble
shapes
of
the
gods
and
goddesses
who
had
held
their
festival
on
the
and
bidden
lord
yalding
and
the
children
to
this
meeting
not
a
word
was
spoken
each
stone
shape
came
gladly
and
quietly
into
the
circle
of
light
and
understanding
as
children
tired
with
a
long
ramble
creep
quietly
through
the
open
door
into
the
firelit
welcome
of
home
the
children
had
thought
to
ask
many
questions
and
it
had
been
promised
that
the
questions
should
be
answered
yet
now
no
one
spoke
a
word
because
all
had
come
into
the
circle
of
the
real
magic
where
all
things
are
understood
without
speech
afterwards
none
of
them
could
ever
remember
at
all
what
had
happened
but
they
never
forgot
that
they
had
been
somewhere
where
everything
was
easy
and
beautiful
and
people
who
can
remember
even
that
much
are
never
quite
the
same
again
and
when
they
came
to
talk
of
it
next
day
they
found
that
to
each
some
little
part
of
that
night
great
enlightenment
was
left
all
the
stone
creatures
drew
closer
round
the
stone
the
light
where
the
moonbeam
struck
it
seemed
to
break
away
in
spray
such
as
water
makes
when
it
falls
from
a
height
all
the
crowd
was
bathed
in
whiteness
a
deep
hush
lay
over
the
vast
assembly
then
a
wave
of
intention
swept
over
the
mighty
crowd
all
the
faces
bird
beast
greek
statue
babylonian
monster
human
child
and
human
lover
turned
upward
the
radiant
light
illumined
them
and
one
word
broke
from
all
the
light
they
cried
and
the
sound
of
their
voice
was
like
the
sound
of
a
great
wave
the
light
the
light
and
then
the
light
was
not
any
more
and
soft
as
floating
sleep
was
laid
on
the
eyes
of
all
but
the
immortals
the
grass
was
chill
and
dewy
and
the
clouds
had
veiled
the
moon
the
lovers
and
the
children
were
standing
together
all
clinging
close
not
for
fear
but
for
love
i
want
said
the
french
girl
softly
to
go
to
the
cave
on
the
island
very
quietly
through
the
gentle
brooding
night
they
went
down
to
the
loosed
the
clanking
chain
and
dipped
oars
among
the
drowned
stars
and
lilies
they
came
to
the
island
and
found
the
steps
i
brought
candles
said
gerald
in
case
so
lighted
by
gerald
candles
they
went
down
into
the
hall
of
psyche
and
there
glowed
the
light
spread
from
her
statue
and
all
was
as
the
children
had
seen
it
before
it
is
the
hall
of
granted
wishes
the
ring
said
lord
yalding
the
ring
said
his
lover
is
the
magic
ring
given
long
ago
to
a
mortal
and
it
is
what
you
say
it
is
it
was
given
to
your
ancestor
by
a
lady
of
my
house
that
he
might
build
her
a
garden
and
a
house
like
her
own
palace
and
garden
in
her
own
land
so
that
this
place
is
built
partly
by
his
love
and
partly
by
that
magic
she
never
lived
to
see
it
that
was
the
price
of
the
magic
it
must
have
been
english
that
she
spoke
for
otherwise
how
could
the
children
have
understood
her
yet
the
words
were
not
like
way
of
speaking
except
from
children
her
voice
went
on
the
ring
exacts
a
payment
you
paid
for
me
when
i
came
by
your
wish
by
this
terror
of
madness
that
you
have
since
known
only
one
wish
is
free
and
that
wish
is
the
last
she
said
shall
i
wish
yes
wish
they
said
all
of
them
i
wish
then
said
lord
yalding
lover
that
all
the
magic
this
ring
has
wrought
may
be
undone
and
that
the
ring
itself
may
be
no
more
and
no
less
than
a
charm
to
bind
thee
and
me
together
for
evermore
she
ceased
and
as
she
ceased
the
enchanted
light
died
away
the
windows
of
granted
wishes
went
out
like
pictures
gerald
candle
faintly
lighted
a
rudely
arched
cave
and
where
psyche
statue
had
been
was
a
stone
with
something
carved
on
it
gerald
held
the
light
low
it
is
her
grave
the
girl
said
next
day
no
one
could
remember
anything
at
all
exactly
but
a
good
many
things
were
changed
there
was
no
ring
but
the
plain
gold
ring
that
mademoiselle
found
clasped
in
her
hand
when
she
woke
in
her
own
bed
in
the
morning
more
than
half
the
jewels
in
the
panelled
room
were
gone
and
those
that
remained
had
no
panelling
to
cover
them
they
just
lay
bare
on
the
shelves
there
was
no
passage
at
the
back
of
the
temple
of
flora
quite
a
lot
of
the
secret
passages
and
hidden
rooms
had
disappeared
and
there
were
not
nearly
so
many
statues
in
the
garden
as
everyone
had
supposed
and
large
pieces
of
the
castle
were
missing
and
had
to
be
replaced
at
great
expense
from
which
we
may
conclude
that
lord
yalding
ancestor
had
used
the
ring
a
good
deal
to
help
him
in
his
building
however
the
jewels
that
were
left
were
quite
enough
to
pay
for
everything
the
suddenness
with
which
all
the
was
undone
was
such
a
shock
to
everyone
concerned
that
they
now
almost
doubt
that
any
magic
ever
happened
but
it
is
certain
that
lord
yalding
married
the
french
governess
and
that
a
plain
gold
ring
was
used
in
the
ceremony
and
this
if
you
come
to
think
of
it
could
be
no
other
than
the
magic
ring
turned
by
that
last
wish
into
a
charm
to
keep
him
and
his
wife
together
for
ever
also
if
all
this
story
is
nonsense
and
a
if
gerald
and
jimmy
and
kathleen
and
mabel
have
merely
imposed
on
my
trusting
nature
by
a
pack
of
unlikely
inventions
how
do
you
account
for
the
paragraph
which
appeared
in
the
evening
papers
the
day
after
the
magic
of
the
mysterious
disappearance
of
a
city
man
it
said
and
then
went
on
to
say
how
a
gentleman
well
known
and
much
respected
in
financial
circles
had
vanished
leaving
no
trace
ugli
the
papers
continued
had
remained
late
working
at
his
office
as
was
his
occasional
habit
the
office
door
was
found
locked
and
on
its
being
broken
open
the
clothes
of
the
unfortunate
gentleman
were
found
in
a
heap
on
the
floor
together
with
an
umbrella
a
walking
stick
a
golf
club
and
curiously
enough
a
feather
brush
such
as
housemaids
use
for
dusting
of
his
body
however
there
was
no
trace
the
police
are
stated
to
have
a
clue
if
they
have
they
have
kept
it
to
themselves
but
i
do
not
think
they
can
have
a
clue
because
of
course
that
respected
gentleman
was
the
who
became
real
when
in
search
of
a
really
good
hotel
he
got
into
the
hall
of
granted
wishes
and
if
none
of
this
story
ever
happened
how
is
it
that
those
four
children
are
such
friends
with
lord
and
lady
yalding
and
stay
at
the
towers
almost
every
holidays
it
is
all
very
well
for
all
of
them
to
pretend
that
the
whole
of
this
story
is
my
own
