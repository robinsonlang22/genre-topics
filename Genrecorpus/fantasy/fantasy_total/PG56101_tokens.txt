sweet
rocket
i
the
woman
driving
turned
the
phaeton
from
the
highway
into
a
narrow
road
almost
immediately
the
forest
through
which
they
had
been
passing
for
a
mile
or
more
deepened
it
was
now
a
rich
woodland
little
cut
seldom
touched
by
fire
apparently
the
road
knew
little
use
narrow
and
in
part
soft
from
yesterday
rain
dimmed
by
many
trees
now
it
bent
and
now
it
ran
straight
a
dun
streak
cut
always
in
front
by
that
ancient
exquisite
screen
of
bough
and
leaf
the
highway
dropped
out
of
sight
and
mind
the
woman
to
whom
this
countryside
was
new
sitting
beside
the
woman
driving
drew
a
breath
of
pleasure
oh
smell
it
it
goes
over
you
like
balm
it
washes
the
travel
stains
away
take
off
your
hat
the
other
obeyed
turning
and
placing
it
upon
the
back
seat
beside
a
large
and
a
small
traveling
bag
she
drew
off
her
gloves
too
then
straightening
herself
sighed
again
with
happiness
how
deep
it
goes
and
quiet
it
thousands
of
miles
away
hundreds
of
thousands
and
right
at
hand
leaves
were
beginning
to
turn
maples
had
lighted
fires
hickories
were
making
gold
dogwood
and
sumac
dyeing
with
crimson
ironweed
yet
blooming
blotched
the
roadside
with
purple
lifted
heads
of
ashy
pink
goldenrod
started
forth
in
places
made
a
low
mist
of
lilac
the
road
dipped
into
a
dell
the
gray
horse
the
phaeton
crossed
a
brown
streamlet
sliding
murmuring
mint
filled
the
air
the
road
lifted
and
ran
on
again
into
mystery
blackbirds
flew
across
a
woodpecker
tapped
and
tapped
a
squirrel
ran
up
an
oak
but
for
all
of
faint
stealthy
rustle
perpetual
low
sound
and
small
movements
without
end
deep
deep
deep
rest
was
the
note
rest
and
solitude
the
old
strong
gray
horse
was
named
daniel
this
was
his
road
since
he
was
a
colt
sometimes
he
might
find
upon
it
whitefoot
and
bess
the
farm
horses
drawing
the
farm
wagon
but
oftenest
it
was
solitary
like
this
his
road
sweet
rocket
road
the
phaeton
moving
its
wheels
rolled
it
droned
it
forth
sweet
rocket
road
sweet
rocket
road
there
are
five
miles
of
it
said
marget
her
tone
added
i
love
it
its
solitariness
its
ownness
it
miraculously
beautiful
answered
her
companion
it
aches
it
is
so
beautiful
sweet
rocket
road
sweet
rocket
road
said
the
wheels
way
to
sweet
rocket
way
to
sweet
rocket
it
is
straight
and
as
an
arrow
no
one
goes
but
one
who
wishes
to
travel
to
sweet
rocket
it
is
our
road
in
and
our
road
out
there
seems
to
be
no
other
i
mean
that
it
is
the
only
road
made
with
spade
and
pick
they
traveled
again
in
silence
the
visitor
sat
a
small
elderly
woman
with
a
thin
strong
intelligent
face
something
about
her
alike
of
strength
and
of
limitation
said
teacher
for
long
years
she
sat
with
her
hands
in
her
lap
looking
at
that
truly
beautiful
road
and
the
forest
walls
but
at
last
with
a
sigh
of
appreciation
she
turned
to
talk
twenty
years
and
more
since
we
last
met
but
you
keep
young
marget
i
had
no
difficulty
in
picking
you
out
of
the
station
crowd
nor
i
you
dear
miss
darcy
but
then
i
always
kept
you
in
mind
and
heart
i
owe
you
so
much
ah
marget
not
much
i
owe
you
learning
it
is
a
good
deal
to
take
a
country
girl
charge
scarcely
anything
for
her
and
see
that
she
gets
knowledge
and
learns
how
to
get
more
and
more
you
are
of
those
who
reward
teaching
do
let
us
talk
about
that
which
was
neither
load
nor
task
and
so
is
no
debt
the
interests
me
you
look
well
your
face
is
a
rose
under
clear
brown
i
am
well
and
happy

happy
i
know
that
you
could
be
happy
unless
you
were
helping
i
do
know
how
much
i
help
i
help
some
you
were
never
given
to
long
letters
there
really
is
much
that
i
at
all
know
about
you
and
such
as
they
are
i
have
had
very
few
letters
of
late
years
it
was
the
sheerest
accident
my
finding
out
that
this
was
your
part
of
the
country
i
might
have
gone
to
the
conference
and
never
known
that
you
were
not
twenty
miles
away
the
day
before
i
had
your
card
i
knew
that
something
pleasant
was
going
to
happen
well
tell
me
what
you
do
marget
land
looked
over
daniel
ears
down
the
vista
of
the
road
at
this
point
hemlocks
grew
to
either
hand
cones
of
a
green
that
was
almost
black
between
rose
sycamores
with
pale
arms
and
leaves
like
silky
brown
hair
at
the
road
edge
the
made
a
lacework
and
above
it
glowed
the
sumac
torches
blue
sky
roofed
the
autumn
earth
the
air
just
flowed
neither
hot
nor
cold
milk
warm
happy
summer
and

drawn
up
into
a
gracious
figure
autumn
a
goddess
she
drew
a
light
sighing
breath
i
told
you
that
i
was
happy
it
strange
living
is
it
strange
and
sweet
the
way
things
come
about
there
magic
all
right
sweet
rocket
i
was
born
in
the
overseer
house
at
sweet
rocket
that
was
ten
years
after
the
war
and
there
was
much
nor
many
for
my
father
to
oversee
i
love
my
father
he
was
what
the
mountain
folk
call
he
had
ability
and
a
lot
of
goodness
and
a
lot
of
kindness
education
from
books
had
not
come
his
way
but
he
knew
many
things
he
had
worked
hard
and
saved
and
after
the
war
when
he
gave
up
overseeing
or
it
gave
him
up
and
when
he
turned
merchant
in
alder
over
there
he
made
money
as
we
looked
at
it
in
virginia
in
those
days
some
money
that
is
he
had
ten
thousand
dollars
in
bank
when
old
major
linden
died
and
mary
linden
married
and
went
away
and
sweet
rocket
was
sold
for
debt
he
bought
it
though
he
kept
a
steady
face
he
was
so
proud
to
buy
it
i
was
nine
years
old
when
we
moved
out
of
the
overseer
house
into
the
big
house
my
mother
my
father
my
two
brothers
and
i
loved
it
loved
it
loved
it
love
it
love
it
love
it
i
remember
the
very
way
in
which
you
used
to
say
it
rocket
we
became
at
once
land
poor
and
my
father
had
an
illness
and
though
he
seemed
to
recover
never
did
quite
recover
when
it
came
to
choosing
and
bargaining
making
and
laying
by
he
was
never
again
the
man
he
had
been
my
mother
too
who
had
worked
so
hard
when
she
was
young
too
hard
began
to
fail
will
my
elder
brother
went
west
edgar
the
younger
wanted
to
go
too
he
did
not
like
it
here
you
see
every
one
still
said
old
overseer
bought
it
they
were
all
born
in
the
overseer
house
now
they
rattle
around
in
the
lindens
house
bottom
rail
it
was
still
called
linden
place
as
i
grew
old
enough
to
have
cared
for
what
they
said
i
somehow
escaped
caring
but
edgar
cared
it
was
hard
on
the
boy
but
i
loved
sweet
rocket
loved
it
love
it
i
love
the
overseer
house
and
the
big
house
which
is
of
course
very
big
for
the
place
was
always
a
simple
one
simple
and
still
and
out
of
the
way
she
seemed
to
pause
somewhat
deeply
to
vision
something
within
miss
darcy
watched
the
moving
walls
now
standing
close
now
a
little
receding
now
opening
as
it
were
into
gateways
through
which
were
seen
forest
lawns
and
aisles
they
shut
in
again
a
golden
bough
brushed
the
phaeton
she
who
had
been
speaking
put
out
her
hand
and
touched
it
how
could
one
help
but
love
it
to
me
it
is
forever
so
old
and
forever
so
new
i
lock
with
it
what
was
i
saying
well
edgar
did
not
like
it
and
my
mother
failed
and
father
had
less
money
and
less
money
and
still
we
went
on
five
years
eight
years
ten
years
then
in
one
year
my
father
died
and
my
mother
died
will
came
home
he
and
edgar
said
that
we
must
sell
sweet
rocket
i
was
eighteen
we
knew
about
the
mortgage
but
we
did
know
about
some
other
debts
when
it
was
sold
there
was
hardly
anything
to
divide
among
us
the
lindens
did
buy
it
back
then
no
not
then
northern
people
bought
it
will
went
back
to
wyoming
and
edgar
with
him
i
went
to
my
mother
sister
aunt
hester
who
lived
in
richmond
i
went
to
her
with
my
two
hundred
and
fifty
dollars
a
year
she
one
of
the
best
of
women
i
never
had
anything
but
kindness
from
her
and
one
of
the
greatest
was
when
she
spoke
of
me
to
you
she
put
her
hand
over
miss
darcy
hand
i
had
been
to
school
a
little
of
course
there
were
some
books
at
home
and
i
had
borrowed

i
could
but
in
richmond
to
you
i
really
began
to
go
to
school
you
studied
as
very
few
study
marget
you
studied
as
though
waves
of
things
were
coming
happily
back
into
memory
yes
but
you
released
something
always
fire
is
lit
from
fire
always
one
comes
to
any
that
sit
in
darkness
well
i
went
to
school
for
three
years
then
off

began
to

my
living
you
were
with

then
i
passed
into
library
work
i
went
to
washington
i
was
in
the
library
there
for
five
years
i
saved
i
wrote
a
few
papers
that
were
published
i
took
what
they
brought

i
left

and
so
i
paid
as
i
went
i
came
back
in
four
years
back
to
richmond
and
aunt
hester
until
i
might
look
about
me
and
see
what
i
could
do
for
i
must
earn
if
you
had
written
to
me
then
in
new
york
i
felt
that
but
there
is
something
do
you
know
there
is
something
that
guides
us
i
lay
one
night
thinking
of
sweet
rocket
i
could
always
come
back
here
just
as
really
come
back
from
the
ends
of
the
earth
i
came
back
often
there
has
always
been
along
the
garden
wall
sweet
rocket
dame
violet
you
know
some
of
it
is
white
and
some
is
purple
shining
clusters
growing
above
your
waist
i
could
gather
them
in
my
arms
and
feel
them
against
my
cheek
i
could
get
the
dark
cedars
that
come
up
from
the
river
i
lay
in
richmond
more
than
half
feeling
more
than
half
seeing
there
a
country
you
know
out
of
which
things
come
down
to
you
it
came
down
knowledge
i
meant
to
go
back
to
sweet
rocket
she
paused
look
at
that
tree
it
is
so
splendid
a
sugar
maple
is
it
and
that
one
mountain
linden
it
puts
on
a
clear
pale
gold
like
the
old
haloes
i
hear
water
it
is
the
little
stream
that
we
cross
see
how
sweet
and
clear
and
sounding
it
goes
hemlock
run
all
right
daniel
daniel
bent
mouth
to
water
and
drank
no
check
rein
no
gray
horse
and
old
phaeton
moved
again
the
wood
grew
richer
and
deeper
we
are
nearing
the
river
and
then
in
richmond
you
heard
about
sweet
rocket
aunt
hester
had
a
letter
from
alder
richard
linden
old
major
nephew
had
bought
sweet
rocket
i
was
glad
that
some
one
who
must
love
it
was
there
aunt
hester
said
that
he
had
visited
it
once
or
twice
as
a
young
boy
he
would
remember
it
then
as
i
remembered
it
the
second
letter
said
that
he
was
almost
blind
and
alone
on
the
place
save
for
the
colored
people
then
i
saw
his
advertisement
in
the
richmond
papers
he
wanted
a
secretary
one
who
could
read
aloud
well
so
i
answered
and
was
taken
five
years
ago
how
old
a
man
is
he
he
is
and
i
am
you
have
inner
youth
higher
youth
yes
childhood
there
so
has
he
do
you
love
him
marget
love
him
yes
but
not
the
way
if
that
is
what
you
mean
as
he
loves
me
but
not
the
way
so
we
shall
not
marry
in
the
way
but
we
live
here
together
all
the
same
well
if
it
is
as
fair
as
this
road
it
is
just
a
simple
house
in
the
bent
arm
of
a
little
river
and
with
hills
all
around
and
behind
the
hills
mountains
there
are
fields
and
an
orchard
and
garden
it
is
hidden
like
a
lost
place
and
happy
like
a
place
for
evermore
finding
itself
tell
me
about
mr
linden
no
let
us
wait
for
that
or
i
can
tell
outward
things
how
we
live
yes
he
has
only
a
small
fixed
income
it
would
at
all
go
round
the
year
so
we
farm
we
have
an
excellent
man
roger
carter
who
lives
in
the
overseer
house
wheat
corn
buckwheat
hay
and
apples
so
we
live
and
can
buy
though
with
an
elegant
spareness
books
and
victor
records
and
more
and
more
flowers
for
the
flower
garden
of
course
you
have
help
about
the
house
there
are
two
colored
men
and
a
boy
and
mimy
the
cook
and
zinia
the
housemaid
but
with
the
home
garden
and
cornfield
and
orchard
and
the
two
cows
and
the
chickens
and
ducks
and
daniel
and
whitefoot
and
bess
there
is
more
than
enough
to
do
you
will
be
surprised
to
see
how
much
he
does
himself
how
can
he
see
he
can
tell
light
from
darkness
and
the
dim
mass
of
things
and
then
when
you
are
blind
you
grow
so
skillful
with
the
other
senses
and
of
course
in
a
measure
all
of
us
are
eyes
to
him
he
has
a
great
strong
body
he
hoes
and
digs
he
knows
always
what
is
beneath
his
fingers
he
can
weed
a
garden
as
well
as
i
can
he
gathers
fruit
and
berries
and
vegetables
and
knows
the
perfect
from
the
imperfect
he
does
no
end
of
things
perhaps
he
may
work
with
his
hands
four
hours
a
day
and
then
there
are
letters
i
write
them
and
i
keep
his
accounts
and
of
course
the
house
then
we
read
it
is
a
sandwiched
business
but
we
must
average
three
hours
a
day
with
books
he
gets
up
very
early
and
walks
before
breakfast
and
usually
again
in
the
afternoon
sometimes
i
drive
him
on
this
road
sometimes
i
walk
with
him
sometimes
he
goes
alone
after
supper
we
read
or
listen
to
the
victor
singing
and
playing
or
we
talk
or
sit
by
the
fire
still
and
thinking
or
on
the
porch
steps
when
weather
is
warm
where
i
can
see
and
he
can
image
the
stars
i
see
a
good
life
we
are
not
without
neighbors
though
it
seems
so
lonely
and
then
folk
come
to
us
his
blindness
was
an
accident
you
know
he
has
had
life
in
the
world
as
i
have
had
life
in
the
world
we
life
in
the
world
he
is
one
then
that
may
be
loved
he
is
a
great
poet
though
he
would
never
call
himself
so
he
just
feels
and
acts
so
i
think
his
face
is
beautiful
i
think
that
your
face
is
beautiful
thought
miss
darcy
the
tawny
road
turned
a
little
east
trees
yet
green
trees
that
wore
the
one
color
the
year
round
blended
with
golden
trees
and
scarlet
trees
wild
grapes
with
twisted
and
shaggy
stems
and
yellowing
leaves
with
blue
grapes
hanging
over
ran
and
mounted
held
by
the
forest
arms
up
to
the
sun
sumac
that
was
somehow
like
the
indian
that
seemed
to
hold
memories
of
the
indian
in
the
land
grew
in
each
minute
clearing
there
arose
a
little
rustling
wind
the
ineffable
blue
air
moving
lightly
brown
butterflies
abounded
the
sense
grew
strong
of
remoteness
of
calm
that
was
not
indolence
of
beauty
gathered
and
at
home
miss
darcy
moved
a
little
marget
land
turned
toward
her
you
feel
it
do
you
yes
they
that
come
feel
it
they
are
drawn
there
are
centers
of
integration
this
is
one
i
do
not
know
who
started
it
probably
many
working
in
at
different
times
but
now
it
is
in
action
is
that
mysticism
no
it
is
fact
the
forest
stopped
with
clean
decision
the
road
ran
through
fields
where
the
corn
had
been
cut
and
shocked
the
shocks
stood
in
rows
like
brown
wigwams
daniel
and
the
phaeton
came
down
to
a
little
river
very
clear
falling
and
murmuring
over
stones
above
and
below
a
ford
but
at
the
ford
a
mirror
reflecting
autumn
hills
and
heaven
across
the
ford
stretched
a
little
pebbly
beach
crowned
with
trees
and
grass
and
behind
the
trees
stood
a
brick
house
not
so
large
as
large
houses
go
but
of
excellent
line
it
had
a
porch
with
doric
pillars
it
stood
among
fine
trees
in
a
small
valley
shut
in
on
all
sides
by
hills
and
mountains
all
forested
to
the
top
only
the
road
and
the
river
seemed
to
have
way
out
and
in
only
road
and
river
and
air
and
birds
valley
and
colored
mountain
walls
were
proportioned
modeled
tinted
to
some
wide
and
deep
artist
taste
the
tone
was
rest
without
weakness
movement
without
fury
solitude
that
had
all
company
how
could
you
help
but
love
it
said
the
visiting
woman
i
do
try
to
help
it
if
it
burned
down
if
the
hills
sank
and
the
wood
was
destroyed
still
it
would
endure
and
still
i
could
come
here
now
we
cross
the
river
look
at
the
bright
stones
and
the
minnows
gliding
darting
up
from
the
river
across
the
pebbly
shore
rose
cedars
dark
and
tall
they
are
like
warders
only
there
nothing
really
to
ward
out
all
things
may
meet
here
we
go
this
way
to
the
back
of
the
house
it
feels
enchanted
it
is
so
simple
you
might
call
it
meek
there
are
people
who
pass
who
say
lonely
they
were
now
at
the
back
of
the
house
where
the
road
skirted
the
flower
garden
here
was
the
back
door
with
three
rounded
steps
of
stone
daniel
and
the
phaeton
stood
still
the
two
women
left
the
vehicle
a
colored
man
appeared
miss
darcy
this
is
mancy
mancy
this
is
miss
darcy
come
to
stay
with
us
as
long
as
she
will
mancy
tall
and
spare
with
an
indian
said
that
he
was
glad
to
see
her
and
took
her
bags
in
the
brick
kitchen
in
the
yard
mimy
was
singing
swing
low
sweet
chariot
coming
for
to
carry
me
home
ii
i
might
stay
a
week
anna
darcy
spoke
to
herself
standing
at
the
window
of
the
room
where
marget
had
left
her
she
looked
down
upon
flowers
and
out
to
the
southern
wall
that
closed
in
the
valley
the
mountains
had
the
tints
of
desert
sands
at
sunset
they
had
long
wave
forms
they
were
not
peaked
nor
very
high
they
were
so
old
she
knew
appalachians
older
than
apennine
or
himalaya
they
were
wearing
down
here
disintegrating
the
weather
would
be
lowering
them
year
by
year
they
were
removing
and
building
elsewhere
they
had
granaries
full
of
memories
and
they
must
have
somewhere
springing
like
the
winter
wheat
as
many
as
the
blades
of
wheat
anticipations
down
in
the
garden
she
saw
marigolds
and
zinnias
late
blooming
pansies
mignonette
snapdragon
and
aster
and
heliotrope
larkspur
mourning
bride
and
citronalis
a
rosy
light
bathed
garden
and
fields
this
was
the
back
of
the
house
she
saw
two
or
three
cabins
and
a
barn
stacked
hay
and
a
rail
fence
worn
and
lichened
fostering
a
growth
of
trumpet
vine
and
traveler
joy
she
heard
cow
bells
a
boy
with
a
ebony
face
crossed
the
path
below
carrying
two
milk
pails
chickens
turkeys
and
guineas
walked
about
in
the
barnyard
from
the
kitchen
fifty
feet
from
the
house
floated
a
smell
of
coffee
and
of
bread
in
the
oven
all
the
place
was
clean
friendly
she
turned
to
the
large
room
the
walls
had
a
paper
of
on
which
hung
three
prints
the
bed
was
a
with
a
linen
valance
books
stood
ranged
above
an
ancient
desk
a
blue
jug
held
asters
there
was
a
large
closet
and
modern
blessing
a
bathroom
white
tubbed
pleasant
and
light
it
had
been
she
saw
an
old
dressing
room
between
the
two
chambers
upon
this
side
of
the
hall
with
a
door
for
each
both
doors
being
ajar
she
saw
room
large
like
this
one
furnished
not
unlike
this
one
but
that
something
told
her
was
really
the
spare
room
and
this
that
she
was
to
dwell
in
was
marget
room
it
had
the
feel
of
marget
it
is
the
pleasantest
and
so
she
has
given
it
to
me
she
bathed
and
changed
her
dress
all
the
time
old
happy
rhythms
ran
in
her
head
dressed
she
sat
down
by
one
of
the
western
windows
in
the
yet
warm
light
she
rested
her
head
against
the
back
of
the
chair
her
eyes
closed
she
was
no
longer
a
young
woman
and
she
had
had
a
tiring
year
and
it
was
grateful
to
her
to
rest
thus
rest
it
was
the
word
it
was
the
feeling
that
was
dwelling
in
this
place
rest
rest
deep
rest
without
idleness
the
air
was
so
rare
and
fine
mountain
air
she
remembered
that
they
said
that
the
valley
itself
lay
high
mountain
air
but
even
while
she
thought
that
she
had
a
sudden
sense
of
sea
air
fine
and
strong
and
drenched
with
sun
there
would
be
five
or
six
rooms
on
this
floor
all
were
large
and
the
hall
between
was
large
the
stairway
was
very
good
the
woodwork
everywhere
good
the
ceilings
were
high
they
used
lamps
and
candles
the
day
had
been
warm
fire
was
not
needed
but
wood
was
laid
in
the
fireplace
and
the
wood
box
beside
it
held
chestnut
and
pine
this
window
gave
upon
the
west
here
were
grass
and
the
red
and
gold
trees
and
the
pebbly
beach
and
the
sickle
of
the
water
and
the
fields
and
the
wood
through
which
they
had
driven
and
the
amethyst
mountains
the
sun
had
set
but
the
sky
stayed
aglow
the
fatigue
went
out
of
the
old
teacher
face
thy
bread
upon
the
waters
and
after
many
days
it
shall
return
to
thee
she
did
not
consciously
repeat
this
but
the
saying
overhung
her
she
had
slightly
opened
the
door
giving
upon
the
hall
so
that
marget
returning
might
know
that
she
was
ready
stair
and
hall
floor
were
bare
wood
a
step
sounded
upon
the
one
and
then
upon
the
other
she
was
sensitive
to
the
way
folk
trod
that
is
mr
linden
he
passed
her
door
and
she
heard
him
enter
his
room
across
the
hall
marget
presently
came
for
her
let
us
go
into
the
garden
until
the
bell
rings
the
garden
lay
spread
in
breadths
of
violet
brocade
they
walked
on
brick
paths
and
smelled
box
and
mignonette
then
zinia
rang
the
supper
bell
the
two
entered
the
lower
hall
yet
drenched
with
the
afterglow
a
man
tall
and
big
framed
turned
at
their
step
miss
darcy
this
is
mr
linden
he
put
out
his
hand
the
visitor
laid
hers
in
it
it
was
a
strong
hand
likable
his
voice
when
he
spoke
was
the
voice
for
the
hand
i
am
glad
to
see
you
miss
darcy
marget
and
i
are
glad
there
was
light
enough
to
show
a
face
the
eyes
were
they
were
not
disfigured
she
also
came
to
think
his
face
a
beautiful
one
they
went
into
the
dining
room
where
two
lamps
were
lighted
the
mahogany
table
had
a
blue
bowl
of
larkspur
zinia
in
a
blue
cotton
dress
and
white
apron
waited
there
were
coffee
delicate
rolls
a
perfection
of
butter
and
of
cream
a
salad
coddled
apples
and
sugar
cakes
marget
sat
behind
the
coffee
urn
and
cups
and
saucers
richard
linden
did
not
take
the
foot
of
the
table
but
sat
beside
her
at
the
right
she
aided
him
quietly
perfectly
nor
did
he
need
as
much
aid
as
might
be
thought
he
was
so
skillful
eyes
must
be
in
fingers
zinia
too
marked
his
needs
forestalled
things
she
called
him
dick
she
had
for
him
a
low
rich
confidential
whisper
the
salt
mr
dick
cottage
cheese
mr
dick
marget
called
him
richard
the
three
talked
of
the
ring
of
this
valley
and
of
the
ring
without
and
around
it
of
miss
darcy
doings
and
of
sweet
rocket
and
of
everybody
it
seemed
that
papers
magazines
the
news
must
come
here
earth
was
the
earth
of
the
beginning
of
the
third
decade
of
the
twentieth
century
there
was
news
enough
supper
over
they
went
into
the
parlor
that
was
opposite
the
dining
room
and
was
no
more
parlor
than
library
it
stretched
around
a
big
room
with
old
pictures
old
furniture
with
books
a
fire
flamed
and
sang
they
sat
in
the
firelight
richard
linden
on
one
side
of
the
hearth
and
marget
on
the
other
and
miss
darcy
beside
the
latter
still
there
was
talk
the
visitor
would
have
gathered
where
they
stood
on
questions
of
the
day
then
suddenly
saw
that
they
stood
all
round
and
through
and
that
the
day
to
them
was
so
old
and
young
that
it
included
yesterday
and
that
being
so
their
solutions
were
not
always
those
currently
offered
she
also
found
that
though
they
talked
they
were
not
talkative
with
them
conversation
became
a
rhythmic
thing
tranquil
pause
deep
retirement
then
again
the
word
and
it
startled
her
almost
how
completely
they
were
one
when
they
had
sat
by
the
fire
an
hour
marget
rising
put
violin
music
upon
a
victrola
hafitz
played
to
them
a
hebrew
melody
kreisler
played
and
maud
powell
the
flames
danced
the
world
heightened
then
one
after
the
other
came
three
songs
and
between
each
as
between
the
violin
pieces
they
watched
the
fire
and
the
forest
and
the
night
wind
were
felt
around
oh
that
we
two
were
maying
the
song
ended
the
fire
burned
they
heard
the
river
the
forest
was
all
around
a
man
voice
was
lifted
oh
that
i
knew
where
i
might
find
him
that
i
might
come
into
his
presence
again
the
wide
and
deep
pause
and
then
the
third
song
and
the
world
shall
go
up
with
a
shout
unto
god
marget
shut
the
victrola
again
they
sat
in
that
quiet
it
was
systole
and
diastole
it
was
in
and
out
and
inexpressibly
it
rested
and
that
was
what
she
wanted
rest
marget
lighted
a
lamp
that
stood
upon
the
table
linden
said
you
rather
not
read
no
we
wo
read
long
he
turned
to
the
visitor
do
you
mind
listening
miss
darcy
was
glad
to
listen
marget
began
to
read
her
old
teacher
remembered
that
she
had
read
well
twenty
years
ago
she
read
better
now
the
book
was
lafcadio
hearn
we
travel
so
said
linden
we
take
a
right
journeyer
and
journey
with
him
the
fire
flickered
then
seemed
to
pass
into
actual
fire
of
sun
they
were
in
martinique
under
pelée
in
saint
pierre
in
grand
anse
again
she
was
startled
to
feel
how
real
it
was
she
touched
she
knew
the
people
of
martinique
later
when
the
book
had
been
closed
when
they
had
said
good
night
one
to
the
other
when
she
lay
in
bed
in
the
dark
quiet
she
experienced
strongly
what
a
certain
number
of
times
in
her
life
she
had
been
able
to
experience
faintly
she
experienced
coherence
that
was
wider
than
old
coherences
she
interlocked
with
this
place
and
her
hosts
she
held
them
they
held
her
at
the
end
of
the
week
she
must
go
afar
but
never
any
more
so
far
that
i
lose
the
tune
never
any
more
she
went
to
sleep
with
a
strange
fair
feeling
of
sea
about
her
not
that
the
forest
the
hills
and
mountains
were
not
there
but
she
felt
the
sea
likewise
of
course
it
is
there
but
i
never
thought
to
look
at
it
or
taste
it
the
sea
and
mountains
and
they
and
me
threaded
together
talking
together
she
slept
iii
as
she
dressed
the
next
morning
she
heard
mimy
singing
but
no
stir
of
her
hosts
the
sun
was
shining
in
at
window
streamed
air
her
mind
was
upon
the
evening
before
and
its
current
of
happenings
as
she
had
gone
to
sleep
with
the
sea
of
which
they
had
read
about
her
so
now
the
three
songs
to
which
they
had
listened
returned
to
mind
returned
almost
to
sense
that
was
one
remarkable
thing
about
this
place
the
great
vividness
and
depth
of
perception
she
knew
the
difference
between
usual
or
even
intent
thinking
and
intuition
her
intuitions
had
not
been
vigorous
she
had
looked
at
them
with
a
kind
of
gray
wonder
as
at
pale
children
from
afar
they
came
at
long
intervals
but
were
never
forgotten
it
now
seemed
that
this
was
a
good
clime
for
them
she
stood
still
in
the
middle
of
her
room
her
mind
opened
that
we
two
were
maying
that
is
man
and
woman
love
time
out
of
mind
love
and
cry
of
love
it
is
romeo
and
juliet
it
is
tristan
and
isolde
that
i
knew
where
i
might
find
him
that
i
might
come
into
his
presence
that
is
religious
love
that
goes
up
from
man
and
woman
love
that
is
the
onward
going
the
seeking
of
great
lovers
the
world
shall
go
up
with
a
shout
unto
god
that
is
when
we
move
and
feel
and
think
not
as
men
and
women
but
as
humanity
the
great
mating
the
little
firmament
closed
like
eyelids
and
hid
the
greater
she
was
a
small
gray
woman
and
she
had
beaten
about
in
the
intellect
and
when
gleams
came
like
this
she
had
taken
them
and
promptly
when
the
sky
closed
had
doubted
if
they
had
ever
existed
but
she
was
less
inclined
to
doubt
there
remained
a
faint
luminousness
in
mind
a
sense
of
depth
behind
feeling
she
thought
if
i
could
stay
in
that
garden
i
should
indeed
know
bloom
and
music
she
moved
about
the
room
the
point
is
that
there
such
a
garden
she
finished
dressing
and
went
downstairs
zinia
met
her
in
the
hall
good
mahning
i
hope
you
slept
well
miss
marget
says
you
to
have
breakfast
on
the
porch
it
so
warm
and
beautiful
this
mahning
she
has
had
hers
yes
she
said
tell
you
sweet
rocket
was
home
i
put
the
table
here
but
if
it
too
sunny
i
can
move
it
it
not
too
sunny
i
like
sun
said
miss
darcy
i
like
it
too
said
zinia
and
departed
kitchenward
anna
darcy
sat
and
slowly
ate
catawba
grapes
the
porch
was
wide
the
table
placed
between
high
mellowed
pillars
beyond
them
the
autumn
turf
ran
to
great
trees
colored
like
venetian
glass
the
river
crescent
sparkled
in
light
beyond
it
she
saw
the
fields
and
the
woods
through
which
they
had
driven
all
was
closed
by
the
mountain
wall
very
soft
and
gracious
in
the
sun
in
the
still
warm
air
zinia
brought
coffee
and
rolls
there
was
honey
upon
the
table
and
an
old
blue
filled
with
grapes
zinia
was
very
dark
supple
and
strong
she
had
large
kind
african
eyes
and
beautiful
teeth
and
she
moved
with
an
ample
and
conscious
majesty
miss
darcy
loved
to
watch
her
the
evening
before
a
collie
lay
upon
the
steps
miss
darcy
asked
of
him
tam
he
gone
with
mr
dick
zinia
stood
by
a
pillar
watching
with
kind
eyes
the
visitor
evident
enjoyment
of
her
breakfast
miss
darcy
had
noted
before
and
noted
now
the
lack
of
any
servility
at
sweet
rocket
they
all
seemed
too
much
a
part
of
one
another
for
that
but
there
was
also
that
fine
courtesy
and
feeling
that
did
not
speak
out
of
the
way
when
speech
was
not
wanted
they
all
seemed
to
sail
upon
some
inner
current
of
understanding
she
finished
breakfast
and
rising
helped
zinia
to
carry
away
the
table
dining
room
and
pantry
shone
clean
and
simple
zinia
had
flowers
in
the
pantry
and
upon
the
shelf
below
the
china
press
an
open
book
miss
darcy
glanced
what
are
you
reading
progress
yes
said
zinia
in
her
rich
voice
i
like
that
girl
mercy
the
house
was
clean
and
sunny
still
and
yet
singing
somehow
like
a
great
shell
held
to
ear
she
walked
about
and
at
last
went
out
into
the
high
morning
and
the
flower
garden
the
brick
paths
glistened
box
smelled
sweet
mignonette
and
citronalis
around
flowed
bird
life
and
a
vast
insect
life
multitudinous
song
and
hum
and
chirr
fell
into
harmony
she
walked
up
and
down
the
paths
and
partook
of
garden
amusements
then
went
out
by
a
wicket
gate
and
found
herself
near
the
outdoor
kitchen
a
brown
was
seated
on
the
stone
step
she
stopped
before
him
good
morning
mahning
what
is
your
name
just
so
just
so
yass
mimy
appeared
in
the
doorway
mimy
was
a
small
woman
with
a
face
like
a
carved
cherry
stone
for
wrinkles
he
my
grandson
just
so
i
heard
you
singing
said
miss
darcy
i
loved
it
singing
like
butter
on
the
griddle
said
mimy
it
helps
you
turn
things
she
sighed
portentously
and
then
she
groaned
i
had
a
lot
of
things
to
turn
yes
i
lived
long
and
turned
a
lot
of
things
her
voice
was
gloom
and
yet
carried
more
than
a
suspicion
of
rich
chuckle
she
enjoyed
her
old
woes
disaster
had
grown
so
shallow
i
too
thought
the
visitor
have
had
a
lot
of
things
to
turn
i
too
have
come
to
where
i
can
stand
back
and
see
the
drama
and
feel
the
play
thrill
just
so
was
a
solemn
young
one
he
sat
and
gazed
as
though
in
contemplation
of
the
many
things
he
would
have
to
turn
then
a
brown
hen
came
by
and
he
put
out
a
brown
toe
and
dug
in
the
earth
and
said
shoo
and
laughed
miss
darcy
left
him
playing
with
a
string
of
spools
and
a
broken
coffee
mill
mimy
in
the
kitchen
was
toasting
coffee
and
singing
the
coffee
smelled
better
than
good
the
singing
was
without
age
in
the
voice
who
built
the
ark
oh
noah
built
the
ark
it
rained
forty
days
and
it
rained
forty
nights
ai
any
sun
and
there
ai
any
heights
oh
noah
built
the
ark
miss
darcy
path
led
on
to
the
barn
cocks
and
hens
white
and
red
held
the
barnyard
she
watched
them
with
pleasure
and
the
sun
on
the
gray
walls
and
the
barn
swallows
going
in
and
out
then
she
found
mancy
sitting
under
a
shed
mending
a
wagon
shaft
good
morning
good
morning
it
a
lovely
day
it
is
so
you
from
the
city
are
you
yes
i
hope
you
like
sweet
rocket
i
do
it
makes
you
feel
whole
mancy
glanced
at
her
he
was
a
long
brown
man
with
features
between
negro
and
indian
what
you
liked
very
much
was
his
smile
it
dropped
over
his
face
slowly
like
sun
on
brown
hills
out
of
quiet
cloudy
weather
that
a
true
saying
he
offered
that
what
i
think
about
heaven
we
just
feel
and
know
that
we
well
and
whole
the
mind
said
the
negro
is
a
religious
character
he
is
always
willing
to
talk
of
the
lord
and
of
heaven
all
the
little
torn
bits
coming
together
finished
mancy
he
sat
mending
the
wagon
shaft
it
came
to
her
standing
watching
him
to
say
something
of
the
distracted
and
warring
earth
his
slow
smile
stole
again
over
his
face
yes
we
hurt
ourselves
right
often
you
call
it
that
hurting
oneself
yes
what
do
you
call
it
i
do
know
i
suppose
it
hurting
one
self
suicidal
mania
she
thought
perhaps
all
the
history
i
have
ever
taught
has
been
the
story
of
self
hurt
and
self
heal
perhaps
we
fight
our
self
in
europe
and
asia
and
america
perhaps
in
the
tissue
wide
as
space
centers
here
and
centers
there
are
beginning
to
learn
self
heal
above
self
hurt
she
stood
looking
at
the
mountains
while
mancy
worked
on
at
the
wagon
shaft
presently
she
said
you
would
say
that
this
was
a
very
lonely
place
but
i
have
touched
a
thousand
things
since
i
came
that
run
out
and
touch
everywhere
mountains
are
walls
said
mancy
she
left
the
barn
and
walked
on
to
the
orchard
the
apples
had
been
gathered
but
a
few
red
orbs
yet
hung
from
the
branches
she
walked
beneath
the
trees
and
she
thought
of
old
dull
troubles
and
anxieties
that
had
attended
her
life
this
morning
light
seemed
at
work
among
them
disintegrating
them
the
sun
came
down
between
the
trees
the
air
blew
soft
and
fine
she
returned
to
the
house
and
upon
the
porch
steps
found
cliff
with
baskets
to
sell
woven
of
splits
in
a
mountain
cabin
by
her
son
and
herself
she
was
waiting
for

content
to

iv
in
the
afternoon
the
three
and
tam
went
for
a
walk
they
crossed
the
river
by
a
footbridge
and
walked
a
mile
by
waterside
this
brought
them
to
valley
end
the
stream
slipped
on
between
hills
but
the
strollers
turned
aside
into
a
glade
from
which
the
greater
forest
had
been
cut
young
trees
and
tall
old
trees
were
set
with
some
spareness
all
wore
robes
like
princes
all
glowed
in
a
dream
of
spring
behind
winter
the
ground
had
gray
moss
and
green
moss
and
all
manner
of
minute
and
charming
growths
the
sun
so
came
into
this
glade
that
the
wild
grape
found
and
took
advantage
it
leaned
its
shaggy
stem
against
trunks
it
climbed
and
overran
and
made
bridges
from
tree
to
tree
its
festoons
shone
aloft
its
broad
leaves
and
blue
clusters
dreamed
against
autumn
sky
the
air
breathed
dry
and
fine
sunshine
lay
on
ground
in
shafts
and
plaques
of
gold
richard
linden
used
a
staff
marget
kept
near
him
and
tam
just
ahead
walking
so
you
would
not
think
he
was
a
blind
man
indeed
he
seemed
to
have
a
sixth
sense
he
moved
so
easily
the
three
walked
without
much
speech
the
day
was
the
sumptuous
speaker
these
woods
this
feather
air
the
admirable
poise
of
the
year
before
its
journey
from
hearth
fire
the
plain
chant
of
the
crickets
the
trill
of
the
bird
in
a
roll
over
his
shoulder
linden
carried
a
wide
and
thick
plaid
presently
marget
said
let
us
rest
before
we
turn
back
miss
darcy
is
the
tramp
that
we
are
whereupon
they
pitched
camp
for
half
an
hour
spreading
the
plaid
beneath
a
tree
richard
linden
resting
against
a
chance
bowlder
locked
his
hands
behind
his
head
and
lifted
his
face
to
the
high
free
sky
marget
took
off
her
wide
hat
and
lay
down
beside
miss
darcy
who
sat
on
a
stone
tam
had
the
dry
grass
and
moss
and
the
fringe
of
the
plaid
marget
spoke
we
are
under
a
young
hickory
richard
it
is
all
gold
there
is
a
dogwood
close
by
and
its
leaves
are
red
and
it
is
very
full
of
berries
wild
grape
has
started
by
the
dogwood
and
crossed
to
the
hickory
it
is
far
and
near
and
up
and
down
the
leaves
are
half
green
and
half
yellow
and
there
are
a
thousand
bunches
of
grapes
i
see
he
said
and
i
hear
a
woodpecker
it
yonder
on
a
white
oak
it
a
flicker
there
is
a
cloud
in
the
sky
and
far
far
up
small
as
a
dragon
fly
is
a
buzzard
sailing
there
a
cedar
waxwing
in
the
dogwood
stripping
berries
there
is
another
a
third
we
frightened
them
away
but
they
are
coming
back
they
after
the
grapes
there
will
be
fifty
in
a
moment
they
kept
still
and
watched
marget
hand
on
tam
slender
graceful
tawny
crested
birds
came
in
a
flock
they
entered
the
hickory
and
the
dogwood
with
quick
movements
of
head
and
body
they
stripped
the
grapes
and
the
scarlet
dogwood
berries
they
perched
and
removed
and
perched
again
they
kept
up
a
low
talk
among
themselves
and
a
perpetual
flutter
of
wings
it
was
as
though
a
wind
were
in
the
trees
so
continuous
was
the
sound
blue
grapes
dogwood
berries
dropped
upon
the
ground
for
ten
minutes
the
flock
fluttered
and
fed
while
with
intent
pleased
faces
the
human
beings
watched
or
listened
then
tam
became
aware
of
a
rabbit
down
the
glade
and
started
up
away
flew
the
cedar
waxwings
oh
was
it
lovely
they
sat
still
richard
linden
resting
against
the
rock
kept
his
face
raised
to
blue
sky
their
life
he
said
as
we
enter
upon
their
life
tam
came
back
the
rabbit
having
vanished
lie
still
tam
lie
still
get
into
your
for
a
little
and
be
quiet
shepherd
on
a
hill
instead
of
shepherd
dog
their
life
the
visitor
to
sweet
rocket
sat
still
with
her
eyes
upon
the
gold
fretwork
of
the
hickory
she
was
thinking
of
the
birds
it
was
very
sunny
very
still
in
the
glade
her
companions
also
rested
silent
they
seemed
to
be
in
reverie
to
be
going
where
they
would
in
their
inner
worlds
miss
darcy
followed
the
waxwings
in
their
flight
she
saw
the
flock
that
had
been
here
and
other
flocks
stripping
wild
grape
and
dogwood
and
cedar
berries
they
were
far
and
near
in
many
a
woodland
glade
in
thousands
they
twined
and
turned
they
talked
in
the
clan
their
wings
made
a
windy
sound
and
the
woodpeckers
hammer
and
hammer
through
the
forests
of
the
world
and
the
thrush
that
she
had
heard
this
morning
and
the
humming
bird
in
the
garden
and
the
crows
that
had
cawed
from
a
hillside
the
hawk
and
the
owl
suddenly
she
saw
in
some
space
an
eagle
rise
to
its
nest
upon
a
crag
edge
from
the
one
she
saw
others
eagles
in
all
the
lands
for
one
instant
she
caught
a
far
glimpse
of
the
idea
the
absolute
eagle
there
was
the
rush
of
a
loftier
sense
then
she
sank
from
that
but
she
saw
eagles
in
all
the
lands
she
saw
the
great
hawks
and
the
condors
green
waves
were
beneath
her
with
sea
birds
she
skimmed
them
in
the
first
light
and
the
cries
of
her
kind
were
about
her
on
the
ice
floes
walked
the
penguins
the
albatross
winnowed
solitude
with
heron
and
flamingo
and
crane
she
knew
shore
and
marsh
the
white
swan
and
the
black
swan
oared
their
way
through
still
waters
in
their
right
circle
moved
the
peacock
and
the
pheasant
the
lyre
bird
the
bower
bird
and
the
bird
of
paradise
the
nightingale
sang
in
deep
woods
and
in
southern
thickets
of
yellow
jessamine
sang
the
mocking
bird
the
lark
mounted
into
the
air
the
cuckoo
called
from
the
hedge
the
wren
built
under
the
eaves
in
the
gray
dawn
from
a
thousand
farms
and
hamlets
crowed
the
cocks
over
all
the
earth
clucked
the
hen
peeped
the
downy
chick
the
swallows
crossed
a
saffron
sky
and
the
whippoorwill
cried
in
the
night
and
in
the
morning
the
quails
said
bob
white
migrating
hordes
like
scuds
of
clouds
drove
before
favorable
winds
north
south
she
was
plunged
in
the
life
of
birds
where
they
waded
between
deep
water
and
solid
shore
where
they
lived
in
a
world
of
green
where
they
flew
aloft
and
afar
over
land
over
sea
all
their
plumage
shapes
and
magnitudes
she
seemed
to
hear
their
cheepings
cries
and
songs
to
hear
them
and
touch
them
their
sleekness
lightness
threaded
beauty
over
all
the
earth
spread
the
passionate
wooing
the
daylong
song
here
were
the
nests
the
multitudes
and
the
eggs
green
and
blue
and
white
and
dark
the
nests
and
eggs
became
transfigured
the
straw
of
the
nests
burned
lines
of
white
fire
the
cup
was
diamond
light
the
shell
of
the
egg
no
more
than
a
window
and
through
it
was
seen
the
and
the
bird
desire
and
will
and
power
out
of
the
egg
the
young
she
heard
the
nightingales
in
the
woods
the
lark
in
the
sky
see
the
love
and
beauty
and
power
and
daring
see
the
thought
and
feeling
pressing
on
see
them
trooping
into
fuller
being
see
them
men
and
women
their
tribes
and
nations
when
we
have
gone
far
far
on
see
their
human
earth
it
was
linden
she
thought
who
said
that
she
came
back
with
a
great
throb
of
her
heart
to
the
earth
beneath
a
golden
hickory
to
the
october
sun
in
a
little
virginian
valley
yet
the
two
reclining
there
seemed
still
in
a
brown
study
gone
away
she
thought
i
am
come
into
a
strange
country
are
they
knowing
feeling
all
that
life
more
intensely
than
i
for
all
that
they
lie
there
so
quietly
thinking
one
would
say
of
work
of
a
book
they
are
reading
or
of
the
cedar
waxwings
it
is
all
in
the
range
of
perception
could
i
run
like
light
all
over
the
earth
there
are
those
birds
and
their
life
i
only
saw
what
but
she
felt
that
while
she
had
had
a
wave
of
it
those
two
had
a
whole
breadth
of
ocean
she
felt
that
they
were
expert
adept
she
felt
again
the
breath
of
wonder
it
was
at
once
wonder
and
homelikeness
glad
glad
glad
that
i
came
my
gray
road
turns
richard
linden
dropped
his
hands
from
behind
his
head
and
passed
them
over
his
eyes
marget
rose
to
her
knees
there
was
deep
light
in
her
face
she
lifted
then
let
fall
her
arms
oh
the
when
life
is
seen
as
a
landscape
heard
as
a
symphony
smelled
as
a
garden
tasted
as
nectar
dwelt
in
as
a
house
she
rose
to
her
feet
the
sun
is
gone
from
the
grass
it
is
dawn
in
tibet
come
tam
let
us
be
going
home
they
folded
the
plaid
and
left
the
hickory
and
the
dogwood
the
glade
was
turning
violet
but
the
hilltops
showed
golden
and
the
mountains
stood
in
light
a
rich
scent
breathed
from
the
earth
while
the
air
carried
a
spear
from
the
north
leaving
the
wood
they
took
again
the
path
by
the
river
that
sang
toward
them
that
held
pools
of
light
walking
so
marget
fell
to
talking
of
anna
darcy
life
the
manner
of
it
her
steadfast
work
from
year
to
year
and
all
her
kindnesses
and
all
that
she
had
given
at
first
miss
darcy
tried
to
stop
her
but
then
she
could
not
try
any
longer
the
appreciation
was
so
sweet
her
life
had
been
difficult
isolated
for
all
the
stir
around
her
subject
to
sorrows
a
little
withered
and
gray
she
felt
the
exquisite
caress
of
their
interest
it
was
more
than
that
to
her
it
was
recognition
how
would
it
be
if
all
were
truly
interested
in
all
if
there
were
general
recognition
as
she
walked
the
valley
and
the
hills
the
river
and
warm
dusky
air
the
collie
the
man
and
woman
with
her
herself
seemed
to
shift
and
quiver
into
one
walls
vanished
there
happened
rest
understanding
imperviousness
to
harm
blood
warmth
and
new
and
strange
aspiration
it
was
impossible
for
her
to
hold
the
moment
she
seemed
to
herself
to
sink
again
to
the
rigid
and
small
shape
of
anna
darcy
like
an
egyptian
figure
graved
on
stone
a
plane
figure
but
she
did
not
wholly
fit
back
into
the
figure
she
felt
that
above
it
was
fullness
and
youth
and
song
and
that
they
were
hers
as
well
as
another
v
again
the
next
morning
she
found
neither
of
her
hosts
we
breakfast
early
and
work
early
marget
had
said
again
zinia
served
her
alone
again
she
walked
in
the
flower
garden
again
she
went
farther
afield
the
day
was
brilliantly
vividly
clear
white
clouds
in
the
sky
and
between
great
seas
of
cobalt
she
went
at
once
to
the
river
path
but
turned
this
morning
up
the
stream
the
day
hung
joyous
the
high
and
moving
clouds
the
light
and
shadow
had
magnificence
she
felt
very
well
she
really
looked
five
years
younger
before
her
beyond
a
spur
of
orchard
she
made
out
the
roof
of
a
building
when
she
came
nearer
she
felt
an
assurance
that
this
was
the
overseer
house
where
marget
was
born
she
thought
where
she
lived
with
her
father
and
mother
and
brothers
presently
she
stood
still
to
regard
the
place
the
house
was
a
small
one
frame
painted
white
with
green
blinds
it
had
a
small
porch
with
a
window
to
either
side
at
the
back
she
made
out
a
wider
porch
and
there
were
outbuildings
the
whole
was
buried
among
locust
trees
and
old
shrubs
that
when
she
came
nearer
she
recognized
for
lilac
and
althea
and
syringa
door
and
windows
stood
open
at
first
she
thought
she
would
turn
from
the
river
to
the
house
but
then
she
said
no
not
till
she
herself
brings
me
here
some
day
but
the
place
was
plain
before
her
where
she
stood
when
she
had
moved
a
few
paces
she
looked
full
to
the
door
between
locust
trees
and
bushes
she
was
now
beside
a
giant
sycamore
very
old
all
copper
colored
as
to
leaf
with
dappled
white
and
brown
arms
built
around
the
bole
was
a
wooden
bench
old
and
she
played
here
when
she
was
a
child
they
have
all
set
here
beneath
this
tree
she
comes
here
now
i
fancy
often
she
took
her
seat
no
one
came
in
or
out
of
the
house
door
a
throw
away
the
place
was
sunny
and
deserted
there
came
as
it
were
a
veil
over
it
she
shut
her
eyes
the
better
to
look
at
child
life
here
with
father
and
mother
and
will
and
edgar
the
old
overseer
who
had
fought
in
the
war
for
the
old
order
but
who
when
it
came
crash
had
built
in
the
new
and
the
mother
elizabeth
land
overworked
and
uncomplaining
and
the
boys
with
their
desires
and
broodings
and
hopes
she
felt
them
all
sitting
with
her
eyes
shut
she
passed
into
feeling
them
very
strongly
the
place
turned
to
be
of
thirty
forty
years
ago
she
moved
with
the
overseer
as
he
went
to
his
work
and
came
from
it
with
marget
mother
she
was
cooking
sewing
cleaning
she
was
with
the
three
children
the
boys
older
than
the
girl
at
tasks
and
in
play
swim
in
the
river
swing
under
the
locust
tree
go
for
berries
for
persimmons
chinquapins
walnuts
for
grapes
and
haws
go
for
the
cow
work
in
the
garden
patch
shell
the
peas
shuck
the
corn
look
for
eggs
pick
the
currants
and
gooseberries
split
the
kindling
gather
the
chips
wash
the
dishes
clean
the
lamps
sit
by
the
fire
and
study
reading
writing
and
arithmetic
she
was
deep
in
it
deep
in
a
slow
steady
current
of
participation
it
did
not
seem
to
curve
but
now
it
was
her
own
childhood
her
parents
and
brothers
and
sisters
an
old
town
house
and
a
leafy
town
square
life
life
so
varied
and
so
the
same
deep
deep
wash
of
deep
waves
and
so
pleasant
so
sweet
all
the
pang
and
ill
lost
a
past
that
was
winnowed
understood
forgiven
appreciated
loved
by
mind
and
heart
of
farther
on
and
that
was
present
gone
nowhere
here
in
finer
space
and
finer
time
a
vast
country
capable
of
being
visited
going
into
it
was
to
find
the
deathless
taste
of
eternity
it
was
not
dark
you
could
fill
it
with
golden
light
the
forms
there
were
not
immovable
not
dead
as
you
understood
they
lived
and
were
yourself
as
you
remembered
you
saw
that
you
were
remembering
that
you
were
from
far
and
near
your
self
anna
darcy
sat
very
still
i
had
to
wait
till
i
was
years
old
to
see
that
as
on
yesterday
it
had
grown
out
of
a
commonplace
of
imagination
and
memory
memory
and
imagination
had
by
degrees
entered
deeper
selves
again
as
on
yesterday
she
could
not
hold
it
increased
energy
increased
perception
what
the
ancients
called
the
genius
and
the
mystic
called
illumination
or
voice
of
god
and
the
moderns
higher
vibration
superconsciousness
whatever
it
was
and
perhaps
the
name
did
not
much
matter
she
had
touched
it
and
then
lost
it
but
she
knew
that
it
had
been
touched
and
that
it
was
desirable
to
know
it
or
its
like
again
she
was
a
member
of
the
church
a
praying
woman
she
bent
her
forehead
upon
her
hands
o
god
let
thy
kingdom
come
as
it
comes
near
us
send
thy
breezes
presently
rising
she
went
on
up
the
stream
it
was
not
wide
it
just
came
into
the
category
of
river
headwater
she
knew
of
a
greater
river
october
painted
it
with
russets
and
golds
and
reds
midcurrent
showed
the
ineffable
blue
of
the
sky
or
when
clouds
drove
by
the
zenith
the
clouds
she
walked
on
until
before
her
she
saw
the
eastern
gate
of
the
vale
the
hills
closed
in
leaving
a
bit
of
grassy
meadow
on
either
side
the
stream
this
narrowed
the
hills
grew
loftier
insensibly
became
mountains
she
was
in
a
mountain
pass
gray
cliff
to
the
right
hemlocks
overhanging
the
water
that
was
broken
now
by
bowlders
débris
of
an
ancient
rock
the
path
was
cool
and
dark
and
washed
by
the
scent
of
the
conifers
only
here
and
there
the
climbing
sun
sent
splashing
through
an
intensity
of
light
that
showed
every
fallen
needle
every
cone
or
twig
or
leaf
upon
the
path
not
far
before
her
the
path
turned
and
went
up
over
the
mountain
she
thought
that
will
be
the
way
to
mrs
cliff
she
came
upon
a
fisherman
he
sat
among
the
roots
of
a
hemlock
and
was
engaged
in
reeling
in
his
line
he
was
a
man
neither
old
nor
young
with
a
long
easy
frame
and
a
short
graying
beard
his
dress
was
that
of
a
fisherman
who
goes
forth
from
the
city
to
fish
but
not
for
the
first
nor
the
second
nor
the
third
time
nothing
that
he
had
on
was
new
but
all
was
well
cut
good
morning
he
said
good
morning
he
worked
on
at
his
reel
each
time
that
i
do
this
i
say
that
it
is
the
last
time
why
i
grow
too
damned
able
i
beg
your
pardon
to
put
myself
in
the
place
have
you
caught
any
this
morning
not
a
ghost
of
one
yet
they
say
this
is
a
good
stream
i
think
that
i
warn
them
off
the
hook
black
bass
or
signor
trout
as
it
may
be
my
desire
not
to
take
you
is
gaining
i
feel
upon
my
desire
to
take
you
your
own
desire
naturally
aiding
the
first
i
grow
to
feel
that
we
make
a
strong
combination
he
laughed
putting
up
his
rod
then
his
mustaches
went
down
and
his
face
became
serious
enough
so
much
mangling
i
had
my
fill
how
did
you
come
over
the
mountain
yes
i
am
camping
with
a
dozen
new
york
and
washington
fellows
on
another
little
river
over
there
the
others
fish
that
stream
i
like
elton
i
adore
exploring
i
slept
last
night
in
a
mountain
cabin
cliff
can
you
tell
me
how
far
i
am
from
sweet
rocket
farm
less
than
a
mile
no
i
did
think
from
what
the
mountain
folk
said
that
it
was
so
near
i
knew
before
i
came
that
he
was
somewhere
in
these
parts
do
you
know
mr
linden
i
was
his
classmate
at
the
university
then
fifteen
years
ago
i
met
him
in
southern
russia
we
had
a
couple
of
weeks
together
and
then
i
must
hurry
on
to
constantinople
where
i
was
due
he
went
into
the
caucasus
i
lost
sight
of
him
it
was
two
years
later
that
i
heard
of
that
accident
which
blinded
him
and
i
heard
since
only
things
the
other
day
in
the
club
a
man
told
me
that
he
was
living
where
his
people
had
lived
down
here
in
virginia
i
meant
to
go
to
see
him
but
i
meant
to
write
first
i
am
a
visitor
at
sweet
rocket
but
i
am
sure
that
linden
would
wish
you
to
come
on
to
the
house
had
you
not
better
do
so
why
yes
then
i
think
that
i
shall
he
stood
up
from
the
hemlock
roots
you
are
very
good
my
name
is
curtin
martin
curtin
she
gave
her
own
he
took
up
fisherman
paraphernalia
and
a
light
coat
they
moved
out
of
ravine
into
meadow
strip
before
them
lay
the
jewel
valley
curtin
drew
a
deep
breath
and
he
has
eyes
to
look
at
it
anna
darcy
found
herself
answering
with
certitude
he
sees
it
and
a
thousand
places
beside
they
walked
on
curtin
gazing
at
river
hills
and
mountains
and
quiet
valley
floor
i
have
known
of
his
doing
some
splendid
things
in
life
simple
and
splendid
the
kind
that
steals
into
folk
and
they
do
likewise
yes
i
should
think
that
what
is
that
house
in
old
times
it
is
the
overseer
house
now
the
young
farmer
who
helps
him
lives
there
old
times
it
that
an
unusual
phrase
i
mean
that
to
me
for
reasons
it
stays
that
way
and
i
agree
when
you
turn
to
a
thing
it
turn
with
decision
enough
and
your
overseer
would
come
out
to
meet
you
that
a
sycamore
for
you
do
you
ever
feel
the
indians
by
these
streams
if
you
can
see
your
overseer
you
can
see
your
indians
too
they
walked
on
is
that
the
house
yes
it
a
simple
place
too
but
i
like
it
houses
now
i
make
a
specialty
of
keeping
them
in
duration
anna
darcy
thought
a
week
ago
i
would
have
understood
that
the
house
where
she
was
born
the
house
facing
across
a
row
of
box
and
a
finely
wrought
iron
paling
the
old
leafy
city
square
walked
bodily
into
her
she
was
through
it
up
and
down
like
the
air
it
seemed
to
her
that
there
was
anything
she
did
know
about
it
and
it
all
came
together
into
an
inner
aroma
taste
and
tone
dry
warm
pungent
and
likable
idiosyncratic
its
very
own
it
had
been
a
loss
a
grief
when
the
city
had
taken
and
torn
down
that
house
and
all
the
time
it
was
waiting
for
her
in
a
deep
reality
to
walk
in
and
take
possession
she
thought
what
is
happening
i
shall
never
be
lonely
again
curtin
looked
from
side
to
side
of
sweet
rocket
valley
it
like
a
beaker
of
venetian
glass
you
say
there
was
a
magic
drink
in
it
but
how
clean
and
drenched
with
sun
is
this
air
yes
he
never
married
archer
said
he
thought
not
no
he
did
marry
he
rather
the
kind
that
marries
the
world
yes
i
think
so
we
turn
here
to
the
house
have
you
the
time
it
almost
noon
he
will
be
home
then
he
works
upon
the
farm
as
though
he
had
eyes
they
left
the
pebbly
beach
and
went
by
the
cedars
up
to
the
house
tam
came
to
meet
them
and
linden
rose
from
the
bench
upon
the
porch
vi
and
so
he
was
killed
said
curtin
speaking
with
strongly
controlled
emotion
and
i
can
tell
you
that
when
i
heard
it
i
felt
physically
that
shock
and
crash
and
mortal
bruising
it
was
only
my
heart
that
was
wounded
my
nerves
and
my
flesh
felt
it
even
now
i
think
that
there
must
be
but
one
body
i
got
away
for
a
time
after
he
was
buried
i
went
down
to
hyères
i
used
to
sit
there
by
the
sea
he
was
a
lovable
fellow
square
as
they
make
them
we
were
brothers
and
friends
too
well
that
is
the
way
it
runs
life
death
life
death
i
would
give
a
good
deal
he
had
been
hours
at
sweet
rocket
they
had
sent
up
mountain
to
cliff
who
took
down
to
his
camp
news
that
he
would
be
gone
for
some
days
they
had
given
him
the
room
next
to
linden
and
he
had
become
at
once
delightfully
at
home
when
with
miss
darcy
he
had
stepped
upon
the
porch
linden
had
said
do
think
you
take
me
by
surprise
i
saw
you
in
my
this
morning
it
is
good
to
find
you
again
linden
what
do
you
mean
by
your
linden
laughed
his
hands
upon
the
old
classmate
shoulders
only
that
i
had
been
thinking
of
you
and
the
other
night
i
was
with
you
by
the
sea
of
azof
i
thought
should
like
to
see
him
again
and
you
know
yourself
that
when
you
make
a
current
boats
appear
upon
it
now
as
the
four
sat
about
the
fire
in
the
big
parlor
before
the
lamp
was
lighted
he
had
been
telling
of
the
death
of
his
brother
an
aviator
there
had
followed
silence
then
well
let
us
talk
of
something
else
said
curtin
he
took
up
the
pipe
he
had
laid
upon
the
hearth
beside
him
and
raking
out
a
coat
from
the
fire
relit
it
what
do
you
think
is
going
to
happen
now
linden
they
sat
and
talked
and
the
flames
leaped
many
and
small
in
the
mahogany
of
the
room
at
ten
they
rose
to
separate
for
the
night
come
look
at
the
sky
said
linden
the
first
week
in
october
and
diamond
clear
they
went
out
to
the
porch
and
then
so
majestic
was
the
night
to
the
sweep
before
the
house
whence
they
might
see
the
great
expanse
it
was
very
still
the
river
sounded
but
the
air
rested
a
thin
and
moveless
veil
it
was
not
cold
richard
linden
stood
bareheaded
his
face
uplifted
to
the
vault
that
writes
forever
its
runes
before
men
by
george
i
forgot
thought
curtin
but
doubtless
he
knows
them
so
well
that
he
knows
where
they
are
season
by
season
it
seemed
that
it
might
be
so
linden
spoke
as
though
he
saw
see
the
pleiades
and
capella
and
aldebaran
the
great
square
is
at
its
height
the
cross
and
the
eagle
and
the
lyre
the
mountains
hide
fomalhaut
they
walked
a
little
way
upon
the
road
immense
and
tingling
was
that
view
looking
outward
looking
inward
upon
those
stars
at
last
they
came
indoors
and
said
good
night
martin
curtin
lay
in
a
big
bed
and
stared
out
of
window
upon
going
to
bed
he
had
slept
quickly
and
soundly
now
he
was
awake
and
he
thought
it
might
be
past
four
of
the
morning
he
felt
the
subtle
turn
toward
the
day
he
heard
a
dog
bark
and
a
cock
crow
he
was
aware
that
he
had
waked
suddenly
and
completely
he
was
wide
awake
and
more
than
that
there
was
a
keenness
an
awareness
keen
sharpened
but
also
wide
his
body
lying
very
still
he
began
to
remember
but
it
was
remembering
with
a
deeper
and
fuller
pulse
than
was
ordinarily
the
case
he
remembered
that
younger
brother
who
was
dead
and
not
him
alone
but
many
another
kindred
and
friends
and
associates
the
past
lived
again
but
lived
with
a
difference
what
multitudes
of
kindred
and
friends
and
associates
the
meeting
went
deep
and
wide
had
he
touched
all
those
in
one
life
or
had
it
been
in
many
lives
was
the
whole
texture
coming
alive
and
in
effect
did
it
include
the
whole
past
the
whole
dead
and
gone
however
it
might
be
it
was
a
world
transmuted
and
without
pain
he
lay
still
regarding
it
it
was
strong
and
light
and
he
and
it
grew
together
with
a
sense
of
frictionlessness
of
exquisite
relief
even
with
a
kind
of
golden
humorousness
none
had
been
truly
any
better
or
worse
than
another
nor
in
any
way
miraculously
different
and
now
they
could
understand
and
laugh
together
the
sense
of
union
was
exquisite
and
the
sense
of
variousness
hardly
less
so
the
variousness
was
without
hostility
it
glided
and
turned
smoothly
much
as
personal
thought
and
mood
might
glide
and
turn
the
sense
of
flowed
in
every
realm
the
perception
included
environment
remembered
recalled
persons
meant
remembered
recalled
houses
towns
country
forest
and
river
fields
and
gardens
a
thousand
thousand
places
where
were
they
all
they
were
all
over
the
earth
light
and
golden
loved
places
and
the
right
people
in
them
there
was
nothing
rigid
even
the
places
understood
one
another
curtin
felt
a
profound
happiness
this
one
body
lying
at
sweet
rocket
was
not
wholly
forgot
nor
relinquished
it
came
into
the
pattern
of
variousness
but
curtin
himself
was
moving
in
a
wider
consciousness
all
these
people
all
these
selves
of
himself
and
he
understood
their
old
difficulties
and
he
understood
their
old
misunderstandings
the
understood
the
beautiful
tissue
the
music
understood
the
notes
moving
so
richly
together
it
was
throbbing
in
the
present
and
in
the
understood
the
appropriated
past
he
never
thought
how
grotesque
the
thought
that
we
are
dead
the
thought
could
not
even
occur
for
one
flash
for
less
than
an
instant
the
plane
lifted
there
started
forth
a
high
a
tremendous
sense
of
unity
presence
it
towered
it
overflowed
him
he
was
of
it
then
the
instant
closed
as
it
had
come
like
a
towering
wave
so
it
sank
like
a
wave
but
there
was
left
the
lasting
thrill
of
it
and
there
was
left
undying
aspiration
ah
to
find
it
again
ah
if
it
will
come
again
where
had
been
sense
of
the
whole
again
befell
fragmentariness
loss
great
loss
and
yet
was
there
falling
sweetness
exquisiteness
still
of
order
he
felt
again
the
wide
world
that
they
said
was
dead
and
yet
surely
was
no
such
thing
there
happened
again
wide
and
subtle
change
out
of
a
stillness
a
silence
an
isolation
exquisite
and
tingling
a
state
of
clarity
and
poise
one
spoke
to
him
martin
he
answered
in
that
space
yes
john
no
grief
is
absurd
just
because
we
ignorant
you
can
be
content
we
can
be
content
yes
i
see
we
are
all
in
one
who
can
not
be
destroyed
there
came
no
more
but
the
world
was
a
rhythm
swinging
swinging
there
reigned
great
rest
and
calm
out
of
this
with
much
of
it
yet
clinging
he
sank
to
the
square
clean
sparely
furnished
bedroom
at
sweet
rocket
with
the
cock
crowing
with
the
old
clock
in
the
lower
hall
striking
five
curtin
lay
very
quiet
in
the
big
bed
dawn
was
coming
but
his
sense
was
that
of
an
afterglow
he
had
felt
beauty
and
still
wonder
like
this
in
high
mountains
watching
alpine
glow
it
faded
and
faded
but
there
was
left
with
him
assurance
rest
the
sense
of
a
dawn
to
be
a
consciousness
behind
this
consciousness
another
consciousness
towering
in
the
future
he
lay
very
still
at
rest
hardly
wondering
the
great
things
the
beautiful
things
were
the
natural
things
the
wholly
full
and
blissful
would
be
the
finally
natural
dawn
came
in
rose
and
amethyst
when
it
was
full
light
curtin
left
his
bed
dressed
and
went
downstairs
he
thought
that
he
would
walk
by
the
river
or
in
the
garden
the
house
was
still
the
front
door
open
early
though
it
was
he
found
linden
on
the
porch
starting
forth
with
tam
he
had
found
he
said
that
he
must
see
roger
carter
who
was
riding
to
alder
and
would
be
starting
presently
will
you
walk
with
me
but
you
should
miss
your
breakfast
i
had
bread
and
milk
i
wo
go
now
answered
curtin
i
walk
up
and
down
before
the
house
for
a
while
something
happened
to
me
last
night
or
i
happened
into
something
i
like
to
talk
to
you
about
it
linden
but
it
fade
before
you
come
back
i
do
indeed
think
it
will
ever
fade
there
was
that
in
linden
remembered
face
when
linden
himself
had
gone
away
toward
roger
carter
that
made
curtin
think
walking
now
before
the
house
as
they
had
walked
the
night
before
under
the
stars
does
he
know
what
i
felt
could
he
even
have
helped
put
a
shoulder
to
the
wheel
seeing
that
i
was
grieved
and
uncertain
not
so
long
ago
he
might
have
answered
that
fantastic
but
he
did
not
so
answer
now
he
went
into
the
garden
and
walked
up
and
down
before
seven
marget
came
out
to
him
i
saw
you
walking
in
the
dawn
like
a
man
in
a
ballad
could
you
not
sleep
i
slept
till
nearly
five
they
walked
by
the
late
asters
and
the
stocks
said
curtin
i
remember
a
line
of
masefield
the
dim
room
had
mind
and
seemed
to
brood
and
again
and
felt
the
hillside
thronged
by
souls
unseen
who
knew
the
interest
in
me
and
were
keen
that
man
alive
should
understand
man
dead
miss
land
do
you
think
that
is
true
yes
surely
do
you
think
we
can
be
reassured
about
the
dead
all
the
dead
and
ourselves
when
we
die
yes
i
do
very
safe
very
sure
well
i
think
so
this
morning
they
walked
by
the
marigolds
and
larkspur
where
do
you
meet
the
dead
in
this
space
he
indicated
it
with
a
wide
gesture
no
in
space
that
permeates
this
space
in
added
space
when
and
where
we
make
space
though
i
think
said
marget
that
one
day
the
edges
will
have
so
flowed
together
that
we
shall
say
this
space
you
and
richard
linden
both
have
that
assurance
yes
many
have
it
now
she
added
i
think
perhaps
that
it
is
more
easily
felt
in
some
places
than
in
others
he
thought
as
we
put
telescopes
on
heights
they
walked
by
the
wall
with
the
ivy
her
quiet
dark
eyes
were
upon
him
friendly
kindly
he
thought
no
less
than
linden
she
hoped
such
a
night
for
me
perhaps
a
bell
rang
that
is
for
us
miss
darcy
too
comes
down
early
now
they
went
indoors
anna
darcy
met
them
in
the
hall
and
they
went
together
into
the
bright
dining
room
to
their
pleasant
breakfast
and
zinia
waiting
with
that
girl
mercy
still
at
heart
vii
the
next
day
was
sunday
zinia
and
mimy
and
mancy
walked
early
to
their
church
two
miles
down
the
river
marget
and
miss
darcy
linden
and
curtin
went
to
alder
in
the
phaeton
drawn
by
daniel
and
bess
it
was
as
sunny
and
still
a
day
as
might
be
found
in
any
autumn
land
and
most
beauteous
was
that
forest
through
which
they
drove
anna
darcy
was
glad
to
see
it
again
it
rested
forever
in
her
mind
a
true
magic
approach
marget
drove
curtin
sitting
beside
her
miss
darcy
and
richard
linden
behind
them
the
jewel
miles
went
by
and
the
pleasant
pleasant
air
here
rose
alder
on
a
green
hill
and
alder
had
three
streets
a
hundred
dwelling
houses
and
three
churches
the
houses
were
brick
or
frame
with
shady
yards
and
flowers
they
drove
by
a
small
quaint
courthouse
a
rambling
hotel
and
several
stores
closed
the
trees
were
maples
and
lombardy
poplars
and
a
few
ancient
mulberries
folk
were
going
to
church
and
they
spoke
to
sweet
rocket
and
sweet
rocket
to
them
before
them
rose
a
church
of
white
frame
set
in
an
ample
churchyard
all
glowing
maples
with
a
mosaic
of
red
and
gold
leaves
underfoot
street
before
it
and
bordering
lane
held
horses
and
buggies
and
fords
and
buicks
the
second
bell
had
not
rung
men
and
boys
waited
around
the
doors
talk
and
laughter
at
a
sunday
pitch
women
were
entering
some
with
children
in
their
hands
sweet
rocket
folk
leaving
the
phaeton
walking
up
churchyard
path
took
and
gave
greeting
they
entered
the
church
marget
hand
upon
linden
arm
just
guiding
him
to
a
pleasant
pew
by
a
pleasant
open
window
the
weather
being
yet
so
warm
curtin
took
his
seat
and
turning
a
little
watched
the
folk
enter
he
did
not
know
when
he
had
been
in
a
village
church
like
this
nor
indeed
had
he
been
for
long
in
any
church
at
all
barring
the
cathedrals
and
churches
abroad
into
which
he
went
as
artist
a
clear
sweet
sound
overhead
rang
the
second
bell
men
and
youths
came
in
the
building
filled
a
simple
place
it
was
well
proportioned
and
filled
with
a
dreamy
golden
softened
light
in
that
soft
flowing
atmosphere
men
and
women
and
children
were
gathered
as
in
a
bouquet
the
choir
assembled
the
young
woman
who
was
the
organist
took
her
place
a
woman
in
the
pew
behind
curtin
leaned
over
and
gave
him
an
opened
hymn
book
the
minister
appeared
a
kindly
faced
small
elderly
man
the
bouquet
became
more
and
more
sunday
curtin
glanced
at
linden
he
sat
as
always
with
ease
and
a
certain
still
power
he
seemed
to
curtin
as
simple
and
whole
as
a
planet
in
the
sky
this
village
methodist
church
seemed
within
his
frontier
as
when
you
thought
of
it
all
other
places
seemed
within
it
curtin
remembered
they
were
talking
he
and
linden
in
odessa
in
their
hotel
after
having
been
to
a
great
service
in
a
great
church
linden
was
telling
him
that
religion
held
all
religions
and
that
he
linden
belonged
solely
to
no
one
church
but
liked
at
times
to
go
sit
in
any
one
of
them
he
had
gone
on
to
say
other
things
but
curtin
and
curtin
remembered
this
with
a
certain
pang
had
yawned
and
said
that
it
had
been
a
tiring
day
and
that
he
would
off
to
bed
my
god
i
was
crass
in
those
years
thought
curtin
he
still
watched
linden
who
could
not
know
that
he
was
being
watched
and
at
the
thought
linden
turned
his
head
and
smiled
at
him
his
face
said
as
distinctly
as
if
his
voice
had
uttered
it
yes
that
night
at
odessa
again
curtin
startled
at
first
felt
the
startling
vanish
he
thought
and
as
on
last
night
his
thought
seemed
to
lay
hold
upon
and
give
form
to
a
from
some
upper
region
truly
the
startling
should
be
over
mind
broken
from
mind
not
over
mind
beginning
to
heal
he
sat
in
a
deep
study
there
came
like
a
picture
into
his
mind
jesus
of
nazareth
parable
of
the
talents
ability
to
perceive
thought
if
the
world
should
take
that
talent
and
improve
it
a
different
world
we
should
have
anon
let
us
pray
said
the
minister
when
they
had
prayed
he
said
let
us
sing
hymn
number
they
sang
sun
of
my
soul
thou
saviour
dear
it
is
not
night
if
thou
be
near
i
will
read
said
the
minister
from
the
chapter
of
the
gospel
according
to
matthew
curtin
heard
read
the
parable
of
the
talents
he
thought
intercommunication
it
widens
and
deepens
and
heightens
perpetually
now
it
gets
to
be
wireless
independent
of
gesture
or
the
vocal
cords
or
the
handwriting
there
thronged
echoes
of
his
experience
of
the
other
night
intercommunication
becomes
communion
communion
becomes
identity
at
last
know
even
as
we
are
known
the
reading
ended
they
sang
rock
of
ages
cleft
for
me
all
the
congregation
sang
men
women
and
children
piping
voices
they
sat
down
the
minister
took
his
text
from
the
parable
he
had
read
it
was
a
good
plain
sermon
in
which
the
preacher
said
more
than
he
knew
he
said
the
air
came
in
at
window
bees
buzzed
without
a
brown
butterfly
passed
the
congregation
breathed
gently
rhythmically
the
sun
gave
life
to
the
flowers
upon
the
women
and
the
children
hats
there
were
young
faces
and
old
faces
dull
faces
and
quick
faces
intent
faces
and
wandering
faces
some
were
rich
flowers
and
others
little
flowers
not
far
from
weeds
but
all
were
in
the
garden
curtin
thought
they
are
like
the
thoughts
and
moods
of
a
man
many
and
various
but
all
in
the
man
one
man
it
was
balzac
who
said
is
but
one
animal
one
man
his
name
or
humanity
as
you
choose
or
perhaps
when
he
finds
himself
his
name
is
christ
he
looked
again
at
linden
sitting
with
that
pleased
and
quiet
light
upon
his
face
the
sermon
was
not
extraordinary
the
congregation
the
average
village
and
country
congregation
the
church
had
no
especial
grace
of
interior
or
exterior
linden
was
not
to
it
he
did
not
hug
the
letter
of
its
creed
any
one
of
those
around
might
say
no
he
does
not
belong
to
any
church
which
is
a
great
pity
no
it
his
church
yet
curtin
saw
that
linden
sitting
there
loved
this
place
the
feel
of
the
folk
around
him
the
sense
of
what
they
were
doing
were
striving
to
do
and
on
the
whole
were
slowly
doing
he
comprehended
that
to
linden
it
was
very
simply
his
own
as
were
the
other
two
churches
of
alder
and
the
colored
church
down
the
river
and
the
greek
church
at
odessa
he
saw
that
linden
possessive
was
large
linden
and
marget
land
miss
darcy
sat
very
still
her
thin
hands
crossed
in
her
lap
at
first
she
had
listened
to
the
sermon
but
now
she
was
in
the
old
church
in
the
old
city
and
there
was
another
congregation
around
her
and
another
clergyman
a
kinsman
in
the
pulpit
at
first
it
was
like
opening
a
potpourri
jar
and
then
warmth
and
light
came
back
to
the
rose
leaves
i
am
there
they
are
here
never
could
i
do
this
or
feel
this
until
now
or
i
did
it
so
weakly
and
palely
that
it
did
not
seem
to
count
the
sermon
ended
let
us
pray
let
us
sing
benediction
followed
then
a
moment
pause
and
then
the
folk
turned
from
the
pews
and
moved
slowly
toward
the
doors
there
were
greetings
for
sweet
rocket
and
sweet
rocket
greeted
in
return
all
had
a
grace
of
friendliness
anna
darcy
thought
that
is
another
thing
that
has
come
or
is
coming
what
does
it
matter
now
if
your
name
is
or
is
not
on
the
register
of
a
church
it
did
use
to
be
so
something
gracious
and
understanding
invisibly
binding
is
coming
she
thought
those
two
are
the
most
beautiful
here
but
in
their
degree
all
are
beautiful
and
all
move
on
to
completer
beauty
oh
life
is
coming
alive
they
drove
through
alder
and
by
alder
highway
and
at
last
upon
that
lovely
forest
road
to
sweet
rocket
curtin
and
linden
fell
to
talk
of
their
student
days
of
such
and
such
teachers
and
mates
and
such
and
such
happenings
i
had
forgotten
that
said
curtin
and
again
i
had
forgotten
that
at
last
he
said
abruptly
you
got
an
astounding
memory
linden
answered
oh
we
learn
how
to
use
and
deepen
memory
the
smell
of
the
forest
the
voice
of
the
forest
circled
and
penetrated
i
should
like
to
know
how
you
do
it
said
curtin
it
is
like
all
other
things
practice
makes
perfect
it
is
not
only
remembering
you
remember
with
a
strange
understanding
of
things
you
direct
later
light
upon
the
past
the
line
is
there
the
form
is
there
even
the
color
and
tone
but
you
make
it
understood
as
i
am
very
certain
we
did
not
understand
it
then
i
see
now
what
we
were
doing
it
intelligent
at
last
and
bigger
all
that
you
have
said
linden
is
too
much
to
apply
to
the
past
the
past
has
served
you
now
serve
the
past
serve
and
redeem
bring
it
up
even
and
great
into
the
present
to
understand
past
time
is
to
have
present
power
only
by
understanding
it
can
you
love
it
unless
you
wish
to
remain
infant
and
love
with
infant
love
the
woods
went
on
the
leafy
narrow
remote
road
the
scents
and
sounds
the
miracle
of
many
centered
into
sole
delight
the
air
was
so
fine
you
could
gather
what
the
upper
air
must
be
daniel
and
bess
the
phaeton
the
four
stepped
and
rolled
through
a
magic
world
artist
world
of
the
ancient
of
days
here
was
the
river
and
the
flashing
water
of
the
ford
that
afternoon
they
walked
upstream
as
far
as
the
overseer
house
it
was
shining
late
afternoon
they
saw
seated
on
the
porch
and
the
porch
steps
roger
carter
and
his
wife
with
guy
her
brother
who
worked
on
the
farm
and
old
and
morrowcombe
her
parents
paying
their
sunday
visit
a
little
roger
three
years
old
played
absorbedly
with
a
chinquapin
string
and
a
rag
doll
that
his
grandmother
had
brought
him
let
us
go
across
to
them
said
marget
just
so
did
my
father
and
mother
use
to
sit
carters
and
morrowcombes
made
them
welcome
linden
and
curtin
sat
upon
the
porch
steps
tam
beside
them
miss
darcy
now
played
with
the
young
roger
and
now
listened
to
morrowcombe
gentle
flowing
talk
of
turkeys
and
rag
carpets
and
sam
come
home
from
the
war
mary
carter
had
dark
eyes
and
wavy
hair
bright
color
in
a
round
cheek
a
shy
and
tender
smile
a
murillo
face
she
sat
holding
a
babe
and
she
talked
shyly
and
listened
with
intent
eyes
there
listened
too
old
morrowcombe
with
a
long
white
beard
and
a
gnarled
hand
resting
on
a
stick
marvelously
carved
by
himself
in
prison
long
ago
in
the
old
war
roger
carter
proved
a
quick
dry
talker
with
not
a
little
wit
and
power
of
mimicry
he
had
a
way
of
throwing
what
he
saw
and
heard
and
concluded
into
a
homely
story
both
telling
and
amusing
he
seemed
to
love
to
make
linden
and
marget
laugh
and
they
loved
to
draw
him
out
curtin
saw
with
what
skill
they
opened
fields
to
him
where
he
might
rejoice
in
his
talent
he
saw
how
they
understood
fellowship
presently
marget
asked
mary
if
she
might
take
miss
darcy
into
the
house
and
out
on
the
back
porch
and
to
the
lilac
hedge
certainly
miss
marget
you
go
right
in
it
all
straight
go
upstairs
too
anywhere
you
like
the
two
went
this
was
mother
room
here
i
was
born
when
i
was
a
little
girl
i
slept
in
this
tiny
room
next
door
the
rain
on
the
roof
drummed
me
to
sleep
this
was
the
boys
room
this
is
the
back
porch
where
we
did
much
of
the
work
it
is
so
lovely
and
broad
there
is
the
old
well
yonder
is
the
lilac
clump
where
once
in
may
i
saw
the
spirit
of
the
lilac
when
half
an
hour
later
they
walked
homeward
along
the
river
bank
there
renewed
itself
the
question
of
prolonging
a
visit
well
going
to
stay
anyhow
declared
curtin
i
like
it
better
here
than
at
that
camp
if
you
will
keep
me
a
month
oh
we
will
anna
darcy
said
i
ca
stay
that
long
but
i
stay
just
as
long
as
i
can
that
matter
settled
they
walked
on
quietly
in
the
amber
and
violet
hour
there
was
a
sound
of
water
a
smell
of
wood
smoke
the
house
rose
before
them
richly
colored
in
the
sunset
viii
the
weather
changed
on
the
heel
of
soft
sunshine
and
quietude
came
autumn
storm
wind
and
rain
lashed
trees
leaden
and
heavily
sagging
cloud
in
the
late
afternoon
zinia
appeared
at
the
parlor
door
miss
marget
there
are
two
men
on
horseback
they
come
over
rock
mountain
and
missed
their
way
they
say
it
getting
late
and
they
say
could
we
take
them
in
for
the
night
i
go
see
said
linden
and
left
the
room
of
course
you
will
yes
of
course
answered
marget
i
had
better
go
see
about
the
room
curtin
and
miss
darcy
left
alone
watched
the
flame
at
last
curtin
said
abruptly
had
you
ever
thought
of
humanity
moving
on
into
superhumanity
i
think
that
i
have
been
blind
and
deaf
to
a
great
many
things
i
suppose
i
thought
that
there
would
be
slow
general
improvement
but
i
did
not
think
of
marked
betterment
here
i
thought
of
the
soul
at
death
springing
alive
into
heaven
or
hell
yes
we
were
taught
that
and
it
was
going
to
reach
heaven
or
hell
at
one
stride
no
degree
here
no
degree
there
it
was
irrational
naturally
being
yet
in
time
there
are
those
ahead
some
cross
the
line
earlier
than
others
marget
returned
they
are
two
young
men
foresters
i
think
from
the
government
purchase
on
rock
mountain
they
are
wet
through
mancy
has
built
them
a
fire
and
richard
is
looking
after
them
she
stood
by
the
window
the
gray
rain
is
chanting
up
and
down
the
mountains
queen
rain
and
king
wind
curtin
put
a
chair
for
her
as
she
came
to
the
hearth
she
sat
down
and
bending
herself
looked
into
the
fire
she
held
her
hands
to
the
flame
and
appeared
to
gather
it
into
them
the
fire
said
marget
the
spirit
that
is
fire
that
is
will
that
are
living
endless
powers
the
host
of
the
lord
there
fell
a
silence
that
was
voice
then
said
anna
darcy
i
have
always
said
remember
i
remember
but
since
i
came
to
sweet
rocket
i
have
learned
far
and
away
more
of
how
to
remember
marget
turned
toward
her
with
a
great
sweetness
when
we
have
found
a
good
thing
we
so
naturally
wish
to
share
it
now
you
must
learn
the
universal
man
present
sharing
and
his
future
sharing
you
who
have
always
said
remember
and
who
have
been
unselfish
will
have
little
trouble
her
look
included
curtin
who
sat
staring
into
the
fire
he
drew
a
long
breath
two
weeks
ago
i
should
have
said
that
adventure
and
youth
had
passed
from
my
life
you
are
just
beginning
to
find
them
henceforth
you
will
find
rest
and
romance
salt
in
life
and
the
true
wine
and
the
uncloying
honey
and
the
bread
of
right
wheat
you
will
find
water
of
moses
spring
and
the
burning
bush
the
rain
and
the
wind
sang
against
the
pane
the
fire
made
shape
upon
shape
the
high
inward
vibration
lowered
but
it
left
a
memory
of
itself
there
was
the
jericho
rose
in
the
sandal
box
to
say
when
there
comes
moisture
again
to
my
root
then
shall
i
bloom
again
linden
entered
the
parlor
with
the
two
guests
now
with
dried
clothing
rested
and
refreshed
it
was
growing
dusk
the
room
looked
warm
and
bright
to
them
a
happy
haven
after
a
battering
day
they
were
young
men
forestry
graduates
resuming
forestry
after
an
interlude
of
war
linden
presented
them
randall
mr
drew
the
evening
closed
in
stormy
they
had
supper
a
small
bright
feast
with
talk
and
laughter
randall
proved
lively
good
company
drew
was
much
the
quieter
of
the
two
supper
over
they
returned
to
the
big
parlor
and
the
generous
fire
the
boy
jim
had
brought
in
a
great
armful
of
wood
it
was
a
night
to
heap
logs
as
the
rain
drummed
against
the
pane
randall
was
talkative
he
flowed
like
a
mountain
stream
trilled
like
a
bird
forests
and
forestry
came
into
the
room
it
appeared
that
both
had
had
from
childhood
a
taste
not
to
say
a
passion
for
woodland
life
randall
had
lived
in
the
country
so
it
came
natural
but
drew
had
lived
in
a
city
but
forests
were
a
passion
with
him
he
had
to
get
into
them
and
did
so
at
every
chance
and
at
last
left
for
good
a
clerkship
in
a
stockbroker
office
and
scraped
together
enough
for
that
course
in
a
forestry
school
this
gave
him
surface
learning
but
he
exhibited
a
deeper
knowingness
gained
somewhere
drew
like
an
indian
in
the
woods
no
not
like
an
indian
said
drew
linden
asked
like
whom
then
he
sat
in
a
corner
of
the
great
fireplace
tam
who
came
indoors
upon
nights
like
these
lying
at
his
feet
drew
said
randall
tell
them
about
that
night
in
france
he
got
a
curious
story
he
wo
tell
it
to
everybody
but
i
do
know
somehow
we
all
at
home
here
his
quick
song
went
on
you
see
my
folk
and
drew
are
english
we
just
a
generation
from
fields
and
things
that
we
heard
about
all
our
lives
so
when
england
went
in
we
thought
we
better
go
over
and
we
did
we
were
in
the
same
company
and
this
was
before
verdun
go
on
now
drew
drew
began
at
once
without
prelude
his
eyes
upon
the
blind
man
it
was
something
that
happened
to
me
sometimes
i
think
that
it
was
a
dream
and
then
i
know
that
it
was
i
more
and
more
certain
as
time
goes
on
that
it
was
i
got
a
kind
of
feeling
about
reality
that
we
are
like
swallows
skimming
it
i
suppose
that
now
and
then
a
swallow
tumbles
into
it
well
it
was
a
big
dark
wood
fairly
early
in
the
war
a
detachment
sent
we
did
not
know
by
whom
nor
for
what
moved
through
it
from
one
station
to
another
i
was
second
lieutenant
well
there
came
news
of
a
trap
and
most
of
us
turned
off
in
a
hurry
out
of
that
wood
but
i
do
to
this
day
know
how
it
was
as
many
as
twenty
were
away
from
the
rest
sent
to
find
out
something
somewhere
it
was
night
and
there
was
no
path
we
got
the
warning
too
and
we
swung
round
and
tried
to
get
back
to
the
main
body
there
came
a
spattering
of
shot
there
were
men
besides
ourselves
in
that
wood
they
rose
like
partridges
and
struck
like
hawks
we
struck
back
there
was
fighting
something
came
down
on
my
head
like
a
falling
tree
i
remember
that
i
thought
it
was
a
falling
tree
then
everything
went
black
and
it
seemed
both
a
long
time
and
a
short
time
till
dawn
it
came
at
last
dawn
i
sat
up
and
it
had
been
a
falling
tree
my
forehead
had
an
aching
lump
and
a
gash
but
luckily
just
a
branch
had
struck
me
and
i
had
rolled
clear
it
was
a
very
old
oak
brought
down
by
the
high
wind
upon
the
branch
beside
me
was
growing
mistletoe
i
would
touch
it
for
i
thought
is
not
for
me
to
touch
it
but
surely
it
saved
my
life
there
was
gray
light
and
one
red
streak
far
down
the
forest
where
after
a
time
would
be
the
sun
and
then
i
remembered
that
it
was
lutwyn
who
had
saved
my
life
crying
out
and
pushing
me
away
where
i
had
thrown
myself
down
for
one
moment
rest
i
looked
beyond
the
mistletoe
and
i
saw
that
the
tree
had
caught
and
pinned
down
a
man
i
crept
on
hands
and
knees
for
i
was
dizzy
yet
and
i
found
lutwyn
he
lay
pale
and
twitching
his
leg
and
part
of
his
body
under
the
trunk
of
the
oak
it
was
very
still
and
lonely
in
the
forest
and
the
first
cold
light
made
me
shiver
and
i
was
afraid
of
the
mistletoe
so
near
i
got
lutwyn
from
under
the
tree
and
it
took
all
my
strength
to
do
it
the
spring
that
we
called
red
deer
was
hardly
a
spear
throw
away
i
had
on
a
cap
of
otter
skin
and
i
filled
this
with
water
and
brought
it
back
to
lutwyn
when
i
had
dashed
it
over
his
face
and
put
it
between
his
lips
he
sighed
and
came
to
himself
opening
his
eyes
and
trying
to
sit
up
he
said
thought
it
would
catch
you
and
i
tried
to
thrust
you
out
of
its
way
i
said
you
badly
hurt
can
you
walk
he
tried
but
he
could
only
drag
himself
a
little
way
holding
by
a
branch
of
the
tree
the
light
had
grown
stronger
the
red
line
down
the
forest
was
a
red
splash
we
were
both
thinking
of
guthlac
and
his
men
who
were
after
us
because
being
outlaws
we
had
set
upon
and
stopped
a
bullock
wagon
and
helped
ourselves
we
had
strong
belief
that
when
they
found
us
they
would
hang
us
we
had
no
great
start
of
them
lutwyn
said
go
on
oswy
i
make
myself
at
home
here
by
the
mistletoe
that
could
be
i
could
carry
him
he
was
if
anything
a
little
taller
and
larger
than
i
he
tried
again
to
move
but
it
was
not
his
leg
alone
his
body
had
been
hurt
terribly
hurt
i
now
saw
he
could
not
make
a
step
it
was
i
who
drew
him
back
to
the
tree
he
settled
down
into
the
hollow
made
by
the
trunk
and
a
bough
and
i
looked
at
his
hurts
but
could
do
little
for
them
i
saw
that
they
were
filled
with
danger
the
mistletoe
grew
so
near
him
i
looked
at
it
and
i
wished
it
would
heal
lutwyn
said
you
go
on
oswy
i
do
want
you
to
be
hanged
i
said
your
breath
and
sat
down
beside
him
we
rested
side
by
side
against
the
tree
and
he
said
that
he
was
not
in
pain
but
only
now
and
then
drowsy
he
was
very
clear
in
his
mind
and
wanted
to
talk
i
listened
for
guthlac
and
his
men
and
looked
at
the
mistletoe
the
sun
was
up
now
and
it
was
growing
gold
the
mistletoe
a
great
bunch
of
it
i
did
not
hear
guthlac
it
was
likely
to
be
some
time
before
they
found
us
having
to
wait
till
day
to
see
our
track
now
and
then
i
felt
guthlac
rope
around
my
neck
and
then
i
looked
at
the
mistletoe
and
it
seemed
to
be
growing
by
woden
chair
then
lutwyn
came
awake
again
and
we
talked
we
were
twin
brothers
we
talked
of
when
we
were
boys
and
of
our
mother
and
lutwyn
the
strong
our
father
and
of
places
we
had
seen
and
the
earth
we
had
trod
the
earth
that
was
us
we
thought
springing
up
in
us
all
toward
father
sun
and
all
the
wrong
that
we
had
done
went
away
and
the
mistletoe
grew
more
golden
he
drowsed
away
for
longer
and
longer
times
far
away
i
heard
guthlac
horn
it
blew
and
another
answered
they
had
found
our
track
and
were
drawing
together
lutwyn
waked
and
heard
it
too
there
another
horn
for
me
he
said
you
hear
that
one
he
had
slipped
from
the
hollow
of
the
oak
and
his
head
was
on
my
knee
the
horn
blew
louder
and
nearer
the
mistletoe
was
all
golden
i
could
feel
guthlac
rope
around
my
neck
but
i
was
glad
they
would
not
hang
lutwyn
he
was
dead
the
horn
blew
louder
in
the
wood
i
heard
them
shouting
the
mistletoe
was
burning
gold
i
said
woden
we
be
brothers
lutwyn
and
me
they
broke
upon
us
shouting
and
all
went
black
drew
stopped
speaking
he
sat
bent
over
looking
at
the
fire
putting
down
a
hand
he
stroked
tam
straightening
himself
he
looked
at
linden
and
marget
all
that
was
actual
he
said
just
as
actual
just
as
real
just
as
day
and
night
and
earthly
and
conscious
as
this
room
and
the
fire
and
we
six
and
the
dog
he
made
a
movement
toward
randall
you
tell
the
rest
randall
voice
came
in
the
detachment
drove
the
germans
out
of
the
wood
and
chased
them
a
good
long
way
it
was
dawn
when
we
stopped
and
went
back
to
gather
up
our
hurt
and
dead
there
were
a
dozen
dead
germans
and
us
and
a
good
many
hurt
all
scattered
through
that
wood
that
was
full
of
big
trees
we
found
drew
propped
against
a
very
great
old
fallen
tree
he
had
been
struck
over
the
head
in
the
fighting
and
had
a
cut
or
two
besides
nothing
odd
in
that
but
what
was
odd
was
that
he
was
cherishing
a
dead
german
had
his
head
lying
on
his
knee
of
course
enemies
lying
as
close
as
lovers
was
any
novelty
but
drew
had
crept
some
little
way
to
this
man
and
had
tried
to
stop
his
bleeding
all
there
in
the
dark
and
had
given
him
water
and
then
had
gathered
him
into
his
arms
he
said
he
was
drew
but
he
was
one
oswy
too
yes
that
was
a
german
but
it
was
lutwyn
too
he
said
they
were
twin
brothers
we
were
used
to
men
out
of
their
heads
so
we
gathered
him
up
and
took
him
on
he
wanted
us
to
stop
and
bury
the
german
but
there
was
time
for
that
the
funny
thing
is
that
he
certainly
is
out
of
his
head
now
yet
he
still
believes
that
story
though
he
wo
tell
it
to
every
one
the
rain
beat
the
fire
burned
i
tried
to
get
back
said
drew
back
to
guthlac
and
the
bullock
wagon
and
why
we
were
outlaws
if
i
could
find
even
now
what
we
did
if
i
could
get
farther
back
still
to
the
point
where
we
decided
to
do
it
and
redecide
decide
more
wisely
having
long
light
upon
it
i
think
that
even
now
i
could
change
in
some
way
the
whole
world
changing
it
to
lutwyn
and
me
would
mean
changing
the
whole
texture
you
are
right
said
linden
and
seeing
it
that
way
you
have
begun
to
put
your
change
into
operation
the
fire
shined
the
rain
beat
upon
the
panes
the
wind
came
with
the
impact
of
sea
in
storm
pictures
shifted
before
the
inner
eye
lands
and
times
held
the
earth
now
they
seemed
foreign
pictures
now
there
was
a
faintly
conscious
participation
we
are
earth
said
linden
all
these
are
in
our
memory
earth
is
growing
conscious
a
conscious
spirit
that
is
what
we
mean
when
we
say
is
a
new
world
just
beneath
the
horizon
ix
in
the
night
the
storm
ceased
the
household
woke
to
a
high
clear
stirring
morning
the
clouds
riding
in
archipelagoes
with
between
isles
a
sea
bluer
than
the
ægean
the
shaken
trees
had
spread
a
persian
carpet
all
the
flowers
hung
heavy
with
wet
snails
marched
on
the
paths
sweet
rocket

mimy
house
rose
beside
the
orchard
a
pretty
cottage
with
a
dooryard
filled
with
cockscomb
and
larkspur
and
marigold
at
the
gate
grew
a
bush
of
myrrh
and
the
porch
had
over
it
a
gourd
vine
just
so
sat
in
the
middle
of
the
path
playing
with
red
and
blue
blocks
at
the
sound
of
voices
susan
appeared
a
neat
and
active
woman
just
so
do
you
clutter
up
the
path
like
that
come
miss
marget
she
took
them
across
the
porch
where
the
gourd
vine
made
so
pleasant
a
pattern
into
a
little
parlor
bright
as
a
pin
they
sat
and
talked
and
then
susan
said
that
she
would
bring
julia
and
leaving
the
room
reappeared
pushing
a
wheeled
chair
in
this
sat
julia
who
was
almost
a
woman
and
had
a
slender
pleasing
face
and
was
only
a
little
lame
in
her
mind
marget
emptied
the
basket
oh
my
said
julia
and
again
oh
my
with
eager
fingers
she
spread
the
bits
of
silk
and
velvet
and
satin
and
striped
or
flowered
ribbon
pieces
it
will
be
a
quilt
i
make
a
quilt
like
they

in
heaven
shoo
julia
exclaimed
susan
they
do
have
quilts
in
heaven
it
ai
cold
there
julia
face
took
on
an
imploring
almost
a
frightened
look
she
turned
to
marget
if
they
do
have
quilts
i
wo
have
anything
to
do
with
all
that
she
knew
of
marget
land
miss
darcy
could
but
wonder
at
the
luminous
sweetness
the
depth
and
the
play
with
which
marget
seated
by
julia
dealt
with
the
latter
fears
all
the
bright
pieces
were
spread
over
the
knees
of
both
in
heaven
you
put
rose
and
blue
together
and

violet
and
green
and

flowered
pieces

for
warmth
and
beauty

are
they
shut
your
eyes
and
see
warmth
and
beauty
warmth
and
beauty
she
put
her
hand
over
the
lame
woman
hand
the
latter
plaintive
look
changed
her
eyes
brightened
and
she
nodded
her
head
yes
to
keep
us
warm
and
they
are
lovely
like
the
flowers
warm
like
the
sun

yes
warmth
and
beauty
warmth
and
beauty
so
in
heaven

to
keep
on
with
warmth
and
beauty
and
you
learn
too
how
well
wisdom
goes
with
them
their
quilts
are
just
like
these
quilts
but
you
care
for
that
you
be
putting
together
and
giving
beautiful
bright
things
julia
caressed
a
length
of
flowered
ribbon
that
what
i
think
they
warm
and
beautiful
warm
and
beautiful
and
every
one

give
a
quilt
to

glad

one
when

that
piece
in
think
and
beautiful
for
gray
she
gave
it
to
you
and
miss
lucy
allen
gave
the
beautiful
blue
piece
when
they
had
quitted
the
porch
with
the
gourd
vine
and
the
dooryard
and
the
gate
by
the
myrrh
bush
and
were
under
the
orchard
trees
marget
said
she
been
making
quilts
for
twenty
years
perhaps
two
a
year
and
into
each
one
goes
i
do
not
know
what
dim
thinking
and
feeling
warmth
and
beauty
for
such
and
such
a
one
it
was
miss
darcy
habit
to
rest
a
little
in
her
own
room
after
dinner
in
the
midafternoon
coming
downstairs
she
found
the
door
of
study
open
linden
turned
his
head
hearing
her
step
come
in
here
are
marget
and
curtin
it
was
the
first
time
she
had
entered
this
room
her
eyes
took
it
in
as
she
crossed
the
threshold
and
found
it
a
simple
grave
place
as
simple
and
grave
and
charged
with
its
own
aroma
and
spirit
as
a
pine
wood
it
spread
a
large
room
with
plenty
of
space
for
pacing
up
and
down
the
bookcases
the
desk
the
chairs
an
old
long
cane
and
wood
sofa
were
for
use
the
plain
walls
held
a
few
prints
in
one
of
the
deep
windows
stood
a
large
globe
curtin
put
miss
darcy
a
chair
i
just
come
in
he
said
there
had
grown
between
them
beginning
the
morning
upon
which
she
found
him
fishing
or
not
fishing
in
the
gorge
that
closed
the
valley
a
quiet
liking
and
friendship
with
a
sense
perhaps
of
standing
even
in
the
inner
world
linden
was
saying
marget
sat
before
the
desk
not
far
from
the
fireplace
in
which
burned
a
light
flame
she
had
been
writing
and
linden
dictating
from
his
big
cane
chair
by
the
long
window
she
had
turned
from
the
desk
and
he
had
moved
his
chair
to
where
he
sat
half
in
firelight
half
in
tawny
sunlight
to
anna
darcy
sense
the
room
had
strongly
that
luminousness
which
in
some
sort
she
found
in
the
whole
of
sweet
rocket
in
valleys
hills
house
and
folk
the
whole
made
a
cluster
that
acting
as
a
cluster
redoubled
so
all
effects
but
undoubtedly
linden
and
marget
were
the
center
of
the
cluster
i
am
glad
you
have
come
in
said
curtin
linden
was
speaking
of
their
life
here
i
told
you
you
remember
driving
through
the
woods
of
our
outer
life
marget
said
sitting
here
before
the
fire
we
had
begun
to
talk
of
that
far
larger
life
within
the
outer
linden
spoke
martin
asked
me
and
i
was
telling
him
as
clearly
as
i
could
it
is
not
wholly
clear
you
must
not
think
to
marget
and
me
our
progression
and
our
life
is
a
bridge
says
nietzsche
a
living
bridge
that
crosses
from
himself
to
himself
always
the
provisional
the
halfway
gone
afar
even
while
we
say
am
i
how
to
name
a
thing
that
travels
so
fast
the
life
of
marget
and
me
changes
and
grows
as
does
yours
and
yours
the
history
of
one
the
history
of
all
there
is
at
once
divine
difference
divine
sameness
no
hand
and
no
word
will
hold
our
life
i
do
know
anyone
like
you
said
curtin
no
but
you
will
presently
begin
to
know
more
and
more
who
differ
from
us
and
yet
who
belong
in
the
order
the
order
of
those
who
are
aware
that
present
man
is
a
bridge
and
who
begin
consciously
to
act
feel
and
know
in
a
larger
existence
and
that
is
still
inward
the
world
still
calls
it
inward
to
those
in
that
existence
inward
and
outward
past
present
and
future
come
into
one
the
old
words
then
are
but
retained
words
of
convenience
as
to
the
ultimate
mind
martin
and
richard
marget
anna
are
but
words
of
convenience
names
for
strands
of
experience
all
are
comprehended
combined
surpassed
the
sun
lighted
his
hair
his
bronzed
face
his
quiet
eyes
the
sight
of
which
he
seemed
so
little
to
miss
after
a
moment
pause
he
spoke
on
many
and
many
are
aware
of
the
richness
of
destiny
some
more
so
some
less
so
but
aware
faculties
that
in
a
host
are
but
germinal
build
in
and
for
others
realities
the
momentary
superficial
present
not
being
the
true
present
there
not
have
been
since
the
dawn
of
history
many
such
men
and
women
very
many
a
host
there
are
many
there
will
be
more
if
you
regard
with
intentness
you
may
see
the
new
humanity
forming
what
of
those
who
neither
dream
nor
divine
nor
wish
who
come
on
so
slow
their
not
divining
nor
dreaming
nor
wishing
is
more
apparent
than
real
all
come
on
the
slowest
who
thinks
he
has
no
direction
is
drawn
unconscious
until
the
day
when
he
discovers
the
compass
will
any
never
cross
i
do
think
so
and
when
the
last
human
being
has
crossed
then
will
the
others
come
on
into
humanity
they
that
we
call
the
animals
and
those
behind
them
will
lift
to
where
they
were
but
our
wave
goes
on
into
the
spiritual
world
that
is
the
world
of
subtler
matter
vaster
energy
understanding
at
last
love
at
last
beauty
at
last
well
marget
and
i
are
conscious
travelers
thitherward
as
are
you
and
you
ah
you
are
ahead
of
me
and
of
me
in
some
ways
we
may
be
ahead
and
in
others
you
may
have
store
of
energy
and
experience
that
sets
you
ahead
that
matters
not
in
the
least
whitman
said
that
when
he
said
by
my
side
or
back
of
me
eve
following
or
in
front
and
i
following
her
just
the
same
like
him
too
content
with
the
present
and
content
with
the
past
yet
lassoing
the
past
and
the
present
with
the
future
curtin
shook
his
head
you
have
powers
that
are
not
mine
if
we
have
them
they
will
be
yours
marget
and
i
think
that
we
have
as
it
were
a
blueprint
but
not
yet
do
we
walk
in
the
full
and
great
temple
we
do
faintly
and
weakly
what
one
day
we
shall
do
with
all
vigor
and
many
things
that
we
do
not
yet
dream
we
shall
do
and
you
also
you
and
anna
when
you
begin
to
feel
continuity
when
no
matter
where
you
move
you
take
possession
of
yourself
he
rose
from
his
chair
and
standing
before
them
put
a
hand
upon
curtin

the
sun

through
the
western
window

and
stirring

a
low
singing
x
the
next
day
drew
came
back
curtin
seated
on
the
porch
saw
him
cross
the
river
and
ride
up
by
the
cedars
shutting
his
book
he
descended
the
steps
to
meet
him
good
day
drew
glad
to
see
you
back
nothing
wrong
drew
dismounted
no
i
wanted
to
talk
to
mr
linden
jim
coming
around
the
house
took
the
horse
he
out
somewhere
on
the
place
said
curtin
miss
land
too
but
they
will
be
back
by
twelve
did
you
ride
from
rock
mountain
this
morning
yes
it
not
so
far
once
you
know
the
way
he
took
the
chair
that
curtin
hospitably
pushed
forward
and
sat
apparently
in
a
brown
study
while
the
other
speculated
at
last
said
drew
this
is
a
good
big
farm
with
room
i
should
be
surprised
for
another
worker
at
any
rate
i
ridden
over
to
ask
linden
to
employ
me
do
you
like
farming
better
than
forestry
i
like
it
better
plus
some
other
things
his
eyes
swept
the
hills
that
shut
in
the
vale
there
is
rich
forest
here
any
woodland
that
he
has
i
could
cut
and
replant
i
know
something
of
farming
too
and
i
can
learn
more
i
give
good
work
in
return
for
the
other
things
that
they
can
teach
me
and
that
i
want
he
regarded
curtin
with
brooding
eyes
ever
since
i
could
remember
i
have
been
beset
by
the
past
a
man
told
me
once
that
i
was
conscious
there
but
had
it
with
the
present
and
the
future
it
was
some
time
ago
and
he
went
away
at
once
and
i
never
found
his
like
again
until
i
came
here
i
do
think
there
are
many
of
them
living
at
any
one
time
the
only
wisdom
i
got
is
the
wisdom
of
going
where
i
think
i
may
find
help
how
about
randall
i
very
fond
of
randall
but
he
ca
help
me
here
nor
i
him
he
thinks
it
just
my
there
a
man
in
washington
who
will
be
mighty
glad
to
get
my
job
he
a
friend
too
of
randall
i
want
to
stay
here
for
a
year
then
i
may
go
foresting
again
with
randall
i
do
want
to
lose
him
if
linden
ca
use
another
man
this
winter
perhaps
he
will
take
me
in
the
spring
in
that
case
i
go
and
come
again
i
talked
it
all
out
with
malcolm
smith
our
chief
at
rock
mountain
brown
in
washington
will
come
down
right
away
at
twelve
appeared
linden
he
stood
in
the
hall
door
is
it
you
drew
i
will
be
down
in
a
moment
to
shake
hands
they
heard
his
step
going
up
to
his
room
blind
and
not
blind
said
curtin
there
some
profound
development
of
sensibility
i
am
not
a
scholar
said
drew
i
have
got
the
names
to
give
to
things
that
a
part
of
my
need
marget
and
miss
darcy
came
up
from
the
river
path
they
had
been
it
seemed
to
the
overseer
house
marget
gave
her
hand
to
drew
i
am
glad
to
see
you
again
there
was
no
surprise
in
her
warm
and
happy
voice
your
room
is
all
ready
for
you
they
had
dinner
when
it
was
over
drew
went
with
linden
into
his
study
the
three
others
lingered
a
little
in
the
pleasant
wide
hall
the
day
was
again
right
october
amber
and
garnet
and
sapphire
balm
with
nothing
of
lethargy
said
curtin
when
we
come
and
come
what
do
you
do
at
last
marget
laughed
oh
you
come
and
go
you
never
really
go
you
know
but
you
have
to
take
your
bodies
here
and
there
over
earth
but
once
come
we
keep
you
and
you
keep
us
you
know
people
all
over
the
earth
yes
do
they
write
oh
now
one
and
now
another
writes
but
we
hardly
need
letters
that
is
they
are
needed
of
course
for
minute
information
for
news
of
bodily
movement
but
there
is
communion
whether
we
write
or
not
marget
returned
to
the
dining
room
to
talk
with
zinia
anna
darcy
went
up
to
her
chamber
for
her
rest
and
curtin
took
his
book
to
the
porch
the
books
at
sweet
rocket
he
fell
to
pondering
them
there
were
perhaps
five
thousand
not
in
one
room
but
up
and
down
many
were
old
and
many
neither
old
nor
new
and
many
new
they
seemed
to
touch
all
subjects
curtin
pondering
going
deeper
and
deeper
fell
into
some
border
country
of
reality
with
swiftness
with
electric
shock
he
touched
not
thousands
of
leaves
of
paper
printed
over
but
conscious
intelligent
and
powerful
life
or
rather
it
seemed
to
touch
to
descend
upon
him
to
well
through
him
coming
down
coming
from
within
occupying
space
internal
to
all
this
tranquil
outer
october
space
it
was
presence
it
was
personality
overwhelming
books
what
were
true
books
will
desire
intelligence
living
active
not
unclothed
or
unbodied
living
presence
present
activity
being
in
mass
active
being
present
and
active
here
in
this
valley
and
present
and
active
elsewhere
present
and
active
throughout
he
knew
not
what
infinity
he
felt
again
that
wide
and
deep
shock
of
reality
the
world
lived
had
always
lived
only
he
had
not
known
it
vigor
streamed
into
vein
and
nerve
he
sprang
to
his
feet
and
leaving
the
porch
moved
down
past
the
cedars
to
the
river
path
and
along
it
it
is
not
richard
linden
and
marget
land
nor
the
one
nor
the
other
it
is
all
of
us
it
is
the
whole
the
whole
has
found
them
and
is
bringing
them
in
accord
he
felt
exquisitely
a
touch
of
bliss
it
will
bring
me
in
accord
too
drew
and
miss
darcy
and
me
and
many
others
he
felt
a
satisfaction
such
as
he
had
never
dreamed
all
others
one
by
one
all
accorded
all
remembered
the
already
remembered
forever
increasing
in
strength
gathering
drawing
the
scattered
and
fragmentary
and
incipient
he
walked
hardly
knowing
that
he
walked
goodness
and
largeness
the
dawn
of
them
is
synchronous
with
the
dawn
of
allness
all
our
words
mercy
justice
love
wisdom
power
joy
are
but
terms
for
the
natural
habitual
feeling
of
the
one
who
is
whole
it
is
not
that
they
are
they
are
the
hue
and
tone
and
sense
of
health
he
went
up
the
river
as
far
as
the
overseer
house
here
upon
the
bench
built
around
the
sycamore
he
found
old
morrowcombe
who
had
stayed
over
with
the
carters
in
his
old
brown
clothes
with
hair
and
long
beard
pale
as
the
pale
patches
of
the
sycamore
trunk
and
boughs
leaning
forward
upon
his
stick
he
looked
as
it
were
the
huge
old
tree
come
forth
into
human
form
curtin
sat
down
beside
this
old
man
the
cane
upon
which
the
elder
leaned
was
now
close
to
his
eye
and
he
saw
that
it
was
covered
with
finely
cut
words
thick
and
shaped
like
a
shepherd
crook
the
graving
ran
all
over
it
may
i
look
surely
said
morrowcombe
and
gave
it
into
his
hand
the
year
i
was
in
prison
at
camp
chase
i
carved
around
it
the
psalm
curtin
examined
the
quite
beautifully
done
work
trust
and
consolation
in
your
hand
walking
with
them
for
fifty
years
he
sat
musing
morrowcombe
old
gentle
voice
began
like
the
zephyr
in
the
sycamore
whose
beginning
you
could
hardly
guess
yes
sir
that
staff
me
now
just
as
a
good
dog
that
goes
with
you
gets
to
be
you
it
helped
me
week
days
and
sundays
that
staff
i
made
myself
i
made
it
myself
and
i
did
make
it
i
did
make
the
tree
that
grew
it
and
i
did
make
the
psalm
nor
david
that
made
the
psalm
but
i
cut
the
staff
from
the
tree
and
i
carved
the
words
there
so
i
reckon
i
have
my
part
you
cut
it
in
prison
do
you
see
that
piece
just
thar
the
old
finger
traced
the
line
settest
me
a
table
in
the
presence
of
mine
i
cut
that
deep
and
fierce
he
looked
at
the
river
and
then
again
at
curtin
now
whatever
it
means
i
know
it
does
mean
what
then
i
wanted
it
to
mean
his
old
gentle
face
grew
meditative
contemplative
a
more
tranquil
form
and
face
it
would
have
been
hard
to
find
i
kind
of
sense
the
meaning
but
i
ca
put
it
into
words
but
when
you
feel
at
last
with
folks
and
things
you
ca
feel
against
them
when
i
was
young
i
must
have
hated
a
lot
of
folk
i
do
now
what
is
your
healing
herb
put
yourself
in
his
place
do
oust
him
from
the
place
but
understand
him
flow
into
him
deep
then
you
find
that
there
is
something
inside
or
above
you
and
him
which
understands
and
straightens
out
both
of
you
next
thing
you
find
is
that
you
have
got
any
real
controversy
do
you
call
that
something
god
that
what
i
call
it
i
used
to
think
that
you
to
call
it
god
i
do
now
but
it
a
mighty
good
word
we
hallowed
it
it
the
biggest
word
we
got
morrowcombe
when
we
join
god
do
you
think
we
shall
say
will
say
yes
they
sat
gazing
at
the
river
and
the
colored
hills
ai
this
a
lovely
place
said
morrowcombe
it
like
beulah
land
do
you
ever
talk
to
mr
linden
surely
him
and
marget
land
they
of
those
in
our
time
who
are
remembered
early
he
glided
into
one
of
his
gentle
silences
curtin
pondered
that
matter
of
said
morrowcombe
i
knew
marget
land
when
she
was
a
little
girl
and
came
to
sunday
school
she
was
baptized
in
our
church
but
she
ai
now
one
of
our
church
members
that
used
to
grieve
and
puzzle
me
make
me
a
little
angry
too
i
reckon
now
i
do
bother
about
it
she
in
the
living
church
all
right
he
looked
up
into
the
bronze
and
silver
sycamore
i
sat
on
this
bench
in
old
major
linden
time
when
john
land
was
overseer
and
lived
in
the
house
yonder
his
wife
elizabeth
was
just
the
salt
of
the
earth
those
children
used
to
be
playing
around
this
tree
i
remember
marget
a
little
thing
she
sat
by
me
often
on
this
bench
and
made
me
tell
her
stories
now
it
seems
a
long
time
ago
and
now
it
seems
yesterday
his
voice
sank
again
into
the
october
sunshiny
stillness
his
lips
closed
but
curtin
felt
him
speaking
on
in
thought
and
consciousness
it
came
to
him
in
another
of
those
revelational
flashings
that
is
the
of
speech
the
high
subtle
inaudible
continual
speech
when
we
begin
to
catch
it
when
we
begin
to
hear
thought
he
felt
again
the
shock
of
going
together
of
rivers
pouring
into
ocean
morrowcombe
lips
parted
the
war
turned
me
serious
and
i
found
religion
two
years
after
the
surrender
i
tell
her
bible
stories
i
had
a
kind
of
gift
roger
carter
that
my
nephew
as
well
as
my
has
got
the
same
gift
though
it
ai
always
bible
stories
that
he
tells
except
i
reckon
as
all
true
stories
are
bible
stories
i
used
to
tell
her
about
david
and
jonathan
and
joseph
and
his
brethren
and
ruth
and
naomi
and
mary
and
martha
and
lazarus
in
bethany
mary
and
martha
in
yourself
and
lazarus
who
was
long
dead
but
could
be
raised
and
christ
who
could
judge
and
portion
and
raise
all
in
yourself
she
used
to
listen
sitting
just
there
she
had
mind
then
and
she
got
mind
now
i
have
in
a
lot
of
ways
she
and
him
mind
and
goodness
and
spirit
that
is
power
and
a
body
that
you
love
to
look
at
they
the
kind
of
folk
that
ought
to
be
yes
sir
i
was
thinking
when
you
came
along
of
marget
sitting
there
a
little
thing
and
saying
tell
me
about
the
children
of
israel
or
bethlehem
as
it
might
be
with
distinctness
curtin
felt
that
which
the
old
man
also
seemed
to
feel
for
he
turned
his
head
lowering
it
and
his
eyes
a
little
and
smiling
the
movement
was
precisely
that
of
turning
and
smiling
into
a
child
eyes
again
through
curtin
poured
that
thrill
of
a
freshness
of
knowledge
if
this
tree
this
place
were
strongly
in
a
consciousness
in
a
memory
surely
then
that
conscious
spirit
itself
might
in
some
sort
be
felt
here
at
any
rate
he
was
aware
of
marget
though
to
all
outward
senses
appeared
only
the
october
air
he
had
again
the
sense
of
etheric
life
he
lost
it
it
was
so
bright
it
was
so
transient
the
unquenchable
desire
was
to
bring
it
lasting
he
presently
walked
back
to
sweet
rocket
house
drew
was
on
the
porch
i
going
to
stay
i
write
to
brown
and
ride
to
rock
mountain
to
tell
smith
and
randall
and
pack
up
my
things
xi
the
next
day
drew
returned
to
rock
mountain
to
make
his
arrangements
why
not
ride
with
him
linden
looked
at
curtin
there
is
a
fair
trail
you
have
an
extraordinarily
fine
view
from
the
top
drew
urged
it
likewise
but
i
have
a
horse
roger
carter
has
a
good
saddle
mare
he
will
be
glad
i
know
to
let
you
have
her
drew
mounted
as
he
came
curtin
on
dixie
set
out
before
noon
for
rock
mountain
the
cliffy
crest
that
gave
it
its
name
peered
above
the
southern
hills
and
ridges
facing
sweet
rocket
crossing
the
river
the
two
kept
for
some
little
distance
to
the
alder
road
then
at
a
pine
tree
left
it
for
a
just
discernible
track
this
is
where
we
changed
randall
and
i
the
other
day
until
we
saw
the
river
we
thought
that
we
were
going
to
alder
but
we
were
going
to
sweet
rocket
instead
the
trees
closing
in
behind
them
they
were
plunged
into
forest
there
was
now
no
green
save
the
green
of
occasional
pine
or
hemlock
all
was
gold
or
red
or
russet
moreover
the
earlier
trees
to
turn
were
fast
flinging
their
mantles
upon
the
earth
the
sky
met
less
obstruction
the
sunlight
spread
a
royal
carpet
the
air
equaled
exhilaration
as
curtin
rode
he
thought
that
he
faintly
remembered
all
the
forests
of
the
world
is
it
infectious
is
it
because
in
some
sort
drew
remembers
or
is
it
because
i
have
been
and
surely
i
been
in
all
the
forests
of
the
world
like
him
i
remember
best
the
temperate
and
the
northern
forests
because
in
time
they
are
the
nearer
for
a
while
they
rode
in
silence
there
was
only
the
sound
of
their
own
breathing
and
movement
and
the
very
inner
voice
of
the
forest
low
speech
of
branches
that
brushed
them
break
of
twigs
flutter
of
wings
tap
of
woodpeckers
whisk
of
squirrel
and
once
a
little
way
off
the
heavy
whir
of
a
pheasant
at
last
drew
broke
the
silence
my
mother
died
when
i
was
fifteen
years
old
and
my
father
when
i
was
twenty
i
remember
my
mother
mother
and
my
father
mother
and
father
i
know
a
good
deal
about
their
life
after
i
was
born
and
their
life
before
i
was
born
i
have
a
fair
notion
of
my
grandparents
parents
and
i
know
something
of
the
way
of
life
of
the
generation
behind
that
one
i
have
been
told
and
i
have
read
of
course
there
are
presently
ancestors
of
whom
i
have
been
told
nothing
and
behind
these
countless
others
of
course
i
know
that
people
often
imaginatively
share
the
experience
of
parents
and
kindred
they
say
must
have
been
so
and
so
with
my
mother
and
my
father
or
with
my
grandparents
or
my
ancestors
generally
they
had
these
experiences
and
they
must
have
felt
and
done
this
way
it
seems
almost
as
if
i
were
there
i
think
when
you
say
that
you
are
beginning
but
it
grown
to
be
more
than
that
with
me
after
all
what
are
you
but
your
parents
your
grandparents
your
and
so
on
your
experience
under
your
immediate
name
and
your
experience
under
your
old
names
their
names
and
alike
what
are
they
but
you
share
and
share
comprehend
and
comprehend
include
and
include
i
tell
you
that
i
am
aware
of
the
pyramid
behind
this
cleaving
point
that
is
talking
to
you
i
do
you
mean
that
you
remember
actually
thinking
feeling
doing
what
men
say
your
ancestors
did
i
do
get
it
clear
it
all
wrought
into
some
kind
of
unity
i
remember
clearly
sharp
isolated
experiences
except
that
one
time
i
told
you
about
and
that
was
clear
and
sharp
repetition
but
i
remember
all
the
same
i
do
feel
any
wall
between
my
father
and
myself
between
my
mother
and
myself
my
grandparents
and
myself
you
do
know
how
curiously
i
seem
to
share
their
life
sometimes
lying
still
at
night
i
simply
naturally
am
edward
drew
as
well
as
philip
drew
i
look
out
of
the
edward
drew
window
or
out
of
the
andrew
or
robert
or
margaret
or
janet
window
and
then
i
turn
and
look
out
of
the
philip
drew
window
i
had
a
who
was
a
sailor
i
ca
tell
you
what
feel
of
the
deck
beneath
my
feet
what
a
sense
of
sea
by
day
and
by
night
i
have
at
times
but
then
of
course
in
the
far
back
i
must
join
many
sailors
i
those
folk
that
my
own

they
led

lead
their

wherever
they
are
they
lead

he
fell
silent
and
curtin
too
rode
silent
they
were
now
above
the
valley
their
road
climbing
overpassing
a
great
hill
they
came
to
a
threadlike
green
vale
and
crossing
this
climbed
bear
mountain
behind
which
rose
the
great
head
of
rock
when
they
reached
a
gushing
mountain
spring
they
dismounted
and
seated
on
moss
and
leaves
under
a
tall
mountain
linden
all
palely
gold
ate
the
bread
and
cheese
and
damson
tart
and
drank
the
cider
that
sweet
rocket
had
put
in
the
bag
they
carried
their
feast
ended
they
rested
on
the
springy
fragrant
earth
drew
began
again
remembrance
if
i
had
a
hundred
per
cent
better
brain
and
i
suppose
one
day
the
brain
of
all
of
us
will
be
a
hundred
a
thousand
per
cent
ahead
of
what
it
is
now
i
am
convinced
that
i
could
remember
not
only
down
the
stalk
of
myself
but
out
into
the
branches
right
and
left
the
tree
conscious
from
leaf
to
root
from
root
to
leaf
the
whole
tree
conscious
aware
up
and
down
and
to
and
fro
and
as
somewhere
all
the
forest
joins
on
the
forest
conscious
and
aware
up
and
down
of
its
history
then
the
forest
runs
into
all
the
forests
high
and
low
the
everlasting
forest
and
all
its
adventures
he
looked
as
though
he
rode
in
that
forest
out
of
it
comes
the
tree
that
sheds
the
forests
and
never
once
need
we
lose
consciousness
in
finding
that
tree
that
what
linden
said
to
me
he
said
the
ash
yggdrasil
you
all
things
and
all
people
you
share
them
and
they
share
you
you
to
extend
extend
your
sense
of
that
the
one
is
to
come
down
and
lay
hold
upon
you
and
still
you
shall
find
it
home
and
yourself

they
rode
over
bear
mountain
and
at
last
up
rock
five
hundred
feet
below
the
top
lay
a
green
depression
named
hall
gap
here
a
cabins
made
hall
town
the
people
now
owned
rock
mountain
its
rich
forests
and
rushing
waters
a
road
was
in
the
making
and
that
and
other
department
plans
brought
to
hall
gap
preliminary
groups
the
present
group
being
a
surveying
engineering
and
reporting
one
with
malcolm
smith
for
head
under
him
he
had
cooper
and
morris
randall
and
drew
with
axmen
and
spademen
hired
from
the
mountain
the
cabins
in
the
gap
lodged
them
all
curtin
and
drew
reached
this
place
before
sunset
the
men
were
coming
in
dogs
barked
the
smell
of
coffee
and
bacon
hung
in
the
air
randall
welcomed
them
and
presently
malcolm
smith
appeared
and
shook
hands
they
had
supper
in
hall
big
double
cabin
with
hall
and
hall
and
half
a
dozen
young
halls
but
after
supper
they
went
to
a
neighboring
cabin
for
the
time
being
their
own
pine
knots
blazed
on
the
hearth
malcolm
smith
and
cooper
and
morris
randall
and
drew
and
martin
curtin
stretched
tired
limbs
and
smoked
and
talked
morris
and
cooper
presently
played
checkers
malcolm
smith
read
the
newspaper
but
after
a
little
put
it
down
and
talked
he
talked
of
aviation
and
wireless
and
of
einstein
notion
of
space
and
of
atomic
energy
an
idea
that
ideas
ideation
generally
imagery
perhaps
memory
are
simply
that
energy
functioning
we
imagine
and
that
energy
has
constructed
a
form
in
ether
we
use
it
blindly
weakly
unintelligently
but
if
i
see
but
if
we
used
it
enormously
more
strongly
and
wisely
we
be
creators
all
night
it
getting
very
important
to
know
what
we
do
want
to
create
if
we
do
look
out
presently
we
may
find
that
our
imaginations
have
life
we
got
to
choose
i
suppose
what
kind
of
life
we
give
silly
or
monstrous
life
or
intelligent
kindly
strong
beautiful
life
curtin
enjoyed
the
evening
on
rock
flame
and
odor
of
burning
pine
and
the
pleasantly
grotesque
shadows
on
the
cabin
walls
made
for
rich
fancies
in
one
of
the
easy
silences
the
men
grouped
in
this
brown
and
place
seemed
to
him
genii
gathered
here
before
they
drove
their
roads
over
mountains
or
harnessed
their
plunging
water
steeds
he
thought
we
are
genii
how
wonderful
it
is
to
be
what
we
are
and
shall
be
men
at
hall
went
to
bed
before
ten
curtin
found
in
a
small
cabin
a
hard
couch
and
honest
sleep
he
slept
without
turning
till
five
of
the
morning
when
he
waked
with
a
great
sense
of
refreshment
where
i
have
been
i
do
know
but
it
was
where
vigor
flows
the
stars
shone
in
at
his
window
he
lay
still
for
a
few
minutes
then
rose
the
air
was
not
too
chill
he
found
when
he
was
dressed
that
he
was
warm
enough
opening
the
cabin
door
he
went
out
moving
softly
so
as
not
to
waken
drew
and
randall
the
morning
star
hung
in
the
east
and
near
it
the
moon
in
her
last
quarter
the
cold
first
hyacinth
of
dawn
streaked
the
sky
drew
had
pointed
out
the
path
to
the
top
of
the
mountain
curtin
finding
it
climbed
it
alone
half
an
hour
brought
him
to
the
summit
when
he
reached
it
the
earth
was
bathed
in
the
cool
and
violet
first
light
he
found
a
great
projecting
rock
shaped
like
a
chair
and
took
his
seat
here
the
planet
from
gold
was
become
silver
and
the
moon
hung
like
a
dream
canoe
here
or
there
mist
hid
the
vast
expanse
below
but
for
the
most
part
earth
lay
clear
the
outthrust
rock
that
was
his
seat
gave
him
of
the
circle
stillness
with
depth
and
power
possessed
curtin
he
looked
out
and
down
and
over
range
on
range
with
narrow
vales
between
rolled
the
mountains
in
the
strengthening
light
the
autumn
hue
of
them
gave
desert
tints
then
he
picked
out
clearings
and
white
points
that
were
hamlets
and
farmhouses
he
turned
eyes
to
where
would
be
sweet
rocket
though
he
could
not
see
that
valley
it
was
dawn
richard
linden
would
be
up
perhaps
guessing
that
curtin
might
watch
dawn
brighten
from
this
rock
he
might
be
here
in
mind
and
spirit
even
as
he
thought
this
the
presence
of
linden
not
there
but
here
or
both
here
and
there
came
to
curtin
in
a
wave
he
felt
company
in
solitude
doubled
life
and
not
as
he
presently
perceived
linden
only
linden
meant
thousands
of
others
as
thousands
of
others
meant
linden
thousands
and
thousands
that
was
himself
thousands
and
thousands
he
looked
north
and
east
and
west
by
rising
and
moving
he
looked
south
the
horizon
rim
lay
very
far
using
knowledge
he
let
it
farther
drop
away
drop
away
underneath
him
was
the
bulk
of
the
earth
use
power
and
make
it
as
crystal
penetrable
as
water
or
air
overhead
and
all
around
was
air
thinning
afar
into
ether
he
saw
his
globe
in
space
and
time
a
road
of
light
ran
between
it
and
the
sun
he
sat
very
still
but
within
he
moved
into
the
land
of
contemplation
here
much
time
came
into
so
subtle
swift
was
motion
he
entered
into
touch
with
much
for
which
he
had
not
yet
found
name
or
names
he
might
say
there
is
deep
water
and
rich
land
he
might
say
the
world
is
other
than
we
thought
it
there
are
americas
ripe
for
discovery
and
there
are
farther
and
future
americas
forming
by
degrees
might
lessened
muscle
could
not
yet
hold
nor
sense
be
aware
he
came
nearer
surface
yet
still
there
was
vision
phosphor
was
paling
the
moon
a
dim
curve
of
pearl
and
all
the
spread
of
earth
in
stronger
light
curtin
gazed
and
the
eyes
of
the
mind
outran
the
eyes
of
the
flesh
not
just
virginia
but
all
the
states
not
just
the
but
all
america
canada
and
mexico
and
the
islands
and
the
republics
of
the
south
he
looked
to
the
atlantic
and
saw
on
the
farther
side
europe
and
africa
and
on
to
the
east
asia
and
the
pacific
he
saw
the
continents
and
the
nations
it
was
not
so
much
that
he
saw
their
earth
their
body
though
he
saw
that
too
but
he
saw
them
touched
them
heard
them
as
persons
the
most
of
them
had
lately
been
at
fierce
war
fibers
of
each
dissenting
but
the
bulk
warring
exhausted
from
war
haggard
and
torn
yet
still
they
made
gestures
with
broken
weapons
he
saw
them
in
the
throes
of
economic
and
political
change
of
change
from
knowledge
to
knowledge
and
of
religious
change
he
saw
traits
and
actions
deep
deep
yesterdays
at
the
point
of
and
all
the
morrows
being
built
of
yesterdays
and
he
saw
as
it
were
stain
and
chaff
and
guilt
and
through
all
these
fire
and
life
and
upspringing
they
were
persons
but
a
greater
person
held
them
light
broke
he
saw
the
earth
and
the
world
and
the
heavens
as
person
upon
him
broke
in
deluge
the
vaster
selfhood
the
sun
rose
over
rock
mountain
the
long
ranges
and
the
vales
the
air
had
the
exquisite
fresh
energy
of
hope
curtin
moved
down
the
path
to
the
cabins
all
his
being
seemed
lit
and
harmonized
it
is
what
the
old
saints
called
conversion
my
times
fall
into
the
hand
of
the
one
that
i
am
the
rosy
light
shone
on
hall
below
him
as
it
shone
on
sweet
rocket
and
alder
and
the
virginia
farms
and
villages
and
towns
and
the
farms
and
villages
and

of
every

fragrant
smoke
rose
from
the
chimneys
he
heard
the
cheerful
voices
a
great
love
of
the
neighbor
pervaded
curtin
consciousness
and
with
it
entered
the
neighbor
his
consciousness
and
the
consciousness
became
to
a
degree
one
xii
the
men
at
work
had
breakfast
at
hall
in
great
beauty
of
weather
afterward
curtin
went
with
them
along
the
proposed
line
of
road
it
proved
a
cheerful
group
doing
basic
work
well
the

worked

buzz

a
long
way
over
the
mountain
slope
where
they
worked

be
a
great
driveway
for

miss

dave
settled
himself
with
his
back
to
the
trunk
of
a
hemlock
he
was
lean
and
tanned
with
a
rich
drawling
voice
she
was
a
that
woman
that
i
was
telling
about
the
mountain
barked
like
a
dawg
at
her
and
showed
its
teeth
and
tried
to
bite
because
she
said
an
awful
thing
she
said
that
a
time
would
come
when
every
man
and
woman
could
do
the
things
that
jesus
did
she
said
christ
was
an
abstract
description
of
the
state
of
being
folks
would
come
to
some
day
and
jesus
was
a
great
laborer
who
got
there
earlier
than
anybody
else
said
he
was
an
example
sure
enough
and
a
shower
of
the
way
and
who
could
help
loving
and
wondering
but
to
her
the
best
way
to
love
jesus
was
to
stop
jest
wondering
and
grow
said
that
bethlehem
and
nazareth
and
galilee
and
jerusalem
and
the
new
jerusalem
were
where
any
man
or
woman
was
brother
carraway
preached
against
her
and
the
mountain
decided
she
was
healthy
for
it
she
was
living
all
alone
but
the
mountain
decided
that
her
cabin
had
better
be
emptier
yet
she
was
a
tall
woman
about
the
age
of
my
mother
and
when
you
looked
at
her
you
think
at
first
she
was
strong
brother
carraway
after
he
had
preached
went
on
home
but
james
curdy
always
took
what
he
found
in
the
word
and
tried
to
do
it
what
he
found
was
usually
right
harsh
james
had
black
eyes
pushed
in
and
long
hair
that
always
seemed
to
me
to
be
blowing
in
a
wind
he
was
awful
fond
of
the
word
you
punished
will
punish
you
he
used
to
stride
around
and
do
his
best
to
see
that
god
did
forget
it
he
was
one
to
see
that
god
did
his
duty
was
james
he
could
always
make
the
mountain
look
at
things
same
as
he
did
but
after
brother
carraway
sermon
and
the
lightning
striking
barber
house
and
killing
old
barber
he
got
of
it
worked
right
up
to
his
feelings
that
was
tuesday
after
sunday
the
lightning
having
struck
on
saturday
and
barber
buried
on
monday
he
got
about
thirty
men
and
boys
together
at
john
williams
and
a
lot
of
them
had
had
whisky
i
do
know
that
this
air
interestin
i
could
sing
to
you
about
john
horn
and
betsy
no
go
on
they
were
going
to
drive
miss
ellice
off
the
mountain
that
was
the
intention
but
this
very
indian
creek
about
a
mile
from
here
makes
a
pool
that
called
dumb
child
pool
because
little
johnny
nelson
that
was
dumb
was
drowned
there
he
fell
in
while
the
children
were
gathering
nuts
and
he
could
make
them
hear
well
those
that
had
had
something
stronger
than
water
they
were
all
for
seeing
if
miss
ellice
was
a
witch
you
know
how
folk
used
to
prove
a
witch
that
was
about
twenty
of
the
eager
ones
mostly
young
men
this
was
very
recent
i
was
living
on
this
mountain
but
on
stormy
mountain
over
thar
i
came
here
when
lucinda
nelson
and
me
married
but
i
heard
all
about
it
he
spat
vigorously
now
this
is
where
her
seeing
with
other
eyes
than
like
yourn
and
mine
comes
in
and
how
i
come
to
know
about
some
things
that
others
do
was
that
that
very
lucinda
nelson
that
i
married
happened
to
be
at
miss
ellice
that
day
nelsons
ai
afraid
of
anything
and
miss
ellice
had
done
them
neighborly
turns
sitting
up
with
the
sick
and
sharing
coffee
and
such
as
that
anyhow
lucinda
was
there
and
miss
ellice
was
braiding
a
rug
and
seemed
extraordinarily
cheerful
and
sunny
about
two
of
the
clock
as
it
were
she
broke
off
her
talk
and
finished
her
row
as
it
might
be
without
looking
at
it
then
she
says
to
lucinda
and
lucinda
says
she
was
that
still
and
sunny
like
a
day
that
comes
sometimes
that
she
was
afraid
of
her
just
as
you
afraid
sometimes
of
that
kind
of
day
and
yet
you
want
to
stay
by
it
and
it
to
stay
by
you
she
says
says
she
like
you
to
stay
longer
lucinda
but
i
find
that
i
got
something
to
do
you
go
along
honey
and
if
i
do
see
you
again
i
want
you
to
remember
that
i
like
you
and
think
you
on
the
right
road
and
with
that
she
got
up
and
kissed
lucinda
and
stood
in
the
door
to
watch
her
down
the
path
lucinda
went
along
home
well
in
about
two
hours
here
they
come
james
curdy
and
mat
waters
and
jonathan
morgan
and
the
others
drunk
with
whisky
and
with
what
they
thought
was
the
word
of
god
they
had
a
rope
and
they
meant
the
dumb
child
pool
he
spat
again
was
jonathan
morgan
that
told
me
and
lucinda
the
rest
of
it
he
was
young
and
wild
in
those
days
jonathan
says
he
had
been
drinking
and
for
all
that
now
and
then
he
shouted
with
the
rest
he
had
never
seen
a
day
so
sunny
and
still
and
just
the
minute
after
shouted
he
see
the
whole
as
in
a
picture
his
crowd
and
the
dumb
child
pool
and
miss
ellice
cabin
kind
of
saw
it
out
of
himself
as
it
were
as
though
he
was
sitting
on
the
bough
of
a
tree
looking
seeing
thar
as
well
as
here
but
the
rest
of
them
i
reckon
did
see
nothing
but
a
witch
and
something
exciting
to
do
unless
it
was
james
curdy
and
what
he
saw
and
felt
lord
knows
something
like
a
nightmare
i
reckon
miss
ellice
cabin
was
high
on
the
mountain
they
stopped
shouting
when
they
got
nearly
up
thar
they
thought
that
if
before
that
miss
ellice
heard
them
she
just
think
it
was
some
jamboree
going
on
alongside
of
mountain
james
curdy
had
such
a
rule
that
he
could
bring
even
the
drunken
ones
quiet
for
a
bit
so
they
stole
up
the
path
and
jonathan
said
that
the
cabin
above
them
looked
like
a
goldy
leaf
hanging
still
or
like
an
empty
nest
so
they
went
up
in
a
string
till
they
got
to
where
the
trees
stopped
and
there
was
just
some
bushes
and
grass
and
then
they
spread
out
and
went
on
in
a
bunch
and
james
curdy
cried
in
a
loud
voice
come
forth
but
the
shut
door
did
open
then
he
cried
it
again
and
then
he
opened
that
tight
mouth
of
his
the
third
time
he
had
more
learning
than
most
of
the
mountain
and
he
used
big
words
atheist
come
forth
but
the
others
would
stay
quiet
any
longer
and
they
shouted
witch
the
door
stayed
shut
and
jonathan
said
that
the
cabin
hung
like
a
goldy
leaf
or
a
nest
high
up
on
a
bright
still
winter
day
jonathan
says
there
was
something
so
still
and
sunny
there
that
it
stilled
the
shouting
then
they
opened
the
door
for
it
was
bolted
and
those
that
could
get
in
went
in
james
curdy
at
the
head
those
outside
spread
around
so
they
could
catch
her
if
she
run
out
but
miss
ellice
at
home
she
was
gone
thar
was
her
rug
and
her
chair
and
a
little
fire
on
the
hearth
but
she
was
there
it
turned
out
that
she
had
taken
a
bag
and
a
basket
with
her
clothes
and
a
little
money
she
had
and
then
mat
waters
found
the
letter
on
the
table
and
jonathan
morgan
read
it
because
james
curdy
had
left
his
spectacles
at
home
and
if
believe
me
it
was
directed
to
curdy
and
matthew
waters
and
jonathan
morgan
and
their
company
inside
it
said
just
this
loved
this
cabin
and
this
mountain
but
now
i
remove
myself
from
among
you
yet
i
love
this
place
where
i
have
been
and
am
and
shall
be
now
abideth
faith
hope
and
charity
but
the
greatest
of
these
is
charity
and
then
there
was
the
name
ann
ellice
jonathan
said
half
of
them
were
still
drunk
and
outrageous
because
they
could
have
their
fun
at
dumb
child
pool
a
lot
did
even
listen
to
the
letter
seeing
with
their
own
eyes
that
miss
ellice
was
gone
james
curdy
listened
and
his
face
got
white
and
his
eyes
red
coals
brazen
says
he
devil
talks
scripture
to
his
own
damnation
he
went
out
of
door
and
looked
about
him
but
most
of
the
rest
did
see
anything
but
that
they
lost
something
exciting
to
do
they
began
to
break
up
the
furniture
then
some
one
raked
the
coals
and
brands
out
over
the
floor
and
they
set
the
straw
bed
on
fire
but
jonathan
took
the
letter
and
a
book
or
two
she
had
lucinda
got
the
books
now
but
james
curdy
stood
outside
and
looked
down
mountain
harris
cabin
a
mile
over
thar
it
likely
she
thar
and
he
began
to
go
down
over
mountain
side
mat
waters
and
jonathan
morgan
followed
him
and
so
did
about
half
of
the
others
the
rest
stayed
to
burn
the
cabin
the
witch
had
gone
off
on
a
broomstick
for
them
the
harrises
were
a
kind
of
lonely
folk
that
did
go
much
to
church
or
nowhar
they
might
even
have
heard
of
brother
carraway
sermon
she
might
be
thar
as
james
curdy
thought
but
she
was
she
had
been
thar
they
said
jest
a
minute
she
looked
in
on
old
aunt
viny
harris
and
said
she
was
going
away
said
she
was
going
to
foot
of
mountain
to
norwood
whar
you
get
the
train
aunt
viny
asked
when
she
was
coming
back
and
miss
ellice
smiled
and
said
she
did
think
she
was
coming
back
was
she
going
to
live
she
said
she
did
exactly
know
but
she
had
kinsmen
who
would
take
care
of
her
said
aunt
viny
a
master
weaver
and
worker
and
any
folk
ought
to
be
glad
to
have
such
a
handy
woman
around
which
shows
that
the
harrises
heard
anything
and
so
aunt
viny
said
miss
ellice
said
very
friendly
and
went
on
down
mountain
james
curdy
wanted
to
set
a
hound
of
harris
on
her
track
and
the
drunk
ones
shouted
at
that
and
one
staggered
out
to
get
the
dawg
but
jonathan
he
represented
that
miss
ellice
would
be
down
mountain
now
and
out
on
big
road
where
the
tracks
would
be
all
mixed
up
and
covered
and
anyhow
the
folk
down
there
would
understand
and
let
it
be
done
by
that
time
the
cabin
was
burning
up
on
mountain
above
them
they
could
see
the
smoke
and
light
james
curdy
had
to
let
it
be
though
doubtless
he
had
some
hard
thoughts
of
the
almighty
well
that
is
the
end
of
it
she
did
ever
come
back
it
ai
much
of
a
story
i
do
know
why
i
told
it
to
you
you
do
know
where
she
went
no
mountain
folk
ai
curious
in
them
ways
you
better
have
let
me
sing
to
you
about
john
horn
lucinda
says
she
took
her
body
away
but
not
her
spirit
says
she
can
feel
her
any
still
and
sunny
day
i
reckon
jonathan
morgan
feels
the
same
way
i
do
know
it
been
a
long
time
ago
brother
carraway
dead
and
jonathan
morgan
is
brother
morgan
now
and
preaches
in
the
old
church
things
air
sure
changing
in
this
world
last
summer
i
heard
him
say
myself
that
christ
was
inside
us
and
not
outside
might
never
have
been
outside
us
so
much
in
the
world
being
parable
james
curdy
so
old
now
he
could
do
anything
but
look
mad
as
an
old
beast
in
winter
and
get
right
up
and
go
out
of
church
looking
like
a
snow
cloud
and
talking
to
himself
lucinda
says
people
keep
on
acting
and
persuading
if
we
see
them
or
if
we
do
see
them
he
lifted
himself
long
lank
and
brown
and
moved
from
the
hemlock
you
air
welcome
smith
you
better
speak
to
jim
harris
about
them
logs
xiii
malcolm
smith
talking
with
curtin
in
the
cool
twilight
before
hall
had
no
word
against
drew
departure
for
sweet
rocket
he
a
valuable
likable
fellow
there
a
curious
sense
when
you
are
with
him
of
depth
or
background
that
he
does
understand
himself
violin
wood
he
says
that
this
friend
of
yours
has
something
to
teach
that
he
wants
to
learn
that
all
right
i
can
generally
tell
when
a
man
real
destiny
is
ruling
him
i
got
that
feeling
now
about
drew
he
needs
to
buy
in
a
certain
city
and
he
going
there
if
we
here
next
year
and
a
lot
to
do
on
rock
mountain
i
be
glad
to
take
him
on
again
bedtime
came
again
curtin
slept
profoundly
restfully
waked
early
and
climbed
again
to
crest
of
mountain
to
see
again
the
sun
rise
over
so
great
expanse
he
sat
in
the
stone
chair
and
before
him
hung
the
morning
star
and
the
senescent
moon
below
them
was
spread
violet
and
jonquil
and
one
strange
sea
of
blue
again
he
felt
the
spiritual
sun
he
thought
this
is
what
they
have
perceived
at
sweet
rocket
they
have
not
waited
for
death
they
live
now
and
forever
and
know
it
this
body
will
go
from
them
but
they
are
building
or
remembering
i
do
not
know
which
and
perhaps
it
is
both
a
life
that
will
not
go
from
them
and
i
also
also
though
i
am
a
babe
yet
sitting
in
the
hollow
of
stone
at
the
top
of
the
upraised
wave
of
earth
he
watched
the
sunrise
from
rock
mountain
he
conceived
that
what
was
true
of
him
was
true
of
others
had
been
true
age
after
age
was
true
now
over
this
round
earth
of
others
he
thought
there
has
always
been
a
fellowship
the
eidelweiss
does
not
guess
the
roses
and
the
heliotrope
nor
the
violet
and
the
meadow
rue
but
at
last
the
garden
of
the
earth
guesses
it
becomes
the
living
garden
the
living
garden
becomes
the
living
man
naught
is
right
naught
is
reasonable
until
you
get
it
from
the
whole
the
sun
rose
the
earth
turned
ruddy
curtin
went
down
the
path
to
hall
breakfasting
there
with
the
men
who
worked
with
head
and
hands
this
morning
he
and
drew
would
start
for
sweet
rocket
drew
slender
luggage
was
going
down
mountain
to
norwood
whence
the
train
would
take
it
to
alder
every
one
liked
drew
even
cooper
who
laughed
at
him
good
luck
old
farmer
ride
over
and
see
us
sometime
the
two
rode
down
rock
and
crossed
a
vale
like
a
green
and
gold
ribbon
and
went
up
bear
mountain
where
the
oaks
were
all
deep
colored
and
down
bear
and
over
forested
hills
and
on
by
the
trail
that
struck
into
the
alder
road
they
went
rather
silently
but
in
a
deep
contented
companionship
once
drew
spoke
he
said
good
present
is
one
in
which
the
past
betters
its
condition
when
he
said
he
there
was
meant
richard
linden
after
this
there
was
silence
again
both
having
struck
some
road
within
where
is
the
network
composed
of
all
the
roads
of
the
world
they
approached
sweet
rocket
the
forest
fell
away
before
them
shone
the
river
the
wheat
and
orchard
land
and
the
ruddy
house
with
its
pillars
of
mellowed
white
and
the
hills
that
inclosed
through
part
of
the
day
clouds
had
been
driving
across
the
sky
now
they
were
sinking
before
the
southwest
wind
leaving
the
blue
arch
they
were
variformed
castles
and
towers
bridges
alps
cities
ships
mythical
beasts
giants
light
embraced
them
in
a
spray
of
colors
crossing
to
it
for
one
instant
curtin
saw
sweet
rocket
transfigured
all
that
was
strong
and
fair
became
a
hundredfold
stronger
fairer
all
that
deterred
or
roughened
or
overweighted
or
twisted
or
weakened
vanished
in
warmth
and
light
a
sheath
or
husk
or
burr
fell
away
interior
power
rousing
itself
he
saw
the
place
in
its
seraph
aspect
eternal
in
the
heavens
drew
seemed
to
share
the
perception
he
said
abruptly
there
is
splendor
they
felt
splendor
then
it
closed
like
light
withdrawn
warmth
screened
away
there
stood
sweet
rocket
in
its
earthly
estate
that
is
they
thought
it
its
old
earthly
estate
but
by
that
much
it
had
become
endowed
and
was
not
the
old
earthly
estate
they
had
checked
their
horses
curtin
said
so
it
was
always
in
poetry
the
younger
man
had
a
curious
gesture
we
gather
all
the
household
gear
into
the
long
ship
and
put
forth
but
curtin
thought
in
the
bible
noah
gathers
all
the
lifeseed
into
the
ark
and
rides
the
waters
into
a
new
world
they
crossed
the
river
and
went
up
the
little
glistening
beach
and
by
the
cedars
to
the
house
sweet
rocket
welcomed
them
home
the
white
folk
and
the
colored
folk
and
tam
they
found
the
household
increased
by
two
linden
said
these
are
my
cousins
robert
and
frances
dane
who
come
for
a
little
while
each
year
to
sweet
rocket
they
were
a
married
pair
a
little
above
forty
perhaps
the
mark
of
the
city
upon
them
they
had
quick
and
nervous
bodies
thin
lined
faces
eyes
well
apart
burning
deep
and
very
steady
lips
tending
to
compression
they
seemed
tired
about
them
breathed
something
of
soldiers
after
a
long
day
march
through
hostile
elements
this
was
bivouac
this
was
rest
at
first
they
were
too
tired
there
was
almost
resentment
o
god
can
you
be
still
and
ageless
this
changed
little
by
little
at
sweet
rocket
the
overtension
disappeared
they
were
left
taut
collected
wary
workers
worthy
of
praise
in
a
dangerous
world
at
the
supper
table
that
evening
curtin
made
out
more
and
more
of
their
life
they
had
come
yesterday
a
little
before
their
set
time
and
anna
darcy
had
the
start
of
him
in
acquaintanceship
intellectual
radicals
certainly
members
of
some
group
in
action
probably
of
more
groups
than
one
jack
of
all
agitations
and
master
of
one
he
could
hear
them
speaking
in
halls
and
under
open
sky
and
he
could
see
the
face
of
the
throng
to
which
they
spoke
they
would
be
speaking
of
soviet
russia
of
guild
socialism
of
employer
and
employed
and
the
course
of
labor
that
did
never
yet
run
smooth
there
were
causes
not
so
apparently
economic
for
which
also
they
would
work
he
heard
them
speaking
for
the
suffrage
amendment
and
likewise
for
the
release
of
conscientious
objectors
they
belonged
here
they
belonged
there
the
one
he
was
later
told
was
associate
editor
of
a
journal
that
was
making
the
step
from
liberalism
of
the
left
to
communism
of
the
right
the
woman
was
an
admirable
violinist
he
knew
that
they
lived
on
little
and
gave
much
of
that
little
away
they
lived
where
it
was
possible
to
live
in
one
big
room
and
three
small
rooms
they
had
a
son
who
was
doing
well
at
a
school
they
liked
in
the
country
to
look
at
them
was
to
see
how
hard
they
worked
and
to
look
into
their
eyes
was
to
see
the
beacon
that
set
them
and
kept
them
at
work
they
also
had
vision
of
oneness
though
in
talking
linden
and
marget
used
in
a
much
less
marked
degree
the
terminology
used
by
the
newcomers
it
seemed
to
present
no
difficulties
to
them
they
seemed
to
understand
these
guests
as
they
understood
those
others
who
had
come
to
sweet
rocket
this
october
to
understand
and
to
travel
with
them
curtin
thought
they
sympathize
it
does
not
occur
to
them
to
say
something
else
take
another
road
he
thought
that
is
their
strength
they
utterly
share
frances
dane
had
brought
her
violin
to
sweet
rocket
yesterday
it
had
been
laid
in
the
parlor
now
after
supper
sitting
by
the
fire
in
the
old
room
the
violin
spoke
it
told
of
the
player
passion
for
the
world
of
the
man
who
wrote
that
music
passion
for
the
world
of
the
passion
for
the
world
of
all
makers
of
violins
and
of
the
trees
whose
wood
was
used
of
the
passion
for
the
world
that
is
progression
and
revolution
of
the
passion
for
the
world
that
is
the
slower
rate
that
is
called
withstanding
progression
and
revolution
of
the
passion
for
the
world
that
is
music
of
the
passion
for
the
world
yesterday
and
forever
of
the
passion
for
the
world
that
every
heart
of
us
knows
xiv
it
is
something
like
this
said
linden
we
are
one
being
with
its
mighty
potencies
all
that
comes
in
comes
to
us
all
that
goes
forth
goes
from
us
the
points
that
take
ponder
sort
combine
alter
to
better
liking
the
mighty
poles
the
mighty
afferent
and
efferent
that
flow
from
pole
to
pole
all
that
is
movement
that
is
gravitation
that
is
cohesion
that
is
justice
that
is
harmony
that
is
love
are
ours
we
go
as
we
have
gone
through
time
from
and
toward
the
from
that
is
also
toward
the
toward
that
is
also
from
but
something
beyond
time
as
we
have
known
it
beyond
space
and
causation
as
we
have
known
them
increases
upon
us
consciousness
in
some
sort
of
the
whole
orb
awareness
through
and
through
is
momentously
upon
us
in
the
end
all
desire
is
desire
for
that
we
shall
move
then
in
if
you
choose
to
put
it
so
it
is
an
allowable
figure
all
that
present
language
can
devise
is
but
a
word
a
figure
a
symbol
what
we
mean
is
the
next
advance
in
consciousness
when
you
have
it
you
know
it
they
were
treading
a
slender
path
through
october
fields
now
they
were
in
a
great
climbing
cornfield
all
stacked
corn
like
brown
wigwams
and
here
and
there
upon
the
brown
and
stubbly
earth
the
orange
of
pumpkins
the
air
folded
them
in
violet
and
gold
dust
and
faint
frankincense
the
hills
had
changed
in
color
so
many
leaves
being
shaken
down
on
days
like
this
the
mountains
were
evidently
entranced
it
was
indian
summer
before
the
indian
summer
time
a
new
consciousness
said
frances
dane
walking
with
curtin
a
consciousness
it
is
in
the
air
yes
wise
men
saying
have
seen
his
star
in
the
east
oh
that
a
figure
there
is
some
reality
or
thousands
of
us
would
not
be
hearkening
as
we
are
hearkening
a
new
man
a
new
creature
it
a
consummation
devoutly
to
be
desired
the
heaped
corn
stood
around
the
orange
globes
made
constellations
on
the
earth
they
were
now
well
up
the
slope
at
their
feet
sweet
rocket
and
the
little
sliding
river
all
was
reflected
all
was
veiled
but
now
and
again
eyes
looked
through
the
veil
reaching
the
top
of
the
hill
they
found
there
a
tall
solitary
tree
a
black
gum
and
built
around
it
a
bench
it
linked
in
curtin
mind
with
the
sycamore
before
the
overseer
house
they
sat
upon
the
bench
and
upon
the
ring
of
brown
grass
that
ran
around
the
tree
the
view
was
fair
and
they
rested
in
silence
it
was
anna
darcy
who
noticed
how
much
silence
there
was
at
sweet
rocket
silence
that
sang
that
caressed
moments
went
by
silence
held
them
fair
solitude
sense
of
one
person
here
alone
tam
moved
coming
nearer
to
linden
the
latter
hand
dropped
to
tam
head
anna
darcy
heard
a
low
sigh
of
relief
and
burden
lifted
it
came
she
thought
from
frances
dane
who
sat
near
her
upon
the
grass
but
it
might
have
come
from
more
than
frances
from
all
stillness
and
silence
deepened
there
grew
a
cathedral
sense
a
desert
an
ocean
sense
into
that
entered
a
wealth
of
light
and
strength
a
vast
wave
of
freedom
an
access
of
life
lifted
them
they
had
life
and
they
had
it
more
abundantly
they
seemed
to
themselves
to
flash
together
and
of
them
all
was
made
a
god
for
an
instant
there
held
an
intense
vision
of
this
valley
and
of
sweet
rocket
transfigured
color
and
sound
lived
every
movement
was
of
joy
that
broke
away
vanished
like
the
image
of
a
rose
into
the
image
of
a
garden
of
ten
thousand
then
that
was
gone
into
an
image
of
all
the
earth
and
then
that
into
intense
sheer
mighty
living
with
small
regard
to
old
space
and
time
abounding
keen
a
reality
leaving
old
reality
behind
when
it
is
all
done
when
it
is
all
known
all
felt
when
we
are
fully
completely
ourself
when
we
remember
our
godhood
and
live
it
when
we
do
not
look
through
storm
for
the
lighthouse
ray
because
we
are
light
when
we
do
not
cry
father
and
son
because
we
are
both
and
know
it
when
there
is
glory
of
home
glory
of
health
glory
of
love
who
had
spoken
they
did
not
know
it
seemed
their
common
voice
perhaps
it
was
linden
but
if
so
he
spoke
as
their
common
voice
into
it
came
not
only
the
voice
of
the
seven
there
but
the
voice
of
old
morrowcombe
and
the
carters
and
of
cliff
and
mimy
and
zinia
and
mancy
and
the
others
not
just
the
voice
of
sweet
rocket
but
the
voice
of
alder
and
of
many
an
alder
big
and
little
the
voice
of
the
city
and
the
country
the
land
and
the
sea
to
be
well
oh
rise
within
me
truest
self
with
healing
in
thy
wings
the
great
golden
feeling
passed
leaving
echoes
leaving
memory
these
folk
were
separate
again
where
they
had
been
one
but
not
so
separate
in
and
out
hovered
that
breath
of
transfiguration
a
day
of
spring
in
late
winter
dying
but
with
a
tongue
to
tell
of
a
time
when
it
would
not
die
where
all
had
been
vivid
singing
laughing
now
was
the
wonted
gentleness
of
this
valley
a
dreaminess
shot
with
gold
taking
and
giving
but
doing
it
subtly
silently
only
now
and
then
bestowing
evidence
of
a
vast
interpenetrative
life
showing
like
the
eyes
through
the
veil
of
this
indian
summer
day
they
went
down
through
the
corn
and
out
by
a
gate
set
in
the
gray
and
lichened
rail
fence
where
grew
sumac
and
and
the
feathery
they
walked
in
meadows
by
the
river
and
at
last
through
the
orchard
and
so
to
the
house
mimy
in
the
kitchen
was
singing
oh
jesus
tell
you
once
befo
babylon
fallin
to
rise
no
mo
oh
go
in
peace
and
sin
no
mo
babylon
fallin
to
rise
no
mo
in
the
evening
frances
played
again
to
them
and
the
rich
and
sweet
music
filled
the
old
room
the
violin
put
by
they
talked
by
the
fire
then
linden
said
read
for
a
little
while
marget
she
took
up
a
volume
of
blake
and
read
read
that
letter
to
butts
she
read
over
sea
over
land
my
eyes
did
expand
into
regions
of
fire
remote
from
desire
the
light
of
the
morning
heaven
mountains
adorning
in
particles
bright
the
jewels
of
light
distinct
shone
and
clear
amazed
and
in
fear
i
each
particle
gazed
astonished
amazed
for
each
was
a
man
human
formed
swift
i
ran
for
they
beckoned
to
me
remote
by
the
sea
saying
grain
of
sand
every
stone
on
the
land
each
rock
and
each
hill
each
fountain
and
rill
each
herb
and
each
tree
mountain
hill
earth
and
sea
cloud
meteor
and
star
are
men
seen
my
eyes
more
and
more
like
a
sea
without
shore
continue
expanding
the
heavens
commanding
till
the
jewels
of
light
heavenly
men
beaming
bright
appeared
as
one
man
who
complacent
began
my
limbs
to
enfold
in
his
beams
of
bright
gold
like
dross
purged
away
all
my
mire
and
clay
soft
consumed
in
delight
in
his
bosom
sun
bright
i
remained
soft
he
smiled
and
i
heard
his
voice
mild
saying
is
my
fold
o
thou
ram
horned
with
gold
who
awakest
from
sleep
on
the
sides
of
the
xv
energy
in
larger
units
affinities
gathering
strength
and
flowing
together
with
power
said
curtin
everyone
has
seen
it
and
felt
it
in
some
wise
when
it
is
blamable
unguided
spirit
when
it
is
praised
de
mass
heroism
mass
enthusiasm
conflagration
of
genius
voice
of
the
people
unity
of
spirit
what
not
most
folk
have
a
glimpse
of
the
fact
that
there
is
an
ocean
of
desire
emotion
will
as
well
as
rivers
and
rivulets
marget
came
and
sat
with
them
on
the
steps
of
the
little
in
the
flower
garden
she
wore
a
great
check
apron
denoting
housekeeping
and
helping
zinia
she
sat
down
beside
them
what

you
been
doing

two
of

marget
smiled
ask
wordsworth
i
see
said
anna
darcy
very
well
do
more
than

with
a
trail
of
ivy
in
her
hand
she
looked
past
the
snapdragon
and
marigold
and
larkspur
still
blooming
so
rich
and
mild
had
been
this
autumn
then
as
the
rooms
grew
clean
i
was
with
my
mother
in
her
birthplace
two
hundred
miles
from
here
we
were
there
as
adults
moving
loving
understanding
with
a
grown
mind
but
there
in
her
childhood
and
girlhood
as
well
loving
to
contemplate
all
the
past
that
was
us
two
mine
as
hers
hers
as
mine
mind
and
feeling
ran
and
caught
up
with
her
brothers
and
sisters
her
parents
and
friends
her
parents
remembered
their
parents
and
those
remembered
theirs
home
rose
after

after

after
loved

her

were
upon

whose
eyes
were
upon
her
do
you
not
see
that
you
can
that
you
will
recover
it
all
all
that
you
have
been
and
you
have
been
very
much
all
that
you
are
and
you
are
very
much
mimy
singing
floated
to
them
from
the
kitchen
there
a
great
camp
meeting
in
the
promised
land
oh
pat
yo
foot
chillun
do
you
get
weary
there
a
great
camp
meeting
in
the
promised
land
and
then
said
marget
i
was
in
rome
with
richard
the
sun
shone
the
wind
was
in
cypress
and
pine
the
fountains
made
liquid
sound
father
tiber
glided
saint
peter
stood
we
went
to
the
sistine
chapel
and
then
it
was
the
capitol
within
and
without
and
then
the
appian
way
and
all
the
campagna
all
rome
not
alone
but
rome
and
then
not
rome
but
starlight
nights
from
the
decks
of
ships
and
then
this
was
actuality
while
your
hands
swept
and
dusted
the
parlor
there
my
body
was
in
its
duty
and
happy
there
yes
actuality
but
of
another
order
an
order
we
are
coming
into
the
order
of
intensified
guided
memory
and
imagination
and
of
reason
and
of
reason
profoundly
so
it
is
reason
that
is
guiding
reason
has
its
higher
levels
grows
comprehensive
knows
longer
sequences
completer
syntheses
and
from
the
decks
of
ships
we
were
in
the
desert
watching
the
stars
shepherds
on
the
hills
and
shepherds
on
the
plains
shepherds
and
villagers
and
wanderers
of
far
days
she
lifted
hand
and
arm
in
a
curious
and
commanding
gesture
watching
the
skies
above
queen
rain
and
king
wind
in
desert
and
plain
and
upon
hills
and
on
seas
thousands
and
thousands
of
us
strewn
in
time
for
an
appreciable
moment
to
some
degree
those
listening
to
her
became
aware
of
made
as
it
were
junction
with
their
own
far
wandering
far
wondering
savage
and
barbarian
self
it
was
evident
that
drew
made
junction
they
touched
the
mind
struggling
there
and
the
lifted
gaze
the
sense
was
one
of
enormous
calm
pervasion
they
entered
into
they
aided
their
own
early
man
where
he
marked
the
heavens
and
around
them
was
the
wistfulness
of
early
lands
marget
spoke
on
then
while
i
worked
we
were
building
pyramids
and
mountains
of
the
god
we
were
watching
and
watching
patterning
and
naming
comparing
all
the
skies
the
moon
and
the
planets
and
the
times
of
the
sun
and
the
white
path
through
the
heavens
and
the
great
named
princes
everywhere
swarthy
folk
and
pale
folk
now
we
were
many
and
many
then
in
us
rose
the
devoted
the
searchers
of
the
skies
seeking
from
city
roofs
and
temple
roofs
knowledge
of
the
whole
for
the
whole
their
interior
self
opened
its
wings
and
used
its
eyes
as
space
expanded
so
did
time
they
were
there
in
the
october
sunshine
on
the
steps
but
likewise
they
attended
and
in
some
vast
liberated
way
they
were
that
collective
effort
that
process
they
might
carry
the
method
over
into
all
processes
there
swam
across
the
mind
other
words
commerce
government
family
many
and
many
a
word
marget
voice
went
on
now
one
has
made
a
telescope
our
theories
change
we
stand
on
dead
theories
and
study
on
thousands
of
us
studying
thousands
building
knowledge
learning
vision
we
gaze
we
watch
we
turn
to
desks
and
write
and
figure
we
reason
we
divine
we
better
our
instruments
we
gather
results
and
make
fortunate
guesses
we
hearken
to
intuition
we
stand
on
a
mossy
stone
in
space
and
study
the
promised
land
the
universe
that
is
ours
the
ever
perpetuating
the
ever
bettering
time
widens
here
are
mountain
summits
and
the
observatories
of
this
day
and
the
clockwork
and
the
pierced
dome
and
the
great
eye
that
we
have
made
and
the
photograph
mind
sits
at
the
knee
of
great
mind
and
learns
its
alphabet
and
all
the
thousands
that
were
and
are
and
will
be
are
one
astronomer
and
it
is
i
still
working
to
know
she
ceased
to
speak
and
sat
wrapped
in
the
golden
light
said
robert
dane
we
follow
where
you
step
you
make
us
follow
you
i
do
not
make
you
you
walk
with
me
because
you
can
walk
we
walk
it
is
your
self
as
it
is
mine
we
move
and
we
feel
then
where
you
are
you
live
there
more
fully
and
keenly
than
we
but
we
can
breathe
and
feel
and
see
go
on
we
would
have
your
life
as
you
have
ours
then
after
the
stars
while
i
wound
the
clocks
i
walked
into
the
minute
again
thousands
of
us
working
and
watching
noting
divining
thousands
and
thousands
years
past
and
and
and
one
devises
the

all
the

into

into
the

the
infinite
dance
of

and
small

the
intensed

endeavor
using
perception
as
fine
as
the

working
the
great
and
the
small
we
who
forever
remember
and
make
richer
ourself
we
the
i
and
then
i
was
again
with
my
dead
who
are
just
as
much
and
just
as
little
dead
as
i
myself
and
then
i
came
out
into
the
garden
they
sat
on
the
steps
and
the
marigolds
glowed
around
them
she
spoke
again
here
and
there
throughout
the
past
and
often
now
i
think
in
our
own
day
a
man
or
woman
lays
hold
upon
faculties
that
some
day
all
will
lay
hold
upon
greater
things
than
forerunners
pioneers
regard
this
late
flood
of
books
describing
communion
with
the
dead
and
giving
detail
of
the
life
hereafter
what
they
describe
is
the
widening
consciousness
here
and
now
the
increasing
awareness
one
does
not
wait
for
death
richard
and
i
would
not
have
you
think
that
we
are
deep
deep
deep
in
that
realm
were
it
so
nothing
could
hide
it
were
we
or
any
full
in
the
next
order
you
would
see
the
shining
we
are
not
there
but
we
are
in
motion
toward
it
as
are
many
the
road
thitherward
has
its
great
scenery
and
long
thrilling
adventure
and
you
too
all
of
you
too
are
in
motion
toward
it
in
this
day
of
ours
each
day
of
the
sun
more
and
more
are
in
motion
she
rose
from
the
step
i
have
rested
this
body
that
we
call
marget
land
and
now
i
shall
put
it
again
to
work
in
the
house
we
call
sweet
rocket
xvi
that
evening
after
she
had
played
to
them
frances
fell
to
telling
of
a
crippled
boy
almost
a
man
living
in
a
poor
flat
in
new
york
the
father
an
overworked
head
clerk
the
mother
a
strong
gadabout
person
more
apt
to
reproach
than
to
sustain
there
was
a
sister
a
stenographer
who
meant
to
marry
if
she
could
some
employer
this
boy
had
a
passion
for
travel
who
could
rarely
travel
as
far
as
the
street
at
intervals
when
his
father
had
leisure
to
accompany
him
he
went
to
a
movie
if
the
piece
had
scenery
country
and
ocean
and
strange
cities
moving
throngs
and
great
buildings
and
places
of
which
he
had
read
he
was
happy
he
took
the
and
got
travel
books
from
a
library
he
knew
more
of
the
earth
surface
than
did
many
a
traveled
person
but
it
was
hot
in
the
city
in
his
little
stuffy
room
or
it
was
cold
in
the
city
in
houses
that
could
never
buy
coal
in
quantity
he
had
a
good
deal
of
pain
and
his
eyes
got
bigger
and
bigger
curtin
had
claimed
the
small
bedroom
at
the
end
of
the
upper
hall
drew
slept
in
the
room
above
frances
and
robert
dane
possessed
the
large
room
opposite
marget
next
to
linden
here
were
four
windows
and
each
narrow
bed
placed
where
it
might
look
forth
this
night
the
danes
talked
awhile
then
addressed
themselves
to
sleep
robert
slept
but
frances
found
that
she
was
wakeful
yet
she
had
definitely
turned
from
care
and
question
of
the
day
from
concern
for
her
own
work
left
in
suspension
even
from
the
face
and
incident
of
sweet
rocket
from
her
pillow
she
saw
the
stars
as
they
rimmed
and
rose
above
the
mountains
at
first
she
seemed
to
be
over
there
with
the
shadow
below
and
the
diamond
above
but
then
to
herself
she
left
it
all
there
seemed
naught
about
her
but
cool
space
she
lay
without
fret
at
wakefulness
though
she
was
intensely
awake
she
became
aware
that
waking
she
was
becoming
rested
refreshed
as
though
she
had
profoundly
slept
she
was
awake
above
the
old
waking
the
old
waking
was
dreaminess
to
this
state
vigor
poured
into
her
being
and
all
the
past
was
passed
that
is
it
was
passed
in
its
heaviness
and
friction
its
strain
and
anxiety
all
that
seemed
to
drop
away
like
dross
leaving
gold
it
was
curious
her
sense
of
gold
color
of
all
things
in
a
gold
light
of
their
own
not
from
without
she
became
distinctly
aware
of
influences
they
were
good
she
acquiesced
yes
i
will
travel
with
you
will
consenting
her
strength
was
added
to
those
other
strengths
in
the
plane
where
she
now
was
flashed
out
marget
richard
certainly
they
were
where
she
had
been
wont
to
call
within
her
but
certainly
she
felt
them
was
aware
of
them
presently
saw
them
as
never
had
she
done
before
in
that
within
though
often
in
memory
thought
and
imagination
she
like
others
had
been
with
marget
and
richard
there
within
she
had
used
those
words
as
a
matter
of
course
even
then
that
within
had
when
you
examined
it
its
own
space
and
time
its
own
mechanics
warmth
color
and
sound
that
within
and
this
within
were
of
a
piece
but
where
that
had
been
faintly
real
this
was
vividly
real
she
had
no
doubt
of
its
reality
it
was
so
but
reality
of
another
of
a
farther
on
order
marget
that
afternoon
had
talked
of
another
order
it
seemed
that
one
might
rise
or
deepen
into
it
she
was
consciously
there
now
though
in
the
order
below
it
she
rested
at
sweet
rocket
it
was
not
the
plane
of
tremendous
power
and
illumination
but
it
was
a
state
of
developed
powers
it
was
as
far
as
just
then
she
could
go
the
boy
stuart
stuart
black
how
many
a
time
had
she
wished
that
she
could
give
this
boy
travel
if
i
might
take
him
and
let
him
see
as
he
had
longed
as
he
had
imagined
himself
traveling
with
and
dane
if
i
could
travel
with
you
and
now
they
had
somehow
caught
and
held
to
the
ether
and
were
seeing
what
they
wished
to
see
the
influence
the
individuality
that
was
marget
and
richard
strongly
aided
she
was
in
rome
with
marget
and
richard
and
stuart
black
she
did
not
question
them
nor
him
and
the
boy
did
not
question
they
were
there
and
it
was
sunny
weather
and
they
were
strong
and
happy
they
stayed
in
no
hotel
they
depended
on
no
cab
nor
car
they
needed
no
food
of
the
old
sort
when
they
looked
at
one
another
they
saw
body
since
where
is
still
multiplicity
must
still
be
body
there
was
something
of
old
bodies
in
these
bodies
but
also
there
was
difference
and
all
to
the
good
old
defect
had
vanished
stuart
black
was
no
cripple
she
herself
had
lost
fatigue
there
was
translucence
a
golden
appearance
and
where
they
wished
to
go
they
were
she
wished
for
robert
and
immediately
felt
that
in
wishing
she
had
said
to
the
others
i
wish
they
strengthened
her
wish
with
theirs
here
then
was
robert
with
them
though
intermittently
not
on
the
whole
so
strongly
but
coming
as
he
could
answer
sleeping
there
at
sweet
rocket
and
now
and
then
another
joined
them
though
somewhat
dimly
and
that
was
the
boy
father
whom
he
loved
and
wished
to
include
in
his
joy
the
body
of
rome
too
was
like
and
not
like
the
old
body
of
rome
rome
had
a
self
to
match
this
self
of
theirs
spirit
and
body
and
mind
and
soul
rome
understood
itself
better
there
rose
a
rome
richer
purer
nothing
of
fair
and
wonderful
lost
all
such
quality
strengthened
the
unfair
unwise
unstrong
of
old
everywhere
tending
to
drop
the
prefix
yet
to
the
new
self
rome
was
herself
singing
enchanted
of
the
past
and
present
and
future
marget
and
richard
who
seemed
truly
one
word
had
said
a
week
in
rome
and
that
was
what
seemed
to
pass
they
saw
as
in
old
travel
they
had
seen
they
went
about
as
in
old
travel
they
had
gone
about
they
enjoyed
as
in
old
times
they
had
enjoyed
but
with
freedom
and
power
and
joy
that
left
the
old
behind
all
was
vigor
heightened
and
transfiguring
perception
and
yet
friendly
homelike
not
solemn
nor
stilted
the
boy
here
enjoying
like
a
boy
frances
became
aware
of
a
control
keeping
experience
to
a
vivid
and
fair
finiteness
not
sacrificing
current
form
that
was
for
the
boy
sake
perhaps
for
her
and
robert
also
and
after
rome
athens
an
athens
too
sublimed
and
after
athens
for
the
splendid
richness
of
things
and
for
the
boy
the
vast
north
forest
and
plain
and
an
intense
exhilaration
of
life
that
swept
out
upon
the
great
sea
and
encircled
the
earth
they
spent
long
bright
days
in
ships
and
at
ports
of
call
then
they
went
to
china
and
india
and
egypt
they
crossed
the
desert
of
sahara
and
again
in
a
great
ship
passed
between
the
pillars
of
hercules
followed
ocean
days
and
that
greater
will
and
awareness
slowly
diminishing
gently
returning
upon
its
still
habitual
self
diminishing
diminishing
slower
slower
a
little
melancholy
but
tranquil
with
a
subtle
smile
a
sense
of
a
giant
woman
in
stone
rising
from
an
islet
in
a
harbor
a
sense
of
a
familiar
city
in
the
year
a
sense
of
dreamy
farewells
a
quiet
darkness
and
lapse
frances
turned
herself
in
her
bed
at
sweet
rocket
starlight
flooding
the
room
dimly
revealed
walls
and
furniture
across
by
the
other
window
robert
lay
sleeping
how
much
time
had
passed
or
how
little
or
how
widely
could
you
live
in
no
time
at
all
here
was
reality
but
there
too
had
been
reality
it
had
been
real
that
companionship
and
that
travel
the
memory
of
it
was
memory
of
reality
mind
had
attended
there
not
less
but
more
than
here
the
whole
compound
self
had
achieved
a
unity
and
power
achievement
ungrown
wings
first
flights
she
thought
the
possibilities
o
life
of
life
our
possibilities
old
warmth
and
drowsiness
took
her
there
was
a
kindly
fatigue
as
though
she
had
walked
on
a
bright
day
to
mountain
top
and
back
and
now
thrown
herself
down
for
rest
she
saw
the
stars
through
eyes
then
slept
the
sun
was
streaming
in
when
she
waked
robert
already
up
and
dressing
she
raised
herself
upon
her
arm
good
morning
good
morning
she
rubbed
her
eyes
there
is
a
strange
and
happy
feeling
of
being
here
robert
said
that
somehow
hits
it
i
had
the
most
vivid
dream
of
long
sunny
travel
with
you
and
marget
and
richard
and
stuart
black
it
was
like
a
dream
i
feel
as
if
i
were
just
off
the
ship
had
all
the
memories
and
a
most
tremendous
refreshment
i
could
take
down
any
wall
this
morning
why
do
you
put
it
that
way
i
do
know
we
have
so
walled
ourselves
in
from
wide
doing
are
so
afraid
of
our
own
landscape
he
stood
by
the
window
i
think
i
ask
you
a
question
that
never
never
would
occur
to
gradgrind
to
ask
do
you
remember
it
too
for
instance
athens
and
some
dim
northern
forest
and
a
lot
of
islands
with
palms
do
you
remember
music
oh
it
was
all
music
and
i
think
that
i
play
it
all
my
life
dressed
they
went
down
to
the
others
zinia
bell
ringing
for
coffee
omelet
honey
and
cakes
linden
and
drew
had
eaten
and
gone
to
meet
roger
carter
and
william
where
the
winter
wood
was
being
cut
marget
sat
behind
the
coffee
urn
good
morning
robert
and
frances
her
face
of
a
subtle
moving
beauty
more
of
look
than
of
feature
did
not
turn
upon
them
with
a
do
you
remember
it
seemed
to
assume
that
they
remembered
frances
thought
certainly
she
remembers
and
as
much
more
strongly
than
i
as
i
remember
more
strongly
than
robert
it
was
of
a
piece
with
all
that
they
had
talked
of
at
last
with
all
of
us
talk
passes
to
action
frances
dane
drank
her
coffee
all
of
them
in
the
room
seemed
bound
in
a
ribbon
linden
and
drew
also
wherever
they
might
be
in
the
forest
and
stuart
black
in
that
small
dark
room
in
new
york
and
how
many
others
she
did
not
name
them
but
she
knew
they
were
many
in
fact
all
in
a
flash
she
saw
how
to
marget
and
richard
might
appear
not
many
selves
and
binding
ribbon
but
one
self
to
realize
this
was
to
realize
that
for
her
also
there
was
but
one
self
xvii
three
days
after
this
curtin
and
anna
darcy
who
often
walked
together
having
gone
to
the
pass
of
hemlock
cliff
and
tumbling
water
turned
in
the
broken
sunlight
and
shadow
back
to
sweet
rocket
the
maples
of
the
upper
slopes
had
cast
almost
all
their
leaves
but
the
oaks
stood
yet
in
carmine
yesterday
had
fallen
light
rain
earth
lay
moist
and
soil
and
leaf
and
fern
and
moss
sent
out
a
haunting
odor
the
sun
stood
in
scorpio
the
drama
of
the
year
was
on
the
homeward
road
it
saw
ahead
the
archer
and
the
goat
and
the
water
bearer
the
fishes
of
the
great
deep
and
the
ram
that
springing
forth
should
take
once
more
the
road
the
old
road
the
new
road
the
road
now
curtin
and
anna
darcy
spoke
and
now
they
were
silent
it
was
a
blessed
feature
of
this
valley
that
none
need
be
talkative
in
order
to
convey
i
am
at
home
with
you
her
visit
was
approaching
its
end
that
was
what
people
would
say
physical
presence
and
metaphysical
presence
said
curtin
answering
her
thought
physical
and
and
the
generations
to
come
will
find
the
inclusive
word
oh
i
shall
be
here
still
or
will
be
with
me
in
the
city
or
it
will
be
both
at
any
rate
no
desolate
parting
they
passed
from
under
hemlock
and
gray
rock
to
beech
trees
and
a
dappled
path
the
small
river
calmed
itself
and
began
to
flow
through
cultivated
land
gentian
and
made
a
purple
fringe
for
the
way
in
old
romances
one
walked
into
an
inn
or
house
by
the
road
always
saying
is
by
the
road
that
goes
on
as
it
went
before
and
i
presently
again
with
it
but
never
again
as
it
was
before
and
never
again
i
as
before
for
just
there
befalls
the
adventure
that
sets
one
climbing
to
a
new
road
sweet
rocket
vale
opened
before
them
each
time
they
looked
it
grew
fairer
and
that
they
had
begun
to
see
was
because
it
was
not
separated
from
anything
said
anna
darcy
presently
do
you
know
morris
do
you
remember
the
story
of
rhodope
i
used
to
know
almost
all
of
it
by
heart
when
rhodope
is
born
the
countryman
her
father
dreams
and
he
seems
to
himself
to
be
standing
with
the
mother
watching
a
little
blossom
fair
to
see
then
the
day
seemed
changed
to
cloudiness
and
rain
and
the
sweet
flower
whereof
they
were
so
fain
was
grown
a
goodly
sapling
and
they
gazed
wondering
thereat
but
loved
it
nothing
less
but
as
they
looked
a
bright
flame
round
it
blazed
and
hid
it
for
a
space
and
weariness
the
souls
of
both
the
good
folk
did
oppress
and
on
the
earth
they
lay
down
side
by
side
and
unto
them
it
was
as
they
had
died
yet
did
they
know
that
them
hung
the
tree
grown
mighty
on
each
bough
did
hang
crown
sword
or
ship
or
temple
fair
to
see
and
therewithal
a
great
wind
through
it
sang
and
trumpet
blast
there
was
and
armor
rang
amid
that
leafy
world
and
now
and
then
strange
songs
were
sung
in
tongues
of
outland
men
it
is
something
like
that
that
i
feel
for
any
place
and
perhaps
now
it
will
be
so
for
this
and
every
place
it
was
such
a
blossom
and
now
it
is
such
a
tree
all
hangs
therein
peoples
and
nations
things
past
and
things
to
come
when
i
go
away
i
shall
find
it
so
in
any
place
that
is
what
you
will
do
and
i
also
everywhere
that
tree
that
man
that
god
the
vale
widened
at
the
overseer
house
the
sycamore
by
the
river
stretched
in
the
sun
its
great
arms
of
white
and
brown
and
these
and
the
blue
vault
made
a
pattern
a
dozen
turkeys
crossed
the
path
in
a
stately
procession
mary
carter
was
singing
in
the
house
and
little
roger
singing
after
her
as
they
approached
the
tree
and
the
bench
around
it
other
voices
reached
them
then
one
voice
reading
aloud
they
saw
the
two
danes
seated
there
frances
reading
a
letter
so
i
travel
with
you
and
dane
it
was
so
wonderful
it
is
all
around
me
now
i
do
clearly
remember
little
sharp
bits
of
it
but
i
remember
the
whole
it
has
shown
me
a
lot
of
things
i
do
any
longer
mind
living
it
funny
but
father
too
frances
looked
up
as
curtin
and
anna
stepped
under
the
tree
bright
tears
stood
in
her
eyes
she
shook
them
away
and
smiled
at
the
two
it
a
letter
from
the
crippled
boy
i
told
you
about
the
four
walked
back
to
sweet
rocket
house
robert
and
i
have
but
a
week
longer
but
this
place
tempers
the
wind
of
the
whole
year
it
drops
honey
into
winter
days
curtin
asked
robert
dane
forth
from
here
you
go
on
with
the
work
you
are
doing
of
course
that
is
a
department
of
this
but
i
wish
to
work
without
bitterness
or
violence
the
day
shone
about
them
rain
of
the
night
had
brought
into
late
autumn
a
sense
of
spring
spring
and
autumn
seemed
to
touch
across
shortened
winter
the
air
held
a
divine
sweet
freshness
they
were
aware
of
new
life
and
all
objects
of
perception
tossed
back
vigor
and
luster
the
world
renews
the
world
renews
sang
the
river
a
little
later
robert
and
frances
dane
at
their
window
saw
coming
up
from
the
river
a
somewhat
worn
automobile
stopping
before
the
porch
the
driver
and
owner
descended
and
mounted
the
steps
there
an
old
type
said
robert
tall
and
thin
black
clothes
and
soft
hat
low
collar
and
string
tie
white
hair
mustache
and
imperial
look
frances
it
a
picture
once
it
was
the
horse
and
he
swung
himself
down
then
the
carriage
and
at
the
door
he
helped
out
the
ladies
now
it
the
car
he
will
descend
from
the
airship
just
like
that
she
looked
over
his
shoulder
it
old
major
hereward
from
oakwood
he
was
here
four
years
ago
that
time
i
came
alone
he
all
the
past
but
that
car
symbolic
too
he
all
the
past
beginning
to
say
all
my
fighting
i
begin
to
find
myself
with
all
i
care
for
here
in
the
present
perhaps
also
in
the
future
he
beginning
to
think
that
it
may
be
so
with
the
airship
there
with
all
that
he
really
really
cares
for
always
said
that
they
could
get
along
without
me
and
now
i
begin
to
see
that
neither
can
i
get
along
without
them
major
hereward
appeared
at
the
dinner
table
it
seemed
that
he
too
was
a
cousin
of
linden
on
the
other
side
from
the
danes
his
place
was
oakwood
twenty
miles
away
old
major
linden
and
he
had
been
boyhood
friends
he
breathed
knowledge
of
sweet
rocket
in
ancient
days
his
manner
to
marget
was
delightful
though
perhaps
he
still
held
in
comparison
in
a
this
that
sweet
rocket
house
and
the
house
his
manner
to
all
was
delightful
like
old
wine
robert
dane
pondered
that
and
also
frances
words
of
the
morning
like
others
he
could
speak
as
though
the
past
the
present
and
the
future
were
islands
with
nothingness
between
but
truly
he
knew
it
was
not
so
and
he
assumed
that
much
in
those
to
whom
he
spoke
now
he
had
it
in
a
flash
of
vision
how
the
old
wine
and
wheat
how
the
old
strength
of
man
and
woman
did
go
on
all
within
the
whole
flashed
and
changed
but
the
whole
held
all
the
tangential
itself
only
went
so
far
then
returned
and
was
met
and
welcomed
prodigal
he
saw
that
contrary
winds
were
not
so
contrary
after
all
in
the
whole
and
in
the
whole
only
i
am
not
contrary
to
him
nor
he
to
me
in
the
end
one
sail
and
one
wind
and
the
sail
due
to
arrive
and
the
wind
favorable
that
afternoon
major
hereward
walked
over
the
place
with
him
linden
and
curtin
i
came
to
talk
to
you
about
something
richard
but
leave
it
till
night
i
can
always
pull
things
together
better
then
after
the
day
here
the
oak
phil
linden
and
i
planted
the
day
we
heard
of
first
manassas
he
was
eighteen
and
i
was
sixteen
the
next
year
we
both
went
in
they
stood
beneath
the
tree
said
curtin
much
water
has
gone
over
the
wheel
since
then
major
hereward
nodded
much
but
phil
linden
and
i
seem
to
stand
here
together
not
just
of
the
mind
we
were
but
together
many
a
foe
grew
to
be
a
the
bright
day
declined
the
sun
set
in
a
coral
sea
a
crescent
moon
appeared
earth
grew
an
amethyst
the
stars
came
out
brush
was
being
burned
and
wood
smoke
clung
in
the
air
and
there
was
the
multitudinous
chirping
chirping
in
grass
and
bush
of
late
autumn
it
was
almost
november
and
they
built
larger
fires
the
old
parlor
gleamed
it
a
dear
room
a
dear
dear
room
said
major
hereward
i
believe
any
here
can
love
these
portraits
as
i
do
richard
may
look
at
them
often
but
he
broke
off
i
forgot
that
he
is
blind
i
always
forgetting
it
well
he
may
see
the
reality
of
them
richard
entered
and
a
moment
later
marget
it
a
night
of
the
gods
how
the
fire
leaps
they
sat
around
it
anna
darcy
and
curtin
and
drew
and
the
two
danes
and
major
hereward
linden
and
marget
anna
darcy
was
saying
i
went
down
to
mimy
before
supper
the
preacher
is
there
for
the
night
brother
robinson
linden
answered
her
yes
he
will
be
here
presently
he
always
comes
to
us
for
an
hour
or
so
he
a
fine
fellow
rising
he
fetched
frances
violin
what
deep
and
dear
pleasure
you
give
frances
she
played
old
music
and
new
into
which
the
old
glided
until
there
seemed
neither
old
nor
new
but
a
content
very
vast
and
rich
the
wing
of
the
music
lifted
them
music
and
flame
blended
they
sat
in
reverie
and
the
wealth
of
the
world
flowed
circularly
flowed
without
in
the
night
a
lantern
passed
the
windows
there
is
brother
robinson
said
marget
richard
went
out
they
heard
his
voice
in
the
hall
then
he
returned
with
the
negro
preacher
and
zinia
he
said
robinson
friends
all
of
us
the
circle
widened
the
preacher
sat
down
between
linden
and
robert
dane
and
zinia
sat
between
marget
and
frances
play
a
little
longer
frances
the
music
blended
with
the
flame
the
wealth
of
the
world
flowed
flowed
circularly
flowed
the
rev
william
robinson
sat
a
gaunt
dark
figure
in
broadcloth
with
a
rugged
deep
brown
face
when
he
spoke
his
voice
had
unction
like
the
voices
of
most
of
his
people
unction
but
not
too
much
of
it
by
sheer
indomitableness
he
had
gained
a
fair
education
and
he
was
a
good
man
and
a
wise
one
in
her
blue
dress
zinia
sat
beside
marget
land
she
kept
silence
but
her
poise
was
like
her
poise
in
the
dining
room
and
pantry
or
on
the
porch
when
miss
darcy
had
taken
her
breakfasts
there
the
latter
always
thought
of
her
standing
beside
the
pillar
or
in
the
clean
airy
pantry
by
the
jar
of
flowers
and
the
open
always
heard
her
rich
voice
saying
i
like
that
girl
mercy
it
seemed
that
robert
dane
had
met
brother
robinson
before
this
at
sweet
rocket
when
the
violin
was
put
by
the
two
talked
together
a
little
as
folk
might
talk
who
liked
each
other
curtin
from
his
corner
watched
with
interest
sweet
rocket
in
virginia
a
voice
from
somewhere
went
through
his
head
there
is
neither
greek
nor
jew
circumcision
nor
uncircumcision
barbarian
scythian
bond
nor
free
but
christ
is
all
and
in
he
looked
at
major
hereward
and
the
old
man
who
had
stiffened
at
the
robinson
and
the
seating
in
the
circle
about
the
fire
seemed
now
to
rest
at
ease
in
a
brown
study
as
one
who
regards
the
expanse
of
things
miss
darcy
spoke
at
mimy
this
afternoon
you
had
begun
to
tell
me
of
the
building
of
your
church
and
schoolhouse
down
the
river
then
they
called
me
and
i
had
to
go
tell
them
now
brother
said
linden
brother
robinson
told
and
what
he
told
had
humor
and
pathos
and
heroism
there
passed
as
upon
a
screen
the
littles
gathered
that
were
much
to
spare
quaint
efforts
at
money
raising
labor
at
twilight
and
dawn
given
by
laboring
men
the
women
extra
work
and
their
festivals
brother
robinson
was
a
born
raconteur
into
the
sheaf
of
his
homely
narrative
fell
vast
swaths
of
human
effort
and
aspiration
and
brother
linden
helped
us
and
old
morrowcombe
gave
us
five
dollars
a
voice
came
from
the
corner
of
the
hearth
from
major
hereward
like
to
help
you
too
brother
robinson
put
me
down
for
ten
dollars
they
left
the
material
building
of
the
schoolhouse
and
the
church
said
brother
robinson
i
got
something
else
i
want
to
tell
you
i
had
an
experience
and
it
taken
the
heart
out
of
my
bosom
and
crumbled
it
between
its
fingers
and
put
in
a
new
one
i
came
to
sweet
rocket
to
tell
it
to
you
linden
but
i
do
see
anyone
here
that
i
be
afraid
to
tell
it
to
there
is
any
such
said
linden
tell
it
xviii
i
was
going
to
preach
said
brother
robinson
at
piny
hill
church
that
twelve
miles
from
old
lock
where
i
live
i
started
out
saturday
afternoon
to
walk
counting
on
a
lift
or
two
on
the
road
and
i
got
them
i
was
going
to
sleep
at
will
jones
who
works
at
the
mill
on
piny
creek
the
first
lift
i
got
was
from
a
wagon
full
of
hay
going
to
cherry
farm
that
was
two
miles
then
i
walked
three
miles
then
a
ford
came
along
and
said
brother
robinson
are
you
going
as
far
as
llewellyn
i
said
that
i
was
and
farther
and
the
ford
took
me
to
llewellyn
that
did
leave
but
four
miles
to
do
and
that
was
nothing
so
i
was
and
the
leaves
hung
red
and
yellow
and
the
evening
was
powerful
sweet
i
went
through
the
woods
by
the
thessaly
place
i
was
thinking
as
i
was
walking
and
then
just
like
that
linden
thinking
with
words
stopped
my
old
body
stopped
too
i
just
lowered
it
under
a
cedar
tree
and
left
it
there
but
i
myself
went
higher
and
wider
i
was
everywhere
and
all
over
i
was
in
and
through
everything
they
were
just
shapes
in
me
it
was
like
being
air
or
like
that
inside
air
you
told
me
about
called
ether
you
told
me
about
that
but
when
you
told
it
i
had
experienced
and
so
it
was
just
words
now
i
have
experienced
everything
was
right
here
and
now
or
there
and
then
it
did
matter
a
mite
which
the
first
thing
i
felt
was
just
infinite
cleanness
and
coolness
it
was
me
and
it
was
not
me
if
it
was
me
it
was
something
vast
in
me
that
had
got
the
upper
hand
there
was
a
me
a
self
like
a
tired
dirty
child
to
that
me
the
other
was
god
but
god
turning
out
to
be
me
too
i
had
preached
about
god
for
thirty
years
but
i
never
really
tasted
or
touched
god
till
that
day
it
was
cool
and
whole
and
pure
and
bigger
than
the
sky
and
it
forgave
all
my
sins
or
it
saw
clean
through
them
it
saw
a
long
way
and
all
at
once
the
tired
and
dirty
me
was
everybody
else
too
it
was
me
and
it
was
everybody
and
we
were
healed
by
our
god
and
that
was
us
too
us
and
more
than
we
had
ever
dreamed
of
in
that
us
it
healed
with
its
might
and
the
lower
part
understood
and
went
up
i
ca
give
you
a
description
it
was
awe
and
joy
the
little
body
of
william
robinson
could
have
held
it
but
something
bigger
than
that
held
it
and
then
just
as
light
changes
on
the
mountains
here
when
you
are
on
top
of
rock
mountain
maybe
and
see
everything
below
you
and
it
all
there
but
it
got
another
tone
and
you
feel
it
in
a
different
way
just
so
that
cool
awe
and
greatness
changed
a
little
it
was
joy
still
but
now
it
was
friendly
and
natural
it
was
the
whole
earth
looking
like
a
garden
and
all
mine
all
me
and
in
that
me
was
all
i
had
ever
thought
was
you
or
him
or
her
and
all
that
i
had
ever
said
was
it
the
bird
and
the
beast
were
there
the
trees
and
the
grass
and
the
air
and
it
was
lovely
it
was
just
love
and
beauty
he
brushed
his
hand
across
his
eyes
i
ca
tell
you
about
that
beauty
and
we
were
dead
all
was
living
if
you
think
of
the
very
best
moment
you
ever
had
when
you
were
deepest
friends
with
yourself
and
found
that
it
took
in
everybody
it
might
be
something
like
that
a
million
times
over
it
was
innocent
and
wise
and
all
the
times
that
i
ever
thought
i
was
happy
were
just
plain
misery
beside
it
i
could
hold
it
any
more
than
a
young
robin
can
hold
the
flight
he
will
hold
after
a
while
i
reckon
we
all
fledglings
back
i
flopped
toward
william
robinson
here
was
old
virginia
and
the
woods
and
the
road
and
the
hills
and
the
mountains
and
old
lock
and
piny
hill
church
but
just
before
i
settled
in
i
got
for
just
a
minute
this
very
country
and
our
daily
life
in
the
light
and
the
glow
and
the
music
and
the
wonder
all
that
was
fair
kept
in
and
strengthened
and
all
that
was
unfair
just
melted
out
i
knew
then
that
though
we
talk
about
it
we
have
begun
to
love
our
country
it
went
too
into
the
world
god
so
loved
the
world
well
that
vanished
too
i
was
back
i
was
just
the
colored
preacher
william
robinson
i
was
back
but
i
could
remember
i
touched
what
it
like
to
be
god
he
ceased
speaking
and
sat
bent
toward
the
fire
a
little
of
that
luminousness
of
which
he
had
told
seemed
to
show
through
his
flesh
a
dark
translucence
he
said
under
his
breath
children
love
one
another
and
rested
silent
in
communion
with
the
flame
all
we
are
members
one
of
another
feeling
that
said
linden
is
to
feel
as
one
then
the
one
no
longer
counts
as
separate
his
members
he
says
i
am
stillness
held
in
the
old
room
the
fire
gave
it
crimson
and
amber
life
and
warmth
the
canvases
on
the
walls
the
pictured
men
and
women
seemed
major
hereward
spoke
abruptly
where
are
the
dead
where
are
my
brother
dick
my
son
walter
my
mother
and
father
they
are
here
yourself
and
you
shall
find
them
where
is
heaven
it
is
here
the
moment
you
begin
to
perceive
it
you
mean
that
you
perceive
the
dead
richard
yes
do
not
you
the
old
man
stared
he
drew
a
long
breath
never
before
did
i
think
that
i
did
robert
dane
spoke
you
mean
that
as
the
great
consciousness
expands
it
becomes
aware
of
itself
there
too
that
that
realm
becomes
open
yes
discovery
there
is
within
the
grasp
of
our
age
it
is
not
so
far
away
as
many
might
think
as
power
comes
through
the
and
the
do
meet
they
have
met
all
the
time
the
general
recognition
and
use
of
the
fact
is
to
be
strengthened
developed
it
is
not
the
only
recognition
and
use
of
oneness
impending
by
no
means
no
in
every
field
there
is
ripening
corn
how
should
it
not
be
so
major
hereward
voice
came
in
again
spiritual
sense
of
the
dead
i
heard
that
phrase
i
did
know
what
it
meant
do
you
mean
that
when
i
seem
to
myself
to
move
about
in
company
with
dick
when
things
come
into
my
mind
that
he
knew
about
or
that
we
did
together
when
i
seem
as
i
go
on
to
understand
his
character
better
and
better
and
to
see
life
as
he
did
when
he
seems
here
with
me
or
when
we
are
just
happy
together
in
old
places
that
it
and
walter
and
my
mother
and
father
and
helen
and
others
oh
scores
of
others
they
enter
my
mind
and
heart
just
as
though
they
came
in
at
a
door
do
you
mean
that
when
i
think
of
them
suddenly
and
strongly
feel
them
as
it
were
that
are
doing
part
of
it
that
there
intercourse
good
lord
i
thought
it
was
only
myself
i
mean
that
said
linden
it
will
grow
to
be
more
than
that
a
higher
fuller
thing
than
that
the
old
man
rose
face
and
voice
showed
emotion
i
got
what
i
came
for
god
bless
you
richard
and
god
bless
you
too
brother
robinson
oh
we
been
little
marget
i
say
good
night
my
dear
out
of
my
life
goes
fear
and
loneliness
brother
robinson
likewise
with
zinia
rose
to
say
good
night
i
see
you
in
the
morning
said
richard
i
want
to
talk
to
you
about
the
school
that
night
curtin
also
increased
his
sense
of
life
life
that
included
those
that
were
said
to
be
dead
there
had
been
no
repetition
of
the
hour
when
lying
in
the
room
where
now
slept
robert
and
frances
dane
he
had
touched
with
an
inward
sense
that
brother
who
had
fallen
from
the
aeroplane
who
had
been
jostled
out
of
the
body
but
who
lived
surely
the
life
was
not
quite
that
of
the
old
life
though
surely
built
from
that
certainly
curtin
might
not
fully
understand
until
he
too
slipped
the
body
yet
there
was
life
and
living
he
had
not
experienced
that
hour
again
and
he
had
tried
doubting
if
he
had
ever
experienced
it
but
doubt
did
not
prove
to
be
a
going
proposition
memory
smiled
it
down
yet
the
experience
had
not
been
repeated
or
rather
what
had
come
had
diffused
itself
in
the
wide
awakening
of
these
sweet
rocket
weeks
nor
did
its
distinctive
return
there
was
not
the
same
white
keenness
that
which
beamed
about
him
now
was
more
like
that
which
marget
had
spoken
of
on
the
summerhouse
steps
not
one
now
but
many
of
his
dead
not
the
human
only
but
the
flower
and
the
tree
the
bird
and
the
beast
the
scene
the
water
land
and
sky
the
old
and
sweet
is
here
but
chosen
redeemed
gathered
up
understood
become
immortal
and
we
have
had
it
all
the
time
it
has
been
here
all
the
time
just
as
we
had
electricity
and
did
not
know
it
he
fell
asleep
rocked
by
the
waves
of
a
sunny
sea
of
love
and
home
and
kindred
xix
major
linden
spent
two
days
at
sweet
rocket
chiefly
sitting
upon
the
porch
in
the
sunshine
or
walking
about
the
place
sometimes
in
company
sometimes
alone
but
never
curtin
noticed
with
an
old
man
look
of
loneliness
though
he
thought
that
at
times
before
this
major
hereward
would
have
shown
that
loneliness
but
now
there
was
vigor
in
him
vigor
and
interest
and
life
if
they
are
here
living
for
me
as
i
for
them
talking
to
me
and
i
talking
to
them
it
is
the
strangest
thing
what
life
does
when
it
comes
his
laughter
had
a
clear
and
happy
ring
i
had
thought
of
all
kinds
of
solutions
and
here
it
is
the
needle
threaded
while
i
was
still
looking
for
it
in
the
haystack
he
stood
beneath
the
oak
he
had
planted
almost
sixty
years
ago
phil
is
here
trying
it
phil
when
i
said
fancy
or
just
wilmot
hereward
talking
to
himself
when
he
met
linden
on
the
porch
he
said
richard
if
it
so
with
those
folk
whom
we
so
promptly
insisted
had
any
reality
in
them
is
it
so
all
over
when
i
pondering
bob
who
in
england
or
when
thinking
of
nothing
in
particular
and
in
he
walks
into
mind
and
affection
yes
it
is
part
of
the
same
truth
it
all
rests
on
the
oneness
of
being
that
is
why
you
must
in
some
wise
grasp
that
oneness
first
a
time
will
come
where
there
will
be
no
saying
brother
dick
or
in
england
because
they
and
wilmot
hereward
and
all
others
will
have
advanced
beyond
all
such
divisions
but
on
the
road
there
you
will
meet
many
a
fair
power
the
old
man
went
the
next
morning
back
to
oakwood
in
his
battered
car
he
went
alone
and
not
alone
with
a
peaceful
face
in
the
afternoon
anna
and
curtin
drew
and
the
two
danes
walked
down
the
river
in
among
the
partly
forested
partly
grassy
hills
that
here
closed
the
valley
indian
summer
had
now
stolen
over
the
land
the
air
hung
smoky
amethyst
and
still
as
still
no
motion
was
in
the
fallen
leaves
the
birds
sailed
stilly
by
the
stubble
fields
dreamed
the
river
sang
low
wood
smoke
clung
in
the
nostril
turning
coming
homeward
the
brick
house
and
yellowed
pillars
stood
pictured
they
passed
through
the
orchard
and
by
a
small
cider
mill
zinia
on
the
back
porch
poured
for
each
out
of
an
amber
pitcher
an
amber
glassful
said
drew
and
lifted
the
glass
curtin
caught
from
memory
the
answering
phrase
a
shaft
of
wonder
like
a
gleam
of
light
touched
them
all
with
strange
fingers
something
trembled
in
the
air
if
it
said
aught
it
said
so
earth
begins
to
poetry
drew
set
down
the
cup
with
a
sharp
clear
sound
life
everlasting
life
he
said
i
see
it
now
we
have
always
lived
again
evening
in
the
old
parlor
the
fire
and
music
tam
lying
beside
linden
marget
seated
by
anna
darcy
robert
dane
spoke
this
finding
ourselves
in
all
and
all
in
us
this
lifting
the
all
into
a
mighty
i
this
is
it
behind
the
slowly
accelerating
movements
of
the
ages
behind
all
efforts
for
freedom
for
knowledge
for
interchange
and
intercourse
swifter
and
swifter
subtler
and
subtler
intercourse
this
is
it
yes
behind
a
hundred
shapes
of
dawn
effort
does
not
cease
no
but
effort
too
is
finer
and
far
more
powerful
you
act
now
from
within
upon
the
within
to
touch
through
and
through
that
we
are
one
hercules
labor
is
in
it
yet
it
is
done
and
to
be
done
find
me
if
you
can
an
individual
who
has
not
some
dim
perception
of
it
or
who
is
not
in
some
wise
acting
toward
it
even
the
most
unpromising
look
and
you
will
see
it
is
so
tremendous
that
finding
it
runs
through
every
fiber
we
can
cut
out
no
pattern
but
we
move
from
light
to
light
from
love
to
love
in
her
room
that
night
when
she
had
put
out
the
lamp
anna
darcy
lying
in
bed
watched
the
firelight
on
wall
and
ceiling
a
cricket
chirped
she
could
hear
the
river
her
visit
to
sweet
rocket
was
ending
only
it
will
never
end
it
is
immortal
within
me
she
saw
how
all
life
interlocked
how
shock
to
one
was
taken
up
by
the
whole
how
joy
to
one
thrilled
through
all
what
we
call
space
is
being
what
we
call
time
is
our
own
story
our
colored
toned
lastingness
give
and
take
forever
and
forever
forever
and
forever
find
lovely
things
to
give
and
from
the
other
side
of
us
take
lovely
things
lovelier
and
lovelier
know
thyself
know
thyself
know
thyself
ye
do
it
unto
one
the
least
of
these
ye
do
it
unto
me
all
we
made
one
the
walls
of
the
room
disappeared
anna
darcy
a
slight
worn
teaching
woman
sixty
years
old
vanished
or
altered
there
was
wide
life
land
and
sea
deep
life
that
did
not
talk
in
births
and
deaths
lofty
life
that
said
better
than
this
wave
even
shall
you
know
it
was
strength
it
was
peace
it
was
wisdom
and
balm
across
the
hall
robert
dane
lay
thinking
in
his
youth
he
had
the
passion
of
a
shelley
for
a
regenerate
world
older
the
vision
dulled
and
yet
he
worked
on
doggedly
heroically
one
with
thousands
of
others
breaking
and
making
a
road
for
the
feet
of
coming
man
he
worked
heroically
never
sparing
himself
a
devoted
life
sometimes
the
gleam
shone
fair
before
him
oftener
mists
made
it
faint
sometimes
he
lost
it
then
it
shone
again
he
worked
on
lying
here
at
sweet
rocket
his
youth
came
back
but
higher
fuller
wiser
he
saw
what
might
be
done
what
was
doing
he
saw
the
interrelated
roads
and
the
travelers
upon
them
the
hosts
of
travelers
a
vision
came
to
him
in
the
night
his
body
lay
very
still
but
he
himself
saw
clearly
a
great
thing
there
was
a
city
that
was
country
also
and
sea
and
land
and
sky
that
was
a
world
harmonious
great
not
a
dead
thing
not
unintellectual
but
living
living
with
a
vast
fervor
and
beauty
and
interest
and
knowledge
throwing
out
even
it
might
be
silver
lines
toward
a
world
yet
more
light
more
fervent
more
living
but
it
was
there
all
that
he
could
now
image
of
body
and
spirit
mind
and
soul
desire
he
saw
like
a
pale
film
another
city
that
was
pale
and
sorrowful
to
this
and
he
saw
that
city
as
it
were
send
out
itself
by
rivers
and
seas
and
roads
thousands
and
thousands
of
paths
upon
a
journey
to
the
other
there
was
hardly
a
point
truly
he
thought
there
was
not
any
point
that
did
not
travel
so
many
living
beings
so
many
ships
or
rafts
caravans
or
solitary
travelers
to
that
desired
haven
all
going
some
ahead
some
behind
but
all
going
the
pale
and
sorrowful
city
was
moving
into
that
other
and
brightening
as
it
moved
that
other
was
drawing
it
steadily
steadily
he
felt
it
like
a
loadstone
he
felt
it
like
a
mother
calling
home
the
vision
passed
but
there
was
left
assurance
he
lay
still
in
the
starry
night
the
mind
kept
up
an
underhumming
with
words
like
reintegration
superconsciousness
but
the
spirit
dealt
only
with
the
bliss
of
a
great
coming
to
itself
he
slept
at
last
and
his
sleep
was
dreamless
and
profoundly
renewing
xx
it
is
the
flowering

it
is
the
music

go
to
it

every
moment
and
incident
and
encounter
of
the
day
you
read
and
it
is
behind
the
words

think
and

smiles

they
were
walking
in
the
orchard
beneath
the
apple
trees

this
morning

heavy
frost

blue
crystal

the
cool
of
mountain
water
it
was
the
day
when
anna
darcy
must
leave

rocket
after

the
phaeton
and
marget

her
to
alder

of
the
place

lot
they
walked
up
the
river
to
the
overseer
house
where
they
were
made
welcome
by
mary
carter
and
small
roger
and
by
old
morrowcombe
who
was
staying
over
from
sunday
which
was
yesterday
he
said
much
as
mancy
had
said
i
sorry

going
but
thar

ai
going
in
the
old
harsh
ways
marget
sitting
beside
him
on
the
step
of
the
porch
rested
her
arm
upon
his
knee
her
brown
slender
hand
touched
his
great
horny
one
grandfather
morrowcombe
she
said
he
answered
her
i
see
you
as
a
marget
and
i
see
you
as
a
woman
in
sweet
rocket
valley
and
i
see
you
as
something
that
stands
above
child
and
woman
it
any
more
big
than
it
is
it
puzzling
to
find
words
but
when
i
look
at
you
and
think
of
you
i
seem
to
hear
the
air
stirring
over
the
whole
world
all
kinds
of
things
that
i
had
forgotten
and
all
kinds
of
things
that
i
have
read
she
and
anna
sat
for
five
minutes
under
the
sycamore
by
the
water
returning
then
to
sweet
rocket
they
walked
in
the
garden
that
was
making
ready
for
winter
as
it
happened
cliff
came
this
day
down
mountain
to
borrow
some
sugar
she
sat
on
the
steps
of
the
back
porch
in
the
violet
light
of
november
howdy
she
said
to
miss
darcy
glad
you
stayed
on
when
i
come
here
i
want
to
stay
on
too
but
thar
i
take
the
memory
of
it
up
to
my
home
you
would
think
how
often
thar
i
here
too
she
had
a
braided
rug
to
sell
and
marget
bought
it
long
wrinkled
hand
put
the
money
in
her
pocket
times
is
any
miss
marget
marget
laughed
oh
the
poor
old
times
it
startled
anna
darcy
too
so
joyous
and
and
lilting
was
the
voice
cliff
stared
at
her
the
mountain
woman
face
was
not
what
one
would
call
a
cheerful
one
whoever
was
behind
it
was
caught
in
a
network
of
fine
anxious
lines
now
these
held
for
a
perceptible
moment
then
faded
as
though
the
twine
were
mist
that
one
immortally
youthful
and
insouciant
looked
forth
as
it
had
looked
from
marget
sun
came
out
over
meadow
plain
and
hill
and
cliff
laughed
i
reckon
you
right
miss
marget
you
generally
are
i
reckon
we
seen
so
much
that
we
can
afford
to
take
it
tranquil
which
ai
to
say
that
we
either
or
keerless
she
spoke
to
anna
you
remember
my
tellin
you
about
that
feeling
i
had
i
had
it
full
again
but
i
caught
glimpses
of
it
maybe
in
the
day
maybe
in
the
night
i
know
the
minute
when
anything
like
it
comes
my
way
when
you
had
a
feeling
like
that
all
your
life
set
to
feeling
it
again
but
marget
had
taken
it
joyously
when
cliff
had
said
and
gone
mountainward
the
two
crossing
the
pleasant
porch
entered
the
house
they
walked
from
room
to
room
anna
consciousness
gathering
each
any
time
you
may
feel
me
here
we
shall
feel
you
here
all
the
time
they
stood
in
the
study
against
the
broad
mantelshelf
at
first
when
i
thought
of
this
room
i
thought
linden
study
but
it
is
of
and
for
and
to
both
of
you
ah
yes
to
both
she
seemed
to
give
forth
light
anna
thought
is
it
only
the
sun
shining
on
her
later
in
her
own
room
all
packing
done
dressed
for
her
journey
anna
went
and
sat
beside
the
window
as
she
had
sat
the
first
evening
at
sweet
rocket
she
still
heard
mimy
singing
she
still
saw
the
garden
though
it
was
dreaming
now
of
spring
i
have
been
here
only
a
month
but
in
it
i
have
had
years
and
years
the
quiet
room
filled
with
a
sunny
stillness
an
eternal
assurance
again
as
on
that
first
evening
the
mountains
were
here
and
the
wind
of
the
sea
was
here
love
and
wisdom
and
power
were
here
the
boy
jim
brought
daniel
and
the
phaeton
to
the
door
below
marget
came
for
her
and
they
went
down
and
through
the
hall
to
the
porch
to
find
there
linden
and
curtin
and
robert
and
frances
and
drew
and
zinia
and
mimy
and
mancy
and
tam
across
the
river
at
the
edge
of
the
wood
marget
checked
daniel
so
that
anna
might
look
back
and
see
the
house
again
the
house
and
the
trees
and
the
hills
and
the
holding
arms
of
the
mountains
but
you
are
to
come
again
said
marget
never
part
and
come
again
yes
oh
yes
the
wheels
turned
and
went
on
upon
the
alder
road
they
entered
the
forest
old
forest
great
trees
that
sloughed
their
leaves
again
and
again
and
again
through
centuries
past
number
sloughed
their
leaves
sloughed
their
old
bodies
made
soil
and
stood
upon
it
and
builded
higher
behind
and
in
and
through
every
stem
and
leaf
rose
the
subjective
forest
and
behind
and
in
and
through
the
whole
the
ideal
the
spiritual
forest
the
divine
forest
around
and
onward
went
the
wheels
on
the
leafy
road
anna
sat
beside
marget
the
two
spoke
little
having
now
no
great
need
of
words
the
light
came
down
between
bare
branches
far
and
near
branch
and
blue
air
made
a
marvel
of
lacework
against
this
pines
and
hemlocks
stood
like
pyramids
and
pillars
song
and
twitter
of
a
month
ago
was
not
now
the
birds
go
south
the
birds
go
south
said
marget
but
there
are
enough
left
for
winter
company
there
is
a
bluebird
on
yonder
bough
round
went
the
wheels
making
hardly
a
sound
the
forest
hung
still
so
still
for
one
moment
to
anna
darcy
it
all
went
away
it
was
illusion
the
forest
indian
summer
this
day
of
our
lord
the
phaeton
and
daniel
sweet
rocket
and
alder
and
new
york
marget
land
and
anna
darcy
what
was
left
was
fullness
of
being
did
it
choose
to
analyze
itself
it
might
be
into
power
wisdom
and
bliss
the
revealing
flash
went
as
it
came
ere
one
could
say
it
lightens
again
marget
land
and
anna
darcy
daniel
and
the
phaeton
the
forest
sweet
rocket
and
alder
and
the
train
to
be
met
but
each
time
the
sheath
thinned
and
there
was
left
stronger
light
the
train
came
the
friends
embraced
anna
darcy
looked
from
window
at
marget
and
then
at
alder
the
fields
and
hills
and
rivers
and
mountains
the
train
roared
through
a
tunnel
and
when
it
emerged
the
scenery
was
changed
there
were
fields
and
mountains
but
not
these
fields
and
mountains
and
yet
they
run
into
those
there
is
no
impassable
wall
nor
aching
gulf
there
are
the
finest
gradations
marget
and
daniel
and
the
phaeton
went
homeward
along
the
alder
road
xxi
november
rains
wrapped
sweet
rocket
november
winds
rocked
and
bent
the
trees
the
world
was
gray
or
with
streakings
indoors
they
built
larger
fires
it
was
five
days
after
anna
departure
unless
the
storm
held
him
curtin
was
going
on
the
morrow
in
january
his
profession
would
take
him
abroad
to
the
nearer
east
he
could
not
tell
when
he
would
be
returning
but
sweet
rocket
goes
with
me
just
as
all
the
east
and
you
flow
here
what
kind
of
a
general
world
are
we
coming
into
linden
what
kind
of
a
political
social
economic
world
i
believe
that
as
to
much
of
it
robert
and
frances
are
far
seeing
in
the
large
those
changes
are
upon
us
and
in
the
large
they
are
for
the
better
they
are
built
into
the
road
we
are
going
i
agree
i
welcome
but
i
would
see
more
completely
if
i
could
linden
in
the
cane
chair
by
the
study
window
seemed
to
pay
attention
to
the
storm
at
last
he
spoke
i
can
not
see
in
detail
i
think
there
will
be
a
great
simplification
power
out
of
a
thousand
tortuous
channels
mingling
running
broad
and
deep
there
are
signs
on
every
side
the
old
banks
crumble
the
great
sea
lifts
other
continents
i
see
everywhere
how
we
are
seeking
yes
the
seeker
finds
the
finder
seeks
on
seeks
farther
the
great
ages
are
ever
the
seekers
you
would
say
it
is
a
great
age
yes
a
very
great
one
who
is
not
in
some
way
aware
of
it
this
friction
of
opinion
on
the
top
is
but
the
wildness
of
the
outermost
leaves
as
the
strong
wind
blows
and
wherever
i
go
i
shall
find
the
seeking
and
the
greatness
the
world
is
one
said
linden
the
storm
continued
sweet
rocket
had
early
supper
zinia
and
mimy
with
raincoats
and
a
huge
umbrella
went
by
the
swaying
chanting
orchard
to
their
own
fireside
to
sarah
and
julia
and
jim
and
just
so
the
danes
and
curtin
and
drew
linden
and
marget
sat
or
moved
about
in
the
old
sweet
rocket
parlor
they
might
watch
the
storm
from
the
windows
or
they
might
sit
by
the
fire
the
great
wind
blew
through
sweet
rocket
valley
they
heard
the
stream
rushing
and
the
trees
had
a
voice
as
though
they
had
taken
foot
out
of
ground
and
were
now
a
herd
the
rain
was
driven
against
the
panes
and
the
wind
hurled
dead
leaves
with
the
rain
wall
and
roof
and
glass
shut
out
the
physical
rain
but
the
psychical
man
cognized
it
far
and
near
rain
since
the
world
began
and
the
fire
also
and
the
warm
room
and
they
in
company
listening
to
the
storm
the
momentary
outlines
shifted
there
fell
a
sense
of
having
done
this
times
and
times
and
times
a
sense
of
hut
and
cave
so
often
so
long
in
so
many
lands
that
there
was
a
feel
of
eternity
about
it
rain
and
the
cave
and
the
fire
and
the
inner
man
still
busied
with
his
destiny
there
was
something
that
awed
in
the
perception
that
ran
from
one
to
another
that
held
them
in
a
swift
shimmering
band
how
old
how
old
how
long
have
we
done
this
the
rhythm
of
the
storm
the
rhythm
of
the
room
the
rhythm
of
the
fire
passed
into
a
vast
still
sense
of
ordered
movement
of
old
and
now
and
everywhere
and
all
time
until
we
return
above
time
and
place
and
division
is
healed
they
felt
a
lightness
a
detachment
the
spirit
soared
with
the
mind
and
made
it
look
there
is
the
natural
man
and
there
is
the
spiritual
man
that
last
finds
himself
in
all
selves
and
all
selves
in
him
there
is
the
spiritual
man
and
there
is
the
divine
man
who
works
with
power
both
are
words
of
inclusion
it
is
to
leave
the
old
small
i
for
the
spiritual
i
and
it
is
to
transcend
the
last
and
enter
that
which
is
above
then
is
left
the
shrunken
pond
for
the
ocean
only
we
say
it
upside
down
it
is
the
ocean
that
overflows
and
drinks
up
the
pond
when
god
enters
life
there
will
still
be
said
i
otherwise
still
pond
and
ocean
still
separation
who
shall
lose
his
life
here
shall
find
it
but
never
sink
to
thinking
that
it
is
what
in
the
past
we
have
meant
when
we
said
i
when
god
enters
how
shall
he
not
say
i
but
it
is
the
ocean
now
that
speaks
the
pond
is
gone
they
sat
still
and
the
fire
played
and
leaped
through
the
night
the
rain
beat
and
the
wind
blew
but
at
dawn
it
cleared
there
was
wreckage
about
the
world
but
life
laughed
and
took
her
wreckage
and
built
with
it
anew
valley
hills
and
mountains
gleamed
like
precious
stones
navies
of
clouds
rode
for
a
while
then
melted
into
the
deep
azure
the
upper
sea
hung
so
calm
and
clear
that
down
through
it
to
the
earth
bottom
ran
light
that
seemed
intenser
than
the
light
of
every
day
curtin
said
and
went
marget
and
linden
drove
him
to
alder
the
river
ran
swollen
the
road
lay
deep
in
leaves
few
leaves
now
on
the
trees
the
trees
stood
still
in
vast
ranks
they
seemed
to
be
holding
something
to
be
turning
it
over
in
mind
there
flashed
across
curtin
who
lifts
all
lifts
yes
said
marget
beside
him
as
though
he
had
spoken
it
was
what
he
carried
with
him
from
this
valley
linden
and
marget
drove
home
through
the
wood
how
still
it
is
barring
foot
and
wheel
on
the
wet
leaves
you
would
say
there
was
no
stir
we
are
passing
pine
trees
how
fragrant
a
bluebird
is
watching
us
from
a
maple
now
here
is
the
great
beech
it
holds
its
leaves
though
they
are
brown
and
curled
upon
themselves
like
cocoons
the
ground
underneath
is
clean
and
brown
a
grapevine
goes
over
and
up
with
those
young
trees
there
are
yet
bunches
of
grapes
and
they
hang
so
still
there
are
brown
loops
for
swings
for
all
the
forest
children
whether
they
be
indians
or
dryads
and
fauns
i
see
them
said
linden
all
the
graceful
tawny
forest
children
here
is
the
oak
glade
with
the
grass
yet
green
far
down
it
to
where
hangs
the
purple
curtain
the
outstanding
great
roots
glisten
and
the
moss
holds
the
water
drops
you
see
a
long
way
yonder
is
tree
trunk
and
stone
light
and
shadow
that
looks
like
a
hermit
cell
it
is
an
alley
for
the
whole
middle
ages
to
come
riding
down
for
a
paladin
to
come
riding
down
the
red
cross
knight
or
guyon
or
galahad
or
parsifal
or
it
might
be
robin
hood
in
lincoln
green
i
see
here
are
green
brier
and
red
dogwood
berries
and
with
dull
gold
fingers
can
you
hear
the
water
yes
three
silver
threads
of
it
like
a
lute
the
day
is
a
castle
and
a
church
the
day
is
a
city
and
a
star
now
we
pass
the
great
rock
and
the
two
hemlocks
like
cathedral
spires
here
are
the
little
oaks
and
there
is
a
guess
of
crimson
about
them
yet
the
birch
and
the
hickory
and
the
tall
oaks
and
the
tops
are
far
and
fine
and
melt
into
the
sky
they
came
down
to
the
river
and
crossed
the
light
washes
the
pillars
the
cedars
are
little
earth
clouds
the
arch
of
the
sky
has
none
it
springs
clear
blue
music
of
home
yes
music
of
home
after
supper
with
robert
and
frances
and
drew
they
watched
the
fire
anna
sends
the
city
to
us
and
curtin
sends
the
rush
of
the
train
and
the
flying
scenery
as
we
send
this
place
and
this
mood
and
this
thought
to
the
city
and
the
train
the
violin
bow
drew
across
the
strings
frances
played
and
love
and
release
filled
the
ancient
room
the
world
entered
into
harmony
the
next
day
rose
gray
pearl
linden
and
drew
went
with
the
woodcutters
marget
sat
at
her
typewriter
in
the
study
robert
and
frances
took
a
long
walk
three
days
and
they
too
must
go
cityward
now
they
walked
by
the
alder
road
and
at
the
great
pine
took
the
rock
mountain
trail
the
pearly
light
filled
the
forest
like
a
water
all
sound
lay
subdued
when
a
stone
rolled
underfoot
it
was
not
loudly
when
a
branch
broke
it
was
with
a
slow
deliberate
musing
voice
when
they
saw
a
wild
thing
the
wild
thing
had
no
motion
of
flight
but
pottered
stilly
on
upon
its
business
of
the
time
we
are
far
away
we
have
crossed
to
another
land
it
is
as
though
we
died
and
this
is
the
quiet
ground
where
we
take
our
reckoning
before
we
find
another
busy
world
oh
a
busy
world
in
each
of
us
and
a
quiet
land
they
rested
upon
a
bowlder
half
sunken
in
brown
leaves
there
is
a
touch
of
eternity
about
this
day
yet
in
five
days
how
busy
a
world
for
you
and
me
yet
i
love
that
as
i
love
this
how
happy
that
we
are
so
rich
they
sat
still
on
the
gray
bowlder
in
the
gray
wood
in
the
air
minutes
passed
a
bird
flew
across
the
path
a
gray
squirrel
ran
up
an
oak
something
is
coming
down
the
trail
the
something
proved
to
be
a
man
on
horseback
the
intervening
boughs
branches
twigs
made
him
to
be
seen
like
a
horseman
behind
a
great
window
filled
with
small
leaded
panes
he
came
close
and
seeing
them
drew
rein
good
day
good
day
from
sweet
rocket
yes
from
sweet
rocket
do
i
speak
to
linden
my
name
is
smith
malcolm
smith
from
the
reserve
on
rock
mountain
robert
gave
their
names
smith
said
have
you
ever
seen
a
stiller
day
it
is
one
of
the
still
days
that
set
you
on
new
action
i
thought
i
would
ride
over
i
want
to
see
drew
and
there
is
something
else
after
a
minute
or
two
he
addressed
himself
again
to
the
path
i
go
on
as
i
have
only
this
afternoon
and
i
must
get
back
to
camp
he
made
no
doubt
it
might
be
noticed
of
the
hospitality
of
sweet
rocket
i
shall
see
you
again
yes
we
shall
turn
presently
they
watched
him
along
the
trail
until
as
the
figure
had
entered
so
it
vanished
from
the
leaded
window
they
sat
awhile
longer
in
the
world
and
then
they
rose
and
followed
the
horseman
down
to
sweet
rocket
xxii
malcolm
smith
and
drew
had
their
talk
walking
by
the
river
in
the
still
november
dusk
drew
said
i
was
glad
to
be
on
rock
mountain
and
after
a
few
months
if
you
will
have
me
i
am
going
there
again
but
i
am
glad
that
i
came
here
i
am
growing
to
see
that
it
is
not
here
nor
there
camp
on
mountain
or
sweet
rocket
that
a
man
goes
to
find
himself
but
yet
there
are
helpers
there
a
principle
of
induction
do
you
think
sir
those
who
find
start
a
wave
of
finding
the
wave
caught
them
too
there
is
any
first
or
last
turning
they
saw
fire
gleaming
through
the
window
he
says
that
we
and
when
he
says
that
he
means
the
whole
of
us
when
he
says
it
is
the
other
word
for
it
is
the
whole
of
the
many
are
growing
fast
sometimes
he
says
evolving
life
sometimes
the
principle
of
integration
or
the
great
synthesis
he
may
say
humanity
awake
or
going
home
or
realizing
deity
or
liberation
in
god
or
becoming
real
or
fulfilling
want
or
recollection
or
union
or
the
eternal
including
or
love
at
last
he
seems
to
think
that
almost
any
phrase
will
answer
if
you
know
the
thing
zinia
bell
rang
from
the
porch
behind
them
they
went
in
to
the
pleasant
supper
table
set
with
wholesome
delicate
bread
and
fragrant
coffee
cottage
cheese
and
baked
apples
and
cream
the
table
talk
was
merry
this
evening
after
the
dreamy
day
supper
over
all
walked
out
to
see
the
night
and
found
it
clearing
with
river
banks
of
clouds
and
stars
between
like
lit
craft
sailing
sailing
the
air
breathed
exquisitely
mild
warm
as
early
october
let
us
sit
by
the
river
and
watch
awhile
they
took
capes
and
coats
and
went
down
to
where
before
the
cedars
was
placed
a
long
bench
sitting
here
though
no
entire
constellation
was
visible
yet
they
pieced
out
the
figures
they
sat
in
silence
watching
the
ships
of
the
universe
at
last
said
the
visitor
i
have
been
thinking
a
good
deal
about
you
down
here
by
this
river
and
about
drew
and
of
two
or
three
things
curtin
said
when
he
was
at
camp
so
i
came
down
i
have
been
thinking
a
good
deal
look
there
is
pleiades
a
magic
island
in
a
sea
i
have
had
my
inklings
of
the
way
currents
arise
in
this
world
let
grant
that
it
is
a
universe
of
thought
and
will
and
feeling
and
that
from
ignoring
as
much
as
we
could
that
fact
and
then
from
wondering
about
it
and
then
from
in
some
wise
earning
it
we
begin
to
be
it
just
said
linden
well
the
other
continued
once
when
i
was
recovering
from
an
illness
i
found
or
was
found
by
and
i
do
suppose
the
expressions
matter
no
they
are
distinctions
without
a
difference
once
then
i
walked
into
a
state
of
consciousness
that
transcended
the
level
that
i
had
thought
was
the
true
level
i
was
there
for
it
might
be
five
seconds
of
our
time
but
though
again
in
mass
we
parted
there
remained
an
influence
like
one
of
those
rivers
up
there
the
world
has
never
since
been
just
the
old
world
but
the
main
experience
did
not
repeat
itself
though
there
have
been
times
when
i
have
met
the
shadows
of
it
until
the
other
night
but
i
will
come
to
that
presently
though
it
was
not
repeated
i
have
known
ever
since
that
there
is
a
consciousness
as
much
above
our
usual
one
as
the
latter
is
above
the
ape
a
consciousness
that
it
is
profoundly
desirable
to
reach
before
that
moment
i
was
like
almost
any
european
of
say
during
it
for
that
one
minute
i
was
in
america
after
it
though
i
returned
to
europe
i
could
say
there
is
america
yes
just
but
i
had
fallen
out
of
america
and
i
could
never
get
quite
back
though
i
often
tried
and
then
the
other
night
he
broke
off
and
seemed
to
ponder
the
sky
i
rode
over
from
rock
mountain
because
the
other
night
i
had
not
that
first
experience
again
but
one
that
was
again
in
america
new
america
from
what
i
have
heard
i
felt
certain
that
this
place
knows
these
experiences
i
wanted
to
compare
and
be
confirmed
so
i
rode
over
he
was
speaking
to
linden
i
had
meant
to
ask
to
talk
with
you
alone
but
i
see
that
there
is
nothing
here
that
jars
or
makes
it
difficult
it
a
good
place
this
bench
with
the
river
sounding
and
the
clouds
and
the
stars
there
is
just
ourself
here
i
was
coming
down
from
the
top
of
rock
i
had
had
a
still
twenty
minutes
there
watching
the
sunset
i
had
thought
of
nothing
in
particular
only
gathered
rest
i
was
halfway
down
when
this
torrent
rose
and
overtook
me
i
stood
still
i
remember
a
pine
tree
and
beyond
that
a
great
wash
of
sky
but
i
i
was
in
the
torrent
that
now
seemed
ocean
and
now
seemed
air
and
now
was
fire
the
combination
called
malcolm
smith
was
gone
into
that
like
rain
into
sea
or
a
candle
flame
into
sun
and
yet
and
that
was
the
miracle
of
it
there
was
an
i
only
it
was
oceanic
only
it
was
the
sun
it
held
in
a
sheaf
it
sucked
out
pith
and
marrow
of
all
the
small
in
creation
and
soared
and
rang
an
but
what
are
words
if
i
could
give
you
that
sense
perhaps
you
do
as
long
ago
we
developed
gesture
in
order
faintly
to
understand
and
be
at
one
and
then
developed
speech
so
now
the
will
within
is
propelling
and
the
will
within
is
receiving
these
mightier
waves
i
feel
what
you
would
give
go
on
if
i
could
find
the
words
i
passed
into
a
subtle
consciousness
that
went
everywhere
and
all
our
old
time
became
space
to
it
there
was
motion
as
of
all
the
winds
of
the
world
brought
into
one
current
only
nor
air
nor
fire
is
swift
enough
vast
enough
and
yet
you
would
say
all
the
movements
of
our
world
penetrated
understood
furthered
all
the
honey
fields
all
the
bees
all
the
hives
and
valhalla
and
olympus
and
paradise
where
the
honey
is
eaten
and
it
is
all
a
figure
but
what
will
you
have
i
can
but
stammer
i
have
seen
home
he
rose
and
walked
up
and
down
beneath
the
cedars
i
talk
about
it
so
calmly
and
yet
all
that
i
ever
believed
or
hoped
all
that
i
ever
thought
or
felt
or
did
is
babyhood
to
that
i
am
patient
and
that
astonishes
me
i
who
am
back
at
malcolm
smith
you
are
not
wholly
back
the
rising
pendulum
swings
but
now
a
great
part
of
you
is
above
the
old
lower
range
and
at
the
last
not
anticipation
but
reality
not
light
of
home
but
home
the
river
sounded
the
stars
shone
in
the
upper
rivers
with
the
cloud
banks
the
clouds
made
rivers
but
the
clouds
dissolved
there
were
no
more
rivers
but
ocean
but
space
but
the
eternal
fire
it
is
all
i
have
to
tell
said
smith
it
sank
with
long
reverberations
and
there
was
the
pine
tree
and
the
camp
below
and
malcolm
smith
they
sat
in
silence
at
last
said
linden
america
is
a
term
of
vastness
they
who
adventured
there
and
arrived
found
all
manner
of
experience
but
all
in
america
they
sailed
in
many
crafts
and
yet
in
the
end
all
were
as
one
ship
all
being
for
america
they
landed
north
or
south
in
varying
climes
they
stayed
by
the
sea
or
went
toward
the
mountains
but
all
in
america
they
met
with
great
variety
in
adventure
the
land
being
so
vast
and
so
rich
in
might
but
all
was
american
adventure
so
it
is
i
hold
with
the
new
america
the
new
world
now
lighting
the
horizon
it
resounds
and
flames
thus
to
this
one
and
thus
to
the
other
one
but
it
resounds
and
flames
the
great
symphony
takes
in
all
the
music
feel
it
as
you
can
know
it
as
you
can
in
proportion
as
you
draw
the
breath
of
the
all
comparisons
become
odious
you
have
access
as
i
have
access
enter
by
the
door
of
your
inner
nature
a
new
man
is
born
yes
everywhere
including
and
transcending
men
men
fading
into
man
men
left
behind
man
moving
toward
his
full
consciousness
what
in
prophecy
we
have
called
christ
they
watched
the
clouds
and
the
stars
and
they
saw
each
of
them
a
new
country
that
was
fair
and
strong
and
keen
and
glowing
at
last
they
rose
and
went
back
to
the
house
and
by
the
fire
listened
to
the
violin
xxiii
day
rose
in
sapphire
tranquil
pure
still
and
sunny
white
smoke
going
straight
up
from
morning
fires
malcolm
smith
mounting
his
horse
turned
again
to
his
mountain
sweet
rocket
bade
him
but
linden
and
marget
said
all
who
come
together
in
this
consciousness
part
no
more
i
believe
that
he
rode
away
and
in
the
afternoon
was
back
with
his
work
but
the
inner
eye
might
view
between
mountain
and
sweet
rocket
a
shimmering
ethereal
highway
a
nerve
as
it
were
thrown
from
space
to
space
joining
and
making
one
robert
and
frances
and
marget
on
this
last
day
of
the
danes
visit
walked
to
the
hill
with
the
solitary
tree
atop
the
sapphire
day
continued
quiet
and
sunny
the
air
being
of
an
extreme
fineness
charged
with
light
far
and
near
the
mountains
made
a
cup
of
amethyst
fields
and
hillsides
at
hand
were
a
lighted
umber
they
saw
long
rows
of
stacked
corn
and
in
the
meadows
hayricks
beyond
the
orchard
they
made
out
the
steep
roof
of
the
great
barn
there
were
corn
and
wheat
for
the
mill
there
were
stored
apples
in
the
wood
below
them
they
heard
the
woodman
ax
i
can
see
said
robert
dane
i
can
see
that
humanity
is
mastering
its
own
organism
i
see
that
it
is
lifting
toward
unitary
consciousness
here
now
in
this
present
year
as
in
past
years
each
year
now
with
greater
momentum
reaction
and
recoil
of
course
but
back
again
and
farther
everywhere
shows
the
swift
all
over
all
through
america
europe
asia
africa
australia
and
the
islands
of
the
sea
the
revolutions
of
our
day
are
woven
of
it
we
are
leaving
separation
and
partialness
fortress
and
dungeon
yes
all
our
rush
into
the
one
all
our
vortices
approach
with
a
fearful
joy
the
great
vortex
the
correlation
will
be
established
the
summation
made
we
go
to
join
and
strengthen
the
ancient
heavens
the
ancient
of
days
draws
and
redeems
and
fuses
and
ones
another
layer
of
his
being
faster
and
faster
our
age
begins
to
see
what
is
happening
the
language
men
use
to
describe
it
does
not
so
much
matter
the
poet
names
it
life
beauty
and
joy
the
scientific
man
says
knowledge
and
use
the
philosopher
says
energy
and
substance
in
conscious
union
the
hindu
says
the
our
peoples
say
god
all
one
they
came
to
the
hilltop
and
stood
to
look
about
them
there
is
such
joy
went
on
marget
pain
and
pleasure
outgrown
now
blooms
the
joy
may
endure
for
a
night
but
joy
cometh
in
the
morning
the
being
found
and
the
finding
one
after
another
lays
hand
upon
that
world
clings
braces
himself
draws
himself
up
and
over
and
finds
the
manna
lying
around
him
joy
wisdom
and
power
and
the
taste
of
them
but
begun
possession
still
to
be
possessed
forever
and
forever
they
sat
beneath
the
tree
and
all
around
sprang
the
valley
and
the
mountains
and
virginia
and
the
world
alive
deathlessly
alive
the
valley
and
the
mountains
virginia
and
the
world
frances
spoke
i
know
a
woman
who
speaks
in
the
terms
of
the
east
is
it
the
principle
of
sensibility
the
buddhic
plane
yes
atma
is
yet
to
arrive
what
we
see
is
the
light
before
his
face
when
he
fully
comes
that
is
the
day
of
the
lord
what
all
work
has
been
toward
all
toil
all
hoping
as
atma
rises
in
us
as
christ
rises
in
us
comes
newer
and
richer
life
fuller
and
fuller
inner
powers
and
principalities
thrones
and
dominions
and
their
objective
garments
but
when
we
are
the
lord
i
know
not
there
is
light
there
that
is
as
darkness
to
us
yet
the
exquisite
valley
heightened
its
values
throughout
became
richer
the
mountains
around
hung
in
the
eye
like
the
delectable
mountains
if
one
grows
all
things
and
all
places
grow
with
that
one
inevitably
so
the
wealth
is
for
all
the
new
consciousness
that
we
feel
is
a
pale
film
to
what
will
be
yes
a
borderland
the
islands
fringing
the
new
world
but
such
as
it
is
it
wipes
out
the
old
blind
scattered
little
consciousnesses
to
what
shall
be
felt
and
shall
be
known
it
is
the
one
leaf
of
green
it
is
the
olive
leaf
that
the
dove
brings
but
before
us
are
enormous
growth
strange
and
fair
adventure
work
joy
love
through
the
air
they
felt
the
ether
through
the
sunlight
they
felt
the
great
sun
light
and
warmth
came
to
them
from
the
sun
behind
the
sun
it
touched
it
passed
but
each
time
it
came
they
strengthened
that
night
by
the
fire
they
sat
in
silence
that
was
full
and
rich
and
understanding
night
here
at
sweet
rocket
just
richard
and
marget
and
drew
and
all
the
rest
of
us
the
next
day
dawned
and
still
it
was
indian
summer
robert
and
frances
went
from
place
to
place
as
had
gone
curtin
and
anna
darcy
saying
farewell
we
wish
and
hope
to
bring
our
bodies
here
again
next
year
but
if
that
is
not
done
still
still
still
we
shall
have
sweet
rocket
you
have
access
now
to
all
places
and
times
and
peoples
you
are
through
the
gate
you
two
all
your
good
dreams
now
will
come
true
if
not
in
this
way
then
in
that
every
dream
that
does
no
injury
to
the
whole
richard
and
marget
daniel
and
the
phaeton
took
them
to
alder
the
still
forest
was
clothed
in
purple
for
much
of
the
way
silence
held
within
the
phaeton
as
without
but
it
was
the
silence
that
anna
darcy
had
early
noted
it
was
rhythmic
it
was
thronged
it
was
fused
and
made
into
the
richest
solitude
but
such
a
tide
as
moving
seems
asleep
too
full
for
sound
or
foam
when
that
which
drew
from
out
the
boundless
deep
turns
again
home
now
and
then
they
spoke
once
robert
said
abruptly
and
all
the
effort
of
the
world
is
to
stand
and
grow
in
grace
just
all
the
effort
everywhere
whether
it
be
stone
or
plant
or
animal
or
man
or
and
where
the
emerging
character
is
so
mighty
none
is
to
despise
his
brother
path
or
rate
of
speed
once
it
was
his
own
everything
has
been
and
is
our
own
work
but
who
hates
or
despises
halts
and
weakens
the
effort
but
work
yes
steadily
in
all
realms
thy
hand
findeth
to
do
do
with
thy
might
what
thy
judgment
findeth
to
do
the
other
name
of
lubber
land
was
good
enough
they
came
to
alder
with
its
churches
and
sere
gardens
lying
in
violet
light
here
was
the
little
station
in
a
few
moments
they
heard
the
train
frances
and
robert
looked
through
the
car
window
the
platform
had
men
women
and
children
upon
it
two
or
three
arriving
travelers
found
friends
to
meet
them
there
were
the
workers
about
the
station
and
the
loafers
with
country
folk
and
village
folk
brought
by
some
business
and
in
the
throng
richard
linden
and
marget
land
just
the
usual
village
station
then
all
of
it
sprang
into
light
into
music
into
significance
into
importance
the
train
moved
there
was
a
cry
of
come
again
all
seemed
to
enter
into
it
to
cry
it
out
the
houses
went
by
the
village
street
the
hills
the
river
and
all
all
and
this
train
upon
which
they
found
themselves
had
color
and
music
and
significance
and
importance
the
i
that
says
of
every
living
thing
is
i
says
it
and
means
it
and
understands
it
and
proceeds
to
live
from
it
says
it
of
the
total
objective
and
so
takes
the
objective
up
into
the
subject
that
i
is
over
the
verge
of
the
old
into
the
new
the
hills
went
by
the
river
gleamed
marget
and
richard
traveled
homeward
through
the
purple
forest
they
hardly
used
the
outer
voice
the
blind
man
sat
with
a
smile
upon
his
lips
as
though
he
saw
with
such
a
face
as
could
only
have
come
from
much
seeing
the
woman
too
sat
still
the
body
relaxed
the
spirit
gleaming
in
the
soul
daniel
drew
them
through
the
forest
nor
did
daniel
either
lack
some
sense
of
growth
dim
belief
in
a
higher
world
dim
will
to
reach
it
below
daniel
the
forest
felt
that
and
below
the
forest
the
rock
the
utter
stream
of
pilgrims
the
end
