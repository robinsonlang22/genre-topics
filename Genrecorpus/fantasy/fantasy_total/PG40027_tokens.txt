the
woman

in
the
doorway
of
the
ramshackle
shanty

were
cupped
at
her
mouth
the
wind
blew
loose
whitish
blond
wisps
of
hair
around
her
face
and
slashed
the
faded
blue
dress
into
the
uncorseted
bulk
of
her
body
benny

call
echoed
through
the
still
evening
her
eyes
staring
straight
before

down
the
slope
in

of
the
house

sight
of
something
blue
and
antiquatedly
military

deep

rigid
in

he
slouched
heavily
out

where

was
the
set
look
pressed
on
her
face
automatically
her
hands
reached
out
among
the
dishes
pulling
them
toward
her
outside
the
boy
sank
down
on
the
step
it
was
getting
dark
there
were
shadows
along
the
ground
blue
shadows
in
the
graying
skies
one
star
shone
brilliantly
beyond
the
summit
of
a
hill
the
full
moon
grew
yellow
in
front
of
him
was
the
slope
of
corn
field
and
in
the
center
of
it
the
dim
military
figure
standing
waist
deep
in
the
corn
his
eyes
fixed
themselves
to
it
ole
uniform
with
a
stick
into
it
he
whispered
the
words
very
low
still
standing
there
still
the
same
wooden
attitude
of
it
his
same
cunning
watching
of
it
there
was
a
wind
he
knew
it
was
going
over
his
face
he
could
feel
the
cool
of
the
wind
across
his
moistened
lips
he
took
a
deep
breath
down
there
in
the
shivering
corn
field
standing
in
the
dark
blue
shadows
the
dim
figure
had
quivered
an
arm
moved
swaying
to
and
fro
the
other
arm
began
swaying
swaying
a
tremor
ran
through
it
once
it
pivoted
the
head
shook
slowly
from
side
to
side
the
arms
rose
and
fell
and
rose
again
the
head
came
up
and
down
and
rocked
a
bit
to
either
side
i
here
he
muttered
involuntarily
here
the
arms
were
tossing
and
stretching
he
thought
the
head
faced
in
his
direction
the
wind
had
died
out
the
arms
went
down
and
came
up
and
reached
benny
the
woman
seated
herself
on
the
step
at
his
side
look
he
mumbled
look
he
pointed
his
hand
at
the
dim
figure
shifting
restlessly
in
the
quiet
corn
field
her
eyes
followed
after
his
oh

itself

his
eyes
were
still
riveted
on
those
arms
that
came
up
and
down
up
and
down
and
reached
it

stuttered

down

slope
at
the
dim
military
figure
standing
rigid
and
waist
deep
in
the
corn
field
the
woman
gave
a
quick
sigh
of
relief
for
several
moments
they
were
silent
from
somewhere
in
the
distance
came
the
harsh
discordant
sound
of
bull
frogs
croaking
out
in
the
night
a
dog
bayed
at
the
golden
full
moon
climbing
up
over
the
hills
a
bird
circled
between
sky
and
earth
hovering
above
the
corn
field
they
saw
its
slow
descent
and
then
for
a
second
they
caught
the
startled
whir
of
its
wings
as
it
flew
blindly
into
the
night
that
ole
scarecrow
she
muttered
he
whispered
when
it
starts
its
moving
like

some
day

footsteps
moving
slowly
a
window
was
thrown
open
she
looked
up
to
see
him
leaning
far
out
over
the
sill
her
eyes
went
down
the
slope
of
the
corn
field
her
right
hand
curled
itself
into
a
fist
ole
scarecrow
she
half
laughed
she
waited
there
until
she
saw
the
boy
draw
away
from
the
window
she
went
into
the
house
and
bolted
the
door
behind
her
then
she
went
up
the
narrow
steps
that
night
she
lay
awake
for
a
long
time
the
heat
had
grown
intense
she
found
herself
tossing
from
side
to
side
of
the
small
bed
the
window
shade
had
stuck
at
the
top
of
the
window
the
moonlight
trickled
into
the
room
she
could
see
the
patch
of
the
skies
when
she
sat
up
she
saw
the
round
ball
of
the
moon
she
must
have
dozed
because
she
woke
with
a
start
she
felt
that
she
had
had
a
fearful
evil
dream
the
horror
of
it
clung
to
her
the
room
was
like
an
oven
she
thought
the
walls
were
coming
together
and
the
ceiling
pressing
down
her
body
was
covered
with
sweat
she
forced
herself
wide
awake
she
made
herself
get
out
of
the
bed
she
stood
for
a
second
uncertain
then
she
went
to
the
window
not
a
breath
of
air
stirring
the
moon
was
high
in
the
sky
she
looked
out
across
the
hills
down
there
to
the
left
the
acres
of
potatoes
potatoes
were
paying
she
counted
on
a
big
harvest
to
the
right
the
wheat
only
the
second
year
for
those
five
fields
she
knew
that
she
had
done
well
with
them
she
thought
with
a
smile
running
over
her
lips
back
to
the
time
when
less
than
half
of
the
place
had
been
under
cultivation
she
remembered
her
dream
of
getting
the
whole
of
her
farm
in
work
she
and
the
boy
had
made
good
she
thought
of
that
with
savage
complacency
it
had
been
a
struggle
a
bitter
hard
fight
from
the
beginning
but
she
had
made
good
with
her
farm
and
there
down
the
slope
just
in
front
of
the
house
the
corn
field
and
in
the
center
of
it
standing
waist
deep
in
the
corn
the
antiquated
military
figure
the
smile
slid
from
her
mouth
the
suffocating
heat
was
terrific
not
a
breath
of
air
suddenly
she
began
to
shake
from
head
to
foot
her
eyes
wide
and
staring
were
fixed
on
the
corn
field
her
eyes
were
held
to
the
figure
standing
in
the
ghostly
corn
moving
an
arm
swayed
swayed
to
and
fro
backwards
and
forwards
backwards
the
other
arm
swaying
a
tremor
ran
through
it
once
it
pivoted
the
head
shook
slowly
from
side
to
side
the
arms
rose
and
fell
and
rose
again
the
head
came
up
and
down
and
rocked
a
bit
to
either
side
dancing
she
whispered
stupidly
dancing
she
thought
she
could
not
breathe
she
had
never
felt
such
oppressive
heat
the
arms
were
tossing
and
stretching
she
could
not
take
her
eyes
from
it
and
then
she
saw
both
arms
reach
out
and
slowly
very
slowly
she
saw
the
hands
of
them
beckoning
in
the
stillness
of
the
room
next
to
her
she
thought
she
heard
a
crash
she
listened
intently
her
eyes
stuck
to
those
reaching
arms
and
the
hands
of
them
that
beckoned
and
beckoned
benny
she
murmured
benny
silence
she
could
not
think
it
was
his
talk
that
had
done
this
benny
talk
he
had
said
something
about
it
walking
out
if
it
should
come
out
moving
all
over
like
that
if
its
feet
should
start
if
they
should
of
a
sudden
begin
to
shuffle
shuffle
out
of
the
cornfield
but
benny
was
awake
he
could
see
it
thank
gawd
if
only
something
would
hold
it
if
only
it
would
stop
gawd
nothing
stirring
out
there
in
the
haunting
night
nothing
moving
nothing
but
the
figure
standing
waist
deep
in
the
corn
field
and
even
as
she
looked
the
rigid
military
figure
grew
still
still
now
but
for
those
slow
beckoning
hands
a
tremendous
dizziness
came
over
her
she
closed
her
eyes
for
a
second
and
then
she
stumbled
back
to
the
bed
she
lay
there
panting
she
pulled
the
sheets
up
across
her
face
her
shaking
fingers
working
the
tops
of
them
into
a
hard
ball
she
stuffed
it
between
her
chattering
teeth
whatever
happened
benny
must
hear
her
she
must
waken
benny
thank
heaven
benny
was
asleep
benny
must
never
know
how
out
there
in
the
whitened
night
the
hands
of
the
figure
slowly
and
unceasingly
beckoned
and
beckoned
the
sight
of
those
reaching
arms
stayed
before
her
when
hours
later
she
fell
asleep
she
still
saw
the
motioning
hands
it
was
morning
when
she
wakened
the
sun
streamed
into
the
room
she
went
to
the
door
and
opened
it
benny
she
called
oh
benny
there
was
no
answer
benny
she
called
again
get
on
up
it
late
benny
the
house
was
quiet
she
half
dressed
herself
and
went
into
his
room
the
bed
had
been
slept
in
she
saw
that
at
a
glance
his
clothes
were
not
there
down
in
the
field
because
she
forgotten
to
wake
him
in
a
sudden
stunning
flash
she
remembered
the
crash
she
had
heard
it
took
her
a
long
while
to
get
to
the
little
closet
behind
the
bed
before
she
opened
it
she
knew
it
would
be
empty
the
door
creaked
open
his
one
hat
and
coat
were
gone
she
had
known
that
he
had
seen
those
two
reaching
arms
he
had
seen
those
two
hands
that
had
slowly
very
slowly
beckoned
she
went
to
the
window
her
eyes
staring
straight
before
her
down
the
slope
in
front
of
the
house
caught
sight
of
something
blue
and
antiquatedly
military
standing
waist
deep
and
rigid
in
the
corn
field
you
ole
scarecrow
she
whimpered
why
you
standing
there
she
sobbed
what
you
standing
still
for
mutter
schwegel
he
was
tremendously
disappointed
the
house
was
empty
he
had
thought
it
looked
uninhabited
from
the
outside
it
made
him
a
bit
dreary
to
have
his
people
away
like
this
that
uncertain
feeling
came
over
him
again
the
uncertain
feeling
never
quite
left
him
of
late
he
was
conscious
of
it
most
of
the
time
it
formed
an
intangible
background
to
all
his
other
thought
he
decided
he
would
go
down
to
the
lodge
presently
he
was
certain
to
find
bennet
at
the
lodge
and
bennet
wife
and
bennet
three
children
he
grinned
as
he
thought
of
bennet
chasing
his
children
out
of
his
gardens
he
could
imagine
the
old
gardener
gladness
at
his
homecoming
going
quickly
up
the
last
flight
of
stairs
he
could
see
that
the
door
of
his
room
stood
ajar
he
wondered
at
the
yellow
glow
of
light
trickling
in
a
long
narrow
stream
out
into
the
dark
of
the
hall
he
went
rushing
along
the
corridor
he
pushed
the
door
open
the
same
old
room
the
familiar
faded
wall
paper
the
high
mahogany
bed
the
hunting
print
he
had
so
cherished
on
the
wall
facing
him
the
table
just
as
he
had
left
it
the
books
piled
in
neat
stacks
on
its
polished
surface
the
lamp
standing
lighted
among
the
books
the
two
big
arm
chairs
he
took
a
deep
breath
of
surprise
some
one
was
seated
in
the
chair
facing
from
him
he
saw
the
top
of
a
man
head
he
had
a
dim
recognition
of
feet
sprawling
from
under
the
chair
on
either
arm
of
the
chair
rested
a
man
hand
there
was
something
he
knew
about
those
hands
the
prominent
knuckles
the
long
well
made
fingers
the
heavy
silver
signet
ring
on
the
smallest
finger
of
the
left
hand
was
a
ring
he
had
often
seen
he
crossed
the
room
otto
standing
there
in
front
of
kurz
he
wondered
at
the
change
in
him
he
looked
so
much
older
there
was
no
trace
left
of
the
boyishness
which
he
had
always
associated
with
otto
kurz
there
were
gray
streaks
in
heavy
hair
gray
at
the
temples
of
the
wide
forehead
gray
behind
the
ears
the
mustache
and
beard
were
threaded
with
grayed
hairs
he
was
astonished
to
find
otto
kurz
in
his
room
otto
i
had
no
idea
that
you
would
be
here
he
could
not
understand
the
rigid
attitude
of
the
man
great
body
the
set
mobility
of
the
man
large
hewn
features
he
moved
a
bit
so
as
to
stand
directly
in
the
line
of
those
fixed
staring
eyes
he
wanted
to
interrupt
the
wooden
expression
of
those
eyes
otto
it
was
good
of
you
to
come
kurz
eyes
raised
themselves
to
meet
his
eyes
he
quivered
at
the
look
in
kurz
eyes
my
god
what
is
it
the
glazed
deadened
eyes
with
the
live
dumbed
suffering
behind
them
widened
ach
charlie
what
happened
otto
i
do
not
know
i
was
waiting
charlie
for
you
to
come
good
old
otto
he
saw
kurz
hand
with
the
heavy
silver
signet
ring
on
the
smallest
finger
go
up
trembling
to
his
beard
it
was
the
old
familiar
gesture
good
did
you
say
good
of
me
charlie
yes
yes
he
insisted
eagerly
of
course
it
was
good
of
you
to
come
and
meet
me
i
had
to
come
for
he
a
second
he
wondered
but
how
did
you
know
who
told
you
i
only
just
got
here
no
one
knew
how
could
you
have
known

was
coming
he
heard
kurz
sigh
a
long
sigh
that
quavered
at
the
end
i
ach
how
i
hoped
that
i
would
come
that
you
would
come
charlie
he
could
not
fathom
the
look
in
kurz
eyes
he
had
never
seen
a
look
like
that
in
those
eyes
he
thought
that
it
was
not
a
human
look
see
here
otto
what
is
it
kurz
made
a
little
appealing
gesture
with
his
long
trembling
hands
later
i
will
try
to
tell
you
later
kurz
nodded
his
great
shaggy
head
up
and
down
how
did
you
come
in
here
charlie
he
was
surprised
at
the
question
how
why
with
my
latch
key
of
course
he
glanced
over
at
the
windows
the
blinds
were
up
he
could
see
the
dark
pressing
against
the
glass
pressing
tightly
so
that
it
spread
he
started
for
the
window
kurz
voice
stopped
him
and
your
family

have
then
seen
your
family

he
smiled
no

i
have
seen
no

could
not
bring
myself

go
before
any
one
there

an
old
man

was
going
down
the
hall

waited
till
he
passed
he
must
have
come
to
light
your
lamp
well
old
otto
they
not
here
i
hunted
all
through
the
house
for

i
rather

must
have
gone
down
to
surrey
they
taken
the
servants
with
them
after
a
bit
we
walk
over
to
the
lodge
and
ask

up
here
to

look
at

old
room
i
go
down
and
ask
bennet
presently
a
quick
moan
escaped
through
kurz
set
lips
a
sudden
thought
flashed
to
him
you
otto
how
did
you
get
in
here
with
them
all
away
with
the
servants
gone
he
saw
the
muscles
of

face
twitch
horribly

little
time

perplexed
frown

and
the
sometime
now
eh
otto

together
again
old
otto

pretty
good
pals
back
there
at
your
university
what
a
time

eyes
stole
away
from

face
later
i

of
mutter
schwegel
too
and
the
talks
we
used
to
have
the
nightlong
talks

settled
the
affairs
of
the
world
nicely
in
those
days
did
we
old
otto
the
affairs
of
the
world
and
old
mutter
schwegel
coming
in
to
put
out
the
light
and
then
standing
there
to
hear
what
we
had
to
say
of
life
and
of
death
of
life
and
of
death
and
not
being
able
to
tear
herself
away
to
go
to
bed
she
thought
we
were
wise
otto
she
used
to
drink
in
every
word
we
said
and
then
scold
us
for
staying
up
all
night
old
mutter
schwegel
i
thought
of
her
often
kurz
made
a
movement
toward
him
and
of
me
charlie
you
had
thought
of
me
i
say
rather
many
a
time
when
they
called
me
back
from
the
university
even
after
i
went
out
to
france
i
thought
of
you
his
mind
was
muddled
a
bit
he
put
it
down
to
the
excitement
of
his
coming
home
that
uncertain
feeling
came
over
him
again
quite
strongly
but
he
had
thought
of
otto
he
remembered
he
had
thought
of
otto
a
lot
and
what
was
it
you
thought
of
me
charlie
it
came
back
to
him
that
there
had
been
one
time
when
he
had
thought
of
otto
particularly
that
one
time
when
something
tremendous
had
happened
to
him
he
could
not
quite
think
what
he
knew
he
had
been
glad
when
he
thought
of
otto
because
he
had
been
spared
inflicting
the
thing
on
him
he
could
not
get
it
clear
he
avoided
looking
at
kurz
why
why
i
wondered
what
you
were
doing
all
that
sort
of
thing
you
know
what
i
mean
yes
i
know
i
did
go
into
the
army
charlie
it
was
that
sort
of
thing
you
meant
charlie
he
felt
himself
start
i
was
afraid
you
would
do
that
he
said
involuntarily
yes
i
too
was
afraid
kurz
voice
was
low
you
afraid
ach
charlie
you
know
it
the
fear
it
was
not
for
myself
he
walked
over
to
the
window
he
stood
there
looking
down
at
the
huge
boxwood
hedges
looming
in
thick
gray
bulks
up
from
the
smudging
reach
of
the
heavily
matted
shadows
he
turned
you
funked
meeting
me
in
war
ach
god
forbid
that
i
should
meet
you
in

heavy
with
silence

the
power
of

no
other
knowledge
than
my
reasoning
i
do
not
know
now
i
do
not
know
where
i

or

the
maddened
urge
of
kurz
words
struck
him

otto
he
said
it
reassuringly
here
with
me
in
my
room
in
england
you
with
me
otto
yes
with
you
and
then
beneath
his
breath
he
whispered
where
are
you
he
caught
the
smothered
insistence
of
that
last
sentence
he
smiled
forcing
his
lips
to
smile
standing
right
in
front
of
you
old
man
waiting
for
you
to
say
what
you
came
to
kurz
interrupted
him
i
had
to
come

felt
that
i
must
come
i
came
charlie
i
got
myself
here
charlie
quite
right
otto
i
want
you
to
know
first
that
i
thought
of
you
that
i
was
as
you
say
you
were
afraid
i
might
in
some
way
injure
you
i
want
to
tell
you
that
first
good
old
sentimental
otto
sentimental
ach
i
am
not
sentimental
but
i
do
not
think
you
can
understand
how
much
you
were
to
me
back
there
at
the
university
i
do
not
think
you
yourself
knew
how
much
you
joyed
in
things
how
happy
your
kind
of
thought
made
you
he
laughed
i
always
managed
to
have
a
rather
corking
time
of
it
he
admitted
you
loved
everything
so
kurz
went
on
at
night
when
we
talked
it
was
you
who
believed
in
what
you
said
it
was
you
who
saw
so
clearly
how
well
all
things
of
life
were
meant
it
was
always
i
who
questioned
but
i
say
old
otto
your
mind
was
so
quick
so
brilliant
you
could
pick
flaws
where
i
never
knew
they
existed
it
was
you
who
had
so
much
of
faith
charlie
how
we
did
talk
he
said
it
to
himself
talk
and
talk
until
old
mutter
schwegel
who
was
so
keen
for
us
grew
tired
of
listening
and
came
and
turned
out
the
lamp
and
how
you
spoke
ever
of
your
beliefs
kurz
voice
was
hoarse
it
was
so
easy
for
you
to
know
you
never
questioned
you
believed
it
ended
there
with
your
belief
you
were
so
near
to
what
you
thought
it
was
a
part
of
you
i
i
stood
away
from
all
things
and
from
myself
i
would
tell
you
that
the
mind
should
reason
i
stayed
outside
with
my
criticism
while
you
ach
charlie
how
you
did
know
and
how
you
laughed
at
me
for
that
but
now
i
do
not
laugh
kurz
protested
with
wearied
eagerness
now
i
come
to
you
i
ask
you
if
you
know
those
things
now
what
things
otto
the
things
of
life
the
things
of
death
i
know
what
i
always
knew
he
said
slowly
i
know
that
life
is
meant
to
live
fully
and
understandingly
and
that
death
is
meant
to
live
on
fully
and
understandingly
and
you
do
understand
i
understand
that
always
you
would
not
be
afraid
of
what
of
death
no
he
stared
out
of
the
window
the
dense
opaque
shadows
pressing
down
on
the
garden
the
shadows
hanging
loose
and
thick
on
the
high
boxwood
hedges
the
dark
smooth
night
sky
and
suddenly
a
faint
tremor
ran
through
him
from
head
to
foot
he
pressed
his
face
close
to
the
glass
his
hands
went
up
screening
a
small
space
for
his
eyes
in
the
still
block
of
shadows
in
the
black
mass
of
them
he
had
seen
something
something
had
moved
against
the
quiet
clumping
shadows
i
say
he
whispered
there
some
one
coming
up
through
the
garden
yes
yes
they
were
silent
for
a
long
time
once
he
looked
at
kurz
huddled
in
the
armchair
his
face
white
and
drawn
his
eyes
staring
before
him
he
thought
he
heard
footsteps
coming
softly
up
the
stairs
footsteps
that
came
lightly
and
hesitated
and
then
came
on
again
charlie
kurz
stammered
charlie
he
felt
that
some
one
was
standing
in
the
open
doorway
he
turned
his
eyes
took
in
the
well
known
figure
the
sweet
face
with
its
red
cheeks
and
its
framing
white
hair
the
short
body
the
blue
eyes
that
were
fixed
on
him
mutter
schwegel
he
shouted
kurz
leaped
to
his
feet
what
he
started
for
the
door
mutter
schwegel
who
would
have
thought
of
your
coming
here
it
has
been
a
long
time
i
say
but
i
am
glad
stop
kurz
voice
thundered
behind
him
he
wheeled
to
look
at
kurz
kurz
eyes
were
riveted
on
the
woman
standing
in
the
doorway
are
you
glad
to
see
mutter
schwegel
he
asked
when
we
been
talking
of
her
all
night
kurz
was
muttering
to
himself
mutter
schwegel
kurz
mumbled
mutter
schwegel
it
is
that
i
wanted
to
tell
you
about
mutter
schwegel
it
is
as
i
thought
it
is
ach
it
is
then
that
way
with
us
he
felt
that
the
woman
was
coming
into
the
room
he
turned
and
looked
at
her
mutter
schwegel
is
dead
kurz
stammered
he
saw
that
the
old
woman
smiled
she
is
dead
dead
kurz
mumbled
he
smiled
back
at
her
dead
kurz
voice
droned
shaking
he
saw
the
old
woman
go
to
the
table
he
and
kurz
watched
her
take
the
lamp
up
in
her
hands
he
and
kurz
saw
her
fingers
fumbling
at
the
wick
kurz
quivering
face
stood
out
in
the
lamplight
the
old
woman
was
smiling
quietly
they
saw
her
try
to
put
out
the
light
the
lamp
still
burned
is
dead
kurz
voice
quavered
and
then
it
screamed
dead
he
shrieked
we
are
all
of
us
dead
that
uncertain
feeling
came
over
him
and
suddenly
it
went
quite
from
him
haunted
he
lived
quite
alone
in
the
stone
built
shanty
perched
on
the
highest
pinnacle
of
the
great
sun
bleached
chalk
cliffs
all
about
him
as
far
as
the
eye
could
reach
lay
the
flat
salt
marshes
with
their
dank
yellowed
grasses
against
the
inland
horizon
three
gaunt
trees
reared
themselves
from
the
monotonously
even
soil
overhead
the
cloud
splotched
blue
gray
sky
and
below
him
the
changing
motion
pulled
current
swirling
depths
of
the
blue
green
sea
and
at
all
times
of
the
day
and
the
night
the
wild
whirring
of
the
sea
gulls
wings
and
the
uncanny
inhuman
piercing
sound
of
their
shrieking
he
had
lived
there
since
that
day
when
the
fisherman
had
pulled
him
half
drowned
out
of
the
sea
he
could
never
remember
where
he
had
come
from
or
what
had
happened
all
that
he
ever
knew
was
that
far
out
by
the
nets
in
the
early
morning
they
had
come
upon
him
and
had
brought
him
in
to
shore
naturally
the
fishermen
had
questioned
him
but
his
vagueness
his
absolute
lack
of
belief
that
he
had
ever
been
anything
before
they
had
snatched
him
from
the
waters
had
frightened
them
so
that
since
that
day
they
had
left
him
severely
alone
fishing
folk
have
strange
superstitious
ideas
about
certain
things
he
had
borne
the
full
weight
of
their
credulous
awe
perhaps
because
he
himself
thought
as
they
thought
that
he
was
something
come
from
the
sea
and
of
the
sea
and
always
belonging
to
the
sea
he
had
built
himself
the
stone
shanty
upon
the
highest
pinnacle
of
those
waste
grown
chalk
cliffs
and
he
had
stayed
on
and
on
year
in
and
year
out
close
there
to
the
sea
in
winter
for
a
livelihood
he
made
baskets
from
the
reeds
he
had
picked
in
the
swamps
about
him
in
the
summer
he
sold
the
vegetables
he
grew
in
the
tiny
truck
garden
behind
his
house
somehow
he
managed
to
eke
out
a
living
the
fishing
folk
in
the
small
village
at
the
foot
of
the
cliffs
saw
him
come
and
go
along
their
narrow
streets
morose
and
taciturn
he
never
spoke
to
any
of
them
unless
he
had
to
they
in
their
turn
avoided
him
with
their
habitual
superstitious
uneasiness
he
went
to
and
fro
between
his
shanty
and
the
village
store
when
the
need
arose
the
rest
of
the
time
he
sat
in
front
of
his
iron
bolted
door
staring
and
staring
down
at
the
sea
daybreak
and
noon
evening
and
night
he
sat
there
when
the
sky
above
was
tinged
with
the
first
streaking
colors
of
the
dawn
he
watched
the
ghostly
gray
expanse
of
the
ocean
when
the
sun
was
high
in
the
heavens
he
looked
steadily
at
the
spotted
swells
of
the
waves
when
the
shadows
began
to
creep
up
from
the
earth
he
stared
at
the
greater
blackness
that
swam
in
glistening
undulating
darkness
to
him
from
across
the
water
and
at
night
his
eyes
strained
through
the
fitful
gloom
at
the
pitchy
turbulent
sea
it
was
like
that
in
all
kinds
of
weather
the
spring
tides
with
their
quick
changes
from
calm
to
storm
and
the
slender
silver
crescent
of
the
new
moon
hanging
just
above
the
horizon
the
long
summer
laziness
of
the
green
ocean
with
its
later
gigantic
moons
and
the
wide
yellow
streak
of
phosphorescent
light
that
streamed
in
moving
ripples
to
him
the
chill
lashing
spray
in
autumn
the
seething
breadth
of
it
in
winter
when
the
blackness
of
the
low
night
skies
and
the
darkness
of
the
high
tides
were
as
one
menacing
roaring
turmoil
churning
itself
into
white
spumed
frenzy
it
always
held
him
he
was
a
man
of
one
idea
the
sea
he
was
a
man
who
drew
his
life
from
one
source
the
sea
it
had
taken
his
body
and
had
tried
to
drown
it
the
sea
had
for
that
short
time
caught
and
gripped
his
soul
the
slimy
wet
touch
of
it
was
seared
into
him
it
fascinated
him
it
kept
him
near
it
so
that
he
could
not
have
gotten
away
from
it
had
he
had
the
courage
to
want
to
get
away
it
kept
him
there
as
though
he
belonged
to
it
as
though
it
knew
he
belonged
to
it
and
knew
that
he
knew
it
and
always
and
ever
the
sea
haunted
him
the
fishing
men
coming
home
late
at
night
across
the
water
had
grown
used
to
steering
their
course
by
the
unreal
light
that
trickled
out
to
them
from
the
shanty
on
the
top
of
the
cliffs
and
in
the
dawn
when
they
pushed
their
smacks
off
from
the
long
hard
beach
to
sail
out
to
the
nets
they
knew
that
from
the
high
precipices
above
them
the
man
was
watching
and
outwardly
they
laughed
at
him
even
when
in
their
hearts
they
feared
the
thing
they
thought
he
was
they
could
not
understand
him
they
who
made
their
living
from
the
sea
could
not
understand
how
he
could
be
content
to
live
the
way
he
was
living
they
could
not
have
known
that
he
would
infinitely
rather
have
died
than
to
have
taken
one
thing
from
out
the
sea
from
which
he
had
already
filched
his
soul
his
enslavement
by
it
had
made
him
understand
it
a
lot
better
than
they
understood
it
and
so
he
lived
the
stupid
hypnotized
life
of
one
who
is
held
so
enchained
and
cowed
that
he
could
not
think
for
himself
or
of
himself
until
that
day
when
he
first
met
sally
it
was
a
sunny
day
late
in
the
autumn
that
he
stood
in
front
of
the
weather
beaten
wooden
hut
of
the
village
store
his
arms
filled
with
baskets
and
as
he
stood
there
sally
walsh
came
from
the
store
and
out
into
the
street
she
had
seen
the
man
a
hundred
times
but
she
had
never
seen
him
so
close
she
stopped
short
and
stared
quite
frankly
at
the
bigness
of
him
at
the
heavily
matted
hair
clinging
so
damply
to
his
forehead
and
at
the
white
face
so
strange
to
her
beside
the
faces
she
had
always
seen
it
was
when
quite
suddenly
he
looked
at
her
and
she
saw
the
odd
blue
green
sea
colored
eyes
of
him
that
she
started
to
hurry
on
she
had
gotten
half
way
down
the
street
when
he
overtook
her
want
anything
of
me
he
asked
it
his
blue
green
eyes
going
quickly
over
her
slight
form
her
small
face
and
resting
for
a
second
curiously
upon
her
masses
of
coiled
golden
hair
i
why
no
you
sure
sure
she
went
on
her
way
again
and
he
stood
there
watching
her
go
then
he
turned
abruptly
and
walked
slowly
back
to
the
store
it
was
not
so
long
after
that
when
he
met
her
for
the
second
time
she
was
on
her
knees
in
the
yard
in
front
of
her
father
house
mending
the
fishing
nets
with
quick
deft
fingers
he
stopped
at
the
gate
feeling
the
intensity
of
his
blue
green
eyes
upon
her
she
looked
up
and
saw
him
she
got
to
her
feet
it
a
nice
morning
she
spoke
to
him
first
yes
he
said
you
live
up
there
she
pointed
a
bare
browned
arm
up
toward
the
sun
bleached
chalk
cliffs
by
yourself
yes

a
boat

he
opened
the
gate
and
went
into
the
yard
and
then
he
stood
there
just
looking
down
at
her
i
would
touch
no
net
her
brows
drew
together
in
a
puzzled
frown
you
mean

do
like
fishing
somehow
he
did
not
want
her
to
know
i
ai
the
one
to
take

from
the
sea

said
not

thanks
little
girl
mister
at
the
end
of
the
street
he
turned
to
look
back
she
was
on
her
knees
working
at
her
mending
of
the
nets
again
she
looked
very
small
kneeling
there
on
the
hard
brown
earth
with
the
straggling
lines
of
squat
weather
darkened
shanties
trailing
behind
her
out
onto
the
edge
of
the
yellow
sanded
beach
and
the
clear
unbroken
blue
of
the
autumn
skies
above
she
glanced
up
and
then
she
waved
her
hand
at
him
he
went
slowly
along
the
narrow
pathway
that
wound
through
the
sharp
crevices
of
the
chalk
cliffs
to
the
back
of
his
own
stone
built
shanty
that
night
he
stood
staring
out
at
the
sea
the
moon
was
on
the
wane
it
hung
very
low
in
the
sky
so
that
the
streak
of
it
seemed
to
dip
into
the
water
a
cold
northeast
wind
lashed
over
the
waves
dark
swollen
purplish
clouds
raced
together
in
an
angry
mass
the
sea
itself
was
black
but
for
the
tossing
gigantic
waves
with
their
dead
white
crests
of
spraying
foam
the
pounding
of
them
on
the
beach
below
him
vibrated
in
his
ears
the
were
flying
heavily
close
to
the
earth
their
inhuman
piercing
shrieking
filling
the
air
the
little
girl
had
spoken
to
him
he
turned
from
the
sea
then
he
went
into
his
shanty
he
bolted
the
great
iron
bolts
of
the
door
and
braced
himself
against
it
as
if
he
were
shutting
something
out
something
that
he
feared
something
that
was
certain
to
come
after
him
he
crouched
there
shivering
and
shuddering
the
pounding
of
the
sea
was
in
his
ears
the
wind
that
came
from
the
ocean
whistled
and
wailed
shrilly
around
and
around
the
house
he
leaned
there
his
back
to
the
door
his
hands
pressing
stiff
fingered
against
it
his
lips
moving
mumbling
dumbly
his
eyes
the
color
of
the
sea
stared
blindly
before
him
the
rumbling
roar
of
the
rising
tide
the
thundering
boom
of
it
and
in
the
sudden
lull
of
the
wind
the
hiss
of
the
seething
spray
the
sea
was
angry
he
thought
with
a
kind
of
paralyzing
terror
that
it
was
angry
with
him
it
was
calling
to
him
the
lashing
of
the
big
waves
demanded
him
the
sonorous
drumming
of
it
he
had
never
before
denied
its
call
the
persistent
thudding
of
it
there
at
the
base
of
the
chalk
cliffs
it
was
insisting
that
he
belonged
to
it
the
inhuman
piercing
shrieks
of
the
circling
mocked
him
they
knew
that
he
belonged
to
the
sea
how
could
he
even
think
of
that
golden
haired
little
girl
who
had
spoken
to
him
the
sea
was
angry
he
tore
at
the
iron
bolts
and
flinging
the
door
wide
open
he
rushed
out
to
the
edge
of
the
chalk
cliffs
and
as
he
stood
there
the
clouds
dwindled
in
a
vaporous
haze
away
from
the
skies
the
thin
line
of
the
waning
moon
grew
brighter
the
sea
lay
foam
flecked
and
calm
beneath
the
dark
heavens
and
at
the
base
of
the
chalk
cliffs
the
water
lapped
and
lapped
with
a
strange
insidious
sound
and
the
next
day
he
sat
there
in
front
of
his
shanty
his
reeds
in
his
hands
his
fingers
busy
with
his
basket
weaving
making
big
baskets
and
small
baskets
and
his
eyes
blue
green
and
strained
were
fixed
on
the
tranquil
blue
green
of
the
water
below
him
for
two
days
he
sat
there
in
front
of
his
iron
bolted
door
that
now
swung
wide
open
on
its
rusty
hinges
the
third
day
he
stood
upon
the
edge
of
the
precipice
it
was
a
gray
fog
drenched
day
the
mist
dripped
all
about
him
the
opaque
veil
of
it
shut
out
everything
in
wet
obliteration
he
stood
quite
still
knowing
that
beneath
its
dank
dribbling
thickness
the
sea
churned
wildly
in
its
rising
tide
and
standing
there
motionless
he
heard
a
voice
calling
through
the
quiet
denseness
of
the
fog
a
voice
coming
from
a
distance
and
muffled
by
the
mist
he
started
it
was
her
voice
calling
to
him
from
the
narrow
pathway
that
wound
up
the
chalk
cliffs
to
the
back
of
his
shanty
mister
oh
mister
he
reached
his
hand
out
in
front
of
him
trying
to
break
the
saturating
cover
of
the
fog
he
went
stumbling
unseeingly
toward
the
rear
of
the
house
mister
oh
mister
the
rear
of
the
shanty
his
feet
sank
down
into
the
turned
soil
of
the
truck
garden
he
stood
still
here
mister
the
voice
of
her
was
nearer
where
are
you
he
could
not
see
in
front
of
him
he
felt
that
she
was
close
here
little
girl
he
saw
the
faint
outline
of
her
shadow
then
through
the
obliterating
denseness
of
the
mist
some
fog
ai
it
mister
stay
where
you
are
there
the
precipice
i
ai
afraid
of
no
precipice
stay
where
you
are
he
could
hear
the
dripping
of
the
mist
over
the
window
ledges
and
then
he
thought
he
heard
smothered
by
the
weight
of
the
fog
the
pounding
of
the
sea
you
surprised
to
see
me
but
you
ai
able
to
see
me
are
you
no
you
ai
surprised
down
there
at
the
base
of
the
chalk
cliffs
the
sea
was
still
waiting
you
should
have
come
why
you
do
mean
you
ai
trying
to
tell
me
you
do
want
me
here
great
beads
of
moisture
trickled
down
across
his
eyes
little
girl
i
just
said
you
should
have
come
not
up
here
in
this
kind
of
weather
oh
the
weather
she
laughed
i
ai
the
one
to
mind
the
weather
mister
again
he
reached
his
hand
out
in
front
of
him
in
an
effort
to
rend
the
suffocating
thickness
of
the
fog
his
fingers
touched
her
arm
and
closed
over
it
from
below
him
came
the
repeated
warning
roar
of
the
waves
can
you
find
your
way
home
by
yourself
little
girl
i
ai
going
home
mister
not
yet
i
came
up
here
to
get
that
basket
you
said
you
had
for
me
you
know
the
medium
sized
one
i
give
it
to
you
now
her
hand
caught
at
his
hand
that
lay
on
her
arm
her
fingers
fastened
themselves
around
his
and
held
tightly
he
had
never
felt
anything
like
that
the
touch
of
them
was
cool
and
fresh
like
sea
weed
that
had
just
drifted
in
from
the
sea
and
then
from
far
off
across
the
water
came
the
shrill
piercing
shriek
of
a
gull
he
felt
her
start
that
only
a
little
girl
i
know
mister
but
do
it
sound
strange
almost
as
if
it
were
the
sea
itself
calling
for
something
for
a
second
he
could
not
speak
why
his
voice
was
hoarse
why
say
that
i
do
know
sometimes
i
get
to
feeling
mighty
queer
about
that
water
out
there
you
mean
why
you
ai
afraid
of
it
little
girl
are
you
afraid
there
ai
nothing
that
i
afraid
of
mister
why
i
go
anywhere
and
not
be
afraid
he
repeated
her
words
very
slowly
to
himself
you
go
anywhere
and
not
be
afraid
he
thought
then
that
the
fog
was
lifting
a
sickly
yellowish
glow
filtered
through
the
heavy
grayness
he
could
see
her
more
distinctly
there
only
one
thing
about
the
sea
mister
that
scare
me
and
that
she
broke
off
abruptly
what
little
girl
why
mister
why
i
ca
hardly
say
it
but
there
pa
and
there
my
brother
will
if
anything
ever
happened
if
the
sea
ever
did
anything
to
pa
or
will
why
i
guess
mister
i
just
die
do
he
said
quickly
do
you
talk
like
that
for
a
second
they
were
silent
the
sun
was
breaking
through
the
dwindling
thickness
of
the
mist
he
could
see
it
lifting
in
a
faint
gray
line
uncovering
the
reach
of
the
flat
salt
marshes
with
their
dank
yellowed
grasses
a
thin
silver
net
of
it
hung
for
a
second
between
the
sky
and
the
earth
and
was
gone
from
the
base
of
the
chalk
cliffs
came
the
sound
of
the
sea
lapping
and
lapping
with
insistent
cunning
she
dropped
his
hand
and
she
stood
there
looking
up
to
him
scanning
his
white
face
with
those
childlike
eyes
of
hers
you
live
up
here
because
of
the
sea
mister
yes
you
ever
feel
the
sea
something
alive
like
you
and
me
you
feel
that
too
yes
she
said
slowly
and
i
knew
you
felt
it
because
the
first
time
i
saw
you
why
you
somehow
something
like
the
sea
his
hands
clinched
at
his
sides
his
breath
came
in
quick
rasping
gasps
i
get
your
basket
he
muttered
he
rushed
into
his
one
room
shanty
and
caught
up
the
basket
nearest
to
him
and
went
out
again
to
her
she
took
the
basket
from
him
in
silence
she
slipped
the
handle
of
it
on
to
her
arm
her
hands
rubbed
against
each
other
the
fingers
of
them
twining
and
intertwining
i
be
going
now
mister
yes
i
got
to
be
getting
home
before
pa
and
will
go
out
to
the
nets
little
girl
mister
and
thanks
he
stood
there
and
watched
her
go
from
the
back
of
his
stone
built
shanty
down
the
narrow
winding
path
that
lay
along
the
sun
bleached
chalk
cliffs
she
went
quickly
and
lightly
down
the
steep
incline
her
small
slender
figure
in
its
blue
print
dress
with
the
sun
bringing
out
the
burnished
glints
in
her
golden
hair
his
eyes
strained
after
her
in
a
short
while
he
lost
her
from
sight
he
went
back
to
his
basket
making
then
and
as
he
sat
there
his
fingers
weaving
and
bending
the
supple
reeds
mechanically
working
them
into
shape
he
tried
to
shut
out
all
thought
of
her
to
feel
as
though
she
had
never
come
to
him
to
rivet
his
attention
upon
the
insistent
pounding
of
the
sea
that
hurled
itself
again
and
again
at
the
base
of
the
chalk
cliffs
calling
and
calling
to
him
after
a
while
the
early
deep
blue
dusk
of
the
twilight
came
he
got
stiffly
to
his
feet
the
long
moving
shadows
were
quivering
in
fantastic
purpled
patterns
on
the
ground
about
him
great
daubs
of
them
clung
in
the
crevices
of
the
chalk
cliffs
a
mat
of
shadows
crept
over
the
flat
salt
marshes
and
through
the
dank
yellowed
grasses
there
was
a
sudden
chill
in
the
wind
that
came
to
him
from
off
the
water
a
flock
of
screeching
wildly
beating
their
wings
rose
from
the
cliffs
and
whirred
out
toward
the
open
sea
the
uncanny
piercing
sound
of
their
shrieking
coming
deafeningly
back
to
him
he
stood
there
staring
at
the
ocean
his
head
well
back
his
nostrils
dilated
his
blue
green
eyes
strangely
wide
far
in
the
distance
against
the
graying
horizon
he
could
see
the
choppy
white
capped
waves
racing
over
the
smooth
dark
water
even
as
he
looked
the
sea
began
to
rise
in
great
swollen
billows
the
wind
too
was
rising
he
could
hear
the
distant
cry
of
it
his
heart
began
to
thump
wildly
he
knew
what
was
going
to
happen
just
as
he
always
knew
he
could
feel
what
the
sea
was
going
to
do
he
stood
there
undecided
a
quick
picture
came
to
him
of
the
storm
he
had
seen
it
all
before
he
had
stood
there
on
the
chalk
cliffs
and
watched
it
all
watched
the
shattered
broken
logs
the
swirling
sucking
water
the
sea
had
held
him
under
its
spell
had
compelled
him
to
witness
its
maddened
infuriated
stalking
of
its
prey
her
people
were
out
there
her
pa
and
her
will
why
had
she
told
him
that
why
had
she
said
if
anything
ever
happened
to
them
she
would
die
why
he
could
just
make
out
the
stiff
sticks
of
the
nets
reaching
thin
and
dark
from
the
surface
of
the
gray
water
against
the
lighter
gray
skies
and
the
boats
rowing
toward
them
the
boats
with
the
fishermen
he
could
see
the
slender
patches
of
them
rising
and
falling
with
the
waves
going
slowly
to
the
nets
he
could
distinguish
the
small
dark
shadows
of
the
men
rowing
they
had
pulled
him
out
of
the
sea
in
that
early
morning
he
who
was
something
come
from
the
sea
and
of
the
sea
and
always
belonging
to
the
sea
to
betray
the
sea
the
waves
were
racing
in
to
the
shore
the
thumping
deafening
boom
of
them
there
at
the
base
of
the
chalk
cliffs
below
him
he
tried
to
tear
his
eyes
away
from
it
it
held
him
as
it
ever
held
him
it
kept
him
there
as
though
he
belonged
to
it
as
though
it
knew
he
belonged
to
it
and
knew
that
he
knew
it
a
strange
uneasiness
arose
within
him
even
before
he
was
conscious
of
it
he
felt
that
the
sea
had
sensed
it
its
insistent
angry
pounding
threatened
him
she
had
said
that
she
would
die
below
him
the
swirling
churning
sea
he
turned
then
and
went
very
slowly
down
the
narrow
winding
path
that
led
along
the
sun
bleached
chalk
cliffs
through
the
deep
blue
dusk
of
the
evening
he
went
and
the
gray
blotched
reach
of
the
flat
salt
marshes
with
their
dank
yellowed
grasses
lay
all
about
him
and
overhead
the
cloud
spotted
moving
gray
of
the
sky
and
beneath
him
the
raging
sea
that
called
to
him
and
called
he
never
stopped
until
he
came
to
the
weather
darkened
shanty
where
she
lived
he
paused
then
at
the
gate
a
lighted
lamp
was
in
one
of
the
windows
on
the
ground
floor
the
soft
glow
of
it
streamed
in
a
long
ladder
of
light
out
to
him
in
the
darkness
he
opened
the
gate
and
went
haltingly
across
the
yard
and
after
a
moment
hesitation
he
knocked
at
the
door
at
the
far
end
of
the
street
the
sea
thudded
over
the
yellow
sanded
beach
the
pale
stretch
of
it
coming
out
of
the
grayness
in
a
long
white
line
she
answered
his
knock
the
light
from
the
lamp
swept
through
the
open
doorway
something
in
his
face
terrified
her
something
that
she
had
never
before
seen
in
those
blue
green
eyes
the
color
of
the
sea
what
is
it
what
happened
he
stood
there
just
looking
down
at
her
oh
mister
tell
me
please
what
is
it
her
two
hands
went
up
to
her
throat
and
caught
tightly
at
her
neck
there
a
storm
she
looked
out
into
the
quiet
darkening
evening
a
storm
there
a
bad
storm
coming
he
could
hardly
say
the
words
she
stared
up
at
him
her
childlike
eyes
were
very
wide
will
it
be
soon
he
never
took
his
blue
green
eyes
from
off
her
face
it
coming
quick
they
out
pa
and
will
he
said
it
very
quietly
then
that
why
i
here
how
can
we
get
them
back
oh
little
girl
he
muttered
little
girl
how
mister

a
boat
there
sam
wilkins
smack
down
there
at
the
wharf
we
could
take
that
then
i
go
after
them
they
went
from
the
door
together
down
the
street
and
out
onto
the
back
patch
of
the
wharf
through
the
grayness
they
could
see
the
boat
rocking
on
the
water
at
the
farther
end
the
wail
of
the
rising
wind
the
pounding
of
the
sea
and
close
to
them
the
muffled
bumping
sound
of
the
smack
thrown
again
and
again
at
the
long
wooden
piles
of
the
wharf
for
a
second
they
stood
quite
still
i
going
he
said
her
arms
went
suddenly
up
around
his
neck
her
lips
brushed
across
his
he
felt
her
body
shivering
he
caught
and
held
her
to
him
and
then
he
let
her
go
and
went
quickly
to
the
end
of
the
wharf
and
pulled
the
boat
alongside
and
stepped
into
it
he
looked
up
at
her
standing
there
against
the
gray
sky
he
could
see
the
white
patches
of
her
face
and
her
hands
and
the
pale
mass
of
her
hair
that
the
wind
had
loosened
and
down
through
the
draggling
grayness
he
distinctly
saw
her
childlike
eyes
searching
for
his
before
he
could
stop
her
she
was
in
the
boat

you
ca
the
rain
began
then
great
drops
of
it
fell
into
his
face
the
whining
of
the
wind
was
terrific
you
do
know
what
it
means
i
do
know
oh
god
i
do
he
caught
up
his
oars
then
he
rowed
with
all
his
strength
the
whole
thing
was
so
strange
to
him
her
going
their
being
out
on
the
water
the
rowing
the
waves
rose
in
tremendous
black
swells
all
about
them
the
rain
and
the
spray
drenched
them
the
wind
rocked
the
small
boat
the
whistling
wail
of
it
the
lowering
cloud
sprawled
pitchy
sky
he
pulled
in
silence
until
they
came
to
the
nets
she
stood
up
in
the
boat
and
called
again
and
again
her
voice
rose
into
the
wind
sit
down
he
told
her
a
distant
shout
answered
her
he
bent
to
his
oars
then
till
he
came
to
the
cluster
of
smacks
on
the
other
side
of
the
nets
pa
she
cried
sally
what

back
sally
it
blow
over
she
turned
to
him
then
you
tell
him
she
said
it
desperately
you
tell
him
he
waited
until
he
got
just
alongside
of
the
fishing
smack
it
going
to
be
a
bad
one
he
said
it
slowly
he
thought
then
that
the
angry
swirling
of
the
sea
became
more
infuriated
that
the
swell
of
the
waves
was
greater
far
in
the
distance
he
heard
the
inhuman
piercing
shriek
of
the
who
that
there
sally
it
me
he
saw
that
both
of
the
men
in
the
smack
leaned
toward
him
what
it
it
me

go
on
back
pa
will
make
him
go
on
back
get
the
others
to
go

pa
please
for
answer
he
heard
the
man
shout
to
the
other
boats
about
the
nets
storm
lads
make
for
shore
he
saw
a
moment
hesitation
in
that
cluster
of
fishing
smacks
and
then
one
by
one
he
watched
them
pull
away
from
the
nets
and
row
toward
the
beach
he
reached
out
his
hand
and
caught
hold
of
the
other
boat
gunwale
make
the
little
girl
go
back
with
you
come
on
sally
hop
across
there
pa
help
you

follow

all
right
tell
the
little
girl
to
go
with
you
with
me
tell
her
you
go
on
we
come
right
after
you
he
felt
the
boat
at
his
side
give
a
quick
lurch
his
hand
slipped
into
the
water
he
could
feel
the
sea
pulling
at
it
his
own
smack
rocked
perilously
for
a
second
and
then
he
saw
the
girl
father
and
brother
rowing
toward
the
beach
what
what
you
do
that
for
she
did
not
answer
him
a
wave
broke
over
the
bow
of
his
boat
in
the
darkness
he
could
see
her
crawling
on
her
hands
and
knees
along
the
bottom
of
the
smack
to
him
he
reached
down
and
caught
her
up
in
his
arms
will
they
get
back
safe
she
whispered
it
yes
sure
they
there
now
and
then
the
storm
broke
the
lightning
flashed
in
zigzagging
blindly
flares
across
the
dark
of
the
sky
the
thunder
rumbled
in
clattering
crescendo
the
sea
tore
and
swirled
and
sucked
wave
after
wave
broke
over
the
small
boat
she
rocked
and
pitched
and
swivelled
the
oars
were
washed
away
the
rain
and
the
wind
stung
them
with
their
fury
the
spray
cut
into
their
faces
from
far
off
came
the
uncanny
inhuman
piercing
sound
of
the
shrieking
he
knew
then
that
the
time
had
come
he
held
her
very
close
to
him
he
had
filched
his
soul
from
the
sea
he
who
was
something
come
from
the
sea
and
of
the
sea
and
always
belonging
to
the
sea
he
had
betrayed
the
sea
little
girl
i
not
afraid
little
girl
i
could
stay
on
without
you
i
always
knew
always
that
some
time
you
go
back
you
not
scared
just
hold
me
tight
the
foam
covered
seething
breadth
of
the
water
churning
itself
into
white
spumed
frenzy
the
dark
lowering
skies
the
black
deep
pull
of
the
sea
tighter
flowers
the
night
wind
brought
him
the
smell
of
flowers
for
a
moment
he
fought
against
the
smothering
oppression
of
the
thing
he
hated
for
a
second
the
same
struggle
against
its
stifling
weight
his
eyes
closed
with
the
brows
above
them
drawn
and
tight
his
teeth
caught
savagely
at
his
lower
lip
gnawing
at
it
until
the
blood
came
his
hands
the
fingers
wide
spread
the
veins
purple
and
standing
out
moved
slowly
and
tensely
to
his
throat
how
he
dreaded
it
how
he
abominated
the
thing
how
he
loathed
the
subtle
insidious
fragrance
how
he
abhorred
flowers
flowers
with
a
tremendous
forcing
effort
he
opened
his
eyes
the
same
garden
the
same
sweeping
reach
of
flowers
flowers
as
far
as
he
could
see
gigantic
blossoming
clumps
of
rhododendron
slender
fragile
lilies
of
the
valley
showing
white
and
faint
on
the
deep
green
leaves
violets
somewhere
he
got
the
sickeningly
sweet
scent
of
them
early
roses
growing
riotously
he
detested
the
perfume
of
roses
overhead
the
darkening
sky
that
held
in
the
west
the
thin
gray
crescent
of
the
coming
moon
and
all
through
the
garden
the
first
dull
blue
shadows
of
evening
shadows
that
blurred
around
the
shapes
of
flowers
shadows
that
spread
over
the
flowers
smearing
out
the
spotting
color
of
them
until
they
were
a
ghostly
mass
shadows
that
brought
out
in
all
its
pungent
power
the
assailing
suffocating
smell
of
the
flowers
he
stood
there
waiting
he
could
feel
his
heartbeats
throbbing
in
his
temples
his
breath
came
in
long
racking
gasps
his
one
thought
was
to
breathe
regularly
one
two
he
tried
to
think
of
something
other
than
his
breathing
the
intangible
odor
of
the
flowers
choked
him
with
their
stealthy
cunning
it
was
always
like
this
at
first
he
had
always
to
contend
silently
and
with
all
his
strength
against
this
illusive
abominated
thing
poured
out
to
him
by
the
flowers
his
strangling
intaking
of
breath
one
two
never
in
all
his
life
had
he
been
without
his
horror
of
flowers
never
until
now
had
he
known
why
he
hated
them
lately
he
had
begun
to
wonder
if
they
hated
him
it
would
be
better
when
she
came
they
were
her
flowers
her
flowers
that
took
all
her
time
all
her
thoughts
all
her
caring
and
affection
her
flowers
that
grew
all
about
her
her
flowers
that
held
her
away
from
him
he
hated
her
flowers
one
two
it
would
be
quite
all
right
when
she
was
there
her
flowers
would
not
harm
her
and
then
he
heard
the
soft
uneven
rustling
of
her
skirts
he
looked
up
to
see
her
walking
toward
him
down
the
long
lane
of
her
flowers
through
the
drenching
grayness
he
could
see
that
she
wore
the
same
light
dress
that
made
her
tall
and
clung
to
her
in
folds
so
that
her
figure
seemed
to
bend
he
could
distinguish
the
heavy
shadowy
mass
of
her
uncovered
hair
her
eyes
set
far
apart
and
dark
fixed
themselves
on
him
a
quick
light
flooded
into
them
in
the
dusk
he
saw
that
her
hands
were
clasped
together
and
that
they
were
filled
with
lilies
throw
them
away
he
said
when
she
stood
beside
him
they
so
pretty
she
told
him
staring
down
at
the
lilies
let
me
keep
these
just
this
once
throw
them
away
he
repeated
i
ca
stand
the
sight
of
them
you
know
that
why
must
you
go
on
picking
the
things
and
picking
them
she
shrugged
her
shoulders
her
eyes
left
his
face
i
love
them
she
said
simply
love
he
laughed
how
can
you
love
flowers
oh
but
i
can
well
i
ca
he
had
been
wanting
her
to
know
that
for
a
long
while
why
not
she
asked
him
he
could
not
bring
himself
to
tell
her
why
not
throw
them
away
she
let
the
lilies
sift
through
her
fingers
one
by
one
and
then
the
last
fell
to
the
ground
are
you
satisfied
no
he
said
what
good
does
it
do
anyway
the
next
time
it
be
the
same
again
it
always
is
she
reached
out
a
hand
and
touched
his
arm
but
i
never
know
when
you
coming
if
i
knew
i
would
be
picking
flowers
i
ca
help
having
them
in
my
hands
when
you
come
if
i
know
can
i
it
is
that
he
covered
her
hand
lying
on
his
arm
with
his
hand
what
is
it
then
she
pulled
her
fingers
from
under
his
and
drew
away
a
bit
he
made
up
his
mind
to
try
and
tell
her
it
the
flowers
i
should
have
told
you
long
ago
even
at
the
beginning
when
we
first
when
i
first
came
here
i
she
interrupted
him
when
was
that
how
long
ago
how
can
i
tell
ages
ago
it
does
seem
she
said
it
slowly
it
does
seem
as
if
you
had
always
come
here
i
ca
remember
the
time
when
you
did
come
it
strange
is
it
because
you
know
there
was
a
time
when
you
were
here
that
was
when
i
began
with
the
flowers
i
wish
you
never
begun
he
muttered
that
what
i
got
to
say
to
you
i
hate
flowers
i
always
hated
them
i
never
quite
knew
why
till
i
came
here
and
found
you
loving
them
so
much
you
never
think
of
anything
or
talk
of
anything
but
your
flowers
if
you
must
know
why
i
hate
them
how
silly
of
you
he
thought
she
smiled
it
not
he
said
there
nothing
silly
about
it
i
like
to
have
you
think
of
other
things
there
plenty
of
other
things
i
want
you
to
think
of
them
i
want
he
broke
off
abruptly
what
do
you
want
i
i
want
you
i
ca
say
it
for
a
little
while
they
were
silent
it
grew
darker
the
shadows
that
lay
along
the
ground
moved
upward
through
the
bushes
of
rhododendron
he
watched
the
fantastic
mesh
of
them
shifting
there
the
gray
of
the
crescent
moon
grew
faintly
yellow
his
eyes
roved
over
the
shadow
splashed
reach
of
flowers
the
heavy
odor
of
them
sickened
him
if
only
you
try
to
like
them
she
said
it
wistfully
it
no
use
i
could
if
you
worked
among
them
the
way
i
work
perhaps
you
could
i
tell
you
i
could
but
they
so
lovely
her
hand
went
out
and
touched
a
rose
taken
me
years
to
perfect
this
one
you
ca
see
in
this
light
but
during
the
day
why
do
you
ever
come
here
during
the
day
i
do
know
he
told
her
quite
truthfully
during
the
day
she
went
on
you
ought
to
see
it
it
yellow
almost
gold
and
its
center
that
quite
quite
pink
with
the
very
middle
bit
almost
scarlet
i
love
this
rose
he
thought
then
that
he
could
smell
the
particular
fragrance
of
the
one
rose
permeating
subtly
through
the
odor
of
all
those
other
flowers
she
loved
that
yellow
and
gold
and
scarlet
rose
good
heavens
he
said
do
stop
telling
me
how
much
you
love
your
flowers
if
you
were
with
them
all
the
time
he
did
not
let
her
finish
that
all
you
do
is
it
just
care
for
your
flowers
all
day
long
why
yes
she
was
surprised
of
course
it
all
i
do
it
all
i
care
about
doing
it
takes
every
minute
of
my
time
you
know
that
you
yes
i
know
it
his
tone
was
gruff
then
why
do
you
always
talk
about
it
like
this
she
asked
him
done
it
for
years
ever
since
i
can
remember
it
hard
work
but
i
like
doing
it
i
do
think
you
know
how
alone
i
always
been
i
afraid
you
do
realize
that
not
really
anyway
i
just
never
had
anything
to
care
about
until
i
started
in
with
the
flowers
i
do
know
if
i
ought
to
tell
you
she
stopped
speaking
quite
suddenly
what
i
do
think
you
like
to
know
what
i
was
going
to
say
tell
me
he
insisted
well
she
spoke
slowly
sometimes
i
feel
as
though
it
so
hard
to
say
but
sometimes
i
feel
as
if
the
flowers
know
how
much
i
care
and
and
as
if
they
care
too
why
say
that
i
do
quite
know
only
they
living
things
they
are
are
they
i
suppose
they
are
but
that
no
reason
for
you
to
encourage
yourself
in
all
those
queer
ideas
about
them
queer
ideas
you
know
the
sort
of
thing
i
mean
i
do
what
sort
he
thought
then
that
her
voice
had
a
hurt
sound
drifting
through
it
loving
them
for
one
thing
but
what
can
i
do
what
else
have
i
to
love
i
just
told
you
how
much
alone
i
am
all
the
time
really
the
flowers
are
the
only
things
i
have
i
just
told
you
that
he
waited
a
second
you
have
me
he
said
you
but
you
hardly
ever
come
i
so
lonesome
you
ca
know
what
that
means
i
am
lonely
and
you
why
sometimes
i
think
you
not
real
not
even
real
do
for
god
sake
do
say
that
i
ca
help
it
i
tell
you
i
ca
it
all
right
now
it
always
all
right
when
you
here
but
after
you
go
nothing
is
real
to
me
nothing
but
the
flowers
and
you
do
want
me
to
care
for
them
you
keep
saying
you
hate
them
they
all
i
got
wo
you
ca
you
see
that
but
if
i
come
here
to
stay
to
stay
would
you
want
me
here
he
saw
her
hands
move
upward
until
they
lay
in
two
white
spots
on
her
breast
want
you
if
only
you
knew
he
waited
a
moment
before
he
said
it
and
you
could
love
me
i
always
loved
you
she
spoke
in
a
whisper
i
find
a
way
he
told
her
there
must
be
a
way
but
how
how
i
do
know
i
never
thought
about
it
before
i
never
knew
you
cared
i
thought
it
was
just
the
flowers
nothing
but
the
flowers
i
hate
the
flowers
the
feel
of
them
the
sight
of
them
the
smell
of
them
i
could
ever
come
here
without
being
suffocated
i
was
jealous
of
them
fearfully
jealous
and
i
thought
her
voice
was
low
i
thought
that
because
i
feel
they
love
me
because
i
love
them
somehow
they
brought
you
here
and
when
i
come
when
her
voice
itself
trailed
to
a
whisper
i
will
come
to
you
i
will
how
can
you
find
me
somehow
i
will
if
only
you
could
i
am
lonely
terribly
lonely
if
it
would
be
soon
it
must
be
soon
i
wait
for
you
always
but
if
you
are
real
you
come
soon
it
lonely
waiting
and
i
do
even
know
if
you
are
i
do
even
know
the
reverend
william
cruthers
started
from
his
chair
some
one
had
banged
the
window
closed
some
one
had
lit
the
lamp
on
the
center
table
its
yellow
light
trickled
through
the
room
and
over
the
scant
old
fashioned
furniture
and
crept
upwards
across
the
booklined
walls
the
room
was
stuffy
and
close
the
smell
of
flowers
had
gone
billy
he
turned
to
see
his
sister
rushing
across
the
room
to
him
he
stooped
a
bit
and
caught
her
in
his
arms
why
gina
i
did
know
why
did
you
write
and
tell
me
who
brought
you
up
from
the
station
the
girl
kissed
him
hastily
and
enthusiastically
on
either
cheek
a
nice
welcome
home
she
laughed
breathlessly
i
was
just
about
to
make
a
graceful
and
silent
exit
but
gina
i
did
know
of
course
you
did
know
you
could
i
would
write
i
wanted
to
surprise
you
are
you
surprised
billy
awfully
he
conceded
awfully
her
brows
puckered
very
much
so
i
mean
you
never
do
know
just
what
you
do
mean
do
you
william
naturally
i
do
it
would
be
natural
for
you
if
you
did
the
girl
slid
away
from
him
and
went
and
perched
herself
comfortably
on
the
arm
of
the
chair
in
which
he
had
been
sitting
her
hands
were
busy
with
her
hatpins
and
her
eyes
that
peered
up
at
him
were
filled
with
laughter
how
did
you
get
up
from
the
station
gina
oh
such
a
lovely
way
billy
and
so
very
energetic
for
me
i
walked
now
what
do
you
know
about
that
he
frowned
a
bit
very
good
for
you
i
do
doubt
he
said
it
stiffly
after
all
the
motoring
you
must
have
done
with
those
friends
of
yours
she
had
gotten
her
hat
off
she
sat
dangling
it
by
the
brim
the
lamplight
streaked
over
her
hair
now
do
be
nasty
william
and
whatever
you
do
do
speak
to
me
as
if
i
were
a
congregation
the
trents
are
perfectly
lovely
people
even
if
they
are
terribly
rich
and
not
very
christian
and
and
georgie
trent
is
a
sweet
boy
and
she
added
it
hastily
wood
mills
is
a
duck
of
a
place
he
thrust
his
hands
into
his
coat
pockets
i
never
said
it
was
gina
she
paid
no
attention
to
him
her
legs
were
crossed
her
one
foot
was
swinging
to
and
fro
her
eyes
were
fixed
speculatively
on
the
foot
and
you
ought
to
be
very
glad
to
have
me
here
again
suppose
listened
to
georgie
and
married
him
right
off
instead
of
coming
back
here
a
nice
fix
you
have
been
in
you
know
perfectly
well
no
one
in
all
the
world
does
for
you
as
nicely
as
i
do
you
know
that
do
you
he
smiled
down
at
her
to
be
sure
i
do
as
a
matter
of
fact
she
went
on
when
i
came
in
here
you
were
half
if
not
altogether
asleep
in
this
chair
i
was
asleep
gina
oh
that
what
you
always
say
but
i
banged
in
and
you
did
hear
me
i
lighted
the
lamp
and
you
did
seem
particularly
conscious
of
it
and
the
window
the
window
was
wide
open
i
closed
that
for
you
the
wind
was
bringing
in
just
yards
of
those
flower
smells
you
hate
so
was
it
gina
huh
huh
you
smelled
them
then
his
tone
was
strangely
quiet
of
course
i
did
come
and
sit
here
billy
she
wiggled
herself
into
a
more
comfortable
position
on
the
arm
of
the
chair
and
tell
your
onliest
sister
how
much
you
love
her
he
went
and
sat
beside
her
in
the
chair
he
put
his
arm
about
her
waist
you
a
dear
child
gina
i
know
it
she
snuggled
close
to
him
and
i
had
the
most
divine
time
billy
wood
mills
is
a
glorious
place
there
was
an
awful
lot
to
do
but
whatever
we
did
was
great
fun
you
have
a
good
time
anywhere
little
sister
would
i
her
eyes
wavered
about
the
room
a
bit
hungrily
something
in
her
voice
pulled
his
eyes
up
to
her
face
gina
what
is
it
nothing
billy
she
felt
his
fingers
tighten
at
her
side
are
you
happy
here
gina
of
course
i
am
billy
her
head
was
thrown
back
so
that
the
long
line
of
her
throat
showed
in
its
firm
molded
whiteness
only
billy
i
want
i
do
think
i
even
know
what
i
want
only
just
sometimes
i
feel
it
a
want
that
perhaps
is
even
mine
it
for
something
well
for
something
that
does
feel
here
he
stroked
her
hand
it
lonesome
for
you
gina
no
it
is
that
it
just
oh
i
guess
it
just
that
i
worry
about
you
me
gina
yes
billy
sometimes
you
look
so
so
starved
that
what
makes
me
think
it
your
want
i
feel
yours
that
you
want
very
much
and
and
billy
that
you
ca
get
hold
of
no
gina
no
she
pressed
her
cheek
against
his
oh
billy
she
spoke
quickly
there
was
one
place
out
there
at
wood
mills
you
would
have
liked
it
but
it
was
too
wonderful
he
drew
a
deep
breath
of
relief
at
the
sudden
change
in
her
voice
what
was
it
gina
why
would
i
have
liked
it
she
fidgeted
a
bit
why
oh
because
because
what
gina
it
was
just
one
big
estate
billy
a
girl
owns
it
she
an
orphan
she
very
beautiful
she
lives
there
all
by
herself
except
for
a
couple
of
old
servants
claire
trent
and
i
saw
her
once
or
twice
when
we
rode
through
the
place
claire
says
she
sort
of
queer
she
does
bother
about
people
she
does
like
them
claire
says
she
spends
all
her
time
around
the
place
that
sounds
very
strenuous
gina
oh
it
is
billy
it
lovely
the
estate
is
i
heard
the
places
there
are
pretty
pretty
but
this
one
billy
in
her
enthusiasm
she
leaned
eagerly
forward
you
could
imagine
it
there
are
miles
and
miles
and
the
whole
thing
claire
says
the
whole
year
round
it
just
one
big
mass
of
flowers
in
spite
of
himself
he
pulled
his
arm
away
from
the
girl
waist
oh
is
it
billy
i
know
you
do
like
flowers
but
this
you
never
seen
anything
like
this
there
probably
lots
and
lots
of
places
like
it
little
sister
oh
no
her
tone
was
vehement
there
could
be
not
such
a
garden
all
rhododendrons
and
lilies
of
the
valley
is
anything
wrong
billy
nothing
those
flowers
grow
in
all
gardens
at
this
time
of
the
year
she
stared
into
his
blanched
face
and
her
brows
drew
together
in
a
puzzled
frown
not
like
this
billy
really
i
never
seen
such
rhododendrons
or
such
lilies
and
the
violets
and
roses
he
got
to
his
feet
suddenly
what
he
asked
hoarsely
what
flowers
did
you
say
why
rhododendrons
and
lilies
and
lilies
what
is
it
billy
go
on
gina
go
on
billy
lilies
of
the
valley
and
violets
gina
and
roses
she
finished
mechanically
what
kind
of
roses
gina
the
puzzled
frown
left
her
face
glorious
roses
billy
she
was
enthusiastic
again
there
never
been
roses
like
these
why
there
one
kind
of
a
rose
it
known
all
over
now
it
took
her
years
and
years
to
grow
it
what
sort
of
a
rose
gina
what
sort
did
you
say
i
did
say
billy
i
do
even
know
the
name
of
it
but
it
a
yellow
rose
almost
gold
and
its
center
is
pink
and
and
scarlet
for
a
moment
they
were
silent
did
you
see
this
this
woman
gina
often
oh
once
or
twice
billy
when
gina
in
the
evenings
each
time
where
was
she
gina
why
how
strange
you
are
billy
where
gina
tell
me
hear
tell
me
where
in
her
garden
billy
what
there
to
get
so
excited
about
he
fought
for
his
control
then
i
like
to
know
gina
where
you
saw
her
and
and
the
girl
interrupted
him
i
saw
her
in
the
evenings
in
her
garden
she
used
to
walk
down
well
it
looked
like
a
long
lane
of
flowers
to
be
exact
billy
it
was
always
in
the
evening
and
kind
of
gray
so
i
could
see
very
much
except
that
she
wore
a
light
clingy
sort
of
dress
she
stopped
for
a
second
yes
gina
his
voice
was
more
quiet
now
i
told
you
she
was
a
bit
queer
did
i
queer
god
she
was
lonesome
gina
yes
the
girl
caught
at
his
last
words
i
bet
she
was
lonesome
any
one
would
be
living
like
that
that
what
makes
her
queer
i
guess
i
saw
her
both
times
with
my
own
eyes
come
down
the
garden
with
her
hands
full
of
flowers
both
times
i
saw
her
stand
quite
still
and
then
claire
and
i
would
see
her
drop
her
flowers
to
the
ground
that
was
the
funny
part
she
did
throw
them
away
it
was
that
you
know
no
gina
she
well
she
drop
them
one
by
one
as
if
as
if
what
gina
oh
as
if
she
were
being
made
to
do
it
he
went
to
his
knees
then
he
buried
his
head
in
the
girl
lap
she
leaned
anxiously
forward
her
hand
smoothing
his
hair
billy
billy
dear
are
you
well
billy
tell
me
he
could
not
bring
himself
to
speak
billy
is
this
what
you
do
when
i
come
home
to
you
shame
on
you
billy
why
why
billy
are
you
glad
to
have
me
here
say
you
thank
god
he
whispered
thank
god
he
got
to
his
feet
then
the
girl
rose
from
her
chair
and
clung
to
him
i
never
seen
you
like
this
billy
listen
gina
his
voice
was
low
when
you
go
upstairs
to
take
off
your
things
pack
my
grip
little
sister
i
going
away
away
billy
yes
gina
but
where
billy
to
a
place
where
i
wanted
to
go
for
a
very
long
long
time
little
sister
but
billy
will
you
do
that
for
me
now
gina
i
i
want
to
leave
when
billy
as
soon
as
i
can
gina
it
must
be
soon
the
girl
went
out
of
the
room
very
quietly
he
crossed
over
to
the
window
and
threw
it
open
darkness
as
far
as
he
could
see
darkness
in
which
were
smudged
lighter
things
without
shape
somewhere
in
the
distance
the
feathery
ends
of
branches
brushed
their
leaves
to
and
fro
against
the
sky
he
knew
that
the
wind
was
stirring
he
looked
up
at
the
heavens
gray
and
dark
save
where
the
thin
crescent
moon
held
its
haunting
yellow
light
that
was
slurred
over
by
drifting
clouds
and
then
held
again
he
could
see
the
wind
driving
the
clouds
the
swish
of
the
wind
out
there
going
through
those
smudged
lighter
things
without
shape
he
leaned
far
over
the
sill
and
suddenly
the
night
wind
brought
him
the
smell
of
flowers
gradually
the
odor
of
the
flowers
blending
subtly
and
faint
at
first
grew
more
distinct
heavier
he
stood
there
smiling
flowers
her
flowers
i
coming
he
whispered
i
coming
to
you
now
dear
the
shadow
he
was
colossally
vain
he
lived
with
his
wife
ellen
in
the
small
house
on
peach
tree
road
there
was
nothing
pretentious
about
the
house
there
were
any
number
of
similar
houses
along
the
line
of
peach
tree
road
for
that
matter
the
house
was
the
kind
planted
innumerable
times
in
the
numerous
suburbs
of
the
large
city
still
it
was
his
house
his
own
that
meant
a
lot
to
him
whenever
he
thought
of
it
and
he
thought
of
it
often
enough
he
liked
to
feel
the
thing
actually
belonged
to
him
it
emphasized
his
being
to
himself
the
house
was
a
affair
built
of
wood
and
white
washed
a
green
mansard
roof
came
down
over
the
small
green
shuttered
upper
windows
on
the
lower
floor
the
windows
were
somewhat
larger
with
the
same
solid
wooden
green
shutters
a
gravel
path
led
up
to
the
front
door
two
drooping
willow
trees
stood
on
either
side
of
the
wicker
gate
before
the
time
when
his
aunt
had
died
and
had
left
him
the
house
he
had
not
been
particularly
successful
at
the
age
of
he
had
found
himself
a
journalist
and
nothing
more
he
had
had
no
ambition
to
ever
be
anything
else
he
was
at
all
times
so
utterly
confident
that
the
work
he
was
doing
was
quite
right
chiefly
because
it
was
the
work
that
he
was
doing
no
man
had
a
more
unbounded
faith
in
himself
at
that
time
he
had
not
been
conscious
of
his
lack
of
success
now
of
course
he
looked
back
on
it
all
as
a
period
of
development
something
which
had
prepared
him
for
this
that
was
even
then
destined
to
come
he
told
himself
that
in
this
small
house
away
from
the
surrounding
clatter
and
nuisances
of
the
city
he
had
found
time
to
write
to
be
himself
to
really
express
what
he
knew
himself
to
be
he
had
become
tremendously
well
known
in
that
space
of
six
years
no
one
ever
doubted
the
genius
of
jasper
wald
he
wrote
as
a
man
writes
who
is
actually
inspired
his
books
were
read
with
interest
and
surprisingly
favorable
comment
there
was
something
different
something
singularly
appealing
in
all
of
jasper
wald
works
at
that
time
his
conceit
was
inordinate
it
extended
to
a
sort
of
personal
physical
vanity
in
itself
that
was
grotesque
there
was
absolutely
nothing
attractive
in
the
loosely
jointed
body
of
him
or
for
that
matter
in
the
narrow
head
covered
with
sparse
blond
gray
hair
the
eyes
of
him
were
of
rather
a
washed
blue
and
bulged
a
bit
from
out
their
sockets
the
nose
was
a
singularly
squat
affair
at
the
same
time
too
long
the
mouth
was
unpleasantly
small
with
lips
so
colorless
and
thin
that
the
line
of
it
was
like
some
weird
mark
yet
he
was
vain
of
his
appearance
but
then
his
egoism
was
the
keynote
of
his
entire
being
some
people
could
not
forgive
it
in
him
even
when
they
acknowledged
him
as
a
writer
and
praised
his
work
the
man
in
literature
was
spoken
of
as
a
mystic
a
poet
a
possessor
of
subtlety
that
was
close
to
genius
in
actual
life
jasper
wald
was
an
out
and
out
materialist
as
for
his
wife
ellen
she
was
rather
a
tall
woman
thin
but
not
ungraceful
her
features
were
good
very
regular
still
somewhat
nondescript
all
but
her
eyes
her
eyes
were
strange
green
in
color
and
so
heavily
lidded
that
one
could
rarely
see
the
expression
of
them
then
too
she
had
an
odd
manner
of
moving
there
never
seemed
to
be
any
effort
or
any
abruptness
in
whatever
she
did
even
her
walk
was
sinuous
he
had
married
her
when
they
both
were
young
through
his
persistent
habit
of
ignoring
her
she
had
been
dwarfed
into
a
nonentity
to
have
looked
at
the
woman
one
would
have
said
that
hers
was
a
distinctive
personality
unbelievably
suppressed
it
would
not
have
been
possible
for
any
one
living
with
jasper
wald
to
have
asserted
himself
perhaps
she
had
learned
that
years
before
certainly
his
was
the
character
which
predominated
domineered
through
the
encouragement
of
his
own
egoism
her
attitude
toward
him
was
perpetually
one
of
she
stood
for
his
conceit
in
a
peculiarly
passive
way
if
it
ever
irritated
her
she
gave
no
sign
and
he
kept
right
on
with
his
manner
of
patronizing
her
stupidity
that
is
when
he
noticed
her
at
all
she
was
essential
to
him
in
so
far
as
she
supplied
all
of
his
physical
wants
those
in
themselves
were
of
great
importance
to
jasper
wald
there
was
no
companionship
between
them
jasper
wald
could
never
have
indulged
in
companionship
of
any
kind
he
had
put
himself
far
beyond
that
to
his
way
of
thinking
he
was
a
super
being
who
had
no
need
whatever
for
the
rest
of
man
he
was
all
if
there
had
ever
been
love
between
them
in
those
days
when
they
had
first
come
together
they
had
both
of
them
completely
lost
sight
of
it
he
in
his
complacent
conceit
she
in
her
monotonous
negation
and
as
time
went
on
and
as
his
work
became
greater
jasper
wald
grew
even
further
away
from
the
sort
of
thing
he
wrote
so
that
it
was
more
than
ever
difficult
for
those
who
knew
him
to
disassociate
him
from
his
writings
there
was
always
the
temptation
to
try
to
find
some
of
his
literary
idealism
in
himself
to
find
some
of
his
prosaic
realism
in
his
works
on
one
occasion
delafield
his
publisher
came
to
him
to
the
house
on
peach
tree
road
it
was
a
peculiarity
of
jasper
wald
to
persistently
refuse
any
request
to
leave
his
home
it
was
the
one
thing
about
which
he
was
superstitious
he
had
never
by
word
or
thought
attributed
his
success
to
anyone
or
anything
outside
of
himself
he
had
made
his
name
in
this
house
and
he
would
not
leave
it
delafield
visit
came
at
a
time
just
after
jasper
wald
last
book
had
been
published
sitting
in
the
square
simply
furnished
living
room
delafield
for
all
his
enthusiasm
for
the
author
had
felt
a
certain
inexplicable
disgust
it
great
wald
there
genius
to
it
we
have
it
run
through
its
second
edition
a
week
after
we
put
it
on
the
market
i
do
doubt
that
jasper
wald
tone
was
in
his
confidence
not
for
a
moment
delafield
bit
off
the
end
of
his
cigar
when
will
your
next
one
be
ready
he
asked
it
abruptly
oh
i
do
know
jasper
wald
had
pulled
leisurely
at
his
pipe
whenever
i
make
up
my
mind
to
it
i
suppose
it
going
to
be
the
biggest
thing
i
tackled
yet
delafield
well
delafield
got
up
to
go
it
ca
be
too
soon
you
have
a
barrel
of
money
before
you
get
done
genius
does
usually
pay
that
way
either
but
he
could
not
help
himself
you
got
the
knack
of
the
thing
heaven
knows
where
you
get
it
but
it
the
knowledge
we
all
need
that
comes
from
he
broke
off
quite
suddenly
as
ellen
wald
came
into
the
room
i
did
know
she
said
uncertainly
i
thought
you
were
alone
my
wife
delafield
jasper
wald
made
the
introduction
impatiently
ellen
this
is
delafield
who
publishes
my
books
she
came
toward
them
and
held
out
her
hand
to
delafield
he
could
not
help
but
noticing
her
odd
manner
of
moving
good
evening
she
said
delafield
had
not
known
that
jasper
wald
was
married
it
was
almost
impossible
for
him
to
imagine
anyone
living
with
this
man
he
looked
at
the
woman
curiously
he
had
the
feeling
that
her
individuality
had
been
stultified
it
did
not
surprise
him
jasper
wald
could
have
accomplished
that
it
would
have
been
difficult
to
have
matched
him
with
as
flagrantly
material
a
person
as
he
himself
was
only
that
sort
of
person
would
have
stood
a
chance
with
him
any
other
would
have
had
to
fall
flat
she
had
fallen
flat
delafield
knew
that
the
moment
he
looked
at
her
why
i
did
know
delafield
took
her
hand
in
his
you
never
told
me
wald
that
you
were
married
did
i
no
of
course
but
about
the
new
book
delafield
delafield
dropped
her
hand
he
had
never
felt
anything
quite
as
inert
as
that
hand
it
impressed
the
nondescript
quality
of
her
upon
him
even
more
strongly
than
had
her
appearance
your
husband
has
promised
me
another
book
mrs
wald
he
spoke
slowly
he
felt
he
had
to
speak
that
way
or
she
would
not
understand
him
your
husband
is
a
great
author
mrs
wald
yes
why
do
you
say
genius
delafield
and
be
done
with
it
why
you
make
a
clean
breast
of
it
with
genius
i
got
to
be
going
delafield
felt
a
strange
irritation
the
man
was
a
fool
for
what
reason
under
the
sun
could
this
woman
with
those
half
closed
eyes
let
herself
be
dominated
by
him
the
two
of
them
got
on
his
nerves
wo
you
stay
to
dinner
jasper
wald
was
obviously
anxious
for
a
chance
to
speak
of
himself
sorry
wald
i
got
to
be
getting
on
delafield
still
watched
the
woman
she
stood
there
quite
silent
i
thought
you
might
have
something
to
say
about
that
book
of
mine
no
there
nothing
more
delafield
started
for
the
door
i
just
told
you
that
it
full
of
the
sort
of
knowledge
all
of
us
are
in
need
of
i
ca
say
more
you
know
i
suppose
that
knowledge
is
what
constitutes
genius
but
he
was
staring
now
full
into
those
bulging
blue
eyes
lord
man
where
where
get
it
from
glancing
at
the
woman
delafield
saw
that
she
was
looking
straight
at
him
her
eyes
met
his
in
a
way
which
he
was
completely
at
a
loss
to
explain
there
was
something
eerie
about
it
where
does
he
get
it
she
repeated
his
question
stupidly
and
once
again
the
heavy
lids
came
down
over
those
strange
green
eyes
hiding
all
expression
jasper
wald
drew
in
his
breath
i
write
it
he
said
after
that
delafield
left
them
both
severely
alone
the
woman
puzzled
him
he
could
not
tolerate
the
man
jasper
wald
and
he
could
not
for
worlds
have
the
genius
of
jasper
wald
hurt
or
slighted
in
any
way
he
knew
how
big
it
was
it
often
left
him
breathless
but
the
man
he
would
have
liked
to
have
hit
him
that
day
in
the
living
room
in
the
house
on
peach
tree
road
to
have
kicked
him
into
some
sort
of
a
realization
as
to
what
an
utter
little
rat
he
was
and
so
because
of
his
physical
people
stayed
away
from
jasper
wald
not
that
he
avoided
people
not
that
he
wanted
to
live
the
life
of
a
recluse
he
never
made
any
attempt
to
conceal
his
living
from
the
general
public
he
was
too
much
of
the
egoist
to
attempt
concealment
of
any
kind
so
his
life
was
known
to
any
man
woman
or
child
who
cared
for
the
knowledge
his
life
of
narrow
selfishness
of
tranquil
complacency
of
colossal
conceit
and
of
genius
he
always
wrote
in
the
evenings
did
jasper
wald
and
often
he
would
keep
at
his
writing
well
on
into
the
morning
he
liked
to
sit
there
in
the
square
living
room
with
its
wide
window
that
gave
out
upon
peach
tree
road
when
he
had
first
moved
into
the
house
as
an
obscure
journalist
he
had
placed
the
desk
against
the
window
ledge
so
that
he
could
look
directly
out
of
the
window
without
moving
and
he
had
kept
the
desk
there
he
was
just
a
bit
insistent
about
it
then
too
he
liked
the
blind
up
so
that
he
could
stare
out
into
the
evening
and
at
the
house
opposite
for
all
his
impossible
vanity
there
must
have
been
imbedded
deep
down
in
the
small
hard
soul
of
the
man
some
excessive
frantic
hunger
of
by
others
a
potential
desire
to
accomplish
an
assertion
of
self
that
could
in
no
way
be
denied
a
fundamental
energy
which
had
in
some
way
made
possible
the
work
but
which
he
could
never
admit
for
fear
that
it
might
evade
the
importance
of
himself
the
house
opposite
interested
him
tremendously
sitting
there
in
an
abstract
fit
of
musing
he
watched
it
as
one
subconsciously
watches
a
place
that
has
one
attention
to
all
outward
appearances
the
house
across
the
way
was
heavily
boarded
up
and
closed
it
had
always
been
closed
since
the
time
that
jasper
wald
had
come
to
live
in
peach
tree
road
yet
every
evening
in
the
window
directly
facing
his
he
had
seen
the
shadow
of
a
man
moving
to
and
fro
to
and
fro
beyond
the
drawn
blind
he
would
sit
there
watching
the
dark
undefined
shadow
until
he
felt
that
he
had
to
work
and
then
the
whole
thing
would
slip
from
his
mind
until
the
following
evening
when
he
would
again
be
at
his
desk
strangely
enough
he
had
never
mentioned
the
presence
of
the
shadow
to
anyone
there
was
about
it
a
certain
mysterious
unreality
that
much
he
jasper
wald
was
capable
of
knowing
it
was
the
one
thing
outside
of
himself
that
gripped
at
his
intelligence
during
all
those
six
years
he
had
waited
at
his
desk
each
night
for
the
coming
of
the
shadow
and
when
it
came
he
had
started
to
work
he
never
explained
the
thing
to
himself
he
never
thought
he
had
to
explain
anything
to
his
own
understanding
had
he
tried
he
would
have
been
utterly
at
a
loss
for
an
explanation
so
jasper
wald
had
come
to
look
upon
the
shadow
as
a
sign
of
luck
a
thing
that
epitomized
his
genius
to
himself
naturally
it
had
not
always
been
that
way
the
first
time
that
jasper
wald
had
felt
the
shadow
he
had
experienced
an
uncanny
sense
of
terror
that
had
been
before
he
had
really
seen
it
he
had
been
standing
there
beside
the
window
just
after
he
and
ellen
had
moved
into
their
home
looking
out
at
the
closed
house
opposite
he
had
felt
a
queer
oppression
which
he
readily
interpreted
as
the
vibration
of
his
new
environment
when
the
thing
had
persisted
he
had
become
a
bit
uneasy
the
sense
of
oppression
so
utterly
unknown
to
him
had
changed
to
one
which
grew
upon
him
as
if
he
were
being
forced
out
of
himself
in
some
uncanny
manner
there
was
about
it
all
a
curious
sensation
of
remoteness
of
self
and
at
the
same
time
a
weird
consciousness
of
the
haunting
permeation
of
something
invisible
and
dynamic
he
never
thought
back
to
that
evening
without
a
positive
horror
the
whole
thing
was
so
completely
alien
to
him
it
had
been
with
a
great
sense
of
relief
that
he
had
finally
been
able
to
see
and
to
rivet
his
attention
upon
the
shadow
there
against
the
blind
of
the
house
opposite
he
had
clinched
his
thought
onto
it
and
the
other
thing
had
left
him
had
lessened
in
its
maddening
oppression
that
evening
he
had
started
to
write
he
had
felt
that
writing
was
a
thing
he
had
to
do
it
was
entirely
because
of
his
first
fear
that
he
kept
the
knowledge
of
the
shadow
to
himself
cock
sure
as
he
was
of
himself
thoroughly
certain
of
his
genius
and
inordinately
vain
of
his
success
there
was
one
thing
about
it
all
that
jasper
wald
could
not
quite
make
out
not
for
worlds
would
he
have
admitted
it
still
there
was
the
one
thing
and
the
one
thing
was
that
jasper
wald
could
not
understand
the
kind
of
thought
behind
what
he
himself
wrote
it
was
late
one
summer
evening
that
jasper
wald
sat
at
his
desk
in
the
square
living
room
his
pen
was
in
his
hand
a
pile
of
blank
paper
made
a
white
patch
on
the
dark
wood
before
him
his
blue
eyes
that
bulged
a
bit
looked
out
into
the
graying
half
light
the
green
of
the
lawn
was
matted
with
dark
shadows
a
mist
of
shadows
were
pressed
into
the
faint
lined
leaves
of
the
two
drooping
willow
trees
on
either
side
of
the
wicker
gate
an
unreal
light
held
in
the
sky
his
eyes
were
fixed
on
the
one
window
of
the
house
opposite
with
his
pen
in
his
hand
jasper
wald
waited
from
somewhere
in
the
house
came
the
chimes
of
a
clock
striking
the
half
hour
starting
from
his
chair
jasper
wald
went
to
the
side
of
the
desk
and
leaned
far
out
of
the
window
a
wave
of
heat
came
up
to
him
from
the
earth
his
eyes
stared
intently
at
the
window
opposite
the
door
behind
him
was
thrown
open
he
turned
to
see
ellen
tall
not
ungraceful
figure
standing
in
the
doorway
her
two
hands
grasped
the
bowl
of
a
lighted
lamp
i
do
need
that
jasper
wald
told
it
to
her
impatiently
she
came
a
step
into
the
room
it
dark
in
here
jasper
but
i
do
need
any
more
light
ellen
i
do
need
it
i
tell
you
it
dark
in
here
jasper
all
right
then
put
the
thing
down
i
ca
take
up
my
time
arguing
with
you
how
can
a
man
write
in
a
place
like
this
anyway
have
you
no
consideration
must
i
always
be
disturbed
have
you
no
respect
for
genius
she
came
a
step
further
toward
the
center
of
the
room
genius
jasper
my
genius
ellen
mine
he
watched
her
cross
the
room
with
that
odd
sinuous
moving
of
hers
and
place
the
lamp
in
the
center
of
his
desk
and
then
he
saw
her
go
to
a
chair
within
its
light
and
sitting
down
pick
up
some
sewing
which
she
had
left
there
he
went
back
and
sat
at
his
desk
he
had
made
up
his
mind
that
this
new
book
of
his
would
be
something
big
something
bigger
than
he
had
ever
done
before
he
wanted
to
write
a
stupendous
thing
he
caught
up
his
pen
and
dipped
it
in
the
ink
she
startled
him
with
a
quick
cough
ca
you
be
still
he
turned
toward
her
you
know
i
ca
write
if
i
bothered
you
do
have
to
sit
in
here
if
you
going
to
cough
your
head
off
there
plenty
of
other
rooms
in
the
house
she
half
rose
from
her
chair
want
me
to
go
oh
sit
there
he
muttered
irritably
only
for
heaven
sake
be
still
yes
jasper
all
of
his
books
had
brought
him
fame
but
this
one
this
one
would
bring
him
fame
with
something
else
this
book
would
be
the
great
work
that
would
show
to
people
the
staggering
power
of
one
man
mind
his
mind
his
eyes
that
stared
at
the
window
of
the
house
opposite
came
back
to
be
pile
of
blank
paper
which
made
a
white
patch
on
the
dark
wood
before
him
without
any
definite
idea
he
began
to
write
a
word
a
sentence
a
paragraph
he
tore
the
thing
up
without
stopping
to
read
it
ellen
voice
came
to
him
through
the
stillness
of
the
room
anything
wrong
jasper
wrong
what
should
be
wrong
i
do
know
he
began
to
write
again
he
looked
out
of
his
window
at
the
window
of
the
house
opposite
he
went
on
with
his
writing
till
he
had
covered
the
whole
page
again
he
tore
the
paper
up
and
threw
it
from
him
i
going
jasper
he
turned
to
see
her
standing
in
the
center
of
the
room
her
heavily
lidded
eyes
fixed
on
the
floor
i
told
you
you
could
stay
here
i
best
be
going
jasper
sit
down
over
there
and
do
be
still
i
seem
to
bother
you
you
have
started
to
write
is
it
because
here
jasper
you
he
snorted
contemptuously
what
you
got
to
do
with
it
i
do
know
she
said
quietly
and
she
went
back
to
her
chair
again
his
eyes
were
fixed
on
that
one
window
he
leaned
forward
quickly
his
hands
gripped
the
chair
arms
on
either
side
of
him
his
brows
drew
down
together
above
the
bulging
blue
eyes
thrown
on
the
clear
blank
of
the
window
blind
moving
to
and
fro
across
it
went
the
shadow
with
a
sharp
sigh
of
relief
jasper
wald
began
to
write
it
was
not
until
he
had
gotten
far
down
the
page
that
he
became
suddenly
conscious
of
ellen
standing
directly
behind
him
he
looked
over
at
the
window
the
shadow
was
still
there
what
is
it
what
want
the
lamplight
brought
out
her
features
good
and
very
regular
and
still
somewhat
nondescript
the
lamplight
showed
her
strange
green
eyes
and
beneath
the
heavy
lids
the
lamplight
brought
out
in
a
glinting
streak
the
expression
of
the
eyes
themselves
what
made
you
do
that
jasper
i
trying
to
write
you
keep
interrupting
me
what
are
you
talking
about
made
me
do
what
made
you
write
jasper
do
i
always
write
yes
jasper
always
all
of
a
sudden
like
that
well
what
of
it
what
makes
you
do
it
jasper
oh

me
alone

what
makes
you
do
it
jasper
of
course
i
know
well
what
my
it
my
inspiration
that
comes
she
spoke
slowly
every
night
when
you
look
out
of
the
window
that
how
it
comes
jasper
look
out
of
the
window
why
should
i
look
out
of
the
window
what
is
it
you
see
over
there
in
that
house
in
that
one
window
he
looked
across
the
way
at
the
shadow
moving
to
and
fro
against
the
window
blind
he
started
to
his
feet
so
suddenly
that
his
chair
crashed
to
the
floor
behind
him
he
faced
her
angrily
what
under
the
sun
the
matter
with
you
nothing
then
why
ca
you
leave
me
alone
i
want
to
know
jasper
you
do
know
what
you
want
yes
jasper
i
want
to
know
leave
the
room
he
said
furiously
leave
the
room
i
got
to
write
she
started
for
the
door
you
got
to
write
her
words
came
back
to
him
across
the
length
of
the
room
with
a
curious
insistence
got
to
write
jasper
he
waited
until
the
door
closed
behind
her
and
then
he
went
back
to
his
desk
what
had
she
meant
by
that
last
question
of
hers
did
she
know
that
he
had
to
write
did
she
realize
that
he
had
to
write
and
this
book
of
his
this
book
that
was
to
be
the
biggest
thing
that
he
had
yet
done
ellen
he
called
ellen
he
heard
her
feet
coming
toward
him
along
the
passageway
she
came
back
into
the
room
as
though
nothing
had
happened
yes
jasper
what
what
did
you
mean
by
that
ellen
by
what
you
just
said
she
faced
him
in
the
center
of
the
room
i
been
wanting
to
tell
you
jasper
well
her
hands
hung
quite
quietly
at
her
sides
i
put
up
with
you
for
a
long
time
jasper
i
have
said
very
much
you
know
what
he
stuttered
oh
yes
she
went
on
evenly
if
it
were
for
your
vanity
you
have
realized
long
ago
what
a
contemptible
little
man
you
really
are
he
interrupted
her
ellen
his
tone
was
astonished
you
so
full
of
yourself
that
you
ca
see
anything
else
you
so
full
of
that
genius
of
yours
you
do
have
to
speak
of
that
you
can
leave
that
out
of
it
you
nothing
to
do
with
it
with
my
genius
your
genius
she
laughed
then
it
your
genius
jasper
that
has
nothing
to
do
with
you
nothing
to
do
with
me
no
jasper
i
have
been
blind
blind
i
seen
jasper
sitting
here
night
after
night
in
this
room
with
you
i
seen
what
over
there
in
the
house
opposite
you
mean
and
you
ca
write
without
it
jasper
you
could
write
before
and
you
ca
write
now
without
it
it
is
you
it
is
you
who
writes
it
something
something
working
through
you
and
you
call
it
your
own
jasper
you
a
fool
ellen
how
dare
you
dare
she
spoke
the
word
disdainfully
he
had
never
in
his
whole
life
seen
her
this
way
he
had
never
thought
to
see
her
like
this
but
then
he
had
never
given
ellen
much
thought
of
any
kind
it
you
who
the
fool
he
was
furious
it
i
who
always
been
the
brains
if
you
could
you
have
hampered
me
with
your
stupidity
but
you
could
i
shut
you
quite
outside
i
nurtured
my
own
genius
if
have
left
things
to
you
i
have
been
down
and
out
by
now
and
all
there
is
to
it
no
her
voice
rang
through
the
room
i
wo
let
you
say
that
jasper
i
tell
you
the
truth
now
and
take
it
or
leave
it
as
you
will
you
wo
be
able
to
get
away
from
it
not
if
i
tell
you
the
truth
jasper
there
be
no
getting
away
from
it
truth
about
what
you
and
your
genius
i
would
have
told
you
but
it
no
good
going
on
like
this
i
thought
there
was
some
hope
for
you
i
could
think
any
human
being
would
be
as
as
disgustingly
material
as
you
are
why
if
you
have
a
soul
but
you
have
and
i
thought
god
how
i
hoped
he
started
to
speak
he
could
not
find
his
voice
she
went
on
presently
in
that
quiet
monotonous
voice
which
had
been
hers
for
so
many
years
you
left
me
alone
i
would
have
complained
i
would
complain
now
if
you
had
some
excuse
for
it
it
all
made
me
different
there
no
use
in
telling
you
how
you
could
understand
but
i
got
to
feeling
things
i
never
felt
before
and
then
i
saw
things
and
after
a
while
i
found
i
could
bring
those
things
to
me
and
that
night
the
first
night
we
moved
in
here
he
interrupted
her
in
spite
of
himself
what
of
that
night
what
that
night
when
you
were
standing
there
at
the
window
i
got
down
on
my
knees
and
prayed
i
brought
something
to
you
that
night
and
you
called
the
genius
yours
she
broke
off
and
was
silent
for
a
second
i
brought
it
to
you
because
i
wanted
you
to
be
great
i
thought
with
all
that
energy
of
yours
for
writing
that
if
it
could
work
through
you
you
be
big
but
you
were
too
small
for
it
you
tried
to
make
it
a
thing
of
your
own
and
i
held
on
to
it
for
six
years
i
kept
it
here
with
you
and
now
it
going
i
letting
it
go
back
again
you
too
small
you
ca
ever
be
anything
but
just
you
he
walked
over
to
his
desk
and
sank
down
into
the
arm
chair
i
do
know
what
you
talking
about
you
do
and
if
you
do
why
do
you
look
out
of
the
window
there
every
night
why
wait
for
it
to
come
before
you
start
to
write
his
exclamation
was
involuntary
the
shadow
yes
its
shadow
from
this
room
where
i
kept
it
casting
over
there
its
shadow
so
that
was
what
she
meant
the
thing
that
epitomized
his
genius
to
himself
the
shadow
that
he
had
come
to
look
upon
as
a
sign
of
luck
but
it
was
nonsense
it
was
possible
not
such
rot
as
that
it
was
his
mind
the
big
creative
mind
of
him
that
wrote
have
you
said
all
you
going
to
say
for
a
second
her
gaze
met
his
and
then
the
heavy
lids
came
down
again
over
those
strange
green
eyes
hiding
all
expression
yes
jasper
he
looked
out
of
the
window
his
eyes
stared
through
the
night
beyond
the
two
shadowy
drooping
willow
trees
on
either
side
of
the
wicker
gate
and
over
at
the
house
opposite
he
caught
his
breath
the
yellow
light
from
the
lamp
on
his
desk
played
across
the
clear
blank
of
the
window
blind
across
the
way
the
shadow
had
gone
ellen
his
voice
was
hoarse
ellen
what
is
it
it
not
there
ellen
six
years
now
why
ellen
she
went
and
sat
down
in
the
chair
beside
the
desk
yes
it
is
there
i
tell
you
i
thought
it
could
make
no
difference
to
you
it
was
lucky
ellen
oh
lucky
jasper
he
made
an
effort
to
pull
himself
together
it
wo
make
any
difference
to
me
not
to
my
writing
not
to
my
genius
after
the
silence
of
a
moment
her
voice
came
to
him
in
its
low
even
measure
then
write
of
course
his
tone
was
high
pitched
hysterical
naturally
write
write
jasper
he
caught
up
his
pen
and
dipped
it
in
the
ink
he
drew
the
white
pile
of
paper
nearer
to
him
jasper
how
can
i
work
if
you
do
stop
talking
how
can
i
do
anything
how
can
i
write
are
you
writing
jasper
are
you
he
did
not
answer
her
because
she
went
on
very
quietly
it
gone
back
jasper
it
gone
now
his
pen
went
to
and
fro
to
and
fro
across
the
page
his
figure
was
bent
well
over
the
desk
every
now
and
again
without
moving
his
bulging
blue
eyes
would
lift
themselves
to
the
clear
blank
blind
of
the
window
opposite
and
then
they
would
come
back
and
fix
themselves
intently
upon
the
white
page
of
paper
which
he
was
so
busily
covering
with
stupid
meaningless
little
drawings
the
effigy
evans
is
upstairs
in
the
library
genevieve
evans
hurried
through
the
hall
and
up
the
steps
she
pulled
off
her
gloves
as
she
went
she
rolled
them
into
a
hard
small
ball
and
tucked
them
automatically
in
her
muff
she
had
hoped
that
she
would
get
there
before
him
she
had
been
thinking
of
that
all
during
the
quick
rush
home
she
would
have
liked
to
have
had
a
moment
to
pull
herself
together
after
what
she
had
been
through
she
wondered
if
she
could
keep
from
going
all
to
pieces
it
could
not
be
helped
she
did
not
even
know
if
she
cared
a
lot
about
it
she
was
quite
numbed
he
was
there
ahead
of
her
there
in
the
library
of
all
the
rooms
in
the
house
that
he
should
have
chosen
the
one
so
rarely
used
the
room
she
hated
at
the
door
of
the
library
she
paused
breathless
for
a
second
she
thought
the
long
dark
room
empty
then
she
saw
ernest
he
was
standing
in
one
of
the
deep
windows
a
short
squat
figure
black
against
the
dim
yellow
of
the
velvet
curtains
one
hand
held
his
cigarette
the
fingers
of
the
other
hand
tapped
unevenly
on
the
window
glass
she
knew
then
that
he
must
have
seen
her
come
into
the
house
ernest
he
turned
i
been
waiting
for
you
he
told
her
with
studied
indifference
where
you
been
jenny
she
took
a
step
into
the
room
i
sorry
ernest
i
did
know
you
be
home
so
early
it
late
where
you
been
she
wondered
why
she
should
bother
avoiding
answering
his
question
oh
out
her
tone
was
vague
no
he
scoffed
i
would
have
guessed
it
really
i
would
she
loosened
the
fur
from
her
neck
and
tossed
it
onto
the
center
table
do
ernest
do
what
jenny
she
sank
down
into
the
depths
of
the
nearest
chair
oh
nothing
her
hands
clinched
themselves
nothing
he
came
and
stood
quite
close
to
her
he
glanced
quickly
at
her
puffing
the
while
at
his
cigarette
she
thought
he
looked
wicked
and
pagan
hideous
and
yellow
behind
the
rising
smoke
his
narrow
eyes
peered
at
her
well
jenny
out
with
it
my
girl
where
you
been
she
looked
away
from
him
her
face
was
pale
in
the
twilight
shadowed
room
he
had
seen
how
wide
and
strange
her
eyes
were
she
made
up
her
mind
then
that
it
was
not
worth
bothering
about
she
would
tell
him
the
truth
she
did
not
care
how
he
took
it
i
been
to
see
to
see
father
she
whispered
the
words
her
eyes
wavered
back
to
his
face
good
heavens
he
laughed
harshly
after
all
you
said
yes
rather
a
joke
that
no
there
was
anything
funny
about
it
well
was
the
old
man
surprised
no
he
told
me
he
knew
i
come
some
time
wise
old
beggar
daniel
drare
her
breath
came
quickly
unevenly
he
a
devil
ernest
that
what
he
is
he
he
interrupted
her
not
so
fast
jenny
you
went
there
to
see
him
you
know
but
ernest
i
could
stand
it
any
longer
i
simply
could
he
walked
deliberately
over
to
the
screened
fireplace
and
tossed
his
cigarette
into
it
why
go
to
him
you
know
why
i
went
why
she
had
felt
right
along
that
he
must
be
made
to
understand
it
she
could
not
see
why
he
had
not
known
before
oh
do
pretend
any
more
i
sick
of
it
you
know
i
sick
of
it
his
brows
drew
together
in
an
angry
frown
sick
of
what
eh
jenny
her
eyes
crept
away
from
his
and
went
miserably
about
the
room
they
took
no
note
of
the
rare
old
furniture
of
the
dark
paneled
walls
of
the
color
mellowed
tapestries
she
sat
looking
at
it
all
blindly
then
her
eyes
raised
themselves
a
bit
she
found
herself
staring
at
the
picture
hung
just
above
the
wood
carved
mantel
the
famous
picture
the
work
of
the
great
artist
the
picture
before
which
she
had
stood
and
hated
and
hated
the
picture
which
was
the
pride
and
portrait
of
her
father
daniel
drare
she
got
to
her
feet
i
sick
of
you
she
said
it
quite
calmly
and
i
sick
of
him
she
nodded
her
head
in
the
direction
of
the
portrait
i
do
anything
to
get
away
from
both
of
you
anything
he
smiled
you
not
get
away
from
me
he
told
her
you
the
one
word
was
contemptuous
you
do
really
count
what
mean
he
still
smiled
i
mean
what
i
say
her
voice
was
tired
you
nothing
nothing
but
oh
a
kind
of
a
henchman
to
him
that
all
you
are
not
that
he
needs
you
he
does
need
any
one
he
too
unscrupulously
powerful
for
that
he
never
needed
any
one
not
you
nor
me
he
did
even
need
my
mother
he
broke
her
heart
and
let
her
die
because
he
did
need
her
i
think
you
know
he
like
that
you
no
different
where
concerned
than
the
others
after
all
i
your
husband
that
the
ghastly
part
of
it
you
my
husband
you
only
my
husband
because
of
him
you
knew
that
when
i
married
you
did
you
you
knew
the
lies
he
told
me
when
he
wanted
me
to
marry
you
you
never
contradicted
them
and
i
was
too
silly
too
young
to
know
i
wanted
to
get
away
from
it
all
and
from
him
i
could
guess
that
you
think
ernest
if
it
had
been
for
those
lies
i
have
married
you
do
you
oh
i
do
know
i
usually
get
what
i
want
jenny
and
why
do
you
get
it
why
perhaps
because
i
want
it
she
laughed
harshly
because
daniel
drare
gets
it
for
you
because
he
had
everything
all
his
life
because
he
behind
you
for
the
time
being
that
why
and
what
if
it
is
my
god
she
muttered
i
ca
make
you
understand
i
ca
even
talk
to
either
of
you
you
went
to
see
him
i
went
to
him
to
tell
him
i
could
stand
it
any
longer
i
begged
him
to
help
me
just
this
once
i
told
him
i
could
go
on
this
way
i
told
him
i
could
bear
any
more
i
told
him
the
truth
that
i
go
mad
what
did
he
say
eh
jenny
for
a
second
her
eyes
closed
he
laughed
laughed
of
course
there
no
course
about
it
i
serious
deadly
serious
do
be
a
fool
jenny
if
you
ask
me
i
say
you
were
mighty
well
off
your
father
gives
you
everything
you
want
your
husband
gives
you
everything
you
want
there
is
a
man
in
the
whole
city
who
has
more
power
than
daniel
drare
or
more
money
for
that
matter
you
ought
to
be
jolly
well
satisfied
she
waited
a
full
moment
before
speaking
maybe
i
a
fool
ernest
maybe
i
am
a
weak
helpless
kind
of
a
fool
but
i
not

kind
of
a
life

more

to
make
money
the
kind
of
things
you
proud
of
they
prey
on
me
ernest
nothing
about
all
this
that
clean
it
making
me
ill
the
rottenness
of
this
sort
of
living
i
not
happy

that
mean
anything
to
you
nonsense
you
no
reason
for
not
being
happy
the
trouble
with
you
jenny
is
that
you
too
lively
an
imagination
oh
no
ernest
i
got
to
get
away
somewhere
anywhere
just
by
myself
i
do
love
you
ernest
you
do
really
love
me
it
only
because
i
daniel
drare
daughter
that
you
married
me
it
was
just
his
wealth
and
his
power
and
and
is
unscrupulous
self
that
fascinated
you

a
lot
of
ways

little
ways

big
enough
to
be
really
like
him
let
me
go
ernest
before
it
too
late
let
me
go
he
came
and
put
a
hand
on
her
shoulder
i
never
let
you
go
he
said
you
must
she
whispered
you
got
to
let
me
just
to
get
away
from
all
this
i
never
been
away
in
all
my
life
he
never
let
me
go
either
unconsciously
her
eyes
went
up
to
the
picture
the
full
red
face
with
the
hard
lines
in
it
the
thick
sensual
lips
the
small
cunning
eyes
that
laughed
the
ponderous
heavy
set
of
the
figure
the
big
powerful
hands
his
gaze
followed
after
hers
and
very
suddenly
he
left
her
side
he
walked
over
to
the
mantel
funny
he
muttered
to
himself
jolly
strange
that
her
fingers
clutched
at
her
breast
ernest
what
you
doing
can
you
see
anything
wrong
here
jenny
he
was
looking
up
at
the
portrait
wrong
she
said
it
beneath
her
breath
wrong
he
reached
up
a
hand
he
drew
his
fingers
across
the
canvas
by
jove
his
voice
was
excited
so
it
is
thought
i
was
crazy
when
could
it
have
happened
eh
ever
notice
this
jenny
she
could
not
take
her
eyes
from
his
hand
that
was
going
over
and
over

sense

in
this
light
anyway
how
he
did
not
let
her
finish
come
here
slowly
she
went
toward
him
what
is
it
ernest
what
a
crack
his
hand
still
worked
across
it
in
the
paint
here
along
the
arm
or
a
cut
or
something
how
under
the
sun
could
it
have
happened
we
got
to
have
it
fixed
somehow
never
heard
of
such
a
thing
before
old
daniel
drare
be
as
sore
as
a
crab
if
ever
he
gets
wind
of
this
it
be
like
hurting
him
to
touch
this
portrait
he
certainly
does
think
the
world
of
it
how
could
it
have
happened
that
what
i
like
to
know
i
i
do
know
what
you
talking
about
i
here
ca
you
see
it
it
as
plain
as
the
nose
on
your
face
along
the
arm
it
a
cut
right
into
the
canvas
you
can
run
your
finger
in
it
give
me
your
hand
she
shrank
back
from
him
no
no
ernest
he
stared
at
her
intently

look
seedy

go
up
and
lie
down

he
started
for

door
she
blocked
his
way

again

a
sensible
girl
jenny

your
father
had
to
laugh
at
you
when
you
told
him
the
way

it
out
with
daniel
drare

stick
it
out
with
me

her
voice

singsong

his
strength

his
strength
she
droned
i
enough
strength
to
keep
you
here
if
that
what
you
mean
no
it
not
what
i
mean
a
puzzled
look
crept
across
her
face
her
eyes
were
suddenly
furtive
maybe
i
do
know
what
i
mean
but
i
think
it
you
i

a
moment
she
said
when
he

went
over
to
the
window
she
stood
there
gazing
out
into
the
darkened
quiet
she
was
trembling
in
every
limb
now
and
again
she
would
half
turn
her
eyes
would
go
slowly
warily
toward
the
portrait
hanging
there
over
the
mantel
and
then
they
would
hurry
away
again

started
nervously
when

his
kind
of
things
she
swayed
to
her
feet
her
steps
were
short
and
uncertain
her
whole
body
reeled
her
face
was
blanched
drained
of
all
color
her
fingers
trembled
wide
spread
at
her
sides
she
was
quivering
from
head
to
foot
only
her
eyes
were
steady
her
eyes
wide
and
dilated
that
were
riveted
on
the
portrait
hanging
there
above
the
wood
carved
mantel
she
backed
toward
the
door
her
eyes
glued
to
the
picture
her
shaking
fingers
fumbling
behind
her
found
the
key
and
turned
it
feeling
her
way
with
her
hands
her
distended
eyes
still
fixed
on
that
one
thing
she
got
to
the
center
table
it
took
her
a
while
to
pull
open
the
drawer
her
breath
came
raspingly
as
if
she
had
been
running
the
old
venetian
dagger
with
the
cracked
jeweled
handle
was
between
her
fingers
very
slowly
now
she
went
toward
the
fireplace
the
electric
light
flared
over
the
colored
gems
that
studded
the
handle
of
the
dagger
giving
out
small
quick
rays
of
blue
and
red
and
green
i
angry
she
whispered
hoarsely
i
i
very
angry
with
you
you
no
right
no
right
to
ruin
my
life
and
laugh
you
did
laugh
at
me
her
eyes
stared
up
at
the
full
red
face
with
the
hard
lines
in
it
up
at
the
thick
sensual
lips
up
at
the
cunning
eyes
at
the
ponderous
figure
the
powerful
hands
why
do
you
laugh
now
you
are
afraid
are
you
you
are
afraid
of
anything
not
of
me
are
you
daniel
drare
you
done
your
best
to
keep
me
under
your
power
you
stood
behind
ernest
to
keep
me
under
your
power
you
not
afraid
of
me
why
do
you
laugh
daniel
drare
her
right
hand
that
held
the
dagger
raised
itself
laugh
daniel
drare
laugh
she
stood
there
under
the
portrait
her
left
hand
went
stiffly
out
feeling
over
the
long
cut
in
the
painted
arm
angry
last
night
she
whispered
and
it
hurt
you
daniel
drare
i
you
for
a
second
her
eyes
went
up
to
the
dagger
held
there
above
her
head
the
dagger
with
the
thousand
colored
gleams
pointing
from
it
she
gave
a
quick
choking
laugh
i
laugh
at
you
daniel
drare
with
all
her
strength
she
drove
the
dagger
into
the
heart
of
the
canvas
she
staggered
back
to
the
center
of
the
room
there
was
a
gaping
rent
in
the
portrait
she
laughed
again
stupidly
her
laughter
trailed
off
and
stopped
she
stood
there
waiting
once
she
thought
some
one
paused
outside
the
door
her
hands
were
up
across
her
eyes
motionless
she
waited
suddenly
she
gave
a
quick
start
out
there
in
the
hall
a
telephone
had
rung
she
heard
her
husband
answer
it
her
one
distinct
thought
was
that
he
must
have
been
on
his
way
out
for
dinner
his
unbelieving
cry
came
to
her
my
god
it
ca
her
fingers
were
pressed
into
her
ears
she
did
not
want
to
hear
the
rest
she
knew
it
the
faith
the
great
lady
fingered
the
pearls
that
circled
her
throat
quite
true
she
murmured
and
a
smile
crept
up
about
the
corners
of
her
lips
and
lingered
there
really
surprisingly
true
the
woman
with
the
white
hair
and
the
heavily
lidded
eyes
bent
a
bit
lower
over
her
charts
of
stars
and
constellations
this
year
she
went
on
in
that
low
undecided
voice
of
hers
this
year
madame
has
had
a
big
sorrow
it
was
the
loss
to
madame
of
a
young
man
he
was
tall
and
fair
like
madame
but
he
had
not
madame
eyes
he
had
courage
madame
and
a
soft
voice
always
a
soft
voice
he
went
on
this
young
one
with
his
courage
the
son
of
madame
died
in
the
early
spring
the
great
lady
hands
dropped
into
her
lap
and
clinched
there
the
knuckles
showing
white
and
round
as
her
fingers
strained
against
each
other
her
eyes
stared
hard
at
the
cracked
walls
up
over
the
low
ceiling
toward
the
back
of
the
small
room
that
was
divided
off
from
the
kitchen
by
a
plush
curtain
out
through
the
one
window
which
gave
on
to
the
street
she
could
just
see
the
heads
of
people
who
were
passing
and
the
faint
gray
shadows
of
the
late
evening
that
were
reaching
in
dark
spots
up
along
the
rough
white
walls
of
the
house
opposite
her
eyes
came
dazedly
back
to
the
room
and
the
chairs
and
the
table
before
which
she
sat
two
giant
tears
trickled
down
her
cheeks
the
smile
was
wiped
from
off
her
mouth
the
woman
with
the
white
hair
had
waited
there
is
another
here
he
is
perhaps
a
little
older
than
the
one
who
died
he
has
not
that
one
courage
he
is
very
careful
of
all
the
small
things
like
his
clothes
and
his
cigarettes
and
his
affections
the
big
things
he
has
never
known
his
eyes
are
like
the
eyes
of
madame
madame
has
this
son
in
the
war
now
no
no
the
great
lady
leaned
across
the
table
do
tell
me
not
that
he
i
could
bear
it
not
both
of
them
the
woman
with
the
white
hair
looked
up
quite
suddenly
from
her
charts
of
stars
and
constellations
a
pitying
quiver
shook
over
her
face
you
need
have
no
fear
madame
he
is
not
ready
it
is
a
wound
it
is
not
a
wound
that
gives
death
the
great
lady
fingered
her
pearls
again
you
you
quite
carried
me
away
for
a
moment
you
startled
me
i
regret
it
madame
perhaps
i
should
not
have
said
anything
of
course
you
should
have
i
told
you
that
when
i
came
in
did
i
i
said
i
wanted
to
hear
everything
everything
you
could
tell
me
ah
yes
madame
is
that
all
now
you
certain
that
you
not
forgotten
anything
and
she
pulled
at
her
gold
mesh
bag
which
was
studded
with
sapphires
it
is
everything
madame
unless
perhaps
madame
has
some
question
she
would
like
to
ask
of
me
the
great
lady
drew
her
money
out
and
tossed
it
on
the
table
the
woman
with
the
white
hair
and
those
heavily
lidded
eyes
did
not
touch
it
the
great
lady
got
to
her
feet
and
started
to
the
door
quite
suddenly
she
stopped
when
she
made
an
effort
to
steady
her
voice
when
will
this
thing
this
wound
come
the
woman
with
the
white
hair
bent
over
the
charts
again
and
then
she
caught
up
a
pencil
and
made
little
signs
on
the
yellow
paper
and
drew
a
triangle
through
them
and
across
them
at
the
points
the
fourth
day
of
the
second
month
from
now
madame
the
great
lady
came
back
to
the
table
and
stood
there
looking
down
how
do
you
do
it
the
woman
with
the
white
hair
stared
up
in
astonishment
madame
the
great
lady
ringed
fingers
spread
out
pale
and
taut
at
her
sides
the
jewels
of
the
rings
showed
in
dark
glistening
stains
against
the
white
of
her
skin
what
you
just
told
me
all
of
it
i
do
see
how
you
know
how
you
can
know
it
true
i
ca
understand
how
it
can
be
true
but
it
is
every
word
of
it
the
woman
with
the
white
hair
fingered
her
pencil
a
bit
wearily
but
of
course
madame
i
came
here
the
great
lady
spoke
hurriedly
i
do
know
why
i
came
only
i
did
think
i
would
have
believed
it
possible
i
tell
you
now
why
i
came
there
are
many
who
come
these
days
these
days
people
would
know
more
than
they
know
of
things
they
never
thought
of
before
madame
these
days
they
would
follow
a
bit
further
after
the
lives
that
have
been
broken
off
so
suddenly
they
are
impatient
because
they
can
not
see
where
they
have
never
before
looked
and
so
they
come
to
me
because
i
have
sat
staring
into
those
places
they
will
see
all
of
them
soon
they
are
going
on
further
because
they
must
know
these
days
they
must
know
the
great
lady
stood
quite
still
you
have
a
wonderful
gift
wonderful
it
is
not
mine
madame
the
great
lady
eyes
went
about
the
room
i
be
going
she
said
it
quite
late
her
eyes
took
in
the
cheap
poverty
of
the
mended
carpet
and
the
walls
and
the
chairs
the
woman
with
the
white
hair
got
to
her
feet
i
know
what
you
are
thinking
her
voice
was
low
if
i
can
do
this
for
others
you
think
why
should
i
not
be
able
to
do
everything
for
myself
if
i
can
tell
to
others
what
may
i
not
tell
to
myself
if
i
can
give
help
to
others
why
can
i
not
give
help
to
myself
the
silk
of
the
great
lady
dress
gave
out
a
faint
rustle
as
she
took
a
step
back
no
she
murmured
uncertainly
it
is
not
the
woman
voice
trembled
it
is
it
is
what
was
going
through
your
head
going
around
and
around
and
fearing
to
be
asked
but
i
will
answer
you
i
will
say
that
the
power
is
not
mine
it
is
the
power
that
is
given
to
me
it
is
not
for
myself
i
do
not
want
it
for
myself
i
shall
never
touch
it
for
myself
because
it
is
meant
for
others
to
help
others
and
that
is
all
mean
you
ca
see
things
for
yourself
the
great
lady
was
curious
but
of
course
i
can
see
it
is
that
which
sometimes
the
woman
with
the
white
hair
broke
off
abruptly
do
you
know
what
it
is
to
see
and
then
to
be
able
to
do
nothing
nothing
not
one
thing
how
can
you
i
can
madame
because
that
is
what
i
am
here
for
it
is
by
being
nothing
myself
that
this
thing
comes
through
me
so
that
i
can
feel
what
other
people
are
what
they
are
going
to
be
if
i
thought
only
of
me
i
would
be
so
full
of
myself
i
could
not
think
of
anything
else
it
is
from
thinking
a
little
bit
beyond
that
the
power
first
came
and
now
that
i
keep
on
thinking
away
from
the
nearest
layer
of
thought
it
works
through
me
and
i
can
help
it
is
the
wish
of
my
life
to
help
it
is
what
i
am
here
for
placed
in
the
field
they
told
it
to
me
the
voices
put
in
the
field
by
them
the
great
lady
shrugged
her
shoulders
the
woman
with
the
white
hair
pulled
herself
up
very
suddenly
there
was
a
quick
convulsive
movement
of
her
hands
and
for
a
short
second
her
eyes
closed
she
went
to
the
table
and
caught
the
money
between
her
fingers
and
dragged
it
across
the
red
cover
to
her
i
thank
madame
the
great
lady
walked
slowly
to
the
door
perhaps
some
day
i
be
back
perhaps
madame
the
great
lady
went
out
of
the
room
and
closed
the
door
behind
her
the
sound
of
her
footsteps
tapped
in
sharp
staccato
down
the
uncarpeted
stairs
and
died
away
into
the
stillness
the
creak
of
rusty
hinges
and
then
the
muffled
thud
of
the
front
door
swinging
to
in
the
street
the
soft
diminishing
whirr
of
a
motor
grew
fainter
and
was
gone
silence
the
woman
sank
into
a
chair
and
buried
her
face
between
her
two
shaking
hands
shadows
crept
up
against
the
uncurtained
window
and
pressed
quivering
against
the
pane
shadows
came
into
the
room
and
stretched
themselves
along
the
floor
shadows
reached
up
across
the
wall
and
over
the
chairs
and
the
table
shadows
spread
in
a
gray
moving
mass
over
the
still
figure
of
the
woman
a
young
girl
came
quickly
and
silently
through
the
curtain
that
partitioned
the
room
off
from
the
kitchen
maman
the
woman
did
not
move
i
had
not
thought
maman
that
you
were
alone
the
woman
slowly
drew
her
face
from
out
between
her
hands
she
looked
up
uncertainly
her
eyes
only
half
open
leave
me
angele
but
maman
supper
is
ready
let
it
wait
angele
the
girl
came
over
to
the
table
and
put
her
hand
on
the
shoulder
was
she
then
horrid
maman
the
woman
sighed
softly
it
is
not
that
angele
she
was
like
the
others
they
come
because
they
are
curious
something
perhaps
brings
them
here
but
they
do
not
know
that
they
are
only
curious
they
do
not
believe
i
tell
them
the
truth
they
are
shocked
for
a
little
moment
they
do
not
believe
angele
pauvre
petite
maman
you
are
tired
non
non
angele

have
jean

maman
the
woman
stared
up
into
the
girl
small
white
face
that
was
dimmed
with
shifting
shadows
the
woman
heavily
lidded
eyes
met
the
wide
dark
eyes
jean
he
will
be
home
to
eat
maman
soon
now
he
will
be
home
the
woman
passed
her
hands
again
and
again
over
her
forehead
and
then
she
held
them
with
the
tips
of
her
fingers
pressed
tight
to
her
temples
he
is
such
a
child
angele

and

time
maman
the
woman
caught
the
girl
fingers
between
her
own
answer

the
girl
looked
down
in
surprise
but
what
maman
the
woman
breath

quickly

is
a
baby

velvet
suit

angele
that
he
is
still
a
little
one
the
girl
threw
back
her
head
and
laughed
the
shadows
lay
like
long
dark
fingers
on
the
white
of
her
throat
of
course
he
is
young
too
young
even
now
when
they
take
the
young
you
have
no
need
to
worry
maman
maman
what
is
it
she
had
seen
the
sudden
look
in
the
woman
eyes
she
had
seen
her
head
stretch
forward
the
chin
pointing
the
mouth
a
little
open
maman
the
woman
hand
reached
out
in
a
gesture
commanding
silence
the
voices
the
woman
whispered
they
have
been
after
me
the
whole
day
the
voices
they
keep
coming
and
coming
to
me
i
have
not
been
able
to
think
for
the
voices
maman
you
say
you
are
coming
nearer
nearer

not
see
but

speaking
so
beautifully
you
say

petite
maman

will
make
yourself
ill
with
those
old
horoscopes
and
these
voices
petite
maman
have
you
not
done
enough
for
one
day
the
woman
paid
no
attention
to
her
she
did
not
seem
to
hear
the
girl
her
face
was
pale
there
were
faint
bluish
smudges
about
her
mouth
and
nostrils
you
want
i
can
not
can
not
understand
what
you
want
i
trying
to
understand
i
trying
hard
if
you
will
tell
it
to
me
again
and
slowly
with
patience
it
is
better
now
so
that
is
it
more
slowly
if
you
can
of
course
is
it
that
you
wish
to
know
of
course
i
shall
give
you
what
you
want
i
always
give
you
what
you
want
i
do
my
best
for
that
you
want
the
woman
eyes
were
closed
she
was
breathing
deeply
her
whole
figure
was
tense
the
girl
stood
beside
her
a
puzzled
half
incredulous
look
coming
into
her
face
i
should
look
it
does
no
good
to
look
i
can
never
see
beyond
the
wood
i
should
look
what
wood
now
is
it
perhaps
that
you
mean
gate
swings
to
and
fro
now
you
want
this
moment
the
door
was
flung
wide
open
at
the
noise
the
woman
slowly
opened
her
eyes
staring
blindly
before
her
you
want
she
murmured
a
boy
stood
in
the
doorway
he
was
slight
and
young
his
face
was
small
and
rather
like
the
girl
face
and
his
dark
eyes
were
set
far
apart
like
her
eyes
through
the
gray
of
the
massing
shadows
gleamed
the
brass
buttons
of
his
uniform
the
girl
sprang
forward
jean
maman
the
boy
came
a
step
into
the
room
see
maman
hush
jean
the
girl
turned
to
gaze
at
the
woman
sitting
there
with
that
stony
frozen
stare
staying
in
her
eyes
maman
they
have
taken
me
at
last
oh
for
a
second
the
girl
forgot
the
woman
but
i
am
proud
of
you
maman

wear
the
uniform
they
will
let
me
go
now
i
knew
they
would
take
me
sooner
or
later
i
knew
they
would
have
to
are
you
glad
the
girl
remembered
and
interrupted
him
be
still
jean
the
boy
stood
looking
from
one
to
the
other
his
eyes
straining
through
the
gloom
maman
he
whispered
the
woman
voice
came
trailing
softly
to
them
they
want
maman
the
girl
threw
her
arm
protectingly
over
the
woman
shoulders
jean
is
here
see
petite
maman
it
is
jean
your
jean
the
woman
repeated
the
words
in
that
gentle
plaintive
singsong
they
want
and
then
she
got
to
her
feet
jean
her
voice
rose
shrilly
crescendo
it
was
that
my
jean
maman
the
boy
came
and
stood
beside
her
you
would
not
have
me
stay
behind
when
they
need
me
you
will
be
glad
to
have
me
go
come
maman
you
must
say
that
you
are
glad

little
one

maman
that
you
are
glad
so
young
jean
but
old
enough
to
fight
when
they
need
me
old
enough
to
fight
for
france
my
baby
you
will
not
grieve
maman
she
reached
up
and
caught
his
face
between
her
two
hands
and
drew
it
down
and
kissed
him
on
the
mouth
ah
jean
and
say
how
do
i
look
he
turned
around
and
around
in
front
of
them
but
angele
fetch
the
lamp
quickly
you
can
not
see
in
this
dark
you
can
not
see
me
the
girl
laughed
a
bit
uncertainly
and
then
she
went
quickly
rushing
into
the
next
room
the
woman
gripped
hold
of
the
boy
hand
his
fingers
grasped
hers
petite
maman
mon
jean
just
a
moment
still
so
they
stood
there
silent
and
very
close
to
each
other
in
the
room
crowded
with
moving
splotching
shadows
the
girl
came
back
through
the
curtain
a
lighted
lamp
between
her
two
hands
the
flicker
of
it
spread
broadly
into
her
eager
anxious
face
the
glow
of
it
trickled
before
her
and
widened
through
the
room
the
shadows
stuck
to
the
walls
in
the
corners
and
rocked
up
against
the
ceiling
black
among
the
uneven
streaks
of
yellow
light
now
angele
now
maman
put
it
there
on
the
table
angele
no
hold
it
higher
like
that
keep
your
hands
steady

or
how
can
maman

a
miserable
lamp

uniform

magnificent
i
am
the
real
poilu
hein
something
to
be
proud
of
maman
the
real
poilu
the
girl
questioned
softly
the
grandchild
of
the
real
poilu
maybe
she
mocks
me
maman
be
quiet
angele
i
do
not
mock
maman
but
i
will
not
have
his
head
turned
the
poor
little
cabbage
see
maman
she
will
not
stop
tell
her
that
i
fight
for
france
for
a
moment
the
woman
hesitated
they
could
hear
the
deep
breath
she
took
for
france
and
for
something
else
my
little
son
with
great
care
the
girl
placed
the
lamp
on
the
table
something
else
maman
the
thing
for
which
france
stands
and
conquers
he
seized
at
her
last
word
conquers
of
course
she
conquers
and
i
will
help
i
will
kill
the
boches
right
and
left
i
shall
fight
until
france
will
win
a
strange
light
had
filtered
into
the
woman
heavily
lidded
eyes
bravo
the
girl
clapped
her
hands
together
and
shall
we
have
our
supper
now
petite
maman
and
my
little
rabbit
maman
when
i
have

uniform

a
moment

cauliflower
maman

if
i
do
not
try
to
be
pleasant
i
shall
weep
you
would
not
have
me
weep
brother
jean
i
would
wet
the
pretty
shoulder
of
your
uniform
with
my
tears
that
would
be
a
tragedy
so
come
along
to
supper
my
rascal
hand
in
hand
the
boy
and
the
girl
went
through
the
plush
curtain
into
the
kitchen
the
woman
stood
rigid
beside
the
table
help
me
she
whispered
beneath
her
breath
you
she
stumbled
to
her
knees
her
head
was
pressed
against
the
edge
of
the
table
her
hands
fumbled
over
the
top
of
it
the
fingers
widespread
and
catching
clutching
at
whatever
they
touched
from
the
kitchen
came
the
sound
of
low
voices
a
knife
rattled
clatteringly
against
a
plate
once
the
girl
laughed
and
her
laughter
snapped
off
in
a
sob
the
woman
moaned
a
little
just
to
watch
over
him
that
all
i
you
across
there
just
to
protect
him
her
hands
went
to
her
throat
the
fingers
tightening
a
sign
she
implored
dieu
that
you
hear
me
her
eyes
stared
about
the
room
peering
frantically
from
under
their
heavy
lids
will
you
not
help
me
she
pleaded
dieu
mon
dieu
will
you
not
help
me
her
kneeling
figure
swayed
a
bit
you
will
not
hear
she
whimpered
you
will
not
hear
for
a
moment
longer
she
waited
in
the
tense
silence
and
then
she
rose
stiffly
to
her
feet
her
eyes
riveted
themselves
upon
a
little
pool
of
yellow
light
that
lay
in
the
center
of
the
table
under
the
lamp
the
palms
of
her
hands
struck
noiselessly
together
very
slowly
she
went
through
the
curtain
and
into
the
kitchen
it
was
a
scrupulously
clean
room
a
stove
stood
in
one
corner
against
the
wall
hung
a
row
of
pots
and
pans
that
caught
the
light
from
the
swinging
lamp
in
brilliant
burnished
patches
angele
and
jean
sat
near
to
each
other
at
the
center
table
their
heads
were
close
their
cautious
whispering
stopped
abruptly
as
she
came
toward
them
the
woman
sat
down
with
the
girl
on
one
side
of
her
and
the
boy
on
the
other
she
was
very
silent
there
was
only
one
thing
she
could
have
said
she
did
not
want
to
say
it
mechanically
she
tried
to
eat
she
watched
her
hands
moving
upward
from
her
plate
with
a
sort
of
dazed
interest
it
was
only
when
she
tried
to
swallow
that
she
realized
how
each
mouthful
of
food
choked
her
the
one
question
came
to
her
lips
again
and
again
at
last
she
asked
it
when
do
you
go
mon
jean
the
boy
gave
a
quick
glance
at
his
sister
and
his
eyes
fixed
themselves
upon
the
table
before
him
and
stayed
there
she
knew
then
what
they
had
been
speaking
of
when
she
came
into
the
room
what
difference
does
it
make
petite
maman
when
i
go
but
when
my
son
see
angele
she
is
anxious
to
be
rid
of
me
she
can
not
wait
until
i
go
she
insists
upon
knowing
even
before
we
have
finished
this
supper
of
ours
maman
the
girl
spoke
hurriedly
let
us
talk
of
that
later
when
she
insisted
but
maman
you
have
not
touched
your
food
was
it
not
good
and
i
thought
you
would
so
like
the
marmite
it
is
excellent
angele
then
eat
maman
it
is
that
i
am
not
hungry
angele
so
the
marmite
is
not
good
petite
maman
if
it
were
excellent
even
though
you
have
no
hunger
you
would
eat
and
eat
until
there
was
not
one
little
bit
left
the
woman
took
another
spoonful
when
she
repeated
the
boy
dark
eyes
lifted
and
looked
into
hers
maman
her
figure
straightened
itself
with
a
quick
jerk
and
what
does
it
matter
petite
maman
when
i
go
surely
is
as
nice
a
time
as
any
as
nice
a
time
as
any
she
echoed
his
words
the
three
of
them
sat
there
silently
the
girl
was
the
first
to
move
ah
but
it
is
hot
in
here
she
pushed
her
chair
back
from
the
table
it
is
uncomfortable
the
boy
and
the
woman
got
to
their
feet
i
pack
maman
not
much
you
know
just
my
shaving
things
and
soap
and
some
underwear
angele
will
help
me
i
wo
be
long
he
went
out
of
the
kitchen
door
and
down
the
narrow
passage
way
to
his
room
the
girl
hesitated
for
a
moment
without
a
word
she
hurried
after
him
the
woman
crossed
slowly
into
the
next
room
for
a
second
she
stood
beside
the
table
and
then
she
walked
over
to
the
window
outside
the
street
was
dark
no
light
trickled
through
the
blinds
of
the
house
opposite
no
light
reached
its
brilliant
electric
flare
into
the
sky
no
light
from
the
tall
specked
through
the
gloom
in
the
dim
shadow
of
the
silent
street
she
could
see
the
vague
forms
of
people
going
to
and
fro
blurred
figures
moving
in
the
darkness
with
the
echo
of
their
footsteps
trailing
sharply
behind
them
she
stood
quite
still
once
her
hands
crept
up
to
her
mouth
the
backs
of
them
pressing
against
her
teeth
maman
she
wheeled
about
at
the
sound
of
jean
voice
he
was
standing
just
within
the
doorway
the
girl
at
his
side
the
woman
stood
there
staring
the
girl
crossed
the
room
quickly
and
put
her
arm
about
the
woman
waist
drawing
her
close
petite
maman
you
go
now
jean
she
said
the
words
carefully
and
precisely
with
a
tremendous
effort
for
control
but
yes
maman
she
leaned
a
little
against
the
girl
mon
jean
you
will
have
courage
great
courage
my
little
one
you
will
be
protected
you
will
be
protected
she
had
said
that
in
spite
of
herself
he
came
to
her
then
and
flung
his
arms
about
her
and
kissed
her
on
either
cheek
and
held
her
tightly
to
him
petite
maman
good
she
could
not
say
it
angele
my
little
rabbit
i
wish
you
luck
my
cabbage
au
revoir
and
her
lips
brushed
across
his
mouth
for
a
second
he
did
not
move
then
he
went
across
the
room
and
out
through
the
door
he
was
gone
the
woman
eyes
went
to
the
window
the
silent
darkened
street
the
people
there
below
her
the
somber
black
lack
of
light
maman
the
girl
whispered
they
will
watch
over
him
the
woman
muttered
they
must
watch
out
there
they
do
come
back
into
the
world
again
to
protect
they
can
not
can
not
leave
them
in
all
that
horror
alone
see
maman
the
girl
quivering
face
was
against
the
maman
jean
waves
to
you
her
eyes
followed
the
pointing
of
the
girl
finger
they
must
be
here
she
murmured
maman
wave
to
jean
her
gaze
rested
on
the
dim
undefined
figure
of
the
boy
standing
in
the
street
with
his
hat
in
the
hand
that
was
reached
toward
them
above
his
head
mechanically
she
waved
back
the
woman
and
the
girl
stood
close
oh
petite
maman
she
whispered
piteously
the
woman
eyes
dilated
there
following
after
jean
going
through
the
street
moving
unheeded
among
the
vague
figures
of
the
people
going
to
and
fro
something
was
there
some
scant
movement
like
a
current
too
quiet
to
see
a
shadow
in
the
shadows
that
her
sight
could
not
hold
to
in
the
dark
street
staying
close
to
her
jean
she
could
feel
something
some
one
was
there
her
eyes
strained
with
desperate
intentness
her
hands
went
up
slowly
across
her
heart
the
words
that
came
to
her
lips
were
whispered
dieu
give
me
faith
faith
not
to
disbelieve
yellow
he
walked
along
the
pavement
with
the
long
swinging
stride
he
had
so
successfully
aped
from
the
men
about
him
it
had
been
one
of
the
first
things
upon
which
he
had
dwelt
with
the
greatest
patience
one
of
the
first
upon
which
he
had
centered
his
stolid
concentration
he
had
carried
his
persistency
to
such
a
degree
that
he
had
even
been
known
to
follow
other
men
about
measuring
their
step
to
a
nicety
with
those
long
narrow
eyes
of
his
that
seemed
to
see
nothing
and
yet
penetrated
into
the
very
soul
of
everything
his
classmates
at
the
big
college
had
at
the
beginning
laughed
at
him
scoffing
readily
because
of
the
dogged
manner
in
which
he
had
persevered
at
his
desire
to
become
thoroughly
american
now
after
all
his
laborious
painstaking
now
that
he
had
carefully
studied
all
their
ways
of
talking
all
their
distinctive
mannerisms
now
that
he
had
gone
even
beyond
that
with
true
oriental
perception
reaching
out
with
the
cunning
tentacles
of
his
brain
into
the
minds
of
those
about
him
he
knew
they
had
begun
to
treat
him
with
the
comradeship
the
unthinking
which
they
accorded
each
other
he
thoroughly
realized
that
had
they
paused
to
consider
had
they
in
any
way
been
made
to
feel
that
he
a
chinaman
had
consciously
made
up
his
mind
to
become
one
of
them
consistently
mimicking
them
day
after
day
that
they
would
have
resented
him
he
knew
that
they
could
not
have
helped
but
think
it
all
hypocrisy
and
yet
he
actually
felt
that
it
was
the
one
big
thing
of
his
life
that
desire
of
his
to
cast
aside
the
benightment
of
dying
china
for
what
he
considered
the
enlightment
and
virility
of
america
to
be
sure
he
recognized
there
was
still
a
great
number
of
the
men
who
distrusted
him
because
of
his
yellow
face
he
had
made
up
his
mind
with
the
slow
deliberation
that
always
characterized
his
unswerving
determination
to
win
every
one
of
them
before
the
end
of
his
last
year
he
would
show
them
one
and
all
that
he
was
as
good
as
they
were
that
the
traditions
of
the
chinaman
which
they
so
looked
down
upon
upon
which
he
himself
looked
down
upon
were
not
his
traditions
as
he
walked
along
he
thought
of
these
things
thought
of
them
carefully
and
concisely
in
english
his
narrow
eyes
became
a
trifle
more
narrow
and
a
smile
that
held
something
of
triumph
in
it
came
and
played
about
his
flat
mobile
mouth
it
had
been
raining
hard
the
wet
streets
stretched
in
dark
reflecting
coils
under
the
corner
lamps
overhead
a
black
sky
lowered
threateningly
pressing
down
upon
the
crouching
gray
masses
of
the
houses
in
sullen
menace
now
and
again
a
swift
moving
train
flung
itself
in
thundering
derision
across
the
elevated
tracks
a
long
brightly
lit
line
streaking
through
the
encircling
gloom
he
could
feel
the
mysterious
throb
of
life
all
about
him
the
unfathomed
lure
of
the
night
of
the
few
people
that
at
so
late
an
hour
crept
past
him
looming
for
a
second
in
sudden
distinctness
at
his
side
then
fading
into
the
deep
engulfing
shadows
of
the
dim
street
he
was
at
a
complete
loss
how
to
express
to
himself
the
feeling
of
dread
a
subtle
feeling
that
somehow
refused
to
be
translated
into
the
carefully
acquired
english
of
which
he
was
so
proud
for
a
moment
he
doubted
himself
doubted
that
were
he
so
thoroughly
american
he
could
feel
the
oriental
subconscious
recognition
of
the
purposeful
sinister
intent
in
the
huddled
mass
of
darkened
shop
windows
with
their
signs
in
the
shining
reptile
scales
of
the
asphalt
underfoot
in
the
pulsing
intensity
of
the
hot
torpid
july
atmosphere
a
street
lamp
flickered
its
uncertain
light
sluggishly
over
the
carefully
groomed
figure
and
across
the
placid
breath
of
the
yellow
face
he
paused
a
second
as
he
saw
a
form
come
lurching
unsteadily
out
of
the
gloom
ahead
of
him
it
came
nearer
and
he
could
see
that
what
had
at
first
appeared
to
be
a
dark
undefinable
mass
pushed
here
and
there
by
unseen
hands
was
in
reality
a
man
swaying
drunkenly
out
of
the
shadows
he
watched
the
man
curiously
with
a
little
of
that
contemptuous
feeling
an
oriental
always
holds
for
any
expression
of
excess
as
the
man
stood
before
him
in
the
darkness
as
he
stumbled
and
seemed
about
to
fall
he
put
out
his
hand
and
caught
him
by
the
elbow
thank
the
drunken
eyes
blinked
blearily
up
into
his
stolid
impassive
face
it
fine
to
be
saved
on
a
stormy
night
like
this
it
is
do
mention
it
it
a
powerful
dark
night
it
is
les
that
is
so
and
it
a
damn
long
way
home
ai
it
i
do
not
know
by
the
saints
and
no
more
do
i
ai
you
got
a
dime
on
you
mister
you
could
be
giving
it
to
me
for
car
fare
could
you
now
mister
velee
glad
to
let
you
have
it
he
fished
in
his
pocket
he
drew
out
the
coin
and
placed
it
in
the
outstretched
hand
he
watched
the
dirty
fingers
close
eagerly
over
it
suddenly
the
bloodshot
eyes
wavered
suspiciously
across
his
face
he
saw
the
red
flushed
features
twitch
convulsively
holy
mother
the
drunkard
muttered
thickly
it
a
heathen
the
dime
slipped
from
between
the
inert
fingers
it
tinkled
down
onto
the
pavement
rolling
with
a
little
splash
into
a
pool
of
water
that
lay
a
deep
stain
in
the
crevice
of
the
broken
asphalt
for
a
moment
he
wondered
placidly
at
the
injustice
of
it
wondered
that
he
should
be
made
to
feel
the
disgust
of
so
revolting
a
thing
as
this
drunkard
he
saw
that
the
man
had
crossed
himself
with
sudden
fervor
he
saw
him
shuffle
uncertainly
this
way
and
that
as
though
the
feet
refused
to
carry
the
huge
bloated
body
he
stood
watching
the
reeling
figure
until
its
dark
outline
was
absorbed
into
the
intenser
darkness
of
a
side
street
the
expression
on
his
face
never
changing
he
walked
on
he
knew
he
had
no
right
to
be
out
at
that
time
of
the
night
he
knew
he
ought
to
be
sitting
at
his
desk
in
his
comfortable
little
room
working
out
the
studies
which
he
had
set
himself
and
yet
he
could
not
make
up
his
mind
to
turn
back
something
drew
him
on
into
the
blackness
of
the
night
pulling
him
into
it
like
a
fated
thing
now
and
then
he
found
that
the
stride
he
had
acquired
from
such
grinding
observation
tired
him
not
for
worlds
would
he
have
shortened
his
step
to
that
padding
sinuous
motion
so
distinctly
chinese
he
had
grown
to
hate
all
things
chinese
in
the
short
time
in
which
he
had
been
in
new
york
he
had
discarded
with
the
utmost
patience
the
traits
which
are
so
persistently
associated
with
the
chinaman
to
be
thought
american
to
have
the
freedom
the
quick
appreciation
of
life
that
belongs
to
the
occident
that
had
been
the
goal
toward
which
he
had
striven
the
goal
he
prided
himself
he
had
almost
reached
suddenly
he
became
aware
of
a
hand
on
his
arm
in
the
dark
he
felt
the
pressure
of
bony
fingers
against
his
flesh
looking
down
he
saw
that
a
woman
had
crept
up
from
behind
him
that
she
had
put
out
her
hand
in
an
effort
to
detain
him
it
was
in
the
center
of
a
block
the
thick
blackness
that
hung
loosely
an
opaque
veil
all
about
him
was
almost
impenetrable
yet
as
he
looked
at
her
with
his
small
piercing
eyes
he
thought
he
saw
her
lips
moving
in
crimsoned
stains
splashed
against
the
whiteness
of
her
face
what
is
it
he
asked
he
saw
her
raise
her
eyelids
at
his
question
he
found
himself
gazing
into
her
eyes
eyes
that
were
twin
balls
of
fire
left
to
burn
in
a
place
that
had
been
devastated
by
flames
it
hot
ai
it
he
stood
silent
for
a
moment
trying
to
realize
that
the
woman
had
every
right
to
be
there
trying
to
understand
with
an
even
greater
endeavor
that
she
was
in
reality
a
flesh
and
blood
woman
and
not
some
mysteriously
incarnate
soul
crawling
to
his
side
out
of
the
sinister
night
les
it
velee
hot
something
in
his
tone
caused
her
to
start
caused
her
to
look
around
her
as
though
she
were
afraid
i
would
have
spoke
she
stammered
i
would
have
spoke
only
such
a
fierce
night
then
as
he
did
not
answer
her
immediately
her
voice
rose
querulously
it
a
fierce
night
ai
it
now
that
was
the
word
for
which
he
had
so
vainly
searched
throughout
the
vocabulary
of
his
carefully
acquired
english
the
word
the
woman
had
given
him
that
expressed
the
sullen
menace
of
the
night
about
him
it
is
fie
he
made
an
effort
to
accomplish
the
refractory
it
is
fierce
the
hand
she
had
withdrawn
from
his
arm
was
reached
out
again
he
could
feel
her
fingers
scrape
like
the
talons
of
a
frightened
bird
around
his
wrist
you
get
it
too
mister
get
what
the
kind
of
feeling
that
makes
you
think
something
is
going
to
happen
she
drew
the
back
of
her
free
hand
across
her
mouth
ai
it
making
you
afraid
somehow
the
woman
words
aroused
within
him
a
dread
that
was
a
prophecy
he
made
one
attempt
at
holding
to
his
acquired
americanism
the
americanism
which
was
slowly
receding
before
the
stifled
waves
of
oriental
foreboding
like
a
weak
protesting
thing
that
fears
a
hidden
strength
for
he
knew
the
foreboding
was
fate
and
he
knew
too
that
when
fulfilled
it
would
be
met
with
all
the
stoicism
of
a
chinaman
you
feel
aflaid
the
fingers
about
his
wrist
clattered
bonily
together
then
clinched
themselves
anew
yes
she
whispered
i
guess
that
it
i
guess
i
afraid
for
a
moment
he
thought
of
the
lateness
of
the
hour
i
velee
solee
he
said
i
solee
but
i
must
be
going
you
ca
leave
me
she
stuttered
behind
her
shut
teeth
you
got
the
heart
to
leave
me
all
alone
on
a
night
like
this
you
can
go
to
your
home
and
he
thought
of
the
drunkard
who
had
gone
to
his
home
surely
the
night
sheltered
strange
creatures
les
you
better
go
on
to
your
home
she
laughed
he
had
never
thought
of
one
of
his
little
chinese
gods
with
their
crooked
faces
laughing
but
as
he
heard
her
he
knew
that
their
mirth
would
sound
like
that
sound
as
though
all
the
gladness
had
been
killed
choked
out
of
it
leaving
only
the
harsh
echoes
that
mocked
and
mocked
gee
mister
i
ai
got
no
place
to
go
i
velee
solee
he
said
it
again
not
knowing
what
else
to
say
something
in
his
evident
sincerity
aroused
her
to
protest
oh
i
know
you
thinks
it
queer
for
me
to
be
talking
this
way
she
said
i
know
you
thinks
it
funny
for
me
to
say
i
afraid
and
i
ai
excepting
she
added
hastily
on
a
night
like
this
it
kinder
makes
everything
alive
everything
that
rotten
bad
i
ai
ashamed
of
the
things
i
done
i
ai
scared
of
the
dead
things
it
the
live
ones
i
afraid
of
the
dirty
live
things
they
kinder
come
at
you
in
the
dark
for
an
instant
her
body
trembled
against
his
then
they
goes
past
you
all
creeping
on
their
bellies
sliding
like
like
slime
you
do
know
what
you
are
saying
he
interrupted
i
know
she
insisted
i
know
some
night
like
this
i
be
doing
something
awful
and
they
be
there
she
pointed
a
shaking
hand
towards
the
shadows
they
be
there
wriggling
to
me
quiet
imagination
he
said
and
he
smiled
in
the
dark
she
could
not
have
seen
the
smile
nor
could
she
have
known
that
the
lightness
of
his
tone
covered
a
deep
malignant
dread
it
is
all
imagination
it
ai
she
spoke
sullenly
i
tell
you
it
real
it
horrible
real
her
voice
was
frantic
maybe
it
is
he
conceded
and
then
as
she
made
no
answer
he
asked
you
like
to
walk
with
me
a
little
yes
her
head
drooped
as
though
she
were
utterly
discouraged
it
would
be
so
bad
as
sticking
it
out
here
alone
he
could
not
help
but
notice
that
she
hesitated
a
bit
before
the
word
alone
undoubtedly
she
could
not
get
the
thought
of
those
things
those
live
things
she
so
feared
out
of
her
head
the
things
that
waited
for
her
in
the
shadows
they
walked
along
the
wet
pavements
together
an
engine
shrieked
weirdly
above
them
like
something
neither
bird
nor
beast
like
something
inhuman
under
a
street
lamp
she
glanced
up
at
him
curiously
he
heard
her
gasp
he
looked
down
at
her
he
saw
her
eyes
widen
in
terror
he
saw
her
pale
bare
hands
creep
uncertain
stumbling
to
her
neck
as
if
she
were
choking
he
heard
her
voice
rattling
in
her
throat
what
is
it
he
asked
you
are
ill
he
put
his
hand
on
her
shoulder
he
could
feel
her
shudder
as
she
writhed
and
twisted
under
his
touch
let
go
of
me
her
voice
was
hoarse
let
go
of
me
i
say
for
some
unaccountable
reason
his
fingers
closed
all
the
more
tightly
on
her
shrinking
flesh
let
me
go
you
damned
chink
she
muttered
the
words
under
her
breath
he
heard
her
he
thought
of
the
drunkard
and
he
thought
of
her
suddenly
he
felt
quite
furious
stilly
sinisterly
furious
i
he
said
it
stolidly
his
narrow
black
eyes
were
unwavering
on
her
she
began
to
cry
let
me
go
she
whimpered
i
ai
done
nothing
to
you
i
have
got
on
to
your
being
a
chink
what
diffelence
does
that
make
he
asked
and
then
he
reiterated
with
careful
precision
i
tell
you
i
a
her
words
came
to
him
in
a
gurgle
of
terror
i
hate
you
i
hate
all
of
your
yellow
faces
and
them
eyes
i
hate
them
horrid
nasty
eyes
he
bent
his
head
until
his
face
almost
touched
hers
his
strong
angry
fingers
held
her
firmly
by
either
arm
it
is
not
pletty
this
face
she
struggled
inane
with
fear
she
fought
trying
to
free
herself
to
tear
away
from
the
grip
of
those
awful
hands
swaying
like
a
tortured
trapped
creature
against
his
strength
she
could
feel
the
intensity
the
calm
scrutiny
of
his
long
narrow
eyes
upon
her
suddenly
something
in
his
brain
snapped
he
pushed
her
roughly
from
him
he
saw
her
fall
to
the
pavement
he
saw
her
head
strike
the
curb
he
stood
there
watching
her
as
she
lay
outlined
by
the
light
colored
material
of
her
dress
against
the
wet
blackness
of
the
asphalt
what
diffelence
does
it
make
if
i
am
a
chinaman
he
asked
it
as
he
bent
over
her
but
she
did
not
answer
the
question
went
out
into
the
heavy
stillness
hanging
there
to
be
echoed
deafeningly
by
a
thousand
silent
tongues
something
in
the
sudden
quiet
of
the
way
she
lay
filled
him
with
a
tranquil
joy
he
knelt
beside
her
he
reached
his
hand
over
her
heart
he
got
up
slowly
deliberately
he
moved
silently
away
going
with
that
padded
sinuous
motion
so
distinctly
chinese
with
cunning
stealth
he
went
back
the
way
he
had
come
treading
lightly
cautiously
seeking
the
darkest
shadows
he
had
gone
some
little
distance
when
he
heard
the
regular
beat
of
hurrying
footsteps
following
him
he
stood
stolidly
still
awaiting
whatever
might
happen
overhead
he
saw
a
cluster
of
heavy
black
clouds
sweeping
across
the
sky
like
eager
reaching
hands
against
a
somber
background
it
had
begun
to
rain
again
he
could
feel
the
raindrops
trickling
gently
down
his
upturned
face
he
wondered
as
the
footsteps
halted
beside
him
if
he
should
have
run
his
mind
working
rapidly
decided
that
any
other
man
would
have
gotten
away
any
other
man
but
not
a
chinaman
a
heavy
hand
fell
across
his
shoulder
i
got
you
my
boy
a
voice
shouted
in
his
ear
i
seen
you
kneeling
there
beside
her
you
be
coming
along
with
me
he
turned
to
face
the
voice
the
wind
that
heralded
the
coming
storm
rustled
through
the
street
carrying
with
it
a
litter
of
filthy
castaway
newspapers
flurries
of
stinging
dust
swirled
above
the
pavement
a
low
rumble
of
thunder
bellowed
overhead
then
the
rain
came
down
in
sudden
lashing
fury
he
had
to
raise
his
voice
to
make
himself
heard
i
velee
glad
he
said
the
bull
eye
was
flashed
into
his
placid
narrow
eyes
he
could
see
the
policeman
face
behind
the
light
see
the
surprise
quivering
on
the
red
features
in
the
darkness
above
the
racket
of
the
storm
he
heard
the
gasping
mutter
yellow
by
god
yellow
footnote
published
originally
in
all
story
the
racket
was
terrific
the
yelping
the
shrill
prolonged
whines
the
quick
incessant
barking
and
running
in
growling
the
throaty
infuriated
snarling
the
woman
stood
at
the
window
gazing
out
into
the
gathering
twilight
before
her
eyes
stretched
the
drab
flat
fields
here
and
there
a
shadowy
mass
of
trees
reached
their
feathery
tips
that
were
etched
in
darkly
against
the
graying
skies
directly
before
her
beyond
the
unkept
waste
that
might
at
one
time
have
been
a
garden
reared
the
high
wire
walls
of
the
kennels
she
could
just
make
out
the
dim
undefined
forms
of
the
dogs
running
to
and
fro
within
the
narrow
confining
space
the
swift
persistent
movement
of
them
fascinated
her
the
ghostly
shapes
of
them
pattering
sinuously
and
silently
along
the
ground
the
dull
scratching
thud
of
the
claws
and
bodies
that
hurled
themselves
again
and
again
into
the
strong
wire
netting
the
impossibility
of
their
escape
throttled
her
their
futile
attempts
at
freedom
caused
a
powerful
nausea
to
creep
over
her
and
there
in
the
center
of
the
run
she
could
distinguish
chained
to
the
a
pale
blur
in
the
fading
light
the
motionless
yellow
mass
of
the
chow
the
shrill
prolonged
whines
the
quick
incessant
barking
oh
my
gawd
she
muttered
involuntarily
oh
my
gawd
the
man
sitting
in
the
middle
of
the
room
pulled
his
pipe
out
of
his
mouth
what
that
you
say
she
stood
at
the
window
her
eyes
fixed
steadfastly
on
that
one
dumb
dog
among
all
those
yelping
snarling
other
dogs
the
man
got
up
from
his
chair
and
came
and
stood
beside
her
unconsciously
she
shrank
away
from
his
nearness
ai
you
used
to
that
by
now
ai
you
she
turned
toward
him
all
but
her
eyes
her
eyes
were
still
riveted
out
there
upon
the
motionless
chow
chained
in
the
center
of
the
run
it
ai
the
noise
that
that
do
mean
so
much
james
it
ai
the
noise
then
what
the
matter
huh
she
pointed
a
trembling
forefinger
at
that
yellow
mass
tied
to
the
him
she
whispered
he
do
make
no
racket
james
the
man
peered
over
her
shoulder
the
chow
yes
her
voice
was
still
he
do
make
no
racket
james
i
like
to
hear
him
the
man
blustered
i
just
like
to
hear
one
peep
out
of
him
that
all
she
saw
his
coarse
hairy
hand
go
to
his
hip
pocket
she
smiled
bitterly
she
knew
the
confidence
he
felt
when
he
touched
the
handle
of
his
pistol
you
do
need
that
on
him
she
said
he
just
sits
there
and
never
move
he
do
hardly
eat
when
you
feeds
him
he
do
seem
to
have
no
heart
left
for
nothing
he
ai
like
the
terrier
what
had
the
distemper
he
ai
like
the
greyhound
what
had
the
hydrophobia
so
awful
bad
what
mean
the
man
muttered
angrily
ai
they
had
the
hydrophobia

had
the
distemper

they

says

did
james
ai
i

menace

community

and

from
me

dog
when

gets
took
that
there
way
why
i
heard
tell
of
dogs
what
have
torn
men
limb
from
limb
and
then
he
added
in
afterthought
men
that
been
kind
to
too
her
laughter
rang
out
shrilly
piercingly
aw
james
she
giggled
hysterically
aw
now
james
what
that
his
hand
was
on
her
hand
see
here
you
ai
i
kind
to
his
touch
sobered
her
quite
suddenly
kind
to
she
repeated
his
words
vaguely
as
though
not
fully
conscious
of
their
actual
meaning
the
grip
of
his
fingers
tightened
cruelly
about
her
arm
ai
i
kind
to
oh
my
gawd
she
whimpered
oh
my
gawd
yes
he
went
back
to
the
center
of
the
room
and
lighted
the
lamp
on
the
table
its
light
flickered
in
a
sickly
yellow
glow
over
the
chairs
across
the
unpapered
walls
and
dribbled
feebly
upwards
to
where
the
heavy
rafters
of
the
ceiling
were
obliterated
in
a
smothering
thickness
of
shadows
what
you
standing
there
for
pull
down
that
blind
come
here
i
say
the
faint
motionless
form
there
beside
the
the
wooden
stiffened
attitude
of
it
the
great
mass
of
the
chow
rigid
body
that
was
gradually
becoming
absorbed
into
the
gray
shadow
that
was
slowly
losing
its
faint
outline
in
the
saturating
blurring
darkness
she
did
as
she
was
told
hastily
nervously
and
then
she
came
and
stood
beside
the
table
try
as
she
would
to
prevent
it
her
eyes
kept
on
staring
through
the
curtained
window
again
she
became
conscious
of
the
yelping
the
prolonged
whines
the
quick
incessant
barking
and
running
in
growling
the
throaty
infuriated
snarling
i
ca
stand
it
no
more
she
shrieked
it
too
much
so
it
is
i
just
ca
stand
it
no
more
he
looked
up
at
her
startled
what
under
the
canopy
eating
you
she
sank
into
a
chair
the
palms
of
her
hands
pounded
against
each
other
in
the
lamplight
her
face
showed
itself
pale
and
drawn
with
the
eyes
pulling
out
of
its
deadened
setness
in
live
despair
you
got
to
do
something
for
me
james
her
voice
shook
you
simply

rose
to

feet

when

tone

quite
controlled

man

erect
what

to
let

to
let

get
away

got
to
make
that
free
he
laughed
the
laugh
had
no
sound
of
mirth
in
it
the
laugh
was
long
and
loud
but
its
loudness
could
not
cover
the
insidious
evil
of
it
that
a
good
one
he
shouted
let
a
dog
go
of
his
own
sweet
will
when
some
day
i
be
getting
my
price
for
him
that
the
funniest
thing
i
heard
in
many
a
long
day
land

full
of
wit

she
retorted
sullenly
but
he
paid
no
attention
to
her
i
never
would
have
thought
it
that
a
cinch
say
it
do
seem
learning
all
the
time
her
teeth
came
together
with
a
sharp
snap
better
be
careful
you
do
learn
too
much
about
me
she
whispered
it
beneath
her
breath
muttering
huh
he
leaned
toward
her
over
the
table
i
do
like
no
muttering
i
ai
the
one
to
allow
no
muttering
around
me
speak
out
if
you
got
something
to
say
and
if
you
ai
why
then
shut
up
the
lamp
threw
its
full
light
up
into
his
face
not
one
muscle
not
one
wrinkle
but
stood
out
harshly
above
its
crude
flame
she
drew
back
a
step
all
right
she
had
been
goaded
into
it
i
speak
up
all
right

not
till

brought
what
that
mut
got
to
do
between
you
and
me
his
eyes
refused
to
meet
her
eyes
that
were
ablaze
with
a
strange
inspired
light
everything
from
the
day
i
seen
you
bring
him
here
from
the
day
i
seen
you
beating
him
because

at

day

and
when
you
was
drunk

way

his
hands
clenched
at

sides

knuckles

white
against
the
soiled
dark
skin

interrupted
him

he
watched
her
for
a
second
between
lids
a
cunning
smile
spread
itself
over
his
thick
lips
he
walked
to
the
door
and
threw
it
wide
open
you
can
go
if
you
likes
you
can
go
now
her
hand
went
to
her
heart
the
scant
color
in
her
face
left
it
she
took
one
hesitating
step
forward
and
then
she
stood
quite
still
if
you
lets
the
dog
go
i
stays
her
words
sounded
muffled
he
shrugged
his
shoulders
the
dog
my
dog
i
ai
able
to
see
where
he
comes
in
on
all
this
you
ca
see
nothing
you
do
want
to
see
it
knowing
too
well
what
that
pup
up
against
that
makes
me
want
you
to
let
him
go
that
i
do
want
to
have
the
heart
took
out
of
him
the
way
you
took
the
heart
out
of
me
that
makes
me
want
to
have
him
set
free
he
gave
a
noiseless
chuckle
so
i
took
the
heart
out
of
you
did
i
she
glared
at
him
savagely
you
knows
you
did
for
a
moment
they
were
silent
well
he
asked
she
saw
him
wave
a
hand
toward
the
door
aw
james
you
ca
be
so
cruel
bad
you
ca
the
other
dogs
mind
it
they
makes
a
noise
and
they
tears
around
and
then
they
eats
and
drinks
and
late
at
nights
they
lies
down
and
sleeps
if
there
no
moon
but
that
he
ai
like
them
maybe
he
is
savage
maybe
you
right
to
be
afraid
of
him
his
whole
figure
was
suddenly
taut
his
head
shrank
into
his
shoulders
there
ai
nothing
i
afraid
of
get
that
into
your
head
i
afraid
of
nothing
and
if
you
wants
to
go
why
all
i
got
to
say
is
you
can
git
a
stillness
came
between
them
broken
only
by
the
sounds
from
the
kennels
the
yelping
the
shrill
prolonged
whines
the
quick
incessant
barking
and
running
in
growling
the
throaty
infuriated
snarling
he
went
to
the
table
and
took
the
lamp
up
in
one
hand
he
went
over
to
the
door
and
closed
it
with
a
loud
bang
then
he
started
toward
the
stairs
if
you
ai
able
to
bring
yourself
to
leave
me
the
words
came
to
her
over
his
shoulder
you
can
come
on
up
to
bed
mechanically
she
followed
him
up
the
steps
mechanically
she
went
through
the
process
of
undressing
and
washing
long
after
he
had
fallen
asleep
she
lay
there
wide
awake
watching
the
moonlight
trickle
in
quivering
golden
spots
across
the
floor
lay
wide
awake
listening
to
the
eerie
baying
of
the
dogs
she
had
had
her
chance
of
freedom
and
at
the
last
moment
her
courage
had
failed
her
what
she
had
told
him
had
been
the
absolute
truth
she
had
never
realized
what
had
happened
to
her
what
a
stifled
smothered
thing
she
had
become
until
that
day
when
he
had
brought
the
home
to
the
kennels
she
had
married
james
when
she
was
very
young
their
fathers
farms
adjoined
it
had
been
the
expected
thing
and
she
had
gone
through
with
it
quite
as
a
matter
of
course
in
those
days
he
had
been
somewhat
ambitious
the
around
admitted
grudgingly
that
james
conover
was
a
born
farmer
then
the
old
people
both
their
fathers
and
his
mother
had
grown
a
bit
older
and
one
by
one
they
had
died
there
had
been
nothing
violent
in
their
deaths
silent
like
most
country
persons
they
had
grown
a
trifle
more
silent
a
trifle
more
bigoted
and
then
they
were
dead
it
had
seemed
to
her
that
way
at
any
rate
she
had
become
conscious
all
of
a
sudden
that
she
was
alone
with
james
strange
that
the
consciousness
should
have
come
to
her
after
she
had
been
alone
with
him
for
three
years
and
then
that
she
should
only
realize
she
was
alone
in
the
world
with
him
the
first
time
he
came
home
drunk
after
that
he
took
to
drinking
more
and
more
and
finally
he
gave
up
farming
it
had
been
quite
by
accident
that
he
took
to
boarding
dogs
now
and
then
buying
one
for
a
quick
turn
he
liked
the
job
as
far
as
she
could
see
it
gave
him
more
time
to
spend
in
the
village
saloon
one
thing
she
had
never
been
able
to
understand
in
her
heart
she
was
certain
that
james
was
terrified
of
the
animals
she
had
seen
him
shoot
a
dog
at
the
slightest
provocation
but
until
she
had
seen
the
chow
she
had
never
bothered
with
the
beasts
she
had
cooked
their
meals
but
she
had
not
been
allowed
to
feed
them
she
had
watched
them
from
the
outside
of
the
kennels
but
she
had
never
gone
in
to
them
she
had
tolerated
their
racket
because
she
had
never
fully
understood
what
lay
in
back
of
it
all
and
then
the
chow
came
james
had
brought
home
in
the
old
runabout
brought
him
to
the
kennels
tied
down
in
a
great
basket
she
had
not
paid
much
attention
to
either
man
or
dog
the
first
sight
that
she
had
of
the
chow
had
been
because
of
james
she
had
heard
his
cursing
and
the
crack
of
his
huge
whip
she
had
gone
out
on
the
porch
then
and
had
seen
the
man
beating
the
dog
with
all
his
strength
the
man
swearing
loudly
and
furiously
and
the
chow
silent
she
had
never
gotten
over
that
spectacle
it
was
the
first
time
she
had
ever
seen
a
dog
maintain
silence
and
then
day
after
day
she
had
watched
chained
there
and
so
strangely
silent
among
all
those
yapping
yipping
dogs
he
alone
had
remained
quiet
and
the
other
animals
had
paid
scant
attention
to
him
after
the
first
short
while
even
in
their
wild
racing
about
the
enclosure
they
had
given
him
a
wide
berth
there
was
something
magnificent
something
almost
majestic
in
the
chow
aloofness
if
it
had
not
been
for
the
dog
eyes
she
would
have
thought
him
dumb
a
fool
but
the
eyes
haunted
her
great
liquid
brown
eyes
that
met
hers
with
unutterable
sadness
eyes
that
clutched
and
held
on
to
her
with
the
depths
of
their
sorrow
she
made
up
her
mind
after
the
first
month
that
she
must
free
the
dog
that
she
must
get
him
out
of
the
kennels
somehow
or
other
she
had
never
thought
of
a
direct
appeal
to
james
if
it
had
not
been
for
the
way
he
had
goaded
her
this
evening
she
would
never
have
spoken
as
she
did
only
she
had
always
known
that
it
would
not
be
in
her
power
to
let
the
dog
escape
from
the
kennels
without
his
finding
who
had
done
it
without
bearing
the
brunt
of
his
inevitable
rage
and
after
the
first
month
she
began
almost
unconsciously
to
associate
herself
with
the
chow
to
put
herself
in
his
place
as
she
commenced
to
understand
what
his
desires
for
freedom
must
be
so
she
first
realized
that
those
same
desires
were
hers
only
as
she
phrased
it
to
herself
she
could
stand
it
a
lot
better
than
the
chow
dogs
could
not
reason
she
could
go
on
existing
this
way
till
the
end
of
her
days
but
she
felt
that
if
could
not
be
freed
that
he
would
die
she
could
not
bear
the
thought
of
that
whatever
happened
to
the
dog
would
happen
to
that
part
of
her
which
had
come
into
being
when
the
dog
had
come
the
moonlight
trickled
further
and
further
into
the
room
the
stream
of
it
spilled
itself
wider
and
wider
along
the
floor
she
could
hear
the
man
deep
breathing
now
and
then
punctuated
by
a
guttural
snore
the
eerie
baying
of
the
dogs
and
out
there
the
one
silent
dog
chained
to
the
not
one
moment
longer
could
she
endure
it
very
stealthily
she
got
up
and
slipped
on
her
skirt
shoeless
and
stockingless
she
crept
out
into
the
hall
and
down
the
stairs
unbolting
the
front
door
she
paused
an
instant
to
hear
if
she
had
been
detected
with
strained
ears
she
listened
for
those
harsh
snores
but
the
house
was
very
still
she
could
not
hear
his
breathing
from
where
she
was
if
only
he
would
snore
she
waited
the
sound
came
to
her
at
last
she
hurried
out
on
to
the
porch
the
dampness
of
the
summer
night
was
all
about
her
overhead
the
pale
flecks
of
innumerable
stars
and
the
far
cold
light
of
the
waning
moon
from
somewheres
in
the
distance
came
the
monotonous
droning
of
locusts
against
the
dark
clump
of
bushes
darted
the
quick
illusive
glimmer
of
a
she
shivered
as
her
feet
struck
the
chill
wet
grass
and
then
very
slowly
she
went
toward
the
kennels
her
eyes
took
no
note
of
the
dogs
that
lay
on
the
ground
of
the
little
sniffing
here
and
there
along
the
wall
for
rats
of
the
big
and
the
massive
english
bull
reared
on
their
haunches
their
muzzles
lifted
to
the
moon
she
only
saw
chained
to
the
a
pale
blur
in
the
haunting
whitened
light
the
silent
yellow
mass
of
the
chow
she
knew
that
the
great
liquid
brown
eyes
were
fixed
upon
her
she
could
feel
them
drawing
her
on
she
went
toward
him
very
silently
she
went
and
as
she
went
she
mumbled
if
they
start
a
rumpus
the
same
racket
maybe
if
he
wakes
he
think
nothing
of
it
that
is
if
he
ai
enough
awake
to
know
i
there
besides
him
maybe
though
he
wo
wake
maybe
they
wo
make
no
noise
maybe
he
wo
please
gawd
only
to
get
so
that
he
can
feel
free
please
gawd
so
do
have
to
stay
so
that
i
please
gawd
so
i
can
set
something
free
she
suddenly
became
afraid
to
approach
too
silently
afraid
of
the
deafening
uproar
of
a
dog
warning
already
the
had
stopped
his
regular
baying
already
the
little
sniffed
the
air
through
the
wire
netting
sensing
some
one
coming
if
only
she
had
thought
to
get
them
some
bones
if
only
she
had
a
piece
of
meat
a
anything
to
throw
to
them
to
keep
them
quiet
but
she
had
not
had
time
to
think
of
that
she
began
to
whistle
softly
and
then
a
bit
louder
as
she
realized
that
she
had
whistled
the
call
of
the
the
got
to
his
feet
she
could
hear
the
sinister
rumbling
of
his
throaty
snarling
she
saw
the
waddling
clumsily
after
him
they
stood
there
their
coats
bristling
their
ears
erect
their
muzzles
poked
into
the
wire
netting
and
then
a
quick
bark
from
quite
the
other
side
of
the
kennels
she
felt
that
numberless
small
eyes
were
peering
out
at
her
with
betraying
cunning
it
seemed
to
her
that
innumerable
dogs
were
rising
from
the
ground
were
rushing
to
the
walls
were
tearing
out
of
their
separate
kennels
she
called
then
called
very
low
in
the
hope
that
they
might
know
her
voice
oh
she
was
face
to
face
with
it
now
all
through
the
day
she
managed
somehow
to
bear
with
it
hideous
as
it
was
deafening
so
that
she
could
not
hear
hated
so
that
it
made
her
physically
and
now
in
the
dead
of
night
it
was
let
loose
with
the
unlimited
stillness
of
the
night
vibrating
in
grotesque
yapping
echo
with
the
cold
light
of
the
moon
spotting
uncanny
over
the
kennels
she
had
it
the
yelping
the
shrill
prolonged
whines
the
quick
incessant
barking
and
running
in
growling
the
throaty
infuriated
snarling
she
knew
then
that
it
was
quite
beyond
hope
that
james
should
not
hear
them
she
had
to
hurry
she
began
to
run
and
all
the
while
she
called
in
the
same
low
voice
i
coming
to
you
oh
she
pulled
back
the
stiff
iron
bolts
it
took
all
her
strength
to
do
that
she
opened
the
gate
a
bit
and
slipped
in
pushing
it
to
behind
her
and
then
she
was
among
them
their
noise
increased
in
volume
pitched
in
a
shriller
note
the
sudden
rush
of
them
threw
her
off
her
feet
some
of
them
leaped
on
her
she
felt
a
sharp
stinging
nip
in
her
wrist
in
a
second
she
was
up
again
down
she
commanded
down
she
went
toward
the
chow
pushing
the
other
dogs
out
of
her
way
with
both
hands
stumbling
stepping
over
them
as
they
crowded
about
her
feet
down
she
murmured
breathless
it
was
not
until
she
got
well
within
a
couple
of
strides
of
the
chow
that
the
other
dogs
dropped
away
from
her
it
was
the
same
thing
that
she
had
witnessed
a
hundred
times
from
her
window
the
animals
had
always
given
a
wide
berth
had
always
respected
his
magnificent
majestic
aloofness
and
as
she
reached
him
she
fell
to
her
knees
she
whispered
brokenly
her
arms
went
around
the
dog
neck
her
hands
stroked
the
thick
ruff
at
his
throat
she
felt
a
cold
nose
on
her
cheek
a
slow
deep
sniffing
a
second
later
two
heavy
paws
were
on
her
shoulder
and
a
warm
moist
tongue
curled
again
and
again
about
her
ear
in
the
moonlight
she
looked
into
his
eyes
the
great
liquid
brown
eyes
met
hers
with
all
their
unutterable
sadness
want
to
go
she
murmured
want
to
go
and
be
free
her
fingers
were
working
swiftly
at
his
collar
as
it
clanked
to
the
ground
she
felt
him
stiffen
rigidly
beneath
her
touch
she
saw
his
ears
go
back
flat
against
his
head
she
saw
his
upper
lip
pulled
so
that
the
long
sharp
teeth
showed
glisteningly
in
the
blue
gums
she
followed
the
set
stare
of
his
eyes
and
what
she
saw
sent
a
shiver
down
her
spine
coming
across
the
waste
that
had
once
been
a
garden
running
stumblingly
in
the
full
path
of
the
moonlight
came
james
and
the
other
dogs
had
seen
him
she
realized
that
when
she
heard
the
growling
the
snarling
the
low
infuriated
snorts
she
rushed
back
to
the
gate
james
saw
her
then
get
away
he
shouted
get
away
from
there
she
threw
the
gate
open
and
stood
leaning
against
it
to
keep
it
wide
she
called
come
on
but
it
was
the
other
dogs
that
tore
past
her
first
one
then
another
then
two
together
and
then
the
whole
wild
panting
pack
of
them
for
gawd
sake
the
man
shrieked
get
get
the
words
were
lost
in
his
breathless
choking
the
was
the
last
to
go
for
a
second
he
stood
beside
her
she
bent
over
him
she
was
afraid
to
touch
him
afraid
that
at
that
moment
her
hands
might
involuntarily
hold
him
go
on
she
urged
frantically
go
on
hey
you
the
man
stormed
at
the
dogs
here
here
he
whistled
here
boy
here
old
fellow
come
on
he
suddenly
stood
still
he
tried
to
make
his
whistling
persuasive
he
was
out
of
breath
when
he
saw
that
they
would
not
come
to
him
he
ran
after
them
they
scattered
pellmell
before
him
she
saw
them
disappearing
in
every
direction
some
of
them
slinking
away
with
their
tails
between
their
legs
some
of
them
crawling
into
the
bushes
on
their
bellies
some
of
them
rushing
racing
madly
into
the
night
only
the
yellow
mass
of
the
went
in
even
padded
patter
out
toward
the
road
she
waited
there
for
james
she
could
not
think
she
only
waited
and
at
last
he
came
back
you
his
voice
was
low
you
the
words
were
smothered
in
his
anger
she
smiled
then
she
thought
that
she
still
could
hear
the
even
padded
patter
of
the
dog
jogging
to
his
freedom
so
you
turned
on
me
you
know
what
going
to
happen
to
you
dare
to
think
her
voice
was
filled
with
a
strange
calm
i
do
care
james
i
do
care
none
i
set
loose
his
face
leered
at
her
evilly
in
the
moonlight
you
ai
got
no
excuses
you
do
even
make
no
excuses
to
me
huh
no
james
no
her
tone
was
exultant
the
even
padded
patter
was
still
in
her
ears
it
seemed
so
near
she
saw
the
man
raised
fist
the
coarse
bulging
hammer
of
it
she
felt
that
something
was
behind
her
she
turned
the
chow
stood
there
his
ears
back
his
coat
bristling
the
hairs
standing
on
end
in
tremendous
bushiness
his
fangs
laid
bare
there
he
crouched
drawn
together
ready
to
spring
the
man
took
a
step
toward
her
out
of
the
corner
of
her
eyes
she
could
see
the
huge
taut
fist
i
would
do
that
james
she
said
quietly
i
just
would
you
live
to
rue
the
day
the
words
came
hoarsely
gutturally
going
to
beat
you
woman
i
going
to
beat
you
damn
good
you
ai
she
said
look
james
she
pointed
to
the
chow
call
him
off
the
man
shrieked
want
him
to
kill
me
she
saw
him
trembling
with
fear
paralyzed
with
terror
so
that
his
clenched
hand
still
reached
above
his
head
shaking
she
thought
then
of
the
pistol
he
always
carried
with
him
for
the
second
time
she
smiled
she
saw
him
try
to
take
a
step
backwards
his
knees
almost
gave
way
under
him
the
chow
wormed
a
bit
nearer
call
him
off
take
him
away
damn
you
speak
to
him
for
sake
do
something
he
whined
she
looked
at
the
man
cowed
abjectly
afraid
she
had
nothing
more
to
fear
from
him
he
was
beaten
her
hand
went
out
until
it
rested
on
the
dog
head
it
all
right
it
all
right
now
she
felt
the
great
eyes
fixed
on
her
face
she
felt
that
he
was
waiting
you
can
go
on
james
go
on
into
the
house
what
what
mean
he
stuttered
i
going
she
said
me
and
i
told
you
i
go
when
i
was
ready
but
i
was
going
alone
that
what
you
ai
understood
james
now
we
both
going
and
you
better
be
meandering
up
to
your
house
or
maybe
he
be
getting
tired
of
waiting
slowly
the
man
turned
ponderously
his
figure
huddled
together
he
started
back
stumbling
along
in
the
full
path
of
the
moonlight
she
thought
she
saw
his
fingers
fumbling
to
his
stop
she
called
none
of
that
james
this
here
one
time
when
that
there
gun
do
work
i
ai
got
no
gun
the
mumbled
words
came
back
to
her
indistinctly
think
if
i
have
had
stand
where
you
are
and
do
you
make
no
move
from
there
we
be
on
our
way
now
he
stood
still
come
on
she
started
toward
the
road
the
dog
at
her
heels
once
as
she
went
she
turned
to
look
at
the
emptied
quiet
kennels
at
the
moonlight
drenched
waste
that
had
once
been
a
garden
at
the
huddled
figure
of
the
man
standing
there
so
silently
james
she
called
out
in
the
road
she
paused
to
look
up
and
down
the
long
white
stretch
of
it
the
chow
stopped
at
her
side
his
great
liquid
brown
eyes
were
raised
to
hers
she
could
feel
his
impatience
to
be
off
suddenly
he
started
her
feet
followed
those
padded
pattering
feet
aw
she
whispered
aw
the
wood
of
living
trees
i
do
hereby
swear
and
take
unto
myself
right
solemnly
and
in
most
sacred
oath
before
the
lord
god
to
prove
myself
innocent
of
this
most
awful
and
hideous
crime
for
the
which
in
the
morning
i
do
swing
by
the
neck
i
cedric
of
hampden
do
swear
to
show
with
the
righteous
help
of
most
high
god
that
it
is
not
i
who
beareth
the
blood
guilt
of
the
murther
of
the
lady
is
in
this
world
a
certain
devilish
influence
that
worketh
most
evilly
against
the
high
heavens
and
the
good
in
man
and
the
which
doeth
foully
with
the
flesh
of
man
and
bringeth
the
soul
of
him
unto
the
stinking
depths
of
hell
i
cedric
of
hampden
having
scant
knowledge
of
the
meanings
of
witchcraft
or
of
magic
either
black
or
white
have
many
times
and
oft
felt
the
spell
which
lyeth
so
infernally
the
wood
of
living
trees
i
who
loveth
the
lady
beatrix
who
did
meet
her
death
the
while
she
wandered
within
the
confines
of
the
wood
of
living
trees
searching
therein
for
the
crucifix
which
she
did
lose
from
off
her
neck
do
accuse
no
one
of
the
killing
of
her
whom
i
loved
yet
unto
myself
i
do
confess
the
knowledge
of
this
evil
thing
the
which
i
have
assured
myself
hath
the
power
at
all
times
to
become

i
prove
at
some
unknown
time

i
show
that
in
this
world
a
certain
devilish
influence
worketh
most
evilly
against
the
high
heavens
and
the
good
in
man
i
do
confess
the
knowing
of
this
to
be
true
and
many
times
and
oft
have
i
convinced
myself
that
this
satanic
thing
hath
the
power
to
become
the
morning
i
hang
god
the
father

the
son
come
unto
me
in
purgatory
that
i
may
fulfill
my
sacred
oath
and
that
the
soul
of
her
i
love
may
find
peace
within
the
seven
golden
gates
of
at
first
there
was
not
one
of
them
who
noticed
it
strange
that
people
who
are
forever
entertaining
are
so
very
apt
to
disregard
the
congeniality
of
their
guests
perhaps
they
become
calloused
probably
they
grow
tired
of
a
ceaseless
picking
and
choosing
after
a
while
they
caught
on
to
it
it
was
one
of
those
things
that
could
not
be
avoided
gregory
manners
never
was
the
sort
of
chap
to
conceal
his
feelings
and
very
evidently
he
had
most
decided
ones
in
regard
to
the
russian
stephanof
andreyvitch
he
was
much
in
vogue
was
andreyvitch
it
was
considered
rather
a
stunt
to
get
him
to
come
to
one
of
your
dinners
he
was
tremendously
in
demand
not
that
andreyvitch
had
ever
done
anything
to
make
himself
famous
it
was
just
the
personality
of
the
man
women
would
tell
you
that
he
was
fascinating
different
of
course
there
were
some
of
them
the
stupid
fastidious
ones
who
took
offense
at
his
looks
no
one
could
ever
say
they
were
in
any
way
prepossessing
he
was
fairly
well
built
extremely
sinewy
his
arms
were
noticeably
long
and
he
had
an
odd
fashion
of
always
walking
on
the
balls
of
his
feet
add
to
that
a
rather
narrow
face
a
heavy
nose
eyes
a
bit
too
close
together
and
a
shock
of
hair
which
grew
over
his
head
and
face
in
great
abundance
most
men
would
not
pretend
to
understand
him
he
was
at
all
times
courteous
perhaps
even
too
suavely
polite
for
the
temperament
he
aired
his
views
with
a
wonderful
assurance
views
that
had
to
do
chiefly
with
æstheticism
and
a
violent
disregard
of
all
conventional
thought
when
andreyvitch
spoke
one
had
the
feeling
that
he
feared
to
express
himself
too
well
that
after
all
his
wicked
disbelief
in
the
things
in
which
most
men
placed
their
entire
faith
was
something
actually
a
part
of
him
something
which
might
even
cause
the
amazing
heathenism
of
his
talk
to
be
somewhat
subdued
and
when
stephanof
andreyvitch
spoke
one
could
not
help
but
notice
his
teeth
yellow
horridly
decayed
things
they
were
with
the
two
on
either
side
surprisingly
pointed
like
fangs
of
course
in
his
way
gregory
manners
was
a
bit
of
a
lion
it
was
that
which
undoubtedly
made
them
attribute
his
dislike
of
the
russian
to
jealousy
at
least
at
first
afterwards
they
found
plenty
of
other
reasons
naturally
one
of
them
was
kathleen
but
that
came
much
later
on
he
had
traveled
all
over
the
world
had
manners
and
he
wrote
charmingly
vague
bits
that
one
read
and
then
forgot
he
took
himself
very
seriously
he
was
one
of
those
men
who
believe
firmly
and
basically
that
they
are
sent
into
this
world
with
a
mission
to
perform
one
could
not
actually
tell
whether
manners
really
thought
his
writing
to
be
his
life
work
his
best
friends
maintained
that
he
had
not
as
yet
found
himself
but
no
one
bothered
to
ask
him
the
question
his
work
was
good
he
was
a
distinctly
decent
sort
of
chap
utterly
british
and
he
was
above
all
else
exceedingly
interesting
for
the
most
part
people
were
really
fond
of
manners
and
he
fond
of
them
the
first
time
andreyvitch
and
manners
were
introduced
manners
had
the
feeling
that
they
had
met
at
some
time
before
he
even
asked
the
russian
if
it
had
not
been
in
moscow
when
andreyvitch
told
him
that
he
had
never
in
his
whole
life
seen
him
and
that
he
positively
regretted
not
having
done
so
manners
attitude
underwent
a
sudden
and
unexpected
change
he
became
silent
almost
morose
he
kept
away
from
andreyvitch
all
evening
and
yet
he
stayed
near
enough
to
him
to
watch
his
every
move
after
that
night
manners
decided
he
hated
andreyvitch
that
he
knew
the
man
was
a
liar
an
impostor
not
at
the
time
that
he
was
in
any
way
jealous
of
the
russian
still
there
was
a
strange
familiar
feeling
there
that
he
had
felt
at
some
other
time
and
in
connection
with
the
same
man
he
could
have
sworn
he
had
known
him
before
it
was
the
only
way
then
in
which
he
could
explain
the
thing
to
himself
with
any
degree
of
coherence
it
was
never
difficult
to
get
gregory
manners
to
speak
of
the
first
evening
he
met
andreyvitch
it
was
almost
as
if
he
were
tremendously
puzzled
as
if
he
thought
speaking
of
it
even
to
a
casual
acquaintance
might
clear
things
up
to
himself
he
never
varied
the
thing
at
first
at
any
rate
later
on
he
became
strangely
uncannily
secretive
about
it
all
that
must
have
been
when
he
began
to
suspect
there
was
a
great
deal
more
to
it
than
had
appeared
upon
the
surface
know
his
words
always
came
slowly
deuce
take
it
i
thought
i
was
going
to
like
the
fellow
i
heard
so
much
about
him
too
why
old
chap
i
was
anxious
positively
keen
to
know
him
and
then
why
when
i
stood
face
to
face
with
him
i
could
think
of
anything
but
that
i
had
known
him
or
did
know
him
or
something
first
glance
and
i
saw
he
was
one
of
those
poseurs
one
of
those
rummy
fellows
who
affect
poses
because
they
always
consciously
trying
to
imitate
the
people
about
them
that
it
you
know
they
ca
be
themselves
because
of
some
queer
kink
they
funk
expressing
so
they
fake
other
people
and
quite
naturally
they
overdo
it
he
would
usually
get
worked
up
about
this
time
and
then
he
would
go
on
a
lot
more
quickly
i
seen
them
the
world
over
there
was
one
chap
but
well
i
thought
this
this
fellow
who
calls
himself
andreyvitch
was
just
going
to
be
one
of
them
poseurs
you
know
he
looked
harmless
enough
to
be
sure
of
course
there
were
his
eyes
and
the
way
he
walks
but
then
i
could
help
feeling
he
was
quite
quite
cricket
that
came
over
me
confoundedly
strongly
at
the
very
first
minute
and
when
he
smiled
i
say
man
ever
see
such
damnably
wicked
teeth
and
the
man
to
whom
he
spoke
always
had
to
admit
that
he
had
never
seen
such
teeth
later
on
manners
never
worked
himself
up
as
much
that
fellow
who
calls
himself
andreyvitch
i
met
him
before
know
where
and
at
that
i
a
pretty
fair
head
for
names
and
places
but
i
know
him
he
may
have
looked
differently
and
it
probably
was
in
some
of
those
holes
but
i
know
him
i
do
say
he
was
the
russian
andreyvitch
when
i
knew
him
but
well
old
chap
see
they
stopped
asking
andreyvitch
and
manners
around
together
after
a
while
but
that
never
kept
manners
from
speaking
of
the
russian
was
andreyvitch
there
they
do
ask
us
together
eh
no
fear
old
chap
of
my
insulting
him
i
could
you
know
rather
a
filthy
sort
of
beggar
that
russian
makes
the
gooseflesh
come
over
me
happened
before
deuce
take
the
thing
if
i
could
only
think
when
and
then
after
manners
had
dropped
out
of
sight
for
a
fortnight
or
more
he
suddenly
made
his
appearance
at
the
club
they
were
all
of
them
unspeakably
shocked
by
his
looks
he
never
carried
much
weight
but
in
those
two
weeks
he
had
gotten
down
to
little
else
than
skin
and
bones
his
color
was
ghastly
his
cheekbones
were
appallingly
prominent
and
his
eyes
looked
as
if
they
were
sunken
back
into
his
skull
to
all
their
questions
he
gave
the
same
answer
no
he
was
no
he
had
been
ill
there
was
nothing
the
matter
with
him
he
felt
a
bit
seedy
and
he
run
down
to
his
place
for
a
fortnight
it
was
good
of
them
to
bother
he
was
quite
quite
all
right
they
saw
he
wanted
to
be
left
alone
and
they
let
him
go
over
to
the
window
and
sit
there
his
great
loose
frame
huddled
together
in
the
leather
arm
chair
there
could
not
have
been
more
than
three
or
four
of
them
sitting
near
him
it
was
only
those
three
or
four
who
saw
him
stagger
to
his
feet
swaying
there
dizzily
for
a
second
only
those
three
or
four
who
could
distinguish
the
words
spoken
in
that
low
half
strangled
whisper
that
it
i
got
it
now
something
rotten
always
living
always
waiting
the
chance
to
do
its
filthy
harm
the
power
to
incarnate
in
any
form
the
greater
its
loathsomeness
the
greater
that
incarnating
stuff
probably
at
most
times
more
beast
than
human
but
it
could
take
on
human
guise
that
it
that
and
those
three
or
four
men
saw
him
rush
out
of
the
his
head
thrown
well
back
his
eyes
ablaze
with
a
great
light
and
then
gave
the
famous
the
of
which
every
member
although
not
fully
understanding
tried
to
forget
the
which
drove
gregory
manners
and
kathleen
bennet
out
of
england
was
a
charming
little
american
widow
with
untold
wealth
and
a
desire
to
do
everything
everywhere
with
every
one
of
course
she
always
managed
to
get
a
lot
of
nice
people
together
and
of
course
she
picked
the
very
nicest
ones
for
her
then
because
she
had
set
her
heart
on
having
the
russian
stephanof
andreyvitch
she
naturally
got
him
to
come
and
because
she
had
kathleen
bennet
she
had
to
ask
gregory
kathleen
and
gregory
were
engaged
to
be
married
she
was
a
dear
was
kathleen
as
pretty
as
a
picture
and
delightfully
her
father
belonged
to
the
clergy
and
her
family
consisted
of
innumerable
brothers
and
sisters
gregory
manners
who
had
traveled
the
world
over
fell
quite
completely
in
love
with
her
and
she
she
worshiped
the
ground
he
walked
on
no
one
ever
quite
knew
whether
or
not
manners
heard
that
andreyvitch
was
to
be
of
the
perhaps
he
had
probably
he
had
not
if
kathleen
were
to
be
there
that
would
have
been
as
far
as
manners
was
concerned
by
that
time
manners
had
worked
himself
out
of
his
frenzy
of
hatred
against
the
russian
they
had
been
able
to
explain
it
to
themselves
by
saying
that
he
had
talked
himself
into
it
as
a
matter
of
fact
the
whole
thing
was
totally
subconscious
whenever
he
had
become
conscious
the
man
was
anywhere
near
him
he
had
begun
to
realize
his
hatred
of
him
but
now
it
had
gone
infinitely
further
than
just
that
manners
had
become
uncannily
quiet
and
uncannily
knowing
they
were
all
together
in
the
hall
when
manners
as
usual
came
in
late
and
an
anæmic
looking
youth
who
always
lounged
about
in
her
wake
a
man
named
galvin
an
oldish
chap
who
had
seen
service
in
india
and
his
pretty
young
wife
the
dowager
of
endon
and
her
son
the
duke
and
stephanof
andreyvitch
holding
the
center
of
the
floor
with
little
kathleen
bennet
sitting
close
to
where
he
stood
her
eyes
fixed
in
awed
surprise
upon
his
face
her
white
fingers
toying
nervously
with
a
small
silver
crucifix
which
hung
about
her
neck
whether
or
not
andreyvitch
heard
the
man
announce
gregory
manners
whether
or
not
he
saw
him
standing
there
in
the
doorway
whether
or
not
he
purposely
went
on
with
what
he
was
then
saying
was
a
subject
for
debate
the
rest
of
the
evening
faith
andreyvitch
low
insidious
voice
carried
well
but
no
such
thing
ca
you
realize
that
all
this
sickly
sentimentality
is
nothing
but
dogmatic
idiocy
on
your
parts
must
you
all
drivel
your
catechism
at
every
turn
of
the
road
must
you
close
your
eyes
to
filth
to
vice
to
everything
you
think
outside
of
your
smug
english
minds
do
you
know
you
a
part
of
it
that
each
one
of
you
is
part
of
the
lowest
rottenest
it
was
then
that
unable
to
stand
it
a
second
longer
gregory
manners
came
into
the
room
i
i
most
sincerely
hope
i
not
interrupting
andreyvitch
but
are
you
speaking
of
those
things
again
the
quiet
polite
tone
was
full
of
subtle
significance
and
although
they
could
not
have
known
what
manners
actually
meant
they
all
of
them
recognized
an
emphatic
significance
and
not
one
of
those
people
present
could
overlook
the
peculiar
stress
which
he
had
laid
upon
that
again
andreyvitch
turned
sharply
his
face
for
a
second
drawn
into
a
hideous
ghastly
grimace
it
is
no
interruption
mr
manners
he
was
trying
hard
to
resume
his
habitual
insouciance
but
what
do
you
mean
eh
what
is
this
he
stood
where
he
was
did
manners
his
face
was
almost
expressionless
i
think
you
know
what
i
mean
but
see
here
i
repeat
it
for
you
if
you
like
listen
this
time
are
you
speaking
of
those
things
the
russian
was
livid
and
for
an
infinitesimal
fraction
of
time
it
seemed
to
those
watching
him
that
he
was
cowed
terrifyingly
cowed
your
humor
he
shrugged
his
shoulders
endeavoring
to
pass
the
thing
off
as
flippantly
as
possible
your
humor
is
bizarre
mr
manners
i
spoke
but
of
that
which
we
all
know
exists
surely
there
is
no
harm
in
speaking
of
what
we
all
recognize
manners
voice
rang
out
clearly
in
surprising
sternness
we
all
know
what
exists
in
this
world
we
know
that
greater
than
all
else
is
faith
as
long
as
you
speak
before
those
who
know
what
real
goodness
is
who
believe
in
it
there
is
no
harm
done
i
hardly
think
this
is
the
first
time
you
tried
to
impress
evil
on
people
the
reason
for
that
easily
understood
but
thank
god
his
tone
vibrated
with
earnestness
thank
god
you
can
do
nothing
here
the
russian
turned
on
him
his
usual
suave
manner
had
left
him
his
words
were
little
else
than
an
angry
snarl
you
know
me
well
very
well
indeed
my
english
friend
you
who
have
met
me
is
it
not
once
perhaps
eh
twice
manners
laughed
a
laugh
that
had
no
sound
of
mirth
in
it
i
met
you
again
and
again
and
you
know
it
and
there
something
else
we
have
to
settle
for
and
you
know
that
too
mr
andreyvitch
and
then
gregory
manners
turned
to
good
afternoon
he
said
quietly
a
bit
flustered
the
hostess
got
hastily
to
her
feet
so
good
of
you
to
come
you
know
every
one
do
you
gregory
have
your
tea
here
with
us
and
below
her
breath
she
added
you
must
be
too
hard
on
andreyvitch
gregory
these
russians
well
they
all
a
bit
primitive
he
went
from
one
to
the
other
of
the
men
he
kissed
kathleen
hand
and
told
her
how
pretty
she
looked
he
let
pour
his
tea
and
he
ignored
the
russian
completely
the
while
he
watched
kathleen
with
a
strange
foreboding
as
her
eyes
flickered
again
and
again
over
andreyvitch
face
things
did
not
go
very
smoothly
during
the
next
two
days
naturally
they
all
did
the
usual
golf
and
riding
bridge
and
dancing
in
the
evenings
and
shooting
andreyvitch
was
passionately
fond
of
shooting
manners
had
never
so
much
as
killed
a
sparrow
in
all
his
life
there
was
an
undercurrent
of
uneasiness
which
permeated
the
entire
household
it
was
not
particularly
because
of
andreyvitch
and
manners
it
was
something
that
not
one
of
them
could
have
explained
if
they
had
been
put
to
it
the
first
day
galvin
told
her
husband
that
she
would
be
glad
when
it
was
all
over
and
although
unexpressed
that
was
the
general
sentiment
not
that
andreyvitch
or
manners
made
the
others
uncomfortable
after
gregory
first
outburst
and
now
that
they
were
under
the
same
roof
it
rather
seemed
that
the
russian
avoided
manners
and
manners
he
watched
carefully
every
movement
every
little
turn
or
twist
of
andreyvitch
at
that
time
it
was
as
if
he
were
trying
to
substantiate
some
memory
of
his
to
substantiate
it
deliberately
and
positively
and
then
because
of
andreyvitch
unceasing
attentions
to
kathleen
bennet
word
went
round
among
the
various
members
of
the
that
gregory
and
kathleen
had
quarreled
it
was
sunday
afternoon
when
manners
came
upon
kathleen
walking
alone
in
the
i
be
jolly
well
glad
he
told
her
when
we
get
back
to
town
again
are
you
having
a
good
time
greg
how
can
i
but
you
really
needed
the
rest
you
have
been
looking
any
too
fit
you
know
i
thought
this
would
be
quite
nice
for
you
greg
he
let
loose
at
that
if
you
must
have
it
kathleen
i
ca
stand
you
and
that
bounder
in
the
same
house
that
the
truth
of
it
old
girl
she
avoided
answering
him
directly
it
such
a
ripping
place
here
gregory
all
that
is
all
but
those
forests
over
there
the
gardener
told
me
his
grandfather
used
to
call
them
the
wood
of
living
trees
he
could
tell
me
why
only
is
it
a
strange
name
greg
she
wound
up
lamely
evidently
she
had
not
said
what
she
started
out
to
say
not
so
awfully
he
answered
it
probably
an
old
old
name
they
stick
to
places
you
know
but
the
woods
she
went
on
slowly
they
so
dark
and
mysterious
and
all
that
sort
of
thing
i
wanted
to
explore
them
ever
since
i
been
here
that
is
that
not
altogether
true
gregory
they
frighten
me
a
good
bit
especially
at
night
i
get
into
quite
a
funk
about
it
at
night
i
say
you
would
call
me
a
coward
would
you
gregory
of
course
not
kathleen
what
utter
nonsense
but
if
i
were
afraid
she
continued
half
to
herself
if
i
really
terrified
i
go
into
the
woods
and
show
myself
there
nothing
to
be
frightened
of
would
i
you
most
certainly
would
not
he
said
if
you
did
you
be
sure
to
lose
your
way
old
girl
for
a
second
they
walked
in
silence
ever
feel
she
turned
to
face
him
ever
feel
you
been
in
a
place
before
and
yet
you
knew
you
never
been
there
at
all
no
he
told
her
a
bit
too
abruptly
you
need
be
so
stuffy
gregory
she
murmured
oh
my
dear
he
caught
her
and
held
her
in
his
arms
ca
you
see
that
it
all
like
a
horrible
nightmare
ca
you
see
that
i
not
able
to
know
positively
until
it
actually
happened
and
then
oh
my
god
if
it
should
be
too
late
her
hands
clenched
rigidly
on
his
shoulders
gregory
she
whispered
tell
me
dear
you
been
so
strange
of
late
so
terribly
unlike
yourself
tell
me
dear
what
is
it
nothing
dearest
girl
nothing
oh
but
there
is
something
she
exclaimed
passionately
i
known
it
right
along
i
have
asked
because
i
thought
you
tell
me
why
one
must
be
blind
not
to
see
how
you
changed
you
you
just
a
skeleton
of
yourself
gregory
she
paused
for
breath
ca
you
bring
yourself
to
tell
me
ca
you
dear
if
i
only
knew
he
muttered
if
i
only
knew
for
certain
her
eyes
were
lifted
to
his
the
brows
met
in
a
puckering
frown
above
them
gregory
that
time
you
were
away
for
a
whole
fortnight
did
anything
happen
then
gregory
did
anything
happen
she
had
surprised
him
into
it
good
god
did
anything
happen
why
you
do
know
what
it
was
like
you
know
if
they
told
me
such
a
thing
were
possible
i
should
have
believed
it
i
wanted
to
think
i
wanted
to
work
the
thing
out
for
myself
so
i
went
down
there
for
a
rest
rest
he
broke
off
then
but
she
stood
very
silently
beside
him
and
presently
he
went
on
again
have
you
ever
felt
you
were
going
mad
kathleen
raving
tearing
mad
that
how
i
felt
for
two
weeks
i
thought
it
would
never
end
and
all
the
time
why
i
could
think
i
could
do
anything
but
feel
that
something
was
driving
me
to
do
something
something
tremendous
as
if
the
very
force
of
my
own
life
were
making
me
do
this
thing
that
i
had
been
sent
into
life
to
do
and
kathleen
his
voice
sank
to
a
hoarse
whisper
i
could
understand
what
it
was
she
put
her
arm
about
his
neck
and
drew
his
head
down
until
her
cheek
rested
on
his
i
could
think
a
thought
he
muttered
i
laid
myself
open
to
the
thing
it
just
swept
over
me
and
through
me
it
saturated
me
with
the
impulse
to
do
the
thing
i
had
come
into
the
world
to
do
the
one
thing
that
stood
out
was
the
feeling
that
it
would
have
to
be
done
soon
he
paused
for
a
moment
and
then
one
afternoon
at
the
club
when
been
back
a
day
or
two
something
came
to
sudden
knowledge
of
well
of
rottenness
that
that
might
have
to
be
done
away
with
as
if
that
had
something
to
do
with
it
only
i
do
know
kathleen
not
as
yet
he
looked
at
her
then
and
he
saw
her
eyes
were
filled
with
tears
he
thought
he
had
frightened
her
he
waited
until
he
had
himself
well
in
hand
before
he
spoke
again
kathleen
always
believe
in
the
good
of
things
dearest
girl
and
kathleen
the
words
that
came
to
him
were
almost
as
great
a
surprise
to
him
as
they
were
to
her
never
leave
that
crucifix
off
your
neck
promise
me
dear
i
promise
a
little
later
they
went
in
to
tea
he
got
to
bed
that
night
with
a
great
feeling
of
relief
that
in
the
morning
they
would
all
be
back
in
town
he
had
thought
something
would
happen
he
had
not
known
what
but
the
feeling
had
been
there
he
did
not
mind
admitting
it
to
himself
now
and
he
did
not
mind
acknowledging
that
he
could
not
understand
how
the
thing
whatever
it
was
had
been
avoided
unformed
undefinable
it
had
been
powerfully
imminent
he
fell
asleep
wondering
what
it
was
that
he
had
expected
the
full
moon
was
streaming
into
the
room
when
he
awoke
he
was
on
his
feet
in
the
middle
of
the
floor
in
a
flash
he
could
have
sworn
a
cry
had
awakened
him
a
woman
voice
calling
for
help
a
woman
voice
that
had
been
strangely
like
kathleen
he
went
to
the
window
and
looked
out
a
cloud
had
drifted
across
the
surface
of
the
full
moon
the
whole
garden
lay
blotched
with
shadows
and
there
beyond
the
garden
was
the
forest
black
sinister
mysterious
the
dark
depth
of
it
sickened
him
kathleen
had
spoken
only
that
afternoon
of
the
forest
the
wood
of
living
trees
she
had
told
him
it
was
called
the
wood
of
living
trees
in
heaven
name
where
did
the
horrible
appalling
significance
of
the
wood
of
living
trees
come
from
what
was
this
ghastly
knowledge
that
sought
for
recognition
in
his
own
mind
what
did
the
wood
of
living
trees
mean
to
him
and
then
he
heard
the
faint
far
cry
his
shoes
his
trousers
hatless
and
coatless
he
was
out
in
the
garden
the
cloud
had
passed
from
off
the
face
of
the
moon
the
garden
lay
in
the
bright
moonlight
even
the
separate
flowers
were
visible
beyond
was
the
sinister
depth
of
that
black
forest
he
felt
it
then
sensed
the
insidious
evil
of
something
that
emanated
from
the
wood
something
which
lurked
there
beneath
the
trees
something
which
clung
to
the
tall
trunks
of
them
something
which
rose
and
expanded
among
the
leaves
and
reached
out
to
him
in
evil
menace
and
at
some
time
he
had
felt
it
all
before
he
ran
quickly
through
the
garden
over
the
rosebeds
crashing
through
the
high
boxwood
hedge
at
the
farther
end
and
then
into
the
forest
his
feet
sank
into
the
slime
the
trees
were
gigantic
he
felt
as
if
they
were
closing
in
on
him
their
branches
stretched
out
like
living
arms
hindering
his
progress
thorns
caught
at
his
clothing
at
his
hands
his
face
he
had
a
vague
thought
that
the
forest
was
advancing
to
achieve
his
destruction
his
only
clear
determination
was
to
protect
his
eyes
he
knew
then
he
had
always
known
that
the
wood
was
some
live
evil
thing
the
wood
of
living
trees
and
that
it
hid
the
presence
of
something
infinitely
more
foul
a
queer
odor
assailed
his
nostrils
an
odor
that
was
not
only
of
the
damp
dank
underbrush
an
odor
that
in
its
putridness
almost
suffocated
him
breathless
and
half
crazed
with
an
unexplainable
dread
he
fought
the
forest
beating
his
way
with
his
naked
hands
through
the
dense
bushes
and
then
he
heard
a
sound
the
first
sound
he
had
heard
since
entering
the
forest
it
was
quite
distinct
vibrating
loudly
through
the
deadly
stillness
of
the
wood
came
the
steady
patter
of
a
thing
the
next
instant
something
leaped
out
of
the
darkness
something
huge
and
strong
that
tried
to
catch
at
his
neck
he
fought
for
his
life
then
fought
this
horrible
thing
that
had
been
concealed
by
the
forest
fought
with
the
darkness
shutting
down
on
him
and
that
putrid
odor
smothering
his
breathing
panting
and
blinded
he
and
the
thing
swayed
to
and
fro
crashing
against
the
springing
again
and
again
at
each
other
from
the
tangled
underbrush
he
never
knew
how
long
he
struggled
there
in
the
blackness
of
the
wood
it
might
have
been
hours
it
might
have
been
minutes
and
then
he
had
the
beast
by
its
great
hairy
throat
the
infuriated
snarling
grew
weaker
he
felt
the
body
become
rigid
silence
he
threw
the
thing
from
him
he
staggered
farther
into
the
wood
he
had
not
gone
far
when
he
came
upon
kathleen
she
was
walking
uncertainly
toward
him
the
moonlight
trickled
clear
and
yellow
through
the
branches
now
he
could
see
her
lips
moving
moving
he
knew
that
she
was
praying
her
eyes
looked
out
at
him
dazed
and
unseeing
and
in
her
right
hand
that
was
reached
before
her
he
saw
the
little
silver
crucifix
he
did
not
dare
speak
to
her
he
was
afraid
he
sank
back
against
the
bushes
and
let
her
pass
the
moonlight
flooded
the
place
with
its
haunting
golden
light
a
strange
feeling
of
relief
came
over
him
and
with
it
a
vast
calm
and
very
quietly
he
followed
her
she
went
a
bit
further
and
she
came
to
that
spot
where
he
had
killed
the
thing
he
heard
her
shriek
the
wild
cry
that
had
awakened
him
the
wolf
gregory
the
wolf
he
caught
her
in
his
arms
as
she
fainted
then
he
looked
down
there
at
his
feet
lay
the
body
of
the
russian
stephanof
andreyvitch
will
i
prove
at
some
unknown
time
will
i
show
that
in
this
world
a
certain
devilish
influence
worketh
most
evilly
against
the
high
heavens
and
the
good
in
man
i
do
confess
the
knowing
of
this
to
be
true
and
many
times
and
oft
have
i
convinced
myself
that
this
satanic
thing
hath
the
power
to
become
the
morning
i
hang
god
the
father
christ
the
son
come
unto
me
in
purgatory
that
i
may
fulfill
my
sacred
oath
and
that
the
soul
of
her
i
love
may
find
peace
within
the
seven
golden
gates
of
before
the
dawn
he
had
gotten
as
far
as
the
he
could
not
go
on
his
feet
ached
his
eyes
hurt
with
the
incessant
effort
of
trying
to
penetrate
the
obliterating
dark
where
the
three
roads
met
he
stopped
above
him
the
black
unlighted
skies
before
him
mile
upon
mile
of
deep
plain
somewhere
beyond
the
plain
at
the
foot
of
the
hills
lay
charvel
jans
was
waiting
for
him
at
charvel
his
orders
to
meet
jans
were
urgent
but
now
he
could
not
go
further
jans
would
have
to
wait
until
morning
when
by
the
light
of
day
he
could
again
find
the
way
which
he
had
so
completely
lost
in
the
night
he
sank
down
at
the
base
of
the
crucifix
it
loomed
in
a
ghostly
gray
mass
against
the
muddy
white
of
the
clouds
he
pulled
his
coat
collar
up
about
his
ears
his
eyes
were
raised
to
where
he
thought
to
see
the
dimly
defined
christ
figure
but
the
pitch
black
gloom
drenched
opaquely
over
everything
there
was
something
mysterious
something
remote
about
the
cross
he
imagined
peasants
kneeling
before
it
in
awed
reverence
gabbling
their
prayers
the
ignorance
of
such
idolatry
their
prayers
had
not
been
proof
against
the
bullets
and
still
they
prayed
tired
as
he
was
he
laughed
aloud
why
do
you
laugh
he
started
to
his
feet
the
voice
quiet
and
deep
came
from
directly
behind
him
he
had
not
conceived
the
possibility
of
any
human
thing
lurking
so
dangerously
near
he
peered
blindly
through
the
obscuring
dark
who
there
he
questioned
his
fingers
involuntarily
closing
tautly
about
the
butt
of
the
revolver
at
his
belt
you
too
ask
questions
eh
the
voice
went
on
i
can
almost
make
out
the
shape
of
you
do
you
see
me
it
seemed
to
him
then
that
by
carefully
tracing
the
sound
of
the
voice
he
could
dimly
define
the
outline
of
a
man
form
lying
close
within
the
murked
smudging
shadow
of
the
crucifix
yes
i
think
now
i
almost
see
you
his
tone
was
anything
but
assured
what
are
you
doing
here
what
is
there
to
do
but
sleep
the
muttered
words
were
half
defiant
name
of
a
dog
it
was
your
laughter
that
woke
me
why
did
you
laugh
if
i
were
so
tired
i
might
explain
it
to
you
he
hesitated
a
second
playing
for
time
i
was
thinking
drawing
up
a
mental
picture
of
the
ignorant
peasant
praying
here
before
your
my
the
man
voice
was
sleepily
puzzled
it
this
cross
you
mean
eh
well
never
mind
my
fine
fellow
it
has
comfort
and
that
something
to
be
grateful
for
not
the
sort
of
splintery
comfort
i
choose
he
wondered
what
sort
of
a
man
this
was
he
was
used
to
judging
men
at
sight
he
cursed
inwardly
the
unlighted
night
i
not
spending
my
time
out
here
from
choice
i
can
tell
you
that
this
does
for
me
well
enough
i
told
you
did
i
that
i
was
asleep
until
your
stupid
laughing
woke
me
sacré
why
did
you
have
to
laugh
what
the
joke
eh
perhaps
it
my
natural
humor
even
when
i
dead
tired
he
grinned
to
himself
he
had
reached
his
decision
this
sleepy
fool
sounded
safe
enough
besides
the
question
itself
was
he
asked
it
say
do
you
know
the
way
to
charvel
you
miles
from
charvel
my
friend
you
surely
lost
all
sense
of
direction
right
i
do
know
where
i
at
it
this
damned
blackness
never
saw
such
an
infernal
night
started
to
walk
from
chalet
corneille
this
afternoon
did
count
on
its
getting
dark
so
early
then
i
lost
my
way
been
wandering
about
for
hours
probably
in
a
circle
and
now
half
dead
god
i
all
in
it
almost
morning
if
you
wait
for
the
light
you
not
miss
your
road
again
but
i
should
counsel
you
to
try
to
find
it
till
dawn
he
wondered
if
he
dared
to
go
to
sleep
with
this
man
beside
him
there
were
the
papers
carefully
concealed
in
his
right
the
papers
jans
was
waiting
for
the
man
sounded
and
courteous
enough
considering
he
had
been
aroused
from
supposedly
sound
slumber
he
felt
he
was
a
soldier
that
is
he
could
be
one
of
their
men
he
knew
what
their
men
were
like
despite
their
world
reputation
he
had
heard
they
were
anything
but
courteous
but
then
one
never
knew
and
anyway
had
this
man
spoken
to
him
in
irreproachable
french
still
french
was
the
language
of
the
country
and
his
own
gift
of
languages
was
rather
pronounced
of
course
it
tended
to
make
him
a
bit
suspicious
but
logically
he
could
lay
much
stress
on
it
if
only
he
had
gotten
beyond
their
lines
before
night
everything
would
have
been
all
right
as
it
was
he
must
have
been
wandering
round
and
round
covering
the
ground
and
getting
no
nearer
to
charvel
where
jans
was
waiting
for
him
and
the
papers
taking
all
in
all
into
consideration
he
decided
it
best
not
to
let
himself
sleep
even
if
the
staying
awake
was
not
an
easy
plan
for
a
man
utterly
tired
he
would
have
to
do
it
somehow
or
other
you
a
native
of
these
parts
he
asked
trying
to
keep
any
trace
of
speculation
as
to
what
the
man
really
was
out
of
his
voice
sacré
but
i
thought
you
were
about
to
sleep
the
tone
sounded
as
if
it
might
be
angry
i
assure
you
it
will
soon
be
morning
do
feel
like
sleeping
if
you
do
want
to
talk
i
can
easily
be
quiet
no
no
it
makes
no
difference
to
me
i
had
my
forty
winks
talk
if
you
want
not
that
i
was
ever
one
for
doing
much
talking
too
little
of
a
fool
for
that
still
why
do
you
lean
back
here
beside
me
against
this
beam
he
wriggled
backwards
and
propped
his
drooping
head
stiffly
against
the
wood
of
the
cross
i
ca
see
you
at
all
he
closed
his
eyes
it
was
worth
the
throbbing
strain
of
it
to
try
to
penetrate
the
obliterating
dripping
darkness
he
could
do
it
i
like
to
see
you
i
like
to
see
you
my
friend
but
what
good
are
wishes
eh
do
you
say
you
live
at
chalet
corneille
on
the
instant
he
was
alert
why
do
you
ask
curiosity
my
friend
i
know
of
some
good
people
there
by
name
of
fornier
perhaps
they
might
be
friends
of
yours
do
think
i
know
them
he
paused
to
collect
his
wits
he
had
been
startled
by
the
man
suave
question
he
wondered
if
he
was
going
to
try
to
trap
him
he
thought
he
could
have
done
it
more
neatly
himself
this
job
of
stalling
when
he
was
almost
too
tired
to
think
was
an
easy
thing
to
do
he
called
upon
his
imagination
i
an
artist
he
lied
smoothly
sent
over
here
to
paint
war
scenes
i
could
miss
the
chance
of
a
ransacked
village
its
picturesque
value
is
tremendous
just
finished
my
painting
of
chalet
corneille
he
waited
tentatively
surely
if
the
man
were
just
some
simple
sleepy
fool
he
say
something
now
to
give
an
inkling
of
what
he
was
one
week
ago
it
was
splashed
in
blood
soldiers
too
in
their
way
are
artists
was
all
he
said
then
you
not
a
soldier
what
made
you
think
i
was
i
do
know
what
you
are
he
answered
truthfully
and
then
quite
frankly
he
came
back
with
the
man
own
question
did
you
say
lived
in
chalet
corneille
no
i
asked
if
you
knew
people
there
by
name
of
fornier
mighty
few
folk
left
there
now
the
picture
of
the
razed
town
came
before
him
some
old
men
waiting
for
the
lost
ones
to
come
back
to
them
some
young
children
and
three
or
four
sisters
of
charity
and
then
this
morning
i
saw
a
woman
she
was
much
more
than
a
girl
she
had
a
face
you
could
forget
they
told
me
about
her
at
the
inn
where
i
breakfasted
tell
me
the
man
suggested
grudgingly
we
comfortable
enough
dawn
a
long
way
off
and
i
suppose
you
want
to
talk
there
is
much
to
tell
she
left
the
town
was
driven
out
of
it
with
the
others
unlike
them
she
came
back
god
knows
what
she
wanted
to
do
that
for
they
told
me
of
her
goodness
and
her
beauty
and
her
kindness
they
dwelt
on
it
at
great
length
do
know
as
i
blame
them
for
harping
on
all
that
and
now
it
seems
the
spirit
of
the
war
has
lit
upon
even
her
she
changed
they
say
she
absolutely
no
good
these
days
steals
lies
has
done
everything
as
near
as
i
can
make
out
excepting
commit
murder
but
you
ought
to
have
seen
her
face
i
wager
that
once
seen
it
would
rise
to
haunt
any
one
i
do
care
who
it
be
it
was
beautiful
but
he
felt
the
man
look
up
at
the
sky
and
the
ghostly
gray
mass
of
the
crucifix
stretching
across
it
strange
creatures
these
peasant
people
the
man
words
were
speculative
dumb
kind
of
beasts
these
the
best
of
them
got
nothing
in
their
lives
but
work
and
religion
do
know
as
i
blame
you
for
laughing
when
you
looked
up
there
sacré
but
there
is
nothing
real
about
religion
to
me
you
right
he
stifled
a
yawn
all
that
sort
of
thing
went
out
of
the
world
years
ago
thinking
people
are
religious
nowadays
it
does
give
them
enough
food
for
logical
thought
it
all
too
palpably
obvious
and
absurd
for
an
intelligent
person
to
bother
with
rather
a
strange
view
for
an
artist
my
friend
is
it
not
what
do
you
mean
thought
you
fellows
traded
on
the
beauty
of
faith
the
talk
of
priests
and
all
that
sort
of
thing
good
lord
no
his
voice
was
energetic
enough
now
he
was
becoming
interested
all
this
belief
in
god
and
man
and
the
innate
good
and
the
rest
of
it
is
tommyrot
that
what
it
is
and
the
soul
within
you
and
the
teachings
of
christ
he
paused
to
regain
his
breath
we
know
those
things
all
right
enough
if
they
were
real
we
see
them
would
we
if
they
were
real
they
happen
they
could
help
but
happen
every
day
but
they
do
and
so
they
just
talked
about
i
tell
you
if
there
were
such
things
we
know
it
yes
yes
surely
we
would
see
it
some
time
i
have
had
more
than
the
average
university
education
he
went
on
but
i
seen
men
and
women
and
i
know
that
some
of
them
are
bad
and
some
of
them
are
good
and
that
all
there
is
to
it
if
a
man
wants
to
be
a
liar
he
lie
what
going
to
make
him
tell
the
truth
i
like
to
know
it
does
sound
like
artistic
idealism
this
talk
of
yours
what
do
i
care
for
any
kind
of
idealism
there
too
much
of
the
poppycock
too
many
of
those
donkeys
playing
the
miniature
creator
for
my
taste
lord
but
i
like
to
see
an
army
of
them
in
the
field
you
speak
like
a
soldier
my
friend
i
proud
sir
of
being
a
soldier
in
a
flash
he
realized
what
he
had
said
beneath
his
breath
he
cursed
furiously
never
before
had
he
been
guilty
of
such
blatant
stupidity
a
sudden
anger
welled
within
him
against
this
man
who
had
caught
him
in
his
lie
yet
the
man
seemed
harmless
and
indifferent
enough
perhaps
he
could
still
get
out
of
it
what
in
the
name
of
heaven
had
drawn
the
truth
from
him
he
glanced
up
at
the
crucifix
and
his
cursing
abruptly
stopped
he
fell
to
wondering
if
he
had
better
strike
out
again
in
the
dark
he
could
tell
who
the
man
was
and
he
had
the
papers
to
guard
dawn
was
a
long
way
off
he
wondered
if
he
ought
to
chance
it
see
here
the
man
voice
caught
in
on
his
train
of
thought
i
know
what
going
through
your
head
you
did
want
me
to
know
that
you
were
a
soldier
i
was
going
to
tell
you
either
but
i
one
too
only
i
not
one
of
them
not
one
of
that
canaille
you
not
either
i
knew
the
minute
i
heard
you
speak
and
see
here
i
pretended
at
first
that
i
did
want
to
talk
but
it
true
i
was
starving
for
a
word
with
one
of
my
own
kind
i
told
you
i
was
comfortable
did
i
i
told
you
i
was
asleep
well
i
lied
been
writhing
here
for
hours
i
in
agony
my
leg
shot
off
what
they
did
to
me
i
been
lying
in
this
place
for
a
day
and
a
half
a
peasant
stopped
to
pray
here
he
gave
me
some
water
but
he
was
afraid
to
touch
me
a
sob
vibrated
hoarsely
in
the
man
throat
my
brother
i
want
your
hand
without
hesitation
he
put
out
his
hand
his
fingers
fumbling
over
the
hard
earth
until
at
last
they
found
and
grasped
the
man
hand
is
there
anything
i
can
do
he
asked
no
it
too
dark
we
must
wait
for
the
dawn
then
if
you
help
me
along
the
road
a
bit
his
voice
trailed
off
into
silence
so
they
sat
there
there
some
one
coming
he
said
he
felt
the
man
try
to
struggle
to
a
sitting
position
no
use
he
moaned
i
could
see
through
the
dark
anyway
sacré
did
i
try
it
before
when
you
came
along
breathlessly
they
waited
there
was
nothing
pleasant
about
this
meeting
people
one
could
see
it
was
just
luck
that
the
man
beside
him
been
one
of
them
he
wondered
if
the
approaching
person
would
stop
before
the
crucifix
or
would
go
on
the
footsteps
came
nearer
and
nearer
louder
and
louder
they
grew
until
the
sound
of
them
echoed
clatteringly
through
the
silence
of
the
night
then
sudden
deafening
stillness
as
yet
he
could
make
out
no
form
he
wondered
what
was
happening
slowly
he
realized
that
the
mass
of
the
crucifix
had
been
seen
and
that
the
feet
were
coming
toward
it
a
long
half
minute
and
then
something
soft
and
cold
brushed
his
cheek
a
quick
cry
a
woman
had
reached
him
with
her
outstretched
hands
her
fingers
had
touched
his
face
mon
dieu
she
whispered
then
i
am
not
alone
mon
dieu
who
are
you
he
answered
her
i
lost
my
way
i
waiting
for
the
dawn
you
will
not
hurt
me
her
whimpered
words
betrayed
her
fear
you
will
let
me
stay
to
wait
the
daylight
with
you
that
makes
three
of
us
he
said
waiting
for
morning
non
non
how
is
it
then
three
my
brother
here
you
and
i
mon
dieu
such
a
darkness
tell
me
it
is
a
sign
of
luck
is
it
not
to
meet
with
two
brothers
well
his
tone
was
apologetic
we
not
just
he
hesitated
ah
she
breathed
softly
is
it
as
the
curé
says
brotherhood
of
man
he
could
not
explain
to
himself
why
he
should
so
resent
her
comparing
him
to
her
priest
it
is
a
brotherhood
of
understanding
he
said
it
is
because
we
are
friends
friends
she
questioned
of
course
he
stated
emphatically
and
at
the
same
time
he
wondered
at
his
own
vehemence
why
should
he
call
this
man
whom
he
could
not
even
see
his
friend
surely
you
do
not
think
that
i
could
sit
here
in
the
dark
holding
my
enemy
by
the
hand
but
no
she
muttered
as
though
to
herself
no
hands
are
given
in
this
time
of
war
no
hands
but
the
hands
of
hate
for
the
first
time
the
man
spoke
hate
has
made
men
of
us
sacré
but
is
there
anything
greater
than
hate
mon
dieu
it
is
all
so
cruel
this
hate
that
has
crippled
our
men
look
you
you
two
brothers
i
would
avenge
them
as
you
avenge
them
but
voilà
there
is
so
little
so
pitifully
little
that
i
can
do
will
you
sit
beside
me
the
man
asked
gently
i
move
if
i
could
but
they
shot
off
my
leg
and
moving
is
easy
the
barbarians
have
caught
you
too
she
sank
to
her
knees
beside
them
how
i
loathe
them
ah
how
i
detest
them
they
burned
my
home
they
drove
me
out
of
chalet
corneille
my
father
and
my
mother
and
i
we
fled
by
the
light
of
our
flaming
i
thought
that
bad
but
it
was
the
worst
that
came
when
they
took
me
away
with
them
what
i
have
been
through
it
is
as
if
i
had
suffered
and
suffered
and
now
there
is
nothing
left
me
to
feel
but
hatred
and
i
been
back
there
thinking
my
people
might
come
for
me
mais
they
never
came
and
so
i
must
go
on
i
an
aunt
in
charvel
there
just
a
chance
but
even
if
i
do
find
a
home
i
still
hate
those
soldiers
i
kill
them
if
i
could
i
pray
to
christ
that
some
day
i
may
kill
to
avenge
is
that
what
you
here
for
i
here
to
await
the
dawn
madame
is
religious
the
sisters
and
the
curé
were
my
only
teachers
and
now
before
the
crucifix
madame
prays
christ
for
the
power
to
kill
non
non
her
voice
rose
shrilly
there
is
no
christ
here
on
this
cross
the
canaille
pulled
him
down
and
dragged
him
away
in
the
dirt
when
they
passed
there
were
peasants
who
begged
them
to
leave
the
figure
but
they
left
only
the
cross
and
once
three
days
after
they
had
defiled
it
i
saw
a
spy
crucified
there
i
helped
cut
him
down
now
it
empty
sacré
it
is
like
them
the
man
said
i
wondered
why
the
cross
was
bare
i
not
one
of
your
believers
but
i
can
see
how
it
would
hurt
a
good
woman
like
you
a
good
woman
she
questioned
vaguely
as
if
in
her
innocence
all
were
good
mon
dieu
i
only
know
that
it
hurt
he
looked
up
at
the
crucifix
the
sky
was
slowly
very
slowly
lightening
it
will
soon
be
day
he
said
they
were
silent
and
in
the
stillness
they
could
feel
the
expectancy
of
dawn
the
terse
waiting
for
the
light
the
eager
anticipating
stare
of
each
was
fixed
upon
the
other
face
the
black
of
the
sky
merged
very
gradually
into
a
pale
sickly
gray
far
to
the
east
quivered
a
thin
streak
of
yellow
light
the
three
drab
shadows
of
them
cowered
beneath
the
cross
mauve
and
pink
and
golden
light
spread
slowly
over
the
firmament
no
it
ca
be
he
muttered
his
eyes
upon
the
man
face
this
man
whom
he
had
sat
with
those
long
hours
before
the
dawn
whose
hand
he
still
held
in
his
he
thought
he
caught
the
man
whispered
sacré
the
woman
was
the
first
to
speak
voilà
she
taunted
but
it
is
oh
so
pretty
a
french
soldier
with
a
leg
shot
off
and
a
german
officer
to
nurse
him
you
two
you
who
spoke
of
hate
do
you
still
sit
hand
in
hand
the
girl
from
chalet
corneille
he
had
known
he
would
not
forget
her
face
the
dark
has
made
cowards
of
you
she
mocked
before
the
morning
you
clung
together
but
now
it
is
dawn
her
voice
rang
out
bitterly
brutally
clear
did
not
one
of
you
ask
there
anything
greater
than
hate
sacré
what
you
say
is
just
the
wounded
man
eyes
were
raised
to
glance
at
the
firmament
slowly
the
eyes
caught
the
sight
of
something
else
very
gradually
they
took
in
that
unexpected
thing
mechanically
the
words
were
jerked
out
it
was
i
who
asked
a
sudden
pause
a
quick
gasp
god
forgive
me
it
was
i
the
uncanniness
of
the
words
shocked
him
in
spite
of
himself
his
own
eyes
followed
the
man
wide
stare
followed
it
from
the
eastern
horizon
over
the
shimmering
sky
followed
it
until
he
reached
the
crucifix
the
hand
which
at
the
girl
words
had
sought
his
pistol
shook
now
as
he
crossed
himself
was
it
the
smudging
shadows
the
still
unlighted
mass
of
them
up
there
on
the
arms
of
the
crucifix
would
shadows
take
on
so
the
semblance
of
the
human
body
if
there
were
such
things
we
know
it
fragments
of
their
talk
in
the
night
came
vividly
back
to
him
if
these
things
were
real
sometimes
we
see
it
the
girl
dropped
to
her
knees
her
hands
were
clinched
over
her
heaving
breast
her
gaze
riveted
itself
upon
that
mass
of
shadows
high
up
on
the
cross
that
mass
of
shadows
so
mysteriously
like
the
dimly
defined
christ
figure
with
a
hoarse
racking
sob
that
shook
his
whole
frame
the
wounded
soldier
fell
upon
his
face
quickly
the
officer
bent
over
him
his
hand
on
the
shaking
shoulder
his
breath
coming
and
going
in
short
rasping
gasps
motionless
he
stood
there
moving
only
to
catch
hold
of
the
girl
fingers
that
reached
up
and
clung
to
his
the
faint
cold
light
of
early
morning
tinged
across
the
of
the
sky
daybreak
lighted
the
three
grouped
figures
huddled
so
close
together
beneath
the
crucifix
dawn
showed
clearly
the
brown
wooden
cross
and
the
great
out
nails
that
had
once
held
the
christ
the
stillness
he
cringed
in
shuddering
awe
beneath
the
stillness
he
could
not
stand
the
heavy
deep
silence
of
it
the
muffled
sucking
thickness
absorbing
so
completely
all
sound
into
its
deadening
mat
he
had
gotten
so
that
he
had
to
be
perpetually
stopping
himself
from
screaming
he
had
to
keep
watch
on
himself
always
he
was
terrified
that
he
might
go
mad
he
feared
the
oppression
of
the
awful
quiet
would
craftily
draw
his
reason
away
from
him
he
did
not
want
to
scream
he
did
not
want
to
attempt
to
defy
the
harrowing
rending
silence
he
was
afraid
of
the
blanketing
saturating
weight
of
the
stillness
sometimes
when
he
could
bring
himself
to
think
he
thought
that
he
might
after
all
like
to
go
about
shouting
at
the
top
of
his
lungs
his
mind
kept
on
surreptitiously
toying
with
the
thought
of
the
relief
from
the
thing
he
thought
of
it
a
lot
he
knew
that
shouting
about
his
own
farm
would
not
do
him
any
good
he
was
too
far
away
from
everything
and
everyone
in
the
strip
of
valley
hemmed
in
between
the
rolling
hills
of
course
there
was
old
man
efferts
old
man
efferts
did
not
live
so
very
far
away
he
knew
he
could
not
count
on
efferts
efferts
had
lived
there
too
long
in
the
stillness
that
rolled
down
to
him
from
the
hills
and
came
together
to
lie
flat
and
sluggish
thudding
down
on
the
valley
land
if
he
could
bring
himself
to
walk
into
the
town
shouting
so
that
other
people
would
follow
after
him
shouting
so
that
there
would
be
some
kind
of
continuous
human
noise
for
a
while
it
was
that
he
wanted
more
than
anything
else
human
noise
at
night
he
would
wake
suddenly
from
his
heavy
quiet
slumber
from
the
dreamless
ponderous
pit
of
it
and
listen
to
the
stillness
when
he
first
went
to
bed
it
would
take
him
hours
before
he
could
get
himself
off
to
sleep
he
dreaded
the
muted
frantic
struggle
of
those
dragging
pulling
hours
in
which
he
would
try
to
shut
his
ears
to
the
soundless
deafening
silence
that
throbbed
noiselessly
from
a
great
distance
and
was
noiseless
in
the
room
all
about
him
and
pressed
noiselessly
against
his
blood
filled
he
had
the
feeling
at
night
that
the
stillness
became
more
real
sweeping
in
a
greater
rush
down
the
hills
that
it
had
an
heightened
insidious
power
to
get
inside
of
him
he
would
toss
about
on
his
narrow
wooden
bed
for
hours
moving
cautiously
and
carefully
so
as
not
to
do
anything
that
would
offend
the
drugged
burden
of
the
silence
he
would
move
a
leg
or
an
arm
slyly
and
then
he
would
lie
quite
quiet
for
a
time
holding
his
breath
until
the
cracking
pain
came
plunging
again
and
again
into
his
chest
he
could
feel
the
stillness
filling
in
all
the
spaces
and
crevices
around
him
so
that
he
thought
it
rose
and
swelled
hideously
he
was
afraid
of
those
hours
before
he
went
to
sleep
before
he
could
drop
off
with
that
overwhelming
sense
that
in
losing
consciousness
he
was
consciously
letting
himself
drown
in
a
tremendous
swollen
wave
of
silence
and
then
toward
morning
that
sudden
inevitable
awakening
his
rousing
himself
to
listen
his
whole
body
becoming
rigid
tautly
holding
itself
with
straining
shaking
muscles
to
the
position
in
which
he
lay
the
sweat
breaking
out
all
over
him
and
trickling
coldly
down
from
his
armpits
along
his
sides
his
cunning
shifting
of
his
head
so
that
he
could
clear
his
ears
to
hear
better
his
futile
harkening
for
the
sound
that
never
came
his
intensive
shivering
waiting
for
it
and
nothing
but
the
stillness
he
could
never
make
himself
move
the
thing
was
so
actual
suffocatingly
potent
malignant
he
had
grown
terrified
of
attempting
to
disrupt
it
in
any
of
those
little
ways
at
his
command
he
had
begun
to
think
that
the
noise
he
would
make
would
not
be
a
noise
he
could
not
have
stood
the
shock
of
making
a
noise
that
would
be
quite
vacantly
without
sound
all
day
long
working
in
his
fields
he
used
to
wonder
at
it
in
the
sunlight
it
was
with
him
still
and
bated
it
rose
up
to
him
from
the
ground
at
his
feet
from
the
soil
it
had
wormed
itself
into
it
crushed
down
on
him
from
the
clear
blue
sweep
of
the
sky
it
spread
unseen
toward
him
down
the
long
uncertain
slopes
of
the
hills
coming
on
always
from
all
sides
and
staying
it
had
become
so
that
nothing
was
real
to
him
nothing
but
the
stillness
that
drenched
everything
stifling
and
choking
the
old
mare
working
her
way
in
front
of
the
plow
along
the
narrowed
deepening
furrows
was
a
ghost
creature
to
him
the
grayness
of
her
blurred
ahead
of
him
in
the
brightest
stream
of
sunlight
her
foolish
stilly
gliding
played
horridly
on
his
raw
nerves
at
all
times
she
was
a
phantom
animal
stirring
with
the
intangible
motion
of
the
silence
he
felt
that
she
did
not
belong
to
him
that
she
was
a
thing
of
the
stillness
he
would
trail
after
her
his
quivering
thin
hands
on
the
plow
handles
his
eyes
riveted
on
her
bony
withers
he
would
try
to
concentrate
his
thoughts
on
the
way
she
moved
and
then
overcome
quite
suddenly
with
the
quiet
insidious
stealth
of
her
ambling
he
would
pull
her
up
and
stop
to
mop
his
forehead
his
eyes
going
slowly
around
him
as
if
he
almost
expected
to
see
the
thing
that
had
lain
that
smothering
strangling
hold
on
to
him
his
one
and
only
companion
was
a
yellow
mongrel
that
had
come
slinking
in
at
the
farm
gate
its
tail
drooping
between
its
legs
he
had
been
glad
at
first
of
having
the
dog
with
him
and
then
gradually
he
had
come
to
feel
the
oddness
of
the
animal
if
he
could
have
done
so
he
would
have
turned
the
dog
out
again
into
the
stillness
from
which
it
had
come
to
him
he
was
sure
that
the
mongrel
must
be
old
unnaturally
old
he
could
not
understand
the
dog
awful
quiet
in
his
heart
he
was
scared
of
the
dog
the
mongrel
followed
incessantly
at
his
heels
always
with
dragging
tail
whenever
his
eyes
turned
behind
him
they
met
the
mongrel
eyes
that
were
fixed
on
him
the
eyes
that
were
filled
with
that
uncanny
beaten
look
as
if
it
had
been
horridly
cowed
there
was
an
age
of
agony
in
the
dog
eyes
as
the
days
went
on
he
became
more
and
more
afraid
of
the
mongrel
eyes
he
had
come
out
to
the
farm
to
start
with
because
of
the
silence
he
had
felt
that
he
would
have
to
get
away
from
the
noise
and
the
tumultuous
uproar
of
the
city
after
what
he
had
done
he
could
not
stand
it
he
had
gotten
away
he
thought
now
that
his
mind
would
snap
that
it
would
break
from
under
the
lull
which
had
come
into
it
the
lull
which
devastated
him
with
its
hushed
brutality
he
had
never
been
fond
of
people
even
in
those
days
back
there
in
the
city
before
he
had
done
the
thing
that
was
wrong
he
had
mistrusted
them
and
after
it
he
had
run
from
them
run
wildly
and
unthinkingly
to
cover
with
the
fear
of
them
coming
on
behind
him
the
deathly
lonely
farm
was
to
him
at
that
time
a
haven
of
rest
he
had
made
up
his
mind
to
live
on
the
farm
until
the
end
of
his
life
he
used
to
think
bitterly
of
his
waiting
so
patiently
for
his
death
when
he
could
think
of
anything
other
than
the
silence
he
thought
of
his
dying
of
life
being
squeezed
out
of
him
by
the
shrouded
quiet
sometimes
he
would
wonder
if
it
were
death
that
ominously
waited
for
him
in
that
appalling
threatening
stillness
there
had
been
days
when
he
had
tried
to
recall
the
sound
of
voices
he
had
known
he
had
spent
long
hours
in
awakening
in
his
memory
those
voices
he
had
wanted
particularly
to
think
of
people
laughing
he
used
to
want
to
get
the
pitch
of
their
laughing
to
surround
himself
with
the
vibration
of
reiterated
laughter
and
then
when
he
had
gotten
it
so
that
he
almost
heard
it
so
that
he
felt
that
with
concentrated
attention
he
might
hear
the
laughing
he
would
find
himself
listening
to
the
frightful
numbing
stillness
he
had
not
the
courage
to
go
on
trying
that
following
the
plow
and
the
old
gray
mare
through
the
fields
with
the
dog
skulking
abjectly
at
his
heels
he
would
think
of
that
thing
which
he
had
done
that
had
ostracized
him
from
the
rest
of
humanity
he
never
thought
of
the
possibility
of
making
his
life
over
again
he
could
not
have
thought
of
it
if
he
had
wanted
to
it
was
all
too
hopeless
too
impossible
to
think
about
the
deadening
quiet
in
which
he
had
been
steeped
had
drained
him
sapped
from
him
all
initiative
when
evening
came
he
would
go
into
his
shack
and
close
the
door
he
would
light
the
oil
lamp
on
the
old
table
that
stood
in
the
center
of
the
room
and
he
would
go
about
getting
supper
for
himself
and
the
mongrel
he
took
great
care
always
to
move
his
pots
and
pans
gently
if
he
picked
up
a
plate
he
did
it
slowly
softly
when
he
put
his
bowl
of
food
on
the
table
he
slid
it
consciously
onto
the
surface
without
noise
and
going
to
and
fro
not
oftener
than
he
had
to
his
feet
in
their
padded
moccasins
lifted
him
to
his
toes
he
ate
quietly
and
quickly
swallowing
his
food
without
chewing
feeding
himself
and
the
dog
with
his
fingers
and
all
the
while
feeling
that
the
stillness
was
rushing
down
from
the
hills
and
gathering
to
greater
force
about
him
and
when
he
was
quite
finished
with
the
clearing
away
of
his
dishes
he
would
sit
beside
the
table
the
mongrel
in
front
of
him
and
he
would
think
frantically
of
the
relief
of
talking
his
lips
would
begin
to
quiver
hideously
to
move
that
hoarse
inhuman
muttering
that
had
no
sound
of
voice
in
it
would
start
and
then
he
would
see
the
dog
eyes
filled
with
that
horrid
beaten
look
fixed
on
his
mouth
and
he
would
stop
gasping
once
every
little
while
old
man
efferts
would
come
down
to
the
shack
in
the
valley
he
knew
nothing
of
old
man
efferts
other
than
that
ever
since
he
had
come
to
live
at
the
farm
efferts
had
stopped
in
for
an
evening
now
and
again
at
first
he
had
resented
old
man
efferts
coming
later
when
he
had
seen
that
efferts
would
not
interfere
with
him
he
had
not
minded
so
much
he
had
become
quite
used
to
seeing
the
bent
huddled
figure
of
the
man
trailing
down
the
hillside
and
shambling
into
the
room
to
sit
there
opposite
to
him
quite
silent
of
late
he
had
gone
about
fetching
the
old
man
a
glass
of
cider
and
a
piece
of
bread
and
they
had
sat
facing
each
other
never
talking
just
sitting
rigidly
with
the
dog
on
the
floor
between
them
and
the
silence
spilling
itself
in
gigantic
floods
all
around
them
and
then
old
efferts
would
light
his
pipe
and
when
he
had
finished
it
he
would
get
up
and
go
out
of
the
door
and
after
he
had
watched
old
man
efferts
go
with
the
feeling
that
he
might
not
be
real
he
would
stumble
up
to
his
room
to
lie
in
the
narrow
wooden
bed
trying
to
shut
his
ears
to
the
deafening
silence
about
him
cringing
between
his
blankets
as
the
swell
of
it
heightened
insidiously
he
knew
that
the
stillness
had
swamped
itself
into
old
man
efferts
he
could
see
the
stamp
of
it
in
the
uncertain
stupefied
face
in
the
bewildered
eyes
that
had
behind
them
something
of
the
look
that
stayed
on
in
the
dog
eyes
in
the
mouth
that
drooled
at
the
corners
in
the
old
man
still
quiet
way
of
moving
the
unreal
phantom
way
in
which
the
gray
mare
moved
he
did
not
know
why
the
old
man
should
come
to
him
to
sit
so
dumbly
opposite
him
for
a
whole
evening
he
did
not
care
he
was
long
past
caring
there
were
times
when
he
thought
he
might
tell
old
man
efferts
of
that
thing
which
he
had
done
years
ago
and
which
had
isolated
him
from
his
fellows
not
that
he
thought
so
much
of
it
he
had
almost
forgotten
it
the
stillness
had
made
him
forget
everything
but
itself
had
pushed
everything
out
of
his
mind
before
its
own
spreading
weight
but
he
kept
the
thought
of
speaking
to
efferts
of
what
he
had
done
in
the
back
of
his
head
he
knew
how
his
telling
it
to
efferts
could
not
fail
to
act
he
knew
that
something
would
infallibly
happen
that
the
surprise
of
it
could
not
help
but
penetrate
the
thickness
of
efferts
silence
he
always
felt
soothing
himself
with
the
thought
of
relief
that
when
the
power
of
the
stillness
became
unbearable
he
would
shock
old
efferts
into
talk
there
were
moments
when
he
hungered
savagely
to
force
old
efferts
out
of
his
walling
quiet
moments
when
he
was
starving
for
the
comfort
of
human
sound
his
voice
and
efferts
voice
voices
that
would
rise
above
the
stillness
voices
that
would
penetrate
cunningly
through
the
quiet
voices
that
would
speak
and
answer
each
other
he
was
sitting
in
the
center
of
his
lamp
lit
room
he
had
had
his
supper
and
had
cleared
away
the
dishes
with
his
usual
crafty
carefulness
he
had
lighted
his
pipe
he
sat
in
the
chair
beside
the
table
his
body
quite
rigid
his
arms
and
legs
stiffened
to
a
torturing
quiet
the
mongrel
crouched
at
his
feet
there
was
something
strange
in
the
way
the
animal
lay
in
its
tightened
muscles
that
pulled
and
twitched
as
it
breathed
whenever
he
looked
down
his
eyes
met
the
dog
eyes
outside
the
heavy
shadows
of
the
night
crept
along
the
ground
pushed
on
by
the
rushing
rising
silence
behind
them
he
knew
that
the
stillness
was
rolling
down
the
slope
of
those
long
hills
he
knew
that
its
awful
quiet
was
gathering
in
the
valley
he
knew
that
it
was
trickling
horridly
still
into
the
low
ceilinged
room
he
had
the
feeling
for
the
thousandth
time
that
the
most
minute
noise
was
swallowed
up
in
the
stillness
before
it
came
into
being
he
looked
up
then
to
see
the
door
shoved
warily
ajar
a
wrinkled
ugly
hand
showed
against
the
dark
wood
in
a
lighter
patch
of
brown
a
coarse
booted
foot
came
behind
the
swing
of
the
door
standing
against
the
black
of
the
night
he
saw
old
man
efferts
he
watched
the
old
man
come
into
the
room
he
saw
him
pull
up
a
chair
lifting
it
from
off
the
floor
and
setting
it
down
opposite
to
him
within
the
pooling
space
of
the
yellow
lamplight
he
stared
at
efferts
as
he
sank
into
the
chair
old
man
efferts
took
out
his
pipe
and
lit
it
he
kept
his
eyes
on
efferts
as
he
had
so
often
done
on
the
uncertain
stupefied
face
that
was
turned
to
him
on
the
bewildered
eyes
that
had
something
behind
them
of
the
look
that
stayed
on
in
the
dog
eyes
on
the
mouth
that
drooled
at
the
corners
he
got
up
then
and
went
on
his
toes
to
the
door
and
closed
it
softly
he
felt
that
efferts
eyes
were
on
him
and
the
mongrel
eyes
he
came
back
and
sat
down
in
his
chair
they
both
smoked
quietly
he
remembered
the
glass
of
cider
and
the
piece
of
bread
he
could
not
bring
himself
to
move
he
felt
the
suffocating
weight
of
the
stillness
crowding
past
him
it
was
expanding
menacingly
throughout
the
small
room
it
filled
in
all
about
him
presently
old
man
efferts
would
finish
his
pipe
and
would
get
up
and
shamble
out
of
the
door
he
would
sit
there
and
watch
him
go
as
he
always
watched
wondering
if
perhaps
old
man
efferts
was
not
real
and
then
he
would
stumble
up
to
bed
and
lie
awake
and
listen
to
the
stillness
that
grew
greater
and
greater
he
wanted
the
relief
from
that
silence
wanted
it
desperately
passionately
he
remembered
that
if
he
told
efferts
of
that
thing
that
he
had
come
so
near
forgetting
in
the
smothering
quiet
that
he
would
have
what
he
so
frantically
wanted
some
human
speech
human
talk
that
would
break
the
silence
even
for
a
little
while
the
sound
of
human
voices
that
would
rise
and
answer
each
other
he
glanced
at
the
old
man
surreptitiously
he
tried
to
think
what
expression
would
come
into
that
stupid
face
with
the
bewildered
eyes
he
tried
to
see
the
drooling
mouth
as
it
would
look
with
the
lips
of
it
startled
into
moving
he
sat
very
still
words
formed
themselves
lagging
into
his
mind
i
am
going
to
tell
he
would
start
to
say
it
to
old
man
efferts
that
way
he
could
not
stand
the
stillness
any
longer
anything
was
better
than
the
appalling
agony
of
the
quiet
he
made
a
little
tentative
movement
with
his
thin
shaking
hands
he
felt
that
efferts
was
staring
at
him
the
mongrel
crouching
at
his
feet
moved
stealthily
he
heard
no
sound
from
the
animal
moving
he
knew
it
had
gotten
to
its
feet
he
saw
it
standing
there
between
where
he
sat
and
where
efferts
sat
he
felt
his
lips
begin
to
quiver
i
am
going
to
he
got
the
words
into
his
head
again
through
the
menacing
waiting
stillness
he
muttered
something
old
man
efferts
leaned
forward
his
hand
behind
his
ear
in
a
sudden
blinding
flash
of
knowledge
he
realized
that
old
man
efferts
was
deaf
he
felt
his
mouth
twisting
around
his
face
he
tried
then
to
shout
his
eyes
avoided
the
mongrel
eyes
that
he
knew
were
filled
with
that
uncanny
beaten
look
and
were
fixed
on
his
jerking
grimacing
mouth
all
about
him
the
ominous
malignant
silence
he
tried
again
and
again
to
speak
he
could
not
talk
sweat
stood
out
in
great
glistening
beads
on
his
forehead
and
dribbled
blindingly
into
his
wide
distended
eyes
his
body
shook
with
the
stupendous
effort
he
was
making
his
tongue
was
swollen
he
could
feel
his
throat
tightening
so
that
it
hurt
he
could
not
get
his
words
into
that
hoarse
inhuman
muttering
that
had
no
sound
of
voice
in
it
he
kept
on
trying
and
trying
to
speak
he
saw
that
old
man
efferts
had
finished
his
pipe
he
watched
him
get
out
of
his
chair
and
go
shambling
across
the
room
and
through
the
door
he
sat
there
his
hands
went
up
to
his
working
mouth
he
wanted
to
hide
the
hideous
jerking
of
it
his
eyes
met
the
mongrel
eyes
the
stillness
grew
appalling
