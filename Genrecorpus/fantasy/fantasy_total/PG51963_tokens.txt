other
world
is
indeed
not
so
far
distant
from
our
own
that
is
ruled
by
the
sunne
and
moon
therein
the
prince
of
the
power
of
the
air
hath
his
dominion
whose
servants
are
the
witch
and
the
warlock
the
night

some
for
want
of
a

also
the

goblin
himself
a
foul
fiend
albeit
full
of
pranks
lyars
all
but
dangerous
to
trajfick
with
and
very
treacherous
to
mankind
they
lure
to
perdition
soone
or
a
providential
escape
the
majority
of
the
passengers
aboard
the
steam
yacht
said
that
it
was
anybody
s
game
in
the
when
neither
somers
nor
norgate
was
present
of
course
the
betting
varied
daily
according
to
the
events
of
the
day
at
first
the
odds
were
slightly
in
favour
of
teddy
somers
yes
she
undoubtedly
gave
signs
of
enjoying
the
companionship
of
mr
somers
she
had
been
seen
by
trustworthy
witnesses
standing
behind
him
while
he
sketched
with
a
rapid
pencil
the
group
of
portuguese
boatmen
surrounding
the
solitary
scotchman
who
had
got
the
better
of
them
all
in
a
bargain
within
the
first
hour
of
the
arrival
of
the
yacht
in
funchal
bay
afterwards
she
had
been
noticed
carefully
gumming
the
drawing
upon
a
cardboard
mount
would
a
girl
take
all
that
trouble
about
a
man
unless
she
had
a
sincere
regard
for
him
was
the
question
which
a
sapient
one
put
to
a
section
of
his
fellow
passengers
accompanying
an
offer
of
three
to
one
on
somers
but
after
a
pause
which
somehow
seemed
to
suggest
an
aggregation
of
thought
the
pauses
of
a
conscientious
smoker
are
frequently
fraught
with
suggestions
a
youth
who
had
been
accused
of
writing
poetry
but
whose
excellent
cigars
did
much
to
allay
that
suspicion
remarked
what
you
say
about
the
drawing
suggests
that
the
girl
takes
an
interest
in
him
and
that
would
be
fatal
to
her
falling
in
love
with
there
was
another
long
pause
during
which
the
smokers
looked
at
one
another
carefully
refraining
from
glancing
at
the
speaker
until
the
man
who
had
offered
the
odds
said
do
you
mean
to
tell
us
that
a
girl
s
being
interested
in
a
chap
isn
t
the
first
step
to
her
falling
in
love
with
him
i
have
no
hesitation
in
saying
so
much
i
could
say
a
good
deal
more
on
the
same
subject
replied
the
propounder
of
the
theory
then
it
was
that
a
number
of
the
men
glanced
quickly
toward
him
there
was
something
of
an
appeal
for
mercy
in
the
glance
of
most
of
them
it
seemed
as
if
they
were
not
particularly
anxious
to
hear
a
good
deal
more
on
the
same
subject
it
is
scarcely
necessary
to
say
however
that
the
circumstance
of
their
not
wanting
to
hear
a
good
deal
more
did
not
prevent
the
poet
alleged
from
telling
them
a
good
deal
more
it
took
him
minutes
to
formulate
his
theory
which
was
to
the
effect
that
it
is
impossible
impossible
was
the
word
he
employed
there
is
no
spirit
of
compromise
on
the
part
of
a
theorist
especially
when
he
is
young
and
more
especially
when
he
has
been
suspected
of
writing
poetry
for
a
woman
to
love
a
man
who
has
at
first
merely
interested
her
love
is
a
passion
whereas
interest
is
well
interest
is
merely
interest
said
he
with
that
air
of
finality
which
a
youthful
theorist
assumes
when
he
is
particularly
absurd
and
knows
it
yes
when
a
woman
hates
a
man
thoroughly
and
for
the
best
of
reasons
though
for
that
matter
she
may
hate
him
thoroughly
without
having
any
reason
for
it
she
is
nearer
to
loving
him
thoroughly
than
she
is
to
loving
a
man
who
merely
interests
her
however
deep
may
be
the
interest
which
he
i
ll
give
three
to
one
in
sovereigns
on
somers
said
the
man
who
had
originally
offered
the
same
odds
he
was
clearly
not
amenable
to
the
dictates
of
reason
the
theorist
said
he
certainly
was
not
amenable
to
the
dictates
of
a
theory
which
however
is
not
exactly
the
same
thing
it
s
anybody
s
game
just
now
remarked
another
of
the
sapient
ones
anybody
s
except
the
man
s
in
whom
she
has
become
interested
said
the
theorist
my
dear
young
man
said
the
professional
cynic
he
had
scarcely
recovered
from
a
severe
attack
of
de
my
dear
young
man
you
re
not
a
very
much
greater
ass
than
most
boys
of
your
age
but
you
will
really
not
strike
people
as
being
much
below
the
average
if
you
only
refrain
from
formulating
any
theory
respecting
any
woman
the
only
thing
that
it
is
safe
to
say
about
a
woman
any
woman
every
woman
is
that
no
human
being
knows
what
she
will
do
yes
but
we
were
not
talking
about
what
a
woman
will
do
next
but
what
she
will
do
first
said
the
poet
who
was
not
easily
crushed
now
i
say
that
she
oh
do
dry
up
shouted
a
smoking
man
in
a
corner
who
had
just
rung
for
a
i
ve
heard
more
nonsense
within
the
past
than
i
ever
heard
during
an
entire
year
of
my
life
there
is
no
sense
in
arguing
but
there
is
some
sense
in
betting
if
you
believe
in
your
theory
back
it
with
a
sovereign
to
show
that
you
re
in
but
the
young
man
s
theory
did
not
run
into
coin
though
in
other
directions
three
to
one
on
teddy
somers
was
officially
reported
as
offered
and
taken
two
days
afterwards
the
layer
of
the
odds
tried
to
hedge
the
fact
was
that
the
girl
had
shown
such
a
marked
inclination
for
the
society
of
jack
norgate
in
preference
to
that
of
teddy
somers
it
seemed
as
if
the
former
would
to
make
use
of
an
apt
phrase
romp
in
but
before
the
steam
yacht
had
crossed
the
equator
the
odds
were
even
as
a
passenger
named
molloy
he
was
reputed
to
be
of
irish
descent
remarked
it
was
a
pleasant
company
that
had
left
gravesend
on
september
for
the
six
months
cruise
to
cheat
the
winter
see
advertisements
in
the
steam
yacht
tons
captain
grosvenor
in
command
the
passengers
numbered
sixty
and
included
singularly
few
disagreeable
persons
in
spite
of
the
fact
that
the
voyage
was
one
that
only
people
with
money
and
leisure
could
afford
the
vessel
was
well
found
and
her
commander
and
officers
were
the
pick
of
the
company
s
fleet
and
possessed
innumerable
resources
in
the
way
of
deck
games
the
report
found
ready
credence
in
the
service
that
captain
grosvenor
had
gained
his
position
through
being
the
originator
of
however
this
may
be
he
certainly
recognised
in
the
amplest
way
the
responsibilities
of
the
position
of
trust
which
he
occupied
and
he
never
allowed
any
duty
to
interfere
with
his
daily
exposition
of
the
splendid
possibilities
of
he
had
started
a
golf
tournament
before
the
yacht
had
left
the
channel
and
he
hove
to
for
three
days
in
the
bay
of
biscay
when
the
heavy
sea
that
was
running
threatened
to
interfere
with
the
playing
off
of
the
tie
between
colonel
mydleton
and
sir
edwin
everard
the
cruise
promised
to
be
all
that
the
advertisements
had
predicted
it
would
be
but
before
madeira
was
reached
comments
were
made
upon
the
extraordinary
scarcity
of
young
girls
among
the
passengers
among
a
certain
section
of
the
passengers
the
comments
on
this
point
had
a
highly
congratulatory
tone
but
among
another
section
the
matter
was
touched
upon
with
a
considerable
amount
of
grumbling
old
voyagers
who
were
accompanied
by
vigilant
wives
their
own
foresaw
a
tranquil
voyage
undisturbed
by
those
complications
which
their
experience
told
them
invariably
arise
when
attractive
young
women
are
to
be
found
in
graceful
attitudes
on
deck
chairs
on
the
other
hand
however
there
were
several
men
aboard
who
had
just
sufficient
experience
of
going
down
to
the
sea
in
steam
yachts
to
cause
them
to
look
askance
during
their
first
day
aboard
over
the
deck
chairs
which
were
occupied
mainly
by
fathers
and
matrons
yes
there
was
undoubtedly
a
scarcity
of
girls
the
fact
is
that
such
a
pleasure
cruise
as
that
which
had
been
mapped
out
for
the
differs
essentially
from
the
ordinary
indian
or
australian
voyage
on
the
two
girls
are
to
be
found
by
the
score
going
out
or
returning
it
is
not
a
matter
of
pleasure
with
them
though
most
of
them
contrive
to
get
a
good
deal
of
pleasure
out
of
it
but
a
matter
of
necessity
the
majority
of
people
who
set
out
on
a
cruise
in
a
steam
yacht
do
so
only
because
time
hangs
heavy
on
their
hands
and
they
do
not
take
their
daughters
with
them
for
the
simple
reason
that
their
daughters
decline
to
expatriate
themselves
for
six
or
eight
months
at
the
most
critical
period
of
their
lives
only
six
young
women
were
among
the
passengers
of
the
of
these
only
three
were
quite
and
of
these
three
the
only
really
beautiful
one
was
viola
compton
it
did
not
take
the
experienced
voyagers
long
to
perceive
that
miss
compton
would
have
an
extremely
good
time
aboard
the
yacht
with
all
their
experience
they
knew
no
better
than
to
suppose
that
a
girl
is
having
a
good
time
when
she
has
half
a
dozen
men
at
her
feet
and
a
reserve
force
of
twenty
others
ready
to
prostrate
themselves
before
her
at
a
moment
s
notice
when
she
is
sneered
at
by
her
less
pretty
sisters
who
tell
one
another
that
she
gives
herself
insufferable
airs
when
she
is
frowned
at
by
the
wives
of
uncertain
husbands
who
call
her
among
themselves
a
forward
minx
and
when
she
can
not
snub
the
most
odious
of
the
men
who
disarrange
her
cushions
for
her
and
prevent
her
from
reading
her
novels
by
insisting
on
chatting
to
her
on
all
the
inanities
which
a
long
voyage
fosters
in
men
who
on
shore
are
alluded
to
as
if
to
be
in
such
a
position
is
to
be
having
a
good
time
viola
had
certainly
the
best
time
on
record
even
before
the
yacht
had
crossed
the
line
she
had
about
a
score
of
men
around
her
who
never
allowed
her
to
have
a
moment
to
herself
she
was
bored
by
colonel
mydleton
s
story
of
lord
roberts
mistakes
when
in
india
the
crowning
one
being
according
to
colonel
mydleton
the
march
to
kandahar
which
he
assured
her
was
one
of
the
greatest
fiascos
of
the
century
she
was
rendered
uncomfortable
for
a
whole
afternoon
of
exquisite
sunshine
by
the
proximity
of
the
poet
who
insisted
on
repeating
to
her
a
volume
of
lyrics
that
only
awaited
a
publisher
she
was
awakened
from
a
delightful
doze
after
tiffin
by
the
commonplace
jests
of
the
young
man
who
fondly
believed
himself
to
be
a
humourist
she
was
sneered
at
by
the
other
girls
and
frowned
upon
by
the
matrons
and
she
was
made
the
subject
of
bets
in
the
in
short
she
was
having
most
people
agreed
an
uncommonly
good
time
aboard
the
captain
knew
better
however
he
had
kept
his
eyes
open
during
a
lifetime
of
voyages
on
passenger
steamers
and
he
could
see
a
good
deal
with
his
eyes
without
the
aid
of
a
binocular
telescope
there
could
be
no
doubt
that
miss
compton
treated
both
teddy
somers
and
jack
norgate
with
a
favour
which
she
could
not
see
her
way
to
extend
to
the
other
passengers
it
was
only
natural
that
she
should
do
so
the
captain
saw
at
once
though
he
was
too
experienced
to
say
so
even
to
his
chief
engineer
who
was
a
scotchman
norgate
and
somers
were
both
nice
chaps
and
had
won
distinction
for
themselves
in
the
world
the
former
was
a
mighty
hunter
and
had
slain
lions
in
the
region
of
the
zambesi
and
bears
in
the
rockies
the
latter
was
well
known
as
an
artist
he
was
something
of
a
musician
as
well
and
he
had
once
had
a
play
produced
which
had
taken
a
very
respectable
position
amongst
the
failures
of
the
season
both
men
were
very
well
off
the
one
could
afford
to
be
a
hunter
and
the
other
could
even
afford
to
be
an
artist
they
were
both
clearly
devoted
to
viola
but
this
fact
did
not
seem
to
interfere
with
the
friendship
which
existed
between
them
neither
of
the
two
tried
to
cut
out
the
other
so
far
as
the
girl
was
concerned
when
somers
was
sitting
by
her
side
norgate
kept
apart
from
them
and
when
norgate
chanced
to
find
himself
with
her
his
friend
although
the
tropical
moonlight
was
flooding
the
heaven
continued
his
smoking
on
the
bridge
with
the
captain
the
captain
was
lost
in
admiration
of
both
men
he
reserved
some
for
the
girl
however
he
acknowledged
that
she
was
behaving
very
well
indeed
that
is
of
course
for
the
only
really
pretty
girl
aboard
a
ship
the
captain
was
a
strong
believer
in
the
advantages
of
a
healthy
competition
between
young
women
the
tyranny
of
the
monopolist
had
frequently
come
within
his
range
of
vision
yes
he
saw
that
miss
compton
was
behaving
discreetly
she
did
not
seek
to
play
off
one
man
against
the
other
nor
did
she
make
the
attempt
to
play
off
a
third
man
against
both
for
his
own
part
he
utterly
failed
in
his
attempt
to
find
out
in
what
direction
her
affections
tended
he
saw
that
the
girl
liked
both
men
but
he
did
not
know
which
of
them
she
loved
assuming
that
she
actually
did
love
one
of
them
he
wondered
if
the
girl
herself
knew
he
was
strongly
inclined
to
believe
that
she
did
not
but
that
was
just
where
he
made
a
mistake
she
did
know
and
she
communicated
her
knowledge
to
teddy
somers
one
night
when
they
stood
together
watching
the
marvellous
phosphorescence
of
the
south
atlantic
within
ten
days
sail
of
the
cape
a
concert
was
going
on
in
the
great
saloon
so
that
there
was
an
appropriate
musical
background
so
to
speak
for
their
conversation
teddy
had
said
something
to
her
that
forced
from
her
an
involuntary
cry
or
was
it
a
sigh
then
there
was
a
pause
with
appropriate
music
it
came
from
a
banjo
in
the
saloon
is
that
your
answer
he
inquired
laying
one
of
his
hands
upon
hers
as
it
lay
on
the
brass
plating
of
the
bulwarks
my
answer
she
said
i
m
so
sorry
so
very
sorry
mr
sorry
why
should
you
be
sorry
he
said
softly
i
tell
you
that
i
love
you
with
all
ah
do
not
say
it
again
for
pity
s
sake
do
not
say
it
again
she
cried
almost
piteously
you
must
never
speak
to
me
of
love
i
have
promised
to
love
only
jack
mr
what
you
have
promised
you
have
it
only
happened
after
tiffin
i
thought
perhaps
he
might
have
told
you
i
thought
perhaps
you
noticed
that
he
and
i
oh
yes
you
certainly
behaved
as
if
you
took
it
for
granted
that
ah
i
am
so
sorry
that
you
misunderstood
i
think
that
i
must
have
loved
him
from
the
there
was
another
long
pause
he
looked
down
into
the
gleaming
water
that
rushed
along
the
side
of
the
ship
then
she
laid
one
of
her
hands
on
his
saying
believe
me
mr
somers
i
am
sorry
oh
so
sorry
he
took
her
hand
tenderly
looking
into
her
face
as
he
said
my
dear
child
you
have
no
reason
to
be
sorry
i
know
jack
norgate
well
and
i
know
that
a
better
fellow
does
not
live
you
will
be
happy
with
him
i
am
sure
and
as
for
me
well
i
suppose
i
was
a
bit
of
a
fool
to
think
that
you
do
not
say
that
she
cried
i
am
not
worthy
of
you
i
am
not
worthy
of
him
oh
who
am
i
that
i
should
break
up
such
a
friendship
as
yours
and
his
i
begin
to
wish
that
i
had
never
come
aboard
this
do
not
flatter
yourself
that
you
have
come
between
us
my
dear
he
said
with
a
little
laugh
oh

shall
i
wasting
with
despair
well
i
think
not
men
don
t
waste
with
despair
except
on
the
lyric
stage
my
dear
girl
he
has
won
you
fairly
and
i
congratulate
him
and
you
yes
i
congratulate
you
he
is
a
white
man
as
they
say
on
the
great
pacific
slope
listen
to
that
banjo
confound
it
i
wonder
shall
i
ever
be
able
to
listen
to
the
banjo
again
shall
we
join
the
revellers
in
the
saloon
they
went
into
the
saloon
together
and
took
seats
on
a
vacant
sofa
some
people
eyed
them
suspiciously
and
said
that
miss
compton
was
having
an
exceedingly
good
time
aboard
the
yacht
later
on
somers
congratulated
his
friend
very
sincerely
and
his
friend
accepted
his
congratulations
in
a
very
tolerant
spirit
oh
yes
he
said
i
suppose
it
s
what
every
chap
must
come
to
sooner
or
later
viola
is
far
better
than
i
deserve
than
any
chap
it
s
a
very
poor
sort
of
girl
that
isn
t
better
than
the
best
chap
deserves
and
although
i
think
you
are
the
best
chap
in
the
world
i
should
be
sorry
to
think
that
miss
compton
has
not
made
a
wise
choice
may
you
be
happy
together
thank
you
old
chap
i
must
confess
to
you
frankly
that
some
days
ago
i
thought
that
you
that
i
well
that
you
had
a
certain
tendresse
for
her
i
oh
your
judgment
must
have
been
warped
by
a
lover
s
jealousy
the
thief
doth
think
each
bush
an
officer
the
lover
fancies
that
every
man
s
taste
must
be
the
same
as
his
own
may
you
both
be
happy
it
seemed
that
his
prayer
was
granted
so
far
at
least
as
the
next
day
was
concerned
for
certainly
no
two
people
could
appear
happier
than
the
lovers
as
they
sat
together
under
the
awning
watching
half
a
dozen
of
their
perspiring
over
their
golf
mrs
compton
she
was
an
invalid
taking
the
cruise
for
her
health
s
sake
was
compelled
to
remain
in
her
berth
all
day
but
jack
norgate
visited
her
with
her
daughter
after
tiffin
and
doubtless
obtained
the
maternal
blessing
for
when
he
came
on
deck
alone
in
the
afternoon
his
face
was
beaming
as
moses
face
beamed
on
one
occasion
there
was
a
slight
tornado
about
and
the
vessel
rolled
about
so
as
to
necessitate
the
use
of
the
fiddles
on
the
table
it
continued
blowing
and
raining
until
darkness
set
in
so
that
the
was
crowded
and
three
assembled
in
the
chief
saloon
as
well
as
a
and
a
four
bells
had
just
been
made
when
one
of
the
stewards
startled
all
the
saloon
by
crying
out
of
the
pantries
coming
sir
a
moment
afterwards
he
hurried
into
the
saloon
putting
on
his
jacket
and
looked
round
as
if
waiting
to
receive
an
order
the
passengers
glanced
at
him
and
laughed
what
s
the
matter
asked
the
doctor
didn
t
some
one
call
me
sir
the
man
inquired
not
that
we
heard
replied
the
doctor
i
thought
i
heard
some
one
sing
out
sir
said
the
steward
looking
round
it
must
have
been
some
one
on
deck
suggested
colonel
mydleton
shall
i
cut
the
cards
for
you
doctor
the
steward
went
on
deck
he
was
met
by
mr
somers
who
in
reply
to
the
man
s
inquiry
said
call
you
no
i
didn
t
call
the
infant
samuel
said
one
of
the
poker
players
and
the
others
at
the
table
laughed
it
s
raining
cats
and
dogs
or
whatever
the
equivalent
to
cats
and
dogs
is
in
these
parallels
said
somers
i
got
wet
watching
the
show
a
clean
pair
of
heels
to
a
tramp
she
s
in
our
wake
just
now
i
think
i
ll
turn
into
my
he
went
to
the
bar
and
called
for
a
and
then
sang
out
good
night
as
he
hurried
to
his
cabin
the
next
morning
miss
compton
appeared
at
the
breakfast
table
and
so
did
somers
but
norgate
had
clearly
overslept
himself
for
he
was
absent
the
captain
inquired
for
him
he
must
be
on
deck
sir
said
one
of
the
stewards
for
he
was
not
in
his
cabin
when
i
went
with
his
chocolate
an
hour
oh
he
ll
turn
up
before
we
have
finished
breakfast
said
somers
attacking
his
devilled
kidneys
but
his
prediction
was
not
realised
a
pantry
boy
was
sent
on
deck
in
search
of
mr
norgate
but
mr
norgate
was
not
to
be
found
a
steward
hurried
to
his
cabin
but
returned
in
a
few
minutes
saying
that
his
bunk
had
not
been
slept
in
the
captain
rose
from
the
table
with
a
laugh
a
search
was
organised
it
failed
to
find
him
the
awful
truth
had
to
be
faced
mr
norgate
was
not
aboard
viola
compton
was
hysterical
teddy
somers
was
silent
no
one
had
ever
seen
him
so
deathly
pale
before
theories
were
forthcoming
to
account
for
norgate
s
suicide
people
took
it
for
granted
of
course
that
he
had
committed
suicide
only
one
person
suggested
the
possibility
of
his
having
fallen
overboard
and
of
his
cry
being
that
which
the
steward
had
heard
for
a
part
of
the
pantry
was
open
on
the
starboard
side
but
against
this
it
was
urged
that
mr
somers
must
have
been
on
deck
at
the
time
the
steward
had
heard
or
had
fancied
he
heard
that
cry
and
mr
somers
said
he
had
heard
nothing
for
a
week
the
gloom
hung
over
the
whole
party
but
by
the
time
the
cape
was
reached
miss
compton
was
able
to
appear
at
the
table
once
more
she
looked
heartbroken
but
every
one
said
she
was
bearing
up
wonderfully
only
the
poet
had
the
bad
taste
to
offer
her
his
sympathy
through
the
medium
of
a
sonnet
on
leaving
the
cape
the
bereaved
girl
seemed
to
find
a
certain
plaintive
consolation
in
the
society
of
mr
somers
he
sat
beside
her
in
his
deck
chair
and
they
talked
together
about
poor
jack
norgate
but
after
a
week
or
two
steaming
from
bombay
to
ceylon
and
thence
through
the
straits
to
sydney
they
began
to
talk
about
other
subjects
and
before
long
the
girl
began
visibly
to
brighten
the
passengers
said
she
was
a
woman
and
she
proved
that
they
were
right
for
when
one
lovely
night
teddy
somers
suggested
very
delicately
to
her
that
his
affection
for
her
was
the
same
as
it
had
always
been
there
was
more
than
a
little
reproach
in
her
voice
as
she
cried
oh
stop
stop
for
heaven
s
sake
my
love
is
dead
buried
with
him
i
can
not
hear
any
one
talk
to
me
of
he
pressed
her
hand
and
left
her
without
another
word
she
remained
in
her
deck
chair
far
removed
from
the
rest
of
the
passengers
for
a
long
time
thinking
her
thoughts
whatever
they
may
have
been
the
moon
was
almost
at
the
full
so
that
it
was
high
in
the
sky
before
the
quartermaster
made
six
bells
and
those
of
the
passengers
who
had
not
already
gone
to
their
berths
arose
from
their
chairs
murmuring
that
they
had
no
notion
it
was
within
an
hour
of
midnight
a
few
of
them
passing
the
solitary
figure
of
the
girl
on
her
chair
said
good
night
to
her
in
a
cheery
way
and
then
shook
their
heads
suggestively
together
with
such
an
exchange
of
sentiments
as
poor
girl
poor
girl
very
sad
melancholy
affair
but
it
is
doubtful
if
their
hearts
were
so
overcharged
with
sympathy
as
to
interfere
to
any
marked
degree
with
their
slumbers
the
girl
remained
upon
the
deserted
deck
and
watched
the
quartermasters
collecting
and
storing
away
all
the
passengers
chairs
which
lay
scattered
about
just
as
their
owners
had
vacated
them
when
they
had
finished
their
job
no
one
of
the
ship
s
company
remained
on
the
quarterdeck
the
sound
of
the
little
swish
made
by
a
leaping
had
a
suggestion
of
something
mysterious
about
it
as
it
reached
her
ears
it
seemed
like
the
faint
whisper
of
a
secret
of
the
sea
it
seemed
as
if
some
voice
outside
the
ship
was
saying
hist
to
her
to
attract
her
attention
before
making
a
revelation
to
her
but
she
knew
what
the
sound
was
and
she
did
not
move
from
her
chair
alas
alas
she
murmured
you
can
tell
me
nothing
ah
there
is
nothing
for
me
to
be
told
i
know
all
that
will
be
known
until
the
sea
gives
up
its
dead
he
loved
me
and
the
sea
snatched
him
from
the
tears
with
which
her
heart
was
filled
began
to
overflow
she
wept
softly
for
a
long
time
and
when
at
last
she
gave
a
sigh
and
wiped
the
mist
from
her
eyes
she
found
that
the
moon
previously
so
brilliant
had
become
dim
its
outline
was
blurred
so
that
although
the
atmosphere
was
full
of
moonlight
it
was
impossible
to
say
what
was
the
centre
of
the
illumination
it
seemed
to
viola
as
if
a
thin
diaphanous
silk
curtain
had
fallen
between
the
moon
and
the
sea
every
object
which
an
hour
before
had
cast
a
black
shadow
athwart
the
deck
the
spars
of
the
mainmast
the
quarterboat
hanging
in
its
davits
was
clearly
seen
as
ever
only
without
the
strong
contrasts
of
light
and
shade
the
sea
out
to
the
horizon
was
of
a
luminous
grey
which
bore
but
a
shadowy
resemblance
to
the
carpet
traversed
by
the
glittering
golden
pathway
to
the
moon
over
which
viola
had
pensively
gazed
in
the
early
night
before
somers
had
come
to
her
side
she
now
stood
at
the
bulwarks
looking
across
that
shadowy
expanse
marvelling
at
the
change
which
had
come
about
within
so
short
a
space
of
time
my
life
it
is
my
life
she
sighed
a
short
time
ago
it
was
made
luminous
by
love
but
now
ah
now
she
turned
away
with
another
sigh
and
walked
back
to
her
deck
chair
she
was
in
the
act
of
picking
up
her
cushions
from
the
seat
when
glancing
astern
she
was
amazed
on
becoming
aware
of
the
fact
that
she
was
not
alone
at
that
part
of
the
ship
she
saw
two
figures
standing
together
on
the
raised
poop
that
covered
the
apparatus
at
the
farthest
curve
of
the
stern
she
was
amazed
she
asked
herself
how
it
was
possible
that
she
had
failed
to
see
them
when
she
had
looked
astern
a
few
minutes
before
the
figures
were
of
course
shadowy
in
the
strange
mistily
luminous
atmosphere
but
they
were
sufficiently
conspicuous
in
the
place
where
they
stood
to
make
her
confident
that
had
they
been
there
five
minutes
before
she
would
have
seen
them
she
stood
there
wondering
the
cushion
which
she
had
picked
up
hanging
from
her
hand
who
the
men
were
that
had
come
so
mysteriously
before
her
eyes
an
hour
after
the
last
of
the
passengers
had
as
she
thought
descended
to
their
berths
she
could
not
recognise
either
of
them
they
were
separated
from
her
by
half
the
length
of
the
stern
suddenly
she
gave
a
little
gasp
the
cushion
which
she
had
held
dropped
from
her
hand
for
one
of
the
figures
made
a
movement
turning
his
back
to
the
low
poop
rail
over
which
he
had
been
leaning
and
that
moment
was
enough
even
in
the
pale
light
to
allow
of
her
recognising
the
features
of
jack
norgate
she
gave
a
little
cry
of
mingled
wonder
and
joy
but
before
she
had
taken
even
a
step
toward
that
tableau
she
had
shrieked
out
for
in
the
second
that
separated
her
exclamations
the
figure
whom
she
saw
in
front
of
the
one
she
knew
had
sprung
upon
him
causing
him
to
overbalance
himself
on
the
low
rail
against
which
he
was
leaning
and
to
disappear
over
the
side
she
shrieked
and
sprang
forward
at
that
moment
the
second
figure
seemed
to
fade
away
and
to
vanish
into
nothingness
before
her
eyes
she
staggered
diagonally
across
the
deck
astern
but
before
she
had
taken
more
than
a
dozen
blind
steps
her
foot
caught
in
the
lashing
of
the
tarpaulin
which
was
spread
over
a
pile
of
deck
chairs
and
she
fell
forward
one
of
the
officers
on
watch
who
had
heard
her
cry
swung
himself
down
from
the
roof
of
the
deckhouse
and
ran
to
her
help
good
god
miss
compton
what
has
happened
anyway
he
cried
there
there
she
gasped
pointing
to
the
poop
he
went
over
the
side
a
minute
ago
there
is
still
time
to
stop
the
steamer
and
pick
him
who
went
over
the
side
no
one
was
aft
but
yourself
said
the
officer
it
was
jack
mr
norgate
oh
why
will
you
make
no
effort
to
rescue
him
i
tell
you
that
i
saw
him
go
the
officer
felt
how
she
was
trembling
with
excitement
she
tried
to
rush
across
the
deck
but
would
have
fallen
through
sheer
weakness
if
the
man
had
not
supported
her
he
brought
her
to
the
seat
at
the
side
of
the
cabin
you
are
overcome
miss
compton
he
said
you
must
calm
yourself
while
i
look
into
this
you
do
not
believe
that
i
saw
anything
but
i
tell
you
oh
he
will
be
lost
while
you
are
delaying
she
cried
nothing
of
the
sort
he
said
but
for
heaven
s
sake
sit
here
leave
the
thing
to
he
ran
astern
and
made
a
pretence
of
peering
into
the
distance
of
the
ship
s
seething
wake
he
was
wondering
what
he
should
do
the
poor
girl
was
evidently
the
victim
of
a
hallucination
several
weeks
had
passed
since
her
lover
had
disappeared
and
all
this
time
her
grief
at
his
loss
had
been
poignant
this
thing
that
had
happened
was
the
natural
result
of
the
terrible
strain
upon
her
nerves
of
course
he
never
thought
of
awaking
the
captain
or
of
stopping
the
vessel
while
he
was
still
peering
over
the
taffrail
her
voice
sounded
beside
him
here
it
was
just
here
she
said
he
turned
about
good
lord
miss
compton
you
should
not
have
left
your
seat
he
cried
let
me
help
you
down
to
the
have
you
not
seen
him
in
the
water
there
is
no
one
in
the
water
in
this
light
i
would
be
able
to
see
a
man
s
head
a
mile
astern
i
will
put
my
arm
under
yours
and
help
you
to
get
below
trust
to
me
we
would
all
do
whatever
it
was
in
our
power
for
your
sake
we
all
sympathise
with
you
shall
i
send
a
quartermaster
for
the
doctor
viola
had
thrown
herself
down
on
the
seat
where
he
had
placed
her
and
was
sobbing
with
her
hands
before
her
face
the
man
did
his
best
to
soothe
her
he
made
a
sign
to
a
quartermaster
who
had
come
aft
to
register
the
patent
log
and
told
him
to
send
the
ship
s
doctor
aft
he
had
no
notion
of
accepting
the
sole
responsibility
of
soothing
a
young
woman
who
was
subject
to
disquieting
hallucinations
in
a
few
minutes
the
doctor
relieved
him
of
his
charge
miss
compton
had
become
quite
tranquil
only
now
and
again
she
gazed
into
the
steamer
s
wake
and
pressed
her
hand
to
her
side
she
allowed
herself
to
be
helped
below
in
a
short
time
and
did
not
refuse
the
dose
of
bromide
which
the
doctor
thought
it
his
duty
to
administer
to
her
the
next
day
the
doctor
and
the
fourth
officer
had
a
whispered
conference
they
agreed
that
it
would
be
better
to
say
nothing
to
any
of
the
other
passengers
respecting
miss
compton
s
hallucination
poor
girl
poor
girl
said
the
doctor
i
have
been
observing
her
for
some
time
and
i
can
not
say
that
i
was
surprised
at
what
occurred
last
it
is
only
remarkable
that
the
breakdown
did
not
happen
i
am
glad
that
none
of
the
rest
of
the
ship
s
company
heard
her
when
she
cried
out
said
the
officer
lord
you
should
have
seen
the
look
in
her
eyes
when
she
stretched
out
her
hand
and
insisted
that
she
had
seen
the
man
topple
over
i
thought
it
well
to
do
my
best
to
humour
her
until
i
had
a
chance
of
sending
for
you
i
felt
that
it
was
on
the
cards
that
she
might
throw
herself
over
the
it
was
touch
and
go
said
the
doctor
ah
poor
girl
a
week
had
passed
before
viola
reappeared
among
the
passengers
her
mother
explained
to
kind
inquirers
that
she
had
remained
on
deck
quite
too
late
one
night
and
had
caught
a
chill
the
doctor
bore
out
her
unimaginative
explanation
of
the
girl
s
absence
and
added
that
it
was
much
easier
than
most
people
suspected
to
catch
a
chill
south
of
the
line
when
viola
was
at
last
permitted
to
come
on
deck
she
received
many
tokens
of
the
interest
which
her
had
in
her
progress
toward
recovery
it
was
not
until
the
evening
of
her
first
day
out
of
her
cabin
that
somers
contrived
to
get
a
word
or
two
with
her
alone
he
was
asking
after
her
health
when
she
turned
upon
him
suddenly
saying
mr
somers
it
was
you
who
threw
jack
overboard
good
god
he
cried
starting
back
from
her
for
heaven
s
sake
viola
do
not
say
so
monstrous
a
thing
what
i
jack
you
did
it
she
said
firmly
my
dear
child
how
on
earth
have
you
got
hold
of
such
a
notion
he
asked
her
it
was
revealed
to
me
that
night
the
night
before
i
broke
down
she
replied
i
had
been
sitting
alone
in
my
deck
chair
and
i
was
at
the
point
of
going
below
when
there
there
on
the
poop
at
the
side
of
the
wheel
astern
the
whole
dreadful
scene
was
revealed
to
me
i
tell
you
that
i
saw
it
all
jack
and
you
i
was
not
sure
at
first
that
the
second
figure
was
you
but
i
know
now
that
it
was
you
i
saw
jack
turn
round
and
lean
against
the
rail
and
that
was
the
moment
when
you
sprang
at
the
man
took
some
steps
away
from
her
he
took
off
his
hat
and
wiped
his
forehead
he
returned
to
her
in
a
few
moments
and
said
my
dear
child
oh
viola
how
is
it
possible
for
you
to
entertain
so
horrible
a
thought
jack
norgate
my
best
friend
you
hoped
to
marry
me
he
is
your
rival
you
murdered
him
somers
flung
up
his
hands
with
an
exclamation
and
hurried
down
to
his
cabin
the
next
day
he
came
to
her
after
tiffin
i
want
to
speak
a
word
to
you
apart
he
said
she
went
with
him
very
far
forward
only
a
few
passengers
were
on
deck
and
these
were
in
their
chairs
astern
i
want
to
confess
to
you
he
said
in
a
low
voice
i
want
to
confess
to
you
that
it
was
i
who
threw
jack
norgate
she
started
and
stared
at
him
she
could
not
speak
for
some
time
at
last
she
was
able
to
say
in
a
whisper
you
you
murdered
him
i
murdered
him
the
temptation
came
over
me
oh
viola
you
do
not
know
how
i
loved
you
how
i
love
you
my
god
should
do
it
again
if
i
thought
it
would
give
me
a
chance
of
she
continued
staring
at
him
and
then
seated
herself
by
his
side
you
threw
him
overboard
she
whispered
again
we
were
standing
side
by
side
on
the
poop
deck
far
aft
watching
the
tramp
steamer
on
that
night
the
yacht
was
rolling
he
slipped
i
gave
him
a
push
i
have
lost
my
soul
for
love
of
you
and
you
think
the
sacrifice
oh
it
is
too
horrible
too
terrible
she
said
for
me
for
me
he
was
silent
so
was
she
they
sat
together
side
by
side
for
an
hour
his
terrible
confession
had
dazed
her
she
was
the
first
to
break
the
silence
terrible
it
is
terrible
she
murmured
who
could
have
told
me
that
there
was
any
love
such
as
this
in
the
world
it
is
my
love
for
you
he
said
quietly
it
is
the
love
that
dares
all
all
the
powers
of
time
and
eternity
i
tell
you
that
i
would
do
it
again
i
would
kill
any
other
man
who
came
between
us
but
my
crime
has
been
purposeless
we
are
to
part
for
ever
at
sydney
in
two
yes
she
said
it
is
better
that
we
should
she
gave
him
her
hand
he
held
it
tightly
for
a
moment
then
dropped
it
suddenly
and
left
her
standing
alone
on
the
deck
was
there
ever
such
love
in
the
world
she
murmured
but
it
is
terrible
terrible
the
next
day
she
went
to
where
he
was
sitting
alone
far
from
the
other
passengers
mr
somers
she
said
you
will
not
really
leave
the
yacht
at
sydney
if
you
tell
me
to
stay
i
will
stay
by
the
ship
i
will
stay
by
you
and
you
shall
know
what
love
means
he
said
ah
she
said
i
think
i
have
learned
that
my
beloved
you
tell
me
to
stay
i
believe
that
you
love
me
said
she
my
darling
my
beloved
you
are
more
to
me
than
all
the
world
you
are
dearer
to
me
than
my
hope
of
heaven
yes
you
have
shown
me
that
you
are
speaking
the
truth
it
is
very
terrible
but
i
know
that
it
is
the
it
is
the
truth
and
i
know
that
you
love
i
wonder
if
i
ever
loved
any
one
else
said
she
after
a
pause
that
is
i
wonder
if
any
one
else
ever
loved
me
as
you
have
that
was
all
that
passed
between
them
at
the
time
but
two
days
later
his
hand
was
clasping
hers
as
the
steamer
went
past
the
heads
into
the
loveliest
harbour
of
the
world
it
was
very
early
in
the
morning
when
he
left
his
cabin
to
go
on
deck
the
yacht
was
swinging
at
anchor
the
sound
of
many
voices
came
from
the
deck
she
was
waiting
to
receive
him
at
the
door
of
his
cabin
he
put
both
his
hands
out
to
her
she
did
not
take
even
one
of
them
she
stared
at
him
i
suppose
you
are
the
greatest
scoundrel
in
the
world
she
said
viola
dearest
i
say
you
are
the
greatest
scoundrel
that
ever
lived
for
you
tried
to
obtain
my
love
by
telling
me
a
lie
a
lie
a
horrible
lie
you
did
not
murder
jack
norgate
he
fell
overboard
by
accident
that
night
when
no
one
was
near
him
and
he
was
picked
up
by
the
ocean
tramp
which
you
had
been
watching
not
beside
him
but
on
the
bridge
you
are
a
wicked
man
you
told
me
that
you
murdered
him
but
you
did
nothing
of
the
sort
there
he
is
coming
toward
us
i
did
not
tell
him
how
false
you
were
and
i
do
not
intend
to
tell
him
but
i
know
it
for
it
was
you
yourself
who
suggested
the
thing
to
me
said
he
did
you
not
come
to
me
accusing
me
of
having
murdered
him
did
you
not
say
that
it
had
been
revealed
to
you
in
a
vision
a
vision
oh
i
was
in
need
of
a
dose
of
bromide
that
s
all
said
she
then
jack
norgate
came
up
with
the
captain
by
his
side
the
hand
that
mr
somers
offered
him
was
limp
and
clammy
here
s
another
of
the
ghost
seers
laughed
jack
they
all
look
on
me
as
a
ghost
aboard
this
it
was
a
marvellous
escape
said
the
captain
luckily
the
tramp
was
a
fine
old
slow
tub
and
still
more
luckily
she
had
a
good
for
one
hour
only
why
you
couldn
t
have
been
in
the
water
for
more
than
ten
it
seemed
about
a
week
to
me
old
man
said
jack
and
as
for
the
tramp
well
we
arrived
at
sydney
before
you
any
the
captain
laughed
it
was
a
providential
escape
said
he
it
was
a
providential
escape
said
viola
putting
her
arm
through
jack
s
and
walking
away
with
him
magic
in
the
web
of
i
am
so
pleased
that
it
has
come
about
my
dearest
madge
said
mrs
harland
i
always
hoped
that
julian
would
take
a
fancy
i
mean
that
you
that
you
would
come
to
think
tenderly
of
julian
it
was
the
one
hope
of
my
life
what
should
i
have
done
if
he
had
come
to
me
with
a
story
of
having
fallen
in
love
with
one
of
those
horrid
modern
young
women
the
sort
who
are
for
ever
having
their
names
in
the
papers
about
something
or
other
charities
and
things
charity
has
become
the
most
effective
means
of
in
these
if
he
had
come
to
you
saying
that
he
loved
such
a
girl
you
you
would
have
loved
her
too
you
dear
old
thing
cried
madge
kissing
her
on
both
cheeks
madge
i
m
ashamed
of
you
said
mrs
harland
with
dignity
the
dignity
of
the
lady
with
a
grievance
it
is
of
yourself
you
would
feel
ashamed
if
your
son
came
to
you
with
a
tale
of
loving
a
girl
any
girl
and
you
failed
to
see
her
exactly
with
his
eyes
laughed
madge
but
i
know
you
are
glad
that
your
duty
in
this
respect
is
so
easy
you
have
always
loved
me
haven
t
you
how
could
you
help
it
when
i
think
of
how
naughty
i
used
to
be
of
the
panes
in
the
greenhouse
i
used
to
break
playing
cricket
with
julian
panes
that
involved
no
penalties
when
i
think
of
your
early
peas
that
i
used
to
steal
and
eat
raw
out
of
the
pods
when
i
think
of
all
the
mischief
i
used
to
put
poor
julian
up
to
usually
giving
him
a
good
lead
over
and
when
i
reflect
that
not
once
did
i
ever
receive
more
than
a
verbal
reproof
from
you
then
i
know
that
you
could
not
help
loving
me
it
was
not
my
fault
that
you
did
not
think
of
me
as
the
greatest
nuisance
in
the
mrs
harland
laughed
though
she
had
entered
upon
this
interview
with
the
girl
who
was
to
be
her
very
seriously
and
in
by
no
means
a
laughing
spirit
i
loved
you
always
because
you
were
always
a
girl
to
be
loved
and
my
prayer
day
and
night
dear
was
that
julian
would
come
to
think
so
in
good
time
said
she
i
was
i
admit
slightly
alarmed
to
find
how
very
friendly
you
and
he
always
were
every
one
knows
that
nothing
is
so
fatal
to
falling
in
love
as
great
of
course
said
madge
how
funny
it
was
that
i
should
never
think
about
the
matter
at
all
and
yet
i
feel
that
i
must
always
have
loved
him
just
as
i
do
now
how
could
any
one
help
it
my
dearest
mother
the
fond
mother
of
julian
harland
made
no
attempt
to
answer
so
difficult
a
question
some
mothers
may
be
able
to
formulate
on
economic
grounds
how
it
is
that
young
men
do
not
find
it
impossible
to
resist
the
charms
of
their
numerous
daughters
but
the
mother
of
an
only
son
declines
to
entertain
the
notion
that
he
may
fail
to
attract
any
girl
who
has
had
the
good
fortune
to
appear
attractive
in
his
eyes
that
was
why
mrs
harland
fully
acquiesced
in
madge
s
view
of
the
irresistible
qualities
of
julian
he
is
a
good
boy
he
has
never
been
otherwise
than
a
good
boy
she
said
still
well
i
know
that
his
future
is
safe
in
your
keeping
my
she
had
heard
of
extremely
good
boys
making
extremely
undesirable
matches
with
young
women
in
tobacconists
shops
it
would
seem
as
if
every
university
town
must
be
overflowing
with
tobacconists
shops
and
as
if
every
tobacconist
s
shop
must
be
overcrowded
with
attractive
young
ladies
one
reads
so
much
in
books
written
by
ladies
of
the
undergraduate
victims
to
tobacconists
girls
she
felt
glad
that
her
son
julian
had
not
come
to
her
from
oxford
with
a
story
of
having
made
up
his
mind
that
he
could
only
be
entirely
happy
if
married
to
one
of
these
she
felt
that
he
had
been
a
really
good
son
in
choosing
madge
winston
the
most
beautiful
girl
in
the
county
rather
than
a
girl
from
behind
a
tobacconist
s
counter
yes
he
deserved
great
credit
for
his
discrimination
and
i
am
doubly
glad
that
you
have
become
engaged
just
now
she
continued
you
will
keep
him
at
home
he
has
never
shown
any
tendency
to
roam
again
said
madge
with
an
inquiring
look
into
mrs
harland
s
eyes
he
has
often
said
that
having
had
his
in
kashmir
he
is
perfectly
it
was
not
that
sort
of
shooting
that
was
in
my
mind
said
mrs
harland
but
his
father
was
a
soldier
my
father
was
a
soldier
look
round
the
hall
madge
nothing
but
uniforms
in
every
picture
that
is
why
you
are
afraid
that
if
this
war
breaks
out
in
earnest
that
s
it
that
s
it
he
belongs
to
a
race
of
soldiers
there
has
not
been
a
war
since
blenheim
between
england
and
any
other
power
in
which
a
harland
and
a
severn
have
not
that
is
a
splendid
thing
to
be
able
to
say
and
yet
julian
was
content
with
his
militia
isn
t
that
strange
it
was
for
my
sake
dearest
madge
i
saw
in
his
face
before
he
was
sixteen
the
old
racial
longing
to
be
a
soldier
and
i
made
an
appeal
to
him
he
put
his
career
away
from
him
for
my
sake
madge
he
promised
to
stay
at
home
with
me
in
my
you
were
able
to
make
such
an
appeal
to
him
there
was
a
suggestion
of
surprise
in
the
girl
s
voice
and
it
carried
with
it
a
curious
suggestion
of
coldness
as
well
was
it
selfish
of
me
was
it
madge
oh
i
dare
say
it
was
yes
it
must
have
been
selfish
but
think
of
my
position
dear
he
is
all
i
have
in
the
world
now
what
would
life
be
worth
to
me
if
he
were
away
or
if
he
were
in
danger
and
then
think
of
his
responsibilities
the
property
is
not
a
large
one
and
it
requires
careful
treatment
you
don
t
think
that
i
was
unreasonable
madge
oh
no
no
said
the
girl
you
were
right
quite
right
only
only
only
what
dear
said
mrs
harland
what
is
on
my
mind
exactly
at
this
moment
said
madge
is
that
i
i
would
not
have
been
strong
enough
to
say
that
to
to
say
what
to
him
madge
what
you
said
to
ask
him
to
stay
at
home
when
he
had
his
heart
set
on
being
a
soldier
as
his
father
and
as
his
grandfathers
were
even
now
but
what
s
the
use
of
discussing
a
situation
that
can
not
arise
even
if
the
war
breaks
out
he
is
only
a
militia
captain
so
that
he
can
not
be
called
on
for
duty
in
a
of
course
the
war
will
be
over
in
a
month
or
two
and
there
is
no
chance
of
the
militia
being
called
out
but
it
is
just
for
the
next
month
or
so
that
i
have
my
fears
my
fears
i
should
say
i
have
none
now
that
i
know
that
you
have
promised
to
make
him
happy
to
make
happy
i
had
my
fears
that
at
the
first
sound
of
the
trumpet
in
his
ears
all
the
instincts
of
his
house
look
at
those
uniforms
in
every
picture
round
the
hall
ah
i
was
afraid
that
he
might
ask
me
to
release
him
from
his
and
you
knew
that
you
would
have
released
him
without
a
word
of
demur
said
madge
you
know
that
you
would
do
so
for
you
belong
to
a
fighting
house
too
bless
me
i
m
the
only
representative
of
civilianism
among
you
all
oh
it
is
high
time
that
the
fighting
severns
and
the
fighting
harlands
got
a
pacific
element
introduced
among
that
is
what
i
feel
said
mrs
harland
madge
you
will
not
allow
him
ever
to
yield
to
that
tradition
of
his
house
i
feel
that
so
long
as
he
is
by
your
side
he
is
safe
one
campaign
at
least
will
take
place
without
a
descendant
of
the
harlands
having
anything
to
do
with
before
madge
had
time
to
make
a
reply
the
gravel
of
the
drive
was
sent
flying
against
the
lowest
panes
of
the
room
by
the
feet
of
a
horse
reined
in
suddenly
julian
has
returned
with
some
important
news
said
madge
glancing
outside
in
another
instant
a
man
s
step
sounded
in
the
porch
and
julian
harland
entered
the
old
oak
hall
with
a
newspaper
in
the
same
hand
that
held
his
hunting
crop
it
has
come
at
last
he
cried
war
war
war
england
has
declared
war
against
the
transvaal
said
madge
on
the
contrary
it
is
mr
kruger
the
boer
farmer
who
has
declared
war
against
great
britain
said
he
poor
mr
kruger
said
madge
i
am
sorry
very
sorry
war
is
terrible
i
know
what
war
means
said
mrs
harland
sorry
sorry
cried
her
son
why
what
is
there
to
be
grieved
about
you
re
not
a
friend
of
mr
kruger
s
mother
i
know
what
war
means
said
she
and
i
don
t
said
he
there
was
something
in
his
voice
that
suggested
a
sigh
and
it
seemed
that
he
was
aware
of
this
himself
for
he
threw
his
riding
crop
into
a
corner
and
cried
out
quite
cheerily
i
m
happy
to
feel
all
the
springs
of
domesticity
welling
up
within
my
bosom
since
you
made
me
the
happiest
chap
in
the
county
my
madge
i
have
no
greater
ambition
than
to
sit
in
a
chair
at
one
side
of
the
fire
with
you
to
look
at
my
madge
how
rosy
you
are
my
dear
what
is
keeping
the
lunch
mother
we
must
drink
together
confusion
to
kruger
his
ultimatum
fancy
a
dutch
peasant
having
the
impudence
to
write
an
ultimatum
to
great
britain
it
expires
we
ll
not
leave
the
hall
till
we
are
sure
it
has
he
continued
in
this
excited
strain
during
lunch
and
madge
found
that
she
too
was
in
the
same
vein
war
was
in
the
air
and
while
the
crowds
in
london
were
cheering
aloud
and
singing
god
save
the
queen
with
flashing
eyes
the
little
group
of
three
at
the
table
in
that
old
somerset
hall
stood
up
and
drank
to
the
success
of
the
queen
s
soldiers
in
south
africa
around
them
on
the
oak
panels
were
the
pictures
of
harlands
in
red
coats
harlands
in
blue
coats
harlands
in
the
of
the
stuarts
harlands
in
the
chain
mail
of
the
lancastrians
every
man
of
them
carried
a
sword
and
kept
his
eyes
fixed
on
the
living
head
of
their
house
sternly
anxiously
and
that
was
why
julian
after
drinking
to
the
toast
which
he
had
given
a
moment
before
remained
on
his
feet
with
his
glass
still
in
his
hand
and
with
his
eyes
looking
from
picture
to
picture
as
though
he
had
never
seen
one
of
them
previously
in
his
life
his
mother
watched
him
so
did
madge
the
glass
dropped
from
his
hand
and
was
smashed
in
pieces
on
the
floor
and
he
fell
back
into
his
chair
and
gave
a
loud
laugh
that
s
kruger
he
cried
smashed
smashed
beyond
recovery
beyond
coaguline
smashed
and
without
a
harland
raising
his
hand
against
him
that
s
what
they
are
saying
those
harlands
that
have
had
their
eyes
fixed
on
me
as
if
i
needed
their
prompting
come
along
sweet
womenfolk
and
have
a
look
at
the
sundial
that
rogers
unearthed
when
digging
the
new
where
the
remains
of
the
old
maze
were
the
date
is
carved
on
it
just
think
of
it
hidden
for
perhaps
three
hundred
years
and
only
unearthed
yesterday
at
the
very
hour
that
you
promised
to
be
my
own
madge
a
good
omen
what
does
it
mean
except
that
a
new
era
for
the
old
house
is
beginning
come
along
my
there
was
no
great
alacrity
in
madge
s
response
to
his
challenge
ii
his
father
was
killed
in
the
soudan
having
inherited
the
property
when
his
elder
brother
had
been
killed
a
few
years
before
in
four
brothers
all
of
them
men
of
splendid
physique
had
been
slain
in
battle
within
a
space
of
four
years
and
three
widows
and
many
children
had
been
left
desolate
he
knew
the
story
of
heroism
associated
with
every
one
of
the
four
and
he
knew
the
stories
of
the
heroism
associated
with
the
death
of
his
grandfather
at
the
alma
and
his
greatgrandfather
at
waterloo
that
was
why
he
had
taken
it
for
granted
from
his
earliest
years
that
he
was
to
be
a
solder
it
never
occurred
to
him
that
there
was
any
other
destiny
possible
for
a
harland
of
the
hall
but
when
his
mother
came
to
him
one
day
and
poured
her
plaint
into
his
ear
entreating
him
for
her
sake
to
think
of
himself
as
associated
with
a
happier
fate
he
had
yielded
to
her
though
he
made
no
admissions
in
regard
to
the
comparative
happiness
involved
in
the
fate
of
dying
on
the
field
of
battle
or
as
a
senile
after
a
protracted
run
to
hounds
he
showed
himself
to
be
a
dutiful
son
and
he
went
to
oxford
and
then
ate
his
dinners
at
the
temple
as
he
believed
a
reasonably
aspiring
country
gentleman
should
do
if
he
wished
to
retain
his
he
had
also
drilled
every
year
with
the
militia
regiment
in
which
he
held
a
commission
and
was
rapidly
qualifying
for
the
rank
of
major
but
during
these
years
the
country
was
engaged
in
no
war
that
made
any
great
demand
upon
its
resources
he
had
no
great
temptation
to
go
against
the
afridis
and
he
felt
sure
that
khartoum
could
be
reached
by
kitchener
without
his
personal
supervision
but
his
mother
noticed
a
change
upon
him
as
he
read
day
by
day
of
the
probabilities
of
a
war
breaking
out
between
england
and
the
transvaal
a
strange
uneasiness
seemed
to
have
come
over
him
and
he
talked
of
nothing
except
south
africa
as
a
campaigning
ground
his
mother
became
more
uneasy
than
he
was
and
she
was
only
in
a
measure
relieved
when
one
day
he
came
to
her
telling
her
that
he
had
asked
madge
winston
the
daughter
of
the
vicar
of
hurst
harland
to
marry
him
and
that
she
had
consented
mrs
harland
told
him
that
he
had
made
her
the
happiest
mother
in
the
world
but
from
the
chat
just
recorded
which
she
had
with
madge
in
the
hall
before
julian
had
returned
with
the
news
of
the
ultimatum
it
will
be
gathered
that
she
had
still
some
misgivings
they
were
strengthened
by
observing
julian
s
strange
behaviour
during
the
drinking
of
the
toast
she
saw
the
light
that
was
in
his
eyes
as
he
talked
a
little
wildly
about
the
coming
campaign
she
had
seen
such
a
light
in
the
eyes
of
his
father
when
talking
of
a
coming
campaign
she
knew
what
it
meant
she
did
not
accompany
julian
and
madge
when
they
went
out
together
to
look
at
the
old
pillar
sundial
which
a
gardener
had
dug
up
the
day
before
she
was
happily
able
to
make
a
reasonable
excuse
for
staying
behind
a
servant
had
just
brought
her
a
message
to
the
effect
that
one
of
the
lacemakers
of
the
village
had
come
by
appointment
to
see
her
she
had
interested
herself
for
several
years
in
the
lacemaking
and
was
in
the
habit
of
getting
old
pieces
of
her
own
splendid
collection
repaired
by
one
of
the
cleverest
of
the
girls
this
girl
was
still
in
the
hall
when
julian
and
madge
were
driven
indoors
by
a
slight
shower
and
mrs
harland
showed
them
the
piece
of
work
which
she
had
had
mended
it
was
a
delicate
handkerchief
bordered
with
rosebuds
and
curiously
enough
as
julian
pointed
out
the
sprays
arranged
themselves
so
as
to
form
a
constant
repetition
of
the
letter
that
stands
for
madge
doesn
t
it
cried
he
it
stands
for
medici
said
his
mother
this
particular
piece
of
lace
belonged
to
marie
de
medici
though
no
one
ever
noticed
that
the
rosebuds
entwined
themselves
into
the
letter
i
will
buy
the
handkerchief
from
my
mother
for
you
madge
he
cried
who
knows
what
magic
may
be
in
the
web
of
it
like
poor
desdemona
s
these
medici
were
uncanny
folk
the
earlier
ones
certainly
understood
the
art
of
magic
as
practised
by
the
highest
authorities
in
the
middle
ages
yes
the
m
stands
for
madge
take
it
dear
i
won
t
be
so
ungracious
as
to
add
othello
s
charge
to
desdemona
about
keeping
it
and
if
i
should
find
it
in
a
railway
carriage
or
anywhere
else
in
years
to
come
you
may
make
your
mind
easy
i
ll
not
strangle
you
on
that
i
got
it
mended
on
purpose
for
you
madge
said
mrs
harland
you
are
so
good
said
the
girl
spreading
out
the
filmy
thing
admiringly
you
know
that
there
is
nothing
i
love
so
well
as
lace
and
this
design
is
the
most
perfect
that
could
be
imagined
a
thousand
thanks
dearest
julian
seemed
before
the
evening
to
have
become
quite
resigned
to
staying
at
home
and
during
the
next
few
weeks
though
he
followed
the
progress
of
the
preparations
for
the
campaign
with
great
interest
pointing
out
what
he
believed
would
be
the
plans
of
each
of
the
divisional
commanders
to
his
mother
and
madge
yet
he
never
semed
to
be
unduly
eager
in
the
matter
he
seemed
to
look
on
the
campaign
in
a
purely
academic
spirit
merely
as
a
kriegspiel
and
his
mother
s
fears
vanished
she
blessed
the
day
that
madge
had
come
to
the
hall
it
was
madge
and
madge
only
who
had
succeeded
in
restraining
his
burning
desire
to
be
in
the
thick
of
the
fight
but
then
following
swiftly
upon
the
news
of
the
arrival
of
the
first
army
corps
and
the
successes
of
the
sorties
from
ladysmith
which
elated
the
whole
of
england
for
some
days
came
like
a
thunderclap
the
news
of
a
disaster
a
second
disaster
a
third
it
seemed
as
if
the
campaign
was
going
to
collapse
before
it
had
well
begun
the
change
made
itself
apparent
in
every
part
of
england
in
every
household
in
england
and
in
none
more
vividly
than
at
harland
hall
a
change
had
come
over
julian
he
had
no
word
for
any
one
he
walked
moodily
about
the
house
and
the
grounds
taking
no
interest
in
anything
he
made
an
excuse
for
going
up
to
london
for
a
day
or
two
and
he
returned
with
a
mass
of
news
the
country
had
been
taken
by
surprise
in
regard
to
the
boer
preparations
the
campaign
was
going
to
be
a
long
one
and
every
available
man
was
to
be
called
out
he
had
it
from
good
authority
the
best
authority
in
the
world
his
mother
saw
that
the
old
light
had
come
back
to
his
eyes
and
she
shuddered
the
next
morning
when
madge
came
downstairs
she
saw
her
sitting
in
the
hall
with
her
head
bent
down
her
son
standing
over
her
with
a
paper
in
his
hands
madge
madge
cried
the
mother
you
will
tell
him
to
stay
he
is
going
to
leave
us
but
you
will
tell
him
to
stay
he
will
stay
if
you
implore
of
yes
said
he
i
will
stay
if
madge
asks
me
but
she
will
not
ask
you
will
ask
him
you
will
implore
of
him
to
stay
madge
my
daughter
cried
mrs
harland
there
was
a
long
silence
the
girl
had
become
deathly
pale
she
stood
at
her
chair
at
the
table
she
did
not
speak
why
are
you
silent
why
are
you
dumb
cried
the
mother
will
you
see
him
go
forth
to
die
as
all
the
others
of
his
family
have
done
in
the
past
can
not
you
understand
what
has
happened
oh
you
have
only
just
come
down
you
have
not
heard
the
news
the
last
of
the
reserves
have
been
called
out
and
volunteers
are
being
called
on
from
the
militia
and
i
have
volunteered
said
julian
in
a
low
voice
she
was
still
deathly
pale
her
hands
grasped
the
carved
back
of
the
chair
she
did
not
speak
dear
madge
you
will
tell
him
began
mrs
harland
yes
said
the
girl
i
will
tell
him
that
i
am
proud
of
him
that
if
he
had
remained
at
home
now
i
would
never
have
married
him
she
walked
steadily
across
the
hall
and
put
both
her
hands
out
to
him
he
took
them
in
his
own
and
bent
his
head
down
to
them
kissing
each
of
them
then
he
raised
his
head
and
looked
round
at
the
portraits
in
the
panels
and
laughed
he
left
the
hall
in
the
evening
iii
it
was
the
most
dismal
christmas
that
any
one
in
england
could
remember
here
and
there
a
success
had
been
snatched
from
the
enemy
but
the
list
of
casualties
published
every
day
made
the
morning
papers
a
terror
to
read
the
british
losses
had
passed
the
tenth
thousand
and
still
buller
could
not
reach
ladysmith
and
methuen
could
not
cross
the
modder
it
seemed
as
if
the
last
of
the
egyptian
plagues
had
fallen
on
england
and
there
was
not
a
household
in
which
there
was
not
one
dead
it
was
a
dreary
christmas
at
harland
hall
news
had
arrived
a
few
days
previously
of
julian
s
safe
arrival
at
the
cape
and
of
his
having
taken
part
in
a
skirmish
on
his
way
to
the
front
every
morning
his
mother
and
madge
who
had
come
to
stay
at
the
hall
for
another
month
picked
up
the
newspaper
and
glanced
with
fearing
eyes
down
the
usual
casualty
list
when
they
failed
to
find
his
name
there
they
breathed
again
there
was
no
thought
of
festivity
in
the
hall
this
christmas
day
and
it
was
a
relief
to
madge
as
well
as
to
mrs
harland
when
bedtime
came
before
going
to
bed
the
girl
sat
for
some
time
before
the
fire
in
her
room
with
julian
s
portrait
in
her
hand
and
on
her
lap
some
of
the
things
which
his
hands
had
touched
a
shrivelled
november
rose
which
he
had
discovered
on
the
last
stroll
they
had
together
through
the
garden
a
swan
s
feather
which
he
had
picked
up
and
thrust
with
a
laugh
and
a
mock
taunt
into
her
hair
the
lace
handkerchief
which
had
been
given
to
her
on
the
day
of
the
outbreak
of
the
war
she
sat
there
lost
in
her
own
thoughts
praying
her
own
prayers
suddenly
she
became
aware
of
an
unusual
sound
a
sort
of
tap
at
rare
intervals
upon
her
at
first
she
fancied
that
it
was
a
twig
of
ivy
which
was
being
blown
by
the
breeze
against
the
window
but
the
next
time
the
sound
came
she
felt
sure
that
it
could
only
be
produced
by
a
tiny
pebble
flung
up
from
the
carriage
drive
for
a
few
moments
she
was
slightly
alarmed
she
quickly
extinguished
her
candle
however
and
then
went
to
the
window
drawing
the
blind
a
little
way
to
one
side
and
peering
out
there
was
no
moon
but
the
sky
was
full
of
stars
and
she
knew
that
if
any
one
was
on
the
drive
there
was
light
enough
to
make
her
aware
of
the
fact
for
some
time
however
her
eyes
accustomed
to
the
light
of
her
room
were
unable
to
make
out
any
figure
below
but
after
waiting
at
the
window
for
a
few
minutes
it
seemed
to
her
that
she
could
detect
the
figure
of
a
man
in
the
middle
of
the
drive
she
shut
out
all
the
light
of
the
fire
behind
her
and
continued
peering
beyond
a
doubt
there
was
a
man
outside
he
was
waving
something
white
up
to
her
in
another
instant
she
knew
him
a
terrible
fear
took
hold
upon
her
for
she
knew
that
she
was
looking
out
at
a
man
in
khaki
uniform
and
she
knew
that
that
man
was
julian
harland
and
now
she
saw
him
distinctly
in
the
starlight
he
was
making
signs
to
her
pointing
to
the
porch
and
walking
in
that
direction
she
dropped
the
blind
there
was
no
doubt
whatever
in
her
mind
now
julian
had
returned
suddenly
and
for
some
reason
he
wished
to
be
admitted
into
the
house
secretly
she
stole
down
the
broad
shallow
staircase
into
the
hall
and
by
the
light
of
the
glowing
logs
which
smouldered
in
the
big
grate
she
found
her
way
to
the
oaken
door
that
shut
off
the
porch
from
the
hall
she
loosened
its
chains
as
silently
as
possible
and
opened
it
then
she
went
through
to
the
porch
and
found
herself
standing
opposite
the
studded
hall
door
there
she
paused
for
an
instant
asking
herself
if
she
should
open
it
a
low
tap
sounded
on
it
from
the
outside
i
am
here
she
said
in
a
low
voice
am
i
to
open
the
door
for
you
julian
open
madge
quick
quick
i
am
wounded
he
said
with
trembling
fingers
she
unfastened
the
bolt
opened
the
door
and
allowed
him
to
pass
into
the
porch
o
my
darling
have
you
been
wounded
she
cried
she
had
not
put
herself
into
his
arms
she
had
a
sense
of
his
being
wounded
and
she
was
afraid
of
hurting
him
by
coming
in
contact
with
the
wound
she
felt
his
hand
on
hers
it
is
really
only
a
trifle
madge
said
he
you
will
be
able
to
bind
it
up
for
me
and
you
must
not
awaken
poor
mother
the
shock
of
seeing
me
might
kill
they
went
side
by
side
into
the
hall
and
he
sank
down
with
a
sigh
of
relief
on
the
big
settee
before
the
fire
she
broke
up
one
of
the
smouldering
logs
and
it
glowed
into
a
great
flame
which
showed
her
that
his
face
was
very
pale
and
that
he
had
grown
a
beard
she
was
on
her
knees
at
his
knees
in
a
moment
dearest
julian
she
cried
with
her
arms
about
him
how
did
you
come
without
sending
me
word
oh
where
are
you
wounded
the
arm
the
right
he
said
rather
feebly
it
is
only
a
flesh
wound
i
know
but
it
was
enough
to
knock
me
over
and
it
has
been
bleeding
badly
if
you
wash
it
and
bind
it
up
a
bit
however
it
will
be
all
right
until
the
morning
when
i
can
have
it
looked
slowly
and
painfully
he
raised
his
right
arm
he
had
apparently
slit
up
the
sleeve
of
his
tunic
and
the
pieces
fell
away
to
the
right
and
left
of
his
arm
showing
her
a
wound
black
with
coagulated
blood
my
poor
boy
my
poor
boy
she
said
i
shall
do
my
best
with
it
but
it
is
an
ugly
wound
why
should
i
not
send
a
man
to
the
surgery
dr
gwynne
will
come
at
no
no
he
said
i
don
t
want
to
make
a
fuss
at
this
hour
you
can
manage
without
outside
help
hadn
t
you
better
light
the
candles
she
sprang
to
her
feet
and
picking
up
one
of
the
long
chips
from
the
log
basket
lighted
it
in
the
fire
and
then
transferred
the
flame
to
two
of
the
old
sconces
at
the
side
of
the
fireplace
as
the
light
flickered
on
him
she
saw
that
his
tunic
was
torn
and
splashed
and
that
his
putties
were
caked
with
mire
no
wayside
tramp
could
be
in
a
more
dilapidated
condition
than
julian
was
in
he
had
clearly
been
walking
some
distance
and
yet
she
could
not
recollect
seeing
any
clay
for
miles
around
of
the
same
tint
as
that
which
was
caked
upon
his
garments
she
was
about
to
ask
him
why
he
should
not
go
upstairs
to
his
own
room
where
she
could
attend
to
him
properly
but
she
restrained
her
nurse
s
instinct
to
ask
an
irritated
patient
questions
she
examined
the
wound
and
said
i
will
wash
it
for
you
and
bind
it
up
till
the
morning
i
shall
get
a
basin
in
my
own
a
ministering
angel
thou
he
said
with
a
very
wan
smile
by
the
way
madge
do
you
remember
the
lace
handkerchief
the
medici
handkerchief
i
was
looking
at
it
only
an
hour
ago
she
said
there
s
magic
in
the
web
of
it
he
said
fetch
it
and
bind
up
my
wound
with
that
cobweb
drawn
over
rosebuds
and
i
shall
be
all
she
hastened
to
her
room
and
in
a
few
moments
had
picked
out
from
a
drawer
some
soft
linen
a
bottle
of
arnica
and
a
pair
of
scissors
she
had
attended
ambulance
classes
and
had
confidence
in
her
own
capacity
to
deal
with
any
ordinary
then
she
put
the
lace
medici
handkerchief
with
the
other
appliances
and
carrying
a
large
china
bowl
with
her
water
jug
came
quietly
down
the
stairs
once
more
he
had
fallen
asleep
on
the
settee
but
in
an
instant
he
was
awake
he
was
plainly
vigilant
at
once
it
is
beginning
to
feel
a
bit
stiff
but
that
is
on
account
of
the
bleeding
he
said
i
knew
i
was
doing
wisely
in
awaking
you
only
i
couldn
t
stand
a
i
will
make
no
fuss
she
said
and
i
shall
hurt
you
as
little
as
possible
i
will
even
refrain
from
asking
you
any
that
s
right
i
feel
so
sleepy
said
he
in
a
deft
and
businesslike
way
she
washed
the
clotted
blood
from
the
wound
and
she
quickly
perceived
that
it
was
only
a
deep
flesh
wound
but
it
had
bled
a
great
deal
and
that
had
weakened
him
she
bandaged
the
arm
with
layers
of
linen
and
when
the
bandage
was
secure
he
cried
now
for
the
handkerchief
that
will
make
me
all
right
in
a
moment
the
earlier
medici
were
i
told
you
wonderful
folk
though
the
later
ah
you
are
a
good
she
knew
that
he
must
be
humoured
she
made
no
protest
against
using
her
handkerchief
in
such
a
way
you
have
no
idea
how
relieved
i
feel
said
he
my
dearest
girl
i
knew
that
i
would
be
safe
in
your
hands
now
get
me
a
big
drink
of
water
and
i
shall
be
all
she
hastened
to
where
a
great
carafe
and
its
goblet
stood
on
the
oak
sideboard
he
gave
an
exclamation
that
suggested
more
than
satisfaction
while
the
water
was
sobbing
in
the
throat
of
the
bottle
and
when
he
had
drunk
a
clear
pint
he
gave
a
sigh
i
haven
t
had
such
a
drink
for
weeks
he
said
now
dear
girl
i
m
dying
with
sleep
and
so
i
fancy
are
you
do
not
mean
to
sleep
here
she
cried
you
will
go
to
your
own
room
julian
dear
a
fire
has
been
lighted
in
it
every
day
to
keep
out
any
possible
i
couldn
t
think
of
such
luxury
when
so
many
of
my
poor
comrades
are
lying
under
the
cold
stars
said
he
don
t
urge
me
madge
but
go
to
your
own
bed
and
sleep
even
while
she
was
still
looking
at
him
he
laid
his
head
back
among
the
pillows
of
the
settee
and
fell
asleep
she
waited
by
his
side
only
for
a
few
moments
and
then
went
quietly
up
to
her
room
she
threw
herself
on
her
knees
by
her
bedside
and
wept
tears
of
joy
at
the
thought
that
he
had
come
safe
home
again
with
only
a
wound
that
a
few
weeks
would
heal
but
when
she
had
undressed
and
got
into
bed
she
could
not
help
feeling
that
his
homecoming
was
strange
beyond
imagination
he
had
sent
no
telegram
he
had
arrived
with
the
stains
of
battle
still
on
his
uniform
and
strangest
of
all
his
wound
was
not
an
old
one
not
many
hours
had
passed
since
he
had
sustained
it
what
on
earth
was
the
explanation
of
all
this
she
felt
unequal
to
the
task
of
working
out
the
question
she
felt
that
all
other
thoughts
should
give
place
to
the
glorious
thought
that
he
was
safe
at
home
he
would
explain
everything
in
the
morning
iv
when
she
awoke
this
thought
was
dominant
he
was
at
home
safe
safe
she
listened
at
the
door
of
his
room
to
catch
his
cheery
laughter
with
the
first
of
the
servants
who
might
discover
him
but
no
such
sound
came
to
her
ears
she
was
nearly
dressed
when
mrs
harland
entered
her
room
well
she
cried
well
you
have
seen
him
good
heavens
why
do
you
look
at
me
in
that
way
have
you
not
seen
him
dear
madge
said
mrs
harland
your
eyes
have
a
strange
gleam
in
them
what
do
you
mean
by
asking
me
if
i
have
seen
him
is
there
more
than
one
for
me
and
for
you
but
he
came
here
late
last
night
he
threw
pebbles
up
at
that
window
and
i
let
him
into
the
hall
and
bound
up
a
wound
of
his
a
flesh
wound
only
i
left
him
sleeping
on
the
mrs
harland
stared
at
her
my
poor
madge
she
said
you
have
had
a
vivid
dream
how
could
he
possibly
have
been
here
when
not
a
week
has
passed
since
we
got
a
cablegram
from
him
it
would
take
him
a
week
to
get
back
to
cape
town
i
don
t
try
to
explain
anything
said
she
only
he
came
into
the
hall
as
sure
as
we
stand
here
together
and
i
bound
up
his
wound
just
below
the
elbow
of
the
right
arm
if
i
did
not
do
so
where
is
the
lace
handkerchief
here
are
all
the
things
i
was
looking
at
before
i
heard
the
sound
of
the
pebbles
on
the
window
and
the
medici
handkerchief
was
there
too
where
is
it
now
poor
child
poor
madge
cried
mrs
harland
you
must
try
to
keep
your
thoughts
away
from
him
for
a
day
or
two
you
and
i
need
a
change
of
scene
oh
no
i
am
not
going
mad
i
can
assure
you
my
dearest
mother
said
madge
i
tell
you
that
where
is
the
handkerchief
there
is
the
breakfast
gong
said
mrs
harland
i
believe
you
dear
you
were
with
him
in
madge
laughed
and
went
downstairs
she
gave
a
glance
at
the
sconce
in
which
she
had
lighted
the
candles
it
contained
four
candles
burnt
down
to
the
sockets
the
papers
had
no
special
news
but
later
in
the
day
two
telegrams
arrived
one
was
for
mrs
harland
the
other
for
madge
they
tore
open
the
covers
with
palpitating
fingers
the
first
dispatch
said
wound
very
the
second
that
addressed
to
madge
said
you
they
exchanged
telegrams
but
not
a
word
he
was
invalided
home
after
acting
as
escort
to
cronje
down
to
cape
town
and
saving
a
gun
at
reddersburg
mentioned
in
despatches
but
no
one
alluded
to
the
wound
which
he
had
sustained
on
christmas
day
in
a
skirmish
at
the
modder
one
evening
however
when
he
was
able
to
sit
outside
the
house
madge
turned
to
him
saying
what
did
you
mean
by
sending
me
that
telegram
you
dearest
he
gave
a
laugh
i
wonder
if
you
have
still
by
you
that
medici
handkerchief
he
said
no
she
said
after
a
moment
s
hesitation
i
must
plead
as
desdemona
did
about
hers
it
disappeared
mysteriously
i
can
not
produce
it
for
you
my
ah
now
i
should
get
as
mad
as
any
othello
said
he
but
on
second
thoughts
i
will
listen
dear
julian
she
said
i
am
resolved
to
confess
all
to
you
though
you
may
think
me
a
bit
of
a
fool
listen
on
christmas
night
i
went
to
my
room
and
seated
myself
before
the
fire
thinking
of
you
dearest
your
portrait
was
in
my
hands
and
on
the
table
were
some
of
the
treasures
your
hands
had
touched
the
handkerchief
among
them
then
i
heard
i
seemed
to
hear
no
i
prefer
to
tell
the
truth
i
actually
heard
the
sound
of
a
pebble
flung
against
my
window
i
looked
out
i
saw
you
on
the
drive
and
i
went
downstairs
and
opened
the
hall
door
for
you
you
were
wounded
just
where
you
were
actually
wounded
and
i
bound
up
your
arm
with
the
handkerchief
and
went
to
bed
in
the
morning
there
was
no
sign
of
your
having
been
here
but
but
the
handkerchief
was
gone
don
t
think
me
a
a
goose
heavens
a
goose
he
cried
listen
to
my
story
dear
when
i
was
wounded
in
that
scrimmage
i
fainted
through
loss
of
blood
and
when
i
recovered
my
senses
i
went
in
search
of
the
ambulance
tent
it
was
late
before
i
came
across
a
transport
waggon
which
had
been
disabled
by
a
shell
i
crept
inside
it
but
found
nothing
there
and
i
was
dying
of
thirst
and
then
then
you
came
to
me
with
bandages
and
water
plenty
of
water
in
the
carafe
that
stands
on
the
sideboard
you
lighted
a
candle
bound
up
my
arm
and
left
me
comfortably
asleep
where
i
was
found
by
our
ambulance
in
the
morning
yes
that
s
the
truth
and
that
is
why
i
sent
you
the
telegram
and
this
is
the
handkerchief
with
the
stains
upon
it
he
drew
the
lace
handkerchief
out
of
his
pocket
and
handed
it
to
her
she
gazed
at
it
but
he
only
laughed
and
said
i
told
you
there
s
magic
in
the
web
of
the
baseless
fabric
tis
sorry
that
you
ll
be
to
hear
that
ould
denny
callan
is
dead
sir
said
the
he
was
strictly
speaking
the
at
mallow
to
whom
i
had
confided
my
hopes
of
eventually
reaching
my
destination
at
st
barter
s
in
the
same
county
he
had
been
courteously
voluble
and
sometimes
even
explicit
in
giving
me
advice
on
this
subject
he
also
took
an
optimistic
view
of
the
situation
all
things
considered
and
with
a
moderate
share
of
good
luck
i
might
reasonably
hope
to
reach
st
barter
s
house
within
a
couple
of
hours
that
point
which
was
becoming
one
of
great
interest
to
me
being
settled
he
thought
that
he
was
entitled
to
assume
that
i
should
be
grieved
to
hear
of
the
death
of
ould
denny
he
assumed
too
much
i
had
never
heard
the
name
of
the
lamented
mr
callan
i
could
not
pretend
to
be
overwhelmed
with
grief
at
the
news
that
some
one
was
dead
whom
i
had
never
heard
of
being
alive
tubbe
sure
you
re
a
stranger
sir
what
am
i
thinking
of
at
all
or
you
d
know
all
about
the
road
to
st
barter
s
said
the
official
oh
but
you
d
have
liked
ould
denny
sir
if
you
d
but
have
known
him
a
more
harmless
crayture
you
couldn
t
find
search
high
or
low
tis
a
great
favourite
that
he
was
with
the
gentlemen
ay
and
for
that
matter
the
ladies
though
i
wouldn
t
like
to
say
a
word
against
him
that
s
gone
oh
they
all
come
away
from
st
barter
s
with
a
good
word
for
denny
well
well
he
s
at
rest
and
i
don
t
expect
that
you
ll
have
to
wait
much
longer
for
your
train
when
i
had
got
out
of
my
compartment
in
the
express
from
dublin
an
hour
before
i
was
told
that
i
should
only
have
to
wait
for
ten
minutes
to
make
the
connection
that
would
take
me
on
to
blarney
the
station
for
st
barter
s
but
the
train
which
was
reputed
to
be
able
to
perform
this
service
for
me
had
not
yet
been
signalled
after
the
lapse
of
another
twenty
minutes
i
began
to
think
that
the
stationmaster
had
taken
too
roseate
a
view
of
my
future
it
did
not
seem
likely
that
i
should
in
the
language
of
the
manual
attain
my
objective
that
day
i
had
reached
a
stage
of
bewildering
doubt
which
was
not
mitigated
by
the
arrival
at
the
junction
of
a
long
train
and
the
announcement
of
the
guard
to
the
passengers
change
here
for
ameriky
it
was
explained
to
me
that
the
train
was
full
of
emigrants
bound
for
america
via
queenstown
when
the
bustled
up
to
tell
me
that
the
blarney
special
had
just
been
signalled
from
kilmallock
the
blarney
special
was
getting
on
very
well
and
with
good
luck
should
be
available
for
passengers
from
mallow
within
half
an
hour
the
good
luck
on
which
this
estimate
was
founded
was
not
lacking
my
train
crawled
alongside
the
platform
only
five
minutes
over
the
and
the
official
wished
me
a
continuance
of
good
luck
adding
it
wouldn
t
be
like
going
back
to
the
same
place
now
that
poor
ould
denny
is
gone
if
you
had
ever
been
there
before
sir
best
his
sowl
tis
the
harmless
crayture
that
he
was
you
ll
be
sorry
that
you
didn
t
know
him
sir
when
you
find
the
place
a
bit
i
was
to
blarney
before
my
sluggish
mind
was
able
to
appreciate
the
contingencies
suggested
by
the
i
had
never
before
been
to
st
barter
s
but
if
i
had
ever
been
there
i
should
regret
my
returning
to
the
place
now
that
a
certain
person
of
whose
existence
i
had
been
unaware
was
gone
that
was
how
i
worked
out
the
matter
and
before
i
had
concluded
the
operation
i
had
become
quite
emotional
in
regard
to
the
demise
of
denny
i
shook
my
head
mournfully
at
the
thought
that
i
should
never
see
him
that
i
had
come
too
late
too
late
i
had
no
idea
that
the
local
colour
which
is
associated
by
tradition
with
this
neighbourhood
was
so
potent
but
indeed
when
the
obliging
at
blarney
who
entered
into
conversation
with
me
while
the
porter
was
looking
after
my
luggage
remarked
so
poor
ould
denny
is
gone
at
last
sir
i
shook
my
head
sadly
poor
old
denny
poor
old
denny
i
said
with
a
sigh
ah
we
ll
all
miss
poor
old
denny
he
was
the
most
harmless
man
st
barter
s
will
not
be
the
same
without
the
did
his
best
to
comfort
me
for
half
an
hour
that
was
the
exact
space
that
i
had
to
wait
for
the
car
which
was
to
carry
me
to
st
barter
s
when
it
did
arrive
the
excuse
given
by
the
boy
who
had
charge
of
the
wee
mare
was
that
it
was
a
grand
wake
entirely
that
denny
had
last
night
he
told
me
more
about
it
with
statistics
of
certain
comestibles
mostly
liquid
when
driving
along
one
of
the
loveliest
roads
possible
to
imagine
past
the
grey
square
tower
of
blarney
castle
embowered
among
its
trees
and
on
by
the
side
of
the
greenest
slopes
i
had
ever
seen
beneath
the
branches
of
one
of
the
groves
renowned
in
history
and
in
song
a
broad
stream
flowed
parallel
with
the
road
and
every
glimpse
that
i
had
through
the
trees
on
both
sides
was
of
emerald
hills
some
in
the
distance
others
apparently
sending
their
soft
ridges
athwart
the
road
i
felt
that
at
last
i
was
in
ireland
on
the
side
of
a
gracious
slope
gradually
approached
by
broad
zigzag
drives
which
follow
the
swelling
curves
of
long
grassy
billows
the
buildings
of
st
barter
s
stand
they
are
neither
venerable
nor
imposing
only
queer
it
seemed
to
me
that
everybody
must
have
been
concerned
in
their
construction
except
an
architect
but
the
compiler
of
a
could
with
every
desire
to
be
economical
of
his
space
fill
half
a
dozen
pages
with
a
description
of
the
landscape
which
faces
the
windows
of
the
front
the
green
terraces
below
the
gardens
dip
toward
the
brink
of
a
glen
through
which
a
trout
stream
rushes
and
the
woods
of
this
sylvan
hollow
straggle
up
the
farther
slope
and
spread
over
it
in
a
blaze
of
autumnal
gold
that
glows
half
through
the
winter
where
the
wooded
slopes
and
the
range
of
green
hills
begin
undulating
into
a
soft
distance
of
pasturages
with
here
and
there
a
white
farmhouse
shining
out
of
the
shadow
of
an
orchard
and
at
the
dividing
line
of
the
low
slopes
the
turret
of
blarney
castle
appears
above
the
dark
cloud
of
its
own
woods
before
i
found
myself
facing
this
entrancing
landscape
i
could
not
for
the
life
of
me
understand
why
my
client
who
might
have
lived
where
she
pleased
should
spend
half
the
year
at
st
barter
s
but
now
i
understood
and
i
took
back
the
words
which
i
had
spoken
more
than
once
when
in
the
previous
night
a
family
solicitor
may
be
pardoned
for
occasionally
calling
a
client
a
fool
i
had
called
several
of
my
most
valued
clients
by
this
name
i
did
so
for
the
same
reason
that
adam
gave
for
calling
the
fox
a
fox
because
it
was
a
fox
but
i
had
never
to
retract
until
now
hydros
are
horrors
as
a
rule
but
st
barter
s
is
a
beatitude
a
couple
of
hours
after
lunch
the
water
which
was
placed
on
our
table
was
as
exhilarating
as
champagne
sufficed
for
the
transaction
of
the
business
which
had
brought
me
to
ireland
and
i
was
free
to
return
by
the
night
train
i
had
however
no
mind
to
be
so
businesslike
for
the
scenery
had
clasped
me
tightly
in
its
embrace
and
in
addition
i
found
that
the
resident
medico
had
been
in
my
form
at
marlborough
and
i
was
delighted
to
meet
him
again
i
had
lost
sight
of
him
for
nine
or
ten
years
it
was
by
the
side
of
dr
barnett
that
i
strolled
about
the
grounds
and
learned
something
of
the
history
of
the
curious
old
place
rambling
i
should
think
it
is
rambling
he
said
acquiescing
in
my
remark
how
could
it
be
anything
else
considering
the
piecemeal
way
in
which
it
was
built
it
was
begun
by
a
very
brilliant
and
highly
practical
physician
more
than
fifty
years
ago
when
the
house
as
it
was
then
was
fully
occupied
and
he
got
a
letter
from
a
person
of
quality
inquiring
for
rooms
he
simply
put
the
inquirer
off
for
a
week
then
set
to
built
on
a
few
more
rooms
and
had
them
ready
for
occupation
within
the
time
stated
this
went
on
for
several
years
if
the
lord
lieutenant
had
written
for
a
suite
of
apartments
he
would
have
had
them
ready
in
ten
days
that
sort
of
thing
produces
this
style
of
architecture
st
barter
s
is
the
finest
example
extant
of
the
pure
rambling
but
it
is
the
healthiest
place
in
the
world
people
come
here
expecting
to
die
within
a
fortnight
and
they
live
on
for
thirty
but
now
and
again
there
is
a
death
said
i
what
about
poor
ould
denny
the
most
harmless
crayture
dr
barnett
stared
at
me
was
it
in
the
london
papers
he
cried
oh
i
see
you
have
been
talking
to
the
driver
of
the
car
poor
ould
denny
he
was
everybody
s
and
yet
quite
harmless
the
place
will
never
seem
the
same
to
me
as
it
would
have
done
if
i
had
not
arrived
too
late
to
see
denny
was
he
your
assistant
or
what
the
doctor
laughed
he
was
simply
poor
ould
denny
he
said
that
was
his
profession
it
was
pretty
comprehensive
i
can
tell
you
he
was
here
when
the
house
would
be
overcrowded
with
ten
guests
he
roofed
a
whole
wing
with
his
own
hands
then
he
dug
the
pit
for
the
gasometer
thirty
years
ago
and
he
lived
to
dam
the
trout
stream
that
works
the
dynamo
for
the
electric
light
he
was
also
an
accomplished
and
set
up
the
hatchery
that
supplied
the
stream
with
his
name
should
have
been
crichton
not
callan
anything
else
he
could
do
tricks
on
the
billiard
table
and
he
knew
all
that
there
is
to
be
known
about
is
that
all
that
s
all
no
stay
he
was
a
sculptor
s
model
for
some
time
i
can
show
you
the
result
of
his
labours
in
this
direction
if
you
would
care
to
see
i
certainly
should
care
to
see
come
along
he
led
me
round
the
building
from
where
the
two
storeys
of
the
centre
block
dwindled
away
to
the
single
bedroom
sheds
of
one
wing
we
passed
by
the
side
of
the
terrace
garden
and
i
made
a
remark
respecting
the
fine
carving
on
some
of
the
stone
vases
they
were
the
work
of
the
sculptor
who
chose
denny
for
his
model
said
the
doctor
here
we
i
followed
him
between
two
fine
cedars
and
in
another
instant
we
were
face
to
face
with
a
very
striking
colossal
figure
of
a
man
holding
aloft
a
goblet
the
head
and
the
torso
were
very
powerful
but
the
latter
was
joined
on
to
a
conventional
greek
pedestal
at
the
foot
of
which
there
peeped
out
four
tiny
hoofs
of
satyrs
what
do
you
think
of
it
my
friend
inquired
i
told
him
that
i
thought
there
was
a
good
deal
of
strength
in
the
modelling
of
the
figure
but
i
could
not
understand
the
satyrs
hoofs
i
take
it
for
granted
that
the
sculptor
left
the
hair
unfinished
i
added
for
one
could
not
help
remarking
the
roughness
of
the
masses
at
the
top
of
the
head
the
sculptor
had
merely
blocked
out
the
heavy
locks
of
hair
he
had
made
no
attempt
to
define
them
the
story
of
the
work
is
rather
a
sad
one
said
the
doctor
the
sculptor
was
a
nephew
of
the
man
who
built
this
place
he
had
worked
in
a
good
studio
in
italy
and
was
i
believe
a
pupil
of
the
distinguished
irishman
foley
he
was
devoted
to
his
profession
and
exhibited
in
some
of
the
london
galleries
but
every
one
knows
that
it
is
very
difficult
to
make
a
name
and
a
profit
as
a
sculptor
and
he
realised
this
truth
only
when
he
had
spent
the
greater
part
of
his
small
patrimony
he
came
here
and
built
for
himself
that
cottage
which
you
see
at
the
other
side
of
the
terrace
and
in
order
to
keep
himself
employed
he
carved
all
these
vases
and
urns
which
you
have
been
admiring
unfortunately
however
among
the
doctor
s
patients
at
the
house
there
was
a
wealthy
linen
merchant
from
ulster
one
of
that
vulgar
crowd
who
had
become
suddenly
prosperous
when
the
american
civil
war
prevented
the
export
of
cotton
from
the
southern
ports
and
this
gentleman
meeting
the
sculptor
daily
and
feeling
probably
that
he
would
like
to
pose
before
the
world
as
a
patron
of
art
gave
him
a
commission
to
execute
a
colossal
figure
to
support
a
lamp
at
the
entrance
to
the
new
house
which
he
was
building
for
himself
he
made
no
stipulation
as
to
the
design
only
the
cost
was
not
to
exceed
a
thousand
pounds
and
the
work
was
to
be
ready
within
a
year
of
course
the
poor
sculptor
was
delighted
he
accepted
the
commission
and
thinking
of
the
artistic
rather
than
the
business
side
of
the
transaction
never
dreamt
of
drawing
up
an
agreement
with
his
generous
patron
before
a
month
had
passed
he
had
obtained
his
material
and
made
his
clay
sketches
looking
about
for
a
model
for
the
figure
he
was
struck
by
the
fine
proportions
of
denny
and
had
no
difficulty
in
inducing
him
to
add
to
his
other
occupations
the
more
restful
one
of
a
sculptor
s
model
for
several
months
the
work
progressed
satisfactorily
and
it
was
very
near
its
completion
when
the
model
contracted
a
malady
which
necessitated
the
shaving
of
his
head
and
interrupted
his
sittings
the
sculptor
was
not
greatly
inconvenienced
however
he
turned
his
attention
for
some
weeks
to
the
carving
of
the
pedestal
and
got
that
completed
before
his
model
was
able
to
resume
his
sittings
but
even
then
the
sculptor
could
only
deal
with
the
torso
for
denny
s
crown
was
as
bald
as
an
egg
in
a
couple
of
months
however
the
doctor
assured
him
that
he
would
have
as
luxuriant
a
crop
as
would
qualify
him
to
pose
for
one
of
the
artists
who
produce
the
advertisements
for
the
work
was
now
practically
finished
as
the
model
remarked
the
edifice
only
needed
the
thatch
to
be
put
on
the
roof
to
make
it
presentable
then
the
proud
artist
wrote
to
his
patron
telling
him
that
his
commission
was
executed
and
inviting
him
to
come
and
see
it
after
the
lapse
of
a
week
or
two
the
patron
arrived
and
was
conducted
by
the
sculptor
to
view
his
masterpiece
the
patron
viewed
it
in
silence
for
some
minutes
and
then
burst
into
a
fit
of
laughter
man
dear
he
managed
at
last
to
gasp
in
the
raucous
accent
of
his
native
province
man
dear
what
s
that
thing
anyway
tell
us
what
it
is
if
you
can
a
greek
figure
they
must
have
had
funny
figures
them
greeks
if
they
had
feet
like
yon
you
must
take
me
for
a
queer
fool
if
you
fancy
that
i
d
let
the
like
o
yon
stand
fornenst
my
house
you
may
make
a
fool
of
yourself
as
much
as
you
please
but
i
ll
take
good
care
that
you
don
t
make
a
fool
of
me
what
could
a
refined
man
say
to
a
brute
like
this
well
he
said
nothing
he
stood
there
in
silence
with
his
eyes
fixed
upon
the
face
that
he
had
carved
and
the
patron
left
him
staring
at
it
he
stared
at
it
all
day
and
the
doctor
walking
round
the
garden
that
night
saw
him
staring
at
it
in
the
moonlight
and
led
him
away
to
the
cottage
and
sent
him
to
bed
he
never
rose
from
that
bed
except
once
two
days
later
his
housemaid
entered
his
room
and
found
him
kneeling
at
his
window
the
statue
could
be
seen
where
he
had
placed
it
where
it
now
stands
and
he
was
quite
i
could
not
speak
for
some
time
after
the
doctor
had
told
me
the
story
for
i
felt
that
it
was
the
saddest
i
had
ever
heard
his
heart
was
broken
i
said
but
perhaps
you
will
tell
me
that
science
has
proved
that
such
a
rupture
is
i
will
tell
you
nothing
of
the
sort
said
he
a
broken
heart
is
the
best
possible
way
to
describe
the
effect
upon
a
sensitive
brain
of
such
a
shock
as
the
sculptor
sustained
his
heart
was
broken
i
am
sorry
that
i
hadn
t
a
livelier
story
for
you
people
come
to
ireland
expecting
to
be
amused
but
it
seems
to
me
that
the
history
of
the
island
from
the
earliest
times
is
one
prolonged
lament
the
finest
music
of
the
national
melodies
is
to
be
found
in
the
most
i
stood
with
my
eyes
fixed
upon
the
statue
strange
isn
t
it
that
i
should
arrive
here
to
be
told
that
pitiful
story
within
an
hour
or
two
of
the
death
of
the
model
said
i
the
poor
artist
i
am
sure
that
he
felt
that
he
was
immortalising
denny
and
yet
i
suppose
that
in
a
year
or
two
no
one
will
know
anything
either
of
the
sculptor
or
his
model
perhaps
the
vulgarity
of
the
ulster
patron
is
after
all
the
most
enduring
of
all
the
qualities
that
went
to
the
production
of
this
the
patron
eventually
became
one
of
the
most
distinguished
bankrupts
of
his
generation
said
dr
barnett
he
died
a
few
years
ago
but
vulgarity
did
not
die
with
him
yes
i
think
you
are
right
vulgarity
is
i
wonder
if
our
friend
denny
was
proud
to
be
reproduced
in
the
stone
or
was
he
mortified
at
the
result
of
his
first
connection
with
art
i
remarked
while
we
were
strolling
back
to
the
house
he
took
an
interest
in
the
thing
up
to
the
very
last
replied
the
doctor
i
have
often
seen
him
take
a
surreptitious
glance
at
it
and
pass
away
from
it
stroking
his
head
mournfully
he
confided
in
me
once
that
his
sorrow
was
that
the
sculptor
had
not
lived
to
reproduce
his
fine
head
of
hair
and
i
know
that
he
believed
that
it
was
the
unfinished
state
of
the
crown
of
the
figure
that
brought
about
its
rejection
his
widow
told
me
only
yesterday
that
this
was
the
greatest
trouble
of
his
last
hours
you
see
the
figure
was
a
record
of
his
early
manhood
but
the
pride
that
he
had
in
looking
at
it
must
have
been
chastened
by
the
feeling
that
it
did
not
do
justice
to
his
curls
his
one
vanity
was
his
curly
head
he
was
nicknamed
in
irish
the
it
was
pathetic
to
hear
his
widow
repeat
the
phrase
over
his
body
when
i
visited
her
in
her
trouble
yesterday
he
was
my
boy
my
boy
will
never
know
the
touch
of
my
comb
again
she
wailed
in
poor
old
denny
said
i
that
seems
by
one
consent
to
be
his
most
appropriate
epitaph
said
the
doctor
after
dinner
that
night
i
played
a
very
pleasant
rubber
of
whist
with
my
client
and
the
doctor
and
his
wife
when
the
party
separated
i
went
to
the
with
barnett
and
we
played
a
hundred
up
lighting
a
cigar
then
i
strolled
out
alone
upon
the
terrace
the
doctor
having
gone
to
his
room
the
night
was
a
brilliant
one
and
the
landscape
lay
bare
and
white
beneath
the
moonlight
which
flooded
the
hills
and
spread
a
garment
of
filigree
over
the
foliage
of
the
glen
and
of
the
slope
beyond
beneath
its
brilliance
the
trout
stream
whose
voice
came
fitfully
through
the
brooding
silence
of
the
night
flashed
here
and
there
among
the
trees
the
square
tower
of
the
castle
shone
like
marble
in
the
distance
from
one
of
the
farms
of
the
hillside
the
faint
sound
of
a
dog
s
bark
reached
my
ears
i
seated
myself
on
one
of
the
terrace
chairs
languidly
smoking
my
cigar
and
breathing
the
strong
perfume
of
the
stocks
of
the
garden
i
confess
that
my
mind
was
dwelling
upon
the
story
of
that
queer
piece
of
sculpture
before
which
i
had
stood
in
the
afternoon
it
was
as
sad
a
story
as
that
of
the
poet
keats
only
the
brutal
criticism
of
the
sculptor
s
patron
was
more
savage
than
the
quarterly
review
which
had
bludgeoned
the
fine
poet
to
the
death
but
my
sympathy
was
not
given
to
the
artist
so
fully
as
to
leave
no
pity
to
bestow
upon
his
model
who
had
lived
on
for
thirty
or
forty
years
with
his
humble
grievance
i
could
appreciate
the
feelings
of
poor
old
denny
all
the
years
that
he
had
laboured
beneath
the
burden
of
being
handed
down
in
effigy
to
coming
generations
shorn
of
his
greatest
glory
the
one
who
was
known
to
all
men
as
the
hoy
was
doomed
to
stand
before
the
eyes
of
all
comers
as
the
possessor
of
shapeless
matted
locks
that
were
not
locks
at
all
he
was
not
made
of
the
same
fibre
as
the
artist
he
had
not
broken
down
beneath
the
weight
of
that
reflection
but
i
knew
it
must
have
been
a
heaviness
to
him
all
his
days
i
remained
seated
in
the
moonlight
for
a
long
time
and
just
as
i
thought
that
i
should
turn
in
i
noticed
a
figure
crossing
the
little
grassy
slope
toward
the
garden
it
was
i
perceived
the
figure
of
a
man
and
he
was
wearing
what
i
took
at
first
to
be
an
ordinary
night
suit
of
light
silk
but
before
he
had
gone
a
dozen
steps
i
perceived
that
his
garment
was
a
painter
s
blouse
he
moved
silently
over
the
grass
and
i
could
not
help
feeling
as
i
had
often
done
before
how
a
glance
of
moonlight
on
a
figure
may
produce
such
an
effect
of
mystery
as
can
never
be
gained
in
daylight
i
assumed
that
the
object
which
was
passing
away
among
the
was
one
of
the
household
staff
on
duty
a
watchman
it
might
be
or
a
gardener
going
to
regulate
the
heating
apparatus
in
a
greenhouse
and
yet
looking
at
him
from
my
seat
he
seemed
as
weird
and
unsubstantial
as
a
whiff
of
mountain
mist
i
rose
from
my
place
and
was
about
to
walk
round
to
the
entrance
to
the
house
and
get
to
bed
when
i
became
aware
of
another
figure
moving
through
the
moonlight
along
the
grassy
terrace
i
gave
an
exclamation
of
surprise
when
i
saw
that
this
one
was
half
nude
and
white
white
as
the
stone
of
the
statue
beyond
the
trees
there
it
moved
statue
saw
it
the
figure
of
the
man
with
his
hands
held
aloft
the
features
were
the
same
the
proportions
of
the
body
only
this
one
was
more
perfect
than
the
other
for
he
had
a
mass
of
curly
locks
clustering
over
his
head
like
the
curls
of
the
herakles
of
the
vatican
and
even
while
i
stood
there
watching
him
the
figure
passed
away
among
the
trees
i
waited
in
such
a
state
of
amazement
as
i
had
never
experienced
before
i
had
the
sensation
of
being
newly
awakened
but
i
knew
that
i
had
not
fallen
asleep
for
a
moment
i
was
not
afraid
only
finding
myself
in
a
situation
to
which
i
was
unaccustomed
i
did
not
know
what
i
should
do
it
took
me
some
minutes
to
collect
myself
through
the
stillness
i
became
aware
of
a
curious
dull
tapping
sound
there
it
went
tap
tap
tap
then
a
slight
pause
and
again
tap
tap
tap
tap
a
dog
behind
the
house
gave
a
prolonged
howl
and
along
the
path
below
me
a
which
i
had
seen
during
the
day
scurried
its
tail
between
its
legs
and
every
limb
trembling
tap
tap
tap
a
pause
tap
tap
tap
my
mind
was
made
up
i
went
cautiously
along
the
terrace
in
the
direction
of
the
garden
i
found
myself
walking
stealthily
on
my
toes
as
though
i
was
anxious
not
to
disturb
someone
who
was
desirous
of
quiet
and
as
i
went
on
the
sounds
of
the
tapping
became
more
distinct
almost
before
i
knew
it
i
reached
that
part
of
the
grassy
terrace
which
commanded
a
view
of
the
garden
and
in
an
instant
i
was
standing
still
i
could
hear
the
beating
of
my
own
heart
as
i
saw
under
my
very
eyes
not
twenty
yards
away
three
figures
equally
white
and
shadowy
the
nearest
to
me
was
of
the
man
with
the
head
of
curls
the
one
in
the
middle
was
in
exactly
the
same
posture
it
was
the
figure
of
the
statue
and
the
third
was
the
one
which
i
had
seen
wearing
the
long
white
blouse
and
this
was
the
only
one
of
the
three
that
moved
he
was
standing
as
it
seemed
on
the
ledge
of
the
pedestal
and
a
sculptor
s
chisel
was
in
one
hand
and
a
mallet
in
the
other
he
was
working
at
the
head
of
the
statue
every
now
and
again
glancing
at
the
head
of
the
model
pausing
while
he
did
so
and
beginning
to
work
again
after
the
lapse
of
a
second
or
two
i
stood
there
on
the
terrace
watching
this
strange
scene
and
the
curious
part
of
it
was
that
it
did
not
seem
in
the
least
degree
curious
to
me
while
it
was
being
enacted
on
the
contrary
i
had
a
distinct
sense
of
harmony
of
artistic
finish
the
pleasurable
sensation
of
which
one
is
conscious
on
the
completion
of
the
of
a
symphony
that
is
how
i
can
best
express
what
my
feelings
were
at
the
time
during
the
hour
that
i
remained
there
it
never
occurred
to
me
that
i
should
draw
any
nearer
to
the
shadowy
group
as
a
matter
of
fact
i
believe
that
there
was
uppermost
in
my
mind
an
apprehension
that
it
was
necessary
for
me
to
keep
very
still
lest
i
should
interfere
with
the
work
i
have
had
precisely
the
same
feeling
when
in
the
studio
of
a
painter
while
he
was
at
work
and
i
was
watching
him
but
i
could
not
leave
the
place
where
i
stood
so
long
as
that
scene
was
being
enacted
in
the
silence
and
the
three
figures
were
equally
silent
the
night
knew
no
sound
except
that
caused
by
the
chiselling
of
the
stone
an
hour
must
have
passed
perhaps
more
than
an
hour
and
then
still
in
silence
the
sculptor
threw
his
chisel
and
his
mallet
to
the
ground
i
heard
the
little
thud
which
each
gave
on
the
turf
then
he
sprang
to
the
ground
but
his
feet
made
no
sound
in
alighting
i
stood
on
the
terrace
and
watched
him
and
his
model
move
away
across
the
garden
as
silently
as
they
had
come
and
disappear
among
the
trees
at
the
entrance
to
the
glen
the
next
morning
when
i
had
breakfasted
i
sought
my
friend
dr
barnett
and
told
him
my
experience
of
the
night
he
did
not
smile
but
he
was
strictly
scientific
we
were
smoking
together
on
one
of
the
paths
bordered
by
laurels
and
when
i
had
told
him
all
that
i
had
to
tell
he
put
his
hand
on
my
arm
saying
my
dear
boy
the
phenomena
of
ghosts
are
invariably
interesting
and
on
the
whole
not
more
perplexing
than
other
natural
phenomena
sometimes
they
are
due
to
one
cause
sometimes
to
another
most
frequently
they
must
be
attributed
to
the
projection
of
an
image
upon
the
eye
from
within
not
from
without
now
in
your
case
but
we
had
better
stroll
round
to
the
scene
of
your
we
went
together
across
the
lawn
in
the
direction
of
the
companion
cedars
and
he
continued
his
discourse
all
that
you
have
told
me
interests
me
greatly
showing
as
it
does
how
under
certain
conditions
the
most
admirably
balanced
brain
may
become
what
i
may
call
sensitised
susceptible
as
a
photographic
plate
to
an
image
at
this
point
his
speech
was
arrested
we
had
passed
between
the
cedars
and
the
statue
was
facing
us
the
doctor
was
gazing
up
at
it
good
heavens
he
said
in
a
whisper
he
has
finished
it
i
looked
up
and
saw
that
the
head
of
the
figure
was
covered
with
curls
he
has
finished
it
he
has
finished
it
the
doctor
whispered
again
yes
i
said
he
has
finished
it
i
saw
him
do
black
as
he
is
painted
i
the
houses
which
constitute
the
town
of
picotee
in
the
gambia
region
a
commendable
liberality
of
spirit
prevails
as
to
the
requisite
elements
of
a
town
were
glistening
beneath
the
intolerable
rays
of
the
afternoon
sun
to
the
eyes
of
all
aboard
the
mail
steamer
which
had
just
run
up
a
in
the
anchorage
the
town
seemed
of
dazzling
whiteness
it
was
only
the
inhabitants
of
picotee
who
knew
that
the
walls
of
the
houses
were
not
white
but
of
a
sickly
yellow
tinge
consequently
it
was
only
the
inhabitants
who
knew
how
inappropriate
it
was
to
allude
to
their
town
as
the
whited
sepulchre
a
term
of
reproach
which
was
frequently
levelled
against
it
rather
on
account
of
the
appalling
percentage
of
mortality
among
its
inhabitants
than
by
reason
of
the
spotlessness
of
the
walls
though
they
did
appear
spotless
when
viewed
from
the
sea
in
the
saloon
of
the
the
thermometer
registered
and
when
the
passengers
complained
to
the
captain
of
the
steamer
respecting
the
temperature
holding
him
personally
responsible
for
every
degree
that
it
rose
above
he
pointed
across
the
dazzling
blue
waters
of
the
anchorage
to
where
the
town
was
painfully
glistening
and
asked
his
complainants
how
they
would
like
to
be
there
it
was
universally
believed
that
when
the
captain
had
put
this
inquiry
the
last
word
had
been
said
regarding
the
temperature
he
at
any
rate
seemed
to
fancy
that
he
had
relieved
himself
from
all
responsibility
in
the
matter
at
picotee
things
were
going
on
pretty
much
as
usual
but
what
is
progress
at
picotee
would
be
regarded
as
stagnation
elsewhere
there
was
a
fine
suggestion
of
repose
about
the
kroomen
who
were
dozing
in
unpicturesque
attitudes
in
the
shade
of
the
palms
on
the
ridge
nearest
to
the
beach
and
even
mr
caractacus
brown
who
being
one
of
the
merchants
of
the
place
he
sold
parrots
to
the
sailors
and
would
accept
a
contract
for
green
monkeys
from
the
more
ambitious
collectors
of
the
fauna
of
the
west
coast
was
not
supposed
to
give
way
to
such
weaknesses
as
were
exhibited
by
the
kroomen
even
mr
caractacus
brown
wiped
his
woolly
head
and
admitted
to
his
neighbour
mr
coriolanus
white
that
the
day
was
warm
having
seen
coriolanus
selling
liquid
lard
by
the
spoonful
he
could
scarcely
do
otherwise
than
admit
that
the
temperature
was
high
devonshire
cream
was
solid
in
comparison
with
the
lard
sold
at
picotee
but
in
spite
of
the
heat
a
was
warbling
among
the
bananas
and
its
song
broke
the
monotony
of
the
roar
of
the
great
rollers
that
broke
upon
the
beach
a
roar
that
varies
but
that
never
ends
in
the
ears
of
the
people
of
picotee
dr
claude
koomadhi
who
occupied
a
villa
built
on
the
lovely
green
slope
above
the
town
opened
the
shutters
of
the
room
in
which
he
sat
and
listened
to
the
song
of
the
upon
his
features
which
seemed
as
if
they
were
carved
out
of
black
oak
and
delicately
polished
a
sentimental
expression
appeared
his
eyes
showed
a
large
proportion
of
white
as
he
sighed
and
remarked
to
his
servant
who
brought
him
a
glass
of
iced
cocoanut
milk
that
the
song
of
the
reminded
him
of
home
of
ome
sah
said
the
old
woman
lor
bress
yah
sah
dere
ain
t
no
at
dr
koomadhi
s
eyes
no
longer
wore
a
sentimental
expression
they
flashed
when
the
old
woman
had
spoken
but
she
did
not
notice
this
circumstance
she
only
laid
down
the
tumbler
on
the
table
hitched
up
her
crimson
shawl
and
roared
with
negress
laughter
you
don
t
understand
sally
i
said
home
england
remarked
the
doctor
oh
beg
pardung
sah
thought
yah
looded
to
ashantee
said
the
old
woman
as
she
rolled
out
of
the
room
still
uttering
that
senseless
laugh
dr
koomadhi
did
not
seem
to
be
greatly
put
out
by
that
reminder
of
the
fact
that
ashantee
was
his
birthplace
he
threw
himself
back
in
his
cane
chair
and
took
a
sip
from
the
tumbler
he
then
resumed
his
perusal
of
the
saturday
review
brought
by
the
in
the
morning
he
did
not
get
through
many
pages
he
shook
his
head
gravely
he
could
not
approve
of
the
tone
of
the
political
article
it
suggested
compromise
it
was
not
conservative
enough
for
dr
koomadhi
he
began
to
fear
that
he
must
give
up
the
it
was
clearly
temporising
with
the
enemy
this
would
not
do
for
dr
koomadhi
he
took
another
sip
of
cocoanut
milk
and
then
began
pacing
the
room
he
was
clearly
restless
in
his
mind
but
perhaps
it
would
be
going
too
far
to
suggest
that
he
was
perturbed
owing
to
the
spirit
of
compromise
displayed
in
the
political
article
which
he
had
just
read
no
though
a
staunch
conservative
he
was
still
susceptible
of
a
passion
beyond
the
patriotic
desire
to
assist
in
maintaining
the
integrity
of
the
empire
this
was
the
origin
of
his
uneasiness
he
had
been
awake
all
the
previous
night
thinking
over
his
past
life
and
trying
to
think
out
his
future
the
conclusion
to
which
he
had
come
was
that
as
he
had
successfully
overthrown
all
the
obstacles
which
had
been
in
his
path
to
success
in
the
past
there
was
no
reason
why
he
might
not
overthrow
all
that
might
threaten
to
bar
his
progress
in
the
future
but
in
spite
of
having
come
to
this
conclusion
he
was
very
uneasy
he
did
not
become
more
settled
when
he
had
gone
to
a
drawer
in
his
and
had
taken
out
a
cabinet
portrait
the
portrait
of
a
lady
and
had
gazed
at
it
for
several
minutes
he
laid
it
back
with
something
like
a
sigh
and
then
brought
out
of
the
same
receptacle
a
quantity
of
manuscript
every
page
of
which
consisted
of
a
number
of
lines
irregular
as
to
their
length
but
each
one
beginning
with
a
capital
letter
this
is
the
least
compromising
way
of
referring
to
such
manuscripts
to
say
that
they
were
poetry
would
perhaps
be
to
place
a
fictitious
value
upon
them
but
they
certainly
had
one
feature
in
common
with
the
noblest
poems
ever
written
in
english
every
line
began
with
a
capital
letter
dr
koomadhi
s
lips
they
constituted
not
the
least
prominent
of
his
features
moved
as
he
read
to
himself
the
lines
which
he
had
written
during
the
past
three
months
since
his
return
to
picotee
with
authority
to
spend
some
thousands
of
pounds
in
carrying
out
certain
experiments
the
result
of
which
would
it
was
generally
hoped
transform
the
region
of
the
gambia
into
one
of
the
healthiest
of
her
majesty
s
possessions
then
he
sighed
again
and
laid
the
manuscripts
over
the
photograph
closing
and
locking
the
drawer
of
the
desk
he
walked
fitfully
up
and
down
the
room
for
another
hour
then
he
opened
his
shutters
and
the
first
breath
of
the
evening
breeze
from
the
sea
came
upon
his
face
i
ll
do
it
he
said
resolutely
why
should
i
not
do
it
surely
that
old
ridiculous
prejudice
is
worn
out
surely
she
at
least
will
be
superior
to
such
prejudice
yes
she
must
she
must
i
have
succeeded
hitherto
in
everything
that
i
have
attempted
and
shall
i
fail
in
this
the
roar
of
the
rollers
along
the
beach
filled
the
room
at
the
open
window
of
which
dr
koomadhi
remained
standing
for
several
minutes
ii
dr
koomadhi
belonged
to
a
race
who
are
intolerant
of
any
middle
course
so
far
as
dress
is
concerned
they
are
either
very
much
dressed
or
very
much
undressed
but
he
had
lived
long
enough
in
england
to
have
chastened
whatever
yearning
he
may
have
had
for
running
into
either
extreme
only
now
and
again
usually
when
in
football
costume
he
had
felt
a
strange
longing
to
forswear
the
more
cumbersome
tweeds
of
daily
life
this
longing
combined
with
the
circumstance
of
his
being
extremely
fond
of
football
might
be
accepted
as
evidence
that
the
traditions
of
the
savages
from
whom
he
had
sprung
survived
in
his
nature
just
as
they
do
in
the
youth
of
great
britain
only
he
had
not
to
go
so
far
back
as
have
the
most
of
the
youth
of
great
britain
to
reach
the
the
evening
attire
which
he
now
resumed
was
wholly
white
from
his
pith
helmet
down
to
his
canvas
shoes
he
was
in
white
with
the
exception
of
his
tie
which
was
black
he
looked
at
himself
in
a
glass
when
at
the
point
of
leaving
his
house
and
he
felt
satisfied
with
his
appearance
only
he
should
have
dearly
liked
to
exchange
his
black
tie
for
one
of
scarlet
he
could
not
understand
how
it
was
that
he
had
never
passed
a
draper
s
window
in
london
without
staring
with
envious
eyes
at
the
crimson
scarves
displayed
for
sale
no
one
could
know
what
heroic
sacrifices
he
made
in
rejecting
all
such
allurements
no
one
could
know
what
he
suffered
while
crushing
down
that
uncivilised
longing
for
a
brilliant
colour
just
before
leaving
the
house
he
went
to
his
desk
and
brought
out
of
one
of
the
drawers
a
small
ivory
box
he
unlocked
it
and
stood
for
some
time
with
his
face
down
to
the
thing
that
the
box
contained
a
stone
somewhat
resembling
a
human
ear
while
keeping
his
head
down
to
this
thing
his
lips
were
moving
he
was
clearly
murmuring
some
phrases
in
a
strange
language
into
that
curiously
shaped
stone
relocking
the
ivory
box
he
returned
it
to
the
drawer
which
he
also
locked
then
he
left
his
house
and
took
a
path
leading
to
a
villa
standing
in
front
of
a
with
a
tall
before
its
hall
door
a
from
which
the
fluttered
indicating
to
all
casual
visitors
that
this
was
the
official
residence
of
her
majesty
s
commissioner
to
the
gambia
commander
hope
hallo
koomadhi
came
a
voice
from
the
open
window
to
the
right
of
the
door
pardon
me
for
five
minutes
i
m
engaged
at
my
correspondence
to
go
to
england
by
the
this
evening
but
don
t
mind
me
go
through
to
the
and
my
daughter
will
give
you
a
cup
of
all
right
sir
said
dr
koomadhi
don
t
hurry
on
my
account
i
was
merely
calling
to
mention
that
i
had
forwarded
my
report
early
in
the
day
but
i
ll
wait
all
right
came
the
voice
from
the
window
i
m
at
the
last
dr
koomadhi
was
in
the
act
of
entering
the
porch
when
his
pith
helmet
was
snatched
off
by
some
unseen
hand
and
a
curious
shriek
sounded
on
the
balcony
above
the
porch
the
ruffian
said
koomadhi
with
a
laugh
the
ruffian
he
s
at
his
tricks
he
took
a
few
steps
back
and
looked
up
to
the
balcony
there
sat
an
immense
tame
baboon
wearing
the
helmet
and
screeching
with
merriment
i
ll
have
to
give
you
another
lesson
my
gentleman
said
the
doctor
shaking
his
finger
at
the
creature
hand
me
down
that
helmet
at
the
baboon
made
a
grimace
and
then
raised
his
right
hand
to
the
salute
his
favourite
trick
suddenly
the
doctor
produced
a
sound
with
his
lips
and
in
an
instant
the
monkey
had
dropped
the
helmet
and
had
fled
in
alarm
from
the
balcony
to
the
roof
of
the
house
whence
he
gazed
in
every
direction
while
the
doctor
went
into
the
house
with
his
helmet
in
his
hand
he
had
merely
given
the
simian
word
of
alarm
which
the
creature
understanding
its
mother
tongue
had
promptly
acted
upon
you
may
break
you
may
shatter
the
vase
if
you
will
but
the
scent
you
know
the
rest
sir
remarked
mr
letts
the
commissioner
s
secretary
who
had
observed
from
his
window
the
whole
transaction
what
was
that
letts
asked
the
commissioner
koomadhi
spoke
to
the
baboon
in
its
own
tongue
sir
and
it
took
the
hint
of
a
man
and
a
brother
and
cleared
yes
but
where
does
the
shattering
of
the
vase
come
in
asked
the
commissioner
i
mean
to
suggest
that
a
nigger
remains
a
nigger
and
remains
on
speaking
terms
with
a
baboon
even
though
he
has
a
college
degree
and
wears
tweeds
said
mr
letts
oh
said
the
commissioner
he
had
heard
the
same
opinion
expressed
by
various
members
of
his
staff
ever
since
he
had
anything
to
do
with
the
administration
of
affairs
on
the
west
coast
he
had
long
ago
ceased
to
take
even
the
smallest
amount
of
interest
in
the
question
of
the
exact
depth
of
a
negro
s
veneer
of
civilisation
iii
but
while
mr
letts
was
quoting
thomas
moore
s
line
in
a
corrupt
form
to
the
commissioner
dr
koomadhi
was
accepting
with
a
certain
amount
of
dignity
the
greeting
which
was
extended
to
him
by
miss
hope
the
commissioner
s
daughter
in
the
she
had
been
trying
over
some
songs
which
had
just
arrived
from
england
two
of
them
were
of
a
high
colour
of
sentimentalism
another
belonged
to
that
form
of
poetic
composition
known
as
a
coon
song
it
had
a
banjo
obbligato
but
the
pianoforte
accompaniment
of
itself
gave
more
than
a
suggestion
of
the
twanging
of
strings
and
the
banging
of
a
tambourine
had
dr
koomadhi
arrived
a
few
minutes
sooner
it
would
have
been
his
privilege
to
hear
gertrude
hope
chant
the
chorus
don
t
you
belieb
un
massa
john
jes
winkie
mid
y
o
eye
kick
up
yo
heels
to
de
gasalier
say
how

dat
for

but
gertrude
had
after
singing
the
melody
pushed
the
copy
under
a
pile
of
music
and
had
risen
from
the
piano
to
receive
her
visitor
at
the
same
time
ringing
for
tea
he
apologised
for
interrupting
her
at
the
piano
if
i
had
only
known
that
you
were
singing
i
should
certainly
have
well
not
exactly
stayed
away
no
i
should
have
come
sooner
and
remained
a
worshipper
in
the
outer
oh
i
wasn
t
singing
not
regularly
singing
said
she
with
a
laugh
trying
over
stupid
songs
about
lovers
partings
is
not
singing
dr
lovers
partings
said
he
they
seem
particularly
well
adapted
to
lyrical
the
songs
at
any
rate
are
said
she
they
represent
the
most
acute
stage
of
the
lovers
feelings
then
said
he
i
daresay
i
suppose
there
are
degrees
of
feelings
even
of
i
m
sure
of
it
miss
he
was
seated
in
a
wicker
chair
she
had
thrown
herself
into
another
a
seat
that
gave
her
the
appearance
of
lying
in
a
hammock
he
scanned
her
from
her
white
forehead
down
to
the
dainty
feet
that
crossed
one
another
on
the
sloping
support
of
she
would
have
been
looked
on
as
a
very
pretty
girl
in
a
london
and
even
a
girl
who
would
be
regarded
as
commonplace
there
would
pass
as
a
marvel
of
loveliness
on
the
west
coast
of
africa
yes
continued
dr
koomadhi
i
m
sure
there
are
degrees
of
feeling
even
among
you
are
a
doctor
and
so
doubtless
have
had
many
opportunities
of
diagnosing
the
disease
in
all
its
stages
said
she
yes
i
am
a
doctor
said
he
i
am
also
a
man
i
have
felt
i
she
gave
another
laugh
a
complete
conjugation
of
the
verb
said
she
past
and
present
tenses
how
about
the
future
there
was
only
a
little
pause
before
he
said
the
future
is
in
your
hands
miss
hope
i
have
come
here
to
tell
you
that
i
have
never
loved
any
one
in
all
my
life
but
you
and
to
ask
you
if
you
will
marry
there
was
now
a
long
pause
so
long
that
he
became
hopeful
of
her
answer
then
he
saw
the
blank
look
that
was
upon
her
face
change
he
saw
the
flush
that
came
over
her
white
face
when
she
had
had
time
to
realise
the
import
of
his
words
she
started
up
and
at
the
same
instant
the
baboon
came
in
front
of
the
window
and
raised
his
right
hand
to
the
salute
you
are
mad
mad
she
said
in
a
whisper
that
had
something
fierce
about
it
then
she
lay
back
in
her
chair
with
a
laugh
marry
you
i
should
as
soon
marry
she
had
pointed
to
the
baboon
before
she
had
checked
herself
you
would
as
soon
marry
the
baboon
as
me
said
he
in
a
low
and
laboured
voice
i
did
not
say
that
although
dr
koomadhi
what
you
have
told
me
has
given
me
a
shock
such
a
shock
as
i
have
never
had
before
i
am
not
myself
if
i
said
anything
hurtful
to
you
i
know
that
you
will
attribute
it
to
the
shock
i
ask
your
pardon
sincerely
humbly
i
never
thought
it
possible
that
you
you
oh
you
must
have
been
mad
you
give
me
a
cup
of
tea
my
dearest
if
you
don
t
want
to
see
me
perish
before
your
the
words
came
from
outside
a
window
behind
dr
koomadhi
and
in
another
second
a
man
had
entered
from
the
verandah
and
had
given
a
low
whistle
on
perceiving
that
miss
hope
had
a
visitor
come
along
said
miss
hope
when
she
had
drawn
a
deep
breath
come
along
and
be
introduced
to
dr
koomadhi
you
have
often
heard
of
dr
koomadhi
i
m
sure
dick
dr
koomadhi
this
is
major
how
do
you
do
said
the
stranger
giving
his
hand
to
the
doctor
i
m
glad
to
meet
you
i
ve
heard
a
lot
about
you
and
how
clever
you
you
flatter
me
said
dr
koomadhi
shaking
hands
with
the
i
must
now
rush
away
miss
hope
he
added
i
only
called
to
tell
your
father
that
i
had
forwarded
some
reports
by
the
jolly
old
tub
the
glad
i
ve
seen
the
last
of
her
said
major
minton
major
minton
arrived
by
the
this
morning
said
gertrude
must
you
really
go
away
dr
koomadhi
not
even
the
prospect
of
a
cup
of
your
tea
would
make
me
swerve
from
the
path
of
duty
miss
hope
said
the
doctor
with
a
smile
so
chastened
as
to
be
deprived
of
all
its
ethiopian
character
he
shook
hands
gracefully
with
her
and
major
minton
and
passed
out
by
the
verandah
the
baboon
standing
to
one
side
and
solemnly
saluting
the
major
was
the
only
one
who
laughed
and
his
laugh
was
a
roar
iv
dr
koomadhi
found
waiting
for
him
at
his
house
his
old
friend
mr
ross
the
surgeon
of
the
he
had
been
unable
to
leave
the
steamer
earlier
in
the
day
and
he
had
only
an
hour
to
spend
ashore
no
he
did
not
think
that
anything
was
the
matter
with
a
bottle
of
champagne
provided
that
it
was
large
enough
and
dry
enough
and
that
it
had
been
plunged
into
ice
not
ice
plunged
into
it
these
essentials
being
guaranteed
by
dr
koomadhi
mr
ross
s
hour
passed
as
he
thought
pleasantly
enough
the
two
men
sat
together
on
cane
chairs
on
the
balcony
facing
the
sea
it
is
at
such
a
time
and
under
such
conditions
that
existence
on
the
gambia
becomes
not
merely
endurable
but
absolutely
delightful
mr
ross
made
a
remark
to
this
effect
and
expressed
the
opinion
that
his
friend
was
in
luck
in
luck
oh
yes
i
m
the
luckiest
fellow
in
the
world
responded
koomadhi
grimly
i
ve
everything
that
heart
can
wish
yes
you
re
well
paid
you
don
t
mind
the
climate
and
you
re
honoured
and
respected
by
the
whole
community
said
ross
of
course
honoured
and
respected
that
s
the
strong
point
of
the
situation
said
koomadhi
the
only
drawback
seems
to
me
to
be
the
rather
narrow
limits
of
the
society
still
the
commissioner
is
a
decent
enough
sort
of
old
boy
and
letts
has
a
good
deal
to
recommend
him
by
the
way
you
ll
not
be
so
badly
off
in
this
matter
during
the
next
six
months
as
you
have
been
we
brought
out
a
chap
named
minton
a
chap
that
any
one
could
get
on
with
he
s
just
chucked
the
service
and
is
going
to
marry
miss
i
have
just
met
him
at
the
residency
said
koomadhi
filling
up
with
a
steady
hand
the
glass
of
his
guest
and
so
he
s
going
to
marry
miss
hope
is
he
yes
he
confided
a
lot
in
me
mostly
on
the
bridge
toward
the
hour
of
midnight
the
young
woman
has
been
engaged
to
him
for
a
year
past
they
met
just
before
the
commissioner
got
his
berth
but
the
daughter
being
a
good
daughter
and
with
a
larger
sense
of
duty
than
is
possessed
by
most
girls
swore
in
her
own
way
of
course
that
nothing
should
tempt
her
to
desert
her
father
for
at
least
a
year
much
to
minton
s
disgust
as
you
can
understand
she
came
out
here
telling
him
that
if
he
still
was
anxious
to
marry
her
he
might
follow
her
at
the
end
of
a
year
well
as
he
retained
his
fancy
he
came
out
with
us
and
i
believe
you
ll
be
in
a
position
to
add
an
official
wedding
to
your
other
experiences
that
s
something
to
look
forward
to
said
koomadhi
but
how
will
that
incident
improve
society
in
this
neighbourhood
i
suppose
minton
and
his
wife
will
get
off
to
england
as
soon
as

they
although
they
are

married
at
once
they
are
to
remain
here
for
six
or
seven
months
until
in
fact

commissioner
gets
his
leave

minton
has
a
trifle
of
six
thousand
and
a
free
house
in
yorkshire
so
miss
hope
is
in
luck
so
for
that
matter
is
minton
she
s
a
fine
young
woman
i
believe
i
only
met
her
i
m
not
so
certain
about
her
constitution
said
koomadhi
her
lungs
are
i
believe
all
right
but
her
circulation
is
defective
and
she
suffers
from
headaches
just
when
she
should
be
at
her
oh
hang

all
a

a
girl
for
a
that
cried
ross
your
circulation
s
defective
koomadhi
if
you
re
capable
only
of
judging
a
girl
by
the
stethoscope
you
re
too
much
absorbed
in
your
profession
that
s
what
s
the
matter
with
i
daresay
you
are
right
koomadhi
admitted
after
a
pause
of
a
few
seconds
in
the
course
of
the
next
several
other
topics
in
addition
to
the
matrimonial
prospects
of
major
minton
and
the
constitutional
shortcomings
of
miss
hope
were
discussed
on
the
verandah
until
at
length
the
sound
of
the
of
the
was
borne
by
the
breeze
that
s
a
message
to
me
said
ross
starting
up
come
down
to
the
shore
and
see
the
last
of
me
for
three
months
at
any
dr
koomadhi
put
on
his
helmet
and
saw
his
friend
safely
through
the
surf
on
his
way
to
where
the
steamer
was
swinging
at
her
anchor
the
sun
had
set
before
he
returned
to
his
house
to
dinner
and
before
he
had
risen
from
the
table
a
message
came
to
him
that
one
of
the
officers
of
the
houssas
was
anxious
to
see
him
being
threatened
with
an
attack
of
fever
the
great
stars
were
burning
overhead
before
he
returned
from
the
barrack
of
the
houssas
and
was
able
to
throw
off
his
coat
and
lie
back
in
his
chair
in
his
own
he
had
a
good
deal
to
think
about
before
going
to
his
bedroom
and
he
seemed
to
find
the
darkness
congenial
with
his
thoughts
in
fact
the
negro
acknowledged
a
sort
of
brotherhood
in
the
night
and
he
remained
for
some
hours
in
that
fraternal
darkness
it
was
just
midnight
when
he
went
with
only
a
small
amount
of
groping
to
his
desk
and
took
out
of
its
drawer
the
ivory
box
containing
the
earshaped
stone
into
whose
orifice
he
had
spoken
some
words
before
leaving
for
the
commissioner
s
house
in
the
afternoon
he
unlocked
the
box
and
removed
the
stone
he
left
his
villa
taking
the
stone
with
him
and
strolled
once
more
to
the
house
which
he
had
visited
a
few
hours
before
lights
were
in
the
windows
of
the
residency
and
certain
musical
sounds
were
coming
from
the
room
where
he
had
been
with
the
twanging
of
the
banjo
there
came
the
sound
of
a
light
bass
voice
of
no
particular
timbre
chanting
the
words
of
the
latest
plantation
melody

dr
koomadhi
listened
while
three
stanzas
of
the
doggerel
were
being
sung
by
major
minton
then
he
raised
the
stone
that
was
in
the
hollow
of
his
hand
and
whispered
some
words
into
it
as
he
had
done
in
the
afternoon
in
a
second
the
song
stopped
although
the
singer
was
in
the
middle
of
a
stanza
confound
it
all
cried
major
minton
koomadhi
heard
his
voice
distinctly
one
of
my
strings
is
broken
i
suppose
it
was
the
sudden
change
of
atmosphere
that
made
it
give
way
it
s
a
good
bit
drier
here
than
aboard
the
the
concert
is
over
for
came
the
voice
of
the
commissioner
it
s
about
time
for
all
of
us
to
be
in
our
that
s
my
notion
too
said
letts
those
who
object
can
have
their
money
returned
at
the
it
was
strange
that
breaking
of
the
string
without
warning
dr
koomadhi
heard
gertrude
say
he
smiled
it
was
only
at
midnight
in
the
open
air
and
when
he
was
alone
that
he
allowed
himself
the
luxury
of
an
unbridled
smile
he
knew
the
weaknesses
of
his
race
he
put
the
stone
into
the
pocket
of
his
coat
and
returned
to
his
house
the
marriage
of
major
minton
to
miss
hope
took
place
in
another
week
of
course
the
ceremony
was
performed
by
the
lord
bishop
of
bonny
who
was
also
metropolitan
of
the
gambia
and
senegal
the
gunboat
that
was
at
the
anchorage
displayed
every
available
rag
of
bunting
and
the
lieutenant
who
commanded
her
said
he
would
gladly
have
fired
a
salute
in
honour
of
the
event
only
for
the
fact
that
the
admiralty
made
him
accountable
for
every
ounce
of
powder
that
he
burned
and
in
addition
for
the
wear
and
tear
on
every
gun
the
guns
didn
t
bear
much
tampering
with
and
there
was
nothing
so
bad
for
them
as
firing
them
it
wore
them
out
the
admiralty
stated
and
the
practice
must
be
put
a
stop
to
but
if
there
was
no
official
burning
of
powder
to
mark
the
happy
event
there
was
a
great
deal
of
it
that
was
unofficial
and
wholly
irregular
dr
koomadhi
spent
several
hours
of
the
afternoon
amputating
fingers
of
krooboys
that
had
been
mutilated
through
an
imperfect
acquaintance
on
the
part
of
the
native
populace
with
the
properties
of
gunpowder
when
ignited
an
eye
or
two
were
reported
to
be
missing
and
in
the
cool
of
the
evening
the
doctor
had
brought
to
him
by
a
conscientious
townsman
a
human
ear
for
which
no
owner
could
be
found
the
happy
pair
went
to
the
canary
islands
for
their
honeymoon
and
returned
radiant
at
the
end
of
six
weeks
and
the
commissioner
s
which
had
suffered
materially
through
the
absence
of
the
commissioner
s
daughter
was
restored
in
all
its
former
perfection
every
night
varied
strains
of
melody
floated
to
the
ears
of
such
persons
as
were
in
the
neighbourhood
of
the
residency
and
it
was
a
fact
that
major
minton
s
banjo
never
twanged
without
attracting
an
audience
of
from
ten
to
five
hundred
of
the
negro
population
of
picotee
the
pathway
was
every
night
paved
with
negroes
who
listened
shoulder
to
shoulder
and
kneecap
to
kneecap
they
sat
upon
their
haunches
to
the
fascinating
songs
they
felt
that
if
the
commissioner
had
only
introduced
a
obbligato
to
the
melodies
the
artistic
charm
of
the
performance
would
be
complete
the
native
evangelist
who
occasionally
contrived
to
fill
a
schoolhouse
with
young
christians
by
the
aid
of
a
harmonium
a
wheezy
asthmatic
instrument
which
in
spite
of
a
long
lifetime
spent
on
the
west
coast
had
never
become
fully
acclimatised
felt
that
his
success
was
seriously
jeopardised
by
the
major
s
secular
melodies
when
the
flock
were
privileged
to
hear
such
fascinating
music
unconditionally
he
knew
that
it
was
unreasonable
to
expect
them
to
be
regular
in
their
attendance
at
the
schoolhouse
where
the
harmonium
wheezed
only
after
certain
religious
services
had
been
forced
on
them
he
wondered
if
the
bishop
might
be
approached
on
the
subject
of
introducing
the
banjo
into
the
schoolhouse
services
he
believed
that
with
such
auxiliaries
as
the
banjo
and
perhaps
but
this
was
optional
the
bones
a
large
evangelistic
work
might
be
done
in
the
outlying
districts
of
picotee
dr
koomadhi
had
always
been
a
frequent
visitor
at
the
residence
but
for
some
time
after
the
marriage
of
the
commissioner
s
daughter
he
was
not
quite
so
often
to
be
found
in
the
of
an
evening
gradually
however
he
increased
the
number
of
his
weekly
visits
he
was
the
only
person
in
the
neighbourhood
who
could
occasionally
beat
major
minton
at
billiards
and
this
fact
helped
in
a
large
measure
to
overcome
the
prejudice
which
major
minton
frankly
admitted
to
his
wife
he
entertained
against
the
native
races
of
west
africa
major
minton
was
becoming
a
as
any
active
person
who
understands
the
game
is
likely
to
become
after
a
few
months
residence
at
a
west
coast
settlement
dr
koomadhi
is
a
gentleman
and
a
christian
mrs
minton
remarked
one
day
when
mr
letts
the
secretary
had
challenged
discussion
upon
his
favourite
topic
namely
the
thinness
of
the
veneer
of
civilisation
upon
the
most
civilised
savage
he
s
a
i
admit
said
letts
a
man
who
plays
so
straight
a
game
of
billiards
can
t
be
far
wrong
remarked
major
minton
i
have
reasons
the
best
of
reasons
for
knowing
that
dr
koomadhi
is
a
forgiving
christian
gentleman
said
gertrude
yes
he
shall
always
be
my
she
had
not
forgiven
herself
for
that
terrible
sentence
i
would
as
soon
marry
she
had
not
forgiven
herself
for
having
glanced
at
the
baboon
as
she
checked
the
words
that
sprang
from
her
almost
involuntarily
but
dr
koomadhi
was
showing
day
by
day
that
he
had
forgiven
them
and
thus
it
was
she
felt
that
he
was
worthy
to
be
regarded
by
all
men
as
a
gentleman
and
a
christian
vi
a
few
days
later
dr
koomadhi
was
visited
by
major
minton
the
major
was
anxious
to
have
some
shooting
at
big
game
and
he
was
greatly
disappointed
at
being
unable
to
find
in
the
neighbourhood
of
picotee
any
one
who
could
put
him
on
the
right
track
to
gratify
his
longing
for
slaughter
the
did
not
find
an
outlet
for
their
business
at
picotee
and
the
majority
of
the
inhabitants
were
as
unenterprising
major
minton
said
as
the
of
an
english
village
nay
more
so
for
the
chawbacons
were
beginning
to
know
the
joy
of
a
metropolitan
music
hall
and
that
meant
enterprise
he
wondered
if
koomadhi
would
allow
him
to
accompany
him
on
his
next
excursion
inland
koomadhi
said
that
no
proposal
could
give
him
greater
pleasure
he
would
be
going
up
again
in
a
week
or
two
and
he
could
promise
major
minton
some
sport
he
could
show
him
some
queer
things
talking
of
queer
things
had
major
minton
ever
seen
a
piece
of
the
famous
african
it
was
supposed
that
the
famous
statue
of
memnon
had
been
carved
out
of
that
stone
major
minton
had
considered
all
that
had
been
written
on
the
subject
of
the
talking
statue
utter
rot
and
he
believed
so
still
could
any
sane
man
credit
a
story
like
that
he
was
anxious
to
know
i
suppose
not
said
koomadhi
but
anyhow
i
have
now
and
again
come
upon
pieces
of
the
i
ll
show
you
a
couple
of
he
produced
the
roughly
cut
stone
ear
and
then
an
equally
rough
stone
chipped
into
the
form
of
a
mouth
a
negro
s
mouth
they
are
rum
things
to
be
sure
said
minton
i
don
t
think
that
i
ever
saw
stones
just
the
same
is
the
material
marble
i
haven
t
the
least
idea
said
koomadhi
but
just
put
that
stone
to
your
ear
for
a
few
minton
had
the
in
his
hand
koomadhi
retained
the
and
put
it
to
his
lips
the
moment
that
the
major
raised
his
hand
no
said
the
major
i
hear
nothing
that
myth
isn
t
good
enough
for
me
i
m
not
exactly
a
lunatic
yet
and
that
s
why
i
m
going
to
climb
up
to
your
roof
to
enjoy
the
take
your
marvellous
and
i
ll
show
you
what
it
is
to
be
a
he
opened
the
shutters
got
out
upon
the
verandah
and
began
climbing
one
of
the
supports
of
the
verandah
roof
he
was
a
pretty
fair
athlete
but
when
the
thermometer
registers
is
not
perhaps
the
most
favourable
time
for
violent
exercise
still
he
reached
the
roof
with
his
hands
and
threw
one
leg
up
in
another
moment
he
was
sitting
on
the
highest
part
of
the
roof
and
was
inviting
koomadhi
to
join
him
declaring
that
only
a
fool
would
remain
indoors
on
such
a
day
koomadhi
smiled
and
shook
his
head
you
must
have
some
refreshment
after
your
exertions
said
he
what
would
you
like
a
with
a
lump
of
ice
clinking
the
sides
of
the
tumbler
that
sounds
inviting
said
major
minton
scratching
his
chest
with
a
forefinger
it
had
apparently
been
chafed
in
his
ascent
of
the
roof
yes
but
if
you
chance
to
have
a
banana
and
a
few
nuts
by
jingo
i
should
like
a
nut
or
two
has
no
dietist
written
a
paper
on
the
dietetic
value
of
the
common
or
garden
nut
koomadhi
come
down
and
i
ll
give
you
as
many
nuts
as
you
can
eat
said
koomadhi
yes
i
ll
come
down
this
way
said
the
major
he
swung
himself
by
one
arm
from
the
side
of
the
roof
to
the
bough
of
a
tree
there
he
hung
suspended
by
the
other
arm
and
swinging
slowly
backward
and
forward
even
then
he
scraped
the
breast
of
his
shirt
uttering
a
number
of
sounds
that
might
have
meant
laughter
then
he
caught
a
lower
branch
with
his
loose
arm
and
dropped
to
the
ground
again
he
scraped
at
his
chest
and
laughed
how
about
those
nuts
he
said
i
think
i
ve
earned
them
how
the
mischief
is
it
that
i
neglected
my
gymnastics
all
these
months
what
a
fool
i
was
walking
along
in
the
open
day
by
day
when
i
might
have
been
enjoying
the
free
life
of
the
jungle
come
inside
and
try
a
bit
of
cocoanut
said
koomadhi
i
m
your
man
said
the
major
my
man
man
laughed
the
doctor
oh
yes
you
ve
earned
the
the
soft
flesh
of
a
green
cocoanut
lay
on
the
table
of
the
and
major
minton
caught
it
up
and
swallowed
it
without
ceremony
the
doctor
watched
him
with
a
curious
expression
on
his
face
that
s
the
most
refreshing
tiffin
i
ve
had
for
a
long
time
said
the
major
now
i
ll
have
to
get
back
to
the
residency
will
you
drop
in
for
a
game
of
billiards
perhaps
i
may
said
the
doctor
take
that
again
and
try
if
you
really
can
not
hear
anything
when
you
put
it
to
your
my
dear
fellow
i
m
not
the
sort
of
a
chap
to
become
the
victim
of
a
delusion
said
the
major
picking
up
the
stone
and
holding
it
to
his
ear
not
a
sound
do
i
hear
hang
it
all
man
i
d
get
more
sound
out
of
a
common
shell
he
had
his
eyes
fixed
upon
the
that
stood
on
the
desk
beside
a
blotter
and
a
sheet
of
dr
koomadhi
noticed
the
expression
in
his
eyes
and
turned
to
open
the
door
the
very
instant
that
his
back
was
turned
major
minton
ran
to
the
upset
it
upon
the
blotter
and
then
rushed
off
by
the
open
window
laughing
heartily
and
yet
there
was
no
human
being
who
so
detested
the
playing
of
practical
jokes
as
major
minton
dr
koomadhi
put
away
the
stones
and
called
his
servant
to
wipe
up
the
ink
which
was
dripping
down
to
the
floor
lorramussy
cried
the
old
woman
how
eber
did
yo
make
dat
muss
i
didn
t
know
that
it
was
on
the
blotter
until
too
late
said
he
and
yet
dr
koomadhi
was
a
most
truthful
man
for
a
doctor
vii
hullo
said
letts
what
have
you
been
doing
to
yourself
major
minton
had
thrown
himself
into
the
secretary
s
cosiest
chair
on
his
return
from
visiting
dr
koomadhi
and
was
wiping
his
forehead
i
ve
been
doing
more
to
myself
than
i
should
have
done
replied
minton
for
heaven
s
sake
ring
for
a
a
that
s
an
extreme
measure
said
letts
but
you
look
as
if
you
needed
he
went
to
his
own
cupboard
and
produced
the
brandy
and
then
rang
the
bell
for
the
which
was
of
course
kept
in
the
refrigerator
then
he
looked
curiously
at
the
man
in

when
his

much
out

i
had
fallen

laugh
by
george
letts
that
tear
in
my
knee
does
suggest
a
but
how
on
earth
did
it
come
about
asked
letts
surely
you
should
know
better
than
to
go
for
a
nigger
as
you
would
for
a
christian
why
the
mischief
didn
t
you
kick
him
on
the
shins
and
then
put
your
knee
into
his
face
give
me
the
the
secretary
handed
him
the
tumbler
containing
a
stiff
peg
and
he
drained
it
without
giving
any
evidence
of
dissatisfaction
now
how
did
it
come
about
inquired
letts
i
hope
you
haven
t
dragged
us
into
the
business
if
you
have
there
ll
be
a
question
asked
about
it
in
the
house
of
commons
by
one
of
those
busybodies
who
have
no
other
way
of
proving
to
their
constituents
that
they
re
in
attendance
mr
jones
asked
the
secretary
of
state
for
the
colonies
if
he
had
any
information
to
give
to
the
house
regarding
an
alleged
outrage
by
a
white
man
closely
associated
with
the
family
of
her
majesty
s
commissioner
at
picotee
upon
a
native
or
natives
of
that
that

how
it
will
read
then
there
ll
be

leaders
in
those
papers
that
deal
with
justices

boy
who
gets
a
month
s
imprisonment
for
stealing
a
turnip
you
know
that
sort
of
keep
your
hair
on
said
minton
there
ll
be
no
show
in
the
house
about
this
there
has
been
no
row
i
went
round
to
koomadhi
s
and
when
we
were
talking
together
i
suddenly
fancied
that
the
day
was
just
one
for
a
gymnastic
display
i
don
t
know
whether
it
was
that
polite
manner
of
koomadhi
s
or
something
else
set
me
off
but
i
felt
an
irresistible
impulse
to
bounce
without
waiting
to
take
off
my
coat
i
went
out
on
the
verandah
and
hauled
myself
up
to
the
roof
i
don
t
know
how
i
did
it
i
might
have
managed
it
ten
years
ago
when
i
was
in
condition
but
considering
how
far
off
colour
i
am
just
now
by
george
i
don
t
know
how
i
managed
it
anyhow
i
did
manage
at
some
trifling
cost
said
letts
and
what
did
you
do
on
the
roof
when
you
got
there
well
i
swung
myself
down
again
but
i
seemed
to
have
a
notion
in
the
meantime
that
that
nice
nigger
would
try
to
climb
up
beside
me
and
i
know
that
i
had
an
impulse
to
catch
him
by
the
tail
the
tail
of
his
coat
of
course
and
swing
him
through
the
but
he
didn
t
make
such
an
ass
of
himself
as
to
go
through
some
gymnastics
and
the
thermometer
standing
a
degree
or
two
under
a
hundred
well
you
ve
got
off
well
this
time
minton
but
don
t
do
it
again
that
s
i
tell
you
it
was
an
impulse
a
curious
oh
impulses
like
that
don
t
come
to
chaps
who
have
their
wits
about
i
suppose
it
was
a
bit
of
bounding
after
all
but
somehow
well
you
wouldn
t
just
call
me
a
bounder
would
you
letts
why
shouldn
t
i
call
you
a
bounder
i
d
like
to
know
a
bounder
is
one
who
bounds
isn
t
he
well
i
suppose
but
i
give
you
my
word
i
felt
at
that
moment
that
it
was
the
most
natural
thing
i
could
have
done
climbing
up
to
the
roof
of
the
verandah
and
then
and
then
swinging
down
again
i
he
was
afraid
to
tell
letts
of
that
practical
joke
which
he
had
played
off
on
koomadhi
when
he
found
that
the
doctor
did
not
lend
himself
to
that
subtle
piece
of
jocularity
which
minton
said
he
had
conceived
when
sitting
on
the
roof
of
the
verandah
letts
had
been
pretty
hard
on
him
for
having
gone
so
far
as
to
climb
up
to
the
roof
but
what
would
he
have
said
if
he
had
been
told
about
that
incident
minton
thought
it
would
on
the
whole
be
doing
himself
more
ample
justice
if
he
were
to
withhold
from
letts
all
information
regarding
that
business
he
said
nothing
about
it
and
when
letts
mumbled
something
when
in
the
act
of
lighting
a
cigar
something
about
fellows
who
behave
like
idiots
going
home
and
giving
the
whole
west
coast
a
bad
name
whereas
properly
treated
the
climate
was
one
of
the
most
salubrious
he
remarked
confidentially
i
say
old
chap
you
needn
t
mind
jawing
to
the
missus
or
the
governor
about
this
business
it
s
not
worth
talking
about
you
know
but
they
re
both
given
to
exaggerate
the
importance
of
such
things
gertrude
especially
i
m
a
bit
afraid
of
her
still
i
admit
we
ve
only
been
married
about
three
months
you
ll
great
duke
here
s
a
chap
who
fancies
that
as
time
goes
on
he
ll
get
less
afraid
of
his
wife
cried
letts
well
well
some
chaps
do
get
hallucinations
early
in
don
t
say
a
word
about
it
letts
where
s
the
good
of
making
a
poor
girl
uneasy
where
indeed
but
why
poor
girl
because
she
s
liable
to
be
made
uneasy
at
trifles
you
re
not
only
riled
but
i
don
t
blame
you
you
ve
been
on
this
infernal
coast
for
three
there
s
nothing
the
matter
with
the
coast
it
s
only
the
idiots
quite
so
i
seem
somehow
to
feel
that
i
ve
heard
all
that
sort
of
thing
before
i
m
one
of
the
far
be
it
from
me
to
contradict
so
able
a
diagnosis
of
he
caught
the
cushion
which
minton
hurled
at
him
and
laughed
then
he
became
curiously
thoughtful
by
the
way
he
said
wasn
t
it
a
bit
rum
that
koomadhi
didn
t
try
to
prevent
your
swinging
out
to
that
roof
he
s
a
medico
and
so
should
know
how
such
unnatural
exertion
is
apt
to
play
the
mischief
with
a
chap
in
such
a
temperature
as
this
didn
t
he
abuse
you
in
his
polite
way
not
he
said
minton
on
the
contrary
i
believe
i
had
an
idea
that
i
heard
him
suggest
no
no
that
s
a
mistake
of
what
s
a
mistake
that
idea
of
mine
i
don
t
know
how
i
came
to
have
you
were
under
the
impression
somehow
that
he
suggested
your
climbing
to
the
roof
that
was
a
rummy
notion
wasn
t
it
a
bit
too
rummy
for
general
use
oh
no
he
only
said
now
what
the
mischief
did
he
say
oh
no
if
he
said
no
matter
when
he
saw
that
you
were
bent
on
gymnastics
in
the
middle
of
a
day
with
the
temperature
hovering
about
a
hundred
he
should
be
ashamed
of
he
didn
t
say
no
i
ve
just
said
it
let
me
say
it
again
you
should
be
a
at
the
bailey
and
middlesex
session
letts
now
mind
not
a
word
to
the
missus
don
t
let
her
you
evade
her
as
i
m
evading
you
i
ll
see
you
after
dinner
maybe
we
ll
have
a
billiard
together
i
m
too
tired
he
went
off
leaving
letts
trying
to
find
out
the
place
where
he
had
left
off
in
a
novel
of
george
eliot
s
george
eliot
is
still
read
on
the
west
coast
of
africa
but
when
minton
had
left
the
room
letts
did
not
trouble
himself
further
with
the
novel
he
tossed
it
away
and
lay
back
in
his
madeira
chair
with
a
frown
suggesting
perplexity
on
his
face
some
five
minutes
had
passed
and
yet
the
frown
so
far
from
departing
had
but
increased
in
intensity
i
should
like
very
much
to
know
what
his
game
is
he
muttered
it
wouldn
t
at
all
be
a
bad
idea
to
induce
sunstroke
by
on
a
day
like
this
but
why
can
t
he
remember
if
the
nigger
tried
on
that
game
with
him
p
chut
what
s
the
good
of
bothering
about
it
when
the
game
didn
t
come
off
whatever
it
was
but
in
spite
of
his
attempted
dismissal
of
the
whole
matter
from
his
mind
he
utterly
failed
to
give
to
the
confession
of
the
youth
in
middlemarch
it
was
to
the
effect
that
his
father
had
been
a
pawnbroker
and
it
was
very
properly
made
to
the
young
woman
to
the
accompaniment
of
the
peals
of
a
terrific
thunderstorm
the
attention
which
so
striking
an
incident
demanded
viii
if
it
s
a
command
sir
i
ll
obey
if
not
well
oh
nonsense
letts
said
the
commissioner
there
s
no
command
to
a
dinner
with
my
daughter
her
husband
and
another
ah
that
other
man
said
letts
now
i
hope
i
ll
hear
nothing
more
about
your
absurd
objection
to
that
other
man
said
the
commissioner
i
tell
you
that
it
s
not
only
ridiculous
that
prejudice
of
yours
it
s
prejudicial
to
the
service
it
is
upon
my
soul
letts
you
know
as
well
as
i
do
that
the
great
thing
is
to
get
in
touch
with
the
natives
to
show
them
that
as
common
subjects
of
the
sovereign
enjoying
equal
rights
wherever
that
flag
waves
we
are
we
are
well
we
must
show
them
that
we
ve
no
prejudices
you
ll
admit
that
we
must
do
that
as
letts
had
not
written
out
this
particular
speech
for
him
the
commissioner
was
a
trifle
shaky
and
found
it
to
his
advantage
to
abandon
the
oratorical
in
favour
of
the
colloquial
style
i
don
t
feel
called
on
to
show
that
i
m
not
prejudiced
against
the
whole
race
sir
the
whole
race
as
a
race
and
dr
koomadhi
as
an
individual
said
letts
therefore
i
hope
that
you
and
mrs
minton
will
excuse
me
from
your
upon
my
soul
i
m
surprised
at
you
letts
said
commander
hope
i
didn
t
expect
to
find
in
these
days
of
enlightenment
such
prejudices
as
regards
race
great
heavens
sir
is
the
accident
of
a
man
s
being
a
negro
to
be
looked
on
as
debarring
him
from
from
well
from
all
that
you
would
make
out
the
friendship
of
the
superior
race
the
ah
there
you
are
sir
the
superior
race
in
matters
of
equality
there
s
no
oh
of
course
i
don
t
mean
to
suggest
that
there
isn
t
some
difference
between
the
two
races
don
t
they
say
it
was
the
effects
of
the
curse
letts
the
curse
of
ham
if
a
race
was
subject
to
the
disabilities
of
an
early
curse
duly
recorded
you
can
t
quite
expect
them
to
recover
themselves
all
in
a
moment
it
wouldn
t
be
reasonable
it
wouldn
t
be
scriptural
either
but
i
think
that
common
charity
should
make
us
well
should
make
us
do
our
best
to
mitigate
their
unfortunate
position
that
appeal
of
yours
to
scripture
letts
was
used
as
an
argument
in
favour
of
slavery
it
s
unworthy
of
i
agree
with
you
sir
and
i
do
so
the
more
readily
as
i
don
t
recollect
ever
having
made
use
of
such
an
authority
as
scripture
to
bear
out
my
contention
that
the
polish
of
a
nigger
is
no
deeper
than
the
polish
on
a
mahogany
table
a
thin
and
transparent
film
of
lacquer
you
see
i
ve
had
the
advantage
of
living
in
ashantee
for
six
months
and
when
there
i
got
pretty
well
grounded
on
the
negro
as
a
man
and
a
brother
a
man
well
perhaps
a
brother
yes
own
brother
to
the
devil
nonsense
letts
can
t
you
keep
scripture
out
of
the
argument
i
tell
you
sir
i
saw
things
in
the
ashantee
country
that
made
me
feel
certain
that
the
archfiend
made
that
region
his
headquarters
many
years
ago
and
that
he
has
devoted
himself
ever
since
to
the
training
of
the
inhabitants
they
are
his
chosen
people
if
you
had
seen
the
unspeakable
things
that
i
saw
during
my
six
months
in
ashantee
you
would
hold
to
my
belief
that
the
people
have
been
taught
by
satan
himself
and
that
they
have
gone
one
better
than
their
instructor
no
sir
i
ll
not
dine
with
commander
hope
shook
his
head
you
re
very
letts
he
remarked
but
we
won
t
quarrel
i
ll
see
if
i
can
make
gertrude
understand
how
it
is
you
refuse
her
i
hope
to
heaven
that
she
ll
never
get
a
glimpse
of
the
real
negro
sir
the
negro
with
his
lacquer
scratched
the
commissioner
laughed
i
ll
not
tell
her
that
letts
he
said
letts
did
not
laugh
it
was
really
gertrude
who
had
suggested
inviting
dr
koomadhi
to
dinner
at
the
residency
he
had
frequently
partaken
of
the
refreshment
of
tea
in
her
but
she
knew
that
tea
counts
for
nothing
in
the
social
scale
even
at
picotee
it
conferred
no
more
distinction
upon
one
than
a
presentation
at
the
white
house
does
upon
a
citizen
of
the
united
states
or
a
citizen
s
wife
or
sister
he
had
never
been
asked
to
dine
at
the
commissioner
s
table
and
that
she
knew
to
be
a
distinction
and
one
which
he
would
be
certain
to
value
but
when
she
suggested
to
her
father
that
there
would
be
a
certain
gracefulness
in
the
act
of
inviting
dr
koomadhi
to
dinner
she
found
her
suggestion
treated
with
that
form
of
contumely
known
as
the
snub
her
father
had
looked
at
her
sternly
and
walked
away
saying
impossible
what
a
nig
oh
my
dear
you
don
t
understand
these
things
impossible
impossible
gertrude
minton
being
a
woman
may
not
have
understood
some
things
but
she
thoroughly
understood
how
her
father
and
all
other
men
should
be
treated
upon
occasions
she
took
her
snubbing
meekly
as
every
clever
woman
takes
a
snubbing
when
administered
by
a
father
or
a
husband
or
a
brother
and
of
course
later
on
she
carried
her
point
as
any
clever
woman
will
for
a
properly
sustained
scheme
of
meekness
if
persisted
in
will
accomplish
anything
by
making
the
man
who
snubs
thoroughly
ashamed
of
himself
and
the
man
who
is
thoroughly
ashamed
of
himself
will
be
glad
to
come
to
terms
no
matter
how
disadvantageous
to
himself
in
order
to
avert
a
continuance
of
that
reproachful
meekness
it
was
the
commissioner
himself
who
a
few
days
later
went
to
his
daughter
and
told
her
that
if
she
had
her
heart
set
upon
inviting
dr
koomadhi
to
dinner
he
would
not
interfere
it
had
at
first
seemed
to
him
a
monstrous
proposal
he
admitted
but
on
thinking
over
it
calmly
and
with
the
recollection
of
the
circumstances
that
the
present
day
was
one
of
innovations
that
the
negroes
were
treated
on
terms
of
the
most
perfect
equality
by
the
people
of
the
united
states
of
america
he
had
come
to
the
conclusion
that
it
was
necessary
even
for
a
british
naval
officer
to
march
with
the
times
consequently
he
was
prepared
to
do
anything
that
his
daughter
suggested
he
added
however
that
up
to
the
date
at
which
he
was
speaking
he
had
got
on
very
well
without
once
asking
a
nig
that
is
a
negro
gentleman
to
dine
at
his
table
i
knew
you
would
consent
papa
said
gertrude
throwing
off
her
mask
of
meekness
in
a
moment
much
to
the
satisfaction
of
her
father
i
knew
you
would
consent
it
would
be
quite
unlike
you
not
to
consent
you
are
so
so
generous
so
reasonable
in
your
views
on
all
native
questions
i
feel
that
i
that
we
owe
some
amends
that
is
we
should
do
our
best
to
give
him
to
understand
that
we
do
not
regard
a
mere
accident
of
colour
as
disqualifying
him
from
from
quite
so
said
her
father
we
ll
ask
letts
he
won
t
come
why
should
he
not
come
she
asked
letts
is
full
of
prejudice
my
dear
he
has
more
than
once
made
disparaging
remarks
regarding
koomadhi
you
see
he
lived
for
some
months
in
the
ashantee
country
and
saw
the
human
sacrifices
and
other
if
you
speak
to
him
with
due
authority
he
will
be
compelled
to
come
said
gertrude
warmly
you
are
the
head
here
are
you
not
he
looked
at
her
and
assented
though
he
knew
perfectly
well
that
it
was
not
he
who
was
the
head
of
the
residency
would
he
ask
a
nigger
to
dine
at
his
table
if
he
was
at
the
head
of
it
he
asked
himself
well
then
just
tell
letts
that
you
expect
him
to
dine
here
on
wednesday
next
and
he
is
bound
to
come
he
is
only
secretary
my
dear
gertrude
you
know
as
well
as
i
do
what
it
is
to
be
secretary
here
said
the
commissioner
letts
can
do
what
he
pleases
i
shall
certainly
not
coerce
him
in
any
way
i
know
it
would
be
no
use
but
you
must
try
cried
gertrude
she
had
undoubtedly
quite
got
rid
of
her
meekness
you
must
try
and
you
must
succeed
well
the
commissioner
had
tried
and
the
result
of
his
attempt
has
just
been
recorded
he
told
his
daughter
of
the
firm
attitude
that
letts
had
assumed
it
was
just
the
attitude
which
he
himself
would
like
to
assume
if
he
had
the
courage
but
of
course
he
did
not
suggest
so
much
to
gertrude
the
foolish
fellow
i
shall
have
to
go
to
him
myself
said
she
and
she
went
to
him
ix
she
had
at
one
time
fancied
that
letts
was
fond
of
her
and
she
had
thought
that
her
liking
for
him
was
no
mere
fancy
a
young
woman
with
good
looks
and
a
pleasant
manner
and
a
young
man
with
a
career
before
him
are
very
apt
to
have
fancies
in
respect
to
each
other
on
the
west
coast
of
africa
where
good
looks
and
pleasant
manners
are
not
to
be
met
with
daily
of
course
when
gertrude
had
gone
home
for
some
months
and
had
met
major
minton
she
became
aware
of
the
fact
that
her
liking
for
letts
was
the
merest
fancy
and
perhaps
when
she
returned
with
the
story
of
her
having
promised
under
certain
conditions
to
marry
major
minton
letts
had
also
come
to
the
conclusion
that
his
feeling
towards
miss
hope
was
also
a
fancy
this
is
however
not
quite
so
certain
at
any
rate
letts
and
she
had
always
been
very
good
friends
for
she
talked
to
him
quite
pleasantly
at
first
then
quite
earnestly
didactically
and
sarcastically
on
the
subject
of
his
foolish
prejudice
she
called
it
foolish
when
she
was
pleasant
and
she
called
it
contemptible
when
she
ceased
to
be
pleasant
on
a
matter
which
she
for
her
part
thought
had
been
long
ago
passed
out
of
the
region
of
controversy
surely
a
man
of
mr
letts
intelligence
and
observation
could
not
be
serious
in
objecting
to
dine
with
dr
koomadhi
simply
because
he
chanced
to
be
a
negro
but
mr
letts
assured
her
that
he
was
quite
serious
in
the
matter
he
didn
t
pretend
he
said
to
be
superior
in
point
of
intelligence
or
power
of
observation
to
men
who
made
no
objection
to
meet
on
terms
of
perfect
equality
the
whole
ethiopian
race
but
he
had
had
certain
experiences
he
said
and
so
long
as
he
retained
a
recollection
of
these
experiences
he
would
decline
to
sit
at
the
same
table
with
dr
koomadhi
or
any
of
his
race
then
it
was
that
mrs
minton
ceased
to
be
altogether
pleasant
as
to
the
phrases
which
she
employed
in
order
to
induce
mr
letts
to
change
his
mind
you
are
not
the
only
one
with
experiences
she
said
i
have
had
experience
not
merely
of
negroes
generally
but
of
dr
koomadhi
in
particular
and
as
i
told
you
some
time
ago
i
have
reason
to
believe
him
to
be
a
generous
christian
gentleman
that
is
why
i
wish
to
do
all
that
is
in
my
power
to
make
him
understand
that
i
regard
his
possession
of
the
characteristics
of
a
gentleman
and
a
christian
as
more
than
placing
him
on
a
level
with
us
i
feel
that
i
am
inferior
to
dr
koomadhi
in
those
qualities
which
our
religion
teaches
us
to
regard
as
and
i
hope
with
all
my
soul
that
you
will
never
have
a
different
experience
of
him
said
letts
i
know
that
i
shall
have
no
different
experience
of
him
said
she
with
confidence
in
her
pose
and
in
her
tone
he
made
no
reply
to
this
and
then
she
went
on
to
ask
him
some
interesting
questions
regarding
the
general
design
of
the
maker
of
the
universe
and
his
intention
in
respect
of
the
negro
and
though
letts
answered
all
to
the
best
of
his
ability
he
was
not
persuaded
to
accept
mrs
minton
s
invitation
to
dinner
she
was
naturally
very
angry
and
even
went
so
far
as
to
assure
mr
letts
that
his
refusal
to
accept
the
invitation
which
she
offered
him
might
be
prejudicial
to
his
being
offered
any
future
invitations
to
dine
at
her
table
an
assurance
which
he
received
without
emotion
she
told
her
father
of
her
failure
and
though
he
shook
his
head
with
due
seriousness
yet
he
refrained
from
saying
i
told
you
but
when
her
husband
heard
that
letts
would
not
be
persuaded
he
treated
the
incident
with
a
really
remarkable
degree
of
levity
declaring
that
if
he
himself
were
independent
he
would
see
koomadhi
and
all
the
nigger
race
sent
to
a
region
of
congenial
blackness
before
he
would
sit
down
to
dinner
with
the
best
of
them
he
thought
letts
however
something
of
an
ass
for
not
swallowing
his
prejudices
in
a
neighbourhood
where
there
were
so
few
decent
for
himself
he
said
he
would
have
no
objection
to
dine
with
bandits
and
if
they
consented
to
join
in
a
good
pool
afterwards
when
dr
koomadhi
received
his
invitation
to
dine
at
the
residency
it
was
in
the
handwriting
of
mrs
minton
he
smiled
his
smiles
worked
at
low
pressure
in
the
daytime
he
felt
that
he
could
not
be
too
careful
in
this
respect
he
might
if
taken
suddenly
be
led
on
to
smile
naturally
in
the
presence
of
a
man
with
a
kodak
and
where
would
he
be
then
he
smiled
he
went
to
the
drawer
where
he
kept
the
curious
stones
and
looked
at
them
for
some
time
but
without
touching
them
then
he
went
to
the
drawer
in
which
he
kept
the
verses
that
he
had
written
expressive
of
the
effect
of
miss
hope
s
eyes
upon
his
soul
by
a
poetic
licence
he
assumed
that
he
had
a
soul
and
he
liked
to
write
about
it
it
gave
him
an
opportunity
of
making
it
the
last
word
in
a
line
following
one
that
ended
with
the
word
he
read
some
of
the
pages
and
honestly
believed
that
they
were
covered
with
poetry
of
the
highest
character
he
felt
convinced
that
there
was
not
another
man
in
the
whole
ashantee
country
who
could
write
as
good
poetry
and
perhaps
he
was
not
wrong
in
his
estimate
of
his
own
powers
and
the
powers
of
his
ashantee
brethren
as
he
closed
the
door
with
a
bang
his
face
would
have
seemed
to
any
one
who
might
have
chanced
to
see
it
one
mass
of
ivory
this
effect
startling
though
it
was
was
due
merely
to
an
incidental
change
of
expression
he
had
ceased
to
smile
his
teeth
were
tightly
closed
and
his
lips
had
receded
from
them
as
a
tidal
wave
recedes
from
the
strand
of
a
coral
island
disclosing
an
unsuspected
reef
his
lips
hid
in
their
billowy
depths
the
remainder
of
his
face
and
only
that
fearful
double
ridge
of
locked
teeth
would
have
been
visible
to
any
one
had
any
one
been
present
the
words
that
dr
koomadhi
managed
to
utter
without
unlocking
his
teeth
were
undoubtedly
suggestive
of
very
strong
feeling
but
no
literary
interest
attaches
to
their
repetition
he
seated
himself
at
his
desk
after
an
interval
and
wrote
a
letter
which
was
rather
over
than
under
the
demands
made
by
politeness
upon
a
man
who
has
been
asked
to
dinner
in
a
rather
formal
way
he
said
it
would
give
him
the
greatest
pleasure
to
accept
the
most
kind
invitation
with
which
he
had
been
honoured
by
the
commissioner
and
mrs
minton
and
then
he
added
a
word
or
two
which
an
ordinary
gentleman
would
possibly
have
thought
superfluous
regarding
the
pride
which
he
felt
at
being
the
recipient
of
such
a
distinction
it
could
not
be
said
however
that
there
was
anything
in
his
mode
of
conducting
himself
at
the
that
suggested
any
want
of
familiarity
on
his
part
with
the
habits
of
good
society
he
did
not
eat
with
his
knife
though
he
might
have
done
so
without
imperilling
in
any
degree
the
safety
of
his
mouth
nor
did
he
make
any
mistake
regarding
his
or
his
jelly
he
also
drank
his
champagne
out
of
the
right
glass
and
he
did
not
take
it
for
granted
that
the
water
in
his
was
for
any
but
external
use
as
he
lay
back
in
his
chair
with
his
serviette
across
his
knees
and
a
cigarette
between
his
fingers
discussing
with
the
commissioner
with
that
mild
forbearance
which
one
assumes
towards
one
s
host
the
political
situation
of
the
hour
when
mrs
minton
had
left
the
room
he
looked
the
picture
of
a
model
english
gentleman
a
silhouette
picture
he
hoped
that
the
conservatives
would
not
go
to
the
country
without
a
programme
what
were
the
leaders
thinking
of
that
they
hadn
t
familiarised
the
country
with
the
policy
they
meant
to
pursue
should
they
be
returned
to
power
home
rule
for
ireland
was
there
ever
so
ridiculous
a
demand
seriously
made
to
the
country
why
the
irish
were
he
assured
his
host
very
little
better
than
savages
he
should
know
he
had
been
in
ireland
for
close
upon
a
fortnight
he
had
some
amusing
irish
stories
he
imitated
the
brogue
of
the
peasantry
he
didn
t
say
it
was
unmusical
but
home
rule
the
idea
was
too
ridiculous
to
be
entertained
by
any
one
who
knew
the
people
his
political
views
were
sound
beyond
a
doubt
they
were
precisely
the
views
of
the
commissioner
and
his
and
the
green
chartreuse
was
velvety
as
it
should
be
for
this
evening
only
major
minton
sang
to
his
wife
s
accompaniment
a
sentimental
song
which
dwelt
upon
the
misery
of
meeting
daily
with
smiles
a
certain
person
while
his
the
singer
s
heart
was
breaking
he
sang
it
with
feeling
one
would
never
have
thought
that
there
was
a
banjo
in
the
house
then
mrs
minton
sang
a
lovely
scotch
song
about
a
burn
but
it
turned
out
that
the
burn
was
water
and
not
fire
and
the
commissioner
dozed
in
a
corner
at
last
major
minton
suggested
a
game
of
billiards
and
the
suggestion
was
acted
on
without
delay
after
playing
a
game
with
dr
koomadhi
while
her
husband
looked
on
and
criticised
the
strokes
from
the
standpoint
of
a
lenient
if
discriminating
observer
mrs
minton
said
goodnight
she
was
tired
she
said
and
she
knew
that
her
husband
and
dr
koomadhi
meant
to
play
all
night
so
she
thought
she
might
as
well
go
soon
as
late
of
course
dr
koomadhi
entreated
her
not
to
leave
them
they
would
he
assured
her
do
anything
to
retain
her
they
would
even
play
a
four
game
abhorred
of
if
she
would
stay
her
husband
did
not
join
in
the
entreaties
of
their
guest
he
played
tricky
cannons
until
she
had
left
the
room
shall
i
break
minton
asked
i
ll
play
with
spot
for
a
before
he
had
completed
his
second
break
of
the
commissioner
had
fallen
asleep
with
his
cigar
between
his
fingers
when
they
had
commenced
he
had
been
critical
but
he
broke
down
under
the
monotony
of
the
second
moderate
break
for
about
a
quarter
of
an
hour
the
game
went
on
and
all
the
variations
from
hard
lines
to
dammitall
were
indulged
in
by
the
players
minton
had
scored
eighty
against
koomadhi
s
and
was
about
to
play
a
hazard
requiring
great
judgment
when
his
opponent
came
behind
him
saying
i
don
t
see
how
it
can
be
done
a
cannon
is
the
easier
well
i
ll
try
the
hazard
anyway
and
try
to
leave
the
red
over
the
you
ll
need
to
do
it
very
gently
said
his
opponent
almost
leaning
over
him
as
he
took
his
aim
at
the
red
ball
for
quite
half
a
minute
minton
hung
over
his
cue
and
in
that
space
of
time
koomadhi
had
taken
out
of
his
pocket
the
curious
stone
shaped
like
a
broad
ear
and
had
put
it
to
his
own
mouth
for
a
second
or
two
while
he
stood
behind
the
player
returning
it
quickly
to
his
pocket
before
the
cue
had
struck
the
ball
what
a
stroke
cried
minton
it
would
disgrace
our
friend
i
said
the
cannon
was
the
easier
game
remarked
koomadhi
chalking
his
cue
hallo
what
are
you
going
to
do
who
the
mischief
could
play
billiards
a
night
like
this
in
such
a
suit
of
armour
as
this
laughed
minton
he
was
in
the
act
of
pulling
his
shirt
over
his
head
and
he
spoke
from
within
its
folds
in
another
second
he
was
stripped
to
the
waist
now
my
friend
he
chuckled
we
ll
see
who
ll
win
this
game
this
is
the
proper
rig
for
any
one
who
means
to
play
billiards
as
billiards
should
be
i
wouldn
t
have
done
that
if
i
were
you
said
koomadhi
come
you
had
much
better
put
on
your
shirt
the
commissioner
may
let
him
object
laughed
the
man
he
s
an
old
fogey
anyway
like
most
naval
men
he
has
no
heart
in
anything
beyond
the
shape
of
a
button
and
the
exact
spot
where
it
should
be
worn
how
was
it
we
had
no
nuts
for
dinner
i
should
like
to
know
koomadhi
had
made
a
cannon
he
walked
round
the
table
to
get
the
chalk
and
in
a
second
major
minton
had
picked
up
the
red
ball
and
slipped
it
into
his
pocket
when
koomadhi
turned
to
play
the
screw
back
which
he
meant
to
do
carefully
only
the
white
balls
were
on
the
table
and
minton
denied
all
knowledge
of
the
whereabouts
of
the
red
koomadhi
laughed
and
put
his
cue
into
the
stand
oh
i
say
a
joke
s
a
joke
chuckled
minton
producing
the
ball
from
his
pocket
you
won
t
play
any
more
oh
yes
we
ll
have
another
game
only
for
a
change
we
ll
play
it
with
our
feet
now
why
the
mischief
people
don
t
play
it
with
their
feet
i
can
t
understand
it
stands
to
reason
that
the
stroke
must
be
far
surer
i
ll
show
you
what
i
mean
oh
confound
those
things
i
ll
have
them
off
in
a
you
ll
do
nothing
of
the
kind
said
the
doctor
firmly
as
major
minton
kicked
off
his
shoes
and
hastened
to
get
rid
of
the
only
garments
that
he
was
wearing
for
god
s
sake
don
t
make
such
a
fool
of
yourself
he
had
caught
his
hands
preventing
his
carrying
out
his
singular
design
of
illustrating
the
prehensile
character
of
the
muscles
of
the
human
foot
now
then
put
on
your
shirt
and
finish
your
i
must
be
major
minton
grinned
and
turning
suddenly
caught
dr
koomadhi
by
the
tail
of
his
he
had
just
put
it
on
and
with
a
quick
jerk
upset
him
on
the
floor
god
bless
my
soul
cried
the
commissioner
waking
up
dr
koomadhi
was
brushing
the
dust
off
his
waistcoat
major
minton
was
swinging
halfway
up
one
of
the
ropes
that
controlled
the
ventilator
of
the
roof
what
in
the
name
of
all
that
s
ridiculous
is
this
said
the
commissioner
by
the
lord
i
seem
to
be
still
dreaming
a
nightmare
by
george
sir
i
really
must
ask
your
pardon
sir
said
koomadhi
i
had
no
idea
that
the
thing
would
go
on
so
far
as
it
has
major
minton
and
i
were
having
a
rather
funny
trial
of
strength
he
was
on
one
rope
i
was
on
the
other
i
let
go
my
hold
come
down
man
come
down
the
game
is
and
a
most
peculiar
game
it
seems
to
have
been
said
the
commissioner
great
heavens
it
can
t
be
possible
that
he
took
off
his
shirt
it
was
very
foolish
sir
said
koomadhi
i
think
i
ll
say
the
commissioner
paid
no
attention
to
him
all
his
attention
was
given
to
his
who
was
swinging
negligently
with
one
hand
on
the
ventilator
rope
when
he
at
last
dropped
to
the
floor
minton
rubbed
his
eyes
and
looked
around
him
in
a
dazed
way
my
god
he
muttered
how
do
i
come
to
be
like
this
this
where
s
my
shirt
you
should
be
ashamed
of
yourself
sir
said
the
commissioner
sternly
what
have
you
been
drinking
in
your
nothing
said
minton
putting
on
his
shirt
i
drank
nothing
but
what
possessed
me
to
make
such
an
ass
of
myself
i
can
t
tell
i
beg
your
pardon
koomadhi
i
assure
you
i
didn
t
mean
to
why
it
all
appears
like
a
dream
to
oh
a
dream
good
night
dr
koomadhi
said
the
commissioner
i
m
sorry
that
anything
should
happen
don
t
say
another
word
sir
i
entreat
of
you
cried
koomadhi
i
fear
that
i
was
after
all
the
most
to
blame
i
should
have
known
where
this
sort
of
was
likely
to
land
us
good
night
sir
i
really
feel
that
an
apology
should
come
from
me
good
night
minton
no
no
don
t
say
a
word
i
feel
that
i
have
disgraced
myself
for
minton
now
clothed
and
in
his
right
mind
saw
him
off
and
then
returned
to
the
presence
of
his
he
knew
that
the
commissioner
was
desirous
of
having
a
word
or
two
with
him
and
he
was
not
the
man
to
run
away
from
such
an
interview
in
fact
he
himself
was
anxious
to
have
the
first
word
and
he
had
it
look
here
sir
he
said
i
want
to
say
that
i
know
i
made
an
infernal
fool
of
myself
why
i
did
it
i
can
t
tell
i
touched
nothing
but
all
then
there
is
the
less
excuse
for
your
behaviour
said
the
commissioner
drily
i
don
t
want
to
say
anything
more
about
this
unhappy
business
only
i
will
point
out
to
you
that
koomadhi
could
easily
make
things
very
disagreeable
for
us
if
he
were
so
minded
you
threw
him
on
the
floor
heavens
above
i
suppose
i
did
throw
him
but
why
why
why
that
s
what
i
want
to
perhaps
an
explanation
may
come
to
you
in
the
course
of
a
day
or
two
you
had
better
go
to
bed
yes
i
ll
go
to
bed
only
of
course
there
s
no
reason
why
you
should
let
the
matter
go
i
certainly
for
my
own
sake
and
yours
will
keep
it
as
secret
as
possible
i
only
hope
that
koomadhi
oh
koomadhi
is
all
right
but
i
don
t
see
that
gertrude
or
letts
should
hear
anything
of
they
don
t
hear
anything
of
it
from
me
i
promise
you
will
you
ring
for
the
lamps
to
be
turned
out
dick
minton
pulled
the
bell
his
went
to
his
bed
without
a
word
but
an
hour
had
passed
before
dick
went
to
his
room
he
lit
a
cigar
and
strolled
away
from
the
residency
to
the
brink
of
the
sea
and
there
on
the
low
scrub
looking
out
to
the
enormous
rollers
that
broke
on
the
shallow
beach
two
miles
from
where
he
stood
spreading
their
white
foam
all
around
he
tried
to
think
how
it
was
he
had
been
led
to
behave
more
foolishly
than
he
had
ever
behaved
since
the
days
of
his
youth
he
was
not
successful
in
his
attempts
in
this
direction
and
dr
koomadhi
also
remained
thinking
his
thoughts
for
fully
half
an
hour
after
reaching
that
pleasant
verandah
of
his
which
got
every
breath
that
came
inland
from
the
sea
i
can
do
it
easily
enough
yes
in
his
presence
but
what
good
is
that
to
me
he
muttered
no
good
whatever
just
the
opposite
i
must
have
the
khabela
ah
the
khabela
that
works
miles
two
days
later
he
paid
his
visit
to
the
residency
and
drank
tea
with
mrs
minton
he
told
her
that
he
found
it
necessary
to
go
up
country
for
ten
days
or
so
he
knew
of
a
nice
miasma
tract
and
he
hoped
to
gain
in
a
few
days
as
much
information
regarding
its
operations
on
the
human
frame
as
he
could
obtain
in
as
many
years
in
the
comparative
salubriousness
of
the
coast
her
husband
did
not
put
in
an
appearance
while
koomadhi
was
in
the
his
wife
reproached
him
for
that
he
took
her
reproach
meekly
xi
moonlight
was
flooding
the
forest
beyond
the
native
village
of
moumbossa
on
the
upper
gambia
but
where
dr
koomadhi
was
walking
no
moonbeam
penetrated
the
branches
formed
an
arch
above
him
as
dense
with
interwoven
boughs
and
thick
leaves
as
though
the
arch
was
a
railway
tunnel
only
in
the
far
distance
a
gleam
of
light
could
be
seen
at
times
the
deep
silence
of
the
night
was
broken
by
the
many
sounds
of
the
tropical
jungle
every
sound
was
familiar
to
dr
koomadhi
and
he
laughed
joyously
as
one
laughs
on
recognising
the
voice
of
a
friend
the
wild
shriek
of
a
monkey
pounced
upon
by
some
other
creature
the
horrible
laugh
of
a
hyena
the
yell
of
a
lory
and
then
a
deep
silence
he
felt
at
home
in
the
midst
of
that
forest
though
when
he
spoke
of
home
within
the
hearing
of
civilised
people
he
meant
it
to
be
understood
that
he
referred
to
england
when
he
emerged
from
the
brake
he
found
himself
gazing
at
a
solitary
beehive
hut
in
the
centre
of
a
great
cleared
space
a
quarter
of
a
mile
away
the
moonlight
showed
him
the
village
of
moumbossa
with
its
lines
of
palms
and
plantains
he
walked
up
to
the
hut
without
removing
his
rifle
from
his
shoulder
and
stood
for
some
moments
at
the
entrance
then
he
heard
a
voice
saying
to
him
in
the
tongue
of
the
ashantees
enter
my
son
and
let
thy
mother
see
if
thy
face
is
i
can
not
enter
mother
he
replied
in
the
same
language
but
i
have
come
far
and
in
peril
to
talk
with
you
we
must
talk
together
in
the
he
retained
among
his
other
memories
a
vivid
recollection
of
the
interior
of
a
native
hut
he
could
not
bring
himself
to
face
the
ordeal
of
entering
the
one
before
him
i
will
soon
be
beside
you
came
the
voice
and
in
a
few
moments
there
crawled
out
from
the
a
old
negress
of
great
stature
and
with
only
the
smallest
perceptible
stoop
she
walked
round
dr
koomadhi
and
then
looked
into
his
face
with
a
laugh
yes
she
said
it
is
indeed
you
my
son
and
i
see
that
you
need
my
you
are
right
mother
said
he
i
wondered
if
you
still
retained
your
old
powers
that
is
why
i
stood
for
some
minutes
outside
the
hut
i
said
if
my
mother
has
still
her
messengers
in
the
air
and
in
the
earth
they
will
tell
her
that
her
son
has
come
to
her
once
more
you
should
not
have
doubted
she
said
do
you
fancy
that
such
powers
as
have
come
to
me
by
the
possession
of
the
sacred
khabela
can
decay
by
reason
of
age
or
the
weight
of
days
if
that
had
been
my
belief
should
i
have
come
to
you
this
night
he
asked
i
have
need
of
all
your
powers
i
have
need
of
all
the
powers
of
the
you
shall
have
all
that
i
can
command
are
you
not
my
son
said
the
old
woman
but
have
you
found
the
sacred
ear
to
fail
you
never
mother
said
dr
koomadhi
you
told
me
what
it
could
do
and
it
has
never
failed
me
within
its
limits
but
i
must
have
the
more
powerful
charm
of
the
sacred
mouth
my
need
is
it
must
be
extreme
and
i
will
not
deny
it
to
you
said
his
mother
you
know
what
it
can
do
no
man
or
woman
can
withstand
it
if
any
offspring
of
woman
should
hold
that
sacred
mouth
to
his
ear
or
her
ear
as
the
case
may
be
the
words
which
you
whisper
into
the
sacred
ear
will
seem
the
truth
whatever
those
words
may
be
you
know
that
but
the
magic
of
the
khabela
is
far
greater
it
will
work
at
a
distance
but
if
it
is
lost
you
know
what
the
consequences
will
be
you
know
the
decree
of
the
great
fanshatee
the
i
know
it
the
stone
khabela
shall
not
be
lost
i
accept
the
responsibility
i
must
have
command
over
it
until
the
return
of
the
and
thou
shalt
have
control
of
it
whether
for
good
or
evil
it
told
me
that
thou
wert
nigh
so
that
thou
must
have
the
ear
charm
in
thy
possession
even
it
is
here
mother
in
this
pocket
i
have
shown
it
to
no
mortal
whose
colour
is
not
as
our
colour
whose
hair
is
not
as
our
the
white
men
laugh
at
all
magic
such
as
ours
i
have
yes
they
laugh
at
it
but
some
of
them
practise
a
form
of
it
themselves
i
have
seen
one
practise
it
in
a
great
room
in
england
without
the
aid
of
a
mystic
stone
he
told
sober
men
that
they
were
drunk
and
they
acted
as
drunk
men
he
told
rough
fellows
that
they
were
priests
and
they
preached
sermons
as
long
and
as
stupid
as
any
that
we
have
heard
missionaries
and
yet
they
say
that
our
magic
is
a
thing
yes
that
is
the
way
with
the
white
men
when
they
have
said
their
word
damn
on
any
matter
they
believe
that
the
last
word
has
been
said
upon
it
and
all
that
other
men
may
say
they
laugh
they
are
fools
my
son
and
thou
art
a
fool
to
dwell
among
they
are
wise
men
up
to
a
certain
point
they
are
only
fools
on
the
subject
of
names
they
say
that
magic
is
accursed
but
they
say
that
hypnotism
is
science
and
science
is
the
only
thing
in
which
they
he
had
some
trouble
translating
the
word
hypnotism
into
the
native
speech
enough
about
them
let
me
have
the
mystery
and
then
let
me
have
a
cake
that
has
been
baked
in
the
earth
with
the
leaves
of
the
thou
shalt
have
both
ray
son
before
the
morning
light
enter
my
hut
and
i
will
dream
that
thou
art
a
child
but
that
was
just
where
dr
koomadhi
drew
the
line
he
would
not
crawl
into
the
hut
even
to
make
his
venerable
mother
fancy
that
his
youth
was
renewed
like
the
eagles
he
returned
to
picotee
the
next
day
and
as
he
walked
through
the
forest
each
side
of
the
bush
track
was
lined
with
monkeys
they
came
from
far
and
near
and
put
their
faces
down
to
the
ground
their
at
the
back
of
their
heads
he
talked
to
them
in
simian
yes
he
said
ye
know
that
i
am
the
holder
of
the
khabela
intrusted
to
me
by
my
brother
fanshatee
but
if
i
lose
it
your
attitude
will
not
be
the
xii
two
days
had
passed
after
his
return
to
picotee
before
dr
koomadhi
found
time
to
call
at
the
residency
he
found
major
minton
lying
on
the
cane
settee
in
a
condition
of
perspiration
and
exhaustion
i
m
sure
dr
koomadhi
will
bear
me
out
in
what
i
say
said
mrs
minton
as
the
doctor
entered
the
room
i
ve
been
lecturing
my
husband
upon
the
danger
of
taking
such
violent
exercise
as
he
has
been
indulging
in
she
continued
just
look
at
the
state
that
he
is
in
doctor
the
idea
of
any
sane
man
on
a
day
like
this
entering
into
a
climbing
contest
with
a
monkey
great
heavens
is
that
what
he
has
been
about
and
the
thermometer
nearer
a
hundred
than
ninety
cried
the
doctor
i
admit
that
i
was
an
ass
muttered
the
major
but
somehow
i
felt
that
i
should
show
jacco
that
i
could
lick
him
on
his
own
ground
not
exactly
his
ground
we
were
never
on
the
and
when
i
went
out
i
found
them
swinging
on
the
topmost
bough
of
one
of
the
trees
said
mrs
minton
upon
my
word
my
father
will
feel
scandalised
such
a
thing
never
occurred
at
the
residency
apart
from
the
social
aspect
of
the
incident
i
am
bound
to
say
that
it
was
most
indiscreet
said
dr
koomadhi
nothing
precipitates
sunstroke
like
in
a
high
temperature
major
this
must
not
occur
all
right
don
t
make
a
fuss
or
you
ll
soon
be
as
hot
as
i
am
said
the
major
rising
with
difficulty
and
crossing
the
room
he
was
bent
almost
double
to
his
wife
s
hallo
said
the
doctor
what
have
you
been
doing
to
yourself
it
is
not
what
i
have
been
doing
but
what
i
ve
left
undone
that
you
notice
laughed
the
major
the
fact
is
that
i
couldn
t
be
bothered
shaving
for
the
last
few
mornings
that
s
what
you
that
was
precisely
what
the
doctor
did
notice
he
noticed
the
tossed
hair
of
the
major
s
head
and
such
bristles
of
a
beard
and
whiskers
as
had
completely
altered
the
appearance
of
his
face
he
also
noticed
that
when
mrs
minton
turned
away
for
a
moment
her
husband
deftly
abstracted
two
lumps
of
sugar
from
the
bowl
and
began
eating
them
surreptitiously
no
nuts
he
heard
him
mutter
contemptuously
some
time
afterwards
nuts
said
mrs
minton
you
ll
ruin
your
digestion
if
you
eat
any
more
nuts
dick
dr
koomadhi
will
you
join
your
voice
with
mine
in
protest
against
this
foolish
boy
s
fancy
for
nuts
you
speak
with
the
recognised
authority
of
a
medical
man
i
can
only
speak
as
a
wife
and
i
am
not
so
foolish
as
to
fancy
that
that
constitutes
any
claim
to
attention
if
you
continue
rubbing
your
chest
in
that
absurd
way
dick
you
ll
certainly
make
a
dr
koomadhi
did
not
fail
to
observe
that
the
major
was
rubbing
his
chest
with
his
fingers
i
m
quite
surprised
at
your
imprudence
said
he
shaking
his
head
you
told
me
some
time
ago
that
though
you
had
been
for
seven
years
in
india
you
never
had
a
touch
of
fever
and
you
attributed
this
to
the
attention
you
paid
to
your
diet
now
you
know
as
well
as
i
do
that
if
a
man
requires
to
be
careful
in
india
there
is
double
reason
for
him
to
be
careful
on
the
west
coast
of
africa
how
can
you
so
disregard
the
most
elementary
laws
of
health
major
minton
laughed
there
s
nothing
like
exercise
he
said
and
the
best
of
all
exercise
is
climbing
why
my
dear
koomadhi
haven
t
the
greatest
intellects
of
the
age
taken
to
climbing
wasn
t
tyndall
a
splendid
mountaineer
i
don
t
profess
to
be
superior
to
tyndall
now
as
i
can
t
get
mountains
to
climb
in
this
neighbourhood
i
take
naturally
to
the
trees
i
think
sometimes
i
could
pass
the
rest
of
my
life
pleasantly
enough
here
man
wants
but
little
here
below
give
me
a
branch
to
swing
on
a
green
and
a
friend
who
won
t
resent
a
practical
joke
i
want
nothing
more
by
the
way
it
s
odd
that
i
never
saw
until
lately
in
fact
until
two
days
ago
what
good
fun
there
is
in
a
practical
his
perception
of
what
he
calls
good
fun
deprived
me
of
my
brushes
and
comb
this
morning
said
mrs
minton
i
must
confess
i
fail
to
see
the
humour
in
hiding
one
s
brushes
and
it
was
the
most
innocent
lark
in
the
world
and
you
had
no
reason
to
be
so
put
out
about
it
said
her
husband
leaning
over
the
back
of
her
chair
dr
koomadhi
saw
that
he
was
tying
the
sash
of
her
loose
gown
to
the
wickerwork
of
the
table
at
which
she
was
sitting
so
that
she
could
not
rise
without
overturning
the
tray
with
the
cups
my
dear
major
said
the
doctor
a
jest
is
a
jest
but
your
wife
s
china
oh
you
have
given
me
away
but
i
ll
be
equal
to
you
never
fear
said
the
major
shambling
off
as
his
wife
prepared
to
loose
the
knot
of
her
sash
from
the
table
she
did
not
speak
a
word
but
her
face
was
flushed
and
it
was
plain
that
she
was
greatly
annoyed
the
flush
upon
her
face
deepened
when
her
husband
went
out
to
the
verandah
and
uttered
a
curious
guttural
cry
how
has
he
learned
that
asked
dr
koomadhi
learned
what
asked
mrs
minton
that
oh
it
s
some
of
his
i
daresay
but
ah
i
thought
i
could
bring
you
here
my
friend
cried
the
major
as
jacco
the
baboon
swung
off
his
usual
place
over
the
porch
into
his
arms
dr
koomadhi
watched
the
creature
run
its
fingers
through
the
major
s
disordered
hair
he
heard
the
guttural
sound
made
by
the
baboon
and
he
heard
it
responded
to
by
the
major
he
found
that
major
minton
was
on
a
level
with
himself
in
his
acquaintance
with
the
simian
language
he
rose
and
took
leave
of
mrs
minton
and
then
with
a
word
of
warning
in
regard
to
his
imprudent
exercises
of
the
major
left
the
residency
it
was
not
until
he
had
reached
his
own
house
that
he
discovered
that
upon
the
back
of
his
spotless
linen
coat
there
had
been
executed
in
ink
the
grinning
face
of
a
clown
he
recollected
that
he
had
seen
major
minton
toying
with
a
quill
pen
behind
him
as
he
sat
drinking
tea
xiii
a
few
days
later
dr
koomadhi
was
visited
unofficially
by
commander
hope
the
poor
commissioner
was
as
grave
as
if
an
impetuous
french
naval
officer
had
just
been
reported
to
have
insulted
the
british
flag
on
some
part
of
the
coast
protected
nominally
by
that
variegated
bunting
he
was
anxious
to
consult
the
doctor
regarding
the
condition
of
major
minton
indeed
said
the
doctor
what
do
you
suppose
is
the
matter
with
him
sir
the
commissioner
tapped
his
forehead
significantly
a
slight
touch
of
sunstroke
i
fancy
he
replied
he
has
been
behaving
strangely
giving
us
a
great
deal
of
uneasiness
koomadhi
oh
yes
it
s
clearly
a
touch
of
that
s
bad
but
not
sufficiently
bad
to
be
very
grave
about
sir
said
the
doctor
you
know
how
these
attacks
pass
away
leaving
scarcely
a
trace
behind
if
properly
treated
you
have
of
course
applied
the
ice
we
ve
applied
nothing
said
the
commissioner
he
s
beyond
our
control
koomadhi
he
left
the
residency
last
evening
and
has
not
turned
up
great
heavens
it
s
a
fact
oh
he
must
be
stark
staring
mad
the
commissioner
was
walking
up
and
down
the
doctor
s
room
in
a
state
of
most
unofficial
perturbation
i
found
it
necessary
to
speak
to
him
pretty
plainly
a
couple
of
days
ago
it
was
bad
enough
for
him
to
climb
up
the
mast
and
nail
the
flag
to
the
pole
so
that
it
could
not
be
hauled
down
at
sunset
but
when
it
conies
to
dropping
the
keys
of
the
into
the
the
thing
ceases
to
be
a
joke
i
gave
him
a
good
slating
and
he
sulked
he
had
an
idea
his
wife
told
me
that
he
understood
the
simian
language
and
he
was
for
ever
practising
his
knowledge
upon
our
tame
baboon
what
on
earth
does
that
mean
if
not
sunstroke
tell
me
that
koomadhi
it
looks
very
like
sunstroke
indeed
said
the
doctor
but
where
can
he
have
disappeared
to
that
s
the
question
that
makes
me
feel
uneasy
said
the
commissioner
i
don
t
like
to
make
a
fuss
just
yet
but
i
ll
tell
you
what
it
is
koomadhi
he
lowered
his
voice
to
a
whisper
the
man
has
a
delusion
that
he
is
an
ape
it
s
impossible
to
keep
it
a
secret
any
longer
god
help
us
all
god
help
my
poor
girl
my
poor
girl
the
commissioner
broke
down
completely
and
wept
with
his
face
bowed
down
to
his
hands
he
was
very
unofficial
tears
are
not
official
come
sir
you
must
not
give
way
like
this
said
the
doctor
this
coast
is
the
very
devil
for
men
like
minton
who
will
not
take
reasonable
precautions
but
there
s
no
reason
to
be
alarmed
just
yet
the
will
be
here
in
a
few
days
and
the
instant
the
steamer
drops
her
anchor
we
ll
ship
him
aboard
he
ll
be
all
right
take
my
word
for
it
when
he
sails
a
few
degrees
but
where
is
he
now
he
s
probably
loafing
around
the
outskirts
of
the
jungle
but
he
ll
be
safe
enough
and
he
ll
return
most
likely
within
the
next
few
you
are
of
that
opinion
assuredly
above
all
things
there
must
be
no
talk
about
this
business
it
might
ruin
him
socially
and
your
daughter
poor
girl
poor
girl
i
agree
with
you
koomadhi
it
must
be
kept
a
secret
no
human
being
must
know
about
this
shocking
if
he
does
not
return
before
send
a
message
to
me
i
ll
not
fail
poor
girl
oh
koomadhi
her
heart
will
be
broken
her
heart
will
be
broken
the
commissioner
went
away
looking
at
least
ten
years
older
than
when
he
had
last
been
seen
by
dr
koomadhi
the
doctor
watched
him
stumbling
down
the
pathway
then
he
laughed
and
opened
a
bottle
of
champagne
which
he
drank
at
a
gulp
it
was
only
when
he
was
alone
that
he
allowed
himself
the
luxury
of
drinking
champagne
in
gulps
shortly
before
midnight
he
paid
a
visit
to
the
barracks
of
the
houssas
and
found
that
the
officer
who
was
on
the
sick
list
was
very
much
better
returning
by
the
side
of
the
jungle
he
heard
the
sound
of
steps
and
a
laugh
behind
him
it
might
have
been
the
laugh
of
a
man
but
the
steps
were
not
those
of
a
man
he
looked
round
a
shambling
creature
was
following
him
a
creature
with
a
hairy
face
and
matted
locks
a
creature
whose
eyes
gleamed
wildly
in
the
moonlight
how
the
mischief
can
you
walk
so
fast
along
a
path
like
this
came
the
voice
of
major
minton
from
the
hairy
jaws
of
the
thing
i
m
not
walking
so
fast
after
all
said
the
doctor
he
had
not
given
the
least
start
on
coming
face
to
face
with
the
thing
i
don
t
care
much
about
walking
on
roads
but
i
ll
back
myself
to
cross
a
forest
without
leaving
the
trees
said
the
thing
that
would
beat
you
koomadhi
oh
by
the
way
here
he
emitted
some
guttural
sounds
the
simian
language
was
recognised
by
the
doctor
and
replied
to
with
a
smile
and
for
some
time
the
two
exchanged
remarks
the
doctor
was
the
first
to
break
down
i
don
t
understand
that
expression
said
he
when
the
other
had
repeated
some
sounds
why
you
fool
that
means
is
there
anything
to
drink
handy
said
the
voice
of
major
minton
why
i
know
more
of
the
language
than
you
we
ve
been
talking
nothing
else
for
the
past
day
or
where
have
you
been
in
the
jungle
where
else
would
you
have
me
be
where
indeed
you
d
better
stay
with
me
i
ll
give
you
something
to
that
will
suit
me
nicely
i
m
a
bit
thirsty
and
here
he
lapsed
into
the
simian
jabber
he
curled
himself
up
in
a
corner
of
the
sofa
and
took
the
tumbler
that
dr
koomadhi
offered
to
him
drinking
off
the
contents
pretty
much
after
the
style
of
the
doctor
when
alone
he
then
began
talking
about
the
sense
of
freedom
incidental
to
a
life
spent
in
the
jungle
and
every
now
and
again
his
words
became
what
was
long
ago
known
as
gibberish
but
nearly
every
utterance
was
intelligible
to
the
doctor
after
some
time
had
passed
the
doctor
took
the
carved
stones
out
of
the
desk
drawer
and
handing
one
to
his
companion
said
by
the
way
i
wonder
if
you
are
still
deaf
to
the
sound
of
this
thing
try
it
what
s
the
good
i
m
not
such
a
fool
as
to
fancy
that
any
sound
can
come
from
a
doesn
t
shakespeare
say
something
about
sermons
in
stones
oh
shakespeare
he
could
hear
things
and
see
things
that
no
one
else
could
well
give
me
the
he
put
the
roughly
carved
lips
to
his
ear
while
the
doctor
raised
the
other
to
his
own
mouth
you
can
hear
no
murmur
said
the
doctor
nothing
whatever
i
think
if
you
don
t
mind
i
ll
go
i
can
give
you
a
a
bed
what
rot
no
thank
you
i
ll
be
comfortable
enough
he
curled
himself
up
and
went
asleep
before
the
doctor
s
eyes
when
the
doctor
entered
his
the
next
morning
the
apartment
was
empty
xiv
i
was
a
fool
for
not
detaining
him
by
force
said
dr
koomadhi
in
telling
the
commissioner
a
few
hours
later
that
his
had
paid
a
visit
to
his
the
doctor
s
house
but
there
really
is
nothing
to
be
alarmed
about
he
has
a
whim
but
he
ll
soon
tire
of
i
hope
to
heavens
he
ll
return
by
evening
said
the
commander
the
will
be
here
in
the
morning
and
we
must
get
him
aboard
by
some
means
what
a
pity
you
didn
t
lock
him
to
tell
you
the
truth
i
was
afraid
to
do
so
if
he
had
made
a
row
in
the
morning
on
feeling
himself
a
prisoner
the
thing
would
be
over
the
town
before
noon
oh
you
may
be
certain
that
he
ll
turn
up
again
either
or
that
night
one
of
the
officers
of
the
houssas
gave
dr
koomadhi
a
circumstantial
account
of
a
strange
chimpanzee
which
one
of
the
men
had
seen
on
the
outskirts
of
the
jungle
at
daybreak
if
the
thing
wasn
t
a
chimpanzee
it
certainly
was
a
gorilla
the
officer
said
and
he
meant
to
have
a
shot
at
it
would
the
doctor
join
him
in
the
hunt
he
inquired
the
doctor
said
he
would
be
delighted
to
do
so
but
not
before
the
next
evening
he
had
so
much
on
hand
the
gun
was
heard
early
in
the
morning
and
dr
koomadhi
had
the
privilege
of
reading
his
saturday
review
at
breakfast
he
went
to
the
residency
before
noon
the
commissioner
was
not
there
he
had
gone
aboard
the
mr
letts
the
secretary
said
without
looking
up
from
his
paper
i
wonder
if
you
know
anything
about
minton
mr
letts
whispered
koomadhi
i
wonder
if
you
know
anything
about
him
dr
koomadhi
said
mr
letts
he
has
not
been
near
me
since
the
night
before
last
said
the
doctor
has
he
been
here
before
the
secretary
could
reply
a
servant
knocked
at
the
office
door
conveying
mrs
minton
s
compliments
to
dr
koomadhi
and
to
inquire
if
he
would
be
good
enough
to
step
into
the
until
the
commissioner
returned
from
the
mail
steamer
dr
koomadhi
said
he
would
be
pleased
to
do
so
and
he
left
the
office
and
followed
the
servant
into
the
an
apartment
which
occupied
one
end
of
the
residency
and
had
windows
opening
upon
the
verandah
and
affording
a
view
of
that
portion
of
the
jungle
which
was
nearest
picotee
he
scarcely
recognised
gertrude
minton
the
deadly
pale
worn
woman
who
greeted
him
silently
had
nothing
in
common
with
the
brilliant
daughter
of
the
commissioner
who
a
few
months
before
had
been
as
exquisite
as
a
lily
in
the
midst
of
a
jungle
what
are
we
to
do
what
are
we
to
do
she
whispered
you
have
seen
him
since
we
saw
him
what
did
he
say
will
he
return
in
time
to
be
put
aboard
the
steamer
oh
for
god
s
sake
give
me
a
word
of
hope
one
word
to
keep
me
from
going
mad
too
mrs
minton
said
dr
koomadhi
you
have
asked
me
a
great
many
questions
may
i
remind
you
that
i
never
asked
but
one
question
of
you
one
question
what
do
you
mean
i
asked
you
if
you
thought
you
could
marry
me
what
was
your
answer
why
do
you
come
here
to
remind
me
of
that
if
you
are
thinking
of
that
fault
of
mine
it
was
cruel
i
know
but
i
did
not
mean
it
if
you
are
thinking
of
that
rather
than
of
the
best
way
to
help
us
you
had
much
better
have
stayed
you
said
you
would
as
soon
marry
a
baboon
as
marry
i
checked
when
you
had
practically
said
well
what
then
nothing
you
did
not
marry
me
and
the
alternative
was
your
own
the
alternative
yes
you
married
a
baboon
you
know
it
is
there
any
doubt
on
your
mind
come
to
this
he
had
suddenly
crossed
the
room
to
a
window
facing
the
jungle
she
staggered
to
his
side
he
threw
open
the
shutter
and
pointed
out
what
mrs
minton
saw
was
a
huge
ape
running
on
all
fours
across
the
cleared
space
just
outside
the
jungle
the
creature
ran
on
for
some
distance
then
stopped
and
turned
round
gibbering
then
from
the
jungle
there
came
another
ape
only
in
a
more
upright
posture
with
a
yell
he
caught
the
hand
of
the
first
and
the
creature
stood
upright
then
hand
in
hand
in
a
horribly
grotesque
dance
they
advanced
together
until
they
were
within
a
hundred
yards
of
the
residency
you
see
you
see
laughed
dr
koomadhi
you
may
still
be
able
to
recognise
some
of
his
features
in
spite
of
the
transformation
you
have
had
your
choice
a
baboon
is
your
husband
and
your
child
the
shriek
that
the
woman
gave
before
falling
to
the
floor
frightened
even
dr
koomadhi
in
a
second
the
room
door
was
opened
mr
letts
appeared
he
rushed
at
dr
koomadhi
and
had
his
hands
on
his
throat
before
the
doctor
could
raise
mrs
minton
he
forced
the
negro
backward
into
the
porch
and
flung
him
out
almost
upon
the
commissioner
and
mr
ross
the
surgeon
of
the
who
were
in
the
act
of
entering
for
heaven
s
sake
letts
cried
the
commissioner
you
infernal
nigger
shouted
letts
as
dr
koomadhi
picked
himself
up
you
infernal
nigger
if
ever
you
show
your
face
here
again
i
ll
break
every
bone
in
your
body
what
the
blazes
is
the
matter
asked
ross
i
believe
that
that
devil
has
killed
mrs
minton
said
the
secretary
if
he
has
by
god
i
ll
kill
xv
dr
koomadhi
went
to
his
house
in
dignified
silence
he
put
a
couple
of
glasses
of
brandy
into
a
bottle
of
champagne
and
gulped
down
the
whole
then
he
wrote
a
short
note
to
the
officer
of
the
houssas
mentioning
that
he
would
be
happy
to
help
him
to
shoot
the
great
ape
at
daybreak
he
sent
off
the
letter
and
before
he
closed
his
desk
he
thought
he
would
restore
the
carved
stones
to
their
receptacle
he
had
put
them
into
his
pocket
before
starting
for
the
residency
but
now
when
he
felt
for
them
in
his
pocket
he
failed
to
find
them
he
was
overcome
with
the
fear
that
he
had
lost
them
it
suddenly
occurred
to
him
that
they
had
been
thrown
out
of
his
pocket
by
the
violence
of
the
man
who
had
flung
him
into
the
road
if
so
they
would
be
lying
on
the
pathway
and
they
would
be
safe
enough
there
until
dark
when
he
could
go
and
search
for
them
at
moonrise
he
went
out
and
walked
down
the
road
to
the
residency
but
when
just
at
the
porch
he
was
confronted
by
ross
who
was
leaving
the
house
hallo
cried
the
surgeon
i
was
just
about
to
stroll
up
to
and
i
was
determined
not
to
miss
you
said
koomadhi
how
is
mrs
minton
it
will
be
brain
fever
i
m
it
looks
very
like
it
said
ross
she
is
delirious
how
did
the
attack
come
that
fool
of
a
secretary
will
give
no
explanation
of
his
conduct
to
you
the
commissioner
says
he
will
either
apologise
or
leave
the
the
secretary
is
a
fool
said
koomadhi
great
heavens
to
think
that
there
are
still
some
men
like
that
steeped
to
the
lips
in
prejudice
against
the
race
to
which
i
am
proud
to
belong
we
ll
not
talk
of
him
but
i
ll
certainly
demand
an
apology
the
poor
woman
she
is
little
more
than
a
girl
ross
the
breaking
strain
was
reached
when
she
was
in
the
act
of
telling
me
about
her
sunstroke
i
suppose
undoubtedly
he
has
been
behaving
queerly
for
some
time
walk
back
with
me
and
have
something
to
i
can
only
stay
for
an
hour
said
ross
mrs
bryson
the
wife
of
the
telegraphist
is
nursing
mrs
minton
but
it
won
t
do
for
me
to
be
absent
for
he
remained
chatting
with
koomadhi
for
about
an
hour
and
then
left
for
the
residency
alone
dr
koomadhi
determined
to
wait
until
midnight
when
he
might
be
pretty
certain
that
his
search
for
the
stones
would
not
be
interrupted
the
door
of
the
residency
was
opened
for
mr
ross
by
letts
step
this
way
ross
said
he
in
a
low
voice
ross
went
into
the
secretary
s
room
sitting
on
a
cane
chair
with
a
cigar
in
his
mouth
and
a
tall
glass
at
his
elbow
was
a
man
from
whom
came
a
strong
perfume
of
the
man
had
plainly
been
recently
shaved
his
face
was
very
smooth
hallo
ross
old
chap
said
this
man
my
god
it
s
minton
cried
the
surgeon
no
one
else
said
minton
what
is
all
this
about
my
poor
wife
don
t
tell
me
that
it
s
it
s
serious
enough
said
ross
but
unless
a
change
for
the
worse
comes
before
morning
there
is
no
reason
for
thank
god
said
minton
what
a
fool
i
was
to
set
about
investigating
that
monkey
language
i
fancied
that
i
had
mastered
a
word
or
two
and
i
ventured
into
the
jungle
and
got
lost
i
returned
here
an
hour
ago
in
a
woful
state
of
dilapidation
i
m
getting
better
every
minute
for
god
s
sake
let
me
know
how
my
poor
wife
is
now
i
ll
get
your
report
ross
to
save
your
leaving
the
room
said
letts
the
secretary
took
the
surgeon
into
an
empty
apartment
he
returned
of
an
hour
ago
he
said
in
a
low
voice
i
never
got
such
a
shock
as
when
i
saw
him
luckily
i
was
at
the
door
he
was
practically
naked
and
with
his
hair
tangled
over
his
head
and
his
face
one
mass
of
bristles
he
was
to
all
intents
and
purposes
a
baboon
that
nigger
is
at
the
bottom
of
it
all
i
followed
him
when
he
visited
mrs
minton
this
morning
and
i
even
brought
myself
to
listen
outside
the
door
of
the
where
they
had
an
interview
i
overheard
enough
to
convince
me
that
the
ruffian
had
made
minton
the
victim
of
some
of
his
hellish
magic
i
ve
been
long
enough
on
the
west
coast
to
know
what
some
of
the
niggers
can
do
in
this
way
i
have
questioned
minton
adroitly
and
he
admitted
to
me
that
koomadhi
had
put
a
certain
stone
carved
like
a
human
ear
into
his
hand
and
had
induced
him
to
place
it
at
his
own
ear
that
was
the
famous
sacred
ear
stone
that
the
ashantees
speak
of
in
we
ll
talk
more
of
this
said
ross
i
don
t
believe
much
in
negro
magic
but
my
god
what
is
the
meaning
of
that
a
window
was
open
in
the
room
and
through
it
there
came
the
sound
of
a
shot
followed
by
appalling
yells
then
came
another
shot
and
such
a
wild
chorus
of
shrieking
as
far
surpassed
in
volume
the
first
series
xvi
letts
ran
to
a
cupboard
and
whipped
out
a
revolver
he
rushed
outside
without
a
word
ross
followed
him
he
felt
that
wherever
a
revolver
was
going
he
should
go
also
the
two
men
ran
in
the
moonlight
toward
koomadhi
s
house
for
the
yells
were
still
coming
from
that
direction
when
they
got
within
sight
of
the
house
letts
cried
out
in
amazement
by
the
light
of
the
full
moon
the
strangest
sight
that
he
had
ever
seen
was
before
his
eyes
koomadhi
s
house
was
invisible
but
where
it
should
have
been
there
was
an
enormous
pyramid
of
jabbering
apes
they
were
so
thick
upon
the
roof
and
the
verandah
as
to
conceal
every
portion
of
the
building
and
hundreds
were
on
the
pathway
around
the
place
the
noise
they
made
was
appalling
letts
and
the
surgeon
crouched
behind
a
and
watched
that
strange
scene
but
they
had
not
been
long
in
concealment
before
the
creatures
began
trooping
off
to
the
jungle
baboons
chimpanzees
and
gorillas
more
horrible
than
had
ever
been
depicted
were
rushing
from
the
house
yelling
and
gibbering
with
grotesque
gestures
beneath
the
light
of
the
moon
before
the
last
of
the
monstrous
procession
had
disappeared
while
the
shrieks
of
the
wild
parrots
were
still
filling
the
air
the
two
men
left
their
place
of
concealment
and
hurried
toward
the
house
they
had
to
struggle
through
an
odour
of
monkeys
that
would
have
overpowered
most
men
a
glance
was
sufficient
to
show
them
that
the
shutters
of
the
room
in
which
koomadhi
slept
had
been
torn
away
letts
sprang
through
the
open
window
and
boss
heard
his
cry
of
horror
before
he
followed
him
before
he
saw
the
ghastly
sight
that
the
moonlight
revealed
the
body
of
dr
koomadhi
lay
torn
and
mangled
upon
the
floor
his
empty
revolver
still
warm
in
his
hand
around
him
lay
the
carcases
of
four
enormous
apes
with
in
their
breasts
ross
said
letts
after
a
long
pause
there
is
a
stronger
power
still
than
the
devil
even
on
the
west
coast
of
women
i
have
often
heard
have
strange
notions
at
times
said
major
minton
leaning
over
the
under
the
awning
of
the
where
his
wife
was
sitting
but
that
fancy
which
you
say
you
had
before
your
attack
beats
the
record
still
i
was
greatly
to
blame
i
ll
never
forgive
myself
i
had
no
business
interesting
myself
in
that
simian
jabber
if
at
any
time
i
feel
a
craving
in
such
a
direction
i
ll
get
an
order
for
the
strangers
gallery
of
the
house
of
commons
when
a
debate
on
an
irish
question
is
going
on
poor
koomadhi
letts
declared
that
as
he
lay
among
the
dead
apes
it
was
difficult
to
say
whether
he
was
an
ape
or
a
the
ghost
of
barmouth
manor
i
wouldn
t
make
a
fuss
about
it
if
i
were
you
said
charlie
craven
pursuing
that
search
from
pocket
to
pocket
which
men
having
no
particular
reputation
for
tidiness
to
maintain
are
accustomed
to
institute
when
they
have
filled
a
pipe
and
are
anxious
to
light
it
a
fuss
about
it
cried
his
sister
madge
a
fuss
good
gracious
what
is
there
to
make
a
fuss
about
in
all
that
i
have
told
you
a
dream
i
ask
you
candidly
if
you
think
that
i
am
the
sort
of
girl
to
make
a
fuss
over
a
dream
oh
i
don
t
know
said
charlie
he
had
succeeded
in
finding
in
one
of
his
pockets
a
an
empty
well
you
should
know
said
madge
severely
there
now
you
are
making
a
fuss
over
something
a
deal
flimsier
than
your
dream
laughed
her
brother
i
wonder
if
that
palace
of
your
dream
was
no
better
supplied
than
this
house
with
matches
if
it
wasn
t
i
shouldn
t
care
to
live
in
it
for
any
length
of
it
s
so
like
a
man
to
keep
on
bothering
himself
and
every
one
about
him
for
a
match
while
all
the
time
a
fire
is
roaring
on
the
hearth
behind
him
and
his
pockets
are
full
of
bills
the
usual
christmas
bills
the
least
of
which
would
light
all
the
pipes
he
smokes
in
a
day
and
that
s
saying
a
good
how
clever
you
are
i
never
thought
of
the
fire
well
as
i
was
remarking
i
wouldn
t
bother
telling
my
dreams
to
any
one
if
i
were
you
dreams
well
dreams
are
all
rot
you
i
m
not
quite
so
sure
of
that
as
you
seem
to
be
o
wisest
of
brothers
the
wisest
of
people
in
the
world
next
to
you
of
course
have
thought
that
there
was
something
in
dreams
haven
t
they
they
were
wrong
my
aunt
the
rot
that
i
have
dreamt
from
time
to
time
oh
that
settles
the
it
does
so
far
as
i
am
concerned
look
here
madge
don
t
come
to
me
again
with
the
story
of
your
dreams
hoping
to
find
a
sympathetic
ear
dreams
i
say
are
all
of
course
you
saw
that
particular
house
and
that
particular
staircase
in
some
picture
and
they
stuck
somewhere
at
the
back
of
your
brain
it
s
a
rummy
thing
the
brain
you
know
a
jolly
rum
thing
it
is
i
am
becoming
more
impressed
every
minute
with
the
truth
of
that
discovery
of
oh
if
you
are
becoming
sarcastic
i
have
nothing
more
to
say
but
please
to
remember
that
sarcasm
is
no
argument
i
tell
you
my
dear
girl
you
have
seen
a
picture
of
that
house
at
some
period
of
your
life
i
don
t
say
recently
mind
you
and
my
theory
is
that
the
brain
is
like
a
sensitized
plate
it
records
an
impression
once
and
for
all
and
stores
it
away
and
you
never
know
exactly
when
it
means
to
bring
it
out
again
before
your
eyes
oh
believe
me
it
plays
a
lot
of
tricks
upon
even
the
most
commonplace
among
whom
i
suppose
i
must
count
myself
well
i
daresay
you
are
i
know
that
i
am
right
dreams
did
you
ever
hear
the
story
of
the
old
woman
who
won
a
big
prize
in
a
lottery
the
ticket
being
no
had
she
chosen
that
number
on
chance
or
in
accordance
with
some
system
she
was
asked
and
she
replied
that
she
had
dreamt
it
all
out
dreamt
it
all
out
what
did
she
mean
by
that
they
inquired
well
a
week
ago
i
dreamt
that
i
won
the
prize
and
that
the
ticket
i
took
was
no
said
she
the
next
night
i
dreamt
exactly
the
same
and
the
ticket
was
no
the
third
night
the
same
thing
happened
so
of
course
i
chose
no
no
why
not
no
as
you
dreamt
it
the
people
asked
oh
you
fools
said
she
didn
t
i
tell
you
that
i
dreamt
it
three
times
the
number
was
and
doesn
t
every
one
know
that
three
times
are
now
that
s
the
stuff
that
dreams
are
made
of
as
shakespeare
remarks
so
don
t
you
bother
about
this
particular
vision
of
yours
and
if
you
take
my
advice
you
ll
say
nothing
to
uncle
philip
or
the
lot
of
them
about
it
they
would
only
laugh
at
why
on
earth
should
i
go
about
proclaiming
my
dream
to
all
our
relations
cried
the
girl
dear
charlie
i
m
not
suffering
just
yet
from
softening
of
the
brain
besides
i
can
recall
many
instances
of
disaster
following
people
who
bored
others
with
the
story
of
their
dreams
there
was
the
notable
case
of
joseph
and
his
brethren
and
later
in
history
there
was
the
case
of
the
duke
of
clarence
you
remember
how
swiftly
retribution
followed
his
story
of
his
dream
now
of
course
my
dream
was
only
a
little
insignificant
thing
compared
to
joseph
s
and
clarence
s
still
something
might
happen
if
i
bored
people
with
it
something
proportionate
the
might
come
to
the
table
in
a
state
of
squash
or
the
custards
might
be
smoked
oh
no
i
ll
be
forewarned
and
talk
only
of
facts
i
suppose
a
dream
can
not
by
even
the
most
indulgent
of
people
be
called
a
i
m
off
to
the
stables
said
her
brother
after
a
little
pause
then
he
went
off
to
the
stables
he
was
an
excellent
fellow
and
the
best
of
brothers
although
he
was
more
at
home
in
the
stables
than
when
engaged
in
a
discussion
on
a
subject
involving
some
exercise
of
the
imagination
there
is
not
much
room
in
a
stable
for
a
play
of
the
imagination
especially
where
the
corn
accounts
are
kept
on
a
system
when
he
had
left
the
on
this
bright
christmas
morning
his
sister
paused
for
a
few
moments
in
her
morning
duty
of
collecting
a
breakfast
for
the
birds
which
were
loitering
about
the
italian
balustrade
in
front
of
the
window
reminding
her
in
their
own
way
that
they
expected
an
exceptionally
liberal
repast
on
this
christmas
morning
she
paused
and
began
to
think
once
more
upon
this
strange
dream
of
hers
which
she
had
been
rehearsing
to
her
brother
after
all
it
was
not
so
strange
a
dream
she
reflected
the
only
queer
thing
about
it
was
that
it
had
come
to
her
on
every
christmas
eve
for
five
consecutive
years
since
she
was
seventeen
and
that
its
details
did
not
differ
in
the
least
from
one
year
to
another
perhaps
it
was
also
different
from
the
majority
of
dreams
in
its
vividness
and
in
the
fact
that
on
awaking
from
it
she
felt
as
exhausted
as
if
she
had
just
returned
from
a
long
journey
even
now
it
required
almost
an
effort
on
her
part
to
walk
round
the
old
oak
table
sweeping
the
crumbs
on
to
a
plate
to
throw
to
the
birds
and
when
she
had
discharged
this
duty
she
seated
herself
with
a
sigh
of
relief
in
one
of
the
that
stood
by
the
side
of
the
great
wood
fire
she
closed
her
eyes
and
once
again
recalled
her
dream
she
had
no
difficulty
in
doing
so
she
had
fancied
herself
in
the
act
of
driving
up
to
a
fine
old
house
standing
in
the
middle
of
a
park
of
oak
and
chestnut
the
lawn
extended
across
the
full
front
of
the
mansion
and
in
the
centre
she
noticed
a
beautiful
old
fountain
composed
of
a
great
marble
basin
with
a
splendid
group
of
figures
in
the
centre
neptune
with
his
dolphins
and
a
naiad
or
two
she
passed
into
the
house
through
a
great
hall
hung
with
trophies
of
war
and
of
the
chase
in
front
of
her
was
the
enormous
head
of
a
moose
and
at
one
side
there
was
a
great
grey
skull
of
some
animal
such
as
she
had
never
seen
before
a
fearful
thing
with
huge
tusks
quite
the
monster
of
a
dream
then
she
seemed
to
go
from
room
to
room
as
if
she
had
been
a
member
of
the
family
living
in
the
place
but
and
this
she
felt
to
be
a
true
the
moment
she
entered
a
room
every
one
who
was
there
fled
from
her
but
apparently
this
did
not
cause
her
any
surprise
any
more
than
did
the
strange
costume
of
the
figures
who
fled
at
her
approach
costumes
of
the
sixteenth
century
mingled
with
those
of
the
seventeenth
and
eighteenth
thinking
of
the
figures
hurrying
from
every
room
suggested
to
her
the
family
portraits
of
three
centuries
in
motion
after
visiting
several
fine
rooms
she
found
herself
walking
up
a
broad
oaken
staircase
of
shallow
steps
until
she
came
to
a
large
lobby
where
the
staircase
divided
to
right
and
left
there
she
found
a
curious
settee
of
some
dark
wood
the
long
centre
panel
of
which
was
carved
with
many
figures
she
saw
all
this
by
the
aid
of
the
moonlight
which
flowed
in
through
the
panes
of
coloured
glass
in
a
high
window
painted
with
many
coats
of
arms
she
remembered
having
rested
in
this
seat
for
some
time
feeling
very
lonely
and
then
some
one
had
come
to
her
sitting
by
her
side
and
taking
her
hand
saying
i
have
been
waiting
for
you
all
these
years
i
am
so
glad
that
you
are
here
at
she
remembered
that
the
sound
of
the
voice
and
the
touch
of
the
hand
had
banished
her
loneliness
and
made
her
feel
happier
than
she
had
ever
felt
in
all
her
life
before
even
now
she
felt
supremely
happy
recalling
this
incident
of
her
dream
though
she
recollected
that
she
had
not
yet
seen
the
face
of
the
man
who
had
come
to
her
to
banish
her
loneliness
she
wished
that
her
dream
had
been
less
whimsical
in
this
one
particular
she
felt
that
she
could
have
spared
some
of
the
other
details
that
came
before
her
so
vividly
the
skull
of
that
strange
animal
that
hung
in
the
hall
for
instance
if
in
their
place
she
had
been
allowed
to
see
what
manner
of
man
it
was
who
had
sat
with
her
still
the
recollection
of
him
gave
her
pleasure
even
when
the
dream
had
first
come
to
her
and
he
had
come
in
the
dream
and
this
pleasure
had
been
increasing
year
by
year
until
she
knew
that
she
had
actually
gone
asleep
on
the
previous
night
full
of
joy
in
the
hope
of
hearing
the
sound
of
that
voice
and
feeling
the
touch
of
that
hand
as
she
had
done
in
the
past
and
that
was
the
end
of
her
dream
unless
the
feeling
of
happiness
happiness
mingled
with
a
certain
sadness
of
which
she
was
conscious
while
she
recalled
its
details
should
be
accounted
part
of
the
dream
her
pleasure
was
the
same
as
one
experiences
in
recalling
the
incidents
of
a
visit
to
a
dear
friend
her
sadness
was
the
same
as
one
experiences
on
thinking
that
a
long
time
must
elapse
before
one
can
see
that
friend
again
madge
actually
found
herself
reflecting
that
a
year
must
pass
before
she
could
once
more
find
herself
wandering
through
the
strange
mansion
of
her
dream
find
herself
once
more
seated
on
that
carved
seat
in
the
lobby
beneath
the
painted
window
she
kept
on
thinking
and
wondering
as
she
thought
over
the
strange
features
of
this
experience
of
hers
she
knew
that
she
was
what
people
would
call
a
commonplace
practical
girl
a
girl
without
fads
or
fancies
of
any
sort
since
her
mother
s
death
three
years
before
she
had
managed
all
the
household
affairs
of
craven
court
for
her
brother
who
had
inherited
the
property
before
she
had
left
the
schoolroom
every
one
was
bound
to
acknowledge
that
her
management
of
the
household
had
been
admirable
though
only
her
brother
knew
exactly
how
admirable
it
was
there
are
no
frills
about
madge
she
is
the
best
woman
of
business
in
the
county
and
we
have
none
of
the
bothers
of
other
people
with
our
servants
he
had
frequently
said
and
yet
here
was
this
embodiment
of
all
that
is
practical
in
life
dreaming
upon
a
dream
upon
this
bright
and
frosty
christmas
morning
and
actually
feeling
sad
at
the
thought
that
a
whole
year
must
elapse
before
the
same
vision
should
return
to
her
the
chiming
of
the
church
bells
startled
her
out
of
her
reverie
pshaw
she
cried
jumping
up
from
her
chair
i
am
quite
as
great
a
goose
as
charlie
believes
me
to
be
quite
or
i
should
not
have
told
him
that
that
dream
had
come
to
me
again
i
should
have
had
the
sense
to
know
that
he
would
have
the
sense
to
know
that
dreams
are
one
and
all
the
utterest
folly
she
knew
that
she
was
trying
to
convince
herself
that
there
was
nothing
more
in
this
particular
dream
than
in
the
many
casual
dreams
that
came
to
her
as
well
as
to
other
people
but
before
she
had
reached
the
door
of
the
she
knew
that
she
had
failed
in
her
attempt
the
curious
fatigue
of
which
she
was
conscious
quickly
told
her
that
this
vision
was
not
as
others
were
she
went
to
church
with
her
brother
and
in
the
afternoon
their
uncle
colonel
craven
and
his
wife
duly
arrived
at
the
court
to
spend
their
annual
week
at
the
family
mansion
and
madge
took
her
brother
s
advice
and
refrained
from
saying
a
word
to
either
of
them
on
the
subject
of
her
dream
indeed
she
had
so
much
to
think
of
and
so
much
to
do
during
the
week
she
had
no
time
to
give
to
anything
so
immaterial
as
a
dream
however
interesting
it
might
be
to
herself
on
the
last
morning
of
the
stay
of
colonel
and
mrs
craven
at
craven
court
the
former
received
a
letter
which
he
tossed
across
the
to
charlie
funny
isn
t
it
he
said
we
were
talking
about
no
later
than
last
night
and
here

a
letter
from
jack
tremaine
telling
me
that
he
is
taking
over
his
cousin

place

six
months
and
promising
me
some
good
sport
if
i
go
to
him

a
week

january
you
will
see
that
he
suggests
that

should
be
of
the
party

asks

what
he
says
about
the
who

charlie
and

place

chap
named
clifford
and

dorsetshire
on

coast

available
for
jack
tremaine
asked
charlie
turn
over
the
page
and
you
ll
see
what
he
says
about
the
cliffords
replied
colonel
craven
charlie
found
on
the
last
leaf
half
a
dozen
lines
on
the
point
in
question
jack
tremaine
said
that
mrs
clifford
was
not
satisfied
as
to
the
health
of
her
son
and
was
going
abroad
with
him
during
the
first
week
in
january
i
should
like
to
have
a
go
at
the
ducks
said
charlie
craven
handing
back
the
letter
i
suppose
there
is
a
or
two
at
the
place
you
may
be
sure
of
that
said
his
uncle
young
clifford
is
a
good
sportsman
i
believe
but
i
have
never
met
him
i
ll
write
to
tremaine
telling
him
that
you
are
at
home
i
m
sure
he
means
to
invite
all
doubt
on
this
point
was
removed
by
the
arrival
two
days
later
of
an
invitation
from
mr
tremaine
to
charlie
craven
for
a
fortnight
s
at
barmouth
manor
and
he
enclosed
a
letter
from
his
wife
to
madge
expressing
the
hope
that
she
would
be
able
to
accompany
her
brother
madge
was
delighted
at
the
prospect
of
the
visit
for
she
and
mrs
tremaine
were
close
friends
the
frost
which
had
set
in
a
few
days
before
christmas
had
not
gone
when
she
and
her
brother
were
due
at
barmouth
manor
so
that
there
was
a
likelihood
of
her
having
some
skating
on
the
lake
mrs
tremaine
had
in
her
invitation
laid
some
stress
upon
the
possibility
of
a
week
s
skating
on
the
lake
which
she
said
was
within
the
manor
park
a
carriage
met
them
at
barmouth
station
for
the
manor
was
quite
five
miles
from
the
picturesque
little
town
and
it
was
late
in
the
afternoon
before
they
passed
through
the
spacious
entrance
gates
to
the
manor
park
there
was
however
quite
enough
light
to
enable
madge
to
see
every
detail
of
the
place
and
it
was
observing
some
of
the
details
that
caused
her
to
make
a
rather
startling
exclamation
of
surprise
hallo
said
her
brother
what
has
startled
you
there
was
a
little
pause
before
she
had
recovered
herself
sufficiently
to
be
able
to
make
an
excuse
that
would
sound
plausible
she
pointed
to
a
group
of
deer
looking
over
the
barrier
of
their
enclosure
one
of
the
stags
she
said
it
seemed
for
a
moment
as
if
it
were
about
to
jump
the
what
matter
if
it
did
they
are
as
tame
as
cats
at
this
time
of
the
year
said
charlie
of
course
i
should
have
remembered
she
said
i
wonder
in
what
direction
is
the
pond
does
the
sunset
look
promising
there
may
be
no
thaw
before
the
end
of
the
month
said
he
that
was
the
end
of
their
conversation
and
she
flattered
herself
that
he
had
no
notion
how
excited
she
was
as
the
carriage
reached
that
part
of
the
drive
which
was
beside
the
lawn
and
the
red
level
rays
of
the
sun
streaming
through
the
naked
trees
stained
the
marble
basin
of
an
italian
fountain
the
central
group
of
which
was
in
every
detail
the
same
as
the
figures
in
the
fountain
of
her
dream
in
another
minute
the
front
of
the
house
was
disclosed
and
she
saw
that
it
was
the
house
of
her
dream
she
would
have
been
greatly
disappointed
had
it
been
otherwise
she
entered
the
great
hall
and
could
scarcely
reply
to
the
cordial
greeting
of
her
aunt
and
mrs
tremaine
for
she
found
herself
stared
at
by
the
sleepy
eyes
that
looked
out
from
the
head
of
a
moose
just
as
they
had
stared
at
her
in
her
sleep
she
turned
to
the
wall
on
her
right
yes
there
was
the
curious
skull
with
the
mighty
tusks
oh
yes
we
had
a
delightful
journey
she
managed
to
say
in
reply
to
mrs
tremaine
s
inquiry
thank
you
i
should
like
a
cup
of
tea
immensely
do
you
have
it
in
the
hall
or
in
the
tapestry
room
beyond
what
you
have
been
here
before
i
had
no
idea
of
that
said
mrs
tremaine
for
more
than
a
moment
madge
was
confused
luckily
for
her
however
the
lamps
had
not
been
lighted
in
the
hall
and
the
sudden
flush
that
came
over
her
face
was
unobserved
by
her
friends
she
gave
a
laugh
what
a
good
shot
i
made
she
cried
isn
t
this
just
the
sort
of
house
to
have
an
and
a
tapestry
chamber
beside
it
i
think
we
should
have
tea
here
what
sort
of
prehistoric
creature
is
that
on
the
wall
i
believe
it
is
a
skull
that
was
found
when
they
were
digging
the
foundations
of
one
of
the
lodges
said
mrs
tremaine
i
seem
to
have
read
some
description
of
this
very
place
said
charlie
standing
in
front
of
the
great
skull
madge
wondered
if
he
would
remember
enough
of
her
account
of
the
house
of
her
dreams
to
enable
him
to
recognise
the
details
before
him
it
is
fully
described
in
hall
s
history
and
in
every
of
the
district
the
animal
that
that
skull
belonged
to
lived
some
thousands
of
years
before
the
flood
i
what
is
the
exact
date
carved
on
it
laughed
charlie
yes
i
daresay
i
came
upon
a
paragraph
or
an
illustration
of
the
place
no
house
is
safe
from
the
depredations
of
the
magazines
tea
was
served
in
the
hall
to
give
madge
s
maid
time
to
unpack
and
then
the
girl
was
shown
to
her
room
she
ran
up
the
broad
shallow
staircase
to
the
lobby
she
had
made
up
her
mind
to
sit
if
only
for
a
moment
on
the
carved
settee
but
a
surprise
awaited
her
no
carved
settee
was
there
the
painted
window
was
there
but
no
settee
was
beneath
it
she
was
so
surprised
that
she
stood
for
some
moments
gazing
at
the
vacant
place
that
lobby
looks
quite
bare
without
the
settee
miss
craven
said
the
housekeeper
who
was
beside
her
it
s
a
fine
bit
of
carving
all
was
there
a
settee
here
asked
madge
innocently
it
was
only
taken
away
to
be
in
a
better
light
for
mrs
tremaine
to
photograph
it
said
the
housekeeper
mrs
tremaine
has
done
most
of
the
rare
pieces
in
the
house
this
is
your
room
miss
craven
it
s
called
the
dauphin
s
chamber
for
it
was
here
he
slept
fifty
years
ago
when
he
was
in
madge
entered
the
room
remarking
that
it
was
beautifully
furnished
and
that
it
seemed
extremely
comfortable
when
the
door
was
closed
she
threw
herself
into
a
chair
and
had
a
good
think
what
could
it
all
mean
she
asked
herself
why
should
this
house
become
so
associated
with
her
life
was
she
going
to
die
here
was
something
going
to
happen
to
her
was
she
to
meet
here
the
man
who
had
upon
five
different
occasions
come
to
her
side
telling
her
that
he
had
been
waiting
for
her
for
ten
days
she
remained
in
the
house
looking
forward
day
by
day
to
some
occurrence
that
would
cause
her
to
realise
what
her
dream
meant
but
she
returned
with
her
brother
to
craven
court
in
disappointment
nothing
particular
happened
all
the
time
and
she
came
to
the
conclusion
that
her
dream
was
as
meaningless
as
her
brother
had
said
it
was
madge
craven
and
her
brother
were
staying
with
the
tremaines
at
their
own
place
during
the
pheasant
shooting
the
following
october
and
one
morning
their
hostess
mentioned
that
her
husband
s
cousin
mrs
clifford
had
returned
to
england
from
south
america
and
was
expected
to
join
their
party
that
day
she
arrived
before
the
shooters
had
come
back
from
their
day
s
sport
and
she
and
mrs
tremaine
had
a
long
chat
in
front
of
the
fire
before
tea
mrs
clifford
was
a
handsome
old
lady
of
the
type
and
being
a
close
observer
and
an
admirable
describer
of
all
that
she
observed
she
was
able
to
entertain
mrs
tremaine
with
an
account
of
the
adventures
of
her
son
and
herself
in
south
america
i
hope
rawdon
s
health
is
more
satisfactory
now
than
it
was
said
mrs
tremaine
when
her
guest
had
declared
that
there
was
no
more
to
be
told
i
can
only
hope
for
the
best
said
mrs
clifford
becoming
grave
rawdon
is
gone
across
the
mountains
to
chili
and
will
not
be
at
home
until
the
middle
of
he
must
be
pretty
robust
to
be
able
to
undertake
such
a
journey
said
mrs
tremaine
he
is
not
wanting
in
strength
said
mrs
clifford
only
poor
boy
poor
boy
why
poor
boy
asked
the
other
there
was
a
pause
before
the
elder
lady
said
it
is
rather
difficult
to
explain
by
the
way
did
any
of
your
party
at
the
manor
house
see
the
ghost
heavens
i
did
not
know
that
your
family
was
blessed
with
a
ghost
laughed
mrs
tremaine
no
i
can
assure
you
we
were
not
so
lucky
what
sort
of
a
ghost
is
it
a
ghastly
figure
with
rattling
chains
have
you
seen
it
yes
i
have
seen
it
said
mrs
clifford
in
a
low
voice
how
interesting
do
tell
me
what
it
is
like
cried
the
other
like
what
is
it
like
mrs
clifford
rose
slowly
from
her
chair
and
walked
to
another
chair
she
only
remained
seated
for
a
moment
however
with
a
sigh
she
began
pacing
the
room
slowly
i
fear
i
have
touched
upon
a
forbidden
topic
said
mrs
tremaine
i
had
no
idea
that
you
were
serious
serious
said
mrs
clifford
she
was
still
pacing
the
room
and
had
just
reached
the
window
when
she
spoke
the
next
moment
she
had
uttered
a
cry
mrs
tremaine
saw
that
she
was
staring
out
of
the
window
her
hands
grasping
the
back
of
a
chair
she
was
by
her
side
in
a
moment
pray
what
is
the
matter
she
said
you
are
weak
overcome
by
me
ring
for
mrs
clifford
clutched
her
suddenly
by
the
arm
who
is
that
that
on
the
terrace
she
said
in
a
fearful
whisper
who
why
that
is
our
cousin
madge
craven
replied
mrs
tremaine
madge
was
standing
on
the
terrace
bareheaded
tossing
grain
to
the
peacocks
she
was
with
you
when
you
were
at
the
manor
house
said
mrs
clifford
she
was
there
and
yet
you
did
not
see
the
ghost
what
on
earth
do
you
mean
said
mrs
tremaine
i
mean
this
that
girl
out
there
is
the
ghost
that
appears
at
the
manor
house
every
christmas
eve
and
it
is
because
my
poor
boy
as
well
as
i
myself
saw
it
that
his
mind
has
become
heavens
you
mean
to
say
the
poor
boy
has
fallen
in
love
with
a
shadow
a
phantom
it
comes
every
christmas
eve
and
walks
from
room
to
room
it
comes
up
the
stairs
i
tell
you
that
i
have
seen
it
and
sits
on
the
old
carved
settee
and
then
suddenly
vanishes
into
the
air
whence
it
came
and
that
ghost
is
as
surely
that
girl
as
i
am
this
is
terrible
quite
uncanny
are
you
quite
sure
sure
sure
it
is
awful
to
think
upon
but
but
listen
to
me
i
have
an
idea
if
madge
is
the
ghost
why
not
ask
her
down
again
to
your
place
and
give
rawdon
a
thing
of
flesh
and
blood
to
transfer
his
affections
to
what
do
you
say
madge
is
the
best
girl
in
the
world
every
eligible
man
in
her
county
and
quite
as
many
ineligible
have
wanted
to
marry
her
you
will
find
out
how
nice
she
mrs
clifford
sank
into
the
chair
oh
that
it
were
possible
she
whispered
he
is
everything
to
me
my
dearest
boy
and
until
this
fancy
oh
if
it
were
only
possible
and
at
this
point
madge
entered
the
room
and
was
duly
presented
to
mrs
clifford
if
madge
was
at
first
under
the
impression
that
the
manner
of
mrs
clifford
in
regard
to
her
was
somewhat
formal
and
constrained
before
a
week
had
passed
she
had
good
reason
to
change
her
opinion
on
this
point
the
fact
was
that
mrs
clifford
had
formed
an
attachment
for
her
which
she
could
sincerely
return
and
that
was
why
the
girl
was
delighted
to
accept
her
invitation
to
spend
christmas
in
dorsetshire
it
suited
her
brother
s
arrangements
for
her
to
do
so
for
he
was
anxious
to
join
a
expedition
which
was
starting
for
india
early
in
december
mrs
clifford
said
she
was
delighted
to
be
able
to
have
madge
all
to
herself
for
at
least
a
fortnight
my
son
can
not
possibly
be
home
until
the
middle
of
january
said
she
and
then
we
shall
probably
have
a
large
party
at
the
manor
but
meantime
you
and
i
shall
be
i
do
not
think
that
we
shall
quarrel
said
madge
alas
alas
said
mrs
clifford
to
mrs
tremaine
after
one
of
the
many
whispered
colloquies
which
they
had
together
during
the
week
alas
rawdon
can
not
be
home
for
christmas
it
was
i
who
took
the
greatest
pains
to
arrange
matters
to
prevent
his
spending
another
christmas
eve
at
home
until
he
should
have
completely
recovered
from
the
effects
of
his
strange
attachment
and
yet
now
i
would
give
worlds
to
be
able
to
have
him
with
us
on
christmas
could
you
not
send
a
cable
suggested
mrs
tremaine
i
might
send
a
dozen
without
being
able
to
find
him
besides
it
would
be
impossible
for
me
to
tell
him
what
has
i
suppose
you
could
hardly
cable
him
come
home
at
once
ghost
found
laughed
mrs
tremaine
never
mind
he
should
be
all
the
better
pleased
when
the
ghost
of
christmas
eve
becomes
a
creature
of
flesh
and
blood
by
the
middle
of
it
was
christmas
eve
at
the
manor
house
madge
s
maid
had
just
left
her
for
the
night
but
the
girl
showed
no
inclination
to
go
to
bed
she
remained
sitting
by
her
fire
thinking
how
strange
it
was
that
she
should
be
on
this
christmas
eve
in
the
flesh
at
the
house
which
she
had
visited
in
her
dreams
and
while
she
sat
thinking
over
this
she
found
herself
overcome
by
that
strange
longing
which
she
had
had
just
a
year
ago
to
be
again
by
the
side
of
the
man
who
had
come
to
her
side
in
her
dream
she
clasped
her
hands
saying
in
a
whisper
come
to
me
come
to
me
again
and
tell
me
that
you
have
been
waiting
for
she
began
to
undress
with
feverish
haste
when
suddenly
her
hands
dropped
by
her
sides
for
the
terrible
thought
occurred
to
her
what
if
my
dream
will
not
come
to
me
this
year
because
i
happen
to
be
in
the
midst
of
the
real
scene
where
it
took
place
the
thought
that
it
might
be
as
capricious
as
other
dreams
oppressed
her
she
now
felt
sorry
that
she
had
agreed
to
visit
the
place
she
should
have
remained
at
craven
court
where
her
dream
had
always
been
faithful
to
her
a
sudden
idea
occurred
to
her
she
would
leave
her
room
and
sit
in
reality
on
the
carved
settee
under
the
painted
window
and
then
going
to
bed
immediately
after
she
might
sink
unconsciously
into
the
kind
embrace
of
her
dream
she
opened
her
door
very
gently
and
went
along
the
silent
corridor
until
she
reached
the
head
of
the
staircase
and
saw
the
moonlight
streaming
through
the
coloured
glass
to
the
lobby
beneath
she
stole
down
and
in
another
instant
she
was
in
the
seat
the
moonlight
streaming
over
her
and
throwing
the
coloured
pattern
of
the
glass
upon
her
white
dress
she
closed
her
eyes
feeling
that
perhaps
she
might
fall
asleep
and
find
herself
in
the
midst
of
her
dream
suddenly
she
opened
her
eyes
she
fancied
that
she
heard
the
sound
of
a
footstep
in
the
hall
below
yes
there
could
be
no
doubt
about
it
some
one
was
in
the
hall
some
one
was
coming
up
the
stairs
she
sprang
to
her
feet
and
was
about
to
rush
up
to
her
room
when
she
heard
a
voice
the
voice
that
she
had
heard
so
often
in
that
dream
of
hers
saying
ah
do
not
go
now
you
can
not
go
now
that
i
have
come
to
you
now
that
i
have
been
waiting
for
you
for
five
she
could
not
move
from
where
she
was
standing
she
saw
a
tall
man
with
a
bronzed
face
coming
up
the
stairs
she
somehow
had
never
seen
his
face
in
her
dream
but
she
recognised
it
from
the
photograph
which
his
mother
had
shown
her
she
knew
that
the
man
was
rawdon
clifford
he
stood
before
her
on
the
lobby
they
thought
to
separate
us
he
said
they
thought
that
my
love
for
you
was
a
form
of
madness
but
i
tell
you
as
i
told
them
i
would
rather
stand
by
your
side
for
a
few
minutes
once
than
be
for
ever
by
the
side
of
another
a
more
real
creature
that
is
why
i
have
come
over
land
and
sea
to
be
here
in
time
for
your
visit
this
christmas
eve
i
promised
my
mother
to
stay
away
but
i
could
not
i
could
not
keep
my
promise
and
i
came
to
england
a
fortnight
sooner
than
i
expected
and
entered
the
house
only
this
moment
like
a
burglar
but
i
am
i
do
not
understand
i
am
mrs
clifford
s
guest
madge
craven
is
my
name
said
madge
the
man
sprang
back
and
raised
his
hands
in
surprise
great
heavens
she
is
flesh
and
blood
at
last
at
last
he
cried
he
put
out
his
hand
slowly
doubtfully
madge
put
out
hers
to
it
a
cry
of
delight
came
from
him
as
he
felt
her
warm
hand
and
he
made
it
still
warmer
by
his
kisses
she
could
not
stop
him
she
made
no
attempt
to
do
so
tell
me
that
i
was
not
mad
that
i
am
not
mad
now
he
said
in
a
loving
whisper
oh
no
only
is
it
not
strange
for
five
years
i
have
this
dream
this
very
dream
and
yet
i
never
was
in
this
house
until
last
january
said
madge
you
have
been
with
me
every
christmas
eve
for
five
years
and
you
will
remain
here
for
ever
said
he
do
not
tell
me
that
we
have
not
met
before
do
not
tell
me
that
you
have
not
loved
me
as
i
have
loved
you
all
these
years
what
did
that
dream
of
yours
mean
i
think
i
know
now
now
whispered
the
girl
mrs
tremaine
considers
herself
the
only
survivor
of
the
people
who
professed
to
exorcise
the
ghosts
in
whom
our
grandfathers
were
foolish
enough
to
believe
the
blood
oranges
ah
my
friend
said
the
marchesa
you
englishmen
are
like
to
our
mountain
which
we
see
smoking
over
she
threw
herself
into
the
attitude
of
the
donna
in
an
impassioned
moment
preceding
the
singing
of
the
romanza
as
she
pointed
across
the
blue
bay
of
naples
to
where
vesuvius
was
sending
forth
a
delicate
hazy
fume
i
don
t
know
anything
about
englishmen
said
sir
percival
morosely
but
i
know
that
when
you
are
near
me
my
heart
is
a
volcano
my
soul
the
lady
s
laugh
interrupted
him
one
can
not
make
use
of
similes
with
a
poetical
flavour
about
them
when
a
lady
is
leaning
back
her
head
in
laughter
even
though
the
action
displays
a
beautiful
throat
and
the
curves
of
a
superb
neck
the
marchesa
del
grippo
displayed
a
marvellous
throat
and
neck
and
was
fully
aware
of
this
fact
her
laugh
rang
out
like
a
soprano
dwelling
with
delight
on
a
high
note
and
producing
it
ah
she
cried
you
are
at
pains
to
prove
to
me
that
i
am
right
in
the
way
i
judge
you
englishmen
you
are
volcanic
we
find
not
the
blaze
and
the
thunder
but
only
a
puff
of
once
again
she
pointed
but
this
time
carelessly
in
the
direction
of
the
mountain
the
man
frowned
for
heaven
s
sake
do
not
say
you
englishmen
when
i
am
by
he
cried
i
have
nothing
in
common
with
i
have
never
met
an
englishman
who
did
not
try
to
impress
upon
me
that
he
was
not
as
other
englishmen
said
the
marchesa
the
last
one
to
say
so
to
me
was
your
wicked
young
lord
byron
the
guicciola
presented
him
to
me
at
genoa
heavens
the
old
count
is
more
like
an
englishman
than
lord
byron
he
can
keep
his
eyes
fast
shut
when
it
suits
him
enough
i
said
you
englishmen
and
he
became
red
with
anger
droll
i
had
to
ask
forgiveness
for
having
accused
his
lordship
of
being
english
oh
you
are
a
nation
of
you
do
not
mean
to
keep
up
the
acquaintance
of
lord
byron
i
would
fain
hope
said
sir
percival
with
another
frown
again
the
lady
laughed
after
that
do
not
tell
me
that
you
are
not
an
englishman
she
said
it
is
so
very
english
to
frown
when
the
name
of
lord
byron
is
mentioned
to
give
a
young
woman
with
a
husband
a
solemn
warning
to
beware
of
that
wicked
young
noble
while
all
the
time
the
one
that
utters
the
warning
is
doing
his
best
to
earn
the
reputation
of
the
disreputable
byron
the
english
detest
byron
but
if
you
want
to
flatter
an
englishman
to
the
farthest
point
all
you
have
to
do
is
to
tell
him
that
you
believe
him
to
be
a
second
lord
byron
never
mind
i
like
the
lord
byron
and
i
like
yes
a
little
another
of
his
countrymen
though
he
is
i
fear
very
wicked
wicked
cried
sir
percival
he
was
plainly
flattered
what
is
it
to
be
wicked
ah
do
not
ask
me
to
give
it
a
definition
i
might
say
that
it
was
to
be
you
you
if
it
is
wicked
to
love
madly
blindly
then
indeed
i
admit
that
that
you
are
diabolus
aut
byron
i
know
not
which
of
the
two
the
english
regard
as
the
worse
well
suppose
i
do
not
admit
your
right
to
tell
me
of
your
love
i
suppose
i
dare
not
dispute
your
right
to
love
but
i
can
dispute
your
right
to
tell
me
of
it
that
is
if
it
if
it
exists
heavens
my
beloved
creature
would
i
have
followed
you
here
from
england
if
i
did
not
love
you
to
distraction
it
needs
such
extraordinary
on
the
part
of
an
englishman
to
leave
england
for
italy
i
think
you
were
glad
to
make
some
excuse
even
so
feeble
a
one
as
that
of
being
in
love
with
an
italian
woman
to
make
a
journey
to
naples
but
i
forgot
you
were
in
italy
once
before
were
you
not
yes
i
was
in
some
parts
the
north
tuscany
florence
never
here
no
never
never
here
ah
yes
now
i
remember
well
you
said
you
had
never
been
to
sorrento
i
wonder
did
i
hold
out
any
inducement
to
you
to
come
to
sorrento
you
must
have
been
studying
a
map
of
our
bay
for
you
knew
by
name
every
landmark
every
island
when
i
tried
to
be
your
cicerone
just
the
glance
that
he
cast
at
her
after
giving
a
little
start
had
something
of
suspicion
in
it
everyone
knows
the
landmarks
of
the
lovely
bay
of
naples
said
he
but
i
ah
my
beloved
did
you
not
tell
me
all
its
beauties
when
we
first
met
in
london
six
months
ago
had
you
no
idea
that
every
word
which
fell
from
your
lips
even
the
words
in
which
you
described
the
scenery
around
your
home
should
be
burnt
into
my
memory
for
evermore
ah
sweet
one
will
you
never
listen
to
me
does
my
devotion
count
for
nothing
with
you
my
husband
she
whispered
with
a
tremulous
downward
glance
the
glance
of
love
s
surrender
he
knew
it
well
he
was
a
man
of
considerable
experience
of
woman
in
all
her
phases
he
knew
that
he
had
not
been
fooled
by
the
marchesa
did
not
you
tell
me
that
you
detested
him
he
cried
if
a
husband
treats
a
wife
cruelly
as
he
has
treated
you
he
has
wilfully
forfeited
all
claim
to
her
devotion
there
are
some
acts
so
atrocious
that
it
is
impossible
to
find
an
adequate
punishment
for
you
think
that
even
if
the
punishment
were
a
crime
in
the
eyes
of
the
world
it
would
be
sanctified
by
heaven
if
it
were
meted
out
to
a
monster
of
cruelty
the
marchesa
was
looking
at
him
through
eyes
he
saw
that
her
hands
were
clenched
tightly
and
he
did
not
fail
to
notice
how
tumultuously
her
bosom
was
heaving
he
was
exultant
he
had
conquered
that
opportune
word
which
he
had
thrown
in
regarding
her
husband
s
cruelty
had
overcome
her
last
scruple
she
was
his
my
beloved
my
beloved
he
whispered
cruelty
to
such
a
woman
as
you
makes
sacred
the
mission
of
avenging
it
you
will
leave
him
with
me
you
will
never
know
aught
save
she
gave
a
little
laugh
and
then
put
her
hand
in
his
not
doubtfully
but
with
an
expression
of
the
amplest
trustfulness
my
last
scruple
is
gone
said
she
in
the
same
low
tone
that
he
had
employed
what
you
have
said
has
made
my
mind
you
will
come
to
me
till
one
of
us
she
spoke
the
words
with
the
fire
flashing
from
her
eyes
as
she
gazed
into
his
face
the
force
of
that
gaze
of
hers
gave
him
a
little
shock
it
was
only
a
momentary
sensation
however
in
a
second
he
recollected
that
he
was
talking
to
an
italian
not
an
englishwoman
till
one
of
us
dies
till
one
of
us
dies
he
whispered
poorly
imitating
her
intensity
ah
i
knew
that
it
would
come
my
darling
would
i
have
travelled
from
england
if
i
had
not
been
certain
of
you
certain
of
my
own
love
for
you
i
mean
and
you
will
come
with
me
you
will
leave
him
it
is
his
punishment
his
righteous
i
shall
leave
him
with
you
i
swear
to
you
cried
the
marchesa
for
a
moment
he
failed
to
catch
her
exact
meaning
he
did
not
want
the
marchese
to
be
left
with
him
but
of
course
he
perceived
the
next
instant
that
she
meant
to
say
that
she
would
leave
her
husband
and
go
with
him
her
lover
and
there
was
no
tremor
in
his
voice
as
he
said
you
will
never
repent
it
ah
what
happiness
will
be
ours
my
soul
shall
it
be
tomorrow
i
can
hire
a
vessel
to
take
us
to
malta
there
we
shall
be
nay
it
is
too
sudden
said
she
my
husband
could
not
fail
to
have
his
suspicions
aroused
nay
we
shall
have
to
await
our
opportunity
if
he
asks
you
to
pay
us
a
visit
you
must
come
he
will
be
going
to
rome
in
a
day
or
two
and
i
shall
contrive
to
be
left
ah
that
will
be
our
chance
he
cried
fate
is
on
our
side
my
dear
yes
fate
is
on
our
side
she
said
in
a
low
tone
that
could
not
possibly
reach
the
ear
of
the
tall
and
straight
man
who
approached
them
as
they
stood
at
the
balustrade
of
the
villa
galeotto
overlooking
the
lovely
bay
of
naples
it
is
such
a
great
pleasure
to
me
to
meet
you
once
again
sir
percival
cleave
said
the
marchese
with
a
smile
i
hope
that
the
marchesa
has
offered
you
the
hospitality
of
our
humble
home
the
marchesa
has
been
so
very
kind
as
suggest
that
i
should
visit
your
castle
for
an
hour
or
two
before
i
leave
this
lovely
neighbourhood
said
sir
percival
nay
surely
she
made
you
name
the
day
said
the
marchese
turning
to
his
wife
is
it
possible
my
dear
that
you
failed
to
be
more
specific
he
asked
with
great
gravity
the
lady
gave
a
shrug
in
response
and
her
husband
became
still
more
grave
the
hospitality
which
i
received
in
england
can
never
be
forgotten
by
me
though
my
mission
was
an
unpleasant
one
said
he
the
king
of
naples
but
we
will
avoid
politics
as
people
must
if
they
mean
to
remain
good
friends
enough
you
will
honour
us
by
paying
us
a
visit
but
when
what
day
will
suit
your
convenience
i
am
only
remaining
in
this
neighbourhood
for
a
day
or
two
said
sir
percival
i
have
alas
some
important
business
that
will
take
me
northward
but
well
i
have
no
engagement
if
that
day
would
suit
your
it
will
suit
me
better
than
any
other
day
replied
the
marchese
i
have
myself
to
go
to
rome
almost
at
once
i
shall
never
cease
to
be
thankful
to
fate
for
having
so
delayed
my
departure
as
to
enable
me
to
have
the
pleasure
of
meeting
sir
percival
cleave
you
will
come
in
the
afternoon
and
eat
a
simple
dinner
at
our
table
you
are
already
acquainted
with
the
road
to
the
castle
oh
yes
that
is
no
i
do
not
know
the
road
but
i
do
not
suppose
i
shall
have
any
difficulty
in
finding
it
what
the
marchese
had
turned
once
more
to
his
wife
and
had
assumed
the
tone
of
a
reproof
what
you
did
not
make
sir
percival
aware
of
the
direction
to
the
castle
sir
percival
has
been
studying
a
map
of
the
bay
said
she
though
he
has
never
before
been
here
he
shows
a
remarkable
acquaintance
with
the
it
is
not
right
to
take
so
much
for
granted
said
the
marchese
allow
me
to
repair
the
negligence
of
the
marchesa
sir
he
then
pointed
out
to
the
englishman
the
direction
to
take
in
order
to
reach
the
road
leading
to
the
cliffs
a
mile
beyond
sorrento
where
the
castello
del
grippo
stood
in
the
centre
of
its
sir
percival
thanked
him
and
said
that
having
received
such
plain
directions
he
would
not
now
carry
out
his
intention
of
driving
to
the
castle
he
would
ride
there
instead
before
the
marchese
and
his
wife
took
their
departure
the
latter
had
managed
to
whisper
in
the
ear
of
sir
percival
as
she
returned
the
pressure
of
his
hand
without
till
one
of
us
dies
he
replied
how
strange
it
all
was
he
thought
that
night
as
he
stood
at
the
door
of
the
inn
where
he
was
staying
at
sorrento
and
listened
to
the
singing
of
the
fishermen
putting
out
to
sea
how
strange
it
all
was
the
seven
years
that
had
passed
since
he
had
last
heard
the
hymn
of
the
fishermen
in
that
bay
seemed
no
more
than
so
many
days
he
had
had
his
adventures
since
he
had
been
so
foolish
as
to
fancy
himself
in
love
with
paolina
poor
paolina
a
good
many
faces
had
interposed
between
the
face
of
the
italian
girl
of
and
the
face
of
the
italian
marchesa
in
but
what
a
whimsical
fate
it
was
that
had
made
him
fall
in
love
with
the
marchesa
del
grippo
more
deeply
than
he
had
ever
permitted
himself
to
fall
in
regard
to
other
women
he
had
never
known
what
it
was
to
love
before
though
she
was
the
woman
whom
he
should
have
avoided
even
if
there
were
no
other
woman
to
love
in
the
wide
world
ah
it
was
fate
the
marchesa
had
said
so
that
afternoon
at
the
villa
galeotto
she
had
loved
him
from
the
first
he
was
ready
to
swear
to
that
he
remembered
now
certain
indications
of
her
passion
which
he
had
noticed
the
first
evening
they
had
met
but
which
had
escaped
his
memory
it
was
at
lady
blessington
s
in
kensington
and
the
marchesa
had
expressed
the
pleasure
it
gave
her
to
meet
with
an
englishman
who
spoke
such
excellent
italian
he
had
been
very
cautious
at
that
time
in
replying
to
her
questions
as
to
the
length
of
time
he
had
been
in
italy
and
the
places
that
he
had
visited
it
was
not
beyond
the
bounds
of
possibility
that
after
the
lapse
of
seven
years
any
one
might
recognise
him
as
the
lover
of
paolina
so
it
was
just
as
well
he
thought
to
be
careful
he
had
not
mentioned
a
word
about
sorrento
and
not
until
the
marchesa
had
stood
by
his
side
in
the
garden
of
the
villa
galeotto
had
he
lapsed
in
his
feigning
a
complete
ignorance
of
the
locality
it
was
the
force
of
his
passion
for
that
lovely
woman
which
had
overwhelmed
him
causing
him
to
forget
himself
and
to
refer
by
name
to
various
landmarks
but
what
did
it
matter
now
the
woman
had
responded
to
him
and
in
a
day
or
two
would
be
by
his
side
for
well
for
as
long
as
he
pleased
a
short
distance
away
lord
byron
was
affording
the
italians
a
new
reading
of
the
englishman
but
sir
percival
cleave
would
take
very
good
care
that
he
was
not
made
such
a
fool
of
by
the
marchesa
as
lord
byron
was
by
the
contessa
guicciola
byron
was
practically
a
pauper
whereas
he
sir
percival
cleave
was
rich
he
could
therefore
the
logic
was
his
prevent
himself
from
ever
being
made
a
fool
of
by
any
woman
marchesa
or
contessa
though
she
might
be
but
he
loved
her
of
that
he
was
certain
he
had
asked
her
if
he
would
have
faced
the
discomforts
of
a
journey
from
england
to
italy
had
he
not
been
in
love
with
her
and
now
as
he
stood
listening
to
the
fishermen
s
hymns
sung
in
the
boats
that
were
drifting
out
of
the
bay
he
asked
himself
the
same
question
oh
yes
he
loved
her
and
her
husband
was
cruel
to
her
she
had
told
him
so
in
england
and
she
had
been
greatly
comforted
by
his
assurance
given
in
answer
to
her
inquiry
that
the
crime
of
being
cruel
to
her
was
so
great
as
to
condone
any
act
of
hers
say
running
away
with
another
man
she
was
superstitious
she
had
some
scruples
the
priests
no
doubt
were
in
the
pay
of
her
husband
and
they
had
probably
exaggerated
the
crime
of
a
wife
s
leaving
a
husband
it
would
be
so
like
a
greasy
italian
priest
to
lay
emphasis
upon
this
one
particular
act
but
he
an
english
gentleman
to
the
core
and
properly
sensible
of
the
blessings
of
a
protestant
king
and
constitution
had
succeeded
in
counteracting
the
insidious
teaching
of
the
priests
she
had
listened
to
him
she
had
readily
accepted
that
great
truth
a
woman
s
retaliation
to
her
husband
s
cruelty
is
sanctified
in
the
eyes
of
heaven
that
was
his
point
the
eyes
of
heaven
it
was
immaterial
in
what
light
such
an
act
of
retaliation
as
he
suggested
to
her
would
appear
in
the
eyes
of
the
people
of
the
world
before
he
slept
he
had
brought
himself
to
believe
that
he
was
actually
the
lady
s
honourable
champion
boldly
coming
forward
to
rescue
her
from
an
intolerable
oppressor
the
castello
del
grippo
was
built
on
the
summit
of
the
headland
that
sloped
away
from
the
sea
at
one
side
but
was
very
precipitous
on
the
other
for
three
hundred
years
the
family
of
del
grippo
had
been
accustomed
to
display
a
light
in
the
tower
nightly
for
the
guidance
of
the
for
the
castle
could
be
seen
from
the
north
as
well
as
the
south
for
more
than
a
mile
on
the
shoreward
side
of
the
castle
the
grew
mixed
with
lemons
and
oranges
and
as
sir
percival
rode
along
the
somewhat
rough
avenue
on
his
way
to
accept
the
hospitality
of
the
man
whose
wife
he
had
the
previous
day
been
instructing
on
some
interesting
points
in
regard
to
her
duty
he
was
entranced
with
the
perfumes
of
the
fruits
and
flowers
the
air
was
heavy
with
odours
of
the
citrons
and
the
gold
of
the
luscious
fruit
gleamed
among
the
glossy
leaves
though
he
had
never
been
on
the
avenue
before
the
gleam
of
the
fruit
and
the
exquisite
scents
brought
back
to
him
the
sweet
memory
of
paolina
it
was
not
at
this
side
of
the
great
garden
that
he
had
been
accustomed
to
meet
her
but
on
the
other
side
that
nearest
the
cliff
a
mile
away
it
was
a
sweet
sad
memory
and
it
was
so
poignant
that
it
even
caused
him
to
sigh
and
murmur
ah
la
povera
paolina
la
povera
paolina
and
having
thereby
satisfied
himself
that
his
heart
was
as
soft
as
the
heart
of
a
little
child
he
urged
his
horse
forward
he
soon
reached
the
castle
and
it
seemed
gloomy
enough
outlined
against
the
wonderful
blue
sky
he
had
seen
numbers
of
the
peasants
working
among
the
olives
but
close
to
the
castle
none
were
in
sight
it
was
not
until
he
had
dismounted
and
pulled
the
handle
of
the
old
iron
bell
that
a
servant
appeared
in
a
few
moments
the
marchese
himself
came
out
of
a
room
at
one
side
of
the
hall
and
welcomed
his
guest
giving
instructions
to
another
servant
to
stable
the
horse
you
have
not
met
the
marchesa
he
inquired
of
sir
percival
she
left
the
castle
ago
trusting
to
meet
you
pray
enter
and
we
shall
have
some
but
sir
percival
declined
to
enter
in
the
absence
of
the
marchesa
he
felt
that
to
do
so
would
be
very
gross
to
say
the
least
of
it
the
idea
of
sitting
down
with
the
marchese
while
the
lady
his
lady
was
wandering
disconsolately
around
the
grounds
in
search
of
him
was
very
repugnant
to
him
as
you
will
said
the
marchese
with
a
shrug
when
he
remarked
that
he
would
like
to
go
in
search
of
the
marchesa
as
you
will
she
is
not
likely
to
get
lost
oh
yes
we
shall
go
in
search
of
her
and
that
will
serve
me
as
an
excuse
for
showing
you
some
of
the
spots
to
which
interest
attaches
within
our
he
picked
up
a
hat
and
stick
and
left
the
castle
with
his
visitor
we
shall
first
go
to
the
grove
where
the
historic
duel
was
fought
between
my
ancestor
and
the
two
nephews
of
pope
adrian
said
the
marchese
you
have
heard
of
that
affair
no
shall
we
be
likely
to
find
the
marchesa
there
asked
sir
percival
as
likely
as
not
we
shall
meet
her
as
we
go
there
replied
the
marchese
he
led
the
way
through
an
avenue
of
ilex
and
they
soon
came
upon
a
cleared
space
at
the
foot
of
a
terrace
of
rocks
the
marchese
explained
the
position
occupied
by
the
combatants
in
the
famous
duel
that
had
so
consolidated
the
position
of
the
family
of
del
grippo
but
all
the
time
the
details
of
the
incident
were
being
explained
to
him
sir
percival
was
casting
his
eyes
around
for
the
appearance
of
the
lady
what
did
he
care
about
pope
adrian
or
his
nephews
so
long
as
his
lady
he
had
come
to
think
of
her
as
his
lady
was
roaming
the
grounds
in
search
of
him
then
his
host
brought
him
to
where
the
body
of
his
grandfather
had
been
found
by
the
side
of
the
three
men
whom
he
had
killed
before
receiving
the
fatal
blow
from
behind
dealt
by
that
poltroon
prince
roberto
who
had
hired
four
of
his
bravos
to
attack
the
old
man
at
another
part
of
the
grounds
were
the
ruins
of
the
ancient
where
a
certain
member
of
this
distinguished
family
had
strangled
his
wife
whom
he
had
suspected
of
infidelity
though
as
the
marchese
explained
the
lady
had
saved
him
more
than
once
from
assassination
and
was
perfectly
guiltless
an
hour
had
been
passed
viewing
these
very
interesting
localities
about
which
the
air
of
the
middle
ages
still
lingered
and
still
the
marchesa
was
absent
should
we
not
return
to
the
castle
the
marchesa
may
be
waiting
for
us
suggested
sir
percival
a
thousand
pardons
cried
the
marchese
i
fear
i
have
fatigued
you
you
are
well
yes
i
am
somewhat
thirsty
laughed
the
visitor
how
discourteous
i
have
been
we
shall
have
the
refreshment
of
an
orange
before
returning
there
is
a
famous
grove
a
short
way
toward
the
he
strode
onward
and
then
suddenly
turning
down
a
narrow
path
made
among
the
olives
sir
percival
gave
a
start
for
he
found
himself
by
the
side
of
the
marchese
at
the
one
part
of
those
grounds
with
which
he
was
well
acquainted
they
stood
among
the
at
the
summit
of
the
cliff
which
he
had
nightly
climbed
to
meet
paolina
here
are
our
choicest
fruits
said
the
marchese
plucking
an
orange
and
handing
it
to
his
visitor
break
it
open
and
you
will
see
how
exquisite
the
fruit
sir
percival
broke
the
orange
but
the
moment
he
did
so
it
fell
from
his
fingers
and
he
gave
a
cry
of
horror
for
out
of
the
fruit
had
come
a
red
stream
staining
his
hands
the
marchese
laughed
loud
and
long
your
hands
are
embrued
with
blood
he
said
oh
a
stranger
might
fancy
for
a
moment
that
sir
percival
cleave
was
a
murderer
ah
pray
pardon
my
folly
that
is
only
the
refreshing
juice
of
the
orange
and
yet
you
fancied
that
it
was
blood
come
my
friend
take
courage
here
is
another
eat
it
you
will
find
it
delicious
i
have
heard
that
there
are
in
the
world
such
strange
monsters
as
are
refreshed
by
drinking
blood
we
have
ourselves
vampires
in
this
neighbourhood
but
you
and
i
sir
we
prefer
only
the
heart
s
blood
of
a
simple
orange
you
will
eat
i
could
not
touch
one
said
sir
percival
nay
to
do
me
the
favour
what
an
englishman
and
superstitious
sir
percival
took
another
orange
and
made
a
pretence
of
eating
it
his
hands
trembled
so
however
they
were
soon
dripping
with
the
crimson
juice
you
are
caught
in
the
act
said
the
marchese
but
the
man
who
came
here
long
ago
was
not
so
another
medieval
story
said
sir
percival
had
your
excellency
not
better
reserve
it
for
the
evening
this
story
is
not
a
medieval
one
and
it
can
only
be
told
on
the
spot
said
the
marchese
you
have
never
been
here
before
or
you
would
not
need
to
be
told
that
this
was
until
seven
years
ago
an
ordinary
one
it
was
not
until
blood
was
spilt
here
seven
years
ago
that
the
fruit
became
crimson
when
bruised
and
blood
your
hands
are
dyed
with
it
flowed
from
it
as
you
have
seen
it
is
on
your
lips
you
have
drunk
of
her
blood
paolina
for
gods
sake
let
us
leave
this
place
said
sir
percival
hoarsely
i
have
heard
enough
stories
of
nay
this
one
is
so
piteous
you
shall
hear
it
and
weep
sir
ah
tears
of
blood
might
be
drawn
from
the
most
at
the
story
of
paolina
she
was
a
sweet
girl
she
lived
with
her
sister
who
is
now
the
marchesa
good
god
what
amazes
you
sir
is
it
remarkable
that
my
wife
should
have
had
a
sister
no
no
of
course
not
i
was
only
surprised
to
find
those
horrid
marks
still
on
my
hands
pray
let
us
return
to
the
castle
and
permit
me
to
remove
the
poor
paolina
she
lived
at
the
castle
with
our
aunt
seven
years
ago
she
was
a
flower
of
girlhood
i
thought
myself
in
love
with
her
but
when
my
brother
ugo
he
was
the
elder
confided
in
me
that
he
loved
her
i
left
the
castle
he
loved
her
and
it
seemed
that
she
returned
his
affection
they
were
betrothed
and
one
could
not
doubt
that
their
happiness
was
assured
but
one
evil
day
she
met
a
man
a
scoundrel
i
regret
to
say
that
he
was
an
englishman
do
not
move
sir
you
shall
hear
me
out
this
villain
spoke
to
her
of
love
he
tempted
her
she
was
accustomed
to
meet
him
every
evening
on
this
very
spot
we
learned
that
he
sailed
from
sorrento
and
climbed
the
cliff
my
brother
began
to
suspect
he
followed
her
here
one
evening
and
she
confessed
everything
to
him
he
was
a
passionate
man
and
he
strangled
her
here
here
and
then
flung
himself
headlong
from
the
a
gruesome
story
marchese
now
shall
we
return
villain
assassin
look
at
your
hands
they
are
wet
with
her
blood
your
lips
they
have
drunk
her
blood
but
tis
their
last
draught
for
sir
percival
sprang
at
the
man
and
caught
him
by
the
throat
but
in
an
instant
his
hands
relaxed
he
had
only
strength
to
glance
round
he
saw
the
woman
who
had
stabbed
him
before
he
fell
forward
that
one
was
for
her
for
her
my
beloved
sister
this
one
is
for
our
dear
brother
the
man
whom
you
wronged
this
she
stabbed
him
again
his
blood
mixed
with
the
crimson
stains
on
the
earth
look
at
it
bear
witness
that
i
have
kept
my
oath
cried
the
marchesa
did
not
i
swear
that
his
blood
should
be
drunk
by
the
same
earth
that
drank
hers
beloved
one
you
are
an
angel
an
avenging
angel
cried
the
marchese
embracing
his
wife
the
next
day
sir
percival
cleave
s
horse
was
found
dead
at
the
foot
of
one
of
the
cliffs
but
the
body
of
the
unfortunate
baronet
so
he
was
termed
by
the
newspapers
english
was
never
recovered
the
strange
story
of
northavon
priory
when
arthur
jephson
wrote
to
me
to
join
his
christmas
party
at
northavon
priory
i
was
set
wondering
where
i
had
heard
the
name
of
this
particular
establishment
i
felt
certain
that
i
had
heard
the
name
before
but
i
could
not
recollect
for
the
moment
whether
i
had
come
upon
it
in
a
newspaper
report
of
a
breach
of
promise
of
marriage
or
in
a
bearing
upon
inland
fisheries
i
rather
inclined
to
the
belief
that
it
was
in
a
of
some
sort
i
had
been
devoting
myself
some
years
previously
to
an
exhaustive
study
of
this
form
of
literature
for
being
very
young
i
had
had
a
notion
that
a
education
was
essential
to
any
one
with
parliamentary
aspirations
yes
i
had
i
repeat
been
very
young
at
that
time
and
i
had
not
found
out
that
a
is
the
of
inconvenient
facts
it
was
not
until
i
had
promised
arthur
to
be
with
him
on
christmas
eve
that
i
recollected
where
i
had
read
something
about
northavon
priory
and
in
a
moment
i
understood
how
it
was
i
had
acquired
the
notion
that
the
name
had
appeared
in
an
official
document
i
had
read
a
good
deal
about
this
priory
in
a
curious
manuscript
which
i
had
unearthed
at
sir
dennis
le
warden
s
place
in
norfolk
known
as
marsh
towers
the
document
which
with
many
others
i
found
stowed
away
in
a
in
the
great
library
purported
to
be
a
draft
of
the
evidence
taken
before
one
of
the
commissions
appointed
by
king
henry
viii
to
inquire
into
the
abuses
alleged
to
be
associated
with
certain
religious
houses
throughout
england
an
ancestor
of
sir
dennis
s
had
it
appeared
been
a
member
of
one
of
these
commissions
and
he
had
taken
a
note
of
the
evidence
which
he
had
in
the
course
of
his
duties
handed
to
the
king
the
parchments
had
i
learned
been
preserved
in
an
iron
coffer
with
double
padlocks
but
the
keys
had
been
lost
at
some
remote
period
and
then
the
coffer
had
been
covered
over
with
lumber
in
a
room
in
the
east
tower
overlooking
the
moat
until
an
outbreak
of
fire
had
resulted
in
an
overturning
of
the
rubbish
and
a
discovery
of
the
coffer
a
blacksmith
had
been
employed
to
pick
the
locks
which
he
did
with
a
but
it
was
generally
admitted
that
his
energy
had
been
wasted
when
the
contents
of
the
box
were
made
known
sir
dennis
cared
about
nothing
except
the
improvement
of
the
breed
of
horses
through
the
agency
of
race
meetings
so
the
manuscripts
of
his
painstaking
ancestor
were
bundled
into
one
of
the
presses
in
the
library
some
however
being
reserved
by
the
intelligent
housekeeper
in
the
to
make
covers
a
purpose
for
which
as
she
explained
to
me
at
considerable
length
they
were
extremely
well
adapted
i
had
no
great
difficulty
in
deciphering
those
that
came
under
my
hand
for
i
had
had
considerable
experience
of
the
tricks
of
early
english
writers
and
as
i
read
i
became
greatly
interested
in
all
the
original
trustie
and
d
sir
denice
le
warden
had
written
the
frankness
of
the
evidence
which
he
had
collected
on
certain
points
took
away
my
breath
although
i
had
been
long
accustomed
to
the
directness
with
which
some
of
the
people
expressed
themselves
northavon
priory
was
among
the
religious
houses
whose
practices
had
formed
the
subject
of
the
inquiry
and
it
was
the
summary
of
sir
denice
s
notes
regarding
the
black
masses
alleged
to
have
been
celebrated
within
its
walls
that
proved
so
absorbing
to
me
the
bald
account
of
the
nature
of
these
orgies
would
of
itself
have
been
sufficient
if
substantiated
to
bring
about
the
dissolution
of
all
the
order
in
england
the
black
mass
was
a
pagan
revel
the
details
of
which
were
unspeakable
though
their
nature
was
more
than
hinted
at
by
the
king
s
commissioner
anything
so
monstrously
blasphemous
could
not
be
imagined
by
the
mind
of
man
for
with
the
pagan
orgie
there
was
mixed
up
the
most
solemn
rite
of
the
mass
it
was
celebrated
on
the
night
of
christmas
eve
and
at
the
hour
of
midnight
the
celebration
culminated
in
an
invocation
to
the
devil
written
so
as
to
parody
an
office
of
the
church
and
according
to
the
accounts
of
some
witnesses
in
a
human
sacrifice
upon
this
latter
point
however
sir
denice
admitted
there
was
a
diversity
of
opinion
one
of
the
witnesses
examined
was
a
man
who
had
entered
the
priory
grounds
from
the
river
during
a
fearful
tempest
on
one
christmas
eve
and
had
he
said
witnessed
the
revel
through
a
window
to
which
he
had
climbed
he
declared
that
at
the
hour
of
midnight
the
candles
had
been
extinguished
but
that
a
moment
afterwards
an
awful
red
light
had
floated
through
the
room
followed
by
the
shrieks
of
a
human
being
at
the
point
of
strangulation
and
then
by
horrible
yells
of
laughter
another
man
who
was
examined
had
been
a
in
the
service
of
the
priory
and
he
had
upon
one
occasion
witnessed
the
celebration
of
a
black
mass
but
he
averred
that
no
life
was
sacrificed
though
he
admitted
that
in
the
strange
red
light
which
had
flashed
through
the
room
he
had
seen
what
appeared
to
be
two
men
struggling
on
the
floor
in
the
general
particulars
of
the
orgie
there
was
however
no
diversity
of
opinion
and
had
the
old
sir
denice
le
warden
been
anything
of
a
comparative
mythologist
he
could
scarcely
fail
to
have
been
greatly
interested
in
being
brought
face
to
face
with
so
striking
an
example
of
the
survival
of
an
ancient
superstition
within
the
walls
of
a
holy
building
during
a
rainy
week
i
amused
myself
among
the
parchments
dealing
with
northavon
priory
and
although
what
i
read
impressed
me
greatly
at
the
time
yet
three
years
of
pretty
hard
work
in
various
parts
of
the
world
had
so
dulled
my
memory
of
any
incident
so
unimportant
as
the
deciphering
of
a
mouldy
document
that
as
i
have
already
stated
it
was
not
until
i
had
posted
my
letter
to
arthur
jephson
agreeing
to
spend
a
day
or
two
with
his
party
that
i
succeeded
in
recalling
something
of
what
i
had
read
regarding
northavon
priory
i
had
taken
it
for
granted
that
the
priory
had
been
demolished
when
henry
had
superintended
the
dissolution
of
the
religious
establishments
throughout
the
country
i
did
not
think
it
likely
that
one
with
such
a
record
as
was
embodied
in
the
notes
would
be
allowed
to
remain
with
a
single
stone
on
another
a
moment
s
additional
reflection
admitted
of
my
perceiving
how
extremely
unlikely
it
was
that
even
if
northavon
priory
had
been
spared
by
the
king
it
would
still
be
available
for
visitors
during
the
latter
years
of
the
nineteenth
century
i
had
seen
many
abbeys
and
priories
in
various
parts
of
the
country
not
more
than
ten
years
old
inhabited
mostly
by
gentlemen
who
had
made
fortunes
in
iron
or
perhaps
lard
which
constitutes
i
understand
an
excellent
foundation
for
a
fortune
there
might
be
for
all
i
knew
a
score
of
northavon
priories
in
england
arthur
jephson
s
father
had
made
his
money
by
the
judicious
advertising
of
a
certain
oriental
rug
manufactured
in
the
midlands
and
i
thought
it
very
likely
that
he
had
built
a
mansion
for
himself
which
he
had
called
northavon
priory
a
letter
which
i
received
from
arthur
set
my
mind
at
rest
he
explained
to
me
very
fully
that
northavon
priory
was
a
hotel
built
within
the
walls
of
an
ancient
religious
house
he
had
spent
a
delightful
month
fishing
in
the
river
during
the
summer
i
had
been
fishing
in
the
amazon
at
that
time
and
had
sojourned
at
the
hotel
which
he
had
found
to
be
a
marvel
of
comfort
in
spite
of
its
picturesqueness
this
was
why
he
said
he
had
thought
how
jolly
it
would
be
to
entertain
a
party
of
his
friends
at
the
place
during
the
christmas
week
that
explanation
was
quite
good
enough
for
me
i
had
a
week
or
two
to
myself
in
england
before
going
to
india
and
so
soon
as
i
recalled
what
i
had
read
regarding
priory
i
felt
glad
that
my
liking
for
jephson
had
induced
me
to
accept
his
invitation
it
was
not
until
we
were
travelling
together
to
the
station
nearest
to
the
priory
that
he
mentioned
to
me
quite
incidentally
that
during
the
summer
he
had
been
fortunate
enough
to
make
the
acquaintance
of
a
young
woman
who
resided
in
a
spacious
mansion
within
easy
distance
of
the
priory
hotel
and
who
was
so
far
as
he
was
capable
of
judging
and
he
considered
that
in
such
matters
his
judgment
was
worth
something
the
most
charming
girl
in
england
i
see
i
remarked
before
his
preliminary
panegyric
had
quite
come
to
a
legitimate
conclusion
i
see
all
now
you
haven
t
the
courage
to
be
more
exact
the
impudence
to
come
down
alone
to
the
hotel
she
has
probably
a
brother
who
is
a
bit
of
an
athlete
but
you
think
that
tom
singleton
and
i
will
form
a
good
enough
excuse
for
an
act
on
your
part
which
parents
and
guardians
can
construe
in
one
way
well
perhaps
hang
it
all
man
you
needn
t
attribute
to
me
any
motives
but
those
of
the
purest
hospitality
laughed
my
companion
isn
t
the
prospect
of
a
genuine
old
english
christmas
the
yule
log
and
that
sort
of
thing
good
enough
for
you
without
going
any
further
it
s
quite
good
enough
for
me
i
replied
i
only
regret
that
it
is
not
good
enough
for
you
you
expect
to
see
her
every
day
every
day
don
t
be
a
fool
jim
if
i
see
her
more
than
four
times
in
the
course
of
the
week
i
think
i
should
manage
to
see
her
four
times
i
will
consider
myself
exceptionally
and
if
you
see
her
less
than
four
times
you
will
reckon
yourself
uncommonly
unlucky
o
i
think
i
have
arranged
for
four
times
all
right
i
ll
have
to
trust
to
luck
for
the
what
you
mean
to
say
that
the
business
has
gone
as
far
as
that
as
what
as
making
arrangements
for
meetings
with
her
my
friend
laughed
complacently
well
you
see
old
chap
i
couldn
t
very
well
give
you
this
treat
without
letting
her
know
that
i
should
be
in
the
neighbourhood
said
he
oh
indeed
i
don
t
see
however
what
the
great
heavens
you
mean
to
say
that
you
don
t
see
oh
you
will
have
your
i
hope
i
will
have
one
eventually
i
can
t
say
that
i
perceive
much
chance
of
one
at
present
however
you
ll
not
give
us
much
of
your
interesting
society
during
the
week
of
our
treat
as
you
call
i
ll
give
you
as
much
of
it
as
i
can
spare
more
than
you
ll
be
likely
to
relish
perhaps
a
week
s
a
long
time
time
travels
at
divers
paces
with
divers
persons
my
friend
i
suppose
she
s
as
lovely
as
any
of
the
others
of
past
years
as
lovely
jim
she
s
just
the
don
t
trouble
yourself
over
the
description
i
have
a
vivid
recollection
of
the
phrases
you
employed
in
regard
to
the
others
there
was
lily
and
gwen
and
bee
and
yes
by
george
there
was
a
fourth
her
name
was
nelly
or
all
flashes
in
the
pan
my
friend
i
didn
t
know
my
own
mind
in
those
old
days
but
now
thank
heaven
oh
you
ll
agree
with
me
when
you
see
her
this
is
the
real
thing
and
no
he
was
good
enough
to
give
me
a
genuine
lover
s
description
of
the
young
woman
whose
name
was
he
said
sylvia
st
leger
but
it
did
not
differ
materially
from
the
descriptions
which
had
come
from
him
in
past
days
of
certainly
four
other
girls
for
whom
he
had
he
imagined
entertained
a
devotion
strong
as
death
itself
alas
his
devotion
had
not
survived
a
single
year
in
any
case
when
we
arrived
at
the
hotel
after
a
drive
of
eight
miles
from
the
railway
station
we
found
tom
singleton
waiting
for
us
rather
impatiently
and
in
a
quarter
of
an
hour
we
were
facing
an
excellent
dinner
we
were
the
only
guests
at
the
hotel
for
though
it
was
picturesquely
situated
on
the
high
bank
of
the
river
and
was
doubtless
a
delightful
place
for
a
sojourn
in
summer
yet
in
winter
it
possessed
few
attractions
to
casual
visitors
after
dinner
i
strolled
over
the
house
and
found
to
my
surprise
that
the
old
walls
of
the
priory
were
practically
intact
the
kitchen
was
also
unchanged
but
the
great
refectory
was
now
divided
into
four
rooms
the
apartments
upstairs
had
plainly
been
divided
in
the
same
way
by
brick
partitions
but
the
outer
walls
pierced
with
narrow
windows
were
those
of
the
original
priory
in
the
morning
i
made
further
explorations
only
outside
the
building
and
came
upon
the
ruins
of
the
old
priory
tower
and
then
i
perceived
that
only
a
small
portion
of
the
original
building
had
been
utilised
for
the
hotel
the
landlord
who
accompanied
me
was
certainly
no
antiquarian
he
told
me
that
he
had
been
let
in
so
far
as
the
hotel
was
concerned
he
had
been
given
to
understand
that
the
receipts
for
the
summer
months
were
sufficiently
great
to
compensate
for
the
absence
of
visitors
during
the
winter
but
his
experience
of
one
year
had
not
confirmed
this
statement
made
by
the
people
from
whom
he
had
bought
the
place
and
he
had
come
to
the
conclusion
that
as
he
had
been
taken
in
in
the
transaction
it
was
his
duty
to
try
to
take
in
some
one
else
in
the
same
way
i
only
hope
that
i
may
succeed
sir
he
said
but
i
m
doubtful
about
it
people
are
getting
more
suspicious
every
you
weren
t
suspicious
at
any
rate
said
i
that
i
weren
t
more
s
the
pity
sir
said
he
but
it
ll
take
me
all
my
time
to
get
the
place
off
my
hands
i
know
ah
yes
it
s
hard
to
get
people
to
take
your
word
for
anything
for
the
next
two
days
tom
singleton
and
i
were
left
a
good
deal
together
the
fact
being
that
our
friend
arthur
parted
from
us
after
lunch
and
only
returned
in
time
for
dinner
declaring
upon
each
occasion
that
he
had
just
passed
the
pleasantest
day
of
his
life
on
christmas
eve
he
came
to
us
in
high
spirits
bearing
with
him
an
invitation
from
a
lady
who
had
attained
distinction
through
being
the
mother
of
miss
st
leger
for
us
to
spend
christmas
day
at
her
house
it
had
already
been
pointed
out
to
us
by
arthur
it
was
a
fine
georgian
country
house
named
the
grange
i
ve
accepted
for
you
both
said
arthur
mrs
st
leger
is
a
most
charming
woman
and
her
daughter
i
don
t
know
if
i
mentioned
that
she
had
a
daughter
well
if
i
omitted
i
am
now
in
a
position
to
assure
you
that
her
daughter
her
name
is
sylvia
is
possibly
the
most
beautiful
but
there
s
no
use
trying
to
describe
her
you
ll
see
her
for
yourselves
and
judge
if
i
ve
exaggerated
in
the
least
when
i
say
that
the
world
does
not
contain
a
more
exquisite
yes
one
hour
with
her
will
be
quite
sufficient
to
enable
us
to
pronounce
an
opinion
on
that
point
laughed
tom
we
remained
smoking
in
front
of
the
log
fire
that
blazed
in
the
great
hearth
until
about
eleven
o
clock
and
then
went
to
our
rooms
upstairs
after
some
in
the
hall
my
room
was
a
small
one
at
the
beginning
of
the
corridor
arthur
jephson
s
was
alongside
it
and
at
the
very
end
of
the
corridor
was
tom
singleton
s
all
had
at
one
time
been
one
apartment
having
walked
a
good
deal
during
the
day
i
was
very
tired
and
had
scarcely
got
into
bed
before
i
fell
asleep
when
i
awoke
it
was
with
a
start
and
a
consciousness
that
something
was
burning
a
curious
red
light
streamed
into
the
room
from
outside
i
sprang
from
my
bed
in
a
moment
and
ran
to
the
window
but
before
i
had
reached
it
the
room
was
in
darkness
once
more
and
there
came
a
yell
of
laughter
apparently
from
the
next
room
for
a
moment
i
was
paralysed
but
the
next
instant
i
had
recovered
my
presence
of
mind
i
believed
that
arthur
and
tom
had
been
playing
some
of
their
tricks
upon
me
they
had
burnt
a
red
light
outside
my
window
and
were
roaring
with
laughter
as
they
heard
me
spring
out
of
bed
that
was
the
explanation
of
what
i
had
seen
and
heard
which
first
suggested
itself
to
me
and
i
was
about
to
return
to
bed
when
my
door
was
knocked
at
and
then
opened
what
on
earth
have
you
been
up
to
came
the
voice
of
arthur
jephson
have
you
set
the
on
fire
if
you
have
that
s
nothing
to
laugh
get
out
of
this
room
with
your
larking
said
i
it
s
a
very
poor
joke
that
of
yours
arthur
go
back
to
your
he
struck
a
light
he
had
a
in
his
hand
and
went
to
my
candle
without
a
word
in
a
moment
the
room
was
faintly
illuminated
do
you
mean
to
say
that
you
hadn
t
a
light
here
just
now
a
red
light
he
cried
i
had
no
light
a
red
light
floated
through
the
room
but
it
seemed
to
come
from
outside
said
i
and
who
was
it
laughed
in
that
wild
way
i
took
it
for
granted
that
it
was
you
and
tom
who
were
about
your
usual
larks
no
i
was
about
no
larks
i
can
promise
you
good
lord
man
that
laugh
was
something
beyond
a
he
seated
himself
on
my
bed
do
you
fancy
it
may
have
been
some
of
the
servants
going
about
the
stables
with
a
he
continued
there
may
have
been
a
late
arrival
at
the
hotel
you
that
s
not
at
all
unlikely
said
i
yes
it
may
have
been
that
and
the
laughter
may
have
been
between
the
i
don
t
hear
any
sound
of
bustle
through
the
house
or
outside
said
he
the
stables
are
not
at
this
angle
of
the
building
said
i
we
must
merely
have
seen
the
light
and
heard
that
laughter
as
the
carriage
passed
our
angle
anyhow
we
ll
only
catch
cold
if
we
lounge
about
in
our
pyjamas
like
this
you
d
best
get
back
to
bed
and
let
me
do
the
i
don
t
feel
much
inclined
to
sleep
but
i
ll
not
prevent
your
having
your
night
s
rest
said
he
rising
i
wonder
is
it
near
morning
i
held
the
candle
before
the
dial
of
my
watch
that
hung
above
my
bed
it
s
exactly
five
minutes
past
twelve
said
i
we
ve
slept
barely
an
then
the
sooner
i
clear
out
the
better
it
will
be
for
both
of
us
said
he
he
went
away
slowly
and
i
heard
him
strike
a
match
in
his
own
room
he
evidently
meant
to
light
his
candle
some
hours
had
passed
before
i
fell
into
an
uneasy
sleep
and
once
more
i
was
awakened
by
arthur
jephson
who
stood
by
my
bedside
the
morning
light
was
in
the
room
for
god
s
sake
come
into
tom
s
room
he
whispered
he
s
dead
tom
is
dead
i
tried
to
realise
his
words
some
moments
had
elapsed
before
i
succeeded
in
doing
so
i
sprang
from
my
bed
and
ran
down
the
corridor
to
the
room
occupied
by
tom
singleton
the
landlord
and
a
couple
of
servants
were
already
there
they
had
burst
in
the
door
it
was
but
too
true
our
poor
friend
lay
on
his
bed
with
his
body
bent
and
his
arms
twisted
as
though
he
had
been
struggling
desperately
with
some
one
at
his
last
moment
his
face
too
was
horribly
contorted
and
his
eyes
were
wide
open
a
doctor
i
managed
to
say
he
s
already
sent
for
sir
said
the
landlord
in
a
few
moments
the
doctor
arrived
cardiac
attack
said
he
was
he
alone
in
the
room
no
he
can
t
have
been
he
was
quite
alone
said
arthur
i
knocked
at
the
door
a
quarter
of
an
hour
ago
but
getting
no
answer
i
tried
to
force
the
lock
it
was
too
strong
for
me
but
the
landlord
and
the
who
was
bringing
us
our
hot
water
burst
in
the
door
at
my
and
the
window
was
it
fastened
asked
the
doctor
it
was
secure
sir
said
the
landlord
ah
a
sudden
cardiac
attack
said
the
doctor
there
was
of
course
an
inquest
but
as
no
evidence
of
foul
play
was
forthcoming
the
doctor
s
phrase
cardiac
attack
satisfied
the
jury
and
a
verdict
of
death
from
natural
causes
was
returned
before
i
went
back
to
town
i
examined
the
room
in
which
our
poor
friend
had
died
on
the
side
of
one
of
the
there
were
four
curious
burnt
marks
they
gave
one
the
impression
that
the
shutter
had
at
one
time
been
grasped
by
a
man
wearing
a
gauntlet
i
started
for
india
before
the
end
of
the
year
and
remained
there
for
eight
months
then
i
thought
i
would
pay
a
visit
to
a
sister
of
mine
in
queensland
on
my
return
at
the
end
of
the
year
i
meant
to
stop
at
cairo
for
a
few
weeks
on
entering
shepheard
s
hotel
i
found
myself
face
to
face
with
arthur
jephson
and
his
wife
he
called
her
sylvia
they
had
been
married
in
august
but
their
honeymoon
seemed
still
to
be
in
its
first
quarter
it
was
after
mrs
jephson
had
retired
and
when
arthur
was
sitting
with
me
enjoying
the
cool
of
the
night
by
the
aid
of
a
pretty
strong
cigar
or
two
that
we
ventured
to
allude
to
the
tragic
occurrence
which
marked
our
last
time
of
meeting
i
wish
to
beg
of
you
not
to
make
any
allusion
to
that
awful
business
in
the
hearing
of
my
wife
said
arthur
in
fact
i
must
ask
you
not
to
allude
to
that
fearful
room
in
the
priory
in
any
i
will
be
careful
not
to
do
so
said
i
you
have
your
own
reasons
i
suppose
for
giving
me
this
i
have
the
best
of
reasons
jim
she
too
had
her
experience
of
that
room
and
it
was
as
terrible
as
good
heavens
i
heard
nothing
of
that
she
did
not
sleep
in
that
room
thank
god
she
didn
t
i
arrived
in
time
to
save
i
need
scarcely
say
that
my
interest
was
now
fully
aroused
tell
me
what
happened
if
you
dare
tell
it
i
said
you
were
abroad
and
so
you
wouldn
t
be
likely
to
hear
of
the
fire
at
the
grange
said
my
friend
after
a
pause
i
heard
nothing
of
it
took
place
only
two
days
before
last
christmas
i
had
been
in
the
south
of
france
where
i
had
spent
a
month
or
two
with
my
mother
she
can
not
stand
a
winter
at
home
and
i
had
promised
sylvia
to
return
to
the
grange
for
christmas
when
i
got
to
northavon
i
found
her
and
her
mother
and
their
servants
at
the
priory
hotel
the
fire
had
taken
place
the
previous
night
and
they
found
the
hotel
very
handy
when
they
hadn
t
a
roof
of
their
own
over
their
heads
well
we
dined
together
and
were
as
jolly
as
was
possible
under
the
circumstances
until
bedtime
i
had
actually
said
good
night
to
sylvia
before
i
recollected
what
had
taken
place
the
previous
christmas
eve
in
the
same
house
i
rushed
upstairs
and
found
sylvia
in
the
act
of
entering
the
room
that
fatal
room
when
i
implored
of
her
to
choose
some
other
apartment
she
only
laughed
at
first
and
assured
me
that
she
wasn
t
superstitious
but
when
she
saw
that
i
was
serious
i
was
deadly
serious
as
you
can
believe
jim
i
can
i
well
she
agreed
to
sleep
in
her
mother
s
room
and
i
went
away
relieved
so
soon
as
i
returned
to
the
fire
in
the
i
began
to
think
of
poor
tom
singleton
i
felt
curiously
excited
and
i
knew
that
it
would
be
useless
for
me
to
go
to
bed
in
fact
i
made
up
my
mind
not
to
leave
the
for
some
hours
at
any
rate
and
when
the
landlord
came
to
turn
out
the
lights
i
told
him
he
might
trust
me
to
do
that
duty
for
him
he
left
me
alone
in
the
room
about
eleven
o
clock
when
the
sound
of
his
feet
upon
the
oaken
stairs
died
away
i
felt
as
fearful
as
a
child
in
the
dark
i
lit
another
cigar
and
walked
about
the
room
for
some
time
i
went
to
the
window
that
opened
upon
the
old
priory
ground
and
seeing
that
the
night
was
a
fine
one
i
opened
the
door
and
strolled
out
hoping
that
the
cool
air
would
do
me
good
i
had
not
gone
many
yards
across
the
little
patch
of
green
before
i
turned
and
looked
up
at
the
house
at
the
last
window
the
window
of
that
room
a
fire
had
been
lighted
in
the
room
early
in
the
evening
and
its
glow
shone
through
the
white
blind
suddenly
that
faint
glow
increased
to
a
terrific
glare
a
red
glare
jim
and
then
there
came
before
my
eyes
for
a
moment
the
shadow
of
two
figures
upon
the
blind
one
the
figure
of
a
woman
the
other
god
knows
what
it
was
i
rushed
back
to
the
room
but
before
i
had
reached
the
door
i
heard
the
horrible
laughter
once
again
it
seemed
to
come
from
that
room
and
to
pass
on
through
the
air
into
the
distance
across
the
river
i
ran
upstairs
with
a
light
and
found
sylvia
and
her
mother
standing
together
with
wraps
around
them
at
the
door
of
the
room
thank
god
you
are
safe
i
managed
to
cry
i
feared
that
you
had
returned
to
the
you
heard
it
that
awful
laughter
she
whispered
you
heard
it
and
you
saw
something
what
was
it
i
gently
forced
her
and
her
mother
back
to
their
room
for
the
servants
and
the
landlord
s
family
were
now
crowding
into
the
corridor
they
too
had
heard
enough
to
alarm
you
went
to
the
room
the
scene
of
that
dreadful
morning
was
repeated
the
door
was
locked
on
the
inside
we
broke
it
in
and
found
a
girl
lying
dead
on
the
floor
her
face
contorted
just
as
poor
singleton
s
was
she
was
sylvia
s
maid
and
it
was
thought
that
on
hearing
that
her
mistress
was
not
going
to
occupy
the
room
she
had
gone
into
it
herself
on
account
of
the
fire
which
had
been
lighted
and
the
doctor
said
cardiac
attack
the
same
as
before
singular
coincidence
i
need
scarcely
say
that
we
never
slept
again
under
that
accursed
roof
poor
sylvia
she
was
overwhelmed
at
the
thought
of
how
narrow
her
escape
had
did
you
notice
anything
remarkable
about
the
room
about
the
shutters
of
the
window
i
asked
he
looked
at
me
curiously
for
a
moment
then
he
bent
forward
and
said
on
the
edge
of
the
shutter
there
were
some
curious
marks
where
the
wood
had
been
as
if
a
hand
with
a
gauntlet
had
been
laid
upon
it
there
were
the
marks
of
two
such
hands
said
my
friend
slowly
we
remained
for
an
hour
in
the
garden
then
we
threw
away
the
ends
of
our
cigars
and
went
into
the
hotel
without
another
word
