introduction
in
this
ghost
book
larigot
himself
a
writer
of
supernatural
tales
has
collected
a
remarkable
batch
of
documents
fictive
or
real
describing
the
one
human
experience
that
is
hardest
to
make
good
perhaps
the
very
difficulty
of
it
has
rendered
it
more
tempting
to
the
writers
who
have
dealt
with
the
subject
his
collection
notably
varied
and
artfully
chosen
as
it
is
yet
by
no
means
exhausts
the
literature
which
fills
a
place
apart
with
its
own
recognised
classics
magic
masters
and
dealers
in
the
occult
their
testimony
serves
to
show
that
the
forms
by
which
men
and
women
are
haunted
are
far
more
diverse
and
subtle
than
we
knew
so
much
so
that
one
begins
to
wonder
at
last
if
every
person
is
not
liable
to
be
possessed
for
lurking
under
the
seeming
identity
of
these
visitations
the
dramatic
differences
of
their
entrances
and
appearances
night
and
day
are
so
marked
as
to
suggest
that
the
experience
is
given
the
fit
temperament
and
occasion
inevitable
one
would
even
be
disposed
accepting
this
idea
to
bring
into
the
account
as
valid
stories
and
pieces
of
literature
not
usually
accounted
part
of
the
ghostly
canon
there
are
the
novels
and
tales
whose
argument
is
the
tragedy
of
a
haunted
mind
such
are
in
which
the
ghost
is
memory
hawthorne
in
which
the
ghost
is
cruel
conscience
and
balzac
of
the
in
which
the
old
flemish
house
of
balthasar
claes
in
the
rue
de
paris
at
douai
is
haunted
by
a
dæmon
more
potent
than
that
of
canidia
one
might
add
some
of
balzac
shorter
stories
among
them
the
elixir
and
some
of
hawthorne
including
edward
randolph
portrait
on
the
french
side
we
might
note
too
that
terrible
graveyard
tale
of
guy
de
maupassant
in
which
the
lover
who
has
lost
his
beloved
keeps
vigil
at
her
grave
by
night
in
his
despair
and
sees
dreadful
resurrection
que
toutes
les
tombes
étaient
ouvertes
et
tous
les
cadavres
en
étaient
sortis
and
why
that
they
might
efface
the
lying
legends
inscribed
on
their
tombs
and
replace
them
with
the
actual
truth
villiers
de
adam
has
in
his
given
us
the
strange
story
of
véra
which
may
be
read
as
a
companion
study
to
with
another
recall
from
the
dead
to
end
a
lover
obsession
nature
and
supernature

de
mystical

a
play
which
will
never
hold

stage
masterly
attempt
as
it
is
to
dramatise
the
inexplainable
mystery

later

to
be
reckoned

john
aubrey
in
his
has
many
naïve
evidences
of
the
twilight
region
of
consciousness
like
that
between
wake
and
sleep
which
tends
to
fade
when
we
are
wideawake
so
much
so
that
we
call
it
visionary
yet
it
is
very
real
to
the
haunted
folk
to
correspondent
the
rector
of
chedzoy
or
to
the
false
love
of
the
demon
lover
or
that
mr
bourne
of
whom
glanvil
tells
in
iron
chest
of
or
the
bishop
evodius
who
was
st
augustine
friend
or
for
that
matter
the
son
of
monica
himself
the
reality
of
these
visitations
may
seem
dim
but
the
most
sceptical
of
us
can
not
doubt
that
whether
from
some
quickened
fear
of
death
or
impending
disaster
from
evil
conscience
or
swift
intensification
of
vision
whether
in
the
forms
of
beloved
sons
lost
at
sea
or
of
other
revenants
who
were
held
indispensably
dear
in
life
the
haunters
have
appeared
to
the
absolute
belief
of
those
who
saw
them
or
their
simulacra
it
poseth
me
said
richard
baxter
to
think
of
what
kind
these
visitants
are
do
good
spirits
dwell
then
so
near
us
or
are
they
sent
on
such
messages
the
question
indeed
poseth
most
of
us
but
we
can
not
leave
the
inquiry
alone
larigot
realising
this
preoccupation
has
in
the
course
of
his
investigations
during
many
years
arrived
at
the
conclusion
that
there
is
an
art
of
the
supernatural
apart
from
the
difficult
science
of
psychical
research
worth
cultivating
for
its
own
sake
so
he
has
gone
to
glanvil
and
arise
evans
and
the
credulous
old
books
to
edgar
poe
and
lord
lytton
and
the
modern
writers
who
tell
supernatural
tales
he
gives
us
their
material
without
positing
its
unquestionable
effect
as
evidence
and
if
we
recognise
its
artistic
interest
he
does
not
mind
much
if
we
say
at
last
with
one
great
visionary
hoc
est
illusionum
but
into
those
realms
of
illusion
we
ought
not
if
he
is
right
to
enter
lightly
those
who
do
enter
there
are
warned
that
having
done
so
they
will
not
remain
the
same
they
become
aware
of
what
eugenius
meant
who
said
i
am
unbody
by
thy
books
and
thee
and
in
thy
papers
find
my
extasie
or
if
i
please
but
to
descend
a
strain
thy
elements
do
screen
my
soul
again
i
can
undress
myself
by
thy
bright
glass
and
then
resume
th
inclosure
as
i
was
now
i
am
earth
and
now
a
star
and
then
a
spirit
now
a
star
and
earth
again
we
see
that
there
is
another
aspect
to
the
occultation
of
orion
and
a
very
ominous
one
aurelius
appeared
to
augustine
and
made
clear
a
dark
passage
to
him
in
his
reading
and
that
great
divine
and
father
of
the
church
knew
it
to
be
an
enlightenment
from
above
but
what
of
the
other
visitants
from
regions
that
are
unblessed
paracelsus
has
taught
us
to
be
careful
in
our
dealings
with
the
realities
and
the
phantasies
as
he
would
conceive
them
of
the
other
world
for
under
the
earth
do
wander
and
there
are
other
and
worse
manifestations
due
to
black
magic
or
nigromancy
and
to
the
black
witches
and
white
and
the
false
sorcerers
who
have
violently
intruded
into
the
true
mystery
like
swine
broken
into
a
delicate
garden
against
these
subtle
and
powerful
magicians
no
weapons
coats
of
mail
or
brigandines
will
help
no
shutting
of
doors
or
locks
for
they
penetrate
through
all
things
and
all
things
are
open
to
them
writing
as
a
physician
paracelsus
sought
to
anticipate
by
his
and
his
the
whole
mystery
of
healing
and
the
cure
of
the
troubled
souls
and
bodies
of
men
and
women
which
are
not
accorded
but
at
odds
with
nature
and
supernature
the
spirits
of
discord
are
indeed
always
with
us
and
whether
you
see
them
as
witches
disguised
in
the
living
human
form
or
as
monstrous
and
terrifying
or
as
floating
impalpable
atmospheres
they
are
vigilantly
to
be
guarded
against
we
know
vervain
and
dill
hinders
witches
from
their
will
in
the
old
herbals
but
we
need
new
drugs
as
for
that
witch
which
hath
haunted
all
of
us
maladicta
lilly
in
his
has
a
remedy
take
unguentum
populeum
and
vervain
and
hypericon
and
put
a
iron
into
it
you
must
anoint
the
or
wear
it
in
your
breast
the
haunting
apparitions
are
not
all
of
earth
cornelius
agrippa
in
his
book
of
the
secret
doctrine
shows
that
they
are
astral
too
the
familiar
spirits
of
mars
in
his
account
are
no
lovelier
than
witches
they
appear
in
a
tall
body
cholerick
a
filthy
countenance
of
colour
brown
swarthy
or
red
having
horns
like
harts
horns
and
gryphon
claws
and
bellowing
like
wild
bulls
but
the
spirits
of
mercury
are
delightful
they
indeed
are
of
colour
clear
and
bright
like
unto
a
knight
armed
and
the
motion
of
them
is
as
it
were
clouds
so
if
mars
has
troubled
the
world
as
in
the
unhappy
history
of
our
own
time
we
must
hope
for
the
brighter
forms
and
the
remedial
and
aerial
messengers
of
mercury
we
may
seem
to
have
strayed
from
the
proper
boundaries
in
going
so
far
but
it
is
one
of
the
offices
of
this
book
to
widen
the
area
of
research
and
relate
the
anew
to
the
whole
literature
of
wonder
and
imagination
such
sagas
as
that
which
dr
douglas
hyde
has
translated
with
consummate
art
from
the
irish
teig
and
the
corpse
which
mr
yeats
called
a
little
masterpiece
or
boccaccio
story
of
the
that
pulled
down
the
daughter
of
anastasio
or
wandering
willie
tale
or
hawker
cruel
coppinger
or
edgar
fall
of
the
house
of
usher
are
of
their
kind
not
to
be
beaten
and
in
their
own
way
some
of
the
later
records
are
as
telling
one
can
take
the
book
as
a
of
the
supernatural
or
as
a
of
that
middle
world
which
has
given
us
the
ghosts
that
homer
and
shakespeare
conjured
up
ernest
rhys
i
ghost
stories
from
literary
sources
i
the
fall
of
the
house
of
usher
by
edgar
allan
poe
son
coeur
est
un
luth
suspendu
sitôt
le
touche
il
résonne
de
beranger
during
the
whole
of
a
dull
dark
and
soundless
day
in
the
autumn
of
the
year
when
the
clouds
hung
oppressively
low
in
the
heavens
i
had
been
passing
alone
on
horseback
through
a
singularly
dreary
tract
of
country
and
at
length
found
myself
as
the
shades
of
the
evening
drew
on
within
view
of
the
melancholy
house
of
usher
i
know
not
how
it
was
but
with
the
first
glimpse
of
the
building
a
sense
of
insufferable
gloom
pervaded
my
spirit
i
say
insufferable
for
the
feeling
was
unrelieved
by
any
of
that
because
poetic
sentiment
with
which
the
mind
usually
receives
even
the
sternest
natural
images
of
the
desolate
or
terrible
i
looked
upon
the
scene
before
me
upon
the
mere
house
and
the
simple
landscape
features
of
the
domain
upon
the
bleak
walls
upon
the
vacant
windows
upon
a
few
rank
sedges
and
upon
a
few
white
trunks
of
decayed
trees
with
an
utter
depression
of
soul
which
i
can
compare
to
no
earthly
sensation
more
properly
than
to
the
of
the
reveller
upon
opium
the
bitter
lapse
into
everyday
life
the
hideous
dropping
off
of
the
veil
there
was
an
iciness
a
sinking
a
sickening
of
the
heart
an
unredeemed
dreariness
of
thought
which
no
goading
of
the
imagination
could
torture
into
aught
of
the
sublime
what
was
it
i
paused
to
think
what
was
it
that
so
unnerved
me
in
the
contemplation
of
the
house
of
usher
it
was
a
mystery
all
insoluble
nor
could
i
grapple
with
the
shadowy
fancies
that
crowded
upon
me
as
i
pondered
i
was
forced
to
fall
back
upon
the
unsatisfactory
conclusion
that
while
beyond
doubt
there
combinations
of
very
simple
natural
objects
which
have
the
power
of
thus
affecting
us
still
the
analysis
of
this
power
lies
among
considerations
beyond
our
depth
it
was
possible
i
reflected
that
a
mere
different
arrangement
of
the
particulars
of
the
scene
of
the
details
of
the
picture
would
be
sufficient
to
modify
or
perhaps
to
annihilate
its
capacity
for
sorrowful
impression
and
acting
upon
this
idea
i
reined
my
horse
to
the
precipitous
brink
of
a
black
and
lurid
tarn
that
lay
in
unruffled
lustre
by
the
dwelling
and
gazed
down
but
with
a
shudder
even
more
thrilling
than
before
upon
the
remodelled
and
inverted
images
of
the
grey
sedge
and
the
ghastly
and
the
vacant
and
windows
nevertheless
in
this
mansion
of
gloom
i
now
proposed
to
myself
a
sojourn
of
some
weeks
its
proprietor
roderick
usher
had
been
one
of
my
boon
companions
in
boyhood
but
many
years
had
elapsed
since
our
last
meeting
a
letter
however
had
lately
reached
me
in
a
distant
part
of
the
country
a
letter
from
him
which
in
its
wildly
importunate
nature
had
admitted
of
no
other
than
a
personal
reply
the
gave
evidence
of
nervous
agitation
the
writer
spoke
of
acute
bodily
illness
of
a
mental
disorder
which
oppressed
him
and
of
an
earnest
desire
to
see
me
as
his
best
and
indeed
his
only
personal
friend
with
a
view
of
attempting
by
the
cheerfulness
of
my
society
some
alleviation
of
his
malady
it
was
the
manner
in
which
all
this
and
much
more
was
said
it
was
the
apparent
that
went
with
his
request
which
allowed
me
no
room
for
hesitation
and
i
accordingly
obeyed
forthwith
what
i
still
considered
a
very
singular
summons
although
as
boys
we
had
been
even
intimate
associates
yet
i
really
knew
little
of
my
friend
his
reserve
had
been
always
excessive
and
habitual
i
was
aware
however
that
his
very
ancient
family
had
been
noted
time
out
of
mind
for
a
peculiar
sensibility
of
temperament
displaying
itself
through
long
ages
in
many
works
of
exalted
art
and
manifested
of
late
in
repeated
deeds
of
munificent
yet
unobtrusive
charity
as
well
as
in
a
passionate
devotion
to
the
intricacies
perhaps
even
more
than
to
the
orthodox
and
easily
recognisable
beauties
of
musical
science
i
had
learned
too
the
very
remarkable
fact
that
the
stem
of
the
usher
race
all
as
it
was
had
put
forth
at
no
period
any
enduring
branch
in
other
words
that
the
entire
family
lay
in
the
direct
line
of
descent
and
had
always
with
very
trifling
and
very
temporary
variation
so
lain
it
was
this
deficiency
i
considered
while
running
over
in
thought
the
perfect
keeping
of
the
character
of
the
premises
with
the
accredited
character
of
the
people
and
while
speculating
upon
the
possible
influence
which
the
one
in
the
long
lapse
of
centuries
might
have
exercised
upon
the
other
it
was
this
deficiency
perhaps
of
collateral
issue
and
the
consequent
undeviating
transmission
from
sire
to
son
of
the
patrimony
with
the
name
which
had
at
length
so
identified
the
two
as
to
merge
the
original
title
of
the
estate
in
the
quaint
and
equivocal
appellation
of
the
house
of
usher
an
appellation
which
seemed
to
include
in
the
minds
of
the
peasantry
who
used
it
both
the
family
and
the
family
mansion
i
have
said
that
the
sole
effect
of
my
somewhat
childish
experiment
that
of
looking
down
within
the
tarn
had
been
to
deepen
the
first
singular
impression
there
can
be
no
doubt
that
the
consciousness
of
the
rapid
increase
of
my
superstition
for
why
should
i
not
so
term
it
served
mainly
to
accelerate
the
increase
itself
such
i
have
long
known
is
the
paradoxical
law
of
all
sentiments
having
terror
as
a
basis
and
it
might
have
been
for
this
reason
only
that
when
i
again
uplifted
my
eyes
to
the
house
itself
from
its
image
in
the
pool
there
grew
in
my
mind
a
strange
fancy
a
fancy
so
ridiculous
indeed
that
i
but
mention
it
to
show
the
vivid
force
of
the
sensations
which
oppressed
me
i
had
so
worked
upon
my
imagination
as
really
to
believe
that
about
the
whole
mansion
and
domain
there
hung
an
atmosphere
peculiar
to
themselves
and
their
immediate
vicinity
an
atmosphere
which
had
no
affinity
with
the
air
of
heaven
but
which
had
reeked
up
from
the
decayed
trees
and
the
grey
wall
and
the
silent
tarn
a
pestilent
and
mystic
vapour
dull
sluggish
faintly
discernible
and
shaking
off
from
my
spirit
what
have
been
a
dream
i
scanned
more
narrowly
the
real
aspect
of
the
building
its
principal
feature
seemed
to
be
that
of
an
excessive
antiquity
the
discoloration
of
ages
had
been
great
minute
overspread
the
whole
exterior
hanging
in
a
fine
tangled
from
the
eaves
yet
all
this
was
apart
from
any
extraordinary
dilapidation
no
portion
of
the
masonry
had
fallen
and
there
appeared
to
be
a
wild
inconsistency
between
its
still
perfect
adaptation
of
parts
and
the
crumbling
condition
of
the
individual
stones
in
this
there
was
much
that
reminded
me
of
the
specious
totality
of
old
woodwork
which
has
rotted
for
long
years
in
some
neglected
vault
with
no
disturbance
from
the
breath
of
the
external
air
beyond
this
indication
of
extensive
decay
however
the
fabric
gave
little
token
of
instability
perhaps
the
eye
of
a
scrutinising
observer
might
have
discovered
a
barely
perceptible
fissure
which
extending
from
the
roof
of
the
building
in
front
made
its
way
down
the
wall
in
a
zigzag
direction
until
it
became
lost
in
the
sullen
waters
of
the
tarn
noticing
these
things
i
rode
over
a
short
causeway
to
the
house
a
servant
in
waiting
took
my
horse
and
i
entered
the
gothic
archway
of
the
hall
a
valet
of
stealthy
step
thence
conducted
me
in
silence
through
many
dark
and
intricate
passages
in
my
progress
to
the
of
his
master
much
that
i
encountered
on
the
way
contributed
i
know
not
how
to
heighten
the
vague
sentiments
of
which
i
have
already
spoken
while
the
objects
around
me
while
the
carvings
of
the
ceilings
the
sombre
tapestries
of
the
walls
the
ebon
blackness
of
the
floors
and
the
phantasmagoric
armorial
trophies
which
rattled
as
i
strode
were
but
matters
to
which
or
to
such
as
which
i
had
been
accustomed
from
my
infancy
while
i
hesitated
not
to
acknowledge
how
familiar
was
all
this
i
still
wondered
to
find
how
unfamiliar
were
the
fancies
which
ordinary
images
were
stirring
up
on
one
of
the
staircases
i
met
the
physician
of
the
family
his
countenance
i
thought
wore
a
mingled
expression
of
low
cunning
and
perplexity
he
accosted
me
with
trepidation
and
passed
on
the
valet
now
threw
open
a
door
and
ushered
me
into
the
presence
of
his
master
the
room
in
which
i
found
myself
was
very
large
and
lofty
the
windows
were
long
narrow
and
pointed
and
at
so
vast
a
distance
from
the
black
oaken
floor
as
to
be
altogether
inaccessible
from
within
feeble
gleams
of
encrimsoned
light
made
their
way
through
the
trellised
panes
and
served
to
render
sufficiently
distinct
the
more
prominent
objects
around
the
eye
however
struggled
in
vain
to
reach
the
remoter
angles
of
the
chamber
or
the
recesses
of
the
vaulted
and
fretted
ceiling
dark
draperies
hung
upon
the
walls
the
general
furniture
was
profuse
comfortless
antique
and
tattered
many
books
and
musical
instruments
lay
scattered
about
but
failed
to
give
any
vitality
to
the
scene
i
felt
that
i
breathed
an
atmosphere
of
sorrow
an
air
of
stern
deep
and
irredeemable
gloom
hung
over
and
pervaded
all
upon
my
entrance
usher
arose
from
a
sofa
on
which
he
had
been
lying
at
full
length
and
greeted
me
with
a
vivacious
warmth
which
had
much
in
it
i
at
first
thought
of
an
overdone
cordiality
of
the
constrained
effort
of
the
man
of
the
world
a
glance
however
at
his
countenance
convinced
me
of
his
perfect
sincerity
we
sat
down
and
for
some
moments
while
he
spoke
not
i
gazed
upon
him
with
a
feeling
half
of
pity
half
of
awe
surely
man
had
never
before
so
terribly
altered
in
so
brief
a
period
as
had
roderick
usher
it
was
with
difficulty
that
i
could
bring
myself
to
admit
the
identity
of
the
wan
being
before
me
with
the
companion
of
my
early
boyhood
yet
the
character
of
his
face
had
been
at
all
times
remarkable
a
cadaverousness
of
complexion
an
eye
large
liquid
and
luminous
beyond
comparison
lips
somewhat
thin
and
very
pallid
but
of
a
surpassingly
beautiful
curve
a
nose
of
a
delicate
hebrew
model
but
with
a
breadth
of
nostril
unusual
in
similar
formations
a
finely
moulded
chin
speaking
in
its
want
of
prominence
of
a
want
of
moral
energy
hair
of
a
more
than
softness
and
tenuity
these
features
with
an
inordinate
expansion
above
the
regions
of
the
temple
made
up
altogether
a
countenance
not
easily
to
be
forgotten
and
now
in
the
mere
exaggeration
of
the
prevailing
character
of
these
features
and
of
the
expression
they
were
wont
to
convey
lay
so
much
of
change
that
i
doubted
to
whom
i
spoke
the
now
ghastly
pallor
of
the
skin
and
the
now
miraculous
lustre
of
the
eye
above
all
things
startled
and
even
awed
me
the
silken
hair
too
had
been
suffered
to
grow
all
unheeded
and
as
in
its
wild
gossamer
texture
it
floated
rather
than
fell
about
the
face
i
could
not
even
with
effort
connect
its
arabesque
expression
with
any
idea
of
simple
humanity
in
the
manner
of
my
friend
i
was
at
once
struck
with
an
incoherence
an
inconsistency
and
i
soon
found
this
to
arise
from
a
series
of
feeble
and
futile
struggles
to
overcome
an
habitual
trepidancy
an
excessive
nervous
agitation
for
something
of
this
nature
i
had
indeed
been
prepared
no
less
by
his
letter
than
by
reminiscences
of
certain
boyish
traits
and
by
conclusions
deduced
from
his
peculiar
physical
conformation
and
temperament
his
action
was
alternately
vivacious
and
sullen
his
voice
varied
rapidly
from
a
tremulous
indecision
when
the
animal
spirits
seemed
utterly
in
abeyance
to
that
species
of
energetic
concision
that
abrupt
weighty
unhurried
and
enunciation
that
leaden
and
perfectly
modulated
guttural
utterance
which
may
be
observed
in
the
lost
drunkard
or
the
irreclaimable
eater
of
opium
during
the
periods
of
his
most
intense
excitement
it
was
thus
that
he
spoke
of
the
object
of
my
visit
of
his
earnest
desire
to
see
me
and
of
the
solace
he
expected
me
to
afford
him
he
entered
at
some
length
into
what
he
conceived
to
be
the
nature
of
his
malady
it
was
he
said
a
constitutional
and
a
family
evil
and
one
for
which
he
despaired
to
find
a
remedy
a
mere
nervous
affection
he
immediately
added
which
would
undoubtedly
soon
pass
on
it
displayed
itself
in
a
host
of
unnatural
sensations
some
of
these
as
he
detailed
them
interested
and
bewildered
me
although
perhaps
the
terms
and
the
general
manner
of
the
narration
had
their
weight
he
suffered
much
from
a
morbid
acuteness
of
the
senses
the
most
insipid
food
was
alone
endurable
he
could
wear
only
garments
of
certain
texture
the
odours
of
all
flowers
were
oppressive
his
eyes
were
tortured
by
even
a
faint
light
and
there
were
but
peculiar
sounds
and
these
from
stringed
instruments
which
did
not
inspire
him
with
horror
to
an
anomalous
species
of
terror
i
found
him
a
bounden
slave
i
shall
perish
said
he
i
perish
in
this
deplorable
folly
thus
thus
and
not
otherwise
shall
i
be
lost
i
dread
the
events
of
the
future
not
in
themselves
but
in
their
results
i
shudder
at
the
thought
of
any
even
the
most
trivial
incident
which
may
operate
upon
this
intolerable
agitation
of
soul
i
have
indeed
no
abhorrence
of
danger
except
in
its
absolute
effect
in
terror
in
this
unnerved
in
this
pitiable
condition
i
feel
that
the
period
will
sooner
or
later
arrive
when
i
must
abandon
life
and
reason
together
in
some
struggle
with
the
grim
phantasm
fear
i
learned
moreover
at
intervals
and
through
broken
and
equivocal
hints
another
singular
feature
of
his
mental
condition
he
was
enchained
by
certain
superstitious
impressions
in
regard
to
the
dwelling
which
he
tenanted
and
whence
for
many
years
he
had
never
ventured
forth
in
regard
to
an
influence
whose
supposititious
force
was
conveyed
in
terms
too
shadowy
here
to
be
an
influence
which
some
peculiarities
in
the
mere
form
and
substance
of
his
family
mansion
had
by
dint
of
long
sufferance
he
said
obtained
over
his
spirit
an
effect
which
the
of
the
grey
walls
and
turrets
and
of
the
dim
tarn
into
which
they
all
looked
down
had
at
length
brought
about
upon
the
of
his
existence
he
admitted
however
although
with
hesitation
that
much
of
the
peculiar
gloom
which
thus
afflicted
him
could
be
traced
to
a
more
natural
and
far
more
palpable
origin
to
the
severe
and
illness
indeed
to
the
evidently
approaching
dissolution
of
a
tenderly
beloved
sister
his
sole
companion
for
long
years
his
last
and
only
relative
on
earth
her
decease
he
said
with
a
bitterness
which
i
can
never
forget
would
leave
him
him
the
hopeless
and
the
frail
the
last
of
the
ancient
race
of
the
ushers
while
he
spoke
the
lady
madeline
for
so
was
she
called
passed
slowly
through
a
remote
portion
of
the
apartment
and
without
having
noticed
my
presence
disappeared
i
regarded
her
with
an
utter
astonishment
not
unmingled
with
dread
and
yet
i
found
it
impossible
to
account
for
such
feelings
a
sensation
of
stupor
oppressed
me
as
my
eyes
followed
her
retreating
steps
when
a
door
at
length
closed
upon
her
my
glance
sought
instinctively
and
eagerly
the
countenance
of
the
brother
but
he
had
buried
his
face
in
his
hands
and
i
could
only
perceive
that
a
far
more
than
ordinary
wanness
had
overspread
the
emaciated
fingers
through
which
trickled
many
passionate
tears
the
disease
of
the
lady
madeline
had
long
baffled
the
skill
of
her
physicians
a
settled
apathy
a
gradual
wasting
away
of
the
person
and
frequent
although
transient
affections
of
a
partially
cataleptical
character
were
the
unusual
diagnosis
hitherto
she
had
steadily
borne
up
against
the
pressure
of
her
malady
and
had
not
betaken
herself
finally
to
bed
but
on
the
closing
in
of
the
evening
of
my
arrival
at
the
house
she
succumbed
as
her
brother
told
me
at
night
with
inexpressible
agitation
to
the
prostrating
power
of
the
destroyer
and
i
learned
that
the
glimpse
i
had
obtained
of
her
person
would
thus
probably
be
the
last
i
should
obtain
that
the
lady
at
least
while
living
would
be
seen
by
me
no
more
for
several
days
ensuing
her
name
was
unmentioned
by
either
usher
or
myself
and
during
this
period
i
was
busied
in
earnest
endeavours
to
alleviate
the
melancholy
of
my
friend
we
painted
and
read
together
or
i
listened
as
if
in
a
dream
to
the
wild
improvisations
of
his
speaking
guitar
and
thus
as
a
closer
and
still
closer
intimacy
admitted
me
more
unreservedly
into
the
recesses
of
his
spirit
the
more
bitterly
did
i
perceive
the
futility
of
all
attempt
at
cheering
a
mind
from
which
darkness
as
if
an
inherent
positive
quality
poured
forth
upon
all
objects
of
the
moral
and
physical
universe
in
one
unceasing
radiation
of
gloom
i
shall
ever
bear
about
me
a
memory
of
the
many
solemn
hours
i
thus
spent
alone
with
the
master
of
the
house
of
usher
yet
i
should
fail
in
any
attempt
to
convey
an
idea
of
the
exact
character
of
the
studies
or
of
the
occupations
in
which
he
involved
me
or
led
me
the
way
an
excited
and
highly
distempered
ideality
threw
a
sulphureous
lustre
over
all
his
long
improvised
dirges
will
ring
for
ever
in
my
ears
among
other
things
i
hold
painfully
in
mind
a
certain
singular
perversion
and
amplification
of
the
wild
air
of
the
last
waltz
of
von
weber
from
the
paintings
over
which
his
elaborate
fancy
brooded
and
which
grew
touch
by
touch
into
vagueness
at
which
i
shuddered
the
more
thrillingly
because
i
shuddered
knowing
not
why
from
these
paintings
vivid
as
their
images
now
are
before
me
i
would
in
vain
endeavour
to
educe
more
than
a
small
portion
which
should
lie
within
the
compass
of
merely
written
words
by
the
utter
simplicity
by
the
nakedness
of
his
designs
he
arrested
and
overawed
attention
if
ever
mortal
painted
an
idea
that
mortal
was
roderick
usher
for
me
at
least
in
the
circumstances
then
surrounding
me
there
arose
out
of
the
pure
abstractions
which
the
hypochondriac
contrived
to
throw
upon
his
canvas
an
intensity
of
intolerable
awe
no
shadow
of
which
felt
i
ever
yet
in
the
contemplation
of
the
certainly
glowing
yet
too
concrete
reveries
of
fuseli
one
of
the
phantasmagoric
conceptions
of
my
friend
partaking
not
so
rigidly
of
the
spirit
of
abstraction
may
be
shadowed
forth
although
feebly
in
words
a
small
picture
presented
the
interior
of
an
immensely
long
and
rectangular
vault
or
tunnel
with
low
walls
smooth
white
and
without
interruption
or
device
certain
accessory
points
of
the
design
served
well
to
convey
the
idea
that
this
excavation
lay
at
an
exceeding
depth
below
the
surface
of
the
earth
no
outlet
was
observed
in
any
portion
of
its
vast
extent
and
no
torch
or
other
artificial
source
of
light
was
discernible
yet
a
flood
of
intense
rays
rolled
throughout
and
bathed
the
whole
in
a
ghastly
and
inappropriate
splendour
i
have
just
spoken
of
that
morbid
condition
of
the
auditory
nerve
which
rendered
all
music
intolerable
to
the
sufferer
with
the
exception
of
certain
effects
of
stringed
instruments
it
was
perhaps
the
narrow
limits
to
which
he
thus
confined
himself
upon
the
guitar
which
gave
birth
in
great
measure
to
the
fantastic
character
of
his
performances
but
the
fervid
of
his
could
not
be
so
accounted
for
they
must
have
been
and
were
in
the
notes
as
well
as
in
the
words
of
his
wild
fantasias
for
he
not
unfrequently
accompanied
himself
with
rhymed
verbal
improvisations
the
result
of
that
intense
mental
collectedness
and
concentration
to
which
i
have
previously
alluded
as
observable
only
in
particular
moments
of
the
highest
artificial
excitement
the
words
of
one
of
these
rhapsodies
i
have
easily
remembered
i
was
perhaps
the
more
forcibly
impressed
with
it
as
he
gave
it
because
in
the
under
or
mystic
current
of
its
meaning
i
fancied
that
i
perceived
and
for
the
first
time
a
full
consciousness
on
the
part
of
usher
of
the
tottering
of
his
lofty
reason
upon
her
throne
the
verses
which
were
entitled
the
haunted
palace
ran
very
nearly
if
not
accurately
thus
i
in
the
greenest
of
our
valleys
by
good
angels
tenanted
once
a
fair
and
stately
palace
radiant
palace
reared
its
head
in
the
monarch
thought
dominion
it
stood
there
never
seraph
spread
a
pinion
over
fabric
half
so
fair
ii
banners
yellow
glorious
golden
on
its
roof
did
float
and
flow
this
all
this
was
in
the
olden
time
long
ago
and
every
gentle
air
that
dallied
in
that
sweet
day
along
the
ramparts
plumed
and
pallid
a
winged
odour
went
away
iii
wanderers
in
that
happy
valley
through
two
luminous
windows
saw
spirits
moving
musically
to
a
lute
well
tunèd
law
round
about
a
throne
where
sitting
porphyrogene
in
state
his
glory
well
befitting
the
ruler
of
the
realm
was
seen
iv
and
all
with
pearl
and
ruby
glowing
was
the
fair
palace
door
through
which
came
flowing
flowing
flowing
and
sparkling
evermore
a
troop
of
echoes
whose
sweet
duty
was
but
to
sing
in
voices
of
surpassing
beauty
the
wit
and
wisdom
of
their
king
v
but
evil
things
in
robes
of
sorrow
assailed
the
monarch
high
estate
ah
let
us
mourn
for
never
morrow
shall
dawn
upon
him
desolate
and
round
about
his
home
the
glory
that
blushed
and
bloomed
is
but
a
story
of
the
old
time
entombed
vi
and
travellers
now
within
that
valley
through
the
windows
see
vast
forms
that
move
fantastically
to
a
discordant
melody
while
like
a
rapid
ghastly
river
through
the
pale
door
a
hideous
throng
rush
out
forever
and
laugh
but
smile
no
more
i
well
remember
that
suggestions
arising
from
this
ballad
led
us
into
a
train
of
thought
wherein
there
became
manifest
an
opinion
of
which
i
mention
not
so
much
on
account
of
its
novelty
for
other
men
have
thought
thus
as
on
account
of
the
pertinacity
with
which
he
maintained
it
this
opinion
in
its
general
form
was
that
of
the
sentience
of
all
vegetable
things
but
in
his
disordered
fancy
the
idea
had
assumed
a
more
daring
character
and
trespassed
under
certain
conditions
upon
the
kingdom
of
inorganisation
i
lack
words
to
express
the
full
extent
or
the
earnest
of
his
persuasion
the
belief
however
was
connected
as
i
have
previously
hinted
with
the
grey
stones
of
the
home
of
his
forefathers
the
conditions
of
the
sentience
had
been
here
he
imagined
fulfilled
in
the
method
of
collocation
of
these
stones
in
the
order
of
their
arrangement
as
well
as
in
that
of
the
many
which
overspread
them
and
of
the
decayed
trees
which
stood
around
above
all
in
the
long
undisturbed
endurance
of
this
arrangement
and
in
its
reduplication
in
the
still
waters
of
the
tarn
its
evidence
the
evidence
of
the
sentience
was
to
be
seen
he
said
and
i
here
started
as
he
spoke
in
the
gradual
yet
certain
condensation
of
an
atmosphere
of
their
own
about
the
waters
and
the
walls
the
result
was
discoverable
he
added
in
that
silent
yet
importunate
and
terrible
influence
which
for
centuries
had
moulded
the
destinies
of
his
family
and
which
made
what
i
now
saw
him
what
he
was
such
opinions
need
no
comment
and
i
will
make
none
our
books
the
books
which
for
years
had
formed
no
small
portion
of
the
mental
existence
of
the
invalid
were
as
might
be
supposed
in
strict
keeping
with
this
character
of
phantasm
we
pored
together
over
such
works
as
the
et
of
gresset
the
of
machiavelli
the
and
of
swedenborg
the
voyage
of
nicholas
by
holberg
the
of
robert
flud
of
jean
and
of
de
la
chambre
the
into
the
blue
of
tieck
and
the
of
the
of
campanella
one
favourite
volume
was
a
small
octavo
edition
of
the
by
the
dominican
eymeric
de
gironne
and
there
were
passages
in
about
the
old
african
satyrs
and
ægipans
over
which
usher
would
sit
dreaming
for
hours
his
chief
delight
however
was
found
in
the
perusal
of
an
exceedingly
rare
and
curious
book
in
quarto
gothic
the
manual
of
a
forgotten
church
the
mortuorum
chorum
ecclesiæ
i
could
not
help
thinking
of
the
wild
ritual
of
this
work
and
of
its
probable
influence
upon
the
hypochondriac
when
one
evening
having
informed
me
abruptly
that
the
lady
madeline
was
no
more
he
stated
his
intention
of
preserving
her
corpse
for
a
fortnight
previously
to
its
final
interment
in
one
of
the
numerous
vaults
within
the
main
walls
of
the
building
the
worldly
reason
however
assigned
for
this
singular
proceeding
was
one
which
i
did
not
feel
at
liberty
to
dispute
the
brother
had
been
led
to
his
resolution
so
he
told
me
by
consideration
of
the
unusual
character
of
the
malady
of
the
deceased
of
certain
obtrusive
and
eager
inquiries
on
the
part
of
her
medical
men
and
of
the
remote
and
exposed
situation
of
the
of
the
family
i
will
not
deny
that
when
i
called
to
mind
the
sinister
countenance
of
the
person
whom
i
met
upon
the
staircase
on
the
day
of
my
arrival
at
the
house
i
had
no
desire
to
oppose
what
i
regarded
as
at
best
but
a
harmless
and
by
no
means
an
unnatural
precaution
at
the
request
of
usher
i
personally
aided
him
in
the
arrangements
for
the
temporary
entombment
the
body
having
been
encoffined
we
two
alone
bore
it
to
its
rest
the
vault
in
which
we
placed
it
and
which
had
been
so
long
unopened
that
our
torches
half
smothered
in
its
oppressive
atmosphere
gave
us
little
opportunity
for
investigation
was
small
damp
and
entirely
without
means
of
admission
for
light
lying
at
great
depth
immediately
beneath
that
portion
of
the
building
in
which
was
my
own
sleeping
apartment
it
had
been
used
apparently
in
remote
feudal
times
for
the
worst
purpose
of
a
and
in
later
days
as
a
place
of
deposit
for
powder
or
some
other
highly
combustible
substance
as
a
portion
of
its
floor
and
the
whole
interior
of
a
long
archway
through
which
we
reached
it
were
carefully
sheathed
with
copper
the
door
of
massive
iron
had
been
also
similarly
protected
its
immense
weight
caused
an
unusually
sharp
grating
sound
as
it
moved
upon
its
hinges
having
deposited
our
mournful
burden
upon
tressels
within
this
region
of
horror
we
partially
turned
aside
the
yet
unscrewed
lid
of
the
coffin
and
looked
upon
the
face
of
the
tenant
a
striking
similitude
between
the
brother
and
sister
now
first
arrested
my
attention
and
usher
divining
perhaps
my
thoughts
murmured
out
some
few
words
from
which
i
learned
that
the
deceased
and
himself
had
been
twins
and
that
sympathies
of
a
scarcely
intelligible
nature
had
always
existed
between
them
our
glances
however
rested
not
long
upon
the
dead
for
we
could
not
regard
her
unawed
the
disease
which
had
thus
entombed
the
lady
in
the
maturity
of
youth
had
left
as
usual
in
all
maladies
of
a
strictly
cataleptical
character
the
mockery
of
a
faint
blush
upon
the
bosom
and
the
face
and
that
suspiciously
lingering
smile
upon
the
lip
which
is
so
terrible
in
death
we
replaced
and
screwed
down
the
lid
and
having
secured
the
door
of
iron
made
our
way
with
toil
into
the
scarcely
less
gloomy
apartments
of
the
upper
portion
of
the
house
and
now
some
days
of
bitter
grief
having
elapsed
an
observable
change
came
over
the
features
of
the
mental
disorder
of
my
friend
his
ordinary
manner
had
vanished
his
ordinary
occupations
were
neglected
or
forgotten
he
roamed
from
chamber
to
chamber
with
hurried
unequal
and
objectless
step
the
pallor
of
his
countenance
had
assumed
if
possible
a
more
ghastly
hue
but
the
luminousness
of
his
eye
had
utterly
gone
out
the
once
occasional
huskiness
of
his
tone
was
heard
no
more
and
a
tremulous
quaver
as
if
of
extreme
terror
habitually
characterised
his
utterance
there
were
times
indeed
when
i
thought
his
unceasingly
agitated
mind
was
labouring
with
some
oppressive
secret
to
divulge
which
he
struggled
for
the
necessary
courage
at
times
again
i
was
obliged
to
resolve
all
into
the
mere
inexplicable
vagaries
of
madness
for
i
beheld
him
gazing
upon
vacancy
for
long
hours
in
an
attitude
of
the
profoundest
attention
as
if
listening
to
some
imaginary
sound
it
was
no
wonder
that
his
condition
terrified
that
it
infected
me
i
felt
creeping
upon
me
by
slow
yet
certain
degrees
the
wild
influences
of
his
own
fantastic
yet
impressive
superstitions
it
was
especially
upon
retiring
to
bed
late
in
the
night
of
the
seventh
or
eighth
day
after
the
placing
of
the
lady
madeline
within
the
donjon
that
i
experienced
the
full
power
of
such
feelings
sleep
came
not
near
my
couch
while
the
hours
waned
and
waned
away
i
struggled
to
reason
off
the
nervousness
which
had
dominion
over
me
i
endeavoured
to
believe
that
much
if
not
all
of
what
i
felt
was
due
to
the
bewildering
influence
of
the
gloomy
furniture
of
the
room
of
the
dark
and
tattered
draperies
which
tortured
into
motion
by
the
breath
of
a
rising
tempest
swayed
fitfully
to
and
fro
upon
the
walls
and
rustled
uneasily
about
the
decorations
of
the
bed
but
my
efforts
were
fruitless
an
irrepressible
tremor
gradually
pervaded
my
frame
and
at
length
there
sat
upon
my
very
heart
an
incubus
of
utterly
causeless
alarm
shaking
this
off
with
a
gasp
and
a
struggle
i
uplifted
myself
upon
the
pillows
and
peering
earnestly
within
the
intense
darkness
of
the
chamber
hearkened
i
know
not
why
except
that
an
instinctive
spirit
prompted
me
to
certain
low
and
indefinite
sounds
which
came
through
the
pauses
of
the
storm
at
long
intervals
i
knew
not
whence
overpowered
by
an
intense
sentiment
of
horror
unaccountable
yet
unendurable
i
threw
on
my
clothes
with
haste
for
i
felt
that
i
should
sleep
no
more
during
the
night
and
endeavoured
to
arouse
myself
from
the
pitiable
condition
into
which
i
had
fallen
by
pacing
rapidly
to
and
fro
through
the
apartment
i
had
taken
but
a
few
turns
in
this
manner
when
a
light
step
on
an
adjoining
staircase
arrested
my
attention
i
presently
recognised
it
as
that
of
usher
in
an
instant
afterward
he
rapped
with
a
gentle
touch
at
my
door
and
entered
bearing
a
lamp
his
countenance
was
as
usual
cadaverously
wan
but
moreover
there
was
a
species
of
mad
hilarity
in
his
eyes
an
evidently
restrained
in
his
whole
demeanour
his
air
appalled
me
but
anything
was
preferable
to
the
solitude
which
i
had
so
long
endured
and
i
even
welcomed
his
presence
as
a
relief
and
you
have
not
seen
it
he
said
abruptly
after
having
stared
about
him
for
some
moments
in
silence
you
have
not
then
seen
it
but
stay
you
shall
thus
speaking
and
having
carefully
shaded
his
lamp
he
hurried
to
one
of
the
casements
and
threw
it
freely
open
to
the
storm
the
impetuous
fury
of
the
entering
gust
nearly
lifted
us
from
our
feet
it
was
indeed
a
tempestuous
yet
sternly
beautiful
night
and
one
wildly
singular
in
its
terror
and
its
beauty
a
whirlwind
had
apparently
collected
its
force
in
our
vicinity
for
there
were
frequent
and
violent
alterations
in
the
direction
of
the
wind
and
the
exceeding
density
of
the
clouds
which
hung
so
low
as
to
press
upon
the
turrets
of
the
house
did
not
prevent
our
perceiving
the
lifelike
velocity
with
which
they
flew
careering
from
all
points
against
each
other
without
passing
away
into
the
distance
i
say
that
even
their
exceeding
density
did
not
prevent
our
perceiving
this
yet
we
had
no
glimpse
of
the
moon
or
stars
nor
was
there
any
flashing
forth
of
the
lightning
but
the
under
surfaces
of
the
huge
masses
of
agitated
vapour
as
well
as
all
terrestrial
objects
immediately
around
us
were
glowing
in
the
unnatural
light
of
a
faintly
luminous
and
distinctly
visible
gaseous
exhalation
which
hung
about
and
enshrouded
the
mansion
you
must
not
you
shall
not
behold
this
said
i
shudderingly
to
usher
as
i
led
him
with
a
gentle
violence
from
the
window
to
a
seat
these
appearances
which
bewilder
you
are
merely
electrical
phenomena
not
uncommon
or
it
may
be
that
they
have
their
ghastly
origin
in
the
rank
miasma
of
the
tarn
let
us
close
this
casement
the
air
is
chilling
and
dangerous
to
your
frame
here
is
one
of
your
favourite
romances
i
will
read
and
you
shall
listen
and
so
we
will
pass
away
this
terrible
night
together
the
antique
volume
which
i
had
taken
up
was
the
of
sir
launcelot
canning
but
i
had
called
it
a
favourite
of
usher
more
in
sad
jest
than
in
earnest
for
in
truth
there
is
little
in
its
uncouth
and
unimaginative
prolixity
which
could
have
had
interest
for
the
lofty
and
spiritual
ideality
of
my
friend
it
was
however
the
only
book
immediately
at
hand
and
i
indulged
a
vague
hope
that
the
excitement
which
now
agitated
the
hypochondriac
might
find
relief
for
the
history
of
mental
disorder
is
full
of
similar
anomalies
even
in
the
extremeness
of
the
folly
which
i
should
read
could
i
have
judged
indeed
by
the
wild
overstrained
air
of
vivacity
with
which
he
hearkened
or
apparently
hearkened
to
the
words
of
the
tale
i
might
well
have
congratulated
myself
upon
the
success
of
my
design
i
had
arrived
at
that
portion
of
the
story
where
ethelred
the
hero
of
the
trist
having
sought
in
vain
for
peaceable
admission
into
the
dwelling
of
the
hermit
proceeds
to
make
good
an
entrance
by
force
here
it
will
be
remembered
the
words
of
the
narrative
run
thus
and
ethelred
who
was
by
nature
of
a
doughty
heart
and
who
was
now
mighty
withal
on
account
of
the
powerfulness
of
the
wine
which
he
had
drunken
waited
no
longer
to
hold
parley
with
the
hermit
who
in
sooth
was
of
an
obstinate
and
maliceful
turn
but
feeling
the
rain
upon
his
shoulders
and
fearing
the
rising
of
the
tempest
uplifted
his
mace
outright
and
with
blows
made
quickly
room
in
the
plankings
of
the
door
for
his
gauntleted
hand
and
now
pulling
therewith
sturdily
he
so
cracked
and
ripped
and
tore
all
asunder
that
the
noise
of
the
dry
and
wood
alarmed
and
reverberated
throughout
the
forest
at
the
termination
of
this
sentence
i
started
and
for
a
moment
paused
for
it
appeared
to
me
although
i
at
once
concluded
that
my
excited
fancy
had
deceived
me
it
appeared
to
me
that
from
some
very
remote
portion
of
the
mansion
there
came
indistinctly
to
my
ears
what
might
have
been
in
its
exact
similarity
of
character
the
echo
but
a
stifled
and
dull
one
certainly
of
the
very
cracking
and
ripping
sound
which
sir
launcelot
had
so
particularly
described
it
was
beyond
doubt
the
coincidence
alone
which
had
arrested
my
attention
for
amid
the
rattling
of
the
sashes
of
the
casements
and
the
ordinary
commingled
noises
of
the
still
increasing
storm
the
sound
in
itself
had
nothing
surely
which
should
have
interested
or
disturbed
me
i
continued
the
story
but
the
good
champion
ethelred
now
entering
within
the
door
was
sore
enraged
and
amazed
to
perceive
no
signal
of
the
maliceful
hermit
but
in
the
stead
thereof
a
dragon
of
a
scaly
and
prodigious
demeanour
and
of
a
fiery
tongue
which
sate
in
guard
before
a
palace
of
gold
with
a
floor
of
silver
and
upon
the
wall
there
hung
a
shield
of
shining
brass
with
this
legend
enwritten
who
entereth
herein
a
conqueror
hath
bin
who
slayeth
the
dragon
the
shield
he
shall
win
and
ethelred
uplifted
his
mace
and
struck
upon
the
head
of
the
dragon
which
fell
before
him
and
gave
up
his
pesty
breath
with
a
shriek
so
horrid
and
harsh
and
withal
so
piercing
that
ethelred
had
fain
to
close
his
ears
with
his
hands
against
the
dreadful
noise
of
it
the
like
whereof
was
never
before
heard
here
again
i
paused
abruptly
and
now
with
a
feeling
of
wild
amazement
for
there
could
be
no
doubt
whatever
that
in
this
instance
i
did
actually
hear
although
from
what
direction
it
proceeded
i
found
it
impossible
to
say
a
low
and
apparently
distant
but
harsh
protracted
and
most
unusual
screaming
or
grating
sound
the
exact
counterpart
of
what
my
fancy
had
already
conjured
up
for
the
unnatural
shriek
as
described
by
the
romancer
oppressed
as
i
certainly
was
upon
the
occurrence
of
the
second
and
most
extraordinary
coincidence
by
a
thousand
conflicting
sensations
in
which
wonder
and
extreme
terror
were
predominant
i
still
retained
sufficient
presence
of
mind
to
avoid
exciting
by
any
observation
the
sensitive
nervousness
of
my
companion
i
was
by
no
means
certain
that
he
had
noticed
the
sounds
in
question
although
assuredly
a
strange
alteration
had
during
the
last
few
minutes
taken
place
in
his
demeanour
from
a
position
fronting
my
own
he
had
gradually
brought
round
his
chair
so
as
to
sit
with
his
face
to
the
door
of
the
chamber
and
thus
i
could
but
partially
perceive
his
features
although
i
saw
that
his
lips
trembled
as
if
he
were
murmuring
inaudibly
his
head
had
dropped
upon
his
breast
yet
i
knew
that
he
was
not
asleep
from
the
wide
and
rigid
opening
of
the
eye
as
i
caught
a
glance
of
it
in
profile
the
motion
of
his
body
too
was
at
variance
with
this
idea
for
he
rocked
from
side
to
side
with
a
gentle
yet
constant
and
uniform
sway
having
rapidly
taken
notice
of
all
this
i
resumed
the
narrative
of
sir
launcelot
which
thus
proceeded
and
now
the
champion
having
escaped
from
the
terrible
fury
of
the
dragon
bethinking
himself
of
the
brazen
shield
and
of
the
breaking
up
of
the
enchantment
which
was
upon
it
removed
the
carcass
from
out
of
the
way
before
him
and
approached
valorously
over
the
silver
pavement
of
the
castle
to
where
the
shield
was
upon
the
wall
which
in
sooth
tarried
not
for
his
full
coming
but
fell
down
at
his
feet
upon
the
silver
floor
with
a
mighty
great
and
terrible
ringing
sound
no
sooner
had
these
syllables
passed
my
lips
than
as
if
a
shield
of
brass
had
indeed
at
the
moment
fallen
heavily
upon
a
floor
of
silver
i
became
aware
of
a
distinct
hollow
metallic
and
clangorous
yet
apparently
muffled
reverberation
completely
unnerved
i
leaped
to
my
feet
but
the
measured
rocking
movement
of
usher
was
undisturbed
i
rushed
to
the
chair
on
which
he
sat
his
eyes
were
bent
fixedly
before
him
and
throughout
his
whole
countenance
there
reigned
a
stony
rigidity
but
as
i
placed
my
hand
upon
his
shoulder
there
came
a
strong
shudder
over
his
whole
person
a
sickly
smile
quivered
about
his
lips
and
i
saw
that
he
spoke
in
a
low
hurried
and
gibbering
murmur
as
if
unconscious
of
my
presence
bending
closely
over
him
i
at
length
drank
in
the
hideous
import
of
his
words
not
hear
it
yes
i
hear
it
and
heard
it
long
long
long
many
minutes
many
hours
many
days
have
i
heard
it
yet
i
dared
not
pity
me
miserable
wretch
that
i
am
i
dared
not
i
not
speak
have
put
her
living
in
the
tomb
said
i
not
that
my
senses
were
acute
i
tell
you
that
i
heard
her
first
feeble
movements
in
the
hollow
coffin
i
heard
them
many
many
days
ago
yet
i
dared
not
dared
not
speak
and
now
ethelred
ha
ha
the
breaking
of
the
hermit
door
and
the
of
the
dragon
and
the
clangour
of
the
shield
say
rather
the
rending
of
her
coffin
and
the
grating
of
the
iron
hinges
of
her
prison
and
her
struggles
within
the
coppered
archway
of
the
vault
oh
whither
shall
i
fly
will
she
not
be
here
anon
is
she
not
hurrying
to
upbraid
me
for
my
haste
have
i
not
heard
her
footstep
on
the
stair
do
i
not
distinguish
that
heavy
and
horrible
beating
of
her
heart
madman
here
he
sprang
furiously
to
his
feet
and
shrieked
out
his
syllables
as
if
in
the
effort
he
were
giving
up
his
soul
madman
i
tell
you
that
she
now
stands
without
the
door
as
if
in
the
superhuman
energy
of
his
utterance
there
had
been
found
the
potency
of
a
spell
the
huge
antique
panels
to
which
the
speaker
pointed
threw
slowly
back
upon
the
instant
their
ponderous
and
ebony
jaws
it
was
the
work
of
the
rushing
gust
but
then
without
those
doors
there
did
stand
the
lofty
and
enshrouded
figure
of
the
lady
madeline
of
usher
there
was
blood
upon
her
white
robes
and
the
evidence
of
some
bitter
struggle
upon
every
portion
of
her
emaciated
frame
for
a
moment
she
remained
trembling
and
reeling
to
and
fro
upon
the
threshold
then
with
a
low
moaning
cry
fell
heavily
inward
upon
the
person
of
her
brother
and
in
her
violent
and
now
final
bore
him
to
the
floor
a
corpse
and
a
victim
to
the
terrors
he
had
anticipated
from
that
chamber
and
from
that
mansion
i
fled
aghast
the
storm
was
still
abroad
in
all
its
wrath
as
i
found
myself
crossing
the
old
causeway
suddenly
there
shot
along
the
path
a
wild
light
and
i
turned
to
see
whence
a
gleam
so
unusual
could
have
issued
for
the
vast
house
and
its
shadows
were
alone
behind
me
the
radiance
was
that
of
the
full
setting
and
moon
which
now
shone
vividly
through
that
once
barely
discernible
fissure
of
which
i
have
before
spoken
as
extending
from
the
roof
of
the
building
in
a
zigzag
direction
to
the
base
while
i
gazed
this
fissure
rapidly
widened
there
came
a
fierce
breath
of
the
whirlwind
the
entire
orb
of
the
satellite
burst
at
once
upon
my
sight
my
brain
reeled
as
i
saw
the
mighty
walls
rushing
asunder
there
was
a
long
tumultuous
shouting
sound
like
the
voice
of
a
thousand
waters
and
the
deep
and
dank
tarn
at
my
feet
closed
sullenly
and
silently
over
the
fragments
of
the
house

ii
the
old
nurse
story
from
the
portent
by
george
macdonald
i
set
out
one
evening
for
the
cottage
of
my
old
nurse
to
bid
her
for
many
months
probably
years
i
was
to
leave
the
next
day
for
edinburgh
on
my
way
to
london
whence
i
had
to
repair
by
coach
to
my
new
abode
almost
to
me
like
the
land
beyond
the
grave
so
little
did
i
know
about
it
and
so
wide
was
the
separation
between
it
and
my
home
the
evening
was
sultry
when
i
began
my
walk
and
before
i
arrived
at
its
end
the
clouds
rising
from
all
quarters
of
the
horizon
and
especially
gathering
around
the
peaks
of
the
mountain
betokened
the
near
approach
of
a
thunderstorm
this
was
a
great
delight
to
me
gladly
would
i
take
leave
of
my
home
with
the
memory
of
a
last
night
of
tumultuous
magnificence
followed
probably
by
a
day
of
weeping
rain
well
suited
to
the
mood
of
my
own
heart
in
bidding
farewell
to
the
best
of
parents
and
the
dearest
of
homes
besides
in
common
with
most
scotchmen
who
are
young
and
hardy
enough
to
be
unable
to
realise
the
existence
of
coughs
and
rheumatic
fevers
it
was
a
positive
pleasure
to
me
to
be
out
in
rain
hail
or
snow
i
am
come
to
bid
you
margaret
and
to
hear
the
story
which
you
promised
to
tell
me
before
i
left
home
i
go
do
you
go
so
soon
my
darling
well
it
will
be
an
awful
night
to
tell
it
in
but
as
i
promised
i
suppose
i
must
at
the
moment
two
or
three
great
drops
of
rain
the
first
of
the
storm
fell
down
the
wide
chimney
exploding
in
the
clear
yes
indeed
you
must
i
replied
after
a
short
pause
she
commenced
of
course
she
spoke
in
gaelic
and
i
translate
from
my
recollection
of
the
gaelic
but
rather
from
the
impression
left
upon
my
mind
than
from
any
recollection
of
words
she
drew
her
chair
near
the
fire
which
we
had
reason
to
fear
would
soon
be
put
out
by
the
falling
rain
and
began
how
old
the
story
is
i
do
not
know
it
has
come
down
through
many
generations
my
grandmother
told
it
to
me
as
i
tell
it
to
you
and
her
mother
and
my
mother
sat
beside
never
interrupting
but
nodding
their
heads
at
every
turn
almost
it
ought
to
begin
like
the
fairy
tales
upon
a
it
took
place
so
long
ago
but
it
is
too
dreadful
and
too
true
to
tell
like
a
fairy
there
were
two
brothers
sons
of
the
chief
of
our
clan
but
as
different
in
appearance
and
disposition
as
two
men
could
be
the
elder
was
and
strong
much
given
to
hunting
and
fishing
fighting
too
upon
occasion
i
daresay
when
they
made
a
foray
upon
the
saxon
to
get
back
a
mouthful
of
their
own
but
he
was
gentleness
itself
to
everyone
about
him
and
the
very
soul
of
honour
in
all
his
doings
the
younger
was
very
dark
in
complexion
and
tall
and
slender
compared
to
his
brother
he
was
very
fond
of
which
they
say
was
an
uncommon
taste
in
those
times
he
did
not
care
for
any
sports
or
bodily
exercises
but
one
and
that
too
was
unusual
in
these
parts
it
was
horsemanship
he
was
a
fierce
rider
and
as
much
at
home
in
the
saddle
as
in
his
you
may
think
that
so
long
ago
there
was
not
much
fit
room
for
riding
hereabouts
but
fit
or
not
fit
he
rode
from
his
reading
and
riding
the
neighbours
looked
doubtfully
upon
him
and
whispered
about
the
black
art
he
usually
bestrode
a
great
powerful
black
horse
without
a
white
hair
on
him
and
people
said
it
was
either
the
devil
himself
or
a
from
the
devil
own
stud
what
favoured
this
notion
was
that
in
or
out
of
the
stable
the
brute
would
let
no
other
than
his
master
go
near
him
indeed
no
one
would
venture
after
he
had
killed
two
men
and
grievously
maimed
a
third
tearing
him
with
his
teeth
and
hoofs
like
a
wild
beast
but
to
his
master
he
was
obedient
as
a
hound
and
would
even
tremble
in
his
presence
sometimes
the
youth
temper
corresponded
to
his
habits
he
was
both
gloomy
and
passionate
prone
to
anger
he
had
never
been
known
to
forgive
debarred
from
anything
on
which
he
had
set
his
heart
he
would
have
gone
mad
with
longing
if
he
had
not
gone
mad
with
rage
his
soul
was
like
the
night
around
us
now
dark
and
sultry
and
silent
but
lighted
up
by
the
red
levin
of
wrath
and
torn
by
the
bellowings
of
he
must
have
his
will
hell
might
have
his
soul
imagine
then
the
rage
and
malice
in
his
heart
when
he
suddenly
became
aware
that
an
orphan
girl
distantly
related
to
them
who
had
lived
with
them
for
nearly
two
years
and
whom
he
had
loved
for
almost
all
that
period
was
loved
by
his
elder
brother
and
loved
him
in
return
he
flung
his
right
hand
above
his
head
and
swore
a
terrible
oath
that
if
he
might
not
his
brother
should
not
rushed
out
of
the
house
and
galloped
off
among
the
hills
the
orphan
was
a
beautiful
girl
tall
pale
and
slender
with
plentiful
dark
hair
which
when
released
from
the
snood
rippled
down
below
her
knees
her
appearance
formed
a
strong
contrast
with
that
of
her
favoured
lover
while
there
was
some
resemblance
between
her
and
the
younger
brother
this
fact
seemed
to
his
fierce
selfishness
ground
for
a
prior
claim
it
may
appear
strange
that
a
man
like
him
should
not
have
had
instant
recourse
to
his
superior
and
hidden
knowledge
by
means
of
which
he
might
have
got
rid
of
his
rival
with
far
more
of
certainty
and
less
of
risk
but
i
presume
that
for
the
moment
his
passion
overwhelmed
his
consciousness
of
skill
yet
i
do
not
suppose
that
he
foresaw
the
mode
in
which
his
hatred
was
about
to
operate
at
the
moment
when
he
learned
their
mutual
attachment
probably
through
a
domestic
the
lady
was
on
her
way
to
meet
her
lover
as
he
returned
from
the
day
sport
the
appointed
place
was
on
the
edge
of
a
deep
rocky
ravine
down
in
whose
dark
bosom
brawled
and
foamed
a
little
mountain
torrent
you
know
the
place
duncan
my
dear
i
daresay
here
she
gave
me
a
minute
description
of
the
spot
with
directions
how
to
find
it
whether
any
one
saw
what
i
am
about
to
relate
or
whether
it
was
put
together
afterwards
i
can
not
tell
the
story
is
like
an
old
tree
so
old
that
it
has
lost
the
marks
of
its
growth
but
this
is
how
my
grandmother
told
it
to
me
an
evil
chance
led
him
in
the
right
direction
the
lovers
startled
by
the
sound
of
the
approaching
horse
parted
in
opposite
directions
along
a
narrow
on
the
edge
of
the
ravine
into
this
path
he
struck
at
a
point
near
where
the
lovers
had
met
but
to
opposite
sides
of
which
they
had
now
receded
so
that
he
was
between
them
on
the
path
turning
his
horse
up
the
course
of
the
stream
he
soon
came
in
sight
of
his
brother
on
the
ledge
before
him
with
a
suppressed
scream
of
rage
he
rode
headlong
at
him
and
ere
he
had
time
to
make
the
least
defence
hurled
him
over
the
precipice
the
helplessness
of
the
strong
man
was
uttered
in
one
single
despairing
cry
as
he
shot
into
the
abyss
then
all
was
still
the
sound
of
his
fall
could
not
reach
the
edge
of
the
gulf
divining
in
a
moment
that
the
lady
whose
name
was
elsie
must
have
fled
in
the
opposite
direction
he
reined
his
steed
on
his
haunches
he
could
touch
the
precipice
with
his
half
outstretched
his
half
outstretched
would
have
dropped
a
stone
to
the
bottom
of
the
ravine
there
was
no
room
to
wheel
one
desperate
practibility
alone
remained
turning
his
head
towards
the
edge
he
compelled
him
by
means
of
the
powerful
bit
to
rear
till
he
stood
almost
erect
and
so
his
body
swaying
over
the
gulf
with
quivering
and
straining
muscles
to
turn
on
his
hind
legs
having
completed
the
he
let
him
drop
and
urged
him
furiously
in
the
opposite
direction
it
must
have
been
by
the
own
care
that
he
was
able
to
continue
his
gallop
along
that
ledge
of
rock
he
soon
caught
sight
of
the
maiden
she
was
leaning
half
fainting
against
the
precipice
she
had
beard
her
lover
last
cry
and
although
it
had
conveyed
no
suggestion
of
his
voice
to
her
ear
she
trembled
from
head
to
foot
and
her
limbs
would
bear
her
no
farther
he
checked
his
speed
rode
gently
up
to
her
lifted
her
unresisting
laid
her
across
the
shoulders
of
his
horse
and
riding
carefully
till
he
reached
a
more
open
path
dashed
again
wildly
along
the
mountain
side
the
lady
long
hair
was
shaken
loose
and
dropped
trailing
on
the
ground
the
horse
trampled
upon
it
and
stumbled
half
dragging
her
from
the
he
caught
her
lifted
her
up
and
looked
at
her
face
she
was
dead
i
suppose
he
went
mad
he
laid
her
again
across
the
saddle
before
him
and
rode
on
reckless
whither
horse
and
man
and
maiden
were
found
the
next
day
lying
at
the
foot
of
a
cliff
dashed
to
pieces
it
was
observed
that
a
hind
shoe
of
the
horse
was
loose
and
broken
whether
this
had
been
the
cause
of
his
fall
could
not
be
told
but
ever
when
he
races
as
race
he
will
till
the
day
of
doom
along
that
mountain
side
his
gallop
is
mingled
with
the
clank
of
the
loose
and
broken
shoe
for
like
the
sin
the
punishment
is
awful
he
shall
carry
about
for
ages
the
of
the
girl
knowing
that
her
soul
is
away
sitting
with
the
soul
of
his
brother
down
in
the
deep
ravine
or
scaling
with
him
the
topmost
crags
of
the
towering
mountain
peaks
there
are
some
who
from
time
to
time
see
the
doomed
man
careering
along
the
face
of
the
mountain
with
the
lady
hanging
across
the
steed
and
they
say
it
always
betokens
a
storm
such
as
this
which
is
now
raving
about
us
i
had
not
noticed
till
now
so
absorbed
had
i
been
in
her
tale
that
the
storm
had
risen
to
a
very
ecstasy
of
fury
they
say
likewise
that
the
lady
hair
is
still
growing
for
every
time
they
see
her
it
is
longer
than
before
and
that
now
such
is
its
length
and
the
headlong
speed
of
the
horse
that
it
floats
and
streams
out
behind
like
one
of
those
curved
clouds
like
a
comet
tail
far
up
in
the
sky
only
the
cloud
is
white
and
the
hair
dark
as
night
and
they
say
it
will
go
on
growing
until
the
last
day
when
the
horse
will
falter
and
her
hair
will
gather
in
and
the
horse
will
fall
and
the
hair
will
twist
and
twine
and
wreathe
itself
like
a
mist
of
threads
about
him
and
blind
him
to
everything
but
her
then
the
body
will
rise
up
within
it
face
to
face
with
him
animated
by
a
fiend
who
twining
arms
around
him
will
drag
him
down
to
the
bottomless
pit
i
may
mention
something
which
now
occurred
and
which
had
a
strange
effect
on
my
old
nurse
it
illustrates
the
assertion
that
we
see
around
us
only
what
is
within
us
marvellous
things
enough
will
show
themselves
to
the
marvellous
mood
during
a
short
lull
in
the
storm
just
as
she
had
finished
her
story
we
heard
the
sound
of
hoofs
approaching
the
cottage
there
was
no
into
the
glen
a
knock
came
to
the
door
and
on
opening
it
we
saw
an
old
man
seated
on
a
horse
with
a
long
sack
lying
across
the
saddle
before
him
he
said
he
had
lost
the
path
in
the
storm
and
seeing
the
light
had
scrambled
down
to
inquire
his
way
i
perceived
at
once
from
the
scared
and
mysterious
look
of
the
old
woman
eyes
that
she
was
persuaded
that
this
appearance
had
more
than
a
little
to
do
with
the
awful
rider
the
terrific
storm
and
myself
who
had
heard
the
sound
of
the
phantom
hoofs
as
he
ascended
the
hill
she
looked
after
him
with
wide
and
pale
but
unshrinking
eyes
then
turning
in
shut
and
locked
the
door
behind
her
as
by
a
natural
instinct
after
two
or
three
of
her
significant
nods
accompanied
by
the
compression
of
her
lips
she
said
he
need
not
think
to
take
me
in
wizard
as
he
is
with
his
disguises
i
can
see
him
through
them
all
duncan
my
dear
when
you
suspect
anything
do
not
be
too
incredulous
this
human
demon
is
of
course
a
wizard
still
and
knows
how
to
make
himself
as
well
as
anything
he
touches
take
a
quite
different
appearance
from
the
real
one
only
every
appearance
must
bear
some
resemblance
however
distant
to
the
natural
form
that
man
you
saw
at
the
door
was
the
phantom
of
which
i
have
been
telling
you
what
he
is
after
now
of
course
i
can
not
tell
but
you
must
keep
a
bold
heart
and
a
firm
and
wary
foot
as
you
go
home
i
showed
some
surprise
i
do
not
doubt
and
perhaps
some
fear
as
well
but
i
only
said
how
do
you
know
him
margaret
i
can
hardly
tell
you
she
replied
but
i
do
know
him
i
think
he
hates
me
often
of
a
wild
night
when
there
is
moonlight
enough
by
fits
i
see
him
tearing
round
this
little
valley
just
on
the
top
edge
all
round
the
lady
hair
and
the
horse
mane
and
tail
driving
far
behind
and
mingling
vaporous
with
the
stormy
clouds
about
he
goes
in
wild
careering
gallop
now
lost
as
the
moon
goes
in
then
visible
far
round
when
she
looks
out
again
an
airy
spectre
which
few
eyes
but
mine
could
see
for
as
far
as
i
am
aware
no
one
of
the
family
but
myself
has
ever
possessed
the
double
gift
of
seeing
and
hearing
both
in
this
case
i
hear
no
sound
except
now
and
then
a
clank
from
the
broken
shoe
but
i
did
not
mean
to
tell
you
that
i
had
ever
seen
him
i
am
not
a
bit
afraid
of
him
he
can
not
do
more
than
he
may
his
power
is
limited
else
ill
enough
would
he
work
the
miscreant
but
said
i
what
has
all
this
terrible
as
it
is
to
do
with
the
fright
you
took
at
my
telling
you
that
i
had
heard
the
sound
of
the
broken
shoe
surely
you
are
not
afraid
of
only
a
storm
no
my
boy
i
fear
no
storm
but
the
fact
is
that
that
sound
is
seldom
heard
and
never
as
far
as
i
know
by
any
of
the
blood
of
that
wicked
man
without
betokening
some
ill
to
one
of
the
family
and
most
probably
to
the
one
who
hears
it
but
i
am
not
quite
sure
about
that
only
some
evil
it
does
portend
although
a
long
time
may
elapse
before
it
shows
itself
and
i
have
a
hope
it
may
mean
some
one
else
than
you
do
not
wish
that
i
replied
i
know
no
one
better
able
to
bear
it
than
i
am
and
i
hope
whatever
it
may
be
that
i
only
shall
have
to
meet
it
it
must
surely
be
something
serious
to
be
so
foretold
it
can
hardly
be
connected
with
my
disappointment
in
being
compelled
to
be
a
pedagogue
instead
of
a
soldier
do
not
trouble
yourself
about
that
duncan
replied
she
a
soldier
you
must
be
the
same
day
you
told
me
of
the
clank
of
the
broken
horseshoe
i
saw
you
return
wounded
from
battle
and
fall
fainting
from
your
horse
in
the
street
of
a
great
city
only
fainting
thank
god
but
i
have
particular
reasons
for
being
uneasy
at
hearing
that
boding
sound
can
you
tell
me
the
day
and
hour
of
your
birth
no
i
replied
it
seems
very
odd
when
i
think
of
it
but
i
really
do
not
know
even
the
day
nor
any
one
else
which
is
stranger
still
she
answered
how
does
that
happen
nurse
we
were
in
terrible
anxiety
about
your
mother
at
the
time
so
ill
was
she
after
you
were
just
born
in
a
strange
unaccountable
way
that
you
lay
almost
neglected
for
more
than
an
hour
in
the
very
act
of
giving
birth
to
you
she
seemed
to
the
rest
around
her
to
be
out
of
her
mind
so
wildly
did
she
talk
but
i
knew
better
i
knew
that
she
was
fighting
some
evil
power
and
what
power
it
was
i
knew
full
well
for
twice
during
her
pains
i
heard
the
click
of
the
horseshoe
but
no
one
could
help
her
after
her
delivery
she
lay
as
if
in
a
trance
neither
dead
nor
at
rest
but
as
if
frozen
to
ice
and
conscious
of
it
all
the
while
once
more
i
heard
the
terrible
sound
of
iron
and
at
the
moment
your
mother
started
from
her
trance
screaming
child
my
child
we
suddenly
became
aware
that
no
one
had
attended
to
the
child
and
rushed
to
the
place
where
he
lay
wrapped
in
a
blanket
uncovering
him
we
found
him
black
in
the
face
and
spotted
with
dark
spots
upon
the
throat
i
thought
he
was
dead
but
with
great
and
almost
hopeless
pains
we
succeeded
in
making
him
breathe
and
he
gradually
recovered
but
his
mother
continued
dreadfully
exhausted
it
seemed
as
if
she
had
spent
her
life
for
her
child
defence
and
birth
that
was
you
duncan
my
dear
i
was
in
constant
attendance
upon
her
about
a
week
after
your
birth
as
near
as
i
can
guess
just
in
the
gloaming
i
heard
yet
again
the
awful
clank
only
once
nothing
followed
till
about
midnight
your
mother
slept
and
you
lay
asleep
beside
her
i
sat
by
the
bedside
a
horror
fell
upon
me
suddenly
though
i
neither
saw
nor
heard
anything
your
mother
started
from
her
sleep
with
a
cry
which
sounded
as
if
it
came
from
far
away
out
of
a
dream
and
did
not
belong
to
this
world
my
blood
curdled
with
fear
she
sat
up
in
bed
with
wide
staring
eyes
and
rigid
lips
and
feeble
as
she
was
thrust
her
arms
straight
out
before
her
with
great
force
her
hands
open
and
lifted
up
with
the
palms
outwards
the
whole
action
was
of
one
violently
repelling
another
she
began
to
talk
wildly
as
she
had
done
before
you
were
born
but
though
i
seemed
to
hear
and
understand
it
all
at
the
time
i
could
not
recall
a
word
of
it
afterwards
it
was
as
if
i
had
listened
to
it
when
half
asleep
i
attempted
to
soothe
her
putting
my
arms
round
her
but
she
seemed
quite
unconscious
of
my
presence
and
my
arms
seemed
powerless
upon
the
fixed
muscles
of
hers
not
that
i
tried
to
constrain
her
for
i
knew
that
a
battle
was
going
on
of
some
kind
or
other
and
my
interference
might
do
awful
mischief
i
only
tried
to
comfort
and
encourage
her
all
the
time
i
was
in
a
state
of
indescribable
cold
and
suffering
whether
more
bodily
or
mental
i
could
not
tell
but
at
length
i
heard
yet
again
the
clank
of
the
shoe
a
sudden
peace
seemed
to
fall
upon
my
mind
or
was
it
a
warm
odorous
wind
that
filled
the
room
your
mother
dropped
her
arms
and
turned
feebly
towards
her
baby
she
saw
that
he
slept
a
blessed
sleep
she
smiled
like
a
glorified
spirit
and
fell
back
exhausted
on
the
pillow
i
went
to
the
other
side
of
the
room
to
get
a
cordial
when
i
returned
to
the
bedside
i
saw
at
once
that
she
was
dead
her
face
smiled
still
with
an
expression
of
the
uttermost
bliss
nurse
ceased
trembling
as
overcome
by
the
recollection
and
i
was
too
much
moved
and
awed
to
speak
at
length
resuming
the
conversation
she
said
you
see
it
is
no
wonder
duncan
my
dear
if
after
all
this
i
should
find
when
i
wanted
to
fix
the
date
of
your
birth
that
i
could
not
determine
the
day
or
the
hour
when
it
took
place
all
was
confusion
in
my
poor
brain
but
it
was
strange
that
no
one
else
could
any
more
than
i
one
thing
only
i
can
tell
you
about
it
as
i
carried
you
across
the
room
to
lay
you
down
for
i
assisted
at
your
birth
i
happened
to
look
up
to
the
window
then
i
saw
what
i
did
not
forget
although
i
did
not
think
of
it
again
till
many
days
after
a
bright
star
was
shining
on
the
very
tip
of
the
thin
crescent
moon
oh
then
said
i
it
is
possible
to
determine
the
day
and
the
very
hour
when
my
birth
took
place
see
the
good
of
replied
she
when
you
work
it
out
just
let
me
know
my
dear
that
i
may
remember
it
that
i
will
a
silence
of
some
moments
followed
margaret
resumed
i
am
afraid
you
will
laugh
at
my
foolish
fancies
duncan
but
in
thinking
over
all
these
things
as
you
may
suppose
i
often
do
lying
awake
in
my
lonely
bed
the
notion
sometimes
comes
to
me
what
if
my
duncan
be
the
youth
whom
his
wicked
brother
hurled
into
the
ravine
come
again
in
a
new
body
to
live
out
his
life
cut
short
by
his
hatred
if
so
his
persecution
of
you
and
of
your
mother
for
your
sake
is
easy
to
understand
and
if
so
you
will
never
be
able
to
rest
till
you
find
your
fere
wherever
she
may
have
been
born
on
the
face
of
the
earth
for
born
she
must
be
long
ere
now
for
you
to
find
i
misdoubt
me
much
however
if
you
will
find
her
without
great
conflict
and
suffering
between
for
the
powers
of
darkness
will
be
against
you
though
i
have
good
hope
that
you
will
overcome
at
last
you
must
forgive
the
fancies
of
a
foolish
old
woman
my
dear
i
will
not
try
to
describe
the
strange
feelings
almost
sensations
that
arose
in
me
while
listening
to
these
extraordinary
utterances
lest
it
should
be
supposed
i
was
ready
to
believe
all
that
margaret
narrated
or
concluded
i
could
not
help
doubting
her
sanity
but
no
more
could
i
help
feeling
peculiarly
moved
by
her
narrative
few
more
words
were
spoken
on
either
side
but
after
receiving
renewed
exhortations
to
carefulness
on
the
way
home
i
said
to
dear
old
nurse
considerably
comforted
i
must
confess
that
i
was
not
doomed
to
be
a
tutor
all
my
days
for
i
never
questioned
the
truth
of
that
vision
and
its
consequent
prophecy
i
went
out
into
the
midst
of
the
storm
into
the
alternating
throbs
of
blackness
and
radiance
now
the
possessor
of
no
more
room
than
what
my
body
filled
and
now
isolated
in
space
and
the
thunder
seemed
to
follow
me
bellowing
after
me
as
i
went
absorbed
in
the
story
i
had
heard
i
took
my
way
as
i
thought
homewards
the
whole
country
was
well
known
to
me
i
should
have
said
before
that
night
that
i
could
have
gone
home
blindfold
whether
the
lightning
bewildered
me
and
made
me
take
a
false
turn
i
can
not
tell
for
the
hardest
thing
to
understand
in
intellectual
as
well
as
moral
mistakes
is
how
we
came
to
go
wrong
but
after
wandering
for
some
time
plunged
in
meditation
and
with
no
warning
whatever
of
the
presence
of
inimical
powers
a
brilliant
showed
me
that
at
least
i
was
not
near
home
the
light
was
prolonged
for
a
second
or
two
by
a
slight
electric
pulsation
and
by
that
i
distinguished
a
wide
space
of
blackness
on
the
ground
in
front
of
me
once
more
wrapt
in
the
folds
of
a
thick
darkness
i
dared
not
move
suddenly
it
occurred
to
me
what
the
blackness
was
and
whither
i
had
wandered
it
was
a
huge
quarry
of
great
depth
long
disused
and
half
filled
with
water
i
knew
the
place
perfectly
a
few
more
steps
would
have
carried
me
over
the
brink
i
stood
still
waiting
for
the
next
flash
that
i
might
be
quite
sure
of
the
way
i
was
about
to
take
before
i
ventured
to
move
while
i
stood
i
fancied
i
heard
a
single
hollow
plunge
in
the
black
water
far
below
when
the
lightning
came
i
turned
and
took
my
path
in
another
direction
after
walking
for
some
time
across
the
heath
i
fell
the
fall
became
a
roll
and
down
a
steep
declivity
i
went
over
and
over
arriving
at
the
bottom
uninjured
another
flash
soon
showed
me
where
i
was
in
the
hollow
valley
within
a
couple
of
hundred
yards
from
nurse
cottage
i
made
my
way
towards
it
there
was
no
light
in
it
except
the
feeblest
glow
from
the
embers
of
her
peat
fire
she
is
in
bed
i
said
to
myself
and
i
will
not
disturb
her
yet
something
drew
me
towards
the
little
window
i
looked
in
at
first
i
could
see
nothing
at
length
as
i
kept
gazing
i
saw
something
indistinct
in
the
darkness
like
an
outstretched
human
form
by
this
time
the
storm
had
lulled
the
moon
had
been
up
for
some
time
but
had
been
quite
concealed
by
tempestuous
clouds
now
however
these
had
begun
to
break
up
and
while
i
stood
looking
into
the
cottage
they
scattered
away
from
the
face
of
the
moon
and
a
faint
vapoury
gleam
of
her
light
entering
the
cottage
through
a
window
opposite
that
at
which
i
stood
fell
directly
on
the
face
of
my
old
nurse
as
she
lay
on
her
back
outstretched
upon
chairs
pale
as
death
and
with
her
eyes
closed
the
light
fell
nowhere
but
on
her
face
a
stranger
to
her
habits
would
have
thought
that
she
was
dead
but
she
had
so
much
of
the
appearance
she
had
had
on
a
former
occasion
that
i
concluded
at
once
she
was
in
one
of
her
trances
but
having
often
heard
that
persons
in
such
a
condition
ought
not
to
be
disturbed
and
feeling
quite
sure
she
knew
best
how
to
manage
herself
i
turned
though
reluctantly
and
left
the
lone
cottage
behind
me
in
the
night
with
the
woman
lying
motionless
in
the
midst
of
it
i
found
my
way
home
without
any
further
difficulty
and
went
to
bed
where
i
soon
fell
asleep
thoroughly
wearied
more
by
the
mental
excitement
i
had
been
experiencing
than
by
the
amount
of
bodily
exercise
i
had
gone
through
my
sleep
was
tormented
with
awful
dreams
yet
strange
to
say
i
awoke
in
the
morning
refreshed
and
fearless
the
sun
was
shining
through
the
chinks
in
my
shutters
which
had
been
closed
because
of
the
storm
and
was
making
streaks
and
bands
of
golden
brilliancy
upon
the
wall
i
had
dressed
and
completed
my
preparations
long
before
i
heard
the
steps
of
the
servant
who
came
to
call
me
what
a
wonderful
thing
waking
is
the
time
of
the
ghostly
moonshine
passes
by
and
the
great
positive
sunlight
comes
a
man
who
dreams
and
knows
that
he
is
dreaming
thinks
he
knows
what
waking
is
but
knows
it
so
little
that
he
mistakes
one
after
another
many
a
vague
and
dim
change
in
his
dream
for
an
awaking
when
the
true
waking
comes
at
last
he
is
filled
and
overflowed
with
the
power
of
its
reality
so
likewise
one
who
in
the
darkness
lies
waiting
for
the
light
about
to
be
struck
and
trying
to
conceive
with
all
the
force
of
his
imagination
what
the
light
will
be
like
is
yet
when
the
reality
flames
up
before
him
seized
as
by
a
new
and
unexpected
thing
different
from
and
beyond
all
his
imagining
he
feels
as
if
the
darkness
were
cast
to
an
infinite
distance
behind
him
so
shall
it
be
with
us
when
we
wake
from
this
dream
of
life
into
the
truer
life
beyond
and
find
all
our
present
notions
of
being
thrown
back
as
into
a
dim
vapoury
region
of
dreamland
where
yet
we
thought
we
knew
and
whence
we
looked
forward
into
the
present
this
must
be
what
novalis
means
when
he
says
our
life
is
not
a
dream
but
it
may
become
a
dream
and
perhaps
ought
to
become
one
and
so
i
look
back
upon
the
strange
history
of
my
past
sometimes
asking
myself
can
it
be
that
all
this
has
really
happened
to
the
same
who
am
now
thinking
about
it
in
doubt
and
wonderment
iii
the
superstitious
man
story
by
thomas
hardy
there
was
something
very
strange
about
william
death
very
strange
indeed
sighed
a
melancholy
man
in
the
back
of
the
van
it
was
the
seedman
father
who
had
hitherto
kept
silence
and
what
might
that
have
been
asked
mr
lackland
william
as
you
may
know
was
a
curious
silent
man
you
could
feel
when
he
came
near
and
if
he
was
in
the
house
or
anywhere
behind
you
without
your
seeing
him
there
seemed
to
be
something
clammy
in
the
air
as
if
a
cellar
door
opened
close
by
your
elbow
well
one
sunday
at
a
time
that
william
was
in
very
good
health
to
all
appearance
the
bell
that
was
ringing
for
church
went
very
heavy
all
of
a
sudden
the
sexton
who
told
me
said
he
had
not
known
the
bell
go
so
heavy
in
his
hand
for
years
it
was
just
as
if
the
gudgeons
wanted
oiling
that
was
on
the
sunday
as
i
say
during
the
week
after
it
chanced
that
william
wife
was
staying
up
late
one
night
to
finish
her
ironing
she
doing
the
washing
for
mr
and
mrs
hardcome
her
husband
had
finished
his
supper
and
gone
to
bed
as
usual
some
hour
or
two
before
while
she
ironed
she
heard
him
coming
downstairs
he
stopped
to
put
on
his
boots
at
the
where
he
always
left
them
and
then
came
on
into
the
where
she
was
ironing
passing
through
it
towards
the
door
this
being
the
only
way
from
the
staircase
to
the
outside
of
the
house
no
word
was
said
on
either
side
william
not
being
a
man
given
to
much
speaking
and
his
wife
being
occupied
with
her
work
he
went
out
and
closed
the
door
behind
him
as
her
husband
had
now
and
then
gone
out
in
this
way
at
night
before
when
unwell
or
unable
to
sleep
for
want
of
a
pipe
she
took
no
particular
notice
and
continued
at
her
ironing
this
she
finished
shortly
after
and
as
he
had
not
come
in
she
waited
awhile
for
him
putting
away
the
irons
and
things
and
preparing
the
table
for
his
breakfast
in
the
morning
still
he
did
not
return
but
supposing
him
not
far
off
and
wanting
to
go
to
bed
herself
tired
as
she
was
she
left
the
door
unbarred
and
went
to
the
stairs
after
writing
on
the
back
of
the
door
with
chalk
and
do
the
because
he
was
a
forgetful
man
to
her
great
surprise
and
i
might
say
alarm
on
reaching
the
foot
of
the
stairs
his
boots
were
standing
there
as
they
always
stood
when
he
had
gone
to
rest
going
up
to
their
chamber
she
found
him
in
bed
sleeping
as
sound
as
a
rock
how
he
could
have
got
back
again
without
her
seeing
or
hearing
him
was
beyond
her
comprehension
it
could
only
have
been
by
passing
behind
her
very
quietly
while
she
was
bumping
with
the
iron
but
this
notion
did
not
satisfy
her
it
was
surely
impossible
that
she
should
not
have
seen
him
come
in
through
a
room
so
small
she
could
not
unravel
the
mystery
and
felt
very
queer
and
uncomfortable
about
it
however
she
would
not
disturb
him
to
question
him
then
and
went
to
bed
herself
he
rose
and
left
for
his
work
very
early
the
next
morning
before
she
was
awake
and
she
waited
his
return
to
breakfast
with
much
anxiety
for
an
explanation
for
thinking
over
the
matter
by
daylight
made
it
seem
only
the
more
startling
when
he
came
in
to
the
meal
he
said
before
she
could
put
her
question
the
meaning
of
them
words
chalked
on
the
door
she
told
him
and
asked
him
about
his
going
out
the
night
before
william
declared
that
he
had
never
left
the
bedroom
after
entering
it
having
in
fact
undressed
lain
down
and
fallen
asleep
directly
never
once
waking
till
the
clock
struck
five
and
he
rose
up
to
go
to
his
labour
betty
privett
was
as
certain
in
her
own
mind
that
he
did
go
out
as
she
was
of
her
own
existence
and
was
little
less
certain
that
he
did
not
return
she
felt
too
disturbed
to
argue
with
him
and
let
the
subject
drop
as
though
she
must
have
been
mistaken
when
she
was
walking
down
longpuddle
street
later
in
the
day
she
met
jim
weedle
daughter
nancy
and
said
nancy
you
do
look
sleepy
mrs
privett
said
nancy
do
tell
anybody
but
i
mind
letting
you
know
what
the
reason
is
last
night
being
old
midsummer
eve
some
of
us
church
porch
and
did
get
home
till
near
one
ye
says
mrs
privett
midsummer
yesterday
was
it
faith
i
did
think
was
midsummer
or
michaelmas
i
too
much
work
to
do
and
we
were
frightened
enough
i
can
tell
by
what
we
saw
did
ye
see
you
may
not
remember
sir
having
gone
off
to
foreign
parts
so
young
that
on
midsummer
night
it
is
believed
hereabout
that
the
faint
shapes
of
all
the
folk
in
the
parish
who
are
going
to
be
at
death
door
within
the
year
can
be
seen
entering
the
church
those
who
get
over
their
illness
come
out
again
after
awhile
those
that
are
doomed
to
die
do
not
return
did
you
see
asked
william
wife
says
nancy
backwardly
need
tell
what
we
saw
or
who
we
saw
saw
my
husband
said
betty
privett
in
a
quiet
way
since
you
put
it
so
says
nancy
hanging
fire
thought
we
did
see
him
but
it
was
darkish
and
we
was
frightened
and
of
course
it
might
not
have
been
he
you
need
mind
letting
it
out
though
is
kept
back
in
kindness
and
he
did
come
out
of
the
church
again
i
know
it
as
well
as
you
nancy
did
not
answer
yes
or
no
to
that
and
no
more
was
said
but
three
days
after
william
privett
was
mowing
with
john
chiles
in
mr
meadow
and
in
the
heat
of
the
day
they
sat
down
to
their
bit
o
nunch
under
a
tree
and
empty
their
flagon
afterwards
both
of
fell
asleep
as
they
sat
john
chiles
was
the
first
to
wake
and
as
he
looked
towards
his
he
saw
one
of
those
great
white
as
we
call
that
is
to
say
a
miller
moth
come
from
william
open
mouth
while
he
slept
and
fly
straight
away
john
thought
it
odd
enough
as
william
had
worked
in
a
mill
for
several
years
when
he
was
a
boy
he
then
looked
at
the
sun
and
found
by
the
place
that
they
had
slept
a
long
while
and
as
william
did
not
wake
john
called
to
him
and
said
it
was
high
time
to
begin
work
again
he
took
no
notice
and
then
john
went
up
and
shook
him
and
found
he
was
dead
now
on
that
very
day
old
philip
hookhorn
was
down
at
longpuddle
spring
dipping
up
a
pitcher
of
water
and
as
he
turned
away
who
should
he
see
coming
down
to
the
spring
on
the
other
side
but
william
looking
very
pale
and
old
this
surprised
philip
hookhorn
very
much
for
years
before
that
time
william
little
son
his
only
child
had
been
drowned
in
that
spring
while
at
play
there
and
this
had
so
preyed
upon
william
mind
that
he
never
been
seen
near
the
spring
afterwards
and
had
been
known
to
go
half
a
mile
out
of
his
way
to
avoid
the
place
on
enquiry
it
was
found
that
william
in
body
could
not
have
stood
by
the
spring
being
in
the
mead
two
miles
off
and
it
also
came
out
that
at
the
time
at
which
he
was
seen
at
the
spring
was
the
very
time
when
he
died
a
rather
melancholy
story
observed
the
emigrant
after
a
silence
yes
yes
well
we
must
take
ups
and
downs
together
said
the
seedman
father
iv
a
story
of
ravenna
by
boccaccio
ravenna
being
a
very
ancient
city
in
romagna
there
dwelt
sometime
a
great
number
of
worthy
gentlemen
among
whom
i
am
to
speak
of
one
more
especially
named
anastasio
descended
from
the
family
of
onesti
who
by
the
death
of
his
father
and
an
uncle
of
his
was
left
extraordinarily
abounding
in
riches
and
growing
to
years
fitting
for
marriage
as
young
gallants
are
easily
apt
enough
to
do
he
became
enamoured
of
a
very
beautiful
gentlewoman
who
was
daughter
of
messer
paolo
traversario
one
of
the
most
ancient
and
noble
families
in
all
the
country
nor
made
he
any
doubt
by
his
means
and
industrious
endeavour
to
derive
affection
from
her
again
for
he
carried
himself
like
a
braveminded
gentleman
liberal
in
his
expenses
honest
and
affable
in
all
his
actions
which
commonly
are
the
true
notes
of
a
good
nature
and
highly
to
be
commended
in
any
man
but
howsoever
fortune
became
his
enemy
these
laudable
parts
of
manhood
did
not
any
way
friend
him
but
rather
appeared
hurtful
to
himself
so
cruel
unkind
and
almost
merely
savage
did
she
show
herself
to
him
perhaps
in
pride
of
her
singular
beauty
or
presuming
on
her
nobility
by
birth
both
which
are
rather
blemishes
than
ornaments
in
a
woman
when
they
be
especially
abused
the
harsh
and
uncivil
usage
in
her
grew
very
distasteful
to
anastasio
and
so
insufferable
that
after
a
long
time
of
fruitless
service
requited
still
with
nothing
but
coy
disdain
desperate
resolutions
entered
into
his
brain
and
often
he
was
minded
to
kill
himself
but
better
thoughts
supplanting
those
furious
passions
he
abstained
from
such
a
violent
act
and
governed
by
mere
manly
consideration
determined
that
as
she
hated
him
he
would
requite
her
with
the
like
if
he
could
wherein
he
became
altogether
deceived
because
as
his
hopes
grew
to
a
daily
decaying
yet
his
love
enlarged
itself
more
and
more
thus
anastasio
persevering
still
in
his
bootless
affection
and
his
expenses
not
limited
within
any
compass
it
appeared
in
the
judgment
of
his
kindred
and
friends
that
he
was
fallen
into
a
mighty
consumption
both
of
his
body
and
means
in
which
respects
many
times
they
advised
him
to
leave
the
city
of
ravenna
and
live
in
some
other
place
for
such
a
while
as
might
set
a
more
moderate
stint
upon
his
spendings
and
bridle
the
indiscreet
course
of
his
love
the
only
fuel
which
fed
his
furious
fire
anastasio
held
out
thus
a
long
time
without
lending
an
ear
to
such
friendly
counsel
but
in
the
end
he
was
so
closely
followed
by
them
as
being
no
longer
able
to
deny
them
he
promised
to
accomplish
their
request
whereupon
making
such
extraordinary
preparation
as
if
he
were
to
set
out
thence
for
france
or
spain
or
else
into
some
further
country
he
mounted
on
horseback
and
accompanied
with
some
few
of
his
familiar
friends
departed
from
ravenna
and
rode
to
a
country
of
his
own
about
three
or
four
miles
distant
from
the
city
at
a
place
called
chiassi
and
there
upon
a
very
good
green
erecting
divers
tents
and
pavilions
such
as
great
persons
make
use
of
in
the
time
of
progress
he
said
to
his
friends
which
came
with
him
thither
that
there
he
determined
to
make
his
abiding
they
all
returning
back
unto
ravenna
and
coming
to
visit
him
again
so
often
as
they
pleased
now
it
came
to
pass
that
about
the
beginning
of
may
it
being
then
a
very
mild
and
serene
season
and
he
leading
there
a
much
more
magnificent
life
than
ever
he
had
done
before
inviting
divers
to
dine
with
him
this
day
and
as
many
and
not
to
leave
him
till
after
supper
upon
a
sudden
falling
into
remembrance
of
his
cruel
mistress
he
commanded
all
his
servants
to
forbear
his
company
and
suffer
him
to
walk
alone
by
himself
a
while
because
he
had
occasion
of
private
meditations
wherein
he
would
not
by
any
means
be
troubled
it
was
then
about
the
ninth
hour
of
the
day
and
he
walking
on
solitary
all
alone
having
gone
some
half
a
mile
distance
from
the
tents
entered
into
a
grove
of
never
minding
or
anything
else
but
only
the
unkind
requital
of
his
love
suddenly
he
heard
the
voice
of
a
woman
seeming
to
make
most
mournful
complaints
which
breaking
off
his
silent
considerations
made
him
to
lift
up
his
head
to
know
the
reason
of
this
noise
when
he
saw
himself
so
far
entered
into
the
grove
before
he
could
imagine
where
he
was
he
looked
amazedly
round
about
him
and
out
of
a
little
thicket
of
bushes
and
briars
round
engirt
with
spreading
trees
he
espied
a
young
damsel
come
running
towards
him
naked
from
the
middle
upward
her
hair
lying
on
her
shoulders
and
her
fair
skin
rent
and
torn
with
the
briars
and
brambles
so
that
the
blood
ran
trickling
down
mainly
she
weeping
wringing
her
hands
and
crying
out
for
mercy
so
loud
as
she
could
two
fierce
bloodhounds
also
followed
swiftly
after
and
where
their
teeth
took
hold
did
most
cruelly
bite
her
last
of
all
mounted
on
a
lusty
black
courser
came
galloping
a
knight
with
a
very
stern
and
angry
countenance
holding
a
drawn
short
sword
in
his
hand
giving
her
very
dreadful
speeches
and
threatening
every
minute
to
kill
her
this
strange
and
uncouth
sight
bred
in
him
no
mean
admiration
as
also
kind
compassion
to
the
unfortunate
woman
out
of
which
compassion
sprung
an
earnest
desire
to
deliver
her
if
he
could
from
a
death
so
full
of
anguish
and
horror
but
seeing
himself
to
be
without
arms
he
ran
and
plucked
up
the
plant
of
a
tree
which
handling
as
if
it
had
been
a
staff
he
opposed
himself
against
the
dogs
and
the
knight
who
seeing
him
coming
cried
out
in
this
manner
to
him
anastasio
put
not
thyself
in
any
opposition
but
refer
to
my
hounds
and
me
to
punish
this
wicked
woman
as
she
hath
justly
deserved
and
in
speaking
these
words
the
hounds
took
fast
hold
on
her
body
so
staying
her
until
the
knight
was
come
nearer
to
her
and
alighted
from
his
horse
when
anastasio
after
some
other
angry
speeches
spake
thus
to
him
i
can
not
tell
what
or
who
thou
art
albeit
thou
takest
such
knowledge
of
me
yet
i
must
say
it
is
mere
cowardice
in
a
knight
being
armed
as
thou
art
to
offer
to
kill
a
naked
woman
and
make
thy
dogs
thus
to
seize
on
her
as
if
she
were
a
savage
beast
therefore
believe
me
i
will
defend
her
so
far
as
i
am
able
anastasio
answered
the
knight
i
am
of
the
same
city
as
thou
art
and
do
well
remember
that
thou
wast
a
little
lad
when
i
who
was
then
named
guido
anastasio
and
thine
uncle
became
as
entirely
in
love
with
this
woman
as
now
thou
art
with
paolo
traversario
daughter
but
through
her
coy
disdain
and
cruelty
such
was
my
heavy
fate
that
desperately
i
slew
myself
with
this
short
sword
which
thou
beholdest
in
mine
hand
for
which
rash
sinful
deed
i
was
and
am
condemned
to
eternal
punishment
this
wicked
woman
rejoicing
immeasurably
in
mine
unhappy
death
remained
no
long
time
alive
after
me
and
for
her
merciless
sin
of
cruelty
and
taking
pleasure
in
my
oppressing
torments
dying
unrepentant
and
in
pride
of
her
scorn
she
had
the
like
sentence
of
condemnation
pronounced
on
her
and
was
sent
to
the
same
place
where
i
was
condemned
there
the
three
impartial
judges
imposed
this
further
infliction
on
us
both
namely
that
she
should
fly
in
this
manner
before
me
and
i
who
loved
her
so
dearly
while
i
lived
must
pursue
her
as
my
deadly
enemy
not
like
a
woman
that
had
a
taste
of
love
in
her
and
so
often
as
i
can
overtake
her
i
am
to
kill
her
with
this
sword
the
same
weapon
wherewith
i
slew
myself
then
am
i
enjoined
therewith
to
open
her
accursed
body
and
tear
out
her
heart
with
her
other
inwards
as
now
thou
seest
me
do
which
i
give
to
my
hounds
to
feed
on
afterward
such
is
the
appointment
of
the
supreme
powers
that
she
life
again
even
as
if
she
had
not
been
dead
at
all
and
falling
to
the
same
kind
of
flight
i
with
my
hounds
am
still
to
follow
her
without
any
respite
or
intermission
every
friday
and
just
at
this
hour
our
course
is
this
way
where
she
suffereth
the
just
punishment
inflicted
on
her
nor
do
we
rest
any
of
the
other
days
but
are
appointed
unto
other
places
where
she
cruelly
executed
her
malice
against
me
who
am
now
of
her
dear
affectionate
friend
ordained
to
be
her
endless
enemy
and
to
pursue
her
in
this
manner
for
so
many
years
as
she
exercised
months
of
cruelty
towards
me
hinder
me
not
then
in
being
the
executioner
of
divine
justice
for
all
thy
interposition
is
but
in
vain
in
seeking
to
cross
the
appointment
of
supreme
powers
anastasio
having
heard
all
this
discourse
his
hair
stood
upright
like
porcupines
quills
and
his
soul
was
so
shaken
with
the
terror
that
he
stepped
back
to
suffer
the
knight
to
do
what
he
was
enjoined
looking
yet
with
mild
commiseration
on
the
poor
woman
who
kneeling
most
humbly
before
the
knight
and
sternly
seized
on
by
the
two
bloodhounds
he
opened
her
breast
with
his
weapon
drawing
forth
her
heart
and
bowels
which
instantly
he
threw
to
the
dogs
and
they
devoured
them
very
greedily
soon
after
the
damsel
as
if
none
of
this
punishment
had
been
inflicted
on
her
started
up
suddenly
running
amain
towards
the
seashore
and
the
hounds
swiftly
following
her
as
the
knight
did
the
like
after
he
had
taken
his
sword
and
was
mounted
on
horseback
so
that
anastasio
had
soon
lost
all
sight
of
them
and
could
not
guess
what
could
become
of
them
after
he
had
heard
and
observed
all
these
things
he
stood
a
while
as
confounded
with
fear
and
pity
like
a
simple
silly
man
hoodwinked
with
his
own
passions
not
knowing
the
subtle
enemy
cunning
illusions
in
offering
false
suggestions
to
the
sight
to
work
his
own
ends
thereby
and
increase
the
number
of
his
deceived
servants
forthwith
he
persuaded
himself
that
he
might
make
good
use
of
this
woman
tormenting
so
justly
imposed
on
the
knight
to
prosecute
if
thus
it
should
continue
still
every
friday
wherefore
setting
a
good
note
or
mark
upon
the
place
he
returned
back
to
his
own
people
and
at
such
times
as
he
thought
convenient
sent
for
divers
of
his
kindred
and
friends
from
ravenna
who
being
present
with
him
thus
he
spake
to
them
dear
kinsmen
and
friends
ye
have
long
while
importuned
me
to
discontinue
my
love
to
her
whom
you
all
think
and
i
find
to
be
my
mortal
enemy
as
also
to
give
over
my
lavish
expenses
wherein
i
confess
myself
too
prodigal
both
which
requests
of
yours
i
will
condescend
to
provided
that
you
will
perform
one
gracious
favour
for
me
namely
that
on
friday
next
messer
paolo
traversario
his
wife
daughter
with
all
other
women
linked
in
lineage
to
them
and
such
beside
only
as
you
shall
please
to
appoint
will
vouchsafe
to
accept
a
dinner
here
with
me
as
for
the
reason
thereto
moving
me
you
shall
then
more
at
large
be
acquainted
withal
this
appeared
no
difficult
matter
for
them
to
accomplish
wherefore
being
returned
to
ravenna
and
as
they
found
the
time
answerable
to
their
purpose
they
invited
such
as
anastasio
had
appointed
them
and
although
they
found
it
somewhat
a
hard
matter
to
gain
her
company
whom
he
had
so
dearly
affected
yet
notwithstanding
the
other
women
won
her
along
with
them
a
most
magnificent
dinner
had
anastasio
provided
and
the
tables
were
covered
under
the
where
he
saw
the
cruel
lady
so
pursued
and
slain
directing
the
guests
so
in
their
seating
that
the
young
gentlewoman
his
unkind
mistress
sate
with
her
face
opposite
unto
the
place
where
the
dismal
spectacle
was
to
be
seen
about
the
closing
up
of
dinner
they
began
to
hear
the
noise
of
the
poor
persecuted
woman
which
drove
them
all
to
much
admiration
desiring
to
know
what
it
was
and
no
one
resolving
them
they
rose
from
the
tables
and
looking
directly
as
the
noise
came
to
them
they
espied
the
woful
woman
the
dogs
eagerly
pursuing
her
the
knight
galloping
after
them
with
his
drawn
weapon
and
came
very
near
unto
the
company
who
cried
out
with
loud
exclaims
against
the
dogs
and
the
knights
stepped
forth
in
assistance
of
the
injured
woman
the
knight
spake
unto
them
as
formerly
he
had
done
to
anastasio
which
made
them
draw
back
possessed
with
fear
and
admiration
while
he
acted
the
same
cruelty
as
he
did
the
friday
before
not
differing
in
the
least
degree
most
of
the
gentlewomen
there
present
being
near
allied
to
the
unfortunate
woman
and
likewise
to
the
knight
remembering
well
both
his
love
and
death
did
shed
tears
as
plentifully
as
if
it
had
been
to
the
very
persons
themselves
in
usual
performance
of
the
action
indeed
which
tragical
scene
being
passed
over
and
the
woman
and
knight
gone
out
of
their
sight
all
that
had
seen
this
strange
accident
fell
into
diversity
of
confused
opinions
yet
not
daring
to
disclose
them
as
doubting
some
further
danger
to
ensue
thereon
but
beyond
all
the
rest
none
could
compare
in
fear
and
astonishment
with
the
cruel
young
maid
affected
by
anastasio
who
both
saw
and
observed
all
with
a
more
inward
apprehension
knowing
very
well
that
the
moral
of
this
dismal
spectacle
carried
a
much
nearer
application
to
her
than
any
other
in
the
company
for
now
she
could
call
to
mind
how
unkind
and
cruel
she
had
shown
herself
to
anastasio
even
as
the
other
gentlewoman
formerly
did
to
her
lover
still
flying
from
him
in
great
contempt
and
scorn
for
which
she
thought
the
bloodhounds
also
pursued
her
at
the
heels
already
and
a
sword
of
vengeance
to
mangle
her
body
this
fear
grew
so
powerful
upon
her
that
to
prevent
the
like
heavy
doom
from
falling
on
her
she
studied
and
therein
bestowed
all
the
night
season
how
to
change
her
hatred
into
kind
love
which
at
the
length
she
fully
obtained
and
then
purposed
to
procure
in
this
manner
secretly
she
sent
a
faithful
chambermaid
of
her
own
to
greet
anastasio
on
her
behalf
humbly
entreating
him
to
come
see
her
because
now
she
was
absolutely
determined
to
give
him
satisfaction
in
all
which
with
honour
he
could
request
of
her
whereto
anastasio
answered
that
he
accepted
her
message
thankfully
and
desired
no
other
favour
at
her
hand
but
that
which
stood
with
her
own
offer
namely
to
be
his
wife
in
honourable
marriage
the
maid
knowing
sufficiently
that
he
could
not
be
more
desirous
of
the
match
than
her
mistress
showed
herself
to
be
made
answer
in
her
name
that
this
motion
would
be
most
welcome
to
her
hereupon
the
gentlewoman
herself
became
the
solicitor
to
her
father
and
mother
telling
them
plainly
that
she
was
willing
to
be
the
wife
of
anastasio
which
news
did
so
highly
content
them
that
upon
the
sunday
next
following
the
marriage
was
very
worthily
solemnised
and
they
lived
and
loved
together
very
kindly
thus
the
divine
bounty
out
of
the
malignant
enemy
secret
machinations
can
cause
good
effects
to
arise
and
succeed
for
from
this
conceit
of
fearful
imagination
in
her
not
only
happened
this
conversion
of
a
maid
so
obstinately
scornful
and
proud
but
likewise
all
the
women
of
ravenna
being
admonished
by
her
example
grew
afterward
more
tractable
to
men
honest
motions
than
ever
they
showed
themselves
before
and
let
me
make
some
use
hereof
fair
ladies
to
you
not
to
stand
conceited
of
your
beauty
and
good
parts
when
men
solicit
you
with
their
best
services
remember
then
this
disdainful
gentlewoman
but
more
especially
her
who
being
the
death
of
so
kind
a
lover
was
therefore
condemned
to
perpetual
punishment
and
he
made
the
minister
thereof
whom
she
had
cast
off
with
coy
disdain
from
which
i
wish
your
minds
to
be
free
as
mine
is
ready
to
do
you
any
acceptable
service
v
teig
and
the
corpse
from
the
by
dr
douglas
hyde
there
was
once
a
lad
in
the
county
leitrim
and
he
was
strong
and
lively
and
the
son
of
a
rich
farmer
his
father
had
plenty
of
money
and
he
did
not
spare
it
on
the
son
accordingly
when
the
boy
grew
up
he
liked
sport
better
than
work
and
as
his
father
had
no
other
children
he
loved
this
one
so
much
that
he
allowed
him
to
do
in
everything
just
as
it
pleased
himself
he
was
very
extravagant
and
he
used
to
scatter
the
gold
money
as
another
person
would
scatter
the
white
he
was
seldom
to
be
found
at
home
but
if
there
was
a
fair
or
a
race
or
a
gathering
within
ten
miles
of
him
you
were
dead
certain
to
find
him
there
and
he
seldom
spent
a
night
in
his
father
house
but
he
used
to
be
always
out
rambling
and
like
shawn
bwee
long
ago
there
was
grádh
gach
cailin
i
mbrollach
a
léine
the
love
of
every
girl
in
the
breast
of
his
shirt
and
it
many
the
kiss
he
got
and
he
gave
for
he
was
very
handsome
and
there
was
a
girl
in
the
country
but
would
fall
in
love
with
him
only
for
him
to
fasten
his
two
eyes
on
her
and
it
was
for
that
someone
made
this
on
him
look
at
the
rogue
it
for
kisses
he
rambling
it
is
much
wonder
for
that
was
his
way
he
like
an
old
hedgehog
at
night
he
be
scrambling
from
this
place
to
that
but
he
sleep
in
the
day
at
last
he
became
very
wild
and
unruly
he
was
to
be
seen
day
or
night
in
his
father
house
but
always
rambling
or
going
on
his
night
visit
from
place
to
place
and
from
house
to
house
so
that
the
old
people
used
to
shake
their
heads
and
say
to
one
another
it
easy
seen
what
will
happen
to
the
land
when
the
old
man
dies
his
son
will
run
through
it
in
a
year
and
it
wo
stand
him
that
long
itself
he
used
to
be
always
gambling
and
and
drinking
but
his
father
never
minded
his
bad
habits
and
never
punished
him
but
it
happened
one
day
that
the
old
man
was
told
that
the
son
had
ruined
the
character
of
a
girl
in
the
neighbourhood
and
he
was
greatly
angry
and
he
called
the
son
to
him
and
said
to
him
quietly
and
sensibly
avic
says
he
you
know
i
loved
you
greatly
up
to
this
and
i
never
stopped
you
from
doing
your
choice
thing
whatever
it
was
and
i
kept
plenty
of
money
with
you
and
i
always
hoped
to
leave
you
the
house
and
land
and
all
i
had
after
myself
would
be
gone
but
i
heard
a
story
of
you
that
has
disgusted
me
with
you
i
can
not
tell
you
the
grief
that
i
felt
when
i
heard
such
a
thing
of
you
and
i
tell
you
now
plainly
that
unless
you
marry
that
girl
i
leave
house
and
land
and
everything
to
my
brother
son
i
never
could
leave
it
to
anyone
who
would
make
so
bad
a
use
of
it
as
you
do
yourself
deceiving
women
and
coaxing
girls
settle
with
yourself
now
whether
you
marry
that
girl
and
get
my
land
as
a
fortune
with
her
or
refuse
to
marry
her
and
give
up
all
that
was
coming
to
you
and
tell
me
in
the
morning
which
of
the
two
things
you
have
chosen
och
father
you
would
say
that
to
me
and
i
such
a
good
son
as
i
am
who
told
you
i
would
marry
the
girl
says
he
but
his
father
was
gone
and
the
lad
knew
well
enough
that
he
would
keep
his
word
too
and
he
was
greatly
troubled
in
his
mind
for
as
quiet
and
as
kind
as
the
father
was
he
never
went
back
of
a
word
that
he
had
once
said
and
there
was
another
man
in
the
country
who
was
harder
to
bend
than
he
was
the
boy
did
not
know
rightly
what
to
do
he
was
in
love
with
the
girl
indeed
and
he
hoped
to
marry
her
sometime
or
other
but
he
would
much
sooner
have
remained
another
while
as
he
was
and
follow
on
at
his
old
tricks
drinking
sporting
and
playing
cards
and
along
with
that
he
was
angry
that
his
father
should
order
him
to
marry
and
should
threaten
him
if
he
did
not
do
it
is
my
father
a
great
fool
says
he
to
himself
i
was
ready
enough
and
only
too
anxious
to
marry
mary
and
now
since
he
threatened
me
faith
i
a
great
mind
to
let
it
go
another
while
his
mind
was
so
much
excited
that
he
remained
between
two
notions
as
to
what
he
should
do
he
walked
out
into
the
night
at
last
to
cool
his
heated
blood
and
went
on
to
the
road
he
lit
a
pipe
and
as
the
night
was
fine
he
walked
and
walked
on
until
the
quick
pace
made
him
begin
to
forget
his
trouble
the
night
was
bright
and
the
moon
half
full
there
was
not
a
breath
of
wind
blowing
and
the
air
was
calm
and
mild
he
walked
on
for
nearly
three
hours
when
he
suddenly
remembered
that
it
was
late
in
the
night
and
time
for
him
to
turn
musha
i
think
i
forgot
myself
says
he
it
must
be
near
twelve
now
the
word
was
hardly
out
of
his
mouth
when
he
heard
the
sound
of
many
voices
and
the
trampling
of
feet
on
the
road
before
him
i
do
know
who
can
be
out
so
late
at
night
as
this
and
on
such
a
lonely
road
said
he
to
himself
he
stood
listening
and
he
heard
the
voices
of
many
people
talking
through
other
but
he
could
not
understand
what
they
were
saying
oh
wirra
says
he
i
afraid
it
not
irish
or
english
they
have
it
ca
be
they
frenchmen
he
went
on
a
couple
of
yards
further
and
he
saw
well
enough
by
the
light
of
the
moon
a
band
of
little
people
coming
towards
him
and
they
were
carrying
something
big
and
heavy
with
them
oh
murder
says
he
to
himself
sure
it
ca
be
that
the
good
people
that
in
it
every
of
hair
that
was
on
his
head
stood
up
and
there
fell
a
shaking
on
his
bones
for
he
saw
that
they
were
coming
to
him
fast
he
looked
at
them
again
and
perceived
that
there
were
about
twenty
little
men
in
it
and
there
was
not
a
man
at
all
of
them
higher
than
about
three
feet
or
three
feet
and
a
half
and
some
of
them
were
grey
and
seemed
very
old
he
looked
again
but
he
could
not
make
out
what
was
the
heavy
thing
they
were
carrying
until
they
came
up
to
him
and
then
they
all
stood
round
about
him
they
threw
the
heavy
thing
down
on
the
road
and
he
saw
on
the
spot
that
it
was
a
dead
body
he
became
as
cold
as
the
death
and
there
was
not
a
drop
of
blood
running
in
his
veins
when
an
old
little
grey
came
up
to
him
and
said
is
it
lucky
we
met
you
teig
poor
teig
could
not
bring
out
a
word
at
all
nor
open
his
lips
if
he
were
to
get
the
world
for
it
and
so
he
gave
no
answer
teig
said
the
little
grey
man
again
is
it
timely
you
met
us
teig
could
not
answer
him
teig
says
he
the
third
time
is
it
lucky
and
timely
that
we
met
you
but
teig
remained
silent
for
he
was
afraid
to
return
an
answer
and
his
tongue
was
as
if
it
was
tied
to
the
roof
of
his
mouth
the
little
grey
man
turned
to
his
companions
and
there
was
joy
in
his
bright
little
eye
and
now
says
he
teig
has
a
word
we
can
do
with
him
what
we
please
teig
teig
says
he
you
living
a
bad
life
and
we
can
make
a
slave
of
you
now
and
you
can
not
withstand
us
for
there
no
use
in
trying
to
go
against
us
lift
that
corpse
teig
was
so
frightened
that
he
was
only
able
to
utter
the
two
words
i
wo
for
as
frightened
as
he
was
he
was
obstinate
and
stiff
the
same
as
ever
teig
wo
lift
the
corpse
said
the
little
with
a
wicked
little
laugh
for
all
the
world
like
the
breaking
of
a
of
dry
and
with
a
little
harsh
voice
like
the
striking
of
a
cracked
bell
teig
wo
lift
the
corpse
make
him
lift
it
and
before
the
word
was
out
of
his
mouth
they
had
all
gathered
round
poor
teig
and
they
all
talking
and
laughing
through
other
teig
tried
to
run
from
them
but
they
followed
him
and
a
man
of
them
stretched
out
his
foot
before
him
as
he
ran
so
that
teig
was
thrown
in
a
heap
on
the
road
then
before
he
could
rise
up
the
fairies
caught
him
some
by
the
hands
and
some
by
the
feet
and
they
held
him
tight
in
a
way
that
he
could
not
stir
with
his
face
against
the
ground
six
or
seven
of
them
raised
the
body
then
and
pulled
it
over
to
him
and
left
it
down
on
his
back
the
breast
of
the
corpse
was
squeezed
against
teig
back
and
shoulders
and
the
arms
of
the
corpse
were
thrown
around
teig
neck
then
they
stood
back
from
him
a
couple
of
yards
and
let
him
get
up
he
rose
foaming
at
the
mouth
and
cursing
and
he
shook
himself
thinking
to
throw
the
corpse
off
his
back
but
his
fear
and
his
wonder
were
great
when
he
found
that
the
two
arms
had
a
tight
hold
round
his
own
neck
and
that
the
two
legs
were
squeezing
his
hips
firmly
and
that
however
strongly
he
tried
he
could
not
throw
it
off
any
more
than
a
horse
can
throw
off
its
saddle
he
was
terribly
frightened
then
and
he
thought
he
was
lost
ochone
for
ever
said
he
to
himself
it
the
bad
life
i
leading
that
has
given
the
good
people
this
power
over
me
i
promise
to
god
and
mary
peter
and
paul
patrick
and
bridget
that
i
mend
my
ways
for
as
long
as
i
have
to
live
if
i
come
clear
out
of
this
danger
and
i
marry
the
girl
the
little
grey
man
came
up
to
him
again
and
said
he
to
him
now
says
he
you
did
lift
the
body
when
i
told
you
to
lift
it
and
see
how
you
were
made
to
lift
it
perhaps
when
i
tell
you
to
bury
it
you
wo
bury
it
until
you
made
to
bury
it
anything
at
all
that
i
can
do
for
your
honour
said
teig
i
do
it
for
he
was
getting
sense
already
and
if
it
had
not
been
for
the
great
fear
that
was
on
him
he
never
would
have
let
that
civil
word
slip
out
of
his
mouth
the
little
man
laughed
a
sort
of
laugh
again
you
getting
quiet
now
teig
says
he
i
go
bail
but
you
be
quiet
enough
before
i
done
with
you
listen
to
me
now
teig
and
if
you
do
obey
me
in
all
i
telling
you
to
do
you
repent
it
you
must
carry
with
you
this
corpse
that
is
on
your
back
to
and
you
must
bring
it
into
the
church
with
you
and
make
a
grave
for
it
in
the
very
middle
of
the
church
and
you
must
raise
up
the
flags
and
put
them
down
again
the
very
same
way
and
you
must
carry
the
clay
out
of
the
church
and
leave
the
place
as
it
was
when
you
came
so
that
no
one
could
know
that
there
had
been
anything
changed
but
that
not
all
maybe
that
the
body
be
allowed
to
be
buried
in
that
church
perhaps
some
other
man
has
the
bed
and
if
so
it
likely
he
wo
share
it
with
this
one
if
you
do
get
leave
to
bury
it
in
you
must
carry
it
to
and
bury
it
in
the
churchyard
there
and
if
you
do
get
it
into
that
place
take
it
with
you
to
and
if
that
churchyard
is
closed
on
you
take
it
to
and
if
not
able
to
bury
it
there
you
no
more
to
do
than
to
take
it
to
and
you
can
bury
it
there
without
hindrance
i
can
not
tell
you
what
one
of
those
churches
is
the
one
where
you
will
have
leave
to
bury
that
corpse
under
the
clay
but
i
know
that
it
will
be
allowed
you
to
bury
him
at
some
church
or
other
of
them
if
you
do
this
work
rightly
we
will
be
thankful
to
you
and
you
will
have
no
cause
to
grieve
but
if
you
are
slow
or
lazy
believe
me
we
shall
take
satisfaction
of
you
when
the
grey
little
man
had
done
speaking
his
comrades
laughed
and
clapped
their
hands
together
glic
glic
hwee
hwee
they
all
cried
go
on
go
on
you
have
eight
hours
before
you
till
daybreak
and
if
you
have
this
man
buried
before
the
sun
rises
you
lost
they
struck
a
fist
and
a
foot
behind
on
him
and
drove
him
on
in
the
road
he
was
obliged
to
walk
and
to
walk
fast
for
they
gave
him
no
rest
he
thought
himself
that
there
was
not
a
wet
path
or
a
dirty
or
a
crooked
contrary
road
in
the
whole
county
that
he
had
not
walked
that
night
the
night
was
at
times
very
dark
and
whenever
there
would
come
a
cloud
across
the
moon
he
could
see
nothing
and
then
he
used
often
to
fall
sometimes
he
was
hurt
and
sometimes
he
escaped
but
he
was
obliged
always
to
rise
on
the
moment
and
to
hurry
on
sometimes
the
moon
would
break
out
clearly
and
then
he
would
look
behind
him
and
see
the
little
people
following
at
his
back
and
he
heard
them
speaking
amongst
themselves
talking
and
crying
out
and
screaming
like
a
flock
of
and
if
he
was
to
save
his
soul
he
never
understood
as
much
as
one
word
of
what
they
were
saying
he
did
not
know
how
far
he
had
walked
when
at
last
one
of
them
cried
out
to
him
stop
here
he
stood
and
they
all
gathered
round
him
do
you
see
those
withered
trees
over
there
says
the
old
boy
to
him
again
is
among
those
trees
and
you
must
go
in
there
by
yourself
for
we
can
not
follow
you
or
go
with
you
we
must
remain
here
go
on
boldly
teig
looked
from
him
and
he
saw
a
high
wall
that
was
in
places
half
broken
down
and
an
old
grey
church
on
the
inside
of
the
wall
and
about
a
dozen
withered
old
trees
scattered
here
and
there
round
it
there
was
neither
leaf
nor
twig
on
any
of
them
but
their
bare
crooked
branches
were
stretched
out
like
the
arms
of
an
angry
man
when
he
threatens
he
had
no
help
for
it
but
was
obliged
to
go
forward
he
was
a
couple
of
hundred
yards
from
the
church
but
he
walked
on
and
never
looked
behind
him
until
he
came
to
the
gate
of
the
churchyard
the
old
gate
was
thrown
down
and
he
had
no
difficulty
in
entering
he
turned
then
to
see
if
any
of
the
little
people
were
following
him
but
there
came
a
cloud
over
the
moon
and
the
night
became
so
dark
that
he
could
see
nothing
he
went
into
the
churchyard
and
he
walked
up
the
old
grassy
pathway
leading
to
the
church
when
he
reached
the
door
he
found
it
locked
the
door
was
large
and
strong
and
he
did
not
know
what
to
do
at
last
he
drew
out
his
knife
with
difficulty
and
stuck
it
in
the
wood
to
try
if
it
were
not
rotten
but
it
was
not
now
said
he
to
himself
i
have
no
more
to
do
the
door
is
shut
and
i
ca
open
it
before
the
words
were
rightly
shaped
in
his
own
mind
a
voice
in
his
ear
said
to
him
search
for
the
key
on
the
top
of
the
door
or
on
the
wall
he
started
who
is
that
speaking
to
me
he
cried
turning
round
but
he
saw
no
one
the
voice
said
in
his
ear
again
search
for
the
key
on
the
top
of
the
door
or
on
the
wall
what
that
said
he
and
the
sweat
running
from
his
forehead
who
spoke
to
me
it
i
the
corpse
that
spoke
to
you
said
the
voice
can
you
talk
said
teig
now
and
again
said
the
corpse
teig
searched
for
the
key
and
he
found
it
on
the
top
of
the
wall
he
was
too
much
frightened
to
say
any
more
but
he
opened
the
door
wide
and
as
quickly
as
he
could
and
he
went
in
with
the
corpse
on
his
back
it
was
as
dark
as
pitch
inside
and
poor
teig
began
to
shake
and
tremble
light
the
candle
said
the
corpse
teig
put
his
hand
in
his
pocket
as
well
as
he
was
able
and
drew
out
a
flint
and
steel
he
struck
a
spark
out
of
it
and
lit
a
burnt
rag
he
had
in
his
pocket
he
blew
it
until
it
made
a
flame
and
he
looked
round
him
the
church
was
very
ancient
and
part
of
the
wall
was
broken
down
the
windows
were
blown
in
or
cracked
and
the
timber
of
the
seats
were
rotten
there
were
six
or
seven
old
iron
candlesticks
left
there
still
and
in
one
of
these
candlesticks
teig
found
the
stump
of
an
old
candle
and
he
lit
it
he
was
still
looking
round
him
on
the
strange
and
horrid
place
in
which
he
found
himself
when
the
cold
corpse
whispered
in
his
ear
bury
me
now
bury
me
now
there
is
a
spade
and
turn
the
ground
teig
looked
from
him
and
he
saw
a
spade
lying
beside
the
altar
he
took
it
up
and
he
placed
the
blade
under
a
flag
that
was
in
the
middle
of
the
aisle
and
leaning
all
his
weight
on
the
handle
of
the
spade
he
raised
it
when
the
first
flag
was
raised
it
was
not
hard
to
raise
the
others
near
it
and
he
moved
three
or
four
of
them
out
of
their
places
the
clay
that
was
under
them
was
soft
and
easy
to
dig
but
he
had
not
thrown
up
more
than
three
or
four
shovelfuls
when
he
felt
the
iron
touch
something
soft
like
flesh
he
threw
up
three
or
four
more
shovelfuls
from
around
it
and
then
he
saw
that
it
was
another
body
that
was
buried
in
the
same
place
i
am
afraid
i
never
be
allowed
to
bury
the
two
bodies
in
the
same
hole
said
teig
in
his
own
mind
you
corpse
there
on
my
back
says
he
will
you
be
satisfied
if
i
bury
you
down
here
but
the
corpse
never
answered
him
a
word
that
a
good
sign
said
teig
to
himself
maybe
he
getting
quiet
and
he
thrust
the
spade
down
in
the
earth
again
perhaps
he
hurt
the
flesh
of
the
other
body
for
the
dead
man
that
was
buried
there
stood
up
in
the
grave
and
shouted
an
awful
shout
hoo
hoo
hoo
go
go
go
or
you
a
dead
dead
dead
man
and
then
he
fell
back
in
the
grave
again
teig
said
afterwards
that
of
all
the
wonderful
things
he
saw
that
night
that
was
the
most
awful
to
him
his
hair
stood
upright
on
his
head
like
the
bristles
of
a
pig
the
cold
sweat
ran
off
his
face
and
then
came
a
tremour
over
all
his
bones
until
he
thought
that
he
must
fall
but
after
a
while
he
became
bolder
when
he
saw
that
the
second
corpse
remained
lying
quietly
there
and
he
threw
in
the
clay
on
it
again
and
he
smoothed
it
overhead
and
he
laid
down
the
flags
carefully
as
they
had
been
before
it
ca
be
that
he
rise
up
any
more
said
he
he
went
down
the
aisle
a
little
further
and
drew
near
to
the
door
and
began
raising
the
flags
again
looking
for
another
bed
for
the
corpse
on
his
back
he
took
up
three
or
four
flags
and
put
them
aside
and
then
he
dug
the
clay
he
was
not
long
digging
until
he
laid
bare
an
old
woman
without
a
thread
upon
her
but
her
shirt
she
was
more
lively
than
the
first
corpse
for
he
had
scarcely
taken
any
of
the
clay
away
from
about
her
when
she
sat
up
and
began
to
cry
ho
you
clown
ha
you
where
has
he
been
that
he
got
no
bed
poor
teig
drew
back
and
when
she
found
that
she
was
getting
no
answer
she
closed
her
eyes
gently
lost
her
vigour
and
fell
back
quietly
and
slowly
under
the
clay
teig
did
to
her
as
he
had
done
to
the
man
he
threw
the
clay
back
on
her
and
left
the
flags
down
overhead
he
began
digging
again
near
the
door
but
before
he
had
thrown
up
more
than
a
couple
of
shovelfuls
he
noticed
a
man
hand
laid
bare
by
the
spade
by
my
soul
i
go
no
further
then
said
he
to
himself
what
use
is
it
for
me
and
he
threw
the
clay
in
again
on
it
and
settled
the
flags
as
they
had
been
before
he
left
the
church
then
and
his
heart
was
heavy
enough
but
he
shut
the
door
and
locked
it
and
left
the
key
where
he
found
it
he
sat
down
on
a
tombstone
that
was
near
the
door
and
began
thinking
he
was
in
great
doubt
what
he
should
do
he
laid
his
face
between
his
two
hands
and
cried
for
grief
and
fatigue
since
he
was
dead
certain
at
this
time
that
he
never
would
come
home
alive
he
made
another
attempt
to
loosen
the
hands
of
the
corpse
that
were
squeezed
round
his
neck
but
they
were
as
tight
as
if
they
were
clamped
and
the
more
he
tried
to
loosen
them
the
tighter
they
squeezed
him
he
was
going
to
sit
down
once
more
when
the
cold
horrid
lips
of
the
dead
man
said
to
him
and
he
remembered
the
command
of
the
good
people
to
bring
the
corpse
with
him
to
that
place
if
he
should
be
unable
to
bury
it
where
he
had
been
he
rose
up
and
looked
about
him
i
do
know
the
way
he
said
as
soon
as
he
had
uttered
the
word
the
corpse
stretched
out
suddenly
its
left
hand
that
had
been
tightened
round
his
neck
and
kept
it
pointing
out
showing
him
the
road
he
ought
to
follow
teig
went
in
the
direction
that
the
fingers
were
stretched
and
passed
out
of
the
churchyard
he
found
himself
on
an
old
rutty
stony
road
and
he
stood
still
again
not
knowing
where
to
turn
the
corpse
stretched
out
its
bony
hand
a
second
time
and
pointed
out
to
him
another
road
not
the
road
by
which
he
had
come
when
approaching
the
old
church
teig
followed
that
road
and
whenever
he
came
to
a
path
or
road
meeting
it
the
corpse
always
stretched
out
its
hand
and
pointed
with
its
fingers
showing
him
the
way
he
was
to
take
many
was
the
he
turned
down
and
many
was
the
crooked
he
walked
until
he
saw
from
him
an
old
at
last
beside
the
road
but
there
was
neither
church
nor
chapel
nor
any
other
building
in
it
the
corpse
squeezed
him
tightly
and
he
stood
bury
me
bury
me
in
the
said
the
voice
teig
drew
over
towards
the
old
and
he
was
not
more
than
about
twenty
yards
from
it
when
raising
his
eyes
he
saw
hundreds
and
hundreds
of
ghosts
men
women
and
children
sitting
on
the
top
of
the
wall
round
about
or
standing
on
the
inside
of
it
or
running
backwards
and
forwards
and
pointing
at
him
while
he
could
see
their
mouths
opening
and
shutting
as
if
they
were
speaking
though
he
heard
no
word
nor
any
sound
amongst
them
at
all
he
was
afraid
to
go
forward
so
he
stood
where
he
was
and
the
moment
he
stood
all
the
ghosts
became
quiet
and
ceased
moving
then
teig
understood
that
it
was
trying
to
keep
him
from
going
in
that
they
were
he
walked
a
couple
of
yards
forwards
and
immediately
the
whole
crowd
rushed
together
towards
the
spot
to
which
he
was
moving
and
they
stood
so
thickly
together
that
it
seemed
to
him
that
he
never
could
break
through
them
even
though
he
had
a
mind
to
try
but
he
had
no
mind
to
try
it
he
went
back
broken
and
dispirited
and
when
he
had
gone
a
couple
of
hundred
yards
from
the
he
stood
again
for
he
did
not
know
what
way
he
was
to
go
he
heard
the
voice
of
the
corpse
in
his
ear
saying
and
the
skinny
hand
was
stretched
out
again
pointing
him
out
the
road
as
tired
as
he
was
he
had
to
walk
and
the
road
was
neither
short
nor
even
the
night
was
darker
than
ever
and
it
was
difficult
to
make
his
way
many
was
the
toss
he
got
and
many
a
bruise
they
left
on
his
body
at
last
he
saw
from
him
in
the
distance
standing
in
the
middle
of
the
he
moved
over
towards
it
and
thought
he
was
all
right
and
safe
when
he
saw
no
ghosts
nor
anything
else
on
the
wall
and
he
thought
he
would
never
be
hindered
now
from
leaving
his
load
off
him
at
last
he
moved
over
to
the
gate
but
as
he
was
passing
in
he
tripped
on
the
threshold
before
he
could
recover
himself
something
that
he
could
not
see
seized
him
by
the
neck
by
the
hands
and
by
the
feet
and
bruised
him
and
shook
him
and
choked
him
until
he
was
nearly
dead
and
at
last
he
was
lifted
up
and
carried
more
than
a
hundred
yards
from
that
place
and
then
thrown
down
in
an
old
dyke
with
the
corpse
still
clinging
to
him
he
rose
up
bruised
and
sore
but
feared
to
go
near
the
place
again
for
he
had
seen
nothing
the
time
he
was
thrown
down
and
carried
away
you
corpse
up
on
my
back
said
he
shall
i
go
over
again
to
the
churchyard
but
the
corpse
never
answered
him
that
a
sign
you
do
wish
me
to
try
it
again
said
teig
he
was
now
in
great
doubt
as
to
what
he
ought
to
do
when
the
corpse
spoke
in
his
ear
and
said
oh
murder
said
teig
must
i
bring
you
there
if
you
keep
me
long
walking
like
this
i
tell
you
i
fall
under
you
he
went
on
however
in
the
direction
the
corpse
pointed
out
to
him
he
could
not
have
told
himself
how
long
he
had
been
going
when
the
dead
man
behind
suddenly
squeezed
him
and
said
there
teig
looked
from
him
and
he
saw
a
little
low
wall
that
was
so
broken
down
in
places
that
it
was
no
wall
at
all
it
was
in
a
great
wide
field
in
from
the
road
and
only
for
three
or
four
great
stones
at
the
corners
that
were
more
like
rocks
than
stones
there
was
nothing
to
show
that
there
was
either
graveyard
or
there
is
this
shall
i
bury
you
here
said
teig
yes
said
the
voice
but
i
see
no
grave
or
gravestone
only
this
pile
of
stones
said
teig
the
corpse
did
not
answer
but
stretched
out
its
long
fleshless
hand
to
show
teig
the
direction
in
which
he
was
to
go
teig
went
on
accordingly
but
he
was
greatly
terrified
for
he
remembered
what
had
happened
to
him
at
the
last
place
he
went
on
with
his
heart
in
his
mouth
as
he
said
himself
afterwards
but
when
he
came
to
within
fifteen
or
twenty
yards
of
the
little
low
square
wall
there
broke
out
a
flash
of
lightning
bright
yellow
and
red
with
blue
streaks
in
it
and
went
round
about
the
wall
in
one
course
and
it
swept
by
as
fast
as
the
swallow
in
the
clouds
and
the
longer
teig
remained
looking
at
it
the
faster
it
went
till
at
last
it
became
like
a
bright
ring
of
flame
round
the
old
graveyard
which
no
one
could
pass
without
being
burnt
by
it
teig
never
saw
from
the
time
he
was
born
and
never
saw
afterwards
so
wonderful
or
so
splendid
a
sight
as
that
was
round
went
the
flame
white
and
yellow
and
blue
sparks
leaping
out
from
it
as
it
went
and
although
at
first
it
had
been
no
more
than
a
thin
narrow
line
it
increased
slowly
until
it
was
at
last
a
great
broad
band
and
it
was
continually
getting
broader
and
higher
and
throwing
out
more
brilliant
sparks
till
there
was
never
a
colour
on
the
ridge
of
the
earth
that
was
not
to
be
seen
in
that
fire
and
lightning
never
shone
and
flame
never
flamed
that
was
so
shining
and
so
bright
as
that
teig
was
amazed
he
was
half
dead
with
fatigue
and
he
had
no
courage
left
to
approach
the
wall
there
fell
a
mist
over
his
eyes
and
there
came
a
in
his
head
and
he
was
obliged
to
sit
down
upon
a
great
stone
to
recover
himself
he
could
see
nothing
but
the
light
and
he
could
hear
nothing
but
the
whirr
of
it
as
it
shot
round
the
paddock
faster
than
a
flash
of
lightning
as
he
sat
there
on
the
stone
the
voice
whispered
once
more
in
his
ear
and
the
dead
man
squeezed
him
so
tightly
that
he
cried
out
he
rose
again
sick
tired
and
trembling
and
went
forward
as
he
was
directed
the
wind
was
cold
and
the
road
was
bad
and
the
load
upon
his
back
was
heavy
and
the
night
was
dark
and
he
himself
was
nearly
worn
out
and
if
he
had
had
very
much
farther
to
go
he
must
have
fallen
dead
under
his
burden
at
last
the
corpse
stretched
out
its
hand
and
said
to
him
bury
me
there
this
is
the
last
said
teig
in
his
own
mind
and
the
little
grey
man
said
i
be
allowed
to
bury
him
in
some
of
them
so
it
must
be
this
it
ca
be
but
they
let
him
in
here
the
first
faint
streak
of
the
of
was
appearing
in
the
east
and
the
clouds
were
beginning
to
catch
fire
but
it
was
darker
than
ever
for
the
moon
was
set
and
there
were
no
stars
make
haste
make
haste
said
the
corpse
and
teig
hurried
forward
as
well
as
he
could
to
the
graveyard
which
was
a
little
place
on
a
bare
hill
with
only
a
few
graves
in
it
he
walked
boldly
in
through
the
open
gate
and
nothing
touched
him
nor
did
he
either
hear
or
see
anything
he
came
to
the
middle
of
the
ground
and
then
stood
up
and
looked
round
him
for
a
spade
or
shovel
to
make
a
grave
as
he
was
turning
round
and
searching
he
suddenly
perceived
what
startled
him
greatly
a
grave
right
before
him
he
moved
over
to
it
and
looked
down
and
there
at
the
bottom
he
saw
a
black
coffin
he
clambered
down
into
the
hole
and
lifted
the
lid
and
found
that
as
he
thought
it
would
be
the
coffin
was
empty
he
had
hardly
mounted
up
out
of
the
hole
and
was
standing
on
the
brink
when
the
corpse
which
had
clung
to
him
for
more
than
eight
hours
suddenly
relaxed
its
hold
of
his
neck
and
loosened
its
shins
from
round
his
hips
and
sank
down
with
a
into
the
open
coffin
teig
fell
down
on
his
two
knees
at
the
brink
of
the
grave
and
gave
thanks
to
god
he
made
no
delay
then
but
pressed
down
the
coffin
lid
in
its
place
and
threw
in
the
clay
over
it
with
his
two
hands
and
when
the
grave
was
filled
up
he
stamped
and
leaped
on
it
with
his
feet
until
it
was
firm
and
hard
and
then
he
left
the
place
the
sun
was
fast
rising
as
he
finished
his
work
and
the
first
thing
he
did
was
to
return
to
the
road
and
look
out
for
a
house
to
rest
himself
in
he
found
an
inn
at
last
and
lay
down
upon
a
bed
there
and
slept
till
night
then
he
rose
up
and
ate
a
little
and
fell
asleep
again
till
morning
when
he
awoke
in
the
morning
he
hired
a
horse
and
rode
home
he
was
more
than
miles
from
home
where
he
was
and
he
had
come
all
that
way
with
the
dead
body
on
his
back
in
one
night
all
the
people
at
his
own
home
thought
that
he
must
have
left
the
country
and
they
rejoiced
greatly
when
they
saw
him
come
back
everyone
began
asking
him
where
he
had
been
but
he
would
not
tell
anyone
except
his
father
he
was
a
changed
man
from
that
day
he
never
drank
too
much
he
never
lost
his
money
over
cards
and
especially
he
would
not
take
the
world
and
be
out
late
by
himself
of
a
dark
night
he
was
not
a
fortnight
at
home
until
he
married
mary
the
girl
he
had
been
in
love
with
and
it
at
their
wedding
the
sport
was
and
it
he
was
the
happy
man
from
that
day
forward
and
it
all
i
wish
that
we
may
be
as
happy
as
he
was
a
stanza
a
visit
in
the
evening
oh
mary
an
exclamation
like
the
french
a
single
hair
in
irish
a
bundle
or
wisp
or
a
little
share
of
anything
a
rod
or
twig
a
lane
a
clown
vertigo
son
or
rather
oh
son
mic
is
the
vocative
of
mac
vi
the
haunted
and
the
haunters
or
the
house
and
the
brain
by
sir
edward
a
friend
of
mine
who
is
a
man
of
letters
and
a
philosopher
said
to
me
one
day
as
if
between
jest
and
earnest
fancy
since
we
last
met
i
have
discovered
a
haunted
house
in
the
midst
of
london
really
haunted
and
by
what
ghosts
well
i
ca
answer
these
questions
all
i
know
is
this
six
weeks
ago
i
and
my
wife
were
in
search
of
a
furnished
apartment
passing
a
quiet
street
we
saw
on
the
window
of
one
of
the
houses
a
bill
furnished
the
situation
suited
us
we
entered
the
house
liked
the
rooms
engaged
them
by
the
week
and
left
them
the
third
day
no
power
on
earth
could
have
reconciled
my
wife
to
stay
longer
and
i
wonder
at
it
what
did
you
see
excuse
me
i
have
no
desire
to
be
ridiculed
as
a
superstitious
dreamer
nor
on
the
other
hand
could
i
ask
you
to
accept
on
my
affirmation
what
you
would
hold
to
be
incredible
without
the
evidence
of
your
own
senses
let
me
only
say
this
it
was
not
so
much
what
we
saw
or
heard
in
which
you
might
fairly
suppose
that
we
were
the
dupes
of
our
own
excited
fancy
or
the
victims
of
imposture
in
others
that
drove
us
away
as
it
was
an
undefinable
terror
which
seized
both
of
us
whenever
we
passed
by
the
door
of
a
certain
unfurnished
room
in
which
we
neither
saw
nor
heard
anything
and
the
strangest
marvel
of
all
was
that
for
once
in
my
life
i
agreed
with
my
wife
silly
woman
though
she
be
and
allowed
after
the
third
night
that
it
was
impossible
to
stay
a
fourth
in
that
house
accordingly
on
the
fourth
morning
i
summoned
the
woman
who
kept
the
house
and
attended
on
us
and
told
her
that
the
rooms
did
not
quite
suit
us
and
we
would
not
stay
out
our
week
she
said
dryly
know
why
you
have
stayed
longer
than
any
other
lodger
few
ever
stayed
a
second
night
none
before
you
a
third
but
i
take
it
they
have
been
very
kind
to
you
who
i
asked
affecting
a
smile
they
who
haunt
the
house
whoever
they
are
i
do
mind
them
i
remember
them
many
years
ago
when
i
lived
in
this
house
not
as
a
servant
but
i
know
they
will
be
the
death
of
me
some
day
i
care
i
old
and
must
die
soon
anyhow
and
then
i
shall
be
with
them
and
in
this
house
still
the
woman
spoke
with
so
dreary
a
calmness
that
really
it
was
a
sort
of
awe
that
prevented
my
conversing
with
her
farther
i
paid
for
my
week
and
too
happy
were
i
and
my
wife
to
get
off
so
cheaply
you
excite
my
curiosity
said
i
nothing
i
should
like
better
than
to
sleep
in
a
haunted
house
pray
give
me
the
address
of
the
one
which
you
left
so
ignominiously
my
friend
gave
me
the
address
and
when
we
parted
i
walked
straight
towards
the
house
thus
indicated
it
is
situated
on
the
north
side
of
oxford
street
in
a
dull
but
respectable
thoroughfare
i
found
the
house
shut
up
no
bill
at
the
window
and
no
response
to
my
knock
as
i
was
turning
away
a
collecting
pewter
pots
at
the
neighbouring
areas
said
to
me
do
you
want
anyone
in
that
house
sir
yes
i
heard
it
was
to
let
let
why
the
woman
who
kept
it
is
dead
has
been
dead
these
three
weeks
and
no
one
can
be
found
to
stay
there
though
mr
j
offered
ever
so
much
he
offered
mother
who
chars
for
him
a
week
just
to
open
and
shut
the
windows
and
she
would
not
would
not
and
why
the
house
is
haunted
and
the
old
woman
who
kept
it
was
found
dead
in
her
bed
with
her
eyes
wide
open
they
say
the
devil
strangled
her
pooh
you
speak
of
mr
j
is
he
the
owner
of
the
house
yes
where
does
he
live
in
g
street
no
what
is
he
in
any
business
no
sir
nothing
particular
a
single
gentleman
i
gave
the
the
gratuity
earned
by
his
liberal
information
and
proceeded
to
mr
j
in
g
street
which
was
close
by
the
street
that
boasted
the
haunted
house
i
was
lucky
enough
to
find
mr
j
at
home
an
elderly
man
with
intelligent
countenance
and
prepossessing
manners
i
communicated
my
name
and
my
business
frankly
i
said
i
heard
the
house
was
considered
to
be
haunted
that
i
had
a
strong
desire
to
examine
a
house
with
so
equivocal
a
reputation
that
i
should
be
greatly
obliged
if
he
would
allow
me
to
hire
it
though
only
for
a
night
i
was
willing
to
pay
for
that
privilege
whatever
he
might
be
inclined
to
ask
sir
said
mr
j
with
great
courtesy
the
house
is
at
your
service
for
as
short
or
as
long
a
time
as
you
please
rent
is
out
of
the
question
the
obligation
will
be
on
my
side
should
you
be
able
to
discover
the
cause
of
the
strange
phenomena
which
at
present
deprive
it
of
all
value
i
can
not
let
it
for
i
can
not
even
get
a
servant
to
keep
it
in
order
or
answer
the
door
unluckily
the
house
is
haunted
if
i
may
use
that
expression
not
only
by
night
but
by
day
though
at
night
the
disturbances
are
of
a
more
unpleasant
and
sometimes
of
a
more
alarming
character
the
poor
old
woman
who
died
in
it
three
weeks
ago
was
a
pauper
whom
i
took
out
of
a
workhouse
for
in
her
childhood
she
had
been
known
to
some
of
my
family
and
had
once
been
in
such
good
circumstances
that
she
had
rented
that
house
of
my
uncle
she
was
a
woman
of
superior
education
and
strong
mind
and
was
the
only
person
i
could
ever
induce
to
remain
in
the
house
indeed
since
her
death
which
was
sudden
and
the
inquest
which
gave
it
a
notoriety
in
the
neighbourhood
i
have
so
despaired
of
finding
any
person
to
take
charge
of
it
much
more
a
tenant
that
i
would
willingly
let
it
rent
free
for
a
year
to
anyone
who
would
pay
its
rates
and
taxes
how
long
is
it
since
the
house
acquired
this
sinister
character
that
i
can
scarcely
tell
you
but
very
many
years
since
the
old
woman
i
spoke
of
said
it
was
haunted
when
she
rented
it
between
thirty
and
forty
years
ago
the
fact
is
that
my
life
has
been
spent
in
the
east
indies
and
in
the
civil
service
of
the
company
i
returned
to
england
last
year
on
inheriting
the
fortune
of
an
uncle
amongst
whose
possessions
was
the
house
in
question
i
found
it
shut
up
and
uninhabited
i
was
told
that
it
was
haunted
that
no
one
would
inhabit
it
i
smiled
at
what
seemed
to
me
so
idle
a
story
i
spent
some
money
in
repainting
and
roofing
it
added
to
its
furniture
a
few
modern
articles
advertised
it
and
obtained
a
lodger
for
a
year
he
was
a
colonel
retired
on
he
came
in
with
his
family
a
son
and
a
daughter
and
four
or
five
servants
they
all
left
the
house
the
next
day
and
although
they
deponed
that
they
had
all
seen
something
different
that
something
was
equally
terrible
to
all
i
really
could
not
in
conscience
sue
or
even
blame
the
colonel
for
breach
of
agreement
then
i
put
in
the
old
woman
i
have
spoken
of
and
she
was
empowered
to
let
the
house
in
apartments
i
never
had
one
lodger
who
stayed
more
than
three
days
i
do
not
tell
you
their
stories
to
no
two
lodgers
have
there
been
exactly
the
same
phenomena
repeated
it
is
better
that
you
should
judge
for
yourself
than
enter
the
house
with
an
imagination
influenced
by
previous
narratives
only
be
prepared
to
see
and
to
hear
something
or
other
and
take
whatever
precautions
you
yourself
please
have
you
never
had
a
curiosity
yourself
to
pass
a
night
in
that
house
yes
i
passed
not
a
night
but
three
hours
in
broad
daylight
alone
in
that
house
my
curiosity
is
not
satisfied
but
it
is
quenched
i
have
no
desire
to
renew
the
experiment
you
can
not
complain
you
see
sir
that
i
am
not
sufficiently
candid
and
unless
your
interest
be
exceedingly
eager
and
your
nerves
unusually
strong
i
honestly
add
that
i
advise
you
to
pass
a
night
in
that
house
my
interest
exceedingly
keen
said
i
and
though
only
a
coward
will
boast
of
his
nerves
in
situations
wholly
unfamiliar
to
him
yet
my
nerves
have
been
seasoned
in
such
variety
of
danger
that
i
have
the
right
to
rely
on
them
even
in
a
haunted
house
mr
j
said
very
little
more
he
took
the
keys
of
the
house
out
of
his
bureau
gave
them
to
me
and
thanking
him
cordially
for
his
frankness
and
his
urbane
concession
to
my
wish
i
carried
off
my
prize
impatient
for
the
experiment
as
soon
as
i
reached
home
i
summoned
my
confidential
servant
a
young
man
of
gay
spirits
fearless
temper
and
as
free
from
superstitious
prejudice
as
anyone
i
could
think
of
f
said
i
you
remember
in
germany
how
disappointed
we
were
at
not
finding
a
ghost
in
that
old
castle
which
was
said
to
be
haunted
by
a
headless
apparition
well
i
have
heard
of
a
house
in
london
which
i
have
reason
to
hope
is
decidedly
haunted
i
mean
to
sleep
there
from
what
i
hear
there
is
no
doubt
that
something
will
allow
itself
to
be
seen
or
to
be
heard
something
perhaps
excessively
horrible
do
you
think
if
i
take
you
with
me
i
may
rely
on
your
presence
of
mind
whatever
may
happen
oh
sir
pray
trust
me
answered
f
grinning
with
delight
very
well
then
here
are
the
keys
of
the
house
this
is
the
address
go
now
select
for
me
any
bedroom
you
please
and
since
the
house
has
not
been
inhabited
for
weeks
make
up
a
good
fire
air
the
bed
well
see
of
course
that
there
are
candles
as
well
as
fuel
take
with
you
my
revolver
and
my
dagger
so
much
for
my
weapons
arm
yourself
equally
well
and
if
we
are
not
a
match
for
a
dozen
ghosts
we
shall
be
but
a
sorry
couple
of
englishmen
i
was
engaged
for
the
rest
of
the
day
on
business
so
urgent
that
i
had
not
leisure
to
think
much
on
the
nocturnal
adventure
to
which
i
had
plighted
my
honour
i
dined
alone
and
very
late
and
while
dining
read
as
is
my
habit
the
volume
i
selected
was
one
of
essays
i
thought
to
myself
that
i
would
take
the
book
with
me
there
was
so
much
of
healthfulness
in
the
style
and
practical
life
in
the
subjects
that
it
would
serve
as
an
antidote
against
the
influences
of
superstitious
fancy
accordingly
about
nine
i
put
the
book
into
my
pocket
and
strolled
leisurely
towards
the
haunted
house
i
took
with
me
a
favourite
dog
an
exceedingly
sharp
bold
and
vigilant
a
dog
fond
of
prowling
about
strange
ghostly
corners
and
passages
at
night
in
search
of
rats
a
dog
of
dogs
for
a
ghost
it
was
a
summer
night
but
chilly
the
sky
somewhat
gloomy
and
overcast
still
there
was
a
moon
faint
and
sickly
but
still
a
moon
and
if
the
clouds
permitted
after
midnight
it
would
be
brighter
i
reached
the
house
knocked
and
my
servant
opened
with
a
cheerful
smile
all
right
sir
and
very
comfortable
oh
said
i
rather
disappointed
have
you
not
seen
nor
heard
anything
remarkable
well
sir
i
must
own
i
have
heard
something
queer
what
what
the
sound
of
feet
pattering
behind
me
and
once
or
twice
small
noises
like
whispers
close
at
my
ear
nothing
more
you
are
not
at
all
frightened
i
not
a
bit
of
it
sir
and
the
man
bold
look
reassured
me
on
one
point
viz
that
happen
what
might
he
would
not
desert
me
we
were
in
the
hall
the
closed
and
my
attention
was
now
drawn
to
my
dog
he
had
at
first
ran
in
eagerly
enough
but
had
sneaked
back
to
the
door
and
was
scratching
and
whining
to
get
out
after
patting
him
on
the
head
and
encouraging
him
gently
the
dog
seemed
to
reconcile
himself
to
the
situation
and
followed
me
and
f
through
the
house
but
keeping
close
at
my
heels
instead
of
hurrying
inquisitively
in
advance
which
was
his
usual
and
normal
habit
in
all
strange
places
we
first
visited
the
subterranean
apartments
the
kitchen
and
other
offices
and
especially
the
cellars
in
which
last
there
were
two
or
three
bottles
of
wine
still
left
in
a
bin
covered
with
cobwebs
and
evidently
by
their
appearance
undisturbed
for
many
years
it
was
clear
that
the
ghosts
were
not
for
the
rest
we
discovered
nothing
of
interest
there
was
a
gloomy
little
backyard
with
very
high
walls
the
stones
of
this
yard
were
very
damp
and
what
with
the
damp
and
what
with
the
dust
and
on
the
pavement
our
feet
left
a
slight
impression
where
we
passed
and
now
appeared
the
first
strange
phenomenon
witnessed
by
myself
in
this
strange
abode
i
saw
just
before
me
the
print
of
a
foot
suddenly
form
itself
as
it
were
i
stopped
caught
hold
of
my
servant
and
pointed
to
it
in
advance
of
that
footprint
as
suddenly
dropped
another
we
both
saw
it
i
advanced
quickly
to
the
place
the
footprint
kept
advancing
before
me
a
small
footprint
the
foot
of
a
child
the
impression
was
too
faint
thoroughly
to
distinguish
the
shape
but
it
seemed
to
us
both
that
it
was
the
print
of
a
naked
foot
this
phenomenon
ceased
when
we
arrived
at
the
opposite
wall
nor
did
it
repeat
itself
on
returning
we
remounted
the
stairs
and
entered
the
rooms
on
the
ground
floor
a
dining
parlour
a
small
and
a
still
smaller
third
room
that
had
been
probably
appropriated
to
a
footman
all
still
as
death
we
then
visited
the
which
seemed
fresh
and
new
in
the
front
room
i
seated
myself
in
an
armchair
f
placed
on
the
table
the
candlestick
with
which
he
had
lighted
us
i
told
him
to
shut
the
door
as
he
turned
to
do
so
a
chair
opposite
to
me
moved
from
the
wall
quickly
and
noiselessly
and
dropped
itself
about
a
yard
from
my
own
chair
immediately
fronting
it
why
this
is
better
than
the
said
i
with
a
and
as
i
laughed
my
dog
put
back
his
head
and
howled
f
coming
back
had
not
observed
the
movement
of
the
chair
he
employed
himself
now
in
stilling
the
dog
i
continued
to
gaze
on
the
chair
and
fancied
i
saw
on
it
a
pale
blue
misty
outline
of
a
human
figure
but
an
outline
so
indistinct
that
i
could
only
distrust
my
own
vision
the
dog
now
was
quiet
put
back
that
chair
opposite
to
me
said
i
to
f
put
it
back
to
the
wall
f
obeyed
was
that
you
sir
said
he
turning
abruptly
i
what
why
something
struck
me
i
felt
it
sharply
on
the
shoulder
just
here
no
said
i
but
we
have
jugglers
present
and
though
we
may
not
discover
their
tricks
we
shall
catch
before
they
frighten
we
did
not
stay
long
in
the
in
fact
they
felt
so
damp
and
so
chilly
that
i
was
glad
to
get
to
the
fire
upstairs
we
locked
the
doors
of
the
a
precaution
which
i
should
observe
we
had
taken
with
all
the
rooms
we
had
searched
below
the
bedroom
my
servant
had
selected
for
me
was
the
best
on
the
floor
a
large
one
with
two
windows
fronting
the
street
the
bed
which
took
up
no
inconsiderable
space
was
opposite
to
the
fire
which
burned
clear
and
bright
a
door
in
the
wall
to
the
left
between
the
bed
and
the
window
communicated
with
the
room
which
my
servant
appropriated
to
himself
this
last
was
a
small
room
with
a
and
had
no
communication
with
the
no
other
door
but
that
which
conducted
to
the
bedroom
i
was
to
occupy
on
either
side
of
my
fireplace
was
a
cupboard
without
locks
flushed
with
the
wall
and
covered
with
the
same
paper
we
examined
these
cupboards
only
hooks
to
suspend
female
dresses
nothing
else
we
sounded
the
walls
evidently
solid
the
outer
walls
of
the
building
having
finished
the
survey
of
these
apartments
warmed
myself
a
few
moments
and
lighted
my
cigar
i
then
still
accompanied
by
f
went
forth
to
complete
my
reconnoitre
in
the
there
was
another
door
it
was
closed
firmly
sir
said
my
servant
in
surprise
i
unlocked
this
door
with
all
the
others
when
i
first
came
it
can
not
have
got
locked
from
the
inside
for
it
is
a
before
he
had
finished
his
sentence
the
door
which
neither
of
us
then
was
touching
opened
quietly
of
itself
we
looked
at
each
other
a
single
instant
the
same
thought
seized
both
some
human
agency
might
be
detected
here
i
rushed
in
first
my
servant
followed
a
small
blank
dreary
room
without
furniture
a
few
empty
boxes
and
hampers
in
a
corner
a
small
window
the
shutters
closed
not
even
a
fireplace
no
other
door
but
that
by
which
we
had
entered
no
carpet
on
the
floor
and
the
floor
seemed
very
old
uneven
mended
here
and
there
as
was
shown
by
the
whiter
patches
on
the
wood
but
no
living
being
and
no
visible
place
in
which
a
living
being
could
have
hidden
as
we
stood
gazing
around
the
door
by
which
we
had
entered
closed
as
quietly
as
it
had
before
opened
we
were
imprisoned
for
the
first
time
i
felt
a
creep
of
undefinable
horror
not
so
my
servant
why
they
do
think
to
trap
us
sir
i
could
break
that
trumpery
door
with
a
kick
of
my
foot
try
first
if
it
will
open
to
your
hand
said
i
shaking
off
the
vague
apprehension
that
had
seized
me
while
i
open
the
shutters
and
see
what
is
without
i
unbarred
the
shutters
the
window
looked
on
the
little
backyard
i
have
before
described
there
was
no
ledge
without
nothing
but
sheer
descent
no
man
getting
out
of
that
window
would
have
found
any
footing
till
he
had
fallen
on
the
stones
below
f
meanwhile
was
vainly
attempting
to
open
the
door
he
now
turned
round
to
me
and
asked
my
permission
to
use
force
and
i
should
here
state
in
justice
to
the
servant
that
far
from
evincing
any
superstitious
terrors
his
nerve
composure
and
even
gaiety
amidst
circumstances
so
extraordinary
compelled
my
admiration
and
made
me
congratulate
myself
on
having
secured
a
companion
in
every
way
fitted
to
the
occasion
i
willingly
gave
him
the
permission
he
required
but
though
he
was
a
remarkably
strong
man
his
force
was
as
idle
as
his
milder
efforts
the
door
did
not
even
shake
to
his
stoutest
kick
breathless
and
panting
he
desisted
i
then
tried
the
door
myself
equally
in
vain
as
i
ceased
from
the
effort
again
that
creep
of
horror
came
over
me
but
this
time
it
was
more
cold
and
stubborn
i
felt
as
if
some
strange
and
ghastly
exhalation
were
rising
up
from
the
chinks
of
that
rugged
floor
and
filling
the
atmosphere
with
a
venomous
influence
hostile
to
human
life
the
door
now
very
slowly
and
quietly
opened
as
of
its
own
accord
we
precipitated
ourselves
into
the
we
both
saw
a
large
pale
light
as
large
as
the
human
figure
but
shapeless
and
unsubstantial
move
before
us
and
ascend
the
stairs
that
led
from
the
landing
into
the
attics
i
followed
the
light
and
my
servant
followed
me
it
entered
to
the
right
of
the
landing
a
small
garret
of
which
the
door
stood
open
i
entered
in
the
same
instant
the
light
then
collapsed
into
a
small
globule
exceedingly
brilliant
and
vivid
rested
a
moment
on
a
bed
in
the
corner
quivered
and
vanished
we
approached
the
bed
and
examined
it
a
such
as
is
commonly
found
in
attics
devoted
to
servants
on
the
drawers
that
stood
near
it
we
perceived
an
old
faded
silk
kerchief
with
the
needle
still
left
in
a
rent
half
repaired
the
kerchief
was
covered
with
dust
probably
it
had
belonged
to
the
old
woman
who
had
last
died
in
that
house
and
this
might
have
been
her
i
had
sufficient
curiosity
to
open
the
drawers
there
were
a
few
odds
and
ends
of
female
dress
and
two
letters
tied
round
with
a
narrow
ribbon
of
faded
yellow
i
took
the
liberty
to
possess
myself
of
the
letters
we
found
nothing
else
in
the
room
worth
noticing
nor
did
the
light
reappear
but
we
distinctly
heard
as
we
turned
to
go
a
pattering
footfall
on
the
floor
just
before
us
we
went
through
the
other
attics
in
all
four
the
footfall
still
preceding
us
nothing
to
be
seen
nothing
but
the
footfall
heard
i
had
the
letters
in
my
hand
just
as
i
was
descending
the
stairs
i
distinctly
felt
my
wrist
seized
and
a
faint
soft
effort
made
to
draw
the
letters
from
my
clasp
i
only
held
them
the
more
tightly
and
the
effort
ceased
we
regained
the
bedchamber
appropriated
to
myself
and
i
then
remarked
that
my
dog
had
not
followed
us
when
we
had
left
it
he
was
thrusting
himself
close
to
the
fire
and
trembling
i
was
impatient
to
examine
the
letters
and
while
i
read
them
my
servant
opened
a
little
box
in
which
he
had
deposited
the
weapons
i
had
ordered
him
to
bring
took
them
out
placed
them
on
a
table
close
at
my
and
then
occupied
himself
in
soothing
the
dog
who
however
seemed
to
heed
him
very
little
the
letters
were
short
they
were
dated
the
dates
exactly
years
ago
they
were
evidently
from
a
lover
to
his
mistress
or
a
husband
to
some
young
wife
not
only
the
terms
of
expression
but
a
distinct
reference
to
a
former
voyage
indicated
the
writer
to
have
been
a
seafarer
the
spelling
and
handwriting
were
those
of
a
man
imperfectly
educated
but
still
the
language
itself
was
forcible
in
the
expressions
of
endearment
there
was
a
kind
of
rough
wild
love
but
here
and
there
were
dark
unintelligible
hints
at
some
secret
not
of
love
some
secret
that
seemed
of
crime
we
ought
to
love
each
other
was
one
of
the
sentences
i
remember
for
how
everyone
else
would
execrate
us
if
all
was
known
again
do
let
anyone
be
in
the
same
room
with
you
at
night
you
talk
in
your
sleep
and
again
what
done
ca
be
undone
and
i
tell
you
there
nothing
against
us
unless
the
dead
could
come
to
life
here
there
was
underlined
in
a
better
handwriting
a
female
they
do
at
the
end
of
the
letter
latest
in
date
the
same
female
hand
had
written
these
words
lost
at
sea
the
of
june
the
same
day
as
i
put
down
the
letters
and
began
to
muse
over
their
contents
fearing
however
that
the
train
of
thought
into
which
i
fell
might
unsteady
my
nerves
i
fully
determined
to
keep
my
mind
in
a
fit
state
to
cope
with
whatever
of
marvellous
the
advancing
night
might
bring
forth
i
roused
myself
laid
the
letters
on
the
table
stirred
up
the
fire
which
was
still
bright
and
cheering
and
opened
my
volume
of
macaulay
i
read
quietly
enough
till
about
eleven
i
then
threw
myself
dressed
upon
the
bed
and
told
my
servant
he
might
retire
to
his
own
room
but
must
keep
himself
awake
i
bade
him
leave
open
the
door
between
the
two
rooms
thus
alone
i
kept
two
candles
burning
on
the
table
by
my
i
placed
my
watch
beside
the
weapons
and
calmly
resumed
my
macaulay
opposite
to
me
the
fire
burned
clear
and
on
the
seemingly
asleep
lay
the
dog
in
about
twenty
minutes
i
felt
an
exceedingly
cold
air
pass
by
my
cheek
like
a
sudden
draught
i
fancied
the
door
to
my
right
communicating
with
the
must
have
got
open
but
no
it
was
closed
i
then
turned
my
glance
to
my
left
and
saw
the
flame
of
the
candles
violently
swayed
as
by
a
wind
at
the
same
moment
the
watch
beside
the
revolver
softly
slid
from
the
table
softly
softly
no
visible
hand
it
was
gone
i
sprang
up
seizing
the
revolver
with
the
one
hand
the
dagger
with
the
other
i
was
not
willing
that
my
weapons
should
share
the
fate
of
the
watch
thus
armed
i
looked
round
the
floor
no
sign
of
the
watch
three
slow
loud
distinct
knocks
were
now
heard
at
the
my
servant
called
out
is
that
you
sir
no
be
on
your
guard
the
dog
now
roused
himself
and
sat
on
his
haunches
his
ears
moving
quickly
backwards
and
forwards
he
kept
his
eyes
fixed
on
me
with
a
look
so
strange
that
he
concentrated
all
my
attention
on
himself
slowly
he
rose
up
all
his
hair
bristling
and
stood
perfectly
rigid
and
with
the
same
wild
stare
i
had
no
time
however
to
examine
the
dog
presently
my
servant
emerged
from
his
room
and
if
ever
i
saw
horror
in
the
human
face
it
was
then
i
should
not
have
recognised
him
had
we
met
in
the
streets
so
altered
was
every
lineament
he
passed
by
me
quickly
saying
in
a
whisper
that
seemed
scarcely
to
come
from
his
lips
run
run
it
is
after
me
he
gained
the
door
to
the
landing
pulled
it
open
and
rushed
forth
i
followed
him
into
the
landing
involuntarily
calling
him
to
stop
but
without
heeding
me
he
bounded
down
the
stairs
clinging
to
the
balusters
and
taking
several
steps
at
a
time
i
heard
where
i
stood
the
street
door
open
heard
it
again
clap
to
i
was
left
alone
in
the
haunted
house
it
was
but
for
a
moment
that
i
remained
undecided
whether
or
not
to
follow
my
servant
pride
and
curiosity
alike
forbade
so
dastardly
a
flight
i
my
room
closing
the
door
after
me
and
proceeded
cautiously
into
the
interior
chamber
i
encountered
nothing
to
justify
my
servant
terror
i
again
carefully
examined
the
walls
to
see
if
there
were
any
concealed
door
i
could
find
no
trace
of
one
not
even
a
seam
in
the
paper
with
which
the
room
was
hung
how
then
had
the
thing
whatever
it
was
which
had
so
scared
him
obtained
ingress
except
through
my
own
chamber
i
returned
to
my
room
shut
and
locked
the
door
that
opened
upon
the
interior
one
and
stood
on
the
hearth
expectant
and
prepared
i
now
perceived
that
the
dog
had
slunk
into
an
angle
of
the
wall
and
was
pressing
himself
close
against
it
as
if
literally
trying
to
force
his
way
into
it
i
approached
the
animal
and
spoke
to
it
the
poor
brute
was
evidently
beside
itself
with
terror
it
showed
all
its
teeth
the
slaver
dropping
from
its
jaws
and
would
certainly
have
bitten
me
if
i
had
touched
it
it
did
not
seem
to
recognise
me
whoever
has
seen
at
the
zoological
gardens
a
rabbit
fascinated
by
a
serpent
cowering
in
a
corner
may
form
some
idea
of
the
anguish
which
the
dog
exhibited
finding
all
efforts
to
soothe
the
animal
in
vain
and
fearing
that
his
bite
might
be
as
venomous
in
that
state
as
if
in
the
madness
of
hydrophobia
i
left
him
alone
placed
my
weapons
on
the
table
beside
the
fire
seated
myself
and
recommenced
my
macaulay
perhaps
in
order
not
to
appear
seeking
credit
for
a
courage
or
rather
a
coolness
which
the
reader
may
conceive
i
exaggerate
i
may
be
pardoned
if
i
pause
to
indulge
in
one
or
two
egotistical
remarks
as
i
hold
presence
of
mind
or
what
is
called
courage
to
be
precisely
proportioned
to
familiarity
with
the
circumstance
that
lead
to
it
so
i
should
say
that
i
had
been
long
sufficiently
familiar
with
all
experiments
that
appertain
to
the
marvellous
i
had
witnessed
many
very
extraordinary
phenomena
in
various
parts
of
the
world
phenomena
that
would
be
either
totally
disbelieved
if
i
stated
them
or
ascribed
to
supernatural
agencies
now
my
theory
is
that
the
supernatural
is
the
impossible
and
that
what
is
called
supernatural
is
only
a
something
in
the
laws
of
nature
of
which
we
have
been
hitherto
ignorant
therefore
if
a
ghost
rise
before
me
i
have
not
the
right
to
say
so
then
the
supernatural
is
possible
but
rather
so
then
the
apparition
of
a
ghost
is
contrary
to
received
opinion
within
the
laws
of
nature
not
supernatural
now
in
all
that
i
had
hitherto
witnessed
and
indeed
in
all
the
wonders
which
the
amateurs
of
mystery
in
our
age
record
as
facts
a
material
living
agency
is
always
required
on
the
continent
you
will
find
still
magicians
who
assert
that
they
can
raise
spirits
assume
for
the
moment
that
they
assert
truly
still
the
living
material
form
of
the
magician
is
present
and
he
is
the
material
agency
by
which
from
some
constitutional
peculiarities
certain
strange
phenomena
are
represented
to
your
natural
senses
accept
again
as
truthful
the
tales
of
spirit
manifestation
in
america
musical
or
other
sounds
writings
on
paper
produced
by
no
discernible
hand
articles
of
furniture
moved
without
apparent
human
agency
or
the
actual
sight
and
touch
of
hands
to
which
no
bodies
seem
to
belong
still
there
must
be
found
the
or
living
being
with
constitutional
peculiarities
capable
of
obtaining
these
signs
in
fine
in
all
such
marvels
supposing
even
that
there
is
no
imposture
there
must
be
a
human
being
like
ourselves
by
whom
or
through
whom
the
effects
presented
to
human
beings
are
produced
it
is
so
with
the
now
familiar
phenomena
of
mesmerism
or
the
mind
of
the
person
operated
on
is
affected
through
a
material
living
agent
nor
supposing
it
true
that
a
mesmerised
patient
can
respond
to
the
will
or
passes
of
a
mesmeriser
a
hundred
miles
distant
is
the
response
less
occasioned
by
a
material
being
it
may
be
through
a
material
fluid
call
it
electric
call
it
odic
call
it
what
you
will
which
has
the
power
of
traversing
space
and
passing
obstacles
that
the
material
effect
is
communicated
from
one
to
the
other
hence
all
that
i
had
hitherto
witnessed
or
expected
to
witness
in
this
strange
house
i
believed
to
be
occasioned
through
some
agency
or
medium
as
mortal
as
myself
and
this
idea
necessarily
prevented
the
awe
with
which
those
who
regard
as
supernatural
things
that
are
not
within
the
ordinary
operations
of
nature
might
have
been
impressed
by
the
adventures
of
that
memorable
night
as
then
it
was
my
conjecture
that
all
that
was
presented
or
would
be
presented
to
my
senses
must
originate
in
some
human
being
gifted
by
constitution
with
the
power
so
to
present
them
and
having
some
motive
so
to
do
i
felt
an
interest
in
my
theory
which
in
its
way
was
rather
philosophical
than
superstitious
and
i
can
sincerely
say
that
i
was
in
as
tranquil
a
temper
for
observation
as
any
practical
experimentalist
could
be
in
awaiting
the
effects
of
some
rare
though
perhaps
perilous
chemical
combination
of
course
the
more
i
kept
my
mind
detached
from
fancy
the
more
the
temper
fitted
for
observation
would
be
obtained
and
i
therefore
riveted
eye
and
thought
on
the
strong
daylight
sense
in
the
page
of
my
macaulay
i
now
became
aware
that
something
interposed
between
the
page
and
the
light
the
page
was
overshadowed
i
looked
up
and
i
saw
what
i
shall
find
it
very
difficult
perhaps
impossible
to
describe
it
was
a
darkness
shaping
itself
out
of
the
air
in
very
undefined
outline
i
can
not
say
it
was
of
a
human
form
and
yet
it
had
more
resemblance
to
a
human
form
or
rather
shadow
than
anything
else
as
it
stood
wholly
apart
and
distinct
from
the
air
and
the
light
around
it
its
dimensions
seemed
gigantic
the
summit
nearly
touching
the
ceiling
while
i
gazed
a
feeling
of
intense
cold
seized
me
an
iceberg
before
me
could
not
more
have
chilled
me
nor
could
the
cold
of
an
iceberg
have
been
more
purely
physical
i
feel
convinced
that
it
was
not
the
cold
caused
by
fear
as
i
continued
to
gaze
i
thought
but
this
i
can
not
say
with
precision
that
i
distinguished
two
eyes
looking
down
on
me
from
the
height
one
moment
i
seemed
to
distinguish
them
clearly
the
next
they
seemed
gone
but
still
two
rays
of
a
light
frequently
shot
through
the
darkness
as
from
the
height
on
which
i
that
i
had
encountered
the
eyes
i
strove
to
speak
my
voice
utterly
failed
me
i
could
only
think
to
myself
is
this
fear
it
is
fear
i
strove
to
rise
in
vain
i
felt
as
if
weighed
down
by
an
irresistible
force
indeed
my
impression
was
that
of
an
immense
and
overwhelming
power
opposed
to
my
volition
that
sense
of
utter
inadequacy
to
cope
with
a
force
beyond
men
which
one
may
feel
in
a
storm
at
sea
in
a
conflagration
or
when
confronting
some
terrible
wild
beast
or
rather
perhaps
the
shark
of
the
ocean
i
felt
opposed
to
my
will
was
another
will
as
far
superior
to
its
strength
as
storm
fire
and
shark
are
superior
in
material
force
to
the
force
of
men
and
now
as
this
impression
grew
on
me
now
came
at
last
horror
horror
to
a
degree
that
no
words
can
convey
still
i
retained
pride
if
not
courage
and
in
my
own
mind
i
said
this
is
horror
but
it
is
not
fear
unless
i
fear
i
can
not
be
harmed
my
reason
rejects
this
thing
it
is
an
illusion
i
do
not
fear
with
a
violent
effort
i
succeeded
at
last
in
stretching
out
my
hand
towards
the
weapon
on
the
table
as
i
did
so
on
the
arm
and
shoulder
i
received
a
strange
shock
and
my
arm
fell
to
my
side
powerless
and
now
to
add
to
my
horror
the
light
began
slowly
to
wane
from
the
candles
they
were
not
as
it
were
extinguished
but
their
flame
seemed
very
gradually
withdrawn
it
was
the
same
with
the
fire
the
light
was
extracted
from
the
fuel
in
a
few
minutes
the
room
was
in
utter
darkness
the
dread
that
came
over
me
to
be
thus
in
the
dark
with
that
dark
thing
whose
power
was
so
intensely
felt
brought
a
reaction
of
nerve
in
fact
terror
had
reached
that
climax
that
either
my
senses
must
have
deserted
me
or
i
must
have
burst
through
the
spell
i
did
burst
through
it
i
found
voice
though
the
voice
was
a
shriek
i
remember
that
i
broke
forth
with
words
like
these
i
do
not
fear
my
soul
does
not
fear
and
at
the
same
time
i
found
the
strength
to
rise
still
in
that
profound
gloom
i
rushed
to
one
of
the
windows
tore
aside
the
curtain
flung
open
the
shutters
my
first
thought
was
light
and
when
i
saw
the
moon
high
clear
and
calm
i
felt
a
joy
that
almost
compensated
for
the
previous
terror
there
was
the
moon
there
was
also
the
light
from
the
in
the
deserted
slumberous
street
i
turned
to
look
back
into
the
room
the
moon
penetrated
its
shadow
very
palely
and
partially
but
still
there
was
light
the
dark
thing
whatever
it
might
be
was
gone
except
that
i
could
yet
see
a
dim
shadow
which
seemed
the
shadow
of
that
shade
against
the
opposite
wall
my
eye
now
rested
on
the
table
and
from
under
the
table
which
was
without
cloth
or
cover
an
old
mahogany
round
table
there
rose
a
hand
visible
as
far
as
the
wrist
it
was
a
hand
seemingly
as
much
of
flesh
and
blood
as
my
own
but
the
hand
of
an
aged
person
lean
wrinkled
small
too
a
woman
hand
that
hand
very
softly
closed
on
the
two
letters
that
lay
on
the
table
hand
and
letters
both
vanished
there
then
came
the
same
three
loud
measured
knocks
i
had
heard
at
the
before
this
extraordinary
drama
had
commenced
as
those
sounds
slowly
ceased
i
felt
the
whole
room
vibrate
sensibly
and
at
the
far
end
there
rose
as
from
the
floor
sparks
or
globules
like
bubbles
of
light
green
yellow
azure
up
and
down
to
and
fro
hither
thither
as
tiny
the
sparks
moved
slow
or
swift
each
at
its
own
caprice
a
chair
as
in
the
below
was
now
advanced
from
the
wall
without
apparent
agency
and
placed
at
the
opposite
side
of
the
table
suddenly
as
forth
from
the
chair
there
grew
a
shape
a
woman
shape
it
was
distinct
as
a
shape
of
life
ghastly
as
a
shape
of
death
the
face
was
that
of
youth
with
a
strange
mournful
beauty
the
throat
and
shoulders
were
bare
the
rest
of
the
form
in
a
loose
robe
of
cloudy
white
it
began
sleeking
its
long
yellow
hair
which
fell
over
its
shoulders
its
eyes
were
not
turned
towards
me
but
to
the
door
it
seemed
listening
watching
waiting
the
shadow
of
the
shade
in
the
background
grew
darker
and
again
i
thought
i
beheld
the
eyes
gleaming
out
from
the
summit
of
the
shadow
eyes
fixed
upon
that
shape
as
if
from
the
door
though
it
did
not
open
there
grew
out
another
shape
equally
distinct
equally
ghastly
a
man
shape
a
young
man
it
was
in
the
dress
of
the
last
century
or
rather
in
a
likeness
of
such
dress
for
both
the
male
shape
and
the
female
though
defined
were
evidently
unsubstantial
impalpable
simulacra
phantasms
and
there
was
something
incongruous
grotesque
yet
fearful
in
the
contrast
between
the
elaborate
finery
the
courtly
precision
of
that
garb
with
its
ruffles
and
lace
and
buckles
and
the
aspect
and
stillness
of
the
flitting
wearer
just
as
the
male
shape
approached
the
female
the
dark
shadow
started
from
the
wall
all
three
for
a
moment
wrapped
in
darkness
when
the
pale
light
returned
the
two
phantoms
were
as
if
in
the
grasp
of
the
shadow
that
towered
between
them
and
there
was
a
bloodstain
on
the
breast
of
the
female
and
the
was
leaning
on
its
and
blood
seemed
trickling
fast
from
the
ruffles
from
the
lace
and
the
darkness
of
the
intermediate
shadow
swallowed
them
up
they
were
gone
and
again
the
bubbles
of
light
shot
and
sailed
and
undulated
growing
thicker
and
thicker
and
more
wildly
confused
in
their
movements
the
to
the
right
of
the
fireplace
now
opened
and
from
the
aperture
there
came
the
form
of
a
woman
aged
in
her
hand
she
held
letters
the
very
letters
over
which
i
had
seen
hand
close
and
behind
her
i
heard
a
footstep
she
turned
round
as
if
to
listen
then
she
opened
the
letters
and
seemed
to
read
and
over
her
shoulder
i
saw
a
livid
face
the
face
as
of
a
man
long
drowned
bloated
bleached
seaweed
tangled
in
its
dripping
hair
and
at
her
feet
lay
a
form
as
of
a
corpse
and
beside
the
corpse
there
cowered
a
child
a
miserable
squalid
child
with
famine
in
its
cheeks
and
fear
in
its
eyes
and
as
i
looked
in
the
old
woman
face
the
wrinkles
and
lines
vanished
and
it
became
a
face
of
youth
stony
but
still
youth
and
the
shadow
darted
forth
and
darkened
over
these
phantoms
as
it
had
darkened
over
the
last
nothing
now
was
left
but
the
shadow
and
on
that
my
eyes
were
intently
fixed
till
again
eyes
grew
out
of
the
shadow
malignant
serpent
eyes
and
the
bubbles
of
light
again
rose
and
fell
and
in
their
disordered
irregular
turbulent
maze
mingled
with
the
wan
moonlight
and
now
from
these
globules
themselves
as
from
the
shell
of
an
egg
monstrous
things
burst
out
the
air
grew
filled
with
them
larvæ
so
bloodless
and
so
hideous
that
i
can
in
no
way
describe
them
except
to
remind
the
reader
of
the
swarming
life
which
the
solar
microscope
brings
before
his
eyes
in
a
drop
of
water
things
transparent
supple
agile
chasing
each
other
devouring
each
other
forms
like
nought
ever
beheld
by
the
naked
eye
as
the
shapes
were
without
symmetry
so
their
movements
were
without
order
in
their
very
vagrancies
there
was
no
sport
they
came
round
me
and
round
thicker
and
faster
and
swifter
swarming
over
my
head
crawling
over
my
right
arm
which
was
outstretched
in
involuntary
command
against
all
evil
beings
sometimes
i
felt
myself
touched
but
not
by
them
invisible
hands
touched
me
once
i
felt
the
clutch
as
of
cold
soft
fingers
at
my
throat
i
was
still
equally
conscious
that
if
i
gave
way
to
fear
i
should
be
in
bodily
peril
and
i
concentrated
all
my
faculties
in
the
single
focus
of
resisting
stubborn
will
and
i
turned
my
sight
from
the
shadow
above
all
from
those
strange
serpent
eyes
eyes
that
had
now
become
distinctly
visible
for
there
though
in
nought
else
around
me
i
was
aware
that
there
was
a
and
a
will
of
intense
creative
working
evil
which
might
crush
down
my
own
the
pale
atmosphere
in
the
room
began
now
to
redden
as
if
in
the
air
of
some
near
conflagration
the
larvæ
grew
lurid
as
things
that
live
in
fire
again
the
room
vibrated
again
were
heard
the
three
measured
knocks
and
again
all
things
were
swallowed
up
in
the
darkness
of
the
dark
shadow
as
if
out
of
that
darkness
all
had
come
into
that
darkness
all
returned
as
the
gloom
receded
the
shadow
was
wholly
gone
slowly
as
it
had
been
withdrawn
the
flame
grew
again
into
the
candles
on
the
table
again
into
the
fuel
in
the
grate
the
whole
room
came
once
more
calmly
healthfully
into
sight
the
two
doors
were
still
closed
the
door
communicating
with
the
servants
room
still
locked
in
the
corner
of
the
wall
into
which
he
had
so
convulsively
niched
himself
lay
the
dog
i
called
to
him
no
movement
i
approached
the
animal
was
dead
his
eyes
protruded
his
tongue
out
of
his
mouth
the
froth
gathered
round
his
jaws
i
took
him
in
my
arms
i
brought
him
to
the
fire
i
felt
acute
grief
for
the
loss
of
my
poor
favourite
acute
i
accused
myself
of
his
death
i
imagined
he
had
died
of
fright
but
what
was
my
surprise
on
finding
that
his
neck
was
actually
broken
actually
twisted
out
of
the
vertebræ
had
this
been
done
in
the
dark
must
it
not
have
been
by
a
hand
human
as
mine
must
there
not
have
been
a
human
agency
all
the
while
in
that
room
good
cause
to
suspect
it
i
can
not
tell
i
can
not
do
more
than
state
the
fact
fairly
the
reader
may
draw
his
own
inference
another
surprising
circumstance
my
watch
was
restored
to
the
table
from
which
it
had
been
so
mysteriously
withdrawn
but
it
had
stopped
at
the
very
moment
it
was
so
withdrawn
nor
despite
all
the
skill
of
the
watchmaker
has
it
ever
gone
since
that
is
it
will
go
in
a
strange
erratic
way
for
a
few
hours
and
then
comes
to
a
dead
stop
it
is
worthless
nothing
more
chanced
for
the
rest
of
the
night
nor
indeed
had
i
long
to
wait
before
the
dawn
broke
not
till
it
was
broad
daylight
did
i
quit
the
haunted
house
before
i
did
so
i
revisited
the
little
blind
room
in
which
my
servant
and
myself
had
been
for
a
time
imprisoned
i
had
a
strong
impression
for
which
i
could
not
account
that
from
that
room
had
originated
the
mechanism
of
the
phenomena
if
i
may
use
the
term
which
had
been
experienced
in
my
chamber
and
though
i
entered
it
now
in
the
clear
day
with
the
sun
peering
through
the
filmy
window
i
still
felt
as
i
stood
on
its
floor
the
creep
of
the
horror
which
i
had
first
there
experienced
the
night
before
and
which
had
been
so
aggravated
by
what
had
passed
in
my
own
chamber
i
could
not
indeed
bear
to
stay
more
than
half
a
minute
within
those
walls
i
descended
the
stairs
and
again
i
heard
the
footfall
before
me
and
when
i
opened
the
street
door
i
thought
i
could
distinguish
a
very
low
laugh
i
gained
my
own
home
expecting
to
find
my
runaway
servant
there
but
he
had
not
presented
himself
nor
did
i
hear
more
of
him
for
three
days
when
i
received
a
letter
from
him
dated
from
liverpool
to
this
effect
honoured
sir
i
humbly
entreat
your
pardon
though
i
can
scarcely
hope
that
you
will
think
i
deserve
it
unless
which
heaven
forbid
you
saw
what
i
did
i
feel
that
it
will
be
years
before
i
can
recover
myself
and
as
to
being
fit
for
service
it
is
out
of
the
question
i
am
therefore
going
to
my
at
melbourne
the
ship
sails
perhaps
the
long
voyage
may
set
me
up
i
do
nothing
now
but
start
and
tremble
and
fancy
it
is
behind
me
i
humbly
beg
you
honoured
sir
to
order
my
clothes
and
whatever
wages
are
due
to
me
to
be
sent
to
my
mother
at
walworth
john
knows
her
address
the
letter
ended
with
additional
apologies
somewhat
incoherent
and
explanatory
details
as
to
effects
that
had
been
under
the
charge
this
flight
may
perhaps
warrant
a
suspicion
that
the
man
wished
to
go
to
australia
and
had
been
somehow
or
other
fraudulently
mixed
up
with
the
events
of
the
night
i
say
nothing
in
refutation
of
that
conjecture
rather
i
suggest
it
as
one
that
would
seem
to
many
persons
the
most
probable
solution
of
improbable
occurrences
my
own
theory
remained
unshaken
i
returned
in
the
evening
to
the
house
to
bring
away
in
a
hack
cab
the
things
i
had
left
there
with
my
poor
dog
body
in
this
task
i
was
not
disturbed
nor
did
any
incident
worth
note
befall
me
except
that
still
on
ascending
and
descending
the
stairs
i
heard
the
same
footfall
in
advance
on
leaving
the
house
i
went
to
mr
j
he
was
at
home
i
returned
him
the
keys
told
him
that
my
curiosity
was
sufficiently
gratified
and
was
about
to
relate
quickly
what
had
passed
when
he
stopped
me
and
said
though
with
much
politeness
that
he
had
no
longer
any
interest
in
a
mystery
which
none
had
ever
solved
i
determined
at
least
to
tell
him
of
the
two
letters
i
had
read
as
well
as
of
the
extraordinary
manner
in
which
they
had
disappeared
and
i
then
inquired
if
he
thought
they
had
been
addressed
to
the
woman
who
had
died
in
the
house
and
if
there
were
anything
in
her
early
history
which
could
possibly
confirm
the
dark
suspicions
to
which
the
letters
gave
rise
mr
j
seemed
startled
and
after
musing
a
few
moments
answered
i
know
but
little
of
the
woman
earlier
history
except
as
i
before
told
you
that
her
family
were
known
to
mine
but
you
revive
some
vague
reminiscences
to
her
prejudice
i
will
make
inquiries
and
inform
you
of
their
result
still
even
if
we
could
admit
the
popular
superstition
that
a
person
who
had
been
either
the
perpetrator
or
the
victim
of
dark
crimes
in
life
could
revisit
as
a
restless
spirit
the
scene
in
which
those
crimes
had
been
committed
i
should
observe
that
the
house
was
infested
by
strange
sights
and
sounds
before
the
old
woman
died
you
smile
what
would
you
say
i
would
say
this
that
i
am
convinced
if
we
could
get
to
the
bottom
of
these
mysteries
we
should
find
a
living
human
agency
what
you
believe
it
is
all
an
imposture
for
what
object
not
an
imposture
in
the
ordinary
sense
of
the
word
if
suddenly
i
were
to
sink
into
a
deep
sleep
from
which
you
could
not
awake
me
but
in
that
sleep
could
answer
questions
with
an
accuracy
which
i
could
not
pretend
to
when
awake
tell
you
what
money
you
had
in
your
pocket
nay
describe
your
very
thoughts
it
is
not
necessarily
an
imposture
any
more
than
it
is
necessarily
supernatural
i
should
be
unconsciously
to
myself
under
a
mesmeric
influence
conveyed
to
me
from
a
distance
by
a
human
being
who
had
acquired
power
over
me
by
previous
granting
mesmerism
so
far
carried
to
be
a
fact
you
are
right
and
you
would
infer
from
this
that
a
mesmeriser
might
produce
the
extraordinary
effects
you
and
others
have
witnessed
over
inanimate
objects
fill
the
air
with
sights
and
sounds
or
impress
our
senses
with
the
belief
in
them
we
never
having
been
with
the
person
acting
on
us
no
what
is
commonly
called
mesmerism
could
not
do
this
but
there
may
be
a
power
akin
to
mesmerism
and
superior
to
it
the
power
that
in
the
old
days
was
called
magic
that
such
a
power
may
extend
to
all
inanimate
objects
of
matter
i
do
not
say
but
if
so
it
would
not
be
against
nature
only
a
rare
power
in
nature
which
might
be
given
to
constitutions
with
certain
peculiarities
and
cultivated
by
practice
to
an
extraordinary
degree
that
such
a
power
might
extend
over
the
dead
that
is
over
certain
thoughts
and
memories
that
the
dead
may
still
retain
and
compel
not
that
which
ought
properly
to
be
called
the
and
which
is
far
beyond
human
reach
but
rather
a
phantom
of
what
has
been
most
on
earth
to
make
itself
apparent
to
our
senses
is
a
very
ancient
though
obsolete
theory
upon
which
i
will
hazard
no
opinion
but
i
do
not
conceive
the
power
would
be
supernatural
let
me
illustrate
what
i
mean
from
an
experiment
which
paracelsus
describes
as
not
difficult
and
which
the
author
of
the
of
cites
as
credible
a
flower
perishes
you
burn
it
whatever
were
the
elements
of
that
flower
while
it
lived
are
gone
dispersed
you
know
not
whither
you
can
never
discover
nor
them
but
you
can
by
chemistry
out
of
the
burnt
dust
of
that
flower
raise
a
spectrum
of
the
flower
just
as
it
seemed
in
life
it
may
be
the
same
with
the
human
being
the
soul
has
so
much
escaped
you
as
the
essence
or
elements
of
the
flower
still
you
may
make
a
spectrum
of
it
and
this
phantom
though
in
the
popular
superstition
it
is
held
to
be
the
soul
of
the
departed
must
not
be
confounded
with
the
true
soul
it
is
but
the
eidolon
of
the
dead
form
hence
like
the
stories
of
ghosts
or
spirits
the
thing
that
most
strikes
us
is
the
absence
of
what
we
hold
to
be
soul
that
is
of
superior
emancipated
intelligence
they
come
for
little
or
no
object
they
seldom
speak
if
they
do
come
they
utter
no
ideas
above
that
of
an
ordinary
person
on
earth
these
american
have
published
volumes
of
communications
in
prose
and
verse
which
they
assert
to
be
given
in
the
names
of
the
most
illustrious
dead
shakespeare
bacon
heaven
knows
whom
those
communications
taking
the
best
are
certainly
not
a
whit
of
higher
order
than
would
be
communications
from
living
persons
of
fair
talent
and
education
they
are
wondrously
inferior
to
what
bacon
shakespeare
and
plato
said
and
wrote
when
on
earth
nor
what
is
more
notable
do
they
ever
contain
an
idea
that
was
not
on
the
earth
before
wonderful
therefore
as
such
phenomena
may
be
granting
them
to
be
truthful
i
see
much
that
philosophy
may
question
nothing
that
it
is
incumbent
on
philosophy
to
deny
viz
nothing
supernatural
they
are
but
ideas
conveyed
somehow
or
other
we
have
not
yet
discovered
the
means
from
one
mortal
brain
to
another
whether
in
so
doing
tables
walk
of
their
own
accord
or
shapes
appear
in
a
magic
circle
or
bodyless
hands
rise
and
remove
material
objects
or
a
thing
of
darkness
such
as
presented
itself
to
me
freeze
our
blood
still
am
i
persuaded
that
these
are
but
agencies
conveyed
as
by
electric
wires
to
my
own
brain
from
the
brain
of
another
in
some
constitutions
there
is
a
natural
chemistry
and
those
may
produce
chemic
wonders
in
others
a
natural
fluid
call
it
electricity
and
these
produce
electric
wonders
but
they
differ
in
this
from
normal
science
they
are
alike
objectless
purposeless
puerile
frivolous
they
lead
on
to
no
grand
results
and
therefore
the
world
does
not
heed
and
true
sages
have
not
cultivated
them
but
sure
i
am
that
of
all
i
saw
or
heard
a
man
human
as
myself
was
the
remote
originator
and
i
believe
unconsciously
to
himself
as
to
the
exact
effects
produced
for
this
reason
no
two
persons
you
say
have
ever
told
you
that
they
experienced
exactly
the
same
thing
well
observe
no
two
persons
ever
experience
exactly
the
same
dream
if
this
were
an
ordinary
imposture
the
machinery
would
be
arranged
for
results
that
would
but
little
vary
if
it
were
a
supernatural
agency
permitted
by
the
almighty
it
would
surely
be
for
some
definite
end
these
phenomena
belong
to
neither
class
my
persuasion
is
that
they
originate
in
some
brain
now
far
distant
that
that
brain
had
no
distinct
volition
in
anything
that
occurred
that
what
does
occur
reflects
but
its
devious
motley
thoughts
in
short
that
it
has
been
but
the
dreams
of
such
a
brain
put
into
action
and
invested
with
a
semisubstance
that
this
brain
is
of
immense
power
that
it
can
set
matter
into
movement
that
it
is
malignant
and
destructive
i
believe
some
material
force
must
have
killed
my
dog
it
might
for
aught
i
know
have
sufficed
to
kill
myself
had
i
been
as
subjugated
by
terror
as
the
dog
had
my
intellect
or
my
spirit
given
me
no
countervailing
resistance
in
my
will
it
killed
your
dog
that
is
fearful
indeed
it
is
strange
that
no
animal
can
be
induced
to
stay
in
that
house
not
even
a
cat
rats
and
mice
are
never
found
in
it
the
instincts
of
the
brute
creation
detect
influences
deadly
to
their
existence
man
reason
has
a
sense
less
subtle
because
it
has
a
resisting
power
more
supreme
but
enough
do
you
comprehend
my
theory
yes
though
imperfectly
and
i
accept
any
crotchet
pardon
the
word
however
odd
rather
than
embrace
at
once
the
notion
of
ghosts
and
hobgoblins
we
imbibed
in
our
nurseries
still
to
my
unfortunate
house
the
evil
is
the
same
what
on
earth
can
i
do
with
the
house
i
will
tell
you
what
i
would
do
i
am
convinced
from
my
own
internal
feelings
that
the
small
unfurnished
room
at
right
angles
to
the
door
of
the
bedroom
which
i
occupied
forms
a
or
receptacle
for
the
influences
which
haunt
the
house
and
i
strongly
advise
you
to
have
the
walls
opened
the
floor
removed
nay
the
whole
room
pulled
down
i
observe
that
it
is
detached
from
the
body
of
the
house
built
over
the
small
and
could
be
removed
without
injury
to
the
rest
of
the
building
and
you
think
if
i
did
that
you
would
cut
off
the
telegraph
wires
try
it
i
am
so
persuaded
that
i
am
right
that
i
will
pay
half
the
expense
if
you
will
allow
me
to
direct
the
operations
nay
i
am
well
able
to
afford
the
cost
for
the
rest
allow
me
to
write
to
you
about
ten
days
afterwards
i
received
a
letter
from
mr
j
telling
me
that
he
had
visited
the
house
since
i
had
seen
him
that
he
had
found
the
two
letters
i
had
described
replaced
in
the
drawer
from
which
i
had
taken
them
that
he
had
read
them
with
misgivings
like
my
own
that
he
had
instituted
a
cautious
inquiry
about
the
woman
to
whom
i
rightly
conjectured
they
had
been
written
it
seemed
that
years
ago
a
year
before
the
date
of
the
letters
she
had
married
against
the
wish
of
her
relatives
an
american
of
very
suspicious
character
in
fact
he
was
generally
believed
to
have
been
a
pirate
she
herself
was
the
daughter
of
very
respectable
tradespeople
and
had
served
in
the
capacity
of
a
nursery
governess
before
her
marriage
she
had
a
brother
a
widower
who
was
considered
wealthy
and
who
had
one
child
of
about
six
years
old
a
month
after
the
marriage
the
body
of
this
brother
was
found
in
the
thames
near
london
bridge
there
seemed
some
marks
of
violence
about
his
throat
but
they
were
not
deemed
sufficient
to
warrant
the
inquest
in
any
other
verdict
than
that
of
found
drowned
the
american
and
his
wife
took
charge
of
the
little
boy
the
deceased
brother
having
by
his
will
left
his
sister
the
guardian
of
his
only
child
and
in
the
event
of
the
child
death
the
sister
inherited
the
child
died
about
six
months
afterwards
it
was
supposed
to
have
been
neglected
and
the
neighbours
deposed
to
have
heard
it
shriek
at
night
the
surgeon
who
had
examined
it
after
death
said
that
it
was
emaciated
as
if
from
want
of
nourishment
and
the
body
was
covered
with
livid
bruises
it
seemed
that
one
winter
night
the
child
had
sought
to
escape
crept
out
into
the
tried
to
scale
the
wall
fallen
back
exhausted
and
been
found
at
morning
on
the
stones
in
a
dying
state
but
though
there
was
some
evidence
of
cruelty
there
was
none
of
murder
and
the
aunt
and
her
husband
had
sought
to
palliate
cruelty
by
alleging
the
exceeding
stubbornness
and
perversity
of
the
child
who
was
declared
to
be
be
that
as
it
may
at
the
orphan
death
the
aunt
inherited
her
brother
fortune
before
the
first
wedded
year
was
out
the
american
quitted
england
abruptly
and
never
returned
to
it
he
obtained
a
cruising
vessel
which
was
lost
in
the
atlantic
two
years
afterwards
the
widow
was
left
in
affluence
but
reverses
of
various
kinds
had
befallen
her
a
bank
broke
an
investment
failed
she
went
into
a
small
business
and
became
insolvent
then
she
entered
into
service
sinking
lower
and
lower
from
housekeeper
down
to
never
long
retaining
a
place
though
nothing
peculiar
against
her
character
was
ever
alleged
she
was
considered
sober
honest
and
peculiarly
quiet
in
her
ways
still
nothing
prospered
with
her
and
so
she
had
dropped
into
the
workhouse
from
which
mr
j
had
taken
her
to
be
placed
in
charge
of
the
very
house
which
she
had
rented
as
mistress
in
the
first
year
of
her
wedded
life
mr
j
added
that
he
had
passed
an
hour
alone
in
the
unfurnished
room
which
i
had
urged
him
to
destroy
and
that
his
impressions
of
dread
while
there
were
so
great
though
he
had
neither
heard
nor
seen
anything
that
he
was
eager
to
have
the
walls
bared
and
the
floors
removed
as
i
had
suggested
he
had
engaged
persons
for
the
work
and
would
commence
any
day
i
would
name
the
day
was
accordingly
fixed
i
repaired
to
the
haunted
house
we
went
into
the
blind
dreary
room
took
up
the
skirting
and
then
the
floors
under
the
rafters
covered
with
rubbish
was
found
a
quite
large
enough
to
admit
a
man
it
was
closely
nailed
down
with
clamps
and
rivets
of
iron
on
removing
these
we
descended
into
a
room
below
the
existence
of
which
had
never
been
suspected
in
this
room
there
had
been
a
window
and
a
flue
but
they
had
been
bricked
over
evidently
for
many
years
by
the
help
of
candles
we
examined
this
place
it
still
retained
some
mouldering
furniture
three
chairs
an
oak
settle
a
table
all
of
the
fashion
of
about
eighty
years
ago
there
was
a
chest
of
drawers
against
the
wall
in
which
we
found
away
articles
of
a
man
dress
such
as
might
have
been
worn
eighty
or
a
hundred
years
ago
by
a
gentleman
of
some
rank
costly
steel
buckles
and
buttons
like
those
yet
worn
in
court
dresses
a
handsome
court
sword
in
a
waistcoat
which
had
once
been
rich
with
gold
lace
but
which
was
now
blackened
and
foul
with
damp
we
found
five
guineas
a
few
silver
coins
and
an
ivory
ticket
probably
for
some
place
of
entertainment
long
since
passed
away
but
our
main
discovery
was
in
a
kind
of
iron
safe
fixed
to
the
wall
the
lock
of
which
it
cost
us
much
trouble
to
get
picked
in
this
safe
were
three
shelves
and
two
small
drawers
ranged
on
the
shelves
were
several
small
bottles
of
crystal
hermetically
stopped
they
contained
colourless
volatile
essences
of
what
nature
i
shall
say
no
more
than
that
they
were
not
poisons
phosphor
and
ammonia
entered
into
some
of
them
there
were
also
some
very
curious
glass
tubes
and
a
small
pointed
rod
of
iron
with
a
large
lump
of
and
another
of
amber
also
a
loadstone
of
great
power
in
one
of
the
drawers
we
found
a
miniature
portrait
set
in
gold
and
retaining
the
freshness
of
its
colours
most
remarkably
considering
the
length
of
time
it
had
probably
been
there
the
portrait
was
that
of
a
man
who
might
be
somewhat
advanced
in
middle
life
perhaps
or
it
was
a
most
peculiar
face
a
most
impressive
face
if
you
could
fancy
some
mighty
serpent
transformed
into
man
preserving
in
the
human
lineaments
the
old
serpent
type
you
would
have
a
better
idea
of
that
countenance
than
long
descriptions
can
convey
the
width
and
flatness
of
frontal
the
tapering
elegance
of
contour
disguising
the
strength
of
the
deadly
jaw
the
long
large
terrible
eye
glittering
and
green
as
the
emerald
and
withal
a
certain
ruthless
calm
as
if
from
the
consciousness
of
an
immense
power
the
strange
thing
was
this
the
instant
i
saw
the
miniature
i
recognised
a
startling
likeness
to
one
of
the
rarest
portraits
in
the
world
the
portrait
of
a
man
of
a
rank
only
below
that
of
royalty
who
in
his
own
day
had
made
a
considerable
noise
history
says
little
or
nothing
of
him
but
search
the
correspondence
of
his
contemporaries
and
you
find
reference
to
his
wild
daring
his
bold
profligacy
his
restless
spirit
his
taste
for
the
occult
sciences
while
still
in
the
meridian
of
life
he
died
and
was
buried
so
say
the
chronicles
in
a
foreign
land
he
died
in
time
to
escape
the
grasp
of
the
law
for
he
was
accused
of
crimes
which
would
have
given
him
to
the
headsman
after
his
death
the
portraits
of
him
which
had
been
numerous
for
he
had
been
a
munificent
encourager
of
art
were
bought
up
and
destroyed
it
was
supposed
by
his
heirs
who
might
have
been
glad
could
they
have
razed
his
very
name
from
their
splendid
line
he
had
enjoyed
a
vast
wealth
a
large
portion
of
this
was
believed
to
have
been
embezzled
by
a
favourite
astrologer
or
soothsayer
at
all
events
it
had
unaccountably
vanished
at
the
time
of
his
death
one
portrait
alone
of
him
was
supposed
to
have
escaped
the
general
destruction
i
had
seen
it
in
the
house
of
a
collector
some
months
before
it
had
made
on
me
a
wonderful
impression
as
it
does
on
all
who
behold
it
a
face
never
to
be
forgotten
and
there
was
that
face
in
the
miniature
that
lay
within
my
hand
true
that
in
the
miniature
the
man
was
a
few
years
older
than
in
the
portrait
i
had
seen
or
than
the
original
was
even
at
the
time
of
his
death
but
a
few
years
why
between
the
date
in
which
flourished
that
direful
noble
and
the
date
in
which
the
miniature
was
evidently
painted
there
was
an
interval
of
more
than
two
centuries
while
i
was
thus
gazing
silent
and
wondering
mr
j
said
but
is
it
possible
i
have
known
this
man
how
where
i
cried
in
india
he
was
high
in
the
confidence
of
the
rajah
of
and
wellnigh
drew
him
into
a
revolt
which
would
have
lost
the
rajah
his
dominions
the
man
was
a
frenchman
his
name
de
v
clever
bold
lawless
we
insisted
on
his
dismissal
and
banishment
it
must
be
the
same
man
no
two
faces
like
his
yet
this
miniature
seems
nearly
a
hundred
years
old
mechanically
i
turned
round
the
miniature
to
examine
the
back
of
it
and
on
the
back
was
engraved
a
pentacle
in
the
middle
of
the
pentacle
a
ladder
and
the
third
step
of
the
ladder
was
formed
by
the
date
examining
still
more
minutely
i
detected
a
spring
this
on
being
pressed
opened
the
back
of
the
miniature
as
a
lid
withinside
the
lid
was
engraved
mariana
to
thee
be
faithful
in
life
and
in
death
to
here
follows
a
name
that
i
will
not
mention
but
it
was
not
unfamiliar
to
me
i
had
heard
it
spoken
of
by
old
men
in
my
childhood
as
the
name
borne
by
a
dazzling
charlatan
who
had
made
a
great
sensation
in
london
for
a
year
or
so
and
had
fled
the
country
on
the
charge
of
a
double
murder
within
his
own
house
that
of
his
mistress
and
his
rival
i
said
nothing
of
this
to
mr
j
to
whom
reluctantly
i
resigned
the
miniature
we
had
found
no
difficulty
in
opening
the
first
drawer
within
the
iron
safe
we
found
great
difficulty
in
opening
the
second
it
was
not
locked
but
it
resisted
all
efforts
till
we
inserted
in
the
chinks
the
edge
of
a
chisel
when
we
had
thus
drawn
it
forth
we
found
a
very
singular
apparatus
in
the
nicest
order
upon
a
small
thin
book
or
rather
tablet
was
placed
a
saucer
of
crystal
this
saucer
was
filled
with
a
clear
liquid
on
that
liquid
floated
a
kind
of
compass
with
a
needle
shifting
rapidly
round
but
instead
of
the
usual
points
of
a
compass
were
seven
strange
characters
not
very
unlike
those
used
by
astrologers
to
denote
the
planets
a
very
peculiar
but
not
strong
nor
displeasing
odour
came
from
this
drawer
which
was
lined
with
a
wood
that
we
afterwards
discovered
to
be
hazel
whatever
the
cause
of
this
odour
it
produced
a
material
effect
on
the
nerves
we
all
felt
it
even
the
two
workmen
who
were
in
the
room
a
creeping
tingling
sensation
from
the
tips
of
the
fingers
to
the
roots
of
the
hair
impatient
to
examine
the
tablet
i
removed
the
saucer
as
i
did
so
the
needle
of
the
compass
went
round
and
round
with
exceeding
swiftness
and
i
felt
a
shock
that
ran
through
my
whole
frame
so
that
i
dropped
the
saucer
on
the
floor
the
liquid
was
spilt
the
saucer
was
broken
the
compass
rolled
to
the
end
of
the
room
and
at
that
instant
the
walls
shook
to
and
fro
as
if
a
giant
had
swayed
and
rocked
them
the
two
workmen
were
so
frightened
that
they
ran
up
the
ladder
by
which
we
had
descended
from
the
but
seeing
that
nothing
more
happened
they
were
easily
induced
to
return
meanwhile
i
had
opened
the
tablet
it
was
bound
in
a
plain
red
leather
with
a
silver
clasp
it
contained
but
one
sheet
of
thick
vellum
and
on
that
sheet
were
inscribed
within
a
double
pentacle
words
in
old
monkish
latin
which
are
literally
to
be
translated
thus
on
all
that
it
can
reach
within
these
walls
sentient
or
inanimate
living
or
dead
as
moves
the
needle
so
work
my
will
accursed
be
the
house
and
restless
be
the
dwellers
therein
we
found
no
more
mr
j
burnt
the
tablet
and
its
anathema
he
razed
to
the
foundations
the
part
of
the
building
containing
the
secret
room
with
the
chamber
over
it
he
had
then
the
courage
to
inhabit
the
house
himself
for
a
month
and
a
quieter
house
could
not
be
found
in
all
london
subsequently
he
let
it
to
advantage
and
his
tenant
has
made
no
complaints
but
my
story
is
not
yet
done
a
few
days
after
mr
j
had
removed
into
the
house
i
paid
him
a
visit
we
were
standing
by
the
open
window
and
conversing
a
van
containing
some
articles
of
furniture
which
he
was
moving
from
his
former
house
was
at
the
door
i
had
just
urged
on
him
my
theory
that
all
those
phenomena
regarded
as
supermundane
had
emanated
from
a
human
brain
adducing
the
charm
or
rather
curse
we
had
found
and
destroyed
in
support
of
my
philosophy
mr
j
was
observing
in
reply
that
even
if
mesmerism
or
whatever
analogous
power
it
might
be
called
could
really
thus
work
in
the
absence
of
the
operator
and
produce
effects
so
extraordinary
still
could
those
effects
continue
when
the
operator
himself
was
dead
and
if
the
spell
had
been
wrought
and
indeed
the
room
walled
up
more
than
seventy
years
ago
the
probability
was
that
the
operator
had
long
since
departed
this
life
mr
j
i
say
was
thus
answering
when
i
caught
hold
of
his
arm
and
pointed
to
the
street
below
a
man
had
crossed
from
the
opposite
side
and
was
accosting
the
carrier
in
charge
of
the
van
his
face
as
he
stood
was
exactly
fronting
our
window
it
was
the
face
of
the
miniature
we
had
discovered
it
was
the
face
of
the
portrait
of
the
noble
three
centuries
ago
good
heavens
cried
mr
j
that
is
the
face
of
de
v
and
scarcely
a
day
older
than
when
i
saw
it
in
the
rajah
court
in
my
youth
seized
by
the
same
thought
we
both
hastened
downstairs
i
was
first
in
the
street
but
the
man
had
already
gone
i
caught
sight
of
him
however
not
many
yards
in
advance
and
in
another
moment
i
was
by
his
side
i
had
resolved
to
speak
to
him
but
when
i
looked
into
his
face
i
felt
as
if
it
were
impossible
to
do
so
that
eye
the
eye
of
the
serpent
fixed
and
held
me
spellbound
and
withal
about
the
man
whole
person
there
was
a
dignity
an
air
of
pride
and
station
and
superiority
that
would
have
made
anyone
habituated
to
the
usages
of
the
world
hesitate
long
before
venturing
upon
a
liberty
or
impertinence
and
what
could
i
say
what
was
it
i
would
ask
thus
ashamed
of
my
first
impulse
i
fell
a
few
paces
back
still
however
following
the
stranger
undecided
what
else
to
do
meanwhile
he
turned
the
corner
of
the
street
a
plain
carriage
was
in
waiting
with
a
servant
out
of
livery
dressed
like
a
at
the
carriage
door
in
another
moment
he
had
stepped
into
the
carriage
and
it
drove
off
i
returned
to
the
house
mr
j
was
still
at
the
street
door
he
had
asked
the
carrier
what
the
stranger
had
said
to
him
merely
asked
whom
that
house
now
belonged
to
the
same
evening
i
happened
to
go
with
a
friend
to
a
place
in
town
called
the
cosmopolitan
club
a
place
open
to
men
of
all
countries
all
opinions
all
degrees
one
orders
one
coffee
smokes
one
cigar
one
is
always
sure
to
meet
agreeable
sometimes
remarkable
persons
i
had
not
been
two
minutes
in
the
room
before
i
beheld
at
a
table
conversing
with
an
acquaintance
of
mine
whom
i
will
designate
by
the
initial
g
the
man
the
original
of
the
miniature
he
was
now
without
his
hat
and
the
likeness
was
yet
more
startling
only
i
observed
that
while
he
was
conversing
there
was
less
severity
in
the
countenance
there
was
even
a
smile
though
a
very
quiet
and
very
cold
one
the
dignity
of
mien
i
had
acknowledged
in
the
street
was
also
more
striking
a
dignity
akin
to
that
which
invests
some
prince
of
the
east
conveying
the
idea
of
supreme
indifference
and
habitual
indisputable
indolent
but
resistless
power
g
soon
after
left
the
stranger
who
then
took
up
a
scientific
journal
which
seemed
to
absorb
his
attention
i
drew
g
aside
who
and
what
is
that
gentleman
that
oh
a
very
remarkable
man
indeed
i
met
him
last
year
amidst
the
caves
of
petra
the
scriptural
edom
he
is
the
best
oriental
scholar
i
know
we
joined
company
had
an
adventure
with
robbers
in
which
he
showed
a
coolness
that
saved
our
lives
afterwards
he
invited
me
to
spend
a
day
with
him
in
a
house
he
had
bought
at
damascus
a
house
buried
amongst
almond
blossoms
and
roses
the
most
beautiful
thing
he
had
lived
there
for
some
years
quite
as
an
oriental
in
grand
style
i
half
suspect
he
is
a
renegade
immensely
rich
very
odd
by
the
by
a
great
mesmeriser
i
have
seen
him
with
my
own
eyes
produce
an
effect
on
inanimate
things
if
you
take
a
letter
from
your
pocket
and
throw
it
to
the
other
end
of
the
room
he
will
order
it
to
come
to
his
feet
and
you
will
see
the
letter
wriggle
itself
along
the
floor
till
it
has
obeyed
his
command
my
honour
is
true
i
have
seen
him
affect
even
the
weather
disperse
or
collect
clouds
by
means
of
a
glass
tube
or
wand
but
he
does
not
like
talking
of
these
matters
to
strangers
he
has
only
just
arrived
in
england
says
he
has
not
been
here
for
a
great
many
years
let
me
introduce
him
to
you
certainly
he
is
english
then
what
is
his
name
oh
a
very
homely
one
richards
and
what
is
his
birth
his
family
how
do
i
know
what
does
it
signify
no
doubt
some
parvenu
but
rich
so
infernally
rich
g
drew
me
up
to
the
stranger
and
the
introduction
was
effected
the
manners
of
mr
richards
were
not
those
of
an
adventurous
traveller
travellers
are
in
general
constitutionally
gifted
with
high
animal
spirits
they
are
talkative
eager
imperious
mr
richards
was
calm
and
subdued
in
tone
with
manners
which
were
made
distant
by
the
loftiness
of
punctilious
courtesy
the
manners
of
a
former
age
i
observed
that
the
english
he
spoke
was
not
exactly
of
our
day
i
should
even
have
said
that
the
accent
was
slightly
foreign
but
then
mr
richards
remarked
that
he
had
been
little
in
the
habit
for
many
years
of
speaking
in
his
native
tongue
the
conversation
fell
upon
the
changes
in
the
aspect
of
london
since
he
had
last
visited
our
metropolis
g
then
glanced
off
to
the
moral
changes
literary
social
political
the
great
men
who
were
removed
from
the
stage
within
the
last
twenty
years
the
new
great
men
who
were
coming
on
in
all
this
mr
richards
evinced
no
interest
he
had
evidently
read
none
of
our
living
authors
and
seemed
scarcely
acquainted
by
name
with
our
younger
statesmen
once
and
only
once
he
laughed
it
was
when
g
asked
him
whether
he
had
any
thoughts
of
getting
into
parliament
and
the
laugh
was
inward
sarcastic
sinister
a
sneer
raised
into
a
laugh
after
a
few
minutes
g
left
us
to
talk
to
some
other
acquaintances
who
had
just
lounged
into
the
room
and
i
then
said
quietly
i
have
seen
a
miniature
of
you
mr
richards
in
the
house
you
once
inhabited
and
perhaps
built
if
not
wholly
at
least
in
part
in
street
you
passed
by
that
house
this
morning
not
till
i
had
finished
did
i
raise
my
eyes
to
his
and
then
his
fixed
my
gaze
so
steadfastly
that
i
could
not
withdraw
it
those
fascinating
serpent
eyes
but
involuntarily
and
if
the
words
that
translated
my
thought
were
dragged
from
me
i
added
in
a
low
whisper
i
have
been
a
student
in
the
mysteries
of
life
and
nature
of
those
mysteries
i
have
known
the
occult
professors
i
have
the
right
to
speak
to
you
thus
and
i
uttered
a
certain
well
said
he
dryly
i
concede
the
right
what
would
you
ask
to
what
extent
human
will
in
certain
temperaments
can
extend
to
what
extent
can
thought
extend
think
and
before
you
draw
breath
you
are
in
china
true
but
my
thought
has
no
power
in
china
give
it
expression
and
it
may
have
you
may
write
down
a
thought
which
sooner
or
later
may
alter
the
whole
condition
of
china
what
is
a
law
but
a
thought
therefore
thought
is
infinite
therefore
thought
has
power
not
in
proportion
to
its
value
a
bad
thought
may
make
a
bad
law
as
potent
as
a
good
thought
can
make
a
good
one
yes
what
you
say
confirms
my
own
theory
through
invisible
currents
one
human
brain
may
transmit
its
ideas
to
other
human
brains
with
the
same
rapidity
as
a
thought
promulgated
by
visible
means
and
as
thought
is
imperishable
as
it
leaves
its
stamp
behind
it
in
the
natural
world
even
when
the
thinker
has
passed
out
of
this
world
so
the
thought
of
the
living
may
have
power
to
rouse
up
and
revive
the
thoughts
of
the
dead
such
as
those
thoughts
in
though
the
thought
of
the
living
can
not
reach
the
thoughts
which
the
dead
may
entertain
is
it
not
so
i
decline
to
answer
if
in
my
judgment
thought
has
the
limit
you
would
fix
to
it
but
proceed
you
have
a
special
question
you
wish
to
put
intense
malignity
in
an
intense
will
engendered
in
a
peculiar
temperament
and
aided
by
natural
means
within
the
reach
of
science
may
produce
effects
like
those
ascribed
of
old
to
evil
magic
it
might
thus
haunt
the
walls
of
a
human
habitation
with
spectral
revivals
of
all
guilty
thoughts
and
guilty
deeds
once
conceived
and
done
within
those
walls
all
in
short
with
which
the
evil
will
claims
and
affinity
imperfect
incoherent
fragmentary
snatches
at
the
old
dramas
acted
therein
years
ago
thoughts
thus
crossing
each
other
haphazard
as
in
the
nightmare
of
a
vision
growing
up
into
phantom
sights
and
sounds
and
all
serving
to
create
horror
not
because
those
sights
and
sounds
are
really
visitations
from
a
world
without
but
that
they
are
ghastly
monstrous
renewals
of
what
have
been
in
this
world
itself
set
into
malignant
play
by
a
malignant
mortal
and
it
is
through
the
material
agency
of
that
human
brain
that
these
things
would
acquire
even
a
human
power
would
strike
as
with
the
shock
of
electricity
and
might
kill
if
the
thought
of
the
person
assailed
did
not
rise
superior
to
the
dignity
of
the
original
assailer
might
kill
the
most
powerful
animal
if
unnerved
by
fear
but
not
injure
the
feeblest
man
if
while
his
flesh
crept
his
mind
stood
out
fearless
thus
when
in
old
stories
we
read
of
a
magician
rent
to
pieces
by
the
fiends
he
had
evoked
or
still
more
in
eastern
legends
that
one
magician
succeeds
by
arts
in
destroying
another
there
may
be
so
far
truth
that
a
material
being
has
clothed
from
its
own
evil
propensities
certain
elements
and
fluids
usually
quiescent
or
harmless
with
awful
shape
and
terrific
force
just
as
the
lightning
that
had
lain
hidden
and
innocent
in
the
cloud
becomes
by
natural
law
suddenly
visible
takes
a
distinct
shape
to
the
eye
and
can
strike
destruction
on
the
object
to
which
it
is
attracted
you
are
not
without
glimpses
of
a
very
mighty
secret
said
mr
richards
composedly
according
to
your
view
could
a
mortal
obtain
the
power
you
speak
of
he
would
necessarily
be
a
malignant
and
evil
being
if
the
power
were
exercised
as
i
have
said
most
malignant
and
most
evil
though
i
believe
in
the
ancient
traditions
that
he
could
not
injure
the
good
his
will
could
only
injure
those
with
whom
it
has
established
an
affinity
or
over
whom
it
forces
unresisted
sway
i
will
now
imagine
an
example
that
may
be
within
the
laws
of
nature
yet
seem
wild
as
the
fables
of
a
bewildered
monk
you
will
remember
that
albertus
magnus
after
describing
minutely
the
process
by
which
spirits
may
be
invoked
and
commanded
adds
emphatically
that
the
process
will
instruct
and
avail
only
to
the
few
that
a
must
be
born
a
that
is
born
with
a
peculiar
physical
temperament
as
a
man
is
born
a
poet
rarely
are
men
in
whose
constitution
lurks
this
occult
power
of
the
highest
order
of
intellect
usually
in
the
intellect
there
is
some
twist
perversity
or
disease
but
on
the
other
hand
they
must
possess
to
an
astonishing
degree
the
faculty
to
concentrate
thought
on
a
single
object
the
energic
faculty
that
we
call
therefore
though
their
intellect
be
not
sound
it
is
exceedingly
forcible
for
the
attainment
of
what
it
desires
i
will
imagine
such
a
person
gifted
with
this
constitution
and
its
concomitant
forces
i
will
place
him
in
the
loftier
grades
of
society
i
will
suppose
his
desires
emphatically
those
of
the
sensualist
he
has
therefore
a
strong
love
of
life
he
is
an
absolute
egotist
his
will
is
concentrated
in
himself
he
has
fierce
passions
he
knows
no
enduring
no
holy
affections
but
he
can
covet
eagerly
what
for
the
moment
he
desires
he
can
hate
implacably
what
opposes
itself
to
his
objects
he
can
commit
fearful
crimes
yet
feel
small
remorse
he
resorts
rather
to
curses
upon
others
than
to
penitence
for
his
misdeeds
circumstances
to
which
his
constitution
guides
him
lead
him
to
a
rare
knowledge
of
the
natural
secrets
which
may
serve
his
egotism
he
is
a
close
observer
where
his
passions
encourage
observation
he
is
a
minute
calculator
not
from
love
of
truth
but
where
love
of
self
sharpens
his
faculties
therefore
he
can
be
a
man
of
science
i
suppose
such
a
being
having
by
experience
learned
the
power
of
his
arts
over
others
trying
what
may
be
the
power
of
will
over
his
own
frame
and
studying
all
that
in
natural
philosophy
may
increase
that
power
he
loves
life
he
dreads
death
he
to
live
he
can
not
restore
himself
to
youth
he
can
not
entirely
stay
the
progress
of
death
he
can
not
make
himself
immortal
in
the
flesh
and
blood
but
he
may
arrest
for
a
time
so
prolonged
as
to
appear
incredible
if
i
said
it
that
hardening
of
the
parts
which
constitutes
old
age
a
year
may
age
him
no
more
than
an
hour
ages
another
his
intense
will
scientifically
trained
into
system
operates
in
short
over
the
wear
and
tear
of
his
own
frame
he
lives
on
that
he
may
not
seem
a
portent
and
a
miracle
he
from
time
to
time
seemingly
to
certain
persons
having
schemed
the
transfer
of
a
wealth
that
suffices
to
his
wants
he
disappears
from
one
corner
of
the
world
and
contrives
that
his
obsequies
shall
be
celebrated
he
reappears
at
another
corner
of
the
world
where
he
resides
undetected
and
does
not
revisit
the
scenes
of
his
former
career
till
all
who
could
remember
his
features
are
no
more
he
would
be
profoundly
miserable
if
he
had
affections
he
has
none
but
for
himself
no
good
man
would
accept
his
longevity
and
to
no
men
good
or
bad
would
he
or
could
he
communicate
its
true
secret
such
a
man
might
exist
such
a
man
as
i
have
described
i
see
now
before
me
duke
of
in
the
court
of
dividing
time
between
lust
and
brawl
alchemists
and
wizards

in
the
last
century

and

which
you

london
with
the
same
earthly
passions
which
filled
your
heart

the
school
of

execrable

of

i
warn
you
back
from

cities

of
healthful
men
back
to
the
ruins
of
departed
empires
back
to
the
deserts

unredeemed
there
answered
me
a
whisper
so
musical
so
potently
musical
that
it
seemed
to
enter
into
my
whole
being
and
subdue
me
despite
myself
thus
it
said
i
have
sought
one
like
you
for
the
last
hundred
years
now
i
have
found
you
we
part
not
till
i
know
what
i
desire
the
vision
that
sees
through
the
past
and
cleaves
through
the
veil
of
the
future
is
in
you
at
this
hour
never
before
never
to
come
again
the
vision
of
no
puling
fantastic
girl
of
no
somnambule
but
of
a
strong
man
with
a
vigorous
brain
soar
and
look
forth
as
he
spoke
i
felt
as
if
i
rose
out
of
myself
upon
eagle
wings
all
the
weight
seemed
gone
from
air
roofless
the
room
roofless
the
dome
of
space
i
was
not
in
the
body
where
i
knew
not
but
aloft
over
time
over
earth
again
i
heard
the
melodious
whisper
you
say
right
i
have
mastered
great
secrets
by
the
power
of
will
true
by
will
and
by
science
i
can
retard
the
process
of
years
but
death
comes
not
by
age
alone
can
i
frustrate
the
accidents
which
bring
death
upon
the
young
no
every
accident
is
a
providence
before
a
providence
snaps
every
human
will
shall
i
die
at
last
ages
and
ages
hence
by
the
slow
though
inevitable
growth
of
time
or
by
the
cause
that
i
call
accident
by
a
cause
you
call
accident
is
not
the
end
still
remote
asked
the
whisper
with
a
slight
tremor
regarded
as
my
life
regards
time
it
is
still
remote
and
shall
i
before
then
mix
with
the
world
of
men
as
i
did
ere
i
learned
these
secrets
resume
eager
interest
in
their
strife
and
their
trouble
battle
with
ambition
and
use
the
power
of
the
sage
to
win
the
power
that
belongs
to
kings
you
will
yet
play
a
part
on
the
earth
that
will
fill
earth
with
commotion
and
amaze
for
wondrous
designs
have
you
a
wonder
yourself
been
permitted
to
live
on
through
the
centuries
all
the
secrets
you
have
stored
will
then
have
their
uses
all
that
now
makes
you
a
stranger
amidst
the
generations
will
contribute
then
to
make
you
their
lord
as
the
trees
and
the
straws
are
drawn
into
a
whirlpool
as
they
spin
round
are
sucked
to
the
deep
and
again
tossed
aloft
by
the
eddies
so
shall
races
and
thrones
be
plucked
into
the
charm
of
your
vortex
awful
destroyer
but
in
destroying
made
against
your
own
will
a
constructor
and
that
date
too
is
far
off
far
off
when
it
comes
think
your
end
in
this
world
is
at
hand
how
and
what
is
the
end
look
east
west
south
and
north
in
the
north
where
you
never
yet
trod
towards
the
point
whence
your
instincts
have
warned
you
there
a
spectre
will
seize
you
is
death
i
see
a
ship
it
is
haunted
is
chased
it
sails
on
baffled
navies
sail
after
that
ship
it
enters
the
region
of
ice
it
passes
a
sky
red
with
meteors
two
moons
stand
on
high
over
i
see
the
ship
locked
between
white
defiles
they
are
i
see
the
dead
strew
the
decks
stark
and
livid
green
mould
on
their
limbs
all
are
dead
but
one
man
it
is
you
but
years
though
so
slowly
they
come
have
then
scathed
you
there
is
the
coming
of
age
on
your
brow
and
the
will
is
relaxed
in
the
cells
of
the
brain
still
that
will
though
enfeebled
exceeds
all
that
man
knew
before
you
through
the
will
you
live
on
gnawed
with
famine
and
nature
no
longer
obeys
you
in
that
region
the
sky
is
a
sky
of
iron
and
the
air
has
iron
clamps
and
the
wedge
in
the
ship
hark
how
it
cracks
and
groans
ice
will
imbed
it
as
amber
imbeds
a
straw
and
a
man
has
gone
forth
living
yet
from
the
ship
and
its
dead
and
he
has
clambered
up
the
spikes
of
an
iceberg
and
the
two
moons
gaze
down
on
his
form
that
man
is
yourself
and
terror
is
on
you
terror
and
terror
has
swallowed
your
will
and
i
see
swarming
up
the
steep
grey
grisly
things
the
bears
of
the
north
have
scented
their
quarry
they
come
near
you
and
nearer
shambling
and
rolling
their
bulk
and
in
that
day
every
moment
shall
seem
to
you
longer
than
the
centuries
through
which
you
have
passed
and
heed
this
after
life
moments
continued
make
the
bliss
or
the
hell
of
eternity
hush
said
the
whisper
but
the
day
you
assure
me
is
far
off
very
far
i
go
back
to
the
almond
and
rose
of
damascus
sleep
the
room
swam
before
my
eyes
i
became
insensible
when
i
recovered
i
found
g
holding
my
hand
and
smiling
he
said
you
who
have
always
declared
yourself
proof
against
mesmerism
have
succumbed
at
last
to
my
friend
richards
where
is
mr
richards
gone
when
you
passed
into
a
trance
saying
quietly
to
me
friend
will
not
wake
for
an
hour
i
asked
as
collectedly
as
i
could
where
mr
richards
lodged
at
the
trafalgar
hotel
give
me
your
arm
said
i
to
g
let
us
call
on
him
i
have
something
to
say
when
we
arrived
at
the
hotel
we
were
told
that
mr
richards
had
returned
twenty
minutes
before
paid
his
bill
left
directions
with
his
servant
a
greek
to
pack
his
effects
and
proceed
to
malta
by
the
steamer
that
should
leave
southampton
the
next
day
mr
richards
had
merely
said
of
his
own
movements
that
he
had
visits
to
pay
in
the
neighbourhood
of
london
and
it
was
uncertain
whether
he
should
be
able
to
reach
southampton
in
time
for
that
steamer
if
not
he
should
follow
in
the
next
one
the
waiter
asked
me
my
name
on
my
informing
him
he
gave
me
a
note
that
mr
richards
had
left
for
me
in
case
i
called
the
note
was
as
follows
i
wished
you
to
utter
what
was
in
your
mind
you
obeyed
i
have
therefore
established
power
over
you
for
three
months
from
this
day
you
can
communicate
to
no
living
man
what
has
passed
between
us
you
can
not
even
show
this
note
to
the
friend
by
your
side
during
three
months
silence
complete
as
to
me
and
mine
do
you
doubt
my
power
to
lay
on
you
this
command
try
to
disobey
me
at
the
end
of
the
third
month
the
spell
is
raised
for
the
rest
i
spare
you
i
shall
visit
your
grave
a
year
and
a
day
after
it
has
received
you
so
ends
this
strange
story
which
i
ask
no
one
to
believe
i
write
it
down
exactly
three
months
after
i
received
the
above
note
i
could
not
write
it
before
nor
could
i
show
to
g
in
spite
of
his
urgent
request
the
note
which
i
read
under
the
by
his
side
vii
the
botathen
ghost
by
the
rev
hawker
the
legend
of
parson
rudall
and
the
botathen
ghost
will
be
recognised
by
many
cornish
people
as
a
local
remembrance
of
their
boyhood
it
appears
from
the
diary
of
this
learned
master
of
the
for
such
was
his
office
as
well
as
perpetual
curate
of
the
parish
that
a
pestilential
disease
did
break
forth
in
our
town
in
the
beginning
of
the
year
yea
and
it
likewise
invaded
my
school
insomuch
that
therewithal
certain
of
the
chief
scholars
sickened
and
died
among
others
who
yielded
to
the
malign
influence
was
master
john
eliot
the
eldest
son
and
the
worshipful
heir
of
edward
eliot
esquire
of
trebursey
a
stripling
of
sixteen
years
of
age
but
of
uncommon
parts
and
hopeful
ingenuity
at
his
own
especial
motion
and
earnest
desire
i
did
consent
to
preach
his
funeral
sermon
it
should
be
remembered
here
that
howsoever
strange
and
singular
it
may
sound
to
us
that
a
mere
lad
should
formally
solicit
such
a
performance
at
the
hands
of
his
master
it
was
in
consonance
with
the
habitual
usage
of
those
times
the
old
services
for
the
dead
had
been
abolished
by
law
and
in
the
stead
of
sacrament
and
ceremony
month
mind
and
mind
the
sole
substitute
which
survived
was
the
general
desire
to
partake
as
they
called
it
of
a
posthumous
discourse
replete
with
lofty
eulogy
and
flattering
remembrance
of
the
living
and
the
dead
the
diary
proceeds
i
fulfilled
my
undertaking
and
preached
over
the
coffin
in
the
presence
of
a
full
assemblage
of
mourners
and
lachrymose
friends
an
ancient
gentleman
who
was
then
and
there
in
the
church
a
mr
bligh
of
botathen
was
much
affected
by
my
discourse
and
he
was
heard
to
repeat
to
himself
certain
parentheses
therefrom
especially
a
phrase
from
maro
virgilius
which
i
had
applied
to
the
deceased
youth
puer
ipse
fuit
cantari
dignus
the
cause
wherefore
this
old
gentleman
was
thus
moved
by
my
applications
was
this
he
had
a
and
only
son
a
child
who
but
a
very
few
months
before
had
been
not
unworthy
of
the
character
i
drew
of
young
master
eliot
but
who
by
some
strange
accident
had
of
late
quite
fallen
away
from
his
parent
hopes
and
become
moody
and
sullen
and
distraught
when
the
funeral
obsequies
were
over
i
had
no
sooner
come
out
of
the
church
than
i
was
accosted
by
this
aged
parent
and
he
besought
me
incontinently
with
a
singular
energy
that
i
would
resort
with
him
forthwith
to
his
abode
at
botathen
that
very
night
nor
could
i
have
delivered
myself
from
his
importunity
had
not
mr
eliot
urged
his
claim
to
enjoy
my
company
at
his
own
house
hereupon
i
got
loose
but
not
until
i
had
pledged
a
fast
assurance
that
i
would
pay
him
faithfully
an
early
visit
the
next
day
the
place
as
it
was
called
of
botathen
where
old
mr
bligh
resided
was
a
gabled
of
the
fifteenth
century
walled
and
mullioned
and
with
clustered
chimneys
of
stone
from
the
neighbouring
quarries
of
the
mansion
was
flanked
by
a
pleasaunce
or
enclosure
in
one
space
of
garden
and
lawn
and
it
was
surrounded
by
a
solemn
grove
of
trees
it
had
the
sombre
aspect
of
age
and
of
solitude
and
looked
the
very
scene
of
strange
and
supernatural
events
a
legend
might
well
belong
to
every
gloomy
glade
around
and
there
must
surely
be
a
haunted
room
somewhere
within
its
walls
hither
according
to
his
appointment
on
the
morrow
parson
rudall
betook
himself
another
clergyman
as
it
appeared
had
been
invited
to
meet
him
who
very
soon
after
his
arrival
proposed
a
walk
together
in
the
pleasaunce
on
the
pretext
of
showing
him
as
a
stranger
the
walks
and
trees
until
the
should
strike
there
with
much
prolixity
and
with
many
a
solemn
pause
his
brother
minister
proceeded
to
unfold
the
mystery
a
singular
infelicity
he
declared
had
befallen
young
master
bligh
once
the
hopeful
heir
of
his
parents
and
of
the
lands
of
botathen
whereas
he
had
been
from
childhood
a
blithe
and
merry
boy
gladness
like
isaac
of
old
of
his
father
age
he
had
suddenly
of
late
become
morose
and
silent
nay
even
austere
and
stern
dwelling
apart
always
solemn
often
in
tears
the
lad
had
at
first
repulsed
all
questions
as
to
the
origin
of
this
great
change
but
of
late
he
had
yielded
to
the
importunate
researches
of
his
parents
and
had
disclosed
the
secret
cause
it
appeared
that
he
resorted
every
day
by
a
pathway
across
the
fields
to
this
very
clergyman
house
who
had
charge
of
his
education
and
grounded
him
in
the
studies
suitable
to
his
age
in
the
course
of
his
daily
walk
he
had
to
pass
a
certain
heath
or
down
where
the
road
wound
along
through
tall
blocks
of
granite
with
open
spaces
of
grassy
sward
between
there
in
a
certain
spot
and
always
in
one
and
the
same
place
the
lad
declared
that
he
had
encountered
every
day
a
woman
with
a
pale
and
troubled
face
clothed
in
a
long
loose
garment
of
frieze
with
one
hand
always
stretched
forth
and
the
other
pressed
against
her
side
her
name
he
said
was
dorothy
dinglet
for
he
had
known
her
well
from
his
childhood
and
she
often
used
to
come
to
his
parents
house
but
that
which
troubled
him
was
that
she
had
now
been
dead
three
years
and
he
himself
had
been
with
the
neighbours
at
her
burial
so
that
as
the
youth
alleged
with
great
simplicity
since
he
had
seen
her
body
laid
in
the
grave
this
that
he
saw
every
day
must
needs
be
her
soul
or
ghost
again
and
again
said
the
clergyman
never
contradicts
himself
but
he
relates
the
same
and
the
simple
tale
as
a
thing
that
can
not
be
gainsaid
indeed
the
observance
is
keen
and
calm
for
a
boy
of
his
age
the
hair
of
the
appearance
sayeth
he
is
not
like
anything
alive
but
it
is
so
soft
and
light
that
it
seemeth
to
melt
away
while
you
look
but
her
eyes
are
set
and
never
blink
no
not
when
the
sun
shineth
full
upon
her
face
she
maketh
no
steps
but
seemeth
to
swim
along
the
top
of
the
grass
and
her
hand
which
is
stretched
out
alway
seemeth
to
point
at
something
far
away
out
of
sight
it
is
her
continual
coming
for
she
never
faileth
to
meet
him
and
to
pass
on
that
hath
quenched
his
spirits
and
although
he
never
seeth
her
by
night
yet
can
not
he
get
his
natural
rest
thus
far
the
clergyman
whereupon
the
dinner
clock
did
sound
and
we
went
into
the
house
after
dinner
when
young
master
bligh
had
withdrawn
with
his
tutor
under
excuse
of
their
books
the
parents
did
forthwith
beset
me
as
to
my
thoughts
about
their
son
said
i
warily
case
is
strange
but
by
no
means
impossible
it
is
one
that
i
will
study
and
fear
not
to
handle
if
the
lad
will
be
free
with
me
and
fulfil
all
that
i
desire
the
mother
was
overjoyed
but
i
perceived
that
old
mr
bligh
turned
pale
and
was
downcast
with
some
thought
which
however
he
did
not
express
then
they
bade
that
master
bligh
should
be
called
to
meet
me
in
the
pleasaunce
forthwith
the
boy
came
and
he
rehearsed
to
me
his
tale
with
an
open
countenance
and
withal
a
modesty
of
speech
verily
he
seemed
vultus
puer
ingenuique
pudoris
then
i
signified
to
him
my
purpose
said
i
will
go
together
to
the
place
and
if
as
i
doubt
not
the
woman
shall
appear
it
will
be
for
me
to
proceed
according
to
knowledge
and
by
rules
laid
down
in
my
books
the
unaltered
scenery
of
the
legend
still
survives
and
like
the
field
of
the
forty
footsteps
in
another
history
the
place
is
still
visited
by
those
who
take
interest
in
the
supernatural
tales
of
old
the
pathway
leads
along
a
moorland
waste
where
large
masses
of
rock
stand
up
here
and
there
from
the
grassy
turf
and
clumps
of
heath
and
gorse
weave
their
tapestry
of
golden
purple
garniture
on
every
side
amidst
all
these
and
winding
along
between
the
rocks
is
a
natural
footway
worn
by
the
scant
rare
tread
of
the
village
traveller
just
midway
a
somewhat
larger
stretch
than
usual
of
green
sod
expands
which
is
skirted
by
the
path
and
which
is
still
identified
as
the
legendary
haunt
of
the
phantom
by
the
name
of
parson
rudall
ghost
but
we
must
draw
the
record
of
the
first
interview
between
the
minister
and
dorothy
from
his
own
words
we
met
thus
he
writes
in
the
pleasaunce
very
early
and
before
any
others
in
the
house
were
awake
and
together
the
lad
and
myself
proceeded
towards
the
field
the
youth
was
quite
composed
and
carried
his
bible
under
his
arm
from
whence
he
read
to
me
verses
which
he
said
he
had
lately
picked
out
to
have
always
in
his
mind
these
were
job
vii
scarest
me
with
dreams
and
terrifiest
me
through
visions
and
deuteronomy
xxviii
the
morning
thou
shalt
say
would
to
god
it
were
the
evening
and
in
the
evening
thou
shalt
say
would
to
god
it
were
morning
for
the
fear
of
thine
heart
wherewith
thou
shalt
fear
and
for
the
sight
of
thine
eyes
which
thou
shalt
see
i
was
much
pleased
with
the
lad
ingenuity
in
these
pious
applications
but
for
mine
own
part
i
was
somewhat
anxious
and
out
of
cheer
for
aught
i
knew
this
might
be
a
the
most
stubborn
spirit
to
govern
and
guide
that
any
man
can
meet
and
the
most
perilous
withal
we
had
hardly
reached
the
accustomed
spot
when
we
both
saw
her
at
once
gliding
towards
us
punctually
as
the
ancient
writers
describe
the
motion
of
their
which
swoon
along
the
ground
neither
marking
the
sand
nor
bending
the
herbage
the
aspect
of
the
woman
was
exactly
that
which
had
been
related
by
the
lad
there
was
the
pale
and
stony
face
the
strange
and
misty
hair
the
eyes
firm
and
fixed
that
gazed
yet
not
on
us
but
something
that
they
saw
far
far
away
one
hand
and
arm
stretched
out
and
the
other
grasping
the
girdle
of
her
waist
she
floated
along
the
field
like
a
sail
upon
a
stream
and
glided
past
the
spot
where
we
stood
pausingly
but
so
deep
was
the
awe
that
overcame
me
as
i
stood
there
in
the
light
of
day
face
to
face
with
a
human
soul
separate
from
her
bones
and
flesh
that
my
heart
and
purpose
both
failed
me
i
had
resolved
to
speak
to
the
spectre
in
the
appointed
form
of
words
but
i
did
not
i
stood
like
one
amazed
and
speechless
until
she
had
passed
clean
out
of
sight
one
thing
remarkable
came
to
pass
a
spaniel
dog
the
favourite
of
young
master
bligh
had
followed
us
and
lo
when
the
woman
drew
nigh
the
poor
creature
began
to
yell
and
bark
piteously
and
ran
backward
and
away
like
a
thing
dismayed
and
appalled
we
returned
to
the
house
and
after
i
had
said
all
that
i
could
to
pacify
the
lad
and
to
soothe
the
aged
people
i
took
my
leave
for
that
time
with
a
promise
that
when
i
had
fulfilled
certain
business
elsewhere
which
i
then
alleged
i
would
return
and
take
orders
to
assuage
these
disturbances
and
their
cause
january
at
my
own
house
i
find
by
my
books
what
is
expedient
to
be
done
and
then
apage
sathanas
january
this
day
i
took
leave
of
my
wife
and
family
under
pretext
of
engagements
elsewhere
and
made
my
secret
journey
to
our
diocesan
city
wherein
the
good
and
venerable
bishop
then
abode
january
in
safe
arrival
at
exeter
craved
and
obtained
immediate
audience
of
his
lordship
pleading
it
was
for
counsel
and
admonition
on
a
weighty
and
pressing
cause
called
to
the
presence
made
obeisance
and
then
by
command
stated
my
case
the
botathen
perplexity
which
i
moved
with
strong
and
earnest
instances
and
solemn
asseverations
of
that
which
i
had
myself
seen
and
heard
demanded
by
his
lordship
what
was
the
succour
that
i
had
come
to
entreat
at
his
hands
replied
licence
for
my
exorcism
that
so
i
might
ministerially
allay
this
spiritual
visitant
and
thus
render
to
the
living
and
the
dead
release
from
this
surprise
said
our
bishop
what
authority
do
you
allege
that
i
am
intrusted
with
faculty
so
to
do
our
church
as
is
well
known
hath
abjured
certain
branches
of
her
ancient
power
on
grounds
of
perversion
and
abuse
my
lord
i
humbly
answered
favour
the
of
the
canons
ratified
and
enjoined
on
us
the
clergy
anno
domini
doth
expressly
provide
that
no
minister
he
the
licence
of
his
diocesan
bishop
shall
essay
to
exorcise
a
spirit
evil
or
good
therefore
it
was
i
did
here
mildly
allege
i
did
not
presume
to
enter
on
such
a
work
without
lawful
privilege
under
your
lordship
hand
and
seal
hereupon
did
our
wise
and
learned
bishop
sitting
in
his
chair
condescend
upon
the
theme
at
some
length
with
many
gracious
interpretations
from
ancient
writers
and
from
holy
scripture
and
i
did
humbly
rejoin
and
reply
till
the
upshot
was
that
he
did
call
in
his
secretary
and
command
him
to
draw
the
aforesaid
faculty
forthwith
and
without
further
delay
assigning
him
a
form
insomuch
that
the
matter
was
incontinently
done
and
after
i
had
disbursed
into
the
secretary
hands
certain
moneys
for
signitary
purposes
as
the
manner
of
such
officers
hath
always
been
the
bishop
did
himself
affix
his
signature
under
the
of
his
see
and
deliver
the
document
into
my
hands
when
i
knelt
down
to
receive
his
benediction
he
softly
said
it
be
secret
mr
weak
brethren
weak
brethren
this
interview
with
the
bishop
and
the
success
with
which
he
vanquished
his
lordship
scruples
would
seem
to
have
confirmed
parson
rudall
very
strongly
in
his
own
esteem
and
to
have
invested
him
with
that
courage
which
he
evidently
lacked
at
his
first
encounter
with
the
ghost
the
entries
proceed
january
therewithal
did
i
hasten
home
and
prepare
my
instruments
and
cast
my
figures
for
the
onset
of
the
next
day
took
out
my
ring
of
brass
and
put
it
on
the
of
my
right
hand
with
the
traced
thereon
january
rode
into
the
gateway
at
botathen
armed
at
all
points
but
not
with
saul
armour
and
ready
there
is
danger
from
the
demons
but
so
there
is
in
the
surrounding
air
every
day
at
early
morning
then
and
alone
for
so
the
usage
ordains
i
betook
me
towards
the
field
it
was
void
and
i
had
thereby
due
time
to
prepare
first
i
paced
and
measured
out
my
circle
on
the
grass
then
did
i
mark
my
pentacle
in
the
very
midst
and
at
the
intersection
of
the
five
angles
i
did
set
up
and
fix
my
crutch
of
rowan
lastly
i
took
my
station
south
at
the
true
line
of
the
meridian
and
stood
facing
due
north
i
waited
and
watched
for
a
long
time
at
last
there
was
a
kind
of
trouble
in
the
air
a
soft
and
rippling
sound
and
all
at
once
the
shape
appeared
and
came
on
towards
me
gradually
i
opened
my
parchment
scroll
and
read
aloud
the
command
she
paused
and
seemed
to
waver
and
doubt
stood
still
then
i
rehearsed
the
sentence
sounding
out
every
syllable
like
a
chant
she
drew
near
my
ring
but
halted
at
first
outside
on
the
brink
i
sounded
again
and
now
at
the
third
time
i
gave
the
signal
in
syriac
the
speech
which
is
used
they
say
where
such
ones
dwell
and
converse
in
thoughts
that
glide
she
was
at
last
obedient
and
swam
into
the
midst
of
the
circle
and
there
stood
still
suddenly
i
saw
moreover
that
she
drew
back
her
pointing
hand
all
this
while
i
do
confess
that
my
knees
shook
under
me
and
the
drops
of
sweat
ran
down
my
flesh
like
rain
but
now
although
face
to
face
with
the
spirit
my
heart
grew
calm
and
my
mind
was
composed
i
knew
that
the
pentacle
would
govern
her
and
the
ring
must
bind
until
i
gave
the
word
then
i
called
to
mind
the
rule
laid
down
of
old
that
no
angel
or
fiend
no
spirit
good
or
evil
will
ever
speak
until
they
have
been
first
spoken
to
this
is
the
great
law
of
prayer
god
himself
will
not
yield
reply
until
man
hath
made
vocal
entreaty
once
and
again
so
i
went
on
to
demand
as
the
books
advise
and
the
phantom
made
answer
willingly
questioned
wherefore
not
at
rest
unquiet
because
of
a
certain
sin
asked
what
and
by
whom
revealed
it
but
it
is
and
therefore
more
anon
inquired
what
sign
she
could
give
that
she
was
a
true
spirit
and
not
a
false
fiend
stated
before
next
a
fearful
pestilence
would
lay
waste
the
land
and
myriads
of
souls
would
be
loosened
from
their
flesh
until
as
she
piteously
said
valleys
will
be
full
asked
again
why
she
so
terrified
the
lad
replied
is
the
law
we
must
seek
a
youth
or
a
maiden
of
clean
life
and
under
age
to
receive
messages
and
admonitions
we
conversed
with
many
more
words
but
it
is
not
lawful
for
me
to
set
them
down
pen
and
ink
would
degrade
and
defile
the
thoughts
she
uttered
and
which
my
mind
received
that
day
i
broke
the
ring
and
she
passed
but
to
return
once
more
next
day
at
a
long
discourse
with
that
ancient
transgressor
mr
b
great
horror
and
remorse
entire
atonement
and
penance
whatsoever
i
enjoin
full
acknowledgment
before
pardon
january
at
sunrise
i
was
again
in
the
field
she
came
in
at
once
and
as
it
seemed
with
freedom
inquired
if
she
knew
my
thoughts
and
what
i
was
going
to
relate
answered
we
only
know
what
we
perceive
and
hear
we
can
not
see
the
heart
then
i
rehearsed
the
penitent
words
of
the
man
she
had
come
up
to
denounce
and
the
satisfaction
he
would
perform
then
said
she
in
our
midst
i
went
through
the
proper
forms
of
dismissal
and
fulfilled
all
as
it
was
set
down
and
written
in
my
memoranda
and
then
with
certain
fixed
rites
i
did
dismiss
that
troubled
ghost
until
she
peacefully
withdrew
gliding
towards
the
west
neither
did
she
ever
afterward
appear
but
was
allayed
until
she
shall
come
in
her
second
flesh
to
the
valley
of
armageddon
on
the
last
day
these
quaint
and
curious
details
from
the
diurnal
of
a
clergyman
of
the
seventeenth
century
appear
to
betoken
his
personal
persuasion
of
the
truth
of
what
he
saw
and
said
although
the
statements
are
strongly
tinged
with
what
some
may
term
the
superstition
and
others
the
excessive
belief
of
those
times
it
is
a
singular
fact
however
that
the
canon
which
authorises
exorcism
under
episcopal
licence
is
still
a
part
of
the
ecclesiastical
law
of
the
anglican
church
although
it
might
have
a
singular
effect
on
the
nerves
of
certain
of
our
bishops
if
their
clergy
were
to
resort
to
them
for
the
faculty
which
parson
rudall
obtained
the
general
facts
stated
in
his
diary
are
to
this
day
matters
of
belief
in
that
neighbourhood
and
it
has
been
always
accounted
a
strong
proof
of
the
veracity
of
the
parson
and
the
ghost
that
the
plague
fatal
to
so
many
thousands
did
break
out
in
london
at
the
close
of
that
very
year
we
may
well
excuse
a
triumphant
entry
on
a
subsequent
page
of
the
diurnal
with
the
date
of
july
how
sorely
must
the
infidels
and
heretics
of
this
generation
be
dismayed
when
they
know
that
this
black
death
which
is
now
swallowing
its
thousands
in
the
streets
of
the
great
city
was
foretold
six
months
agone
under
the
exorcisms
of
a
country
minister
by
a
visible
and
suppliant
ghost
and
what
pleasures
and
improvements
do
such
deny
themselves
who
scorn
and
avoid
all
opportunity
of
intercourse
with
souls
separate
and
the
spirits
glad
and
sorrowful
which
inhabit
the
unseen
world
viii
the
ghost
of
lord
clarenceux
by
arnold
bennett
in
the
chair
which
stood
before
the
in
the
middle
of
the
room
sat
the
figure
of
lord
clarenceux
the
figure
did
not
move
as
i
went
in
its
back
was
towards
me
at
the
other
end
of
the
room
was
the
doorway
which
led
to
the
small
bedroom
little
more
than
an
alcove
and
the
gaze
of
the
apparition
was
fixed
on
this
doorway
i
closed
the
door
behind
me
and
locked
it
and
then
stood
still
in
the
over
the
mantelpiece
i
saw
a
drawn
pale
agitated
face
in
which
all
the
trouble
in
the
world
seemed
to
reside
it
was
my
own
face
i
was
alone
in
the
room
with
the
ghost
the
ghost
which
jealous
of
my
love
for
the
woman
it
had
loved
meant
to
revenge
itself
by
my
death
the
ghost
did
i
say
i
looked
at
it
no
one
would
have
taken
it
for
an
apparition
small
wonder
that
till
the
previous
evening
i
had
never
suspected
it
to
be
other
than
a
man
it
was
dressed
in
black
it
had
the
very
aspect
of
life
i
could
follow
the
creases
in
the
black
coat
the
direction
of
the
nap
of
the
silk
hat
how
well
by
this
time
i
knew
the
faultless
black
coat
and
that
impeccable
hat
yet
it
seemed
that
i
could
not
examine
them
too
closely
i
pierced
them
with
the
intensity
of
my
fascinated
glance
yes
i
pierced
them
for
showing
faintly
through
the
coat
i
could
discern
the
outline
of
the
table
which
should
have
been
hidden
by
the
man
figure
and
through
the
hat
i
could
see
the
handle
of
the
french
window
as
i
stood
motionless
there
solitary
in
the
glow
of
the
electric
light
with
this
fearful
visitor
i
began
to
wish
that
it
would
move
i
wanted
to
face
it
to
meet
its
gaze
with
my
gaze
eye
to
eye
and
will
against
will
the
battle
between
us
must
start
at
once
i
thought
if
i
was
to
have
any
chance
of
victory
for
moment
by
moment
i
felt
my
resolution
my
manliness
my
mere
physical
courage
slipping
away
but
the
apparition
did
not
stir
impassive
remorseless
sinister
it
was
content
to
wait
well
aware
that
all
suspense
was
in
its
favour
then
i
said
to
myself
that
i
would
cross
the
room
and
so
attain
my
object
i
made
a
step
and
drew
back
frightened
by
the
sound
of
a
creaking
board
absurd
but
it
was
quite
a
minute
before
i
dared
to
move
another
step
i
had
meant
to
walk
straight
across
to
the
other
door
passing
in
my
course
close
by
the
occupied
chair
i
did
do
not
so
i
kept
round
by
the
wall
creeping
on
tiptoe
and
my
eye
never
leaving
the
figure
in
the
chair
i
did
this
in
spite
of
myself
and
the
manner
of
my
action
was
the
first
hint
of
my
ultimate
defeat
at
length
i
stood
in
the
doorway
leading
to
the
bedroom
i
could
feel
the
perspiration
on
my
forehead
and
at
the
back
of
my
neck
i
fronted
the
inscrutable
white
face
of
lord
clarenceux
the
lover
of
rosetta
rosa
i
met
its
awful
eyes
dark
invidious
fateful
ah
those
eyes
even
in
my
terror
i
could
read
in
them
all
the
history
and
the
characteristics
of
lord
clarenceux
they
were
the
eyes
of
one
who
could
be
of
the
highest
and
the
lowest
mingled
in
their
hardness
was
a
melting
softness
with
their
cruelty
a
large
benevolence
with
their
hate
a
pitying
tenderness
with
their
spirituality
a
hellish
turpitude
they
were
the
eyes
of
two
opposite
men
and
as
i
gazed
into
them
they
reconciled
for
me
the
conflicting
accounts
of
lord
clarenceux
which
i
had
heard
from
different
people
but
as
far
as
i
was
concerned
that
night
the
eyes
held
nothing
but
cruelty
and
disaster
though
i
could
detect
in
them
the
other
qualities
these
qualities
were
not
for
me
we
faced
each
other
the
apparition
and
i
and
the
struggle
silent
and
bitter
as
the
grave
began
neither
of
us
moved
my
arms
were
folded
easily
but
my
nails
pressed
into
the
palms
of
my
clenched
hands
my
teeth
were
set
my
lips
tight
together
my
glance
unswerving
by
sheer
strength
of
endeavour
i
cast
aside
my
fear
of
defeat
and
in
my
heart
i
said
with
the
profoundest
conviction
that
i
would
love
rosa
though
the
seven
seas
and
all
the
continents
give
up
their
dead
to
frighten
me
so
we
remained
for
how
long
i
do
not
know
it
may
have
been
only
minutes
i
can
not
tell
then
gradually
there
came
over
me
a
feeling
that
the
ghost
in
the
chair
was
growing
larger
the
ghastly
inhuman
sneer
on
his
thin
widening
lips
assaulted
me
like
a
giant
malediction
and
the
light
in
the
room
seemed
to
become
more
brilliant
till
it
was
almost
blinding
this
went
on
for
a
time
and
once
more
i
pulled
myself
together
collected
my
scattering
senses
and
seized
again
the
courage
of
determination
which
had
nearly
slipped
from
me
but
i
knew
that
i
must
get
away
out
of
sight
of
this
moveless
and
diabolic
figure
which
did
not
speak
but
which
made
known
its
commands
by
means
of
its
eyes
resign
her
the
eyes
said
tear
your
love
for
her
out
of
your
heart
swear
that
you
will
never
see
her
again
or
i
will
ruin
you
utterly
not
now
only
but
for
evermore
i
think
i
trembled
my
eyes
answered
no
for
some
reason
which
i
can
not
at
all
explain
i
suddenly
took
off
my
overcoat
and
drawing
aside
the
screen
which
ran
across
the
corner
of
the
room
at
my
right
hand
forming
a
primitive
sort
of
wardrobe
i
hung
it
on
one
of
the
hooks
i
had
to
feel
with
my
fingers
for
the
hook
because
i
kept
my
gaze
on
the
figure
i
will
go
into
the
bedroom
i
said
and
i
turned
to
pass
through
the
doorway
then
i
stopped
if
i
did
so
the
eyes
of
the
ghost
would
be
upon
my
back
and
i
felt
that
i
could
only
withstand
that
glance
by
meeting
it
to
have
it
on
my
back
doubtless
i
was
going
mad
however
i
went
backwards
to
the
doorway
and
then
rapidly
stepped
out
of
sight
of
the
apparition
and
sat
down
upon
the
bed
useless
i
must
return
the
mere
idea
of
the
empty
empty
with
the
ghost
in
it
filled
me
with
a
new
and
considerable
fear
horrible
happenings
might
occur
in
that
room
and
i
must
be
there
to
see
them
moreover
the
ghost
gaze
must
now
fall
on
nothing
that
would
be
too
appalling
without
doubt
i
was
mad
its
gaze
must
meet
something
otherwise
it
would
travel
out
into
space
further
and
further
till
it
had
left
all
the
stars
and
waggled
aimless
in
the
ether
the
notion
of
such
a
calamity
was
unbearable
besides
i
was
hungry
for
that
gaze
my
eyes
desired
those
eyes
if
that
glance
did
not
press
against
them
they
would
burst
from
my
head
and
roll
on
the
floor
and
i
should
be
compelled
to
go
down
on
my
hands
and
knees
and
grope
in
search
for
them
no
no
i
must
return
to
the
and
i
returned
the
gaze
met
mine
in
the
doorway
and
now
there
was
something
novel
in
it
an
added
terror
a
more
intolerable
menace
the
silent
imprecation
so
frightful
that
no
human
being
could
suffer
it
i
sank
to
the
ground
and
as
i
did
so
i
shrieked
but
it
was
a
weird
shriek
sounding
only
within
the
brain
and
in
reply
to
that
unheard
shriek
i
heard
an
unheard
voice
of
the
ghost
crying
yield
i
would
not
yield
crushed
maddened
tortured
i
would
not
yield
i
wanted
to
die
i
felt
that
death
would
be
sweet
and
truly
desirable
and
so
thinking
i
faded
into
a
kind
of
coma
or
rather
a
state
which
was
just
short
of
coma
i
had
not
lost
consciousness
but
i
was
conscious
of
nothing
but
the
gaze
rosa
i
whispered
i
am
beaten
but
my
love
has
not
been
conquered
the
next
thing
i
remember
was
the
paleness
of
the
dawn
at
the
window
the
apparition
had
vanished
for
the
night
and
i
was
alive
but
i
knew
that
i
had
touched
the
skirts
of
death
i
knew
that
after
such
another
night
i
should
die

ghost
a
ix
dr
duthoit
vision
by
arthur
machen
i
knew
a
fine
specimen
of
an
english
abbé
when
i
was
at
school
at
hereford
this
was
dr
duthoit
prebendary
of
per
in
hereford
cathedral
rector
of
st
owen
bookworm
and
chiefly
he
was
a
man
when
i
was
a
little
boy
but
he
suffered
me
to
walk
with
him
in
his
garden
sloping
down
to
the
wye
near
a
pleasaunce
of
the
vicars
choral
reciting
sometimes
the
poems
of
traherne
which
he
had
in
manuscript
but
for
the
most
part
demonstrating
his
progress
in
the
art
of
growing
a
rose
this
was
the
true
work
of
his
life
and
nearly
forty
years
ago
he
could
show
blooms
whose
copper
and
crimson
tints
were
very
near
to
utter
darkness
i
believe
that
his
ideal
was
never
attained
in
absolute
perfection
and
perhaps
the
perfect
end
and
attainment
of
desire
do
not
prove
happiness
down
here
below
after
prebendary
duthoit
and
i
rarely
saw
each
other
and
rarely
wrote
he
was
at
rest
among
his
roses
by
the
quiet
wye
and
i
dashed
to
and
fro
in
wilder
waters
but
each
contrived
to
let
the
other
know
that
he
was
still
alive
and
so
i
was
not
altogether
surprised
to
see
the
prebendary
queer
niggly
writing
on
an
envelope
a
week
or
two
ago
he
said
he
had
heard
of
a
good
deal
to
talk
about
well
with
a
popular
legend
with
which
i
am
understood
to
be
in
some
way
concerned
and
he
thought
that
an
odd
experience
of
his
might
possibly
interest
me
i
do
not
give
the
text
of
his
letter
chiefly
because
it
is
full
of
latin
phrases
which
i
might
be
called
upon
to
translate
but
the
matter
is
as
follows
on
the
august
the
day
of
the
service
at
st
paul
dr
duthoit
was
walking
up
and
down
and
about
that
pleasant
garden
on
slopes
of
the
wye
just
above
the
water
his
gardener
had
prepared
under
direction
and
instruction
a
plot
of
ground
in
a
very
special
manner
i
do
not
gather
the
precise
purpose
of
the
operation
but
it
seems
that
the
soil
had
been
very
fine
and
level
for
a
superficies
of
about
ten
yards
to
this
place
the
prebendary
walked
slowly
and
reflectively
wishing
to
assure
himself
that
his
orders
had
been
accurately
carried
out
the
plot
had
been
perfectly
level
the
night
before
but
dr
duthoit
wanted
to
be
more
than
sure
about
it
but
to
his
extreme
annoyance
when
he
turned
by
the
he
saw
that
the
plot
was
very
far
from
even
he
is
an
old
man
but
his
sight
is
good
and
at
a
distance
of
several
yards
he
could
discern
quite
plainly
that
there
had
been
mischief
the
chosen
plot
was
in
a
disgraceful
state
at
first
the
prebendary
thought
that
the
custos
sandy
had
scaled
the
wire
entanglement
on
the
top
of
the
wall
then
he
felt
inclined
to
consider
the
ruin
done
by
scamp
the
bishop
and
then
going
across
he
put
on
his
spectacles
and
wondered
what
had
been
at
work
for
the
level
which
had
been
so
carefully
established
was
all
undone
at
first
the
doctor
thought
it
was
the
mischief
of
some
random
beast
this
confusion
of
hills
and
valleys
which
had
taken
place
of
the
of
the
night
before
and
then
it
reminded
him
of
the
raised
maps
which
he
had
seen
in
the
diocesan
training
schools
and
then
it
reminded
him
more
distinctly
of
a
sort
of
picture
map
which
had
illustrated
his
morning
paper
a
day
or
two
before
and
then
he
wondered
violently
because
he
saw
that
somebody
had
with
infinite
pains
made
this
garden
plot
of
his
into
an
exact
model
of
gallipoli
peninsula
it
was
all
so
ingenious
and
perfect
that
the
old
clergyman
held
his
wrath
for
the
moment
and
peered
into
this
miniature
intricacy
of
peaks
and
steeps
and
gullies
and
valleys
he
had
scarcely
gathered
himself
together
to
wonder
who
had
had
the
ingenious
impudence
for
the
mischief
when
amazement
once
more
seized
him
for
he
saw
now
stooping
down
that
this
garden
gallipoli
was
swarming
with
life
there
were
hosts
on
it
and
about
it
and
then
dr
duthoit
forgot
all
about
what
we
call
the
realities
and
facts
of
life
forgot
that
this
sort
of
thing
does
not
happen
and
watched
what
was
happening
he
writes
that
queerly
enough
he
lost
all
sense
of
size
he
was
not
a
gulliver
looking
down
upon
lilliput
the
mounds
ten
inches
high
became
to
him
actual
and
lofty
summits
the
tiny
precipices
were
tremendous
and
the
red
ants
swarmed
to
attack
the
black
ants
that
held
the
heights
with
savage
and
desperate
fury
he
says
he
panted
with
excitement
as
he
watched
the
courage
of
the
attack
and
defence
the
savagery
of
the
fighting
the
black
and
red
fell
by
myriads
and
the
doctor
had
persuaded
himself
that
he
observed
amazing
incidents
of
individual
heroism
one
particular
range
seemed
to
be
the
especial
aim
of
the
red
forces
and
they
swarmed
up
victorious
and
held
it
for
a
while
and
then
retreated
the
doctor
could
not
quite
make
out
the
reason
of
this
he
started
violently
when
his
man
called
to
him
roberts
said
he
had
called
for
five
minutes
without
getting
an
answer
and
that
the
dean
was
in
a
hurry
with
only
five
minutes
to
spare
so
the
prebendary
went
into
the
house
in
a
kind
of
dwam
as
the
scots
put
it
and
had
no
notion
of
what
the
dean
had
to
say
and
when
he
got
back
to
the
garden
he
found
his
gardener
smoothing
the
plot
with
a
long
rake
and
raking
in
a
lot
of
dead
ants
with
the
mould
the
gardener
said
it
was
the
boys
but
the
doctor
took
no
notice
and
went
to
the
custos
that
night
and
the
custos
reading
his
paper
a
fortnight
later
began
to
think
that
the
old
prebendary
was
a
prophet
and
the
prebendary
he
ends

letter

this

such

that
his

of

as
nearly
doubled

towards

all
the

in

about

the

made

traveller
of
better

toiled
on

with
increased
activity
that
he
might
make
it
his
quarters
for
the
night
fortunately
for
the
character
and
credit
of
hospitality
his
wife
was
of
an
equally
kind
and
generous
disposition
with
himself
so
that
his
absences
from
home
which
were
frequent
and
sometimes
long
did
not
at
all
affect
the
treatment
of
the
stranger
under
his
roof
or
make
his
welcome
less
cordial
but
the
hospitality
exercised
at
morvane
which
was
the
name
of
farm
sometimes
it
must
be
confessed
led
to
occasional
small
depredations
such
as
the
loss
of
a
pair
of
blankets
a
sheet
or
a
pair
of
stockings
carried
off
by
the
ungrateful
vagabonds
whom
he
sometimes
sheltered
there
were
however
one
pair
of
blankets
abstracted
in
this
way
that
found
their
road
back
to
their
owner
in
rather
a
curious
manner
the
morning
was
thick
and
misty
when
the
thief
in
the
case
alluded
to
decamped
with
his
booty
and
continued
so
during
the
whole
day
so
that
no
object
at
any
distance
however
large
could
be
seen
after
toiling
for
several
hours
under
the
impression
that
he
was
leaving
morvane
far
behind
the
vagabond
who
was
also
a
stranger
in
the
country
approached
a
house
with
the
stolen
blankets
snugly
and
carefully
bundled
on
his
back
and
knocked
at
the
door
with
the
view
of
seeking
a
quarters
as
it
was
now
dusk
the
door
was
opened
but
by
whom
think
you
good
reader
why
by
the
thief
without
knowing
it
had
landed
precisely
at
the
point
from
which
he
had
set
out
being
instantly
recognised
he
was
politely
invited
to
walk
in
to
this
kind
invitation
the
thief
replied
by
throwing
down
the
blankets
and
taking
to
his
heels
thus
making
with
his
own
hands
a
restitution
which
was
very
far
from
being
intended
poor
however
did
not
get
all
his
stolen
blankets
back
in
this
way
this
however
is
a
digression
to
proceed
with
our
tale
one
night
when
was
absent
attending
a
market
at
some
distance
an
elderly
female
appeared
at
the
door
with
the
usual
demand
of
a
lodging
which
with
the
usual
hospitality
of
morvane
was
at
once
complied
with
the
stranger
who
was
a
remarkably
tall
woman
was
dressed
in
widow
weeds
and
of
rather
respectable
appearance
her
deportment
was
grave
even
stern
and
altogether
she
seemed
as
if
suffering
from
some
recent
affliction
during
the
whole
of
the
early
part
of
the
evening
she
sat
before
the
fire
with
her
face
buried
between
her
hands
heedless
of
what
was
passing
around
her
and
was
occasionally
observed
rocking
to
and
fro
with
that
kind
of
motion
that
bespeaks
great
internal
anguish
it
was
noticed
however
that
she
occasionally
stole
a
look
at
those
who
were
in
the
apartment
with
her
and
it
was
marked
by
all
but
whether
this
was
merely
the
effect
of
imagination
for
all
that
there
was
something
singular
and
mysterious
about
the
stranger
or
was
really
the
case
we
can
not
decide
that
in
these
furtive
glances
there
was
a
peculiarly
wild
and
appalling
expression
the
stranger
spoke
none
however
during
the
whole
night
but
continued
from
time
to
time
rocking
to
and
fro
in
the
manner
already
described
neither
could
she
be
prevailed
upon
to
partake
of
any
refreshment
although
repeatedly
pressed
to
do
so
all
invitations
of
this
kind
she
declined
with
a
wave
of
the
hand
or
a
melancholy
yet
determined
inclination
of
the
head
in
words
she
made
no
reply
the
singular
conduct
of
this
woman
threw
a
damp
over
all
who
were
present
they
felt
chilled
they
knew
not
how
and
were
sensible
of
the
influence
of
an
indefinable
terror
for
which
they
could
not
account
for
once
therefore
the
feeling
of
comfort
and
security
of
which
all
were
conscious
who
were
seated
around
cheerful
and
hospitable
hearth
was
banished
and
a
scene
of
awe
and
dread
supplied
its
place
no
one
could
conjecture
who
this
strange
personage
was
whence
she
had
come
nor
whither
she
was
going
nor
were
there
any
means
of
acquiring
this
information
as
it
was
a
rule
of
the
house
one
of
special
points
of
etiquette
that
no
stranger
should
ever
be
questioned
on
such
subjects
all
being
allowed
to
depart
as
they
came
without
question
or
inquiry
there
was
never
anything
more
known
at
morvane
regarding
any
stranger
who
visited
it
than
what
he
himself
chose
to
communicate
under
the
painful
feelings
already
described
the
inmates
of
house
found
with
more
than
usual
satisfaction
the
hour
for
retiring
to
rest
arrive
the
general
attention
being
called
to
this
circumstance
by
the
hostess
everyone
hastened
to
his
appointed
dormitory
with
an
alacrity
which
but
too
plainly
showed
how
glad
they
were
to
escape
from
the
presence
of
the
mysterious
stranger
who
however
also
retired
to
bed
with
the
rest
the
place
appointed
for
her
to
sleep
in
was
the
loft
of
an
outbuilding
as
there
was
no
room
for
her
accommodation
within
the
house
itself
all
the
spare
beds
being
occupied
we
have
already
said
that
was
from
home
on
the
evening
of
which
we
are
speaking
attending
a
market
at
some
distance
he
however
returned
shortly
after
midnight
on
arriving
at
his
own
house
he
was
much
surprised
and
not
a
little
alarmed
to
perceive
a
window
in
one
of
the
outhouses
blazing
with
light
it
was
that
in
which
the
stranger
slept
while
all
around
and
within
the
house
was
as
silent
as
the
tomb
afraid
that
some
accident
from
fire
had
taken
place
he
rode
up
to
the
building
and
standing
up
in
his
stirrups
which
brought
his
head
on
a
level
with
the
window
looked
in
when
a
sight
presented
itself
that
made
even
the
stout
heart
of
beat
with
unusual
violence
in
the
middle
of
the
floor
extended
on
her
pallet
lay
the
mysterious
stranger
surrounded
by
seven
bright
and
shining
lights
arranged
at
equal
distances
three
on
one
side
of
the
bed
three
on
the
other
and
one
at
the
head
gazed
steadily
at
the
extraordinary
and
appalling
sight
for
a
few
seconds
when
three
of
the
lights
suddenly
vanished
in
an
instant
afterwards
two
more
disappeared
and
then
another
there
was
now
only
that
at
the
head
of
the
bed
remaining
when
this
light
had
alone
been
left
saw
the
person
who
lay
on
the
pallet
raise
herself
slowly
up
and
gaze
intently
on
the
portentous
beam
whose
light
showed
to
the
terrified
onlooker
a
ghastly
and
unearthly
countenance
surrounded
with
dishevelled
hair
which
hung
down
in
long
thick
irregular
masses
over
her
pale
clayey
visage
so
as
almost
to
conceal
it
entirely
this
light
like
all
the
others
at
length
suddenly
disappeared
and
with
its
last
gleam
the
person
on
the
couch
sank
down
with
a
groan
that
startled
from
the
trance
of
horror
into
which
the
extraordinary
sight
had
thrown
him
he
was
a
bold
and
fearless
man
however
and
therefore
though
certainly
appalled
by
what
he
had
seen
he
made
no
outcry
nor
evinced
any
other
symptom
of
alarm
he
resolutely
and
calmly
awaited
the
conclusion
of
the
extraordinary
scene
and
when
the
last
light
had
disappeared
he
deliberately
dismounted
led
his
horse
into
the
stable
put
him
up
entered
the
house
without
disturbing
any
one
and
slipped
quietly
into
bed
trusting
that
the
morning
would
bring
some
explanation
of
the
mysterious
occurrence
of
the
night
but
resolving
at
the
same
time
that
if
it
should
not
he
would
mention
the
circumstance
to
no
one
on
awaking
in
the
morning
asked
his
wife
what
strangers
were
in
the
house
and
how
they
were
disposed
of
and
particularly
who
it
was
that
slept
in
the
loft
of
the
outhouse
he
was
told
that
it
was
a
woman
in
widow
dress
of
rather
a
respectable
appearance
but
whose
conduct
had
been
very
singular
inquired
no
further
but
desired
that
the
woman
might
be
detained
till
he
should
see
her
as
he
wished
to
speak
with
her
on
some
one
of
the
domestics
however
going
up
to
her
apartment
shortly
after
to
invite
her
to
breakfast
it
was
found
that
she
was
gone
no
one
could
tell
when
or
where
as
her
departure
had
not
been
seen
by
any
person
about
the
house
baulked
in
his
intention
of
eliciting
some
explanation
of
the
extraordinary
circumstance
of
the
preceding
night
from
the
person
who
seemed
to
have
been
a
party
to
it
became
more
strengthened
in
the
resolution
of
keeping
the
secret
to
himself
although
it
made
an
impression
upon
him
which
all
his
natural
strength
of
mind
could
not
remove
at
this
precise
period
of
our
story
had
three
sons
employed
in
the
herring
fishing
a
favourite
pursuit
in
its
season
because
often
a
lucrative
one
of
those
who
live
upon
or
near
the
coasts
of
the
west
highlands
the
three
brothers
had
a
boat
of
their
own
and
desirous
of
making
their
employment
as
profitable
as
possible
they
though
in
sufficiently
good
circumstances
to
have
hired
assistance
manned
her
themselves
and
with
laudable
industry
performed
all
the
drudgery
of
their
laborious
occupation
with
their
own
hands
their
boat
like
all
the
others
employed
in
the
business
we
are
speaking
of
by
the
natives
of
the
highlands
was
her
name
she
was
called
after
the
betrothed
of
the
elder
of
the
three
brothers
the
of
herrings
as
it
is
called
it
is
well
known
appears
in
different
seasons
in
different
places
sometimes
in
one
loch
or
arm
of
the
sea
sometimes
in
another
in
the
season
to
which
our
story
refers
the
fishing
was
in
the
sound
of
kilbrannan
where
several
scores
of
boats
and
amongst
those
that
of
the
were
busily
employed
in
reaping
the
ocean
harvest
when
the
take
of
herrings
appears
in
this
sound
campbelton
loch
a
harbour
on
the
west
coast
of
scotland
is
usually
made
the
headquarters
a
place
of
rendezvous
of
the
little
herring
fleet
and
to
this
loch
they
always
repair
when
threatened
with
a
boisterous
night
although
it
was
not
always
that
they
could
in
such
circumstances
succeed
in
making
it
such
a
night
as
the
one
alluded
to
was
that
that
succeeded
the
evening
on
which
saw
the
strange
lights
that
form
the
leading
feature
of
our
tale
violent
gusts
of
wind
came
in
rapid
succession
down
the
sound
of
kilbrannan
and
a
skifting
rain
flung
fitfully
but
fiercely
from
the
huge
black
clouds
as
they
hurried
along
before
the
tempest
that
already
raged
above
swept
over
the
face
of
the
angry
sea
and
seemed
to
impart
an
additional
bitterness
to
the
rising
wrath
of
the
incipient
storm
it
was
evident
in
short
that
what
sailors
call
a
dirty
night
was
approaching
and
under
this
impression
the
herring
boats
left
their
station
and
were
seen
in
the
dusk
of
the
evening
in
question
hurrying
towards
campbelton
loch
but
the
storm
had
arisen
in
all
its
fury
long
before
the
desired
haven
could
be
gained
the
little
fleet
was
dispersed
some
succeeded
however
in
making
the
harbour
others
finding
this
impossible
ran
in
for
the
saddle
and
carradale
shores
and
were
fortunate
enough
to
effect
a
landing
all
in
short
with
the
exception
of
one
single
boat
ultimately
contrived
to
gain
a
place
of
shelter
of
some
kind
this
unhappy
exception
was
long
after
all
the
others
had
disappeared
from
the
face
of
the
raging
sea
she
was
seen
struggling
alone
with
the
warring
elements
her
canvas
down
to
within
a
few
feet
of
her
gunwale
and
her
keel
only
at
times
being
visible
the
gallant
brothers
who
manned
her
however
had
not
yet
lost
either
heart
or
hope
although
their
situation
at
this
moment
was
but
too
well
calculated
to
deprive
them
of
both
gravely
and
steadily
and
in
profound
silence
they
kept
each
by
his
perilous
post
and
endeavoured
to
make
the
land
on
the
campbelton
side
but
finding
this
impossible
they
put
about
and
ran
before
the
wind
for
the
island
of
arran
which
lay
at
the
distance
of
about
eight
miles
but
alarmed
as
they
approached
that
rugged
shore
by
the
tremendous
sea
which
was
breaking
on
it
and
which
would
have
instantly
dashed
their
frail
bark
to
pieces
they
again
put
about
and
made
to
windward
while
the
hardy
brothers
were
thus
contending
with
their
fate
a
person
mounted
on
horseback
was
seen
galloping
wildly
along
the
carradale
shore
his
eyes
ever
and
anon
turned
towards
the
struggling
boat
with
a
look
of
despair
and
mortal
agony
it
was
the
hapless
father
of
the
unfortunate
youths
by
whom
she
was
manned
there
were
others
too
of
their
kindred
looking
with
failing
hearts
on
the
dreadful
sight
for
all
felt
that
the
unequal
contest
could
not
continue
long
and
that
the
boat
must
eventually
go
down
amongst
those
who
were
thus
watching
with
intense
interest
and
speechless
agony
the
struggle
of
the
doomed
bark
was
catherine
the
beloved
of
the
elder
of
the
brothers
who
ran
in
wild
distraction
along
the
shore
uttering
the
most
cries
oh
my
duncan
she
exclaimed
stretching
out
her
arms
towards
the
pitiless
sea
oh
my
beloved
my
dearest
come
to
me
or
allow
me
to
come
to
you
that
i
may
perish
with
you
but
duncan
heard
her
not
although
it
was
very
possible
he
might
see
her
as
the
distance
was
not
great
there
were
at
this
moment
also
several
persons
on
horseback
friends
of
the
young
men
galloping
along
the
shore
from
point
to
point
as
the
boat
varied
her
direction
in
the
vain
and
desperate
hope
of
being
able
to
render
though
they
knew
not
how
some
assistance
to
the
sufferers
but
the
distracted
father
urged
on
by
the
wild
energy
of
despair
outrode
them
all
as
they
made
on
one
occasion
for
a
rising
ground
near
carradale
from
whence
a
wider
view
of
the
sea
could
be
commanded
for
this
height
now
pushed
and
gained
it
just
in
time
to
see
his
gallant
sons
with
their
little
bark
buried
in
the
waves
he
had
not
taken
his
station
an
instant
on
the
height
when
went
down
and
all
on
board
perished
the
distracted
father
when
he
had
seen
the
last
of
his
unfortunate
sons
covered
his
eyes
with
his
hands
and
for
a
moment
gave
way
to
the
bitter
agony
that
racked
his
soul
his
manly
breast
heaved
with
emotion
and
that
most
affecting
of
all
sounds
the
audible
sorrowing
of
a
strong
man
might
have
been
heard
at
a
great
distance
it
was
however
of
short
continuance
prayed
to
his
god
to
strengthen
him
in
this
dread
hour
of
trial
and
to
enable
him
to
bear
with
becoming
fortitude
the
affliction
with
which
it
had
pleased
him
to
visit
him
and
the
distressed
man
derived
comfort
from
the
appeal
my
brave
my
beautiful
boys
he
said
you
are
now
with
your
god
and
have
entered
i
trust
on
a
life
of
everlasting
happiness
saying
this
he
rode
slowly
from
the
fatal
spot
from
which
he
had
witnessed
the
death
of
his
children
it
was
at
this
moment
and
while
musing
on
the
misfortune
that
had
befallen
him
that
the
strange
occurrence
of
the
preceding
night
recurred
for
the
first
time
to
mind
it
was
obtruded
on
his
recollection
by
the
force
of
association
can
it
be
possible
he
inquired
of
himself
that
the
appearances
of
last
night
can
have
any
connection
with
the
dreadful
events
of
it
must
be
so
he
said
for
three
of
the
lights
of
my
eyes
three
of
the
guiding
stars
of
my
life
have
been
this
day
extinguished
thus
reasoned
and
in
the
mysterious
lights
which
he
had
seen
he
saw
that
the
doom
of
his
children
had
been
announced
but
there
were
seven
he
recollected
and
his
heart
sunk
within
him
as
he
thought
of
the
three
gallant
boys
who
were
still
spared
to
him
one
of
them
the
youngest
was
at
home
with
himself
the
other
two
were
in
the
army
soldiers
in
the
regiment
which
then
boasted
of
many
privates
of
birth
and
education
however
still
kept
the
appalling
secret
of
the
mysterious
lights
to
himself
and
determined
to
await
with
resignation
the
fulfilment
of
the
destiny
which
had
been
read
to
him
and
which
he
now
felt
convinced
to
be
inevitable
the
gallant
regiment
to
which
sons
belonged
was
at
this
period
abroad
on
active
service
it
was
in
america
and
formed
a
part
of
the
army
which
was
employed
in
resisting
the
encroachments
of
the
french
on
the
british
territories
in
that
quarter
the
had
during
the
campaigns
in
the
western
world
of
that
period
viz
and
distinguished
themselves
in
many
a
sanguinary
contest
for
their
singular
bravery
and
general
good
conduct
and
the
fame
of
their
exploits
rung
through
their
native
glens
and
was
spread
far
and
wide
over
their
hills
and
mountains
for
dear
was
the
honour
of
their
gallant
regiment
to
the
warlike
highlanders
many
accounts
had
arrived
from
time
to
time
in
the
country
of
their
achievements
and
joyfully
were
they
received
but
on
the
very
day
after
the
loss
of
a
low
murmur
began
to
arise
in
that
part
of
the
country
which
is
the
scene
of
our
story
of
some
dreadful
disaster
having
befallen
the
national
regiment
no
one
could
say
of
what
nature
this
calamity
was
but
a
buzz
went
round
whose
ominous
whispering
of
fearful
slaughter
made
the
friends
of
the
absent
soldiers
turn
pale
mothers
and
sisters
wept
and
fathers
and
brothers
looked
grave
and
shook
their
heads
the
rumour
bore
that
though
there
had
been
no
loss
of
honour
there
had
been
a
dreadful
loss
of
life
nay
it
was
said
that
the
regiment
had
made
a
mighty
acquisition
to
its
fame
but
that
it
had
been
dearly
bought
at
length
however
the
truth
arrived
in
a
distinct
and
intelligible
shape
the
and
sanguinary
affair
of
ticonderago
had
been
fought
and
in
that
murderous
contest
the
regiment
which
had
behaved
with
a
gallantry
unmatched
before
in
the
annals
of
war
had
suffered
dreadfully
no
less
than
officers
commissioned
and
and
six
hundred
and
three
privates
having
been
killed
and
wounded
in
that
corps
alone
to
many
a
heart
and
home
in
the
highlands
did
this
disastrous
though
glorious
intelligence
bring
desolation
and
mourning
and
amongst
those
on
whom
it
brought
these
dismal
effects
was
of
morvane
on
the
third
day
after
the
occurrence
of
the
events
related
at
the
outset
of
our
narrative
a
letter
which
had
come
in
the
first
instance
to
a
gentleman
in
the
neighbourhood
and
who
also
had
a
son
in
the
was
put
into
hands
by
a
servant
of
the
former
the
man
looked
feelingly
grave
as
he
delivered
it
and
hurried
away
before
it
was
opened
the
letter
was
sealed
with
black
wax
poor
hand
trembled
as
he
opened
it
it
was
from
the
captain
of
the
company
to
which
his
sons
belonged
informing
him
that
both
had
fallen
in
the
attack
on
ticonderago
there
was
an
attempt
in
the
letter
to
soothe
the
unfortunate
father
feelings
and
to
reconcile
him
to
the
loss
of
his
gallant
boys
in
a
lengthened
detail
of
their
heroic
conduct
during
the
sanguinary
struggle
nobly
said
the
writer
did
your
two
brave
sons
maintain
the
honour
of
their
country
in
the
bloody
strife
both
hugh
and
alister
fell
their
broadswords
in
their
hands
on
the
very
ramparts
of
ticonderago
whither
they
had
fought
their
way
with
a
dauntlessness
of
heart
and
a
strength
of
arm
that
might
have
excited
the
envy
and
admiration
of
the
son
of
fingal
in
this
account
of
the
noble
conduct
of
his
sons
the
father
did
find
some
consolation
thank
god
he
exclaimed
though
in
a
tremulous
voice
my
brave
boys
have
done
their
duty
and
died
as
became
their
name
with
their
swords
in
their
hands
and
their
enemies
in
their
front
but
there
was
one
circumstance
mentioned
in
the
letter
that
affected
the
poor
father
more
than
all
the
rest
this
was
the
intimation
that
the
writer
had
in
his
hands
a
sum
of
money
and
a
gold
brooch
which
his
son
alister
had
bequeathed
the
first
to
his
father
the
latter
to
his
mother
as
a
token
of
remembrance
these
he
said
had
been
deposited
with
him
by
the
young
man
previous
to
the
engagement
under
a
presentiment
that
he
should
fall
when
he
had
finished
the
perusal
of
the
letter
sought
his
wife
whom
he
found
weeping
bitterly
for
she
had
already
learned
the
fate
of
her
sons
on
entering
the
apartment
where
she
was
he
flung
his
arms
around
her
in
an
agony
of
grief
and
choking
with
emotion
exclaimed
that
two
more
of
his
fair
lights
had
been
extinguished
by
the
hand
of
heaven
one
yet
remains
he
said
but
that
too
must
soon
pass
away
from
before
mine
eyes
his
doom
is
sealed
but
god
will
be
done
what
mean
ye
john
said
his
sobbing
wife
struck
with
the
prophetic
tone
of
his
speech
is
the
measure
of
our
sorrows
not
yet
filled
are
we
to
lose
him
too
who
is
now
our
only
stay
my
ian
why
this
foreboding
of
more
evil
and
whence
have
you
it
john
she
said
now
looking
her
husband
steadfastly
in
the
face
and
with
an
expression
of
alarm
that
indicated
that
entire
belief
in
supernatural
intelligence
regarding
coming
events
then
so
general
in
the
highlands
urged
by
his
wife
who
implored
him
to
tell
her
whence
he
had
the
tidings
of
her
ian
approaching
fate
related
to
her
the
circumstance
of
the
mysterious
lights
but
there
were
seven
john
she
said
when
he
had
concluded
how
comes
that
our
children
were
but
six
and
immediately
added
as
if
some
fearful
conviction
had
suddenly
forced
itself
on
her
mind
god
grant
that
the
seventh
light
may
have
meant
me
god
forbid
exclaimed
her
husband
on
whose
mind
a
similar
conviction
with
that
with
which
his
wife
was
impressed
now
obtruded
itself
for
the
first
time
that
conviction
was
that
he
himself
was
indicated
by
the
seventh
light
but
neither
of
the
sorrowing
pair
communicated
their
fears
to
the
other
two
days
subsequent
to
this
the
fair
hair
of
ian
was
seen
floating
on
the
surface
of
a
deep
pool
in
the
water
of
bran
a
small
river
that
ran
past
the
house
of
morvane
by
what
accident
the
poor
boy
had
fallen
into
the
river
was
never
ascertained
but
the
pool
in
which
his
body
was
found
was
known
to
have
been
one
of
his
favourite
fishing
stations
one
only
of
the
mysterious
lights
now
remained
without
its
counterpart
but
this
was
not
long
wanting
ere
the
week
had
expired
was
killed
by
a
fall
from
his
horse
when
returning
from
the
funeral
of
his
son
and
the
symbolical
prophecy
was
fulfilled
and
thus
concludes
the
story
of
the
seven
lights
xi
the
spectral
coach
of
blackadon
you
have
heard
of
such
a
spirit
and
well
you
know
the
superstitious
eld
received
and
did
deliver
to
our
age
this
tale
of
herne
the
hunter
for
a
truth
wives
of
the
old
at
talland
as
seen
from
the
looe
road
its
low
roof
and
grey
walls
peeping
prettily
from
between
the
dense
boughs
of
ash
and
elm
that
environed
it
was
as
picturesque
an
object
as
you
could
desire
to
see
the
seclusion
of
its
situation
was
enhanced
by
the
character
of
the
house
itself
it
was
an
building
erected
apparently
in
an
age
when
asceticism
and
were
more
in
vogue
than
at
present
with
a
stern
disregard
of
the
comfort
of
the
inhabitant
and
in
utter
contempt
of
received
principles
of
taste
as
if
not
secure
enough
in
its
retirement
a
high
wall
enclosing
a
courtelage
in
front
effectually
protected
its
inmates
from
the
prying
passenger
and
only
revealed
the
upper
part
of
the
house
with
its
small
gothic
windows
its
slated
roof
and
heavy
chimneys
partly
hidden
by
the
evergreen
shrubs
which
grew
in
the
enclosure
such
was
it
until
its
removal
a
few
years
since
and
such
was
it
as
it
lay
sweetly
in
the
shadows
of
an
autumnal
evening
one
hundred
and
thirty
years
ago
when
a
stranger
in
the
garb
of
a
country
labourer
knocked
hesitatingly
at
the
wicket
gate
which
conducted
to
the
court
after
a
little
delay
a
appeared
and
finding
that
the
countryman
bore
a
message
to
the
vicar
admitted
him
within
the
walls
and
conducted
him
along
a
paved
passage
to
the
little
low
damp
parlour
where
sat
the
good
man
the
rev
mr
dodge
was
in
many
respects
a
remarkable
man
you
would
have
judged
as
much
of
him
as
he
sat
before
the
fire
in
his
chair
in
an
attitude
of
thought
arranging
it
may
have
been
the
heads
of
his
next
sabbath
discourse
his
heavy
eyebrows
throwing
into
shade
his
spacious
eyes
and
indeed
the
whole
contour
of
his
face
marked
him
as
a
man
of
great
firmness
of
character
and
of
much
moral
and
personal
courage
his
suit
of
sober
black
and
periwig
also
added
to
his
dignity
and
gave
him
an
appearance
of
greater
age
he
was
then
verging
on
sixty
the
time
and
the
place
gave
him
abundant
exercise
for
the
qualities
we
have
mentioned
for
many
of
his
parishioners
obtained
their
livelihood
by
the
contraband
trade
and
were
mostly
men
of
unscrupulous
and
daring
character
little
likely
to
bear
with
patience
reflections
on
the
dishonesty
of
their
calling
nevertheless
the
vicar
was
fearless
in
reprehending
it
and
his
frank
exhortations
were
at
least
listened
to
on
account
of
the
simple
honesty
of
the
man
and
his
kindness
of
heart
the
eccentricity
of
his
life
too
had
a
wonderful
effect
in
procuring
him
the
respect
not
to
say
the
awe
of
a
people
superstitious
in
a
more
than
ordinary
degree
ghosts
in
those
days
had
more
freedom
accorded
them
or
had
more
business
with
the
visible
world
than
at
present
and
the
parson
was
frequently
required
by
his
parishioners
to
draw
from
the
uneasy
spirit
the
dread
secret
which
troubled
it
or
by
the
aid
of
the
solemn
prayers
of
the
church
to
set
it
at
rest
for
ever
mr
dodge
had
a
fame
as
an
exorcist
which
was
not
confined
to
the
bounds
of
his
parish
nor
limited
to
the
age
in
which
he
lived
well
my
good
man
what
brings
you
hither
said
the
clergyman
to
the
messenger
a
letter
may
it
please
your
reverence
from
mr
mills
of
lanreath
said
the
countryman
handing
him
a
letter
mr
dodge
opened
it
and
read
as
follows
my
dear
brother
dodge
i
have
ventured
to
trouble
you
at
the
earnest
request
of
my
parishioners
with
a
matter
of
which
some
particulars
have
doubtless
reached
you
and
which
has
caused
and
is
causing
much
terror
in
my
neighbourhood
for
its
fuller
explication
i
will
be
so
tedious
as
to
recount
to
you
the
whole
of
this
strange
story
as
it
has
reached
my
ears
for
as
yet
i
have
not
satisfied
my
eyes
of
its
truth
it
has
been
told
me
by
men
of
honest
and
good
report
witnesses
of
a
portion
of
what
they
relate
with
such
strong
assurances
that
it
behoves
us
to
look
more
closely
into
the
matter
there
is
in
the
neighbourhood
of
this
village
a
barren
bit
of
moor
which
had
no
owner
or
rather
more
than
one
for
the
lords
of
the
adjoining
manors
debated
its
ownership
between
themselves
and
both
determined
to
take
it
from
the
poor
who
have
for
many
years
past
regarded
it
as
a
common
and
truly
it
is
little
to
the
credit
of
these
gentlemen
that
they
should
strive
for
a
thing
so
worthless
as
scarce
to
bear
the
cost
of
law
and
yet
of
no
mean
value
to
poor
labouring
people
the
two
litigants
however
contested
it
with
as
much
violence
as
if
it
had
been
a
field
of
great
price
and
especially
one
an
old
man
whose
thoughts
should
have
been
less
set
on
earthly
possessions
which
he
was
soon
to
leave
had
so
set
his
heart
on
the
success
of
his
suit
that
the
loss
of
it
a
few
years
back
is
said
to
have
much
hastened
his
death
nor
indeed
after
death
if
current
reports
are
worthy
of
credit
does
he
quit
his
claim
to
it
for
at
his
apparition
is
seen
on
the
moor
to
the
great
terror
of
the
neighbouring
villagers
a
public
path
leads
by
at
no
great
distance
from
the
spot
and
on
divers
occasions
has
the
labourer
returning
from
his
work
been
frightened
nigh
unto
lunacy
by
sight
and
sounds
of
a
very
dreadful
character
the
appearance
is
said
to
be
that
of
a
man
habited
in
black
driving
a
carriage
drawn
by
headless
horses
this
is
i
avow
very
marvellous
to
believe
but
it
has
had
so
much
credible
testimony
and
has
gained
so
many
believers
in
my
parish
that
some
steps
seem
necessary
to
allay
the
excitement
it
causes
i
have
been
applied
to
for
this
purpose
and
my
present
business
is
to
ask
your
assistance
in
this
matter
either
to
reassure
the
minds
of
the
country
people
if
it
be
only
a
simple
terror
or
if
there
be
truth
in
it
to
set
the
troubled
spirit
of
the
man
at
rest
my
messenger
who
is
an
industrious
trustworthy
man
will
give
you
more
information
if
it
be
needed
for
from
report
he
is
acquainted
with
most
of
the
circumstances
and
will
bring
back
your
advice
and
promise
of
assistance
not
doubting
of
your
help
herein
i
do
with
my
very
hearty
commendation
commit
you
to
god
protection
and
blessing
and
am
your
very
loving
brother
abraham
mills
this
remarkable
note
was
read
and
while
the
countryman
sat
watching
its
effects
on
the
parson
countenance
and
was
surprised
that
it
changed
not
from
its
usual
sedate
and
settled
character
turning
at
length
to
the
man
mr
dodge
inquired
are
you
then
acquainted
with
my
good
friend
mills
i
should
know
him
sir
replied
the
messenger
having
been
sexton
to
the
parish
for
fourteen
years
and
being
with
my
family
much
beholden
to
the
kindness
of
the
rector
you
are
also
not
without
some
knowledge
of
the
circumstances
related
in
this
letter
have
you
been
an
to
any
of
those
strange
sights
for
myself
sir
i
have
been
on
the
road
at
all
hours
of
the
night
and
day
and
never
did
i
see
anything
which
i
could
call
worse
than
myself
one
night
my
wife
and
i
were
awoke
by
the
rattle
of
wheels
which
was
also
heard
by
some
of
our
neighbours
and
we
are
all
assured
that
it
could
have
been
no
other
than
the
black
coach
we
have
every
day
such
stories
told
in
the
villages
by
so
many
creditable
persons
that
it
would
not
be
proper
in
a
plain
ignorant
man
like
me
to
doubt
it
and
how
far
asked
the
clergyman
is
the
moor
from
lanreath
about
two
miles
and
please
your
reverence
the
whole
parish
is
so
frightened
that
few
will
venture
far
after
nightfall
for
it
has
of
late
come
much
nearer
the
village
a
man
who
is
esteemed
a
sensible
and
pious
man
by
many
though
an
anabaptist
in
principle
went
a
few
weeks
back
to
the
moor
is
called
blackadon
at
midnight
in
order
to
lay
the
spirit
being
requested
thereto
by
his
neighbours
and
he
was
so
alarmed
at
what
he
saw
that
he
hath
been
somewhat
mazed
ever
since
a
fitting
punishment
for
his
presumption
if
it
hath
not
quite
demented
him
said
the
parson
these
persons
are
like
those
addressed
by
st
chrysostom
fitly
called
the
who
said
wretches
that
ye
be
ye
can
not
expel
a
flea
much
less
a
devil
it
will
be
well
if
it
serves
no
other
purpose
but
to
bring
back
these
stray
sheep
to
the
fold
of
the
church
so
this
story
has
gained
much
belief
in
the
parish
most
believe
it
sir
as
rightly
they
should
what
hath
so
many
witnesses
said
the
sexton
though
there
be
some
chiefly
young
men
who
set
up
for
being
wiser
than
their
fathers
and
refuse
to
credit
it
though
it
be
sworn
to
on
the
book
if
those
things
are
disbelieved
friend
said
the
parson
and
without
inquiry
which
your
disbeliever
is
ever
the
first
to
shrink
from
of
what
worth
is
human
testimony
that
ghosts
have
returned
to
the
earth
either
for
the
discovery
of
murder
or
to
make
restitution
for
other
injustice
committed
in
the
flesh
or
compelled
thereto
by
the
incantations
of
sorcery
or
to
communicate
tidings
from
another
world
has
been
testified
to
in
all
ages
and
many
are
the
accounts
which
have
been
left
us
both
in
sacred
and
profane
authors
did
not
brutus
when
in
asia
as
is
related
by
plutarch
see
just
at
this
moment
the
parson
handmaid
announced
that
a
person
waited
on
him
in
the
kitchen
or
the
good
clergyman
would
probably
have
detailed
all
those
cases
in
history
general
and
biblical
with
which
his
reading
had
acquainted
him
not
much
we
fear
to
the
edification
and
comfort
of
the
sexton
who
had
to
return
to
lanreath
a
long
and
dreary
road
after
nightfall
so
instead
he
directed
the
girl
to
take
him
with
her
and
give
him
such
refreshment
as
he
needed
and
in
the
meanwhile
he
prepared
a
note
in
answer
to
mr
mills
informing
him
that
on
the
morrow
he
was
to
visit
some
sick
persons
in
his
parish
but
that
on
the
following
evening
he
should
be
ready
to
proceed
with
him
to
the
moor
on
the
night
appointed
the
two
clergymen
left
the
lanreath
rectory
on
horseback
and
reached
the
moor
at
eleven
bleak
and
dismal
did
it
look
by
day
but
then
there
was
the
distant
landscape
dotted
over
with
pretty
homesteads
to
relieve
its
desolation
now
nothing
was
seen
but
the
black
patch
of
sterile
moor
on
which
they
stood
nothing
heard
but
the
wind
as
it
swept
in
gusts
across
the
bare
hill
and
howled
dismally
through
a
stunted
grove
of
trees
that
grew
in
a
glen
below
them
except
the
occasional
baying
of
dogs
from
the
farmhouses
in
the
distance
that
they
felt
at
ease
is
more
than
could
be
expected
of
them
but
as
it
would
have
shown
a
lack
of
faith
in
the
protection
of
heaven
which
it
would
have
been
unseemly
in
men
of
their
holy
calling
to
exhibit
they
managed
to
conceal
from
each
other
their
uneasiness
leading
their
horses
they
trod
to
and
fro
through
the
damp
fern
and
heath
with
firmness
in
their
steps
and
upheld
each
other
by
remarks
on
the
power
of
that
great
being
whose
ministers
they
were
and
the
might
of
whose
name
they
were
there
to
make
manifest
still
slowly
and
dismally
passed
the
time
as
they
conversed
and
anon
stopped
to
look
through
the
darkness
for
the
approach
of
their
ghostly
visitor
in
vain
though
the
night
was
as
dark
and
murky
as
ghost
could
wish
the
coach
and
its
driver
came
not
after
a
considerable
stay
the
two
clergymen
consulted
together
and
determined
that
it
was
useless
to
watch
any
longer
for
that
night
but
that
they
would
meet
on
some
other
when
perhaps
it
might
please
his
ghostship
to
appear
accordingly
with
a
few
words
of
they
separated
mr
mills
for
the
rectory
and
mr
dodge
by
a
short
ride
across
the
moor
which
shortened
his
journey
by
half
a
mile
for
the
vicarage
at
talland
the
vicar
rode
on
at
an
ambling
pace
which
his
good
mare
sustained
up
hill
and
down
vale
without
urging
at
the
bottom
of
a
deep
valley
however
about
a
mile
from
blackadon
the
animal
became
very
uneasy
pricked
up
her
ears
snorted
and
moved
from
side
to
side
of
the
road
as
if
something
stood
in
the
path
before
her
the
parson
tightened
the
reins
and
applied
whip
and
spur
to
her
sides
but
the
animal
usually
docile
became
very
unruly
made
several
attempts
to
turn
and
when
prevented
threw
herself
upon
her
haunches
whip
and
spur
were
applied
again
and
again
to
no
other
purpose
than
to
add
to
the
horse
terror
to
the
rider
nothing
was
apparent
which
could
account
for
the
sudden
restiveness
of
his
beast
he
dismounted
and
attempted
in
turns
to
lead
or
drag
her
but
both
were
impracticable
and
attended
with
no
small
risk
of
snapping
the
reins
she
was
remounted
with
great
difficulty
and
another
attempt
was
made
to
urge
her
forward
with
the
like
want
of
success
at
length
the
eccentric
clergyman
judging
it
to
be
some
special
signal
from
heaven
which
it
would
be
dangerous
to
neglect
threw
the
reins
on
the
neck
of
his
steed
which
wheeling
suddenly
round
started
backward
in
a
direction
towards
the
moor
at
a
pace
which
rendered
the
parson
seat
neither
a
pleasant
nor
a
safe
one
in
an
astonishingly
short
space
of
time
they
were
once
more
at
blackadon
by
this
time
the
bare
outline
of
the
moor
was
broken
by
a
large
black
group
of
objects
which
the
darkness
of
the
night
prevented
the
parson
from
defining
on
approaching
this
unaccountable
appearance
the
mare
was
seized
with
fresh
fury
and
it
was
with
considerable
difficulty
that
she
could
be
brought
to
face
this
new
cause
of
fright
in
the
pauses
of

prancing

vicar
discovered
to
his
horror
the
spectacle
of
the
black
coach
and
the
headless

and
terrible
to
relate
his
friend
mr

lying
prostrate
on

little

was

him

call
up
his

lips
the
spectre
shouted

is
come

must

and
forthwith
leaped
into
his

and
disappeared
across
the
moor
the
fury
of
the
mare
now
subsided
and
mr

was
enabled
to
approach
his

who
was
lying
motionless
and
speechless
with
his

buried
in

the

which
had
taken

at

thrown
his

to

we
have
left
him
lying
made
homeward
at
a
furious

not
until
he
had
reached
his
stable
door
the
sound
of
his
hoofs
as
he
galloped
madly
through
the
village
awoke
the
cottagers
many
of
whom
had
been
some
hours
in
their
beds
many
eager
faces
staring
with
affright
gathered
round
the
rectory

added
by
their
various
conjectures
to
the
terror
and
apprehensions
of
the

the
villagers
gathering
courage
as
their
numbers
increased
agreed
to
go
in

of
the
missing

started
off
in
a
compact
body
a
few
on
horseback
but
the
greater
number
on
foot
in
the
direction
of
blackadon
there
they
discovered
their
rector
supported
in
the
arms
of
parson
dodge
and
recovered
so
far
as
to
be
able
to
speak
still
there
was
a
wildness
in
his
eye
and
an
incoherency
in
his
speech
that
showed
that
his
reason
was
at
least
temporarily
unsettled
by
the
fright
in
this
condition
he
was
taken
to
his
home
followed
by

companion

strange
adventure

completely

xiii
the
spectre
bridegroom
by
william
hunt
long
long
ago
a
farmer
named
lenine
lived
in
boscean
he
had
but
one
son
frank
lenine
who
was
indulged
into
waywardness
by
both
his
parents
in
addition
to
the
farm
servants
there
was
one
a
young
girl
nancy
trenoweth
who
especially
assisted
mrs
lenine
in
all
the
various
duties
of
a
small
farmhouse
nancy
trenoweth
was
very
pretty
and
although
perfectly
uneducated
in
the
sense
in
which
we
now
employ
the
term
education
she
possessed
many
native
graces
and
she
had
acquired
much
knowledge
really
useful
to
one
whose
aspirations
would
probably
never
rise
higher
than
to
be
mistress
of
a
farm
of
a
few
acres
educated
by
parents
who
had
certainly
never
seen
the
world
beyond
penzance
her
ideas
of
the
world
were
limited
to
a
few
miles
around
the
but
although
her
book
of
nature
was
a
small
one
it
had
deeply
impressed
her
mind
with
its
influences
the
wild
waste
the
small
but
fertile
valley
the
rugged
hills
with
their
crowns
of
cairns
the
moors
rich
in
the
golden
furze
and
the
purple
heath
the
cliffs
and
the
silver
sands
were
the
pages
she
had
studied
under
the
guidance
of
a
mother
who
conceived
in
the
sublimity
of
her
ignorance
that
everything
in
nature
was
the
home
of
some
spirit
form
the
soul
of
the
girl
was
imbued
with
the
deeply
religious
dye
of
her
mother
mind
whose
religion
was
only
a
sense
of
an
unknown
world
immediately
beyond
our
own
the
elder
nancy
trenoweth
exerted
over
the
villagers
around
her
considerable
power
they
did
not
exactly
fear
her
she
was
too
free
from
evil
for
that
but
they
were
conscious
of
a
mental
superiority
and
yielded
without
complaining
to
her
sway
the
result
of
this
was
that
the
younger
nancy
although
compelled
to
service
always
exhibited
some
pride
from
a
feeling
that
her
mother
was
a
superior
woman
to
any
around
her
she
never
felt
herself
inferior
to
her
master
and
mistress
yet
she
complained
not
of
being
in
subjection
to
them
there
were
so
many
interesting
features
in
the
character
of
this
young
servant
girl
that
she
became
in
many
respects
like
a
daughter
to
her
mistress
there
was
no
broad
line
of
division
in
those
days
in
even
the
manorial
hall
between
the
lord
and
his
domestics
and
still
less
defined
was
the
position
of
the
employer
and
the
employed
in
a
small
farmhouse
consequent
on
this
condition
of
things
frank
lenine
and
nancy
were
thrown
as
much
together
as
if
they
had
been
brother
and
sister
frank
was
rarely
checked
in
anything
by
his
parents
who
were
especially
proud
of
their
son
since
he
was
regarded
as
the
handsomest
young
man
in
the
parish
frank
conceived
a
very
warm
attachment
for
nancy
and
she
was
not
a
little
proud
of
her
lover
although
it
was
evident
to
all
the
parish
that
frank
and
nancy
were
seriously
devoted
to
each
other
the
young
man
parents
were
blind
to
it
and
were
taken
by
surprise
when
one
day
frank
asked
his
father
and
mother
to
consent
to
his
marrying
nancy
the
lenines
had
allowed
their
son
to
have
his
own
way
from
his
youth
up
and
now
in
a
matter
which
brought
into
play
the
strongest
of
human
feelings
they
were
angry
because
he
refused
to
bend
to
their
wills
the
old
man
felt
it
would
be
a
degradation
for
a
lenine
to
marry
a
trenoweth
and
in
the
most
unreasoning
manner
he
resolved
it
should
never
be
the
first
act
was
to
send
nancy
home
to
alsia
mill
where
her
parents
resided
the
next
was
an
imperious
command
to
his
son
never
again
to
see
the
girl
the
commands
of
the
old
are
generally
powerless
upon
the
young
where
the
affairs
of
the
heart
are
concerned
so
were
they
upon
frank
he
who
was
rarely
seen
of
an
evening
beyond
the
garden
of
his
father
cottage
was
now
as
constantly
absent
from
his
home
the
house
which
was
wont
to
be
a
pleasant
one
was
strangely
altered
a
gloom
had
fallen
over
all
things
the
father
and
son
rarely
met
as
friends
the
mother
and
her
boy
had
now
a
feeling
of
reserve
often
there
were
angry
altercations
between
the
father
and
son
and
the
mother
felt
she
could
not
become
the
defender
of
her
boy
in
his
open
acts
of
disobedience
his
bold
defiance
of
his
parents
commands
rarely
an
evening
passed
that
did
not
find
nancy
and
frank
together
in
some
retired
nook
the
holy
well
was
a
favourite
and
here
the
most
solemn
vows
were
made
locks
of
hair
were
exchanged
a
taken
from
the
finger
of
a
corpse
was
broken
when
they
vowed
that
they
would
be
united
either
dead
or
alive
and
they
even
climbed
at
night
the
at
treryn
and
swore
by
the
logan
rock
the
same
strong
vow
time
passed
onward
unhappily
and
as
the
result
of
the
endeavours
to
quench
out
the
passion
by
force
it
grew
stronger
under
the
repressing
power
and
like
imprisoned
steam
eventually
burst
through
all
restraint
nancy
parents
discovered
at
length
that
moonlight
meetings
between
two
untrained
impulsive
youths
had
a
natural
result
and
they
were
now
doubly
earnest
in
their
endeavours
to
compel
frank
to
marry
their
daughter
the
elder
lenine
could
not
be
brought
to
consent
to
this
and
he
firmly
resolved
to
remove
his
son
entirely
from
what
he
considered
the
hateful
influences
of
the
trenoweths
he
resolved
to
go
to
plymouth
to
take
his
son
with
him
and
if
possible
to
send
him
away
to
sea
hoping
thus
to
wean
him
from
his
folly
as
he
considered
this
frank
poor
fellow
with
the
best
intentions
was
not
capable
of
any
sustained
effort
and
consequently
he
at
length
succumbed
to
his
father
and
to
escape
his
persecution
he
entered
a
ship
bound
for
india
and
bade
adieu
to
his
native
land
frank
could
not
write
and
this
happened
in
days
when
letters
could
be
forwarded
only
with
extreme
difficulty
consequently
nancy
never
heard
from
her
lover
a
babe
had
been
born
into
a
troublesome
world
and
the
infant
became
a
real
solace
to
the
young
mother
as
the
child
grew
it
became
an
especial
favourite
with
its
grandmother
the
elder
nancy
rejoiced
over
the
little
prattler
and
forgot
her
cause
of
sorrow
young
nancy
lived
for
her
child
and
on
the
memory
of
its
father
subdued
in
spirit
she
was
but
her
affliction
had
given
force
to
her
character
and
she
had
been
heard
to
declare
that
wherever
frank
might
be
she
was
ever
present
with
him
whatever
might
be
the
temptations
of
the
hour
that
her
influence
was
all
powerful
over
him
for
good
she
felt
that
no
distance
could
separate
their
souls
that
no
time
could
be
long
enough
to
destroy
the
bond
between
them
a
period
of
distress
fell
upon
the
trenoweths
and
it
was
necessary
that
nancy
should
leave
her
home
once
more
and
go
again
into
service
her
mother
took
charge
of
the
babe
and
she
found
a
situation
in
the
village
of
kimyall
in
the
parish
of
paul
nancy
like
her
mother
contrived
by
force
of
character
to
maintain
an
ascendancy
amongst
her
companions
she
had
formed
an
acquaintance
which
certainly
never
grew
into
friendship
with
some
of
the
daughters
of
the
small
farmers
around
these
girls
were
all
full
of
the
superstitions
of
the
time
and
place
the
winter
was
coming
on
and
nearly
three
years
had
passed
away
since
frank
lenine
left
his
country
as
yet
there
was
no
sign
nor
father
nor
mother
nor
maiden
had
heard
of
him
and
they
all
sorrowed
over
his
absence
the
lenines
desired
to
have
nancy
child
but
the
trenoweths
would
not
part
with
it
they
went
so
far
even
as
to
endeavour
to
persuade
nancy
to
live
again
with
them
but
nancy
was
not
at
all
disposed
to
submit
to
their
wishes
it
was
eve
and
two
of
nancy
companions
persuaded
her
no
very
difficult
task
to
go
with
them
and
sow
at
midnight
the
three
maidens
stole
out
unperceived
into
kimyall
to
perform
their
incantation
nancy
was
the
first
to
sow
the
others
being
less
bold
than
she
boldly
she
advanced
saying
as
she
scattered
the
seed
i
sow
thee
grow
thee
and
he
who
will
my
true
love
be
come
after
me
and
shaw
thee
this
was
repeated
three
times
when
looking
back
over
her
left
shoulder
she
saw
lenine
but
he
looked
so
angry
that
she
shrieked
with
fear
and
broke
the
spell
one
of
the
other
girls
however
resolved
now
to
make
trial
of
the
spell
and
the
result
of
her
labours
was
the
vision
of
a
white
coffin
fear
now
fell
on
all
and
they
went
home
sorrowful
to
spend
each
one
a
sleepless
night
november
came
with
its
storms
and
during
one
terrific
night
a
large
vessel
was
thrown
upon
the
rocks
in
bernowhall
cliff
and
beaten
by
the
impetuous
waves
she
was
soon
in
pieces
amongst
the
bodies
of
the
crew
washed
ashore
nearly
all
of
whom
had
perished
was
frank
lenine
he
was
not
dead
when
found
but
the
only
words
he
lived
to
speak
were
begging
the
people
to
send
for
nancy
trenoweth
that
he
might
make
her
his
wife
before
he
died
rapidly
sinking
frank
was
borne
by
his
friends
on
a
litter
to
boscean
but
he
died
as
he
reached
the
his
parents
overwhelmed
in
their
own
sorrows
thought
nothing
of
nancy
and
without
her
knowing
that
lenine
had
returned
the
poor
fellow
was
laid
in
his
last
bed
in
burian
churchyard
on
the
night
of
the
funeral
nancy
went
as
was
her
custom
to
lock
the
door
of
the
house
and
as
was
her
custom
too
she
looked
out
into
the
night
at
this
instant
a
horseman
rode
up
in
hot
haste
called
her
by
name
and
hailed
her
in
a
voice
that
chilled
her
blood
the
voice
was
the
voice
of
lenine
she
could
never
forget
that
and
the
horse
she
now
saw
was
her
sweetheart
favourite
colt
on
which
he
had
often
ridden
at
night
to
alsia
the
rider
was
imperfectly
seen
but
he
looked
very
sorrowful
and
deathly
pale
still
nancy
knew
him
to
be
frank
lenine
he
told
her
that
he
had
just
arrived
home
and
that
the
first
moment
he
was
at
liberty
he
had
taken
horse
to
fetch
his
loved
one
and
to
make
her
his
bride
nancy
excitement
was
so
great
that
she
was
easily
persuaded
to
spring
on
the
horse
behind
him
that
they
might
reach
his
home
before
the
morning
when
she
took
lenine
hand
a
cold
shiver
passed
through
her
and
as
she
grasped
his
waist
to
secure
herself
in
her
seat
her
arm
became
as
stiff
as
ice
she
lost
all
power
of
speech
and
suffered
deep
fear
yet
she
knew
not
why
the
moon
had
arisen
and
now
burst
out
in
a
full
flood
of
light
through
the
heavy
clouds
which
had
obscured
it
the
horse
pursued
its
journey
with
great
rapidity
and
whenever
in
weariness
it
slackened
its
speed
the
peculiar
voice
of
the
rider
aroused
its
drooping
energies
beyond
this
no
word
was
spoken
since
nancy
had
mounted
behind
her
lover
they
now
came
to
trove
bottom
where
there
was
no
bridge
at
that
time
they
dashed
into
the
river
the
moon
shone
full
in
their
faces
nancy
looked
into
the
stream
and
saw
that
the
rider
was
in
a
shroud
and
other
she
now
knew
that
she
was
being
carried
away
by
a
spirit
yet
she
had
no
power
to
save
herself
indeed
the
inclination
to
do
so
did
not
exist
on
went
the
horse
at
a
furious
pace
until
they
came
to
the
shop
near
burian
when
she
knew
by
the
light
from
the
forge
fire
thrown
across
the
road
that
the
smith
was
still
at
his
labours
she
now
recovered
speech
save
me
save
me
save
me
she
cried
with
all
her
might
the
smith
sprang
from
the
door
of
the
smithy
with
a
iron
in
his
hand
and
as
the
horse
rushed
by
caught
the
woman
dress
and
pulled
her
to
the
ground
the
spirit
however
also
seized
dress
in
one
hand
and
his
grasp
was
like
that
of
a
vice
the
horse
passed
like
the
wind
and
nancy
and
the
smith
were
pulled
down
as
far
as
the
old
near
the
churchyard
here
the
horse
for
a
moment
stopped
the
smith
seized
that
moment
and
with
his
hot
iron
burned
off
the
dress
from
the
rider
hand
thus
saving
nancy
more
dead
than
alive
while
the
rider
passed
over
the
wall
of
the
churchyard
and
vanished
on
the
grave
in
which
lenine
had
been
laid
but
a
few
hours
before
the
smith
took
nancy
into
his
shop
and
he
soon
aroused
some
of
his
neighbours
who
took
the
poor
girl
back
to
alsia
her
parents
laid
her
on
her
bed
she
spoke
no
word
but
to
ask
for
her
child
to
request
her
mother
to
give
up
her
child
to
lenine
parents
and
her
desire
to
be
buried
in
his
grave
before
the
morning
light
fell
on
the
world
nancy
had
breathed
her
last
breath
a
horse
was
seen
that
night
to
pass
through
the
like
a
ball
from
a
musket
and
in
the
morning
lenine
colt
was
found
dead
in
bernowhall
cliff
covered
with
foam
its
eyes
forced
from
its
head
and
its
swollen
tongue
hanging
out
of
its
mouth
on
lenine
grave
was
found
the
piece
of
nancy
dress
which
was
left
in
the
spirit
hand
when
the
smith
burnt
her
from
his
grasp
it
is
said
that
one
or
two
of
the
sailors
who
survived
the
wreck
related
after
the
funeral
how
on
the
of
october
at
night
lenine
was
like
one
mad
they
could
scarcely
keep
him
in
the
ship
he
seemed
more
asleep
than
awake
and
after
great
excitement
he
fell
as
if
dead
upon
the
deck
and
lay
so
for
hours
when
he
came
to
himself
he
told
them
that
he
had
been
taken
to
the
village
of
kimyall
and
that
if
he
ever
married
the
woman
who
had
cast
the
spell
he
would
make
her
suffer
the
longest
day
she
had
to
live
for
drawing
his
soul

of
his
body

for

was
one
of

evenings
in

month
of

when
the
decline
of
day
assumes
a
calmness
and
repose
resembling

to

in

of

shone
through
the
windows
in
clear
shafts
of
amber
light
exhibiting

of

which

within
its

radiance
the
dog
lay
barking
in
his
dream
at
her

upon

about

to

peculiar
power
over
females
of
every
species
during
the
period
of
parturition
it
is
unnecessary
to
mention
the
variety
of
charms
which
she
possessed
for
that
obsolete
malady

colic
for
toothache
headaches
or
for
removing
warts
and
taking
motes
out
of
the
eyes
let
it
suffice
to
inform
our
readers
that
she
was
well
stocked
with
them
and
that
in
addition
to
this
she
together
with
her
husband
drank
a
potion
made
up
and
administered
by

for
preventing
for
ever
the
slightest
misunderstanding
or
quarrel
between
man
and
wife
whether
it
produced
this
desirable
object
or
not
our
readers
may
conjecture
when
we
add
that
the
after
having
taken
a
very
liberal
advantage
of
their
generosity
was
immediately
compelled
to
disappear
from
the
neighbourhood
in
order
to
avoid
meeting
with
bartley
who
had
a
sharp
for
him
not
exactly
on
his
own
account
but
in
regard
he
said
that
it
had
no
effect
upon
at
all
at
all
whilst
mary
on
the
other
hand
admitted
its
efficacy
upon
herself
but
maintained
that
was
worse
nor
ever
afther
it
such
was
mary
sullivan
as
she
sat
at
her
own
hearth
quite
alone
engaged
as
we
have
represented
her
what
she
may
have
been
meditating
on
we
can
not
pretend
to
ascertain
but
after
some
time
she
looked
sharply
into
the
backstone
or
hob
with
an
air
of
anxiety
and
alarm
by
and
by
she
suspended
her
knitting
and
listened
with
much
earnestness
leaning
her
right
ear
over
to
the
hob
from
whence
the
sounds
to
which
she
paid
such
deep
attention
proceeded
at
length
she
crossed
herself
devoutly
and
exclaimed
queen
of
saints
about
us
is
it
back
ye
are
well
sure
there
no
use
in

all

she
then
shook
a
little
holy
water
over
the
hob
and
muttered
to
herself
an
irish
charm
or
prayer
against
the
evils
which
crickets
are
often
supposed
by
the
peasantry
to
bring
with
them
and
requested
still
in
the
words
of
the
charm
that
their
presence
might
on
that
occasion
rather
be
a
presage
of
good
fortune
to
man
and

belonging

her

she
then
resumed
her
knitting
occasionally
stopping
as
she
changed
her
needles
to
listen
with
her
ear
set
as
if
she
wished
to
augur
from
the
nature
of
their
chirping
whether
they
came
for
good
or
evil
this
however
seemed
to
be
beyond
her
faculty
of
translating
their
language
for
after
sagely
shaking
her
head
two
or
three
times
she
knit
more
busily
than
before
at
this
moment
the
shadow
of
a
person
passing
the
house
darkened
the
window
opposite
which
she
sat
and
immediately
a
tall
female
of
a
wild
dress
and
aspect
entered
the
kitchen
manhy
dhea
ghud
a
ban
the
blessin
o
goodness
upon
you
dacent
woman
said
mrs
sullivan
addressing
her
in
those
kindly
phrases
so
peculiar
to
the
irish
language
instead
of
making
her
any
reply
however
the
woman
whose
eye
glistened
with
a
wild
depth
of
meaning
exclaimed
in
low
tones
apparently
of
much
anguish
husht

an
i
will

and
as
she
thus
spoke
she
turned
her
face
back
over
her
left
shoulder
as
if
some
invisible
being
dogged
her
steps
and
stood
bending
over
her
manhy

chair
in
to
the
fire
but
any
way
wo
you
sit
down
as
she
ceased
speaking
the
piercing
eye
of
the
strange
woman
became
riveted
on
her
with
a
glare
which
whilst
it
startled
mrs
sullivan
seemed
full
of
an
agony
that
almost
abstracted
her
from
external
life
it
was
not
however
so
wholly
absorbing
as
to
prevent
it
from
expressing
a
marked
interest
whether
for
good
or
evil
in
the
woman
who
addressed
her
so
hospitably
husht
now

she
said
as

and
then
fastening
her
dark
eyes
on
mrs
sullivan
she
smiled
bitterly
and
mysteriously
i
know
you
well
she
said
without
however
returning
the
contained
in
the
usual
reply
to
mrs
sullivan
salutation
i
know
you

mary
sullivan
husht
now
husht

enough
if

had
sense
to

ah
ah
ah
what
this
she
exclaimed
abruptly
with
three
distinct
shrieks
that
seemed
to
be
produced
by
sensations
of
sharp
and
piercing
agony
in
the
name
of
goodness
what
over
you
honest
woman
inquired
mrs
sullivan
as
she
started
from
her
chair
and
ran
to
her
in
a
state
of
alarm
bordering
on
terror
is
it
sick
you
are
the
woman
face
had
got
haggard
and
its
features
distorted
but
in
a
few
minutes
they
resumed
their
peculiar
expression
of
settled
wildness
and
mystery
sick
she
replied
licking
her
parched
lips
awirck
look
look
and
she
pointed
with
a
shudder
that
almost
convulsed
her
whole
frame
to
a
lump
that
rose
on
her
shoulders
this
be
it
what
it
might
was
covered
with
a
red
cloak
closely
pinned
and
tied
with
great
caution
about
her
body
is
here
i
have
it
blessed
mother
exclaimed
mrs
sullivan
tottering
over
to
her
chair
as
finished
a
picture
of
horror
as
the
eye
could
witness
this
friday
the
saints
stand
betwixt
me
an
all
harm
oh
holy
mary
protect
me
an
in
the
name
of
the
father
and
she
forthwith
proceeded
to
bless
herself
which
she
did
thirteen
times
in
honour
of
the
blessed
virgin
and
the
twelve
apostles
ay
it
as
you
see
replied
the
stranger
bitterly
it
is
here
husht
now

i
say
i
will
say
to
her
may

ay
indeed

sullivan

i
wo
i
wo
easy
oh
blessed
saints
easy
and
i
wo
in
the
meantime
mrs
sullivan
had
uncorked
her
bottle
of
holy
water
and
plentifully
bedewed
herself
with
it
as
a
preservative
against
this
mysterious
woman
and
her
dreadful
secret
blessed
mother
above
she
ejaculated
the
and
as
she
spoke
with
the
holy
water
in
the
palm
of
her
hand
she
advanced
cautiously
and
with
great
terror
to
throw
it
upon
the
stranger
and
the
unearthly
thing
she
bore
do
attempt
it
shouted
the
other
in
tones
of
mingled
fierceness
and
terror
do
you
want
to
give
pain
without
keeping
anything
at
all
safer
do
you
know
does
care
about
your
holy
water
but
i
suffer
for
it
an
perhaps
so
would
you
mrs
sullivan
terrified
by
the
agitated
looks
of
the
woman
drew
back
with
affright
and
threw
the
holy
water
with
which
she
intended
to
purify
the
other
on
her
own
person
why
thin
you
lost
crathur
who
or
what
are
you
at
all
do
do
for
the
sake
of
all
the
saints
and
angels
of
heaven
do
come
next
or
near
me
keep
your
distance
but
what
are
you
or
how
did
you
come
to
get
that
thing
you
carry
about
wid
you
ay
indeed
replied
the
woman
bitterly
as
if
i
would
or
could
tell
you
that
i
say
you
woman
you
doing
what
not
right
in
asking
me
a
question
you
ought
not
let
to
cross
your
lips
look
to
yourself
and
what
over
you
the
simple
woman
thinking
her
meaning
literal
almost
leaped
off
her
seat
with
terror
and
turned
up
her
eyes
to
ascertain
whether
or
not
any
dreadful
appearance
had
approached
her
or
hung
over
her
where
she
sat
woman
said
she
i
spoke
you
kind
an
fair
an
i
wish
you
well
but
but
what
replied
the
other
and
her
eyes
kindled
into
deep
and
profound
excitement
apparently
upon
very
slight
grounds
why
hem
nothin
at
all
sure
only
only
what
asked
the
stranger
with
a
face
of
anguish
that
seemed
to
torture
every
feature
out
of
its
proper
lineaments
dacent
woman
said
mrs
sullivan
whilst
the
hair
began
to
stand
with
terror
upon
her
head
sure
it
no
wondher
in
life
that
i
in
a
perplexity
whin
a
is
undher
the
one
roof
wid
me
that
i
want
to
know
anything
at
all
about
it
the
dear
forbid
i
should
but
i
never
hard
of
a
person
bein
tormented
wid
it
as
you
are
i
always
used
to
hear
the
people
say
that
it
thrated
its
friends
well
husht
said
the
woman
looking
wildly
over
her
shoulder
i
not
tell
it
on
myself
i
leave
the
blame
why
will
you
never
pity
me
am
i
to
be
night
and
day
tormented
oh
you
wicked
and
cruel
for
no
reason
thry
said
mrs
sullivan
an
bless
yourself
call
on
god
ah
shouted
the
other
are
you
going
to
get
me
killed
and
as
she
uttered
the
words
a
spasmodic
working
which
must
have
occasioned
great
pain
even
to
torture
became
audible
in
her
throat
her
bosom
heaved
up
and
down
and
her
head
was
bent
repeatedly
on
her
breast
as
if
by
force
do
mention
that
name
said
she
in
my
presence
except
you
mean
to
drive
me
to
utter
distraction
i
mean
she
continued
after
considerable
effort
to
recover
her
former
tone
and
manner
hear
me
with
attention
i
mean
woman
you
mary
sullivan
that
if
you
mention
that
holy
name
you
might
as
well
keep
plunging
sharp
knives
into
my
heart
husht
peace
to
me
for
one
minute
tormentor
spare
me
something
i
in
your
power
will
you
ate
anything
said
mrs
sullivan
poor
crathur
you
look
like
hunger
an
distress
there
enough
in
the
house
blessed
be
them
that
sent
it
an
you
had
betther
thry
an
take
some
nourishment
any
way
and
she
raised
her
eyes
in
a
silent
prayer
of
relief
and
ease
for
the
unhappy
woman
whose
unhallowed
association
had
in
her
opinion
sealed
her
doom
will
i
will
i
oh
she
replied
may
you
never
know
misery
for
offering
it
oh
bring
me
something
some
refreshment
some
food
for
i
dying
with
hunger
mrs
sullivan
who
with
all
her
superstition
was
remarkable
for
charity
and
benevolence
immediately
placed
food
and
drink
before
her
which
the
stranger
absolutely
devoured
taking
care
occasionally
to
secrete
under
the
protuberance
which
appeared
behind
her
neck
a
portion
of
what
she
ate
this
however
she
did
not
by
stealth
but
openly
merely
taking
means
to
prevent
the
concealed
thing
from
being
by
any
possible
accident
discovered
when
the
craving
of
hunger
was
satisfied
she
appeared
to
suffer
less
from
the
persecution
of
her
tormentor
than
before
whether
it
was
as
mrs
sullivan
thought
that
the
food
with
which
she
plied
it
appeased
in
some
degree
its
irritability
or
lessened
that
of
the
stranger
it
was
difficult
to
say
at
all
events
she
became
more
composed
her
eyes
resumed
somewhat
of
a
natural
expression
each
sharp
ferocious
glare
which
shot
from
them
with
such
intense
and
rapid
flashes
partially
disappeared
her
knit
brows
dilated
and
part
of
a
forehead
which
had
once
been
capacious
and
handsome
lost
the
contractions
which
deformed
it
by
deep
wrinkles
altogether
the
change
was
evident
and
very
much
relieved
mrs
sullivan
who
could
not
avoid
observing
it
it
not
that
i
care
much
about
it
if
you
think
it
not
right
o
me
but
it
odd
enough
for
you
to
keep
the
lower
part
of
your
face
muffled
up
in
that
black
cloth
an
then
your
forehead
too
is
covered
down
on
your
face
a
bit
if
they
part
of
the
and
she
shuddered
at
the
thought
between
you
an
anything
that
not
good
hem
i
think
you
do
well
to
throw
thim
off
o
you
an
turn
to
thim
that
can
protect
you
from
everything
that
bad
now
a
scapular
would
keep
all
the
divils
in
hell
from
one
an
if
you
on
looking
at
the
stranger
she
hesitated
for
the
wild
expression
of
her
eyes
began
to
return
do
begin
my
punishment
again
replied
the
woman
make
no
allus
do
make
mention
in
my
presence
of
anything
that
good
husht
husht
it
beginning
easy
now
easy
no
said
she
i
came
to
tell
you
that
only
for
my
breaking
a
vow
i
made
to
this
thing
upon
me
i
be
happy
instead
of
miserable
with
it
i
say
it
a
good
thing
to
have
if
the
person
will
use
this
bottle
she
added
producing
one
as
i
will
direct
them
i
would
wish
for
my
part
replied
mrs
sullivan
to
have
anything
to
do
wid
it
neither
act
nor
part
and
she
crossed
herself
devoutly
on
contemplating
such
an
unholy
alliance
as
that
at
which
her
companion
hinted
mary
sullivan
replied
the
other
i
can
put
good
fortune
and
happiness
in
the
way
of
you
and
yours
it
is
for
you
the
good
is
intended
if
do
get
both
can
and
her
eyes
kindled
as
she
spoke
like
those
of
the
pyrhoness
in
the
moment
of
inspiration
mrs
sullivan
looked
at
her
with
awe
fear
and
a
strong
mixture
of
curiosity
she
had
often
heard
that
the
had
through
means
of
the
person
to
whom
it
was
bound
conferred
wealth
upon
several
although
it
could
never
render
this
important
service
to
those
who
exercised
direct
authority
over
it
she
therefore
experienced
something
like
a
conflict
between
her
fears
and
a
love
of
that
wealth
the
possession
of
which
was
so
plainly
intimated
to
her
the
money
said
she
would
be
one
thing
but
to
have
the
planted
over
a
body
shouldher
och
the
saints
preserve
us
no
not
for
oceans
of
hard
goold
would
i
have
it
in
my
company
one
minnit
but
in
regard
to
the
money
hem
why
if
it
could
be
managed
without
havin
act
or
part
wid
people
would
do
anything
in
reason
and
fairity
you
have
this
day
been
kind
to
me
replied
the
woman
and
that
what
i
ca
say
of
many
dear
help
me
husht
every
door
is
shut
in
my
face
does
not
every
cheek
get
pale
when
i
am
seen
if
i
meet
a
on
the
road
they
turn
into
the
field
to
avoid
me
if
i
ask
for
food
it
to
a
deaf
ear
i
speak
if
i
am
thirsty
they
send
me
to
the
river
what
house
would
shelter
me
in
cold
in
hunger
in
drought
in
storm
and
in
tempest
i
am
alone
and
unfriended
hated
feared
an
avoided
starving
in
the
winter
cold
and
burning
in
the
summer
heat
all
this
is
my
fate
here
and
oh
oh
oh
have
mercy
tormentor
have
mercy
i
will
not
lift
my
thoughts
i
keep
the
paction
but
spare
me
she
turned
round
as
she
spoke
seeming
to
follow
an
invisible
object
or
perhaps
attempting
to
get
a
more
complete
view
of
the
mysterious
being
which
exercised
such
a
terrible
and
painful
influence
over
her
mrs
sullivan
also
kept
her
eye
fixed
upon
the
lump
and
actually
believed
that
she
saw
it
move
fear
of
incurring
the
displeasure
of
what
it
contained
and
a
superstitious
reluctance
harshly
to
thrust
a
person
from
her
door
who
had
eaten
of
her
food
prevented
her
from
desiring
the
woman
to
depart
in
the
name
of
goodness
she
replied
i
will
have
nothing
to
do
wid
your
gift
providence
blessed
be
his
name
has
done
well
for
me
mine
an
it
might
be
right
to
go
beyant
what
it
has
pleased
to
give
me
a
rational
sentiment
i
mean
there
good
sense
in
what
you
say
answered
the
stranger
but
you
need
not
be
afraid
and
she
accompanied
the
expression
by
holding
up
the
bottle
and
kneeling
now
she
added
listen
to
me
and
judge
for
yourself
if
what
i
say
when
i
swear
it
can
be
a
lie
she
then
proceeded
to
utter
oaths
of
the
most
solemn
nature
the
purport
of
which
was
to
assure
mrs
sullivan
that
drinking
of
the
bottle
would
be
attended
with
no
danger
you
see
this
little
bottle
drink
it
oh
for
my
sake
and
your
own
drink
it
it
will
give
wealth
without
end
to
you
and
to
all
belonging
to
you
take
of
it
before
sunrise
and
the
other
half
when
he
goes
down
you
must
stand
while
drinking
it
with
your
face
to
the
east
in
the
morning
and
at
night
to
the
west
will
you
promise
to
do
thus
how
would
drinkin
the
bottle
get
me
money
inquired
mrs
sullivan
who
certainly
felt
a
strong
tendency
of
heart
to
the
wealth
that
i
ca
tell
you
now
nor
would
you
understand
it
even
if
i
could
but
you
will
know
all
when
what
i
say
is
complied
with
keep
your
bottle
dacent
woman
i
wash
my
hands
out
of
it
the
saints
above
guard
me
from
the
timptation
i
sure
it
not
right
for
as
a
sinner
is
gettin
stronger
every
minute
widin
me
keep
it
i
loth
to
bid
any
one
that
o
my
bread
to
go
from
my
hearth
but
if
you
go
i
make
it
worth
your
while
saints
above
what
comin
over
me
in
my
whole
life
i
never
had
such
a
hankerin
afther
money
well
well
but
it
quare
entirely
will
you
drink
it
asked
her
companion
if
it
does
hurt
or
harm
to
you
or
yours
or
anything
but
good
may
what
is
hanging
over
me
be
fulfilled
and
she
extended
a
thin
but
considering
her
years
not
ungraceful
arm
in
the
act
of
holding
out
the
bottle
to
her
kind
entertainer
for
the
sake
of
all
that
good
and
gracious
take
it
without
scruple
it
is
not
hurtful
a
child
might
drink
every
drop
that
in
it
oh
for
the
sake
of
all
you
love
and
of
all
that
love
you
take
it
and
as
she
urged
her
the
tears
streamed
down
her
cheeks
no
no
replied
mrs
sullivan
it
never
cross
my
lips
not
if
it
made
me
as
rich
as
ould
hendherson
that
airs
his
guineas
in
the
sun
for
fraid
they
get
light
by
lyin
past
i
entreat
you
to
take
it
said
the
strange
woman
never
never
once
for
all
i
say
i
wo
so
spare
your
breath
the
firmness
of
the
good
housewife
was
not
in
fact
to
be
shaken
so
after
exhausting
all
the
motives
and
arguments
with
which
she
could
urge
the
accomplishment
of
her
design
the
strange
woman
having
again
put
the
bottle
into
her
bosom
prepared
to
depart
she
had
now
once
more
become
calm
and
resumed
her
seat
with
the
languid
air
of
one
who
has
suffered
much
exhaustion
and
excitement
she
put
her
hand
upon
her
forehead
for
a
few
moments
as
if
collecting
her
faculties
or
endeavouring
to
remember
the
purport
of
their
previous
conversation
a
slight
moisture
had
broken
through
her
skin
and
altogether
notwithstanding
her
avowed
criminality
in
entering
into
an
unholy
bond
she
appeared
an
object
of
deep
compassion
in
a
moment
her
manner
changed
again
and
her
eyes
blazed
out
once
more
as
she
asked
her
alarmed
hostess
again
mary
sullivan
will
you
take
the
gift
that
i
have
it
in
my
power
to
give
you
ay
or
no
speak
poor
mortal
if
you
know
what
is
for
your
own
good
mrs
sullivan
fears
however
had
overcome
her
love
of
money
particularly
as
she
thought
that
wealth
obtained
in
such
a
manner
could
not
prosper
her
only
objection
being
to
the
means
of
acquiring
it
oh
said
the
stranger
am
i
doomed
never
to
meet
with
anyone
who
will
take
the
promise
off
me
by
drinking
of
this
bottle
oh
but
i
am
unhappy
what
it
is
to
fear
ah
ah
and
keep
commandments
had
done
so
in
my
youthful
time
i
would
now
ah
merciful
mother
is
there
no
relief
kill
me
tormentor
kill
me
outright
for
surely
the
pangs
of
eternity
can
not
be
greater
than
those
you
now
make
me
suffer
woman
said
she
and
her
muscles
stood
out
in
extraordinary
energy
woman
mary
sullivan
ay
if
you
should
kill
me
blast
me
where
i
stand
i
will
say
the
word
woman
you
have
daughters
teach
them
to
fear
having
got
so
far
she
stopped
her
bosom
heaved
up
and
down
her
frame
shook
dreadfully
her
eyeballs
became
lurid
and
fiery
her
hands
were
clenched
and
the
spasmodic
throes
of
inward
convulsion
worked
the
white
froth
up
to
her
mouth
at
length
she
suddenly
became
like
a
statue
with
this
wild
supernatural
expression
intense
upon
her
and
with
an
awful
calmness
by
far
more
dreadful
than
excitement
could
be
concluded
by
pronouncing
in
deep
husky
tones
the
name
of
god
having
accomplished
this
with
such
a
powerful
struggle
she
turned
round
with
pale
despair
in
her
countenance
and
manner
and
with
streaming
eyes
slowly
departed
leaving
mrs
sullivan
in
a
situation
not
at
all
to
be
envied
in
a
short
time
the
other
members
of
the
family
who
had
been
out
at
their
evening
employments
returned
bartley
her
husband
having
entered
somewhat
sooner
than
his
three
daughters
from
milking
was
the
first
to
come
in
presently
the
girls
followed
and
in
a
few
minutes
they
sat
down
to
supper
together
with
the
servants
who
dropped
in
one
by
one
after
the
toil
of
the
day
on
placing
themselves
about
the
table
bartley
as
usual
took
his
seat
at
the
head
but
mrs
sullivan
instead
of
occupying
hers
sat
at
the
fire
in
a
state
of
uncommon
agitation
every
two
or
three
minutes
she
would
cross
herself
devoutly
and
mutter
such
prayers
against
spiritual
influences

evil
nature
as
she
could
compose
herself
to
remember
thin
why
do
you
come
to
your
supper
mary
said
the
husband
while
the
sowans
are
warm
brave
and
thick
they
are
this
night
any
way
his
wife
was
silent
for
so
strong
a
hold
had
the
strange
woman
and
her
appalling
secret
upon
her
mind
that
it
was
not
till
he
repeated
his
question
three
or
four
times
raising
his
head
with
surprise
and
asking
eh
thin
mary
what
come
over
you
is
it
unwell
you
are
that
she
noticed
what
he
said
supper
she
exclaimed
unwell
is
a
good
right
i
have
to
be
unwell
i
hope
nothing
bad
will
happen
any
way
feel
my
face
nannie
she
added
addressing
one
of
her
daughters
it
as
cowld
an
wet
as
a
limestone
ay
an
if
you
found
me
a
corpse
before
you
it
would
be
at
all
strange
there
was
a
general
pause
at
the
seriousness
of
this
intimation
the
husband
rose
from
his
supper
and
went
up
to
the
hearth
where
she
sat
turn
round
to
the
light
said
he
why
mary
dear
in
the
name
of
wondher
what
ails
you
for
you
like
a
corpse
sure
enough
ca
you
tell
us
what
has
happened
or
what
put
you
in
such
a
state
why
childhre
the
cowld
sweat
teemin
off
her
the
poor
woman
unable
to
sustain
the
shock
produced
by
her
interview
with
the
stranger
found
herself
getting
more
weak
and
requested
a
drink
of
water
but
before
it
could
be
put
to
her
lips
she
laid
her
head
upon
the
back
of
the
chair
and
fainted
grief
and
uproar
and
confusion
followed
this
alarming
incident
the
presence
of
mind
so
necessary
on
such
occasions
was
wholly
lost
one
ran
here
and
another
there
all
jostling
against
each
other
without
being
cool
enough
to
render
her
proper
assistance
the
daughters
were
in
tears
and
bartley
himself
was
dreadfully
shocked
by
seeing
his
wife
apparently
lifeless
before
him
she
soon
recovered
however
and
relieved
them
from
the
apprehension
of
her
death
which
they
thought
had
actually
taken
place
mary
said
the
husband
something
quare
entirely
has
happened
or
you
would
be
in
this
state
did
any
of
you
see
a
strange
woman
lavin
the
house
a
minute
or
two
before
ye
came
in
she
inquired
no
they
replied
not
a
stim
of
anyone
did
we
see
wurrah
dheelish
no
now
is
it
possible
ye
did
she
then
described
her
but
all
declared
they
had
seen
no
such
person
bartley
whisper
said
she
and
beckoning
him
over
to
her
in
a
few
words
she
revealed
the
secret
the
husband
grew
pale
and
crossed
himself
mother
of
saints
childhre
said
he
a
the
words
were
no
sooner
uttered
than
every
countenance
assumed
the
pallidness
of
death
and
every
right
hand
was
raised
in
the
act
of
blessing
the
person
and
crossing
the
forehead
lianhan
shee
all
exclaimed
in
fear
and
horror
this
day
friday
god
betwixt
us
harm
it
was
now
after
dusk
and
the
hour
had
already
deepened
into
the
darkness
of
a
calm
moonless
summer
night
the
hearth
therefore
in
a
short
time
became
surrounded
by
a
circle
consisting
of
every
person
in
the
house
the
door
was
closed
and
securely
bolted
a
struggle
for
the
safest
seat
took
place
and
to
bartley
shame
be
it
spoken
he
lodged
himself
on
the
hob
within
the
jamb
as
the
most
distant
situation
from
the
fearful
being
known
as
the
the
recent
terror
however
brooded
over
them
all
their
topic
of
conversation
was
the
mysterious
visit
of
which
mrs
sullivan
gave
a
painfully
accurate
detail
whilst
every
ear
of
those
who
composed
her
audience
was
set
and
every
single
hair
of
their
heads
bristled
up
as
if
awakened
into
distinct
life
by
the
story
bartley
looked
into
the
fire
soberly
except
when
the
cat
in
prowling
about
the
dresser
electrified
him
into
a
start
of
fear
which
sensation
went
round
every
link
of
the
living
chain
about
the
hearth
the
next
day
the
story
spread
through
the
whole
neighbourhood
accumulating
in
interest
and
incident
as
it
went
where
it
received
the
touches
embellishments
and
emendations
with
which
it
was
amplified
it
would
be
difficult
to
say
every
one
told
it
forsooth
as
he
heard
it
from
another
but
indeed
it
is
not
improbable
that
those
through
whom
it
passed
were
unconscious
of
the
additions
it
had
received
at
their
hands
it
is
not
unreasonable
to
suppose
that
imagination
in
such
cases
often
colours
highly
without
a
premeditated
design
of
falsehood
fear
and
dread
however
accompanied
its
progress
such
families
as
had
neglected
to
keep
holy
water
in
their
houses
borrowed
some
from
their
neighbours
every
old
prayer
which
had
become
rusty
from
disuse
was
brightened
up
charms
were
hung
about
the
necks
of
cattle
and
gospels
about
those
of
children
crosses
were
placed
over
the
doors
and
windows
no
unclean
water
was
thrown
out
before
sunrise
or
after
dusk
those
prayed
now
who
never
prayed
before
and
those
who
always
prayed
still
prayed
the
more
the
inscrutable
woman
who
caused
such
general
dismay
in
the
parish
was
an
object
of
much
pity
avoided
feared
and
detested
she
could
find
no
rest
for
her
weary
feet
nor
any
shelter
for
her
unprotected
head
if
she
was
seen
approaching
a
house
the
door
and
windows
were
immediately
closed
against
her
if
met
on
the
way
she
was
avoided
as
a
pestilence
how
she
lived
no
one
could
tell
for
none
would
permit
themselves
to
know
it
was
asserted
that
she
existed
without
meat
or
drink
and
that
she
was
doomed
to
remain
possessed
of
life
the
prey
of
hunger
and
thirst
until
she
could
get
some
one
weak
enough
to
break
the
spell
by
drinking
her
hellish
draught
to
taste
which
they
said
would
be
to
change
places
with
herself
and
assume
her
despair
and
misery
there
had
lived
in
the
country
about
six
months
before
her
appearance
in
it
a
man
named
stephenson
he
was
unmarried
and
the
last
of
his
family
this
person
led
a
solitary
and
secluded
life
and
exhibited
during
the
last
years
of
his
existence
strong
symptoms
of
eccentricity
which
for
some
months
before
his
death
assumed
a
character
of
unquestionable
derangement
he
was
found
one
morning
hanging
by
a
halter
in
his
own
stable
where
he
had
under
the
influence
of
his
malady
committed
suicide
at
this
time
the
public
press
had
not
as
now
familiarised
the
minds
of
the
people
to
that
dreadful
crime
and
it
was
consequently
looked
upon
with
an
intensity
of
horror
of
which
we
can
scarcely
entertain
any
adequate
notion
his
farm
remained
unoccupied
for
while
an
acre
of
land
could
be
obtained
in
any
other
quarter
no
man
would
enter
upon
such
unhallowed
premises
the
house
was
locked
up
and
it
was
currently
reported
that
stephenson
and
the
devil
each
night
repeated
the
hanging
scene
in
the
stable
and
that
when
the
former
was
committing
the
hopeless
sin
the
halter
slipped
several
times
from
the
beam
of
the
when
satan
came
in
the
shape
of
a
man
with
a
hollow
voice
and
secured
the
rope
until
stephenson
end
was
accomplished
in
this
stable
did
the
wanderer
take
up
her
residence
at
night
and
when
we
consider
the
belief
of
the
people
in
the
which
were
supposed
to
occur
in
it
we
need
not
be
surprised
at
the
new
features
of
horror
which
this
circumstance
superadded
to
her
character
her
presence
and
appearance
in
the
parish
were
dreadful
a
public
outcry
was
soon
raised
against
her
which
were
it
not
from
fear
of
her
power
over
their
lives
and
cattle
might
have
ended
in
her
death
none
however
had
courage
to
grapple
with
her
or
to
attempt
expelling
her
by
violence
lest
a
signal
vengeance
might
be
taken
on
any
who
dared
to
injure
a
woman
that
could
call
in
the
terrible
aid
of
the
in
this
state
of
feeling
they
applied
to
the
parish
priest
who
on
hearing
the
marvellous
stories
related
concerning
her
and
on
questioning
each
man
closely
upon
his
authority
could
perceive
that
like
most
other
reports
they
were
to
be
traced
principally
to
the
imagination
and
fears
of
the
people
he
ascertained
however
enough
from
bartley
sullivan
to
justify
a
belief
that
there
was
something
certainly
uncommon
about
the
woman
and
being
of
a
cold
phlegmatic
disposition
with
some
humour
he
desired
them
to
go
home
if
they
were
wise
he
shook
his
head
mysteriously
as
he
spoke
and
do
the
woman
no
injury
if
they
did
wish
and
with
this
abrupt
hint
he
sent
them
about
their
business
this
however
did
not
satisfy
them
in
the
same
parish
lived
a
suspended
priest
called
father
philip
who
supported
himself
as
most
of
them
do
by
curing
certain
diseases
of
the
people
miraculously
he
had
no
other
means
of
subsistence
nor
indeed
did
he
seem
strongly
devoted
to
life
or
to
the
pleasures
it
afforded
he
was
not
addicted
to
those
intemperate
habits
which
characterise
blessed
priests
in
general
spirits
he
never
tasted
nor
any
food
that
could
be
termed
a
luxury
or
even
a
comfort
his
communion
with
the
people
was
brief
and
marked
by
a
tone
of
severe
contemptuous
misanthropy
he
seldom
stirred
abroad
except
during
morning
or
in
the
evening
twilight
when
he
might
be
seen
gliding
amidst
the
coming
darkness
like
a
dissatisfied
spirit
his
life
was
an
austere
one
and
his
devotional
practices
were
said
to
be
of
the
most
remorseful
character
such
a
man
in
fact
was
calculated
to
hold
a
powerful
sway
over
the
prejudices
and
superstitions
of
the
people
this
was
true
his
power
was
considered
almost
unlimited
and
his
life
one
that
would
not
disgrace
the
highest
saint
in
the
calendar
there
were
not
wanting
some
persons
in
the
parish
who
hinted
that
father
felix
the
parish
priest
was
himself
rather
reluctant
to
incur
the
displeasure
or
challenge
the
power
of
the
by
driving
its
victim
out
of
the
parish
the
opinion
of
these
persons
was
in
its
distinct
unvarnished
reality
that
father
felix
absolutely
showed
the
white
feather
on
this
critical
occasion
that
he
became
shy
and
begged
leave
to
decline
being
introduced
to
this
intractable
pair
seeming
to
intimate
that
he
did
not
at
all
relish
adding
them
to
the
stock
of
his
acquaintances
father
philip
they
considered
as
a
decided
contrast
to
him
on
this
point
his
stern
and
severe
manner
rugged
and
when
occasion
demanded
daring
they
believed
suitable
to
the
qualities
requisite
for
sustaining
such
an
interview
they
accordingly
waited
on
him
and
after
bartley
and
his
friends
had
given
as
faithful
a
report
of
the
circumstances
as
considering
all
things
could
be
expected
he
told
bartley
he
would
hear
from
mrs
sullivan
own
lips
the
authentic
narrative
this
was
quite
satisfactory
and
what
was
expected
from
him
as
for
himself
he
appeared
to
take
no
particular
interest
in
the
matter
further
than
that
of
allaying
the
ferment
and
alarm
which
had
spread
through
the
parish
plase
your
reverence
said
bartley
she
came
in
to
mary
and
she
alone
in
the
house
and
for
the
matther
o
that
i
believe
she
laid
hands
upon
her
and
tossed
and
tumbled
the
crathur
and
she
but
a
sickly
woman
through
the
four
corners
of
the
house
not
that
mary
lets
an
so
much
for
she
afeard
but
i
know
from
her
way
when
she
spakes
about
her
that
it
thruth
your
reverence
but
did
the
said
one
of
them
put
a
knife
to
her
breast
wid
a
divilish
intintion
of
makin
her
give
the
best
of
atin
an
dhrinkin
the
house
afforded
she
got
the
victuals
to
a
sartinty
replied
bartley
and
my
woman
for
her
pains
for
she
not
the
picture
of
herself
since
everyone
now
told
some
magnified
and
terrible
circumstance
illustrating
the
formidable
power
of
the
when
they
had
finished
the
sarcastic
lip
of
the
priest
curled
into
an
expression
of
irony
and
contempt
his
brow
which
was
naturally
black
and
heavy
darkened
and
a
keen
but
rather
a
eye
shot
forth
a
glance
which
while
it
intimated
disdain
for
those
to
whom
it
was
directed
spoke
also
of
a
dark
and
troubled
spirit
in
himself
the
man
seemed
to
brook
with
scorn
the
degrading
situation
of
a
religious
quack
to
which
some
uncontrollable
destiny
had
doomed
him
i
shall
see
your
wife
said
he
to
bartley
and
after
hearing
the
plain
account
of
what
happened
i
will
consider
what
is
best
to
be
done
with
this
dark
perhaps
unhappy
perhaps
guilty
character
but
whether
dark
or
unhappy
or
guilty
i
for
one
should
not
and
will
not
avoid
her
go
and
bring
me
word
evening
when
i
can
see
her
on
the
following
day
begone
when
they
withdrew
father
philip
paced
his
room
for
some
time
in
silence
and
anxiety
ay
said
he
infatuated
people
sunk
in
superstition
and
ignorance
yet
perhaps
happier
in
your
degradation
than
those
who
in
the
pride
of
knowledge
can
only
look
back
upon
a
life
of
crime
and
misery
what
is
a
sceptic
what
is
an
infidel
men
who
when
they
will
not
submit
to
moral
restraint
harden
themselves
into
scepticism
and
infidelity
until
in
the
headlong
career
of
guilt
that
which
was
first
adopted
to
lull
the
outcry
of
conscience
is
supported
by
the
pretended
pride
of
principle
principle
in
a
sceptic
hollow
and
devilish
lie
would
have
plunged
into
scepticism
had
i
not
first
violated
the
moral
sanctions
of
religion
never
i
became
an
infidel
because
i
first
became
a
villain
writhing
under
a
load
of
guilt
that
which
i
wished
might
be
true
i
soon
forced
myself
to
think
true
and
now
he
here
clenched
his
hands
and
groaned
now
ay
now
and
hereafter
oh
hereafter
why
can
i
not
shake
the
thoughts
of
it
from
my
conscience
religion
christianity
with
all
the
hardness
of
an
infidel
heart
i
feel
your
truth
because
if
every
man
were
the
villain
that
infidelity
would
make
him
then
indeed
might
every
man
curse
god
for
the
existence
bestowed
upon
him
as
i
would
but
dare
not
do
yet
why
can
i
not
believe
alas
why
should
god
accept
an
unrepentant
heart
am
i
not
a
hypocrite
mocking
him
by
a
guilty
pretension
to
his
power
and
leading
the
dark
into
thicker
darkness
then
these
hands
blood
broken
vows
ha
ha
ha
well
go
let
misery
have
its
laugh
like
the
light
that
breaks
from
the
prefer
voltaire
to

sow
the

and
reap
the
whirlwind
as
i

i

and

dark
awaits
me
but
i
broke
the
chain
that
galled
us
yet
it
still
rankles
still
rankles
the
unhappy
man
threw
himself
into
a
chair
in
a
paroxysm
of
frenzied
agony
for
more
than
an
hour
he
sat
in
the
same
posture
until
he
became
gradually
hardened
into
a
stiff
lethargic
insensibility
callous
and
impervious
to
feeling
reason
or
religion
an
awful
transition
from
a
visitation
of
conscience
so
terrible
as
that
which
he
had
just
suffered
at
length
he
arose
and
by
walking
moodily
about
relapsed
into
his
usual
gloomy
and
restless
character
when
bartley
went
home
he
communicated
to
his
wife
father
intention
of
calling
on
the
following
day
to
hear
a
correct
account
of
the
why
thin
said
she
i
glad
of
it
for
i
intinded
myself
to
go
to
him
any
way
to
get
my
new
scapular
consecrated
as
to
come
i
get
a
set
of
gospels
for
the
boys
an
girls
an
he
can
consecrate
all
when
his
hand
in
aroon
bartley
they
say
that
so
holy
that
he
can
do
anything
ay
melt
a
body
off
the
face
o
the
earth
like
snow
off
a
ditch
dear
me
but
the
power
they
have
is
strange
all
out
there
no
use
in
gettin
him
anything
to
ate
or
dhrink
replied
bartley
he
would
take
a
glass
o
whisky
once
in
seven
years

an
as
for

curse
why
it
scorch
thim
to
ashes
as
it
was
generally
known
that
father
philip
was
to
visit
mrs
sullivan
the
next
day
in
order
to
hear
an
account
of
the
mystery
which
filled
the
parish
with
such
fear
a
very
great
number
of
the
parishioners
were
assembled
in
and
about
bartley
long
before
he
made
his
appearance
at
length
he
was
seen
walking
slowly
down
the
road
with
an
open
book
in
his
hand
on
the
pages
of
which
he
looked
from
time
to
time
when
he
approached
the
house
those
who
were
standing
about
it
assembled
in
a
body
and
with
one
consent
uncovered
their
heads
and
asked
his
blessing
his
appearance
bespoke
a
mind
ill
at
ease
his
face
was
haggard
and
his
eyes
bloodshot
on
seeing
the
people
kneel
he
smiled
with
his
usual
bitterness
and
shaking
his
hand
with
an
air
of
impatience
over
them
muttered
some
words
rather
in
mockery
of
the
ceremony
than
otherwise
they
then
rose
and
blessing
themselves
put
on
their
hats
rubbed
the
dust
off
their
knees
and
appeared
to
think
themselves
recruited
by
a
peculiar
accession
of
grace
on
entering
the
house
the
same
form
was
repeated
and
when
it
was
over
the
best
chair
was
placed
for
him
by
mary
own
hands
and
the
fire
stirred
up
and
a
line
of
respect
drawn
within
which
none
was
to
intrude
lest
he
might
feel
in
any
degree
incommoded
my
good
neighbour
said
he
to
mrs
sullivan
what
strange
woman
is
this
who
has
thrown
the
parish
into
such
a
ferment
i
told
she

the
said
the
priest
without
noticing
barny
apology

by
a
why
sir
replied
mary
some
sthrange
bein
from
the
good

or

that
sticks
to
some
persons
there
a
bargain
sir
your
reverence
made
atween

an
the
divil

the
agreement

if

their
place

reverence

betther
nor
myself

why

any
one
that
has
the
power
you
have
he
smiled
again
at
this
in
his
own
peculiar
manner
and
was
proceeding
to
inquire
more
particularly
into
the
nature
of
the
interview
between
them
when
the
noise
of
feet
and
sounds
of
general
alarm
accompanied
by
a
rush
of
people
into
the
house
arrested
his
attention
and
he
hastily
inquired
into
the
cause
of
the
commotion
before
he
could
receive
a
reply
however
the
house
was
almost
crowded
and
it
was
not
without
considerable
difficulty
that
by
the
exertions
of
mrs
sullivan
and
bartley
sufficient
order
and
quiet
were
obtained
to
hear
distinctly
what
was
said
plase
your
reverence
said
several
voices
at
once
they
comin
into
the
very
house
to
us
was
ever
the
likes
seen
an
they
must
know
right
well
sir
that
you
widin
it
who
are
coming
he
inquired
why
the
woman
sir
an
her
the
your
reverence
well
said
he
but
why
should
you
all
appear
so
blanched
with
terror
let
her
come
in
and
we
shall
see
how
far
she
is
capable
of
injuring
her
some
maniac
he
muttered
in
a
low
soliloquy
whom
the
villainy
of
the
world
has
driven
into
derangement
some
victim
to
a
hand
like
m
well
they
say
there
a
providence
yet
such
things
are
permitted
he
sayin
a
prayer
now
observed
one
of
them
have
we
a
good
right
to
be
thankful
that
he
in
the
place
wid
us
while
she
in
it
or
dear
knows
what
harm
she
might
do
us
maybe
the
wind
as
the
latter
speaker
concluded
there
was
a
dead
silence
the
persons
about
the
door
crushed
each
other
backwards
their
feet
set
out
before
them
and
their
shoulders
laid
with
violent
pressure
against
those
who
stood
behind
for
each
felt
anxious
to
avoid
all
danger
of
contact
with
a
being
against
whose
power
even
a
blessed
priest
found
it
necessary
to
guard
himself
by
a
prayer
at
length
a
low
murmur
ran
among
the
people
father
father
he
has
turned
the
corner
after
her
an
they
both
comin
in
immediately
they
entered
but
it
was
quite
evident
from
the
manner
of
the
worthy
priest
that
he
was
unacquainted
with
the
person
of
this
singular
being
when
they
crossed
the
threshold
the
priest
advanced
and
expressed
his
surprise
at
the
throng
of
people
assembled
plase
your
reverence
said
bartley
the
woman
nodding
significantly
towards
her
as
he
spoke
but
without
looking
at
her
person
lest
the
evil
eye
he
dreaded
so
much
might
meet
his
and
give
him
the
blast
the
dreaded
female
on
seeing
the
house
in
such
a
crowded
state
started
paused
and
glanced
with
some
terror
at
the
persons
assembled
her
dress
was
not
altered
since
her
last
visit
but
her
countenance
though
more
meagre
and
emaciated
expressed
but
little
of
the
unsettled
energy
which
then
flashed
from
her
eyes
and
distorted
her
features
by
the
depth
of
that
mysterious
excitement
by
which
she
had
been
agitated
her
countenance
was
still
muffled
as
before
the
awful
protuberance
rose
from
her
shoulders
and
the
same
band
which
mrs
sullivan
had
alluded
to
during
their
interview
was
bound
about
the
upper
part
of
her
forehead
she
had
already
stood
upwards
of
two
minutes
during
which
the
fall
of
a
feather
might
be
heard
yet
none
bade
god
bless
her
no
kind
hand
was
extended
to
greet
her
no
heart
warmed
in
affection
towards
her
on
the
contrary
every
eye
glanced
at
her
as
a
being
marked
with
enmity
towards
god
blanched
faces
and
knit
brows
the
signs
of
fear
and
hatred
were
turned
upon
her
her
breath
was
considered
pestilential
and
her
touch
paralysis
there
she
stood
proscribed
avoided
and
hunted
like
a
tigress
all
fearing
to
encounter
yet
wishing
to
exterminate
her
who
could
she
be
or
what
had
she
done
that
the
finger
of
the
almighty
marked
her
out
for
such
a
fearful
weight
of
vengeance
father
philip
rose
and
advanced
a
few
steps
until
he
stood
confronting
her
his
person
was
tall
his
features
dark
severe
and
solemn
and
when
the
nature
of
the
investigation
about
to
take
place
is
considered
it
need
not
be
wondered
at
that
the
moment
was
to
those
present
one
of
deep
and
impressive
interest
such
as
a
visible
conflict
between
a
supposed
champion
of
god
and
a
supernatural
being
was
calculated
to
excite
woman
said
he
in
his
deep
stern
voice
tell
me
who
and
what
you
are
and
why
you
assume
a
character
of
such
a
repulsive
and
mysterious
nature
when
it
can
entail
only
misery
shame
and
persecution
on
yourself
i
conjure
you
in
the
name
of
him
after
whose
image
you
are
created
to
speak
truly
he
paused
and
the
tall
figure
stood
mute
before
him
the
silence
was
dead
as
death
every
breath
was
hushed
and
the
persons
assembled
stood
immovable
as
statues
still
she
spoke
not
but
the
violent
heaving
of
her
breast
evinced
the
internal
working
of
some
dreadful
struggle
her
face
before
was
pale
it
was
now
ghastly
her
lips
became
blue
and
her
eyes
vacant
speak
said
he
i
conjure
you
in
the
name
of
the
power
by
whom
you
live
it
is
probable
that
the
agitation
under
which
she
laboured
was
produced
by
the
severe
effort
made
to
sustain
the
unexpected
trial
she
had
to
undergo
for
some
minutes
her
struggle
continued
but
having
begun
at
its
highest
pitch
it
gradually
subsided
until
it
settled
in
a
calmness
which
appeared
fixed
and
awful
as
the
resolution
of
despair
with
breathless
composure
she
turned
round
and
put
back
that
part
of
her
dress
which
concealed
her
face
except
the
band
on
her
forehead
which
she
did
not
remove
having
done
this
she
turned
again
and
walked
calmly
towards
father
philip
with
a
deadly
smile
upon
her
thin
lips
when
within
a
step
of
where
he
stood
she
paused
and
riveting
her
eyes
upon
him
exclaimed
who
and
what
am
i
the
victim
of
infidelity
and
you
the
bearer
of
a
cursed
existence
the
scoff
and
scorn
of
the
world
the
monument
of
a
broken
vow
and
a
guilty
life
a
being
scourged
by
the
scorpion
lash
of
conscience
blasted
by
periodical
insanity
pelted
by
the
storm
scorched
by
the
summer
heat
withered
by
starvation
hated
by
man
and
touched
into
my
inmost
spirit
by
the
anticipated
tortures
of
future
misery
i
have
no
rest
for
the
sole
of
my
foot
no
repose
for
a
head
distracted
by
the
contemplation
of
a
guilty
life
i
am
the
unclean
spirit
which
walketh
to
seek
rest
and
findeth
none
i
am
you
have
made
behold
she
added
holding
up
the
bottle
this
failed
and
i
live
to
accuse
you
but
no
you
are
my
husband
though
our
union
was
but
a
guilty
form
and
i
will
bury
that
in
silence
you
thought
me
dead
and
you
flew
to
avoid
punishment
did
you
avoid
it
no
the
finger
of
god
has
written
pain
and
punishment
upon
your
brow
i
have
been
in
all
characters
in
all
shapes
have
spoken
with
the
tongue
of
a
peasant
moved
in
my
natural
sphere
but
my
knees
were
smitten
my
brain
stricken
and
the
wild
malady
which
banishes
me
from
society
has
been
upon
me
for
years
such
i
am
and
such
i
say
have
you
made
me
as
for
you
woman
there
was
nothing
in
this
bottle
but
pure
water
the
interval
of
reason
returned
this
day
and
having
remembered
glimpses
of
our
conversation
i
came
to
apologise
to
you
and
to
explain
the
nature
of
my
unhappy
distemper
and
to
beg
a
little
bread
which
i
have
not
tasted
for
two
days
i
at
times
conceive
myself
attended
by
an
evil
spirit
shaped
out
by
a
guilty
conscience
and
this
is
the
only
familiar
which
attends
me
and
by
it
i
have
been
dogged
into
madness
through
every
turning
of
life
whilst
it
lasts
i
am
subject
to
spasms
and
convulsive
starts
which
are
exceedingly
painful
the
lump
on
my
back
is
the
robe
i
wore
when
innocent
in
my
peaceful
convent
the
intensity
of
general
interest
was
now
transferred
to
father
philip
every
face
was
turned
towards
him
but
he
cared
not
a
solemn
stillness
yet
prevailed
among
all
present
from
the
moment
she
spoke
her
eye
drew
his
with
the
power
of
a
basilisk
his
pale
face
became
like
marble
not
a
muscle
moved
and
when
she
ceased
speaking
his
bloodshot
eyes
were
still
fixed
upon
her
countenance
with
a
gloomy
calmness
like
that
which
precedes
a
tempest
they
stood
before
each
other
dreadful
counterparts
in
guilt
for
truly
his
spirit
was
as
dark
as
hers
at
length
he
glanced
angrily
around
him
well
said
he
what
is
it
now
ye
poor
infatuated
wretches
to
trust
in
the
sanctity
learn
from
me
to
place
the
same
confidence
which
you
place
in
his
and
you
will
not
lean
on
a
broken
reed
father
you
too
witness
my
disgrace
but
not
my
punishment
it
is
pleasant
no
doubt
to
have
a
topic
for
conversation
at
your
conferences
enjoy
it
as
for
you
margaret
if
society
lessen
misery
we
may
be
less
miserable
but
the
band
of
your
order
and
the
remembrance
of
your
vow
is
on
your
forehead
like
the
mark
of
cain
tear
it
off
and
let
it
not
blast
a
man
who
is
the
victim
of
prejudice
still
nay
of
superstition
as
well
as
of
guilt
tear
it
from
my
sight
his
eyes
kindled
fearfully
as
he
attempted
to
pull
it
away
by
force
she
calmly
took
it
off
and
he
immediately
tore
it
into
pieces
and
stamped
upon
the
fragments
as
he
flung
them
on
the
ground
come
said
the
despairing
man
come
there
is
a
shelter
for
you
no
food
and
drink
and
raiment
but
no
peace
as
he
uttered
these
words
in
a
voice
that
sank
to
its
deepest
pitch
he
took
her
hand
and
they
both
departed
to
his
own
residence
the
amazement
and
horror
of
those
who
were
assembled
in
bartley
house
can
not
be
described
our
readers
may
be
assured
that
they
deepened
in
character
as
they
spread
through
the
parish
an
undefined
fear
of
this
mysterious
pair
seized
upon
the
people
for
their
images
were
associated
in
their
minds
with
darkness
and
crime
and
supernatural
communion
the
departing
words
of
father
philip
rang
in
their
ears
they
trembled
and
devoutly
crossed
themselves
as
fancy
again
repeated
the
awful
exclamation
of
the
priest
no
peace
no
peace
when
father
philip
and
his
unhappy
associate
went
home
he
instantly
made
her
a
surrender
of
his
small
property
but
with
difficulty
did
he
command
sufficient
calmness
to
accomplish
even
this
he
was
distracted
his
blood
seemed
to
have
been
turned
to
fire
he
clenched
his
hands
and
he
gnashed
his
teeth
and
exhibited
the
wildest
symptoms
of
madness
about
ten
he
desired
fuel
for
a
large
fire
to
be
brought
into
the
kitchen
and
got
a
strong
cord
which
he
coiled
and
threw
carelessly
on
the
table
the
family
were
then
ordered
to
bed
about
eleven
they
were
all
asleep
and
at
the
solemn
hour
of
twelve
he
heaped
additional
fuel
upon
the
living
turf
until
the
blaze
shone
with
scorching
light
upon
everything
around
dark
and
desolating
was
the
tempest
within
him
as
he
paced
with
agitated
steps
before
the
crackling
fire
she
is
risen
he
exclaimed
the
spectre
of
all
my
crimes
is
risen
to
haunt
me
through
life
i
a
murderer
yet
she
lives
and
my
guilt
is
not
the
less
the
stamp
of
eternal
infamy
is
upon
me
the
finger
of
scorn
will
mark
me
out
the
tongue
of
reproach
will
sting
me
like
that
of
the
serpent
the
deadly
touch
of
shame
will
cover
me
like
a
leper
the
laws
of
society
will
crush
the
murderer
not
the
less
that
his
wickedness
in
blood
has
miscarried
after
that
comes
the
black
and
terrible
tribunal
of
the
almighty
vengeance
of
his
fiery
indignation
hush
what
sounds
are
those
they
deepen
they
deepen
is
it
thunder
it
can
not
be
the
crackling
of
the
blaze
it
thunder
but
it
speaks
only
to
ear
hush
great
god
there
is
a
change
in
my
voice
it
is
hollow
and
supernatural
could
a
change
have
come
over
me
am
i
living
could
i
have
hah
could
i
have
departed
and
am
i
now
at
length
given
over
to
the
worm
that
never
dies
if
it
be
at
my
heart
i
may
feel
it
god
i
am
damned
here
is
a
viper
twined
about
my
limbs
trying
to
dart
its
fangs
into
my
heart
hah
there
are
feet
pacing
in
the
room
too
and
i
hear
voices
i
am
surrounded
by
evil
spirits
who
there
what
are
you
speak
they
are
silent
there
is
no
answer
again
comes
the
thunder
but
perchance
this
is
not
my
place
of
punishment
and
i
will
try
to
leave
these
horrible
spirits
he
opened
the
door
and
passed
out
into
a
small
green
field
that
lay
behind
the
house
the
night
was
calm
and
the
silence
profound
as
death
not
a
cloud
obscured
the
heavens
the
light
of
the
moon
fell
upon
the
stillness
of
the
scene
around
him
with
all
the
touching
beauty
of
a
moonlit
midnight
in
summer
here
he
paused
a
moment
felt
his
brow
then
his
heart
the
palpitations
of
which
fell
audibly
upon
his
ear
he
became
somewhat
cooler
the
images
of
madness
which
had
swept
through
his
stormy
brain
disappeared
and
were
succeeded
by
a
lethargic
vacancy
of
thought
which
almost
deprived
him
of
the
consciousness
of
his
own
identity
from
the
green
field
he
descended
mechanically
to
a
little
glen
which
opened
beside
it
it
was
one
of
those
delightful
spots
to
which
the
heart
clingeth
its
sloping
sides
were
clothed
with
patches
of
wood
on
the
leaves
of
which
the
moonlight
glanced
with
a
soft
lustre
rendered
more
beautiful
by
their
stillness
that
side
on
which
the
light
could
not
fall
lay
in
deep
shadow
which
occasionally
gave
to
the
rocks
and
small
projecting
precipices
an
appearance
of
monstrous
and
unnatural
life
having
passed
through
the
tangled
mazes
of
the
glen
he
at
length
reached
its
bottom
along
which
ran
a
brook
such
as
in
the
description
of
the
poet
in
the
leafy
month
of
june
unto
the
sleeping
woods
all
night
singeth
a
quiet
tune
here
he
stood
and
looked
upon
the
green
winding
margin
of
the
streamlet
but
its
song
he
heard
not
with
the
workings
of
a
guilty
conscience
the
beautiful
in
nature
can
have
no
association
he
looked
up
the
glen
but
its
picturesque
windings
soft
vistas
and
wild
underwood
mingling
with
grey
rocks
and
taller
trees
all
mellowed
by
the
had
no
charms
for
him
he
maintained
a
profound
silence
but
it
was
not
the
silence
of
peace
or
reflection
he
endeavoured
to
recall
the
scenes
of
the
past
day
but
could
not
bring
them
back
to
his
memory
even
the
fiery
tide
of
thought
which
like
burning
lava
seared
his
brain
a
few
moments
before
was
now
cold
and
hardened
he
could
remember
nothing
the
convulsion
of
his
mind
was
over
and
his
faculties
were
impotent
and
collapsed
in
this
state
he
unconsciously
retraced
his
steps
and
had
again
reached
the
paddock
adjoining
his
house
when
as
he
thought
the
figure
of
his
paramour
stood
before
him
in
a
moment
his
former
paroxysm
returned
and
with
it
the
gloomy
images
of
a
guilty
mind
charged
with
the
extravagant
horrors
of
madness
what
he
exclaimed
the
band
still
on
your
forehead
tear
it
off
he
caught
at
the
form
as
he
spoke
but
there
was
no
resistance
to
his
grasp
on
looking
again
towards
the
spot
it
had
ceased
to
be
visible
the
storm
within
him
arose
once
more
he
rushed
into
the
kitchen
where
the
fire
blazed
out
with
fiercer
heat
again
he
imagined
that
the
thunder
came
to
his
ears
but
the
thunderings
which
he
heard
were
only
the
voice
of
conscience
again
his
own
footsteps
and
his
voice
sounded
in
his
fancy
as
the
footsteps
and
voices
of
fiends
with
which
his
imagination
peopled
the
room
his
state
and
his
existence
seemed
to
him
a
confused
and
troubled
dream
he
tore
his
hair
threw
it
on
the
table
and
immediately
started
back
with
a
hollow
groan
for
his
locks
which
but
a
few
hours
before
had
been
as
black
as
the
raven
wing
were
now
white
as
snow
on
discovering
this
he
gave
a
low
but
frantic
laugh
ha
ha
ha
he
exclaimed
here
is
another
mark
here
is
food
for
despair
silently
but
surely
did
the
hand
of
god
work
this
as
a
proof
that
i
am
hopeless
but
i
will
bear
it
i
will
bear
the
sight
i
now
feel
myself
a
man
blasted
by
the
eye
of
god
himself
ha
ha
ha
food
for
despair
food
for
despair
immediately
he
passed
into
his
own
room
and
approaching
the
beheld
a
sight
calculated
to
move
a
statue
his
hair
had
become
literally
white
but
the
shades
of
his
dark
complexion
now
distorted
by
terror
and
madness
flitted
as
his
features
worked
under
the
influence
of
his
tremendous
passions
into
an
expression
so
frightful
that
deep
fear
came
over
himself
he
snatched
one
of
his
razors
and
fled
from
the
glass
to
the
kitchen
he
looked
upon
the
fire
and
saw
the
white
ashes
lying
around
its
edge
ha
said
he
the
light
is
come
i
see
the
sign
i
am
directed
and
i
will
follow
it
there
is
yet
one
hope
the
immolation
i
shall
be
saved
yet
so
as
by
fire
it
is
for
this
my
hair
has
become
white
the
sublime
warning
for
my
the
colour
of
ashes
white
white
it
is
so
i
will
sacrifice
my
body
in
material
fire
to
save
my
soul
from
that
which
is
eternal
but
i
had
anticipated
the
sign
the
is
accepted
we
must
here
draw
a
veil
over
that
which
ensued
as
the
description
of
it
would
be
both
unnatural
and
revolting
let
it
be
sufficient
to
say
that
the
next
morning
he
was
found
burnt
to
a
cinder
with
the
exception
of
his
feet
and
legs
which
remained
as
monuments
of
perhaps
the
most
dreadful
suicide
that
ever
was
committed
by
man
his
razor
too
was
found
bloody
and
several
clots
of
gore
were
discovered
about
the
hearth
from
which
circumstances
it
was
plain
that
he
had
reduced
his
strength
so
much
by
loss
of
blood
that
when
he
committed
himself
to
the
flames
he
was
unable
even
had
he
been
willing
to
avoid
the
fiery
and
awful
sacrifice
of
which
he
made
himself
the
victim
if
anything
could
deepen
the
impression
of
fear
and
awe
already
so
general
among
the
people
it
was
the
unparalleled
nature
of
his
death
its
circumstances
are
yet
remembered
in
the
parish
and
county
wherein
it
occurred
it
is
no
gentle
reader
and
the
titular
bishop
who
then
presided
over
the
diocese
declared
that
while
he
lived
no
person
bearing
the
unhappy
man
name
should
ever
be
admitted
to
the
clerical
order
the
shock
produced
by
his
death
struck
the
miserable
woman
into
the
utter
darkness
of
settled
derangement
she
survived
him
some
years
but
wandered
about
through
the
province
still
according
to
the
superstitious
belief
of
the
people
tormented
by
the
terrible
enmity
of
the
xvi
the
haunted
cove
by
sir
george
douglas
bart
commonplace
in
itself
and
showing
positive
vulgarity
in
the
style
in
which
its
are
laid
out
clyffe
near
has
yet
one
delightful
feature
of
its
own
to
wit
a
private
bay
to
which
access
is
obtained
by
a
tunnel
seventy
or
eighty
yards
long
cut
through
the
soft
formation
of
the
cliff
from
the
sloping
gardens
above
the
result
is
that
if
you
are
a
visitor
at
clyffe
you
have
your
own
private
bathing
ground
your
own
private
beach
where
the
children
may
play
without
fear
of
being
encroached
upon
unless
indeed
a
boat
should
be
run
in
among
the
rocks
from
seaward
in
the
early
nineties
of
the
last
century
the
only
daughter
of
the
house
of
clyffe
was
engaged
to
be
married
to
a
young
officer
quartered
at
the
military
depot
at
berwick
they
were
a
blameless
but
not
particularly
interesting
couple
and
one
of
their
hobbies
was
to
meet
and
promenade
on
the
smooth
sands
of
clyffe
bay
in
the
brilliant
autumn
moonlight
in
order
to
prevent
possible
intrusion
from
the
sea
the
seaward
end
of
the
tunnel
was
closed
by
a
heavy
iron
gate
and
upon
the
inner
side
of
this
gate
the
lieutenant
was
to
wait
until
his
fiancée
should
steal
forth
bringing
with
her
the
key
which
should
give
access
to
the
beach
it
was
all
very
foolish
and
romantic
no
doubt
for
they
might
have
met
just
as
conveniently
in
the
conservatory
of
clyffe
house
where
their
privacy
would
have
been
equally
respected
and
where
miss
alix
satin
shoes
and
diaphanous
draperies
would
have
exposed
her
to
no
risk
of
a
chill
lovers
are
like
that
however
and
had
they
not
been
so
on
this
occasion
i
should
have
had
no
story
to
tell
like
the
exemplary
swain
he
was
dick
arrived
early
at
the
rendezvous
that
is
to
say
early
in
respect
to
the
time
agreed
upon
though
as
a
matter
of
fact
it
was
nearly
eleven
there
he
lit
a
cigarette
and
approaching
the
heavy
iron
bars
of
the
locked
gate
looked
forth
upon
the
peaceful
scene
beyond
it
was
a
perfect
night
the
harvest
moon
riding
through
fleecy
cloud
aloft
whilst
the
breaking
of
the
sea
between
the
rocky
points
to
right
and
left
was
soothing
in
its
gentle
iteration
dick
had
been
on
parade
extremely
early
that
morning
and
tell
it
not
in
gath
his
eyes
involuntarily
closed
starting
awake
again
he
saw
with
surprise
that
though
alix
had
not
yet
come
forward
he
was
no
longer
alone
no
the
sacred
beach
had
been
invaded
and
a
female
figure
clad
in
light
draperies
was
pacing
slowly
in
the
moonlight
betwixt
himself
and
the
distant
rocks
who
on
earth
could
she
be
and
how
had
she
got
there
were
the
questions
he
asked
himself
his
first
sensation
being
one
of
annoyance
at
so
unexpected
and
so
an
intrusion
but
as
the
moments
passed
and
the
figure
came
more
clearly
into
view
impatience
gave
way
to
curiosity
and
curiosity
to
something
like
awe
what
he
saw
was
the
tall
and
slender
form
of
a
young
girl
whose
hands
were
clasped
in
front
of
her
and
whose
eyes
were
fixed
on
the
ground
in
a
pensive
not
to
say
sorrowful
attitude
clear
as
was
the
moonlight
at
least
in
the
intervals
of
the
moon
passage
through
the
broken
clouds
her
features
were
not
plainly
visible
but
her
every
movement
was
instinct
with
grace
what
could
she
be
doing
there
under
other
circumstances
possibly
dick
might
have
felt
inclined
to
pass
the
gate
and
himself
step
forth
on
to
the
sands
but
besides
that
the
gate
was
locked
he
gradually
became
conscious
of
a
singular
delicacy
or
unwillingness
to
intrude
upon
the
privacy
of
this
solitary
inexplicable
and
impressive
figure
he
was
content
therefore
to
watch
her
noiseless
progress
and
as
he
did
so
even
his
untrained
masculine
eye
seemed
to
note
something
unusual
out
of
date
it
might
be
in
the
fashion
of
her
garments
so
perhaps
might
some
portrait
have
appeared
had
it
stept
down
from
its
frame
against
the
wall
this
however
stirred
him
little
what
he
was
not
prepared
for
was
the
gesture
of
anguish
nay
of
positive
despair
with
which
when
about
opposite
him
the
figure
threw
her
head
back
and
her
arms
aloft
as
if
in
mute
and
agonised
appeal
to
heaven
the
action
was
even
to
look
on
nor
to
a
male
eye
did
it
lose
aught
from
the
fact
that
as
the
moonlight
now
fell
for
the
first
time
on
her
upturned
face
it
showed
it
to
be
deathly
pale
indeed
but
also
exquisitely
lovely
another
moment
or
two
and
the
graceful
and
appealing
form
had
passed
beyond
his
field
of
vision
for
as
the
locked
gate
stood
some
little
way
back
from
the
mouth
of
the
tunnel
his
view
was
restricted
a
short
time
only
though
he
knew
not
exactly
how
long
had
passed
when
alix
stood
beside
him
i
had
some
difficulty
she
archly
explained
in
eluding
prying
eyes
for
an
ardent
lover
dick
greetings
were
perfunctory
after
which
being
still
powerfully
under
the
impression
of
what
he
had
just
seen
he
told
alix
all
about
it
we
shall
soon
see
who
she
is
replied
that
practical
young
lady
as
she
placed
the
heavy
key
in
the
cumbrous
lock
and
i
shall
also
take
leave
to
inform
her
that
this
bit
of
coast
is
strictly
private
and
strictly
private
it
appeared
to
be
when
they
emerged
from
the
tunnel
for
though
their
eyes
swept
the
beach
to
right
and
left
and
though
the
moon
just
then
was
unobscured
they
saw
no
trace
of
any
living
form
she
must
have
landed
from
a
boat
said
alix
but
as
little
trace
of
a
boat
could
they
discover
still
it
was
quite
possible
that
she
might
pass
unobserved
against
the
dark
rocks
so
they
turned
first
to
the
right
then
to
the
left
keeping
a
keen
for
any
sign
of
motion
they
detected
nothing
and
by
this
time
i
am
bound
to
confess
that
a
slightly
uncomplimentary
suspicion
had
more
than
once
crossed
the
brain
of
alix
she
knew
that
as
a
rule
her
dick
was
a
pattern
of
moderation
but
even
the
most
prudent
may
be
liable
to
be
occasionally
overtaken
and
she
recalled
his
having
mentioned
that
this
was
to
be
a
at
the
mess
indeed
it
was
chiefly
upon
that
account
that
the
assignation
had
been
fixed
so
late
this
present
portentous
solemnity
was
certainly
most
unlike
him
was
it
possible
that
the
poor
fellow
had
taken
just
one
more
than
he
could
conveniently
carry
outspoken
by
nature
she
blurted
out
her
suspicion
which
was
strengthened
rather
than
the
reverse
by
the
great
earnestness
with
which
he
repelled
it
less
convinced
than
before
alix
then
exclaimed
look
here
dick
if
as
you
say
the
young
woman
passed
this
way
she
must
have
left
tracks
on
the
smooth
sand
where
do
you
say
the
place
was
with
some
uncertainty
dick
then
led
her
to
what
he
took
to
be
the
place
no
tracks
were
there
he
then
tried
further
back
from
the
mouth
of
the
tunnel
and
with
as
little
success
it
was
true
the
tide
was
coming
up
but
it
could
scarcely
yet
have
reached
footmarks
which
had
been
imprinted
so
far
inshore
as
he
supposed
these
to
have
been
in
a
spirit
of
levity
which
jarred
on
him
alix
now
recommended
her
lover
to
go
back
to
his
quarters
and
have
a
good
sleep
and
then
having
again
passed
through
the
gate
and
pushed
their
way
up
the
tunnel
the
two
young
people
parted
in
something
very
like
a
tiff
dick
did
not
call
at
clyffe
house
the
next
day
and
when
he
called
on
the
day
following
alix
met
him
in
a
complaisant
mood
after
all
she
had
no
wish
to
quarrel
with
him
and
very
soon
she
said
going
back
to
what
you
told
me
you
had
seen
the
other
night
dick
it
occurred
to
me
after
you
were
gone
that
it
fits
in
rather
curiously
with
an
old
story
connected
with
this
place
and
then
at
his
request
she
proceeded
to
tell
him
how
some
thirty
years
ago
her
grandmother
had
had
a
favourite
maid
a
friendless
orphan
girl
named
barbara
to
whom
attached
a
mystery
barbara
was
a
very
lovely
creature
of
refinement
and
education
above
her
station
and
she
had
of
course
numerous
admirers
young
as
she
was
her
discretion
was
faultless
with
the
sole
exception
that
her
native
amiability
and
desire
to
please
sometimes
betrayed
her
into
conduct
which
meant
less
than
her
admirers
wished
to
think
it
did
well
at
last
barbara
became
plighted
to
a
respectable
young
fisherman
of
a
boat
sailing
from
the
greenses
and
though
details
were
vague
it
was
generally
understood
that
as
a
consequence
several
hearts
were
severely
damaged
as
barbara
had
no
relatives
it
was
arranged
by
her
employer
that
she
should
remain
in
her
situation
until
the
and
should
be
married
from
clyffe
house
considerable
preparations
had
also
been
made
to
do
honour
to
the
occasion
when
judge
of
the
consternation
of
the
inmates
of
the
house
upon
the
morning
of
the
barbara
was
not
to
be
found
she
was
believed
to
have
retired
to
rest
on
the
previous
night
as
usual
yet
her
bed
had
not
been
slept
in
nor
although
most
of
her
clothes
were
packed
in
anticipation
of
her
change
of
domicile
had
she
apparently
taken
anything
with
her
nothing
in
the
least
unusual
had
been
observed
in
her
demeanour
nor
could
the
unhappy
bridegroom
suggest
any
possible
motive
for
her
conduct
exhaustive
inquiries
and
exhaustive
search
were
made
but
to
cut
the
story
short
nothing
had
ever
again
been
seen
or
heard
of
the
fair
barbara
to
that
day
her
mistress
who
had
been
sincerely
attached
to
her
had
long
mourned
for
her
and
in
after
times
would
often
sing
her
praises
but
in
order
to
be
quite
candid
it
must
be
acknowledged
that
there
were
others
not
a
few
who
declined
to
believe
that
the
girl
had
come
to
an
untimely
end
and
who
knowing
that
she
had
several
suitors
and
had
sometimes
appeared
uncertain
which
to
favour
preferred
to
think
that
she
had
changed
her
mind
at
the
last
moment
and
deciding
to
throw
over
her
fisherman
had
made
her
escape
from
clyffe
house
during
the
night
to
join
some
more
eligible
swain
this
would
have
been
a
desperate
step
indeed
nor
could
her
conduct
in
withholding
subsequent
explanations
be
absolved
of
heartlessness
but
after
all
she
was
the
sort
of
girl
who
where
no
actual
misconduct
was
involved
might
easily
allow
herself
to
be
and
certainly
the
tangled
skein
of
love
does
sometimes
present
a
knot
which
must
be
cut
rather
than
untied
the
lieutenant
professed
himself
profoundly
interested
in
this
narrative
which
he
and
alix
then
proceeded
to
discuss
in
all
its
bearings
and
more
particularly
of
course
in
its
relation
to
the
figure
seen
by
him
in
the
cove
it
is
true
that
alix
never
quite
believed
in
the
genuineness
of
the
apparition
but
seeing
that
dick
really
wished
to
have
it
taken
seriously
she
decided
tactfully
to
humour
him
and
made
quite
a
nine
days
wonder
of
the
mysterious
occurrence
their
own
was
however
fast
drawing
on
so
they
soon
found
other
things
to
talk
and
think
of
to
be
brief
they
were
in
due
course
married
and
amid
the
cares
and
pleasures
of
wedded
life
the
story
though
not
forgotten
came
to
be
very
seldom
referred
to
so
twenty
years
passed
at
the
end
of
which
time
the
colonel
as
he
now
was
accompanied
by
his
wife
and
several
youngsters
paid
one
of
his
not
very
frequent
visits
to
his
wife
parents
at
clyffe
house
on
the
first
night
of
the
visit
after
dinner
alix
father
had
significantly
recalled
the
story
of
the
maid
barbara
disappearance
and
after
stating
that
the
mystery
had
now
been
finally
cleared
up
had
gone
on
to
relate
the
following
particulars
a
few
days
previously
there
had
lain
at
the
point
of
death
in
the
infirmary
at
berwick
an
aged
fisherman
who
had
long
been
known
in
the
seaport
town
for
his
solitary
habits
and
morose
and
violent
ways
as
death
drew
near
it
became
evident
that
his
mind
was
sorely
troubled
and
to
one
of
the
nurses
or
doctors
who
had
sought
to
comfort
him
he
had
been
led
to
make
the
acknowledgment
that
a
guilty
secret
weighed
upon
his
soul
making
him
fearful
to
confront
his
maker
he
then
told
how
as
a
young
man
he
had
passionately
loved
a
pretty
employed
at
clyffe
house
misled
by
those
smiles
and
that
graciousness
of
manner
which
in
the
guileless
amiability
of
her
nature
the
girl
lavished
upon
all
alike
he
had
for
a
moment
imagined
himself
her
favoured
suitor
how
bitter
then
was
the
blow
and
how
rude
the
awakening
when
he
learned
that
a
younger
brother
of
his
own
a
mere
boy
was
preferred
before
himself
nor
was
it
only
unrequited
love
that
grieved
him
no
he
believed
or
managed
to
persuade
himself
that
an
unfair
advantage
had
been
taken
of
him
by
which
he
had
been
made
the
lovers
dupe
a
silent
man
he
took
no
one
into
his
confidence
but
abode
his
time
until
the
eve
of
the
on
that
day
he
had
accidentally
intercepted
a
note
from
the
girl
barbara
addressed
to
his
brother
in
which
she
had
agreed
to
meet
her
bridegroom
of
the
morrow
in
the
cove
below
clyffe
house
one
hour
before
midnight
to
spend
a
final
hour
together
before
the
momentous
crisis
in
their
lives
instantly
it
had
occurred
to
the
elder
brother
to
use
the
knowledge
gained
from
the
note
in
order
to
make
one
last
desperate
appeal
on
his
own
account
to
the
sweet
girl
he
loved
so
madly
accordingly
he
kept
back
the
missive
and
to
make
assurance
doubly
sure
mixed
a
soporific
drug
with
his
brother
drink
when
the
latter
came
in
from
fishing
then
whilst
the
youngster
slumbered
heavily
he
himself
embarked
in
a
and
unobserved
rowed
quietly
round
the
headland
into
clyffe
cove
where
he
ran
his
boat
into
a
safe
creek
he
knew
of
and
jumped
ashore
poor
barbara
had
come
down
to
the
water
edge
to
meet
the
boat
and
great
was
her
consternation
on
finding
herself
confronted
by
the
wrong
brother
then
an
impassioned
scene
was
enacted
in
which
the
seaman
used
every
means
of
persuasion
known
to
him
to
get
the
girl
to
give
up
his
brother
and
plight
herself
to
him
but
though
alternately
distressed
and
terrified
barbara
had
stood
her
ground
and
gentle
and
yielding
though
she
appeared
to
be
neither
threats
nor
vows
had
had
the
slightest
effect
upon
her
constancy
and
then
of
a
sudden
the
reckless
brother
had
seen
red
if
he
could
not
have
this
girl
to
wife
then
neither
should
another
and
a
moment
later
her
white
form
lay
stretched
upon
the
dark
rocks
at
his
feet
the
sight
brought
him
to
himself
there
was
no
room
for
doubt
that
life
was
extinct
and
if
he
was
to
escape
suspicion
he
must
act
at
once
for
the
summer
night
was
short
and
the
dread
interview
had
lasted
long
he
accordingly
placed
the
body
in
the
boat
and
having
collected
several
heavy
stones
proceeded
to
make
use
of
his
seacraft
by
binding
them
closely
and
firmly
about
the
poor
girl
body
by
means
of
her
clothing
then
he
rowed
out
to
sea
some
mile
or
more
and
there
quietly
dropped
the
body
overboard
such
in
essentials
was
the
story
told
by
the
dying
fisherman
and
so
it
had
come
about
that
the
bride
of
that
fatal
morning
was
never
seen
or
heard
of
more
though
possibly
intended
to
be
regarded
as
confidential
certain
it
is
that
the
confession
had
leaked
out
and
very
soon
became
public
property
for
a
few
days
it
attracted
great
attention
and
then
like
other
more
important
things
which
had
preceded
it
it
ceased
save
very
occasionally
to
be
alluded
to
at
all
but
the
colonel
never
forgot
it
any
more
than
he
ever
forgot
the
lovely
and
inexplicable
vision
which
had
appeared
to
him
for
so
brief
an
interval
in
the
moonlight
on
the
shore
below
clyffe
house
it
is
true
that
he
seldom
referred
to
it
nor
did
that
stately
dame
who
had
once
been
miss
alix
and
who
was
now
believed
to
command
the
regiment
encourage
him
to
do
so
for
she
had
observed
that
he
was
always
most
ready
to
tell
the
story
after
an
exceptionally
good
dinner
and
with
her
high
sense
of
what
was
due
to
his
rank
she
fancied
that
it
made
him
mildly
ridiculous
neither
it
might
be
had
her
earliest
doubts
been
ever
wholly
laid
to
rest
but
members
of
the
fair
sex
when
they
are
practical
are
apt
to
be
very
practical
indeed
xvii
wandering
willie
tale
by
sir
walter
scott
ye
maun
have
heard
of
sir
robert
redgauntlet
of
that
ilk
who
lived
in
these
parts
before
the
dear
years
the
country
will
lang
mind
him
and
our
fathers
used
to
draw
breath
thick
if
ever
they
heard
him
named
he
was
out
wi
the
hielandmen
in
montrose
time
and
again
he
was
in
the
hills
wi
glencairn
in
the
saxteen
hundred
and
and
sae
when
king
charles
the
second
came
in
wha
was
in
sic
favour
as
the
laird
of
redgauntlet
he
was
knighted
at
lonon
court
wi
the
king
ain
sword
and
being
a
redhot
prelatist
he
came
down
here
rampauging
like
a
lion
with
commissions
of
lieutenancy
and
of
lunacy
for
what
i
ken
to
put
down
a
the
whigs
and
covenanters
in
the
country
wild
wark
they
made
of
it
for
the
whigs
were
as
dour
as
the
cavaliers
were
fierce
and
it
was
which
should
first
tire
the
other
redgauntlet
was
aye
for
the
strong
hand
and
his
name
is
kend
as
wide
in
the
country
as
claverhouse
or
tam
dalyell
glen
nor
dargle
nor
mountain
nor
cave
could
hide
the
puir
when
redgauntlet
was
out
with
bugle
and
bloodhound
after
them
as
if
they
had
been
sae
mony
deer
and
troth
when
they
fand
them
they
didna
mak
muckle
mair
ceremony
than
a
hielandman
wi
a
roebuck
it
was
just
will
ye
tak
the
test
if
not
make
ready
present
fire
and
there
lay
the
recusant
far
and
wide
was
sir
robert
hated
and
feared
men
thought
he
had
a
direct
compact
with
satan
that
he
was
proof
against
steel
and
that
bullets
happed
aff
his

and
muckle
to
the

purpose
of
whilk
mair
anon
the
best
blessing
they
wared
on
him
was
deil
scowp
wi
redgauntlet
he
wasna
a
bad
maister
to
his
ain
folk
though
and
was
weel
aneugh
liked
by
his
tenants
and
as
for
the
lackies
and
troopers
that
rade
out
wi
him
to
the
persecutions
as
the
whigs
caa
those
killing
times
they
wad
hae
drunken
themsells
blind
to
his
health
at
ony
time
now
you
are
to
ken
that
my
gudesire
lived
on
redgauntlet
grund
they
ca
the
place
we
had
lived
on
the
grund
and
under
the
redgauntlets
since
the
riding
days
and
lang
before
it
was
a
pleasant
bit
and
i
think
the
air
is
callerer
and
fresher
there
than
ony
where
else
in
the
country
it
a
deserted
now
and
i
sat
on
the
broken
three
days
since
and
was
glad
i
couldna
see
the
plight
the
place
was
in
but
that
a
wide
o
the
mark
there
dwelt
my
gudesire
steenie
steenson
a
rambling
rattling
chiel
he
had
been
in
his
young
days
and
could
play
weel
on
the
pipes
he
was
famous
at
hoopers
and
girders
a
cumberland
couldna
touch
him
at
jockie
lattin
and
he
had
the
finest
finger
for
the
backlilt
between
berwick
and
carlisle
the
like
o
steenie
wasna
the
sort
that
they
made
whigs
o
and
so
he
became
a
tory
as
they
ca
it
which
we
now
ca
jacobites
just
out
of
a
kind
of
needcessity
that
he
might
belang
to
some
side
or
other
he
had
nae
to
the
whig
bodies
and
liked
little
to
see
the
blude
rin
though
being
obliged
to
follow
sir
robert
in
hunting
and
hosting
watching
and
warding
he
saw
muckle
mischief
and
maybe
did
some
that
he
couldna
avoid
now
steenie
was
a
kind
of
favourite
with
his
master
and
kend
a
the
folks
about
the
castle
and
was
often
sent
for
to
play
the
pipes
when
they
were
at
their
merriment
auld
dougal
maccallum
the
butler
that
had
followed
sir
robert
through
gude
and
ill
thick
and
thin
pool
and
stream
was
specially
fond
of
the
pipes
and
aye
gae
my
gudesire
his
gude
word
wi
the
laird
for
dougal
could
turn
his
master
round
his
finger
weel
round
came
the
revolution
and
it
had
like
to
have
broken
the
hearts
baith
of
dougal
and
his
master
but
the
change
was
not
sae
great
as
they
feared
and
other
folk
thought
for
the
whigs
made
an
unco
crawing
what
they
wad
do
with
their
auld
enemies
and
in
special
wi
sir
robert
redgauntlet
but
there
were
ower
mony
great
folks
dipped
in
the
same
doings
to
mak
a
spick
and
span
new
warld
so
parliament
passed
it
a
ower
easy
and
sir
robert
bating
that
he
was
held
to
hunting
foxes
instead
of
covenanters
remained
just
the
man
he
was
his
revel
was
as
loud
and
his
hall
as
weel
lighted
as
ever
it
had
been
though
maybe
he
lacked
the
fines
of
the
nonconformists
that
used
to
come
to
stock
his
larder
and
cellar
for
it
is
certain
he
began
to
be
keener
about
the
rents
than
his
tenants
used
to
find
him
before
and
they
behoved
to
be
prompt
to
the
or
else
the
laird
wasna
pleased
and
he
was
sic
an
awsome
body
that
naebody
cared
to
anger
him
for
the
oaths
he
swore
and
the
rage
that
he
used
to
get
into
and
the
looks
that
he
put
on
made
men
sometimes
think
him
a
devil
incarnate
weel
my
gudesire
was
nae
manager
no
that
he
was
a
very
great
misguider
but
he
hadna
the
saving
gift
and
he
got
twa
terms
rent
in
arrear
he
got
the
first
brash
at
whitsunday
put

the
siller
he
lent
my
gudesire
ower
the
stocking
at
away
trots
my
gudesire
to
redgauntlet
castle
wi
a
heavy
purse
and
a
light
heart
glad
to
be
out
of
the
laird
danger
weel
the
first
thing
he
learned
at
the
castle
was
that
sir
robert
had
fretted
himself
into
a
fit
of
the
gout
because
he
did
not
appear
before
twelve
it
wasna
for
sake
of
the
money
dougal
thought
but
because
he
didna
like
to
part
wi
my
gudesire
aff
the
grund
dougal
was
glad
to
see
steenie
and
brought
him
into
the
great
oak
parlour
and
there
sat
the
laird
his
leesome
lane
excepting
that
he
had
beside
him
a
great
jackanape
that
was
a
special
pet
of
his
a
cankered
beast
it
was
and
mony
an
trick
it
played
ill
to
please
it
was
and
easily
angered
ran
about
the
haill
castle
chattering
and
yowling
and
pinching
and
biting
folk
especially
before
or
disturbances
in
the
state
sir
robert
caa
it
major
weir
after
the
warlock
that
was
burnt
and
few
folk
liked
either
the
name
or
the
conditions
of
the
creature
they
thought
there
was
something
in
it
by
ordinar
and
my
gudesire
was
not
just
easy
in
his
mind
when
the
door
shut
on
him
and
he
saw
himself
in
the
room
wi
naebody
but
the
laird
dougal
maccallum
and
the
major
a
thing
that
hadna
chanced
to
him
before
sir
robert
sat
or
i
should
say
lay
in
a
great
armchair
wi
his
grand
velvet
gown
and
his
feet
on
a
cradle
for
he
had
baith
gout
and
gravel
and
his
face
looked
as
gash
and
ghastly
as
satan
major
weir
sat
opposite
to
him
in
a
red
laced
coat
and
the
laird
wig
on
his
head
and
aye
as
sir
robert
girned
wi
pain
the
jackanape
girned
too
like
a
between
a
pair
of
tangs
an
fearsome
couple
they
were
the
laird
was
hung
on
a
pin
behind
him
and
his
broadsword
and
his
pistols
within
reach
for
he
keepit
up
the
auld
fashion
of
having
the
weapons
ready
and
a
horse
saddled
day
and
night
just
as
he
used
to
do
when
he
was
able
to
loup
on
horseback
and
away
after
ony
of
the
he
could
get
speerings
of
some
said
it
was
for
fear
of
the
whigs
taking
vengeance
but
i
judge
it
was
just
his
auld
custom
he
wasna
gien
to
fear
ony
thing
the
wi
its
black
cover
and
brass
clasps
was
lying
beside
him
and
a
book
of
sculduddry
sangs
was
put
betwixt
the
leaves
to
keep
it
open
at
the
place
where
it
bore
evidence
against
the
goodman
of
as
behind
the
hand
with
his
mails
and
duties
sir
robert
gave
my
gudesire
a
look
as
if
he
would
have
withered
his
heart
in
his
bosom
ye
maun
ken
he
had
a
way
of
bending
his
brows
that
men
saw
the
visible
mark
of
a
in
his
forehead
as
if
it
had
been
stamped
there
are
ye
come
ye
son
of
a
toom
whistle
said
sir
robert
zounds
if
you
are
my
gudesire
with
as
gude
a
countenance
as
he
could
put
on
made
a
leg
and
placed
the
bag
of
money
on
the
table
wi
a
dash
like
a
man
that
does
something
clever
the
laird
drew
it
to
him
hastily
is
it
all
here
steenie
man
your
honour
will
find
it
right
said
my
gudesire
here
dougal
said
the
laird
gie
steenie
a
tass
of
brandy
down
stairs
till
i
count
the
siller
and
write
the
receipt
but
they
werena
weel
out
of
the
room
when
sir
robert
gied
a
yelloch
that
garr
the
castle
rock
back
ran
dougal
in
flew
the
livery
men
yell
on
yell
gied
the
laird
ilk
ane
mair
awfu
than
the
ither
my
gudesire
knew
not
whether
to
stand
or
flee
but
he
ventured
back
into
the
parlour
where
a
was
gaun
naebody
to
say
come
in
or
gae
out
terribly
the
laird
roared
for
cauld
water
to
his
feet
and
wine
to
cool
his
throat
and
hell
hell
hell
and
its
flames
was
aye
the
word
in
his
mouth
they
brought
him
water
and
when
they
plunged
his
swoln
feet
into
the
tub
he
cried
out
it
was
burning
and
folk
say
that
it
bubble
and
sparkle
like
a
seething
caldron
he
flung
the
cup
at
dougal
head
and
said
he
had
given
him
blood
instead
of
burgundy
and
sure
aneugh
the
lass
washed
clotted
blood
aff
the
carpet
the
neist
day
the
jackanape
they
caa
major
weir
it
jibbered
and
cried
as
if
it
was
mocking
its
master
my
gudesire
head
was
like
to
turn
he
forgot
baith
siller
and
receipt
and
down
stairs
he
banged
but
as
he
ran
the
shrieks
came
faint
and
fainter
there
was
a
shivering
groan
and
word
gaed
through
the
castle
that
the
laird
was
dead
weel
away
came
my
gudesire
wi
his
finger
in
his
mouth
and
his
best
hope
was
that
dougal
had
seen
the
and
heard
the
laird
speak
of
writing
the
receipt
the
young
laird
now
sir
john
came
from
edinburgh
to
see
things
put
to
rights
sir
john
and
his
father
never
gree
weel
sir
john
had
been
bred
an
advocate
and
afterwards
sat
in
the
last
scots
parliament
and
voted
for
the
union
having
gotten
it
was
thought
a
rug
of
the
compensations
if
his
father
could
have
come
out
of
his
grave
he
would
have
brained
him
for
it
on
his
awn
hearthstane
some
thought
it
was
easier
counting
with
the
auld
rough
knight
than
the
young
ane
but
mair
of
that
anon
dougal
maccallum
poor
body
neither
grat
nor
graned
but
gaed
about
the
house
looking
like
a
corpse
but
directing
as
was
his
duty
a
the
order
of
the
grand
funeral
now
dougal
looked
aye
waur
and
waur
when
night
was
coming
and
was
aye
the
last
to
gang
to
his
bed
whilk
was
in
a
little
round
just
opposite
the
chamber
of
dais
whilk
his
master
occupied
while
he
was
living
and
where
he
now
lay
in
state
as
they
caa
it
the
night
before
the
funeral
dougal
could
keep
his
awn
counsel
nae
langer
he
cam
doun
with
his
proud
spirit
and
fairly
asked
auld
hutcheon
to
sit
in
his
room
with
him
for
an
hour
when
they
were
in
the
round
dougal
took
ae
tass
of
brandy
to
himsell
and
gave
another
to
hutcheon
and
wished
him
all
health
and
lang
life
and
said
that
for
himsell
he
wasna
lang
for
this
world
for
that
every
night
since
sir
robert
death
his
silver
call
had
sounded
from
the
just
as
it
used
to
do
at
nights
in
his
lifetime
to
call
dougal
to
help
to
turn
him
in
his
bed
dougal
said
that
being
alone
with
the
dead
on
that
floor
of
the
tower
for
naebody
cared
to
wake
sir
robert
redgauntlet
like
another
corpse
he
had
never
daured
to
answer
the
call
but
that
now
his
conscience
checked
him
for
neglecting
his
duty
for
though
death
breaks
service
said
maccallum
it
shall
never
break
my
service
to
sir
robert
and
i
will
answer
his
next
whistle
so
be
you
will
stand
by
me
hutcheon
hutcheon
had
nae
will
to
the
wark
but
he
had
stood
by
dougal
in
battle
and
broil
and
he
wad
not
fail
him
at
this
pinch
so
down
the
carles
sat
ower
a
stoup
of
brandy
and
hutcheon
who
was
something
of
a
clerk
would
have
read
a
chapter
of
the
bible
but
dougal
would
hear
naething
but
a
blaud
of
davie
lindsay
whilk
was
the
waur
preparation
when
midnight
came
and
the
house
was
quiet
as
the
grave
sure
aneugh
the
silver
whistle
sounded
as
sharp
and
shrill
as
if
sir
robert
was
blowing
it
and
up
gat
the
twa
auld
and
tottered
into
the
room
where
the
dead
man
lay
hutcheon
saw
aneugh
at
the
first
glance
for
there
were
torches
in
the
room
which
showed
him
the
foul
fiend
in
his
ain
shape
sitting
on
the
laird
coffin
over
he
cowped
as
if
he
had
been
dead
he
could
not
tell
how
lang
he
lay
in
a
trance
at
the
door
but
when
he
gathered
himself
he
cried
on
his
neighbour
and
getting
nae
answer
raised
the
house
when
dougal
was
found
lying
dead
within
twa
steps
of
the
bed
where
his
master
coffin
was
placed
as
for
the
whistle
it
was
gaen
anes
and
aye
but
mony
a
time
was
it
heard
at
the
top
of
the
house
on
the
bartizan
and
amang
the
auld
chimneys
and
turrets
where
the
howlets
have
their
nests
sir
john
hushed
the
matter
up
and
the
funeral
passed
over
without
mair
but
when
a
was
ower
and
the
laird
was
beginning
to
settle
his
affairs
every
tenant
was
called
up
for
his
arrears
and
my
gudesire
for
the
full
sum
that
stood
against
him
in
the
weel
away
he
trots
to
the
castle
to
tell
his
story
and
there
he
is
introduced
to
sir
john
sitting
in
his
father
chair
in
deep
mourning
with
weepers
and
hanging
cravat
and
a
small
walking
rapier
by
his
side
instead
of
the
auld
broadsword
that
had
a
of
steel
about
it
what
with
blade
chape
and
i
have
heard
their
communing
so
often
tauld
ower
that
i
almost
think
i
was
there
mysell
though
i
couldna
be
born
at
the
time
in
fact
alan
my
companion
mimicked
with
a
good
deal
of
humour
the
flattering
conciliating
tone
of
the
address
and
the
hypocritical
melancholy
of
the
laird
reply
his
grandfather
he
said
had
while
he
spoke
his
eye
fixed
on
the
as
if
it
were
a
that
he
was
afraid
would
spring
up
and
bite
him
i

the
laird
sighing
deeply
and

a
sudden
call

will
be
missed
in
the
country

till

and
write

receipt
he

wi
the
pains
that

said
sir
john
after
a
pause
but
you
maybe

in
the
presence
of
somebody
i
want
but
a
evidence
stephen
i
would
go
ower
strictly
to
work
with
no
poor
man
troth
sir
john
there

naebody
in
the
room
but
dougal
maccallum
the
butler
but
as
your
honour
kens
he
has
followed
his
auld
master
very
unlucky
again
stephen
said
sir
john
without
altering
his
voice
a
single
note
the
man
to
whom
ye
paid
the
money
is
dead
and
the
man
who
witnessed
the
payment
is
dead
too
and
the
siller
which
should
have
been
to
the
fore
is
neither
seen
nor
heard
tell
of
in
the
repositories
how
am
i
to
believe
a
this
i
dinna
ken
your
honour
but
there
is
a
bit
memorandum
note
of
the
very
coins
for
god
help
me
i
had
to
borrow
out
of
twenty
purses
and
i
am
sure
that
ilka
man
there
set
down
will
take
his
grit
oath
for
what
purpose
i
borrowed
the
money
i
have
little
doubt
ye
the
money
steenie
it
is
the
to
my
father
that
i
want
to
have
some
proof
of
the
siller
maun
be
about
the
house
sir
john
and
since
your
honour
never
got
it
and
his
honour
that
was
canna
have
it
him
maybe
some
of
the
family
may
have
seen
it
we
will
examine
the
servants
stephen
that
is
but
reasonable
but
lackey
and
lass
and
page
and
groom
all
denied
stoutly
that
they
had
ever
seen
such
a
bag
of
money
as
my
gudesire
described
what
was
waur
he
had
unluckily
not
mentioned
to
any
living
soul
of
them
his
purpose
of
paying
his
rent
ae
quean
had
noticed
something
under
his
arm
but
she
took
it
for
the
pipes
sir
john
redgauntlet
ordered
the
servants
out
of
the
room
and
then
said
to
my
gudesire
now
steenie
ye
see
you
have
fair
play
and
as
i
have
little
doubt
ye
ken
better
where
to
find
the
siller
than
ony
other
body
i
beg
in
fair
terms
and
for
your
own
sake
that
you
will
end
this
fasherie
for
stephen
ye
maun
pay
or
flit
the
lord
forgie
your
opinion
said
stephen
driven
almost
to
his
end
i
am
an
honest
man
so
am
i
stephen
said
his
honour
and
so
are
all
the
folks
in
the
house
i
hope
but
if
there
be
a
knave
amongst
us
it
must
be
he
that
tells
the
story
he
can
not
prove
he
paused
and
then
added
mair
sternly
if
i
understand
your
trick
sir
you
want
to
take
advantage
of
some
malicious
reports
concerning
things
in
this
family
and
particularly
respecting
my
father
sudden
death
thereby
to
cheat
me
out
of
the
money
and
perhaps
take
away
my
character
by
insinuating
that
i
have
received
the
rent
i
am
where
do
you
suppose
this
money
to
be
i
insist
upon
knowing
my
gudesire
saw
everything
look
sae
muckle
against
him
that
he
grew
nearly
desperate
however
he
shifted
from
one
foot
to
another
looked
to
every
corner
of
the
room
and
made
no
answer
speak
out
sirrah
said
the
laird
assuming
a
look
of
his
father
a
very
particular
ane
which
he
had
when
he
was
angry
it
seemed
as
if
the
wrinkles
of
his
frown
made
that
fearful
shape
of
a
shoe
in
the
middle
of
his
brow
speak
out
sir
i
know
your
thoughts
do
you
suppose
that
i
have
this
money
far
be
it
frae
me
to
say
so
said
stephen
do
you
charge
any
of
my
people
with
having
taken
it
i
wad
be
laith
to
charge
them
that
may
be
innocent
said
my
gudesire
and
if
there
be
anyone
that
is
guilty
i
have
nae
proof
somewhere
the
money
must
be
if
there
is
a
word
of
truth
in
your
story
said
sir
john
i
ask
where
you
think
it
is
and
demand
a
correct
answer
in
hell
if
you
have
my
thoughts
of
it
said
my
gudesire
driven
to
extremity
in
hell
with
your
father
his
jackanape
and
his
silver
whistle
down
the
stairs
he
ran
for
the
parlour
was
nae
place
for
him
after
such
a
word
and
he
heard
the
laird
swearing
blood
and
wounds
behind
him
as
fast
as
ever
did
sir
robert
and
roaring
for
the
bailie
and
the
away
rode
my
gudesire
to
his
chief
creditor
him
they
caa
laurie
lapraik
to
try
if
he
could
make
ony
thing
out
of
him
but
when
he
tauld
his
story
he
got
but
the
warst
word
in
his
wame
thief
beggar
and
dyvour
were
the
saftest
terms
and
to
the
boot
of
these
hard
terms
laurie
brought
up
the
auld
story
of
his
dipping
his
hand
in
the
blood
of
god
saunts
just
as
if
a
tenant
could
have
helped
riding
with
the
laird
and
that
a
laird
like
sir
robert
redgauntlet
my
gudesire
was
by
this
time
far
beyond
the
bounds
of
patience
and
while
he
and
laurie
were
at
deil
speed
the
liars
he
was
wanchancie
aneugh
to
abuse
lapraik
doctrine
as
weel
as
the
man
and
said
things
that
folk
flesh
grue
that
heard
them
he
wasna
just
himsell
and
he
had
lived
wi
a
wild
set
in
his
day
at
last
they
parted
and
my
gudesire
was
to
ride
hame
through
the
wood
of
pitmurkie
that
is
a
fou
of
black
firs
as
they
i
ken
the
wood
but
the
firs
may
be
black
or
white
for
what
i
can
at
the
entry
of
the
wood
there
is
a
wild
common
and
on
the
edge
of
the
common
a
little
lonely
that
was
keepit
then
by
an
they
suld
hae
caa
her
tibbie
faw
and
there
puir
steenie
cried
for
a
mutchkin
of
brandy
for
he
had
had
no
refreshment
the
haill
day
tibbie
was
earnest
wi
him
to
take
a
bite
of
meat
but
he
couldna
think
nor
would
he
take
his
foot
out
of
the
stirrup
and
took
off
the
brandy
wholely
at
twa
draughts
and
named
a
toast
at
each
the
first
was
the
memory
of
sir
robert
redgauntlet
and
might
he
never
lie
quiet
in
his
grave
till
he
had
righted
his
poor
and
the
second
was
a
health
to
man
enemy
if
he
would
but
get
him
back
the
pock
of
siller
or
tell
him
what
came
for
he
saw
the
haill
world
was
like
to
regard
him
as
a
thief
and
a
cheat
and
he
took
that
waur
than
even
the
ruin
of
his
house
and
hauld
on
he
rode
little
caring
where
it
was
a
dark
night
turned
and
the
trees
made
it
yet
darker
and
he
let
the
beast
take
its
ain
road
through
the
wood
when
all
of
a
sudden
from
tired
and
wearied
that
it
was
before
the
nag
began
to
spring
and
flee
and
stend
that
my
gudesire
could
hardly
keep
the
upon
the
whilk
a
horseman
suddenly
riding
up
beside
him
said
that
a
mettle
beast
of
yours
freend
will
you
sell
him
so
saying
he
touched
the
horse
neck
with
his
and
it
fell
into
its
auld
of
a
stumbling
trot
but
his
spunk
soon
out
of
him
i
think
continued
the
stranger
and
that
is
like
mony
a
man
courage
that
thinks
he
wad
do
great
things
till
he
come
to
the
proof
my
gudesire
scarce
listened
to
this
but
spurred
his
horse
with
gude
to
you
freend
but
it
like
the
stranger
was
ane
that
doesna
lightly
yield
his
point
for
ride
as
steenie
liked
he
was
aye
beside
him
at
the
pace
at
last
my
gudesire
steenie
steenson
grew
half
angry
and
to
say
the
truth
half
feared
what
is
it
that
ye
want
with
me
freend
he
said
if
ye
be
a
robber
i
have
nae
money
if
ye
be
a
leal
man
wanting
company
i
have
nae
heart
to
mirth
or
speaking
and
if
ye
want
to
ken
the
road
i
scarce
ken
it
mysell
if
you
will
tell
me
your
grief
said
the
stranger
i
am
one
that
though
i
have
been
sair
miscaa
in
the
world
am
the
only
hand
for
helping
my
freends
so
my
gudesire
to
ease
his
ain
heart
mair
than
from
any
hope
of
help
told
him
the
story
from
beginning
to
end
it
a
hard
pinch
said
the
stranger
but
i
think
i
can
help
you
if
you
could
lend
the
money
sir
and
take
a
lang
day
i
ken
nae
other
help
on
earth
said
my
gudesire
but
there
may
be
some
under
the
earth
said
the
stranger
come
be
frank
wi
you
i
could
lend
you
the
money
on
bond
but
you
would
maybe
scruple
my
terms
now
i
can
tell
you
that
your
auld
laird
is
disturbed
in
his
grave
by
your
curses
and
the
wailing
of
your
family
and
if
ye
daur
venture
to
go
to
see
him
he
will
give
you
the
receipt
my
gudesire
hair
stood
on
end
at
this
proposal
but
he
thought
his
companion
might
be
some
humorsome
chield
that
was
trying
to
frighten
him
and
might
end
with
lending
him
the
money
besides
he
was
bauld
brandy
and
desperate
wi
distress
and
he
said
he
had
courage
to
go
to
the
gate
of
hell
and
a
step
farther
for
that
the
stranger
laughed
weel
they
rode
on
through
the
thickest
of
the
wood
when
all
of
a
sudden
the
horse
stopped
at
the
door
of
a
great
house
and
but
that
he
knew
the
place
was
ten
miles
off
my
father
would
have
thought
he
was
at
redgauntlet
castle
they
rode
into
the
outer
courtyard
through
the
muckle
faulding
yetts
and
aneath
the
auld
portcullis
and
the
whole
front
of
the
house
was
lighted
and
there
were
pipes
and
fiddles
and
as
much
dancing
and
deray
within
as
used
to
be
in
sir
robert
house
at
pace
and
yule
and
such
high
seasons
they
lap
off
and
my
gudesire
as
seemed
to
him
fastened
his
horse
to
the
very
ring
he
had
tied
him
to
that
morning
when
he
gaed
to
wait
on
the
young
sir
john
god
said
my
gudesire
if
sir
robert
death
be
but
a
dream
he
knocked
at
the
ha
door
just
as
he
was
wont
and
his
auld
acquaintance
dougal
maccallum
just
after
his
wont
too
came
to
open
the
door
and
said
piper
steenie
are
ye
there
lad
sir
robert
has
been
crying
for
you
my
gudesire
was
like
a
man
in
a
dream
he
looked
for
the
stranger
but
he
was
gane
for
the
time
at
last
he
just
tried
to
say
ha
dougal
driveower
are
ye
living
i
thought
ye
had
been
dead
never
fash
yoursell
wi
me
said
dougal
but
look
to
yoursell
and
see
ye
tak
naething
frae
onybody
here
neither
meat
drink
or
siller
except
just
the
receipt
that
is
your
ain
so
saying
he
led
the
way
out
through
halls
and
trances
that
were
weel
kend
to
my
gudesire
and
into
the
auld
oak
parlour
and
there
was
as
much
singing
of
profane
sangs
and
birling
of
red
wine
and
speaking
blasphemy
and
sculduddry
as
had
ever
been
in
redgauntlet
castle
when
it
was
at
the
blithest
but
lord
take
us
in
keeping
what
a
set
of
ghastly
revellers
they
were
that
sat
round
that
table
my
gudesire
kend
mony
that
had
long
before
gane
to
their
place
for
often
had
he
piped
to
the
most
part
in
the
hall
of
redgauntlet
there
was
the
fierce
middleton
and
the
dissolute
rothes
and
the
crafty
lauderdale
and
dalyell
with
his
bald
head
and
a
beard
to
his
girdle
and
earlshall
with
cameron
blude
on
his
hand
and
wild
bonshaw
that
tied
blessed
mr
cargill
limbs
till
the
blude
sprang
and
dunbarton
douglas
the
traitor
baith
to
country
and
king
there
was
the
bluidy
advocate
mackenyie
who
for
his
worldly
wit
and
wisdom
had
been
to
the
rest
as
a
god
and
there
was
claverhouse
as
beautiful
as
when
he
lived
with
his
long
dark
curled
locks
streaming
down
over
his
laced
and
his
left
hand
always
on
his
right
to
hide
the
wound
that
the
silver
bullet
had
made
he
sat
apart
from
them
all
and
looked
at
them
with
a
melancholy
haughty
countenance
while
the
rest
hallooed
and
sung
and
laughed
that
the
room
rang
but
their
smiles
were
fearfully
contorted
from
time
to
time
and
their
laughter
passed
into
such
wild
sounds
as
made
my
gudesire
very
nails
grow
blue
and
chilled
the
marrow
in
his
banes
they
that
waited
at
the
table
were
just
the
wicked
and
troopers
that
had
done
their
work
and
cruel
bidding
on
earth
there
was
the
lang
lad
of
the
nethertown
that
helped
to
take
argyle
and
the
bishop
summoner
that
they
called
the
deil
and
the
wicked
guardsmen
in
their
laced
coats
and
the
savage
highland
amorites
that
shed
blood
like
water
and
many
a
proud
haughty
of
heart
and
bloody
of
hand
cringing
to
the
rich
and
making
them
wickeder
than
they
would
be
grinding
the
poor
to
powder
when
the
rich
had
broken
them
to
fragments
and
mony
mony
mair
were
coming
and
ganging
a
as
busy
in
their
vocation
as
if
they
had
been
alive
sir
robert
redgauntlet
in
the
midst
of
a
this
fearful
riot
cried
a
voice
like
thunder
on
steenie
piper
to
come
to
the
where
he
was
sitting
his
legs
stretched
out
before
him
and
swathed
up
with
flannel
with
his
holster
pistols
aside
him
while
the
great
broadsword
rested
against
his
chair
just
as
my
gudesire
had
seen
him
the
last
time
upon
earth
the
very
cushion
for
the
jackanape
was
close
to
him
but
the
creature
itsell
was
not
there
it
wasna
its
hour
it
likely
for
he
heard
them
say
as
he
came
forward
is
not
the
major
come
yet
and
another
answered
the
jackanape
will
be
here
betimes
the
morn
and
when
my
gudesire
came
forward
sir
robert
or
his
ghaist
or
the
deevil
in
his
likeness
said
weel
piper
hae
ye
settled
wi
my
son
for
the
year
rent
with
much
ado
my
father
gat
breath
to
say
that
sir
john
would
not
settle
without
his
honour
receipt
ye
shall
hae
that
for
a
tune
of
the
pipes
steenie
said
the
appearance
of
sir
robert
play
us
up
hoddled
luckie
now
this
was
a
tune
my
gudesire
learned
frae
a
warlock
that
heard
it
when
they
were
worshipping
satan
at
their
meetings
and
my
gudesire
had
sometimes
played
it
at
the
ranting
suppers
in
redgauntlet
castle
but
never
very
willingly
and
now
he
grew
cauld
at
the
very
name
of
it
and
said
for
excuse
he
hadna
his
pipes
wi
him
maccallum
ye
limb
of
beelzebub
said
the
fearfu
sir
robert
bring
steenie
the
pipes
that
i
am
keeping
for
him
maccallum
brought
a
pair
of
pipes
might
have
served
the
piper
of
donald
of
the
isles
but
he
gave
my
gudesire
a
nudge
as
he
offered
them
and
looking
secretly
and
closely
steenie
saw
that
the
chanter
was
of
steel
and
heated
to
a
white
heat
so
he
had
fair
warning
not
to
trust
his
fingers
with
it
so
he
excused
himself
again
and
said
he
was
faint
and
frightened
and
had
not
wind
aneugh
to
fill
the
bag
then
ye
maun
eat
and
drink
steenie
said
the
figure
for
we
do
little
else
here
and
it
ill
speaking
between
a
fou
man
and
a
fasting
now
these
were
the
very
words
that
the
bloody
earl
of
douglas
said
to
keep
the
king
messenger
in
hand
while
he
cut
the
head
off
maclellan
of
bombie
at
the
threave
castle
and
that
put
steenie
mair
and
mair
on
his
guard
so
he
spoke
up
like
a
man
and
said
he
came
neither
to
eat
or
drink
or
make
minstrelsy
but
simply
for
his
ain
to
ken
what
was
come
o
the
money
he
had
paid
and
to
get
a
discharge
for
it
and
he
was
so
by
this
time
that
he
charged
sir
robert
for
he
had
no
power
to
say
the
holy
name
and
as
he
hoped
for
peace
and
rest
to
spread
no
snares
for
him
but
just
to
give
him
his
ain
the
appearance
gnashed
its
teeth
and
laughed
but
it
took
from
a
large
the
receipt
and
handed
it
to
steenie
there
is
your
receipt
ye
pitiful
cur
and
for
the
money
my
of
a
son
may
go
look
for
it
in
the
cat
cradle
my
gudesire
uttered
mony
thanks
and
was
about
to
retire
when
sir
robert
roared
aloud
stop
though
thou
son
of
a
whore
i
am
not
done
with
thee
here
we
do
nothing
for
nothing
and
you
must
return
on
this
very
day
twelvemonth
to
pay
your
master
the
homage
that
you
owe
me
for
my
protection
my
father
tongue
was
loosed
of
a
suddenty
and
he
said
aloud
i
refer
mysell
to
god
pleasure
and
not
to
yours
he
had
no
sooner
uttered
the
word
than
all
was
dark
around
him
and
he
sunk
on
the
earth
with
such
a
sudden
shock
that
he
lost
both
breath
and
sense
how
lang
steenie
lay
there
he
could
not
tell
but
when
he
came
to
himsell
he
was
lying
in
the
auld
kirkyard
of
redgauntlet
parochine
just
at
the
door
of
the
family
aisle
and
the
scutcheon
of
the
auld
knight
sir
robert
hanging
over
his
head
there
was
a
deep
morning
fog
on
grass
and
gravestane
around
him
and
his
horse
was
feeding
quietly
beside
the
minister
twa
cows
steenie
would
have
thought
the
whole
was
a
dream
but
he
had
the
receipt
in
his
hand
fairly
written
and
signed
by
the
auld
laird
only
the
last
letters
of
his
name
were
a
little
disorderly
written
like
one
seized
with
sudden
pain
sorely
troubled
in
his
mind
he
left
that
dreary
place
rode
through
the
mist
to
redgauntlet
castle
and
with
much
ado
he
got
speech
of
the
laird
well
you
dyvour
bankrupt
was
the
first
word
have
you
brought
me
my
rent
no
answered
my
gudesire
i
have
not
but
i
have
brought
your
honour
sir
robert
receipt
for
it
how
sirrah
sir
robert
receipt
you
told
me
he
had
not
given
you
one
will
your
honour
please
to
see
if
that
bit
line
is
right
sir
john
looked
at
every
line
and
at
every
letter
with
much
attention
and
at
last
at
the
date
which
my
gudesire
had
not
observed
my
appointed
he
read
of
what
that
is
yesterday
villain
thou
must
have
gone
to
hell
for
this
i
got
it
from
your
honour
father
whether
he
be
in
heaven
or
hell
i
know
not
said
steenie
i
will
delate
you
for
a
warlock
to
the
privy
council
said
sir
john
i
will
send
you
to
your
master
the
devil
with
the
help
of
a
and
a
torch
i
intend
to
delate
mysell
to
the
presbytery
said
steenie
and
tell
them
all
i
have
seen
last
night
whilk
are
things
fitter
for
them
to
judge
of
than
a
borrel
man
like
me
sir
john
paused
composed
himsell
and
desired
to
hear
the
full
history
and
my
gudesire
told
it
him
from
point
to
point
as
i
have
told
it
you
word
for
word
neither
more
nor
less
sir
john
was
silent
again
for
a
long
time
and
at
last
he
said
very
composedly
steenie
this
story
of
yours
concerns
the
honour
of
many
a
noble
family
besides
mine
and
if
it
be
a
to
keep
yourself
out
of
my
danger
the
least
you
can
expect
is
to
have
a
iron
driven
through
your
tongue
and
that
will
be
as
bad
as
scaulding
your
fingers
with
a
redhot
chanter
but
yet
it
may
be
true
steenie
and
if
the
money
cast
up
i
shall
not
know
what
to
think
of
but
where
shall
we
find
the
cat
cradle
there
are
cats
enough
about
the
old
house
but
i
think
they
kitten
without
the
ceremony
of
bed
or
cradle
we
were
best
ask
hutcheon
said
my
gudesire
he
kens
a
the
odd
corners
about
as
weel
as
another
that
is
now
gane
and
that
i

hutcheon
when
he
was
asked
told
them
that
a
ruinous
turret
lang
disused
next
to
the
only
accessible
by
a
ladder
for
the
opening
was
on
the
outside
and
far
above
the
battlements
was
called
of
old
the
cat
cradle
there
will
i
go
immediately
said
sir
john
and
he
took
with
what
purpose
heaven
kens
one
of
his
father
pistols
from
the
where
they
had
lain
since
the
night
he
died
and
hastened
to
the
battlements
it
was
a
dangerous
place
to
climb
for
the
ladder
was
auld
and
frail
and
wanted
ane
or
twa
rounds
however
up
got
sir
john
and
entered
at
the
turret
door
where
his
body
stopped
the
only
little
light
that
was
in
the
bit
turret
something
flees
at
him
wi
a
vengeance
maist
dang
him
back
ower
bang
gaed
the
knight
pistol
and
hutcheon
that
held
the
ladder
and
my
gudesire
that
stood
beside
him
hears
a
loud
skelloch
a
minute
after
sir
john
flings
the
body
of
the
jackanape
down
to
them
and
cries
that
the
siller
is
fund
and
that
they
should
come
up
and
help
him
and
there
was
the
bag
of
siller
sure
aneugh
and
mony
orra
things
besides
that
had
been
missing
for
mony
a
day
and
sir
john
when
he
had
riped
the
turret
weel
led
my
gudesire
into
the
and
took
him
by
the
hand
and
spoke
kindly
to
him
and
said
he
was
sorry
he
should
have
doubted
his
word
and
that
he
would
hereafter
be
a
good
master
to
him
to
make
amends
and
now
steenie
said
sir
john
although
this
vision
of
yours
tends
on
the
whole
to
my
father
credit
as
an
honest
man
that
he
should
even
after
his
death
desire
to
see
justice
done
to
a
poor
man
like
you
yet
you
are
sensible
that
men
might
make
bad
constructions
upon
it
concerning
his
soul
health
so
i
think
we
had
better
lay
the
haill
dirdum
on
that
creature
major
weir
and
say
naething
about
your
dream
in
the
wood
of
pitmurkie
you
had
taken
ower
muckle
brandy
to
be
very
certain
about
onything
and
steenie
this
receipt
his
hand
shook
while
he
held
it
out
it
but
a
queer
kind
of
document
and
we
will
do
best
i
think
to
put
it
quietly
in
the
fire
od
but
for
as
queer
as
it
is
it
a
the
voucher
i
have
for
my
rent
said
my
gudesire
who
was
afraid
it
may
be
of
losing
the
benefit
of
sir
robert
discharge
i
will
bear
the
contents
to
your
credit
in
the
and
give
you
a
discharge
under
my
own
hand
said
sir
john
and
that
on
the
spot
and
steenie
if
you
can
hold
your
tongue
about
this
matter
you
shall
sit
from
this
term
downward
at
an
easier
rent
mony
thanks
to
your
honour
said
steenie
who
saw
easily
in
what
corner
the
wind
was
doubtless
i
will
be
conformable
to
all
your
honour
commands
only
i
would
willingly
speak
wi
some
powerful
minister
on
the
subject
for
i
do
not
like
the
sort
of
soumons
of
appointment
whilk
your
honour
father
do
not
call
the
phantom
my
father
said
sir
john
interrupting
him
weel
then
the
thing
that
was
so
like
him
said
my
gudesire
he
spoke
of
my
coming
back
to
him
this
time
twelvemonth
and
it
a
weight
on
my
conscience
aweel
then
said
sir
john
if
you
be
so
much
distressed
in
mind
you
may
speak
to
our
minister
of
the
parish
he
is
a
douce
man
regards
the
honour
of
our
family
and
the
mair
that
he
may
look
for
some
patronage
from
me
wi
that
my
gudesire
readily
agreed
that
the
receipt
should
be
burnt
and
the
laird
threw
it
into
the
chimney
with
his
ain
hand
burn
it
would
not
for
them
though
but
away
it
flew
up
the
lum
wi
a
lang
train
of
sparks
at
its
tail
and
a
hissing
noise
like
a
squib
my
gudesire
gaed
down
to
the
manse
and
the
minister
when
he
had
heard
the
story
said
it
was
his
real
opinion
that
though
my
gudesire
had
gaen
very
far
in
tampering
with
dangerous
matters
yet
as
he
had
refused
the
devil
arles
for
such
was
the
offer
of
meat
and
drink
and
had
refused
to
do
homage
by
piping
at
his
bidding
he
hoped
that
if
he
held
a
circumspect
walk
hereafter
satan
could
take
little
advantage
by
what
was
come
and
gane
and
indeed
my
gudesire
of
his
ain
accord
long
forswore
baith
the
pipes
and
the
brandy
it
was
not
even
till
the
year
was
out
and
the
fatal
day
passed
that
he
would
so
much
as
take
the
fiddle
or
drink
usquebaugh
or
tippenny
sir
john
made
up
his
story
about
the
jackanape
as
he
liked
himsell
and
some
believe
till
this
day
there
was
no
more
in
the
matter
than
the
filching
nature
of
the
brute
indeed
ye
no
hinder
some
to
threap
that
it
was
nane
o
the
auld
enemy
that
dougal
and
my
gudesire
saw
in
the
laird
room

only
that
wanchancy
creature
the
major
capering
on
the
coffin
and
that
as
to
the
blawing
on
the
laird
whistle
that
was
heard
after
he
was
dead
the
filthy
brute
could
do
that
as
weel
as
the
laird
himsell
if
no
better
but
heaven
kens
the
truth
whilk
first
came
out
by

wife
after
sir
john

were
baith

wha
was
failed
in
his

not

at

nothing

the
castle
of
glamis
a
venerable
and
majestic
pile
of
buildings
says
an
old
scots
gazetteer
is
situate
about
one
mile
north
from
the
village
on
the
flat
grounds
at
the
confluence
of
the
glamis
burn
and
the
dean
there
is
a
print
of
it
given
by
slezer
in
charles
ii
reign
by
which
it
appears
to
have
been
anciently
much
more
extensive
being
a
large
quadrangular
mass
of
buildings
having
two
courts
in
front
with
a
tower
in
each
and
gateway
through
below
them
and
on
the
northern
side
was
the
principal
tower
which
now
constitutes
the
central
portion
of
the
present
castle
upwards
of
feet
in
height
the
building
received
the
addition
of
a
tower
in
one
of
its
angles
for
a
spiral
staircase
from
bottom
to
top
with
conical
roofs
the
wings
were
added

repaired

are

it
has
been
frequently
the
object
of
search
with
the

but
the
search
has
been
in

there
are
no
records
of
the
castle
prior
to
the
tenth
century
when
it
is
first
noticed
in
connection
with
the
death
of
malcolm
ii
in
tradition
says
that
he
was
murdered
in
this
castle
and
in
a
room
which
is
still
pointed
out
in
the
centre
of
the
principal
tower

that
the
murderers
lost
their
way
in

darkness
of

night

by
the
breaking
of
the

were
drowned

let
us
turn
now
to
the
ghosts
of
glamis
castle
a
lady
well
known
in
london
society
an
artistic
and
social
celebrity
wealthy
beyond
all
doubts
of
the
future
a
cultivated
and
indeed
slightly
woman
went
to
stay
at
glamis
castle
for
the
first
time
she
was
allotted
very
handsome
apartments
just
on
the
point
of
junction
between
the
new
buildings
perhaps
a
hundred
or
two
hundred
years
old
and
the
very
ancient
part
of
the
castle
the
rooms
were
handsomely
furnished
no
gaunt
carvings
grinned
from
the
walls
no
grim
tapestry
swung
to
and
fro
making
strange
figures
look
still
stranger
by
the
flickering
all
was
smooth
cosy
and
modern
and
the
guest
retired
to
bed
without
a
thought
of
the
mysteries
of
glamis
in
the
morning
she
appeared
at
the
breakfast
table
quite
cheerful
and
to
the
inquiry
how
she
had
slept
she
replied
well
thanks
very
well
up
to
four
in
the
morning
but
your
scottish
carpenters
seem
to
come
to
work
very
early
i
suppose
they
put
up
their
scaffolding
quickly
though
for
they
are
quiet
now
this
speech
produced
a
dead
silence
and
the
speaker
saw
with
astonishment
that
the
faces
of
members
of
the
family
were
very
pale
she
was
asked
as
she
valued
the
friendship
of
all
there
never
to
speak
to
them
on
that
subject
again
there
had
been
no
carpenters
at
glamis
castle
for
months
past
this
fact
whatever
it
may
be
worth
is
absolutely
established
so
far
as
the
testimony
of
a
single
witness
can
establish
anything
the
lady
was
awakened
by
a
loud
knocking
and
hammering
as
if
somebody
were
putting
up
a
scaffold
and
the
noise
did
not
alarm
her
in
the
least
on
the
contrary
she
took
it
for
an
accident
due
to
the
presumed
matutinal
habits
of
the
people
she
knew
of
course
that
there
were
stories
about
glamis
but
had
not
the
remotest
idea
that
the
hammering
she
had
heard
was
connected
with
any
story
she
had
regarded
it
simply
as
an
annoyance
and
was
glad
to
get
to
sleep
after
an
unrestful
time
but
had
no
notion
of
the
noise
being
supernatural
until
informed
of
it
at
the
with
what
particular
event
in
the
stormy
annals
of
the
lyon
family
the
hammering
is
connected
is
quite
unknown
except
to
members
of
the
family
but
there
is
no
lack
of
legends
possible
and
impossible
to
account
for
any
sights
or
sounds
in
the
magnificent
old
feudal
edifice
it
is
said
that
once
a
visitor
stayed
at
glamis
castle
for
a
few
days
and
sitting
up
late
one
moonlight
night
saw
a
face
appear
at
the
window
opposite
to
him
the
owner
of
the
face
it
was
very
pale
with
great
sorrowful
eyes
appeared
to
wish
to
attract
attention
but
vanished
suddenly
from
the
window
as
if
plucked
suddenly
away
by
superior
strength
for
a
long
while
the
guest
gazed
at
the
window
in
the
hope
that
the
pale
face
and
great
sad
eyes
would
appear
again
nothing
was
seen
at
the
window
but
presently
horrible
shrieks
penetrated
even
the
thick
walls
of
the
castle
and
rent
the
night
air
an
hour
later
a
dark
huddled
figure
like
that
of
an
old
decrepit
woman
carrying
something
in
a
bundle
came
into
the
waning
moonlight
and
presently
vanished
there
is
a
modern
story
of
a
stonemason
who
was
engaged
at
glamis
castle
last
century
and
who
having
discovered
more
than
he
should
have
done
was
supplied
with
a
handsome
competency
upon
the
conditions
that
he
emigrated
and
kept
inviolable
the
secret
he
had
learned
the
employment
of
a
stonemason
is
explained
by
the
conditions
under
which
the
mystery
is
revealed
to
successive
heirs
and
factors
the
abode
of
the
dread
secret
is
in
a
part
of
the
castle
also
haunted
by
the
apparition
of
a
bearded
man
who
flits
about
at
night
but
without
committing
any
other
objectionable
action
what
connection
if
any
the
bearded
spectre
may
have
with
the
mystery
is
not
even
guessed
he
hovers
at
night
over
the
couches
of
children
for
an
instant
and
then
vanishes
the
secret
itself
abides
in
a
room
a
secret
chamber
the
very
situation
of
which
beyond
a
general
idea
that
it
is
in
the
most
ancient
part
of
the
castle
is
unknown
where
walls
are
fifteen
feet
thick
it
is
not
impossible
to
have
a
chamber
so
concealed
that
none
but
the
initiated
can
guess
its
position
it
was
once
attempted
by
a
madcap
party
of
guests
to
discover
the
locality
of
the
secret
chamber
by
hanging
their
towels
out
of
the
window
and
thus
deciding
in
favour
of
any
window
from
which
no
spotless
banner
waved
but
this
escapade
which
is
said
to
have
been
by
the
owners
ended
in
nothing
but
a
vague
conclusion
that
the
old
square
tower
must
be
the
spot
sought
xix
powys
castle
local
records
it
had
been
for
some
time
reported
in
the
neighbourhood
that
a
poor
unmarried
woman
who
was
a
member
of
the
methodist
society
and
had
become
serious
under
their
ministry
had
seen
and
conversed
with
the
apparition
of
a
gentleman
who
had
made
a
strange
discovery
to
her
mr
hampson
being
desirous
to
ascertain
if
there
was
any
truth
in
the
story
sent
for
the
woman
and
desired
her
to
give
an
exact
relation
of
the
whole
affair
from
her
own
mouth
and
as
near
the
truth
as
she
possibly
could
she
said
she
was
a
poor
woman
who
got
her
living
by
spinning
hemp
and
line
that
it
was
customary
for
the
farmers
and
gentlemen
of
that
neighbourhood
to
grow
a
little
hemp
or
line
in
the
corner
of
their
fields
for
their
own
home
consumption
and
as
she
had
a
good
hand
at
spinning
the
materials
she
used
to
go
from
house
to
house
to
inquire
for
work
that
her
method
was
where
they
employed
her
during
her
stay
to
have
meat
and
lodging
if
she
had
occasion
to
sleep
with
them
for
her
work
and
what
they
pleased
to
give
her
besides
that
among
other
places
she
happened
to
call
in
one
day
at
the
welsh
earl
powis
country
seat
called
redcastle
to
inquire
for
work
as
she
usually
had
done
before
the
quality
were
at
this
time
in
london
and
had
left
the
steward
and
his
wife
with
other
servants
as
usual
to
take
care
of
their
country
residence
in
their
absence
the
wife
set
her
to
work
and
in
the
evening
told
her
that
she
must
stay
all
night
with
them
as
they
had
more
work
for
her
to
do
next
day
when
arrived
two
or
three
of
the
servants
in
company
with
each
a
lighted
candle
in
her
hand
conducted
her
to
her
lodging
they
led
her
to
a
grand
room
with
a
boarded
floor
and
two
sash
windows
the
room
was
grandly
furnished
and
had
a
genteel
bed
in
one
corner
of
it
they
had
made
her
a
good
fire
and
had
placed
her
a
chair
and
a
table
before
it
and
a
large
lighted
candle
upon
the
table
they
told
her
that
was
her
bedroom
and
she
might
go
to
sleep
when
she
pleased
they
then
wished
a
good
night
and
withdrew
all
together
pulling
the
door
quickly
after
them
so
as
to
hasp
the
springsneck
in
the
brass
lock
that
was
upon
it
when
they
were
gone
she
gazed
a
while
at
the
fine
furniture
under
no
small
astonishment
that
they
should
put
such
a
poor
person
as
her
in
so
grand
a
room
and
bed
with
all
the
apparatus
of
fire
chair
table
and
candle
she
was
also
surprised
at
the
circumstance
of
the
servants
coming
so
many
together
with
each
of
them
a
candle
however
after
gazing
about
her
some
little
time
she
sat
down
and
took
out
of
her
pocket
a
small
welsh
bible
which
she
always
carried
about
with
her
and
in
which
she
usually
read
a
chapter
chiefly
in
the
new
testament
before
she
said
her
prayers
and
went
to
bed
while
she
was
reading
she
heard
the
room
door
open
and
turning
her
head
saw
a
gentleman
enter
in
a
hat
and
waistcoat
and
the
rest
of
his
dress
corresponding
therewith
i
think
she
was
very
particular
in
describing
the
rest
of
his
dress
to
mr
hampson
and
he
to
me
at
the
time
but
i
have
now
forgot
the
other
particulars
he
walked
down
by
the
sash
window
to
the
corner
of
the
room
and
then
returned
when
he
came
at
the
first
window
in
his
return
the
bottom
of
which
was
nearly
he
rested
his
elbow
on
the
bottom
of
the
window
and
the
side
of
his
face
upon
the
palm
of
his
hand
and
stood
in
that
leaning
posture
for
some
time
with
his
side
partly
towards
her
she
looked
at
him
earnestly
to
see
if
she
knew
him
but
though
from
her
frequent
intercourse
with
them
she
had
a
personal
knowledge
of
all
the
present
family
he
appeared
a
stranger
to
her
she
supposed
afterwards
that
he
stood
in
this
manner
to
encourage
her
to
speak
but
as
she
did
not
after
some
little
time
he
walked
off
pulling
the
door
after
him
as
the
servants
had
done
before
she
began
now
to
be
much
alarmed
concluding
it
to
be
an
apparition
and
that
they
had
put
her
there
on
purpose
this
was
really
the
case
the
room
it
seems
had
been
disturbed
for
a
long
time
so
that
nobody
could
sleep
peaceably
in
it
and
as
she
passed
for
a
very
serious
woman
the
servants
took
it
in
their
heads
to
put
the
methodist
and
spirit
together
to
see
what
they
would
make
out
of
it
startled
at
this
thought
she
rose
from
her
chair
and
kneeled
down
by
the
bedside
to
say
her
prayers
while
she
was
praying
he
came
in
again
walked
round
the
room
and
came
close
behind
her
she
had
it
on
her
mind
to
speak
but
when
she
attempted
it
she
was
so
very
much
agitated
that
she
could
not
utter
a
word
he
walked
out
of
the
room
again
pulling
the
door
shut
as
before
she
begged
that
god
would
strengthen
her
and
not
suffer
her
to
be
tried
beyond
what
she
was
able
to
bear
she
recovered
her
surprise
and
thought
she
felt
more
confidence
and
resolution
and
determined
if
he
came
in
again
she
would
speak
to
him
if
possible
he
presently
came
in
again
walked
round
and
came
behind
her
as
before
she
turned
her
head
and
said
pray
sir
who
are
you
and
what
do
you
want
he
put
up
his
finger
and
said
take
up
the
candle
and
follow
me
and
i
will
tell
you
she
got
up
took
up
the
candle
and
followed
him
out
of
the
room
he
led
her
through
a
long
boarded
passage
till
they
came
to
the
door
of
another
room
which
he
opened
and
went
in
it
was
a
small
room
or
what
might
be
called
a
large
closet
as
the
room
was
small
and
i
believed
him
to
be
a
spirit
said
she
i
stopped
at
the
door
he
turned
and
said
in
i
will
not
hurt
you
so
i
walked
in
he
said
what
i
do
i
said
will
he
stooped
and
tore
up
one
of
the
boards
of
the
floor
and
there
appeared
under
it
a
box
with
an
iron
handle
in
the
lid
he
said
you
see
that
box
i
said
i
do
he
then
stepped
to
one
side
of
the
room
and
showed
me
a
crevice
in
the
wall
where
he
said
a
key
was
hid
that
would
open
it
he
said
box
and
key
must
be
taken
out
and
sent
to
the
earl
in
london
naming
the
earl
and
his
residence
in
the
city
he
said
you
see
it
done
i
said
will
do
my
best
to
get
it
done
and
he
said
and
i
will
trouble
the
house
no
longer
he
then
walked
out
of
the
room
and
left
me
he
seems
to
have
been
a
very
civil
spirit
and
to
have
been
very
careful
to
affright
her
as
little
as
possible
i
stepped
to
the
room
door
and
set
up
a
shout
the
steward
and
his
wife
with
the
other
servants
came
to
me
immediately
all
clinging
together
with
a
number
of
lights
in
their
hands
it
seems
they
had
all
been
waiting
to
see
the
issue
of
the
interview
betwixt
me
and
the
apparition
they
asked
me
what
was
the
matter
i
told
them
the
foregoing
circumstances
and
showed
them
the
box
the
steward
durst
not
meddle
with
it
but
his
wife
had
more
courage
and
with
the
help
of
the
other
servants
tugged
it
out
and
found
the
key
she
said
by
their
lifting
it
appeared
to
be
pretty
heavy
but
that
she
did
not
see
it
opened
and
therefore
did
not
know
what
it
contained
perhaps
money
or
writings
of
consequence
to
the
family
or
both
they
took
it
away
with
them
and
she
then
went
to
bed
and
slept
peaceably
till
morning
it
appeared
that
they
sent
the
box
to
the
earl
in
london
with
an
account
of
the
manner
of
its
discovery
and
by
whom
as
the
earl
sent
down
orders
immediately
to
his
steward
to
inform
the
poor
woman
who
had
been
the
occasion
of
its
discovery
that
if
she
would
come
and
reside
in
his
family
she
would
be
comfortably
provided
for
during
her
remaining
days
or
if
she
did
not
choose
to
reside
constantly
with
them
if
she
would
let
them
know
when
she
wanted
assistance
she
would
be
liberally
supplied
at
his
lordship
expense
as
long
as
she
lived
and
mr
hampson
said
it
was
a
known
fact
in
the
neighbourhood
that
she
had
been
supplied
from
his
lordship
family
from
the
time
the
affair
was
said
to
have
happened
and
continued
to
be
so
at
the
time
she
gave
mr
hampson
this
account
she
told
him
that
she
was
so
often
solicited
by
curious
people
to
relate
the
story
that
she
was
weary
of
repeating
it
but
to
oblige
him
she
once
more
related
the
particulars
wishing
now
to
have
done
with
it
mr
hampson
said
she
appeared
to
be
a
sensible
intelligent
person
and
that
he
saw
no
reason
to
doubt
her
veracity
i
know
many
persons
in
the
present
day
laugh
at
such
stories
and
affect
very
much
to
doubt
their
reality
while
others
totally
deny
the
possibility
of
their
existence
however
scripture
and
many
relations
seem
to
favour
the
idea
and
the
present
story
appeared
so
singular
and
so
well
attested
and
i
had
it
so
near
the
that
i
thought
it
might
perhaps
be
worth
preserving
and
i
have
therefore
taken
pains
to
record
it
admitting
it
to
be
true
it
should
seem
that
the
consequence
to
the
family
of
what
the
hidden
box
contained
was
the
formal
cause
of
the
spirit
disquiet
and
of
its
disturbing
the
house
so
much
and
so
long
in
order
to
bring
about
the
discovery
but
why
the
departed
spirit
should
concern
itself
in
the
affairs
of
this
world
after
it
has
left
it
or
why
they
should
disquiet
it
so
as
to
cause
it
to
reappear
and
make
disturbances
in
order
to
discover
and
have
things
righted
as
in
the
preceding
case
or
why
this
should
be
done
in
some
cases
of
apparently
less
moment
while
in
other
cases
much
greater
family
injuries
seem
to
be
suffered
and
no
spirit
appears
to
interest
itself
in
the
case
are
circumstances
for
which
we
can
by
no
means
account
a
cloud
sits
deep
on
futurity
and
we
are
so
little
acquainted
with
the
laws
of
the
spiritual
world
that
we
are
perhaps
incapable
in
our
present
state
of
comprehending
its
nature
or
of
giving
any
satisfactory
account
of
these
matters

croglin
grange
from
archdeacon
hare
autobiography
fisher
said
the
captain
may
sound
a
very
plebeian
name
but
this
family
is
of
very
ancient
lineage
and
for
many
hundreds
of
years
they
have
possessed
a
very
curious
old
place
in
cumberland
which
bears
the
weird
name
of
croglin
grange
the
great
characteristic
of
the
house
is
that
never
at
any
period
of
its
very
long
existence
has
it
been
more
than
one
story
high
but
it
has
a
terrace
from
which
large
grounds
sweep
away
towards
the
church
in
the
hollow
and
a
fine
distant
view
when
in
lapse
of
years
the
fishers
outgrew
croglin
grange
in
family
and
fortune
they
were
wise
enough
not
to
destroy
the
characteristic
of
the
place
by
adding
another
story
to
the
house
but
they
went
away
to
the
south
to
reside
at
thorncombe
near
guildford
and
they
let
croglin
grange
they
were
extremely
fortunate
in
their
tenants
two
brothers
and
a
sister
they
heard
their
praises
from
all
quarters
to
their
poorer
neighbours
they
were
all
that
is
most
kind
and
beneficent
and
their
neighbours
of
a
higher
class
spoke
of
them
as
a
welcome
addition
to
the
little
society
of
the
neighbourhood
on
their
part
the
tenants
were
greatly
delighted
with
their
new
residence
the
arrangement
of
the
house
which
would
have
been
a
trial
to
many
was
not
so
to
them
in
every
respect
croglin
grange
was
exactly
suited
to
them
the
winter
was
spent
most
happily
by
the
new
inmates
of
croglin
grange
who
shared
in
all
the
little
social
pleasures
of
the
district
and
made
themselves
very
popular
in
the
following
summer
there
was
one
day
which
was
dreadfully
annihilatingly
hot
the
brothers
lay
under
the
trees
with
their
books
for
it
was
too
hot
for
any
active
occupation
the
sister
sat
in
the
verandah
and
worked
or
tried
to
work
for
in
the
intense
sultriness
of
that
summer
day
work
was
next
to
impossible
they
dined
early
and
after
dinner
they
still
sat
out
in
the
verandah
enjoying
the
cool
air
which
came
with
evening
and
they
watched
the
sun
set
and
the
moon
rise
over
the
belt
of
trees
which
separated
the
grounds
from
the
churchyard
seeing
it
mount
the
heavens
till
the
whole
lawn
was
bathed
in
silver
light
across
which
the
long
shadows
from
the
shrubbery
fell
as
if
embossed
so
vivid
and
distinct
were
they
when
they
separated
for
the
night
all
retiring
to
their
rooms
on
the
for
as
i
said
there
was
no
upstairs
in
that
house
the
sister
felt
that
the
heat
was
still
so
great
that
she
could
not
sleep
and
having
fastened
her
window
she
did
not
close
the
shutters
in
that
very
quiet
place
it
was
not
necessary
and
propped
against
the
pillows
she
still
watched
the
wonderful
the
marvellous
beauty
of
that
summer
night
gradually
she
became
aware
of
two
lights
two
lights
which
flickered
in
and
out
in
the
belt
of
trees
which
separated
the
lawn
from
the
churchyard
and
as
her
gaze
became
fixed
upon
them
she
saw
them
emerge
fixed
in
a
dark
substance
a
definite
ghastly
which
seemed
every
moment
to
become
nearer
increasing
in
size
and
substance
as
it
approached
every
now
and
then
it
was
lost
for
a
moment
in
the
long
shadows
which
stretched
across
the
lawn
from
the
trees
and
then
it
emerged
larger
than
ever
and
still
coming
on
on
as
she
watched
it
the
most
uncontrollable
horror
seized
her
she
longed
to
get
away
but
the
door
was
close
to
the
window
and
the
door
was
locked
on
the
inside
and
while
she
was
unlocking
it
she
must
be
for
an
instant
nearer
to
she
longed
to
scream
but
her
voice
seemed
paralysed
her
tongue
glued
to
the
roof
of
her
mouth
suddenly
she
never
could
explain
why
afterwards
the
terrible
object
seemed
to
turn
to
one
side
seemed
to
be
going
round
the
house
not
to
be
coming
to
her
at
all
and
immediately
she
jumped
out
of
bed
and
rushed
to
the
door
but
as
she
was
unlocking
it
she
heard
scratch
scratch
scratch
upon
the
window
and
saw
a
hideous
brown
face
with
flaming
eyes
glaring
in
at
her
she
rushed
back
to
the
bed
but
the
creature
continued
to
scratch
scratch
scratch
upon
the
window
she
felt
a
sort
of
mental
comfort
in
the
knowledge
that
the
window
was
securely
fastened
on
the
inside
suddenly
the
scratching
sound
ceased
and
a
kind
of
pecking
sound
took
its
place
then
in
her
agony
she
became
aware
that
the
creature
was
unpicking
the
lead
the
noise
continued
and
a
diamond
pane
of
glass
fell
into
the
room
then
a
long
bony
finger
of
the
creature
came
in
and
turned
the
handle
of
the
window
and
the
window
opened
and
the
creature
came
in
and
it
came
across
the
room
and
her
terror
was
so
great
that
she
could
not
scream
and
it
came
up
to
the
bed
and
it
twisted
its
long
bony
fingers
into
her
hair
and
it
dragged
her
head
over
the
side
of
the
bed
and
it
bit
her
violently
in
the
throat
as
it
bit
her
her
voice
was
released
and
she
screamed
with
all
her
might
and
main
her
brothers
rushed
out
of
their
rooms
but
the
door
was
locked
on
the
inside
a
moment
was
lost
while
they
got
a
poker
and
broke
it
open
then
the
creature
had
already
escaped
through
the
window
and
the
sister
bleeding
violently
from
a
wound
in
the
throat
was
lying
unconscious
over
the
side
of
the
bed
one
brother
pursued
the
creature
which
fled
before
him
through
the
moonlight
with
gigantic
strides
and
eventually
seemed
to
disappear
over
the
wall
into
the
churchyard
then
he
rejoined
his
brother
by
the
sister
bedside
she
was
dreadfully
hurt
and
her
wound
was
a
very
definite
one
but
she
was
of
strong
disposition
not
either
given
to
romance
or
superstition
and
when
she
came
to
herself
she
said
has
happened
is
most
extraordinary
and
i
am
very
much
hurt
it
seems
inexplicable
but
of
course
there
is
an
explanation
and
we
must
wait
for
it
it
will
turn
out
that
a
lunatic
has
escaped
from
some
asylum
and
found
his
way
here
the
wound
healed
and
she
appeared
to
get
well
but
the
doctor
who
was
sent
for
would
not
believe
that
she
could
bear
so
terrible
a
shock
so
easily
and
insisted
that
she
must
have
change
mental
and
physical
so
her
brothers
took
her
to
switzerland
being
a
sensible
girl
when
she
went
abroad
she
threw
herself
at
once
into
the
interests
of
the
country
she
was
in
she
dried
plants
she
made
sketches
she
went
up
mountains
and
as
autumn
came
on
she
was
the
person
who
urged
that
they
should
return
to
croglin
grange
have
taken
it
she
said
seven
years
and
we
have
only
been
there
one
and
we
shall
always
find
it
difficult
to
let
a
house
which
is
only
one
story
high
so
we
had
better
return
there
lunatics
do
not
escape
every
day
as
she
urged
it
her
brothers
wished
nothing
better
and
the
family
returned
to
cumberland
from
there
being
no
upstairs
to
the
house
it
was
impossible
to
make
any
great
change
in
their
arrangements
the
sister
occupied
the
same
room
but
it
is
unnecessary
to
say
she
always
closed
her
shutters
which
however
as
in
many
old
houses
always
left
one
top
pane
of
the
window
uncovered
the
brothers
moved
and
occupied
a
room
together
exactly
opposite
that
of
their
sister
and
they
always
kept
loaded
pistols
in
their
room
the
winter
passed
most
peacefully
and
happily
in
the
following
march
the
sister
was
suddenly
awakened
by
a
sound
she
remembered
only
too
well
scratch
scratch
scratch
upon
the
window
and
looking
up
she
saw
quite
clearly
in
the
topmost
pane
of
the
window
the
same
hideous
brown
shrivelled
face
with
glaring
eyes
looking
in
at
her
this
time
she
screamed
as
loud
as
she
could
her
brothers
rushed
out
of
their
room
with
pistols
and
out
of
the
front
door
the
creature
was
already
scudding
away
across
the
lawn
one
of
the
brothers
fired
and
hit
it
in
the
leg
but
still
with
the
other
leg
it
continued
to
make
way
scrambled
over
the
wall
into
the
churchyard
and
seemed
to
disappear
into
a
vault
which
belonged
to
a
family
long
extinct
the
next
day
the
brothers
summoned
all
the
tenants
of
croglin
grange
and
in
their
presence
the
vault
was
opened
a
horrible
scene
revealed
itself
the
vault
was
full
of
coffins
they
had
been
broken
open
and
their
contents
horribly
mangled
and
distorted
were
scattered
over
the
floor
one
coffin
alone
remained
intact
of
that
the
lid
had
been
lifted
but
still
lay
loose
upon
the
coffin
they
raised
it
and
there
brown
withered
shrivelled
mummified
but
quite
entire
was
the
same
hideous
figure
which
had
looked
in
at
the
windows
of
croglin
grange
with
the
marks
of
a
recent
in
the
leg
and

did

the
ghost

by

concerning
the
apparition
of
the
ghost
of
major
george
sydenham
late
of
dulverton
in
the
county
of
somerset
to
captain
william
dyke
late
of
skilgate
in
this
county
also
and
now
likewise
deceased
be
pleased
to
take
the
relation
of
it
as
i
have
it
from
the
worthy
and
learned
dr
tho
dyke
a
near
kinsman
of
the
captain
thus
shortly
after
the
death
the
doctor
was
desired
to
come
to
the
house
to
take
care
of
a
child
that
was
there
sick
and
in
his
way
thither
he
called
on
the
captain
who
was
very
willing
to
wait
on
him
to
the
place
because
he
must
as
he
said
have
gone
thither
that
night
though
he
had
not
met
with
so
encouraging
an
opportunity
after
their
arrival
there
at
the
house
and
the
civility
of
the
people
shewn
them
in
that
entertainment
they
were
seasonably
conducted
to
their
lodging
which
they
desired
might
be
together
in
the
same
bed
where
after
they
had
lain
a
while
the
captain
knocked
and
bids
the
servant
bring
him
two
of
the
largest
and
biggest
candles
lighted
that
he
could
get
whereupon
the
doctor
enquires
what
he
meant
by
this
the
captain
answers
you
know
cousin
what
disputes
my
major
and
i
have
had
touching
the
being
of
a
god
and
the
immortality
of
the
soul
in
which
points
we
could
never
yet
be
resolv
though
we
so
much
sought
for
and
desired
it
and
therefore
it
was
at
length
fully
agreed
between
us
that
he
of
us
that
died
first
should
the
third
night
after
his
funeral
between
the
hours
of
twelve
and
one
come
to
the
little
house
that
is
here
in
the
garden
and
there
give
a
full
account
to
the
survivor
touching
these
matters
who
should
be
sure
to
be
present
there
at
the
set
time
and
so
receive
a
full
satisfaction
and
this
says
the
captain
is
the
very
night
and
i
am
come
on
purpose
to
fulfil
my
promise
the
doctor
dissuaded
him
minding
him
of
the
danger
of
following
those
strange
counsels
for
which
we
could
have
no
warrant
and
that
the
devil
might
by
some
cunning
device
make
such
an
advantage
of
this
rash
attempt
as
might
work
his
utter
ruin
the
captain
replies
that
he
had
solemnly
engag
and
that
nothing
should
discourage
him
and
adds
that
if
the
doctor
would
wake
awhile
with
him
he
would
thank
him
if
not
he
might
compose
himself
to
his
rest
but
for
his
own
part
he
was
resolv
to
watch
that
he
might
be
sure
to
be
present
at
the
hour
appointed
to
that
purpose
he
sets
his
watch
by
him
and
as
soon
as
he
perceived
by
it
that
it
was
half
an
hour
past
he
rises
and
taking
a
candle
in
each
hand
goes
out
by
a
of
which
he
had
before
gotten
the
key
and
walks
to
the
where
he
continued
two
hours
and
a
half
and
at
his
return
declared
that
he
had
neither
saw
not
heard
any
thing
more
than
what
was
usual
but
i
know
said
he
that
my
major
would
surely
have
come
had
he
been
able
about
weeks
after
the
captain
rides
to
to
place
his
son
a
scholar
there
when
the
doctor
went
thither
with
him
they
lodged
there
at
an
inn
the
sign
was
the
and
tarried
two
or
three
nights
not
lying
together
now
as
before
at
but
in
two
several
chambers
the
morning
before
they
went
thence
the
captain
staid
in
his
chamber
longer
than
he
was
wont
to
do
before
he
called
upon
the
doctor
at
length
he
comes
into
the
doctor
chamber
but
in
a
visage
and
form
much
differing
from
himself
with
his
hair
and
eyes
staring
and
his
whole
body
shaking
and
trembling
whereupon
at
the
doctor
wondering
presently
demanded
what
is
the
matter
cousin
captain
the
captain
replies
i
have
seen
my
major
at
which
the
doctor
seeming
to
smile
the
captain
immediately
confirms
it
saying
if
ever
i
saw
him
in
my
life
i
saw
him
but
now
and
then
he
related
to
the
doctor
what
had
passed
thus
this
morning
after
it
was
light
someone
comes
to
my
bedside
and
suddenly
drawing
back
the
curtains
calls
which
was
the
term
of
familiarity
that
the
major
used
to
call
the
captain
by
to
whom
i
replied
my
major
to
which
he
returns
could
not
come
at
the
time
appointed
but
i
am
now
come
to
tell
you
that
there
is
a
god
and
a
very
just
and
terrible
one
and
if
you
do
not
turn
over
a
new
the
very
expressions
as
is
by
the
doctor
punctually
remembered
will
find
it
the
captain
proceeded
on
the
table
by
there
lay
a
sword
which
the
major
had
formerly
given
me
now
after
the
apparition
had
walked
a
turn
or
two
about
the
chamber
he
took
up
the
sword
drew
it
out
and
finding
it
not
so
clean
and
bright
as
it
ought
says
he
sword
did
not
use
to
be
kept
after
this
manner
when
it
was
after
which
words
he
suddenly
disappeared
the
captain
was
not
only
thoroughly
persuaded
of
what
he
had
thus
seen
and
heard
but
was
from
that
time
observed
to
be
very
much
affected
with
it
and
the
humour
that
before
in
him
was
brisk
and
jovial
was
then
strangely
alter
insomuch
as
very
little
meat
would
pass
down
with
him
at
dinner
though
at
the
taking
leave
of
their
friends
there
was
a
very
handsome
treat
provided
yea
it
was
observed
that
what
the
captain
had
thus
seen
and
heard
had
a
more
lasting
influence
upon
him
and
is
judged
by
those
who
were
well
acquainted
with
his
conversation
that
the
remembrance
of
this
passage
stuck
close
to
him
and
that
those
words
of
his
dead
friend
were
frequently
sounding
fresh
in
his
ears
during
the
remainder
of
his
life
which
was
about
two
years

so
many

i

to
replace
some
of
these
articles
of
furniture
by
more
modern
ones
in
the
hope
of
removing
a
certain
air
of
gloom
which
i
thought
might
have
given
rise
to
the
unaccountable
reports
of
apparitions
and
extraordinary
noises
which
were
constantly
reaching
us
but
i
regret
to
say
i
did
not
succeed
in
banishing
the
nocturnal
visitor
which
still
continues
to
disturb
our
friends
i
shall
pass
over
numerous
instances
and
select
one
as
being
especially
remarkable
from
the
circumstance
of
the
apparition
having
been
seen
by
a
clergyman
well
known
and
highly
respected
in
this
county
who
not
six
weeks
ago
repeated
the
circumstances
to
a
company
of
twenty
persons
amongst
whom
were
some
who
had
previously
been
entire
disbelievers
in
such
appearances
the
best
way
of
giving
you
these
particulars
will
be
by
subjoining
an
extract
from
my
journal
entered
at
the
time
the
event
occurred
amongst
other
guests
invited
to
corby
castle
came
the
rev
henry
of
redburgh
and
rector
of
greystoke
with
mrs
his
wife
who
was
a
miss
of
ulverstone
according
to
previous
arrangements
they
were
to
have
remained
with
us
some
days
but
their
visit
was
cut
short
in
a
very
unexpected
manner
on
the
morning
after
their
arrival
we
were
all
assembled
at
breakfast
when
a
chaise
and
four
dashed
up
to
the
door
in
such
haste
that
it
knocked
down
part
of
the
fence
of
my
flower
garden
our
curiosity
was
of
course
awakened
to
know
who
could
be
arriving
at
so
early
an
hour
when
happening
to
turn
my
eyes
towards
mr
i
observed
that
he
appeared
extremely
agitated
it
is
our
carriage
said
he
i
am
very
sorry
but
we
must
absolutely
leave
you
this
morning
we
naturally
felt
and
expressed
considerable
surprise
as
well
as
regret
at
this
unexpected
departure
representing
that
we
had
invited
colonel
and
mrs
some
friends
whom
mr
particularly
desired
to
meet
to
dine
with
us
on
that
day
our
expostulations
however
were
vain
the
breakfast
was
no
sooner
over
than
they
departed
leaving
us
in
consternation
to
conjecture
what
could
possibly
have
occasioned
so
sudden
an
alteration
in
their
arrangements
i
really
felt
quite
uneasy
lest
anything
should
have
given
them
offence
and
we
reviewed
all
the
occurrences
of
the
preceding
evening
in
order
to
discover
if
offence
there
was
whence
it
had
arisen
but
our
pains
were
vain
and
after
talking
a
great
deal
about
it
for
some
days
other
circumstances
banished
the
matter
from
our
minds
it
was
not
till
we
some
time
afterwards
visited
the
part
of
the
county
in
which
mr
resides
that
we
learnt
the
real
cause
of
his
sudden
departure
from
corby
the
relation
of
the
fact
as
it
here
follows
is
in
his
own
words
soon
after
we
went
to
bed
we
fell
asleep
it
might
be
between
one
and
two
in
the
morning
when
i
awoke
i
observed
that
the
fire
was
totally
extinguished
but
although
that
was
the
case
and
we
had
no
light
i
saw
a
glimmer
in
the
centre
of
the
room
which
suddenly
increased
to
a
bright
flame
i
looked
out
apprehending
that
something
had
caught
fire
when
to
my
amazement
i
beheld
a
beautiful
boy
clothed
in
white
with
bright
locks
resembling
gold
standing
by
my
bedside
in
which
position
he
remained
some
minutes
fixing
his
eyes
upon
me
with
a
mild
and
benevolent
expression
he
then
glided
gently
towards
the
side
of
the
chimney
where
it
is
obvious
there
is
no
possible
egress
and
entirely
disappeared
i
found
myself
again
in
total
darkness
and
all
remained
quiet
until
the
usual
hour
of
rising
i
declare
this
to
be
a
true
account
of
what
i
saw
at
corby
castle
upon
my
word
as
a
clergyman
mrs
crowe
alluding
to
this
story
in
her
night
side
of
nature
said
that
she
was
acquainted
with
some
of
the
family
and
several
of
the
friends
of
the
rev
henry
who
she
continued
is
still
alive
though
now
an
old
man
and
i
can
most
positively
assert
that
his
own
conviction
with
regard
to
the
nature
of
this
appearance
has
remained
ever
unshaken
the
circumstance
made
a
lasting
impression
upon
his
mind
and
he
never
willingly
speaks
of
it
but
when
he
does
it
is
always
with
the
greatest
seriousness
and
he
never
shrinks
from
avowing
his
belief
that
what
he
saw
admits
of
no
other
interpretation
than
the
one
he

xxv
dorothy
durant
by
mrs
crowe
a
schoolboy
named
bligh
who
went
to
launceston
grammar
school
of
which
the
rev
john
ruddle
was
headmaster
from
being
a
lad
of
bright
parts
and
no
common
attainments
became
on
a
sudden
moody
dejected
and
melancholy
his
friends
seeing
the
change
without
being
able
to
find
the
cause
attributed
it
to
laziness
an
aversion
to
school
or
to
some
other
motive
which
he
was
ashamed
to
avow
he
was
led
however
to
tell
his
brother
after
some
time
that
in
a
field
through
which
he
passed
to
and
from
school
he
invariably
met
the
apparition
of
a
woman
whom
he
personally
knew
while
living
and
who
had
been
dead
about
eight
years
ridicule
threats
persuasions
were
alike
used
in
vain
by
the
family
to
induce
him
to
dismiss
these
absurd
ideas
finally
mr
ruddle
was
sent
for
and
to
him
the
boy
ingenuously
told
the
time
manner
and
frequency
of
this
appearance
it
was
in
a
field
called
higher
broomfield
the
apparition
he
said
appeared
dressed
in
female
attire
met
him
two
or
three
times
while
he
passed
through
the
field
glided
hastily
by
him
but
never
spoke
he
had
thus
been
occasionally
met
about
two
months
before
he
took
any
particular
notice
of
it
at
length
the
appearance
became
more
frequent
meeting
him
both
morning
and
evening
but
always
in
the
same
field
yet
invariably
moving
out
of
the
path
when
it
came
close
to
him
he
often
spoke
but
could
never
get
any
reply
to
avoid
this
unwelcome
visitor
he
forsook
the
field
and
went
to
school
and
returned
from
it
through
a
lane
in
which
place
between
the
quarry
pack
and
nursery
it
always
met
him
unable
to
disbelieve
the
evidence
of
his
own
senses
or
to
obtain
credit
with
any
of
his
family
he
prevailed
upon
mr
ruddle
to
accompany
him
to
the
place
i
arose
says
this
clergyman
the
next
morning
and
went
with
him
the
field
to
which
he
led
me
i
guessed
to
be
about
twenty
acres
in
an
open
country
and
about
three
furlongs
from
any
house
we
went
into
the
field
and
had
not
gone
a
third
part
before
the
spectrum
in
the
shape
of
a
woman
with
all
the
circumstances
he
had
described
the
day
before
so
far
as
the
suddenness
of
its
appearance
and
transition
would
permit
me
to
discover
passed
by
i
was
a
little
surprised
at
it
and
though
i
had
taken
up
a
firm
resolution
to
speak
to
it
i
had
not
the
power
nor
durst
i
look
back
yet
i
took
care
not
to
show
any
fear
to
my
pupil
and
guide
and
therefore
telling
him
i
was
satisfied
of
the
truth
of
his
statement
we
walked
to
the
end
of
the
field
and
returned
nor
did
the
ghost
meet
us
that
time
but
once
on
the
july
i
went
to
the
haunted
field
by
myself
and
walked
the
breadth
of
it
without
any
encounter
i
then
returned
and
took
the
other
walk
and
then
the
spectre
appeared
to
me
much
about
the
same
place
in
which
i
saw
it
when
the
young
gentleman
was
with
me
it
appeared
to
move
swifter
than
before
and
seemed
to
be
about
ten
feet
from
me
on
my
right
hand
insomuch
that
i
had
not
time
to
speak
to
it
as
i
had
determined
with
myself
beforehand
the
evening
of
this
day
the
parents
the
son
and
myself
being
in
the
chamber
where
i
lay
i
proposed
to
them
our
going
altogether
to
the
place
next
morning
we
accordingly
met
at
the
stile
we
had
appointed
thence
we
all
four
walked
into
the
field
together
we
had
not
gone
more
than
half
the
field
before
the
ghost
made
its
appearance
it
then
came
over
the
stile
just
before
us
and
moved
with
such
rapidity
that
by
the
time
we
had
gone
six
or
seven
steps
it
passed
by
i
immediately
turned
my
head
and
ran
after
it
with
the
young
man
by
my
side
we
saw
it
pass
over
the
stile
at
which
we
entered
and
no
farther
i
stepped
upon
the
hedge
at
one
place
and
the
young
man
at
another
but
we
could
discern
nothing
whereas
i
do
aver
that
the
swiftest
horse
in
england
could
not
have
conveyed
himself
out
of
sight
in
that
short
space
of
time
two
things
i
observed
in
this
day
appearance
first
a
spaniel
dog
which
had
followed
the
company
unregarded
barked
and
ran
away
as
the
spectrum
passed
by
whence
it
is
easy
to
conclude
that
it
was
not
our
fear
or
fancy
which
made
the
apparition
secondly
the
motion
of
the
spectrum
was
not
or
by
steps
or
moving
of
the
feet
but
by
a
kind
of
gliding
as
children
upon
ice
or
as
a
boat
down
a
river
which
punctually
answers
the
description
the
ancients
give
of
the
motion
of
these
lamures
this
ocular
evidence
clearly
convinced
but
withal
strangely
affrighted
the
old
gentleman
and
his
wife
they
well
knew
this
woman
dorothy
durant
in
her
were
at
her
burial
and
now
plainly
saw
her
features
in
this
apparition
the
next
morning
being
thursday
i
went
very
early
by
myself
and
walked
for
about
an
hour
space
in
meditation
and
prayer
in
the
field
next
adjoining
soon
after
five
i
stepped
over
the
stile
into
the
haunted
field
and
had
not
gone
above
thirty
or
forty
paces
before
the
ghost
appeared
at
the
further
stile
i
spoke
to
it
in
some
short
sentences
with
a
loud
voice
whereupon
it
approached
me
but
slowly
and
when
i
came
near
it
moved
not
i
spoke
again
and
it
answered
in
a
voice
neither
audible
nor
very
intelligible
i
was
not
in
the
least
terrified
and
therefore
persisted
until
it
spoke
again
and
gave
me
satisfaction
but
the
work
could
not
be
finished
at
this
time
whereupon
the
same
evening
an
hour
after
sunset
it
met
me
again
near
the
same
place
and
after
a
few
words
on
each
side
it
quietly
vanished
and
neither
doth
appear
now
nor
hath
appeared
since
nor
ever
will
more
to
any
disturbance
the
discourse
in
the
morning
lasted
about
a
quarter
of
an
hour
these
things
are
true
concludes
the
rev
john
ruddle
and
i
know
them
to
be
so
with
as
much
certainty
as
eyes
and
ears
can
give
me
and
until
i
can
be
persuaded
that
my
senses
all
deceive
me
about
their
proper
objects
and
by
that
persuasion
deprive
me
of
the
strongest
inducement
to
believe
the
christian
religion
i
must
and
will
assert
that
the
things
contained
in
this
paper
are
true
xxvi
pearlin
jean
by
charles
kirkpatrick
sharpe
it
was
charles
kirkpatrick
sharpe
the
antiquary
who
furnished
this
account
of
pearlin
jean
hauntings
at
allanbank
in
my
youth
he
says
pearlin
jean
was
the
most
remarkable
ghost
in
scotland
and
my
terror
when
a
child
our
old
nurse
jenny
blackadder
had
been
a
servant
at
allanbank
and
often
heard
her
rustling
in
silks
up
and
down
stairs
and
along
the
passages
she
never
saw
her
but
her
husband
did
she
was
a
french
woman
whom
the
first
baronet
of
allanbank
then
mr
stuart
met
with
at
paris
during
his
tour
to
finish
his
education
as
a
gentleman
some
people
said
she
was
a
nun
in
which
case
she
must
have
been
a
sister
of
charity
as
she
appears
not
to
have
been
confined
to
a
cloister
after
some
time
young
stuart
either
became
faithless
to
the
lady
or
was
suddenly
recalled
to
scotland
by
his
parents
and
had
got
into
his
carriage
at
the
door
of
the
hotel
when
his
dido
unexpectedly
made
her
appearance
and
stepping
on
the
forewheel
of
the
coach
to
address
her
lover
he
ordered
the
postilion
to
drive
on
the
consequence
of
which
was
that
the
lady
fell
and
one
of
the
wheels
going
over
her
forehead
killed
her
in
a
dusky
autumnal
evening
when
mr
stuart
drove
under
the
arched
gateway
of
allanbank
he
perceived
pearlin
jean
sitting
on
the
top
her
head
and
shoulders
covered
with
blood
after
this
for
many
years
the
house
was
haunted
doors
shut
and
opened
with
great
noise
at
midnight
the
rustling
of
silks
and
pattering
of
shoes
were
heard
in
bedrooms
and
passages
nurse
jenny
said
there
were
seven
ministers
called
in
together
at
one
time
to
the
spirit
they
did
no
mickle
good
my
dear
the
picture
of
the
ghost
was
hung
between
those
of
her
lover
and
his
lady
and
kept
her
comparatively
quiet
but
when
taken
away
she
became
than
ever
this
portrait
was
in
the
present
sir
possession
i
am
unwilling
to
record
its
fate
the
ghost
was
designated
pearlin
from
always
wearing
a
great
quantity
of
that
sort
of
lace
nurse
jenny
told
me
that
when
thomas
blackadder
was
her
lover
i
remember
thomas
very
well
they
made
an
assignation
to
meet
one
moonlight
night
in
the
orchard
at
allanbank
true
thomas
of
course
was
the
first
comer
and
seeing
a
female
figure
in
a
dress
at
some
distance
he
ran
forward
with
open
arms
to
embrace
his
jenny
when
lo
and
behold
as
he
neared
the
spot
where
the
figure
stood
it
vanished
and
presently
he
saw
it
again
at
the
very
end
of
the
orchard
a
considerable
way
off
thomas
went
home
in
a
fright
but
jenny
who
came
last
and
saw
nothing
forgave
him
and
they
were
married
many
years
after
this
about
the
year
two
ladies
paid
a
visit
at
allanbank
i
think
the
house
was
then
let
and
passed
the
night
there
they
had
never
heard
a
word
about
the
ghost
but
they
were
disturbed
the
whole
night
with
something
walking
backwards
and
forwards
in
their
this
i
had
from
the
best
authority
to
this
account
may
be
added
that
a
housekeeper
called
betty
norrie
who
in
more
recent
times
lived
many
years
at
allanbank
positively
averred
that
she
and
many
other
persons
had
frequently
seen
pearlin
jean
and
moreover
stated
that
they
were
so
used
to
her
as
to
be
no
longer
alarmed
at
the
noises
she
made
xxvii
the
denton
hall
ghost
local
records
a
day
or
two
after
my
arrival
at
denton
hall
when
all
around
was
yet
new
to
me
i
had
accompanied
my
friends
to
a
ball
given
in
the
neighbourhood
and
returned
heartily
fatigued
at
this
time
i
need
not
blush
nor
you
smile
when
i
say
that
on
that
evening
i
had
met
for
the
second
time
one
with
whose
destinies
my
own
were
doomed
to
become
connected
i
think
i
was
sitting
upon
an
antique
carved
chair
near
to
the
fire
in
the
room
where
i
slept
busied
in
arranging
my
hair
and
thinking
over
some
of
the
events
of
the
day
whether
i
had
dropped
into
a
i
can
not
say
but
on
looking
up
for
i
had
my
face
bent
toward
the
fire
there
seemed
sitting
on
a
similar
highbacked
chair
on
the
other
side
of
the
ancient
tiled
fireplace
an
old
lady
whose
air
and
dress
were
so
remarkable
that
to
this
hour
they
seem
as
fresh
in
my
memory
as
they
were
the
day
after
the
vision
she
appeared
to
be
dressed
in
a
flowered
satin
gown
of
a
cut
then
out
of
date
it
was
peaked
and
the
fabric
of
the
satin
had
that
extreme
of
glossy
stiffness
which
old
fabrics
of
this
kind
exhibit
she
wore
a
stomacher
on
her
wrinkled
fingers
appeared
some
rings
of
great
size
and
seeming
value
but
what
was
most
remarkable
she
wore
also
a
satin
hood
of
a
peculiar
shape
it
was
glossy
like
the
gown
but
seemed
to
be
stiffened
either
by
whalebone
or
some
other
material
her
age
seemed
considerable
and
the
face
though
not
unpleasant
was
somewhat
hard
and
severe
and
indented
with
minute
wrinkles
i
confess
that
so
entirely
was
my
attention
engrossed
by
what
was
passing
in
my
mind
that
though
i
felt
mightily
confused
i
was
not
startled
in
the
emphatic
sense
by
the
apparition
in
fact
i
deemed
it
to
be
some
old
lady
perhaps
a
housekeeper
or
dependent
in
the
family
and
therefore
though
rather
astonished
was
by
no
means
frightened
by
my
visitant
supposing
me
to
be
awake
which
i
am
convinced
was
the
case
though
few
persons
believe
me
on
this
point
my
own
impression
is
that
i
stared
somewhat
rudely
in
the
wonder
of
the
moment
at
the
hard
but
features
of
my
aged
visitor
but
she
left
me
small
time
to
think
addressing
me
in
a
familiar
and
with
a
constant
restless
motion
of
the
hand
which
aged
persons
when
excited
often
exhibit
in
addressing
the
young
well
young
lady
said
my
mysterious
companion
and
so
you
been
at
yon
hall
and
highly
ye
been
delighted
there
yet
if
you
could
see
as
i
can
see
or
could
know
as
i
can
know
troth
i
guess
your
pleasure
would
abate
is
well
for
you
young
lady
peradventure
ye
see
not
with
my
eyes
and
at
the
moment
sure
enough
her
eyes
which
were
small
grey
and
in
no
way
remarkable
twinkled
with
a
light
so
severe
that
the
effect
was
unpleasant
in
the
extreme
is
well
for
you
and
them
she
continued
that
ye
can
not
count
the
cost
time
was
when
hospitality
could
be
kept
in
england
and
the
guest
not
ruin
the
master
of
the
feast
but
all
vanished
now
pride
and
poverty
pride
and
poverty
young
lady
are
an
pair
heaven
kens
my
tongue
which
had
at
first
almost
faltered
in
its
office
now
found
utterance
by
a
kind
of
instinct
i
addressed
my
strange
visitant
in
her
own
manner
and
humour
and
are
we
then
so
much
poorer
than
in
days
of
yore
were
the
words
that
i
spoke
my
visitor
seemed
half
startled
at
the
sound
of
my
voice
as
at
something
unaccustomed
and
went
on
rather
answering
my
question
by
implication
than
directly
was
not
all
hollowness
then
she
exclaimed
ceasing
somewhat
her
hollow
whisper
the
land
was
then
the
lord
and
that
which
the
child
young
lady
was
not
then
mortgaged
in
the
cradle
and
mark
ye
the
bride
when
she
kneeled
at
the
altar
gave
not
herself
up
body
and
soul
to
be
the
bondswoman
of
the
jew
but
to
be
the
helpmate
of
the
spouse
the
jew
i
exclaimed
in
surprise
for
then
i
understood
not
the
allusion
ay
young
lady
the
jew
was
the
rejoinder
is
plain
ye
know
not
who
rules
is
all
hollow
yonder
all
hollow
all
hollow
to
the
very
glitter
of
the
all
false
all
false
all
hollow
away
with
such
finery
and
here
again
the
hollow
voice
rose
a
little
and
the
dim
grey
eye
glistened
ye
mortgage
the
very
oaks
of
your
ancestors
i
saw
the
planting
of
them
and
now
is
all
painting
gilding
varnishing
and
veneering
houses
call
ye
them
whited
sepulchres
young
lady
whited
sepulchres
trust
not
all
that
seems
to
glisten
fair
though
it
seems
is
but
the
product
of
disease
even
as
is
the
pearl
in
your
hair
young
lady
that
glitters
in
the
mirror
yonder
not
more
specious
than
is
all
ay
ye
have
seen
as
my
strange
visitor
pronounced
these
words
i
instinctively
turned
my
gaze
to
a
large
mirror
that
leaned
from
the
wall
of
the
chamber
was
but
for
a
moment
but
when
i
again
turned
my
head
my
visitant
was
no
longer
there
i
heard
plainly
as
i
turned
the
distinct
rustle
of
the
silk
as
if
she
had
risen
and
was
leaving
the
room
i
seemed
distinctly
to
hear
this
together
with
the
quick
short
easy
footstep
with
which
females
of
rank
of
that
period
were
taught
to
glide
rather
than
to
walk
this
i
seemed
to
hear
but
of
what
appeared
the
antique
old
lady
i
saw
no
more
the
suddenness
and
strangeness
of
this
event
for
a
moment
sent
the
blood
back
to
my
heart
could
i
have
found
voice
i
should
i
think
have
screamed
but
that
was
for
a
moment
beyond
my
power
a
few
seconds
recovered
me
by
a
sort
of
impulse
i
rushed
to
the
door
outside
which
i
now
heard
the
footsteps
of
some
of
the
family
when
to
my
utter
astonishment
i
found
it
was
locked
i
now
recollected
that
i
myself
locked
it
before
sitting
down
though
somewhat
ashamed
to
give
utterance
to
what
i
really
believed
as
to
this
matter
the
strange
adventure
of
the
night
was
made
a
subject
of
conversation
at
the
next
morning
on
the
words
leaving
my
lips
i
saw
my
host
and
hostess
exchange
looks
with
each
other
and
soon
found
that
the
tale
i
had
to
tell
was
not
received
with
the
air
which
generally
meets
such
relations
i
was
not
repelled
by
an
angry
or
incredulity
or
treated
as
one
of
diseased
fancy
to
whom
silence
is
indirectly
recommended
as
the
alternative
of
being
laughed
at
in
short
it
was
not
attempted
to
be
denied
or
concealed
that
i
was
not
the
first
who
had
been
alarmed
in
a
manner
if
not
exactly
similar
yet
just
as
mysterious
that
visitors
like
myself
had
actually
given
way
to
these
terrors
so
far
as
to
quit
the
house
in
consequence
and
that
servants
were
sometimes
not
to
be
prevented
from
sharing
in
the
same
contagion
at
the
same
time
they
told
me
this
my
host
and
hostess
declared
that
custom
and
continued
residence
had
long
exempted
all
regular
inmates
of
the
mansion
from
any
alarms
or
terrors
the
visitations
whatever
they
were
seemed
to
be
confined
to
newcomers
and
to
them
it
was
by
no
means
a
matter
of
frequent
occurrence
in
the
neighbourhood
i
found
this
strange
story
was
well
known
that
the
house
was
regularly
set
down
as
haunted
all
the
country
round
and
that
the
spirit
or
goblin
or
whatever
it
was
that
was
embodied
in
these
appearances
was
familiarly
known
by
the
name
of
silky
at
a
distance
those
to
whom
i
have
related
my
night
adventure
have
one
and
all
been
sceptical
and
accounted
for
the
whole
by
supposing
me
to
have
been
half
asleep
or
in
a
state
resembling
somnambulism
all
i
can
say
is
that
my
own
impressions
are
directly
contrary
to
this
supposition
and
that
i
feel
as
sure
that
i
saw
the
figure
that
sat
before
me
with
my
bodily
eyes
as
i
am
sure
i
now
see
you
with
them
without
affecting
to
deny
that
i
was
somewhat
shocked
by
the
adventure
i
must
repeat
that
i
suffered
no
unreasonable
alarm
nor
suffered
my
fancy
to
overcome
my
better
spirit
of
womanhood
i
certainly
slept
no
more
in
that
room
and
in
that
to
which
i
removed
i
had
one
of
the
daughters
of
my
hostess
as
a
companion
but
i
have
never
from
that
hour
to
this
been
convinced
that
i
did
not
actually
encounter
something
more
than
is
natural
if
not
an
actual
being
in
some
other
state
of
existence
my
ears
have
not
been
deceived
if
my
eyes
were
which
i
repeat
i
can
not
believe
the
warnings
so
strongly
shadowed
forth
have
been
too
true
the
gentleman
at
whose
house
i
that
night
was
a
guest
has
long
since
filled
an
untimely
grave
in
that
splendid
hall
since
that
time
strangers
have
lorded
it
and
i
myself
have
long
since
ceased
to
think
of
such
scenes
as
i
partook
of
that
evening
the
envied
object
of
the
attention
of
one
whose
virtues
have
survived
the
splendid
inheritance
to
which
he
seemed
destined
whether
this
be
a
tale
of
delusion
and
superstition
or
something
more
than
that
it
is
at
all
events
not
without
a
legend
for
its
foundation
there
is
some
obscure
and
dark
rumour
of
secrets
strangely
obtained
and
enviously
betrayed
by
a
rival
sister
ending
in
deprivation
of
reason
and
death
and
that
the
betrayer
still
walks
by
times
in
the
deserted
hall
which
she
rendered
tenantless
always
prophetic
of
disaster
to
those
she
encounters
so
has
it
been
with
me
certainly
and
more
than
me
if
those
who
say
it
say
true
it
is
many
many
years
since
i
saw
the
scene
of
this
adventure
but
i
have
heard
that
since
that
time
the
same
mysterious
visitings
have
more
than
once
been
renewed
that
midnight
curtains
have
been
drawn
by
an
arm
clothed
in
rustling
silks
and
the
same
form
clad
in
dark
brocade
has
been
seen
gliding
along
the
dark
corridors
of
that
ancient
grey
and
mansion
ever
prophetic
of
death
or
misfortune
xxviii
the
goodwood
ghost
story
doubtfully
attributed
to
charles
dickens
my
wife
sister
mrs
m
was
left
a
widow
at
the
age
of
with
two
children
girls
of
whom
she
was
passionately
fond
she
carried
on
the
draper
business
at
bognor
established
by
her
husband
being
still
a
very
handsome
woman
there
were
several
suitors
for
her
hand
the
only
favoured
one
amongst
them
was
a
mr
barton
my
wife
never
liked
this
mr
barton
and
made
no
secret
of
her
feelings
to
her
sister
whom
she
frequently
told
that
mr
barton
only
wanted
to
be
master
of
the
little
haberdashery
shop
in
bognor
he
was
a
man
in
poor
circumstances
and
had
no
other
motive
in
his
proposal
of
marriage
so
my
wife
thought
than
to
better
himself
on
the
of
august
mrs
m
arranged
to
go
with
barton
to
a
picnic
party
at
goodwood
park
the
seat
of
the
duke
of
richmond
who
had
kindly
thrown
open
his
grounds
to
the
public
for
the
day
my
wife
a
little
annoyed
at
her
going
out
with
this
man
told
her
she
had
much
better
remain
at
home
to
look
after
her
children
and
attend
to
the
business
mrs
m
however
bent
on
going
made
arrangements
about
leaving
the
shop
and
got
my
wife
to
promise
to
see
to
her
little
girls
while
she
was
away
the
party
set
out
in
a
phaeton
with
a
pair
of
ponies
driven
by
mrs
m
and
a
gig
for
which
i
lent
the
horse
now
we
did
not
expect
them
to
come
back
till
nine
or
ten
at
any
rate
i
mention
this
particularly
to
show
that
there
could
be
no
expectation
of
their
earlier
return
in
the
mind
of
my
wife
to
account
for
what
follows
at
six
that
bright
summer
evening
my
wife
went
out
into
the
garden
to
call
the
children
not
finding
them
she
went
all
round
the
place
in
her
search
till
she
came
to
the
empty
stable
thinking
they
might
have
run
in
there
to
play
she
pushed
open
the
door
there
standing
in
the
darkest
corner
she
saw
mrs
m
my
wife
was
surprised
to
see
her
certainly
for
she
did
not
expect
her
return
so
soon
but
oddly
enough
it
did
not
strike
her
as
being
singular
to
see
her
vexed
as
she
had
felt
with
her
all
day
for
going
and
rather
glad
in
her
woman
way
to
have
something
entirely
different
from
the
genuine
to
hang
a
retort
upon
my
wife
said
well
harriet
i
should
have
thought
another
dress
would
have
done
quite
as
well
for
your
picnic
as
that
best
black
silk
you
have
on
my
wife
was
the
elder
of
the
twain
and
had
always
assumed
a
little
of
the
air
of
counsellor
to
her
sister
black
silks
were
thought
a
great
deal
more
of
at
that
time
than
they
are
just
now
and
silk
of
any
kind
was
held
particularly
inconsistent
wear
for
wesleyan
methodists
to
which
denomination
we
belonged
receiving
no
answer
my
wife
said
oh
well
harriet
if
you
ca
take
a
word
of
reproof
without
being
sulky
i
leave
you
to
yourself
and
then
she
came
into
the
house
to
tell
me
the
party
had
returned
and
that
she
had
seen
her
sister
in
the
stable
not
in
the
best
of
tempers
at
the
moment
it
did
not
seem
extraordinary
to
me
that
my
wife
should
have
met
her
sister
in
the
stable
i
waited
indoors
some
time
expecting
them
to
return
my
horse
mrs
m
was
my
neighbour
and
being
always
on
most
friendly
terms
i
wondered
that
none
of
the
party
had
come
in
to
tell
us
about
the
day
pleasure
i
thought
i
would
just
run
in
and
see
how
they
had
got
on
to
my
great
surprise
the
servant
told
me
they
had
not
returned
i
began
then
to
feel
anxiety
about
the
result
my
wife
however
having
seen
harriet
in
the
stable
refused
to
believe
the
servant
assertion
and
said
there
was
no
doubt
of
their
return
but
that
they
had
probably
left
word
to
say
they
were
not
come
back
in
order
to
offer
a
plausible
excuse
for
taking
a
further
drive
and
detaining
my
horse
for
another
hour
or
so
at
eleven
mr
pinnock
my
who
had
been
one
of
the
party
came
in
apparently
much
agitated
as
soon
as
she
saw
him
and
before
he
had
time
to
speak
my
wife
seemed
to
know
what
he
had
to
say
what
is
the
matter
she
said
something
has
happened
to
harriet
i
know
yes
replied
mr
pinnock
if
you
wish
to
see
her
alive
you
must
come
with
me
directly
to
goodwood
from
what
he
said
it
appeared
that
one
of
the
ponies
had
never
been
properly
broken
in
that
the
man
from
whom
the
was
hired
for
the
day
had
cautioned
mrs
m
respecting
it
before
they
started
and
that
he
had
lent
it
reluctantly
being
the
only
pony
to
match
in
the
stable
at
the
time
and
would
not
have
lent
it
at
all
had
he
not
known
mrs
m
to
be
a
remarkably
good
whip
on
reaching
goodwood
it
seems
the
gentlemen
of
the
party
had
got
out
leaving
the
ladies
to
take
a
drive
round
the
park
in
the
phaeton
one
or
both
of
the
ponies
must
then
have
taken
fright
at
something
in
the
road
for
mrs
m
had
scarcely
taken
the
reins
when
the
ponies
shied
had
there
been
plenty
of
room
she
would
readily
have
mastered
the
difficulty
but
it
was
in
a
narrow
road
where
a
gate
obstructed
the
way
some
men
rushed
to
open
the
gate
too
late
the
three
other
ladies
jumped
out
at
the
beginning
of
the
accident
but
mrs
m
still
held
on
to
the
reins
seeking
to
control
her
ponies
until
finding
it
was
impossible
for
the
men
to
get
the
gate
open
in
time
she
too
sprang
forward
and
at
the
same
instant
the
ponies
came
smash
on
to
the
gate
she
had
made
her
spring
too
late
and
fell
heavily
to
the
ground
on
her
head
the
heavy
comb
of
the
period
with
which
her
hair
was
looped
up
was
driven
into
her
skull
by
the
force
of
the
fall
the
duke
of
richmond
a
witness
to
the
accident
ran
to
her
assistance
lifted
her
up
and
rested
her
head
upon
his
knees
the
only
words
mrs
m
had
spoken
were
uttered
at
the
time
good
god
my
children
by
direction
of
the
duke
she
was
immediately
conveyed
to
a
neighbouring
inn
where
every
assistance
medical
and
otherwise
that
forethought
or
kindness
could
suggest
was
afforded
her
at
six
in
the
evening
the
time
at
which
my
wife
had
gone
into
the
stable
and
seen
what
we
now
knew
had
been
her
spirit
mrs
m
in
her
sole
interval
of
returning
consciousness
had
made
a
violent
but
unsuccessful
attempt
to
speak
from
her
glance
having
wandered
round
the
room
in
solemn
awful
wistfulness
it
had
been
conjectured
she
wished
to
see
some
relative
or
friend
not
then
present
i
went
to
goodwood
in
the
gig
with
mr
pinnock
and
arrived
in
time
to
see
my
die
at
two
in
the
morning
her
only
conscious
moments
had
been
those
in
which
she
laboured
unsuccessfully
to
speak
which
had
occurred
at
six
she
wore
a
black
silk
dress
when
we
came
to
dispose
of
her
business
and
to
wind
up
her
affairs
there
was
scarcely
anything
left
for
the
two
orphan
girls
mrs
m
father
however
being
took
them
to
bring
up
at
his
death
which
happened
soon
afterwards
his
property
went
to
his
eldest
son
who
speedily
dissipated
the
inheritance
during
a
space
of
two
years
the
children
were
taken
as
visitors
by
various
relations
in
turn
and
lived
an
unhappy
life
with
no
settled
home
for
some
time
i
had
been
debating
with
myself
how
to
help
these
children
having
many
boys
and
girls
of
my
own
to
provide
for
i
had
almost
settled
to
take
them
myself
bad
as
trade
was
with
me
at
the
time
and
bring
them
up
with
my
own
family
when
one
day
business
called
me
to
brighton
the
business
was
so
urgent
that
it
necessitated
my
travelling
at
night
i
set
out
from
bognor
in
a
gig
on
a
beautiful
moonlight
winter
night
when
the
crisp
frozen
snow
lay
deep
over
the
earth
and
its
fine
glistening
dust
was
whirled
about
in
little
eddies
on
the
bleak
driven
now
and
then
in
stinging
powder
against
my
tingling
cheek
warm
and
glowing
in
the
sharp
air
i
had
taken
my
great
bose
short
for
boatswain
for
company
he
lay
blinking
wakefully
sprawled
out
on
the
spare
seat
of
the
gig
beneath
a
mass
of
warm
rugs
between
littlehampton
and
worthing
is
a
lonely
piece
of
road
long
and
dreary
through
bleak
and
bare
open
country
where
the
snow
lay
sparkling
in
the
moonlight
it
was
so
cheerless
that
i
turned
round
to
speak
to
my
dog
more
for
the
sake
of
hearing
the
sound
of
a
voice
than
anything
else
good
bose
i
said
patting
him
there
a
good
dog
then
suddenly
i
noticed
he
shivered
and
shrank
underneath
the
wraps
then
the
horse
required
my
attention
for
he
gave
a
start
and
was
going
wrong
and
had
nearly
taken
me
into
the
ditch
then
i
looked
up
walking
at
my
horse
head
dressed
in
a
sweeping
robe
so
white
that
it
shone
dazzling
against
the
white
snow
i
saw
a
lady
her
back
turned
to
me
her
head
bare
her
hair
dishevelled
and
strayed
showing
sharp
and
black
against
her
white
dress
i
was
at
first
so
much
surprised
at
seeing
a
lady
so
dressed
exposed
to
the
open
night
and
such
a
night
as
this
that
i
scarcely
knew
what
to
do
recovering
myself
i
called
out
to
know
if
i
could
render
assistance
if
she
wished
to
ride
no
answer
i
drove
faster
the
horse
blinking
and
shying
and
trembling
the
while
his
ears
laid
back
in
abject
terror
still
the
figure
maintained
its
position
close
to
my
horse
head
then
i
thought
that
what
i
saw
was
no
woman
but
perchance
a
man
disguised
for
the
purpose
of
robbing
me
seeking
an
opportunity
to
seize
the
bridle
and
stop
the
horse
filled
with
this
idea
i
said
good
bose
hi
look
at
it
boy
but
the
dog
only
shivered
as
if
in
fright
then
we
came
to
a
place
where
four
meet
determined
to
know
the
worst
i
pulled
up
the
horse
i
fetched
bose
unwilling
out
by
the
ears
he
was
a
good
dog
at
anything
from
a
rat
to
a
man
but
he
slunk
away
that
night
into
the
hedge
and
lay
there
his
head
between
his
paws
whining
and
howling
i
walked
straight
up
to
the
figure
still
standing
by
the
horse
head
as
i
walked
the
figure
turned
and
i
saw
as
plainly
as
i
see
you
now
white
and
calm
placid
as
idealised
and
beautified
by
death
i
must
own
that
though
not
a
nervous
man
in
that
instant
i
felt
sick
and
faint
harriet
looked
me
full
in
the
face
with
a
long
eager
silent
look
i
knew
then
it
was
her
spirit
and
felt
a
strange
calm
come
over
me
for
i
knew
it
was
nothing
to
harm
me
when
i
could
speak
i
asked
what
troubled
her
she
looked
at
me
still
never
changing
that
cold
fixed
stare
then
i
felt
in
my
mind
it
was
her
children
and
i
said
harriet
is
it
for
your
children
you
are
troubled
no
answer
harriet
i
continued
if
for
these
you
are
troubled
be
assured
they
shall
never
want
while
i
have
power
to
help
them
rest
in
peace
still
no
answer
i
put
up
my
hand
to
wipe
from
my
forehead
the
cold
perspiration
which
had
gathered
there
when
i
took
my
hand
away
from
shading
my
eyes
the
figure
was
gone
i
was
alone
on
the
bleak
ground
the
breeze
that
had
been
hushed
before
breathed
coolly
and
gratefully
on
my
face
and
the
cold
stars
glimmered
and
sparkled
sharply
in
the
far
blue
heavens
my
dog
crept
up
to
me
and
furtively
licked
my
hand
as
who
would
say
good
master
do
be
angry
i
have
served
you
in
all
but
this
i
took
the
children
and
brought
them
up
till
they
could
help
themselves
xxix
captain
wheatcroft
from
dale
owen
footfalls
in
the
month
of
september
captain
german
wheatcroft
of
the
inniskilling
dragoons
went
out
to
india
to
join
his
regiment
his
wife
remained
in
england
residing
at
cambridge
on
the
night
between
the
and
of
november
towards
morning
she
dreamed
that
she
saw
her
husband
looking
anxious
and
ill
upon
which
she
immediately
awoke
much
agitated
it
was
bright
moonlight
and
looking
up
she
perceived
the
same
figure
standing
by
her
bedside
he
appeared
in
his
uniform
the
hands
pressed
across
the
breast
the
hair
dishevelled
the
face
very
pale
his
large
dark
eyes
were
fixed
full
upon
her
their
expression
was
that
of
great
excitement
and
there
was
a
peculiar
contraction
of
the
mouth
habitual
to
him
when
agitated
she
saw
him
even
to
each
minute
particular
of
his
dress
as
distinctly
as
she
had
ever
done
in
her
life
and
she
remembers
to
have
noticed
between
his
hands
the
white
of
his
unstained
however
with
blood
the
figure
seemed
to
bend
forward
as
if
in
pain
and
to
make
an
effort
to
speak
but
there
was
no
sound
it
remained
visible
the
wife
thinks
as
long
as
a
minute
and
then
disappeared
her
first
idea
was
to
ascertain
if
she
was
actually
awake
she
rubbed
her
eyes
with
the
sheet
and
felt
that
the
touch
was
real
her
little
nephew
was
in
bed
with
her
she
bent
over
the
sleeping
child
and
listened
to
its
breathing
the
sound
was
distinct
and
she
became
convinced
that
what
she
had
seen
was
no
dream
it
need
hardly
be
added
that
she
did
not
again
go
to
sleep
that
night
next
morning
she
related
all
this
to
her
mother
expressing
her
conviction
though
she
had
noticed
no
marks
of
blood
on
his
dress
that
captain
wheatcroft
was
either
killed
or
grievously
wounded
so
fully
impressed
was
she
with
the
reality
of
that
apparition
that
she
thenceforth
refused
all
invitations
a
young
friend
urged
her
soon
afterwards
to
go
with
her
to
a
fashionable
concert
reminding
her
that
she
had
received
from
malta
sent
by
her
husband
a
handsome
dress
cloak
which
she
had
never
yet
worn
but
she
positively
declined
declaring
that
uncertain
as
she
was
whether
she
was
not
already
a
widow
she
would
never
enter
a
place
of
amusement
until
she
had
letters
from
her
husband
if
indeed
he
still
lived
of
a
later
date
than
the
of
november
it
was
on
a
tuesday
in
the
month
of
december
that
the
telegram
regarding
the
actual
fate
of
captain
wheatcroft
was
published
in
london
it
was
to
the
effect
that
he
was
killed
before
lucknow
on
the
of
november
this
news
given
in
the
morning
paper
attracted
the
attention
of
mr
wilkinson
a
london
solicitor
who
had
in
charge
captain
affairs
when
at
a
later
period
this
gentleman
met
the
widow
she
informed
him
that
she
had
been
quite
prepared
for
the
melancholy
news
but
that
she
had
felt
sure
her
husband
could
not
have
been
killed
on
the
of
november
inasmuch
as
it
was
during
the
night
between
the
and
that
he
appeared
to
her
the
certificate
from
the
war
office
however
which
it
became
mr
wilkinson
duty
to
obtain
confirmed
the
date
given
in
the
telegram
its
tenor
being
as
follows
no
war
office
january
these
are
to
certify
that
it
appears
by
the
records
in
this
office
that
captain
german
wheatcroft
of
the
dragoon
guards
was
killed
in
action
on
the
of
november
b
hawes
the
difference
of
longitude
between
london
and
lucknow
being
about
five
hours
three
or
four
in
london
would
be
eight
or
nine
at
lucknow
but
it
was
in
the
not
in
the
as
will
be
seen
in
the
sequel
that
captain
wheatcroft
was
killed
had
he
fallen
on
the
therefore
the
apparition
to
his
wife
would
have
appeared
several
hours
before
the
engagement
in
which
he
fell
and
while
he
was
yet
alive

the
iron
cage
from
mrs
crowe
night
side
of
nature
as
you
express
a
wish
to
know
what
credit
is
to
be
attached
to
a
tale
sent
forth
after
a
lapse
of
between
thirty
and
forty
years
i
will
state
the
facts
as
they
were
recalled
last
year
by
a
daughter
of
sir
william
a
c
sir
james
my
mother
with
myself
and
my
brother
charles
went
abroad
towards
the
end
of
the
year
after
trying
several
different
places
we
determined
to
settle
at
lille
where
we
had
letters
of
introduction
to
several
of
the
best
french
families
there
sir
james
left
us
and
after
passing
a
few
days
in
an
uncomfortable
lodging
we
engaged
a
nice
large
family
house
which
we
liked
much
and
which
we
obtained
at
a
very
low
rent
even
for
that
part
of
the
world
about
three
weeks
after
we
were
established
there
i
walked
one
day
with
my
mother
to
the
bankers
for
the
purpose
of
delivering
our
letter
of
credit
from
sir
robert
herries
and
drawing
some
money
which
being
paid
in
heavy
pieces
we
found
we
could
not
carry
and
therefore
requested
the
banker
to
send
saying
we
live
in
the
place
du
lion
whereupon
he
looked
surprised
and
observed
that
he
knew
of
no
house
there
fit
for
us
except
indeed
he
added
the
one
that
has
been
long
uninhabited
on
account
of
the
that
walks
about
it
he
said
this
quite
seriously
and
in
a
natural
tone
of
voice
in
spite
of
which
we
laughed
and
were
quite
entertained
at
the
idea
of
a
ghost
but
at
the
same
time
we
begged
him
not
to
mention
the
thing
to
our
servants
lest
they
should
take
any
fancies
into
their
heads
and
my
mother
and
i
resolved
to
say
nothing
about
the
matter
to
anyone
i
suppose
it
is
the
ghost
said
my
mother
laughing
that
wakes
us
so
often
by
walking
over
our
heads
we
had
in
fact
been
awakened
several
nights
by
a
heavy
foot
which
we
supposed
to
be
that
of
one
of
the
of
whom
we
had
three
english
and
four
french
the
english
ones
men
and
women
every
one
of
them
returned
ultimately
to
england
with
us
a
night
or
two
afterwards
being
again
awakened
by
the
step
my
mother
asked
creswell
who
slept
in
the
room
above
us
no
one
my
lady
she
replied
it
is
a
large
empty
garret
about
a
week
or
ten
days
after
this
creswell
came
to
my
mother
one
morning
and
told
her
that
all
the
french
servants
talked
of
going
away
because
there
was
a
in
the
house
adding
that
there
seemed
to
be
a
strange
story
attached
to
the
place
which
was
said
together
with
some
other
property
to
have
belonged
to
a
young
man
whose
guardian
who
was
also
his
uncle
had
treated
him
cruelly
and
confined
him
in
an
iron
cage
and
as
he
had
subsequently
disappeared
it
was
conjectured
he
had
been
murdered
this
uncle
after
inheriting
the
property
had
suddenly
quitted
the
house
and
sold
it
to
the
father
of
the
man
of
whom
we
had
hired
it
since
that
period
though
it
had
been
several
times
let
nobody
had
ever
stayed
in
it
above
a
week
or
two
and
for
a
considerable
time
past
it
had
had
no
tenant
at
all
and
do
you
really
believe
all
this
nonsense
creswell
said
my
mother
well
i
do
know
my
lady
answered
she
but
there
is
the
iron
cage
in
the
garret
over
your
bedroom
where
you
may
see
it
if
you
please
of
course
we
rose
to
go
and
just
at
that
moment
an
old
officer
with
his
croix
de
st
louis
called
on
us
we
invited
him
to
accompany
us
and
we
ascended
together
we
found
as
creswell
had
said
a
large
empty
garret
with
bare
brick
walls
and
in
the
further
corner
of
it
stood
an
iron
cage
such
as
wild
beasts
are
kept
in
only
higher
it
was
about
four
feet
square
and
eight
in
height
and
there
was
an
iron
ring
in
the
wall
at
the
back
to
which
was
attached
an
old
rusty
chain
with
a
collar
fixed
to
the
end
of
it
i
confess
it
made
my
blood
creep
when
i
thought
of
the
possibility
of
any
human
being
having
inhabited
it
and
our
old
friend
expressed
as
much
horror
as
ourselves
assuring
us
that
it
must
certainly
have
been
constructed
for
some
such
dreadful
purpose
as
however
we
were
no
believer
in
ghosts
we
all
agreed
that
the
noises
must
proceed
from
somebody
who
had
an
interest
in
keeping
the
house
empty
and
since
it
was
very
disagreeable
to
imagine
that
there
were
secret
means
of
entering
it
by
night
we
resolved
as
soon
as
possible
to
look
out
for
another
residence
and
in
the
meantime
to
say
nothing
about
the
matter
to
anybody
about
ten
days
after
this
determination
my
mother
observing
one
morning
that
creswell
when
she
came
to
dress
her
looked
exceedingly
pale
and
ill
inquired
if
anything
was
the
matter
with
her
indeed
my
lady
answered
she
we
have
been
frightened
to
death
and
neither
i
nor
mrs
marsh
can
sleep
again
in
the
room
we
are
now
in
well
returned
my
mother
you
shall
both
come
and
sleep
in
the
little
spare
room
next
us
but
what
has
alarmed
you
someone
my
lady
went
through
our
room
in
the
night
we
both
saw
the
figure
but
we
covered
our
heads
with
the
and
lay
in
a
dreadful
fright
till
morning
on
hearing
this
i
could
not
help
laughing
upon
which
creswell
burst
into
tears
and
seeing
how
nervous
she
was
we
comforted
her
by
saying
we
had
heard
of
a
good
house
and
that
we
should
very
soon
abandon
our
present
habitation
a
few
nights
afterwards
my
mother
requested
me
and
charles
to
go
into
her
bedroom
and
fetch
her
frame
that
she
might
prepare
her
work
for
the
next
day
it
was
after
supper
and
we
were
ascending
the
stairs
by
the
light
of
a
lamp
which
was
always
kept
burning
when
we
saw
going
up
before
us
a
tall
thin
figure
with
hair
flowing
down
his
back
and
wearing
a
loose
powdering
gown
we
both
at
once
concluded
it
was
my
sister
hannah
and
called
out
it
wo
do
hannah
you
can
not
frighten
us
upon
which
the
figure
turned
into
a
recess
in
the
wall
but
as
there
was
nobody
there
when
we
passed
we
concluded
that
hannah
had
contrived
somehow
or
other
to
slip
away
and
make
her
escape
by
the
back
stairs
on
telling
this
to
my
mother
however
she
said
it
is
very
odd
for
hannah
went
to
bed
with
a
headache
before
you
came
in
from
your
walk
and
sure
enough
on
going
to
her
room
there
we
found
her
fast
asleep
and
alice
who
was
at
work
there
assured
us
that
she
had
been
so
for
more
than
an
hour
on
mentioning
this
circumstance
to
creswell
she
turned
quite
pale
and
exclaimed
that
that
was
precisely
the
figure
she
and
marsh
had
seen
in
their
bedroom
about
this
time
my
brother
harry
came
to
spend
a
few
days
with
us
and
we
gave
him
a
room
up
another
pair
of
stairs
at
the
opposite
end
of
the
house
a
morning
or
two
after
his
arrival
when
he
came
down
to
breakfast
he
asked
my
mother
angrily
whether
she
thought
he
went
to
bed
drunk
and
could
not
put
out
his
own
candle
that
she
sent
those
french
rascals
to
watch
him
my
mother
assured
him
that
she
had
never
thought
of
doing
such
a
thing
but
he
persisted
in
the
accusation
adding
last
night
i
jumped
up
and
opened
the
door
and
by
the
light
of
the
moon
through
the
skylight
i
saw
the
fellow
in
his
loose
gown
at
the
bottom
of
the
stairs
if
i
had
not
been
in
my
shirt
i
would
have
gone
after
him
and
made
him
remember
coming
to
watch
me
we
were
now
preparing
to
quit
the
house
having
secured
another
belonging
to
a
gentleman
who
was
going
to
spend
some
time
in
italy
but
a
few
days
before
our
removal
it
happened
that
a
mr
and
mrs
atkyns
some
english
friends
of
ours
called
to
whom
we
mentioned
these
strange
circumstances
observing
how
extremely
unpleasant
it
was
to
live
in
a
house
that
somebody
found
means
of
getting
into
though
how
they
contrived
it
we
could
not
discover
nor
what
their
motive
could
be
except
it
was
to
frighten
us
observing
that
nobody
could
sleep
in
the
room
marsh
and
creswell
had
been
obliged
to
give
up
upon
this
mrs
atkyns
laughed
heartily
and
said
that
she
should
like
of
all
things
to
sleep
there
if
my
mother
would
allow
her
adding
that
with
her
little
terrier
she
should
not
be
afraid
of
any
ghost
that
ever
appeared
as
my
mother
had
of
course
no
objection
to
this
fancy
of
hers
mrs
atkyns
requested
her
husband
to
ride
home
with
the
groom
in
order
that
the
latter
might
bring
her
before
the
gates
of
the
town
were
shut
as
they
were
then
residing
a
little
way
in
the
country
mr
atkyns
smiled
and
said
she
was
very
bold
but
he
made
no
difficulties
and
sent
the
things
and
his
wife
retired
with
her
dog
to
her
room
when
we
retired
to
ours
apparently
without
the
least
apprehension
when
she
came
down
in
the
morning
we
were
immediately
struck
at
seeing
her
look
very
ill
and
on
inquiring
if
she
too
had
been
frightened
she
said
she
had
been
awakened
in
the
night
by
something
moving
in
her
room
and
that
by
the
light
of
the
night
lamp
she
saw
most
distinctly
a
figure
and
that
the
dog
which
was
very
spirited
and
flew
at
everything
never
stirred
although
she
endeavoured
to
make
him
we
saw
clearly
that
she
had
been
very
much
alarmed
and
when
mr
atkyns
came
and
endeavoured
to
dissipate
the
feeling
by
persuading
her
that
she
might
have
dreamt
it
she
got
quite
angry
we
could
not
help
thinking
that
she
had
actually
seen
something
and
my
mother
said
after
she
was
gone
that
though
she
could
not
bring
herself
to
believe
it
was
really
a
ghost
still
she
earnestly
hoped
that
she
might
get
out
of
the
house
without
seeing
this
figure
which
frightened
people
so
much
we
were
now
within
three
days
of
the
one
fixed
for
our
removal
i
had
been
taking
a
long
ride
and
being
tired
had
fallen
asleep
the
moment
i
lay
down
but
in
the
middle
of
the
night
i
was
suddenly
awakened
i
can
not
tell
by
what
for
the
step
over
our
heads
we
had
become
so
used
to
that
it
no
longer
disturbed
us
well
i
awoke
i
had
been
lying
with
my
face
towards
my
mother
who
was
asleep
beside
me
and
as
one
usually
does
on
awaking
i
turned
to
the
other
side
where
the
weather
being
warm
the
curtain
of
the
bed
was
undrawn
as
it
was
also
at
the
foot
and
i
saw
standing
by
a
chest
of
drawers
which
were
betwixt
me
and
the
window
a
thin
tall
figure
in
a
loose
powdering
gown
one
arm
resting
on
the
drawers
and
the
face
turned
towards
me
i
saw
it
quite
distinctly
by
the
which
burnt
clearly
it
was
a
long
thin
pale
young
face
with
oh
such
a
melancholy
expression
as
can
never
be
effaced
from
my
memory
i
was
certainly
very
much
frightened
but
my
great
horror
was
lest
my
mother
should
awake
and
see
the
figure
i
turned
my
head
gently
towards
her
and
heard
her
breathing
high
in
a
sound
sleep
just
then
the
clock
on
the
stairs
struck
four
i
daresay
it
was
nearly
an
hour
before
i
ventured
to
look
again
and
when
i
did
take
courage
to
turn
my
eyes
towards
the
drawers
there
was
nothing
yet
i
had
not
heard
the
slightest
sound
though
i
had
been
listening
with
the
greatest
intensity
as
you
may
suppose
i
never
closed
my
eyes
again
and
glad
i
was
when
creswell
knocked
at
the
door
as
she
did
every
morning
for
we
always
locked
it
and
it
was
my
business
to
get
out
of
bed
and
let
her
in
but
on
this
occasion
instead
of
doing
so
i
called
out
come
in
the
door
is
not
fastened
upon
which
she
answered
that
it
was
and
i
was
obliged
to
get
out
of
bed
and
admit
her
as
usual
when
i
told
my
mother
what
had
happened
she
was
very
grateful
to
me
for
not
waking
her
and
commended
me
much
for
my
resolution
but
as
she
was
always
my
first
object
that
was
not
to
be
wondered
at
she
however
resolved
not
to
risk
another
night
in
the
house
and
we
got
out
of
it
that
very
day
after
instituting
with
the
aid
of
the
servants
a
thorough
search
with
a
view
to
ascertain
whether
there
was
any
possible
means
of
getting
into
the
rooms
except
by
the
usual
modes
of
ingress
but
our
search
was
vain
none
could
be
discovered
considering
the
number
of
people
that
were
in
the
house
the
fearlessness
of
the
family
and
their
disinclination
to
believe
in
what
is
called
the
together
with
the
great
interest
the
owner
of
this
large
and
handsome
house
must
have
had
in
discovering
the
trick
if
there
had
been
one
i
think
it
is
difficult
to
find
any
other
explanation
of
this
strange
story
than
that
the
sad
and
disappointed
spirit
of
this
poor
injured
and
probably
murdered
boy
had
never
been
disengaged
from
its
earthly
relations
to
which
regret
for
its
frustrated
hopes
and
violated
rights
still
held
it
attached
xxxi
the
ghost
of
rosewarne
from
hunt
romances
of
the
west
of
england
ezekiel
grosse
bought
the
lands
of
rosewarne
from
one
of
the
de
rosewarnes
who
had
become
involved
in
debt
by
endeavouring
without
sufficient
means
to
support
the
dignity
of
his
family
there
is
reason
for
believing
that
ezekiel
was
the
legal
adviser
of
this
unfortunate
rosewarne
and
that
he
was
not
in
his
transactions
with
his
client
however
this
may
be
ezekiel
grosse
had
scarcely
made
rosewarne
his
before
he
was
alarmed
by
noises
at
first
of
an
unearthly
character
and
subsequently
one
very
dark
night
by
the
appearance
of
the
ghost
himself
in
the
form
of
a
worn
and
aged
man
the
first
appearance
was
in
the
park
but
he
subsequently
repeated
his
visits
in
the
house
but
always
after
dark
ezekiel
grosse
was
not
a
man
to
be
terrified
at
trifles
and
for
some
time
he
paid
but
slight
attention
to
his
nocturnal
visitor
howbeit
the
repetition
of
visits
and
certain
mysterious
indications
on
the
part
of
the
ghost
became
annoying
to
ezekiel
one
night
when
seated
in
his
office
examining
some
deeds
and
being
rather
irritable
having
lost
an
important
suit
his
visitor
approached
him
making
some
strange
indications
which
the
lawyer
could
not
understand
ezekiel
suddenly
exclaimed
in
the
name
of
god
what
wantest
thou
to
show
thee
ezekiel
grosse
where
the
gold
for
which
thou
longest
lies
buried
no
one
ever
lived
upon
whom
the
greed
of
gold
was
stronger
than
on
ezekiel
yet
he
hesitated
now
that
his
spectral
friend
had
spoken
so
plainly
and
trembled
in
every
limb
as
the
ghost
slowly
delivered
himself
in
sepulchral
tones
of
this
telling
speech
the
lawyer
looked
fixedly
on
the
spectre
but
he
dared
not
utter
a
word
he
longed
to
obtain
possession
of
the
secret
yet
he
feared
to
ask
him
where
he
was
to
find
this
treasure
the
spectre
looked
as
fixedly
at
the
poor
trembling
lawyer
as
if
enjoying
the
sight
of
his
terror
at
length
lifting
his
finger
he
beckoned
ezekiel
to
follow
him
turning
at
the
same
time
to
leave
the
room
ezekiel
was
glued
to
his
seat
he
could
not
exert
strength
enough
to
move
although
he
desired
to
do
so
come
said
the
ghost
in
a
hollow
voice
the
lawyer
was
powerless
to
come
gold
exclaimed
the
old
man
in
a
whining
tone
though
in
a
louder
key
where
gasped
ezekiel
follow
me
and
i
will
show
thee
said
the
ghost
ezekiel
endeavoured
to
rise
but
it
was
in
vain
i
command
thee
come
almost
shrieked
the
ghost
ezekiel
felt
that
he
was
compelled
to
follow
his
friend
and
by
some
supernatural
power
rather
than
his
own
he
followed
the
spectre
out
of
the
room
and
through
the
hall
into
the
park
they
passed
onward
through
the
night
the
ghost
gliding
before
the
lawyer
and
guiding
him
by
a
peculiar
phosphorescent
light
which
appeared
to
glow
from
every
part
of
the
form
until
they
arrived
at
a
little
dell
and
had
reached
a
small
cairn
formed
of
granite
boulders
by
this
the
spectre
rested
and
when
ezekiel
had
approached
it
and
was
standing
on
the
other
side
of
the
cairn
still
trembling
the
aged
man
looking
fixedly
in
his
face
said
in
low
tones
ezekiel
grosse
thou
longest
for
gold
as
i
did
i
won
the
glittering
prize
but
i
could
not
enjoy
it
heaps
of
treasure
are
buried
beneath
those
stones
it
is
thine
if
thou
diggest
for
it
win
the
gold
ezekiel
glitter
with
the
wicked
ones
of
the
world
and
when
thou
art
the
most
joyous
i
will
look
in
upon
thy
happiness
the
ghost
then
disappeared
and
as
soon
as
grosse
could
recover
himself
from
the
extreme
trepidation
the
result
of
mixed
feelings
he
looked
about
him
and
finding
himself
alone
he
exclaimed
ghost
or
devil
i
will
soon
prove
whether
or
not
thou
liest
ezekiel
is
said
to
have
heard
a
laugh
echoing
between
the
hills
as
he
said
those
words
the
lawyer
noted
well
the
spot
returned
to
his
house
pondered
on
all
the
circumstances
of
his
case
and
eventually
resolved
to
seize
the
earliest
opportunity
when
he
might
do
so
unobserved
of
removing
the
stones
and
examining
the
ground
beneath
them
a
few
nights
after
this
ezekiel
went
to
the
little
cairn
and
by
the
aid
of
a
crowbar
he
soon
overturned
the
stones
and
laid
the
ground
bare
he
then
commenced
digging
and
had
not
proceeded
far
when
his
spade
struck
against
some
other
metal
he
carefully
cleared
away
the
earth
and
he
then
felt
for
he
could
not
see
having
no
light
with
him
that
he
had
uncovered
a
metallic
urn
of
some
kind
he
found
it
quite
impossible
to
lift
it
and
he
was
therefore
compelled
to
cover
it
up
again
and
to
replace
the
stones
sufficiently
to
hide
it
from
the
observation
of
any
chance
wanderer
the
next
night
ezekiel
found
that
this
urn
which
was
of
bronze
contained
gold
coins
of
a
very
ancient
date
he
loaded
himself
with
his
treasure
and
returned
home
from
time
to
time
at
night
as
ezekiel
found
he
could
do
so
without
exciting
the
suspicions
of
his
servants
he
visited
the
urn
and
thus
by
degrees
removed
all
the
treasure
to
rosewarne
house
there
was
nothing
in
the
series
of
circumstances
which
had
surrounded
ezekiel
which
he
could
less
understand
than
the
fact
that
the
ghost
of
the
old
man
had
left
off
troubling
him
from
the
moment
when
he
had
disclosed
to
him
the
of
this
treasure
the
neighbouring
gentry
could
not
but
observe
the
rapid
improvements
which
ezekiel
grosse
made
in
his
mansion
his
grounds
in
his
personal
appearance
and
indeed
in
everything
by
which
he
was
surrounded
in
a
short
time
he
abandoned
the
law
and
led
in
every
respect
the
life
of
a
country
gentleman
he
ostentatiously
paraded
his
power
to
procure
all
earthly
enjoyments
and
in
spite
of
his
notoriously
bad
character
he
succeeded
in
drawing
many
of
the
landed
proprietors
around
him
things
went
well
with
ezekiel
the
man
who
could
in
those
days
visit
london
in
his
own
carriage
and
four
was
not
without
a
large
circle
of
flatterers
the
lawyer
who
had
struggled
hard
in
the
outset
of
life
to
secure
wealth
and
who
did
not
always
employ
the
most
honest
means
for
doing
so
now
found
himself
the
centre
of
a
circle
to
whom
he
could
preach
honesty
and
receive
from
them
expressions
of
the
admiration
in
which
the
world
holds
the
possessor
of
gold
his
old
tricks
were
forgotten
and
he
was
put
in
places
of
honour
this
state
of
things
continued
for
some
time
indeed
grosse
entertainments
became
more
and
more
splendid
and
his
revels
more
and
more
seductive
to
those
he
admitted
to
share
them
with
him
the
lord
of
rosewarne
was
the
lord
of
the
west
to
him
everyone
bowed
the
knee
he
walked
the
earth
as
the
proud
possessor
of
a
large
share
of
the
planet
it
was
christmas
eve
and
a
large
gathering
there
was
at
rosewarne
in
the
hall
the
ladies
and
gentlemen
were
in
the
full
enjoyment
of
the
dance
and
in
the
kitchen
all
the
tenantry
and
the
servants
were
emulating
their
superiors
everything
went
joyously
but
when
the
mirth
was
in
full
swing
and
ezekiel
felt
to
the
full
the
influence
of
wealth
it
appeared
as
if
all
in
a
moment
the
chill
of
death
had
fallen
over
everyone
the
dancers
paused
and
looked
one
at
another
each
one
struck
with
the
other
paleness
and
there
in
the
middle
of
the
hall
everyone
saw
a
strange
old
man
looking
angrily
but
in
silence
at
ezekiel
grosse
who
was
fixed
in
terror
blank
as
a
statue
no
one
had
seen
this
old
man
enter
the
hall
yet
there
he
was
in
the
midst
of
them
it
was
but
for
a
minute
and
he
was
gone
ezekiel
as
if
a
frozen
torrent
of
water
had
thawed
in
an
instant
recovered
himself
and
roared
at
them
what
do
you
think
of
that
for
a
christmas
play
ha
ha
ha
how
frightened
you
all
look
butler
hand
round
the
spiced
wines
on
with
the
dancing
my
friends
it
was
only
a
trick
ay
and
a
clever
one
which
i
have
put
upon
you
on
with
your
dancing
my
friends
but
with
all
his
boisterous
attempts
to
restore
the
spirit
of
the
evening
ezekiel
could
not
succeed
there
was
an
influence
stronger
than
any
he
could
command
and
one
by
one
framing
sundry
excuses
his
guests
took
their
departure
every
one
of
them
satisfied
that
all
was
not
right
at
rosewarne
from
that
christmas
eve
grosse
was
a
changed
man
he
tried
to
be
his
former
self
but
it
was
in
vain
again
and
again
he
called
his
gay
companions
around
him
but
at
every
feast
there
appeared
one
more
than
was
desired
an
aged
man
weird
beyond
measure
took
his
place
at
the
table
in
the
middle
of
the
feast
and
although
he
spoke
not
he
exerted
a
miraculous
power
over
all
no
one
dared
to
move
no
one
ventured
to
speak
occasionally
ezekiel
assumed
an
appearance
of
courage
which
he
felt
not
rallied
his
guests
and
made
sundry
excuses
for
the
presence
of
his
aged
friend
whom
he
represented
as
having
a
mental
infirmity
as
being
deaf
and
dumb
on
all
such
occasions
the
old
man
rose
from
the
table
and
looking
at
the
host
laughed
a
demoniac
laugh
of
joy
and
departed
as
quietly
as
he
came
the
natural
consequence
of
this
was
that
ezekiel
grosse
friends
fell
away
from
him
and
he
became
a
lonely
man
amidst
his
vast
possessions
his
only
companion
being
his
faithful
clerk
john
call
the
persecuting
presence
of
the
spectre
became
more
and
more
constant
and
wherever
the
poor
lawyer
went
there
was
the
aged
man
at
his
side
from
being
one
of
the
finest
men
in
the
county
he
became
a
miserably
attenuated
and
bowed
old
man
misery
was
stamped
on
every
feature
terror
was
indicated
in
every
movement
at
length
he
appears
to
have
besought
his
ghostly
attendant
to
free
him
of
his
presence
it
was
long
before
the
ghost
would
listen
to
any
terms
but
when
ezekiel
at
length
agreed
to
surrender
the
whole
of
his
wealth
to
anyone
whom
the
spectre
might
indicate
he
obtained
a
promise
that
upon
this
being
carried
out
in
a
perfectly
legal
manner
in
favour
of
john
call
that
he
should
no
longer
be
haunted
this
was
after
numerous
struggles
on
the
part
of
ezekiel
to
retain
his
property
or
at
least
some
portion
of
it
legally
settled
and
john
call
became
possessor
of
rosewarne
and
the
adjoining
lands
grosse
was
then
informed
that
this
evil
spirit
was
one
of
the
ancestors
of
the
rosewarne
from
whom
by
his
fraudulent
dealings
he
obtained
the
place
and
that
he
was
allowed
to
visit
the
earth
again
for
the
purpose
of
inflicting
the
most
condign
punishment
on
the
avaricious
lawyer
his
avarice
had
been
gratified
his
pride
had
been
pampered
to
the
highest
and
then
he
was
made
a
pitiful
spectacle
at
whom
all
men
pointed
and
no
one
pitied
he
lived
on
in
misery
but
it
was
for
a
short
time
he
was
found
dead
and
the
country
people
ever
said
that
his
death
was
a
violent
one
they
spoke
of
marks
on
his
body
and
some
even
asserted
that
the
spectre
of
de
rosewarne
was
seen
rejoicing
amidst
a
crowd
of
devils

the
rest

he
had
the
reputation
of
a
worthy
good
man

was
commonly
taken
notice
of
for
an
habitual
saying
by
way
of
interjection
almost
to
anything
viz

mr

fell
sick
at
his
house
at

in

year
and
dr

sent
for
to
him
who
after
some
time
gave
the

he
had
not

spoken
in

on

to
the
horror
and
amazement
of
dr

the
great
iron
chest
by
the
window
at
his
with
three
locks
to
it
in
which
were
all
the
writings
and
evidences
of
the
said
mr

estate
began
to
open
first
one
lock
and
then
another
then
the
third
afterwards
the
lid
of
the

lifted
up
of
itself
and
stood
wide
open

the
patient
mr

who
had
not

in

lifted
himself
up
also
and
looking
upon
the
chest
cry

you
are
in

i
be

so
the

lay
down
and

no

then
the
chest
fell
again

itself
and
lock

one
lock
after

as
the

opened

they
tried
to
knock
it
open

mr

from

of

in
a
letter
to
the
said
doctor
he
gives
this
account
i
am
said
he
very
confident
of
the
truth
of
the
story
for
i
had
it
from
a
very
good
lady
the
eldest
daughter
of
the
said
john
mallet
whose
trustee
mr
bourne
was
and
only
aunt
to
the
countess
of
rochester
who
knew
all
the
parties
and
i
have
heard
dr
raymond
and
mr
carlisle
relate
it
often
with
amazement
being
both
persons
of
credit
the
curious
may
be
inquisitive
what
the
meaning
of
the
opening
of
the
chest
may
be
and
of
mr
bourne
his
saying
say

i
be
with
you
by
and
as
for
the
former
it
is
noted
by
paracelsus
especially
and
by
others
that
there
are
signs
often
given
of
the
departure
of
sick
men
lying
on
their
death
beds
of
which
this
opening
of
the
iron
coffer
or
chest
and
closing
again
is
more
than
ordinary
significant
especially
if
we
recall
to

that

more

the
sick
man
death
as
for
the
latter
it
seems
to
be
nothing
else
but
the
saying
to
the
presage
uttered
in
his
accustomary
form
of
speech

the
strange
case
of
bezuel
from
christmas
phantom
world
in
said
bezuel
being
a
schoolboy
of
about
fifteen
years
of
age
i
became
acquainted
with
the
two
children
of
abaquene
attorney
schoolboys
like
myself
the
eldest
was
of
my
own
age
the
second
was
eighteen
months
younger
he
was
named
desfontaines
we
took
all
our
walks
and
all
our
parties
of
pleasure
together
and
whether
it
was
that
desfontaines
had
more
affection
for
me
or
that
he
was
more
gay
obliging
and
clever
than
his
brother
i
loved
him
the
best
in
we
were
walking
both
of
us
in
the
cloister
of
the
capuchins
he
told
me
that
he
had
lately
read
a
story
of
two
friends
who
had
promised
each
other
that
the
first
of
them
who
died
should
come
and
bring
news
of
his
condition
to
the
one
still
living
that
the
one
who
died
came
back
to
earth
and
told
his
friend
surprising
things
upon
that
desfontaines
told
me
that
he
had
a
favour
to
ask
me
that
he
begged
me
to
grant
it
instantly
it
was
to
make
him
a
similar
promise
and
on
his
part
he
would
do
the
same
i
told
him
that
i
would
not
for
several
months
he
talked
to
me
of
it
often
and
seriously
i
always
resisted
his
wish
at
last
towards
the
month
of
august
as
he
was
to
leave
to
go
and
study
at
caen
he
pressed
me
so
much
with
tears
in
his
eyes
that
i
consented
to
it
he
drew
out
at
that
moment
two
little
papers
which
he
had
ready
written
one
was
signed
with
his
blood
in
which
he
promised
me
that
in
case
of
his
death
he
would
come
and
bring
me
news
of
his
condition
in
the
other
i
promised
him
the
same
thing
i
pricked
my
finger
a
drop
of
blood
came
with
which
i
signed
my
name
he
was
delighted
to
have
my
billet
and
embracing
me
thanked
me
a
thousand
times
some
time
after
he
set
off
with
his
tutor
our
separation
caused
us
much
grief
but
we
wrote
to
each
other
now
and
then
and
it
was
but
six
weeks
since
i
had
had
a
letter
from
him
when
what
i
am
going
to
relate
to
you
happened
to
me
the
of
july
one
thursday
i
shall
remember
it
all
my
life
the
late
sorteville
with
whom
i
lodged
and
who
had
been
very
kind
to
me
begged
of
me
to
go
to
a
meadow
near
the
cordeliers
and
help
his
people
who
were
making
hay
and
to
make
haste
i
had
not
been
there
a
quarter
of
an
hour
when
about
two
i
all
of
a
sudden
felt
giddy
and
weak
in
vain
i
lent
upon
my
i
was
obliged
to
place
myself
on
a
little
hay
where
i
was
nearly
half
an
hour
recovering
my
senses
that
passed
off
but
as
nothing
of
the
kind
had
ever
occurred
to
me
before
i
was
surprised
at
it
and
i
feared
it
might
be
the
commencement
of
an
illness
nevertheless
it
did
not
make
much
impression
upon
me
during
the
remainder
of
the
day
it
is
true
i
did
not
sleep
that
night
so
well
as
usual
the
next
day
at
the
same
hour
as
i
was
conducting
to
the
meadow
de
st
simon
the
grandson
of
de
sorteville
who
was
then
ten
years
old
i
felt
myself
seized
on
the
way
with
a
similar
faintness
and
i
sat
down
on
a
stone
in
the
shade
that
passed
off
and
we
continued
our
way
nothing
more
happened
to
me
that
day
and
at
night
i
had
hardly
any
sleep
at
last
on
the
morrow
the
second
day
of
august
being
in
the
loft
where
they
laid
up
the
hay
they
brought
from
the
meadow
i
was
taken
with
a
similar
giddiness
and
a
similar
faintness
but
still
more
violent
than
the
other
i
fainted
away
completely
one
of
the
men
perceived
it
i
have
been
told
that
i
was
asked
what
was
the
matter
with
me
and
that
i
replied
have
seen
what
i
never
should
have
believed
but
i
have
no
recollection
of
either
the
question
or
the
answer
that
however
accords
with
what
i
do
remember
to
have
seen
just
then
as
it
were
someone
naked
to
the
middle
but
whom
however
i
did
not
recognise
they
helped
me
down
from
the
ladder
the
faintness
seized
me
again
my
head
swam
as
i
was
between
two
rounds
of
the
ladder
and
again
i
fainted
they
took
me
down
and
placed
me
on
a
beam
which
served
for
a
seat
in
the
large
square
of
the
capuchins
i
sat
down
on
it
and
then
i
no
longer
saw
de
sorteville
nor
his
domestics
although
present
but
perceiving
desfontaines
near
the
foot
of
the
ladder
who
made
me
a
sign
to
come
to
him
i
moved
on
my
seat
as
if
to
make
room
for
him
and
those
who
saw
me
and
whom
i
did
not
see
although
my
eyes
were
open
remarked
this
movement
as
he
did
not
come
i
rose
to
go
to
him
he
advanced
towards
me
took
my
left
arm
with
his
right
arm
and
led
me
about
thirty
paces
from
thence
into
a
retired
street
holding
me
still
under
the
arm
the
domestics
supposing
that
my
giddiness
had
passed
off
and
that
i
had
purposely
retired
went
everyone
to
their
work
except
a
little
servant
who
went
and
told
de
sorteville
that
i
was
talking
all
alone
de
sorteville
thought
i
was
tipsy
he
drew
near
and
heard
me
ask
some
questions
and
make
some
answers
which
he
has
told
me
since
i
was
there
nearly
of
an
hour
conversing
with
desfontaines
promised
you
said
he
to
me
if
i
died
before
you
i
would
come
and
tell
you
of
it
i
was
drowned
the
day
before
yesterday
in
the
river
of
caen
at
nearly
this
same
hour
i
was
out
walking
with
such
and
such
a
one
it
was
very
warm
and
we
had
a
wish
to
bathe
a
faintness
seized
me
in
the
water
and
i
fell
to
the
bottom
the
abbé
de
my
comrade
dived
to
bring
me
up
i
seized
hold
of
his
foot
but
whether
he
was
afraid
it
might
be
a
salmon
because
i
held
him
so
fast
or
that
he
wished
to
remount
promptly
to
the
surface
of
the
water
he
shook
his
legs
so
roughly
that
he
gave
me
a
violent
kick
on
the
breast
which
sent
me
to
the
bottom
of
the
river
which
is
there
very
deep
desfontaines
related
to
me
afterwards
all
that
had
occurred
to
them
in
their
walk
and
the
subjects
they
had
conversed
upon
it
was
in
vain
for
me
to
ask
him
questions
whether
he
was
saved
whether
he
was
damned
if
he
was
in
purgatory
if
i
was
in
a
state
of
grace
and
if
i
should
soon
follow
him
he
continued
to
discourse
as
if
he
had
not
heard
me
and
as
if
he
would
not
hear
me
i
approached
him
several
times
to
embrace
him
but
it
seemed
to
me
that
i
embraced
nothing
and
yet
i
felt
very
sensibly
that
he
held
me
tightly
by
the
arm
and
that
when
i
tried
to
turn
away
my
head
that
i
might
not
see
him
because
i
could
not
look
at
him
without
feeling
afflicted
he
shook
my
arm
as
if
to
oblige
me
to
look
at
and
listen
to
him
he
always
appeared
to
me
taller
than
i
had
seen
him
and
taller
even
than
he
was
at
the
time
of
his
death
although
he
had
grown
during
the
eighteen
months
in
which
we
had
not
met
i
beheld
him
always
naked
to
the
middle
of
his
body
his
head
uncovered
with
his
fine
hair
and
a
white
scroll
twisted
in
his
hair
over
his
forehead
on
which
there
was
some
writing
but
i
could
only
make
out
the
word
it
was
his
usual
tone
of
voice
he
appeared
to
me
neither
gay
nor
sad
but
in
a
calm
and
tranquil
state
he
begged
of
me
when
his
brother
returned
to
tell
him
certain
things
to
say
to
his
father
and
mother
he
begged
me
to
say
the
seven
psalms
which
had
been
given
him
as
a
penance
the
preceding
sunday
which
he
had
not
yet
recited
again
he
recommended
me
to
speak
to
his
brother
and
then
he
bade
me
adieu
saying
as
he
left
me
which
was
the
usual
term
he
made
use
of
when
at
the
end
of
our
walk
we
bade
each
other
to
go
home
he
told
me
that
at
the
time
he
was
drowned
his
brother
who
was
writing
a
translation
regretted
having
let
him
go
without
accompanying
him
fearing
some
accident
he
described
to
me
so
well
where
he
was
drowned
and
the
tree
in
the
avenue
of
louvigni
on
which
he
had
written
a
few
words
that
two
years
afterwards
being
there
with
the
late
chevalier
de
getel
one
of
these
who
were
with
him
at
the
time
he
was
drowned
i
pointed
out
to
him
the
very
spot
and
by
counting
the
trees
in
a
particular
direction
which
desfontaines
had
specified
to
me
i
went
straight
up
to
the
tree
and
i
found
his
writing
he
the
chevalier
told
me
also
that
the
article
of
the
seven
psalms
was
true
and
that
on
coming
from
confession
that
they
had
told
each
other
their
penance
and
since
then
his
brother
has
told
me
that
it
was
quite
true
that
at
that
hour
he
was
writing
his
exercise
and
he
reproached
himself
for
not
having
accompanied
his
brother
as
nearly
a
month
passed
by
without
my
being
able
to
do
what
desfontaines
had
told
me
in
regard
to
his
brother
he
appeared
to
me
again
twice
before
dinner
at
a
country
house
whither
i
had
gone
to
dine
a
league
from
hence
i
was
very
faint
i
told
them
not
to
mind
me
that
it
was
nothing
and
that
i
should
soon
recover
myself
and
i
went
to
a
corner
of
the
garden
desfontaines
having
appeared
to
me
reproached
me
for
not
having
yet
spoken
to
his
brother
and
again
conversed
with
me
for
a
quarter
of
an
hour
without
answering
any
of
my
questions
as
i
was
going
in
the
morning
to
de
la
victoire
he
appeared
to
me
again
but
for
a
shorter
time
and
pressed
me
always
to
speak
to
his
brother
and
left
me
saying
still
without
choosing
to
reply
to
my
questions
it
is
a
remarkable
thing
that
i
always
felt
a
pain
in
that
part
of
my
arm
which
he
had
held
me
by
the
first
time
until
i
had
spoken
to
his
brother
i
was
three
days
without
being
able
to
sleep
from
the
astonishment
and
agitation
i
felt
at
the
end
of
the
first
conversation
i
told
de
varonville
my
neighbour
and
schoolfellow
that
desfontaines
had
been
drowned
that
he
himself
had
just
appeared
to
me
and
told
me
so
he
went
away
and
ran
to
the
parents
house
to
know
if
it
was
true
they
had
just
received
the
news
but
by
a
mistake
he
understood
that
it
was
the
eldest
he
assured
me
that
he
had
read
the
letter
of
desfontaines
and
he
believed
it
but
i
maintained
always
that
it
could
not
be
and
that
desfontaines
himself
had
appeared
to
me
he
returned
came
back
and
told
me
in
tears
that
it
was
but
too
true
xxxiv
the
marquis
de
rambouillet
the
phantom
world
the
marquis
de
rambouillet
eldest
brother
of
the
duchess
of
montauzier
and
the
marquis
de
precy
eldest
son
of
the
family
of
nantouillet
both
of
them
between
twenty
and
thirty
were
intimate
friends
and
went
to
the
wars
as
in
france
do
all
men
of
quality
as
they
were
conversing
one
day
together
on
the
subject
of
the
other
world
they
promised
each
other
that
the
first
who
died
should
come
and
bring
the
news
to
his
companion
at
the
end
of
three
months
the
marquis
de
rambouillet
set
off
for
flanders
where
the
war
was
then
being
carried
on
and
de
precy
detained
by
a
high
fever
remained
at
paris
six
weeks
afterwards
de
precy
at
six
in
the
morning
heard
the
curtains
of
his
bed
drawn
and
turning
to
see
who
it
was
he
perceived
the
marquis
de
rambouillet
in
his
buff
vest
and
boots
he
sprung
out
of
bed
to
embrace
him
to
show
his
joy
at
his
return
but
rambouillet
retreating
a
few
steps
told
him
that
these
caresses
were
no
longer
seasonable
for
he
only
came
to
keep
his
word
with
him
that
he
had
been
killed
the
day
before
on
such
an
occasion
that
all
that
was
said
of
the
other
world
was
certainly
true
that
he
must
think
of
leading
a
different
life
and
that
he
had
no
time
to
lose
as
he
would
be
killed
the
first
action
he
was
engaged
in
it
is
impossible
to
express
the
surprise
of
the
marquis
de
precy
at
this
discourse
as
he
could
not
believe
what
he
heard
he
made
several
efforts
to
embrace
his
friend
whom
he
thought
desirous
of
deceiving
him
but
he
embraced
only
air
and
rambouillet
seeing
that
he
was
incredulous
showed
the
wound
he
had
received
which
was
in
the
side
whence
the
blood
still
appeared
to
flow
after
that
the
phantom
disappeared
and
left
de
precy
in
a
state
of
alarm
more
easy
to
comprehend
than
describe
he
called
at
the
same
time
his
de
and
awakened
all
the
family
with
his
cries
several
persons
ran
to
his
room
and
he
related
to
them
what
he
had
just
seen
everyone
attributed
this
vision
to
the
violence
of
the
fever
which
might
have
deranged
his
imagination
they
begged
of
him
to
go
to
bed
again
assuring
him
that
he
must
have
dreamt
what
he
told
them
the
marquis
in
despair
on
seeing
that
they
took
him
for
a
visionary
related
all
the
circumstances
i
have
just
recounted
but
it
was
in
vain
for
him
to
protest
that
he
had
seen
and
heard
his
friend
being
wideawake
they
persisted
in
the
same
idea
until
the
arrival
of
the
post
from
flanders
which
brought
the
news
of
the
death
of
the
marquis
de
rambouillet
this
first
circumstance
being
found
true
and
in
the
same
manner
as
de
precy
had
said
those
to
whom
he
had
related
the
adventure
began
to
think
that
there
might
be
something
in
it
because
rambouillet
having
been
killed
precisely
on
the
eve
of
the
day
he
had
said
it
it
was
impossible
de
precy
should
have
known
of
it
in
a
natural
way
this
event
having
spread
in
paris
they
thought
it
was
the
effect
of
a
disturbed
imagination
or
a
story
and
whatever
might
be
said
by
the
persons
who
examined
the
thing
seriously
there
remained
in
minds
a
suspicion
which
time
alone
could
disperse
this
depended
upon
what
might
happen
to
marquis
de
precy
who
was
threatened
that
he
should
be
slain
in
the
first
engagement
thus
everyone
regarded
his
fate
as
the
of
the
piece
but
he
soon
confirmed
everything
they
had
doubted
the
truth
of
for
as
soon
as
he
recovered
from
his
illness
he
would
go
to
the
combat
of
st
antoine
although
his
father
and
mother
who
were
afraid
of
the
prophecy
said
all
they
could
to
prevent
him
he
was
killed
there
to
the
great
regret
of
all
his
family
xxxv
the
altheim
revenant
the
phantom
world
a
monk
of
the
abbey
of
toussaints
relates
that
on
the
of
september
a
man
named
john
steinlin
died
at
a
place
called
altheim
in
the
diocese
of
constance
steinlin
was
a
man
in
easy
circumstances
and
a
of
his
town
some
days
after
his
death
he
appeared
during
the
night
to
a
tailor
named
simon
bauh
in
the
form
of
a
man
surrounded
by
a
sombre
flame
like
that
of
lighted
sulphur
going
and
coming
in
his
own
house
but
without
speaking
bauh
who
was
disquieted
by
this
sight
resolved
to
ask
him
what
he
could
do
to
serve
him
he
found
an
opportunity
to
do
so
the
of
november
in
the
same
year
for
as
he
was
reposing
at
night
near
his
stove
a
little
after
eleven
he
beheld
this
spectre
environed
by
fire
like
sulphur
who
came
into
his
room
going
and
coming
shutting
and
opening
the
windows
the
tailor
asked
him
what
he
desired
he
replied
in
a
hoarse
interrupted
voice
that
he
could
help
very
much
if
he
would
but
added
he
do
not
promise
me
to
do
so
if
you
are
not
resolved
to
execute
your
promises
i
will
execute
them
if
they
are
not
beyond
my
power
replied
he
i
wish
then
replied
the
spirit
that
you
would
cause
a
mass
to
be
said
in
the
chapel
of
the
virgin
at
rotembourg
i
made
a
vow
to
that
intent
during
my
life
and
i
have
not
acquitted
myself
of
it
moreover
you
must
have
two
masses
said
at
altheim
the
one
of
the
defunct
and
the
other
of
the
virgin
and
as
i
did
not
always
pay
my
servants
exactly
i
wish
that
a
quarter
of
corn
should
be
distributed
to
the
poor
simon
promised
to
satisfy
him
on
all
these
points
the
spectre
held
out
his
hand
as
if
to
ensure
his
promise
but
simon
fearing
that
some
harm
might
happen
to
himself
tendered
him
the
board
which
came
to
hand
and
the
spectre
having
touched
it
left
the
print
of
his
hand
with
the
four
fingers
and
thumb
as
if
fire
had
been
there
and
had
left
a
pretty
deep
impression
after
that
he
vanished
with
so
much
noise
that
it
was
heard
three
houses
off
xxxvi
sertorius
and
his
hind
north
plutarch
so
soone
as
sertorius
arriued
from
africa
he
straight
leauied
men
of
warre
and
with
them
subdued
the
people
of
spaine
fronting
upon
his
marches
of
which
the
more
part
did
willingly
submit
themselues
upon
the
bruit
that
ran
of
him
to
be
merciful
and
courteous
and
a
valiant
man
besides
in
present
danger
furthermore
he
lacked
no
fine
deuises
and
subtilties
to
win
their
goodwills
as
among
others
the
policy
and
deuise
of
the
hind
there
was
a
poore
man
of
the
countrey
called
spanus
who
meeting
by
chance
one
day
with
a
hind
in
his
way
that
had
newly
calued
flying
from
the
hunters
he
let
the
damme
go
not
being
able
to
take
her
and
running
after
her
calfe
tooke
it
which
was
a
young
hind
and
of
a
strange
haire
for
she
was
all
it
chanced
so
that
sertorius
was
at
that
time
in
those
parts
so
this
poore
man
presented
sertorius
with
his
young
hind
which
he
gladly
receiued
and
which
with
time
he
made
so
tame
that
she
would
come
to
him
when
he
called
her
and
follow
him
whereeuer
he
went
being
nothing
the
wilder
for
the
daily
sight
of
such
a
number
of
armed
souldiers
together
as
they
were
nor
yet
afraid
of
the
noise
and
tumult
of
the
campe
insomuch
as
sertorius
by
little
and
little
made
it
a
miracle
making
the
simple
barbarous
people
beleeue
that
it
was
a
gift
that
diana
had
sent
him
by
the
which
she
made
him
understand
of
many
and
sundrie
things
to
come
knowing
well
inough
of
himselfe
that
the
barbarous
people
were
men
easily
deceiued
and
quickly
caught
by
any
subtill
superstition
besides
that
by
art
also
he
brought
them
to
beleeue
it
as
a
thing
verie
true
for
when
he
had
any
secret
intelligence
giuen
him
that
the
enemies
would
inuade
some
part
of
the
countries
and
prouinces
subject
vnto
him
or
that
they
had
taken
any
of
his
forts
from
him
by
any
intelligence
or
sudden
attempt
he
straight
told
them
that
his
hind
spake
to
him
as
he
slept
and
had
warned
him
both
to
arme
his
men
and
put
himselfe
in
strength
in
like
manner
if
he
had
heard
any
newes
that
one
of
his
lieutenants
had
wonne
a
battell
or
that
he
had
any
aduantage
of
his
enemies
he
would
hide
the
messenger
and
bring
his
hind
abroad
with
a
garland
and
coller
of
nosegayes
and
then
say
it
was
a
token
of
some
good
newes
comming
towards
him
perswading
them
withall
to
be
of
good
cheare
and
so
did
sacrifice
to
the
gods
to
giue
them
thankes
for
the
good
tidings
he
should
heare
before
it
were
long
thus
by
putting
this
superstition
into
their
heades
he
made
them
the
more
tractable
and
obedient
to
his
will
in
so
much
as
they
thought
they
were
not
now
gouerned
any
more
by
a
stranger
wiser
than
themselues
but
were
steadfastly
perswaded
that
they
were
rather
led
by
some
certaine
now
was
sertorius
very
heauie
that
no
man
could
tell
him
what
was
become
of
his
white
hind
for
thereby
all
his
subtilltie
and
finenesse
to
keepe
the
barbarous
people
in
obedience
was
taken
away
and
then
specially
when
they
stood
in
need
of
most
comfort
but
by
good
hap
certaine
of
his
souldiers
that
had
lost
themselves
in
the
night
met
with
the
hind
in
their
way
and
knowing
her
by
her
colour
tooke
her
and
brought
her
backe
againe
sertorius
hearing
of
her
promised
them
a
good
reward
so
that
they
would
tell
no
liuing
creature
that
they
brought
her
againe
and
thereupon
made
her
to
be
secretly
kept
then
within
a
few
dayes
after
he
came
abroad
among
them
and
with
a
pleasant
countenance
told
the
noble
men
and
chiefe
captaines
of
these
barbarous
people
how
the
gods
had
reuealed
it
to
him
in
his
dreame
that
he
should
shortly
haue
a
maruellous
good
thing
happen
to
him
and
with
these
words
sate
downe
in
his
chaire
to
giue
audience
whereupon
they
that
kept
the
hind
not
farre
from
thence
did
secretly
let
her
go
the
hind
being
loose
when
she
had
spied
sertorius
ranne
straight
to
his
chaire
with
great
joy
and
put
her
head
betwixt
his
legges
and
layed
her
mouth
in
his
right
hand
as
she
before
was
wont
to
do
sertorius
also
made
very
much
of
her
and
of
purpose
appeared
maruellous
glad
shewing
much
tender
affection
to
the
hind
as
it
seemed
the
water
stood
in
his
eyes
for
joy
the
barbarous
people
that
stood
there
by
and
beheld
the
same
at
the
first
were
much
amazed
therewith
but
afterwards
when
they
had
better
bethought
themselues
for
ioy
they
clapped
their
hands
together
and
waited
upon
sertorius
to
his
lodging
with
great
and
ioyfull
shouts
saying
and
steadfastly
beleeuing
that
he
was
a
heavenly

snatch
me
from
this
posture
of
doubt
let
me
not
blindly
rush
on
and
blindly
fall
extort
this
secret
from
the
gods
or
force
the
dead
to
confess
what
they
know
to
whom
the
thessalian
crone
replied
if
you
asked
to
change
the
fate
of
an
individual
though
it
were
to
restore
an
old
man
decrepit
with
age
to
vigorous
youth
i
could
comply
but
to
break
the
eternal
chain
of
causes
and
consequences
exceeds
even
our
power
you
seek
however
only
a
foreknowledge
of
events
to
come
and
you
shall
be
gratified
meanwhile
it
were
best
where
slaughter
has
afforded
so
ample
a
field
to
select
the
body
of
one
newly
deceased
and
whose
flexible
organs
shall
be
yet
capable
of
speech
not
with
lineaments
already
hardened
in
the
sun
saying
thus
erichtho
proceeded
having
first
with
her
art
made
the
night
itself
more
dark
and
involved
her
head
in
a
pitchy
cloud
to
explore
the
field
and
examine
one
by
one
the
bodies
of
the
unburied
dead
as
she
approached
the
wolves
fled
before
her
and
the
birds
of
prey
unwillingly
sheathing
their
talons
abandoned
their
repast
while
the
thessalian
witch
searching
into
the
vital
parts
of
the
frames
before
her
at
length
fixed
on
one
whose
lungs
were
uninjured
and
whose
organs
of
speech
had
sustained
no
wound
the
fate
of
many
hung
in
doubt
till
she
had
made
her
selection
had
the
revival
of
whole
armies
been
her
will
armies
would
have
stood
up
obedient
to
her
bidding
she
passed
a
hook
beneath
the
jaw
of
the
selected
one
and
fastening
it
to
a
cord
dragged
him
along
over
rocks
and
stones
till
she
reached
a
cave
overhung
by
a
projecting
ridge
a
gloomy
fissure
in
the
ground
was
there
of
a
depth
almost
reaching
to
the
infernal
gods
where
the
spread
thick
its
horizontal
branches
at
all
times
excluding
the
light
of
the
sun
fearful
and
withering
shade
was
there
and
noisome
slime
cherished
by
the
livelong
night
the
air
was
heavy
and
flagging
as
that
of
the
tænarian
promontory
and
hither
the
god
of
hell
permits
his
ghosts
to
extend
their
wanderings
it
is
doubtful
whether
the
sorceress
called
up
the
dead
to
attend
her
here
or
herself
descended
to
the
abodes
of
pluto
she
put
on
a
fearful
and
variegated
robe
she
covered
her
face
with
her
dishevelled
hair
and
bound
her
brow
with
a
wreath
of
vipers
meanwhile
she
observed
sextus
afraid
with
his
eyes
fixed
on
the
ground
and
his
companions
trembling
and
thus
she
reproached
them
lay
aside
she
said
your
terrors
you
shall
behold
only
a
living
and
a
human
figure
whose
accents
you
may
listen
to
with
perfect
security
if
this
alarms
you
what
would
you
say
if
you
should
have
seen
the
stygian
lakes
and
the
shores
burning
with
sulphur
unconsumed
if
the
furies
stood
before
you
and
cerberus
with
his
mane
of
vipers
and
the
giants
chained
in
eternal
adamant
yet
all
these
you
might
have
witnessed
unharmed
for
all
these
would
quail
at
the
terror
of
my
brow
she
spoke
and
next
plied
the
dead
body
with
her
arts
she
supples
his
wounds
and
infuses
fresh
blood
into
his
veins
she
frees
his
scars
from
the
clotted
gore
and
penetrates
them
with
froth
from
the
moon
she
mixes
whatever
nature
has
engendered
in
its
most
fearful
caprices
foam
from
the
jaws
of
a
mad
dog
the
entrails
of
the
lynx
the
backbone
of
the
hyena
and
the
marrow
of
a
stag
that
had
dieted
on
serpents
the
sinews
of
the
remora
and
the
eyes
of
a
dragon
the
eggs
of
the
eagle
the
flying
serpent
of
arabia
the
viper
that
guards
the
pearl
in
the
red
sea
the
slough
of
the
hooded
snake
and
the
ashes
that
remain
when
the
phoenix
has
been
consumed
to
these
she
adds
all
venom
that
has
a
name
the
foliage
of
herbs
over
which
she
has
sung
her
charms
and
on
which
she
had
voided
her
rheum
as
they
grew
at
length
she
chants
her
incantation
to
the
stygian
gods
in
a
voice
compounded
of
all
discords
and
altogether
alien
to
human
organs
it
resembles
at
once
the
barking
of
a
dog
and
the
howl
of
a
wolf
it
consists
of
the
hooting
of
the
the
yelling
of
a
ravenous
wild
beast
and
the
fearful
hiss
of
a
serpent
it
borrows
somewhat
from
the
roar
of
tempestuous
waves
the
hollow
rushing
of
the
winds
among
the
branches
of
the
forest
and
the
tremendous
crash
of
deafening
thunder
ye
furies
she
cries
and
dreadful
styx
ye
sufferings
of
the
damned
and
chaos
for
ever
eager
to
destroy
the
fair
harmony
of
worlds
and
thou
pluto
condemned
to
an
eternity
of
ungrateful

was

him
thou

bury

never

we
sit
at

together

upon
me
hateful
doom
hath
gaped
doom
which
was
my
portion
even
at

thee
thyself
also

thou
peer
of

is
fated
to
perish
beneath

i
will
tell
thee
and

straitly
charge
thee
if
peradventure
thou
wilt
hearken
lay
not
my
bones
apart
from
thine
achilles
but
side
by
side
for
we
were
brought
up
together
in
thy
house
when
menoitios
brought
me
a
child
from
opöeis
to
thy
father
house
because
of
woeful
bloodshed
on
the
day
when
i
slew
the
son
of
amphidamas
myself
a
child
unwittingly

in
wrath
over

games
then
did
peleus
the
knight
take
me
into

rear
me
kindly
and
name
me
thy
squire
so
let
one
urn
also
hide
the
bones
of
us
both
and
achilles

him

said
why
dearest
and
hast
thou
come
hither
to
lay
upon

these
thy
several
behests
of
a
truth
i
will
accomplish
all
and

to
thy

stand
nearer

pray
for
a

let
us
cast
our

about

other
and
take
our
fill
of
dire
sorrow
with

stretched
forth
his

to

him

not

like
a

the
spirit
vanished
earthward
with
a
wailing
cry
amazed
achilles
sprang
up

smote
his

together
and

is
there
no

of

vision
of
cromwell
by
arise
evans
a
vision
that
i
had
presently
after
the
king
death
i
thought
that
i
was
in
a
great
hall
like
the
king
hall
or
the
castle
in
winchester
and
there
was
none
there
but
a
judge
that
sat
upon
the
bench
and
myself
and
as
i
turned
to
a
window
in
the
and
looking
into
the
palm
of
my
hand
there
appeared
to
me
a
face
head
and
shoulders
like
the
lord
fairfax
and
presently
it
vanished
again
there
arose
the
lord
cromwell
and
he
vanished
likewise
then
arose
a
young
face
and
he
had
a
crown
upon
his
head
and
he
vanished
also
and
another
young
face
arose
with
a
crown
upon
his
head
and
he
vanished
also
and
another
young
face
arose
with
a
crown
upon
his
head
and
vanished
in
like
manner
and
as
i
turned
the
palm
of
my
hand
back
again
to
me
and
looked
there
did
appear
no
more
in
it
then
i
turned
to
the
judge
and
said
to
him
there
arose
in
my
hand
seven
and
five
of
them
had
crowns
but
when
i
turned
my
hand
the
blood
turned
to
its
veins
and
these
appeared
no
more
so
i
awoke
the
interpretation
of
this
vision
is
that
after
the
lord
cromwell
there
shall
be
kings
again
in
england
which
thing
is
signified
unto
us
by
those
that
arose
after
him
who
were
all
crowned
but
the
generations
to
come
may
look
for
a
change
of
the
blood

of
the

warning
by

in
the
rev
john
mastin
of
is
cited
a
story
of
an
apparition
that
was
supposed
to
have
appeared
to
charles
the
first
at
daintree
near
naseby
previous
to
the
famous
battle
of
that
name
the
army
of
charles
says
the
historian
consisting
of
less
than
foot
and
about
as
many
horse
was
ordered
to
daintree
whither
the
king
went
with
a
thorough
resolution
of
fighting
the
next
day
however
to
the
surprise
of
prince
rupert
and
all
the
rest
of
the
army
this
design
was
given
up
and
the
former
one
of
going
to
the
north
resumed
the
reason
of
this
alteration
in
his
plans
was
alleged
to
be
some
presages
of
which
the
king
had
received
and
which
were
related
to
me
says
mr
mastin
authority
by
a
person
of
newark
at
that
time
in
his
majesty
horse
about
two
hours
after
the
king
had
retired
to
rest
said
the
narrator
some
of
his
attendants
hearing
an
uncommon
noise
in
his
chamber
went
into
it
where
they
found
his
majesty
sitting
up
in
bed
and
much
agitated
but
nothing
which
could
have
produced
the
noise
they
fancied
they
had
heard
the
king
in
a
tremulous
voice
inquired
after
the
cause
of
their
alarm
and
told
them
how
much
he
had
been
disturbed
apparently
by
a
dream
by
thinking
he
had
seen
an
apparition
of
lord
strafford
who
after
upbraiding
him
for
his
cruelty
told
him
he
was
come
to
return
him
good
for
evil
and
that
he
advised
him
by
no
means
to
fight
the
parliament
army
that
was
at
that
time
quartered
at
northampton
for
it
was
one
which
the
king
could
never
conquer
by
arms
prince
rupert
in
whom
courage
was
the
predominant
quality
rated
the
king
out
of
his
apprehensions
the
next
day
and
a
resolution
was
again
taken
to
meet
the
enemy
the
next
night
however
the
apparition
appeared
to
him
a
second
time
but
with
looks
of
anger
assuring
him
that
would
be
the
last
advice
he
should
be
permitted
to
give
him
but
that
if
he
kept
his
resolution
of
fighting
he
was
undone
if
his
majesty
had
taken
the
advice
of
the
friendly
ghost
and
marched
northward
the
next
day
where
the
parliament
had
few
english
forces
and
where
the
scots
were
becoming
very
discontented
his
affairs
might
perhaps
still
have
had
a
prosperous
issue
or
if
he
had
marched
immediately
into
the
west
he
might
afterwards
have
fought
on
more
equal
terms
but
the
king
fluctuating
between
the
apprehensions
of
his
imagination
and
the
reproaches
of
his
courage
remained
another
whole
day
at
daintree
in
a
state
of
inactivity
the
battle
of
naseby
fought
june
put
a
finishing
stroke
to
the
king
affairs
after
this
he
could
never
get
together
an
army
fit
to
look
the
enemy
in
the
face
he
was
often
heard
to
say
that
he
wished
he
had
taken
and
not
fought
at
naseby
the
meaning
of
which
nobody
knew
but
those
to
whom
he
had
told
of
the
apparition
which
he
had
seen
at
daintree
and
all
of
whom
were
subsequently
charged
to
keep
the
affair
secret

kotter
red
circle
from
ferrier
apparitions
kotter
first
vision
was
detailed
by
him
on
oath
before
the
magistrates
of
sprottaw
in
while
he
was
travelling
on
foot
in
open
daylight
in
june
a
man
appeared
to
him
who
ordered
him
to
inform
the
civil
and
ecclesiastical
authorities
that
great
evils
were
impending
over
germany
for
the
punishment
of
the
sins
of
the
people
after
which
he
vanished
the
same
apparition
met
him
at
different
times
and
compelled
him
at
length
by
threats
to
make
this
public
declaration
after
this
his
visions
assumed
a
more
imposing
appearance
on
one
occasion
the
angel
for
such
he
was
now
confessed
to
be
showed
him
three
suns
filling
one
half
of
the
heavens
and
nine
moons
with
their
horns
turned
towards
the
east
filling
the
other
half
at
the
same
time
a
superb
fountain
of
pure
water
spouted
from
the
arid
soil
under
his
feet
at
another
time
he
beheld
a
mighty
lion
treading
on
the
moon
and
seven
other
lions
around
him
in
the
clouds
sometimes
he
beheld
the
encounter
of
hostile
armies
splendidly
accoutred
sometimes
he
wandered
through
palaces
whose
only
inhabitants
were
devouring
monsters
or
beheld
dragons
of
enormous
size
in
various
scenes
of
action
he
was
at
length
attended
by
two
angels
in
his
ecstasy
one
of
his
visions
at
this
time
was
of
the
most
formidable
and
impressive
kind
on
the
day
of
september
says
he
both
the
youths
returned
to
me
saying
be
not
afraid
but
observe
the
thing
which
will
be
shewn
to
thee
and
i
suddenly
beheld
a
circle
like
the
sun
red
and
as
it
were
bloody
in
which
were
black
and
white
lines
or
spots
so
intermingled
that
sometimes
there
appeared
a
greater
number
of
blacks
sometimes
of
white
and
this
sight
continued
for
some
space
of
time
and
when
they
had
said
to
me
behold
attend
fear
not
no
evil
will
befal
thee
lo
there
were
three
successive
peals
of
thunder
at
short
intervals
so
loud
and
dreadful
that
i
shuddered
all
over
but
the
circle
stood
before
me
and
the
black
and
white
spots
were
disunited
and
the
circle
approached
so
near
that
i
could
have
touched
it
with
my
hand
and
it
was
so
beautiful
that
i
had
never
in
my
life
seen
any
thing
more
agreeable
and
the
white
spots
were
so
bright
and
pleasant
that
i
could
not
contain
my
admiration
but
the
black
spots
were
carried
away
in
cloud
of
horrible
darkness
in
which
i
heard
a
dismal
outcry
though
i
could
see
no
one
yet
these
words
of
lamentation
were
audible
woe
unto
us
who
have
committed
ourselves
unto
the
black
cloud
to
be
withdrawn
from
the
circle
coloured
with
the
blood
of
divine
grace
in
which
the
grace
of
god
in
his
son
had
inclosed
us
after
several
other
piteous
exclamations
he
saw
a
procession
of
many
thousand
persons
bearing
palms
and
singing
hymns
but
of
very
small
stature
enter
the
red
circle
from
the
black
cloud
chanting

the
vision
of
charles
xi
of
sweden
from
a
the
authenticity
of
the
following
narrative
rests
upon
a
drawn
out
in
form
and
attested
by
the
signatures
of
four
credible
witnesses
charles
xi
was
one
of
the
most
despotic
and
at
the
same
time
one
of
the
ablest
monarchs
that
ever
ruled
the
destinies
of
sweden
history
represents
him
as
brave
and
enlightened
but
of
a
harsh
and
inflexible
disposition
regulating
his
opinions
by
positive
facts
and
wholly
ungifted
with
imagination
at
the
period
of
which
we
are
about
to
speak
death
had
bereaved
him
of
his
queen
ulrica
eleonora
notwithstanding
the
harshness
which
had
marked
his
conduct
to
the
princess
during
her
lifetime
and
which
in
the
opinion
of
his
subjects
had
precipitated
her
into
the
grave
charles
revered
her
memory
and
appeared
more
affected
by
her
loss
than
might
have
been
imagined
from
the
natural
sternness
of
his
character
subsequently
to
this
event
he
became
more
gloomy
and
taciturn
than
before
and
devoted
himself
to
study
with
an
intensity
of
application
that
evinced
his
anxiety
to
escape
the
tortures
of
his
own
painful
reflections
towards
the
close
of
a
dreary
autumnal
evening
the
king
in
slippers
and
de
was
seated
before
a
large
fire
in
a
private
cabinet
of
his
palace
at
stockholm
near
him
were
his
grand
chamberlain
the
count
de
brahe
who
was
honoured
with
the
favourite
estimation
of
his
sovereign
and
the
principal
state
physician
baumgarten
a
learned
disciple
of
hippocrates
who
aimed
at
the
reputation
of
an
and
who
would
have
pardoned
a
disbelief
in
anything
except
in
the
efficacy
of
his
own
prescriptions
the
personage
had
on
that
evening
been
hastily
summoned
to
the
presence
of
the
monarch
who
felt
or
fancied
himself
in
need
of
his
professional
skill
the
evening
was
already
far
advanced
and
the
king
contrary
to
his
wont
delayed
bidding
the
customary
goodnight
to
all
the
signal
at
which
his
guests
always
retired
with
his
head
bent
down
and
his
eyes
fixed
upon
the
decaying
embers
that
gradually
withdrew
even
their
mockery
of
warmth
from
the
spacious
fireplace
he
maintained
a
strict
silence
evidently
fatigued
with
his
company
yet
dreading
though
he
scarcely
knew
why
to
be
left
alone
the
grand
chamberlain
who
perceived
that
even
his
profound
remarks
failed
to
excite
the
attention
of
the
monarch
ventured
to
hint
that
his
majesty
would
do
well
to
seek
repose
a
gesture
of
the
king
retained
him
in
his
place
the
physician
in
his
turn
hazarded
a
casual
observation
on
the
injurious
tendency
of
late
hours
the
significant
innuendoes
were
however
thrown
away
on
charles
who
replied
to
them
by
muttering
between
his
teeth
you
may
remain
i
have
no
wish
to
sleep
this
permission
with
which
the
drowsy
courtiers
would
willingly
have
dispensed
but
which
was
really
equivalent
to
a
command
was
succeeded
by
an
attempt
on
their
part
to
enliven
his
majesty
with
different
subjects
of
conversation
no
topic
however
that
they
introduced
could
outlive
the
second
or
third
phrase
the
king
was
in
one
of
his
gloomy
moods
for
royalty
with
reverence
be
it
spoken
has
its
moments
of
merriment
and
its
mixture
of
sunshine
and
of
cloud
and
be
it
known
to
thee
gentle
reader
that
ticklish
is
the
position
of
a
courtier
when
majesty
is
in
the
dumps
to
mend
or
rather
to
mar
the
matter
the
grand
chamberlain
imagining
that
the
sadness
which
overshadowed
the
royal
brow
came
from
regret
fixed
his
eyes
upon
a
portrait
of
the
queen
hung
up
in
the
cabinet
and
with
a
sigh
of
pathos
exclaimed
how
striking
the
resemblance
and
who
could
not
recognise
the
expression
of
majesty
and
gentleness
that
fudge
cried
the
king
conscience
had
probably
something
to
do
with
the
abruptness
of
the
exclamation
the
old
chamberlain
had
unwittingly
touched
a
tender
chord
every
allusion
to
the
queen
appearing
like
a
tacit
reproach
to
the
august
and
widowed
spouse
that
portrait
added
the
king
is
too
flattering
the
queen
was
far
from
handsome
then
as
if
inwardly
repentant
of
his
harshness
he
rose
from
his
seat
and
paced
the
apartment
with
hasty
strides
to
conceal
the
tears
that
had
betrayed
his
emotion
he
sat
in
the
embrasure
of
a
window
which
looked
upon
the
court
the
moon
was
obscured
by
a
thick
veil
of
clouds
not
even
a
solitary
star
twinkled
through
the
darkness
the
palace
at
present
inhabited
by
the
kings
of
sweden
was
not
at
that
time
finished
and
charles
in
whose
reign
it
had
been
commenced
usually
resided
in
an
edifice
built
something
in
the
shape
of
a
horseshoe
and
situated
at
the
point
of
ritterholm
commanding
a
view
of
lake
mader
the
royal
cabinet
was
at
one
of
the
extremities
nearly
opposite
to
the
grand
hall
or
in
which
the
states
were
accustomed
to
assemble
when
a
message
or
communication
from
the
crown
was
expected
just
at
this
moment
the
windows
of
the
appeared
brilliantly
illuminated
the
king
was
lost
in
surprise
he
at
first
imagined
the
light
to
proceed
from
the
torch
of
some
domestic
yet
what
could
occasion
so
unseasonable
a
visit
to
a
place
that
for
a
considerable
time
had
been
closed
besides
the
light
was
too
vivid
to
be
produced
by
one
single
torch
it
might
have
been
attributed
to
a
conflagration
but
no
smoke
was
perceptible
no
noise
was
heard
the
window
glasses
were
not
broken
everything
in
short
seemed
to
indicate
an
illumination
such
as
takes
place
on
public
and
solemn
occasions
charles
without
uttering
a
word
remained
gazing
at
the
windows
of
the
the
count
brahe
who
had
already
grasped
the
was
on
the
point
of
summoning
a
page
in
order
to
ascertain
the
cause
of
this
singular
illumination
when
the
king
suddenly
prevented
him
i
will
visit
the
chamber
myself
said
his
majesty
the
seriousness
of
his
deportment
and
the
paleness
of
his
countenance
indicating
a
strange
mixture
of
determination
and
superstitious
awe
he
quitted
the
cabinet
with
the
unhesitating
step
of
one
resolved
to
obtain
mastery
over
himself
the
legislator
of
etiquette
and
the
regulator
of
bodies
each
with
a
lighted
taper
followed
him
with
fear
and
trembling
the
keeper
of
the
keys
had
already
retired
to
rest
baumgarten
was
despatched
by
the
king
to
awaken
him
and
to
order
him
forthwith
to
open
the
doors
of
the
unbounded
was
the
worthy
keeper
surprise
at
the
unexpected
intimation
benign
providence
however
has
ordained
monarchs
to
command
and
created
keepers
of
keys
to
obey
the
prudent
cerberus
yawned
dressed
himself
in
haste
and
presented
himself
before
his
sovereign
with
the
insignia
of
his
office
a
bunch
of
keys
of
various
dimensions
suspended
at
his
girdle
he
commenced
by
opening
the
door
of
a
gallery
which
served
as
a
sort
of
to
the
the
king
entered
but
his
astonishment
may
be
conceived
on
finding
the
walls
of
the
building
entirely
hung
with
black
by
whose
order
has
this
been
done
demanded
the
king
in
a
tone
of
anger
sire
replied
the
trembling
keeper
of
the
keys
i
am
ignorant
the
last
time
the
gallery
was
opened
it
was
wainscoted
with
oak
as
usual
most
assuredly
these
hangings
are
not
from
your
majesty
wardrobe
the
king
however
had
by
this
time
traversed
at
a
rapid
pace
of
the
gallery
without
stopping
to
avail
himself
of
the
worshipful
conjectures
the
latter
personage
and
the
grand
chamberlain
followed
his
majesty
whilst
the
learned
doctor
lingered
a
little
in
the
rear
sire
cried
the
keeper
of
the
keys
i
beseech
your
majesty
to
go
no
farther
as
i
have
a
living
soul
there
is
witchcraft
in
this
matter
at
this
hour
and
since
the
death
of
the
queen
god
be
gracious
to
us
it
is
said
that
her
majesty
walks
every
night
in
this
gallery
hold
sire
cried
the
count
in
his
turn
do
you
not
hear
a
strange
noise
which
seems
to
proceed
from
the
who
can
foresee
the
danger
to
which
your
majesty
may
expose
your
sacred
person
forward
replied
the
resolute
monarch
in
an
imperative
tone
and
as
he
stopped
before
the
door
of
the
quick
your
keys
said
he
to
the
keeper
he
pushed
the
door
violently
with
his
foot
and
the
noise
repeated
by
the
echoes
of
the
vaulted
roof
resounded
through
the
gallery
like
the
report
of
a
cannon
the
old
keeper
trembled
he
tried
one
key
then
another
but
without
success
his
hand
shook
his
sight
was
confused
a
soldier
and
afraid
cried
charles
with
a
smile
come
count
you
must
be
our
usher
open
that
door
sire
replied
the
grand
chamberlain
stepping
backwards
if
your
majesty
command
me
to
walk
up
to
the
mouth
of
a
danish
cannon
i
will
obey
on
the
instant
but
you
will
not
order
me
to
combat
with
the
devil
and
his
imps
the
monarch
snatched
the
keys
from
the
palsied
hands
of
the
infirm
old
keeper
i
see
said
his
majesty
in
a
tone
of
contempt
that
i
must
finish
this
adventure
and
before
his
terrified
suite
could
prevent
his
design
he
had
already
opened
the
massy
oaken
door
and
penetrated
into
the
first
pronouncing
the
usual
formula
with
the
help
of
god
the
companions
of
his
midnight
excursion
entered
along
with
him
prompted
by
a
sentiment
of
curiosity
stronger
on
this
occasion
even
than
terror
their
courage
too
was
reinforced
by
a
feeling
of
shame
which
forbade
them
to
abandon
their
sovereign
in
the
hour
of
peril
the
was
illuminated
with
an
immense
number
of
torches
the
ancient
figured
tapestry
had
been
replaced
by
a
black
drapery
suspended
on
the
walls
along
which
were
ranged
in
regular
order
and
according
to
the
custom
of
those
days
german
danish
and
muscovite
banners
trophies
of
the
victories
won
by
the
soldiers
of
gustavus
adolphus
in
the
middle
were
distinguished
the
banners
of
sweden
covered
with
black
crape
a
numerous
assemblage
was
seated
on
the
benches
of
the
hall
the
four
orders
of
the
state
the
nobility
the
clergy
the
citizens
and
the
peasants
were
ranged
according
to
the
respective
disposition
assigned
to
each
all
were
clothed
in
black
and
the
multitude
of
human
faces
that
shone
like
so
many
luminous
rays
upon
a
dark
ground
dazzled
the
sight
to
such
a
degree
that
of
the
four
individuals
who
witnessed
this
extraordinary
scene
not
one
could
discern
amidst
the
crowd
a
countenance
with
which
he
was
familiar
the
position
of
the
four
spectators
might
have
been
compared
to
that
of
actors
who
in
presence
of
a
numerous
audience
were
incapable
of
distinguishing
a
single
face
among
the
confused
mass
on
the
elevated
throne
whence
the
monarch
habitually
harangued
the
assembly
of
the
states
was
seated
a
bleeding
corpse
invested
with
the
emblems
of
royalty
on
the
right
of
this
apparition
stood
a
child
a
crown
upon
his
head
and
the
sceptre
in
his
hand
on
the
left
an
aged
man
or
rather
another
phantom
leaned
upon
the
throne
opposite
to
which
were
several
personages
of
austere
and
solemn
demeanour
clothed
in
long
black
robes
and
seated
before
a
table
covered
with
thick
folios
and
parchments
from
the
gravity
of
their
deportment
the
latter
seemed
to
be
judges
between
the
throne
and
the
portion
of
the
above
which
it
was
elevated
were
placed
an
axe
and
a
block
covered
with
black
crape
in
this
unearthly
assembly
none
seemed
at
all
conscious
of
the
presence
of
charles
or
of
the
three
individuals
by
whom
he
was
accompanied
at
last
the
oldest
of
the
judges
in
black
robes
he
who
appeared
to
discharge
the
functions
of
president
rising
with
dignity
struck
three
times
with
his
hand
upon
an
open
folio
profound
silence
immediately
succeeded
some
youths
of
distinguished
appearance
richly
dressed
and
with
their
hands
fettered
behind
their
backs
were
led
into
the
by
a
door
opposite
to
that
which
charles
had
opened
behind
them
a
man
of
vigrous
mould
held
the
extremity
of
the
cord
with
which
their
hands
were
pinioned
the
prisoner
who
marched
in
the
foremost
rank
and
whose
air
was
more
imposing
than
that
of
the
others
stopped
in
the
midst
of
the
before
the
block
which
he
seemed
to
contemplate
with
haughty
disdain
at
the
same
instant
the
corse
seated
on
the
throne
was
agitated
by
a
convulsive
tremor
and
the
purple
tide
flowed
afresh
from
his
wounds
the
youthful
prisoner
knelt
upon
the
ground
and
laid
his
head
upon
the
block
the
fatal
axe
glittering
in
the
air
descended
swiftly
a
stream
of
blood
forced
its
way
even
to
the
platform
of
the
throne
and
mingled
with
that
of

assemblage
became

at
last
they
resembled
a
mass
of
coloured
shadows
soon
after
which
they
disappeared
altogether
the
fantastic
torches
were
extinguished
of
themselves
and
those
of
charles
and
his
suite
cast
their
dim
flickering
light
upon
the
tapestry
with
which
the
chamber
was
usually
hung
and
which
was
now
slightly
moved
by
the
wind
during
some
minutes
longer
a
strange
sort
of
melody
was
heard
a
harmony
compared
by
one
of
the
of
this
unparalleled
scene
to
the
murmur
of
the
breeze
agitating
the
foliage

by

sound
emitted

to

had
inundated

had
disappeared
with

every
trace
had
vanished
except
a
crimson
spot
which
still
stained
the
slipper
of
charles
and
which
alone
would
have
sufficed
to
remind
him
of
the
horrid
vision
had
it
been
possible
for
any
effort
to
erase
it
from
his
memory
returning
to
his
private
cabinet
the
king
committed
to

an
exact
relation
of
what
he
had
seen
signed
it
and
ordered
his
companions
to
do
the

of
the
precautions
taken
to
conceal
the
contents
of

statement
from

soon
transpired

an
apprehension

denis
misanger
de
la

eighteen
years
of
age
was
attacked
with
an
extraordinary
malady
which
began
by
a
sort
of
lethargy
they
gave
him
every
assistance
that
medicine
and
surgery
could
afford
he
fell
afterwards
into
a
kind
of
furor
or
convulsion
and
they
were
obliged
to
hold
him
and
have
five
or
six
persons
to
keep
watch
over
him
for
fear
that
he
should
throw
himself
out
of
the
windows
or
break
his
head
against
the
wall
the
emetic
which
they
gave
him
made
him
throw
up
a
quantity
of
bile
and
for
four
or
five
days
he
remained
pretty
quiet
at
the
end
of
the
month
of
may
they
sent
him
into
the
country
to
take
the
air
and
some
other
circumstances
occurred
so
unusual
that
they
judged
he
must
be
bewitched
and
what
confirmed
this
conjecture
was
that
he
never
had
any
fever
and
retained
all
his
strength
notwithstanding
all
the
pains
and
violent
remedies
which
he
had
been
made
to
take
they
asked
him
if
he
had
not
had
some
dispute
with
a
shepherd
or
some
other
person
suspected
of
sorcery
or
malpractices
he
declared
that
on
the
of
april
preceding
when
he
was
going
through
the
village
of
noysi
on
horseback
for
a
ride
his
horse
stopped
short
in
the
midst
of
the
opposite
the
chapel
and
he
could
not
make
him
go
forward
though
he
touched
him
several
times
with
the
spur
there
was
a
shepherd
standing
leaning
against
the
chapel
with
his
crook
in
his
hand
and
two
black
dogs
at
his
side
this
man
said
to
him
sir
i
advise
you
to
return
home
for
your
horse
will
not
go
forward
the
young
la

continuing
to
spur
his
horse
said
to
the
shepherd
i
do
not
understand
what
you
say
the
shepherd
replied
in
a
low
tone
i
will
make
you
understand
in
effect
the
young
man
was
obliged
to
get
down
from
his
horse
and
lead
it
back
by
the
bridle
to
his
father
dwelling
in
the
same
village
then
the
shepherd
cast
a
spell
upon
him
which
was
to
take
effect
on
the
of
may
as
was
afterwards
known
during
this
malady
they
caused
several
masses
to
be
said
in

of

which
were
said
at

but
he
declared
that
he
should
not
be
cured
till

on
his
return
from
st
maur
on
entering
his
chamber
the
key
of
which
he
had
in
his
pocket
he
found
there
that
shepherd
seated
in
his
armchair
with
his
crook
and
his
two
black
dogs
he
was
the
only
person
who
saw
him
none
other
in
the
house
could
perceive
him
he
said
even
that
this
man
was
called
damis
although
he
did
not
remember
that
anyone
had
before
this
revealed
his
name
to
him
he
beheld
him
all
that
day
and
all
the
succeeding
night
towards
six
in
the
evening
as
he
felt
his
usual
sufferings
he
fell
on
the
ground
exclaiming
that
the
shepherd
was
upon
him
and
crushing
him
at
the
same
time
he
drew
his
knife
and
aimed
five
blows
at
the
shepherd
face
of
which
he
retained
the
marks
the
invalid
told
those
who
were
watching
over
him
that
he
was
going
to
be
very
faint
at
five
different
times
and
begged
of
them
to
help
him
and
move
him
violently
the
thing
happened
as
he
had
predicted
on
friday
the
june
de

having
gone
to
the
mass
at

asserted
that
he
should
be
cured
on
that
day
after
mass
the
priest
put
the
stole
upon
his
head
and
recited
the
gospel
of
st
john
during
which
prayer
the
young
man
saw
st
maur
standing
and
the
unhappy
shepherd
at
his
left
with
his
face
bleeding
from
the
five
which
he
had
given
him
at
that
moment
the
youth
cried
out
unintentionally
a
miracle

miracle
and
asserted
that
he
was
cured

in

he
was
on

of

returned
to

amused
himself
with
shooting
as
he
was
shooting
in

vineyards
the
shepherd
presented
himself
before
him
he
hit
him
on
the
head
with
the
of
his
gun
the
shepherd
cried
out
sir
you
are
killing
me
and
fled
the
next
day
this
man
presented
himself
again
before
him
and
asked
his
pardon
saying
i
am
called
damis
it
was
i
who
cast
a
spell
over
you
which
was
to
have
lasted
a
year
by
the
aid
of
masses
and
prayers
which
have
been
said
for
you
you
have
been
cured
at

of
eight
weeks

the
charm
has
fallen
back
upon
myself
and
i
can
be
cured

it
only

for

away

crook

such
a

ravaged

which
was
laid
up

was

came

unknown
person
of
taller
stature

dressed
in

robe
of

colours
who
engaged
to
deliver
them
from

scourge
for

certain
recompense
which
was
agreed
upon

he
drew
from
his
sleeve
a

at
the
sound
of
which
all
the
rats
came
out
of
their
holes
and
followed
him
he
led
them
straight
to

river
into
which
they
ran
and
were
drowned
on

return
he
asked
for
the
promised
reward

on
account
of
the
facility
with
which
he
had
exterminated

sent
her
off
with
sharp
into
lancashire
fourteen
days
after
one
graeme
a
fuller
who
lived
about
six
miles
from
lumley
had
been
engaged
till
past
midnight
in
his
mill
and
on
going
downstairs
to
go
home
in
the
middle
of
the
ground
floor
he
saw
a
woman
with
dishevelled
hair
covered
with
blood
and
having
five
large
wounds
on
her
head
graeme
on
recovering
a
little
from
his
first
terror
demanded
what
the
spectre
wanted
i
said
the
apparition
am
the
spirit
of
anne
walker
and
proceeded
accordingly
to
tell
graeme
the
particulars
which
i
have
already
related
to
you
when
i
was
sent
away
with
mark
sharp
he
slew
me
on
such
a
moor
naming
one
that
graeme
knew
with
a
pick
threw
my
body
into
a
and
hid
the
pick
under
the
bank
and
his
shoes
and
stockings
which
were
covered
with
blood
he
left
in
a
stream
the
apparition
proceeded
to
tell
graeme
that
he
must
give
information
of
this
to
the
nearest
justice
of
peace
and
that
till
this
was
done
he
must
look
to
be
continually
haunted
graeme
went
home
very
sad
he
dared
not
bring
such
a
charge
against
a
man
of
so
unimpeachable
a
character
as
walker
and
yet
he
as
little
dared
to
incur
the
anger
of
the
spirit
that
had
appeared
to
him
so
as
all
weak
minds
will
do
he
went
on
procrastinating
only
he
took
care
to
leave
his
mill
early
and
while
in
it
never
to
be
alone
notwithstanding
this
caution
on
his
part
one
night
just
as
it
began
to
be
dark
the
apparition
met
him
again
in
a
more
terrible
shape
and
with
every
circumstance
of
indignation
yet
he
did
not
even
then
fulfil
its
injunction
till
on
st
thomas
eve
as
he
was
walking
in
his
garden
just
after
sunset
it
threatened
him
so
effectually
that
in
the
morning
he
went
to
a
magistrate
and
revealed
the
whole
thing
the
place
was
examined
the
body
and
the
pickaxe
found
and
a
warrant
was
granted
against
walker
and
sharp
they
were
however
admitted
to
bail
but
in
august
their
trial
came
on
before
judge
davenport
at
durham
meanwhile
the
whole
circumstances
were
known
over
all
the
north
of
england
and
the
greatest
interest
was
excited
by
the
case
against
sharp
the
fact
was
strong
that
his
shoes
and
stockings
covered
with
blood
were
found
in
the
place
where
the
murder
had
been
committed
but
against
walker
except
the
account
received
from
the
ghost
there
seemed
not
a
shadow
of
evidence
nevertheless
the
judge
summed
up
strongly
against
the
prisoners
the
jury
found
them
guilty
and
the
judge
pronounced
sentence
upon
them
that
night
a
thing
which
was
unknown
in
durham
either
before
or
after
the
prisoners
were
executed
and
both
died
professing
their
innocence
to
the
last
judge
davenport
was
much
agitated
during
the
trial
and
it
was
believed
says
the
historian
that
the
spirit
had
also
appeared
to
him
as
if
to
supply
in
his
mind
the
want
of
legal
evidence
this
case
is
certainly
a
solemn
illustration
of
the
of
justice
in
an
ancient
court
yet
the
circumstantial
evidence
arising
from
the
appearance
of
the
spirit
appears
very
strong
the
finding
of
the
body
and
the
boots
and
stockings
yet
we
need
perhaps
to
live
more
immediately
within
the
circle
of
the
circumstance
to
pronounce
upon
it
none
of
us
however
reading
this
book
would
like
to
take
upon
ourselves
the
responsibility
of
those
daring
jurymen
who
durst
venture
to
throw
away
life
upon
evidence
which
strong
as
it
appears
to
have
been
did
not
come
to
them
but
only
to
one
who
had
borne
witness
to
them

henderson
folk
lore
one
evening
between
the
years
and
a
traveller
dressed
in
woman
clothes
arrived
at
the
old
spital
inn
the
place
where
the
mail
coach
changed
horses
in
high
spital
on
bowes
moor
the
traveller
begged
to
stay
all
night
but
had
to
go
away
so
early
in
the
morning
that
if
a
mouthful
of
food
were
set
ready
for
breakfast
there
was
no
need
the
family
should
be
disturbed
by
her
departure
the
people
of
the
house
however
arranged
that
a
servant
maid
should
sit
up
till
the
stranger
was
out
of
the
premises
and
then
went
to
bed
themselves
the
girl
lay
down
for
a
nap
on
the
longsettle
by
the
fire
but
before
she
shut
her
eyes
she
took
a
good
look
at
the
traveller
who
was
sitting
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
hearth
and
espied
a
pair
of
man
trousers
peeping
out
from
under
the
gown
all
inclination
for
sleep
was
now
gone
however
with
great
she
feigned
it
closed
her
eyes
and
even
began
to
snore
on
this
the
traveller
got
up
pulled
out
of
his
pocket
a
dead
man
hand
fitted
a
candle
to
it
lighted
the
candle
and
passed
hand
and
candle
several
times
before
the
servant
girl
face
saying
as
he
did
so
let
those
who
are
asleep
be
asleep
and
let
those
who
are
awake
be
awake
this
done
he
placed
the
light
on
the
table
opened
the
outer
door
went
down
two
or
three
of
the
steps
which
led
from
the
house
to
the
road
and
began
to
whistle
for
his
companions
the
girl
who
had
hitherto
had
presence
of
mind
enough
to
remain
perfectly
quiet
now
jumped
up
rushed
behind
the
ruffian
and
pushed
him
down
the
steps
she
then
shut
the
door
locked
it
and
ran
upstairs
to
try
and
wake
the
family
but
without
success
calling
shouting
and
shaking
were
alike
in
vain
the
poor
girl
was
in
despair
for
she
heard
the
traveller
and
his
comrades
outside
the
house
so
she
ran
down
again
seized
a
bowl
of
blue
skimmed
milk
and
threw
it
over
the
hand
and
candle
after
which
she
went
upstairs
again
and
awoke
the
sleepers
without
any
difficulty
the
landlord
son
went
to
the
window
and
asked
the
men
outside
what
they
wanted
they
answered
that
if
the
dead
hand
were
but
given
them
they
would
go
away
quietly
and
do
no
harm
to
anyone
this
he
refused
and
fired
among
them
and
the
shot
must
have
taken
effect
for
in
the
morning
stains
of
blood
were
traced
to
a
considerable
distance
these
circumstances
were
related
to
my
informant
mr
charles
wastell
in
the
spring
of
by
an
old
woman
named
bella
parkin
who
resided
close
to
high
spital
and
was
actually
the
daughter
of
the
courageous
it
is
interesting
to
compare
them
with
the
following
narrations
communicated
to
me
by
the
rev
baring
gould
two
magicians
having
come
to
lodge
in
a
with
a
view
to
robbing
it
asked
permission
to
pass
the
night
by
the
fire
and
obtained
it
when
the
house
was
quiet
the
suspecting
mischief
crept
downstairs
and
looked
through
the
keyhole
she
saw
the
men
open
a
sack
and
take
out
a
dry
withered
hand
they
anointed
the
fingers
with
some
unguent
and
lighted
them
each
finger
flamed
but
the
thumb
they
could
not
light
that
was
because
one
of
the
household
was
not
asleep
the
girl
hastened
to
her
master
but
found
it
impossible
to
arouse
him
she
tried
every
other
sleeper
but
could
not
break
the
charmed
sleep
at
last
stealing
down
into
the
kitchen
while
the
thieves
were
busy
over
her
master
strong
box
she
secured
the
hand
blew
out
the
flames
and
at
once
the
whole
household
was
aroused
but
the
next
story
bears
a
closer
resemblance
to
the
stainmore
narrative
one
dark
night
when
all
was
shut
up
there
came
a
tap
at
the
door
of
a
lone
inn
in
the
middle
of
a
barren
moor
the
door
was
opened
and
there
stood
without
shivering
and
shaking
a
poor
beggar
his
rags
soaked
with
rain
and
his
hands
white
with
cold
he
asked
piteously
for
a
lodging
and
it
was
cheerfully
granted
him
there
was
not
a
spare
bed
in
the
house
but
he
could
lie
on
the
mat
before
the
kitchen
fire
and
welcome
so
this
was
settled
and
everyone
in
the
house
went
to
bed
except
the
cook
who
from
the
back
kitchen
could
see
into
the
large
room
through
a
pane
of
glass
let
into
the
door
she
watched
the
beggar
and
saw
him
as
soon
as
he
was
left
alone
draw
himself
up
from
the
floor
seat
himself
at
the
table
extract
from
his
pocket
a
brown
withered
human
hand
and
set
it
upright
in
the
candlestick
he
then
anointed
the
fingers
and
applying
a
match
to
them
they
began
to
flame
filled
with
horror
the
cook
rushed
up
the
back
stairs
and
endeavoured
to
arouse
her
master
and
the
men
of
the
house
but
all
was
in
vain
they
slept
a
charmed
sleep
so
in
despair
she
hastened
down
again
and
placed
herself
at
her
post
of
observation
she
saw
the
fingers
of
the
hand
flaming
but
the
thumb
remained
unlighted
because
one
inmate
of
the
house
was
awake
the
beggar
was
busy
collecting
the
valuables
around
him
into
a
large
sack
and
having
taken
all
he
cared
for
in
the
large
room
he
entered
another
on
this
the
woman
ran
in
and
seizing
the
light
tried
to
extinguish
the
flames
but
this
was
not
so
easy
she
blew
at
them
but
they
burnt
on
as
before
she
poured
the
dregs
of
a
over
them
but
they
blazed
up
the
brighter
as
a
last
resource
she
caught
up
a
jug
of
milk
and
dashed
it
over
the
four
lambent
flames
and
they
died
out
at
once
uttering
a
loud
cry
she
rushed
to
the
door
of
the
apartment
the
beggar
had
entered
and
locked
it
the
whole
family
was
aroused
and
the
thief
easily
secured
and
hanged
this
tale
is
told
in
northumberland

local

on
the
threshold
of

of

doors
of

there
is
a
bloody
footstep
impressed
into
the
and
ruddy
as
if
the
bloody
foot
had
just
trodden
there
and
it
is
averred
that
on
a
certain
night
of
the
year
and
at
a
certain
hour
of
the
night
if
you
go
and
look
at
the
you
will
see
the
mark
wet
with
fresh
blood
some
have
pretended
to
say
that
this
appearance
of
blood
was
but
dew
but
can
dew
redden
a
cambric
handkerchief
will

crimson
the
when

touch

and
that
is
what
the
bloody
footstep
will
surely
do
when
the
appointed
night
and
hour
come
round
it
is
needless
to
tell
you
all
the
strange
stories
that
have
survived
to
this
day
about
the
old
hall
and
how
it
is
believed
that
the
master
of
it
owing
to
his
ancient
science
has
still
a
sort
of
residence
there
and
control
of
the
place
and
how
in
one
of
the
chambers
there
is
still
his
antique
table
and
his
chair
and
some
rude
old
instruments
and
machinery
and
a
book
and
everything
in
readiness
just
as
if
he
might
still
come
back
to
finish
some
experiment
one
of
the
chief
things
to
which
the
old
lord
applied
himself
was
to
discover
the
means
of
prolonging
his
own
life
so
that
its
duration
should
be
indefinite
if
not
infinite
and
such
was
his
science
that
he
was
believed
to
have
attained
this
magnificent
and
awful
purpose
the
object
of
the
lord
of
smithills
hall
was
to
take
a
life
from
the
course
of
nature
and
nature
did
not
choose
to
be
defrauded
so
that
great
as
was
the
power
of
this
scientific
man
over
her
she
would
not
consent
that
he
should
escape
the
necessity
of
dying
at
his
proper
time
except
upon
condition
of
sacrificing
some
other
life
for
his
and
this
was
to
be
done
once
for
every
thirty
years
that
he
chose
to
live
thirty
years
being
the
account
of
a
generation
of
man
and
if
in
any
way
in
that
time
this
lord
could
be
the
death
of
a
human
being
that
satisfied
the
requisition
and
he
might
live
on
there
was
but
one
human
being
whom
he
cared
for
that
was
a
beautiful
kinswoman
an
orphan
whom
his
father
had
brought
up
and
dying
left
to
his
care
he
saw
that
she
if
anyone
was
to
be
the
person
whom
the
sacrifice
demanded
and
that
he
might
kill
twenty
others
without
effect
but
if
he
took
the
life
of
this
one
it
would
make
the
charm
strong
and
good
he
did
slay
this
pure
young
girl
he
took
her
into
the
wood
near
the
house
an
old
wood
that
is
standing
yet
with
some
of
its
magnificent
oaks
and
there
he
plunged
a
dagger
into
her
heart
he
buried
her
in
the
wood
and
returned
to
the
house
and
as
it
happened
he
had
set
his
right
foot
in
her
blood
and
his
shoe
was
wet
in
it
and
by
some
miraculous
fate
it
left
a
track
all
along
the
and
into
the
house
and
on
the
stone
steps
of
the
threshold
and
up
into
his
chamber
the
servants
saw
it
the
next
day
and
wondered
and
whispered
and
missed
the
fair
young
girl
and
looked
askance
at
their
lord
right
foot
and
turned
pale
all
of
them
next
the
legend
says
that
sir
forrester
was
struck
with
horror
at
what
he
had
done
and
fled
from
his
old
hall
and
was
gone
full
many
a
day
but
all
the
while
he
was
gone
there
was
the
mark
of
a
bloody
footstep
impressed
upon
the
stone
of
the
hall
the
legend
says
that
wherever
sir
forrester
went
in
his
wanderings
about
the
world
he
left
a
bloody
track
behind
him
once
he
went
to
the
court
and
there
being
a
track
up
to
the
very
throne
the
king
frowned
upon
him
so
that
he
never
came
there
any
more
nobody
could
tell
how
it
happened
his
foot
was
not
seen
to
bleed
only
there
was
the
bloody
track
behind
him
at
last
this
unfortunate
lord
deemed
it
best
to
go
back
to
his
own
hall
where
living
among
faithful
old
servants
born
in
the
family
he
could
hush
the
matter
up
better
than
elsewhere
so
home
he
came
and
there
he
saw
the
bloody
track
on
the
and
dolefully
went
into
the
hall
and
up
the
stairs
an
old
servant
ushering
him
into
his
chamber
and
half
a
dozen
others
following
him
behind
gazing
shuddering
pointing
with
quivering
fingers
looking
in
one
another
pale
faces
by
and
by
he
vanished
from
the
old
hall
but
not
by
death
for
from
generation
to
generation
they
say
that
a
bloody
track
is
seen
around
that
house
and
sometimes
it
is
traced
up
into
the
chambers
so
fresh
that
you
see
he
must
have
passed
a
short
time
before
this
is
the
legend
of
the
bloody
footstep
which
i
myself
have
seen
at
the
hall
door
li
the
ghostly
warriors
of
worms
the
phantom
world
the
abbot
of
ursperg
in
his
chronicle
year
says
that
in
the
territory
of
worms
they
saw
during
many
days
a
multitude
of
armed
men
on
foot
and
on
horseback
going
and
coming
with
great
noise
like
people
who
are
going
to
a
solemn
assembly
every
day
they
marched
towards
the
hour
of
noon
to
a
mountain
which
appeared
to
be
their
place
of
rendezvous
someone
in
the
neighbourhood
bolder
than
the
rest
having
guarded
himself
with
the
sign
of
the
cross
approached
one
of
these
armed
men
conjuring
him
in
the
name
of
god
to
declare
the
meaning
of
this
army
and
their
design
the
soldier
or
phantom
replied
we
are
not
what
you
imagine
we
are
neither
vain
phantoms
nor
true
soldiers
we
are
the
spirits
of
those
who
were
killed
on
this
spot
a
long
time
ago
the
arms
and
horses
which
you
behold
are
the
instruments
of
our
punishment
as
they
were
of
our
sins
we
are
all
on
fire
though
you
can
see
nothing
about
us
which
appears
inflamed
it
is
said
that
they
remarked
in
this
company
the
count
emico
who
had
been
killed
a
few
years
before
and

boldly
cried
out
all
very
fine
mr

you
ca
lodge
here

it
was
decidedly
the
worst
thing
he
ever
did
in

corn
went
down
i
am
afraid
to
say
how
much
per
quarter
if
on
the
contrary
you
treat
him
well
and
refrain
from
indelicate
inquiries
respecting
his
age
on
which
point
he
is
very
touchy
his
visit
is
sure
to
bring
good
luck
perhaps
years
afterwards
when
you
are
on
your
he
may
happen
to
be
passing
and
if
he
you
are
safe
for
three
knocks
with

will
make
you
hale

he
never
forgets
any
kindnesses
many
stories
are
current
of
his
wonderful
cures
but
there
is
one
to
be
found
in
peck
of
which
possesses
the
rare
merit
of
being
written
by
the
patient
himself
upon
whitsunday
in
the
year
of
our
lord
about
six
of
the
clock
just
after
evensong
one
samuel
wallis
of
stamford
who
had
been
long
wasted
with
a
lingering
consumption
was
sitting
by
the
fire
reading
in
that
delectable
book
called

for
he
heard
a
knock
at
the
door
and
as
his
nurse
was
absent
he
crawled
to
open
it
himself
what
he
saw
there
samuel
shall
say
in
his
own
style
i
beheld
a
proper
tall
grave
old
man
thus
he
said
i
pray
thee
give
an
old
pilgrim
a
cup
of
small
beere
and
i
said
i
pray

the

for

they
appeared
diverse
ways
but
their
most
frequent
way
of
appearing
was
like
with
musick
or
in
the
form
of
funerals
when
they
appeared
like
they
were
desirous
to
entice
persons
into
their
company
and
some
were
drawn
among
them
and
remained
among
them
some
time
usually
a
whole
year
as
did
edmund
william
rees
a
man
whom
i
well
knew
and
was
a
neighbour
who
came
back
at
the
end
and
looked
very
bad
but
either
they
were
not
able
to
give
much
account
of
themselves
or
they
durst
not
give
it
only
said
they
had
been
dancing
and
that
the
time
was
short
but
there
were
some
others
who
went
with
them
at
night
and
returned
sometimes
at
night
and
sometimes
the
next
morning
especially
those
persons
who
took
upon
them
to
cure
the
hurts
received
from
the
fairies
as
charles

of
coed
yr
pame
in
langybi
parish
and
rissiart
cap
dee
of
aberystruth
for
the
former
of
these
must
certainly
converse
with
them
for
how
else
could
he
declare
the
words
which
his
visitors
had
spoken
a
day
or
days
before
they
came
to
him
to
their
great
surprise
and
wonder
and
as
for
rissiart
cap
dee
so
called
because
he
wore
a
black
cap
it
is
said
of
him
that
when
he
lodged
in
some
houses
to
cure
those
who
were
hurt
by
the
fairies
he
would
suddenly
rise
up
in
the
night
and
make
a
very
hasty
preparation
to
go
downstairs
which
when
one
person
observ
he
said
go
softly
uncle
richard
least
you
fall
he
made
answer
o
here
are
some
to
receive
me
but
when
he
was
called
to
one
person
who
had
inadvertently
fallen
among
the
fairies
and
had
been
greatly
hurt
by
them
and
kept
his
bed
upon
it
whose
relations
had
sent
for
the
said
rissiart
cap
dee
to
cure
him
who
when
he
came
up
to
the
sick
man
chamber
the
sick
man
took
up
a
stone
which
was
by
the
and
threw
it
at
the
infernal
charmer
with
all
his
might
saying
thou
old
villain
wast
one
of
the
worst
of
them
to
hurt
me
for
he
had
seen
him
among
them
acting
his
part
against
him
upon
which
the
old
charmer
went
away
muttering
some
words
of
malevolence
against
him
he
lived
at
the
foot
of
rhyw
coelbren
and
there
was
a
large
hole
in
the
side
of
the
thatch
of
his
house
thro
which
the
people
believed
he
went
out
at
night
to
the
fairies
and
came
in
from
them
at
night
but
he
pretended
it
was
that
he
might
see
the
stars
at
night
the
house
is
down
long
ago
he
lived
by
himself
as
did
the
charles
hugh
who
was
very
famous
in
the
county
for
his
cures
and
knowledge
of
things
at
a
distance
which
he
could
not
possibly
know
without
conversing
with
evil
spirits
who
walked
the
earth
to
and
fro
he
is
yet
said
to
be
an
affable
friendly
man
and
cheerful
then
a
pity
he
should
be
in
alliance
with
hell
and
an
agent
in
the
kingdom
of
darkness
i
will
only
give
one
instance
of
his
knowledge
of
things
at
a
distance
and
of
secret
things
henry
john
thomas
of
the
parish
of
aberystruth
a
relation
of
mine
an
honest
man
went
with
the
water
of
a
young
woman
whom
he
courted
and
was
sick
to
the
said
charles
hugh
who
as
soon
as
he
saw
henry
john
pleasantly
told
him
ho
you
come
with
your
sweetheart
water
to
me
and
he
told
him
the
very
words
which
they
had
spoken
together
in
a
secret
place
and
described
the
place
where
they
spoke
it
was
the
general
opinion
in
times
past
when
these
things
were
very
frequent
that
the
fairies
knew
whatever
was
spoken
in
the
air
without
the
houses
not
so
much
what
was
spoken
in
the
houses
i
suppose
they
chiefly
knew
what
was
spoken
in
the
air
at
night
it
was
also
said
they
rather
appeared
to
an
uneven
number
of
persons
to
one
three
five
and
oftener
to
men
than
to
women
thomas
william
edmund
of
havodavel
an
honest
pious
man
who
often
saw
them
declared
that
they
appeared
with
one
bigger
than
the
rest
going
before
them
in
the
company
but
they
very
often
appeared
in
the
form
of
a
funeral
before
the
death
of
many
persons
with
a
bier
and
a
black
cloth
in
the
midst
of
a
company
about
it
on
every
side
before
and
after
it
the
instances
of
this
were
so
numerous
that
it
is
plain
and
past
all
dispute
that
they
infallibly
foreknew
the
time
of
men
death
the
difficulty
is
whence
they
had
this
knowledge
it
can
not
be
supposed
that
either
god
himself
or
his
angels
discovered
this
to
these
spirits
of
darkness
for
secrets
of
the
lord
are

that
fear
not
with

they
must
therefore
have
this
knowledge
from
the
position
of
the
stars
at
the
time
of
birth

their
influence
which
they
perfectly
understand
beyond

have
a
constant

this

the

of
appin
campbell
tales
of
the
west
highlands
once
upon
a
time
there
lived
a
man
at
appin
argyllshire
and
he
took
to
his
house
an
orphan
boy
when
the
boy
was
grown
up
he
was
sent
to
herd
and
upon
a
day
of
days
and
him
herding
there
came
a
fine
gentleman
where
he
was
who
asked
him
to
become
his
servant
and
that
he
would
give
him
plenty
to
eat
and
drink
clothes
and
great
wages
the
boy
told
him
that
he
would
like
very
much
to
get
a
good
suit
of
clothes
but
that
he
would
not
engage
till
he
would
see
his
master
but
the
fine
gentleman
would
have
him
engaged
without
any
delay
this
the
boy
would
not
do
upon
any
terms
till
he
would
see
his
master
well
says
the
gentleman
in
the
meantime
write
your
name
in
this
book
saying
this
he
puts
his
hand
into
his
oxter
pocket
and
pulling
out
a
large
red
book
he
told
the
boy
to
write
his
name
in
the
book
this
the
boy
would
not
do
neither
would
he
tell
his
name
till
he
would
acquaint
his
master
first
now
says
the
gentleman
since
you
will
neither
engage
or
tell
your
name
till
you
see
your
present
master
be
sure
to
meet
me
about
sunset
at
a
certain
place
the
boy
promised
that
he
would
be
sure
to
meet
him
at
the
place
about
sunsetting
when
the
boy
came
home
he
told
his
master
what
the
gentleman
said
to
him
poor
boy
says
he
a
fine
master
he
would
make
lucky
for
you
that
you
neither
engaged
nor
wrote
your
name
in
his
book
but
since
you
promised
to
meet
him
you
must
go
but
as
you
value
your
life
do
as
i
tell
you
his
master
gave
him
a
sword
and
at
the
same
time
he
told
him
to
be
sure
to
be
at
the
place
mentioned
a
while
before
sunset
and
to
draw
a
circle
round
himself
with
the
point
of
the
sword
in
the
name
of
trinity
when
you
do
this
draw
a
cross
in
the
centre
of
the
circle
upon
which
you
will
stand
yourself
and
do
not
move
out
of
that
position
till
the
rising
of
the
sun
next
morning
he
also
told
him
that
he
would
wish
him
to
come
out
of
the
circle
to
put
his
name
in
the
book
but
that
upon
no
account
he
was
to
leave
the
circle
but
ask
the
book
till
you
would
write
your
name
yourself
and
when
once
you
get
hold
of
the
book
keep
it
he
can
not
touch
a
hair
of
your
head
if
you
keep
inside
the
circle
so
the
boy
was
at
the
place
long
before
the
gentleman
made
his
appearance
but
sure
enough
he
came
after
sunset
he
tried
all
his
arts
to
get
the
boy
outside
the
circle
to
sign
his
name
in
the
red
book
but
the
boy
would
not
move
one
foot
out
from
where
he
stood
but
at
the
long
last
he
handed
the
book
to
the
boy
so
as
to
write
his
name
therein
the
book
was
no
sooner
inside
the
circle
than
it
fell
out
of
the
gentleman
hand
inside
the
circle
the
boy
cautiously
stretched
out
his
hand
for
the
book
and
as
soon
as
he
got
hold
of
it
he
put
it
in
his
oxter
when
the
fine
gentleman
saw
that
he
did
not
mean
to
give
him
back
the
book
he
got
furious
and
at
last
he
transformed
himself
into
great
many
likenesses
blowing
fire
and
brimstone
out
of
his
mouth
and
nostrils
at
times
he
would
appear
as
a
horse
other
times
a
huge
cat
and
a
fearful
beast
uille
bbeast
he
was
going
round
the
circle
the
length
of
the
night
when
day
was
beginning
to
break
he
let
out
one
fearful
screech
he
put
himself
in
the
shape
of
a
large
raven
and
he
was
soon
out
of
the
boy
sight
the
boy
still
remained
where
he
was
till
he
saw
the
sun
in
the
morning
which
no
sooner
he
observed
than
he
took
to
his
soles
home
as
fast
as
he
could
he
gave
the
book
to
his
master
and
this
is
how
the
red
book
of
appin
was
got

a
prophetic
relation
of
the
events
which
were
to
happen
in
ages
yet
to
come
his
auditors
listened
now
rapt
in
wonder
now
fired
with
indignation
burning
with
shame
or
melted
into
sorrow
as
he
faithfully
detailed
the
heroism
the
injuries
the
crimes
and
the
miseries
of
their
descendants
in
the
midst
of
his
predictions
he
rose
slowly
from
his
seat
advanced
with
a
solemn
measured
and
majestic
tread
to
the
shore
of
the
lake
and
walked
forward
composedly
upon
its
unyielding
surface
when
he
had
nearly
reached
the
centre
he
paused
for
a
moment
then
turning
slowly
round
looked
toward
his
friends
and
waving
his
arms
to
them
with
the
cheerful
air
of
one
taking
a
short
farewell
disappeared
from
their
view
the
memory
of
the
good
has
been
cherished
by
successive
generations
with
affectionate
reverence
and
it
is
believed
that
at
sunrise
on
every
morning
the
anniversary
of
his
departure
he
revisits
his
ancient
domains
a
favoured
few
only
are
in
general
permitted
to
see
him
and
this
distinction
is
always
an
omen
of
good
fortune
to
the
beholders
when
it
is
granted
to
many
it
is
a
sure
token
of
an
abundant
harvest
a
blessing
the
want
of
which
during
this
prince
reign
was
never
felt
by
his
people
some
years
have
elapsed
since
the
last
appearance
of
the
april
of
that
year
had
been
remarkably
wild
and
stormy
but
on
the
fury
of
the
elements
had
altogether
subsided
the
air
was
hushed
and
still
and
the
sky
which
was
reflected
in
the
serene
lake
resembled
a
beautiful
but
deceitful
countenance
whose
smiles
after
the
most
tempestuous
emotions
tempt
the
stranger
to
believe
that
it
belongs
to
a
soul
which
no
passion
has
ever
ruffled
the
first
beams
of
the
rising
sun
were
just
gilding
the
lofty
summit
of
glenaa
when
the
waters
near
the
eastern
shore
of
the
lake
became
suddenly
and
violently
agitated
though
all
the
rest
of
its
surface
lay
smooth
and
still
as
a
tomb
of
polished
marble
the
next
morning
a
foaming
wave
darted
forward
and
like
a
proud
exulting
in
his
strength
rushed
across
the
lake
toward
toomies
mountain
behind
this
wave
appeared
a
stately
warrior
fully
armed
mounted
upon
a
steed
his
snowy
plume
waved
gracefully
from
a
helmet
of
polished
steel
and
at
his
back
fluttered
a
light
blue
scarf
the
horse
apparently
exulting
in
his
noble
burden
sprung
after
the
wave
along
the
water
which
bore
him
up
like
firm
earth
while
showers
of
spray
that
glittered
brightly
in
the
morning
sun
were
dashed
up
at
every
bound
the
warrior
was
he
was
followed
by
numberless
youths
and
maidens
who
moved
lightly
and
unconstrained
over
the
watery
plain
as
the
moonlight
fairies
glide
through
the
fields
of
air
they
were
linked
together
by
garlands
of
delicious
spring
flowers
and
they
timed
their
movements
to
strains
of
enchanting
melody
when
had
nearly
reached
the
western
side
of
the
lake
he
suddenly
turned
his
steed
and
directed
his
course
along
the
shore
of
glenaa
preceded
by
the
huge
wave
that
curled
and
foamed
up
as
high
as
the
horse
neck
whose
fiery
nostrils
snorted
above
it
the
long
train
of
attendants
followed
with
playful
deviations
the
track
of
their
leader
and
moved
on
with
unabated
fleetness
to
their
celestial
music
till
gradually
as
they
entered
the
narrow
strait
between
glenaa
and
dinis
they
became
involved
in
the
mists
which
still
partially
floated
over
the
lake
and
faded
from
the
view
of
the
wondering
beholders
but
the
sound
of
their
music
still
fell
upon
the
ear
and
echo
catching
up
the
harmonious
strains
fondly
repeated
and
prolonged
them
in
soft
and
softer
tones
till
the
last
faint
repetition
died
away
and
the
hearers
awoke
as
from
a
dream
of
bliss
lvi
sarah
polgrain
by
william
hunt
a
woman
who
had
lived
in
ludgvan
was
executed
at
bodmin
for
the
murder
of
her
husband
there
was
but
little
doubt
that
she
had
been
urged
on
to
the
diabolical
deed
by
a
known
as
yorkshire
jack
with
whom
for
a
long
period
she
was
generally
supposed
to
have
been
criminally
acquainted
now
it
will
be
remembered
that
this
really
happened
within
the
present
century
one
morning
during
my
residence
in
penzance
an
old
woman
from
ludgvan
called
on
me
with
some
trifling
message
while
she
was
waiting
for
my
answer
i
made
some
ordinary
remark
about
the
weather
it
all
owing
to
sarah
polgrain
said
she
sarah
polgrain
said
i
and
who
is
sarah
polgrain
then
the
voluble
old
lady
told
me
the
whole
story
of
the
poisoning
with
which
we
need
not
at
present
concern
ourselves
by
and
by
the
tale
grew
especially
interesting
and
there
i
resume
it
sarah
had
begged
that
yorkshire
jack
might
accompany
her
to
the
scaffold
when
she
was
led
forth
to
execution
this
was
granted
and
on
the
dreadful
morning
there
stood
this
unholy
pair
the
fatal
beam
on
which
the
woman
body
was
in
a
few
minutes
to
swing
before
them
they
kissed
each
other
and
whispered
words
passed
between
them
the
executioner
intimated
that
the
moment
of
execution
had
arrived
and
that
they
must
part
sarah
polgrain
looking
earnestly
into
the
eyes
said
you
will
yorkshire
jack
replied
i
will
and
they
separated
the
man
retired
amongst
the
crowd
the
woman
was
soon
a
dead
corpse
pendulating
in
the
wind
years
passed
on
yorkshire
jack
was
never
the
same
man
as
before
his
whole
bearing
was
altered
his
bold
his
dashing
air
deserted
him
he
walked
or
rather
wandered
slowly
about
the
streets
of
the
town
or
the
lanes
of
the
country
he
constantly
moved
his
head
from
side
to
side
looking
first
over
one
and
then
over
the
other
shoulder
as
though
dreading
that
someone
was
following
him
the
stout
man
became
thin
his
ruddy
cheeks
more
pale
and
his
eyes
sunken
at
length
he
disappeared
and
it
was
discovered
for
yorkshire
jack
had
made
a
confidant
of
some
ludgvan
man
that
he
had
pledged
himself
living
or
dead
to
become
the
husband
of
sarah
polgrain
after
the
lapse
of
years
to
escape
if
possible
from
himself
jack
had
gone
to
sea
in
the
merchant
service
well
the
period
had
arrived
when
this
unholy
promise
was
to
be
fulfilled
yorkshire
jack
was
returning
from
the
mediterranean
in
a
he
was
met
by
the
devil
and
sarah
polgrain
far
out
at
sea
off
the
land
end
jack
would
not
accompany
them
willingly
so
they
followed
the
ship
for
days
during
all
which
time
she
was
involved
in
a
storm
eventually
jack
was
washed
from
the
deck
by
such
a
wave
as
the
oldest
sailor
had
never
seen
and
presently
amidst
loud
thunders
and
flashing
lightnings
riding
as
it
were
in
a
black
cloud
three
figures
were
seen
passing
onward
these
were
the
devil
sarah
polgrain
and
yorkshire
jack
and
this
was
the
cause
of
the
storm
it
is
all
true
as
you
may
learn
if
you
will
inquire
said
the
old
woman

many
of
her
kin

godwin
lives
of
the
necromancers
this
was
a
period
in
which
the
ideas
of
witchcraft
had
caught
fast
hold
of
the
minds
of
mankind
and
those
accusations
which
by
the
enlightened
part
of
the
species
would
now
be
regarded
as
worthy
only
of
contempt
were
then
considered
as
charges
of
the
most
flagitious
nature
while
john
duke
of
bedford
the
eldest
uncle
of
king
henry
was
regent
of
france
humphrey
of
gloucester
next
brother
to
bedford
was
lord
protector
of
the
realm
of
england
though
henry
was
now
nineteen
years
of
age
yet
as
he
was
a
prince
of
slender
capacity
humphrey
still
continued
to
discharge
the
functions
of
sovereignty
he
was
eminently
endowed
with
popular
qualities
and
was
a
favourite
with
the
majority
of
the
nation
he
had
however
many
enemies
one
of
the
chief
of
whom
was
henry
beaufort
to
the
king
and
cardinal
of
winchester
one
of
the
means
employed
by
this
prelate
to
undermine
the
power
of
humphrey
consisted
in
a
charge
of
witchcraft
brought
against
eleanor
cobham
his
wife
this
woman
had
probably
yielded
to
the
delusions
which
artful
persons
who
saw
into
the
weakness
of
her
character
sought
to
practise
upon
her
she
was
the
second
wife
of
humphrey
and
he
was
suspected
to
have
indulged
in
undue
familiarity
with
her
before
he
was
a
widower
his
present
duchess
was
reported
to
have
had
recourse
to
witchcraft
in
the
first
instance
by
way
of
securing
his
wayward
inclinations
the
duke
of
bedford
had
died
in
and
humphrey
now
in
addition
to
the
actual
exercise
of
the
powers
of
sovereignty
was
next
heir
to
the
crown
in
case
of
the
king
decease
this
weak
and
licentious
woman
being
now
duchess
of
gloucester
and
wife
to
the
lord
protector
directed
her
ambition
to
the
higher
title
and
prerogatives
of
a
queen

by
way
of
feeding
her
evil
passions
called
to
her
counsels

one
john
hume

hun
a
priest
these
persons
frequently
met
the
duchess
in
secret
cabal
they
were
accused
of
calling
up
spirits
from
the
infernal
world
and
they
made
an
image
of
wax
which
they
slowly
consumed
before
a
fire
expecting
that
as
the
image
gradually
wasted
away
so
the
constitution
and
life
of
the
poor
king
would
decay
and
finally
perish
hume
or
hun
is
supposed
to
have
turned
informer
and
upon
his
information
several
of
these
persons
were
taken
into

the

sanctuary
at
