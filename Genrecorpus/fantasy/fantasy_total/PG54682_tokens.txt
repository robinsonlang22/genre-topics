introduction
it
is
instructive
to
compare
superstition
with
science
mythology
is
the
term
used
to
designate
the
superstitions
of
the
ancients
is
the
term
used
to
designate
the
superstitions
of
the
ignorant
of
today
ancient
mythology
has
been
carefully
studied
by
modern
thinkers
for
purposes
of
trope
and
simile
in
the
embellishment
of
literature
and
especially
of
poetry
then
it
has
been
investigated
for
the
purpose
of
discovering
its
meaning
in
the
hope
that
some
occult
significance
might
be
found
on
the
theory
that
the
wisdom
of
the
ancients
was
far
superior
to
that
of
modern
men
now
science
has
entered
this
field
of
study
to
compare
one
mythology
with
another
and
to
compare
mythology
with
science
itself
for
the
purpose
of
discovering
stages
of
human
opinion
when
the
mythology
of
tribal
men
came
to
be
studied
it
was
found
that
their
philosophy
was
also
a
mythology
in
which
the
mysteries
of
the
universe
were
explained
in
a
collection
of
tales
told
by
wise
men
prophets
and
priests
this
lore
of
the
wise
among
savage
men
is
of
the
same
origin
and
has
the
same
significance
as
the
lore
of
hesiod
and
homer
it
is
thus
a
mythology
in
the
early
sense
of
that
term
but
the
mythology
of
tribal
men
is
devoid
of
that
glamour
and
witchery
born
of
poetry
hence
it
seems
rude
and
savage
in
comparison
for
example
with
the
mythology
of
the
and
to
rank
no
higher
as
philosophic
thought
than
the
tales
of
the
ignorant
and
superstitious
which
are
called
and
gradually
such
mythology
has
come
to
be
called
is
a
discredited
mythology
a
mythology
once
held
as
a
philosophy
nowadays
the
tales
of
savage
men
not
being
credited
by
civilized
and
enlightened
men
with
that
wisdom
which
is
held
to
belong
to
philosophy
are
called
or
sometimes
the
collected
by
cushing
constitute
a
charming
exhibit
of
the
wisdom
of
the
zuñis
as
they
believe
though
it
may
be
but
a
charming
exhibit
of
the
follies
of
the
zuñis
as
we
believe
the
wisdom
of
one
age
is
the
folly
of
the
next
and
the
opinions
of
tribal
men
seem
childish
to
civilized
men
then
why
should
we
seek
to
discover
their
thoughts
science
in
seeking
to
know
the
truth
about
the
universe
does
not
expect
to
find
it
in
mythology
or
does
not
even
consider
it
as
a
paramount
end
that
it
should
be
used
as
an
embellishment
of
literature
though
it
serves
this
purpose
well
modern
science
now
considers
it
of
profound
importance
to
know
the
course
of
the
evolution
of
the
humanities
that
is
the
evolution
of
pleasures
the
evolution
of
industries
the
evolution
of
institutions
the
evolution
of
languages
and
finally
the
evolution
of
opinions
how
opinions
grow
seems
to
be
one
of
the
most
instructive
chapters
in
the
science
of
psychology
psychologists
do
not
go
to
the
past
to
find
valid
opinions
but
to
find
stages
of
development
in
opinions
hence
mythology
or
is
of
profound
interest
and
supreme
importance
under
the
scriptorial
wand
of
cushing
the
of
the
zuñis
are
destined
to
become
a
part
of
the
living
literature
of
the
world
for
he
is
a
poet
although
he
does
not
write
in
verse
cushing
can
think
as
think
he
can
speak
as
prophets
speak
he
can
expound
as
priests
expound
and
his
tales
have
the
verisimilitude
of
ancient
lore
but
his
sympathy
with
the
mythology
of
tribal
men
does
not
veil
the
realities
of
science
from
his
mind
the
gods
of
zuñi
like
those
of
all
primitive
people
are
the
ancients
of
animals
but
we
must
understand
and
heartily
appreciate
their
simple
thought
if
we
would
do
them
justice
all
entities
are
animals
men
brutes
plants
stars
lands
waters
and
rocks
and
all
have
souls
the
souls
are
tenuous
existences
mist
entities
gaseous
creatures
inhabiting
firmer
bodies
of
matter
they
are
ghosts
that
own
bodies
they
can
leave
their
bodies
or
if
they
discover
bodies
that
have
been
vacated
they
can
take
possession
of
them
force
and
mind
belong
to
souls
fixed
form
firm
existence
belong
to
matter
while
bodies
and
souls
constitute
the
world
the
world
is
a
universe
of
animals
the
stars
are
animals
compelled
to
travel
around
the
world
by
magic
the
plants
are
animals
under
a
spell
of
enchantment
so
that
usually
they
can
not
travel
the
waters
are
animals
sometimes
under
the
spell
of
enchantment
lakes
writhe
in
waves
the
sea
travels
in
circles
about
the
earth
and
the
streams
run
over
the
lands
mountains
and
hills
tremble
in
pain
but
can
not
wander
about
but
rocks
and
hills
and
mountains
sometimes
travel
about
by
night
these
animals
of
the
world
come
in
a
flood
of
generations
and
the
are
gods
and
are
usually
called
the
ancients
or
the
first
ones
the
generations
are
descendants
of
the
gods
but
alas
they
are
degenerate
sons
the
theatre
of
the
world
is
the
theatre
of
necromancy
and
the
gods
are
the
primeval
the
gods
still
live
but
their
descendants
often
die
death
itself
is
the
result
of
necromancy
practiced
by
bad
men
or
angry
gods
in
every
amerindian
language
there
is
a
term
to
express
this
magical
power
among
the
iroquoian
tribes
it
is
called
among
the
siouan
tribe
some
manifestations
of
it
are
called
or
but
the
generic
term
in
this
language
is
among
the
shoshonean
tribes
it
is
called
let
us
borrow
one
of
these
terms
and
call
it
all
unexplained
phenomena
are
attributed
to
orenda
thus
the
venom
of
the
serpent
is
orenda
and
this
orenda
can
pass
from
a
serpent
to
an
arrow
by
another
exercise
of
orenda
and
hence
the
arrow
is
charmed
the
rattlesnake
may
be
stretched
beside
the
arrow
and
an
invocation
may
be
performed
that
will
convey
the
orenda
from
the
snake
to
the
arrow
or
the
serpent
may
be
made
into
a
witch
s
stew
and
the
arrow
dipped
into
the
brew
no
man
has
contributed
more
to
our
understanding
of
the
doctrine
of
orenda
as
believed
and
practised
by
the
amerindian
tribes
than
cushing
himself
in
other
publications
he
has
elaborately
discussed
this
doctrine
and
in
his
lectures
he
was
wont
to
show
how
forms
and
decorations
of
implements
and
utensils
have
orenda
for
their
motive
when
one
of
the
ancients
that
is
one
of
the
gods
of
the
iroquois
was
planning
the
streams
of
earth
by
his
orenda
or
magical
power
he
determined
to
have
them
run
up
one
side
and
down
the
other
if
he
had
done
this
men
could
float
up
or
down
at
will
by
passing
from
one
side
to
the
other
of
the
river
but
his
wicked
brother
interfered
and
made
them
run
down
on
both
sides
so
orenda
may
thwart
orenda
the
bird
that
sings
is
universally
held
by
tribal
men
to
be
exercising
its
orenda
and
when
human
beings
sing
they
also
exercise
orenda
hence
song
is
a
universal
accompaniment
of
amerindian
worship
all
their
worship
is
thus
fundamentally
terpsichorean
for
it
is
supposed
that
they
can
be
induced
to
grant
favors
by
pleasing
them
all
diseases
and
ailments
of
mankind
are
attributed
by
tribal
men
to
orenda
and
all
mythology
is
a
theory
of
magic
yet
many
of
the
tribes
perhaps
all
of
them
teach
in
their
tales
of
some
method
of
introducing
death
and
disease
into
the
world
but
it
is
a
method
by
which
supernatural
agencies
can
cause
sickness
and
death
the
prophets
who
are
also
priests
and
are
called
shamans
in
scientific
literature
in
popular
literature
and
in
frontier
parlance
they
are
usually
called
shamans
are
usually
initiated
into
the
guild
and
frequently
there
are
elaborate
tribal
ceremonies
for
the
purpose
often
individuals
have
revelations
and
set
up
to
prophesy
to
expel
diseases
and
to
teach
as
priests
if
they
gain
a
following
they
may
ultimately
exert
much
influence
and
be
greatly
revered
but
if
they
fail
they
may
gradually
be
looked
upon
as
wizards
or
witches
and
they
may
be
accused
of
black
art
and
in
extreme
cases
may
be
put
to
death
all
amerindians
believe
in
shamancraft
and
witchcraft
the
myths
of
cosmology
are
usually
called
creation
myths
sometimes
all
myths
which
account
for
things
even
the
most
trivial
are
called
creation
myths
every
striking
phenomenon
observed
by
the
amerind
has
a
myth
designed
to
account
for
its
origin
the
horn
of
the
buffalo
the
tawny
patch
on
the
shoulders
of
the
rabbit
the
crest
of
the
the
tail
of
the
magpie
the
sheen
of
the
chameleon
the
rattle
of
the
snake
in
fact
everything
that
challenges
attention
gives
rise
to
a
myth
thus
the
of
the
amerinds
seem
to
be
inexhaustible
for
in
every
language
and
there
are
hundreds
of
them
a
different
set
of
myths
is
found
in
all
of
these
languages
a
strange
similarity
in
cosmology
is
observed
in
that
it
is
a
cosmology
of
regions
or
worlds
about
the
home
world
of
the
tribe
there
is
gathered
a
group
of
worlds
one
above
another
below
and
four
more
one
at
every
cardinal
point
or
we
may
describe
it
as
a
central
world
an
upper
world
a
lower
world
a
northern
world
a
southern
world
an
eastern
world
and
a
western
world
all
of
the
animals
of
the
tribes
be
they
human
animals
tree
animals
star
animals
water
animals
that
is
bodies
of
water
or
stone
animals
that
is
mountains
hills
valleys
and
rocks
have
an
appropriate
habitation
in
the
zenith
world
the
nadir
world
or
in
one
of
the
cardinal
worlds
and
their
dwelling
in
the
center
world
is
accounted
for
by
some
myth
of
travel
to
this
world
all
bodies
and
all
attributes
of
bodies
have
a
home
or
proper
place
of
habitation
even
the
colors
of
the
clouds
and
the
rainbow
and
of
all
other
objects
on
earth
are
assigned
to
the
six
regions
from
which
they
come
to
the
midworld
we
may
better
understand
this
habit
of
thought
by
considering
the
of
civilization
here
are
but
three
regions
heaven
earth
and
hell
all
good
things
come
from
heaven
and
all
bad
things
from
hell
it
is
true
that
this
cosmology
is
not
entertained
by
scholarly
people
an
enlightened
man
thinks
of
moral
good
as
a
state
of
mind
in
the
individual
an
attribute
of
his
soul
and
a
moral
evil
as
the
characteristic
of
an
immoral
man
but
still
it
is
practically
universal
for
even
the
most
intelligent
to
affirm
by
a
figure
of
speech
that
heaven
is
the
place
of
good
and
hell
the
place
of
evil
now
enlarge
this
conception
so
as
to
assign
a
place
as
the
proper
region
for
all
bodies
and
attributes
and
you
will
understand
the
cosmological
concepts
of
the
amerinds
the
primitive
religion
of
every
amerindian
tribe
is
an
organized
system
of
inducing
the
ancients
to
take
part
in
the
affairs
of
men
and
the
worship
of
the
gods
is
a
system
designed
to
please
the
gods
that
they
may
be
induced
to
act
for
men
particularly
the
tribe
of
men
who
are
the
worshipers
time
would
fail
me
to
tell
of
the
multitude
of
activities
in
tribal
life
designed
for
this
purpose
but
a
few
of
them
may
be
mentioned
the
first
and
most
important
of
all
are
terpsichorean
ceremonies
and
festivals
singing
and
dancing
are
universal
and
festivals
are
given
at
appointed
times
and
places
by
every
tribe
the
long
nights
of
winter
are
devoted
largely
to
worship
and
a
succession
of
festival
days
are
established
to
be
held
at
appropriate
seasons
for
the
worship
of
the
gods
thus
there
are
festival
days
for
invoking
rain
there
are
festival
days
for
thanksgiving
for
harvest
homes
in
lands
where
the
grasshopper
is
an
important
food
there
are
grasshopper
festivals
in
lands
where
corn
is
an
important
food
there
are
festivals
where
the
buffalo
constituted
an
important
part
of
their
aliment
there
were
buffalo
dances
so
there
is
a
bear
dance
or
festival
and
elk
dance
or
festival
and
a
multitude
of
other
festivals
as
we
go
from
tribe
to
tribe
all
of
which
are
fixed
at
times
indicated
by
signs
of
the
zodiac
in
the
higher
tribes
elaborate
calendars
are
devised
from
which
we
unravel
their
the
practice
of
medicine
by
the
shamans
is
an
invocation
to
the
gods
to
drive
out
evil
spirits
from
the
sick
and
to
frighten
them
that
they
may
leave
by
music
and
dancing
they
obtain
the
help
of
the
ancients
and
by
a
great
variety
of
methods
they
drive
out
the
evil
beings
resort
is
often
had
to
scarifying
and
searing
especially
when
the
sick
man
has
great
local
pains
all
american
tribes
entertain
a
profound
belief
in
the
doctrine
of
signatures
similibus
and
they
use
this
belief
in
procuring
charms
as
medicine
to
drive
out
the
ghostly
diseases
that
plague
their
sick
folk
next
in
importance
to
terpsichorean
worship
is
altar
worship
the
altar
is
a
space
cleared
upon
the
ground
or
a
platform
raised
from
the
ground
or
floor
of
the
kiva
or
of
the
people
around
the
altar
are
gathered
the
priests
and
their
acolytes
and
here
they
make
prayers
and
perform
ceremonies
with
the
aid
of
of
various
kinds
especially
tablets
of
on
wood
bone
or
the
skins
of
animals
the
consist
of
representatives
of
the
thing
for
which
supplication
is
made
ears
of
corn
or
vases
of
meal
ewers
of
water
parts
of
animals
designed
for
food
cakes
of
grasshoppers
basins
of
honey
in
fine
any
kind
of
food
then
crystals
or
fragments
of
rock
to
signify
that
they
desire
the
corn
to
be
hard
or
of
honeydew
that
they
desire
the
corn
to
be
sweet
or
of
corn
of
different
colors
that
they
desire
the
corn
to
be
of
a
variety
of
colors
that
which
is
of
great
interest
to
students
of
ethnology
is
the
system
of
exhibited
on
the
altars
in
this
a
great
variety
of
things
which
they
desire
and
a
great
variety
of
the
characteristics
of
these
things
are
represented
in
pictographs
or
modeled
in
clay
or
carved
from
wood
and
bone
the
graphic
art
as
painting
and
sculpture
has
its
origin
with
tribal
men
in
the
development
of
so
also
the
drama
is
derived
from
primeval
worship
as
the
modern
practice
of
medicine
has
been
evolved
from
necromancy
there
is
another
method
of
worship
found
in
savagery
but
more
highly
developed
in
barbarism
the
worship
of
sacrifice
the
and
the
dramatic
supplications
of
the
lower
stage
gradually
develop
into
a
sacrificial
stage
in
the
higher
culture
then
the
objects
are
supposed
to
supply
the
ancients
themselves
with
food
and
drink
and
the
pleasures
of
life
this
stage
was
most
highly
developed
in
mexico
especially
by
the
nahua
or
aztec
where
human
beings
were
sacrificed
in
general
among
the
amerinds
not
only
are
sacrifices
made
on
the
altar
but
they
are
also
made
whenever
food
or
drink
is
used
thus
the
first
portions
of
objects
designed
for
consumption
are
dedicated
to
the
gods
there
are
in
america
many
examples
of
these
pagan
religions
to
a
greater
or
less
extent
affiliated
in
doctrine
and
in
worship
with
the
religion
of
christian
origin
in
the
early
history
of
the
association
of
white
men
with
the
seneca
of
new
york
and
pennsylvania
there
was
in
the
tribe
a
celebrated
shaman
named
handsome
lake
as
his
indian
name
is
translated
into
english
handsome
lake
had
a
nephew
who
was
taken
by
the
spaniards
to
europe
and
educated
as
a
priest
the
nephew
on
his
return
to
america
told
many
bible
stories
to
his
uncle
for
he
speedily
relapsed
into
paganism
the
uncle
compounded
some
of
these
bible
stories
with
seneca
and
through
his
eloquence
and
great
influence
as
a
shaman
succeeded
in
establishing
among
the
seneca
a
new
cult
of
doctrine
and
worship
the
seneca
are
now
divided
into
two
very
distinct
bodies
who
live
together
on
the
same
reservation
the
one
are
christians
the
other
are
pagans
who
believe
and
teach
the
cult
of
handsome
lake
cushing
has
introduced
a
hybrid
tale
into
his
collection
entitled
the
cock
and
the
such
tales
are
found
again
and
again
among
the
amerinds
in
a
large
majority
of
cases
bible
stories
are
compounded
with
native
stories
so
that
unwary
people
have
been
led
to
believe
that
the
amerinds
are
descendants
of
the
lost

folk
tales
the
trial
of
lovers
or
the
maiden
of
mátsaki
and
the
red
feather
the
first
in
the
days
of
the
ancients
when
mátsaki
was
the
home
of
the
children
of
men
there
lived
in
that
town
which
is
called
salt
city
because
the
goddess
of
salt
made
a
white
lake
there
in
the
days
of
the
new
a
beautiful
maiden
she
was
passing
beautiful
and
the
daughter
of
the
who
owned
more
buckskins
and
blankets
than
he
could
hang
on
his
poles
and
whose
were
covered
with
turquoises
and
precious
shells
from
the
ocean
so
many
were
the
sacrifices
he
made
to
the
gods
his
house
was
the
largest
in
mátsaki
and
his
were
tall
and
decorated
with
slabs
of
carved
wood
which
you
know
was
a
great
thing
for
our
grandfathers
cut
with
the
or
flint
knife
and
even
tilled
their
with
wooden
hoes
sharpened
with
stone
and
weighted
with
granite
that
s
the
reason
why
all
the
young
men
in
the
towns
round
about
were
in
love
with
the
beautiful
maiden
of
salt
city
now
there
was
one
very
fine
young
man
who
lived
across
the
western
plains
in
the
pueblo
of
the
winds
he
was
so
filled
with
thoughts
of
the
maiden
of
mátsaki
that
he
labored
long
to
gather
presents
for
her
and
looked
not
with
favor
on
any
girl
of
his
own
pueblo
one
morning
he
said
to
his
fathers
i
have
seen
the
maiden
of
mátsaki
what
think
ye
be
it
well
said
the
old
ones
so
toward
night
the
young
man
made
a
bundle
of
mantles
and
necklaces
which
he
rolled
up
in
the
best
and
whitest
buckskin
he
had
when
the
sun
was
setting
he
started
toward
mátsaki
and
just
as
the
old
man
s
children
had
gathered
in
to
smoke
and
talk
he
reached
the
house
of
the
maiden
s
father
and
climbed
the
ladder
he
lifted
the
corner
of
the
mat
door
and
shouted
to
the
people
below
answered
more
than
a
pair
of
voices
from
below
pull
me
down
cried
the
young
man
at
the
same
time
showing
his
bundle
through
the
the
maiden
s
mother
rose
and
helped
the
young
man
down
the
ladder
and
as
he
entered
the
he
laid
the
bundle
down
my
fathers
and
mothers
my
sisters
and
friends
how
be
ye
these
many
days
said
he
very
carefully
as
though
he
were
speaking
to
a
council
happy
happy
they
all
responded
and
they
said
also
sit
down
sit
down
on
this
stool
which
they
placed
for
him
in
the
my
daughter
remarked
the
old
man
who
was
smoking
his
cigarette
by
the
opposite
side
of
the
when
a
stranger
enters
the
house
of
a
stranger
the
girl
should
place
before
him
food
and
cooked
so
the
girl
brought
from
the
great
vessel
in
the
corner
fresh
rolls
of
or
bread
of
thin
as
papers
and
placed
them
in
a
tray
before
the
young
man
where
the
light
would
fall
on
them
eat
said
she
and
he
replied
it
is
whereupon
he
sat
up
very
straight
and
placing
his
left
hand
across
his
breast
very
slowly
took
a
roll
of
the
wafer
bread
with
his
right
hand
and
ate
ever
so
little
for
you
know
it
is
not
well
or
polite
to
eat
much
when
you
go
to
see
a
strange
girl
especially
if
you
want
to
ask
her
if
she
will
let
you
live
in
the
same
house
with
her
so
the
young
man
ate
ever
so
little
and
said
thank
eat
more
said
the
old
ones
but
when
he
replied
that
he
was
past
the
naming
of
want
they
said
have
eaten
and
the
girl
carried
the
tray
away
and
swept
away
the
crumbs
well
said
the
old
man
after
a
short
time
when
a
stranger
enters
the
house
of
a
stranger
it
is
not
thinking
of
nothing
that
he
why
that
is
quite
true
said
the
youth
and
then
he
waited
then
what
may
it
be
that
thou
hast
come
thinking
of
added
the
old
man
i
have
heard
said
the
young
man
of
your
daughter
and
have
seen
her
and
it
was
with
thoughts
of
her
that
i
just
then
the
sons
of
the
old
man
who
had
come
to
smoke
and
chat
rose
and
said
to
one
another
is
it
not
about
time
we
should
be
going
home
the
stars
must
be
all
thus
saying
they
bade
the
old
ones
to
wait
happily
until
the
morning
and
shook
hands
with
the
young
man
who
had
come
and
went
to
the
homes
of
their
wives
mothers
listen
my
child
said
the
old
man
after
they
had
gone
away
turning
toward
his
daughter
who
was
sitting
near
the
wall
and
looking
down
at
the
beads
on
her
belt
fringe
listen
you
have
heard
what
the
young
man
has
said
what
think
you
why
i
know
not
but
what
should
i
say
but
be
it
well
said
the
girl
if
thus
think
my
old
ones
as
you
may
said
the
old
man
and
then
he
made
a
cigarette
and
smoked
with
the
young
man
when
he
had
thrown
away
his
cigarette
he
said
to
the
mother
old
one
is
it
not
time
to
stretch
out
so
when
the
old
ones
were
asleep
in
the
corner
the
girl
said
to
the
youth
but
in
a
low
voice
only
possibly
you
love
me
true
i
have
said
be
it
well
but
before
i
take
your
bundle
and
say
thanks
i
would
that
you
to
prove
that
you
verily
love
me
should
go
down
into
my
among
the
lands
of
the
by
the
side
of
the
river
and
hoe
all
the
corn
in
a
single
morning
if
you
will
do
this
then
shall
i
know
you
love
me
then
shall
i
take
of
your
presents
and
happy
we
will
be
very
well
replied
the
young
man
i
am
then
the
young
girl
lighted
a
bundle
of
cedar
splints
and
showed
him
a
room
which
contained
a
bed
of
soft
robes
and
blankets
and
placing
her
father
s
hoe
near
the
door
bade
the
young
man
wait
happily
unto
the
so
when
she
had
gone
he
looked
at
the
hoe
and
thought
ha
if
that
be
all
she
shall
see
in
the
morning
that
i
am
a
at
the
peep
of
day
over
the
eastern
mesa
he
roused
himself
and
shouldering
the
wooden
hoe
ran
down
to
the
and
when
as
the
sun
was
coming
out
the
young
girl
awoke
and
looked
down
from
her
aha
thought
she
he
is
doing
well
but
my
children
and
i
shall
see
how
he
gets
on
somewhat
later
i
doubt
if
he
loves
me
as
much
as
he
thinks
he
so
she
went
into
a
closed
room
down
in
the
corner
stood
a
water
jar
beautifully
painted
and
as
bright
as
new
it
looked
like
other
water
jars
but
it
was
not
it
was
wonderful
wonderful
for
it
was
covered
with
a
stone
lid
which
held
down
many
and
gnats
and
mosquitoes
the
maiden
lifted
the
lid
and
began
to
speak
to
the
little
animals
as
though
she
were
praying
now
then
my
children
this
day
fly
ye
forth
all
and
in
the
by
the
river
there
shall
ye
see
a
young
man
hoeing
so
hard
is
he
working
that
he
is
stripped
as
for
a
race
go
forth
and
seek
said
the
flies
and
sang
the
gnats
and
mosquitoes
which
meant
yes
you
know
and
further
said
the
girl
when
ye
find
him
bite
him
his
body
all
over
and
eat
ye
freely
of
his
blood
spare
not
his
armpits
neither
his
neck
nor
his
eyelids
and
fill
his
ears
with
and
again
the
flies
said
and
the
mosquitoes
and
gnats
then
away
they
all
flew
like
a
cloud
of
sand
on
a
windy
morning
blood
exclaimed
the
young
man
he
wiped
the
sweat
from
his
face
and
said
the
gods
be
angry
then
he
dropped
his
hoe
and
rubbed
his
shins
with
sand
and
slapped
his
sides
he
yelled
what
matters
what
in
the
name
of
the
moon
mother
matters
with
these
little
beasts
that
cause
thoughts
whereupon
crazed
and
restless
as
a
spider
on
hot
ashes
he
rolled
in
the
dust
but
to
no
purpose
for
the
flies
and
gnats
and
mosquitoes
sang
and
about
his
ears
until
he
grabbed
up
his
blanket
and
breakfast
and
ran
toward
the
home
of
his
fathers
ha
ho
o
laughed
a
young
man
in
the
tented
pueblo
to
the
north
when
he
heard
how
the
lover
had
fared
he
sneered
much
of
a
man
he
must
have
been
to
give
up
the
maid
of
mátsaki
for
and
gnats
and
mosquitoes
so
on
the
very
next
morning
he
too
said
to
his
old
ones
what
a
fool
that
little
must
have
been
i
will
visit
the
maiden
of
mátsaki
i
ll
show
the
people
of
pínawa
what
a
hámpasawan
man
can
do
courage
and
as
the
old
ones
said
be
it
well
he
went
as
the
other
had
gone
but
pshaw
he
fared
no
better
after
some
time
a
young
man
who
lived
in
the
river
town
heard
about
it
and
laughed
as
hard
as
the
youth
of
the
tented
pueblo
had
he
called
the
two
others
fools
and
said
that
girls
were
not
in
the
habit
of
asking
much
when
one
s
bundle
was
and
as
he
was
a
young
man
who
had
everything
he
made
a
bundle
of
presents
as
large
as
he
could
carry
but
it
did
him
no
good
he
too
ran
away
from
the
and
gnats
and
mosquitoes
many
days
passed
before
any
one
else
would
try
again
to
woo
the
maiden
of
mátsaki
they
did
not
know
it
is
true
that
she
was
a
passing
being
but
others
had
failed
all
on
account
of
mosquitoes
and
and
little
black
gnats
and
had
been
more
satisfied
with
shame
than
a
full
hungry
man
with
food
that
is
sick
satisfaction
they
would
say
to
one
another
the
fear
of
which
made
them
wait
to
see
what
others
would
do
now
in
the
ant
hill
which
was
named
hálonawan
lived
a
handsome
young
man
but
he
was
poor
although
the
son
of
the
of
hálonawan
he
thought
many
days
and
at
last
said
to
his
grandmother
who
was
very
old
and
crafty
the
ancient
pueblo
of
zuñi
itself
was
called
hálonawan
or
the
ant
hill
the
ruins
of
which
now
buried
beneath
the
sands
lie
opposite
the
modern
town
within
the
cast
of
a
stone
long
before
hálonawan
was
abandoned
the
nucleus
of
the
present
structure
was
begun
around
one
of
the
now
central
plazas
it
was
then
and
still
is
in
the
ancient
songs
and
rituals
of
the
zuñis
or
the
middle
ant
hill
of
the
world
and
was
often
spoken
of
in
connection
with
the
older
town
as
simply
the
ant
what
sayest
my
said
the
old
woman
for
like
grandmothers
nowadays
she
was
very
soft
and
gentle
to
her
grandson
i
have
seen
the
maiden
of
mátsaki
and
my
thoughts
kill
me
with
longing
for
she
is
passing
beautiful
and
wisely
slow
i
do
not
wonder
that
she
asks
hard
tasks
of
her
lovers
for
it
is
not
of
their
bundles
that
she
thinks
but
of
themselves
now
i
strengthen
my
thoughts
with
my
manliness
my
heart
is
hard
against
weariness
and
i
would
go
and
speak
to
the
beautiful
á
my
poor
boy
said
the
grandmother
she
is
as
wonderful
as
she
is
wise
and
beautiful
she
thinks
not
of
men
save
as
brothers
and
friends
and
she
it
is
i
bethink
me
who
sends
the
and
gnats
and
mosquitoes
therefore
to
drive
them
away
they
are
but
disguised
beings
and
beware
my
grandson
you
will
only
cover
yourself
with
shame
as
a
man
is
covered
with
water
who
walks
through
a
i
would
not
go
my
poor
grandchild
i
would
not
go
she
added
shaking
her
head
and
biting
her
lips
till
her
chin
touched
her
yes
but
i
must
go
my
grandmother
why
should
i
live
only
to
breathe
hard
with
longing
perhaps
she
will
better
her
thoughts
toward
ah
yes
but
all
the
same
she
will
test
thee
well
go
to
the
mountains
and
scrape
bitter
bark
from
the
make
a
little
loaf
of
the
bark
and
hide
it
in
your
belt
and
when
the
maiden
sends
you
down
to
the
work
hard
at
the
hoeing
until
sunrise
then
when
your
body
is
covered
with
rub
every
part
with
the
the
bark
it
is
bitter
as
bad
salt
mixed
in
with
bad
water
and
the
and
and
fly
far
from
the
salt
that
is
then
my
gentle
grandmother
i
will
try
your
words
and
thank
you
for
he
was
as
gentle
and
good
as
his
grandmother
was
knowing
and
crafty
even
that
day
he
went
to
the
mountains
and
gathered
a
ball
of
then
toward
evening
he
took
a
little
bundle
and
went
up
the
trail
by
the
to
mátsaki
when
he
climbed
the
ladder
and
shouted
down
the
mat
door
are
ye
within
the
people
did
not
answer
at
once
for
the
old
ones
were
angry
with
their
daughter
that
she
had
sent
off
so
many
fine
lovers
but
when
he
shouted
again
they
answered
and
we
are
within
be
yourself
then
without
help
he
went
down
the
ladder
but
he
didn
t
mind
for
he
felt
himself
poor
and
his
bundle
was
small
as
he
entered
the
he
greeted
the
people
pleasantly
and
gravely
and
with
thanks
took
the
seat
that
was
laid
for
him
now
you
see
the
old
man
was
angry
with
the
girl
so
he
did
not
tell
her
to
place
cooked
things
before
him
but
turned
to
his
old
wife
old
one
he
began
but
before
he
had
finished
the
maiden
arose
and
brought
rich
venison
stew
and
flaky
which
she
placed
before
the
youth
where
the
fire
s
brightness
would
fall
upon
it
with
meat
broth
for
drink
then
she
sat
down
opposite
him
and
said
eat
and
drink
whereupon
the
young
man
took
a
roll
of
the
and
breaking
it
in
two
gave
the
girl
the
larger
piece
which
she
bashfully
accepted
the
old
man
raised
his
eyebrows
and
upper
lids
looked
at
his
old
wife
spat
in
the
fireplace
and
smoked
hard
at
his
cigarette
joining
the
girl
in
her
invitation
by
saying
yes
have
to
eat
soon
the
young
man
said
thanks
and
the
maiden
quickly
responded
eat
more
and
have
after
brushing
the
crumbs
away
the
girl
sat
down
by
her
mother
and
the
father
rolled
a
cigarette
for
the
young
man
and
talked
longer
with
him
than
he
had
with
the
others
after
the
old
ones
had
stretched
out
in
the
corner
and
begun
to
scrape
their
nostrils
with
their
breath
the
maiden
turned
to
the
young
man
and
said
i
have
a
in
the
lands
of
the
down
by
the
river
and
if
you
truly
love
me
i
would
that
you
should
hoe
the
whole
in
a
single
morning
thus
may
you
prove
yourself
a
man
and
to
love
me
truly
and
if
you
will
do
this
happily
as
day
follows
day
will
we
live
each
with
the
replied
the
young
man
who
smiled
as
he
listened
and
as
the
young
maiden
looked
at
him
sitting
in
the
fading
with
the
smile
on
his
face
she
thought
only
possibly
but
oh
how
i
wish
his
heart
might
be
strong
even
though
his
bundle
be
not
heavy
nor
large
come
with
me
young
man
and
i
will
show
you
where
you
are
to
await
the
morning
early
take
my
father
s
hoe
which
stands
by
the
doorway
and
go
down
to
the
long
before
the
night
shadows
have
run
away
from
thunder
mountain
with
which
she
bade
him
pass
a
night
of
contentment
and
sought
her
own
place
when
all
was
still
the
young
man
climbed
to
the
and
in
the
starlight
asked
the
gods
of
the
woodlands
and
waters
to
give
strength
to
his
hands
and
power
to
his
and
to
meet
and
bless
him
with
the
light
of
their
favor
and
he
threw
to
the
meal
of
the
seeds
of
earth
and
the
waters
of
the
world
with
which
those
who
are
wise
fail
not
to
make
smooth
their
trails
of
life
then
he
slept
till
the
sky
of
the
grew
yellow
and
the
shadows
of
the
grew
gray
and
then
shouldered
his
hoe
and
went
down
to
the
his
task
was
not
great
for
the
others
had
hoed
much
where
they
left
off
there
he
fell
to
digging
right
and
left
with
all
his
strength
and
haste
till
the
hard
soil
mellowed
and
the
earth
flew
before
his
strokes
as
out
of
the
burrows
of
the
gophers
and
other
digging
creatures
when
the
sun
rose
the
maiden
looked
forth
and
saw
that
his
task
was
already
half
done
but
still
she
waited
as
the
sun
warmed
the
day
and
the
youth
worked
on
the
dewdrops
of
flesh
stood
all
over
his
body
and
he
cast
away
one
after
the
other
his
blanket
and
sash
and
even
his
leggings
and
moccasins
then
he
stopped
to
look
around
by
the
side
of
the
field
grew
tall
he
ran
into
the
thicket
and
rubbed
every
part
of
his
body
yea
even
the
hair
of
his
head
and
his
and
nostrils
with
the
bark
of
the
again
he
fell
to
work
as
though
he
had
only
been
resting
and
wondered
why
the
and
gnats
and
mosquitoes
came
not
to
cause
him
thoughts
as
they
had
the
others
yet
still
the
girl
lingered
but
at
last
she
went
slowly
to
the
room
where
the
jar
stood
it
is
absurd
thought
she
that
i
should
hope
it
or
even
care
for
it
it
would
indeed
be
great
if
it
were
well
true
that
a
young
man
should
love
me
so
verily
as
to
hold
his
face
to
the
front
through
such
a
nevertheless
she
drew
the
lid
off
and
bade
her
strange
children
to
spare
him
no
more
than
they
had
the
others
all
hasty
to
feast
themselves
on
the
waters
of
life
as
our
old
grandfathers
would
say
for
blood
again
they
rushed
out
and
hummed
along
over
the
in
such
numbers
that
they
looked
more
like
a
sandstorm
than
ever
and
they
hummed
and
buzzed
about
the
ears
of
the
young
man
when
they
came
to
him
so
noisily
that
the
poor
fellow
who
kept
at
work
all
the
while
thought
they
were
already
biting
him
but
it
was
only
fancy
for
the
first
that
did
bite
him
danced
in
the
air
with
disgust
and
exclaimed
to
his
companions
and
which
meant
that
he
had
eaten
something
nasty
that
tasted
as
badly
as
vile
odors
smell
so
not
another
in
the
throng
would
bite
although
they
all
kept
singing
their
song
about
his
ears
and
to
this
day
are
careful
whom
they
bite
and
dance
a
long
time
in
the
air
before
they
do
it
then
a
gnat
tried
it
and
gasped
which
meant
that
his
stomach
had
turned
over
and
he
had
such
a
sick
headache
that
he
reeled
round
and
round
in
the
air
and
for
that
reason
gnats
always
bite
very
quickly
for
fear
their
stomachs
will
turn
over
and
they
will
reel
and
reel
round
and
round
in
the
air
before
doing
it
finally
himself
tried
it
and
as
hangs
on
you
know
longer
than
most
other
little
beasts
he
kept
hold
until
his
two
hindlegs
were
warped
out
of
shape
but
at
last
he
had
to
let
go
too
and
flew
straight
away
crying
kotchi
which
meant
that
something
bitter
had
burned
his
snout
now
for
these
reasons
mosquitoes
always
have
hindlegs
which
they
keep
lifting
up
and
down
while
biting
as
though
they
were
standing
on
something
hot
and
they
are
apt
to
sing
and
smell
around
very
cautiously
before
spearing
us
and
they
fly
straight
away
you
will
notice
as
soon
as
they
are
done
now
when
the
rest
of
the
gnats
and
mosquitoes
heard
the
words
of
their
elder
brothers
they
did
as
the
had
done
did
not
venture
no
not
one
of
them
to
bite
the
young
lover
they
all
flew
away
and
settled
down
on
the
where
they
had
a
council
and
decided
to
go
and
find
some
to
bite
therefore
you
will
almost
always
find
gnats
and
mosquitoes
around
holes
in
summer
time
when
the
corn
is
growing
so
the
young
man
breathed
easily
as
he
hoed
hard
to
finish
his
task
ere
the
and
when
the
maiden
looked
down
and
saw
that
he
still
labored
there
she
said
to
herself
ah
indeed
he
must
love
me
for
still
he
is
there
well
it
for
only
a
little
longer
and
they
will
leave
him
in
hastily
she
placed
venison
in
the
and
prepared
fresh
and
sweetened
bread
for
she
still
thought
and
then
i
will
have
it
ready
for
now
alas
you
do
not
know
that
this
good
and
beautiful
maiden
had
a
sister
alas
a
sister
as
beautiful
as
herself
but
bad
and
and
you
know
when
people
have
double
hearts
they
are
wizards
or
witches
and
have
double
tongues
and
paired
thoughts
such
a
sister
elder
had
the
maiden
of
mátsaki
alas
when
the
sun
had
climbed
almost
to
the
middle
of
the
sky
the
maiden
still
doubtful
looked
down
once
more
he
was
there
and
was
working
among
the
last
hills
of
corn
ah
truly
indeed
he
loves
me
she
thought
and
she
hastened
to
put
on
her
necklaces
and
bracelets
of
shells
her
earrings
as
long
as
your
fingers
of
turquoises
and
her
fine
cotton
mantles
with
borders
of
stitched
butterflies
of
summerland
and
flowers
of
the
autumn
then
she
took
a
new
bowl
from
the
in
the
corner
and
a
large
tray
that
she
had
woven
herself
and
she
filled
the
one
with
meat
broth
and
the
other
with
the
and
and
placing
the
bowl
of
meat
broth
on
her
head
she
took
the
tray
of
in
her
hand
and
started
down
toward
the
by
the
to
meet
her
lover
and
to
thank
him
witches
are
always
jealous
of
the
happiness
and
good
fortune
of
others
so
was
the
sister
of
the
beautiful
maiden
jealous
when
she
saw
the
smile
on
her
face
as
she
tripped
toward
the
river
há
said
the
sister
thlokwá
wananí
which
are
words
of
defiance
and
hatred
used
so
long
ago
by
demons
and
wizards
that
no
one
knows
nowadays
what
they
mean
except
the
last
one
which
plainly
says
just
wait
a
bit
and
she
hastened
to
dress
herself
through
her
wicked
knowledge
exactly
as
the
beautiful
maiden
was
dressed
she
even
carried
just
such
a
bowl
and
tray
and
as
she
was
beautiful
like
her
younger
sister
nobody
could
have
known
the
one
from
the
other
or
the
other
from
the
one
then
she
passed
herself
through
a
hoop
of
magic
yucca
which
made
her
seem
not
to
be
where
she
was
for
no
one
could
see
her
unless
she
willed
it
now
just
as
the
sun
was
resting
in
the
middle
of
the
sky
the
young
man
finished
the
field
and
ran
down
to
the
river
to
before
he
was
done
he
saw
the
maiden
coming
down
the
trail
with
the
bowl
on
her
head
and
the
tray
in
her
hand
so
he
made
haste
and
ran
back
to
dress
himself
and
to
sit
down
to
wait
for
her
as
she
approached
he
said
thou
comest
and
may
it
be
happily
when
lo
there
appeared
two
maidens
exactly
alike
so
he
quickly
said
ye
said
the
maidens
so
nearly
together
that
it
sounded
like
one
voice
but
when
they
both
placed
the
same
food
before
him
the
poor
young
man
looked
from
one
to
the
other
and
asked
alas
of
which
am
i
to
eat
then
it
was
that
the
maiden
suddenly
saw
her
sister
and
became
hot
with
anger
for
she
knew
her
wicked
plans
ah
thou
foolish
sister
why
didst
thou
come
she
said
but
the
other
only
replied
ah
thou
foolish
sister
why
didst
come
go
back
for
he
is
said
the
maiden
beginning
to
cry
go
back
for
he
is
said
the
bad
one
pretending
to
cry
and
thus
they
quarrelled
until
they
had
given
one
another
smarting
words
four
times
when
they
fell
to
fighting
as
women
always
fight
by
pulling
each
other
s
hair
and
scratching
and
grappling
until
they
rolled
over
each
other
in
the
sand
the
poor
young
man
started
forward
to
part
them
but
he
knew
not
one
from
the
other
so
thinking
that
the
bad
one
must
know
how
to
fight
better
than
his
beautiful
maiden
wife
he
suddenly
caught
up
his
hoe
and
furiously
struck
the
one
that
was
uppermost
on
the
head
again
and
again
until
she
let
go
her
hold
and
fell
back
murmuring
and
moaning
alas
that
thus
it
should
be
after
all
after
all
then
she
forgot
and
her
eyes
ceased
to
see
while
yet
the
young
man
looked
lo
there
was
only
the
dying
maiden
before
him
but
in
the
air
above
circled
an
ugly
black
crow
that
laughed
kawkaw
kawkaw
and
flew
away
to
its
cave
in
thunder
mountain
then
the
young
man
knew
he
cried
aloud
and
beat
his
breast
then
he
ran
to
the
river
and
brought
water
and
bathed
the
blood
away
from
the
maiden
s
temples
but
alas
she
only
smiled
and
talked
with
her
lips
then
grew
still
and
cold
alone
as
the
sun
travelled
toward
the
land
of
evening
wept
the
young
man
over
the
body
of
his
beautiful
wife
he
knew
naught
but
his
sad
thoughts
he
took
her
in
his
arms
and
placed
his
face
close
to
hers
and
again
and
again
he
called
to
her
alas
alas
my
beautiful
wife
i
loved
thee
i
love
thee
alas
alas
ah
my
beautiful
wife
my
beautiful
wife
when
the
people
returned
from
their
fields
in
the
evening
they
missed
the
beautiful
maiden
of
mátsaki
and
they
saw
the
young
man
bending
low
and
alone
over
something
down
in
the
lands
of
the
by
the
river
and
when
they
told
the
old
father
he
shook
his
head
and
said
it
is
not
well
with
my
beautiful
child
but
as
they
the
gods
say
thus
must
all
things
then
he
smiled
for
the
heart
of
a
never
cries
and
told
them
to
go
and
bring
her
to
the
plaza
of
mátsaki
and
bury
her
before
the
house
of
the
sun
for
he
knew
what
had
happened
so
the
people
did
as
their
father
had
told
them
they
went
down
at
sunset
and
took
the
beautiful
maiden
away
and
wrapped
her
in
mantles
and
buried
her
near
the
house
of
the
sun
but
the
poor
young
man
knew
naught
but
his
sad
thoughts
he
followed
them
and
when
he
had
made
her
grave
he
sat
down
by
her
earth
bed
and
would
not
leave
her
no
not
even
when
the
sun
set
but
moaned
and
called
to
her
alas
alas
my
beautiful
wife
i
loved
thee
i
love
thee
even
though
i
knew
not
thee
and
killed
thee
alas
ah
my
beautiful
wife
there
is
left
of
my
and
what
there
is
left
i
will
tell
you
some
other
night
the
second
shonetchi
there
is
left
of
my
story
but
i
will
tell
you
not
alone
of
the
maid
of
mátsaki
because
the
young
man
killed
her
for
he
knew
not
his
wife
from
the
other
it
is
of
the
red
feather
or
the
wife
of
mátsaki
that
i
will
tell
you
this
sitting
even
when
the
sun
set
and
the
hills
and
houses
grew
black
in
the
shadows
still
the
young
man
sat
by
the
his
hands
rested
upon
his
knees
and
his
face
buried
in
them
and
the
people
no
longer
tried
to
steal
his
sad
thoughts
from
him
but
instead
left
him
as
one
whose
mind
errs
to
wail
out
with
weeping
alas
alas
my
beautiful
wife
i
loved
thee
i
love
thee
even
though
i
knew
not
thee
and
killed
thee
alas
ah
my
beautiful
wife
but
when
the
moon
set
on
the
western
hills
and
the
great
snowdrift
streaked
across
the
and
the
night
was
half
gone
the
sad
watcher
saw
a
light
in
the
like
the
light
of
the
embers
that
die
in
the
ashes
as
he
watched
his
sad
thoughts
became
bright
thoughts
for
the
light
grew
and
brightened
till
it
burned
the
dark
as
sunlight
the
shadows
lo
the
bride
lay
beneath
she
tore
off
her
mantles
and
raised
up
in
her
then
she
looked
at
the
eager
lover
so
coldly
and
sadly
that
his
bright
thoughts
all
darkened
for
she
mournfully
told
him
alas
ah
my
lover
my
husband
knew
not
me
from
the
other
loved
me
not
therefore
killed
me
even
though
i
had
hoped
for
love
loved
me
not
therefore
killed
me
again
the
young
man
buried
his
face
in
his
hands
and
shook
his
head
mournfully
and
like
one
whose
thoughts
erred
again
he
wailed
his
lament
alas
alas
my
beautiful
bride
i
do
love
thee
i
loved
thee
but
i
did
not
know
thee
and
killed
thee
alas
ah
my
beautiful
bride
my
beautiful
bride
at
last
as
the
great
star
rose
from
the
the
dead
maiden
spoke
softly
to
the
mourning
lover
yet
her
voice
was
sad
and
strange
young
man
mourn
thou
not
but
go
back
to
the
home
of
thy
fathers
knowest
thou
not
that
i
am
another
being
when
the
sky
of
the
grows
yellow
and
the
houses
come
out
of
the
shadows
then
will
the
light
whereby
thou
sawest
me
fade
away
in
the
as
the
blazes
of
late
councils
pale
their
red
in
the
then
her
voice
grew
sadder
as
she
said
i
am
only
a
spirit
for
remember
alas
ah
my
lover
my
husband
knew
not
me
from
the
other
loved
me
not
therefore
killed
me
even
though
i
had
hoped
for
love
loved
me
not
therefore
killed
but
the
young
man
would
not
go
until
in
the
gray
of
the
morning
he
saw
nothing
where
the
light
had
appeared
but
the
dark
sand
of
the
grave
as
it
had
been
then
he
arose
and
went
away
in
sorrow
nor
would
he
all
day
speak
to
men
but
gazed
only
whither
his
feet
stepped
and
shook
his
head
sadly
like
one
whose
thoughts
wandered
and
when
again
the
houses
and
hills
grew
black
with
the
shadows
he
sought
anew
the
fresh
grave
and
sat
down
by
its
side
bowed
his
head
and
still
murmured
alas
alas
my
beautiful
wife
i
loved
thee
though
i
knew
not
thee
and
killed
thee
alas
ah
my
beautiful
wife
even
brighter
glowed
the
light
in
the
when
the
night
was
divided
and
the
maiden
s
spirit
arose
and
sat
in
her
but
she
only
reproached
him
and
bade
him
go
for
said
she
i
am
only
a
spirit
remember
alas
ah
my
lover
my
husband
knew
not
me
from
the
other
loved
me
not
therefore
killed
me
even
though
i
had
hoped
for
love
loved
me
not
therefore
killed
me
but
he
left
only
in
the
morning
and
again
when
the
dark
came
returned
to
the
when
the
light
shone
that
night
the
maiden
more
beautiful
than
ever
came
out
of
the
and
sat
by
her
lover
once
more
she
urged
him
to
return
to
his
fathers
but
when
she
saw
that
he
would
not
she
said
thou
hadst
better
for
i
go
a
long
journey
as
light
as
the
wind
is
so
light
will
my
feet
be
as
long
as
the
day
is
thou
canst
not
my
form
see
know
thou
not
that
the
spirits
are
seen
but
in
darkness
for
alas
ah
my
lover
my
husband
knew
not
me
from
the
other
loved
me
not
therefore
killed
me
even
though
i
had
hoped
for
love
loved
me
not
therefore
killed
me
then
the
young
man
ceased
bemoaning
his
beautiful
bride
he
looked
at
her
sadly
and
said
i
do
love
thee
my
beautiful
wife
i
do
love
thee
and
whither
thou
goest
let
me
therefore
go
with
thee
i
care
not
how
long
is
the
journey
nor
how
hard
is
the
way
if
i
can
but
see
thee
even
only
at
night
time
then
will
i
be
happy
and
cease
to
bemoan
thee
it
was
because
i
loved
thee
and
would
have
saved
thee
but
alas
my
beautiful
wife
i
knew
not
thee
therefore
killed
thee
alas
ah
my
lover
and
ah
how
i
loved
thee
but
i
am
a
spirit
and
thou
art
unfinished
but
if
thou
thus
love
me
go
back
when
i
leave
thee
and
plume
many
choose
a
light
downy
feather
and
dye
it
with
ocher
wrap
up
in
thy
blanket
a
lunch
for
four
daylights
bring
with
thee
much
come
to
me
at
midnight
and
sit
by
my
and
when
in
the
eastward
the
is
lighting
tie
over
my
forehead
the
reddened
light
feather
and
when
with
the
morning
i
fade
from
thy
vision
follow
only
the
feather
until
it
is
evening
and
then
thou
shalt
see
me
and
sit
down
beside
so
at
sunrise
the
young
man
went
away
and
gathered
feathers
of
the
summer
birds
and
cut
many
whereon
he
bound
them
with
cotton
as
gifts
to
the
fathers
then
he
found
a
beautiful
downy
feather
plucked
from
the
eagle
and
dyed
it
red
with
ocher
and
tied
to
it
a
string
of
cotton
wherewith
to
fasten
it
over
the
forehead
of
the
spirit
maiden
when
night
came
he
took
meal
made
from
parched
corn
and
burnt
and
once
more
went
down
to
the
plaza
and
sat
by
the
when
midnight
came
and
the
light
glowed
forth
through
the
lo
the
came
out
and
stood
by
his
side
she
seemed
no
longer
sad
but
happy
like
one
going
home
after
long
absence
nor
was
the
young
man
sad
or
like
one
whose
mind
errs
so
they
sat
together
and
talked
of
their
journey
till
the
grew
yellow
and
the
black
shadows
gray
and
the
houses
and
hills
came
out
of
the
darkness
once
more
would
i
tell
thee
to
go
back
said
the
maiden
s
spirit
to
the
young
man
but
i
know
why
thou
goest
with
me
and
it
is
well
only
watch
me
when
the
day
comes
and
thou
wilt
see
me
no
more
but
look
whither
the
plume
goeth
and
follow
for
thou
knowest
that
thou
must
tie
it
to
the
hair
above
my
then
the
young
man
took
the
bright
red
plume
out
from
among
the
feathers
of
sacrifice
and
gently
tied
it
above
the
s
forehead
as
the
light
waved
up
from
behind
the
great
mountain
the
red
glow
faded
out
from
the
and
the
youth
looked
in
vain
for
the
spirit
of
the
maiden
but
before
him
at
the
height
of
one
s
hands
when
standing
waved
the
light
downy
feather
in
the
wind
of
the
morning
then
the
plume
not
the
wife
rose
before
him
like
the
plumes
on
the
head
of
a
dancer
and
moved
through
the
streets
that
led
westward
and
down
through
the
fields
to
the
river
and
out
through
the
streets
that
led
westward
and
down
on
the
trail
by
the
river
and
on
over
the
plains
always
toward
the
land
of
evening
the
young
man
followed
close
the
red
feather
but
at
last
he
began
to
grow
weary
for
the
plume
glided
swiftly
before
him
until
at
last
it
left
him
far
behind
and
even
now
and
then
lost
him
entirely
then
as
he
hastened
on
he
called
in
anguish
my
beautiful
bride
my
beautiful
bride
oh
where
art
thou
but
the
plume
not
the
wife
stopped
and
waited
and
thus
the
plume
and
the
young
man
journeyed
until
toward
evening
they
came
to
the
forests
of
piñons
and
cedars
as
the
night
hid
the
hills
in
the
shadows
alas
the
plume
disappeared
but
the
young
man
pressed
onward
for
he
knew
that
the
plume
still
journeyed
westward
yet
at
times
he
was
so
weary
that
he
almost
lost
the
strength
of
his
thoughts
for
he
ran
into
trees
by
the
and
stumbled
over
dry
roots
and
branches
so
again
and
again
he
would
call
out
in
anguish
my
beautiful
wife
my
beautiful
bride
oh
where
art
thou
at
last
when
the
night
was
divided
to
his
joy
he
saw
far
away
on
the
a
light
that
was
red
and
grew
brighter
like
the
light
of
a
s
red
embers
when
fanned
by
the
wind
of
the
and
like
a
star
that
is
rising
or
setting
the
red
light
sat
still
on
the
so
he
ran
hastily
forward
until
as
he
neared
the
red
light
lo
there
sat
the
spirit
of
the
beautiful
maiden
and
as
he
neared
her
she
said
comest
thou
and
how
hast
thou
come
to
the
evening
as
she
spoke
she
smiled
and
motioned
him
to
sit
down
beside
her
he
was
so
weary
that
he
slept
while
he
talked
to
her
but
remember
she
was
a
spirit
therefore
she
slept
not
just
as
the
morning
star
came
up
from
the
the
maiden
rose
to
journey
on
and
the
young
man
awaking
followed
her
but
as
the
hills
came
out
of
the
shadows
the
form
of
the
maiden
before
him
grew
fainter
and
fainter
until
it
faded
entirely
and
only
the
red
plume
floated
before
him
like
the
plume
on
the
head
of
a
dancer
far
ahead
and
fast
floated
the
plume
until
it
entered
a
plain
of
lava
filled
with
sharp
crags
yet
still
it
went
on
for
the
maiden
s
spirit
moved
over
the
barriers
as
lightly
as
the
down
of
dead
flowers
in
autumn
but
alas
the
young
man
had
to
seek
his
way
and
the
plume
again
left
him
far
behind
until
he
was
forced
to
cry
out
ah
my
beautiful
bride
do
wait
for
me
for
i
love
thee
and
will
not
turn
from
thee
then
the
plume
stopped
on
the
other
side
of
the
crags
and
waited
until
the
poor
young
man
came
nearer
his
feet
and
legs
cut
and
bleeding
and
his
wind
almost
out
then
the
trail
was
more
even
and
led
through
wide
plains
but
even
thus
the
young
man
could
scarce
keep
the
red
plume
in
sight
but
at
night
the
maiden
awaited
him
in
a
sheltered
place
and
they
rested
together
beneath
the
cedars
until
daylight
then
again
she
faded
out
in
the
daylight
and
the
red
plume
led
the
way
for
a
long
time
the
trail
was
pleasant
but
toward
evening
they
came
to
a
wide
bed
of
cactus
and
the
plume
passed
over
as
swiftly
as
ever
but
the
young
man
s
moccasins
were
soon
torn
and
his
feet
and
legs
cruelly
lacerated
with
the
cactus
spines
yet
still
he
pursued
the
red
plume
until
the
pain
seemed
to
sting
his
whole
body
and
he
gasped
and
wailed
ah
my
beautiful
wife
wait
for
me
do
wait
for
i
love
thee
and
will
not
leave
thee
then
the
plume
stopped
beyond
the
plain
of
cactus
and
waited
until
he
had
passed
through
but
not
longer
for
ere
he
had
plucked
all
the
needles
of
the
cactus
from
his
bleeding
feet
it
floated
on
and
he
lifted
himself
up
and
followed
until
at
evening
the
maiden
again
waited
and
bade
him
sit
down
and
that
night
she
seemed
to
pity
him
and
once
more
spoke
to
him
á
my
lover
my
husband
turn
back
oh
turn
back
for
the
way
is
long
and
untrodden
and
thy
heart
is
but
weak
and
is
mortal
i
go
to
the
council
of
dead
ones
and
how
can
the
living
there
enter
but
the
youth
only
wept
and
begged
that
she
let
him
go
with
her
for
ah
said
he
my
beautiful
wife
my
beautiful
bride
i
love
thee
and
can
not
turn
from
thee
and
she
smiled
only
and
shook
her
head
sadly
as
she
replied
á
it
shall
be
as
thou
willest
it
may
be
thy
heart
will
not
wither
for
tomorrow
is
one
more
day
onward
and
then
down
the
trail
to
the
waters
wherein
stands
the
ladder
of
others
shall
i
lead
thee
to
wait
me
at
on
the
day
after
the
plume
led
the
way
straight
to
a
deep
cañon
the
walls
of
which
were
so
steep
that
no
man
could
pass
them
alive
for
a
moment
the
red
plume
paused
above
the
chasm
and
the
youth
pressed
on
and
stretched
his
hand
forth
to
detain
it
but
ere
he
had
gained
the
spot
it
floated
on
straight
over
the
dark
cañon
as
though
no
ravine
had
been
there
at
all
for
to
spirits
the
trails
that
once
have
been
even
though
the
waters
have
worn
them
away
still
are
wildly
the
young
man
rushed
up
and
down
the
steep
brink
and
despairingly
he
called
across
to
the
plume
alas
ah
my
beautiful
wife
wait
only
wait
for
me
for
i
love
thee
and
can
not
turn
from
thee
then
like
one
whose
thoughts
wandered
he
threw
himself
over
the
brink
and
hung
by
his
hands
as
if
to
drop
when
a
jolly
little
striped
squirrel
who
was
playing
at
the
bottom
of
the
cañon
happened
to
see
him
and
called
out
tsithl
and
much
more
which
meant
hai
wananí
you
crazy
fool
of
a
being
you
have
not
the
wings
of
a
falcon
nor
the
hands
of
a
squirrel
nor
the
feet
of
a
spirit
and
if
you
drop
you
will
be
broken
to
pieces
and
the
moles
will
eat
up
the
fragments
wait
hold
hard
and
i
will
help
you
for
though
i
am
but
a
squirrel
i
know
how
to
think
whereupon
the
little
chit
ran
chattering
away
and
called
his
mate
out
of
their
house
in
a
wife
wife
come
quickly
run
to
our
corn
room
and
bring
me
a
hemlock
and
hurry
hurry
ask
me
no
questions
for
a
crazy
fool
of
a
man
over
here
will
break
himself
to
pieces
if
we
don
t
quickly
make
him
a
so
the
little
wife
flirted
her
brush
in
his
face
and
skipped
over
the
rocks
to
their
where
she
chose
a
fat
hemlock
and
hurried
to
her
husband
who
was
digging
a
hole
in
the
sand
underneath
where
the
young
man
was
hanging
then
they
spat
on
the
seed
and
buried
it
in
the
hole
and
began
to
dance
round
it
and
sing
tsilu
silokwe
silokwe
silokwe
silu
silu
tsithl
tsithl
which
meant
as
far
as
any
one
can
tell
now
for
it
was
a
long
time
ago
and
partly
squirrel
talk
hemlock
of
the
tall
kind
tall
kind
tall
kind
sprout
up
hemlock
hemlock
chit
chit
and
every
time
they
danced
around
and
sang
the
song
through
the
ground
moved
until
the
fourth
time
they
said
tsithl
the
tree
sprouted
forth
and
kept
growing
until
the
little
squirrel
could
jump
into
it
and
by
grabbing
the
topmost
bough
and
bracing
himself
against
the
branches
below
could
stretch
and
pull
it
so
that
in
a
short
time
he
made
it
grow
as
high
as
the
young
man
s
feet
and
he
had
all
he
could
do
to
keep
the
poor
youth
from
jumping
right
into
it
before
it
was
strong
enough
to
hold
him
presently
he
said
tsithl
and
whisked
away
before
the
young
man
had
time
to
thank
him
then
the
sad
lover
climbed
down
and
quickly
gained
the
other
side
which
was
not
so
steep
before
he
could
rest
from
his
climb
however
the
plume
floated
on
and
he
had
to
get
up
and
follow
it
just
as
the
sun
went
into
the
west
the
plume
hastened
down
into
a
valley
between
the
mountains
where
lay
a
beautiful
lake
and
around
the
borders
of
the
lake
a
very
ugly
old
man
and
woman
who
were
always
walking
back
and
forth
across
the
trails
came
forward
and
laughed
loudly
and
greeted
the
beautiful
maiden
pleasantly
then
they
told
her
to
enter
and
she
fearlessly
walked
into
the
water
and
a
ladder
of
flags
came
up
out
of
the
middle
of
the
lake
to
receive
her
down
which
she
stepped
without
stopping
until
she
passed
under
the
waters
for
a
little
and
then
all
was
over
a
bright
light
shone
out
of
the
water
and
the
sound
of
many
glad
voices
and
soft
merry
music
came
also
from
beneath
it
then
the
stars
of
the
sky
and
the
stars
of
the
waters
looked
the
same
at
each
other
as
they
had
done
before
alas
cried
the
young
man
as
he
ran
to
the
ah
my
beautiful
wife
my
beautiful
wife
only
wait
only
wait
that
i
may
go
with
thee
but
only
the
smooth
waters
and
the
old
man
and
woman
were
before
him
nor
did
the
ladder
come
out
or
the
old
ones
greet
him
so
he
sat
down
on
the
wringing
his
hands
and
weeping
and
ever
his
mind
wandered
back
to
his
old
lament
alas
alas
my
beautiful
bride
my
beautiful
wife
i
love
thee
i
loved
thee
but
i
knew
not
thee
and
killed
thee
toward
the
middle
of
the
night
once
more
he
heard
strange
happy
voices
the
doorway
to
the
land
of
spirits
opened
and
the
light
shot
up
through
the
dark
green
waters
from
many
windows
like
sparks
from
a
chimney
on
a
dark
windless
night
then
the
ladder
again
ascended
and
he
saw
the
forms
of
the
dead
pass
out
and
in
and
heard
the
sounds
of
the
as
it
danced
for
the
gods
the
comers
and
goers
were
bright
and
beautiful
but
their
garments
were
cotton
stitched
with
threads
and
their
necklaces
and
bracelets
were
of
dazzling
white
shells
and
turquoises
unnumbered
once
he
ventured
to
gain
the
bright
entrance
but
the
water
grew
deep
and
chilled
him
till
he
trembled
with
fear
and
cold
yet
he
looked
in
at
the
entrances
and
lo
as
he
gazed
he
caught
sight
of
his
beautiful
bride
all
covered
with
garments
and
bright
things
and
there
in
the
midst
of
the
she
sat
at
the
head
of
the
dancers
she
seemed
happy
and
smiled
as
she
watched
and
youths
as
bright
and
as
happy
came
around
her
and
she
seemed
to
forget
her
lone
lover
then
with
a
cry
of
despair
and
anguish
he
crawled
to
the
and
buried
his
face
in
the
sands
and
rank
grasses
suddenly
he
heard
a
low
screech
and
then
a
hoarse
voice
seemed
to
call
him
he
looked
and
a
great
owl
flew
over
him
saying
hu
hu
hu
hu
what
wilt
thou
he
cried
in
vexed
anguish
then
the
owl
flew
closer
and
lighting
asked
why
weepest
thou
my
child
he
turned
and
looked
at
the
owl
and
told
it
part
of
his
trouble
when
the
owl
suddenly
twisted
its
head
quite
around
as
owls
do
to
see
if
anyone
were
near
then
came
closer
and
said
i
know
all
about
it
young
man
come
with
me
to
my
house
in
the
mountain
and
if
thou
wilt
but
follow
my
counsel
all
will
yet
be
then
the
owl
led
the
way
to
a
cave
far
above
and
bade
him
step
in
as
he
placed
his
foot
inside
the
opening
behold
it
widened
into
a
bright
room
and
many
and
around
greeted
him
happily
and
bade
him
sit
down
and
eat
the
old
owl
who
had
brought
him
changed
himself
in
a
twinkling
as
he
entered
the
room
and
hung
his
on
an
antler
then
he
went
away
but
presently
returned
bringing
a
little
bag
of
medicine
before
i
give
thee
this
let
me
tell
thee
what
to
do
and
what
thou
must
promise
said
he
of
the
the
young
man
eagerly
reached
forth
his
hand
for
the
magic
medicine
fool
cried
the
being
were
it
not
well
for
that
would
i
not
help
thee
thou
art
too
eager
and
i
will
not
trust
thee
with
my
medicine
of
sleep
thou
shalt
sleep
here
and
when
thou
awakest
thou
shalt
find
the
morning
star
in
the
sky
and
thy
dead
wife
before
thee
on
the
trail
toward
the
middle
ant
hill
with
the
rising
sun
she
will
wake
and
smile
on
thee
be
not
foolish
but
journey
preciously
with
her
and
not
until
ye
reach
the
home
of
thy
fathers
shalt
thou
approach
her
or
kiss
her
for
if
thou
doest
this
all
will
be
as
nothing
again
but
if
thou
doest
as
i
counsel
thee
all
will
be
well
and
happily
may
ye
live
one
with
the
he
ceased
and
taking
a
tiny
pinch
of
the
medicine
blew
it
in
the
face
of
the
youth
instantly
the
young
man
sank
with
sleep
where
he
had
been
sitting
and
the
beings
putting
on
their
flew
away
with
him
under
some
trees
by
the
trail
that
led
to
mátsaki
and
the
ant
hill
of
the
middle
then
they
flew
over
the
lake
and
threw
the
medicine
of
sleep
in
at
the
windows
and
taking
the
plumed
which
the
young
man
had
brought
with
him
they
chose
some
red
plumes
for
themselves
and
with
the
others
entered
the
home
of
the
softly
they
flew
over
the
sleeping
fathers
and
their
children
the
gods
of
the
and
the
spirits
and
laying
the
before
the
great
altar
caught
up
the
beautiful
maiden
and
bore
her
over
the
waters
and
woodlands
to
where
the
young
man
was
still
sleeping
then
they
hooted
and
flew
off
to
their
mountain
as
the
great
star
came
out
of
the
the
young
man
awoke
and
lo
there
before
him
lay
his
own
beautiful
wife
then
he
turned
his
face
away
that
he
might
not
be
tempted
and
waited
with
joy
and
longing
for
the
coming
out
of
the
sun
when
at
last
the
sun
came
out
with
the
first
ray
that
brightened
the
beautiful
maiden
s
face
she
opened
her
eyes
and
gazed
wildly
around
at
first
but
seeing
her
lonely
lover
smiled
and
said
truly
thou
lovest
me
then
they
arose
and
journeyed
apart
toward
the
home
of
their
fathers
and
the
young
man
forgot
not
the
counsel
of
the
owl
but
journeyed
wisely
till
on
the
fourth
day
they
came
in
sight
of
the
mountain
of
thunder
and
saw
the
river
that
flows
by
salt
city
as
they
began
to
go
down
into
the
valley
the
maiden
stopped
and
said
i
am
weary
for
the
journey
is
long
and
the
day
is
then
she
sat
down
in
the
shadow
of
a
cedar
and
said
watch
my
husband
while
i
sleep
a
little
only
a
little
and
then
we
will
journey
together
and
he
said
be
it
then
she
lay
down
and
seemed
to
sleep
she
smiled
and
looked
so
beautiful
to
the
longing
lover
that
he
softly
rose
and
crept
close
to
her
then
alas
he
laid
his
hand
upon
her
and
kissed
her
quickly
the
beautiful
maiden
started
her
face
was
all
covered
with
sadness
and
she
said
hastily
and
angrily
ah
thou
shameless
fool
i
now
know
thou
lovest
me
not
how
vain
that
i
should
have
hoped
for
thy
love
with
shame
indeed
and
sorrow
he
bent
his
head
low
and
covered
his
face
with
his
hands
then
he
started
to
speak
when
an
owl
flew
up
and
hooted
mournfully
at
him
from
a
then
the
owl
winged
her
way
to
the
westward
and
ever
after
the
young
man
s
mind
wandered
alas
alas
thus
it
was
in
the
days
of
the
ancients
maybe
had
the
young
man
not
kissed
her
yonder
toward
the
lake
of
the
dead
we
would
never
have
journeyed
nor
ever
have
mourned
for
others
lost
but
then
it
is
well
if
men
and
women
had
never
died
then
the
world
long
ago
had
overflown
with
children
starvation
and
warring
thus
shortens
my
story
illustration
a
young
man
and
young
woman
the
youth
and
his
eagle
in
forgotten
times
in
the
days
of
our
ancients
at
the
middle
place
or
what
is
now
shíwina
zuñi
there
lived
a
youth
who
was
well
grown
or
perfect
in
manhood
he
had
a
pet
eagle
which
he
kept
in
a
cage
down
on
the
roof
of
the
first
terrace
of
the
house
of
his
family
he
loved
this
eagle
so
dearly
that
he
could
not
endure
to
be
separated
from
it
not
only
this
but
he
spent
nearly
all
his
time
in
caring
for
and
fondling
his
pet
morning
noon
and
evening
yea
and
even
between
those
times
you
would
see
him
going
down
to
the
with
meat
and
other
kinds
of
delicate
food
day
after
day
there
you
would
find
him
sitting
beside
the
eagle
petting
it
and
making
affectionate
speeches
to
all
of
which
treatment
the
bird
responded
with
a
most
satisfied
air
and
seemed
equally
fond
of
his
owner
illustration
the
youth
and
his
eagle
photo
by
hillers
whenever
a
storm
came
the
youth
would
hasten
out
of
the
house
as
though
the
safety
of
the
crops
depended
upon
it
to
protect
the
eagle
so
winter
and
summer
no
other
care
occupied
his
attention
and
was
this
bird
to
this
youth
so
much
so
that
his
brothers
elder
and
younger
and
his
male
relatives
generally
looked
down
upon
him
as
negligent
of
all
manly
duties
and
wasteful
of
their
substance
which
he
helped
not
to
earn
in
his
excessive
care
of
the
bird
naturally
therefore
they
looked
with
aversion
upon
the
eagle
and
one
evening
after
a
hard
day
s
work
after
remonstrances
with
the
youth
for
not
joining
in
their
labors
they
returned
home
tired
and
out
of
humor
and
climbing
the
ladder
of
the
lower
terrace
passed
the
great
cage
on
their
way
into
the
upper
house
they
stopped
a
moment
before
entering
and
one
of
the
eldest
of
the
party
exclaimed
we
have
remonstrated
in
vain
with
the
younger
brother
we
have
represented
his
duties
to
him
in
every
possible
light
yet
without
effect
what
remains
to
be
done
what
plans
can
we
devise
to
alienate
him
from
this
miserable
eagle
why
not
kill
the
wretched
bird
asked
one
of
them
that
i
should
say
would
be
the
most
simple
means
of
curing
him
of
his
that
is
an
excellent
plan
exclaimed
all
of
the
brothers
as
they
went
on
into
the
house
we
must
adopt
the
eagle
apparently
so
unconscious
heard
all
this
and
pondered
over
it
presently
came
the
youth
with
meat
and
other
delicate
food
for
his
beloved
bird
and
opening
the
wicket
of
the
gate
placed
it
within
and
bade
the
eagle
eat
but
the
bird
looked
at
him
and
at
the
food
with
no
apparent
interest
and
lowering
its
head
on
its
breast
sat
moody
and
silent
are
you
ill
my
beloved
eagle
asked
the
youth
or
why
is
it
that
you
do
not
eat
i
do
not
care
to
eat
said
the
eagle
speaking
for
the
first
time
i
am
oppressed
with
much
do
eat
my
beloved
eagle
said
the
youth
why
should
you
be
sad
have
i
neglected
you
no
indeed
you
have
not
said
the
eagle
for
this
reason
i
love
you
as
you
love
me
for
this
reason
i
prize
and
cherish
you
as
you
cherish
me
and
yet
it
is
for
this
very
reason
that
i
am
sad
look
you
your
brothers
and
relatives
have
often
remonstrated
with
you
for
your
neglect
of
their
fields
and
your
care
for
me
they
have
often
been
angered
with
you
for
not
bearing
your
part
in
the
duties
of
the
household
therefore
it
is
that
they
look
with
reproach
upon
you
and
with
aversion
upon
me
so
much
so
that
they
have
at
last
determined
to
destroy
me
in
order
to
do
away
with
your
affection
for
me
and
to
withdraw
your
attention
for
this
reason
i
am
sad
not
that
they
can
harm
me
for
i
need
but
spread
my
wings
when
the
wicket
is
opened
and
what
can
they
do
but
i
would
not
part
from
you
for
i
love
you
i
would
not
that
you
should
part
with
me
for
you
love
me
therefore
am
i
sad
for
i
must
go
tomorrow
to
my
home
in
the
skies
said
the
eagle
again
relapsing
into
moody
silence
oh
my
beloved
bird
my
own
dear
eagle
how
could
i
live
without
you
how
could
i
remain
behind
when
you
went
forward
below
when
you
went
upward
exclaimed
the
youth
already
beginning
to
weep
no
go
go
if
it
need
be
alas
but
let
me
go
with
you
said
the
youth
my
friend
my
poor
poor
youth
said
the
eagle
you
can
not
go
with
me
you
have
not
wings
to
fly
nor
have
you
knowledge
to
guide
your
course
through
the
high
skies
into
other
worlds
that
you
know
not
let
me
go
with
you
cried
the
youth
falling
on
his
knees
by
the
side
of
the
cage
i
will
comfort
you
i
will
care
for
you
even
as
i
have
done
here
but
live
without
you
i
can
not
ah
my
youth
said
the
eagle
i
would
that
you
could
go
with
me
but
the
end
would
not
be
well
you
know
not
how
little
you
love
me
that
you
wish
to
do
this
thing
think
for
a
moment
the
foods
that
my
people
eat
are
not
the
foods
of
your
people
they
are
not
ripened
by
fire
for
our
consumption
but
whatever
we
capture
abroad
on
our
measureless
hunts
we
devour
as
it
is
asking
no
fire
to
render
it
palatable
or
wholesome
you
could
not
exist
my
eagle
my
eagle
cried
the
youth
if
i
were
to
remain
behind
when
you
went
forward
or
below
when
you
went
upward
food
would
be
as
nothing
to
me
and
were
it
not
better
that
i
should
eat
raw
food
or
no
food
than
that
i
should
stay
here
excessively
and
sadly
thinking
of
you
and
thus
never
eat
at
all
even
of
the
food
of
my
own
people
no
let
me
go
with
you
once
more
i
implore
you
my
youth
said
the
eagle
not
to
go
with
me
for
to
your
own
undoing
and
to
my
sadness
will
such
a
journey
be
let
me
go
let
me
go
only
let
me
go
implored
the
youth
it
is
said
replied
the
eagle
calmly
even
as
you
wish
so
be
it
now
go
unto
your
own
home
for
the
last
time
gather
large
quantities
of
sustaining
food
as
for
a
long
journey
place
this
food
in
strong
pouches
and
make
them
all
into
a
package
which
you
can
sling
upon
your
shoulder
or
back
then
come
to
me
tomorrow
morning
after
the
people
have
begun
to
descend
to
their
the
youth
bade
to
his
eagle
and
went
into
the
house
he
took
of
parched
flour
a
great
quantity
of
dried
and
pulverized
a
large
bag
and
of
other
foods
such
as
hunters
carry
and
on
which
they
sustain
themselves
long
he
took
a
good
supply
and
made
them
all
into
a
firm
package
then
with
high
hopes
and
much
thought
of
the
morrow
he
laid
himself
to
rest
he
slept
late
into
the
morning
and
it
was
not
until
his
brothers
had
departed
for
their
fields
of
corn
that
he
arose
and
eating
a
hasty
breakfast
slung
the
package
of
foods
over
his
shoulders
and
descended
to
the
cage
of
the
eagle
the
great
bird
was
waiting
for
him
with
a
smile
in
its
eyes
it
came
forth
when
he
opened
the
wicket
and
settling
down
on
the
ground
spread
out
its
wings
and
bade
the
youth
mount
sit
on
my
back
for
it
is
strong
oh
youth
grasp
the
base
of
my
wings
and
rest
your
feet
above
my
thighs
that
you
may
not
fall
off
are
you
ready
ah
well
and
have
you
all
needful
things
in
the
way
of
food
good
let
us
start
on
our
saying
this
the
eagle
rose
slowly
circling
wider
and
wider
as
it
went
up
and
higher
and
higher
until
it
had
risen
far
above
the
town
going
slowly
presently
it
said
my
youth
i
will
sing
a
farewell
song
to
your
people
for
you
and
for
me
that
they
may
know
of
our
final
then
as
with
great
sweeps
of
its
wings
it
circled
round
and
round
going
higher
and
higher
it
sang
this
song
pa
shish
pa
shish
as
the
song
floated
down
from
on
high
save
us
by
our
eyes
exclaimed
the
people
the
eagle
and
the
youth
they
are
escaping
they
are
leaving
us
and
so
the
word
went
from
mouth
to
mouth
and
from
ear
to
ear
until
the
whole
town
was
gazing
at
the
eagle
and
the
youth
and
the
song
died
away
in
the
distance
and
the
eagle
became
smaller
and
smaller
winding
its
way
upward
until
it
was
a
mere
speck
and
finally
vanished
in
the
very
zenith
the
people
shook
their
heads
and
resumed
their
work
but
the
eagle
and
the
youth
went
on
until
at
last
they
came
to
the
great
opening
in
the
zenith
of
the
sky
in
passing
upward
by
its
endless
cliffs
they
came
out
on
the
other
side
into
the
and
still
upward
soared
the
eagle
until
it
alighted
with
its
beloved
burden
on
the
summit
of
the
mountain
of
turquoises
so
blue
that
the
light
shining
on
it
paints
the
sky
blue
said
the
eagle
with
the
weariness
that
comes
at
the
end
of
a
long
journey
we
have
reached
our
journey
s
end
for
a
time
let
us
rest
ourselves
on
this
mountain
height
of
my
beloved
the
youth
descended
and
sat
by
the
eagle
s
side
and
the
eagle
raising
its
wings
until
the
tips
touched
above
lowered
its
head
and
catching
hold
of
its
crown
shook
it
from
side
to
side
and
then
drew
upon
it
and
then
gradually
the
parted
and
while
the
youth
looked
and
wondered
in
love
and
joy
a
beautiful
maiden
was
uncovered
before
him
in
garments
of
dazzling
whiteness
softness
and
beauty
no
more
beautiful
maiden
could
be
conceived
than
this
one
bright
of
face
clear
and
clean
with
eyes
so
dark
and
large
and
deep
and
yet
sharp
that
it
was
bewildering
to
look
into
them
such
eyes
have
never
been
seen
in
this
world
come
with
me
my
youth
you
who
have
loved
me
so
well
said
she
approaching
him
and
reaching
out
her
hand
let
us
wander
for
a
while
on
this
mountain
side
and
seek
the
home
of
my
they
descended
the
mountain
and
wound
round
its
foot
until
looking
up
in
the
clear
light
of
the
they
beheld
a
city
such
as
no
man
has
ever
seen
lofty
were
its
walls
smooth
gleaming
clean
and
white
no
ladders
no
smoke
no
filth
in
any
part
whatsoever
yonder
is
the
home
of
my
people
said
the
maiden
and
resuming
her
she
took
the
youth
on
her
back
again
and
circling
upward
hovered
for
a
moment
over
this
home
of
the
eagles
then
through
one
of
the
wide
entrances
which
were
in
the
roof
slowly
descended
no
ladders
were
there
inside
or
outside
no
need
of
them
with
a
people
winged
like
the
eagles
for
a
people
they
were
like
ourselves
more
a
people
indeed
than
we
for
in
one
guise
or
the
other
they
might
appear
at
will
no
sooner
had
the
and
the
youth
entered
this
great
building
than
those
who
were
assembled
there
greeted
them
with
welcome
assurances
of
joy
at
their
coming
sit
ye
down
and
rest
said
they
the
youth
looked
around
the
great
room
into
which
they
had
descended
was
high
and
broad
and
long
and
lighted
from
many
windows
in
its
roof
and
upon
its
walls
which
were
beautifully
white
and
clean
and
finished
as
no
walls
in
this
world
are
with
many
devices
pleasing
to
the
eye
starting
out
from
these
walls
were
many
hooks
or
pegs
suspended
from
which
were
the
dresses
of
the
eagles
who
lived
there
the
forms
of
which
we
know
yea
sit
ye
down
and
rest
and
be
happy
said
an
old
man
wonderfully
fine
he
was
as
he
arose
and
approached
the
couple
and
said
spreading
abroad
his
wings
be
ye
always
one
to
the
other
wife
and
husband
shall
it
be
so
and
they
both
smiling
said
and
so
the
youth
married
the
after
a
few
days
of
rest
they
found
him
an
fine
as
the
finest
with
broad
strong
wings
and
beautiful
plumage
and
they
taught
him
how
to
conform
himself
to
it
and
it
to
himself
and
as
eagles
would
teach
a
young
eagle
here
in
this
world
of
ours
so
they
taught
the
youth
gradually
to
fly
at
first
they
would
bid
him
poise
himself
in
his
on
the
floor
of
their
great
room
and
laying
all
over
it
soft
things
bid
him
open
his
wings
and
leap
into
the
air
anxious
to
learn
he
would
spread
his
great
wings
and
with
a
powerful
effort
send
himself
high
up
toward
the
ceiling
but
untaught
to
sustain
himself
there
would
fall
with
many
a
flap
and
tumble
to
the
floor
again
and
again
this
was
tried
but
after
a
while
he
learned
to
sustain
and
guide
himself
almost
wholly
round
the
room
without
once
touching
anything
and
his
wife
in
her
would
fly
around
him
watching
and
helping
and
whenever
his
flight
wavered
would
fan
a
strong
wind
up
against
his
wings
with
her
own
that
he
might
not
falter
until
he
had
at
last
learned
wholly
to
support
himself
in
the
air
then
she
bade
him
one
day
come
out
with
her
to
the
roof
of
the
house
and
from
there
they
sailed
away
away
and
away
over
the
great
valleys
and
plains
below
ever
keeping
to
the
northward
and
eastward
and
whenever
he
faltered
in
his
flight
she
bore
his
wings
up
with
her
own
wings
teaching
him
how
this
way
and
that
until
when
they
returned
to
the
roof
those
who
watched
them
said
now
indeed
is
he
learned
in
the
ways
of
our
people
how
good
it
is
that
this
is
so
and
they
were
very
happy
the
youth
and
the
and
their
people
one
day
the
maiden
took
the
youth
out
again
into
the
surrounding
country
and
as
they
flew
along
she
said
to
him
you
may
wonder
that
we
never
fly
toward
the
southward
oh
my
youth
my
husband
never
go
yonder
for
over
that
low
range
of
mountains
is
a
fearful
world
where
no
mortal
can
venture
if
you
love
me
oh
if
you
truly
love
me
never
venture
yonder
and
he
listened
to
her
advice
and
promised
that
he
would
not
go
there
then
they
went
home
one
day
there
was
a
grand
hunt
and
he
was
invited
to
join
in
it
over
the
wide
world
flew
this
band
of
eagle
hunters
to
plains
whatsoever
they
would
hunt
behold
below
them
somewhere
or
other
might
the
game
be
seen
were
it
rabbit
mountain
sheep
antelope
or
deer
and
each
according
to
his
wish
captured
the
kind
of
game
he
would
the
youth
bringing
home
with
the
rest
his
quarry
of
all
the
game
they
captured
he
could
eat
none
for
in
that
great
house
of
the
eagles
so
beautiful
so
perfect
no
fire
ever
burned
no
cooking
was
ever
done
and
after
many
days
the
food
which
the
youth
brought
with
him
was
diminished
so
that
his
wife
took
him
out
to
a
high
mountain
one
day
and
said
as
i
have
told
you
before
the
region
beyond
those
low
mountains
is
fearful
and
deadly
but
yonder
in
the
east
are
other
kinds
of
people
than
those
whom
you
should
dread
not
far
away
is
the
home
of
the
pelicans
and
storks
who
as
you
know
eat
food
that
has
been
cooked
even
as
your
people
do
when
you
grow
hungry
my
husband
go
to
them
and
as
they
are
your
grandparents
they
will
feed
you
and
give
you
of
their
abundance
of
food
that
you
may
bring
it
here
and
thus
we
shall
do
well
and
be
the
youth
assented
and
guided
part
of
the
way
by
his
faithful
loving
wife
he
went
to
the
home
of
the
storks
no
sooner
had
he
appeared
than
they
greeted
him
with
loud
assurances
of
welcome
and
pleasure
at
his
coming
and
bade
him
eat
and
they
set
before
him
beans
which
were
baked
as
it
were
and
mushes
of
beans
with
meat
intermixed
which
seemed
as
well
cooked
as
the
foods
of
our
own
people
here
on
this
mortal
earth
and
the
youth
ate
part
of
them
and
with
many
thanks
returned
to
his
home
among
the
eagles
and
thus
as
his
wife
had
said
before
it
was
all
well
and
they
continued
to
live
there
happily
this
curious
conception
of
the
food
of
the
storks
and
cranes
and
pelicans
for
of
such
birds
the
tells
is
interesting
it
is
doubtless
an
attempt
to
explain
what
has
been
observed
with
relation
to
the
pelicans
and
the
storks
especially
that
they
consume
their
food
raw
and
as
the
indian
believes
cook
it
as
it
were
in
their
own
bodies
and
then
withdraw
it
either
for
their
young
or
for
their
final
consumption
as
this
food
of
such
birds
resembles
very
nearly
the
thick
bean
stews
of
the
zuñis
they
have
evidently
taken
from
it
the
suggestion
for
the
special
kinds
of
food
which
were
offered
to
the
youth
between
the
villages
of
the
eagles
and
the
storks
the
youth
lived
so
that
the
storks
became
almost
as
fond
of
him
as
were
the
eagles
addressing
him
as
their
beloved
grandchild
and
in
consequence
of
this
fondness
his
old
grandfather
and
grandmother
among
the
storks
especially
called
his
attention
to
the
fearful
region
lying
beyond
the
range
of
mountains
to
the
south
and
they
implored
him
as
his
wife
had
done
not
to
go
thither
for
the
love
of
us
do
not
go
there
oh
grandchild
said
they
one
day
when
he
was
about
to
leave
he
seemed
to
agree
with
them
and
spread
his
wings
and
flew
away
but
when
he
had
gone
a
long
distance
he
turned
southward
with
this
exclamation
why
should
i
not
see
what
this
is
who
can
harm
me
floating
on
these
strong
wings
of
mine
who
can
harm
an
eagle
in
the
sky
so
he
flew
over
the
edge
of
the
mountains
and
behold
rising
up
on
the
plains
beyond
them
was
a
great
city
fine
and
perfect
with
walls
of
stone
built
as
are
the
towns
of
our
dead
ancients
and
the
smoke
was
wreathing
forth
from
its
chimneys
and
in
the
hazy
distance
it
seemed
teeming
with
life
at
the
moment
when
the
youth
saw
it
which
was
at
evening
time
the
inhabitants
of
that
city
saw
him
and
sent
messages
forth
to
the
town
of
the
eagles
that
they
would
make
a
grand
festival
and
dance
and
invited
the
eagles
to
come
with
their
friends
to
witness
this
dance
and
when
the
youth
returned
to
the
home
of
his
eagle
people
behold
already
had
this
message
been
delivered
there
and
his
wife
in
sorrow
was
awaiting
him
at
the
doorway
alas
alas
my
youth
my
husband
said
she
and
so
regarding
more
your
own
curiosity
than
the
love
of
your
wife
you
have
been
into
that
fearful
country
and
as
might
have
been
expected
you
were
observed
we
are
now
invited
to
visit
the
city
you
saw
and
to
witness
a
dance
of
the
inhabitants
thereof
which
invitation
we
can
not
refuse
and
you
must
go
with
us
it
remains
to
be
seen
oh
my
youth
whom
i
trusted
if
your
love
for
me
be
so
great
that
you
may
stand
the
test
of
this
which
you
have
brought
upon
yourself
by
heedlessness
of
my
advice
and
that
of
your
grandparents
the
storks
oh
my
husband
i
despair
of
you
and
thus
despairing
i
implore
you
to
heed
me
once
more
and
all
may
be
well
with
you
even
yet
go
with
us
tonight
to
the
city
you
saw
the
most
fearful
of
all
cities
for
it
is
the
city
of
the
damned
and
wonderful
things
you
will
see
but
do
not
laugh
or
even
smile
once
i
will
sit
by
your
side
and
look
at
you
oh
think
of
me
as
i
do
of
you
and
thus
thinking
you
will
not
smile
if
you
truly
love
me
and
would
remain
with
me
always
and
be
happy
as
i
would
be
happy
do
this
one
thing
for
the
youth
promised
over
and
over
and
when
night
came
he
went
with
the
eagle
people
to
that
city
a
beautiful
place
it
was
large
and
fine
with
high
walls
of
stone
and
many
a
little
window
out
of
which
the
red
was
shining
the
smoke
was
going
up
from
its
chimneys
the
sparks
winding
up
through
it
and
with
beacon
fires
burning
on
the
roofs
it
was
a
happy
bustling
scene
that
met
the
gaze
of
the
youth
as
he
approached
the
town
there
were
sounds
and
cries
of
life
everywhere
lights
shone
and
merriment
echoed
from
every
street
and
room
and
they
were
ushered
into
a
great
dance
hall
or
where
the
audience
was
already
assembled
the
sounds
of
the
coming
dance
were
heard
and
all
was
expectation
the
fires
blazed
up
and
the
lights
shone
all
round
the
room
making
it
as
bright
as
day
in
came
the
dancers
maidens
mostly
beautiful
and
clad
in
the
richest
of
ancient
garments
their
eyes
were
bright
their
hair
black
and
soft
their
faces
gleaming
with
merriment
and
pleasure
and
they
came
joking
down
the
ladders
into
the
room
before
the
place
where
the
youth
sat
and
as
they
danced
down
the
middle
of
the
floor
they
cried
out
in
shrill
yet
not
unpleasant
voices
as
they
jostled
each
other
playing
grotesque
pranks
and
assuming
the
most
attitudes
hapa
is
is
is
dead
dead
this
this
this
pointing
at
one
another
and
repeating
this
baleful
expression
although
so
beautiful
and
full
of
life
and
joy
and
merriment
now
the
youth
looked
at
them
all
through
this
long
dance
and
though
he
thought
it
strange
that
they
should
exclaim
thus
one
to
another
so
lively
and
pretty
and
jolly
they
were
he
was
nevertheless
filled
with
amusement
at
their
strange
antics
and
wordless
jokes
still
he
never
smiled
then
they
filed
in
again
and
there
were
more
dancers
merrier
than
before
and
among
them
were
two
or
three
girls
of
surpassing
beauty
even
in
that
throng
of
lovely
women
and
one
of
them
looked
in
a
coquettish
manner
constantly
toward
the
youth
directing
all
her
smiles
and
merriment
to
him
as
she
pointed
round
to
her
companions
exclaiming
hapa
is
is
is
the
youth
grew
forgetful
of
everything
else
as
he
leaned
forward
absorbed
in
watching
this
girl
with
her
bright
eyes
and
merry
smiles
when
finally
in
a
more
amusing
manner
than
before
she
jostled
some
merry
dancer
he
laughed
outright
and
the
girl
ran
forward
toward
him
with
two
others
following
and
reaching
out
grasped
his
hands
and
dragged
him
into
the
dance
the
lifted
her
wings
and
with
a
cry
of
woe
flew
away
with
her
people
but
ah
ah
the
youth
minded
nothing
he
was
so
wild
with
merriment
like
the
beautiful
maidens
by
his
side
and
up
and
down
the
great
lighted
hall
he
danced
with
them
joining
in
their
uncouth
postures
and
their
exclamations
of
which
he
did
not
yet
understand
the
true
meaning
hapa
is
is
is
the
fire
began
to
burn
low
and
the
maidens
said
to
him
come
and
pass
the
night
with
us
all
here
why
go
back
to
your
home
are
we
not
merry
companions
ha
ha
ha
ha
hapa
is
is
is
they
began
to
laugh
and
jostle
one
another
again
thus
they
led
the
youth
not
unwillingly
on
his
part
away
into
a
room
large
and
fine
like
the
others
and
there
on
soft
blankets
he
lay
himself
down
and
these
maidens
gathered
round
him
one
pillowing
his
head
on
her
arm
another
smiling
down
into
his
face
another
sitting
by
his
side
and
soon
he
fell
asleep
all
became
silent
and
the
youth
slept
on
in
the
morning
when
broad
daylight
had
come
the
youth
opened
his
eyes
and
started
it
seemed
as
though
there
were
more
light
than
there
should
be
in
the
house
he
looked
up
and
the
room
which
had
been
so
fine
and
finished
the
night
before
was
tottering
over
his
head
the
winds
shrieked
through
great
crevices
in
the
walls
the
windows
were
broken
and
wide
open
sand
sifted
through
on
the
wind
and
eddied
down
into
the
old
barren
room
the
rafters
dried
and
warped
with
age
were
bending
and
breaking
and
pieces
of
the
roof
fell
now
and
then
when
the
wind
blew
more
strongly
he
raised
himself
and
clammy
bones
fell
from
around
him
and
when
he
cast
his
eyes
about
him
there
on
the
floor
were
strewn
bones
and
skulls
here
and
there
a
face
half
buried
in
the
sand
with
eyes
sunken
and
dried
and
patches
of
skin
clinging
to
it
seemed
to
glare
at
him
fingers
and
feet
as
of
mummies
were
strewn
about
and
it
was
as
if
the
youth
had
entered
a
great
cemetery
where
the
remains
of
the
dead
of
all
ages
were
littered
about
he
lifted
himself
still
farther
and
where
the
head
of
one
maiden
had
lain
or
the
arms
of
another
had
entwined
with
his
bones
were
clinging
to
him
one
by
one
he
picked
them
off
stealthily
and
laid
them
down
until
at
last
he
freed
himself
and
rising
cautiously
stepped
between
the
bones
which
were
lying
around
making
no
noise
until
he
came
to
the
doorway
of
the
place
there
as
he
passed
out
his
foot
tripped
against
a
splinter
of
bone
which
was
embedded
in
the
debris
of
the
ruin
and
as
a
sliver
sings
in
the
wind
so
this
sang
out
the
youth
startled
and
terrorized
sprang
forth
and
ran
for
his
life
in
the
direction
of
the
home
of
the
storks
shrieking
howling
and
singing
like
a
slivered
stick
in
the
wind
like
creaking
boughs
in
the
forest
with
groans
and
howls
and
whistlings
that
seemed
to
freeze
the
youth
as
he
ran
these
bones
and
fragments
of
the
dead
arose
and
like
a
flock
of
vampires
pursued
him
noisily
he
ran
and
ran
and
the
great
cloud
of
the
dead
were
coming
nearer
and
nearer
and
pressing
round
him
when
he
beheld
one
of
his
grandparents
a
badger
near
its
hole
the
badger
followed
by
others
was
fast
approaching
him
having
heard
this
fearful
clamor
and
cried
out
our
grandson
let
s
save
him
so
they
ran
forward
and
catching
him
up
cast
him
down
into
one
of
their
holes
then
turning
toward
the
uncanny
crowd
and
bristling
up
with
sudden
emotion
and
mighty
effort
they
cast
off
that
odor
by
which
as
you
know
they
may
defile
the
very
winds
it
met
the
crowd
of
ghosts
the
whole
host
of
them
turned
with
wails
and
howls
and
gnashings
of
teeth
back
toward
the
city
of
the
dead
whence
they
had
come
and
the
badgers
ran
into
the
hole
where
lay
the
youth
lifted
him
up
and
scolded
him
most
vigorously
for
his
folly
then
they
said
sit
up
you
fool
for
you
are
not
yet
saved
hurry
said
they
one
to
another
heat
water
and
the
water
being
heated
nauseating
herbs
and
other
medicines
were
mingled
with
it
and
the
youth
was
directed
to
drink
of
that
he
drank
not
once
but
four
times
usa
and
after
he
had
been
thus
treated
the
old
badgers
asked
him
if
he
felt
relieved
or
well
and
the
youth
said
he
was
very
well
compared
with
what
he
had
been
then
they
stood
him
up
in
their
midst
and
said
to
him
you
fool
and
faithless
lout
why
did
you
go
and
become
enamored
of
death
however
beautiful
it
is
only
a
wonder
that
with
all
our
skill
and
power
we
have
saved
you
thus
far
it
will
be
a
still
greater
wonder
o
foolish
one
if
she
who
loved
you
still
loves
you
enough
after
this
faithlessness
to
save
the
life
which
you
have
forfeited
who
would
dance
and
take
joy
in
death
go
now
to
the
home
of
your
grandparents
the
storks
and
there
live
your
plumage
gone
your
love
given
up
what
remains
you
can
neither
descend
to
your
own
people
below
without
wings
nor
can
you
live
with
the
people
of
the
eagles
without
love
go
therefore
to
your
grandparents
and
the
youth
got
up
and
dragged
himself
away
to
the
home
of
the
storks
but
when
he
arrived
there
they
looked
at
him
with
downcast
faces
and
reproached
him
over
and
over
saying
there
is
small
possibility
of
your
regaining
what
you
have
forfeited
the
love
and
affection
of
your
but
i
will
go
to
her
and
plead
with
her
said
the
youth
how
should
i
know
what
i
was
doing
we
told
you
not
to
do
it
and
you
heeded
not
our
so
the
youth
lagged
away
to
the
home
of
the
eagles
where
outside
that
great
house
with
high
walls
he
lingered
moping
and
moaning
the
eagles
came
and
went
or
they
gathered
and
talked
on
the
but
no
word
of
greeting
did
they
offer
him
and
his
wife
at
last
with
a
shiver
of
disgust
appeared
above
him
and
said
go
back
go
back
to
your
grandparents
their
love
you
may
not
have
forfeited
mine
you
have
go
back
for
we
never
can
receive
you
again
amongst
us
oh
folly
and
faithlessness
in
you
they
have
an
example
so
the
youth
sadly
returned
to
the
home
of
the
storks
there
he
lingered
returning
ever
and
anon
to
the
home
of
the
eagles
but
it
was
as
though
he
were
not
there
until
at
last
the
elder
eagles
during
one
of
his
absences
implored
the
to
take
the
youth
back
to
his
own
home
would
you
ask
me
his
wife
who
loved
him
now
to
touch
him
who
has
been
polluted
by
being
enamored
of
death
asked
she
but
they
implored
and
she
acquiesced
so
when
the
youth
appeared
again
at
the
home
of
the
eagles
she
had
found
an
old
old
eagle
dress
many
of
the
feathers
in
it
broken
ragged
and
disreputable
it
was
and
the
were
so
thin
that
the
wind
whistled
through
them
descending
with
this
she
bade
him
put
it
on
and
when
he
had
done
so
she
said
come
with
me
now
according
to
the
knowledge
in
which
we
have
instructed
and
they
flew
away
to
the
summit
of
that
blue
mountain
and
after
resting
there
they
began
to
descend
into
the
sky
which
we
see
and
from
that
downward
and
downward
in
very
narrow
circles
whenever
the
youth
with
his
wings
faltered
the
wife
bore
him
up
until
growing
weary
in
a
moment
of
remembrance
of
his
faithlessness
she
caught
in
her
talons
the
eagle
dress
which
sustained
him
and
drew
it
off
bade
him
farewell
forever
and
sailed
away
out
of
sight
in
the
sky
and
the
youth
with
one
gasp
and
shriek
tumbled
over
and
over
and
over
fell
into
the
very
center
of
the
town
in
which
he
had
lived
when
he
loved
his
eagle
and
utterly
perished
thus
it
was
in
the
times
of
the
ancients
and
for
this
reason
by
no
means
whatsoever
may
a
mortal
man
by
any
alliances
under
the
sun
avoid
death
but
if
one
would
live
as
long
as
possible
one
should
never
in
any
manner
whatsoever
remembering
this
youth
s
experience
become
enamored
of
death
thus
shortens
my
story
illustration
bird
symbols
the
poor
turkey
girl
long
long
ago
our
ancients
had
neither
sheep
nor
horses
nor
cattle
yet
they
had
domestic
animals
of
various
kinds
amongst
them
turkeys
in
mátsaki
or
the
salt
city
there
dwelt
at
this
time
many
very
wealthy
families
who
possessed
large
flocks
of
these
birds
which
it
was
their
custom
to
have
their
slaves
or
the
poor
people
of
the
town
herd
in
the
plains
round
about
thunder
mountain
below
which
their
town
stood
and
on
the
mesas
beyond
now
in
mátsaki
at
this
time
there
stood
away
out
near
the
border
of
the
town
a
little
house
wherein
there
lived
alone
a
very
poor
girl
so
poor
that
her
clothes
were
patched
and
tattered
and
dirty
and
her
person
on
account
of
long
neglect
and
shameful
to
look
upon
though
she
herself
was
not
ugly
but
had
a
winning
face
and
bright
eyes
that
is
if
the
face
had
been
more
oval
and
the
eyes
less
oppressed
with
care
so
poor
was
she
that
she
herded
turkeys
for
a
living
and
little
was
given
to
her
except
the
food
she
subsisted
on
from
day
to
day
and
perhaps
now
and
then
a
piece
of
old
clothing
like
the
extremely
poor
everywhere
and
at
all
times
she
was
humble
and
by
her
longing
for
kindness
which
she
never
received
she
was
made
kind
even
to
the
creatures
that
depended
upon
her
and
lavished
this
kindness
upon
the
turkeys
she
drove
to
and
from
the
plains
every
day
thus
the
turkeys
appreciating
this
were
very
obedient
they
loved
their
mistress
so
much
that
at
her
call
they
would
unhesitatingly
come
or
at
her
behest
go
whithersoever
and
whensoever
she
wished
one
day
this
poor
girl
driving
her
turkeys
down
into
the
plains
passed
near
old
zuñi
the
middle
ant
hill
of
the
world
as
our
ancients
have
taught
us
to
call
our
home
and
as
she
went
along
she
heard
the
proclaiming
from
the
that
the
dance
of
the
sacred
bird
which
is
a
very
blessed
and
welcome
festival
to
our
people
especially
to
the
youths
and
maidens
who
are
permitted
to
join
in
the
dance
would
take
place
in
four
days
now
this
poor
girl
had
never
been
permitted
to
join
in
or
even
to
watch
the
great
festivities
of
our
people
or
the
people
in
the
neighboring
towns
and
naturally
she
longed
very
much
to
see
this
dance
but
she
put
aside
her
longing
because
she
reflected
it
is
impossible
that
i
should
watch
much
less
join
in
the
dance
of
the
sacred
bird
ugly
and
as
i
and
thus
musing
to
herself
and
talking
to
her
turkeys
as
was
her
custom
she
drove
them
on
and
at
night
returned
them
to
their
cages
round
the
edges
and
in
the
plazas
of
the
town
every
day
after
that
until
the
day
named
for
the
dance
this
poor
girl
as
she
drove
her
turkeys
out
in
the
morning
saw
the
people
busy
in
cleaning
and
preparing
their
garments
cooking
delicacies
and
otherwise
making
ready
for
the
festival
to
which
they
had
been
duly
invited
by
the
other
villagers
and
heard
them
talking
and
laughing
merrily
at
the
prospect
of
the
coming
holiday
so
as
she
went
about
with
her
turkeys
through
the
day
she
would
talk
to
them
though
she
never
dreamed
that
they
understood
a
word
of
what
she
was
saying
it
seems
that
they
did
understand
even
more
than
she
said
to
them
for
on
the
fourth
day
after
the
people
of
mátsaki
had
all
departed
toward
zuñi
and
the
girl
was
wandering
around
the
plains
alone
with
her
turkeys
one
of
the
big
gobblers
strutted
up
to
her
and
making
a
fan
of
his
tail
and
skirts
as
it
were
of
his
wings
blushed
with
pride
and
puffed
with
importance
stretched
out
his
neck
and
said
maiden
mother
we
know
what
your
thoughts
are
and
truly
we
pity
you
and
wish
that
like
the
other
people
of
mátsaki
you
might
enjoy
this
holiday
in
the
town
below
we
have
said
to
ourselves
at
night
after
you
have
placed
us
safely
and
comfortably
in
our
cages
truly
our
maiden
mother
is
as
worthy
to
enjoy
these
things
as
any
one
in
mátsaki
or
even
now
listen
well
for
i
speak
the
speech
of
all
the
elders
of
my
people
if
you
will
drive
us
in
early
this
afternoon
when
the
dance
is
most
gay
and
the
people
are
most
happy
we
will
help
you
to
make
yourself
so
handsome
and
so
prettily
dressed
that
never
a
man
woman
or
child
amongst
all
those
who
are
assembled
at
the
dance
will
know
you
but
rather
especially
the
young
men
will
wonder
whence
you
came
and
long
to
lay
hold
of
your
hand
in
the
circle
that
forms
round
the
altar
to
dance
maiden
mother
would
you
like
to
go
to
see
this
dance
and
even
to
join
in
it
and
be
merry
with
the
best
of
your
people
the
poor
girl
was
at
first
surprised
then
it
seemed
all
so
natural
that
the
turkeys
should
talk
to
her
as
she
did
to
them
that
she
sat
down
on
a
little
mound
and
leaning
over
looked
at
them
and
said
my
beloved
turkeys
how
glad
i
am
that
we
may
speak
together
but
why
should
you
tell
me
of
things
that
you
full
well
know
i
so
long
to
but
can
not
by
any
possible
means
do
trust
in
us
said
the
old
gobbler
for
i
speak
the
speech
of
my
people
and
when
we
begin
to
call
and
call
and
gobble
and
gobble
and
turn
toward
our
home
in
mátsaki
do
you
follow
us
and
we
will
show
you
what
we
can
do
for
you
only
let
me
tell
you
one
thing
no
one
knows
how
much
happiness
and
good
fortune
may
come
to
you
if
you
but
enjoy
temperately
the
pleasures
we
enable
you
to
participate
in
but
if
in
the
excess
of
your
enjoyment
you
should
forget
us
who
are
your
friends
yet
so
much
depend
upon
you
then
we
will
think
behold
this
our
maiden
mother
though
so
humble
and
poor
deserves
forsooth
her
hard
life
because
were
she
more
prosperous
she
would
be
unto
others
as
others
now
are
unto
never
fear
o
my
turkeys
cried
the
maiden
only
half
trusting
that
they
could
do
so
much
for
her
yet
longing
to
try
never
fear
in
everything
you
direct
me
to
do
i
will
be
obedient
as
you
always
have
been
to
the
sun
had
scarce
begun
to
decline
when
the
turkeys
of
their
own
accord
turned
homeward
and
the
maiden
followed
them
light
of
heart
they
knew
their
places
well
and
immediately
ran
to
them
when
all
had
entered
even
their
children
the
old
gobbler
called
to
the
maiden
saying
enter
our
she
therefore
went
in
now
maiden
sit
down
said
he
and
give
to
me
and
my
companions
one
by
one
your
articles
of
clothing
we
will
see
if
we
can
not
renew
the
maiden
obediently
drew
off
the
ragged
old
mantle
that
covered
her
shoulders
and
cast
it
on
the
ground
before
the
speaker
he
seized
it
in
his
beak
and
spread
it
out
and
picked
and
picked
at
it
then
he
trod
upon
it
and
lowering
his
wings
began
to
strut
back
and
forth
over
it
then
taking
it
up
in
his
beak
and
continuing
to
strut
he
puffed
and
puffed
and
laid
it
down
at
the
feet
of
the
maiden
a
beautiful
white
embroidered
cotton
mantle
then
another
gobbler
came
forth
and
she
gave
him
another
article
of
dress
and
then
another
and
another
until
each
garment
the
maiden
had
worn
was
new
and
as
beautiful
as
any
possessed
by
her
mistresses
in
mátsaki
before
the
maiden
donned
all
these
garments
the
turkeys
circled
about
her
singing
and
singing
and
clucking
and
clucking
and
brushing
her
with
their
wings
until
her
person
was
as
clean
and
her
skin
as
smooth
and
bright
as
that
of
the
fairest
maiden
of
the
wealthiest
home
in
mátsaki
her
hair
was
soft
and
wavy
instead
of
being
an
ugly
shock
her
cheeks
were
full
and
dimpled
and
her
eyes
dancing
with
smiles
for
she
now
saw
how
true
had
been
the
words
of
the
turkeys
finally
one
old
turkey
came
forward
and
said
only
the
rich
ornaments
worn
by
those
who
have
many
possessions
are
lacking
to
thee
o
maiden
mother
wait
a
moment
we
have
keen
eyes
and
have
gathered
many
valuable
things
as
such
things
being
small
though
precious
are
apt
to
be
lost
from
time
to
time
by
men
and
spreading
his
wings
he
trod
round
and
round
upon
the
ground
throwing
his
head
back
and
laying
his
wattled
beard
on
his
neck
and
presently
beginning
to
cough
he
produced
in
his
beak
a
beautiful
necklace
another
turkey
brought
forth
earrings
and
so
on
until
all
the
proper
ornaments
appeared
befitting
a
maiden
of
the
olden
days
and
were
laid
at
the
feet
of
the
poor
turkey
girl
with
these
beautiful
things
she
decorated
herself
and
thanking
the
turkeys
over
and
over
she
started
to
go
and
they
called
out
o
maiden
mother
leave
open
the
wicket
for
who
knows
whether
you
will
remember
your
turkeys
or
not
when
your
fortunes
are
changed
and
if
you
will
not
grow
ashamed
that
you
have
been
the
maiden
mother
of
turkeys
but
we
love
you
and
would
bring
you
to
good
fortune
therefore
remember
our
words
of
advice
and
do
not
tarry
too
i
will
surely
remember
o
my
turkeys
answered
the
maiden
hastily
she
sped
away
down
the
river
path
toward
zuñi
when
she
arrived
there
she
went
in
at
the
western
side
of
the
town
and
through
one
of
the
long
covered
ways
that
lead
into
the
dance
court
when
she
came
just
inside
of
the
court
behold
every
one
began
to
look
at
her
and
many
murmurs
ran
through
the
crowd
murmurs
of
astonishment
at
her
beauty
and
the
richness
of
her
dress
and
the
people
were
all
asking
one
another
whence
comes
this
beautiful
maiden
not
long
did
she
stand
there
neglected
the
chiefs
of
the
dance
all
gorgeous
in
their
holiday
attire
hastily
came
to
her
and
with
apologies
for
the
incompleteness
of
their
arrangements
though
these
arrangements
were
as
complete
as
they
possibly
could
be
invited
her
to
join
the
youths
and
maidens
dancing
round
the
musicians
and
the
altar
in
the
center
of
the
plaza
with
a
blush
and
a
smile
and
a
toss
of
her
hair
over
her
eyes
the
maiden
stepped
into
the
circle
and
the
finest
youths
among
the
dancers
vied
with
one
another
for
her
hand
her
heart
became
light
and
her
feet
merry
and
the
music
sped
her
breath
to
rapid
coming
and
going
and
the
warmth
swept
over
her
face
and
she
danced
and
danced
until
the
sun
sank
low
in
the
west
but
alas
in
the
excess
of
her
enjoyment
she
thought
not
of
her
turkeys
or
if
she
thought
of
them
she
said
to
herself
how
is
this
that
i
should
go
away
from
the
most
precious
consideration
to
my
flock
of
gobbling
turkeys
i
will
stay
a
while
longer
and
just
before
the
sun
sets
i
will
run
back
to
them
that
these
people
may
not
see
who
i
am
and
that
i
may
have
the
joy
of
hearing
them
talk
day
after
day
and
wonder
who
the
girl
was
who
joined
in
their
so
the
time
sped
on
and
another
dance
was
called
and
another
and
never
a
moment
did
the
people
let
her
rest
but
they
would
have
her
in
every
dance
as
they
moved
around
the
musicians
and
the
altar
in
the
center
of
the
plaza
at
last
the
sun
set
and
the
dance
was
over
when
suddenly
breaking
away
the
girl
ran
out
and
being
swift
of
foot
more
so
than
most
of
the
people
of
her
village
she
sped
up
the
river
path
before
any
one
could
follow
the
course
she
had
taken
meantime
as
it
grew
late
the
turkeys
began
to
wonder
and
wonder
that
their
maiden
mother
did
not
return
to
them
at
last
a
gray
old
gobbler
mournfully
exclaimed
it
is
as
we
might
have
expected
she
has
forgotten
us
therefore
is
she
not
worthy
of
better
things
than
those
she
has
been
accustomed
to
let
us
go
forth
to
the
mountains
and
endure
no
more
of
this
irksome
captivity
inasmuch
as
we
may
no
longer
think
our
maiden
mother
as
good
and
true
as
once
we
thought
so
calling
and
calling
to
one
another
in
loud
voices
they
trooped
out
of
their
cage
and
ran
up
toward
the
cañon
of
the
cottonwoods
and
then
round
behind
thunder
mountain
through
the
gateway
of
zuñi
and
so
on
up
the
valley
all
breathless
the
maiden
arrived
at
the
open
wicket
and
looked
in
behold
not
a
turkey
was
there
trailing
them
she
ran
and
she
ran
up
the
valley
to
overtake
them
but
they
were
far
ahead
and
it
was
only
after
a
long
time
that
she
came
within
the
sound
of
their
voices
and
then
redoubling
her
speed
overtook
them
when
she
heard
them
singing
this
song

went

we
all
run

hearing
this
the
maiden
called
to
her
turkeys
called
and
called
in
vain
they
only
quickened
their
steps
spreading
their
wings
to
help
them
along
singing
the
song
over
and
over
until
indeed
they
came
to
the
base
of
the
cañon
mesa
at
the
borders
of
the
zuñi
mountains
then
singing
once
more
their
song
in
full
chorus
they
spread
wide
their
wings
and
they
fluttered
away
over
the
plains
above
the
poor
turkey
girl
threw
her
hands
up
and
looked
down
at
her
dress
with
dust
and
sweat
behold
it
was
changed
to
what
it
had
been
and
she
was
the
same
poor
turkey
girl
that
she
was
before
weary
grieving
and
despairing
she
returned
to
mátsaki
thus
it
was
in
the
days
of
the
ancients
therefore
where
you
see
the
rocks
leading
up
to
the
top
of
cañon
mesa
oskwi
there
are
the
tracks
of
turkeys
and
other
figures
to
be
seen
the
latter
are
the
song
that
the
turkeys
sang
graven
in
the
rocks
and
all
over
the
plains
along
the
borders
of
zuñi
mountains
since
that
day
turkeys
have
been
more
abundant
than
in
any
other
place
after
all
the
gods
dispose
of
men
according
as
men
are
fitted
and
if
the
poor
be
poor
in
heart
and
spirit
as
well
as
in
appearance
how
will
they
be
aught
but
poor
to
the
end
of
their
days
thus
shortens
my
story
illustration
pottery
containers
illustration
zuñi
from
the
south
photo
by
vroman
how
the
summer
birds
came
in
the
days
of
the
ancients
in
the
town
under
thunder
mountain
called
k
iákime
there
lived
a
most
beautiful
maiden
but
one
thing
which
struck
the
people
who
knew
her
was
that
she
seldom
came
forth
from
her
room
or
went
out
of
her
house
never
seemed
to
care
for
the
people
around
her
never
seemed
to
care
to
see
the
young
men
when
they
were
dancing
now
this
was
the
way
of
it
through
the
roof
of
her
room
was
a
little
skylight
open
and
when
it
rained
one
of
the
gods
of
the
rain
descended
in
the
and
wooed
this
maiden
and
married
her
all
unknown
to
her
people
so
that
she
was
in
his
company
every
time
it
rained
and
when
the
dew
fell
at
night
on
his
ladder
of
water
descending
he
came
and
she
was
very
happy
and
cared
not
for
the
society
of
men
behold
to
the
utter
surprise
of
the
people
whose
eyes
could
not
see
this
god
her
husband
there
was
a
little
boy
born
to
her
now
he
was
the
child
of
the
gods
and
therefore
before
he
was
many
days
old
he
had
begun
to
run
about
and
speak
and
had
wonderful
intelligence
and
wonderful
strength
and
vivacity
he
was
only
a
month
or
two
old
when
he
was
like
a
child
of
five
or
six
or
eight
years
of
age
and
he
would
climb
to
the
and
run
down
into
the
plaza
and
out
around
the
village
hunting
birds
or
other
small
animals
with
only
his
fingers
and
little
stones
for
weapons
he
never
failed
to
slay
and
bring
home
these
little
creatures
and
his
mother
s
house
was
supplied
more
than
any
other
house
in
the
town
with
plumes
for
sacrifice
from
the
birds
which
he
captured
in
this
way
finally
he
observed
that
the
older
men
of
the
tribe
carried
bows
and
arrows
and
that
the
arrows
went
more
swiftly
and
straighter
than
the
stones
he
threw
and
though
he
never
failed
to
kill
small
animals
he
found
he
could
not
kill
the
larger
ones
in
that
way
so
he
said
to
his
mother
one
night
oh
mother
where
does
the
wood
grow
that
they
make
bows
of
and
where
do
they
get
sticks
for
their
arrows
i
wish
you
would
tell
but
the
mother
was
quite
silent
she
didn
t
like
to
tell
him
for
she
thought
it
would
lead
him
away
from
the
town
and
something
would
happen
to
him
but
he
kept
questioning
her
until
at
last
weary
with
his
importunities
she
said
well
my
little
boy
if
you
go
round
the
cliff
here
to
the
eastern
side
there
is
a
great
hollow
in
the
rocks
and
down
at
the
bottom
of
that
hollow
is
a
great
cave
now
around
that
shelter
in
the
rocks
are
growing
the
trees
out
of
which
bows
are
made
and
there
also
grow
the
bushes
from
which
arrows
are
cut
they
are
so
plentiful
that
they
could
supply
the
whole
town
and
furnish
all
the
hunters
here
with
bows
and
arrows
but
they
can
not
get
them
because
in
the
cave
lives
a
great
bear
a
very
savage
being
and
no
one
dares
go
near
there
to
get
timber
for
the
bows
or
sticks
for
the
arrows
because
the
bear
would
surely
devour
whoever
ventured
there
he
has
devoured
many
of
our
people
therefore
you
must
not
go
there
to
get
these
no
indeed
said
the
boy
but
at
night
he
lay
down
with
much
in
his
mind
and
was
so
thoughtful
that
he
hardly
slept
the
whole
night
he
was
planning
what
he
would
do
in
the
morning
the
next
morning
his
mother
was
busy
about
her
work
and
finally
she
went
down
to
the
spring
for
some
water
and
the
little
boy
slipped
out
of
the
house
ran
down
the
ladder
went
to
the
stooped
down
and
crawled
along
the
bank
of
the
river
until
he
could
get
around
on
the
side
of
the
cliff
where
the
little
valley
of
the
spring
that
flows
under
thunder
mountain
lies
there
he
climbed
up
and
up
until
he
came
to
the
shelter
in
the
rocks
round
on
the
eastern
side
of
thunder
mountain
the
mouth
of
this
hollow
was
entirely
closed
with
fine
and
oak
the
best
timber
we
have
for
bows
and
straight
sprouts
were
growing
everywhere
out
of
which
arrows
could
be
made
ah
this
must
be
the
place
said
the
boy
as
he
looked
at
it
i
don
t
see
any
bear
i
think
i
will
climb
up
and
see
if
there
is
anything
to
be
afraid
of
and
try
if
i
can
cut
a
stick
before
the
bear
comes
he
started
and
climbed
into
the
mouth
of
the
cavern
and
his
father
one
of
the
gods
of
the
rain
threw
a
tremendous
shaft
of
lightning
and
it
thundered
and
the
cave
closed
together
ha
cried
the
boy
what
in
the
world
is
the
meaning
of
this
then
he
stood
there
a
moment
and
presently
the
clouds
finished
and
the
cave
opened
and
all
was
quiet
he
started
to
go
in
once
more
and
down
came
the
lightning
again
to
remind
him
that
he
should
not
go
in
there
ha
cried
the
boy
again
what
in
the
world
does
it
mean
and
he
rubbed
his
eyes
it
had
rather
stunned
him
and
so
soon
as
it
had
cleared
away
he
tried
again
and
again
for
the
fourth
time
finally
the
god
said
ah
i
have
reminded
him
and
he
does
not
heed
he
must
go
his
own
so
the
boy
climbed
into
the
cave
no
sooner
had
he
got
in
than
it
began
to
get
dark
and
came
the
bear
on
his
hind
legs
and
grabbed
the
boy
and
began
to
squeeze
him
very
tight
o
my
o
my
cried
he
don
t
squeeze
me
so
hard
it
hurts
don
t
squeeze
me
so
hard
my
mother
is
one
of
the
most
beautiful
women
you
ever
saw
hollo
exclaimed
the
bear
what
is
that
you
say
my
mother
is
one
of
the
most
beautiful
women
you
ever
saw
indeed
said
the
bear
as
he
relaxed
his
hold
my
son
sit
down
what
did
you
come
to
my
house
for
i
am
sure
you
are
very
why
said
the
boy
i
came
to
get
a
piece
of
wood
for
a
bow
and
sticks
for
said
the
bear
i
have
looked
out
for
this
timber
for
a
long
time
there
is
none
better
in
the
whole
country
let
me
tell
you
what
i
will
do
you
don
t
look
very
strong
you
haven
t
anything
to
cut
the
trees
down
with
i
will
go
myself
and
cut
down
a
tree
for
you
i
will
pick
out
a
good
one
for
a
bow
not
only
that
but
i
will
get
fine
sticks
for
arrows
so
he
stalked
off
into
the
forest
and
crack
crack
he
smashed
the
trees
down
and
picking
out
a
good
one
gnawed
off
the
ends
of
it
and
brought
it
to
the
boy
then
gathered
a
lot
of
fine
straight
sticks
for
and
brought
them
there
said
he
take
those
home
do
you
know
how
to
make
a
bow
my
son
no
i
don
t
very
well
replied
he
well
said
the
bear
i
have
cut
off
the
ends
make
it
about
that
length
now
take
it
home
and
shave
down
the
inside
until
it
is
thin
enough
to
bend
quickly
at
both
ends
and
lay
it
over
the
coals
of
fire
so
it
will
get
hard
and
dry
that
is
the
way
to
make
a
good
all
right
said
the
boy
and
as
he
took
up
the
bundle
of
sticks
and
the
stave
for
the
bow
he
said
just
come
along
toward
night
and
i
will
introduce
you
to
my
all
right
said
the
old
bear
i
will
be
along
just
about
sunset
then
i
can
look
at
your
bow
and
see
whether
you
have
made
it
well
or
so
the
boy
trudged
home
with
his
bundle
of
sticks
and
his
bow
stave
and
when
he
arrived
there
his
mother
happened
to
be
climbing
out
and
saw
him
coming
you
wretched
boy
she
said
i
told
you
not
to
go
out
to
the
cave
i
warrant
you
have
been
there
where
the
bear
stays
oh
yes
my
mother
just
see
what
i
have
brought
said
the
boy
i
sold
you
to
the
bear
he
will
be
here
to
get
you
this
evening
see
what
i
have
brought
and
he
laid
out
his
and
oh
said
she
you
are
the
most
wretched
and
foolish
of
little
boys
you
pay
no
attention
to
what
any
one
says
to
you
your
mother
s
word
is
nothing
but
wind
in
your
just
see
what
i
have
brought
home
said
he
he
worked
as
hard
as
he
could
to
make
his
bow
stripped
the
smoothed
and
straightened
them
before
the
fire
and
made
the
points
of
obsidian
very
black
it
is
very
hard
and
sharp
were
the
points
when
he
placed
them
on
the
arrows
now
after
placing
the
feathers
on
the
arrows
he
stood
them
up
on
the
roof
of
the
house
against
the
parapet
in
the
sunlight
to
dry
and
he
had
his
bow
on
the
other
side
of
the
house
against
the
other
parapet
to
dry
he
was
still
at
work
toward
sunset
when
he
happened
to
look
up
and
saw
the
bear
coming
along
slowly
comfortably
rolling
over
the
sand
ah
said
he
the
old
man
is
he
paid
no
attention
to
him
however
presently
the
bear
came
close
to
the
ladder
and
shook
it
to
see
if
it
was
strong
enough
to
hold
him
thou
comest
asked
the
boy
yes
said
the
bear
how
have
you
been
all
day
happy
said
the
boy
how
is
your
mother
happy
said
the
boy
expecting
so
the
old
bear
climbed
up
ah
indeed
said
he
as
he
got
over
the
edge
of
the
house
have
you
made
the
bow
yes
after
a
so
the
bear
went
over
raised
himself
on
his
hind
feet
looked
at
the
bow
pulled
it
and
said
as
he
laid
it
down
it
is
a
splendid
bow
what
is
this
black
stuff
on
these
arrows
obsidian
answered
the
boy
these
points
are
nothing
but
black
coals
said
the
bear
i
tell
you
said
the
boy
they
are
good
black
flint
hard
and
sharp
as
any
no
said
the
other
nothing
but
now
suppose
you
let
me
try
one
of
those
coals
on
you
said
the
boy
all
right
said
the
bear
he
walked
over
to
the
other
side
of
the
roof
and
stood
there
and
the
boy
took
one
of
the
arrows
fitted
it
to
the
bow
and
let
go
it
went
straight
into
the
heart
of
the
bear
and
even
passed
through
him
entirely
wah
uttered
the
bear
as
he
gave
a
great
snort
and
rolled
over
on
the
and
died
ha
ha
shouted
the
boy
what
you
had
intended
to
do
unto
me
thus
unto
you
oh
mother

he
as
he
ran
to
the
here

have
killed
him
but
then
he
would
have
me
make
the
experiment
said
the
boy
oh
you
foolish
foolish
disobedient
boy
said
the
mother
what
have
you
been
doing
now
are
we
safe
oh
yes
said
he
my
is
as
passive
as
if
he
were
and
he
went
on
and
skinned
his
once
prospective
and
then
took
out
his
heart
and
hung
it
to
the
of
the
ladder
as
a
sign
that
the
people
could
go
and
get
all
the
and
arrows
they
pleased
that
night
after
the
evening
meal
was
over
the
boy
sat
down
with
his
mother
and
he
said
by
the
way
mother
are
there
any
monsters
or
fearful
creatures
anywhere
round
about
this
country
that
kill
people
and
make
trouble
no
said
the
mother
none
i
don
t
know
about
that
i
think
there
must
be
said
the
boy
no
there
are
none
whatever
i
tell
you
answered
the
mother
the
boy
began
to
tumble
on
the
floor
rolling
about
playing
with
his
mother
s
blankets
and
throwing
things
around
and
once
in
a
while
he
would
ask
her
again
the
same
question
until
finally
she
got
very
cross
with
him
and
said
yes
if
you
want
to
know
down
there
in
the
valley
beyond
the
great
plains
of
sagebrush
is
a
den
of
lizards
who
are
fearful
and
deadly
to
every
one
who
goes
near
them
therefore
you
had
better
be
careful
how
you
run
round
the
what
makes
them
so
fearful
asked
he
well
said
she
they
are
venomous
they
have
a
way
of
throwing
from
their
mouths
or
breath
a
sort
of
fluid
which
whenever
it
strikes
a
person
burns
him
and
whenever
it
strikes
the
eyes
it
blinds
them
a
great
many
people
have
perished
there
whenever
a
man
arrives
at
their
den
they
are
very
polite
and
greet
him
most
courteously
they
say
come
in
sit
down
right
here
in
the
middle
of
the
floor
before
the
but
as
soon
as
the
person
is
seated
in
their
house
they
gather
round
the
walls
and
throw
this
venom
on
him
and
he
dies
almost
is
it
possible
responded
the
little
boy
and
for
some
reason
or
other
he
began
to
grow
sleepy
and
said
now
let
us
go
to
sleep
so
he
lay
down
and
slept
just
as
soon
as
it
was
light
the
next
morning
he
aroused
himself
dressed
took
his
bow
and
arrows
and
placing
them
in
a
corner
near
the
ladder
said
oh
mother
give
me
my
breakfast
i
want
to
go
and
shoot
some
little
birds
i
would
like
to
have
some
roasted
birds
for
she
gave
him
his
breakfast
as
quickly
as
she
could
and
he
ran
down
the
ladder
and
went
to
shooting
at
the
birds
until
he
happened
to
see
that
his
mother
and
others
were
out
of
sight
then
he
skulked
into
the
sagebrush
and
went
as
straight
as
he
could
for
the
den
of
the
lizards
there
happened
to
be
two
young
ones
sunning
themselves
outside
and
they
said
ah
my
fine
little
fellow
glad
to
see
you
this
morning
come
in
come
in
the
old
ones
will
be
very
much
pleased
to
entertain
you
come
in
thank
you
said
the
boy
he
walked
in
but
he
felt
under
his
coat
to
see
if
a
huge
lump
of
rock
salt
he
had
was
still
there
sit
right
down
here
said
the
old
people
the
whole
den
was
filled
with
these
lizards
and
they
were
excessively
polite
every
one
of
them
the
boy
sat
down
and
the
old
said
to
the
young
ones
hurry
up
now
be
quick
and
they
began
to
throw
their
venom
at
him
and
continued
until
he
was
all
covered
with
it
but
knowing
beforehand
and
being
the
child
of
the
gods
he
was
prepared
and
protected
and
it
did
him
no
harm
thank
you
thank
you
said
the
boy
i
will
do
the
same
then
he
pulled
out
the
salt
and
pushed
it
down
into
the
fire
where
it
exploded
and
entirely
used
up
the
whole
council
of
lizards
there
cried
the
boy
thus
would
you
have
done
unto
me
thus
unto
he
took
two
fine
ones
and
cut
out
their
hearts
then
started
for
home
when
he
arrived
there
he
climbed
the
ladder
and
suspended
the
two
hearts
beside
that
of
the
bear
and
went
down
into
the
house
saying
well
mother
is
dinner
ready
there
now
said
she
i
know
it
i
saw
you
hang
those
hearts
up
you
have
been
down
yes
said
he
they
are
all
gone
every
solitary
one
of
oh
you
foolish
foolish
disobedient
fellow
i
am
all
alone
in
the
world
and
if
you
should
go
to
some
of
those
fearful
places
some
time
and
not
come
back
who
would
hunt
for
me
what
should
i
do
said
the
mother
don
t
be
troubled
mother
now
said
the
boy
i
don
t
think
i
will
go
any
more
there
is
nothing
else
of
that
kind
around
is
there
mother
no
there
is
not
she
replied
not
a
thing
there
may
be
somewhere
in
the
world
but
there
is
not
anywhere
in
the
evening
as
he
sat
with
his
mother
the
boy
kept
questioning
and
teasing
her
to
tell
him
of
some
other
monsters
pulling
on
her
skirts
and
repeating
his
questions
i
tell
you
she
said
there
are
no
such
oh
mother
i
know
there
are
said
he
and
you
must
tell
me
about
so
he
continued
to
bother
her
until
her
patience
gave
out
and
she
told
him
of
another
monster
said
she
if
you
follow
that
cañon
down
to
the
southeast
there
is
a
very
very
very
high
cliff
there
and
the
trail
that
goes
over
that
cliff
runs
close
by
the
side
of
a
precipice
now
that
has
been
for
ages
a
terrible
place
for
there
is
a
giant
living
there
who
wears
a
on
his
forehead
he
lies
there
at
length
sunning
himself
at
his
ease
he
is
very
and
very
polite
his
legs
stretch
across
the
trail
on
which
men
have
to
go
who
pass
that
way
and
there
is
no
other
way
to
get
by
and
whenever
a
man
tries
to
go
by
that
trail
he
says
pass
right
along
pass
right
along
i
am
glad
to
see
you
here
is
a
fresh
trail
some
one
has
just
passed
don
t
disturb
me
i
am
sunning
down
below
is
the
den
where
his
children
live
and
on
the
flesh
of
these
people
he
feeds
mercy
exclaimed
the
boy
fearful
i
never
shall
go
there
surely
that
is
too
terrible
come
let
us
go
to
sleep
i
don
t
want
to
hear
anything
more
about
but
the
next
morning
just
as
soon
as
daylight
appeared
he
got
up
dressed
himself
and
snatched
a
morsel
of
food
his
mother
said
to
him
where
are
you
going
are
you
thinking
of
that
place
i
told
you
about
no
said
he
i
am
going
to
kill
some
right
here
in
sight
i
will
take
my
so
he
took
his
and
thrust
it
into
his
belt
in
front
ran
down
the
hill
on
which
the
village
stood
and
straightway
went
off
to
the
place
his
mother
had
told
him
of
when
he
reached
the
top
of
the
rocks
he
looked
down
and
there
sure
enough
lay
the
giant
with
the
forehead
knot
the
giant
looked
up
and
said
ah
my
son
glad
to
see
you
this
morning
glad
to
see
you
coming
so
early
some
one
just
passed
here
a
little
while
ago
you
can
see
his
tracks
well
said
the
boy
make
room
for
oh
just
step
right
over
said
the
old
man
step
right
over
i
can
t
step
over
your
great
legs
said
the
boy
draw
them
all
right
said
the
old
demon
so
he
drew
his
knees
up
there
now
there
is
plenty
of
room
pass
right
along
my
just
as
the
boy
got
near
the
place
he
thrust
out
his
leg
suddenly
that
way
to
kick
him
off
the
cliff
but
the
boy
was
too
nimble
for
him
and
jumped
aside
oh
dear
me
cried
the
monster
i
had
a
stitch
in
my
leg
i
had
to
stretch
it
ah
said
the
boy
you
tried
to
kick
me
off
did
you
oh
no
said
the
old
villain
i
had
a
terrible
stitch
in
my
knee
and
he
began
to
knead
his
knee
in
the
most
vehement
manner
just
pass
right
along
i
trust
it
won
t
happen
the
boy
again
attempted
to
pass
and
the
same
thing
happened
as
before
oh
my
knee
my
knee
exclaimed
the
monster
yes
your
knee
your
knee
said
the
boy
as
he
whipped
out
his
and
whacked
the
giant
on
the
head
before
he
had
time
to
recover
himself
thus
unto
me
you
would
have
done
thus
unto
you
said
the
boy
no
sooner
had
the
giant
fallen
than
the
little
gathered
round
him
and
began
to
eat
and
they
ate
and
ate
and
ate
there
were
many
of
them
and
they
were
voracious
until
they
came
to
the
on
the
old
fellow
s
head
and
then
one
of
them
cried
oh
dear
alas
and
alas
this
is
our
own
father
and
while
they
were
still
crying
the
boy
cut
out
the
giant
s
heart
and
slung
it
over
his
shoulder
then
he
climbed
down
the
cliff
to
where
the
young
were
and
slew
them
all
except
two
a
pair
of
them
then
he
took
these
two
who
were
still
young
like
little
children
and
grasping
one
by
the
throat
wrung
its
neck
and
threw
it
into
the
air
when
it
suddenly
became
a
winged
creature
and
spread
out
its
wings
and
soared
away
crying
peep
peep
peep
just
as
the
falcons
of
today
do
then
he
took
the
other
one
by
the
neck
and
swung
it
round
and
round
and
flung
it
into
the
air
and
it
flew
away
with
a
heavy
motion
and
cried
boohoo
boohoo
boohoo
and
became
an
owl
ah
said
the
boy
born
for
evil
changed
for
good
ye
shall
be
the
means
whereby
our
children
in
the
future
shall
sacrifice
to
the
gods
then
he
trudged
along
home
with
the
giant
s
heart
and
when
he
got
there
he
hung
it
on
the
of
the
ladder
by
the
side
of
the
other
hearts
it
was
almost
night
then
there
now
said
his
mother
as
he
entered
the
house
i
have
been
troubled
almost
to
death
by
your
not
coming
home
sooner
you
went
off
to
the
place
i
told
you
of
i
know
you
did
ha
said
he
of
course
i
did
i
went
up
there
and
the
poor
fellows
are
all
why
will
you
not
listen
to
me
said
she
oh
it
is
all
right
mother
said
the
boy
it
is
all
she
went
on
scolding
him
in
the
usual
fashion
but
he
paid
no
attention
to
her
as
soon
as
she
had
sat
down
to
her
evening
tasks
he
asked
now
is
there
any
other
of
these
terrible
creatures
well
i
shall
tell
you
of
nothing
more
now
said
she
why
is
there
anything
more
asked
the
boy
no
there
is
not
replied
she
ah
mother
i
think
there
must
no
there
is
nothing
more
i
tell
ah
mother
i
think
there
must
and
he
kept
bothering
and
teasing
until
she
told
him
again
she
knew
she
would
have
to
yes
away
down
in
the
valley
some
distance
from
here
near
the
little
hill
there
lives
a
fearful
creature
a
elk
or
bison
more
enormous
than
any
other
living
thing
he
is
called
and
no
one
can
go
near
him
he
rushes
stamping
and
bellowing
about
the
country
and
people
never
pass
through
that
section
from
ah
said
the
boy
don
t
tell
me
any
more
he
must
be
a
fearful
creature
yes
but
you
will
be
sure
to
go
there
said
she
oh
no
no
mother
no
indeed
but
the
next
morning
he
went
earlier
than
ever
carrying
with
him
his
bows
and
arrows
he
was
so
filled
with
dread
however
or
pretended
to
be
that
as
he
went
along
the
trail
he
began
to
cry
and
sniffle
and
walk
very
slowly
until
he
came
near
the
hole
of
an
old
gopher
his
grandfather
the
old
fellow
was
working
away
digging
another
cellar
throwing
the
dirt
out
when
he
heard
this
crying
said
he
that
is
my
grandson
i
wonder
what
he
is
up
to
so
he
ran
and
stuck
his
nose
out
of
the
hole
he
was
digging
and
said
oh
my
grandchild
where
are
you
going
the
boy
stopped
and
began
to
look
around
right
here
right
here
cried
the
grandfather
calling
his
attention
to
the
hole
come
my
the
boy
put
his
foot
in
and
the
hole
enlarged
and
he
went
down
into
it
now
dry
your
eyes
my
grandchild
and
tell
me
what
is
the
well
said
the
boy
i
was
going
to
find
the
bison
i
wanted
to
take
a
look
at
him
but
i
am
frightened
why
what
is
the
matter
why
do
you
not
go
said
the
gopher
well
to
tell
you
the
truth
i
thought
i
would
try
to
kill
him
he
answered
well
i
will
do
what
i
can
to
help
you
had
better
not
try
to
do
it
alone
sit
here
comfortably
dry
your
eyes
and
i
will
see
what
i
can
the
old
gopher
began
to
dig
dig
dig
under
the
ground
for
a
long
way
making
a
fine
tunnel
and
packed
it
hard
on
the
top
and
sides
so
that
it
would
not
fall
in
he
finally
came
to
hear
the
thud
thud
thud
of
the
heart
of
this
creature
where
it
was
lying
and
dug
the
hole
up
to
that
spot
when
he
got
there
he
saw
the
long
layers
of
hair
on
its
body
where
no
arrow
could
penetrate
and
he
cut
the
hair
off
so
that
the
skin
showed
white
then
he
silently
stole
back
to
where
the
boy
was
and
said
now
my
boy
take
your
bow
and
arrows
and
go
along
through
this
hole
until
you
get
to
where
the
tunnel
turns
upward
and
then
if
you
look
well
you
will
see
a
light
patch
that
is
the
skin
next
the
heart
of
the
bison
he
is
sleeping
there
you
will
hear
the
thud
thud
thud
of
his
heart
shoot
him
exactly
in
the
middle
of
that
place
and
then
mind
you
turn
around
and
run
for
your
life
and
the
moment
you
get
to
my
hole
tumble
in
headforemost
or
any
so
the
boy
did
as
he
was
told
crawled
through
the
tunnel
until
he
came
to
where
it
went
upward
saw
the
light
patch
and
let
fly
an
arrow
with
all
his
might
then
rushed
and
scrambled
back
as
hard
as
he
could
with
a
roar
that
shook
the
earth
the
bison
fell
over
then
struggled
to
his
feet
snorted
bellowed
and
stuck
his
great
horn
into
the
tunnel
and
like
a
flash
of
fire
ripped
it
from
end
to
end
just
as
the
boy
came
tumbling
into
the
deeper
hole
of
his
grandfather
ah
exclaimed
the
gopher
he
almost
got
me
said
the
boy
sit
still
a
moment
and
rest
my
grandson
said
the
gopher
he
didn
t
catch
you
i
will
go
and
see
whether
he
is
so
the
gopher
stuck
his
nose
out
of
the
hole
and
saw
there
a
great
heap
of
flesh
lying
he
went
out
nosed
around
and
smelt
jumped
back
and
went
forward
again
until
he
came
to
the
end
of
the
creature
and
then
he
took
one
of
his
nails
and
scratched
out
an
eye
and
there
was
no
sign
of
life
so
he
ran
back
to
the
boy
and
said
yes
he
breathes
no
more
you
need
not
fear
him
oh
thank
you
my
grandfather
said
the
boy
and
he
climbed
out
and
laid
himself
to
work
to
skin
the
beast
he
took
off
its
great
thick
skin
and
cut
off
a
suitable
piece
of
it
for
the
whole
pelt
was
so
large
and
heavy
that
he
could
not
carry
it
then
he
took
out
the
animal
s
great
heart
and
finally
one
of
the
large
intestines
and
filled
it
with
blood
then
started
for
home
he
went
slowly
because
his
load
was
so
heavy
and
when
he
arrived
he
hung
the
heart
on
the
ladder
by
the
side
of
the
others
and
dragged
the
pelt
to
the
and
nearly
scared
the
wits
out
of
his
mother
by
dropping
it
into
the
room
oh
my
child
now
here
you
are
where
have
you
been
cried
she
i
warned
you
of
the
place
where
the
bison
was
i
wonder
that
you
ever
came
ah
the
poor
creature
said
the
boy
he
is
dead
just
look
at
this
he
isn
t
handsome
any
more
he
isn
t
strong
and
large
any
oh
you
wretched
wretched
boy
you
will
be
the
death
of
me
as
well
as
of
yourself
some
time
said
the
mother
no
mother
said
the
boy
that
is
all
that
evening
the
boy
said
to
his
mother
now
mother
is
there
anything
else
of
this
kind
left
if
there
is
i
want
to
know
it
now
don
t
disappoint
me
by
refusing
to
oh
my
dear
son
said
she
i
wish
you
wouldn
t
ask
me
but
indeed
there
is
there
are
terrible
birds
great
eagles
fearful
eagles
living
over
on
shuntekia
in
the
very
middle
of
an
enormous
cliff
is
a
hollow
place
in
the
rocks
where
is
built
their
nest
and
there
are
their
young
ones
day
after
day
far
and
near
they
catch
up
children
and
young
men
and
women
and
carry
them
away
never
more
to
be
seen
these
birds
are
more
terrible
than
all
the
rest
because
how
can
one
get
near
to
slay
them
my
son
i
do
hope
and
trust
that
you
will
not
go
this
time
but
you
foolish
little
boy
i
see
that
you
will
well
mother
let
us
go
to
sleep
and
never
mind
anything
about
it
said
the
boy
but
after
his
mother
had
gone
to
sleep
he
took
the
piece
of
rawhide
he
had
skinned
from
the
bison
and
cutting
it
out
made
himself
a
suit
a
green
rawhide
suit
almost
so
that
it
was
perfectly
smooth
then
he
scraped
the
hair
off
greased
it
all
over
and
put
it
away
inside
a
blanket
so
that
it
would
not
dry
in
the
morning
quite
early
he
took
his
weapons
and
taking
also
his
rawhide
suit
and
the
section
of
the
bison
s
intestine
which
he
had
filled
with
blood
he
ran
into
the
inlet
and
across
it
and
climbed
the
mesa
near
the
shuntekia
cliff
when
he
came
within
a
short
distance
of
the
nest
of
the
eagles
he
stopped
and
slipped
on
his
rawhide
suit
and
tied
the
intestine
of
blood
round
his
neck
like
a
sausage
then
he
began
to
cry
and
shake
his
head
and
he
cried
louder
than
there
was
any
need
of
his
doing
in
reality
for
presently
the
old
father
of
the
eagles
who
was
away
up
in
the
sky
just
a
mere
speck
heard
and
saw
him
and
came
swishing
down
in
a
great
circle
winding
round
and
round
the
boy
and
the
boy
looked
up
and
began
to
cry
louder
still
as
if
frightened
out
of
his
wits
and
finally
rolled
himself
up
like
a
porcupine
and
threw
himself
down
into
the
trail
crying
and
howling
with
apparent
fear
the
eagle
swooped
down
on
him
and
tried
to
grasp
him
in
his
talons
and
his
claws
simply
slipped
off
the
rawhide
coat
then
the
eagle
made
a
fiercer
grab
at
him
and
grew
angry
but
his
claws
would
continually
slip
off
until
he
tore
a
rent
in
the
intestine
about
the
boy
s
neck
and
the
blood
began
to
stream
over
the
boy
s
coat
making
it
more
slippery
than
ever
when
the
eagle
smelt
the
blood
he
thought
he
had
got
him
and
it
made
him
fiercer
than
ever
and
finally
during
his
struggling
he
got
one
talon
through
a
stitch
in
the
coat
and
he
spread
out
his
wings
and
flew
up
and
circled
round
and
round
over
the
point
where
the
young
eagles
nest
was
when
he
let
go
and
shook
the
boy
free
and
the
boy
rolled
over
and
over
and
came
down
into
the
nest
but
he
struck
on
a
great
heap
of
brush
which
broke
his
fall
he
lay
there
quite
still
and
the
old
eagle
swooped
down
and
poised
himself
on
a
great
crag
of
rock
near
by
which
was
his
usual
perching
place
there
my
children
my
little
ones
said
he
i
have
brought
you
food
feast
yourselves
feast
yourselves
for
that
reason
i
brought
so
the
little
eagles
who
were
very
awkward
and
limped
up
to
the
boy
and
reached
out
their
claws
and
opened
their
beaks
ready
to
strike
him
in
the
face
he
lay
there
quite
still
until
they
got
very
near
and
then
said
to
them
and
they
tumbled
back
being
awkward
little
fellows
and
stretched
up
their
necks
and
looked
at
him
as
eagles
will
then
the
old
eagle
said
why
don
t
you
eat
him
feast
yourselves
my
children
feast
yourselves
so
they
advanced
again
more
cautiously
this
time
and
a
little
more
determinedly
too
and
they
reached
out
their
beaks
to
tear
him
and
he
said
and
under
his
breath
don
t
eat
me
and
they
jumped
back
again
what
in
the
world
is
the
matter
with
you
little
fools
said
the
old
eagle
eat
him
i
can
t
stay
here
any
longer
i
have
to
go
away
and
hunt
to
feed
you
but
you
don
t
seem
to
appreciate
my
efforts
and
he
lifted
his
wings
rose
into
the
air
and
sailed
off
to
the
northward
then
the
two
young
eagles
began
to
walk
around
the
boy
and
to
examine
him
at
all
points
finally
they
approached
his
feet
and
hands
be
careful
be
careful
don
t
eat
me
tell
me
about
what
time
your
mother
comes
home
said
he
sitting
up
what
time
does
she
usually
come
well
said
the
little
eagles
she
comes
home
when
the
clouds
begin
to
gather
and
throw
their
shadow
over
our
really
it
was
the
shadow
of
the
mother
eagle
herself
that
was
thrown
over
the
nest
very
well
said
the
boy
what
time
does
your
father
come
home
when
the
fine
rain
begins
to
fall
said
they
meaning
the
dew
oh
said
the
boy
so
he
sat
there
and
sure
enough
away
off
in
the
sky
carrying
something
dangling
from
her
feet
came
the
old
mother
eagle
she
soared
round
and
round
until
she
was
over
the
nest
when
she
dropped
her
burden
and
over
and
over
it
fell
and
tumbled
into
the
nest
a
poor
dead
beautiful
maiden
the
young
boy
looked
at
her
and
his
heart
grew
very
hot
and
when
the
old
eagle
came
and
perched
in
a
moment
he
let
fly
an
arrow
and
struck
her
down
and
dashed
her
brains
out
ha
ha
exclaimed
the
boy
what
you
have
done
to
many
thus
unto
then
he
took
his
station
again
and
the
old
father
eagle
came
bearing
a
youth
fair
to
look
upon
and
dropped
him
into
the
nest
the
young
boy
shut
his
teeth
and
he
said
thus
unto
many
you
have
done
and
thus
unto
me
you
would
have
done
so
unto
and
he
drew
an
arrow
and
shot
him
then
he
turned
to
the
two
young
eagles
and
killed
them
and
plucked
out
all
the
beautiful
colored
feathers
about
their
necks
until
he
had
a
large
bundle
of
fine
plumes
with
which
he
thought
to
wing
his
arrows
or
to
waft
his
prayers
then
he
looked
down
the
cliff
and
saw
there
was
no
way
to
climb
down
and
there
was
no
way
to
climb
up
then
he
began
to
cry
and
sat
on
the
edge
of
the
cliff
and
cried
so
loud
that
the
old
bat
woman
who
was
gathering
below
or
thought
she
was
overheard
the
boy
said
she
now
just
listen
to
that
i
warrant
it
is
my
fool
of
a
grandson
who
is
always
trying
to
get
himself
into
a
scrape
i
am
sure
it
must
be
so
phoo
phoo
she
spilled
out
all
the
berries
she
had
found
from
the
basket
she
had
on
her
back
and
then
labored
up
to
where
she
could
look
over
the
edge
of
the
shelf
yes
there
you
are
said
she
you
simpleton
you
wretched
boy
what
are
you
doing
here
oh
my
grandmother
said
he
i
have
got
into
a
place
and
i
can
not
get
yes
said
she
if
you
were
anything
else
but
such
a
fool
of
a
grandson
and
such
a
wretch
of
a
boy
i
would
help
you
get
down
but
you
never
do
as
your
mother
and
grandmother
or
grandfathers
tell
ah
my
grandmother
i
will
do
just
as
you
tell
me
this
time
said
the
boy
now
will
you
said
she
now
can
you
be
certain
will
you
promise
me
that
you
will
keep
your
eyes
shut
and
join
me
at
least
in
your
heart
in
the
prayer
which
i
sing
when
i
fly
down
lehalliah
never
open
your
eyes
if
you
do
the
gods
will
teach
you
a
lesson
and
your
poor
old
grandmother
i
will
do
just
as
you
tell
me
said
he
as
he
reached
over
and
took
up
his
plumes
and
held
them
ready
not
so
fast
my
child
said
she
you
must
promise
oh
my
grandmother
i
will
do
just
as
you
tell
me
said
he
well
step
into
my
basket
very
carefully
now
as
i
go
down
i
shall
go
very
prayerfully
depending
on
the
gods
to
carry
so
much
more
than
i
usually
carry
do
you
not
wink
once
my
all
right
i
will
keep
my
eyes
shut
this
time
said
he
so
he
sat
down
and
squeezed
his
eyes
together
and
held
his
plumes
tight
and
then
the
old
grandmother
launched
herself
forth
on
her
skin
wings
after
she
had
struggled
a
little
she
began
to
sing
ha
ash
tchaa
ni
ha
ash
tchaa
ni
tche
pa
naa
thlen
thlen
thlen
now
just
listen
to
that
said
the
boy
my
old
grandmother
is
singing
one
of
those
tedious
prayers
it
will
take
us
forever
to
go
then
presently
the
old
bat
woman
perfectly
unconscious
of
his
state
of
mind
began
to
sing
again
thlen
thla
kia
yai
na
there
she
goes
again
said
he
to
himself
i
declare
i
must
look
up
it
will
drive
me
wild
to
sit
here
all
this
time
and
hear
my
old
grandmother
try
to
then
after
a
little
while
she
commenced
again
ha
ash
tchaa
ni
ha
ash
tchaa
ni
tche
pa
naa
thlen
thlen
thlen
the
boy
stretched
himself
up
and
said
look
here
grandmother
i
have
heard
your
thlen
thlen
enough
this
time
i
am
going
to
open
my
oh
my
grandchild
never

of
such
a
then
she
began
again
to
sing
ha
ash
tchaa
ni
ha
ash
tchaa
ni
tche
pa
naa
thlen
thlen
thlen
she
was
not
near
the
ground
when
she
finished
it
the
fourth
time
and
the
boy
would
not
stand
it
any
more
lo
he
opened
his
eyes
and
the
old
grandmother
knew
it
in
a
moment
over
and
over
boy
over
bat
bat
over
boy
and
the
basket
between
them
they
went
whirling
and
pitching
down
the
old
grandmother
tugging
at
her
basket
and
scolding
the
boy
now
you
foolish
disobedient
one
i
told
you
what
would
happen
you
see
what
you
have
done
and
so
on
until
they
fell
to
the
ground
it
fairly
knocked
the
breath
out
of
the
boy
and
when
he
got
up
again
he
yelled
lustily
the
old
grandmother
picked
herself
up
stretched
herself
and
cried
out
anew
you
wretched
foolish
boy
i
never
will
do
anything
for
you
again
never
never
never
i
know
my
grandmother
said
the
boy
but
you
kept
up
that
thlen
thlen
so
much
what
in
the
world
did
you
want
to
spend
so
much
time
and
buzzing
round
in
that
way
for
ah
me
said
she
he
never
did
know
anything
never
will
be
taught
to
know
now
said
she
to
him
you
might
as
well
come
and
eat
with
me
i
have
been
gathering
and
you
can
eat
and
then
go
she
took
him
to
the
place
where
she
had
poured
out
the
contents
of
the
basket
but
there
was
scarcely
a
there
were
cones
sticks
little
balls
of
dirt
and
everything
else
uneatable
sit
down
my
grandson
and
eat
strengthen
yourself
after
your
various
adventures
and
exertions
i
feel
very
weary
myself
said
she
and
she
took
a
nip
of
one
of
them
but
the
boy
couldn
t
exactly
bring
himself
to
eat
the
truth
is
the
old
woman
s
eyes
were
bad
in
the
same
way
that
bats
eyes
are
usually
bad
and
she
couldn
t
tell
a
from
anything
else
round
and
rough
well
inasmuch
as
you
won
t
eat
my
grandson
said
she
why
i
can
t
conceive
for
these
are
very
good
it
seems
to
me
you
had
better
run
along
home
now
or
your
mother
will
be
killing
herself
thinking
of
you
now
i
have
only
one
direction
to
give
you
you
don
t
deserve
any
but
i
will
give
you
one
see
that
you
pay
attention
to
it
if
not
the
worst
is
your
own
you
have
gathered
a
beautiful
store
of
feathers
now
be
very
careful
those
creatures
who
bore
those
feathers
have
gained
their
lives
from
the
lives
of
living
beings
and
therefore
their
feathers
differ
from
other
feathers
heed
what
i
say
my
grandson
when
you
come
to
any
place
where
flowers
are
blooming
where
the
sunflowers
make
the
field
yellow
walk
round
those
flowers
if
you
want
to
get
home
with
these
feathers
and
when
you
come
to
more
flowers
walk
round
them
if
you
do
not
do
that
just
as
you
came
you
will
go
back
to
your
all
right
my
grandmother
said
the
boy
so
after
bidding
her
he
trudged
away
with
his
bundle
of
feathers
and
when
he
came
to
a
great
plain
of
sunflowers
and
other
flowers
he
walked
round
them
and
when
he
came
to
another
large
patch
he
walked
round
them
and
then
another
and
so
on
but
finally
he
stopped
for
it
seemed
to
him
that
there
were
nothing
but
fields
of
flowers
all
the
way
home
he
thought
he
had
never
seen
so
many
before
i
declare
said
he
i
will
not
walk
round
those
flowers
any
more
i
will
hang
on
to
these
feathers
so
he
took
a
good
hold
of
them
and
walked
in
amongst
the
flowers
but
no
sooner
had
he
entered
the
field
than
flutter
flutter
flutter
little
wings
began
to
fly
out
from
the
bundle
of
feathers
and
the
bundle
began
to
grow
smaller
and
smaller
until
it
wholly
disappeared
these
wings
which
flew
out
were
the
wings
of
the
sacred
birds
of
summerland
made
living
by
the
lives
that
had
supported
the
birds
which
bore
those
feathers
and
by
coming
into
the
environment
which
they
had
so
loved
the
atmosphere
which
flowers
always
bring
of
summer
thus
it
was
my
children
in
the
days
of
the
ancients
and
for
that
reason
we
have
little
little
sparrows
little
finches
little
and
all
the
beautiful
little
birds
that
bring
the
summer
and
they
always
hover
over
flowers
my
friends
said
the
that
is
the
way
we
live
i
am
very
glad
otherwise
i
would
not
have
told
the
story
for
it
is
not
exactly
right
that
i
should
i
am
very
glad
to
demonstrate
to
you
that
we
also
have
books
only
they
are
not
books
with
marks
in
them
but
words
in
our
hearts
which
have
been
placed
there
by
our
ancients
long
ago
even
so
long
ago
as
when
the
world
was
new
and
young
like
unripe
fruit
and
i
like
you
to
know
these
things
because
people
say
that
the
zuñis
are
dark
that
is
people
in
the
dark
having
no
knowledge

before

his

or

the
following
tale
was
told
by
an
attendant
indian
not
a
priest
whose
name
is
waíhusiwa
ah
tehi
he
exclaimed
which
may
be
interpreted
let
us
abide
with
the
ancients
the
listeners
reply
or
certainly
or
be
it
in
the
times
of
our
forefathers
under
thunder
mountain
was
a
village
called
k
iákime
home
of
the
eagles
it
is
now
in
ruins
the
roofs
are
gone
the
ladders
have
decayed
the
hearths
grown
cold
but
when
it
was
all
still
perfect
and
as
it
were
new
there
lived
in
this
village
a
maiden
the
daughter
of
the
she
was
beautiful
but
possessed
of
this
peculiarity
of
character
there
was
a
sacred
spring
of
water
at
the
foot
of
the
terrace
whereon
stood
the
town
we
now
call
it
the
pool
of
the
apaches
but
then
it
was
sacred
to
kólowissi
the
serpent
of
the
sea
now
at
this
spring
the
girl
displayed
her
peculiarity
which
was
that
of
a
passion
for
neatness
and
cleanliness
of
person
and
clothing
she
could
not
endure
the
slightest
speck
or
particle
of
dust
or
dirt
upon
her
clothes
or
person
and
so
she
spent
most
of
her
time
in
washing
all
the
things
she
used
and
in
bathing
herself
in
the
waters
of
this
spring
now
these
waters
being
sacred
to
the
serpent
of
the
sea
should
not
have
been
defiled
in
this
way
as
might
have
been
expected
kólowissi
became
troubled
and
angry
at
the
sacrilege
committed
in
the
sacred
waters
by
the
maiden
and
he
said
why
does
this
maiden
defile
the
sacred
waters
of
my
spring
with
the
dirt
of
her
apparel
and
the
dun
of
her
person
i
must
see
to
so
he
devised
a
plan
by
which
to
prevent
the
sacrilege
and
to
punish
its
author
when
the
maiden
came
again
to
the
spring
what
should
she
behold
but
a
beautiful
little
child
seated
amidst
the
waters
splashing
them
cooing
and
smiling
it
was
the
sea
serpent
wearing
the
semblance
of
a
child
for
a
god
may
assume
any
form
at
its
pleasure
you
know
there
sat
the
child
laughing
and
playing
in
the
water
the
girl
looked
around
in
all
directions
north
south
east
and
west
but
could
see
no
one
nor
any
traces
of
persons
who
might
have
brought
hither
the
beautiful
little
child
she
said
to
herself
i
wonder
whose
child
this
may
be
it
would
seem
to
be
that
of
some
unkind
and
cruel
mother
who
has
deserted
it
and
left
it
here
to
perish
and
the
poor
little
child
does
not
yet
know
that
it
is
left
all
alone
poor
little
thing
i
will
take
it
in
my
arms
and
care
for
the
maiden
then
talked
softly
to
the
young
child
and
took
it
in
her
arms
and
hastened
with
it
up
the
hill
to
her
house
and
climbing
up
the
ladder
carried
the
child
in
her
arms
into
the
room
where
she
slept
her
peculiarity
of
character
her
dislike
of
all
dirt
or
dust
led
her
to
dwell
apart
from
the
rest
of
her
family
in
a
room
by
herself
above
all
of
the
other
apartments
she
was
so
pleased
with
the
child
that
when
she
had
got
him
into
her
room
she
sat
down
on
the
floor
and
played
with
him
laughing
at
his
pranks
and
smiling
into
his
face
and
he
answered
her
in
baby
fashion
with
cooings
and
smiles
of
his
own
so
that
her
heart
became
very
happy
and
loving
so
it
happened
that
thus
was
she
engaged
for
a
long
while
and
utterly
unmindful
of
the
lapse
of
time
meanwhile
the
younger
sisters
had
prepared
the
meal
and
were
awaiting
the
return
of
the
elder
sister
where
i
wonder
can
she
be
one
of
them
asked
she
is
probably
down
at
the
spring
said
the
old
father
she
is
bathing
and
washing
her
clothes
as
usual
of
course
run
down
and
call
but
the
younger
sister
on
going
could
find
no
trace
of
her
at
the
spring
so
she
climbed
the
ladder
to
the
private
room
of
this
elder
sister
and
there
found
her
as
has
been
told
playing
with
the
little
child
she
hastened
back
to
inform
her
father
of
what
she
had
seen
but
the
old
man
sat
silent
and
thoughtful
he
knew
that
the
waters
of
the
spring
were
sacred
when
the
rest
of
the
family
were
excited
and
ran
to
behold
the
pretty
prodigy
he
cried
out
therefore
come
back
come
back
why
do
you
make
fools
of
yourselves
do
you
suppose
any
mother
would
leave
her
own
child
in
the
waters
of
this
or
any
other
spring
there
is
something
more
of
meaning
than
seems
in
all
when
they
again
went
and
called
the
maiden
to
come
down
to
the
meal
spread
for
her
she
could
not
be
induced
to
leave
the
child
see
it
is
as
you
might
expect
said
the
father
a
woman
will
not
leave
a
child
on
any
inducement
how
much
less
her
the
child
at
length
grew
sleepy
the
maiden
placed
it
on
a
bed
and
growing
sleepy
herself
at
length
lay
by
its
side
and
fell
asleep
her
sleep
was
genuine
but
the
sleep
of
the
child
was
feigned
the
child
became
elongated
by
degrees
as
it
were
fulfilling
some
horrible
dream
and
soon
appeared
as
an
enormous
serpent
that
coiled
itself
round
and
round
the
room
until
it
was
full
of
scaly
gleaming
circles
then
placing
its
head
near
the
head
of
the
maiden
the
great
serpent
surrounded
her
with
its
coils
taking
finally
its
own
tail
in
its
mouth
the
night
passed
and
in
the
morning
when
the
breakfast
was
prepared
and
yet
the
maiden
did
not
descend
and
the
younger
sisters
became
impatient
at
the
delay
the
old
man
said
now
that
she
has
the
child
to
play
with
she
will
care
little
for
aught
else
that
is
enough
to
occupy
the
entire
attention
of
any
but
the
little
sister
ran
up
to
the
room
and
called
receiving
no
answer
she
tried
to
open
the
door
she
could
not
move
it
because
the
serpent
s
coils
filled
the
room
and
pressed
against
it
she
pushed
the
door
with
all
her
might
but
it
could
not
be
moved
she
again
and
again
called
her
sister
s
name
but
no
response
came
beginning
now
to
be
frightened
she
ran
to
the
over
the
room
in
which
she
had
left
the
others
and
cried
out
for
help
they
hastily
joined
her
all
save
the
old
father
and
together
were
able
to
press
the
door
sufficiently
to
get
a
glimpse
of
the
great
scales
and
folds
of
the
serpent
then
the
women
all
ran
screaming
to
the
old
father
the
old
man
priest
and
sage
as
he
was
quieted
them
with
these
words
i
expected
as
much
as
this
from
the
first
report
which
you
gave
me
it
was
impossible
as
i
then
said
that
a
woman
should
be
so
foolish
as
to
leave
her
child
playing
even
near
the
waters
of
the
spring
but
it
is
not
impossible
it
seems
that
one
should
be
so
foolish
as
to
take
into
her
arms
a
child
found
as
this
one
thereupon
he
walked
out
of
the
house
deliberately
and
thoughtful
angry
in
his
mind
against
his
eldest
daughter
ascending
to
her
room
he
pushed
against
the
door
and
called
to
the
serpent
of
the
sea
oh
kólowissi
it
is
i
who
speak
to
thee
o
serpent
of
the
sea
i
thy
priest
let
i
pray
thee
let
my
child
come
to
me
again
and
i
will
make
atonement
for
her
errors
release
her
though
she
has
been
so
foolish
for
she
is
thine
absolutely
thine
but
let
her
return
once
more
to
us
that
we
may
make
atonement
to
thee
more
so
prayed
the
priest
to
the
serpent
of
the
sea
when
he
had
done
this
the
great
serpent
loosened
his
coils
and
as
he
did
so
the
whole
building
shook
violently
and
all
the
villagers
became
aware
of
the
event
and
trembled
with
fear
the
maiden
at
once
awoke
and
cried
piteously
to
her
father
for
help
come
and
release
me
oh
my
father
come
and
release
me
she
cried
as
the
coils
loosened
she
found
herself
able
to
rise
no
sooner
had
she
done
this
than
the
great
serpent
bent
the
folds
of
his
large
coils
nearest
the
doorway
upward
so
that
they
formed
an
arch
under
this
filled
with
terror
the
girl
passed
she
was
almost
stunned
with
the
dread
din
of
the
monster
s
scales
rasping
past
one
another
with
a
noise
like
the
sound
of
flints
trodden
under
the
feet
of
a
rapid
runner
and
once
away
from
the
writhing
mass
of
coils
the
poor
maiden
ran
like
a
frightened
deer
out
of
the
doorway
down
the
ladder
and
into
the
room
below
casting
herself
on
the
breast
of
her
mother
but
the
priest
still
remained
praying
to
the
serpent
and
he
ended
his
prayer
as
he
had
begun
it
saying
it
shall
be
even
as
i
have
said
she
shall
be
thine
he
then
went
away
and
called
the
two
warrior
of
the
town
and
these
called
together
all
the
other
priests
in
sacred
council
then
they
performed
the
solemn
ceremonies
of
the
sacred
rites
preparing
plumes
and
offerings
of
treasure
after
four
days
of
labor
these
things
they
arranged
and
consecrated
to
the
serpent
of
the
sea
on
that
morning
the
old
priest
called
his
daughter
and
told
her
she
must
make
ready
to
take
these
sacrifices
and
yield
them
up
even
with
herself
most
precious
of
them
all
to
the
great
serpent
of
the
sea
that
she
must
yield
up
also
all
thoughts
of
her
people
and
home
forever
and
go
hence
to
the
house
of
the
great
serpent
of
the
sea
even
in
the
waters
of
the
world
for
it
seems
said
he
to
have
been
your
desire
to
do
thus
as
manifested
by
your
actions
you
used
even
the
sacred
water
for
profane
purposes
now
this
that
i
have
told
you
is
inevitable
come
the
time
when
you
must
prepare
yourself
to
depart
is
near
at
she
went
forth
from
the
home
of
her
childhood
with
sad
cries
clinging
to
the
neck
of
her
mother
and
shivering
with
terror
in
the
plaza
amidst
the
lamentations
of
all
the
people
they
dressed
her
in
her
sacred
cotton
robes
of
ceremonial
embroidered
elaborately
and
adorned
her
with
earrings
bracelets
beads
many
beautiful
precious
things
they
painted
her
cheeks
with
red
spots
as
if
for
a
dance
they
made
a
road
of
sacred
meal
toward
the
door
of
the
serpent
of
the
sea
a
distant
spring
in
our
land
known
to
this
day
as
the
doorway
to
the
serpent
of
the
sea
four
steps
toward
this
spring
did
they
mark
in
sacred
terraces
on
the
ground
at
the
western
way
of
the
plaza
and
when
they
had
finished
the
sacred
road
the
old
priest
who
never
shed
one
tear
although
all
the
villagers
wept
sore
for
the
maiden
was
very
beautiful
instructed
his
daughter
to
go
forth
on
the
terraced
road
and
standing
there
call
the
serpent
to
come
to
her
then
the
door
opened
and
the
serpent
descended
from
the
high
room
where
he
was
coiled
and
without
using
ladders
let
his
head
and
breast
down
to
the
ground
in
great
undulations
he
placed
his
head
on
the
shoulder
of
the
maiden
and
the
word
was
given
the
word
it
is
time
and
the
maiden
slowly
started
toward
the
west
cowering
beneath
her
burden
but
whenever
she
staggered
with
fear
and
weariness
and
was
like
to
wander
from
the
way
the
serpent
gently
pushed
her
onward
and
straightened
her
course
thus
they
went
toward
the
river
trail
and
in
it
on
and
over
the
mountain
of
the
red
paint
yet
still
the
serpent
was
not
all
uncoiled
from
the
maiden
s
room
in
the
house
but
continued
to
crawl
forth
until
they
were
past
the
mountain
when
the
last
of
his
length
came
forth
here
he
began
to
draw
himself
together
again
and
to
assume
a
new
shape
so
that
ere
long
his
serpent
form
contracted
until
lifting
his
head
from
the
maiden
s
shoulder
he
stood
up
in
form
a
beautiful
youth
in
sacred
gala
attire
he
placed
the
scales
of
his
serpent
form
now
small
under
his
flowing
mantle
and
called
out
to
the
maiden
in
a
hoarse
hissing
voice
let
us
speak
one
to
the
other
are
you
tired
girl
yet
she
never
moved
her
head
but
plodded
on
with
her
eyes
cast
down
are
you
weary
poor
maiden
then
he
said
in
a
gentler
voice
as
he
arose
erect
and
fell
a
little
behind
her
and
wrapped
his
scales
more
closely
in
his
blanket
and
he
was
now
such
a
splendid
and
brave
hero
so
magnificently
dressed
and
he
repeated
in
a
still
softer
voice
are
you
still
weary
poor
maiden
at
first
she
dared
not
look
around
though
the
voice
so
changed
sounded
so
far
behind
her
and
thrilled
her
wonderfully
with
its
kindness
yet
she
still
felt
the
weight
on
her
shoulder
the
weight
of
that
dreaded
serpent
s
head
for
you
know
after
one
has
carried
a
heavy
burden
on
his
shoulder
or
back
if
it
be
removed
he
does
not
at
once
know
that
it
is
taken
away
it
seems
still
to
oppress
and
pain
him
so
it
was
with
her
but
at
length
she
turned
around
a
little
and
saw
a
young
man
a
brave
and
handsome
young
man
may
i
walk
by
your
side
said
he
catching
her
eye
why
do
you
not
speak
with
me
i
am
filled
with
fear
and
sadness
and
shame
said
she
why
asked
he
what
do
you
fear
because
i
came
with
a
fearful
creature
forth
from
my
home
and
he
rested
his
head
upon
my
shoulder
and
even
now
i
feel
his
presence
there
said
she
lifting
her
hand
to
the
place
where
his
head
had
rested
even
still
fearing
that
it
might
be
there
but
i
came
all
the
way
with
you
said
he
and
i
saw
no
such
creature
as
you
upon
this
she
stopped
and
turned
back
and
looked
again
at
him
and
said
you
came
all
the
way
i
wonder
where
this
fearful
being
has
gone
he
smiled
and
replied
i
know
where
he
has
ah
youth
and
friend
will
he
now
leave
me
in
peace
said
she
and
let
me
return
to
the
home
of
my
people
no
replied
he
because
he
thinks
very
much
of
why
not
where
is
he
he
is
here
said
the
youth
smiling
and
laying
his
hand
on
his
own
heart
i
am
you
are
he
cried
the
maiden
then
she
looked
at
him
again
and
would
not
believe
him
yea
my
maiden
i
am
he
said
he
and
he
drew
forth
from
under
his
flowing
mantle
the
shrivelled
serpent
scales
and
showed
them
as
proofs
of
his
word
it
was
wonderful
and
beautiful
to
the
maiden
to
see
that
he
was
thus
a
gentle
being
and
she
looked
at
him
long
then
he
said
yes
i
am
he
i
love
you
my
maiden
will
you
not
haply
come
forth
and
dwell
with
me
yes
you
will
go
with
me
and
dwell
with
me
and
i
will
dwell
with
you
and
i
will
love
you
i
dwell
not
now
but
ever
in
all
the
waters
of
the
world
and
in
each
particular
water
in
all
and
each
you
will
dwell
with
me
forever
and
we
will
love
each
behold
as
they
journeyed
on
the
maiden
quite
forgot
that
she
had
been
sad
she
forgot
her
old
home
and
followed
and
descended
with
him
into
the
doorway
of
the
serpent
of
the
sea
and
dwelt
with
him
ever
after
it
was
thus
in
the
days
of
the
ancients
therefore
the
ancients
no
less
than
ourselves
avoided
using
springs
except
for
the
drinking
of
their
water
for
to
this
day
we
hold
the
flowing
springs
the
most
precious
things
on
earth
and
therefore
use
them
not
for
any
profane
purposes
whatsoever
thus
shortens
my
story
the
maiden
of
the
yellow
rocks
in
the
days
of
the
ancients
when
our
ancestors
lived
in
the
village
of
the
yellow
rocks
also
in
the
salt
city
also
in
the
village
of
the
winds
and
also
in
the
village
of
the
white
flowering
herbs
and
also
in
the
village
of
odd
waters
where
they
come
forth
when
in
fact
all
these
villages
were
inhabited
by
our
ancients
there
lived
in
the
village
of
the
yellow
rocks
a
very
beautiful
maiden
the
daughter
of
the
high
priest
situated
about
seven
miles
east
of
zuñi
mátsaki
now
a
ruin
about
three
miles
east
of
zuñi
pínawa
an
ancient
ruin
about
a
mile
and
a
half
west
of
zuñi
although
a
woman
she
was
wonderfully
endowed
by
birth
with
the
magic
knowledge
of
the
hunt
and
with
the
knowledge
of
all
the
animals
who
contribute
to
the
sustenance
of
man
game
animals
and
although
a
woman
she
was
also
somewhat
bad
in
her
disposition
and
selfish
in
that
possessing
this
knowledge
above
all
other
men
and
women
she
concluded
she
would
have
all
these
animals
the
deer
antelope
rabbits
to
herself
so
through
her
wonderful
knowledge
of
their
habits
and
language
she
communicated
with
them
and
charmed
them
and
on
the
top
of
the
mountain
where
you
will
see
to
this
day
the
ancient
figures
of
the
deer
cut
in
the
rock
she
built
a
huge
corral
and
gathered
one
after
another
all
the
deer
and
antelope
and
other
wild
animals
of
that
great
country
and
the
hunters
of
these
villages
hunted
in
vain
they
trailed
the
deer
and
the
antelope
but
they
lost
their
trails
and
always
came
home
with
nothing
save
the
weapons
they
took
with
them
but
this
maiden
whenever
she
wished
for
deer
would
go
to
her
corral
and
kill
whatever
animal
she
wanted
so
she
and
her
family
always
had
plenty
of
meat
while
others
were
without
it
always
had
plenty
of
buckskins
with
which
to
make
moccasins
and
apparel
while
others
were
every
day
wearing
out
their
old
supply
and
never
able
to
replenish
it
now
this
girl
was
surpassingly
beautiful
and
was
looked
upon
by
many
a
young
man
as
the
flower
of
his
heart
and
the
one
on
whom
he
would
ultimately
concentrate
his
thoughts
for
life
amongst
these
young
men
the
first
to
manifest
his
feelings
was
a
youth
from
the
village
of
the
winds
one
day
he
said
to
his
old
people
i
am
going
and
they
observed
that
he
made
up
a
bundle
of
various
precious
things
for
women
s
dress
and
ornamentation
necklaces
buckskin
moccasins
and
leggings
and
embroidered
skirts
and
mantles
and
taking
his
bundle
on
his
shoulders
he
started
off
for
the
village
of
the
yellow
rocks
when
he
reached
the
village
he
knew
the
home
of
the
maiden
by
the
beauty
of
the
house
among
other
houses
it
was
alone
of
its
kind
attached
to
the
ladder
was
the
carved
as
it
is
in
these
days
but
depending
from
it
was
a
fringe
of
black
hair
not
with
which
they
still
ornament
certain
houses
when
they
have
sacred
ceremonies
and
among
this
fringe
were
hung
hollow
stalactites
from
a
sacred
cave
on
the
colorado
chiquito
which
sounded
when
the
wind
blew
them
together
like
little
bells
this
fringe
was
full
of
them
so
that
when
a
stranger
came
to
this
important
s
house
he
no
sooner
touched
the
at
the
foot
than
the
bells
tinkled
and
they
knew
some
one
was
coming
as
he
placed
his
foot
on
the
lowermost
rung
of
the
ladder
sang
the
bells
at
the
top
said
the
people
within
some
one
is
step
after
step
he
went
up
and
still
the
bells
made
music
at
the
top
and
as
he
stepped
over
on
the
roof
his
footsteps
sounded
as
he
walked
along
and
when
he
reached
the
door
those
within
said
thou
comest
and
he
replied
i
come
draw
me
in
by
which
expression
he
meant
that
he
had
brought
with
him
a
present
to
the
family
whenever
a
man
has
a
bundle
to
hand
down
it
is
the
place
of
the
woman
to
take
it
and
that
is
called
drawing
a
man
in
though
she
only
takes
his
bundle
and
he
follows
in
this
case
he
said
draw
me
in
and
the
maiden
came
to
the
top
of
the
ladder
and
took
the
bundle
and
dropped
it
on
the
floor
they
knew
by
the
appearance
of
the
bundle
what
the
object
of
the
visit
was
the
old
man
was
sitting
by
the
fireplace
it
was
and
as
the
stranger
entered
said
thou
hast
come
the
young
man
answered
said
the
old
man
it
is
not
customary
for
a
stranger
to
visit
the
house
of
a
stranger
without
saying
something
of
what
may
be
in
his
it
is
quite
true
said
the
youth
i
come
thinking
of
this
maiden
your
daughter
it
has
occurred
to
me
that
i
might
happily
and
without
fear
rest
my
thoughts
and
hopes
on
her
therefore
i
the
daughter
brought
forth
food
for
the
young
man
and
bade
him
eat
he
reached
forth
his
hand
and
partook
of
the
food
she
sat
down
and
took
a
mouthful
or
two
whereby
they
knew
she
was
favorably
disposed
she
was
favorably
disposed
to
all
appearance
but
not
in
reality
when
he
had
finished
eating
she
said
as
you
like
my
father
you
are
my
she
answered
to
her
own
thoughts
yes
you
have
often
reproached
me
for
not
treating
with
more
gentleness
those
who
come
courting
finally
said
the
father
i
give
ye
my
blessing
and
sacred
speech
my
children
i
will
adopt
thee
as
my
this
it
may
be
explained
is
all
that
the
marriage
ceremony
consists
of
my
children
said
the
father
after
a
while
when
he
had
smoked
a
little
the
stranger
now
a
son
has
come
a
long
distance
and
must
be
so
the
maiden
led
him
to
an
upper
chamber
and
said
rest
here
you
are
not
yet
my
husband
i
would
try
you
in
the
morning
get
up
early
when
the
deer
are
most
plentiful
and
go
forth
and
slay
me
a
fine
one
and
then
indeed
shall
we
rest
our
hopes
and
thoughts
on
each
other
for
it
is
well
said
the
youth
and
he
retired
to
sleep
and
in
the
morning
arose
early
the
maiden
gave
into
his
hands
the
food
for
the
day
he
caught
up
his
bows
and
arrows
and
went
forth
into
the
forests
and
mountains
seeking
for
the
deer
he
found
a
superb
track
and
followed
it
until
it
suddenly
disappeared
and
though
he
worked
hard
and
followed
it
over
and
over
again
he
could
find
nothing
while
the
young
man
was
out
hunting
and
following
the
tracks
for
nothing
the
young
girl
went
out
so
as
to
be
quite
sure
that
none
of
her
deer
should
get
out
and
what
did
she
do
she
went
into
the
river
and
followed
it
against
the
current
through
the
water
beyond
the
village
and
where
the
marked
rocks
stand
up
the
cañon
to
the
place
where
her
deer
were
gathered
they
were
all
there
peaceful
and
contented
but
there
were
no
tracks
of
the
girl
no
one
could
follow
where
she
went
the
young
man
hunted
and
hunted
and
at
all
tired
out
and
hungry
took
his
way
back
to
the
home
of
the
maiden
she
was
there
ha
said
she
what
good
fortune
today
and
the
young
man
with
his
face
dragged
down
and
his
eyes
not
bright
answered
i
found
no
game
well
said
the
girl
it
is
too
bad
but
under
the
circumstances
we
can
not
rest
our
thoughts
and
hopes
on
each
other
for
no
i
suppose
not
said
the
young
man
here
is
your
bundle
said
the
girl
she
raised
it
very
carefully
and
handed
it
to
him
he
took
it
over
his
shoulder
and
after
all
his
weary
work
went
on
his
way
home
the
very
next
day
a
young
man
named
hálona
when
he
heard
of
this
said
ha
ha
what
a
fool
he
was
he
didn
t
take
her
enough
presents
he
didn
t
please
her
i
am
said
to
be
a
very
pleasant
fellow
he
was
a
very
conceited
young
man
i
will
take
her
a
bundle
that
will
make
things
all
so
he
put
into
a
bundle
everything
that
a
woman
could
reasonably
want
for
he
was
a
wealthy
young
man
and
his
bundle
was
very
heavy
put
on
his
best
dress
and
with
fine
paint
on
his
face
started
for
the
home
of
the
maiden
finally
his
foot
touched
the
lowermost
rung
of
the
ladder
the
stalactites
went
jingling
above
as
he
mounted
and
went
his
bundle
as
he
dropped
it
on
the
roof
somebody
has
come
said
the
people
below
listen
to
that
the
maiden
shrugged
her
shoulders
and
said
thou
comest
yes
answered
the
young
man
draw
me
so
she
reached
up
and
pulled
the
huge
bundle
down
into
the
room
placing
it
on
the
floor
and
the
young
man
followed
it
down
said
the
old
man
who
was
sitting
by
the
fire
for
it
was
night
thou
comest
not
thinking
of
nothing
doth
one
stranger
come
to
the
house
of
another
what
may
be
thy
thoughts
the
young
man
looked
at
the
maiden
and
said
to
himself
what
a
magnificent
creature
she
is
she
will
be
my
wife
no
fear
that
she
will
then
said
he
aloud
i
came
thinking
of
your
daughter
i
would
rest
my
hopes
and
thoughts
on
it
is
well
said
the
old
man
it
is
the
custom
of
our
people
and
of
all
people
that
they
may
possess
dignity
that
they
may
be
the
heads
of
households
therefore
young
men
and
maidens
marry
and
establish
themselves
in
certain
houses
i
have
no
objection
what
dost
thou
think
my
daughter
i
have
no
objection
said
the
daughter
ah
what
did
i
tell
you
said
the
youth
to
himself
and
ate
with
a
great
deal
of
satisfaction
the
meal
placed
before
him
the
father
laid
out
the
and
tobacco
and
they
had
a
smoke
then
he
said
to
his
daughter
the
stranger
who
is
now
my
son
has
come
a
long
way
and
should
not
be
kept
sitting
up
so
as
the
daughter
led
him
to
another
room
he
thought
what
a
gentle
creature
she
is
how
softly
she
steps
up
the
when
the
door
was
reached
she
said
here
we
will
say
what
is
the
matter
he
asked
said
she
i
would
like
to
know
of
my
husband
this
much
that
he
is
a
good
hunter
that
i
may
have
plenty
of
food
all
my
days
and
plenty
of
buckskins
for
my
clothing
therefore
i
must
ask
that
in
the
morning
you
go
forth
and
hunt
the
deer
or
bring
home
an
antelope
for
the
young
man
quickly
recovered
himself
and
said
it
is
well
and
lay
himself
down
to
rest
so
the
next
morning
he
went
out
and
there
was
the
maiden
at
the
top
of
the
house
watching
him
he
couldn
t
wait
for
daylight
he
wanted
the
sun
his
father
to
rise
before
his
time
and
when
the
sun
did
rise
he
jumped
out
of
bed
tied
his
quiver
to
his
belt
took
his
bow
in
his
hand
and
with
a
little
luncheon
the
maiden
had
prepared
for
him
started
off
as
he
went
down
the
river
he
saw
the
maiden
was
watching
him
from
the
top
of
the
house
so
he
started
forward
and
ran
until
he
was
out
of
sight
to
show
how
fine
a
runner
he
was
and
how
good
a
hunter
because
he
was
reputed
to
be
a
very
strong
and
active
young
man
he
hunted
and
hunted
but
did
not
find
any
deer
nor
even
any
tracks
meanwhile
the
maiden
went
up
the
stream
as
before
and
kept
watch
of
the
corral
and
he
fared
as
the
other
young
man
had
fared
at
night
he
came
home
not
quite
so
downcast
as
the
other
had
been
because
he
was
a
young
man
of
more
she
asked
as
she
met
him
haven
t
you
got
any
deer
today
he
answered
she
said
i
am
sorry
but
under
the
circumstances
i
don
t
see
how
we
can
become
husband
and
so
he
carried
his
bundle
home
the
next
day
there
was
a
young
man
in
the
city
of
salt
who
heard
of
this
not
all
of
it
but
he
heard
that
day
after
day
young
men
were
going
to
the
home
of
this
maiden
to
court
her
and
she
turned
them
all
away
he
said
i
dare
say
they
didn
t
take
enough
with
so
he
made
up
two
bundles
and
went
to
the
home
of
the
maiden
and
he
said
to
himself
this
time
it
will
be
all
when
he
arrived
much
the
same
conversation
was
gone
through
as
before
with
the
other
young
men
and
the
girl
said
when
she
lighted
him
to
the
door
of
his
room
my
young
friend
if
you
will
find
a
deer
for
me
tomorrow
i
will
become
your
wife
and
rest
my
hope
only
on
mercy
on
me
thought
the
young
man
to
himself
i
have
always
been
called
a
poor
hunter
what
shall
i
do
the
next
morning
he
tried
but
with
the
same
results
now
this
girl
was
keeping
the
deer
and
antelope
and
other
animals
so
long
closed
up
in
the
corral
that
the
people
in
all
the
villages
round
about
were
ready
to
die
of
hunger
for
meat
still
for
her
own
gratification
she
would
keep
these
animals
shut
up
the
young
man
came
back
at
evening
and
she
asked
him
if
he
had
found
a
deer
for
her
no
said
he
i
could
not
even
find
the
trail
of
well
she
said
i
am
sorry
for
your
bundles
are
he
took
them
up
and
went
home
with
them
finally
this
matter
became
so
much
talked
about
that
the
two
small
gods
on
the
top
of
thunder
mountain
who
lived
with
their
grandmother
where
our
sacrificial
altar
now
stands
said
there
is
something
wrong
here
we
will
go
and
court
this
now
these
gods
were
extremely
ugly
in
appearance
when
they
chose
to
be
mere
pigmies
who
never
grew
to
man
s
stature
they
were
always
boys
in
appearance
and
their
grandmother
was
always
crusty
with
them
but
they
concluded
one
night
that
they
would
go
the
next
day
to
woo
this
maiden
said
one
to
the
other
suppose
we
go
and
try
our
luck
with
said
he
when
i
look
at
you
you
are
very
said
the
other
to
him
when
i
look
at
you
you
are
extremely
they
were
the
ugliest
beings
in
human
form
but
in
reality
were
among
the
most
magnificent
of
men
having
power
to
take
any
form
they
chose
said
the
elder
one
grandmother
you
know
how
much
talk
there
is
about
this
maiden
in
the
village
of
the
yellow
rocks
we
have
decided
to
go
and
court
you
miserable
dirty
ugly
little
wretches
the
idea
of
your
going
to
court
this
maiden
when
she
has
refused
the
finest
young
men
in
the
land
well
we
will
go
said
he
i
don
t
want
you
to
go
replied
she
your
names
will
be
in
the
mouths
of
everybody
you
will
be
laughed
and
jeered
we
will
go
said
they
and
without
paying
the
slightest
attention
to
their
grandmother
they
made
up
their
bundle
a
very
miserable
bundle
it
was
the
younger
brother
put
in
little
rocks
and
sticks
and
bits
of
buckskins
and
all
sorts
of
worthless
things
and
they
started
off
what
are
you
carrying
this
bundle
for
asked
áhaiyúta
the
elder
brother
i
am
taking
it
as
a
present
to
the
maiden
said
mátsailéma
the
younger
one
she
doesn
t
want
any
such
trash
as
that
said
the
other
they
have
taken
very
valuable
presents
to
her
before
we
have
nothing
to
take
equal
to
what
has
been
carried
to
her
by
they
decided
to
throw
the
bundle
away
altogether
and
started
out
with
absolutely
nothing
but
their
bows
and
arrows
as
they
proceeded
they
began
to
kill
and
continued
until
they
had
slaughtered
a
large
number
and
had
a
long
string
of
them
held
up
by
their
tails
there
exclaimed
the
younger
brother
there
is
a
fine
present
for
the
they
knew
perfectly
well
how
things
were
and
were
looking
out
for
the
interests
of
their
children
in
the
villages
round
about
oh
my
younger
brother
said
the
elder
these
will
not
be
acceptable
to
the
girl
at
all
she
would
not
have
them
in
the
house
oh
yes
she
would
said
the
younger
we
will
take
them
along
as
a
present
to
so
they
went
on
and
it
was
hardly
noon
when
they
arrived
with
their
strings
of
rats
at
the
white
cliffs
on
the
southern
side
of
the
cañon
opposite
the
village
where
the
maiden
lived
here
let
us
sit
down
in
the
shade
of
this
cliff
said
the
elder
brother
for
it
is
not
proper
to
go
courting
until
oh
no
said
the
younger
let
us
go
along
now
i
am
in
a
hurry
i
am
in
a
hurry
you
are
a
fool
said
the
elder
brother
you
should
not
think
of
going
courting
before
evening
stay
here
so
they
sat
down
in
the
shade
of
the
cliff
but
the
younger
kept
jumping
up
and
running
out
to
see
how
the
sun
was
all
the
afternoon
and
he
would
go
and
smooth
out
his
string
of
rats
from
time
to
time
and
then
go
and
look
at
the
sun
again
finally
when
the
sun
was
almost
set
he
called
out
now
come
on
wait
until
it
is
wholly
dark
said
the
other
you
never
did
have
any
patience
sense
or
dignity
about
why
not
go
now
asked
the
younger
so
they
kept
quarrelling
but
the
elder
brother
s
wish
prevailed
until
it
was
nearly
dark
when
they
went
on
the
elder
brother
began
to
get
very
bashful
as
they
approached
the
village
i
wonder
which
house
it
is
said
he
the
one
with
the
tallest
ladder
in
front
of
it
of
course
said
the
other
then
the
elder
brother
said
in
a
low
voice
now
do
behave
yourself
be
all
right
replied
the
younger
when
they
got
to
the
ladder
the
elder
one
said
in
a
whisper
i
don
t
want
to
go
up
here
i
don
t
want
to
go
courting
let
s
go
go
along
up
said
the
younger
keep
still
be
quiet
said
the
elder
one
be
dignified
they
went
up
the
ladder
very
carefully
so
that
there
was
not
a
tinkle
from
the
bells
the
elder
brother
hesitated
while
the
younger
one
went
on
to
the
top
and
over
the
edge
of
the
house
now
cried
he
keep
still
whispered
the
other
and
he
gave
the
ladder
a
little
shake
as
he
went
and
the
bells
tinkled
at
the
top
the
people
downstairs
said
who
in
the
world
is
coming
now
when
they
were
both
on
the
roof
the
elder
brother
said
you
go
down
i
will
do
nothing
of
the
kind
said
the
other
you
are
the
the
people
downstairs
called
out
who
comes
there
see
what
you
have
done
you
simpleton
said
the
elder
brother
then
with
a
great
deal
of
dignity
he
walked
down
the
ladder
the
younger
one
came
tumbling
down
carrying
his
string
of
rats
throw
it
out
you
fool
they
don
t
want
rats
said
the
elder
one
yes
they
do
replied
the
other
the
girl
will
want
these
maybe
she
will
marry
us
on
account
of
them
the
elder
brother
was
terribly
disturbed
but
the
other
brought
his
rats
in
and
laid
them
in
the
middle
of
the
floor
the
father
looked
up
and
said
you
come
yes
answered
the
two
odd
ones
sit
down
said
the
old
man
so
they
sat
down
and
food
was
placed
before
them
it
seems
said
the
father
that
ye
have
met
with
luck
today
in
hunting
as
he
cast
his
eyes
on
the
string
of
rats
yes
said
the
two
so
the
old
priest
went
and
got
some
and
turning
the
faces
of
the
rats
toward
the
east
said
a
short
prayer
what
did
i
tell
you
said
the
younger
brother
they
like
the
presents
we
have
brought
just
see
presently
the
old
man
said
it
is
not
customary
for
strangers
to
come
to
a
house
without
something
in
quite
so
said
the
younger
brother
yes
my
father
said
the
elder
one
we
have
come
thinking
of
your
daughter
we
understand
that
she
has
been
wooed
by
various
young
men
and
it
has
occurred
to
us
that
they
did
not
bring
the
right
kind
of
so
we
brought
these
said
the
younger
brother
it
is
well
said
the
old
man
it
is
the
custom
for
maidens
and
youths
to
marry
it
rests
with
my
so
he
referred
the
matter
to
his
daughter
and
she
said
as
you
think
my
father
which
one
oh
take
us
both
said
the
younger
brother
this
was
rather
embarrassing
to
the
maiden
but
she
knew
she
had
a
safe
retreat
so
when
the
father
admonished
her
that
it
was
time
to
lead
the
two
young
men
up
into
the
room
where
the
others
had
been
placed
she
told
them
the
same
story
they
said
it
is
they
lay
down
but
instead
of
sleeping
spent
most
of
the
night
in
speculating
as
to
the
future
what
a
magnificent
wife
we
will
have
said
one
to
the
other
don
t
talk
so
loud
every
one
will
hear
you
you
will
be
covered
with
shame
after
a
while
they
went
to
sleep
but
were
awake
early
the
next
morning
the
younger
brother
began
to
talk
to
the
elder
one
who
said
keep
quiet
the
people
are
not
awake
don
t
disturb
them
the
younger
one
said
the
sun
is
keep
quiet
said
the
other
and
when
they
are
awake
they
will
give
us
some
luncheon
to
take
with
but
the
younger
one
jumped
up
and
went
rushing
about
the
house
calling
out
the
sun
is
rising
get
up
the
luncheon
was
provided
and
when
they
started
off
the
maiden
went
out
on
the
and
asked
them
which
direction
they
would
take
said
they
we
will
go
over
to
the
south
and
will
get
a
deer
before
long
although
we
are
very
small
and
may
not
meet
with
very
good
so
they
descended
the
ladder
and
the
maiden
said
to
herself
ugly
miserable
little
wretches
i
will
teach
them
to
come
courting
me
in
this
way
the
brothers
went
off
to
the
cliffs
and
while
pretending
to
be
hunting
they
ran
back
through
the
thickets
near
the
house
and
waited
to
see
what
the
maiden
would
do
pretty
soon
she
came
out
they
watched
her
and
saw
that
she
went
down
the
valley
and
presently
ran
into
the
river
leaving
no
trail
behind
and
took
her
course
up
the
stream
they
ran
on
ahead
and
long
before
she
had
ascended
the
river
found
the
path
leading
out
of
it
up
the
mountain
following
this
path
they
came
to
the
corral
and
looking
over
it
they
saw
thousands
of
deer
antelope
and
other
animals
wandering
around
in
the
enclosure
ha
here
is
the
place
the
younger
brother
exclaimed
let
us
go
at
them
now
keep
quiet
be
patient
wait
till
the
maiden
comes
said
the
elder
one
if
we
should
happen
to
kill
one
of
these
deer
before
she
comes
perhaps
she
has
some
magic
power
or
knowledge
by
which
she
would
deprive
us
of
the
fruits
of
our
no
let
us
kill
one
now
said
the
other
but
the
elder
one
kept
him
curbed
until
the
maiden
was
climbing
the
cliff
when
he
could
restrain
him
no
longer
and
the
youth
pulled
out
his
bow
and
let
fly
an
arrow
at
the
largest
deer
one
arrow
and
the
deer
fell
to
the
ground
and
when
the
maiden
appeared
on
the
spot
the
deer
was
lying
dead
not
far
away
the
brothers
said
you
come
do
you
and
here
we
are
she
looked
at
them
and
her
heart
went
down
and
became
as
heavy
as
a
stone
and
she
did
not
answer
i
say
you
come
said
the
younger
brother
you
come
do
you
she
said
then
said
she
to
herself
well
i
suppose
i
shall
have
to
submit
as
i
made
the
arrangement
then
she
looked
up
and
said
i
see
you
have
killed
a
yes
we
killed
one
didn
t
have
any
difficulty
at
all
said
the
younger
brother
come
and
help
us
skin
him
we
are
so
little
and
hungry
and
tired
we
can
t
do
it
come
so
the
girl
went
slowly
forward
and
in
a
dejected
way
helped
them
skin
the
deer
then
they
began
to
shoot
more
deer
and
attempted
to
drag
them
out
but
the
men
were
so
small
they
could
not
do
it
and
the
girl
had
to
help
them
then
they
cut
up
the
meat
and
made
it
into
bundles
she
made
a
large
one
for
herself
and
they
made
two
little
ones
for
themselves
now
said
they
wiping
their
brows
we
have
done
a
good
day
s
work
haven
t
we
and
they
looked
at
the
maiden
with
twinkling
eyes
yes
said
she
you
are
great
shall
we
go
toward
home
asked
the
younger
brother
of
the
maiden
it
would
be
a
shame
for
you
to
take
such
a
bundle
as
that
i
will
take
it
for
you
little
conceited
wretch
cried
the
elder
brother
haven
t
i
tried
to
restrain
you
and
now
you
are
going
to
bury
yourself
under
a
bundle
of
meat
no
said
the
younger
brother
i
can
carry
so
they
propped
the
great
bundle
of
meat
against
a
tree
the
elder
brother
called
on
the
maiden
to
help
him
the
younger
one
stooped
down
and
received
it
on
his
back
they
had
no
sooner
let
go
of
it
than
it
fell
on
the
ground
and
completely
flattened
the
little
man
out
mercy
mercy
i
am
dying
help
me
out
of
here
cried
he
so
they
managed
to
roll
the
thing
off
and
he
got
up
and
rubbed
his
back
complaining
bitterly
he
was
only
making
believe
and
said
i
shall
have
to
take
my
little
so
he
shouldered
his
little
bundle
and
the
maiden
took
the
large
one
but
before
she
started
she
turned
to
the
animals
and
said
oh
my
children
these
many
days
throwing
the
warm
light
of
your
favor
upon
me
you
have
rested
contented
to
remain
away
from
the
sight
of
men
now
hereafter
you
shall
go
forth
whithersoever
you
will
that
the
earth
may
be
covered
with
your
offspring
and
men
may
once
more
have
of
your
flesh
to
eat
and
of
your
pelts
to
and
away
went
the
antelope
the
deer
the
the
elk
and
the
buffalo
over
all
the
land
then
the
young
gods
of
war
turned
to
the
maiden
and
said
now
shall
we
go
home
yes
said
she
well
i
will
take
the
lead
said
the
younger
brother
get
behind
where
you
belong
said
the
other
i
will
precede
the
so
the
elder
brother
went
first
the
maiden
came
next
and
the
younger
brother
followed
behind
with
his
little
bag
of
meat
so
they
went
home
and
the
maiden
placed
the
meat
to
dry
in
the
upper
rooms
of
the
house
while
she
was
doing
this
it
was
yet
early
in
the
day
the
two
brothers
were
sitting
together
and
whispering
and
what
will
she
say
for
herself
now
i
don
t
see
what
she
can
say
for
of
course
nothing
can
she
say
for
and
when
the
meat
was
all
packed
away
in
the
house
and
the
sun
had
set
they
sat
by
themselves
talking
this
over
what
can
she
say
for
herself
nothing
whatever
nothing
remains
to
be
that
is
quite
so
said
they
as
they
went
in
to
the
evening
meal
and
sat
with
the
family
to
eat
it
finally
the
maiden
said
with
all
your
hunting
and
the
labors
of
the
day
you
must
be
very
weary
where
you
slept
last
night
you
will
find
a
go
and
rest
yourselves
i
can
not
consent
to
marry
you
because
you
have
not
yet
shown
yourselves
capable
of
taking
care
of
and
dressing
the
buckskins
as
well
as
of
killing
deer
and
antelope
and
such
animals
for
a
long
time
buckskins
have
been
accumulating
in
the
upper
room
i
have
no
brothers
to
soften
and
scrape
them
therefore
if
you
two
will
take
the
hair
off
from
all
my
buckskins
tomorrow
before
sunset
and
scrape
the
underside
so
that
they
will
be
thin
and
soft
i
will
consent
to
be
the
wife
of
one
of
you
or
and
they
said
oh
mercy
it
is
too
bad
we
can
never
do
it
said
the
younger
brother
i
don
t
suppose
we
can
but
we
can
try
said
the
elder
so
they
lay
down
let
us
take
things
in
time
said
the
elder
one
after
he
had
thought
of
it
and
they
jumped
up
and
called
to
the
maiden
where
are
those
buckskins
they
are
in
the
upper
room
said
she
she
showed
them
the
way
to
the
upper
room
it
was
packed
to
the
rafters
with
buckskins
they
began
to
make
big
bales
of
these
and
then
took
them
down
to
the
river
when
they
got
them
all
down
there
they
said
how
in
the
world
can
we
scrape
so
many
skins
there
are
more
here
than
we
can
clean
in
a
i
will
tell
you
what
said
the
younger
brother
we
will
stow
away
some
in
the
crevices
of
the
rocks
and
get
rid
of
them
in
that
always
hasty
always
hasty
said
the
elder
do
you
suppose
that
woman
put
those
skins
away
without
counting
every
one
of
them
we
can
t
do
they
spread
them
out
in
the
water
that
they
might
soak
all
night
and
built
a
little
dam
so
they
would
not
float
away
while
they
were
thus
engaged
they
heard
some
one
talking
so
they
pricked
up
their
ears
to
listen
now
the
hill
that
stands
by
the
side
across
from
the
village
of
the
yellow
rocks
was
and
still
is
a
favorite
home
of
the
they
are
very
prolific
and
have
to
provide
great
bundles
of
wool
for
their
families
but
in
the
days
of
the
ancients
they
were
terrible
gamblers
and
were
all
the
time
betting
away
their
nests
and
the
young
mice
being
perfectly
bare
with
no
wool
on
them
at
all
died
of
cold
and
still
they
kept
on
betting
making
little
figures
of
nests
and
betting
these
away
against
the
time
when
they
should
have
more
it
was
these
mice
which
the
two
gods
overheard
said
the
younger
brother
listen
to
that
who
is
talking
some
one
is
betting
let
us
go
they
went
across
the
river
and
listened
and
heard
the
tiny
little
voices
calling
out
and
shouting
let
us
go
in
said
the
younger
brother
and
he
placed
his
foot
in
the
hole
and
descended
followed
by
the
other
they
found
there
an
enormous
village
of
in
human
form
their
clothes
in
the
shape
of
mice
hanging
over
the
sides
of
the
house
some
had
their
clothing
all
off
down
to
their
waists
and
were
betting
as
hard
as
they
could
and
talking
with
one
another
as
soon
as
the
two
brothers
entered
they
said
who
comes
the
two
answered
we
come
in
come
in
cried
the
mice
they
were
not
very
polite
sit
down
and
have
a
game
we
have
not
anything
to
bet
just
now
but
if
you
trust
us
we
will
bet
with
what
had
you
in
mind
in
coming
said
an
old
with
a
broken
tail
they
answered
that
they
had
come
because
they
heard
voices
then
they
told
their
story
what
is
this
you
have
to
do
asked
the
mice
to
clean
all
the
hair
off
those
pelts
the
mice
looked
around
at
one
another
their
eyes
fairly
sparkled
and
burned
now
then
we
will
help
you
if
you
will
promise
us
something
said
they
but
we
want
your
solemn
what
is
that
asked
the
brothers
that
you
will
give
us
all
the
oh
yes
said
the
brothers
we
will
be
glad
to
get
rid
of
all
right
said
they
where
are
the
skins
then
they
all
began
to
pour
out
of
the
place
and
they
were
so
numerous
that
it
was
like
water
when
the
rain
is
falling
hard
running
over
a
rock
when
they
had
all
run
out
the
two
drew
the
skins
on
the
bank
and
the
went
to
nibbling
the
hair
and
cleaning
off
the
underside
they
made
up
little
bundles
of
the
flesh
from
the
skins
for
their
food
and
great
parcels
of
the
hair
finally
they
said
may
we
have
them
all
no
said
the
brothers
we
must
have
eight
reserved
four
for
each
so
that
we
will
be
hard
at
work
all
day
well
said
the
mice
we
can
t
consent
to
leaving
even
so
many
unless
you
promise
that
you
will
gather
up
all
the
hair
and
put
it
somewhere
so
that
we
can
get
the
two
promised
that
and
said
be
sure
to
leave
eight
skins
will
you
and
we
will
go
to
bed
and
rest
all
right
all
right
responded
the
so
the
brothers
climbed
up
the
hill
to
the
town
and
up
the
ladder
and
slept
in
their
room
the
next
morning
the
girl
said
now
remember
you
will
have
to
clean
every
skin
and
make
it
soft
and
so
they
went
down
to
the
river
and
started
to
work
the
girl
had
said
to
them
that
at
midday
she
would
go
down
and
see
how
they
were
getting
along
they
were
at
work
nearly
all
the
forenoon
on
the
skins
while
the
elder
brother
shaved
the
hair
off
the
younger
one
scraped
them
thin
and
softened
them
when
the
maiden
came
at
noon
she
said
how
are
you
getting
along
we
have
finished
four
and
are
at
work
on
the
remember
said
she
you
must
finish
all
of
them
today
or
i
shall
have
to
send
you
so
they
worked
away
until
a
little
before
the
sun
set
when
she
appeared
again
they
had
just
finished
the
last
the
had
carefully
dressed
all
the
others
they
did
it
better
than
the
men
and
there
they
lay
spread
out
on
the
sands
like
a
great
field
of
something
growing
only
white
when
the
maiden
came
down
she
was
perfectly
overcome
she
looked
and
looked
and
counted
and
recounted
she
found
them
all
there
then
she
got
a
long
pole
and
fished
in
the
water
but
there
were
none
said
she
yes
you
shall
be
my
husbands
i
shall
have
to
she
went
home
with
them
and
for
a
long
time
they
all
lived
together
the
woman
with
her
two
husbands
they
managed
to
get
along
very
comfortably
and
the
two
brothers
didn
t
quarrel
any
more
than
they
had
done
before
finally
there
were
born
little
twin
boys
exactly
like
their
fathers
who
were
also
twins
although
one
was
called
the
elder
and
the
other
the
younger
after
a
time
the
younger
brother
said
now
let
us
go
home
to
our
grandmother
people
always
go
home
to
their
own
houses
and
take
their
families
with
no
said
the
elder
one
you
must
remember
that
we
have
been
only
pretending
to
be
human
beings
it
would
not
do
to
take
the
maiden
home
with
yes
said
the
other
i
want
her
to
go
with
us
our
grandmother
kept
making
fun
of
us
called
us
little
miserable
wretched
creatures
i
want
to
show
her
that
we
amount
to
something
the
elder
brother
could
not
get
the
younger
one
to
leave
the
wife
behind
and
like
a
dutiful
wife
she
said
i
will
go
with
they
made
up
their
bundles
and
started
out
it
was
a
very
hot
day
and
when
they
had
climbed
nearly
to
the
top
of
thunder
mountain
the
younger
brother
said
ahem
i
am
tired
let
us
sit
down
and
it
will
not
do
said
the
elder
brother
you
know
very
well
it
will
not
do
to
sit
down
our
father
the
sun
has
forbidden
that
we
should
be
among
mortals
it
will
not
oh
yes
it
will
we
must
sit
down
here
said
the
younger
brother
and
again
his
wish
prevailed
and
they
sat
down
at
midday
the
sun
stood
still
in
the
sky
and
looked
down
and
saw
this
beautiful
woman
and
by
the
power
of
his
withdrawing
rays
quickly
snatched
her
from
them
while
they
were
sitting
there
talking
she
carrying
her
little
children
the
brothers
looked
around
and
said
where
is
our
wife
ah
there
she
is
cried
the
younger
i
will
shoot
shoot
your
wife
cried
the
elder
brother
no
let
her
go
serves
you
right
no
said
the
younger
i
will
shoot
her
he
looked
up
and
drew
his
arrow
and
as
his
aim
was
absolutely
unerring
went
the
arrow
directly
to
her
and
she
was
killed
the
power
of
life
by
which
the
sun
was
drawing
her
up
was
gone
the
thread
was
cut
and
she
fell
over
and
over
and
struck
the
earth
the
two
little
children
were
so
very
small
and
their
bones
so
soft
that
the
fall
did
not
hurt
them
much
they
fell
on
the
soft
bank
and
rolled
and
rolled
down
the
hill
and
the
younger
brother
ran
forward
and
caught
them
up
in
his
arms
crying
oh
my
little
children
and
brought
them
to
the
elder
brother
who
said
now
what
can
be
done
with
these
little
babies
with
no
mother
no
food
we
will
take
them
home
to
grandmother
said
the
younger
brother
your
grandmother
can
not
take
care
of
these
babies
said
the
elder
brother
yes
she
can
of
course
said
the
younger
brother
come
on
come
on
i
didn
t
want
to
lose
my
wife
and
children
too
i
thought
i
must
still
have
the
children
that
is
the
reason
why
i
shot
so
one
of
them
took
one
of
the
children
and
the
other
one
took
the
other
and
they
carried
them
up
to
the
top
of
thunder
mountain
now
then
said
the
elder
brother
we
went
off
to
marry
we
come
home
with
no
wife
and
two
little
children
and
with
nothing
to
feed
oh
grandmother
called
out
the
younger
brother
the
old
woman
hadn
t
heard
them
for
many
a
day
for
many
a
month
even
for
years
she
looked
out
and
said
my
grandchildren
are
coming
and
she
called
to
them
i
am
so
glad
you
have
come
here
see
what
we
have
said
the
younger
brother
here
are
your
grandchildren
come
and
take
them
oh
you
miserable
boy
you
are
always
doing
something
foolish
where
is
your
wife
asked
the
grandmother
oh
i
shot
her
was
the
response
why
did
you
do
that
i
didn
t
want
my
father
the
sun
to
take
them
away
with
my
wife
i
knew
you
would
not
care
anything
about
my
wife
but
i
knew
you
would
be
very
fond
of
the
grandchildren
here
they
but
she
wouldn
t
look
at
all
so
the
younger
brother
drew
his
face
down
and
taking
the
poor
little
children
in
his
arms
said
you
unnatural
grandmother
you
here
are
two
nice
little
grandchildren
for
you
she
said
how
shall
i
feed
them
or
what
shall
i
do
with
them
he
replied
oh
take
care
of
them
take
care
of
them
she
took
a
good
look
at
them
and
became
a
true
grandmother
she
ran
and
clasped
the
little
ones
crying
out
let
me
take
you
away
from
these
miserable
children
of
mine
she
made
some
beds
of
sand
for
them
as
zuñi
mothers
do
today
got
some
soft
skins
for
them
to
lie
on
and
fed
them
with
a
kind
of
milk
made
of
corn
toasted
and
ground
and
mixed
with
water
so
that
they
gradually
enlarged
and
grew
up
to
be
nice
children
thus
it
was
in
the
days
of
the
ancients
and
has
been
told
to
us
in
these
days
that
even
the
most
cruel
and
heartless
of
the
gods
do
these
things
even
they
took
these
helpless
children
to
their
grandmother
and
she
succored
them
and
brought
them
up
to
the
time
of
reason
therefore
it
is
the
duty
of
those
who
find
helpless
babies
or
children
inasmuch
as
they
are
not
so
cruel
and
terrible
as
were
the
gods
of
war
not
nearly
surely
it
is
their
duty
to
take
those
children
and
succor
and
bring
them
up
to
the
time
of
reason
when
they
can
care
for
themselves
that
is
why
our
people
when
children
have
been
abandoned
provide
and
care
for
them
as
if
they
were
their
own
thus
long
is
my
story
the
of
the
deer
once
long
long
ago
at
háwikuh
there
lived
a
maiden
most
beautiful
in
her
earlier
years
her
father
who
was
a
great
priest
had
devoted
her
to
sacred
things
and
therefore
he
kept
her
always
in
the
house
secure
from
the
gaze
of
all
men
and
thus
she
grew
she
was
so
beautiful
that
when
the
sun
looked
down
along
one
of
the
straight
beams
of
his
own
light
if
one
of
those
beams
chanced
to
pass
through
a
chink
in
the
roof
the
or
the
windows
of
the
upper
part
of
the
maiden
s
room
he
beheld
her
and
wondered
at
her
rare
beauty
unable
to
compare
it
with
anything
he
saw
in
his
great
journeys
round
about
the
worlds
thus
as
the
maiden
grew
apace
and
became
a
young
woman
the
sun
loved
her
exceedingly
and
as
time
went
on
he
became
so
enamored
of
her
that
he
descended
to
earth
and
entered
on
one
of
his
own
beams
of
light
into
her
apartment
so
that
suddenly
while
she
was
sitting
one
weaving
pretty
baskets
there
stood
before
her
a
glorious
youth
gloriously
dressed
it
was
the
he
looked
upon
her
gently
and
lovingly
she
looked
upon
him
not
fearfully
and
so
it
came
about
that
she
loved
him
and
he
loved
her
and
he
won
her
to
be
his
wife
and
many
were
the
days
in
which
he
visited
her
and
dwelt
with
her
for
a
space
at
but
as
she
was
alone
mostly
or
as
she
kept
sitting
weaving
her
trays
when
any
one
of
the
family
entered
her
apartment
no
one
suspected
this
illustration
a
burro
train
in
a
zuñi
street
photo
by
hillers
now
as
she
knew
that
she
had
been
devoted
to
sacred
things
and
that
if
she
explained
how
it
was
that
she
was
a
mother
she
would
not
be
believed
she
was
greatly
exercised
in
mind
and
heart
she
therefore
decided
that
when
her
child
was
born
she
would
put
it
away
from
her
when
the
time
came
the
child
one
night
was
born
she
carefully
wrapped
the
little
baby
boy
in
some
soft
and
in
the
middle
of
the
night
stole
out
softly
over
the
and
silently
descending
laid
the
child
on
the
sheltered
side
of
a
heap
of
refuse
near
the
little
stream
that
flows
by
háwikuh
in
the
valley
below
then
mourning
as
a
mother
will
mourn
for
her
offspring
she
returned
to
her
room
and
lay
herself
down
poor
thing
to
rest
as
daylight
was
breaking
in
the
east
and
the
hills
and
the
valleys
were
coming
forth
one
after
another
from
the
shadows
of
night
a
deer
with
her
two
little
fawns
descended
from
the
hills
to
the
south
across
the
valley
with
ears
and
eyes
alert
and
stopped
at
the
stream
to
drink
while
drinking
they
were
startled
by
an
infant
s
cry
and
looking
up
they
saw
dust
and
and
other
things
flying
about
in
the
air
almost
as
if
a
little
whirlwind
were
blowing
on
the
site
of
the
where
the
child
had
been
laid
it
was
the
child
who
waking
and
finding
itself
alone
hungry
and
cold
was
crying
and
throwing
its
little
hands
about
bless
my
delight
cried
the
deer
to
her
fawns
i
have
this
day
found
a
waif
a
child
and
though
it
be
human
it
shall
be
mine
for
see
my
children
i
love
you
so
much
that
surely
i
could
love
thereupon
she
approached
the
little
infant
and
breathed
her
warm
breath
upon
it
and
caressed
it
until
it
became
quiet
and
then
after
wrapping
about
it
the
she
gently
lifted
it
on
her
broad
horns
and
turning
carried
it
steadily
away
toward
the
south
followed
on
either
side
by
her
children
who
kept
crying
out
neh
neh
in
their
delight
the
home
of
this
old
deer
and
her
little
ones
where
all
her
children
had
been
born
for
years
was
south
of
háwikuh
in
the
valley
that
turns
off
among
the
ledges
of
rocks
near
the
little
spring
called
póshaan
there
in
the
shelter
of
a
clump
of
piñon
and
cedar
trees
was
a
soft
and
warm
retreat
winter
and
summer
and
this
was
the
lair
of
the
deer
and
her
young
the
deer
was
no
less
delighted
than
surprised
next
morning
to
find
that
the
infant
had
grown
apace
for
she
had
suckled
it
with
her
own
milk
and
that
before
the
declining
of
the
sun
it
was
already
creeping
about
and
greater
was
her
surprise
and
delight
as
day
succeeded
day
to
find
that
the
child
grew
even
more
swiftly
than
grow
the
children
of
the
deer
behold
on
the
evening
of
the
fourth
day
it
was
running
about
and
playing
with
its
foster
brother
and
sister
nor
was
it
slow
of
foot
even
as
compared
with
those
little
deer
behold
yet
greater
cause
for
wonder
on
the
eighth
day
it
was
a
youth
fair
to
look
upon
looking
upon
itself
and
seeing
that
it
had
no
clothing
and
wondering
why
it
was
not
clothed
like
its
brother
and
sister
in
soft
warm
hair
with
pretty
spots
upon
it
as
time
went
on
this
little
of
the
deer
it
must
always
be
remembered
that
it
was
the
offspring
of
the
himself
in
playing
with
his
brother
and
sister
and
in
his
runnings
about
grew
wondrously
strong
and
even
swifter
of
foot
than
the
deer
themselves
and
learned
the
language
of
the
deer
and
all
their
ways
when
he
had
become
perfected
in
all
that
a
deer
should
know
the
led
him
forth
into
the
wilds
and
made
him
acquainted
with
the
great
herd
to
which
she
belonged
they
were
exceedingly
happy
with
this
addition
to
their
number
much
they
loved
him
and
so
sagacious
was
the
youth
that
he
soon
became
the
leader
of
the
deer
of
the
háwikuh
country
when
these
deer
and
the
antelopes
were
out
on
the
mesas
ranging
to
and
fro
there
at
their
head
ran
the
swift
youth
the
soles
of
his
feet
became
as
hard
as
the
hoofs
of
the
deer
the
skin
of
his
person
strong
and
dark
the
hair
of
his
head
long
and
waving
and
as
soft
as
the
hair
on
the
sides
of
the
deer
themselves
it
chanced
one
morning
late
that
summer
that
the
uncle
of
the
maiden
who
had
cast
away
her
child
went
out
hunting
and
he
took
his
way
southward
past
póshaan
the
lair
of
the
and
her
as
he
traversed
the
borders
of
the
great
mesas
that
lie
beyond
he
saw
a
vast
herd
of
deer
gathered
as
people
gather
in
council
they
were
quiet
and
seemed
to
be
listening
intently
to
some
one
in
their
midst
the
hunter
stole
along
carefully
on
hands
and
knees
twisting
himself
among
the
bushes
until
he
came
nearer
and
what
was
his
wonder
when
he
beheld
in
the
midst
of
the
deer
a
splendid
youth
broad
of
shoulder
tall
and
strong
of
limb
sitting
nude
and
graceful
on
the
ground
and
the
old
deer
and
the
young
seemed
to
be
paying
attention
to
what
he
was
saying
the
hunter
rubbed
his
eyes
and
looked
again
and
again
he
looked
shading
his
eyes
with
his
hands
then
he
elevated
himself
to
peer
yet
more
closely
and
the
sharp
eyes
of
the
youth
discovered
him
with
a
shout
he
lifted
himself
to
his
feet
and
sped
away
like
the
wind
followed
by
the
whole
herd
their
hoofs
thundering
and
soon
they
were
all
out
of
sight
the
hunter
dropped
his
bow
and
stood
there
musing
then
picking
it
up
he
turned
himself
about
and
ran
toward
háwikuh
as
fast
as
he
could
when
he
arrived
he
related
to
the
father
of
the
girl
what
he
had
seen
the
old
priest
summoned
his
hunters
and
warriors
and
bade
the
uncle
repeat
the
story
many
there
were
who
said
you
have
seen
an
apparition
and
of
evil
omen
to
your
family
alas
alas
no
said
he
i
looked
and
again
i
looked
and
yet
again
and
again
and
i
avow
to
you
that
what
i
saw
was
as
plain
and
as
mortal
as
the
deer
convinced
at
last
the
council
decided
to
form
a
grand
hunt
and
word
was
given
from
the
that
on
the
fourth
day
from
that
day
a
hunt
should
be
undertaken
that
the
southern
mesa
should
be
surrounded
and
that
the
people
should
gather
in
from
all
sides
and
encompass
the
herd
there
in
order
that
this
wonderful
youth
should
not
escape
being
seen
or
possibly
captured
now
when
the
deer
had
gone
to
a
safe
distance
they
slackened
their
pace
and
called
to
their
leader
not
to
fear
and
the
old
of
the
youth
for
the
first
time
related
to
him
as
she
had
related
to
them
long
ago
that
he
was
the
child
of
mortals
telling
how
she
had
found
him
the
youth
sat
with
his
head
bowed
thinking
of
these
things
then
he
raised
his
head
proudly
and
said
what
though
i
be
the
child
of
mortals
they
have
not
loved
me
they
have
cast
me
from
their
midst
therefore
will
i
be
faithful
to
thee
but
the
old
said
to
him
hush
my
child
thou
art
but
a
mortal
and
though
thou
might
st
live
on
the
roots
of
the
trees
and
the
bushes
and
plants
that
mature
in
autumn
yet
surely
in
the
winter
time
thou
could
st
not
live
for
my
supply
of
milk
will
be
withholden
and
the
fruits
and
the
nuts
will
all
be
and
the
older
members
of
that
large
herd
gathered
round
and
repeated
what
she
had
been
saying
and
they
said
we
are
aware
that
we
shall
be
hunted
now
as
is
the
invariable
custom
when
our
herd
has
been
discovered
on
the
fourth
day
from
the
day
on
which
we
were
first
seen
amongst
the
people
who
come
there
will
be
no
doubt
those
who
will
seek
you
and
you
must
not
endeavor
to
escape
even
we
ourselves
are
accustomed
to
give
up
our
lives
to
the
brave
hunters
among
this
people
for
many
of
them
are
sacred
of
thought
sacred
of
heart
and
make
due
sacrifices
unto
us
that
our
lives
in
other
form
may
be
spared
a
splendid
deer
rose
from
the
midst
of
the
herd
and
coming
forward
laid
his
cheek
on
the
cheek
of
the
boy
and
said
yet
we
love
you
but
we
must
now
part
from
you
and
in
order
that
you
may
be
like
unto
other
mortals
only
exceeding
them
accompany
me
to
the
land
of
the
souls
of
men
where
sit
in
council
the
gods
of
the
sacred
dance
and
drama
the
gods
of
the
spirit
to
all
this
the
youth
being
convinced
agreed
and
on
that
same
day
the
deer
who
had
spoken
set
forward
the
swift
youth
running
by
his
side
toward
the
lake
of
the
dead
on
and
on
they
sped
and
as
night
was
falling
they
came
to
the
borders
of
that
lake
and
the
lights
were
shining
over
its
middle
and
the
gardens
of
the
sacred
dance
and
the
old
and
the
old
were
walking
on
its
shores
back
and
forth
calling
across
to
each
other
as
the
deer
neared
the
shore
of
the
lake
he
turned
and
said
to
his
companion
step
in
boldly
with
me
ladders
of
rushes
will
rise
to
receive
you
and
down
underneath
the
waters
into
the
great
halls
of
the
dead
and
of
the
sacred
dance
we
will
be
borne
gently
and
then
they
stepped
into
the
lake
brighter
and
lighter
it
grew
great
ladders
of
rushes
and
flags
lifted
themselves
from
the
water
and
upon
them
the
deer
and
his
companion
were
borne
downward
into
halls
of
splendor
lighted
by
many
lights
and
fires
and
in
the
largest
chamber
the
gods
were
sitting
in
council
silently
páutiwa
the
of
the
sacred
drama
shúlawitsi
the
god
of
fire
with
his
torch
of
flame
and
many
others
were
there
and
when
the
strangers
arrived
they
greeted
and
were
greeted
and
were
given
a
place
in
the
light
of
the
central
fire
and
in
through
the
doors
of
the
west
and
the
north
and
the
east
and
the
south
filed
long
rows
of
sacred
dancers
those
who
had
passed
through
the
lake
of
the
dead
clad
in
cotton
mantles
white
as
the
daylight
finely
embroidered
decked
with
many
a
treasure
shell
and
turquoise
stone
these
performed
their
sacred
rites
to
the
delight
of
the
gods
and
the
wonder
of
the
deer
and
his
and
when
the
dancers
had
retired
páutiwa
the
of
the
sacred
dance
arose
and
said
what
would
st
thou
though
he
knew
full
well
beforehand
what
would
st
thou
oh
deer
of
the
forest
mesas
with
thy
companion
thy
for
not
thinking
of
nothing
would
one
visit
the
home
of
the
then
the
deer
lifted
his
head
and
told
his
story
it
is
well
said
the
gods
appear
my
faithful
one
said
páutiwa
to
shúlawitsi
and
shúlawitsi
appeared
and
waved
his
flame
around
the
youth
so
that
he
became
convinced
of
his
mortal
origin
and
of
his
dependence
upon
food
prepared
by
fire
then
the
gods
who
speak
the
speech
of
men
gathered
around
and
breathed
upon
the
youth
and
touched
to
his
lips
moisture
from
their
own
mouths
and
touched
the
portals
of
his
ears
with
oil
from
their
own
ears
and
thus
was
the
youth
made
acquainted
with
both
the
speech
and
the
understanding
of
the
speech
of
mortal
man
then
the
gods
called
out
and
there
were
brought
before
them
fine
garments
of
white
cotton
embroidered
in
many
colors
rare
necklaces
of
sacred
shell
with
many
turquoises
and
stones
and
shells
strung
in
their
midst
and
all
that
the
most
beautifully
clad
of
our
ancients
could
have
glorified
their
appearance
with
such
things
they
brought
forth
and
making
them
into
a
bundle
laid
them
at
the
feet
of
the
youth
then
they
said
oh
youth
oh
brother
and
father
since
thou
art
the
child
of
the
sun
who
is
the
father
of
us
all
go
forth
with
thy
to
thy
last
with
him
and
with
his
people
and
when
on
the
day
after
the
morrow
hunters
shall
gather
from
around
thy
country
some
of
ye
oh
deer
said
he
turning
to
the
deer
yield
thyselves
up
that
ye
may
die
as
must
thy
kind
ever
continue
to
die
for
the
sake
of
this
thy
i
will
lead
them
simply
replied
the
deer
and
páutiwa
continued
here
full
soon
wilt
thou
be
gathered
in
our
midst
or
with
the
winds
and
the
mists
of
the
air
at
wilt
sport
go
ye
forth
then
carrying
this
bundle
and
as
ye
best
know
how
prepare
this
our
father
and
child
for
his
reception
among
men
and
o
son
and
father
continued
the
turning
to
the
youth
fear
not
happy
wilt
thou
be
in
the
days
to
come
and
treasured
among
men
hence
thy
birth
return
with
the
deer
and
do
as
thou
art
told
to
do
thy
uncle
leading
his
will
be
foremost
in
the
hunt
he
will
pursue
thee
and
thy
lead
him
far
away
and
when
thou
hast
so
led
him
cease
running
and
turn
and
wait
and
peacefully
go
home
whither
he
guides
the
sounds
of
the
sacred
dance
came
in
from
the
outer
apartments
and
the
youth
and
the
deer
taking
their
bundle
departed
more
quickly
than
they
had
come
they
sped
away
and
on
the
morning
when
the
hunters
of
háwikuh
were
setting
forth
the
deer
gathered
themselves
in
a
vast
herd
on
the
southern
mesa
and
they
circled
about
the
youth
and
instructed
him
how
to
unloose
the
bundle
he
had
brought
then
closer
and
closer
came
the
deer
to
the
youth
and
bade
him
stand
in
his
nakedness
and
they
ran
swiftly
about
him
breathing
fierce
moist
breaths
until
hot
steam
enveloped
him
and
bathed
him
from
head
to
foot
so
that
he
was
purified
and
his
skin
was
softened
and
his
hair
hung
down
in
a
smooth
yet
waving
mass
at
the
back
of
his
head
then
the
youth
put
on
the
costume
one
article
after
another
he
having
seen
them
worn
by
the
gods
of
the
sacred
dance
and
by
the
dancers
and
into
his
hair
at
the
back
under
the
band
which
he
placed
round
his
temples
he
thrust
the
glowing
feathers
of
the
macaw
which
had
been
given
him
then
seeing
that
there
was
still
one
article
left
a
little
string
of
conical
shells
he
asked
what
that
was
for
and
the
deer
told
him
to
tie
it
about
his
knee
the
deer
gathered
around
him
once
more
and
the
old
chief
said
who
among
ye
are
willing
to
die
and
as
if
it
were
a
festive
occasion
to
which
they
were
going
many
a
fine
deer
bounded
forth
striving
for
the
place
of
those
who
were
to
die
until
a
large
number
were
gathered
fearless
and
ready
then
the
deer
began
to
move
soon
there
was
an
alarm
in
the
north
and
the
west
and
the
south
and
the
east
there
was
cause
for
alarm
and
the
deer
began
to
scatter
and
then
to
assemble
and
scatter
again
at
last
the
hunters
with
drawn
bows
came
running
in
and
soon
their
arrows
were
flying
in
the
midst
of
those
who
were
devoted
and
deer
after
deer
fell
pierced
to
the
heart
or
other
vital
part
at
last
but
few
were
left
amongst
them
the
kind
old
and
her
two
children
and
taking
the
lead
the
glorious
youth
although
encumbered
by
his
new
dress
sped
forth
with
them
they
ran
and
ran
the
fleetest
of
the
tribe
of
háwikuh
pursuing
them
but
all
save
the
uncle
and
his
brave
sons
were
soon
left
far
behind
the
youth
s
was
soon
slain
and
the
youth
growing
angry
turned
about
then
bethinking
himself
of
the
words
of
the
gods
he
sped
away
again
so
his
too
was
killed
but
he
kept
on
his
old
mother
alone
running
behind
him
at
last
the
uncle
and
his
sons
overtook
the
old
mother
and
they
merely
caught
her
and
turned
her
away
saying
faithful
to
the
last
she
has
been
to
this
then
they
renewed
the
chase
for
the
youth
and
he
at
last
pretending
weariness
faced
about
and
stood
like
a
stag
at
bay
as
soon
as
they
approached
he
dropped
his
arms
and
lowered
his
head
then
he
said
oh
my
uncle
for
the
gods
had
told
who
would
find
him
oh
my
uncle
what
wouldst
thou
thou
hast
killed
my
brothers
and
sisters
what
wouldst
thou
with
me
the
old
man
stopped
and
gazed
at
the
youth
in
wonder
and
admiration
of
his
fine
appearance
and
beautiful
apparel
then
he
said
why
dost
thou
call
me
uncle
because
verily
replied
the
youth
thou
art
my
uncle
and
thy
niece
my
gave
birth
to
me
and
cast
me
away
upon
a
and
then
my
noble
deer
found
me
and
nourished
me
and
cherished
the
uncle
and
his
sons
gazed
still
with
wonder
then
they
thought
they
saw
in
the
youth
s
clear
eyes
and
his
soft
oval
face
a
likeness
to
the
mother
and
they
said
verily
this
which
he
says
is
then
they
turned
about
and
took
him
by
the
hands
gently
and
led
him
toward
háwikuh
while
one
of
them
sped
forward
to
test
the
truth
of
his
utterances
when
the
messenger
arrived
at
háwikuh
he
took
his
way
straight
to
the
house
of
the
priest
and
told
him
what
he
had
heard
the
priest
in
anger
summoned
the
maiden
oh
my
child
said
he
hast
thou
done
this
thing
which
we
are
told
thou
hast
done
and
he
related
what
he
had
been
told
nay
no
such
thing
have
i
done
said
she
yea
but
thou
hast
oh
unnatural
mother
and
who
was
the
father
demanded
the
old
priest
with
great
severity
then
the
maiden
thinking
of
her
bowed
her
head
in
her
lap
and
rocked
herself
to
and
fro
and
cried
sorely
and
then
she
said
yea
it
is
true
so
true
that
i
feared
thy
wrath
oh
my
father
i
feared
thy
shame
oh
my
mother
and
what
could
i
do
then
she
told
of
her
lover
the
sun
with
tears
she
told
it
and
she
cried
out
bring
back
my
child
that
i
may
nurse
him
and
love
but
him
alone
and
see
him
the
father
of
children
by
this
time
the
hunters
arrived
some
bringing
game
but
others
bringing
in
their
midst
this
wondrous
youth
on
whom
each
man
and
maiden
in
háwikuh
gazed
with
delight
and
admiration
they
took
him
to
the
home
of
his
and
as
though
he
knew
the
way
he
entered
the
apartment
of
his
mother
and
she
rising
and
opening
wide
her
arms
threw
herself
on
his
breast
and
cried
and
cried
and
he
laid
his
hand
on
her
head
and
said
oh
mother
weep
not
for
i
have
come
to
thee
and
i
will
cherish
so
was
the
of
the
deer
restored
to
his
mother
and
his
people
wondrously
wise
in
the
ways
of
the
deer
and
their
language
was
he
so
much
so
that
seeing
them
he
understood
them
this
youth
made
little
ado
of
hunting
for
he
knew
that
he
could
pay
those
rites
and
attentions
to
the
deer
that
were
most
acceptable
and
made
them
glad
of
death
at
the
hand
of
the
hunter
and
ere
long
so
great
was
his
knowledge
and
success
and
his
preciousness
in
the
eyes
of
the
master
of
life
that
by
his
will
and
his
arm
alone
the
tribe
of
háwikuh
was
fed
and
was
clad
in
buckskins
a
rare
and
beautiful
maiden
he
married
and
most
happy
was
he
with
her
it
was
his
custom
to
go
forth
early
in
the
morning
when
the
deer
came
down
to
drink
or
stretch
themselves
and
walk
abroad
and
crop
the
grass
and
taking
his
bow
and
quiver
of
arrows
he
would
go
to
a
distant
mesa
and
calling
the
deer
around
him
and
following
them
as
swiftly
as
they
ran
he
would
strike
them
down
in
great
numbers
and
returning
say
to
his
people
go
and
bring
in
my
game
giving
me
only
parts
of
what
i
have
slain
and
taking
the
rest
so
you
can
readily
see
how
he
and
his
people
became
the
greatest
people
of
háwikuh
nor
is
it
marvellous
that
the
sorcerers
of
that
tribe
should
have
grown
envious
of
his
prosperity
and
sought
to
diminish
it
in
many
ways
wherein
they
failed
at
last
one
night
the
master
of
sorcerers
in
secret
places
raised
his
voice
and
cried
and
round
about
him
presently
gathered
all
the
sorcerers
of
the
place
and
they
entered
into
a
deep
cavern
large
and
lighted
by
green
glowing
fires
and
there
staring
at
each
other
they
devised
means
to
destroy
this
splendid
youth
the
child
of
the
sun
one
of
their
number
stood
forth
and
said
i
will
destroy
him
in
his
own
vocation
he
is
a
hunter
and
the
coyote
loves
well
to
follow
the
his
words
were
received
with
acclamation
and
the
youth
who
had
offered
himself
sped
forth
in
the
night
to
prepare
by
incantation
and
with
his
infernal
appliances
a
disguise
for
himself
on
the
next
morning
when
the
youth
went
forth
to
hunt
an
old
coyote
sneaked
behind
him
after
he
reached
the
mesas
and
following
stealthily
waited
his
throwing
down
of
the
deer
and
when
the
youth
had
called
and
killed
a
number
of
deer
and
sat
down
to
rest
on
a
fallen
tree
the
coyote
sneaked
into
sight
the
youth
looking
at
him
merely
thought
he
seeks
the
blood
of
my
slain
deer
and
he
went
on
with
his
prayers
and
sacrifices
to
the
dead
of
the
deer
but
soon
stiffening
his
limbs
the
coyote
swiftly
scudded
across
the
open
and
with
a
puff
from
his
mouth
and
nostrils
like
a
sneeze
toward
the
youth
threw
himself
against
him
and
arose
a
man
the
same
man
who
had
offered
his
services
in
the
council
of
the
wizards
while
the
poor
youth
falling
over
ran
away
a
human
being
still
in
heart
and
mind
but
in
form
a
coyote
off
to
the
southward
he
wandered
his
tail
dragging
in
the
dust
and
growing
hungry
he
had
naught
to
eat
and
cold
on
the
sides
of
the
mesas
he
passed
the
night
and
on
the
following
morning
wandered
still
until
at
last
very
hungry
he
was
fain
even
to
nip
the
blades
of
grass
and
eat
the
berries
of
the
juniper
thus
he
became
ill
and
worn
and
one
night
as
he
was
seeking
a
warm
place
to
lay
him
down
and
die
he
saw
a
little
red
light
glowing
from
the
top
of
a
hillock
toward
this
light
he
took
his
way
and
when
he
came
near
he
saw
that
it
was
shining
up
through
the
of
someone
s
house
he
peered
over
the
edge
and
saw
an
old
badger
with
his
grizzly
wife
sitting
before
a
fire
not
in
the
form
of
a
badger
but
in
the
form
of
a
little
man
his
hanging
beside
him
then
the
youth
said
to
himself
i
will
cast
myself
down
into
their
house
thus
showing
them
my
miserable
and
as
he
tried
to
step
down
the
ladder
he
fell
on
the
floor
before
them
the
badgers
were
disgusted
they
grabbed
the
coyote
and
hauling
him
up
the
ladder
threw
him
into
the
plain
where
he
fell
far
away
and
swooned
from
loss
of
breath
when
he
recovered
his
thoughts
he
again
turned
toward
the
glowing
and
crawling
feebly
back
threw
himself
down
into
the
room
again
again
he
was
thrown
out
but
this
time
the
badger
said
it
is
marvellously
strange
that
this
coyote
the
miserable
fellow
should
insist
on
coming
back
and
coming
i
have
heard
said
the
little
old
that
our
glorious
beloved
youth
of
háwikuh
was
changed
some
time
ago
into
a
coyote
it
may
be
he
let
us
see
when
he
comes
again
if
it
be
he
for
the
love
of
mercy
let
us
see
ere
long
the
youth
again
tried
to
clamber
down
the
ladder
and
fell
with
a
thud
on
the
floor
before
them
a
long
time
he
lay
there
senseless
but
at
last
opened
his
eyes
and
looked
about
the
badgers
eagerly
asked
if
he
were
the
same
who
had
been
changed
into
a
coyote
or
condemned
to
inhabit
the
form
of
one
the
youth
could
only
move
his
head
in
acquiescence
then
the
badgers
hastily
gathered
an
emetic
and
set
it
to
boil
and
when
ready
they
poured
the
fluid
down
the
throat
of
the
seeming
coyote
and
tenderly
held
him
and
pitied
him
then
they
laid
him
before
the
fire
to
warm
him
then
the
old
badger
looking
about
in
some
of
his
burrows
found
a
sacred
rock
crystal
and
heating
it
to
glowing
heat
in
the
fire
he
seared
the
palms
of
the
youth
s
hands
the
soles
of
his
feet
and
the
crown
of
his
head
repeating
incantations
as
he
performed
this
last
operation
whereupon
the
skin
burst
and
fell
off
and
the
youth
haggard
and
lean
lay
before
them
they
nourished
him
as
best
they
could
and
when
well
recovered
sent
him
home
to
join
his
people
again
and
render
them
happy
clad
in
his
own
fine
garments
happy
of
countenance
and
handsome
as
before
and
according
to
his
regular
custom
bearing
a
deer
on
his
back
returned
the
youth
to
his
people
and
there
he
lived
most
happily
as
i
have
said
this
was
in
the
days
of
the
ancients
and
it
is
because
this
youth
lived
so
long
with
the
deer
and
became
acquainted
with
their
every
way
and
their
every
word
and
taught
all
that
he
knew
to
his
children
and
to
others
whom
he
took
into
his
friendship
that
we
have
today
a
class
of
men
the
sacred
hunters
of
our
tribe
who
surpassingly
understand
the
ways
and
the
language
of
the
deer
thus
shortens
my
story
illustration
carvings
the
boy
hunter
who
never
sacrificed
to
the
deer
he
had
slain
or
the
origin
of
the
society
of
rattlesnakes
in
very
ancient
times
there
lived
at
below
the
zuñi
mountains
an
old
or
who
had
a
young
son
named
héasailuhtiwa
famed
throughout
the
land
of
the
zuñis
for
his
success
in
hunting
the
native
name
of
the
zuñi
town
of
las
nutrias
when
very
young
this
lad
had
said
to
his
parents
my
old
ones
let
me
go
away
from
the
home
of
my
fathers
and
dwell
by
why
do
you
a
young
boy
wish
to
go
and
dwell
by
yourself
my
son
know
you
not
that
you
would
fare
but
badly
for
you
are
careless
and
forgetful
no
no
remain
with
us
that
we
may
care
for
but
the
boy
answered
why
should
i
fare
badly
can
i
not
hunt
my
own
game
and
roast
the
meat
over
the
fire
it
is
because
you
never
care
to
have
me
go
forth
alone
that
i
wish
to
live
by
myself
for
i
long
to
travel
far
and
hunt
deer
in
the
mountains
of
many
countries
yet
whenever
i
start
forth
you
call
me
back
and
it
is
painful
to
my
longing
thoughts
thus
to
be
held
back
when
i
would
go
it
was
not
until
the
lad
had
spoken
thus
again
and
again
and
once
more
that
the
parents
sadly
yielded
to
his
wish
they
insisted
however
much
to
the
boy
s
displeasure
that
his
younger
sister
waíasialuhtitsa
should
go
with
him
only
to
look
after
his
house
and
to
remind
him
here
and
there
at
times
of
his
forgetfulness
so
the
brother
and
sister
chose
the
lofty
rooms
of
a
high
house
in
the
upper
part
of
the
pueblo
and
lived
there
the
boy
each
day
went
out
hunting
and
failed
not
each
time
to
bring
in
slain
animals
while
the
sister
cooked
for
him
and
looked
after
the
house
yet
although
the
boy
was
a
great
hunter
he
never
sacrificed
to
the
deer
he
had
slain
nor
to
the
gods
of
prey
who
delight
in
aiding
the
hunter
who
renews
them
for
the
lad
was
forgetful
and
careless
of
all
things
one
day
he
went
forth
over
the
mountain
toward
the
north
until
he
came
to
the
waters
of
the
bear
there
he
started
up
a
huge
buck
and
finding
the
trail
followed
it
far
toward
the
northward
yet
although
swift
of
foot
the
youth
could
not
overtake
the
running
deer
and
thus
it
happened
that
he
went
on
and
on
past
mesas
valleys
and
mountains
until
he
came
to
the
brink
of
a
great
river
which
flows
westwardly
from
the
north
on
the
banks
of
this
great
river
grew
forests
of
cottonwood
and
into
the
thickets
of
these
forests
led
the
trail
straight
toward
the
river
bank
just
as
the
young
man
was
about
to
follow
the
track
to
the
bank
he
thought
he
saw
under
a
large
tree
in
the
midst
of
the
thickets
the
form
of
the
deer
so
bending
very
low
he
ran
around
close
to
the
bank
and
came
up
between
the
river
and
the
thicket
aínshik
yanakwin
or
bear
spring
where
fort
wingate
now
stands
probably
green
river
or
some
important
tributary
of
the
colorado
grande
as
he
guardedly
approached
the
tree
his
eyes
now
following
the
track
now
glancing
up
he
discovered
a
richly
dressed
handsome
young
man
who
called
out
to
him
how
art
thou
these
days
and
whither
art
thou
going
the
young
man
straightened
up
and
quickly
drawing
his
breath
replied
i
am
hunting
a
deer
whose
tracks
i
have
followed
all
the
way
from
the
waters
of
the
indeed
exclaimed
the
stranger
and
where
has
thy
deer
gone
i
know
not
replied
the
youth
for
here
are
his
then
he
observed
that
they
led
to
the
place
where
the
stranger
was
sitting
and
the
latter
at
the
same
time
remarked
i
am
the
deer
and
it
was
as
i
would
have
it
that
i
enticed
thee
exclaimed
the
young
man
aye
continued
the
stranger
alas
alas
thou
forgetful
one
thou
hast
day
after
day
chased
my
children
over
the
plains
and
slain
them
thou
hast
made
thyself
happy
of
their
flesh
and
of
their
flesh
added
unto
thine
own
meat
and
that
of
thy
kindred
but
alas
thou
hast
been
forgetful
and
careless
and
not
once
hast
thou
given
unto
their
souls
the
comfort
of
that
which
they
yearn
for
and
need
yet
hast
thou
had
good
fortune
in
the
chase
at
last
the
has
listened
to
the
supplications
of
my
children
and
commanded
that
i
bring
thee
here
and
here
have
i
brought
thee
listen
the
commands
that
thou
shalt
visit
him
in
his
house
at
the
western
end
of
the
world
and
these
are
his
indeed
well
i
suppose
it
must
be
and
it
is
well
exclaimed
the
young
man
and
continued
the
thou
must
hasten
home
and
call
thy
father
tell
him
to
summon
his
priest
of
the
bow
or
warrior
and
command
him
that
he
shall
instruct
his
children
to
repair
to
the
rooms
of
sacred
things
and
prepare
plumed
for
the
the
and
the
great
ocean
and
red
plumes
of
sacrifice
for
the
beings
of
prey
that
fully
they
must
prepare
everything
for
thou
their
child
and
father
shalt
visit
the
home
of
the
and
in
payment
for
thy
forgetfulness
and
carelessness
shalt
render
him
and
the
and
the
beings
of
the
great
ocean
plumes
of
sacrifice
hasten
home
and
tell
thy
father
these
things
then
tell
thy
sister
to
prepare
sweetened
meal
of
parched
corn
to
serve
as
the
food
of
thy
journey
and
pollen
of
the
flowers
of
corn
and
ask
thy
mother
to
prepare
great
quantities
of
new
cotton
and
making
all
these
things
into
bundles
thou
must
summon
some
of
thy
relatives
and
come
to
this
tree
on
the
fourth
day
from
this
day
make
haste
for
thou
art
swift
of
foot
and
tell
all
these
things
to
thy
father
he
will
understand
thee
for
is
he
not
a
hast
thou
knives
of
flint
yes
said
the
young
man
my
father
has
select
from
them
two
said
the
a
large
one
and
a
smaller
one
and
when
thou
hast
returned
to
this
place
cut
down
with
the
larger
knife
yonder
great
tree
and
with
the
smaller
knife
hollow
it
out
leave
the
large
end
entire
and
for
the
smaller
end
thou
must
make
a
round
door
and
around
the
inside
of
the
smaller
end
cut
a
notch
that
shall
be
like
a
terrace
toward
the
outside
but
shall
slope
from
within
that
thou
mayest
close
it
from
the
inside
with
the
round
door
then
pad
the
inside
with
cotton
and
make
in
the
bottom
a
padding
thicker
than
the
rest
but
leave
space
that
thou
mayest
lie
thy
length
or
sit
up
and
eat
and
in
the
top
cut
a
hole
larger
inside
than
out
that
thou
mayest
close
it
from
the
inside
with
a
plug
of
wood
then
when
thou
hast
placed
the
sweetened
meal
of
parched
corn
inside
and
the
plumed
and
the
sacred
pollen
of
then
enter
thyself
and
close
the
door
in
the
end
and
the
hole
in
the
top
that
thy
people
may
roll
thee
into
the
river
thou
wilt
meet
strange
beings
on
thy
way
choose
from
amongst
them
whom
thou
shalt
have
as
a
companion
and
proceed
as
thy
companion
shall
direct
to
the
great
mountain
where
the
sun
enters
haste
and
tell
thy
father
these
and
ere
the
youth
could
say
be
it
well
and
i
will
the
had
vanished
and
he
lifted
up
his
face
and
started
swiftly
for
the
home
of
his
fathers
at
sunset
the
sister
looked
forth
from
her
high
but
nowhere
could
she
see
her
brother
coming
she
turned
at
last
to
enter
thinking
and
saying
to
her
breast
alas
what
did
we
not
think
and
guess
of
his
but
just
as
the
country
was
growing
dim
in
the
darkness
the
young
man
ran
breathlessly
in
and
greeting
his
sister
sat
down
in
the
doorway
the
sister
wondered
that
he
had
no
deer
or
other
game
but
placed
a
meal
before
him
and
when
he
had
done
herself
ate
but
the
young
man
remained
silent
until
she
had
finished
then
he
said
younger
sister
i
am
weary
and
would
sit
here
do
you
go
and
call
father
for
i
would
speak
to
him
of
many
so
the
sister
cleared
away
the
food
and
ran
to
summon
the
father
soon
she
returned
with
the
old
man
who
sighing
hua
from
the
effort
of
climbing
greeted
his
son
and
sat
down
looking
all
about
the
room
for
the
fresh
but
seeing
none
he
asked
what
and
wherefore
hast
thou
summoned
me
my
son
it
is
this
replied
the
son
and
he
related
all
that
had
been
told
him
by
the
describing
the
magnificent
dress
the
turquoise
and
shell
earrings
necklaces
and
wristlets
of
the
handsome
stranger
certainly
replied
the
father
it
is
well
for
as
the
hath
directed
the
thus
must
it
be
then
he
forthwith
went
away
and
commanded
his
priest
of
the
bow
who
mounting
to
the
topmost
house
directed
the
elders
and
priests
of
the
tribe
saying
ye
our
children
listen
ye
i
will
this
day
inform
our
child
our
father
he
of
the
strong
hand
he
who
so
hunts
the
deer
goes
unto
the
sunset
world

gather
at
the
sacred
houses
bring
thy
twines
and
feathers
and
prepare

him
for
the
for
the
for
the
great
ocean
for
the
plumes
and
treasures
hasten
hasten
ye
our
children
in
the
morning
so
the
people
gathered
in
the
and
sacred
houses
next
morning
and
began
to
make
while
the
sister
of
the
young
man
and
her
relatives
made
sweet
parched
and
gathered
pollen
toward
evening
all
was
completed
the
young
man
summoned
his
relatives
and
chose
his
four
uncles
to
accompany
him
then
he
spread
enough
out
to
cover
the
floor
and
gathering
it
up
made
it
into
a
small
bundle
the
sweet
meal
filled
a
large
sack
of
buckskin
and
he
took
also
a
little
sack
of
sacred
red
paint
and
the
black
warrior
paint
with
little
shining
particles
in
it
then
he
bade
farewell
to
his
lamenting
people
and
rested
for
the
evening
journey
next
morning
escorted
by
priests
the
young
man
arrayed
in
garments
of
embroidered
white
cotton
and
carrying
his
plumes
in
his
arms
started
out
of
the
town
and
accompanied
only
by
his
four
uncles
set
out
over
the
mountains
on
the
third
day
they
reached
the
forest
on
the
bank
of
the
great
river
and
encamped
then
the
young
man
left
the
camp
of
his
uncles
and
went
alone
into
the
forest
and
choosing
the
greatest
tree
he
could
find
hacked
midway
through
it
with
his
great
flint
knife
the
next
day
he
cut
the
other
half
and
felled
it
when
he
found
it
partly
hollow
so
with
his
little
knife
he
began
to
cut
it
as
he
had
been
directed
and
made
the
round
door
for
it
and
the
hole
through
the
top
with
his
bundle
of
cotton
he
padded
it
everywhere
inside
until
it
was
thickly
coated
and
soft
and
he
made
a
bed
on
the
bottom
as
thick
as
himself
when
all
was
ready
and
he
had
placed
his
food
and
plumes
inside
he
called
his
uncles
and
showed
them
the
hollow
log
in
this
said
he
i
am
to
journey
to
the
western
home
of
our
when
i
have
entered
and
closed
the
round
door
tightly
and
put
the
plug
into
the
upper
hole
securely
do
ye
never
thinking
of
me
roll
the
log
over
and
over
to
the
high
brink
of
the
river
and
never
regarding
consequences
push
it
into
the
then
it
was
that
the
uncles
all
lamented
and
tried
to
dissuade
him
but
he
persisted
and
they
bade
him
go
as
forever
for
said
they
could
one
think
of
journeying
even
to
the
end
of
the
earth
and
across
the
waters
that
embrace
the
world
without
perishing
then
hastily
embracing
each
of
them
the
young
man
entered
his
log
and
securely
fastening
the
door
from
the
inside
and
the
plug
called
out
they
heard
but
faintly
which
means
all
is
sorrowfully
and
gently
they
rolled
the
log
over
and
over
to
the
high
river
bank
and
hesitating
a
moment
pushed
it
off
with
anxious
eyes
and
closed
mouths
into
the
river
eagerly
they
watched
it
as
it
tumbled
and
down
into
the
water
with
a
great
splash
and
disappeared
under
the
waves
which
rolled
one
after
another
across
to
the
opposite
banks
of
the
river
but
for
a
long
time
they
saw
nothing
of
it
after
a
while
far
off
speeding
on
toward
the
western
waters
of
the
world
they
saw
the
log
rocking
along
on
the
rushing
waters
until
it
passed
out
of
sight
and
they
sadly
turned
toward
their
homes
under
the
mountains
of
the
south
when
the
log
had
ceased
rocking
and
plunging
the
young
man
cautiously
drew
out
the
plug
and
finding
that
no
water
flowed
in
peered
out
a
ray
of
sunlight
slanted
in
and
by
that
he
knew
it
was
not
yet
midday
and
he
could
see
a
round
piece
of
sky
and
clouds
through
the
hole
the
ray
of
sunlight
came
straight
down
and
then
after
a
while
slanted
the
other
way
and
finally
toward
evening
it
ceased
to
shine
in
and
then
the
youth
took
out
some
of
his
meal
and
ate
his
supper
when
after
a
while
he
could
see
the
stars
and
later
the
hanging
lines
the
of
orion
he
knew
it
was
time
to
rest
so
he
lay
down
to
sleep
thus
day
after
day
he
travelled
until
he
knew
he
was
out
on
the
great
waters
of
the
world
for
no
longer
did
his
log
strike
against
anything
or
whirl
around
nor
could
he
see
through
the
chink
leaves
of
overhanging
trees
nor
rocks
and
banks
of
earth
on
the
tenth
morning
when
he
looked
up
through
the
hole
he
saw
that
the
clouds
did
not
move
and
wondering
at
this
kicked
at
his
log
but
it
would
not
move
then
he
peered
out
as
far
as
he
could
and
saw
rocks
and
trees
when
he
tried
to
rock
his
log
it
remained
firm
so
he
determined
to
open
the
door
at
the
end
now
in
reality
his
log
had
been
cast
high
up
on
the
shore
of
a
great
mountain
that
rose
out
of
the
waters
and
this
mountain
was
the
home
of
the
rattlesnakes
a
rattlesnake
maiden
was
roaming
along
the
shore
just
as
the
young
man
was
about
to
open
the
door
of
his
log
she
espied
the
curious
vessel
and
said
to
herself
in
thought
what
may
this
be
ah
yes
and
who
ah
yes
the
mortal
who
was
to
come
it
must
be
he
whereupon
she
hastened
to
the
shore
and
tapped
on
the
log
art
thou
come
she
asked
aye
replied
the
youth
who
may
you
be
and
where
am
i
you
are
landed
on
the
island
of
the
rattlesnakes
and
i
am
one
of
them
the
other
side
of
the
mountain
here
is
where
our
village
is
come
out
and
go
with
me
for
my
old
ones
have
expected
you
is
it
dry
surely
asked
the
young
man
why
yes
here
you
are
high
above
the
thereupon
the
young
man
opened
from
the
inside
his
door
and
peered
out
surely
enough
there
he
was
high
among
the
rocks
and
sands
then
he
looked
at
the
rattlesnake
maiden
and
scarcely
believed
she
was
what
she
called
herself
for
she
was
a
most
beautiful
young
woman
and
like
a
daughter
of
men
yet
around
her
waist
she
was
dressed
in
cotton
mantles
was
girt
a
which
was
open
at
the
breast
and
on
the
crown
of
the
head
come
with
me
said
the
maiden
and
she
led
the
way
over
the
mountain
and
across
to
a
deep
valley
where
terrible
serpents
writhed
and
gleamed
in
the
sunlight
so
thickly
that
they
seemed
with
their
hissing
and
rattling
like
a
dry
mat
shaken
by
the
wind
the
youth
drew
back
in
horror
but
the
maiden
said
fear
not
they
will
neither
harm
you
nor
frighten
you
more
for
they
are
my
whereupon
she
commanded
them
to
fall
back
and
make
a
pathway
for
the
young
man
and
herself
and
they
tamely
obeyed
her
commands
through
the
opening
thus
made
they
passed
down
to
a
cavern
on
entering
which
they
found
a
great
room
there
were
great
numbers
of
rattlesnake
people
old
and
young
gathered
in
council
for
they
knew
of
the
coming
of
the
young
man
around
the
walls
of
their
houses
were
many
pegs
and
racks
with
serpent
skins
hanging
on
them
skins
like
the
one
the
young
girl
wore
as
a
girdle
the
elders
arose
and
greeted
the
youth
saying
our
child
and
our
father
comest
thou
comest
thou
happily
these
many
days
aye
happily
replied
the
youth
and
after
a
feast
of
strange
food
had
been
placed
before
the
young
man
and
he
had
eaten
a
little
the
elders
said
to
him
knowest
thou
whither
thou
goest
that
the
way
is
long
and
fearful
and
to
mortals
unknown
and
that
it
will
be
but
to
meet
with
poverty
that
thou
journeyest
alone
therefore
have
we
assembled
to
await
thy
coming
and
in
order
that
thou
shouldst
journey
preciously
we
have
decided
to
ask
thee
to
choose
from
amongst
us
whom
thou
shalt
have
for
a
it
is
well
my
fathers
said
the
young
man
and
casting
his
eyes
about
the
council
to
find
which
face
should
be
kindest
to
him
he
chose
the
maiden
and
said
let
it
be
this
one
for
she
found
me
and
loved
me
in
that
she
gently
and
without
fear
brought
me
into
your
and
the
girl
said
it
is
well
and
i
will
instantly
the
grave
and
dignified
elders
the
youths
and
maidens
the
matrons
all
reached
up
for
their
serpent
skins
and
passing
them
over
their
persons
lo
in
the
time
of
the
telling
of
it
the
whole
place
was
filled
with
writhing
and
hissing
serpents
and
the
din
of
their
rattles
in
horror
the
young
man
stood
against
the
wall
like
a
hollow
stalk
and
the
serpent
maiden
going
to
each
of
the
members
of
the
council
extracted
from
each
a
single
fang
which
she
wrapped
together
in
a
piece
of
fabric
until
she
had
a
great
bundle
then
she
passed
her
hand
over
her
person
and
lo
she
became
a
beautiful
human
maiden
again
holding
in
her
hand
a
rattlesnake
skin
then
taking
up
the
bundle
of
fangs
she
said
to
the
young
man
come
for
i
know
the
way
and
will
guide
you
and
the
young
man
followed
her
to
the
shore
where
his
log
lay
now
said
she
wait
while
i
fix
this
log
anew
that
it
may
be
well
and
she
bored
many
little
holes
all
over
the
log
and
into
these
holes
she
inserted
the
crooked
fangs
so
that
they
all
stood
slanting
toward
the
rear
like
the
spines
on
the
back
of
a
porcupine
when
she
had
done
this
she
said
first
i
will
enter
for
there
may
not
be
room
for
two
and
in
order
that
i
may
make
myself
like
the
space
i
enter
i
will
lay
on
my
dress
again
do
you
when
i
have
entered
enter
also
and
with
your
feet
kick
the
log
down
to
the
shore
waters
when
you
must
quickly
close
the
door
and
the
waters
will
take
us
abroad
upon
in
an
instant
she
had
passed
into
her
serpent
form
again
and
crawled
into
the
log
the
young
man
did
as
he
was
bidden
and
as
he
closed
the
door
a
wave
bore
them
gently
out
upon
the
waters
then
as
the
young
man
turned
to
look
upon
his
companion
coiled
so
near
him
he
drew
back
in
horror
why
do
you
fear
asked
the
rattlesnake
i
know
not
but
i
fear
you
perhaps
though
you
speak
gently
you
will
when
i
sleep
bite
me
and
devour
my
flesh
and
it
is
with
thoughts
of
this
that
i
have
ah
no
replied
the
maiden
but
that
you
may
not
fear
i
will
change
and
so
saying
she
took
off
her
skin
and
opening
the
upper
part
of
the
door
hung
the
skin
on
the
fangs
outside
finally
toward
the
youth
prepared
his
meal
food
and
placing
some
before
the
maiden
asked
her
to
eat
ah
no
alas
i
know
not
the
food
of
mortals
have
you
not
with
you
the
yellow
dust
of
the
aye
that
i
have
said
the
young
man
and
producing
a
bag
opened
it
and
asked
the
girl
how
shall
i
feed
it
to
you
scatter
it
upon
the
cotton
and
by
my
knowledge
i
will
gather
then
the
young
man
scattered
a
great
quantity
on
the
cotton
wondering
how
the
girl
would
gather
it
up
but
the
maiden
opened
the
door
and
taking
down
the
skin
changed
herself
to
a
serpent
and
passing
to
and
fro
over
the
pollen
received
it
all
within
her
scales
then
she
resumed
her
human
form
again
and
hung
the
skin
up
as
before
thus
they
floated
until
they
came
to
the
great
forks
of
the
mighty
waters
of
the
world
and
their
floating
log
was
guided
into
the
southern
branch
and
on
they
floated
toward
the
westward
for
four
months
from
the
time
when
the
uncles
had
thrown
him
into
the
river
one
day
the
maiden
said
to
the
youth
we
are
nearing
our
journey
s
end
and
as
i
know
the
way
i
will
guide
you
hold
yourself
hard
and
ready
for
the
waters
will
cast
our
house
high
upon
the
shores
of
the
mountain
wherein
the
sun
enters
and
these
shores
are
inaccessible
because
so
then
the
log
was
cast
high
above
the
slippery
bank
and
when
the
waters
receded
there
it
remained
for
the
fangs
grappled
it
fast
then
said
the
maiden
let
us
now
go
out
fear
not
for
your
craft
for
the
fangs
will
hold
it
fast
it
matters
little
how
high
the
waves
may
roll
or
how
steep
and
slippery
the
then
taking
in
his
arms
the
sacred
plumes
which
his
people
had
prepared
for
him
he
followed
the
girl
far
up
to
the
doorway
in
the
mountain
of
the
sea
out
of
it
grew
a
great
ladder
of
giant
rushes
by
the
side
of
which
stood
an
enormous
very
fast
approached
the
sun
and
soon
the
descended
the
ladder
and
the
two
voyagers
followed
down
they
were
gently
greeted
by
a
kind
old
woman
the
grandmother
of
the
sun
and
were
given
seats
at
one
side
of
a
great
and
wonderfully
beautiful
room
then
the
approached
some
pegs
in
the
wall
and
from
them
suspended
his
bow
and
quiver
and
his
bright
and
his
wonderful
travelling
dress
behold
there
stood
kindly
smiling
before
the
youth
and
maiden
the
most
magnificent
and
gentle
of
beings
in
the
world
the
then
the
greeted
them
and
turning
to
a
great
package
which
he
had
brought
in
opened
it
and
disclosed
thousands
of
shell
beads
red
and
white
and
thousands
more
of
brilliant
turquoises
these
he
poured
into
the
great
tray
at
the
and
gave
them
to
the
grandmother
who
forthwith
began
to
sort
them
with
great
rapidity
but
ere
she
had
done
the
took
them
from
her
part
of
them
he
took
out
with
unerring
judgment
and
cast
them
abroad
into
the
great
waters
as
we
cast
sacred
the
others
he
brought
below
and
gave
them
to
the
grandmother
for
then
he
turned
once
more
to
the
youth
and
the
maiden
and
said
to
the
former
so
thou
hast
come
my
child
even
as
i
commanded
it
is
well
and
i
am
then
in
a
stern
and
louder
voice
which
yet
sounded
like
the
voice
of
a
father
he
asked
hast
thou
brought
with
thee
that
whereby
we
are
made
happy
with
our
children
and
the
young
man
said
aye
i
it
is
well
and
if
it
be
well
then
shalt
thou
precious
be
for
knowest
thou
not
that
i
recognize
the
really
good
from
the
evil
even
of
the
thoughts
of
men
and
that
i
know
the
prayer
and
sacrifice
that
is
meant
from
the
words
and
treasures
of
those
who
do
but
lie
in
addressing
them
to
me
and
speak
and
act
as
children
in
a
joke
behold
the
treasure
which
i
brought
with
me
from
the
cities
of
mankind
today
some
of
them
i
cherished
preciously
for
they
are
the
gifts
to
me
of
good
hearts
and
i
treasure
them
that
i
may
return
them
in
good
fortune
and
blessing
to
those
who
gave
them
but
some
thou
sawest
i
cast
abroad
into
the
great
waters
that
they
may
again
be
gathered
up
and
presented
to
me
for
they
were
the
gifts
of
double
and
foolish
hearts
and
as
such
can
not
be
treasured
by
me
nor
returned
unto
those
who
gave
them
bring
forth
my
child
the
plumes
and
gifts
thou
hast
brought
thy
mother
dwelleth
in
the
next
room
and
when
she
appeareth
in
this
thou
shalt
with
thine
own
hand
present
to
her
thy
so
the
youth
bowing
his
head
unwrapped
his
bundle
and
laid
before
the
the
plumes
he
had
brought
and
the
took
them
and
breathed
upon
them
and
upon
the
youth
and
said
thanks
this
day
thou
hast
straightened
thy
crooked
and
when
the
beautiful
mother
of
men
the
the
wife
of
the
appeared
the
boy
placed
before
her
the
plumes
he
had
brought
and
she
too
breathed
upon
them
and
said
thanks
this
day
even
as
the
had
then
the
turned
to
the
youth
and
said
thou
shalt
join
me
in
my
journey
round
the
world
that
thou
mayest
see
the
towns
and
nations
of
mankind
my
children
that
thou
mayest
realize
how
many
are
my
children
four
days
shalt
thou
join
me
in
my
journeyings
and
then
shalt
thou
return
to
the
home
of
thy
and
the
young
man
said
it
is
well
but
he
turned
his
eyes
to
the
maiden
fear
not
my
child
added
the
father
she
shall
sit
preciously
in
my
house
until
we
have
and
after
they
had
feasted
the
again
enrobed
himself
and
the
youth
he
dressed
in
appearance
as
he
himself
was
dressed
then
taking
the
from
the
wall
he
led
the
way
down
through
the
four
great
apartments
of
the
world
and
came
out
into
the
lower
country
of
the
earth
behold
as
they
entered
that
great
world
it
was
filled
with
snow
and
cold
below
and
the
tracks
of
men
led
out
over
great
white
plains
and
as
they
passed
the
cities
of
these
nether
countries
people
strange
to
see
were
clearing
away
the
snow
from
their
and
doorways
and
so
they
journeyed
to
the
other
house
of
the
sun
and
passing
up
through
the
four
great
rooms
entered
the
home
of
the
aunts
of
the
and
here
too
the
young
man
presented
plumes
of
prayer
and
sacrifice
to
the
inmates
and
received
their
thanks
and
blessings
again
they
started
together
on
their
journey
and
behold
as
they
came
out
into
the
world
of
daylight
the
skies
below
them
were
filled
with
the
rain
of
across
the
great
world
they
journeyed
and
they
saw
city
after
city
of
men
and
many
tribes
of
strange
peoples
here
they
were
engaged
in
wars
and
in
wasting
the
lives
of
one
another
there
they
were
dying
of
famine
and
disease
and
more
of
misery
and
poverty
than
of
happiness
saw
the
young
man
among
the
nations
of
men
for
said
the
these
be
alas
my
children
who
waste
their
lives
in
foolishness
or
slay
one
another
in
useless
anger
yet
they
are
brothers
to
one
another
and
i
am
the
father
of
thus
journeyed
they
four
days
and
each
evening
when
they
returned
to
the
home
where
the
enters
he
gave
to
his
grandmother
the
great
package
of
treasure
which
his
children
among
men
had
sacrificed
to
him
and
each
day
he
cast
the
treasures
of
the
bad
and
into
the
great
waters
on
the
fourth
day
when
they
had
entered
the
western
home
of
the
said
the
latter
to
the
youth
thy
task
is
meted
out
and
finished
thou
shalt
now
return
unto
the
home
of
thy
fathers
my
children
below
the
mountains
of
shíwina
how
many
days
thinkest
thou
shalt
thou
journey
many
days
more
than
ten
replied
the
youth
with
a
sigh
ah
no
my
child
said
the
listen
thou
shalt
in
one
day
reach
the
banks
of
the
river
whence
thou
camest
listen
thou
shalt
take
this
my
shaft
of
strong
lightning
thou
shalt
grasp
its
neck
with
firm
hands
and
as
thou
extendest
it
it
will
stretch
out
far
to
thy
front
and
draw
thee
more
swiftly
than
the
arrow
s
flight
through
the
water
take
with
thee
this
quiver
of
unerring
arrows
and
this
strong
bow
that
by
their
will
thou
mayest
seek
life
but
forget
not
thy
sacrifices
nor
that
they
are
to
be
made
with
true
word
and
a
faithful
heart
take
also
with
thee
thy
guide
and
companion
the
rattlesnake
maiden
when
thou
hast
arrived
at
the
shore
of
the
country
of
her
people
let
go
the
lightning
and
it
will
land
thee
high
on
the
morrow
i
will
journey
slowly
that
ere
i
be
done
rising
thou
mayest
reach
the
home
of
the
maiden
there
thou
must
stop
but
briefly
for
thy
fathers
the
serpents
will
instruct
thee
and
to
their
counsel
thou
must
pay
strict
heed
for
thus
only
will
it
be
well
thou
shalt
present
to
them
the
plumes
of
the
thou
bringest
and
when
thou
hast
presented
these
thou
must
continue
thy
journey
rest
thou
until
the
morrow
and
early
as
the
light
speed
hence
toward
the
home
of
thy
fathers
may
all
days
find
ye
children
with
this
the
scarce
listening
to
the
prayers
and
thanks
of
the
youth
and
maiden
vanished
below
thus
when
morning
approached
the
youth
and
the
maiden
entered
the
hollow
house
and
closed
it
scarce
did
the
youth
grasp
the
lightning
when
drawn
by
the
bright
shaft
the
log
shot
far
out
into
the
great
waters
and
was
skimming
too
fast
to
be
seen
toward
the
home
of
the
serpents
and
the
sun
had
but
just
climbed
above
the
mountains
of
this
world
of
daylight
when
the
little
tube
was
thrown
high
above
the
banks
of
the
great
island
whither
they
were
journeying
then
the
youth
and
the
maiden
again
entered
the
council
of
the
rattlesnakes
and
when
they
saw
the
shining
black
paint
on
his
face
they
asked
that
they
too
might
paint
their
faces
like
his
own
but
they
painted
their
cheeks
awkwardly
as
to
this
day
may
be
seen
for
all
rattlesnakes
are
painted
unevenly
in
the
face
then
the
young
man
presented
to
each
the
plumes
he
had
brought
and
told
the
elders
that
he
would
return
with
their
maiden
to
the
home
of
his
father
be
it
well
that
it
may
be
well
they
replied
and
they
thanked
him
with
delight
for
the
he
had
bestowed
upon
them
go
ye
happily
all
days
said
the
elders
listen
child
and
father
to
our
words
of
advice
but
a
little
while
and
thou
wilt
reach
the
bank
whence
thou
started
let
go
the
shaft
of
lightning
and
behold
the
tube
thou
hast
journeyed
with
will
plunge
far
down
into
the
river
then
shalt
thou
journey
with
this
our
maiden
three
days
care
not
to
embrace
her
for
if
thou
doest
this
it
will
not
be
well
journey
ye
preciously
our
children
and
may
ye
be
happy
one
with
the
so
again
they
entered
their
hollow
log
and
before
entering
the
maiden
placed
her
rattlesnake
skin
as
before
on
the
fangs
with
incredible
swiftness
the
lightning
drew
them
up
the
great
surging
river
to
the
banks
where
the
cottonwood
forests
grow
and
when
the
lad
pressed
the
shaft
it
landed
them
high
among
the
forest
trees
above
the
steep
bank
then
the
youth
pressed
the
with
all
his
might
and
the
log
was
dashed
into
the
great
river
while
yet
he
gazed
at
the
bounding
log
behold
the
fangs
which
the
maiden
had
fixed
into
it
turned
to
living
serpents
hence
today
throughout
the
whole
great
world
from
the
land
of
summer
to
the
waters
of
sunset
are
found
the
rattlesnakes
and
their
children
then
the
young
man
journeyed
with
the
maiden
southward
and
on
the
way
with
the
bow
and
arrows
the
had
given
him
he
killed
game
that
they
might
have
meat
to
eat
nor
did
he
forget
the
commandments
of
his
at
night
he
built
a
fire
in
a
forest
of
piñons
and
made
a
bower
for
the
maiden
near
to
it
but
she
could
not
sit
there
for
she
feared
the
fire
and
its
light
pained
her
eyes
nor
could
she
eat
at
first
of
the
food
he
cooked
for
her
but
only
tasted
a
few
mouthfuls
of
it
then
the
young
man
made
a
bed
for
her
under
the
trees
and
told
her
to
rest
peacefully
for
he
would
guard
her
through
the
night
and
thus
they
journeyed
and
rested
until
the
fourth
day
when
at
evening
they
entered
the
town
under
the
mountains
of
shíwina
and
were
happily
welcomed
by
the
father
sister
and
relatives
of
the
young
man
blessed
by
the
old
the
youth
and
the
maiden
dwelt
with
the
younger
sister
waíasialuhtitsa
in
the
high
house
of
the
upper
part
of
the
town
and
the
boy
was
as
before
a
mighty
hunter
and
the
maiden
at
last
grew
used
to
the
food
and
ways
of
mortals
after
they
had
thus
lived
together
for
a
long
time
there
were
born
of
the
maiden
two
children
twins
wonderful
to
relate
these
children
grew
to
the
power
of
wandering
in
a
single
day
and
night
and
hence
when
they
appeared
suddenly
on
the
and
in
the
plazas
people
said
to
one
another
who
are
these
strange
people
and
whence
came
they
and
talked
much
after
the
manner
of
our
foolish
people
and
the
other
little
children
in
the
town
beat
them
and
quarrelled
with
them
as
strange
children
are
apt
to
do
with
strange
children
and
when
the
twins
ran
in
to
their
mother
crying
and
complaining
the
poor
young
woman
was
saddened
so
she
said
to
the
father
when
he
returned
from
hunting
in
the
evening
ah
their
father
it
is
not
well
that
we
remain
longer
here
no
alas
i
must
return
to
the
country
of
my
fathers
and
take
with
me
these
little
ones
and
although
the
father
prayed
her
not
she
said
only
it
must
be
and
he
was
forced
to
consent
then
for
four
days
the
rattlesnake
woman
instructed
him
in
the
prayers
and
chants
of
her
people
and
she
took
him
forth
and
showed
him
the
medicines
whereby
the
bite
of
her
fathers
might
be
assuaged
and
how
to
prepare
them
again
and
again
the
young
man
urged
her
not
to
leave
him
saying
the
way
is
long
and
filled
with
dangers
how
alas
will
you
reach
it
in
safety
fear
not
said
she
go
with
me
only
to
the
shore
of
the
great
river
and
my
fathers
will
come
to
meet
me
and
take
me
sadly
on
the
last
morning
the
father
accompanied
his
wife
and
children
to
the
forests
of
the
great
river
there
she
said
he
must
not
follow
but
as
he
embraced
them
he
cried
out
ah
alas
my
beautiful
wife
my
beloved
children
flesh
of
my
flesh
how
shall
i
not
follow
ye
then
his
wife
answered
fear
not
nor
trouble
thyself
with
sad
thoughts
whither
we
go
thou
canst
not
follow
for
thou
eatest
cooked
food
thou
art
a
mortal
but
soon
thy
fathers
and
mine
will
come
for
thee
and
thou
wilt
follow
us
never
to
then
she
turned
from
him
with
the
little
children
and
was
seen
no
more
and
the
young
man
silently
returned
to
his
home
below
the
mountains
of
shíwina
it
happened
here
and
there
in
time
that
young
men
of
his
tribe
were
bitten
by
rattlesnakes
but
the
young
man
had
only
to
suck
their
wounds
and
apply
his
medicines
and
sing
his
incantations
and
prayers
to
cure
them
whenever
this
happened
he
breathed
the
sacred
breath
upon
them
and
enjoined
them
to
secrecy
of
the
rituals
and
chants
he
taught
them
save
only
to
such
as
they
should
choose
and
teach
the
practice
of
their
prayers
thus
he
had
cured
and
taught
eight
when
one
day
he
ascended
the
mountains
for
wood
there
alone
in
the
forest
he
was
met
and
bitten
by
his
fathers
although
he
slowly
and
painfully
crawled
home
long
ere
he
reached
his
town
he
was
so
swollen
that
the
eight
whom
he
had
instructed
tried
in
vain
to
cure
him
and
bidding
them
cherish
as
a
precious
gift
the
knowledge
of
his
beloved
wife
he
died
immediately
his
fathers
met
his
breath
and
being
and
took
them
to
the
home
of
the
maiden
of
the
rattlesnakes
and
of
his
lost
children
need
we
ask
why
he
was
not
cured
by
his
disciples
thus
it
was
in
the
days
of
the
ancients
and
hence
today
we
have
fathers
amongst
us
to
whom
the
dread
bite
of
the
rattlesnake
need
cause
no
sad
thoughts
the
society
of
the
rattlesnakes
thus
much
and
thus
shortened

how
áhaiyúta
and
mátsailéma
stole
the
and
the
áhaiyúta
and
mátsailéma
with
their
grandmother
lived
where
now
stands
the
ancient
middle
place
of
sacrifice
on
thunder
mountain
one
day
they
went
out
hunting
and
while
they
were
running
about
from
one
village
to
another
it
began
to
rain
which
made
the
trail
slippery
and
the
ground
muddy
so
that
the
boys
became
a
little
wrathful
then
they
sat
down
and
cursed
the
rain
for
a
brief
space
off
in
the
south
it
thundered
until
the
earth
trembled
and
the
flew
about
the
clouds
until
the
two
brothers
were
nearly
blinded
with
the
beholding
of
it
presently
the
younger
brother
smoothed
his
brow
and
jumped
up
with
an
exclamation
somewhat
profane
and
cried
out
elder
brother
let
us
go
to
the
land
of
everlasting
summer
and
steal
from
the
gods
in
council
their
thunder
and
lightning
i
think
it
would
be
fine
fun
to
do
that
sort
of
thing
we
have
just
been
looking
at
and
listening
the
elder
brother
was
somewhat
more
cautious
still
on
the
whole
he
liked
the
idea
so
he
said
let
us
take
our
home
to
the
grandmother
that
she
shall
have
something
to
eat
meanwhile
and
we
will
think
about
going
tomorrow
the
next
morning
bright
and
early
they
started
out
in
vain
the
old
grandmother
called
rather
crossly
after
them
where
are
you
going
now
she
could
get
no
satisfaction
for
she
knew
they
lied
when
they
called
back
oh
we
are
only
going
to
hunt
more
it
is
true
that
they
skulked
round
in
the
plains
about
thunder
mountain
a
little
while
as
if
looking
for
then
picking
up
their
wondrously
swift
heels
they
sped
away
toward
that
beautiful
country
of
the
corals
the
land
of
everlasting
summer
at
last
it
may
be
in
the
mountains
of
that
country
which
are
said
to
glow
like
shells
of
the
sea
or
the
clouds
of
the
sunset
they
came
to
the
house
of
the
beloved
gods
themselves
and
that
red
house
was
a
wondrous
terrace
rising
wall
after
wall
and
step
after
step
like
a
high
mountain
grand
and
stately
and
the
walls
were
so
smooth
and
high
that
the
skill
and
power
of
the
little
availed
them
nothing
they
could
not
get
in
what
shall
we
do
asked
the
younger
brother
go
home
said
the
elder
and
mind
our
own
oh
no
urged
the
younger
i
have
it
elder
brother
let
us
hunt
up
our
grandfather
the
good
replied
the
elder
a
happy
thought
is
that
of
yours
my
brother
forthwith
they
laid
down
their
bows
and
quivers
of
skin
their
shields
and
other
things
and
set
about
turning
over
all
the
flat
stones
they
could
find
presently
lifting
one
with
their
united
strength
they
found
under
it
the
very
old
fellow
they
sought
he
doubled
himself
and
covered
his
eyes
from
the
sharpness
of
the
daylight
he
did
not
much
like
being
thus
disturbed
even
by
his
grandchildren
the
in
the
middle
of
his
nap
and
was
by
no
means
polite
to
them
but
they
prodded
him
a
little
in
the
side
and
said
now
grandfather
look
here
we
are
in
difficulty
and
there
is
no
one
in
the
wide
world
who
can
help
us
out
as
you
the
old
centipede
was
naturally
flattered
he
unrolled
himself
and
viewed
them
with
a
look
which
he
intended
to
be
extremely
reproachful
and
belittling
ah
my
grandchildren
said
he
what
are
you
up
to
now
are
you
trying
to
get
yourselves
into
trouble
as
usual
no
doubt
of
it
i
will
help
you
all
i
can
but
the
consequences
be
on
your
own
heads
that
s
right
grandfather
that
s
right
no
one
in
the
world
could
help
us
as
you
can
said
one
of
them
the
fact
is
we
want
to
get
hold
of
the
and
the
which
the
up
there
in
the
tremendous
house
keep
and
guard
so
carefully
we
understand
now
in
the
first
place
we
can
not
get
up
the
wall
in
the
second
place
if
we
did
we
would
probably
have
a
fuss
with
them
in
trying
to
steal
these
things
therefore
we
want
you
to
help
us
if
you
with
all
my
heart
my
boys
but
i
should
advise
you
to
run
along
home
to
your
grandmother
and
let
these
things
oh
pshaw
nonsense
we
are
only
going
to
play
a
little
while
with
the
thunder
and
all
right
replied
the
old
worm
sit
here
and
wait
for
he
wriggled
himself
and
stirred
about
and
his
countless
legs
were
more
countless
than
ever
with
rapid
motions
as
he
ran
toward
the
walls
of
that
stately
terrace
a
vine
could
not
have
run
up
more
closely
nor
a
bird
more
rapidly
for
if
one
foot
slipped
another
held
on
so
the
old
centipede
wriggled
himself
up
the
sides
and
over
the
roof
down
into
the
great
and
scorning
the
ladder
which
he
feared
might
creak
he
went
along
on
the
ceiling
to
the
end
of
the
room
over
the
altar
ran
down
the
side
and
approached
that
most
forbidden
of
places
the
altar
of
the
gods
themselves
the
beloved
gods
in
silent
majesty
were
sitting
there
with
their
heads
bowed
in
meditation
so
deep
that
they
heard
not
the
faint
scuffle
of
the
centipede
s
feet
as
he
wound
himself
down
into
the
altar
and
stole
the
he
took
it
in
his
mouth
which
was
larger
than
the
mouths
of
centipedes
are
now
and
carried
it
silently
weighty
as
it
was
up
the
way
he
had
come
over
the
roof
down
the
wall
and
back
to
the
flat
stone
where
he
made
his
home
and
where
hardly
able
to
contain
themselves
with
impatience
the
two
youthful
gods
were
awaiting
him
here
he
comes
cried
the
younger
brother
and
he
s
got
it
by
my
he
s
got
it
the
old
grandfather
threw
the
stone
down
it
began
to
sound
but
áhaiyúta
grabbed
it
and
as
it
were
throttled
its
speech
good
good
he
cried
to
the
grandfather
thank
you
old
grandfather
thank
you
hold
on
cried
the
younger
brother
you
didn
t
bring
both
what
can
we
do
with
the
one
without
the
other
shut
up
cried
the
old
worm
i
know
what
i
am
about
and
before
they
could
say
any
more
he
was
off
again
ere
long
he
returned
carrying
the
shaft
of
lightning
with
its
blue
shimmering
point
in
his
mouth
good
cried
the
and
the
younger
brother
caught
up
the
lightning
and
almost
forgot
his
weapons
which
however
he
did
stop
to
take
up
and
started
on
a
full
run
for
thunder
mountain
followed
by
his
more
deliberate
but
equally
interested
elder
brother
who
brought
along
the
which
he
found
a
somewhat
heavier
burden
than
he
had
supposed
it
was
not
long
you
may
well
imagine
so
powerful
were
these
gods
of
war
ere
they
reached
the
home
of
their
grandmother
on
the
top
of
thunder
mountain
they
had
carefully
concealed
the
and
the
shaft
of
lightning
meanwhile
and
had
taken
care
to
provide
themselves
with
a
few
by
way
of
deception
still
in
majestic
revery
unmoved
and
apparently
unwitting
of
what
had
taken
place
sat
the
in
their
home
in
the
mountains
of
summerland
not
long
after
they
arrived
the
young
gods
began
to
grow
curious
and
anxious
to
try
their
new
playthings
they
poked
one
another
considerably
and
whispered
a
great
deal
so
that
their
grandmother
began
to
suspect
they
were
about
to
play
some
rash
joke
or
other
and
presently
she
espied
the
point
of
lightning
gleaming
under
mátsailéma
s
dirty
jacket
demons
and
corpses
she
cried
by
the
moon
you
have
stolen
the
and
from
the
gods
of
rain
themselves
go
this
instant
and
return
them
and
never
do
such
a
thing
again
she
cried
with
the
utmost
severity
and
making
a
quick
step
for
the
fireplace
she
picked
up
a
poker
with
which
to
belabor
their
backs
when
they
whisked
out
of
the
room
and
into
another
they
slammed
the
door
in
their
grandmother
s
face
and
braced
it
and
clearing
away
a
lot
of
rubbish
that
was
lying
around
the
rear
room
they
established
themselves
in
one
end
and
nodding
and
winking
at
one
another
cried
out
now
then
the
younger
let
go
the
the
elder
rolled
the
the
lightning
hissed
through
the
air
and
far
out
into
the
sky
and
returned
the
rolled
and
rumbled
until
it
shook
the
foundations
of
the
mountain
glorious
fun
cried
the
boys
rubbing
their
thighs
in
ecstasy
of
delight
do
it
again
and
again
they
sent
forth
the
lightning
and
rolled
the
and
now
the
gods
in
summerland
arose
in
their
majesty
and
breathed
upon
the
skies
and
the
winds
rose
and
the
rains
fell
like
rivers
from
the
clouds
centering
their
violence
upon
the
roof
of
the
poor
old
grandmother
s
house
heedlessly
those
reckless
wretches
kept
on
playing
the
and
without
the
slightest
regard
to
the
tremendous
commotion
they
were
raising
all
through
the
skies
and
all
over
thunder
mountain
but
nowhere
else
as
above
the
house
where
their
poor
old
grandmother
lived
fell
the
torrent
of
the
rain
and
there
alone
of
course
burst
the
lightning
and
rolled
the
thunder
soon
the
water
poured
through
the
roof
of
the
house
but
move
the
things
as
the
old
grandmother
would
she
could
not
keep
them
dry
scold
the
boys
as
she
would
she
could
not
make
them
desist
no
they
would
only
go
on
with
their
play
more
violently
than
ever
exclaiming
what
has
she
to
say
anyway
it
won
t
hurt
her
to
get
a
good
ducking
and
this
is
fun
the
waters
rose
so
high
that
they
extinguished
the
fire
soon
they
rose
still
higher
so
that
the
had
to
paddle
around
half
submerged
still
they
kept
rolling
the
and
shooting
the
lightning
the
old
grandmother
scolded
harder
and
harder
but
after
awhile
desisted
and
climbed
to
the
top
of
the
fireplace
whence
after
recovering
from
her
exertion
she
began
again
but
the
boys
heeded
her
not
only
saying
let
her
yell
let
her
scold
this
is
fun
at
last
they
began
to
take
the
old
grandmother
s
scolding
as
a
matter
of
course
and
allowed
nothing
but
the
water
to
interrupt
their
pastime
it
rose
so
high
finally
that
they
were
near
drowning
then
they
climbed
to
the
roof
but
still
they
kept
on
by
the
bones
of
the
dead
why
did
we
not
think
to
come
here
before
tis
ten
times
as
fine
up
here
see
him
shoot
cried
one
to
the
other
as
the
lightning
sped
through
the
sky
ever
returning
hear
it
mutter
and
roll
cried
the
other
as
the
thunder
bellowed
and
grumbled
but
no
sooner
had
the
two
begun
their
sport
on
the
roof
than
the
rain
fell
in
one
vast
sheet
all
about
them
and
it
was
not
long
ere
the
house
was
so
full
that
the
old
grandmother
locked
in
as
she
was
bobbed
her
poor
pate
on
the
rafters
in
trying
to
keep
it
above
the
water
she
gulped
water
and
gasped
coughed
strangled
and
shrieked
to
no
purpose
what
a
fuss
our
old
grandmother
is
making
to
be
sure
cried
the
boys
and
they
kept
on
until
forsooth
the
water
had
completely
filled
the
room
and
the
grandmother
s
cries
gurgled
away
and
ceased
finally
the
grew
so
terrific
and
the
lightning
so
hot
and
unmanageable
that
the
boys
drawing
a
long
breath
and
thinking
with
immense
satisfaction
of
the
fun
they
had
had
possibly
also
influenced
as
to
the
safety
of
the
house
which
was
beginning
to
totter
flung
the
and
the
into
the
sky
where
rattling
and
flashing
away
they
finally
disappeared
over
the
mountains
in
the
south
then
the
clouds
rolled
away
and
the
sun
shone
out
and
the
boys
wet
to
the
skin
tired
in
good
earnest
and
hungry
as
well
looked
around
goodness
the
water
is
running
out
of
the
windows
of
our
house
this
is
a
pretty
mess
we
are
in
grandmother
grandmother
they
shouted
open
the
door
and
let
us
in
but
the
old
grandmother
had
piped
her
last
and
never
a
sound
came
except
that
of
flowing
water
they
sat
themselves
down
on
the
roof
and
waited
for
the
water
to
get
lower
then
they
climbed
down
and
pounded
open
the
door
and
the
water
came
out
with
a
rush
and
out
with
a
rush
too
their
poor
old
grandmother
her
eyes
staring
her
hair
all
mopped
and
muddied
and
her
fingers
and
legs
as
stiff
as
cedar
sticks
oh
ye
gods
ye
gods
the
two
boys
exclaimed
we
have
killed
our
own
grandmother
poor
old
grandmother
who
scolded
us
so
hard
and
loved
us
so
much
let
us
bury
her
here
in
front
of
the
door
as
soon
as
the
water
has
run
so
as
soon
as
it
became
dry
enough
there
they
buried
her
and
in
less
than
four
days
a
strange
plant
grew
up
on
that
spot
and
on
its
little
branches
amid
its
bright
green
leaves
hung
long
pointed
pods
of
fruit
as
red
as
the
fire
on
the
breast
of
the
it
is
well
said
the
boys
as
they
stood
one
day
looking
at
this
plant
let
us
scatter
the
seeds
abroad
that
men
may
find
and
plant
them
it
seems
it
was
not
without
good
cause
that
in
the
abandonment
to
our
sport
we
killed
our
old
grandmother
for
out
of
her
heart
there
sprung
a
plant
into
the
fruits
of
which
as
it
were
has
flowed
the
color
as
well
as
the
fire
of
her
scolding
tongue
and
if
we
have
lost
our
grandmother
whom
we
loved
much
but
who
loved
us
more
men
have
gained
a
new
food
which
though
it
burn
them
shall
please
them
more
than
did
the
heat
of
her
discourse
please
us
poor
old
grandmother
men
will
little
dream
when
they
eat
peppers
that
the
seed
of
them
first
arose
from
the
fiery
heart
of
the
grandmother
of
áhaiyúta
and
thereupon
the
two
seized
the
pods
and
crushed
them
between
their
hands
with
an
exclamation
of
pleasure
at
the
brisk
odor
they
gave
forth
they
cast
the
seeds
abroad
which
seeds
here
and
there
took
root
and
the
plants
which
sprang
from
them
being
found
by
men
were
esteemed
good
and
were
cultivated
as
they
are
to
this
day
in
the
pepper
gardens
of
zuñi
ever
since
this
time
you
hear
that
mountain
wherein
lived
the
gods
with
their
grandmother
called
thunder
mountain
and
often
indeed
to
this
day
the
lightning
flashes
and
the
thunder
plays
over
its
brows
and
the
rain
falls
there
most
frequently
it
is
said
by
some
that
the
two
boys
when
asked
how
they
stole
the
and
the
told
on
their
poor
old
grandfather
the
centipede
the
beloved
gods
of
the
rain
gave
him
the
to
handle
in
another
way
and
it
so
burned
and
shrivelled
him
that
he
became
small
as
you
can
see
by
looking
at
any
of
his
numerous
descendants
who
are
not
only
small
but
appear
like
a
bit
of
buckskin
fringed
at
the
edges
so
shortens
my
story
illustration
a
hopi
moki
maiden

the

of
moki
illustration
a
young
moki
woman
we
take
up
a
story
of
the
times
of
the
ancients
a
story
listen
ye
young
ones
and
youths
and
from
what
i
say
draw
inference
for
behold
the
youth
of
our
nation
in
these
recent
generations
have
become
less
sturdy
than
of
old
else
what
i
relate
had
not
happened
to
our
shame
be
it
told
that
not
many
generations
ago
there
lived
in
moki
a
poor
outcast
of
a
young
man
a
youth
yet
nevertheless
the
hero
of
my
story
for
this
youth
the
in
the
numbering
of
the
men
of
moki
in
those
days
alone
brought
great
grief
on
the
nation
of
zuñi
and
it
happened
that
in
walpi
on
the
first
mesa
of
the
mokis
there
lived
an
amiable
charming
and
surpassingly
beautiful
girl
whose
face
was
shining
eyes
bright
cheeks
red
like
the
on
the
datila
whose
hair
was
abundant
and
soft
black
and
waving
and
done
up
in
large
whorls
above
her
ears
larger
than
those
of
the
other
maidens
of
her
town
or
nation
and
whose
beautiful
possessions
were
as
many
as
were
the
charms
of
her
person
fruit
of
the
yucca
or
plant
what
wonder
then
that
the
youths
of
the
moki
towns
should
be
enamored
of
her
and
seek
constantly
with
much
urgent
bespeaking
for
the
favor
of
her
affections
yet
she
would
none
of
them
she
would
shake
her
head
with
a
saucy
smile
and
reply
to
every
one
as
well
as
to
every
recommendation
of
one
from
her
elders
a
hero
for
me
or
no
one
any
one
of
these
young
men
may
win
my
affections
if
he
will
for
who
knows
until
the
time
comes
whether
a
man
be
a
hero
or
not
so
she
made
a
proposition
she
said
to
all
the
youths
who
came
suing
for
her
hand
behold
our
nation
is
at
enmity
with
the
zuñis
far
off
to
the
eastward
over
the
mountains
if
any
of
you
be
so
stout
of
limb
and
strong
of
heart
and
brave
of
will
let
him
go
to
zuñi
slay
the
men
of
that
nation
our
enemies
and
bring
home
not
only
as
proofs
of
his
valor
but
as
presentations
to
the
warrior
societies
of
our
people
scalps
in
goodly
number
him
will
i
admire
to
the
tips
of
my
eyelashes
him
will
i
cherish
to
the
extent
of
my
powers
him
will
i
make
my
husband
and
in
such
a
husband
will
i
glory
but
most
of
the
young
and
handsome
suitors
who
worried
her
with
their
importunities
would
depart
forthwith
crestfallen
loving
the
girl
as
they
did
forsooth
much
less
than
they
feared
the
warriors
of
zuñi
so
degenerate
they
had
become
for
shame
months
passed
by
not
one
of
those
who
went
to
the
maiden
s
house
full
of
love
came
away
from
it
with
as
much
love
as
want
of
valor
at
last
this
outcast
youth
i
have
mentioned
who
was
spoken
to
by
none
who
lived
not
even
in
the
houses
of
his
people
but
all
filth
and
rags
made
himself
comfortable
as
best
he
could
with
the
dogs
and
eagles
and
other
creatures
captive
of
the
people
eating
like
them
the
castaway
and
unwholesome
scraps
of
ordinary
meals
heard
these
jilted
lovers
conversing
from
time
to
time
exclaiming
one
to
another
a
valuable
maiden
indeed
for
whom
one
would
risk
one
s
life
single
handed
against
a
nation
whose
ancients
ever
prevailed
over
all
men
no
though
she
be
the
loveliest
of
women
i
care
not
for
her
on
those
nor
i
nor
i
others
would
exclaim
overhearing
this
talk
the
youth
formed
a
most
presumptuous
resolution
no
other
in
fact
than
this
that
he
himself
would
woo
the
maiden
all
dirty
and
ragged
as
he
was
with
hair
unkempt
long
and
person
calloused
by
much
exposure
lean
and
wiry
like
an
abused
but
hardened
cur
he
took
himself
one
night
to
the
home
of
the
maiden
s
father
he
exclaimed
at
the
entrance
of
the
house
on
the
top
and
the
people
within
called
out
are
ye
in
inquired
the
youth
in
such
an
affable
and
finished
tone
and
manner
of
speaking
that
the
people
expected
to
see
some
magnificent
youth
enter
and
to
listen
to
his
proposal
of
marriage
with
their
maiden
when
they
called
out
come
in
and
he
came
stepping
down
the
ladder
into
the
lighted
room
they
were
therefore
greatly
surprised
to
see
this
vagabond
in
the
place
of
what
they
expected
nevertheless
the
old
father
greeted
him
pleasantly
and
politely
and
showed
him
a
seat
before
the
fireplace
and
bade
the
women
set
food
before
him
and
the
youth
although
he
had
not
for
many
a
day
tasted
good
food
or
consumed
a
full
meal
even
ate
quite
sparingly
and
having
finished
joined
by
the
old
man
s
invitation
in
the
smoking
and
conversation
of
the
evening
at
last
the
old
man
asked
him
what
he
came
thinking
of
and
the
youth
stated
that
although
it
might
seem
presumptuous
he
had
heard
of
the
conditions
which
the
maiden
of
this
house
had
made
for
those
who
would
win
her
and
it
had
occurred
to
him
that
he
would
be
glad
to
try
so
little
were
his
merits
yet
so
great
his
love
the
old
man
listened
with
an
inward
smile
and
the
maiden
though
she
conceived
no
dislike
for
the
youth
there
was
something
about
him
strange
to
say
now
that
his
voice
had
been
heard
which
changed
her
opinion
of
him
nevertheless
was
quite
merry
all
to
herself
over
this
proposal
so
when
she
was
asked
what
she
thought
of
the
matter
merely
to
test
the
seriousness
of
the
young
vagabond
s
motives
she
made
the
conditions
for
him
even
harder
than
she
had
for
the
others
saying
look
you
stranger
if
you
will
slay
some
of
the
warriors
of
the
valiant
zuñis
and
bring
back
to
our
town
to
the
joy
of
our
warriors
and
people
a
goodly
number
of
their
scalps
i
will
indeed
wed
you
as
i
have
said
i
would
the
this
satisfied
the
youth
and
bidding
them
all
pass
a
happy
night
he
went
forth
into
the
dark
not
quite
so
poor
and
helpless
as
he
seemed
was
this
youth
but
one
of
those
wonderful
beings
of
this
earth
in
reality
for
behold
as
he
had
lived
all
his
days
since
childhood
with
the
dogs
and
eagles
and
other
captive
animals
of
the
towns
of
so
from
long
association
with
them
he
had
learned
their
ways
and
language
and
had
gained
their
friendship
and
allegiance
as
no
other
mortal
ever
did
no
family
had
he
no
one
to
advise
him
save
this
great
family
of
dogs
and
other
animals
with
which
he
lived
what
do
you
suppose
he
did
he
went
to
each
hole
sheltered
nook
and
oven
in
the
town
and
called
on
the
dogs
to
join
him
in
council
not
long
before
morning
of
that
same
night
every
dog
in
the
town
answered
the
summons
and
below
the
mesa
on
which
walpi
stands
on
one
of
those
sloping
banks
lighted
by
the
moon
they
gathered
and
made
a
tremendous
clamor
with
their
yelpings
and
barkings
and
other
noises
such
as
you
are
accustomed
to
hear
from
dogs
at
the
proposition
which
the
youth
made
to
this
council
of
dogs
was
as
follows
my
friends
and
brothers
i
am
about
to
go
forth
on
the
path
of
war
to
the
cities
of
the
zuñis
toward
the
sunrise
if
i
succeed
my
reward
will
be
great
now
as
i
well
know
from
having
lived
amongst
you
and
been
one
of
you
so
long
there
are
two
things
which
are
more
prized
in
a
dog
s
life
than
anything
else
an
occasional
good
feast
is
one
of
them
being
let
alone
is
another
i
think
i
can
bring
about
both
of
these
rewards
for
you
all
if
you
will
four
days
hence
after
i
have
prepared
a
sufficiency
of
food
for
the
party
join
me
in
my
warlike
expedition
against
the
the
dogs
greeted
this
proposition
with
vociferous
acclamation
and
the
council
dispersed
on
the
following
day
toward
evening
the
youth
again
presented
himself
at
the
home
of
the
maiden
my
friends
said
he
to
the
family
i
am
as
you
know
or
can
easily
perceive
extremely
poor
i
have
no
home
nor
source
of
food
yet
as
i
anticipate
that
i
shall
be
long
on
this
journey
and
as
i
neither
possess
nor
know
how
to
use
a
bow
and
arrow
i
come
to
humbly
beseech
your
assistance
i
will
undertake
this
thing
which
has
been
proposed
to
me
but
in
order
that
i
may
be
enabled
the
more
easily
to
do
so
i
desire
that
you
will
present
to
me
a
sufficiency
of
food
for
my
journey
or
if
you
will
lend
it
to
me
i
shall
be
now
the
maiden
s
people
were
among
the
first
in
the
nation
and
in
all
ways
they
most
willingly
consented
to
give
the
young
man
not
only
a
sufficiency
of
food
for
days
but
for
months
and
when
he
went
away
that
night
he
had
all
that
he
could
carry
of
meal
coarse
and
fine
or
moki
tortillas
and
abundant
which
he
well
knew
would
be
most
tempting
to
dogs
on
the
fourth
day
thereafter
for
he
had
been
making
his
weapons
some
flint
knives
and
a
good
hard
at
evening
he
again
called
at
each
of
the
holes
and
places
the
dogs
of
the
town
inhabited
and
he
said
to
all
of
them
i
shall
leave
forthwith
on
my
journey
having
provided
myself
with
a
sufficiency
of
food
for
much
feasting
on
the
way
like
yourselves
i
have
become
inured
to
hardship
and
am
swift
of
foot
and
by
midnight
i
shall
be
to
zuñi
as
soon
as
the
people
are
asleep
that
they
may
not
pelt
you
with
stones
and
drive
you
back
follow
on
the
trail
to
zuñi
as
fast
as
you
can
i
will
await
you
by
the
side
of
the
black
mountains
near
the
spring
of
the
and
there
i
will
cook
the
provisions
that
we
may
have
a
jolly
feast
and
the
more
strongly
proceed
on
our
journey
the
day
the
dogs
gave
him
repeated
assurances
of
their
willingness
to
follow
and
heavily
laden
with
his
provisions
the
youth
just
at
dusk
climbed
unobserved
down
the
nether
side
of
the
mesa
and
set
out
through
the
plains
of
sagebrush
over
the
hills
far
east
of
moki
and
so
on
along
the
plateaus
and
valleys
leading
to
this
our
town
of
zuñi
at
the
place
he
had
appointed
as
a
rendezvous
he
arrived
not
long
before
midnight
lighted
a
fire
unstrapped
his
provisions
and
began
to
cook
mush
in
great
quantities
now
after
the
lights
in
the
windows
of
moki
began
to
go
out
shutting
up
their
red
eyes
as
it
were
as
the
maidens
of
moki
shut
up
their
bright
eyes
there
was
tremendous
activity
observed
among
the
dogs
but
they
made
not
much
noise
about
it
until
every
last
dog
in
town
as
motley
a
crowd
of
curs
and
mongrels
as
ever
were
seen
unless
one
might
see
all
the
dogs
of
moki
today
descended
the
mesa
and
one
by
one
gathered
in
a
great
pack
and
started
baying
barking
and
howling
louder
and
louder
as
they
went
along
over
the
eastern
hills
on
the
trail
which
the
youth
had
taken
he
heard
them
coming
they
sounded
as
they
ran
they
came
baying
and
barking
in
all
sorts
of
voices
nearer
and
nearer
so
the
youth
prepared
his
provisions
and
as
the
nearest
of
them
came
into
the
light
of
the
fire
cried
out
ho
my
friends
ye
come
i
am
glad
to
see
ye
come
sit
ye
round
my
let
us
feast
and
be
merry
and
lighten
the
load
of
my
provisions
methinks
we
will
all
carry
some
of
them
when
we
start
out
thereupon
he
liberally
distributed
mush
tortillas
and
paper
bread
inviting
the
hot
tired
dogs
to
drink
their
fill
from
the
spring
and
eat
their
fill
from
the
feast
the
dogs
being
very
hungry
as
dogs
always
are
and
the
more
so
from
the
memory
of
many
a
long
fast
fell
to
with
avidity
and
you
know
what
that
means
with
dogs
and
the
and
beagles
would
not
have
fared
very
well
had
the
youth
not
considered
them
and
held
back
a
good
supply
of
provisions
against
their
tardy
appearance
finally
when
all
were
assembled
and
had
eaten
if
not
to
their
satisfaction
that
was
impossible
yet
to
their
temporary
gratification
a
merry
noisy
crowd
they
became
some
lay
down
and
rested
others
were
impatient
for
the
journey
so
that
even
before
daylight
the
youth
making
up
his
bundle
of
provisions
again
set
forth
at
a
swift
trot
followed
by
this
pack
of
dogs
which
ran
along
either
side
of
him
and
strung
out
on
the
trail
the
length
of
a
behind
him
before
night
see
this
valiant
youth
quietly
hiding
himself
away
in
one
of
the
deep
arroyos
around
the
western
end
of
grand
mountain
and
the
of
twin
mountain
near
which
as
you
know
the
trail
from
moki
leads
to
our
town
he
is
giving
directions
to
the
dogs
in
a
quiet
manner
and
feeding
them
again
rather
more
sparingly
than
at
first
that
they
may
be
anxious
for
their
work
he
says
to
them
my
friends
and
brothers
lay
yourselves
about
here
each
one
according
to
his
color
in
places
most
suited
for
concealment
some
near
the
gray
and
you
fellows
with
fine
marks
on
your
backs
keep
out
of
sight
pray
in
these
deep
holes
and
come
in
as
our
reserve
force
when
we
want
you
now
lie
here
patiently
for
you
will
have
enough
work
to
do
and
can
afford
to
rest
tomorrow
morning
not
long
after
sunrise
i
shall
doubtless
come
with
more
precipitation
than
willingness
toward
your
ambuscade
with
a
pack
of
dogs
less
worthy
the
name
than
yourselves
at
my
heels
be
ready
to
help
me
they
are
dogs
and
doubtless
if
you
like
you
will
be
wise
enough
to
make
much
of
this
the
dogs
were
well
pleased
with
his
proposition
and
in
louder
voices
than
was
prudent
attested
their
readiness
to
follow
his
suggestion
going
so
far
as
to
assure
him
that
he
need
have
no
fear
whatsoever
that
they
alone
would
vanquish
the
zuñi
nation
which
they
had
heard
from
other
dogs
was
becoming
rather
lazy
and
indifferent
in
manly
matters
dogs
and
all
the
night
wore
on
the
youth
had
refreshed
himself
with
sleep
and
somewhat
after
the
of
the
had
appeared
he
stealthily
picked
his
way
across
our
broad
plain
toward
the
hill
of
zuñi
and
out
west
there
only
a
short
space
from
the
sunset
front
of
our
town
he
crouched
down
on
a
little
terrace
to
wait
not
long
after
the
had
risen
a
fine
old
zuñi
came
out
of
his
house
shook
his
blanket
wrapped
it
round
him
and
came
stealing
down
in
the
daylight
to
the
river
side
after
he
had
presented
his
morning
sacrifice
toward
the
rising
sun
he
returned
and
sat
down
a
moment
he
had
no
sooner
seated
himself
than
the
wily
sinewy
youth
with
a
quick
motion
sprang
up
pulled
the
poor
man
over
and
with
his
knocked
his
brains
out
after
which
he
leisurely
took
off
the
scalp
of
the
one
he
had
slain
he
had
barely
finished
this
operation
when
he
heard
a
ladder
creak
in
one
of
the
upper
terraces
of
the
town
he
quickly
tucked
the
scalp
in
his
belt
pulled
himself
together
and
thrusting
the
body
of
the
dead
man
into
the
bottom
of
a
hole
which
was
very
near
crouched
over
it
and
waited
the
footsteps
of
the
man
who
was
coming
sounded
nearer
and
nearer
presently
he
also
came
to
this
place
but
no
sooner
had
he
reached
the
terrace
than
the
moki
youth
leaped
up
and
dealt
him
such
a
blow
on
the
head
that
without
uttering
a
sound
he
instantly
expired
this
one
he
likewise
scalped
and
then
another
and
another
he
served
in
the
same
way
until
there
being
four
slain
men
in
the
pit
he
had
to
drag
some
out
of
the
way
and
throw
them
behind
the
just
as
he
returned
another
man
sauntered
down
to
the
place
the
youth
murdered
him
like
the
rest
and
was
busy
skinning
his
scalp
when
another
who
had
followed
him
somewhat
closely
appeared
at
the
hole
and
discovering
what
was
going
on
ran
toward
the
town
for
his
weapons
shouting
the
of
alarm
as
he
went
picking
up
the
scalps
and
snatching
from
the
bodies
of
the
slain
their
ornaments
of
greatest
value
the
moki
youth
sped
off
over
the
plain
in
less
time
than
it
takes
to
tell
it
the
people
of
zuñi
were
in
arms
dogs
barked
children
cried
women
screamed
for
no
one
knew
how
many
the
enemy
might
be
and
the
priests
of
the
bow
in
armor
of
buckskin
and
with
weapons
in
hand
came
thundering
down
the
hill
and
across
the
plains
in
pursuit
of
the
fleeing
youth
and
in
readiness
to
oppose
his
band
long
before
this
crowd
of
warriors
now
fully
awake
and
wild
with
rage
had
reached
the
spot
the
youth
plunged
into
the
arroyo
and
called
out
to
his
dogs
now
for
it
my
friends
they
will
be
here
in
a
minute
do
you
hear
them
coming
oh
ho
softly
barked
the
dogs
and
they
stiffened
their
claws
and
crouched
themselves
to
spring
when
the
time
should
come
presently
on
came
the
crowd
of
warriors
now
feeling
that
they
had
but
a
small
force
if
indeed
more
than
one
man
to
oppose
and
they
came
with
such
precipitation
that
they
took
the
gray
and
dun
and
dogs
for
so
many
rocks
and
heaps
of
sand
and
were
fairly
in
the
midst
of
those
brutes
before
they
became
aware
of
them
at
all
death
and
ashes
what
a
time
there
was
of
it
the
youth
fell
in
with
his
the
dogs
around
behind
and
in
front
of
them
howling
snarling
biting
tearing
and
shaking
the
zuñis
on
every
hand
until
every
one
of
the
band
was
torn
to
pieces
or
so
mangled
that
a
few
taps
of
the
club
of
the
youth
dispatched
them
those
who
had
followed
behind
not
knowing
what
to
think
of
it
all
frantically
ran
back
to
their
people
the
cowards
while
the
youth
with
abundant
leisure
went
on
skinning
scalps
until
perceiving
much
activity
in
the
distant
town
concluded
it
would
be
wise
to
abandon
some
few
he
had
not
finished
so
catching
up
his
pack
of
provisions
and
his
bloody
string
of
scalps
which
was
so
long
and
thick
he
could
hardly
carry
it
and
which
dragged
on
the
ground
behind
him
he
trotted
over
the
hills
followed
by
some
of
the
dogs
the
others
remaining
behind
feeling
more
secure
of
swiftness
to
take
advantage
of
the
ample
feast
spread
before
them
when
the
youth
and
the
dogs
who
followed
him
or
afterward
joined
him
had
again
reached
the
great
spring
by
the
black
mountains
leaving
those
who
pursued
far
behind
they
stopped
and
building
a
fire
of
brush
and
the
youth
cooked
all
the
provisions
he
had
thanks
this
day
my
friends
and
brothers
he
cried
to
the
dogs
ye
have
nobly
served
me
i
will
feast
ye
of
the
whereupon
he
produced
the
and
the
more
delicate
articles
of
food
which
he
had
reserved
as
a
reward
for
the
dogs
they
ate
and
ate
and
loud
were
their
demonstrations
of
satisfaction
then
the
youth
taking
up
the
string
of
scalps
again
attached
them
to
a
long
pole
which
to
keep
the
lower
ones
from
dragging
on
the
ground
he
elevated
over
his
shoulder
and
striking
up
a
song
of
victory
he
wound
his
way
along
the
trail
toward
moki
the
dogs
crazy
with
victory
and
much
glutted
could
not
contain
themselves
but
they
with
delight
and
yelped
and
scurried
about
cutting
circles
dusty
and
wide
around
their
father
the
conquering
youth
they
hurried
on
so
fast
that
it
was
noticeable
that
the
beagle
dogs
fell
in
the
rear
by
the
music
of
marrowbones
exclaimed
some
of
the
swifter
of
foot
we
will
have
to
slacken
our
pace
said
they
addressing
the
youth
our
poor
brothers
the
are
evidently
getting
tired
they
are
falling
far
in
the
rear
and
it
is
not
valorous
however
great
your
victory
and
however
strong
your
desire
to
proclaim
it
at
home
to
leave
a
brother
lagging
behind
the
enemy
might
come
unawares
and
cut
off
his
return
and
his
most
reluctantly
therefore
they
slackened
their
pace
and
with
shouts
and
yelps
encouraged
as
much
as
possible
the
dogs
following
behind
now
on
that
day
in
moki
there
had
been
much
surprise
expressed
at
the
absence
of
the
dogs
except
those
which
were
so
young
or
so
old
that
they
could
not
travel
and
the
people
began
to
think
that
some
devil
or
all
the
wizards
in
mokidom
had
been
conjuring
their
dogs
away
from
them
when
toward
evening
they
heard
a
distant
sound
which
was
the
approaching
victors
demonstration
of
rejoicing
and
clear
above
all
was
the
song
of
victory
shouted
by
the
lusty
youth
as
he
came
bringing
his
scalps
along
woo
woo
woo
the
dogs
sounded
as
they
came
across
the
valley
and
approached
the
foot
of
the
mesa
and
when
the
people
looked
down
and
saw
the
blood
and
dirt
with
which
every
dog
was
covered
they
knew
not
what
to
make
of
it
whether
their
dogs
had
been
enticed
away
and
foully
beaten
or
whether
they
had
taken
after
a
herd
of
antelope
perhaps
and
vanquished
them
but
presently
they
espied
in
the
midst
of
the
motley
crowd
of
curs
the
tall
lank
form
of
the
vagabond
youth
and
heard
his
lusty
song
the
youths
who
had
been
jilted
by
the
maiden
at
once
had
their
own
ideas
some
of
them
sneaked
away
others
ground
their
teeth
and
covered
their
eyes
filled
with
rage
and
shame
while
the
of
the
nation
seeing
what
feats
of
valor
this
neglected
youth
had
accomplished
glorified
him
with
answering
songs
of
victory
and
gathered
in
solemn
council
as
if
for
a
most
honored
and
precious
guest
to
receive
him
so
victorious
and
successful
in
all
ways
the
outcast
dog
of
a
youth
who
went
to
zuñi
and
returned
the
hero
of
the
moki
nation
right
willingly
was
accepted
by
this
beauteous
maiden
as
her
husband
after
the
ceremonies
of
initiation
and
purification
had
been
performed
over
him
ah
well
that
was
very
fine
but
all
this
praise
of
one
who
had
been
despised
and
abused
by
themselves
and
more
than
all
the
possession
of
such
a
beautiful
wife
wrought
fierce
jealousy
in
the
breasts
of
the
many
jilted
lovers
making
those
who
had
looked
askance
at
one
another
before
true
friends
and
firm
brothers
in
a
single
cause
the
undoing
of
this
lucky
vagabond
youth
nor
were
they
alone
in
this
desire
for
behold
copying
their
lucky
sister
all
the
pretty
maidens
in
moki
declared
that
they
would
marry
no
one
who
did
not
show
himself
at
least
in
some
degree
heroic
like
the
youth
of
the
who
had
married
their
pretty
sister
it
therefore
came
about
that
the
whole
tribe
of
moki
so
far
as
the
young
men
were
concerned
became
a
company
of
jilted
lovers
and
all
the
maidens
became
confirmed
in
their
resolutions
of
virgin
maidenhood
the
jilted
lovers
got
together
one
night
in
a
cautious
sort
of
way
for
they
were
all
afraid
of
this
hero
and
held
a
council
but
the
fools
didn
t
think
of
the
dogs
lying
around
outside
who
heard
what
they
said
they
concluded
the
best
way
to
get
even
with
this
youth
was
to
kill
him
but
how
to
kill
him
was
the
problem
for
they
were
cowards
we
will
get
up
a
hunt
said
one
and
make
friends
with
him
and
ask
him
to
go
paying
him
all
sorts
of
attention
and
ask
him
to
instruct
us
in
the
arts
of
war
the
wretch
he
will
readily
join
us
in
our
hunting
excursion
and
some
of
us
will
sling
a
at
him
and
finish
the
conceited
fellow
s
days
now
the
dogs
scrambled
off
immediately
and
informed
their
friend
and
brother
what
was
going
on
he
said
all
right
i
will
accept
their
advances
and
go
with
them
on
the
he
went
off
that
night
to
a
cave
where
he
had
often
sought
shelter
from
the
wind
when
driven
out
of
the
town
of
walpi
and
thus
had
made
acquaintance
with
those
most
unerring
travellers
in
crooked
places
the
he
went
to
one
of
them
an
elderly
wise
bird
and
addressing
him
as
grandfather
told
him
what
was
going
on
very
well
said
the
old
bird
i
will
help
and
he
made
a
boomerang
for
the
youth
which
had
the
power
to
fly
around
bushes
and
down
into
gullies
and
if
well
thrown
of
course
it
could
not
be
dodged
by
any
rabbit
however
swift
of
foot
or
sly
in
hiding
having
finished
this
boomerang
he
told
the
youth
to
take
it
and
use
it
freely
in
hunting
the
youth
thanked
him
and
returning
to
his
town
passed
a
peaceful
night
when
he
appeared
the
next
morning
the
others
greeted
him
pleasantly
those
who
happened
to
see
him
to
which
greetings
he
replied
with
equal
cordiality
they
were
so
importunate
with
the
to
be
allowed
to
undertake
a
grand
that
these
fathers
of
the
people
always
desirous
of
contributing
to
the
happiness
of
their
children
ordered
a
grand
hunt
for
the
very
next
day
so
everybody
was
busy
forthwith
in
making
and
boomerangs
the
next
day
all
the
youth
of
the
town
selecting
the
hero
of
whom
we
have
told
as
their
leader
took
their
way
to
the
great
plain
south
of
moki
and
there
spreading
out
into
an
enormous
circle
they
drove
hundreds
of
rabbits
closer
and
closer
together
among
the
sagebrush
in
the
center
of
the
valley
some
of
them
succeeded
in
striking
down
one
some
of
them
three
or
four
but
ere
long
every
one
observed
that
each
time
the
youth
threw
his
stick
he
struck
a
rabbit
and
secured
it
until
he
had
so
many
that
he
was
forced
to
call
some
boys
who
had
followed
along
to
carry
them
for
him
already
inflamed
by
their
jealousies
to
great
anger
what
was
the
chagrin
of
this
crowd
of
dandies
now
that
this
youth
whom
they
so
heartily
despised
actually
surpassed
them
even
in
hunting
rabbits
they
gnashed
their
teeth
with
rage
and
one
of
them
in
a
moment
of
excitement
when
two
or
three
rabbits
were
trying
to
escape
took
deliberate
aim
at
the
youth
and
threw
his
boomerang
at
him
the
youth
who
was
wily
sprang
into
the
air
so
high
pretending
meanwhile
to
throw
his
boomerang
that
the
missile
missed
his
vital
parts
but
struck
his
leg
and
apparently
broke
it
so
that
he
fell
down
senseless
in
the
midst
of
the
crowd
and
the
people
set
up
a
great
shout
some
of
lamentation
some
of
exultation
let
him
lie
there
and
rot
said
the
angry
suitors
catching
up
their
own
rabbits
and
making
off
for
the
pueblo
but
some
of
the
old
men
who
deplored
this
seeming
accident
of
the
youth
ran
as
fast
as
they
could
toward
the
town
fearing
to
raise
him
lest
they
should
make
his
hurt
worse
for
medicine
when
the
youth
had
been
left
alone
he
opened
his
eyes
and
smiled
then
taking
from
his
pouch
a
medicine
unfailing
in
its
effects
applied
it
to
the
bruised
spot
and
quickly
became
relieved
of
pain
if
not
even
of
injury
rising
he
looked
about
and
found
the
rabbits
where
the
boys
had
dropped
them
and
fled
away
he
made
up
a
huge
bundle
and
not
long
before
sunset
behold
singing
merrily
he
came
marching
though
limping
somewhat
through
the
plain
before
the
of
moki
bearing
an
enormous
burden
of
rabbits
he
climbed
the
mesa
greeted
every
one
pleasantly
as
though
nothing
had
occurred
took
his
way
to
his
home
and
became
admired
of
all
the
women
of
moki
young
and
old
as
a
paragon
of
valor
and
manhood
it
became
absolutely
necessary
after
that
of
course
for
these
dandies
tried
no
more
tricks
with
the
youth
for
anyone
who
would
marry
a
moki
maiden
to
show
himself
a
man
in
some
way
or
other
and
as
the
ugliest
and
most
neglected
of
children
generally
turn
out
sharpest
because
they
have
to
look
out
for
themselves
so
it
happens
that
to
this
day
the
husbands
of
moki
are
generally
very
ugly
but
one
thing
is
certain
they
are
men
reflect
on
these
things
ye
young
ones
and
youths
thus
shortens
my
story
how
the
coyote
joined
the
dance
of
the
you
may
know
the
country
that
lies
south
of
the
valley
in
which
our
town
stands
you
travel
along
the
trail
which
winds
round
the
hill
our
ancients
called
which
means
the
hill
of
grease
for
the
rocks
sometimes
shine
in
the
light
of
the
sun
at
evening
and
it
is
said
that
strange
things
occurred
there
in
the
days
of
the
ancients
which
makes
them
thus
to
shine
while
rocks
of
the
kind
in
other
places
do
not
you
travel
on
up
this
trail
crossing
over
the
arroyos
and
of
the
great
mesa
called
middle
mountain
until
you
come
to
the
foot
of
the
cliffs
then
you
climb
up
back
and
forth
winding
round
and
round
until
you
reach
the
top
of
the
mountain
which
is
as
flat
as
the
floor
of
a
house
merely
being
here
and
there
traversed
by
small
valleys
covered
with
piñon
and
cedar
and
threaded
by
trails
made
not
only
by
the
feet
of
our
people
but
by
deer
and
other
animals
and
so
you
go
on
and
on
until
hardly
knowing
it
you
have
descended
from
the
top
of
middle
mountain
and
found
yourself
in
a
wide
plain
covered
with
grass
and
here
and
there
clumps
of
trees
beyond
this
valley
is
an
elevated
sandy
plain
rather
sunken
in
the
middle
so
that
when
it
rains
the
water
filters
down
into
the
soil
of
the
depressed
portion
which
is
wide
enough
to
be
a
country
in
itself
and
nourishes
the
grasses
there
so
that
most
of
the
year
they
grow
green
and
sweet
now
a
long
long
time
ago
in
this
valley
or
basin
there
lived
a
village
of
on
fairly
peaceable
terms
with
rattlesnakes
adders
chameleons
and
with
the
owls
they
were
especially
friendly
looking
at
them
as
creatures
of
great
gravity
and
sanctity
for
this
reason
these
and
their
companions
never
disturbed
the
councils
or
ceremonies
of
the
but
treated
them
most
respectfully
keeping
at
a
distance
from
them
when
their
dances
were
going
on
it
chanced
one
day
that
the
were
having
a
great
dance
all
to
themselves
rather
early
in
the
morning
the
dance
they
were
engaged
in
was
one
peculiarly
prized
by
them
requiring
no
little
dexterity
in
its
execution
each
dancer
young
man
or
maiden
carried
upon
his
or
her
head
a
bowl
of
foam
and
though
their
legs
were
crooked
and
their
motions
disjointed
they
danced
to
the
whistling
of
some
and
the
clapping
beaks
of
others
in
perfect
unison
and
with
such
dexterity
that
they
never
spilled
a
speck
of
the
foam
on
their
sleek
mantles
of
it
chanced
this
morning
of
the
that
a
coyote
was
nosing
about
for
grasshoppers
and
so
quite
naturally
he
was
prowling
around
the
in
the
borders
of
the
town
his
house
where
he
lived
with
his
old
grandmother
stood
back
to
the
westward
just
over
the
elevations
that
bounded
sunken
country
among
the
rocks
he
heard
the
of
the
musicians
and
their
shrill
funny
little
song
i
yami
hota
utchu
tchapikya
tokos
tokos
tokos
tokos
so
he
pricked
up
his
ears
and
lifting
his
tail
trotted
forward
toward
the
level
place
between
the
hillocks
and
doorways
of
the
village
where
the
owls
were
dancing
in
a
row
he
looked
at
them
with
great
curiosity
squatting
on
his
haunches
the
more
composedly
to
observe
them
indeed
he
became
so
much
interested
and
amused
by
their
shambling
motions
and
clever
evolutions
that
he
could
no
longer
contain
his
curiosity
so
he
stepped
forward
with
a
smirk
and
a
nod
toward
the
old
master
of
ceremonies
and
said
my
father
how
are
you
and
your
children
these
many
days
contented
and
happy
replied
the
old
owl
turning
his
attention
to
the
dancing
again
yes
but
i
observe
you
are
dancing
said
the
coyote
a
very
fine
dance
upon
my
word
charming
charming
and
why
should
you
be
dancing
if
you
were
not
contented
and
happy
to
be
sure
we
are
dancing
responded
the
owl
both
for
our
pleasure
and
for
the
good
of
the
true
true
replied
the
coyote
but
what
s
that
which
looks
like
foam
these
dancers
are
carrying
on
their
heads
and
why
do
they
dance
in
so
limping
a
fashion
you
see
my
friend
said
the
owl
turning
toward
the
coyote
we
hold
this
to
be
a
very
sacred
performance
very
sacred
indeed
being
such
these
my
children
are
initiated
and
so
trained
in
the
mysteries
of
the
sacred
society
of
which
this
is
a
custom
that
they
can
do
very
strange
things
in
the
observance
of
our
ceremonies
you
ask
what
it
is
that
looks
like
foam
they
are
balancing
on
their
heads
look
more
closely
friend
do
you
not
observe
that
it
is
their
own
grandmothers
heads
they
have
on
the
feathers
turned
white
with
age
by
my
eyes
exclaimed
the
coyote
blinking
and
twitching
his
whiskers
it
seems
and
you
ask
also
why
they
limp
as
they
dance
said
the
owl
now
this
limp
is
essential
to
the
proper
performance
of
our
dance
so
essential
in
fact
that
in
order
to
attain
to
it
these
my
children
go
through
the
pain
of
having
their
legs
broken
instead
of
losing
by
this
they
gain
in
a
great
many
ways
good
luck
always
follows
them
they
are
quite
as
spry
as
they
were
before
and
enjoy
moreover
the
distinction
of
performing
a
dance
which
no
other
people
or
creatures
in
the
world
are
capable
of
dust
and
devils
ejaculated
the
coyote
this
is
passing
strange
a
most
admirable
dance
upon
my
word
why
every
bristle
on
my
body
keeps
time
to
the
music
and
their
steps
look
here
my
friend
don
t
you
think
that
i
could
learn
that
dance
well
replied
the
old
owl
it
is
rather
hard
to
learn
and
you
haven
t
been
initiated
you
know
but
still
if
you
are
determined
that
you
would
like
to
join
the
dance
by
the
way
have
you
a
grandmother
yes
and
a
fine
old
woman
she
is
said
he
twitching
his
mouth
in
the
direction
of
his
house
she
lives
there
with
me
i
dare
say
she
is
looking
after
my
breakfast
very
well
continued
the
old
owl
if
you
care
to
join
in
our
dance
fulfill
the
conditions
and
i
think
we
can
receive
you
into
our
and
he
added
aside
the
silly
fool
the
sneaking
impertinent
wretch
i
will
teach
him
to
be
sticking
that
sharp
nose
of
his
into
other
people
s
affairs
all
right
all
right
cried
the
coyote
excitedly
will
it
last
long
until
the
sun
is
so
bright
that
it
hurts
our
eyes
said
the
owl
a
long
time
all
right
all
right
i
ll
be
back
in
a
little
while
said
the
coyote
and
switching
his
tail
into
the
air
away
he
ran
toward
his
home
when
he
came
to
the
house
he
saw
his
old
grandmother
on
the
roof
which
was
a
rock
beside
his
hole
gathering
fur
from
some
skins
which
he
had
brought
home
to
make
up
a
bed
for
the
coyote
s
family
ha
my
blessed
grandmother
said
the
coyote
by
means
of
your
aid
what
a
fine
thing
i
shall
be
able
to
do
the
old
woman
was
singing
to
herself
when
the
coyote
dashed
up
to
the
roof
where
she
was
sitting
and
catching
up
a
convenient
whacked
her
over
the
pate
and
sawed
her
head
off
with
the
teeth
of
a
deer
all
bloody
and
soft
as
it
was
he
clapped
it
on
his
own
head
and
raised
himself
on
his
hindlegs
bracing
his
tail
against
the
ground
and
letting
his
paws
drop
with
the
toes
outspread
to
imitate
as
nearly
as
possible
the
drooping
wings
of
the
dancing
owls
he
found
that
it
worked
very
well
so
descending
with
the
head
in
one
paw
and
a
stone
in
the
other
he
found
a
convenient
rock
and
laying
his
legs
across
it
hit
them
a
tremendous
crack
with
the
stone
which
broke
them
to
be
sure
into
splinters
beloved
powers
oh
howled
the
coyote
the
dance
may
be
a
fine
thing
but
the
initiation
is
anything
else
however
with
his
faith
unabated
he
shook
himself
together
and
got
up
to
walk
but
he
could
walk
only
with
his
paws
his
hindlegs
dragged
helplessly
behind
him
nevertheless
with
great
pain
and
getting
weaker
and
weaker
every
step
of
the
way
he
made
what
haste
he
could
back
to
the
town
his
poor
old
grandmother
s
head
slung
over
his
shoulders
when
he
approached
the
dancers
for
they
were
still
dancing
they
pretended
to
be
greatly
delighted
with
their
proselyte
and
greeted
him
notwithstanding
his
rueful
countenance
with
many
congratulatory
epithets
mingled
with
very
proper
and
warm
expressions
of
welcome
the
coyote
looked
sick
and
groaned
occasionally
and
kept
looking
around
at
his
feet
as
though
he
would
like
to
lick
them
but
the
old
owl
extended
his
wing
and
cautioned
him
not
to
interfere
with
the
working
power
of
faith
in
this
essential
observance
and
invited
him
with
a
that
very
much
resembled
a
suppressed
giggle
to
join
in
their
dance
the
coyote
smirked
and
bowed
and
tried
to
stand
up
gracefully
on
his
stumps
but
fell
over
his
grandmother
s
head
rolling
around
in
the
dirt
he
picked
up
the
grisly
head
clapped
it
on
his
crown
again
and
raised
himself
and
with
many
a
howl
which
he
tried
in
vain
to
check
began
to
prance
around
but
ere
long
tumbled
over
again
the
were
filled
with
such
merriment
at
his
discomfiture
that
they
laughed
until
they
spilled
the
foam
all
down
their
backs
and
bosoms
and
with
a
parting
fling
at
the
coyote
which
gave
him
to
understand
that
he
had
made
a
fine
fool
of
himself
and
would
know
better
than
to
pry
into
other
people
s
business
next
time
skipped
away
to
a
safe
distance
from
him
then
seeing
how
he
had
been
tricked
the
coyote
fell
to
howling
and
clapping
his
thighs
and
catching
sight
of
his
poor
grandmother
s
head
all
bloody
and
begrimed
with
dirt
he
cried
out
in
grief
and
anger
alas
alas
that
it
should
have
come
to
this
you
little
devils
i
ll
be
even
with
you
i
ll
smoke
you
out
of
your
what
will
you
smoke

with
tauntingly
asked
the
ha

find
out
with
yucca
o
o
ha
ha
laughed
the
owls
that
is
our
succotash
ah
well

ll

yelled
the
coyote
stung
by
their
taunts
what
with
cried
the
owls
he
ha
ho

make
our
of
that
ha
but
i
ll

nevertheless

the
owls

said
he

our
sweet
gruel

fool
i
ll
fix
you
i
ll
smoke
you
out
i
ll
suffocate
the
very
last
one
of
you
what
with
what
with
shouted
the
owls
skipping
around
on
their
crooked
feet
snarled
the
coyote
this
frightened
the
owls
for
even
to
this
day
is
sickening
to
them
away
they
plunged
into
their
holes
then
the
coyote
looked
at
his
poor
old
grandmother
s
begrimed
and
bloody
head
and
cried
out
just
as
coyotes
do
now
at
sunset
i
suppose
oh
my
poor
poor
grandmother
so
this
is
what
they
have
caused
me
to
do
to
you
and
tormented
both
by
his
grief
and
his
pain
he
took
up
the
head
of
his
grandmother
and
crawled
back
as
best
he
could
to
his
house
when
he
arrived
there
he
managed
to
climb
up
to
the
roof
where
her
body
lay
stiff
he
chafed
her
legs
and
sides
and
washed
the
blood
and
dirt
from
her
head
and
got
a
bit
of
sinew
and
sewed
her
head
to
her
body
as
carefully
as
he
could
and
as
hastily
then
he
opened
her
mouth
and
putting
his
muzzle
to
it
blew
into
her
throat
in
the
hope
of
resuscitating
her
but
the
wind
only
leaked
out
from
the
holes
in
her
neck
and
she
gave
no
signs
of
animation
then
the
coyote
mixed
some
pap
of
fine
toasted
meal
and
water
and
poured
it
down
her
throat
addressing
her
with
vehement
expressions
of
regret
at
what
he
had
done
and
apology
and
solicitation
that
she
should
not
mind
as
he
didn
t
mean
it
and
imploring
her
to
revive
but
the
pap
only
trickled
out
between
the
stitches
in
her
neck
and
she
grew
colder
and
stiffer
all
the
while
so
that
at
last
the
coyote
gave
it
up
and
moaning
he
betook
himself
to
a
near
clump
of
piñon
trees
intent
upon
vengeance
and
designing
to
gather
pitch
with
which
to
smoke
the
owls
to
death
but
weakened
by
his
injuries
and
filled
with
grief
and
shame
and
mortification
when
he
got
there
he
could
only
lie
down
he
was
so
engrossed
in
howling
and
thinking
of
his
woes
and
pains
that
a
who
saw
him
and
who
hated
him
because
of
the
insults
he
had
frequently
suffered
from
him
and
his
kind
crawled
into
the
throat
of
the
beast
without
his
noticing
it
presently
the
little
creature
struck
up
a
song
tsakina
iyami
kushina
tsoiyakya
aisiwaiki
muki
muki
muuu
ka
the
coyote
was
groaning
but
when
he
heard
this
song
apparently
far
off
and
yet
so
near
he
felt
very
strangely
inside
so
he
thought
and
no
doubt
wondered
if
it
were
the
song
of
some
musician
at
any
rate
he
lifted
his
head
and
looked
all
around
but
hearing
nothing
lay
down
again
and
bemoaned
his
fate
then
the
sang
again
this
time
the
coyote
called
out
immediately
and
the
answered
here
i
but
look
as
he
would
the
coyote
could
not
find
the
toad
so
he
listened
for
the
song
again
and
heard
it
and
asked
who
it
was
that
was
singing
the
replied
that
it
was
he
but
still
the
coyote
could
not
find
him
a
fourth
time
the
sang
and
the
coyote
began
to
suspect
that
it
was
under
him
so
he
lifted
himself
to
see
and
one
of
the
spines
on
the
s
neck
pricked
him
and
at
the
same
time
the
little
fellow
called
out
here
i
am
you
idiot
inside
of
you
i
came
upon
you
here
and
being
a
of
some
prominence
i
thought
i
would
explore
your
vitals
and
see
what
was
the
by
the
souls
of
my
ancestors
exclaimed
the
coyote
be
careful
what
you
do
in
there
the
replied
by
laying
his
hand
on
the
coyote
s
liver
and
exclaiming
what
is
this
i
feel
where
said
the
coyote
down
merciful
daylight
it
is
my
liver
without
which
no
one
can
have
solidity
of
any
kind
or
a
proper
vitality
be
very
careful
not
to
injure
that
if
you
do
i
shall
die
at
once
and
what
will
become
of
my
poor
wife
and
children
then
the
climbed
up
to
the
stomach
of
the
coyote
what
is
this
my
friend
said
he
feeling
the
sides
of
the
coyote
s
what
is
it
like
asked
the
coyote
wrinkled
said
the
and
filled
with
a
fearful
mess
of
stuff
oh
mercy
mercy
good
daylight
my
precious
friend
be
very
careful
that
is
the
very
source
of
my
being
my
stomach
itself
very
well
said
the
then
he
moved
on
somewhat
farther
and
touched
the
heart
of
the
coyote
which
startled
him
fearfully
what
is
this
cried
the
mercy
mercy
what
are
you
doing
exclaimed
the
coyote
nothing
feeling
of
your
vitals
was
the
reply
what
is
it
oh
what
is
it
like
said
the
coyote
shaped
like
a
said
the
as
nearly
as
i
can
make
out
it
keeps
leaping
leaping
is
it
howled
the
coyote
mercy
my
friend
get
away
from
there
that
is
the
very
heart
of
my
being
the
thread
that
ties
my
existence
the
home
of
my
emotions
and
my
knowledge
of
daylight
go
away
from
there
do
i
pray
you
if
you
should
scratch
it
ever
so
little
it
would
be
the
death
of
me
and
what
would
my
wife
and
children
do
hey
said
the
you
wouldn
t
be
apt
to
insult
me
and
my
people
any
more
if
i
touched
you
up
there
a
little
would
you
and
he
hooked
one
of
his
horns
into
the
coyote
s
heart
the
coyote
gave
one
gasp
straightened
out
his
limbs
and
expired
ha
ha
you
villain
thus
would
you
have
done
to
me
had
you
found
the
chance
thus
unto
you
saying
which
he
found
his
way
out
and
sought
the
nearest
he
could
find
so
you
see
from
this
which
took
place
in
the
days
of
the
ancients
it
may
be
inferred
that
the
instinct
of
meddling
with
everything
that
did
not
concern
him
and
making
a
universal
nuisance
of
himself
and
desiring
to
imitate
everything
that
he
sees
ready
to
jump
into
any
trap
that
is
laid
for
him
is
a
confirmed
instinct
with
the
coyote
for
those
are
precisely
his
characteristics
today
furthermore
coyotes
never
insult
nowadays
and
they
keep
clear
of
and
ever
since
then
the
have
been
speckled
with
gray
and
white
all
over
their
backs
and
bosoms
because
their
ancestors
spilled
foam
over
themselves
in
laughing
at
the
silliness
of
the
coyote
thus
shortens
my
story
the
coyote
who
killed
the
demon
síuiuki
or
why
coyotes
run
their
noses
into
deadfalls
it
was
very
long
ago
in
the
days
of
the
ancients
there
stood
a
village
in
the
cañon
south
of
thunder
mountain
where
the
gods
of
prey
all
lived
with
their
sisters
and
mothers
the
mountain
lion
the
great
black
bear
the
wildcat
the
gray
wolf
the
eagle
and
even
the
mole
all
the
gods
of
prey
lived
there
together
with
their
mothers
and
sisters
day
after
day
they
went
out
hunting
for
hunting
was
their
business
of
life
and
they
were
great
hunters
now
right
up
on
the
edge
of
thunder
mountain
there
lived
a
spotted
demon
named
síuiuki
and
whenever
the
people
of
the
towns
round
about
went
hunting
he
lay
in
wait
for
them
and
ate
them
up
after
a
long
while
the
gods
of
prey
grew
discontented
and
they
said
to
one
another
what
in
the
world
can
we
do
none
of
the
children
of
men
ever
make
sacrifices
to
us
for
whenever
our
children
among
men
go
out
hunting
this
demon
who
lives
on
the
top
of
thunder
mountain
destroys
them
and
eats
them
up
what
in
the
world
can
be
done
it
would
be
a
good
thing
if
we
could
kill
him
said
some
of
them
now
just
down
below
the
house
of
the
demon
in
wolf
cañon
lived
a
coyote
and
he
had
found
out
where
the
gods
of
prey
lived
and
whenever
he
wanted
a
feast
of
sinew
and
gristle
he
went
below
their
houses
and
gnawed
at
the
bones
that
they
had
thrown
away
and
thus
it
happened
that
when
the
gods
were
talking
together
in
this
way
he
was
near
their
doorway
gnawing
a
bone
and
he
heard
all
they
said
yes
said
one
or
two
of
the
others
and
if
anybody
will
go
and
kill
síuiuki
we
will
give
him
our
sister
to
aha
said
the
coyote
to
himself
ha
ha
and
he
dropped
the
bone
he
was
gnawing
and
cut
off
for
home
as
fast
as
ever
he
could
next
morning
bright
and
early
he
began
to
dig
into
the
side
of
the
cañon
below
the
demon
s
home
and
after
he
had
dug
a
great
hollow
in
the
side
of
the
arroyo
he
rolled
a
heavy
stone
into
it
and
found
another
which
he
placed
beside
it
then
he
brought
a
great
many
of
deer
and
antelope
then
he
found
a
large
bowl
and
put
a
lot
of
yellow
in
it
and
placed
it
beside
the
rock
he
then
sat
down
and
began
to
crack
the
with
the
two
stones
he
had
brought
there
the
old
demon
was
not
in
the
habit
of
rising
very
early
but
when
he
arose
that
morning
he
came
out
and
sat
down
on
the
edge
of
the
cliff
there
the
coyote
was
battering
away
at
the
bones
and
pretending
to
bathe
his
own
lips
with
the
i
wonder
what
in
the
world
that
little
sneak
is
doing
down
there
said
the
old
demon
so
he
put
on
his
and
took
his
bow
and
arrows
as
though
he
were
going
out
to
hunt
and
started
down
to
where
the
coyote
was
hello
said
the
coyote
how
did
you
pass
the
night
what
in
the
world
are
you
doing
here
asked
the
demon
why
don
t
you
know
replied
the
coyote
this
is
the
way
i
train
myself
for
running
so
as
to
catch
the
deer
i
can
run
faster
than
any
deer
in
the
country
with
my
medicine
here
i
take
the
swiftness
out
of
these
is
it
possible
said
the
old
demon
of
course
it
is
said
the
coyote
there
is
no
deer
that
can
run
away
from
will
you
show
me
said
the
demon
eagerly
why
yes
of
course
i
will
and
then
we
will
go
hunting
good
good
said
the
old
demon
i
have
a
hard
time
catching
deer
and
well
now
you
sit
down
right
over
there
and
watch
me
said
the
coyote
and
i
will
show
you
all
about
so
he
laid
his
left
leg
over
the
rock
and
then
slily
took
an
antelope
bone
and
laid
it
by
the
side
of
it
then
he
picked
up
a
large
stone
and
struck
it
as
hard
as
ever
he
could
against
the
bone
whack
went
the
stone
and
it
split
the
bone
into
splinters
and
the
coyote
pretended
that
it
was
the
bone
of
his
own
leg
aye
ah
oh
exclaimed
he
but
then
it
will
get
well
still
crying
oh
ah
he
splashed
the
leg
with
the
and
rubbed
it
didn
t
i
tell
you
said
he
it
is
all
right
and
then
away
he
went
and
ran
like
lightning
round
and
round
on
the
plain
below
and
rushed
back
again
didn
t
i
tell
you
so
said
he
fury
what
a
runner
it
makes
out
of
you
said
the
old
demon
and
his
eyes
stuck
out
more
than
ever
let
me
try
it
hold
on
hold
on
said
the
coyote
i
have
not
half
finished
so
he
repeated
the
experiment
with
his
other
leg
and
made
great
ado
as
if
it
hurt
him
more
than
ever
but
pretending
to
cure
himself
with
the
he
ran
round
and
round
on
the
plain
below
so
fast
that
he
fairly
left
a
streak
of
dust
behind
him
why
indeed
you
are
one
of
the
fastest
runners
i
ever
saw
said
the
demon
rubbing
his
eyes
then
the
coyote
repeated
the
experiment
first
with
his
left
paw
and
then
with
his
right
and
the
last
time
he
ran
more
swiftly
than
before
why
do
you
mean
to
say
that
if
i
do
that
i
can
run
as
fast
as
you
do
said
the
demon
certainly
replied
the
coyote
but
it
will
hurt
ho
who
cares
for
a
little
hurt
said
the
demon
oh
but
it
hurts
terribly
said
the
coyote
and
i
am
afraid
you
won
t
have
the
pluck
to
go
through
with
do
you
think
i
am
a
baby
said
the
old
demon
getting
up
or
a
woman
that
i
should
be
afraid
to
pound
my
legs
and
arms
well
i
only
thought
i
d
tell
you
how
much
it
hurts
said
the
coyote
but
if
you
want
to
try
it
yourself
why
go
ahead
there
s
one
thing
certain
when
you
make
yourself
as
swift
as
i
am
there
s
no
deer
in
all
the
country
that
can
get
away
from
us
what
shall
i
do
said
the
demon
you
just
sit
right
down
there
and
i
ll
show
you
how
said
the
coyote
so
the
demon
sat
down
by
the
rock
there
now
you
just
lay
your
leg
right
over
that
stone
and
take
the
other
rock
and
strike
your
leg
just
as
hard
as
you
can
and
as
soon
as
you
have
done
bathe
it
in
the
then
do
just
the
same
way
to
the
all
right
said
the
demon
so
he
laid
his
leg
over
the
rock
and
picking
up
the
other
stone
brought
it
down
with
might
and
main
across
his
thigh
so
hard
indeed
that
he
crushed
the
bone
into
splinters
oh
my
oh
my
what
shall
i
do
shouted
the
demon
be
patient
be
patient
it
will
get
well
said
the
coyote
and
he
splashed
it
with
the
then
picking
up
the
stone
again
the
demon
hit
the
other
thigh
even
harder
from
pain
it
will
get
well
my
friend
it
will
get
well
shouted
the
coyote
and
he
splashed
more
of
the
on
the
two
wounded
legs
then
the
demon
picked
up
the
stone
once
more
and
laying
his
left
arm
across
the
other
stone
pounded
that
also
until
it
was
broken
hold
on
let
me
bathe
it
for
you
said
the
coyote
does
it
hurt
oh
well
it
will
get
well
just
wait
until
you
have
doctored
the
other
arm
and
then
in
a
few
minutes
you
will
be
all
oh
dear
oh
dear
groaned
the
demon
how
in
the
world
can
i
doctor
the
other
arm
for
my
left
arm
is
broken
lay
it
across
the
rock
my
friend
said
the
coyote
and
i
ll
doctor
it
for
so
the
demon
did
as
he
was
bidden
and
the
coyote
brought
the
stone
down
with
might
and
main
against
his
arm
have
patience
my
friend
have
patience
said
he
as
he
bathed
the
injured
limb
with
more
of
the
but
the
demon
only
groaned
and
howled
and
rolled
over
and
over
in
the
dust
with
pain
ha
ha
laughed
the
coyote
as
he
keeled
a
somersault
over
the
rocks
and
ran
off
over
the
plain
how
do
you
feel
now
old
man
but
it
hurts
it
hurts
cried
the
demon
i
shall
never
get
well
it
will
kill
me
of
course
it
will
laughed
the
coyote
that
s
just
what
i
wanted
it
to
do
you
old
fool
so
the
old
demon
lay
down
and
died
from
sheer
pain
then
the
coyote
took
the
demon
s
knife
from
him
and
cutting
open
his
breast
tore
out
his
heart
and
all
then
stealing
the
that
the
demon
had
worn
he
cut
away
as
fast
as
ever
he
could
for
the
home
of
the
before
noon
he
neared
their
house
and
just
as
he
ran
up
into
the
plaza
in
front
of
it
the
youngest
sister
of
the
came
out
to
hang
up
some
meat
to
dry
now
her
brothers
had
all
gone
hunting
not
one
of
them
was
at
home
i
say

said
the
coyote
wife

humph
said
the
girl
impertinent
scoundrel
i
wonder
where
he
is
and
who
he
is
that
has
the
impudence
to
call
me

wife
when
he
knows
that
i
have
never
been
married
wife
wife
shouted
the
coyote
again
away
with
you
you
shameless
rascal
cried
the
girl
in
indignation
then
she
looked
around
and
spied
the
coyote
sitting
there
on
the
with
his
nose
in
the
air
as
though
he
were
the
biggest
fellow
in
the
world
clear
out
you
wretch
cried
the
girl
softly
softly
replied
the
coyote
do
you
remember
what
your
brothers
said
last
night
what
was
that
said
the
girl
why
whoever
would
kill
the
speckled
demon
they
declared
should
have
you
for
his
well
what
of
that
said
the
girl
oh
nothing
replied
the
coyote
only
i
ve
killed
him
and
holding
up
the
demon
s
heart
and
he
stuck
his
nose
in
the
air
again
so
the
poor
girl
said
not
a
word
but
sat
there
until
the
coyote
called
out
i
say
wife
come
down
and
take
me
up
i
can
t
climb
the
so
the
poor
girl
went
down
the
ladder
took
her
husband
in
her
arms
and
climbed
up
with
him
now
take
me
in
with
you
said
the
coyote
so
she
did
as
she
was
bidden
then
she
was
about
to
mix
some
dough
but
the
coyote
kept
getting
in
her
way
get
out
of
the
way
a
minute
won
t
you
said
the
girl
until
i
cook
something
for
i
want
you
to
come
and
sit
down
with
me
said
the
coyote
and
let
me
kiss
you
for
you
know
you
are
my
wife
so
the
poor
girl
had
to
submit
to
the
creature
s
embraces
presently
along
came
her
brother
the
gray
wolf
but
he
was
a
very
sort
of
fellow
so
he
received
the
coyote
pleasantly
then
along
came
the
bear
with
a
big
antelope
over
his
shoulder
but
he
didn
t
say
anything
for
he
was
a
lazy
fellow
then
presently
the
other
brothers
came
in
one
by
one
but
the
mountain
lion
was
so
late
in
returning
that
they
began
to
look
anxiously
out
for
him
when
they
saw
him
coming
from
the
north
with
more
meat
and
more
game
than
all
the
others
together
had
brought
he
was
evidently
not
in
good
humor
for
as
he
approached
the
house
he
exclaimed
with
a
howl
there
he
goes
again
said
the
brothers
and
sisters
all
in
a
chorus
always
out
of
temper
with
exclaimed
the
mountain
lion
again
louder
than
before
and
as
he
mounted
the
ladder
he
exclaimed
for
a
third
time
and
throwing
his
meat
down
entered
swearing
and
growling
until
his
brothers
were
ashamed
of
him
and
told
him
he
had
better
behave
himself
come
and
eat
said
the
sister
as
she
brought
a
bowl
of
meat
and
put
it
on
the
floor
again
exclaimed
the
mountain
lion
as
he
came
nearer
and
sat
down
to
eat
what
in
the
world
is
the
matter
with
you
sister
you
smell
just
like
a
coyote
have
you
no
more
decency
than
to
come
home
and
scold
your
sister
in
that
way
exclaimed
the
wolf
i
m
disgusted
with
reiterated
the
mountain
lion
now
when
the
coyote
had
heard
the
mountain
lion
coming
he
had
sneaked
off
into
a
corner
but
he
stuck
his
sharp
nose
out
and
the
mountain
lion
espied
it
said
he
sling
that
beast
out
of
the
house
kick
him
out
cried
the
old
man
with
a
growl
so
the
sister
fearing
that
her
brother
would
eat
her
husband
up
took
the
coyote
in
her
arms
and
carried
him
into
another
room
now
stay
there
and
keep
still
for
brother
is
very
cross
but
then
he
is
always
cross
if
things
don
t
go
right
she
said
so
when
evening
came
her
brothers
began
to
discuss
where
they
would
go
hunting
the
next
day
and
the
coyote
who
was
listening
at
the
door
heard
them
so
he
called
out
wife
wife
remarked
old
long
tail
shut
up
you
dirty
and
as
the
sister
arose
to
go
to
see
what
her
husband
wanted
the
mountain
lion
remarked
you
had
better
sling
that
cub
of
yours
over
the
no
sooner
had
the
girl
entered
than
the
coyote
began
to
brag
what
a
runner
he
was
and
to
cut
around
at
a
great
rate
exclaimed
the
mountain
lion
again
a
coyote
always
will
make
a
coyote
of
himself
wretch
shut
up
and
behave
yourself
cried
the
wolf
don
t
you
know
any
better
than
to
talk
about
your
in
that
way
but
neither
the
coyote
nor
the
girl
could
sleep
that
night
for
the
growlings
and
roarings
of
their
big
brother
the
long
tail
when
the
brothers
began
to
prepare
for
the
hunt
the
next
morning
out
came
the
coyote
all
ready
to
accompany
them
you
you
said
the
mountain
lion
you
going
to
hunt
with
us
you
conceited
sneak
let
him
go
if
he
wants
to
said
the
wolf
fine
company
remarked
the
mountain
lion
if
you
fellows
want
to
walk
with
him
you
may
there
s
one
thing
certain
i
ll
not
be
seen
in
his
company
and
away
strode
the
old
fellow
lashing
his
tail
and
growling
as
he
went
so
the
coyote
taking
a
luncheon
of
dried
meat
that
his
wife
put
up
for
him
sneaked
along
behind
with
his
tail
dragging
in
the
dust
finally
they
all
reached
the
mountain
where
they
intended
to
hunt
and
soon
the
mountain
lion
and
the
bear
started
out
to
drive
in
a
herd
of
antelope
that
they
had
scented
in
the
distance
presently
along
rushed
the
leaders
of
the
herd
now
then
i
ll
show
your
cross
old
brother
whether
i
can
hunt
or
not
cried
the
coyote
and
away
he
rushed
right
into
the
herd
of
antelope
and
deer
before
anyone
could
restrain
him
of
course
he
made
a
coyote
of
himself
and
away
went
the
deer
in
all
directions
nevertheless
the
brothers
who
were
great
hunters
succeeded
in
catching
a
few
of
them
and
just
as
they
sat
down
to
lunch
the
mountain
lion
returned
with
a
big
elk
on
his
shoulders
where
is
our
he
asked
nobody
knows
replied
they
he
rushed
off
after
the
deer
and
antelope
and
that
was
the
last
of
of
course
the
beast
will
make
a
coyote
of
himself
but
he
can
go
till
he
can
go
no
longer
for
all
i
care
added
the
mountain
lion
as
he
sat
down
to
eat
presently
along
came
the
coyote
where
s
your
game
my
fine
hunter
asked
the
mountain
lion
they
all
got
away
from
me
whined
the
coyote
of
course
they
did
you
fool
sneered
the
mountain
lion
the
best
thing
that
you
can
do
is
to
go
home
and
see
your
wife
here
take
this
meat
to
sister
said
he
slinging
him
a
haunch
of
venison
where
s
the
road
asked
the
coyote
well
said
the
wolf
follow
that
path
right
over
there
until
you
come
to
where
it
forks
then
be
sure
to
take
the
trail
for
if
you
follow
the
trail
it
will
lead
you
away
from
home
and
into
which
trail
did
you
say
cried
the
coyote
again
exclaimed
the
mountain
lion
oh
yes
hastily
added
the
coyote
the
trail
no
the
just
what
you
might
expect
growled
the
mountain
lion
already
the
fool
has
forgotten
what
you
told
him
well
as
for
me
he
can
go
on
the
trail
if
he
wants
to
and
the
farther
he
goes
the
now
be
sure
and
take
the
trail
called
the
wolf
as
the
coyote
started
i
know
i
know
cried
the
coyote
and
away
he
went
with
his
heavy
haunch
of
venison
slung
over
his
shoulder
after
a
while
he
came
to
the
fork
in
the
trail
let
me
see
said
he
it
s
the
trail
it
seems
to
me
no
the
trail
well
i
declare
i
ve
forgotten
perhaps
it
is
the
trail
and
maybe
it
is
the
trail
yes
it
is
the
trail
now
i
m
and
picking
up
his
haunch
of
venison
away
he
trotted
along
the
trail
presently
he
came
to
a
steep
cliff
and
began
to
climb
it
but
he
had
no
sooner
reached
the
middle
than
a
lot
of
began
to
fly
around
his
head
and
pick
at
his
eyes
and
slap
him
on
the
nose
with
their
wings
oh
dear
oh
dear
exclaimed
the
coyote
aye
aye
and
he
bobbed
his
head
from
side
to
side
to
dodge
the
swallows
until
he
missed
his
footing
and
down
he
tumbled
heels
over
head
meat
coyote
and
all
until
he
struck
a
great
pile
of
rocks
below
and
was
dashed
to
pieces
that
was
the
end
of
the
coyote
but
not
of
my
story
now
the
brothers
went
on
hunting
again
then
one
by
one
they
returned
home
as
before
the
mountain
lion
came
in
last
of
all
he
smelt
all
about
the
room
whew
exclaimed
he
it
still
smells
here
as
if
twenty
coyotes
had
been
around
but
it
seems
to
me
that
our
fine
isn
t
anywhere
no
responded
the
rest
with
troubled
looks
on
their
faces
nobody
has
seen
anything
of
him
remarked
the
mountain
lion
again
didn
t
i
tell
you
brothers
that
he
was
a
fool
and
would
forget
your
directions
i
say
i
told
you
that
before
he
started
well
for
my
part
i
hope
the
beast
has
gone
so
far
that
he
will
never
return
and
with
that
he
ate
his
supper
when
supper
was
over
the
sister
said
come
brothers
let
s
go
and
hunt
for
my
at
first
the
mountain
lion
growled
and
swore
a
great
deal
but
at
last
he
consented
to
go
when
they
came
to
where
the
trails
forked
there
were
the
tracks
of
the
coyote
on
the
trail
the
idiot
exclaimed
the
mountain
lion
i
hope
he
has
fallen
off
the
cliff
and
broken
every
bone
in
his
body
when
at
last
the
party
reached
the
mountain
sure
enough
there
lay
the
body
of
the
coyote
with
not
a
whole
bone
in
him
except
his
head
good
enough
for
you
growled
the
mountain
lion
as
he
picked
up
a
great
stone
and
threw
it
down
with
all
his
strength
upon
the
head
of
the
coyote
that
s
what
happened
a
great
while
ago
and
for
that
reason
whenever
a
coyote
sees
a
bait
of
meat
inside
of
a
stone
deadfall
he
is
sure
to
stick
his
nose
in
and
get
his
head
mashed
for
his
pains
thus
shortens
my
story
illustration
a
dance
of
the
kâkâ
photo
by
vroman
how
the
coyotes
tried
to
steal
the
children
of
the
sacred
dance
in
the
times
of
the
ancients
when
our
people
lived
in
various
places
about
the
valley
of
zuñi
where
ruins
now
stand
it
is
said
that
an
old
coyote
lived
in
cedar
cañon
with
his
family
which
included
a
fine
litter
of
pups
it
is
also
said
that
at
this
time
there
lived
on
the
crest
of
thunder
mountain
back
of
the
broad
rock
column
or
pinnacle
which
guards
its
western
portion
one
of
the
gods
of
the
sacred
drama
dance
named
k
yámakwe
with
his
children
many
in
number
and
altogether
like
himself
the
or
sacred
drama
dance
is
represented
by
a
great
variety
of
masks
and
costumes
worn
by
zuñi
dancers
during
the
performance
of
this
remarkable
dramatic
ceremony
undoubtedly
many
of
the
traditional
characters
of
the
sacred
drama
thus
represented
are
conventionalizations
of
the
mythic
conceptions
or
personifications
of
animal
attributes
therefore
many
of
these
characters
partake
at
once
of
the
characteristics
in
appearance
as
well
as
in
other
ways
of
animals
and
men
the
example
in
point
is
a
good
illustration
of
this
the
k
yámakwe
are
supposed
to
have
been
a
most
wonderful
and
powerful
tribe
of
inhabiting
a
great
valley
and
range
of
mesas
some
forty
miles
south
of
zuñi
their
powers
over
the
atmospheric
phenomena
of
nature
and
over
all
the
herbivorous
animals
are
supposed
to
have
been
absolute
their
attitude
toward
man
was
at
times
inimical
at
times
friendly
or
beneficent
such
a
relationship
controlled
simply
by
either
laudatory
or
propitiatory
worship
was
supposed
to
hold
spiritually
still
between
these
and
other
beings
represented
in
the
sacred
drama
and
men
it
is
believed
that
through
the
power
of
breath
communicated
by
these
ancient
gods
to
men
from
one
man
to
another
man
and
thus
from
generation
to
generation
an
actual
connection
has
been
kept
up
between
initiated
members
of
the
drama
and
these
original
characters
which
it
represents
so
that
when
a
member
is
properly
dressed
in
the
costume
of
any
one
of
these
characters
a
ceremony
the
description
of
which
is
too
long
for
insertion
here
accompanying
the
putting
on
of
the
mask
is
supposed
not
only
to
place
him
spiritually
with
the
character
he
represents
but
even
to
possess
him
with
the
spirit
of
that
character
or
he
is
therefore
so
long
as
he
remains
disguised
as
one
of
these
treated
as
if
he
were
actually
that
being
which
he
personates
one
of
the
k
yámakwe
is
represented
by
means
of
a
mask
round
and
with
little
black
eyes
turned
up
at
the
corners
so
as
to
represent
a
segment
of
a
diminishing
spiral
the
color
of
the
face
is
green
and
it
is
separated
from
the
rest
of
the
head
by
a
line
composed
of
alternate
blocks
of
black
and
yellow
the
crown
and
back
of
the
head
are
and
the
ears
are
pendent
and
conical
in
shape
being
composed
of
husks
or
other
material
the
mouth
is
round
and
furnished
with
a
beak
of
husks
which
extends
two
or
three
inches
outward
and
spreads
at
the
end
like
the
petals
of
a
lily
round
the
neck
is
a
collar
of
fox
fur
and
covering
the
body
are
flowing
robes
of
sacred
embroidered
mantles
which
notwithstanding
the
gay
ornaments
and
other
appurtenances
of
the
costume
have
in
connection
with
the
expression
of
the
mask
a
spectral
effect
the
feet
are
encased
in
brilliantly
painted
moccasins
of
archaic
form
and
the
wrists
laden
with
shell
bracelets
and
when
the
long
file
of
these
strange
figures
making
up
the
k
yámakwe
drama
dance
comes
in
from
the
southward
to
the
dance
plazas
of
the
pueblo
each
member
of
it
bears
on
his
back
freshly
slain
deer
antelope
rabbits
and
other
game
animals
or
portions
of
them
in
abundance
made
up
in
packages
highly
decorated
with
tufts
of
evergreen
and
painted
toys
for
presentation
to
the
children
in
one
hand
are
carried
bows
and
arrows
and
in
the
other
a
peculiar
rattle
or
clanger
made
of
the
of
deer
the
wonder
expressed
by
the
coyote
as
the
story
goes
on
and
his
excessive
admiration
of
the
children
of
the
k
yámakwe
may
therefore
be
understood
one
day
the
old
coyote
of
cedar
cañon
went
out
hunting
and
as
he
was
prowling
around
among
the
below
thunder
mountain
he
heard
the
clang
and
rattle
and
the
shrill
cries
of
the
k
yámakwe
he
pricked
up
his
ears
stuck
his
nose
into
the
air
sniffed
about
and
looked
all
around
and
presently
discovered
the
k
yámakwe
children
running
rapidly
back
and
forth
on
the
very
edge
of
the
mountain
delight
of
my
senses
what
pretty
creatures
they
are
good
for
me
he
piped
in
a
jovial
voice
i
am
the
finder
of
children
i
must
capture
the
little
fellows
tomorrow
and
bring
them
up
as
coyotes
ought
to
be
brought
up
aren
t
they
handsome
though
all
this
he
said
to
himself
in
a
fit
of
conceit
with
his
nose
in
the
air
presumptuous
cur
planning
to
steal
the
children
of
a
god
he
hunted
no
more
that
day
but
ran
home
as
fast
as
he
could
and
arriving
there
he
said
wife
wife
o
wife
i
have
discovered
a
number
of
the
prettiest
waifs
one
ever
saw
they
are
children
of
the
but
what
matters
that
they
are
there
running
back
and
forth
and
clanging
their
rattles
along
the
very
edge
of
thunder
mountain
i
mean
to
steal
them
tomorrow
every
one
of
them
and
bring
them
here
mercy
on
us
exclaimed
the
old
coyote
s
wife
there
are
children
enough
and
to
spare
already
what
in
the
world
can
we
do
with
all
of
them
you
fool
but
they
are
pretty
said
the
coyote
immensely
fine
every
coyote
in
the
country
would
envy
us
the
possession
of
them
but
you
say
they
are
many
continued
the
wife
well
yes
a
good
many
said
the
coyote
well
why
not
divide
them
among
our
associated
clans
suggested
the
old
woman
you
never
can
capture
them
alone
it
is
rare
enough
that
you
capture
alone
leave
out
the
children
of
the
k
yámakwe
get
your
relatives
to
help
you
and
divide
the
children
amongst
well
now
come
to
think
of
it
it
is
a
good
plan
said
the
coyote
with
his
nose
on
his
neck
if
i
get
up
this
expedition
i
ll
be
a
big
chief
won
t
i
hurrah
here
s
for
it
he
shouted
and
switching
his
tail
in
the
face
of
his
wife
he
shot
out
of
the
hole
and
ran
away
to
a
high
rock
where
squatting
down
with
a
most
important
air
and
his
nose
lifted
high
he
cried
out
hii
su
su
su
su
listen

all
coyotes
of
the
tribe
coyotes
of
the
tribe
coyotes
of
the
tribe
coyotes
of
the
tribe
i
have
instructions
for
you
this
day
i
have
found
waif
children
many
of
the
k
yámakwe
the
young
i
would
steal
the
many
of
the

yámakwe
the
young
i
would
steal

that
they
may
be
adopted
of
us
i
would
have
your
aid
in
the
stealing
of
the
k
yámakwe
young
listen
ye
all
and
tomorrow
gather
in
council
thus
much
i
instruct
ye
coyotes
of
the
tribe
coyotes
of
the
tribe
coyotes
of
the
tribe
coyotes
of
the
tribe
it
was
growing
dark
and
immediately
from
all
quarters
in
dark
places
under
the
cañons
and
arroyos
issued
answering
howls
and
howls
you
should
have
seen
that
crowd
of
coyotes
the
next
morning
large
and
small
old
and
young
all
four
tribes
gathered
together
in
the
plain
below
thunder
mountain
when
they
had
all
assembled
the
coyote
who
had
made
the
discovery
mounted
an
sat
down
and
lifting
his
paw
was
about
to
give
directions
with
the
air
of
a
chief
when
an
ant
bit
him
he
lost
his
dignity
but
resumed
it
again
on
the
top
of
a
neighboring
rock
again
he
stuck
his
nose
into
the
air
and
his
paw
out
and
with
ridiculous
assumption
informed
the
coyotes
that
he
was
chief
of
them
all
and
that
they
would
do
well
to
pay
attention
to
his
directions
he
then
showed
himself
much
more
skilful
than
you
might
have
expected
as
you
know
the
cliff
of
thunder
mountain
is
very
steep
especially
that
part
back
of
the
two
standing
rocks
well
this
was
the
direction
of
the
coyote
one
of
you
shall
place
himself
at
the
base
of
the
mountain
another
shall
climb
over
him
and
the
first
one
shall
grasp
his
tail
and
another
over
them
and
his
tail
shall
be
grasped
by
the
second
and
so
on
until
the
top
is
reached
hang
tight
my
friends
every
one
of
you
and
every
one
fall
in
line
eructate
thoroughly
before
you
do
so
if
you
do
not
we
may
be
in
a
pretty
mess
for
supposing
that
any
one
along
the
line
should
hiccough
he
would
lose
his
hold
and
down
we
would
all
fall
so
the
coyotes
all
at
once
began
to
curve
their
necks
and
swell
themselves
up
and
strain
and
wriggle
and
belch
wind
as
much
as
possible
then
all
fell
into
a
line
and
grabbed
each
other
s
tails
and
thus
they
extended
themselves
in
a
long
string
up
the
very
face
of
thunder
mountain
a
ridiculous
little
pup
was
at
one
end
and
a
good
strong
grizzled
old
fellow
no
other
than
the
chief
of
the
party
at
the
other
souls
of
my
ancestors
hang
tight
my
friends
hang
tight
hang
tight
said
he
when
suddenly
one
near
the
top
in
the
agitation
of
the
moment
began
to
sneeze
lost
his
hold
and
down
the
whole
string
hundreds
of
them
fell
and
were
completely
flattened
out
among
the
rocks
the
warrior
of
the
he
of
the
long
horn
with
frightful
staring
eyes
and
visage
blue
with
rage
bow
and
in
hand
was
hastening
from
the
sacred
lake
in
the
west
to
rescue
the
children
of
the
k
yámakwe
when
he
arrived
they
had
been
rescued
already
so
after
storming
around
a
little
and
mauling
such
of
the
coyotes
as
were
not
quite
dead
he
set
to
skin
them
all
and
ever
since
then
you
will
observe
that
the
dancers
of
the
long
horn
have
blue
faces
and
whenever
they
arrive
in
our
pueblo
wear
collars
of
about
their
necks
that
is
the
way
they
got
them
before
that
they
had
no
collars
it
is
presumable
that
that
is
the
reason
why
they
bellow
so
and
have
such
hoarse
voices
having
previously
taken
cold
every
one
of
them
for
the
want
of
fur
collars
thus
shortens
my
story
the
coyote
and
the
beetle
in
remote
times
after
our
ancients
were
settled
at
middle
ant
hill
a
little
thing
occurred
which
will
explain
a
great
deal
my
children
you
have
doubtless
seen
they
run
around
on
smooth
hard
patches
of
ground
in
spring
time
and
early
summer
kicking
their
heels
into
the
air
and
thrusting
their
heads
into
any
crack
or
hole
they
find
well
in
ancient
times
on
the
pathway
leading
around
to
fat
mountain
there
was
one
of
these
beetles
running
about
in
all
directions
in
the
sunshine
when
a
coyote
came
trotting
along
he
pricked
up
his
ears
lowered
his
nose
arched
his
neck
and
stuck
out
his
paw
toward
the
beetle
ha
said
he
i
shall
bite
you
the
beetle
immediately
stuck
his
head
down
close
to
the
ground
and
lifting
one
of
his
antennæ
deprecatingly
exclaimed
hold
on
hold
on
friend
wait
a
bit
for
the
love
of
mercy
i
hear
something
very
strange
down
below
here
humph
replied
the
coyote
what
do
you
hear
hush
hush
cried
the
beetle
with
his
head
still
to
the
ground
listen
so
the
coyote
drew
back
and
listened
most
attentively
the
beetle
lifted
himself
with
a
long
sigh
of
relief
exclaimed
the
coyote
what
was
going
on
the
good
soul
save
us
exclaimed
the
beetle
with
a
shake
of
his
head
i
heard
them
saying
down
there
that
tomorrow
they
would
chase
away
and
thoroughly
chastise
everybody
who
defiled
the
public
trails
of
this
country
and
they
are
making
ready
as
fast
as
they
can
souls
of
my
ancestors
cried
the
coyote
i
have
been
loitering
along
this
trail
this
very
morning
and
have
defiled
it
repeatedly
i
ll
cut
and
away
he
ran
as
fast
as
he
could
go
the
beetle
in
pure
exuberance
of
spirits
turned
somersaults
and
stuck
his
head
in
the
sand
until
it
was
quite
turned
thus
did
the
beetle
in
the
days
of
the
ancients
save
himself
from
being
bitten
consequently
the
has
that
strange
habit
of
kicking
his
heels
into
the
air
and
sticking
his
head
in
the
sand
thus
shortens
my
story
how
the
coyote
danced
with
the
blackbirds
one
late
autumn
day
in
the
times
of
the
ancients
a
large
council
of
blackbirds
were
gathered
fluttering
and
chattering
on
the
smooth
rocky
slopes
of
gorge
mountain
northwest
of
zuñi
like
ourselves
these
birds
as
you
are
well
aware
congregate
together
in
autumn
time
when
the
harvests
are
ripe
to
indulge
in
their
festivities
before
going
into
winter
quarters
only
we
do
not
move
away
while
they
on
strong
wings
and
swift
retreat
for
a
time
to
the
land
of
everlasting
summer
well
on
this
particular
morning
they
were
making
a
great
noise
and
having
a
grand
dance
and
this
was
the
way
of
it
they
would
gather
in
one
vast
flock
somewhat
orderly
in
its
disposition
on
the
sloping
face
of
gorge
mountain
the
older
birds
in
front
the
younger
ones
behind
down
the
slope
chirping
and
fluttering
they
would
hop
hop

singing

down
the
mountain
of
the

blackbirds

o

o
and
spreading
their
wings
with
many
a
flutter
flurry
and
scurry
keh
keh
keh
keh
keh

they
would
fly
away
into
the
air
swirling
off
in
a
dense
black
flock
circling
far
upward
and
onward
then
wheeling
about
and
darting
down
they
would
dip
themselves
in
the
broad
spring
which
flows
out
at
the
foot
of
the
mountain
and
return
to
their
dancing
place
on
the
rocky
slopes
a
coyote
was
out
hunting
as
if
he
could
catch
anything
the
beast
and
saw
them
and
was
enraptured
you
beautiful
creatures
he
exclaimed
you
graceful
dancers
delight
of
my
senses
how
do
you
do
that
anyway
couldn
t
i
join
in
your
dance
the
first
part
of
it
at
least
why
certainly
yes
said
the
blackbirds
we
are
quite
willing
the
masters
of
the
ceremony
said
well
said
the
coyote
i
can
get
on
the
slope
of
the
rocks
and
i
can
sing
the
song
with
you
but
i
suppose
that
when
you
leap
off
into
the
air
i
shall
have
to
sit
there
patting
the
rock
with
my
paw
and
my
tail
and
singing
while
you
have
the
fun
of
it
may
be
said
an
old
blackbird
that
we
can
fit
you
out
so
that
you
can
fly
with
is
it
possible
cried
the
coyote
then
by
all
means
do
so
by
the
blessed
immortals
now
if
i
am
only
able
to
circle
off
into
the
air
like
you
fellows
i
ll
be
the
biggest
coyote
in
the
world
i
think
it
will
be
easy
resumed
the
old
blackbird
my
children
said
he
you
are
many
and
many
are
your
contribute
each
one
of
you
a
feather
to
our
thereupon
the
blackbirds
each
one
of
them
plucked
a
feather
from
his
wing
unfortunately
they
all
plucked
feathers
from
the
wings
on
the
same
side
are
you
sure
my
friend
continued
the
old
blackbird
that
you
are
willing
to
go
through
the
operation
of
having
these
feathers
planted
in
your
skin
if
so
i
think
we
can
fit
you
willing
why
of
course
i
am
and
the
coyote
held
up
one
of
his
arms
and
sitting
down
steadied
himself
with
his
tail
then
the
blackbirds
thrust
in
the
feathers
all
along
the
rear
of
his
forelegs
and
down
the
sides
of
his
back
where
wings
ought
to
be
it
hurt
and
the
coyote
twitched
his
mustache
considerably
but
he
said
nothing
when
it
was
done
he
asked
am
i
ready
now
yes
said
the
blackbirds
we
think
you
ll
so
they
formed
themselves
again
on
the
upper
part
of
the
slope
sang
their
songs
and
hopped
along
down
with
many
a
flutter
flurry
and
scurry
keh
keh
keh
keh
and
away
they
flew
off
into
the
air
the
coyote
somewhat
startled
got
out
of
time
but
followed
bravely
making
heavy
flops
but
as
i
have
said
before
the
wings
he
was
supplied
with
were
composed
of
feathers
all
plucked
from
one
side
and
therefore
he
flew
slanting
and
spirally
and
brought
up
with
a
whack
which
nearly
knocked
the
breath
out
of
him
against
the
side
of
the
mountain
he
picked
himself
up
and
shook
himself
and
cried
out
hold
hold
hold
on
hold
on
there
to
the
blackbirds
you
ve
left
me
behind
when
the
birds
returned
they
explained
your
wings
are
not
quite
thick
enough
friend
and
besides
even
a
young
blackbird
when
he
is
first
learning
to
fly
does
just
this
sort
of
thing
that
you
have
been
doing
makes
bad
work
of
sit
down
again
said
the
old
blackbird
and
he
called
out
to
the
rest
get
feathers
from
your
other
sides
also
and
be
careful
to
select
a
few
strong
feathers
from
the
tips
of
the
wings
for
by
means
of
these
we
cleave
the
air
guide
our
movements
and
sustain
our
so
the
blackbirds
all
did
as
they
were
bidden
and
after
the
new
feathers
were
planted
each
one
plucked
out
a
and
the
most
skilful
of
the
blackbirds
inserted
these
feathers
into
the
tip
of
the
coyote
s
tail
it
made
him
wince
and
yip
occasionally
but
he
stood
it
bravely
and
reared
his
head
proudly
thinking
all
the
while
what
a
splendid
coyote
i
shall
be
did
ever
anyone
hear
of
a
coyote
flying
the
procession
formed
again
down
the
slope
they
went
singing
their
song
and
away
they
flew
into
the
air
the
coyote
in
their
midst
far
off
and
high
they
circled
and
circled
the
coyote
cutting
more
eager
pranks
than
any
of
the
rest
finally
they
returned
dipped
themselves
again
into
the
spring
and
settled
on
the
slopes
of
the
rocks
there
now
cried
out
the
coyote
with
a
flutter
of
his
feathery
tail
i
can
fly
as
well
as
the
rest
of
indeed
you
do
well
exclaimed
the
blackbirds
shall
we
try
it
again
oh
yes
oh
yes
i
m
a
little
winded
cried
the
coyote
but
this
is
the
best
fun
i
ever
the
blackbirds
however
were
not
satisfied
with
their
companion
they
found
him
less
sedate
than
a
dancer
ought
to
be
and
moreover
his
irregular
in
the
air
were
not
to
their
taste
so
the
old
ones
whispered
to
one
another
this
fellow
is
a
fool
and
we
must
pluck
him
when
he
gets
into
the
air
we
ll
fly
so
far
this
time
that
he
will
get
a
little
tired
out
and
cry
to
us
for
the
procession
formed
and
down
the
mountain
slope
they
went
and
with
many
a
flutter
and
flurry
flew
off
into
the
air
the
coyote
unable
to
restrain
himself
even
took
the
lead
on
and
on
and
on
they
flew
the
blackbirds
and
the
coyote
and
up
and
up
and
up
and
they
circled
round
and
round
until
the
coyote
found
himself
missing
a
wing
stroke
occasionally
and
falling
out
of
line
and
he
cried
out
help
help
friends
help
all
right
cried
the
blackbirds
catch
hold
of
his
wings
hold
him
up
cried
the
old
ones
and
the
blackbirds
flew
at
him
and
every
time
they
caught
hold
of
him
the
old
fool
all
the
time
thinking
they
were
helping
they
plucked
out
a
feather
until
at
last
the
feathers
had
become
so
thin
that
he
began
to
fall
and
he
fell
and
fell
and
fell
flop
flop
flop
he
went
through
the
air
the
few
feathers
left
in
his
forelegs
and
sides
and
the
tip
of
his
tail
just
saving
him
from
being
utterly
crushed
as
he
fell
with
a
thud
to
the
ground
he
lost
his
senses
completely
and
lay
there
as
if
dead
for
a
long
time
when
he
awoke
he
shook
his
head
sadly
and
with
a
crestfallen
countenance
and
tail
dragging
between
his
legs
betook
himself
to
his
home
over
the
mountains
the
agony
of
that
fall
had
been
so
great
and
the
heat
of
his
exertions
so
excessive
that
the
feathers
left
in
his
forelegs
and
were
all
shrivelled
up
into
little
ugly
black
fringes
of
hair
his
descendants
were
many
therefore
you
will
often
meet
coyotes
to
this
day
who
have
little
black
fringes
along
the
rear
of
their
forelegs
and
the
tips
of
their
tails
are
often
black
thus
it
was
in
the
days
of
the
ancients
thus
shortens
my
story
how
the
turtle
out
hunting
duped
the
coyote
in
the
times
of
the
ancients
long
long
ago
near
the
highflowing
river
on
the
zuñi
mountains
there
lived
an
old
turtle
he
went
out
hunting
one
day
and
by
means
of
his
ingenuity
killed
a
large
fine
deer
when
he
had
thrown
the
deer
to
the
ground
he
had
no
means
of
skinning
it
he
sat
down
and
reflected
scratching
the
lid
of
his
eye
with
the
nail
of
his
hind
foot
he
concluded
he
would
have
to
go
hunting
for
a
therefore
he
set
forth
he
came
after
a
while
to
a
place
where
old
buildings
had
stood
then
he
began
to
hum
an
old
magic
song
such
as
it
is
said
the
ancients
sung
when
they
hunted
for
the
flint
of
which
to
make
knives
he
sang
in
this
way
tse
wash
apatsinan
tse
wash
tsepa
tsepa
which
may
be
translated
not
perhaps
correctly
but
well
enough
oh
make
yourself
known
oh
make
yourself
known
magically
magically
as
he
was
thus
crawling
about
and
singing
a
coyote
running
through
the
woods
overheard
him
he
exclaimed
uh
i
wonder
who
is
singing
and
what
he
is
saying
ah
he
is
hunting
for
a
is
he
evidently
somebody
who
has
killed
a
deer
he
turned
back
and
ran
over
to
where
the
old
turtle
was
as
he
neared
him
he
cried
out
halloo
friend
didn
t
i
hear
you
singing
yes
was
the
reply
of
the
turtle
what
were
you
singing
nothing
in
yes
you
were
too
what
were
you
saying
nothing
in
particular
i
tell
you
at
least
nothing
that
concerns
yes
you
were
saying
something
and
this
is
what
you
and
so
the
coyote
who
could
not
sing
the
song
deliberately
repeated
the
words
he
had
heard
well
suppose
i
did
say
so
what
of
that
said
the
turtle
why
you
were
hunting
for
a
that
is
why
you
said
what
you
did
replied
the
coyote
well
what
of
that
what
did
you
want
the
for
nothing
in
particular
replied
the
turtle
yes
you
did
you
wanted
it
for
something
what
was
it
nothing
in
particular
i
say
replied
the
turtle
at
least
nothing
that
concerns
yes
you
did
want
it
for
something
said
the
coyote
and
i
know
what
it
was
well
what
asked
the
turtle
who
was
waxing
rather
angry
you
wanted
it
to
skin
a
deer
with
that
s
what
you
wanted
it
for
where
is
the
deer
now
come
you
have
killed
a
deer
and
i
know
it
tell
where
is
well
it
lies
over
yonder
replied
the
turtle
where
come
let
us
go
i
ll
help
you
skin
i
can
get
along
very
well
without
you
replied
the
turtle
what
if
i
do
help
you
a
little
i
am
very
hungry
this
morning
and
would
like
to
lap
up
the
well
then
come
along
torment
replied
the
turtle
so
finding
a
knife
they
proceeded
to
where
the
deer
was
lying
let
me
hold
him
for
you
cried
the
coyote
whereupon
he
jumped
over
the
deer
spread
out
its
hind
legs
and
placed
a
paw
on
each
of
them
holding
the
body
open
and
thus
they
began
to
skin
the
deer
when
they
had
finished
this
work
the
coyote
turned
to
the
turtle
and
asked
how
much
of
him
are
you
going
to
give
me
the
usual
parts
that
fall
to
anyone
who
comes
along
when
the
hunter
is
skinning
a
deer
replied
the
turtle
what
parts
eagerly
asked
the
coyote
stomach
and
liver
replied
the
turtle
briefly
i
won
t
take
that
whined
the
coyote
i
want
you
to
give
me
half
of
the
i
ll
do
no
such
thing
replied
the
turtle
i
killed
the
deer
you
only
helped
to
skin
him
and
you
ought
to
be
satisfied
with
my
liberality
in
giving
you
the
stomach
and
liver
alone
i
ll
throw
in
a
little
fat
to
be
sure
and
some
of
the
intestines
but
i
ll
give
you
no
yes
you
will
too
snarled
the
coyote
showing
his
teeth
oh
will
i
replied
the
turtle
deliberately
hauling
in
one
or
two
of
his
flippers
yes
you
will
or
i
ll
simply
murder
you
that
s
the
turtle
immediately
pulled
his
feet
head
and
tail
in
and
cried
i
tell
you
i
ll
give
you
nothing
but
the
stomach
and
liver
and
some
of
the
intestines
of
this
deer
well
then
i
will
forthwith
kill
you
snapped
the
coyote
and
he
made
a
grab
for
the
turtle
sounded
his
teeth
as
they
struck
on
the
hard
shell
of
the
turtle
and
bite
as
he
would
the
turtle
simply
slipped
out
of
his
mouth
every
time
he
grabbed
him
he
rolled
the
turtle
over
and
over
to
find
a
good
place
for
biting
and
held
him
between
his
paws
as
if
he
were
a
bone
and
gnawed
at
him
but
do
his
best
kopo
his
teeth
kept
slipping
off
the
turtle
s
hard
shell
at
last
he
exclaimed
rather
hotly
there
s
more
than
one
way
of
killing
a
beast
like
you
so
he
set
the
turtle
up
on
end
and
catching
up
a
quantity
of
sand
stuffed
it
into
the
hole
where
the
turtle
s
head
had
disappeared
and
tapped
it
well
down
with
a
stick
until
he
had
completely
filled
the
crevice
there
now
he
exclaimed
with
a
snicker
of
delight
i
think
i
have
fixed
you
now
old
hardshell
and
served
you
right
too
you
old
whereupon
he
whisked
away
to
the
meat
the
turtle
considered
it
best
to
die
as
it
were
but
he
listened
intently
to
what
was
going
on
the
coyote
cut
up
the
deer
and
made
a
package
of
him
in
his
own
skin
then
he
washed
the
stomach
in
a
neighboring
brook
and
filled
it
with
choppings
of
the
liver
and
kidneys
and
fat
stripped
from
the
intestines
and
clots
of
blood
dashing
in
a
few
sprigs
of
herbs
here
and
there
then
according
to
the
custom
of
hunters
in
all
times
he
dug
an
oven
in
the
ground
and
buried
the
stomach
in
order
to
make
a
baked
of
it
while
he
was
summoning
his
family
and
friends
to
help
him
take
the
meat
home
the
turtle
clawed
a
little
of
the
sand
away
from
his
neck
and
peered
out
just
a
trifle
he
heard
the
coyote
grunting
as
he
tried
to
lift
the
meat
in
order
to
hang
it
on
a
branch
of
a
neighboring
pine
tree
he
was
just
exclaiming
what
a
lucky
fellow
i
am
to
come
on
that
lame
helpless
old
wretch
and
get
all
this
meat
from
him
without
the
trouble
of
hunting
for
it
to
be
sure
ah
my
dear
children
my
fine
old
wife
what
a
feast
we
will
have
this
day
for
you
know
the
coyote
had
a
large
family
over
the
way
he
was
just
exclaiming
this
i
say
when
the
turtle
cried
out
faintly
you
old
scoundrel
you
ugly
beast
you
snarled
the
coyote
so
you
are
alive
are
you
dropping
the
meat
he
leaped
back
to
where
the
turtle
was
lying
his
head
hauled
in
again
and
jamming
every
crevice
full
of
sand
made
it
hard
and
firm
then
hitting
the
turtle
a
clip
with
the
tip
of
his
nose
he
sent
him
rolling
over
and
over
like
a
flat
round
stone
down
the
slope
this
is
fine
treatment
to
receive
from
the
hands
of
such
a
sneaking
cur
as
that
thought
the
turtle
i
think
i
will
keep
quiet
this
time
and
let
him
do
as
he
pleases
but
through
my
ingenuity
i
killed
the
deer
and
it
may
be
that
through
ingenuity
i
can
keep
the
so
the
turtle
kept
perfectly
dead
to
all
appearances
and
the
coyote
leaving
the
meat
hanging
on
a
low
branch
of
a
tree
and
building
a
fire
over
the
oven
he
had
excavated
whisked
away
with
his
tail
in
the
air
to
his
house
just
the
other
side
of
the
mountain
when
he
arrived
there
he
cried
out
wife
wife
children
children
come
quick
great
news
killed
an
enormous
deer
today
i
have
made
a
in
his
stomach
and
buried
it
let
us
go
and
have
a
feast
then
you
must
help
me
bring
the
meat
those
coyotes
were
perfectly
wild
the
cubs
with
their
tails
more
like
sticks
than
brushes
trembled
from
the
ends
of
their
to
the
tips
of
their
tails
and
they
all
set
off
the
old
ones
ahead
the
young
ones
following
single
file
as
fast
as
they
could
toward
the
place
where
the
was
buried
now
as
soon
as
the
old
turtle
was
satisfied
that
the
coyote
had
left
he
dug
the
sand
out
of
his
collar
with
his
tough
claws
and
proceeding
to
the
place
where
the
meat
hung
first
hauled
it
up
piece
by
piece
to
the
very
top
of
the
tree
for
turtles
have
claws
you
know
and
can
climb
especially
if
the
trunk
of
the
tree
leans
over
as
that
one
did
having
hauled
the
meat
to
the
very
topmost
branches
of
the
tree
and
tied
it
there
securely
he
descended
and
went
over
to
where
the
was
buried
he
raked
the
embers
away
from
it
and
pulled
it
out
then
he
dragged
it
off
to
a
neighboring
where
the
red
were
congregated
in
great
numbers
immediately
they
began
to
rush
out
smelling
the
cooked
meat
and
the
turtle
untying
the
end
of
the
stomach
chucked
as
many
of
the
ants
as
he
could
into
it
then
he
dragged
the
pudding
back
to
the
fire
and
replaced
it
in
the
oven
taking
care
that
the
coals
should
not
get
near
it
he
had
barely
climbed
the
tree
again
and
nestled
himself
on
his
bundle
of
meat
when
along
came
those
eager
coyotes
everything
stuck
up
all
over
them
with
anxiety
for
the
feast
their
hair
the
tips
of
their
ears
and
the
points
of
their
tails
and
as
they
neared
the
place
and
smelt
the
blood
and
the
cooked
meat
they
began
to
sing
and
dance
as
they
came
along
and
this
was
what
they
sang
tsa
tsa
tsa
tsa
we
will
have
to
translate
this
which
is
so
old
that
who
can
remember
exactly
what
it
means
thus
meat
of
the
deer
meat
of
the
deer
luscious
meat
of
the
deer
luscious
meat
of
the
deer
luscious
luscious
no
sooner
had
they
neared
the
spot
where
they
smelt
the
meat
than
without
looking
around
at
all
they
made
a
bound
for
it
but
the
old
coyote
grabbed
the
hindmost
of
the
young
ones
by
the
ear
until
he
yelped
shook
him
and
called
out
to
all
the
rest
look
you
here
eat
in
a
decent
manner
or
you
will
burn
your
chops
off
i
stuffed
the
pudding
full
of
grease
and
the
moment
you
puncture
it
the
grease
being
hot
will
fly
out
and
burn
you
be
careful
and
dignified
children
there
is
plenty
of
time
and
you
shall
be
satisfied
don
t
gorge
at
the
first
helping
but
the
moment
the
little
coyotes
were
freed
they
made
a
grand
bounce
for
the
tempting
stomach
tearing
it
open
and
grabbing
huge
mouthfuls
it
may
be
surmised
that
the
were
not
comfortable
they
ran
all
over
the
lips
and
cheeks
of
the
voracious
little
gormands
and
bit
them
until
they
cried
out
shaking
their
heads
and
rubbing
them
in
the
sand
there
now
didn
t
i
tell
you
little
fools
to
be
careful
it
was
the
grease
that
burnt
you
now
i
hope
you
know
enough
to
eat
a
little
more
moderately
there
s
plenty
of
time
to
satisfy
yourselves
i
say
cried
the
old
coyote
sitting
down
on
his
haunches
then
the
little
cubs
and
the
old
woman
attacked
the
delicacy
again
they
exclaimed
shaking
their
heads
and
flapping
their
ears
and
presently
they
all
went
away
and
sat
down
observing
this
wonderful
hot
pudding
it
may
be
well
to
explain
here
that
there
is
no
more
intensely
painful
or
fiery
bite
known
than
the
bite
of
the
or
red
ant
of
the
southwest
and
the
tropics
named
in
zuñi
large
pimples
and
blisters
are
raised
by
the
bite
which
is
so
venomous
moreover
that
for
the
time
being
it
poisons
the
blood
and
fills
every
vein
of
the
body
with
burning
sensations
then
the
coyote
looked
around
and
observed
that
the
meat
was
gone
and
following
the
grease
and
blood
spots
up
the
tree
with
his
eye
saw
in
the
top
the
pack
of
meat
with
the
turtle
calmly
reclining
upon
it
and
resting
his
head
stretched
far
out
on
his
hand
the
turtle
lifted
his
head
and
exclaimed
you
old
beast
yelled
the
coyote
in
an
ecstasy
of
rage
and
disappointment
throw
down
some
of
that
meat
now
will
you
i
killed
that
deer
you
only
helped
me
skin
him
and
here
you
have
stolen
all
the
meat
wife
children
didn
t
i
kill
the
deer
he
cried
turning
to
the
rest
certainly
you
did
and
he
s
a
sneaking
old
wretch
to
steal
it
from
you
they
exclaimed
in
chorus
looking
longingly
at
the
pack
of
meat
in
the
top
of
the
tree
who
said
i
stole
the
meat
from
you
cried
out
the
turtle
i
only
hauled
it
up
here
to
keep
it
from
being
stolen
you
villain
scatter
yourselves
out
to
catch
some
of
it
i
will
throw
as
fine
a
pair
of
ribs
down
to
you
as
ever
you
saw
there
now
spread
yourselves
out
and
get
close
together
ready
he
called
as
the
coyotes
lay
down
on
their
backs
side
by
side
and
stretched
their
paws
as
high
as
they
could
eagerly
and
tremblingly
toward
the
meat
yes
yes
cried
the
coyotes
in
one
voice
we
are
all
ready
now
then
the
old
turtle
took
up
the
pair
of
ribs
and
catching
them
in
his
beak
crawled
out
to
the
end
of
the
branch
immediately
over
the
coyotes
and
giving
them
a
good
fling
dropped
them
as
hard
as
he
could
over
and
over
they
fell
and
then
came
down
like
a
pair
of
stones
across
the
bodies
of
the
coyotes
crushing
the
wind
out
of
them
so
that
they
had
no
breath
left
with
which
to
cry
out
and
most
of
them
were
instantly
killed
but
the
two
little
cubs
at
either
side
escaped
with
only
a
hurt
or
two
and
after
yelling
fearfully
one
of
them
took
his
tail
between
his
legs
and
ran
away
the
other
one
still
very
hungry
ran
off
with
his
tail
lowered
and
his
nose
to
the
ground
sidewise
until
he
had
got
to
a
safe
distance
and
then
he
sat
down
and
looked
up
presently
he
thought
he
would
return
and
eat
some
of
the
meat
from
the
ribs
wait
cried
the
old
turtle
don
t
go
near
that
meat
leave
it
alone
for
your
parents
and
brothers
and
sisters
really
i
am
so
old
and
stiff
that
it
took
me
a
long
time
to
get
out
to
the
end
of
that
limb
and
i
am
afraid
they
went
to
sleep
while
i
was
getting
there
for
see
how
still
they
by
my
ancestors
exclaimed
the
coyote
looking
at
them
that
is
why
don
t
you
come
up
here
and
have
a
feast
with
me
said
the
turtle
and
leave
that
meat
alone
for
your
brothers
and
sisters
and
your
old
ones
how
can
i
get
up
there
whined
the
coyote
crawling
nearer
to
the
tree
simply
reach
up
until
you
get
your
paw
over
one
of
the
branches
and
then
haul
yourself
up
replied
the
turtle
the
little
coyote
stretched
and
jumped
and
though
he
sometimes
succeeded
in
getting
his
paw
over
the
branch
he
fell
back
every
time
and
then
he
would
yelp
and
sing
out
as
though
every
bone
in
his
body
was
broken
never
mind
never
mind
cried
the
turtle
i
ll
come
down
and
help
so
he
crawled
down
the
tree
and
reaching
over
grabbed
the
little
coyote
by
the
and
by
much
struggling
he
was
able
to
climb
up
when
they
got
to
the
top
of
the
tree
the
turtle
said
there
now
help
the
little
coyote
fell
to
and
filled
himself
so
full
that
he
was
as
round
as
a
plum
and
elastic
as
a
cranberry
then
he
looked
about
and
licked
his
chops
and
tried
to
breathe
but
couldn
t
more
than
half
and
said
oh
my
if
i
don
t
get
some
water
i
ll
choke
my
friend
said
the
turtle
do
you
see
that
drop
of
water
gleaming
in
the
sun
at
the
end
of
that
branch
of
this
pine
tree
it
was
really
pitch
now
i
have
lived
in
the
tops
of
trees
so
much
that
i
know
where
to
go
trees
have
springs
look
at
the
coyote
looked
and
was
convinced
walk
out
now
to
the
end
of
the
branch
or
until
you
come
to
one
of
those
drops
of
water
then
take
it
in
your
mouth
and
suck
and
all
the
water
you
want
will
flow
the
little
coyote
started
he
trembled
and
was
unsteady
on
his
legs
but
managed
to
get
half
way
is
it
here
he
called
turning
round
and
looking
back
no
a
little
farther
said
the
turtle
so
he
cautiously
stepped
a
little
farther
the
branch
was
swaying
dreadfully
he
turned
his
head
and
just
as
he
was
saying
is
it
here
he
lost
his
balance
and
fell
plump
to
the
ground
striking
so
hard
on
the
tough
earth
that
he
was
instantly
killed
there
you
wretched
beast
said
the
old
turtle
with
a
sigh
of
relief
and
satisfaction
ingenuity
enabled
me
to
kill
a
deer
ingenuity
enabled
me
to
retain
the
it
must
not
be
forgotten
that
one
of
the
little
coyotes
ran
away
he
had
numerous
descendants
and
ever
since
that
time
they
have
been
characterized
by
pimples
all
over
their
faces
where
the
mustaches
grow
out
and
little
blotches
inside
of
their
lips
such
as
you
see
inside
the
lips
of
dogs
thus
shortens
my
story
the
coyote
and
the
locust
in
the
days
of
the
ancients
there
lived
south
of
zuñi
beyond
the
headland
of
rocks
at
a
place
called
rock
hollow
of
the
coyotes
an
old
coyote
and
this
side
of
the
headland
of
rocks
in
the
bank
of
a
steep
arroyo
lived
an
old
locust
near
where
stood
a
piñon
tree
crooked
and
so
bereft
of
needles
that
it
was
sunny
one
day
the
coyote
went
out
hunting
leaving
his
large
family
of
children
and
his
old
wife
at
home
it
was
a
fine
day
and
the
sun
was
shining
brightly
and
the
old
locust
crawled
out
of
his
home
in
the
loam
of
the
arroyo
and
ascended
to
one
of
the
bare
branches
of
the
piñon
tree
where
hooking
his
feet
firmly
into
the
bark
he
began
to
sing
and
play
his
flute
the
coyote
in
his
wanderings
came
along
just
as
he
began
to
sing
these
words
tchumali

locust
playing
a

away
up
above
on
the
bough
closely
clinging
playing
a
flute
playing
a
flute
delight
of
my
senses
called
out
the
coyote
squatting
down
on
his
haunches
and
looking
up
with
his
ears
pricked
and
his
mouth
grinning
delight
of
my
senses
how
finely
you
play
your
flute
do
you
think
so
said
the
locust
continuing
his
song
goodness
yes
cried
the
coyote
shifting
nearer
what
a
song
it
is
pray
teach
it
to
me
so
that
i
can
take
it
home
and
dance
my
children
to
it
i
have
a
large
family
at
all
right
said
the
locust
listen
and
he
sang
his
song
again
tchumali

yaamii

cried
the
coyote
now
shall
i
try
yes
then
in
a
very
hoarse
voice
the
coyote
half
growled
and
half
sang
making
a
mistake
here
and
there
to
be
sure
what
the
locust
had
sung
though
there
was
very
little
music
in
his
repetition
of
the
performance
tchumali

he
as

finished
i

i
well
yes
said
the
locust
fairly
now
then
let
us
sing
it
over
and
while
the
locust
piped
shrilly
the
coyote
sang
gruffly
though
much
better
than
at
first
the
song
there
now
exclaimed
he
with
a
whisk
of
his
tail
didn
t
i
tell
you
and
without
waiting
to
say
another
word
he
whisked
away
toward
his
home
beyond
the
headland
of
rocks
as
he
was
running
along
the
plain
he
kept
repeating
the
song
to
himself
so
that
he
would
not
forget
it
casting
his
eyes
into
the
air
after
the
manner
of
men
in
trying
to
remember
or
to
say
particularly
fine
things
so
that
he
did
not
notice
an
old
gopher
peering
at
him
somewhat
ahead
on
the
trail
and
the
old
gopher
laid
a
trap
for
him
in
his
hole
the
coyote
came
trotting
along
singing
when
suddenly
he
tumbled
heels
over
head
into
the
gopher
s
hole
he
sneezed
began
to
cough
and
to
rub
the
sand
out
of
his
eyes
and
then
jumping
out
cursed
the
gopher
heartily
and
tried
to
recall
his
song
but
found
that
he
had
utterly
forgotten
it
so
startled
had
he
been
the
old
gopher
i
wish
the
pests
were
all
in
the
land
of
demons
cried
he
they
dig
their
holes
and
nobody
can
go
anywhere
in
safety
and
now
i
have
forgotten
my
song
well
i
will
run
back
and
get
the
old
locust
to
sing
it
over
again
if
he
can
sit
there
singing
to
himself
why
can
t
he
sing
it
to
me
no
doubt
in
the
world
he
is
still
out
there
on
that
piñon
branch
singing
saying
which
he
ran
back
as
fast
as
he
could
when
he
arrived
at
the
piñon
tree
sure
enough
there
was
the
old
locust
still
sitting
and
singing
now
how
lucky
this
is
my
friend
cried
the
coyote
long
before
he
had
reached
the
place
the
old
gopher
dug
a
hole
right
in
my
path
and
i
went
along
singing
your
delightful
song
and
was
so
busy
with
it
that
i
fell
headlong
into
the
trap
he
had
set
for
me
and
i
was
so
startled
that
on
my
word
i
forgot
all
about
the
song
and
i
have
come
back
to
ask
you
to
sing
it
for
me
very
well
said
the
locust
be
more
careful
this
so
he
sang
the
song
over
good
surely
i
ll
not
forget
it
this
time
cried
the
coyote
so
he
whisked
about
and
away
he
sped
toward
his
home
beyond
the
headland
of
rocks
goodness
said
he
to
himself
as
he
went
along
what
a
fine
thing
this
will
be
for
my
children
how
they
will
be
quieted
by
it
when
i
dance
them
as
i
sing
it
let
s
see
how
it
runs
oh
yes
tchumali
shohkoya
tchumali
tchumali
fluttered
a
flock
of
pigeons
out
of
the
bushes
at
his
very
feet
with
such
a
whizzing
and
whistling
that
the
coyote
nearly
tumbled
over
with
fright
and
recovering
himself
cursed
the
doves
heartily
calling
them
useless
and
between
his
fright
and
his
anger
was
so
much
shaken
up
that
he
again
forgot
his
song
now
the
locust
wisely
concluded
that
this
would
be
the
case
and
as
he
did
not
like
the
coyote
very
well
having
been
told
that
sometimes
members
of
his
tribe
were
by
no
means
friendly
to
locusts
and
other
insects
he
concluded
to
play
him
a
trick
and
teach
him
a
lesson
in
the
minding
of
his
own
affairs
so
catching
tight
hold
of
the
bark
he
swelled
himself
up
and
strained
until
his
back
split
open
then
he
skinned
himself
out
of
his
old
skin
and
crawling
down
the
tree
found
a
suitable
quartz
stone
which
being
and
clear
would
not
make
his
skin
look
unlike
himself
he
took
the
stone
up
the
tree
and
carefully
placed
it
in
the
empty
skin
then
he
cemented
the
back
together
with
a
little
pitch
and
left
his
exact
counterfeit
sticking
to
the
bark
after
which
he
flew
away
to
a
neighboring
tree
no
sooner
had
the
coyote
recovered
his
equanimity
to
some
extent
than
discovering
the
loss
of
his
song
and
again
exclaiming
no
doubt
he
is
still
there
piping
away
i
ll
go
and
get
him
to
sing
it
over
he
ran
back
as
fast
as
he
could
ah
wha
he
exclaimed
as
he
neared
the
tree
i
am
quite
fatigued
with
all
this
extra
running
about
but
no
matter
i
see
you
are
still
there
my
friend
a
lot
of
miserable
flew
up
right
from
under
me
as
i
was
going
along
singing
my
song
and
they
startled
me
so
that
i
forgot
it
but
i
tell
you
i
cursed
them
heartily
now
my
friend
will
you
not
be
good
enough
to
sing
once
more
for
me
he
paused
for
a
reply
none
came
why
what
s
the
matter
don
t
you
hear
me
yelled
the
coyote
running
nearer
looking
closely
and
scrutinizing
the
locust
i
say
i
have
lost
my
song
and
want
you
to
sing
for
me
again
will
you
or
will
you
not
then
he
paused
look
here
are
you
going
to
sing
for
me
or
not
continued
the
coyote
getting
angry
no
reply
the
coyote
stretched
out
his
nose
wrinkled
up
his
lips
and
snarled
look
here
do
you
see
my
teeth
well
i
ll
ask
you
just
four
times
more
to
sing
for
me
and
if
you
don
t
sing
then
i
ll
snap
you
up
in
a
hurry
i
tell
you
will
you
sing
for
me
once
will
you
sing
for
me
twice
two
more
times
look
out
will
you
sing
for
me
are
you
a
fool
do
you
see
my
teeth
only
once
more
will
you
sing
for
me
no
reply
well
you
are
a
fool
yelled
the
coyote
unable
to
restrain
himself
longer
and
making
a
quick
jump
he
snapped
the
locust
skin
off
of
the
bough
and
bit
it
so
hard
that
it
crushed
and
broke
the
teeth
in
the
middle
of
his
jaw
driving
some
of
them
so
far
down
in
his
gums
that
you
could
hardly
see
them
and
crowding
the
others
out
so
that
they
were
regular
tusks
the
coyote
dropped
the
stone
rolled
in
the
sand
and
howled
and
snarled
and
wriggled
with
pain
then
he
got
up
and
shook
his
head
and
ran
away
with
his
tail
between
his
legs
so
excessive
was
his
pain
that
at
the
first
brook
he
came
to
he
stooped
down
to
lap
up
water
in
order
to
alleviate
it
and
he
there
beheld
what
you
and
i
see
in
the
mouths
of
every
coyote
we
ever
catch
that
the
teeth
back
of
the
canines
are
all
driven
down
so
that
you
can
see
only
the
points
of
them
and
look
very
much
broken
up
in
the
days
of
the
ancients
the
coyote
minded
not
his
own
business
and
restrained
not
his
anger
so
he
bit
a
locust
that
was
only
the
skin
of
one
with
a
stone
inside
and
all
his
descendants
have
inherited
his
broken
teeth
and
so
also
to
this
day
when
locusts
venture
out
on
a
sunny
morning
to
sing
a
song
it
is
not
infrequently
their
custom
to
protect
themselves
from
the
consequences
of
attracting
too
much
attention
by
skinning
themselves
and
leaving
their
counterparts
on
the
trees
thus
shortens
my
story
the
coyote
and
the
ravens
who
raced
their
eyes
long
long
ago
in
the
days
of
the
ancients
there
lived
in
hómaiakwin
or
the
cañon
of
the
cedars
a
coyote
doubtless
the
same
one
i
have
told
you
of
as
having
made
friends
with
the
woodpounder
bird
as
you
know
this
cañon
in
which
he
lived
is
below
the
high
eastern
cliff
of
face
mountain
this
coyote
was
out
walking
one
day
on
leaving
his
house
he
had
said
that
he
was
going
hunting
but
miserable
fellow
who
ever
knew
a
coyote
to
catch
anything
unless
it
were
a
or
a
or
a
locust
or
something
of
the
kind
so
you
may
depend
upon
it
he
was
out
walking
that
is
wandering
around
to
see
what
he
could
see
he
crossed
over
the
valley
northward
with
his
tail
dragging
along
in
an
indifferent
sort
of
a
way
until
he
came
to
the
place
on
thunder
mountain
called
where
the
shell
breastplate
hangs
he
climbed
up
the
and
along
the
terraces
at
the
base
of
the
cliff
and
thus
happened
to
get
toward
the
southeastern
corner
of
the
mountain
there
is
a
little
column
of
rock
with
a
round
top
to
it
standing
there
as
you
know
to
this
day
now
on
the
top
of
this
standing
rock
sat
two
old
ravens
racing
their
eyes
one
of
them
would
settle
himself
down
on
the
rock
and
point
with
his
beak
straight
off
across
the
valley
to
some
pinnacle
in
the
cliffs
of
the
opposite
mesa
then
he
would
say
to
his
companion
without
turning
his
head
at
all
you
see
that
rock
yonder
well
ahem
standing
rock
yonder
round
you
go
ye
my
eyes
and
come
then
he
would
lower
his
head
stiffen
his
neck
squeeze
his
eyelids
and
he
would
say
as
his
eyes
flew
out
of
their
sockets
and
sailed
away
toward
the
rock
like
two
streaks
of
lightning
reaching
which
they
would
go
round
it
and
come
back
toward
the
raven
and
as
they
were
coming
back
he
would
swell
up
his
throat
and
say
whereupon
his
eyes
would
slide
with
a
othlo
into
their
sockets
again
then
he
would
turn
toward
his
companion
and
swelling
up
his
throat
still
more
and
ducking
his
head
just
as
if
he
were
trying
to
vomit
his
own
neck
he
would
laugh
inordinately
and
the
other
would
laugh
with
him
bristling
up
all
the
feathers
on
his
body
then
the
other
one
would
settle
himself
and
say
ah
i
ll
better
you
you
see
that
rock
away
yonder
then
he
would
begin
to
squeeze
his
eyelids
and
his
eyes
would
fly
out
of
their
sockets
and
away
across
the
mesa
and
round
the
rock
he
had
named
and
as
they
flew
back
he
would
lower
himself
and
say
when
othlo
the
eyes
would
slide
into
their
sockets
again
then
as
much
amused
as
ever
the
ravens
would
laugh
at
one
another
again
now
the
coyote
heard
the
ravens
humming
their
eyes
back
into
their
sockets
and
the
sound
they
made
as
well
as
the
way
they
laughed
so
heartily
exceedingly
pleased
him
so
that
he
stuck
his
tail
up
very
straight
and
laughed
merely
from
seeing
them
laugh
presently
he
could
contain
himself
no
longer
friends
he
cried
in
a
shrieky
little
voice
i
say
friends
how
do
you
do
and
what
are
you
doing
the
ravens
looked
down
and
when
they
saw
the
coyote
they
laughed
and
punched
one
another
with
their
wings
and
cried
out
to
him
bless
you
glad
to
see
you
come
what
is
it
you
are
doing
asked
he
by
the
daylight
of
the
gods
it
is
funny
whatever
it
is
and
he
whisked
his
tail
and
laughed
as
he
said
this
drawing
nearer
to
the
ravens
why
we
are
racing
our
eyes
said
the
older
of
the
two
ravens
didn
t
you
ever
see
anyone
race
his
eyes
before
good
demons
no
exclaimed
the
coyote
race
your
eyes
how
in
the
world
do
you
race
your
eyes
why
this
way
said
one
of
the
ravens
and
he
settled
himself
down
do
you
see
that
tall
rock
yonder
ahem
well
tall
rock
yonder
ye
my
eyes
go
round
it
and
return
to
me
othlo
k
othlo
the
eyes
slipped
out
of
their
sockets
and
the
raven
holding
his
head
perfectly
still
waited
with
his
upper
lids
hanging
wrinkled
on
his
lower
for
the
return
of
the
eyes
and
as
they
neared
him
he
crouched
down
swelled
up
his
neck
and
exclaimed
the
eyes
flew
into
their
sockets
again
then
the
raven
turned
around
and
showed
his
two
black
bright
eyes
as
good
as
ever
there
now
what
did
i
tell
you
by
the
moon
squeaked
the
coyote
and
came
up
nearer
still
how
in
the
world
do
you
do
that
it
is
one
of
the
most
wonderful
and
funny
things
i
ever
saw
well
here
come
up
close
to
me
said
the
raven
and
i
will
show
you
how
it
is
then
the
other
raven
settled
himself
down
and
went
his
eyes
out
of
their
sockets
round
a
rock
still
farther
away
and
as
they
returned
he
exclaimed
when
in
again
they
came
and
he
turned
around
laughing
at
the
coyote
there
now
said
he
didn
t
i
tell
you
by
the
daylight
of
the
gods
i
wish
i
could
do
that
said
the
coyote
suppose
i
try
my
eyes
why
yes
if
you
like
to
be
sure
said
the
ravens
well
now
do
you
want
to
try
humph
i
should
say
i
did
replied
the
coyote
well
then
settle
down
right
here
on
this
rock
said
the
ravens
making
way
for
him
and
hold
your
head
out
toward
that
rock
and
say
yonder
rock
these
my
eyes
go
round
it
and
return
to
i
know
i
know
i
know
yelled
the
coyote
and
he
settled
himself
down
and
squeezed
and
groaned
to
force
his
eyes
out
of
his
sockets
but
they
would
not
go
goodness
said
the
coyote
how
can
i
get
my
eyes
to
go
out
of
their
sockets
why
don
t
you
know
how
said
the
ravens
well
just
keep
still
and
we
ll
help
you
we
ll
take
them
out
for
all
right
all
right
cried
the
coyote
unable
to
repress
his
impatience
quick
quick
here
i
am
all
ready
and
crouching
down
he
laid
his
tail
straight
out
swelled
up
his
neck
and
strained
with
every
muscle
to
force
his
eyes
out
of
his
head
the
ravens
picked
them
out
with
a
dexterous
twist
of
their
beaks
in
no
time
and
sent
them
flying
off
over
the
valley
the
coyote
yelped
a
little
when
they
came
out
but
stood
his
ground
manfully
and
cringed
down
his
neck
and
waited
for
his
eyes
to
come
back
let
the
fool
of
a
beast
go
without
his
eyes
said
the
ravens
he
was
so
very
anxious
to
get
rid
of
them
and
do
something
he
had
no
business
with
let
him
go
without
them
whereupon
they
flew
off
across
the
valley
and
caught
up
his
eyes
and
ate
them
and
flew
on
laughing
at
the
predicament
in
which
they
had
left
the
coyote
now
thus
the
coyote
sat
there
the
proper
length
of
time
then
he
opened
his
mouth
and
said
but
he
waited
in
vain
for
his
eyes
to
come
back
and
he
said
again
no
use
mercy
exclaimed
he
what
can
have
become
of
my
eyes
why
don
t
they
come
back
after
he
had
waited
and
until
he
was
tired
he
concluded
that
his
eyes
had
got
lost
and
laid
his
head
on
his
breast
wofully
thinking
of
his
misfortune
how
in
the
world
shall
i
hunt
up
my
eyes
he
groaned
as
he
lifted
himself
cautiously
for
it
must
be
remembered
that
he
stood
on
a
narrow
rock
and
tried
to
look
all
around
but
he
couldn
t
see
then
he
began
to
feel
with
his
paws
one
after
another
to
find
the
way
down
and
he
slipped
and
fell
so
that
nearly
all
the
breath
was
knocked
out
of
his
body
when
he
had
recovered
he
picked
himself
up
and
felt
and
felt
along
slowly
descending
until
he
got
into
the
valley
now
it
happened
as
he
felt
his
way
along
with
his
toes
that
he
came
to
a
wet
place
in
the
valley
not
far
below
where
the
spring
of
shuntakaiya
flows
out
from
the
cliffs
above
in
feeling
his
way
his
foot
happened
to
strike
a
yellow
cranberry
ripe
and
soft
but
very
cold
of
course
ha
said
he
lucky
fellow
i
here
is
one
of
my
so
he
picked
it
up
and
clapped
it
into
one
of
his
empty
sockets
then
he
peered
up
to
the
sky
and
the
light
struck
through
it
didn
t
i
tell
you
so
old
fellow
it
is
one
of
your
eyes
by
the
souls
of
your
ancestors
then
he
felt
around
until
he
found
another
cranberry
ha
said
he
and
this
proves
it
here
is
the
other
and
he
clapped
that
into
the
other
empty
socket
he
didn
t
seem
to
see
quite
as
well
as
he
had
seen
before
but
still
the
cranberries
answered
the
purpose
of
eyes
exceedingly
well
and
the
poor
wretch
of
a
coyote
never
knew
the
difference
only
it
was
observed
when
he
returned
to
his
companions
in
the
cañon
of
the
cedars
that
he
had
yellow
eyes
instead
of
black
ones
which
everybody
knows
coyotes
and
all
other
creatures
had
at
first
thus
it
was
in
the
days
of
the
ancients
and
hence
to
this
day
coyotes
have
yellow
eyes
and
are
not
always
quick
to
see
things
thus
shortens
my
story
the
and
their
priest
the
once
long
long
ago
there
stood
in
land
a
large
village
land
is
south
of
zuñi
beyond
grease
mountain
and
in
the
middle
of
that
country
which
is
one
of
our
smaller
meadows
stands
a
mountain
which
is
a
little
mound
all
round
about
the
base
of
this
mountain
were
the
and
and
pathways
of
the
grandfathers
of
the
in
the
very
top
of
the
mount
was
the
house
of
an
old
and
his
wife
one
summer
it
rained
and
it
rained
and
it
rained
so
that
the
fine
fields
of
wild
portulaca
were
kept
constantly
fresh
and
the
had
unfailing
supplies
of
this
their
favorite
food
they
became
fat
and
happy
and
gloried
in
the
that
had
produced
such
an
abundant
harvest
for
them
but
still
it
kept
raining
until
when
they
descended
to
their
fields
of
they
found
their
feet
were
wet
which
they
did
not
like
any
more
than
like
it
today
now
you
know
that
in
some
parts
of
the
meadow
of
land
are
little
hollows
in
which
the
water
collects
when
it
rains
hard
just
in
these
places
were
the
fields
of
and
still
it
rained
and
rained
until
finally
only
the
tops
of
the
plants
appeared
above
the
waters
then
the
began
to
curse
the
rain
and
to
fall
off
in
flesh
for
they
could
no
longer
go
to
the
fields
to
collect
food
and
the
stores
in
their
granaries
were
running
low
at
last
they
grew
very
hungry
and
lean
and
could
hardly
get
about
for
it
rained
and
rained
day
after
day
so
that
they
dare
not
go
away
from
their
holes
and
their
stores
were
all
gone
the
old
ones
among
the
the
grandfathers
called
a
great
council
three
or
four
of
them
came
out
of
their
houses
stood
up
on
the
mounds
in
front
of
their
and
called
out
wek
wek
wek
wek
wek
wek
wek
in
shrill
squeaky
voices
so
that
the
women
and
children
in
the
holes
round
about
exclaimed
goodness
gracious
the
old
ones
are
calling
a
council
and
everybody
trooped
to
the
council
which
was
gathered
round
the
base
of
the
s
mountain
now
said
the
chief
spokesman
or
counsellor
you
see
those
wretched
rainers
keep
dropping
water
until
our
fields
of
are
flooded
they
ought
to
know
that
we
are
short
of
leg
and
that
we
can
t
go
into
the
lakes
to
gather
food
and
here
we
are
starving
our
women
are
dying
our
children
are
crying
and
we
can
scarcely
go
from
door
to
door
now
what
is
to
be
done
how
can
we
stop
the
rain
that
is
the
they
talked
and
talked
they
devised
many
plans
which
were
considered
futile
most
of
them
having
been
tried
already
at
last
a
wise
old
fellow
suggested
that
it
would
be
well
to
apply
to
their
grandfather
the
who
lived
in
the
top
of
the
mountain
hear
hear
cried
the
council
in
one
voice
whereupon
the
old
man
who
had
spoken
was
chosen
as
messenger
to
the
he
climbed
to
the
top
of
the
mountain
with
many
a
rest
and
at
last
got
near
the
doorway
and
sitting
down
at
a
respectful
distance
raised
himself
on
his
haunches
folded
his
hands
across
his
breast
then
cried
out
wek
wek
wek
the
old
grandfather
not
in
very
good
humor
stepped
out
blinking
his
eyes
and
asked
what
was
the
matter
he
said
it
isn
t
your
custom
to
come
up
to
my
house
and
make
such
a
racket
though
true
enough
it
is
that
i
hear
your
rackets
down
below
it
can
not
be
for
nothing
that
you
come
therefore
what
is
your
message
my
grandfather
said
the
in
council
we
have
considered
how
to
stop
the
irrepressible
rainers
but
all
of
our
efforts
and
devices
are
quite
futile
so
that
we
are
forced
to
apply
to
ah
indeed
said
the
old
owl
scratching
the
corner
of
his
eye
with
his
claw
go
down
home
and
i
will
see
what
i
can
do
tomorrow
morning
as
you
all
know
very
well
i
am
a
priest
i
will
set
aside
four
days
for
fasting
and
meditation
and
sacred
labors
please
await
the
the
old
humbly
bade
him
farewell
and
departed
for
his
village
below
next
morning
the
said
to
his
wife
put
on
a
large
quantity
of
beans
my
old
one
and
cook
them
well
small
beans
of
the
kind
that
smell
not
he
then
bade
her
good
morning
and
left
he
went
about
for
a
long
time
hunting
at
the
roots
of
bushes
at
last
he
found
one
of
those
beetles
with
its
head
stuck
way
down
in
the
midst
of
the
roots
he
grabbed
him
up
notwithstanding
the
poor
creature
s
remonstrances
and
took
him
home
when
he
arrived
there
said
he
my
friend
it
seems
to
me
you
are
making
a
great
fuss
about
this
thing
but
i
am
not
going
to
hurt
you
except
in
one
way
by
the
presentation
to
you
of
all
the
food
you
can
bless
me
said
the
bobbing
his
head
down
into
the
ground
and
rearing
himself
into
the
air
then
he
sat
down
quite
relieved
and
contented
old
woman
said
the
lay
out
a
dish
of
the
beans
on
the
the
wife
complied
my
friend
said
the
to
the
fall
to
and
satisfy
the
with
another
tip
sat
down
before
the
bowl
of
beans
he
ate
and
swallowed
and
gulped
until
he
had
entirely
emptied
the
dish
and
began
to
grow
rather
full
of
girth
not
yet
satisfied
asked
the
owl
old
woman
lay
out
another
another
large
bowl
of
the
bean
soup
was
placed
before
the
who
likewise
gulped
and
gulped
at
this
and
at
last
diminished
it
to
nothing
now
the
by
this
time
looked
like
a
paunch
still
when
the
old
owl
remarked
is
there
left
of
your
capacity
he
replied
somewhat
by
the
favor
of
a
little
more
i
think
i
shall
be
old
woman
said
the
owl
a
little
the
old
woman
placed
another
bowl
before
the
and
he
ate
and
ate
and
swallowed
and
swallowed
and
gulped
and
sputtered
but
with
all
the
standing
up
and
wiggling
of
his
head
that
he
could
do
he
could
not
finish
the
bowl
and
at
last
wiping
the
perspiration
from
his
brow
he
exclaimed
thanks
thanks
i
am
ha
indeed
said
the
owl
both
the
old
woman
and
the
had
noticed
while
the
feast
was
going
on
that
the
owl
had
cut
out
a
round
piece
of
buckskin
and
he
was
running
a
thread
round
about
the
edge
of
it
leaving
two
strings
at
either
side
like
the
strings
with
which
one
draws
together
a
pouch
just
as
the
returned
his
thanks
the
old
owl
had
finished
his
work
my
friend
said
he
turning
to
the
you
have
feasted
to
satisfaction
and
it
appears
to
me
by
your
motions
that
you
are
exceedingly
uncomfortable
being
larger
of
girth
than
is
safe
and
well
for
a
perhaps
you
are
not
aware
that
one
who
eats
freely
of
bean
soup
is
likely
to
grow
still
larger
i
would
advise
you
therefore
when
i
lay
this
pouch
on
the
floor
with
the
mouth
of
it
toward
you
to
run
your
head
into
it
and
exhale
as
much
wind
as
possible
and
to
facilitate
this
i
will
squeeze
you
the
was
not
very
well
pleased
with
the
proposition
still
he
by
no
means
refused
to
comply
you
see
continued
the
owl
you
are
at
once
to
be
relieved
of
the
serious
consequences
of
your
gluttony
while
at
the
same
time
paying
for
your
now
this
is
an
excellent
idea
upon
my
word
replied
the
and
forthwith
he
thrust
himself
into
the
bag
the
old
owl
embraced
the
and
gently
squeezed
him
increasing
the
pressure
as
time
went
on
until
a
large
amount
of
his
girth
had
been
diminished
but
behold
the
girth
of
the
bag
was
swelled
until
it
was
so
full
with
struggling
wind
that
it
could
hardly
be
tied
up
outside
the
rain
was
rattling
rattling
said
the
old
owl
to
the
my
friend
if
you
do
not
mind
the
rain
which
i
dare
say
you
do
not
you
may
now
return
to
your
home
many
thanks
for
your
the
likewise
with
expression
of
thanks
took
his
departure
when
the
morning
of
the
fourth
day
came
and
the
rain
still
continued
in
fact
increased
the
old
owl
took
the
bag
of
wind
out
to
the
mount
before
his
doorway
now
you
know
that
if
one
goes
near
a
and
disturbs
him
that
will
rear
himself
on
his
hands
and
head
and
disgorge
breath
of
so
pungent
a
nature
that
nobody
can
withstand
it
woe
to
the
nose
of
that
man
who
is
in
the
neighborhood
it
will
be
so
seared
with
this
odor
that
it
can
not
sneeze
though
desiring
never
so
much
to
do
so
you
know
also
if
you
touch
a
who
is
angry
all
the
good
water
in
zuñi
river
will
not
remove
from
your
fingers
the
memory
of
that
beetle
whenever
you
chance
to
smell
of
them
and
you
know
also
how
small
stewed
beans
with
thick
skins
affect
one
conceive
then
the
power
of
the
medicine
contained
in
that
little
bag
the
old
owl
taking
up
a
stick
hit
the
bag
one
whack
the
clouds
before
so
thick
glaring
with
lightning
trembling
and
swirling
with
thunder
now
began
to
thin
out
in
the
zenith
and
depart
and
the
sunlight
sifted
through
the
owl
hit
the
bag
another
stroke
behold
afar
off
scudded
the
clouds
as
before
a
fierce
blast
again
the
old
owl
hit
the
bag
the
clouds
were
resting
on
the
far
away
before
he
had
lowered
his
stick
then
with
one
mighty
effort
he
gave
the
bag
a
final
whack
wholly
emptying
it
of
its
contents
and
the
sky
was
as
clear
as
it
is
on
a
summer
s
day
in
the
of
a
drought
so
potent
was
this
and
irresistible
odor
that
even
the
themselves
could
not
withstand
it
and
withdrew
their
forces
and
retired
before
it
out
from
their
holes
trooped
the
and
sitting
up
on
their
haunches
all
round
about
the
mountain
they
shouted
at
the
tops
of
their
shrill
voices
wek
wek
wek
wek
wek
in
praise
of
their
great
priest
the
grandfather
behold
thus
it
was
in
the
days
of
the
ancients
and
for
that
reason
and
have
always
been
great
friends
and
the
consider
no
place
in
the
world
quite
so
appropriate
for
the
bringing
forth
hatching
and
rearing
of
their
children
as
the
holes
of
the
thus
shortens
my
story
illustration
across
the
terraces
of
zuñi
photo
by
vroman
how
the
gopher
raced
with
the
runners
of
k
iákime
there
was
a
time
in
the
days
of
the
ancients
when
the
runners
of
k
iákime
were
famed
above
those
of
all
other
cities
in
the
valley
of
shíwina
for
their
strength
endurance
and
swiftness
of
foot
in
running
the
or
race
they
overcame
one
after
another
the
runners
of
shíwina
or
zuñi
of
mátsaki
or
the
salt
city
of
pínawa
or
the
town
of
the
winds
and
in
fact
all
who
dared
to
challenge
them
or
to
accept
their
challenges
the
people
of
shíwina
and
mátsaki
did
not
give
up
easily
they
ran
again
and
again
only
to
be
beaten
and
to
lose
the
vast
piles
of
goods
and
precious
things
which
they
had
staked
or
bet
and
at
last
they
were
wholly
disheartened
and
bereft
of
everything
which
without
shame
a
man
might
exhibit
for
betting
so
the
people
of
the
two
towns
called
a
council
and
the
old
men
and
runners
gathered
and
discussed
what
could
be
done
that
the
runners
of
k
iákime
might
be
overcome
they
thought
of
all
the
wise
men
and
wise
beings
they
knew
of
one
after
another
of
them
was
mentioned
and
at
last
a
few
prevailed
in
contending
that
for
both
wisdom
and
cunning
or
craft
the
gopher
took
precedence
over
all
those
who
had
been
mentioned
forthwith
a
young
man
was
dispatched
to
find
an
old
gopher
who
lived
on
the
side
of
the
hill
near
which
the
began
he
was
out
sunning
himself
and
finishing
a
cellar
when
the
young
man
approached
him
and
he
called
out
ha
grandson
don
t
bother
me
this
morning
i
am
busy
digging
my
the
young
man
insisted
that
he
came
with
an
important
message
from
his
people
so
the
old
gopher
ceased
his
work
and
listened
attentively
while
the
young
man
related
to
him
the
difficulties
they
were
in
said
he
go
back
my
grandson
and
tell
your
people
to
challenge
the
runners
of
k
iákime
to
run
the
race
of
the
kicked
stick
with
a
runner
whom
they
have
chosen
a
single
one
the
fourth
day
from
this
day
and
tell
your
people
moreover
that
i
will
run
the
race
for
them
providing
only
that
the
runners
of
k
iákime
will
permit
me
to
go
my
own
way
on
my
own
road
which
as
you
know
runs
the
youth
thanked
the
old
gopher
and
was
about
to
retire
when
the
old
fellow
called
to
him
to
hold
on
a
little
mind
you
said
he
tell
your
people
also
that
they
shall
bet
for
me
only
two
things
red
paint
and
sacred
yellow
pollen
these
shall
as
it
were
be
the
payment
for
my
exertions
if
i
win
as
i
prize
this
sort
of
possession
above
all
the
young
man
returned
and
reported
what
the
gopher
had
said
thereupon
the
people
of
shíwina
and
mátsaki
sent
a
challenge
to
the
people
of
k
iákime
for
a
race
saying
we
bet
all
that
we
have
against
what
you
have
won
from
us
from
time
to
time
that
our
runner
the
gopher
who
lives
beside
the
beginning
of
our
will
beat
you
in
the
race
which
we
propose
shall
be
the
fourth
day
from
this
day
the
only
condition
we
name
is
that
the
gopher
shall
be
permitted
to
run
in
his
own
way
on
his
own
road
which
is
right
glad
were
the
runners
of
k
iákime
to
run
against
anyone
proposed
by
those
whom
they
had
so
often
beaten
they
hesitated
not
a
moment
in
replying
that
they
would
run
against
the
gopher
or
any
other
friend
of
the
people
of
mátsaki
and
shíwina
stipulating
only
that
the
gopher
if
he
ran
underground
should
appear
at
the
surface
occasionally
that
they
might
know
where
he
was
so
it
was
arranged
and
the
acceptance
of
the
challenge
was
reported
to
the
gopher
and
the
stipulation
also
which
was
named
by
the
runners
of
k
iákime
that
night
the
old
gopher
went
to
his
younger
brother
old
like
himself
and
dusty
with
diggings
of
his
cellars
my
younger
brother
said
the
old
gopher
the
fourth
day
from
this
day
i
am
to
run
a
race
i
shall
start
at
the
beginning
of
the
of
the
people
of
k
iákime
over
here
which
is
near
my
home
as
you
know
there
i
shall
dig
two
holes
one
at
the
beginning
of
the
the
other
a
little
farther
on
now
here
at
your
home
near
the
place
of
the
scratching
bushes
do
you
dig
a
hole
down
below
where
the
passes
your
place
off
to
one
side
of
it
and
another
hole
a
little
beyond
the
first
the
means
by
which
i
shall
be
distinguished
as
a
racer
will
be
a
red
plume
tied
to
my
head
do
you
also
procure
a
red
plume
and
tie
it
to
your
head
when
you
hear
the
thundering
of
the
feet
of
the
racers
run
out
and
show
yourself
for
a
minute
and
rush
into
the
other
hole
as
fast
as
you
i
understand
what
you
would
have
of
me
and
right
gladly
will
i
do
it
it
would
please
me
exceedingly
to
take
down
the
pride
of
those
haughty
runners
of
k
iákime
or
at
least
to
help
in
doing
it
replied
the
younger
brother
the
old
gopher
went
on
to
the
sitting
space
of
the
red
shell
where
dwelt
another
of
his
younger
brothers
precisely
like
himself
and
the
one
he
had
already
spoken
to
near
whose
home
the
also
ran
to
him
he
communicated
the
same
information
and
gave
the
same
directions
then
he
went
on
still
farther
to
the
place
called
k
ópak
yan
where
dwelt
another
of
his
younger
brothers
to
him
also
he
gave
the
same
directions
and
to
still
another
younger
brother
who
dwelt
beneath
the
base
of
the
two
broad
pillars
of
thunder
mountain
at
the
last
of
the
and
to
another
brother
who
dwelt
at
the
place
of
the
burnt
log
and
lastly
to
another
brother
quite
as
cunning
and
inventive
as
himself
who
dwelt
just
below
k
iákime
where
the
turned
toward
its
end
when
all
these
arrangements
had
been
made
the
old
gopher
went
back
and
settled
himself
comfortably
in
his
nest
bright
and
early
on
the
fourth
day
preparations
were
made
for
the
race
the
runners
of
k
iákime
had
been
fasting
and
training
in
the
sacred
houses
and
they
came
forth
stripped
and
begirt
for
the
racing
carrying
their
stick
then
came
the
people
of
mátsaki
and
shíwina
who
gathered
on
the
plain
and
there
they
waited
but
they
waited
not
long
for
soon
the
old
gopher
appeared
close
in
their
midst
popping
out
of
the
ground
and
on
his
head
was
a
little
red
plume
he
placed
the
stick
which
had
been
prepared
for
him
on
the
ground
where
he
could
grab
it
with
his
teeth
easily
saying
of
course
you
will
excuse
me
if
i
do
not
kick
my
stick
since
my
feet
are
so
short
that
i
could
not
do
so
on
the
other
hand
he
said
to
the
runners
you
do
not
have
to
dig
your
way
as
i
do
therefore
we
are
evenly
the
runners
of
k
iákime
contemptuously
laughing
asked
him
why
he
did
not
ask
for
some
privilege
instead
of
talking
about
things
which
meant
nothing
to
them
at
last
the
word
was
given
with
a
yell
and
a
spring
off
dashed
the
racers
of
k
iákime
gaily
kicking
their
stick
before
them
grabbing
his
stick
in
his
teeth
into
the
ground
plunged
the
old
gopher
fearful
lest
their
runner
should
be
beaten
the
people
of
shíwina
and
mátsaki
ran
to
a
neighboring
hill
watching
breathlessly
for
him
to
appear
somewhere
in
the
course
of
the
race
above
the
plain
away
over
the
plain
in
a
cloud
of
dust
swept
the
runners
of
k
iákime
they
were
already
far
off
when
suddenly
some
distance
before
them
out
of
the
ground
in
the
midst
of
the
popped
the
old
gopher
to
all
appearance
the
red
plume
dusty
but
waving
proudly
on
his
forehead
after
looking
round
at
the
runners
into
the
ground
he
plunged
again
the
people
of
shíwina
and
mátsaki
yelled
their
applause
the
runners
of
k
iákime
astounded
that
the
gopher
should
be
ahead
of
them
redoubled
their
efforts
when
they
came
near
the
place
of
the
red
shell
behold
somewhat
muddy
round
the
eyes
and
nose
out
popped
the
old
gopher
again
to
all
appearance
of
course
it
was
his
brother
the
red
plume
somewhat
heavy
with
dirt
but
still
waving
on
his
forehead
on
rushed
the
runners
and
they
had
no
sooner
neared
k
ópak
yan
than
again
they
saw
the
gopher
in
advance
of
them
now
apparently
covered
with
sweat
for
this
cunning
brother
had
provided
himself
with
a
little
water
which
he
rubbed
over
his
fur
and
made
it
all
muddy
as
though
he
were
perspiring
and
had
already
begun
to
grow
tired
he
came
out
of
his
hole
and
popped
into
the
other
less
quickly
than
the
others
had
done
and
the
runners
who
were
not
far
behind
him
raised
a
great
shout
and
pushed
ahead
when
they
thought
they
had
gained
on
him
behold
in
their
pathway
all
bedraggled
with
mud
apparently
the
same
old
gopher
appeared
moving
with
some
difficulty
and
then
disappeared
under
the
ground
again
and
so
on
the
runners
kept
seeing
the
gopher
at
intervals
each
time
a
little
worse
off
than
before
until
they
came
to
the
last
and
just
as
they
reached
it
almost
in
their
midst
appeared
the
most
bedraggled
and
worn
out
of
all
the
gophers
they
seeing
the
red
plume
on
his
crest
almost
obscured
by
mud
and
all
flattened
out
regarded
him
as
surely
the
same
old
gopher
finally
the
original
old
gopher
who
had
been
quietly
sleeping
meanwhile
roused
himself
and
besoaking
himself
from
the
tip
of
his
nose
to
the
end
of
his
short
tail
wallowed
about
in
the
dirt
until
he
was
well
plastered
with
mud
half
closing
his
eyes
and
crawled
out
before
the
astonished
multitude
at
the
end
of
the
goal
a
object
indeed
far
ahead
of
the
runners
who
were
rapidly
approaching
a
great
shout
was
raised
by
those
who
were
present
and
the
runners
of
k
iákime
for
the
first
time
lost
all
of
their
winnings
and
had
the
swiftness
or
at
least
all
their
confidence
taken
out
of
them
as
doth
the
wind
lose
its
swiftness
when
its
legs
are
broken
thus
it
was
in
the
days
of
the
ancients
by
the
skill
and
cunning
of
the
gopher
who
by
digging
his
many
holes
and
pitfalls
is
the
opponent
of
all
runners
great
and
small
was
the
race
won
against
the
swiftest
runners
among
the
youth
of
our
ancients
therefore
to
this
day
the
young
runners
of
zuñi
on
going
forth
to
prepare
for
a
race
take
with
them
the
sacred
yellow
pollen
and
red
paint
and
they
make
for
the
gophers
round
about
the
in
the
country
beautiful
little
plumes
and
they
speak
to
them
speeches
in
prayer
saying
behold
o
ye
gophers
of
the
plains
and
the
trails
we
race
and
that
we
may
have
thy
aid
we
give
ye
these
things
which
are
unto
ye
and
your
kind
most
precious
that
ye
will
cause
to
fall
into
your
holes
and
crannies
and
be
hidden
away
in
the
dark
and
the
dirt
the
sticks
that
are
kicked
by
our
thus
shortens
my
story
how
the
rattlesnakes
came
to
be
what
they
are
know
you
that
long
long
ago
there
lived
at
yathlpew
nan
as
live
there
now
many
rattlesnakes
but
then
they
were
men
and
women
only
of
a
rattlesnake
kind
one
day
the
little
children
of
one
of
the
houses
there
wished
to
go
out
to
play
at
sliding
down
the
south
of
the
bitter
pond
on
the
other
side
of
our
river
so
they
cried
out
to
their
parents
let
us
go
o
mother
grandmother
father
and
take
our
little
sister
to
play
on
the
sunny
side
of
the
my
children
said
the
mother
go
if
you
wish
but
be
very
careful
of
your
little
sister
for
she
is
young
carry
her
gently
on
your
shoulders
and
place
her
where
she
will
be
safe
for
she
is
very
small
and
oh
yes
cried
the
children
we
love
our
little
sister
don
t
we
little
one
said
they
turning
to
the
baby
girl
then
they
took
her
up
in
their
mantles
and
carried
her
on
their
shoulders
out
to
the
sunny
side
of
the
and
there
they
began
to
play
at
sliding
one
after
another
the
little
girl
immensely
delighted
with
their
sport
toddled
out
from
the
place
where
they
had
set
her
down
just
as
one
of
the
girls
was
speeding
down
the
side
of
the
the
little
creature
ran
clapping
her
hands
and
laughing
to
catch
her
sister
as
she
came
and
the
elder
one
trying
in
vain
to
stop
herself
called
out
to
her
to
beware
but
she
was
a
little
thing
and
knew
not
the
meaning
of
her
sister
s
warning
and
alas
the
elder
one
slid
down
upon
her
knocked
her
over
and
rolled
her
in
the
sand
crushing
her
so
that
she
died
and
rolling
her
out
very
small
the
children
all
gathered
around
their
little
sister
and
cried
and
cried
finally
they
took
her
up
tenderly
and
placing
her
on
their
shoulders
sang
as
they
went
slowly
toward
home
tsaaana
tsaaana
tsaaana
ma
hama
seta
ama
ma
hama
seta
rattlesnake
rattlesnake
rattlesnake
alas
we
bear
her
alas
we
bear
her
as
they
approached
the
village
of
the
rattlesnakes
the
mother
of
the
little
one
looked
out
and
saw
them
coming
and
heard
their
song
o
my
children
my
children
she
cried
ye
foolish
little
ones
did
i
not
tell
ye
to
beware
and
to
be
careful
o
my
children
then
she
exclaimed
rocking
herself
to
and
fro
and
wriggling
from
side
to
side
at
the
same
time
casting
her
hands
into
the
air
and
sobbing
wildly
mash
toki
ayaa
mash
toki
hai
i
i
i
i
and
fell
in
a
swoon
still
wriggling
to
the
ground
it
is
impossible
to
translate
this
exclamation
as
it
is
probably
archaic
and
it
is
certainly
the
intention
that
its
meaning
shall
not
be
plain
judging
from
its
etymology
i
should
think
that
its
meaning
might
be
oh
alas
our
little
maiden
oh
alas
our
little
maiden
when
the
old
grandmother
saw
them
coming
she
too
said
mash
toki
ayaa
mash
toki
hai
i
i
i
i
and
as
one
after
another
in
that
village
saw
the
little
child
so
beloved
brought
home
thus
mutilated
and
dead
each
cried
out
as
the
others
had
cried
mash
toki
ayaa
mash
toki
hai
i
i
i
i
and
all
swooned
away
and
the
children
also
who
were
bringing
the
little
one
joined
in
the
cry
of
woe
and
swooned
away
and
when
they
all
returned
to
life
behold
they
could
not
arise
but
went
wriggling
along
the
ground
faintly
crying
as
rattlesnakes
wriggle
and
cry
to
this
day
so
you
see
that
once
as
was
the
case
with
many
if
not
all
of
the
animals
the
rattlesnakes
were
a
people
and
a
splendid
people
too
therefore
we
kill
them
not
needlessly
nor
waste
the
lives
even
of
other
animals
without
cause
thus
shortens
my
story
how
the
were
ensnared
in
the
days
of
the
ancients
long
long
ago
there
lived
in
our
town
which
was
then
called
the
middle
ant
hill
of
the
world
a
proud
maiden
very
pretty
and
very
attractive
the
daughter
of
one
of
the
richest
men
among
our
people
she
had
every
possession
a
zuñi
maiden
could
wish
for
blankets
and
mantles
embroidered
dresses
and
sashes
buckskins
and
moccasins
turquoise
earrings
and
shell
necklaces
bracelets
so
many
you
could
not
count
them
she
had
her
father
and
mother
brothers
and
sisters
all
of
whom
she
loved
very
much
why
therefore
should
she
care
for
anything
else
there
was
only
one
thing
to
trouble
her
behold
it
came
of
much
possession
for
she
had
large
so
large
and
so
many
that
those
who
planted
and
worked
them
for
her
could
not
look
after
them
properly
and
no
sooner
had
the
corn
ears
become
full
and
sweet
with
the
milk
of
their
being
than
all
sorts
of
animals
broke
into
those
fields
and
pulled
down
the
and
ate
up
the
sweet
ears
of
corn
now
how
to
remove
this
difficulty
the
poor
girl
did
not
know
yes
now
that
i
think
of
it
there
was
another
thing
that
troubled
her
very
much
fully
as
much
as
did
the
pests
of
another
kind
however
for
there
wasn
t
an
unmarried
young
man
in
all
the
valley
of
our
ancients
who
was
not
running
mad
over
the
charms
of
this
girl
besides
all
that
not
a
few
of
them
had
an
eye
on
so
many
possessions
and
thought
her
home
wouldn
t
be
an
uncomfortable
place
to
live
in
so
they
never
gave
the
poor
girl
any
peace
but
hung
round
her
house
and
came
to
visit
her
father
so
constantly
that
at
last
she
determined
to
put
the
two
pests
together
and
call
them
one
and
thereby
get
rid
if
possible
of
one
or
the
other
so
when
these
young
men
were
very
importunate
she
would
say
to
them
look
you
if
any
one
of
you
will
go
to
my
and
destroy
or
scare
away
so
that
they
will
never
come
back
again
the
pests
that
eat
up
my
corn
him
i
will
marry
and
cherish
for
i
shall
respect
his
ability
and
the
young
men
tried
and
tried
but
it
was
of
no
use
before
long
everybody
knew
of
this
singular
proposition
there
was
a
young
fellow
who
lived
in
one
of
the
outer
towns
the
poorest
of
the
poor
among
our
people
and
not
only
that
but
he
was
so
ugly
that
no
woman
would
ever
look
at
him
without
laughing
now
there
are
two
kinds
of
laugh
with
women
one
of
them
is
a
very
good
sort
of
thing
and
makes
young
men
feel
happy
and
conceited
the
other
kind
is
somewhat
heartier
but
makes
young
men
feel
depressed
and
very
humble
it
need
not
be
asked
which
kind
was
laughed
by
the
women
when
they
saw
this
ugly
ragged
young
man
he
had
bright
twinkling
eyes
however
and
that
means
more
than
all
else
sometimes
now
this
young
man
came
to
hear
of
what
was
going
on
he
had
no
present
to
offer
the
girl
but
he
admired
her
as
much
as
yes
a
good
deal
more
than
if
he
had
been
the
handsomest
young
man
of
his
time
so
just
in
the
way
that
he
was
he
went
to
the
house
of
this
girl
one
evening
he
was
received
politely
and
it
was
noticeable
to
the
old
folks
that
the
girl
seemed
rather
to
like
him
just
as
it
is
noticeable
to
you
and
me
today
that
what
people
have
they
prize
less
than
what
they
have
not
the
girl
placed
a
tray
of
bread
before
the
young
man
and
bade
him
eat
and
after
he
had
done
he
looked
around
with
his
twinkling
little
eyes
and
the
old
man
said
let
us
smoke
and
so
they
smoked
the
old
man
asked
if
he
were
not
thinking
of
something
in
coming
to
the
house
of
a
stranger
and
the
young
man
replied
it
was
very
true
he
had
thoughts
though
he
felt
ashamed
to
say
it
but
he
even
wished
to
be
accepted
as
a
suitor
for
his
daughter
the
father
referred
the
matter
to
the
girl
and
she
said
she
would
be
very
well
satisfied
then
she
took
the
young
man
aside
and
spoke
a
few
words
to
him
in
fact
told
him
what
were
the
conditions
of
his
becoming
her
accepted
husband
he
smiled
and
said
he
would
certainly
try
to
the
best
of
his
ability
but
this
was
a
very
hard
thing
she
asked
i
know
it
is
said
the
girl
that
is
why
i
ask
now
the
young
man
left
the
house
forthwith
the
next
day
he
very
quietly
went
down
into
the
belonging
to
the
girl
and
over
toward
the
northern
mesa
for
that
is
where
her
were
lucky
being
he
dug
a
great
deep
pit
with
a
sharp
stick
and
a
bone
shovel
now
when
he
had
dug
it
very
smooth
at
the
sides
and
top
it
was
he
went
to
the
mountain
and
got
some
poles
placing
them
across
the
hole
and
over
these
poles
he
spread
earth
and
set
up
just
as
though
no
hole
had
been
dug
there
then
he
put
some
exceedingly
tempting
bait
plenty
of
it
over
the
center
of
these
poles
which
were
so
weak
that
nobody
however
light
of
foot
could
walk
over
them
without
breaking
through
night
came
on
and
you
could
hear
the
coyotes
begin
to
sing
and
the
whole
army
of
pests
bears
badgers
gophers
all
sorts
of
creatures
as
they
came
down
slowly
each
one
in
his
own
way
from
the
mountain
the
coyotes
first
came
into
the
field
being
swift
of
foot
and
one
of
them
nosing
around
and
keeping
a
sharp
lookout
for
watchers
happened
to
espy
those
wonderfully
tempting
morsels
that
lay
over
the
hole
ha
said
he
coyotes
don
t
think
much
what
they
are
doing
and
he
gave
a
leap
when
in
he
went
sticks
dirt
bait
and
all
to
the
bottom
of
the
hole
he
picked
himself
up
and
rubbed
the
sand
out
of
his
eyes
then
began
to
jump
and
jump
trying
to
get
out
but
it
was
of
no
use
and
he
set
up
a
most
doleful
howl
he
had
just
stopped
for
breath
when
a
bear
came
along
what
in
the
name
of
all
the
devils
and
witches
are
you
howling
so
for
said
he
where
are
you
the
coyote
swallowed
his
whimpers
immediately
set
himself
up
in
a
careless
attitude
and
cried
out
broadfoot
lucky
lucky
lucky
fellow
did
you
hear
me
singing
i
am
the
happiest
creature
on
the
face
of
the
earth
or
rather
under
what
about
i
shouldn
t
think
you
were
happy
to
judge
from
your
why
mercy
on
me
cried
the
coyote
i
was
singing
for
how
s
that
asked
the
bear
why
said
the
coyote
i
came
along
here
this
evening
and
by
the
merest
accident
fell
into
this
hole
and
what
do
you
suppose
i
found
down
here
meat
and
everything
a
could
wish
for
the
only
thing
i
lacked
to
complete
my
happiness
was
someone
to
enjoy
the
meal
with
me
jump
in
it
isn
t
very
deep
and
fall
to
friend
we
ll
have
a
jolly
good
night
of
so
the
old
bear
looked
down
drew
back
a
minute
hesitated
and
then
jumped
in
when
the
bear
got
down
there
the
coyote
laid
himself
back
slapped
his
thighs
and
laughed
and
laughed
and
laughed
now
get
out
if
you
can
said
he
to
the
bear
you
and
i
are
in
a
pretty
mess
i
fell
in
here
by
accident
it
is
true
but
i
would
give
my
teeth
and
eyes
if
i
could
get
out
again
the
bear
came
very
near
eating
him
up
but
the
coyote
whispered
something
in
his
ear
good
yelled
the
bear
ha
ha
ha
excellent
idea
let
us
sing
together
let
them
come
so
they
laughed
and
sang
and
feasted
until
they
attracted
almost
every
in
the
fields
to
the
spot
to
see
what
they
were
doing
keep
away
my
friends
cried
out
the
coyote
no
such
luck
for
you
we
got
here
first
our
spoils
can
t
i
come
can
t
i
come
cried
out
one
after
another
well
yes
no
there
may
not
be
enough
for
you
come
on
though
come
on
who
cares
cried
out
the
old
bear
and
they
rushed
in
so
fast
that
very
soon
the
was
almost
full
of
them
scrambling
to
get
ahead
of
one
another
and
before
they
knew
their
predicament
they
were
already
in
it
the
coyote
laughed
shuffled
around
and
screamed
at
the
top
of
his
voice
he
climbed
up
over
his
grandfather
the
bear
scrambled
through
the
others
which
were
snarling
and
biting
each
other
and
knowing
what
he
was
about
skipped
over
their
backs
out
of
the
hole
and
ran
away
laughing
as
hard
as
he
could
now
the
next
morning
down
to
the
came
the
young
man
drawing
near
to
the
pit
he
heard
a
tremendous
racket
and
going
to
the
edge
and
peering
in
he
saw
that
it
was
half
filled
with
the
pests
which
had
been
destroying
the
corn
of
the
maiden
every
kind
of
creature
that
had
ever
meddled
with
the
of
man
there
they
were
in
that
deep
pit
some
of
them
all
tired
out
waiting
for
the
end
of
their
daylight
others
still
jumping
and
crawling
and
falling
in
their
efforts
to
get
out
good
good
my
friends
cried
the
young
man
you
must
be
cold
i
ll
warm
you
up
a
so
he
gathered
a
quantity
of
dry
wood
and
threw
it
into
the
pit
be
patient
be
patient
said
he
i
hope
i
don
t
hurt
any
of
you
it
will
be
all
over
in
a
few
then
he
lighted
the
wood
and
burned
the
rascals
all
up
but
he
noticed
the
coyote
was
not
there
what
does
it
matter
said
he
one
kind
of
pest
a
man
can
fight
but
not
so
he
went
back
to
the
house
of
the
girl
and
reported
to
her
what
he
had
done
she
was
so
pleased
she
hardly
knew
how
to
express
her
gratitude
but
said
to
the
young
man
with
a
smile
on
her
face
and
a
twinkle
in
her
eye
are
you
quite
sure
they
were
all
there
why
they
were
all
there
except
the
coyote
said
the
young
man
but
i
must
tell
you
the
truth
and
somehow
he
got
out
or
didn
t
get
who
cares
for
a
coyote
said
the
girl
i
would
much
rather
marry
a
man
with
some
ingenuity
about
him
than
have
all
the
coyotes
in
the
world
to
whereupon
she
accepted
this
very
ugly
but
ingenious
young
man
and
it
is
notable
that
ever
since
then
pretty
girls
care
very
little
how
their
husbands
look
being
pretty
enough
themselves
for
both
but
they
like
to
have
them
able
to
think
and
guess
at
a
way
of
getting
along
occasionally
furthermore
what
does
a
rich
girl
care
for
a
rich
young
man
ever
since
then
even
to
this
day
as
you
know
rich
girls
almost
invariably
pick
out
poor
young
men
for
their
husbands
and
rich
young
men
are
sure
to
take
a
fancy
to
poor
girls
thus
it
was
in
the
days
of
the
ancients
the
coyote
got
out
of
the
trap
that
was
set
for
him
by
the
ugly
young
man
that
is
the
reason
why
coyotes
are
so
much
more
abundant
than
any
other
in
the
land
of
zuñi
and
do
what
you
will
they
are
sure
to
get
away
with
some
of
your
corn
anyhow
thus
shortens
my
story
illustration
frog
and
tadpoles
and
cottontail
anciently
the
lived
in
a
sage
plain
and
the
cottontail
rabbit
lived
in
a
cliff
hard
by
they
saw
the
clouds
gather
so
they
went
out
to
sing
the
sang
for
snow
thus

they

the
other
for

hence
to
this
day
the

runs
when
it

the
cottontail
when

thus
shortens
my
story
illustration
two
rabbits
the
rabbit
huntress
and
her
adventures
it
was
long
ago
in
the
days
of
the
ancients
that
a
poor
maiden
lived
at
k
yawana
little
gateway
of
zuñi
river
you
know
there
are
black
stone
walls
of
houses
standing
there
on
the
tops
of
the
cliffs
of
lava
above
the
narrow
place
through
which
the
river
runs
to
this
day
in
one
of
these
houses
there
lived
this
poor
maiden
alone
with
her
feeble
old
father
and
her
aged
mother
she
was
unmarried
and
her
brothers
had
all
been
killed
in
wars
or
had
died
gently
so
the
family
lived
there
helplessly
so
far
as
many
things
were
concerned
from
the
lack
of
men
in
their
house
it
is
true
that
in
making
the
gardens
the
little
plantings
of
beans
pumpkins
squashes
melons
and
corn
the
maiden
was
able
to
do
very
well
and
thus
mainly
on
the
products
of
these
things
the
family
were
supported
but
as
in
those
days
of
our
ancients
we
had
neither
sheep
nor
cattle
the
hunt
was
depended
upon
to
supply
the
meat
or
sometimes
it
was
procured
by
barter
of
the
products
of
the
fields
to
those
who
hunted
mostly
of
these
things
this
little
family
had
barely
enough
for
their
own
subsistence
hence
they
could
not
procure
their
supplies
of
meat
in
this
way
long
before
it
had
been
a
great
house
for
many
were
the
brave
and
strong
young
men
who
had
lived
in
it
but
the
rooms
were
now
empty
or
at
best
contained
only
the
leavings
of
those
who
had
lived
there
much
used
and
worn
out
one
autumn
day
near
snow
fell
and
it
became
very
cold
the
maiden
had
gathered
brush
and
firewood
in
abundance
and
it
was
piled
along
the
roof
of
the
house
and
down
underneath
the
ladder
which
descended
from
the
top
she
saw
the
young
men
issue
forth
the
next
morning
in
great
numbers
their
feet
protected
by
long
stockings
of
deerskin
the
fur
turned
inward
and
they
carried
on
their
shoulders
and
stuck
in
their
belts
stone
axes
and
as
she
gazed
at
them
from
the
roof
she
said
to
herself
o
that
i
were
a
man
and
could
go
forth
as
do
these
young
men
hunting
rabbits
then
my
poor
old
mother
and
father
would
not
lack
for
flesh
with
which
to
duly
season
their
food
and
nourish
their
lean
thus
ran
her
thoughts
and
before
night
as
she
saw
these
same
young
men
coming
in
one
after
another
some
of
them
bringing
long
strings
of
rabbits
others
short
ones
but
none
of
them
she
decided
that
woman
though
she
was
she
would
set
forth
on
the
morrow
to
try
what
luck
she
might
find
in
the
killing
of
rabbits
herself
it
may
seem
strange
that
although
this
maiden
was
beautiful
and
young
the
youths
did
not
give
her
some
of
their
rabbits
but
their
feelings
were
not
friendly
for
no
one
of
them
would
she
accept
as
a
husband
although
one
after
another
of
them
had
offered
himself
for
marriage
fully
resolved
the
girl
that
evening
sat
down
by
the
fireplace
and
turning
toward
her
aged
parents
said
o
my
mother
and
father
i
see
that
the
snow
has
fallen
whereby
easily
rabbits
are
tracked
and
the
young
men
who
went
out
this
morning
returned
long
before
evening
heavily
laden
with
strings
of
this
game
behold
in
the
other
rooms
of
our
house
are
many
and
there
hang
on
the
walls
stone
axes
and
with
these
i
might
perchance
strike
down
a
rabbit
on
his
trail
or
if
he
run
into
a
log
split
the
log
and
dig
him
out
so
i
have
thought
during
the
day
and
have
decided
to
go
tomorrow
and
try
my
fortunes
in
the
hunt
woman
though
i
my
daughter
quavered
the
feeble
old
mother
you
would
surely
be
very
cold
or
you
would
lose
your
way
or
grow
so
tired
that
you
could
not
return
before
night
and
you
must
not
go
out
to
hunt
rabbits
woman
as
you
why
certainly
not
insisted
the
old
man
rubbing
his
lean
knees
and
shaking
his
head
over
the
days
that
were
gone
no
no
let
us
live
in
poverty
rather
than
that
you
should
run
such
risks
as
these
o
my
but
say
what
they
would
the
girl
was
determined
and
the
old
man
said
at
last
very
well
you
will
not
be
turned
from
your
course
therefore
o
daughter
i
will
help
you
as
best
i
he
hobbled
into
another
room
and
found
there
some
old
deerskins
covered
thickly
with
fur
and
drawing
them
out
he
moistened
and
carefully
softened
them
and
cut
out
for
the
maiden
long
stockings
which
he
sewed
up
with
sinew
and
the
fiber
of
the
yucca
leaf
then
he
selected
for
her
from
among
the
old
possessions
of
his
brothers
and
sons
who
had
been
killed
or
perished
otherwise
a
number
of
and
a
fine
heavy
stone
axe
meanwhile
the
old
woman
busied
herself
in
preparing
a
lunch
for
the
girl
which
was
composed
of
little
cakes
of
spiced
with
pepper
and
wild
onions
pierced
through
the
middle
and
baked
in
the
ashes
when
she
had
made
a
long
string
of
these
by
threading
them
like
beads
on
a
rope
of
yucca
fiber
she
laid
them
down
not
far
from
the
ladder
on
a
little
bench
with
the
the
stone
axe
and
the
deerskin
stockings
that
night
the
maiden
planned
and
planned
and
early
on
the
following
morning
even
before
the
young
men
had
gone
out
from
the
town
she
had
put
on
a
warm
dress
knotted
a
mantle
over
her
shoulder
and
thrown
another
and
larger
one
over
her
back
drawn
on
the
deerskin
stockings
had
thrown
the
string
of
over
her
shoulder
stuck
the
in
her
belt
and
carrying
the
stone
axe
in
her
hand
sallied
forth
eastward
through
the
gateway
of
zuñi
and
into
the
plain
of
the
valley
beyond
called
the
plain
of
the
burnt
river
on
account
of
the
black
rocks
along
some
parts
of
its
sides
dazzlingly
white
the
snow
stretched
out
before
her
not
deep
but
unbroken
and
when
she
came
near
the
cliffs
with
many
little
cañons
in
them
along
the
northern
side
of
the
valley
she
saw
many
a
trail
of
rabbits
running
out
and
in
among
the
rocks
and
between
the
bushes
warm
and
excited
by
her
unwonted
exercise
she
did
not
heed
a
coming
but
ran
about
from
one
place
to
another
following
the
trails
of
the
rabbits
sometimes
up
into
the
cañons
where
the
forests
of
piñon
and
cedar
stood
and
where
here
and
there
she
had
the
good
fortune
sometimes
to
run
two
three
or
four
rabbits
into
a
single
hollow
log
it
was
little
work
to
split
these
logs
for
they
were
small
as
you
know
and
to
dig
out
the
rabbits
and
slay
them
by
a
blow
of
the
hand
on
the
nape
of
the
neck
back
of
the
ears
and
as
she
killed
each
rabbit
she
raised
it
reverently
to
her
lips
and
breathed
from
its
nostrils
its
expiring
breath
and
tying
its
legs
together
placed
it
on
the
string
which
after
a
while
began
to
grow
heavy
on
her
shoulders
still
she
kept
on
little
heeding
the
snow
which
was
falling
fast
nor
did
she
notice
that
it
was
growing
darker
and
darker
so
intent
was
she
on
the
hunt
and
so
glad
was
she
to
capture
so
many
rabbits
indeed
she
followed
the
trails
until
they
were
no
longer
visible
as
the
snow
fell
all
around
her
thinking
all
the
while
how
happy
will
be
my
poor
old
father
and
mother
that
they
shall
now
have
flesh
to
eat
how
strong
will
they
grow
and
when
this
meat
is
gone
that
which
is
dried
and
preserved
of
it
also
lo
another
will
no
doubt
come
and
i
can
go
out
hunting
at
last
the
twilight
came
and
looking
around
she
found
that
the
snow
had
fallen
deeply
there
was
no
trail
and
that
she
had
lost
her
way
true
she
turned
about
and
started
in
the
direction
of
her
home
as
she
supposed
walking
as
fast
as
she
could
through
the
soft
deep
snow
yet
she
reckoned
not
rightly
for
instead
of
going
eastward
along
the
valley
she
went
southward
across
it
and
entering
the
mouth
of
the
descending
plain
of
the
pines
she
went
on
and
on
thinking
she
was
going
homeward
until
at
last
it
grew
dark
and
she
knew
not
which
way
to
turn
what
harm
thought
she
if
i
find
a
sheltered
place
among
the
rocks
what
harm
if
i
remain
all
night
and
go
home
in
the
morning
when
the
snow
has
ceased
falling
and
by
the
light
i
shall
know
my
way
so
she
turned
about
to
some
rocks
which
appeared
black
and
dim
a
short
distance
away
fortunately
among
these
rocks
is
the
cave
which
is
known
as
taiuma
s
cave
this
she
came
to
and
peering
into
that
black
hole
she
saw
in
it
back
some
distance
a
little
glowing
light
ha
ha
thought
she
perhaps
some
like
myself
belated
yesterday
passed
the
night
here
and
left
the
fire
burning
if
so
this
is
greater
good
fortune
than
i
could
have
looked
so
lowering
the
string
of
rabbits
which
she
carried
on
her
shoulder
and
throwing
off
her
mantle
she
crawled
in
peering
well
into
the
darkness
for
fear
of
wild
beasts
then
returning
she
drew
in
the
string
of
rabbits
and
the
mantle
behold
there
was
a
bed
of
hot
coals
buried
in
the
ashes
in
the
very
middle
of
the
cave
and
piled
up
on
one
side
were
fragments
of
broken
wood
the
girl
happy
in
her
good
fortune
issued
forth
and
gathered
more
sticks
from
the
where
dead
piñons
are
found
in
great
numbers
and
bringing
them
in
little
armfuls
one
after
another
she
finally
succeeded
in
gathering
a
store
sufficient
to
keep
the
fire
burning
brightly
all
the
night
through
then
she
drew
off
her
stockings
of
deerskin
and
the
bedraggled
mantles
and
building
a
fire
hung
them
up
to
dry
and
sat
down
to
rest
herself
the
fire
burned
up
and
glowed
brightly
so
that
the
whole
cave
was
as
light
as
a
room
at
night
when
a
dance
is
being
celebrated
after
her
clothing
had
dried
she
spread
a
mantle
on
the
floor
of
the
cave
by
the
side
of
the
fire
and
sitting
down
dressed
one
of
her
rabbits
and
roasted
it
and
untying
the
string
of
her
mother
had
made
for
her
feasted
on
the
roasted
meat
and
cakes
she
had
just
finished
her
evening
meal
and
was
about
to
recline
and
watch
the
fire
for
awhile
when
she
heard
away
off
in
the
distance
a
long
low
cry
of
distress
ah
thought
the
girl
someone
more
belated
than
myself
is
lost
doubtless
one
of
the
she
got
up
and
went
nearer
to
the
entrance
of
the
cavern
sounded
the
cry
nearer
this
time
she
ran
out
and
as
it
was
repeated
again
she
placed
her
hand
to
her
mouth
and
cried
woman
though
she
was
as
loudly
as
possible
here
the
cry
was
repeated
near
at
hand
and
presently
the
maiden
listening
first
and
then
shouting
and
listening
again
heard
the
clatter
of
an
enormous
rattle
in
dismay
and
terror
she
threw
her
hands
into
the
air
and
crouching
down
rushed
into
the
cave
and
retreated
to
its
farthest
limits
where
she
sat
shuddering
with
fear
for
she
knew
that
one
of
the
cannibal
demons
of
those
days
perhaps
the
renowned
átahsaia
of
the
east
had
seen
the
light
of
her
fire
through
the
cave
entrance
with
his
terrible
staring
eyes
and
assuming
it
to
be
a
lost
wanderer
had
cried
out
and
so
led
her
to
guide
him
to
her
place
of
concealment
on
came
the
demon
snapping
the
twigs
under
his
feet
and
shouting
in
a
hoarse
loud
voice
lithlsh
tâ
ime
ho
there
so
you
are
in
here
are
you
clanged
his
rattle
while
almost
fainting
with
terror
closer
to
the
rock
crouched
the
maiden
the
old
demon
came
to
the
entrance
of
the
cave
and
bawled
out
i
am
cold
i
am
hungry
let
me
in
without
further
ado
he
stooped
and
tried
to
get
in
but
behold
the
entrance
was
too
small
for
his
giant
shoulders
to
pass
then
he
pretended
to
be
wonderfully
civil
and
said
come
out
and
bring
me
something
to
i
have
nothing
for
you
cried
the
maiden
i
have
eaten
my
have
you
no
rabbits
come
out
and
bring
me
some
of
but
the
maiden
was
so
terrified
that
she
dared
not
move
toward
the
entrance
throw
me
a
rabbit
shouted
the
old
demon
the
maiden
threw
him
one
of
her
precious
rabbits
at
last
when
she
could
rise
and
go
to
it
he
clutched
it
with
his
long
horny
hand
gave
one
gulp
and
swallowed
it
then
he
cried
out
throw
me
another
she
threw
him
another
which
he
also
immediately
swallowed
and
so
on
until
the
poor
maiden
had
thrown
all
the
rabbits
to
the
voracious
old
monster
every
one
she
threw
him
he
caught
in
his
huge
mouth
and
swallowed
hair
and
all
at
one
gulp
throw
me
another
cried
he
when
the
last
had
already
been
thrown
to
him
so
the
poor
maiden
was
forced
to
say
i
have
no
throw
me
your
overshoes
cried
he
she
threw
the
overshoes
of
deerskin
and
these
like
the
rabbits
he
speedily
devoured
then
he
called
for
her
moccasins
and
she
threw
them
for
her
belt
and
she
threw
it
and
finally
wonderful
to
tell
she
threw
even
her
mantle
and
blanket
and
her
overdress
until
behold
she
had
nothing
left
now
with
all
he
had
eaten
the
old
demon
was
swollen
hugely
at
the
stomach
and
though
he
tried
and
tried
to
squeeze
himself
through
the
mouth
of
the
cave
he
could
not
by
any
means
succeed
finally
lifting
his
great
flint
axe
he
began
to
shatter
the
rock
about
the
entrance
to
the
cave
and
slowly
but
surely
he
enlarged
the
hole
and
the
maiden
now
knew
that
as
soon
as
he
could
get
in
he
would
devour
her
also
and
she
almost
fainted
at
the
sickening
thought
pound
pound
pound
pound
went
the
great
axe
of
the
demon
as
he
struck
the
rocks
in
the
distance
the
two
were
sitting
in
their
home
at
the
shrine
amid
the
bushes
beyond
thunder
mountain
and
though
far
off
they
heard
thus
in
the
middle
of
the
night
the
pounding
of
the
demon
s
against
the
rocks
and
of
course
they
knew
at
once
that
a
poor
maiden
for
the
sake
of
her
father
and
mother
had
been
out
hunting
that
she
had
lost
her
way
and
finding
a
cave
where
there
was
a
little
fire
entered
it
rebuilt
the
fire
and
rested
herself
that
attracted
by
the
light
of
her
fire
the
cannibal
demon
had
come
and
besieged
her
retreat
and
only
a
little
time
hence
would
he
so
enlarge
the
entrance
to
the
cave
that
he
could
squeeze
even
his
great
paunch
through
it
and
come
at
the
maiden
to
destroy
her
so
catching
up
their
wonderful
weapons
these
two
flew
away
into
the
darkness
and
in
no
time
they
were
approaching
the
descending
plain
of
the
pines
just
as
the
demon
was
about
to
enter
the
cavern
and
the
maiden
had
fainted
at
seeing
his
huge
face
and
gray
shock
of
hair
and
staring
eyes
his
yellow
protruding
tusks
and
his
horny
taloned
hand
they
came
upon
the
old
beast
and
each
one
hitting
him
a
welt
with
his
they
ended
his
daylight
and
then
hauled
him
forth
into
the
open
space
they
opened
his
huge
paunch
and
withdrew
from
it
the
maiden
s
garments
and
even
the
rabbits
which
had
been
slain
the
rabbits
they
cast
away
amongst
the
plants
that
grew
on
the
slope
at
the
foot
of
the
cliff
the
garments
they
spread
out
on
the
snow
and
by
their
knowledge
cleansed
and
made
them
perfect
even
more
perfect
than
they
had
been
before
then
flinging
the
huge
body
of
the
giant
demon
down
into
the
depths
of
the
cañon
they
turned
them
about
and
calling
out
gentle
words
to
the
maiden
entered
and
restored
her
and
she
seeing
in
them
not
their
usual
ugly
persons
but
handsome
youths
as
like
to
one
another
as
are
two
deer
born
of
the
same
mother
was
greatly
comforted
and
bending
low
and
breathing
upon
their
hands
thanked
them
over
and
over
for
the
rescue
they
had
brought
her
but
she
crouched
herself
low
with
shame
that
her
garments
were
but
few
when
behold
the
youths
went
out
and
brought
in
to
her
the
garments
they
had
cleaned
by
their
knowledge
restoring
them
to
her
then
spreading
their
mantles
by
the
door
of
the
cave
they
slept
there
that
night
in
order
to
protect
the
maiden
and
on
the
morrow
wakened
her
they
told
her
many
things
and
showed
her
many
things
which
she
had
not
known
before
and
counselled
her
thus
it
is
not
fearful
that
a
maiden
should
marry
therefore
o
maiden
return
unto
thy
people
in
the
village
of
the
gateway
of
the
river
of
zuñi
this
morning
we
will
slay
rabbits
unnumbered
for
you
and
start
you
on
your
way
guarding
you
down
the
valley
and
when
you
are
in
sight
of
your
home
we
will
leave
you
telling
you
our
so
early
in
the
morning
the
two
gods
went
forth
and
flinging
their
sticks
among
the
plants
behold
as
though
the
plants
were
rabbits
so
many
lay
killed
on
the
snow
before
these
mighty
hunters
and
they
gathered
together
great
numbers
of
these
rabbits
a
string
for
each
one
of
the
party
and
when
the
sun
had
risen
clearer
in
the
sky
and
his
light
sparkled
on
the
snow
around
them
they
took
the
rabbits
to
the
maiden
and
presented
them
saying
we
will
carry
each
one
of
us
a
string
of
these
then
taking
her
hand
they
led
her
out
of
the
cave
and
down
the
valley
until
beyond
on
the
high
black
mesas
at
the
gateway
of
the
river
of
zuñi
she
saw
the
smoke
rise
from
the
houses
of
her
village
then
turned
the
two
to
her
and
they
told
her
their
names
and
again
she
bent
low
and
breathed
on
their
hands
then
dropping
the
strings
of
rabbits
which
they
had
carried
close
beside
the
maiden
they
swiftly
disappeared
thinking
much
of
all
she
had
learned
she
continued
her
way
to
the
home
of
her
father
and
mother
and
as
she
went
into
the
town
staggering
under
her
load
of
rabbits
the
young
men
and
the
old
men
and
women
and
children
beheld
her
with
wonder
and
no
hunter
in
that
town
thought
of
comparing
himself
with
the
maiden
huntress
of
k
yawana
the
old
man
and
the
old
woman
who
had
mourned
the
night
through
and
sat
up
anxiously
watching
were
overcome
with
happiness
when
they
saw
their
daughter
returning
and
as
she
laid
the
rabbits
at
their
feet
she
said
behold
my
father
and
my
mother
foolish
have
i
been
and
much
danger
have
i
passed
through
because
i
forgot
the
ways
of
a
woman
and
assumed
the
ways
of
a
man
but
two
wondrous
youths
have
taught
me
that
a
woman
may
be
a
huntress
and
yet
never
leave
her
own
fireside
behold
i
will
marry
when
some
good
youth
comes
to
me
and
he
will
hunt
rabbits
and
deer
for
me
for
my
parents
and
my
so
one
day
when
one
of
those
youths
who
had
seen
her
come
in
laden
with
rabbits
and
who
had
admired
her
time
out
of
mind
presented
himself
with
a
bundle
at
the
maiden
s
fireside
behold
she
smilingly
and
delightedly
accepted
him
and
from
that
day
to
this
when
women
would
hunt
rabbits
or
deer
they
marry
and
behold
the
rabbits
and
deer
are
hunted
thus
shortens
my
story
the
ugly
wild
boy
who
drove
the
bear
away
from
southeastern
mesa
in
the
days
of
the
ancients
there
lived
with
his
old
grandmother
not
far
from
k
iákime
east
where
the
sweet
is
pictured
on
the
rocks
a
frightfully
ugly
boy
the
color
of
his
body
and
face
was
blue
he
had
a
twisted
nose
crooked
scars
of
various
colors
ran
down
each
side
of
his
face
and
he
had
a
bunch
of
red
things
like
peppers
on
his
head
in
fact
in
all
ways
he
resembled
the
or
the
wild
men
of
the
sacred
dance
who
serve
as
runners
to
the
now
one
season
it
had
rained
so
much
that
the
piñon
trees
were
laden
with
nuts
and
the
datilas
were
heavy
with
fruit
and
the
gray
grass
and
were
so
heavy
with
seeds
that
even
when
the
wind
did
not
blow
they
bent
as
if
in
a
breeze
in
vain
the
people
of
k
iákime
went
to
the
southeastern
mesa
where
the
nut
trees
and
datilas
and
grass
grew
they
could
not
gather
the
nuts
and
the
fruit
and
the
seeds
because
of
the
ugly
old
bear
who
claimed
the
country
and
its
products
for
his
own
and
waxed
fat
thereon
some
of
the
people
were
killed
by
him
others
were
maimed
and
all
the
rest
were
driven
away
one
day
the
ugly
little
boy
said
to
his
grandmother
o
grandmother
i
am
going
out
to

cried
the
boy
i

going
whereupon
he
went
he
followed
the
trail
called
the
road
of
the
pending
and
he
climbed
the
crooked
path
up
shoyakoskwe
southeastern
mesa
and
advanced
over
the
wide
plateau
no
sooner
had
he
begun
to
pluck
the
sweet
datila
fruit
and
eat
of
it
and
had
cracked
between
his
teeth
an
occasional
piñon
nut
than
snarled
the
old
bear
and
he
came
rushing
out
of
the
nearest
thicket
toward
the
boy
shoma

shouted
the
boy
friend
friend

i
came
to
make
a
bargain

d
like
to
know
why
i
shouldn

growled
the
bear
i
ll
tear
you
to
pieces
what
have
you
come
to
my
country
for
stealing
my
fruit
and
nuts
and
i
came
to
get
something
to
eat
replied
the
boy
you

i

i
will
let
you
pick

i
will
tear
you
to
pieces
said
the
bear
don

don
t
and
i
will
make
a
bargain
with
you
said
the
boy
who
should
talk
of
bargains
to
me
yelled
the
bear
cracking
a
small
to
pieces
with
his
paws
and
teeth
so
great
was
his
rage
these
things
are
no
more
yours
than
mine
said
the
boy
and
i
ll
prove
how
asked
the
bear
they
are
mine
they
are
not
yours
cried
the
boy
they
are
mine
i
tell
you
they
are
not
yours
replied
the
bear
they
are
mine
retorted
the
boy
and
so
they
might
have
wrangled
till
sunset
or
torn
one
another
into
pieces
had
it
not
been
for
a
suggestion
that
the
boy
made
look
here
i
ll
make
a
proposition
to
you
said
he
what
s
that
asked
the
bear
whoever
is
certain
of
his
rights
on
this
plateau
and
the
things
that
grow
on
it
must
prove
it
by
not
being
scared
by
anything
that
the
other
does
said
the
boy
ha
ha
laughed
the
bear
in
his
big
coarse
voice
that
is
a
good
plan
indeed
i
am
perfectly
willing
to
stand
the
well
now
one
of
us
must
run
away
and
hide
said
the
boy
and
then
the
other
must
come
on
him
unaware
in
some
way
and
frighten
him
if
he
all
right
said
the
bear
who
first
just
as
you
say
said
the
boy
well
then
i
will
try
you
first
said
the
bear
for
this
place
belongs
to
whereupon
he
turned
and
fled
into
the
thicket
and
the
boy
went
around
picking
datilas
and
eating
them
and
throwing
the
skins
away
presently
the
bear
came
rushing
out
of
the
thicket
snapping
the
trees
and
twigs
and
throwing
them
about
at
such
a
rate
that
you
would
have
thought
there
was
a
sandstorm
raging
through
the
forest
hai
yaau
ku
pekwia
nu
ha
ha
ha
haaaa
he
exclaimed
rushing
at
the
boy
from
the
rear
the
boy
stirred
never
so
much
as
a
leaf
only
kept
on
champing
his
datilas
again
the
bear
retired
and
again
he
came
rushing
forth
and
snarling
out
ha
ha
hu
hu
hu
in
a
terrific
voice
and
grabbed
the
boy
but
never
so
much
as
the
boy
s
heart
stirred
by
my
senses
exclaimed
the
bear
you
are
a
man
and
i
must
give
it
up
now
suppose
you
try
me
i
can
stand
as
much
frightening
as
you
and
unless
you
can
frighten
me
i
tell
you
you
must
keep
away
from
my
datila
and
piñon
then
the
boy
turned
on
his
heel
and
fled
away
toward
his
grandmother
s
house
singing
as
he
went
itoshlakyanaa
kuyaina
itoshlakyanaa
he
of
the
piñon
patch
frightened
shall
be
he
of
the
piñon
patch
frightened
shall
be
oh
shall
he
cried
his
grandmother
i
declare
i
am
surprised
to
see
you
come
back
alive
and
hurry
up
grandmother
said
the
boy
and
paint
me
as
frightfully
as
you
all
right
my
son
i
will
help
you
so
she
blackened
the
right
side
of
his
face
with
soot
and
painted
the
left
side
with
ashes
until
he
looked
like
a
veritable
demon
then
she
gave
him
a
stone
axe
of
ancient
time
and
magic
power
and
she
said
take
this
my
son
and
see
what
you
can
do
with
the
boy
ran
back
to
the
mountain
the
bear
was
wandering
around
eating
datilas
the
boy
suddenly
ran
toward
him
and
exclaimed
yaaaa
he
he
he
he
he
he
he
tooh
and
he
whacked
the
side
of
a
hollow
piñon
tree
with
his
axe
the
tree
was
shivered
with
a
thundering
noise
the
earth
shook
and
the
bear
jumped
as
if
he
had
been
struck
by
one
of
the
flying
splinters
then
recovering
himself
and
catching
sight
of
the
boy
he
exclaimed
what
a
fool
i
am
to
be
scared
by
that
little
wretch
of
a
boy
but
presently
seeing
the
boy
s
face
he
was
startled
again
and
exclaimed
by
my
eyes
the
death
demon
is
after
me
surely
again
the
boy
as
he
came
near
whacked
with
his
magic
axe
the
body
of
another
tree
calling
out
in
a
still
louder
voice
the
earth
shook
so
much
and
the
noise
was
so
thunderous
that
the
bear
sneezed
with
agitation
and
again
as
the
boy
came
still
nearer
once
more
he
struck
a
tree
a
tremendous
blow
and
again
the
earth
thundered
and
trembled
more
violently
than
ever
and
the
bear
almost
lost
his
senses
with
fright
and
thought
surely
the
corpse
demon
was
coming
this
time
when
for
the
fourth
time
the
boy
struck
a
tree
close
to
the
bear
the
old
fellow
was
thrown
violently
to
the
ground
with
the
heaving
of
the
earth
and
the
bellowing
of
the
sounds
that
issued
forth
picking
himself
up
as
fast
as
he
could
never
stopping
to
see
whether
it
was
a
boy
or
a
devil
he
fled
to
the
eastward
as
fast
as
his
legs
would
carry
him
and
as
he
heard
the
boy
following
him
he
never
stopped
until
he
reached
the
zuñi
mountains
there
said
the
boy
i
ll
chase
the
old
rogue
no
farther
he
s
been
living
all
these
years
on
the
mountain
where
more
fruit
and
nuts
and
grow
than
a
thousand
bears
could
eat
and
yet
he
s
never
let
so
much
as
a
single
soul
of
the
town
of
k
iákime
gather
a
then
the
boy
returned
to
his
grandmother
and
related
to
her
what
had
taken
place
go
said
she
and
tell
the
people
of
k
iákime
from
the
top
of
yonder
high
rock
that
those
who
wish
to
go
out
to
gather
and
datilas
and
piñon
nuts
need
fear
no
so
the
boy
went
out
and
mounting
the
high
rock
informed
and
directed
the
people
as
follows
ye
of
the
home
of
the
eagles
ye
do
i
now
inform
whomsoever
of
ye
would
gather
datilas
whomsoever
of
ye
would
gather
piñon
nuts
whomsoever
of
ye
would
gather
that
bread
may
be
made
hie
ye
over
the
mountains
and
gather
them
to
your
hearts
content
for
i
have
driven
the
bear
away
a
few
believed
in
what
the
boy
said
and
some
because
he
was
ugly
would
not
believe
it
and
would
not
go
and
thus
were
as
much
hindered
from
gathering
and
nuts
for
daily
food
as
if
the
bear
had
been
really
there
you
know
people
nowadays
are
often
frightened
by
such
a
kind
of
bear
as
this
thus
it
was
in
the
days
of
the
ancients
and
therefore
the
zuñi
mountains
to
this
day
are
filled
with
bears
but
they
rarely
descend
to
the
mesas
in
the
southwest
being
fully
convinced
from
the
experience
of
their
ancestor
that
the
corpse
demon
is
near
and
continues
to
lie
in
wait
for
them
and
our
people
go
over
the
mountains
as
they
will
even
women
and
children
and
gather
datila
fruit
piñon
nuts
and
without
hindrance
thus
shortens
my
story
the
revenge
of
the
two
brothers
on
the
háwikuhkwe
or
the
two
little
ones
and
their
turkeys
the
origin
of
the
priests
and
chiefs
of
the
dance
of
victory
this
term
refers
to
the
two
gods
of
war
áhaiyúta
and
mátsailéma
who
as
has
been
seen
in
previous
tales
were
accounted
immortal
twin
youths
of
small
size
long
long
ago
there
lived
on
twin
mountain
áhaiyúta
and
his
younger
brother
with
their
grandmother
they
had
a
large
flock
of
turkeys
of
which
they
were
very
fond
but
were
not
so
attentive
to
them
as
they
should
have
been
said
the
grandmother
to
the
boys
late
one
morning
let
your
poor
turkeys
out
for
they
will
starve
poor
birds
if
you
do
not
let
them
out
but
they
will
run
away
grandmother
said
the
two
boys
who
did
not
fancy
herding
them
much
of
the
time
why
should
they
run
away
asked
the
vexed
grandmother
who
had
a
sorry
enough
time
managing
the
two
heedless
boys
rest
assured
they
will
come
back
when
comes
for
such
is
their
so
the
twain
ran
down
and
reluctantly
let
their
turkeys
go
the
turkeys
were
many
dirty
old
hens
piping
youngsters
and
noisy
old
cocks
but
they
were
all
more
noisy
when
they
were
let
out
and
not
long
was
it
before
they
were
straying
far
beyond
the
border
of
woods
and
toward
háwikuh
not
long
after
noon
the
flock
of
turkeys
strolled
gobbling
and
chirping
into
the
valley
north
of
háwikuh
where
many
of
the
people
of
that
pueblo
had
some
young
men
who
were
resting
from
their
hoeing
heard
the
calls
of
the
turkeys
and
starting
up
saw
across
the
valley
a
larger
flock
than
they
had
ever
been
wont
to
find
of
course
they
were
crazy
they
started
up
and
ran
as
fast
as
they
could
toward
the
pueblo
calling
out
as
they
went
what
they
had
discovered
so
that
all
the
people
in
the
fields
began
to
gather
in
as
soon
as
they
came
within
the
pueblo
they
sought
out
the
priests
of
the
bow
and
told
them
what
they
had
discovered
háwikuh
or
aguico
of
the
spaniards
a
pueblo
now
in
ruins
across
the
valley
northwestward
from
ojo
caliente
the
southwestern
farming
town
of
the
zuñis
very
quickly
ran
the
priests
to
the
tops
of
the
houses
and
they
began
to
call
out
to
their
people
ye
we
would
this
day
make
wise
for
our
sons
tell
us
of
many
turkeys
in
the
valley
over
the
hill
so
hasten
ye
to
gather
together
good
bows
and
arrows
boomerangs
and
strings
that
ye
may
be
made
happy
and
add
unto
your
flocks
and
make
more
plentiful
the
plumes
in
your
feather
in
a
very
short
time
the
people
were
rushing
out
of
their
doorways
all
prepared
for
the
chase
and
they
ran
after
the
young
men
and
leaders
as
though
in
a
race
of
the
kicked
stick
now
the
and
grasses
grow
tall
to
this
day
in
the
valley
north
of
háwikuh
and
so
they
grew
in
the
days
long
long
ago
that
i
tell
of
it
thus
happened
that
the
poor
turkeys
who
were
racing
after
grasshoppers
and
peeping
and
calling
and
gobbling
did
not
know
that
the
háwikuh
people
were
after
them
until
they
heard
some
old
hens
calling
out
in
alarm
from
behind
even
then
they
were
unable
to
get
away
for
the
people
were
around
them
shouting
and
hurling
crooked
sticks
and
shooting
sharp
arrows
at
them
in
all
directions
soon
they
began
to
fall
on
every
side
especially
the
young
ones
who
so
tangled
their
legs
in
the
grasses
that
they
could
not
keep
up
with
their
mothers
and
were
easily
overtaken
by
the
hunters
of
háwikuh
and
the
old
hens
who
stayed
behind
to
look
after
the
young
ones
were
no
better
and
the
cocks
who
stayed
back
to
look
after
the
old
hens
were
even
worse
off
for
the
people
sought
them
most
because
their
feathers
were
so
much
brighter
so
it
happened
in
a
very
short
time
that
more
than
half
the
flock
were
killed
and
others
were
falling
when
a
started
as
fast
as
he
could
alone
toward
twin
mountain
it
was
growing
late
and
áhaiyúta
and
his
younger
brother
and
their
old
grandmother
were
on
top
of
their
house
shading
their
eyes
and
watching
for
the
return
of
the
turkeys
when
they
saw
the
solitary
young
coming
all
out
of
breath
and
his
wings
dragging
over
the
hill
below
master
cañon
ha
said
the
younger
brother
look
there
comes
a
and
what
is
he
shouting
jump
up
brother
jump
up
do
you
hear
that
a
a
called
the
turkey
so
that
they
could
just
hear
him
and
as
that
means
murder
murder
you
may
think
to
yourself
how
much
they
were
excited
but
they
were
not
so
much
alarmed
as
the
old
grandmother
for
said
they
one
to
the
other
it
is
nothing
but
a
youngster
anyway
and
they
are
always
more
scared
than
the
old
nevertheless
they
hastened
down
to
meet
him
and
as
they
approached
they
saw
that
he
was
terribly
frightened
so
they
anxiously
waited
until
he
breathed
more
easily
and
would
stand
still
then
they
asked
what
is
it
where
is
it
why
do
you
come
alone
crying
murder
murder
alas
my
fathers
exclaimed
the
turkey
alas
i
alone
am
left
to
tell
of
it
ere
i
left
they
were
thrown
down
all
around
who
did
this
angrily
demanded
the
boys
the
people
of
háwikuh
exclaimed
the
turkey
glancing
apprehensively
around
ha
we
shall
yet
win
back
our
loss
ejaculated
the
boys
to
one
another
and
then
they
turned
to
the
turkey
are
they
all
murdered
and
gone
they
asked
yes
alas
yes
i
alone
am
left
moaned
the
young
turkey
oh
no
broke
in
the
elder
brother
there
will
yet
many
return
for
this
is
but
a
and
surely
when
he
could
save
himself
others
and
older
ones
even
then
they
heard
some
of
the
turkeys
calling
to
one
another
out
of
breath
over
the
low
hills
didn
t
i
tell
you
exclaimed
áhaiyúta
and
they
started
toward
the
mountain
one
by
one
or
in
little
bunches
the
turkeys
came
fleeing
in
scared
weary
and
bedraggled
and
the
boys
knew
by
this
and
that
only
a
few
after
all
returned
that
the
had
not
been
for
nothing
taught
to
fear
they
betook
themselves
to
their
house
there
they
sat
down
to
eat
with
their
grandmother
and
after
the
eating
was
finished
they
poked
little
sticks
into
the
blazing
fire
on
the
hearth
and
cried
out
to
their
grandmother
tomorrow
grandmother
we
will
gather
foolish
foolish
boys
crooned
the
old
grandmother
aye
tomorrow
we
will
gather
sprouts
where
do
they
grow
thickest
and
straightest
grandmother
now
you
boys
had
better
let
sprouts
and
war
alone
retorted
the
grandmother
but
we
must
win
back
our
losing
cried
the
boys
with
so
much
vehemence
that
the
grandmother
only
shook
her
head
and
exclaimed
blood
strange
creatures
my
grandchildren
both
whereupon
the
two
boys
poked
one
the
other
and
laughed
well
added
the
grandmother
i
have
warned
you
now
act
your
own
thoughts
and
the
boys
looked
at
her
as
earnestly
as
though
they
knew
nothing
of
what
she
would
say
fine
warriors
indeed
who
do
not
know
where
to
look
for
but
if
you
will
go
sprouting
why
over
there
in
the
basin
are
plenty
of
sprouts
and
then
north
on
scale
ridge
grow
more
and
over
in
oak
cañon
are
fine
more
than
ten
boys
like
you
could
carry
and
above
here
around
great
mountain
are
other
kinds
and
everywhere
grow
sprouts
enough
if
people
weren
t
beasts
passing
understanding
and
what
s
more
i
could
tell
you
boys
something
to
your
advantage
if
you
would
ever
listen
to
your
old
grandmother
but
what
is
it
what
is
it
interrupted
the
boys
excitedly
just
as
if
they
knew
nothing
of
what
she
would
say
why
over
there
by
the
basin
lives
your
grandfather
who
s
that
who
s
that
interrupted
the
boys
again
i
ve
a
mind
not
to
tell
you
you
shameless
little
beasts
another
word
jerked
out
the
old
grandmother
sucking
her
lips
as
if
they
were
marrowbones
and
digging
into
the
pudding
she
was
stirring
as
though
it
were
alive
enough
to
be
killed
just
as
though
i
were
not
telling
you
as
fast
as
i
could
and
besides
anything
but
little
beasts
would
know
their
grandfather
why
the
of
course
one
of
the
which
is
named
the
rainbow
on
account
of
his
streaked
back
and
habit
of
bending
double
when
travelling
the
our
grandfather
indeed
persisted
the
boys
and
they
would
have
said
more
had
not
their
grandmother
getting
cross
raised
the
at
them
and
bid
them
shut
up
so
they
subsided
and
the
old
woman
continued
yes
your
grandfather
and
for
shame
you
may
sit
there
and
giggle
all
you
please
but
your
grandfather
the
is
a
great
warrior
i
can
tell
you
and
if
you
boys
will
go
sprouting
why
i
can
tell
you
you
will
fare
but
with
poverty
the
day
after
if
you
do
not
get
him
to
help
you
that
s
all
indeed
replied
the
boys
quite
respectfully
yes
that
i
tell
you
and
moresoever
over
there
beyond
at
the
wood
border
in
a
pond
is
your
other
grandfather
and
he
is
a
great
warrior
indeed
exclaimed
the
boys
as
though
they
did
not
know
that
already
also
yes
and
you
must
go
to
see
him
too
for
you
can
t
get
along
without
him
any
more
than
without
the
other
now
you
boys
go
to
sleep
for
you
will
want
to
get
up
very
early
in
the
morning
and
you
must
go
down
the
path
and
straight
over
the
little
hills
to
where
your
grandfathers
live
and
not
up
into
the
master
cañon
to
gather
your
sticks
for
if
you
do
you
will
forget
all
i
ve
told
you
you
are
creatures
who
pass
comprehension
you
two
grandchildren
of
so
the
two
boys
lay
down
in
the
corner
together
under
one
robe
like
a
man
and
his
wife
for
they
did
not
sleep
apart
like
our
boys
but
do
you
know
those
two
mischievous
boys
giggled
and
kicked
one
another
and
kept
turning
about
just
as
though
they
never
dreamed
of
the
morning
then
they
fell
to
quarrelling
about
who
could
turn
over
the
quicker
i
can
said
the
elder
brother
you
can
t
i
can
no
you
can
t
yes
i
can
and
i
ll
show
you
and
he
was
about
to
brace
himself
for
the
trial
when
the
old
grandmother
strode
over
with
her
lifting
it
in
the
air
with
her
usual
expression
of
blood
my
grandchildren
both
when
they
quieted
down
and
pretended
to
sleep
but
still
they
kept
giggling
and
trying
to
pull
the
cover
off
each
other
stop
that
gaping
and
fooling
will
you
and
go
to
sleep
you
nasty
little
cubs
cried
the
irritated
old
woman
and
laughing
outright
at
their
poor
old
grandmother
they
put
their
arms
around
each
other
and
fell
asleep
next
morning
the
sun
rose
till
he
shone
straight
over
the
mountain
but
still
the
two
boys
were
asleep
the
old
grandmother
had
gone
out
to
water
her
garden
and
now
she
was
sitting
on
the
shading
her
eyes
and
looking
down
the
trail
she
had
told
the
boys
to
follow
to
see
them
come
out
of
the
shadow
after
she
had
strained
her
poor
old
eyes
till
they
watered
she
grew
impatient
did
i
ever
see
such
boys
now
they
ve
gone
and
played
me
another
trick
they
ll
rue
their
pranks
some
then
she
thought
she
would
go
down
and
get
some
mush
for
breakfast
as
she
climbed
down
the
ladder
she
heard
a
tremendous
snoring
ho
ho
exclaimed
the
old
grandmother
and
striding
across
the
room
she
shook
the
boys
soundly
get
up
get
up
you
lazy
creatures
fine
sprouters
you
the
boys
rolled
over
rubbed
their
eyes
and
began
to
stretch
get
up
get
up
the
day
is
warmed
long
ago
fine
warriors
you
reiterated
the
old
woman
giving
them
another
shaking
the
boys
sat
up
stretched
gaped
rubbed
their
eyes
and
scratched
their
heads
the
dirtiest
little
fellows
ever
seen
but
they
were
only
making
believe
their
arms
were
crusty
with
dirt
and
their
hair
stood
out
like
down
on
a
wild
milkweed
after
a
and
yet
these
boys
were
the
handsomest
children
that
ever
lived
only
they
were
fooling
their
old
grandmother
you
see
you
d
better
be
down
at
the
spring
washing
your
eyes
at
sunrise
instead
of
scratching
your
heads
here
with
the
sun
shining
already
down
the
croaked
the
old
woman
what
is
the
sun
out
cried
the
boys
in
mock
surprise
but
they
knew
what
time
it
was
as
well
as
the
old
crone
did
out
i
should
say
it
was
you
boys
might
as
well
go
to
sleep
again
a
fine
bundle
of
sticks
you
could
get
today
with
the
sun
done
climbing
up
so
the
boys
pretended
to
be
in
a
great
hurry
and
grabbing
up
their
bows
and
quivers
never
stopped
to
half
dress
nor
heeded
the
old
woman
s
offer
of
food
but
were
jumping
down
the
crags
like
mountain
goats
before
the
old
woman
was
up
the
ladder
exclaimed
the
grandmother
these
beasts
that
cause
meditation
then
she
climbed
the
terrace
and
watched
and
watched
and
watched
but
the
boys
liked
nothing
better
than
to
worry
their
old
grandmother
so
they
ran
up
master
cañon
and
into
the
woods
and
so
across
to
basin
leaving
the
old
woman
to
look
as
she
would
groaned
the
old
woman
they
are
down
among
the
rocks
playing
fine
warriors
they
and
with
this
she
went
back
to
her
cooking
the
boys
came
to
the
edge
of
the
basin
where
the
pod
plant
grew
sure
enough
there
was
the
eating
leaves
as
though
he
were
dying
of
hunger
a
great
fat
fellow
as
big
as
the
boys
themselves
for
long
long
ago
in
the
days
i
tell
you
of
the
was
much
bigger
than
he
is
now
hold
on
said
the
younger
brother
let
s
frighten
the
old
so
they
sneaked
up
until
they
were
close
to
the
grandfather
and
then
they
began
to
tickle
him
with
a
stalk
amiwili
that
was
his
name
twitched
his
skin
and
bit
away
faster
and
faster
at
the
leaves
until
áhaiyúta
shouted
at
the
top
of
his
voice
which
made
the
old
man
jump
and
turn
back
so
quickly
that
he
would
have
broken
his
back
had
he
a
he
exclaimed
it
s
my
grandchildren
is
it
i
am
old
and
a
little
deaf
and
you
frightened
me
my
did
we
frighten
you
grandfather
that
s
too
bad
well
never
mind
we
ve
come
to
you
for
what
s
that
my
grandchildren
looking
out
of
his
yellow
eyes
as
though
he
were
very
wise
and
standing
up
on
his
head
and
tail
as
though
they
had
been
two
feet
why
you
see
said
the
boys
we
had
a
big
drove
of
turkeys
and
we
let
them
out
to
feed
yesterday
but
the
fools
got
too
near
háwikuh
and
the
people
there
killed
many
many
of
them
so
we
have
decided
to
get
back
our
winnings
and
even
the
game
with
them
the
shameless
beasts
ah
ha
exclaimed
old
amiwili
very
well
and
he
lay
down
on
his
belly
and
lifted
his
head
into
the
air
like
a
man
resting
on
his
elbows
ah
ha
said
he
with
a
wag
of
his
head
and
a
squint
of
his
goggle
ah
ha
very
well
i
ll
show
them
that
they
are
not
to
treat
my
grandchildren
like
that
i
m
a
warrior
every
direction
of
me
and
there
are
a
great
many
directions
when
i
get
angry
now
i
can
tell
you
i
m
just
made
to
use
up
life
said
he
with
another
swagger
of
his
head
listen
to
that
said
mátsailéma
to
his
brother
to
use
up
life
that
s
what
i
m
for
added
the
old
man
with
emphasis
i
ll
show
the
háwikuhkwe
will
you
come
to
the
council
asked
the
two
boys
swaggered
the
old
man
which
is
a
very
word
that
our
grandfathers
used
when
they
said
go
ye
but
before
so
the
boys
skipped
over
to
the
pool
at
the
wood
border
there
was
their
old
grandfather
the
turtle
with
his
eyes
squinted
up
paddling
round
in
the
scum
and
stretching
his
long
neck
up
to
bite
off
the
heads
of
the
let
s
have
some
fun
with
the
old
said
the
boys
to
one
another
just
you
hold
a
moment
brother
elder
said
mátsailéma
as
he
fitted
an
arrow
to
the
string
and
drew
it
clean
to
the
point
sang
the
arrow
as
it
struck
the
back
of
the
old
turtle
and
although
he
was
as
big
as
the
turtles
in
the
big
waters
of
the
world
now
are
the
force
and
fright
ducked
him
under
the
scum
like
a
chip
and
he
came
up
with
his
eyes
slimy
and
his
mouth
full
of
spittle
and
his
legs
flying
round
too
fast
to
be
counted
when
he
spied
the
two
boys
he
cursed
them
harder
than
their
grandmother
did
but
they
hardly
heard
him
for
their
arrow
glanced
upward
from
his
back
and
came
down
so
straight
that
they
had
to
run
for
their
lives
troublesome
little
beasts
who
never
knew
what
shame
nor
dignity
was
exclaimed
the
old
fellow
don
t
be
angry
with
us
grandpa
said
the
boys
you
must
be
deaf
for
we
called
and
called
to
you
but
you
only
paddled
round
and
ate
rushes
so
we
thought
we
would
fire
an
arrow
at
you
for
you
know
we
couldn
t
get
at
oh
that
s
it
well
what
may
my
grandchildren
be
thinking
of
in
thus
coming
to
see
me
it
can
not
be
for
nothing
reflected
the
old
man
as
he
twisted
his
head
up
toward
them
and
pushed
the
scum
with
his
tail
quite
true
grandfather
we
ve
started
out
sprouting
and
had
to
come
to
our
grandfather
for
why
what
is
it
then
queried
the
old
you
see
we
have
a
flock
of
turkeys
yes
i
know
interrupted
the
old
man
for
they
came
down
here
to
drink
yesterday
and
broke
my
morning
nap
with
their
quit
quittings
well
resumed
the
boys
they
went
toward
the
háwikuhkwe
and
the
shameless
beasts
that
they
are
turned
out
and
killed
very
nearly
all
of
them
and
we
re
going
to
even
matters
with
them
that
s
why
we
are
out
ah
ha
cried
the
old
man
paddling
up
nearer
to
the
bank
good
well
that
s
right
my
grandchildren
you
show
that
you
are
the
wise
boys
that
you
are
to
come
to
me
i
m
a
great
warrior
i
am
for
though
i
have
neither
bow
nor
arrow
yet
the
more
my
enemies
have
the
worse
for
themselves
that
s
all
you
two
just
wait
until
tomorrow
and
he
stretched
his
head
out
until
it
looked
as
though
he
kept
a
snake
in
his
shell
will
you
help
us
asked
the
boys
they
knew
very
well
he
would
like
nothing
better
of
course
my
will
you
come
to
the
council
of
course
my
grandchildren
two
how
many
will
be
there
called
the
old
fellow
the
house
shall
be
as
full
as
a
full
stomach
retorted
the
boys
jousting
each
other
gruffly
said
etawa
for
that
was
the
turtle
s
name
so
the
boys
started
for
cañon
and
arrived
there
soon
had
a
large
bundle
of
branches
cut
down
with
their
big
flint
knives
and
four
stout
dry
they
shouldered
their
sprouts
and
started
home
and
although
they
had
bundles
big
enough
to
almost
hide
them
they
trotted
along
as
though
they
had
nothing
on
their
way
they
picked
up
a
lot
of
obsidian
and
went
fast
enough
until
they
were
near
their
home
and
then
they
were
very
tired
so
tired
that
the
old
grandmother
when
she
caught
sight
of
them
pitied
them
and
hurried
down
to
stir
some
mush
for
them
she
buried
some
in
the
ashes
too
and
roasted
some
in
the
same
way
so
that
when
those
two
lying
little
rascals
came
up
and
seemed
so
she
hurried
so
fast
to
get
their
food
ready
that
it
made
her
sinews
twitch
when
the
boys
had
eaten
all
they
could
and
cracked
a
few
bones
they
fell
to
breaking
the
sprouts
they
worked
with
their
stone
chips
very
fast
and
soon
had
barked
all
they
wanted
these
they
straightened
by
passing
them
through
their
horns
and
placed
them
before
the
fire
while
the
shafts
were
drying
they
broke
up
the
obsidian
and
laying
chips
of
it
on
a
stone
covered
with
buckskin
quickly
fashioned
them
into
sharp
with
the
points
of
other
stones
and
these
they
fastened
to
the
ends
of
the
shafts
placing
feathers
of
the
eagle
on
the
other
ends
until
they
had
made
enough
for
four
big
bundles
then
they
made
a
bow
of
each
of
the
four
and
stood
them
up
to
dry
against
the
wall
fragments
of
horn
are
used
to
this
day
by
the
zuñis
for
the
same
purpose
they
are
flattened
by
heat
and
perforated
with
holes
of
varying
size
by
introducing
the
shaft
to
be
straightened
and
rubbing
with
a
twisting
motion
the
inner
sides
of
the
crooked
portions
they
are
gradually
straightened
out
afterward
to
be
straightened
by
hand
from
time
to
time
as
they
dry
before
the
fire
as
it
grew
dark
they
heard
something
like
a
dry
leaf
in
a
little
wind
ah
said
one
to
the
other
our
grandfather
comes
and
sure
enough
presently
amiwili
poked
his
yellow
eyes
in
at
the
door
but
quickly
drew
back
again
said
he
your
fire
is
fearful
it
scares
me
the
grandfather
cometh
exclaimed
the
boys
come
in
sit
very
well
ah
you
are
stretching
shafts
are
you
said
the
old
worm
crawling
around
behind
the
boys
and
into
the
darkest
corner
he
could
find
yes
replied
they
why
do
you
not
come
out
into
the
light
grandpa
i
fear
the
fire
it
hurts
my
eyes
and
makes
me
feel
as
the
sun
does
after
a
and
i
have
no
leaves
to
crawl
very
well
said
the
boys
grandmother
spread
a
robe
for
him
in
the
then
they
busied
themselves
straightening
some
of
the
arrows
and
trying
their
bows
just
as
they
were
pulling
one
toward
the
entrance
way
they
heard
old
etawa
thumping
along
and
immediately
the
old
fellow
called
out
hold
on
don
t
thump
me
against
one
of
those
sticks
of
yours
they
jar
a
fellow
so
oh
it
s
you
is
it
grandfather
well
we
re
only
trying
our
new
bows
come
in
and
sit
so
the
old
fellow
bumped
along
in
and
took
his
place
by
the
fire
for
he
did
not
care
whether
it
was
hot
or
cold
are
the
councillors
here
asked
he
wagging
his
head
around
why
certainly
said
the
two
boys
and
now
our
council
is
so
full
we
had
better
proceed
to
discuss
what
we
had
better
when
the
old
turtle
discovered
that
the
boys
had
been
playing
him
a
joke
he
was
vexed
but
he
didn
t
show
it
amiwili
here
asked
he
we
four
will
teach
those
háwikuhkwe
yes
indeed
croaked
the
well
said
the
boys
at
daybreak
tomorrow
morning
before
it
is
light

shall
start
for
very
well
responded
amiwili

my
place

added
etawa

my
place

to
my
house
as
fast
as
you

much
as
anybody
even
if
i
have
no
arrows
to
shoot
at
yes
added
the
and
when
you
come
up
to
my
house
just
run
past
me
and
i
ll
take
care
of
the
rest
of
them
i
m
made
to
use
up
life
i
am
swaggered
he
and
i
boasted
the
old
turtle
come
brother
let
us
be
going
for
we
have
a
long
way
to
travel
and
our
legs
are
so
after
feasting
the
two
started
away
as
soon
as
they
had
gone
the
two
boys
went
to
their
corner
and
lay
down
to
rest
first
filling
their
quivers
with
arrows
and
laying
their
out
on
the
floor
they
were
presently
quiet
and
then
began
to
snore
so
their
old
grandmother
went
into
another
room
and
brought
out
a
new
bowl
which
she
filled
with
water
then
she
retired
into
the
room
again
and
when
she
came
out
she
was
dressed
in
beautiful
embroidered
mantles
and
skirts
and
decorated
with
precious
ornaments
of
shell
and
turquoise
the
or
is
represented
in
modern
times
by
a
beautiful
netting
of
white
cotton
threads
strung
on
a
round
hoop
with
a
downy
plume
suspended
from
the
center
this
with
the
dealings
of
áhaiyúta
and
mátsailéma
with
arrows
of
lightning
and
the
simile
of
their
father
the
sun
leaves
little
doubt
that
they
are
in
common
with
mystic
creations
of
the
aryans
representatives
of
natural
phenomena
or
their
agents
this
is
even
more
closely
suggested
by
the
sequel
the
noise
she
made
awoke
áhaiyúta
who
punched
his
younger
brother
and
said
wake
up
wake
up
here
s
grandmother
dressed
as
though
she
were
going
to
a
dance
then
the
younger
brother
raised
his
voice
to
a
sharp
whisper
they
knew
perfectly
well
what
the
old
grandmother
was
intending
to
do
what
for
here
said
the
old
woman
turning
toward
the
bed
go
to
sleep
what
are
you
little
beasts
doing
now
for
shame
you
pretend
you
are
going
out
to
war
tomorrow
why
are
you
dressed
so
grandmother
ventured
the
younger
what
i
be
dressed
for
but
to
make
medicine
for
you
two
now
mind
you
must
not
watch
me
i
shall
make
the
medicine
and
place
it
in
these
two
cane
tubes
and
you
must
shoot
them
into
the
middle
of
the
plaza
of
háwikuh
as
soon
as
you
get
there
that
will
make
the
people
like
women
for
the
canes
will
break
and
make
the
medicine
fly
about
like
mist
and
whomsoever
gets
his
skin
wet
by
it
will
become
no
more
of
a
warrior
than
a
woman
go
to
sleep
i
say
you
pests
but
the
boys
had
no
intention
of
sleeping
to
be
sure
they
stretched
themselves
out
and
slyly
laid
their
arms
across
their
eyes
the
old
grandmother
did
not
notice
this
at
first
she
began
to
wash
her
arms
in
the
bowl
of
water
then
she
rubbed
them
so
hard
that
the
substance
of
flesh
was
rolled
off
in
little
lumps
and
fell
into
the
water
this
she
began
to
mix
carefully
with
the
water
when
áhaiyúta
whispered
to
the
other
brother
younger
just
look
old
grandmother
s
arms
look
as
bright
as
a
young
girl
s
look
look
said
he
still
louder
for
the
other
had
already
begun
to
giggle
but
when
the
old
woman
turned
to
talk
sharply
at
them
they
turned
over
the
rascals
as
dutifully
as
though
they
had
never
joked
with
their
poor
old
grandmother
soon
they
were
indeed
sleeping
then
the
grandmother
proceeded
to
fill
the
canes
with
the
fluid
and
then
she
fastened
these
to
the
ends
of
two
good
arrows
there
she
exclaimed
with
a
sigh
and
after
she
had
chanted
an
incantation
over
the
canes
she
laid
some
food
near
the
boys
and
softly
left
the
room
to
sleep
the
boys
never
minded
the
things
they
had
to
do
in
the
morning
but
slept
soundly
until
the
coming
of
day
when
they
arose
took
their
bows
and
quivers
knives
arrows
and
and
quietly
stole
away
it
was
not
long
ere
they
approached
the
house
of
amiwili
he
was
fairly
gorging
the
leaves
of
all
the
lizard
plants
he
could
lay
hold
of
and
already
looked
so
full
that
he
must
have
felt
like
a
ball
but
he
munched
away
so
busily
that
he
wouldn
t
have
looked
at
the
boys
had
it
been
light
enough
how
did
our
grandfather
come
unto
the
morning
asked
they
get
out
was
all
the
old
worm
vouchsafed
them
between
his
cuds
and
they
sped
on
soon
they
reached
the
home
of
the
old
turtle
this
old
grandfather
was
more
leisurely
you
will
return
at
the
height
of
the
sun
said
he
now
mind
what
i
told
you
last
night
i
ll
wait
right
here
on
the
bank
for
very
well
laughed
the
boys
for
little
they
cared
that
they
were
on
the
they
neared
the
town
of
háwikuh
it
was
twilight
for
the
morning
star
was
high
the
boys
sat
down
a
moment
and
sang
an
incantation
the
same
our
fathers
and
children
the
sing
now
then
the
younger
brother
ran
round
the
pueblo
to
scout
two
or
three
people
were
getting
up
as
he
could
see
for
nearly
everybody
slept
on
the
roofs
it
was
so
warm
cried
he
at
the
top
of
his
voice
and
as
the
people
were
rousing
he
drew
one
of
the
cane
arrows
full
length
in
his
bow
and
so
straight
and
high
did
he
shoot
that
it
fell
into
the
middle
of
the
plaza
splitting
and
scattering
in
every
direction
so
that
the
people
all
exclaimed
as
they
rubbed
their
eyes
ho
it
is
raining
and
yet
the
sky
is
clear
and
didn
t
some
one
cry
murder
murder
when
áhaiyúta
s
arrow
struck
it
scattered
more
upon
them
until
they
thought
they
must
be
dreaming
of
rain
but
just
then
mátsailéma
shouted
murder
again
and
everybody
started
to
hunt
bows
and
arrows
then
the
boy
ran
to
the
of
his
brother
in
the
grass
on
the
trail
toward
the
wood
border
and
just
as
he
got
there
some
of
the
people
who
were
shouting
and
gabbling
to
one
another
ran
out
to
see
him
ha
they
shouted
there
they
are
on
the
northern
so
the
háwikuhkwe
all
poured
down
toward
them
but
when
they
arrived
there
they
found
no
enemy
while
the
people
were
looking
and
running
about
and
and
the
arrows
of
áhaiyúta
and
mátsailéma
struck
the
nearest
ones
for
they
had
crawled
along
the
trail
and
were
waiting
in
the
grass
they
never
missed
every
man
they
struck
fell
but
many
many
came
on
and
when
these
saw
that
there
were
only
two
their
faces
were
all
the
more
to
the
front
with
haste
still
the
two
boys
shot
shot
shot
at
them
until
many
were
killed
or
wounded
before
the
remainder
decided
to
flee
come
brother
my
arrows
are
gone
said
the
younger
brother
quick
put
on
the
and
let
us
be
off
now
the
people
were
gaining
on
them
faster
and
faster
but
áhaiyúta
threw
water
like
thick
rain
from
his
shield
strapped
over
his
back
so
that
the
enemies
loosened
and
they
had
to
stop
to
tighten
them
again
and
again
whenever
the
háwikuhkwe
pressed
them
too
closely
the
sprinkled
them
so
thoroughly
that
when
they
nocked
an
arrow
the
sinew
stretched
like
gum
and
all
they
could
do
was
to
stop
and
tighten
their
again
thus
the
boys
were
able
to
near
the
home
of
their
grandfather
the
big
turtle
now
and
then
shooting
at
the
leaders
with
their
warring
arrows
and
rarely
missing
their
marks
but
as
they
came
near
the
people
were
gathering
more
and
more
thickly
in
their
rear
so
that
mátsailéma
barely
had
time
to
take
his
grandfather
who
was
waiting
on
the
bank
of
the
pond
upon
his
back
now
run
you
along
in
front
and
we
ll
follow
behind
said
old
etawa
as
he
put
one
paw
over
the
left
shoulder
and
the
other
under
the
right
arm
and
clasped
his
legs
tightly
around
the
loins
of
mátsailéma
so
as
to
hug
close
to
his
back
grandfather
you
are
as
heavy
as
a
rock
and
as
hard
as
one
too
said
the
younger
brother
how
can
i
dodge
those
stinging
beasts
that
s
all
the
better
for
you
said
the
old
turtle
loosening
his
grip
a
little
take
it
they
re
coming
they
re
coming
shouted
áhaiyúta
from
ahead
hurry
hurry
brother
younger
hurry
but
mátsailéma
couldn
t
get
along
any
faster
than
he
could
presently
the
old
turtle
glanced
around
and
saw
that
the
people
were
gaining
on
them
and
already
drawing
their
bows
duck
your
head
down
and
never
mind
them
now
you
ll
see
what
i
can
do
said
he
pulling
into
his
shell
rattled
the
arrows
against
old
etawa
s
shell
and
the
warriors
were
already
shouting
which
was
their
cry
of
victory
when
they
began
to
cry
out
in
other
tones
for
their
arrows
glanced
from
old
turtle
s
shell
and
struck
themselves
so
that
they
dropped
in
every
direction
terror
and
blood
but
those
beings
can
shoot
fast
and
hard
shouted
they
to
one
another
but
they
kept
pelting
away
harder
and
faster
only
to
hit
one
another
with
the
glancing
arrows
hold
cried
one
in
advance
of
the
others
head
them
off
head
them
off
we
re
only
shooting
ourselves
against
that
black
shield
of
theirs
and
the
other
loosens
our
but
just
then
áhaiyúta
reached
the
home
of
his
other
grandfather
amiwili
behold
he
was
all
swollen
up
with
food
and
could
hardly
move
only
wag
his
head
back
and
forth
are
you
coming
groaned
the
old
fellow
quick
get
out
of
the
way
all
of
you
quick
quick
áhaiyúta
jumped
out
of
the
way
just
as
mátsailéma
cried
out
hua
i
can
run
no
farther
i
must
drop
you
grandfather
but
he
saw
áhaiyúta
jump
to
one
side
so
he
followed
too
old
amiwili
reared
himself
and
opening
his
mouth
weeh
right
and
left
he
threw
the
lizard
leaves
he
had
been
eating
until
the
háwikuhkwe
were
blinded
and
suffocated
by
them
and
dropping
their
bows
and
weapons
began
to
clutch
their
eyes
from
blindness
and
pain
and
old
amiwili
coughed
and
coughed
till
he
had
blown
nearly
all
his
substance
away
and
there
was
nothing
left
of
him
but
a
worm
no
bigger
than
your
middle
finger
drop
me
and
make
your
winnings
cried
the
old
turtle
i
guess
i
can
take
care
of
myself
he
chuckled
from
the
inside
of
his
shell
and
it
was
short
work
for
the
boys
to
cast
down
all
their
enemies
whom
amiwili
had
blown
upon
and
the
others
fled
terrified
toward
háwikuh
ha
ha
laughed
the
two
boys
as
they
began
to
take
off
the
scalps
of
the
háwikuhkwe
these
caps
are
better
than
half
a
flock
of
who
ll
proclaim
our
victory
to
our
people
said
they
suddenly
stopping
and
one
would
have
thought
they
belonged
to
a
big
village
and
a
great
tribe
instead
of
to
a
lone
house
on
top
of
twin
mountain
with
a
single
old
granny
in
it
but
then
that
was
their
way
you
know
i
will
i
will
cried
the
old
turtle
as
he
waddled
off
toward
twin
mountain
and
left
the
boys
to
skin
scalps
when
he
came
to
the
top
of
the
low
hill
south
of
master
cañon
he
stuck
a
stick
up
in
the
air
and
shouted
which
is
the
shout
of
victory
and
not
seeing
the
old
woman
he
cried
out
two
or
three
times
which
as
you
know
means
murder
murder
the
old
woman
heard
it
and
was
frightened
she
threw
an
old
robe
over
her
shoulders
and
grabbing
up
the
started
down
as
fast
as
her
limping
old
limbs
would
let
her
and
nearly
tumbled
over
when
she
heard
old
etawa
shout
again
ha
said
she
i
ll
teach
the
shameless
turkey
killers
if
i
am
an
old
woman
and
she
shook
her
in
the
air
until
she
came
up
to
where
the
old
turtle
was
waiting
here
just
as
she
came
near
the
old
turtle
pretended
not
to
see
her
but
stood
up
on
his
legs
and
holding
his
pole
with
one
hand
cried
out
which
was
the
shout
of
victory
as
i
told
you
before
what
is
it
cried
the
old
woman
as
she
limped
along
up
and
said
ahi
my
poor
old
legs
victory
said
the
proud
turtle
scarcely
deigning
to
look
at
her
the
ridiculousness
of
the
dialogue
which
follows
may
readily
be
understood
when
it
is
explained
that
each
office
in
the
celebration
of
victory
has
to
be
performed
by
a
distinct
individual
of
specified
clans
according
to
the
function
who
has
this
day
renewed
himself
she
inquired
thy
grandchildren
answered
the
old
turtle
have
they
won
asked
the
old
woman
as
she
said
thanks
this
day
many
caps
replied
the
turtle
will
they
celebrate
who
will
purify
and
pass
them
asked
the
granny
why
you
who
will
bathe
the
scalps
why
i
who
will
swing
the
scalps
round
the
pueblo
why
you
who
will
adopt
them
why
you
who
will
bring
out
the
feast
why
you
who
will
be
the
priest
of
initiation
why
i
who
will
be
the
why
i
who
will
be
the
dancers
why
i
who
will
draw
the
arrows
and
sacrifice
them
why
i
who
will
strive
for
the
sacrificed
arrows

i
who
will
lead
the
dance
of
victory

i
who

you
who
will
be
the
priests
of
their
father
society
why
i
and
they
might
have
talked
that
way
till
sunset
had
not
the
voices
of
the
two
boys
singing
the
song
of
victory
been
heard
coming
over
the
hill
there
they
were
coming
with
two
great
strings
of
scalps
as
big
as
a
bunch
of
buckskins
oh
poor
me
how
shall
i
swing
all
those
scalps
round
the
pueblo
groaned
the
poor
old
woman
as
she
limped
off
to
dress
for
the
ceremony
why
swing
them
answered
the
old
turtle
as
he
stretched
himself
up
with
the
importance
of
being
master
of
ceremonies
so
the
boys
brought
the
scalps
up
and
the
old
turtle
strung
them
thickly
on
a
long
pole
so
day
after
day
they
danced
and
sang
to
add
strands
to
the
width
of
the
boys
badges
and
the
old
turtle
was
of
ceremonies
and
people
low
priest
and
dancers
sacrificer
of
arrows
and
striver
after
the
arrows
he
would
beat
the
drum
and
sing
a
little
then
run
and
dance
out
the
measure
but
it
was
very
hard
work
and
the
old
woman
was
mother
of
the
children
and
sisters
and
their
clan
and
somebody
s
else
clan
matron
of
ceremonials
and
maidens
of
ceremonials
all
at
the
same
time
but
it
was
very
hard
work
consequently
they
didn
t
get
along
very
well
that
s
the
reason
why
today
we
have
so
many
and
singers
dance
leaders
and
dancers
priests
and
common
people
father
clans
and
mother
clans
in
the
great
ceremony
of
victory
thus
it
happened
with
áhaiyúta
and
mátsailéma
and
their
old
grandmother
and
their
grandfathers
the
and
the
old
turtle
that
is
the
reason
why
are
no
bigger
than
your
finger
now
because
their
great
grandfather
blew
all
his
substance
away
at
the
háwikuhkwe
that
s
the
reason
why
the
great
turtles
in
the
waters
of
the
world
are
so
much
bigger
than
their
brothers
and
sisters
here
and
have
so
many
marks
on
their
shells
where
the
arrows
glanced
across
the
shield
of
their
great
grandfather
for
old
etawa
was
so
proud
after
he
had
been
the
great
master
of
ceremonies
that
he
despised
his
old
pond
and
went
off
to
seek
a
new
home
in
the
western
waters

the
young
who
was
stripped
of
his
clothing
by
the
aged
tarantula
a
long
long
time
ago
in
k
iákime
there
lived
a
young
man
the
son
of
the
of
the
town
it
was
this
young
man
s
custom
to
dress
himself
as
for
a
dance
and
run
entirely
around
thunder
mountain
each
morning
before
the
sun
rose
before
making
his
prayers
he
was
a
handsome
young
man
and
his
costume
was
beautiful
to
behold
now
below
the
two
broad
columns
of
rock
which
stand
at
the
southeastern
end
of
thunder
mountain
and
which
are
called
ak
below
these
in
the
base
of
the
mountain
an
old
old
tarantula
had
his
den
of
a
morning
as
the
young
man
in
his
beautiful
dress
sped
by
the
old
tarantula
heard
the
which
were
attached
to
his
belt
and
saw
him
as
he
passed
this
young
and
he
thought
to
himself
ah
ha
now
if
i
could
only
get
his
fine
apparel
away
from
him
what
luck
it
would
be
for
me
i
will
wait
for
him
the
next
early
the
next
morning
just
as
the
sun
peeped
over
the
lid
of
the
world
sure
enough
the
old
tarantula
heard
the
and
thrusting
his
head
out
of
his
den
waited
as
the
young
man
approached
he
called
out
to
him
hold
my
young
friend
come
here
what
for
replied
the
youth
i
am
in
a
great
never
mind
that
come
here
said
the
old
tarantula
what
is
it
why
do
you
detain
me
rejoined
the
youth
it
is
for
this
reason
said
the
old
tarantula
wouldn
t
you
like
to
look
at
yourself
today
for
if
you
would
i
can
show
you
how
asked
the
young
man
make
haste
for
i
am
in
a
well
in
this
way
was
the
reply
take
off
your
clothing
all
of
it
then
i
will
take
off
mine
you
place
yours
in
a
heap
before
me
i
will
place
mine
in
a
heap
before
you
then
i
will
put
on
your
apparel
as
you
wear
it
and
then
you
will
see
what
a
handsome
fellow
you
the
young
man
thought
about
it
and
concluded
that
it
would
be
a
very
good
thing
to
do
so
he
began
drawing
off
his
clothing
his
beautiful
painted
moccasins
red
and
green
his
fine
white
leggings
knitted
with
cunning
stitches
and
fringed
down
the
front
like
the
leggings
worn
by
the
master
of
the
dances
at
new
year
his
skirt
and
mantle
and
coat
all
of
white
cotton
and
marked
with
figures
in
many
colors
his
heavy
anklets
of
sacred
white
shell
his
blue
turquoise
earrings
like
the
sky
in
blueness
and
so
long
that
they
swept
his
shoulders
his
plaited
headband
of
fibers
and
his
bunch
of
blue
red
and
yellow
macaw
feathers
which
he
wore
in
his
at
the
back
of
his
head
all
these
things
one
after
another
he
took
off
and
laid
before
the
ugly
old
tarantula
then
that
woolly
hairy
clammy
creature
hauled
off
his
clothing
ugly
and
coarse
leggings
skirt
and
coat
and
mantle
nothing
but
woolly
and
hairy
ugly
and
dirty
when
the
old
tarantula
had
done
this
he
began
to
put
on
the
handsome
garments
that
the
young
man
had
placed
before
him
and
after
he
had
dressed
himself
in
these
he
perched
himself
up
on
his
crooked
hindlegs
and
said
look
at
me
now
how
do
i
look
well
so
far
as
the
clothing
is
concerned
handsome
said
the
young
man
just
wait
till
i
get
a
little
farther
off
said
the
old
tarantula
and
he
straightened
himself
up
and
walked
backward
toward
the
door
of
his
den
presently
he
stopped
and
stood
still
and
said
how
do
i
look
now
handsomer
said
the
young
man
just
wait
till
i
get
a
little
farther
and
again
he
walked
backward
which
is
a
way
tarantulas
have
and
stood
up
straight
and
said
how
do
i
look
now
handsomer
still
said
the
young
man
ah
ha
just
wait
till
i
get
a
little
farther
and
now
he
backed
to
the
very
door
of
his
den
and
stood
upon
the
lip
of
the
entrance
and
said
now
then
how
do
i
look
perfectly
handsome
said
the
young
man
ah
ha
chuckled
the
old
tarantula
and
he
turned
himself
around
and
plunged
headforemost
into
his
hole
out
upon
him
cried
the
young
man
as
he
stood
there
with
his
head
bowed
and
thinking
out
upon
the
old
rascal
that
is
the
trick
he
serves
me
is
it
fearful
said
he
what
shall
i
do
now
i
can
t
go
home
naked
or
half
naked
well
but
i
suppose
i
will
have
to
said
he
to
himself
and
bending
down
he
reached
for
the
hairy
that
had
been
left
there
by
the
old
tarantula
and
the
skirt
and
put
them
on
and
took
his
way
swiftly
homeward
when
he
reached
home
the
sun
was
high
which
never
had
happened
before
so
that
the
old
people
had
been
thinking
surely
something
must
have
happened
to
our
young
man
that
he
comes
not
as
early
as
and
when
he
came
they
said
what
has
happened
that
has
detained
you
so
ha
replied
the
youth
the
old
tarantula
that
lives
under
the
ak
has
stripped
me
of
my
garments
and
with
them
has
run
away
into
his
we
thought
something
of
the
kind
must
have
happened
said
his
old
father
send
for
your
warrior
priest
said
the
other
old
ones
let
us
see
what
he
thinks
about
this
and
what
shall
be
so
the
sent
for
his
warrior
priest
and
when
the
latter
had
come
he
asked
why
is
it
that
you
have
sent
for
me
true
we
have
sent
for
you
said
the
father
because
old
tarantula
has
stripped
my
son
of
his
handsome
apparel
which
is
sacred
and
precious
and
we
therefore
hold
it
a
great
loss
to
him
and
us
how
do
you
think
we
can
recover
what
has
been
stolen
the
warrior
priest
thought
a
moment
and
said
i
should
think
we
would
have
to
dig
him
out
for
it
isn
t
likely
he
will
show
himself
far
from
his
den
so
the
warrior
priest
went
out
on
the
tops
of
the
houses
and
called
to
his
people
i
instruct
ye
this
day
oh
my
people
and
children
listen
to
my
instruction
our
child
in
running
to
and
from
his
prayers
this
very
morning
was
intercepted
by
old
tarantula
who
through
his
skill
and
cunning
succeeded
in
stripping
our
child
of
his
handsome
apparel
therefore
i
instruct
ye
make
haste
gather
together
and
hoes
let
us
all
go
and
dig
out
the
old
villain
let
the
whole
town
turn
out
women
as
well
as
men
and
children
my
daughters
ye
women
of
this
town
take
with
ye
and
baskets
and
other
things
wherewith
ye
gather
material
for
plaster
with
which
to
convey
away
the
sand
and
earth
that
is
dug
up
by
the
men
thus
much
i
instruct
ye
make
haste
all
whereupon
he
descended
and
after
eating
led
the
way
toward
the
den
of
old
tarantula
when
the
people
had
also
eaten
and
followed
they
began
to
work
swiftly
at
tunnelling
into
the
hole
of
the
tarantula
and
thus
they
worked
and
worked
from
morning
till
night
but
did
not
overtake
him
until
at
last
they
reached
the
solid
rock
foundations
of
the
mountain
they
had
filled
their
baskets
and
with
the
sand
and
cast
it
behind
them
and
others
had
cast
it
behind
them
and
so
on
until
a
large
hillock
of
earth
and
sand
had
been
raised
but
still
they
had
not
overtaken
old
tarantula
now
when
they
had
reached
the
solid
rock
foundations
of
the
mountain
they
saw
that
the
hole
yawned
like
a
cave
before
them
and
that
it
was
needless
to
follow
farther
they
gave
up
in
despair
saying
what
more
can
we
do
let
us
go
home
let
us
give
it
up
since
we
and
they
took
their
ways
homeward
now
in
the
evening
the
old
ones
of
the
town
were
very
thoughtful
and
they
gathered
together
and
talked
the
matter
over
and
finally
it
was
suggested
by
someone
in
answer
to
the
query
what
can
we
do
to
recover
our
son
s
lost
garments
suppose
that
we
send
for
the
great
kingfisher
he
is
wise
crafty
swift
of
flight
he
dashes
himself
from
on
high
even
into
the
water
and
takes
him
therefrom
whatsoever
he
will
swift
though
it
be
without
fail
suppose
we
send
for
him
our
grandfather
ah
ha
that
s
it
replied
others
send
for
him
so
the
master
warrior
priest
called
to
young
and
sent
him
to
the
hill
of
the
great
kingfisher
what
is
it
asked
kingfisher
when
he
heard
someone
at
the
entrance
of
his
house
come
quickly
in
council
the
old
ones
of
our
town
await
you
said
the
young
man
so
great
kingfisher
followed
and
arriving
at
the
council
greeted
them
and
asked
what
is
it
you
would
have
of
me
said
they
old
tarantula
has
stripped
our
young
man
of
his
beautiful
garments
and
how
to
recover
them
we
know
not
we
have
dug
away
the
den
even
to
the
foundation
of
the
mountain
but
beyond
this
it
extends
what
to
do
we
know
not
so
we
have
sent
for
you
knowing
your
power
and
ability
to
quickly
snatch
even
from
under
the
waters
whatsoever
you
ah
ha
i
will
take
a
step
toward
this
thing
said
great
kingfisher
but
it
is
a
difficult
task
you
place
before
me
old
tarantula
is
exceedingly
cunning
and
very
keen
of
sight
moreover
i
will
however
take
a
step
and
if
i
have
good
luck
will
be
able
to
bring
back
to
you
something
of
what
he
has
he
then
made
his
adieu
and
went
back
to
his
house
at
the
hill
of
the
kingfisher
very
early
the
next
morning
he
took
his
swift
way
to
the
ak
and
there
where
the
columns
of
rock
fork
he
lay
himself
down
between
them
like
a
little
finger
between
two
other
fingers
merely
thrusting
his
beak
over
the
edge
and
looking
at
the
opening
of
old
tarantula
s
hole
the
plumes
of
sunlight
were
but
barely
gleaming
on
the
farther
edge
of
the
world
when
old
tarantula
cast
his
eyes
just
out
of
the
edge
of
his
hole
and
looked
all
around
eyes
like
many
eyes
had
he
wonderfully
sharp
and
clear
with
these
he
looked
all
around
as
might
have
been
expected
he
discovered
great
kingfisher
of
him
showing
and
called
out
wóloi
weee
ho
ho
skulker
skulking
ho
ho
skulker
skulking
instantly
great
kingfisher
shook
out
his
wings
and
descended
like
a
breath
of
strong
wind
and
finished
his
flight
like
a
loosed
arrow
but
he
merely
brushed
the
tips
of
the
plumes
in
old
tarantula
s
and
the
creature
doubled
himself
up
and
headforemost
plunged
into
his
hole
once
in
ha
ha
said
he
good
for
him
good
good
let
s
have
a
dance
and
sing
said
he
talking
to
himself
and
thereupon
he
pranced
up
jigged
about
his
dark
deep
room
singing
this
song
ya
ti
tákwà
ai
yaa
tákwà
ohatchik
ya
lii
tákwà
ohatchik
ya
lii
tákwà
ai
yaa
tákwà
ai
yaa
tákwà
tákwà
tákwà
thus
singing
he
danced
surely
a
song
that
nobody
but
he
could
dance
to
if
it
be
a
song
but
he
danced
to
it
and
when
he
had
finished
jigging
about
he
looked
at
his
fluttering
garments
and
said
ha
ha
just
look
at
my
fine
dress
now
am
i
not
handsome
i
tell
you
i
am
handsome
now
let
s
have
another
dance
and
again
he
sang
at
the
top
of
his
wheezing
voice
and
pranced
round
on
his
crooked
hind
legs
with
his
fine
garments
fluttering
but
great
kingfisher
with
wings
drooping
and
beak
gaped
down
at
the
corners
as
though
being
hungry
he
had
tried
to
catch
a
fish
and
hadn
t
caught
him
took
his
way
back
to
the
council
and
he
said
to
the
people
there
no
use
i
failed
utterly
as
i
said
before
he
is
a
crafty
old
fellow
what
more
have
i
to
say
he
made
his
adieus
and
took
his
way
back
to
the
hill
of
the
kingfisher
again
the
people
talked
with
one
another
and
considered
and
at
last
said
some
inasmuch
as
he
has
failed
let
us
send
for
our
grandfather
great
eagle
he
of
all
living
creatures
with
wings
is
swiftest
and
keenest
of
sight
strong
of
grasp
hooked
of
beak
whatever
getting
holding
and
getting
whatever
he
they
sent
for
the
eagle
he
came
and
when
made
acquainted
with
their
wishes
turned
quickly
and
said
in
bidding
them
adieu
i
think
that
possibly
i
can
succeed
though
surely
as
my
brother
has
said
old
tarantula
is
a
crafty
creature
i
will
do
my
early
the
next
morning
he
took
his
way
before
sunrise
to
the
peak
of
the
mountain
of
the
badgers
a
long
distance
away
from
ak
but
still
as
no
distance
to
the
eagle
there
he
stood
with
his
head
raised
to
the
winds
turning
first
one
eye
then
the
other
on
the
entrance
of
old
tarantula
s
den
until
old
tarantula
again
thrust
out
his
woolly
nose
as
might
have
been
expected
he
discovered
the
eagle
and
was
just
shouting
ho
skulker
skulking
when
the
eagle
swept
like
a
singing
stone
loosed
from
the
sling
straight
at
the
head
of
old
tarantula
but
his
wings
hissed
and
buzzed
past
the
hole
harmlessly
and
his
crooked
talons
reached
down
into
the
dark
clutching
nothing
save
one
of
the
plumes
in
old
tarantula
s
even
this
he
failed
to
bring
away
the
old
tarantula
tumbled
headlong
into
his
lower
room
and
exclaimed
ha
ha
goodness
save
us
what
a
startling
he
gave
me
but
he
didn
t
get
me
no
he
didn
t
get
me
let
s
have
a
dance
jig
it
down
what
a
fine
fellow
i
am
and
he
began
to
prance
about
and
jig
and
sing
as
he
had
sung
before
ya
ti
tákwà
ai
yaa
tákwà
ohatchik
ya
lii
tákwà
ohatchik
ya
lii
tákwà
ai
yaa
tákwà
ai
yaa
tákwà
tákwà
tákwà
as
soon
as
he
paused
for
breath
he
glanced
askance
at
his
fluttering
bright
garments
and
cried
out
ho
what
a
handsome
fellow
i
am
how
finely
dressed
i
am
let
s
have
another
dance
and
again
he
danced
and
sang
all
by
himself
admiring
himself
answering
his
own
questions
and
watching
his
own
movements
but
great
eagle
crestfallen
and
took
his
way
to
the
place
of
the
council
reported
his
failure
and
made
his
adieu
then
again
the
people
considered
and
the
old
ones
decided
to
send
for
hatchutsanona
the
lesser
falcon
whose
plumage
is
hard
and
smooth
and
speckled
gray
and
brown
like
the
rocks
and
sagebrush
and
who
being
swift
as
the
kingfisher
and
strong
as
the
eagle
and
small
is
not
only
able
to
fly
where
other
birds
fly
but
can
penetrate
the
closest
thicket
when
seeking
his
prey
for
trimmed
he
is
like
a
arrow
they
sent
for
him
he
came
and
being
made
acquainted
with
the
facts
of
the
case
said
he
could
but
try
though
he
modestly
affirmed
that
when
his
elder
brothers
great
kingfisher
and
great
eagle
had
made
such
efforts
it
were
needless
for
him
to
try
and
repeated
what
they
had
said
of
the
cunning
and
keenness
of
sight
of
old
tarantula
but
he
went
early
the
next
morning
and
placed
himself
on
the
very
edge
of
the
high
cliff
overhanging
the
columns
of
rock
and
looking
into
the
den
of
old
tarantula
there
when
the
sun
rose
you
could
scarcely
have
seen
him
even
though
near
you
might
have
been
for
his
coat
of
gray
and
brown
was
like
the
rocks
and
dry
grass
around
him
and
he
lay
very
close
to
the
ground
like
an
autumn
leaf
beaten
down
by
the
rain
old
tarantula
thrust
out
his
rugged
face
and
turned
his
eyes
in
every
direction
up
and
down
then
twisted
his
head
from
side
to
side
he
saw
nothing
he
had
even
poked
his
head
entirely
out
of
his
hole
and
his
shoulders
were
just
visible
when
lesser
falcon
bestirred
himself
and
old
tarantula
alas
saw
him
not
in
time
to
wholly
save
himself
however
for
lesser
falcon
with
a
sweep
of
his
wings
like
the
swirl
of
a
snowdrift
shot
into
the
mouth
of
old
tarantula
s
den
grasped
at
his
head
and
brought
away
with
him
the
macaw
plumes
of
the
youth
s
down
into
his
den
tumbled
old
tarantula
and
he
sat
down
and
bent
himself
double
with
fright
and
chagrin
he
wagged
his
head
to
and
fro
and
sighed
alas
alas
my
beautiful
the
skulking
wretch
my
beautiful
he
has
taken
it
from
me
what
is
the
use
of
bothering
about
a
miserable
bunch
of
macaw
feathers
anyway
they
get
dirty
they
get
bent
and
broken
moths
eat
them
they
change
their
color
what
is
the
use
of
troubling
myself
about
a
worthless
thing
like
that
haven
t
i
still
the
finest
costume
in
the
valley
handsome
leggings
and
embroidered
skirt
and
mantle
sleeves
as
pretty
as
flowers
in
summer
necklaces
worth
fifty
and
earrings
worth
a
handful
of
such
necklaces
ha
ha
let
him
away
with
the
old
let
s
have
a
dance
and
dance
her
down
old
fellow
said
he
talking
to
himself
and
again
he
skipped
about
and
sang
his
tuneless
song

he
admired
himself
as
much
as
before
forsooth
said
he
i
could
not
have
seen
the
for
i
would
have
worn
it
in
the
back
of
my
the
lesser
falcon
cursing
at
his
took
his
way
back
to
the
council
and
casting
the
at
the
feet
of
the
old
men
said
alas
my
fathers
this
is
the
best
i
could
do
for
before
i
had
fairly
taken
my
flight
old
tarantula
discovered
me
and
made
into
his
den
but
this
i
got
and
i
bring
it
to
you
may
others
succeed
better
thou
hast
succeeded
exceeding
well
for
most
precious
are
these
plumes
from
summerland
said
the
old
priest
thanks
be
to
you
this
day
my
grandfather
and
the
lesser
falcon
took
his
way
to
the
thickets
and
hillsides
then
the
people
said
to
one
another
what
more
is
there
to
be
done
we
must
even
have
recourse
to
the
gods
it
and
they
called
and
said
to
him
of
the
feathered
creatures
we
have
chosen
the
wisest
and
swiftest
and
strongest
to
aid
us
yet
they
have
failed
mainly
therefore
we
would
even
send
you
to
the
gods
for
your
performance
of
duty
to
them
has
been
faithful
from
morning
to
so
they
instructed
him
to
climb
to
the
top
of
thunder
mountain
and
visit
the
home
of
the
two
áhaiyúta
and
mátsailéma
for
in
those
days
they
still
dwelt
on
the
top
of
thunder
mountain
with
their
old
grandmother
at
the
middle
place
of
sacrifice
the
priests
in
the
town
prepared
sacrificial
plumes
and
divided
their
treasures
for
the
gods
and
again
calling
the
young
man
presented
them
to
him
as
their
messenger
bidding
him
bear
to
the
gods
their
greetings
on
the
morning
following
he
climbed
the
steep
path
and
soon
neared
the
dwelling
of
the
gods
and
their
grandmother
she
was
on
the
roof
of
the
house
while
the
two
bad
boys
always
out
of
the
way
when
wanted
and
never
ceasing
to
play
their
pranks
as
was
their
little
way
you
know
were
down
in
the
lower
rooms
the
old
grandmother
bade
the
youth
to
enter
and
called
out
to
her
grandchildren
the
two
gods
my
children
come
up
both
of
you
quickly
a
young
man
has
arrived
to
see
you
bringing
so
they
cast
off
their
playful
behavior
and
with
great
gravity
came
into
the
room
and
looking
up
to
the
tall
youth
said
thou
hast
come
may
it
be
happily
sit
down
what
is
it
that
thou
wouldst
have
because
for
nothing
no
stranger
comes
to
the
house
of
it
is
true
this
which
you
say
said
the
youth
reverently
breathing
on
his
hands
o
ye
my
fathers
i
bring
greetings
from
the
fathers
of
my
town
below
the
mountain
and
offerings
from
it
is
well
thus
my
child
replied
the
gods
and
i
bring
also
my
burden
of
trouble
that
i
may
listen
to
your
counsel
and
perchance
implore
your
aid
said
the
youth
what
is
it
said
the
two
and
they
listened
then
the
youth
related
his
misfortune
telling
how
he
had
been
stripped
of
his
clothing
by
old
tarantula
how
the
old
ones
gathered
in
council
had
sought
the
aid
one
after
another
of
the
wisest
and
swiftest
of
feathered
beings
but
with
little
success
how
they
had
at
last
counselled
his
coming
to
them
the
fathers
of
the
people
in
times
of
difficulty
and
strife
grandmother
shouted
the
younger
brother
make
haste
make
haste
grandmother
bestir
yourself
grind
flour
for
us
let
it
be
rock
flour
the
old
grandmother
gathered
some
white
calcareous
sandstone
called
she
broke
those
rocks
into
fragments
and
ground
them
into
meal
then
reduced
them
on
a
finer
stone
to
soft
impalpable
powder
she
made
dough
of
this
with
water
and
the
two
gods
with
wonderful
skill
molded
this
dough
as
it
hardened
into
figures
of
two
deer
and
two
antelope
images
they
made
when
they
had
finished
these
they
placed
them
before
the
youth
and
said
take
these
and
stand
them
on
the
sacrificial
or
terrace
on
the
southern
side
of
our
mountain
with
prayer
to
the
gods
over
them
return
to
your
home
and
tell
the
old
ones
what
we
have
directed
you
to
do
tell
them
also
where
we
said
you
should
place
these
beings
for
such
they
will
become
upon
the
and
you
should
go
to
greet
them
in
the
morning
and
guide
them
with
you
toward
the
den
of
old
tarantula
old
tarantula
is
very
fond
of
hunting
nothing
is
so
pleasing
to
him
as
to
kill
anything
that
thereby
he
may
be
tempted
forth
from
his
in
his
the
youth
did
as
he
was
directed
and
when
he
had
placed
the
figures
of
the
deer
and
the
antelope
in
a
row
on
the
shelf
and
reached
home
he
informed
the
old
ones
of
the
word
that
had
been
sent
to
them
his
father
the
old
called
the
warrior
priest
and
said
to
him
it
may
be
possible
that
old
tarantula
will
be
tempted
forth
from
his
den
tomorrow
would
it
not
be
well
for
us
to
take
the
against
him
it
would
indeed
be
well
said
the
warrior
priest
and
the
went
to
the
and
called
to
the
people
saying
o
ye
my
people
and
children
i
instruct
ye
today
let
the
young
men
and
the
warriors
gather
and
prepare
as
for
war
by
means
of
the
sacred
images
which
have
been
made
by
the
two
beloved
for
our
son
it
may
be
that
we
shall
succeed
in
tempting
old
tarantula
forth
from
his
den
tomorrow
let
us
be
prepared
to
capture
him
make
haste
make
ready
thus
much
i
instruct
in
great
haste
as
if
under
the
influence
of
joyful
tidings
indeed
the
people
prepared
for
war
gathered
together
in
great
numbers
testing
the
strength
of
their
bows
and
with
much
racket
issued
forth
from
the
town
under
thunder
mountain
spreading
over
all
the
and
toward
daylight
the
youth
alone
took
his
way
toward
the
sacrificial
on
the
side
of
the
mountain
when
he
arrived
there
behold
the
two
antelopes
and
the
two
deer
were
tamely
walking
about
cropping
the
grass
and
tender
leaves
and
as
he
approached
they
said
so
here
you
now
this
day
behold
my
children
said
he
in
his
prayer
even
for
the
reason
that
we
have
made
ye
beings
follow
my
instructions
oh
do
most
wickedly
and
shamefully
has
old
tarantula
living
below
ak
robbed
me
of
my
sacred
fine
apparel
i
therefore
call
ye
to
aid
me
go
ye
now
toward
his
home
that
he
may
be
tempted
forth
by
the
sight
of
obediently
the
deer
and
antelope
took
their
way
down
the
sloping
sides
of
the
toward
old
tarantula
s
den
as
they
neared
the
den
the
youth
called
out
from
one
of
the
valleys
below
hasten
there
go
some
deer
and
antelope
whoever
may
be
near
them
understand
there
go
some
deer
and
antelope
old
tarantula
was
talking
to
himself
as
usual
down
in
his
inner
room
he
heard
the
faint
sound
ha
cried
he
what
is
this
humming
somebody
calling
no
he
skipped
out
toward
the
doorway
just
as
the
young
man
called
the
second
time
ah
ha
said
he
he
says
deer
are
coming
doesn
t
he
let
us
and
presently
when
the
young
man
called
the
third
time
he
exclaimed
that
s
it
that
is
what
he
is
calling
out
now
for
a
hunt
i
might
as
well
get
them
as
anyone
he
caught
up
his
bow
slipped
the
noose
over
the
head
of
it
twanged
the
string
and
started
but
just
as
he
was
going
out
of
his
hole
he
said
to
himself
good
daylight
this
never
will
do
they
will
be
after
me
if
i
go
out
oh
pshaw
nonsense
they
will
do
nothing
of
the
kind
what
does
it
matter
haven
t
i
bow
and
arrows
with
me
he
leaped
out
of
his
hole
and
started
off
toward
the
deer
as
he
gained
an
eminence
he
cried
ah
ha
sure
enough
there
they
come
indeed
he
was
telling
the
truth
the
deer
still
approached
and
when
the
first
one
came
near
he
drew
an
arrow
strongly
and
let
fly
one
of
them
dropped
at
once
ah
ha
cried
he
who
says
i
am
not
a
good
hunter
he
whipped
out
another
arrow
and
fired
at
the
second
deer
which
dropped
where
it
had
stood
with
more
exclamations
of
delight
he
shot
at
the
antelope
following
which
fell
and
then
at
the
last
one
which
fell
as
the
others
had
now
said
he
i
suppose
i
might
as
well
take
my
meat
home
fine
game
i
have
bagged
he
untied
the
strap
which
he
had
brought
along
and
tied
together
the
legs
of
the
first
deer
he
had
shot
he
stooped
down
raised
the
deer
knelt
on
the
ground
and
drew
the
strap
over
his
forehead
and
was
just
about
to
rise
with
his
burden
and
make
off
for
his
den
when
he
fell
down
almost
crushed
under
a
mass
of
white
rock
goodness
what
s
this
mercy
but
this
is
startling
he
looked
around
but
he
saw
nothing
of
his
game
save
a
shapeless
mass
of
white
rock
well
i
will
try
this
other
one
said
he
to
himself
he
had
no
sooner
placed
the
other
on
his
back
than
down
it
bore
him
another
mass
of
white
rock
what
can
be
the
matter
the
devil
must
be
to
pay
said
he
then
he
tried
the
next
with
no
better
success
well
there
is
one
left
anyway
said
he
he
tied
the
feet
of
the
last
one
together
and
was
about
to
place
the
strap
over
his
forehead
when
he
heard
a
mighty
and
thundering
tread
and
great
shouting
and
a
terrible
noise
altogether
for
the
people
were
already
gathering
about
his
den
he
made
for
the
mouth
of
it
with
all
possible
speed
but
the
people
were
there
before
him
they
closed
in
upon
him
they
clutched
at
his
stolen
garments
they
pulled
his
earrings
out
of
his
ears
slitting
his
ears
in
doing
so
until
he
put
up
his
hands
and
cried
death
and
ashes
mercy
mercy
you
hurt
you
hurt
don
t
treat
me
so
i
ll
be
good
hereafter
i
ll
take
the
clothing
off
and
give
it
back
to
you
without
making
the
slightest
trouble
if
you
will
let
me
but
the
people
closed
in
still
more
angrily
and
pulled
him
about
buffeted
him
tore
his
clothing
from
him
until
he
was
left
nude
and
bruised
and
so
maimed
that
he
could
hardly
move
then
the
old
priests
gathered
around
and
said
one
of
them
it
will
not
be
well
if
we
let
this
beast
go
as
he
is
he
is
too
large
too
powerful
and
too
crafty
he
has
but
to
think
of
destruction
forsooth
he
destroys
he
has
but
to
think
of
it
is
accomplished
it
will
not
be
well
that
he
should
go
abroad
thus
he
must
be
roasted
and
thus
only
can
we
rid
the
world
of
him
as
he
so
the
people
assembled
and
heaped
up
great
quantities
of
dry
firewood
and
they
drilled
fire
from
a
stick
and
lighted
the
mass
then
they
cast
the
struggling
tarantula
amid
the
flames
and
he
squeaked
and
sizzled
and
hissed
and
swelled
and
swelled
and
swelled
until
with
a
terrific
noise
he
burst
and
the
fragments
of
his
carcass
were
cast
to
the
uttermost
parts
of
the
earth
these
parts
again
took
shape
as
beings
not
unlike
old
tarantula
himself
thus
it
was
in
the
days
of
the
ancients
and
therefore
today
though
crooked
are
the
legs
of
the
tarantula
and
his
habit
of
progress
backward
still
he
is
distributed
throughout
the
great
world
only
he
is
very
very
much
smaller
than
was
the
great
tarantula
who
lived
below
the
two
rocky
columns
of
thunder
mountain
thus
shortens
my
story
átahsaia
the
cannibal
demon
in
the
days
of
the
ancients
when
the
children
of
our
forefathers
lived
in
héshokta
town
of
the
cliffs
there
also
lived
two
beautiful
maidens
elder
and
younger
sisters
one
to
the
other
daughters
of
a
one
bright
morning
in
the
elder
sister
called
to
the
younger
what
sayest
thou
said
the
the
day
is
bright
and
the
water
is
warm
let
us
go
down
to
the
pool
and
wash
our
clothes
that
we
may
wear
them
as
if
new
at
the
dance
to
ah
yes
sister
elder
said
the
but
these
are
days
when
they
say
the
shadows
of
the
rocks
and
even
the
lodge
unthinkable
things
and
cause
those
who
walk
alone
to
breathe
hard
with
exclaimed
the
elder
sister
derisively
younger
sisters
always
are
as
timid
as
younger
brothers
are
ah
well
then
as
you
will
sister
elder
i
will
not
quarrel
with
your
wish
but
i
fear
to
come
along
then
said
the
elder
sister
whereupon
they
gathered
their
cotton
mantles
and
other
garments
into
bundles
and
taking
along
a
bag
of
or
started
together
down
the
steep
crooked
path
to
where
the
pool
lay
at
the
foot
of
the
great
mesa
now
far
above
the
town
of
the
cliffs
among
the
rocks
of
and
yellow
red
in
the
form
of
a
mountain
that
looks
like
a
frozen
there
is
a
deep
cave
you
have
never
seen
it
well
to
this
day
it
is
called
the
cave
of
átahsaia
and
there
in
the
times
i
tell
of
lived
átahsaia
himself
uhh
what
an
ugly
demon
he
was
his
body
was
as
big
as
the
biggest
elk
s
and
his
breast
was
shaggy
with
hair
as
stiff
as
his
legs
and
arms
were
long
and
brawny
all
covered
with
speckled
scales
of
black
and
white
his
hair
was
coarse
and
snarly
as
a
buffalo
s
mane
and
his
eyes
were
so
big
and
glaring
that
they
popped
out
of
his
head
like
skinned
onions
his
mouth
stretched
from
one
cheek
to
the
other
and
was
filled
with
crooked
fangs
as
yellow
as
his
lips
were
as
red
and
puffy
as
peppers
and
his
face
as
wrinkled
and
rough
as
a
piece
of
burnt
buckskin
that
was
átahsaia
who
in
the
days
of
the
ancients
devoured
men
and
women
for
his
meat
and
the
children
of
men
for
his
his
weapons
were
terrible
too
his
were
as
long
as
the
claws
of
a
bear
and
in
his
left
hand
he
carried
a
bow
made
of
the
sapling
of
a
with
two
arrows
ready
drawn
for
use
and
he
was
never
seen
without
his
great
flint
knife
as
broad
as
a
man
s
thigh
and
twice
as
long
which
he
brandished
with
his
right
hand
and
poked
his
hair
back
with
so
that
his
grizzly
were
covered
with
the
blood
of
those
he
had
slaughtered
he
wore
over
his
shoulders
whole
skins
of
the
mountain
lion
and
bear
clasped
with
buttons
of
wood
now
although
átahsaia
was
ugly
and
could
not
speak
without
chattering
his
teeth
or
laugh
without
barking
like
a
wolf
he
was
a
very
polite
demon
but
like
many
ugly
and
polite
people
nowadays
he
was
a
great
liar
átahsaia
that
morning
woke
up
and
stuck
his
head
out
of
his
hole
just
as
the
two
maidens
went
down
to
the
spring
he
caught
sight
of
them
while
his
eyes
travelled
below
and
he
chuckled
then
he
muttered
as
he
gazed
at
them
and
saw
how
young
and
fine
they
were
good
lunch
two
for
a
munch
and
howled
his
till
teshaminkia
the
shouted
it
to
the
maidens
oh
exclaimed
the
clutching
the
arm
of
her
elder
sister
listen
again
roared
the
demon
and
again
teshaminkia
oh
oh
sister
elder
what
did
i
tell
you
why
did
we
come
out
today
and
both
ran
away
then
stopped
to
listen
when
they
heard
nothing
more
they
returned
to
the
spring
and
went
to
washing
their
clothes
on
some
flat
stones
but
átahsaia
grabbed
up
his
weapons
and
began
to
clamber
down
the
mountain
muttering
and
chuckling
to
himself
as
he
went
good
lunch
two
for
a
munch
around
the
corner
of
great
mesa
on
the
high
shelves
of
which
stands
the
town
of
the
cliffs
are
two
towering
buttes
called
twin
mountain
far
up
on
the
top
of
this
mountain
there
dwelt
áhaiyúta
and
mátsailéma
you
don
t
know
who
áhaiyúta
and
mátsailéma
were
well
i
will
tell
you
they
were
the
twin
children
of
the
and
the
mother
waters
of
the
world
before
men
were
born
to
the
light
the
sun
made
love
to
the
waters
of
the
world
and
under
his
warm
bright
glances
there
were
hatched
out
of
a
on
the
face
of
the
great
ocean
which
then
covered
the
earth
two
wonderful
boys
whom
men
afterward
named
nam
atch
píahk
the
beloved
two
who
fell
the
sun
dried
away
the
waters
from
the
of
earth
and
these
two
then
delivered
men
forth
from
the
bowels
of
our
and
guided
them
eastward
toward
the
home
of
their
father
the
sun
the
time
came
alas
when
war
and
many
strange
beings
arose
to
destroy
the
children
of
earth
and
then
the
eight
stern
beings
changed
the
hearts
of
the
twins
to
or
the
medicine
of
war
thenceforth
they
were
known
as
áhaiyúta
and
mátsailéma
our
beloved
the
terrible
two
of
war
even
though
changed
they
still
guarded
our
ancients
and
guided
them
to
the
middle
of
the
world
where
we
now
live
gifted
with
hearts
of
the
medicine
of
war
and
with
wisdom
almost
as
great
as
the
s
own
they
became
the
invincible
guardians
of
the
of
earth
and
with
the
rainbow
for
their
weapon
and
thunderbolts
for
their
arrows
swift
pointed
with
turquoise
were
the
greatest
warriors
of
all
in
the
days
of
the
new
when
at
last
they
had
conquered
most
of
the
enemies
of
men
they
taught
to
a
chosen
few
of
their
followers
the
songs
prayers
and
orders
of
a
society
of
warriors
who
should
be
called
their
children
the
priests
of
the
bow
and
selecting
from
among
them
the
two
wisest
breathed
into
their
nostrils
as
they
have
since
breathed
into
those
of
their
successors
the
since
then
we
make
anew
the
semblance
of
their
being
and
place
them
each
year
at
on
the
top
of
the
mountain
of
thunder
and
on
the
top
of
the
mountain
of
the
beloved
that
they
may
know
we
remember
them
and
that
they
may
guard
as
it
was
said
in
the
days
of
the
ancients
they
would
guard
the
land
of
zuñi
from
sunrise
to
sunset
and
cut
off
the
pathways
of
the
enemy
here
and
hereafter
i
use
this
term
reluctantly
in
lack
of
a
better
word
but
in
accordance
with
webster
s
second
f
well
áhaiyúta
who
is
called
the
elder
brother
and
mátsailéma
who
is
called
the
younger
were
living
on
the
top
of
twin
mountain
with
their
old
grandmother
said
the
elder
to
the
younger
on
this
same
morning
brother
let
us
go
out
and
hunt
it
is
a
fine
day
what
say
you
my
face
is
in
front
of
me
said
the
younger
and
under
a
roof
is
no
place
for
men
he
added
as
he
put
on
his
helmet
of
and
took
a
quiver
of
skin
from
an
antler
near
the
ladder
where
are
you
two
boys
going
now
shrieked
the
grandmother
through
a
from
below
don
t
you
ever
intend
to
stop
worrying
me
by
going
abroad
when
even
the
spaces
breed
fear
like
thick
war
o
grandmother
they
laughed
as
they
tightened
their
bows
and
straightened
their
arrows
before
the
fire
never
mind
us
we
are
only
going
out
for
a
hunt
and
before
the
old
woman
could
climb
up
to
stop
them
they
were
gaily
skipping
down
the
rocks
toward
the
cliffs
below
suddenly
the
younger
brother
stopped
ahh
said
he
listen
brother
it
is
the
cry
of
átahsaia
and
the
old
wretch
is
surely
abroad
to
cause
tears
yes
replied
the
elder
it
is
átahsaia
and
we
must
stop
him
come
on
come
on
quick
hold
brother
hold
stiffen
your
feet
right
here
with
patience
he
is
after
the
two
maidens
of
héshokta
i
saw
them
going
to
the
spring
as
i
came
down
this
day
he
must
die
is
your
face
to
the
front
it
is
come
on
said
the
elder
brother
starting
forward
stiffen
your
feet
with
patience
i
say
again
exclaimed
the
younger
brother
know
you
that
the
old
demon
comes
up
the
pathway
below
here
he
will
not
hurt
them
until
he
gets
them
home
you
know
he
is
a
great
liar
and
a
great
flatterer
that
is
the
way
the
old
beast
catches
people
now
if
we
wait
here
we
will
surely
see
them
when
they
come
so
after
quarrelling
a
little
the
elder
brother
consented
to
sit
down
on
a
rock
which
overlooked
the
pathway
and
was
within
of
the
old
demon
s
cave
now
while
the
girls
were
washing
átahsaia
ran
as
fast
as
his
old
joints
would
let
him
until
the
two
girls
heard
his
mutterings
and
rattling
weapons
something
is
coming
sister
cried
the
younger
and
both
ran
toward
the
rocks
to
hide
again
but
they
were
too
late
the
old
demon
strode
around
by
another
way
and
suddenly
at
a
turn
came
face
to
face
with
them
glaring
with
his
bloodshot
eyes
and
waving
his
great
jagged
flint
knife
but
as
he
neared
them
he
lowered
the
knife
and
smiled
straightening
himself
up
and
approaching
the
frightened
ones
as
gently
as
would
a
young
man
the
poor
younger
sister
clung
to
the
elder
one
and
sank
moaning
by
her
side
for
the
smile
of
átahsaia
was
as
fearful
as
the
scowl
of
a
triumphant
enemy
or
the
laugh
of
a
rattlesnake
when
he
hears
any
old
man
tell
a
lie
and
thinks
he
will
poison
him
for
it
why
do
you
run
and
why
do
you
weep
so
asked
the
old
demon
i
know
you
i
am
ugly
and
old
my
pretty
maidens
but
i
am
your
grandfather
and
mean
you
no
harm
at
all
i
frightened
you
only
because
i
felt
certain
you
would
run
away
from
me
if
you
ah
faltered
the
elder
sister
immediately
getting
over
her
fright
we
did
not
know
you
and
therefore
we
were
frightened
by
you
come
sister
come
said
she
to
the
younger
brighten
your
eyes
and
thoughts
for
our
grandfather
will
not
hurt
us
don
t
you
see
but
the
younger
sister
only
shook
her
head
and
sobbed
then
the
demon
got
angry
what
are
you
blubbering
about
he
roared
raising
his
knife
and
sweeping
it
wildly
through
the
air
do
you
see
this
knife
this
day
i
will
cut
off
the
light
of
your
life
with
it
if
you
do
not
swallow
your
whimpers
get
up
oh
do
get
up
whispered
the
elder
sister
now
again
frightened
herself
surely
he
will
not
cut
us
off
just
now
if
we
obey
him
and
is
it
not
well
that
even
for
a
little
time
the
light
of
life
shine
though
it
shine
through
fear
and
sadness
than
be
cut
off
altogether
for
who
knows
where
the
trails
tend
that
lead
through
the
darkness
of
the
night
of
death
you
know
in
the
speech
of
the
rulers
of
the
world
and
of
our
ancients
a
man
s
light
was
cut
off
when
his
life
was
taken
and
when
he
died
he
came
to
the
of
life
one
of
the
figures
of
speech
meaning
the
gods
the
tried
to
rally
herself
and
rose
to
her
feet
but
she
still
trembled
now
my
pretty
maidens
my
own
granddaughters
even
said
the
old
demon
once
more
as
gently
as
at
first
i
am
most
glad
i
found
you
how
good
are
the
gods
for
i
am
a
poor
lone
old
man
all
my
people
are
here
he
sighed
like
the
hiss
of
a
yonder
above
is
my
home
pointing
over
his
shoulder
and
as
i
am
a
great
hunter
plenty
of
venison
is
baking
in
my
rear
room
and
more
than
i
can
eat
lo
it
makes
me
homesick
to
eat
alone
and
when
i
saw
you
and
saw
how
pretty
and
gentle
you
were
i
thought
that
it
might
be
you
would
throw
the
light
of
your
favor
on
me
and
go
up
to
my
house
to
share
of
my
abundance
and
drink
from
my
vessels
besides
i
am
so
old
that
only
now
and
then
can
i
get
a
full
jar
of
water
up
to
my
house
so
i
came
as
fast
as
i
could
to
ask
you
to
return
and
eat
with
reassured
by
his
kind
speech
the
elder
sister
hastened
to
say
of
course
we
will
go
with
our
grandfather
and
if
that
is
all
he
may
want
of
us
we
can
soon
fill
his
can
t
we
you
are
a
good
girl
said
the
old
demon
to
the
one
who
had
spoken
then
glaring
at
the
younger
sister
bring
that
fool
along
with
you
and
come
up
she
will
not
come
by
herself
she
has
more
bashfulness
than
sense
and
less
sense
than
my
knife
because
that
makes
the
world
more
wise
by
killing
off
he
led
the
way
and
the
elder
sister
followed
dragging
along
the
shrinking
the
old
demon
kept
talking
in
a
loud
voice
as
they
went
up
the
pathway
telling
all
sorts
of
entertaining
stories
until
as
they
neared
the
rocks
where
áhaiyúta
and
mátsailéma
were
waiting
the
two
heard
him
and
said
to
one
another
ahh
they
come
then
the
elder
brother
jumped
up
and
began
to
tighten
his
bow
but
the
younger
brother
muttered
sit
down
won
t
you
you
fool
átahsaia
s
ears
are
like
only
bigger
wait
now
till
i
say
ready
you
know
he
will
not
hurt
the
girls
until
he
gets
them
out
from
his
house
look
over
there
in
front
of
his
hole
do
you
see
the
flat
place
that
leads
along
to
that
deep
chasm
beyond
yes
replied
the
elder
brother
but
what
of
that
what
but
that
there
he
cuts
the
throats
of
his
captives
and
casts
their
bones
and
heads
into
the
depths
of
the
chasm
do
you
see
the
notch
in
the
stone
that
s
where
he
lets
their
blood
flow
down
and
for
that
reason
no
one
ever
discovers
his
tracks
now
stiffen
your
feet
with
patience
i
say
and
we
will
see
what
to
do
when
the
time
again
they
sat
and
waited
as
the
old
demon
and
the
girls
passed
along
below
the
elder
brother
again
started
and
would
have
shot
had
not
mátsailéma
held
him
back
you
fool
of
a
brother
elder
but
not
wiser
no
do
you
not
know
that
your
arrow
is
lightning
and
will
kill
the
maidens
as
well
as
the
monster
finally
the
demon
reached
the
entrance
to
his
cave
and
going
in
asked
the
girls
to
follow
him
laying
out
two
slabs
for
them
to
sit
on
now
sit
down
my
pretty
girls
and
i
will
soon
get
something
for
you
to
eat
you
must
be
going
to
the
rear
of
the
cave
he
broke
open
a
stone
oven
and
the
steam
which
arose
was
certainly
delicious
and
meaty
soon
he
brought
out
two
great
bowls
big
enough
to
feed
a
whole
dance
one
contained
meat
the
other
a
mess
resembling
pudding
now
let
us
eat
said
the
demon
seating
himself
opposite
and
at
once
diving
his
horny
fingers
and
scaly
hand
half
up
to
the
wrist
in
the
the
elder
sister
began
to
take
bits
of
the
food
to
eat
it
when
the
younger
made
a
motion
to
her
and
showed
her
with
horror
the
bones
of
a
little
hand
the
was
the
flesh
and
bones
of
little
children
then
the
two
girls
only
pretended
to
eat
taking
the
food
out
and
throwing
it
down
by
the
side
of
the
bowls
why
don
t
you
eat
demanded
the
demon
cramming
at
the
same
time
a
huge
mouthful
of
the
meat
bones
and
all
into
his
wide
throat
we
are
eating
said
one
of
the
girls
then
why
do
you
throw
my
food
away
we
are
throwing
away
only
the
well
the
bones
are
the
better
part
retorted
the
demon
taking
another
huge
mouthful
by
way
of
example
big
enough
to
make
a
grown
man
s
meal
oh
yes
he
added
i
forgot
that
you
had
baby
after
the
meal
was
finished
the
old
demon
said
let
us
go
out
and
sit
down
in
the
sun
on
my
terrace
perhaps
my
pretty
maidens
you
will
comb
an
old
man
s
hair
for
i
have
no
one
left
to
help
me
now
he
sighed
pretending
to
be
very
sad
so
showing
the
girls
where
to
sit
down
without
waiting
for
their
assent
he
settled
himself
in
front
of
them
and
leaned
his
head
back
to
have
it
combed
the
two
maidens
dared
not
disobey
and
now
and
then
they
pulled
at
a
long
coarse
hair
and
then
snapped
their
fingers
close
to
his
scalp
which
so
deceived
the
old
demon
that
he
grunted
with
satisfaction
every
time
at
last
their
knees
were
so
tired
by
his
weight
upon
them
that
they
said
they
were
done
and
átahsaia
rising
pretended
to
be
greatly
pleased
and
thanked
them
over
and
over
then
he
told
them
to
sit
down
in
front
of
him
and
he
would
comb
their
hair
as
they
had
combed
his
but
not
to
mind
if
he
hurt
a
little
for
his
fingers
were
old
and
stiff
the
two
girls
again
dared
not
disobey
and
sat
down
as
he
had
directed
uhh
how
the
old
beast
grinned
and
glared
and
breathed
softly
between
his
teeth
the
two
brothers
had
carefully
watched
everything
the
elder
one
starting
up
now
and
then
the
younger
remaining
quiet
suddenly
mátsailéma
sprang
up
he
caught
the
shield
the
had
given
him
the
shield
which
though
made
only
of
nets
and
knotted
cords
would
ward
off
alike
the
weapons
of
the
warrior
or
the
magic
of
the
wizard
holding
it
aloft
he
cried
to
áhaiyúta
stand
ready
the
time
is
come
if
i
miss
him
pierce
him
with
your
arrow
now
then
he
hurled
the
shield
through
the
air
swiftly
as
a
hawk
and
noiselessly
as
an
owl
it
sailed
straight
over
the
heads
of
the
maidens
and
settled
between
them
and
the
demon
s
face
the
shield
was
invisible
and
the
old
demon
knew
not
it
was
there
he
leaned
over
as
if
to
examine
the
maidens
heads
he
opened
his
great
mouth
and
bending
yet
nearer
made
a
vicious
bite
at
the
elder
one
ai
ai
my
poor
little
sister
alas
with
which
both
fell
to
sobbing
and
moaning
and
crouched
expecting
instantly
to
be
destroyed
but
the
demon
s
teeth
caught
in
the
meshes
of
the
invisible
shield
and
howling
with
vexation
he
began
struggling
to
free
himself
of
the
encumbrance
áhaiyúta
drew
a
shaft
to
the
point
and
let
fly
with
a
thundering
noise
that
rent
the
rocks
and
a
rush
of
strong
wind
the
shaft
blazed
through
the
air
and
buried
itself
in
the
demon
s
shoulders
piercing
him
through
ere
the
thunder
had
half
done
pealing
swift
as
mountain
sheep
were
the
leaps
and
light
steps
of
the
brothers
who
bounding
to
the
shelf
of
rock
drew
their
and
soon
softened
the
hard
skull
of
the
old
demon
with
them
the
younger
sister
was
unharmed
save
by
fright
but
the
elder
sister
lay
where
she
had
sat
insensible
hold
cried
mátsailéma
she
was
to
blame
but
then
lifting
the
swooning
maiden
in
his
strong
little
arms
he
laid
her
apart
from
the
others
and
breathing
into
her
nostrils
soon
revived
her
eyes
to
wisdom
day
have
we
through
the
power
of
sawanikia
seen
for
our
father
an
enemy
of
our
children
men
a
beast
that
caused
unto
fatherless
children
unto
menless
women
unto
womenless
men
who
thus
became
through
his
evil
will
tears
and
sad
thoughts
has
this
day
been
looked
upon
by
the
sun
and
laid
low
may
the
favors
of
the
gods
thus
meet
us
to
see
an
enemy
signifies
in
zuñi
mythology
to
take
his
life
thus
said
the
two
brothers
as
they
stood
over
the
gasping
still
struggling
but
dying
demon
and
as
they
closed
their
little
prayer
the
maidens
who
now
first
saw
whom
they
had
to
thank
for
their
deliverance
were
overwhelmed
with
gladness
yet
shame
they
exclaimed
in
response
to
the
prayer
they
indeed
thus
meet
you
and
ourselves
then
they
breathed
upon
their
hands
the
two
brothers
now
turned
toward
the
girls
look
ye
upon
the
last
enemy
of
men
said
they
whom
this
day
we
have
had
the
power
of
given
us
to
destroy
whom
this
day
the
father
of
all
our
father
the
sun
has
looked
upon
whose
light
of
life
this
day
our
weapons
have
cut
off
whose
path
of
life
this
day
our
father
has
divided
not
ourselves
but
our
father
has
done
this
deed
through
us
haste
to
your
home
in
héshokta
and
tell
your
father
these
things
and
tell
him
pray
that
he
must
assemble
his
priests
and
teach
them
these
our
words
for
we
divide
our
paths
of
life
henceforth
from
one
another
and
from
the
paths
of
men
no
more
to
mingle
save
in
spirit
with
the
children
of
men
but
we
shall
depart
for
our
everlasting
home
in
the
mountains
the
one
to
the
mountain
of
thunder
the
other
to
the
mount
of
the
beloved
to
guard
from
sunrise
to
sunset
the
land
of
the
of
earth
that
the
foolish
among
men
break
not
into
the
middle
country
of
earth
and
lay
it
waste
yet
we
shall
require
of
our
children
the
plumes
wherewith
we
dress
our
thoughts
and
the
forms
of
our
being
wherewith
men
may
renew
us
each
year
at
henceforth
two
stars
at
morning
and
evening
will
be
seen
the
one
going
before
the
other
following
the
the
one
áhaiyúta
his
herald
the
other
mátsailéma
his
guardian
warriors
both
and
fathers
of
men
may
the
trail
of
life
be
finished
ere
divided
go
ye
happily
the
maidens
breathed
from
the
hands
of
the
twain
and
with
bowed
heads
and
a
prayer
of
thanks
started
down
the
pathway
toward
the
town
of
the
cliffs
when
they
came
to
their
home
the
old
father
asked
whence
they
came
they
told
the
story
of
their
adventure
and
repeated
the
words
of
the
beloved
the
old
man
bowed
his
head
and
said
it
was
áhaiyúta
and
mátsailéma
then
he
made
a
prayer
of
thanks
and
cast
abroad
on
the
winds
white
meal
of
the
seeds
of
earth
and
shells
from
the
great
waters
of
the
world
the
pollen
of
beautiful
flowers
and
the
paints
of
war
it
is
well
he
said
four
days
hence
i
will
assemble
my
warriors
and
we
will
cut
the
paint
and
feather
them
and
place
them
on
high
mountains
that
through
their
knowledge
and
power
of
medicine
our
beloved
two
warriors
may
take
them
unto
now
when
the
maidens
disappeared
among
the
rocks
below
the
brothers
looked
each
at
the
other
and
laughed
then
they
shouted
and
áhaiyúta
kicked
átahsaia
s
ugly
carcass
till
it
gurgled
at
which
the
two
boys
shouted
again
most
hilariously
and
laughed
that
s
what
we
proposed
to
do
with
you
old
beast
they
cried
out
but
brother
younger
said
áhaiyúta
what
shall
be
done
with
him
now
let
s
skin
him
said
mátsailéma
so
they
set
to
work
and
skinned
the
body
from
foot
to
head
as
one
skins
a
fawn
when
one
wishes
to
make
a
then
they
put
sticks
into
the
legs
and
arms
and
tied
strings
to
them
and
stuffed
the
body
with
dry
grass
and
moss
and
where
they
set
the
thing
up
against
the
cliff
it
looked
verily
like
the
living
átahsaia
uhh
what
an
ugly
beast
he
was
said
mátsailéma
then
he
shouted
hihiho
and
almost
doubled
up
with
laughter
won
t
we
have
fun
with
old
grandmother
though
hurry
up
let
s
take
care
of
the
rest
of
him
they
cut
off
the
head
and
áhaiyúta
said
to
it
hast
been
a
liar
and
told
a
falsehood
for
every
life
thou
hast
taken
in
the
world
therefore
shall
thou
become
a
lying
star
and
each
night
thy
guilt
shall
be
seen
of
all
men
throughout
the
wide
he
twirled
the
bloody
head
around
once
or
twice
and
cast
it
with
all
might
into
the
air
muu
it
sped
through
the
spaces
into
the
middle
of
the
sky
like
a
spirt
of
blood
and
now
it
is
a
great
red
star
it
rises
in
and
tells
of
the
coming
morning
when
it
is
only
midnight
hence
it
is
called
great
lying
star
then
mátsailéma
seized
the
great
knife
and
ripped
open
the
abdomen
with
one
stroke
grasping
the
intestines
he
tore
them
out
and
exclaimed
have
devoured
and
digested
the
flesh
of
men
over
the
whole
wide
world
therefore
ye
shall
be
stretched
from
one
end
of
the
earth
to
the
other
and
the
children
of
those
ye
have
wasted
will
look
upon
ye
every
night
and
will
say
to
one
another
ah
the
entrails
of
him
who
caused
sad
thoughts
to
our
grandfathers
shine
well
tonight
and
they
will
laugh
and
sneer
at
whereupon
he
slung
the
whole
mass
aloft
and
it
stretched
from
one
end
of
the
world
to
the
other
and
became
the
great
of
the
skies
milky
way
lifting
the
rest
of
the
carcass
they
threw
it
down
into
the
chasm
whither
the
old
demon
had
thrown
so
many
of
his
victims
and
the
rattlesnakes
came
out
and
ate
of
the
flesh
day
after
day
till
their
fangs
grew
yellow
with
putrid
meat
and
even
now
their
children
s
fangs
are
yellow
and
poisonous
now
then
for
some
fun
shouted
mátsailéma
do
you
catch
the
old
bag
up
and
prance
around
with
it
a
little
and
i
will
run
off
to
see
how
it
áhaiyúta
caught
up
the
effigy
and
hiding
himself
behind
pulled
at
the
strings
till
it
looked
of
all
things
thinkable
like
the
living
átahsaia
himself
starting
out
for
a
hunt
for
they
threw
the
lion
skins
over
it
and
tied
the
bow
in
its
hand
excellent
excellent
exclaimed
the
boys
and
they
clapped
their
hands
and
and
till
they
were
sore
then
dragging
the
skin
along
they
ran
as
fast
as
they
could
down
to
the
plain
below
twin
mountain
the
sun
was
climbing
down
the
western
ladder
and
their
old
grandmother
had
been
looking
all
over
the
mountains
and
valleys
below
to
see
if
the
two
boys
were
coming
she
had
just
climbed
the
ladder
and
was
gazing
and
fretting
and
saying
oh
those
two
boys
terrible
pests
and
as
and
as
in
having
their
own
way
as
a
turtle
is
in
having
his
now
something
has
happened
to
them
i
knew
it
would
when
suddenly
a
frightened
scream
came
up
from
below
come
quick
help
help
the
voice
cried
as
if
in
anguish
uhh
exclaimed
the
old
woman
and
she
went
so
fast
in
her
excitement
that
she
tumbled
through
the
and
then
jumped
up
scolding
and
groaning
she
grabbed
a
poker
of
piñon
and
rushed
out
of
the
house
sure
enough
there
was
poor
mátsailéma
running
hard
and
calling
again
and
again
for
her
to
hurry
down
the
old
woman
hobbled
along
over
the
rough
path
as
fast
as
she
could
and
until
her
wind
was
blowing
shorter
and
shorter
when
suddenly
turning
around
the
crags
she
caught
sight
of
áhaiyúta
struggling
to
get
away
from
átahsaia
ai
o
i
knew
it
i
knew
it
cried
the
old
woman
and
she
ran
faster
than
ever
until
she
came
near
enough
to
see
that
her
poor
grandson
was
almost
tired
out
and
that
mátsailéma
had
lost
even
his
stiffen
your
feet
my
boys
wait
a
bit
puffed
the
old
woman
and
flying
into
a
passion
she
rushed
at
the
effigy
and
began
to
pound
it
with
her
poker
till
the
dust
fairly
smoked
out
of
the
dry
grass
and
the
skin
doubled
up
as
if
it
were
in
pain
mátsailéma
rolled
and
kicked
in
the
grass
and
áhaiyúta
soon
had
to
let
the
stuffed
demon
fall
down
for
sheer
laughing
but
the
old
woman
never
ceased
she
belabored
the
demon
and
cursed
his
cannibal
heart
and
told
him
that
was
what
he
got
for
chasing
her
grandsons
and
that
and
this
and
that
whack
whack
without
stopping
until
she
thought
the
monster
surely
must
be
dead
then
she
was
about
to
rest
when
suddenly
the
boys
pulled
the
strings
and
the
demon
sprang
up
before
her
seemingly
as
well
as
ever
again
the
old
woman
fell
to
but
her
strokes
kept
getting
feebler
and
feebler
her
breath
shorter
and
shorter
until
her
wind
went
out
and
she
fell
to
the
ground
how
the
boys
did
laugh
and
roll
on
the
ground
when
the
old
grandmother
moaned
alas
alas
this
day
my
day
light
is
cut
off
and
my
wind
of
life
fast
the
old
woman
covered
her
head
with
her
tattered
mantle
but
when
she
found
that
átahsaia
did
not
move
she
raised
her
eyes
and
looked
through
a
rent
there
were
her
two
grandsons
rolling
and
kicking
on
the
grass
and
holding
their
mouths
with
both
hands
their
eyes
swollen
and
faces
red
with
laughter
then
she
suddenly
looked
for
the
demon
there
lay
the
skin
all
torn
and
battered
out
of
shape
so
ho
you
pesky
wretches
that
s
the
way
you
treat
me
is
it
well
never
again
will
i
help
you
never
she
snapped
nor
shall
you
ever
live
with
me
more
whereupon
the
old
woman
jumped
up
and
hobbled
away
but
little
did
the
brothers
care
they
laughed
till
she
was
far
away
and
then
said
one
to
the
other
it
is
done
since
that
time
the
grandmother
has
gone
no
one
knows
where
but
áhaiyúta
and
mátsailéma
are
the
bright
stars
of
the
morning
and
evening
just
in
front
of
and
behind
the
himself
yet
their
spirits
hover
over
their
shrines
on
thunder
mountain
and
the
mount
of
the
beloved
they
say
or
linger
over
the
middle
of
the
world
forever
to
guide
the
games
and
to
guard
the
warriors
of
the
land
of
zuñi
thus
it
was
in
the
days
of
the
ancients
thus
shortens
my
story
illustration
carvings
the
hermit
mítsina
when
all
was
new
and
the
gods
dwelt
in
the
ancient
places
long
long
before
the
time
of
our
ancients
many
were
the
gods
some
destined
for
good
and
some
for
evil
or
for
the
doing
of
things
beneath
understanding
and
those
of
evil
intent
so
painfully
bad
were
they
to
become
that
not
in
the
company
and
council
of
the
precious
beloved
of
the
the
order
of
the
sacred
drama
could
they
be
retained
thus
it
happened
in
the
times
of
our
ancients
long
long
ago
that
there
dwelt
all
alone
in
the
cañon
of
the
pines
southeast
of
zuñi
mítsina
the
hermit
of
evil
understanding
he
therefore
it
had
been
said
to
him
by
the
gods
alone
shalt
thou
dwell
being
unwise
and
evil
in
thy
ways
until
thou
hast
through
much
happening
even
become
worthy
to
dwell
amongst
thus
it
was
that
mítsina
lived
alone
in
his
house
in
the
cañon
of
the
pines
sometimes
when
a
young
man
dressed
in
very
fine
apparel
wearing
his
collars
of
shell
and
turquoise
earrings
and
other
precious
things
which
were
plentiful
in
the
days
of
our
ancients
would
be
out
hunting
and
chanced
to
go
through
the
cañon
of
the
pines
and
near
to
the
house
of
mítsina
he
would
hear
the
sounds
of
gaming
from
within
for
being
alone
the
hermit
whiled
away
his
time
in
playing
at
the
game
of
sacred
arrows
or
forever
from
the
ceiling
of
his
house
there
hung
suspended
his
made
of
a
large
wicker
bowl
over
the
mouth
of
which
was
stretched
tightly
a
soft
buckskin
even
like
the
which
we
use
in
the
playing
of
today
and
which
you
know
are
suspended
with
the
downward
from
the
ceilings
of
the
gaming
rooms
in
the
topmost
houses
of
our
town
though
the
one
he
had
was
no
better
than
those
we
have
today
save
that
it
was
larger
and
handsomer
perhaps
yet
he
delighted
to
call
it
his
cloud
canopy
bethinking
himself
of
the
of
his
former
associates
the
gods
which
is
even
the
rounded
sky
itself
with
the
clouds
stretched
across
it
forever
upon
the
floor
of
his
house
there
lay
spread
a
great
buffalo
robe
the
skin
upward
dressed
soft
and
smooth
as
white
as
and
painted
with
the
symbols
and
counting
marks
of
the
game
even
as
our
own
but
he
delighted
to
call
it
his
sacred
terraced
plain
bethinking
himself
of
the
of
the
gods
which
is
even
the
outspread
earth
itself
bordered
by
terraced
horizons
and
diversified
by
mountains
valleys
and
bright
places
which
are
the
symbols
and
game
marks
whereby
the
gods
themselves
count
up
the
score
of
their
game
the
words
terrace
sacred
terrace
terraced
plain
and
the
like
wherever
they
occur
refer
to
the
figurative
expression
for
the
earth
in
the
zuñi
rituals
addressed
to
the
gods
where
they
are
used
as
more
nearly
conforming
to
the
usage
of
the
gods
the
symbol
of
the
earth
on
the
sacred
altars
is
a
terraced
or
zigzag
figure
or
decoration
and
the
same
figure
appears
in
their
carvings
and
other
ornamental
work
the
disgraced
god
mítsina
applied
the
term
to
the
robe
spread
out
as
the
bed
for
his
game
it
may
be
stated
in
further
explanation
that
the
country
in
which
the
zuñis
have
wandered
and
lived
for
unnumbered
generations
and
where
they
still
dwell
is
made
up
largely
of
mesas
or
mountains
or
elevations
rising
one
above
another
and
showing
as
terraces
on
the
horizon
beheld
at
great
distances
or
in
the
evening
these
mountain
terraces
are
mere
silhouettes
and
serve
to
exaggerate
the
zigzag
spaces
of
light
between
them
as
the
conventional
sacred
emblem
for
the
earth
is
a
terrace
outspread
or
upreaching
as
the
case
may
be
so
the
conventional
sacred
emblem
for
the
sky
is
an
inverted
terrace
to
the
gods
the
whole
earth
is
represented
as
having
seemed
so
small
that
they
invariably
spoke
of
it
as
the
terraced
plain
and
in
their
playing
of
this
game
they
are
supposed
to
have
used
it
as
the
bed
for
the
game
as
the
zuñi
people
used
the
outspread
buffalo
robe
for
the
purpose
hearing
these
sounds
of
the
game
in
passing
the
young
man
would
naturally
draw
near
and
listen
though
all
alone
every
time
he
made
a
good
throw
mítsina
would
exclaim
and
as
the
canes
struck
the
skin
of
the
above
it
would
sound
and
they
would
rattle
as
they
fell
on
the
robe
below
ha
ha
old
mítsina
would
exclaim
as
if
triumphantly
to
some
opponent
in
the
game
iyathtokyai
as
much
as
to
say
good
for
you
old
fellow
the
symbol
fell
uppermost
oh
the
young
man
would
exclaim
as
he
listened
oh
and
wishing
to
learn
more
about
the
matter
he
would
stealthily
climb
up
the
ladder
and
peer
down
through
the
old
mítsina
would
catch
sight
of
him
be
sure
of
that
and
greet
him
most
cordially
calling
to
him
come
in
come
in
my
fine
young
fellow
come
in
let
s
have
a
game
now
he
had
practised
so
long
that
he
had
acquired
more
skill
than
anyone
else
throughout
the
world
at
least
among
mortals
so
that
when
any
of
the
young
men
chanced
to
play
with
him
he
invariably
lost
poor
fellow
hanging
on
the
pole
along
the
north
side
of
mítsina
s
house
were
the
necklaces
embroidered
mantles
and
turquoises
and
all
sorts
of
treasures
which
he
had
won
in
this
way
and
as
many
on
the
western
side
on
the
southern
side
as
many
and
on
the
eastern
side
also
when
the
young
man
came
in
mítsina
would
continue
my
good
friend
sit
right
down
over
there
have
you
your
canes
today
if
the
young
man
said
yes
he
would
say
ha
very
or
if
he
said
no
never
mind
mítsina
would
say
here
are
some
producing
a
very
fine
set
of
polished
canes
the
young
man
being
thus
pressed
would
stake
perhaps
his
necklace
or
his
earrings
and
the
game
would
begin
losing
them
he
would
stake
his
clothing
his
bows
and
arrows
in
fact
everything
he
had
about
him
you
know
how
it
is
with
gamesters
when
they
have
lost
a
great
deal
and
wish
to
get
it
back
again
well
so
it
was
then
when
the
young
man
had
lost
everything
he
would
bow
his
head
on
his
hand
and
sit
thinking
then
old
mítsina
with
a
jolly
manner
would
say
bet
your
left
thigh
i
ll
put
all
you
have
lost
and
more
too
on
the
young
man
would
say
to
himself
with
a
sigh
of
relief
what
an
old
fool
you
are
and
reply
all
right
i
will
take
your
alas
the
one
thigh
he
bet
is
lost
then
the
other
goes
the
same
way
then
one
of
his
sides
and
arms
losing
which
he
bet
the
other
and
so
on
until
he
had
bet
away
his
whole
body
including
his
head
then
in
utter
despair
he
would
exclaim
do
with
me
as
thou
wilt
i
am
thy
and
old
mítsina
with
the
same
manner
would
catch
him
up
take
him
out
to
the
back
of
his
house
and
wring
his
neck
that
he
might
not
go
back
and
report
his
losses
to
his
people

again
some
other
young
man
would
be
passing
that
way
and
hearing
the
sound
made
by
the
solitary
player
and
being
attracted
thereby
would
be
drawn
in
the
same
way
into
the
game
would
lose
everything
and
old
mítsina
would
wring
his
neck
and
keep
his
treasures
thus
it
was
in
the
days
of
the
ancients
great
were
the
losses
of
the
young
men
and
many
of
them
perished
well
one
day
little
áhaiyúta
and
mátsailéma
the
of
peace
times
who
dwelt
as
you
know
where
their
shrine
now
stands
on
face
mountain
with
their
old
grandmother
went
out
hunting
rabbits
and
it
chanced
that
in
following
the
rabbits
along
the
cliffs
of
a
side
cañon
they
came
into
the
cañon
of
the
pines
near
where
the
house
of
mítsina
stood
presently
they
heard
the
sounds
of
his
game
hu
hu
the
old
fellow
would
exclaim
as
he
cast
his
canes
into
the
air
they
would
rattle
as
they
fell
on
the
skin
uh
exclaimed
áhaiyúta
the
elder
brother
younger
the
younger
listened
by
my
eyes
exclaimed
he
it
is
someone
playing
at
let
s
go
and
have
a
peep
at
so
they
climbed
the
ladder
and
peered
in
through
the
presently
old
mítsina
espied
them
and
called
out
ha
my
little
fellows
glad
to
see
you
today
how
are
you
come
in
come
in
i
am
dying
for
a
game
i
was
playing
here
all
by
the
two
little
clambered
down
the
ladder
and
old
mítsina
placed
blankets
for
them
invited
them
most
cordially
to
sit
down
and
asked
if
they
would
like
to
play
a
game
nothing
loth
they
seeing
all
the
fine
things
hanging
round
his
room
so
out
from
their
girdles
they
drew
their
for
those
as
you
know
they
always
carried
with
them
perhaps
i
have
not
told
you
that
even
the
old
mítsina
played
with
was
fringed
with
the
handsome
long
turquoise
earrings
which
he
had
won
and
even
under
the
robe
on
which
he
played
there
were
piled
one
over
another
in
a
great
flat
heap
the
finest
of
the
necklaces
gathered
from
those
whom
he
had
defeated
in
playing
and
then
slain
what
would
you
like
to
put
up
asked
the
old
fellow
pointing
around
his
room
particularly
to
the
fringed
with
turquoises
and
lifting
the
robe
and
showing
just
enough
of
the
necklaces
underneath
it
to
whet
the
appetites
of
the
little
we
ve
nothing
fine
enough
to
bet
for
these
things
said
they
ruefully
o
ho
cried
mítsina
no
matter
no
matter
at
all
my
boys
bet
your
bows
and
arrows
and
clothing
if
you
like
bet
everything
you
have
on
and
i
ll
put
up
that
poleful
there
on
the
north
side
of
my
good
good
tell
him
all
right
whispered
the
younger
brother
to
the
elder
so
the
elder
agreed
chuckling
to
himself
for
it
was
rarely
that
a
man
was
found
who
could
beat
the
little
in
a
game
and
they
began
their
playing
how
the
turquoises
rattled
as
they
threw
their
canes
how
the
canes
jingled
and
thumped
as
they
fell
on
the
robe
the
game
was
merry
and
long
and
well
played
on
both
sides
but
the
poor
little
lost
their
countenances
fell
but
old
mítsina
with
a
merry
twinkle
in
his
eyes
exclaimed
oh
pshaw
never
mind
never
mind
yes
said
the
two
but
how
in
the
world
are
we
ever
going
back
to
our
grandmother
in
this
plight
glancing
down
over
their
bare
bodies
for
they
had
bet
even
the
clothing
off
their
backs
what
else
can
we
bet
how
can
we
win
back
what
we
have
lost
bet
your
left
thighs
said
the
old
hermit
they
thought
a
moment
and
concluded
they
would
do
so
so
the
game
was
staked
again
and
begun
and
the
canes
rattled
merrily
but
they
lost
again
then
old
mítsina
suggested
that
they
bet
their
other
thighs
they
did
so
and
again
lost
then
he
suggested
they
should
bet
their
left
sides
hoping
forthwith
to
get
hold
of
their
hearts
but
the
young
were
crafty
the
elder
one
exclaimed
all
right
but
the
younger
one
said
goodness
as
for
you
you
can
bet
your
left
side
if
you
want
to
but
i
ll
bet
my
right
for
my
heart
is
on
my
left
side
and
who
ever
heard
of
a
man
betting
away
his
heart
just
as
you
like
said
mítsina
but
if
you
ll
bet
your
bodies
up
to
your
necks
i
will
stake
all
you
have
lost
and
all
i
have
besides
said
he
looking
around
on
his
fine
possessions
done
cried
the
and
again
they
played
and
again
lost
then
they
had
nothing
left
but
their
heads
and
ears
and
eyes
to
bet
finally
they
concluded
to
bet
these
also
for
said
they
to
one
another
what
good
will
our
heads
do
us
even
though
they
be
the
of
our
being
without
the
rest
they
played
again
but
the
poor
fellows
lost
their
heads
also
alas
alas
do
as
thou
wilt
with
us
exclaimed
the
little
with
rueful
countenances
old
mítsina
locking
them
up
in
a
small
recess
of
his
house
went
out
and
gathered
before
his
front
door
a
great
quantity
of
dry
wood
then
he
tied
the
little
fellows
hand
and
foot
and
laid
them
near
by
not
near
enough
to
burn
them
up
but
near
enough
so
that
they
would
scorch
and
lighted
the
fire
to
have
the
pleasure
of
roasting
them
when
they
began
to
brown
and
sizzle
a
little
they
writhed
and
howled
with
pain
but
they
were
tough
and
quite
bad
as
you
know
and
this
did
not
kill
them
who
can
hide
a
thing
from
the
eyes
of
the
gods
the
elder
brothers
of
these
two
foolish
little
áhaiyúta
and
mátsailéma
those
who
dwelt
on
thunder
mountain
became
aware
of
what
was
going
on
come
brother
younger
said
the
elder
strapping
on
his
quiver
and
taking
his
bow
in
hand
come
let
us
off
to
old
mítsina
s
house
and
teach
him
a
lesson
so
in
a
twinkling
they
were
climbing
down
the
mountain
speeding
across
the
wide
valley
and
threading
their
way
through
the
cañon
of
the
pines
mítsina
had
grown
tired
of
watching
the
poor
little
and
had
gone
in
to
have
another
little
game
and
there
he
was
pitching
his
and
talking
to
himself
as
usual
the
two
gods
hauled
their
unfortunate
brothers
away
from
the
fire
and
climbing
the
ladder
peered
in
mítsina
espied
them
and
as
usual
invited
them
in
to
a
game
with
as
jolly
an
air
as
his
own
they
accepted
his
challenge
and
sat
down
mítsina
offered
to
bet
all
his
fine
things
hanging
on
the
north
side
of
the
house
what
will
you
put
up
my
little
fellows
asked
he
if
you
will
include
those
ugly
little
devils
that
we
saw
sizzling
before
the
fire
when
we
came
in
we
will
bet
you
everything
we
have
with
us
said
they
good
good
haul
them
in
shouted
mítsina
the
scrambled
out
of
the
house
and
by
no
means
gently
dragged
their
wretched
little
brothers
in
by
the
heels
and
dumped
them
down
on
the
floor
to
show
their
indifference
sat
down
and
began
to
play
they
bet
their
weapons
holding
up
the
knife
of
war
which
they
carried
the
point
of
lightning
itself
fatal
in
power
splitter
of
mountains
and
overcomer
of
demons
and
men
alike
old
mítsina
when
told
of
the
power
of
the
weapons
became
doubtful
as
to
his
company
but
presently
fell
to
and
played
with
a
will
he
lost
then
he
put
up
all
the
rest
of
his
goods
hanging
on
the
other
side
of
the
room
again
he
lost
and
again
even
the
turquoises
hanging
from
the
the
necklaces
under
his
robe
and
the
things
he
played
with
and
getting
wild
with
excitement
sure
that
his
luck
would
return
followed
out
the
plan
he
had
so
often
suggested
to
others
and
bet
away
his
thighs
then
his
sides
and
arms
then
his
head
and
ears
excepting
his
eyes
and
last
of
all
his
very
eyes
themselves
each
time
the
young
won
the
old
gambler
let
his
hands
fall
by
his
sides
and
dropped
his
head
on
his
breast
sick
with
humiliation
and
chagrin
now
my
brother
said
the
elder
to
the
younger
what
shall
we
do
with
this
beast
i
don
t
know
said
the
other
we
can
t
kill
him
yet
if
we
leave
him
to
go
his
own
way
he
will
gamble
and
gamble
without
ceasing
and
make
no
end
of
trouble
suppose
we
make
a
good
man
of
how
asked
the
other
pluck
out
his
capital
exclaimed
the
first
so
while
one
of
them
held
the
old
fellow
down
the
other
gouged
out
his
eyes
and
with
pain
and
horror
he
utterly
forgot
in
unconsciousness
swooned
away
the
two
elder
set
their
younger
brothers
on
their
feet
and
all
four
of
them
joined
in
clearing
out
the
treasures
and
magnificent
possessions
which
mítsina
through
all
these
years
had
won
from
his
victims
and
these
they
took
away
with
them
that
by
their
sacred
knowledge
they
might
change
them
into
blessings
for
the
faithful
of
their
children
among
men
and
thus
return
as
it
were
what
had
been
lost
then
away
they
went
leaving
old
mítsina
still
as
witless
as
a
dead
man
to
his
fate
the
old
man
came
to
his
senses
and
raising
himself
up
tried
to
look
around
but
forsooth
he
could
not
see
what
in
the
world
has
happened
what
a
fearful
pain
i
have
in
my
temples
said
he
what
is
the
matter
is
it
night
then
gradually
his
situation
came
to
him
he
uttered
a
groan
of
pain
and
sorrow
and
putting
out
his
hand
felt
the
wall
and
raised
himself
by
it
then
he
crept
along
feeling
his
way
to
the
window
not
yet
quite
certain
whether
he
had
been
dreaming
all
this
and
it
was
still
night
or
whether
he
had
really
lost
everything
and
been
bereft
of
his
eyes
by
those
midgets
when
he
put
his
hand
into
the
window
however
he
felt
the
warm
sunlight
streaming
in
and
knew
that
it
was
still
day
and
that
it
was
all
true
in
feeling
there
he
chanced
to
touch
a
little
package
of
pitch
which
had
been
laid
in
the
window
he
felt
it
all
over
with
both
hands
but
could
not
quite
tell
what
it
was
then
he
put
it
against
his
cheek
but
was
still
uncertain
then
he
rubbed
it
and
smelt
of
it
pitch
pitch
as
i
live
said
he
i
have
often
lighted
this
when
it
was
dark
and
been
able
to
see
now
maybe
if
i
light
it
this
time
i
shall
be
able
to
see
he
felt
his
way
all
round
the
room
to
the
fireplace
and
after
burning
his
fingers
two
or
three
times
in
feeling
for
coals
he
found
a
sliver
and
held
it
in
the
coals
and
ashes
until
he
heard
it
begin
to
sputter
and
crackle
then
he
lighted
the
pitch
with
it
eyeless
though
he
was
the
fumes
from
this
medicine
of
the
woodlands
restored
to
him
a
kind
of
vision
good
cried
the
old
fellow
i
see
again
but
when
he
looked
around
he
saw
nothing
as
it
had
been
formerly
and
his
thoughts
reverted
to
the
great
city
of
the
gods
and
as
it
were
he
could
see
the
way
thither
so
he
turned
toward
his
door
and
with
a
sigh
gave
up
his
old
place
of
abode
relinquished
all
thought
of
his
possessions
gave
up
his
former
bad
inclinations
and
turned
westward
toward
the
city
of
the
gods
and
souls
as
he
went
along
holding
his
light
before
him
and
following
it
he
sang
a
mournful
song
the
birds
hearing
this
song
flocked
around
him
and
as
he
went
on
singing
exclaimed
to
one
another
ha
ha
the
old
wretch
he
has
lost
his
eyes
served
him
right
let
s
put
out
his
light
for
now
before
that
time
strange
as
it
may
seem
the
eagles
and
even
the
crows
were
as
white
as
the
foam
on
warring
waters
the
eagles
were
so
strong
that
they
thrust
the
other
birds
away
and
began
to
pounce
down
at
mítsina
s
light
trying
to
blow
it
out
with
their
wings
thluh
they
would
flap
into
the
light
but
still
it
would
not
go
out
and
they
only
singed
their
feathers
and
blackened
their
wings
and
tails
with
smoke
in
looking
at
one
another
they
saw
what
a
sad
plight
they
were
in
good
gracious
brothers
exclaimed
some
of
them
to
the
others
we
have
made
a
fine
mess
of
our
white
plumage
and
they
gave
it
up
then
the
crows
rushed
in
and
flapped
against
the
light
but
they
could
not
put
it
out
and
although
they
grew
blacker
and
blacker
they
would
not
give
it
up
so
they
became
as
black
as
crows
are
now
and
ever
since
then
eagles
have
been
speckled
with
brown
and
black
and
crows
have
been
black
even
to
the
tips
of
their
beaks
and
whenever
in
the
sacred
drama
dance
of
our
people
old
mítsina
appears
he
sings
the
doleful
song
and
carries
the
light
of
pitch
pine
he
goes
naked
with
the
exception
of
a
wretched
old
cloth
at
his
loins
and
he
wears
a
mask
with
deep
holes
for
eyes
blood
streaming
from
them

shortens
my
story
how
the
twins
of
war
and
chance

and
mátsailéma

introduction
heretofore
i
have
withheld
from
publication
such
single
examples
of
zuñi
as
the
following
in
order
that
the
completer
series
might
be
brought
forth
in
the
form
of
an
unbroken
collection
with
ample
introductory
as
well
as
supplementary
chapters
essential
to
the
proper
understanding
by
ourselves
of
the
many
distinctively
zuñi
meanings
and
conceptions
involved
in
the
various
allusions
with
which
any
one
of
them
teems
yet
to
avoid
encumbering
the
present
example
with
any
but
the
briefest
of
notes
i
must
ask
leave
to
refer
the
reader
to
the
more
general
yet
detailed
chapters
i
have
already
written
in
the
main
and
with
which
i
have
reason
to
hope
i
will
ere
long
be
able
to
present
the
tales
in
question
meanwhile
i
would
refer
likewise
to
the
essay
i
have
recently
prepared
for
the
thirteenth
annual
report
of
the
bureau
of
american
ethnology
on
creation
in
their
relation
to
primitive
dance
and
other
dramaturgic
ceremonies
ever
one
of
my
chief
was
waíhusiwa
of
the
priestly
kin
of
zuñi
he
had
already
told
me
somewhat
more
than
fifty
of
the
folk
tales
long
and
short
of
his
people
when
one
night
i
asked
him
for
only
one
more
story
of
the
wishing
to
evade
me
he
replied
with
more
show
than
sincerity
there
is
a
north
and
of
it
i
have
told
you
there
is
a
west
of
it
also
i
have
told
you
there
are
the
south
and
east
of
them
likewise
have
i
told
you
even
of
the
above
have
i
not
but
lately
told
you
of
the
youth
who
made
love
to
his
eagle
and
dwelt
apace
in
the
and
of
the
great
waters
you
have
been
told
of
the
hunter
who
married
the
and
journeyed
to
the
mountain
of
sunset
now
therefore
my
is
as
empty
as
the
of
a
lost
hunter
and
from
time
or
times
of
and
words
or
speeches
tales
tales
of
feel
in
the
bottom
of
it
then
interposed
old
pálowahtiwa
who
was
sitting
near
and
tell
him
of
the
listen
brother
younger
said
waíhusiwa
nonplussed
but
ever
ready
did
you
ever
hear
tell
of
the
people
who
could
not
digest
having
forsooth
no
proper
insides
wherewithal
to
do
so
did
you
ever
hear
of
them
brother
younger
nay
never
not
even
from
my
own
grandfathers
said
i
to
your
story
short
be
it
or
the
invariable
formula
for
beginning
a
folk
tale
is
by
the
raconteur
let
us
take
up
or
a
folk
tale
being
understood
to
this
the
auditors
or
listeners
respond
yea
again
by
the
raconteur
etc
let
us
tell
of
the
times
of
creation
when
etc
again
by
the
listeners
éso
yea
let
us
verily
be
it
éso
cool
your
éso
and
wait
till
zuñi
introduction
it
seems
so
the
words
of
the
grandfathers
say
that
in
the
underworld
were
many
strange
things
and
beings
even
villages
of
men
long
ago
but
the
people
of
those
villages
were
more
like
the
ghosts
of
the
dead
than
ourselves
yet
more
like
ourselves
than
are
the
ghosts
of
the
dead
for
as
the
dead
are
more
finished
of
being
than
we
are
they
were
less
so
as
smoke
being
hazy
is
less
fine
than
mist
which
is
filmy
or
as
green
corn
though
raw
is
soft
like
cooked
corn
which
is
done
like
the
dead
and
as
both
are
softer
than
ripe
corn
which
though
raw
is
hardened
by
age
as
we
are
of
meat
and
also
these
people
were
you
see
dead
in
a
way
in
that
they
had
not
yet
begun
to
live
that
is
as
we
live
in
the
daylight
fashion
and
so
it
would
seem
partly
like
ourselves
they
had
bodies
and
partly
like
the
dead
they
had
no
bodies
for
being
unfinished
they
were
unfixed
and
whereas
the
dead
are
like
the
wind
and
take
form
from
within
of
their
own
wills
these
people
were
really
like
the
smoke
taking
form
from
without
of
the
outward
touching
of
things
even
as
growing
and
unripe
grains
and
fruits
do
the
zuñi
classification
of
states
of
growth
or
being
is
as
elaborate
as
that
of
relative
space
in
their
mythology
both
extremely
detailed
and
systematic
yet
when
understood
purely
primitive
and
simple
the
universe
is
supposed
to
have
been
generated
from
haze
produced
by
light
of
the
out
of
darkness
the
observed
analogy
of
this
in
nature
is
the
appearance
of
haze
both
heat
and
steam
preceding
growth
in
springtime
the
appearance
of
the
world
of
growing
and
living
things
through
mist
seemingly
rising
out
of
the
darkness
each
morning
in
harmony
with
this
conception
of
the
universe
is
the
correlative
one
that
every
being
as
to
soul
at
least
passes
through
many
successive
states
of
becoming
always
beginning
as
a
haze
being
and
passing
through
the
raw
or
soft
the
formative
variable
fixed
or
done
and
finished
or
dead
states
whilst
the
condition
of
the
surpassing
beings
gods
may
be
any
of
these
at
will
or
there
are
many
analogies
of
this
observed
by
the
zuñi
likening
as
he
does
the
generation
of
being
to
that
of
fire
with
the
and
stick
the
most
obvious
of
these
is
the
appearance
in
volumes
of
or
haze
just
previously
to
ignition
and
its
immediate
disappearance
with
ignition
further
the
succession
of
beings
in
the
becoming
of
a
complete
being
may
be
regarded
as
an
orderly
personification
of
growth
phenomena
as
observed
in
plants
and
seeds
for
example
in
corn
which
is
characterized
by
no
fewer
than
thirteen
mystic
names
according
to
its
stages
of
growth
this
whole
subject
is
much
more
fully
and
conclusively
set
forth
in
the
writings
to
which
i
have
already
referred
well
in
consequence
it
was
passing
strange
what
a
state
they
were
in
bethink
ye
their
persons
were
much
the
reverse
of
our
own
for
wherein
we
are
hard
they
were
soft
pliable
wherein
we
are
most
completed
they
were
most
unfinished
for
not
having
even
the
organs
of
digestion
whereby
we
fare
lustily
food
in
its
solidity
was
to
them
destructive
whereas
to
us
it
is
sustaining
when
therefore
they
would
eat
they
dreaded
most
the
food
itself
taking
thought
not
to
touch
it
and
merely
absorbing
the
mist
thereof
as
fishes
fare
chiefly
on
water
and
birds
on
air
so
these
people
ate
by
gulping
down
the
steam
and
savor
of
their
cooked
things
whilst
cooking
or
still
hot
then
they
threw
the
real
food
away
forsooth
the
tale
now
the
twain
áhaiyúta
and
mátsailéma
were
ever
seeking
scenes
of
contention
for
what
was
deathly
and
dreadful
to
others
was
lively
and
delightful
to
them
so
that
cries
of
distress
were
ever
their
calls
of
invitation
as
to
a
feast
or
dance
is
the
call
of
a
priest
to
us
for
the
mythic
origin
of
these
two
chief
gods
under
the
sun
as
his
and
being
their
relation
to
chance
war
games
i
again
refer
the
reader
to
the
creation
on
a
day
when
the
world
was
quiet
they
were
sitting
by
the
side
of
a
deep
pool
they
heard
curious
sounds
coming
up
through
the
waters
as
though
the
bubbles
were
made
by
moans
of
the
waters
affrighted
uh
cried
the
elder
what
is
that
the
younger
brother
turned
his
ear
to
the
ground
and
listened
there
is
trouble
down
there
dire
trouble
for
the
people
of
the
underworld
are
shrieking
like
daft
warriors
and
wailing
like
what
can
be
the
matter
let
us
descend
and
see
just
so
said
áhaiyúta
then
they
covered
their
heads
with
their
turned
upside
down
and
shut
their
eyes
and
stepped
into
the
deep
pool
cord
or
cotton
shields
evidently
an
ancient
style
of
shield
still
surviving
in
the
form
of
sacrificial
of
the
priesthood
of
the
bow
but
the
shields
of
these
two
gods
were
supposed
to
have
been
spun
from
the
clouds
which
supporting
the
that
in
turn
supported
the
as
this
world
is
believed
to
be
supported
by
and
clouds
were
hence
possessed
of
the
power
of
floating
upward
when
turned
up
downward
when
reversed
now
we
are
in
the
dark
said
they
like
the
dark
down
there
well
then
by
means
of
the
dark
let
us
go
down
for
they
had
wondrous
power
had
those
twain
the
magic
of
thought
had
they
down
like
light
through
dark
places
they
went
dry
through
the
waters
straight
toward
that
village
in
the
underworld
whew
the
poor
wretches
are
already
dead
cried
they
and
rotting
for
their
noses
were
sooner
accustomed
to
the
dark
than
their
eyes
which
they
now
opened
we
might
as
well
have
spared
ourselves
the
coming
and
stayed
above
said
áhaiyúta
nay
not
so
said
mátsailéma
let
us
go
on
and
see
how
they
lived
even
if
they
are
very
well
said
the
elder
and
as
they
fared
toward
the
village
they
could
see
quite
plainly
now
for
they
had
made
it
dark
to
themselves
by
shutting
their
eyes
in
the
daylight
above
so
now
they
made
it
light
to
themselves
by
opening
their
eyes
in
the
darkness
below
and
simply
looking
it
was
their
way
you
know
well
well
said
mátsailéma
as
they
came
nearer
and
the
stench
doubled
look
at
the
village
it
is
full
of
people
the
more
they
smell
of
carrion
the
more
they
seem
alive
yes
by
the
chut
of
an
arrow
exclaimed
áhaiyúta
but
look
here
it
is
food
we
smell
cooked
food
all
thrown
away
as
we
throw
away
bones
and
because
they
are
too
hard
to
eat
and
profitless
withal
what
now
can
be
the
meaning
of
this
what
indeed
who
can
know
save
by
knowing
replied
the
younger
brother
come
let
us
lie
low
and
so
they
went
very
quietly
close
to
the
village
crouched
down
and
peered
in
some
people
inside
were
about
to
eat
they
took
fine
food
steaming
hot
from
the
and
placed
it
low
down
in
wide
trenchers
then
they
gathered
around
and
sipped
in
the
steam
and
savor
with
every
appearance
of
satisfaction
but
they
were
as
chary
of
touching
the
food
or
of
letting
the
food
touch
them
as
though
it
were
the
vilest
of
refuse
did
you
see
that
queried
the
younger
brother
by
the
delight
of
death
but
from
or
hurrah
or
how
delightful
and
a
death
hist
cried
the
elder
if
they
are
people
of
that
sort
feeding
upon
the
savor
of
food
then
they
will
hear
the
suggestions
of
sounds
better
than
the
sounds
themselves
and
the
very
demon
fathers
would
not
know
how
to
fare
with
such
people
or
to
fight
them
either
hah
but
already
the
people
had
heard
they
set
up
a
clamor
of
war
swarming
out
to
seek
the
enemy
as
well
they
might
for
who
would
think
favorably
of
a
sneaking
stranger
under
the
shade
of
a
watching
the
food
of
another
why
dogs
growl
even
at
their
own
offspring
for
the
like
of
that
where
who
what
is
it
cried
the
people
rushing
hither
and
thither
like
ants
in
a
shower
hah
there
they
are
there
quick
cried
they
pointing
to
the
twain
who
were
cutting
away
to
the
nearest
hillock
and
immediately
they
fell
to
singing
their
sang
they
as
they
ran
headlong
toward
the
two
and
then
they
began
shouting
tread
them
both
into
the
ground
smite
them
both
fan
them
out
this
like
so
many
of
the
songs
can
only
be
translated
etymologically
or
by
extended
paraphrasing
such
songs
are
always
jargonistic
either
archaic
imitative
or
adapted
from
other
languages
of
tribes
who
possibly
supplied
incidents
to
the
myths
themselves
but
they
are
like
the
latter
strictly
harmonized
with
the
native
forms
of
expression
and
phases
of
belief
but
the
twain
laughed
and
quickly
drew
their
arrows
and
loosed
them
amongst
the
crowd
it
tsok
sang
the
arrows
through
and
through
the
people
but
never
a
one
fell
why
how
now
is
this
cried
the
elder
brother
we
ll
club
them
then
said
mátsailéma
and
he
whiffed
out
his
and
sprang
to
meet
the
foremost
whom
he
pummelled
well
and
sorely
over
the
head
and
shoulders
yet
the
man
was
only
confused
he
was
too
soft
and
unstable
to
be
hurt
but
another
rushing
in
at
one
side
was
hit
by
one
of
the
and
fell
to
the
ground
like
smoke
driven
down
under
a
hawk
s
wing
hold
brother
i
have
it
hold
cried
áhaiyúta
then
he
snatched
up
a
bunch
of
dry
and
leaped
forward
two
ways
he
swept
the
faces
and
breasts
of
the
pursuers
lo
right
and
left
they
fell
like
bees
in
a
and
quickly
sued
for
mercy
screeching
and
running
at
the
mere
sight
of
the
you
fools
cried
the
brothers
why
then
did
ye
set
upon
us
we
came
for
to
help
you
and
were
merely
looking
ahead
as
becomes
strangers
in
strange
places
when
lo
you
come
running
out
like
a
mess
of
mad
flies
with
your
call
us
do
you
but
there
rest
fearless
we
hunger
give
us
to
so
they
led
the
twain
into
the
court
within
the
town
and
quickly
brought
steaming
food
for
them
they
sat
down
and
began
to
blow
the
food
to
cool
it
whereupon
the
people
cried
out
in
dismay
hold
hold
ye
heedless
strangers
do
not
waste
precious
food
like
that
for
shame
waste
food
ha
this
is
the
way
eat
said
they
and
clutching
up
huge
morsels
they
crammed
their
mouths
full
and
bolted
them
almost
whole
the
people
were
so
horrified
and
sickened
at
sight
of
this
that
some
of
them
sweated
furiously
which
was
their
way
of
spewing
whilst
others
stouter
of
thought
cried
hold
hold
ye
will
die
ye
will
surely
sicken
and
die
if
the
stuff
do
but
touch
ye
ho
ho
cried
the
twain
eating
more
lustily
than
ever
eat
thus
and
harden
yourselves
you
poor
soft
things
you
just
then
there
was
a
great
commotion
everyone
rushed
to
the
shelter
of
the
walls
and
houses
shouting
to
them
to
leave
off
and
follow
quickly
what
is
it
asked
they
looking
up
and
all
around
woe
woe
the
gods
are
angry
with
us
this
day
and
blowing
arrows
at
us
they
will
kill
you
both
hurry
a
big
puff
of
wind
was
blowing
over
scattering
slivers
and
straws
before
it
that
was
all
brother
said
the
elder
this
will
not
do
these
people
must
be
hardened
and
be
taught
to
eat
but
let
us
take
a
little
sleep
first
then
we
will
look
to
they
propped
themselves
up
against
a
wall
set
their
shields
in
front
of
them
and
fell
asleep
not
long
after
they
awakened
suddenly
those
strange
people
were
trying
to
drag
them
out
to
bury
them
but
were
afraid
to
touch
them
now
for
they
thought
them
dead
stuff
more
dead
than
alive
the
younger
brother
punched
the
elder
with
his
elbow
and
both
pretended
to
gasp
then
kept
very
still
the
people
succeeded
at
last
in
rolling
them
out
of
the
court
like
spoiling
bodies
and
were
about
to
mingle
them
with
the
refuse
when
they
suddenly
let
go
and
set
up
a
great
wail
shouting
war
murder
how
now
cried
the
twain
jumping
up
whereupon
the
people
stared
and
chattered
in
greater
fright
than
ever
at
seeing
the
dead
seemingly
come
to
life
what
s
the
matter
you
fool
people
cried
a
flock
of
jays
hear
that
said
the
villagers
hear
that
and
ask
what
s
the
matter
the
jays
are
coming
whoever
they
light
on
dies
run
you
two
murder
and
they
left
off
their
standing
as
though
chased
by
demons
on
one
or
two
of
the
hindmost
some
jays
alighted
they
fell
dead
as
though
struck
by
lightning
why
see
that
cried
the
elder
brother
these
people
die
if
only
birds
alight
on
them
hold
on
there
said
the
younger
brother
look
here
you
fearsome
things
so
they
pulled
hairs
from
some
they
had
and
made
snares
of
them
and
whenever
the
jays
flew
at
them
they
caught
them
with
the
nooses
until
they
had
caught
every
one
then
they
pinched
them
dead
and
took
them
into
the
town
and
roasted
them
this
is
the
way
said
they
as
they
ate
the
jays
by
morsels
and
the
people
crowded
around
and
shouted
look
look
why
they
eat
the
very
enemy
say
nothing
of
refuse
and
although
they
dreaded
the
couple
they
became
very
conciliatory
and
gave
them
a
fit
place
to
bide
in
the
very
next
day
there
was
another
alarm
the
two
ran
out
to
learn
what
was
the
matter
for
a
long
time
they
could
see
nothing
but
at
last
they
met
some
people
fleeing
into
the
town
chasing
after
them
was
a
with
earrings
of
onions
it
was
boiling
furiously
and
belching
forth
hot
wind
and
steam
and
spluttering
mush
in
every
direction
if
ever
so
little
of
the
mush
hit
the
people
they
fell
over
and
died
the
onion
here
referred
to
is
the
dried
southwestern
which
is
so
strong
and
indigestible
that
when
eaten
raw
and
in
quantity
gives
rise
to
great
distress
or
actually
proves
fatal
to
any
but
mature
and
vigorous
persons
this
of
course
explains
why
it
was
chosen
for
its
value
as
a
symbol
of
the
vigor
or
daylight
perfection
and
invincibility
of
the
twin
gods
cried
the
twain
ya
ya
as
if
were
made
to
make
people
afraid
whereupon
they
twitched
the
earrings
off
the
pot
and
ate
them
up
with
all
the
mush
that
was
in
the
pot
which
they
forthwith
kicked
to
pieces
vigorously
then
the
people
crowded
still
closer
around
them
wondering
to
one
another
that
they
could
vanquish
all
enemies
by
eating
them
with
such
impunity
and
they
begged
the
twain
to
teach
them
how
to
do
it
so
they
gathered
a
great
council
of
the
villagers
and
when
they
found
that
these
poor
people
were
only
half
finished
they
cut
vents
in
them
such
as
were
not
afraid
to
let
them
and
made
them
eat
solid
food
by
means
of
which
they
were
hardened
and
became
men
of
meat
then
and
there
instead
of
having
to
get
killed
after
the
manner
of
the
fearful
and
others
of
their
kind
beforetime
in
order
to
ascend
to
the
daylight
and
take
their
places
in
men
born
of
men
and
for
this
reason
behold
a
child
may
eat
only
of
until
his
cord
of
viewless
sustenance
has
been
severed
and
then
only
by
sucking
milk
or
soft
food
first
and
with
much
distress
behold
and
we
may
now
see
why
like
children
are
the
very
aged
childish
withal
not
only
toothless
too
but
also
sure
to
die
of
diarrhœa
if
they
eat
ever
so
little
save
the
soft
parts
and
broths
of
cooked
food
for
are
not
the
babes
from
the
world
and
are
not
the
aged
about
to
enter
the
world
where
cooked
food
unconsumed
is
never
heeded
by
the
fully
dead
dangerously
susceptible
tender
delicate
hazy
thus
shortens
my
story
the
cock
and
the
mouse
while
on
their
pilgrimage
to
the
ocean
of
sunrise
in
the
summer
of
three
zuñis
pálowahtiwa
waíhusiwa
and
héluta
with
cushing
were
entertaining
their
assembled
friends
at
with
folk
tales
those
related
by
the
indians
being
interpreted
by
cushing
as
they
were
uttered
when
cushing
s
turn
came
for
a
story
he
responded
by
relating
the
italian
tale
of
the
cock
and
the
mouse
which
appears
in
thomas
frederick
crane
s
popular
about
a
year
later
at
zuñi
but
under
somewhat
similar
circumstances
waíhusiwa
s
time
came
to
entertain
the
gathering
and
great
was
cushing
s
surprise
when
he
presented
a
zuñi
version
of
the
italian
tale
cushing
translated
the
story
as
literally
as
possible
and
it
is
here
reproduced
together
with
crane
s
translation
from
the
italian
in
order
that
the
reader
may
not
only
see
what
transformation
the
original
underwent
in
such
a
brief
period
and
how
well
it
has
been
adapted
to
zuñi
environment
and
mode
of
thought
but
also
to
give
a
glimpse
of
the
indian
method
of
italian
version
once
upon
a
time
there
were
a
cock
and
a
mouse
one
day
the
mouse
said
to
the
cock
friend
cock
shall
we
go
and
eat
some
nuts
on
yonder
tree
as
you
so
they
both
went
under
the
tree
and
the
mouse
climbed
up
at
once
and
began
to
eat
the
poor
cock
began
to
fly
and
flew
and
flew
but
could
not
come
where
the
mouse
was
when
it
saw
that
there
was
no
hope
of
getting
there
it
said
friend
mouse

you
know
what
i
want
you
to
do

a
the
mouse
went
and
threw
one
and
hit
the
cock

zuñi
version
thus
it
was
in
the
town
of
the
floods
abounding
long
ago
there
lived
there
an
old
woman
so
they
say
of
the
who
in
the
land
of
their
nativity
are
the
parental
brothers
of
the
mexicans
it
is
said
now
after
the
manner
of
that
people
this
old
woman
had
a
cock
which
she
kept
alone
so
that
he
would
not
fight
the
others
he
was
very
large
like
a
turkey
with
a
fine
sleek
head
and
a
on
his
breast
like
a
s
too
for
the
were
at
first
the
younger
brothers
of
the
turkeys
so
it
would
seem
venice
well
the
old
woman
kept
her
cock
in
a
little
corral
of
tall
stakes
sharp
at
the
top
and
wattled
together
with
rawhide
thongs
like
an
against
a
wall
only
it
had
a
little
wicket
also
fastened
with
thongs
now
try
as
he
would
the
old
cock
could
not
fly
out
for
he
had
no
chance
to
run
and
make
a
start
as
turkeys
do
in
the
wilds
yet
he
was
ever
trying
and
trying
because
he
was
always
anxious
for
worms
for
although
the
people
of
that
village
had
abundant
food
this
old
woman
was
poor
and
lived
mainly
on
wherefore
perforce
she
fed
the
old
cock
with
the
refuse
of
her
own
eatings
in
the
morning
the
old
woman
would
come
and
throw
this
refuse
food
into
the
corral
cage
under
the
wall
near
by
there
lived
a
mouse
he
had
no
old
grandmother
to
feed
him
and
he
was
particularly
fond
of
grain
food
when
having
eaten
his
fill
the
old
cock
would
settle
down
stiff
of
neck
and
not
looking
this
side
nor
that
but
sitting
in
the
sun
to
himself
the
little
mouse
would
dodge
out
steal
a
bit
of
tortilla
or
a
crumb
and
whisk
into
his
hole
again
being
sleepy
the
cock
never
saw
him
and
so
day
after
day
the
mouse
fared
sumptuously
and
grew
but
one
day
when
corn
was
ripe
and
the
cock
had
been
well
fed
and
was
settling
down
to
his
sitting
nap
the
mouse
came
out
and
stole
a
particularly
large
piece
of
bread
so
that
in
trying
to
push
it
into
his
hole
he
made
some
noise
and
moreover
had
to
stop
and
tunnel
his
doorway
larger
the
cock
turned
his
head
and
looked
just
as
the
mouse
was
working
his
way
slowly
in
and
espied
the
long
naked
tail
lying
there
on
the
ground
and
wriggling
as
the
mouse
moved
to
and
fro
at
his
digging
hah
by
the
grandmother
of
substance
it
is
a
worm
cackled
the
cock
and
he
made
one
peck
at
the
mouse
s
tail
and
bit
it
so
hard
that
he
cut
it
entirely
off
and
swallowed
it
at
one
gulp
the
mouse
squeaking
murder
scurried
down
into
his
and
fell
to
licking
his
tail
until
his
chops
were
all
pink
and
his
mouth
was
drawn
down
like
a
crying
woman
s
for
he
loved
his
long
tail
as
a
young
dancer
loves
the
glory
of
his
long
hair
and
he
cried
continually
tsu
tsu
weh
tsu
tse
yam
hok
and
thought
oh
that
shameless
great
beast
by
the
demon
of
i
ll
have
my
payment
of
him
for
he
is
worse
than
an
owl
or
a
they
eat
us
all
up
but
he
has
taken
away
the
very
mark
of
my
mousehood
and
left
me
to
mourn
it
i
ll
take
vengeance
on
him
will
i
so
from
that
time
the
mouse
thought
how
he
might
compass
it
and
this
plan
seemed
best
he
would
creep
out
some
day
all
maimed
of
tail
as
he
was
and
implore
pity
and
thus
perchance
make
friends
for
a
while
with
the
cock
so
he
took
and
made
a
plaster
of
it
with
and
applied
it
to
the
stump
of
his
tail
then
on
a
morning
holding
his
tail
up
as
a
dog
does
his
foot
when
maimed
by
a
cactus
he
crawled
to
the
edge
of
his
hole
and
cried
in
a
weak
voice
to
the
yoa
yoa
ya
mosa
motcho
wak
ya
oshe
wak
ya
ethl
hâ
asha
ni
ha
ha
na
yoa
ha
na
look
you
pity
pity
master
of
food
substance
of
my
maiming
of
my
hunger
i
am
all
but
dying
ah
me
pity
ah
me
whereupon
he
held
up
his
tail
which
was
a
safe
thing
to
do
you
see
for
it
no
longer
looked
like
a
worm
or
any
other
eatable
now
the
was
flattered
to
be
called
a
master
of
plenty
so
he
said
quite
haughtily
for
he
had
eaten
and
could
not
bend
his
neck
and
felt
proud
withal
come
in
you
poor
little
thing
and
eat
all
you
want
as
if
i
cared
for
what
the
like
of
you
could
eat
so
the
mouse
went
in
and
ate
very
little
as
became
a
polite
stranger
and
thanking
the
cock
bade
him
and
went
back
to
his
hole
he
came
again
and
this
time
he
brought
part
of
a
nutshell
containing
fine
white
meat
when
he
had
shouted
warning
of
his
coming
and
entered
the
corral
cage
he
said
comrade
father
let
us
eat
together
of
this
food
i
have
plenty
gathered
from
yonder
high
which
i
climb
every
autumn
when
the
corn
is
ripe
and
cut
the
nuts
therefrom
but
of
all
food
yours
i
most
relish
since
i
can
not
store
such
in
my
cellar
now
it
may
be
you
will
equally
relish
mine
so
let
us
eat
then
it
is
well
comrade
child
replied
the
cock
so
they
began
to
eat
but
the
cock
had
no
sooner
tasted
the
nut
than
he
fairly
chuckled
for
joy
and
having
speedily
made
an
end
of
the
kernel
fell
to
lamenting
his
hard
lot
alas
ah
me
he
said
my
grandmother
brings
me
on
rare
days
something
like
to
this
but
picked
all
too
clean
there
is
nought
eatable
so
nice
comrade
little
one
do
you
have
plenty
of
this
kind
did
you
say
oh
yes
replied
the
mouse
but
you
see
the
season
is
near
to
an
end
now
and
when
i
want
more
nuts
i
must
go
and
gather
them
from
the
tree
look
now
why
do
you
not
go
there
also
that
is
the
tree
close
ah
me
i
can
not
escape
woe
to
me
look
at
my
wings
said
the
cock
they
are
worn
to
bristles
and
as
to
the
beard
on
my
breast
my
chief
ornament
alas
it
is
all
crumpled
and
uneven
so
much
have
i
tried
to
fly
out
and
so
hard
have
i
pushed
against
the
bars
as
for
the
door
my
grandmother
claps
that
shut
and
fastens
it
tightly
with
thongs
be
you
sure
as
soon
as
ever
she
finishes
the
feeding
of
me
ha
ha
exclaimed
the
mouse
if
that
s
all
there
s
nothing
easier
than
to
open
that
look
at
my
teeth
i
even
crack
the
hard
nuts
with
these
scrapers
of
mine
wait
he
ran
nimbly
up
the
wicket
and
soon
gnawed
through
the
there
comrade
father
push
open
the
door
you
are
bigger
than
i
and
we
will
go
thanks
this
day
cried
the
cock
and
shoving
the
wicket
open
he
ran
forth
cackling
and
crowing
for
gladness
then
the
mouse
led
the
way
to
the
tree
up
the
trunk
he
ran
and
climbed
and
climbed
until
he
came
to
the
topmost
boughs
ha
the
nuts
are
fine
and
ripe
up
here
he
shouted
but
the
fluttered
and
flew
all
in
vain
his
wings
were
so
worn
he
could
not
win
even
to
the
lowermost
branches
oh
have
pity
on
me
comrade
child
cut
off
some
of
the
nuts
and
throw
them
down
to
me
do
my
wings
are
so
worn
i
can
not
fly
any
better
than
the
grandmother
s
old
dog
who
is
my
neighbor
over
be
patient
be
patient
father
exclaimed
the
mouse
i
am
cracking
a
big
one
for
you
as
fast
as
i
can
there
catch
it
and
he
threw
a
fat
nut
close
to
the
cock
who
gleefully
devoured
the
kernel
and
without
so
much
as
thanks
called
for
more
wait
father
said
the
mouse
there
stand
right
under
me
so
now
catch
it
this
is
a
big
one
saying
which
the
mouse
crawled
out
until
he
was
straight
over
the
cock
now
then
said
he
watch
in
front
and
he
let
fall
the
nut
it
hit
the
cock
on
the
head
so
hard
that
it
bruised
the
skin
off
and
stunned
the
old
so
that
he
fell
over
and
died
for
a
short
time
utterly
forgetting
mi
thlo
kô
thlo
kwa
shouted
the
mouse
as
he
hurried
down
the
tree
a
little
waiting
and
lo
what
my
foe
would
do
to
me
i
to
him
do
indeed
whereupon
he
ran
across
before
ever
the
cock
had
opened
an
eye
and
gnawed
his
bristles
off
so
short
that
they
never
could
grow
again
there
now
said
the
mouse
lo
thus
healed
is
my
heart
and
my
enemy
is
even
as
he
made
me
bereft
of
distinction
then
he
ran
back
to
his
cellar
satisfied
finally
the
cock
opened
his
eyes
ah
me
my
head
he
exclaimed
then
moaning
he
staggered
to
his
feet
and
in
doing
so
he
espied
the
nut
it
was
smooth
and
round
like
a
brown
egg
when
the
cock
saw
it
he
fell
to
lamenting
more
loudly
than
ever
oh
my
head
but
the
top
of
his
head
kept
bleeding
and
swelling
until
it
was
all
covered
over
with
welts
of
gore
and
it
grew
so
heavy
withal
that
the
thought
he
would
surely
die
so
off
to
his
grandmother
he
went
lamenting
all
the
way
hearing
him
the
grandmother
opened
the
door
and
cried
what
now
oh
my
grandmother
ah
me
i
am
murdered
he
answered
a
great
round
hard
seed
was
dropped
on
my
head
by
a
little
creature
with
a
short
tail
who
came
and
told
me
that
it
was
good
to
eat
and
oh
my
head
is
all
bleeding
and
swollen
by
the
light
of
your
favor
bind
my
wound
for
me
lest
alas
i
die
served
you
right
why
did
you
leave
your
place
knowing
better
cried
the
old
woman
i
will
not
bind
your
head
unless
you
give
me
your
very
bristles
of
manhood
that
you
may
remember
your
lesson
oh
take
them
grandmother
cried
the
cock
but
when
he
looked
down
alas
the
beard
of
his
breast
the
glory
of
his
kind
was
all
gone
ah
me
ah
me
what
shall
i
do
he
again
cried
but
the
old
woman
told
him
that
unless
he
brought
her
at
least
four
bristles
she
would
not
cure
him
and
forthwith
she
shut
the
door
so
the
poor
cock
slowly
staggered
back
toward
his
corral
hoping
to
find
some
of
the
hairs
that
had
been
gnawed
off
as
he
passed
the
little
lodge
of
his
neighbor
the
dog
he
caught
sight
of
old
fine
ha
thought
he
then
he
told
the
dog
his
tale
and
begged
of
him
four
hairs
only
four
you
great
pampered
give
me
some
bread
then
fine
bread
and
i
will
give
you
the
whereupon
the
cock
thought
and
went
to
the
house
of
a
trader
of
foodstuffs
and
he
told
him
also
the
tale
well
then
bring
me
some
wood
with
which
i
may
heat
the
oven
to
bake
the
bread
said
the
trader
of
foodstuffs
the
cock
went
to
some
woods
near
by
oh
ye
beloved
of
the
trees
drop
me
dry
branches
and
with
this
he
told
the
trees
his
tale
but
the
trees
shook
their
leaves
and
said
no
rain
has
fallen
and
all
our
branches
will
soon
be
dry
beseech
the
waters
that
they
give
us
drink
then
we
will
gladly
give
you
then
the
cock
went
to
a
spring
near
by
and
when
he
saw
in
it
how
his
head
was
swollen
and
he
found
that
it
was
growing
harder
he
again
began
to
lament
what
matters
murmured
the
beloved
of
the
waters
then
he
told
them
the
tale
also
listen
said
the
beings
of
water
long
have
men
neglected
their
duties
and
the
beloved
of
the
clouds
need
payment
of
due
no
less
than
ourselves
the
trees
the
the
dog
and
the
old
woman
behold
no
plumes
are
set
about
our
border
now
therefore
pay
to
them
of
thy
feathers
four
floating
plumes
from
under
thy
wings
and
set
them
close
over
us
that
seen
in
our
depths
from
the
sky
they
will
lure
the
beloved
of
the
clouds
with
their
breaths
thus
will
our
be
replenished
and
the
trees
watered
and
their
winds
in
the
trees
will
drop
thee
dead
branches
wherewith
thou
mayest
make
payment
and
all
will
be
forthwith
the
plucked
four
of
his
best
plumes
and
set
them
one
on
the
northern
one
on
the
western
one
on
the
southern
and
one
on
the
eastern
border
of
the
pool
then
the
winds
of
the
four
quarters
began
to
breathe
upon
the
four
plumes
and
with
those
breaths
of
the
beloved
came
clouds
and
from
the
clouds
fell
rain
and
the
trees
threw
down
dry
branches
and
the
wind
placed
among
them
grass
which
is
light
and
therefore
lightens
the
load
it
is
among
and
when
the
cock
returned
and
gathered
a
little
bundle
of
fagots
lo
the
made
it
so
light
that
he
easily
carried
it
to
the
who
gave
him
bread
for
which
the
dog
gave
him
four
bristles
and
these
he
took
to
the
old
grandmother
ha
exclaimed
she
now
child
i
will
cure
thee
but
thou
hast
been
so
long
that
thy
head
will
always
be
welted
and
covered
with
even
though
healed
still
it
must
ever
be
so
doing
right
keeps
right
doing
wrong
makes
wrong
which
to
make
right
one
must
even
pay
as
the
sick
pay
those
who
cure
them
go
now
and
bide
whither
i
bid
when
after
a
time
the
cock
became
well
lo
there
were
great
flabby
welts
on
his
head
and
blue
marks
on
his
temples
where
they
were
bruised
so
sore
now
listen
it
is
for
this
reason
that
ever
since
that
time
the
medicine
masters
of
that
people
never
give
cure
without
pay
never
for
there
is
no
virtue
in
medicine
of
no
value
ever
since
then
cocks
have
had
no
bristles
on
their
breasts
only
little
humps
where
they
ought
to
be
and
they
always
have
crests
of
meat
on
their
heads
and
even
when
a
hen
lays
an
egg
and
a
cock
sees
it
he
begins
to
as
the
ancient
of
them
all
did
when
he
saw
the
brown
nut
and
sometimes
they
even
pick
at
and
eat
these
seeds
of
their
own
children
especially
when
they
are
cracked
as
for
mice
we
know
how
they
went
into
the
in
olden
times
and
came
out
something
else
and
getting
smoked
became
with
long
bare
tails
but
that
was
before
the
cock
cut
the
tail
of
the
mouse
off
ever
since
he
cried
in
agony
tsu
yii
weh
tsu
like
a
child
with
a
burnt
finger
his
children
have
been
called
and
wander
wild
in
the
fields
hence
to
this
day
have
short
tails
and
hairy
and
their
chops
are
all
pink
and
when
you
look
them
in
the
face
they
seem
always
to
be
crying
thus
shortens
my
story
the
giant
a
tale
of
cañon
de
chelly
translator
s
introduction
deep
down
in
cañons
of
the
southwest
especially
where
they
are
joined
by
other
cañons
the
traveller
may
see
standing
forth
from
or
hugging
the
angles
of
the
cliffs
great
towering
needles
of
stone
weird
rugged
fantastic
oftentimes
single
as
often
like
gigantic
trees
with
lesser
trees
standing
beside
them
double
or
treble
seen
suddenly
at
a
turn
in
the
cañon
these
giant
stones
startle
the
gazer
with
their
monstrous
and
human
proportions
like
giants
indeed
at
bay
against
the
sheer
rock
walls
protecting
their
young
who
appear
anon
to
crouch
at
the
knees
of
their
fathers
or
cling
to
their
sides
few
white
men
behold
these
statuesque
stones
in
the
moonlight
or
in
the
gray
light
and
white
mists
of
the
morning
at
midday
they
seem
dead
or
asleep
while
standing
but
when
the
moon
is
shining
above
them
and
the
wanderer
below
looks
up
to
them
lo
the
moon
stands
still
and
these
mighty
crags
start
forth
advancing
noiselessly
his
back
is
frozen
and
even
in
the
yielding
sand
his
feet
are
held
fast
by
terror
a
delicious
ghostly
terror
withal
still
he
gazes
fascinated
and
as
the
shadow
of
the
moonlight
falls
toward
him
over
the
topmost
crest
lo
again
its
crown
is
illumined
and
circled
as
if
by
a
halo
of
and
back
and
forth
from
this
luminous
fillet
over
that
high
stony
brow
black
hair
seems
to
tumble
and
gather
again
beheld
in
the
when
the
mists
are
rising
slowly
and
are
waving
to
and
fro
around
the
giddy
columns
hiding
the
cliffs
behind
them
these
vast
pinnacles
seem
to
nod
and
to
waver
or
to
sway
themselves
backward
and
forward
all
as
silently
as
before
soon
when
the
sun
is
risen
and
the
mists
from
below
fade
away
the
wind
blows
more
mist
from
the
mesa
you
see
clouds
of
it
pour
from
the
cliff
edge
just
behind
and
above
these
great
towers
and
shimmer
against
the
bright
sky
but
as
soon
as
these
clouds
pass
the
they
are
lost
in
the
sunlight
around
them
lost
so
fast
as
yet
others
come
on
that
the
stone
giants
seem
to
drink
them
of
such
rocks
according
to
their
variety
and
local
surroundings
the
zuñis
relate
many
tales
which
are
so
ingenious
and
befitting
that
if
we
believed
as
the
zuñis
do
that
in
the
time
of
creation
when
all
things
were
young
and
soft
and
were
therefore
easily
fashioned
by
whatever
chanced
to
befall
them
into
this
thing
or
that
thing
into
this
plant
or
that
plant
this
animal
or
that
and
so
on
endlessly
through
a
dramatic
story
longer
than
shakespeare
or
the
bible
we
would
fain
believe
also
as
he
does
in
the
quaint
incidents
of
these
stories
of
the
time
when
all
things
were

will
fail
to
realize
how
as
this
introduction
endeavors
to
make
plainer
the
zuñi
poet
and
philosopher
of
olden
times
built
up
a
story
which
he
verily
believed
quite
sufficient
to
account
for
the
great
shaft
of
sandstone
and
its
many
details

f
häki

he
whose
hair
was
done
up
over

forehead
like
a

lived
among
the
great
cliffs
of
the
north
long
ago
when
the
world
was
new
he
was
a
giant
so
tall
that
men
called
him
or
the
a
devourer
of
men
was
he
men
were
his
meat
yea
and
a
drinker
of
their
very
substance
was
he
for
the
of
the
beloved
gods
and
souls
of
the
dead
whence
descend
rains
even
these
were
his
drink
wherefore
the
people
of
the
cliffs
sought
to
slay
him
and
hero
after
hero
perished
thuswise
wherefore
too
snow
ceased
in
the
north
and
the
west
rain
ceased
in

the

of
the

waters
of
the
valleys
below
were
dried
up

withered
in

men
hungered
and

in

came
the
twin
gods
of

áhaiyúta
and

who
in
play
staked
the
lives
of
foes
and
fierce
creatures
lo

with

she
ran
ahead
there
lay
häki
suto
his

over
the
trail
where
men
journeyed
great
like
the

and
branches
of

cast
down
by

were
his

arching
over
the
pathway
and
when
some

chanced
to
come
by
the

would
call
out
good
morning
and
bid
him
pass
right
along
i

continue
oh
so
politely

therefore
run

when
the
hunter
tried
to

häki

would
snatch
him
up
and
cast
him
over
the
cliff
to
be
eaten
by
the
young
the
spider
stepped
never
so
lightly
and
climbed
up
behind
his

ear
and
then
busily
wove
at

out

for
he
heard
the
coming

to
sing
as

wont
sometimes
häki

sprang
up
to

but
his
eyes
were
so
blinded
with
cobwebs
that
he
missed
them
and
feigned
to
fall
crying
ouch
my
poor

my
poor
back
pass
right
along
under
my
children
it
was
only
a
crick
in

back
ouch
oh
my
poor
back
but
they
whacked
him
over
the
head
and
stomach
till
he
stiffened
and
died
then
shouting
ho
they
shoved
him
over
the
cliff
the
navahos
say
that
the
grandmother
tied
him
there
by
the
hair
by
his
where
you
see
the
white
streaks
on
the
pillar
so
say
but
it
s
the

that
streak
the

is
the
way
when

fell
his
feet
drave
far
into
the
sands
and
the
rushed
in
to
the
aid
of
their
children
the
and
drifted
his
carcass
all
over
with
sand
whence
he
dried
and
hardened
to
stone
when
the
young
ones
saw
him
falling
they
forthwith
flocked
up
to
devour
him
making
loud
clamor
but
the
twain
seeing
this
made
after
them
too
and
twisted
the
necks
of
all
save
only
the
tallest
who
was
caught
in
the
sands
with
his
father
and
flung
them
aloft
to
the
winds
whereby
one
became
instantly
the
owl
who
twists
her
head
wholly
around
whensoever
she
pleases
and
stares
as
though
frightened
and
strangled
and
another
the
falcon
became
who
perches
and
nests
to
this
day
on
the
crest
of
his
father
the
giant
and
the

cry
ever

o

but
fearing
that
never
again
would
the
waters
refreshen
their
cañons
our

who
dwelt
in

fled
away
to

eastward
all

perished
aforetime
they
are
dead
in

in

she
was
a
little
child
come
forth
from
the
doorway
of
the
house
in
which
she
dwelt
no
one
there
in
that
town
had
ever
seen
her
even
her
own
townspeople
had
never
seen
her
now
day
after
day
at
when
the
sun
stood
in
the
he
would
look
down
from
the
sky
through
a
little
window
in
the
roof
of
her
house
and
he
it
was
who
instant
was
her
lover
and
who
descending
upon
the
luminously
yellow
trail
his
own
rays
created
would
talk
to
her
and
he
was
her
only
companion
for
she
knew
not
her
own
townspeople
neither
had
she
seen
them
since
she
was
a
child
none
save
only
her
parents
ever
saw
her
wonder
what
the
cacique
s
child
looks
like
the
people
would
say
to
one
another
she
never
comes
out
no
one
has
seen
her
since
she
was
a
little
and
so
at
last
they
schemed
to
get
a
look
at
her
one
said
i
have
it
let
us
have
a
dance
for
her
then
it
may
be
she
will
deign
to
come
the
young
man
who
spoke
was
chief
of
the
dances
and
why
should
he
not
suggest
such
a
thing
so
his
friends
and
followers
agreeing
they
began
to
make
plumes
of
macaw
feathers
beautiful
plumes
they
were
for
the
plume
dance
they
set
a
day
and
on
that
day
in
the
morning
they
danced
with
music
and
song
in
the
plaza
before
the
house
of
the
great
where
the
girl
lived
they
looked
along
the
top
of
the
house
in
vain
the
girl
was
not
there
only
her
old
parents
sat
on
the
roof
oh
i
m
so
thirsty
cried
the
chief
of
the
dance
for
he
it
was
who
wanted
to
see
the
girl
run
right
in
and
get
a
drink
said
the
girl
s
old
ones
so
the
young
man
climbed
the
ladder
and
went
into
the
first
room
there
was
no
water
there
then
he
went
into
the
second
room
but
there
was
no
water
there
then
into
the
third
room
but
still
he
found
no
water
he
looked
all
around
but
saw
nothing
of
the
s
daughter
all
the
same
she
was
back
in
the
fourth
room
sitting
there
just
as
if
no
dance
were
going
on
in
the
plaza
weaving
away
at
her
beautiful
trays
of
colored
splints
well
the
young
man
went
back
they
finished
their
dance
but
no
one
saw
anything
of
the
s
daughter
and
when
the
dancers
all
returned
to
their
ceremonial
chamber
they
said
to
one
another
alas
although
we
danced
for
her
she
came
not
out
to
see
us
now
in
reality
the
sun
who
was
her
lover
and
came
down
each
day
on
a
ray
of
his
own
light
to
visit
her
loved
her
so
much
he
would
not
that
she
should
come
forth
from
her
house
and
be
seen
of
men
therefore
he
set
an
eagle
upon
the
in
a
great
cage
to
watch
her
he
was
a
very
wise
old
eagle
he
could
understand
every
word
that
the
people
said
and
he
it
was
that
she
fed
and
watered
from
day
to
day
now
the
dancers
in
the
ceremonial
chamber
asked
what
shall
we
do
why
let
us
dance
again
said
the
chief
of
the
dances
and
if
we
do
not
succeed
yet
they
did
as
he
said
but
with
no
better
success
than
before
so
at
last
the
two
warrior
priests
of
the
bow
grew
angry
and
although
they
were
the
girl
s
father
s
own
warriors
they
ordered
the
warrior
festival
or
dance
surely
said
they
she
will
come
forth
and
if
not
let
her
perish
for
how
can
she
refuse
the
delight
of
the
great
where
each
young
man
dances
and
masks
himself
according
to
his
fancy
so
one
night
the
two
warriors
went
out
and
called
to
the
people
to
make
ready
and
be
happy
for
in
four
days
they
should
dance
the
when
they
had
done
calling
they
descended
and
the
people
said
to
one
another
surely
she
will
come
out
when
we
dance
the
for
she
will
be
delighted
with
it
and
we
shall
yet
see
her
she
was
very
beautiful
when
she
was
a
little
then
both
of
the
warriors
climbed
to
the
top
of
thunder
mountain
where
áhaiyúta
and
his
brother
mátsailéma
the
gods
of
war
and
their
grandmother
lived
in
the
middle
of
the
summit
as
they
approached
the
presence
of
the
two
gods
they
exclaimed
the
gods
replied
our
fathers
how
is
it
that
ye
are
these
many
days
they
asked
and
the
twain
replied
we
are
happy
come
in
sit
down
and
they
placed
a
couple
of
stools
for
the
warriors
what
is
it
that
ye
would
of
us
they
continued
for
it
would
be
strange
if
ye
came
up
to
our
house
for
true
it
is
replied
the
warriors
it
is
in
our
hearts
as
your
two
chosen
children
as
the
of
our
nation
that
our
people
should
be
made
happy
as
the
days
of
the
year
go
by
and
we
therefore
think
over
all
the
beautiful
dances
and
now
and
then
command
that
the
most
fitting
of
them
shall
appear
now
our
children
the
people
of
the
home
of
the
eagles
are
anxious
to
see
our
child
the
daughter
of
the
who
has
not
come
forth
from
her
house
and
whom
we
have
never
seen
since
she
was
a
little
girl
we
have
thought
to
order
your
dance
of
the
and
we
would
that
without
fail
our
daughter
should
be
made
to
come
forth
or
else
die
therefore
our
fathers
we
have
come
to
consult
ye
and
to
ask
your
aha
cried
the
twain
then
ye
are
anxious
that
this
should
be
are
ye
yes
they
replied
well
it
shall
come
to
pass
as
ye
wish
it
and
the
girl
must
die
if
she
come
not
forth
at
the
bidding
of
the
aha
ejaculated
they
both
thanks
yea
it
shall
be
as
ye
wish
make
our
days
for
us
name
the
times
for
preparation
and
we
shall
be
with
ye
to
lead
the
the
first
time
our
dance
will
come
forth
and
the
second
time
our
dance
will
come
forth
and
the
third
time
our
dance
will
come
forth
but
the
fourth
time
our
dance
comes
forth
it
will
happen
as
ye
wish
it
it
will
certainly
be
finished
as
ye
wish
well
thanks
we
go
go
ye
said
the
gods
to
their
children
and
they
went
the
eagle
was
very
unhappy
with
all
this
he
knew
it
all
for
he
understood
everything
that
was
said
next
morning
he
hung
his
head
at
the
window
with
great
sadness
so
the
girl
after
she
had
eaten
her
morning
meal
took
some
dainty
bits
to
the
window
and
said
why
are
you
so
unhappy
see
i
have
brought
you
some
food
eat
i
will
not
eat
i
can
not
eat
replied
the
eagle
why
not
asked
she
i
will
not
harm
you
i
am
happy
i
love
you
just
as
much
as
alas
alas
my
mother
said
the
eagle
it
is
not
with
thoughts
of
myself
that
i
am
unhappy
but
your
father
s
two
are
anxious
that
their
children
shall
be
made
happy
and
their
children
the
people
of
our
town
under
the
mountain
are
longing
to
see
you
they
have
said
to
one
another
that
you
never
come
forth
they
have
never
seen
you
therefore
they
have
ordered
the
that
you
may
be
tempted
out
they
went
up
to
the
home
of
áhaiyúta
and
his
younger
brother
where
they
live
with
their
grandmother
on
the
top
of
thunder
mountain
and
the
two
gods
have
said
to
them
it
shall
come
to
pass
as
ye
wish
therefore
they
will
dance
and
on
the
fourth
day
of
their
dancing
it
shall
come
to
pass
as
they
wish
it
indeed
it
shall
happen
my
poor
mother
that
you
shall
be
no
more
alas
i
can
do
nothing
you
can
do
nothing
why
should
i
tarry
longer
with
you
you
must
loosen
my
bonds
and
let
me
as
you
like
said
the
girl
i
suppose
it
must
be
as
you
then
she
loosened
the
eagle
s
bonds
and
straight
as
the
pathway
of
an
arrow
away
he
flew
upward
into
the
sky
even
toward
the
zenith
where
the
sun
rested
at
and
whither
he
soon
arrived
himself
thou
comest
said
the
sun
i
do
my
father
how
art
thou
these
many
days
said
the
eagle
to
the
sun
happy
here
sit
there
was
a
blanket
already
placed
for
him
and
thereupon
he
sat
but
he
never
looked
to
the
right
nor
to
the
left
nor
yet
about
the
s
splendid
home
he
said
not
a
word
he
only
drooped
his
head
so
sad
was
he
what
is
it
my
child
asked
the
sun
i
suppose
thou
hast
some
errand
else
why
shouldst
thou
come
surely
it
is
not
for
nothing
that
thou
wouldst
come
so
far
to
see
quite
true
answered
the
eagle
alas
my
child
alas
my
mother
day
after
day
down
in
the
home
under
the
mountain
the
people
dance
that
they
may
tempt
her
forth
yet
she
has
never
appeared
so
her
father
s
are
angry
and
have
at
last
been
to
see
the
twain
in
their
home
on
thunder
mountain
and
the
twain
have
commanded
that
soon
it
shall
come
to
pass
as
the
people
wish
or
that
our
beautiful
maiden
shall
perish
even
tomorrow
it
shall
be
so
have
the
twain
said
and
when
the
fourth
dance
comes
out
it
shall
come
to
pass
and
our
beautiful
maiden
shall
be
no
more
thus
have
the
twain
said
i
can
not
enrich
my
mother
the
daughter
of
the
thy
beautiful
child
with
words
of
advice
with
aid
of
mine
own
will
hence
come
i
unto
thee
what
shall
i
do
what
shalt
thou
do
repeated
the
sun
i
know
it
is
all
as
thou
hast
said
know
i
not
all
these
things
the
twain
whose
powers
are
surpassed
only
by
mine
own
have
they
not
commanded
that
it
shall
be
what
shalt
thou
do
but
descend
at
once
tell
her
to
bathe
herself
and
put
on
her
finest
garments
tomorrow
morning
then
when
the
time
comes
mount
her
upon
thy
shoulders
and
bear
her
up
to
me
only
possibly
thou
wilt
have
the
great
good
fortune
to
reach
my
house
with
her
possibly
in
thy
journey
hither
it
shall
come
to
be
alas
as
the
twain
have
said
for
have
not
they
said
it
should
be
and
are
they
not
above
all
things
else
powerful
well
we
ll
try
to
but
i
will
watch
thee
when
thou
art
about
to
reach
the
well
i
go
said
the
eagle
rising
very
well
responded
the
sun
happily
mayest
thou
and
the
eagle
began
to
descend
meanwhile
the
daughter
of
the
opened
the
and
placed
a
sacred
half
full
of
water
on
the
floor
where
the
sunlight
would
shine
into
it
and
where
it
would
reflect
the
sky
and
there
she
sat
looking
intently
down
into
the
water
the
eagle
came
in
sight
and
she
saw
his
shadow
in
the
water
just
then
the
sun
drew
his
shield
from
his
face
oh
how
hot
it
was
down
there
on
the
earth
the
sky
was
ablaze
with
light
and
no
one
dared
to
look
at
it
and
the
sands
grew
so
hot
that
they
burned
the
moccasins
of
those
who
walked
upon
them
everybody
ran
into
the
houses
and
the
eagle
spread
his
wings
and
gently
descended
for
he
too
was
hot
and
when
he
came
near
to
the
house
the
girl
let
him
in
and
welcomed
him
thou
comest
father
said
she
he
only
drooped
his
head
and
flapped
his
wings
unable
even
to
speak
so
hot
was
he
she
saw
that
he
was
near
to
fainting
therefore
she
fanned
him
made
cool
wind
for
him
with
the
basket
tray
and
her
mantle
and
sprinkled
cold
water
upon
his
head
thou
hast
been
to
the
home
of
our
father
she
asked
when
he
had
recovered
yes
replied
the
eagle
what
has
he
advised
that
we
should
do
asked
she
this
said
the
eagle
tomorrow
morning
at
the
dawn
of
day
thou
wilt
arise
and
bathe
thyself
then
at
sunrise
thou
shalt
put
on
thy
finest
garments
the
dance
will
come
forth
and
then
it
will
come
forth
the
second
time
and
the
third
time
and
again
it
will
come
the
fourth
time
then
i
will
mount
thee
upon
my
shoulders
and
bear
thee
away
toward
the
sun
who
will
be
waiting
for
us
it
may
be
that
we
shall
have
the
good
fortune
to
reach
his
home
and
it
may
be
that
we
shall
get
only
a
little
way
when
everything
shall
come
to
pass
unhappily
and
thou
wilt
be
no
that
is
what
he
said
to
her
it
grew
night
the
girl
collected
all
the
that
she
had
made
for
her
father
s
sacred
plumes
these
by
the
she
spread
out
and
then
began
to
divide
them
into
different
heaps
now
her
parents
who
were
sitting
in
the
next
room
heard
her
until
it
was
late
at
night
and
they
said
to
each
other
wonder
what
it
is
that
keeps
our
daughter
up
so
the
old
arose
and
entered
her
room
my
child
art
thou
not
at
rest
yet
asked
he
no
replied
she
i
am
dividing
the
trays
i
have
made
for
thee
these
said
she
pointing
to
a
heap
of
yellow
ones
shall
pertain
to
the
these
the
blue
to
the
the
red
to
the
land
of
the
south
the
white
to
the
east
the
variegated
to
the
upper
regions
and
the
black
to
the
regions
below
for
tomorrow
beloved
father
thou
shalt
see
me
no
it
is
well
said
the
father
for
he
was
a
great
priest
and
knew
the
will
of
the
gods
and
to
this
he
always
said
it
is
well
what
therefore
should
i
say
so
the
old
man
left
her
then
as
morning
approached
she
bathed
herself
and
the
eagle
looking
down
said
my
child
my
mother
lie
down
and
rest
thyself
for
we
are
about
to
undertake
a
long
journey
never
fear
i
will
wake
thee
at
the
right
so
she
lay
down
and
slept
the
eagle
perched
himself
above
her
and
watched
for
the
dawn
the
great
star
arose
then
he
knew
that
the
sun
would
soon
follow
it
and
he
said
mother
arise
dress
thyself
for
the
time
is
near
at
outside
on
the
called
the
two
to
their
children
hasten
hasten
prepare
for
the
dance
hasten
hasten
eat
for
the
dance
hasten
hasten
our
children
all
then
the
girl
went
into
another
room
and
brought
forth
her
finest
dresses
and
these
garment
after
garment
she
put
on
not
one
dress
but
many
upon
her
shoulders
she
placed
four
mantles
of
embroidered
cotton
then
she
said
to
the
eagle
wait
a
moment
i
have
yet
to
think
of
our
children
in
the
home
of
the
therefore
she
brought
forth
her
of
fine
meal
with
which
she
had
been
accustomed
to
powder
her
face
there
was
meal
of
the
yellow
corn
the
blue
the
red
the
white
the
speckled
and
the
black
see
said
she
as
she
regarded
the
various
vessels
of
meal
my
children
by
means
of
these
shall
ye
beautify
flesh
by
means
of
these
be
precious
against
evil
by
means
of
these
shall
ye
finish
preciously
your
roads
of
life
i
am
to
be
no
more
far
off
and
to
an
unknown
region
go
i
possibly
i
may
reach
it
and
live
probably
not
reach
it
and
die
these
do
i
leave
as
your
inheritance
my
children
the
maiden
here
addresses
mankind
generally
then
the
eagle
descended
the
drum
began
to
sound
outside
the
dance
was
coming
for
the
first
time
mind
you
not
the
fourth
then
said
the
eagle
as
he
lowered
himself
place
thyself
upon
my
back
grasp
me
by
the
and
the
girl
did
as
she
was
bidden
she
reclined
herself
lengthwise
on
the
back
of
the
eagle
and
grasped
with
her
left
hand
his
shoulders
now
place
one
foot
on
one
of
my
thighs
and
the
other
on
the
she
placed
one
foot
on
one
of
his
thighs
and
the
other
on
the
other
and
the
eagle
spread
his
tail
and
raised
it
that
she
might
not
fall
off
all
ready
asked
he
as
the
drum
of
the
coming
dance
sounded
outside
yes
said
the
girl
and
they
arose
open
the
wicket
and
the
eagle
spread
his
wings
and
away
off
up
into
the
sky
he
sprang
with
the
maiden
round
and
round
round
and
round
they
circled
in
the
sky
but
those
below
saw
nothing
as
they
danced
in
the
shadows
of
the
great
houses
the
dancers
retired
then
they
came
forth
again
again
they
retired
and
came
forth
then
the
girl
said
father
slower
let
me
sing
a
farewell
song
to
my
people
my
children
of
earth
that
they
may
know
i
am
the
eagle
spread
his
wings
and
sailed
gently
through
the
air
as
the
maiden
sang
then
the
people
in
the
plaza
below
heard
the
song
and
said
alas
alas
ye
twain
said
they
to
the
two
gods
who
led
the
dance
our
mother
our
child
away
off
through
the
skies
goes
she
ye
are
fools
that
ye
have
let
her
escape
and
deceive
us
some
listened
to
the
song
and
learned
it
others
did
not
for
the
third
time
the
dancers
came
forth
once
more
have
we
to
dance
said
the
two
gods
where
are
they
now
in
the
said
the
people
take
it
easily
my
child
said
the
eagle
once
more
are
they
to
come
forth
possibly
we
will
yet
have
the
great
good
fortune
to
reach
the
home
of
our
and
they
sped
along
through
the
air
nearer
and
nearer
to
the
home
of
the
while
the
dancers
below
danced
harder
and
harder
many
so
joyful
that
they
listened
not
to
the
complainings
of
the
people
around
but
danced
only
more
vigorously
then
the
dancers
retired
and
came
out
for
the
fourth
and
last
time
in
the
van
danced
the
two
gods
their
faces
blackened
with
the
paint
of
war
their
hands
bearing
bows
and
arrows
with
which
to
destroy
the
daughter
of
the
yes
they
were
almost
there
now
the
eagle
s
heart
was
high
with
hope
when
the
two
gods
below
reached
the
center
of
the
plaza
they
turned
to
the
people
and
asked
where
are
they
where
have
they
gone
there
they
are
in
the
skies
almost
there
replied
the
people
humph
responded
the
gods
suppose
they
almost
there
they
shall
never
reach
the
home
of
our
father
now
then
hurry
brother
younger
exclaimed
the
elder
with
which
hand
wilt
thou
draw
the
arrow
with
thy
hand
my
right
said
the
younger
very
well
with
thy
hand
my
left
said
the
elder
the
twin
children
of
the
sun
were
in
the
days
of
creation
the
benignant
guardians
of
men
but
when
the
world
became
filled
with
envy
and
war
they
were
changed
by
the
eight
gods
of
the
storms
into
warriors
more
powerful
than
all
monsters
gods
or
men
the
elder
one
was
the
younger
hence
the
form
of
expression
here
used
so
they
drew
their
arrows
to
the
heads
sang
the
arrows
as
they
shot
through
the
air
soon
they
reached
the
home
of
the
sun
crossed
one
another
over
his
face
and
shot
downward
more
swiftly
than
ever
toward
the
coming
eagle
and
the
maiden
alas
my
mother
my
child
said
the
sun
as
the
arrows
flew
past
him
and
from
him
thou
art
no
and
the
arrows
shot
downward
on
their
course
sang
the
arrow
of
the
elder
god
as
it
pierced
the
back
of
the
girl
and
entered
her
heart
sang
the
arrow
of
the
younger
as
it
struck
in
the
middle
of
her
back
alas
my
mother
my
mother
cried
the
eagle
it
is
over
alas
alas
said
he
as
she
released
her
hold
and
fainting
he
left
her
to
fall
through
the
air
over
and
over
this
way
and
that
fell
the
beautiful
maiden
and
as
the
people
strained
their
eyes
nearer
and
nearer
to
the
town
neath
the
mountain
she
fell
soon
over
and
over
this
way
and
that
she
came
falling
even
with
the
top
of
the
mountain
then
the
people
rushed
past
one
another
out
of
the
plaza
toward
the
place
where
they
thought
she
would
strike
and
just
over
there
below
the
home
of
the
eagles
where
the
waters
of
the
coyote
gush
forth
from
the
fell
the
beautiful
maiden
then
there
were
born
twin
children
two
wee
infants
who
rolled
off
into
the
rubbish
and
were
concealed
under
sticks
and
stones
down
rushed
the
people
and
an
acoma
spectator
seized
her
body
mine
cried
he
triumphantly
as
he
raised
the
body
above
him
thine
cried
the
people
for
they
had
lost
the
beautiful
maiden
ours
cried
the
acomas
one
to
another
who
had
come
to
witness
the
dances
great
good
fortune
this
day
has
smiled
on
and
they
bore
her
body
away
to
their
pueblo
in
the
east
now
under
the
other
end
of
thunder
mountain
was
the
home
of
the
badgers
and
an
old
badger
who
lived
there
was
out
hunting
after
the
people
had
again
gathered
in
the
city
he
passed
near
the
waters
of
the
coyote
and
heard
the
voices
of
the
infants
crying
among
the
rubbish
ah
said
he
i
hear
the
cry
of
children
my
little
boys
my
little
girls
cried
he
whichever
ye
may
be
and
he
hastily
searched
and
found
them
where
they
were
rolling
about
and
crying
among
the
refuse
twins
cried
he
boys
somebody
has
left
them
here
soon
he
will
come
back
to
reclaim
them
let
me
walk
away
for
a
few
so
he
walked
all
around
but
found
no
traces
of
the
parents
only
the
tracks
of
many
men
who
had
gathered
near
mine
said
he
as
he
trotted
back
and
with
soft
grass
he
rubbed
them
till
they
were
free
from
the
mud
and
refuse
thanks
thanks
splendid
children
have
i
and
boys
at
that
and
when
i
am
older
grown
they
will
take
from
me
the
cares
of
the
chase
goodness
thanks
nothing
but
boys
shall
be
my
children
so
he
rubbed
them
dry
and
clean
with
more
soft
grass
and
they
stopped
crying
then
he
took
some
dry
grass
and
made
a
bundle
and
put
them
in
it
and
started
off
for
his
home
in
the
red
hills
the
old
was
up
on
top
of
their
house
looking
around
running
back
and
forth
and
jumping
in
and
out
of
her
doorway
hai
said
she
thou
comest
yes
hurry
said
the
old
badger
come
down
and
meet
what
have
you
asked
the
as
she
ran
down
to
meet
him
what
have
i
said
the
old
badger
but
a
couple
of
wee
little
children
here
take
them
and
carry
them
up
to
the
so
the
old
woman
took
the
bundle
of
grass
and
opened
it
and
began
to
fondle
the
children
o
my
poor
little
children
poor
little
babes
said
she
ah
stop
playing
with
them
and
hurry
along
commanded
the
old
badger
so
the
old
woman
hurried
up
to
their
doorway
as
fast
as
possible
and
ran
in
the
old
badger
followed
and
she
said
to
him
where
in
the
world
did
you
get
these
little
children
why
replied
he
i
had
the
greatest
luck
in
the
world
i
was
out
hunting
you
know
and
found
these
two
little
fellows
down
in
coyote
cañon
just
this
side
of
those
men
s
houses
they
re
boys
both
of
them
when
they
grow
up
old
wife
perhaps
they
can
hunt
for
us
and
then
i
shall
rest
myself
from
the
labors
of
the
hunt
with
plenty
of
meat
for
you
and
me
every
day
of
the
year
what
are
you
standing
there
for
said
he
why
don
t
you
go
and
get
them
something
to
eat
and
make
them
a
bed
oh
yes
responded
the
old
woman
my
poor
little
children
so
she
made
a
little
nest
at
the
bottom
of
the
hole
and
laid
them
on
it
then
she
ran
and
fetched
some
ears
and
picking
the
kernels
off
made
some
gruel
of
them
and
fed
the
little
fellows
so
the
boy
babies
ate
till
they
kicked
their
heels
with
satisfaction
and
that
night
the
old
took
one
in
her
arms
and
slept
with
it
and
the
old
slept
with
the
other
now
every
day
they
grew
as
much
as
the
children
of
men
do
in
a
year
so
that
in
eight
days
they
were
as
large
and
knew
as
much
as
children
usually
do
in
eight
years
there
was
no
little
animal
that
they
could
not
kill
unfailingly
for
they
were
the
children
of
the
sun
you
know
but
alas
they
grew
weary
of
killing
birds
around
their
doorway
and
their
old
father
kept
telling
them
every
morning
never
to
go
out
of
sight
of
their
house
and
the
old
woman
kept
watching
them
always
for
fear
that
they
would
run
off
and
get
lost
or
somebody
would
find
and
claim
them
yes
they
grew
impatient
of
this
they
wanted
to
kill
and
cottontails
but
they
could
not
get
near
enough
to
them
so
one
night
when
the
old
badger
came
home
they
said
to
him
father
come
now
do
make
us
some
bows
and
arrows
so
that
we
can
hunt
rabbits
and
you
and
mother
can
have
all
that
you
want
to
all
right
replied
the
old
man
and
the
next
day
he
went
off
to
the
cañon
of
the
woods
and
somehow
he
managed
to
cut
down
a
small
oak
and
get
a
lot
of
branches
for
arrows
he
brought
these
home
and
that
night
with
a
piece
of
flint
little
by
little
he
managed
to
make
each
of
the
boys
a
bow
and
some
arrows
but
when
he
tried
to
put
feathers
on
the
arrows
he
was
very
awkward
for
you
know
badgers
don
t
have
fingers
like
men
so
he
had
to
take
a
single
feather
for
each
arrow
and
split
it
and
twist
it
around
the
butt
of
the
shaft
that
very
night
do
you
know
it
snowed
yes
a
great
deal
of
snow
fell
and
the
little
fellows
looked
out
and
said
to
each
other
and
to
the
old
badgers
now
then
tomorrow
we
will
go
o
mother
make
a
lunch
for
us
they
exclaimed
where
are
you
going
asked
the
old
woman
we
are
going
out
among
the
hills
and
down
on
the
plains
where
the
trees
grow
to
hunt
o
my
poor
little
boys
what
will
you
do
you
will
freeze
to
death
for
you
have
no
clothes
and
no
wool
grows
on
your
well
mother
we
re
tough
we
will
get
up
tomorrow
and
wait
until
the
sun
shines
warm
then
we
can
go
how
in
the
world
will
you
carry
your
food
you
have
no
blanket
to
wrap
it
oh
you
just
make
some
answered
the
boys
and
string
them
on
a
little
stick
and
we
can
take
hold
of
the
middle
of
the
stick
and
carry
them
just
as
well
as
cried
the
old
woman
listen
so
she
made
the
and
strung
them
on
little
sticks
and
the
two
boys
went
to
bed
but
they
couldn
t
sleep
very
well
being
so
impatient
to
go
hunting
rabbits
and
they
kept
waking
each
other
and
peeping
out
to
see
how
long
it
would
be
before
daylight
in
the
morning
the
old
badger
got
up
early
and
collected
a
lot
of
bark
which
he
rubbed
until
it
was
soft
and
then
he
wove
the
boys
each
a
curious
pair
of
moccasins
that
would
come
up
to
the
knees
so
the
elder
brother
put
on
his
moccasins
and
ran
out
into
the
snow
exclaimed
he
first
rate
so
the
other
little
boy
put
on
his
bark
moccasins
and
they
took
their
strings
of
and
bows
and
arrows
and
started
off
as
fast
as
they
could
well
they
went
off
among
the
hills
at
the
foot
of
thunder
mountain
it
was
only
a
little
while
ere
they
struck
a
rabbit
trail
and
the
first
arrow
they
shot
killed
the
rabbit
so
they
kept
on
hunting
until
they
had
a
large
number
of
rabbits
and
began
to
get
tired
although
there
was
snow
on
the
ground
the
sun
was
very
warm
so
they
soon
forgot
all
about
it
until
they
began
to
grow
hungry
and
then
they
looked
up
and
saw
that
it
was
because
the
sun
was
resting
in
the
so
they
went
up
on
top
of
a
high
hill
and
carried
their
rabbits
there
one
by
one
to
find
a
place
where
the
snow
was
shallow
here
they
brushed
a
space
clear
of
the
snow
and
depositing
the
rabbits
sat
down
to
eat
their
which
they
laid
on
a
bundle
of
grass
while
they
sat
there
eating
the
sun
looked
down
and
pitied
his
two
poor
little
children
wait
a
bit
said
he
to
himself
i
ll
go
down
and
talk
to
the
little
fellows
and
help
so
by
his
will
alone
he
descended
and
lo
he
stood
there
on
the
earth
just
a
little
way
from
the
two
boys
grand
beautiful
sublime
upon
his
body
were
garments
of
embroidered
cotton
fringed
leggings
covered
his
knees
and
he
was
girt
with
girdles
buckskins
of
bright
leather
protected
his
feet
bracelets
and
strings
of
wampum
ornamented
his
neck
and
arms
turquoise
earrings
hung
from
his
ears
beautiful
plumes
waved
over
his
head
his
long
glossy
hair
was
held
with
cords
of
many
colors
into
which
great
plumes
of
macaw
feathers
were
stuck
fearful
wonderful
beautiful
he
stood
suddenly
one
of
the
boys
looked
up
and
saw
the
standing
there
blood
cried
he
to
the
other
somebody
s
coming
where
asked
the
other
where
right
over
there
he
exclaimed
then
the
sun
with
stately
step
approached
them
dazzling
their
eyes
with
his
beauty
and
his
magnificent
dress
so
the
poor
little
fellows
huddled
together
and
crouched
their
knees
close
to
their
bodies
for
they
had
no
clothes
on
and
watched
him
trembling
until
he
came
near
then
one
of
them
said
faintly
comest
thou
as
though
he
just
remembered
it
yea
i
do
my
children
said
the
sun
how
are
ye
these
many
days
happy
responded
they
but
they
were
almost
frightened
out
of
their
wits
and
kept
looking
first
at
the
and
then
at
each
other
my
children
said
the
tenderly
ye
are
my
own
children
i
gave
ye
both
but
they
only
gazed
at
him
not
believing
what
he
said
ye
are
both
mine
own
children
he
repeated
is
that
so
replied
they
yea
that
is
true
and
i
saw
ye
here
and
pitied
ye
so
i
came
to
speak
with
ye
and
to
help
exclaimed
they
but
they
still
looked
at
each
other
and
at
the
and
did
not
believe
him
yea
ye
are
verily
my
children
continued
the
sun
i
am
your
own
father
around
thunder
mountain
there
is
a
city
of
men
it
is
called
the
home
of
the
eagles
and
there
once
lived
a
beautiful
maiden
who
never
left
her
home
but
was
always
shut
in
her
room
day
after
day
at
midday
just
at
this
time
i
came
down
and
visited
her
in
my
own
sunlight
and
a
great
eagle
always
stood
and
watched
her
now
the
townspeople
grew
anxious
to
see
her
so
they
danced
day
after
day
their
most
beautiful
dances
hoping
to
entice
her
to
come
forth
but
she
never
looked
out
so
her
father
s
warriors
went
to
the
home
of
áhaiyúta
and
his
younger
brother
mátsailéma
where
they
lived
with
their
grandmother
on
the
middle
of
thunder
mountain
and
the
twain
said
that
they
would
go
with
them
and
compel
her
to
come
forth
therefore
one
day
they
went
and
led
the
dance
of
the
óinahe
yet
although
they
danced
four
times
she
would
not
come
forth
but
tried
to
escape
to
my
home
in
the
heavens
on
the
back
of
her
eagle
so
the
two
gods
shot
her
and
she
fell
down
the
cañon
then
it
was
that
ye
two
my
children
were
born
and
rolled
among
the
bushes
now
the
people
ran
down
from
the
village
to
strive
for
your
mother
s
body
and
an
acoma
got
her
and

call

grandmother

a
woman
comes
out
to

wood
and
she
will
reply
that
she
gets
the
wood
to
make
a
light

why
she
wishes
a
light
and
she
will
say
to

that
day
after
day
she
lights
a
fire
in
her
ceremonial
chamber
and
that
when
she
reaches
home
with
her
wood
the
young
men
of
her
clan
come
together
and
give
her
food
and
that
at
night
she
takes
the
wood
to
the
ceremonial
chamber
and
then
sits
on
a
stone
seat
by
the
side
of
the
fireplace
and
builds
a
fire
that
the
young
men
gather
in
the
chamber
and
prepare
for
a
dance
and
when
they
are
ready
she
takes
the
bones
of
your
mother
from
a
niche
in
the
west
end
of
the
chamber
and
distributes
them
among
the
young
men
who
carry
them
in
the
dance
she
gives
the
skull
to
the
first
one
the
to
the
next
the
ribs
to
another
and
so
on
until
they
all
have
bones
to
carry
in
the
dance
when
the
dance
is
over
she
goes
around
and
takes
all
the
bones
back
again
and
replaces
them
in
the
niche
then
the
young
men
depart
for
their
homes
but
some
of
them
sleep
there
in
the
chamber
and
then
she
lies
down
to
sleep
and
to
keep
guard
over
the
bones
now
when
she
has
told
ye
these
things
ye
must
ask
her
if
that
is
all
if
she
says
yes
kill
her
then
skin
her
and
the
younger
brother
must
wave
his
hands
over
her
skin
and
put
it
on
and
he
will
look
just
like
the
old
woman
and
he
must
climb
up
to
the
town
of
the
acomas
and
enter
and
do
just
as
the
old
woman
said
that
she
did
now
after
the
dance
is
over
and
he
has
taken
back
all
of
the
bones
and
replaced
them
in
the
niche
he
must
lie
down
and
pretend
to
sleep
and
some
of
the
young
men
will
go
home
others
will
sleep
there
when
they
all
begin
to
snore
he
must
gather
all
the
bones
and
the
two
dried
eyes
and
the
heart
of
his
mother
and
bring
them
away
as
fast
as
ever
he
can
to
where
his
brother
waits
and
when
he
gets
there
lo
she
will
come
to
life
again
and
be
just
as
she
was
before
she
was
killed
by
the
twain
now
mind
ye
must
not
leave
a
single
bone
nor
any
part
for
if
ye
do
your
mother
will
lack
that
when
she
comes
to
life
very
well
replied
the
boys
we
will
do
as
you
have
told
us
certainly
we
now
i
have
given
ye
with
your
birth
the
power
to
slay
all
game
but
mind
that
not
a
single
rabbit
nor
deer
nor
antelope
nor
mountain
sheep
nor
elk
though
he
be
the
finest
ye
have
ever
seen
shall
ye
slay
for
in
that
case
ye
shall
perish
with
your
so
the
two
boys
promised
they
would
not
of
course
we
will
not
said
the
younger
brother
when
one
s
father
commands
him
can
he
disobey
come
hither
said
the
to
the
younger
brother
stand
so
the
little
boy
did
as
he
was
bidden
lift
up
thy
then
the
drew
off
the
moccasin
of
bark
and
put
beautiful
fringed
leggings
upon
it
and
replaced
the
bark
moccasins
with
buskins
like
his
own
and
tied
up
the
leggings
with
garters
and
dressed
him
as
he
was
dressed
and
placed
a
beautiful
quiver
upon
his
back
but
the
poor
little
boys
were
and
their
hair
was
tangled
and
matted
over
their
heads
then
the
turned
himself
about
as
if
to
summon
some
unseen
messenger
and
created
a
great
warm
cloud
of
mist
with
which
he
cleansed
the
boys
and
lo
their
skins
became
smooth
and
clear
and
their
hair
fell
down
their
backs
in
wavy
masses
then
the
arranged
the
younger
brother
s
hair
and
placed
a
plume
therein
like
his
own
and
beautiful
plumes
on
his
head
there
said
he
to
the
elder
look
at
thy
younger
but
the
poor
little
fellow
was
covered
with
shame
and
dared
only
steal
glances
at
his
brother
and
the
then
the
dressed
the
other
like
the
first
exclaimed
they
as
they
looked
at
each
other
and
at
the
you
are
just
like
him
they
said
to
each
other
but
still
they
did
not
call
him
father
then
they
fell
to
conversing
why
he
must
be
our
father
said
they
to
each
other
mother
s
face
has
a
black
streak
right
down
the
middle
of
it
and
father
s
face
is
just
like
it
except
that
his
chin
is
then
they
knew
that
the
sun
was
their
father
and
they
thanked
him
for
his
goodness
then
said
the
to
them
mind
what
i
have
told
ye
my
children
i
must
go
to
my
home
in
the
heavens
happy
may
ye
always
be

are
my
children
i
love
ye
and
therefore
i
came
to
help
ye
run
home
now
for
your
father
and
mother
who
reared
ye
the
badgers
are
awaiting
your
coming
they
will
not
know
ye
so
ye
must
roll
up
your
bark
moccasins
and
take
along
your
strings
of
together
with
the
rabbits
ye
have
how
can
we
carry
them
asked
they
for
they
are
then
the
turned
about
and
passed
his
hands
gently
over
the
heap
of
dead
rabbits
lift
them
now
said
he
to
the
children
and
when
they
tried
to
lift
them
lo
they
were
as
light
as
dry
so
they
bade
their
father
farewell
and
started
home
when
they
had
gone
a
little
way
they
stopped
to
look
around
but
their
father
was
nowhere
to
be
seen
sure
enough
when
they
neared
home
there
were
the
two
old
badgers
running
around
their
hole
and
the
old
was
just
getting
ready
to
go
out
and
search
for
fear
that
they
had
perished
from
cold
he
had
just
gone
down
to
get
some
and
other
things
with
which
to
wrap
them
when
the
old
woman
who
was
up
above
shouted
down
hurry
come
out
somebody
is
coming
look
said
one
of
the
children
to
the
other
there
s
our
poor
mother
waiting
for
us
hurry
up
let
s
run
or
else
our
father
will
come
out
searching
for
as
they
approached
they
called
out
poor
mother
here
you
are
in
the
cold
waiting
for
but
she
did
not
recognize
them
and
only
hid
her
face
in
her
paws
from
shame
for
they
were
too
beautiful
to
look
upon
just
like
the
don
t
you
know
us
mother
asked
the
two
to
the
old
woman
just
as
the
old
badger
came
out
no
answered
she
why
we
are
your
children
ah
my
children
did
not
look
like
you
we
are
they
look
here
said
they
and
they
showed
the
bark
moccasins
and
the
strings
of
our
poor
children
yes
our
father
is
no
other
than
the
and
he
came
down
to
speak
to
us
today
and
he
dressed
us
as
you
see
just
like
himself
and
he
said
that
our
mother
used
to
live
over
in
the
home
of
the
eagles
that
our
aunts
still
live
there
and
our
grandfather
and
that
our
mother
used
to
live
there
but
the
twain
killed
her
as
she
was
trying
to
escape
on
the
back
of
an
eagle
and
when
she
fell
into
the
cañon
of
the
coyote
we
were
born
and
father
here
found
us
and
you
both
reared
yes
that
is
very
true
said
the
old
badger
i
know
it
all
and
i
know
too
that
there
will
be
a
dance
at
the
home
of
the
eagles
in
eight
days
tomorrow
there
will
be
only
seven
left
and
when
the
eighth
day
comes
you
will
both
go
there
to
see
it
come
up
and
come
down
said
he
so
the
two
entered
but
they
were
ill
at
ease
in
their
clothes
which
they
were
not
used
to
and
when
the
old
mother
had
placed
soft
on
the
floor
they
doffed
their
clothing
and
carefully
laid
it
away
then
the
whole
family
ate
their
evening
meal
keep
count
for
us
father
and
when
the
time
comes
let
us
know
said
the
boys
so
the
days
passed
by
until
the
day
before
the
dance
and
that
morning
the
old
badger
said
to
the
two
tomorrow
the
dance
will
very
well
replied
they
let
us
go
out
and
hunt
today
that
you
and
mother
may
have
something
to
so
they
went
forth
and
in
the
evening
came
back
with
great
numbers
of
rabbits
and
the
old
mother
skinned
the
rabbits
and
put
some
of
them
to
cook
over
night
so
that
her
children
might
eat
before
starting
for
the
town
under
thunder
mountain
at
sunrise
next
morning
both
dressed
themselves
carefully
put
on
their
plumes
and
started
on
the
pathway
that
leads
around
the
mountain
they
passed
the
village
of
k
yátik
ia
on
their
way
and
the
people
marvelled
greatly
at
their
beauty
and
their
magnificent
dress
and
so
they
followed
the
road
through
the
cañon
of
the
coyotes
thence
by
the
crooked
pathway
and
the
covered
road
under
the
house
into
the
court
of
k
iákime
just
as
the
had
told
them
they
found
everything
there
there
was
the
great
house
with
the
tall
ladder
and
the
two
macaws
and
there
were
the
young
maidens
their
aunts
sitting
on
the
and
as
the
dancers
came
into
the
court
they
stepped
forward
and
then
it
was
that
the
people
first
saw
and
hailed
them
the
chief
of
the
dance
came
forward
and
asked
them
whither
they
came
and
if
they
would
not
join
in
the
dance
so
they
assented
and
came
forward
to
the
center
of
the
plaza
and
as
they
began
to
dance
the
young
girls
arose
and
the
dance
chiefs
went
and
escorted
them
to
the
dance
plaza
although
they
told
them
dance
here
they
did
not
obey
they
ran
right
over
to
where
the
two
young
men
were
dancing
and
took
hold
of
their
hands
just
as
the
had
told
them
it
would
come
to
pass
and
in
fact
everything
happened
just
as
he
had
said
yes
they
all
ran
down
and
grasped
the
two
boys
hands
and
when
the
dance
was
over
and
they
let
go
they
said
to
the
two
handsome
young
strangers
come
up
come
it
is
well
said
the
two
young
men
so
they
all
went
up
into
the
house
and
sat
down
now
all
these
girls
were
young
and
they
were
very
much
pleased
with
the
young
men
in
fact
the
two
youngest
were
in
love
with
them
already
so
they
smiled
and
made
themselves
very
pleasant
then
the
first
brother
arose
and
went
over
to
the
eldest
one
and
said
what
is
it
she
replied
for
of
course
throughout
the
cities
of
men
we
as
the
daughters
of
a
great
priest
are
the
mothers
of
children
and
so
on
until
they
came
to
the
last
and
youngest
one
whom
they
called
little
and
she
also
replied
that
however
young
they
might
be
still
they
might
be
counted
the
mothers
of
the
children
of
men
no
verily
ye
are
our
parents
replied
the
twain
beyond
this
room
is
another
and
beyond
that
another
and
beyond
that
yet
another
where
lived
our
mother
who
never
went
forth
from
her
house
but
sat
day
after
day
making
sacred
trays
and
there
even
now
according
to
the
colors
of
the
parts
of
the
world
hang
her
trays
on
the
and
so
as
the
sun
had
told
them
they
finished
their
story
then
the
people
were
convinced
and
sent
for
the
grandfather
the
great
and
when
he
came
they
all
embraced
their
new
children
admiring
greatly
their
straight
smooth
limbs
and
abundant
hair
then
the
grandfather
dressed
them
in
some
of
the
beautiful
ornaments
their
mother
used
to
wear
and
when
evening
approached
they
feasted
them
and
after
the
meal
was
over
as
the
sun
was
setting
the
two
boys
arose
and
said
we
must
stay
with
us
stay
with
us
the
young
girls
and
the
grandfather
said
why
should
you
go
away
from
your
home
this
is
your
own
no
we
said
to
our
mother
and
father
the
badgers
that
we
would
return
to
them
therefore
we
must
go
urged
the
boys
so
at
last
they
consented
and
wished
them
a
happy
journey
fear
not
said
the
two
as
they
started
for
we
shall
yet
go
and
get
our
mother
even
tomorrow
we
shall
go
to
acoma
where
the
people
dance
day
after
day
in
her
then
they
departed
and
returned
to
the
place
of
the
badgers
when
they
arrived
at
home
sure
enough
there
were
their
and
awaiting
them
outside
their
holes
oh

are
they
cried
yes
how
did
you
come
unto
the
evening
happily
replied
the
old
ones
come
in
come
in
so
they
entered
when
they
had
finished
eating
the
elder
brother
said
mother
father

must
go
after
our
mother

the
next
day
quite

with

replied
the
it
is
but
the
said
oh
my
poor
children
my
poor
boys
so
early
next
morning
the
rolled
up
some
sweet
in
a
blanket
for
she
did
not
have
to
string
them
now
and
together
the
twain
started
up
the
eastern
trail
their
father
the
sun
thought
to
help
them
therefore
he
lengthened
the
day
and
took
two
steps
only
at
a
time
until
the
two
boys
had
arrived
at
the
springs
of
the
elks
almost
on
the
borders
of
the
acoma
country
then
with
his
usual
speed
journeyed
the
toward
the
land
of
night
and
the
two
boys
continued
until
they
arrived
within
sight
of
the
town
of
the
acomas
away
out
there
on
top
of
a
mountain
sure
enough
there
was
an
old
hag
struggling
along
under
a
load
of
wood
and
as
the
two
brothers
came
up
to
her
they
said
ha
grandmother
how
are
you
these
many
days
happy
replied
the
old
woman
why
is
it
that
you
a
woman
and
an
old
woman
have
to
carry
wood
why
i
am
the
priestess
of
the
dance
answered
the
old
woman
priestess
of
the
dance
what
dance
why
there
once
lived
a
maiden
in
the
town
of
the
eagles
and
the
two
gods
of
war
shot
her
one
day
from
the
back
of
an
eagle
who
was
trying
to
run
away
with
her
and
she
fell
and
one
of
my
young
men
was
the
first
to
grasp
her
therefore
we
dance
with
her
bones
every
well
why
do
you
get
this
wood
they
asked
i
light
the
ceremonial
chamber
with
what
do
you
do
when
you
get
home
why
the
maidens
of
my
clan
come
and
baptize
me
and
feast
me
then
when
the
evening
comes
i
go
and
light
a
fire
with
this
wood
in
the
chamber
and
wait
until
the
young
men
gather
and
when
everything
is
ready
i
go
to
a
niche
in
the
wall
and
get
the
maiden
s
bones
and
distribute
them
and
when
they
have
finished
the
dance
i
tell
them
to
stop
and
they
replace
the
what
do
they
do
then
asked
the
two
boys
why
some
of
them
go
home
and
some
sleep
right
there
and
i
lie
down
and
sleep
there
is
that
all
inquired
the
two
boys
why
yes
what
more
should
there
be
nothing
more
except
that
i
think
we
had
better
kill
you
thereupon
they
struck
her
to
the
earth
and
killed
her
then
they
skinned
her
like
a
bag
and
the
elder
brother
dressed
the
younger
in
the
skin
as
the
had
directed
and
he
shouldered
the
bundle
of
wood
how
do
i
look
asked
he
just
like
her
for
all
the
world
responded
the
other
all
right
said
he
wait
for
me
go
ahead
said
the
elder
brother
and
away
the
younger
went
he
ran
with
all
his
might
till
he
came
near
to
the
town
and
then
he
began
to
limp
along
and
labor
up
the
pathway
just
as
the
old
woman
was
wont
to
do
so
that
everybody
thought
that
he
was
the
old
woman
indeed
and
sure
enough
it
all
happened
just
as
the
had
said
it
would
when
the
dance
was
over
some
of
the
young
men
went
away
and
others
slept
right
there
there
were
so
many
of
them
though
that
they
almost
covered
the
floor
when
they
all
began
to
snore
the
young
man
arose
threw
off
his
disguise
and
stepped
carefully
between
the
sleepers
till
he
reached
the
niche
in
the
wall
then
he
put
his
mother
s
bones
one
by
one
into
his
blanket
felt
all
around
to
see
that
he
left
nothing
and
started
for
the
ladder
he
reached
it
all
right
and
took
one
two
three
steps
but
when
his
foot
touched
the
fourth
rung
it
creaked
and
the
sleeping
dancers
awoke
and
started
somebody
is
going
up
the
ladder
they
exclaimed
to
one
another
then
the
young
man
ran
up
as
fast
as
ever
he
could
but
alas
he
dropped
one
of
his
mother
s
eyes
out
of
the
blanket
he
kept
on
running
until
he
reached
the
foot
of
the
hill
upon
which
the
town
stood
and
when
he
came
to
the
spring
down
on
the
plains
he
stopped
to
drink
and
lo
his
mother
had
come
to
life
uttered
the
mother
i
m
tired
and
i
don
t
know
what
is
the
matter
with
my
eyes
for
things
don
t
look
then
the
young
man
looked
at
his
mother
she
was
more
beautiful
than
all
the
other
girls
had
been
but
one
of
her
eyes
was
shrunken
in
alas
my
mother
said
he
i
have
dropped
one
of
your
eyes
but
never
mind
you
can
comb
your
hair
down
over
it
and
no
one
will
ever
know
the
as
soon
as
they
were
rested
they
started
again
and
soon
came
to
where
the
elder
brother
stood
awaiting
them
when
he
looked
at
his
mother
he
saw
that
one
of
her
eyes
had
been
left
didn
t
i
tell
you
beforehand
to
be
careful
said
he
poor
mother
you
have
lost
one
of
her
eyes
well
it
can
t
be
helped
never
mind
she
can
comb
her
hair
down
over
the
eye
that
is
dry
and
no
one
will
ever
know
the
that
s
so
it
can
t
be
helped
now
let
s
go
said
the
elder
brother
and
they
all
started
when
they
arrived
at
the
waters
of
the
elks
the
younger
brother
said
let
s
camp
no
let
s
run
home
returned
the
elder
brother
no
let
s
camp
our
poor
mother
will
get
tired
and
besides
she
can
see
nothing
of
the
country
we
are
going
and
although
the
elder
brother
urged
that
they
should
go
on
the
younger
insisted
that
they
should
stay
therefore
they
camped
the
next
day
they
continued
their
journey
until
they
came
near
to
the
city
of
the
heights
not
far
from
their
own
home
and
as
they
journeyed
the
deer
the
antelope
the
elks
and
the
mountain
sheep
were
everywhere
just
look
at
that
buck
exclaimed
the
younger
brother
clutching
his
bow
let
s
shoot
no
no
said
the
other
do
you
not
remember
that
our
father
forbade
us
so
they
went
on
until
they
came
to
some
trees
and
as
it
was
they
sat
down
to
eat
now
the
fine
game
animals
circled
all
around
and
even
came
up
near
enough
to
smell
them
and
stood
gazing
or
cropping
the
grass
within
a
few
steps
of
them
just
look
at
that
splendid
antelope
cried
the
younger
brother
and
he
nocked
an
arrow
quicker
than
thought
no
no
no
cried
the
elder
you
must
not
shoot
why
not
here
our
poor
mother
has
nothing
but
to
eat
with
all
this
meat
around
and
before
his
brother
could
speak
another
word
he
drew
his
arrow
to
the
head
and
it
pierced
the
heart
of
the
great
antelope
and
it
fell
dead
now
all
the
great
animals
round
about
grew
angry
when
they
saw
this
and
they
came
thundering
after
the
little
party
so
the
two
fools
forgetting
all
about
their
poor
mother
jumped
up
and
ran
away
as
fast
as
they
could
and
climbed
a
big
tree
to
the
very
top
when
they
straddled
a
big
branch
and
looked
down
the
great
deer
had
trampled
their
poor
mother
to
death
then
they
gathered
around
the
foot
of
the
tree
to
batter
its
trunk
with
their
sharp
horns
but
they
could
not
stir
it
presently
some
bucks
came
running
along
they
banged
their
horns
against
the
butt
of
the
tree
until
it
began
to
split
and
tremble
and
presently
bang
went
the
tree
and
the
boys
fell
to
the
ground
then
the
mountain
sheep
and
the
great
bucks
trampled
and
tore
and
speared
them
with
their
sharp
horns
and
tossed
them
from
one
to
another
and
lacerated
them
with
their
hoofs
until
they
were
like
clothing
all
torn
to
pieces
except
the
head
of
the
elder
brother
which
none
of
them
would
touch
and
there
the
head
lay
all
through
the
winter
and
the
next
spring
there
was
nothing
but
a
skull
left
of
the
two
brothers
now
off
in
the
valley
that
led
to
thunder
mountain
just
where
it
turns
to
go
south
stood
the
village
of
k
yátik
ia
and
down
in
the
bottom
of
the
valley
the
great
of
k
yátik
ia
had
his
fields
of
corn
and
melons
and
squashes
summer
came
and
the
squashes
were
all
in
bloom
when
the
rain
poured
down
all
over
the
country
and
thus
little
by
little
the
skull
was
washed
until
it
fell
into
a
stream
and
went
bumping
along
on
the
waters
even
till
it
came
to
the
fields
of
corn
and
pumpkins
and
melons
in
the
planting
of
the
of
k
yátik
ia
now
when
the
pumpkin
and
squash
vines
were
in
bloom
the
s
daughter
who
was
as
beautiful
as
you
could
look
upon
went
down
every
morning
just
at
daylight
to
gather
with
which
to
sweeten
the
feast
bread
the
morning
after
the
rain
had
passed
over
very
early
she
said
to
her
younger
sister
stay
here
and
grind
meal
while
i
run
down
to
the
squash
patch
to
pick
a
lot
of
so
she
took
her
mantle
with
her
and
started
for
the
fields
she
had
not
been
picking
flowers
long
when
a
voice
rose
from
the
middle
of
the
vines
here
are
more
flowers
here
are
more
flowers
beautiful
ones
ah
said
the
girl
i
wonder
what
that
is
so
she
put
her
blanket
of
flowers
down
as
soon
as
possible
and
started
to
hunt
as
she
approached
the
vine
where
the
skull
had
been
wont
to
lie
lo
there
was
a
handsome
young
man
what
are
you
doing
asked
the
young
man
gathering
flowers
said
she
if
you
will
promise
to
take
me
home
with
you
i
will
help
you
said
the
young
man
very
well
replied
the
girl
will
you
surely
do
it
inquired
the
young
man
yes
said
she
and
lo
the
young
man
reached
out
his
hand
and
there
was
a
great
heap
of
flowers
already
plucked
before
him
and
while
they
were
yet
talking
the
sun
rose
and
as
its
first
rays
touched
him
he
began
to
sink
until
there
before
the
girl
was
nothing
but
a
hideous
old
skull
oh
dear
cried
she
but
i
promised
to
take
it
and
i
suppose
i
so
she
took
the
skull
up
with
the
tips
of
her
fingers
and
put
it
into
the
blanket
among
the
flowers
and
started
for
home
then
she
entered
an
inner
room
of
the
house
and
taking
the
skull
carefully
out
of
the
blanket
placed
some
cotton
in
a
large
new
and
laid
the
skull
upon
it
then
she
covered
the
jar
with
a
flat
stone
and
went
to
work
grinding
meal
when
the
sun
was
setting
a
voice
came
from
the
jar
take
me
down
quick
and
the
girl
took
the
skull
down
and
placed
it
on
the
floor
and
as
it
grew
dark
there
stood
the
same
handsome
young
man
as
before
magnificently
clothed
with
precious
stones
and
shells
all
about
him
just
as
the
had
dressed
him
and
the
girl
was
very
happy
and
told
him
she
would
marry
him
next
morning
just
as
the
sun
rose
the
young
man
vanished
and
nothing
but
the
old
white
skull
lay
on
the
floor
so
the
girl
placed
it
in
the
jar
again
and
taking
up
another
went
out
toward
the
spring
now
her
younger
sister
went
into
the
room
and
espied
the
jar
i
wonder
what
sister
has
covered
this
jar
up
so
carefully
for
said
she
to
herself
and
she
stepped
up
to
the
jar
and
took
the
lid
off
cried
she
o
dear
o
dear
she
screamed
for
when
she
looked
down
into
the
jar
there
was
a
great
rattlesnake
coiled
up
over
the
smooth
white
skull
so
she
ran
and
called
her
father
and
told
him
in
great
fright
what
she
had
seen
ah
said
the
father
for
he
was
a
very
wise
thou
shouldst
not
meddle
with
things
thou
shouldst
keep
quiet
said
he
he
then
arose
and
went
into
the
room
then
he
approached
the
jar
and
looking
down
into
it
said
have
mercy
upon
us
my
child
my
father
become
as
thou
art
disguise
not
thyself
in
hideous
forms
but
as
thou
hast
been
be
and
the
skull
rattled
against
the
sides
of
the
jar
in
assent
it
is
well
that
thou
shouldst
marry
my
daughter
and
we
will
close
this
room
that
thou
shalt
never
come
forth
and
again
the
skull
clattered
and
nodded
in
glad
assent
so
when
the
young
girl
returned
the
voice
came
forth
from
the
jar
again
and
said
close
all
the
windows
and
doors
and
bring
me
raw
cotton
if
thy
father
have
it
for
he
has
consented
that
i
marry
you
and
throw
off
my
then
the
girl
gladly
assented
and
ran
to
get
the
cotton
and
brought
a
great
quantity
in
the
room
then
when
the
night
came
the
voice
called
once
more
take
me
down
the
girl
did
as
she
was
bidden
and
the
young
man
again
stood
before
her
more
handsome
than
ever
so
he
married
the
girl
and
both
were
very
happy
and
the
next
morning
when
the
sun
rose
the
young
man
did
not
again
change
his
form
but
remained
as
he
was
and
began
to
spin
cotton
marvellously
fine
and
to
weave
blankets
and
mantles
of
the
most
beautiful
texture
for
in
nothing
could
he
fail
being
a
child
of
the
and
a
god
himself
so
the
days
and
weeks
passed
by
and
the
looked
down
through
the
windows
in
sorrow
and
said
alas
my
son
i
have
delivered
thee
and
yet
thou
comest
not
to
speak
with
thy
father
but
thou
shalt
yet
come
yea
verily
thou
shalt
yet
so
in
time
the
beautiful
daughter
of
the
gave
birth
to
two
boys
like
the
children
of
the
deer
as
day
succeeded
day
they
grew
larger
and
wiser
and
their
limbs
strengthened
until
they
could
run
about
and
thus
it
happened
that
one
day
in
their
play
they
climbed
up
and
played
upon
the
and
on
the
ground
below
thus
it
was
that
the
people
of
k
yátik
ia
saw
for
the
first
time
the
two
little
children
and
when
they
saw
them
they
wondered
greatly
of
course
they
wondered
greatly
our
grandfathers
were
fools
who
in
the
world
has
married
the
s
daughter
everybody
asked
of
one
another
nobody
knew
so
they
called
a
council
and
made
all
the
young
men
go
to
it
and
they
asked
each
one
if
he
had
secretly
married
the
s
daughter
and
every
one
of
them
said
no
and
looked
at
every
other
one
in
great
wonder
who
in
the
world
can
it
be
it
may
be
that
some
stranger
has
come
and
married
her
and
it
may
be
that
he
stays
so
the
council
decided
that
it
would
be
well
for
him
and
the
girl
and
their
two
little
ones
to
die
because
they
had
deceived
their
people
forthwith
two
mounted
the
and
commanded
the
people
to
make
haste
and
to
prepare
their
weapons
straighten
your
arrows
strengthen
the
backs
of
your
bows
put
new
points
on
your
lances
harden
your
shields
and
get
ready
for
battle
for
in
four
days
the
daughter
and
grandchildren
of
the
and
the
unknown
husband
must
die
and
when
the
s
daughter
heard
the
voices
of
the
heralds
she
asked
her
younger
sister
who
had
been
listening
what
they
said
and
the
younger
sister
exclaimed
alas
you
must
all
die
and
then
she
told
her
what
she
had
heard
now
the
young
man
called
the
old
priest
and
told
him
that
he
knew
what
would
happen
and
the
old
priest
said
it
is
well
let
the
will
of
the
gods
be
done
my
people
know
not
the
way
of
good
fortune
but
are
fools
and
must
have
their
therefore
for
two
days
the
people
labored
at
their
weapons
and
on
the
morning
of
the
third
day
they
began
to
prepare
for
a
feast
of
victory
then
said
the
young
man
to
his
wife
my
little
mother
dearly
beloved
on
the
morrow
i
must
go
forth
to
meet
my
father
for
he
suddenly
remembered
that
he
had
neglected
his
father
when
the
sun
had
nearly
reached
the
the
young
man
said
to
his
wife
go
up
and
open
the
farewell
said
he
and
he
suddenly
became
a
cloud
of
mist
which
whirled
round
and
round
and
shot
up
like
a
whirlwind
in
the
rays
of
sunlight
when
he
neared
the
sun
the
said
nothing
and
the
young
man
waited
outside
in
shame
then
said
the
in
pretended
anger
come
hither
and
sit
down
thou
hast
been
a
fool
did
i
not
command
thee
and
thy
brother
and
the
young
man
only
bent
his
head
and
said
it
is
too
then
the
smiled
gently
and
said
think
not
neither
be
sad
my
child
i
know
wherefore
thou
comest
and
i
remember
how
thou
didst
try
to
prevail
upon
thy
younger
brother
to
obey
my
commandments
and
that
it
might
be
well
i
caused
thee
to
forget
me
and
to
come
unto
the
past
that
thou
hast
come
unto
thou
shalt
be
a
god
and
shalt
sit
at
my
left
hand
forever
and
ever
shalt
thou
be
a
living
good
unto
men
who
will
see
thee
and
worship
thee
in
the
evening
and
through
thy
will
shall
rain
fall
upon
their
lands
true
i
had
designed
had
my
children
been
wiser
that
thou
shouldst
remain
with
them
and
enrich
them
with
thy
precious
shells
and
stones
with
thy
great
knowledge
and
good
fortune
but
those
are
men
very
unwise
and
ungrateful
therefore
shalt
thou
and
thy
children
and
even
thy
wife
be
won
from
thy
and
sit
by
my
left
hand
descend
make
four
sacred
hoops
and
entwine
them
with
cotton
make
four
sacred
wands
such
as
are
used
in
the
races
hast
thou
an
unembroidered
cotton
mantle
i
have
replied
the
young
man
it
is
well
this
evening
spread
it
out
and
place
at
each
of
its
four
corners
one
of
the
sacred
hoops
and
wands
place
all
thereon
that
thou
valuest
leave
not
a
precious
stone
nor
yet
a
shell
to
serve
as
parentage
for
others
but
place
all
thereon
the
people
will
gather
around
thy
father
s
house
and
storm
it
and
then
retire
and
storm
it
again
now
when
the
people
approach
the
house
sit
ye
down
one
at
each
of
the
four
corners
grasp
them
and
lift
them
upward
and
gradually
ye
will
be
raised
then
when
the
people
approach
nearer
lift
them
upward
once
more
and
ye
will
be
raised
yet
farther
and
when
they
begin
to
mount
the
ladders
lift
ye
again
and
yet
again
and
ye
shall
come
unto
my
so
the
young
man
descended
no
change
was
visible
in
the
old
s
countenance
he
had
caused
gay
preparations
to
go
forward
for
the
festival
for
a
priest
knows
that
all
things
are
well
and
he
makes
no
change
in
his
mind
or
actions
and
when
he
asked
the
young
man
what
the
had
said
to
him
the
only
reply
was
it
shall
be
well
tomorrow
we
go
to
dwell
forever
at
the
home
of
the
early
in
the
morning
the
two
priests
of
war
mounted
to
the
and
called
out
hasten
hasten
for
the
time
has
come
and
the
people
must
gather
each
carrying
his
weapons
for
today
the
children
of
our
must
die
so
after
the
morning
meal
all
gathered
at
the
council
chambers
of
the
warriors
and
a
great
company
they
were
the
sun
had
risen
high
brightly
painted
shields
glittered
in
his
light
long
lances
stood
black
with
paint
like
the
charred
trunks
of
a
burned
forest
and
the
people
raised
their
and
struck
them
against
one
another
until
the
din
was
like
thunder
sounded
the
clash
of
weapons
and
the
of
the
people
and
in
the
home
of
the
they
knew
they
were
coming
all
night
long
they
had
been
preparing
the
young
man
had
placed
all
their
belongings
upon
the
blanket
and
now
one
by
one
they
sat
down
the
wife
and
the
husband
grasped
two
corners
the
children
grasping
the
two
others
they
lifted
them
and
slowly
arose
toward
the
ceiling
once
more
as
the
people
came
nearer
they
lifted
the
corners
and
neared
the
when
again
they
lifted
the
corners
they
passed
above
the
roof
and
the
people
saw
their
shadows
cast
upon
the
ground
quick
quick
shouted
the
young
men
see
the
shadow
they
are
escaping
already
the
arrows
began
to
whistle
past
them
but
the
sun
cast
his
shield
beneath
them
and
the
arrows
only
glanced
away
or
flew
past
once
more
they
drew
the
corners
of
the
mantle
upward
and
as
they
rose
higher
and
higher
the
people
old
and
young
began
to
quarrel
and
fell
to
beating
one
another
and
to
fighting
among
themselves
the
old
ones
called
the
young
ones
fools
for
attempting
the
life
of
a
god
and
the
young
ones
in
turn
called
the
old
ones
fools
for
counselling
them
to
attempt
the
life
of
a
god
thus
shall
ye
ever
be
cried
the
young
man
for
ye
are
fools
your
father
the
sun
had
intended
all
things
for
your
good
but
ye
were
fools
therefore
with
me
and
mine
will
pass
away
your
peace
and
your
my
children
at
sunset
have
you
not
seen
the
little
blue
twinkling
stars
that
sit
at
the
left
hand
of
the
sun
as
he
sinks
into
night
thus
did
it
come
to
pass
in
the
days
of
the
ancients
and
thus
it
is
that
only
in
the
east
and
the
west
where
the
sun
rises
and
sets
even
on
the
borders
of
the
great
oceans
may
we
find
the
jewels
whereby
we
decorate
our
persons
and
ever
since
then
my
children
the
world
has
been
filled
with
anger
and
even
brothers
agree
then
disagree
strike
one
another
and
spill
their
own
blood
in
foolish
anger
perhaps
had
men
been
more
grateful
and
wiser
the
had
smiled
and
dropped
everywhere
the
treasures
we
long
for
and
not
hidden
them
deep
in
the
earth
and
buried
them
in
the
shores
of
the
sea
and
perhaps
moreover
all
men
would
have
smiled
upon
one
another
and
never
enlarged
their
voices
nor
strengthened
their
arms
in
anger
toward
one
another
thus
short
is
my
story
and
may
the
grow
as
long
as
my
stretches
and
may
the
will
of
the
holder
of
the
roads
of
life
shelter
me
from
dangers
as
he
sheltered
his
children
in
the
days
of
the
ancients
with
the
shield
of
his
sunlight
