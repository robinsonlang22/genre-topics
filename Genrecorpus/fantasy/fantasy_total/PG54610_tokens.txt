preface
with
the
drawings
it
began
an
expired
world
tried
to
come
to
life
again
in
the
fragments
which
some
old
maori
narrated
nature
all
around
favoured
admiration
only
and
her
loneliness
was
alive
with
longing
of
maori
art
i
had
never
heard
and
when
that
art
was
first
offered
to
me
i
had
none
other
to
choose
at
first
it
disgusted
me
but
i
had
to
make
use
of
my
time
the
evergreen
nature
was
beautiful
and
entrancing
was
her
invitation
to
waste
my
life
in
her
midst
as
she
herself
was
wasting
hers
to
protect
myself
against
her
allurements
i
began
the
first
sketches
of
old
carvings
then
i
made
more
sitting
beside
me
and
looking
at
my
work
an
old
maori
related
the
deeds
of
his
ancestor
upon
whose
carved
image
i
was
at
work
and
they
were
mighty
deeds
in
the
evenings
later
at
the
those
deeds
lived
again
in
my
thoughts
and
the
imagination
busied
herself
awkwardly
enough
to
express
new
ideas
with
the
help
of
new
forms
that
was
the
beginning
of
the
first
drawing
out
of
books
i
could
learn
the
old
legends
but
from
the
fragmentary
narratives
of
my
old
friends
they
sprang
into
life
so
the
number
of
drawings
grew
aimless
purposeless
by
that
which
first
had
disgusted
me
i
was
now
greatly
attracted
the
forest
was
dreaming
while
i
worked
the
river
murmured
and
a
strange
people
awoke
interest
and
friendship
then
one
day
came
a
traveller
from
europe
he
saw
the
drawings
and
spoke
the
words
make
a
book
and
the
magic
words
i
ll
get
it
published
then
he
went
his
way
back
to
europe
again
it
was
four
years
ago
because
these
words
were
spoken
in
a
country
this
book
came
to
life
otherwise
the
destiny
of
those
first
few
drawings
would
doubtless
have
been
the
destiny
of
everything
else
in
the
great
nature
to
wither
to
fall
to
dust
perhaps
it
would
have
been
a
pity
as
to
the
text
of
the
book
twere
better
that
another
had
written
it
more
serious
treatises
have
been
published
by
those
with
greater
opportunities
to
hear
and
more
art
to
reproduce
the
legends
from
the
mouths
of
the
old
folk
now
dead
and
gone
and
i
owe
a
good
deal
to
them
especially
to
sir
george
grey
s
and
rev
taylor
s
ika
a
as
well
as
to
mr
john
white
mr
schirren
and
hamilton
s
but
it
was
to
my
old
friends
that
i
chiefly
listened
seeking
to
look
into
the
past
through
their
eyes
to
stir
my
imagination
through
their
memories
yet
even
though
my
pencil
may
not
have
done
its
work
amiss
i
have
grave
doubts
of
the
work
of
my
pen
a
part
only
of
the
legends
is
contained
in
this
book
it
will
suffice
to
keep
alive
what
i
have
received
from
my
tattooed
friends
during
the
long
long
days
of
a
peculiarly
strange
life
the
little
that
is
new
in
my
book
does
not
pretend
to
be
scientific
i
have
written
it
to
help
my
drawings
along
their
way
and
after
all
the
book
would
possibly
never
have
been
completed
without
the
friends
which
the
drawings
made
in
new
zealand
above
all
augustus
hamilton
director
of
the
colonial
museum
the
encouragement
and
help
i
received
from
him
the
benefit
of
his
wide
knowledge
and
love
of
art
and
of
all
things
maori
and
his
true
friendship
gave
confidence
to
my
wavering
hopes
of
representing
graphically
the
imaginings
of
a
people
so
alien
to
and
so
distant
from
the
european
mind
at
last
everything
was
done
the
parting
hour
came
from
the
new
home
back
to
the
old
and
now
my
thoughts
are
wandering
back
often
and
often
to
that
distant
time
when
everything
was
at
its
beginning
when
the
tent
was
pitched
under
the
willow
on
the
river
and
from
the
maori
village
on
the
other
shore
issued
the
sounds
of
happy
life
when
morning
after
morning
the
sun
rose
golden
over
the
hills
and
every
night
the
river
reflected
the
silvery
stars
when
the
willow
grew
slowly
yellow
and
the
falling
leaves
gilded
the
tent
when
the
smoke
of
the
rose
blue
into
the
skies
and
the
first
drawing
was
finished
dittmer
introduction
illustration
and
a
small
fire
had
been
kindled
and
over
it
hummed
the
billy
boiling
for
the
last
time
in
maoriland
through
the
misty
atmosphere
the
sun
was
sinking
powerless
and
glowing
red
and
night
came
a
grand
night
beautifully
illuminated
grand
clouds
of
smoke
ascended
from
the
burning
primeval
forest
a
first
mighty
sign
of
the
work
of
man
and
the
will
of
man
for
the
fire
has
to
finish
the
work
of
the
axe
and
to
consume
the
forest
stars
in
silvery
brilliance
bespatter
the
east
the
west
is
all
aglow
with
crimson
gold
and
creamy
white
but
work
and
care
will
follow
the
great
destruction
for
endless
is
the
beauty
of
this
ever
green
country
but
its
liberty
and
its
fruitfulness
are
labour
he
who
wishes
for
liberty
must
till
the
soil
and
the
fruit
of
liberty
shall
be
art
for
art
is
not
an
image
but
a
fruit
a
strange
fruit
is
once
gathered
by
the
maori
children
of
nature
a
fruit
grown
out
of
the
darknesses
of
the
forests
an
art
hopeless
and
sad
a
fruit
without
seed
was
not
darkness
the
mother
of
all
does
not
the
everlasting
ocean
encircle
all
and
in
the
end
must
not
darkness
again
swallow
all
this
art
followed
the
ways
of
untiring
nature
unseeming
tools
unmeasured
time
and
endless
labour
shaped
to
perfection
the
hardest
stone
into
the
mere
pounamu
the
beautifully
formed
and
polished
the
giant
of
the
forest
into
the
wonderful
stones
and
shells
have
to
shape
the
tree
into
the
of
the
house
into
the
mighty
figure
of
the
god
and
ancestor
and
such
labour
stands
in
grim
need
of
incantations
to
the
atuas
gods
who
dwell
in
the
darknesses
of
the
lower
world
and
who
dwell
in
the
spaces
of
light
above
the
earth
that
they
may
strengthen
and
enliven
the
unseeming
tools
with
their
the
sages
and
dreamers
of
many
generations
had
spent
their
lives
bending
over
the
smoke
of
their
little
fires
and
forming
into
wisdom
what
their
eyes
perceived
of
the
wonders
of
the
world
and
their
wisdom
has
resulted
in
incantations
and
karakias
powerful
enough
to
overcome
the
gods
these
incantations
and
karakias
are
tapu
that
is
sacred
the
possessor
of
them
is
a
tohunga
a
tohunga
is
sacred
the
tapu
of
the
tohunga
is
descended
from
the
gods
and
so
is
his
wisdom
the
gods
are
all
descended
from
the
great
mother
darkness
the
goddess
and
they
are
the
ancestors
of
mankind
which
with
every
generation
moves
farther
and
farther
away
from
the
gods
once
a
great
inspiration
must
have
fallen
upon
the
maori
world
but
since
then
generation
followed
generation
framing
incantations
speculating
shaping
never
renewing
never
widening
this
inspiration
but
working
out
form
and
expression
to
perfection
the
life
of
man
became
like
the
life
of
nature
producing
and
again
destroying
giving
birth
and
again
killing
to
enable
life
to
be
sustained
the
souls
of
man
grew
into
the
rigid
wisdom
of
incantations
the
food
of
man
became
man
he
who
wishes
for
art
must
till
the
soil
but
he
who
tills
the
soil
must
have
faith
for
art
though
a
fruit
of
nature
is
a
child
of
god
with
the
rising
sun
came
the
old
friend
and
placed
fresh
wood
on
the
a
work
of
love
for
he
is
a
chief
priest
of
great
mana
in
his
tribe
and
his
tapu
forbids
menial
labour
with
sorrow
in
his
face
he
sat
down
quietly
laying
a
parting
present
at
our
feet
on
the
water
of
the
river
sways
the
reflected
canoe
loaded
for
the
journey
and
the
sun
plays
among
the
leaves
of
the
trees
the
children
of
the
god
take
with
you
the
wisdom
of
the
old
people
my
wanderer
the
wisdom
which
will
be
soon
forgotten
among
my
children
who
follow
now
the
ways
of
the
pakeha
the
new
friends
who
came
to
us
bringing
the
truth
of
their
god
and
we
are
now
all
children
of
the
great
queen
over
the
seas
who
promised
to
be
our
mother
go
in
peace
my
friend
deeply
thinking
he
looked
in
the
glowing
embers
each
followed
his
own
thoughts
far
away
at
hawaiki
was
the
world
created
and
there
is
the
home
of
the
maoris
it
is
the
birthplace
of
their
race
it
was
the
of
their
ancestors
who
are
gods
now
and
live
in
the
heavens
it
is
their
spirit
land
their
ancestors
built
the
the
sacred
temple
at
hawaiki
and
it
stood
facing
the
east
at
the
place
of
mua
in
the
assembled
the
highest
chiefs
and
the
tohungas
of
all
the
tribes
to
communicate
with
the
spirits
of
the
gods
and
to
repeat
and
rehearse
the
names
and
heroic
deeds
of
their
ancestors
that
they
might
take
deep
root
in
the
hearts
of
the
living
and
that
they
might
never
forget
their
descent
from
the
most
ancient
gods
who
dwelled
in
the
darkness
the
nothing
and
the
beginning
of
all
things
they
assembled
to
acquire
and
repeat
the
sacred
wisdom
of
the
incantations
the
ceremonies
and
the
traditions
from
the
nothing
to
the
lower
world
to
the
light
to
the
great
heaven
and
to
the
great
earth
the
incantations
and
karakias
to
the
gods
of
war
and
of
witchcraft
and
the
food
and
all
those
to
the
multitude
of
spirits
who
govern
help
or
hinder
the
living
from
hawaiki
the
heroes
and
their
tribes
wandered
over
the
seas
and
the
tohungas
took
with
them
the
wisdom
of
the
guarding
it
sacredly
and
repeating
it
only
to
the
ears
of
their
descendants
or
to
those
of
high
rank
and
ambition
and
nothing
of
the
sacred
knowledge
was
lost
from
the
days
of
to
the
present
time
but
now
it
is
dying
with
the
last
tohungas
little
only
is
known
of
the
sacred
wisdom
of
the
maoris
the
dread
of
the
old
gods
is
still
living
in
the
hearts
of
the
maoris
but
the
last
hour
has
come
for
them
as
they
now
bend
their
tattoed
heads
over
the
fire
and
murmur
regretfully
of
the
great
past
thoughtfully
looked
the
old
friend
at
me
and
i
spoke
farewell
friend
wide
you
opened
your
heart
and
far
away
will
i
take
your
love
with
me
far
away
into
the
great
distance
to
my
hawaiki
and
always
will
i
think
of
the
tohunga
of
the
maoris
the

my
friend
small
was
my
little

bad
were
my

i
was

the
incantations
to
the
atuas

have

have

commenced
his

wandering
to
find
adornment
for
his

the

whom
he
beheld
standing
high
over
papa
naked
by
day
and
lonely
and
cold
by
night
and
he
spoke
o
father
rangi
my
heart
is
looking
upon
you
in
sorrow
for
you
are
lonely
and
cold
and
i
will
go
in
quest
for
adornments
which
shall
make
you
beautiful
to
the
eyes
of
papa
and
her
thereupon
he
went
on
his
way
and
whilst
he
was
wandering
through
the
ten
heavens
he
found
the
red
colour
and
that
he
took
back
with
him
upon
the
earth
here
he
rested
for
seven
days
and
seven
nights
and
when
his
strength
was
growing
again
he
commenced
his
work
and
covered
the
heaven
with
the
beautiful
red
colour
but
behold
when
he
had
finished
this
great
work
and
descended
again
to
earth
he
let
his
eyes
wander
over
the
red
sky
which
was
stretching
now
over
papa
and
he
found
that
this
adornment
was
not
worthy
of
his
great
father
and
full
of
sorrow
he
took
it
away
again
leaving
some
of
it
only
at
the
end
of
heaven
he
beheld
now
when
rangi
was
closing
his
great
eye
sending
it
down
into
the
po
or
when
he
called
for
it
again
in
the
mornings
so
that
it
burst
forth
out
of
the
gate
of
day
that
the
beauty
of
his
father
at
was
wonderful
but
ever
and
ever
it
disappeared
by
day
and
by
night
seven
days

seven
nights
he
was
watching
the
dying
away
and
bursting
forth
again
of
rangi
s
beauty
and
then
out
of
his
sorrow
he
sang
these
words
up
to
his
father
oh
rangi
still
you
are
cold
and
dark
and
lonely
from
the
first
night
to
the
second
night
to
the
tenth
night
when
your
daughter
ascends
again
out
of
the
source
of
living
water
so
that
you
look
down
upon

sorrowful
what
adornment
can
i
find
for
you
that
you
may
be
happy

gladden
the
heart
of
papa
your
loved
one
after
he
had
spoken
these
words
he
wandered
forth
again
upon
his
mighty
search
and
all
over
the
world
he
wandered
and
farther
and
farther
still
he
wandered
till
he
came
to
the
great
distance
and
farther
still
till
at
last
he
came
to
the
lower
world
here
he
found
the
daughter
of
the
light
she
is
the
guardian
of
the
gates
of
the
lower
world
and
tired
from
his
long
journey
he
slept
in
her
house
in
the
darkness
of
night
he
beheld
two
beautiful
stars
shining
forth
they
were
the
children
of
ira
and
their
names
were
lonely
south
and
shore
of
heaven
the
morning
star
and
his
heart
was
glad
over
their
beauty
so
that
his
eyes
could
not
sleep
and
could
not
but
rest
upon
them
all
the
night
in
the
morning
he
called
and
showed
her
the
two
beautiful
stars
shimmering
forth
out
of
the
darkness
of
the
po
and
asked
for
them
for
nothing
could
be
more
beautiful
he
thought
as
an
adornment
for
his
father
rangi
answered
go
son
and
take
the
stars
and
again
he
pleaded
oh
hine
daughter

the
road

may
go

answered
o

is
the
guardian
over

standing
at
there

for
the
two
stars

go
and
take
the

had
rested
and
for
seven
days
and
seven
nights
strengthened
himself
through

when

pictured

the
nakedness

asked
him
to
give
the
beautiful
stars
to

and
tupu
answered
oh
tane
son
of

he
gave
him
the
four
sacred
holders
of
the
world
the
stars
of
the
four
points
of
the
compass
and
then
he
gave
him
the
five

and
all
these

took
away
with
him
and
fastened
the
four
sacred

formed
a

distributed
them
over

from
the
summit
of
the

whilst
still
the
sun
was
standing
high
in

and
again
sorrow
filled
his
heart
when
his
eyes
looked
upon
his
work
for
again
he
found
that
the
adornment
was
not
worthy
of
his
father
rangi
but
at

he
had
finished
his
labour
and
that
was
about
the
time
when
the
sun
was
again
entering
the

resting
upon

watched
the
beautiful
sacred

when
with
the
departing

again
filled
the

wandering

perceived
how

was
stretching
over

was
full

he
sang
o

divided
from

and
so
divided
from
the
first
is
the
second
heaven
which
forms
the
path
for
the
sun
and
the

which
is
the

the
heat
of

the
third
heaven

the

for
the
lakes

the
waters
the
god
of
winds
is
often
rushing
over
them
from
one
end
of
the
heavens
to
the
other
and
that
makes
the
waters
spray
and
splash
and
causes
them
to
fall
as

down
upon

the
governing
god
from

that
he
inspires
the

with
great
deeds
that
the
spirits
of
the
slain
braves
may
live
here
as
stars
on

the
god
of

the
fourth
heaven
is

from

thy
dark
clouds
of
the
spirits
of
the
men
are
roused
and
the
roaring
rush
of
the
rapid
becomes
harmless
under
the
steady
living
power
of
the
paddles
and
the
mighty
pulling
of
the
bending
and
trembling
tokos
into
the
silent
reflecting
calmness
of
the
higher
the
canoe
suddenly
shoots
ngawai
sitting
in
the
prow
folds
her
arms
over
her
paddle
and
looks
listlessly
in
the
trembling
and
rushing
waters
and
smiles
now
the
beautiful
calm
of
the
silent
reach
is
gained
and
the
voice
of
honewaka
is
low
mingling
with
the
distant
rolling
of
the
rapid
as
he
narrates
the
story
of
the
taniwha
who
lives
in
the
caves
of
the
rapid
and
who
has
swallowed
many
a
brave
when
his
song
was
not
powerful
enough
or
was
displeasing
to
the
taniwha
then
she
broke
the
canoes
on
the
large
stones
and
took
the
strong
men
and
beautiful
women
into
her
dark
cave
for
food
disdainfully
looks
ngawai
back
for
now
the
battle
is
won
and
women
despise
the
conquered
foe
be
it
man
or
spirit
great
is
the
power
of
the
spirits
who
live
in
the
image
of
a
beautiful
woman
greater
is
the
power
of
the
spirits
awakened
by
incantations
to
the
gods
and
the
power
of
man
lies
in
the
incantations
which
capture
the
gods
into
their
weapon
but
twice
powerful
is
such
a
weapon
when
used
in
the
service
of
a
beautiful
woman
the
distant
rolling
of
the
rapid
now
sounds
like
happy
laughter
of
beautiful
women
far
away
over
the
water
me
o
tatou
mate
comes
in
the
evening
the
wailing
welcome
from
the
maori
pa
on
the
cliffs
long
is
it
friend
since
a
man
of
your
colour
came
to
me
a
great
white
priest
and
he
took
great
pains
to
teach
me
the
words
of
his
truth
the
words
of
his
god
i
was
young
then
and
takakopiri
who
was
then
so
old
that
he
could
remember
te
the
large
growing
still
as
a
tree
in
the
forest
had
given
to
me
the
wisdom
of
the
ancient
it
was
given
to
him
by
his
grandfather
the
tohunga
rangi
whose
mana
was
so
great
that
people
saluting
him
rubbed
noses
only
against
his
knee
he
was
a
great
rangatira
long
and
marked
with
many
teeth
was
the
the
board
recording
the
ancestors
of
rangi
leading
back
from
ancestor
to
ancestor
to
maui
who
came
from
hawaiki
and
who
is
the
father
of
this
land
which
is
called

leading
still
further
up
to
the
gods
the
wisdom
my
listener

born
at
hawaiki
many
a
time
died

moon
my
friend
and
was
born
again
out
of
the
living
fountain
of
tane
mahuta
while
i
was
asking
the
words
of
the
book
yes
beautiful
is
the
truth
but
endless
to
count
since
then
are
the
floods
who
came
down
the
river
when
his
great
father
the
mountain
ruapehu
shook
off
his
white
garment
of
snow
and
my
flesh
has
dried
to
the
bones
yes
friend
i
loved
the
truth
of
the
white
tohunga
but
she
was
not
like
a
woman
to
me
she
gave
me
no
offspring
ah
the
multitude
of
voices
of
the
past
are
in
my
heart
and
my
hands
can
touch
the
spirits
of
my
ancestors
as
they
can
touch
my
and
they
come
and
feed
me
with
joy
like
children
feed
the
aged
and
my
heart
is
glowing
with
the
power
of
my
ancestors
of
maui
the
strong
ah
his
great
power
attempted
his
greatest
deed
to
take
the
heart
of
that
man
may
live
for
ever
but
his
incantations
were
overcome
by
the
mother
of
all
and
she
swallowed
him
as
she
swallows

but
ah
for

ah
for
rangi
what
would
have
become
of
maui
but
a
prey
of
the
birds
of
the
sea
ah
tama
found
a
bundle
of
jellyfish
and
on
the
shore
and
the
were
collecting
around
it
fighting
and
screaming
so
he
went
and
stripping
the
fish
and
he
saw
that
they
were
covering
and
enclosing
a
child
ah
behold
maui
the
infant
reared
and
fashioned
by
the
fish
and
the
weeds
and
the
waves
by
storms
and
gales
of
the
rolling
sea
ah
but
for

what
would
have
become
of

alone
on
the
shore
what
but
a
prey
of
the
ah
listen
before
his
time
maui
was
born
and
taranga
his
mother
who
gave
birth
to
him
on
the
border
of
the
sea
knew
that
he
could
not
live
therefore
she
cut
her
hair
and
wrapping
it
around
him
she
threw
him
into
the
surf
of
the
sea
ah
she
sang
many
incantations
which
have
power
over
the
evil
spirits
for
know
my
listener
they
are
watching
for
the
children
who
are
born
to
life
before
their
life
is
ripe
they
try
to
enter
the
body
and
fill
the
departing
spirit
of
the
child
with
hatred
for
man
for
the
departing
spirit
will
never
know
and
receive
the
joys
of
man
and
therefore
friend
the
children
form
the
multitude
of
evil
spirits
ah
great
were
taranga
s
incantations
but
what
would
have
become
of
maui
but
for
the
love
of
tangaroa

the
god
of
the
oceans
his
are
the
waves
and
they
rolled
and
rocked
the
child
to
sleep
and
they
fashioned
him
and
gave
him
strength
and
they
took
possession
of
him
and
gave
him
the
power
of
the
sea
and
the
wisdom
of
the
sea
their
great
incantations
which
unite
heaven
and
earth
and
they
gave
him
the
terrible
witchcraft
of
the
sea
then
rolling
him
gently
on
the
sand
of
the
beach
the
jellyfish
robed
him
and
the
seaweeds
ah
my
listener
rangi
became
his
father
and
he
lived
with
him
till
he
grew
into
manhood
many
were
his
deeds
and
great
was
his
cunning
he
learned
powerful
incantations
and
he
learned
how
to
take
the
shape
of
the
birds
at
last
a
great
longing
for
his
parents
and
his
brothers
grew
in
his
heart
and
he
set
out
to
seek
them
for
his
heart
was
longing
for
them
he
wandered
and
wandered
toward
the
edge
of
the
ascending
sun
and
many
days
more
he
wandered
till
he
came
to
the
great
and
all
the
people
were
there
and
full
of
enjoyment
and
happiness
he
saw
a
woman
who
was
counting
her
sons
my
eldest
my
my
third
son
and
my
other
son
and
perceiving
she
demanded
whom
do
i
see
among
my
children
maui
assuming
before
her
eyes
the
form
of
a
pigeon
flew
upon
the
forehead
of
rangi
whose
carved
image
supported
the
house
and
sitting
there
he
spoke
if
you
are
taranga
my
mother
then
know
that
i
am
your
youngest
ha
great
was
the
wisdom
given
him
by
tangaroa
and
great
was
his
beauty
and
strength
fashioned
by
the
storms
of
the
sea
so
that
when
he
took
the
form
of
man
again
his
mother
saw
his
great
beauty
and
she
believed
in
him
and
knew
that
he
was
her
son
and
she
spoke
do
you
come
from
the
north
and
maui
answered
and
again
she
asked
do
you
come
from
the
south
maui
again
answered
and
she
asked
again
do
you
come
from
the
west
maui
again
answered
and
she
spoke
again
do
you
come
from
the
east
and
again
maui
answered
she
said
do
you
come
on
the
waves
of
the
sea
and
maui
spoke
the
waves
of
the
sea
rolled
and
she
said
do
you
come
on
the
waves
of
the
wind
and
maui
said
yes
then
taranga
cried
it
is
true
he
is
the
youngest
son
to
whom
i
gave
birth
and
cast
his
body
into
the
sea
because
his
life
was
not
ripe
he
is
here
again
he
is
alive
it
is
true
it
is
true
it
is
true
he
is
my
son
he
is
ah
listen
my
friend
to
maui
maui
my
ancestor
three
times
he
slept
in
the
house
of
his
mother
but
every
morning
when
he
awoke
he
found
his
mother
had
disappeared
before
the
next
night
when
taranga
had
come
again
to
sleep
with
her
sons
he
waited
till
all
were
asleep
and
then
he
closed
every
hole
and
rent
through
which
light
could
come
into
the
house
and
put
away
taranga
s
and
belt
that
she
might
not
be
able
to
go
away
again
in
the
darkness
now
taranga
slept
till
the
sun
was
standing
high
and
she
cried
and
searched
for
her
garment
and
belt
not
finding
them
she
covered
herself
with
an
old
mat
and
ran
to
a
tuft
of
reeds
which
grew
near
the
house
and
disappeared
beneath
it
maui
followed
her
and
lifting
the
tuft
he
found
that
it
covered
the
entrance
to
a
cave
illustration
maui
chanting
incantations
quickly
now
he
changed
himself
into
a
pigeon
and
binding
the
white
belt
of
his
mother
around
his
neck
and
her
black
before
his
breast
he
flew
to
the
entrance
of
the
cave
and
entering
it
he
flew
and
flew
and
flew
through
the
long
and
dark
cave
till
he
saw
at
last
the
people
of
another
world
thither
he
flew
and
rested
upon
a
large
tree
sitting
there
he
perceived
that
his
mother
and
father
were
among
the
people
and
he
threw
down
two
berries
hitting
both
his
mother
and
his
father
they
thought
the
berries
had
fallen
from
the
tree
and
took
no
heed
but
maui
threw
and
hit
them
again
and
then
again
at
last
all
saw
the
pigeon
and
they
began
to
throw
stones
to
kill
it
but
they
could
not
hit
maui
until
at
length
he
wanted
them
to
and
then
he
fluttered
down
to
the
feet
of
his
father
the
people
now
sprang
forward
to
kill
the
pigeon
but
maui
quickly
changed
into
a
man
again
so
that
they
were
struck
with
fear
and
looked
frightened
into
his
staring
red
eyes
they
were
as
red
as
if
they
were
painted
with
kokowai
ah
my
listener
taranga
seeing
her
son
chanted
the
great
song
of
welcome
of
the
people
of
hawaiki
and
then
staring
far
into
the
distance
she
sang
the
incantations
to
the
gods
who
record
the
past
and
with
their
help
she
narrated
to
the
people
all
that
had
taken
place
since
maui
s
birth
and
the
people
wondered
and
believed
that
maui
was
taranga
s
son
and
from
that
time
maui
lived
with
his
people
for
time
and
time
and
time
at
last
maui
full
of
knowledge
and
cunning
wished
for
a
weapon
so
that
he
might
perform
great
deeds
that
no
other
men
could
do
he
wished
for
a
sacred
weapon
and
he
held
many
karakias
to
the
gods
whose
abode
is
the
tools
of
the
warrior
one
day
he
asked
the
people
who
brought
food
every
day
to
his
grandfather
and
said
give
me
the
food
that
i
may
take
it
to
for
is
he
not
a
sacred
man
and
they
gave
it
to
him
and
he
carried
it
away
but
did
not
give
it
to
his
ancestor
many
were
the
days
that
passed
since
he
took
the
food
away
but
he
did
not
give
it
to
the
old
man
whose
cries
became
louder
and
louder
for
he
was
very
old
and
hungry
at
last
the
spirit
of
his
life
took
his
abode
in
the
jawbone
and
departing
from
there
to
be
swallowed
by
he
left
the
jawbone
as
his
last
tapu
sacred
behind
him
ah
behold
now
my
stranger
how
taking
the
sacred
jawbone
of
he
became
the
possessor
of
his
powerful
weapon

he
perform

his
sacred
weapon

reaches
a
place

the
river

not
touch
any
food
look
how
he

great
tapu

place

sacred
to
the
most
powerful
gods

and
look
ah

how
he
forms

jawbone

how

with
carvings
and
how
its
eyes
of
flash
fire
into
the
world

my
friend
how
he
with
great
cunning
fashions
the
teeth
into
barbs
ah
see
him
giving
to
his
weapon

great
name
of
his
ancestor
ha
now
he
held
the
great
karakia
over
his
making
it
sacred
as
an
abode
for
the
mightiest
gods
and
hiding
it
in
his
belt
he
went
back
to
his
brothers
and
he
watched
them
trying
to
catch
fish
but
could
never
land
them
for
their
hooks

no
barbs
he
said
laughingly
o
brothers

us
together
go
upon
the
sea
to
find
out
who
may
catch
the
largest
but
his
brothers
were
afraid
of
maui
and
his
cunning
and
witchcraft
they
did
not
like
him
in
the
canoe
and
therefore
they
left
so
early
next
morning
that
maui
had
to
stay
behind
when
maui
awoke
and
found
his
brothers
gone
he
laughed
and
changed
himself
into
the
little
bird
and
flew
out
upon
the
sea
when
he
had
reached
the
canoe
he
set
himself
upon
the
prow
and
began
to
twitter
and
sing
then
his
brothers
knew
him
and
cried

is
living

was
to

alone
had
the
courage
to
go
to
mahuika
to
ask
her
for
one
of
her
fingers

wandered
through
the
caves
of
the

and
nearer
and
nearer
he
approached
mahuika
his
heart
full
of
courage
and
cunning
but
ha
when
his
eyes
beheld
his
ancestress
he
began
to
tremble
so
that
he
could
not
speak
ah
friend
mahuika
was
beautiful
to
look
upon
in
her
dark
cave
surrounded
by
her
children
who
shone
forth
out
of
the
darkness
at

overcame
his
fear
and

spoke

some
of
your
fire

is
there
in
the
light
of
my
children
and
maui
answered
it
is
maui
your
mahuika
now
asked
him
the
four
sacred
questions
and
he
answered
them
as
he
had
answered
taranga
when
mahuika
knew
that
her
grandchild
was
standing
before
her
in
the
light
of
her
fire
and
she
spoke
yes
my
son
i
will
that
you
receive
the
fire
you
have
asked
for
and
she
took
one
of
her
fingers
and
gave
it
to
maui
with
the
fire
he
now
wandered
back
but
when
he
had
travelled
part
of
his
way
his
old
cunning
overmastered
him
and
he
resolved
to
take
all
the
fire
of
mahuika
ha
ha
he
killed
the
finger
mahuika
had
given
him
in
a
great
water
and
went
back
to
his
ancestress
to
ask
for
another
finger
telling
her
that
he
had
lost
the
first
one
and
mahuika
gave
him
another
finger
ha
ha
he
killed
the
second
finger
too
in
the
great
water
and
came
back
to
ask
for
more
and
his
ancestress
gave
him
another
finger
ha

ah
maui
came
again
and
again
and
mahuika
gave
him
all
her
fingers
till
she
had
only
one
left

ha
maui
killed
them
all
in
the
great
water
but
when
he
again
came
back
and
asked
for
the
last
finger
then
mahuika
knew
that
he
wished
to
deceive
her
and
kill
her
and
a
frightful
anger
took
hold
upon
her
ha
she
took
her
last
child
her
last
finger
and
threw
it
upon
the
world
and
the
world
filled
with
fire
ha
ah
then
maui
began
to
run
the
flames
grew
larger
and
larger
and
followed
him
he
ran
into
the
forests
and
the
forests
caught
fire
ah
maui
my
ancestor
ah
he
ran
into
the
river
but
the
river
began
to
boil
ah
he
took
the
form
of
an
eagle
but
the
flames
pursued
him
high
into
the
air
ha
he
sang
great
incantations
to
and
the
gods
and
they
sent
clouds
of
rain
the
clouds
wandered
forth
from
the
end
of
heaven
and
burst
into
rain
and
long
rain
fell
upon
the
fire
and
heavy
rain
and
lasting
rain
through
the
rain
flew
maui
and
threw
himself
into
the
sea
to
save
himself
from
the
terrible
wrath
of
his
ancestress
mahuika
ah
ah
my
listener
maui
had
almost
perished
through
the
terrible
fire
that
filled
the
world
but
mahuika
ah
mahuika
she
had
to
perish
in
the
endless
floods
which
fell
down
upon
the
world
she
knew
that
she
had
to
die
and
she
filled
the
world
with
terrible
cries
with
her
great
swiftness
for
is
she
not
the
mother
of
the
fire
she
ran
and
ran
to
save
her
child
the
flame
and
she
ran
and
ran
but
the
flood
of
the
rain
always
followed
her
at
last
knowing
that
she
must
die
she
took
her
last
child
her
last
finger
and
hid
it
in
the
tree
and
then
my
listener
the
rain
has
slain
the
mother
of
the
fire
ah
but
the
tree
has
sheltered
up
to
this
day
the
child
of
the
fire
so
that
men
take
its
dry
wood
and
rub
it
together
till
the
flame
which
once
lived
in
the
finger
of
mahuika
bursts
forth
to
new
life
again

have
heard
how
maui
cheated
his
ancestress
mahuika
and
nearly
perished
in
the
flames
listen
now
to
the
song
of
his
great
strength
and
braveness
that
you
may
know
how
he
once
fought
and
conquered
te
ra
the
sun
himself
these
are
my
words
they
were
the
days
when
our
ancestors
were
still
living
at
the
great
distance
the
days
were
short
and
te
ra
the
sun
wandered
through
the
heavens
and
through
the
lower
world
but
the
days
became
shorter
and
shorter
and
faster
and
faster
wandered
the
sun
through
the
heavens
ah
the
nights
grew
longer
and
longer
and
in
the
long
nights
grew
the
longing
for
longer
days
in
the
heart
of
maui
and
out
of
the
longing
was
born
his
great
cunning
plan
to
fight
the
sun
and
to
compel
him
to
create
longer
days
ah
listen
how
he
persuades
his
brothers
in
to
aid
him
in
his
work
frightened
were
his
brothers
at
first
but
when
he
showed
them
his
art
of
making
sacred
ropes
out
of
the
long
hair
of
women
and
of
forming
the
ropes
into
nooses
then
the
hearts
of
the
brothers
lost
their
fear
and
they
began
to
burn
with
eagerness
for
the
fight
yes
maui
taught
his
brothers
the
art
of
making
ropes
and
from
him
descended
his
wisdom
to
my
people
at
last
my
listener
all
ropes
and
nooses
were
ready
and
the
brothers
burdened
themselves
with
them
and
they
together
started
on
their
distant
journey
maui
took
his
sacred
the
end
of
heaven
and
land
and
showed
his
brothers
the
way
they
wandered
by
night
and
as
soon
as
the
sacred
red
broke
forth
at
they
hid
themselves
under
the
rocks
that
te
ra
might
not
see
them
and
again
they
wandered
forth
by
night
till
they
had
wandered
many
many
nights
and
they
at
last
reached
the
cliffs
of
the
caves
out
of
which
te
ra
ascended
in
the
mornings
ha
here
they
looked
for
shelter
and
maui
warned
his
brothers
not
to
expose
themselves
to
the
arrows
of
the
sun
that
they
might
not
be
killed
in
the
battle

hero

spoke
to
his
brothers
till
all
fear
had
left
their
hearts
and
the
desire
filled
them
to
fall
upon
their
enemy
and
then
maui
showed
them
how
they
could
catch
te
ra
in
their
ropes
and
he
showed
them
how
to
hold
the
ropes
tight
tight
and
tight
so
that
the
sun
would
be
powerless
and
he
could
kill
him

were
living
in
this
land
in
when
he
had
created

land
when
through
his
great
deed
he
had
compelled
to
prolong
the
days
that
the
hearts
of
his
descendants
may
be
gladdened
and
when
at

he
had
cheated
mahuika
out
of
her
flames
which
were
living
now
in
the
to
give
fire
and
warmth
to

here
he
found
his
parents
and
told
them
of
his
great
desire
but
his
parents
were

with
him
about
the
evil
trick
he
had
played
on

trick
which
had
nearly
cost

took

prayed
the

to
be
very
careful
and
very
quiet
and
not
to
laugh
for
he
was
going

undertake
his

threw
off

so
that
all

could
see
his
beautiful
tattoo
the
work
of
the

taking
his
enchanted

he
entered
the

the

the
little
birds
were
flying
and
fluttering
hither
and
thither
and
were
full
of
fear
for
maui
they
fluttered
noiselessly
through
the
bushes
and
higher
then
up
the
trees
and
looking
out
of
curiously
glittering
eyes
upon
maui
they
were
happy
beholding
the
wonderful
spectacle
of
maui
entering

then
was
it
that
the
little
bird
tiwakawaka
could
not
longer
be
silent
but
burst
out
into
a
heartfelt
twittering
laughter
ah
the
sweet
noise
awoke
the
old
goddess
and
opening
her
greenstone
eyes
she
saw
maui
and
his
doings
wrath
overcame
her
and
quickly
she
snapped
her
jaws
together
biting
through
maui
and
killing
him
with
her
sharp
teeth
of
obsidian

she
took
him
down

for
over

sweetly
sounds
the

off

oh
tutanekai
how
sweet
is
thy
music
to
my
heart
on
many
a
calm
night
has
hinemoa
listened
and
her
joy
grew
always
greater
and
her
heart
happier
within
her
sometimes
there
were
great
gatherings
of
the
people
on
the
mainland
in
the
pa
village
of
amukaria
hinemoa
s
father
and
tutanekai
came
over
but
he
felt
sorrowful
amidst
the
feasting
and
frolic
he
stole
quick
glances
at
the
beautiful
maiden
but
his
hand
was
trembling
and
he
was
ashamed
and
he
glanced
over
where
hinemoa
was
sitting
like
a
beautiful
white
heron
among
a
flock
of
kiwi
and
his
heart
was
frightened
he
was
frightened
and
ill
and
was
full
of
wrath
over
it
as
over
a
lizard
that
ate
away
his
heart
therefore
he
longed
for
powerful
enemies
to
fight
away
his
trembling
and
thus
to
forget
his
fear
so
he
collected
his
and
went
away
like
a
dark
cloud
to
the
tribe
of
his
enemies
challenging
them
to
battle
and
great
was
the
fighting
and
many
were
slain
but
tutanekai
was
victorious
so
that
he
took
many
slaves
and
made
great
offerings
to
the
god
of
war
the
great
battle
and
the
many
offerings
to
the
war
god
gladdened
his
heart
again
and
he
was
frightened
no
more
but
again
when
he
was
home
with
his
friend
tiki
his
music
wandered
over
the
water
and
took
his
heart
away
to
hinemoa
and
it
brought
back
her
image
as
she
listened
on
the
shore
and
sorrow
again
grew
within
him
so
he
sent
tiki
his
friend
to
hinemoa
to
tell
her
of
his
great
sorrow
in
being
away
from
her
and
to
ask
her
to
come
to
him
and
to
his
heart
that
it
might
lose
its
fright
and
be
full
of
gladness
watchful
was
amukaria
but
tiki
gave
his
message
and
full
of
gladness
answered
hinemoa
is
then
each
of
us
growing
in
the
heart
of
the
other
and
she
promised
to
come
to
tutanekai
in
a
canoe
late
on
a
black
night
when
he
would
play
his
sweetest
music
to
call
for
her
and
to
guide
her
in
the
darkness
amukaria
a
great
ariki
was
only
willing
to
give
hinemoa
as
wife
to
a
rangatira
of
a
very
high
mana
for
her
beauty
was
like
the
morning
sun
over
the
lake
and
he
knowing
the
power
and
danger
of
such
beauty
gave
order
that
all
the
canoes
should
be
taken
off
the
lake
thus
when
the
sweet
music
of
tutanekai
called
for
hinemoa
she
wandered
boatless
on
the
shore
her
heart
full
of
tears
for
she
could
not
answer
tutanekai
s
her
eyes
full
of
tears
ngawai
wandered
along
the
rolling
waves
telling
herself
in
low
tones
in
maori
of
all
the
sorrows
of
hinemoa
her
ancestress
ngawai
accompanies
her
mutterings
with
movements
which
express
despair
presses
her
hands
against
her
heart
stretches
her
arms
longingly
over
the
ocean
and
presses
them
again
to
her
bosom
then
she
speaks
with
a
different
voice
and
rapidly
one
evening
hinemoa
sat
listening
upon
the
rock
and
suddenly
the
longing
to
go
shook
her
as
an
earthquake
the
trembling
of
love
overtook
her
and
the
courage
of
love
overflowed
her
heart
she
went
to
the
and
took
six
dry
and
empty
gourds
and
tied
them
together
with
flax
for
floats
and
she
went
to
the
edge
of
the
water
called
threw
off
her
mat
of
kiwi
feathers
and
cast
herself
to
swim
the
long
long
way
with
the
help
of
the
floating
gourds
oh
my
friend
behold
hinemoa
like
a
beautiful
flying
star
casting
herself
into
the
water
oh
hinemoa
the
brave
silent
is
ngawai
her
lips
are
murmuring
incantations
to
tangaroa
her
hands
tremble
her
eyes
are
fixed
far
away
in
the
distance
ah
there
behold
she
is
there
where
the
stump
of
the
sunken
tree
stands
in
the
lake
oh
hinemoa
her
arms
are
weary
and
her
bosom
is
panting
as
she
holds
on
to
the
branches
of
the
tree
ah
now
has
darkness
swallowed
her
oh
her
heart
is
brave
on
she
goes
on
on
weary
her
limbs
her
breast
panting
darkness
around
but
nearer
and
nearer
comes
the
sweet
music
nearer
nearer
and
at
last
with
all
her
strength
gone
her
hands
reach
the
rocks
of
mokoia
where
the
hot
spring
is
in
the
cave
in
this
cave
she
took
shelter
for
she
was
cold
and
trembling
like
a
dead
leaf
trembling
were
her
hands
but
her
heart
was
full
of
joy
weary
were
her
limbs
but
her
love
was
great
and
happy
ngawai
is
striding
with
quick
steps
forward
heaving
is
her
bosom
but
in
her
eyes
is
fire
and
she
is
murmuring
to
herself
her
heart
and
thoughts
are
far
away
among
the
waves
of
the
lake
rotorua
battling
there
with
the
water
as
hinemoa
did
her
ancestress
long
long
was
the
way
over
the
water
oh
great
was
the
love
of
hinemoa
whilst
she
was
warming
herself
in
the
cave
there
appeared
at
the
narrow
edge
a
slave
sent
by
tutanekai
to
fetch
some
water
and
when
he
had
filled
his
calabash
hinemoa
called
out
to
him
slave
for
whom
is
that
water
and
the
frightened
slave
answered
for
tutanekai
my
hinemoa
spoke
if
it
is
for
tutanekai
then
give
it
to
me
and
the
frightened
slave
reached
her
the
calabash
and
she
drank
and
broke
it
on
the
rocks
the
slave
called
out
why
did
you
break
tutanekai
s
calabash
but
hinemoa
never
answered
again
did
tutanekai
send
the
slave
and
again
spoke
hinemoa
give
me
tutanekai
s
calabash
and
again
the
frightened
slave
reached
it
to
her
into
the
darkness
and
she
drank
and
broke
it
again
when
tutanekai
heard
the
words
of
the
slave
he
reached
full
of
wrath
for
his
of
whalebone
calling
so
that
it
sounded
all
over

the
children

mist
by
james
cowan
far
up
in
the
misty
mountains
dwell
the
the
fairies
of
maori
land
they
are
seldom
seen
and
indeed
most
mortals
who
have
no
gift
of
imagination
and
no
can
not
expect
to
behold
the
good
people
and
many
who
know
no
better
deny
their
existence
it
is
supposed
by
some
that
they
were
really
tribes
of
aborigines
whom
the
maoris
found
dwelling
in
this
wild
new
land
when
they
arrived
here
from
the
isles
of
polynesia
but
the
old
maoris
say
that
they
still
inhabit
certain
of
the
lofty
mountains
of
aotearoa
a
numerous
people
some
of
them
tiny
gnomes
and
elves
and
pixies
some
of
them
in
the
presentment
of
men
and
women
of
this
world
but
smaller
and
and
with
fair
hair
and
fair
skins
just
like
europeans
they
are
known
to
the
maoris
by
several
names
turehu
tahurangi
maero
and
but
their
common
designation
is
they
are
a
bright
cheerful
race
and
take
great
pleasure
in
music
they
are
skilled
in
charms
and
the
art
of
enchantment
and
many
a
strange
adventure
has
happened
to
the
maori
who
has
had
the
temerity
to
venture
into
their
haunts
like
the
elves
of
other
countries
these
fairies
of
maori
land
dread
daylight
and
appear
only
by
night
sometimes
on
dark
and
gloomy
days
when
the
thick
mists
descend
and
envelop
the
bare
crags
and
deep
ravines
of
the
mountains
of
the
south
the
fairy
people
will
be
heard
chanting
songs
in
a
thin
sweet
cadence
and
then
too
will
be
heard
the
doleful
sound
of
the
fairy
trumpet
and
the
faint
and
plaintive
music
of
the
koauau
or
and
the
voices
of
the
fairy
children
laughing
and
singing
above
the
clouds
but
most
of
all
they
love
the
mountains
of
the
north
the
fish
of
maui
where
they
live
in
their
little
pas
palisaded
like
those
of
the
maoris
and
adorned
with
quaint
little
carvings
and
diminutive
figures
of
fairy
ancestors
few
mortals
can
discover
those
pas
they
are
hidden
far
away
in
the
shadiest
recesses
of
the
bush
where
the
hover
all
day
long
and
where
the
goddess
of
the
clouds
descends
nightly
and
covers
her
fairy
children
with
her
loving
mantle
a
tohunga
alone
can
perceive
those
stockades
and
houses
of
the
to
ordinary
folk
who
penetrate
the
fairy
country
those
works
of
the
little
people
are
to
all
appearance
mere
trees
and
rocks
and
beds
of
ferns
but
if
you
have
the
wise
eye
and
the
tohunga
s
understanding
you
will
see
that
the
great
rimu
pine
with
its
drooping
waterfall
of
golden
foliage
and
the
kahikatea
tall
and
stately
the
knotted
and
gnarled
rata
the
graceful
nikau
palm
and
the
lovely
swishing
gently
its
broad
are
all
part
and
portion
of
the
dwellings
for
the
fairies
are
ever
of
the
forests
with
the
they
live
and
with
the
passing
of
the
forests
they
too
pass
away
many
are
the
stories
told
of
the
fairy
people
and
their
encounters
with
mortals
one
story
says
that
it
was
from
a
party
of
fairies
who
were
fishing
by
night
for
mackerel
tawatawa
in
a
bay
in
the
far
north
where
they
were
joined
by
adventurous
maoris
and
who
being
surprised
by
daylight
fled
leaving
their
nets
on
the
beach
that
the
maori
people
first
learned
the
pattern
and
hitch
used
in
making
the
large
seine
harmless
as
the
ordinarily
were
they
yet
could
worry
mortals
considerably
on
occasion
some
hapus
of
fairies
for
instance
were
in
the
habit
of
making
periodical
nocturnal
expeditions
to
the
homes
of
the
maoris
and
carrying
off
their
wives
the
korako
or
albinos
sometimes
seen
amongst
the
maoris
are
said
to
be
the
offspring
of
these
unions
though
in
the
far
north
they
are
spoken
of
as
the
children
of
kehua
ghostly
visitants
and
the
women
of
this
world
one
of
these
stories
of
by
the
fairies
relates
to
mt
pirongia
this
beautiful
mountain
with
its
dense
woody
ridges
and
valleys
its
cascading
brooks
and
its
rocky
fastnesses
is
in
maori
eyes
the
abode
of
hosts
of
in
the
dark
moonless
nights
the
lone
out
on
the
waipa
banks
would
start
in
affright
when
on
his
imaginative
ear
broke
the
sound
of
the
fairies
singing
in
their
pas
and
he
would
promptly
fortify
himself
against
their
magic
wiles
by
reciting
potent
karakia
or
incantations
and
would
chant
a
high
quavering
waiata
to
scare
away
the
goblins
of
the
night
one
day
long
ago
te
puhi
and
i
were
out
far
up
the
wooded
slopes
of
mt
pirongia
evening
had
come
upon
us
while
we
were
intent
upon
bagging
the
children
of
tane
and
as
we
had
a
long
and
toilsome
journey
down
the
bush
ridges
and
across
rapid
creeks
to
make
before
we
reached
the
old
frontier
township
of
alexandra
my
maori
companion
and
i
decided
upon
spending
the
night
in
the
forest
so
selecting
a
comfortable
nook
beneath
the
spreading
branches
of
a
fine
old
rata
tree
we
were
soon
enjoying
a
savoury
meal
of
fat
pigeons
roasted
over
the
camping
fire
with
the
pith
of
the
nikau
palm
in
lieu
of
bread
sank
down
beyond
the
westernmost
peak
into
his
ocean
cave
the
evening
mists
crept
up
from
the
murmuring
streams
and
the
gloomy
gullies
and
stole
noiselessly
along
the
dark
forest
ranges
and
the
the
soft
dews
descended
on
the
earth
and
there
was
something
uncanny
in
the
long
dancing
gleams
of
light
which
shot
through
the
forest
from
our
bivouac
fire
the
black
shadows
of
the
woodland
swayed
like
ghosts
with
the
flickering
of
the
flames
and
puhi
squatting
close
by
the
fire
gazed
half
fearfully
down
the
gloomy
forest
aisles
and
presently
in
subdued
tones
as
if
he
were
chary
of
arousing
the
genii
of
the
bush
by
too
loud
a
tongue
he
told
the
story
of
the
fairies
o
friend
of
mine
listen
this
is
the
belief
of
our
people
this
peak
of
pirongia
is
an
enchanted
mountain
and
it
is
well
that
you
a
pakeha
are
with
me
else
would
i
perchance
be
visited
by
the
fairy
tribe
who
dwell
upon
these
heights
pirongia
is
a
that
is
a
peak
sometimes
when
it
is
fine
weather
below
on
the
plains
thunder
will
be
heard
rolling
along
the
summit
and
the
lightning
will
be
seen
darting
downwards
upon
its
topmost
peak
that
is
a
tohu
maté
an
omen
of
death
or
misfortune
to
the
maoris
some
chief
of
our
tribe
will
die
or
some
untoward
event
will
overtake
the
people
and
high
up
around
the
top
of
the
mountain
live
the
a
great
many
years
ago
many
generations
before
the
pakeha
came
to
these
shores
and
when
the
plains
below
us
here
were
covered
with
the
fires
of
the
maoris
there
lived
at
the
foot
of
this
mountain
near
the
waipa
river
a
chief
named
ruarangi
of
the
tribe
to
which
i
too
belong
his
wife
was
named
tawhaiatu
and
she
was
a
woman
of
fine
appearance
a
beautiful
woman
in
the
eyes
of
the
maori
and
the
fairies
of
the
mountain
also
considered
her
a
fine
wahine
for
one
morning
when
ruarangi
returned
to
his
house
in
the
early
dawn
after
having
been
out
all
night
he
found
that
his
wife
had
disappeared
he
searched
long
for
her
and
called
her
name
aloud
but
to
no
avail
when
full
daylight
came
ruarangi
greatly
sorrowing
took
his
spear
in
his
hand
and
placed
his
stone
weapon
in
his
belt
and
went
along
the
track
in
the
direction
of
the
mountain
where
the
fairies
dwelt
for
he
knew
that
his
wife
had
been
carried
off
by
a
and
as
he
paused
awhile
on
his
way
he
stretched
forth
his
spear
towards
the
and
wept
and
chanted
his
song
of
lamentation
for
his
vanished
wife
my
message
of
love
blows
afar
borne
on
the
eastern
breeze
a
token
of
sorrow
from
the
beloved

like

my
tears
down
and
lying
in
wait
for
two
days
near
the
forest
pa
ruarangi
performed
the
ceremonies
and
repeated
the
incantations
to
recover
his
ravished
wife
by
stratagem
he
gained
the
place
where
she
had
been
taken
to
by
the
fairy

did
not
perceive
him
else
had
he
been
a
dead
man
and
in
haste
he
took
her
before
her
fairy
husband
could
follow
in
pursuit
and
they
reached
their
village
on
the
banks
of
the
waipa
in
safety
but
ruarangi
and
his
wife
knew
that
though
they
were
back
in
their
home
the
fairy
chief
or
his
followers
would
come
by
night
and
endeavour
to
regain
possession
of
her
their
hearts
sank
as
they
communed
long
with
one
another
in
the
shelter
of
their
raupo
house
and
planned
how
to
prevent
the
fairies
from
again
carrying
tawhaiatu
away
and
at
night
there
came
the
spirit
of
one
of
their
priestly
ancestors
and
it
sat
on
the
of
their
house
and
the
thin
whistling
voice
of
the
wairua
spoke
down
to
them

they
sat
by

when
the
fairies
come
and
see
that
you
have
covered
everything
over
with
kokowai
they
will
be
afraid
to
enter
into
your
house
at
night
to
steal

morning
ruarangi
and
his
wife
went
forth
and
gathered

sacred

mixing
it
painted
the
whole
of

inside

house

the
and
the
door

also
painted
their
bodies
with
it
and
as
evening
came
on
they
lit
a
fire
in
the
house
and
awaited
the
coming
of

at
night
in

black
darkness
there
came
to
the
house
of
ruarangi
the
fairy
chief
from

he
stood
in
the
marae
outside
the
door
and
as
he
looked
into
the
house
and
saw
the
red
kokowai
on
the
posts
and
walls
and
on
the
bodies
of
the
man
and
woman
who
sat
by
the
fire
repeating
incantations
he
grew
afraid
and
remained
outside
in
the
courtyard
he
raised
his
voice
in
a
song
of
lamentation
for
he
loved
tawhaiatu
but
he
could
not
prevail
against
the
sacred
kokowai
and
the
powerful
spells
of
ruarangi

then
the
fairy
returned
sorrowing
to

followed

many
warriors

along

were
preparing
for
a
great
slaughter
and
a
feasting
on

the
time
for
travelling
was
not

the
greatest
rage
was
in
the
heart
of
tihi

he
built
high
palisades
around
his
pa
the
strongest
and
highest
in
all
the
land
but
in
the
shade
of
the
evenings
his
mind
kept
ever
forming
the
image
of
the
beautiful
maiden
then
his
heart
began
to
tremble
and
the
war
god
was
hidden
by
clouds
and
he
sat
lonely
and
made
presents
to
the
tohungas
that
they
may
hold
incantations
to
the
gods
who
govern
the
heart
and
desires
of
women
ah
it
was
at
that
time
that
far
in
sat
listless
and
lonely
on
the
shores
of
the
sea

many
days
and
many
nights
did
she
sit
there
listless
and
lonely
one
morning
while
the
sun
was
rising
out
of
the
sea
she
could
bear
it
no
longer
she
called
her
slave
to
put
some
food
into
a
basket
and
bade
her
follow
her
ah
my
friend

was
the
beginning
of
s
great
wandering
over
the
pathless
land
through
the
dark
forests
and
along
the
endless
shores

she
followed
the
gods

had
gained

them
on
and
on
living
on
the
wild
berries
of

forest
and
on
the
food
that
the
shores
of
the
sea
offered
her
sleeping
under
the
rocks
and
upon
the
branches
of
the
trees
always
living
in
fear
of
the
multitude
of
bad
spirits
ah
the
incantations
of
tihi
sent
courage
in
her
heart
and
the
longing
to
overcome
all
fear

last
she
came
to
the
pa
and
there
she
asked
for
but
tihi
was
living
in
his
pa

she
went
up
the
river
in
a
canoe
and
the
people
of
the
pas
on
the
shores
were
good
to
her
and
gave
her
food

marvelled
at
her
beauty

questions

asked
as
to
where
she
might
find

one
evening

that
their

filled

covered

of

captured

now
again
breaking

roused
the
passions
of
the
giants
she
made
the
volcanoes
tremble
their

shook
them

smiling
at
both
at

the
two
rivals
decided
to
fight
for
tongariro
now
followed
days
of
silence
the
giants
stood
there
grim
and
silent
to
the
world
but
they
were
gathering
strength
and
were
melting
stones
in
their
insides
and
lit
terrible
fires
their
powerful
weapons
so
they
stood
silent
and
grim
the
sun
gilding
their
beautiful
garments
of
snow
and
tongariro
smiled
at
them
with
her
graceful
swaying
column
of
steam
and
the
maori
people
looked
wonderingly
upon
the
peaceful
landscape
then
a
rolling
grew
into
the
nights
and
rolling
filled
the
days
louder
and
louder
night
after
night
day
after
day
a
terrible
groaning
damp
and
deep
suddenly
a
crashing
thunder
shook
the
earth
and
bursting
forth
from
the
mouth
of
ruapehu
a
fiery
mass
of
molten
stones
and
black
hate
and
fury
fell
upon
taranaki
covering
him
with
a
terrible
coat
of
fire
whilst
the
flying
winds
howled
and
the
melted
fled
thundering
down
into
the
valleys
a
beautiful
straight
form
gave
the
mass
of
fire
and
ashes
to
taranaki
but
he
shook
in
terrible
rage
he
tore
himself
out
of
the
ground
shaking
the
earth
and
breaking
the
lands
asunder
he
tried
to
fly
at
ruapehu
to
kill
him
with
his
weight
but
ruapehu
made
the
water
of
his
lake
high
up
in
the
snows
boil
and
hurling
it
down
it
filled
all
the
rends
taranaki
had
made
in
the
earth
and
burned
all
the
inside
of
the
earth
and
of
taranaki
himself
he
now
tearing
the
air
with
his
roaring
cries
of
pain
and
thundering
howling
of
rage
threw
a
tremendous
mass
of
stones
at
his
enemy
and
broke
the
highest
cone
the
loftiest
peak
of
ruapehu
so
that
his
looks
were
not
so
majestic
and
his
reach
not
so
far
into
the
skies
ruapehu
now
in
deadly
hate
swallowed
his
broken
cone
and
melted
it
he
lit
terrible
fires
in
his
inside
which
spread
to
the
lake
so
that
it
rose
and
boiled
the
steam
covering
all
the
world
and
blinding
taranaki
then
ruapehu
filled
himself
with
the
boiling
water
and
throwing
it
out
of
his
mouth
down
upon
taranaki
it
filled
all
the
crevices
and
it
lifted
him
for
he
himself
had
loosened
his
bonds
with
the
earth
and
now
darkening
day
into
night
he
sent
the
molten
mass
of
his
swallowed
cone
against
his
enemy
so
that
he
was
compelled
to
retreat
blinded
by
steam
burned
in
his
inside
by
the
boiling
water
and
covered
with
the
molten
mass
of
the
cone
of
ruapehu
he
himself
had
broken
he
groaned
and
rose
and
tumbled
and
shook
himself
and
he
felt
for
a
way
to
the
sea
to
cool
his
burning
pain
howling
in
unbearable
pain
he
had
to
run
in
order
to
get
out
of
reach
of
ruapehu
deeply
hollowing
his
path
through
the
lands
but
his
conqueror
ruapehu
melting
all
his
ice
and
snow
sent
it
as
boiling
water
into
this
deep
path
that
his
enemy
might
not
come
back
again
for
his
strength
also
was
exhausted
on
to
the
sea
went
taranaki
and
when
his
pain
had
left
him
a
little
he
looked
back
at
his
conqueror
and
saw
how
his
three
peaks
were
again
covered
with
fresh
snow
and
how
he
was
now
the
supreme
lord
over
all
the
lands
and
the
husband
of
tongariro
they
two
were
now
the
arikis
over
all
the
land
but
it
was
waste
now
and
dead
for
the
terrible
fight
had
killed
all
the
people
and
the
living
beings
all
around
once
more
a
burst
of
black
anger
broke
forth
from
taranaki
and
again
it
was
answered
by
a
wonderful
swaying
and
smiling
from
tongariro
and
then
he
went
and
wandered
along
the
coast
till
he
had
found
a
place
for
his
sorrow
there
he
stands
now
brooding
on
revenge
and
my
people
know
that
one
day
he
will
come
back
in
a
straight
line
to
fight
ruapehu
again
and
none
of
my
people
will
ever
live
or
be
buried
in
that
lime
for
one
day
he
will
come
back
to
fight
for
tongariro
who
knows
but
the
path
of
taranaki
to
the
sea
is

was
a
bold
and
cunning
man
he
invited
the
on
board
the
arawa
to
perform
the
sacred
rites
appropriate
on
the
occasion
of
putting
to
sea
and
then
refused
to
allow
him
on
shore
again
he
carried
him
off
across
the
ocean
to
be
the
arawa
s
priest
knowing
that
ngatoro
was
under
the
protection
of
the
atuas
and
ancestral
spirits
of
the
race
and
that
he
was
indeed
almost
a
god
in
himself
while
crossing
the
ocean
in
search
of
the
new
land
clandestinely
gained
the
affections
of
the
lady
kearoa
the
wife
of
who
had
accompanied
her
husband
when
ngatoro
discovered
this
he
resolved
to
destroy
the
canoe
and
all
that
were
on
board
so
to
this
end
he
directed
the
bow
of
the
arawa
straight
towards
the
the
mouth
of
the
a
terrible
whirlpool
or
maelstrom
in
which
had
sucked
down
many
a
vessel
to
destruction
the
craft
entered
the
outer
circle
of
the
maelstrom
swiftly
approached
the
fatal
spot
where
the
ocean
god
drew
down
the
waters
with
an
awful
roaring
noise
the
people
in
their
terror
cried
to
to
save
them
but
he
heeded
not
then
stood
up
ika
one
of
the
chiefs
on
board
and
recited
a
karakia
to
rangi
the
sky
god
praying
him
to
save
the

the
ribs
of

and
beat
down
the
angry
waves
of

but
the
ears
of
the

were
closed
and
downwards
surged
the

the
roaring
of
the
grew
more
terrifying
and
the
men
and
women
and
children
on
board
cried
again
to
to
save
them
and
the
rose
and
in
a
wild
chant
he
invoked
tangaroa
the
ocean

called
upon

can
not
be
violated
no
not
even
by
the

bones
of

grows
overpowering
beneath
the
still
angry
none
dares
touch
the
remains

them
be

they
are
upon
