preface
once
upon
a
time
i
found
myself
halting
between
two
projects
both
magnificent
for
the
first
indeed
which
was
to
discover
digest
and
edit
all
the
fairy
tales
in
the
world
i
was
equipped
neither
with
learning
nor
with
command
of
languages
nor
with
leisure
nor
with
length
of
years
it
is
a
task
for
many
men
clubbing
their
lifetimes
together
but
the
second
would
have
cost
me
quite
a
respectable
amount
of
toil
for
it
was
to
translate
and
annotate
the
whole
collection
of
stories
in
the
des
now
the
des
in
the
copy
on
my
shelves
extends
to
volumes
printed
as
their
tell
at
geneva
between
the
years
and
and
published
in
paris
by

the
dates
may
set
us
moralising
while
the
rue
serpente
unfolded
as
though
per

its
playful
voluminous
coils
the
throne
of
france
with
the
ancien
régime
rocked
closer
and
closer
to
catastrophe
in

just
as
cuchet

leisurable

up
his

with

et

they
toppled
over
with
the
fall
of
the
bastille
even
so
in
england
we
may
remind
ourselves
in
when
the
gods
made
oliver
cromwell
protector
izaak
walton
chose
to
publish
a
book
about
little
fishes
but
the
reminder
is
not
quite
apposite
for
angling
the
contemplative
man
recreation
was
no
favourite
or
characteristic
or
symbolical
pursuit
of
the
order
which
cromwell
overthrew
and
besides
he
did
not
overthrow
it
whereas
volumes
most
pertinently
as
well
as
amply
illustrated
some
real
qualities
and
those
the
most
amiable
of
the
ancien
régime
when
we
think
of
the
french
upper
classes
from
the
days
of
louis
xiv
to
the
revolution
we
associate
them
with
a
certain
elegance
a
taste
fastidious
and
polite
if
artificial
in
the
arts
of
living
and
the
furniture
of
life
and
in
this
we
do
them
justice
but
if
i
mistake
not
we
seldom
credit
them
with
the
quality
which
more
than
any
other
struck
the
contemporary
foreign
observer
who
visited
france
with
a
candid
mind
i
mean
their
good
temper
we
allow
the
bastille
or
the
guillotine
to
cast
their
shadows
backward
over
this
period
or
we
see
it
distorted
in
the
glare
of
burke
rhetoric
or
of
carlyle
lurid
and
fuliginous
history
but
if
we
go
to
an
eyewitness
arthur
young
who
simply
reported
what
he
saw
having
no
rhetorical
axe
to
grind
or
guillotine
to
sharpen
we
get
a
totally
different
impression
the
last
of
young
in
actually
coincided
with
the
close
of
cuchet
pleasant
enterprise
in
publishing
and
i
do
not
think
it
fanciful
to
suppose
that
had
this
very
practical
englishman
found
time
to
read
at
large
in
the
des
he
would
have
discovered
therein
much
to
corroborate
the
evidence
steadily
and
unconsciously
borne
by
his
own
journals
that
the
urbanity
of
life
among
the
french
upper
classes
was
genuine
reflecting
a
real
and
for
a
whole
society
a
remarkable
sunniness
of
disposition
unconscious
of
their
doom
the
little
victims
played
but
they
did
play
and
they
fell
victims
not
to
their
own
passions
but
to
a
form
of
government
economically
rotten
of
all
the
volumes
in
the
possibly
the
most
famous
are
the
first
and
second
containing
the
fairy
tales
of
charles
perrault
and
madame
and
vols
containing
galland
version
so
much
better
than
any
translation
of
arabian
i
hope
that
one
of
those
days
dulac
will
lay
the
public
under
debt
by
illustrating
all
these
and
the
stories
of
antony
hamilton
to
boot
meanwhile
here
are
three
of
the
most
famous
tales
from
wallet
and
one
the
evergreen
and
the
by
an
almost
forgotten
authoress
madame
de
villeneuve
the
ghost
of
charles
perrault
could
it
walk
and
all
might
well
sigh
over
the
vanity
of
human
pretensions
for
monsieur
perrault
was
a
person
of
importance
in
his
lifetime
and
a
in
every
sense
of
the
term
colbert
made
him
secretary
of
the
academy
of
inscriptions
and
anon
controller
of
public
works
in
which
capacity
he
suggested
to
his
claude
perrault
the
facade
of
the
louvre
with
its
renowned
colonnade
he
flattered
his
monarch
with
a
poem
siècle
de
louis
le
ne
sais
observes
a
circle
ce
roi
malgré
son
amour
excessif
pour
la
flatterie
fut
content
les
bornes
étaient
the
poem
as
a
poem
had
little
success
but
by
positing
that
the
age
of
louis
was
the
greatest
in
history
and
suggesting
that
the
moderns
were
as
good
as
the
ancients
or
better
it
started
a
famous
controversy
boileau
racine
la
bruyère
honoured
him
by
taking
the
other
side
and
forced
him
to
develop
his
paradox
in
a
book
of
dialogues
des
anciens
et
des
but
his
best
answer
was
his
urbane
remark
for
he
kept
his
temper
admirably
that
these
gentlemen
did
ill
to
dispute
the
superiority
of
the
moderns
while
their
own
works
gave
proof
of
it
he
wrote
other
poems
other
tractates
including
one
on
the
men
of
his
age
besides
occasional
tracts
on
matters
of
high
politics
and
his
memory
is
kept
alive
by
one
small
packet
of
stories
which
he
heard
the
nurse
telling
his
little
boy
and
set
down
upon
paper
for
a
recreation
that
is
the
way
with
literary
fame
to
take
an
english
example
it
is
odds
that
southey
and
politician
of
great
in
his
day
will
come
finally
to
be
remembered
by
his
of
three
it
will
certainly
outlive
the
and
possibly
even
the
of
as
for
gabrielle
susanne
wife
of
de
gallon
seigneur
de
villeneuve
and
of
infantry
whom
she
outlived
she
wrote
a
number
of
romantic
stories
phénix
conjugal
le
juge
parvenu
le
supposé
la
jardinière
de
vincennes
le
prince
etc
i
am
not
perhaps
few
are
acquainted
with
these
works
madame
de
villeneuve
died
in
and
lives
only
by
grace
of
her
belle
et
la
and
that
again
lives
in
despite
of
its
literary
defects
it
has
style
but
the
style
inheres
neither
in
its
language
which
is
loose
nor
in
its
construction
the
story
as
she
wrote
it
tails
off
woefully
and
drags
to
an
end
in
mere
foolishness
since
perrault
who
is
usually
accepted
as
the
fountainhead
of
these
charming
french
belongs
almost
entirely
to
the
seventeenth
century
it
may
be
asked
why
dulac
has
chosen
to
depict
his
princes
and
princess
in
costumes
of
the
eighteenth
well
for
my
part
i
hold
that
he
has
obeyed
a
just
instinct
in
choosing
the
period
when
the
literature
he
illustrates
was
at
the
acme
of
its
vogue
but
his
designs
in
every
stroke
of
which
the
style
of
that
period
is
so
unerringly
felt
provide
his
best
apology
my
own
share
in
this
volume
is
perhaps
less
easily
defended
i
began
by
translating
perrault
tales
very
nearly
word
for
word
because
to
me
his
style
has
always
seemed
nearly
perfect
for
its
purpose
and
the
essence
of
in
writing
is
propriety
to
its
purpose
on
the
other
hand
the
late
ferdinand
brunetière
has
said
that
is
of
charm
and
on
this
subject
brunetière
opinion
must
needs
mine
ten
times
over
certainly
the
translations
when
finished
did
not
satisfy
me
and
so
i
turned
back
to
the
beginning
and
have
rewritten
the
stories
in
my
own
way
which
as
you
may
say
with
the
irish
butler
not
be
the
best
claret
but
is
the
best
got
i
have
made
bold
too
to
omit
perrault
conclusion
of
belle
au
bois
to
my
amazement
the
editor
of
the
des
selects
this
lame
sequel
it
is
no
better
than
a
sequel
of
a
lovely
tale
and
assigns
to
it
the
credit
of
having
established
véritable
fortune
de
ce
genre
frankly
i
can
not
believe
him
further
i
have
condensed
madame
de
villeneuve
narrative
and
obliterated
its
feeble
ending
in
taking
each
of
these
liberties
i
have
the
warrant
of
tradition
which
in
the
treatment
of
speaks
with
a
voice
more
authoritative
than
the
original
author
for
it
speaks
with
the
united
voices
of
many
thousands
of
children
his
audience
and
best
critics
as
the
children
have
decreed
that
in
southey
tale
of
three
the
heroine
shall
be
a
little
girl
and
not
as
southey
invented
her
a
old
woman
so
they
have
decreed
the
story
of
sleeping
to
end
with
the
prince
kiss
and
that
of

the
with
the

transformation

really

a
variant
of

immortal

might

spare

to
prove
to
you
that

who
lacked

one
thing
on

to
make
them
entirely
happy
the
was
young
handsome
and
wealthy
the
had
a
nature
as
good
and
gentle
as
her
face
was
beautiful
and
they
adored
one
another
having
married
for
love
which
among
kings
and
queens
is
not
always
the
rule
moreover
they
reigned
over
a
kingdom
at
peace
and
their
people
were
devoted
to
them
what
more
then
could
they
possibly
want
well
they
wanted
one
thing
very
badly
and
the
lack
of
it
grieved
them
more
than
words
can
tell
they
had
no
child
vows
pilgrimages
all
ways
were
tried
yet
for
a
long
while
nothing
came
of
it
all
and
the
poor
especially
was
in
despair
at
last
however
to
her
own
and
her
husband
inexpressible
joy
she
gave
birth
to
a
daughter
as
soon
as
the
palace
guns
announced
this
event
the
whole
nation
went
wild
with
delight
flags
waved
everywhere
bells
were
set
pealing
until
the
steeples
rocked
crowds
tossed
up
their
hats
and
cheered
while
the
soldiers
presented
arms
and
even
strangers
meeting
in
the
street
fell
upon
each
other
neck
exclaiming
has
a
daughter
yes
yes
our
has
a
daughter
long
live
the
little
a
name
had
now
to
be
found
for
the
royal
babe
and
the
and
after
talking
over
some
scores
of
names
at
length
decided
to
call
her
which
means
the
dawn
itself
thought
they
was
never
more
beautiful
than
this
darling
of
theirs
the
next
business
of
course
was
to
hold
a
christening
they
agreed
that
it
must
be
a
magnificent
one
and
as
a
first
step
they
invited
all
the
fairies
they
could
find
in
the
land
to
be
godmothers
to
the
that
each
one
of
them
might
bring
her
a
gift
as
was
the
pg
custom
with
fairies
in
those
days
and
so
she
might
have
all
the
perfections
imaginable
after
making
long
inquiries
for
i
should
tell
you
that
all
this
happened
not
so
many
hundred
years
ago
when
fairies
were
already
growing
somewhat
scarce
they
found
seven
but
this
again
pleased
them
because
seven
is
a
lucky
number
after
the
ceremonies
of
the
christening
while
the
trumpeters
sounded
their
fanfares
and
the
guns
boomed
out
again
from
the
great
tower
all
the
company
returned
to
the
royal
palace
to
find
a
great
feast
arrayed
seats
of
honour
had
been
set
for
the
seven
fairy
godmothers
and
before
each
was
laid
a
dish
of
honour
with
a
of
solid
gold
and
beside
the
dish
a
spoon
a
knife
and
a
fork
all
of
pure
gold
and
all
set
with
diamonds
and
rubies
but
just
as
they
were
seating
themselves
at
table
to
the
dismay
of
every
one
there
appeared
in
the
doorway
an
old
crone
dressed
in
black
and
leaning
on
a
crutched
stick
her
chin
and
her
hooked
nose
almost
met
together
like
a
pair
of
for
she
had
very
few
teeth
remaining
but
between
them
she
growled
to
the
guests
in
a
terrible
voice
am
the
fairy
pray
where
are
your
king
manners
that
i
have
not
been
invited
she
had
in
fact
been
overlooked
and
this
was
not
surprising
because
she
lived
at
the
far
end
of
the
country
in
a
lonely
tower
set
around
by
the
forest
for
fifty
years
she
had
never
come
out
of
this
tower
and
every
one
believed
her
to
be
dead
or
enchanted
that
you
must
know
is
the
commonest
way
the
fairies
have
of
ending
they
lock
themselves
up
in
a
tower
or
within
a
hollow
oak
and
are
never
seen
again
the
though
she
chose
to
accuse
his
manners
was
in
fact
the
politest
of
men
he
hurried
to
express
his
regrets
led
her
to
table
with
his
own
hand
and
ordered
a
dish
to
be
set
for
her
but
with
the
best
will
in
the
world
he
could
not
give
her
a
such
as
the
others
had
because
seven
only
had
been
made
for
the
seven
invited
fairies
the
old
crone
received
his
excuses
very
ungraciously
while
accepting
a
seat
it
was
plain
that
she
had
taken
deep
offence
one
of
the
younger
fairies
by
name
who
sat
by
overheard
her
mumbling
threats
between
her
teeth
and
fearing
she
might
bestow
some
unlucky
gift
upon
the
little
went
as
soon
as
she
rose
from
table
and
hid
herself
close
by
the
cradle
behind
the
tapestry
that
she
might
have
the
last
word
and
undo
so
far
as
she
could
what
evil
the
fairy
might
have
in
her
mind
she
had
scarcely
concealed
herself
before
the
other
fairies
began
to
advance
one
by
one
to
bestow
their
gifts
on
the
the
youngest
promised
her
that
she
should
be
the
most
beautiful
creature
in
the
world
the
next
that
she
should
have
the
wit
of
an
angel
the
third
a
marvellous
grace
in
all
her
ways
the
fourth
that
she
should
dance
to
perfection
the
fifth
that
she
should
sing
like
a
nightingale
the
sixth
that
she
should
play
exquisitely
on
all
instruments
of
music
now
came
the
turn
of
the
old
fairy
her
head
nodded
with
spite
and
old
age
together
as
she
bent
over
the
cradle
and
shook
her
crutched
staff
above
the
head
of
the
pretty
babe
who
slept
on
sweetly
too
young
and
too
innocent
as
yet
to
dream
of
any
such
thing
as
mischief
in
this
world
is
my
gift
to
you
announced
the
hag
still
in
her
creaking
voice
that
shook
as
spitefully
as
her
body
promise
that
one
day
you
shall
pierce
your
hand
with
a
spindle
and
on
that
day
you
shall
surely
die
at
these
terrible
words
the
poor
fell
back
fainting
into
her
husband
arms
a
trembling
seized
the
whole
court
the
ladies
were
in
tears
and
the
younger
lords
and
knights
were
calling
out
to
seize
and
burn
the
wicked
witch
when
the
young
fairy
stepped
forth
from
behind
the
tapestry
and
passing
by
who
stood
scornful
in
the
midst
of
this
outcry
she
thus
addressed
their
majesties
comfort
o
and
your
daughter
shall
not
die
thus
it
is
true
i
have
not
the
power
wholly
to
undo
what
this
elder
sister
of
mine
has
done
the
must
indeed
pierce
her
hand
with
a
spindle
but
instead
of
dying
she
shall
only
fall
into
a
deep
slumber

shall
last
for
many
many
years

and

illustration
head
nodded
with
spite
and
old
age
together
as
she
bent
over
the
cradle
the
while
declaring
himself
infinitely
obliged
to
the
good
fairy
could
not
help
feeling
that
hers
was
but
cold
comfort
at
the
best
he
gave
orders
to
close
the
christening
festivities
at
once
although
the
fairy
their
had
already
taken
her
departure
passing
unharmed
through
the
crowd
of
folk
every
one
of
whom
wished
her
ill
and
riding
away
it
was
generally
a
broomstick
to
satisfy
the
faithful
subjects
however
who
were
unaware
of
any
misadventure
the
palace
fireworks
were
duly
let
off
with
a
grand
wishing
life
to
the
princess
aurora
in
all
the
colours
of
the
rainbow
but
his
majesty
after
bowing
from
the
balcony
amid
the
banging
of
rockets
and
hissing
of
catherine
wheels
retired
to
a
private
room
with
his
chamberlain
and
there
still
amid
the
noise
of
explosions
and
cheering
drew
up
the
first
harsh
proclamation
of
his
reign
it
forbade
every
one
on
pain
of
death
to
use
a
spindle
in
spinning
or
even
to
have
a
spindle
in
his
house
heralds
took
copies
of
this
proclamation
and
marched
through
the
land
reading
it
to
the
sound
of
trumpets
from
every
and
it
gravely
puzzled
and
distressed
all
who
listened
for
their
women
folk
prided
themselves
on
their
linen
its
fineness
was
a
byword
throughout
the
neighbouring
kingdoms
and
they
knew
themselves
to
be
famous
for
it
what
sort
of
linen
said
they
his
majesty
have
us
spin
without
spindles
they
had
a
great
affection
however
as
we
have
seen
for
their
monarch
and
for
fifteen
or
sixteen
years
all
the
were
silent
throughout
the
land
the
little
grew
up
without
ever
having
seen
one
but
one
day
the
and
being
absent
at
one
of
their
country
houses
she
gave
her
governess
the
slip
and
running
at
will
through
the
palace
and
upstairs
from
one
chamber
to
another
she
came
at
length
to
a
turret
with
a
winding
staircase
from
the
top
of
which
a
strange
whirring
sound
attracted
her
and
seemed
to
invite
her
to
climb
as
she
mounted
after
the
sound
on
a
sudden
it
ceased
but
still
she
followed
the
stairs
and
came
at
the
very
top
to
an
open
door
through
which
she
looked
in
upon
a
small
garret
where
sat
an
honest
old
woman
alone
winding
her
distaff
the
good
soul
had
never
in
sixteen
years
heard
of
the
prohibition
against
spindles
and
this
is
just
the
sort
of
thing
that
happens
in
palaces
are
you
doing
goody
asked
the
am
spinning
pretty
one
answered
the
old
woman
who
did
not
know
who
she
was
what
is
that
wonder
sometimes
said
the
old
woman
the
world
is
coming
to
in
these
days
and
that
of
course
was
natural
enough
and
might
occur
to
anybody
after
living
so
long
as
she
had
lived
in
a
garret
on
the
top
of
a
tower
she
said
wisely
spinning
or
was
and
gentle
or
simple
no
one
is
fit
to
keep
house
until
she
has
learnt
to
spin
how
pretty
it
is
said
the
do
you
do
it
give
it
to
me
and
let
me
see
if
i
can
do
so
well
she
had
no
sooner
grasped
the
spindle
she
was
perhaps
or
just
a
little
bit
clumsy
or
maybe
the
fairy
decree
had
so
ordained
it
than
it
pierced
her
hand
and
she
dropped
down
in
a
swoon
the
old
trot
in
a
flurry
ran
to
the
head
of
the
stairs
and
called
for
help
there
was
no
bell
rope
and
her
voice
being
weak
with
age
and
her
turret
in
the
remotest
corner
of
the
palace
it
was
long
before
any
one
heard
her
in
the
servants
hall
the
servants
too
in
the
absence
of
the
and
were
playing
cards
and
could
not
be
interrupted
by
anybody
until
their
game
was
finished
then
they
sat
down
and
discussed
whose
business
it
was
to
attend
on
a
call
from
that
particular
turret
and
this
again
proved
to
be
a
nice
point
since
nobody
could
remember
having
been
summoned
thither
and
all
were
against
setting
up
a
precedent
as
they
called
it
in
the
end
they
decided
to
send
up
the
lowest
of
the
junior
but
he
had
a
weakness
which
he
somehow
forgot
to
mention
that
of
fainting
at
the
sight
of
blood
so
when
he
reached
the
garret
and
fainted
the
old
woman
had
to
begin
screaming
over
again
this
time
they
sent
up
a
scullery
maid
who
being
and
unused
to
the
ways
of
the
palace
made
the
best
haste
she
could
to
the
garret
whence
presently
she
returned
with
the
terrible
news
the
servants
who
had
gone
back
to
their
game
now
dropped
their
cards
and
came
running
all
the
household
in
fact
came
pouring
up
the
turret
stairs
the
palace
physicians
themselves
crowding
in
such
numbers
that
the
poor
would
have
been
hard
put
to
it
for
fresh
air
could
fresh
air
have
restored
her
they
dashed
water
on
her
face
unlaced
her
slapped
her
hands
tickled
the
soles
of
her
feet
burned
feathers
under
her
nose
rubbed
her
temples
with
they
held
consultations
over
her
by
twos
and
threes
and
again
in
grand
committee
but
nothing
would
bring
her
to
meanwhile
a
messenger
had
ridden
off
posthaste
with
the
tidings
and
while
the
doctors
were
still
consulting
and
shaking
their
heads
the
himself
came
galloping
home
to
the
palace
in
the
midst
of
his
grief
he
bethought
him
of
what
the
fairies
had
foretold
and
being
persuaded
that
since
they
had
said
it
this
was
fated
to
happen
he
blamed
no
one
but
gave
orders
to
carry
the
to
the
finest
apartment
in
the
palace
and
there
lay
her
on
a
bed
embroidered
with
gold
and
silver
at
sight
of
her
she
was
so
lovely
you
might
well
have
supposed
that
some
bright
being
of
the
skies
had
floated
down
to
earth
and
there
dropped
asleep
after
her
long
journey
for
her
swoon
had
not
taken
away
the
warm
tints
of
her
complexion
her
cheeks
were
like
carnations
her
lips
like
coral
and
though
her
eyes
were
closed
and
the
long
lashes
would
not
lift
her
soft
breathing
told
that
she
was
not
dead
the
commanded
them
all
to
leave
her
and
let
her
sleep
in
peace
until
the
hour
of
her
awakening
should
arrive
now
when
the
accident
befell
our
the
good
fairy
who
had
saved
her
life
happened
to
be
in
the
kingdom
of
mataquin
twelve
thousand
leagues
away
but
news
of
it
was
brought
to
her
in
an
incredibly
short
space
of
time
by
a
little
dwarf
who
owned
a
pair
of
boots
these
were
boots
in
which
you
could
walk
seven
leagues
at
a
single
stride
she
set
off
at
once
to
the
help
of
her
beloved
goddaughter
and
behold
in
an
hour
this
good
fairy
arrived
at
the
palace
in
a
fiery
chariot
drawn
by
dragons
our
met
her
and
handed
her
down
from
the
chariot
she
approved
of
all
that
he
had
done
but
greatly
foreseeing
as
she
was
she
bethought
her
that
as
all
mortals
perish
within
a
hundred
years
or
so
when
the
time
came
for
the
to
awake
she
would
be
distressed
at
finding
herself
orphaned
and
alone
in
this
old
castle
so
this
is
what
she
did
she
touched
with
her
wand
everything
and
everybody
in
the
palace
the
the
the
ministers
and
privy
councillors
the
archbishop
who
was
the
grand
almoner
the
bishops
and
the
minor
clergy
the
ladies
of
the
bedchamber
governesses
equerries
heralds
physicians
officers
masters
of
the
household
cooks
scullions
lackeys
guards
switzers
pages
footmen
she
touched
the
tutors
and
the
court
professors
in
the
midst
of
their
deep
studies
she
touched
likewise
all
the
horses
in
the
stables
with
the
grooms
the
huge
mastiffs
in
the
yard
even
the
little
pet
dog
and
her
cat
that
lay
coiled
on
a
cushion
by
her
bedside
the
instant
the
fairy
touched
them
they
all
fell
asleep
not
to
awake
until
the
same
moment
as
their
mistress
that
all
might
be
ready
to
wait
on
her
when
she
needed
them
the
very
spits
at
the
fire
went
to
sleep
loaded
as
they
were
with
partridges
and
pheasants
and
the
fire
went
to
sleep
too
all
this
was
done
in
a
moment
the
fairies
were
never
long
about
their
business
in
those
days
but
it
so
happened
that
one
of
the
councillors
the
minister
of
marine
his
office
dated
from
a
previous
reign
when
the
kingdom
had
hoped
to
conquer
and
acquire
a
seaboard
had
overslept
himself
that
morning
and
came
late
to
the
palace
without
any
knowledge
of
what
had
befallen
he
felt
no
great
fear
that
his
unpunctuality
would
be
remarked
the
as
he
supposed
being
absent
in
the
country
nevertheless
he
took
the
precaution
of
letting
himself
in
by
a
small
postern
door
and
so
missed
being
observed
by
the
fairy
and
touched
by
her
wand
entering
his
office
and
perceiving
that
his
usually
so
brisk
and
all
his
clerks
rested
their
heads
on
their
desks
in
attitudes
of
sleep
he
drew
the
conclusion
that
something
had
happened
for
he
was
an
excellent
judge
of
natural
slumber
the
farther
he
penetrated
into
the
palace
the
stronger
his
suspicions
became
he
withdrew
on
tiptoe
though
by
nature
and
habit
a
lazy
man
he
was
capable
of
sudden
decision
and
returning
to
his
home
he
caused
notices
to
be
posted
up
forbidding
any
one
to
approach
the
castle
the
inmates
of
which
were
suffering
from
an
eastern
but
temporary
affliction
known
as
the
sleeping
sickness
these
notices
were
unnecessary
for
within
a
few
hours
there
grew
up
all
around
the
park
such
a
number
of
trees
of
all
sizes
and
such
a
tangle
of
briars
and
undergrowth
that
neither
beast
nor
man
could
find
a
passage
they
grew
until
nothing
but
the
tops
of
the
castle
towers
could
be
seen
and
these
only
from
a
good
way
off
there
was
no
mistake
about
it
the
fairy
had
done
her
work
well
and
the
might
sleep
with
no
fear
of
visits
from
the
inquisitive
one
day
many
many
years
afterwards
the
incomparable
young
happened
to
ride
on
that
side
of
the
country
which
lay
next
to
the
tangled
forest
and
asked
were
those
towers
he
saw
pushing
up
above
the
midst
of
a
great
thick
wood
they
all
answered
him
as
they
heard
tell
some
said
it
was
an
old
castle
haunted
by
ghosts
others
that
all
the
wizards
and
witches
of
the
country
met
there
to
keep
sabbath
the
most
general
opinion
was
that
an
ogre
dwelt
there
and
that
he
carried
off
thither
all
the
children
he
could
catch
to
eat
them
at
his
ease
no
one
could
follow
him
for
he
alone
knew
how
to
find
a
passage
through
the
briars
and
brambles
the
could
not
tell
which
to
believe
of
all
these
informants
for
all
gave
their
versions
with
equal
confidence
as
commonly
happens
with
those
who
talk
on
matters
of
which
they
can
know
nothing
for
certain
he
was
turning
from
one
to
another
in
perplexity
when
a
peasant
spoke
up
and
said
highness
long
ago
i
heard
my
father
tell
that
there
was
in
yonder
castle
a
princess
the
most
beautiful
that
ever
man
saw
that
she
must
lie
asleep
there
for
many
many
years
and
that
one
day
she
will
be
awakened
by
a
king
son
for
whom
she
was
destined
at
these
words
prince
felt
himself
he
believed
without
weighing
it
that
he
could
accomplish
this
fine
adventure
and
spurred
on
by
love
and
ambition
he
resolved
to
explore
then
and
there
and
discover
the
truth
for
himself
illustration
they
grew
until
nothing
but
the
tops
of
the
castle
towers
could
be
seen
leaping
down
from
his
horse
he
started
to
run
towards
the
wood
and
had
almost
reached
the
edge
of
it
before
the
attendant
courtiers
guessed
his
design
they
called
to
him
to
come
back
but
he
ran
on
and
was
about
to
fling
himself
boldly
into
the
undergrowth
when
as
by
magic
all
the
great
trees
the
shrubs
the
creepers
the
ivies
briars
and
brambles
unlaced
themselves
of
their
own
accord
and
drew
aside
to
let
him
pass
he
found
himself
within
a
long
glade
or
avenue
at
the
end
of
which
glimmered
the
walls
of
an
old
castle
and
towards
this
he
strode
it
surprised
him
somewhat
that
none
of
his
attendants
were
following
him
the
reason
being
that
as
soon
as
he
had
passed
through
it
the
undergrowth
drew
close
as
ever
again
he
heard
their
voices
fainter
and
fainter
behind
him
beyond
the
barrier
calling
beseeching
him
to
desist
but
he
held
on
his
way
without
one
backward
look
he
was
a
prince
and
young
and
therefore
valiant
he
came
to
the
castle
and
pushing
aside
the
ivies
that
hung
like
a
curtain
over
the
gateway
entered
a
wide
outer
court
and
stood
still
for
a
moment
holding
his
breath
while
his
eyes
travelled
over
a
scene
that
might
well
have
frozen
them
with
terror
the
court
was
silent
dreadfully
silent
yet
it
was
by
no
means
empty
on
all
hands
lay
straight
stiff
bodies
of
men
and
beasts
seemingly
all
dead
nevertheless
as
he
continued
to
gaze
his
courage
returned
for
the
pimpled
noses
and
ruddy
faces
of
the
switzers
told
him
that
they
were
no
worse
than
asleep
and
their
cups
which
yet
held
a
few
heeltaps
of
wine
proved
that
they
had
fallen
asleep
over
a
he
stepped
by
them
and
passed
across
a
second
great
court
paved
with
marble
he
mounted
a
broad
flight
of
marble
steps
leading
to
the
main
doorway
he
entered
a
guardroom
just
within
the
doorway
where
the
guards
stood
in
rank
with
shouldered
muskets
every
man
of
them
asleep
and
snoring
his
best
he
made
his
way
through
a
number
of
rooms
filled
with
ladies
and
gentlemen
some
standing
others
sitting
but
all
asleep
he
drew
aside
a
heavy
purple
curtain
and
once
more
held
his
breath
for
he
was
looking
into
the
great
hall
of
state
where
at
a
long
table
sat
and
slumbered
the
with
his
council
the
lord
chancellor
slept
in
the
act
of
dipping
pen
into
inkpot
the
archbishop
in
the
act
of
taking
snuff
and
between
the
spectacles
on
the
archbishop
nose
and
the
spectacles
on
the
lord
chancellor
a
spider
had
spun
a
beautiful
web
tiptoed
very
carefully
past
these
august
sleepers
and
leaving
the
hall
by
another
door
came
to
the
foot
of
the
grand
staircase
up
this
too
he
went
wandered
along
a
corridor
to
his
right
and
stopping
by
hazard
at
one
of
the
many
doors
opened
it
and
looked
into
a
lined
with
mirrors
and
having
in
its
midst
sunk
in
the
floor
a
huge
round
basin
of
whitest
porcelain
wherein
a
spring
of
water
bubbled
deliciously
three
steps
led
down
to
the
bath
and
at
the
head
of
them
stood
a
couch
with
towels
and
laid
ready
exquisitely
embroidered
and
complete
to
the
daintiest
of
lace
ruffles
and
the
most
delicate
of
body
linen
then
the
bethought
him
that
he
had
ridden
far
before
ever
coming
to
the
wood
and
the
mirrors
told
him
that
he
was
also
somewhat
from
his
passage
through
it
so
having
by
this
time
learnt
to
accept
any
new
wonder
without
question
he
undressed
himself
and
took
a
bath
which
he
thoroughly
enjoyed
nor
was
he
altogether
astonished
when
he
tried
on
the
clothes
to
find
that
they
fitted
him
perfectly
even
the
rosetted
shoes
of
satin
might
have
been
made
to
his
measure
having
arrayed
himself
thus
hardily
he
resumed
his
quest
along
the
corridor
the
very
next
door
he
tried
opened
on
a
chamber
all
panelled
with
white
and
gold
and
there
on
a
bed
the
curtains
of
which
were
drawn
wide
he
beheld
the
loveliest
vision
he
had
ever
seen
a
princess
seemingly
about
seventeen
or
eighteen
years
old
and
of
a
beauty
so
brilliant
that
he
could
not
have
believed
this
world
held
the
like
but
she
lay
still
so
still
drew
near
trembling
and
wondering
and
sank
on
his
knees
beside
her
still
she
lay
scarcely
seeming
to
breathe
and
he
bent
and
touched
with
his
lips
the
little
hand
that
rested
light
as
a
on
the
coverlet
with
that
as
the
long
spell
of
her
enchantment
came
to
an
end
the
awaked
and
looking
at
him
with
eyes
more
tender
than
a
first
sight
of
him
might
seem
to
excuse
it
you
my
she
said
have
been
a
long
while
coming
the
charmed
by
these
words
and
still
more
by
the
manner
in
which
they
were
spoken
knew
not
how
to
find
words
for
the
bliss
in
his
heart
he
assured
her
that
he
loved
her
better
than
his
own
self
their
speech
after
this
was
not
very
coherent
they
gazed
at
one
another
for
longer
stretches
than
they
talked
but
if
eloquence
lacked
there
was
plenty
of
love
he
to
be
sure
showed
the
more
embarrassment
and
no
need
to
wonder
at
this
she
had
had
time
to
think
over
what
to
say
to
him
for
i
hold
it
not
unlikely
though
the
story
does
not
say
anything
of
this
that
the
good
fairy
had
taken
care
to
amuse
her
during
her
long
sleep
with
some
pleasurable
dreams
in
short
the
and
the
conversed
for
four
hours
and
still
without
saying
the
half
they
had
to
say
meanwhile
all
the
palace
had
awaked
with
the
in
the
council
chamber
the
opened
his
eyes
and
requested
the
lord
chancellor
to
read
that
last
sentence
of
his
over
again
a
little
more
distinctly
the
lord
chancellor
dipping
his
quill
into
the
dry
inkpot
asked
the
archbishop
in
a
whisper
how
many
t
there
were
in
the
archbishop
taking
a
pinch
of
snuff
that
had
long
ago
turned
to
dust
answered
with
a
terrific
sneeze
which
again
was
drowned
by
the
striking
of
all
the
clocks
in
the
palace
as
they
started
frantically
to
make
up
for
lost
time
dogs
barked
doors
banged
the
parrot
screamed
in
his
cage
and
was
answered
by
the
peacocks
squawking
from
the
terrace
amid
which
hubbub
the
minister
for
agriculture
forgetting
his
manners
made
a
trumpet
of
his
hands
and
bawled
across
the
table
begging
his
majesty
to
adjourn
for
dinner
in
short
every
one
first
thought
was
of
his
own
business
and
as
they
were
not
all
in
love
they
were
ready
to
die
with
hunger
even
the
who
had
dropped
asleep
while
discussing
with
her
the
shade
of
mourning
which
most
properly
expressed
regret
for
royal
personages
in
a
trance
lost
her
patience
at
length
and
sent
one
of
her
attendants
with
word
that
she
for
her
part
was
for
something
to
eat
and
that
in
her
young
days
it
had
been
customary
for
young
ladies
released
from
enchantment
to
accept
the
congratulations
of
their
parents
without
loss
of
time
the
by
this
message
recalled
to
his
devoirs
helped
the
to
rise
she
was
completely
dressed
and
very
magnificently
too
taking
his
beloved
by
the
hand
he
led
her
to
her
parents
who
embraced
her
passionately
and
their
first
transports
over
turned
to
welcome
him
as
a
son
being
charmed
quite
apart
from
their
gratitude
by
the
modest
gallantry
of
his
address
they
passed
into
a
great
lined
with
mirrors
where
they
supped
and
were
served
by
the
royal
attendants
violins
and
hautboys
discoursed
music
that
was
ancient
indeed
but
excellent
and
the
meal
was
scarcely
concluded
before
the
company
enjoyed
a
very
pleasant
surprise
having
no
eyes
but
for
his
love
might
be
excused
if
he
forgot
that
his
attendants
must
long
before
now
have
carried
home
their
report
and
that
his
parents
would
be
in
deep
distress
wondering
what
had
become
of
him
but
the
the
father
had
a
truly
royal
habit
of
remembering
details
especially
when
it
concerned
setting
folks
at
their
ease
before
dinner
he
had
dispatched
a
messenger
to
carry
word
to
father
that
his
son
was
safe
and
to
acquaint
him
briefly
with
what
had
befallen
the
messenger
riding
through
the
undergrowth
which
now
obligingly
parted
before
him
as
it
had
a
while
ago
to
admit
the
and
arriving
at
the
outskirts
of
the
wood
found
there
a
vainly
endeavouring
to
break
through
the
barrier
with
the
aged
father
standing
by
and
exhorting
them
in
person
to
whom
he
delivered
his
message
trembling
with
relief
for
he
truly
supposed
his
son
to
be
lost
beyond
recall
the
old
man
entreated
the
messenger
to
turn
back
and
escort
him
so
he
arrived
and
was
ushered
into
the
hall
the
situation
to
be
sure
was
delicate
but
when
these
two
kings
both
so
well
meaning
had
met
and
exchanged
courtesies
and
the
one
had
raised
the
other
by
the
hand
to
a
place
on
the
daïs
beside
him
already
and
without
speech
they
had
almost
accorded
am
an
old
man
said
the
father
have
reigned
long
enough
for
my
satisfaction
and
now
care
for
little
in
life
but
to
see
my
son
happy
think
i
can
promise
you
that
said
the
father
smiling
with
a
glance
at
the
two
lovers
am
old
enough
at
any
rate
to
have
done
with
ambitions
said
the
one
i
said
the
other
dreamed
long
enough
at
any
rate
to
despise
them
what
matters
ruling
to
either
of
us
two
while
we
see
your
son
and
my
daughter
reigning
together
so
it
was
agreed
then
and
there
and
after
supper
without
loss
of
time
the
archbishop
married
the
and
the
in
the
chapel
of
the
castle
the
two
kings
and
the
mother
saw
them
to
their
chamber
and
the
first
drew
the
curtain
they
slept
little
the
had
no
occasion
but
the
next
morning
led
his
bride
back
to
the
city
where
they
were
acclaimed
by
the
populace
and
lived
happy
ever
after
reigning
in
prosperity
and
honour
moral
maids
to
await
some
while
a
lover
fond
titled
debonair
as
florimond
reason
and
who
learns
on
fate
to
seldom
unrewarded
in
the
end
no
one
kiss
us
for
a
hundred
years
i
understood
my
another
the
story
would
suggest
a
may
happiest
when
deferr
you
cry
i
see
you
pout
we
skip
this
morale
and
attempt
a
another
our
able
then
appears
to
of
years
no
bar
to
age
and
youth
but
that
an
ancient
quarrel
i
not
interfere
there
no
third
blue
beard
in
the
east
in
a
city
not
far
from
baghdad
there
lived
a
man
who
had
many
possessions
and
might
have
been
envied
by
all
who
knew
him
had
these
possessions
been
less
by
one
he
had
fine
houses
in
town
and
country
retinues
of
servants
gold
and
silver
plate
in
abundance
coffers
heaped
with
jewels
costly
carpets
embroidered
furniture
cabinets
full
of
curiosities
gilded
coaches
teams
of
arab
horses
of
the
purest
breed
but
unluckily
he
had
also
a
blue
beard
which
made
him
so
frightfully
ugly
that
every
woman
wanted
to
scream
and
run
away
at
sight
of
him
among
his
neighbours
was
a
lady
of
quality
who
had
two
sons
and
two
daughters
upon
these
two
damsels
cast
his
affections
without
knowing
precisely
which
he
preferred
and
asked
the
lady
to
bestow
the
hand
of
one
of
her
daughters
upon
him
adding
not
too
tactfully
that
he
would
leave
the
choice
to
her
neither
nor
was
eager
for
the
honour
they
sent
their
suitor
to
and
fro
and
back
again
from
one
to
the
other
they
really
could
not
make
up
their
minds
to
accept
a
husband
with
a
blue
beard
it
increased
their
repugnance
for
they
were
somewhat
romantic
young
ladies
to
learn
that
he
had
already
married
several
wives
and
moreover
nobody
could
tell
what
had
become
of
them
which
again
was
not
reassuring
to
make
their
better
acquaintance
invited
them
with
their
mother
and
brothers
and
a
dozen
or
so
of
their
youthful
friends
to
divert
themselves
at
one
of
his
country
houses
where
they
spent
a
whole
fortnight
and
as
they
confessed
in
the
most
agreeable
pastimes
each
day
brought
some
fresh
entertainment
they
hunted
they
hawked
they
practised
archery
they
angled
for
or
were
rowed
to
the
sound
of
music
on
the
waters
of
their
private
canal
they
picnicked
in
the
ruined
castles
of
which
he
owned
quite
a
number
each
day
concluded
too
with
banqueting
dancing
theatricals
or
would
have
concluded
had
these
young
people
felt
any
disposition
to
go
to
bed
they
preferred
however
to
sit
up
until
morning
joking
and
teasing
one
another
who
had
arrived
at
middle
age
would
have
been
grateful
for
a
little
more
sleep
than
they
allowed
him
but
showed
himself
highly
complaisant
and
smiled
at
their
pranks
even
when
their
awe
of
him
having
worn
off
they
balanced
a
basin
of
water
above
his
chamber
door
to
fall
on
his
head
and
douch
him
or
sewed
up
his
or
stuffed
his
bolster
with
the
prickly
cactus
an
eastern
vegetable
of
which
he
possessed
whole
avenues
nay
even
when
for
the
same
mischievous
purpose
they
despoiled
his
garden
of
an
aloe
which
was
due
to
blossom
in
a
few
days
time
after
having
remained
flowerless
for
a
century
he
betrayed
no
chagrin
but
merely
raised
the
wages
of
his
over
the
loss
of
a
plant
so
economical
in
giving
pleasure
in
short
all
went
so
smoothly
that
the
younger
daughter
began
to
find
their
host
beard
not
so
blue
after
all
she
confided
this
to
her
mother
mother
she
said
is
doubtless
nothing
more
than
my
fancy
but
his
beard
seem
to
me
to
have
altered
in
colour
during
the
last
ten
days
a
very
little
of
course
you
too
have
observed
it
the
lady
interrupted
delightedly
dearest
child
you
can
not
imagine
how
your
words
relieve
me
for
a
week
past
i
have
accused
my
eyesight
of
failing
me
and
myself
of
growing
old
you
really
think
there
a
change
asked
at
once
doubtful
and
hoping
yes
ask
yourself
if
it
be
reasonable
to
suppose
that
our
eyes
are
playing
a
trick
on
both
of
us
not
her
mother
went
on
i
for
my
part
have
any
prejudice
against
blue
on
the
contrary
it
is
a
beautiful
colour
and
considered
lucky
the
poets
you
will
have
remarked
when
they
would
figure
to
us
the
highest
attainable
happiness
select
a
blue
flower
or
a
blue
bird
for
its
emblem
heaven
itself
is
blue
and
at
the
least
a
blue
beard
must
be
allowed
to
confer
distinction
hazarded
rather
her
mother
corrected
her
is
if
i
must
define
the
shade
as
it
appears
to
me
still
hesitated
it
has
begun
to
change
there
seems
no
reason
why
it
should
not
continue
to
do
so
darling
her
mother
kissed
her
is
precisely
the
point
its
colour
is
changing
you
say
but
for
what
reason
obviously
because
he
is
in
love
and
what
love
has
begun
love
can
carry
to
a
conclusion
nay
but
put
it
on
the
ground
of
pity
alone
could
a
feeling
heart
set
itself
any
task
more
angelic
than
to
rescue
so
worthy
a
gentleman
from
so
hideous
an
affliction
if
affliction
it
be
which
i
am
far
from
allowing
reflected
on
her
mother
advice
but
thought
it
prudent
to
consult
her
sister
and
her
before
coming
to
a
decision
which
once
taken
must
be
irrevocable
they
listened
to
her
very
though
to
tell
the
truth
all
three
were
somewhat
jaded
having
sat
up
all
night
at
the
playing
at
ombre
quadrille
lasquenet
and
heaven
knows
what
other
games
dear
said
her
sister
with
a
little
yawn
congratulate
you
with
all
my
heart
on
having
made
a
discovery
which
beyond
a
doubt
and
but
for
your
better
diligence
i
should
have
had
to
make
for
myself
before
long
as
for
her
they
were
in
the
best
of
humours
at
having
won
a
considerable
sum
of
money
from
their
host
by
superior
play
and
they
answered
her
quoting
a
proverb
that
nights
all
cats
are
grey
and
all
beards
too
and
seemed
to
consider
this
very
much
to
the
point
was
greatly
relieved
by
these
assurances
on
the
evening
before
the
company
dispersed
again
sought
a
private
interview
and
pressed
his
suit
she
accepted
him
without
further
ado
and
as
soon
as
they
returned
to
town
the
marriage
was
concluded
they
had
been
married
little
more
than
a
month
when
came
to
his
wife
one
morning
and
told
her
that
letters
of
importance
had
arrived
for
him
he
must
take
a
journey
into
the
country
and
be
away
six
weeks
at
least
on
a
matter
of
business
he
desired
her
to
divert
herself
in
his
absence
by
sending
for
her
friends
to
carry
them
off
to
the
country
if
she
pleased
and
to
make
good
cheer
wherever
she
was
said
he
the
keys
of
the
two
great
where
i
keep
my
spare
furniture
these
open
the
of
my
gold
and
silver
plate
which
is
only
used
on
state
occasions
these
unlock
my
chests
of
money
both
gold
and
silver
these
my
jewel
coffers
and
this
is
the
to
all
my
apartments
but
this
little
one
here
is
the
key
of
the
closet
at
the
end
of
the
great
gallery
on
the
ground
floor
open
all
the
others
go
where
you
will
but
into
that
little
closet
i
forbid
you
to
go
and
i
forbid
it
so
strongly
that
if
you
disobey
me
and
open
it
there
is
nothing
you
may
not
expect
from
my
displeasure
promised
to
obey
all
his
orders
exactly
whereupon
he
embraced
her
got
into
his
coach
and
was
driven
off
her
good
friends
and
neighbours
scarcely
waited
for
the
young
invitation
so
impatient
were
they
to
view
all
the
riches
of
her
grand
house
having
never
dared
to
come
while
her
husband
was
at
home
because
of
his
terrifying
blue
beard
they
overran
the
house
without
loss
of
time
hunting
their
curiosity
from
room
to
room
along
the
corridors
and
in
and
out
of
closets
and
wardrobes
cabinets
and
presses
opening
cupboards
ferreting
in
drawers
and
still
exclaiming
over
their
contents
as
each
new
discovery
proved
more
wonderful
than
the
last
they
roamed
through
the
bedrooms
and
spent
a
long
while
in
the
two
great
where
they
could
not
sufficiently
admire
the
number
and
beauty
of
the
tapestries
beds
sofas
consoles
stands
tables
but
particularly
the
in
which
you
could
see
yourself
from
head
to
foot
with
their
frames
of
glass
and
silver
and
the
finest
and
costliest
ever
seen
they
ceased
not
to
extol
and
to
envy
their
friend
good
fortune
my
husband
could
only
give
me
such
a
house
as
this
said
one
to
another
aught
i
cared
he
might
have
a
beard
of
all
the
colours
of
the
rainbow
illustration
they
overran
the
house
without
loss
of
time
meanwhile
was
not
in
the
least
amused
by
the
sight
of
all
these
riches
being
consumed
by
a
curiosity
even
more
ardent
than
that
of
her
friends
indeed
she
could
scarcely
contain
herself
and
listen
to
their
chatter
so
impatient
she
felt
to
go
and
open
the
closet
downstairs
if
only
had
not
forbidden
this
one
little
thing
or
if
having
reasons
of
his
own
to
keep
it
secret
he
had
been
content
to
take
the
key
away
with
him
saying
nothing
about
it
at
least
if
he
wished
to
prove
whether
or
not
poor
could
rise
above
the
common
frailty
of
her
sex
and
he
was
as
we
shall
see
a
somewhat
exacting
husband
he
should
have
warned
her
as
it
was
her
curiosity
grew
and
possessed
her
until
at
length
without
even
considering
how
uncivil
it
was
to
leave
her
guests
she
escaped
from
them
and
ran
down
a
little
back
staircase
in
such
haste
that
twice
or
thrice
she
tripped
over
her
gown
and
came
near
breaking
her
neck
when
she
reached
the
door
of
the
closet
she
hesitated
for
a
moment
or
so
thinking
upon
her
husband
command
and
considering
what
ill
might
befall
her
if
she
disobeyed
it
while
he
uttered
it
his
look
had
been
extremely
stern
and
a
blue
beard
for
after
a
month
of
married
life
she
could
no
longer
disguise
from
herself
that
it
was
still
blue
or
at
any
rate
changing
colour
less
rapidly
than
she
or
her
mother
had
promised
themselves
might
betoken
a
harsh
temper
on
the
other
hand
and
though
she
continued
to
find
it
repulsive
he
had
hitherto
proved
himself
a
kind
even
an
indulgent
husband
and
for
the
life
of
her
she
could
not
imagine
there
was
anything
unpardonable
in
opening
so
small
a
chamber
the
temptation
in
short
was
too
strong
for
her
to
overcome
she
took
the
little
key
and
trembling
opened
the
door
at
first
shading
her
eyes
and
peering
in
she
could
see
nothing
because
the
were
closed
but
after
some
moments
she
began
to
perceive
that
the
light
falling
through
the
shutters
took
a
reddish
tinge
as
it
touched
the
floor
so
red
it
was
or
rather
that
for
a
moment
or
two
she
supposed
the
closet
to
be
paved
with
porphyry
of
that
colour
still
as
she
stared
and
her
eyes
by
degrees
grew
accustomed
to
the
gloom
she
saw
and
moment
by
moment
the
truth
crept
upon
her
and
froze
her
that
the
floor
was
all
covered
with
clotted
blood
in
the
dull
shine
of
it
something
horrible
was
reflected
with
an
effort
she
lifted
her
eyes
to
the
wall
facing
her
and
there
in
a
row
on
seven
iron
clamps
hung
the
bodies
of
seven
dead
women
with
their
feet
dangling
a
few
inches
above
the
horrible
pool
in
which
their
blood
had
mingled
little
doubt
but
these
were
the
wives
whom
had
married
and
whose
throats
he
had
cut
one
after
another
poor
thought
to
die
of
fear
and
the
key
which
she
had
pulled
from
the
lock
fell
from
her
hand
when
she
had
regained
her
senses
a
little
she
picked
it
up
and
locked
the
door
again
but
her
hand
shook
so
that
this
was
no
easy
feat
and
she
tottered
upstairs
to
recover
herself
in
her
own
room
but
she
found
it
filled
with
her
officious
friends
who
being
occupied
with
envy
of
her
riches
and
having
no
reason
to
guess
that
in
a
husband
absence
anything
could
afflict
so
fortunate
a
wife
either
honestly
ignored
her
pallor
or
hoped
while
promising
to
come
again
that
they
had
not
overtired
her
by
their
visit
they
promised
too
to
repeat
their
call
very
soon
at
the
same
time
inquiring
how
long
her
husband
journey
might
be
expected
to
last
it
was
plain
that
they
feared
him
one
and
all
half
an
hour
ago
she
might
have
wondered
at
this
they
were
gone
at
last
drawing
the
key
from
her
pocket
now
to
her
horror
observed
a
dull
smear
upon
it
and
remembered
that
it
had
fallen
at
her
feet
on
the
edge
of
the
pool
of
blood
in
the
closet
she
wiped
it
she
rubbed
it
on
the
sleeve
of
her
robe
but
the
blood
would
not
come
off
in
a
sudden
terror
she
ran
to
her
poured
out
water
and
began
to
soap
the
key
but
in
vain
did
she
wash
it
and
even
scrape
it
with
a
knife
and
scrub
it
with
sand
and
the
blood
still
remained
for
the
key
was
a
magic
key
and
there
was
no
means
of
making
it
quite
clean
as
fast
as
the
blood
was
scoured
off
one
side
it
came
again
on
the
other
she
was
still
scouring
and
polishing
when
a
horn
sounded
not
very
far
away
in
her
flurry
she
paid
little
heed
to
this
or
to
the
rumble
of
wheels
she
heard
approaching
frightened
though
she
was
she
supposed
that
she
had
still
almost
six
weeks
in
which
to
restore
by
some
means
the
key
to
its
brightness
but
when
the
wheels
rolled
up
to
the
porchway
and
came
to
a
stop
and
when
the
horn
sounding
again
blew
her
husband
flourish
then
indeed
the
poor
lady
knees
knocked
together
and
almost
sank
beneath
her
hiding
the
key
in
the
bosom
of
her
bodice
she
tottered
forth
to
the
head
of
the
stairs
to
behold
himself
standing
beneath
the
lamp
in
the
hall
below
he
caught
sight
of
her
as
she
leaned
over
clinging
to
the
balustrade
and
called
up
cheerfully
that
he
had
received
letters
on
the
road
with
news
that
his
journey
was
after
all
unnecessary
the
business
he
went
about
had
been
settled
and
to
his
advantage
still
shaking
in
every
limb
crept
downstairs
to
give
him
greeting
she
ordered
supper
to
be
prepared
in
haste
and
while
he
ate
forced
herself
to
ask
a
hundred
questions
concerning
his
adventures
in
short
she
did
all
she
could
to
give
him
proof
that
she
was
delighted
at
his
speedy
return
next
morning
having
summoned
her
to
attend
him
on
the
terrace
he
asked
her
to
render
back
the
keys
which
she
gave
him
but
with
such
a
trembling
hand
that
he
easily
guessed
what
had
happened
is
this
he
is
not
the
key
of
my
closet
among
the
rest
must
have
left
it
upstairs
on
my
table
said
it
to
me
at
once
said
once
and
without
fail
she
went
and
after
a
while
returned
protesting
that
she
could
not
find
it
back
and
seek
again
commanded
dangerously
calm
after
going
backwards
and
forwards
several
times
she
could
pretend
no
longer
but
brought
him
the
key
examined
it
closely
and
demanded
came
this
blood
upon
the
key
do
not
know
answered
poor
paler
than
death
do
not
know
cried
in
a
terrible
voice
i
know
well
enough
you
have
chosen
to
enter
that
closet
mighty
well
madam
since
that
poor
room
of
mine
so
appeals
to
your
fancy
your
whim
shall
not
be
denied
you
go
in
and
take
your
place
among
the
ladies
you
saw
there
flung
herself
at
her
husband
feet
and
wept
and
begged
his
pardon
with
every
sign
of
truly
repenting
her
disobedience
she
would
have
melted
a
rock
so
beautiful
and
sorrowful
she
was
but
had
a
heart
harder
than
any
rock
illustration
the
unhappy
fatima
cried
up
to
her
sister
anne
do
you
see
any
one
coming
must
die
madam
said
he
that
presently
i
must
die
she
answered
looking
up
at
him
with
eyes
all
bathed
in
tears
me
a
little
time
to
say
my
prayers
grant
you
replied
minutes
and
not
a
second
more
as
she
went
from
him
and
through
the
house
towards
her
own
apartment
at
the
foot
of
the
great
staircase
she
met
with
her
sister
who
unaware
of
return
had
just
arrived
to
pay
her
a
visit
dear
sister
cried
embracing
her
tell
me
oh
and
for
heaven
sake
quickly
where
are
my
brothers
and
who
promised
to
come
with
you
are
at
home
said
were
detained
at
parade
and
i
have
come
ahead
of
them
i
could
wait
for
them
no
longer
in
my
impatience
to
see
you
but
just
as
i
was
starting
they
arrived
back
from
the
and
sent
word
that
they
will
follow
as
soon
as
they
have
groomed
their
horses
and
spend
a
happy
day
with
you
sobbed
will
never
see
me
alive
in
this
world
what
has
happened
her
sister
amazed
has
returned
yes
and
in
a
few
minutes
he
has
promised
to
kill
me
but
ah
ask
me
no
questions
there
is
so
little
time
left
dear
sister
if
you
love
me
run
upstairs
and
still
up
to
the
top
of
the
tower
look
if
my
brothers
are
not
coming
and
if
you
see
them
give
them
a
signal
to
make
haste
her
sister
left
her
and
ran
up
up
to
the
roof
of
the
tower
and
from
time
to
time
as
the
minutes
sped
the
unhappy
cried
up
to
her
sister
anne
do
you
see
any
one
coming
and
answered
her
see
nothing
but
the
noon
dust
and
the
green
grass
by
and
by
who
had
pulled
out
his
huge
sabre
and
was
trying
its
edge
on
the
short
turf
of
the
terrace
shouted
to
her
your
time
is
up
come
down
and
at
once
then
as
she
made
no
answer
he
shouted
again
and
as
loudly
as
he
could
bawl
down
quickly
or
i
will
come
up
to
you
moment
give
me
a
moment
longer
she
answered
and
called
softly
to
her
sister
sister
anne
do
you
see
any
one
coming
and
answered
see
nothing
but
the
noon
dust
and
the
green
grass
down
quickly
shouted
i
will
come
up
to
you
am
coming
answered
his
wife
and
again
she
cried
sister
anne
do
you
see
any
one
coming
see
answered
a
great
cloud
of
dust
coming
it
my
brothers
no
sister
i
see
a
flock
of
sheep
you
not
come
down
bawled
one
moment
longer
entreated
his
wife
and
once
more
she
called
out
sister
anne
do
you
see
nobody
coming
see
she
answered
two
knights
but
they
are
yet
a
great
way
off
god
be
praised
she
cried
a
moment
after
are
our
brothers
i
am
waving
my
handkerchief
to
them
to
hasten
then
stamped
his
foot
and
roared
out
so
terribly
that
he
made
the
whole
house
tremble
the
poor
lady
came
down
and
casting
herself
all
in
tears
and
dishevelled
at
his
feet
clasped
him
by
the
ankles
while
she
besought
him
for
mercy
shall
not
help
you
said
must
die
then
taking
hold
of
her
hair
and
twisting
her
head
back
the
better
to
expose
her
beautiful
throat
he
exclaimed
be
the
lesson
i
read
against
curiosity
the
peculiar
vice
of
womankind
and
which
above
all
others
i
find
detestable
to
that
most
fatal
habit
all
the
best
accredited
religions
in
whatever
else
they
may
differ
unite
in
attributing
the
first
cause
of
all
misfortunes
to
which
the
race
is
subject
in
this
strain
he
continued
for
fully
three
minutes
still
grasping
her
hair
with
one
hand
while
with
the
other
he
flourished
his
sabre
as
he
ceased
poor
looked
up
at
him
with
dying
eyes
sir
she
besought
him
if
this
curiosity
be
as
you
remind
me
my
worst
sin
you
will
not
be
so
cruel
as
to
destroy
me
before
i
have
confessed
and
asked
pardon
for
it
grant
me
then
just
one
moment
more
to
fix
my
thoughts
on
devotion
illustration
then
blue
beard
roared
out
so
terribly
that
he
made
the
whole
house
tremble
no
was
his
answer
thyself
to
heaven
and
he
swung
up
his
sabre
to
strike
at
that
very
instant
there
sounded
so
loud
a
knocking
at
the
gate
that
he
came
to
a
sudden
stop
his
arm
dropped
as
the
gate
flew
open
and
two
cavaliers
ran
in
with
drawn
swords
and
rushed
upon
him
loosing
his
hold
upon
who
sank
fainting
upon
the
grass
he
ran
to
save
himself
but
the
two
brothers
were
so
hot
on
his
heels
that
after
pursuing
him
through
the
vineries
and
the
they
overtook
him
just
as
he
reached
the
steps
of
the
main
porch
there
they
ran
their
swords
through
his
body
and
after
making
sure
that
he
was
dead
returned
to
their
sister
who
opened
her
eyes
indeed
as
they
bent
over
her
but
had
not
strength
enough
to
rise
and
embrace
them
had
no
heirs
and
so
his
wife
became
mistress
of
all
his
estates
she
employed
a
part
of
her
wealth
to
marry
her
sister
to
a
young
gentleman
who
had
loved
her
a
long
while
another
part
to
purchase
captains
commissions
for
her
two
and
the
rest
to
marry
herself
to
a
very
worthy
gentleman
who
made
her
forget
the
short
but
unhappy
time
she
had
passed
with
moral
for
curious
wives
should
have
one
lord
only
some
have
curiosity
t
enjoy
a
scripture
says
we
may
not
serve
two
masters
little
keys
have
opened

another
for
chastising
or
correcting
husbands
very
best
sermon
that
ever
was
a
thought
less
effective
the
longer
it
cinderella
or
the
little
glass
slipper
once
upon
a
time
there
lived
a
gentleman
who
married
twice
his
second
wife
was
a
widow
with
two
daughters
both
somewhat
past
their
prime
and
this
woman
would
have
been
the
proudest
and
most
overbearing
in
the
world
had
not
her
daughters
exactly
resembled
her
with
their
fine
airs
and
insolent
tempers
the
husband
too
had
by
his
first
wife
a
child
of
his
own
a
young
daughter
and
so
good
and
so
gentle
that
she
promised
to
grow
up
into
the
living
image
of
her
dead
mother
who
had
been
the
most
lovable
of
women
the
wedding
festivities
were
no
sooner
over
than
the
stepmother
began
to
show
herself
in
her
true
colours
she
could
not
endure
the
good
qualities
which
by
contrast
rendered
her
own
daughters
the
more
odious
she
put
her
to
drudge
at
the
meanest
household
work
and
thus
she
and
her
precious
darlings
not
only
wreaked
their
spite
but
saved
money
to
buy
themselves
dresses
and
finery
it
was
the
child
who
scoured
the
pots
and
pans
scrubbed
the
floors
washed
down
the
stairs
polished
the
tables
ironed
the
linen
darned
the
stockings
and
made
the
beds
she
herself
slept
at
the
top
of
the
house
in
a
garret
upon
a
wretched
straw
mattress
while
her
sisters
had
apartments
of
their
own
with
inlaid
floors
beds
carved
and
gilded
in
the
latest
fashion
and
mirrors
in
which
they
could
see
themselves
from
head
to
foot
yet
they
were
so
helpless
or
rather
they
thought
it
so
menial
to
do
anything
for
themselves
that
had
they
but
a
ribbon
to
tie
or
a
bow
to
adjust
or
a
bodice
to
be
laced
the
child
must
be
sent
for
when
she
came
it
was
odds
that
they
met
her
with
a
storm
of
abuse
in
this
fashion
do
you
mean
pray
by
answering
the
bell
in
this
state
stand
before
the
glass
and
look
at
yourself
look
at
your
hands
faugh
how
can
you
suppose
we
should
allow
you
to
touch
a
ribbon
or
even
come
near
us
with
such
hands
run
downstairs
slut
and
put
yourself
under
the
kitchen
pump
and
so
on
can
i
help
it
thought
the
poor
little
drudge
i
do
not
run
at
once
when
the
bell
rings
they
scold
me
for
that
yet
they
ring
both
of
them
together
sometimes
a
minute
after
setting
me
to
rake
out
a
grate
and
sift
the
ashes
as
for
looking
at
myself
in
the
glass
gladly
would
i
do
it
if
they
allowed
me
one
but
they
have
told
me
that
if
i
had
a
glass
i
should
only
waste
time
in
front
of
it
she
kept
these
thoughts
to
herself
however
and
suffered
her
patiently
not
daring
to
complain
to
her
father
who
would
moreover
have
joined
with
the
others
in
chiding
her
for
he
was
wholly
under
his
wife
thumb
and
she
had
enough
of
chiding
already
when
she
had
done
her
work
she
used
to
creep
away
to
the
and
seat
herself
among
the
cinders
and
from
this
the
household
name
for
her
came
to
be
but
the
younger
sister
who
was
not
so
as
the
elder
called
her
they
were
wise
in
their
way
to
deprive
her
of
a
for
in
truth
and
in
spite
of
her
sorry
rags
was
a
hundred
times
more
beautiful
than
they
with
all
their
magnificent
dresses
it
happened
that
the
king
son
gave
a
ball
and
sent
invitations
through
the
kingdom
to
every
person
of
quality
our
two
misses
were
invited
among
the
rest
for
they
cut
a
great
figure
in
that
part
of
the
country
mightily
pleased
they
were
to
be
sure
with
their
cards
of
invitation
all
printed
in
gold
and
stamped
with
the
broad
red
seal
of
the
heir
apparent
and
mightily
busy
they
were
discussing
what
gowns
and
would
best
become
them
this
meant
more
worry
for
for
it
was
she
who
ironed
her
sisters
linen
goffered
their
tucks
and
frills
pleated
their
wristbands
pressed
their
trimmings
of
old
lace
and
wrapped
them
away
in
tissue
paper
a
score
of
times
all
this
lace
piece
by
piece
had
to
be
unwrapped
inspected
put
away
again
and
after
a
all
the
linen
had
to
be
ironed
goffered
crimped
or
pleated
afresh
for
them
they
could
talk
of
nothing
but
their
ball
dresses
illustration
she
used
to
creep
away
to
the
and
seat
herself
among
the
cinders
my
part
said
the
elder
shall
wear
a
velvet
cramoisie
trimmed
for
she
had
a
passion
for
cramoisie
and
could
not
perceive
how
ill
the
colour
went
with
her
complexion
had
thought
of
but
there
the
cost
of
the
underskirt
to
be
considered
and
underskirts
seem
to
grow
dearer
and
dearer
in
these
days
what
a
relief
she
went
on
must
be
to
have
money
and
not
be
forced
to
set
one
thing
against
another
said
the
younger
make
shift
with
my
old
underskirt
that
is
unless
i
can
wheedle
some
money
out
of
papa
for
so
in
their
affection
they
called
their
stepfather
can
take
out
the
worst
stains
with
a
little
i
believe
that
if
she
tries
she
can
make
it
look
as
good
as
new
and
at
all
events
it
will
give
her
something
to
do
instead
of
wasting
an
afternoon
i
do
pretend
that
i
wearing
an
old
underskirt
and
i
hope
to
make
dear
papa
sensible
of
this
but
against
it
i
shall
have
the
robe
on
which
i
am
determined
and
my
diamond
stomacher
which
is
somewhat
better
than
the
common
i
of
course
said
the
elder
wear
my
diamond
spray
if
only
it
had
a
ruby
in
the
clasp
instead
of
a
sapphire
rubies
go
so
much
better
with
cramoisie
i
suppose
there
is
no
time
now
to
ask
the
jeweller
to
it
with
a
ruby
you
do
possess
a
ruby
dear
murmured
her
sister
who
did
possess
one
and
had
no
intention
of
lending
it
besides
sapphires
suit
you
so
much
better
they
sent
for
the
best
milliner
they
could
find
to
build
their
in
triple
tiers
and
for
the
best
hairdresser
to
arrange
their
hair
and
their
patches
were
supplied
by
the
shop
to
which
all
the
quality
went
from
time
to
time
they
called
up
to
ask
her
advice
for
she
had
excellent
taste
advised
them
perfectly
and
even
offered
her
services
to
dress
their
hair
for
them
on
the
night
of
the
ball
they
accepted
gladly
enough
whilst
she
was
dressing
them
one
asked
her
would
you
not
like
to
be
going
to
the
ball
miss
said
are
making
fun
of
me
it
is
not
for
the
like
of
me
to
be
there
are
right
girl
folks
would
laugh
indeed
to
see
at
a
ball
any
one
but
would
have
pinned
on
their
awry
and
if
you
or
i
had
been
in
her
place
i
wo
swear
but
that
we
might
have
pushed
in
the
pins
just
a
trifle
carelessly
but
she
had
no
malice
in
her
nature
she
attired
them
to
perfection
though
they
found
fault
with
her
all
the
while
it
was
doing
and
quite
forgot
to
thank
her
when
it
was
done
let
it
be
related
in
excuse
for
their
tempers
that
they
had
passed
almost
two
days
without
eating
so
eager
were
they
and
excited
the
most
of
this
time
they
had
spent
in
front
of
their
mirrors
where
they
had
broken
more
than
a
dozen
laces
in
trying
to
squeeze
their
waists
and
make
them
appear
more
slender
they
were
dressed
a
full
two
hours
before
the
time
fixed
for
starting
but
at
length
the
coach
arrived
at
the
door
they
were
tucked
into
it
with
a
hundred
precautions
and
followed
it
with
her
eyes
as
long
as
she
could
that
is
to
say
until
the
tears
rose
and
blinded
them
she
turned
away
weeping
back
to
the
house
and
crept
into
her
dear
where
being
all
alone
in
the
kitchen
she
could
indulge
her
misery
a
long
while
she
sat
there
suddenly
between
two
heavy
sobs
she
looked
up
her
eyes
attracted
by
a
strange
blue
glow
on
the
far
side
of
the
hearth
and
there
stood
the
queerest
lady
who
must
have
entered
somehow
without
knocking
her
powdered
hair
was
dressed
all
about
her
head
in
the
prettiest
of
short
curls
amid
which
the
most
exquisite
jewels
diamonds
and
rubies
and
emeralds
sparkled
against
the
firelight
her
dress
had
wide
panniers
bulging
over
a
skirt
of
lace
flounces
billowy
and
delicate
as
and
a
stiff
bodice
shaped
to
the
narrowest
waist
imaginable
jewels
flashed
all
over
this
dress
or
at
least
supposed
them
to
be
jewels
though
on
second
thoughts
they
might
be
fireflies
butterflies
glowworms
they
seemed
at
any
rate
to
be
alive
and
to
dart
from
one
point
to
another
of
her
attire
lastly
this
strange
lady
held
in
her
right
hand
a
short
wand
on
the
end
of
which
trembled
a
pale
flame
and
it
was
this
which
had
first
caught
eye
and
caused
her
to
look
up
evening
child
said
the
visitor
in
a
sharp
clear
voice
at
the
same
time
nodding
kindly
across
the
firelight
seem
to
be
in
trouble
what
is
the
matter
wish
sobbed
wish
she
began
again
and
again
she
choked
this
was
all
she
could
say
for
weeping
wish
dear
that
you
could
go
to
the
ball
is
it
not
so
yes
said
with
a
sigh
then
said
the
visitor
a
good
girl
dry
your
tears
and
i
think
it
can
be
managed
i
am
your
godmother
you
must
know
and
in
younger
days
your
mother
and
i
were
very
dear
friends
she
omitted
perhaps
purposely
to
add
that
she
was
a
fairy
but
was
soon
to
discover
this
too
you
happen
to
have
any
pumpkins
in
the
garden
her
godmother
asked
thought
this
an
odd
question
she
could
not
imagine
what
pumpkins
had
to
do
with
going
to
a
ball
but
she
answered
that
there
were
plenty
in
the
garden
a
whole
bed
of
them
in
fact
let
us
go
out
and
have
a
look
at
them
they
went
out
into
the
dark
garden
to
the
pumpkin
patch
and
her
godmother
pointed
to
the
finest
of
all
with
her
wand
that
one
she
commanded
picked
it
still
wondering
her
godmother
opened
a
fruit
knife
that
had
a
handle
of
with
this
she
scooped
out
the
inside
of
the
fruit
till
only
the
rind
was
left
then
she
tapped
it
with
her
wand
and
at
once
the
pumpkin
was
changed
into
a
beautiful
coach
all
covered
with
gold
we
must
have
horses
said
her
godmother
question
is
have
you
such
a
thing
as
a
mouse
trap
in
the
house
ran
to
look
into
her
mouse
trap
where
she
found
six
mice
all
alive
her
godmother
following
told
her
to
lift
the
door
of
the
trap
a
little
way
and
as
the
mice
ran
out
one
by
one
she
gave
each
a
tap
with
her
wand
and
each
mouse
turned
at
once
into
a
beautiful
horse
which
made
a
fine
team
of
six
horses
of
a
lovely
grey
dappled
with
mouse
colour
now
the
trouble
was
to
find
a
coachman
will
go
and
see
said
who
had
dried
her
tears
and
was
beginning
to
find
this
great
fun
there
is
such
a
thing
as
a
rat
in
the
rat
trap
we
can
make
a
coachman
of
him
are
right
dear
said
her
godmother
and
look
fetched
her
the
rat
trap
there
were
three
large
rats
in
it
the
fairy
chose
one
of
the
three
because
of
his
enormous
whiskers
and
at
a
touch
he
was
changed
into
a
fat
coachman
next
she
said
to
the
end
of
the
garden
and
there
in
the
corner
of
the
wall
behind
the
unless
i
am
mistaken
you
will
find
six
lizards
bring
them
to
me
had
no
sooner
brought
them
than
her
godmother
changed
them
into
six
footmen
who
climbed
up
at
once
behind
the
coach
with
their
bedizened
liveries
and
clung
on
as
though
they
had
been
doing
nothing
else
all
their
lives
the
fairy
then
said
to
now
child
this
will
do
to
go
to
the
ball
with
unless
you
are
hard
to
please
yes
answered
how
can
i
go
as
i
am
in
these
horrid
clothes
might
have
given
me
credit
for
thinking
of
that
too
her
godmother
did
but
touch
her
with
her
wand
and
on
the
instant
her
rags
were
transformed
into
cloth
of
gold
and
silver
all
bespangled
with
precious
stones
she
felt
her
hair
creeping
up
into
curls
and
tiring
and
arranging
itself
in
tiers
on
the
topmost
of
which
a
double
ostrich
feather
grew
from
a
diamond
clasp
that
caught
the
rays
of
the
old
lady
wand
and
shot
them
about
the
garden
this
way
and
that
making
the
slugs
and
snails
crawl
to
shelter
the
chief
mark
of
a
lady
said
her
godmother
eyeing
her
with
approval
to
be
well
shod
and
so
saying
she
pulled
out
a
pair
of
glass
slippers
into
which
poked
her
toes
doubtfully
for
glass
is
not
as
a
rule
an
accommodating
material
for
slippers
you
have
to
be
measured
very
carefully
for
it
but
these
fitted
to
perfection
and
thus
arrayed
from
top
to
toe
had
nothing
more
to
do
but
kiss
her
godmother
thank
her
and
step
into
the
coach
the
six
horses
of
which
were
pawing
the
cabbage
beds
impatiently
child
her
godmother
of
one
thing
i
must
warn
you
seriously
i
have
power
to
send
you
thus
to
the
ball
but
my
power
lasts
only
until
midnight
not
an
instant
beyond
midnight
must
you
stay
there
if
you
the
stroke
of
twelve
your
coach
will
become
but
a
pumpkin
again
your
horses
will
change
back
into
mice
your
footmen
into
lizards
and
your
ball
dress
shrink
to
the
same
rags
in
which
i
found
you
promised
that
she
would
not
fail
to
take
her
departure
before
midnight
and
with
that
the
coachman
cracked
his
whip
and
she
was
driven
away
beside
herself
with
joy
in
the
royal
palace
and
in
the
royal
gardens
over
which
shone
the
same
stars
which
had
looked
down
upon
pumpkins
the
ball
was
at
its
height
with
scores
and
scores
of
couples
dancing
on
the
waxed
floor
to
the
music
of
the
violins
and
under
the
trees
where
the
music
throbbed
in
faint
echoes
other
scores
of
couples
moving
passing
and
repassing
listening
to
the
plash
of
the
fountains
and
inhaling
the
sweet
scent
of
the
flowers
now
as
the
king
son
walked
among
his
guests
word
was
brought
to
him
by
his
chamberlain
that
a
grand
princess
whom
nobody
knew
had
just
arrived
and
desired
admission
will
not
tell
her
name
said
the
chamberlain
that
she
is
a
princess
and
of
very
high
dignity
can
not
be
doubted
apart
from
her
beauty
and
the
perfection
of
her
address
of
which
your
royal
highness
perhaps
will
allow
me
to
be
no
mean
judge
i
may
mention
that
the
very
jewels
in
her
hair
are
worth
a
whole
province
the
king
son
hastened
to
the
gate
to
receive
the
fair
stranger
handed
her
down
from
the
coach
and
led
her
through
the
gardens
where
the
guests
drew
apart
and
gazed
in
wonder
at
her
loveliness
still
escorted
by
him
she
entered
the
where
at
once
a
great
silence
fell
the
dancing
was
broken
off
the
violins
ceased
to
play
so
taken
so
ravished
was
everybody
by
the
vision
of
this
unknown
one
everywhere
ran
the
murmur
how
beautiful
she
is
the
himself
old
as
he
was
could
not
take
his
eyes
off
her
and
confided
to
the
in
a
low
voice
that
it
was
long
since
he
had
seen
so
adorable
a
creature
all
the
ladies
were
busily
studying
her
and
her
ball
gown
that
they
might
order
the
like
next
day
for
themselves
if
only
vain
hope
they
could
find
materials
so
exquisite
and
dressmakers
clever
enough
the
king
son
took
her
to
the
place
of
honour
and
afterwards
led
her
out
to
dance
she
danced
so
gracefully
that
all
admired
her
yet
the
more
a
splendid
supper
was
served
but
the
young
ate
nothing
of
it
so
intent
was
he
on
gazing
upon
her
she
went
and
sat
by
her
sisters
who
bridled
with
pleasure
at
the
honour
she
did
them
a
thousand
civilities
sharing
with
them
the
nectarines
and
citrons
which
the
brought
her
and
still
not
recognising
her
they
marvelled
at
this
being
quite
unused
as
they
never
deserved
to
be
selected
for
attentions
so
flattering
the
king
son
now
claimed
her
for
another
dance
it
had
scarcely
come
to
an
end
when
heard
the
clock
strike
the
quarter
to
twelve
whereupon
she
instantly
desired
her
partner
to
lead
her
to
the
and
i
must
be
going
she
said
is
cruel
of
you
to
go
so
early
he
protested
at
least
you
will
come
again
and
grant
me
many
dances
there
to
be
another
ball
then
she
asked
yes
and
as
many
morrows
as
you
wish
if
only
you
will
come
if
i
could
to
herself
for
she
was
young
and
it
seemed
to
her
that
she
could
never
have
enough
of
such
evenings
as
this
though
they
went
on
for
ever
and
ever
the
led
her
to
the
daïs
where
sat
the
and
she
made
a
deep
reverence
before
them
a
slighter
but
no
less
gracious
one
to
the
company
and
withdrew
although
she
had
given
no
orders
her
coach
stood
waiting
for
her
slipping
in
she
was
whisked
home
in
the
time
it
would
take
you
to
wink
an
eye
she
had
scarcely
entered
the
house
however
before
she
received
a
shock
for
on
the
threshold
of
the
kitchen
glancing
down
to
make
sure
that
her
ball
gown
was
not
disarranged
by
this
rapid
journey
she
perceived
that
it
had
vanished
changed
back
to
the
rags
of
her
daily
wear
but
there
in
the
light
of
the
hearth
stood
her
godmother
who
smiled
so
pleasantly
that
choked
down
her
little
cry
of
disappointment
illustration
whereupon
she
instantly
desired
her
partner
to
lead
her
to
the
king
and
queen
child
and
how
have
you
fared
i
have
never
been
so
happy
in
all
my
life
and
it
is
all
thanks
to
you
but
after
thanking
her
could
not
help
confessing
how
she
longed
to
go
to
the
ball
next
evening
the
son
had
begged
her
to
come
again
and
oh
if
she
had
been
able
to
promise
to
that
child
said
her
godmother
will
see
about
it
when
the
time
comes
but
it
has
been
lonely
keeping
watch
and
sitting
up
for
you
will
you
not
reward
me
by
telling
all
about
it
needed
no
such
invitation
she
was
dying
to
relate
her
adventures
she
talked
and
talked
her
godmother
still
smiling
and
questioning
for
two
hours
may
be
she
talked
and
was
still
recollecting
a
score
of
things
to
tell
when
her
sisters
coach
rumbled
up
to
the
gate
and
almost
at
once
there
came
a
loud
ring
at
the
bell
she
stared
and
rubbed
her
eyes
for
at
the
first
sound
of
it
her
godmother
had
vanished
ran
and
opened
the
door
to
her
sisters
a
long
time
you
have
stayed
said
she
yawning
rubbing
her
eyes
and
stretching
herself
as
though
she
had
just
waked
out
of
sleep
she
had
felt
however
no
inclination
at
all
to
sleep
since
their
departure
you
had
been
at
the
ball
said
the
elder
sister
would
not
have
felt
tired
one
of
the
guests
was
the
loveliest
princess
oh
the
loveliest
you
ever
could
see
she
showed
us
a
thousand
civilities
she
gave
us
nectarines
and
citrons
contained
her
joy
upstairs
while
she
unplaited
her
sisters
hair
and
unlaced
their
bodices
she
asked
the
name
of
the
princess
but
they
answered
that
no
one
knew
her
that
the
king
son
was
wild
about
her
and
would
give
everything
in
the
world
to
discover
who
she
was
smiled
she
no
longer
felt
any
temptation
at
all
to
be
clumsy
with
the
hairpins
then
she
said
must
be
beautiful
indeed
and
she
went
away
you
say
without
telling
her
name
is
no
one
going
to
see
her
again
for
that
she
may
come
again
to
the
ball
i
am
told
that
the
begged
it
almost
with
tears
in
his
eyes
for
there
is
to
be
another
ball
and
we
are
going
heavens
sighed
how
lucky
you
are
might
i
not
just
see
her
please
please
sister
caroline
take
me
i
could
manage
quite
well
if
only
you
lent
me
your
yellow
gown
which
you
wear
every
evening
can
not
be
awake
you
must
have
been
dreaming
to
some
purpose
if
you
see
me
lending
my
clothes
to
a
nasty
little
had
quite
well
expected
some
such
rebuff
and
was
glad
enough
to
get
it
for
it
would
have
been
very
awkward
if
her
sister
had
been
willing
to
lend
the
gown
the
next
evening
the
two
sisters
were
at
the
ball
and
so
was
but
in
even
finer
attire
than
before
her
godmother
had
spared
no
pains
and
as
for
the
expense
that
hardly
needs
to
be
considered
when
you
can
turn
pumpkins
into
gilt
coaches
cobwebs
into
valenciennes
lace
and
beetles
wings
into
rubies
with
the
tap
of
a
wand
the
king
son
in
his
impatience
flew
to
her
coach
door
as
soon
as
she
arrived
throughout
the
evening
he
never
left
her
side
nor
ceased
to
make
pretty
speeches
and
she
pretty
maid
was
far
from
finding
his
behaviour
tiresome
so
far
indeed
that
she
forgot
her
warning
the
end
was
that
in
the
midst
of
a
dance
she
heard
the
stroke
of
a
clock
looked
up
was
dismayed
to
find
it
the
first
stroke
of
twelve
when
she
believed
it
yet
an
hour
short
of
midnight
and
made
her
escape
as
lightly
as
a
deer
the
followed
but
could
not
catch
her
only
she
dropped
one
of
her
glass
slippers
which
he
picked
up
and
treasured
with
the
last
stroke
of
twelve
coach
and
footmen
had
whisked
away
and
poor
barefoot
now
as
well
as
in
rags
panted
homeward
over
roads
where
the
flints
cut
her
until
she
bled
and
the
owls
and
great
moths
blundered
out
of
the
bushes
against
her
face
to
make
matters
worse
a
thunderstorm
broke
before
she
had
ran
half
the
distance
and
she
arrived
home
in
a
terrible
plight
muddy
drenched
to
the
skin
and
almost
more
dead
than
alive
in
one
thing
only
she
was
fortunate
she
had
outstripped
her
sisters
whose
coach
on
the
way
home
lost
a
wheel
and
i
have
a
suspicion
that
godmother
had
something
to
do
with
this
misadventure
too
at
all
events
when
opened
the
kitchen
door
the
little
lady
stood
as
she
had
stood
the
night
before
in
the
glow
of
the
hearth
awaiting
her
child
she
said
frowning
yet
the
frown
was
not
altogether
unkindly
is
easily
seen
that
you
have
forgotten
my
warning
and
have
suffered
for
it
but
what
is
you
are
clutching
poor
drew
from
under
her
bedraggled
bodice
a
crystal
slipper
fellow
to
the
missing
one
it
was
the
one
remnant
of
all
her
finery
and
somehow
scarcely
knowing
why
she
had
hugged
it
to
her
while
she
ran
and
never
let
it
slip
in
all
her
stumblings
her
godmother
gazed
at
her
with
a
queer
expression
that
began
by
being
a
frown
yet
in
the
end
had
certainly
changed
into
a
shrewd
smile
have
been
careless
she
said
i
am
pleased
to
see
that
you
have
managed
to
keep
at
any
rate
of
your
godmother
gift
think
she
meant
by
this
that
whereas
all
the
rest
of
adornment
had
been
contrived
out
of
something
other
than
it
was
the
two
glass
slippers
had
been
really
produced
out
of
the
fairy
pocket
they
alone
had
not
vanished
at
the
stroke
of
midnight
what
has
become
of
the
other
one
her
godmother
asked
did
not
know
for
certain
but
fancied
that
she
must
have
dropped
it
in
her
hurry
to
escape
from
the
palace
you
are
careless
repeated
the
fairy
decidedly
you
are
not
unlucky
and
with
that
she
vanished
as
the
bell
sounded
announcing
the
they
were
not
in
the
best
of
humours
to
begin
with
asked
them
if
they
had
again
found
the
ball
enjoyable
and
if
the
beautiful
lady
had
been
there
they
told
her
yes
but
that
on
the
stroke
of
twelve
she
had
taken
flight
and
so
hurriedly
that
she
had
let
fall
one
of
her
small
glass
slippers
the
prettiest
in
the
world
which
the
king
son
had
picked
up
they
added
that
this
indeed
was
the
first
cause
of
their
delay
for
seeking
their
carriage
they
had
found
the
entry
blocked
and
the
in
the
wildest
state
of
mind
demanding
of
the
guards
if
they
had
not
seen
a
princess
pass
out
the
guards
answered
that
they
had
seen
no
one
pass
out
but
a
ragged
girl
who
looked
more
like
a
country
wench
than
a
princess
amid
this
the
sisters
had
with
difficulty
found
their
coach
and
then
within
two
miles
of
home
a
wheel
had
come
off
and
the
coach
had
lurched
over
in
a
thunderstorm
too
and
they
had
been
forced
to
walk
the
rest
of
the
way
the
one
with
a
bruised
shoulder
and
the
other
which
was
worse
with
a
twisted
ankle
but
after
all
the
dance
had
been
worth
these
mischances
and
sufferings
and
said
they
harking
back
the
was
undoubtedly
deep
in
love
for
they
had
left
him
gazing
fondly
at
the
slipper
and
little
doubt
mysteriously
as
she
chose
to
behave
he
would
make
every
effort
to
find
the
beautiful
creature
to
whom
it
belonged
they
told
the
truth
too
for
a
few
days
after
the
king
son
had
it
proclaimed
by
sound
of
trumpet
that
he
would
marry
her
whose
foot
the
slipper
exactly
fitted
at
first
they
tried
it
on
the
princesses
of
the
court
then
on
the
duchesses
then
on
the
marchionesses
then
on
the
countesses
and
viscountesses
then
on
the
baronesses
and
so
on
through
all
the
ladies
of
the
court
and
a
number
of
competitors
who
though
they
did
not
belong
to
it
yet
supposed
that
the
smallness
of
their
feet
was
an
argument
that
their
parents
had
very
unjustly
come
down
in
the
world
the
prime
minister
who
carried
the
glass
slipper
on
a
velvet
cushion
was
kept
very
busy
during
the
next
few
weeks
at
length
he
called
on
two
sisters
who
did
all
they
could
to
squeeze
a
foot
into
the
slipper
but
by
no
means
could
they
succeed
who
was
looking
on
and
admiring
their
efforts
said
laughingly
me
see
if
it
will
fit
me
her
sisters
began
to
laugh
and
mock
at
her
but
the
prime
minister
who
had
come
to
make
trial
of
the
slipper
looked
at
attentively
and
seeing
how
she
was
said
that
it
was
but
just
he
had
orders
to
try
it
upon
every
one
illustration
the
prime
minister
was
kept
very
busy
during
the
next
few
weeks
he
asked
to
sit
down
and
drawing
the
slipper
upon
her
little
foot
he
saw
that
it
went
on
easily
and
fitted
the
foot
like
wax
great
was
the
astonishment
of
the
two
sisters
but
it
was
greater
when
pulled
from
her
pocket
the
other
little
slipper
and
put
it
upon
the
other
foot
on
top
of
this
came
a
rap
at
the
door
and
in
walked
the
fairy
godmother
who
by
a
touch
of
her
wand
upon
clothes
made
them
still
more
magnificent
than
they
had
been
before
and
now
her
two
sisters
knew
to
be
the
same
beautiful
creature
they
had
seen
at
the
ball
they
threw
themselves
at
her
feet
begging
her
pardon
for
all
the
they
had
made
her
suffer
raised
and
kissed
them
saying
that
she
forgave
them
with
all
her
heart
and
entreated
them
to
be
loving
to
her
always
they
led
her
to
the
young
arrayed
as
she
was
he
thought
her
lovelier
than
ever
and
a
few
days
after
they
were
married
who
was
as
good
as
she
was
beautiful
lodged
her
two
sisters
in
the
palace
and
married
them
that
same
day
to
two
great
lords
of
the
court
moral
than
wealth
or
art
or
a
painted
face
is
when
a
natural
its
natural
beats
at
a
natural
another
youth
that
is
poor
of
purse
matter
how
witty
or
handsome
find
its
talents
no
a
godmamma
to
advance
beauty
and
the
beast
once
upon
a
time
in
a
country
a
long
way
from
here
there
stood
a
flourishing
city
full
of
commerce
and
in
that
city
lived
a
merchant
so
lucky
in
all
his
ventures
that
it
seemed
as
if
fortune
waited
on
his
wishes
but
while
enormously
rich
he
had
a
very
long
family
of
six
sons
and
six
daughters
and
as
yet
not
one
of
them
was
settled
in
life
the
boys
were
too
young
to
go
out
in
the
world
and
the
girls
who
had
everything
at
home
the
heart
could
desire
were
in
no
hurry
to
risk
a
change
by
choosing
a
husband
although
many
rich
and
noble
suitors
paid
court
to
them
but
one
day
an
unexpected
disaster
brought
this
pleasant
state
of
things
to
an
end
their
house
caught
fire
and
was
burnt
to
the
ground
and
with
it
perished
not
only
the
magnificent
furniture
but
the
merchant
account
books
bank
notes
gold
and
silver
and
the
precious
wares
on
which
his
wealth
depended
scarcely
anything
was
saved
this
was
but
the
beginning
of
their
misfortunes
their
father
who
up
to
now
had
prospered
in
everything
he
touched
lost
in
a
very
short
while
every
ship
he
had
upon
the
sea
some
were
wrecked
others
captured
by
pirates
his
agents
failed
his
clerks
in
foreign
countries
proved
unfaithful
and
in
short
from
the
height
of
riches
he
suddenly
fell
into
the
direst
poverty
nothing
was
left
to
him
but
one
poor
little
country
cottage
at
least
a
hundred
leagues
from
the
city
in
which
he
had
lived
in
this
he
was
driven
to
find
refuge
and
to
this
he
carried
off
his
family
who
were
in
despair
since
the
overthrow
the
daughters
especially
could
not
endure
the
thought
of
dwelling
in
such
a
den
as
they
called
it
at
first
they
had
felt
sure
that
on
hearing
the
news
their
suitors
would
be
tripping
one
another
up
in
haste
to
renew
their
offers
of
marriage
but
in
this
they
were
soon
undeceived
their
downfall
was
no
sooner
known
than
all
these
flattering
wooers
took
to
their
heels
in
a
troop
they
fared
no
better
with
their
intimate
friends
who
at
once
dropped
their
acquaintance
nay
those
to
whom
our
merchant
had
formerly
shown
the
greatest
kindness
were
now
the
most
eager
to
speak
ill
of
him
so
nothing
was
left
for
this
hapless
family
but
to
take
their
departure
from
the
city
and
shut
themselves
up
in
the
cottage
which
stood
in
the
depth
of
a
dismal
and
almost
trackless
forest
no
servants
now
to
wait
on
them
the
sons
tilled
the
ground
and
swept
out
the
farm
sheds
and
the
daughters
dressed
like
country
girls
in
coarse
linen
frocks
were
forced
to
turn
their
delicate
hands
to
the
roughest
employment
and
live
on
hard
fare
of
which
there
was
little
enough
only
the
youngest
daughter
showed
a
brave
heart
she
had
been
despondent
as
any
of
them
to
begin
with
but
after
weeping
as
well
she
might
for
her
father
misfortunes
she
recovered
her
natural
gaiety
made
the
best
of
things
tried
to
forget
how
ungrateful
the
world
had
been
kept
her
father
and
her
brothers
amused
with
her
cheerful
wit
and
after
she
had
done
her
work
would
sing
and
play
but
her
sisters
would
not
join
with
her
in
making
the
best
of
things
is
very
easy
for
you
to
be
happy
the
eldest
grumbled
have
low
tastes
and
were
born
for
this
kind
of
life
the
fact
is
they
were
all
jealous
of
her
because
of
her
sweet
temper
and
good
looks
so
beautiful
indeed
was
this
youngest
sister
that
in
the
old
days
every
one
had
agreed
to
call
her
by
that
and
by
no
other
name
she
was
known
alone
of
them
she
might
easily
in
the
first
days
of
their
ruin
have
found
a
husband
but
she
could
not
think
of
this
while
she
could
be
of
use
to
help
and
console
her
family
two
years
passed
and
there
came
news
which
seemed
to
offer
a
hope
to
escape
one
of
their
father
ships
long
supposed
to
be
lost
had
arrived
in
port
with
a
rich
cargo
the
message
further
advised
his
return
to
the
city
with
speed
or
his
agents
might
sell
the
goods
too
cheaply
and
he
would
lose
his
gains
so
whilst
his
children
danced
with
joy
at
the
news
the
merchant
set
about
preparing
for
his
long
journey
in
their
transport
his
daughters
loaded
him
with
commissions
for
gowns
and
jewels
it
would
have
taken
a
fortune
to
buy
only
would
not
ask
for
anything
her
father
noting
her
silence
interrupted
the
others
who
still
kept
adding
to
their
list
of
requirements
he
said
what
shall
i
bring
home
for
you
surely
you
too
wish
for
something
father
she
answered
wish
for
the
most
precious
thing
in
the
world
and
that
is
to
see
you
home
again
safe
and
sound
this
answer
covered
the
sisters
with
confusion
and
vexed
them
so
that
one
of
them
speaking
up
for
the
others
said
tartly
small
miss
is
putting
on
airs
she
thinks
no
doubt
she
cuts
a
figure
with
her
affected
fine
sentiments
her
father
however
was
touched
by
her
good
feeling
nevertheless
he
told
her
to
choose
something
said
he
your
age
it
is
only
natural
to
like
dresses
and
pretty
presents
dear
father
said
she
you
insist
i
will
beg
you
to
bring
me
home
a
rose
i
have
not
seen
one
since
we
came
to
live
here
and
i
love
roses
in
this
way
contrived
to
obey
her
father
and
yet
to
put
him
to
no
expense
the
day
came
for
the
merchant
to
embrace
them
all
and
bid
them
farewell
he
made
the
best
of
his
way
to
the
great
city
and
arrived
there
to
be
met
with
a
great
disappointment
to
be
sure
his
vessel
had
come
safely
to
port
but
his
partners
believing
him
dead
had
taken
possession
of
it
and
divided
the
cargo
between
them
to
make
good
his
claim
he
was
forced
to
bring
a
number
of
tedious
he
won
them
in
the
end
but
only
to
find
after
six
months
of
trouble
and
expense
that
he
was
almost
as
poor
as
when
he
started
to
make
his
misery
complete
he
was
forced
to
travel
back
in
the
winter
in
the
most
inclement
weather
so
that
by
the
time
he
reached
the
skirts
of
the
forest
he
was
ready
to
drop
with
fatigue
but
reminding
himself
that
his
home
was
now
not
many
leagues
away
he
called
up
what
strength
remained
to
him
as
he
pushed
on
through
the
forest
night
overtook
him
and
in
the
piercing
cold
half
buried
his
horse
and
he
in
the
deep
snow
that
hid
every
pathway
the
poor
merchant
feared
that
his
last
hour
had
come
not
so
much
as
a
hut
did
he
pass
the
only
shelter
to
be
found
was
the
trunk
of
a
hollow
tree
and
there
he
cowered
through
the
long
night
kept
awake
by
his
hunger
and
the
howling
of
the
wolves
nor
did
the
day
bring
him
much
comfort
for
thick
snow
lay
everywhere
and
not
a
path
was
to
be
seen
it
was
only
after
a
weary
search
that
he
managed
to
recover
his
horse
which
had
wandered
away
and
partly
sheltered
itself
in
another
hollow
tree
he
mounted
and
now
in
a
little
while
discovered
a
sort
of
track
which
presently
grew
easier
following
this
he
found
himself
in
an
avenue
of
trees
at
the
entrance
of
which
he
halted
and
rubbed
his
eyes
for
no
snow
had
fallen
in
this
avenue
and
the
trees
were
tall
planted
in
four
rows
and
covered
with
flowers
and
fruit
and
here
and
there
among
the
trees
were
statues
some
of
single
figures
others
of
groups
representing
scenes
of
war
but
all
coloured
like
real
life
at
the
end
of
the
avenue
straight
in
front
of
him
rose
a
magnificent
castle
in
many
terraces
the
merchant
rode
around
to
the
stable
courtyard
which
he
found
empty
and
there
with
hands
he
unbridled
and
stabled
his
horse
within
the
doorway
he
found
a
staircase
of
agate
with
balusters
of
carved
gold
he
mounted
it
and
passed
through
room
after
room
each
more
splendidly
furnished
than
the
last
they
were
deliciously
warm
too
and
he
began
to
feel
his
limbs
again
but
he
was
hungry
where
could
he
find
some
one
to
give
him
food
everywhere
was
silence
and
yet
the
place
had
no
look
of
being
abandoned
drawingrooms
bedchambers
galleries
all
stood
unlocked
at
last
tired
of
roaming
he
came
to
a
halt
in
an
apartment
where
some
one
had
lit
a
bright
fire
a
sofa
drawn
up
cosily
beside
it
invited
him
to
sit
and
warm
his
limbs
and
resting
there
he
closed
his
eyes
and
fell
into
deep
and
grateful
slumber
as
weariness
had
sent
him
to
sleep
so
hunger
awoke
him
he
opened
his
eyes
and
saw
at
his
elbow
a
table
with
meats
and
wine
upon
it
he
had
been
fasting
for
more
than
hours
and
lost
no
time
in
he
hoped
that
he
might
soon
have
sight
of
this
most
hospitable
entertainer
whoever
he
might
be
and
an
opportunity
of
thanking
him
still
no
one
appeared
and
now
this
good
food
did
for
him
what
fatigue
had
done
before
he
dropped
off
again
into
an
easy
slumber
which
lasted
for
four
hours
almost
again
awaking
he
saw
at
his
elbow
another
small
table
of
porphyry
this
time
upon
which
the
unknown
hands
had
set
out
a
dainty
meal
of
cakes
crystallised
fruits
and
liqueurs
to
this
too
he
did
justice
but
as
the
time
still
passed
and
no
one
appeared
he
began
to
feel
terrified
and
resolved
to
search
once
more
through
all
the
rooms
but
still
he
found
no
one
illustration
he
had
been
fasting
for
more
than
hours
and
lost
no
time
in
falling
to
he
was
standing
lost
in
thought
when
of
a
sudden
it
came
into
his
mind
that
some
kindly
power
had
perhaps
prepared
this
palace
of
wonder
for
him
that
it
with
all
its
riches
might
indeed
be
his
possessed
by
this
notion
he
once
again
made
a
tour
of
the
rooms
and
took
stock
of
their
treasures
planning
in
his
mind
how
he
would
divide
them
amongst
his
children
assigning
this
apartment
to
one
and
that
to
another
and
whispering
to
himself
what
joy
he
would
carry
home
after
all
from
his
journey
then
he
went
down
into
the
garden
where
though
it
was
the
depth
of
winter
the
birds
were
singing
and
the
air
breathed
the
scent
of
a
thousand
flowers
he
told
himself
daughters
will
be
happy
here
and
never
desire
any
more
to
go
back
to
the
city
quick
let
me
saddle
my
horse
at
once
and
ride
home
with
the
news
the
way
to
the
stable
was
an
alley
fenced
on
either
hand
with
palings
and
over
the
palings
hung
great
clusters
of
roses
in
bloom
they
reminded
him
of
his
promise
to
he
plucked
one
and
was
about
to
pluck
a
whole
nosegay
when
he
was
startled
by
a
horrible
noise
behind
him
and
attempted
to
turn
but
behind
him
stood
a
hideous
who
was
overtaking
him
and
reaching
out
towards
him
gave
you
leave
to
pluck
my
roses
roared
this
monster
it
not
enough
that
i
made
you
welcome
in
my
palace
and
treated
you
kindly
and
you
show
your
gratitude
by
stealing
my
flowers
but
your
insolence
shall
not
go
unpunished
the
good
merchant
terrified
no
less
by
the
sight
of
this
than
by
his
threats
let
drop
the
rose
and
flung
himself
on
his
knees
lord
he
cried
pity
on
me
i
am
not
ungrateful
but
after
all
your
kindness
i
could
not
guess
that
so
small
a
thing
would
offend
you
this
speech
did
not
at
all
abate
the
wrath
your
tongue
sir
he
commanded
you
can
offer
me
nothing
but
flatteries
and
false
titles
i
am
not
my
lord
i
am
the
and
your
words
will
not
save
you
from
the
death
you
deserve
the
merchant
although
in
fear
of
his
life
plucked
up
courage
to
tell
the
monster
that
the
rose
which
he
had
been
bold
to
pluck
was
for
one
of
his
daughters
by
name
then
in
hope
either
to
delay
the
vengeance
or
to
touch
his
compassion
he
launched
into
the
tale
of
all
his
misfortunes
and
of
his
reasons
for
the
journey
not
forgetting
to
mention
again
and
her
request
the
considered
for
a
moment
before
answering
him
in
a
somewhat
milder
tone
will
forgive
you
but
only
on
condition
that
you
give
me
one
of
your
daughters
must
make
amends
for
this
trespass
forgive
me
the
merchant
entreated
how
can
i
promise
such
a
thing
even
were
i
cruel
enough
to
purchase
my
life
at
the
cost
of
a
child
on
what
excuse
could
i
bring
her
excuse
is
necessary
replied
the
shortly
you
bring
must
come
here
of
her
own
free
will
or
not
at
all
go
home
and
try
if
there
be
one
brave
and
loving
enough
to
sacrifice
herself
to
save
your
life
you
seem
to
be
an
honest
man
give
me
your
word
to
return
here
at
the
end
of
a
month
and
bring
whichever
of
your
daughters
you
can
persuade
to
come
with
you
if
you
can
persuade
none
of
them
you
must
come
alone
and
i
warn
you
that
if
you
fail
of
it
i
shall
come
and
fetch
you
what
was
the
poor
man
to
do
he
promised
for
he
saw
death
staring
him
in
the
face
and
having
given
his
promise
he
hoped
to
be
allowed
to
depart
but
the
informed
him
that
he
could
not
go
until
next
day
said
he
daybreak
you
will
find
a
horse
ready
for
you
who
will
carry
you
home
in
less
than
no
time
now
go
and
eat
your
supper
and
await
my
commands
the
merchant
more
dead
than
alive
crept
back
to
his
rooms
there
before
a
blazing
fire
he
found
a
delicious
supper
spread
inviting
him
to
eat
but
so
distraught
was
he
that
no
food
however
delicious
could
have
tempted
him
had
he
not
been
afraid
that
the
might
be
hiding
somewhere
to
watch
him
in
fear
of
this
he
forced
himself
to
sit
and
taste
of
the
dishes
a
loud
noise
in
the
next
room
warned
him
that
the
was
coming
since
he
could
not
escape
he
mustered
what
courage
he
could
to
conceal
his
terror
and
faced
about
to
the
doorway
you
made
a
good
supper
was
the
first
question
the
merchant
in
humblest
voice
answered
that
thanks
to
his
host
kind
attention
he
had
fared
excellently
well
am
paying
you
a
visit
said
the
warn
you
again
to
be
honest
with
your
daughter
describe
me
to
her
just
as
i
am
let
her
be
free
to
choose
whether
she
will
come
or
no
but
tell
her
that
her
course
once
chosen
there
can
be
no
retreat
nor
even
reflection
after
you
have
brought
her
to
me
to
break
faith
then
will
avail
nothing
she
will
but
destroy
you
without
winning
her
own
release
again
the
merchant
repeated
his
promise
the
appeared
to
be
content
at
length
to
bed
now
he
commanded
do
not
get
up
until
you
see
the
sun
and
hear
a
golden
bell
rung
then
before
starting
you
will
find
breakfast
laid
for
you
here
your
horse
will
be
standing
ready
saddled
in
the
courtyard
and
you
may
carry
back
the
rose
to
your
daughter
as
you
call
her
for
the
rest
i
count
on
seeing
you
back
in
a
month
time
so
farewell
the
merchant
who
dared
not
disobey
a
single
one
of
these
orders
retired
to
bed
at
once
though
without
any
temptation
to
sleep
and
again
though
he
passed
a
wretched
night
he
was
punctual
to
rise
with
the
sun
a
golden
bell
rang
and
prompt
on
the
sound
he
found
breakfast
laid
still
by
unseen
hands
after
breakfast
he
went
down
to
the
stables
and
on
his
way
paused
to
pick
up
the
rose
which
lay
in
the
alley
where
it
had
dropped
from
his
hand
it
was
fresh
as
ever
and
smelt
as
sweetly
as
though
it
yet
grew
on
the
tree
a
few
paces
further
on
he
found
his
horse
standing
ready
saddled
with
a
handsome
cloak
of
furs
far
warmer
than
his
own
lying
across
the
saddle
he
put
it
on
and
mounted
and
now
he
had
to
wonder
at
yet
another
miracle
his
horse
set
off
at
an
incredible
speed
so
that
before
he
could
even
turn
in
the
saddle
the
palace
had
sunk
out
of
sight
could
the
horse
have
felt
the
weight
on
the
good
man
mind
it
had
never
made
such
a
pace
but
it
took
its
own
way
insensible
to
rein
or
bridle
nor
halted
until
it
reached
the
door
of
the
cottage
the
merchant
sons
and
daughters
had
rushed
out
at
his
approach
though
it
was
not
until
he
drew
quite
close
that
they
recognised
their
father
in
this
horseman
superbly
cloaked
with
a
rose
at
his
holster
and
mounted
on
a
horse
that
travelled
at
such
a
speed
when
they
recognised
him
they
made
sure
that
he
brought
the
best
of
news
but
the
tears
that
trickled
down
his
cheeks
as
he
dismounted
told
them
another
story
his
first
motion
then
was
to
pluck
the
fatal
rose
from
the
pommel
and
hand
it
to
saying
is
what
you
asked
me
to
bring
you
little
know
what
it
will
cost
you
all
this
and
his
sorrowful
look
gave
the
eldest
daughter
her
cue
was
certain
of
it
she
said
i
not
say
all
along
that
to
force
a
rose
at
this
time
of
the
year
would
cost
you
more
than
would
have
bought
presents
for
all
the
rest
of
us
a
rose
in
and
such
a
rose
there
one
has
only
to
look
at
it
to
see
that
you
took
good
care
should
have
her
present
no
matter
at
what
cost
to
us
is
all
too
true
answered
their
father
sorrowfully
this
rose
has
cost
me
dear
far
dearer
than
all
the
presents
you
others
begged
of
me
but
the
cost
is
not
in
money
for
would
to
god
i
could
have
bought
it
with
the
last
penny
in
my
purse
his
speech
you
may
be
sure
excited
their
curiosity
and
they
gave
him
no
rest
until
he
had
told
the
whole
of
his
story
it
left
their
hopes
utterly
dashed
and
the
daughters
lamented
their
lot
while
their
brothers
hardily
declared
that
they
would
never
allow
their
father
to
return
to
this
accursed
castle
they
would
march
thither
in
a
body
and
destroy
the
horrible
who
owned
it
but
their
father
assured
them
that
he
had
given
his
word
and
would
rather
die
than
break
it
thereat
the
sisters
turned
upon
and
started
to
upbraid
and
rail
against
her
is
all
your
fault
they
declared
this
is
what
comes
of
your
pretended
modesty
why
could
you
not
have
asked
for
dresses
and
jewels
as
we
did
even
if
you
could
not
get
them
at
least
the
demand
would
have
cost
nothing
but
you
chose
to
be
singular
you
with
your
precious
rose
and
now
our
father
must
die
and
we
must
all
suffer
through
your
affectation
poor
controlled
her
tears
and
answered
them
i
am
to
blame
for
all
this
though
indeed
dear
sisters
i
did
it
innocently
for
how
could
i
guess
that
to
ask
for
a
rose
in
the
middle
of
summer
as
it
was
then
would
give
rise
to
all
this
misery
but
what
does
that
matter
innocent
or
guilty
i
can
not
allow
you
to
suffer
for
what
was
my
fault
and
so
i
will
go
back
with
our
father
to
save
him
from
his
promise
that
will
be
in
a
month
time
and
in
this
little
month
i
beg
of
you
let
us
be
happy
together
without
reproaches
at
first
her
brothers
would
not
hear
of
any
such
sacrifice
and
her
father
was
equally
set
against
it
until
the
sisters
again
fired
up
in
their
jealousy
and
accused
him
of
being
distressed
only
because
it
happened
to
be
if
another
of
his
daughters
they
hinted
had
offered
to
pay
this
price
for
his
life
he
would
have
accepted
it
cheerfully
enough
closed
this
talk
by
saying
firmly
that
whether
they
wished
it
or
not
she
would
go
who
knows
said
she
forcing
a
brave
smile
this
fate
of
mine
which
seems
so
terrible
may
cover
some
extraordinary
and
happy
fortune
she
said
it
merely
to
hearten
them
but
her
sisters
fancying
her
deluded
by
vanity
and
smiled
maliciously
and
applauded
so
their
father
gave
way
and
it
was
agreed
that
must
go
for
her
part
she
desired
only
that
the
few
days
remaining
to
her
might
be
as
happy
as
possible
and
so
as
they
passed
she
spoke
little
of
what
was
before
her
and
if
at
all
only
to
treat
it
lightly
and
as
a
piece
of
good
fortune
when
the
time
drew
near
she
shared
up
all
her
trinkets
and
little
possessions
with
her
sisters
for
badly
as
they
had
treated
her
they
were
the
only
friends
she
had
yet
jealousy
had
made
their
hearts
so
wicked
that
when
the
fatal
day
arrived
they
actually
rejoiced
to
hear
the
neighing
of
a
horse
which
punctually
sent
by
the
arrived
at
the
door
of
the
cottage
illustration
soon
they
caught
sight
of
the
castle
in
the
distance
the
brothers
would
have
rushed
out
and
slain
the
beautiful
animal
but
mastering
their
anger
with
a
few
tender
words
bade
her
father
mount
into
the
saddle
and
so
after
bidding
her
sisters
farewell
with
a
tenderness
that
forced
them
to
weep
at
the
last
climbed
to
the
pillion
behind
him
quite
as
if
she
were
setting
out
for
a
holiday
they
were
off
the
horse
seemed
to
fly
rather
than
to
gallop
so
smoothly
that
could
scarcely
feel
the
motion
save
by
the
soft
wind
that
beat
on
her
cheek
soon
they
caught
sight
of
the
castle
in
the
distance
her
father
less
happy
than
she
again
and
again
asked
and
begged
her
to
alight
and
return
a
most
idle
offer
for
he
had
no
real
control
of
the
reins
but
did
not
listen
because
her
mind
was
made
up
nevertheless
she
was
awed
and
all
the
more
when
as
the
fleet
horse
galloped
up
to
the
courtyard
they
were
met
by
a
great
salvo
of
guns
and
as
the
echoes
died
away
by
the
sound
of
soft
music
within
the
palace
the
horse
had
come
to
a
stop
by
a
flight
of
agate
steps
a
light
shone
down
these
steps
from
a
porchway
within
which
the
violins
kept
their
throbbing
slipped
down
from
the
saddle
and
her
father
alighting
after
her
took
her
by
the
hand
and
led
her
to
the
chamber
in
which
he
had
first
supped
where
sure
enough
they
found
a
cheerful
fire
and
a
score
of
candles
lit
and
burning
with
an
exquisite
perfume
and
best
of
all
a
table
laid
with
the
daintiest
of
suppers
the
merchant
accustomed
to
the
ways
of
their
host
knew
that
the
supper
was
meant
for
them
and
with
a
good
appetite
her
spirits
indeed
were
rising
there
had
been
no
sign
of
any
in
all
the
many
rooms
through
which
she
had
passed
and
everything
in
them
had
seemed
to
breathe
of
gaiety
and
good
living
but
this
happy
frame
of
mind
did
not
last
long
they
had
scarcely
finished
supper
when
the
was
heard
coming
through
the
distant
rooms
at
the
sound
the
heavy
padding
of
his
feet
the
roar
of
his
breath
clung
to
her
father
in
terror
and
had
almost
fainted
against
the
arm
which
he
flung
around
her
but
when
the
stood
before
her
in
the
doorway
after
a
little
shudder
she
walked
towards
him
with
a
firm
step
and
halting
at
a
little
distance
saluted
him
respectfully
this
behaviour
evidently
pleased
the
after
letting
his
eyes
rest
on
her
face
for
a
while
he
said
in
a
tone
that
might
well
have
struck
terror
into
the
boldest
heart
and
yet
it
did
not
seem
to
be
angry
evening
my
good
sir
good
evening
the
merchant
was
too
far
terrified
to
find
his
voice
but
controlled
hers
and
answered
sweetly
evening
you
come
here
of
your
own
free
will
asked
the
are
you
willing
to
let
your
father
return
and
leave
you
here
answered
that
she
was
quite
willing
and
yet
what
do
you
suppose
will
happen
to
you
after
he
has
gone
said
is
as
it
pleases
you
and
you
only
can
tell
answered
replied
the
since
you
have
come
of
your
own
accord
you
shall
stay
as
for
you
my
good
sir
said
he
to
the
merchant
will
take
your
departure
at
sunrise
the
bell
will
give
you
warning
delay
not
to
rise
eat
your
breakfast
and
depart
as
before
but
remember
that
you
are
forbidden
ever
to
come
within
sight
of
my
palace
again
then
turning
to
he
said
your
father
into
the
next
room
and
choose
between
you
everything
you
think
will
please
your
brothers
and
sisters
you
will
find
there
two
travelling
trunks
fill
them
as
full
as
they
will
hold
sorrowful
as
she
was
at
the
certainty
of
losing
her
father
so
soon
and
for
ever
made
ready
to
obey
the
orders
and
he
left
them
as
he
had
come
saying
night
good
night
good
sir
when
they
were
alone
and
her
father
went
into
the
next
room
which
proved
to
be
a
piled
with
treasures
a
king
and
queen
might
have
envied
after
choosing
and
setting
apart
in
heaps
one
for
each
of
her
sisters
the
most
magnificent
dresses
she
could
find
opened
a
cupboard
which
had
a
door
of
crystal
framed
in
gold
and
stood
for
a
moment
dazzled
by
the
precious
stones
that
lay
piled
on
every
shelf
after
choosing
a
vast
number
and
adding
them
to
her
heaps
she
opened
yet
another
wardrobe
and
found
it
full
of
money
in
gold
pieces
this
set
her
pondering
think
father
she
said
we
had
better
empty
these
trunks
again
and
fill
them
with
money
for
money
can
always
be
turned
to
account
whereas
to
sell
these
precious
stones
you
would
have
to
go
to
some
jeweller
who
very
likely
would
cheat
you
and
perhaps
be
suspicious
of
them
but
with
these
pieces
of
gold
you
can
buy
land
houses
furniture
jewels
what
you
will
and
no
one
will
ask
any
questions
her
father
agreed
yet
he
first
of
all
tried
to
make
room
for
the
money
by
emptying
out
the
few
things
he
had
packed
for
himself
but
this
was
no
good
for
it
seemed
that
the
trunks
were
made
in
folds
which
opened
the
wider
the
more
he
put
in
somehow
the
more
they
packed
the
more
room
there
seemed
to
be
and
they
ended
by
replacing
all
the
dresses
and
precious
stones
they
had
taken
out
but
now
the
trunks
were
so
heavy
that
an
elephant
would
have
sunk
under
them
is
all
a
cheat
cried
the
merchant
the
is
mocking
us
and
only
pretended
to
give
us
these
things
knowing
that
i
could
not
carry
them
away
a
little
advised
would
be
a
sorry
jest
and
i
can
not
help
thinking
that
the
is
honest
and
that
since
he
offered
these
gifts
he
will
find
you
also
the
means
to
carry
them
the
best
thing
we
can
do
is
to
strap
up
the
trunks
and
leave
them
ready
here
so
they
did
this
and
went
back
to
the
little
room
where
to
their
amazement
they
found
a
breakfast
laid
on
the
table
for
a
moment
they
could
scarcely
believe
that
the
night
had
flown
by
whilst
they
were
occupied
in
ransacking
the
treasure
chamber
and
packing
the
trunks
but
glancing
at
the
windows
they
saw
that
day
was
indeed
breaking
and
presently
a
bell
sounded
warning
the
merchant
to
eat
quickly
and
depart
he
finished
his
meal
and
they
went
down
together
to
the
courtyard
where
two
horses
stood
ready
the
one
laden
with
the
two
trunks
the
other
saddled
for
the
merchant
to
ride
and
now
and
her
father
would
fain
have
spent
a
long
time
in
bidding
one
another
farewell
but
the
two
horses
neighed
and
pawed
the
ground
so
impatiently
that
he
was
afraid
to
linger
tearing
himself
from
his
daughter
arms
he
mounted
in
haste
and
could
scarcely
turn
to
say
before
both
horses
sprang
away
swift
as
the
wind
and
he
was
lost
to
sight
in
an
instant
poor
she
gazed
and
gazed
through
her
tears
and
so
mounted
the
stairs
sorrowfully
back
to
her
own
chamber
on
reaching
it
she
felt
herself
oppressed
with
sleepiness
for
she
had
passed
the
night
without
undressing
and
moreover
for
a
month
past
her
sleep
had
been
broken
and
haunted
with
terrors
so
having
nothing
better
to
do
she
went
to
bed
and
was
nestling
down
in
the
perfumed
sheets
when
her
eyes
fell
on
the
little
table
by
the
bedside
some
one
had
set
a
cup
of
hot
chocolate
there
and
half
asleep
she
reached
out
her
hand
for
it
and
drank
it
whereupon
her
eyes
closed
and
she
fell
into
a
delicious
slumber
such
as
she
had
not
known
since
the
day
when
her
father
brought
home
the
fatal
rose
she
dreamed
that
she
was
walking
alongside
an
endless
canal
the
banks
of
which
were
bordered
with
tall
and
myrtles
in
flower
there
as
she
wandered
disconsolately
lamenting
her
fate
of
a
sudden
a
young
stood
before
her
he
was
handsome
as
the
god
of
love
in
and
when
he
spoke
it
was
with
a
voice
that
went
straight
to
her
heart
he
said
are
not
so
unfortunate
as
you
suppose
it
is
here
you
shall
find
the
reward
of
your
goodness
denied
to
you
elsewhere
use
your
wits
to
find
me
out
under
the
disguise
which
hides
me
that
is
if
as
i
stand
here
now
you
find
me
not
altogether
contemptible
for
i
love
you
tenderly
you
alone
and
in
making
me
happy
you
can
attain
to
your
own
happiness
beloved
never
distrust
your
own
true
heart
and
it
shall
lead
you
where
the
heart
has
nothing
left
to
desire
so
saying
the
charming
apparition
knelt
at
her
feet
and
again
besought
her
to
accept
his
devotion
and
become
mistress
over
all
his
life
what
can
i
do
to
make
you
happy
she
asked
earnestly
be
grateful
he
answered
do
not
believe
all
that
your
eyes
would
tell
you
above
all
do
not
abandon
me
until
you
have
rescued
me
from
the
cruel
sufferings
i
endure
with
that
the
dream
melted
away
but
only
to
be
succeeded
by
another
she
found
herself
face
to
face
with
a
stately
and
beautiful
lady
and
the
lady
was
speaking
to
her
with
dignity
yet
most
kindly
she
said
not
grieve
for
what
you
have
left
behind
a
far
higher
destiny
lies
before
you
only
if
you
would
deserve
it
beware
of
being
misled
by
appearances
found
her
dreams
so
agreeable
that
she
was
in
no
hurry
at
all
to
awake
and
even
when
her
eyes
opened
to
the
daylight
she
had
more
than
half
a
mind
to
close
them
again
but
a
clock
chiming
out
her
own
name
twelve
times
warned
her
that
it
was
midday
and
time
to
get
up
she
rose
therefore
and
found
her
set
out
with
brushes
and
combs
and
everything
she
could
want
and
having
dressed
carefully
and
with
a
lightness
of
heart
for
which
she
found
it
hard
to
account
she
passed
into
the
next
room
and
found
her
dinner
on
the
table
dinner
does
not
take
very
long
when
you
are
all
by
yourself
when
she
had
eaten
enough
sat
down
on
a
sofa
and
began
to
think
of
the
handsome
youth
she
had
seen
in
her
dream
told
me
i
could
make
him
happy
why
then
it
must
be
that
the
horrible
who
appears
to
be
master
here
is
keeping
him
a
prisoner
how
can
i
set
him
free
they
both
warned
me
not
to
trust
to
appearances
it
is
all
very
puzzling
but
one
thing
is
clear
at
any
rate
that
i
am
very
silly
to
be
vexing
my
head
over
a
dream
i
will
forget
all
about
it
and
look
for
something
to
do
to
amuse
myself
she
sprang
up
and
started
to
make
a
tour
of
discovery
through
the
many
rooms
of
the
palace
they
were
even
grander
than
she
had
expected
the
first
she
entered
was
lined
with
mirrors
from
floor
to
ceiling
where
she
saw
herself
reflected
on
every
side
the
next
thing
to
catch
her
eye
was
a
bracelet
hanging
from
one
of
the
chandeliers
set
in
the
bracelet
was
a
gold
locket
and
opening
this
she
was
startled
indeed
for
it
contained
a
portrait
in
miniature
of
the
gallant
youth
she
had
seen
in
her
dream
she
could
not
be
mistaken
so
closely
were
his
features
engraved
on
her
memory
yes
and
it
may
be
on
her
heart
she
slipped
the
bracelet
on
her
wrist
without
stopping
to
think
that
it
did
not
belong
to
her
and
went
on
to
explore
further
she
passed
into
a
long
picture
gallery
and
there
again
she
met
the
face
it
smiled
down
at
her
this
time
from
a
portrait
and
it
seemed
to
smile
so
wistfully
that
she
caught
herself
blushing
from
the
gallery
her
steps
had
led
her
to
a
chamber
filled
with
instruments
of
music
was
an
accomplished
musician
so
sitting
down
she
amused
herself
by
tuning
and
trying
over
one
instrument
after
another
but
she
liked
the
harp
best
because
that
went
best
with
her
voice
leaving
the
at
length
she
found
herself
in
a
long
chamber
like
the
picture
gallery
but
lined
with
books
it
held
an
immense
library
and
ever
since
she
had
lived
in
the
country
had
been
forced
to
do
without
reading
for
her
father
had
sold
all
his
books
to
pay
his
debts
now
as
her
eyes
travelled
along
the
shelves
she
knew
she
need
never
have
any
fear
that
time
would
pass
heavily
here
the
dusk
was
gathering
before
she
had
even
the
titles
of
the
thousands
of
volumes
and
numbers
of
candles
waxen
and
scented
in
chandeliers
with
lustres
of
diamonds
and
rubies
were
beginning
to
light
themselves
in
every
room
in
due
time
found
supper
laid
and
served
for
her
with
the
same
good
taste
and
orderliness
as
before
and
still
she
had
seen
no
living
face
what
did
this
matter
her
father
had
warned
her
that
she
would
be
solitary
and
she
was
beginning
to
tell
herself
that
she
could
be
solitary
here
without
much
discomfort
when
she
heard
the
noise
of
the
approaching
she
could
not
help
trembling
a
little
for
she
had
not
yet
found
herself
alone
with
him
and
knew
not
what
would
happen
he
might
even
be
coming
to
devour
her
but
when
he
appeared
he
did
not
seem
at
all
ferocious
evening
he
said
gruffly
evening
she
answered
gently
but
shaking
a
little
you
think
you
can
be
content
here
he
asked
answered
politely
that
it
ought
not
to
be
hard
to
live
happily
in
such
a
beautiful
palace
after
this
they
talked
for
an
hour
and
in
the
course
of
their
talk
began
to
excuse
many
things
in
the
his
voice
for
example
with
such
a
nose
how
could
he
help
roaring
through
it
really
he
appeared
to
be
wanting
in
tact
rather
than
purposely
terrible
though
to
be
sure
this
want
of
tact
terrified
her
cruelly
when
at
length
he
blurted
out
you
be
my
wife
i
am
lost
thought
the
could
not
be
so
after
all
for
though
she
kept
the
cry
to
herself
he
answered
quickly
and
just
as
if
she
had
uttered
it
aloud
at
all
i
wish
you
to
answer
just
yes
or
no
no
well
then
said
this
tractable
monster
you
will
not
i
had
best
be
going
good
night
night
answered
relieved
of
her
fright
she
felt
sure
now
that
he
did
not
mean
to
hurt
her
and
as
soon
as
he
had
taken
his
leave
she
went
off
to
bed
and
was
asleep
in
no
time
but
almost
as
quickly
she
was
dreaming
and
in
her
dream
at
once
she
saw
her
unknown
lover
standing
beside
her
handsome
as
ever
but
more
sorrowful
than
before
he
said
are
you
so
cruel
to
me
i
love
you
the
better
for
being
so
stubborn
and
yet
it
lengthens
out
my
misery
she
could
not
understand
this
at
all
her
dream
wavered
and
it
seemed
to
her
that
he
took
a
hundred
different
shapes
in
it
now
he
had
a
crown
between
his
hands
and
was
offering
it
to
her
now
he
was
kneeling
at
her
feet
now
he
smiled
radiant
with
joy
and
again
he
buried
his
head
in
despair
and
wept
till
the
sound
of
his
sobbing
pierced
her
heart
thus
in
one
aspect
or
another
he
was
with
her
the
night
through
she
awoke
with
him
in
her
thoughts
and
her
first
act
was
to
unclasp
the
locket
on
her
wrist
and
assure
herself
that
the
miniature
was
like
him
it
certainly
was
the
same
face
and
his
too
was
the
face
that
smiled
down
from
the
larger
portrait
in
the
gallery
but
the
face
in
the
locket
gave
her
a
more
secret
joy
and
she
unclasped
and
gazed
on
it
again
and
again
this
morning
she
went
down
into
the
gardens
where
the
sun
shone
inviting
her
to
ramble
they
were
beyond
imagination
lovely
here
stood
a
statue
showered
over
with
roses
there
fountain
on
fountain
played
and
threw
a
refreshing
spray
so
high
in
the
air
that
her
eyes
could
scarcely
reach
to
its
summit
but
what
most
surprised
her
was
that
every
nook
and
corner
recalled
those
she
had
seen
in
her
dreams
with
the
unknown
standing
beside
her
at
length
she
came
to
the
long
canal
with
the
oranges
and
myrtles
in
the
shade
of
which
she
had
first
seen
him
approach
it
was
the
very
spot
and
she
could
no
longer
disbelieve
that
her
dreams
were
real
she
felt
sure
now
that
he
must
somehow
be
imprisoned
here
and
resolved
to
get
at
the
truth
that
very
evening
should
the
repeat
his
visit
tired
at
length
of
wandering
she
returned
to
the
palace
and
discovered
a
new
room
full
of
materials
for
work
to
engage
the
most
idle
distaffs
and
shuttles
frames
for
tapestry
ribbons
to
make
into
bows
silks
for
embroidery
scissors
and
thimbles
beyond
this
needlework
room
a
door
opened
upon
the
most
wonderful
sight
of
all
an
aviary
full
of
the
rarest
birds
yet
all
so
tame
that
they
flew
to
and
perched
themselves
on
her
shoulders
birds
she
said
wish
you
were
closer
to
my
own
room
that
i
might
sit
and
hear
you
singing
she
had
scarcely
said
it
when
opening
a
door
beyond
the
aviary
she
found
herself
in
her
own
chamber
yes
her
very
own
which
she
had
thought
to
be
quite
on
the
other
side
of
the
building
the
door
when
she
came
to
examine
it
had
a
shutter
which
could
be
opened
to
hear
and
closed
again
when
she
grew
tired
of
it
this
aviary
opened
on
another
inhabited
by
parrots
parroquets
and
cockatoos
these
no
sooner
saw
than
they
began
to
scream
and
chatter
one
wishing
her
morning
another
inviting
her
to
luncheon
while
a
third
yet
more
gallant
cried
me
kiss
me
others
again
whistled
airs
from
grand
opera
or
declaimed
pieces
of
poetry
by
the
best
authors
it
was
plain
that
in
their
several
ways
they
all
had
the
same
object
to
amuse
her
beyond
the
aviaries
lay
a
monkey
house
here
were
apes
of
all
sorts
barbary
apes
mandarin
apes
apes
with
blue
faces
baboons
marmosets
chimpanzees
and
all
came
frisking
about
her
bowing
and
scraping
to
show
how
much
they
appreciated
the
honour
of
this
visit
to
celebrate
it
they
stretched
a
and
danced
and
threw
somersaults
with
an
agility
which
found
highly
diverting
and
yet
she
could
not
help
sighing
that
none
of
these
animals
were
able
to
tell
her
news
of
her
unknown
she
patted
and
made
much
of
them
however
and
asked
if
some
of
them
would
be
kind
enough
to
come
with
her
and
keep
her
company
at
once
and
as
if
they
had
only
been
waiting
for
this
command
two
large
in
sweeping
stepped
to
her
side
and
became
her
maids
of
honour
two
brisk
little
marmosets
volunteered
for
pages
and
held
up
her
train
while
an
affable
baboon
his
face
wreathed
with
smiles
bowed
presented
a
gloved
hand
and
begged
leave
to
squire
her
with
this
singular
escort
marched
back
to
luncheon
and
while
she
ate
it
the
birds
piped
and
fluted
around
her
for
accompaniment
to
the
parrots
who
lifted
up
their
voices
and
chanted
the
latest
and
most
fashionable
tunes
nay
more
the
meal
was
no
sooner
ended
than
the
apes
begged
her
to
allow
them
to
entertain
her
with
a
light
comedy
which
leave
being
granted
they
proceeded
to
act
in
a
highly
creditable
manner
and
with
appropriate
while
the
parrots
spoke
the
words
from
the
wings
very
distinctly
and
in
accents
that
exactly
conformed
with
the
various
parts
at
the
close
one
of
the
actors
advanced
laid
his
hand
on
his
heart
and
still
with
the
parrot
for
interpreter
thanked
for
the
indulgence
she
had
shown
to
their
poor
efforts
that
night
again
after
supper
the
paid
her
his
accustomed
visit
he
put
the
same
questions
and
received
her
answers
as
before
and
as
before
the
conversation
ended
by
his
taking
leave
of
her
with
a
night
the
two
as
thereupon
undressed
their
mistress
and
saw
her
to
bed
before
leaving
they
thoughtfully
opened
the
that
the
soft
of
the
birds
might
soothe
her
to
sleep
and
dream
of
her
lover
in
this
fashion
day
followed
day
and
still
found
plenty
to
amuse
her
at
the
end
of
a
week
she
made
the
most
wonderful
discovery
of
all
there
was
one
large
room
which
she
had
entered
but
once
because
it
seemed
to
her
rather
dull
and
dark
too
it
was
empty
and
although
it
had
four
windows
in
each
wall
but
two
of
them
admitted
any
light
one
day
as
she
passed
the
door
the
fancy
took
her
to
open
one
of
these
windows
she
stepped
in
and
drew
the
shutter
when
to
her
astonishment
it
opened
not
upon
daylight
at
all
but
what
seemed
to
be
a
dim
hall
lit
only
by
a
glimmer
distant
and
faint
behind
the
chinks
of
a
thick
curtain
at
the
further
end
she
was
wondering
what
this
might
mean
when
the
curtain
went
up
and
in
a
sudden
flood
of
light
she
found
herself
gazing
as
from
a
box
into
a
theatre
crowded
from
floor
to
ceiling
and
with
an
audience
brilliant
in
dresses
and
jewels
an
orchestra
played
the
overture
and
gave
place
to
the
actors
real
actors
this
time
not
apes
and
parrots
the
play
was
charming
and
in
ecstasy
with
every
scene
of
it
when
the
curtain
fell
she
still
lingered
in
her
box
hoping
to
see
the
fashionable
crowd
disperse
but
somewhat
to
her
chagrin
the
lights
went
out
almost
at
once
and
the
theatre
was
dark
again
still
it
had
been
very
pleasant
and
she
promised
herself
to
become
a
constant
playgoer
that
evening
when
the
paid
his
visit
she
told
him
all
about
the
comedy
you
like
that
sort
of
thing
do
you
asked
the
monster
you
shall
have
as
much
of
it
as
you
like
you
are
so
pretty
could
not
help
smiling
inwardly
at
his
clumsy
compliments
but
she
smiled
no
longer
when
he
put
to
her
once
again
his
blunt
question
will
you
be
my
wife
she
answered
as
before
but
she
was
really
beginning
to
get
frightened
he
was
so
gentle
and
so
persistent
she
sat
up
so
long
thinking
over
this
that
it
was
almost
daylight
before
she
closed
her
eyes
in
bed
and
at
once
as
if
impatient
at
being
kept
waiting
the
lover
of
her
dreams
presented
himself
perhaps
for
this
reason
he
was
not
in
the
best
of
tempers
at
any
rate
he
taxed
her
with
being
moody
and
discontented
should
be
happy
enough
she
answered
the
did
not
pester
me
so
i
i
almost
think
by
his
foolish
compliments
that
he
would
like
me
to
marry
him
expected
her
to
show
some
jealousy
at
this
seeing
that
he
merely
stood
glum
she
went
on
you
really
be
content
if
i
married
him
but
alas
no
were
he
as
charming
as
he
is
hideous
you
know
that
i
love
you
and
can
never
love
any
one
else
by
all
rights
the
should
have
been
in
raptures
at
this
avowal
but
all
his
answer
was
love
him
who
best
loves
you
do
not
be
led
astray
by
appearances
and
so
you
will
free
me
from
captivity
was
not
only
puzzling
it
seemed
to
to
be
just
a
little
selfish
least
she
said
me
what
to
do
since
liberty
appears
to
be
your
first
wish
believe
me
i
would
liberate
you
at
any
sacrifice
if
only
i
knew
how
but
this
was
what
she
could
never
discover
and
because
of
it
her
nights
now
though
she
longed
for
them
troubled
her
more
than
her
days
her
days
passed
pleasantly
enough
and
still
in
fresh
discoveries
one
by
one
in
their
turn
she
opened
the
windows
of
the
great
hall
and
they
revealed
first
a
grand
performance
of
opera
and
she
listened
not
to
the
singers
only
but
to
the
murmur
of
the
audience
between
the
acts
to
listen
to
this
and
to
gaze
on
human
faces
gave
her
an
inexpressible
pleasure
next
a
great
fair
in
progress
when
first
she
looked
the
throng
had
not
arrived
and
she
inspected
the
booths
at
leisure
with
their
various
wares
as
the
spectators
drifted
in
the
drums
began
to
beat
the
hobby
horses
to
revolve
the
showmen
to
shout
the
marionettes
to
perform
in
their
little
theatre
it
was
ravishing
after
this
she
beheld
a
fashionable
promenade
with
a
richly
dressed
crowd
passing
exchanging
remarking
how
superb
was
the
weather
and
pausing
to
con
and
criticise
the
shop
windows
to
right
and
left
the
next
spectacle
was
a
with
the
players
seated
at
their
cards
or
roulette
the
croupiers
spinning
the
ball
or
raking
the
money
with
nothing
to
stake
had
leisure
to
observe
their
faces
and
how
sadly
some
left
the
tables
who
had
come
smiling
with
money
in
their
pockets
she
saw
too
that
some
were
being
cheated
and
it
vexed
her
because
she
could
not
warn
them
next
she
was
gazing
at
the
royal
palace
where
the
king
and
queen
were
holding
a
reception
she
saw
ambassadors
with
their
wives
lords
and
ladies
and
state
counsellors
and
watched
them
as
they
passed
by
the
throne
making
their
lowest
bows
a
water
picnic
followed
this
the
boats
lay
moored
alongside
a
bank
where
the
sat
or
lounged
and
talked
to
the
sound
of
lutes
the
picnic
ended
in
a
ball
with
violins
playing
and
couples
advancing
and
retreating
on
the
waxed
floor
that
shone
in
the
light
of
a
thousand
candles
oh
how
longed
to
be
one
of
the
dancers
but
perhaps
the
last
window
gave
her
the
most
pleasure
for
through
it
she
was
able
to
see
the
whole
world
at
one
gaze
and
all
that
was
going
on
in
it
state
embassies
royal
weddings
coronations
pageants
armies
revolutions
sieges
pitched
battles
she
could
sit
at
her
ease
and
watch
them
all
which
was
far
more
amusing
than
it
is
to
read
about
them
in
a
newspaper
she
ought
you
will
say
to
have
been
happy
as
the
day
was
long
but
no
a
life
becomes
flat
and
stale
which
is
a
perpetual
round
of
pleasure
and
leaves
nothing
to
sigh
or
to
hope
for
began
to
long
for
a
sight
of
her
father
and
her
brothers
and
sisters
she
concealed
this
for
a
while
however
and
turned
her
thoughts
to
what
was
more
pressing
for
she
could
not
beg
leave
to
go
home
until
something
had
been
done
to
rescue
her
dear
unknown
and
restore
him
to
liberty
the
alone
she
reflected
could
tell
her
the
secret
and
she
thought
to
herself
that
being
himself
so
blunt
of
speech
he
would
forgive
some
bluntness
in
her
so
one
evening
she
asked
him
are
we
alone
in
this
palace
with
nobody
but
ourselves
course
we
are
he
answered
gruffly
but
the
question
appeared
in
some
way
to
sting
him
for
almost
at
once
he
rose
and
bade
her
good
night
now
whatever
else
she
thought
of
the
had
by
this
time
learnt
to
trust
him
for
honest
it
was
a
dreadful
disappointment
therefore
to
be
forced
to
believe
on
his
word
that
her
had
no
existence
outside
of
her
fancy
she
slept
ill
that
night
in
her
dream
she
was
wandering
again
and
sorrowfully
alongside
the
canal
when
her
lover
appeared
and
took
her
hands
between
his
while
he
scanned
her
face
all
bathed
in
tears
has
gone
wrong
dear
he
demanded
are
you
in
this
distress
ah
it
is
the
who
persecutes
you
but
never
fear
you
shall
be
delivered
here
and
now
from
his
attention
and
with
these
words
the
snatched
out
a
dagger
and
rushed
on
the
monster
who
now
for
the
first
time
came
into
the
dream
advancing
slowly
down
the
bank
of
the
canal
strange
to
say
he
offered
no
resistance
even
when
the
dagger
almost
touched
his
throat
but
whom
an
unseen
power
held
back
as
she
would
have
run
to
prevent
the
murder
on
the
instant
found
voice
to
cry
stay
rash
fool
or
kill
me
before
you
kill
him
who
has
been
my
best
friend
answered
back
the
still
with
his
dagger
lifted
am
i
no
more
than
that
are
an
unfaithful
one
at
any
rate
persisted
knowing
well
that
i
would
lay
down
my
life
for
you
you
would
take
the
life
of
one
who
has
done
me
so
much
kindness
while
she
pleaded
the
figures
wavered
in
her
dream
still
struggling
together
and
vanished
giving
place
to
the
same
stately
lady
she
had
seen
in
her
former
vision
said
this
fresh
phantom
happiness
is
not
far
off
if
only
you
will
go
your
own
way
and
trust
not
to
appearances
this
dream
left
so
uneasy
that
next
day
she
opened
one
window
after
another
to
cure
her
restlessness
and
when
this
would
not
do
all
the
windows
together
but
still
in
vain
that
night
when
the
beast
paid
his
usual
visit
he
detected
almost
at
once
that
she
had
been
weeping
and
demanded
the
reason
sir
said
only
i
might
go
home
wish
to
go
home
face
turned
pale
which
for
such
a
face
was
no
easy
matter
he
staggered
backwards
with
a
deep
sigh
or
rather
a
roar
of
grief
would
you
desert
a
poor
what
more
can
i
do
to
make
you
happy
or
is
it
because
you
hate
me
that
you
wish
to
be
gone
illustration
ah
what
a
fright
you
have
given
me
she
murmured
answered
gently
do
not
hate
you
and
i
should
be
very
sorry
never
to
see
you
again
but
i
do
long
to
see
my
own
people
let
me
go
home
for
two
months
only
and
i
promise
to
come
back
and
stay
with
you
for
the
rest
of
my
life
the
had
fallen
flat
and
lay
along
the
carpet
at
her
feet
his
eyes
were
closed
and
for
some
while
his
heavy
sighs
alone
told
her
that
he
was
neither
dead
nor
in
a
swoon
by
and
by
he
lifted
his
head
can
deny
you
nothing
he
said
sadly
no
matter
though
it
cost
me
my
life
in
the
room
next
to
your
bedroom
you
will
find
four
chests
fill
them
with
everything
you
would
like
to
take
with
you
be
sure
to
keep
your
word
for
if
you
break
it
and
come
back
to
find
your
poor
dead
you
will
be
sorry
when
it
is
too
late
come
back
at
the
end
of
two
months
and
you
will
find
me
alive
and
to
come
back
you
will
not
need
chariot
or
horses
only
say
that
night
to
your
father
and
brothers
and
sisters
and
when
you
are
turn
this
ring
round
on
your
finger
and
say
firmly
i
wish
to
go
back
to
my
palace
and
see
my
again
that
is
all
good
night
sleep
soundly
and
in
good
time
you
shall
see
your
father
once
more
as
soon
as
he
was
gone
set
to
work
to
fill
the
four
boxes
with
all
the
riches
and
finery
that
heart
could
desire
she
filled
them
to
the
brim
and
then
tired
out
she
went
to
bed
but
for
a
long
while
she
could
not
close
her
eyes
for
excitement
it
was
not
until
close
upon
sunrise
that
sleep
visited
her
and
with
it
another
dream
in
this
dream
she
saw
her
beloved
unknown
stretched
at
full
length
on
a
bank
of
turf
his
face
was
hidden
and
she
could
hear
that
he
was
sobbing
but
when
touched
by
the
sight
of
his
grief
she
drew
near
to
console
him
he
lifted
his
face
to
her
and
said
how
can
you
ask
what
ails
me
when
you
are
leaving
me
and
your
going
is
my
death
warrant
dearest
said
am
only
going
to
tell
my
father
and
brothers
and
sisters
that
i
am
well
and
happy
in
a
short
while
i
shall
be
back
never
to
leave
you
again
but
for
that
matter
she
went
on
as
a
new
thought
struck
her
should
we
be
separated
at
all
i
will
put
off
my
going
for
another
day
and
i
will
beg
the
to
let
you
go
with
me
i
am
sure
he
will
not
refuse
can
only
go
with
you
if
you
promise
me
never
to
come
back
replied
the
after
all
when
you
have
once
delivered
me
why
should
we
ever
come
back
the
will
be
hurt
in
his
feelings
and
very
angry
no
doubt
but
by
that
time
we
shall
be
beyond
his
power
forget
reminded
him
sharply
i
have
promised
him
to
return
and
that
moreover
he
says
he
will
die
of
grief
if
i
break
my
word
what
if
he
does
demanded
her
lover
not
your
happiness
worth
more
than
the
life
of
a
monster
of
what
use
is
he
in
the
world
except
to
frighten
folks
out
of
their
wits
you
do
not
understand
cried
monster
as
you
call
him
is
only
a
monster
in
his
face
and
through
no
fault
of
his
he
has
the
kindest
heart
in
the
world
and
how
could
i
be
so
ungrateful
after
all
he
has
done
for
me
believe
said
her
lover
bitterly
if
you
saw
us
fighting
of
the
two
you
would
rather
let
me
perish
than
this
of
yours
told
him
that
he
was
cruel
and
unjust
and
begged
him
to
talk
of
something
else
she
set
the
example
too
seeing
that
he
was
piqued
and
proud
she
addressed
a
long
speech
to
him
full
of
endearments
to
win
him
back
to
a
good
humour
and
was
growing
astonished
at
her
own
eloquence
when
in
the
middle
of
it
she
awoke
her
last
words
seemed
to
mingle
with
the
sound
of
familiar
voices
she
sprang
out
of
bed
and
drew
her
curtain
it
was
very
strange
as
the
sunlight
poured
in
she
saw
that
she
was
in
a
room
much
more
poorly
furnished
than
that
in
which
she
had
fallen
asleep
she
dressed
in
haste
and
opening
the
door
found
that
the
next
room
too
was
like
no
apartment
in
the
palace
but
at
her
feet
stood
the
four
chests
she
had
packed
overnight
and
while
she
marvelled
again
she
heard
a
voice
talking
and
ran
towards
it
for
it
was
her
father
she
rushed
out
and
fell
into
his
arms
he
poor
man
stared
at
her
as
though
she
had
sprung
from
another
world
and
the
others
were
no
less
astonished
her
brothers
embraced
her
with
transports
of
joy
while
her
sisters
who
to
tell
the
truth
had
not
overcome
their
jealousy
pretended
to
be
quite
as
glad
they
plied
her
with
a
thousand
questions
which
she
answered
very
putting
aside
her
own
impatience
for
she
too
had
a
number
of
questions
to
ask
to
begin
with
this
house
of
theirs
was
not
the
cottage
in
which
she
had
left
them
but
a
fine
new
one
her
father
had
been
able
to
buy
with
the
presents
if
not
wealthy
he
was
in
easy
circumstances
with
the
bettering
of
their
fortunes
his
sisters
had
found
other
wooers
and
were
soon
to
be
married
and
altogether
had
the
satisfaction
of
knowing
that
she
had
at
least
brought
prosperity
back
to
her
family
for
you
my
dearest
child
said
the
merchant
your
sisters
are
married
you
shall
keep
house
for
your
brothers
and
me
and
so
my
old
age
will
be
happy
this
was
all
very
well
but
had
to
tell
her
father
that
she
must
leave
him
again
in
two
months
time
whereat
he
broke
out
into
lamentations
father
said
the
sensible
girl
is
good
of
you
to
weep
but
it
is
useless
and
i
would
rather
have
your
advice
which
is
sure
to
be
useful
thereupon
she
told
him
all
the
story
her
father
considered
for
a
while
and
then
said
can
only
give
you
the
same
counsel
that
by
your
own
admission
you
are
always
receiving
from
these
phantoms
of
your
dreams
do
not
trust
to
appearance
they
say
and
be
guided
by
your
heart
gratitude
and
they
tell
you
this
over
and
over
again
what
can
it
mean
child
but
one
thing
the
you
say
is
frightful
his
appearance
is
certainly
against
him
then
judge
him
rather
by
the
gratitude
which
you
certainly
owe
him
it
is
plain
that
he
has
a
good
heart
handsome
is
as
handsome
does
it
is
clear
to
me
that
these
phantoms
would
have
you
say
yes
to
the
and
i
too
advise
you
to
consent
saw
the
wisdom
of
this
and
knew
very
well
that
her
father
was
counselling
her
for
the
best
nevertheless
it
needed
something
more
than
this
to
reconcile
her
with
marrying
a
monster
and
she
felt
relieved
at
the
thought
that
for
two
whole
months
she
could
put
off
deciding
strange
to
say
as
the
days
went
by
and
the
time
of
her
departure
drew
nearer
she
found
herself
looking
forward
to
it
rather
than
repining
for
one
thing
distressed
her
and
spoilt
all
her
happiness
she
never
dreamed
at
all
now
the
days
went
by
and
as
they
drew
to
an
end
her
brothers
and
even
her
father
forgetting
his
former
good
counsel
employed
all
persuasions
to
hinder
her
departure
but
her
mind
was
made
up
and
when
the
two
months
were
passed
she
was
resolute
on
everything
but
the
hour
of
her
parting
every
morning
when
she
got
up
she
meant
to
say
but
somehow
another
night
came
and
the
farewells
were
still
unspoken
she
reproached
herself
as
well
she
might
and
was
still
thus
cruelly
torn
between
two
minds
when
one
night
a
dream
visited
her
the
first
for
two
months
and
more
she
dreamed
that
she
was
back
at
the
palace
and
wandering
by
a
lonely
path
in
the
gardens
which
ended
in
a
tangle
of
brushwood
overhanging
a
cave
as
she
drew
nearer
she
heard
a
terrible
groaning
and
running
in
haste
she
found
the
stretched
there
on
the
point
of
death
still
in
her
dream
she
was
bending
over
him
when
the
stately
lady
stepped
forth
from
the
bushes
and
addressed
her
in
a
tone
of
grave
reproach
doubt
if
even
now
you
have
come
in
time
cruel
cruel
of
you
to
delay
when
your
delay
has
brought
him
so
near
to
death
terrified
by
this
dream
awoke
in
her
bed
with
a
start
have
done
wickedly
she
cried
i
too
late
oh
indeed
i
hope
not
she
turned
the
ring
upon
her
finger
and
said
aloud
in
a
firm
voice
wish
to
go
back
to
my
palace
and
see
my
beast
again
with
that
she
at
once
fell
asleep
and
only
woke
up
to
hear
the
clock
chiming
beauty
twelve
times
on
the
musical
note
she
so
well
remembered
she
was
back
then
at
the
palace
yes
and
oh
joy
her
faithful
apes
and
parrots
were
gathered
around
the
bed
wishing
her
good
morning
but
none
of
them
could
tell
her
any
news
of
the
they
were
here
to
serve
her
and
all
their
thoughts
ended
with
their
duty
their
good
master
the
lord
of
this
splendid
palace
what
was
he
to
them
at
any
rate
nothing
was
to
be
learnt
from
them
and
was
no
sooner
dressed
than
she
broke
away
impatiently
wandering
through
the
house
and
the
gardens
to
fill
up
the
time
until
evening
should
bring
his
accustomed
visit
but
it
was
hard
work
filling
up
the
time
she
went
into
the
great
hall
and
resolutely
opened
the
windows
one
by
one
the
shows
were
there
as
before
but
opera
and
comedy
fête
and
pageant
held
no
meaning
for
her
the
players
were
listless
the
music
was
null
the
processions
passed
before
her
eyes
but
had
lost
their
power
to
amuse
came
at
length
but
when
after
supper
the
minutes
passed
and
passed
and
still
no
appeared
then
indeed
was
frightened
for
a
long
while
she
waited
listened
told
herself
this
and
that
and
finally
in
a
terror
rushed
down
into
the
gardens
to
seek
for
him
the
alleys
were
dark
the
bushes
daunted
her
with
their
black
shadows
but
still
up
and
down
ran
poor
calling
to
the
and
calling
in
vain
she
was
drenched
with
the
dew
utterly
lost
and
weary
when
after
three
hours
pausing
for
a
moment
rest
she
saw
before
her
the
same
solitary
path
she
had
seen
in
her
dream
and
there
in
the
moonlight
she
almost
stumbled
over
the
he
lay
there
stretched
at
full
length
and
asleep
or
so
she
thought
so
glad
was
she
to
have
found
him
that
she
knelt
and
stroked
his
head
calling
him
by
name
over
and
over
but
his
flesh
was
cold
beneath
her
hand
nor
did
he
move
or
open
his
eyes
he
is
dead
she
cried
aghast
but
she
put
a
hand
over
his
heart
and
to
her
inexpressible
joy
she
felt
that
it
was
still
beating
hastily
she
ran
to
a
fountain
near
by
and
dipping
water
into
her
palms
from
its
basin
she
ran
and
sprinkled
it
on
his
face
coaxing
him
with
tender
words
as
his
eyes
opened
and
slowly
very
slowly
he
came
to
himself
what
a
fright
you
have
given
me
she
murmured
i
never
knew
how
i
loved
you
until
i
feared
that
you
were
dead
yes
dead
and
through
my
fault
but
i
believe
if
you
had
died
i
should
have
died
too
said
the
faintly
are
very
good
if
indeed
you
can
love
such
an
ugly
brute
as
i
am
it
is
true
that
i
was
dying
for
you
and
should
have
died
if
you
had
not
come
i
thought
you
had
forsaken
me
but
are
you
sure
of
what
asked
you
love
me
us
go
back
to
supper
said
raising
his
head
let
us
go
back
to
supper
the
lifting
himself
heavily
on
her
arm
he
still
leaned
on
her
as
they
walked
back
to
the
palace
together
but
the
supper
which
they
found
laid
for
two
seemed
to
revive
him
and
in
his
old
stupid
way
he
asked
her
about
the
time
she
had
spent
at
home
and
if
her
father
and
brothers
and
sisters
had
been
glad
to
see
her
though
weary
enough
after
her
search
through
the
park
and
gardens
brisked
herself
up
to
tell
of
all
that
had
happened
to
her
in
her
absence
the
sat
nodding
his
head
and
listening
in
his
old
dull
way
which
somehow
seemed
to
her
the
most
comfortable
way
in
the
world
at
length
he
rose
to
go
but
at
the
doorway
he
put
the
old
blunt
question
will
you
marry
me
dear
said
and
as
she
said
it
a
blaze
of
light
filled
the
room
a
salvo
of
artillery
sounded
a
moment
later
from
the
park
bang
bang
fireworks
shot
across
the
windows
of
the
palace
sky
rockets
and
roman
candles
exploded
and
a
magnificent
wrote
across
the
darkness
in
letters
of
fire
live
beauty
and
the
beast
turned
to
ask
what
all
these
rejoicings
might
mean
and
with
that
she
gave
a
cry
the
had
vanished
and
in
his
place
stood
the
beloved
of
her
dreams
he
smiled
and
stretched
out
his
hands
to
her
scarcely
knowing
what
she
did
she
was
stretching
hers
to
take
them
when
above
the
banging
of
fireworks
in
the
avenues
there
sounded
a
rolling
of
wheels
it
drew
to
the
porch
and
presently
there
entered
the
stately
lady
she
had
seen
in
her
dreams
it
was
the
very
same
and
all
astounded
as
she
was
did
reverence
to
her
but
the
stately
lady
was
as
eager
to
do
reverence
to
and
dearest
said
she
son
is
going
to
love
you
always
as
how
should
he
not
seeing
that
by
your
courage
you
have
rescued
him
from
the
enchantment
under
which
he
has
lain
so
long
and
have
restored
him
to
his
natural
form
but
suffer
also
his
mother
a
queen
to
bless
you
turned
again
to
her
lover
and
saw
that
he
who
had
been
a
was
indeed
the
of
her
dreams
and
handsomer
than
the
day
so
they
were
married
and
lived
happy
ever
after
nay
so
happy
were
they
that
all
over
the
world
folks
told
one
another
and
set
down
in
writing
this
wonderful
history
of
and
the
moral
from
this
tale
beauty
and
in
your
memory
write
leads
a
path
of
the
garden
of
delight
the
loveliest
roses
thorns
for
you

another
