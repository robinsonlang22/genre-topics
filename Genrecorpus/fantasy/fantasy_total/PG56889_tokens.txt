penfield
twirled
the
stem
of
his
between
thumb
and
finger
i
don
t
agree
he
said
it
s
nothing
but
egocentric
vanity
to
consider
our
form
of
life
as
unique
among
those
on
the
millions
of
worlds
that
must
how
do
you
know
they
exist
said
hodge
observation
said
mccall
the
astronomers
have
proved
that
other
stars
beside
our
sun
have
you
re
playing
into
his
hands
observed
penfield
the
heavy
eyebrows
twitching
as
he
cracked
a
nut
the
statistical
approach
is
better
why
doesn
t
this
glass
of
port
suddenly
boil
and
spout
all
over
the
ceiling
you
ve
never
seen
a
glass
of
port
behave
that
way
but
the
molecules
that
compose
it
are
in
constant
motion
and
any
physicist
will
tell
you
that
there
s
no
reason
why
they
can
t
all
decide
to
move
in
the
same
direction
at
once
there
s
only
an
overwhelming
possibility
that
it
won
t
happen
to
believe
that
we
on
this
earth
one
of
the
planets
of
a
minor
star
are
the
only
form
of
intelligent
life
is
like
expecting
the
port
to
boil
any
there
are
a
good
many
possibilities
for
intelligent
life
though
said
mccall
some
swede
who
wrote
in
think
his
name
was
looked
into
the
list
he
says
for
instance
that
a
cycle
would
maintain
life
quite
as
well
as
the
system
this
planet
has
and
there
s
no
particular
reason
why
nature
should
favor
one
form
more
than
the
other
oxygen
is
a
very
active
element
to
be
floating
around
free
in
such
quantities
as
we
have
all
right
said
hodge
can
t
it
be
that
the
cycle
you
mention
is
the
normal
one
and
ours
is
the
eccentricity
look
here
said
penfield
what
in
the
world
is
the
point
you
re
making
pass
the
port
and
let
s
review
the
he
leaned
back
in
his
chair
and
gazed
toward
the
top
of
the
room
where
the
carved
coats
of
arms
burned
dully
at
the
top
of
the
dark
panelling
i
don
t
mean
that
everything
here
is
reproduced
exactly
somewhere
else
in
the
universe
with
three
men
named
hodge
mccall
and
penfield
sitting
down
to
discuss
sophomore
philosophy
after
a
sound
dinner
the
fact
that
we
are
here
and
under
these
circumstances
is
the
sum
of
all
the
past
history
hodge
laughed
i
find
the
picture
of
us
three
as
the
crown
of
human
history
an
arresting
one
he
said
you
re
confusing
two
different
things
i
didn
t
say
we
were
elegant
creatures
or
even
desirable
ones
but
behind
us
there
are
certain
circumstances
each
one
of
which
is
as
unlikely
as
the
boiling
port
for
example
the
occurrence
of
such
persons
as
beethoven
george
washington
and
the
man
who
invented
the
wheel
they
are
part
of
our
background
on
one
of
the
other
worlds
that
started
approximately
as
ours
did
they
wouldn
t
exist
and
the
world
would
be
altered
by
that
it
seems
to
me
said
mccall
that
once
you
accept
the
idea
of
worlds
starting
from
approximately
the
same
is
another
planet
having
the
same
size
and
chemical
makeup
and
about
the
same
distance
from
its
that
s
what
i
find
hard
to
accept
said
hodge
grant
us
our
folly
for
a
moment
said
mccall
it
leads
to
something
more
interesting
than
chasing
our
he
snapped
his
lighter
what
i
was
saying
is
that
if
you
grant
approximately
the
same
start
you
re
going
to
arrive
at
approximately
the
same
end
in
spite
of
what
penfield
thinks
we
have
evidence
of
that
right
on
this
earth
i
mean
what
they
call
convergent
evolution
when
the
reptiles
were
dominant
they
produced
and
carnivores
that
fed
on
them
and
among
the
early
mammals
there
were
animals
that
looked
so
much
like
cats
and
wolves
that
the
only
way
to
tell
them
apart
is
by
the
skeleton
why
couldn
t
that
apply
to
human
evolution
too
you
mean
said
penfield
that
beethoven
and
george
washington
would
be
inevitable
not
that
exactly
said
mccall
but
some
kind
of
musical
inventor
and
some
sort
of
military
and
political
leader
there
might
be
hodge
said
wait
a
minute
if
we
are
the
product
of
human
history
so
were
beethoven
and
washington
all
you
ve
got
is
a
determinism
with
nothing
really
alterable
once
the
sun
decided
to
cast
off
its
the
doctrine
of
free
began
mccall
i
know
that
one
said
penfield
but
if
you
deny
free
will
completely
you
ll
end
up
with
a
universe
in
which
every
world
like
ours
is
is
as
absurd
as
hodge
s
picture
of
us
is
unique
and
rather
more
well
then
said
hodge
what
kind
of
cosmology
are
you
putting
out
if
you
won
t
have
either
of
our
pictures
give
us
penfield
sipped
port
i
can
only
suggest
a
sample
he
said
let
s
suppose
this
one
very
like
one
of
those
improbable
accidents
left
out
somewhere
along
the
line
i
mentioned
the
wheel
a
moment
ago
what
would
life
be
like
now
if
it
hadn
t
been
invented
ask
mccall
said
hodge
he
s
the
not
the
wheel
no
said
mccall
i
can
t
buy
that
it
s
too
logical
a
product
of
the
environment
happens
as
soon
as
a
primitive
man
perceives
that
a
section
of
will
roll
no
if
you
re
going
to
make
a
supposition
you
ll
have
to
keep
it
clean
and
think
in
terms
of
something
that
really
might
not
have
happened
for
example
music
there
are
lots
of
peoples
right
here
who
never
found
the
full
chromatic
scale
including
the
classical
civilizations
but
i
suppose
that
s
not
basic
enough
for
for
a
moment
or
two
the
three
sipped
and
smoked
in
the
unspoken
communication
of
friendship
a
log
collapsed
in
the
fireplace
throwing
out
a
spray
of
sparks
mccall
said
the
steam
engine
is
a
rather
unlikely
invention
when
you
come
to
think
of
it
and
most
modern
machines
and
their
products
are
outgrowths
of
it
in
one
way
or
another
but
i
can
think
of
one
more
peculiar
and
more
basic
than
that
oh
come
said
hodge
that
s
a
no
it
isn
t
said
penfield
he
s
perfectly
right
gunpowder
destroyed
the
feudal
system
and
produced
the
atmosphere
in
which
your
steam
engine
became
possible
and
remember
that
all
the
older
civilizations
even
in
the
east
were
subject
to
periodic
setbacks
by
barbarian
invasions
gunpowder
provided
civilized
man
with
a
technique
no
barbarian
could
imitate
and
helped
him
over
the
difficult
mccall
said
all
the
techniques
and
most
of
chemistry
depend
on
the
use
of
imagine
digging
out
all
the
ores
we
need
by
all
right
then
said
hodge
have
your
fun
let
s
imagine
a
world
like
this
one
in
which
gunpowder
has
never
been
invented
what
are
you
going
to
have
it
look
like
i
don
t
know
said
mccall
but
i
think
penfield
s
wrong
about
one
point
about
the
feudal
system
i
mean
it
was
pretty
shaky
toward
the
end
and
the
cannon
that
battered
down
the
castles
only
hurried
up
the
process
there
might
be
a
lot
more
pieces
of
the
feudal
system
hanging
around
without
gunpowder
but
the
thing
would
be
pretty
well
now
look
here
said
hodge
you
ve
overlooked
something
else
if
you
re
going
to
eliminate
gunpowder
and
everything
that
came
out
of
it
you
ll
have
to
replace
it
with
something
after
all
a
large
part
of
the
time
and
attention
of
our
civilization
have
been
spent
in
working
out
the
results
of
the
gunpowder
and
steam
engine
inventions
if
you
take
those
away
you
ll
have
a
vacuum
which
i
m
told
nature
abhors
there
would
have
to
be
a
corresponding
development
in
some
other
field
going
way
beyond
where
we
penfield
drank
and
nodded
that
s
fair
he
said
a
development
along
some
line
we
ve
neglected
because
we
have
been
too
busy
with
mechanics
why
couldn
t
it
be
in
the
region
of
esp
or
psychology
or
of
the
mind
but
the
psychologists
are
just
operating
on
the
ordinary
principles
of
physical
science
said
mccall
observing
verifying
from
a
number
of
examples
and
then
attempting
to
predict
i
don
t
see
how
another
race
would
have
gone
farther
by
being
ignorant
of
these
principles
or
overlooking
you
re
being
insular
said
penfield
i
don
t
mean
that
in
another
world
they
would
have
turned
psychology
into
an
exact
science
in
our
terms
it
might
be
something
altogether
different
your
principles
of
science
are
developed
along
the
lines
of
arithmetic
the
reason
they
haven
t
worked
very
well
in
dealing
with
the
human
mind
may
be
because
they
aren
t
applicable
at
all
there
may
be
quite
a
different
line
of
approach
think
it
over
for
a
moment
it
might
even
be
along
the
line
of
magic
i
like
that
said
mccall
you
want
to
make
a
difference
by
substituting
something
phoney
for
something
but
it
might
not
be
phoney
insisted
penfield
magic
and
witchcraft
are
really
pretty
late
in
our
world
they
began
to
be
talked
about
at
the
same
time
and
on
the
same
terms
as
alchemy
everything
surrounded
by
superstition
lying
and
plain
ignorance
in
this
world
we
re
imagining
somebody
might
have
found
the
key
to
something
as
basic
in
that
field
as
gunpowder
was
to
the
physical
sciences
some
people
say
we
almost
made
the
discovery
here
you
know
the
story
about
this
house
mccall
nodded
but
hodge
said
no
what
is
it
another
ghost
story
not
quite
the
old
part
of
the
house
the
one
where
the
bedrooms
are
now
is
supposed
to
have
been
built
by
one
of
the
salem
witches
not
one
of
those
they
hanged
on
false
charges
but
a
perfectly
genuine
witch
who
got
away
before
she
was
a
real
witch
probably
would
the
story
is
that
she
came
here
and
set
up
business
among
the
indians
and
as
they
weren
t
very
expert
at
carpentry
she
helped
them
build
that
part
of
the
house
with
spells
so
it
would
be
eternal
the
old
beams
haven
t
a
bit
of
iron
in
them
they
re
all
held
together
with
pegs
and
haven
t
rotted
a
bit
there
s
also
a
story
that
if
you
make
the
proper
preparations
at
night
something
beyond
the
normal
will
happen
i
ve
never
done
the
right
thing
myself
you
probably
won
t
said
hodge
the
essence
of
the
whole
witchcraft
business
is
uncertainty
haven
t
you
noticed
that
in
all
the
legends
the
spells
never
quite
come
off
when
they
re
needed
that
s
probably
because
there
isn
t
any
science
of
witchcraft
with
predictable
results
said
mccall
penfield
said
it
may
be
for
another
reason
too
have
you
ever
noticed
that
magic
is
the
only
form
of
human
activity
which
is
dominated
by
women
the
really
scary
creatures
are
all
witches
when
a
man
becomes
a
magician
he
s
either
possessed
of
a
devil
or
is
a
glorified
juggler
our
theoretical
world
would
have
to
start
by
being
a
or
contain
the
relics
of
one
said
hodge
matriarchies
are
socially
so
is
everything
said
mccall
flow
and
change
from
one
form
to
another
is
a
characteristic
of
maybe
a
definition
of
life
that
goes
for
your
witchcraft
too
it
would
change
form
there
d
be
resistance
to
it
and
an
effort
to
find
something
to
replace
or
to
remove
the
disabilities
said
hodge
the
difficulty
with
any
power
we
don
t
really
know
about
is
not
to
define
the
power
itself
but
to
discover
its
limitations
if
witchcraft
were
really
practical
there
would
be
some
fairly
severe
penalties
going
with
it
not
legally
i
mean
but
personally
as
a
result
of
the
practice
or
to
put
the
thing
in
your
terms
mccall
if
there
weren
t
any
drawbacks
being
a
witch
would
have
such
high
selection
value
that
before
long
every
female
alive
would
be
a
practicing
mccall
carefully
poured
more
port
hodge
he
said
you
re
wonderful
and
i
love
you
but
that
s
typical
of
the
way
you
put
things
you
cover
up
a
weak
point
by
following
it
with
one
that
attracts
everyone
s
attention
away
from
the
feebleness
of
your
real
case
penalties
for
everything
what
s
the
penalty
for
having
an
electric
icebox
a
pampered
digestive
system
said
hodge
readily
i
doubt
whether
you
could
survive
the
food
queen
elizabeth
ate
for
very
long
but
she
lived
to
be
well
over
sixty
if
there
were
witchcraft
or
esp
or
telepathy
running
around
in
the
world
there
couldn
t
but
be
defenses
against
it
and
troubles
for
the
practitioners
had
it
occurred
to
you
that
even
a
witch
couldn
t
spend
all
her
time
stirring
cauldrons
and
might
want
to
lead
a
normal
life
with
a
husband
and
children
penfield
got
up
and
stepped
to
the
window
where
he
stood
looking
out
and
down
at
the
midnight
atlantic
throwing
its
surges
against
the
breast
of
the
rocks
i
wonder
if
it
really
does
exist
he
said
hodge
laughed
but
that
night
all
three
men
dreamed
and
it
was
as
though
a
filament
ran
through
the
ancient
rooms
for
each
knew
that
he
dreamed
and
dreamed
the
same
dream
as
the
others
and
from
time
to
time
tried
to
cry
out
to
them
but
could
only
see
and
hear
netznegon
city
march
rain
it
was
raining
steadily
outside
the
older
woman
s
tears
and
words
fell
in
time
drip
drip
cold
for
the
tall
window
at
the
room
s
end
would
never
quite
shut
close
bottom
and
top
not
nest
into
the
frame
simultaneously
lalette
in
her
soutane
felt
and
tried
to
shut
out
the
sound
by
thinking
of
a
man
with
a
green
hat
who
would
give
her
a
handful
of
gold
scudi
and
nothing
asked
merely
because
it
was
spring
and
she
put
a
small
spell
on
him
with
a
smile
but
it
was
not
quite
spring
and
the
voice
persisted
all
my
have
and
planned
for
before
you
were
before
you
were
of
my
yes
thought
lalette
i
have
heard
that
before
and
it
would
move
me
more
but
the
night
you
drank
the
wine
with
dame
carabobo
you
told
her
how
i
was
the
product
of
a
chance
union
in
a
carriage
between
rushaca
and
zenss
after
i
saved
and
worked
so
miss
the
only
only
t
know
what
i
m
going
to
count
cleudi
s
not
like
you
told
him
what
he
offered
was
frightful
i
heard
sob
it
was
oh
it
was
oh
lalette
it
isn
t
right
you
should
be
married
with
a
gold
coach
and
six
what
can
we
do
if
your
father
had
left
us
anything
before
the
i
sacrificed
for
that
is
what
all
of
us
must
do
make
sacrifices
we
can
t
have
anything
real
without
giving
something
away
lalette
you
will
be
able
to
employ
the
art
and
have
everything
you
want
you
know
most
of
the
patterns
already
he
does
not
go
to
the
service
often
and
after
all
it
s
something
that
happens
to
every
woman
one
way
or
another
and
with
the
art
even
if
he
doesn
t
marry
you
he
ll
find
you
a
husband
you
won
t
mind
it
s
only
men
like
cleudi
who
want
to
be
the
first
a
man
who
marries
would
really
prefer
a
girl
to
have
a
little
experience
i
know
lalette
lalette
did
not
answer
all
the
young
ones
come
to
the
ball
after
the
opera
lalette
count
cleudi
will
present
you
and
even
if
you
don
t
he
would
have
not
only
a
green
hat
but
lace
at
wrist
and
throat
and
a
man
who
spoke
in
a
mayern
accent
thick
as
cream
and
carried
the
purse
because
it
spoiled
the
as
though
he
were
just
one
of
those
so
considerate
i
suppose
we
can
not
control
how
we
come
by
our
parents
your
father
like
an
angel
out
of
heaven
and
i
could
have
taught
you
so
much
more
if
now
she
is
in
the
past
again
i
m
going
to
hear
it
all
over
really
for
it
is
more
like
one
step
up
than
a
leap
down
from
a
high
place
which
is
always
what
we
think
before
the
first
time
lalette
yes
someone
knocked
at
the
door
lalette
s
mother
hastily
daubed
at
her
cheeks
heaved
herself
heavily
from
the
chair
looked
sidewise
saying
we
could
sell
the
but
before
the
girl
could
reply
the
tap
again
the
older
woman
waddled
across
to
the
door
and
opened
it
a
crack
a
long
jaw
and
long
nose
under
a
wet
hat
poked
in
i
was
just
saying
to
my
began
dame
leonalda
a
pair
of
thin
shoulders
pushed
past
her
as
though
not
hearing
the
man
stood
in
the
center
of
the
room
sniffed
and
wiped
his
nose
on
his
sleeve
listen
he
said
no
more
stories
i
have
heard
too
dame
leonalda
gave
him
a
doleful
look
and
bustled
back
to
her
seat
but
i
assure
you
ser
no
more
stories
he
said
again
i
have
charges
to
meet
and
she
put
her
hands
to
her
face
lalette
thought
her
only
device
i
hope
i
shall
not
grow
like
that
ruald
said
but
i
do
not
wish
to
be
hard
no
and
i
know
you
have
no
money
just
now
so
i
will
be
fair
and
if
you
render
me
a
small
service
why
then
it
is
not
beyond
me
to
forgive
the
whole
four
months
dame
leonalda
took
down
her
hands
again
and
said
what
is
the
service
her
voice
had
something
like
a
tinge
of
dread
ruald
sniffed
again
darted
a
glance
at
lalette
another
at
the
door
and
stepped
close
i
have
heard
that
you
belong
to
one
of
the
families
of
the
blue
who
told
you
that
it
does
not
matter
is
it
true
the
dame
s
lips
worked
and
what
if
it
is
why
this
dame
it
will
not
peril
your
soul
to
place
a
small
no
no
i
couldn
t
do
such
a
thing
you
have
no
right
to
ask
the
man
s
face
sneered
i
have
a
right
to
ask
you
for
my
money
no
no
i
tell
her
hands
waved
the
air
that
dame
sauglitz
they
punished
her
with
five
years
and
they
will
punish
nobody
for
this
utterly
private
between
you
and
myself
is
not
your
skill
enough
so
that
no
suspicion
of
witchery
will
fall
on
you
come
i
ll
do
better
i
ll
more
than
forgive
the
arrears
i
ll
give
you
for
four
other
months
to
mother
said
lalette
from
the
corner
dame
leonalda
turned
around
this
does
not
concern
you
she
said
and
to
ruald
but
how
am
i
to
know
that
having
done
as
you
wish
you
ll
not
denounce
me
before
the
episcopals
why
as
for
that
might
i
not
want
your
help
another
time
she
put
up
a
protesting
hand
but
he
come
no
more
stories
i
there
was
another
tap
at
the
door
ruald
looked
annoyance
as
dame
leonalda
crossed
the
room
in
another
rustle
of
skirts
her
voice
was
almost
gay
come
in
uncle
rain
shook
shining
from
his
cloak
ah
charming
dame
the
paunch
hindered
his
bow
the
greetings
of
the
evening
to
you
ser
ruald
why
this
is
a
true
evening
i
was
just
leaving
said
ruald
tugging
at
his
jacket
well
then
dame
leonalda
bear
in
mind
what
i
have
said
i
m
sure
we
ll
reach
she
did
not
get
up
as
he
went
when
the
door
was
closed
she
turned
to
uncle
bontembi
it
is
such
a
problem
dear
uncle
she
said
of
course
the
child
is
perfectly
right
in
a
way
and
it
would
be
different
if
her
father
had
left
her
anything
at
all
but
with
such
a
man
as
the
count
is
a
splendid
gentleman
said
the
priest
i
have
seen
him
lose
fifty
gold
scudi
on
a
turn
but
never
his
composure
and
he
is
in
high
favor
is
there
a
problem
relative
to
him
not
that
his
eye
has
fallen
on
our
little
lalette
i
would
call
that
a
matter
for
consent
and
ah
uncle
it
is
this
if
men
only
behaved
as
nobly
toward
women
as
they
do
to
each
other
he
has
set
his
eye
on
this
dear
child
indeed
but
not
his
hand
and
says
he
will
pay
all
our
debts
and
give
her
a
hundred
gold
scudi
besides
if
she
will
only
accompany
him
to
the
opera
and
ball
of
the
spring
uncle
bontembi
plucked
at
the
button
of
his
chin
and
the
smile
left
his
face
hm
hm
it
is
certainly
on
the
face
of
matters
a
proposal
you
are
certain
you
have
not
been
employing
the
art
dame
leonalda
oh
no
never
never
and
my
dear
little
girl
how
could
she
the
priest
glanced
at
the
girl
yes
yes
she
has
her
first
confession
to
make
well
well
let
us
think
this
out
together
i
will
say
the
count
cleudi
is
highly
held
in
other
circles
beside
the
political
there
was
some
theological
discussion
at
the
palace
bregatz
lately
and
the
episcopal
was
of
the
opinion
that
he
had
never
heard
sounder
doctrine
or
better
put
than
by
cleudi
wherefore
he
can
not
be
very
far
from
the
laws
of
the
good
god
and
right
moral
can
he
and
so
his
plan
may
be
of
greater
benefit
than
first
i
do
not
want
such
benefits
said
lalette
but
thought
then
i
should
have
the
art
oho
our
junior
niece
resists
this
is
not
the
true
humility
come
demoiselle
lalette
let
us
look
at
it
this
way
we
can
only
truly
serve
good
and
vanquish
the
eternal
forces
of
evil
through
the
happiness
of
others
for
if
it
is
our
own
happiness
we
seek
then
others
doing
the
same
will
make
all
unhappy
and
so
give
victory
to
he
signed
himself
thus
to
bring
joy
to
others
is
the
true
service
of
religion
and
moral
no
matter
what
the
appearance
may
say
now
in
this
case
there
would
be
three
people
given
happiness
yes
yes
the
doctrinal
point
is
somewhat
delicate
but
i
can
not
find
it
in
my
mind
to
disapprove
there
is
a
technical
violation
of
moral
law
involved
and
i
am
afraid
the
church
will
have
to
assess
a
certain
fine
against
you
but
i
will
make
it
as
light
as
possible
enough
to
remind
that
a
good
action
should
be
done
for
moral
gain
and
not
i
do
not
love
him
said
lalette
all
the
more
unselfish
all
the
the
priest
turned
to
dame
leonalda
have
you
not
made
it
clear
to
our
niece
that
the
true
love
which
puts
down
evil
in
the
name
of
the
major
glory
of
god
is
something
that
rises
out
of
and
after
union
why
if
she
talks
so
i
will
have
to
lay
on
her
for
approaching
the
doctrines
of
the
oh
i
have
told
her
i
have
told
the
mother
s
voice
began
to
cloud
toward
another
rain
of
tears
but
she
is
so
romantical
and
sensitive
my
little
daughter
just
like
those
poems
by
terquid
when
i
was
a
lalette
let
her
face
smooth
out
as
she
thought
about
the
opera
ball
and
what
it
would
be
like
but
even
that
was
not
much
use
their
voices
kept
picking
at
her
until
she
went
behind
the
curtain
to
her
bed
in
the
corner
where
it
was
even
colder
beneath
the
blanket
at
first
so
that
she
curled
up
tight
if
i
were
really
married
the
blue
star
would
belong
to
me
and
my
husband
and
ii
but
is
it
a
genuine
blue
star
asked
pyax
he
turned
toward
remigorius
who
should
know
if
anyone
ah
of
that
i
can
not
say
we
have
been
deceived
before
it
is
certain
that
the
old
woman
has
practised
veritable
witcheries
the
center
of
veierelden
found
a
record
of
a
conviction
against
her
in
the
church
there
the
only
surety
is
in
the
test
and
that
is
a
test
that
only
friend
rodvard
here
can
make
if
it
should
be
genuine
our
game
s
the
lower
lip
of
pyax
hung
open
among
his
pimples
and
mme
kaja
s
ravaged
face
changed
line
it
would
be
to
have
it
she
said
drawing
out
the
long
sound
and
rodvard
felt
the
blood
run
warm
beneath
his
skin
as
they
all
looked
at
him
but
i
do
not
think
her
mother
would
permit
a
marriage
he
said
how
will
you
have
me
do
do
do
said
the
doctor
the
little
white
planes
at
the
corners
of
his
mouth
shining
against
the
black
fantastic
cut
of
his
beard
shall
we
school
hens
to
lay
eggs
or
rats
to
suck
them
for
you
do
what
is
most
natural
for
a
lad
with
a
willing
girl
in
his
arms
and
the
blue
star
is
ours
will
you
have
mme
kaja
to
teach
you
the
flush
warmed
rodvard
and
he
said
mathurin
in
the
background
opened
his
thin
tight
lips
our
friend
is
lapped
in
the
obligation
of
the
church
hey
rodvard
what
moral
do
you
follow
if
it
s
to
be
that
of
the
priests
you
have
no
place
with
us
you
are
engaged
as
a
soldier
to
the
overthrow
of
all
they
stand
you
are
so
wrong
friend
mathurin
said
mme
kaja
i
understand
there
is
the
she
pressed
a
hand
to
a
pendulous
right
breast
as
my
old
friend
the
baroness
blenau
used
to
say
hearts
do
not
guide
but
to
sorrow
ah
friend
rodvard
believe
me
if
one
is
to
have
the
great
peace
one
must
deny
the
heart
s
message
and
seek
the
good
of
all
beyond
what
gives
pain
at
the
she
slapped
her
breast
again
and
turned
to
the
others
i
know
he
is
in
love
with
without
reason
mathurin
said
suddenly
when
i
went
to
the
court
service
with
cleudi
last
night
the
old
hog
was
drunk
again
fell
on
the
floor
at
her
royal
prayers
and
had
to
be
remigorius
will
you
still
distract
us
mathurin
there
is
but
one
present
question
before
this
bidding
of
the
high
center
that
friend
rodvard
here
obtain
the
blue
star
from
lalette
asterhax
can
we
report
to
them
that
the
task
is
undertaken
pyax
spoke
running
his
tongue
across
lips
if
he
will
not
i
can
offer
through
marriage
and
lawful
lease
my
father
would
be
willing
to
give
a
rodvard
burst
into
laughter
with
the
rest
over
the
thought
there
could
be
enough
money
in
the
world
to
buy
a
dossolan
bedding
for
one
of
pyax
zigraner
birth
but
the
laugh
ended
bitterly
for
the
young
man
at
the
thought
that
because
they
could
see
no
better
way
he
must
give
up
his
ideal
of
honor
and
true
love
he
tried
to
imagine
how
it
would
be
to
live
with
someone
who
did
not
love
one
again
but
whom
for
honor
s
sake
he
must
have
married
and
for
a
moment
the
intent
faces
dissolved
away
he
felt
a
momentary
strange
sweet
painful
thrill
before
the
picture
in
his
mind
changed
to
that
of
his
father
and
mother
quarreling
about
money
and
she
began
to
scream
until
his
father
with
contorted
face
reached
down
the
cane
from
the
mantel
oh
if
one
gives
in
love
it
should
be
forever
ever
love
and
place
him
remigorius
was
saying
but
that
will
be
a
matter
for
the
high
center
no
there
s
only
the
one
thing
and
we
ll
have
the
answer
now
rodvard
bergelin
we
summon
you
by
your
oath
to
the
sons
of
the
new
day
and
your
desire
to
overthrow
the
wicked
rule
of
the
laughing
chancellor
and
the
old
queen
to
take
your
pyax
smiled
nastily
remember
peribert
we
know
how
to
deal
with
those
who
fall
it
is
not
good
to
be
hard
on
those
from
whom
you
seek
help
said
mme
kaja
be
still
said
remigorius
young
man
your
one
more
effort
is
it
so
vital
that
we
have
this
jewel
said
rodvard
yes
said
remigorius
simply
but
mathurin
this
is
the
only
true
blue
star
of
which
we
have
record
and
even
this
one
may
not
be
true
but
if
you
will
not
make
the
effort
to
win
it
as
ordered
there
s
still
an
escape
you
are
a
clerk
to
the
office
of
pedigree
find
another
blue
star
that
we
can
have
and
you
re
excused
but
with
matters
so
approaching
a
crisis
at
the
court
we
must
have
one
for
we
are
the
weaker
rodvard
saw
pyax
touch
his
and
once
more
wetly
run
out
his
tongue
so
like
a
lizard
s
beaten
had
he
not
himself
in
those
long
conversations
until
daybreak
maintained
that
among
free
men
the
more
voices
must
make
the
decisions
with
a
sense
that
he
was
assuming
an
obligation
to
baseness
he
said
i
will
do
as
you
remigorius
face
cracked
into
a
smile
pfo
young
man
you
ll
make
a
witch
of
her
and
she
will
gain
her
mme
kaja
came
over
to
take
both
his
hands
as
he
left
the
heart
will
follow
she
said
april
night
lalette
looked
up
through
branches
to
the
purpling
sky
then
down
from
the
little
crest
and
across
the
long
flat
fertile
fields
reaching
out
toward
the
eastern
sea
where
night
was
rising
i
must
go
she
said
my
mother
will
be
back
from
the
her
voice
was
flat
not
yet
said
rodvard
lifting
his
head
from
arms
wrapped
around
his
knees
you
said
she
would
stay
to
talk
with
the
fat
priest
in
this
light
your
eyes
are
it
is
the
sign
of
a
bad
temper
my
mother
tells
me
she
looked
in
the
waters
for
me
once
and
says
that
when
i
am
married
i
will
be
a
frightful
it
was
almost
too
much
trouble
to
move
she
was
glad
even
to
make
a
slender
line
of
conversation
that
would
hold
her
immobile
in
the
calm
twilight
then
you
must
be
fated
to
marry
a
bad
man
i
do
not
you
really
loved
someone
how
could
you
be
shrewish
with
them
oh
the
girls
of
our
heritage
can
not
marry
for
love
it
is
the
tradition
of
the
she
sat
up
suddenly
now
i
must
absolutely
he
placed
his
hand
over
hers
where
it
rested
on
the
long
green
moss
under
the
cedars
absolutely
i
will
not
let
you
go
i
will
bind
you
with
hard
bonds
till
you
tell
me
more
about
your
family
do
you
really
have
a
blue
star
my
mother
does
i
do
not
know
my
father
would
never
use
it
that
is
why
we
are
so
poor
he
said
it
was
wrong
and
dangerous
my
mother
s
father
used
it
though
she
says
before
she
got
it
from
him
it
was
he
who
told
her
to
choose
my
father
he
was
a
capellan
in
the
army
you
know
and
was
killed
in
the
war
at
the
siege
of
sedad
mir
my
mother
s
father
could
read
through
the
star
that
my
father
wanted
my
mother
for
herself
and
not
for
her
heritage
it
was
a
but
now
there
is
no
one
that
can
use
the
lalette
thought
i
really
must
not
tell
stories
like
that
that
are
not
true
it
only
slipped
out
because
i
do
not
wish
to
go
back
and
hear
her
talking
about
count
cleudi
again
could
not
you
sell
it
asked
rodvard
who
would
buy
it
it
would
be
a
confession
that
someone
wanted
to
practice
witchery
and
then
the
priests
would
come
down
and
there
d
be
a
church
trial
it
is
a
very
strange
thing
and
a
burden
to
have
witchery
in
one
s
she
shuddered
a
little
attracted
and
yet
depressed
as
always
when
it
was
a
question
of
that
i
do
not
want
to
be
a
witch
why
i
would
began
rodvard
really
thinking
that
in
spite
of
her
beauty
this
was
the
reason
she
more
than
a
little
repelled
have
people
hating
me
and
those
who
want
to
like
me
not
sure
whether
they
really
do
or
whether
it
is
only
another
witchery
the
only
real
friend
my
mother
has
is
uncle
bontembi
and
that
s
because
he
s
a
priest
and
i
don
t
think
he
s
a
real
friend
either
but
keeps
watch
of
her
so
that
when
she
makes
a
witchery
he
can
collect
another
fine
for
the
rodvard
felt
the
small
hand
clench
beneath
his
own
i
ll
never
marry
and
stay
a
virgin
and
will
not
be
a
witch
what
would
happen
to
the
blue
star
then
you
have
no
sisters
have
you
only
a
brother
and
he
went
overseas
to
mancherei
when
the
prophet
began
to
preach
there
somebody
said
he
went
beyond
to
the
green
isles
afterward
when
the
prophet
left
we
do
not
hear
from
him
any
more
but
he
couldn
t
use
the
blue
star
anyway
unless
he
were
bound
with
a
girl
from
one
of
the
other
families
who
could
witch
it
for
overhead
the
sky
was
deepening
with
one
faint
easterly
star
agleam
a
long
slow
smoke
rose
in
convolutions
from
the
chimney
of
a
cot
down
there
and
rodvard
thought
desperately
of
the
lovely
girl
who
had
come
so
many
times
to
search
records
at
his
clerk
s
cabinet
in
the
office
of
pedigree
but
she
was
a
baron
s
daughter
by
her
badge
and
even
if
he
did
obtain
the
blue
star
from
this
one
and
used
it
to
win
the
girl
then
lalette
would
be
a
witch
and
put
a
spell
on
tangle
the
hand
within
his
stirred
i
must
go
said
lalette
again
he
looks
something
like
cleudi
she
was
thinking
but
not
so
old
and
hard
and
a
little
romantic
and
he
had
eye
enough
to
catch
the
wonderful
tiny
flash
of
green
among
the
blue
when
the
sun
dipped
under
ah
no
you
shall
not
go
not
yet
this
is
a
magic
evening
and
we
will
keep
it
forever
till
all
s
her
face
softened
a
trifle
in
the
fading
light
but
she
pulled
to
withdraw
her
hand
he
clung
the
tighter
feeling
in
the
momentary
small
struggle
what
if
i
will
not
let
you
go
till
and
the
gates
are
closed
then
uncle
bontembi
will
expect
me
to
make
a
confession
and
if
i
do
not
he
will
put
a
fine
on
me
and
it
will
be
bad
for
my
mother
because
we
are
so
but
if
i
kept
you
it
would
be
to
run
away
with
you
ah
far
beyond
the
shining
mountains
and
live
with
you
her
hand
went
passive
again
she
leaned
toward
him
a
trifle
as
though
to
see
more
surely
the
expression
on
his
face
do
you
mean
that
rodvard
bergelin
he
caught
breath
should
i
say
it
else
you
do
not
let
me
go
let
me
go
or
i
ll
make
she
half
turned
trying
to
rise
bringing
the
other
hand
to
help
pull
loose
his
fingers
will
you
witch
me
witch
he
cried
struggling
and
his
grasp
slipped
to
her
wrist
she
snatched
at
the
held
hand
with
the
other
catching
the
thumb
and
crying
fiercely
i
ll
break
my
own
finger
i
swear
it
if
you
do
not
let
no
he
flung
her
two
hands
apart
lithe
as
a
serpent
she
wrung
one
and
then
the
other
from
his
grasp
but
it
was
with
an
effort
that
carried
her
off
balance
and
supine
asprawl
he
rolled
on
his
hip
to
pin
her
down
hands
on
her
elbows
breast
to
breast
and
was
kissing
her
mouth
till
she
stopped
trying
turning
her
face
from
his
and
whispering
let
me
go
it
s
wrong
it
s
i
will
not
and
he
released
one
hand
to
feel
where
the
maddening
sensation
of
her
breast
came
against
him
and
the
laces
began
the
thought
was
fleetingly
seen
in
the
of
his
inner
mind
that
he
did
not
love
her
and
would
have
to
pay
for
this
somehow
let
me
go
she
cried
again
in
a
strangled
voice
and
convulsing
struck
him
on
the
side
of
the
head
with
her
free
hand
at
that
moment
the
laces
gave
her
hand
came
round
his
head
instead
of
against
it
drawing
his
face
down
in
a
long
sobbing
kiss
through
which
a
murmur
softer
than
a
whisper
all
right
oh
all
right
go
there
was
one
little
flash
of
triumph
across
her
mind
one
trouble
solved
cleudi
would
never
want
her
now
afterward
he
knelt
to
kiss
her
her
lips
were
compressed
at
the
center
a
little
raised
at
the
corners
now
i
understand
said
she
but
he
did
not
and
all
the
way
home
was
eaten
by
the
most
dreadful
cold
fear
that
she
would
revenge
herself
on
him
with
a
witchery
that
would
leave
him
stark
idiot
or
smitten
with
dreadful
disease
and
the
other
the
other
his
mind
would
not
form
her
name
and
there
was
a
cry
within
him
ii
all
three
of
them
were
waiting
with
that
man
of
count
cleudi
one
with
such
intense
was
his
name
lalette
curtsied
uncle
bontembi
smiled
said
cleudi
mathurin
the
baskets
i
commenced
to
think
we
should
miss
the
pleasure
of
your
company
tonight
charming
demoiselle
lalette
and
my
heart
was
oh
she
said
if
they
knew
but
here
is
uncle
bontembi
who
will
tell
you
that
to
be
desolate
of
heart
is
to
serve
evil
and
not
true
religion
since
god
wishes
us
to
be
happy
for
since
he
has
created
us
in
his
image
it
must
be
an
image
of
you
reason
like
an
angel
demoiselle
lalette
permit
that
i
salute
she
moved
just
enough
to
make
his
kiss
fall
on
her
cheek
dame
leonalda
simpered
but
there
was
flick
and
gone
again
a
frown
across
cleudi
s
face
what
a
lovely
color
your
daughter
has
mathurin
laid
out
the
table
with
napkins
which
he
unfolded
from
the
baskets
there
were
oysters
packed
in
snow
bubbling
wine
a
pastry
of
truffles
and
small
artichokes
pickled
entire
peaches
that
must
have
come
from
the
south
since
it
was
only
time
in
dossola
white
bread
a
ham
enriched
with
spices
honeyed
small
sweetmeats
of
dwarf
fruit
if
he
were
only
more
to
me
and
less
for
himself
thought
lalette
he
might
be
possible
for
he
does
not
stint
they
sat
down
with
herself
and
her
mother
opposite
each
other
and
the
two
men
at
the
sides
of
the
table
so
small
that
knees
touched
mathurin
the
servant
stood
beside
her
chair
but
flitted
round
to
give
to
the
rest
as
occasion
demanded
cleudi
thousand
things
eating
with
his
left
hand
and
letting
his
right
now
and
again
drop
to
touch
the
fabric
over
lalette
s
leg
which
laughing
with
talk
and
wine
she
did
not
deny
him
an
aura
like
a
perfume
of
virility
and
desire
and
pleasure
emanated
from
him
lalette
felt
as
though
she
were
swaying
slightly
in
her
seat
lalette
asterhax
the
name
has
fifteen
letters
said
cleudi
and
the
sum
of
one
and
five
is
six
which
fails
by
one
the
mystical
number
of
seven
look
also
how
you
may
take
it
by
another
route
l
being
the
twelfth
letter
of
the
alphabet
so
that
to
it
there
is
added
one
for
a
another
twelve
for
the
second
l
and
so
on
the
sum
of
all
being
he
has
prepared
this
in
advance
she
thought
being
itself
summed
up
again
this
is
fifteen
so
it
is
evident
that
you
will
be
incomplete
and
thus
lacking
in
happiness
until
united
with
a
man
who
can
supply
the
missing
i
am
not
sure
that
the
church
would
approve
your
doctrine
said
uncle
bontembi
he
had
moved
his
chair
around
to
place
his
arm
over
the
back
of
dame
leonalda
s
and
she
had
thrown
her
head
back
to
rest
on
the
arm
you
are
clearly
wrong
my
friend
said
cleudi
the
church
itself
takes
cognizance
of
the
power
of
numbers
which
are
the
of
enlistment
under
god
against
evil
rather
than
being
the
protection
itself
as
some
ignorant
persons
would
make
them
look
does
not
the
church
in
dossola
have
seven
episcopals
are
there
not
seven
varieties
of
angels
and
is
it
not
dulcet
to
make
seven
prayers
within
the
period
whereas
it
is
the
heretical
followers
of
the
prophet
who
deny
the
value
of
then
said
lalette
i
must
never
complete
myself
by
union
with
you
for
you
have
five
letters
and
the
seven
of
my
first
name
being
added
to
them
make
twelve
which
is
three
by
your
manner
of
computation
and
an
evil
cleudi
laughed
all
divine
lalette
your
reasoning
is
he
poured
more
wine
for
it
is
clear
that
man
and
woman
are
each
incomplete
by
themselves
not
to
be
completed
until
they
are
united
else
we
were
not
so
formed
now
such
union
is
manifestly
to
the
pleasure
of
god
since
he
arranged
it
thus
so
that
if
anything
prevent
true
union
it
must
be
contrary
to
the
ordinance
of
god
is
this
not
exact
uncle
bontembi
through
dame
leonalda
s
giggle
the
priest
smiled
his
face
curling
in
wrinkles
around
the
fat
your
lordship
lacks
only
the
oath
and
a
drop
of
oil
in
the
palm
to
be
an
episcopal
i
resign
in
your
favor
my
chance
of
but
i
ll
resign
no
chance
of
cleudi
reached
to
squeeze
lalette
s
hand
where
it
lay
on
the
table
a
stroke
of
fortune
i
happened
to
fall
in
with
his
grace
the
chancellor
only
this
morning
he
spoke
of
the
difficulty
in
finance
which
is
such
you
believe
it
is
even
some
question
whether
her
majesty
will
be
able
to
take
her
summer
holiday
in
the
dame
leonalda
raised
her
head
oh
oh
the
disgrace
she
sighed
i
do
not
see
the
stroke
of
fortune
said
lalette
simply
a
disgrace
yes
said
cleudi
his
mobile
face
for
a
moment
morose
but
i
was
happily
able
to
suggest
to
his
grace
that
the
matter
of
taxes
be
placed
in
the
hands
of
the
lords
of
court
themselves
to
be
taxed
an
amount
equal
to
that
due
from
their
seignories
and
they
to
collect
it
within
their
stroke
of
fortune
said
lalette
not
much
interested
as
she
dipped
a
finger
in
the
wine
and
drew
arabesques
on
the
in
the
damp
his
grace
was
so
much
charmed
with
my
plan
that
he
offered
me
a
place
in
the
service
with
the
directorate
of
the
lottery
so
that
i
now
am
happy
enough
to
be
no
more
a
tritulaccan
but
dossolan
by
service
of
he
lifted
his
glass
to
lalette
i
shall
drink
to
your
grey
eyes
and
you
to
my
the
glasses
touched
i
do
wish
you
good
fortune
she
said
what
better
fortune
could
there
be
than
to
have
you
attend
with
me
the
first
of
the
season
and
make
the
drawing
of
the
lottery
as
its
queen
said
uncle
bontembi
in
a
voice
as
rich
as
though
he
were
addressing
a
congregation
spring
is
the
season
most
calculated
to
show
forth
the
victory
of
god
over
evil
and
the
beginning
of
new
growth
and
happiness
not
only
do
we
celebrate
the
return
of
the
sun
but
the
rejection
of
darkness
as
the
former
prince
and
false
lalette
did
not
look
at
him
i
will
send
a
costumer
to
make
you
one
of
the
new
puffed
bodices
i
think
it
must
be
red
for
your
coloring
began
cleudi
and
then
stopped
his
eyes
seeming
to
jut
from
their
sockets
as
he
stared
at
the
wet
design
under
lalette
s
finger
her
own
gaze
focussed
and
suddenly
she
felt
tired
and
very
old
and
not
any
more
for
without
thinking
at
all
she
had
traced
the
her
mother
taught
her
long
ago
and
now
they
were
smoking
gently
on
the
witchery
croaked
the
count
but
recovered
faster
than
the
shock
itself
and
slid
in
one
motion
to
his
feet
with
an
ironical
bow
madame
my
congratulations
on
your
skill
in
deception
which
should
take
you
far
you
and
your
precious
mother
made
me
believe
you
yes
she
was
up
too
it
would
have
been
the
same
in
all
cases
i
don
t
want
your
filthy
costume
and
your
filthy
scudi
now
go
before
he
could
sign
himself
she
splashed
him
with
a
spray
of
the
dazzling
drops
from
her
fingertips
go
in
the
name
of
trustemus
and
vaton
before
i
bid
you
go
in
such
a
manner
you
can
never
rest
off
to
one
side
lalette
heard
her
mother
sob
cleudi
s
face
took
on
a
look
of
dogged
blankness
without
another
word
he
let
his
hands
drop
loose
to
his
side
trotted
to
the
door
and
through
it
cried
uncle
bontembi
we
ll
see
to
her
later
i
must
release
him
and
rushed
after
his
fingers
fumbling
in
his
robe
for
the
holy
oil
his
flesh
sagging
in
grey
bags
above
his
jowls
lalette
sat
down
slowly
her
mind
devoid
of
any
thought
save
a
kind
of
regretful
calm
now
she
had
done
it
as
her
mother
raised
a
face
where
tears
had
streaked
the
powder
oh
lalette
how
could
the
girl
felt
a
wild
flutter
of
being
trapped
again
but
both
had
forgotten
the
servant
mathurin
who
stepped
forward
to
grip
urgently
at
lalette
s
elbow
rodvard
bergelin
he
demanded
and
she
recoiled
from
the
temper
of
his
face
then
remembered
her
power
and
touched
his
hand
lightly
as
though
to
brush
it
away
saying
and
what
business
of
yours
if
it
was
he
is
the
only
one
can
save
you
the
blue
star
quickly
cleudi
will
never
forgive
you
he
ll
have
you
before
the
court
of
deacons
he
he
ran
round
the
table
to
dame
leonalda
madame
where
is
the
blue
star
it
belongs
to
your
daughter
and
she
must
leave
on
the
moment
you
will
not
know
her
if
she
has
the
torturers
to
deal
the
older
woman
only
collapsed
into
a
passion
of
alcoholic
sobbing
head
on
arms
across
the
table
i
suppose
i
must
trust
you
said
lalette
i
think
i
know
where
it
believe
me
you
must
he
is
as
cruel
as
a
crocodile
would
strew
your
grave
afterward
with
poems
written
by
himself
but
not
till
he
has
the
fullest
pains
from
you
is
it
in
that
lalette
had
pulled
aside
her
mother
s
bed
beneath
which
lay
the
old
leather
portmanteau
with
the
mathurin
tried
it
once
twice
it
would
not
give
before
the
girl
could
protest
he
whipped
a
knife
like
a
steel
tongue
from
beneath
his
jacket
and
expertly
slashed
around
the
fastening
the
portmanteau
fell
open
on
a
collection
of
such
small
gauds
and
bits
of
clothing
as
women
treasure
mathurin
shovelling
them
onto
the
floor
with
both
hands
until
at
the
back
he
came
on
an
old
old
wooden
box
maybe
a
handsquare
across
with
a
crack
in
the
wood
and
a
thin
slab
of
marble
that
might
once
have
borne
an
inscription
set
in
its
cover
that
must
be
it
said
lalette
though
i
have
seen
it
only
outside
the
case
i
can
not
be
certain

you

lives
in
the
street
of
the
weavers
the
third
house
on
the
left
as
you
turn
in
the
one
with
the
blue
door
do
not
wait
i
must
attend
my
escape
there
was
a
moon
to
throw
black
shadows
on
passing
cat
and
man
lalette
s
little
sharp
heels
clicked
so
loud
on
the
pave
that
she
almost
changed
to
tiptoe
the
street
of
the
weavers
was
known
to
her
at
its
gate
she
had
first
met
rodvard
amid
booths
gay
with
bunting
for
the
autumn
festival
he
slapped
her
with
a
bladder
then
and
challenged
her
to
dance
the
volalelle
among
the
reeling
violins
and
sweet
recorders
fair
lady
said
a
tentative
voice
not
even
looking
round
she
pulled
the
hood
closer
and
hurried
her
steps
until
those
behind
her
sounded
irresolute
and
then
died
away
one
two
three
moonlight
showed
a
door
that
would
be
a
worn
blue
by
day
clearly
a
pensionnario
lalette
caught
her
breath
at
the
loud
flat
rap
of
the
knocker
through
the
silent
street
held
it
for
a
long
minute
and
was
just
wondering
whether
she
dared
strike
again
when
there
was
a
sound
of
fuzzy
disturbance
within
and
a
wicket
window
beside
the
door
came
open
on
an
face
with
a
long
drooping
dirty
moustache
what
do
you
want
must
speak
with
rodvard
this
is
a
respectable
house
speak
with
him
in
the
it
matter
of
life
and
dear
god
as
the
wicket
began
to
close
she
reached
in
her
purse
and
recklessly
thrust
at
the
face
one
of
the
three
silver
spadas
that
were
all
the
money
she
had
in
the
world
what
will
mother
do
tomorrow
morning
the
face
expressed
a
sour
satisfaction
an
inarticulate
grumble
came
out
of
it
which
she
interpreted
as
a
command
to
wait
where
she
was
the
musicians
booth
had
been
where
the
shadow
of
a
turret
split
the
corner
in
particular
shapes
a
sound
of
footsteps
approached
the
door
from
within
and
it
opened
upon
rodvard
yawning
hair
awry
hose
wrinkled
at
the
knees
jacket
flung
around
unlaced
lalette
what
is
it
come
the
moustached
face
hung
itself
in
the
background
she
can
not
come
in
this
house
at
the
i
say
she
can
not
come
in
so
late
this
is
a
respectable
house
go
down
to
losleib
face
closed
the
door
rodvard
all
anxious
came
down
the
single
step
pulling
his
jacket
together
with
the
fine
brown
hair
curling
on
his
chest
in
the
form
of
a
star
what
is
it
can
you
help
me
i
do
not
want
to
be
a
burden
but
there
is
trouble
truly
not
meaning
to
i
set
a
witchery
on
count
cleudi
and
they
said
he
would
have
me
arrested
to
the
court
of
he
was
all
wideawake
and
grave
at
once
is
there
no
legalist
or
priest
you
she
stamped
would
i
come
here
to
your
respectable
house
i
did
not
only
this
is
to
be
thought
on
attention
i
have
heard
of
an
inn
by
the
north
gate
where
provosts
never
find
anyone
who
pays
i
will
go
with
i
have
hardly
any
even
in
that
uncandid
light
she
saw
his
face
frown
and
alter
almost
as
cleudi
s
had
another
resemblance
that
is
what
he
imagines
i
am
like
the
quick
thought
crossed
her
mind
bitterer
than
the
doorman
s
suspicion
wait
i
think
i
know
where
you
ll
be
safe
for
tonight
with
a
friend
of
mine
who
is
no
friend
of
provosts
or
court
lords
either
but
i
must
get
my
cap
and
she
was
quick
enough
dodging
his
kiss
to
make
it
seem
she
was
only
missing
the
intention
he
went
round
on
his
heel
and
up
the
stair
back
in
a
minute
with
the
feathered
cap
he
had
worn
that
afternoon
and
properly
belted
with
his
knife
this
friend
of
mine
is
a
remigorius
have
you
heard
of
him
a
great
man
to
roar
at
you
like
a
lion
but
of
good
and
generous
heart
for
the
poor
he
has
always
a
kind
word
and
often
physics
them
or
delivers
their
children
without
ever
asking
they
passed
into
the
night
city
how
did
it
happen
questioned
he
at
a
turning
in
the
beginning
an
do
not
ask
she
gestured
impatient
then
put
the
hand
that
did
not
hold
his
arm
up
to
her
face
and
now
i
am
a
witch
and
i
swore
i
never
would
it
is
my
fault
i
am
sorry
will
you
wed
with
me
the
words
were
out
he
felt
a
thrill
of
peril
run
up
his
spine
do
you
you
do
not
i
know
it
beside
how
would
we
find
a
priest
who
d
make
a
marriage
without
episcopal
for
a
witch
but
i
do
truly
desire
it
i
oh
spare
me
your
false
oaths
since
you
ask
forgiveness
i
ll
forgive
anything
but
she
gripped
his
arm
suddenly
so
hard
it
hurt
at
the
corner
of
the
next
street
was
a
watch
of
two
one
with
halberd
and
helmet
the
other
sword
and
lantern
but
the
sight
of
couples
would
be
less
than
novel
to
them
they
only
gave
a
glance
in
passing
rodvard
brought
her
round
another
corner
and
before
one
of
those
houses
built
with
jutting
overstoreys
in
the
zigraner
fashion
windows
were
beside
a
door
where
a
stiff
stuffed
lizard
hung
to
show
that
someone
within
practiced
the
art
medic
the
bell
tinkled
crackedly
rodvard
s
arm
came
around
the
girl
it
will
turn
to
a
happy
issue
he
said
no
harm
can
touch
us
now
we
each
she
did
not
try
to
draw
from
the
warm
sweet
pressure
and
it
endured
until
a
second
ring
brought
the
man
out
with
a
fine
beard
ridiculously
done
up
in
a
to
hold
its
shape
and
a
robe
like
a
priest
s
hastily
corded
round
him
this
is
the
demoiselle
asterhax
said
rodvard
can
you
help
her
she
has
put
a
witchery
on
one
of
the
court
lords
count
cleudi
and
is
searched
for
by
the
sleep
fell
from
the
older
man
s
eyes
a
witchery
the
tritulaccan
count
he
has
enough
favor
to
be
deadly
if
he
will
and
it
would
involve
me
in
the
overthrow
but
i
am
sworn
by
the
practice
of
the
healing
art
to
refuse
help
to
none
who
come
in
distress
enter
from
the
lalette
caught
a
darkling
glimpse
of
shelves
lined
with
jars
in
glass
or
stone
as
they
passed
through
rodvard
half
stumbled
against
a
stool
and
they
were
at
an
inner
door
where
remigorius
said
halt
struck
flint
and
steel
to
a
candle
and
stood
in
its
light
beside
the
untidy
bed
pulling
off
his
now
you
shall
tell
me
a
true
tale
of
how
this
came
about
he
said
for
a
physician
must
know
the
whole
nature
of
the
disease
he
is
to
cure
ha
ha
will
the
demoiselle
sit
he
swept
the
pile
of
his
own
garments
from
the
only
chair
to
the
bed
the
wine
in
her
limbs
and
the
long
double
walk
had
left
lalette
tired
and
safe
and
not
caring
very
much
now
she
sat
down
slowly
it
was
only
that
count
cleudi
came
with
some
baskets
of
supper
and
was
trying
to
persuade
me
to
go
to
the
with
him
and
i
was
toying
with
my
fingers
in
some
spilled
wine
on
the
table
you
know
how
one
she
made
a
little
gesture
of
appeal
i
accidentally
drew
witch
patterns
and
when
he
saw
what
they
were
would
have
had
me
against
my
will
so
i
witched
him
that
s
not
a
line
changed
in
remigorius
face
said
he
i
but
one
detail
what
made
you
flee
so
fast
by
midnight
to
my
friend
rodvard
what
do
you
know
about
this
count
cleudi
it
was
his
servant
a
man
named
mathurin
said
i
must
instantly
take
my
mother
s
blue
star
and
go
because
he
would
have
had
me
she
saw
rodvard
flick
up
his
eyebrows
as
he
glanced
at
remigorius
the
expression
round
his
mouth
might
have
been
triumph
which
was
incomprehensible
her
brow
knit
but
the
doctor
s
voice
was
smooth
as
ice
it
is
not
your
mother
s
blue
star
but
your
man
s
while
he
is
your
lover
and
i
think
this
must
be
the
case
or
you
would
not
have
witched
this
southern
count
you
have
ser
rodvard
s
bauble
safe
then
a
faint
perfume
of
it
to
herself
or
to
this
blue
star
that
he
was
offering
kindness
lalette
said
i
have
it
here
and
took
the
box
from
under
her
cloak
the
doctor
gravely
then
you
will
have
the
provosts
much
the
hotter
on
your
trail
since
the
lords
temporal
and
spiritual
are
not
desirous
to
have
these
things
in
hands
they
are
not
certain
of
i
think
you
must
fly
from
the
city
as
fast
as
you
can
perhaps
even
beyond
the
queen
s
writ
up
to
kjermanash
not
mayern
because
of
the
prince
and
his
prophecies
but
before
that
it
would
be
well
to
provide
this
blue
star
with
the
needed
witchery
and
let
ser
rodvard
bear
it
when
you
are
not
easily
found
be
sure
they
will
set
spies
out
for
you
and
with
this
tool
you
may
be
sure
of
people
you
lalette
frowned
but
looked
at
rodvard
is
this
your
word
also
how
could
it
be
other
i
think
we
may
need
the
very
she
lifted
one
palm
to
her
forehead
this
witching
is
i
think
something
that
leaves
one
without
force
or
will
and
i
have
performed
one
tonight
but
i
will
do
it
i
would
be
there
is
the
shop
do
you
require
materials
demoiselle
only
a
little
wine
would
be
remigorius
produced
a
bottle
with
wine
from
a
tall
cabinet
against
the
wall
lighted
a
and
swung
the
open
with
a
bow
when
it
had
closed
behind
her
rodvard
said
i
do
not
see
how
if
she
is
to
be
taken
instantly
from
the
city
i
can
use
this
blue
star
for
our
the
doctor
glanced
sidelong
and
whipped
a
finger
to
his
lips
tish
matter
for
the
high
center
but
who
said
you
would
go
with
her
they
were
quiet
a
small
sound
like
the
mewing
of
a
kitten
came
from
the
shop
then
it
stopped
and
lalette
came
back
in
the
hood
was
on
her
shoulders
and
her
face
was
white
to
the
the
wooden
case
stood
open
in
her
hand
and
in
it
lying
on
a
bed
of
white
silk
so
old
it
had
faded
to
yellow
the
blue
star
the
smaller
than
might
have
been
imagined
barely
a
across
but
seeming
to
have
depth
so
that
even
in
the
candlelight
all
the
sapphirean
fires
of
ocean
and
cold
hell
were
in
its
heart
rodvard
shivered
slightly
lalette
said
open
your
jacket
and
when
he
had
done
so
hung
the
jewel
round
his
neck
on
its
thin
gold
chain
now
i
will
tell
you
as
i
have
been
taught
she
said
that
while
you
wear
this
jewel
you
are
of
the
and
can
read
the
thoughts
of
those
in
whose
eyes
you
look
keenly
but
only
while
you
are
my
man
and
lover
for
this
power
is
yours
through
me
if
you
are
unfaithful
to
me
it
will
become
for
you
only
a
piece
of
glass
and
if
you
do
not
give
it
up
at
once
when
i
ask
it
back
there
will
lie
upon
you
and
it
a
deadly
witchery
so
that
you
can
never
rest
she
came
forward
to
take
his
face
in
both
hands
and
kiss
him
on
the
lips
the
stone
lay
like
a
piece
of
ice
against
his
bare
chest
rodvard
felt
no
different
unchanged
but
as
he
looked
deep
into
the
girl
s
eyes
before
him
he
knew
without
words
but
beyond
any
doubt
that
a
black
shadow
had
closed
round
her
mind
she
would
never
witch
him
she
had
decided
but
was
hating
all
this
and
remigorius
and
him
too
for
the
moment
he
turned
his
head
the
thought
flashed
away
and
the
doctor
said
with
a
twist
at
the
corner
of
his
lips
now
we
will
see
if
this
star
is
a
true
marvel
or
only
another
of
the
made
up
by
the
lords
of
court
to
keep
men
in
submission
look
in
my
eyes
ser
rodvard
and
tell
me
what
i
am
rodvard
looked
why
why
he
said
i
do
not
altogether
understand
but
it
is
as
though
you
were
saying
in
words
that
you
would
try
on
a
living
person
whether
an
infusion
of
squill
in
vinegar
is
useful
in
a
stoppage
of
the
it
was
not
the
complete
thought
there
was
a
formless
shadow
at
the
back
of
his
mind
something
about
a
treason
remigorius
shook
his
head
and
turned
from
the
gaze
with
pressed
lips
god
s
splendor
you
are
become
a
dangerous
man
ser
bergelin
he
said
or
a
cleverer
one
than
i
then
i
count
the
night
more
than
half
gone
and
you
will
need
rest
having
far
to
travel
in
the
morning
i
leave
you
two
my
bed
while
i
arrange
for
your
he
picked
up
his
clothes
and
bowed
himself
into
the
shop
to
dress
rodvard
and
lalette
were
left
alone
ii
she
remained
in
the
chair
with
her
head
drooping
and
slightly
to
one
side
so
he
could
see
only
the
angle
of
cheek
and
chin
the
bed
he
said
i
am
so
weary
said
she
that
it
s
not
needed
do
you
take
it
and
let
me
rest
here
i
ll
turn
my
back
if
you
wish
to
the
thought
went
tingling
through
his
mind
that
after
this
long
ago
needed
no
more
be
modest
with
each
other
it
almost
reached
his
lips
but
instead
no
you
shall
have
the
bed
you
need
it
and
held
his
hand
to
help
her
up
but
she
hardly
touched
it
on
her
feet
with
a
sweep
of
skirts
to
take
one
stumbling
step
to
the
towseled
bed
where
she
flung
herself
down
in
her
cloak
and
as
he
could
tell
from
her
breathing
was
asleep
almost
at
once
he
wakeful
as
an
with
excitement
and
having
slept
earlier
sat
in
a
chair
with
the
jewel
unfamiliar
around
his
contact
had
not
warmed
it
at
daydreaming
half
thinking
a
high
destiny
not
with
a
witch
and
through
witchery
all
he
thought
revolted
against
that
it
was
cheating
if
witchery
should
rule
there
was
an
end
of
free
choice
where
choice
meant
most
all
hopes
were
then
fled
there
s
no
new
day
if
this
rules
we
may
as
well
make
our
beds
under
the
old
queen
s
rule
and
that
of
florestan
the
laughing
chancellor
remigorius
the
doctor
would
say
this
was
not
what
he
thought
but
what
he
had
been
taught
they
had
quarrelled
on
this
issue
before
and
remigorius
would
say
how
rodvard
s
reasoning
led
straight
as
a
line
to
the
support
of
all
the
things
that
both
desired
to
throw
down
how
it
was
precisely
the
rejection
of
witchcraft
as
devilish
and
unclean
that
episcopals
and
queen
stood
for
if
there
were
a
good
god
as
the
church
said
he
could
not
allow
a
free
choice
that
might
be
turned
against
himself
and
so
deprive
him
of
godhead
mathurin
would
chime
in
at
this
point
to
say
that
no
man
under
tyranny
would
by
free
choice
choose
freedom
the
generality
preferring
rather
to
have
a
chance
of
rising
to
the
tyrant
s
seat
they
must
be
compelled
to
take
the
better
way
to
their
own
betterment
so
that
even
in
the
secular
affair
free
choice
was
a
then
he
rodvard
would
be
overborne
by
the
whirl
and
rush
of
their
arguments
a
high
destiny
let
us
sons
of
the
new
day
compel
them
then
ride
the
stormwind
to
greatness
by
setting
men
free
oh
it
would
be
noble
to
be
acclaimed
as
one
of
those
who
had
brought
about
the
change
but
no
no
that
honor
would
go
to
those
of
the
high
center
the
leaders
now
hidden
in
shadow
whose
forms
would
stand
forth
in
granite
with
the
dawning
of
the
new
the
name
of
rodvard
bergelin
was
never
heard
a
high
destiny
he
thought
of
battle
the
close
combat
where
steel
bows
flung
their
sharp
messengers
against
the
shields
and
horsemen
went
past
while
the
trumpets
shouted
the
rang
through
his
lift
the
star
of
old
dossola
brave
men
rise
and
tyrants
stare
no
the
star
would
never
rise
in
this
time
dossola
defeated
and
dead
to
honor
bound
down
by
treaties
which
queen
and
florestan
upheld
merely
to
keep
their
own
place
high
destiny
could
come
from
serving
such
a
cause
for
so
much
what
could
rodvard
bergelin
do
in
war
even
if
the
cause
were
better
there
had
been
dagus
of
grödensteg
to
be
sure
the
archer
the
great
hero
who
sprang
from
night
and
nowhere
when
zigraners
were
a
terror
to
the
thought
of
his
statue
in
the
long
square
one
arm
aloft
to
hold
the
deadly
bow
the
in
his
cap
but
that
was
in
the
glorious
times
when
one
could
clap
on
a
hat
and
run
forth
to
adventure
instead
of
a
day
s
toil
over
yellow
documents
at
the
office
of
pedigree
what
could
one
do
in
this
modern
war
where
noble
birth
and
twenty
years
of
service
were
needed
to
make
a
commander
he
d
lay
some
captain
s
bed
no
doubt
and
clean
his
tent
or
enter
for
a
man
learn
the
halberd
how
to
shoot
the
bow
and
form
dull
depressing
life
with
a
cold
lone
grave
at
the
end
of
it
stupid
as
a
spearman
said
the
proverb
and
all
he
had
known
were
stupid
enough
no
no
destiny
the
destiny
of
all
is
to
service
for
only
so
can
happiness
be
who
had
said
that
some
priest
member
of
what
mathurin
called
the
conspiracy
against
poverty
yet
if
it
were
not
true
one
must
save
one
s
services
for
oneself
and
be
false
as
hell
to
all
the
world
beside
let
conscience
die
and
dawn
began
to
poke
behind
the
gray
window
at
the
sound
of
the
doctor
s
entry
returning
daylight
refuge
lalette
sat
up
sleepily
and
sipped
a
little
wine
there
was
nothing
to
eat
but
the
end
of
a
loaf
most
of
which
rodvard
devoured
surprised
to
find
that
he
was
hungry
and
a
tingle
running
down
his
veins
as
he
thought
of
the
evening
under
the
cedars
remigorius
did
not
even
wait
for
the
end
of
the
meager
breakfast
before
breaking
out
with
hark
the
provosts
are
already
forth
this
must
be
hurried
and
you
two
must
leave
i
have
arranged
matters
to
the
least
peril
there
s
an
inn
on
king
crotinianus
square
at
the
north
end
called
the
sign
of
the
limping
cat
where
the
coaches
halt
to
pick
up
travellers
from
that
side
of
the
city
go
there
you
can
wait
on
the
bench
outside
and
had
better
to
avoid
talking
with
someone
who
might
be
a
spy
i
trust
you
demoiselle
to
keep
your
face
as
much
covered
as
possible
rodvard
you
shall
use
that
to
know
the
purpose
of
any
who
approach
there
will
be
a
coach
which
goes
to
bregatz
by
way
of
trandit
and
liazabon
the
driver
s
name
is
morsens
inquire
before
trandit
you
should
make
an
argument
for
the
benefit
of
others
in
the
coach
you
being
a
young
couple
just
wed
so
joyous
in
the
bridal
that
the
new
dame
s
trunk
has
been
forgot
at
trandit
then
ser
rodvard
will
descend
to
return
for
it
while
demoiselle
asterhax
rides
on
to
bregatz
in
the
care
of
morsens
the
coachman
and
reaches
those
of
the
center
there
are
you
players
enough
to
play
these
parts
it
will
thus
not
be
strange
when
morsens
protects
her
which
he
will
gladly
do
but
you
must
give
him
a
gold
scuderius
for
he
is
not
one
of
ours
and
his
danger
is
very
lalette
who
had
begun
to
take
down
her
hair
with
fingers
swift
and
sure
in
order
to
do
it
up
into
the
bridal
braids
stopped
with
pursed
mouth
but
i
do
not
have
a
scuderius
she
said
i
have
hardly
any
money
at
an
expression
of
furious
indignation
held
the
doctor
s
face
as
it
turned
toward
rodvard
you
but
the
young
man
flushing
reached
in
his
for
a
handful
of
coppers
and
one
single
silver
spada
perhaps
we
can
make
it
up
together
he
said
they
are
so
deep
in
arrears
of
pay
at
the
office
where
i
m
employed
or
if
we
can
find
a
zigraner
with
his
shop
open
early
i
might
pledge
my
wage
or
if
we
find
a
provost
with
scudi
instead
of
bilboes
for
those
he
pursues
cried
remigorius
madam
you
will
need
all
the
witchcraft
you
can
muster
for
you
are
surely
the
most
improvident
fool
that
ever
tried
an
evasion
with
what
did
not
belong
to
her
i
ve
no
money
he
tugged
at
his
beard
looking
at
her
from
eyes
but
before
lalette
could
more
than
begin
the
sound
of
a
hot
retort
changed
expression
shrugged
and
spread
his
hands
there
s
a
night
s
work
gone
glimmering
then
but
i
ll
not
send
you
back
to
cleudi
and
the
deacons
court
even
though
you
were
other
than
friend
rodvard
s
he
mused
and
rodvard
catching
his
eye
as
the
head
turned
saw
in
it
a
flash
of
deadly
acquisitiveness
for
the
blue
star
no
real
interest
in
lalette
s
fate
whatever
the
young
man
started
as
from
a
blow
remigorius
spoke
again
you
must
hide
in
the
city
then
till
somehow
transport
s
found
would
be
welcome
to
this
abode
but
too
many
come
here
for
physic
the
matter
would
be
bruited
about
nor
your
place
neither
rodvard
the
queen
s
provosts
will
not
be
long
in
finding
your
connection
with
this
demoiselle
no
your
mother
know
of
it
said
lalette
if
you
mean
of
rodvard
do
not
think
so
we
met
always
while
she
was
at
the
service
he
never
came
to
the
house
and
there
was
only
my
gossip
avilda
brekoff
who
was
ever
with
then
we
may
have
a
few
days
before
they
come
on
the
scent
were
you
seen
coming
here
last
night
only
by
a
watch
of
two
from
a
distance
and
by
the
doorman
where
i
live
said
rodvard
but
lalette
i
had
to
give
the
man
a
silver
spada
to
call
rodvard
and
there
was
some
slight
bargle
over
whether
i
might
enter
i
fear
i
was
not
only
seen
but
noted
i
you
may
well
here
s
the
few
days
lost
again
if
the
matter
s
pressed
they
will
surely
question
the
doorman
of
every
pensionnario
in
the
remigorius
swung
knit
brows
to
rodvard
you
had
best
go
to
your
working
place
today
for
the
absence
might
be
noted
but
i
will
let
you
return
to
your
pensionnario
for
only
the
once
and
then
to
bring
away
nothing
but
your
most
intimate
needs
stop
for
no
meal
where
there
s
least
till
we
can
be
sure
of
this
doorman
what
s
his
name
krept
or
something
like
it
i
do
not
know
for
sure
we
call
him
udo
the
crab
i
have
one
or
two
books
i
would
not
willingly
would
you
rather
lose
your
life
the
doctor
scrabbled
for
a
piece
of
paper
and
began
to
write
this
is
more
dreadful
than
you
know
of
demoiselle
you
can
be
secure
for
a
little
time
with
a
friend
of
ours
a
certain
mme
kaja
who
used
to
be
a
singer
in
the
opera
she
lives
on
the
top
floor
of
an
old
goat
s
nest
in
the
street
cossao
and
has
young
girls
visiting
her
all
the
time
for
instruction
in
music
so
there
ll
be
no
comment
at
your
his
pen
scratched
he
stood
up
threw
sand
on
the
paper
and
let
it
slide
to
the
floor
this
be
your
passport
your
the
word
was
accompanied
by
a
that
made
lalette
shiver
join
you
there
this
twilight
but
may
be
known
in
the
he
bustled
into
the
and
returned
with
a
pair
of
quills
up
your
nose
one
on
either
side
so
i
d
like
it
better
if
there
were
another
cloak
for
you
but
leave
the
hood
of
this
one
down
with
your
hair
changed
and
your
face
ii
it
would
be
the
morning
after
his
wedding
breakfast
on
new
wine
and
old
bread
with
fear
for
a
sauce
that
should
come
to
the
office
of
pedigree
her
bands
of
light
hair
fine
chin
line
and
cheekbones
and
the
pointed
coronet
badge
in
her
hat
that
showed
her
a
baron
s
daughter
all
morning
rodvard
had
been
dozing
and
drowsing
she
greeted
him
gaily
have
you
found
more
of
this
matter
with
which
the
stem
of
stojenrosek
is
to
confound
count
cleudi
or
has
the
weather
been
too
fine
for
work
indoors
no
there
was
a
twist
in
his
chest
he
could
barely
get
the
words
out
he
passed
the
chair
where
she
showed
a
turn
of
ankle
to
one
of
the
tall
dark
and
took
out
a
parchment
one
of
the
recorders
lighted
on
it
is
from
the
reign
of
king
crotinianus
the
second
the
great
king
and
bears
his
seal
of
the
boar
s
head
with
that
of
his
chancellor
it
is
a
series
of
decisions
on
inheritance
and
guardianship
for
the
province
of
zenss
at
the
eleventh
year
of
the
reign
there
is
one
he
handled
the
pages
over
carefully
the
son
of
stojenrosek
leave
to
wed
with
one
luedecia
and
pass
the
inheritance
to
their
daughters
though
she
s
but
a
bowman
s
daughter
herself
there
being
no
heiresses
female
to
take
the
estate
which
would
thus
have
fallen
to
the
she
had
stood
up
to
look
at
the
old
crabbed
chancery
hand
of
the
document
where
he
spread
it
on
the
table
and
her
shoulder
brushed
his
said
she
did
they
wed
then
alas
demoiselle
i
can
not
tell
shoulder
did
not
withdraw
so
many
of
the
records
of
that
time
were
destroyed
in
the
great
fire
at
zenss
a
quadrial
of
years
ago
but
i
will
do
so
i
can
not
read
it
she
said
what
does
this
say
her
fingers
touched
his
in
a
small
shock
where
they
were
outspread
to
hold
the
parchment
and
the
contact
rested
as
she
bent
to
look
in
the
spring
light
filtering
through
the
dusty
panes
the
inner
door
to
the
cabinet
adjoining
was
closed
down
the
corridor
outside
someone
was
whistling
as
he
walked
she
turned
her
head
to
face
him
slowly
he
felt
the
cold
as
ice
over
his
heart
and
to
shut
out
what
he
feared
was
coming
rodvard
croaked
chokingly
what
is
your
name
my
name
is
no
use
it
came
over
he
kiss
me
i
will
not
stay
him
i
will
marry
him
i
will
take
him
into
my
father
s
house
i
will
even
be
his
mistress
if
he
demands
it
this
disappearing
in
the
of
lalette
saying
if
you
are
ever
and
flash
on
flash
what
would
happen
if
he
lost
the
blue
star
for
which
he
had
sacrificed
so
much
sold
sold
she
caught
her
breath
a
little
he
disengaged
the
parchment
from
her
hand
i
will
have
it
copied
for
you
in
a
modern
hand
he
said
iii
under
remigorius
order
rodvard
did
not
go
home
to
the
pensionnario
at
as
usual
but
took
his
repast
for
a
pair
of
coppers
on
small
beer
and
cheese
at
a
tavern
near
his
labor
he
had
been
there
not
often
but
it
seemed
to
him
that
the
place
bubbled
with
talk
beyond
custom
and
he
wondered
if
the
cause
were
some
tale
of
count
cleudi
s
witching
and
lalette
s
escape
a
speculation
dispelled
on
his
return
for
there
came
to
him
young
asper
poltén
from
the
next
cabinet
with
did
you
know
that
girl
you
squired
to
the
harvest
festival
turned
out
to
be
a
witch
she
has
witched
count
cleudi
and
stolen
all
his
money
they
say
he
s
going
to
die
they
have
closed
the
city
gates
and
set
a
price
on
her
your
fortune
that
you
carried
matters
no
further
with
one
like
rodvard
shuffled
papers
some
reply
was
necessary
why
are
they
so
urgent
over
a
foreigner
people
have
been
witched
before
without
having
all
the
paving
stones
in
netznegon
city
torn
up
about
do
you
forever
live
in
dreams
he
s
the
new
director
of
the
lottery
only
yesterday
perhaps
that
s
the
reason
the
witch
rode
jealousy
more
than
the
scudi
she
s
not
to
be
blamed
if
as
i
hear
he
s
more
than
a
proper
man
in
the
parts
that
matter
most
to
women
they
say
cleudi
and
the
florestan
held
an
exhibition
for
her
majesty
and
the
tritulaccan
was
longer
speaking
of
which
ser
rodvard
you
are
not
far
from
fortune
yourself
i
saw
the
demoiselle
of
stojenrosek
here
again
today
she
ll
have
a
shapelier
body
than
cleudi
will
ever
press
and
bring
you
a
fortune
in
did
you
see
her
indeed
curse
you
and
what
business
is
it
of
yours
rodvard
wanted
to
cry
or
mine
s
the
high
destiny
of
the
but
aloud
he
could
only
say
there
s
nothing
in
that
she
s
only
searching
out
some
old
family
records
i
must
go
to
ser
habbermal
s
cabinet
he
has
a
project
forward
for
he
stood
up
with
a
trifling
stagger
leg
tingling
with
the
pain
of
the
position
in
which
he
had
cramped
it
asper
poltén
made
offended
eyes
ah
plah
you
are
too
nice
for
anything
but
priesthood
he
turned
away
flung
open
the
door
to
the
next
cabinet
and
could
be
heard
uttering
to
the
three
within
bergelin
again
this
time
pretending
he
does
not
know
what
women
carry
between
their
legs
or
what
it
s
used
with
a
whoop
of
merriment
from
the
rest
rodvard
himself
before
they
could
all
come
in
and
begin
their
usual
sport
of
baiting
walked
to
the
outer
door
through
it
and
without
so
much
as
pausing
at
the
garderobe
for
his
cap
straight
down
the
corridor
to
the
street
and
away
the
last
steps
running
if
there
were
stares
at
seeing
him
without
headgear
or
mark
of
condition
he
did
not
return
them
but
hurried
on
to
his
own
the
pensionnaria
was
at
the
foot
of
the
stairs
the
little
black
hairs
on
her
upper
lip
quivering
as
she
administered
some
rebuke
to
a
maid
who
held
a
trayful
of
dirty
dishes
but
her
eye
lighted
as
she
turned
to
perceive
a
new
victim
you
are
too
late
ser
bergelin
if
we
make
a
rule
good
for
one
it
must
stand
for
all
because
it
is
only
so
that
i
can
keep
up
a
place
like
this
as
cheap
as
it
is
and
i
simply
can
t
have
you
bringing
girls
here
late
at
night
i
have
told
udo
the
end
of
it
he
did
not
hear
as
he
broke
past
her
up
the
stairs
bounding
the
extra
set
of
hose
must
come
of
course
but
his
best
jacket
would
not
go
on
over
the
other
so
he
had
to
make
a
bundle
with
underclothing
and
wrap
it
in
the
cloak
that
it
was
too
fine
a
day
to
wear
the
must
stay
behind
even
though
it
might
bring
some
coppers
from
a
dealer
also
the
pair
of
tiny
for
carrying
at
the
waist
on
feast
days
of
whose
acquisition
he
had
been
so
proud
at
the
last
moment
he
added
the
volume
of
dostal
s
ballads
of
all
the
books
he
could
spare
that
one
least
there
was
a
moment
of
fear
when
a
glance
through
the
door
showed
callers
closeted
with
udo
the
crab
but
side
vision
registered
the
fact
that
they
were
only
a
pair
of
rough
fellows
in
leather
jackets
not
provosts
he
had
been
to
mme
kaja
s
only
once
before
and
then
at
night
for
a
meeting
of
the
sons
of
the
new
day
under
this
more
vivid
light
the
street
cossao
showed
as
a
dirty
courtyard
with
a
running
sore
of
gutter
down
the
center
garbages
piled
in
the
corners
yelling
children
underfoot
and
somewhere
among
the
upper
stories
a
hand
that
practiced
the
violon
monotonously
playing
the
but
always
going
sour
on
the
same
passage
rodvard
elected
the
wrong
house
first
the
doorman
did
not
know
of
kaja
but
the
next
one
at
the
back
angle
of
the
court
was
it
he
went
up
a
narrow
dark
winding
stair
smelling
of
yesterday
s
cabbage
and
knocked
at
the
topmost
door
mme
kaja
herself
answered
clad
in
an
old
pink
silk
and
dirty
gray
where
it
dragged
along
the
floor
with
her
hair
packed
untidily
atop
her
head
past
her
a
space
of
floor
was
visible
with
light
coming
through
a
pair
of
dormer
windows
a
keyed
musical
instrument
and
chairs
ser
rodvard
she
squealed
her
voice
going
into
a
high
musical
note
you
are
sooo
welcome
we
did
not
expect
you
this
early
the
dear
girl
is
a
door
against
the
slant
of
the
garret
opened
and
lalette
came
out
unaffectedly
glad
it
was
he
and
this
time
not
avoiding
as
he
ran
forward
to
kiss
her
on
the
lips
the
older
woman
i
leave
you
to
your
greetings
while
i
make
myself
she
passed
through
the
door
from
which
lalette
had
come
the
girl
sat
down
after
the
door
had
closed
behind
kaja
rodvard
she
said
very
still
and
looking
at
the
floor
i
have
given
you
my
blue
star
whether
to
marry
you
now
i
do
not
know
i
think
seems
to
me
that
you
are
not
altogether
willing
i
feel
you
are
holding
something
back
from
me
but
this
i
say
and
you
may
look
into
my
heart
and
find
it
she
raised
her
head
in
a
blaze
of
grey
eyes
i
want
to
be
a
good
partner
to
you
rodvard
and
will
honestly
do
all
in
my
power
never
to
fail
from
the
inner
room
came
the
sound
of
mme
kaja
running
scales
in
what
was
left
of
her
voice
and
what
could
he
say
thought
rodvard
who
had
won
this
loyalty
for
remigorius
reason
and
not
his
own
desire
let
conscience
die
but
not
with
a
tear
at
the
heartstrings
i
will
do
as
much
said
he
and
as
her
lip
quivered
at
his
tone
if
we
ever
pass
this
peril
with
our
she
lifted
a
hand
and
let
it
fall
beside
her
it
is
life
without
account
of
peril
that
i
have
offered
she
said
i
do
how
do
you
know
lalette
look
at
me
will
you
lie
with
me
this
night
in
peril
or
whatever
but
she
would
not
meet
the
questioning
eyes
now
and
he
thought
she
thought
they
both
knew
there
had
been
somehow
a
lack
of
communication
lalette
said
you
have
come
before
he
shuddered
slightly
they
picked
at
me
till
i
must
leave
you
will
hardly
believe
the
inner
door
sprang
open
and
mme
kaja
emerged
with
almost
a
dressed
to
the
eyes
in
withering
finery
for
a
little
while
i
must
go
forth
she
said
but
you
will
hardly
miss
me
he
he
i
ll
bring
sup
from
the
is
there
a
delicacy
you
desire
or
any
other
way
i
can
lighten
captivity
for
my
two
caged
birds
she
beamed
on
them
fondly
rodvard
thought
of
the
cap
left
at
the
office
and
prayed
her
for
a
new
one
with
the
badge
of
his
condition
which
took
more
of
his
slender
store
of
coppers
the
door
closed
and
now
they
two
had
not
much
to
say
to
each
other
having
agreed
that
all
that
mattered
should
be
left
unsaid
the
end
of
it
was
that
lalette
in
all
her
clothes
lay
down
on
the
bed
in
the
corner
to
make
up
for
some
of
the
sleep
lost
last
night
while
he
undid
his
parcel
and
set
out
to
lose
himself
in
iren
dostal
s
harmonies
and
that
did
not
do
very
well
either
the
poems
he
had
always
loved
seemed
suddenly
pointless
he
fell
into
a
kind
of
doze
or
waking
dream
in
which
the
thought
came
to
his
mind
that
if
he
were
really
ready
to
let
conscience
die
in
exchange
for
high
destiny
he
had
only
to
give
this
witch
back
her
blue
star
call
for
the
provosts
and
claiming
the
price
set
on
her
seek
out
maritzl
of
stojenrosek
a
destiny
not
high
by
the
standards
of
the
sons
of
the
new
day
no
doubt
but
love
and
position
aye
remigorius
would
approve
would
call
it
the
act
of
a
great
spirit
to
seek
an
inner
contentment
no
matter
what
others
thought
of
how
it
was
achieved
no
matter
if
others
were
hurt
during
the
achievement
but
remigorius
thought
the
struggle
more
important
than
its
it
might
be
that
the
reason
he
rodvard
could
see
no
high
destiny
was
that
he
did
not
possess
such
a
spirit
immune
to
scruple
willing
to
serve
any
cause
now
he
fell
on
to
wondering
what
was
the
tangle
of
ideas
and
thoughts
that
made
up
himself
rodvard
bergelin
where
they
came
from
and
how
they
were
put
they
be
altered
so
drifted
deeper
into
his
daydream
till
it
began
to
grow
dusk
and
mme
kaja
came
back
with
a
covered
dish
of
fish
and
red
beans
night
generosity
treason
she
was
less
cooing
than
before
having
learned
of
the
closing
of
the
city
gates
and
the
price
on
lalette
for
the
first
time
she
knows
what
it
is
to
be
a
conspirator
rodvard
thought
there
was
a
debate
over
where
to
sleep
for
the
singer
had
only
the
one
bed
and
tried
to
insist
that
the
pair
use
it
or
at
least
share
it
with
her
in
the
end
rodvard
composed
himself
across
a
pile
of
old
garments
on
the
floor
they
smelled
he
felt
and
went
to
sleep
wondering
rather
desperately
what
to
do
about
money
that
problem
became
no
easier
with
the
morning
when
mme
kaja
said
her
own
funds
were
very
low
and
she
could
not
receive
her
pupils
while
the
two
were
there
as
she
was
going
out
rodvard
gave
her
his
last
silver
spada
whose
breakup
would
keep
them
nourished
for
a
couple
of
days
lalette
added
that
she
was
much
concerned
over
her
mother
could
the
singer
obtain
news
hardly
had
the
receding
footsteps
left
the
first
flight
when
rodvard
burning
inwardly
with
anxiety
suspense
and
the
thought
of
another
day
which
combined
to
translate
themselves
into
desire
swung
the
girl
off
her
feet
in
his
arms
and
bore
her
toward
the
bed
without
a
word
she
struggled
a
little
and
the
blue
star
told
him
she
was
not
very
willing
but
the
contact
of
their
bodies
soon
caught
her
she
only
asked
to
be
careful
of
her
dress
as
she
pulled
it
mme
kaja
s
voice
said
rodvard
rolled
over
blood
running
hot
through
his
cheeks
i
am
sorry
the
older
woman
said
i
was
going
to
the
service
and
found
i
had
forgot
my
book
of
days
but
you
must
not
mind
really
you
must
not
when
i
was
in
the
opera
his
majesty
used
to
make
three
of
us
attend
him
together
and
when
the
heart
speaks
rattling
like
a
broken
in
terms
that
rodvard
scarcely
heard
as
she
crossed
the
room
to
take
the
book
of
days
and
left
again
without
looking
at
them
directly
lalette
feeling
as
though
she
had
bathed
in
a
sewer
and
never
wanted
to
touch
anything
clean
again
took
her
dress
to
put
it
on
when
rodvard
touched
her
shoulder
she
shook
his
hand
away
and
said
simply
it
was
my
fault
he
said
and
i
no
i
am
the
one
most
to
blame
it
does
not
matter
now
for
any
her
mouth
moved
and
she
looked
down
tieing
laces
dear
god
what
your
fine
friends
will
think
of
me
i
should
have
accepted
count
cleudi
s
offer
at
least
i
would
have
been
well
paid
for
the
name
i
ll
he
felt
himself
flush
again
well
if
they
call
you
any
name
you
do
not
wish
to
have
it
will
be
your
own
fault
he
said
i
have
offered
you
ah
yes
indeed
with
me
furnishing
the
priest
s
spada
for
the
i
will
hold
to
the
offer
demoiselle
you
are
not
she
turned
and
sat
down
feeling
suddenly
weary
bitten
with
the
edge
of
concern
about
her
mother
so
that
it
was
not
worth
while
to
quarrel
he
made
one
or
two
beginnings
of
speech
but
could
settle
on
nothing
worth
saying
moved
about
the
room
clanking
the
coppers
in
his
pocket
and
looked
out
the
window
picked
at
one
or
two
keys
of
the
music
in
a
manner
that
showed
he
had
no
training
with
it
found
a
book
of
mme
kaja
s
and
standing
skimmed
a
few
pages
then
set
it
down
resumed
his
pacing
abandoned
it
walked
to
where
he
had
placed
his
few
belongings
on
a
chair
took
his
own
book
and
settled
himself
purposefully
to
read
in
a
position
where
his
face
was
mostly
in
shadow
from
her
the
angry
shame
had
run
off
lalette
now
she
could
only
see
that
he
was
truly
unhappy
after
a
little
while
she
ran
across
the
room
put
her
arms
around
his
shoulder
and
kissed
the
side
of
his
face
rodvard
she
said
i
really
meant
it
all
if
you
want
me
you
may
have
me
any
time
you
he
swung
her
down
to
his
lap
but
now
afraid
of
interruption
would
go
no
farther
than
kissing
her
and
holding
her
close
so
for
a
long
time
they
remained
thus
lip
to
lip
speaking
a
little
to
exchange
memories
of
things
pleasant
in
their
few
meetings
and
not
noticing
they
had
missed
a
meal
until
they
heard
mme
kaja
s
step
outside
the
door
which
this
time
she
made
firm
enough
to
give
them
warning
the
singer
began
to
talk
at
once
about
the
service
and
how
as
the
chanters
intoned
the
celestial
melody
and
the
violet
vestments
fluttered
among
the
flowers
that
fell
from
the
galleries
to
crush
fragrantly
beneath
the
worshipers
knees
she
could
feel
every
power
of
evil
roll
from
her
though
the
second
baritone
was
flat
in
the
oh
if
only
the
court
would
have
religion
in
its
heart
as
the
poor
people
do
who
sat
with
tears
in
their
she
smiled
suddenly
on
lalette
i
spoke
to
my
own
priest
too
for
you
i
know
you
must
have
a
confession
to
make
by
she
held
up
outspread
fingers
before
her
face
and
tittered
through
them
i
made
up
a
story
for
you
about
a
jealous
husband
and
he
will
hear
you
after
dark
when
all
s
safe
and
you
won
t
have
to
pay
but
a
copper
or
lalette
looked
up
but
there
s
no
confession
to
make
did
you
find
out
about
my
mother
rodvard
saw
mme
kaja
s
eyes
open
wide
and
felt
the
cold
stone
she
was
not
believing
lalette
at
all
and
for
some
reason
was
desperately
frightened
that
the
girl
should
lie
oh
you
poooor
child
she
said
it
was
so
unthinking
of
me
to
forget
to
tell
you
i
did
not
find
out
much
but
i
know
the
provosts
have
not
taken
her
and
count
cleudi
is
not
as
ill
as
pretended
that
is
only
a
she
set
down
packages
of
food
a
dish
of
lentils
with
bread
and
wine
began
to
make
ready
the
table
keeping
her
eyes
averted
so
rodvard
could
not
read
her
thinking
it
came
to
him
that
he
would
not
be
the
first
she
had
met
as
she
talked
rapidly
about
the
service
once
more
the
priest
had
said
that
when
anyone
admitted
evil
to
his
heart
peril
lay
upon
all
persons
approaching
the
lost
one
for
these
powers
of
evil
increase
like
mice
in
a
granary
running
from
one
soul
to
another
and
as
farmers
will
often
burn
an
old
to
keep
the
vermin
from
spreading
so
it
is
lawful
and
even
necessary
to
destroy
the
body
of
one
infected
by
the
powers
of
evil
he
was
talking
about
this
poor
child
here
it
was
easy
to
rodvard
to
whom
this
was
interesting
if
somewhat
questionable
discourse
would
have
inquired
more
as
she
paused
for
breath
but
lalette
who
found
it
more
than
tiresome
broke
in
to
ask
what
of
the
city
what
of
the
hunt
for
her
oh
they
have
opened
the
gates
again
though
i
did
not
go
to
see
and
put
guards
everywhere
but
it
will
be
all
right
have
i
ever
recounted
to
you
friend
rodvard
that
i
was
in
arrest
once
myself
it
was
because
of
that
oronari
who
was
so
jealous
because
i
could
carry
the
high
note
in
the
mayern
lovers
while
she
could
not
and
had
me
accused
of
stealing
some
of
the
jewels
that
were
loaned
for
the
spring
festival
performance
i
felt
very
badly
about
it
because
she
was
a
friend
of
mine
but
it
s
just
as
the
priest
said
the
power
of
evil
had
gained
control
over
her
and
there
was
nothing
i
could
do
but
complain
to
the
baron
coespel
who
was
my
protector
then
and
he
had
her
banished
the
she
stuffed
food
into
her
mouth
masticating
noisily
as
she
babbled
rodvard
caught
a
flash
of
lalette
s
eye
and
knew
she
was
thinking
how
thin
the
veneer
of
half
a
lifetime
around
the
court
was
over
someone
with
a
peasant
s
background
to
change
things
he
asked
madame
is
there
any
word
of
the
doctor
he
did
not
send
the
fruiterer
from
his
street
she
sighed
and
turned
to
lalette
then
it
is
likely
that
he
has
no
money
as
yet
he
is
so
good
and
kind
and
works
for
so
little
that
it
is
often
so
dear
child
have
you
no
funds
at
all
said
lalette
only
two
spadas
but
i
took
all
the
money
in
the
house
when
i
left
and
my
dear
child
of
course
we
all
love
our
parents
and
do
all
we
can
for
them
but
after
all
they
are
only
our
relatives
by
accident
and
not
the
choice
of
the
she
smote
her
breast
in
the
gesture
rodvard
remembered
when
the
heart
speaks
god
dwells
in
us
to
drive
out
the
powers
of
evil
then
we
are
grateful
to
those
who
speak
to
us
through
the
heart
and
if
we
have
anything
we
give
it
to
them
i
denied
the
heart
your
pardon
said
lalette
and
stood
up
to
leave
the
table
her
face
was
a
little
white
mme
kaja
finished
the
last
of
the
wine
and
wiped
her
mouth
i
know
it
is
hard
for
you
being
of
the
dear
child
she
said
but
uncle
tutul
who
is
the
priest
we
are
going
to
see
tonight
says
that
even
a
witch
may
save
herself
if
she
gives
up
everything
to
those
she
loves
and
oh
my
dear
i
really
do
not
mind
missing
my
pupils
lalette
s
mouth
strained
she
stood
up
and
plucked
from
her
waist
the
tiny
purse
here
she
cried
are
the
spadas
and
flung
them
ringing
silvernly
against
the
plates
take
them
i
am
going
to
the
provosts
myself
to
be
seduced
i
will
it
was
my
fault
but
i
will
owe
no
obligation
for
she
turned
to
the
door
so
fast
that
rodvard
barely
barred
the
way
before
her
no
said
he
as
she
tried
to
push
him
from
the
way
you
shall
not
go
like
their
hands
caught
and
she
struggled
for
a
moment
or
if
you
ll
say
you
do
not
love
and
never
will
go
and
i
will
join
you
before
the
deacons
court
but
it
was
another
tale
that
you
told
said
mme
kaja
oh
dear
child
you

at

mercy
of

friend
rodvard
she
swung
to
face
him
for
an
unguarded
moment
and
he
was
staggered
till
he
must
grip
the
at
the
blast
of
hate
for
lalette
behind
her
eyes
there
was
a
strange
in
it
too
he
could
not
make
out
the
detail
kaja
s
glance
went
restlessly
on
across
the
room
she
stood
up
in
her
turn
saving
i
do
not
know
the
hour
my
watch
is
being
repaired
but
i
am
sure
by
the
dimness
outside
it
must
be
late
and
uncle
tutul
is
waiting
demoiselle
i
shall
call
you
lalette
it
is
so
much
more
you
come
rodvard
thought
if
i
let
her
go
everything
will
arrange
itself
to
my
utmost
advantage
maritzl
he
said
do
not
go
out
this
evening
there
s
mme
kaja
tittered
once
more
ah
friend
rodvard
she
said
if
you
d
have
women
kind
to
you
you
must
remember
their
names
will
you
come
demoiselle
lalette
even
if
there
s
no
confession
it
will
be
a
joy
to
hear
uncle
tutul
s
rodvard
lalette
i
beg
you
by
all
you
have
said
this
day
and
all
we
hope
for
in
the
future
do
not
go
out
now
i
have
a
he
reached
one
hand
and
took
hers
as
she
looked
at
him
wondering
why
he
was
so
vehement
in
such
a
small
matter
a
child
s
look
with
trust
in
it
well
then
and
she
sat
down
again
a
glassy
smile
appeared
on
mme
kaja
s
face
and
she
shook
one
finger
at
lalette
as
she
hurried
to
the
door
you
naughty
rodvard
she
will
certainly
have
a
confession
to
make
before
i
return
and
her
steps
were
audible
going
down
lalette
s
hands
lay
listless
in
her
lap
for
a
minute
there
was
silence
in
which
she
rose
walking
slowly
to
the
window
to
gaze
out
and
down
not
turning
around
what
is
your
reason
and
who
is
maritzl
he
had
begun
to
make
up
his
bundle
with
quick
fingers
the
volume
of
iren
dostal
inside
we
must
leave
here
forthwith
the
blue
will
do
you
a
terrible
harm
if
she
you
have
told
me
nothing
i
did
not
know
without
that
bit
of
witchery
a
pattern
would
be
useless
against
her
though
she
is
too
close
to
the
church
what
will
you
have
he
pulled
the
edge
of
the
cloak
tight
i
am
sorry
i
said
what
lately
i
did
about
being
seduced
will
you
forgive
i
do
not
wish
to
be
a
shrew
as
my
mother
said
and
i
will
say
that
i
do
not
we
he
dropped
the
knot
and
ran
over
to
her
but
she
shifted
in
his
grasp
pointing
rodvard
down
the
line
of
her
finger
he
saw
hurrying
figures
pass
the
lantern
at
the
gate
of
the
street
cossao
impossible
to
miss
mme
kaja
or
the
priest
or
the
provost
with
bare
alerted
sword
said
rodvard
i
did
not
think
her
so
quick
in
her
grimness
is
there
another
stair
not
that
i
know
i
am
sure
not
no
escape
that
can
not
be
true
life
is
to
those
who
struggle
for
it
says
he
threw
the
latch
and
pushed
the
window
outward
not
a
foot
down
lay
a
broad
which
being
proved
solid
by
test
he
went
three
rapid
steps
across
the
room
to
sling
his
bundle
over
one
shoulder
stepped
out
cautiously
caught
a
grip
at
the
edge
of
the
dormer
with
his
right
hand
not
daring
to
look
down
into
the
dizzy
dark
and
stretched
the
other
to
lalette
oh
come
he
could
feel
her
shiver
dreadfully
as
she
took
the
step
she
almost
tripped
over
her
dress
on
the
sill
but
once
out
it
was
she
who
stretched
to
the
limit
of
his
restraining
hand
to
swing
the
window
closed
by
good
fortune
it
was
a
suave
spring
night
rodvard
could
see
stars
past
the
rim
of
the
house
as
they
edged
rightward
free
hands
pressed
against
the
slates
of
the
mansard
until
contact
was
made
with
the
second
dormer
the
one
in
the
dressing
room
he
gripped
at
that
edge
sliding
foot
against
foot
the
bundle
almost
pulling
him
off
balance
where
he
came
against
the
projection
hurry
whispered
lalette
i
can
hear
ahead
and
beyond
the
roof
turned
one
might
work
round
that
backslope
but
it
would
only
lead
to
the
opposite
side
of
mme
kaja
s
garret
rodvard
halted
his
sliding
progress
and
looked
over
his
shoulder
to
see
the
loom
of
the
house
at
the
back
of
the
court
fortunately
of
the
same
height
a
glance
down
showed
another
gutter
with
something
more
than
a
of
black
space
in
separation
he
turned
again
face
brushing
slates
to
make
out
that
lalette
had
seen
it
too
shall
we
try
it
he
whispered
and
then
incontinently
i
love
you
which
was
for
that
enchanted
moment
true
for
answer
she
disengaged
her
hand
from
his
and
began
to
tuck
up
her
skirt
leaning
with
cheek
against
the
roofslope
he
swung
and
tossed
the
bundle
to
the
other
gutter
set
foot
on
the
edge
where
they
were
teetered
and
with
perspiring
palms
pushed
himself
into
the
long
step
almost
going
down
when
the
lip
of
the
opposite
gutter
proved
higher
but
it
was
wider
as
well
it
held
he
was
able
to
reach
a
hand
out
and
pull
her
across
there
were
no
windows
on
this
side
of
the
other
house
they
found
it
easy
to
slide
along
leftward
to
the
corner
and
by
the
especial
grace
of
heaven
there
was
a
drain
at
the
angle
in
which
rodvard
s
foot
caught
to
keep
them
from
tumbling
where
the
gutter
ended
suddenly
with
the
back
of
the
building
going
down
sheer
they
both
stood
breathless
as
a
window
in
the
building
they
had
just
left
cracked
open
a
voice
said
no
not
along
the
gutter
there
perhaps
they
mme
kaja
s
titter
was
raised
we
must
get
more
men
and
lalette
pressed
rodvard
s
hand
the
window
closed
and
they
stood
mute
on
the
finger
laced
in
finger
for
it
seemed
a
long
time
from
below
in
the
court
voices
floated
up
clear
as
though
they
were
only
a
few
feet
away
except
that
one
could
not
make
out
words
only
that
kaja
s
tone
was
among
the
rest
lalette
drew
him
to
her
and
whispered
we
must
go
back
through
before
she
returns
and
began
to
lead
to
where
they
had
crossed
the
gap
she
was
clearly
right
they
had
no
future
there
the
roof
where
they
were
had
no
break
was
only
the
side
of
the
building
which
went
to
its
peak
at
the
front
as
well
as
the
back
the
return
with
its
repetition
of
peril
already
overcome
was
worse
than
the
passage
rodvard
had
to
stand
on
the
very
edge
of
the
gutter
to
swing
back
lalette
followed
lightly
by
the
time
he
had
reached
the
window
of
the
worked
it
open
with
one
hand
and
had
a
leg
across
the
sill
he
dared
look
saw
what
might
have
made
them
earlier
hesitate
about
making
a
return
namely
a
blue
provost
standing
watchfully
under
the
lamp
at
the
street
entrance
while
two
or
three
figures
more
were
moving
about
but
like
most
searchers
they
never
looked
aloft
where
whispered
lalette
as
they
stood
in
the
room
and
he
we
dare
not
leave
the
building
now
even
if
they
were
not
below
the
doorman
will
be
awake
have
you
seen
anyone
else
here
i
have
been
a
then
we
must
try
at
random
whether
it
is
true
as
the
priests
say
that
not
all
men
are
crossing
the
outer
room
hand
in
hand
in
the
dark
rodvard
stumbled
against
a
chair
swore
softly
and
they
both
laughed
under
breath
a
board
creaked
so
did
the
hinges
of
the
outer
door
and
they
were
going
down
each
in
turn
tripping
a
little
at
the
short
end
of
the
steps
where
the
stairway
turned
by
unspoken
mutual
agreement
they
tiptoed
past
the
door
of
the
outer
apartment
of
the
fifth
and
to
that
at
the
rear
of
the
house
rodvard
gathered
his
breath
and
knocked
night
and
day
the
place
of
masks
no
step
sounded
but
as
they
stood
close
to
catch
any
stir
a
clear
childish
treble
came
muffled
through
the
wood
what
is
it
rodvard
squeezed
lalette
s
hand
i
can
not
tell
you
from
here
she
said
with
her
mouth
close
to
the
door
but
we
need
help
will
you
let
us
in
pause
in
which
a
chain
rattled
in
the
name
and
protection
of
the
god
of
love
enter
and
the
door
melted
before
them
into
a
darkness
different
because
it
held
shapes
stand
there
till
i
make
a
light
said
the
young
voice
you
must
be
careful
not
to
break
there
was
a
small
sound
of
fumbling
flint
and
steel
clicked
and
the
candle
came
slowly
into
light
on
a
scene
that
made
rodvard
and
lalette
both
almost
cry
out
for
the
small
room
seemed
crowded
with
people
princes
and
queens
with
coronets
richly
and
gaily
dressed
beggars
in
rags
of
silk
yellow
warriors
with
helmets
zigraners
with
and
sliding
eyes
and
all
other
fantasies
of
human
shape
so
in
the
uncertain
gleam
that
it
was
an
before
they
could
be
recognized
as
festival
masquerades
in
the
midst
of
them
a
boy
of
it
might
be
anywhere
from
twelve
to
sixteen
stood
bowing
gravely
in
his
candle
held
at
arm
s
length
i
am
glad
to
see
you
he
said
my
name
is
laduis
it
was
a
good
name
for
them
from
the
northwestern
provinces
where
queen
and
florestan
were
least
popular
said
rodvard
we
are
pursued
by
the
city
provosts
because
a
court
lord
wishes
harm
to
this
lady
will
you
help
her
get
away
the
boy
looked
at
lalette
cocking
his
head
on
one
side
as
though
listening
to
a
distant
voice
yes
he
said
my
heart
says
it
is
right
and
we
must
always
listen
to
the
heart
besides
we
don
t
like
the
thank
you
said
lalette
where
are
your
parents
father
is
in
another
world
and
mother
s
at
the
marquis
of
palm
s
palace
to
make
the
costumes
for
the
spring
festival
she
s
going
to
stay
all
night
and
she
told
me
i
must
go
to
bed
but
this
is
more
he
looked
at
lalette
again
and
his
eyes
widened
suddenly
oh
are
you
the
witch
witch
something
for
in
spite
of
her
situation
lalette
smiled
aren
t
you
afraid
it
would
hurt
you
oh
no
we
are
amorosians
and
so
witches
can
t
hurt
anything
but
our
outsides
i
m
not
supposed
to
tell
anybody
that
only
the
provosts
are
after
you
too
so
it
s
all
from
outside
came
the
sound
of
feet
tramp
tramp
on
the
stair
and
distant
voices
they
are
going
to
search
said
rodvard
laduis
the
lady
will
come
back
and
witch
something
for
you
another
day
but
just
now
we
must
get
her
away
from
the
provosts
is
there
any
way
out
of
this
house
except
by
the
main
stair
the
boy
was
all
seriousness
not
from
this
floor
ser
i
used
to
go
down
the
from
ser
tetteran
s
quarter
but
that
was
when
i
was
thirteen
and
it
isn
t
then
we
must
hide
rodvard
s
eye
darted
round
the
small
room
took
in
the
door
to
that
still
smaller
where
beds
must
be
the
masks
can
you
help
us
into
some
of
these
laduis
domijaiek
clapped
his
hands
and
they
set
to
lalette
a
kjermanash
princess
whose
billowing
imitation
furs
would
hide
the
trimness
of
her
figure
a
hunchback
zigraner
moneylender
for
rodvard
with
a
bag
of
scudi
her
dress
had
to
come
off
but
the
boy
took
it
to
hang
with
his
mother
s
and
came
back
to
help
rodvard
adjust
the
as
furniture
was
moved
overhead
the
thumping
came
to
an
end
there
was
the
sound
of
feet
on
the
stairs
once
more
rodvard
and
lalette
squeezed
past
the
ghostly
figures
at
the
front
of
the
assembled
masks
and
the
boy
blew
out
the
candle
bang
the
queen
s
warrant
said
a
voice
outside
open
rodvard
could
hear
the
boy
s
feet
go
pad
pad
on
the
floor
from
the
bedroom
acting
his
part
in
all
detail
what
is
it
queen
s
warrant
we
re
looking
for
an
chain
rattled
through
the
of
the
mask
rodvard
could
see
the
priest
in
the
light
of
the
provost
s
lantern
and
held
his
breath
my
mother
is
not
we
don
t
need
her
stand
rodvard
stood
rigid
cursing
himself
for
a
fool
to
have
put
on
this
zigraner
guise
with
its
bag
of
false
coins
that
might
jingle
by
the
service
the
whole
assembly
s
the
priest
held
high
his
amulet
this
was
the
moment
of
test
but
it
passed
so
lightly
there
might
have
been
no
test
at
all
the
provost
raised
his
lantern
anybody
call
on
you
tonight
sprout
i
was
asleep
ser
the
man
grunted
light
flickered
as
he
went
into
the
bedroom
there
was
a
thud
as
though
he
might
be
kicking
something
and
he
came
back
into
the
sweep
of
sight
a
naked
shortsword
showing
in
his
hand
not
there
he
said
ah
bah
she
s
a
witch
and
has
spirited
herself
to
the
green
islands
but
i
ll
have
my
he
swung
his
sword
at
the
neck
of
a
mayern
fighting
man
and
rodvard
heard
the
head
crack
to
the
floor
as
the
boy
cried
oh
the
provost
three
scudi
reward
for
a
foeman
down
tell
your
mother
i
saved
you
from
a
villain
hark
now
open
your
door
this
night
to
none
more
an
order
in
her
majesty
s
the
door
banged
to
leave
it
dark
for
those
within
and
feet
retreated
beyond
rodvard
stirred
cramped
muscles
will
they
come
back
lalette
s
voice
whispered
the
candle
lifted
slowly
into
light
laduis
domijaiek
was
on
one
knee
beside
the
fallen
head
whose
nose
was
broken
off
the
eyes
that
looked
up
held
tears
that
man
killed
baron
mondaifer
he
said
fiercely
and
i
would
like
to
kill
him
lalette
slipped
off
her
and
ran
a
hand
across
her
hair
looking
very
princess
with
her
dark
head
against
the
white
kjermanash
fur
a
true
sorrow
and
it
is
our
fault
she
said
do
you
have
names
for
them
all
oh
yes
you
are
the
princess
sunimaa
and
she
s
always
getting
into
trouble
because
it
s
cold
where
she
comes
from
and
her
heart
is
all
ice
and
the
others
don
t
like
her
except
for
bonsteg
the
beggar
who
is
really
a
prince
in
disguise
only
she
doesn
t
know
it
yet
but
baron
mondaifer
was
one
of
my
favorites
he
s
from
mayern
you
see
and
he
s
always
lived
in
the
forest
even
if
he
is
in
favor
of
prince
pavinius
and
thinks
he
s
still
a
good
said
rodvard
undoing
laces
to
get
out
of
his
zigraner
dress
your
mother
will
get
someone
to
fix
him
and
bring
him
back
to
no
his
spirit
s
gone
away
to
another
body
like
father
s
and
now
there
isn
t
anything
left
but
dust
if
mother
has
a
new
head
made
i
shall
have
to
give
it
a
different
the
boy
looked
at
rodvard
solemnly
and
though
the
blue
star
was
cold
as
cold
upon
his
breast
he
could
not
somehow
draw
quite
clear
the
thought
behind
those
young
candid
about
a
place
shrouded
in
clouds
an
old
house
somewhere
with
a
diffused
golden
light
weariness
slit
his
jaws
into
a
yawn
there
is
a
place
where
we
can
sleep
ii
they
had
to
take
his
mother
s
bed
not
meant
for
more
than
one
so
that
for
the
first
time
they
lay
close
wrapped
in
each
other
s
arms
with
a
night
before
them
and
this
with
the
sharp
memory
of
the
peril
shared
on
the
rooftops
hand
in
hand
was
a
little
more
than
either
could
quite
bear
unmoved
even
though
the
boy
was
in
a
corner
of
the
room
they
began
kissing
and
holding
each
other
very
tight
presently
deep
breaths
said
laduis
was
asleep
she
did
not
resist
nor
desire
to
afterward
rodvard
lay
for
a
long
time
wakeful
thinking
that
this
had
been
the
sobbing
true
union
not
an
arranged
accident
like
that
under
the
tree
they
had
pledged
each
other
and
were
somehow
one
forever
now
he
was
committed
and
there
was
a
deep
harsh
sweetness
in
the
thought
of
devotion
and
change
live
and
love
forgetting
all
ambition
high
destiny
and
even
the
sons
of
the
new
day
that
had
brought
him
to
this
of
course
lark
and
laduis
rose
before
them
in
the
morn
the
first
the
pair
heard
was
a
double
rap
at
the
outer
door
and
the
boy
s
voice
saying
mother
we
have
rodvard
rolled
out
to
make
the
best
bow
he
could
with
half
his
laces
still
undone
and
saw
a
small
woman
of
careworn
aspect
and
maybe
years
who
had
just
set
a
heavy
basket
on
the
floor
madame
domijaiek
i
am
your
humble
servant
rodvard
bergelin
your
son
took
and
myself
in
last
night
to
save
us
from
mother
i
listened
to
the
voice
of
the
heart
as
you
said
piped
the
boy
they
are
good
besides
a
provost
came
and
broke
baron
it
is
well
done
she
placed
a
hand
protectingly
on
his
shoulder
ser
i
am
glad
that
laduis
could
help
you
have
you
breakfasted
i
left
some
of
my
bread
and
cheese
for
them
mother
the
lady
is
a
rodvard
saw
the
woman
s
face
alter
and
her
eyes
which
had
held
only
a
mild
questioning
were
taken
away
from
him
she
fumbled
in
her
laduis
she
said
will
you
get
another
of
millet
from
the
shop
at
the
lalette
came
from
the
bedroom
looking
only
by
the
half
as
delightful
as
rodvard
s
night
memory
painted
her
curtsied
and
said
straightly
madame
i
am
in
your
benevolence
and
honor
so
now
no
concealments
i
am
lalette
asterhax
the
veritable
witch
on
whom
the
provosts
have
set
a
price
and
if
my
being
here
will
trouble
you
i
ll
leave
on
the
instant
but
i
swear
i
have
done
nothing
for
which
i
might
truly
fear
from
a
just
doubt
melted
from
dame
domijaiek
s
face
she
reached
out
both
hands
to
take
the
two
of
the
girl
s
saying
my
dear
i
could
not
let
you
go
from
here
into
danger
for
that
would
not
be
love
but
as
for
your
witchery
we
are
also
told
that
if
one
live
in
the
true
world
the
outer
appearance
of
evil
on
all
of
us
shall
have
no
force
each
must
find
his
own
way
to
love
now
you
shall
tell
me
the
whole
story
while
i
set
forth
something
to
the
girl
gave
it
all
fairly
hiding
nothing
as
they
munched
on
bread
and
cheese
and
pickled
onions
when
she
had
finished
on
the
note
of
mme
kaja
s
treachery
dame
domijaiek
said
ill
done
but
the
poor
woman
s
fault
is
partly
your
said
rodvard
surprised
how
can
that
be
madame
it
takes
more
than
one
to
make
a
murder
if
you
had
been
wholly
ruled
by
the
god
of
love
the
good
will
you
bore
her
could
not
but
have
been
reflected
back
toward
you
was
there
not
something
perhaps
seeming
of
slight
importance
on
which
you
felt
almost
in
fury
with
her
rodvard
flushed
recalling
the
moment
when
mme
kaja
had
burst
in
to
find
them
on
the
bed
but
lalette
said
simply
yes
and
on
a
question
that
most
sharply
brings
angers
to
wit
money
speaking
of
which
have
you
the
spadas
rodvard
why
no
i
reached
for
them
where
they
were
on
the
table
as
we
went
through
the
window
but
they
were
not
there
and
i
thought
you
had
taken
lalette
s
nostrils
moved
a
victory
for
mme
kaja
she
has
left
us
believe
me
an
evident
result
of
the
fact
that
you
quarrelled
with
her
on
pennies
said
dame
domijaiek
rodvard
i
will
not
say
i
disbelieve
you
madame
yet
i
can
not
see
how
this
is
valuable
in
our
present
necessity
the
thing
s
done
now
we
have
to
ask
how
matters
can
be
bettered
and
how
to
carry
word
to
my
good
friend
remigorius
so
that
we
can
elude
the
body
of
this
the
widow
looked
at
him
steadily
and
though
he
was
new
to
this
blue
star
he
felt
surprise
that
he
could
make
out
nothing
at
all
behind
her
eyes
no
thought
whatever
ser
bergelin
she
said
you
will
one
day
learn
that
before
you
can
escape
the
world
s
despairs
you
must
first
escape
the
world
s
self
but
now
you
have
been
sent
to
me
for
help
and
helped
you
shall
be
with
what
i
know
of
i
can
so
alter
your
appearance
that
it
will
not
be
hard
to
pass
a
relaxed
watch
but
will
your
doctor
provide
security
assuredly
said
rodvard
too
quickly
lalette
thought
and
it
was
so
for
he
remembered
the
moment
when
he
surprised
the
doctor
s
mind
his
carelessness
of
what
happened
to
lalette
dame
domijaiek
gave
a
trifling
sigh
you
will
be
safe
here
for
the
time
but
there
is
a
condition
to
my
aid
i
believe
in
a
rule
more
certain
than
yours
of
witchcraft
demoiselle
and
will
ask
that
while
you
are
under
my
roof
you
will
banish
from
your
mind
every
thought
of
evil
and
horror
and
revenge
even
toward
those
who
have
wronged
you
it
is
a
protection
i
ask
for
me
and
my
son
though
you
will
not
believe
iii
by
this
time
it
was
clear
to
both
rodvard
and
lalette
that
as
the
boy
had
said
they
were
certainly
in
the
house
of
a
follower
of
the
prophet
of
mancherei
though
they
did
not
speak
of
it
the
thought
gave
them
both
an
inner
qualm
not
over
being
found
there
but
at
the
thought
of
what
might
be
done
to
their
inner
selves
by
one
of
these
insidious
probers
in
secret
thoughts
who
had
so
misused
their
own
prophet
but
a
mouse
can
not
choose
the
smell
of
the
hole
he
hides
in
they
glanced
at
each
other
and
gave
the
widow
their
word
as
she
had
asked
the
boy
laduis
returned
it
was
thought
better
that
the
pair
be
somewhat
disguised
again
in
case
of
visitors
lalette
kept
the
kjermanash
furs
rodvard
at
first
donned
the
garb
of
an
executioner
but
the
girl
not
liking
him
in
that
took
the
gear
of
a
from
the
ragged
mountains
instead
it
was
a
morning
of
nervous
attent
through
which
they
heard
feet
come
and
go
in
the
apartment
overhead
between
the
promise
to
the
widow
and
their
own
feelings
there
was
hardly
anything
that
could
be
said
of
what
they
wished
to
say
so
they
spent
the
time
listening
to
the
lad
who
told
them
tales
of
his
imagined
people
behind
the
masks
it
would
be
about
the
when
a
man
knocked
who
said
he
was
the
butler
of
the
baroness
stampalia
to
look
at
a
costume
coming
so
quickly
to
the
door
that
rodvard
and
lalette
were
without
time
to
don
and
sought
refuge
in
the
bedroom
this
was
as
well
the
butler
examined
attentively
everything
in
the
outer
room
not
long
later
the
widow
returned
narrowing
her
eyes
over
the
tale
of
the
stampalia
butler
she
has
her
own
dressmaker
could
he
have
been
a
spy
then
to
the
couple
you
see
you
obeyed
my
injunction
as
to
thought
and
were
rodvard
would
have
made
a
point
of
this
but
dame
domijaiek
gave
him
no
time
turning
to
lalette
with
touching
your
mother
my
dear
i
think
you
have
not
to
be
troubled
i
have
not
seen
her
myself
but
the
gossip
is
that
count
cleudi
has
most
generously
sent
her
a
present
of
money
which
is
an
evidence
of
the
working
of
the
god
of
love
though
the
instrument
may
not
be
what
we
would
rodvard
whom
this
style
of
discourse
filled
with
a
discomfort
he
could
not
readily
assay
asked
about
remigorius
the
dame
had
visited
his
shop
she
produced
a
chit
from
the
doctor
which
confirmed
all
rodvard
s
discomforts
on
the
matter
of
lalette
for
it
commanded
him
in
guarded
words
to
come
at
once
and
without
her
lalette
did
not
understand
when
he
showed
her
the
paper
but
she
said
he
must
clearly
go
dame
domijaiek
added
her
voice
to
the
same
purport
saying
that
if
rodvard
were
needed
to
go
elsewhere
lalette
would
be
the
safer
there
for
hiding
alone
from
a
cabinet
she
brought
some
of
the
false
hair
used
on
masks
and
skillfully
affixed
a
fur
of
it
to
rodvard
s
face
while
lalette
suddenly
gay
changed
the
dress
of
his
head
and
added
a
ribbon
that
make
him
quite
a
different
person
he
kissed
her
farewell
the
widow
simpered
as
though
it
were
she
who
had
been
saluted
and
said
she
would
offer
an
answerable
prayer
to
the
god
of
love
for
the
success
of
his
going
sedad
vix
a
new
life
the
doorman
did
not
glance
from
his
lazy
the
provost
on
guard
at
the
street
entrance
was
equally
indifferent
as
rodvard
went
past
feeling
a
trifle
unreal
after
so
long
close
indoors
remigorius
was
compounding
a
philter
with
mortar
and
pestle
he
hailed
rodvard
almost
boisterously
laughing
over
the
figure
he
made
in
his
false
facial
hair
what
will
you
have
a
career
as
a
ladies
now
that
you
ve
turned
seducer
by
profession
well
i
have
summoned
you
here
because
things
mount
to
a
crisis
the
court
s
finance
is
utterly
broke
and
the
high
center
holds
that
we
must
move
fast
for
though
there
are
stirrings
in
the
west
it
seems
they
move
in
the
direction
of
said
rodvard
we
are
likely
to
be
broke
ourselves
mme
kaja
s
a
pestle
stopped
in
mortar
the
doctor
s
face
seemed
to
narrow
over
the
midnight
thicket
of
his
beard
and
a
soft
pink
tongue
came
out
to
run
a
circlet
round
his
lips
i
ll
mix
that
bitch
a
draft
will
burn
her
guts
out
give
me
the
rodvard
told
it
all
plainly
with
the
hiding
on
the
rooftop
and
the
household
of
the
amorosian
woman
over
which
last
remigorius
eye
held
some
anxiety
the
one
who
came
here
you
did
not
tell
her
of
our
fellowship
these
people
of
the
prophet
s
rule
lie
as
close
together
as
so
many
snowflakes
and
though
they
re
as
deep
against
the
court
as
we
i
would
not
trust
them
but
touching
your
affair
of
the
old
he
placed
one
finger
to
his
cheek
and
held
his
eyes
averted
so
that
rodvard
could
not
see
where
his
true
thought
lay
re
too
censorious
i
see
no
real
treason
there
she
s
deep
in
double
intrigues
and
must
keep
up
an
appearance
beside
which
no
doubt
there
is
something
of
an
old
woman
s
for
a
younger
man
it
may
all
have
been
by
order
of
the
high
center
indeed
you
d
certainly
have
been
saved
yourself
by
some
tale
for
you
are
now
too
valuable
now
for
our
affair
you
are
to
take
the
stage
at
dawning
for
sedad
vix
where
you
are
to
be
writer
for
count
cleudi
at
the
conference
of
rodvard
s
eyes
sprang
open
wide
the
court
will
i
not
be
known
ah
nya
you
re
not
involved
now
in
this
pursuit
of
the
provosts
the
only
one
that
could
establish
your
communion
with
the
witch
is
cared
would
that
be
your
pensionnario
doorman
an
accident
happened
to
him
last
night
but
one
was
found
in
the
river
this
morning
thoroughly
dead
and
green
as
a
remigorius
waved
a
hand
goodbye
to
udo
the
crab
and
whipped
to
his
main
theme
the
conference
of
court
florestan
the
chancellor
the
army
restive
for
want
of
pay
the
revenues
hypothecated
the
question
of
a
great
assembly
cleudi
intriguing
the
time
come
for
all
terrible
measures
but
mathurin
can
discover
all
this
as
clearly
as
i
said
rodvard
a
little
quickfire
of
suspicion
running
through
him
better
in
the
open
but
we
d
know
the
secret
purposes
and
whom
to
trust
mathurin

cleudi
to
be
a
spy
for
the
regent
of
tritulacca
despite
his
ejection
from

councils
there
is
it
true
you

they

reputation
too
exalted

by
chance
in
prince
pavinius
service
seeking
to
place
that
saint
on
the
throne
as
prince
and
prophet
both
together
a
thousand
such
questions

play
in
high
politics
young
man
and
earn
yourself
a
rodvard
heart
beating
said
well
what
do
you
ask
more
his
mind
made
up
with
a
snap
and
as
though
the
words
came
from
someone
else
two
things
to
write
a
letter
to
demoiselle
asterhax
who
will
be
expecting
my
return
and
to
know
how
i
am
to
reach
sedad

without
a
remigorius
shot
him
a
glance
hit
and
past
in
which
there
was
annoyance
and
something
like
a
drop
of
ink
about
lalette
what

without
money

a

drew
from
his
pouch

exact
amount
as
for

paper
i

charge
myself
with
the
rodvard
wrote
his
letter
discussed
through
a
falling
light
what
persons
might
be
watched
at
the
villa
by
the
sea
and
how
to
give
the
news
to
mathurin
dined
miserably
with
the
doctor
on
a
stew
that
had
the
sharp
taste
of
meat
kept
beyond
its
time
and
lay
down
exhausted
on
the
floor
with
a
couple
of
cushions
and
his
cloak
sleep
withheld
its
hand
his
mind
kept
running
in
a
circle
round
the
thought
of
being
a
controller
of
destinies
until
he
made
up
a
land
of
in
his
head
of
being
accuser
before
a
court
of
the
people
with
some
man
who
bore
a
great
name
as
the
accused
and
himself
making
a
but
you
your
lordship
are
a
liar
and
a
traitor
what
of
your
secret
adhesion
to
the
prophet
the
scene
he
could
fix
clearly
with
the
accused
s
face
and
the
members
of
the
court
looking
grim
as
the
accusation
was
driven
home
but
somehow
the
people
of
his
drama
would
not
move
around
or
change
expression
beyond
this
one
point
and
each
time
he
reached
it
the
whole
thing
ended
in
a
white
flash
and
he
drifted
for
a
while
between
sleeping
and
waking
wondering
whether
his
blue
star
might
not
be
driving
him
foolish
until
the
imagined
play
began
again
without
any
will
of
his
own
toward
day
he
must
have
slept
a
little
for
remigorius
was
laying
a
cold
hand
on
his
face
and
it
was
time
to
look
toward
the
new
day
and
new
life
ii
from
the
city
to
sedad
vix
by
the
shore
is
a
fair
twelve
leagues
through
the
most
fertile
fields
in
all
dossola
now
jumping
with
new
green
orchards
blooming
in
a
row
and
pale
yellow
jonquils
another
time
rodvard
had
found
the
trip
after
they
crossed
the
high
bridge
pure
pleasure
but
now
he
felt
having
missed
his
sleep
and
the
in
the
opposite
seat
was
a
pregnant
woman
who
said
she
was
going
to
join
her
husband
and
babbled
on
about
his
position
in
the
royal
orchestra
till
one
could
not
even
doze
the
blue
star
said
coldly
that
she
was
a
liar
and
talking
to
hide
the
true
fact
namely
that
she
hated
her
husband
and
pregnancy
and
the
love
of
any
man
and
as
soon
as
she
was
free
of
her
condition
hoped
to
catch
the
eye
of
some
wealthy
lady
and
to
be
maintained
for
pleasures
vile
a
thought
that
rodvard
closed
his
eyes
the
man
next
to
him
was
a
merchant
of
some
kind
by
the
badge
in
his
cap
he
kept
addressing
compliments
to
the
dame
saying
that
he
would
dance
with
her
at
the
spring
festival
and
the
like
rodvard
turning
could
see
he
thought
her
licentious
and
was
determined
to
profit
by
it
at
some
future
time
at
masjon
where
they
stopped
for
lunch
the
bought
a
whole
roasted
chicken
and
a
bottle
of
that
fine
white
tritulaccan
wine
which
is
called
the
honey
of
the
hills
rodvard
himself
was
a
little
faint
from
lack
of
food
when
he
reached
the
royal
villa
after
a
solid
of
trudging
beyond
the
nor
did
the
who
received
him
offer
food
but
took
him
at
once
to
a
cabinet
looking
out
over
a
terraced
at
the
back
of
the
rambling
building
this
guide
said
to
wait
for
the
arrival
of
ser
tuolén
the
the
name
had
a
kjermanash
sound
and
sure
enough
the
tall
man
who
came
after
perhaps
half
an
hour
s
retard
had
the
nose
and
curling
hair
of
that
northern
land
rodvard
stood
to
greet
him
with
extended
hand
and
as
he
looked
into
the
eyes
received
a
shock
that
ran
through
him
like
with
its
indubitable
message
that
he
was
facing
another
wearer
of
the
blue
star
you
are
ser
bergelin
the
eyes
looked
at
him
fixedly
though
the
lips
did
not
cease
smiling
what
is
your
function
to
be
writer
to
the
count
cleudi
for
the
conference
rodvard
managed
to
say
one
almost
seemed
to
drown
in
those
eyes
liquid
and
northern
blue
but
he
could
not
read
a
single
thought
behind
them
the
smile
expanded
you
will
find
it
easier
to
meet
others
who
when
you
have
borne
that
stone
for
a
time
i
perceive
it
is
a
novelty
to
you
there
are
not
many
of
us
suppose
it
is
little
use
asking
you
why
count
cleudi
wishes
a
blue
star
with
him
no
matter
i
have
watched
him
before
and
it
is
no
secret
that
he
wishes
to
be
chancellor
even
lord
florestan
knows
that
i
trust
you
are
not
an
amorosian
or
one
of
that
band
of
assassins
who
call
themselves
sons
of
the
new
day
no
said
rodvard
and
thought
with
the
back
of
his
mind
that
this
was
why
all
plans
to
deal
directly
with
the
court
had
broken
and
others
of
the
brotherhood
been
laid
in
the
toils
of
the
provosts
this
here
with
the
front
of
his
thought
he
concentrated
on
looking
at
the
detail
in
the
painting
of
a
milkmaid
just
beyond
tuolén
s
ear
the
turned
it
is
by
raubasco
he
was
not
satisfied
with
the
highlights
in
the
middle
distance
as
i
discovered
by
a
means
you
will
understand
so
it
was
easy
to
persuade
the
painting
away
from
him
do
you
intend
to
bring
your
wife
no
said
rodvard
thinking
quickly
on
lalette
and
as
quickly
away
oh
there
is
something
wrong
with
the
personal
relation
perhaps
it
is
just
as
well
if
you
do
not
her
majesty
is
not
prudish
but
she
does
not
approve
of
witches
at
the
court
your
room
will
be
at
the
depth
of
the
west
wing
beyond
the
hall
of
conference
i
will
have
one
of
the
show
he
stood
up
then
paused
with
one
hand
holding
the
one
last
word
a
bearer
finds
himself
in
a
strange
position
here
without
his
witch
i
suppose
your
wife
has
given
you
the
usual
warning
about
infidelity
but
you
are
clearly
new
to
the
jewel
and
young
and
there
are
not
a
few
ladies
who
might
make
the
loss
seem
worth
the
you
can
read
their
desires
in
particular
i
warn
you
to
stand
clear
of
the
countess
aiella
of
arjen
in
whom
i
have
noted
something
of
the
kind
she
is
involved
with
the
duke
of
aggermans
a
man
who
ll
protect
his
own
dangerously
drop
in
tomorrow
night
after
cleudi
releases
you
it
will
be
a
pleasure
to
compare
things
seen
with
another
bearer
i
have
not
met
one
for
in
the
room
was
a
tray
of
food
on
the
table
ample
and
well
selected
with
a
bottle
of
wine
three
or
four
books
also
but
they
were
all
and
of
a
kind
rodvard
found
it
difficult
to
bear
even
when
well
written
as
these
hardly
were
he
glanced
at
each
in
turn
then
tossed
them
aside
and
was
only
rescued
from
boredom
by
mathurin
s
coming
who
pressed
his
hands
and
said
he
would
come
the
next
evening
again
but
for
the
now
he
must
hurry
rodvard
replied
that
the
high
butler
tuolén
was
the
bearer
of
a
star
and
mathurin
must
either
avoid
his
eye
or
keep
his
own
thought
on
innocuous
subjects
and
his
witch
wait
no
that
explains
i
do
not
see
said
rodvard
why
fool
the
hold
the
court
party
has
no
sooner
a
man
turns
up
that
s
in
opposition
than
your
tuolén
knows
his
most
secret
purpose
and
i
do
not
doubt
that
his
wife
witches
the
man
this
is
something
for
the
high
center
of
the
new
iii
a
pretty
maid
brought
him
breakfast
in
bed
she
gave
him
a
cheerful
morning
greeting
but
embarrassed
him
by
hoping
in
her
thought
that
he
would
not
make
love
to
her
her
mind
held
some
memory
of
how
the
last
man
in
this
room
had
done
so
but
she
shied
from
the
thought
of
the
outcome
so
much
that
instead
of
decently
avoiding
her
look
rodvard
was
tempted
to
pry
deeper
but
there
was
hardly
time
she
said
it
would
be
near
to
noon
when
count
cleudi
rose
and
that
his
apartment
was
in
one
of
the
pavilions
set
among
tree
and
shrub
and
garden
west
from
the
main
villa
rodvard
dressed
and
went
to
stroll
in
that
direction
through
curved
avenues
among
intricate
beds
of
spring
and
narcissus
with
pink
azaleas
just
in
the
bud
beside
them
and
magnolia
showing
its
heavy
white
wax
the
pathways
had
been
laid
out
so
that
each
sweep
brought
somewhere
into
view
through
trees
the
pale
blue
bay
with
the
white
houses
of
sedad
vix
climbing
the
slope
beyond
their
walls
touched
to
gold
by
genial
sunshine
bright
yellow
birds
were
singing
overhead
or
busily
gathering
morsels
for
their
nests
rodvard
felt
his
heart
expanding
with
a
joyous
certainty
that
all
would
yet
be
well
though
in
the
same
tick
demanding
of
himself
how
men
who
dwelt
in
such
surroundings
could
be
given
to
evil
and
oppression
ah
if
all
people
could
only
walk
in
gardens
daily
a
question
in
philosophy
to
put
to
the
before
he
could
frame
it
into
words
a
turn
of
the
path
brought
him
past
a
tall
clump
of
rhododendrons
to
the
front
of
a
pavilion
where
a
gardener
was
letting
into
the
ground
plants
of
blooming
hyacinth
the
air
was
rich
with
their
fragrance
good
morning
to
you
said
rodvard
cheerfully
for
joy
of
the
world
the
man
looked
up
with
lips
that
turned
down
at
the
corners
if
you
say
it
is
a
good
morning
i
suppose
it
must
be
one
for
you
he
said
and
turned
back
to
his
trowel
why
i
would
call
it
the
best
of
mornings
does
not
the
fine
air
of
it
please
you
then
what
s
amiss
have
you
troubles
who
has
not
the
gardener
slapped
his
trowel
against
the
ground
beside
his
latest
plant
look
at
these
flowers
now
just
smell
that
white
one
there
it
s
more
fragrant
than
the
blue
aren
t
they
beautiful
things
brought
here
at
expense
and
in
this
soil
see
how
black
it
is
they
would
grow
more
perfect
than
ever
year
by
year
but
here
s
the
end
of
them
as
soon
as
the
blossoms
fade
ever
so
little
poor
things
they
must
be
dug
up
and
thrown
away
because
he
swung
his
head
and
rolled
an
eye
in
the
direction
of
the
pavilion
t
bear
to
have
any
but
blooming
flowers
at
her
door
and
will
want
new
who
is
she
asked
rodvard
lowering
his
tone
for
fear
that
voices
will
sometimes
carry
through
wood
the
countess
aiella
her
affair
you
will
be
saying
whether
flowers
die
or
live
she
has
all
that
income
from
the
arjen
estates
and
doesn
t
have
to
provide
for
her
brothers
who
married
those
two
heiresses
up
in
bregatz
but
a
man
could
still
weep
for
the
waste
of
the
flowers
ser
give
a
thought
to
it
how
in
the
world
we
never
have
enough
of
beauty
and
those
who
destroy
any
part
of
it
take
something
from
all
other
people
is
it
not
true
now
he
paused
on
his
knees
and
looked
up
at
rodvard
who
was
growing
interested
indeed
but
now
felt
the
coldness
of
the
blue
star
telling
him
that
this
earthy
philosopher
was
not
thinking
of
beauty
at
all
but
only
reciting
a
lesson
and
wondering
whether
his
pretty
speech
might
not
draw
him
a
gift
from
this
young
man
i
do
not
doubt
it
he
said
but
i
have
no
money
to
give
away
and
turned
to
go
but
he
had
not
travelled
a
dozen
paces
when
he
met
one
who
must
be
the
countess
aiella
herself
by
the
little
double
coronet
in
her
hat
rodvard
doffed
to
the
coronet
noting
in
the
fleeting
second
of
his
bow
the
passionate
bewildering
beauty
of
the
face
surrounded
by
curves
of
hair
she
stopped
put
it
on
she
said
and
he
looked
up
at
her
the
cloak
did
not
conceal
the
fact
that
she
was
still
dressed
for
evening
a
leg
showed
through
the
slit
in
her
dress
i
have
not
seen
you
no
your
grace
i
only
arrived
last
your
badge
says
you
are
a
i
am
a
writer
to
the
count
cleudi
for
this
he
dared
to
look
into
the
eyes
a
length
below
his
own
behind
them
there
was
boredom
with
a
faint
flicker
of
interest
in
himself
and
the
thought
of
having
spent
a
bad
night
a
weary
thought
count
cleudi
oh
you
might
be
him
in
she
laughed
a
laugh
that
trilled
up
the
scale
slipped
past
him
with
a
motion
as
lithe
as
a
gazelle
s
and
up
the
path
into
the
pavilion
rodvard
looked
after
her
until
he
heard
the
gardener
cackle
then
a
little
angry
with
himself
stamped
on
round
the
turn
of
the
path
trying
to
recover
the
glory
of
the
morning
some
of
it
came
back
but
not
enough
to
prevent
him
thinking
more
on
the
comparison
between
this
countess
and
lalette
than
the
difference
between
this
day
and
any
other
day
and
so
he
reached
cleudi
s
door
with
its
device
of
a
fishing
bird
carved
into
the
wood
mathurin
greeted
him
properly
in
words
to
show
he
and
rodvard
barely
had
met
each
other
the
pavilion
was
all
on
one
floor
the
count
in
a
room
at
the
side
with
a
man
doing
his
hair
while
he
sipped
hot
spiced
wine
from
which
a
delicious
odor
floated
rodvard
had
heard
of
but
never
seen
this
famous
exile
and
intriguer
he
looked
into
a
narrow
face
with
a
broad
brow
above
a
sharp
nose
and
lips
that
spoke
of
mathurin
pronounced
the
name
of
the
new
writer
a
pair
of
dark
eyes
looked
at
rodvard
broodingly
the
thought
behind
them
wondering
what
his
weakness
was
and
how
he
would
cheat
said
cleudi
i
do
not
ask
your
earlier
employment
since
it
is
of
no
moment
if
you
are
faithful
and
intelligent
i
can
not
bear
stupidity
can
you
read
tritulaccan
yes
your
you
will
gain
nothing
by
attempting
to
flatter
me
with
the
form
of
address
on
the
side
table
are
pens
and
papers
also
a
horoscope
which
has
been
cast
in
tritulaccan
and
a
poem
in
your
own
musical
language
make
fair
copies
of
both
in
dossolan
have
you
breakfasted
his
accent
had
the
slight
overemphasis
on
s
which
no
tritulaccan
ever
loses
yes
thank
the
symbols
on
the
astrological
chart
were
new
to
rodvard
he
had
to
copy
each
by
sheer
drawing
and
then
translate
the
terms
as
best
he
might
the
poem
was
a
sonnet
in
praise
of
a
lady
its
meter
limped
at
two
points
rodvard
managed
to
correct
one
of
them
by
a
transposition
of
words
and
presently
laid
both
papers
before
cleudi
who
knit
his
brows
over
them
for
a
moment
and
smiled
you
are
a
very
daring
writer
to
improve
on
what
i
have
set
down
but
it
is
well
done
mathurin
give
him
a
scuderius
well
then
you
are
to
wait
on
me
in
the
conference
at
nine
glasses
of
the
afternoon
everything
i
say
is
to
be
set
down
and
also
the
remarks
of
the
chancellor
florestan
but
most
especially
those
of
the
baron
brunivar
for
these
may
be
of
future
use
of
the
others
whatever
you
yourself
consider
worth
while
you
are
mathurin
saw
him
to
the
door
the
scuderius
asked
rodvard
goes
into
the
treasury
of
our
center
said
the
servitor
but
i
have
no
money
no
money
at
all
protested
rodvard
pish
you
do
not
need
it
here
would
you
starve
our
high
purpose
to
feed
your
personal
pleasure
in
little
things
i
will
come
to
your
room
high
politic
although
the
day
was
bright
outside
little
light
could
seep
through
the
leaded
panes
and
what
little
light
there
was
had
been
cut
off
by
heavily
looped
curtains
there
were
candles
down
the
long
table
and
in
brackets
on
the
walls
in
the
marble
fireplace
at
the
high
end
of
the
room
a
small
flame
smouldered
under
the
stone
cupids
before
it
three
men
were
standing
with
goes
of
brandy
in
their
hands
baron
brunivar
was
recognizable
by
his
with
a
mane
of
white
hair
and
a
mouth
that
made
one
think
of
the
word
nobility
without
reference
to
civil
condition
he
was
talking
with
a
short
round
man
who
looked
as
jolly
as
he
could
possibly
be
and
a
dark
lord
who
held
a
kitten
in
his
arm
till
the
little
thing
struggled
to
be
set
down
whereupon
it
played
round
his
feet
catching
for
the
in
spite
of
his
solemnity
this
would
be
florestan
the
laughing
chancellor
he
was
known
to
favor
cats
in
a
moment
he
looked
around
and
signed
to
tuolén
the
head
butler
who
rapped
a
little
silver
bell
on
the
table
all
the
men
from
various
corners
of
the
room
gathered
three
of
them
were
episcopals
in
their
violet
robes
with
flowers
of
office
florestan
quietly
waited
till
all
were
at
rest
his
visage
in
calm
lines
but
rodvard
could
see
just
enough
of
his
eyes
to
catch
an
intimation
that
this
might
be
a
grim
business
he
tapped
the
bell
once
more
my
lords
if
you
were
ignorant
of
this
convocation
s
purpose
you
had
not
been
summoned
therefore
let
us
leave
all
preliminaries
and
turn
straight
to
the
matter
of
her
majesty
s
pause
the
man
said
what
s
there
to
say
of
it
that
it
is
a
very
dangerous
thing
to
have
the
court
in
poverty
when
we
are
threatened
with
this
question
of
the
the
faces
along
the
table
watched
him
attentively
all
set
in
varying
degrees
of
stubbornness
and
as
the
kitten
scratched
at
the
leg
of
his
chair
he
reached
down
to
pet
it
my
lords
this
has
now
grown
so
grave
that
we
can
dissolve
our
troubles
only
by
measures
never
taken
before
all
the
old
means
eaten
up
yet
we
still
want
money
to
pay
her
majesty
s
army
which
is
not
only
a
disgraceful
thing
but
also
a
perilous
those
who
should
protect
us
may
become
our
the
little
round
man
s
smile
was
jolly
as
before
his
voice
not
your
grace
a
bug
close
to
the
eye
may
look
as
big
as
a
lion
is
there
proof
of
true
disaffection
a
man
with
hair
and
the
of
a
general
on
his
silk
nodded
gloomily
i
bear
such
proof
this
brawl
among
the
red
archers
of
veierelden
has
been
given
a
light
appearance
but
my
men
have
looked
into
it
and
it
runs
deeper
than
you
think
namely
they
were
shouting
for
the
restoration
of
pavinius
to
the
succession
we
hanged
one
of
his
emissaries
a
mayern
pah
said
the
round
man
since
he
was
exiled
every
ruction
has
been
a
shout
for
his
return
they
do
not
mean
dossola
will
never
bear
a
king
who
is
himself
the
leader
of
a
sect
opposed
to
true
religion
observed
one
of
the
episcopals
even
his
followers
of
the
amorosian
faith
have
rejected
florestan
held
up
his
hand
my
lords
you
wander
i
summoned
you
here
on
this
matter
of
finance
to
say
that
it
is
within
the
powers
granted
to
me
as
minister
by
the
queen
s
majesty
to
establish
by
decree
the
new
form
of
proposed
by
our
good
friend
the
count
cleudi
yet
as
some
of
you
have
been
good
enough
to
let
me
know
this
plan
will
never
succeed
i
now
ask
what
other
you
it
is
a
plan
to
steal
from
the
nobles
of
the
land
and
it
will
surely
not
be
borne
said
a
man
with
great
force
said
one
of
the
episcopals
the
estates
of
the
church
must
of
course
be
exempt
from
this
plan
for
it
would
be
an
affront
to
the
most
high
god
to
make
his
spiritual
ministers
into
for
the
lesser
or
civil
chancellor
florestan
threw
back
his
head
with
a
burst
of
laughter
so
heartily
sustained
that
it
was
not
hard
to
see
how
he
had
won
his
the
same
spiritual
ministers
he
said
have
little
trouble
with
their
consciences
when
it
is
a
question
of
collecting
taxes
to
their
own
benefit
no
i
do
not
contemplate
that
the
lords
episcopal
shall
be
exempt
however
ill
that
sits
and
i
tell
you
plainly
that
i
will
enforce
this
plan
with
every
strength
there
is
come
my
lords
you
waste
my
time
which
belongs
to
the
queen
and
so
dissipate
her
resources
i
ask
again
who
has
a
sharper
scheme
than
cleudi
s
now
they
burst
in
on
him
with
a
flood
of
words
like
so
many
dogs
barking
which
he
hardly
seemed
to
hear
as
he
leaned
down
to
pet
the
kitten
rodvard
watching
the
calm
indifferent
face
could
not
catch
a
clear
vision
of
the
eyes
in
the
candlelight
and
flow
of
movement
he
saw
tuolén
advance
to
pick
up
one
of
the
glasses
with
his
eyes
fixed
on
the
horsefaced
lord
who
had
been
so
vehement
and
it
came
to
him
that
florestan
must
know
there
was
another
blue
star
in
the
room
and
be
concealing
his
thought
from
reading
the
chancellor
reached
over
to
tap
his
bell
once
more
we
will
hear
the
baron
brunivar
he
said
the
lord
he
mentioned
turned
a
stately
head
but
though
he
was
squarely
in
face
rodvard
could
only
make
out
a
thought
troubled
and
urgent
nothing
definite
your
grace
he
said
when
i
first
learned
of
this
plan
i
thought
it
was
put
forward
merely
to
provoke
a
better
now
i
see
that
it
is
not
and
though
i
have
no
plan
for
raising
more
money
only
for
spending
less
i
ask
you
to
think
what
will
happen
if
you
persist
in
it
more
taxes
can
not
be
borne
by
the
commonalty
they
ll
rise
and
you
ll
have
prince
pavinius
over
the
border
with
a
mayern
army
at
his
the
laughing
chancellor
turned
his
head
and
said
to
his
own
writer
at
the
side
table
be
it
noted
that
baron
brunivar
spoke
of
treason
and
wars
in
the
west
where
his
seignory
white
eyebrows
flashed
up
and
down
over
brunivar
s
orbits
you
shall
not
make
me
a
traitor
so
your
grace
i
have
stood
in
the
battlefield
against
this
pavinius
when
he
was
prophet
of
mancherei
with
all
tritulacca
to
aid
him
and
there
were
some
who
he
looked
along
the
table
it
is
not
exterior
war
i
fear
but
dossolans
at
each
others
throats
and
an
unpaid
army
against
florestan
s
voice
tolled
write
it
down
that
the
baron
brunivar
doubts
the
army
s
loyalty
to
her
brunivar
s
face
became
a
grimace
but
he
plunged
on
let
me
beg
your
grace
could
not
enough
be
saved
on
the
household
budget
for
the
spring
festival
to
keep
the
army
happy
for
long
write
it
down
that
the
baron
brunivar
declares
her
majesty
to
be
i
ll
say
no
more
you
have
my
completest
said
cleudi
lightly
i
thank
you
my
lord
brunivar
for
having
shown
that
no
plan
but
mine
will
brunivar
s
mouth
flew
open
and
shut
again
said
one
of
the
episcopals
let
us
think
if
there
be
not
another
plan
i
have
heard
that
in
some
of
the
estates
of
kjermanash
when
extraordinary
measures
are
needed
they
have
a
tax
on
flour
which
is
levied
at
the
mill
most
collectible
since
no
one
can
avoid
it
if
he
wishes
to
eat
bread
could
not
a
similar
be
laid
here
florestan
s
lips
twitched
brunivar
struck
the
table
i
said
i
d
done
but
this
outdoes
all
my
lord
in
the
west
it
is
exactly
that
our
people
have
not
coppers
enough
both
to
buy
bread
and
pay
their
present
taxes
that
has
roused
our
troubles
will
you
starve
them
the
little
fat
man
said
yet
the
present
revenues
are
not
a
general
murmur
brunivar
stood
up
in
his
place
at
the
table
my
lords
he
said
i
am
forced
to
this
issue
the
burden
lies
not
on
the
court
alone
but
on
all
of
you
the
popular
can
pay
no
more
whatever
comes
must
come
from
our
estates
it
has
been
so
since
the
tritulaccan
war
and
the
loss
of
the
mancherei
revenues
that
kept
us
all
in
luxury
we
in
the
western
seignories
have
made
some
sacrifice
toward
the
happiness
of
our
people
out
of
free
will
and
the
love
of
humankind
we
have
been
without
the
troubles
that
vex
such
seignories
as
yours
your
grace
of
he
looked
at
the
round
man
without
witchings
and
this
i
think
is
because
we
show
some
love
for
those
we
cleudi
lifted
his
hand
for
speech
and
the
chancellor
signed
to
him
he
said
i
speak
here
under
permission
being
a
foreigner
and
not
familiar
with
these
new
religions
that
have
vexed
and
divided
the
ancient
realm
of
dossola
and
its
former
dominion
overseas
i
would
ask
whether
the
baron
brunivar
s
talk
of
love
for
humankind
places
him
more
definitely
with
the
amorosians
who
follow
the
first
doctrine
of
the
or
with
those
who
now
accept
his
word
head
bent
to
set
down
these
words
rodvard
did
not
catch
a
glimpse
of
brunivar
s
face
at
this
accusation
but
he
heard
the
quick
gasp
of
breath
that
was
covered
by
florestan
s
laughter
the
chancellor
said
my
lords
and
of
baron
brunivar
s
accusation
i
think
this
most
happily
clears
the
air
you
see
where
the
true
resistance
to
count
cleudi
s
plan
for
taxes
lies
and
on
what
ground
will
you
make
yourselves
one
with
that
purpose
which
is
clearly
nothing
but
the
establishment
over
us
of
pavinius
and
his
form
of
witchcraft
his
eyes
swept
the
table
and
the
noble
lords
and
episcopals
stirred
in
their
seats
but
nobody
said
a
word
now
i
ll
add
more
you
are
jealous
of
your
privilege
my
lords
as
to
this
new
plan
and
fear
the
government
will
be
the
only
gainer
by
no
means
it
is
only
a
device
of
finance
which
will
in
the
end
work
favorably
for
all
you
are
charged
with
the
taxes
due
from
your
seignories
yes
but
when
this
happens
there
is
created
a
class
of
financial
paper
which
having
value
can
be
bought
and
sold
i
mean
the
warrants
drawn
by
the
court
on
you
for
the
good
her
majesty
s
government
will
sell
these
warrants
at
discount
to
zigraners
and
others
who
love
to
speculate
there
s
a
fine
speculation
for
instance
will
the
tax
on
the
province
of
aggermans
yield
twice
what
it
did
last
the
half
thus
the
paper
will
change
hands
but
at
every
change
of
ownership
in
the
paper
the
government
takes
a
small
tax
on
the
transaction
small
enough
not
to
discourage
the
purchase
and
sale
thus
we
are
provided
instantly
with
the
full
treasury
we
must
have
obtaining
it
from
the
sale
of
the
warrants
and
at
the
same
time
we
have
a
steady
source
of
income
while
you
my
lords
lose
the
small
fat
man
who
had
identified
himself
as
the
duke
of
aggermans
spoke
up
it
all
sounds
very
well
but
why
must
the
nobles
of
the
realm
be
converted
into
as
though
we
had
zigraner
blood
what
can
you
not
cheat
the
speculators
as
well
by
selling
them
paper
on
taxes
collected
direct
in
the
name
of
the
queen
the
laughing
chancellor
flung
out
a
hand
why
touching
your
first
question
my
lord
you
ll
be
no
more
a
than
you
are
today
only
the
agents
who
now
speak
in
her
majesty
s
name
will
be
by
degrees
transferred
to
your
service
from
this
you
ll
benefit
for
some
of
these
taxes
will
be
paid
in
early
and
you
will
have
the
handling
of
the
monies
until
the
government
s
paper
against
you
falls
due
as
to
the
second
why
if
we
are
to
enlist
the
speculators
to
our
work
it
must
surely
be
through
having
papers
of
different
values
which
go
up
and
down
from
one
seignory
to
another
instead
of
all
being
equal
as
the
government
s
own
obligation
the
general
said
the
monies
must
come
soon
if
we
re
to
have
peace
with
the
florestan
stood
the
session
may
be
considered
ii
outside
the
hall
it
was
a
shock
to
come
into
bright
flowers
and
green
the
sun
was
just
plunging
down
behind
the
low
green
hills
westward
the
birds
singing
and
everything
in
perfect
peace
not
a
leaf
in
movement
tuolén
the
butler
tapped
rodvard
on
the
shoulder
and
when
they
were
together
in
his
cabinet
brought
forth
a
bottle
of
kjermanash
ceriso
held
it
up
to
contemplate
the
ruby
glow
against
the
falling
light
and
poured
into
goblets
of
crystal
you
found
it
diverting
ser
bergelin
his
grace
is
very
rodvard
sipping
perceived
that
a
reply
was
asked
did
he
convince
them
then
where
were
your
eyes
ah
over
your
papers
but
surely
you
saw
enough
to
know
that
conviction
was
beyond
his
grace
s
purpose
the
lords
episcopal
will
never
be
convinced
the
lords
militant
are
convinced
already
did
you
watch
brunivar
when
cleudi
accused
him
of
being
a
follower
of
pavinius
whether
as
prince
or
prophet
no
i
was
it
would
have
been
worth
your
trouble
there
was
that
something
like
a
golden
flash
which
always
comes
when
a
man
discovers
that
what
he
has
said
in
innocency
may
be
taken
as
the
product
of
a
guilty
guilty
rodvard
s
surprise
broke
through
the
guard
he
had
set
on
his
thought
i
am
new
to
this
blue
star
but
saw
no
guilt
only
an
honest
man
who
would
help
the
butler
s
permanent
smile
came
up
out
of
his
crystal
honest
honest
i
imagine
brunivar
may
answer
to
that
a
tradesman
s
quality
at
best
i
look
for
it
in
dealers
who
furnish
the
court
with
pork
but
in
high
policy
that
type
will
hardly
gain
one
more
than
a
length
of
cold
it
will
now
do
for
rodvard
looked
down
his
grace
was
playing
a
game
with
brunivar
to
make
this
public
confession
that
he
is
either
an
amorosian
or
a
follower
of
the
prince
as
you
clearly
discovered
the
episcopals
can
never
let
that
fall
they
can
no
more
have
a
man
of
such
opinions
as
than
they
could
have
pavinius
for
king
so
now
there
will
be
an
accusation
and
a
trial
and
brunivar
walking
the
walk
to
meet
the
on
the
scaffold
for
i
doubt
they
can
afford
banishment
not
while
her
majesty
insists
on
carrying
through
the
old
king
s
will
that
makes
brunivar
for
his
honesty
if
the
throne
falls
vacant
but
mark
the
astuteness
of
his
grace
who
at
the
same
time
destroys
the
popular
party
by
taking
off
its
best
leader
but
i
do
not
think
more
will
be
until
after
the
spring
festival
since
to
condemn
brunivar
now
would
give
him
the
cancellation
of
punishments
which
the
festival
he
gave
a
grunting
laugh
drained
his
ceriso
refilled
his
own
goblet
and
brought
rodvard
s
up
to
the
brim
while
the
latter
s
thoughts
whirled
wildly
to
cover
which
he
asked
the
short
man
always
smiling
though
he
spoke
so
sourly
was
the
duke
of
aggermans
yes
one
to
watch
i
have
caught
him
thinking
of
schemes
by
which
he
may
one
day
reach
the
chancellor
s
seat
that
is
why
he
opposes
cleudi
ser
why
are
you
so
deep
in
turmoil
of
mind
suppose
it
must
have
something
to
do
with
baron
brunivar
said
rodvard
not
daring
to
try
to
conceal
i
have
always
heard
him
well
spoke
of
as
a
man
who
thinks
of
the
benefit
of
others
than
the
steady
smile
became
a
chuckle
so
he
does
these
are
the
most
dangerous
kind
in
politic
the
next
step
beyond
thinking
on
the
good
of
others
is
deciding
what
that
good
will
be
a
privilege
reserved
to
god
but
is
not
his
grace
astute
yet
it
seems
to
me
shocking
that
a
man
who
has
done
no
ah
i
see
where
you
lead
ser
bergelin
wrong
is
not
in
acts
alone
or
else
every
soldier
would
be
a
criminal
but
in
the
thoughts
with
which
they
are
he
tapped
the
jacket
just
over
his
heart
where
the
blue
star
would
hang
and
for
the
first
time
the
smile
left
his
face
when
you
have
borne
one
of
these
baubles
as
long
as
i
you
will
learn
that
few
of
us
are
different
from
the
rest
i
saw
a
man
in
a
dungeon
once
a
murderer
whose
thoughts
were
better
than
those
of
the
deacon
who
gave
him
consolation
to
my
mind
that
is
you
or
another
might
take
those
same
thoughts
for
hideous
take
now
your
baron
brunivar
who
seems
so
lofty
to
you
because
on
one
range
of
topic
his
desires
chime
with
your
own
yet
you
are
not
his
identical
watch
him
i
say
and
you
will
find
his
gold
more
than
half
brass
in
another
light
wrong
right
i
do
not
know
what
value
they
have
to
one
who
wears
the
blue
iii
let
conscience
die
the
hours
wheeled
timeless
past
as
they
so
often
do
when
there
is
a
change
in
outer
circumstance
so
sharp
that
landmarks
vanish
let
conscience
die
was
it
true
rodvard
thought
of
the
high
ideals
of
service
with
which
he
had
joined
the
sons
of
the
new
any
purpose
as
good
as
another
lalette
his
mind
shot
off
on
a
sudden
tangent
of
tenderness
toward
her
who
fairly
desired
to
be
a
good
partner
it
might
be
for
her
own
interest
but
still
making
two
instead
of
one
against
a
world
and
mathurin
came
in
when
he
was
told
that
baron
brunivar
was
likely
to
be
condemned
only
for
being
the
best
man
in
the
state
and
its
appointed
future
regent
his
eyes
burned
like
he
said
it
is
the
thing
we
need
the
people
will
not
bear
to
hear
it
they
will
rise
first
gain
for
your
blue
star
he
ran
out
with
his
nose
sharpened
by
excitement
his
eyes
glowing
like
those
of
a
rat
spring
festival
intrigue
of
count
cleudi
now
the
mask
mathurin
said
count
cleudi
one
corner
of
his
lip
twitched
the
black
eyes
glinting
with
malice
he
seemed
as
light
and
strong
as
one
of
those
bronze
statues
of
the
winged
man
knuckles
resting
on
the
table
his
own
costume
was
a
rich
purple
as
he
glanced
from
the
mirror
to
rodvard
s
face
masked
down
to
the
lower
cheeks
but
with
the
lips
bare
the
chin
is
much
alike
turn
around
bergelin
slowly
pivoting
on
the
ball
of
the
right
foot
he
lifted
his
own
right
arm
slightly
bent
dropped
his
left
hand
to
and
illustrated
rodvard
tried
to
follow
him
not
quite
right
with
the
dagger
you
are
jerky
but
you
will
hardly
be
dancing
a
corabando
have
the
goodness
to
walk
across
the
room
stand
mathurin
where
does
he
lack
the
resemblance
the
servant
s
fingers
came
up
to
his
lip
the
voice
is
almost
perfect
my
lord
but
there
is
something
in
the
movement
of
the
hands
not
quite
it
is
only
birth
that
does
it
said
cleudi
the
wrist
laces
he
is
not
very
used
to
handling
them
but
for
the
rest
bergelin
you
were
born
a
most
accomplished
mimic
and
swindler
remind
me
to
dismiss
you
before
your
natural
talent
is
turned
in
my
direction
now
the
instruction
i
am
to
be
at
the
ball
when
the
opera
is
over
at
least
a
glass
before
midnight
the
fourth
box
on
the
side
is
yours
i
am
to
look
at
the
doorbase
of
the
second
box
where
a
handkerchief
will
be
caught
if
it
is
white
edged
with
lace
perfumed
with
honeymusk
i
am
to
go
below
and
make
myself
seen
at
the
gaming
tables
but
if
the
handkerchief
is
blue
and
i
am
to
take
it
away
and
leave
in
its
place
another
then
without
being
seen
on
the
dancing
floor
or
at
the
games
go
at
once
to
my
lord
s
box
but
leave
the
panels
up
and
the
curtains
closed
someone
will
presently
tap
twice
a
lady
i
am
to
greet
her
with
my
lord
s
sonnet
eat
with
her
declare
my
passion
for
her
my
lord
yes
what
cleudi
shot
him
a
gleam
containing
amusement
mingled
with
a
little
dark
shade
of
cruelty
and
the
thought
of
shaming
him
with
the
full
statement
of
his
quaver
you
want
money
apprentice
swindler
you
no
my
lord
it
is
not
that
the
count
s
toe
tapped
his
expression
became
a
rictus
and
rodvard
rushed
on
with
heat
at
the
back
of
his
neck
what
if
the
intrigue
does
not
succeed
that
is
if
you
do
not
appear
in
the
rictus
became
a
bark
then
you
must
suffer
the
horrid
fate
of
being
alone
in
a
secluded
apartment
with
the
shapeliest
and
most
willing
woman
in
dossola
are
you
impotent
rodvard
half
opened
his
mouth
to
protest
in
stumbling
words
that
he
was
a
promised
man
who
thought
it
less
than
honest
to
violate
his
given
word
but
mathurin
tittered
and
the
stream
of
hate
and
fury
that
flowed
from
those
black
eyes
he
only
made
a
small
sound
cleudi
barked
again
ha
will
you
be
a
theologian
then
it
is
she
who
should
make
confession
not
the
wise
decision
of
the
church
as
i
was
discussing
but
lately
with
the
episcopal
of
zenss
the
minor
priests
will
say
otherwise
but
it
is
a
reflection
from
the
old
days
before
the
present
congress
of
episcopals
listen
peasant
is
it
not
manifestly
to
the
glory
of
god
that
men
should
seek
women
for
their
first
and
highest
pleasure
as
it
is
that
daughters
should
have
all
monetary
inheritance
is
it
not
also
manifest
that
all
would
be
under
the
rule
of
women
who
have
the
art
as
well
as
their
arts
unless
some
disability
lay
upon
them
ah
chutte
why
do
i
talk
like
a
deacon
to
a
clerk
enough
that
i
have
given
you
an
order
greater
things
than
you
think
hang
on
this
intrigue
and
you
ll
execute
it
well
or
by
the
service
i
ll
reduce
you
to
a
state
where
no
woman
will
tempt
you
again
now
take
off
that
finery
be
prompt
here
at
two
glasses
before
midnight
for
mathurin
to
dress
ii
but
where
does
this
intrigue
lead
asked
rodvard
could
not
your
blue
star
give
you
a
clue
said
mathurin
they
sat
on
a
green
bank
behind
the
hall
of
conference
tulips
waving
in
the
light
breeze
about
them
and
rodvard
carefully
tore
one
of
the
long
leaves
to
ribbons
as
he
answered
no
there
may
have
been
something
about
aggermans
in
it
but
he
was
not
thinking
of
his
central
purpose
at
all
only
about
how
it
would
be
a
nasty
joke
and
a
revenge
it
was
behind
his
lips
to
ask
what
he
should
do
lest
he
lose
the
power
of
the
blue
star
but
in
midflight
he
changed
have
you
done
toward
saving
baron
brunivar
will
there
be
a
rising
there
was
a
quick
note
of
suspicion
and
surprise
in
the
eyes
that
lifted
to
meet
his
nothing
for
now
but
to
let
remigorius
and
through
him
the
high
center
know
what
s
in
prospect
there
s
no
accusation
as
matters
stand
it
will
gain
us
nothing
merely
to
put
out
the
story
that
the
court
plots
against
him
yet
i
do
not
understand
why
he
has
failed
to
fly
when
it
s
as
clear
as
summer
light
that
florestan
means
the
worse
toward
what
i
do
not
understand
said
rodvard
is
why
the
high
center
has
failed
to
make
more
preparation
it
will
be
too
late
when
brunivar
s
been
placed
in
a
dungeon
under
guard
and
accusation
with
a
shar
of
soldiers
around
it
would
never
pass
mathurin
s
voice
trailed
off
he
contemplated
the
lawns
brow
deep
and
rodvard
could
not
see
his
thought
i
can
understand
the
high
what
would
never
pass
you
are
more
mysterious
than
the
count
friend
mathurin
with
your
hints
here
and
the
servitor
turned
on
him
eyes
of
angry
candor
rodvard
my
friend
cleudi
is
right
in
calling
you
more
of
a
moralist
than
a
churchman
is
by
what
right
do
you
question
me
so
do
you
think
i
am
of
the
high
center
yet
i
will
show
you
some
of
the
considerations
it
will
never
pass
that
the
chancellor
should
execute
brunivar
and
then
have
it
proved
that
this
fate
came
on
him
for
some
private
reason
and
now
that
you
whip
me
to
it
i
will
say
as
well
that
it
will
never
pass
that
brunivar
should
not
be
executed
while
we
cry
shame
we
need
a
general
rising
not
a
rescue
that
will
drive
many
of
us
abroad
people
will
not
leave
their
lives
to
fight
until
there
is
something
in
those
lives
that
may
not
be
conscience
again
rodvard
set
his
mouth
if
you
wish
the
reign
of
justice
for
others
it
seems
to
me
that
you
must
give
it
yourself
mathurin
and
i
see
no
justice
in
watching
a
good
man
condemned
to
death
when
he
might
be
saved
i
heard
the
baron
speak
out
in
conference
and
he
may
yet
win
something
there
but
even
fled
to
tritulacca
or
to
mayern
and
prince
pavinius
he
would
still
be
worth
more
than
with
his
throat
the
serving
man
stood
up
i
ll
not
chop
logic
against
you
only
say
beware
for
you
are
a
member
under
orders
your
own
will
or
moral
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
acts
of
the
high
center
brunivar
is
nothing
to
us
down
with
him
he
is
a
part
of
the
dead
past
which
is
all
rotten
at
the
heart
and
of
which
we
must
rid
ourselves
for
the
living
future
i
will
see
you
later
friend
iii
a
tray
had
been
left
in
his
room
as
usual
but
rodvard
hardly
ate
from
it
before
flinging
himself
down
to
lie
supine
watching
the
pattern
of
light
through
the
shutters
as
it
slowly
ticked
across
the
wall
trying
to
resolve
the
problem
that
beset
him
brunivar
with
his
noble
aspect
and
surely
his
noble
mind
free
will
and
the
love
of
humankind
the
baron
had
said
and
they
called
it
the
doctrine
of
the
apostate
prophet
yet
for
what
else
had
he
himself
joined
the
sons
of
the
new
day
what
else
had
the
baron
put
into
practice
out
there
in
his
province
of
the
west
yet
here
is
mathurin
saying
that
no
happiness
could
be
bought
by
love
of
humankind
since
certainly
no
love
of
humankind
would
let
a
high
man
go
to
shameful
death
when
it
might
be
prevented
no
perhaps
that
was
not
true
either
even
barbarians
had
sacrifices
by
which
one
gave
his
life
that
many
might
live
though
their
method
in
this
was
all
superstition
and
clearly
wrong
but
only
by
the
consent
of
the
one
rodvard
answered
himself
only
when
there
was
no
way
but
sacrifice
brunivar
had
made
no
consent
was
being
pushed
to
a
sacrifice
by
malignance
on
one
side
with
the
other
accepting
the
unwilling
gift
he
gave
yet
in
that
acceptance
was
there
not
something
base
and
selfish
he
remembered
the
curious
unformed
thought
of
treachery
he
had
surprised
in
remigorius
mind
mme
kaja
s
active
betrayal
mathurin
s
violence
and
was
glad
they
were
joined
with
him
in
one
of
the
minor
centers
of
the
sons
of
the
new
day
when
that
day
then
too
late
for
brunivar
ah
if
there
were
some
deliverance
some
warning
one
could
give
that
would
be
heeded
a
clock
somewhere
boomed
four
times
rodvard
twisted
on
the
bed
thinking
bitterly
how
little
he
could
do
even
to
save
himself
willing
in
that
moment
to
be
the
sacrificed
one
with
witchery
one
little
cold
drops
of
perspiration
gathered
down
his
front
from
neck
to
navel
at
the
perilousness
of
the
intrigue
in
which
he
was
now
embarked
for
the
night
perilous
and
yet
sweet
delight
and
danger
so
that
with
half
his
mind
he
wished
to
rise
and
run
from
this
accursed
place
come
what
might
with
the
other
half
it
was
to
stay
and
hope
that
cleudi
would
not
interrupt
the
rendezvous
in
the
box
as
he
had
said
so
that
the
loveliness
he
had
now
and
again
seen
from
far
in
the
last
seven
days
for
he
did
not
doubt
that
the
mask
to
meet
him
in
the
box
would
cover
the
countess
aiella
might
lie
in
his
arms
come
what
might
to
the
felon
of
lalette
s
witcheries
was
he
himself
one
of
those
whose
purposes
were
hideous
as
tuolén
the
butler
had
put
it
with
an
inner
desire
toward
treachery
toward
her
who
had
received
his
word
of
love
word
had
been
wrung
from
him
given
under
a
compulsion
was
the
product
of
a
deed
done
under
another
compulsion
this
too
before
a
high
court
i
will
plead
thought
rodvard
that
i
myself
the
inner
me
who
cherishes
ideals
still
in
spite
of
mathurin
or
tuolén
had
no
part
in
betrayals
and
recognized
as
he
thought
thus
that
the
union
in
the
place
of
masks
was
of
that
very
inner
me
given
forever
or
forever
minus
a
day
flee
then
where
a
marked
man
and
a
penniless
trying
to
escape
across
the
seignories
with
only
a
clerk
s
skill
which
demands
fixities
to
gain
bread
brunivar
might
perhaps
be
held
from
flying
to
safety
by
compulsions
as
tight
as
which
the
wheel
of
thought
had
turned
full
circle
and
the
realization
of
this
shattering
the
continuance
of
the
motion
rodvard
drifted
off
into
an
uneasy
doze
twitching
in
his
place
he
came
fully
awake
with
a
final
jerk
swinging
feet
to
the
floor
in
the
twilight
stood
up
made
a
light
and
not
daring
to
go
on
with
his
pecked
a
little
at
the
gelid
remains
of
his
noon
viands
while
speculating
on
cleudi
s
intrigue
but
the
count
had
so
buried
the
line
of
his
plan
that
nothing
could
be
made
of
this
either
rodvard
went
to
seek
tuolén
in
the
hope
that
he
might
have
some
light
vain
hope
the
butler
s
cabinet
was
dark
and
everyone
else
encountered
in
the
corridors
was
hurrying
hurrying
with
burdens
here
and
there
in
preparation
for
the
grand
ball
there
was
an
atmosphere
of
anticipatory
excitement
that
built
up
along
rodvard
s
until
he
stepped
forth
into
the
spring
eve
to
escape
it
out
there
the
evening
had
turned
chill
with
a
damp
breeze
off
the
eastern
sea
that
spoke
of
rain
before
sun
all
the
flowers
seemed
to
have
folded
their
wings
around
themselves
to
meet
it
and
rodvard
felt
as
though
nature
had
turned
her
back
he
longed
for
a
voice
and
as
a
girl
s
form
came
shadowy
around
a
turn
of
the
path
he
gave
her
and
asked
if
he
might
bear
her
burden
ah
no
it
is
not
needed
said
she
drawing
back
but
a
shaft
of
light
from
a
window
caught
them
both
and
there
was
mutual
recognition
she
being
the
breakfast
chambermaid
whose
name
was
damaris
oh
your
pardon
ser
she
said
it
is
most
good
of
you
and
let
him
take
her
package
which
was
in
truth
heavy
why
this
must
be
gold
or
lead
or
beef
not
flowers
as
it
should
be
on
festival
eve
he
said
and
she
trilled
a
small
laugh
before
answering
that
festival
it
might
be
for
those
badged
with
coronets
or
quills
but
for
her
class
it
was
a
night
of
and
it
is
not
gold
or
i
would
run
away
with
it
but
one
of
those
double
bottles
of
arjen
for
the
box
of
the
count
cleudi
whom
you
she
turned
her
head
and
in
the
light
which
threw
across
the
path
from
another
window
he
caught
a
glint
of
her
eyes
she
was
very
friendly
after
a
week
of
bringing
him
breakfasts
in
which
he
had
treated
her
as
courteously
as
though
she
were
high
born
will
you
have
no
festival
at
all
then
he
asked
oh
yes
tomorrow
afternoon
when
all
the
court
s
asleep
in
the
evening
when
they
wake
it
will
be
duty
they
had
reached
the
door
of
the
great
hall
within
workmen
were
attaching
flowers
to
the
bowered
dais
where
the
musicians
would
play
there
was
a
sound
of
hammering
from
somewhere
along
the
balcony
behind
the
boxes
and
tuolén
the
high
butler
was
revolving
in
the
midst
of
the
dancing
floor
pointing
where
a
should
be
draped
or
a
chair
placed
his
movement
was
that
which
cleudi
had
demonstrated
the
girl
s
face
turned
toward
rodvard
her
eyes
suddenly
said
she
wished
him
to
ask
her
something
he
could
not
quite
make
out
what
they
were
so
quickly
withdrawn
but
it
was
connected
with
the
festival
i
ll
have
no
festival
myself
unless
someone
takes
pity
on
me
he
said
that
was
it
would
and
dance
with
me
it
is
only
a
servants
ball
she
was
a
little
frightened
at
her
own
boldness
in
asking
someone
so
far
above
her
in
station
yet
he
would
accept
you
no
partner
my
friend
has
been
called
away
to
serve
in
the
army
i
have
my
ticket
already
and
it
will
only
be
three
spadas
for
somehow
he
would
get
them
it
would
be
an
afternoon
of
real
relaxation
from
complexities
you
honor
me
demoiselle
damaris
where
shall
i
meet
you
oh
i
will
wake
you
with
breakfast
as
usual
and
wait
for
you
here
is
the
the
box
was
larger
than
one
might
think
from
the
outside
and
already
heavy
with
the
perfume
of
flowers
prelude
to
the
servants
ball
under
the
colored
lanterns
swinging
from
trees
there
were
already
a
score
or
more
carriages
lining
the
side
drives
coachmasters
talked
in
groups
the
doors
of
the
hall
stood
open
a
wide
bar
of
light
silhouetting
those
who
came
on
foot
from
the
and
turning
to
a
more
vivid
green
the
tender
grass
violins
sounded
piercingly
as
rodvard
joined
the
throng
at
the
entrance
striving
to
walk
with
cleudi
s
slight
strut
he
saw
how
all
the
floor
beyond
was
covered
with
jewels
and
flashing
feet
while
nearby
the
mingled
voices
were
so
high
that
only
the
rhythm
of
the
music
was
audible
with
women
s
laughter
riding
on
all
like
a
foam
right
behind
him
a
bearded
prophet
of
mancherei
showed
the
slim
legs
of
a
girl
through
an
artfully
torn
silken
robe
and
tossed
at
him
a
which
marked
his
white
jacket
he
must
weave
his
way
to
the
foot
of
the
stairs
around
a
group
gaily
trying
with
tinsel
swords
to
attack
an
armored
capellan
pausing
to
bow
before
one
of
twenty
queens
halfway
up
the
stairs
in
the
dim
of
the
balustrade
an
archer
of
the
guard
with
his
picked
out
in
emeralds
was
kissing
a
in
flowing
blue
they
disembraced
at
his
footfalls
the
leaped
up
and
threw
her
arms
around
rodvard
s
neck
crying
snowlord
from
kjermanash
i
will
melt
you
did
i
not
tell
you
ser
archer
that
witches
are
all
fickle
but
are
tamed
by
those
who
battle
for
them
said
the
archer
as
rodvard
gave
her
the
kiss
she
sought
behind
her
eyes
was
nothing
but
reckless
pleasure
my
lord
of
kjermanash
i
challenge
you
will
you
duel
or
die
for
her
oh
fie
cried
the
no
one
shall
ever
tame
me
and
giving
them
each
a
box
on
the
ear
in
a
single
motion
ran
lightfoot
and
laughing
down
the
steps
to
throw
herself
on
the
capellan
shouting
that
he
was
her
prisoner
lost
lost
cried
the
archer
in
mock
agony
come
my
lord
let
us
make
an
alliance
for
the
conquest
of
witches
less
fickle
than
the
marine
i
will
provide
the
arm
and
you
the
purse
from
that
secret
which
all
kjermanash
ah
ser
archer
it
is
magic
gold
and
at
the
touch
of
a
witch
would
rodvard
bowed
and
turned
up
the
stairs
for
most
it
was
still
too
early
to
retire
to
the
boxes
the
corridor
behind
them
was
empty
of
all
but
one
small
group
of
masks
laughing
together
rodvard
waited
a
moment
with
beating
heart
turning
to
toss
one
of
his
snowballs
of
perfumed
fabric
at
random
into
the
crowd
below
he
thought
someone
down
there
in
the
group
might
have
cried
cleudi
as
the
people
at
the
end
of
the
corridor
entered
their
box
and
he
was
alone
the
handkerchief
was
in
place
it
was
more
than
a
little
dim
for
him
to
be
sure
of
the
color
but
as
he
took
it
from
its
place
with
a
little
tear
there
could
be
no
doubt
that
the
perfume
was
rose
eight
paces
counted
in
automatic
nervousness
carried
him
to
the
door
of
cleudi
s
box
music
and
voices
were
muted
from
within
it
was
an
island
of
alone
the
feeling
deepened
by
everything
in
view
other
servants
than
damaris
had
been
busy
the
reek
of
flowers
was
heavier
than
ever
even
the
chairs
were
garlanded
and
the
odor
enhanced
by
a
tall
candle
which
stood
on
the
sideboard
left
of
the
entrance
sending
a
tiny
curl
of
perfumed
smoke
into
the
still
air
around
the
candle
were
viands
beyond
the
sideboard
against
the
wall
a
divan
with
rolling
edges
round
chairs
facing
the
panels
where
the
box
would
look
out
over
the
dancing
floor
if
the
panels
were
let
down
and
the
curtains
drawn
back
there
were
two
chairs
facing
the
table
and
it
was
laid
but
in
the
center
only
the
bottle
of
its
cork
already
drawn
rodvard
poured
himself
a
dram
and
drank
it
rapidly
savoring
the
warm
shock
as
it
coursed
down
his
throat
he
wondered
if
he
dared
take
a
second
draft
and
decided
against
he
would
need
clear
wits
to
play
his
part
a
slice
from
the
ham
made
him
realize
hunger
but
again
he
forebore
to
go
further
it
would
be
ungentle
to
disarrange
the
meal
before
the
arrival
of
his
guest
he
walked
slowly
across
and
seated
himself
in
one
of
the
chairs
looking
outward
toward
the
blank
paneling
twisting
his
back
into
the
comfort
of
the
seat
but
without
finding
rest
from
below
the
high
note
of
a
violin
in
crescendo
pierced
the
hangings
one
might
be
one
of
those
gods
of
antique
legend
who
sit
on
the
shining
mountains
with
heads
above
the
clouds
and
control
mortal
destinies
to
whom
all
below
would
be
what
he
heard
now
a
babble
with
an
occasional
note
of
agony
ah
but
to
be
the
controller
instead
of
the
the
door
was
tapped
so
rapidly
that
the
chair
was
overset
rodvard
leaped
to
his
feet
picked
it
up
cursing
his
clumsiness
strode
swiftly
to
the
door
and
threw
it
open
on
the
threshold
stood
the
prophet
of
mancherei
who
had
teased
him
with
the
he
bowed
over
her
hand
drawing
her
in
and
as
the
door
closed
declaimed
now
that
winter
s
gone
the
earth
has
lost
her
robes
and
now
no
more
the
frost
candies
the
grass
or
casts
an
icy
cream
upon
the
silver
lake
or
crystal
stream
now
do
the
choir
of
chirping
minstrels
bring
in
triumph
to
the
world
the
youthful
spring
the
valleys
woods
and
hills
in
rich
array
welcome
the
coming
of
the
may
now
all
things
smile
only
my
love
doth
lower
nor
hath
the
scalding
sun
the
power
to
melt
that
marble
ice
which
still
doth
hold
her
heart
congealed
and
makes
her
pity
cold
how
shall
we
call
it
spring
when
she
doth
carry
june
in
her
eyes
in
her
heart
january
a
yet
joyously
with
laughing
lips
as
cleudi
might
have
done
it
passing
one
hand
around
her
shoulders
with
the
other
holding
tight
to
her
hand
a
northern
lord
to
complain
of
the
cold
and
to
instruct
the
prophet
of
love
in
love
she
said
in
countess
aiella
s
thrilling
voice
if
it
were
only
this
one
i
will
not
grant
your
right
to
sue
until
you
have
proved
love
your
ah
that
would
be
epicene
said
rodvard
the
working
in
him
but
it
was
too
dim
to
wring
truth
from
her
eyes
you
must
convert
yourself
to
a
woman
before
you
can
convert
me
to
your
sacred
oh
love
does
not
remain
true
love
when
its
longings
are
satisfied
therefore
the
sacred
which
can
never
be
satisfied
is
above
the
profane
she
said
stepping
to
one
of
the
chairs
at
the
table
with
a
graceful
play
of
ankle
her
hands
went
up
to
slip
off
the
and
she
sat
back
hair
falling
round
her
shoulders
i
am
a
little
weary
my
lord
of
kjermanash
give
me
something
to
drink
that
will
warm
your
wintry
her
fingers
toyed
with
a
goblet
but
he
took
one
of
the
from
his
belt
poured
it
full
then
as
she
drank
disengaged
it
from
her
fingers
and
finished
it
himself
lips
carefully
at
the
place
where
hers
had
touched
the
edge
not
worthy
of
you
my
lord
is
this
the
promised
originality
go
catch
with
such
alas
he
said
using
the
same
the
voice
was
the
true
love
and
longing
has
no
tricks
only
the
expression
by
every
means
of
its
desire
let
us
contest
your
heresy
that
satisfied
longing
is
the
end
of
love
for
in
love
the
momentary
assuagement
only
leads
to
further
he
poured
her
more
from
the
bottle
and
this
time
took
the
other
cup
himself
the
glint
of
her
eye
momentarily
caught
held
some
slight
anticipation
of
pleasure
but
there
was
more
in
it
of
weariness
with
the
world
ah
if
it
only
would
she
said
and
turned
her
lovely
head
aside
i
am
hungry
my
he
leaped
up
at
once
and
began
to
serve
her
from
the
sideboard
while
the
joyous
tumult
from
below
and
along
the
corridor
became
louder
and
someone
in
the
next
box
was
making
high
festival
with
squeals
of
women
laughing
and
the
rumble
of
men
they
ate
talking
a
little
more
of
the
nature
of
love
and
whether
it
lives
by
satisfaction
or
by
the
lack
of
it
she
drank
more
than
he
there
were
springcakes
he
set
one
before
her
but
she
only
tasted
it
and
pushed
it
away
whereupon
he
left
his
own
untouched
and
ran
around
the
table
to
gather
her
in
his
arms
you
are
the
only
sweet
i
need
he
whispered
feeling
at
once
strong
and
weak
but
she
avoided
her
head
from
his
kiss
and
when
he
essayed
to
hold
her
shook
herself
free
with
no
ah
let
us
not
spoil
lovely
aiella
do
not
say
that
i
implore
he
cried
slipping
down
with
one
arm
around
her
waist
his
face
close
to
the
sweet
hair
of
her
turned
head
and
now
with
the
and
nearness
it
was
not
of
maritzl
of
stojenrosek
he
thought
of
maritzl
lost
or
of
lalette
or
of
the
interruption
that
would
come
but
only
of
desire
and
he
slipped
farther
to
one
knee
not
saying
anything
any
more
only
drawing
her
hands
to
him
and
kissing
them
again
and
again
she
took
them
from
him
and
lifted
his
face
gently
to
look
him
straight
in
the
eyes
for
one
long
breath
in
which
the
sound
of
the
twittering
recorders
came
from
the
floor
beneath
then
the
countess
aiella
rose
a
trifle
unsteadily
to
her
feet
and
as
rodvard
rose
also
holding
her
in
the
circle
of
his
arms
said
shall
we
kiss
her
face
was
in
shadow
as
the
full
lips
met
his
but
as
he
swung
her
from
her
feet
toward
the
divan
her
eyes
came
open
and
he
saw
in
those
deep
pools
that
she
would
resist
no
longer
only
hope
that
it
would
be
better
than
the
others
he
half
fell
across
her
with
fingers
and
lips
they
devoured
each
the
creak
of
the
opening
door
shivered
through
every
muscle
be
careful
my
lord
said
cleudi
s
voice
strongly
by
the
service
what
s
here
rodvard
rolled
himself
afoot
the
thought
of
that
other
union
unconsummated
in
mme
kaja
s
garret
shouting
a
trumpet
through
his
mind
and
making
him
now
glad
glad
of
this
failure
and
around
to
see
cleudi
all
in
his
purple
costume
with
the
pudgy
duke
of
aggermans
and
between
the
two
a
masque
dressed
as
a
bear
the
man
was
very
drunk
as
the
lolling
white
head
came
upright
in
its
swing
rodvard
found
himself
looking
into
the
eyes
of
the
people
s
friend
baron
brunivar
and
even
in
the
dim
light
was
appalled
by
what
he
saw
there
for
the
man
was
not
only
drunk
he
had
a
witchery
upon
him
the
mouth
opened
sh
my
always
darling
said
brunivar
thickly
and
disengaging
his
arm
from
cleudi
s
swung
it
in
a
round
gesture
glad
you
foun
her
for
aggermans
released
the
other
arm
the
baron
took
three
stumbling
steps
toward
aiella
and
as
she
slipped
his
clutch
stumbled
onto
the
divan
pushed
himself
around
focussed
his
eyes
with
difficulty
and
cried
now
i
foun
her
festival
night
you
go
leave
us
and
i
do
anything
you
want
tomorrow
my
lor
aggermans
round
face
had
gone
that
i
can
credit
my
lord
he
said
looking
steadily
not
at
brunivar
but
at
the
countess
aiella
the
more
since
i
once
would
have
done
the
same
but
it
is
too
high
a
price
for
the
temporary
favors
of
a
bona
the
countess
laughed
the
pleasure
of
your
grace
s
company
has
been
so
small
that
you
must
not
blame
me
if
i
seek
she
turned
to
cleudi
with
a
certain
dignity
as
for
you
my
lord
i
know
whom
i
have
to
thank
for
this
shame
and
believe
me
i
will
not
forget
he
bowed
if
the
memory
lasts
until
the
next
time
when
you
laugh
over
having
given
a
rendezvous
you
never
meant
to
keep
i
shall
feel
myself
repaid
for
my
troubles
he
said
ah
she
has
been
deceiving
you
too
said
aggermans
and
turned
toward
rodvard
as
brunivar
made
one
more
pawing
effort
to
grasp
the
girl
and
who
is
this
i
think
i
should
like
to
remember
concentrated
venom
streamed
from
his
eyes
why
since
this
is
another
costume
of
mine
i
think
this
will
be
my
writer
said
cleudi
take
off
your
mask
rodvard
drew
it
off
slowly
not
knowing
what
to
say
but
the
countess
aiella
spared
him
the
trouble
i
see
she
said
it
was
all
planned
not
a
part
only
at
least
he
has
a
heart
and
so
the
advantage
over
any
of
she
stepped
over
to
take
the
young
man
s
arm
ser
will
you
escort
me
as
far
as
my
pavilion
cleudi
stepped
aside
to
let
them
pass
through
the
door
and
down
the
stairs
what
unmasked
already
my
lady
cried
someone
in
the
gay
crowd
round
the
door
but
she
did
not
turn
her
head
until
they
were
out
in
the
shadow
when
she
released
his
arm
with
now
from
within
the
hall
came
the
moan
of
violins
ii
he
woke
with
scaly
tongue
head
spinning
in
the
fumes
of
the
and
body
burning
with
unfulfilled
desires
to
the
clink
of
silver
on
porcelain
as
the
maid
damaris
bore
in
his
breakfast
tray
she
was
already
in
costume
a
milkmaid
and
not
badly
done
her
eyes
and
feet
were
dancing
oh
where
did
you
get
the
lovely
kjermanash
mask
she
asked
as
he
propped
himself
up
among
the
pillows
and
giving
him
the
tray
went
to
run
her
fingers
lovingly
over
the
white
silk
where
it
hung
across
the
chair
it
s
just
the
most
beautiful
thing
ever
i
ll
be
so
happy
to
be
with
you
in
count
cleudi
lent
it
to
me
what
is
it
sit
down
a
minute
on
the
chair
no
i
ll
ruffle
your
beautiful
costume
was
it
made
in
kjermanash
she
sat
facing
him
on
the
bed
as
he
moved
over
to
make
room
the
neck
of
her
milkmaid
s
dress
was
cut
low
enough
to
show
the
upper
round
of
her
breasts
with
a
little
in
between
and
the
blue
star
told
him
that
she
noticed
and
wanted
him
to
notice
that
it
was
festival
day
when
all
s
forgotten
in
the
new
spring
this
ball
i
m
afraid
i
won
t
be
able
to
go
with
you
after
rather
than
angry
her
face
was
woebegone
to
the
edge
of
tears
a
world
was
crashing
in
her
thoughts
you
don
t
want
to
be
with
people
he
reached
out
and
patted
her
hand
conciliatingly
of
course
i
do
with
you
but
damaris
you
said
it
cost
three
spadas
and
i
haven
t
hardly
any
coppers
she
perched
her
head
on
one
side
and
looked
at
him
birdlike
under
prettily
arched
brows
i
can
let
you
have
that
then
seeing
the
expression
on
his
face
you
can
give
it
back
to
me
when
you
get
it
from
your
he
did
not
really
want
to
go
at
all
headache
and
the
thought
of
his
position
with
cleudi
and
the
duke
of
aggermans
gnawed
at
him
he
could
not
think
clearly
i
don
t
mind
but
i
don
t
want
to
take
your
money
i
not
get
she
considered
looking
at
him
sharply
with
eyes
narrowing
then
i
know
you
don
t
want
to
go
with
me
because
i
m
not
your
she
tipped
suddenly
forward
one
arm
round
his
neck
and
kissed
him
hard
then
drew
her
head
back
and
with
a
long
breath
said
will
you
go
with
me
now
she
kissed
him
again
tonguewise
and
as
her
lips
clung
shifted
her
body
and
with
her
free
hand
guided
his
to
the
v
of
her
dress
her
eyes
said
she
did
not
want
him
to
stop
and
he
did
not
near
the
end
it
came
to
him
that
the
blue
star
was
dead
he
could
not
fathom
a
single
thought
in
her
mind
kazmerga
two
against
a
world
mathurin
entered
on
his
almost
soundless
feet
and
let
the
door
close
behind
him
in
the
dark
before
saying
rodvard
softly
rodvard
who
had
been
letting
his
mind
drift
along
endless
alleys
rather
than
thinking
swung
himself
up
i
will
make
a
do
not
there
is
danger
enough
and
its
point
would
so
be
sharpened
do
not
even
speak
what
is
it
the
duke
of
aggermans
his
bravoes
are
let
loose
no
time
i
only
just
now
learned
it
from
the
outside
there
was
the
soft
sighing
of
rain
i
am
to
go
at
once
make
your
way
south
to
the
center
of
sedad
mir
the
contact
is
a
named
stündert
in
the
second
dock
street
can
you
remember
change
clothes
with
me
quickly
do
not
even
take
the
door
which
is
watched
but
go
by
the
window
across
the
road
and
south
into
the
the
began
to
undress
in
the
dark
rodvard
recognized
the
sound
is
there
any
money
he
asked
the
rustling
stopped
you
to
need
money
who
have
the
blue
star
even
under
the
dark
rodvard
felt
himself
flush
did
he
dare
tell
what
had
happened
still
i
will
need
some
small
amount
i
have
even
under
his
breath
rodvard
could
catch
the
fury
in
the
other
s
tone
ah
you
deserve
to
have
your
bones
i
know
but
is
there
any
money
rodvard
fumbled
for
the
unfamiliar
the
man
snarled
but
pressed
a
few
coins
into
his
grasp
you
are
to
regard
this
as
a
loan
cleudi
sends
oh
you
did
not
tell
me
he
was
aiding
this
he
wants
you
to
go
south
to
tritulacca
and
gave
me
a
letter
for
you
to
i
will
transmit
to
the
high
it
might
be
a
girl
s
light
tap
at
the
door
go
whispered
mathurin
fiercely
the
window
swung
wide
rodvard
felt
rain
on
his
face
and
the
mud
of
the
squished
round
mathurin
s
soft
shoes
as
he
took
the
leap
down
a
light
flamed
up
in
the
room
behind
him
he
began
to
run
stumbling
up
the
terraces
with
branches
snatching
at
his
body
zigzagging
to
avoid
the
pennon
of
light
a
voice
shouted
across
the
rain
after
him
and
he
thought
mathurin
was
a
mighty
bold
fellow
to
face
the
duke
of
aggermans
assassins
back
there
he
came
against
a
hedge
there
was
another
shout
and
the
sound
of
crashing
footsteps
from
the
left
in
which
direction
the
hedge
ran
no
way
to
turn
and
he
stumbled
over
a
root
prone
to
roll
beneath
the
lip
of
the
shrubbery
thinking
concealment
might
be
a
better
resource
than
speed
so
it
was
shout
echoed
shout
with
an
accent
of
lost
footsteps
went
past
but
apparently
no
one
had
a
light
and
before
one
could
be
brought
rodvard
rolled
out
and
began
to
work
cautiously
toward
the
end
of
the
hedge
bending
double
the
bushes
turned
back
to
enclose
a
square
of
garden
but
there
was
a
locked
gate
low
enough
to
be
climbed
over
the
gravel
path
beyond
for
a
wonder
did
not
run
circular
like
most
from
which
he
deduced
that
it
must
be
the
one
leading
down
from
the
main
road
it
offered
the
only
real
clue
to
direction
for
the
lights
had
winked
out
back
there
the
villa
s
mass
and
the
trees
cut
off
the
from
the
bay
and
the
slope
was
no
help
at
all
with
everything
so
gardened
rodvard
pushed
forward
cautiously
presently
the
feel
of
ruts
under
his
feet
told
him
his
reasoning
was
sound
and
he
paused
to
consider
whether
along
the
road
or
across
it
the
second
alternative
won
if
aggermans
were
so
in
earnest
his
people
would
not
give
up
easily
and
they
would
likely
spread
along
the
road
there
was
no
hedge
at
the
opposite
side
but
a
narrow
ditch
in
which
rodvard
got
one
leg
well
wetted
to
the
knee
and
almost
fell
beyond
a
slope
pitched
upward
into
what
as
nearly
as
he
could
make
out
by
feeling
would
be
a
sapling
grove
with
low
underbrush
having
no
cloak
he
was
by
this
time
so
wet
that
it
did
not
matter
when
he
stumbled
against
small
trunks
and
the
leaves
just
bursting
above
deluged
him
with
big
drops
but
the
sensation
was
so
unpleasant
that
it
tipped
him
into
a
despairing
mood
where
his
fatigues
of
the
night
and
day
rolled
in
and
he
began
to
ask
himself
whether
all
pleasures
must
end
in
an
escape
of
some
kind
so
he
followed
the
pent
of
the
hill
blindly
not
thinking
at
all
of
where
he
was
going
but
only
of
how
he
was
trapped
by
unfairnesses
somewhere
and
that
it
could
not
be
altogether
a
matter
of
man
s
justice
which
was
the
plainder
of
the
sons
of
the
new
day
since
no
justice
of
man
s
would
hold
men
from
fiery
passion
beyond
an
easy
crest
there
was
a
dip
and
rodvard
hurt
his
knee
against
a
wall
of
piled
stone
in
the
field
beyond
he
could
sense
under
his
feet
the
stumps
of
last
year
s
corn
he
was
sick
with
weariness
and
fear
and
had
begun
to
sneeze
there
was
no
light
or
life
in
the
world
what
direction
with
no
reason
for
any
he
followed
the
line
of
the
stone
wall
for
a
little
time
and
it
brought
him
ultimately
to
a
sodden
whose
hard
surface
yielded
just
enough
to
the
persistence
of
his
fingers
so
that
he
could
get
the
upper
half
of
his
body
in
and
slide
down
into
unhappy
sleep
ii
he
woke
with
a
headache
at
the
top
of
his
spine
which
ran
around
inside
his
head
to
the
place
over
his
eyes
nose
feeling
as
though
driven
with
a
wooden
plug
mathurin
s
decent
black
clothes
were
horribly
stained
and
scratched
down
the
way
he
had
at
all
far
from
where
he
had
crossed
the
wall
now
that
one
could
see
by
the
light
of
footprints
lay
a
fingerlength
deep
into
the
soft
ground
at
once
he
was
oppressed
by
the
thought
that
only
too
easily
could
his
path
from
the
villa
be
traced
there
was
tuolén
s
witch
behind
as
well
and
fear
mounting
over
the
illness
he
climbed
to
the
wall
itself
and
tried
to
walk
along
its
top
to
hide
his
marks
after
the
rain
sky
and
air
had
become
clear
and
there
were
violets
visible
on
the
of
the
wall
not
that
they
did
him
any
joy
in
his
misery
the
stones
quickly
tore
a
hole
in
shoes
made
for
indoor
walking
so
he
had
to
jump
down
again
and
consider
right
across
his
direction
at
a
little
distance
there
jutted
out
from
the
stone
wall
a
hedge
which
lack
of
care
had
let
grow
into
a
screen
of
low
sprawling
trees
it
slanted
down
leftward
to
where
a
gap
would
mark
a
field
entrance
beyond
a
slow
trickle
of
smoke
ran
up
the
blue
to
signal
breakfast
rodvard
deciding
what
he
would
do
if
he
were
hunter
instead
of
hunted
found
more
than
good
the
argument
against
harborage
so
near
the
villa
he
climbed
over
the
wall
again
to
wipe
his
streaming
nose
with
a
burdock
leaf
whose
bitter
juice
stung
his
lips
and
perceiving
that
he
left
less
marked
traces
in
the
ground
on
that
side
stayed
the
overgrown
hedge
proved
to
line
a
track
that
in
one
direction
wound
down
toward
the
main
road
past
the
villa
beyond
that
track
was
true
forest
of
old
trunks
and
heavy
underbrush
it
was
surely
a
good
place
to
seek
concealment
but
rodvard
was
ignorant
of
how
far
it
might
run
or
what
it
led
to
and
with
illness
galloping
through
his
veins
felt
he
must
have
shelter
early
so
murmuring
half
aloud
to
himself
that
he
might
as
well
die
in
hot
blood
as
in
cold
rheum
he
turned
up
the
track
toward
the
the
building
was
more
prosperous
than
most
in
the
country
with
a
barn
outside
and
two
complete
windows
under
the
no
one
answered
his
knock
as
he
pushed
open
the
door
a
child
s
squall
was
sounding
with
irritable
monotony
from
a
on
the
right
and
a
woman
who
had
been
doing
something
at
a
table
before
the
fireplace
on
the
left
turned
to
face
him
she
was
bent
and
dirty
her
face
was
older
than
her
figure
what
do
you
want
she
demanded
a
place
to
rest
if
i
can
said
rodvard
and
perhaps
something
to
he
crossed
the
room
and
came
down
on
a
stool
by
the
fireplace
corner
the
lined
face
held
no
sympathy
as
her
eyes
swept
down
the
detail
of
his
torn
mudstained
clothes
and
lingered
for
a
tick
at
the
servant
s
badge
on
his
breast
this
is
not
an
inn
she
said
sourly
madame
i
am
unwell
i
can
he
fumbled
at
the
this
is
not
an
inn
she
repeated
then
spun
on
her
heel
took
rapid
steps
to
where
the
child
in
its
bed
still
bawled
and
administered
it
a
severe
clout
on
the
side
of
the
head
will
you
be
quiet
the
cries
sank
to
whimpers
she
came
to
stand
looking
down
at
rodvard
i
know
about
your
kind
she
said
you
re
too
lazy
to
work
so
you
run
away
from
a
good
master
down
there
at
the
villa
and
probably
rob
him
too
on
festival
day
when
he
s
drunk
and
then
expect
honest
like
us
who
have
to
labor
for
everything
we
get
to
hide
you
from
the
provosts
my
husband
and
me
we
have
to
get
up
at
dawn
and
work
all
day
as
hard
as
we
can
and
we
re
never
through
till
the
sun
goes
down
winter
or
summer
while
you
are
drinking
and
stealing
behind
your
master
s
all
this
was
delivered
in
a
torrent
as
though
it
were
a
single
sentence
ending
as
she
uplifted
one
arm
to
brandish
an
imaginary
weapon
now
you
leave
too
weary
and
ill
for
a
reply
a
trickle
he
did
not
try
to
disguise
running
from
his
nostril
rodvard
did
so
out
into
the
bright
spring
day
and
along
the
track
where
it
turned
round
a
boss
of
hill
that
thrust
in
from
the
westward
a
sense
of
being
watched
made
him
look
back
the
had
come
out
to
the
end
of
the
house
to
look
after
him
and
the
sound
of
the
child
s
petulant
wail
was
on
the
air
rodvard
felt
a
surge
of
bitter
anger
there
was
an
unfairness
in
life
every
pennyweight
of
pleasure
is
paid
with
double
its
measure
in
pain
and
only
those
who
grubbed
at
the
ground
were
entitled
to
call
themselves
honest
why
if
this
be
so
then
joy
must
be
wrong
and
god
himself
must
be
evil
in
spite
of
what
the
priests
say
but
his
head
was
too
muzzy
to
follow
any
rabbit
of
reasoning
to
its
hole
so
he
trudged
along
for
a
while
without
thinking
anything
at
all
until
he
heard
the
creak
of
a
cart
and
here
was
a
mule
coming
out
from
the
sedad
vix
direction
the
driver
somewhat
surlily
gave
him
the
time
of
the
day
rodvard
asked
to
go
with
him
and
when
the
man
said
he
was
bound
for
kazmerga
declared
that
was
his
destination
though
he
had
never
heard
of
the
place
and
possessed
not
the
least
idea
in
what
direction
it
lay
the
fellow
grunted
and
let
him
climb
in
sat
silent
for
a
while
as
rodvard
sneezed
and
drizzled
then
was
moved
to
remark
that
this
was
a
heavy
case
of
the
phlegm
but
it
could
be
cured
by
an
infusion
of
dandelion
root
with
certain
drugs
such
as
his
old
woman
made
and
so
well
that
they
often
accused
her
of
being
a
witch
the
drugs
are
costly
he
evidently
wanted
conversation
in
payment
for
his
favor
and
when
this
beginning
failed
on
rodvard
s
merely
remarking
that
he
would
pay
for
any
quantity
of
drugs
to
get
rid
of
this
rheum
fell
silent
for
a
couple
of
minutes
then
leaned
over
touched
the
servant
s
badge
and
struck
out
again
with
running
away
ey
what
happened
ey
lying
with
wrong
woman
on
festival
night
perhaps
ah
there
s
many
and
many
a
high
family
has
daughters
born
nine
months
from
festival
night
that
shouldn
t
rightly
inherit
but
lord
young
man
don
t
you
run
away
because
of
that
i
say
to
you
that
ladies
can
forgive
and
be
forgive
for
everything
they
do
that
night
when
all
s
free
and
i
say
to
you
you
ought
to
go
back
to
your
he
chuckled
and
waved
his
i
do
recall
i
do
when
i
was
a
sprout
no
older
than
yourself
how
one
night
i
went
all
the
way
to
masjon
for
spring
festival
and
at
the
dancing
in
the
square
there
i
found
a
little
cat
as
hot
as
ever
could
be
so
we
slipped
away
for
some
conversation
ey
and
when
i
got
back
to
where
i
was
staying
with
a
friend
what
do
you
think
i
found
why
in
my
bed
there
was
his
that
was
her
she
was
saying
she
had
thought
the
bed
her
own
and
no
more
clothes
on
her
than
a
fish
so
there
were
two
of
them
in
one
night
all
i
could
do
he
he
he
and
that
s
the
way
it
always
is
at
spring
festival
and
maybe
it
would
be
with
he
looked
at
rodvard
and
the
latter
was
glad
for
once
that
the
blue
star
had
gone
dumb
over
his
heart
for
there
was
a
drop
of
moisture
on
the
lip
above
the
chin
which
the
gaffer
did
not
bother
to
suck
in
or
to
wipe
away
it
was
nothing
like
that
said
he
and
to
keep
from
being
drawn
deeper
into
the
morass
of
the
old
fellow
s
thinking
have
you
heard
that
baron
brunivar
is
like
to
be
decreed
in
accusation
ey
ey
those
westerners
half
mayerns
they
are
it
will
be
a
sad
day
when
the
snow
melts
from
her
majesty
s
head
with
only
the
regents
between
that
crazy
pavinius
and
the
throne
and
no
female
heirs
ey
ey
here
we
are
in
the
marquis
of
deschera
s
seignory
for
you
it
is
no
matter
you
lay
out
the
plates
on
the
table
and
you
have
a
scuderius
in
your
hand
but
for
us
with
all
the
taxes
i
am
not
a
servant
rodvard
wanted
to
cry
but
a
clerk
who
makes
his
gain
as
hard
as
you
and
it
is
you
we
most
wish
to
but
he
forebore
saying
only
is
there
an
inn
at
kazmerga
i
need
something
to
eat
being
without
breakfast
and
a
place
to
lie
down
for
the
cure
of
my
no
the
man
stopped
and
the
expression
above
the
uncut
whisker
became
crafty
so
that
now
rodvard
longed
for
the
blue
star
would
you
pay
an
innkeeper
why
yes
i
have
a
little
you
be
letting
me
take
you
to
my
home
the
old
woman
will
arrange
your
fluxions
in
less
than
a
minute
with
her
specific
if
you
pay
for
it
and
give
all
else
you
need
for
less
than
half
what
an
innkeeper
would
ask
and
no
questions
if
the
provosts
come
nosing
ey
go
he
leaned
forward
and
rammed
the
goad
into
the
mule
s
rump
which
shook
its
ears
danced
a
little
with
the
hind
feet
and
began
to
trot
so
that
rodvard
s
aching
head
jounced
agonizingly
there
was
a
turn
the
track
was
broadening
fields
showed
pigs
rooted
contentedly
in
a
ditch
and
the
trees
gave
back
to
show
a
church
with
its
symbol
at
the
peak
and
around
it
like
the
spoke
of
a
wheel
houses
kazmerga
said
the
i
live
on
the
other
iii
she
was
fat
and
one
eye
looked
off
at
the
wrong
angle
but
rodvard
was
in
a
state
not
to
care
if
she
had
worn
on
her
brow
the
mark
of
evil
he
flopped
on
the
there
was
only
one
window
at
the
other
end
the
couple
whispered
under
it
after
which
the
housewife
set
a
pot
on
the
fire
rodvard
saw
a
big
striped
cat
that
marched
back
and
forth
back
and
forth
beside
the
and
it
gave
him
a
sense
of
nameless
unease
the
woman
paid
no
attention
only
stirring
the
pot
as
she
cast
in
an
herb
or
two
and
muttering
to
herself
curtains
came
down
his
eyes
though
not
that
precisely
neither
he
lay
in
a
kind
of
suspension
of
life
while
the
steam
of
the
pot
seemed
to
spread
toward
filling
the
room
time
hung
then
the
potion
must
be
ready
for
through
lids
rodvard
could
see
her
lurch
toward
him
in
a
manner
somewhat
odd
yet
it
was
not
till
she
reached
the
very
side
of
the
bed
and
lifted
his
head
in
the
crook
of
one
arm
while
pressing
toward
his
lips
the
small
earthen
bowl
that
a
tired
mind
realized
he
should
not
from
his
position
have
been
able
to
see
her
at
all
a
mystery
the
pendulous
face
opened
on
gapped
teeth
take
it
now
my
prettyboy
take
the
liquid
was
hot
and
very
bitter
on
the
lips
but
as
the
first
drops
touched
rodvard
s
tongue
the
cat
in
the
background
emitted
a
scream
that
cut
like
a
rusty
saw
the
woman
jerked
violently
spilling
the
stuff
so
it
scalded
him
all
down
chin
and
chest
as
she
let
go
she
swung
round
squawking
something
that
sounded
like
pozekshus
at
the
animal
rodvard
struggled
desperately
as
in
a
nightmare
unable
to
move
a
muscle
no
more
than
if
he
had
been
carved
out
of
stone
realizing
horribly
that
he
had
been
bewitched
he
wanted
to
vomit
and
could
not
the
turned
back
toward
him
with
an
expression
little
beautiful
her
grubby
hands
were
shaking
a
little
she
grumbled
under
her
breath
as
he
felt
her
detach
the
with
all
his
money
and
then
slip
off
his
shoes
the
jacket
came
next
but
as
she
undid
the
laces
at
the
top
grunting
and
puffing
her
hand
touched
the
chain
that
held
the
blue
star
and
she
jerked
out
the
jewel
in
all
his
immobility
rodvard
s
every
perception
had
become
as
painfully
sharp
as
an
edge
of
broken
ice
he
thought
she
was
going
to
have
a
fit
her
features
seemed
to
twist
and
melt
into
each
other
her
hand
came
away
from
the
stone
as
though
it
had
been
a
red
coal
oh
nonononono
she
squealed
backing
away
no
no
no
ah
you
were
right
tigrette
you
were
right
to
stop
the
cat
arched
against
her
as
though
the
small
act
had
released
some
spring
in
herself
the
woman
bustled
to
the
invisible
end
of
the
room
where
rodvard
could
hear
wood
click
on
earthenware
then
some
kind
of
a
dumb
chant
she
raised
then
became
aware
of
a
different
and
aromatic
odor
he
was
wide
awake
now
and
hardly
sick
at
all
any
more
could
see
how
the
mist
in
the
room
was
clearing
a
little
then
heard
the
door
creak
open
and
the
s
voice
saying
did
you
get
it
done
ey
not
i
you
old
fool
you
you
old
fool
rodvard
heard
the
sound
of
a
slap
call
me
old
fool
you
weren
t
so
dainty
with
the
last
one
taken
with
the
pretty
lad
are
you
now
go
do
it
or
i
ll
slice
his
throat
myself
and
never
mind
mess
what
s
one
runaway
servant
more
or
less
ey
this
is
real
money
hard
money
more
nor
you
ever
now
she
was
whimpering
i
tell
you
you
re
a
fool
he
has
a
blue
star
a
blue
star
and
his
witch
will
know
what
s
put
on
him
and
recoil
it
back
to
us
double
triple
worms
that
never
die
crawling
under
your
skin
till
you
perish
of
it
all
the
hard
money
there
is
is
not
worth
a
sound
of
steps
the
scratchy
face
looked
down
at
rodvard
he
felt
the
man
palm
the
jewel
blue
star
ey
ah
fritzess
this
is
some
piece
of
but
the
tone
was
little
sure
it
is
a
blue
star
and
nothing
else
the
second
one
i
see
they
are
wedded
with
the
great
the
man
turned
and
though
his
own
head
did
not
rodvard
could
see
how
the
expression
of
craftiness
had
come
on
back
to
him
blue
star
now
you
witch
it
for
him
wife
witch
it
for
him
so
it
will
be
no
longer
good
you
can
witch
anything
then
i
ll
take
him
away
from
the
whimper
became
a
sniffle
i
ll
witch
ah
i
ll
witch
mumble
mumble
rodvard
heard
her
tottering
shuffle
go
and
come
the
fat
face
was
over
his
again
all
filled
now
with
oily
kinks
that
held
little
beads
of
sweat
she
looked
at
him
closely
and
then
flung
over
her
shoulder
go
out
old
man
and
leave
us
there
s
something
not
healthy
for
you
to
see
and
began
plucking
at
her
garments
to
undo
them
at
the
last
moment
pausing
to
throw
an
edge
of
stinking
blanket
over
rodvard
s
face
his
heightened
senses
caught
the
stiff
rustle
of
clothes
sinking
to
the
floor
the
aromatic
smell
declared
itself
over
all
others
her
fingers
sought
his
burned
chin
beneath
the
blanket
and
applied
a
relieving
unguent
mumble
mumble
came
her
voice
and
he
understanding
not
a
word
shouted
the
cat
as
it
raced
through
the
narrow
cot
from
end
to
end
he
could
have
melted
with
relief
as
the
fingers
soothed
his
chest
but
then
his
mind
went
off
on
a
picture
of
lalette
become
old
in
the
manner
of
this
one
and
he
would
have
shuddered
if
he
could
have
stirred
the
crooning
mumble
ended
the
s
ministrations
at
the
same
time
there
was
a
silence
set
with
small
sounds
over
which
the
continued
mewling
of
the
cat
he
heard
the
woman
at
the
door
summon
her
husband
then
the
two
of
them
speaking
in
voiceless
sibilants
a
contention
going
on
which
terminated
with
the
man
s
strong
arms
around
rodvard
heaving
him
up
like
a
sack
of
meal
exterior
air
came
through
the
edge
of
the
blanket
step
step
he
was
borne
and
with
a
grunt
dumped
in
what
must
be
the
a
pause
the
blanket
was
twitched
from
his
face
and
he
was
looking
up
into
the
disparate
eyes
of
the
woman
nice
boy
nice
boy
said
her
voice
you
tell
your
witch
now
how
i
do
good
you
tell
her
i
respect
the
great
wedding
not
him
he
keeps
your
hard
she
patted
his
still
unmoving
cheek
a
touch
that
made
his
senses
creep
and
the
blue
star
was
suddenly
shockingly
cold
over
his
heart
he
could
see
beyond
any
question
that
there
was
in
the
woman
s
mind
a
great
fear
but
also
the
great
longing
kindness
of
two
joined
against
an
armèd
world
from
where
he
was
leading
the
mule
to
hitching
the
man
s
voice
came
wife
get
that
badge
we
took
from
the
last
one
the
mechanician
i
say
to
you
you
hurry
netznegon
city
a
zigraner
festival
after
he
had
gone
lalette
cried
a
little
but
the
widow
pretended
not
to
notice
busying
herself
with
sewing
on
one
of
the
festival
masks
a
task
at
which
the
girl
was
presently
helping
so
far
as
she
could
for
she
was
no
great
artist
with
the
needle
nor
wished
to
be
when
they
began
talking
again
it
was
about
the
robe
they
were
working
on
grey
silk
velvet
which
had
been
artfully
torn
here
and
there
to
a
pretense
of
raggedness
through
which
the
slashes
were
being
backed
with
lalette
passed
her
hands
across
the
lovely
fabric
longing
to
be
gay
and
courted
in
such
a
gown
though
it
left
so
much
of
the
leg
bare
that
she
would
have
felt
a
little
shame
to
wear
it
who
was
it
made
for
the
countess
aiella
of
arjen
for
the
festival
ball
at
sedad
vix
the
younger
countess
that
is
the
unmarried
one
i
designed
it
especially
for
her
the
mask
is
she
nodded
it
hung
on
one
of
the
standards
empty
of
eye
and
mouth
but
no
one
could
mistake
the
provenance
of
the
nose
and
the
cheekbones
from
which
the
full
rumpled
beard
flowed
down
why
said
lalette
it
is
prince
pavinius
when
he
was
prophet
of
mancherei
i
thought
you
and
stopped
amorosians
the
widow
domijaiek
smiled
i
am
a
follower
of
that
doctrine
though
not
yet
perfected
in
it
but
in
spite
of
what
you
have
been
told
it
is
not
one
of
gloomy
reverence
it
does
not
prohibit
joy
nor
even
keep
us
away
from
the
world
only
declares
that
the
joys
of
the
world
are
false
beside
those
that
come
to
us
when
we
learn
how
we
have
been
deceived
by
the
flesh
you
who
are
newly
married
have
the
other
kind
of
love
now
and
will
not
know
what
i
mean
but
in
the
end
you
will
come
to
see
that
kind
of
love
as
i
am
not
married
said
lalette
letting
her
needle
fall
but
doubting
that
her
feeling
toward
rodvard
were
indeed
the
love
the
poets
carolled
and
of
which
dame
domijaiek
spoke
except
in
what
we
who
have
the
art
call
the
great
i
would
as
soon
not
speak
as
to
that
said
the
widow
but
in
our
church
we
are
taught
that
to
love
a
person
is
to
love
the
world
which
is
a
deception
due
to
the
god
of
ii
rodvard
did
not
come
back
that
evening
nor
the
next
and
no
word
from
him
of
any
kind
lalette
felt
unhappy
and
listless
after
so
long
indoors
above
her
she
could
hear
from
time
to
time
mme
kaja
s
footsteps
come
and
go
and
when
the
door
was
opened
often
one
of
her
pupils
in
song
flatted
usually
and
more
frequently
than
not
off
key
the
boy
laduis
soon
held
little
more
for
her
and
in
any
case
with
the
spring
festival
now
rushing
on
so
fast
had
to
be
taken
from
his
academy
to
run
errands
for
his
mother
who
now
worked
late
every
night
the
widow
said
the
court
had
gone
down
to
sedad
vix
the
doubled
guards
at
the
city
gates
were
withdrawn
and
the
provosts
somewhat
relaxing
in
vigilance
as
to
their
search
for
the
girl
it
might
be
safe
to
leave
her
refuge
if
she
had
any
place
to
go
surely
not
to
her
mother
s
who
would
still
be
watched
by
uncle
bontembi
the
priest
if
by
no
other
and
it
seemed
to
lalette
there
was
no
friend
of
her
own
age
near
enough
to
be
trusted
now
that
all
the
world
knew
her
for
a
witch
it
was
a
box
for
the
present
one
was
able
to
pay
in
some
sort
for
food
and
shelter
by
labor
on
the
festival
costumes
but
that
would
soon
be
done
ah
rodvard
are
you
detained
or
she
wished
him
there
before
her
for
an
explanation
that
would
also
be
the
clue
to
her
new
life
and
asked
herself
why
a
partnership
of
half
an
hour
and
not
altogether
of
her
own
will
should
bind
her
for
life
hold
him
she
thought
she
could
and
though
hating
the
dependency
into
which
she
was
thrown
hating
the
bond
that
made
dependency
her
only
resort
there
was
nothing
to
do
but
go
see
remigorius
knowing
that
man
hated
her
and
through
him
try
to
find
her
lover
oh
if
i
could
ever
be
my
own
not
my
mother
s
nor
any
his
she
wished
desperately
and
though
not
a
word
of
this
was
put
into
voice
the
widow
seemed
to
know
her
whole
mind
when
lalette
said
she
thought
it
might
be
worth
going
forth
on
festival
eve
to
seek
tidings
of
course
you
will
want
the
mask
of
the
kjermanash
princess
the
one
that
laduis
calls
sunimaa
i
will
let
you
take
nothing
more
was
said
at
this
time
nor
until
the
afternoon
of
the
festival
eve
itself
with
horns
and
whistles
already
blowing
in
the
street
though
the
sun
had
not
yet
touched
the
arm
of
spring
when
the
widow
helped
her
into
the
robe
surveyed
her
all
round
and
bade
farewell
with
a
smile
which
lalette
thought
a
trifle
sad
if
all
does
not
go
as
you
would
wish
return
here
you
may
at
all
times
come
in
the
name
of
the
god
of
it
was
just
falling
twilight
when
lalette
felt
stones
under
her
feet
again
and
breathed
deep
the
fine
air
of
spring
someone
had
hung
a
pair
of
colored
lanterns
at
the
gate
of
the
street
cossao
one
of
them
with
a
broken
pane
in
its
side
through
which
the
candle
within
shed
its
beam
on
a
group
of
three
or
four
premature
revellers
gathered
round
a
bottle
they
hallooed
to
lalette
and
began
to
follow
her
along
the
boulevard
on
uneasy
legs
but
gave
it
up
when
she
saw
a
hired
carriage
come
past
empty
and
hailed
it
as
if
to
mount
when
she
did
not
after
all
enter
his
vehicle
the
swore
at
her
but
want
of
money
to
pay
left
her
without
choice
at
the
tables
had
been
set
out
and
musicians
on
a
stand
surrounded
with
flowers
and
green
branches
were
already
intoning
the
volalelle
but
only
three
or
four
couples
were
dancing
there
were
some
murmurs
of
appreciation
for
her
costume
from
those
sitting
none
called
nor
gave
her
any
sign
it
was
a
poor
district
she
knew
she
must
look
by
the
half
too
lordly
and
that
was
as
well
some
way
farther
along
a
group
all
masked
was
holding
a
procession
from
a
behind
a
and
laughingly
begged
her
to
join
but
she
pulled
loose
the
sound
of
bells
began
to
hang
over
the
gay
din
that
rose
from
the
city
and
lalette
hurried
feeling
more
than
ever
out
of
protection
and
alone
the
street
where
remigorius
had
his
shop
was
wider
than
her
memory
of
it
someone
had
affixed
an
absurd
green
paper
ribbon
to
the
neck
of
the
stuffed
lizard
over
the
door
but
all
seemed
dark
within
there
was
no
answer
when
lalette
pulled
at
the
bell
her
heart
plunged
down
into
dreadful
what
will
i
do
without
money
if
he
is
not
there
nor
anyone
not
go
back
to
that
woman
of
strange
gods
no
she
rang
again
twice
to
make
her
insistence
clear
and
as
someone
down
the
street
greeted
guests
with
a
glad
shout
of
welcome
the
door
cracked
open
and
a
voice
said
that
the
doctor
was
abroad
not
even
in
netznegon
city
but
there
was
another
medic
around
the
corner
and
two
stories
aloft
oh
said
lalette
it
is
not
for
the
curative
that
i
wished
him
i
desire
to
find
a
friend
of
his
and
door
came
fully
open
in
the
rapidly
fading
light
the
girl
found
herself
looking
at
a
young
man
whose
chin
and
slanting
eyes
betrayed
zigraner
origin
as
always
with
that
race
the
smile
was
an
effort
to
ingratiate
but
there
was
something
unpleasant
about
it
are
lalette
asterhax
demoiselle
will
you
come
in
the
doctor
has
left
me
to
keep
his
place
for
all
that
concerns
the
sons
of
the
new
day
since
matters
have
reached
such
a
crisis
with
what
has
been
discovered
at
the
conference
of
lalette
followed
him
with
dreadful
certainty
clutching
at
her
heart
that
this
was
the
key
then
of
so
much
she
had
failed
to
understand
rodvard
was
an
intimate
of
that
gang
of
murderous
conspirators
and
so
must
these
others
be
the
zigraner
indicated
a
stool
in
the
shop
and
struck
a
light
you
permit
that
i
introduce
myself
i
am
gaidu
pyax
of
rodvard
you
should
not
be
concerned
he
is
doing
good
work
and
the
high
center
has
forwarded
to
ours
its
praise
of
i
am
planets
and
centuries
away
from
the
man
who
has
chosen
me
she
thought
how
can
i
say
it
what
shall
i
ask
there
was
no
the
zigraner
frowned
the
of
your
center
doubtless
told
you
of
the
plot
against
baron
brunivar
the
regent
prospective
it
was
rodvard
who
uncovered
the
conversation
was
going
to
stop
she
cried
desperately
i
thought
he
would
be
back
with
me
for
the
and
you
have
so
lovely
a
costume
demoiselle
duty
bears
hard
on
his
smile
changed
to
a
little
bark
of
a
laugh
but
be
tranquil
for
him
he
will
sport
high
with
the
court
at
sedad
the
tongue
of
gaidu
pyax
came
out
and
made
a
circle
round
his
lips
he
glanced
where
the
clock
ticked
against
the
wall
and
darted
his
eye
around
quickly
i
will
see
you
home
or
if
you
is
you
care
to
see
how
we
zigraners
keep
festival
outside
the
dark
was
almost
full
the
bells
were
all
chiming
in
chorus
and
rodvard
at
sedad
vix
i
have
no
home
she
thought
and
he
has
sent
no
word
it
would
be
for
one
must
do
something
pyax
leaped
to
his
feet
his
mouth
all
twisted
with
joy
come
let
us
go
at
once
i
do
not
wish
to
be
late
for
the
he
ran
into
the
rear
room
with
blundering
skipping
steps
tripping
at
the
doorsill
lalette
heard
him
stumble
and
then
in
a
break
of
the
how
a
voice
in
that
rear
room
growled
at
him
heavily
remigorius
is
there
after
all
she
thought
and
maybe
rodvard
they
are
lying
to
me
pyax
voice
said
i
don
t
care
if
she
is
a
witch
she
s
going
and
was
cut
off
by
the
long
bellow
of
a
horn
blown
nearby
and
he
was
back
his
face
somewhat
abashed
he
did
not
lock
the
door
in
the
street
the
festival
was
now
with
lights
tossing
along
and
the
horns
blown
from
every
window
under
the
steady
bells
gaidu
pyax
wore
only
a
simple
and
his
voice
had
a
lilt
of
excitement
lalette
knew
it
was
because
how
all
his
family
would
boast
of
having
a
true
dossolan
girl
to
keep
festival
with
but
she
said
i
thought
you
told
me
that
doctor
remigorius
was
in
the
flickering
light
his
eyes
were
sidelong
he
is
he
truly
is
was
that
not
his
voice
i
heard
in
the
rear
room
oh
no
that
was
one
of
our
people
for
whom
the
provosts
are
searching
and
it
is
your
fault
in
a
way
because
he
had
to
eliminate
the
doorman
at
rodvard
s
house
who
recognized
how
much
further
he
would
have
carried
the
useless
lie
she
did
not
know
or
care
for
at
that
moment
a
girl
in
a
passing
group
threw
a
that
struck
him
in
the
face
iii
there
was
a
high
hall
of
entry
with
upholstered
chairs
whose
members
were
tortured
spirals
of
wood
and
a
pair
of
gigantic
silver
candlesticks
from
the
floor
rhinanthus
plants
in
form
a
respectful
doorman
came
to
take
her
furs
but
they
were
only
festival
imitations
without
weight
and
she
kept
them
pyax
said
at
our
festival
we
do
not
wear
masks
indoors
so
she
removed
her
headdress
and
drew
a
glance
of
admiration
when
he
saw
the
dark
hair
flowing
across
the
white
the
inner
door
opened
and
a
man
with
a
grave
kindly
face
came
out
somewhat
ridiculously
caparisoned
in
the
red
of
a
general
pyax
bowed
low
before
him
father
this
is
the
demoiselle
asterhax
who
has
come
to
keep
spring
festival
with
a
little
uncertain
where
the
line
of
politeness
lay
in
a
zigraner
house
she
would
have
curtsied
but
he
without
showing
whether
he
recognized
her
name
took
her
by
the
hand
with
the
friend
of
my
son
is
welcome
and
led
her
in
beyond
the
inner
door
was
a
narrow
hall
hung
with
glyptics
in
which
he
turned
rightward
through
a
second
door
and
releasing
her
clapped
both
his
hands
together
this
is
the
demoiselle
a
dozen
or
more
people
who
had
been
sitting
in
a
room
so
dim
they
were
visible
only
as
forms
stood
up
and
chorused
you
are
welcome
then
sat
down
again
with
a
rustling
of
silks
the
senior
pyax
took
lalette
s
hand
again
and
led
her
round
through
the
gloom
to
a
chair
where
he
bowed
and
placed
a
finger
on
his
lips
gaidu
pyax
took
the
next
seat
to
her
own
no
one
spoke
the
whole
place
had
the
strange
almost
musty
odor
that
forever
hangs
round
zigraners
the
sound
of
the
rejoicing
city
could
not
penetrate
lalette
felt
that
the
of
her
chair
were
carved
into
animals
heads
and
now
turned
her
attention
toward
the
center
of
the
room
where
a
single
very
weak
taper
burned
on
a
table
of
almost
height
before
a
bronze
armillary
sphere
formed
in
interlaced
tracery
a
clockwork
turned
the
sphere
its
parts
flashed
dully
in
that
breathing
silence
the
voice
of
the
elder
pyax
spoke
out
deep
and
almost
ominous
father
in
our
darkness
we
who
have
waited
long
and
long
hoped
pray
you
not
to
turn
your
face
from
the
children
of
your
creation
and
the
hope
of
your
glory
but
to
give
us
light
light
that
we
may
surround
your
throne
with
our
someone
sobbed
in
the
dim
lalette
s
caught
a
glimpse
of
gaidu
s
face
buried
in
his
hands
to
her
as
the
older
man
went
on
with
his
prayer
the
scene
that
might
have
been
moving
became
painful
and
people
playing
like
silly
children
weeping
before
a
machine
that
must
unfailingly
come
to
the
end
expected
of
there
were
true
matters
of
life
and
death
and
love
lying
unsolved
so
watching
the
dull
repeated
gleam
from
the
sphere
she
swept
into
reverie
till
sphere
and
taper
reached
the
term
of
their
movement
in
a
sharp
intake
of
breath
from
those
around
a
tiny
runnel
of
flame
slipped
across
the
base
beneath
the
device
its
heart
seemed
to
split
apart
discharging
a
bright
ball
of
purest
fire
which
threw
the
whole
room
into
color
at
once
the
people
leaped
to
their
feet
and
shouting
light
light
god
sees
us
began
embracing
and
congratulating
each
other
while
servants
hurried
in
to
light
tall
candles
lalette
found
herself
in
the
grip
of
a
woman
with
a
haired
mole
on
her
chin
whose
contours
were
laced
into
a
costume
from
one
of
the
knightly
legends
the
woman
capered
up
and
down
as
she
talked
isn
t
it
wonderful
she
cried
in
a
high
voice
we
are
so
glad
to
have
you
come
ser
pyax
never
spends
less
than
a
hundred
scudi
on
his
festival
you
are
the
one
who
witched
count
cleudi
aren
t
you
the
other
two
pyax
boys
couldn
t
come
for
the
ceremony
but
they
have
no
sisters
you
know
god
never
fails
as
the
world
turns
you
must
try
some
of
our
zigraner
a
servant
was
at
lalette
s
side
with
the
beverage
in
a
huge
silver
flagon
on
a
huge
silver
tray
and
gaidu
pyax
was
offering
her
one
of
his
paired
curiously
carved
and
so
heavy
it
must
be
pure
gold
my
aunt
zanzanna
he
said
a
dog
bit
her
when
she
was
a
baby
and
never
since
has
she
been
able
to
control
her
i
will
bite
you
and
drive
you
madder
than
i
am
replied
the
woman
with
the
mole
lalette
looked
around
over
the
top
of
her
cup
from
wine
strongly
flavored
with
resin
everybody
was
talking
at
once
and
in
all
directions
disjointedly
the
room
was
a
little
smaller
than
it
had
seemed
in
the
dark
but
still
large
with
heavy
hangings
worked
to
tapestry
at
all
the
windows
and
pictures
occupying
every
fingerspace
of
wall
between
the
chair
where
the
senior
pyax
had
sat
was
jewelled
around
its
top
at
one
end
of
the
room
musicians
were
setting
their
instruments
in
order
most
of
the
people
were
approaching
middle
age
and
were
of
a
strongly
zigraner
cast
of
countenance
but
there
was
one
girl
of
surprising
loveliness
blonde
enough
to
be
a
kjermanash
the
man
with
her
did
not
look
like
one
of
these
people
either
now
the
musicians
struck
up
and
everybody
began
dancing
even
quite
an
old
woman
in
a
corner
who
had
no
partner
but
stepped
alone
through
the
figures
the
groups
did
not
form
patterns
but
each
pair
toed
it
by
themselves
until
they
reached
the
end
of
the
measure
when
all
formed
a
circle
partners
pledging
each
other
in
their
and
crying
light
light
gaidu
pyax
danced
well
swinging
lalette
strongly
when
the
step
called
for
it
food
was
presently
brought
in
and
from
time
to
time
a
servant
would
summon
the
elder
pyax
whereupon
he
would
go
to
the
door
and
return
with
a
new
guest
on
his
arm
clapping
hands
to
make
everyone
stop
what
they
were
doing
whereupon
all
shouted
you
are
welcome
as
before
and
there
would
be
more
drinking
of
pledges
lalette
began
to
feel
quite
giddy
and
happy
no
longer
minding
that
all
these
people
seemed
to
be
talking
about
how
terribly
expensive
everything
was
or
staring
at
her
across
their
shoulders
as
though
she
were
an
actress
she
did
not
think
anyone
here
would
betray
her
to
the
provosts
the
women
all
seemed
to
be
trying
to
be
kind
the
thought
of
what
dame
leonalda
would
say
if
she
knew
her
daughter
were
in
such
a
place
struck
lalette
as
funny
and
she
sat
down
laughing
softly
to
herself
over
it
to
find
aunt
zanzanna
bending
over
her
would
you
like
to
lie
down
for
a
while
in
your
room
we
have
such
a
nice
one
for
it
was
easier
to
walk
with
the
older
woman
s
arm
around
her
the
room
was
up
two
flights
heavily
bowered
with
hangings
and
lalette
thought
she
noted
a
scent
of
musk
as
she
lay
down
on
the
rich
bed
in
all
her
clothes
the
musk
made
her
feel
sick
when
she
returned
from
the
cabinet
she
felt
so
weak
she
had
to
lie
down
again
but
the
melody
of
the
volalelle
they
were
dancing
down
there
would
not
let
her
alone
it
kept
going
round
and
round
inside
her
head
as
she
slipped
down
through
drowsing
wakefulness
to
full
dream
and
an
uneasy
sleep
it
must
have
been
nearly
day
when
she
woke
again
and
she
felt
stiff
the
scrape
of
violins
still
came
from
below
for
a
few
minutes
she
considered
returning
to
the
festival
then
slipped
off
her
clothes
and
got
into
bed
iv
she
woke
again
to
see
complete
spotted
sunlight
bright
across
the
wall
wondering
for
the
first
sleepy
seconds
where
she
was
it
was
a
footstep
that
had
roused
her
she
turned
her
head
and
saw
gaidu
pyax
looking
down
with
spots
on
his
costume
the
greeting
of
the
morning
he
said
it
is
oh
was
all
lalette
could
say
pulling
the
covers
close
around
her
neck
and
then
well
i
greet
the
smile
she
had
once
thought
rather
pleasant
became
fixed
i
have
come
to
keep
the
spring
with
he
laid
his
hand
on
the
edge
of
the
covers
you
are
my
no
not
this
time
it
is
festival
morning
you
no
what
would
rodvard
say
his
laugh
had
an
edge
of
nastiness
his
head
will
be
on
another
pillow
now
i
know
him
why
should
you
not
do
it
as
well
as
he
he
reached
down
and
began
to
paw
at
the
bedclothes
against
her
resistance
the
scream
she
tried
to
give
was
only
a
squeak
in
that
and
distant
room
and
then
he
flung
himself
on
her
catching
her
wrist
to
twist
it
around
crying
witch
witch
i
will
tame
you
or
break
all
your
she
bit
at
the
hand
that
touched
her
face
and
with
her
own
arm
swung
a
sweeping
blow
that
took
him
where
head
and
neck
join
he
was
suddenly
standing
beside
the
bed
again
and
she
was
saying
low
and
furious
through
tears
if
you
force
me
i
will
kill
myself
and
you
too
i
swear
it
by
the
gaidu
pyax
lips
pouted
out
like
a
little
boy
s
he
sank
slowly
to
one
knee
beside
the
bed
reaching
a
hand
out
gropingly
ah
i
knew
it
couldn
t
be
true
he
said
and
lifted
toward
her
a
face
of
wordless
misery
for
a
long
minute
she
looked
at
him
all
her
fierceness
and
resolution
melting
in
the
face
of
that
unhappy
desire
she
felt
no
spark
for
this
boy
only
thought
and
what
if
i
do
they
do
not
want
me
it
was
all
a
deceit
put
upon
me
and
i
can
at
least
heal
this
one
s
hurt
and
was
just
reaching
from
under
the
covers
to
draw
him
to
her
and
comfort
when
a
flash
of
lightning
wrote
in
letters
of
fire
across
the
inside
of
her
mind
the
words
you
go
with
me
now
and
though
there
was
no
meaning
in
what
they
said
she
understood
that
it
told
the
unfaithfulness
of
her
lover
the
hand
that
had
extended
to
take
that
of
pyax
patted
it
instead
i
am
sorry
she
said
perhaps
it
was
my
fault
i
should
have
told
you
when
others
do
it
i
never
could
but
i
thank
you
for
the
good
farewell
and
greeting
back
again
to
the
place
of
masks
through
streets
littered
with
the
sour
debris
of
festival
among
which
languid
sweepers
toiled
after
what
had
happened
lalette
did
not
ask
to
say
farewell
to
the
elder
pyax
or
aunt
zanzanna
there
was
a
twitch
at
the
corner
of
the
doorman
s
mouth
as
he
let
them
out
she
would
not
let
gaidu
accompany
her
farther
than
the
market
square
for
morning
had
brought
back
all
the
anxiety
of
the
price
still
on
her
apprehension
he
remarked
somewhat
spitefully
that
he
could
understand
how
she
would
not
wish
to
have
her
people
see
a
zigraner
bringing
her
home
laduis
answered
her
knock
he
seemed
truly
happy
to
see
her
the
widow
was
at
the
cookshop
lalette
changed
the
mask
of
sunimaa
for
her
worn
clothes
finishing
just
as
the
woman
returned
they
ate
talking
but
little
and
that
much
in
light
terms
dame
domijaiek
sent
the
boy
out
and
as
his
footsteps
went
down
the
stair
did
you
find
him
she
asked
he
is
at
sedad
her
mouth
worked
a
little
and
with
the
calm
eyes
fixed
upon
her
she
could
keep
it
back
no
more
he
has
been
unfaithful
to
i
do
not
in
the
we
can
not
ah
then
it
is
a
knowledge
gained
through
falsity
and
witchcraft
not
through
the
god
of
love
and
so
will
lead
to
no
good
i
am
unhappy
was
all
lalette
could
whisper
not
understanding
what
the
woman
was
trying
to
say
it
is
because
you
look
on
this
man
as
personal
to
you
love
must
share
with
there
was
something
passionately
wrong
with
this
lalette
felt
but
rue
and
the
of
last
night
s
wine
and
this
morning
s
experience
had
left
her
too
low
to
seek
out
the
flaws
she
began
to
weep
softly
after
a
few
minutes
the
widow
said
let
us
reason
if
you
owe
him
not
less
than
all
love
so
he
owes
as
much
to
you
and
by
destroying
your
joy
he
has
failed
his
obligation
do
you
still
love
him
not
as
we
must
love
all
but
to
yourself
as
of
the
material
world
it
seemed
to
lalette
as
though
there
were
something
big
and
dark
and
heavy
in
her
breast
where
her
heart
ought
to
be
and
she
had
no
clear
thoughts
at
all
any
more
i
did
i
do
not
know
he
is
all
i
you
have
a
mother
a
mother
who
tried
to
sell
me
and
still
would
if
she
could
find
because
she
wishes
to
save
you
from
distresses
she
herself
has
felt
that
also
is
done
in
love
i
then
i
ll
have
no
love
cried
lalette
looking
up
furiously
sparkling
on
her
lashes
i
ll
hate
and
hate
and
a
tiny
red
spot
appeared
on
each
of
dame
domijaiek
s
cheeks
i
do
not
think
you
had
better
say
that
again
in
this
house
she
said
i
have
an
arrangement
to
make
and
will
return
before
evening
tell
she
went
out
leaving
a
lalette
who
could
hardly
bear
herself
nor
find
anything
to
do
in
her
mind
going
over
and
over
the
dreadful
ground
of
rodvard
s
treachery
and
the
fact
that
he
was
one
of
the
sons
of
the
new
day
even
if
he
came
to
her
now
she
would
not
have
him
that
book
was
closed
by
his
own
hand
and
the
boy
laduis
coming
in
she
allowed
him
to
draw
her
out
of
her
megrims
so
that
when
the
widow
returned
they
were
almost
gay
together
but
it
was
almost
dawn
before
sleep
touched
her
ii
she
came
awake
with
a
start
and
the
sense
that
something
dreadful
had
happened
it
must
be
late
morning
the
widow
was
gone
from
the
other
side
of
the
bed
and
laduis
cot
was
empty
and
neatly
made
up
there
all
at
once
the
whirl
at
the
back
of
her
mind
resolved
itself
into
a
pattern
there
were
two
things
in
it
a
picture
of
a
strange
room
where
men
talked
before
a
fire
while
a
sea
beat
on
a
rocky
shore
and
running
through
it
as
though
the
picture
were
transparent
an
appeal
so
naked
and
desperate
that
it
brought
her
to
her
feet
at
speaking
to
mind
without
words
to
say
that
the
holder
of
her
blue
star
was
lying
bewitched
and
near
death
there
was
no
wine
it
was
horribly
hard
to
trace
out
the
pattern
of
the
in
water
even
with
the
help
of
some
dust
from
the
corner
and
the
effort
of
the
projection
left
her
so
weak
and
shaken
that
when
it
was
done
she
collapsed
across
the
bed
in
the
shift
that
had
served
her
as
a
and
did
not
even
hear
dame
domijaiek
come
in
so
you
have
done
it
said
her
voice
and
lalette
thought
that
she
had
never
in
her
life
heard
anything
so
cold
lalette
raised
her
head
the
older
woman
was
looking
at
the
patterns
which
still
moved
faintly
not
at
her
at
all
i
ask
your
pardon
she
said
it
was
an
emergency
i
nothing
you
can
say
will
change
the
fact
that
you
have
brought
witchery
into
my
lalette
struggled
to
her
feet
well
i
will
yes
said
the
i
think
you
must
go
you
have
brought
on
me
and
my
son
even
worse
dangers
than
you
dream
of
you
must
go
when
you
spoke
of
hating
yesterday
i
thought
it
might
come
to
that
but
i
foolishly
let
sympathy
overrule
my
in
the
room
above
them
mme
kaja
struck
a
chord
on
her
music
and
after
one
false
beginning
launched
into
the
bride
s
aria
from
the
lalette
looked
at
the
floor
and
there
were
tears
in
her
eyes
the
widow
spoke
again
yet
you
were
sent
to
me
for
help
and
help
you
i
will
if
you
will
take
it
i
think
there
is
only
one
chance
in
the
world
for
you
and
that
is
to
go
to
mancherei
and
place
yourself
under
the
dominion
of
the
but
i
have
no
money
to
get
there
no
money
at
all
and
what
could
i
do
there
said
lalette
now
angry
with
herself
for
having
jeopardized
herself
and
the
widow
too
in
some
manner
for
the
sake
of
false
rodvard
and
willing
in
her
contrition
to
follow
this
leading
but
not
seeing
how
it
could
be
done
love
forever
finds
a
way
to
draw
to
itself
those
who
need
it
there
is
a
fund
for
the
transportation
of
those
who
would
go
thither
and
under
the
ordinance
of
the
prophet
there
have
been
established
the
houses
called
couvertines
of
the
myonessae
where
there
is
shelter
and
gainful
employ
for
such
girls
as
yourself
who
need
do
not
believe
in
this
religion
am
a
few
believe
in
the
beginning
but
only
turn
to
our
doctrine
for
relief
from
some
condition
of
the
world
it
is
this
witchcraft
you
must
lalette
heaved
a
sigh
her
head
ached
now
and
what
was
the
use
of
this
struggle
to
be
free
and
one
s
own
the
strings
tightened
one
was
drawn
back
to
puppethood
very
well
if
you
will
tell
me
what
to
iii
the
conventicle
was
held
at
the
back
of
a
warehouse
people
sat
on
bales
of
wool
or
leaned
against
them
guards
against
the
provosts
had
been
set
at
the
door
one
who
was
addressed
as
initiate
pronounced
a
discourse
of
which
lalette
hardly
understood
a
word
it
was
so
abstract
she
could
hardly
keep
her
eyes
open
the
descent
into
doze
and
the
jerk
back
were
agonizing
a
desiccated
woman
who
breathed
through
her
nose
was
seated
on
the
next
bale
at
the
end
of
the
discourse
she
took
lalette
s
hands
in
both
her
own
with
a
gesture
astonishing
until
one
observed
that
all
the
people
in
the
gathering
were
similarly
greeting
neighbors
to
lalette
s
surprise
most
of
them
seemed
to
be
people
with
an
expression
of
almost
dogged
cheerfulness
but
there
seemed
about
them
something
lacking
as
though
they
had
bought
this
good
cheer
with
the
sacrifice
of
some
quality
the
thin
woman
was
still
talking
when
a
man
with
an
engraved
smile
touched
lalette
s
arm
and
said
that
the
initiate
would
like
to
see
her
the
man
s
face
was
calm
as
though
carved
in
stone
he
asked
her
whether
she
was
married
had
read
the
first
book
of
the
prophet
drank
fortified
alcohols
practiced
the
art
he
looked
at
her
as
though
his
glance
would
bore
straight
through
when
she
answered
the
last
honestly
that
she
had
done
so
but
would
practice
it
no
more
then
he
pronounced
a
discourse
as
incomprehensible
as
that
he
had
given
to
the
company
ending
by
saying
she
must
be
reborn
into
purest
love
at
the
close
of
this
he
told
her
that
he
had
looked
into
her
heart
and
believed
her
honest
but
that
she
must
carefully
study
the
prophet
s
first
book
he
gave
her
a
letter
for
the
of
a
vessel
even
then
at
the
wharf
the
book
he
said
would
be
furnished
to
her
aboard
by
the
third
mate
of
the
vessel
dame
domijaiek
had
been
her
guarantee
love
would
be
her
protector
she
was
kissed
on
the
forehead
and
they
all
went
out
into
a
spring
twilight
with
drizzles
of
rain
at
the
wharf
someone
was
trying
to
lead
a
protesting
horse
into
the
ship
among
stampings
and
confused
shouts
lalette
huddled
in
the
shadow
as
close
as
she
could
get
to
the
widow
domijaiek
and
regarded
the
masts
running
up
into
the
grey
with
their
climbing
triangles
of
rope
tracery
a
wide
plank
led
through
a
gap
in
the
bulwarks
before
them
but
now
the
horse
was
disposed
of
the
ship
s
people
were
engaged
in
some
bargle
at
one
end
of
the
vessel
no
one
paid
any
attention
to
the
two
women
who
tripped
to
the
deck
and
stood
uncertain
at
last
a
man
detached
himself
from
the
group
with
a
cheerful
farewell
and
came
along
the
deck
toward
them
cap
on
head
and
munching
a
piece
of
bread
he
would
have
passed
with
a
brief
stare
in
the
assembling
gloom
but
the
widow
halted
him
with
outstretched
hand
and
asked
where
was
the
overseer
of
cargo
he
halted
with
mouth
open
and
cheek
puffed
out
with
food
by
the
lazarette
and
before
either
could
put
another
question
disappeared
round
a
wooden
structure
that
rose
from
the
planking
a
few
spurts
of
rain
fell
lalette
shivered
more
snugly
into
her
cloak
wondering
whether
witch
might
not
be
written
on
her
forehead
to
make
all
shun
her
save
those
whom
others
shunned
as
amorosians
and
zigraners
now
the
chatter
broke
up
and
three
or
four
men
together
came
toward
the
head
of
the
plank
porters
mainly
with
their
iron
hooks
in
their
belts
the
exception
had
broad
but
stooped
shoulders
a
close
grey
mat
of
beard
and
an
unlighted
lantern
in
his
hand
to
him
dame
domijaiek
addressed
herself
inquiring
where
the
lazarette
might
be
he
waved
a
hand
aft
of
the
leftward
then
glanced
at
lalette
stepped
close
and
peered
at
her
so
directly
that
she
shrank
away
for
ser
brog
mother
he
said
and
turned
to
the
older
woman
looky
here
mother
i
ha
n
t
seen
you
before
along
netznegon
dock
eh
you
come
to
see
me
when
you
finish
with
ser
brog
and
maybe
we
do
business
eh
at
casaldo
the
porters
laughed
and
one
of
them
bubbled
a
derisive
sound
through
his
lips
lalette
was
already
repenting
her
undertaking
a
voice
behind
a
door
told
them
to
enter
it
belonged
to
a
tall
man
with
white
hair
whose
black
fuzzy
eyebrows
leaped
up
a
long
face
when
he
saw
that
his
visitors
were
women
he
did
not
rise
but
cast
a
glance
at
the
sheet
of
computations
on
a
leaf
let
down
from
the
wall
before
him
the
letter
he
at
first
held
far
away
as
though
it
were
an
affiction
of
proclamation
when
he
grasped
its
purport
and
had
seen
the
signature
he
rose
all
courtesy
aye
hands
must
wash
face
he
said
i
trust
you
left
ser
kimred
well
will
you
be
having
a
little
wine
dame
domijaiek
excused
herself
since
she
must
return
to
her
child
but
as
she
embraced
lalette
farewell
the
girl
felt
thrust
into
her
hand
a
little
cloth
pouch
with
coins
in
it
and
was
suddenly
at
the
edge
of
weeping
when
she
turned
ser
brog
had
set
out
a
pair
of
pewter
cups
and
was
drawing
the
cork
from
a
bottle
of
wine
he
bowed
her
to
the
single
chair
himself
taking
the
edge
of
the
bed
which
was
so
hedged
about
by
cabinets
that
he
must
bend
he
said
so
you
are
seeking
a
demoiselle
issensteg
this
was
the
name
the
letter
had
given
her
are
you
one
of
the
inland
issenstegs
from
veierelden
i
hear
there
have
been
troubles
in
that
was
he
trying
to
draw
her
into
indiscretion
and
how
much
did
he
really
know
of
her
origin
and
purpose
she
said
that
she
was
not
of
the
veierelden
branch
and
waited
he
asked
her
politely
whether
she
had
had
a
joyous
festival
and
were
a
good
sailor
when
she
said
that
she
had
not
been
at
sea
before
his
face
took
on
some
concern
and
he
regretted
that
the
captain
s
wife
who
usually
sailed
with
them
would
not
do
so
this
voyage
there
were
no
other
women
aboard
he
would
provide
her
with
a
bell
for
summoning
someone
when
not
that
you
will
be
molested
demoiselle
but
i
will
say
the
third
mate
is
as
a
dog
with
two
with
this
ser
brog
finished
his
wine
and
rose
to
light
her
to
a
duplicate
of
his
own
tiny
cabin
she
decided
she
had
been
mistaken
about
the
question
he
was
only
expressing
interest
in
the
friend
of
a
friend
it
was
nice
not
to
have
to
be
afraid
an
hour
or
so
later
as
she
sat
curled
up
on
the
bed
but
not
yet
disrobed
came
a
demonstration
of
how
well
the
amorosians
cared
for
their
own
a
knock
on
the
door
turned
into
a
porter
with
a
small
trunk
painted
with
her
assumed
name
it
held
an
assortment
of
shoes
and
a
dress
in
her
size
new
and
of
good
quality
iv
she
was
roused
by
feet
beating
in
rhythm
and
the
sound
of
distant
shouts
a
big
round
spot
of
light
swung
slowly
from
side
to
side
across
the
door
last
night
had
shown
her
a
jug
and
a
basin
beneath
the
leaf
that
formed
a
writing
table
but
the
water
was
so
cold
it
gave
her
the
new
dress
would
need
taking
in
at
the
shoulders
so
after
trying
it
she
returned
to
the
old
before
stepping
toward
the
deck
along
a
passage
that
held
three
more
doors
like
her
own
two
men
in
yokes
were
pushing
and
relaxing
on
opposite
sides
of
a
pivoted
bar
to
steer
the
ship
she
supposed
under
the
orders
of
an
officer
in
a
green
cap
one
of
the
workers
was
the
man
who
had
accosted
dame
domijaiek
the
evening
before
he
relaxed
one
hand
to
touch
his
forelock
and
had
the
grace
to
look
sheepish
the
officer
hardly
looked
at
her
he
was
watching
the
masts
that
rose
on
every
side
and
the
small
boats
about
for
they
were
well
out
into
the
bredafloss
moving
steadily
downstream
though
the
sails
hung
so
flat
it
seemed
they
could
contain
no
air
at
all
lalette
stepped
past
the
steersmen
to
watch
the
slow
pageant
of
river
moving
by
and
heard
a
step
ser
brog
he
touched
his
cap
and
invited
her
to
breakfast
down
a
flight
of
steep
stairs
and
along
another
passage
to
an
apartment
at
the
rear
of
the
ship
a
skylight
threw
dappled
gleams
across
a
table
laid
for
five
with
food
already
on
it
another
man
was
standing
by
ser
brog
presented
the
second
mate
and
as
he
did
so
a
big
officer
with
a
firm
chin
and
bags
under
his
eyes
came
in
with
an
air
of
great
hurry
and
sat
down
without
waiting
for
the
rest
this
was
the
captain
ser
mülvedo
he
bounced
half
an
inch
from
his
seat
when
his
name
was
mentioned
and
fell
to
eating
while
the
rest
were
taking
their
places
lalette
thought
his
courtesy
somewhat
strange
to
one
who
wore
a
badge
of
good
condition
and
it
was
stranger
still
when
a
youngish
officer
entered
to
be
greeted
by
the
captain
with
you
are
tardy
you
know
the
rule
of
the
ship
take
your
meal
with
the
the
young
officer
went
out
sourly
but
not
before
lalette
recognized
him
as
the
one
who
had
directed
her
toward
the
lazarette
the
meal
went
on
in
silence
when
the
captain
rose
so
did
the
others
and
ser
brog
touched
lalette
s
arm
to
take
her
to
the
deck
again
the
spring
air
was
fine
the
all
tricked
out
in
tender
green
lalette
looked
and
felt
with
a
thrill
of
delight
that
all
was
really
now
spring
for
her
she
was
free
from
the
old
life
and
everything
to
win
but
ser
brog
was
speaking
i
am
sorry
to
dream
she
said
why
dreams
do
be
what
we
grow
by
i
would
be
saying
that
you
had
brought
luck
and
fair
weather
on
our
all
but
the
one
sent
from
his
breakfast
the
laughed
our
third
mate
is
an
admirable
young
man
with
only
one
he
has
discovered
how
admirable
he
is
and
does
not
stint
his
own
the
third
mate
would
give
her
the
book
said
lalette
watching
a
tall
unpainted
barn
without
a
window
that
walked
slowly
past
along
the
shore
yet
your
captain
seemed
very
harsh
with
him
for
so
light
a
oh
that
is
only
the
rule
of
the
sea
on
a
ship
one
learns
early
that
in
this
world
there
is
no
such
thing
as
following
one
s
own
desire
it
is
all
a
pyramid
of
you
are
no
i
only
see
things
as
they
now
he
began
to
make
remarks
which
she
must
have
answered
for
he
smiled
and
continued
but
now
her
mind
had
leaped
far
away
and
she
was
wondering
whether
she
would
see
rodvard
again
ever
or
recover
her
blue
star
bound
out
to
sea
and
away
it
was
his
fault
who
had
given
her
unfaithfulness
and
desertion
in
exchange
for
the
offered
kindness
and
the
abandonment
of
her
mother
and
now
she
wondered
why
she
had
embarked
on
the
without
even
questioning
whether
she
should
she
felt
a
tear
behind
her
eye
and
hoped
he
had
come
to
know
what
resources
of
fidelity
and
good
will
he
had
lost
in
her
no
not
again
i
ll
never
let
another
have
the
making
of
my
joy
a
whistle
was
blown
men
moved
along
the
deck
of
the
ship
and
tegval
came
toward
them
with
his
cap
insouciantly
on
one
side
to
be
presented
he
had
the
same
look
of
inner
peace
as
the
amorosians
of
the
conventicle
but
mingled
with
it
an
air
of
dash
and
recklessness
the
eastern
sea
the
captain
s
story
a
frond
of
white
had
spread
across
the
sky
as
they
talked
lalette
went
to
her
room
in
the
round
that
rose
from
the
deck
and
applied
herself
to
the
needle
making
the
new
dress
right
was
a
problem
since
she
had
done
little
but
broidery
before
and
she
became
so
taken
with
fitting
and
clipping
as
not
to
note
the
tick
of
time
then
felt
drowsy
and
lay
down
to
be
roused
by
a
knock
at
the
door
it
was
tegval
third
mate
may
i
lead
you
to
supper
the
ship
had
no
motion
when
they
reached
air
here
they
were
in
the
middle
of
a
tide
with
flat
shores
stretching
to
on
either
flank
tegval
helped
her
graciously
down
the
stair
and
was
this
time
prompt
enough
so
that
all
of
them
were
waiting
when
captain
mülvedo
came
in
this
officer
was
now
at
ease
cracking
his
face
into
a
smile
for
lalette
and
trying
to
converse
with
her
about
people
a
demoiselle
of
condition
might
be
expected
to
know
some
of
them
she
did
know
but
was
forced
to
avoid
the
issue
lest
he
learn
the
falsity
of
her
name
tegval
offered
her
his
arm
after
the
meal
and
showed
her
around
the
deck
as
far
forward
as
the
his
discourse
being
of
the
parts
of
the
ship
and
the
beauty
of
the
sea
he
would
answer
little
when
she
asked
him
about
brog
the
captain
and
other
personalities
and
as
evening
was
now
beginning
to
grow
shadowy
with
a
hint
of
chill
she
announced
an
early
return
to
her
cabin
he
leaned
close
as
he
handed
her
in
the
door
and
said
in
a
low
voice
that
he
would
knock
at
the
fourth
glass
of
night
with
a
book
then
tipped
a
finger
to
his
lips
to
prevent
questions
and
she
realized
that
even
on
a
ship
trading
to
mancherei
it
was
not
too
well
to
be
an
amorosian
with
no
desire
for
sleep
she
stretched
out
on
the
bed
and
tried
to
solve
her
it
was
that
her
mind
should
turn
to
the
nearness
of
rodvard
there
had
been
about
him
the
faintest
trace
of
some
odor
like
that
of
old
leather
masculine
and
comforting
she
was
a
little
irritated
at
herself
for
feeling
the
lack
of
it
and
her
mind
drifted
off
through
other
angers
till
she
lay
there
in
the
dark
simmering
with
wordless
fury
over
many
things
the
ship
began
to
move
the
change
in
circumstance
made
her
conscient
of
what
she
was
doing
she
began
to
weep
for
her
own
troubles
the
tears
trickling
into
the
hard
pillow
where
her
face
was
buried
thinking
that
after
all
rodvard
had
perhaps
been
right
to
slip
away
from
a
witch
with
so
vile
a
temper
there
was
a
lamp
hanging
from
a
kind
of
pivoted
chandelier
she
swung
out
of
the
bed
to
light
it
but
had
to
strike
more
than
once
to
obtain
a
good
spark
by
this
time
there
was
the
queerest
feeling
in
her
stomach
as
though
it
were
turning
she
lay
down
again
not
sure
whether
this
was
the
supper
she
had
eaten
or
the
veritable
malady
of
the
sea
orderly
stampings
and
the
sound
of
shouts
drifted
through
the
cabin
s
small
window
as
her
illness
declared
itself
more
firmly
she
was
miserable
her
mind
going
round
like
a
rat
in
a
slat
trap
until
a
whistle
was
blown
four
times
and
someone
knocked
at
the
door
tegval
of
course
with
an
overjacket
on
that
swung
as
he
stood
balancing
to
the
motion
of
the
ship
on
widespread
feet
we
sail
on
a
fair
and
rising
wind
said
he
in
a
lilt
good
fortune
are
you
troubled
by
the
sea
demoiselle
i
hating
to
confess
it
no
matter
give
me
your
it
was
taken
in
both
his
in
a
manner
curiously
impersonal
the
eyes
were
closed
and
his
lips
moved
they
opened
pale
blue
you
will
be
well
said
he
and
sat
down
on
the
chair
which
for
the
first
time
she
noted
as
bolted
to
the
floor
she
did
not
believe
him
and
the
swing
of
the
lamp
made
her
dizzy
and
now
she
could
feel
his
personality
reaching
out
toward
her
with
an
effort
almost
physical
and
was
enough
ashamed
of
her
former
angers
to
put
into
her
tone
some
of
the
kindness
now
felt
toward
the
race
of
man
you
are
most
good
i
was
told
you
would
have
a
book
for
he
undid
his
lacings
and
produced
from
beneath
the
jacket
a
volume
large
flat
and
all
bound
in
blue
leather
with
the
royal
coat
of
arms
of
dossola
on
it
to
indicate
who
was
the
author
you
should
not
let
it
be
seen
he
said
our
takes
the
law
s
letter
so
seriously
that
he
would
denounce
his
best
i
am
you
may
count
on
their
fingers
touched
as
he
handed
it
to
her
no
longer
impersonal
and
she
let
the
contact
linger
for
a
brief
second
before
leafing
over
the
pages
they
were
printed
in
with
red
initials
what
a
beautiful
book
she
said
it
is
the
word
of
love
he
said
a
true
word
a
good
chopping
off
suddenly
as
though
there
were
more
it
would
be
imprudent
to
tell
i
will
read
she
did
not
want
him
to
go
quite
yet
and
sought
for
words
god
knows
i
need
some
help
in
the
tangle
of
my
said
he
we
make
a
distinction
between
the
god
of
evil
and
the
god
of
love
in
whose
arms
we
may
lie
secure
from
the
savagery
that
infests
the
world
ah
inhumanity
today
a
plover
lit
in
the
rigging
and
what
must
they
do
but
net
that
bird
to
be
eaten
by
the
captain
i
could
barely
consume
my
supper
for
thinking
of
lalette
stirred
i
do
not
understand
this
feature
of
your
doctrine
one
must
often
go
hungry
by
thinking
so
it
seems
to
me
do
we
not
all
live
by
the
death
of
other
beings
and
even
a
plant
suffer
when
it
is
devoured
tegval
stood
up
in
true
love
as
you
will
learn
all
are
parts
of
one
body
and
must
give
whatever
another
needs
for
sustenance
read
the
book
and
sleep
well
he
was
gone
and
to
lalette
s
surprise
so
was
her
illness
ii
it
was
a
strange
book
cast
in
the
form
of
a
marvellous
tale
about
a
young
man
whose
troubles
were
manifold
and
only
because
he
sought
at
each
step
to
control
his
actions
by
reason
as
he
had
been
taught
it
seemed
that
reason
forever
deceived
him
because
something
would
arise
that
was
not
comprehended
in
his
philosophy
but
was
born
from
the
natural
constitution
of
an
imperfect
world
thus
reason
always
led
him
into
doing
evil
from
which
he
would
only
be
rescued
by
rejecting
reason
for
affection
to
his
lest
the
reader
should
miss
any
part
of
the
thought
he
who
had
set
this
down
abandoned
his
romance
from
time
to
time
to
draw
a
moral
as
none
can
turn
from
vileness
to
virtue
but
those
unbound
by
the
teaching
of
the
academies
that
consistency
is
a
lalette
found
such
interjections
an
annoyance
but
forgave
many
of
them
for
the
beauty
of
the
words
which
were
like
a
music
and
the
great
glory
of
the
descriptions
of
clouds
trees
brilliant
night
and
all
the
things
that
one
person
may
share
with
all
others
but
were
polluted
said
the
author
when
the
one
would
hold
them
to
himself
yet
the
type
of
the
volume
made
it
hard
reading
the
swing
of
the
lamp
made
it
flicker
so
after
a
time
she
turned
out
the
light
and
drifted
to
sleep
by
morning
the
ship
was
leaning
through
long
surges
under
a
grey
sky
with
all
her
sails
booming
it
was
hard
to
keep
food
on
the
table
at
breakfast
captain
mülvedo
rallied
lalette
hilariously
saying
she
was
so
good
a
sailor
he
must
send
her
to
the
masthead
to
run
ropes
brog
smiled
at
her
paternally
the
first
mate
whose
ears
moved
at
the
end
of
a
long
jaw
as
he
chewed
laughed
aloud
at
the
captain
s
light
jest
and
offered
to
teach
her
to
direct
the
on
the
deck
she
felt
like
a
princess
that
this
adventure
would
succeed
after
all
glad
that
she
had
done
with
tortured
rodvard
with
her
hair
blowing
round
her
face
and
salt
spray
sweet
on
her
lips
the
waters
set
forth
an
entrancing
portrait
of
sameness
and
change
she
turned
from
the
rail
to
see
tegval
all
jaunty
with
his
eye
fixed
balancing
lightly
said
lalette
i
would
be
glad
to
know
what
witchcraft
it
was
you
used
to
cure
me
so
no
witchcraft
demoiselle
said
he
not
turning
his
head
but
the
specific
power
of
love
which
wipes
out
misery
in
joy
and
now
no
more
of
the
ship
heaved
she
would
have
lost
her
balance
but
that
he
put
out
a
hand
to
sustain
her
and
the
captain
s
voice
bellowed
tegval
i
will
thank
you
to
remember
that
an
officer
s
duty
is
to
watch
his
ship
and
not
the
pretty
ladies
you
will
do
better
in
the
forward
he
had
come
unobserved
upon
them
now
as
the
third
mate
made
a
croak
of
assent
he
touched
his
cap
to
the
girl
no
disrespect
to
you
demoiselle
you
know
the
legend
old
seamen
have
ha
ha
of
with
green
hair
that
speak
to
the
spirit
of
a
ship
and
witch
her
to
a
doom
that
is
yet
ecstasy
for
her
crew
be
careful
how
you
handle
the
people
of
my
ship
for
at
sea
i
have
the
rights
of
justice
and
can
diet
you
on
bread
and
he
shook
a
finger
and
ruffled
like
a
cock
laughing
till
all
the
loose
muscles
of
his
face
pulled
in
loops
but
my
hair
is
not
green
said
she
falling
into
the
spirit
of
his
words
for
very
joy
of
the
morning
but
thinking
with
the
back
of
her
if
he
knew
i
am
a
witch
one
can
do
nothing
for
me
why
am
i
here
there
was
a
mate
with
me
once
he
said
in
the
old
at
the
time
of
the
tritulaccan
war
which
you
are
too
young
to
remember
he
ducked
his
head
in
a
kind
of
bow
to
emphasize
the
compliment
yeh
what
a
time
of
it
we
had
in
those
days
always
dodging
from
one
port
to
another
and
afraid
we
d
be
caught
by
a
rebel
cruiser
or
one
of
those
tritulaccans
and
finish
our
years
pulling
an
oar
under
the
lash
in
the
galleys
of
an
inshore
squadron
a
dangerous
time
and
a
heavy
time
you
can
not
imagine
the
laziness
of
some
of
these
sailors
demoiselle
who
will
see
their
own
lives
sacrificed
rather
than
keep
a
sharp
watch
i
do
remember
now
how
we
were
making
into
the
green
islands
in
broad
daylight
when
i
found
one
of
them
sound
asleep
cradled
in
the
forward
where
he
had
been
set
as
a
in
the
green
islands
mind
you
where
armed
vessels
would
lie
in
among
the
branches
to
pounce
on
you
yet
you
shall
not
think
it
was
an
exciting
life
demoiselle
for
the
thing
no
one
will
ever
believe
is
that
in
war
you
go
and
go
attending
death
with
breakfast
and
nothing
ever
happening
so
that
it
is
almost
a
relief
to
fight
for
life
this
mate
was
his
name
he
was
always
called
rusty
for
no
reason
i
could
ever
plumb
since
his
head
was
not
rusty
at
all
but
dark
as
rusty
the
mate
you
could
hardly
call
him
handsome
but
he
was
gay
and
lively
and
had
a
good
tongue
always
telling
stories
he
was
of
things
that
happened
and
the
good
half
of
them
happened
to
other
people
though
he
took
the
name
of
it
but
bless
you
nobody
minded
he
could
carry
off
the
tale
so
well
i
call
to
mind
how
one
night
when
we
were
both
together
at
the
home
of
ser
lipon
that
was
our
factor
rusty
started
right
in
with
the
story
of
a
hunt
in
the
ice
beyond
kjermanash
that
i
had
no
more
than
finished
telling
him
about
the
day
before
just
as
though
he
had
been
in
the
center
of
it
i
sat
with
my
mouth
open
but
never
saying
a
word
because
it
had
not
happened
to
me
neither
and
beside
the
lipons
had
a
daughter
a
pretty
little
thing
named
belella
who
seemed
as
much
doting
on
rusty
as
he
on
her
and
it
was
no
part
of
my
game
to
spoil
him
since
i
was
spoken
for
already
y
see
so
he
told
the
story
of
the
hunt
and
soon
enough
the
two
of
them
were
off
in
an
angle
of
the
parlor
and
within
a
week
they
were
brog
approached
touching
his
cap
your
pardon
captain
he
said
there
is
a
trouble
among
those
bales
of
wool
i
can
find
but
six
marked
for
your
account
whereas
by
the
papers
it
should
be
thrice
that
mülvedo
frowned
ah
pest
i
am
he
took
lalette
s
arm
tight
under
his
own
see
me
later
they
moved
a
few
steps
away
the
captain
steadying
her
against
the
shuddering
heave
of
the
sea
that
was
his
name
now
piansky
though
why
he
should
have
been
called
rusty
i
never
could
see
they
were
married
as
i
said
after
one
of
those
lightning
courtships
we
sailors
have
to
make
because
we
have
no
time
for
any
others
and
they
went
to
live
in
a
big
house
in
candovaria
square
which
the
old
man
had
built
and
some
said
it
was
a
cruel
waste
of
money
for
just
the
two
of
them
but
i
could
never
follow
that
since
she
was
the
only
daughter
so
she
would
have
come
into
the
whole
inheritance
in
time
and
she
was
only
getting
what
would
be
hers
one
voyage
rusty
missed
while
they
were
building
their
nest
but
after
that
he
came
back
to
us
happy
as
a
rabbit
and
well
he
might
be
with
a
fine
wife
a
good
home
and
his
fortune
made
it
was
about
that
time
my
own
wife
died
rusty
took
me
home
to
be
with
him
while
the
ship
lay
over
for
a
new
cargo
dame
belella
always
had
a
great
deal
of
wine
and
a
house
full
of
people
different
ones
always
to
whom
rusty
must
forever
be
telling
some
tale
of
his
adventures
she
would
laugh
at
the
ridiculous
parts
and
look
proud
over
him
they
were
very
gay
at
least
up
to
the
time
of
the
tritulaccan
war
which
i
was
speaking
of
i
remember
going
to
rusty
s
house
after
the
second
or
third
voyage
in
that
war
and
a
dangerous
running
passage
it
was
too
out
with
wool
to
the
south
and
back
with
goods
for
the
army
but
our
captain
had
judged
where
the
tritulaccans
would
be
and
we
never
saw
a
sail
of
them
that
was
the
passage
where
we
slipped
through
the
green
islands
as
i
have
said
we
reached
rusty
s
house
late
in
the
evening
the
parlor
was
already
full
with
people
sitting
drinking
round
the
fire
and
dame
belella
stumbled
as
she
got
up
to
embrace
him
which
shows
how
much
cargo
she
had
taken
aboard
already
ha
ha
she
let
him
take
her
place
while
she
sat
down
on
his
lap
saying
we
must
be
quiet
because
here
was
ensign
glaverth
of
the
red
shar
who
had
been
on
a
raid
right
through
the
ragged
mountains
and
was
just
telling
about
it
i
did
not
think
a
thing
at
the
time
since
this
glaverth
was
sitting
on
the
floor
with
his
back
to
a
red
leather
hassock
and
besides
he
was
one
of
those
glaverths
from
ainsedel
the
family
they
call
the
mountain
glaverths
to
distinguish
them
from
the
ducal
branch
he
was
telling
how
he
had
requisitioned
a
bed
in
a
tritulaccan
farmhouse
where
there
was
a
daughter
and
made
love
to
her
so
that
she
told
him
of
an
ambush
that
had
been
set
for
the
shar
as
i
said
i
had
no
hint
that
rusty
would
take
it
ill
till
he
suddenly
interrupted
the
tale
by
throwing
his
cup
into
the
fire
and
crying
that
he
would
have
no
more
of
this
southern
red
which
he
called
hog
s
water
and
traitors
wine
but
wanted
the
honest
fiery
beverage
of
the
north
two
or
three
of
them
laughed
and
dame
belella
put
her
finger
over
his
lips
and
after
that
she
had
called
the
servitor
for
she
begged
this
glaverth
to
go
on
with
his
tale
when
he
had
done
and
they
were
all
murmuring
to
ask
him
questions
rusty
pushed
his
wife
off
his
lap
as
though
she
had
been
a
sack
of
meal
and
stood
up
next
to
the
fireplace
with
his
own
cup
in
his
hand
you
sows
of
soldiers
he
said
begging
your
grace
demoiselle
but
he
said
it
so
you
sows
of
soldiers
talk
of
your
perils
but
they
are
not
real
dangers
at
all
only
what
you
could
meet
with
on
a
city
street
and
solve
with
a
strong
arm
or
a
little
straight
talk
or
i
will
not
say
what
else
he
said
demoiselle
but
it
was
something
that
made
all
those
in
the
room
to
gasp
if
you
know
what
i
mean
and
at
least
a
third
of
them
wearing
coronet
badges
yah
rusty
said
your
tritulaccan
wenches
what
could
they
do
at
the
worst
but
slip
a
steel
splinter
in
your
back
so
that
you
go
to
heaven
with
the
church
s
blessing
for
the
glory
of
old
dossola
but
the
harridans
we
seamen
must
deal
with
could
cost
a
man
his
soul
and
eternal
agony
even
now
i
may
be
a
lost
lost
i
remember
how
he
said
it
putting
both
hands
to
his
face
with
a
sob
and
somebody
dropped
a
cup
they
all
thought
rusty
taken
with
wine
d
you
see
and
so
did
i
but
now
he
began
to
tell
a
long
tale
with
no
sign
of
winishness
at
all
in
his
voice
it
was
all
of
our
voyage
to
the
south
through
the
green
islands
and
i
swear
to
you
demoiselle
had
i
heard
it
before
i
sailed
i
would
not
have
sailed
at
all
so
gruesome
he
made
it
with
escapes
from
storm
and
tritulaccan
raiders
and
all
this
only
a
prelude
to
telling
of
a
thing
he
said
happened
in
the
green
islands
where
we
lay
becalmed
one
night
and
he
walked
the
deck
he
said
then
he
heard
a
sound
like
singing
and
the
ship
began
to
move
without
a
wind
going
forward
he
said
he
saw
something
like
pools
of
green
fire
in
the
water
therefore
knew
the
ship
was
approached
of
who
were
carrying
her
on
would
have
let
go
the
he
would
but
all
the
men
of
the
deck
watch
were
staring
over
the
side
so
little
obeying
him
that
they
even
shook
off
the
hands
he
laid
on
them
the
song
went
to
his
own
heart
and
he
knew
that
the
ship
and
all
in
it
must
soon
be
doomed
therefore
he
rusty
who
still
had
some
part
of
his
wits
conceived
the
measure
of
going
forward
to
say
they
could
have
him
as
a
willing
victim
if
they
would
release
the
rest
this
was
accepted
he
said
one
of
the
demon
women
clambered
to
the
ship
through
the
and
companioned
with
him
all
night
then
bade
him
farewell
with
the
word
that
he
must
come
to
her
again
demoiselle
i
do
tell
you
that
never
have
i
heard
rusty
give
a
tale
better
but
when
it
was
finished
the
ensign
glaverth
took
dame
belella
s
hand
to
bid
her
good
night
saying
that
he
would
bring
his
young
cousin
over
to
hear
some
more
of
rusty
s
tales
and
all
the
others
began
to
go
as
well
when
all
were
departed
dame
belella
came
to
sit
on
the
hassock
where
the
ensign
had
been
staring
into
the
fire
for
a
while
will
you
never
become
a
man
she
asked
her
husband
when
he
would
have
touched
her
he
looked
at
her
a
little
have
i
said
the
wrong
thing
he
asked
and
was
that
not
a
strange
question
to
put
the
wrong
thing
yes
she
said
looking
away
into
the
fire
without
as
much
as
turning
her
head
i
couldn
t
like
it
any
more
even
if
it
were
not
true
i
remember
that
because
i
did
not
understand
and
still
do
not
he
did
not
say
anything
more
at
that
time
but
i
noticed
that
people
were
not
coming
to
the
house
so
often
as
before
during
this
stay
of
ours
in
port
and
while
we
were
on
the
next
voyage
she
sold
the
place
and
went
out
in
the
west
to
live
so
i
think
perhaps
it
was
a
good
fortune
to
lose
my
own
wife
though
a
great
sorrow
at
the
time
because
people
do
change
and
grow
apart
instead
of
a
came
across
the
bulwarks
and
wetted
the
edge
of
lalette
s
dress
a
little
so
that
she
moved
against
the
supporting
arm
said
she
wondering
why
he
had
told
her
this
tale
but
she
must
have
known
that
he
only
made
it
up
about
the
that
could
be
could
be
now
could
be
that
she
was
angry
with
him
for
saying
so
much
to
a
coronetted
man
like
that
ensign
glaverth
but
i
think
more
like
that
just
all
of
us
want
a
new
now
and
again
and
she
could
not
bear
it
that
he
thought
of
it
before
charalkis
the
door
closes
brog
leaned
back
and
lifted
up
his
cup
as
human
people
age
he
said
the
most
important
part
of
the
body
does
gradually
move
northward
from
organ
to
organ
beginning
with
the
feet
on
which
you
will
notice
a
baby
s
attention
always
fixed
and
ending
with
old
men
who
do
nothing
but
sit
still
and
let
thoughts
go
through
their
heads
now
i
have
myself
reached
the
comfortable
age
of
the
stomach
for
which
i
give
yaw
said
the
first
mate
through
a
mouthful
of
food
ye
d
put
ser
tegval
lower
a
wee
lower
brog
looked
at
lalette
but
do
not
trouble
you
in
my
capacity
i
am
charged
with
the
duty
of
bringing
all
cargo
to
port
as
safe
as
it
a
smile
twisted
his
face
into
the
cartography
of
a
mountain
chain
and
he
swivelled
round
to
look
hard
at
blenau
tegval
the
first
mate
gulped
once
and
said
saving
always
captain
s
orders
ser
captain
has
rights
on
a
ship
at
lalette
stood
up
her
body
swaying
with
the
slow
drift
of
the
slung
lamp
overhead
and
asked
permission
to
leave
having
learned
that
it
should
be
asked
the
laugh
began
before
she
reached
the
deck
brog
s
dry
snicker
beating
time
to
the
first
mate
s
guffaw
she
had
so
little
lost
her
resentment
at
their
remarks
and
the
suggestion
that
she
was
spied
upon
that
when
tegval
tapped
on
her
door
in
the
break
of
twilight
as
usual
she
cried
through
the
wood
for
him
to
begone
but
the
horror
of
lonely
hours
took
her
before
she
had
more
than
issued
the
words
she
leaped
up
opening
the
door
and
calling
that
she
must
consult
him
he
was
to
come
in
this
was
a
mistake
too
there
immediately
arose
the
question
of
what
she
was
to
consult
on
and
after
a
blank
word
or
two
she
could
do
no
better
than
ask
what
the
prophet
s
book
meant
by
denying
reason
it
seemed
to
her
that
only
a
reasonable
person
would
read
it
at
all
ah
no
said
the
third
mate
sitting
down
and
taking
her
hand
in
his
which
she
did
not
mind
it
is
the
failure
of
human
reason
and
human
love
that
drives
us
to
the
higher
though
she
thought
this
might
be
true
in
her
own
case
and
could
even
look
forward
with
a
little
exaltation
to
the
new
life
in
mancherei
she
was
unwilling
to
break
the
talk
by
admitting
it
so
she
said
but
blenau
how
can
this
higher
love
make
up
to
us
for
sorrow
on
this
he
somewhat
unexpectedly
demanded
to
know
whether
she
believed
in
another
life
than
that
visible
and
it
was
at
her
lips
to
say
that
a
witch
could
hardly
do
otherwise
when
he
saved
her
by
hurrying
on
well
then
this
other
life
itself
must
be
love
for
us
since
we
are
its
children
and
since
this
is
so
it
will
replace
all
we
have
lost
and
more
beautifully
as
one
does
for
a
child
if
you
have
lost
a
i
think
you
must
or
you
would
not
be
for
the
is
only
that
you
may
find
a
to
lalette
it
seemed
that
this
was
hardly
more
than
half
true
and
counsel
for
a
smarting
heart
she
started
to
say
something
but
just
then
the
door
was
tapped
and
here
was
brog
with
a
smile
that
showed
all
his
teeth
ah
little
demoiselle
i
thought
to
entertain
you
from
being
alone
but
see
there
was
no
need
for
my
he
leaned
against
the
wall
babbling
at
a
great
rate
and
not
without
salt
seeming
to
take
delight
in
tegval
s
frown
which
also
filled
lalette
with
so
much
amusement
that
she
felt
herself
sparkling
at
brog
s
conceits
on
such
matters
a
fish
swim
backwards
the
young
man
grew
grimmer
and
at
last
rising
said
he
must
rest
if
he
were
to
be
a
good
officer
in
the
night
watches
brog
did
not
stay
long
after
it
was
still
early
in
the
night
she
lay
back
among
the
covers
to
consult
with
the
book
again
but
after
her
good
cheer
in
the
company
found
the
volume
mere
gloominess
and
dull
as
could
be
wondering
what
her
manner
of
life
in
mancherei
would
be
like
if
all
were
ordered
by
such
a
volume
and
feeling
the
despair
of
a
bird
bruising
its
wings
against
a
cage
of
circumstance
she
found
happiness
forever
elusive
this
escape
and
that
slid
across
her
mind
but
all
was
either
dream
or
and
as
the
rising
wind
began
to
rock
the
ship
she
fell
asleep
waking
was
blended
with
wonder
that
one
creak
among
the
many
from
the
straining
vessel
should
have
roused
her
then
she
became
fully
sentient
catching
the
reason
that
single
sound
had
come
from
her
own
door
her
lamp
had
gone
out
what
do
you
wish
she
called
on
a
rising
note
and
in
the
black
heard
three
waves
slap
the
ship
before
there
was
an
indrawn
breath
and
an
answer
not
higher
than
a
whisper
dearest
lalette
i
have
come
to
be
your
tegval
no
she
said
i
do
not
wish
he
was
close
but
you
must
to
refuse
the
gift
of
love
is
to
lose
all
you
are
of
the
oh
god
of
gods
again
she
thought
do
men
want
nothing
but
my
body
the
temptation
flashed
and
passed
to
give
him
this
and
live
within
the
confines
of
her
mind
no
i
say
i
will
cry
she
writhed
away
from
his
touch
but
he
found
her
in
the
narrow
space
the
arm
pinned
her
close
and
his
head
came
down
on
her
breast
as
he
said
thickly
but
you
must
you
must
i
am
a
diaconal
and
i
have
chosen
you
i
will
tell
them
in
his
grip
was
so
strong
that
it
paralyzed
but
he
did
not
for
the
moment
attempt
to
go
further
scream
would
she
be
heard
above
the
rocking
wind
no
she
said
no
ser
brog
will
hear
the
it
is
the
watch
to
daybreak
no
one
aboard
will
ever
no
no
i
will
not
replied
lalette
feeling
all
her
strength
melting
though
he
did
not
try
to
hold
her
hands
or
to
put
any
compulsion
upon
her
but
that
of
the
warm
close
contact
somehow
sweet
so
that
she
could
hardly
bear
it
and
anything
anything
was
better
than
this
silent
struggle
no
water
she
let
a
little
moisture
dribble
out
of
her
averted
lips
into
the
palm
of
one
hand
and
with
the
forefinger
of
the
other
traced
the
pattern
above
one
ear
in
his
hair
she
did
not
know
whether
well
or
badly
go
she
said
fierce
and
low
noting
as
though
it
were
something
in
which
she
had
no
part
how
the
green
fire
seemed
to
run
through
his
hair
and
to
be
absorbed
into
his
head
go
and
return
no
the
breathing
relaxed
the
pressure
ceased
she
heard
his
feet
shamble
toward
the
door
and
the
tiny
creak
again
before
realizing
then
leaped
like
a
bird
to
the
heaving
deck
as
she
was
too
late
even
from
the
door
of
the
cabin
she
could
see
the
faint
on
tegval
s
back
as
he
took
the
last
stumbling
steps
to
the
rail
and
over
into
a
white
curl
of
foam
a
whistle
blew
someone
cried
a
man
lost
and
lalette
was
instantly
and
horribly
seasick
ii
i
will
tell
you
plainly
demoiselle
said
captain
mülvedo
that
if
it
were
not
for
ser
brog
saying
how
he
saw
with
his
own
eyes
that
this
young
man
moved
to
the
rail
without
your
urging
i
should
have
been
most
skeptic
as
things
stand
i
must
acquit
you
of
acts
direct
as
for
others
as
employment
of
the
art
they
are
a
matter
for
a
court
of
deacons
and
since
you
are
bound
to
mancherei
you
ll
be
beyond
such
he
stared
at
her
gloomily
as
captain
of
this
ship
and
therefore
judge
in
instruction
i
must
ask
you
to
keep
your
cabin
until
we
reach
lalette
looked
at
the
moving
gullet
of
the
first
mate
as
he
stood
by
the
captain
beside
the
bed
and
even
this
sight
seemed
to
make
her
the
more
said
brog
s
voice
dry
as
a
ratchet
aye
you
have
my
word
for
it
the
little
demoiselle
never
touched
a
hand
to
him
as
he
went
over
but
he
came
from
her
no
more
rehearsing
of
things
known
we
know
all
except
what
she
will
not
tell
us
said
mülvedo
her
body
ached
all
over
from
lying
in
the
one
position
it
was
brog
again
yesterday
he
was
all
quick
with
life
maybe
a
little
hasty
but
a
kindly
helpful
young
man
and
now
the
fishes
are
tearing
pieces
of
his
guts
brog
s
face
wrinkled
in
what
might
have
been
a
smile
had
there
been
any
mirth
in
it
she
turned
her
face
away
and
began
to
retch
but
nothing
came
up
beyond
a
few
drops
of
spittle
bitter
and
sour
not
nice
to
think
on
no
said
brog
but
nicer
than
the
mind
that
would
bring
such
a
death
to
the
lad
there
s
the
real
black
stinking
the
bird
of
lalette
s
mind
felt
the
bars
shift
in
tighter
she
wanted
to
cry
and
beat
with
her
hands
said
captain
mülvedo
ser
brog
i
have
acquit
this
demoiselle
of
direct
acts
you
will
oblige
me
by
not
questioning
as
though
the
matter
were
still
to
decide
if
this
were
the
art
no
jurisdiction
lies
in
you
are
my
captain
and
i
am
therefore
even
under
your
orders
even
as
to
this
court
of
the
ship
said
brog
his
thin
lips
closing
sharply
but
i
am
master
of
the
cargo
of
which
she
forms
a
part
and
it
is
my
province
to
know
what
kind
of
goods
i
lalette
had
a
sense
without
seeing
it
directly
that
the
chandelier
swung
twice
as
she
looked
at
the
three
and
truth
but
how
to
explain
about
the
trip
what
tegval
had
done
how
he
had
demanded
the
deepest
fruit
of
love
as
a
casual
thing
like
a
cup
of
water
dragging
her
down
ah
no
she
said
in
her
dying
voice
and
swallowed
again
turning
eyes
of
misery
toward
the
captain
he
frowned
and
she
knew
it
for
a
frown
in
her
favor
and
knew
the
reason
for
it
and
hated
him
and
herself
ser
brog
he
said
i
now
declare
the
court
shut
this
demoiselle
is
not
cargo
but
a
brog
s
wrinkles
ran
deeper
the
three
passed
out
the
captain
remaining
till
latest
to
pat
her
hand
on
the
coverlet
revolt
ran
through
her
veins
at
kindness
for
the
wrong
reason
which
was
worse
than
hate
or
anger
there
was
no
understanding
in
this
seaman
who
only
wanted
to
change
now
and
again
she
was
afloat
on
a
sea
of
desires
the
daylight
swung
from
powder
to
deep
dusk
one
knocked
and
it
was
the
creature
who
stewarded
for
the
captain
who
offered
her
a
bowl
of
broth
the
motion
of
the
ship
being
a
trifle
easier
she
was
able
to
eat
a
little
and
hold
it
in
spite
of
the
shadow
that
lay
across
her
mind
but
i
will
not
regret
she
cried
inwardly
and
then
her
mind
played
critic
to
the
other
and
no
is
there
no
surcease
the
hours
slid
by
along
a
silent
stream
and
she
was
alone
iii
all
movement
ceased
sickness
dropped
from
her
like
a
veil
and
from
beneath
burst
such
a
joy
of
spirit
as
lalette
had
rarely
known
so
that
she
could
have
sung
herself
a
song
as
she
almost
leaped
from
her
place
to
put
on
the
new
dress
there
was
no
mirror
and
she
had
to
feel
the
strands
of
her
hair
into
the
demoiselle
s
knot
hoping
the
result
would
not
look
too
recklessly
wild
outside
the
deckhouse
shouts
and
confused
orderly
trampings
were
toward
but
no
one
came
to
call
for
her
until
long
after
she
had
packed
everything
into
the
small
trunk
with
the
book
tegval
had
given
her
at
the
bottom
the
door
was
tapped
brog
followed
by
a
man
with
a
red
peaked
hat
and
a
fur
of
sidewhisker
who
held
an
in
his
hand
this
is
the
demoiselle
issensteg
said
brog
and
lalette
reflected
incontinently
that
it
was
hard
to
distinguish
an
appearance
of
melancholy
in
a
face
from
one
of
dissipation
i
transmit
her
to
you
she
is
recommended
from
ser
kimred
the
residentialist
at
he
handed
the
man
in
the
hat
a
folded
letter
it
is
my
duty
to
warn
you
that
in
this
ship
she
has
been
confined
on
suspicion
of
through
witchery
in
the
home
country
i
would
have
brought
her
before
a
court
of
the
dunnier
bowed
as
unsmiling
as
brog
himself
then
with
his
as
a
wand
touched
lalette
on
the
arm
and
her
little
trunk
this
is
not
dossola
but
mancherei
he
said
subject
to
the
regulations
of
the
realm
of
mancherei
and
the
association
of
the
myonessae
we
accept
her
charge
and
her
then
turning
to
lalette
in
the
name
of
the
god
of
love
come
with
knowing
barely
the
name
of
these
myonessae
unwilling
to
ask
more
lest
she
somehow
tip
over
the
bridge
of
safety
lalette
only
smiled
and
turned
to
the
door
a
led
to
the
dock
the
sun
shone
yellowly
upon
a
row
of
wharfside
houses
whose
brick
looked
as
though
streaked
with
wet
while
at
many
windows
there
was
bunting
as
though
for
a
festival
but
much
of
it
faded
miscolored
or
torn
as
she
watched
she
brushed
against
a
hand
which
had
been
held
out
to
her
and
was
beginning
to
fall
in
disappointment
captain
mülvedo
i
am
sorry
she
said
and
took
the
hand
farewell
demoiselle
i
do
not
believe
it
if
you
are
not
accepted
here
he
seemed
at
the
edge
of
tears
a
droll
thing
thank
you
i
will
remember
your
brog
was
in
the
rear
looking
right
past
her
and
she
had
the
dreadful
feeling
that
when
she
was
gone
he
would
have
no
trouble
in
bringing
the
captain
to
his
own
point
of
view
on
her
this
was
goodbye
to
all
she
mounted
the
plank
for
the
shore
there
was
a
great
press
of
people
about
the
men
in
loose
pantaloons
hanging
over
their
shoes
and
all
walking
about
and
yammering
as
fast
as
they
could
they
seemed
reasonlessly
excited
as
though
this
were
a
day
of
crisis
lalette
could
hardly
make
out
a
sign
of
that
calm
assurance
that
seemed
to
be
the
mark
of
the
amorosians
in
her
own
country
they
stared
at
lalette
the
more
when
two
of
the
guards
who
waited
at
the
plank
with
short
bills
in
their
hands
and
the
small
city
arbalests
strapped
to
their
backs
placed
themselves
on
either
side
of
her
at
a
word
from
the
dunnier
leading
across
to
a
building
with
a
low
door
over
which
was
a
shield
painted
thickly
with
something
that
might
be
a
pair
of
clasped
hands
on
a
field
of
blue
there
was
a
door
down
the
hallway
rightward
with
a
little
man
at
a
desk
behind
it
writing
laboriously
his
tongue
in
his
cheek
as
the
light
struck
over
his
shoulder
the
guards
led
lalette
in
he
jumped
up
and
threw
down
his
quill
so
rapidly
that
a
blot
was
left
on
the
paper
she
noticed
on
his
jacket
you
must
not
interrupt
really
you
must
not
interrupt
me
unannounced
he
said
you
are
not
authorized
i
am
a
his
big
with
blue
white
seemed
to
swell
as
they
fell
on
lalette
one
of
the
guards
laid
a
paper
before
him
saying
a
candidate
for
the
myonessae
on
the
incoming
ship
from
dossola
orders
of
the
ah
the
protostylarion
was
no
taller
than
she
herself
as
he
came
fussing
importantly
around
the
desk
to
move
a
chair
two
fingerlengths
for
her
convenience
then
diddled
back
to
his
place
the
paper
made
him
frown
ah
ah
suspicion
of
the
art
this
does
not
happen
often
these
days
but
you
are
very
fortunate
to
be
here
demoiselle
instead
of
in
dossola
have
read
the
first
book
of
our
great
leader
and
prophet
answer
me
now
the
misfortune
of
the
loss
of
patrimony
why
do
you
think
that
came
upon
him
not
quite
sure
whether
he
meant
the
character
in
the
book
or
the
prophet
s
own
ejection
from
the
heirship
of
dossola
lalette
said
hesitantly
why
sir
suppose
it
would
be
because
he
tried
so
arrogantly
to
increase
admirable
admirable
whereas
if
he
had
given
of
it
freely
to
the
old
aunt
it
had
been
returned
to
him
in
high
measure
from
which
we
learn
demoiselle
the
jargon
was
distasteful
but
that
we
must
lovingly
give
all
we
have
said
lalette
remembering
the
protostylarion
bounced
up
and
down
behind
his
desk
as
he
went
on
prompting
her
replies
in
his
eagerness
so
that
it
hardly
mattered
how
little
she
had
read
of
the
famous
first
book
a
porter
came
blundering
into
the
midst
of
the
colloquy
with
her
trunk
on
a
hook
over
his
shoulder
this
placed
a
period
to
the
examination
for
now
the
protostylarion
fussed
with
his
hands
said
ah
ah
two
or
three
times
more
then
to
the
guards
you
are
as
the
pair
filed
out
he
drew
from
his
desk
a
large
ledger
and
a
sheet
of
paper
pointed
his
quill
and
said
all
in
one
breath
then
more
judicially
your
name
should
she
say
issensteg
ah
you
made
an
evasion
the
god
of
love
demands
all
truth
from
those
who
come
to
she
felt
a
heat
at
this
nagging
asterhax
i
have
given
you
nothing
but
truth
if
you
doubt
it
i
will
return
to
the
ship
that
brought
oh
no
oh
no
my
dear
demoiselle
you
must
not
mistake
all
pasts
are
buried
in
the
world
of
well
i
have
done
and
they
will
welcome
you
i
am
sure
my
dear
demoiselle
oh
the
perfect
his
pen
went
scratch
scratch
skipping
from
ledger
to
paper
the
head
cocked
on
one
side
as
he
surveyed
the
result
from
one
angle
then
another
as
an
artist
might
look
at
a
drawing
and
his
smile
approved
a
fly
buzzed
in
the
room
so
demoiselle
lalette
you
are
now
registered
of
the
honorable
estate
of
the
myonessae
in
the
service
of
the
god
of
he
trotted
around
the
desk
to
hand
her
the
paper
with
a
red
seal
on
it
rest
here
rest
here
i
will
seek
a
porter
to
lead
you
to
the
what
would
he
say
if
he
knew
i
am
a
murderess
she
thought
and
followed
this
with
a
flash
of
anger
at
tegval
for
having
made
her
one
the
protostylarion
came
back
with
a
porter
who
grinned
at
her
fine
new
dress
and
picked
up
the
trunk
farewell
farewell
said
the
little
man
waving
from
where
he
sat
you
will
hardly
need
a
carriage
it
is
not
he
was
writing
again
as
lalette
followed
the
porter
through
the
door
a
little
recovered
from
her
chagrins
she
turned
eyes
about
the
street
to
see
what
this
strange
law
of
the
prophet
had
made
of
the
country
that
was
to
be
her
new
home
the
streets
seemed
wider
than
those
in
most
of
the
cities
of
the
ancient
motherland
but
the
new
life
would
have
little
to
do
with
that
nor
with
the
height
of
the
buildings
which
mostly
gave
red
brick
for
netznegon
s
gloomy
dark
stone
the
were
full
of
goods
lalette
could
hardly
pause
to
inspect
but
from
the
distance
they
had
an
air
of
meretriciousness
and
false
luxury
all
the
people
seemed
to
be
in
a
great
hurry
lalette
began
to
wonder
what
they
would
do
if
she
put
a
small
witchery
on
one
of
these
urgent
passengers
to
make
him
stand
like
a
shuddered
away
from
the
thought
the
porter
turned
a
corner
and
they
were
at
the
gate
of
what
had
evidently
been
at
one
time
a
very
handsome
villa
set
back
deeply
from
the
street
with
a
low
wall
in
front
of
it
one
of
the
trees
in
the
foreyard
was
dead
and
another
so
yellow
among
the
leaves
that
it
must
soon
go
as
well
there
was
no
the
porter
pushed
his
way
in
and
led
up
to
the
tall
oaken
double
door
which
showed
scars
where
an
earlier
knocker
had
been
taken
off
and
replaced
by
one
in
the
form
of
a
sun
with
spreading
rays
he
knocked
after
a
long
minute
an
old
woman
opened
on
a
darkish
hall
with
a
pronounced
odor
of
javelle
and
asked
what
was
wanted
i
am
registered
of
the
myonessae
said
lalette
extending
her
paper
you
must
give
it
to
the
mattern
said
the
beldame
set
the
box
two
obulas
said
the
porter
and
as
lalette
produced
her
purse
shot
a
swift
suspicious
glance
at
the
old
woman
no
not
in
dossolan
money
do
you
want
me
to
be
thrown
into
a
dungeon
lalette
flushed
it
is
all
i
have
i
only
arrived
from
there
today
can
someone
change
it
for
me
she
appealed
to
the
woman
who
had
admitted
her
certainly
not
it
is
contrary
to
the
the
porter
rather
surprisingly
lost
his
temper
why
you
cheap
whore
you
cheat
you
he
shouted
i
should
have
known
better
than
to
carry
for
one
of
you
he
stamped
his
foot
i
d
take
your
dirty
box
and
throw
it
in
the
street
if
i
didn
t
know
the
smell
would
kill
half
the
people
in
town
when
it
burst
a
door
opened
on
a
sound
of
feminine
background
voices
there
appeared
a
woman
in
black
with
hair
piled
severely
close
to
her
head
what
is
this
mircella
she
asked
demoiselle
is
new
she
came
without
two
obulas
to
pay
her
the
dark
woman
reached
to
the
purse
at
her
belt
drew
forth
coins
and
placed
them
in
the
porter
s
hand
here
you
are
never
to
appear
at
this
couvertine
she
turned
to
lalette
you
may
come
in
and
show
me
your
paper
it
is
evident
that
you
are
in
need
of
as
they
passed
into
the
side
room
light
fell
on
the
woman
s
face
and
lalette
saw
that
although
it
was
both
strong
and
stern
it
bore
the
same
expression
of
distant
peace
she
had
seen
in
the
widow
domijaiek
the
eastern
sea
systole
the
queasiness
had
gone
from
rodvard
s
stomach
and
the
illness
from
his
head
but
all
his
senses
were
more
alive
than
jets
of
flame
every
rut
gave
him
agony
in
the
jolting
he
could
not
draw
away
from
pain
long
enough
for
anger
or
fear
yet
shortly
the
very
keenness
of
his
hurt
anaesthetized
all
down
to
no
more
than
an
aching
tooth
and
now
the
senses
oversharpened
by
witchery
began
to
report
the
world
around
him
they
were
passing
two
people
afoot
then
another
cart
to
none
of
which
the
driver
made
salutation
they
must
be
out
of
the
village
for
right
overhead
branches
began
to
go
past
against
a
sky
where
horses
tails
slid
across
tender
blue
a
bird
lit
on
one
of
the
branches
and
tipped
its
head
to
look
down
it
seemed
to
rodvard
as
he
gazed
into
the
single
revealed
eye
that
he
could
with
his
blue
star
read
the
avian
food
and
sex
confused
and
not
unlike
a
human
s
this
might
only
be
another
effect
of
the
witchery
but
it
set
him
thinking
about
his
own
confusion
of
mind
and
what
the
butler
tuolén
had
said
about
and
their
women
so
he
considered
what
species
of
joy
or
completeness
was
to
be
had
from
these
skirted
creatures
who
for
a
spiritless
complaisance
would
exact
a
slave
s
devotion
lalette
he
wondered
whether
her
witchcraft
would
give
her
knowledge
of
his
infidelity
of
thought
with
the
countess
aiella
and
of
deed
with
the
maid
damaris
and
if
so
what
penalty
would
be
demanded
of
him
ah
no
why
should
penalty
be
due
this
was
not
marriage
he
had
taken
no
oath
nor
meant
any
give
back
the
blue
star
let
us
pronounce
a
bill
of
farewell
and
be
damned
to
mathurin
and
his
menaces
or
even
to
remigorius
and
the
cause
for
which
all
was
done
the
mule
s
feet
klopped
on
a
bridge
the
clouds
were
thickening
toward
grey
above
and
birds
chirping
as
they
will
when
a
storm
is
toward
no
no
friend
rodvard
he
answered
himself
be
honorable
as
you
hope
to
receive
honor
acquiescence
she
gave
you
aye
beneath
the
trees
but
you
half
forced
her
then
the
night
in
the
widow
domijaiek
s
bed
was
no
unwilling
gift
but
for
both
of
them
the
end
of
life
and
its
beginning
a
new
life
with
lalette
the
witch
holding
the
sweetness
of
peril
not
that
of
repose
something
beyond
any
connection
that
might
have
been
formed
with
maritzl
of
stojenrosek
had
she
laid
some
witchery
upon
him
to
make
it
so
not
being
herself
affected
seek
her
out
anywhere
discover
if
that
enchantment
were
forever
could
such
things
be
witchery
was
something
which
like
death
he
had
no
more
than
heard
of
from
the
world
beyond
his
world
when
he
was
a
lad
in
the
village
among
the
spurs
of
the
shining
mountains
there
was
the
fat
old
woman
who
had
grown
so
dreadfully
thin
all
in
a
week
and
people
saying
it
was
witchery
on
her
the
priest
came
with
his
oils
but
it
was
too
late
and
she
died
the
next
day
and
no
one
ever
found
the
witch
if
there
were
one
oh
aye
there
were
prosecutions
of
witchery
in
town
and
now
the
s
wife
lalette
the
blue
star
and
he
himself
caught
into
something
he
did
not
understand
and
which
made
him
afraid
and
because
he
had
done
no
more
than
cherish
high
ideals
and
obey
orders
the
pains
were
less
but
all
his
muscles
so
immobile
that
they
afforded
no
yielding
to
the
throw
of
the
cart
and
thus
piled
bruise
on
bruise
a
long
ride
it
must
be
after
the
meridian
of
the
sun
though
even
heightened
perception
would
not
tell
him
if
this
were
so
since
he
had
lost
all
sense
of
direction
in
the
intricacy
of
the
turnings
the
mule
s
feet
and
cart
s
tires
struck
paving
stones
the
movement
became
uneven
voices
were
audible
and
they
were
entering
a
town
so
that
rodvard
began
to
hope
of
a
with
that
hope
a
fear
of
what
would
happen
if
there
were
no
rescue
what
did
the
man
mean
to
do
with
him
he
found
no
visible
answer
for
though
it
was
evident
that
though
the
repulsive
spouses
were
minded
for
murders
and
himself
not
the
first
to
fall
into
their
clutches
it
hardly
seemed
they
would
have
fixed
the
mechanician
s
badge
on
his
breast
in
mere
anticipation
of
disposing
of
a
body
droll
to
think
of
oneself
as
a
idea
he
did
not
remember
having
held
before
ever
his
mind
achieved
a
wedding
between
this
line
of
thought
and
the
earlier
one
or
how
it
was
when
that
urge
toward
the
countess
aiella
had
slipped
out
of
merely
playing
a
part
into
deep
desire
it
was
the
voice
of
body
speaking
to
body
but
it
was
not
that
way
on
the
widow
s
bed
that
night
it
was
as
though
a
flame
sprang
up
to
which
their
bodies
responded
last
of
all
ah
maritzl
he
thought
with
you
also
there
might
have
been
such
a
union
of
flames
to
last
forever
and
ever
only
i
did
not
know
i
did
not
dare
before
the
blue
star
had
bound
me
to
this
other
now
a
certain
brightening
of
the
diffused
light
reflected
into
the
cart
told
him
they
were
passing
houses
with
walls
by
this
with
the
time
and
distance
they
must
be
in
sedad
vix
city
odors
floated
to
water
fish
the
spicy
products
of
the
south
not
unpleasantly
blended
the
docks
was
the
man
going
to
make
him
a
body
by
heaving
him
into
the
sea
to
his
futile
angers
was
added
that
of
not
being
able
to
see
the
old
rascal
s
the
blue
star
had
recovered
its
virtue
under
the
s
there
was
time
for
little
more
of
thinking
for
the
cart
drew
up
with
a
cry
to
the
mule
the
driver
got
down
heavily
his
feet
sounding
on
stones
and
then
on
plank
he
was
gone
briefly
rodvard
felt
the
covering
taken
from
him
and
with
a
grunt
he
was
hoisted
to
a
shoulder
stiff
as
a
log
a
whirling
view
of
pallid
dockside
houses
the
masts
of
a
tall
ship
with
her
sails
hanging
in
disorderly
loops
he
came
down
with
a
jar
that
shook
every
bone
onto
what
appeared
to
be
some
structure
projecting
from
the
deck
where
a
red
face
surrounded
by
whisker
looked
into
his
own
one
eye
in
the
face
was
only
a
globule
of
spoiled
milk
the
cold
blue
star
on
rodvard
s
heart
told
him
the
good
eye
held
both
cruelty
and
greed
yah
said
redface
the
fish
is
i
tell
you
now
live
as
an
eel
fetch
a
redface
reached
out
a
hand
and
pinched
rodvard
s
cheek
hard
mmmmb
a
spada
s
worth
of
life
to
save
argument
i
ll
give
you
ey
look
at
him
a
proved
mechanician
with
a
badge
and
all
i
say
to
you
my
old
woman
she
has
done
with
him
so
he
ll
work
like
a
clock
pick
pick
never
mind
time
nor
nothing
a
gold
scuderius
you
should
give
me
they
chaffered
horribly
over
his
body
while
rodvard
lay
moveless
as
a
statue
thinking
of
how
he
was
one
alas
not
cradled
in
light
and
speed
like
the
wingèd
man
to
whom
he
had
compared
count
cleudi
when
cleudi
marked
the
resemblance
between
them
not
upborne
by
spirit
like
the
figure
of
the
but
a
stiff
corpse
subject
of
a
sale
a
carcass
a
beef
he
heard
the
chink
of
money
passing
the
man
gave
an
order
that
rodvard
was
to
be
taken
below
and
someone
carried
him
awkwardly
with
many
bumpings
down
a
ladder
to
a
tight
room
smelling
of
dirty
humans
he
was
tossed
high
onto
a
kind
of
shelf
and
left
alone
for
a
long
time
thinking
all
the
while
of
what
the
had
said
about
his
being
witched
to
work
like
a
clock
and
wondering
whether
it
were
true
after
a
while
a
doze
came
upon
him
for
which
there
was
no
emergence
till
the
round
hole
in
the
ship
s
wall
had
ceased
to
give
light
the
place
filled
suddenly
then
with
feet
and
words
many
of
the
latter
with
a
kjermanash
accent
or
in
that
language
itself
one
of
these
persons
pointed
to
him
and
there
was
a
laugh
rodvard
tried
to
turn
his
head
and
to
his
surprise
found
it
would
move
a
tiny
arc
though
by
an
effort
that
redoubled
the
agony
throughout
the
bruised
mass
of
his
body
yet
the
stirring
was
a
joy
as
great
as
any
he
had
ever
experienced
and
he
lay
repeating
it
as
the
assemblage
as
all
and
went
with
pannikins
from
which
floated
an
appetizing
perfume
of
stew
rodvard
found
other
movements
beside
his
head
and
lay
repeating
them
through
the
twinge
of
pain
a
whistle
blew
some
of
the
men
went
out
and
up
while
the
others
undressed
noisily
put
out
the
light
and
composed
themselves
for
sleep
on
shelves
like
that
which
bore
the
young
man
for
him
there
was
little
sleep
and
as
life
flowed
along
ankylosed
muscles
he
was
invaded
by
a
sense
of
irrevocable
disgrace
so
poignant
that
it
drowned
fear
damaris
the
maid
he
had
sold
his
soul
for
a
copper
there
not
that
he
felt
to
the
girl
any
profound
debt
as
to
lalette
or
that
such
a
debt
were
whether
from
the
priests
teaching
at
the
academy
or
the
words
of
remigorius
he
had
somehow
grown
into
a
pattern
of
life
which
being
violated
one
was
cast
down
into
a
sea
of
life
by
merest
impulse
ah
no
should
it
not
be
rather
that
each
event
must
be
judged
by
itself
and
no
by
what
standard
shall
one
judge
impulse
or
an
absolute
there
is
no
third
choice
so
thinking
so
seeking
to
find
a
clue
to
conduct
or
to
justify
his
own
merely
rodvard
told
himself
in
a
moment
of
bitterness
he
lay
on
his
comfortless
couch
aware
that
the
ship
had
begun
to
move
with
uneasy
tremors
and
presently
dawn
began
to
flower
at
the
room
s
entrance
a
lantern
showed
a
bearded
face
into
which
a
whistle
was
thrust
to
blow
piercingly
all
the
men
leaped
from
their
shelves
with
a
gabble
like
a
common
growl
and
began
dressing
in
the
greatest
haste
the
bearded
man
shoved
through
them
and
shook
rodvard
so
rudely
that
he
was
jerked
from
his
shelf
coming
down
thump
on
the
deck
with
feet
that
would
not
hold
him
rouse
out
said
the
bearded
man
catching
him
a
clout
across
the
headbone
you
lazy
scum
of
shore
mechanicians
must
learn
to
leap
when
the
mate
rodvard
staggered
amid
coarse
laughter
but
having
no
means
of
protest
followed
the
kjermanash
who
were
scrambling
rapidly
up
the
ladder
they
were
in
open
sea
the
breeze
was
light
the
day
clear
and
the
air
fine
but
even
so
the
slight
motion
gave
him
a
frightful
qualm
his
first
steps
were
across
the
deck
to
the
rail
where
he
retched
up
all
that
lay
on
his
stomach
which
was
very
little
you
what
s
your
name
said
the
bearded
mate
i
call
you
go
forward
to
the
mainmast
eat
your
breakfast
if
you
can
and
then
repair
the
iron
fitting
that
holds
the
repetend
the
carpenter
s
cabinet
under
the
break
of
the
prowhouse
will
give
you
can
not
use
tools
i
clerk
not
a
death
and
dragons
come
aft
with
me
you
cunilingous
bastard
the
mate
s
hand
missed
rodvard
s
neck
but
caught
a
clutch
of
jacket
at
the
shoulder
and
dragged
him
along
the
deck
to
where
a
flight
of
steps
went
up
and
the
captain
stood
an
ocular
under
his
arm
captain
betzensteg
this
lump
of
excrement
says
it
knows
nothing
of
sick
though
he
was
rodvard
felt
the
blue
star
burn
cold
and
looked
up
into
an
eye
brimming
with
something
more
than
mere
fury
something
strange
from
which
his
mind
turned
diddled
by
the
service
said
the
voice
between
heavy
lips
when
throw
your
can
of
piss
up
rodvard
was
jerked
against
the
steps
striking
his
shin
and
stumbled
up
by
using
his
hands
the
captain
reached
out
and
ripped
the
badge
from
his
breast
tearing
the
cloth
go
below
said
he
and
tell
my
boy
he
s
promoted
to
seaman
you
shall
serve
my
yes
sir
said
rodvard
and
looked
around
for
his
route
since
all
the
architecture
of
a
ship
was
stranger
to
him
than
that
of
a
cathedral
go
said
the
captain
and
lifted
an
arm
as
though
to
strike
him
with
the
ocular
but
changed
his
mind
what
held
you
from
telling
your
status
nothing
said
rodvard
and
gripped
the
rail
of
the
for
his
gorge
began
rising
within
if
you
puke
on
my
deck
you
shall
lick
it
the
captain
turned
his
back
and
shouted
lift
the
topper
down
the
stairs
again
there
were
not
so
many
ways
to
choose
from
so
he
took
to
the
door
to
the
right
hoping
under
his
mind
that
this
would
be
an
omen
along
a
passage
and
into
a
room
where
a
lad
of
maybe
eighteen
was
folding
a
cloth
from
a
table
you
are
captain
betzensteg
s
boy
asked
rodvard
trying
to
keep
from
looking
through
the
window
where
the
rocked
slowly
up
and
down
i
am
to
say
you
are
promoted
the
lad
s
mouth
popped
open
as
though
driven
by
a
spring
he
dropped
the
napery
and
ran
around
the
table
to
seize
rodvard
by
both
arms
truly
if
you
trick
for
one
instant
pale
eyes
flashed
fury
and
the
small
down
before
first
shaving
trembled
but
he
must
have
seen
honesty
before
him
born
for
the
sea
and
freedom
his
thought
read
and
quickly
thrust
past
to
make
for
the
door
stay
said
rodvard
holding
him
by
the
jacket
will
you
not
show
the
spasm
caught
him
and
he
retched
mouth
full
of
sour
spittle
the
lad
turned
laughing
but
without
malice
and
clapped
him
on
the
back
heave
hearty
he
said
it
will
come
better
when
you
come
to
learn
the
free
way
of
the
ocean
grow
to
love
it
and
care
nothing
for
landlouts
here
are
the
he
opened
the
midmost
of
a
set
of
drawers
built
into
the
wall
the
old
man
takes
no
napkins
save
when
there
are
guests
real
dog
of
the
brine
with
in
his
veins
that
one
i
am
called
krotz
what
s
your
name
rodvard
s
telling
he
hardly
seemed
to
notice
but
continued
his
flood
of
instructions
in
these
racks
are
the
silvers
he
uses
only
the
best
and
be
careful
at
dinner
to
set
his
silver
bear
on
the
table
it
was
given
him
by
the
syndics
at
the
time
of
the
tritulaccan
war
for
his
seamanlike
skill
the
you
must
carefully
fold
in
at
the
base
but
he
likes
the
top
loose
so
wine
always
with
the
early
meals
it
is
here
if
the
weather
s
fair
he
sometimes
takes
in
the
evening
if
he
orders
it
the
lad
krotz
halted
looked
sidewise
out
of
his
eyes
and
leaned
close
hark
bergelin
i
am
not
what
you
would
call
jealous
have
you
is
when
he
has
he
may
desire
to
treat
you
as
his
rodvard
recoiled
and
retched
again
ah
do
not
be
so
dainty
it
is
something
that
every
true
seaman
must
learn
and
keeps
us
from
being
like
the
landlouts
you
do
not
know
how
it
can
be
and
he
gives
you
silver
spadas
after
but
if
you
will
not
listen
all
the
better
when
the
old
man
calls
for
his
set
the
bottle
on
the
table
take
away
the
silver
bear
and
call
said
rodvard
no
little
astonished
that
the
emotion
of
which
the
blue
star
spoke
was
indeed
jealousy
no
i
ll
have
none
of
it
a
smile
of
delight
so
pure
that
rodvard
wondered
how
he
had
thought
the
lad
s
look
sullen
the
cook
will
give
you
breakfast
i
must
be
a
captain
betzensteg
ate
by
himself
rodvard
was
glad
that
he
remembered
the
silver
bear
but
when
he
tried
to
hold
forward
the
platter
of
meat
as
he
remembered
seeing
mathurin
do
it
for
cleudi
he
got
things
wrong
of
course
and
the
man
growled
not
there
you
fool
the
other
the
meat
itself
was
something
with
much
grease
pork
probably
which
it
sickened
rodvard
even
to
look
at
as
the
captain
chewed
liquidly
pointing
with
his
fork
to
a
corner
of
the
cabin
and
declaring
he
would
barber
someone
of
his
ears
unless
it
were
kept
cleaner
that
night
there
was
no
call
for
rodvard
felt
a
surge
of
gratitude
for
preservation
as
he
cleared
up
after
the
meal
and
made
his
way
forward
to
the
crew
quarters
in
what
he
now
had
learned
to
be
the
sickness
sent
him
to
his
shelf
at
once
for
the
movement
of
the
ship
was
becoming
more
vivid
as
twilight
fell
but
sleep
had
not
yet
reached
him
when
there
was
a
change
of
duty
as
in
the
morning
and
of
those
who
came
tumbling
down
the
ladder
krotz
was
one
he
was
much
less
the
lord
of
the
earth
than
earlier
no
sooner
was
the
lad
in
place
than
all
the
kjermanash
were
after
him
unmercifully
with
hoots
and
ribald
remarks
pinching
his
cheeks
and
his
behind
till
at
the
last
the
lad
crying
let
me
alone
flung
his
arms
out
so
wildly
that
he
caught
one
of
the
sailors
a
clip
on
the
nose
and
sent
him
staggering
the
fellow
snarled
like
a
tiger
all
his
rough
humor
dissolved
in
black
bile
and
recovering
whipped
out
a
tongue
of
steel
but
rodvard
without
knowing
how
or
why
he
did
so
rolled
from
his
shelf
onto
the
shoulder
and
arm
that
held
the
knife
bearing
the
man
to
the
floor
the
kjermanash
fought
upward
rodvard
took
two
or
three
nasty
blows
on
the
side
of
the
head
as
he
clung
with
both
his
hands
to
the
dagger
and
knew
with
more
interest
than
fear
that
he
must
lose
in
the
end
to
the
overbearing
strength
of
the
man
but
just
as
he
was
giving
way
a
pair
of
hands
beneath
the
armpits
wrenched
him
clear
and
flung
him
against
the
shelves
while
a
big
foot
kicked
the
knife
what
s
here
demanded
the
voice
of
the
bearded
mate
you
ll
have
a
dozen
lashes
for
this
damme
if
you
don
t
you
to
attack
a
seaman
said
rodvard
feeling
of
his
head
he
would
have
knifed
ser
ser
the
mate
barked
derision
and
his
head
darted
round
like
a
snake
s
is
this
veritable
all
the
kjermanash
began
cawing
together
the
mate
appeared
to
comprehend
their
babble
for
after
a
minute
or
two
of
it
he
held
up
his
hand
with
shut
up
i
see
it
this
is
the
three
days
pay
stopped
for
knifing
as
for
you
your
punishment
s
remitted
but
in
the
future
you
ll
sleep
in
the
lazarette
to
teach
you
your
true
status
aboard
this
he
turned
to
the
ladder
and
not
a
word
from
the
kjermanash
for
once
but
as
they
glowered
among
themselves
young
krotz
came
to
throw
his
arms
around
rodvard
i
owe
you
a
life
he
said
at
the
edge
of
tears
said
rodvard
but
i
will
pay
for
ah
no
surely
buy
you
i
did
not
know
there
was
status
aboard
a
you
said
the
life
on
one
was
free
as
a
why
so
it
is
indeed
but
not
for
lack
of
status
which
is
the
natural
order
of
things
are
you
an
amorosian
it
nearly
slipped
off
rodvard
s
lips
that
he
was
rather
of
the
sons
of
the
new
day
but
krotz
words
showed
how
little
he
would
find
such
a
confession
acceptable
and
he
did
not
trust
the
kjermanash
and
by
another
morning
the
ship
s
motion
told
on
him
somewhat
less
heavily
charalkis
the
depth
and
rise
it
would
be
maybe
on
the
fourth
day
out
for
time
had
little
meaning
on
that
wide
blue
field
when
rodvard
remarked
how
at
the
evening
meal
captain
betzensteg
took
more
than
usual
wine
glowering
sullenly
at
his
plate
while
he
jabbed
a
piece
of
bread
into
gravies
as
though
they
had
done
him
a
harm
the
last
mouthful
vanished
he
sucked
fingers
undaintily
and
without
looking
up
said
set
out
the
rodvard
felt
a
cold
sweat
of
peril
the
silver
bear
leaped
from
his
fingers
and
it
was
his
fortune
that
he
caught
it
before
it
reached
the
floor
the
captain
sat
with
eyes
down
not
appearing
to
notice
bottle
clacked
on
table
the
man
poured
himself
a
deep
draught
and
at
the
sound
of
the
door
opening
said
rodvard
turned
both
the
captain
s
hands
were
on
the
table
gripping
the
winecup
and
he
was
staring
into
it
as
though
it
were
a
miniature
of
his
beloved
come
fear
but
what
could
one
do
or
say
rodvard
glided
to
his
post
in
behind
the
chair
for
a
long
breathless
moment
no
sound
but
the
steady
pace
of
someone
on
the
deck
above
muted
slap
of
waves
and
clatter
of
ship
s
gear
then
the
head
came
up
rodvard
saw
how
the
rich
lips
were
working
and
in
that
single
eye
read
not
only
the
horrible
lust
he
had
expected
but
that
which
gave
him
something
akin
to
pity
a
ghastly
agony
of
spirit
a
question
that
read
shall
i
never
be
free
captain
betzensteg
lifted
the
cup
in
his
two
hands
and
tossed
off
the
contents
at
a
gulp
gagged
gave
a
growl
of
arrgh
and
reaching
up
his
left
hand
ran
it
pattingly
over
rodvard
s
buttocks
no
said
the
young
man
under
his
breath
pulling
away
the
captain
jerked
to
his
feet
violently
oversetting
his
chair
and
with
distorted
face
drove
his
fist
against
the
table
idiot
he
cried
do
you
not
know
your
benefit
and
reaching
to
his
purse
tossed
clanking
against
the
bottle
a
handful
of
coins
rodvard
shrunk
away
and
giving
a
kind
of
mewing
cry
as
the
creature
leaped
tried
for
the
door
his
foot
caught
something
he
took
three
desperate
lunges
gripped
the
handle
as
the
huge
fist
caught
the
side
of
his
head
and
spilled
him
through
onto
the
deck
senseless
ii
when
next
he
knew
there
was
a
sour
smell
of
wine
it
was
dark
and
dripping
sounded
he
could
not
think
through
the
curtain
of
headache
the
scampering
was
undoubtedly
rat
but
why
where
was
added
to
why
with
slowly
gathering
on
the
ship
certainly
since
the
bare
boards
on
which
he
lay
heaved
with
a
slow
and
even
beat
the
right
side
of
his
neck
was
sore
and
the
opposite
soreness
was
on
his
head
he
thought
ah
for
why
am
i
so
punished
and
heaved
himself
upon
an
elbow
to
find
a
pannikin
of
water
by
his
side
which
he
drank
greedily
it
was
dark
a
kind
of
velvet
twilight
yet
not
so
dark
that
he
failed
to
make
out
that
he
lay
prisoned
in
a
narrow
passage
between
tall
casks
that
rose
on
either
hand
groaning
in
their
lashings
the
quantity
of
light
must
mean
day
was
outside
and
he
had
lain
a
long
time
now
he
came
afoot
and
wondered
whether
he
should
seek
the
deck
but
decided
contrary
since
someone
for
some
reason
had
brought
him
here
and
there
might
be
perils
abroad
sleep
ah
no
he
sat
down
to
think
out
his
situation
but
could
make
no
sense
of
any
part
therefore
abandoned
the
effort
and
with
a
tinge
of
regret
over
his
lost
books
let
his
mind
run
along
the
line
of
iren
dostal
s
sweet
rhymes
until
tears
reached
his
eyes
this
could
not
occupy
him
forever
either
a
profound
and
trembling
ennui
came
on
him
so
his
fingers
made
small
motions
tracing
out
an
imaginary
design
a
long
time
a
step
sounded
coming
down
from
somewhere
and
then
along
among
the
casks
krotz
he
said
you
must
be
careful
oh
do
not
make
a
noise
he
would
hurt
me
if
he
knew
i
helped
you
in
the
gloom
something
was
thrust
against
rodvard
s
hand
which
by
the
touch
he
knew
for
a
dish
of
congealing
food
what
is
it
he
asked
i
was
struck
and
lost
you
truly
do
not
know
i
thought
it
was
feigned
when
you
failed
to
speak
as
he
said
you
were
to
be
thrown
overside
and
he
took
the
young
a
shout
sounded
flatly
from
above
oh
i
could
hurt
him
i
must
the
last
words
went
dim
as
krotz
disappeared
among
the
tall
columns
of
casks
and
rodvard
was
left
to
his
meditations
the
food
was
a
stew
of
lamb
and
it
tasted
like
dark
had
come
before
the
lad
did
again
with
a
meal
even
worse
than
its
foregoer
trembling
and
unwilling
to
talk
rodvard
found
himself
fingering
round
the
great
casks
from
one
curve
to
another
counting
the
planks
in
them
and
thinking
whether
there
might
not
be
some
mathematical
relation
in
the
figures
he
counted
a
futile
thing
to
do
he
told
himself
wishing
he
had
remigorius
philosophy
who
often
spoke
of
how
a
man
should
be
complete
in
himself
since
each
one
lives
in
a
cell
of
pellucid
glass
and
may
touch
another
only
with
not
through
that
veil
ah
bah
it
is
not
true
he
thought
i
have
been
touched
sharply
enough
by
this
very
remigorius
but
for
whom
i
d
not
be
in
such
a
coil
with
lalette
and
damaris
ideals
thrown
down
and
on
a
mad
voyage
to
nowhere
there
was
something
wrong
with
this
on
which
he
could
not
put
the
now
he
fell
to
counting
the
planks
again
or
try
to
make
a
poem
ending
the
effort
with
an
inward
twitter
as
though
mice
were
running
under
his
skin
as
he
waited
not
with
patience
for
the
next
arrival
of
krotz
with
his
purloined
food
the
lad
was
faithful
but
always
looking
over
his
shoulder
trembling
so
that
it
was
nearly
impossible
to
get
two
consecutive
words
from
him
by
which
it
came
about
that
there
was
no
plan
for
rodvard
s
escape
when
the
word
was
that
charalkis
head
had
come
in
sight
the
ship
would
lie
that
night
in
the
harbor
of
mancherei
s
capital
and
what
counsel
now
shifting
his
feet
like
a
dancer
krotz
said
he
thought
rodvard
might
easily
slip
past
the
into
the
water
but
this
scheme
split
on
the
fact
that
he
lacked
the
skill
of
swimming
all
was
still
undecided
that
night
a
sharp
sword
of
apprehension
pricked
his
fitful
sleep
nor
were
matters
amended
when
he
was
fully
roused
by
hammerings
over
the
doors
of
his
prison
kjermanash
voices
sounded
their
customary
cackle
a
shaft
of
light
struck
down
so
brilliant
that
rodvard
s
eyes
could
scarcely
bear
it
and
he
shrank
back
along
the
hands
over
face
it
was
not
the
best
means
of
hiding
down
swung
one
of
the
kjermanash
to
fix
the
tackle
for
lifting
out
the
cargo
gave
a
whoop
and
pounced
being
presently
joined
by
other
sailors
there
was
much
laughter
and
excited
talk
in
their
own
language
they
patted
rodvard
and
tweaked
the
hair
on
his
face
then
urged
him
up
the
ladder
deckward
with
and
a
that
banged
him
in
the
crotch
from
behind
as
he
climbed
blinking
at
the
top
he
stumbled
out
on
a
deck
where
the
mate
stood
wrinkling
eyes
against
the
sun
by
the
service
i
thought
you
had
been
long
ago
ohé
captain
here
s
your
cheating
mechanician
now
rodvard
noticed
that
captain
betzensteg
was
a
few
paces
beyond
talking
to
a
man
in
a
decent
grey
jacket
and
a
hat
but
wearing
no
badge
of
status
the
monster
turned
and
his
full
lips
twisted
put
him
in
the
lazarette
with
chains
since
he
s
so
slippery
well
have
the
trial
at
the
single
eye
looked
on
rodvard
and
it
said
one
thing
the
young
man
staggered
he
cried
desperately
i
a
captain
s
judge
on
his
own
ship
i
reject
your
appeal
take
him
said
the
man
in
grey
a
moment
ser
captain
this
is
not
good
law
for
the
dominion
of
mancherei
in
whose
authority
you
now
stand
we
have
one
judge
that
stands
above
every
mortal
protestation
that
is
the
god
of
love
whose
law
was
set
forward
by
our
the
captain
snarled
black
and
sour
this
is
my
ship
i
order
you
to
leave
the
man
in
the
grey
jacket
had
a
thin
ascetic
face
one
eyebrow
jagged
upward
this
is
our
port
i
order
you
to
leave
it
without
discharging
a
single
item
of
your
you
dare
not
our
has
no
rule
in
mancherei
that
was
tried
out
at
the
time
of
the
tritulaccan
war
young
ser
what
is
the
ground
of
your
appeal
to
our
law
the
blue
star
was
cold
as
cold
on
rodvard
s
heart
but
there
seemed
a
bright
shimmer
like
a
haze
in
the
eyes
that
met
his
and
not
a
thought
could
he
make
out
through
it
he
said
because
the
captain
of
this
ship
would
be
both
jury
and
he
lies
growled
betzensteg
my
underofficer
is
the
accuser
for
that
this
man
refused
to
repair
a
that
is
a
question
of
fact
to
be
decided
by
a
court
which
can
gain
nothing
from
the
decision
said
the
man
in
grey
calmly
he
swung
to
rodvard
young
man
do
you
place
yourself
in
the
justice
of
mancherei
to
accept
the
rule
and
decision
of
its
authority
oh
yes
cried
rodvard
willing
to
do
anything
to
escape
the
terror
of
that
baneful
optic
the
man
in
grey
produced
a
small
paper
scroll
and
touched
rodvard
lightly
on
the
arm
then
i
do
declare
you
under
the
law
of
the
prophet
of
mancherei
and
you
ser
captain
will
interfere
at
your
gravest
peril
young
man
take
your
place
in
my
iii
rodvard
was
motioned
to
the
bow
of
the
craft
from
which
floated
a
banner
with
a
device
much
resembling
a
dove
but
it
was
in
the
false
heraldry
of
grey
on
white
and
hard
to
make
out
spray
was
salt
on
his
face
as
they
reached
a
stone
dock
a
ladder
was
lowered
down
and
he
would
have
waited
for
the
grey
man
but
the
latter
motioned
him
imperiously
to
go
up
first
the
pierside
street
hummed
with
an
activity
that
to
rodvard
seemed
far
more
purposeful
than
that
of
languid
netznegon
with
horses
and
drays
porters
bearing
packages
men
on
horseback
or
in
little
caleches
pausing
to
talk
to
each
other
under
the
striped
shadows
thrown
across
the
wharfs
by
a
forest
of
tall
masts
their
clothes
were
different
from
a
tavern
came
a
sound
of
song
though
it
was
early
in
the
morning
it
seemed
to
rodvard
that
most
of
the
people
were
more
cheerful
than
those
of
his
homeland
and
he
thought
it
might
be
that
the
prophet
s
rule
had
something
to
do
with
it
this
way
said
one
of
the
and
touched
him
on
the
arm
he
was
guided
across
the
dock
and
up
to
a
pillared
door
where
persons
hurried
in
and
out
what
is
your
name
asked
the
grey
man
pausing
on
the
step
made
an
annotation
then
said
to
the
rower
guide
take
him
to
the
hawkhead
tavern
and
see
that
he
has
breakfast
here
is
your
warrant
i
will
send
archers
for
the
complaining
mate
but
i
do
not
think
the
court
will
hear
the
case
before
the
tenth
glass
of
the
i
am
a
prisoner
asked
rodvard
the
other
s
face
showed
no
break
no
but
you
will
find
it
hard
to
run
far
be
warned
if
you
are
not
condemned
unheard
no
more
are
you
released
because
the
accuser
overrode
his
right
the
doctrine
of
our
prophet
gives
every
grace
but
not
until
every
debt
is
paid
and
the
learner
finds
by
what
it
was
he
has
been
he
made
a
perfunctory
salutation
and
turned
on
his
heel
rodvard
went
with
the
rower
a
burly
man
in
a
shirt
with
no
jacket
over
it
asking
as
he
strode
along
what
was
it
he
meant
by
saying
i
d
find
it
hard
to
run
far
the
face
composed
in
wrinkles
of
astonishment
why
he
s
an
initiate
you
d
no
more
than
think
on
an
evasion
when
the
guards
would
be
at
your
rodvard
looked
at
him
in
and
a
shiver
ran
through
him
at
the
thought
that
these
people
of
the
prophet
might
somehow
have
learned
to
read
minds
without
the
intervention
of
any
blue
star
a
thing
he
had
heard
before
only
as
a
rumor
what
he
said
to
change
the
subject
i
see
no
badges
of
status
anywhere
is
it
true
that
you
have
none
in
mancherei
the
man
made
a
face
no
status
in
the
least
that
is
what
the
learners
and
diaconals
say
in
their
he
looked
across
his
shoulder
they
ll
give
you
status
enough
though
if
you
hold
to
their
diet
of
greens
and
fish
bah
here
we
the
breakfast
was
not
fish
but
an
excellent
casserole
of
chicken
served
by
a
maid
who
slapped
the
rower
when
he
reached
for
her
knee
he
laughed
like
a
waterfall
and
ordered
black
ale
rodvard
hardly
heard
him
eating
away
with
appetite
in
a
little
world
of
himself
alone
hope
mingling
with
danger
at
the
back
of
his
mind
so
that
it
was
a
surprise
when
the
rower
nudged
him
and
stood
the
reckoning
s
made
for
you
bogolan
he
said
come
the
meridian
you
ve
only
to
ask
for
bread
and
cheese
and
beer
go
out
wander
see
our
city
but
do
not
fail
to
return
by
the
tenth
glass
and
take
notice
your
dossolan
coin
will
buy
nothing
in
shops
here
it
is
a
crime
to
take
such
he
swaggered
out
the
last
words
recalled
rodvard
to
his
penniless
condition
and
he
looked
along
himself
uncomfortably
seeing
for
the
first
time
how
the
black
servant
s
costume
he
had
from
mathurin
was
all
streaked
dirty
and
odorous
with
a
tear
at
the
breast
where
the
badge
had
been
wrenched
off
there
was
no
desire
to
present
himself
to
the
world
in
such
an
appearance
he
shrank
back
behind
the
table
into
the
angle
made
by
panelling
and
the
tall
settee
to
think
and
wait
out
his
time
watching
the
room
around
him
on
the
floor
of
the
place
the
press
of
breakfasters
was
relaxing
maids
were
deliberate
over
clattering
dishes
calling
to
one
another
in
strong
harsh
voices
he
could
not
catch
the
eye
of
any
to
use
his
blue
star
in
reading
her
thought
which
might
have
been
a
pastime
and
his
own
affairs
were
in
such
suspense
and
turmoil
that
thinking
seemed
little
use
after
a
while
the
shame
of
merely
crouching
there
overcame
that
of
his
garb
so
he
got
up
and
went
outside
the
town
was
in
full
tide
and
noisy
there
was
no
clear
vista
in
any
direction
the
streets
lacking
netznegon
city
s
long
boulevards
angling
and
winding
instead
the
buildings
were
set
well
apart
from
each
other
rodvard
feared
being
lost
among
the
intricacies
of
these
avenues
therefore
formed
the
design
of
keeping
buildings
on
his
right
hand
and
so
going
around
a
square
crossing
no
streets
which
must
ultimately
bring
him
safely
to
his
the
district
was
one
of
houses
of
commerce
mingled
with
tall
tenements
a
droll
fact
there
were
no
children
in
sight
in
the
were
many
articles
of
clothing
so
beautifully
made
they
might
have
been
worn
by
lords
and
princesses
he
did
not
see
many
other
goods
save
in
one
window
that
displayed
a
quantity
of
clerks
materials
rolls
of
parchment
quills
and
books
nearly
all
finely
arabesqued
or
set
him
to
wondering
about
what
manner
of
clerks
worked
with
such
tools
the
inn
swung
round
its
circle
to
present
him
its
door
again
it
was
not
yet
the
meridian
therefore
he
crossed
the
street
and
made
another
circuit
this
time
reaching
a
street
where
there
were
many
warehouses
with
carts
unloading
round
the
turn
from
this
was
a
house
of
religion
with
the
two
pillars
surmounted
by
an
arch
as
in
dossola
but
the
arch
was
altered
by
being
marked
with
the
device
of
a
pair
of
clasped
hands
carved
in
wood
a
man
came
out
like
the
one
who
had
rescued
rodvard
from
the
ship
he
was
dressed
in
grey
the
look
of
his
face
and
cant
of
his
head
were
so
like
the
other
s
that
rodvard
almost
spoke
to
him
before
discovering
he
was
heavier
built
the
grey
clothing
must
be
a
kind
of
uniform
or
costume
a
wall
bordered
the
grounds
of
this
building
with
a
cobbled
alley
which
had
a
trickle
down
its
middle
rodvard
followed
it
pausing
to
look
at
placards
which
lay
one
over
the
other
proclaiming
now
a
festival
for
a
byegone
date
the
departure
of
a
ship
for
tritulacca
a
notice
against
the
perusal
of
the
latest
book
by
prince
pavinius
or
a
fair
for
the
sale
of
goods
made
by
certain
persons
called
the
myonessae
a
new
word
to
rodvard
the
alley
at
length
carried
him
to
face
the
inn
again
he
wished
for
a
book
to
beguile
the
time
but
that
being
a
vain
desire
went
in
to
seek
his
former
place
not
until
he
sat
down
did
he
see
that
the
nook
opposite
him
was
occupied
it
was
a
little
man
hunched
in
a
long
cloak
so
old
that
his
nose
hooked
over
his
chin
making
him
look
like
a
bird
before
him
was
a
mug
of
pale
beer
he
was
deep
in
thought
and
did
not
look
up
as
rodvard
sat
down
but
after
a
moment
or
two
sipped
smacked
his
lips
and
said
work
work
work
that
s
all
they
think
said
rodvard
glad
of
any
company
it
does
not
do
to
work
too
the
gaffer
still
did
not
elevate
his
eyes
i
can
remember
i
can
how
it
used
to
be
in
the
grand
governor
s
time
before
he
called
himself
prophet
when
on
holy
days
we
did
not
labor
and
we
going
out
on
the
streets
to
watch
processions
pass
from
service
with
the
colors
and
silks
but
now
they
only
sneak
off
to
the
churches
as
though
they
were
ashamed
of
it
then
work
work
he
drank
more
of
his
beer
rodvard
was
somewhat
touched
by
his
speech
for
though
he
was
hardly
one
to
defend
amorosians
to
each
other
it
was
just
these
processions
in
silks
while
so
many
were
without
bread
that
bore
hard
on
dossola
he
said
ser
it
would
seem
to
me
that
no
man
would
worry
for
working
if
he
could
have
his
the
old
man
lifted
his
eyes
from
his
mug
rodvard
catching
behind
them
a
feeling
of
indifference
to
any
reward
but
calm
and
said
silence
for
juniors
speech
for
one
of
the
maids
approached
rodvard
asked
for
his
bread
and
cheese
and
beer
and
drew
from
her
a
smile
so
generous
that
he
looked
sharp
and
saw
that
she
would
welcome
an
advance
but
the
thought
at
the
back
of
her
mind
was
money
the
ancient
shivered
down
into
his
cloak
again
not
speaking
till
she
was
gone
then
he
said
reward
eh
what
use
is
your
reward
and
finding
money
to
spend
when
it
buys
nothing
but
gaudy
clothes
and
a
skinfull
of
liquor
no
credit
or
position
at
all
answer
me
that
i
tell
you
i
would
not
be
unhappy
if
we
went
back
to
the
old
queen
s
rule
and
that
s
the
truth
even
if
they
send
me
to
instruction
for
ser
may
i
pose
you
a
question
asked
rodvard
questions
show
proper
respect
and
willingness
to
be
taught
ask
the
food
came
rodvard
nibbled
at
his
cheese
and
asked
ser
is
it
not
better
and
freer
to
live
here
where
there
is
no
status
no
status
no
said
the
old
man
gloomily
and
there
s
the
pain
right
there
in
the
old
days
a
man
was
reasonable
secure
where
he
stood
he
could
look
up
to
those
above
and
share
their
glory
and
we
had
real
musicians
and
dancing
troupes
as
many
as
a
hundred
who
made
it
an
art
so
that
the
souls
of
those
who
watched
them
were
advanced
where
are
they
now
all
gone
off
to
dossola
and
now
all
anyone
here
can
do
is
work
work
work
grub
grub
grub
it
is
the
same
in
everything
i
can
recall
how
joyous
i
was
when
i
was
a
young
man
in
the
days
of
the
grand
governor
before
the
last
and
received
my
first
commission
which
was
to
carve
a
portrait
bust
for
count
belodon
who
was
secretary
financial
a
bust
of
his
mistress
it
was
and
i
made
it
no
higher
than
this
out
of
walrus
ivory
from
kjermanash
as
fine
a
thing
as
i
ever
did
but
now
all
they
want
is
dadoes
for
doorways
no
art
in
yet
it
would
seem
to
me
said
rodvard
that
you
have
some
security
of
life
here
so
that
no
man
need
go
hungry
if
he
will
no
spirit
in
it
will
go
on
men
working
like
ants
till
one
day
they
are
gone
and
another
ant
falls
into
their
place
no
spirit
in
it
nothing
done
for
the
joy
of
creation
so
they
must
have
laws
to
make
men
he
went
silent
staring
into
his
beer
nor
could
rodvard
draw
more
words
from
him
presently
a
young
lad
with
long
fair
hair
came
peering
down
the
line
of
booths
until
he
reached
this
one
when
he
said
that
the
old
man
whom
he
addressed
as
grandfather
must
follow
him
at
once
to
the
shop
where
he
was
wanted
for
carving
the
face
of
a
clock
decide
for
life
it
was
like
no
court
rodvard
had
ever
seen
behind
a
simple
table
sat
two
of
the
men
in
grey
their
features
calm
and
strangely
like
each
other
at
the
end
one
with
an
inkpot
and
sheets
of
paper
before
him
wrote
down
rodvard
s
name
as
it
was
given
the
guards
at
either
side
carried
no
weapons
but
short
truncheons
and
daggers
at
the
belt
the
burly
mate
was
already
in
one
chair
looking
truculent
with
a
pair
of
kjermanash
sailors
beside
him
one
of
them
a
lad
unhealthy
of
appearance
a
man
of
negligent
air
richly
dressed
occupied
the
end
of
the
table
opposite
from
the
writer
there
were
no
other
spectators
and
the
proceeding
began
without
ceremony
when
one
of
the
initiates
asked
simply
what
was
charged
against
ser
bergelin
mutiny
said
the
mate
i
gave
the
rat
a
task
to
do
which
he
flatly
the
man
said
it
is
dossolan
law
that
cases
of
mutiny
at
sea
be
tried
by
the
captain
of
the
ship
who
bears
judicial
powers
for
this
purpose
else
mutiny
would
spread
through
a
ship
i
would
have
your
writer
here
record
that
i
make
formal
demand
for
the
body
of
this
criminal
in
accordance
with
the
treaty
of
amity
and
respect
between
your
nation
and
the
queen
my
one
of
the
grey
men
said
calmly
be
it
recorded
record
also
that
the
treaty
declares
none
shall
be
delivered
before
the
adjudgment
of
guilt
for
though
we
be
all
criminous
it
is
not
love
s
desire
that
men
shall
exploit
each
other
for
anything
but
sins
determined
as
such
by
the
word
of
human
the
man
s
eyes
said
utter
disgust
his
lips
said
how
can
there
be
an
adjudgment
before
trial
it
is
to
try
him
that
we
demand
the
second
initiate
spoke
this
young
man
has
placed
himself
in
the
protection
of
the
domain
of
mancherei
before
he
is
delivered
for
trial
there
is
required
proof
of
a
that
would
merit
sentence
is
there
such
proof
why
damme
yes
said
the
mate
i
saw
the
fellow
do
it
i
heard
him
refuse
my
order
here
are
two
of
my
crew
to
say
as
he
swept
a
hand
toward
the
kjermanash
who
began
to
cackle
at
once
but
the
first
initiate
merely
nodded
to
the
writer
who
laid
the
pen
down
and
clicked
at
the
pair
in
their
own
tongue
when
they
had
answered
he
said
they
declare
it
is
true
that
he
consulted
his
sheet
was
ordered
to
repair
a
mast
and
he
the
initiate
looked
at
rodvard
and
not
a
thing
could
he
read
behind
those
cold
eyes
though
they
seemed
to
pierce
him
through
saying
the
evidence
is
sufficient
for
a
trial
unless
you
can
contradict
said
rodvard
i
could
not
make
the
repair
i
did
not
know
the
initiate
that
is
a
question
for
the
trial
to
determine
no
reason
for
not
hearing
the
the
mate
guffawed
cried
rodvard
in
despair
but
sers
this
pray
you
it
is
not
for
this
he
is
you
shall
clearly
speak
your
trouble
for
it
is
the
will
of
love
that
nothing
is
to
be
rodvard
felt
the
rosy
flush
light
up
his
cheek
well
then
it
is
not
for
any
failure
of
duty
that
this
captain
pursues
me
but
because
i
would
not
be
the
partner
of
his
unnatural
with
an
exclamation
the
ambassador
of
dossola
brought
his
hand
down
on
the
table
and
the
mate
gave
a
growl
but
the
initiates
were
as
unmoved
as
mountains
one
of
them
said
no
lust
is
more
natural
or
less
so
than
another
since
all
are
contrary
to
the
law
of
love
and
the
soul
in
which
love
runs
full
tide
may
and
should
give
to
this
unreal
world
of
matter
all
that
it
desires
without
imputation
of
sin
yet
we
do
find
that
if
the
wrong
cause
for
this
trial
has
been
stated
there
is
a
basis
of
appeal
to
our
law
we
would
hear
of
this
he
signed
the
writer
spoke
to
the
kjermanash
while
the
mate
glared
venom
at
them
his
glances
darting
from
one
to
the
other
the
seamen
seemed
hesitant
especially
the
fat
young
one
to
whom
the
writer
chiefly
addressed
himself
though
rodvard
could
not
understand
a
word
the
told
clearly
enough
how
the
tale
was
going
now
the
lad
began
to
catch
at
his
breath
and
sniffle
saying
a
few
more
words
the
mate
s
head
turned
slowly
round
hardest
murder
staring
from
his
eyes
while
his
hand
slid
slid
toward
belt
and
no
cried
rodvard
he
s
going
to
kill
him
the
mate
leaped
snarling
to
his
feet
bringing
out
the
knife
with
the
same
motion
but
rodvard
s
shout
had
quickened
the
guards
one
stepped
forward
striking
with
his
truncheon
while
the
other
seized
his
man
from
behind
arm
around
neck
a
roar
from
the
mate
squeaks
from
the
kjermanash
and
with
a
crash
of
heavy
bodies
the
big
man
was
down
and
firmly
held
cursing
and
trying
to
wring
a
broken
hand
one
of
the
initiates
said
serenely
this
is
an
act
of
then
to
the
writer
do
these
also
accuse
yes
brother
the
lesser
one
says
that
he
has
been
this
captain
s
catamite
and
that
ser
bergelin
was
to
the
captain
and
must
have
been
solicited
to
such
purpose
for
this
was
his
custom
with
all
they
say
further
that
an
order
was
given
to
throw
ser
bergelin
into
the
sea
further
they
say
they
were
instructed
as
to
what
they
should
report
on
the
repairing
of
the
love
is
illumination
said
the
initiate
his
companion
our
decision
is
that
this
mate
shall
pay
a
fine
of
ten
dossolan
scudi
for
ruffling
the
peace
of
this
court
but
for
having
brought
false
accusations
against
one
under
the
protection
of
the
prophet
he
shall
be
submitted
to
detention
of
the
body
and
instruction
in
doctrine
until
such
time
as
the
court
shall
release
the
mate
gave
a
yell
i
protest
said
the
ambassador
against
the
condemnation
of
one
of
our
gracious
queen
s
subjects
on
perjured
evidence
and
as
the
result
of
the
actions
of
one
who
is
not
only
himself
a
criminal
but
a
provocator
of
your
protest
is
recorded
we
declare
the
business
of
this
case
has
been
the
two
initiates
rose
as
though
their
muscles
were
controlled
by
a
single
mind
but
as
the
dossolan
rose
also
and
the
guards
frogmarched
their
prisoner
out
one
of
them
looked
at
rodvard
you
will
remain
young
man
he
said
ii
they
sat
down
again
one
of
them
said
be
seated
and
the
pair
stared
at
him
unmoving
with
those
impassive
eyes
the
inspection
lasted
a
good
three
or
four
minutes
rodvard
itched
and
hardly
dared
to
squirm
one
of
them
addressed
him
you
bear
a
blue
it
was
not
a
question
but
a
statement
rodvard
did
not
feel
an
answer
called
for
therefore
made
none
be
warned
said
the
second
initiate
that
it
is
somewhat
less
potent
here
than
elsewhere
since
it
is
the
command
of
the
god
of
love
that
all
shall
deal
in
truth
and
therefore
there
is
little
hidden
for
it
to
but
began
rodvard
the
initiate
held
up
his
hand
for
silence
doubtless
you
thought
that
your
charm
permitted
you
to
read
all
that
is
in
the
mind
learn
young
man
that
the
value
of
this
stone
being
founded
on
witchery
and
evil
will
teach
you
only
the
thoughts
that
stem
from
the
evil
god
as
hatred
licentiousness
cruelty
deception
now
rodvard
was
silent
thinking
swiftly
that
this
might
be
true
that
although
he
was
no
veteran
of
this
jewel
it
had
never
told
him
anything
good
about
anyone
where
is
your
witch
said
one
of
the
initiates
in
it
will
be
impossible
for
you
to
return
there
with
the
case
of
today
s
court
standing
against
you
and
the
mate
of
your
ship
in
our
detention
by
our
necessary
perhaps
in
began
rodvard
nor
can
you
well
bring
her
here
said
the
other
initiate
the
practice
of
witchery
is
not
forbidden
among
us
as
it
is
by
the
laws
of
your
country
but
we
hold
it
to
be
a
sin
against
the
god
of
love
and
it
is
required
that
those
found
in
witchery
undergo
a
period
of
instruction
in
the
couvertines
of
the
a
wild
wave
of
longing
for
lalette
swept
across
him
drowning
the
formless
regret
of
leaving
behind
the
sons
of
the
new
new
empty
no
spirit
in
it
the
old
man
had
said
before
rodvard
could
think
of
anything
to
say
one
of
the
initiates
spoke
again
all
life
in
this
material
world
is
a
turning
from
one
void
to
another
and
shall
be
escaped
only
by
filling
the
void
with
love
and
this
is
the
essence
of
a
jar
like
a
fall
from
a
height
told
him
that
he
was
facing
men
who
could
follow
his
thought
almost
as
clearly
as
he
could
that
of
others
and
rodvard
half
thought
of
how
the
butler
at
sedad
vix
had
said
it
was
possible
to
conceal
one
s
thoughts
half
wondered
what
these
strange
men
wanted
with
him
the
strong
resonant
voice
went
on
it
is
not
the
thought
of
the
mind
but
the
purpose
of
the
heart
for
which
we
seek
for
the
mind
is
as
material
as
the
world
on
which
it
creature
of
the
other
is
said
the
second
initiate
as
though
this
matter
had
now
been
settled
what
is
your
profession
i
am
a
clerk
i
was
in
the
office
of
pedigree
at
here
we
have
no
pedigrees
are
needed
but
if
you
lack
the
skill
or
desire
for
such
labor
you
may
serve
in
the
commercial
counter
which
places
for
sale
the
products
of
the
prophet
s
i
think
i
would
prefer
the
second
said
rodvard
not
really
thinking
it
at
all
for
tillage
and
commercial
clerkship
he
held
to
be
equal
miseries
yet
the
latter
might
offer
a
better
chance
of
release
the
initiates
stood
up
we
will
inform
the
stylarion
at
the
door
who
will
find
you
harborage
and
instruct
you
where
you
are
to
report
for
work
you
must
give
him
your
money
of
dossolan
coinage
which
he
will
replace
with
that
of
but
i
have
no
money
of
any
coinage
none
at
all
said
rodvard
the
two
stopped
in
their
progress
toward
the
door
and
turned
on
him
faces
which
for
the
first
time
were
struck
with
frown
one
of
them
said
severely
young
man
you
have
evidently
been
under
the
control
of
the
god
of
evil
unless
this
financial
stringency
disappears
we
shall
be
required
to
order
that
you
take
doctrinal
instruction
and
it
were
better
if
you
did
so
in
any
case
the
stylarion
will
give
you
a
warrant
for
new
garments
and
your
other
immediate
needs
but
all
must
be
strictly
repaid
and
within
no
long
they
left
rodvard
thought
their
final
remarks
a
very
strange
pendant
to
the
generosity
they
had
otherwise
shown
and
wondered
unhappily
whether
he
would
ever
see
lalette
again
iii
the
lodging
assigned
was
in
a
room
over
the
shop
of
a
tailor
named
gualdis
at
a
corner
where
three
streets
ran
together
the
man
had
a
fat
wife
and
three
daughters
one
of
whom
brought
from
a
cookshop
on
the
corner
a
big
dish
of
lentils
and
greens
with
bits
of
sausage
through
it
from
which
they
all
ate
together
the
girls
chartered
profusely
curious
as
so
many
magpies
about
rodvard
and
how
life
was
lived
in
dossola
for
they
were
too
young
to
remember
when
prince
pavinius
had
turned
from
grand
governor
to
prophet
and
the
tritulaccan
war
began
rodvard
liked
the
middle
one
best
called
leece
she
had
thick
and
vividly
black
eyebrows
that
gave
her
eyes
a
sparkle
when
she
laughed
which
was
frequently
the
blue
star
told
him
that
behind
the
sparkle
crouched
a
kind
of
dumb
question
whether
he
might
not
be
the
destined
man
and
the
thought
of
being
sought
by
her
was
not
unpleasant
to
him
but
she
turned
her
head
so
rapidly
and
talked
so
much
that
he
could
make
out
no
more
after
he
had
been
shown
to
his
bed
the
usual
sleeplessness
of
a
changed
condition
of
life
came
to
him
and
he
began
to
examine
his
thoughts
he
felt
happy
beneath
all
and
doubting
whether
he
were
entitled
to
searched
for
some
background
of
the
sense
of
approaching
peril
which
had
held
him
the
night
lalette
came
to
his
pensionnario
door
and
again
when
he
spoke
with
tuolén
the
butler
but
it
was
nowhere
all
seemed
well
in
spite
of
the
fact
that
he
was
more
or
less
a
prisoner
in
this
land
the
common
report
had
it
that
this
was
not
an
unusual
experience
that
amorosian
agents
circulated
all
through
the
homeland
recruiting
for
their
own
purposes
especially
those
with
any
touch
of
witchery
and
he
thought
that
might
be
true
the
initiate
on
the
ship
had
taken
him
very
readily
into
protection
and
if
he
were
like
those
in
the
court
must
have
known
that
rodvard
bore
a
blue
star
yet
it
seemed
to
him
that
these
amorosians
were
so
well
disposed
toward
each
other
that
one
might
do
worse
to
live
out
a
life
among
them
in
spite
of
a
certain
unearthliness
among
their
initiates
now
also
he
began
to
look
back
toward
dossola
and
to
understand
why
it
was
that
mancherei
should
be
so
hated
most
particularly
by
the
upper
orders
for
it
seemed
that
if
he
could
but
return
persuade
remigorius
mathurin
and
the
rest
how
the
people
of
the
prophet
lived
among
themselves
the
sons
of
the
new
day
might
fulfill
their
mission
by
striking
an
alliance
in
mancherei
no
never
he
answered
himself
that
would
be
to
set
the
son
above
the
parent
the
colony
over
the
homeland
and
politic
would
never
permit
it
yet
was
it
not
cardinal
in
the
thinking
of
the
sons
of
the
new
day
that
to
hold
such
a
thing
wrong
was
in
itself
wrong
the
evil
in
the
old
rule
was
that
it
set
one
man
above
another
for
no
other
reason
but
his
birth
was
not
pyax
the
zigraner
with
his
odd
smell
and
slanted
eye
entitled
to
as
much
consideration
as
baron
brunivar
why
not
then
up
with
the
standard
of
mancherei
and
its
prophet
for
that
what
had
pavinius
found
so
wrong
in
this
place
that
he
had
deserted
the
very
rule
he
founded
rodvard
twisted
in
his
bed
and
course
i
have
been
slow
indeed
to
miss
the
flaw
for
though
there
were
no
episcopals
here
the
initiates
surely
filled
their
office
if
freedom
from
tyranny
were
won
only
by
making
episcopals
into
judges
then
it
was
only
a
viler
slavery
was
life
then
a
question
of
whether
spirit
or
body
should
be
free
but
on
this
question
rodvard
found
himself
becoming
so
involved
that
he
went
to
sleep
and
did
not
wake
till
day
burned
behind
the
shutters
leece
brought
him
his
breakfast
on
a
tray
and
wished
him
a
merry
morning
but
when
he
would
have
spoken
to
her
said
she
must
hurry
to
her
employ
her
eyes
had
some
message
he
could
not
quite
read
if
the
initiates
were
right
it
would
be
a
gentle
one
and
kindly
his
mind
was
more
on
her
than
on
his
new
fortune
as
he
went
forth
and
he
missed
a
turning
in
the
streets
so
that
his
task
began
badly
with
a
tardy
arrival
the
building
of
his
toil
like
so
many
in
charalkis
was
new
and
of
brick
with
mullioned
windows
along
the
street
front
and
a
low
wide
door
at
one
side
through
which
carts
passed
empty
to
pick
up
bales
at
a
platform
within
rodvard
entered
to
see
a
row
of
clerks
on
stools
sitting
before
a
single
long
desk
and
writing
away
as
though
for
dear
life
a
short
round
man
paced
up
and
down
nervously
behind
them
now
and
again
speaking
to
one
of
the
writers
or
hearing
a
question
from
another
this
short
man
came
over
to
rodvard
and
looked
up
and
down
his
length
i
am
the
protostylarion
he
announced
are
you
bergelin
the
dossolan
clerk
you
are
in
retard
by
a
third
of
a
glass
the
fine
is
two
obulas
come
this
he
led
down
to
the
inner
end
of
the
desk
where
under
the
least
light
stood
a
vacant
stool
here
is
your
place
for
the
beginning
you
have
the
task
of
posting
to
the
records
of
individual
couvertines
from
those
of
the
general
sales
by
ships
is
a
ship
s
manifest
from
a
voyage
to
tritulacca
three
clocks
from
the
couvertine
arpik
as
you
see
have
been
sold
for
eight
reuls
tritulaccan
you
will
open
a
sheet
for
arpik
on
which
noting
this
fact
one
sheet
for
each
couvertine
then
place
a
mark
here
to
show
that
the
matter
is
cared
for
not
pausing
to
ivrigo
the
interrupter
held
his
ledger
in
hand
and
diddled
from
foot
to
foot
as
though
being
held
from
a
cabinet
of
ease
oh
ser
maltusz
i
crave
pardon
but
i
can
not
carry
through
this
posting
according
to
system
until
i
have
a
ruling
on
where
falls
the
in
such
a
hm
let
me
stupidity
look
there
it
is
plainly
stated
that
no
offer
had
been
made
on
the
said
lost
bales
they
were
therefore
couvertine
goods
still
and
not
regarding
whether
the
loss
were
caused
by
piracy
or
not
it
must
fall
he
turned
back
to
rodvard
do
not
try
to
translate
into
our
money
for
that
is
the
function
of
another
you
are
expected
to
finish
this
manifest
by
i
have
never
done
work
is
prayer
there
is
the
two
choices
the
mattern
s
name
was
dame
quasso
she
told
mircella
to
show
lalette
to
a
small
brown
room
angled
by
a
dormer
where
a
bed
with
one
blanket
a
chair
and
a
chiffonier
were
the
only
furniture
the
is
down
here
said
the
servant
pointing
the
regulation
is
that
all
demoiselles
stir
themselves
together
at
the
ringing
of
the
so
that
the
day
s
tasks
may
be
why
said
lalette
sitting
down
on
the
edge
of
the
bed
so
glad
to
hear
a
voice
without
malice
or
innuendo
in
it
that
the
words
hardly
mattered
the
eyes
were
round
and
the
mouth
was
round
a
series
of
rounds
said
mircella
it
is
the
regulation
you
must
dress
your
best
for
evening
it
is
the
day
of
the
ah
oh
some
of
them
are
quite
rich
we
will
have
roast
meat
for
supper
wouldn
t
it
be
nice
if
one
of
them
would
take
you
way
up
in
the
mountains
lalette
felt
her
heart
contract
what
do
you
mean
she
asked
i
am
from
dossola
and
this
is
all
new
to
why
the
diaconals
those
learners
who
are
in
the
second
stage
almost
initiates
so
they
can
t
be
married
and
once
a
month
they
mircella
came
dame
quasso
s
voice
impatiently
i
must
go
you
won
t
have
to
work
today
you
never
do
on
the
first
lalette
thought
what
trap
am
i
caught
in
it
was
a
diaconal
that
tegval
said
he
was
and
that
he
had
chosen
me
that
horrible
night
a
fierce
surge
of
anger
burned
through
her
at
the
widow
domijaiek
who
had
babbled
so
of
love
and
god
yet
brought
her
to
this
dubious
resort
and
once
more
as
when
she
stood
in
the
s
parlor
there
was
the
feeling
of
being
hemmed
in
by
metal
walls
but
before
her
fury
could
rise
to
the
performing
of
the
black
witchery
already
forming
at
the
back
of
her
mind
the
door
was
tapped
and
a
toothless
old
man
brought
in
her
chest
and
said
dame
quasso
awaited
her
attendance
the
entrance
broke
a
spell
lalette
was
inwardly
assuring
herself
there
was
some
mistake
the
thing
might
be
better
than
appearances
while
the
mattern
began
in
the
most
ordinary
way
to
ask
her
what
work
she
had
done
or
might
be
fitted
for
at
last
dame
quasso
said
i
do
not
know
what
you
dossolan
girls
are
trained
for
by
your
mothers
except
marriage
to
counts
no
one
of
you
can
earn
the
worth
of
her
clothing
you
know
nothing
but
i
will
place
you
with
the
stitchers
who
work
on
linen
till
you
have
learned
something
better
you
will
find
your
witchery
of
little
value
here
i
suppose
the
charge
is
justified
lalette
stamped
her
foot
all
the
fury
returning
at
this
treatment
madame
she
cried
as
i
was
brought
up
a
girl
sold
into
prostitution
had
already
earned
the
worth
of
her
clothing
and
something
else
there
was
a
silence
in
which
the
cool
hard
eyes
did
not
change
nor
the
face
around
them
and
lalette
had
the
sensation
that
if
she
looked
into
them
any
longer
she
would
drown
dame
quasso
said
sit
down
we
have
had
girls
like
you
before
and
always
they
make
me
doubtful
of
those
who
admit
you
to
the
company
of
the
myonessae
nevertheless
it
is
our
task
who
conduct
these
couvertines
to
see
that
you
are
instructed
to
a
better
way
of
life
listen
attentively
there
is
in
this
domain
of
mancherei
and
in
our
honorable
order
no
question
of
prostitution
which
concerns
those
who
sell
for
money
what
they
should
give
for
love
but
it
is
the
wise
ordinance
of
our
prophet
that
they
who
would
attain
to
the
state
of
initiates
shall
not
marry
before
quitting
this
material
body
for
that
life
which
is
the
god
of
love
for
marriage
is
viewed
with
approval
by
the
old
churches
as
though
it
were
something
to
be
desired
yet
it
is
but
a
license
to
serve
the
god
of
evil
in
whose
armory
no
weapon
is
so
potent
as
the
propagation
of
further
mankind
into
this
bodily
world
which
he
wholly
rules
therefore
it
is
ordered
that
when
one
who
has
reached
the
diaconal
estate
is
overcome
by
the
desires
which
the
god
of
evil
has
placed
in
all
flesh
he
shall
seek
out
the
myonessae
choose
one
and
cohabit
with
her
for
as
long
as
they
both
will
it
is
a
matter
of
free
choice
and
no
compulsion
yet
during
such
time
the
diaconal
is
not
allowed
to
continue
his
studies
thus
standing
in
danger
of
never
becoming
initiate
but
of
dying
and
being
reborn
into
some
ugly
form
as
a
serpent
or
an
said
lalette
nipping
a
lip
in
her
little
white
teeth
and
what
of
us
who
merely
satisfy
the
lusts
of
these
men
from
severity
the
mattern
s
face
turned
to
astonishment
why
this
is
the
very
service
of
love
that
we
offer
our
bodies
not
in
exchange
for
the
sustainment
a
man
gives
us
and
the
satisfaction
of
our
own
desires
but
in
the
name
of
the
love
of
god
that
all
may
benefit
by
learning
the
vanity
of
earthly
i
was
not
told
of
this
and
i
do
not
think
i
like
dame
quasso
s
face
turned
stern
again
very
well
she
said
in
an
iron
voice
there
are
some
who
will
not
accept
instruction
i
will
have
the
account
made
up
of
what
you
owe
for
the
passage
here
when
it
is
paid
you
may
have
a
porter
take
your
box
wherever
you
where
indeed
and
how
pay
panic
mingled
with
the
anger
that
boiled
anew
in
lalette
s
mind
ah
she
said
you
talk
of
love
and
holiness
then
burst
into
tears
leaning
forward
with
her
hands
covering
her
face
the
mattern
came
around
and
placed
a
surprisingly
gentle
hand
on
the
girl
s
shoulder
my
child
she
said
it
is
not
i
nor
the
initiates
of
mancherei
that
place
you
under
hard
compulsion
but
this
material
world
in
which
the
god
of
evil
has
all
power
all
you
have
learned
all
you
have
gained
through
witchery
is
straight
from
hell
return
to
your
room
meditate
what
i
have
said
until
supper
when
some
of
the
diaconals
will
come
and
see
for
yourself
whether
it
is
as
sour
a
fate
to
be
of
the
myonessae
as
you
now
ii
rodvard
had
no
meal
at
noon
lacking
money
his
eyeballs
ached
from
toiling
under
lamplight
and
the
others
had
finished
their
eating
when
he
reached
the
gualdis
shop
the
dame
s
voice
was
not
very
pleasant
the
blue
star
told
him
she
hoped
he
was
not
going
to
be
as
much
trouble
he
could
not
make
out
but
leece
and
vyana
the
oldest
daughter
reheated
for
him
some
of
the
stew
in
a
casserole
and
made
to
entertain
him
by
asking
him
about
his
work
when
he
told
them
it
was
casting
accounts
for
the
myonessae
there
was
something
behind
vyana
s
eyes
that
came
to
him
as
a
shapeless
whirl
of
fear
and
desire
but
he
could
neither
draw
her
thought
more
clear
nor
cause
the
subject
to
be
pursued
now
the
talk
turned
to
dossola
and
especially
to
count
cleudi
for
the
whole
family
became
much
excited
when
they
learned
rodvard
had
actually
seen
that
famous
person
in
the
flesh
and
even
worked
for
him
it
took
him
several
moments
to
realize
that
here
in
mancherei
he
need
not
withhold
his
tongue
for
these
people
thought
the
count
as
great
a
villain
as
did
the
sons
of
the
new
day
rodvard
related
the
trick
cleudi
had
played
on
aiella
of
arjen
keeping
his
own
name
out
of
it
for
a
reason
he
did
not
quite
know
whereupon
leece
asked
innocently
what
a
mistress
might
be
and
the
elders
laughed
his
own
room
was
very
small
with
the
window
right
over
the
bed
and
only
space
for
a
garderobe
a
cabinet
and
one
chair
the
next
morning
the
girl
brought
his
breakfast
very
early
and
it
needed
no
blue
star
to
see
that
she
wanted
to
talk
so
he
made
her
sit
on
the
chair
and
took
the
tray
across
his
knees
as
he
asked
why
vyana
had
been
so
strange
about
the
myonessae
the
night
before
her
sweetheart
is
a
learner
who
has
now
become
diaconal
and
wishes
to
join
the
sisterhood
but
father
and
mother
want
her
to
marry
in
the
usual
she
leaned
close
and
in
a
voice
that
was
little
above
a
whisper
said
you
won
t
tell
will
you
but
we
are
afraid
he
ll
bring
an
initiate
to
persuade
them
and
then
he
ll
find
out
that
father
and
mother
really
believe
in
the
old
religion
and
he
ll
send
both
of
them
away
for
instruction
and
all
three
of
us
will
have
to
go
into
the
myonessae
and
i
don
t
want
so
many
questions
whirled
in
rodvard
s
head
that
he
could
not
find
words
fast
enough
and
all
his
senses
were
tingling
with
the
sudden
nearness
of
leece
s
red
lips
the
swelling
breasts
and
the
message
that
darted
from
her
eyes
saying
she
was
pleased
with
this
same
nearness
but
not
as
damaris
the
maid
she
held
herself
high
and
he
said
rather
stupidly
not
thinking
of
his
words
and
why
not
i
would
she
leaned
back
again
the
eyes
went
dead
the
thick
brows
came
together
ah
but
you
do
not
think
like
a
woman
what
charming
leece
she
flashed
a
smile
which
accepted
his
tiny
apology
and
announced
they
two
would
play
the
game
so
set
in
motion
we
want
to
be
loved
for
ourselves
here
in
this
world
there
i
have
said
it
now
when
you
make
your
report
before
the
stylarion
you
have
only
to
complain
that
i
am
out
of
the
law
of
love
and
they
ll
send
me
somewhere
for
instruction
and
you
won
t
have
to
be
bothered
with
my
questions
about
defend
the
day
but
tell
me
leece
is
it
contrary
to
the
law
not
to
be
amorosian
oh
no
you
don
t
understand
it
isn
t
that
hard
really
only
the
initiates
have
to
see
that
people
don
t
do
wrong
things
and
doing
something
wrong
always
begins
with
thinking
so
they
send
people
away
for
instruction
when
they
begin
to
think
the
wrong
she
rattled
this
off
like
a
lesson
learned
rodvard
said
but
who
decides
whether
the
initiates
themselves
are
right
why
they
have
to
be
they
learn
everything
through
the
god
of
love
and
one
of
them
couldn
t
be
wrong
without
the
others
finding
it
out
that
was
how
they
found
out
that
the
prophet
was
falling
under
the
power
of
the
god
of
evil
when
he
tried
to
change
everything
and
had
to
leave
rodvard
picked
at
the
bedcover
for
a
moment
deciding
it
was
as
well
to
change
the
subject
but
tell
can
t
your
myonessae
be
loved
for
themselves
i
am
only
two
days
here
and
know
so
little
about
your
by
the
diaconals
who
choose
them
you
mean
ah
no
all
the
myonessae
know
they
are
only
second
choice
the
diaconals
have
already
chosen
the
service
of
the
god
of
love
then
the
myonessae
are
jealous
of
the
of
your
god
of
love
oh
no
women
think
more
spiritually
than
men
you
must
go
to
a
service
with
me
and
then
you
ll
the
corner
of
her
mouth
twitched
slightly
she
reached
over
to
touch
his
hand
i
must
go
she
said
and
was
gone
this
was
the
beginning
of
a
custom
by
which
she
came
to
him
each
morning
to
be
his
instructor
in
all
that
concerned
mancherei
once
or
twice
fat
dame
gualdis
wheezed
up
the
stair
and
smiled
through
the
door
at
the
two
wishing
them
good
morning
as
she
went
past
on
some
errand
real
or
pretended
she
seemed
to
find
it
decorous
that
the
girl
often
sat
on
the
edge
of
rodvard
s
bed
their
conversation
never
seemed
to
fail
and
they
took
delight
in
minor
contacts
as
when
he
showed
leece
the
fashion
of
sitting
wrestle
he
had
learned
as
a
lad
with
each
opponent
gripping
the
other
s
right
elbow
and
only
that
arm
engaged
leece
was
so
nearly
as
strong
as
himself
as
to
make
the
contest
a
true
one
and
she
was
as
greedy
as
he
of
the
of
bodies
as
the
blue
star
told
him
she
would
go
a
long
way
with
him
it
said
perhaps
all
the
way
if
pressed
but
felt
a
little
fearful
of
her
own
desires
and
would
want
him
as
a
husband
in
permanence
when
she
left
he
would
think
of
damaris
the
maid
as
he
dressed
and
how
she
also
had
sat
on
his
bed
and
the
end
of
that
meeting
sweet
and
terrifying
how
she
had
killed
his
blue
star
and
how
he
would
surely
have
been
trapped
into
some
regular
connection
with
her
had
not
circumstance
ordered
his
flight
from
sedad
vix
at
this
it
seemed
to
him
walking
the
street
to
his
daily
toil
that
there
was
nothing
in
the
world
so
precious
as
that
jewel
and
the
use
to
which
it
must
be
put
and
he
must
reach
dossola
again
and
by
no
means
do
the
thing
that
would
rob
the
blue
star
of
its
virtue
and
then
he
thought
of
the
penalty
lalette
had
promised
which
lay
at
the
back
of
his
mind
like
a
dark
cloud
of
dread
but
as
he
took
his
place
on
his
stool
the
thought
came
that
he
had
already
earned
whatever
penalty
there
was
it
was
not
credible
that
the
accident
of
having
the
star
s
power
restored
by
the
old
woman
in
the
hut
would
disannul
what
he
had
to
bear
nor
was
it
likely
that
the
restoration
would
hide
his
action
from
one
possessed
of
the
of
the
girl
to
whom
he
was
bound
but
why
was
he
bound
to
lalette
now
the
sweetness
of
the
touch
of
leece
and
the
desire
of
her
body
ran
through
him
like
a
liquid
fire
and
he
felt
as
though
he
were
running
across
a
bridge
no
wider
than
a
over
a
yawning
chasm
toward
a
goal
hidden
in
mist
and
all
his
inner
organs
were
wrung
bergelin
said
the
protostylarion
you
will
remember
that
this
work
is
given
to
you
as
a
charity
which
it
will
profit

not
to
inevitable
another
girl
was
already
before
the
mirror
in
the
running
a
comb
through
fair
hair
taller
than
lalette
she
looked
over
her
shoulder
at
the
newcomer
with
an
expression
not
unlike
that
of
a
satisfied
cat
and
went
on
with
her
task
humming
a
little
tune
lalette
felt
that
she
was
being
asked
to
speak
first
your
pardon
she
said
but
i
have
just
come
can
you
tell
me
where
the
soap
is
kept
the
tall
girl
surveyed

we
use

of
mine

oh
thank
you
i
didn
t
mean
my
name
is
lalette
again
the
hesitation
a
momentary
question
whether
to
say
bergelin
here
but
that
was
all
dead
and
gone
she
would
never
see
him
again
my
name
is
nanhilde
we
don
t
use
second
names
in
the
myonessae
unless
we
have
been
married
have
you
ever
oh
you
must
get
rid
of
prejudices
in
a
place
like
this
i
used
to
think
that
being
married
was
something
i
wanted
so
much
but
it
isn
t
really
it
only
chains
you
to
some
man
and
next
thing
you
know
you
re
sewing
jackets
and
raising
brats
for
him
you
wait
till
you
re
chosen
he
ll
want
to
marry
you
and
give
up

an
initiate

always
do
and
if

more

lalette
had
been
washing
her
face
now
she
lifted
it
from
the
towel
in
time
to
catch
the
middle
term
of
the
series
but
are
we
of
the
myonessae
prevented
from
having
children
then
you
are
a
greenie
aren
t
you
of
course
not

have
to
snivel
around

his
miniature

and
i

show
it

you

with
your
dress
and
we
ll
go
down
together
old
doesn
t
like
anybody
to
be
she
took
lalette
s
arm
and
guided
her
along
a
hall
already
with
dusk
to
the
stairwell
where
the
racking
note
of
a
violin
floated
in
a
funnel
of
light
below
it
was
all
so
different
than
lalette
had
seen
it
in
the
morning
or
even
at
noon
when
she
had
eaten
a
rather
gloomy
meal
of
pulse
and
one
apple
while
the
others
around
her
chattered
in
a
subdued
manner
under
the
eye
of
dame
quasso
the
whole
place
was
now
gay
with
lamps
and
someone
had
hung
spring
branches
among
them
under
which
girls
were
gathered
in
excited
little
groups
some
of
them
talking
to
young
men
the
ruffles
of
their
dresses
vibrating
as
though
they
too
had
caught
the
mood
of
animation
among
the
moving
heads
lalette
could
see
how
the
double
doors
of
the
were
flung
wide
at
its
entry
the
mattern
stood
talking
with
a
man
dressed
in
grey
whose
expression
never
changed
dame
quasso
beckoned
as
lalette
worked
her
way
in
that
direction
a
voice
floated
past
i
told
her
he
already
said
he
would
choose
me
and
i
don
t
care
if
i
do
lose
my
place
i
m
going
to
ask
for
an
initiate
s
trial
the
eyes
looked
down
into
hers
from
a
height
this
is
our
newest
member
called
lalette
said
the
mattern
she
is
from
dossola
where
she
was
accused
of
witchery
and
she
is
somewhat
troubled
in
a
long
gaze
the
grey
man
said
it
is
because
she
feels
compelled
and
has
not
learned
the
wonderful
freedom
of
the
service
of
the
god
of
love
my
child
witches
find
it
harder
than
anyone
else
to
forget
the
material
self
but
once
they
do
so
attain
the
most
surely
to
perfection
lalette
wanted
to
cry
that
it
was
no
desire
of
hers
she
said
the
material
self
i
don
t
really
care
what
i
where
i
the
grey
man
said
do
not
think
in
mere
terms
of
nourishment
which
is
a
means
of
maintaining
the
material
body
we
despise
in
love
we
serve
the
lalette
felt
her
inner
gorge
rising
toward
forbidden
anger
i
am
not
sure
i
do
not
be
troubled
many
fail
to
understand
in
the
beginning
and
to
many
perfection
comes
after
a
long
struggle
in
the
rebecks
and
flutes
broke
out
all
in
tune
dame
quasso
offered
her
arm
to
the
grey
man
and
lalette
looked
around
to
see
other
pairings
two
and
two
moving
into
the
she
herself
was
suddenly
left
unattended
to
go
in
with
the
blonde
nanhilde
the
taller
girl
leaned
close
and
said
what
do
you
mean
said
lalette
nobody
not
an
obula
tonight
replied
nanhilde
ii
listen
said
leece
oh
hear
i
am
not
ignorant
if
you
really
desire
that
i
should
come
no
more
i
will
not
i
am
not
one
to
lovely
leece
he
said
it
is
for
you
not
i
yet
knowing
it
was
for
himself
and
drew
her
hand
to
his
lips
folding
her
fingers
round
the
kiss
he
placed
in
the
palm
she
looked
at
him
intently
there
is
a
cold
breeze
she
said
and
stepping
to
the
door
closed
it
before
she
ran
across
the
room
with
little
quick
steps
to
throw
back
the
covers
and
slip
in
beside
him
the
black
brows
brushed
his
cheek
if
you
hated
me
and
really
wanted
to
get
rid
of
me
let
me
ask
you
what
would
you
do
how
different
would
you
behave
toward
me
than
you
are
now
doing
you
tell
me
that
talking
with
you
here
in
the
morning
gives
you
pleasure
and
is
a
help
to
you
why
do
you
wish
to
stop
it
then
if
i
am
willing
to
come
and
if
you
are
thinking
of
any
danger
to
me
why
surely
that
is
my
as
her
arm
came
around
his
neck
and
their
lips
met
in
the
long
deep
kiss
he
closed
his
eyes
not
daring
to
look
into
hers
for
this
was
no
damaris
the
maid
and
it
was
not
that
he
dared
not
but
that
he
would
not
they
came
shuddering
from
the
contact
ah
no
he
cried
and
drew
her
close
again
and
for
a
third
time
but
then
she
said
suddenly
three
is
enough
and
without
another
word
slipped
from
beside
him
and
was
gone
all
nights
were
now
turned
into
a
prelude
to
the
mornings
and
all
days
to
a
prelude
for
the
evenings
when
one
of
the
other
sisters
would
talk
with
them
and
gently
jest
at
them
for
a
pair
of
lovers
until
rodvard
and
leece
went
out
for
a
stroll
under
avenues
of
where
lights
flickered
through
the
leaves
in
the
warm
summer
air
the
elder
vyana
or
the
younger
madaille
often
accompanied
them
on
these
journeys
laughing
a
great
deal
as
they
conversed
on
matters
of
no
importance
for
it
was
as
though
he
and
leece
had
signed
a
treaty
never
to
show
anyone
outside
how
deeply
they
were
concerned
with
each
other
in
the
mornings
when
the
subject
turned
to
themselves
there
were
checks
and
uncertainties
in
their
words
yet
it
was
a
topic
they
could
not
avoid
rodvard
would
often
leave
his
breakfast
uneaten
the
better
to
lie
beside
her
kissing
and
kissing
with
now
and
then
some
little
thing
said
you
must
not
love
me
she
whispered
one
morning
turning
her
burning
face
from
his
not
in
the
human
why
not
leece
i
and
kissed
her
again
ah
so
do
i
but
to
love
to
would
be
falling
into
the
hands
of
the
evil
god
for
me
to
love
you
or
you
to
love
me
before
you
had
been
to
instruction
and
accepted
the
doctrine
of
the
prophet
do
you
understand
he
did
not
nor
when
he
broke
the
rule
he
had
set
on
himself
and
looked
into
her
eyes
could
he
read
behind
them
any
illumination
i
am
not
sure
i
want
to
be
an
amorosian
he
said
gravely
but
if
you
say
i
shall
not
love
you
i
will
try
not
to
she
hugged
him
close
then
and
her
lips
sought
his
to
end
this
and
to
say
without
words
that
this
commerce
of
theirs
was
a
pleasure
for
its
own
sake
and
might
be
brought
to
destruction
by
any
talk
of
a
deeper
so
he
reasoned
out
her
action
that
night
as
he
lay
in
the
hour
between
waking
and
sleep
the
pleasure
of
it
was
so
sweet
that
he
dared
do
nothing
to
change
the
pattern
though
when
she
tried
to
tell
him
of
the
strange
religion
of
the
prophet
he
would
change
the
conversation
to
the
mystery
of
their
mutual
the
midst
of
which
a
vertigo
of
kissing
and
clasping
would
come
upon
them
and
there
would
be
silence
for
a
long
time
the
door
was
always
closed
now
sometimes
the
footsteps
of
dame
gualdis
could
be
heard
outside
but
after
the
first
time
when
leece
slipped
from
the
bed
in
panic
they
paid
no
attention
for
the
mother
neither
knocked
nor
entered
only
when
the
steps
sounded
leece
would
gently
hold
his
hand
to
make
him
cease
fondling
her
breasts
which
she
now
allowed
him
freely
to
do
at
all
times
lying
with
dark
lashes
on
her
cheek
and
lips
half
parted
she
would
not
let
him
go
further
than
this
nor
did
the
cold
blue
star
speak
of
any
willingness
to
do
so
when
once
with
senses
reeling
he
would
have
pressed
the
matter
on
she
said
no
someone
might
come
there
was
no
time
and
made
other
excuses
though
she
kissed
him
as
she
said
it
and
caressed
him
with
curious
fingers
yet
it
had
become
part
of
an
unspoken
agreement
between
them
that
he
should
ask
for
no
more
only
kiss
her
and
be
as
bold
as
she
permitted
and
it
was
she
who
ultimately
brought
the
matter
into
words
if
we
were
married
you
could
have
me
whenever
you
she
said
it
half
regretfully
and
he
did
look
this
time
catching
behind
her
eyes
something
like
a
color
something
that
spoke
of
a
desire
in
her
though
somehow
not
of
the
same
kind
as
his
own
by
the
convention
into
which
they
had
fallen
he
must
now
clasp
her
eagerly
and
say
ah
leece
and
kiss
her
for
a
long
time
before
saying
yet
if
we
did
marry
and
the
mixture
proved
imperfect
consider
how
we
might
hate
each
i
like
to
kiss
you
she
said
simply
vyana
cried
last
night
she
saw
him
in
the
afternoon
and
does
not
know
what
to
feel
my
heart
beat
he
said
placing
her
hand
over
it
it
would
seem
to
me
that
she
and
her
lover
are
really
meant
for
a
perfect
union
could
she
not
enter
the
myonessae
and
be
chosen
and
persuade
him
to
marriage
afterward
the
girl
went
stiff
in
his
arms
looking
at
him
with
eyes
wide
in
astonishment
why
she
cried
that
would
be
deception
and
him
from
the
service
of
the
god
of
love
to
evil
oh
rodvard
never
say
such
there
was
a
true
trembling
in
her
voice
and
he
felt
the
moisture
of
a
tear
where
her
face
was
pressed
into
the
crotch
of
his
neck
it
did
not
seem
to
him
that
a
chance
remark
was
a
matter
for
such
fervor
for
as
he
knew
religion
it
was
a
guide
and
the
world
would
go
mad
if
one
tried
to
observe
its
commands
in
every
particular
but
all
this
was
only
the
background
of
a
flicker
of
surprise
across
his
mind
as
he
left
her
face
and
kissed
her
closed
eyes
leece
leece
he
said
i
didn
t
and
did
not
know
what
more
to
say
oh
rodvard
i
could
not
bear
it
if
you
deceived
me
like
do
you
think
i
am
trying
to
kiss
i
do
not
know
no
ah
we
must
not
do
this
it
leads
us
into
the
hands
of
evil
rodvard
rodvard
you
must
if
you
want
me
the
word
died
into
lips
moving
without
sound
on
which
his
lips
closed
her
breath
began
to
come
fast
she
let
his
seeking
fingers
linger
a
moment
at
her
breasts
and
slide
past
he
could
not
see
her
eyes
but
without
the
intervention
of
his
amulet
he
knew
that
this
was
the
at
the
very
point
of
sliding
from
the
crest
leece
flung
herself
gasping
from
his
arms
and
with
a
sob
was
gone
next
morning
his
breakfast
was
left
outside
the
door
iii
the
linen
stitching
was
very
tedious
five
or
six
of
them
all
novices
like
herself
sat
in
a
circle
and
went
round
the
edges
of
napkins
drawing
three
threads
stitching
them
home
drawing
three
threads
bringing
them
home
again
while
the
mattern
or
mircella
or
one
of
the
older
girls
read
slowly
from
the
first
book
of
the
prophet
pausing
now
and
again
to
make
exposition
of
the
meaning
of
a
passage
talking
was
discouraged
at
noon
there
was
always
the
same
meal
of
pulse
with
fresh
greens
or
fruit
but
in
the
evening
sometimes
a
piece
of
meat
every
they
all
marched
in
procession
to
the
house
of
religion
and
there
was
a
service
not
like
those
in
the
dossolan
churches
with
their
flowers
and
music
but
merely
a
discourse
such
as
lalette
had
first
heard
at
the
conventicle
in
netznegon
with
everybody
embracing
each
other
afterward
and
prayers
of
grace
pronounced
by
an
initiate
this
took
place
at
noon
after
the
service
no
more
work
was
done
on
these
days
after
dinner
and
on
the
free
afternoons
all
were
at
liberty
except
for
such
matters
as
personal
laundry
most
of
the
girls
walked
two
and
two
for
a
while
in
the
garden
where
tall
alleys
of
hollyhocks
divided
the
vegetable
plots
on
which
some
of
the
myonessae
labored
during
the
day
going
on
out
into
the
street
was
not
forbidden
but
not
encouraged
lalette
quickly
it
very
pleasant
for
although
these
people
of
mancherei
had
no
badges
of
status
which
at
first
seemed
a
very
strange
thing
everybody
seemed
to
know
at
once
that
she
was
one
of
the
sisterhood
this
was
all
right
as
to
older
people
but
in
the
young
men
would
call
out
to
her
or
what
was
worse
sidle
alongside
her
on
the
pave
and
try
to
make
conversation
or
offer
a
glass
of
wine
she
found
their
insinuation
so
infuriating
that
the
second
time
this
happened
with
the
fellow
almost
directly
making
an
insinuation
only
the
memory
of
tegval
kept
her
from
putting
a
witchery
on
him
then
and
there
dame
quasso
had
been
walking
in
the
garden
that
night
as
lalette
came
hurrying
through
the
gate
she
looked
so
long
and
intently
that
it
seemed
she
must
somehow
have
caught
part
of
the
initiates
trick
of
and
to
lalette
s
other
troubles
was
added
the
fear
of
being
known
for
a
murderess
on
this
night
of
all
the
blonde
nanhilde
would
choose
to
come
to
her
room
for
a
talk
babbling
against
the
clerks
of
account
who
had
allowed
her
far
less
than
she
deserved
for
some
broideries
she
had
done
they
gave
zina
just
double
my
price
i
know
what
it
is
she
slips
out
of
here
on
and
gets
drunk
with
some
of
those
clerks
and
lets
them
do
anything
they
want
she
s
lalette
upset
and
wanting
to
talk
about
anything
but
this
but
how
can
she
keep
the
mattern
from
knowing
about
it
oh
she
is
careful
a
girl
has
to
be
in
this
place
she
always
gets
back
before
bedtime
and
her
sister
in
town
says
she
spends
the
afternoons
lalette
sighed
i
thought
when
i
came
nanhilde
said
what
did
you
expect
to
be
different
lalette
s
hands
fluttered
is
there
no
way
we
can
escape
from
the
overwhelming
lusts
of
men
a
girl
in
the
myonessae
can
do
very
well
if
she
does
not
fear
lalette
burst
into
tears
midwinter
the
return
make
up
this
account
for
closing
said
the
protostylarion
handing
rodvard
a
dossier
which
bore
the
endorsement
approved
to
expel
the
subject
from
the
myonessae
for
contumacious
refusal
to
accept
any
rodvard
dragged
weary
feet
to
the
bench
for
his
night
had
been
sleepless
with
this
matter
of
leece
reaching
a
crisis
all
week
she
had
striven
to
pretend
in
the
presence
of
others
that
nothing
was
changed
but
would
neither
bring
his
breakfast
nor
allow
him
any
opportunity
to
speak
with
her
alone
in
the
evening
a
sleepless
night
began
when
he
had
refused
to
walk
with
her
and
vyana
under
planes
still
clinging
to
their
last
leaves
then
felt
unhappy
over
the
look
of
a
friend
betrayed
that
came
into
her
eyes
a
crisis
for
that
look
was
a
trap
as
grim
as
the
one
the
witch
had
set
for
him
he
did
not
really
want
the
leece
he
told
himself
overall
at
the
price
of
permanent
union
she
set
upon
her
body
it
would
have
been
it
was
enough
merely
to
talk
with
her
and
be
gay
companions
as
he
was
with
the
other
sisters
only
the
moments
when
a
contact
of
lips
or
body
sent
a
devouring
flame
along
his
veins
were
different
yet
there
was
now
upon
him
a
compulsion
to
find
the
next
move
in
the
game
and
carry
it
through
as
though
he
were
involved
in
a
complex
dance
and
dared
not
miss
a
pace
what
is
this
then
he
asked
himself
am
i
a
mechanician
s
instrument
or
so
weak
i
am
not
my
own
master
is
it
that
i
owe
her
a
duty
and
by
what
sanction
am
i
held
thereto
the
priest
at
the
academy
might
have
had
an
answer
for
that
he
would
have
said
that
the
sanction
was
of
god
who
sends
us
all
peace
so
that
even
those
misguided
men
who
say
there
is
no
god
must
make
an
inner
peace
through
a
claim
to
be
true
to
some
image
of
the
ideal
which
they
call
themselves
so
that
god
is
not
balked
but
enters
in
them
unawares
and
they
only
make
their
own
path
harder
by
reaching
him
through
devious
ways
instead
of
he
could
remember
the
argument
accurately
and
how
its
force
had
once
struck
him
thus
the
priest
then
but
if
the
sanction
was
of
god
did
god
rodvard
now
asked
himself
urge
him
to
this
pursuit
of
leece
no
matter
what
he
knew
that
when
he
reached
the
gualdis
house
that
night
the
intricate
pavanne
would
continue
and
he
a
part
of
it
as
before
leave
then
no
not
in
this
land
where
he
was
a
public
prisoner
required
still
to
report
on
every
tenth
day
an
irritating
routine
for
that
matter
leave
for
where
not
dossola
with
the
prosecution
hanging
over
his
head
not
any
other
place
dance
out
the
dance
the
protostylarion
s
step
roused
him
from
reverie
he
opened
the
dossier
and
with
a
feeling
of
vertigo
perceived
that
it
was
from
the
couvertine
lolau
the
account
of
the
myonessan
lalette
ii
without
a
knock
the
door
opened
leece
slipped
in
and
stood
with
her
back
to
it
looking
down
rodvard
began
hastily
to
make
good
his
it
was
my
fault
she
said
in
a
thin
voice
then
hurriedly
what
i
did
was
contrary
to
the
law
of
love
do
you
want
me
to
bring
your
breakfast
in
the
morning
her
eyes
were
veiled
but
one
could
guess
what
lay
behind
them
and
one
must
tread
the
right
measure
you
are
still
angry
with
he
ran
across
the
room
and
seized
her
in
his
arms
so
she
let
her
dark
head
slide
down
against
his
neck
what
can
i
say
kissing
her
ear
and
the
side
of
her
neck
yet
at
the
same
time
feeling
a
revulsion
almost
physical
and
all
the
time
the
thought
of
that
other
was
at
the
back
of
his
mind
not
coming
forward
because
he
dared
not
let
it
a
sudden
tenseness
was
in
her
grip
she
flung
her
head
back
and
looked
at
him
out
of
eyes
that
spoke
distrust
rodvard
what
is
wrong
nothing
we
must
hurry
and
go
to
supper
or
they
will
miss
a
rivulet
of
perspiration
coursed
down
his
spine
she
kissed
him
long
and
hard
with
the
doubt
still
there
and
was
gone
afterward
it
was
the
tall
vyana
who
went
to
walk
with
them
leece
took
his
hand
all
gay
but
casting
glances
that
seemed
to
show
an
unasked
question
in
her
mind
so
that
rodvard
wondered
whether
she
might
not
have
some
part
of
the
blue
star
s
gift
he
said
to
vyana
tell
me
something
if
you
were
in
the
myonessae
how
could
i
come
to
see
you
her
face
fell
sober
i
am
not
a
myonessan
yet
but
if
i
were
it
would
not
be
easy
unless
you
became
at
least
a
learner
the
myonessans
have
no
contacts
with
the
outer
world
save
those
they
make
a
strange
rule
he
said
not
daring
to
push
the
matter
further
lest
he
betray
his
thought
now
leece
spoke
trying
to
justify
the
regimen
under
which
the
girls
lived
but
vyana
being
so
near
to
the
sisterhood
was
doubtful
and
rodvard
heard
both
of
them
with
only
part
of
his
mind
considering
what
he
must
do
there
was
no
question
but
he
must
do
it
ah
no
the
expelled
of
the
myonessae
he
knew
well
were
shut
away
in
gloomy
prisons
for
instruction
it
might
be
for
years
the
couvertine
lolau
you
not
think
so
rodvard
said
leece
s
voice
i
am
sorry
i
was
thinking
of
a
all
her
attention
and
affection
suddenly
rushed
at
him
she
pressed
his
hand
hard
i
was
only
and
in
spite
of
that
warm
grip
his
mind
went
off
again
under
the
babble
the
blue
star
would
perhaps
let
him
make
his
way
in
if
the
light
were
they
reached
the
door
leece
squeezed
his
hand
again
possessively
he
knew
she
would
have
sought
a
corner
and
kissed
him
but
he
managed
to
avoid
that
with
a
certain
shame
picking
at
him
inside
he
went
rapidly
upstairs
then
stood
tingling
in
his
own
room
as
outer
steps
went
to
and
fro
his
mind
toiled
at
lock
of
the
was
a
heavy
one
usually
turning
with
a
grating
sound
he
must
have
a
story
ready
to
tell
if
someone
woke
and
asked
him
questions
but
before
he
could
work
out
a
tale
the
small
sounds
died
to
a
single
series
of
pat
pat
pat
and
he
had
a
moment
of
dreadful
fear
and
excitement
mingled
that
it
might
be
leece
coming
to
him
that
night
this
was
his
in
life
he
thought
and
the
choice
was
being
made
from
outside
himself
the
steps
went
past
rodvard
released
his
breath
sat
down
and
trying
to
use
up
the
time
until
all
should
be
asleep
began
to
repeat
to
himself
iren
dostal
s
ballad
of
the
archer
and
the
bear
but
at
the
third
stanza
a
rhyme
somehow
eluded
him
and
he
nearly
went
mad
trying
to
recall
it
while
at
the
same
time
the
other
half
of
his
mind
went
round
the
problem
of
without
once
making
a
real
effort
toward
the
plan
he
must
have
then
he
tried
to
solve
how
the
line
of
duty
might
be
considered
to
lie
according
to
one
or
another
system
of
philosophy
but
all
this
yielded
was
the
unsatisfactory
conclusion
that
he
did
not
know
where
duty
or
even
true
desire
lay
only
what
he
was
going
to
do
now
he
began
to
count
boards
in
the
floor
as
he
had
counted
the
of
the
ship
merely
to
pass
time
and
time
passed
he
cracked
the
door
ajar
heard
someone
snore
and
reached
the
odd
thought
that
even
the
loveliest
of
girls
sometimes
snore
tip
tap
and
he
was
down
the
hall
to
the
stairs
a
board
creaked
there
he
paused
the
key
grated
even
more
harshly
than
he
had
anticipated
and
again
he
stood
breathless
a
minute
then
was
in
the
street
a
sense
of
freedom
swelled
through
him
as
he
looked
up
at
the
winter
must
be
the
right
line
the
glorious
line
hurrah
even
though
the
adventure
failed
a
silent
street
down
which
advanced
in
the
near
distance
a
cloaked
couple
picking
their
way
along
with
a
before
the
checkered
gleams
from
the
window
of
his
lantern
caught
the
and
from
the
dull
surfaces
seemed
like
weary
fireflies
a
caleche
went
past
its
form
dimly
outlined
against
the
darker
shadows
beneath
the
branches
step
on
rodvard
the
way
is
here
he
stumbled
in
the
dark
over
the
edge
of
a
cobble
turned
a
corner
and
another
wondering
how
the
glass
stood
and
reached
the
couvertine
lolau
at
last
he
remembered
it
as
the
building
he
had
passed
on
his
first
day
in
charalkis
with
a
foreyard
in
which
a
dead
tree
stood
the
held
no
porter
its
window
was
broken
rodvard
this
is
somehow
the
model
of
the
myonessae
if
i
could
trace
the
resemblance
as
his
feet
clicked
on
the
pave
up
to
the
door
where
one
light
burned
behind
a
transom
in
a
fan
of
glass
summing
his
force
he
knocked
no
answer
he
knocked
again
far
in
the
interior
a
step
sounded
coming
the
door
was
thrown
back
to
show
a
fat
beldame
with
a
robe
gathered
round
her
whose
hand
trembled
slightly
with
palsy
what
is
it
she
said
the
light
was
above
and
behind
her
he
could
not
see
her
eyes
to
use
his
jewel
i
am
from
the
office
of
account
he
said
depending
upon
sudden
inspiration
in
the
matter
of
the
demoiselle
a
poor
hour
to
be
coming
she
grumbled
ay
ay
the
lalette
i
will
call
the
mattern
they
will
take
her
in
the
she
moved
aside
to
let
him
enter
and
as
she
did
so
the
light
caught
her
face
his
glance
quickened
by
emergency
caught
in
those
muddy
eyes
a
green
flash
of
mingled
hate
and
greed
wait
he
said
and
touched
her
wrist
perhaps
it
is
not
needed
to
rouse
that
he
could
use
it
what
do
you
mean
it
is
a
simple
matter
not
official
he
fumbled
out
a
coin
or
two
and
pressed
them
in
her
hand
the
fat
face
moved
into
a
leer
eh
eh
so
that
s
the
story
want
to
take
her
do
you
and
poor
mircella
will
be
blamed
maybe
sent
for
instruction
it
should
be
worth
money
again
he
experienced
a
moment
of
panic
i
am
from
the
office
of
account
he
repeated
i
am
to
take
her
there
to
close
her
reckoning
you
will
have
the
perquisite
of
her
he
he
and
you
the
best
perquisite
it
should
be
worth
sh
someone
will
hear
he
found
another
pair
of
coins
this
is
not
give
back
the
rest
and
call
your
he
turned
she
clutched
his
arm
grumbling
in
her
throat
and
he
could
see
she
did
not
believe
him
in
the
least
but
would
be
satisfied
if
given
a
story
to
tell
come
another
through
a
silent
house
this
time
upward
the
place
had
the
indefinable
perfume
of
many
women
the
guide
shuffled
along
in
a
dark
almost
complete
rodvard
heard
the
chink
of
keys
then
a
tick
against
the
lock
and
the
door
opened
strike
a
rodvard
felt
a
candle
pressed
into
his
hand
being
forced
to
give
his
attention
to
it
lalette
saw
him
first
when
the
light
flared
he
heard
her
gasp
and
looked
past
the
little
flame
to
see
her
standing
with
disheveled
hair
so
lovely
beyond
the
imagined
picture
that
he
could
not
resist
running
across
the
room
to
kiss
her
astonished
lips
she
must
have
been
sitting
fully
dressed
in
the
dark
rodvard
how
did
you
come
here
the
fat
woman
shuffled
in
the
background
and
he
no
matter
now
it
can
wait
we
must
go
she
stared
at
him
like
a
sleepwalker
where
there
were
no
more
words
between
them
at
this
time
or
place
lalette
turned
in
the
feeble
light
to
make
a
package
but
the
fat
woman
said
nah
my
perquisite
so
she
only
snatched
a
cloak
the
beldame
addressed
rodvard
now
you
use
your
knife
on
the
lock
to
show
where
it
was
picked
then
leave
it
then
they
know
my
story
is
true
a
man
was
he
hacked
at
the
brass
plate
that
held
the
keyhole
for
a
moment
and
fortune
favored
by
letting
one
of
the
screws
come
loose
with
a
snap
and
the
fat
woman
clawed
his
arm
to
indicate
that
was
enough
she
led
the
way
down
the
stair
rodvard
could
see
no
eyes
and
he
and
lalette
were
suddenly
out
the
door
iii
she
turned
to
face
him
under
the
dead
tree
you
do
not
want
me
any
more
how
did
you
find
me
where
did
you
come
from
he
thought
out
of
one
of
compulsions
and
into
another
i
do
want
you
or
i
would
not
have
come
i
could
not
help
it
did
you
not
receive
my
letter
i
suppose
you
have
some
story
to
cover
your
utter
i
swear
i
left
with
remigorius
a
letter
for
you
telling
how
i
was
called
to
sedad
vix
on
the
most
urgent
of
affairs
and
then
things
happened
i
will
tell
then
it
is
true
you
are
one
of
the
sons
of
the
new
the
eyes
were
hidden
but
the
tone
told
clearly
how
deep
was
her
anger
and
despair
i
have
come
for
you
he
said
simply
she
uttered
a
bitter
little
laugh
it
is
somewhat
late
my
friend
i
am
one
of
the
licensed
whores
they
call
myonessae
and
now
an
attainted
i
so
am
i
for
bringing
you
from
she
took
three
steps
in
silence
where
are
you
taking
me
a
he
had
not
thought
this
was
part
of
the
plan
he
had
been
too
excited
to
make
do
you
lodge
in
it
the
voice
was
so
small
that
he
knew
something
lay
behind
the
words
i
have
been
working
in
the
office
of
account
and
learned
of
your
trouble
there
he
said
inconsecutively
she
turned
toward
him
in
the
dark
street
where
far
down
someone
walked
with
a
light
the
hand
on
his
arm
trembling
a
little
oh
would
have
put
me
in
that
prison
for
instruction
and
then
turned
me
into
the
street
without
an
i
know
is
what
we
are
looking
an
inn
it
was
a
palpable
inn
beyond
the
corner
with
light
streaming
from
its
windows
they
entered
through
the
where
a
table
of
men
with
mugs
before
them
all
turned
their
heads
like
sunflowers
one
of
them
whispered
behind
a
hand
and
there
was
a
snicker
a
lugubrious
person
in
a
dirty
apron
came
to
the
inner
door
and
said
yah
he
would
give
them
welcome
for
the
night
supper
no
said
they
both
and
a
small
girl
with
her
hair
in
tight
braids
showed
them
to
a
room
where
there
was
only
one
chair
and
a
bed
where
they
would
sleep
together
for
the
first
time
since
the
night
in
dame
domijaiek
s
room
now
in
a
far
country
and
long
ago
rodvard
thought
she
is
wearing
her
hair
down
as
an
unwedded
girl
and
that
is
why
they
snickered
she
sat
on
the
edge
of
the
bed
tossing
her
head
back
rodvard
she
said
you
have
been
unfaithful
to
no
he
answered
in
reaction
merely
and
the
thought
that
crossed
his
mind
was
not
of
the
maid
damaris
but
of
leece
now
perhaps
herself
sleepless
and
waiting
for
the
dawn
your
blue
star
is
still
she
did
not
move
only
crossed
her
eyes
in
a
spasm
of
pain
i
think
perhaps
it
was
another
witch
i
know
one
put
a
spell
on
you
did
you
know
i
saved
you
from
it
you
can
go
to
her
if
you
wish
even
take
the
blue
star
i
do
not
want
it
any
lalette
do
not
talk
he
stepped
to
her
on
the
bed
slipped
his
arm
under
both
hers
where
she
supported
herself
leaning
backward
and
drove
her
down
his
lips
seeking
hers
she
met
him
passively
neither
giving
nor
avoiding
lalette
he
breathed
again
now
she
twisted
in
his
arms
ah
men
think
there
is
only
one
way
to
resolve
every
problem
with
a
girl
it
was
that
i
wished
to
get
away
from
i
will
go
he
released
her
then
and
lay
beside
her
unspeaking
for
a
moment
then
and
be
sent
for
instruction
and
then
turned
out
it
was
that
i
came
to
save
you
oh
i
am
grateful
i
will
not
go
back
then
and
you
can
have
what
you
have
there
was
a
torture
in
it
that
he
should
at
this
moment
think
of
maritzl
of
stojenrosek
he
to
his
feet
and
began
to
pace
the
floor
lalette
he
said
truly
you
do
not
understand
we
are
in
real
danger
both
of
us
and
can
not
afford
bitterness
i
have
not
been
in
this
country
long
enough
to
know
its
laws
but
i
know
we
have
broken
more
than
one
and
they
are
very
intent
after
both
of
us
you
as
a
witch
and
me
with
the
blue
star
even
though
they
say
witchery
is
not
forbidden
here
now
i
ask
your
true
help
as
i
have
helped
ah
my
friend
of
course
what
would
you
have
me
do
she
sat
up
suddenly
with
a
tear
in
the
corner
of
her
eye
which
he
affected
not
to
notice
all
kindliness
and
they
began
to
talk
not
of
their
present
emergency
but
of
their
adventures
and
how
strangely
they
were
met
there
he
gave
her
a
fair
tale
on
almost
all
except
about
damaris
and
leece
she
interrupted
now
and
again
as
something
he
said
reminded
her
of
one
detail
or
another
so
that
neither
of
them
even
thought
of
sleeping
until
the
candle
burning
down
and
a
pale
window
spoke
of
approaching
day
but
where
our
line
lies
now
i
do
not
know
he
concluded
inconsequentially
she
said
tell
me
truly
rodvard
about
the
sons
of
the
new
her
face
was
toward
him
as
she
spoke
he
was
astonished
to
catch
in
her
eye
a
complex
thought
something
about
feeling
herself
no
better
than
the
group
she
considered
thieves
and
murderers
well
then
we
are
not
murderers
and
steal
from
none
he
said
as
she
remembering
the
power
of
the
jewel
lowered
her
head
for
she
had
not
told
him
of
the
fate
of
tegval
we
are
only
trying
to
make
a
better
world
where
badges
of
condition
are
no
more
needed
than
here
in
mancherei
and
men
and
women
too
do
not
obtain
their
possessions
by
being
born
into
that
is
a
strange
thing
to
say
to
one
who
was
born
into
a
she
said
but
no
matter
now
what
shall
we
do
i
doubt
if
we
can
reach
the
inner
border
before
they
set
the
guards
after
us
and
with
the
case
of
this
captain
against
you
you
can
not
now
return
to
dossola
or
can
you
we
might
get
a
ship
that
would
take
us
to
the
green
islands
i
have
a
brother
there
who
s
to
pay
the
passage
for
i
have
little
money
much
of
my
gain
has
been
withheld
to
pay
for
the
things
i
needed
when
i
and
i
no
money
at
all
but
did
you
come
here
from
dossola
by
paying
can
we
not
offer
service
he
thought
of
the
captain
and
the
service
demanded
then
but
took
her
hand
you
are
right
and
it
is
the
only
thing
to
try
he
said
come
before
any
pursuit
fairly
they
crept
down
the
stairs
hand
in
hand
like
conspirators
at
the
parlor
rodvard
sacrificed
one
of
his
coins
to
pay
for
his
night
s
lodging
the
thought
of
leece
and
what
she
would
be
doing
at
this
hour
was
in
his
mind
as
they
stepped
into
a
street
from
which
the
grey
light
had
rubbed
out
all
the
night
s
romance
to
leave
the
city
drab
and
wintry
a
met
them
with
his
goats
and
gave
a
swirl
of
his
pipes
in
greeting
there
were
few
other
passengers
abroad
but
more
began
to
appear
as
they
drew
near
the
harbor
area
carters
and
busy
men
and
presently
they
were
among
warehouses
and
places
of
commerce
beyond
lay
the
quays
and
a
tangle
of
masts
here
was
a
tavern
opening
for
the
day
the
proprietor
said
that
a
captain
zenog
had
a
ship
at
the
fourth
dock
down
due
to
sail
for
the
green
isles
with
the
tide
the
place
was
not
hard
to
find
nor
the
captain
either
standing
by
the
board
of
his
vessel
strong
and
squat
like
a
giant
beaten
into
lesser
stature
by
the
mallet
of
one
still
stronger
a
green
islands
captain
aye
i
am
that
he
said
i
ll
take
you
there
on
the
smoothest
ship
that
sails
the
said
rodvard
i
do
not
doubt
it
but
we
have
no
money
and
wish
to
work
our
bluff
heartiness
fell
away
from
him
and
the
glance
said
he
was
suspicious
of
something
what
can
you
do
i
am
a
clerical
really
but
would
take
other
labor
merely
to
reach
the
green
lalette
said
i
have
done
sewing
and
could
mend
a
sail
here
and
the
captain
rubbed
a
chin
peppered
with
beard
a
clerical
i
could
use
fair
enough
one
that
could
cast
he
looked
around
most
of
you
amorosians
rodvard
said
joyously
i
am
not
of
mancherei
but
dossolan
educated
there
and
can
cast
up
an
account
as
there
d
be
no
pay
in
it
the
voyage
merely
said
the
man
quickly
we
will
do
it
for
that
said
rodvard
and
touched
captain
zenog
s
hand
in
acceptance
the
squat
man
turned
ohé
he
shouted
hinze
take
these
two
to
the
port
office
and
get
them
cleared
for
a
voyage
with
the
law
of
love
for
a
moment
after
the
man
had
spoken
rodvard
felt
as
though
he
were
falling
he
looked
at
lalette
and
saw
the
same
black
fear
was
in
her
also
but
the
step
was
taken
they
could
only
hope
to
carry
matters
through
at
the
port
office
hinze
was
a
thin
man
in
a
sailor
s
jacket
who
looked
over
his
shoulder
back
at
the
captain
as
he
led
them
down
the
cobbles
to
a
brick
building
that
lalette
remembered
all
too
well
you
will
find
it
a
good
voyage
the
ship
is
tight
as
an
egg
but
the
food
not
too
good
said
he
there
was
a
doorman
in
his
coop
who
directed
hinze
down
a
hall
whereupon
the
girl
clutched
rodvard
s
arm
and
said
i
do
not
like
this
a
silly
remark
he
thought
we
can
not
run
away
now
he
said
it
is
the
only
chance
and
hinze
was
back
to
say
that
the
protostylarion
would
entertain
them
at
once
there
could
be
only
a
moment
of
waiting
they
looked
at
each
other
apprehensively
lalette
leaned
against
a
wall
and
closed
her
eyes
and
a
man
came
down
the
hall
to
call
them
in
rodvard
led
the
way
into
a
room
where
a
little
man
sat
behind
a
desk
with
lines
of
disobligingness
set
round
his
mouth
he
said
you
wish
to
leave
the
dominion
of
mancherei
for
the
barbarous
green
islands
it
is
because
of
a
family
matter
said
rodvard
my
wife
and
the
protostylarion
looked
at
lalette
s
hair
down
in
the
then
quickly
at
rodvard
and
back
to
her
face
wrinkles
shot
up
the
middle
of
his
forehead
wife
wife
what
is
your
profession
where
is
your
certificate
of
employ
he
came
up
out
of
his
seat
like
a
small
bear
rodvard
thought
peering
the
more
intently
at
the
girl
ah
i
have
it
i
know
you
are
the
one
i
registered
for
the
myonessae
the
dossolan
and
a
witch
too
guards
guards
his
voice
went
treble
two
or
three
armed
men
tumbled
into
the
room
an
inquiry
said
the
protostylarion
flinging
up
his
arm
to
point
at
the
couple
as
hinze
shrank
back
these
two
for
an
inquiry
i
accuse
her
of
being
a
runaway
myonessan
the
face
was
distorted
the
thought
behind
it
one
of
the
purest
delight
and
triumph
be
careful
with
her
she
is
a
witch
rodvard
was
gripped
above
the
elbow
and
jerked
stumbling
to
the
door
catching
only
a
glimpse
of
lalette
s
despairing
face
outside
people
stopped
and
goggled
as
the
two
were
hurried
along
and
into
a
carriage
with
a
guard
beside
each
i
am
sorry
began
rodvard
but
one
of
the
guards
said
close
your
clack
no
talking
among
his
eyes
spoke
a
brutality
that
would
have
taken
pleasure
in
a
blow
they
came
to
a
structure
with
a
battlemented
gate
like
a
small
fortress
an
odor
of
sewage
emanated
from
it
a
pair
of
guards
brought
forward
bills
in
salutation
to
those
entering
rodvard
and
lalette
were
swung
into
a
where
a
man
lounged
at
a
officer
by
his
one
of
the
guards
said
these
two
are
in
for
an
inquiry
authority
of
the
protostylarion
barthvödi
he
says
to
be
careful
of
the
woman
she
s
a
the
officer
looked
at
lalette
appreciatively
then
seated
himself
at
the
desk
and
drew
out
a
paper
your
names
and
professions
he
said
rodvard
gave
his
lalette
checked
over
the
profession
wishing
to
cry
out
that
she
would
not
give
it
wishing
to
defy
the
man
the
officer
looked
at
her
you
are
warned
he
said
that
i
am
diaconal
and
your
witchery
will
be
wasted
on
oh
she
said
and
which
couvertine
the
more
trouble
it
is
to
obtain
the
information
the
harder
it
will
be
with
the
officer
turned
to
one
of
the
guards
go
to
the
couvertine
of
lolau
and
inform
the
mattern
that
she
is
to
come
here
tomorrow
morning
at
the
fourth
glass
for
an
inquiry
in
the
matter
of
demoiselle
he
addressed
the
other
guard
you
wait
here
while
i
draw
the
proclamation
calling
for
information
on
this
bergelin
then
take
it
rodvard
thought
of
leece
and
wondered
what
she
would
say
in
answer
to
the
proclamation
lalette
of
facing
dame
quasso
again
another
pair
of
guards
came
in
to
take
them
to
stone
cells
set
in
the
wall
of
the
fortress
rodvard
saw
lalette
vanish
into
one
and
heard
the
door
clang
behind
her
then
was
himself
thrust
into
another
there
was
a
stool
and
straw
on
the
floor
an
for
the
only
lighting
the
place
stank
the
origin
of
which
odor
was
a
bucket
beneath
the
he
sat
on
the
stool
and
tried
to
think
but
the
turmoil
of
fear
held
him
so
that
he
could
do
little
more
than
run
around
back
and
over
his
own
conduct
like
a
mouse
to
ask
where
he
had
stepped
wrongly
and
what
else
he
could
have
done
to
make
things
come
out
other
than
they
were
this
was
the
morning
when
leece
and
he
would
have
been
bound
to
her
for
life
no
that
could
not
have
been
the
right
path
farther
back
then
when
he
asked
that
he
went
off
into
a
train
of
reminiscence
in
which
thought
almost
ceased
his
throat
was
dry
there
was
no
water
in
the
cell
nor
did
he
seem
to
have
near
neighbors
all
being
silence
around
save
that
somewhere
a
tiny
drip
of
water
increased
his
thirst
would
he
be
able
to
hold
anything
back
tomorrow
morning
at
the
inquiry
where
an
initiate
would
surely
question
round
the
circuit
of
his
failure
his
mind
ran
again
and
slid
off
into
a
consideration
of
present
circumstance
he
rose
going
to
the
door
but
even
the
small
trap
in
it
would
not
open
from
his
side
alone
not
for
the
first
time
how
like
the
imprisonment
on
the
ship
this
was
and
how
dark
the
prospect
had
loomed
then
out
of
that
he
had
risen
but
to
what
a
choice
between
leece
and
this
a
wave
of
misery
swept
across
him
and
then
he
thought
of
lalette
and
her
misery
equal
to
his
own
and
maybe
more
but
this
was
no
help
either
and
he
began
to
examine
his
prison
by
for
something
that
might
take
his
mind
away
from
this
procession
of
regrets
and
anxieties
toward
a
future
he
could
not
know
there
were
only
accidents
of
the
wall
at
first
in
which
he
tried
to
see
pictures
and
carvings
making
up
a
tale
for
himself
like
those
in
the
ballads
this
had
not
gone
far
when
he
came
to
a
trace
of
writing
which
looked
as
though
someone
had
tried
to
wipe
it
out
for
there
were
only
a
few
words
to
be
read
horv
in
the
month
only
for
lov
a
cryptic
message
indeed
he
tried
to
imagine
the
tale
behind
it
and
how
the
love
of
which
these
amorosians
forever
gabbled
had
brought
someone
to
this
cell
this
caused
him
to
ask
himself
whether
it
was
really
love
for
lalette
that
had
brought
him
there
for
that
matter
whether
he
loved
her
and
what
love
was
and
to
none
of
these
questions
could
he
find
a
satisfactory
answer
because
he
kept
comparing
her
with
maritzl
and
wondering
whether
the
emotion
were
the
same
but
this
in
turn
brought
a
deep
weariness
he
flung
himself
on
the
straw
to
rest
and
work
the
matter
out
and
so
doing
fell
into
an
uneasy
of
his
sleepless
which
he
dreamed
that
the
world
was
ruled
not
by
the
god
he
had
been
taught
to
believe
in
nor
disputed
by
the
two
gods
of
whom
the
amorosians
spoke
but
by
three
demons
who
sat
in
a
closed
space
with
smoke
pouring
from
their
mouths
and
decided
what
penalties
should
be
exacted
for
witchery
a
key
grated
he
woke
to
see
the
trap
being
pulled
back
from
without
and
a
voice
said
roughly
here
s
your
banquet
my
lord
the
sweetmeats
come
with
the
dancing
a
plate
was
thrust
through
with
a
pewter
mug
of
water
on
the
former
were
some
vegetables
cold
and
sticky
and
no
table
utensils
but
rodvard
was
in
a
mood
of
hunger
that
forbade
him
to
be
and
he
ate
saving
part
of
his
water
to
cleanse
his
fingers
after
the
meal
it
was
hardly
done
before
the
trap
opened
again
and
the
outer
voice
demanded
the
tools
the
administration
doesn
t
give
souvenirs
to
its
rodvard
passed
the
dishes
through
and
seated
himself
again
time
ticked
the
light
that
had
been
fading
when
he
woke
was
all
gone
he
had
slept
so
much
that
he
could
do
so
no
more
and
the
uncertainty
of
his
lot
held
him
from
consecutive
thought
somewhere
outside
there
was
a
thin
cry
and
a
sound
of
feet
then
quiet
again
but
for
the
briefest
space
and
now
another
key
grated
in
the
main
lock
of
his
door
it
was
flung
open
in
the
space
stood
a
small
man
and
a
dark
with
no
cap
behind
him
a
smoky
torch
held
by
another
showed
this
first
visitor
to
be
holding
a
naked
sword
that
dripped
plash
plash
on
the
stone
you
are
bergelin
he
said
i
call
myself
demadé
slair
the
revolt
has
begun
have
you
the
blue
star
safe
ii
questions
whirled
in
rodvard
s
mind
but
the
larger
of
the
pair
said
hurry
and
gripped
him
by
the
elbow
like
the
guard
who
had
brought
him
in
dragging
along
the
corridor
wait
said
rodvard
resisting
there
is
we
must
hurry
said
demadé
slair
you
do
not
know
how
desperate
a
business
this
is
we
have
had
to
no
i
will
not
leave
her
she
is
my
sweetheart
my
you
have
her
here
of
the
two
of
you
she
is
the
more
important
where
is
she
at
the
third
cell
here
i
without
another
word
slair
counted
off
the
torch
cordisso
and
began
to
try
keys
from
a
chain
of
them
the
big
man
advanced
the
torch
but
the
place
held
only
some
babbling
furtive
creature
with
white
hair
and
idiot
eyes
the
next
cell
was
empty
slair
swore
furiously
you
are
sure
your
doxy
s
here
she
was
brought
in
with
he
tried
another
door
it
was
she
rising
surprised
from
the
floor
in
a
whirl
of
dresses
rodvard
pushed
past
the
small
man
to
grip
her
by
the
hands
come
and
she
made
small
uncomprehending
sounds
rodvard
put
an
arm
around
her
and
drew
her
toward
the
door
reverse
of
the
stair
by
which
they
had
been
brought
in
in
the
torchlight
rodvard
saw
a
pair
of
feet
at
the
base
a
dead
man
one
of
the
guards
in
spite
of
the
hurry
he
paused
to
unbelt
the
fellow
s
dag
and
rushed
with
the
rest
feeling
more
a
man
again
now
the
lost
knife
was
replaced
at
the
outer
gate
stood
two
more
men
hoods
pulled
over
their
faces
they
saluted
demadé
respectively
and
led
across
the
street
to
where
a
carriage
stood
pushing
lalette
into
the
back
seat
there
were
three
horses
one
in
front
of
the
pair
according
to
the
mancherei
fashion
one
of
the
hooded
men
cracked
his
whip
and
they
were
off
at
a
bumping
pace
as
demadé
slair
said
it
is
as
well
you
were
placed
in
arrest
and
proclaimed
this
afternoon
we
should
not
have
known
how
to
find
you
who
sent
remigorius
a
shadow
winked
across
the
man
s
face
even
in
the
dark
the
high
center
i
say
the
revolt
has
begun
and
they
are
in
rule
but
you
shall
be
told
everything
he
would
say
no
more
the
carriage
bumped
across
cobbles
and
they
were
at
the
dock
with
a
man
holding
a
by
its
side
slair
leaped
down
without
offering
a
hand
to
lalette
and
sprang
across
the
plank
of
a
ship
with
hurry
already
as
she
and
rodvard
reached
the
deck
a
whistle
was
blown
and
men
were
moving
rapidly
among
the
ropes
they
followed
their
guide
s
beckoning
down
a
ladder
to
a
cabin
he
set
the
lantern
on
a
table
let
yourselves
be
placed
and
hear
me
carefully
he
said
it
is
of
the
utmost
moment
to
the
cause
and
everything
that
you
are
not
caught
or
even
held
back
if
the
guards
come
aboard
if
we
are
stopped
by
a
galley
as
we
leave
the
harbor
you
are
strictly
to
go
down
the
ladder
leftward
of
this
cabin
at
its
base
is
a
pile
of
bales
of
goods
of
which
one
is
hollowed
out
to
take
a
man
with
a
flap
at
the
edge
that
can
be
pulled
to
from
inside
insert
yourself
and
pull
the
a
thrill
more
of
excitement
than
apprehension
shot
through
rodvard
the
thought
of
being
as
important
as
this
to
the
great
enterprise
he
said
if
this
ship
s
invaded
they
will
likely
have
an
initiate
or
at
least
one
of
their
diaconals
with
them
and
from
the
mind
of
anyone
aboard
he
will
be
likely
to
know
where
the
hiding
place
slair
grinned
that
has
been
thought
of
no
one
knows
of
this
hollow
but
me
i
made
it
and
can
take
care
of
lalette
said
and
i
what
shall
i
do
slair
frowned
you
are
a
problem
demoiselle
we
came
for
friend
rodvard
and
his
blue
star
imagining
you
were
still
in
dossola
and
there
s
no
he
put
an
on
his
chin
you
have
the
art
could
you
she
raised
a
hand
ah
no
in
the
flash
of
her
eye
rodvard
saw
how
she
was
thinking
of
some
witchery
on
a
ship
something
terrible
and
sickening
connected
with
it
of
course
said
slair
against
an
initiate
it
would
miss
nine
times
out
of
ten
and
concealment
s
a
weak
resource
no
the
problem
is
one
of
hiding
you
in
plain
sight
that
is
to
let
them
look
but
not
know
your
identity
ah
i
have
it
let
your
hair
down
and
the
hem
of
your
dress
up
to
show
an
ankle
be
one
of
those
travelling
strumpets
who
call
themselves
lalette
said
steadily
how
will
this
deceive
one
of
the
initiates
demadé
slair
made
a
twisting
with
his
mouth
why
demoiselle
these
initiates
are
not
magicians
they
can
read
no
more
than
thoughts
and
not
all
of
those
all
women
have
in
them
a
trifle
of
the
strumpet
you
have
but
to
think
yourself
one
be
one
with
your
mind
it
would
be
a
rare
initiate
to
tell
the
lalette
s
mind
beat
frantic
wings
the
bars
were
there
again
whatever
route
she
took
led
to
the
same
cage
and
rodvard
caught
enough
of
her
thought
to
know
how
deep
was
her
trouble
is
there
not
some
better
plan
he
asked
no
time
see
the
ship
is
demadé
slair
stood
up
so
now
i
must
leave
the
door
banged
behind
him
lalette
said
this
is
a
second
one
prison
to
another
each
time
i
thank
you
her
eyes
flashed
a
dark
color
of
anger
he
knew
what
was
stirring
in
her
mind
but
also
that
if
he
mentioned
it
directly
there
would
be
a
flash
he
said
lalette
let
me
implore
you
i
will
not
quarrel
with
you
about
whose
making
this
trouble
is
or
how
we
seem
to
go
from
one
difficulty
to
another
but
if
we
can
work
together
this
escape
shall
be
better
than
the
last
i
did
not
leave
you
at
the
oh
i
am
grateful
she
said
in
the
tone
of
one
who
is
not
grateful
in
the
least
turning
aside
her
head
if
you
had
he
had
wit
enough
not
to
carry
this
line
on
do
you
know
anything
of
this
revolt
he
asked
she
turned
again
ah
i
can
not
bear
if
that
i
should
never
have
a
thought
of
my
own
while
i
am
with
you
will
you
give
me
back
the
blue
star
no
it
is
all
our
lives
and
fortune
now
and
the
fate
of
many
more
important
than
i
am
not
beautiful
and
brilliant
like
those
girls
of
noble
houses
but
even
so
would
like
to
be
wanted
for
myself
and
not
what
i
can
outside
the
first
caught
the
ship
she
turned
her
face
again
queasy
at
her
stomach
they
slept
in
on
opposite
sides
of
the
cabin
netznegon
return
to
glory
the
skies
were
filled
with
glory
the
new
day
rising
the
man
who
called
himself
demadé
slair
explained
leaning
against
the
rail
at
the
waist
of
the
ship
in
the
morning
a
day
anointed
with
white
in
the
form
of
a
circling
seagull
it
s
an
intricate
tale
he
said
of
which
the
sum
is
that
we
are
unlikely
to
see
queens
in
netznegon
again
but
i
ll
begin
with
cleudi
s
plan
for
having
the
nobles
gather
taxes
in
their
seignories
they
would
not
have
something
like
that
seemed
to
be
happening
when
i
was
at
the
conference
of
court
said
rodvard
they
say
there
was
a
scene
to
remember
when
florestan
told
the
old
bitch
there
was
no
more
money
slair
went
on
with
a
laugh
she
beat
him
about
the
head
with
a
slipper
and
for
days
he
wore
a
patch
over
one
lalette
said
she
is
your
she
wanted
to
cry
out
to
say
something
that
would
drive
this
man
to
fury
rodvard
drew
her
hand
toward
him
but
she
pulled
it
away
demadé
slair
said
i
crave
your
pardon
demoiselle
truly
i
did
not
know
you
were
so
royalist
then
brunivar
fell
you
heard
of
it
rodvard
said
i
have
had
little
news
buried
in
charalkis
only
that
there
were
attainted
of
treasons
and
sent
to
the
the
case
was
pressed
by
the
duke
of
aggermans
very
violent
against
him
no
one
altogether
knows
i
think
i
could
find
a
no
doubt
with
your
stone
but
d
you
see
the
situation
that
left
with
brunivar
gone
there
s
no
in
the
case
of
her
majesty
s
death
which
may
fall
any
day
i
think
it
was
you
who
sent
word
to
the
center
that
florestan
expected
the
regency
in
his
room
very
like
he
would
have
had
it
too
but
for
the
tax
matter
but
the
regency
question
furnishing
an
excuse
the
nobles
summoned
a
general
assembly
of
all
the
estates
and
once
they
were
met
they
began
to
consider
and
the
revolt
oh
it
began
in
the
veierelden
with
some
of
the
army
and
not
with
our
party
at
all
brunivar
s
people
joined
setting
forward
the
name
of
prince
pavinius
and
how
he
was
wrongfully
set
aside
from
the
succession
and
had
long
since
abandoned
being
an
amorosian
they
even
persuaded
the
old
man
to
come
out
of
mayern
and
raise
his
standard
most
of
the
nobles
have
gone
there
with
what
troops
there
are
but
i
don
t
know
how
much
fighting
there
has
been
neither
side
s
very
anxious
for
war
the
important
thing
is
that
the
great
assembly
was
left
in
session
with
the
nobles
out
of
it
and
you
can
see
what
that
not
quite
enlighten
why
our
party
in
the
majority
and
mathurin
in
control
of
rodvard
turned
a
face
of
utter
astonishment
mathurin
i
might
have
thought
slair
laughed
again
a
sharp
bark
bergelin
for
one
who
can
see
the
thoughts
in
a
head
you
are
the
ignorantest
man
i
have
one
of
the
he
shot
a
quick
glance
of
suspicion
at
rodvard
you
truly
did
not
know
that
mathurin
was
the
head
of
the
high
center
the
major
leader
of
the
sons
as
for
remigorius
the
less
you
mention
him
the
better
some
connections
are
not
quite
i
did
not
know
said
rodvard
slowly
trying
in
his
mind
to
the
tumbled
of
his
world
but
i
the
blue
star
s
a
treasure
but
why
send
a
ship
for
such
a
mouse
as
i
am
answer
your
own
question
friend
bergelin
look
here
s
pavinius
the
court
our
party
with
its
control
of
the
great
assembly
maybe
some
of
tritulaccan
tendency
and
a
few
opposed
to
each
other
you
are
the
only
man
we
know
can
untangle
where
the
true
loyalties
lie
and
discover
whom
we
can
but
surely
this
is
not
the
only
blue
the
only
one
we
can
be
sure
of
we
know
the
court
butler
tuolén
had
one
perhaps
there
is
one
or
more
in
pavinius
you
say
does
tuolén
have
it
no
longer
slair
looked
sidewise
with
something
a
little
savage
in
his
glance
an
accident
befell
him
you
know
said
lalette
if
i
understand
what
you
mean
you
had
him
killed
but
this
would
not
affect
the
blue
star
not
if
we
could
find
the
heiress
and
there
s
another
question
also
suppose
we
have
found
her
does
she
know
enough
of
the
art
to
make
the
star
active
true
witches
are
very
hard
to
find
with
the
episcopals
so
bitter
against
the
art
on
the
one
hand
and
the
amorosians
draining
so
many
off
to
mancherei
on
the
my
began
lalette
oh
mathurin
followed
that
line
up
long
ago
she
could
instruct
but
would
she
i
think
not
for
our
party
the
last
i
heard
she
had
followed
cleudi
and
the
court
out
to
zenss
you
two
are
our
rodvard
thinking
of
the
witch
of
kazmerga
and
thinking
also
that
it
would
be
little
good
for
the
sons
of
the
new
day
to
have
commerce
with
her
said
it
should
not
be
hard
to
trace
tuolén
s
heiress
i
was
in
the
office
of
pedigree
myself
one
more
reason
why
you
re
a
figure
i
ll
conceal
nothing
most
of
those
who
can
read
the
old
hands
or
trace
the
pedigrees
are
either
fled
with
the
court
or
little
trusty
we
dare
not
place
reliance
in
them
and
it
s
a
matter
of
hurry
with
the
armies
in
the
west
both
anxious
to
do
us
harms
and
even
the
tritulaccans
calling
out
new
a
whistle
blew
men
moved
among
the
ropes
the
ship
changed
slant
rodvard
said
what
you
say
is
very
strange
i
would
like
to
ah
enough
of
politics
for
now
i
must
make
my
apologies
to
this
lovely
demoiselle
for
having
spoken
he
offered
his
arm
to
lalette
will
you
honor
me
rodvard
was
left
standing
and
not
for
the
only
time
either
in
the
next
three
or
four
days
for
lalette
formed
the
habit
of
walking
with
slair
along
the
deck
she
laughing
and
both
of
them
talking
of
trifles
in
a
manner
that
seemed
to
rodvard
inane
and
pointless
of
an
evening
the
girl
would
hardly
speak
at
all
or
if
she
did
so
it
was
in
a
flat
voice
shunning
his
eyes
so
that
he
could
tell
little
of
what
she
was
thinking
at
night
she
shut
herself
in
her
before
undressing
this
became
so
intolerable
that
at
last
he
rose
one
night
and
tapped
on
the
door
of
her
bed
open
he
said
and
over
the
noise
of
the
thuttering
rigging
heard
her
say
faintly
rodvard
open
i
say
he
cried
again
you
must
hear
there
was
a
silence
of
seven
breaths
and
then
he
heard
her
spin
the
lock
lalette
he
said
why
do
you
treat
me
so
have
i
treated
you
worse
than
you
have
treated
me
he
fought
back
an
impulse
to
a
retort
that
would
bring
angers
i
do
not
know
that
i
follow
all
you
there
was
only
from
the
window
she
emboldened
at
knowing
he
could
not
learn
her
fullest
thought
will
you
still
say
you
did
not
cheat
me
now
that
i
know
you
were
always
one
of
the
sons
of
the
new
day
tuolén
had
an
the
doorman
at
your
how
many
more
i
used
to
believe
in
some
things
before
you
trapped
no
trap
said
he
jerking
back
so
violently
he
struck
a
beam
and
gave
an
exclamation
no
trap
you
can
not
make
a
new
world
without
destroying
some
of
the
old
and
some
suffer
unjustly
for
every
in
a
small
voice
she
said
i
lalette
he
said
gravely
and
not
taking
offense
listen
to
me
we
of
the
sons
of
the
new
day
are
truly
striving
for
a
better
world
one
in
which
there
are
such
things
as
honesty
and
justice
for
everyone
but
this
much
i
have
learned
and
not
from
remigorius
that
any
such
effort
is
a
swimming
against
the
world
s
stream
and
must
be
paid
for
you
feel
used
myself
no
less
but
i
like
to
think
of
myself
as
used
for
the
betterment
of
by
his
voice
was
a
little
unsteady
at
the
end
and
now
it
was
her
turn
to
be
silent
for
a
moment
at
last
she
said
and
how
do
you
know
the
use
is
for
someone
s
personal
pleasure
in
ordering
others
what
you
say
is
not
too
different
from
the
teaching
i
heard
at
the
couvertine
only
there
they
would
say
that
god
uses
no
earthly
do
you
believe
that
ah
i
do
not
know
i
only
know
that
i
am
tired
and
alone
alone
the
words
tailed
off
he
heard
her
shift
in
the
darkness
of
the
bed
and
then
the
intake
of
a
sob
lalette
don
t
he
bent
over
wiping
a
tear
from
her
face
then
as
it
was
followed
by
more
fell
to
kissing
her
eyes
i
love
you
for
the
first
time
since
that
night
on
the
roofs
lalette
more
and
more
he
kissed
from
eyes
to
lips
and
she
gripped
her
arms
around
him
because
he
was
the
nearest
anchor
in
a
shifting
world
and
his
kissing
turned
to
passion
as
she
had
known
it
would
and
what
did
it
matter
but
she
was
only
a
recipient
and
to
rodvard
it
was
a
relief
and
an
agony
in
that
moment
he
wished
it
had
been
leece
ii
it
was
after
sunset
bell
when
they
came
upstream
to
netznegon
city
its
gated
towers
rising
dark
against
the
west
like
the
worn
teeth
of
giants
rodvard
stood
near
the
prow
hearing
the
measured
cry
of
seamen
at
the
sweeps
through
all
he
felt
the
golden
note
of
glory
returning
dossola
he
murmured
to
himself
strong
and
fair
how
shall
i
contribute
to
your
greatness
and
so
find
my
own
he
felt
himself
making
a
poem
of
it
but
in
a
rush
of
emotion
so
intense
that
he
could
not
bring
the
rhymes
quite
true
nor
the
rhythm
neither
quite
and
when
he
tried
to
pause
and
think
consciously
of
how
the
verses
should
go
the
emotion
vanished
and
the
dark
city
was
only
a
tumbled
pile
of
stone
the
bridge
leading
to
the
southern
suburbs
blotted
out
the
prospect
little
white
cakes
of
ice
came
swimming
like
ducks
down
the
stream
and
the
ship
swung
to
its
quay
the
one
around
the
curve
there
were
lanterns
there
and
a
little
group
waiting
they
must
have
been
seen
from
the
walls
and
the
word
passed
through
to
meet
them
someone
hallooed
to
rodvard
from
the
stern
of
the
ship
demadé
slair
was
waiting
there
with
lalette
muffled
close
in
her
long
cloak
rodvard
thought
we
are
come
back
to
dossola
both
of
us
as
naked
as
when
we
left
it
but
at
least
with
more
hope
said
slair
it
would
be
as
well
to
hurry
it
does
not
do
to
be
on
the
streets
too
much
at
night
these
the
back
of
rodvard
s
mind
recognized
that
he
had
given
lalette
no
more
than
a
priest
s
argument
that
night
in
the
and
wished
that
he
had
found
a
better
since
she
must
see
the
defect
in
this
one
but
what
how
educate
her
to
the
ideal
the
plank
was
flung
five
or
six
men
were
at
the
other
end
one
of
them
in
a
provost
s
cloak
but
the
shoes
were
not
like
what
they
should
be
nor
did
the
doublet
seem
to
belong
to
the
uniform
a
longsword
bulged
out
the
cloak
the
eyes
flicked
past
rodvard
to
rest
on
lalette
demadé
slair
identified
himself
and
shepherded
his
charges
past
a
dark
shed
to
the
street
a
man
was
there
with
a
horse
slair
spoke
to
him
he
swung
himself
into
the
saddle
and
rode
off
said
rodvard
to
say
something
that
provost
seemed
in
an
inquiring
slair
this
was
no
provost
the
general
assembly
has
abolished
that
hateful
order
what
you
saw
was
a
people
s
rodvard
this
is
a
different
slair
it
will
be
a
better
lalette
said
where
are
we
going
to
the
of
the
nation
that
used
to
be
the
palace
of
baron
ulutz
who
has
fled
to
join
pavinius
the
man
has
gone
for
a
the
conversation
winked
out
around
a
corner
of
the
street
somewhere
in
the
dim
there
was
a
shout
that
came
to
them
only
as
the
confused
yaya
of
many
throats
followed
by
a
crash
of
glass
and
then
another
shout
what
is
it
rodvard
looked
at
slair
some
of
the
people
doubtless
you
should
know
there
are
many
debts
being
paid
these
he
shrugged
lalette
stirred
without
the
blue
star
s
intervention
rodvard
knew
that
she
would
find
in
this
wild
lawlessness
the
case
against
his
new
day
he
said
is
there
much
of
this
from
day
to
day
the
man
s
voice
was
indifferent
enough
it
is
mostly
zigraner
moneylenders
who
round
the
corner
came
a
carriage
with
a
single
horse
the
messenger
riding
ahead
you
will
report
to
the
office
of
the
committee
at
the
second
glass
in
the
morning
said
slair
to
the
rider
the
fellow
s
chin
was
badly
shaven
he
leaned
from
the
saddle
and
said
well
friend
slair
i
will
do
the
best
i
can
but
it
will
be
hard
to
ride
more
messages
so
early
for
mousey
here
is
nearly
done
and
she
s
my
rodvard
now
noticed
that
the
horse
was
drooping
with
weariness
but
demadé
slair
said
if
you
lose
one
there
s
another
the
people
s
business
will
not
wait
be
on
the
man
got
slowly
down
and
patted
the
neck
of
the
horse
friend
slair
he
said
i
am
as
much
for
the
people
as
anyone
but
there
s
more
to
this
than
livelihood
this
is
my
the
tired
horse
sniffed
at
the
hand
he
put
up
slair
surprisingly
burst
into
laughter
go
then
with
your
friend
i
ll
be
your
warranty
if
you
are
the
carriage
had
wide
seats
lalette
huddled
down
in
the
corner
so
that
rodvard
was
barely
touching
the
edge
of
her
cloak
and
slair
sat
facing
them
beyond
the
corner
where
the
turbulence
was
figures
were
visible
at
a
little
distance
and
torches
moving
but
nobody
said
anything
in
the
vehicle
because
thought
rodvard
there
was
so
much
to
say
presently
they
turned
in
at
the
gate
of
the
ulutz
palace
where
some
statue
on
the
had
been
thrown
down
leaving
broken
stone
across
the
cobbles
there
were
lights
in
the
building
but
no
doorman
demadé
slair
led
the
way
and
straight
up
the
wide
flight
of
marble
steps
to
a
room
where
he
struck
light
to
a
candle
a
huge
bed
stood
in
the
corner
and
one
of
the
chairs
had
been
slit
so
that
the
material
of
the
upholstery
flowed
upon
the
carpet
i
bid
you
said
their
guide
there
s
a
kitchen
where
you
can
have
breakfast
and
a
messenger
will
call
for
you
in
the
morning
friend
when
they
were
alone
lalette
sat
in
the
good
chair
with
her
hands
in
her
lap
and
looked
at
her
feet
rodvard
she
said
at
last
yes
his
heart
jumped
hopefully
be
careful
you
are
not
so
important
to
them
as
you
think
if
you
they
might
make
me
give
the
blue
star
to
someone
could
they
compel
you
to
put
the
witchery
on
it
no
but
they
might
find
another
witch
he
went
over
to
her
but
at
his
touch
she
made
a
small
gesture
of
dismissal
as
though
to
rebuke
him
for
bringing
something
childish
into
a
moment
of
utter
intensity
i
am
afraid
rodvard
don
t
let
them
do
that
to
he
stepped
away
from
her
ah
pest
you
are
shying
at
shadows
i
am
a
member
of
the
sons
and
even
so
you
have
the
yes
i
have
she
only
undressed
to
a
shift
and
wrapped
it
close
around
her
sleeping
on
the
far
side
of
the
bed
the
water
was
very
cold
speeches
in
the
great
assembly
it
was
the
old
hall
of
presence
the
throne
stood
as
before
its
dark
wood
bright
with
jewels
and
the
jewelled
star
bright
above
it
so
that
rodvard
felt
at
his
back
almost
a
palpable
emanation
of
dossola
s
high
fame
before
him
chairs
had
been
swung
out
from
the
walls
into
the
space
where
all
had
once
stood
to
hear
judgments
pronounced
from
the
throne
as
in
the
great
days
of
king
crotinianus
and
other
chairs
brought
in
not
consonant
with
those
already
there
he
himself
occupied
the
seat
once
reserved
to
the
announcer
two
steps
up
a
board
was
placed
for
him
to
write
on
since
this
was
to
be
the
pretence
for
his
being
there
to
the
right
another
step
up
was
the
place
once
occupied
by
the
chamberlain
which
mathurin
would
presently
take
it
also
had
a
board
rodvard
looked
out
across
the
hall
now
filling
with
men
most
of
whom
bowed
to
the
throne
on
entering
in
the
ancient
form
very
few
were
badged
with
coronets
and
it
seemed
to
rodvard
a
cause
of
hope
and
pleasure
that
this
was
so
there
was
a
solid
group
of
legists
some
merchants
and
a
few
men
from
the
lesser
orders
though
not
as
many
as
he
had
expected
as
he
watched
the
episcopals
came
in
six
of
the
seven
at
once
not
looking
around
at
the
fall
and
sudden
rise
of
chatter
that
attended
their
entrance
they
moved
to
places
in
the
premier
row
of
chairs
legist
badges
began
drifting
toward
them
as
straws
on
a
stream
will
be
drawn
by
a
log
mathurin
came
in
he
wore
his
servant
s
black
and
badge
of
low
condition
as
though
they
were
robes
and
a
crown
strutting
visibly
he
did
not
bow
to
the
throne
but
walked
straight
up
to
the
chamberlain
s
place
sat
down
bounced
up
again
immediately
and
slapped
his
palm
on
the
board
for
attention
as
the
buzz
of
talk
died
reluctantly
and
men
took
their
places
he
watched
with
tight
lips
when
only
two
or
three
whisperers
remained
he
struck
the
board
again
and
said
there
is
a
new
matter
of
utmost
importance
before
the
assembly
of
the
a
man
who
bore
the
coronet
badge
stood
up
into
the
dramatic
pause
and
said
i
am
the
marquis
of
palm
there
is
an
old
matter
for
which
this
assembly
was
called
that
i
shall
never
cease
to
urge
no
has
he
was
allowed
to
say
no
more
a
chorus
of
angry
babblings
covered
his
voice
and
mathurin
slapped
sharply
his
voice
rose
i
am
only
the
writer
before
this
assembly
and
will
place
before
it
whatever
is
desired
but
it
does
not
seem
to
me
that
it
wishes
to
hear
your
proposal
ser
marquis
the
more
since
the
matter
of
which
i
speak
is
so
great
that
it
overrides
every
other
i
have
to
say
that
the
nation
already
threatened
by
exterior
enemies
is
now
called
upon
to
face
a
worse
danger
one
that
will
call
for
all
our
exertions
it
is
this
the
leaders
in
whom
we
have
most
trusted
have
turned
traitor
and
are
conspiring
with
the
enemies
of
the
now
there
were
more
babblings
and
angry
cries
such
as
cut
their
throats
with
a
couple
of
fists
brandished
aloft
but
rodvard
noticed
that
all
the
outcry
came
from
one
section
of
the
hall
behind
the
episcopals
one
of
the
latter
began
fanning
himself
rapidly
instead
of
quieting
the
tumult
augmented
as
mathurin
stood
sweeping
his
eyes
across
it
with
a
air
at
last
he
raised
a
hand
i
will
tell
you
the
worst
he
said
not
in
fine
words
but
brutally
for
this
is
a
brutal
he
shuffled
a
handfull
of
papers
no
wait
i
will
begin
with
the
tale
of
how
this
knowledge
reached
us
at
drog
below
the
pass
that
leads
through
the
ragged
mountains
to
rushaca
there
is
an
inn
some
eight
days
gone
there
came
to
it
a
carriage
bearing
one
of
the
ladies
of
the
court
oh
a
beautiful
lady
all
dressed
as
though
for
a
ball
she
came
from
the
north
from
zenss
where
the
court
is
and
as
the
road
leads
to
tritulacca
ultimately
her
actions
roused
some
suspicion
in
the
mind
of
the
innkeeper
he
is
a
true
patriot
and
thought
she
might
be
carrying
wealth
away
out
of
the
country
in
violation
of
the
decree
against
it
watched
her
and
noticed
that
she
was
very
careful
of
a
certain
casket
the
innkeeper
thereupon
summoned
people
s
guards
who
seized
the
casket
and
broke
it
open
they
found
no
money
but
they
mathurin
drew
from
his
papers
one
that
seemed
to
be
of
parchment
and
waved
it
aloft
so
that
all
could
see
that
it
bore
at
its
foot
a
huge
blue
seal
the
of
the
chancery
of
the
realm
there
were
sharp
intakes
of
breath
and
stirring
among
the
chairs
the
episcopal
who
had
been
fanning
himself
stopped
the
sturdy
man
who
had
described
himself
as
the
marquis
of
palm
stared
aloft
with
his
mouth
open
and
a
frown
on
his
face
shall
i
read
it
to
you
no
not
word
for
word
for
it
is
written
in
tritulaccan
and
with
the
stupid
decorative
court
phrases
that
try
to
hide
real
rodvard
thought
he
has
more
orator
s
tricks
than
i
ever
would
have
imagined
pause
here
it
is
then
a
missive
signed
with
the
name
of
count
cleudi
himself
a
tritulaccan
by
birth
to
perisso
lord
regent
of
tritulacca
but
bearing
as
proof
of
genuineness
the
seal
of
our
gracious
majesty
the
queen
the
substance
of
it
is
that
while
without
doubt
the
rebellion
of
her
cousin
pavinius
aided
though
he
is
by
the
mayerns
will
soon
be
put
down
the
war
is
likely
to
be
long
and
wasteful
her
gracious
majesty
therefore
consents
to
the
proposal
of
the
lord
perisso
made
in
the
name
of
true
religion
and
the
old
friendship
between
the
two
houses
that
he
shall
join
the
army
of
dossola
with
not
less
than
sixteen
shars
and
in
return
for
this
it
is
graciously
conceded
that
tritulacca
has
a
just
claim
to
the
city
and
province
of
sedad
mir
and
some
of
these
tritulaccan
shars
shall
pass
to
the
war
by
way
of
netznegon
city
to
suppress
certain
disorders
there
the
rats
there
is
no
dealing
with
such
people
shame
shouted
someone
almost
before
he
had
finished
and
now
all
over
the
hall
men
were
on
their
feet
and
shouting
but
among
other
cries
there
was
one
of
forgery
mathurin
seemed
to
be
waiting
for
that
moment
forgery
he
cried
his
voice
going
up
almost
to
the
if
you
think
it
is
forgery
look
at
it
yourself
and
threw
the
paper
outward
as
one
might
the
caught
hunted
animal
to
the
dogs
will
you
call
it
forgery
when
i
tell
you
also
that
the
whole
tritulaccan
fleet
has
been
placed
on
war
standard
the
nation
is
betrayed
now
the
tumult
seemed
completely
out
of
hand
men
moving
from
place
to
place
confusedly
or
trying
to
say
something
and
in
every
eye
rodvard
could
catch
there
was
nothing
but
mere
fury
which
expressed
itself
in
a
color
of
maroon
mathurin
looked
out
on
the
scene
making
no
effort
at
control
but
from
the
first
row
there
rose
a
tall
old
man
with
white
hair
and
a
face
set
in
a
habitual
expression
of
benevolence
who
raised
high
his
white
staff
of
office
by
which
rodvard
recognized
him
as
the
teurapis
groadon
eyes
caught
the
staff
voice
after
voice
was
abstracted
from
the
uproar
until
only
a
few
still
tried
to
speak
then
two
then
none
the
waited
until
there
was
a
silence
broken
only
by
a
cough
mathurin
pressed
rodvard
s
shoulder
to
read
the
eyes
but
the
old
man
only
cast
one
swift
glance
at
the
dais
before
turning
to
address
the
assembly
ser
writer
he
said
and
you
lords
and
estates
of
the
realm
this
is
not
a
pleasant
thing
that
we
have
heard
there
may
be
some
question
of
the
authenticity
of
this
message
or
it
may
have
been
written
merely
to
deceive
a
document
from
the
hand
of
the
heretic
pavinius
who
would
make
himself
the
equal
of
god
yet
i
will
not
deny
that
we
must
behave
as
though
it
were
true
for
if
we
do
nothing
and
it
proves
to
be
so
it
will
be
too
late
and
for
myself
i
fear
it
is
true
for
it
is
given
to
the
spiritual
estate
to
discern
the
machinations
of
the
powers
of
evil
there
is
before
us
then
the
question
of
how
joying
in
the
protection
of
god
we
can
circumvent
the
machinations
of
the
enemy
who
has
made
man
and
women
naturally
good
into
instruments
of
evil
let
us
therefore
prayerfully
address
ourselves
to
the
question
of
how
the
realm
may
escape
this
trouble
in
an
emergency
equal
to
this
in
the
reign
of
king
cloar
with
queen
berdette
the
first
the
assembly
of
the
realm
set
aside
their
rule
in
favor
of
their
daughter
with
her
husband
the
great
king
crontinianus
of
glorious
memory
but
now
there
are
no
heirs
female
and
of
heirs
male
only
prince
pavinius
thus
we
seem
faced
with
the
hard
choice
of
accepting
him
and
so
selling
the
soul
to
preserve
the
body
or
of
adhering
to
the
queen
s
will
and
saving
the
soul
through
bodily
submission
to
tritulacca
but
i
do
not
think
god
demands
of
us
such
submission
for
our
god
is
a
god
of
joy
we
are
here
met
in
the
high
assembly
of
the
realm
which
i
hold
to
represent
what
of
the
power
material
has
failed
to
protect
its
own
and
the
power
spiritual
is
fully
represented
therefore
though
such
a
step
has
no
basis
in
law
or
custom
i
say
let
us
set
up
a
regency
in
the
time
of
a
living
queen
it
should
have
members
of
lords
and
estates
to
show
forth
the
source
of
its
authority
and
since
the
true
enemy
is
that
power
of
evil
which
has
led
our
good
queen
astray
i
humbly
offer
to
he
sat
there
was
a
rumor
almost
of
agreement
but
with
a
little
edge
in
it
that
left
rodvard
glad
the
had
ended
so
for
all
the
rest
of
what
he
said
might
have
led
them
to
agree
and
it
seemed
to
rodvard
that
a
regency
with
lords
and
episcopals
on
it
would
be
only
the
old
rule
again
mathurin
jerked
his
finger
toward
one
of
the
brown
legists
who
had
risen
and
was
waiting
for
attention
i
am
the
kronzlar
escholl
said
the
man
i
will
say
that
this
proposal
of
a
regency
in
the
time
of
a
living
ruler
has
good
support
in
law
and
custom
though
it
is
not
generally
known
it
is
now
over
eight
quadrials
of
years
since
king
belodon
the
second
was
killed
at
bregatz
during
the
zigraner
wars
and
few
remember
that
only
three
weeks
before
his
death
it
was
determined
that
he
had
gone
mad
and
the
barons
set
up
a
council
of
regency
we
may
i
think
assume
a
like
madness
in
the
queen
s
majesty
since
her
offer
to
perisso
is
clearly
contrary
both
to
the
law
of
the
realm
and
true
religion
his
claim
to
sedad
mir
is
based
on
descent
in
the
male
line
since
it
is
well
known
that
the
last
count
of
that
seignory
wrongfully
dispossessed
his
sister
who
survived
him
to
pass
on
her
rights
to
the
crown
of
the
bright
morning
light
struck
through
the
window
fairly
on
the
speaker
s
face
and
as
he
took
his
place
rodvard
caught
from
his
eye
a
quick
gleam
of
greed
and
lust
for
power
altogether
surprising
in
one
who
had
spoken
so
dry
and
calmly
he
touched
mathurin
s
arm
to
mention
this
but
now
half
a
dozen
more
were
on
their
feet
to
speak
and
the
writer
before
the
assembly
shot
his
finger
at
a
man
with
a
merchant
s
badge
in
the
group
that
had
made
the
tumult
when
the
marquis
of
palm
was
shouted
down
i
protest
this
one
bawled
i
am
called
brosen
zelitza
we
are
the
assembly
of
the
nation
and
therefore
already
regents
in
our
own
right
why
vest
the
regency
in
a
council
why
should
episcopals
have
the
temporal
power
as
well
as
the
spiritual
if
no
one
else
dares
to
speak
i
will
tell
you
why
it
is
because
they
are
to
tritulacca
they
wish
to
have
the
power
to
complete
cleudi
s
contract
and
their
objection
to
it
is
only
a
the
voice
had
a
curious
dynamic
quality
that
seemed
to
stir
the
very
bones
but
in
rodvard
s
mind
watching
the
face
there
grew
only
a
picture
of
something
with
teeth
he
could
not
make
out
any
mind
or
thought
the
rule
of
these
episcopals
and
their
mercenaries
of
the
priesthood
the
old
customs
of
dossola
were
set
aside
and
it
is
forbidden
that
women
shall
use
the
art
so
dossola
is
being
made
a
like
the
savage
kjermanash
with
women
in
bondage
unable
to
the
voice
was
stirring
them
excitement
in
the
hall
with
movements
and
the
scratch
of
a
chair
priesthood
refuge
of
scoundrels
and
bastards
rodvard
swept
the
line
of
the
episcopals
and
though
they
were
turned
so
he
could
catch
no
eyes
every
pose
told
of
rising
indignation
can
not
define
the
god
they
profess
to
stop
the
was
on
his
feet
again
staff
upraised
ah
the
sword
bites
does
it
conspirator
stop
the
voice
that
was
accustomed
to
dominating
the
vast
recesses
of
the
cathedral
was
thunderous
up
leaped
mathurin
my
lord
episcopal
he
said
this
is
the
great
assembly
of
the
people
where
each
may
speak
in
turn
when
you
have
heard
him
we
will
hear
the
swung
round
and
from
his
eyes
rodvard
could
catch
the
flash
of
anger
clearly
enough
but
that
was
not
the
sole
emotion
and
the
rest
was
veiled
i
will
never
hear
blasphemy
he
said
as
the
highest
officer
of
government
remaining
loyal
to
the
realm
i
declare
this
assembly
dissolved
all
who
love
god
and
dossola
follow
amid
a
renewed
outburst
catcalls
and
shouts
of
approval
mingled
he
lifted
his
staff
high
and
strode
toward
the
door
followed
by
the
others
of
his
class
a
good
half
the
legists
came
behind
the
nobles
stood
but
hung
hesitant
looking
toward
the
strong
marquis
of
palm
and
then
seeing
him
sit
some
returned
to
their
seats
of
the
merchants
some
followed
but
the
little
knot
where
the
shouting
started
remained
in
their
seats
when
the
procession
had
passed
mathurin
said
the
session
for
this
day
is
he
turned
toward
rodvard
and
the
latter
saw
in
the
smiling
eyes
that
everything
had
gone
exactly
according
to
plan
and
zelitza
was
a
good
man
ii
rodvard
left
the
hall
of
presence
alone
more
than
a
little
prideful
at
being
a
partaker
in
great
deeds
at
last
and
wondering
what
the
old
companions
at
the
office
of
pedigree
would
say
who
had
so
looked
down
on
and
baited
him
when
they
knew
he
was
one
of
the
writers
before
the
great
assembly
of
the
nation
silver
spadas
were
in
his
pouch
the
new
clothes
were
neat
it
was
the
finest
day
of
winter
he
felt
he
must
tell
someone
of
his
delight
in
all
lifted
his
head
as
he
strode
and
so
striding
inadvertently
trod
on
the
heel
of
one
before
the
man
turned
to
show
a
face
as
young
as
his
own
and
a
clerical
badge
his
hands
were
hunched
beneath
the
edge
of
his
jacket
i
beg
your
grace
said
rodvard
no
matter
said
the
other
i
was
thinking
did
you
know
that
the
great
assembly
is
going
to
make
itself
a
regency
in
the
place
of
queen
berdette
a
pause
well
now
the
tritulaccan
count
will
find
him
a
better
bedfellow
perhaps
we
ll
have
this
prince
the
episcopals
left
the
another
stop
to
the
conversation
step
step
to
the
corner
side
by
side
the
encounter
glanced
around
with
discomfort
in
his
eyes
at
having
nothing
to
say
have
you
seen
the
new
representation
at
leverdaos
it
is
called
the
maid
s
problem
and
minora
is
interview
at
the
nation
s
lalette
lay
curled
on
the
bed
half
propped
by
pillows
under
her
armpit
demadé
slair
had
unbelted
his
sword
to
sit
down
it
leaned
against
his
chair
mathurin
sat
in
the
one
by
the
table
the
candle
throwing
his
sharp
profile
into
strong
silhouette
rodvard
shifted
in
the
damaged
chair
whose
lost
stuffing
made
his
seat
uneasy
and
that
was
all
said
the
writer
to
the
assembly
pinching
his
lower
lip
nothing
more
from
palm
nothing
more
from
the
other
episcopals
pest
bergelin
you
are
less
useful
than
i
had
there
was
the
legist
who
spoke
said
rodvard
i
think
he
is
a
man
to
beware
of
his
thought
was
so
ruthless
and
desirous
of
power
that
he
would
ride
down
you
mean
the
kronzlar
escholl
that
is
of
some
use
at
all
events
said
mathurin
we
need
more
like
that
whether
as
allies
or
enemies
things
must
be
stirred
too
many
people
are
careless
of
who
he
stood
up
and
began
to
pace
the
floor
slowly
head
thrust
forward
a
little
hands
behind
him
listen
bergelin
i
will
be
wholly
frank
with
you
we
held
a
meeting
of
the
high
center
this
afternoon
following
the
rodvard
said
are
the
names
of
its
members
still
a
secret
except
for
yourself
mathurin
gave
a
snort
they
will
not
be
long
for
things
have
so
fallen
out
that
the
high
center
and
the
council
of
regency
will
be
one
you
will
have
guessed
that
brosen
zelitza
of
arjen
is
one
there
s
the
best
speaker
in
dossola
general
stegaller
he
s
in
charge
of
the
recruit
bureau
technically
but
is
really
organizing
what
will
be
a
people
s
army
it
may
surprise
you
to
know
that
your
old
friend
mme
kaja
is
a
member
a
wonderful
woman
for
handling
matters
of
detail
and
we
have
to
have
one
of
her
sex
because
of
our
position
about
the
art
but
i
could
wish
it
were
someone
beside
her
she
s
so
lalette
made
a
little
sound
rodvard
caught
sight
of
her
face
and
knew
she
was
about
to
burst
into
one
of
her
angers
will
no
one
tell
me
what
has
become
of
doctor
remigorius
he
asked
hoping
to
forestall
the
outburst
mathurin
s
pacing
stopped
i
forgive
you
and
will
tell
you
but
if
you
wish
health
you
will
not
mention
him
again
rat
spy
tool
he
has
fled
to
his
employer
prince
he
will
not
live
long
so
no
more
of
lalette
thought
these
are
the
creatures
round
my
husband
my
he
is
my
man
and
not
merely
using
me
and
my
blue
star
it
was
mathurin
began
but
before
he
had
finished
a
mouse
slipped
from
under
the
edge
of
the
bed
and
ran
rapidly
across
the
floor
as
though
on
tiny
wheels
slair
s
arm
flashed
up
and
out
with
the
scabbarded
sword
like
a
striking
bird
blade
and
beast
together
arrived
at
the
center
of
the
carpet
and
the
mouse
twitched
once
and
died
demadé
slair
picked
up
the
small
corpse
and
stood
looking
at
it
poor
creature
he
said
i
ask
your
pardon
now
your
children
in
the
hole
will
starve
for
lack
of
the
food
you
went
in
search
rodvard
was
astounded
to
see
a
tear
glitter
at
the
edge
of
the
swordsman
s
eye
ah
bah
said
mathurin
will
you
defend
vermin
slair
you
ll
have
use
enough
for
your
steel
when
the
new
decrees
are
rodvard
stirred
what
decrees
mathurin
turned
with
his
back
carefully
to
the
candles
rodvard
noted
so
that
his
face
was
dark
there
s
to
be
a
new
court
to
try
special
cases
it
was
what
i
was
about
to
mention
when
interrupted
treason
against
the
people
and
nation
you
will
be
writer
to
it
more
important
than
the
sessions
of
the
he
turned
to
lalette
there
is
also
a
part
for
you
you
are
one
of
the
keys
lalette
said
unhappily
in
what
way
as
versus
these
episcopals
they
spread
venom
represent
the
greatest
danger
we
now
have
to
face
pavinius
i
give
him
a
snap
of
the
fingers
he
is
too
nice
with
his
mayern
foreigners
and
western
herdsmen
the
tritulaccans
nothing
by
themselves
they
had
never
beaten
dossola
in
the
former
war
but
for
the
revolt
of
mancherei
mayern
help
and
the
treason
of
the
kjermanash
chieftains
the
court
now
sold
to
tritulacca
and
destitute
by
its
own
action
but
the
episcopals
are
still
not
out
of
credit
with
the
people
who
have
been
lulled
by
their
solemn
mummery
we
drove
them
from
the
assembly
of
the
nation
this
morning
good
but
now
they
may
join
tritulacca
in
the
name
of
what
they
call
true
but
what
have
i
to
do
with
the
episcopals
asked
the
girl
child
fool
use
your
art
not
to
the
death
they
d
only
fill
the
office
with
another
man
but
paralyze
cripple
drive
idiot
the
groadon
notably
his
loss
would
hurt
them
lalette
sat
up
ser
mathurin
you
do
not
by
any
means
understand
this
matter
of
the
art
groadon
is
protected
by
the
holy
oils
and
nothing
i
can
do
will
bite
on
it
is
you
that
do
not
understand
i
do
assure
you
that
if
groadon
be
taken
in
a
moment
of
anger
as
today
or
other
violent
passion
neither
his
oils
nor
any
other
thing
can
protect
him
from
your
ministrations
be
assured
we
will
provide
the
lalette
s
mouth
twitched
she
wanted
to
cry
not
for
any
reward
or
punishment
you
can
give
but
it
was
a
moment
before
she
said
am
i
the
in
dossola
mathurin
made
a
grating
sound
no
i
ll
be
open
we
are
pressing
the
search
have
found
three
from
those
who
claimed
the
art
but
could
witch
nothing
more
consequential
than
a
frog
or
chicken
one
is
an
old
beldame
who
has
nearly
lost
her
wits
and
can
be
made
to
understand
nothing
one
s
a
young
enough
but
never
taught
did
not
know
the
patterns
and
beside
she
ran
away
one
we
caught
not
was
in
chancellor
florestan
s
he
drew
a
finger
across
his
throat
none
of
them
heiress
to
a
blue
i
am
not
sure
i
can
follow
all
the
patterns
myself
said
lalette
i
have
used
the
mathurin
looked
at
her
sharply
hark
he
said
i
see
your
slowness
but
you
more
than
another
should
be
on
our
side
as
witch
and
woman
the
art
has
almost
died
out
driven
down
by
priest
and
episcopal
there
are
likely
many
with
the
right
inheritance
who
do
not
know
it
never
taught
yet
it
s
a
woman
s
defence
we
have
the
butler
tuolén
s
blue
star
for
instance
but
where
s
the
girl
can
bring
it
to
life
we
do
not
even
know
her
he
whirled
suddenly
and
flung
out
an
arm
toward
rodvard
in
an
oratorical
gesture
bergelin
i
remember
that
was
the
other
matter
you
were
in
the
office
of
pedigree
know
its
secrets
forget
the
great
assembly
for
the
time
that
s
under
control
until
the
new
court
s
set
up
your
task
is
seeking
out
tuolén
s
heiress
i
ll
give
you
an
it
may
be
somewhat
harder
than
you
think
said
rodvard
i
did
not
say
it
would
be
easy
i
said
it
would
be
done
said
mathurin
slair
let
us
ii
when
they
were
out
he
turned
to
look
at
lalette
she
had
sagged
down
with
her
face
in
the
pillow
and
now
without
moving
she
said
as
before
he
went
across
the
room
and
put
an
arm
around
her
what
is
it
my
mother
she
is
with
the
court
and
she
knows
the
patterns
if
that
man
takes
her
he
will
have
her
throat
the
fate
of
many
thousands
and
the
guarantee
of
the
future
with
the
art
not
in
the
hands
of
ignorant
peasants
but
women
of
intelligence
and
good
against
one
lie
but
how
to
say
it
he
said
has
she
shown
so
much
concern
for
you
lalette
twisted
under
his
arm
if
she
had
would
i
know
it
you
hold
me
a
and
your
remigorius
who
does
not
deliver
letters
and
your
mme
kaja
who
will
sell
me
and
your
mathurin
who
wants
to
cut
my
mother
s
throat
i
never
knew
what
dirt
was
till
i
knew
rodvard
felt
the
blood
beat
at
his
temples
he
wanted
to
strike
her
to
make
a
fiery
retort
he
released
her
stood
up
and
began
to
walk
the
floor
no
no
a
quarrel
so
entered
could
never
be
composed
look
beyond
it
rodvard
see
how
the
world
would
be
without
her
somewhere
perhaps
there
was
another
who
would
have
more
response
for
an
interior
fidelity
deeper
than
any
single
act
would
not
drive
him
from
her
side
with
bitter
words
when
he
thought
of
maritzl
of
stojenrosek
and
by
this
route
came
again
to
the
high
purpose
no
it
was
mere
selfishness
to
let
his
own
thought
his
own
problem
stand
first
the
very
thing
he
had
wished
to
bring
her
to
see
keep
the
peace
a
small
sound
made
him
turn
she
was
just
settling
into
place
among
the
covers
and
her
face
turned
toward
him
oh
rodvard
she
said
help
me
i
can
t
do
it
the
nothing
more
was
said
on
the
subject
but
that
night
they
slept
in
each
other
s
arms
the
court
of
special
cases
punctual
to
the
hour
as
rodvard
and
lalette
sat
at
breakfast
with
the
woman
who
cared
for
the
kitchen
and
a
green
islands
buyer
of
northern
wools
there
arrived
a
messenger
bearing
the
authority
signed
by
mathurin
to
consult
all
documents
and
registers
in
the
office
of
pedigree
even
those
hitherto
held
under
ecclesiastical
seal
for
lalette
also
a
note
the
had
declared
himself
in
seclusion
for
prayer
and
she
would
be
notified
further
between
them
that
morning
there
was
a
truce
to
contention
they
walked
for
a
while
in
the
gardens
among
dead
rustling
leaves
and
she
kissed
him
sweetly
when
he
left
on
the
way
to
the
office
of
pedigree
rodvard
thought
of
asper
poltén
and
the
rest
when
he
walked
in
with
an
authority
to
examine
the
sealed
registers
but
this
small
triumph
was
denied
him
poltén
was
nowhere
to
be
seen
and
in
the
distributing
office
was
only
an
old
dry
dusty
man
rodvard
remembered
as
having
seen
once
or
twice
with
some
document
close
to
his
nose
he
held
rodvard
s
paper
in
the
same
manner
sniffed
as
though
it
had
an
unpleasant
odor
and
shufflingly
led
the
way
to
the
sealed
which
he
unlocked
with
a
creaking
key
there
seemed
fewer
people
than
usual
in
the
halls
the
sealed
files
themselves
showed
the
search
likely
to
be
a
long
one
mostly
old
written
in
crabbed
hands
and
largely
concerned
with
the
illegitimacies
of
persons
now
forgotten
or
convictions
of
witchery
in
cases
that
now
had
no
meaning
of
the
specific
line
of
tuolén
there
was
no
trace
that
morning
and
the
older
records
of
families
having
kjermanash
blood
were
so
badly
kept
as
to
indicate
a
long
search
at
noon
rodvard
went
to
a
tavern
and
lingered
over
his
mug
to
savor
the
gossip
of
the
town
but
that
was
something
of
a
failure
too
for
there
was
none
of
the
high
excitement
over
the
doings
of
the
great
assembly
he
had
expected
the
only
group
he
overheard
specifically
were
three
or
four
merchants
at
a
table
rather
gloomily
discussing
the
rise
in
the
price
of
wool
caused
by
the
troubles
in
the
west
and
the
fall
in
the
price
of
southern
wine
which
kept
coming
in
from
oversea
and
could
not
be
dispatched
to
the
disturbed
seignories
nobody
said
a
word
about
the
episcopals
the
only
time
the
court
was
mentioned
there
was
a
little
growling
over
the
name
of
florestan
in
the
afternoon
rodvard
began
by
setting
aside
the
registers
that
had
to
do
with
the
three
northernmost
seignories
bregatz
vivensteg
and
oltrug
but
the
task
was
so
wearisome
and
his
mind
so
occupied
with
other
topics
that
he
put
them
away
early
it
seemed
to
him
as
he
summoned
the
caretaker
to
lock
the
room
that
there
was
nothing
in
the
world
as
dear
or
desirable
as
lalette
if
he
could
only
somehow
reach
an
agreement
with
her
all
troubles
would
vanish
away
as
he
walked
back
toward
the
ulutz
palace
he
thought
that
if
they
could
only
sit
down
in
the
clear
winter
air
after
last
night
s
storm
all
coils
would
be
unwoven
but
she
was
not
in
the
room
when
he
arrived
and
when
he
found
her
it
was
on
a
bench
among
the
garden
alleys
wrapped
in
a
cloak
and
laughing
as
she
talked
to
demadé
slair
the
swordsman
leaped
up
at
his
coming
hail
dauntless
dompter
of
the
written
page
he
said
in
a
tone
which
was
that
of
banter
between
friends
but
with
something
in
it
that
made
rodvard
look
sharply
at
the
eyes
clear
as
speech
the
thought
came
through
and
this
booby
who
has
never
handled
a
weapon
in
his
life
will
lie
with
her
tonight
while
i
m
rodvard
said
a
little
unevenly
i
have
made
a
beginning
are
there
any
tidings
not
in
the
assembly
said
slair
much
discussion
of
how
to
raise
troops
for
the
people
s
army
and
a
report
by
general
stegaller
the
decree
for
your
my
court
said
rodvard
thinking
of
the
queen
that
of
judgment
in
special
the
eyes
had
gone
blank
you
ll
be
writer
to
it
as
mathurin
to
the
assembly
if
there
s
anyone
you
have
a
grudge
against
name
him
for
he
laughed
so
did
lalette
and
as
rodvard
caught
her
eye
he
saw
in
it
a
color
of
regret
that
he
could
not
be
as
gay
as
the
swordsman
and
a
wave
of
dislike
for
the
man
who
had
rescued
him
from
charalkis
prison
contracted
his
veins
i
think
i
saw
in
the
library
a
book
by
momoroso
that
i
have
never
read
he
said
i
will
see
you
before
table
ii
the
session
will
recess
said
the
kronzlar
escholl
he
rose
and
swept
the
courtroom
with
his
curious
lacklustre
eye
that
never
seemed
to
be
settled
on
anything
i
will
go
over
the
evidence
with
you
the
legist
on
his
right
the
zigraner
frowned
he
on
the
left
leaned
his
chin
on
his
hand
and
his
elbow
on
the
table
the
accused
a
man
with
a
coronet
badge
hair
and
heavy
dewlaps
looked
disconcerted
rodvard
gathered
his
papers
and
followed
the
president
of
the
court
to
the
little
room
in
rear
when
they
were
there
what
have
you
found
asked
the
legist
i
think
he
tells
the
truth
said
rodvard
when
he
says
he
has
given
no
help
to
the
queen
s
party
or
pavinius
when
you
asked
him
that
however
there
was
something
like
for
his
brother
it
was
not
the
legist
placed
his
fingers
together
and
studied
them
bergelin
he
said
after
a
moment
you
are
to
remember
that
this
is
a
special
court
of
inquiry
we
are
empowered
to
handle
not
only
direct
treasons
but
matters
which
the
ordinary
law
holds
criminal
such
acts
dissipate
the
resources
that
of
right
belong
to
the
nation
you
tend
to
be
narrow
let
us
as
they
came
in
one
of
the
guards
nudged
the
prisoner
forward
again
the
jurist
president
frowned
on
him
portentously
kettersel
he
said
a
brief
examination
of
the
record
shows
no
evidence
of
your
giving
aid
to
either
of
the
two
destituted
persons
who
claim
to
rule
the
realm
of
dossola
unless
my
disagree
of
that
you
are
he
glanced
at
one
and
the
other
the
zigraner
gave
a
somewhat
unwilling
nod
the
third
legist
had
only
an
absent
expression
but
in
pleading
innocence
of
giving
such
aid
you
are
answering
a
charge
that
has
never
been
brought
if
you
say
you
are
not
guilty
of
garroting
people
by
night
in
king
crotinianus
square
we
will
find
you
innocent
of
that
also
and
so
through
a
list
of
possible
crimes
did
it
not
waste
this
court
s
time
to
agree
with
you
that
you
have
committed
none
of
them
but
you
are
charged
with
treason
to
the
nation
which
in
its
essence
consists
not
of
any
specific
act
but
of
a
point
of
view
which
may
be
proved
by
a
number
of
actions
in
themselves
bearing
an
innocent
appearance
until
they
are
assembled
with
each
other
i
take
it
my
he
looked
again
and
again
those
in
the
lower
seats
nodded
kettersel
he
said
answer
me
you
have
a
brother
with
the
court
the
man
cleared
his
throat
i
have
answered
that
he
is
a
capellan
in
the
eagle
shar
of
her
majesty
s
the
shadow
of
worry
was
behind
the
man
s
eye
now
deepened
and
very
surprising
in
such
a
person
whom
one
would
have
expected
to
be
concerned
about
gold
scudi
or
the
fidelity
of
his
mistress
the
nation
s
lancers
corrected
escholl
kettersel
are
both
you
and
your
brother

only
him
the
has
he
daughters
no
only
a
if
your
brother
should
fall
in
the
fighting
where
would
the
inheritance
lie
now
the
fear
was
at
the
front
and
perfectly
sharp
it
was
a
fear
of
being
left
penniless
kettersel
said
slowly
and
lying
i
am
not
sure
would
have
to
consult
the
office
of
pedigree
there
is
a
cousin
i
think
to
whom
the
income
would
fall
the
title
and
the
estate
would
pass
to
the
son
of
how
old
is
the
i
the
jurist
president
moved
his
lips
and
rodvard
observed
that
the
man
before
him
was
perspiring
with
the
effort
to
keep
some
thought
down
a
thought
which
came
to
the
watcher
dark
as
sin
and
midnight
is
your
nephew
married
to
one
of
the
blenau
rodvard
signed
without
appearing
to
see
him
the
jurist
president
said
kettersel
you
are
engaged
in
concealments
it
is
useless
what
is
the
trouble
between
you
and
your
nephew
the
man
s
split
apart
suddenly
he
flung
at
rodvard
a
glance
of
purest
venom
and
burst
out
the
damned
young
puppy
is
trying
to
have
his
own
father
killed
so
he
may
have
the
title
for
his
whore
of
a
wife
there
is
no
reason
none
at
all
why
he
should
take
a
command
in
the
eagle
shar
he
is
an
old
man
taking
the
task
of
that
young
bastard
in
the
lancers
where
all
the
fighting
there
was
a
little
murmur
in
the
courtroom
the
jurist
president
said
why
did
he
accept
the
charge
it
was
the
wrong
line
kettersel
s
eyes
were
perfectly
clear
to
spare
his
son
i
suppose
my
nephew
was
appointed
rodvard
coughed
kronzlar
escholl
said
where
are
your
nephew
and
his
wife
now
the
man
paused
and
in
that
pause
the
thing
came
through
it
took
rodvard
a
minute
or
two
to
realize
what
it
was
i
heard
of
them
last
at
rodvard
stepped
up
to
the
jurist
s
seat
with
one
finger
on
the
paper
to
maintain
the
fiction
and
whispered
his
true
concern
is
not
his
brother
but
because
he
wishes
to
lie
with
his
nephew
s
wife
i
think
she
may
have
refused
him
but
he
still
believes
it
may
be
done
somehow
if
the
nephew
can
be
killed
before
his
escholl
put
a
finger
beside
rodvard
s
that
is
correct
after
all
and
turned
to
the
prisoner
kettersel
your
concern
for
your
brother
does
you
the
greatest
credit
it
is
evident
that
you
have
been
in
correspondence
with
him
but
i
think
my
brother
jurists
will
agree
when
i
pronounce
you
guiltless
of
true
treason
and
order
your
the
two
jurists
wagged
their
heads
silently
and
in
unison
like
those
toys
with
flexible
necks
which
children
play
with
during
the
winter
festival
we
will
hear
the
next
winter
light
as
rodvard
left
the
courtroom
demadé
slair
fell
into
step
beside
him
the
man
was
determinedly
if
coldly
friendly
how
to
shake
him
off
instead
of
leading
him
home
to
lalette
and
another
of
those
conversations
in
three
where
rodvard
felt
himself
so
much
hearing
a
language
he
did
not
understand
that
he
always
ultimately
fled
them
for
a
book
or
the
outer
air
escholl
is
one
of
our
best
said
the
swordsman
kicking
at
the
skin
of
a
fruit
but
there
s
a
judgment
i
failed
to
which
one
the
merchant
who
was
confiscated
for
bringing
past
the
mayern
camp
ah
bah
no
he
had
money
the
nation
needs
it
that
s
crime
enough
i
spoke
of
the
baron
s
brother
the
noble
no
more
did
i
understand
it
said
rodvard
as
dirty
a
character
as
i
ever
saw
but
the
kronzlar
let
him
go
and
praised
oho
said
slair
it
begins
to
come
clear
what
s
the
tale
why
he
was
after
his
nephew
s
for
her
money
or
her
body
the
most
i
am
not
sure
but
he
wants
he
could
not
resist
adding
and
it
s
a
poor
task
to
break
up
a
couple
at
any
time
for
it
destroys
two
people
s
chance
of
happiness
for
the
temporary
pleasure
of
not
always
said
slair
avoiding
his
eyes
but
i
am
interrupting
is
there
more
his
only
fear
is
that
the
baron
will
die
before
the
son
and
so
the
right
of
remarrying
the
girl
will
pass
to
another
family
i
did
not
tell
the
kronzlar
because
it
was
not
clear
enough
but
i
think
he
was
planning
murder
yet
escholl
let
him
slair
laughed
bergelin
he
said
do
not
lose
your
innocence
it
may
save
your
life
some
day
for
no
one
will
ever
believe
you
are
subtle
enough
to
be
dangerous
i
said
escholl
was
one
of
our
best
depend
upon
it
he
thought
more
deeply
than
you
and
without
any
to
help
him
why
it
is
precisely
because
kettersel
has
murder
and
rape
at
the
back
of
his
mind
that
he
was
let
go
for
exactly
the
opposite
reason
the
court
will
condemn
palm
as
soon
as
there
s
a
pretext
for
a
trial
mathurin
has
arranged
it
i
am
innocent
again
and
do
not
quite
understand
the
yet
you
will
dabble
in
high
politic
hark
now
are
not
all
of
the
noble
order
enemies
to
the
new
day
by
constitution
by
existence
are
not
all
their
private
virtues
overwhelmed
by
this
public
fault
the
true
villains
among
them
will
sooner
or
later
dig
their
own
graves
and
save
us
the
trouble
bringing
discredit
on
the
whole
in
the
process
but
when
you
have
one
like
palm
or
the
late
baron
brunivar
he
s
dangerous
sets
people
to
loving
the
institution
because
they
can
not
hate
the
man
and
so
must
be
pulled
down
by
force
for
that
matter
we
need
something
to
stir
the
people
make
them
fight
for
their
this
seems
a
hard
way
said
rodvard
trying
to
resolve
the
torsion
in
his
mind
it
is
a
hard
life
and
hardest
for
those
who
avoid
battle
said
demadé
slair
and
rodvard
not
replying
they
walked
in
silence
would
this
new
system
somehow
produce
men
of
better
heart
and
purpose
for
he
did
not
see
how
the
hardness
could
be
justified
else
and
now
his
mind
fell
to
wagging
between
and
he
decided
that
the
justification
of
the
system
would
be
that
it
produced
better
men
generally
and
not
merely
a
few
of
the
best
no
not
that
either
for
that
was
to
confuse
politic
with
ethic
and
each
was
itself
a
system
for
the
one
would
make
men
good
without
regard
to
their
happiness
and
the
other
make
them
happy
without
regard
to
their
good
or
what
was
good
where
was
the
standard
by
the
system
of
will
you
go
on
to
the
quays
said
slair
s
voice
suddenly
and
rodvard
found
himself
three
steps
beyond
the
entrance
to
the
palace
ulutz
i
am
weary
tonight
said
rodvard
perhaps
because
i
am
so
innocent
that
this
affair
of
spying
upon
the
minds
of
my
fellows
is
somewhat
he
extended
his
hand
to
bid
goodnight
oh
i
am
going
with
you
said
the
swordsman
and
as
he
caught
rodvard
s
glance
of
aversion
i
can
not
bear
to
be
without
your
his
face
went
sober
as
he
beside
rodvard
s
dragging
feet
up
the
this
is
mathurin
s
arrangement
also
in
case
it
troubles
you
did
you
not
notice
those
two
men
who
followed
us
from
the
court
at
half
a
square
s
distance
there
will
be
another
outside
tonight
people
s
a
tremor
of
peril
but
i
done
nothing
but
your
duty
to
the
nation
true
and
for
that
reason
precisely
it
is
needful
to
guard
you
like
an
egg
sought
after
by
weasels
do
you
think
that
the
fact
you
bear
a
blue
star
is
a
secret
there
are
not
a
few
persons
who
may
be
brought
before
the
court
that
would
rather
conceal
an
assassination
than
what
they
have
in
their
minds
you
and
i
may
have
a
fight
on
our
his
face
lighted
with
pleasure
at
the
prospect
ii
they
paced
slowly
through
the
dead
garden
along
a
walk
so
narrow
that
shoulders
sometimes
touched
lalette
could
hear
the
tiny
tinkle
of
the
chain
that
bound
slair
s
sword
to
his
hip
when
that
touch
came
she
knew
he
was
stirred
and
the
rousing
of
emotion
was
not
unpleasant
to
her
beyond
the
slate
roofs
of
the
town
the
sun
was
sinking
redly
through
striations
of
cloud
all
things
lay
in
a
peace
that
was
the
peace
of
the
end
of
the
world
he
turned
his
head
demoiselle
he
said
what
will
you
give
for
news
oh
hush
said
she
you
spoil
it
for
a
moment
i
was
i
ask
your
grace
but
truly
i
have
news
for
you
and
it
should
please
sit
here
and
tell
she
took
her
place
on
a
marble
bench
beneath
the
skeleton
of
an
espaliered
peach
against
the
wall
you
will
not
have
to
use
your
art
against
the
groadon
does
that
not
please
you
more
than
you
know
what
is
the
reason
he
has
fled
slipped
through
the
watch
set
on
his
palace
and
to
hell
the
court
or
tritulacca
no
one
i
am
she
looked
straight
before
her
for
a
moment
ah
if
things
were
better
you
are
not
as
pleased
as
you
might
oh
i
am
but
what
has
he
done
i
oh
it
s
no
fault
of
his
you
will
tell
no
one
she
laid
a
cold
hand
on
his
warm
one
he
has
found
who
the
heiress
of
tuolén
is
but
does
not
know
whether
to
tell
mathurin
or
who
is
she
a
child
thirteen
years
old
she
lives
at
dyolana
up
in
oltrug
seignory
but
i
do
not
know
how
long
rodvard
will
keep
the
secret
he
feels
a
sense
of
why
should
he
not
what
withholds
him
from
telling
i
would
have
to
teach
her
the
patterns
and
everything
i
do
not
wish
she
shivered
slightly
and
to
be
a
the
rising
shades
had
drowned
the
sun
a
silence
came
on
the
garden
so
utter
that
lalette
felt
she
could
hear
her
own
heart
beat
and
demadé
slair
s
beside
her
the
trees
stood
straight
the
ruins
of
the
flowers
did
not
stir
in
that
enchanted
stillness
she
seemed
to
float
without
power
of
motion
he
leaned
toward
her
his
arm
close
against
her
back
his
other
hand
crept
over
her
two
he
said
in
a
voice
so
low
it
did
not
break
the
quiet
i
love
you
come
away
with
her
head
shook
slowly
tears
gathered
behind
the
eyes
the
arm
around
her
back
slid
slowly
beneath
her
own
arm
the
hand
groped
to
close
slowly
around
one
soft
breast
as
though
it
were
by
no
volition
of
her
own
her
head
came
back
to
meet
the
kiss
the
tears
ran
down
her
cheek
to
touch
his
he
drew
from
her
and
began
to
speak
rapidly
in
a
voice
low
and
urgent
come
with
me
i
will
take
you
away
from
every
unhappiness
we
can
go
beyond
finding
i
am
a
fighting
man
can
find
a
need
for
my
service
anywhere
it
does
not
matter
we
can
forget
all
this
entanglement
and
make
our
own
world
i
have
money
enough
we
can
go
to
the
green
islands
and
you
will
never
have
to
use
the
art
again
oh
lalette
i
would
even
take
you
to
the
court
and
join
your
mother
do
you
wish
it
her
lips
barely
moving
she
said
and
rodvard
he
kissed
her
again
bergelin
you
owe
him
nothing
what
has
he
done
for
you
and
now
he
will
tell
mathurin
about
the
heiress
of
tuolén
and
there
will
be
no
more
place
for
with
me
i
will
always
have
a
place
for
you
lalette
now
or
a
thousand
years
from
now
or
do
you
fear
him
i
am
the
better
now
her
eyes
opened
wide
on
the
first
star
low
in
the
darkening
sky
and
with
one
hand
she
gently
disengaged
his
clasp
from
her
breast
no
she
said
in
a
voice
clearer
than
before
no
demadé
i
can
not
perhaps
for
that
reason
but
i
can
not
we
had
better
go
in
iii
friend
friend
the
voice
from
brought
back
to
a
consciousness
of
unhappiness
the
mind
that
had
lost
itself
in
the
sweet
cadences
and
imagined
worlds
of
momoroso
rodvard
sprang
up
and
threw
open
the
door
what
will
you
have
someone
to
see
down
the
hall
another
door
closed
it
would
be
the
little
old
man
who
asked
so
many
questions
and
went
almost
as
though
always
prepared
to
look
through
a
keyhole
from
the
stairhead
rodvard
could
see
in
the
evening
s
first
shades
a
figure
covered
with
a
long
cloak
somehow
familiar
but
the
face
hooded
over
beg
her
to
come
up
he
called
the
figure
mounted
with
one
hand
on
the
bannister
in
the
slow
manner
of
the
old
near
the
last
step
his
mind
clicked
he
was
not
surprised
when
in
the
room
the
hood
fell
back
to
show
mme
kaja
face
cold
as
ice
he
remained
standing
she
came
across
the
room
in
a
whirl
of
skirts
with
both
hands
out
my
boy
she
said
with
the
hangings
at
the
windows
it
was
too
dim
to
tell
how
far
her
sincerity
went
i
am
more
than
honored
to
have
one
of
the
he
said
and
let
it
hang
oh
you
are
the
most
necessary
of
all
she
said
and
to
the
best
chair
i
hope
you
have
forgiven
me
it
was
necessary
someone
had
filed
an
information
with
the
provosts
that
i
was
part
of
the
new
day
and
it
was
such
a
help
isn
t
it
bad
about
the
episcopals
not
cooperating
but
there
are
so
many
of
the
priests
on
our
she
had
seated
herself
where
her
face
was
in
the
shadow
madame
why
have
you
come
he
asked
brutally
there
was
a
silence
in
the
darkening
room
then
to
help
you
said
the
voice
that
though
it
might
no
longer
sing
had
not
lost
its
silver
in
speech
i
will
make
a
she
stirred
do
not
it
is
better
so
i
are
thinking
of
the
blue
star
do
you
imagine
that
i
fear
your
using
it
he
sat
quietly
noting
with
the
back
of
his
mind
how
the
dubious
nicety
had
dropped
from
her
voice
and
thinking
that
this
was
the
woman
who
had
been
taken
into
the
high
center
once
more
she
seemed
to
gather
her
forces
rodvard
bergelin
she
said
do
you
know
why
i
am
in
the
high
center
i
think
i
will
tell
you
it
may
be
that
in
my
ancestry
there
is
a
strain
from
one
of
the
it
may
be
because
i
sincerely
serve
god
i
do
not
know
but
it
has
been
given
to
me
to
be
able
to
trace
certain
secrets
of
the
her
multitudinous
bracelets
jingled
as
she
lifted
a
hand
to
her
breast
not
as
you
do
with
the
blue
she
was
silent
again
and
he
unable
to
restrain
an
impulse
toward
malice
said
your
success
in
understanding
remigorius
great
as
my
rodvard
you
are
she
dropped
for
a
moment
into
the
old
manner
then
seemed
to
shake
herself
i
know
will
never
forgive
me
not
that
i
brought
the
provosts
but
that
i
came
in
that
day
when
you
were
on
the
bed
i
do
not
care
she
brings
an
evil
art
into
our
new
do
you
think
so
rodvard
hear
me
this
witch
to
whom
you
are
affected
will
one
day
be
the
end
of
you
i
have
seen
her
but
little
yet
i
is
your
nature
to
give
offense
and
hers
to
take
it
sooner
or
later
it
will
happen
that
she
will
find
something
not
to
be
borne
and
put
a
witchery
on
you
that
will
strike
like
this
clipped
him
close
with
a
certain
convulsion
round
the
heart
he
remembered
lalette
s
occasional
sudden
rages
well
he
said
what
would
you
have
me
do
bid
her
farewell
both
of
you
can
find
partners
better
rodvard
came
to
his
feet
and
walked
across
the
room
slowly
thinking
in
little
flashes
of
sweet
leece
and
maritzl
of
stojenrosek
mme
kaja
sat
immobile
no
he
said
better
or
worse
i
will
not
give
her
up
for
mme
kaja
also
stood
forgive
an
old
woman
she
said
and
gathering
her
cloak
around
her
slipped
out
the
door
embers
revived
we
will
hear
the
next
case
said
the
kronzlar
escholl
the
people
s
guard
opened
the
door
to
the
room
of
the
accused
and
called
bring
her
in
while
a
countryman
stepped
forward
from
the
rear
of
the
court
two
more
guards
behind
him
the
countryman
had
a
merchant
s
badge
and
so
quick
an
eye
that
rodvard
gazed
at
him
fascinated
to
see
what
it
would
tell
and
was
therefore
unprepared
when
he
turned
his
head
to
see
the
accused
it
was
maritzl
of
stojenrosek
a
maritzl
pale
behind
her
red
lips
still
even
when
she
moved
and
much
changed
how
rodvard
asked
himself
and
could
find
no
answer
but
in
a
certain
lessening
of
fibre
that
was
expressed
around
the
mouth
though
the
breathtaking
thrill
of
her
presence
was
still
so
much
there
that
he
swallowed
the
prosecutor
stepped
forward
i
present
an
accusation
of
treason
against
the
nation
on
the
part
of
the
demoiselle
maritzl
of
stojenrosek
mistress
of
count
cleudi
the
foreign
traitor
i
call
the
innkeeper
of
mistress
of
count
cleudi
and
drog
the
man
stood
forth
maritzl
turned
to
look
at
him
and
as
her
eyes
turned
back
they
fell
on
rodvard
she
started
and
before
she
looked
down
again
he
caught
from
them
an
arrow
of
purest
and
most
astounding
hatred
tell
us
your
story
said
the
jurist
president
i
keep
a
good
house
said
the
man
twisting
his
cap
in
his
hands
and
i
have
to
be
careful
to
preserve
its
reputation
the
prosecutor
touched
his
arm
give
your
condition
head
bobbed
thank
you
friend
i
am
keeper
of
the
inn
star
of
dossola
at
drog
on
the
road
through
the
pass
of
pikes
in
the
ragged
mountains
and
mine
is
the
largest
inn
there
with
three
upper
rooms
beside
the
general
maritzl
was
looking
at
him
again
not
now
with
hatred
but
weariness
of
the
world
and
the
thought
that
he
rodvard
was
as
dreary
as
any
part
of
it
it
has
never
been
necessary
for
the
provosts
to
come
to
my
place
except
when
i
called
them
now
when
this
woman
came
into
my
inn
i
knew
right
away
that
something
was
wrong
late
at
night
it
was
and
she
in
a
coach
with
a
driver
and
that
seemed
the
prosecutor
halted
him
again
explain
why
you
thought
something
was
look
at
her
she
comes
evidently
from
the
court
and
bears
the
marks
of
he
jabbed
a
finger
at
the
girl
but
it
was
rodvard
she
looked
at
a
long
slow
glance
in
which
was
some
decision
to
make
a
desperate
appeal
when
i
saw
her
i
think
to
myself
as
a
man
often
will
that
this
is
not
the
place
for
a
court
woman
to
be
not
with
the
court
in
zenss
so
i
think
this
is
a
good
one
to
watch
and
perhaps
i
will
learn
something
and
while
she
is
sat
apart
from
the
coachmaster
in
the
high
dining
room
she
she
was
supping
i
served
her
myself
and
marked
how
there
was
a
little
casket
she
kept
beside
herself
and
touched
her
hand
to
even
while
she
was
her
face
now
outwardly
held
the
appeal
but
a
plan
was
building
in
her
mind
he
could
see
it
grow
stone
by
stone
but
not
clearly
what
it
was
because
little
kept
jagging
across
the
picture
so
i
said
to
her
that
if
her
casket
was
that
precious
i
ought
to
hold
it
in
the
strongbox
of
the
inn
there
being
so
many
wandering
soldiers
about
when
i
said
this
her
he
grinned
a
vulpine
grin
to
show
this
was
intended
for
a
joke
no
she
would
as
soon
lose
her
life
as
the
casket
which
being
so
small
i
think
it
must
have
in
it
something
beside
jewels
so
i
said
to
myself
here
is
some
mystery
but
if
anyone
can
unlock
it
it
is
my
friend
khlab
that
was
a
provost
of
the
court
at
sedad
vix
till
it
was
broken
up
so
while
her
ladyship
was
at
the
dessert
i
slipped
out
to
find
my
friend
khlab
and
let
him
walk
past
the
door
to
look
at
her
the
minute
he
saw
one
moment
said
the
prosecutor
and
addressed
the
court
i
present
the
former
provost
khlab
now
a
people
s
he
motioned
to
a
man
behind
who
took
the
innkeeper
s
place
tell
your
yes
i
saw
her
through
the
door
as
i
went
past
and
i
knew
her
at
once
for
maritzl
of
stojenrosek
because
i
had
seen
her
before
she
is
the
one
count
cleudi
brought
to
sedad
vix
to
be
his
mistress
after
the
spring
festival
i
told
this
to
friend
brezel
and
he
said
if
she
was
as
close
as
that
to
cleudi
she
had
no
business
in
drog
so
we
went
in
and
under
pain
of
the
sword
made
her
give
up
the
casket
it
had
some
jewels
in
it
but
underneath
the
lining
was
the
the
letter
is
here
said
the
prosecutor
handing
up
a
parchment
partly
torn
but
bearing
the
unmistakable
blue
star
seal
it
is
a
document
already
famous
in
which
cleudi
beseeches
the
aid
of
the
tritulaccans
in
return
for
cessions
of
territory
most
treasonable
said
kronzlar
escholl
looking
at
it
as
though
he
had
never
seen
it
before
the
zigraner
jurist
craned
his
neck
her
plan
was
complete
now
she
took
one
step
forward
and
in
a
low
urgent
whisper
said
rodvard
help
it
was
an
entreaty
and
as
though
she
knew
of
the
use
of
the
jewel
she
was
projecting
a
promise
behind
the
entreaty
and
the
plan
was
behind
the
promise
but
it
was
as
though
that
help
me
laid
a
compulsion
on
him
rodvard
turned
round
as
escholl
was
handing
the
parchment
to
the
third
jurist
your
pardon
a
frown
very
well
i
will
see
rodvard
stepped
to
the
bench
and
whispered
she
is
thinking
of
some
sort
of
plan
i
do
not
know
for
what
i
think
i
could
find
out
if
i
could
question
her
alone
i
knew
her
in
the
old
i
escholl
addressed
the
court
this
is
perhaps
the
foulest
piece
of
treason
in
the
history
of
dossola
and
we
have
proof
that
the
message
is
no
forgery
in
the
recent
march
of
the
tritulaccan
shars
over
the
southern
border
and
the
delivery
to
them
without
a
battle
of
the
castle
of
falsteg
it
is
evident
that
the
accused
had
full
knowledge
of
the
contents
of
this
letter
and
is
therefore
guilty
of
taking
part
in
a
vile
conspiracy
against
the
nation
but
this
court
is
required
to
follow
every
treason
to
its
source
not
merely
to
establish
individual
guilts
we
will
postpone
this
matter
for
inquiry
and
pass
to
the
next
ii
rodvard
sprang
up
as
she
was
led
into
the
room
hurrying
to
get
her
one
of
the
comfortless
chairs
from
the
row
against
the
wall
the
guard
leered
at
him
with
a
thought
so
nasty
that
rodvard
s
tongue
stumbled
as
he
said
she
wants
me
something
in
the
guard
laughed
glanced
at
the
barred
window
and
slammed
the
door
maritzl
said
rodvard
i
do
not
want
to
go
to
the
what
can
i
do
said
he
her
hands
clenched
fingers
entwined
in
fingers
take
me
away
you
are
the
writer
to
this
court
can
you
not
make
an
order
or
something
for
my
release
to
be
transported
elsewhere
this
was
the
plan
but
it
was
not
the
whole
plan
and
yet
under
the
magic
of
her
presence
the
words
seemed
to
count
more
than
what
lay
behind
them
would
be
very
difficult
he
said
the
order
would
have
to
be
countersigned
and
you
are
a
writer
a
note
of
scorn
in
her
voice
you
should
forge
the
signature
why
not
this
regency
of
yours
is
hopeless
i
have
been
confined
but
even
i
know
that
how
many
shar
of
soldiers
do
you
order
enough
to
fight
the
court
and
all
tritulacca
now
it
was
rodvard
s
turn
to
be
uneasy
for
he
had
asked
himself
these
questions
the
people
will
rise
he
said
have
they
risen
yet
where
are
their
weapons
how
many
leaders
do
you
have
who
can
set
a
battle
in
order
pavinius
will
never
fight
with
the
tritulaccans
they
ll
now
genuine
black
anger
jutted
from
her
eyes
all
you
can
do
here
in
this
little
is
lay
the
ground
for
vengeance
on
she
was
near
enough
to
reach
out
a
hand
and
touch
him
take
me
away
i
do
not
want
to
go
to
the
and
i
do
not
want
you
to
and
you
would
have
me
betray
her
eyes
flashed
a
resolve
before
he
could
say
more
she
was
out
of
her
chair
arms
around
his
shoulders
cheek
caressing
his
head
ah
rodvard
i
will
make
it
up
to
he
stood
up
in
the
circle
of
her
arms
her
head
tilted
back
the
long
lashes
lying
on
her
cheek
over
veiled
eyes
mistake
he
thought
a
sudden
rivulet
of
cold
running
down
his
spine
it
can
not
be
true
you
were
hating
me
a
moment
ago
i
think
i
see
your
plan
now
he
held
her
off
with
rough
hands
on
her
shoulders
you
are
cleudi
s
mistress
he
said
the
liquid
flesh
changed
to
brass
the
eyes
snapped
open
as
she
shook
herself
free
yes
i
am
cleudi
s
mistress
she
cried
and
whose
fault
is
it
i
was
a
good
girl
once
i
would
have
given
you
everything
and
remained
good
no
matter
what
i
did
for
you
you
did
not
want
she
was
down
in
the
chair
again
crying
through
her
fingers
you
are
too
much
like
him
she
said
and
he
wrung
by
the
thought
of
that
fair
neck
delivered
to
the
executioner
laid
a
hand
on
her
shoulder
and
said
i
will
do
what
i
now
kronzlar
escholl
must
be
persuaded
if
possible
that
though
there
had
been
treason
it
was
treason
done
for
love
and
could
be
passed
over
iii
rodvard
came
in
late
and
had
had
no
supper
save
some
bread
and
cheese
caught
at
an
inn
with
the
two
people
s
guards
who
accompanied
him
demadé
slair
having
left
long
before
lalette
was
arranging
her
hair
before
the
mirror
with
a
candle
on
either
side
and
did
not
turn
round
at
the
sight
of
her
lifted
graceful
arms
a
wave
of
tenderness
swept
over
him
lalette
he
said
almost
lilting
the
word
good
she
still
did
not
turn
and
the
voice
was
formal
he
hurried
across
the
room
in
long
steps
and
turned
her
around
what
has
happened
there
was
an
impatient
movement
don
t
you
will
spoil
my
hair
lalette
there
is
something
tell
she
kept
her
eyes
away
from
him
nothing
and
then
as
he
merely
stood
waiting
in
burning
intensity
a
small
thing
truly
you
need
not
be
troubled
only
i
know
now
who
it
was
you
were
unfaithful
to
me
he
was
hot
and
cold
together
who
says
i
was
unfaithful
will
you
come
with
me
now
she
quoted
rodvard
you
may
be
able
to
read
some
of
my
thoughts
but
do
not
forget
why
is
she
a
witch
too
she
must
be
or
my
blue
star
that
i
lent
you
would
be
dead
or
did
she
give
you
another
before
you
shared
her
with
count
cleudi
she
wanted
to
hurt
him
as
she
had
been
hurt
to
make
him
regret
and
feel
that
no
regret
in
any
fashion
could
replace
what
had
been
lost
shared
her
with
count
cleudi
he
could
feel
honest
indignation
now
lalette
who
are
you
talking
about
i
am
glad
you
saved
her
life
said
she
still
not
looking
at
him
it
is
a
pity
my
hair
is
dark
and
my
skin
muddy
when
these
troubles
are
over
you
can
have
a
good
time
with
her
on
the
estate
it
is
in
zada
isn
t
it
the
indignation
no
longer
needed
to
be
pushed
all
he
could
think
of
was
how
he
had
rejected
the
shell
of
that
maritzl
once
desired
he
said
lalette
i
swear
to
you
that
i
have
never
been
with
maritzl
of
stojenrosek
if
that
is
the
one
you
mean
i
swear
that
i
never
will
i
don
t
even
want
the
accent
of
sincerity
was
making
her
doubt
but
the
bitterness
persisted
beneath
she
had
only
lost
the
line
somewhere
and
was
not
yet
ready
to
release
him
if
you
are
really
in
love
with
her
you
may
go
only
i
ll
not
be
one
of
he
was
invaded
by
despair
of
making
her
understand
with
or
without
the
fullest
tale
of
the
maid
damaris
and
the
witch
of
kazmerga
why
he
cried
it
would
seem
to
me
that
it
is
asked
of
any
pair
who
live
together
to
protect
each
other
from
casual
contacts
by
one
means
or
another
but
this
is
merely
not
true
will
you
listen
to
every
talebearer
who
tries
to
split
us
apart
for
reasons
of
his
own
she
lowered
her
head
melting
a
little
knowing
he
knew
of
demadé
slair
s
desire
if
not
of
her
own
temptation
there
are
some
tales
you
might
have
borne
to
me
yourself
instead
of
letting
me
learn
them
by
hazard
why
did
you
betray
me
by
telling
mathurin
of
the
child
of
dyolana
tuolén
s
heiress
now
he
took
her
strongly
by
the
shoulders
lalette
he
said
i
never
told
him
you
accuse
me
of
being
liar
and
betrayer
do
you
think
i
am
a
fool
as
well
if
mathurin
knows
of
her
he
has
learned
it
through
some
other
source
you
are
the
only
one
i
suddenly
and
dreadfully
she
knew
where
that
other
source
night
in
the
garden
when
she
herself
told
demadé
slair
mathurin
s
voice
and
sword
she
moved
close
putting
both
arms
around
him
in
a
convulsive
gesture
oh
rodvard
she
said
i
am
afraid
he
is
having
her
brought
here
and
will
make
her
a
witch
little
she
began
to
cry
then
that
night
as
they
sought
and
received
from
each
other
whatever
comfort
passion
could
give
she
touched
him
and
said
it
is
true
i
am
a
witch
and
your
partner
the
great
no
and
yes
you
helped
me
so
much
before
said
lalette
the
widow
domijaiek
contemplated
her
tranquilly
from
among
the
husks
of
characters
who
never
lived
yet
you
are
again
in
need
of
the
myonessae
i
could
you
could
not
give
up
the
desires
of
this
false
material
world
for
the
god
of
love
however
it
is
not
necessary
to
agree
with
everything
that
is
done
under
the
rule
of
the
prophet
and
when
the
mattern
and
the
diaconals
tried
to
force
you
to
an
advancement
for
which
you
were
not
ready
they
were
also
submitting
to
the
rule
of
evil
it
is
asked
only
to
take
steps
we
are
prepared
yes
said
lalette
i
do
not
know
whether
i
can
help
you
let
us
examine
circumstance
are
you
still
stricken
by
lack
of
money
i
had
not
thought
of
it
rodvard
touches
the
fees
of
the
court
where
he
is
writer
our
needs
are
the
widow
s
smile
was
approving
that
is
an
element
of
progress
but
he
receives
these
fees
because
he
uses
the
witchery
of
the
blue
star
does
he
not
then
that
is
an
element
contrary
to
progress
and
very
lalette
looked
at
the
floor
i
know
everything
seems
to
be
a
danger
i
am
so
afraid
of
mathurin
he
keeps
those
guards
around
rodvard
but
i
think
they
are
more
like
one
thing
you
must
not
do
is
let
fear
enter
your
heart
for
it
will
breed
fearful
things
remember
that
all
in
this
false
material
world
is
only
the
reflection
of
your
thoughts
have
you
any
word
from
your
mother
yes
a
man
brought
a
note
she
wants
me
to
escape
and
join
her
at
the
do
you
wish
to
go
i
would
like
to
see
her
again
lalette
looked
up
to
see
dame
domijaiek
watching
her
attentively
though
she
remained
very
quiet
and
under
the
pressure
of
that
silent
scrutiny
the
girl
moved
she
is
under
count
cleudi
s
protection
and
i
told
you
about
demadé
he
is
very
kind
and
gay
and
i
think
he
is
in
love
with
me
go
he
told
mathurin
about
the
little
girl
the
he
was
also
trying
to
do
the
best
for
you
in
his
own
way
do
you
want
to
go
or
would
you
rather
stay
with
rodvard
in
a
small
voice
lalette
said
i
think
i
would
rather
stay
with
him
is
it
wrong
not
if
it
is
done
in
love
and
good
will
rather
than
for
any
hope
of
gain
have
you
asked
him
to
take
you
away
from
the
city
no
is
so
much
to
the
widow
stirred
you
will
find
help
child
come
to
me
again
when
he
makes
a
she
stood
up
but
before
the
words
of
farewell
could
be
pronounced
the
door
was
flung
open
and
the
boy
laduis
burst
in
crying
mother
i
was
at
the
market
laduis
we
have
a
he
looked
embarrassed
and
made
to
lalette
the
bow
of
a
miniature
courtier
oh
i
remember
you
he
said
you
are
the
princess
sunimaa
only
you
are
not
cold
any
more
i
am
glad
to
see
he
turned
again
mother
everybody
at
the
market
is
excited
they
say
there
has
been
a
battle
in
the
ragged
mountains
and
prince
pavinius
has
beaten
the
tritulaccans
and
taken
three
of
their
generals
and
the
rest
of
them
are
all
running
ii
she
had
gone
quietly
to
sleep
rodvard
had
to
rouse
her
with
the
behind
the
right
ear
that
wakens
without
shock
even
then
she
tried
for
a
moment
to
draw
him
close
until
he
whispered
we
must
beyond
the
window
there
was
only
cold
wintry
starshine
and
little
enough
of
that
but
rodvard
had
hoped
for
snow
or
rain
lalette
gathered
her
smallest
of
bundles
he
led
along
the
balcony
three
windows
down
to
where
the
trellis
was
and
stepped
off
backward
into
night
resting
a
moment
on
each
step
before
taking
the
next
lalette
s
dresses
almost
made
her
stumble
on
the
last
steps
she
sank
into
his
arms
with
a
little
gasp
at
the
bottom
they
had
carefully
worked
out
the
matter
of
getting
over
the
from
the
barrel
to
the
the
to
the
wall
itself
it
was
too
late
for
the
on
the
back
street
to
have
remained
alight
as
soon
as
she
was
down
they
dodged
shivering
past
the
across
around
a
corner
and
into
the
appointed
alley
something
jingled
the
man
said
are
you
the
travellers
dame
domijaiek
s
travellers
said
rodvard
as
agreed
and
here
is
your
horse
and
your
the
other
rodvard
got
up
first
the
man
whose
features
remained
indistinguishable
helped
lalette
up
behind
and
gave
them
a
farewell
in
tones
not
unfriendly
rodvard
had
seldom
followed
the
maze
of
streets
toward
the
northwest
quarter
but
it
was
fairly
easy
to
maintain
direction
and
there
was
only
one
gate
leading
to
the
archer
s
highroad
the
horse
walked
and
lalette
felt
so
sleepy
that
it
was
almost
agony
to
keep
her
place
there
was
no
one
moving
on
any
street
and
hardly
a
light
at
any
window
once
a
wrong
turn
led
into
a
blind
alley
but
that
did
not
hold
them
back
long
and
now
they
were
in
the
shadow
of
the
gate
with
a
sentry
barring
the
path
with
a
pike
and
another
holding
up
a
lantern
this
is
a
fine
hour
to
be
leaving
the
city
grumbled
the
first
all
hours
are
fine
when
one
must
go
said
rodvard
and
produced
his
paper
this
was
the
moment
of
test
the
sentry
puzzled
over
it
a
moment
looked
back
at
them
to
the
paper
again
and
said
pass
as
he
turned
back
to
the
with
his
companion
rodvard
caught
a
fragment
of
words
won
t
be
too
glad
to
see
that
couple
and
wondered
what
the
paper
had
said
as
they
reached
the
far
end
of
the
bridge
where
the
ancient
stone
leopard
stands
he
urged
his
mount
to
trot
but
the
pace
was
too
fast
for
lalette
she
had
to
beg
him
not
to
they
moved
for
a
long
time
through
a
space
without
figures
until
like
a
conjurer
s
trick
trees
and
houses
began
to
appear
in
grey
outline
around
them
and
then
slowly
to
take
on
color
the
road
turned
leftward
and
the
river
was
beyond
with
ice
on
it
lalette
said
he
did
not
turn
his
head
what
will
you
have
can
you
forgive
me
for
what
taking
you
away
your
new
day
the
there
is
nothing
to
forgive
i
had
to
they
were
silent
again
and
in
that
silence
the
sun
grew
behind
streaked
clouds
lalette
was
so
tired
and
sore
that
she
felt
she
must
say
something
about
it
but
just
before
endurance
reached
its
limit
they
came
to
the
famous
bridge
of
boats
at
gogau
with
its
inn
on
the
opposite
bank
and
rodvard
said
let
us
rest
here
and
take
he
helped
her
down
and
inside
to
a
seat
still
without
words
and
a
innkeeper
came
to
them
with
a
good
morning
after
he
had
gone
rodvard
said
no
i
do
not
know
quite
what
i
wished
or
what
i
wish
now
but
i
am
sure
it
is
not
to
be
compelled
to
use
all
i
have
in
mathurin
s
way
he
stared
across
the
room
away
from
her
and
she
grateful
that
he
was
not
looking
to
read
her
thought
with
the
blue
star
said
do
you
think
he
can
make
his
regency
stand
i
do
not
know
but
i
think
not
in
the
long
run
if
prince
pavinius
has
beaten
the
tritulaccans
so
badly
he
touched
the
jacket
where
the
cold
stone
lay
this
is
not
me
and
i
ll
not
be
ruled
by
it
no
more
than
you
by
your
gift
of
she
shuddered
slightly
it
is
a
gift
i
never
now
his
face
showed
trouble
he
stood
up
and
paced
the
floor
then
turned
to
the
inn
portal
where
after
a
moment
she
joined
him
looking
out
the
sun
had
daunted
down
the
clouds
picking
everything
out
in
winter
s
white
gold
beneath
them
the
river
hurried
past
carrying
little
pieces
of
ice
against
the
black
boats
at
last
he
said
somewhere
i
have
lost
the
line
i
suppose
that
the
most
we
can
do
is
try
to
use
the
lesser
evil
to
overcome
the
greater
forgiving
what
we
can
it
is
i
who
ask
you
to
forgive
she
put
an
arm
around
his
waist
you
do
not
need
to
i
think
i
love
for
an
enchanted
moment
they
stood
so
then
rodvard
s
hands
went
to
his
neck
and
with
a
swift
motion
he
drew
out
the
blue
star
over
his
head
and
holding
it
in
his
hand
glanced
at
the
stream
and
then
at
lalette
yes
she
said
it
made
only
a
small
splash
where
it
struck
the
water
epilogue
in
view
of
the
speed
with
which
the
clouds
were
driving
past
the
window
there
would
evidently
be
no
business
with
ducks
that
day
hodge
helped
himself
to
more
coffee
i
wonder
what
happened
to
them
afterward
he
said
does
it
matter
said
penfield
when
an
emotional
problem
is
solved
the
others
become
you
don
t
consider
poverty
a
real
problem
asked
mccall
only
in
a
social
and
relative
sense
go
look
at
the
natives
in
the
of
any
state
they
live
on
rice
beans
and
fifteen
cents
a
day
and
remain
quite
hodge
said
i
agree
that
poverty
is
a
minor
matter
in
this
particular
case
but
it
seems
to
me
that
you
re
assuming
too
much
when
you
speak
of
the
emotional
problem
of
that
couple
as
solved
it
s
not
like
a
sum
in
arithmetic
with
a
simple
answer
in
definite
figures
there
are
all
sorts
of
and
involved
to
which
no
definite
values
can
be
assigned
for
instance
isn
t
the
memory
of
the
girl
leece
together
with
one
of
lalette
s
outbursts
of
temper
going
to
produce
an
explosive
mixture
at
some
point
and
aren
t
they
keeping
a
good
deal
from
each
other
penfield
s
long
face
was
thoughtful
there
are
secrets
in
the
background
of
every
union
he
said
even
secrets
as
black
as
the
murder
by
witchcraft
and
as
inexplicable
as
the
failure
and
recovery
of
the
blue
star
but
it
seems
to
me
that
they
are
like
the
disagreements
of
parties
in
a
politically
stable
state
once
the
essential
agreement
to
abide
has
been
reached
any
difficulties
can
be
resolved
or
compromised
another
people
have
a
capacity
for
well
close
attunement
to
each
other
more
of
it
than
we
have
what
puzzles
he
took
a
pull
at
his
cigarette
a
certain
preoccupation
with
mccall
laughed
since
it
was
the
product
of
all
three
of
us
that
probably
came
out
of
hodge
s
mind
somehow
persons
of
your
age
and
mine
hodge
said
i
don
t
know
where
it
came
from
but
i
think
i
can
explain
it
it
goes
with
religion
which
is
so
often
an
outgrowth
of
a
substitute
for
what
really
interests
me
said
mccall
is
what
happened
in
a
political
well
the
developments
seem
fairly
obvious
said
penfield
and
ones
are
always
i
wonder
if
it
really
exists
said
hodge
as
penfield
had
the
night
before
penfield
got
up
went
to
the
window
and
looked
out
at
the
scudding
clouds
i
wonder
if
we
do
