the
old
black
tribes
are
dying
out
and
many
of
their
legends
and
beliefs
are
dying
with
them
these
legends
deal
with
the
world
as
the
blacks
knew
it
with
the
bush
animals
and
birds
the
powers
of
storm
flood
fire
thunder
and
magic
and
the
beings
who
they
thought
controlled
these
powers
with
the
sun
moon
and
stars
and
with
the
life
and
death
of
men
and
women
many
of
the
old
tales
are
savage
enough
but
through
them
runs
a
thread
of
feeling
for
the
nobler
side
of
life
so
far
as
these
wild
people
could
grasp
it
the
spirit
of
is
seen
in
them
and
greed
selfishness
and
cruelty
are
often
punished
as
they
deserve
we
are
apt
to
look
on
the
blacks
as
utter
barbarians
but
as
we
read
their
own
old
stories
we
see
that
they
were
boys
and
girls
men
and
women
not
so
unlike
us
in
many
ways
and
that
they
could
admire
what
we
admire
in
each
other
and
condemn
what
we
would
condemn
the
of
a
people
are
the
story
of
its
soul
and
it
would
be
a
pity
if
the
native
races
of
our
country
were
to
vanish
altogether
before
we
had
collected
enough
of
their
legends
to
let
their
successors
know
what
manner
of
people
lived
in
australia
for
thousands
of
years
before
the
white
man
came
some
valuable
collections
have
indeed
been
made
but
they
are
all
too
few
and
there
must
even
be
many
people
especially
in
the
wilder
parts
of
australia
who
are
in
touch
with
the
aborigines
and
could
if
they
would
get
the
old
men
and
women
to
tell
them
the
stories
which
were
handed
down
to
them
when
they
were
children
in
the
hope
of
persuading
all
young
australians
who
have
the
opportunity
to
collect
and
preserve
what
they
can

the
ancient
life

of

chapter
i
the
camp
lay
calm
and
peaceful
under
the
spring
sunlight
burkamukk
the
chief
had
chosen
its
place
well
the
wurleys
were
built
in
a
green
glade
well
shaded
with
blackwood
and
boobyalla
trees
and
with
a
soft
thick
carpet
of
grass
on
which
the
black
babies
loved
to
roll
not
a
hundred
yards
away
flowed
a
wide
creek
a
creek
so
excellent
that
it
fed
a
swamp
a
little
farther
on
the
blacks
loved
to
be
near
a
swamp
for
it
was
as
good
as
a
storehouse
of
food
the
women
used
to
go
there
for
and
and
the
men
would
spear
eels
in
its
muddy
waters
while
at
times
big
flocks
of
duck
settled
on
it
besides
other
burkamukk
was
a
very
wise
chief
and
all
his
people
were
fat
and
therefore
contented
as
blacks
count
wealth
the
people
of
burkamukk
were
very
well
off
they
had
plenty
of
skin
rugs
so
that
no
one
went
cold
even
in
the
winter
nights
and
the
women
had
made
them
well
sewing
them
together
with
the
sinews
of
animals
using
for
their
needles
the
small
bone
of
a
kangaroo
ground
to
a
fine
point
it
was
hard
work
to
sew
these
well
but
the
men
used
to
take
pains
to
get
good
skins
pegging
them
out
with
spikes
and
dressing
them
with
and
fat
which
they
rubbed
in
until
the
skins
were
soft
and
supple
and
so
the
women
thought
that
the
least
they
could
do
was
to
sew
them
in
the
very
best
way
being
particular
about
the
rugs
made
the
women
particular
about
other
things
as
well
and
they
had
a
far
better
outfit
than
could
be
found
in
most
camps
each
woman
had
a
good
pitchi
a
small
wooden
trough
hollowed
out
of
the
soft
wood
of
the
in
which
food
was
kept
when
the
tribe
went
travelling
the
pitchi
was
as
useful
as
a
is
to
a
white
australian
girl
the
lubras
packed
them
with
food
and
carried
them
balanced
on
their
heads
or
slung
to
one
hip
by
a
plait
of
human
hair
or
a
fur
band
and
sometimes
a
big
pitchi
was
made
by
a
proud
father
and
beautifully
carved
with
a
stone
knife
and
used
as
a
cradle
for
a
fat
black
baby
then
the
women
used
to
weave
baskets
made
of
a
strong
kind
of
rush
ornamented
with
coloured
patterns
and
fancy
stitches
and
each
one
had
as
well
a
bag
made
of
the
tough
inner
bark
of
the
acacia
tree
or
sometimes
of
a
messmate
or
stringy
bark
in
which
she
kept
food
sticks
and
tinder
for
starting
a
fire
for
cement
shells
tools
and
all
sorts
of
charms
to
keep
off
evil
spirits
they
had
a
queer
kind
of
in
which
they
used
to
dissolve
gum
and
manna
these
pots
were
made
out
of
the
big
rough
lumps
that
grow
out
of
old
hollowed
out
by
a
chisel
made
of
a
kangaroo
thighbone
the
women
used
to
put
gum
and
manna
in
these
and
place
them
near
the
fire
so
that
the
water
gradually
heated
without
burning
the
wood
there
was
no
pottery
among
the
blacks
and
so
they
could
never
boil
food
but
they
contrived
to
make
pleasant
warm
drinks
in
these
wooden
pots
when
it
came
to
baking
however
the
women
of
the
tribe
were
well
able
to
turn
out
toothsome
roasts
their
ovens
were
holes
in
the
ground
plastered
with
mud
and
then
filled
with
fire
until
the
clay
was
very
hot
when
the
temperature
was
right
the
embers
were
taken
out
and
the
holes
lined
with
wet
grass
the
food
flesh
fish
or
roots
was
packed
in
rough
rush
baskets
and
placed
in
the
ovens
and
covered
with
more
wet
grass
hot
stones
gravel
and
earth
until
the
holes
were
quite
the
women
liked
to
do
this
in
the
evening
so
that
the
food
cooked
slowly
all
night
and
often
all
the
cooking
was
done
in
a
few
big
ovens
and
next
morning
each
family
came
to
remove
its
basket
of
food
and
if
you
had
come
along
breakfastless
just
as
the
steaming
baskets
were
taken
out
and
had
been
asked
to
join
in
eating
a
plump
young
bandicoot
or
wallaby
or
a
fat
black
fish
well
even
though
there
were
no
plates
or
knives
or
forks
i
do
not
think
you
would
have
grumbled
at
your
meal
the
men
of
burkamukk
tribe
were
well
armed
their
boomerangs
spears
and
were
all
of
the
best
and
they
had
in
addition
knives
made
of
splinters
of
flint
or
sharpened
lashed
into
handles
some
had
skinning
knives
made
of
the
long
front
teeth
of
the
bandicoot
with
the
jaw
left
on
for
a
handle
and
they
worked
kangaroo
bones
into
all
kinds
of
tools
but
burkamukk
himself
had
a
wonderful
weapon
the
only
one
in
all
that
district
a
mighty
axe
it
was
made
of
green
stone
and
sharply
ground
at
one
edge
this
was
grasped
in
the
bend
of
a
doubled
piece
of
split
sapling
and
tightly
bound
round
with
kangaroo
sinews
and
the
handle
thus
formed
was
additionally
strengthened
by
being
cemented
to
the
head
by
a
mixture
of
gum
and
shell
lime
it
was
not
a
very
easy
matter
to
make
that
cement
first
mussel
shells
were
burned
to
make
the
lime
and
pounded
in
a
hollow
stone
then
was
chewed
for
a
long
time
and
placed
between
sheets
of
green
bark
which
were
laid
in
a
shallow
hole
in
the
ground
and
covered
with
hot
ashes
until
the
gum
was
dissolved
when
it
was
kneaded
with
the
lime
into
a
tough
paste
the
blacks
would
have
been
badly
off
without
that
cement
but
not
all
of
them
would
go
to
the
trouble
of
making
it
as
thoroughly
as
did
the
men
of
burkamukk
tribe
all
the
best
workmanship
had
gone
to
the
manufacture
of
burkamukk
axe
and
the
whole
tribe
was
proud
of
it
sometimes
the
chief
would
lend
it
to
the
best
climbers
among
his
young
men
who
used
it
to
cut
steps
in
the
bark
of
trees
when
they
wanted
to
climb
in
search
of
or
or
he
would
let
them
use
it
to
strip
sheets
of
bark
from
the
trees
to
make
their
wurleys
those
to
whom
the
axe
was
lent
always
showed
their
sense
of
the
honour
done
them
by
making
payment
in
kind
the
fattest
of
the
game
caught
or
a
rush
mat
would
be
laid
at
the
chief
door
if
this
had
not
been
done
burkamukk
would
probably
have
looked
wise
next
time
some
one
had
wished
to
borrow
his
axe
and
would
have
remarked
that
he
had
work
for
it
himself
even
though
he
occasionally
lent
the
axe
burkamukk
never
let
it
go
out
of
his
sight
it
was
far
too
precious
a
possession
for
that
he
too
went
hunting
when
the
axe
went
or
watched
it
used
to
prise
great
strips
of
thick
bark
off
the
trees
and
he
probably
worried
the
borrower
very
much
by
continually
directing
how
it
should
be
handled
not
that
the
young
men
would
have
taken
any
risks
with
it
it
was
the
chief
axe
but
its
possession
brought
dignity
upon
the
whole
tribe
other
chiefs
had
axes
more
or
less
excellent
but
there
was
no
weapon
in
all
the
countryside
so
famous
as
the
axe
of
burkamukk
i
doubt
whether
the
kings
of
england
have
valued
their
crown
jewels
so
highly
as
burkamukk
valued
his
stone
treasure
with
the
sapling
handle
certainly
they
can
not
have
found
them
half
so
useful
on
this
spring
afternoon
burkamukk
was
coming
up
from
the
swamp
where
he
had
been
spearing
eels
he
had
been
very
successful
koronn
his
wife
walked
behind
him
carrying
a
dozen
fine
specimens
and
thinking
how
good
a
supper
she
would
be
able
to
cook
and
how
delighted
her
little
boy
tumbo
would
be
for
of
all
things
tumbo
loved
to
eat
eel
just
at
the
edge
of
the
camp
burkamukk
stopped
frowning
a
of
young
men
had
evidently
just
returned
they
were
the
centre
of
a
group
in
the
middle
of
the
camp
and
still
they
were
carrying
their
spears
and
they
were
talking
loudly
and
gesticulating
and
it
was
clear
that
those
who
listened
to
them
were
excited
and
distressed
there
were
anxious
faces
and
the
women
were
crying
yakai
alas
the
chief
strode
up
to
the
group
what
is
the
matter
he
asked
the
men
turned
saluting
him
respectfully
we
have
fallen
upon
evil
times
chief
their
leader
answered
little
game
have
we
caught
and
we
have
lost
lost
him
how
there
is
a
great
and
terrible
beast
in
the
country
to
which
we
went
answered
tullum
the
young
warrior
the
men
of
the
friendly
tribe
we
passed
told
us
of
him
but
we
thought
they
were
joking
with
us
for
it
seemed
a
foolish
tale
only
fit
to
make
women
afraid
they
told
us
of
a
great
kangaroo
they
call
kuperee
larger
than
a
dozen
kangaroos
and
fiercer
than
any
animal
that
walks
on
the
earth
and
they
warned
us
not
to
go
near
his
country
a
kangaroo
as
large
as
a
dozen
said
burkamukk
ky
but
i
would
like
to
see
such
a
beast
the
whole
tribe
could
feed
on
him
ay
they
might
if
one
had
the
luck
to
be
able
to
kill
him
said
tullum
sorrowfully
but
a
kangaroo
of
that
size
is
no
joke
to
encounter
what
said
burkamukk
do
you
mean
me
to
believe
that
there
is
truly
such
a
kangaroo
there
is
indeed
tullum
answered
we
also
did
not
believe
we
went
on
thinking
that
the
other
tribe
merely
wished
to
keep
us
away
from
a
good
we
took
no
precautions
and
we
came
upon
him
suddenly
and
he
was
a
big
kangaroo
do
you
say
tullum
flung
out
his
hands
there
are
no
words
to
tell
you
of
his
bigness
o
chief
he
said
and
his
voice
shook
with
terror
never
has
such
an
animal
been
seen
before
black
is
he
and
huge
and
fierce
and
when
he
saw
us
he
roared
and
rushed
upon
us
there
was
no
time
to
do
battle
he
was
on
us
almost
before
one
could
fling
a
spear
was
nearest
and
he
went
down
with
one
blow
of
the
monster
foot
his
head
crushed
me
he
struck
at
but
luckily
for
me
i
was
almost
out
of
his
reach
still
he
touched
me
see
he
moved
aside
his
and
showed
long
wounds
running
from
his
shoulder
to
his
wrist
wounds
that
looked
as
though
they
had
been
made
by
great
claws
burkamukk
looked
at
them
closely
no
small
beast
did
that
he
said
you
are
lucky
to
be
alive
tullum
ay
said
tullum
briefly
indeed
i
thought
for
a
while
that
i
was
as
dead
as
but
i
managed
to
dodge
behind
a
tree
and
the
bush
was
thick
so
that
by
great
good
fortune
i
got
away
kuperee
gave
chase
but
we
all
scattered
and
luckily
the
one
he
chose
to
follow
was
woma
who
is
the
swiftest
of
us
all
and
woma
gave
him
the
slip
without
much
trouble
for
kuperee
is
so
great
that
he
can
not
get
through
the
trees
quickly
so
we
came
together
again
after
a
day
and
a
night
and
travelled
home
swiftly
and
none
of
you
went
back
to
avenge
the
chief
asked
sternly
tullum
looked
at
him
with
a
curious
mixture
of
shame
and
defiance
nay
he
said
none
of
us
have
ever
been
reckoned
cowards
and
yet
we
did
not
go
back
an
ordinary
enemy
would
not
have
made
us
afraid
but
there
is
something
about
kuperee
that
turns
the
very
heart
to
water
we
hated
ourselves
we
hate
ourselves
still
for
not
going
back
the
blood
of
cries
out
to
us
for
vengeance
on
his
slayer
and
in
our
sleep
we
see
our
comrade
with
his
head
crushed
by
that
terrible
foot
and
yet
we
could
not
turn
we
have
come
home
to
you
like
frightened
children
and
shame
is
on
our
heads
we
know
not
how
to
face
wife
who
sits
there
and
cries
before
her
wurley
another
of
the
warriors
woma
the
spoke
up
with
sullen
anger
in
his
voice
we
are
shamed
he
said
but
there
is
magic
in
it
no
true
animal
is
kuperee
but
an
evil
spirit
no
man
could
possibly
stand
before
him
to
put
anything
they
could
not
understand
down
to
the
score
of
magic
and
evil
spirits
was
the
usual
custom
of
the
blacks
but
this
time
it
seemed
more
than
usually
likely
to
be
true
the
or
nodded
wisely
and
the
women
all
shuddered
and
wailed
afresh
while
the
men
looked
anxious
and
afraid
burkamukk
thought
for
a
moment
before
replying
he
was
a
very
wise
chief
and
while
he
was
just
as
afraid
of
magic
as
any
other
blackfellow
still
he
had
the
safety
of
his
tribe
to
consider
that
is
all
very
well
he
said
at
length
very
likely
it
is
true
but
it
may
not
be
true
after
all
kuperee
may
be
no
more
than
a
very
wonderful
kangaroo
who
has
managed
to
grow
to
an
enormous
size
if
that
is
so
he
will
want
much
food
and
gradually
he
will
hunt
farther
and
farther
all
over
the
country
until
at
last
he
will
come
here
then
we
shall
all
suffer
ay
said
the
men
that
is
true
but
what
can
we
do
i
will
not
sit
down
quietly
until
i
know
for
certain
that
kuperee
is
magic
said
burkamukk
striking
the
ground
with
the
butt
of
his
if
indeed
he
be
magic
then
it
will
be
the
part
of
the
to
deal
with
him
but
first
i
would
have
my
young
men
prove
whether
they
can
not
avenge
it
is
in
my
mind
that
this
kuperee
is
no
more
than
a
huge
animal
and
i
want
his
blood
who
will
shed
it
for
me
there
was
no
lack
of
brave
warriors
among
the
men
of
burkamukk
a
shout
went
up
from
them
and
immediately
forty
or
fifty
sprang
before
him
waking
all
the
bush
echoes
with
their
yells
of
defiance
against
kuperee
or
any
other
giant
animal
whether
kangaroo
or
anything
else
only
tullum
and
the
hunters
who
had
been
with
him
hung
back
and
they
were
unnoticed
in
the
general
excitement
ye
are
too
many
burkamukk
said
surveying
them
proudly
ten
such
men
should
be
a
match
for
any
kangaroo
he
ran
his
eye
over
them
rapidly
and
counted
out
half
a
score
by
name
then
he
bade
the
other
volunteers
fall
back
so
that
the
chosen
warriors
were
left
standing
alone
it
is
well
he
said
namba
shall
be
your
leader
and
you
will
obey
him
in
all
things
find
out
from
tullum
where
to
look
for
this
kuperee
and
see
that
you
go
warily
and
that
your
weapons
are
always
ready
go
seek
kuperee
and
ere
seven
sleeps
have
gone
bring
me
his
tail
to
eat
he
stalked
towards
his
wurley
the
young
men
shouting
yells
of
battle
rushed
for
their
weapons
in
ten
minutes
they
had
gone
running
swiftly
over
the
plain
and
the
camp
was
quiet
again
save
for
the
cries
of
wife
as
she
mourned
for
her
husband
but
alas
within
a
few
days
the
wife
of
was
not
the
only
woman
to
bewail
her
dead
in
less
than
a
week
the
was
back
and
without
three
of
its
bravest
warriors
the
survivors
told
the
same
story
as
tullum
and
his
men
they
had
found
kuperee
this
time
roaming
through
the
bush
in
search
of
food
and
he
had
uttered
a
roar
and
rushed
upon
them
they
had
fought
they
said
but
unavailingly
spears
and
seemed
to
fall
back
blunted
from
the
hide
and
two
of
the
men
had
been
seized
and
devoured
while
the
third
namba
who
rushed
wildly
in
frantically
endeavouring
to
save
them
had
been
crushed
to
earth
with
one
sweeping
blow
then
terror
overwhelming
and
unconquerable
had
fallen
on
the
seven
men
who
remained
and
they
had
fled
never
stopping
until
they
were
far
away
weaponless
and
ashamed
they
crept
back
to
the
camp
with
their
miserable
story
burkamukk
heard
them
in
silence
other
chiefs
might
have
been
angry
and
inflicted
fierce
punishments
but
he
knew
that
to
such
men
there
could
be
no
heavier
penalty
than
to
return
beaten
and
afraid
he
nodded
when
they
had
finished
then
it
would
surely
seem
that
kuperee
is
magic
he
said
therefore
no
man
can
deal
with
him
save
only
the
go
to
your
wurleys
and
rest
the
were
not
at
all
anxious
for
the
task
of
ridding
the
earth
of
kuperee
but
since
their
art
like
that
of
all
consisted
in
saying
as
little
as
possible
they
dared
not
show
their
disinclination
instead
they
accepted
burkamukk
instructions
in
silence
making
themselves
look
as
wise
as
possible
and
nodding
as
though
giant
kangaroos
came
their
way
and
were
swept
out
of
it
every
day
in
the
week
then
they
withdrew
to
a
lonely
place
outside
their
camp
and
began
their
spells
they
lit
tiny
fires
and
burned
scraps
of
throwing
the
ashes
in
the
air
and
uttering
terrible
curses
against
kuperee
also
they
secretly
weaved
many
magic
spells
sitting
by
their
little
fires
and
keeping
a
sharp
lest
any
of
the
tribe
should
see
what
they
were
doing
an
unnecessary
precaution
since
the
tribe
was
far
too
terrified
of
magic
to
go
anywhere
near
them
when
they
had
been
at
work
for
what
they
considered
a
sufficient
length
of
time
they
packed
up
all
their
charms
in
skin
bags
and
returned
to
the
camp
where
they
told
burkamukk
that
kuperee
was
probably
dead
as
a
result
of
their
incantations
but
if
he
is
not
said
their
head
man
then
it
is
because
we
have
nothing
belonging
to
kuperee
himself
to
make
spells
with
if
we
had
so
much
of
a
hair
of
his
tail
or
even
one
of
the
bones
that
he
has
gnawed
then
we
could
make
such
a
spell
that
nothing
in
the
world
could
stand
against
it
as
it
is
we
have
done
wonderful
things
and
he
is
very
likely
dead
certainly
no
other
could
have
done
as
much
burkamukk
thanked
the
very
respectfully
he
did
not
understand
their
magic
at
all
and
he
was
badly
afraid
of
all
magic
still
he
knew
that
the
did
not
always
succeed
in
their
undertakings
and
he
felt
that
though
their
spells
were
no
doubt
strong
there
was
quite
a
chance
that
kuperee
was
stronger
he
would
have
felt
much
happier
had
the
been
able
to
prove
that
the
enemy
was
dead
if
i
could
give
them
a
hair
of
his
tail
thought
he
there
would
be
no
need
for
spells
since
kuperee
will
certainly
be
dead
before
he
allows
anyone
to
meddle
with
his
tail
it
was
with
some
bitterness
that
he
dismissed
the
wise
men
giving
them
a
present
of
roasted
wallaby
it
was
not
long
before
proof
came
that
the
magic
of
the
had
been
at
fault
burkamukk
young
men
out
hunting
met
a
of
a
friendly
tribe
from
whom
they
learned
that
the
great
kangaroo
was
fiercer
and
more
powerful
than
ever
and
had
slain
many
men
in
the
country
to
the
north
as
burkamukk
had
foreseen
he
was
ranging
farther
and
farther
afield
so
that
no
district
could
feel
safe
from
him
it
could
be
only
a
question
of
time
before
kuperee
would
wander
down
to
his
country
burkamukk
held
a
council
of
war
that
night
at
which
all
the
warriors
and
the
were
present
the
chief
wanted
to
lead
his
best
men
against
the
monster
but
the
opposed
the
suggestion
vigorously
saying
that
it
was
not
right
for
the
head
of
the
tribe
to
run
into
a
danger
such
as
this
an
ordinary
battle
was
all
very
well
but
this
was
magic
and
against
it
chiefs
were
just
as
ordinary
men
and
where
would
the
tribe
be
without
its
mighty
head
the
warriors
supported
the
and
they
all
argued
about
it
until
burkamukk
was
ready
to
lose
his
temper
he
had
no
wish
to
see
his
best
hunters
grow
fewer
and
fewer
already
two
expeditions
had
ended
in
disaster
and
loss
the
discussion
was
becoming
an
angry
one
when
suddenly
the
chief
two
eldest
sons
inda
and
pilla
rose
and
spoke
they
were
young
men
but
already
they
were
renowned
hunters
famous
at
tracking
and
killing
game
and
besides
their
skill
with
weapons
it
was
said
that
they
had
learned
from
the
much
wisdom
beyond
the
knowledge
of
ordinary
men
straight
and
tall
as
young
rushes
they
faced
their
father
let
us
go
inda
said
pilla
and
i
numbers
are
useless
against
kuperee
it
is
only
cunning
that
will
slay
him
and
for
that
two
men
are
better
than
a
score
give
us
a
trial
and
if
we
fail
then
will
be
time
enough
to
talk
of
a
great
expedition
the
chief
looked
at
them
with
angry
unhappiness
and
if
you
fail
he
said
then
i
shall
have
lost
my
sons
what
of
that
asked
pilla
you
have
other
sons
and
we
will
have
died
for
the
tribe
that
is
the
right
of
a
chief
son
other
sons
have
tried
and
some
of
them
have
died
now
it
is
our
turn
a
murmur
of
dissent
ran
round
the
circle
for
pilla
and
inda
were
much
loved
and
they
were
very
young
but
burkamukk
looked
at
them
proudly
though
his
face
was
very
sad
they
say
rightly
he
said
they
are
the
chief
sons
and
it
is
their
privilege
if
need
be
to
die
for
the
tribe
go
then
my
sons
and
may
make
your
hearts
cunning
and
your
aim
steady
when
you
meet
kuperee
there
is
one
thing
we
desire
inda
said
will
you
lend
us
your
stone
axe
my
father
it
seems
to
us
that
kuperee
will
fall
to
no
ordinary
weapon
and
a
dream
has
come
to
us
that
bids
us
take
the
axe
but
that
is
for
you
to
say
it
is
a
great
thing
to
ask
but
if
we
live
we
will
bring
it
back
to
you
in
safety
burkamukk
signed
to
a
young
man
who
stood
near
him
and
bade
him
fetch
the
axe
from
his
wurley
when
it
came
he
handed
it
to
his
sons
it
is
a
great
treasure
but
you
are
my
sons
and
you
are
worthy
to
bear
it
he
said
never
before
has
it
left
my
sight
in
the
hands
of
any
warrior
and
i
would
that
i
were
the
one
to
wield
it
against
kuperee
good
luck
go
with
it
and
with
you
my
sons
so
inda
and
pilla
made
themselves
ready
to
go
preparing
as
if
they
were
to
take
part
in
a
splendid
corroboree
they
painted
themselves
with
white
stripes
and
over
and
under
their
eyes
and
on
their
cheeks
drew
streaks
of
red
ochre
round
their
heads
they
wore
twisted
bands
of
fur
and
in
these
bands
they
stuck
plumes
made
of
the
white
quill
feathers
of
a
black
swan
wing
kangaroo
teeth
were
fastened
in
their
hair
and
necklaces
of
the
same
teeth
hung
down
upon
their
breasts
from
their
shoulders
hung
the
tails
of
yellow
dingos
they
wore
belts
and
aprons
of
wallaby
skin
and
fastened
behind
to
these
belts
stiff
upright
tufts
of
the
neck
feathers
of
the
emu
like
the
tail
of
a
cock
they
bore
many
weapons
and
each
took
it
in
turn
to
carry
the
stone
axe
of
burkamukk
the
whole
tribe
came
out
to
watch
them
go
and
while
the
men
were
envious
the
women
wailed
sadly
for
they
were
young
and
it
seemed
that
they
were
going
forth
to
die
chapter
ii
pilla
and
inda
travelled
swiftly
through
the
bush
for
the
first
two
days
of
their
journey
they
passed
through
good
hunting
country
where
they
were
tempted
by
the
sign
of
much
game
but
they
would
not
allow
themselves
to
turn
aside
greatly
as
they
longed
for
fresh
meat
they
carried
a
little
food
with
them
and
were
fortunate
in
finding
much
boombul
which
the
white
people
afterwards
called
manna
a
sweet
white
substance
rather
like
small
pieces
of
with
a
very
delicate
flavour
boombul
drops
from
the
leaves
and
small
branches
of
some
kinds
of
and
the
blacks
loved
to
eat
it
so
pilla
and
inda
thought
themselves
very
lucky
they
met
friendly
blacks
now
and
then
as
they
travelled
and
heard
many
stories
of
the
ferocity
of
kuperee
some
of
the
reports
were
very
terrifying
it
was
difficult
to
find
out
how
huge
he
was
for
he
seemed
to
grow
in
size
according
to
the
terror
of
the
men
who
had
seen
him
some
of
whom
said
he
was
as
large
as
any
but
all
were
agreed
as
to
his
fierceness
he
devoured
men
in
a
single
gulp
he
struck
them
down
as
one
might
strike
a
yurkurn
or
lizard
his
swiftness
in
pursuit
was
terrible
to
see
the
man
he
chased
had
no
chance
whatever
unless
he
managed
to
reach
thick
timber
where
kuperee
size
prevented
his
taking
the
gigantic
leaps
which
so
quickly
ended
a
chase
on
open
ground
and
about
all
the
tales
hung
the
sense
of
blind
fear
which
the
great
beast
seemed
to
inspire
no
matter
how
brave
a
might
be
the
sight
of
kuperee
seemed
to
turn
his
heart
to
water
making
him
long
only
to
flee
like
a
frightened
child
their
voices
shook
with
terror
as
they
spoke
of
him
it
seems
to
me
said
inda
as
they
journeyed
on
after
having
talked
to
some
of
these
hunters
that
our
first
thought
should
be
for
ourselves
all
these
men
have
thought
themselves
very
brave
and
have
gone
out
to
meet
kuperee
never
doubting
that
they
would
not
be
afraid
and
they
have
become
very
afraid
indeed
now
you
and
i
are
no
cowards
in
ordinary
fighting
and
we
have
had
no
fear
of
ourselves
but
i
think
we
had
better
make
up
our
minds
that
we
certainly
shall
become
afraid
and
decide
what
to
do
i
do
not
wish
to
lose
my
senses
and
run
away
like
a
beaten
pickaninny
that
is
good
sense
said
pilla
perhaps
if
we
managed
to
keep
our
heads
during
our
first
terror
it
might
pass
after
a
time
so
that
we
should
again
be
as
men
that
is
my
idea
inda
answered
and
if
kuperee
did
not
happen
to
see
us
while
we
were
afraid
so
much
the
better
for
us
i
do
not
believe
that
fear
will
be
with
us
always
but
still
we
are
no
better
than
all
these
other
men
i
believe
we
will
get
an
attack
of
it
and
then
it
will
pass
off
like
an
attack
of
sickness
if
we
treat
it
properly
yes
said
pilla
nodding
but
if
we
run
away
we
shall
be
afraid
for
ever
always
supposing
we
are
not
dead
if
we
run
away
the
one
that
kuperee
runs
after
will
certainly
be
dead
inda
said
therefore
let
us
go
very
warily
and
perhaps
we
can
manage
so
that
he
does
not
see
us
during
our
first
fear
it
is
a
queer
thing
pilla
said
laughing
for
hunters
to
go
out
making
certain
of
being
afraid
i
think
it
is
a
safe
thing
just
now
said
inda
shortly
this
hunting
is
not
like
other
hunting
so
they
went
on
keeping
a
very
sharp
and
having
their
weapons
always
ready
the
stone
axe
of
burkamukk
was
rather
troublesome
to
them
for
their
hands
were
encumbered
with
spears
and
and
they
were
not
used
to
carrying
an
axe
so
at
last
inda
twisted
strings
of
bark
and
slung
it
across
his
shoulders
where
it
felt
much
more
comfortable
soon
they
came
upon
traces
of
the
great
beast
they
sought
the
forest
began
to
be
full
of
his
tracks
and
the
saplings
had
been
pulled
about
and
gnawed
by
some
creature
larger
than
anything
they
had
ever
seen
and
then
one
evening
they
heard
running
feet
and
leaping
to
one
side
spear
in
hand
they
saw
half
a
dozen
men
racing
through
the
bush
blind
with
terror
one
slipped
and
fell
near
where
they
were
standing
and
rolled
almost
to
their
feet
pilla
and
inda
drew
him
into
a
thicket
is
kuperee
after
you
they
asked
the
man
rolled
his
eyes
upwards
he
has
slain
two
of
us
and
is
now
in
pursuit
of
us
all
he
panted
let
me
go
he
scrambled
to
his
feet
and
dashed
away
pilla
and
inda
crouched
low
in
the
thicket
seeing
nothing
but
presently
they
heard
a
mighty
pounding
through
the
trees
fifty
yards
away
and
though
nothing
was
visible
the
sound
of
those
great
leaps
was
so
terrifying
in
itself
that
they
found
themselves
trembling
the
pounding
died
away
in
the
direction
in
which
the
blacks
had
gone
ky
what
a
tail
he
must
have
that
makes
the
earth
shake
as
he
goes
inda
muttered
never
have
i
heard
anything
like
it
art
afraid
pilla
very
much
i
believe
said
pilla
but
it
will
pass
i
feel
sure
brother
it
seems
to
me
that
kuperee
den
must
be
not
far
off
and
it
would
be
safe
to
try
to
find
it
since
he
has
gone
southward
for
his
hunting
and
most
likely
he
will
return
slowly
let
us
push
on
while
we
can
go
quickly
that
is
good
talk
inda
answered
perhaps
we
can
hide
ourselves
near
his
den
and
watch
him
without
being
seen
i
should
like
to
get
my
terror
over
in
a
high
tree
i
too
said
pilla
i
fancy
the
attack
might
pass
more
quickly
let
us
hurry
they
pushed
onward
as
fast
as
possible
it
was
not
hard
to
find
the
way
for
the
blacks
had
fled
too
madly
to
trouble
about
leaving
tracks
and
the
marks
of
their
running
made
a
clear
path
to
native
eyes
soon
too
they
came
upon
kuperee
tracks
great
footprints
and
deep
depressions
in
the
earth
where
his
enormous
tail
had
hit
the
ground
at
every
bound
then
the
bush
became
more
and
more
beaten
down
as
though
some
great
animal
roamed
through
it
constantly
and
at
last
they
found
the
body
of
a
hunter
struck
down
from
behind
as
he
ran
it
was
no
playful
tap
that
killed
him
said
pilla
with
a
shudder
the
other
i
suppose
was
eaten
as
kuperee
loves
to
eat
men
in
one
gulp
see
inda
is
not
that
where
he
sleeps
they
were
near
a
cleared
space
where
the
ground
was
much
trampled
bones
lay
here
and
there
and
in
the
shadow
of
a
dense
lightwood
tree
in
the
middle
the
grass
showed
clearly
where
a
great
body
had
often
lain
no
kangaroo
has
any
kind
of
hole
for
they
love
the
bush
to
sleep
in
and
kuperee
was
evidently
like
other
kangaroos
in
this
probably
he
changed
his
home
often
but
this
was
a
good
place
ringed
about
with
bushes
that
made
it
quiet
and
hard
to
find
so
that
no
enemy
was
likely
to
come
upon
him
too
suddenly
while
from
his
lair
under
the
lightwood
he
could
see
anything
approach
men
or
animals
or
leaves
it
does
not
seem
to
matter
to
him
what
he
eats
said
inda
looking
at
the
lair
no
wonder
he
grows
huge
pilla
i
am
very
afraid
but
i
feel
i
will
not
always
be
afraid
let
us
climb
up
into
the
lightwood
tree
he
will
never
see
us
among
its
thick
leaves
then
he
will
come
home
tired
and
perhaps
we
can
spear
him
as
he
sleeps
they
climbed
up
into
the
dense
branches
mounting
high
and
choosing
stout
limbs
to
lie
on
where
they
could
peer
down
below
and
they
fixed
their
spears
and
other
weapons
so
that
they
could
use
them
easily
the
stone
axe
of
burkamukk
was
much
in
inda
way
in
climbing
and
finally
he
untied
it
from
his
shoulders
i
do
not
see
how
i
can
use
this
in
the
tree
he
said
see
i
will
strike
it
into
the
trunk
so
that
we
can
get
at
it
handily
if
we
need
it
he
smote
it
against
the
trunk
and
the
wood
held
it
fast
then
he
and
pilla
took
their
places
and
watched
for
the
coming
of
kuperee
they
had
not
long
to
wait
presently
came
far
off
the
sound
of
great
bounds
and
breaking
saplings
not
as
they
had
heard
it
last
in
the
fierceness
of
pursuit
but
slowly
as
a
man
may
return
home
after
successful
hunting
the
brothers
felt
their
hearts
thumping
as
they
waited
nearer
and
nearer
came
the
sound
and
soon
the
bushes
parted
and
a
mighty
kangaroo
hopped
into
the
clearing
so
huge
was
he
so
black
and
fierce
that
they
caught
at
each
other
in
terror
never
had
they
dreamed
of
any
kangaroo
like
this
his
fur
was
thick
and
long
and
of
a
glossy
black
his
head
carried
proudly
aloft
his
great
tail
like
the
limb
of
a
tree
and
in
his
gleaming
eyes
and
on
his
fierce
face
was
an
expression
of
cunning
and
ferocity
that
even
more
than
his
size
made
him
unlike
any
animal
the
bush
had
ever
known
something
of
mystery
and
terror
seemed
to
surround
him
it
was
indeed
clear
that
he
was
magic
pilla
and
inda
trembled
so
that
they
feared
that
the
lightwood
would
shake
and
reveal
them
to
the
monster
he
sat
down
out
on
the
clear
space
and
rubbed
his
mouth
with
his
forepaws
sniffing
at
the
air
so
that
they
fell
into
a
further
terror
thinking
he
had
smelt
them
out
but
one
blackfellow
smells
much
like
another
and
kuperee
had
recently
dealt
with
three
blacks
if
he
noticed
any
unusual
odour
he
put
it
down
to
his
late
meal
he
felt
sleepy
and
he
had
enjoyed
both
his
run
and
his
meal
now
he
only
wanted
sleep
he
hopped
towards
the
lightwood
and
at
his
coming
pilla
and
inda
felt
themselves
gripped
by
overmastering
fear
their
teeth
chattered
their
dry
tongues
seemed
to
choke
them
they
clung
to
their
boughs
dreading
lest
their
trembling
hold
should
loosen
bringing
them
tumbling
at
his
feet
so
gripping
with
toes
and
fingers
with
sweating
cheeks
pressed
closely
to
the
limbs
with
staring
eyes
that
peered
downwards
they
watched
the
dreadful
beast
come
he
came
in
under
the
tree
and
lay
down
stretching
himself
out
to
sleep
and
in
a
few
moments
his
heavy
breathing
showed
that
he
had
passed
quietly
into
slumber
as
they
watched
something
of
their
terror
left
the
brothers
asleep
kuperee
was
not
so
horrible
he
looked
indeed
not
so
unlike
any
other
kangaroo
with
his
fierce
eyes
veiled
and
the
strength
of
his
great
body
relaxed
i
believe
my
time
of
fear
is
passing
inda
whispered
he
is
but
a
kangaroo
after
all
yes
but
what
a
terrible
one
murmured
pilla
as
well
as
his
chattering
teeth
would
let
him
still
we
are
mighty
hunters
and
no
fools
unless
he
is
really
magic
we
should
be
able
to
subdue
him
i
am
beginning
to
feel
a
man
again
we
do
not
know
for
certain
that
he
is
magic
let
us
believe
then
that
he
is
not
and
that
will
help
us
inda
whispered
why
should
we
not
spear
him
as
he
lies
we
might
easily
do
it
let
us
creep
to
the
lower
boughs
where
we
shall
have
more
room
to
move
our
arms
art
afraid
any
longer
inda
not
as
i
was
inda
replied
at
least
not
while
he
sleeps
then
let
us
try
to
arrange
that
he
shall
never
wake
pilla
murmured
very
softly
with
infinite
caution
they
crept
down
the
tree
until
they
came
to
the
great
lower
limbs
here
they
had
space
to
swing
their
arms
and
they
made
their
weapons
ready
below
the
huge
kangaroo
never
stirred
his
deep
breathing
telling
of
sound
slumber
was
music
in
the
ears
of
the
brothers
they
nodded
a
signal
to
each
other
as
they
poised
their
first
spears
so
swiftly
did
they
throw
that
before
kuperee
was
aroused
from
his
sleep
a
shower
of
and
spears
had
hurtled
through
the
air
not
one
missed
the
mark
was
easy
and
the
brothers
were
proved
hunters
the
weapons
sped
fast
and
true
but
a
terrible
thing
happened
each
point
as
it
struck
kuperee
fur
became
blunt
and
instead
of
piercing
him
in
fifty
places
the
weapons
fell
back
from
him
spent
and
useless
with
a
groan
of
fear
the
brothers
grasped
at
the
branches
and
swung
themselves
aloft
below
kuperee
roar
of
fury
drowned
all
other
sounds
he
sprang
to
his
feet
his
eyes
blazing
he
had
received
no
injury
but
he
had
been
touched
that
in
itself
was
an
indignity
he
had
never
suffered
before
with
another
roar
he
looked
about
for
his
foes
to
be
attacked
from
the
air
was
a
new
experience
for
kuperee
all
his
other
enemies
had
come
upon
him
out
of
the
bush
and
it
never
occurred
to
him
in
his
rage
to
look
upward
where
the
shaking
of
the
branches
would
certainly
have
revealed
the
terrified
pilla
and
inda
instead
seeing
nothing
kuperee
made
sure
that
the
trees
concealed
the
attackers
he
roared
again
dreadfully
and
bounded
across
the
clearing
the
bush
closed
behind
him
but
the
sky
rang
with
the
echo
of
his
terrible
voice
and
the
thud
of
the
leaps
that
carried
him
rapidly
away
kuperee
sleeping
and
kuperee
awake
and
angry
were
two
very
different
beings
and
with
the
first
movement
of
the
monster
all
their
fear
had
come
back
to
pilla
and
inda
as
roar
succeeded
roar
they
became
more
and
more
weak
with
terror
their
grip
on
the
boughs
relaxed
with
the
trembling
of
their
hands
and
even
as
kuperee
bounded
away
they
lost
their
hold
and
tumbled
bodily
out
of
the
tree
it
was
not
far
to
the
ground
but
pilla
happened
to
fall
first
and
inda
fell
on
top
of
him
and
they
managed
to
hurt
each
other
a
good
deal
they
were
in
that
excited
and
state
when
anything
seems
an
injury
and
each
lost
his
temper
you
did
that
on
purpose
pilla
said
striking
at
his
brother
take
that
would
you
said
inda
between
his
teeth
i
teach
you
to
hit
me
he
stooped
and
picked
up
one
of
the
and
flung
it
at
his
brother
it
hit
pilla
violently
on
the
nose
and
made
him
furiously
angry
he
gathered
an
armful
of
the
fallen
spears
and
running
back
threw
them
at
inda
so
swiftly
that
there
was
no
time
to
dodge
they
hit
him
all
over
his
body
and
though
they
had
all
become
blunt
they
hurt
very
badly
the
blood
was
streaming
from
pilla
nose
and
when
he
had
thrown
all
his
spears
he
stopped
to
wipe
it
off
with
a
tuft
of
grass
the
pause
gave
them
time
to
think
and
they
stared
at
each
other
suddenly
they
burst
out
laughing
what
fools
we
are
they
said
yes
we
are
indeed
fools
said
inda
rubbing
his
bruises
kuperee
may
be
back
at
any
moment
and
here
we
will
be
found
fighting
each
other
like
a
couple
of
stupid
boys
i
am
sorry
i
hurt
you
brother
you
have
certainly
done
that
said
pilla
caressing
his
nose
gently
there
will
be
a
dint
down
my
nose
for
ever
the
bone
is
broken
i
think
why
do
you
hit
kuperee
as
hard
as
that
i
will
if
i
get
the
chance
inda
said
and
you
yourself
are
no
child
when
it
comes
to
throwing
spears
a
good
thing
for
me
that
they
were
blunt
yes
brother
we
are
the
biggest
fools
in
the
bush
now
what
are
we
to
do
save
yourself
screamed
pilla
here
comes
kuperee
the
great
kangaroo
came
bounding
back
through
the
bushes
and
the
brothers
wild
with
terror
flung
themselves
at
the
lightwood
tree
up
they
went
but
only
just
in
time
inda
heel
was
grazed
by
claw
as
he
gained
the
safety
of
the
lower
branches
he
climbed
up
swiftly
and
clinging
together
they
looked
down
at
their
foe
he
can
not
climb
gasped
pilla
no
but
he
will
have
the
tree
down
cried
his
brother
kuperee
was
flinging
himself
against
the
tree
until
it
rocked
beneath
the
blows
of
his
great
body
again
and
again
came
the
dull
thud
as
he
drew
himself
back
and
came
dashing
against
the
trunk
gradually
it
yielded
beginning
to
lean
sidewards
lower
and
lower
it
came
and
kuperee
rising
high
on
his
and
tail
clawed
upward
at
inda
as
the
hunter
with
a
cry
of
despair
tried
to
pull
himself
higher
pilla
leaning
from
an
upper
branch
thrust
something
into
his
hand
it
is
the
stone
axe
of
our
father
he
gasped
strike
with
it
brother
inda
grasped
the
handle
and
smote
downward
with
all
his
might
the
keen
edge
of
the
stone
caught
kuperee
in
the
forehead
and
sank
into
his
head
he
fell
back
wrenching
the
axe
from
inda
hand
one
more
terrific
roar
rent
the
air
a
cry
of
pain
and
anger
fearful
to
hear
then
with
a
dull
groan
the
monster
sank
sidewards
to
the
grass
he
was
dead
it
was
long
before
pilla
and
inda
dared
to
quit
the
shelter
of
the
leaning
tree
they
could
scarcely
believe
that
their
enemy
was
dead
until
they
saw
the
mighty
limbs
stiffen
and
beheld
a
crow
perch
unmolested
on
kuperee
head
then
the
brothers
came
down
from
the
tree
and
clasped
each
other
hands
that
was
a
good
blow
of
yours
said
pilla
ay
but
it
would
never
have
been
struck
had
you
not
put
the
axe
into
my
hands
said
inda
i
had
forgotten
all
about
it
our
names
will
live
long
brother
that
will
be
agreeable
but
i
wish
my
nose
were
not
so
sore
said
pilla
and
your
bruises
how
are
they
sore
enough
but
i
had
almost
forgotten
them
ky
but
i
am
hungry
pilla
i
too
said
pilla
looking
with
interest
at
the
great
dead
body
well
at
least
we
have
plenty
of
food
burkamukk
said
long
ago
that
kuperee
should
be
enough
for
the
whole
tribe
let
us
skin
him
carefully
for
his
hide
will
be
a
proud
trophy
to
take
back
to
our
father
if
we
can
but
carry
it
we
shall
eat
him
while
it
is
drying
inda
said
then
the
skin
will
be
lighter
and
we
shall
be
exceedingly
strong
come
brother
my
hunger
grows
worse
they
fell
to
work
on
the
huge
carcass
with
their
sharp
made
of
the
of
kangaroos
and
then
befel
the
most
wonderful
thing
of
all
chapter
iii
inda
and
pilla
took
off
the
black
hide
of
kuperee
and
pegged
it
out
carefully
with
sharp
sticks
then
they
came
back
to
the
body
and
their
eyes
glistened
with
satisfaction
meat
is
the
best
thing
in
the
world
to
a
blackfellow
and
never
before
had
either
seen
so
much
meat
it
was
almost
staggering
to
think
that
it
was
theirs
and
to
be
eaten
all
they
had
feared
and
suffered
became
as
nothing
in
the
prospect
of
that
tremendous
feast
yakai
mourned
pilla
we
shall
never
finish
it
all
before
it
goes
bad
not
though
we
eat
day
and
night
without
ceasing
as
i
mean
to
do
and
i
also
agreed
inda
let
us
make
ovens
before
we
begin
to
cut
him
up
we
shall
waste
less
time
that
way
some
of
him
will
certainly
go
bad
but
we
will
do
our
best
they
were
turning
aside
to
gather
sticks
when
pilla
suddenly
caught
at
his
brother
arm
he
happened
to
seize
a
bruised
part
and
inda
was
justly
annoyed
take
care
blockhead
he
said
shaking
him
off
roughly
i
ache
all
over
is
it
not
enough
for
you
pilla
took
no
notice
he
was
staring
at
the
skinned
body
of
kuperee
with
eyes
that
were
almost
starting
from
his
head
look
he
gasped
look
he
moves
inda
leaped
to
one
side
moves
he
uttered
are
you
mad
i
saw
his
side
move
pilla
repeated
see
there
it
is
again
something
bulged
under
the
stripped
skin
of
the
monster
the
brothers
leaped
backward
but
he
is
certainly
dead
gasped
inda
have
we
not
skinned
him
can
a
skinned
animal
move
even
if
he
be
kuperee
let
us
leave
him
and
go
home
muttered
pilla
he
is
very
bad
magic
but
that
was
more
than
inda
could
bring
himself
to
do
leave
him
he
exclaimed
leave
the
most
wonderful
feast
ever
heard
of
in
all
the
bush
no
i
will
not
magic
or
no
magic
he
is
dead
and
i
will
see
what
moves
he
sprang
forward
knife
in
hand
and
with
a
quick
movement
slit
open
the
body
out
popped
a
head
a
black
head
with
fear
and
pain
and
bewilderment
on
its
features
inda
sprang
back
raising
his
knife
to
defend
himself
let
me
out
begged
the
head
it
is
horrible
in
here
no
air
no
light
nothing
but
dead
men
let
me
out
i
say
are
you
magic
gasped
inda
magic
i
the
wild
eyes
rolled
in
astonishment
i
am
kanalka
of
the
crow
tribe
but
an
hour
ago
kuperee
swallowed
me
at
a
gulp
when
he
came
upon
me
in
the
forest
i
do
not
know
why
i
am
not
dead
but
i
live
yet
though
i
was
wishing
to
die
when
suddenly
you
let
the
light
in
to
my
prison
make
your
hole
larger
friend
and
let
me
out
do
you
say
there
are
dead
men
there
demanded
pilla
he
is
full
of
them
i
only
am
alive
i
suppose
because
i
was
the
last
eaten
be
quick
be
quick
half
doubting
half
afraid
inda
opened
the
great
body
and
helped
kanalka
out
he
staggered
and
fell
helplessly
to
the
ground
pilla
and
inda
did
not
trouble
about
him
one
after
another
they
took
from
kuperee
ten
black
hunters
laying
them
in
a
row
upon
the
grass
last
of
all
they
took
out
and
three
others
of
their
own
tribe
and
they
wailed
over
them
kanalka
who
had
somewhat
recovered
came
and
looked
curiously
at
the
row
of
men
would
you
not
say
that
they
were
alive
he
asked
they
do
not
look
as
though
they
were
anything
but
asleep
i
think
it
is
magic
said
inda
very
much
afraid
two
moons
have
gone
by
since
who
lies
there
was
eaten
and
yet
he
looks
as
though
asleep
kuperee
was
a
strange
host
truly
to
keep
you
all
in
such
good
condition
the
gaze
of
kanalka
wandered
to
the
stone
axe
of
burkamukk
which
lay
on
the
grass
near
kuperee
instantly
he
became
interested
he
had
seen
many
dead
men
but
no
such
axe
as
this
had
come
his
way
is
that
the
mighty
axe
of
which
all
the
tribes
have
heard
he
asked
eagerly
ky
what
a
beauty
never
have
i
seen
such
a
one
i
should
like
to
handle
it
he
picked
it
up
and
tested
its
weight
while
pilla
and
inda
watched
him
carefully
for
they
knew
that
the
axe
was
a
treasure
beyond
anything
in
the
bush
and
that
a
man
would
risk
almost
anything
to
possess
it
they
need
not
however
have
feared
kanalka
he
was
a
fellow
and
was
merely
lost
in
admiration
a
beauty
indeed
he
exclaimed
it
will
be
something
to
tell
my
people
that
in
the
one
day
i
escaped
from
the
body
of
kuperee
and
handled
the
stone
axe
of
burkamukk
was
it
with
this
that
you
killed
the
monster
ay
said
inda
it
clove
his
skull
one
blow
was
enough
though
our
spears
had
fallen
blunted
from
his
hide
a
marvel
indeed
cried
kanalka
it
would
be
a
mighty
weapon
at
close
quarters
in
a
fight
one
would
swing
it
round
thus
and
bring
it
down
upon
the
enemy
head
he
illustrated
his
meaning
swinging
the
axe
aloft
and
bringing
it
down
over
the
head
of
the
silent
form
of
just
before
it
reached
the
head
he
checked
it
letting
it
do
no
more
than
touch
a
touch
no
heavier
than
the
sweep
of
a
butterfly
wing
yawned
sneezed
and
sat
up
with
a
yell
of
terror
the
three
blacks
started
backwards
tripped
over
each
other
and
fell
in
a
heap
surveyed
the
struggling
mass
calmly
where
am
i
he
asked
and
what
is
all
this
about
is
it
you
pilla
and
inda
they
struggled
to
their
feet
and
looked
at
him
distrustfully
you
are
dead
said
pilla
firmly
why
do
you
talk
i
do
not
know
why
indeed
since
it
is
evident
that
i
am
talking
to
fools
said
rudely
what
has
happened
to
you
that
you
and
this
stranger
have
suddenly
gone
mad
ky
how
hungry
i
am
have
you
food
the
brothers
suddenly
began
to
laugh
helplessly
food
said
inda
there
is
more
food
than
ever
you
saw
before
and
a
few
minutes
ago
you
were
part
of
it
that
is
a
riddle
i
am
too
tired
to
guess
said
crossly
i
only
wish
that
any
food
were
part
of
me
for
i
feel
as
though
i
had
never
eaten
in
my
life
it
is
certainly
two
moons
at
least
since
last
you
ate
pilla
told
him
i
said
already
that
you
were
mad
and
i
grow
more
sure
of
it
every
minute
said
poor
who
are
these
who
lie
beside
me
they
are
dead
men
and
a
moment
ago
you
too
were
dead
inda
said
became
afraid
as
well
as
cross
it
was
clear
that
everybody
was
mad
and
he
had
heard
that
it
was
wise
to
humour
mad
people
or
they
might
do
you
an
injury
so
he
hid
his
feelings
and
looked
at
the
brothers
as
kindly
as
his
bewilderment
and
hunger
would
let
him
dead
was
i
he
said
then
how
did
i
come
to
life
this
man
touched
you
with
the
stone
axe
of
burkamukk
inda
answered
dear
me
how
simple
said
none
of
our
know
anything
half
so
easy
but
why
does
he
not
go
on
and
bring
all
these
other
dead
men
to
life
too
indeed
said
kanalka
suddenly
i
do
not
know
he
flung
himself
upon
the
stone
axe
which
he
had
let
fall
in
his
terror
and
touched
another
still
form
with
it
instantly
the
black
hunter
came
to
life
kanalka
uttered
a
wild
yell
of
amazement
and
triumph
then
inda
snatched
the
axe
from
him
and
ran
along
the
line
touching
one
man
after
another
and
when
he
had
come
to
the
end
there
were
ten
blackfellows
sitting
up
and
rubbing
their
eyes
and
most
of
them
were
asking
eagerly
for
food
the
brothers
drew
back
a
few
paces
and
looked
at
them
it
is
clear
said
pilla
that
kuperee
was
magic
and
that
when
our
father
stone
axe
entered
his
skull
it
became
magic
too
more
than
ever
we
must
guard
it
carefully
since
it
seems
to
have
the
power
of
life
and
death
he
lowered
his
voice
speaking
to
inda
i
will
lash
it
to
your
shoulders
brother
we
are
among
strangers
and
it
will
be
safer
so
he
lashed
the
axe
to
inda
shoulders
firmly
and
the
other
men
looked
on
each
knew
exactly
why
he
was
doing
it
and
respected
him
for
his
caution
since
each
knew
that
had
chance
thrown
in
his
way
the
mighty
stone
axe
he
would
not
have
been
proof
against
the
temptation
of
trying
to
get
possession
of
it
then
they
all
talked
together
and
were
very
amazed
at
what
had
happened
to
them
but
since
they
were
able
to
put
everything
down
to
magic
nothing
worried
them
much
and
they
were
quite
relieved
to
find
themselves
alive
and
to
think
of
seeing
their
wives
and
children
again
more
than
anything
they
were
overjoyed
at
the
magnificent
feast
that
awaited
them
and
what
a
feast
it
was
never
again
in
all
their
lives
did
such
a
chance
come
to
them
the
wild
black
never
asked
for
any
trimmings
with
his
food
he
would
indeed
eat
anything
that
came
his
way
but
meat
meat
only
and
still
more
meat
was
what
his
soul
most
desired
and
now
meat
awaited
them
in
a
huge
mountain
and
they
were
hungry
beyond
belief
we
will
cut
up
kuperee
said
pilla
and
inda
since
we
alone
have
knives
the
rest
of
you
must
make
fire
and
prepare
ovens
the
men
scattered
to
their
tasks
some
gathered
sticks
others
scooped
out
holes
in
the
ground
for
the
ovens
others
teased
dry
messmate
bark
for
tinder
for
the
man
who
was
making
the
fire
this
was
and
he
did
it
very
quickly
pilla
lent
him
one
of
his
most
useful
household
necessaries
which
he
always
carried
with
him
a
piece
of
dry
cane
having
a
hole
bored
through
to
the
pith
on
its
upper
side
and
a
pointed
piece
of
soft
wood
and
these
were
just
as
useful
to
the
blacks
as
a
box
of
matches
would
be
to
you
sat
down
on
the
ground
holding
the
bit
of
firmly
down
with
his
feet
and
pressed
the
point
of
the
soft
wood
into
the
little
hole
then
he
held
it
upright
between
his
palms
and
twirled
it
rapidly
within
two
minutes
smoke
began
to
curl
round
the
twirling
point
and
another
man
carefully
put
some
teased
bark
soft
and
dry
round
the
hole
and
blew
on
it
a
moment
more
and
a
thin
tongue
of
flame
licked
through
the
tinder
more
and
more
was
fed
to
it
and
then
leaves
and
twigs
and
in
five
minutes
there
was
a
blazing
fire
while
restored
to
pilla
his
two
sticks
very
little
the
worse
for
wear
the
blacks
did
not
usually
light
a
large
fire
after
the
fashion
of
white
men
who
like
to
make
a
campfire
so
big
that
they
roast
their
faces
while
their
backs
remain
cold
the
way
the
blacks
preferred
was
to
make
two
little
fires
and
to
sit
between
them
so
that
they
were
kept
warm
on
both
sides
but
on
this
occasion
they
made
a
very
big
blaze
so
that
they
should
quickly
have
enough
fire
to
heat
the
ovens
and
then
they
made
the
big
fire
long
and
narrow
so
that
they
could
sit
on
each
side
of
it
and
cook
while
the
ovens
were
getting
hot
they
took
small
pieces
of
the
kangaroo
meat
and
speared
them
on
green
sticks
holding
them
before
the
coals
they
were
all
so
desperately
hungry
that
they
did
not
care
much
whether
the
meat
was
properly
cooked
as
soon
as
the
first
pieces
were
warmed
through
they
stuffed
them
into
their
mouths
and
then
ran
to
pilla
and
inda
for
more
pilla
and
inda
were
working
hard
at
cutting
up
kuperee
and
though
they
did
not
mind
the
hungry
men
beginning
without
them
they
became
annoyed
when
they
came
again
and
again
for
fragments
do
not
forget
that
we
are
hungry
too
pilla
growled
we
have
travelled
far
before
we
killed
kuperee
and
let
you
all
out
and
now
we
are
cutting
up
your
meat
for
you
if
you
do
not
bring
us
some
cooked
pieces
we
must
go
and
cook
for
ourselves
that
made
the
others
afraid
for
the
of
so
huge
an
animal
as
kuperee
was
no
light
work
and
none
of
them
had
knives
so
they
fed
the
brothers
with
toothsome
morsels
as
they
worked
and
the
cutting
went
on
unchecked
until
the
ovens
were
hot
and
there
was
a
pile
of
joints
ready
to
be
put
in
this
was
done
wrapping
the
joints
in
green
leaves
then
they
carried
to
the
fire
the
great
heap
of
small
pieces
of
meat
left
from
the
and
cooked
and
ate
and
ate
and
cooked
all
through
the
night
even
in
ordinary
life
it
would
have
astonished
you
to
see
how
much
meat
a
black
could
eat
a
blackfellow
with
a
wife
who
kept
his
wurley
well
supplied
with
roots
and
grubs
and
all
the
other
pleasant
things
they
loved
but
these
blacks
had
had
no
food
some
of
them
for
weeks
and
it
seemed
that
they
would
never
stop
the
great
pile
of
pieces
dwindled
until
there
were
none
left
and
then
they
hacked
more
off
and
cooked
and
ate
until
the
ovens
were
ready
and
the
smoking
joints
came
out
they
were
so
hot
that
you
would
not
have
cared
to
touch
them
without
a
knife
and
fork
but
the
blacks
seized
them
and
tore
them
to
pieces
and
gnawed
them
until
nothing
remained
but
bones
and
then
they
cooked
more
pilla
and
inda
were
the
first
to
give
in
and
they
had
eaten
enough
for
twenty
white
men
they
waddled
off
to
a
thicket
and
flung
themselves
under
a
bush
sleeping
back
to
back
so
that
the
stone
axe
of
burkamukk
was
safe
between
them
but
the
others
had
no
thought
for
anything
but
kangaroo
and
even
the
mighty
axe
could
not
have
tempted
them
from
that
tremendous
gorge
they
ate
on
all
through
the
day
towards
night
some
of
them
gave
in
then
one
by
one
they
could
eat
no
more
and
most
of
them
went
to
sleep
where
they
sat
before
the
fire
but
dawn
on
the
next
day
showed
the
steadfast
rotund
beyond
belief
and
eating
still
and
by
that
time
pilla
and
inda
had
slept
off
their
light
repast
and
were
ready
to
begin
all
over
again
they
camped
for
more
than
a
week
by
the
carcass
of
kuperee
and
ate
it
until
it
was
no
longer
pleasant
to
eat
even
for
a
blackfellow
then
they
began
to
think
it
was
time
to
return
to
their
tribes
so
they
greased
their
bodies
comfortably
all
over
and
set
off
through
the
forest
a
peaceful
and
happy
band
far
too
to
think
of
quarrelling
when
they
came
near
the
of
each
tribe
they
marched
to
its
camp
in
a
proud
procession
returning
the
warriors
who
had
been
mourned
as
dead
and
great
were
the
rejoicings
throughout
the
country
and
rich
rewards
of
furs
and
weapons
and
food
were
showered
upon
inda
and
pilla
the
stone
axe
of
burkamukk
became
more
famous
than
ever
and
every
one
wanted
to
look
at
the
wonderful
weapon
that
had
slain
kuperee
songs
were
made
about
the
two
heroes
and
for
ages
afterwards
mothers
used
to
tell
their
children
about
them
and
hope
that
their
boys
would
be
as
brave
as
burkamukk
sons
at
last
they
drew
near
to
their
own
camp
they
halted
the
night
before
a
few
hours
journey
away
and
by
good
luck
they
met
a
couple
of
boys
out
hunting
and
sent
them
in
to
tell
the
tribe
that
they
were
coming
they
had
no
idea
of
coming
in
unheralded
for
they
knew
they
had
done
a
great
deed
and
they
meant
to
return
in
state
besides
although
the
rescued
men
were
with
them
the
load
of
presents
they
had
received
was
far
too
heavy
to
be
carried
comfortably
they
got
up
early
and
painted
themselves
in
stripes
and
put
on
their
finest
feathers
and
furs
inda
carried
the
stone
axe
of
burkamukk
and
pilla
had
only
a
spear
long
before
they
were
ready
to
start
they
were
met
by
some
of
the
men
of
the
tribe
who
had
come
out
to
welcome
them
these
loaded
themselves
with
the
gifts
and
with
pilla
and
inda
stalking
in
front
and
the
rescued
men
behind
they
formed
themselves
into
a
procession
and
marched
for
home
near
the
camp
another
procession
came
out
to
meet
them
burkamukk
their
father
marching
at
the
head
of
all
his
tribe
first
came
the
very
solemn
and
inwardly
very
disgusted
that
the
honour
of
slaying
kuperee
had
not
fallen
to
them
then
came
all
the
warriors
and
the
old
men
then
the
boys
and
lastly
the
women
and
children
they
were
shouting
greetings
and
praises
and
singing
songs
of
welcome
burkamukk
halted
as
his
sons
drew
near
they
came
up
to
him
and
knelt
before
him
and
inda
laid
the
stone
axe
at
his
feet
we
bring
you
back
your
mighty
weapon
my
father
he
said
it
has
slain
your
enemy
then
all
the
tribe
shouted
afresh
and
the
warriors
leaped
in
the
air
and
the
whole
country
was
filled
with
the
sound
of
their
rejoicings
and
they
bore
pilla
and
inda
home
in
triumph
naming
them
the
most
famous
heroes
of
all
the
tribes
of
the
bush
but
the
magic
of
kuperee
was
not
done
with
them
yet
they
feasted
late
that
night
and
the
sun
was
high
overhead
before
they
woke
next
day
they
were
in
a
wurley
by
themselves
but
outside
the
boys
of
the
tribe
were
clustered
peeping
in
to
see
the
mighty
warriors
pilla
stretched
himself
and
flung
out
an
arm
which
struck
inda
take
care
inda
said
angrily
waking
up
you
hurt
me
why
i
hardly
touched
you
pilla
answered
you
must
have
been
dreaming
well
it
is
no
dream
that
i
am
very
sore
said
inda
all
my
body
seems
covered
with
bruises
just
as
it
was
after
our
fight
under
the
tree
of
kuperee
that
is
queer
said
pilla
for
my
nose
also
feels
terribly
sore
that
must
have
been
a
mighty
blow
that
you
dealt
it
he
felt
it
tenderly
it
feels
queer
too
does
it
look
curious
there
is
a
furrow
down
it
but
then
there
always
has
been
since
our
fight
said
inda
you
look
not
much
worse
than
usual
but
i
see
is
there
anything
wrong
with
me
he
flung
off
his
rug
and
sat
up
pilla
uttered
a
cry
ky
you
are
all
over
spots
did
i
really
hit
you
in
all
those
places
you
must
have
done
so
said
inda
crossly
lucky
for
me
that
the
spears
were
blunt
i
feel
most
extraordinary
said
pilla
suddenly
it
is
just
as
though
i
were
shrinking
and
indeed
i
have
no
cause
to
shrink
seeing
how
much
i
ate
last
night
but
my
skin
is
getting
all
loose
and
mine
too
cried
inda
faintly
there
is
magic
at
work
upon
us
my
brother
then
a
mist
drifted
over
the
wurley
and
strange
cries
came
out
of
it
the
boys
watching
outside
clutched
at
each
other
in
fear
and
presently
when
the
mist
blew
away
pilla
and
inda
were
not
to
be
seen
nor
were
they
ever
seen
more
instead
within
the
wurley
crouched
two
little
animals
new
to
the
blacks
which
uttered
faint
squeaks
and
scurried
away
through
the
camp
into
the
bush
there
they
live
now
and
through
them
are
the
sons
of
burkamukk
remembered
pilla
is
the
plump
who
has
always
a
furrow
down
his
nose
and
inda
is
the
whose
skin
is
covered
all
over
with
spots
for
the
magic
of
kuperee
lived
after
him
so
that
the
blunt
weapons
that
had
struck
him
had
strange
power
just
as
there
was
power
of
life
in
the
stone
axe
that
had
killed
him
but
though
they
lived
no
longer
as
men
the
names
of
pilla
and
inda
were
always
held
in
great
honour
since
through
their
courage
and
wisdom
the
tribes
lived
in
security
free
from
the
wickedness
of
kuperee
ii
waung
the
crow
chapter
i
very
long
ago
so
long
that
the
oldest
blacks
could
not
remember
anything
about
it
themselves
there
was
a
legend
of
the
first
coming
of
fire
fire
came
with
a
group
of
seven
strange
women
the
who
brought
it
from
some
unknown
country
they
dwelt
with
the
blacks
and
showed
them
how
to
use
the
new
and
wonderful
thing
but
they
were
very
selfish
and
would
give
none
away
instead
they
kept
it
in
the
end
of
their
and
when
the
people
begged
for
it
they
only
laughed
at
them
they
alone
knew
how
to
make
it
and
they
never
told
the
secret
to
anyone
so
the
blacks
took
counsel
together
we
might
as
well
have
never
learned
that
there
was
fire
at
all
said
one
better
said
another
before
it
came
we
were
content
but
now
every
one
is
sighing
for
it
and
can
not
get
it
my
wife
is
a
weariness
to
me
said
a
third
always
she
pesters
me
to
bring
fire
to
her
and
makes
my
mouth
water
by
telling
me
of
the
beautiful
food
she
could
cook
if
she
had
it
it
is
almost
enough
to
make
a
man
lose
his
appetite
but
who
that
has
once
tasted
cooked
food
can
ever
forget
it
another
said
licking
his
lips
such
flavour
such
juiciness
twice
the
gave
fire
to
my
wife
and
let
her
roast
wallaby
and
snipe
and
since
those
glorious
meals
it
is
hard
to
eat
them
raw
ay
that
is
so
said
one
to
my
woman
also
they
gave
fire
twice
and
she
cooked
me
wombat
and
iguana
ky
how
much
i
ate
and
how
sick
i
was
afterwards
but
it
was
worth
it
and
fish
said
another
no
one
who
eats
raw
fish
can
imagine
what
a
difference
fire
makes
to
it
it
is
indeed
a
wonderful
thing
the
first
time
i
saw
it
i
picked
it
up
admiring
its
pretty
colour
and
it
stung
me
severely
in
my
wrath
i
kicked
it
but
its
sting
was
still
there
and
it
gave
me
a
very
sore
foot
now
i
know
that
it
is
magic
and
must
not
be
touched
save
with
a
stick
and
then
the
stick
becomes
part
of
it
it
is
all
very
curious
it
is
worse
than
curious
that
such
a
thing
should
be
and
be
held
only
by
the
power
of
women
said
an
old
man
angrily
if
we
had
fire
the
winter
cold
would
not
strike
so
keenly
to
old
bones
why
should
we
submit
to
these
women
the
let
us
kill
them
if
necessary
and
take
it
from
them
for
ourselves
but
no
one
moved
and
all
looked
uneasy
the
women
are
magic
said
one
at
length
the
know
that
yes
and
the
women
magic
is
stronger
than
theirs
another
answered
they
have
weaved
spells
but
what
good
have
they
done
now
they
say
that
unless
they
let
some
fire
drop
by
accident
we
can
never
get
it
from
them
and
if
they
do
let
it
fall
then
they
will
be
just
like
other
women
and
have
no
power
at
all
i
would
like
to
see
that
said
a
big
fellow
eagerly
it
would
be
very
good
for
them
and
they
would
make
useful
wives
for
some
of
us
for
they
know
all
about
cooking
food
i
would
not
mind
marrying
one
of
them
myself
he
added
in
a
patronizing
tone
at
which
everybody
laughed
another
big
man
spoke
his
name
was
waung
and
he
was
tall
and
powerful
it
is
all
very
ridiculous
he
said
no
woman
lives
in
the
world
who
can
get
the
better
of
a
man
i
have
half
a
mind
to
get
fire
from
them
myself
you
said
the
others
and
they
all
joined
in
roars
of
laughter
for
waung
was
a
lazy
man
and
had
never
done
much
good
for
himself
you
you
would
go
to
sleep
instead
of
finding
a
way
to
get
the
better
of
the
this
made
waung
very
angry
you
are
all
fools
he
said
rudely
i
will
certainly
take
the
trouble
to
get
fire
and
will
make
one
of
the
women
my
wife
and
she
shall
cook
in
my
wurley
but
then
i
will
have
their
magic
and
none
of
you
will
get
any
fire
from
me
of
that
you
may
be
sure
then
you
will
all
be
sorry
but
this
only
made
the
men
laugh
more
and
the
noise
of
their
mirth
set
the
shouting
in
the
trees
very
seldom
had
the
camp
heard
so
fine
a
joke
waung
was
filled
with
fury
he
strode
away
from
them
with
his
head
in
the
air
shouting
fierce
threats
no
one
took
the
least
notice
of
them
because
he
was
known
to
be
a
boaster
and
a
talker
but
it
was
very
amusing
to
see
him
go
and
the
blacks
were
always
glad
of
a
chance
for
laughter
even
after
waung
had
gone
into
his
wurley
he
could
hear
the
echo
of
their
merriment
and
whenever
two
or
three
went
past
they
were
still
talking
about
him
and
laughing
a
pity
waung
is
such
a
fool
they
said
but
perhaps
it
is
as
well
for
if
there
were
no
fools
we
would
not
have
such
good
jokes
and
that
did
not
make
waung
feel
any
better
next
day
he
went
to
the
wurley
and
met
them
going
out
to
dig
for
yams
their
were
on
their
shoulders
and
they
held
their
and
he
could
see
fire
gleaming
in
the
hollow
tops
waung
looked
at
the
digging
ends
of
the
sticks
and
saw
that
they
were
very
blunt
he
said
i
will
sharpen
your
for
you
the
thanked
him
with
a
twinkle
in
their
eyes
they
knew
there
was
some
reason
for
such
politeness
from
waung
so
they
held
the
for
him
to
cut
and
though
once
or
twice
he
tried
to
make
them
fall
as
if
by
accident
so
long
as
they
had
even
a
finger
upon
them
they
did
not
move
so
waung
realized
that
fire
was
not
to
be
obtained
in
that
way
when
he
had
finished
the
points
he
stood
up
i
am
sick
of
the
tribe
he
said
angrily
they
are
silly
people
and
they
turn
me
into
a
joke
if
you
like
i
will
come
out
and
help
you
to
get
food
and
i
can
tell
you
i
know
where
to
hunt
will
you
hunt
with
me
now
the
were
suspicious
of
waung
but
they
were
lazy
women
it
did
not
amuse
them
at
all
to
go
hunting
by
themselves
every
day
for
they
were
not
clever
at
it
and
it
took
them
a
long
time
to
find
enough
game
to
cook
moreover
they
were
fond
of
food
and
never
had
enough
they
knew
that
no
one
could
take
away
their
so
long
as
they
held
them
and
so
they
were
not
afraid
of
waung
perhaps
what
you
say
is
true
one
answered
slowly
at
any
rate
i
do
not
care
you
may
come
with
me
if
you
wish
and
sometimes
we
will
give
you
some
cooked
food
so
the
camp
got
used
to
the
sight
of
waung
and
the
women
going
out
to
hunt
together
and
after
a
while
they
forgot
that
they
used
to
laugh
at
them
and
they
had
to
find
another
joke
they
envied
waung
very
much
if
they
saw
him
eating
scraps
of
cooked
meat
given
him
by
the
women
and
you
may
be
sure
that
waung
did
not
give
any
scraps
away
he
became
quite
good
friends
with
the
women
though
they
were
always
suspicious
of
him
and
gave
him
no
chance
of
handling
their
the
fire
in
the
hollow
tops
never
went
out
waung
could
not
guess
how
they
managed
to
keep
it
alive
there
and
it
puzzled
him
very
much
but
he
never
forgot
that
he
had
vowed
to
take
it
from
them
and
he
made
many
plans
that
came
to
nothing
because
the
were
always
watchful
at
last
waung
hit
upon
an
idea
out
in
the
scrub
he
found
a
nest
of
young
snakes
and
these
he
managed
to
tame
for
he
was
a
very
cunning
man
even
when
they
were
nearly
they
would
do
his
bidding
and
he
taught
them
many
queer
tricks
then
he
went
in
search
of
an
and
sought
until
he
found
a
very
large
one
for
the
had
told
him
that
they
loved
ants
eggs
more
than
any
kind
of
food
one
night
waung
took
his
snakes
and
buried
them
in
the
saying
stay
there
until
i
send
to
let
you
out
they
looked
at
him
with
their
fierce
beady
eyes
and
wriggled
round
until
they
made
themselves
nests
in
the
soft
earth
which
caused
the
ants
very
great
inconvenience
and
alarm
then
waung
covered
them
up
and
went
home
taking
the
a
little
that
he
had
killed
the
women
were
hungry
and
the
sight
of
waung
offering
did
not
please
them
it
is
very
small
they
said
discontentedly
what
is
the
matter
with
you
you
have
brought
us
scarcely
any
food
for
three
days
waung
laughed
swinging
his
spear
hunting
has
been
bad
he
said
carelessly
i
have
been
lazy
perhaps
or
the
game
was
scarce
but
i
have
a
treat
for
you
what
is
that
they
asked
eagerly
looking
up
from
skinning
the
what
would
you
say
to
ants
eggs
we
like
them
more
than
anything
else
they
cried
have
you
found
some
i
have
found
a
very
big
hill
waung
said
it
should
be
full
of
eggs
and
you
will
take
us
there
waung
did
not
want
to
seem
too
eager
he
hesitated
i
do
not
want
the
eggs
he
said
at
length
a
man
wants
something
he
can
bite
eggs
are
for
women
but
will
you
cook
me
a
wallaby
if
i
take
you
there
where
is
the
wallaby
asked
the
i
have
not
caught
it
yet
but
i
have
set
a
snare
in
a
track
i
know
and
while
you
dig
ants
eggs
i
have
no
doubt
i
can
get
one
that
does
not
matter
however
i
can
get
one
some
time
will
you
cook
it
for
me
if
i
show
you
the
ants
nest
the
promised
for
the
temptation
of
the
ants
eggs
was
very
strong
they
ate
all
the
and
found
it
quite
too
small
for
their
appetites
so
they
went
to
sleep
hungry
and
were
still
hungrier
when
they
awoke
in
the
morning
they
had
only
a
few
yams
for
breakfast
and
so
they
were
very
eager
to
start
when
waung
sauntered
up
to
their
wurley
they
all
went
a
little
way
into
the
bush
and
then
came
upon
the
great
at
the
sight
the
ran
forward
with
their
sticks
ready
to
dig
waung
said
i
will
go
on
to
my
snare
and
come
back
to
you
but
he
went
slowly
the
women
had
not
taken
any
notice
of
what
he
said
they
plunged
their
into
the
hill
and
began
throwing
out
the
earth
quickly
then
they
uttered
a
loud
scream
for
the
snakes
came
tumbling
out
of
the
loosened
earth
and
ran
this
way
and
that
hissing
fiercely
and
some
ran
at
them
waung
turned
back
at
their
cries
hit
them
with
your
sticks
he
shouted
kill
them
the
hit
furiously
at
the
snakes
with
the
pointed
end
of
their
but
a
stiff
pointed
stick
is
not
much
use
for
killing
snakes
as
waung
well
knew
and
he
called
to
them
roughly
that
is
no
good
use
the
thick
ends
the
women
swung
their
sticks
round
at
his
cry
and
brought
the
thick
ends
down
across
the
snakes
backs
the
blows
were
so
strong
that
many
of
the
snakes
were
killed
at
once
but
that
was
not
the
only
thing
that
happened
fire
flew
out
of
the
hollow
ends
of
the
sticks
and
in
great
coals
rolled
down
the
side
of
the
the
coals
met
and
joined
so
that
they
were
all
one
very
large
coal
waung
had
been
watching
like
a
cat
he
had
picked
up
two
flat
pieces
of
green
and
now
he
leaped
forward
snapped
up
fire
between
them
and
fled
behind
him
came
the
screaming
but
as
waung
stole
the
fire
their
magic
left
them
and
they
were
helpless
then
the
who
carries
the
whirlwind
in
his
bag
heard
the
voice
of
speaking
to
him
out
of
the
clouds
commanding
him
to
let
loose
his
burden
so
obedient
but
greatly
afraid
untied
the
strings
of
his
bag
and
the
whirlwind
leapt
out
with
a
wild
rush
it
caught
the
and
whirled
them
up
into
the
sky
where
you
may
still
see
them
clustered
together
for
they
were
turned
into
stars
now
they
are
called
the
pleiades
or
seven
sisters
but
the
blacks
know
that
they
are
the
women
and
that
they
live
together
in
the
sky
still
carrying
fire
on
the
ends
of
their
illustration
it
caught
the
and
whirled
them
up
into
the
sky
chapter
ii
waung
went
proudly
back
to
the
tribe
and
when
they
saw
that
he
had
actually
stolen
fire
from
the
women
they
were
both
glad
and
astonished
and
clustered
round
him
calling
him
many
pleasant
things
waung
was
quite
ready
to
listen
to
them
but
he
had
no
intention
of
being
generous
now
that
he
had
brought
fire
with
him
he
saw
his
way
to
a
lazy
life
and
he
was
not
the
man
to
lose
such
a
good
chance
so
after
they
had
praised
him
very
loudly
and
sung
loud
songs
about
his
bravery
and
wit
he
went
off
into
his
wurley
and
put
fire
in
a
hole
in
the
ground
then
he
sat
in
the
doorway
and
carved
a
boomerang
the
people
looked
at
each
other
not
knowing
what
to
do
next
how
is
this
they
said
will
he
not
give
fire
to
us
all
no
one
could
answer
this
question
they
chattered
together
for
a
while
then
one
said
what
is
worth
having
is
worth
asking
for
and
he
went
up
to
waung
wurley
and
greeted
him
civilly
waung
he
said
will
you
give
me
some
fire
to
do
my
cooking
i
have
only
enough
for
myself
said
waung
and
went
on
with
his
carving
but
fire
grows
if
you
will
let
it
said
the
man
will
you
not
make
it
grow
so
that
each
of
us
may
have
some
i
can
not
spare
any
was
all
that
waung
would
answer
so
the
man
went
back
to
his
friends
and
told
them
what
waung
said
then
one
after
another
came
to
waung
and
begged
him
for
a
little
bit
of
fire
but
the
reply
was
always
the
same
and
they
went
away
very
sorry
that
they
had
ever
laughed
at
waung
for
now
he
remembered
the
laughter
and
he
determined
to
have
his
revenge
in
the
morning
when
the
tribe
was
astir
they
found
that
waung
had
made
a
very
large
oven
in
front
of
his
wurley
and
had
hid
fire
there
also
he
had
caught
a
wallaby
in
his
snare
and
all
the
air
was
full
of
the
fragrant
smell
of
cooking
it
made
all
the
people
mouths
water
and
they
hated
waung
exceedingly
but
they
feared
that
with
the
fire
waung
had
also
captured
their
magic
and
so
they
did
not
dare
to
attack
him
so
they
held
a
council
together
and
all
talked
very
fast
and
angrily
but
at
the
end
of
it
there
was
nothing
accomplished
talking
did
not
mend
the
matter
at
all
and
against
magic
what
could
anyone
do
then
a
woman
came
running
and
said
she
had
a
message
and
though
women
were
not
supposed
to
speak
in
council
she
was
told
to
deliver
it
at
once
waung
says
he
will
cook
our
food
said
she
and
stopped
for
breath
a
great
shout
of
joy
went
up
from
the
men
but
he
will
not
do
it
for
nothing
went
on
the
woman
at
this
all
their
faces
lengthened
suddenly
the
blacks
stopped
in
the
middle
of
their
joyful
shout
and
waited
with
their
mouths
wide
open
to
hear
what
was
to
follow
he
says
he
will
cook
for
us
but
we
are
to
supply
him
with
food
and
firewood
and
all
that
he
wants
and
he
will
keep
for
himself
all
the
food
he
likes
best
and
if
we
do
not
perform
all
that
he
tells
us
to
do
he
will
take
fire
away
altogether
there
was
silence
when
the
woman
had
finished
speaking
and
then
a
deep
groan
of
anger
went
up
from
the
people
they
all
talked
very
fast
again
each
trying
to
speak
more
loudly
than
the
others
all
except
the
husband
of
the
woman
who
had
brought
the
news
and
he
was
busy
beating
her
with
his
waddy
because
she
had
brought
so
insolent
a
message
and
had
allowed
them
to
think
at
first
that
it
was
good
news
the
poor
lubra
tried
to
say
that
they
had
not
given
her
time
to
say
it
all
at
once
but
the
husband
was
too
busy
to
listen
but
neither
talking
nor
beating
made
the
matter
any
better
so
waung
became
the
real
ruler
of
the
tribe
in
everything
but
name
since
food
is
the
most
important
thing
in
the
world
to
the
blacks
and
the
greater
part
of
their
food
became
dependent
upon
him
nothing
could
be
cooked
unless
waung
would
do
it
and
they
soon
found
that
unless
he
were
in
a
good
temper
he
would
not
do
it
at
all
he
took
the
best
parts
of
all
that
they
brought
to
him
to
cook
so
that
no
man
knew
what
he
would
get
back
and
when
one
took
a
fat
young
wallaby
or
a
black
duck
it
was
quite
likely
that
waung
would
give
him
something
tough
and
stringy
when
he
went
back
for
his
cooked
meal
declaring
that
it
was
what
he
had
left
in
his
oven
neither
would
he
take
any
trouble
over
the
cooking
the
people
brought
their
food
and
put
it
in
the
oven
themselves
and
waung
took
it
out
when
it
pleased
him
sometimes
he
did
not
take
it
out
until
it
was
burned
black
and
tasteless
while
at
others
they
would
find
it
only
and
cold
but
no
amount
of
talking
would
make
waung
alter
his
ways
and
at
last
he
became
so
proud
that
if
anyone
argued
with
him
he
would
refuse
to
cook
for
a
week
except
for
himself
this
naturally
stopped
all
argument
in
the
camp
but
it
did
not
make
the
people
love
waung
any
better
he
grew
very
fat
and
lazy
for
he
ate
huge
quantities
of
food
and
very
seldom
went
out
of
his
wurley
when
he
did
he
carried
fire
with
him
in
a
little
hollow
stick
and
no
one
dared
go
near
him
or
near
his
wurley
for
fear
of
his
enchantments
as
a
matter
of
fact
waung
had
no
enchantments
at
all
and
no
magic
but
he
was
very
cunning
and
he
knew
how
easy
it
was
to
make
the
blacks
think
he
had
amazing
powers
the
too
found
that
none
of
their
spells
had
any
effect
upon
waung
and
so
they
told
the
tribe
that
he
certainly
had
magic
help
it
was
very
convenient
to
be
able
to
say
this
when
they
were
beaten
for
magic
was
a
thing
that
could
not
possibly
be
argued
about
the
months
went
by
and
the
people
became
very
unhappy
waung
evil
temper
made
them
all
miserable
and
afraid
there
have
been
many
bad
kings
in
history
but
only
waung
ever
had
the
power
of
depriving
all
his
people
of
their
dinner
if
they
failed
to
please
him
it
is
a
very
terrible
punishment
when
it
is
inflicted
often
especially
when
dinner
is
the
only
meal
of
the
day
now
that
the
people
had
grown
used
to
cooked
food
they
did
not
like
raw
meat
so
they
depended
on
mercy
and
waung
had
very
little
mercy
it
amused
him
greatly
to
see
the
people
hungry
and
to
have
them
come
begging
to
him
to
cook
their
food
he
would
laugh
loud
and
long
reminding
them
of
the
time
when
they
had
jeered
at
him
about
fire
afterwards
he
would
go
into
his
wurley
and
sleep
saying
fire
is
asleep
and
i
can
not
wake
it
at
last
maker
of
men
looked
down
at
the
world
and
saw
how
unhappy
the
blacks
were
under
the
cruelties
of
waung
it
made
him
very
angry
he
was
stern
and
hard
himself
but
he
saw
no
reason
why
this
fellow
lazy
and
should
make
his
people
hungry
and
miserable
so
he
sent
a
message
to
the
ear
of
each
man
in
the
tribe
telling
him
what
to
do
the
blacks
thought
they
had
dreamed
the
message
they
woke
in
the
morning
confused
and
angry
they
hardly
knew
why
and
each
man
said
to
his
neighbour
i
have
dreamed
about
waung
and
the
other
would
answer
i
too
have
dreamed
about
him
they
gathered
into
groups
talking
about
waung
and
about
the
dream
that
had
come
to
them
and
then
the
groups
began
to
drift
towards
waung
wurley
waung
looked
out
and
saw
them
coming
at
once
he
became
uneasy
for
he
knew
that
he
had
never
seen
such
threatening
faces
and
angry
eyes
it
made
him
afraid
and
he
began
to
put
fire
to
heat
his
oven
which
had
been
cold
for
five
days
the
blacks
came
close
to
the
wurley
growling
and
muttering
they
circled
round
still
then
one
suddenly
becoming
brave
shouted
a
word
of
angry
abuse
at
waung
and
that
was
all
the
others
wanted
they
joined
the
first
man
in
loud
and
threatening
shouts
and
fierce
abuse
casting
at
him
every
evil
name
they
could
think
of
and
saying
that
the
time
had
come
for
him
to
answer
for
his
bad
deeds
then
one
picked
up
a
stone
and
flung
it
at
him
hitting
him
on
the
shoulder
waung
had
no
weapons
outside
his
wurley
he
became
terrified
gazing
round
him
with
hopeless
eyes
that
saw
no
way
of
escape
then
he
stooped
to
his
oven
and
saw
that
fire
lay
there
in
a
mass
of
red
coals
i
will
give
you
back
fire
he
shouted
he
thrust
a
flat
stone
into
the
coals
and
with
it
flung
fire
far
and
wide
among
the
blacks
some
of
it
hit
the
men
and
burned
them
as
he
hoped
but
others
picked
it
up
and
ran
with
it
to
their
wurleys
so
that
they
might
never
again
be
without
it
in
their
homes
to
and
fro
in
the
air
the
burning
pieces
flew
as
waung
hurled
them
from
him
so
fast
they
fell
that
the
people
were
almost
afraid
again
it
seemed
as
though
waung
were
making
fire
so
that
he
might
fight
them
with
it
and
then
a
strange
thing
happened
all
the
coals
that
had
fallen
in
the
dry
grass
nearest
the
wurley
turned
and
began
to
burn
back
towards
waung
they
met
in
a
circle
of
flame
gradually
it
burned
until
it
came
to
the
wurley
and
there
it
wrapped
waung
and
his
oven
and
all
that
belonged
to
him
in
a
sheet
of
flame
out
of
it
came
waung
dreadful
cries
for
help
but
no
man
dared
go
near
the
fire
nor
would
anyone
have
lifted
a
finger
to
help
waung
the
people
huddled
together
watching
in
great
fear
soon
the
cries
ceased
and
then
the
smoke
and
flame
died
away
so
that
they
saw
the
body
of
waung
lying
across
the
stones
of
his
oven
he
was
quite
black
like
a
cinder
the
tribe
uttered
a
long
shout
of
triumph
for
they
knew
that
he
could
trouble
them
no
more
then
they
heard
the
voice
of
speaking
to
the
thing
that
lay
across
the
stones
fire
has
made
you
black
said
the
voice
now
you
shall
be
black
for
ever
and
no
longer
a
man
instead
you
shall
be
a
crow
to
fly
about
for
ever
and
utter
cries
so
that
when
the
people
see
you
they
will
remember
how
they
were
foolishly
in
bondage
to
you
and
your
cruelties
the
people
cast
themselves
down
in
terror
at
the
voice
a
drifting
cloud
of
smoke
floated
from
the
smouldering
ashes
of
the
wurley
and
blotted
everything
out
when
they
looked
again
it
had
lifted
and
blown
away
into
the
skies
the
thing
that
had
lain
on
the
stones
was
no
longer
there
but
from
the
limb
of
a
boobyalla
tree
close
by
came
a
harsh
croak
and
looking
they
saw
a
big
black
crow
that
flapped
its
wings
and
looked
at
them
with
sullen
eyes
then
it
said
and
rising
from
the
tree
it
flew
lazily
across
to
a
great
blackbutt
where
it
perched
on
the
topmost
bough
still
croaking
evilly
and
the
people
glad
yet
afraid
clustered
together
muttering
see
it
is
waung
iii
the
emu
who
would
dance
long
ago
kari
the
emu
was
superior
to
all
other
birds
she
was
so
superior
that
she
would
not
live
on
the
earth
instead
she
had
a
home
up
in
the
clouds
and
from
there
she
used
to
look
down
at
the
earth
and
the
queer
antics
of
all
the
things
that
lived
there
it
gave
her
much
food
for
thought
at
that
time
there
were
no
human
beings
at
all
all
the
earth
was
inhabited
by
animals
birds
and
reptiles
and
they
lived
very
happily
together
as
a
rule
there
were
no
wars
and
every
one
had
enough
to
eat
while
there
were
no
men
fear
did
not
live
on
earth
either
all
the
world
was
a
big
where
even
the
smallest
and
weakest
could
find
a
peaceful
home
kari
sitting
in
her
great
nest
up
in
the
clouds
watched
the
animals
below
both
night
and
day
she
thought
them
strange
creatures
and
wondered
very
much
how
they
could
be
so
contented
with
so
many
other
creatures
about
them
she
was
so
used
to
living
alone
that
it
seemed
to
her
rather
unpleasant
to
have
one
solitude
broken
upon
by
others
all
of
whom
might
be
peculiar
enough
to
think
their
little
affairs
as
interesting
as
one
own
kari
thought
that
nothing
could
possibly
be
so
interesting
as
her
great
lonely
nest
in
the
clouds
in
reality
it
was
a
very
dull
old
nest
and
she
was
a
big
dull
bird
she
knew
no
one
and
spoke
to
no
one
and
thought
only
her
own
queer
thoughts
but
she
did
not
know
she
was
dull
and
so
she
was
quite
happy
one
day
she
sat
in
her
nest
watching
the
drift
about
between
her
and
the
world
they
cleared
away
after
a
while
and
she
looked
down
upon
a
great
forest
over
which
she
found
herself
for
as
her
nest
was
in
a
cloud
it
used
to
float
about
and
so
she
never
knew
what
country
she
might
see
when
she
looked
down
sometimes
it
was
a
lake
sometimes
a
mountain
and
sometimes
the
great
rolling
sea
which
always
made
her
feel
rather
giddy
because
it
would
not
keep
still
for
a
moment
but
on
this
day
it
was
a
wide
forest
green
and
peaceful
kari
sight
was
very
keen
and
she
looked
through
the
to
the
ground
below
and
saw
all
the
animals
it
was
really
almost
as
good
as
a
circus
but
then
kari
knew
nothing
about
such
a
thing
as
a
circus
she
watched
them
with
great
interest
leaning
her
long
neck
over
the
edge
of
the
cloud
in
which
her
nest
was
built
suddenly
she
saw
a
sight
that
made
her
lean
forward
so
far
that
she
very
nearly
overbalanced
and
fell
out
far
below
her
was
an
open
space
near
a
bright
spot
that
she
knew
was
water
in
a
little
swampy
place
in
a
hollow
the
grass
there
was
green
and
soft
there
were
trees
all
round
it
and
it
was
a
very
secluded
place
except
for
anyone
looking
from
above
like
the
inquisitive
kari
but
kari
was
not
looking
only
at
green
grass
and
shining
water
she
saw
a
little
group
of
birds
that
had
come
out
of
the
swamp
where
they
had
been
wading
and
had
begun
to
dance
they
were
native
companions
puralkas
but
kari
did
not
know
that
all
she
knew
was
that
they
were
very
beautiful
creatures
the
most
beautiful
she
thought
that
she
had
ever
seen
and
they
were
doing
the
most
interesting
things
very
gracefully
they
danced
to
and
fro
on
the
patch
of
green
grass
they
were
tall
slim
birds
looking
a
kind
of
dim
grey
colour
when
seen
so
far
away
their
legs
were
very
long
and
thin
for
they
belonged
to
the
tribe
of
birds
called
waders
who
get
their
food
by
walking
in
swamps
and
morasses
and
they
had
neat
bodies
not
fluffy
like
some
of
kari
own
feathers
with
which
she
immediately
felt
very
dissatisfied
their
queer
thin
heads
with
long
beaks
were
carried
on
long
necks
which
twisted
about
as
they
danced
they
pranced
up
and
down
giving
little
runs
backwards
and
forwards
marching
and
stepping
in
the
most
curious
manner
never
had
kari
seen
so
charming
a
sight
it
made
her
suddenly
envious
until
now
she
had
regarded
all
the
animals
and
birds
as
so
much
beneath
her
in
every
way
that
it
never
occurred
to
her
to
wish
to
be
like
them
or
to
do
anything
that
they
did
but
this
was
the
first
time
that
she
had
seen
the
native
companions
dance
kari
cloud
drifted
away
presently
and
she
could
no
longer
see
the
queer
grey
company
of
birds
prancing
on
the
green
spot
in
the
forest
but
nothing
that
now
came
within
her
sight
interested
her
at
all
she
saw
the
building
their
mounds
in
the
bush
and
making
them
gay
with
all
sorts
of
odd
things
bright
stones
bits
of
quartz
gay
feathers
and
they
also
danced
on
their
mounds
but
it
did
not
please
kari
as
much
as
the
dance
of
the
puralkas
the
moon
showed
her
the
animals
that
come
out
at
night
wombat
wallaby
wild
dogs
and
opossums
native
bears
climbing
up
the
highest
trees
and
that
trailed
like
clouds
between
her
and
the
she
saw
the
lizards
that
live
in
rocks
and
on
the
ground
and
the
hideous
iguanas
that
run
up
the
trees
great
flocks
of
screaming
cockatoos
made
the
air
white
as
they
flew
the
sun
gleaming
on
their
yellow
crests
there
were
snakes
too
in
the
bush
great
brown
and
black
fellows
and
the
wicked
with
its
back
and
its
quick
cruel
movements
once
it
had
amused
kari
very
much
to
see
the
jackass
merkein
swoop
down
upon
a
snake
and
carry
it
struggling
back
into
a
tree
the
jackass
was
a
silent
bird
then
and
never
made
any
fuss
over
his
captures
still
it
was
exciting
to
see
him
catch
snakes
but
now
kari
found
that
none
of
these
things
interested
or
amused
her
any
more
all
she
wanted
to
see
again
was
the
puralkas
come
out
of
their
swamp
and
dance
upon
the
grass
she
watched
for
a
long
time
hoping
always
to
catch
sight
of
them
again
but
though
her
cloud
drifted
over
all
kinds
of
country
she
could
not
find
the
puralkas
until
at
last
one
day
as
she
leaned
out
to
her
great
joy
the
little
green
space
came
below
her
again
and
there
were
the
birds
dancing
backwards
and
forwards
as
they
had
done
before
she
watched
them
breathlessly
until
her
cloud
began
to
float
away
and
then
she
decided
in
her
mind
that
she
could
not
bear
to
let
them
go
again
indeed
she
knew
now
that
unless
she
could
do
as
they
did
she
would
never
feel
happy
any
more
i
have
seen
all
there
is
in
the
world
she
said
and
nothing
is
half
so
beautiful
as
dancing
i
know
i
could
dance
far
better
than
the
puralkas
if
i
only
knew
the
way
i
will
go
down
and
get
them
to
teach
me
how
to
dance
then
i
can
fly
back
to
my
cloud
and
for
ever
after
i
shall
not
need
to
look
at
the
world
for
i
shall
be
too
happy
dancing
on
the
clouds
so
kari
spread
her
great
wings
and
floated
down
the
sky
until
she
came
over
the
little
green
space
among
the
trees
then
she
dropped
gently
and
finally
landed
in
the
swamp
which
she
did
not
like
at
all
because
she
had
never
before
had
her
feet
wet
nor
were
they
made
for
wading
in
the
soft
mud
of
a
swamp
she
scrambled
out
as
quickly
as
she
could
folding
her
wings
over
her
back
the
puralkas
had
run
back
to
the
edge
of
their
little
when
they
saw
the
great
brown
bird
coming
down
from
the
sky
at
first
they
were
inclined
to
fly
away
but
they
were
inquisitive
birds
and
they
waited
to
see
what
she
would
do
though
they
were
quite
prepared
for
flight
if
she
proved
to
be
alarming
but
the
emu
looked
so
simple
and
meek
and
she
was
so
comically
upset
at
getting
her
feet
wet
that
the
puralkas
saw
at
once
that
there
was
no
cause
for
fear
as
they
were
not
afraid
they
became
rather
angry
for
they
did
not
like
strangers
to
see
them
dancing
so
they
clustered
together
and
watched
her
with
unfriendly
eyes
as
she
struggled
out
of
the
mud
and
wiped
her
feet
upon
the
grass
how
are
you
she
said
rather
breathlessly
i
have
been
watching
you
all
from
my
home
in
the
clouds
and
i
think
you
are
nice
little
birds
now
this
made
the
puralkas
exactly
seventeen
times
more
angry
than
before
they
believed
that
they
were
quite
the
most
beautiful
birds
that
ever
wore
feathers
and
it
made
them
furious
to
be
addressed
in
this
patronizing
manner
who
was
this
awkward
brown
monster
of
a
bird
to
drop
out
of
nowhere
and
talk
to
them
as
if
she
were
a
queen
they
chattered
among
themselves
in
a
whisper
she
is
as
ugly
as
a
said
one
did
ever
anyone
see
such
great
coarse
feet
another
whispered
and
her
legs
why
they
are
as
thick
as
the
trunk
of
a
and
what
a
great
silly
head
she
is
larger
than
a
big
rock
but
she
is
more
foolish
than
a
coot
said
another
one
look
at
her
will
tell
you
that
she
has
no
sense
and
what
is
that
ridiculous
thing
she
said
about
a
home
in
the
clouds
one
asked
as
if
we
did
not
know
that
there
is
nothing
in
the
clouds
except
rain
why
the
big
eagle
flew
up
nearly
to
the
sun
the
other
day
and
yet
he
saw
nothing
of
nests
in
the
clouds
said
another
she
must
think
we
are
very
simple
to
come
to
us
with
such
a
tale
no
one
could
possibly
think
us
simple
unless
she
were
mad
said
another
every
one
knows
that
we
are
the
wisest
birds
in
all
the
bush
she
means
to
insult
us
and
they
all
glared
at
the
emu
much
as
if
she
were
a
poor
kari
felt
very
puzzled
and
unhappy
she
felt
that
she
had
done
a
kind
and
condescending
thing
in
coming
down
to
earth
and
talking
so
sweetly
to
these
smaller
birds
and
she
could
not
make
out
why
they
should
look
at
her
with
such
angry
eyes
she
rubbed
her
muddy
feet
on
the
grass
and
began
to
wish
that
she
had
never
left
her
nest
in
the
cloud
do
you
not
speak
my
language
she
asked
at
last
why
do
you
not
answer
me
the
puralkas
put
their
heads
together
again
and
whispered
finally
an
old
puralka
stepped
forward
with
mincing
steps
and
looked
her
up
and
down
so
that
kari
actually
blushed
we
know
what
you
say
but
we
do
not
know
why
you
say
it
said
the
old
puralka
why
should
you
want
to
know
how
we
are
and
how
dare
you
call
us
nice
little
birds
we
do
not
know
what
you
are
you
are
something
like
a
bird
to
be
sure
but
in
most
ways
you
are
a
kind
of
freak
at
any
rate
we
have
no
love
for
strangers
the
unfortunate
kari
moved
her
big
head
from
side
to
side
and
looked
at
the
old
puralka
in
amazement
her
beak
opened
slowly
but
she
was
too
surprised
to
speak
nothing
like
this
had
ever
occurred
to
her
when
she
lived
in
the
sky
as
for
your
extraordinary
remark
about
a
home
in
the
clouds
we
would
like
to
remind
you
that
we
were
not
hatched
yesterday
went
on
the
old
puralka
not
even
the
swallows
nest
in
the
clouds
you
are
only
wasting
your
time
and
we
have
none
to
waste
on
you
would
you
mind
going
away
we
want
to
get
on
with
our
dancing
kari
did
not
know
what
to
say
her
bewildered
eyes
glanced
from
one
puralka
to
another
and
finding
no
friendly
face
came
back
to
the
old
bird
who
stood
waiting
for
her
to
answer
or
go
away
she
had
never
dreamed
of
anything
like
this
among
her
drifting
clouds
and
her
first
instinct
was
to
spread
her
wings
and
fly
back
until
she
found
her
own
peaceful
nest
but
the
puralka
mention
of
dancing
reminded
her
of
what
had
brought
her
to
earth
and
she
felt
again
all
the
old
longing
to
watch
the
grey
birds
dance
so
she
summoned
up
her
courage
of
which
she
possessed
surprisingly
little
considering
her
size
i
sure
i
do
know
why
you
should
be
so
annoyed
she
said
meekly
i
mean
well
and
it
grieves
me
that
i
have
offended
you
it
was
because
i
thought
you
nice
little
birds
that
i
called
you
so
but
of
course
i
do
not
think
so
now
that
is
i
mean
i
she
broke
off
for
the
old
puralka
had
uttered
something
like
a
snort
and
was
regarding
her
with
a
fixed
expression
of
wrath
and
all
the
other
puralkas
had
bristled
alarmingly
oh
i
do
know
what
i
really
mean
said
poor
kari
helplessly
you
all
look
at
me
so
unpleasantly
and
it
is
quite
true
that
i
have
a
nest
in
the
clouds
if
you
will
come
up
i
will
show
it
to
you
i
live
there
always
and
i
have
only
come
down
because
i
hoped
that
you
would
teach
me
to
dance
there
was
silence
for
a
moment
and
then
all
the
puralkas
began
to
laugh
they
laughed
so
much
that
they
could
not
stand
they
went
reeling
round
the
little
green
patch
and
at
last
they
sat
down
with
their
legs
sticking
out
straight
in
front
of
them
and
laughed
more
and
more
meanwhile
kari
stood
looking
at
them
stupidly
she
felt
that
it
was
not
pleasant
laughter
at
last
they
ceased
to
laugh
and
putting
all
their
heads
together
began
to
whisper
this
went
on
so
long
that
after
a
while
kari
grew
tired
of
standing
and
so
she
sat
down
and
watched
them
feeling
very
unhappy
overhead
a
jackass
perched
on
a
big
and
looked
at
the
group
with
his
wise
old
head
on
one
side
when
they
had
whispered
for
a
long
time
the
puralkas
got
up
and
stood
in
a
row
with
their
wings
tightly
folded
over
their
backs
the
old
puralka
came
forward
you
must
excuse
us
for
laughing
she
said
her
voice
was
not
rude
now
but
there
was
something
in
it
that
made
kari
feel
as
uncomfortable
as
she
had
felt
when
she
had
been
rude
before
we
did
not
mean
to
hurt
your
feelings
but
we
all
thought
of
something
funny
we
saw
last
month
and
so
we
had
to
laugh
if
kari
had
been
less
simple
she
would
have
known
that
this
was
only
said
out
of
politeness
but
she
was
very
anxious
to
make
friends
so
she
looked
gratefully
at
the
old
puralka
and
said
timidly
that
she
was
glad
they
were
so
merry
quite
so
said
the
puralka
it
is
a
poor
heart
that
never
rejoices
but
about
dancing
that
is
a
different
matter
you
see
you
have
wings
eh
said
the
emu
stupidly
why
of
course
i
have
wings
why
not
well
that
is
the
difficulty
said
the
puralka
dancing
like
ours
is
the
most
beautiful
thing
in
the
world
of
course
but
no
one
with
wings
can
learn
it
you
see
we
have
none
ourselves
the
emu
gave
a
quick
look
at
the
puralkas
standing
in
a
row
they
had
folded
their
wings
so
tightly
over
their
neat
bodies
that
it
looked
as
though
they
had
really
none
at
all
and
she
looked
so
hard
at
their
bodies
that
she
did
not
notice
how
cunning
their
eyes
were
why
i
never
noticed
that
yours
were
gone
she
said
dear
me
how
sad
do
you
not
find
it
very
uncomfortable
and
awkward
no
why
should
we
snapped
the
puralka
wings
are
really
not
much
use
when
you
once
get
accustomed
to
doing
without
them
dancing
is
much
better
but
why
can
not
one
have
both
asked
kari
simply
said
the
old
puralka
crossly
we
do
not
know
why
these
things
are
and
we
never
ask
foolish
questions
about
them
but
if
you
wish
to
learn
our
beautiful
dancing
you
must
give
up
your
wings
first
give
up
my
wings
i
could
never
do
that
cried
kari
well
dancing
is
better
but
it
is
for
you
to
say
said
the
old
puralka
as
she
spoke
she
made
a
sign
to
the
others
and
they
began
to
dance
swaying
forward
until
they
almost
touched
kari
and
then
backwards
again
then
the
line
broke
up
into
circles
and
figures
and
they
danced
round
the
emu
until
her
head
grew
dizzy
with
their
movements
and
she
felt
that
to
dance
so
well
was
even
better
than
to
have
wings
to
and
fro
they
went
faster
and
faster
until
she
could
scarcely
distinguish
one
from
another
and
their
long
thin
legs
she
could
hardly
see
at
all
then
quite
suddenly
they
all
stopped
and
kari
blinked
at
them
and
could
not
speak
well
asked
the
old
puralka
watching
her
closely
do
you
not
think
that
wings
are
only
a
small
price
to
pay
for
such
dancing
could
you
teach
me
kari
asked
easily
if
you
give
up
your
wings
kari
gave
a
great
sigh
very
well
she
said
i
can
not
live
without
knowing
how
to
dance
as
you
do
then
spread
your
wings
out
on
this
stone
said
the
puralka
so
kari
spread
her
great
wings
across
the
stone
and
the
puralkas
cut
them
off
quite
close
to
her
body
with
their
sharp
beaks
then
they
said
stand
up
kari
stood
up
feeling
very
naked
and
queer
without
her
wings
then
the
puralkas
began
to
dance
again
faster
and
faster
and
they
danced
upon
her
that
had
been
cut
off
scattering
them
with
their
feet
until
there
were
not
two
left
together
and
the
wind
came
and
took
the
feathers
so
that
they
floated
away
over
the
tops
of
the
trees
and
mounted
out
of
sight
then
the
puralkas
laughed
again
just
as
they
had
laughed
before
until
kari
head
rang
with
the
noise
of
it
when
will
you
teach
me
she
asked
timidly
teach
you
cried
the
puralkas
what
a
joke
what
a
joke
they
burst
out
laughing
again
then
to
kari
amazement
they
unfolded
their
wings
and
shook
them
in
her
face
the
whole
green
patch
of
grass
was
full
of
the
fluttering
of
the
long
grey
wings
you
said
you
had
none
she
cried
what
a
joke
what
a
joke
screamed
the
puralkas
flapping
her
with
their
wings
they
spun
round
and
round
her
their
long
legs
dancing
madly
and
their
wings
quivering
and
fluttering
then
they
suddenly
mounted
into
the
air
circled
about
her
once
or
twice
and
flew
away
through
the
trees
the
sound
of
their
wicked
laughter
grew
fainter
and
fainter
until
it
died
away
kari
sat
down
and
put
her
head
down
on
the
ground
after
a
while
she
got
up
and
tried
to
fly
but
the
little
stumps
of
her
wings
would
not
raise
her
an
inch
from
the
earth
and
very
soon
she
ceased
to
try
she
sat
down
again
later
on
she
stood
up
and
began
to
try
to
dance
as
the
puralkas
had
done
she
moved
her
great
feet
in
the
same
way
and
tried
to
sway
about
but
it
was
useless
she
looked
so
comical
hopping
round
on
her
thick
legs
that
the
jackass
which
had
all
the
time
sat
in
the
overhead
broke
into
a
great
shout
of
laughter
and
all
the
bush
rang
with
the
sound
screamed
the
jackass
kari
is
trying
to
dance
look
at
her
there
never
was
anything
half
so
funny
then
kari
knew
that
she
had
lost
her
wings
for
nothing
that
she
could
never
dance
like
the
puralkas
and
that
worst
of
all
she
could
never
go
back
to
her
nest
in
the
clouds
she
could
not
bear
the
harsh
laughter
of
the
jackass
and
so
she
ran
away
her
long
legs
taking
great
strides
crashing
into
the
undergrowth
of
the
bush
then
the
jackass
flew
away
still
chuckling
to
himself
that
anyone
could
be
so
stupid
soon
the
little
green
patch
of
grass
was
quite
deserted
until
the
sun
set
when
the
cruel
puralkas
came
flying
back
to
it
and
danced
again
but
kari
never
came
to
it
so
the
emu
lives
on
earth
and
has
forgotten
all
about
the
nest
she
once
had
in
the
drifting
clouds
she
has
no
friends
among
the
birds
for
though
she
is
a
bird
herself
she
has
no
wings
and
can
not
fly
she
has
taught
herself
to
run
very
fast
and
to
kick
with
her
big
feet
so
that
it
is
not
wise
to
make
her
angry
because
she
used
to
live
in
the
clouds
and
had
no
proper
training
she
will
eat
the
most
extraordinary
things
stones
and
nails
and
pieces
of
iron
and
glass
which
the
blacks
have
brought
into
the
bush
but
they
never
seem
to
disagree
with
her
she
is
not
a
very
happy
bird
for
all
the
time
she
keeps
hoping
that
her
wings
will
grow
long
again
and
that
she
will
be
able
to
fly
back
to
find
her
but
they
never
grow
always
since
then
merkein
the
jackass
has
been
able
to
laugh
he
is
called
the
laughing
jackass
because
of
this
he
has
been
a
merry
fellow
ever
since
he
sat
on
the
and
watched
kari
trying
to
dance
after
the
cruel
puralkas
had
robbed
her
of
her
wings
and
left
her
far
away
from
her
nest
in
the
white
clouds
iv
booran
the
pelican
chapter
i
long
ago
black
people
were
scattered
all
over
the
earth
and
the
forests
and
plains
were
full
of
them
but
a
great
flood
came
for
weeks
it
rained
all
day
and
all
night
until
nearly
all
the
plains
were
great
swamps
then
the
snow
was
washed
from
the
hills
and
the
rivers
and
creeks
overflowed
their
banks
and
swept
over
the
country
there
was
scarcely
anything
to
be
seen
except
the
tops
of
the
tallest
trees
sticking
out
of
the
waters
that
covered
the
land
all
the
camps
were
washed
away
and
nearly
all
the
people
were
drowned
in
one
tribe
the
only
people
left
alive
were
a
man
and
three
women
their
camp
was
near
a
river
and
when
the
flood
came
and
the
river
rose
and
washed
away
the
wurleys
they
clung
to
a
great
log
that
lay
upon
the
bank
it
was
so
huge
a
log
that
they
did
not
think
any
flood
would
ever
move
it
but
they
had
seen
only
little
floods
and
they
did
not
know
what
the
river
could
do
when
it
rose
in
its
wrath
the
water
crept
higher
and
higher
as
they
clung
to
the
log
and
at
length
they
felt
its
great
length
give
a
little
shiver
beneath
them
presently
it
shifted
a
little
and
the
water
slipped
below
it
and
soon
it
swung
right
round
until
one
end
pointed
over
the
bank
still
the
flood
came
rising
and
rising
and
presently
a
wave
flowed
right
over
the
log
and
washed
off
some
of
the
people
who
were
clinging
to
it
but
the
man
and
the
three
women
dug
their
fingers
into
and
cracks
and
held
on
desperately
then
a
fresh
rush
of
water
took
the
log
and
it
bumped
heavily
three
times
on
the
bank
and
slid
off
into
the
water
at
first
its
weight
took
it
under
the
surface
and
the
four
blacks
feeling
the
cold
dark
water
close
over
their
heads
made
sure
that
death
had
come
for
them
still
they
gripped
the
log
and
presently
it
rose
and
the
current
whirled
it
round
and
sent
it
off
downstream
it
bumped
heavily
on
a
snag
and
one
of
the
women
fell
off
crying
for
help
as
she
went
the
man
leaned
over
quickly
and
by
good
chance
gripped
her
by
the
hair
somehow
half
pulled
half
climbing
she
managed
to
scramble
back
and
got
another
grip
upon
the
sodden
wood
then
the
flood
carried
them
into
the
darkness
all
through
the
cold
blackness
of
the
night
they
held
to
their
rocking
place
of
refuge
sometimes
it
went
aground
with
a
jar
that
shook
it
through
its
great
length
and
hung
awhile
before
a
fresh
spurt
of
water
washed
it
off
again
to
float
away
into
the
night
once
more
then
there
would
come
bends
in
the
river
when
the
current
would
fail
to
take
the
log
round
quickly
enough
because
it
was
so
long
and
it
would
sail
on
and
ram
its
nose
into
the
bank
running
so
far
into
the
soft
mud
that
perhaps
an
hour
would
creep
past
before
the
washing
of
the
water
worked
it
loose
again
then
the
log
would
swing
right
round
shaking
in
the
eddies
until
it
seemed
that
numbed
fingers
could
hold
no
longer
but
still
the
terrified
blacks
held
on
while
their
raft
spun
down
the
stream
once
more
with
the
cold
waves
splashing
over
their
shivering
bodies
dawn
broke
slowly
in
the
mist
of
driving
rain
and
showed
them
a
country
covered
as
far
as
they
could
see
with
water
on
either
side
of
the
river
the
topmost
ridge
of
the
high
banks
still
could
be
seen
but
soon
these
were
almost
submerged
and
the
log
floated
in
the
midst
of
a
great
brown
sea
about
two
hours
after
sunrise
a
sudden
swirl
of
water
took
the
log
and
floated
it
out
upon
the
top
of
the
bank
it
came
to
rest
with
a
shock
and
one
of
the
women
loosened
her
grip
and
fell
off
with
a
mournful
little
cry
that
she
could
hold
on
no
more
but
to
her
surprise
the
water
was
only
up
to
her
knees
and
the
log
lay
at
rest
beside
her
its
voyage
over
the
man
whose
name
was
karwin
grunted
as
he
straightened
his
stiffened
limbs
slipping
down
into
the
water
beside
the
woman
that
was
good
luck
for
you
murla
he
said
if
the
water
had
been
any
deeper
you
would
have
gone
for
ever
for
there
is
no
strength
left
in
me
to
pull
you
out
i
thought
it
was
the
end
said
murla
her
teeth
chattering
with
cold
and
as
far
as
i
can
see
it
might
as
well
have
been
the
end
for
it
is
better
to
die
quickly
than
slowly
and
we
shall
never
get
out
of
this
dreary
place
that
is
very
likely
said
karwin
but
still
i
am
glad
to
be
able
to
let
go
of
that
shaking
log
and
stand
upright
once
more
the
other
women
had
scrambled
to
a
sitting
position
on
the
log
and
were
rubbing
their
stiffened
limbs
i
think
those
who
stayed
in
camp
will
have
died
more
comfortably
than
we
shall
said
one
how
are
we
to
get
any
food
oh
there
will
be
no
food
karwin
answered
unless
the
flood
goes
down
very
quickly
we
shall
certainly
starve
i
do
not
even
know
where
we
are
and
i
have
no
weapons
ky
none
of
our
forefathers
ever
knew
such
a
flood
it
is
something
to
have
seen
it
illustration
there
will
be
no
food
karwin
answered
that
will
not
do
us
much
good
when
we
are
lying
dead
in
the
mud
said
murla
shortly
i
would
rather
have
a
piece
of
kangaroo
now
than
see
the
biggest
flood
that
ever
was
in
the
world
i
have
had
enough
of
floods
do
you
think
the
water
will
come
any
higher
how
can
i
tell
answered
karwin
shortly
then
because
they
were
all
tired
and
frozen
and
hungry
they
quarrelled
about
it
and
became
almost
warm
in
the
discussion
after
awhile
karwin
laughed
if
i
had
a
waddy
i
would
give
all
three
of
you
something
to
argue
over
he
said
what
is
the
use
of
becoming
angry
when
there
is
nothing
to
be
gained
by
it
it
will
not
take
us
off
this
bank
that
is
certain
no
but
it
keeps
us
from
thinking
murla
said
when
i
was
angry
just
now
i
quite
forgot
that
i
was
hungry
all
women
are
a
little
mad
said
karwin
scornfully
no
amount
of
talking
could
ever
make
me
forget
that
i
was
hungry
it
is
the
most
important
thing
in
the
world
he
looked
about
him
behind
the
ridge
of
the
river
bank
on
which
their
log
lay
the
current
of
the
flooded
stream
swept
by
deep
and
swift
before
the
sea
of
brown
water
stretched
as
far
as
he
could
see
broken
only
by
clusters
of
leaves
that
were
the
tops
of
submerged
trees
there
no
current
ran
but
the
wind
fled
along
the
surface
of
the
water
and
blew
it
into
ripples
and
little
waves
i
wonder
how
deep
that
is
said
karwin
thoughtfully
i
will
go
and
see
he
took
a
few
careful
steps
forward
then
his
foot
slipped
and
he
slid
off
the
mud
of
the
crest
of
the
bank
and
immediately
disappeared
with
a
loud
splash
the
women
set
up
a
dreadful
screaming
crying
come
back
which
under
the
circumstances
was
a
very
stupid
thing
to
say
for
a
long
moment
the
world
seemed
empty
before
them
then
karwin
head
suddenly
popped
up
out
of
the
water
with
his
face
very
wet
and
angry
he
swam
to
the
ridge
but
it
was
not
easy
to
get
upon
it
for
the
crest
was
sharp
and
very
slippery
as
karwin
already
knew
to
his
cost
several
times
he
clawed
at
it
only
to
slide
back
into
the
deep
water
spluttering
and
wrathful
hold
on
to
the
log
said
murla
quickly
to
one
of
the
women
then
give
your
sister
your
other
hand
and
she
can
hold
mine
the
three
formed
a
chain
and
found
that
by
stretching
as
far
as
they
could
reach
murla
could
just
touch
karwin
with
her
hand
he
made
a
great
effort
and
caught
it
in
a
firm
grip
and
then
they
pulled
all
together
and
so
managed
to
tug
him
over
the
edge
of
the
ridge
karwin
was
very
angry
and
not
at
all
grateful
to
them
you
might
have
thought
of
that
sooner
he
growled
ky
the
water
is
cold
and
i
sank
down
into
a
clump
of
prickly
bushes
so
that
i
am
stuck
with
prickles
all
over
there
is
no
getting
away
from
this
bank
that
is
certain
we
had
suspected
that
said
murla
laughing
at
this
karwin
became
than
ever
for
a
blackfellow
does
not
like
to
be
laughed
at
by
a
woman
any
more
than
a
white
man
likes
it
he
threatened
to
beat
them
all
and
even
struck
out
at
one
of
the
women
who
was
grinning
but
murla
spoke
to
him
severely
do
do
that
she
said
boldly
we
are
all
in
the
same
fix
together
and
we
will
not
be
beaten
by
you
if
you
strike
one
of
us
we
will
all
push
you
off
into
the
deep
water
and
this
time
we
will
not
pull
you
back
therefore
you
had
better
be
warned
murla
looked
so
fierce
as
she
spoke
that
karwin
stopped
the
hand
he
was
lifting
to
strike
the
woman
and
scratched
his
head
with
it
instead
it
was
quite
a
new
experience
for
a
blackfellow
to
be
ordered
about
by
a
lubra
and
you
can
fancy
that
he
did
not
like
it
still
the
other
women
were
clearly
prepared
to
back
up
murla
and
he
did
not
forget
how
he
had
struggled
in
the
water
at
the
edge
of
the
bank
before
they
pulled
him
in
so
instead
of
hitting
the
woman
he
growled
unpleasantly
and
waded
to
one
end
of
the
log
where
he
sat
down
and
gave
himself
up
to
very
bad
temper
this
time
however
he
kept
it
inside
him
and
so
it
did
not
hurt
anyone
the
sisters
looked
at
murla
with
great
respect
but
murla
only
laughed
at
them
she
was
a
pretty
woman
for
a
lubra
her
hair
was
long
and
very
black
and
curly
and
she
was
much
fairer
than
most
of
her
tribe
with
a
fine
flat
nose
and
a
merry
smile
none
of
her
teeth
had
been
knocked
out
which
happens
to
many
lubras
and
so
there
were
no
holes
in
her
smile
she
was
little
more
than
a
girl
but
she
was
tall
and
strong
and
very
clever
and
she
was
not
at
all
afraid
of
karwin
for
two
days
the
four
castaways
sat
on
their
log
and
watched
the
flood
once
it
rose
higher
when
a
fresh
mass
of
snow
was
washed
from
the
distant
and
came
down
to
swell
the
river
and
they
thought
their
log
was
again
about
to
be
carried
and
gave
themselves
up
for
lost
for
they
knew
that
now
they
were
too
weak
to
hold
on
for
very
long
but
the
log
held
firm
upon
the
bank
and
the
danger
passed
it
was
very
cold
they
plastered
themselves
all
over
with
a
thick
coating
of
mud
hoping
that
when
it
dried
it
would
keep
them
warmer
and
this
helped
them
against
the
cold
wind
though
it
was
not
at
all
comfortable
in
other
ways
but
worst
of
all
was
hunger
on
the
second
day
they
began
to
break
pieces
off
the
log
and
chew
them
and
that
as
you
can
imagine
did
very
little
good
karwin
became
more
and
more
and
looked
at
the
women
as
if
it
was
their
fault
also
he
was
very
sore
from
the
prickles
and
the
two
sisters
and
murla
spent
quite
a
long
time
in
picking
them
out
of
his
back
though
he
was
only
a
little
grateful
to
them
on
the
second
day
the
water
began
to
go
down
the
river
still
roared
and
raced
past
them
bearing
on
its
breast
all
kinds
of
things
trees
logs
bushes
interlaced
fragments
of
ruined
wurleys
drowned
animals
and
even
dead
blacks
but
its
water
slipped
back
from
the
bank
where
their
log
lay
until
it
left
them
on
a
little
mud
island
with
the
brown
sea
still
rippling
about
them
in
every
direction
the
tops
of
the
trees
came
farther
and
farther
out
of
the
water
and
new
came
into
view
with
their
boughs
laden
with
mud
often
they
saw
little
living
animals
in
the
brushwood
that
went
drifting
by
them
in
the
river
and
nearly
all
the
floating
rubbish
was
alive
with
snakes
that
had
taken
refuge
from
the
flood
sometimes
the
brushwood
would
break
up
in
the
current
and
they
would
see
the
snakes
swimming
wildly
until
the
river
carried
them
out
of
sight
two
came
ashore
on
their
island
and
karwin
killed
them
with
a
stick
he
had
taken
out
of
the
river
they
ate
them
and
felt
a
little
better
but
they
knew
that
they
must
soon
die
if
they
did
not
get
more
food
they
watched
the
river
anxiously
hoping
that
it
might
bring
them
something
else
towards
evening
they
were
gazing
when
murla
cried
out
suddenly
what
is
that
she
said
pointing
to
a
dark
spot
on
the
water
it
is
a
bush
said
one
of
the
women
in
a
dull
voice
no
i
am
certain
it
is
an
animal
murla
said
it
is
floating
towards
us
let
us
try
to
get
it
so
they
held
hands
as
they
had
done
when
karwin
fell
in
and
karwin
slipped
into
the
current
holding
murla
hand
tightly
he
had
found
a
stick
with
a
sharp
hook
on
one
end
where
a
branch
had
broken
off
and
when
the
dark
object
came
bobbing
he
thrust
at
it
fiercely
savage
with
hunger
the
hook
caught
in
it
and
very
carefully
they
drew
it
ashore
and
managed
to
get
it
on
their
island
it
was
a
harder
matter
to
get
karwin
back
but
they
managed
that
too
and
then
they
all
lay
on
the
mud
and
panted
and
except
for
murla
fair
face
they
looked
as
if
they
were
part
of
the
mud
their
find
was
a
plump
young
wombat
and
it
probably
saved
their
lives
of
course
they
had
no
way
of
cooking
it
but
at
the
moment
that
scarcely
troubled
them
neither
did
they
at
all
object
to
the
fact
that
it
had
been
dead
for
a
good
while
they
ate
it
all
and
long
after
the
moon
had
come
out
to
cast
her
white
light
into
the
flood
it
showed
them
sitting
on
the
log
happily
crunching
the
bones
chapter
ii
booran
was
a
very
clever
bird
he
was
bigger
than
most
of
the
and
very
strong
he
was
also
very
proud
partly
because
of
his
great
wings
which
would
carry
his
heavy
body
skimming
over
the
lakes
and
swamps
and
partly
because
of
his
beautiful
white
plumage
all
his
feathers
were
perfectly
white
and
he
was
so
vain
about
it
that
he
scorned
every
bird
that
had
coloured
or
dark
plumage
he
used
to
look
at
his
reflection
in
deep
pools
and
murmur
how
beautiful
i
am
if
by
any
mischance
he
got
a
on
his
feathers
he
was
quite
unhappy
until
he
had
managed
to
wash
it
off
some
people
might
not
think
a
pelican
a
very
lovely
bird
but
booran
was
completely
satisfied
with
himself
besides
being
beautiful
and
white
booran
at
that
time
owned
a
bark
canoe
it
made
him
prouder
than
ever
it
was
not
a
very
big
canoe
but
it
was
as
much
as
a
pelican
could
comfortably
manage
he
used
to
sit
in
it
and
paddle
it
along
with
his
strong
wings
there
was
really
no
reason
why
he
should
have
had
a
canoe
at
all
for
he
was
quite
able
to
swim
about
in
the
water
with
far
less
labour
than
it
needed
to
paddle
his
boat
with
his
wings
it
was
only
part
of
his
great
pride
still
no
other
bird
had
ever
thought
of
having
a
canoe
so
it
pleased
booran
to
think
himself
superior
to
them
all
no
other
bird
wanted
one
at
all
but
he
forgot
that
the
emu
laughed
at
him
openly
and
when
booran
offered
him
a
trip
in
his
canoe
he
asked
rudely
what
booran
thought
he
could
do
with
his
long
legs
in
such
a
cockle
shell
that
made
booran
more
indignant
than
he
had
ever
been
since
two
black
swans
had
risen
suddenly
under
the
canoe
one
day
and
upset
both
it
and
booran
in
a
very
muddy
part
of
a
lake
he
vowed
that
no
other
bird
should
ever
enter
it
sometimes
a
meek
little
bird
such
as
a
or
a
would
perch
on
the
edge
of
the
canoe
and
ask
to
be
ferried
about
but
booran
never
would
allow
it
he
used
to
catch
fish
and
when
he
had
stored
all
he
could
in
his
pouch
he
would
put
the
rest
in
the
canoe
so
that
soon
it
became
all
one
dreadful
smell
not
that
any
people
in
the
country
of
the
blacks
were
likely
to
object
to
that
they
were
brought
up
on
smells
when
the
big
flood
came
booran
enjoyed
himself
thoroughly
the
river
was
too
swift
for
him
to
attempt
in
his
canoe
at
first
but
he
paddled
about
in
the
water
that
covered
the
plains
and
poked
into
a
great
many
things
that
did
not
concern
him
in
the
least
sometimes
he
ran
aground
when
it
was
always
an
easy
matter
for
him
to
jump
overboard
and
push
the
canoe
off
with
his
great
beak
he
found
all
kinds
of
new
things
to
eat
floating
round
in
the
and
some
of
them
gave
him
indigestion
rather
badly
but
on
the
whole
it
was
a
very
interesting
time
and
he
was
very
glad
that
he
had
a
canoe
so
that
he
could
go
about
in
a
stylish
manner
it
was
on
the
afternoon
of
the
third
day
after
the
water
had
begun
to
go
down
that
booran
was
first
able
to
try
the
canoe
on
the
river
the
current
was
still
swift
but
he
kept
in
the
quieter
water
near
each
bank
and
did
not
find
much
difficulty
in
getting
about
he
saw
a
number
of
strange
blacks
on
a
rise
near
the
water
busily
building
wurleys
but
they
did
not
see
him
for
he
dodged
under
cover
of
the
fringing
the
bank
then
he
pulled
for
a
little
while
until
he
came
to
where
the
banks
were
lower
and
not
many
trees
were
to
be
seen
out
of
the
water
he
rounded
a
bend
and
came
upon
karwin
and
his
companions
booran
first
instinct
was
to
get
out
of
sight
he
was
afraid
of
all
blackfellows
especially
when
they
had
spears
and
but
before
he
could
go
the
woman
murla
saw
him
and
uttered
a
great
cry
of
astonishment
at
once
they
believed
that
it
was
magic
so
many
strange
things
could
be
explained
that
way
they
watched
the
big
white
bird
in
his
bark
canoe
and
waited
to
see
what
would
happen
hoping
that
he
was
not
an
evil
spirit
who
would
do
them
any
harm
seeing
them
so
quiet
and
realizing
that
they
were
unarmed
booran
allowed
his
natural
curiosity
to
get
the
better
of
him
he
paddled
across
the
river
swept
down
a
little
by
the
current
and
stopped
his
canoe
in
a
quiet
pool
near
the
mud
island
where
the
castaways
sat
miserably
on
their
log
they
looked
so
forlorn
and
unhappy
that
even
his
cold
and
fishy
heart
was
stirred
good
day
he
said
good
day
karwin
answered
this
is
a
big
flood
booran
remarked
yes
it
is
a
very
big
one
all
the
land
has
gone
away
yes
but
it
will
come
back
fish
are
scarce
now
that
the
river
is
high
that
is
very
likely
said
karwin
then
having
made
all
these
stupid
remarks
as
all
men
do
before
they
come
to
business
they
stopped
and
looked
at
the
sky
and
booran
said
i
wonder
if
more
rain
will
come
murla
struck
in
suddenly
men
are
very
strange
she
said
they
are
always
ready
to
jabber
how
is
it
that
you
go
about
in
that
little
boat
because
i
like
it
said
booran
shortly
for
he
did
not
approve
of
women
talking
so
freely
neither
did
he
like
the
question
about
his
canoe
murla
laughed
you
look
very
funny
when
you
are
cross
she
said
i
never
saw
such
a
dignified
pelican
the
other
women
shuddered
for
they
thought
that
booran
might
be
an
evil
spirit
in
which
case
he
would
certainly
object
to
such
remarks
but
booran
looked
at
murla
and
saw
how
pretty
she
was
and
suddenly
he
did
not
wish
to
be
angry
instead
he
smiled
at
her
and
no
one
who
has
not
seen
it
can
imagine
how
peculiar
a
pelican
looks
when
he
smiles
it
is
a
very
useful
canoe
he
said
i
have
been
all
over
the
in
it
and
have
seen
many
wonderful
things
have
you
any
food
asked
murla
eagerly
no
for
i
have
eaten
it
all
but
i
may
come
across
some
at
any
time
would
you
like
it
like
it
said
murla
why
we
have
only
had
two
snakes
and
a
wombat
between
us
for
four
days
and
the
wombat
was
only
a
little
one
i
could
eat
the
quills
of
a
porcupine
dear
me
said
booran
looking
at
her
with
his
foolish
little
eyes
very
wide
that
would
be
very
unpleasant
would
it
not
i
quite
regret
that
i
ate
an
old
fish
that
i
found
in
the
stern
of
my
canoe
this
morning
not
that
it
would
have
made
much
of
a
meal
for
four
people
it
would
have
given
me
a
breakfast
said
karwin
rudely
but
as
there
is
no
food
there
is
no
use
in
talking
about
it
tell
me
pelican
have
you
seen
any
of
our
people
we
do
not
know
if
there
are
any
left
alive
i
have
seen
some
blacks
but
i
do
not
know
if
they
are
your
people
booran
answered
they
are
across
the
river
where
they
are
building
themselves
new
huts
ca
you
go
and
see
if
they
belong
to
our
tribe
booran
shook
his
big
head
decidedly
not
i
he
said
most
blacks
are
very
uncivil
to
pelicans
and
these
had
weapons
close
at
hand
i
have
no
wish
to
be
found
with
a
spear
sticking
in
my
heart
or
in
any
other
part
of
me
did
you
notice
what
they
were
like
murla
asked
eagerly
i
saw
a
fat
woman
and
a
thin
man
said
booran
stupidly
how
should
i
know
what
they
were
like
they
are
not
beautiful
like
pelicans
oh
and
i
saw
a
very
tall
man
with
a
red
bone
through
his
nose
he
was
sitting
idly
on
a
stump
while
the
others
worked
that
was
my
husband
said
murla
with
a
faint
shriek
alas
i
thought
he
was
drowned
and
the
fat
woman
may
be
your
wife
goomah
she
said
to
karwin
very
likely
said
karwin
did
you
notice
if
they
had
food
i
do
not
know
but
it
is
likely
for
they
had
fire
and
there
was
a
pleasant
smell
if
my
wife
goomah
has
food
and
fire
while
i
have
nothing
there
will
be
trouble
said
karwin
wrathfully
that
may
be
but
we
will
die
here
without
ever
knowing
murla
said
long
before
the
water
goes
down
we
will
have
starved
to
death
and
then
nothing
will
matter
she
broke
off
a
bit
of
wood
and
flung
it
into
the
swirling
river
i
wish
we
had
never
tried
to
save
ourselves
or
seen
that
hateful
log
now
booran
had
been
watching
murla
and
he
thought
she
looked
very
capable
and
he
thought
that
she
could
be
very
useful
to
him
if
he
could
get
her
away
to
some
place
where
she
could
catch
fish
for
him
so
that
he
might
spend
all
his
time
admiring
himself
and
paddling
about
in
his
canoe
but
he
did
not
quite
know
how
to
manage
it
karwin
and
the
woman
went
on
wrangling
they
had
not
been
happy
before
booran
came
with
his
tidings
but
now
they
could
only
think
of
their
feasting
and
making
a
warm
and
comfortable
camp
and
it
made
them
feel
very
much
worse
than
they
had
felt
before
they
shouted
long
and
loudly
in
the
hope
of
making
the
others
hear
but
no
answer
came
and
the
river
rushed
by
them
without
pity
and
they
hated
their
little
mud
island
all
the
time
booran
gazed
at
murla
and
at
last
he
made
up
his
mind
that
he
could
not
possibly
do
without
her
whatever
happened
he
must
get
her
away
and
sail
with
her
in
his
bark
canoe
to
an
island
where
the
blacks
could
never
find
her
the
others
were
talking
so
fast
that
he
had
time
to
think
out
a
plan
and
when
they
stopped
for
lack
of
breath
he
spoke
i
think
if
you
sat
very
still
and
got
in
and
out
very
carefully
that
i
could
take
you
across
the
river
one
at
a
time
he
said
speaking
in
a
great
hurry
that
thing
would
sink
said
karwin
sulkily
looking
at
the
little
canoe
with
eyes
of
scorn
no
it
does
not
sink
easily
you
would
have
to
be
very
careful
but
it
would
be
safe
karwin
looked
at
the
canoe
and
then
he
looked
at
the
trees
that
showed
round
the
bend
when
the
high
banks
were
quite
clear
of
water
it
was
very
tempting
to
think
of
getting
there
such
a
little
way
he
thought
hard
then
he
said
you
can
take
kari
first
she
is
the
lightest
and
if
the
canoe
does
not
sink
with
her
perhaps
i
will
go
booran
did
not
care
which
he
took
first
so
long
as
it
was
not
murla
but
the
woman
kari
objected
very
strongly
and
made
a
great
outcry
for
she
thought
she
would
be
drowned
however
the
others
were
all
agreed
that
she
should
go
so
there
was
no
use
in
objecting
and
she
had
to
give
in
crying
and
trembling
she
stepped
into
the
canoe
which
booran
brought
close
to
the
bank
the
canoe
went
down
a
good
deal
but
it
did
not
sink
and
booran
paddled
gently
up
the
stream
keeping
very
close
to
the
bank
so
that
the
current
did
not
sweep
him
down
he
disappeared
round
the
bend
and
for
awhile
karwin
and
the
two
women
who
were
left
watched
anxiously
fearing
to
see
the
upturned
canoe
float
back
empty
but
in
about
ten
minutes
they
saw
booran
turn
the
corner
and
paddle
swiftly
down
evidently
very
pleased
with
himself
when
he
got
near
the
mud
island
he
called
out
all
is
well
i
landed
her
easily
on
the
bank
and
she
has
run
to
the
camp
that
made
the
others
eager
and
murla
stepped
forward
to
get
into
the
canoe
but
booran
stopped
her
saying
not
now
next
time
and
before
she
could
argue
karwin
twisted
her
out
of
his
way
and
stepped
into
the
canoe
so
hurriedly
that
it
nearly
sank
and
booran
called
out
very
angrily
to
him
to
mind
what
he
was
doing
however
the
canoe
righted
itself
and
presently
booran
had
paddled
it
out
of
sight
again
murla
began
to
feel
a
little
uneasy
though
she
scarcely
knew
why
there
was
something
wrong
about
the
way
that
booran
looked
at
her
with
his
cold
eyes
that
were
so
like
a
fish
she
felt
she
would
be
glad
when
she
was
out
of
his
canoe
and
safely
on
the
same
side
as
her
people
she
did
not
want
to
get
into
the
canoe
at
all
but
as
it
was
necessary
to
do
so
she
decided
to
get
it
over
as
soon
as
possible
so
she
said
to
the
other
black
woman
i
will
go
next
meri
all
right
said
meri
shivering
under
her
little
rug
and
her
coat
of
mud
but
tell
the
pelican
to
hurry
back
or
i
shall
certainly
die
of
cold
murla
waited
impatiently
until
booran
appeared
and
when
the
canoe
came
alongside
the
bank
she
was
ready
but
booran
looked
at
her
queerly
and
said
not
now
next
time
why
asked
murla
angrily
this
is
my
turn
not
now
next
time
was
all
booran
would
say
and
he
beckoned
to
meri
who
was
not
slow
to
obey
for
she
was
very
tired
of
waiting
she
stepped
in
and
the
canoe
moved
away
from
the
mud
island
suddenly
murla
was
very
much
afraid
although
as
a
rule
she
did
not
know
what
fear
meant
she
felt
that
she
must
not
get
into
canoe
that
there
was
danger
coming
very
close
to
her
in
a
few
minutes
he
would
be
back
for
her
a
quick
resolve
came
to
her
mind
whatever
happened
booran
must
not
find
her
there
when
he
came
back
she
slipped
off
her
rug
and
wrapped
it
round
a
log
that
had
come
ashore
on
their
island
it
was
just
as
long
as
she
was
and
when
the
rug
was
wrapped
about
it
it
looked
as
if
she
were
lying
asleep
then
she
slipped
into
the
river
and
began
to
swim
across
booran
and
meri
were
out
of
sight
round
the
bend
and
what
she
wanted
to
do
was
to
get
to
the
other
side
before
the
canoe
came
back
but
it
was
not
an
easy
matter
the
current
was
swift
and
though
she
was
a
very
strong
swimmer
it
took
her
and
once
she
thought
that
she
must
be
drowned
however
just
as
she
was
on
the
point
of
giving
up
she
felt
the
ground
under
her
feet
and
scrambled
out
upon
a
bank
that
was
nearly
all
under
water
then
she
waded
along
it
until
she
got
near
the
bend
just
then
she
heard
the
noise
of
booran
wings
brushing
in
the
water
she
flung
herself
down
on
her
face
just
in
time
for
the
canoe
came
round
the
bend
and
passed
quite
close
to
her
booran
heard
the
swirl
in
the
water
and
glanced
round
seeing
the
ripples
but
just
then
he
caught
sight
of
what
looked
like
murla
lying
on
the
mud
island
and
he
said
oh
it
was
only
a
water
rat
and
paddled
on
murla
lay
still
in
the
water
holding
her
breath
until
he
had
floated
down
the
stream
then
she
got
up
very
quietly
and
waded
sinking
in
the
soft
mud
of
the
bank
until
it
grew
higher
and
trees
and
dry
land
could
be
seen
she
ran
then
casting
her
eyes
wildly
about
until
she
saw
ahead
a
little
drift
of
smoke
and
presently
toiling
up
a
steep
rise
in
the
bank
she
came
upon
the
blacks
where
already
karwin
and
meri
and
kari
were
jabbering
loudly
telling
all
their
experiences
and
hearing
those
of
the
others
at
the
same
time
they
cried
out
with
astonishment
when
they
saw
murla
coming
along
the
bank
and
asked
her
why
booran
had
not
brought
her
in
his
canoe
when
she
told
them
she
had
been
afraid
of
him
they
all
laughed
at
her
but
her
husband
the
tall
man
with
the
red
bone
through
his
nose
was
very
angry
because
she
had
left
her
rug
behind
and
asked
her
if
she
thought
rugs
like
that
grew
on
wild
he
went
off
at
once
to
see
if
he
could
get
it
back
telling
her
as
he
went
that
if
he
failed
she
need
not
think
she
was
going
to
have
his
of
course
murla
had
known
that
already
meanwhile
booran
had
paddled
down
to
the
mud
island
and
seeing
the
form
in
the
rug
lying
under
the
shelter
of
the
great
log
he
called
to
it
several
times
saying
come
on
now
it
is
your
turn
but
no
movement
came
and
at
last
he
grew
angry
and
hopped
out
of
the
canoe
and
went
on
to
the
island
still
calling
there
was
no
answer
and
he
lost
his
temper
and
kicked
the
figure
very
hard
with
the
result
that
he
hurt
his
foot
very
much
then
he
pulled
the
rug
off
roughly
and
found
only
a
log
underneath
booran
became
furious
he
had
been
made
to
look
a
fool
for
awhile
he
stamped
about
the
island
screaming
in
his
rage
and
when
the
blacks
got
to
the
opposite
bank
that
is
how
they
saw
him
then
booran
made
up
his
mind
that
he
would
look
out
fight
as
the
blacks
do
and
kill
the
husband
of
the
woman
so
he
took
some
mud
and
smeared
it
on
himself
in
long
lines
so
that
he
might
be
striped
as
the
blacks
are
when
they
go
fighting
for
a
blackfellow
does
not
consider
himself
dressed
for
battle
until
he
has
painted
himself
in
long
white
streaks
with
pipeclay
he
was
so
busy
painting
and
planning
how
he
would
slay
murla
husband
that
he
did
not
see
a
black
shadow
in
the
sky
it
was
another
pelican
and
he
came
nearer
puzzled
to
know
what
could
be
this
strange
thing
so
like
a
pelican
and
yet
striped
like
a
fighting
man
he
could
not
make
it
out
but
he
decided
it
could
not
be
right
and
so
he
drove
at
booran
and
struck
him
in
the
throat
with
his
great
beak
killing
him
then
he
flew
away
now
the
blacks
say
there
are
no
black
pelicans
any
more
they
are
all
black
and
white
just
as
booran
was
when
his
death
came
to
him
suddenly
out
of
the
sky
the
blacks
across
the
river
were
very
much
amazed
but
when
the
great
black
pelican
had
sailed
away
murla
husband
swam
across
and
got
her
rug
which
he
brought
back
tied
on
top
of
his
head
he
gave
it
back
to
murla
and
then
beat
her
with
his
waddy
for
having
been
so
careless
as
to
leave
it
behind
so
they
lived
happily
ever
after
but
the
river
took
booran
little
canoe
and
whisked
it
away
it
bobbed
upon
the
brown
water
like
a
walnut
shell
spinning
in
the
eddies
and
sailing
proudly
where
the
water
was
clear
and
free
at
each
mile
the
river
grew
wider
and
fuller
and
the
little
canoe
sped
onwards
on
its
breast
then
ahead
came
a
long
line
of
gleaming
silver
and
the
river
sang
that
it
had
nearly
reached
the
sea
the
light
canoe
rocked
over
the
waters
of
the
bar
but
came
safely
through
them
and
then
it
floated
away
westward
into
the
sunset
but
the
tide
brought
it
back
to
shore
and
the
breakers
took
it
and
flung
it
on
the
rocks
pounding
it
on
their
sharp
edges
until
it
was
no
longer
a
canoe
but
only
a
twisted
bit
of
bark
the
waves
went
back
and
left
it
lying
on
the
beach
and
some
blacks
who
came
along
hungry
and
cold
were
very
glad
to
find
it
and
use
it
to
start
their
fire
when
it
was
dry
so
booran
canoe
was
useful
to
the
blacks
until
the
very
end
v
the
story
of
the
stars
who
was
maker
of
men
sat
in
his
high
place
one
day
and
looked
at
the
world
the
blacks
believed
that
in
the
very
long
ago
he
had
made
the
first
men
and
women
out
of
clay
and
from
there
they
had
spread
over
all
the
earth
had
made
them
to
be
good
and
happy
and
for
a
long
while
he
had
been
satisfied
with
them
but
now
it
was
different
and
he
was
angry
all
over
the
world
he
could
see
his
black
people
they
had
grown
tall
and
strong
and
he
thought
them
beautiful
they
were
skilled
in
hunting
and
fierce
in
battle
the
women
were
clever
at
making
rugs
of
skins
at
cooking
at
weaving
curious
mats
and
baskets
of
pliant
rushes
the
forests
were
full
of
game
for
them
beasts
and
reptiles
all
good
to
eat
there
were
fish
in
the
lakes
and
rivers
fat
in
the
creeks
and
swamps
and
gum
and
manna
to
be
found
on
every
the
world
was
a
good
green
world
and
there
should
have
been
only
happiness
but
the
people
themselves
had
grown
wicked
bent
his
brows
with
anger
as
he
looked
down
upon
them
instead
of
being
peaceful
and
content
his
people
had
grown
fierce
and
savage
they
thought
only
of
fighting
and
conquest
and
were
too
lazy
to
work
the
laws
that
he
had
made
for
them
were
as
naught
in
their
eyes
they
said
oh
is
very
far
away
he
will
never
come
down
into
our
world
to
see
what
we
do
why
should
we
obey
him
so
they
did
just
as
they
pleased
and
all
the
world
was
evil
because
of
their
wickedness
thought
gravely
as
he
looked
down
into
his
world
and
all
the
sky
was
dark
with
the
blackness
of
his
frown
my
people
have
grown
too
many
he
said
when
they
were
few
each
helped
the
other
there
was
no
time
for
feuds
or
fighting
for
all
had
to
work
together
in
order
to
live
now
all
is
changed
they
are
many
and
powerful
and
they
the
world
and
each
man
hates
his
brother
it
were
better
if
i
made
them
fewer
and
scattered
them
far
and
wide
i
will
send
my
whirlwinds
upon
the
earth
so
caused
storms
and
fierce
winds
to
arise
often
and
they
swept
across
the
world
in
the
flat
lands
there
came
suddenly
whirlwinds
of
great
force
that
twisted
and
eddied
through
the
plains
carrying
men
aloft
in
their
choking
embrace
and
letting
them
fall
broken
and
dead
miles
away
from
the
places
where
they
had
lived
on
the
mountains
great
hurricanes
blew
shrieking
from
peak
to
peak
tearing
up
the
largest
trees
by
their
roots
and
tossing
them
down
into
the
gullies
far
below
huge
boulders
were
loosened
and
went
crashing
down
and
often
a
landslip
followed
them
when
all
the
soil
would
be
stripped
from
a
and
fall
thundering
carrying
with
it
hundreds
of
people
and
leaving
the
bare
rock
behind
it
like
a
scar
upon
the
side
of
the
mountain
thunder
and
lightning
came
and
shook
the
world
with
terror
mighty
trees
were
riven
and
shattered
and
fires
swept
through
forest
and
plain
leaving
blackness
and
desolation
behind
then
came
floods
that
covered
the
parts
of
the
earth
and
made
of
the
rivers
roaring
torrents
that
ran
madly
to
the
sea
the
world
trembled
in
the
terror
of
the
wrath
of
and
yet
men
had
grown
so
wise
and
cunning
that
not
very
many
died
when
the
whirlwinds
and
hurricanes
came
they
crept
into
holes
in
the
or
sheltered
themselves
in
deep
gullies
they
strengthened
their
houses
so
that
the
wind
should
not
blow
them
away
sometimes
they
floated
down
the
rivers
in
bark
canoes
and
a
great
number
found
refuge
in
caves
those
who
were
killed
were
the
careless
ones
who
would
not
take
the
trouble
to
protect
themselves
against
the
fury
of
the
storms
thinking
that
they
would
only
be
ordinary
gales
but
though
they
died
innumerable
people
were
left
just
for
a
little
while
they
were
afraid
they
knew
they
were
wicked
and
that
must
be
angry
with
them
and
the
thought
that
possibly
the
storms
were
the
message
of
his
wrath
made
them
careful
for
awhile
but
as
time
passed
they
forgot
the
storms
and
whirlwinds
and
the
fate
of
their
brothers
and
sisters
who
had
been
killed
and
they
went
back
to
their
wickedness
becoming
worse
than
they
had
been
before
and
then
there
came
a
day
when
anger
broke
anew
one
morning
a
blackness
came
out
of
the
sky
and
in
the
blackness
a
flame
of
gleaming
fire
the
people
clustered
together
in
terror
and
there
were
cries
of
is
coming
then
the
began
to
chatter
and
make
magic
hoping
to
turn
the
wrath
of
the
maker
of
men
and
the
people
flung
themselves
upon
the
ground
crying
aloud
and
calling
upon
the
good
spirits
to
save
them
the
blackness
swooped
down
upon
the
earth
in
the
air
were
strange
whisperings
and
mutterings
as
if
even
the
rustling
leaves
and
the
boughs
of
the
trees
were
crying
is
coming
and
then
out
of
the
glowing
heart
of
the
cloud
came
himself
that
he
might
see
these
men
and
women
that
he
had
made
he
spoke
no
word
his
glance
was
like
lightnings
playing
about
the
stricken
eyes
of
those
that
gazed
but
he
trod
among
the
black
multitudes
and
the
noise
of
the
trampling
of
his
feet
shook
the
earth
in
his
hand
he
carried
his
great
stone
knife
and
the
sight
of
it
was
very
terrible
those
who
looked
upon
it
fell
back
blindly
but
as
he
walked
on
he
cut
his
way
among
the
people
with
great
sweeps
of
the
cruel
weapon
sparing
none
that
came
in
his
way
and
cutting
them
into
small
fragments
and
then
the
blackness
of
the
cloud
received
him
again
and
hid
him
from
the
people
of
the
world
but
the
pieces
of
the
slain
were
not
dead
each
fragment
moved
as
the
worm
moves
and
from
them
rose
a
cry
it
came
from
the
fragments
of
those
who
had
been
good
men
and
good
women
yet
who
had
met
death
at
the
knife
of
with
the
guilty
ones
then
a
great
and
terrible
storm
came
out
of
the
sky
sweeping
over
the
places
where
had
trod
and
with
it
a
whirlwind
that
gathered
up
the
pieces
of
those
who
had
been
men
women
and
children
and
they
became
like
flakes
of
snow
white
and
whirling
in
the
blackness
of
the
air
they
were
carried
away
into
the
clouds
and
when
they
came
to
where
sat
once
more
looking
down
upon
the
world
he
took
the
flakes
that
had
been
bad
men
and
women
and
with
his
hand
scattered
them
so
far
over
the
earth
that
no
man
could
say
where
they
fell
so
they
passed
for
ever
from
the
sight
of
man
and
now
they
lie
in
the
waste
places
of
the
world
where
there
is
neither
light
nor
day
but
took
the
snowflakes
that
had
been
good
men
and
women
and
he
made
them
into
stars
right
up
into
the
blue
sky
he
flung
them
and
the
sky
caught
them
and
held
them
fast
and
the
light
of
the
sun
fell
upon
them
so
that
they
caught
some
of
his
brightness
there
they
stay
for
ever
and
you
would
not
know
that
they
are
in
any
way
different
from
the
other
stars
that
twinkle
at
you
on
a
frosty
night
when
the
sky
is
all
blue
and
silver
only
the
who
know
everything
can
tell
you
which
among
the
stars
were
once
good
men
women
and
children
before
left
his
high
seat
to
punish
the
wickedness
of
the
world
vi
how
light
came
the
blacks
believed
that
the
earth
was
quite
flat
with
the
sky
arched
above
it
they
had
an
idea
that
if
anyone
could
get
beyond
the
edge
of
the
sky
he
would
come
to
another
country
with
rivers
and
trees
where
live
the
ghosts
of
all
the
people
who
have
died
some
thought
that
there
was
water
all
round
the
edge
of
the
earth
they
were
taught
that
at
first
the
sky
had
lain
flat
on
the
ground
so
that
neither
sun
moon
nor
stars
could
move
but
the
magpies
came
along
and
propped
it
up
with
long
sticks
resting
some
parts
on
the
mountains
near
the
edge
and
sometimes
word
was
sent
from
tribe
to
tribe
saying
that
the
props
were
growing
rotten
and
unless
the
people
sent
up
tomahawks
to
cut
new
props
the
sky
would
fall
in
its
falling
it
would
burst
and
all
the
people
would
be
drowned
this
used
to
alarm
the
blacks
greatly
and
they
would
make
the
weave
charms
so
that
the
sky
should
not
fall
at
first
all
the
earth
was
in
darkness
and
at
that
time
there
lived
among
the
blacks
a
man
called
dityi
in
his
tribe
was
a
very
beautiful
woman
whose
name
was
mitjen
and
she
became
dityi
wife
at
first
dityi
and
mitjen
were
very
happy
they
had
plenty
to
eat
and
the
camp
was
warm
and
comfortable
and
they
loved
each
other
very
much
there
were
no
white
men
at
that
time
the
blacks
ruled
all
their
country
which
they
thought
was
the
whole
world
the
forests
were
full
of
game
and
the
rivers
of
fish
every
one
had
enough
so
there
was
no
fighting
and
dityi
thought
he
was
the
luckiest
man
in
the
world
because
he
had
won
the
love
of
mitjen
but
a
stranger
came
to
the
camp
a
tall
man
named
bunjil
he
told
stories
of
forests
and
wonderful
things
to
be
found
there
the
other
blacks
used
to
listen
to
him
greatly
interested
and
no
one
listened
more
attentively
than
mitjen
for
she
had
a
great
longing
to
see
the
wonderful
places
of
which
bunjil
spoke
when
she
heard
him
tell
stories
of
these
strange
lands
of
the
bush
she
burned
to
leave
her
quiet
home
and
go
exploring
dityi
could
not
understand
this
feeling
at
all
it
interested
him
to
hear
bunjil
tales
but
he
had
no
wish
to
do
more
than
hear
them
he
was
very
well
satisfied
with
his
life
and
thought
that
his
own
home
was
better
than
any
other
place
could
possibly
be
but
bunjil
soon
noticed
the
girl
who
never
lost
a
word
of
his
stories
it
amused
him
to
see
her
face
light
up
and
her
eyes
sparkle
at
his
talk
and
so
he
told
more
and
more
stories
and
did
not
always
trouble
to
make
them
true
so
long
as
he
could
make
mitjen
look
interested
sometimes
he
would
meet
her
wandering
alone
outside
the
camp
and
then
he
would
tell
her
as
if
he
were
sorry
for
her
that
this
quiet
camp
was
no
place
for
her
at
all
you
are
so
beautiful
he
would
say
that
you
should
be
far
away
in
my
wonderful
country
where
you
would
see
many
great
men
and
lovely
women
but
none
more
lovely
than
mitjen
in
this
dull
hole
you
are
buried
alive
none
of
this
was
true
but
bunjil
spoke
exactly
as
if
it
were
and
after
a
time
mitjen
began
to
be
very
discontented
the
simple
happy
life
in
the
bush
pleased
her
no
longer
she
only
wanted
the
exciting
things
of
which
bunjil
told
at
home
everybody
was
good
to
her
and
liked
her
but
she
was
only
a
girl
who
had
to
obey
other
people
all
the
time
and
no
one
but
dityi
had
ever
troubled
about
telling
her
that
she
was
beautiful
moreover
she
could
see
that
bunjil
did
not
think
much
of
dityi
he
called
him
one
day
to
mitjen
an
ignorant
black
fellow
and
though
mitjen
could
not
imagine
any
people
who
were
not
black
it
sounded
very
uncomplimentary
and
she
could
not
forget
it
as
soon
as
he
had
said
it
bunjil
apologized
saying
that
it
was
only
a
slip
of
the
tongue
but
in
her
heart
mitjen
knew
this
was
not
true
it
made
her
look
down
on
dityi
a
little
and
wonder
if
he
were
really
worthy
of
her
one
day
she
asked
him
if
he
would
take
her
to
bunjil
country
and
his
surprise
prevented
him
from
speaking
for
some
time
he
could
only
look
at
her
with
his
mouth
open
go
away
from
home
he
said
at
last
why
what
is
there
to
go
for
to
see
the
world
said
mitjen
tossing
her
head
i
do
not
want
to
stay
for
ever
in
this
weary
place
but
it
is
the
world
or
most
of
it
returned
dityi
i
do
not
know
where
bunjil
country
is
but
the
men
there
can
not
be
up
to
much
if
they
are
like
him
for
he
is
more
useless
than
anyone
i
ever
saw
he
can
not
throw
a
boomerang
better
than
a
girl
and
with
a
spear
i
could
beat
him
with
my
left
hand
you
are
boastful
said
mitjen
coldly
throwing
weapons
is
not
everything
well
i
do
know
how
things
are
managed
in
bunjil
country
but
it
is
very
important
in
ours
that
a
man
should
know
how
to
throw
said
dityi
perhaps
bunjil
game
comes
close
to
him
to
be
killed
but
here
a
man
has
to
hunt
it
did
bunjil
mention
if
it
came
ready
cooked
too
i
do
suppose
you
would
want
to
do
any
work
in
that
country
of
his
this
made
mitjen
very
angry
and
she
quarrelled
fiercely
with
dityi
for
making
fun
of
her
and
then
dityi
lost
his
temper
and
beat
her
a
little
which
was
quite
a
usual
thing
to
happen
to
a
woman
among
the
blacks
but
mitjen
had
been
told
by
bunjil
that
in
his
country
a
man
never
raised
his
hand
against
a
woman
so
it
made
her
furious
to
be
beaten
by
dityi
though
he
cared
for
her
too
much
really
to
hurt
her
and
she
broke
away
from
him
and
ran
to
the
camp
sobbing
that
she
hated
him
and
did
not
want
to
see
him
any
more
near
the
camp
she
met
bunjil
who
asked
her
why
she
was
crying
and
when
she
told
him
he
was
kind
to
her
patting
her
gently
and
pretending
to
be
very
angry
with
dityi
he
was
safe
in
doing
this
for
dityi
had
gone
off
whistling
into
the
bush
not
sorry
that
he
had
beaten
mitjen
if
it
should
make
her
sensible
again
but
sorry
that
she
was
unhappy
and
resolved
to
bring
her
back
a
snake
or
something
equally
nice
for
supper
so
bunjil
ran
no
risk
in
abusing
him
and
he
did
it
heartily
when
they
had
finished
talking
mitjen
walked
away
from
him
into
the
camp
with
a
very
determined
face
she
went
straight
to
her
wurley
and
though
dityi
brought
her
home
a
beautiful
young
snake
and
a
she
would
eat
nothing
and
refused
to
come
out
of
the
wurley
to
speak
to
him
so
dityi
went
back
to
the
young
huts
angry
and
offended
and
mitjen
lay
down
turning
her
face
to
the
wall
she
was
just
as
determined
but
only
her
own
heart
knew
how
much
she
was
afraid
when
the
people
of
the
camp
awoke
she
was
gone
nowhere
was
there
any
trace
of
her
and
when
the
blacks
went
to
look
for
bunjil
in
his
wurley
he
was
gone
too
then
they
fell
into
a
great
rage
and
the
young
men
painted
themselves
in
white
stripes
with
pipeclay
and
went
forth
in
pursuit
carrying
all
their
arms
and
led
by
dityi
but
though
they
looked
for
many
days
they
could
never
come
upon
a
track
and
so
at
last
the
other
young
men
gave
up
the
search
and
went
back
to
the
camp
but
dityi
did
not
go
back
there
was
nothing
for
him
at
home
now
that
he
had
lost
mitjen
and
so
he
went
on
hunting
through
the
dark
forests
for
his
lost
love
bunjil
and
mitjen
had
fled
far
into
the
bush
for
a
long
time
they
walked
in
the
creek
so
that
they
would
leave
no
tracks
and
if
they
came
to
deep
holes
they
swam
them
they
were
far
away
from
country
before
they
dared
to
leave
the
water
and
already
the
girl
was
tired
but
bunjil
would
not
let
her
stop
to
rest
for
he
knew
that
they
would
be
pursued
he
hurried
her
on
forgetting
now
to
be
gentle
when
he
spoke
to
her
it
was
not
many
days
before
mitjen
realized
the
terrible
mistake
she
had
made
they
fled
deeper
and
deeper
into
the
bush
but
no
wonderful
country
came
in
sight
she
was
often
cold
and
hungry
and
bunjil
made
her
work
harder
than
she
had
ever
worked
before
doing
not
only
the
woman
work
but
a
large
share
of
the
man
she
found
out
that
he
was
almost
too
lazy
to
get
food
and
if
she
had
not
hunted
for
game
herself
she
would
never
have
had
enough
to
eat
bunjil
had
told
her
that
he
loved
her
but
very
soon
she
knew
that
this
was
not
true
and
that
all
he
had
wanted
was
a
woman
to
cook
for
him
and
help
him
procure
food
at
first
she
used
to
ask
him
when
they
would
come
to
his
own
country
and
he
would
put
her
off
saying
presently
pretty
soon
but
before
long
she
found
that
it
made
him
angry
to
be
asked
about
it
and
at
last
if
she
spoke
of
it
he
beat
her
cruelly
so
mitjen
did
not
ask
any
more
then
all
the
memories
of
dityi
and
his
love
came
crowding
upon
her
and
her
heart
quite
broke
she
did
not
want
to
live
any
more
she
lay
down
under
a
big
log
and
when
bunjil
spoke
to
her
there
was
no
answer
so
he
kicked
her
and
left
her
but
after
he
had
slept
he
went
to
see
why
she
lay
so
still
and
he
found
that
she
was
dead
as
he
looked
at
her
a
great
storm
came
out
of
the
bush
and
whirled
him
away
it
flung
him
far
up
in
the
sky
where
you
may
see
him
now
if
you
look
closely
a
lonely
wandering
star
finding
no
rest
anywhere
and
no
mate
always
he
must
wander
on
and
on
and
never
stop
no
matter
how
tired
he
may
be
and
the
other
stars
shrink
from
him
hurrying
away
if
they
cross
his
path
the
storm
took
mitjen
also
and
carried
her
gently
into
the
sky
and
there
she
saw
dityi
who
lit
it
all
up
for
he
had
been
turned
into
the
sun
and
was
giving
light
to
the
earth
but
always
the
blacks
say
he
is
seeking
mitjen
like
a
great
fire
he
leaps
through
the
sky
mourning
for
his
love
and
going
back
and
forth
in
ceaseless
quest
of
her
his
wurley
is
in
nganat
just
over
the
edge
of
the
earth
and
the
bright
colour
of
sunset
is
caused
by
the
spirits
of
the
dead
going
in
and
out
of
nganat
while
dityi
looks
among
them
for
his
lost
love
but
he
never
finds
her
and
so
next
day
he
begins
to
hunt
again
and
goes
tramping
across
the
sky
sometimes
he
shouts
her
name
mitjen
mitjen
and
it
is
then
that
we
hear
thunder
go
rolling
round
the
world
but
mitjen
never
answers
she
has
been
made
the
moon
and
always
she
mourns
far
away
and
alone
when
she
sees
the
glory
of
the
sun
and
hears
his
trampling
feet
she
hides
herself
for
now
she
is
ashamed
to
let
him
find
her
she
only
comes
from
her
when
he
sleeps
and
then
she
hurries
through
the
sky
so
that
she
may
have
the
comfort
of
going
in
his
footsteps
though
she
knows
now
that
she
can
never
hope
to
overtake
him
sometimes
she
sighs
and
then
a
soft
breeze
flutters
over
the
earth
and
the
big
rain
is
the
tears
that
relieve
her
grief
vii
the
frog
that
laughed
before
maker
of
men
peopled
the
earth
with
the
black
tribes
and
very
long
before
the
first
white
man
came
to
australia
the
animals
which
inhabited
the
land
fell
into
a
great
trouble
and
this
is
how
it
happened
old
conara
the
black
chief
told
it
to
me
while
we
were
fishing
for
cod
in
the
murray
one
hot
night
and
he
had
it
from
his
father
whose
mother
had
told
him
about
it
while
to
her
the
story
had
come
from
her
grandfather
who
said
he
was
a
little
boy
when
his
grandfather
had
told
him
saying
he
had
had
the
story
from
conara
the
magpie
after
whom
he
was
named
and
the
magpies
learn
everything
so
you
see
he
ought
to
know
conara
said
that
once
in
the
time
all
the
animals
were
living
very
cheerfully
together
when
suddenly
all
the
water
disappeared
they
went
to
sleep
with
the
creeks
and
swamps
full
and
the
rivers
running
and
when
they
woke
up
everything
was
dry
of
course
this
was
the
most
terrible
thing
that
could
happen
to
the
animals
for
though
they
can
manage
with
very
little
food
in
australia
at
a
pinch
they
must
always
have
plenty
of
water
they
searched
everywhere
for
it
through
the
scrub
and
over
the
plains
and
the
birds
flew
great
distances
always
seeking
with
their
eyes
for
a
gleam
of
water
but
it
had
quite
gone
so
the
animals
held
a
council
of
war
and
mirran
the
kangaroo
spoke
to
them
at
a
council
some
one
must
always
speak
first
to
tell
those
present
what
they
know
already
and
mirran
did
this
very
thoroughly
so
that
little
the
native
bear
went
to
sleep
and
began
to
climb
up
the
legs
of
the
emu
in
his
sleep
thinking
she
was
a
tree
this
led
to
a
disturbance
and
it
was
some
time
before
mirran
could
go
on
again
with
his
speech
then
he
found
he
had
forgotten
the
rest
of
what
he
meant
to
say
so
he
contented
himself
by
asking
them
all
what
they
meant
to
do
about
it
and
remarking
that
the
matter
was
now
open
for
discussion
this
is
a
remark
often
made
at
meetings
then
mirran
sat
down
thankfully
but
in
his
relief
at
finishing
his
speech
he
sat
on
kowern
the
porcupine
and
kowern
is
the
most
uncomfortable
seat
in
the
bush
mirran
got
up
more
quickly
than
he
had
sat
down
and
again
there
was
disorder
in
the
meeting
especially
as
the
jackass
was
unfeeling
enough
to
laugh
when
matters
were
more
quiet
kellelek
the
cockatoo
made
a
long
speech
but
it
was
hard
to
understand
what
he
said
because
all
his
brothers
would
persist
in
speaking
at
the
same
time
every
one
knew
that
he
wanted
water
but
as
every
one
was
in
the
same
fix
it
did
not
seem
to
help
along
matters
to
have
him
say
so
booran
the
pelican
was
even
more
troubled
about
it
than
kellelek
for
of
course
he
lived
on
the
water
and
he
wanted
fish
badly
all
the
fish
had
disappeared
and
the
eels
had
buried
themselves
deep
in
the
soft
mud
of
the
beds
of
the
rivers
and
creeks
and
none
of
the
had
any
food
the
red
wallaby
waat
and
old
warreen
the
wombat
made
speeches
and
so
did
meri
the
black
dingo
and
tonga
the
and
a
great
many
other
animals
but
not
one
could
suggest
any
means
of
getting
water
back
or
form
an
idea
as
to
how
it
had
gone
away
they
were
all
talking
together
getting
rather
hot
and
excited
and
very
thirsty
when
they
heard
a
sudden
whirr
of
wings
overhead
and
a
bird
came
dropping
down
into
their
midst
it
was
tarook
the
sea
gull
and
though
at
first
they
were
inclined
to
be
angry
at
his
sudden
appearance
they
soon
saw
that
he
had
news
to
communicate
and
so
they
crowded
round
him
and
begged
him
to
speak
tarook
was
a
proud
bird
and
did
not
often
leave
his
beloved
sea
so
they
knew
that
something
important
must
have
brought
him
so
far
inshore
he
stood
in
their
midst
dainty
and
handsome
with
his
snowy
feathers
and
scarlet
legs
and
carefully
brushed
a
fragment
of
grass
from
his
wing
before
replying
waga
the
came
along
this
morning
in
a
shocking
temper
too
and
told
me
of
your
difficulties
he
said
well
we
of
the
sea
know
what
has
caused
them
there
was
an
instant
hubbub
all
the
animals
and
birds
cried
out
at
once
saying
what
is
it
tarook
looked
at
them
all
calmly
if
you
make
such
a
clatter
how
can
i
tell
you
he
asked
crossly
i
have
not
much
time
either
because
my
mate
and
i
have
youngsters
to
look
after
and
it
is
nearly
time
i
got
back
to
find
their
dinner
the
animals
became
silent
at
once
and
looked
at
him
anxiously
three
nights
ago
said
tarook
the
big
frog
came
out
of
the
sea
every
one
knows
he
lives
there
but
none
of
us
had
ever
seen
him
and
he
is
as
large
as
many
wurleys
all
the
sea
was
troubled
at
his
coming
and
big
waves
rolled
in
and
beat
upon
the
shore
so
that
we
could
scarcely
see
the
rocks
for
spray
a
hollow
booming
sound
came
from
under
the
sea
and
all
our
young
ones
were
very
much
alarmed
then
a
wave
larger
than
all
the
rest
put
together
crashed
into
the
beach
and
when
it
began
to
roll
back
we
saw
waddling
up
the
shore
most
frogs
hop
but
he
is
so
huge
that
he
gets
along
in
a
kind
of
shuffle
but
where
did
he
go
cried
kadin
the
he
waddled
away
into
the
plains
beyond
and
when
i
flew
in
to
look
for
him
for
awhile
i
could
not
find
him
then
i
heard
a
strange
noise
of
water
sucking
and
i
flew
to
where
it
came
from
there
was
a
hollow
in
the
creek
bank
and
was
sitting
there
with
his
head
in
the
water
sucking
it
all
up
and
as
he
sucked
he
swelled
it
was
not
a
nice
sight
and
soon
i
flew
away
but
where
is
he
now
and
what
did
he
do
asked
the
animals
anxiously
i
did
not
watch
him
any
more
but
the
west
wind
knows
all
about
him
and
he
told
me
when
i
was
out
fishing
last
night
it
seems
that
lives
under
the
sea
because
of
his
former
sins
and
that
is
why
he
has
grown
so
huge
but
he
always
wants
to
come
back
to
land
and
sometimes
he
breaks
away
from
his
prison
under
the
sea
and
gets
up
to
the
surface
and
a
great
stir
his
coming
makes
it
very
annoying
if
you
fishing
for
it
scares
all
the
fish
away
into
the
farthest
corners
of
the
rocks
but
the
salt
water
he
has
drunk
for
so
long
makes
him
terribly
thirsty
and
unless
he
can
get
fresh
water
to
drink
he
has
to
go
back
to
his
then
that
is
why
he
has
drunk
all
of
ours
cried
the
animals
tarook
nodded
very
hard
yes
he
said
it
is
very
seldom
that
he
gets
a
chance
of
coming
up
and
his
last
three
landings
have
been
made
in
the
desert
where
he
has
had
no
water
at
all
and
has
been
forced
to
hurry
back
meekly
to
the
sea
so
he
is
now
more
thirsty
than
he
ever
was
before
the
west
wind
says
he
did
not
stop
drinking
until
this
morning
and
now
there
is
no
water
anywhere
as
you
know
then
how
shall
we
ever
get
any
more
are
we
to
die
of
thirst
well
that
i
do
not
know
i
have
told
you
all
that
i
know
said
tarook
is
somewhere
on
shore
and
so
far
as
i
can
tell
all
the
water
is
inside
him
but
i
do
not
know
where
he
is
nor
if
you
can
do
anything
now
i
must
go
back
to
my
young
ones
for
they
will
certainly
be
hungry
and
my
mate
will
be
cross
he
bowed
to
the
kangaroo
and
flew
up
into
the
air
then
he
went
skimming
over
the
forest
to
the
sea
when
he
had
gone
the
animals
talked
again
but
there
was
great
grief
among
them
and
they
did
not
know
what
to
do
at
last
it
was
agreed
that
malian
the
eaglehawk
should
fly
to
the
shore
and
find
out
anything
he
could
about
so
huge
a
frog
they
thought
could
not
hide
himself
from
the
eyes
of
an
eaglehawk
which
can
see
even
a
little
in
the
grass
as
he
flies
so
mirran
the
kangaroo
bade
malian
be
as
quick
as
possible
and
he
flew
off
while
all
the
people
awaited
his
return
as
patiently
as
they
could
but
they
were
too
thirsty
to
be
very
patient
it
was
evening
when
malian
returned
the
day
had
seemed
very
long
and
he
was
tired
for
it
is
not
easy
to
fly
for
a
long
while
without
water
is
the
most
terrible
frog
you
could
imagine
he
said
he
is
squatting
on
a
rise
not
far
from
the
sea
and
he
has
drunk
so
much
that
he
can
not
move
his
body
is
swelled
up
so
that
he
is
bigger
than
anything
that
ever
existed
bigger
than
the
little
hill
on
which
he
sits
nothing
could
possibly
be
so
large
as
he
is
he
does
not
speak
at
all
but
what
is
to
be
done
cried
the
other
animals
i
asked
every
one
i
met
but
they
could
not
tell
me
so
at
last
i
found
old
blook
the
bullfrog
for
it
struck
me
that
he
would
know
more
of
the
ways
of
other
frogs
than
anyone
else
i
found
him
with
great
difficulty
and
for
a
long
time
he
was
too
angry
to
speak
for
he
has
now
no
water
to
remain
in
and
none
to
drink
but
he
knows
all
about
he
says
that
now
he
has
inside
him
all
the
waters
that
should
cover
the
waste
places
of
the
earth
but
that
we
shall
never
have
water
unless
he
can
be
made
to
laugh
to
laugh
cried
the
animals
who
can
make
a
frog
laugh
blook
knows
he
can
not
so
that
is
why
he
is
angry
answered
malian
but
that
is
the
only
way
if
laughs
all
the
water
will
run
out
of
his
mouth
and
there
will
once
more
be
plenty
for
every
one
but
unless
he
laughs
he
will
sit
there
for
ever
unable
to
move
and
soon
we
shall
all
die
of
thirst
the
animals
talked
over
this
bad
news
for
a
long
time
and
at
last
they
agreed
that
every
one
who
could
be
at
all
funny
must
go
and
try
to
make
laugh
a
great
many
at
once
said
that
they
could
be
funny
but
when
they
were
tried
their
performances
were
so
dull
that
most
of
those
who
looked
on
were
quite
annoyed
and
refused
to
let
them
go
near
the
frog
for
fear
he
should
lose
his
temper
instead
of
laughing
however
every
one
was
too
thirsty
to
wait
to
try
all
those
willing
to
undertake
to
make
him
merry
and
they
set
off
through
the
bush
in
a
queer
company
the
animals
running
hopping
or
walking
the
snakes
and
reptiles
crawling
and
the
birds
flying
overhead
the
water
will
run
back
to
you
before
we
do
they
cried
to
the
wives
and
young
ones
they
were
leaving
behind
but
that
was
just
a
piece
of
brave
talk
for
in
reality
they
did
not
feel
at
all
sure
about
it
they
hurried
through
the
scrub
getting
more
and
more
scattered
as
they
went
along
for
the
swift
ones
would
not
wait
for
those
who
were
slower
in
the
early
morning
the
leaders
came
out
of
the
trees
and
found
themselves
on
a
swampy
plain
leading
to
the
sea
all
the
water
had
dried
up
and
a
creek
that
had
its
course
through
it
was
also
dry
it
was
a
very
place
not
far
from
the
beach
there
was
a
little
hill
and
sitting
on
it
they
saw
the
monster
frog
he
was
a
terrible
creature
in
appearance
for
he
was
so
immense
that
the
hill
was
lost
under
him
just
like
a
hugely
fat
man
sitting
on
a
button
mushroom
he
was
so
swelled
up
that
it
seemed
that
if
anything
pricked
him
he
would
burst
like
a
balloon
but
when
they
came
near
him
they
saw
how
thick
his
skin
was
and
knew
that
no
prick
would
go
through
it
his
beady
eyes
were
bulging
out
and
though
they
tried
to
attract
his
attention
he
only
gazed
out
to
sea
and
took
no
notice
of
them
at
all
well
he
has
certainly
had
a
great
drink
but
he
does
not
look
as
if
he
had
enjoyed
it
remarked
mirran
hopping
round
him
i
should
think
he
would
find
himself
more
comfortable
under
the
sea
than
sitting
on
that
poor
little
hill
said
merkein
the
jackass
he
will
probably
go
back
to
the
sea
the
native
companion
answered
let
us
hope
he
will
not
take
all
the
water
with
him
how
uncomfortable
he
must
be
why
he
is
like
a
mountain
hissed
mumung
the
black
snake
may
i
not
go
and
bite
him
certainly
not
said
mirran
hastily
it
might
make
him
angry
or
he
might
die
and
we
do
not
want
the
water
poisoned
unless
you
can
make
him
laugh
you
had
better
get
into
your
hole
so
mumung
subsided
muttering
angrily
to
himself
then
the
animals
began
to
try
to
make
the
frog
laugh
it
was
the
first
circus
that
ever
was
in
australia
they
danced
and
capered
and
pranced
before
him
and
the
birds
sang
him
the
most
ridiculous
songs
they
could
think
of
and
the
insects
sat
on
his
head
and
told
him
the
funniest
stories
they
had
gathered
in
flying
round
the
world
but
he
did
not
take
the
smallest
notice
of
any
of
them
his
bulging
eyes
saw
them
all
but
not
a
word
did
he
say
it
is
very
hard
to
be
funny
when
nobody
laughs
and
the
animals
soon
became
rather
disheartened
but
mirran
would
not
let
them
stop
he
himself
did
most
wonderful
jumps
before
the
frog
and
once
hopped
right
over
the
emu
who
looked
so
comical
when
she
saw
the
great
body
sailing
over
her
that
all
the
animals
burst
out
laughing
but
the
frog
merely
looked
as
though
he
would
like
to
go
to
sleep
then
menak
the
bandicoot
brought
his
brothers
and
performed
all
kinds
of
antics
and
the
climbed
up
a
little
tree
and
hung
from
its
boughs
and
were
very
funny
in
their
gymnastics
and
the
dingo
and
his
tribe
held
a
coursing
match
round
the
hill
on
which
the
frog
sat
going
so
fast
that
no
one
could
see
where
one
yellow
dog
ended
and
the
next
began
but
none
of
these
things
amused
the
frog
at
all
he
stared
straight
in
front
of
him
and
if
possible
he
looked
a
little
more
bulgy
but
that
was
all
the
animals
held
another
council
and
tried
to
think
of
other
funny
things
mirran
remembered
how
the
jackass
had
laughed
when
he
had
sat
down
on
kowern
the
porcupine
and
though
that
had
been
a
most
unpleasant
experience
for
him
he
bravely
offered
to
do
it
again
kowern
however
did
not
like
the
idea
and
scuttled
away
into
a
hole
and
they
had
great
difficulty
in
finding
him
and
when
they
did
find
him
it
was
quite
another
matter
to
make
him
come
out
at
last
they
induced
him
to
appear
and
to
let
mirran
sit
on
him
but
it
was
not
a
successful
experiment
perhaps
mirran
was
nervous
for
he
knew
how
it
felt
to
sit
on
kowern
quills
and
so
he
let
himself
down
gently
and
kowern
gave
a
heavy
groan
but
no
one
even
smiled
as
for
the
frog
he
was
heard
to
snore
it
was
all
rather
hard
on
mirran
for
the
experiment
hurt
him
just
as
much
as
if
it
had
been
quite
successful
so
the
day
went
on
and
when
it
was
nearly
evening
the
animals
could
do
no
more
and
still
sat
and
stared
stupidly
before
him
and
looked
more
and
more
huge
and
bulgy
in
the
gathering
darkness
and
waat
the
red
wallaby
declared
that
the
little
hill
he
sat
on
was
beginning
to
flatten
under
his
weight
they
were
quite
hopeless
at
last
all
were
so
tired
and
thirsty
that
they
could
not
have
attempted
more
antics
even
had
they
known
any
but
indeed
they
had
done
everything
they
knew
they
sat
in
a
round
the
great
frog
and
looked
at
him
sadly
and
the
frog
sat
on
his
hill
and
did
not
look
at
anything
at
all
just
about
this
time
the
great
eel
woke
up
he
was
lying
in
a
deep
crack
in
the
muddy
bed
of
the
creek
and
when
the
mud
dried
and
hardened
it
pinched
him
and
he
squirmed
and
woke
to
his
surprise
there
was
no
water
anywhere
wriggled
out
of
his
crack
very
astonished
and
indignant
he
found
all
the
dry
as
you
know
so
he
wriggled
across
it
and
up
the
bank
and
came
out
on
a
little
by
the
sea
there
he
looked
about
him
on
one
side
the
sea
rippled
but
knew
that
its
water
was
no
good
for
him
on
the
other
was
only
dry
land
the
swampy
ground
he
knew
and
loved
but
now
there
was
no
water
in
it
it
was
very
puzzling
to
a
sleepy
eel
he
looked
a
little
farther
and
saw
the
great
frog
sitting
on
his
hill
but
he
looked
so
huge
that
thought
the
hill
had
simply
grown
bigger
while
he
slept
and
though
that
was
surprising
it
was
not
nearly
so
surprising
as
finding
no
water
then
he
saw
all
the
animals
sitting
about
him
but
he
took
no
notice
of
them
all
he
cared
for
was
to
get
away
from
this
hot
dry
mud
and
find
a
cool
creek
running
over
its
soft
bed
so
he
wriggled
on
making
very
good
time
across
the
flat
nobody
saw
him
for
all
the
animals
were
looking
miserably
at
the
frog
kowern
the
porcupine
had
felt
very
sore
and
bruised
after
mirran
had
sat
on
him
for
the
second
time
he
was
a
sulky
fellow
and
he
did
not
want
to
be
sat
on
any
more
even
if
it
were
for
the
good
of
all
the
people
mirran
will
be
making
a
habit
of
this
soon
he
said
crossly
i
will
get
out
of
the
way
so
he
hurried
off
and
got
into
the
nearest
hole
which
happened
to
be
near
the
edge
of
the
there
he
went
to
sleep
came
wriggling
along
hating
the
hard
ground
and
only
wanting
to
get
to
a
decent
creek
he
was
in
such
a
hurry
that
he
did
not
see
kowern
and
he
wiggled
right
across
him
and
it
seemed
to
him
that
each
of
kowern
spines
found
a
different
place
in
his
soft
body
cried
out
very
loudly
and
threw
himself
backwards
to
get
off
those
dreadful
spikes
he
was
too
sore
to
creep
at
all
the
only
part
of
him
that
was
not
hurt
was
the
very
point
of
his
tail
and
he
stood
up
on
that
and
danced
about
in
his
wrath
and
pain
with
his
body
wriggling
in
the
air
and
his
mouth
wide
open
and
when
the
monster
frog
caught
sight
of
the
eel
dancing
on
his
tail
on
the
he
opened
his
mouth
and
let
out
such
a
great
shout
of
laughter
as
had
never
been
heard
before
in
the
world
or
will
ever
be
heard
again
then
all
the
waters
came
rushing
out
of
the
frog
mouth
and
in
a
moment
the
dry
swamp
was
filled
with
it
and
a
sheet
of
water
rushed
over
the
where
was
dancing
and
carried
him
away
which
was
exactly
what
liked
and
made
him
forget
all
his
sores
it
was
not
so
nice
for
kowern
the
porcupine
for
he
was
swept
away
too
and
as
he
could
not
swim
he
was
drowned
but
he
was
so
that
nobody
cared
very
much
went
on
laughing
and
the
water
kept
pouring
out
of
his
open
mouth
and
as
he
laughed
he
shrank
and
shrank
and
his
skin
became
flabby
and
hung
in
folds
about
him
he
shrank
until
he
was
only
as
large
as
a
few
ordinary
frogs
put
together
and
then
he
gave
a
loud
croak
and
dived
off
into
the
water
he
swam
away
and
none
of
the
animals
ever
saw
him
again
at
that
moment
the
animals
were
much
too
busy
with
their
own
affairs
to
think
much
about
when
the
water
first
appeared
they
rushed
at
it
eagerly
and
each
drank
as
much
as
he
could
then
they
felt
better
and
looked
about
them
mirran
the
kangaroo
was
the
first
to
make
a
discovery
ky
it
will
be
a
flood
said
he
a
flood
nonsense
said
warreen
the
wombat
why
ten
minutes
ago
it
was
a
drought
yes
and
now
it
will
be
a
flood
said
mirran
watching
keenly
look
the
water
had
run
all
over
the
plain
filling
up
the
swamp
and
already
the
creek
showed
like
a
line
of
silver
where
but
a
few
moments
ago
there
had
been
only
dry
mud
but
it
was
plain
that
the
water
could
not
get
away
quickly
enough
all
the
plain
was
like
a
sea
and
there
were
big
waves
washing
round
the
little
hills
save
yourselves
cried
mirran
to
the
people
soon
there
will
be
no
dry
land
at
all
he
set
off
with
great
bounds
thinking
of
his
mate
and
the
little
ones
he
had
left
in
the
forest
behind
him
came
all
the
people
running
jumping
and
crawling
and
behind
them
came
the
water
in
one
great
wave
some
reached
the
high
ground
of
the
forest
first
and
found
safety
and
others
took
refuge
on
hills
while
those
that
could
climb
fled
up
trees
but
many
could
not
get
away
quickly
and
the
waters
caught
them
and
they
were
drowned
next
morning
the
animals
who
were
saved
gathered
at
the
edge
of
the
forest
and
looked
over
the
flood
it
stretched
quite
across
the
plain
and
between
it
and
the
sea
was
only
the
yellow
line
of
the
nearer
to
the
forest
were
a
few
little
hills
and
on
these
could
be
seen
forlorn
figures
huddling
together
for
warmth
for
the
air
had
become
very
cold
there
are
some
of
our
people
cried
mirran
in
a
loud
voice
how
are
we
to
rescue
them
no
one
could
answer
this
question
none
of
the
animals
could
swim
and
if
they
had
been
able
to
do
so
they
had
still
no
way
of
getting
the
castaways
to
dry
land
they
could
only
look
at
them
and
weep
because
they
were
so
helpless
after
awhile
booran
the
pelican
came
flying
up
in
a
state
of
great
excitement
have
you
seen
them
he
cried
waat
is
there
and
little
tonga
the
and
old
warreen
and
a
lot
of
others
and
soon
they
will
die
of
cold
and
hunger
if
they
are
not
saved
so
i
must
save
them
you
said
all
the
animals
there
no
need
to
say
it
in
that
tone
said
booran
angrily
i
can
make
a
canoe
and
sail
over
quite
easily
it
will
please
me
very
much
to
save
the
poor
things
so
booran
cut
a
big
bark
canoe
which
he
called
gre
he
was
very
proud
of
it
and
would
not
let
anyone
touch
it
or
help
him
at
all
and
when
it
was
finished
he
got
in
and
paddled
over
to
the
little
islands
where
the
animals
shivered
and
shook
with
soaked
fur
and
heavy
hearts
they
grew
excited
when
they
saw
booran
coming
and
when
he
arrived
with
his
canoe
they
nearly
tipped
it
over
by
all
trying
to
get
in
at
once
this
was
repeated
at
each
island
and
at
last
booran
lost
his
temper
altogether
and
threatened
to
leave
them
all
where
they
were
this
dreadful
idea
made
them
very
meek
and
they
were
quite
silent
as
booran
paddled
them
towards
the
shore
now
booran
had
not
a
pleasant
nature
it
did
not
suit
him
to
find
people
meek
for
it
at
once
made
him
conceited
and
inclined
to
be
a
bully
he
felt
very
important
to
be
taking
so
many
animals
back
in
his
boat
and
so
he
began
to
say
rude
things
to
them
and
in
every
way
to
be
unpleasant
the
animals
bore
this
quietly
for
a
time
for
they
were
too
cold
to
want
to
dispute
with
him
and
besides
they
were
really
very
grateful
for
being
saved
but
after
a
while
he
became
so
overbearing
that
waat
the
red
wallaby
answered
him
back
sharply
and
others
joined
in
before
they
got
to
shore
they
were
all
quarrelling
violently
and
when
they
had
only
a
few
yards
to
go
booran
suddenly
stopped
paddling
and
jumped
out
so
quickly
that
he
upset
the
canoe
and
threw
all
the
animals
into
the
water
he
swam
off
chuckling
and
saying
that
will
help
to
cool
your
bad
tempers
the
water
was
not
deep
and
the
animals
escaped
with
only
a
ducking
they
struggled
to
the
dry
land
very
wet
and
miserable
that
was
a
mean
trick
to
play
on
us
said
little
tonga
his
teeth
chattering
i
would
like
to
fight
booran
if
only
he
would
come
ashore
but
he
will
keep
out
of
our
way
now
ky
look
at
him
said
waat
they
looked
and
they
saw
booran
coming
in
rapidly
as
though
he
were
floating
on
the
water
and
had
no
power
to
stop
himself
his
eyes
were
fixed
and
glassy
and
his
great
beak
wide
open
a
wave
brought
him
right
up
on
the
shore
and
blew
over
him
in
a
cloud
of
spray
when
the
spray
had
gone
booran
had
gone
too
and
where
he
had
lain
on
the
bank
was
a
big
rock
shaped
something
like
a
pelican
that
was
the
story
old
conara
told
me
as
we
fished
for
murray
cod
together
he
said
that
all
his
people
knew
the
rock
and
called
it
the
pelican
rock
and
it
stood
on
the
plain
long
after
booran
and
his
children
children
children
were
almost
forgotten
the
plain
is
dry
and
no
water
ever
lodges
there
but
when
the
blacks
see
the
pelican
rock
they
think
of
the
time
when
it
was
all
in
flood
when
the
great
frog
nearly
caused
all
the
animals
to
die
of
thirst
and
when
the
eel
saved
them
by
dancing
on
his
tail
on
a
by

who

chapter
i
very
long
ago
before
the
white
man
came
to
conquer
the
land
a
tribe
of
black
people
lived
in
a
great
forest
beyond
their
country
was
a
range
of
mountains
which
separated
them
from
another
tribe
of
fierce
and
warlike
blacks
and
on
one
side
they
were
bounded
by
the
sea
they
were
a
prosperous
tribe
for
not
only
was
there
plenty
of
game
in
the
forest
to
give
them
food
and
rugs
of
skins
for
clothing
but
the
sea
gave
them
fish
and
fish
were
useful
both
to
eat
and
for
their
bones
the
blacks
made
many
things
out
of
and
found
them
very
useful
for
tipping
spears
and
other
weapons
being
so
powerful
a
tribe
they
were
not
much
molested
by
other
blacks
the
mountains
to
the
north
were
their
chief
protection
no
wandering
parties
of
fighting
men
were
likely
to
cross
them
and
surprise
the
tribe
for
they
were
steep
and
rugged
and
full
of
ravines
and
deep
gullies
that
were
difficult
to
cross
unless
you
knew
the
right
tracks
the
nearest
tribe
had
come
over
more
than
once
and
great
battles
had
taken
place
but
the
was
always
prepared
for
the
noise
of
their
coming
was
too
great
to
be
hidden
there
had
been
great
fights
but
the
had
always
won
now
they
were
too
strong
to
fear
any
attack
so
strong
were
they
indeed
that
they
did
not
trouble
about
fighting
but
only
wished
to
be
peaceful
their
life
was
a
very
simple
and
happy
one
and
they
did
not
want
anything
better
the
tribe
was
called
the
baringa
tribe
and
the
name
of
its
chief
was
wadaro
he
was
a
tall
silent
man
very
proud
of
his
people
and
their
country
and
of
his
six
big
sons
all
strong
like
himself
but
most
of
all
he
was
proud
of
his
daughter
miraga
miraga
was
just
of
woman
age
and
no
girl
in
all
the
tribe
was
so
beautiful
she
was
straight
and
supple
as
a
young
sapling
lissom
as
the
tendrils
of
the
clematis
and
beautiful
as
the
dawn
striking
on
the
face
of
the
waters
her
deep
eyes
were
full
of
light
and
she
was
always
merry
the
little
children
loved
her
and
used
to
bring
her
blossoms
of
the
red
native
fuchsia
to
twine
in
her
glossy
black
hair
most
blacks
men
and
women
look
on
everything
they
meet
with
one
thought
they
ask
is
it
good
to
eat
but
miraga
was
different
she
had
made
friends
with
many
of
the
little
animals
of
the
bush
and
they
were
her
playmates
bandicoots
and
other
tiny
things
they
were
quite
easy
to
tame
if
anyone
tried
even
snappy
little
yikaura
the
native
cat
with
its
spotted
body
and
fierce
sharp
head
became
quite
gentle
with
miraga
and
did
not
try
to
touch
her
other
pets
she
begged
the
tribe
not
to
eat
the
animals
she
loved
and
they
consented
of
course
in
many
tribes
it
would
have
been
necessary
to
go
on
using
them
for
food
and
any
woman
who
tried
to
save
them
would
only
have
been
laughed
at
but
the
baringa
folk
had
so
much
food
that
they
could
easily
afford
to
spare
these
little
furry
things
besides
it
was
miraga
who
asked
and
was
she
not
the
chief
daughter
however
it
was
not
only
because
she
was
the
chief
daughter
that
the
people
loved
miraga
and
did
what
she
asked
them
she
was
always
kind
and
merry
and
went
about
the
camp
singing
happily
generally
with
a
cluster
of
children
running
after
her
if
anyone
were
sick
she
was
very
good
bringing
food
and
medicines
being
the
daughter
of
wadaro
the
chief
she
might
have
escaped
all
work
but
instead
she
did
her
share
and
used
to
go
out
digging
for
yams
and
other
roots
with
the
other
girls
of
the
tribe
the
happiest
of
them
all
the
tribe
beyond
the
northern
hills
was
called
the
burrin
they
were
very
fierce
and
had
many
but
their
country
was
not
so
good
as
that
of
the
baringa
and
they
were
very
jealous
of
the
happy
one
time
they
came
to
the
conclusion
that
it
was
long
since
they
had
had
a
fight
and
that
it
would
be
a
very
good
thing
to
try
and
win
the
baringa
country
they
did
not
want
to
go
over
the
mountains
unprepared
so
they
sent
a
picked
band
of
young
men
telling
them
to
cross
into
the
land
of
the
baringas
and
find
out
if
they
were
very
strong
and
if
there
were
still
much
game
in
the
forest
they
were
not
to
fight
but
only
to
prowl
in
the
forest
and
watch
the
stealthily
then
they
were
to
return
over
the
mountains
with
their
report
so
that
the
of
the
burrin
could
decide
whether
it
were
wise
to
send
all
their
over
to
try
and
conquer
the
baringa
the
little
band
of
burrin
men
set
off
with
great
pride
their
leader
was
the
chief
son
yurong
who
was
stronger
than
any
man
of
his
tribe
and
of
a
very
fierce
and
cruel
nature
he
was
not
yet
married
although
that
was
only
due
to
an
accident
once
he
had
been
about
to
take
a
wife
and
had
gone
to
her
camp
and
hit
her
on
the
head
with
a
waddy
which
was
one
of
the
blacks
customs
in
some
tribes
before
carrying
her
to
his
own
wurley
but
he
hit
too
hard
and
the
poor
girl
died
which
caused
yurong
a
great
deal
of
inconvenience
because
her
parents
wanted
to
kill
him
too
it
was
only
because
he
was
the
son
that
he
escaped
with
his
life
now
he
was
still
unmarried
because
no
girl
would
look
at
him
it
made
yurong
more
than
he
was
naturally
and
that
is
saying
a
good
deal
he
had
great
hopes
from
the
expedition
into
the
baringa
country
if
he
came
back
successful
and
won
a
name
for
himself
as
a
fighter
he
thought
that
all
the
maidens
of
his
tribe
would
admire
him
and
forget
that
he
had
been
so
ready
with
his
stick
when
he
was
betrothed
first
yurong
and
his
band
left
the
plain
where
the
burrin
tribe
roamed
and
journeyed
over
the
mountains
they
did
not
find
any
great
difficulties
for
they
had
been
told
where
to
find
the
best
tracks
and
they
had
scarcely
any
loads
to
hamper
them
it
was
and
the
lightest
of
rugs
served
them
for
covering
at
night
even
in
the
keener
air
of
the
hills
there
was
no
difficulty
in
finding
food
or
water
and
the
stars
were
their
guides
when
they
came
to
the
country
of
the
baringas
they
went
very
cautiously
for
they
did
not
wish
to
encounter
any
of
wadaro
men
in
the
daytime
they
hid
themselves
in
gullies
or
in
bends
of
the
creek
only
coming
out
when
their
scouts
knew
that
no
enemies
were
near
but
at
night
they
travelled
fast
and
before
long
they
climbed
up
a
great
hill
that
lay
across
their
path
and
from
its
topmost
peak
they
saw
the
gleaming
line
of
the
sea
then
watching
they
saw
smoke
drifting
over
the
trees
and
they
knew
they
had
found
wadaro
camp
they
became
more
careful
than
ever
knowing
that
now
was
their
greatest
danger
sometimes
they
hid
in
trees
or
in
caves
in
the
rocks
all
the
time
watching
and
noting
in
their
memories
the
number
of
the
men
they
saw
and
the
signs
of
abundance
of
game
there
was
no
doubt
that
this
was
a
far
better
country
than
their
own
and
they
thirsted
to
possess
it
at
the
same
time
they
could
see
how
strong
the
baringas
were
even
their
womenfolk
were
tall
and
straight
and
strong
and
would
help
to
fight
for
their
land
and
their
freedom
the
burrin
men
used
to
see
them
when
they
went
out
to
dig
in
the
bush
a
merry
laughing
band
always
with
them
was
a
beautiful
girl
with
red
flowers
in
her
hair
yurong
would
watch
her
closely
from
his
and
he
made
up
his
mind
that
when
the
fighting
was
over
this
girl
should
be
the
chief
part
of
his
share
of
the
spoils
he
was
so
conceited
that
he
never
dreamed
that
his
tribe
would
not
win
but
misfortune
fell
upon
yurong
and
his
little
band
they
were
prowling
round
the
outskirts
of
wadaro
camp
one
night
when
a
woman
hushing
her
crying
baby
to
sleep
caught
a
glimpse
of
the
black
forms
flitting
among
the
trees
she
gave
the
alarm
silently
and
silently
the
of
the
baringas
hurled
themselves
upon
the
intruders
there
was
no
time
to
flee
the
burrin
men
fought
fiercely
knowing
that
escape
was
hopeless
one
by
one
they
were
killed
yurong
was
the
last
left
alive
he
turned
and
ran
when
the
last
of
his
comrades
fell
a
dozen
baringas
at
his
heels
the
first
he
slew
turning
on
him
and
striking
him
down
then
he
ran
on
wildly
hearing
behind
him
the
hard
breathing
of
the
pursuing
warriors
suddenly
the
ground
under
his
feet
gave
way
he
fell
down
down
into
blackness
shouting
as
he
went
then
he
struck
icy
water
with
a
great
splash
when
he
came
to
the
surface
he
could
see
the
moonlight
far
above
him
and
hear
the
voices
of
the
baringa
men
loud
and
excited
then
he
went
under
once
more
on
the
steep
and
lofty
the
baringas
watched
the
black
pool
where
yurong
had
disappeared
there
was
no
sign
of
life
there
he
is
gone
they
said
at
last
no
man
ever
came
alive
out
of
that
place
well
it
is
a
good
thing
they
watched
awhile
longer
and
then
turned
back
to
the
camp
where
songs
of
victory
were
ringing
out
among
the
trees
chapter
ii
but
yurong
did
not
die
when
he
sank
for
the
second
time
he
did
it
on
purpose
the
fall
had
not
hurt
him
and
his
mind
worked
quickly
for
he
knew
that
only
cunning
could
save
him
he
swam
under
water
for
a
few
moments
letting
himself
go
with
the
current
but
presently
a
kind
of
eddy
dragged
him
down
and
he
found
himself
against
a
wall
of
rock
which
blocked
the
way
so
that
there
seemed
to
be
no
escape
but
even
in
his
agony
he
remembered
that
so
long
as
the
current
ran
there
must
be
some
way
out
and
he
dived
deeply
into
the
eddy
it
took
him
through
a
hole
in
the
rock
far
under
the
water
scraping
him
cruelly
against
the
edges
but
still
he
was
through
and
on
the
other
side
he
rose
gasping
here
the
river
was
wider
and
shallower
and
not
so
swift
yurong
let
it
carry
him
for
awhile
then
he
scrambled
out
on
one
side
and
found
a
under
a
great
boulder
he
rubbed
himself
down
with
rushes
shivering
then
crouching
in
his
hole
he
slept
when
he
awoke
he
knew
that
now
he
should
not
lose
a
moment
in
getting
back
to
his
tribe
he
had
learned
the
fighting
strength
of
the
baringas
with
all
else
that
he
had
come
to
find
out
but
besides
that
he
had
now
the
deaths
of
his
comrades
to
avenge
and
yet
three
days
later
yurong
was
still
in
hiding
near
the
enemy
camp
he
had
made
up
his
wicked
mind
that
when
he
went
away
he
would
take
with
him
the
beautiful
girl
he
had
so
often
seen
in
the
forest
with
her
companions
quite
unconscious
of
her
danger
miraga
went
about
her
daily
work
the
sight
of
her
and
the
beauty
of
her
burned
into
yurong
brain
often
in
the
forest
he
dogged
her
footsteps
but
the
other
girls
were
always
near
her
and
he
dared
not
try
to
carry
her
away
he
knew
now
she
was
the
chief
daughter
and
he
smiled
to
think
that
through
her
he
could
deal
the
cruellest
blow
to
wadaro
besides
gaining
for
himself
the
loveliest
wife
in
all
the
bush
but
out
in
the
scrub
the
girls
clustered
about
miraga
and
in
the
camp
the
young
men
were
never
far
from
her
there
was
not
one
of
them
who
would
not
have
gladly
taken
her
as
his
bride
but
she
told
her
father
that
she
was
too
young
to
think
of
being
married
and
wadaro
was
glad
enough
to
keep
her
by
his
side
but
yurong
fiercely
jealous
could
see
that
there
was
one
man
on
whom
miraga
eyes
would
often
turn
when
he
was
not
looking
in
her
direction
a
tall
fellow
named
konawarr
the
swan
who
loved
her
so
dearly
that
indeed
he
scarcely
gave
her
a
chance
to
look
at
him
since
he
so
rarely
took
his
gaze
from
her
he
was
the
leader
of
the
young
and
a
great
hunter
and
yurong
thirsted
to
kill
him
as
the
kangaroos
thirst
for
the
creeks
in
summer
when
drought
has
laid
his
withering
hand
upon
the
waters
so
five
days
went
by
in
the
forest
yurong
hid
living
on
very
little
food
for
he
dared
not
often
go
hunting
and
always
watching
the
camp
and
miraga
never
dreaming
of
the
danger
near
her
lived
her
simple
happy
life
the
children
always
thronged
round
her
when
she
moved
about
the
camp
and
she
would
pause
to
fondle
the
little
naked
black
babies
that
tumbled
round
the
wurleys
tossing
them
in
the
air
until
they
shouted
with
laughter
yurong
saw
with
amazement
how
the
little
animals
came
to
her
and
played
at
her
feet
and
it
impressed
him
greatly
with
a
sense
of
the
wealth
of
the
baringa
tribe
ky
he
said
to
himself
they
are
able
to
use
food
for
playthings
never
before
had
he
dreamed
of
such
a
thing
one
evening
the
girls
went
out
into
the
scrub
each
carrying
her
and
the
netted
bag
into
which
the
black
women
put
everything
from
food
to
miraga
was
woven
of
red
and
white
rushes
with
a
quaint
pattern
on
one
side
and
she
was
very
proud
of
it
for
it
had
been
konawarr
gift
she
was
thinking
of
his
kind
eyes
as
she
walked
through
the
trees
brushing
aside
tendrils
of
starry
clematis
and
wild
convolvulus
and
finding
a
way
through
musk
and
hazel
thickets
he
had
looked
at
her
very
gently
when
he
gave
her
the
bag
and
she
knew
that
she
could
trust
him
she
was
very
happy
as
she
wandered
on
so
happy
that
she
did
not
notice
for
a
while
that
she
had
strayed
some
distance
from
the
other
girls
and
that
already
the
shadows
were
creeping
about
the
forest
to
make
the
darkness
i
am
too
far
from
camp
she
said
aloud
i
must
hurry
back
or
my
father
will
be
angry
she
turned
to
retrace
her
steps
pausing
a
moment
to
make
sure
of
her
direction
then
from
the
gloom
of
a
tall
clump
of
dogwood
something
sprang
upon
her
and
seized
her
she
struggled
sending
a
stifled
cry
into
the
forest
but
it
died
as
a
heavy
blow
from
a
waddy
took
away
her
senses
yurong
carried
her
swiftly
away
day
came
and
found
them
still
fleeing
miraga
a
helpless
burden
in
her
captor
arms
days
and
nights
passed
and
still
they
travelled
northwards
across
the
rivers
the
forest
and
the
mountains
they
went
slowly
for
at
length
yurong
could
carry
the
girl
no
farther
and
at
first
she
was
too
weak
to
walk
much
even
when
she
grew
stronger
she
still
pretended
to
be
weak
doing
all
in
her
power
to
delay
their
flight
always
straining
her
ears
in
the
wild
hope
that
behind
her
she
might
hear
the
feet
of
the
men
coming
to
save
her
led
by
wadaro
and
by
konawarr
somewhere
she
knew
they
were
searching
for
her
but
as
the
days
went
by
and
no
help
came
her
heart
began
to
sink
hopelessly
yurong
was
not
unkind
to
her
he
treated
her
gently
enough
telling
her
she
was
to
be
his
wife
but
she
hated
him
more
and
more
deeply
each
hour
thinking
her
very
weak
he
let
her
travel
slowly
and
helped
her
over
the
rough
places
though
she
shrank
from
his
touch
but
he
took
no
risks
with
her
he
kept
his
weapons
carefully
out
of
her
reach
and
at
night
when
they
slept
he
bound
her
feet
and
hands
with
strips
of
so
that
she
might
not
try
to
escape
then
they
came
to
the
topmost
crest
of
the
mountains
and
below
them
yurong
could
see
the
country
of
his
people
at
that
miraga
gave
up
all
hope
they
camped
on
the
ridge
that
night
and
for
the
first
time
she
sobbed
herself
to
sleep
she
woke
up
a
while
later
with
a
sound
of
little
whispers
in
her
ears
it
was
quite
dark
inside
the
wurley
but
she
heard
a
patter
of
tiny
scurrying
feet
and
a
few
faint
squeaks
miraga
lay
very
still
trembling
then
a
shrill
little
voice
came
very
close
to
her
mistress
oh
mistress
who
is
it
she
whispered
we
are
your
little
people
came
the
faint
voice
lie
very
still
and
we
will
set
you
free
on
her
hand
miraga
felt
a
patter
of
tiny
feet
like
snowflakes
falling
they
ran
all
over
her
body
she
felt
them
down
at
her
bare
ankles
and
near
her
face
she
knew
them
now
though
it
was
dark
little
the
and
punta
the
and
kanungo
the
with
the
bandicoot
talka
they
were
all
her
friends
her
little
people
dozens
of
them
seemed
to
be
there
in
the
dark
nibbling
furiously
at
the
strips
of
hide
on
her
wrists
and
ankles
how
long
the
time
seemed
as
she
lay
trembling
in
great
fear
lest
yurong
should
awaken
the
very
sound
of
her
own
breathing
was
loud
in
her
ears
and
the
faint
rustlings
of
the
little
people
seemed
a
noise
that
must
surely
wake
the
sleeping
warrior
but
yurong
was
tired
and
he
slept
soundly
and
the
little
people
worked
hard
at
last
the
bonds
fell
apart
and
she
was
free
gliding
like
a
snake
she
crept
out
of
the
wurley
and
ran
swiftly
into
the
forest
that
clothed
the
mountains
but
scarcely
had
she
gone
when
yurong
woke
and
found
she
was
not
there
he
sprang
to
his
feet
with
a
shout
grasping
his
weapons
and
rushed
outside
there
was
no
sign
of
miraga
but
his
quick
ear
caught
the
sound
of
a
breaking
twig
in
the
forest
and
he
raced
in
pursuit
again
he
heard
it
this
time
so
close
that
he
knew
she
could
not
be
more
than
a
few
yards
away
then
he
found
himself
suddenly
on
the
edge
of
a
great
wall
of
rock
and
there
was
no
time
to
stop
he
shouted
again
in
despair
as
he
fell
down
down
then
no
more
sounds
came
but
just
on
the
edge
of
the
precipice
three
bandicoots
came
out
of
a
heap
of
dry
sticks
laughing
that
was
easily
done
said
one
it
was
only
necessary
to
jump
up
and
down
among
the
sticks
and
break
a
few
and
the
silly
fellow
made
sure
it
was
miraga
well
he
will
not
make
any
more
foolish
mistakes
said
his
brother
but
is
it
not
surprising
to
find
how
simple
these
humans
are
all
but
our
mistress
the
first
said
come
we
must
make
haste
to
follow
her
or
else
we
shall
have
another
long
hunt
and
nobody
knows
what
mischief
she
may
fall
into
if
we
are
not
there
to
look
after
her
chapter
iii
miraga
ran
swiftly
into
the
heart
of
the
forest
glancing
back
in
terror
lest
at
any
moment
she
should
see
yurong
she
heard
him
shout
and
the
crash
of
his
feet
in
pursuit
as
he
plunged
out
of
the
wurley
and
for
a
moment
she
gave
herself
up
for
lost
he
was
so
swift
and
so
strong
she
knew
that
she
could
never
escape
him
once
he
was
on
her
track
another
cry
reached
her
presently
not
so
close
it
gave
her
her
first
throb
of
hope
that
yurong
had
taken
the
wrong
turning
among
the
trees
still
she
was
far
too
terrified
to
slacken
speed
she
fled
on
not
knowing
where
she
was
going
a
great
mountain
peak
loomed
before
her
and
she
fled
up
it
it
was
hard
climbing
but
it
seemed
to
her
safer
than
the
dark
forest
where
at
any
moment
yurong
black
face
might
appear
here
at
least
she
might
be
safe
at
least
he
would
not
think
of
looking
for
her
in
this
wild
and
rugged
place
perhaps
if
she
hid
on
the
mountain
for
a
few
days
he
would
grow
tired
of
looking
for
her
and
go
away
back
to
his
own
people
and
then
she
could
try
to
find
her
way
home
at
the
very
thought
of
home
poor
miraga
sobbed
as
she
ran
it
seemed
so
long
since
the
happy
days
in
the
camp
by
the
sea
the
way
was
strange
she
climbed
up
among
great
boulders
and
jagged
crags
of
rock
above
her
the
peaks
seemed
to
pierce
the
sky
deep
ravines
were
here
and
there
and
she
started
away
from
their
edges
somewhere
water
fell
swiftly
racing
down
some
narrow
bed
among
the
rocks
so
she
went
on
and
the
moonlight
grew
stronger
and
stronger
until
it
flooded
all
the
mountain
she
fought
her
way
step
by
step
up
the
last
great
peak
and
suddenly
in
the
midnight
she
came
out
upon
a
great
and
shining
tableland
then
she
knew
that
in
her
journeyings
she
had
found
the
moon
illustration
then
she
knew
that
in
her
journeyings
she
had
found
the
moon
she
wandered
on
in
doubt
and
fear
fear
not
of
this
strange
new
land
but
of
the
men
she
dreaded
to
find
there
but
for
a
long
time
she
saw
no
people
only
in
the
dim
hours
when
the
glowed
like
a
star
but
all
the
was
dark
there
came
about
her
the
little
people
that
she
knew
and
loved
and
punta
talka
and
kanungo
and
because
she
was
very
lonely
and
a
lonely
woman
loves
the
touch
of
something
small
and
soft
she
took
some
of
them
up
and
carried
them
with
her
in
her
how
did
you
know
i
was
lost
she
asked
them
how
did
we
know
they
said
laughing
at
her
why
all
the
forest
sang
of
it
the
magpie
chattered
it
in
the
dewy
mornings
and
the
told
all
about
it
to
the
creeks
in
the
gullies
would
not
leave
his
quiet
places
to
tell
the
other
animals
but
he
knew
the
creeks
would
carry
the
story
soon
there
was
no
animal
in
all
the
bush
that
did
not
know
where
you
had
gone
only
we
could
not
tell
your
own
stupid
people
for
they
would
not
understand
and
are
they
looking
for
me
miraga
asked
they
seek
for
you
night
and
day
your
father
has
led
a
party
of
to
the
east
and
konawarr
has
gone
north
with
all
his
friends
they
never
rest
all
the
time
they
seek
you
and
the
women
are
wailing
in
the
camp
and
the
little
children
crying
because
you
are
gone
that
made
miraga
cry
too
can
you
not
take
me
back
she
begged
i
can
go
if
you
will
show
me
the
way
but
the
little
people
shook
their
heads
no
we
can
not
do
that
they
said
we
can
help
you
and
we
can
talk
to
you
but
we
may
not
take
you
back
you
must
find
the
way
yourself
so
miraga
wandered
on
through
the
it
was
very
desolate
and
bare
strewn
with
rocks
and
craggy
boulders
and
to
walk
long
upon
it
was
hard
for
naked
feet
there
were
no
rivers
and
no
creeks
but
a
range
of
mountains
rose
in
one
place
and
were
so
grim
and
terrible
that
miraga
would
not
try
to
climb
them
she
found
stunted
trees
bearing
berries
which
she
ate
for
she
was
very
hungry
perhaps
they
are
poisonous
and
will
kill
me
she
said
i
do
not
think
that
greatly
matters
for
i
begin
to
feel
that
i
shall
never
get
home
but
the
berries
were
not
poisonous
indeed
miraga
felt
better
when
she
had
eaten
them
her
strength
came
back
to
her
and
her
limbs
grew
less
weary
she
put
some
of
the
berries
into
her
for
the
little
people
then
she
set
off
on
her
wanderings
again
she
did
not
know
how
long
she
had
been
in
the
after
a
while
it
seemed
that
she
had
never
done
anything
but
find
her
way
across
its
rugged
plains
seeking
ever
for
the
track
back
to
the
green
so
silent
and
strange
was
it
that
she
began
to
think
there
was
no
living
being
upon
it
but
herself
and
the
little
people
she
carried
with
her
one
day
wandering
along
a
rocky
edge
she
quite
suddenly
came
upon
the
camp
of
the
she
cried
out
in
fear
and
fled
but
he
was
awake
and
when
he
saw
this
beautiful
girl
he
rose
and
gave
chase
but
miraga
was
fleet
of
foot
and
the
was
a
fat
man
and
heavy
for
as
the
blacks
know
he
never
goes
hunting
as
men
do
but
always
sits
down
in
the
shadow
of
his
mountains
presently
he
saw
that
the
girl
was
escaping
she
drew
farther
and
farther
ahead
running
like
a
dingo
and
already
he
was
puffing
and
panting
so
he
stamped
his
foot
and
called
to
his
dogs
and
they
came
out
of
the
holes
of
the
hills
great
savage
brutes
lean
and
of
a
dark
colour
they
came
running
and
growling
and
sniffing
angrily
at
the
air
their
master
waved
his
hand
and
they
uttered
a
long
howl
and
followed
swiftly
after
miraga
now
indeed
she
thought
that
her
end
had
come
mists
swam
before
her
eyes
and
her
feet
stumbled
she
whose
limbs
were
so
lithe
and
strong
tottered
like
a
weary
old
woman
behind
her
the
long
howls
of
the
dogs
woke
terror
in
her
heart
they
drew
nearer
almost
she
could
feel
their
hot
panting
breath
but
just
as
she
was
about
to
sink
down
exhausted
the
little
people
in
the
chattered
and
called
to
her
mistress
oh
mistress
they
cried
let
us
out
that
we
may
save
you
she
heard
them
and
fumbled
with
shaking
fingers
at
the
fastening
of
the
bag
it
slipped
from
her
shoulders
and
fell
to
the
ground
and
as
it
fell
the
animals
burst
out
and
fled
in
many
directions
some
here
and
some
there
squeaking
and
chattering
and
when
the
fierce
dogs
of
the
moon
saw
them
they
forgot
to
pursue
miraga
but
turned
and
coursed
swiftly
after
the
animals
behind
them
the
shouted
vainly
to
them
there
are
no
animals
in
the
and
so
the
dogs
have
no
chance
of
hunting
but
the
sight
of
the
scampering
little
people
woke
their
instincts
and
they
dashed
after
them
wildly
they
caught
some
and
swiftly
slew
them
others
dodged
and
leaped
and
twisted
escaping
into
little
rockholes
where
the
dogs
could
not
follow
them
the
noise
of
the
hunting
and
the
deep
baying
of
the
dogs
echoed
round
the
moon
and
made
thunder
boom
among
the
stars
but
miraga
ran
on
stumbling
for
weariness
she
knew
that
the
dogs
were
no
longer
close
upon
her
but
she
dreaded
to
hear
them
again
at
any
moment
for
she
did
not
see
how
such
feeble
little
people
could
keep
them
off
for
long
so
she
ran
and
as
she
went
her
tears
fell
for
the
little
friends
who
had
given
their
lives
for
her
at
last
too
tired
to
see
where
her
stumbling
feet
had
led
her
she
came
to
the
brink
of
a
great
precipice
and
fell
down
and
down
until
her
senses
left
her
but
when
she
opened
her
eyes
again
it
was
to
meet
those
of
konawarr
and
he
was
holding
her
in
his
arms
and
calling
her
name
over
and
over
with
his
voice
full
of
pity
and
love
and
behind
him
were
his
friends
all
the
band
who
had
been
seeking
her
with
him
they
were
all
smiling
to
her
with
welcome
and
joy
on
each
friendly
face
for
in
her
fall
she
had
come
back
to
the
dear
once
more
and
her
sorrows
were
at
an
end
so
when
the
tribes
look
up
to
the
sky
on
moonlit
nights
and
see
the
great
shape
that
looms
across
the
brightness
they
say
it
is
the
mighty
who
like
themselves
is
black
but
grown
heavy
and
slothful
with
much
idleness
and
the
parents
scare
idle
children
with
his
name
saying
that
if
they
do
not
bestir
themselves
they
too
will
become
fat
and
useless
like
him
but
miraga
used
to
tell
her
children
another
story
and
when
she
told
it
her
eyes
would
brim
with
tears
it
was
the
story
of
the
little
people
she
loved
who
followed
her
to
the
and
there
gave
up
their
lives
for
her
saving
her
first
from
yurong
and
then
from
the
teeth
of
the
dogs
of
the
moon
and
the
children
would
shiver
a
little
clustering
more
closely
all
save
little
konawarr
who
would
grasp
his
tiny
boomerang
and
declare
that
he
would
kill
anything
that
dared
to
hurt
his
mother
the
great
dogs
still
crouch
around
the
waiting
to
do
his
bidding
you
can
see
them
if
you
look
closely
dark
spots
near
the
huge
figure
in
the
midst
of
the
brightness
they
are
the
fierce
dogs
that
guard
the
lonely
country
in
the
sky
the
dogs
that
long
ago
hunted
howling
after
miraga
the
beautiful
across
the
shining
spaces
of
the
moon
ix
mirran
and
warreen
mirran
the
kangaroo
and
warreen
the
wombat
were
once
men
they
did
not
belong
to
any
tribe
but
they
lived
together
and
were
quite
happy
nobody
wanted
them
and
they
did
not
want
anybody
so
was
quite
satisfactory
warreen
was
the
first
all
his
tribe
had
been
drowned
in
a
flood
leaving
him
quite
alone
so
he
found
a
good
where
there
were
both
shelter
and
water
and
he
made
himself
a
camp
of
bark
which
he
called
in
the
language
of
his
tribe
a
willum
he
was
not
in
a
hurry
when
he
was
making
it
so
he
did
it
well
and
no
rain
could
possibly
come
through
it
one
side
of
it
was
a
big
rock
which
made
it
very
strong
so
that
no
wind
was
likely
to
blow
it
away
overhead
a
beautiful
clump
of
yellow
drooped
gracefully
not
that
warreen
cared
for
lilies
and
this
particular
clump
annoyed
him
for
the
rock
was
too
steep
for
him
to
climb
up
and
eat
the
he
had
been
living
there
for
some
time
very
lazy
and
contented
when
one
day
mirran
appeared
at
first
warreen
thought
he
meant
to
fight
and
that
also
annoyed
him
because
he
hated
fighting
but
mirran
soon
showed
him
that
he
only
wanted
to
be
friends
and
then
warreen
discovered
that
he
was
very
glad
to
have
some
one
with
whom
he
could
talk
so
after
the
manner
of
men
they
sat
down
and
yarned
all
day
several
times
during
the
day
mirran
said
i
must
be
going
but
warreen
always
answered
oh
do
go
yet
and
they
went
on
talking
harder
than
ever
night
came
and
mirran
said
it
is
really
time
i
made
a
move
warreen
said
why
not
stay
the
night
i
can
put
you
up
they
talked
it
over
for
a
while
and
then
it
was
quite
too
late
for
mirran
to
go
so
he
stayed
all
night
and
in
the
morning
warreen
said
why
not
spare
me
a
few
days
now
that
you
are
here
mirran
willingly
agreed
to
this
for
he
had
nothing
to
do
and
he
thought
it
very
nice
of
warreen
to
put
the
invitation
that
way
they
became
great
friends
mirran
was
tall
and
thin
and
sinewy
while
warreen
was
very
short
and
dumpy
and
exceedingly
fat
also
he
was
lazy
and
he
liked
having
some
one
to
help
him
get
food
at
which
mirran
was
very
quick
and
clever
mirran
also
was
the
last
of
his
tribe
the
others
had
been
killed
by
warlike
blacks
and
mirran
would
have
been
killed
also
but
that
he
managed
to
swim
across
a
river
and
get
away
into
the
scrub
he
was
very
active
and
fleet
of
foot
and
delighted
in
running
which
was
an
exercise
that
bored
warreen
very
badly
soon
they
made
an
arrangement
by
which
mirran
did
all
the
hunting
while
warreen
dug
for
yams
and
other
roots
and
prepared
the
food
just
as
a
woman
does
it
suited
them
both
very
well
mirran
had
one
peculiarity
that
warreen
at
first
thought
exceedingly
foolish
he
did
not
like
to
sleep
indoors
it
was
summer
time
when
he
came
and
he
would
not
build
himself
a
willum
but
slept
upon
a
soft
bed
of
grass
under
the
stars
if
a
cold
night
came
or
even
a
rainy
one
he
rolled
himself
in
his
rug
and
slept
just
as
happily
warreen
began
by
thinking
he
was
mad
but
as
time
went
on
he
often
slept
outside
with
mirran
himself
especially
on
those
nights
when
they
were
talking
very
hard
and
did
not
want
to
leave
off
warreen
used
to
grumble
at
the
hardness
of
the
ground
but
he
was
really
very
much
better
for
staying
outside
in
the
fresh
his
little
willum
was
a
very
stuffy
place
sometimes
he
would
think
about
the
winter
and
say
to
mirran
when
are
you
going
to
build
your
willum
oh
there
is
plenty
of
time
mirran
would
say
the
cold
weather
will
be
here
and
then
what
will
you
do
oh
i
expect
i
shall
have
my
camp
ready
in
time
it
will
not
take
me
long
to
build
it
when
the
time
comes
if
you
are
not
very
careful
you
will
find
yourself
caught
by
the
winter
and
you
will
not
like
that
said
warreen
but
mirran
only
laughed
and
talked
about
something
else
he
hated
building
and
was
anxious
to
put
it
off
as
long
as
possible
warreen
had
a
very
suspicious
mind
and
it
often
made
him
believe
very
stupid
things
he
was
the
kind
of
man
who
was
best
living
alone
because
so
often
he
got
foolish
ideas
into
his
head
about
other
people
and
imagined
he
had
cause
for
offence
when
there
was
really
none
at
all
so
he
began
to
wonder
why
mirran
would
not
build
a
camp
and
the
thought
came
to
him
that
perhaps
he
did
not
intend
to
build
at
all
but
meant
to
take
possession
of
his
own
willum
of
course
that
was
ridiculous
for
mirran
was
only
lazy
and
kept
saying
to
himself
i
will
build
and
when
came
he
would
say
oh
it
is
beautiful
weather
i
need
not
worry
about
building
for
a
few
days
yet
so
he
went
on
putting
it
off
and
warreen
went
on
being
suspicious
until
sometimes
he
felt
sorry
he
had
ever
asked
mirran
to
live
with
him
but
mirran
sang
and
joked
and
hunted
and
had
no
idea
that
warreen
was
making
himself
uneasy
by
such
stupid
thoughts
one
night
clouds
came
drifting
over
the
sky
after
a
hot
day
and
warreen
said
i
am
not
going
to
sleep
outside
i
do
think
it
will
rain
said
mirran
it
is
much
cooler
out
here
yes
but
one
soon
forgets
that
when
one
is
asleep
i
hate
getting
wet
said
warreen
well
just
as
you
like
mirran
answered
for
my
part
i
am
too
fond
of
the
stars
to
leave
them
so
he
spread
his
rug
in
a
soft
place
and
lay
down
in
a
few
minutes
he
was
fast
asleep
and
warreen
went
off
to
bed
feeling
rather
though
he
could
not
have
told
why
in
the
night
heavy
rain
came
and
the
air
grew
rapidly
very
cold
mirran
woke
up
grumbled
a
little
at
the
weather
rolled
himself
in
his
rug
and
crept
into
the
most
sheltered
corner
he
could
find
by
the
rock
not
liking
to
disturb
warreen
by
going
into
the
willum
it
was
too
cold
to
sleep
so
he
soon
uncovered
the
ashes
of
their
camp
fire
and
put
sticks
on
it
and
there
he
crouched
shivering
and
wishing
warreen
would
wake
up
and
invite
him
to
sleep
in
the
shelter
but
the
rain
came
more
and
more
heavily
and
a
keen
wind
arose
and
a
sudden
squall
put
out
mirran
fire
soon
little
channels
of
water
were
finding
their
way
in
every
direction
over
the
hard
ground
so
that
mirran
became
very
wet
and
then
he
noticed
a
red
glow
inside
the
willum
that
is
good
he
said
joyfully
warreen
is
awake
and
has
made
himself
a
fire
now
he
will
ask
me
to
go
and
lie
down
in
his
hut
he
crouched
close
by
the
rock
for
a
long
time
thinking
each
moment
that
warreen
would
ask
him
in
but
no
sound
came
and
after
a
while
he
came
to
the
conclusion
that
warreen
could
not
know
he
was
awake
so
he
got
up
and
went
over
to
the
door
of
the
willum
and
looked
in
the
little
fire
was
burning
redly
and
all
looked
very
cosy
and
inviting
to
poor
frozen
mirran
warreen
lay
near
the
fire
and
looked
at
him
suspiciously
ky
what
a
night
said
mirran
his
teeth
chattering
you
were
right
about
the
weather
warreen
and
i
was
wrong
i
have
been
very
sorry
for
the
last
hour
that
my
camp
is
not
built
may
i
come
in
and
sit
in
that
corner
there
was
not
much
vacant
space
in
warreen
little
willum
but
it
was
quite
big
enough
for
two
at
a
pinch
in
the
corner
to
which
mirran
pointed
there
was
nothing
but
warreen
looked
at
him
suspiciously
and
grunted
under
his
breath
i
want
that
corner
for
my
head
he
said
at
last
and
he
turned
over
and
laid
his
head
there
mirran
looked
rather
surprised
never
mind
this
place
will
do
he
said
pointing
to
another
corner
i
want
that
place
for
my
feet
warreen
said
and
he
moved
over
and
laid
his
feet
there
still
mirran
could
not
understand
that
his
friend
meant
to
be
so
churlish
well
this
place
will
suit
me
famously
he
said
pointing
to
where
warreen
feet
had
been
but
that
did
not
please
warreen
either
you
ca
have
that
place
i
may
want
it
later
on
he
said
with
a
snarl
and
he
turned
and
lay
down
between
the
fire
and
mirran
and
shut
his
eyes
then
mirran
realized
that
warreen
did
not
mean
him
to
have
any
warmth
or
shelter
and
he
lost
his
temper
he
rushed
outside
into
the
wet
darkness
and
stumbled
over
a
big
stone
that
was
not
a
lucky
stumble
for
warreen
for
all
that
mirran
wanted
at
the
moment
was
a
weapon
he
picked
up
the
stone
and
ran
back
into
the
willum
warreen
lay
by
the
fire
and
he
flung
the
stone
at
him
as
hard
as
he
could
it
hit
warreen
on
the
forehead
and
immediately
his
forehead
went
quite
flat
that
something
for
you
to
remember
me
by
said
mirran
angrily
you
can
keep
your
dark
little
hole
of
a
willum
and
live
in
it
always
just
as
you
can
keep
your
flat
forehead
i
have
done
with
you
he
turned
and
ran
out
of
the
hut
for
he
was
afraid
that
if
he
stayed
he
would
kill
warreen
behind
him
warreen
staggered
to
his
feet
and
caught
hold
of
his
spear
which
leaned
against
the
wall
near
the
doorway
he
did
not
make
any
reply
but
he
drove
the
spear
into
the
darkness
after
mirran
and
it
hit
him
in
the
back
and
hung
there
mirran
fell
down
without
a
word
the
light
from
the
fire
shone
on
him
as
he
lay
there
in
the
rain
with
the
spear
behind
him
warreen
laughed
a
little
holding
by
his
i
shall
have
a
flat
forehead
shall
i
he
said
well
you
will
have
more
than
that
where
that
spear
sticks
there
shall
it
stick
always
and
it
will
be
a
tail
for
you
you
will
never
run
or
jump
without
it
again
and
never
shall
you
have
a
willum
then
he
had
no
more
strength
left
so
he
crept
back
and
lay
beside
his
fire
while
mirran
lay
in
the
pouring
rain
no
one
saw
warreen
and
mirran
again
as
men
but
from
that
time
two
new
animals
came
into
the
bush
and
the
magpie
and
the
minah
those
two
inquisitive
birds
who
know
everything
soon
found
out
their
story
and
told
it
to
all
the
black
people
so
everybody
knows
that
warreen
the
wombat
and
mirran
the
kangaroo
were
once
men
and
lived
together
they
do
not
live
together
now
nor
do
they
like
each
other
the
wombat
is
fat
and
surly
and
lazy
and
he
lives
in
a
dark
hole
in
the
ground
his
forehead
is
flat
and
he
does
not
go
far
from
his
hole
and
he
is
no
more
fond
of
working
for
his
living
than
he
was
when
he
lived
in
a
willum
as
a
man
the
kangaroo
lives
in
the
free
open
places
and
races
through
the
bush
as
swiftly
as
mirran
used
to
race
long
ago
but
always
behind
him
he
carries
as
the
blacks
call
his
tail
and
it
has
grown
so
that
he
has
to
use
it
in
running
and
jumping
and
now
he
could
not
get
on
without
it
he
is
just
as
quick
and
gentle
as
ever
but
when
he
is
angry
he
can
fight
with
his
forepaws
just
as
a
man
fights
with
his
hands
other
animals
of
the
bush
have
holes
and
but
the
kangaroo
has
none
he
does
not
look
for
shelter
but
sleeps
in
the
open
air
it
is
difficult
to
see
him
for
when
he
is
eating
young
leaves
and
grass
his
skin
looks
just
the
same
colour
as
the
trees
and
you
are
sometimes
quite
close
to
him
before
his
bright
eyes
are
seen
watching
you
eagerly
then
he
turns
and
hops
away
faster
than
a
horse
can
gallop
in
great
bounds
that
carry
him
yards
at
every
stride
with
his
long
tail
thumping
the
ground
behind
him
he
has
learned
to
use
it
to
balance
on
it
and
make
it
help
him
in
those
immense
leaps
that
no
animal
in
the
bush
can
equal
so
warreen
did
not
do
him
so
bad
a
turn
as
he
hoped
when
he
threw
his
spear
at
him
that
rainy
night
long
ago
x
the
daughters
of
wonkawala
the
chief
wonkawala
was
a
powerful
man
who
ruled
over
a
big
tribe
they
were
a
fierce
and
warlike
people
always
ready
to
go
out
against
other
tribes
and
by
fighting
they
had
gained
a
great
quantity
of
property
and
roamed
unmolested
through
a
wide
tract
of
country
which
meant
that
all
the
tribe
was
wonkawala
had
not
always
been
a
chief
he
had
been
an
ordinary
warrior
but
he
was
fiercer
and
stronger
than
most
men
and
he
had
gradually
worked
his
way
up
to
power
and
leadership
there
were
many
jealous
of
him
who
would
have
been
glad
to
see
his
downfall
but
wonkawala
was
wary
as
well
as
brave
and
once
he
had
gained
his
position
he
kept
it
and
made
himself
stronger
and
stronger
he
had
several
wives
and
in
his
wurleys
were
fine
furs
and
splendid
weapons
and
abundance
of
grass
mats
every
one
feared
him
and
he
had
all
that
the
heart
of
a
black
chief
could
desire
except
for
one
thing
he
had
no
son
five
daughters
had
wonkawala
tall
and
beautiful
girls
skilled
in
all
women
work
and
full
of
high
courage
as
befits
the
daughters
of
a
chief
yillin
was
the
eldest
and
she
was
also
the
bravest
and
wisest
so
that
her
sisters
all
looked
up
to
her
and
obeyed
her
many
young
warriors
had
wished
to
marry
her
but
she
had
refused
them
all
time
enough
she
said
to
her
father
at
present
it
is
enough
for
me
to
be
the
daughter
of
wonkawala
her
father
was
rather
inclined
to
agree
with
her
he
knew
that
her
position
as
the
eldest
daughter
of
the
chief
without
brothers
was
a
fine
thing
and
that
once
she
married
she
would
live
in
a
wurley
much
like
any
other
woman
and
do
much
the
same
hard
work
and
have
much
the
same
hard
time
the
life
of
the
black
women
was
not
a
very
pleasant
one
it
was
no
wonder
that
they
so
soon
became
withered
and
bent
and
hideous
hard
work
the
care
of
many
babies
little
food
and
many
blows
these
were
the
portion
of
most
women
and
might
well
be
that
even
of
the
daughter
of
a
chief
when
once
she
left
her
wurley
for
that
of
a
young
warrior
so
wonkawala
who
was
unlike
many
blacks
in
being
very
fond
of
his
daughters
did
not
urge
that
yillin
should
get
married
and
the
suitors
had
to
go
disconsolately
away
but
there
came
a
time
when
wonkawala
fell
ill
and
for
many
weeks
he
lay
in
his
wurley
shivering
under
his
fur
rugs
and
becoming
weaker
and
weaker
the
tried
all
kinds
of
treatment
for
him
but
nothing
seemed
to
do
him
any
good
they
painted
him
in
strange
designs
and
cut
him
with
shell
knives
to
make
him
bleed
and
when
he
complained
of
pain
in
the
back
they
turned
him
on
his
face
and
stood
on
his
back
so
wonkawala
complained
no
more
but
the
back
was
no
better
after
the
sorcerers
had
tried
these
and
many
other
methods
of
healing
they
declared
that
some
one
had
bewitched
wonkawala
this
was
a
favourite
device
of
puzzled
sorcerers
they
had
made
the
tribes
believe
that
if
a
man
enemy
got
possession
of
anything
that
had
belonged
to
him
even
such
things
as
the
bones
of
an
animal
he
had
eaten
broken
weapons
scraps
of
furs
he
had
worn
or
in
fact
anything
he
had
touched
it
could
be
employed
as
a
charm
against
him
especially
to
produce
illness
this
made
the
blacks
careful
to
burn
up
all
rubbish
before
leaving
a
and
they
were
very
keen
in
finding
odd
scraps
of
property
that
had
belonged
to
an
unfriendly
tribe
anything
of
this
kind
that
they
found
was
given
to
the
chief
to
be
carefully
kept
as
a
means
of
injuring
the
enemy
a
fragment
of
this
description
was
called
a
wuulon
and
was
thought
to
have
great
power
as
a
charm
for
evil
should
one
of
the
tribe
wish
to
be
revenged
upon
an
enemy
he
borrowed
his
wuulon
from
the
chief
rubbed
it
with
a
mixture
of
red
clay
and
emu
fat
and
tied
it
to
the
end
of
a
which
he
stuck
upright
in
the
ground
before
the
then
all
the
blacks
sat
round
watching
it
but
at
some
distance
away
so
that
their
shadows
should
not
fall
upon
it
and
solemnly
chanted
imprecations
until
the
fell
to
the
ground
they
believed
that
it
would
fall
in
the
direction
of
the
enemy
to
whom
the
wuulon
belonged
and
immediately
they
all
threw
hot
ashes
in
the
same
direction
with
hissing
and
curses
and
prayers
that
and
disease
might
fall
upon
the
owner
the
sorcerers
tried
this
practice
with
every
wuulon
in
possession
but
whatever
effect
might
have
been
produced
on
the
owners
of
the
wuulons
wonkawala
himself
was
not
helped
at
all
he
grew
weaker
and
weaker
and
it
became
plain
that
he
must
die
the
knowledge
that
they
were
to
lose
their
chief
threw
all
the
blacks
into
mourning
and
weeping
so
that
the
noise
of
their
cries
was
heard
in
the
wurley
where
wonkawala
lay
but
besides
those
who
mourned
there
were
others
who
plotted
even
though
they
seemed
to
be
crying
as
loudly
as
the
rest
for
since
wonkawala
had
no
son
some
other
man
must
be
chosen
to
succeed
him
as
chief
and
there
were
at
least
half
a
dozen
who
thought
they
had
every
right
to
the
position
so
they
all
gathered
their
followings
together
collecting
as
many
supporters
as
each
could
muster
and
there
seemed
every
chance
of
a
very
pretty
fight
as
soon
as
wonkawala
should
breathe
his
last
the
dying
chief
was
well
aware
of
what
was
going
on
he
knew
that
they
must
fight
it
out
between
themselves
and
that
the
strongest
would
win
but
what
he
was
most
concerned
about
was
the
safety
of
his
daughters
their
fate
would
probably
be
anything
but
pleasant
once
left
without
him
they
would
be
no
longer
the
leading
girls
of
the
tribe
and
much
petty
spite
and
jealousy
would
probably
be
visited
upon
them
by
the
other
women
or
they
might
be
made
tools
in
the
fight
for
the
succession
to
his
position
and
mixed
up
in
the
feuds
and
disputes
which
would
ensue
indeed
it
might
easily
happen
that
they
would
be
killed
before
the
fighting
settled
down
in
any
case
it
seemed
to
wonkawala
that
hardship
and
danger
were
ahead
of
them
he
called
them
to
him
one
evening
and
made
them
kneel
down
so
close
that
they
could
hear
him
when
he
spoke
in
a
whisper
listen
he
said
i
am
dying
no
do
not
begin
wailing
now
there
will
be
time
enough
for
that
afterwards
my
day
is
done
and
it
has
been
a
good
day
i
have
been
a
strong
man
and
my
name
will
be
remembered
as
a
chief
what
can
a
man
want
more
but
you
are
women
and
my
heart
is
uneasy
about
you
nothing
will
matter
to
us
if
you
die
said
yillin
you
may
think
so
now
said
the
chief
looking
at
her
with
affection
in
his
fierce
eyes
but
my
death
may
well
be
the
least
of
the
bad
things
that
may
happen
to
you
you
will
be
as
slaves
where
you
have
been
as
princesses
even
if
i
am
in
the
sky
with
maker
of
men
i
shall
be
unhappy
to
see
that
therefore
it
seems
to
me
that
you
must
leave
the
tribe
leave
the
tribe
breathed
yillin
who
always
spoke
for
her
sisters
but
where
should
we
go
i
have
dreamed
that
you
shall
go
to
the
east
said
her
father
what
is
to
happen
to
you
i
do
not
know
but
you
must
go
you
may
fall
into
the
power
of
another
tribe
but
i
believe
they
would
be
kinder
to
you
than
your
own
would
be
for
there
will
be
much
fighting
here
after
i
have
gone
to
i
think
any
other
tribe
would
take
you
in
with
the
honour
that
is
due
to
a
chief
daughters
in
any
case
it
is
better
to
be
slaves
among
strangers
than
in
the
place
where
you
have
been
rulers
i
would
rather
die
than
be
a
slave
here
said
yillin
proudly
spoken
like
a
son
said
the
old
chief
nodding
approval
get
weapons
and
food
ready
secretly
all
that
you
can
carry
and
when
the
men
are
away
burying
me
make
your
escape
they
will
be
so
busy
in
quarrelling
that
they
will
not
notice
soon
that
you
have
gone
and
then
they
will
be
afraid
to
go
after
you
lest
any
should
get
the
upper
hand
during
their
absence
go
to
the
east
and
will
decide
your
fate
now
i
am
weary
and
i
wish
to
sleep
so
yillin
and
her
sisters
obeyed
and
during
the
next
few
days
they
hid
weapons
in
a
secret
place
outside
the
camp
and
crammed
their
with
food
charms
and
all
the
things
they
could
carry
already
they
could
see
that
there
was
wisdom
in
their
father
advice
there
was
much
talk
that
ceased
suddenly
when
they
came
near
and
the
women
used
to
whisper
together
looking
at
them
and
bursting
into
rude
laughter
yillin
and
her
sisters
held
their
heads
high
but
there
was
fierce
anger
in
their
hearts
for
but
a
week
back
no
one
would
have
dared
to
show
them
any
disrespect
at
last
one
evening
wonkawala
died
and
the
whole
tribe
mourned
for
him
for
days
there
was
weeping
and
wailing
and
all
the
time
the
chief
daughters
remained
within
their
wurley
seeing
no
one
but
the
women
who
brought
them
food
as
the
time
went
on
the
manner
of
these
women
became
more
and
more
curt
and
the
food
they
brought
less
excellent
until
on
the
last
day
of
mourning
yillin
and
her
sisters
were
given
worse
meals
than
they
had
ever
eaten
before
our
father
spoke
truth
said
yillin
it
is
time
we
fled
time
indeed
said
peeka
the
youngest
sister
did
you
see
sneering
face
as
she
threw
this
evil
food
in
to
us
i
would
that
wonkawala
our
father
could
have
come
to
life
again
to
see
it
said
yillin
with
an
angry
sob
he
would
have
withered
her
with
his
fury
but
our
day
like
his
is
done
in
our
own
tribe
never
mind
we
shall
find
luck
elsewhere
after
noon
of
that
day
the
men
of
the
tribe
bore
the
body
of
wonkawala
away
to
bury
it
with
honour
the
women
stayed
behind
wailing
loudly
as
long
as
the
men
were
in
sight
but
as
soon
as
the
trees
hid
them
from
view
they
ceased
to
cry
out
and
began
to
laugh
and
eat
and
enjoy
themselves
they
fell
silent
presently
as
the
five
daughters
of
wonkawala
came
out
of
their
wurley
and
walked
slowly
across
the
camp
they
were
muffled
in
their
scarcely
showing
their
faces
for
a
moment
there
was
silence
and
then
one
of
the
women
said
something
to
another
at
which
both
burst
into
a
cackle
of
laughter
then
another
called
to
the
five
sisters
in
a
familiar
and
insolent
manner
where
do
you
go
girls
we
go
to
mourn
for
our
father
in
a
quiet
place
answered
yillin
haughtily
oh
then
the
camp
is
not
good
enough
for
you
to
mourn
in
cried
the
woman
with
a
sneer
but
do
not
be
away
too
long
there
will
be
plenty
of
work
to
do
for
you
now
remember
you
are
no
longer
our
mistresses
no
it
is
your
turn
to
serve
us
now
cried
another
bring
me
back
some
yams
when
you
come
then
perhaps
there
will
not
be
so
many
beatings
for
you
there
was
a
yell
of
laughter
from
all
the
women
amidst
which
yillin
and
her
sisters
marched
out
of
the
camp
with
disdainful
glances
when
they
drew
near
their
they
kept
careful
watch
in
case
anyone
had
followed
them
as
a
matter
of
fact
all
the
women
were
by
that
time
busily
engaged
in
ransacking
their
wurley
and
dividing
among
them
the
possessions
the
sisters
had
not
been
able
to
carry
away
so
that
they
were
quite
safe
they
collected
their
weapons
and
hurried
off
into
the
forest
they
had
obeyed
their
father
and
gone
east
and
the
was
west
of
the
camp
so
they
met
nobody
and
their
flight
was
not
discovered
that
night
the
men
came
back
to
the
camp
in
the
evening
hungry
and
full
of
eagerness
about
the
fight
for
the
leadership
of
the
tribe
and
the
women
were
kept
busy
in
looking
after
them
the
first
fight
took
place
that
very
evening
and
though
it
was
not
a
very
big
one
it
left
no
time
for
anyone
to
wonder
what
had
become
of
the
five
sisters
not
until
next
day
did
the
tribe
realize
that
they
had
run
away
and
then
as
wonkawala
had
foreseen
no
one
wanted
to
run
after
them
certain
young
warriors
who
had
thought
of
marrying
them
were
annoyed
but
they
could
only
promise
themselves
to
pursue
and
capture
them
when
the
tribe
should
again
have
settled
down
under
new
leadership
the
five
sisters
were
very
sad
when
they
started
on
their
journey
for
the
bush
is
a
wide
and
lonely
place
for
women
and
there
seemed
nothing
ahead
of
them
but
difficulty
and
danger
they
wept
as
they
hurried
through
the
forest
nor
did
they
dare
to
sleep
for
a
long
time
only
when
they
were
so
weary
that
they
could
scarcely
drag
themselves
along
did
they
fling
themselves
down
in
a
grassy
hollow
where
tall
ferns
made
a
screen
from
any
prying
eyes
and
a
stream
of
water
gave
them
refreshment
they
slept
soundly
and
dreamed
gentle
dreams
and
when
they
awoke
in
the
morning
it
seemed
that
a
great
weight
had
been
lifted
from
their
hearts
i
feel
so
happy
sisters
said
yillin
sitting
up
and
rubbing
her
eyes
our
father
came
to
me
in
my
sleep
and
told
me
to
be
of
good
courage
and
to
smile
instead
of
weeping
he
came
to
me
also
said
peeka
and
told
me
there
was
good
luck
ahead
after
all
said
another
of
the
girls
what
have
we
to
fret
about
it
is
a
fine
thing
to
go
out
and
see
the
world
i
am
certain
that
we
are
going
to
enjoy
ourselves
it
will
be
interesting
at
any
rate
said
yillin
but
we
must
hurry
onward
for
we
are
not
yet
safe
from
pursuit
though
i
do
not
think
it
will
come
they
made
as
much
haste
as
possible
for
the
next
few
days
until
it
seemed
certain
that
no
one
was
tracking
them
down
and
with
each
dawn
they
felt
happier
and
more
free
from
care
they
were
lucky
in
finding
game
so
that
they
were
and
on
the
fifth
day
they
came
upon
trees
loaded
with
mulga
apples
which
gave
them
a
great
feast
they
roasted
many
of
the
apples
and
carried
them
with
them
in
their
sometimes
they
came
to
little
creeks
fringed
with
maidenhair
fern
where
they
bathed
sometimes
they
passed
over
great
rolling
plains
where
they
could
see
for
miles
and
where
kangaroos
were
feeding
in
little
mobs
dotted
here
and
there
on
the
they
loved
flocks
of
white
cockatoos
flew
screaming
overhead
and
sometimes
they
saw
the
beautiful
pink
and
grey
galahs
wheeling
aloft
the
sunlight
gleaming
on
their
grey
backs
and
crests
then
they
went
across
a
little
range
of
hills
where
the
trees
were
covered
with
flocks
of
parrots
and
the
lorikeets
flew
screeching
sometimes
alighting
like
a
flock
of
great
butterflies
on
a
to
hang
head
downwards
among
the
leaves
licking
the
sweet
eucalyptus
honey
from
the
flowers
with
their
tongues
sometimes
when
they
had
lain
very
quietly
through
a
hot
hour
they
saw
the
lyre
bird
the
shyest
bird
of
all
the
bush
dancing
on
the
great
mound
twenty
or
thirty
feet
high
which
it
builds
for
its
nest
mocking
as
it
danced
the
cries
of
half
the
birds
in
the
country
and
waving
its
beautiful
tail
the
magpie
woke
them
in
the
dawn
with
its
rich
gurgling
notes
the
beautiful
hopped
near
them
proud
of
his
exquisite
plumage
of
black
and
bright
blue
chirping
his
happy
little
song
they
passed
swamps
where
cranes
and
herons
fished
stalking
in
the
shallows
or
flew
lazily
away
with
dangling
legs
and
sometimes
they
heard
the
booming
of
the
bittern
which
made
them
very
much
afraid
at
evening
they
would
hear
a
harsh
clanging
cry
and
looking
up
they
would
see
a
long
line
of
black
swans
flying
into
the
sunset
there
were
other
birds
too
more
than
any
white
boy
or
girl
will
ever
know
about
for
these
were
the
old
days
of
australia
long
before
the
white
men
had
come
to
settle
the
country
and
destroy
the
bush
with
their
axes
but
there
were
no
rabbits
and
no
thistles
for
australia
was
free
from
them
until
the
white
men
came
gradually
the
daughters
of
wonkawala
lost
all
fear
they
were
perfectly
happy
and
the
bush
no
longer
seemed
lonely
to
them
they
had
enough
to
eat
they
were
warm
at
night
and
so
strong
and
active
and
so
skilled
in
the
use
of
weapons
had
their
woodland
life
made
them
that
they
did
not
seem
to
mind
whether
they
met
enemies
or
not
they
often
danced
as
they
went
on
their
way
and
made
all
the
echoes
of
the
forest
ring
with
their
songs
at
last
one
day
they
found
their
way
barred
by
a
wide
river
which
flowed
from
north
to
south
they
could
of
course
all
swim
but
it
was
not
easy
to
see
how
to
get
their
furs
across
they
were
talking
about
it
wondering
whether
they
could
make
a
canoe
or
a
raft
when
they
heard
a
friendly
hail
and
looking
across
they
saw
five
girls
standing
on
the
opposite
bank
who
are
you
shouted
the
strangers
we
are
the
daughters
of
wonkawala
they
cried
who
are
you
we
are
girls
of
the
wapiya
tribe
out
looking
for
adventures
why
so
are
we
and
we
have
found
many
they
shouted
questions
and
answers
backwards
and
forwards
until
they
began
to
feel
acquainted
what
do
you
eat
what
furs
have
you
what
songs
do
you
sing
that
led
to
singing
and
they
sang
all
their
favourite
songs
to
each
other
beating
two
boomerangs
together
as
an
accompaniment
when
they
had
finished
they
felt
a
great
desire
to
travel
together
it
is
really
a
great
pity
that
the
river
flows
between
us
cried
the
daughters
of
wonkawala
how
can
we
join
you
the
wapiya
girls
laughed
that
is
quite
easy
they
answered
this
is
a
magic
river
and
when
once
your
feet
have
touched
it
you
will
be
magic
too
dance
straight
across
you
are
making
fun
of
us
cried
yillin
no
indeed
we
are
not
we
can
not
cross
to
you
for
on
your
side
there
is
no
magic
but
if
you
will
trust
us
and
dance
across
you
will
find
that
you
will
not
sink
this
was
hard
to
believe
and
the
sisters
looked
at
each
other
doubtfully
then
yillin
took
off
her
rug
and
handed
it
to
peeka
it
will
be
easy
enough
to
try
and
at
the
worst
i
can
only
get
a
wetting
she
said
follow
me
if
i
do
not
sink
she
went
down
to
the
water
and
danced
out
upon
its
surface
it
did
not
yield
beneath
her
the
surface
seemed
to
swing
and
heave
as
though
it
were
elastic
but
it
supported
her
and
she
danced
across
with
long
sliding
steps
behind
her
came
her
sisters
and
so
delightful
was
it
to
dance
on
the
swinging
that
they
burst
into
singing
and
so
came
with
music
and
laughter
to
the
other
side
the
wapiya
girls
met
them
with
open
arms
ky
you
are
brave
enough
to
join
us
they
cried
now
we
can
all
go
in
quest
of
adventure
together
and
who
knows
what
wonderful
things
may
befall
us
so
they
told
each
other
all
their
histories
and
they
held
a
feast
and
after
they
had
all
eaten
they
danced
off
to
the
east
together
for
they
were
all
so
happy
that
their
feet
refused
to
walk
sedately
presently
they
came
to
an
open
space
where
were
many
tiny
hillocks
this
is
the
place
of
ants
said
the
wapiya
girls
here
we
have
often
come
before
to
gather
ants
eggs
dearly
do
we
love
ants
eggs
said
little
peeka
licking
her
lips
and
these
are
very
good
eggs
said
the
eldest
of
the
wapiya
girls
whose
name
was
nullor
but
the
ants
defend
them
well
and
those
who
take
them
must
make
up
their
minds
to
be
bitten
ants
eggs
are
worth
a
few
bites
certainly
they
are
now
let
us
see
if
you
are
really
as
brave
as
you
say
they
attacked
the
hillocks
with
their
and
unearthed
great
stores
of
plump
eggs
which
they
eagerly
gathered
but
they
also
unearthed
numbers
of
huge
ants
of
a
glossy
dark
green
colour
and
these
defended
their
eggs
bravely
springing
at
the
girls
and
biting
them
whenever
they
could
ky
said
yillin
shaking
one
off
her
arm
it
is
as
well
that
these
eggs
are
so
very
good
for
the
bites
are
certainly
very
bad
we
have
no
ants
like
these
in
our
country
have
you
had
enough
asked
nullor
laughing
enough
bites
yes
but
not
enough
eggs
said
yillin
laughing
as
well
the
eggs
are
worth
the
pain
she
thrust
her
into
a
hillock
so
energetically
that
she
scattered
earth
and
eggs
and
ants
in
all
directions
and
one
ant
landed
on
nullor
nose
and
bit
it
severely
whereat
nullor
uttered
a
startled
yell
of
pain
and
the
daughters
of
wonkawala
laughed
very
much
who
is
brave
now
cried
little
peeka
nullor
rubbed
her
nose
with
a
lump
of
wet
earth
which
as
she
was
black
did
not
have
such
a
curious
effect
as
it
would
have
had
on
you
i
was
taken
by
surprise
she
said
somewhat
shamefacedly
and
indeed
my
nose
is
not
used
to
such
treatment
for
i
do
not
usually
poke
it
into
ants
nests
they
ate
all
the
eggs
and
rubbed
their
bites
with
chewed
leaves
which
soon
took
away
the
stings
and
then
they
danced
away
together
after
a
time
yillin
saw
an
eagle
flying
low
carrying
something
in
its
talons
she
flung
a
boomerang
at
it
and
so
well
did
she
aim
that
she
broke
its
neck
and
the
great
bird
came
fluttering
down
it
fell
into
a
pool
of
water
and
yillin
jumped
in
to
rescue
its
prey
for
she
could
see
that
it
was
alive
it
turned
out
to
be
a
dingo
a
fine
young
dog
which
was
too
bewildered
between
flying
and
drowning
to
make
any
objection
to
being
captured
yillin
secured
it
with
a
string
which
she
plaited
of
her
own
hair
and
as
much
of
peeka
as
peeka
was
willing
to
part
with
and
fed
it
with
bits
of
wallaby
and
the
dog
soon
became
friendly
and
licked
her
hand
he
is
a
lovely
dog
she
said
and
i
will
always
keep
him
i
will
call
him
dulderana
i
think
he
will
be
rather
a
nuisance
said
nullor
anyway
he
will
soon
leave
you
and
go
back
into
the
bush
i
do
not
think
he
will
yillin
said
well
you
can
not
teach
him
to
dance
or
sing
said
nullor
laughing
so
he
will
have
to
run
behind
us
of
course
he
will
and
he
will
be
very
useful
in
hunting
said
yillin
we
should
not
have
lost
that
yesterday
if
we
had
had
a
dog
dulderana
very
soon
made
himself
at
home
and
became
great
friends
with
all
the
girls
it
amused
him
very
much
when
they
danced
and
though
he
could
not
dance
himself
he
used
to
caper
wildly
round
them
uttering
short
sharp
barks
of
delight
but
their
singing
he
did
not
like
at
all
and
when
they
began
he
used
to
sit
down
with
his
nose
pointing
skywards
and
howl
most
dismally
until
the
girls
could
not
sing
for
laughing
then
they
would
pelt
bits
of
stick
at
him
until
he
was
sorry
by
degrees
he
learned
to
endure
the
singing
in
silence
but
he
never
pretended
to
enjoy
it
one
day
as
they
went
along
they
saw
in
the
far
distance
a
silvery
gleam
what
is
that
asked
yillin
it
looks
like
the
duntyi
or
silver
bush
said
the
wapiya
girls
doubtfully
that
does
not
grow
in
our
country
said
yillin
let
us
go
and
look
at
it
but
when
they
drew
near
they
saw
that
it
was
not
a
bush
at
all
instead
it
was
a
man
a
very
old
man
he
had
no
hair
on
his
head
but
his
great
silver
beard
hung
straggling
to
his
knees
and
when
the
breeze
blew
it
about
it
was
so
large
that
it
was
no
wonder
they
had
mistaken
it
for
a
bush
no
word
did
he
speak
but
he
sat
and
looked
at
them
in
silence
and
when
they
greeted
him
respectfully
he
only
nodded
something
about
him
made
them
feel
afraid
they
clustered
together
looking
at
him
at
last
he
spoke
i
have
come
too
soon
he
said
you
are
not
ready
for
me
yet
go
on
at
that
dulderana
howled
very
dismally
indeed
and
rushed
away
with
his
tail
between
his
legs
the
girls
quite
understood
how
he
felt
and
they
also
ran
away
never
stopping
until
they
were
far
from
the
strange
old
man
now
who
was
that
yillin
said
nullor
looked
uneasy
i
do
not
know
she
said
this
is
a
strange
country
and
there
is
much
magic
in
it
we
will
hurry
on
or
he
may
perhaps
come
after
us
so
they
hastened
on
into
the
forest
forgetting
for
a
while
to
dance
but
then
their
fear
left
them
and
again
their
songs
rang
through
the
bush
they
passed
a
clump
of
black
wattle
the
trunks
of
which
were
covered
with
gum
in
great
shining
masses
so
that
they
had
a
splendid
feast
for
the
gum
was
both
food
and
drink
and
what
they
could
not
eat
they
mixed
with
water
and
drank
enjoying
its
sweet
flavour
with
their
bags
filled
with
gum
they
went
on
and
one
evening
they
camped
among
a
grove
of
banksia
trees
near
a
pool
of
quiet
water
it
was
not
very
good
water
to
drink
but
the
wapiya
girls
showed
the
five
sisters
how
to
suck
it
up
through
banksia
cones
which
strained
out
any
impurities
and
gave
it
a
very
pleasant
taste
they
were
tired
and
lay
down
early
in
the
night
a
great
wind
sprang
up
and
with
it
came
a
curious
booming
noise
it
woke
the
daughters
of
wonkawala
and
they
sat
up
in
alarm
ky
that
must
be
a
huge
bittern
said
peeka
it
is
not
like
a
bittern
yillin
said
i
have
never
heard
any
sound
like
it
perhaps
it
is
the
bunyip
of
whom
our
mother
used
to
tell
us
when
we
were
little
a
terrible
beast
who
lives
in
swamps
and
whose
voice
fills
every
one
with
terror
the
wapiya
girls
woke
up
and
they
also
listened
then
they
laughed
among
themselves
but
they
did
not
let
the
sisters
see
that
they
were
laughing
they
seemed
to
think
little
of
the
noise
it
is
only
the
wind
howling
they
said
lie
down
and
sleep
you
five
inlanders
what
do
you
mean
by
that
demanded
yillin
but
the
wapiya
girls
only
giggled
again
and
lay
down
declaring
that
no
bunyip
was
going
to
spoil
their
sleep
and
as
they
were
so
cheerful
the
sisters
came
to
the
conclusion
that
they
might
as
well
do
the
same
when
they
awoke
it
was
day
and
the
booming
was
still
going
on
and
the
wind
felt
fresh
and
wet
the
wapiya
girls
were
already
up
and
they
greeted
them
with
laughter
we
have
a
surprise
for
you
said
they
shut
your
eyes
and
let
us
lead
you
the
sisters
did
so
and
felt
themselves
led
forward
presently
the
earth
became
soft
and
yielding
under
their
feet
and
they
cried
out
in
alarm
but
the
others
laughed
again
and
said
never
mind
you
are
quite
safe
in
a
moment
more
they
said
now
open
your
eyes
the
sisters
did
so
and
lo
they
stood
before
a
great
sheet
of
water
with
high
tumbling
waves
blue
and
sparkling
was
the
water
and
the
big
waves
came
rolling
in
gathering
themselves
up
slowly
with
their
tops
a
mass
of
foam
which
slowly
rose
and
curled
over
until
it
plunged
down
crashing
in
a
smother
of
breaking
bubbles
the
daughters
of
wonkawala
had
never
seen
anything
like
it
before
and
they
gasped
in
amazement
ky
what
a
river
they
cried
where
is
the
other
side
the
wapiya
girls
shouted
with
laughter
the
other
side
they
gasped
when
they
could
speak
why
there
is
no
other
side
this
is
the
sea
and
it
is
the
end
of
all
things
have
you
never
heard
of
it
is
the
sea
the
five
sisters
stared
we
have
heard
stories
of
it
from
the
old
men
and
women
but
we
never
imagined
that
it
was
like
this
no
one
could
imagine
it
without
seeing
it
have
you
known
it
before
oh
yes
we
have
often
camped
here
with
our
tribe
come
nearer
they
took
the
sisters
down
to
the
edge
of
the
water
and
presently
a
great
wave
rolled
in
broke
in
a
thunderous
roar
and
came
dashing
up
the
sand
the
sisters
stared
at
it
in
amazed
admiration
at
first
and
then
as
it
came
nearer
fear
fell
upon
them
and
they
screamed
and
turned
to
fly
they
ran
as
fast
as
they
could
in
the
yielding
sand
but
the
wave
came
faster
and
the
water
caught
them
at
first
round
their
ankles
and
then
swiftly
mounting
to
their
knees
then
it
went
back
and
the
sisters
thought
that
they
were
slipping
back
with
it
and
screamed
louder
than
ever
the
wapiya
girls
themselves
weak
with
laughter
caught
hold
of
them
the
sea
screamed
the
sisters
the
sea
is
carrying
us
away
the
others
led
them
up
on
higher
sand
and
laughed
at
them
until
they
began
to
laugh
at
themselves
never
before
have
i
seen
water
that
runs
backwards
and
forwards
as
though
a
great
giant
were
shaking
it
in
a
bowl
said
yillin
we
are
sorry
to
have
been
afraid
but
it
is
all
very
peculiar
and
unexpected
are
you
sure
it
is
not
magic
i
do
not
think
anyone
can
be
sure
of
that
about
the
sea
said
nullor
it
is
strange
water
and
indeed
i
often
think
that
it
is
very
great
magic
indeed
but
if
it
is
it
is
a
good
magic
and
we
are
not
afraid
of
it
and
this
queer
yellow
earth
that
slips
away
under
the
feet
is
that
magic
too
oh
the
sand
perhaps
it
is
who
knows
but
it
will
not
hurt
you
come
on
let
us
bathe
in
the
sea
for
that
is
one
of
the
most
beautiful
things
in
the
world
the
daughters
of
wonkawala
hung
back
at
first
for
they
were
very
doubtful
of
trusting
themselves
to
the
magic
water
but
the
others
laughed
and
persuaded
them
and
they
ventured
in
paddling
at
first
until
they
became
used
to
the
rushing
breakers
but
soon
they
gained
confidence
and
before
long
not
even
the
wapiya
were
bolder
than
they
and
they
would
dive
into
a
breaker
and
be
carried
in
on
its
curling
top
laughing
and
playing
like
so
many
mermaids
so
that
the
wapiya
girls
soon
lost
any
feeling
of
superiority
and
only
regained
it
once
when
peeka
feeling
thirsty
scooped
up
some
of
a
passing
wave
in
her
cupped
hands
and
took
a
deep
draught
for
the
next
two
minutes
peeka
was
coughing
and
spluttering
and
spitting
while
the
other
girls
yelled
with
laughter
that
is
certainly
very
bad
magic
said
peeka
angrily
when
she
could
speak
what
has
made
the
water
turn
bad
that
set
the
wapiya
girls
off
into
fresh
peals
of
mirth
and
it
was
some
time
before
they
could
explain
that
the
water
was
always
salt
peeka
was
annoyed
but
presently
she
laughed
too
oh
well
if
that
is
the
worst
of
its
magic
there
is
not
much
to
grumble
at
she
said
come
on
girls
let
us
dive
into
this
next
one
and
the
next
moment
peeka
merry
black
face
was
half
hidden
in
the
flying
spray
as
the
breaker
bore
her
ashore
they
stayed
by
the
sea
for
some
days
for
the
inland
girls
were
too
fascinated
to
leave
it
and
when
they
were
not
bathing
in
it
they
were
wandering
along
the
shore
wildly
excited
over
finding
shells
and
seaweed
and
all
the
other
treasures
of
the
sands
then
one
day
a
great
black
cloud
came
up
obscuring
all
the
sky
and
instead
of
being
sparkling
blue
and
silver
the
water
turned
to
a
dull
grey
and
looked
dead
and
oily
the
other
girls
were
afraid
of
it
and
would
not
go
into
the
cold
dark
breakers
but
yillin
who
loved
bathing
more
than
any
of
them
would
not
be
persuaded
and
plunged
in
for
a
swim
she
did
not
stay
long
for
the
water
felt
more
and
more
uncomfortable
each
moment
so
she
let
a
big
sullen
breaker
carry
her
in
and
wading
out
ran
up
the
beach
to
the
other
girls
they
started
back
when
they
saw
her
looking
at
her
with
amazement
and
fear
what
have
you
done
to
yourself
cried
nullor
i
nothing
what
are
you
looking
at
nullor
pointed
a
shaking
forefinger
at
her
body
and
looking
down
yillin
uttered
a
bewildered
cry
no
longer
was
she
and
black
her
body
and
legs
were
thickly
covered
with
shining
scales
so
that
she
gleamed
like
silver
illustration
her
body
and
legs
were
thickly
covered
with
shining
scales
so
that
she
gleamed
like
silver
it
is
the
water
she
stammered
it
must
be
does
it
feel
pleasant
inquired
nullor
it
looks
quite
beautiful
i
do
not
feel
anything
at
all
yillin
answered
but
it
certainly
does
look
well
she
gazed
at
her
shining
self
with
interest
and
turned
round
so
that
the
others
might
see
if
her
back
were
similarly
ornamented
it
was
and
the
other
girls
grew
a
little
jealous
jump
in
and
see
if
the
magic
will
come
upon
you
too
cried
yillin
they
did
not
lose
a
moment
flinging
their
fur
aprons
from
them
they
rushed
down
the
beach
and
plunged
into
the
dark
waves
and
lo
when
they
emerged
they
too
were
covered
with
silver
scales
they
stood
together
on
the
sand
a
shining
company
let
us
walk
along
the
shore
and
see
what
else
will
befall
us
said
yillin
they
gathered
up
their
property
and
set
off
eastwards
again
the
shore
curved
out
after
a
time
forming
a
rocky
cape
they
rounded
this
and
found
themselves
on
the
coast
of
a
little
bay
round
which
they
hurried
anxious
to
explore
some
great
rocks
at
the
farther
point
but
when
they
reached
them
they
found
their
way
barred
the
rocks
were
a
solid
wall
a
great
black
cliff
that
rose
sheer
from
the
water
running
far
out
beyond
even
the
farthest
line
of
the
breakers
nowhere
was
there
any
way
of
advancing
the
bay
was
ringed
with
the
dark
smooth
cliffs
the
little
dog
dulderana
whimpered
as
if
in
fear
let
us
go
back
said
the
wapiya
girls
this
is
not
a
good
place
for
a
moment
the
daughters
of
wonkawala
were
inclined
to
agree
then
there
came
to
them
suddenly
the
vision
of
their
father
who
had
said
go
to
the
east
and
they
knew
they
must
obey
we
are
not
afraid
they
said
go
you
back
if
you
wish
we
do
not
wish
to
leave
you
the
wapiya
said
sadly
nor
do
we
wish
to
lose
you
for
we
have
loved
you
very
much
said
the
sisters
but
we
must
go
forward
will
you
not
come
the
wapiya
girls
shook
their
heads
no
they
said
something
tells
us
that
we
must
return
and
never
see
you
more
but
we
will
always
watch
for
you
and
perhaps
some
day
we
may
hear
you
coming
singing
our
old
songs
and
we
will
run
to
meet
you
they
embraced
each
other
weeping
and
slowly
the
wapiya
girls
went
back
until
the
rocky
promontory
hid
them
from
sight
then
yillin
dashed
her
tears
away
come
my
sisters
she
cried
they
took
hands
and
danced
together
towards
the
wall
of
rock
that
loomed
before
them
black
unbroken
forbidding
yillin
was
at
the
end
and
as
she
reached
the
rock
she
raised
her
wona
or
and
struck
the
rock
it
split
open
and
they
danced
through
the
cleft
before
them
was
no
more
the
sea
but
a
green
country
dotted
with
trees
and
covered
with
thick
grass
a
little
way
from
them
was
a
low
mound
towards
which
they
danced
as
they
drew
near
they
saw
that
some
one
was
sitting
on
it
a
very
old
man
whose
silver
beard
swept
below
his
feet
he
sat
motionless
save
that
his
hands
were
always
busy
pulling
the
long
silver
hairs
from
his
beard
and
twisting
them
into
a
cord
it
is
the
old
man
we
met
long
ago
whispered
the
sisters
somehow
the
fear
that
they
had
felt
when
they
met
him
with
the
wapiya
girls
was
upon
them
no
longer
and
the
little
dog
dulderana
who
had
fled
from
him
howling
now
ran
up
to
him
gaily
frisking
round
him
the
old
man
put
out
his
hand
and
fondled
him
and
dulderana
snuggled
against
him
then
nestling
down
with
his
head
on
his
he
looked
at
yillin
as
if
to
say
this
is
my
master
yillin
understood
the
look
in
his
eyes
do
you
like
him
master
she
asked
we
bring
him
to
you
as
a
gift
that
is
a
good
gift
said
the
old
man
looking
much
pleased
and
you
are
welcome
my
children
i
think
that
this
time
i
have
not
met
you
too
soon
are
you
weary
with
all
your
wanderings
no
we
are
never
weary
said
yillin
we
have
danced
and
hunted
and
bathed
and
sung
and
we
have
forgotten
all
our
sorrows
our
father
wonkawala
bade
us
come
east
and
we
obeyed
him
and
so
you
found
friends
and
happiness
said
the
old
man
sit
down
and
tell
me
of
all
that
you
have
seen
they
sat
down
in
a
before
him
and
speaking
one
after
another
they
told
him
the
story
of
their
long
journey
he
heard
them
in
silence
nodding
now
and
then
and
all
the
time
his
fingers
moved
ceaselessly
plaiting
the
silver
hairs
into
a
long
cord
it
lay
in
great
shining
coils
at
his
feet
the
little
dog
nestled
beside
him
and
sometimes
when
he
paused
to
adjust
a
fresh
coil
his
fingers
rested
for
a
moment
on
its
head
he
smiled
at
the
sisters
when
they
had
finished
their
story
it
was
indeed
a
great
journey
and
the
sea
has
clothed
you
in
silver
so
that
you
are
more
glorious
than
any
chief
daughters
have
ever
been
before
he
said
and
now
comes
the
greatest
adventure
of
all
he
rose
as
he
spoke
pointing
to
the
sky
the
sisters
looked
up
and
cried
out
in
awe
for
as
they
looked
the
clouds
parted
and
they
saw
behind
them
arawotya
who
lives
in
the
sky
a
great
and
gentle
being
whose
face
seemed
to
have
light
behind
it
he
looked
down
at
them
kindly
and
beckoned
then
he
began
to
lower
a
long
cord
made
like
that
of
the
old
man
of
plaited
hair
it
reached
almost
to
the
top
of
the
mound
where
they
stood
you
are
to
go
up
said
the
old
man
you
first
i
last
of
all
but
first
we
will
send
up
the
little
dog
that
you
may
see
how
safe
it
is
he
took
his
silver
cord
and
tied
it
round
the
body
of
dulderana
then
joining
it
to
the
magic
cord
from
the
sky
then
arawotya
pulled
it
up
so
gently
that
the
little
dog
never
seemed
frightened
and
he
disappeared
behind
a
cloud
presently
the
cord
came
back
again
and
one
after
another
the
old
man
tied
the
girls
with
it
and
arawotya
drew
them
up
to
himself
yillin
was
the
last
of
the
sisters
to
go
but
as
she
was
being
pulled
up
she
cut
her
hand
with
her
and
her
pirha
or
fell
it
was
a
very
beautiful
carved
pirha
and
because
it
had
been
her
father
yillin
felt
very
sad
even
when
arawotya
had
gently
received
her
and
untying
the
cord
placed
her
by
her
sisters
she
peered
over
the
edge
of
the
cloud
trying
to
see
where
it
had
fallen
the
old
man
was
being
drawn
up
and
just
as
he
reached
the
clouds
yillin
caught
sight
of
her
pirha
lying
on
the
mound
see
she
whispered
to
peeka
my
pirha
it
lies
below
i
will
just
slide
down
the
cord
and
get
it
for
it
belonged
to
our
father
wonkawala
arawotya
will
forgive
me
and
pull
me
up
again
she
slid
hurriedly
down
the
cord
and
joyfully
seized
the
bowl
but
when
she
turned
to
climb
up
again
she
uttered
a
cry
of
despair
for
the
cord
was
out
of
her
reach
arawotya
had
drawn
it
up
as
she
looked
it
disappeared
and
then
the
swept
together
blotting
out
everything
above
she
was
alone
all
that
day
and
night
yillin
lay
on
the
mound
weeping
and
begging
arawotya
to
forgive
her
and
take
her
up
to
her
sisters
but
all
the
clouds
had
gone
and
there
was
only
a
clear
blue
sky
bright
with
moonlight
and
dotted
with
a
million
stars
and
there
was
no
sign
of
those
whom
she
had
lost
she
gave
herself
up
to
despair
yakai
she
moaned
better
that
i
had
remained
a
slave
in
the
camp
of
wonkawala
than
have
come
to
this
lonely
land
to
die
towards
morning
exhausted
she
fell
into
a
troubled
sleep
and
in
her
sleep
her
father
came
to
her
and
his
face
was
grave
and
kind
alas
my
daughter
he
said
you
have
lost
your
chance
of
happiness
for
the
sake
of
a
worthless
pirha
what
did
you
imagine
that
you
would
need
a
pirha
in
the
sky
no
but
because
it
was
yours
my
father
she
sobbed
in
her
sleep
wonkawala
face
shone
with
a
great
light
always
you
were
my
dear
and
faithful
daughter
he
said
because
of
that
there
is
yet
happiness
for
you
go
forward
and
no
matter
what
shall
befall
you
be
of
good
courage
then
the
vision
faded
and
after
that
yillin
sleep
was
no
longer
troubled
she
woke
refreshed
in
the
morning
and
although
she
was
lonely
for
her
sisters
there
was
hope
in
her
heart
she
took
her
weapons
and
went
forward
it
was
a
quiet
country
there
seemed
no
men
and
women
in
it
nor
even
any
animals
and
even
the
birds
were
strange
to
her
she
passed
over
a
great
rocky
plain
making
for
a
green
line
of
trees
that
seemed
to
mark
the
windings
of
a
creek
for
she
was
very
thirsty
she
found
it
a
clear
wide
stream
and
drank
deeply
then
she
wandered
along
its
banks
and
here
at
length
there
was
a
touch
of
home
for
there
were
many
crimson
parrots
in
the
trees
and
the
noise
of
their
harsh
crying
to
each
other
was
as
music
in
her
ears
they
had
their
mates
and
to
see
them
made
her
feel
less
lonely
she
found
some
roots
and
berries
which
she
ate
hoping
they
were
good
for
food
and
when
night
came
she
curled
into
a
hollow
under
a
rock
and
slept
deeply
waking
refreshed
eager
to
go
on
her
way
then
for
many
days
she
wandered
following
the
course
of
the
creek
for
she
was
afraid
to
go
far
from
water
she
was
a
strange
figure
in
her
silvery
scales
whenever
she
caught
sight
of
herself
mirrored
in
the
water
as
she
bent
to
drink
it
gave
her
a
new
throb
of
amazement
she
was
wandering
along
one
day
when
a
rustling
in
the
bushes
made
her
glance
aside
to
her
surprise
a
dog
was
looking
at
her
and
she
could
see
that
it
was
a
tame
one
yillin
had
always
loved
dogs
and
she
whistled
to
this
one
trying
to
coax
it
to
play
with
her
but
the
dog
was
suspicious
and
backed
away
from
her
growling
then
it
uttered
a
few
short
barks
and
raced
off
into
the
scrub
two
black
hunters
who
were
ranging
through
the
bush
a
little
way
off
stopped
hearing
the
barking
my
dog
has
started
game
of
some
kind
said
one
he
does
not
bark
for
nothing
let
us
go
and
look
said
the
other
they
turned
aside
in
the
direction
of
the
sound
and
presently
came
upon
the
dog
who
bounded
to
his
master
and
licked
his
hand
what
have
you
been
barking
for
demanded
his
master
patting
him
the
dog
wagged
his
tail
vigorously
and
ran
a
few
paces
into
the
bushes
i
believe
there
is
something
in
that
direction
the
hunter
said
we
might
as
well
go
and
see
chukeroo
they
moved
noiselessly
through
the
scrub
and
presently
chukeroo
caught
his
friend
arm
see
wonga
he
whispered
there
is
a
demon
let
us
fly
wonga
looked
and
saw
a
strange
glittering
figure
standing
by
a
tree
he
was
just
as
afraid
as
his
friend
but
he
was
also
full
of
curiosity
it
seems
to
be
a
he
whispered
back
see
it
has
long
hair
and
the
face
is
the
face
of
a
woman
he
pondered
watching
the
strange
apparition
and
it
carries
weapons
strange
that
a
demon
should
go
armed
chukeroo
i
should
like
to
get
hold
of
those
weapons
they
would
be
worth
having
in
a
fight
you
may
try
if
you
like
but
i
have
no
fancy
for
fighting
demons
said
chukeroo
i
do
not
know
that
i
have
either
said
wonga
perhaps
though
a
would
not
be
so
terrible
to
fight
look
how
she
glitters
when
she
moves
she
would
be
a
startling
wife
for
a
man
to
take
home
to
his
wurley
chukeroo
every
one
to
his
fancy
returned
his
friend
personally
i
prefer
mine
black
you
are
used
to
yours
but
i
have
none
yet
said
wonga
laughing
for
he
was
a
cheerful
youth
come
i
am
going
to
get
a
nearer
look
at
the
demon
are
you
afraid
very
much
but
i
suppose
i
had
better
come
said
chukeroo
grumblingly
you
are
a
fellow
wonga
and
you
will
get
into
trouble
if
you
do
not
take
care
i
only
hope
that
this
is
not
the
sort
of
demon
that
the
sorcerers
tell
us
about
who
can
blast
men
to
cinders
with
a
wave
of
the
hand
he
followed
his
friend
and
they
crept
through
the
bushes
until
they
found
a
place
where
they
could
see
the
strange
being
more
closely
in
their
excitement
they
had
forgotten
the
dog
and
suddenly
it
gave
a
loud
bark
the
shining
figure
turned
sharply
and
ran
towards
them
save
yourself
uttered
chukeroo
it
has
seen
us
they
turned
to
run
but
in
crossing
a
clear
space
chukeroo
caught
his
foot
in
a
trail
of
clematis
and
fell
headlong
scattering
his
weapons
wonga
pulled
himself
up
and
raced
back
to
help
his
friend
before
they
could
gather
all
the
fallen
spears
the
strange
being
was
upon
them
yillin
was
as
astonished
as
the
black
hunters
and
as
afraid
but
she
had
learned
to
defend
herself
and
so
she
flung
her
at
wonga
it
grazed
his
leg
and
made
him
so
angry
that
he
forgot
all
about
being
afraid
of
this
demon
and
hurled
his
spears
at
her
but
his
fear
returned
when
he
saw
them
glance
off
her
shining
scales
as
though
she
were
covered
with
glass
and
then
fall
harmlessly
to
the
ground
chukeroo
joined
in
the
fight
but
though
the
aim
of
both
hunters
was
true
nothing
seemed
to
pierce
those
magic
scales
moreover
the
strange
being
having
lost
her
picked
up
the
fallen
spears
and
flung
them
at
their
owners
so
rapidly
that
they
thought
themselves
lucky
in
being
able
to
dodge
behind
trees
with
whole
skins
she
is
indeed
a
demon
gasped
chukeroo
she
may
be
but
she
is
very
like
a
woman
said
wonga
and
i
am
not
going
home
to
tell
the
other
warriors
that
a
woman
has
stolen
my
spears
even
if
she
does
happen
to
be
a
demon
besides
you
know
as
well
as
i
do
that
they
will
not
believe
us
even
your
own
wife
will
laugh
at
you
and
she
will
not
believe
that
is
true
enough
said
chukeroo
gloomily
what
are
we
to
do
i
will
make
you
armour
said
wonga
then
we
will
go
back
and
when
the
demon
throws
the
spears
at
you
they
will
stick
in
the
armour
and
i
will
rush
in
and
secure
them
i
do
not
know
that
it
is
much
of
a
plan
but
at
least
i
have
no
better
said
chukeroo
be
quick
or
the
demon
may
come
and
find
us
unarmed
so
wonga
broke
off
young
saplings
and
lashed
them
round
his
friend
with
strips
of
twisted
stringy
bark
fibre
until
nothing
of
him
could
be
seen
and
he
had
great
difficulty
in
moving
then
slowly
and
cautiously
they
made
their
way
back
to
the
open
space
where
they
had
fought
yillin
was
standing
wearily
by
a
tree
with
the
spears
in
her
hand
she
jumped
round
as
they
came
and
while
she
flung
spear
after
spear
at
chukeroo
wonga
ran
through
the
trees
and
came
behind
her
his
foot
struck
against
her
own
and
he
picked
it
up
and
rushed
at
her
the
point
caught
in
her
shining
scales
and
ripped
them
up
as
though
they
were
paper
they
fell
in
tatters
about
her
do
not
kill
me
she
cried
i
am
a
chief
daughter
a
chief
daughter
are
you
said
wonga
suddenly
his
angry
face
grew
soft
with
pity
why
i
thought
you
a
demon
he
said
and
lo
you
are
only
a
poor
frightened
little
girl
so
the
wanderings
of
yillin
came
to
an
end
and
though
she
missed
happiness
with
arawotya
in
the
sky
yet
as
wonkawala
had
said
in
her
vision
she
found
it
elsewhere
for
wonga
took
her
home
and
married
her
and
his
tribe
treated
her
with
honour
because
she
was
the
daughter
of
a
mighty
chief
and
later
on
wonga
became
the
chief
of
his
own
tribe
and
she
helped
him
to
rule
it
in
wisdom
very
often
she
was
lonely
for
her
four
sisters
especially
for
little
peeka
whom
she
had
loved
best
of
all
but
she
comforted
herself
by
thinking
that
they
were
happy
with
arawotya
in
the
sky
and
that
some
day
she
would
find
them
again
then
together
they
would
go
at
the
last
to
maker
of
men
and
join
their
father
wonkawala
there
were
five
stars
in
the
southern
sky
that
she
liked
to
watch
for
she
grew
to
believe
that
they
were
her
sisters
and
that
the
tiniest
of
the
five
was
her
little
dog
dulderana
they
are
the
stars
of
the
southern
cross
and
it
seemed
to
yillin
that
they
looked
down
at
her
and
smiled
otherwise
yillin
was
never
lonely
for
many
children
came
to
her
and
wonga
and
her
wurley
always
seemed
full
of
jolly
black
babies
and
wee
lasses
and
lads
yillin
did
not
mind
however
many
there
were
especially
as
she
did
not
have
to
worry
about
clothes
for
them
they
grew
into
strong
merry
boys
and
girls
who
loved
dancing
and
songs
and
laughter
just
as
she
had
always
loved
them
she
used
to
tell
them
the
story
of
her
wanderings
and
when
she
came
to
the
part
about
the
silver
scales
that
had
once
covered
her
they
would
pretend
to
hunt
for
them
on
her
black
skin
and
would
laugh
very
much
because
they
could
never
find
any
and
wonga
would
laugh
too
and
say
ah
well
many
men
find
their
wives
demons
after
they
have
married
them
so
i
was
lucky
in
only
thinking
that
of
mine
beforehand
and
then
finding
i
had
made
a
mistake
xi
the
burning
of
the
crows
no
one
in
the
bush
ever
had
a
good
word
to
say
for
the
crows
from
the
very
earliest
times
they
were
a
noisy
mischievous
race
always
poking
their
strong
beaks
into
what
did
not
concern
them
and
never
so
happy
as
when
they
were
annoying
other
people
whatever
a
mother
crow
taught
her
chickens
civility
and
good
manners
were
not
included
in
the
lessons
they
were
accomplishments
for
which
none
of
the
family
had
the
slightest
use
it
did
not
at
all
trouble
the
wokala
as
the
crows
were
called
that
they
were
unpopular
indeed
they
rather
gloried
in
the
amount
of
they
were
able
to
excite
among
the
bush
folk
they
were
powerful
birds
well
able
to
hold
their
own
in
any
quarrel
with
birds
of
their
own
size
and
so
quick
and
daring
that
they
would
even
steal
from
animals
or
attack
weak
ones
secure
in
the
advantage
given
them
by
their
strong
wings
they
made
so
many
enemies
however
that
they
took
to
going
about
in
flocks
so
that
no
one
dared
molest
them
not
even
wildoo
the
eagle
or
kellelek
the
cockatoo
especially
did
wildoo
hate
the
wokala
he
was
always
proud
as
the
king
of
the
birds
has
every
right
to
be
and
among
all
birds
that
fly
his
word
was
law
he
liked
to
keep
good
order
and
if
any
bird
displeased
him
a
few
quiet
words
possibly
accompanied
by
a
discreet
peck
or
a
blow
from
one
of
his
great
wings
was
more
than
enough
to
bring
the
offender
to
his
senses
one
day
he
had
occasion
to
punish
one
of
the
wokala
who
had
stolen
the
meal
laboriously
provided
by
the
wife
of
the
mopoke
for
her
husband
who
was
ill
the
wokala
battered
and
furious
flew
away
and
told
his
story
to
the
other
crows
who
equally
furious
flew
in
a
mob
to
the
high
crag
where
wildoo
had
his
nest
there
was
no
one
there
for
it
was
too
late
in
the
season
to
find
chickens
so
the
wokala
amused
themselves
by
scattering
the
nest
to
pieces
and
when
wildoo
and
his
wife
came
home
from
hunting
they
hid
among
the
bushes
and
screamed
all
sorts
of
insulting
things
at
them
wildoo
took
no
notice
openly
it
would
have
been
beneath
his
dignity
to
go
hunting
smaller
birds
in
thick
bushes
which
the
wokala
very
well
knew
he
merely
folded
his
wings
and
with
his
wife
perched
on
the
edge
of
the
rocky
shelf
where
his
nest
had
been
and
stared
out
across
the
tossing
green
sea
of
that
clothed
the
rolling
hills
below
his
yellow
eyes
full
of
silent
anger
gradually
the
wokala
grew
tired
of
screaming
and
becoming
hungry
flew
away
after
that
the
wokala
became
more
insolent
than
ever
even
wildoo
was
afraid
of
them
they
said
and
they
kept
together
in
a
mob
and
lost
no
chance
of
being
rude
to
him
more
and
more
they
attacked
and
insulted
the
other
birds
until
no
one
felt
safe
if
there
were
any
chance
of
the
evil
wokala
coming
near
again
and
again
complaints
came
to
wildoo
of
their
wicked
doings
and
wildoo
heard
them
in
silence
nodding
his
head
with
his
brain
busy
behind
his
yellow
eyes
but
he
said
nothing
until
at
length
the
other
birds
began
to
ask
themselves
was
it
really
true
that
wildoo
was
afraid
wildoo
was
not
at
all
afraid
of
a
flock
of
squawking
wokala
but
he
was
very
much
afraid
of
being
made
to
look
ridiculous
he
had
no
intention
of
making
a
false
step
and
he
did
not
quite
know
what
to
do
there
was
no
one
for
him
to
talk
to
for
the
eagle
is
a
lonely
bird
not
like
chirnip
the
or
tautani
the
cormorant
with
dozens
and
dozens
of
friends
he
is
a
king
and
therefore
he
is
lonely
and
being
naturally
silent
he
does
not
talk
much
even
to
his
wife
all
by
himself
he
had
to
think
out
the
problem
of
what
to
do
about
the
wokala
and
meanwhile
the
wokala
perched
above
his
nest
and
insulted
him
and
dropped
bits
of
stick
down
upon
his
rocky
shelf
and
screamed
rude
things
at
his
wife
until
she
said
crossly
to
wildoo
i
can
not
think
why
you
do
not
make
an
end
of
those
abominable
little
white
birds
they
are
a
disgrace
to
any
decent
kingdom
and
you
have
not
the
spirit
of
a
bandicoot
this
annoyed
and
hurt
wildoo
but
he
said
nothing
only
looked
at
her
until
she
caught
a
gleam
of
fire
in
the
depths
of
his
yellow
eyes
perhaps
you
did
not
know
that
in
the
very
early
times
all
the
wokala
were
white
they
were
the
whitest
of
all
the
birds
of
the
bush
without
a
single
grey
or
coloured
feather
in
all
their
bodies
so
that
there
was
a
saying
in
the
bush
as
white
as
a
wokala
they
were
very
proud
of
it
too
and
thought
it
quite
a
disgrace
if
one
of
their
chickens
showed
a
sign
of
being
even
creamy
in
colour
once
he
was
nearly
fledged
they
kept
themselves
very
clean
going
often
to
bathe
and
when
they
flew
about
in
a
flock
their
dazzling
whiteness
almost
hurt
the
eye
while
if
they
perched
in
a
dead
they
looked
like
big
snowflakes
against
the
grey
branches
even
kellelek
the
cockatoo
was
dingy
compared
to
the
gleaming
whiteness
of
the
wokala
somehow
it
seemed
to
make
their
bad
behaviour
worse
since
no
one
would
expect
a
beautiful
bird
like
polished
marble
to
have
the
manners
of
a
jungle
pig
summer
ended
early
that
year
with
a
great
followed
by
a
month
of
wild
wind
and
driving
rain
and
all
the
birds
were
rather
uncomfortable
because
the
moulting
season
was
scarcely
over
most
of
all
the
wokala
were
annoyed
they
liked
their
white
feathers
so
much
and
were
so
proud
of
their
smart
appearance
that
they
always
delayed
moulting
as
long
as
ever
they
could
and
now
the
bad
weather
caught
them
in
a
worse
state
than
the
other
birds
when
the
rains
ended
early
frosts
came
and
found
the
wokala
without
any
of
their
new
feather
cloaks
ready
they
used
to
huddle
together
among
the
thickest
trees
shivering
and
untidy
in
that
part
of
the
country
there
is
a
great
black
ironstone
hill
treeless
and
forbidding
few
birds
go
there
for
there
is
nowhere
to
perch
and
but
little
food
except
the
tiny
that
sun
themselves
in
the
hot
mornings
wildoo
knew
it
well
for
he
often
flew
over
it
and
occasionally
he
was
accustomed
to
stand
on
a
shelf
at
the
mouth
of
a
cave
near
the
top
a
black
hole
in
the
hillside
where
no
one
but
an
eagle
would
willingly
perch
alone
he
took
refuge
in
the
cave
one
morning
during
a
fierce
and
it
was
there
that
an
idea
came
to
him
that
night
as
he
came
flying
homewards
he
brought
in
his
great
talons
a
bundle
of
dry
sticks
and
as
he
flapped
his
way
over
the
black
ironstone
hill
he
dropped
down
on
the
ledge
and
made
a
heap
of
his
sticks
on
the
floor
of
the
cave
the
next
morning
he
did
the
same
and
so
it
went
on
for
many
days
until
he
had
a
big
pile
of
smooth
sticks
something
like
a
great
nest
his
wife
came
with
him
one
evening
and
was
very
much
amused
why
have
you
taken
to
playing
with
sticks
she
asked
laughing
i
never
saw
such
a
funny
heap
is
it
a
game
but
wildoo
only
looked
at
her
sourly
and
said
be
quiet
woman
after
the
manner
of
husbands
and
since
she
was
more
sensible
than
most
wives
she
was
quiet
it
was
after
his
heap
of
sticks
was
ready
that
wildoo
went
to
look
for
the
wokala
they
had
been
far
too
uncomfortable
lately
to
continue
to
be
rude
to
him
and
in
fact
were
keeping
out
of
the
way
of
every
one
so
that
he
had
some
difficulty
in
finding
them
and
might
have
given
it
up
but
for
corridella
the
who
remembered
having
seen
them
near
a
sheltered
gully
between
two
hills
they
are
cold
said
corridella
laughing
oh
so
cold
and
so
sorry
for
themselves
there
is
no
impudence
left
in
them
cold
indeed
must
be
the
night
that
chills
the
impudence
of
the
wokala
said
wildoo
it
is
going
to
be
a
very
cold
night
said
corridella
already
there
is
a
sharp
nip
of
frost
in
the
air
i
think
that
some
of
the
wokala
will
be
dead
before
morning
for
none
of
them
have
their
new
feather
cloaks
nearly
ready
he
chuckled
well
no
one
in
the
bush
will
mourn
for
them
perhaps
they
will
realize
now
that
it
does
not
pay
to
make
enemies
of
every
one
the
wokala
will
never
learn
a
lesson
answered
wildoo
they
are
always
satisfied
with
themselves
and
even
though
some
may
die
the
others
will
forget
all
about
it
once
they
have
their
shining
white
cloaks
and
can
flock
into
the
again
but
possibly
they
may
not
be
so
lucky
who
can
tell
he
also
chuckled
looking
as
wise
as
an
owl
but
when
corridella
asked
him
what
he
meant
he
pretended
to
go
to
sleep
and
corridella
who
knew
better
than
to
pester
an
eagle
with
too
many
questions
said
good
evening
and
sailed
homeward
across
the
left
to
himself
wildoo
waited
until
no
bird
was
in
sight
and
then
flapped
heavily
away
from
his
rocky
shelf
and
dived
downward
to
the
gully
it
did
not
take
him
long
to
find
the
wokala
they
did
not
gleam
with
the
whiteness
of
snow
for
they
were
moulting
and
very
shabby
and
a
few
were
dressed
mainly
in
but
their
voices
were
just
as
harsh
as
ever
and
guided
wildoo
to
where
they
were
huddling
among
some
trees
already
a
cold
wind
was
whistling
down
between
the
hills
sighing
and
moaning
in
the
branches
there
is
no
tree
in
all
australia
so
mournful
as
the
on
a
cold
night
when
each
long
needle
seems
to
sing
a
separate
little
song
of
woe
already
the
miserable
wokala
were
sorry
that
they
had
chosen
to
roost
there
suddenly
great
wings
darkened
the
evening
sky
above
them
and
looking
up
they
saw
wildoo
he
perched
on
a
limb
of
a
dead
far
overhead
and
looked
down
at
them
laughing
there
seemed
to
the
shivering
wokala
something
very
terrible
in
the
sound
of
his
laughter
kwah
they
whispered
wildoo
has
found
us
now
he
will
be
revenged
they
knew
they
could
not
fly
swiftly
enough
to
escape
him
and
they
began
to
creep
downwards
hoping
to
hide
among
the
bracken
fern
that
clothed
the
gully
but
wildoo
called
to
them
and
to
their
astonishment
his
voice
sounded
friendly
oh
wokala
he
cried
are
you
very
cold
ay
we
are
cold
said
the
wokala
as
well
as
they
could
for
their
beaks
were
chattering
with
fear
and
shivering
no
wonder
seeing
how
little
you
have
on
said
wildoo
a
pity
you
did
not
get
your
new
white
feather
cloaks
ready
earlier
instead
of
spending
your
time
in
annoying
honest
folk
well
perhaps
you
will
have
more
sense
next
year
doubtless
we
shall
if
we
live
said
the
oldest
wokala
but
it
seems
likely
that
not
many
of
us
will
live
for
we
are
nearly
frozen
already
how
distressing
for
you
said
wildoo
especially
as
it
will
be
far
colder
before
morning
than
it
is
now
these
gullies
are
the
chilliest
places
in
the
bush
on
a
frosty
night
the
beaks
of
the
wokala
chattered
anew
we
came
for
shelter
said
the
old
wokala
miserably
but
you
say
truth
wildoo
i
think
the
has
his
home
down
here
is
it
any
warmer
where
you
are
very
little
said
wildoo
and
the
wind
is
singing
through
these
branches
but
i
know
of
a
sheltered
place
for
all
that
kwah
said
the
wokala
all
together
a
sheltered
place
oh
wildoo
you
are
great
and
and
and
beautiful
will
you
not
tell
us
where
it
is
great
and
beautiful
am
i
said
wildoo
with
a
chuckle
that
is
not
the
sort
of
thing
you
have
been
calling
me
all
these
months
however
it
is
lucky
for
you
that
i
am
also
i
would
not
willingly
see
any
of
my
people
die
of
cold
not
even
the
wokala
who
deserve
little
of
anyone
then
you
will
tell
us
where
is
the
sheltered
place
chattered
the
wokala
fly
across
to
the
black
mountain
said
wildoo
there
is
an
ironstone
wurley
near
the
top
i
will
guide
you
to
it
if
you
like
it
is
big
enough
for
you
all
and
there
is
a
fine
heap
of
sticks
on
which
to
perch
the
wind
will
not
blow
inside
it
and
the
morning
sun
will
shine
right
into
it
it
sounds
too
wonderful
to
be
true
said
the
wokala
is
it
dry
this
ironstone
wurley
dry
as
old
bones
answered
wildoo
oh
you
would
be
in
luck
to
get
there
you
would
forget
all
your
troubles
one
would
think
that
impossible
shivered
the
old
wokala
he
was
very
sorry
for
himself
but
if
you
will
really
guide
us
there
then
be
quick
wildoo
or
none
of
us
will
be
able
to
fly
at
all
very
well
wildoo
answered
i
will
go
slowly
as
i
suppose
you
are
all
stiff
follow
me
and
come
down
when
you
see
me
perch
he
spread
his
great
wings
and
looked
down
at
them
for
a
moment
with
a
little
smile
and
if
they
had
not
been
so
eager
and
so
cold
they
might
have
hesitated
at
the
expression
in
his
yellow
eyes
but
as
usual
the
wokala
thought
only
of
themselves
and
as
they
had
learned
to
believe
that
wildoo
was
afraid
of
them
they
never
suspected
that
he
might
be
leading
them
into
a
trap
they
cried
kwah
kwah
and
rose
into
the
air
after
him
as
soon
as
the
flapping
of
the
mighty
wings
told
them
that
he
had
left
the
even
to
fly
slowly
was
difficult
so
stiff
with
cold
were
they
but
they
all
persevered
except
one
young
hen
a
pretty
young
thing
whose
weary
wings
would
not
do
their
duty
she
made
a
brave
attempt
to
rise
but
before
the
flight
had
cleared
the
big
dead
she
had
to
drop
back
thankful
to
find
a
secure
perch
on
a
jutting
limb
ky
she
whimpered
i
can
never
fly
all
the
way
to
the
black
mountain
i
must
die
here
she
crept
along
the
limb
until
she
came
to
the
trunk
and
there
luck
awaited
her
in
the
fork
was
an
old
which
had
not
been
used
for
many
seasons
it
was
dry
and
warm
sheltered
from
the
bitter
wind
and
soft
underfoot
with
rotting
leaves
pleasant
to
the
touch
the
young
wokala
hopped
in
thankfully
and
it
seemed
the
last
touch
to
her
wonderful
good
fortune
that
she
immediately
met
a
fine
fat
grub
she
promptly
ate
it
for
her
supper
tucked
her
head
under
her
wing
nestled
into
the
farthest
corner
and
went
to
sleep
remarking
drowsily
this
is
better
than
all
wildoo
ironstone
wurleys
the
other
wokala
did
not
notice
that
the
young
hen
had
dropped
back
or
if
they
did
they
did
not
worry
about
her
weary
as
they
were
it
took
all
their
strength
to
keep
wildoo
in
sight
even
though
he
kept
his
word
and
flew
slowly
they
were
thankful
when
at
length
he
sank
lower
and
came
to
rest
on
a
big
boulder
by
the
mouth
of
the
cave
near
the
the
wokala
followed
him
in
a
straggling
line
and
perched
on
the
shelf
outside
the
cave
there
you
are
wildoo
said
nodding
towards
the
yawning
hole
in
the
hillside
that
is
your
ironstone
wurley
and
i
will
promise
you
that
you
will
find
it
dry
and
free
from
draughts
there
is
nothing
living
there
asked
the
old
wokala
looking
a
little
doubtfully
at
the
cave
nothing
at
all
all
you
will
find
there
is
a
heap
of
dry
sticks
you
can
perch
there
and
keep
each
other
warm
stay
there
if
you
like
it
well
enough
until
your
new
feather
cloaks
are
ready
you
are
really
scarcely
fit
for
decent
society
now
wildoo
cast
a
glance
at
the
shivering
birds
as
they
clustered
on
the
rocky
shelf
then
he
flew
off
again
into
the
gathering
darkness
whatever
is
wildoo
about
asked
kellelek
the
cockatoo
of
his
hens
he
seems
to
be
leading
all
the
wokala
round
the
sky
a
funny
nurse
he
looked
and
with
a
funny
lot
of
chickens
no
wonder
he
waited
for
dusk
before
he
would
be
seen
with
them
said
one
of
his
wives
contemptuously
i
flew
by
their
tree
and
really
they
were
a
positive
disgrace
and
they
always
think
themselves
so
smart
oh
they
be
smart
enough
again
said
kellelek
laughing
wait
until
they
have
their
new
feathers
on
and
you
will
be
just
as
jealous
of
them
as
ever
you
were
there
is
no
doubt
that
the
wokala
are
smart
that
is
for
people
who
prefer
plain
white
i
like
a
good
sulphur
crest
myself
but
then
it
all
a
matter
of
opinion
well
do
let
the
wokala
know
that
you
admire
them
or
they
will
be
worse
than
ever
said
his
wives
ruffling
their
feathers
angrily
meanwhile
the
wokala
had
hesitated
just
for
a
moment
before
entering
the
cave
then
a
fresh
blast
of
cold
wind
swept
across
the
face
of
the
mountain
and
they
waited
no
longer
but
fluttered
in
before
it
in
a
hurrying
jostling
flock
it
was
just
as
wildoo
had
told
them
warm
and
dry
and
with
a
big
heap
of
dry
sticks
in
the
middle
just
the
thing
for
them
to
perch
on
they
hopped
up
eagerly
huddling
together
for
warmth
scrambling
and
fighting
for
the
best
places
soon
they
were
all
comfortably
settled
and
at
last
warmth
began
to
steal
back
into
their
shivering
bodies
a
good
thing
we
made
wildoo
afraid
of
us
said
one
sleepily
otherwise
we
should
never
have
known
of
this
splendid
wurley
the
others
uttered
drowsy
murmurs
of
kwah
as
they
drifted
into
slumber
but
far
away
on
his
mountain
shelf
wildoo
sat
and
waited
his
yellow
eyes
wide
and
wakeful
the
dusk
deepened
into
night
and
far
off
from
his
perch
on
a
tall
stringy
bark
tree
old
the
mopoke
sent
out
his
long
cry
mo
poke
mo
poke
presently
came
a
dim
radiance
in
the
east
and
wildoo
stirred
a
little
peera
comes
he
muttered
peera
the
moon
came
up
slowly
until
all
the
bush
was
flooded
with
her
dim
light
falling
into
shadow
now
and
then
when
dark
clouds
drifted
across
her
face
wildoo
waited
until
she
was
above
the
with
her
beams
falling
upon
the
ironstone
mountain
then
he
took
a
in
his
talons
and
flew
swiftly
away
never
pausing
until
he
alighted
on
the
shelf
before
the
cave
he
laid
the
down
and
went
softly
to
the
dark
opening
listening
there
came
only
the
sound
of
the
breathing
of
the
wokala
with
now
and
then
a
muffled
caw
as
one
dreamed
perhaps
of
cold
and
hunger
as
his
eyes
grew
accustomed
to
the
light
wildoo
could
see
them
a
huddled
white
mass
upon
the
heap
of
sticks
that
was
all
he
wanted
and
he
went
back
swiftly
for
his
and
with
it
went
into
the
cave
very
softly
he
slipped
it
into
the
dry
heart
of
the
heap
of
sticks
below
the
sleeping
wokala
he
waited
until
little
began
to
curl
up
and
a
faint
glow
came
from
within
the
heap
now
you
will
be
warm
enough
my
friends
he
muttered
he
hurried
out
of
the
cave
and
flew
slowly
to
the
nearest
tree
on
the
hill
opposite
the
black
mountain
there
he
perched
and
waited
very
soon
all
the
dark
mouth
of
the
cave
was
filled
with
glowing
radiance
and
clouds
of
smoke
came
billowing
out
and
rolled
down
the
hill
then
came
loud
and
terrified
cawing
and
wildoo
thought
he
could
see
dark
forms
fluttering
out
through
the
smoke
his
yellow
eyes
gleamed
at
the
sight
and
then
clouds
came
suddenly
across
the
face
of
the
moon
and
a
fierce
wind
blew
with
driving
rain
that
beat
into
the
mouth
of
the
cave
it
blotted
out
the
glow
and
the
wind
carried
away
the
cries
when
all
was
quiet
wildoo
flapped
off
to
his
nest
he
was
back
next
morning
on
the
boulder
outside
the
cave
and
with
him
all
the
birds
of
the
bush
whom
he
had
collected
as
he
came
saying
to
them
come
and
see
what
happens
to
those
who
insult
wildoo
the
black
mouth
of
the
ironstone
cave
looked
grim
and
forbidding
and
peering
in
the
birds
could
see
the
charred
ends
of
the
dry
sticks
scattered
on
the
floor
round
a
heap
of
ashes
then
from
the
inner
recesses
of
the
cave
came
a
strange
procession
and
at
the
sight
the
kooka
burra
burst
into
a
peal
of
laughter
for
it
was
the
wokala
they
came
slowly
but
where
were
their
white
feathers
of
which
they
had
been
so
proud
all
were
gone
singed
off
close
to
their
bodies
and
their
bodies
were
blackened
with
smoke
queer
naked
birds
they
looked
creeping
out
into
the
sunshine
and
there
was
no
pride
left
in
them
they
looked
up
and
saw
wildoo
and
the
laughing
birds
of
all
the
bush
and
with
a
loud
miserable
cawing
they
fled
back
into
the
cave
no
one
saw
the
wokala
again
for
a
time
but
after
a
long
while
they
came
out
again
this
time
with
all
their
feathers
fully
grown
no
longer
however
were
they
white
the
whitest
of
all
birds
their
new
feathers
were
a
glossy
black
they
looked
at
each
other
for
a
moment
with
a
kind
of
horror
then
they
rose
into
the
air
with
a
swift
beating
of
their
wings
and
calling
kwah
kwah
they
fled
across
the
sky
and
as
they
flew
another
cawing
was
heard
and
a
white
bird
rose
and
flew
to
meet
them
the
wokala
hen
who
had
been
left
behind
and
who
had
taken
refuge
in
the
she
was
now
the
only
white
wokala
left
in
all
the
world
they
met
in
and
at
sight
of
the
strange
black
birds
with
the
familiar
voices
the
white
wokala
uttered
a
scream
and
fled
away
never
to
be
seen
again
since
then
always
the
crows
have
been
black
they
found
their
old
impudence
again
after
a
while
and
became
what
they
had
been
when
they
were
white
always
the
nuisances
of
the
bush
vagabonds
and
robbers
and
bullies
but
still
the
terror
of
the
ironstone
wurley
is
upon
them
and
they
never
venture
into
caves
but
live
in
the
big
trees
where
they
can
see
far
and
wide
and
where
no
creeping
enemy
can
come
upon
them
in
the
darkness
and
wildoo
the
king
of
the
birds
never
finds
them
near
his
nest
nor
need
he
ever
speak
to
them
one
glance
from
him
is
enough
for
the
wokala
they
would
fly
to
the
deepest
recesses
of
the
bush
rather
than
face
the
gleam
of
his
yellow
eyes
xii
the
bear
chapter
i
was
a
little
black
boy
baby
his
father
and
mother
had
no
other
children
and
so
they
were
very
proud
of
him
and
he
always
had
enough
to
eat
it
is
often
very
different
when
there
are
many
hungry
pickaninnies
to
be
fed
especially
in
dry
seasons
when
roots
and
yams
and
berries
are
hard
to
find
and
a
black
mother
task
of
filling
her
becomes
more
difficult
every
day
then
it
may
happen
that
the
children
are
quite
often
hungry
and
their
ribs
show
plainly
through
their
black
skins
and
they
learn
to
pick
up
all
kinds
of
odd
food
that
white
children
would
consider
horrible
insects
grubs
and
moths
and
queer
fungi
which
may
sometimes
give
them
bad
pains
although
it
is
not
an
easy
thing
to
give
a
black
child
indigestion
but
had
not
known
any
hard
times
he
was
born
a
cheerful
round
baby
quite
light
in
colour
at
first
and
as
he
darkened
he
became
rounder
and
jollier
his
hair
curled
in
tight
little
rings
all
over
his
head
and
his
nose
was
beautifully
flat
so
flat
that
his
mother
did
not
need
to
press
it
down
to
make
him
as
most
of
the
black
mothers
do
to
their
babies
he
was
very
strong
too
with
a
straight
little
back
and
limbs
and
when
his
teeth
came
they
could
crunch
up
bones
quite
easily
or
even
the
hard
nardoo
berries
his
mother
thought
he
was
the
most
beautiful
pickaninny
that
was
ever
born
which
is
an
idea
all
mothers
have
about
their
babies
but
mother
that
she
was
right
he
had
so
many
good
things
to
eat
that
he
grew
fatter
and
fatter
his
father
brought
home
game
wallaby
wombat
iguana
porcupines
bandicoots
opossums
and
though
it
was
polite
to
give
away
a
good
deal
to
his
wife
father
there
was
always
plenty
for
little
then
delicious
bits
of
snake
came
his
way
and
long
white
as
well
as
all
the
native
fruits
and
berries
that
the
black
women
find
and
he
had
plenty
of
creek
water
to
drink
so
long
as
you
give
a
wild
blackfellow
good
water
he
will
always
manage
to
forage
for
food
did
not
have
to
forage
it
interested
his
father
and
mother
tremendously
to
do
all
that
they
could
for
him
and
watch
him
grow
as
soon
as
he
could
toddle
about
his
father
made
him
tiny
and
a
boomerang
and
tried
to
teach
him
to
throw
them
and
his
mother
squatting
in
the
shade
of
the
wurley
would
laugh
to
see
the
baby
thing
struggling
with
the
weapons
of
a
man
and
while
she
laughed
she
was
prouder
than
ever
she
used
to
rub
his
limbs
to
make
them
supple
and
strong
he
did
not
wear
any
clothes
at
all
so
that
she
was
never
worried
about
keeping
his
wardrobe
in
order
instead
she
was
able
to
give
all
her
time
to
making
him
into
what
she
thought
to
be
the
best
possible
kind
of
boy
and
however
that
may
have
been
it
is
quite
certain
that
there
never
was
a
happier
pickaninny
it
was
when
was
nearly
six
years
old
that
the
evil
spirit
of
trouble
came
to
him
sickness
fell
upon
the
tribe
no
one
knew
how
it
came
and
the
could
not
drive
it
away
first
of
all
the
people
had
terrible
headaches
and
the
or
doctor
used
to
treat
them
in
the
usual
manner
he
would
dig
out
a
round
sod
of
earth
and
making
the
patient
lie
down
with
his
head
in
the
hole
would
put
the
sod
on
his
head
and
stand
on
it
or
sit
on
it
to
squeeze
out
the
pain
if
this
were
not
successful
he
would
tie
a
cord
tightly
round
the
head
and
cut
him
with
a
sharp
shell
or
flint
beating
his
head
with
a
little
stick
to
make
the
blood
flow
freely
these
excellent
measures
had
in
the
past
cured
many
severe
headaches
but
they
could
not
cure
the
sickness
now
so
the
had
the
patient
carried
out
of
the
camp
the
bearers
carried
him
slowly
singing
a
mournful
chant
and
behind
them
came
all
the
sick
man
friends
sweeping
the
ground
with
boughs
to
sweep
away
the
bad
power
that
had
caused
the
disease
this
bad
power
was
the
said
the
work
of
a
terrible
being
called
bori
but
whether
it
was
bori
fault
or
whether
the
tribe
had
simply
brought
sickness
on
themselves
by
allowing
the
camp
to
become
very
dirty
the
could
not
drive
away
the
sickness
it
grew
worse
and
worse
and
people
died
every
day
was
only
a
little
lad
but
he
was
unhappy
and
frightened
although
he
did
not
understand
at
all
the
air
was
always
full
of
the
sound
of
the
groaning
and
crying
of
those
people
who
were
ill
and
of
lamenting
and
mourning
for
the
dead
everybody
was
terribly
afraid
the
blacks
believed
that
their
bad
spirits
were
angry
with
them
and
that
nothing
could
do
them
any
good
and
so
many
died
from
sheer
fright
thinking
that
once
they
were
taken
ill
they
were
doomed
and
that
it
was
no
good
to
make
a
fight
against
the
mysterious
enemy
that
was
stupid
but
they
did
not
know
any
better
then
there
came
a
heavy
rain
and
after
it
was
over
and
the
sun
had
come
out
to
smile
upon
a
fresh
clean
world
the
sickness
began
to
get
better
and
pass
away
but
just
at
the
last
it
came
to
the
wurley
where
lived
with
his
father
and
mother
could
not
understand
why
his
parents
could
not
get
up
and
go
to
find
food
they
lay
in
the
wurley
together
shivering
under
all
the
rugs
and
talking
quickly
in
queer
high
voices
that
he
could
not
make
out
at
all
they
called
often
for
water
and
he
brought
it
to
them
in
his
little
tarnuk
or
going
backwards
and
forwards
to
the
creek
and
up
and
down
its
banks
until
his
little
legs
were
very
tired
long
after
he
was
tired
he
kept
on
going
for
water
then
there
came
a
time
when
they
could
not
lift
the
tarnuk
and
he
tried
to
hold
it
to
their
lips
so
that
they
could
drink
but
he
was
not
very
successful
and
much
of
the
water
was
spilt
you
see
he
was
only
a
very
little
afraid
boy
he
woke
up
one
morning
cold
and
hungry
there
was
no
more
food
in
the
wurley
and
no
voices
only
a
great
silence
he
crept
under
the
rug
to
his
father
and
mother
but
they
were
quite
still
and
when
he
called
to
them
they
did
not
answer
he
rubbed
their
cold
faces
with
a
shaking
little
hand
but
no
warmth
came
to
them
then
he
broke
into
loud
frightened
crying
like
any
other
lonely
little
boy
presently
some
of
the
blacks
came
to
the
wurley
and
pointed
at
the
quiet
bodies
under
the
rug
and
jabbered
very
hard
beckoning
to
others
to
come
heard
them
say
a
great
many
times
and
he
knew
that
it
meant
dead
but
he
did
not
know
that
his
father
and
mother
would
never
speak
to
him
any
more
only
when
an
old
woman
picked
him
up
and
carried
him
away
he
understood
that
a
terrible
thing
had
happened
to
him
and
he
cried
more
bitterly
than
ever
calling
to
his
mother
she
had
always
run
to
him
when
he
called
but
now
she
did
not
come
chapter
ii
after
that
hard
times
came
upon
little
there
were
none
of
his
own
family
left
for
the
sickness
had
taken
them
all
his
father
and
mother
had
been
the
last
to
die
and
that
made
the
blacks
think
that
very
probably
bori
the
evil
spirit
had
been
especially
angry
with
family
because
so
many
of
them
had
died
and
the
last
terrible
blow
of
the
disease
had
fallen
on
their
wurley
indeed
for
awhile
they
argued
as
to
whether
it
would
not
be
better
to
kill
too
so
that
so
troublesome
a
family
should
be
quite
stamped
out
with
no
further
chance
of
annoying
bori
and
bringing
trouble
upon
the
tribe
they
did
not
spare
him
out
of
any
idea
of
pity
but
because
so
many
men
and
boys
had
died
that
the
tribe
had
become
seriously
weakened
and
it
seemed
foolish
to
kill
a
strong
and
healthy
fellow
like
it
was
very
important
for
a
tribe
to
keep
up
its
fighting
strength
for
there
was
always
a
chance
that
another
band
of
blacks
might
come
upon
them
and
want
to
fight
in
which
case
the
weaker
tribe
might
be
swallowed
up
so
boy
babies
were
thought
a
good
deal
of
and
for
that
reason
the
blacks
did
not
make
an
end
of
little
but
he
had
a
very
bad
time
for
all
that
no
one
wanted
him
he
was
nobody
boy
and
that
hurts
just
the
same
whether
a
boy
be
black
or
white
never
was
there
so
lonely
a
little
fellow
the
other
children
were
half
afraid
of
him
because
the
fear
of
bori
anger
yet
hung
about
him
they
would
not
let
him
join
in
their
games
and
took
a
savage
delight
in
hunting
him
away
from
their
wurleys
another
black
family
had
taken
possession
of
his
father
wurley
and
no
home
was
left
to
him
he
used
to
wander
about
miserably
often
sleeping
in
the
open
air
curled
up
in
the
shadow
of
a
bush
or
in
a
hollow
if
it
were
cold
or
wet
he
would
creep
noiselessly
into
a
hut
when
he
thought
every
one
would
be
asleep
and
quite
often
he
was
kicked
out
again
he
was
always
hungry
now
his
father
and
mother
had
taken
such
care
of
him
and
had
loved
so
much
to
keep
him
fed
that
he
had
never
learned
how
to
find
food
for
himself
he
would
wander
about
in
the
bush
looking
for
such
things
as
his
mother
had
brought
him
but
he
knew
so
little
that
often
he
ate
quite
the
wrong
things
which
made
him
very
sick
he
learned
a
good
deal
about
food
in
that
way
but
the
learning
was
not
pleasant
work
it
was
a
bad
year
for
food
dry
weather
had
come
and
game
was
scarce
it
was
hard
for
the
to
bring
home
enough
for
their
own
children
without
having
to
provide
for
a
hungry
boy
of
six
who
belonged
to
nobody
used
to
hang
about
the
in
the
hope
of
having
scraps
of
food
thrown
to
him
but
not
many
came
his
way
when
so
many
were
hungry
the
food
was
quickly
eaten
up
sometimes
a
woman
pitying
the
shrinking
little
lad
would
hastily
toss
him
a
bone
or
a
fragment
of
meat
and
though
you
would
not
have
cared
for
the
way
it
was
cooked
thought
that
these
morsels
were
the
most
delicious
he
had
ever
tasted
you
see
a
wild
blackfellow
has
not
much
to
think
about
except
food
he
has
no
schools
no
daily
papers
no
market
days
or
picture
shows
or
telephones
the
wild
bush
is
his
and
all
he
asks
or
expects
of
it
is
that
it
shall
supply
him
with
food
he
knows
that
it
means
strength
to
him
and
that
strength
means
happiness
as
a
rule
when
all
that
he
has
depends
upon
his
own
ability
to
keep
it
for
himself
he
does
not
reason
things
that
way
for
the
blackfellow
is
simple
but
he
just
eats
as
much
as
he
can
whenever
he
can
get
it
and
that
seems
to
agree
with
him
excellently
that
was
the
principle
on
which
had
been
brought
up
and
it
had
made
him
the
round
black
shiny
baby
that
he
had
been
until
his
parents
died
he
was
not
nearly
so
round
and
shiny
now
his
little
body
was
thin
and
hard
and
he
did
not
look
so
strong
as
before
it
was
not
altogether
lack
of
food
that
had
weakened
him
the
want
of
happiness
had
a
great
deal
to
do
with
it
he
had
found
out
that
the
tribe
did
not
like
him
not
only
was
he
nobody
boy
but
he
was
the
object
of
a
kind
of
distrust
that
he
could
feel
without
at
all
understanding
it
and
he
had
learnt
to
shrink
and
cringe
from
blows
and
bitter
words
once
he
had
found
a
asleep
on
a
rock
and
grasping
his
tiny
waddy
had
stolen
up
to
it
very
carefully
all
the
instinct
of
the
hunter
blazing
in
his
dark
sad
eyes
the
lizard
when
it
woke
was
quick
but
was
quicker
the
stick
came
down
with
all
the
force
of
his
arm
and
he
carried
off
his
prey
in
triumph
meaning
to
ask
a
woman
who
had
sometimes
been
kind
to
him
if
she
would
cook
it
for
him
but
just
outside
the
camp
three
big
boys
had
come
upon
him
as
he
was
carrying
his
prey
and
that
had
been
the
last
that
had
seen
of
his
lizard
he
had
fought
for
it
like
a
little
tiger
quite
hopelessly
of
course
but
to
fight
had
been
a
kind
of
dismal
satisfaction
to
him
even
though
he
was
badly
beaten
in
addition
to
losing
his
dinner
and
that
was
specially
unfortunate
for
blacks
think
lizard
a
very
great
delicacy
indeed
the
boys
ran
off
with
it
jeering
at
the
sobbing
little
figure
on
the
ground
and
they
called
him
names
that
even
in
his
angry
soreness
made
him
think
they
said
something
to
do
with
an
evil
spirit
he
pondered
over
it
creeping
into
a
clump
of
bushes
why
should
they
call
him
that
blacks
always
want
a
reason
for
any
happening
sometimes
they
are
satisfied
with
very
foolish
reasons
but
they
must
have
something
to
explain
occurrences
especially
if
they
are
unpleasant
ones
the
sickness
that
had
fallen
on
their
tribe
they
put
down
to
bori
as
the
told
them
but
when
the
sickness
had
gone
it
seemed
only
reasonable
to
believe
that
bori
was
satisfied
and
would
leave
them
alone
for
awhile
so
they
could
not
understand
why
misfortune
should
still
pursue
them
another
tribe
had
stolen
part
of
their
country
and
they
had
been
too
weakened
by
the
sickness
to
fight
for
it
and
now
had
come
the
drought
making
food
harder
than
ever
to
obtain
and
causing
some
of
the
babies
to
fall
sick
and
die
they
turned
to
the
or
sorcerers
for
explanation
and
these
clever
people
performed
a
great
many
extraordinary
tricks
to
make
things
better
then
as
they
were
really
hard
up
for
some
object
on
which
to
throw
the
blame
of
their
failure
it
occurred
to
them
to
turn
suspicion
towards
little
went
on
with
his
unhappy
little
life
quite
ignorant
of
the
storms
gathering
round
his
woolly
head
no
one
was
ever
kind
to
him
and
he
could
scarcely
distinguish
one
day
from
another
although
he
gathered
a
vague
idea
that
in
some
way
they
were
linking
his
name
with
the
evil
spirit
he
did
not
understand
what
that
meant
he
kept
on
hunting
round
for
food
and
water
and
dodging
blows
and
angry
faces
if
he
had
guessed
that
the
were
busily
persuading
the
people
that
his
family
and
he
were
the
cause
of
the
terrible
year
through
which
they
had
passed
he
might
have
been
more
uneasy
but
in
any
case
he
was
only
a
very
little
boy
and
perhaps
he
would
not
have
understood
he
had
enough
troubles
to
think
of
without
looking
out
for
more
chapter
iii
then
the
worst
part
of
the
drought
happened
for
the
creek
began
to
run
dry
day
after
day
it
ran
a
little
more
slowly
and
the
deep
holes
at
the
bends
shrank
and
dwindled
away
the
fish
disappeared
completely
having
swum
to
where
deeper
waters
awaited
them
and
so
another
source
of
food
was
lost
to
the
tribe
there
only
remained
the
black
and
soon
it
was
hard
to
find
any
of
these
try
as
they
might
that
was
bad
but
it
was
nothing
in
comparison
to
the
loss
of
the
water
supply
without
the
creek
the
tribe
could
not
exist
for
the
only
other
in
their
country
were
swamps
and
morasses
and
these
too
were
dried
up
and
useless
so
the
and
became
very
anxious
and
many
were
the
black
glances
cast
upon
the
unconscious
as
he
slunk
round
the
camp
or
hunted
for
food
in
the
scrub
then
the
issued
a
command
that
no
one
should
drink
from
the
creek
itself
lest
the
little
water
remaining
should
be
stirred
up
and
made
muddy
or
lest
anyone
should
drink
too
much
instead
of
going
to
the
creek
to
drink
they
were
permitted
to
fill
their
tarnuks
or
each
morning
and
then
no
one
was
allowed
to
approach
the
creek
again
that
day
so
in
the
mornings
a
long
procession
of
women
went
down
to
the
bank
where
a
watched
them
fill
the
tarnuks
remaining
until
the
last
had
hurried
away
very
much
afraid
of
his
fierce
eyes
but
the
new
law
fell
very
heavily
on
for
he
had
now
no
tarnuk
the
little
one
made
for
him
by
his
father
long
ago
had
disappeared
when
he
lost
everything
and
since
then
he
had
always
been
accustomed
to
drink
at
the
creek
now
however
he
could
not
do
so
and
no
one
would
give
him
a
tarnuk
or
let
him
drink
from
theirs
he
would
have
stolen
it
very
readily
for
he
was
now
not
at
all
a
little
boy
but
the
tarnuks
were
hung
far
beyond
his
reach
of
course
the
knew
how
the
new
law
would
affect
the
little
fellow
they
knew
that
now
it
would
be
impossible
for
to
drink
and
after
a
little
he
would
and
be
dead
and
then
perhaps
the
evil
spirit
would
be
satisfied
and
go
away
from
the
tribe
they
watched
him
carefully
and
were
glad
that
he
became
weak
and
wretched
they
had
uttered
such
savage
penalties
against
drinking
from
the
creek
that
it
never
occurred
to
them
that
he
would
dare
to
disobey
but
sometimes
in
the
darkness
used
to
creep
down
for
a
drink
being
indeed
as
desperate
as
a
boy
can
be
and
quite
sure
that
unless
he
went
he
must
die
and
he
had
become
so
stealthy
in
his
movements
that
he
was
never
caught
it
did
not
satisfy
his
thirst
of
course
for
it
was
the
hottest
part
of
the
summer
and
all
the
blacks
were
accustomed
to
drinking
a
great
deal
still
it
was
something
at
least
it
kept
him
alive
then
one
morning
came
news
of
a
number
of
kangaroo
feeding
two
miles
away
by
the
creek
and
all
the
camp
fell
into
a
state
of
tremendous
excitement
at
the
very
idea
of
such
a
chance
of
food
all
the
men
and
big
boys
dashed
off
at
once
and
presently
the
women
made
up
their
minds
that
they
would
follow
them
as
it
was
not
at
all
unlikely
that
if
the
men
had
good
luck
in
their
hunt
they
might
immediately
sit
down
and
eat
a
great
portion
of
the
game
they
had
killed
in
which
case
there
was
only
a
poor
for
those
left
in
camp
so
they
gathered
up
their
and
sticks
slung
the
babies
on
their
backs
and
ran
off
into
the
bush
after
the
men
leaving
the
camp
deserted
now
it
chanced
that
knew
nothing
of
all
this
he
had
not
spent
the
night
in
camp
because
on
the
evening
before
he
had
been
savagely
beaten
by
two
big
boys
who
had
caught
him
alone
in
the
scrub
and
when
they
had
finished
with
him
he
was
too
sick
and
sore
to
crawl
back
to
the
wurleys
he
had
crept
under
a
bush
and
slept
there
uneasily
for
the
pain
of
his
bruises
kept
waking
him
up
the
sun
was
quite
high
in
the
sky
before
he
made
up
his
mind
to
go
back
to
the
camp
in
the
faint
hope
that
some
one
would
give
him
food
so
he
limped
slowly
through
the
bush
wincing
when
the
harsh
boughs
rubbed
against
his
sore
limbs
he
stopped
at
the
edge
of
the
camp
and
rubbed
his
fists
into
his
eyes
blinking
in
surprise
no
one
was
in
sight
instead
of
the
hum
and
bustle
of
the
camp
the
men
sitting
about
carving
their
spears
and
the
women
chattering
round
the
wurleys
the
babies
rolling
on
the
ground
and
playing
with
the
dogs
there
was
only
desolation
and
silence
he
approached
one
hut
after
another
and
poked
in
a
timid
head
but
he
saw
no
one
and
the
stillness
seemed
almost
terrible
to
him
then
in
a
corner
of
one
wurley
he
saw
a
and
from
it
came
a
smell
that
would
have
been
disgusting
to
anyone
but
a
black
but
was
pure
delight
to
his
fear
vanished
as
he
seized
upon
the
food
and
ate
it
ravenously
he
came
out
presently
his
thin
little
body
not
nearly
so
hollow
as
before
and
looked
about
him
the
food
had
made
him
feel
better
but
he
was
terribly
thirsty
and
then
he
saw
with
a
little
glad
shout
that
all
about
the
camp
were
brimming
with
water
put
down
wherever
their
owners
had
happened
to
be
when
they
had
rushed
away
to
the
hunt
did
not
know
anything
about
that
of
course
he
only
knew
that
here
was
water
enough
to
make
him
forget
that
he
had
ever
been
thirsty
he
ran
eagerly
to
the
nearest
tarnuk
and
drank
and
drank
until
he
could
drink
no
more
and
with
that
drink
so
the
blacks
say
a
great
change
came
upon
little
put
down
the
tarnuk
and
stood
upright
throwing
his
head
back
in
sheer
bodily
happiness
at
once
more
having
had
enough
to
eat
and
drink
all
his
bruises
and
soreness
had
suddenly
gone
he
was
no
longer
tired
and
lonely
and
unhappy
but
strong
and
well
and
glad
how
wonderfully
strong
he
felt
a
new
feeling
ran
through
all
his
body
i
am
stronger
than
anybody
ever
was
before
he
said
aloud
and
he
believed
that
it
was
true
he
glanced
round
the
deserted
camp
it
was
quiet
now
but
he
felt
sure
that
soon
the
blacks
would
come
hurrying
back
perhaps
they
would
be
there
in
a
moment
listened
half
dreading
to
hear
the
quick
of
bare
feet
over
the
hard
baked
ground
no
sound
came
but
he
knew
that
they
would
return
and
then
what
would
await
him
his
new
strength
seemed
to
burn
him
he
stretched
his
arms
out
wondering
at
their
hard
muscles
although
he
felt
that
the
drink
had
been
magic
and
so
he
need
not
wonder
at
anything
at
all
some
good
spirit
perhaps
sorry
for
lonely
little
boys
had
evidently
come
to
help
him
fear
suddenly
left
him
altogether
and
with
its
going
came
a
mighty
desire
for
revenge
he
did
not
know
what
he
was
going
to
do
but
the
new
power
that
was
in
him
urged
him
on
a
little
tree
grew
in
front
of
him
he
began
to
gather
up
all
the
and
one
by
one
to
hang
them
upon
the
boughs
there
were
very
many
and
it
took
a
long
time
but
at
last
the
task
was
completed
and
not
a
tarnuk
was
left
in
the
camp
he
looked
in
the
wurleys
and
found
many
empty
vessels
and
these
also
he
hung
up
in
the
tree
then
he
took
the
biggest
tarnuk
of
all
and
a
little
tarnuk
and
went
down
to
the
creek
and
with
the
little
tarnuk
he
filled
the
big
one
dipping
up
all
the
water
from
the
creek
until
there
was
none
left
there
was
much
water
yet
still
the
big
tarnuk
held
it
all
and
only
the
mud
of
the
remained
where
the
stream
had
been
rippling
past
even
as
he
looked
that
grew
dry
and
hard
then
turned
and
carried
his
burden
up
the
bank
to
his
tree
and
from
the
big
tarnuk
he
filled
all
the
empty
ones
they
held
a
great
deal
and
yet
the
big
tarnuk
remained
quite
full
for
now
there
was
magic
in
everything
that
touched
he
climbed
up
into
the
little
tree
and
seated
himself
comfortably
in
a
fork
where
he
could
see
everything
and
yet
lean
back
comfortably
a
quiver
ran
through
the
tree
as
if
something
far
underground
had
shaken
it
and
suddenly
it
began
to
grow
it
grew
and
grew
spreading
wide
arms
to
the
sky
until
it
was
as
large
as
very
many
big
trees
all
put
together
and
its
trunk
was
tall
and
straight
and
very
smooth
all
the
time
sat
in
the
fork
and
smiled
when
the
tree
had
finished
growing
he
heard
a
sound
of
voices
far
below
him
and
looking
down
he
saw
the
tribe
hurrying
back
through
the
scrub
to
their
camp
their
hunt
had
been
unsuccessful
for
all
the
kangaroo
had
got
away
into
the
country
of
another
tribe
where
they
dared
not
follow
so
they
were
returning
hungry
and
thirsty
and
in
a
very
bad
temper
for
they
had
not
found
any
water
in
the
places
where
they
had
been
they
came
angrily
back
to
the
camp
and
from
his
seat
in
the
fork
of
the
great
tree
looked
down
at
them
and
smiled
the
blacks
were
far
too
thirsty
to
look
up
at
any
tree
they
hurried
to
the
wurleys
then
the
first
said
where
is
my
tarnuk
and
another
said
wah
my
tarnuk
has
gone
and
a
third
who
has
taken
all
our
tarnuks
they
became
very
angry
and
beat
their
wives
because
they
could
find
no
and
no
water
then
becoming
desperate
because
of
their
thirst
they
hurried
to
the
creek
and
lo
the
creek
was
dry
they
came
back
from
the
creek
jabbering
and
afraid
believing
that
the
evil
spirits
had
done
this
wonderful
thing
presently
one
saw
the
big
tree
and
cried
out
in
astonishment
ky
what
tree
is
that
he
exclaimed
they
gathered
round
staring
in
amazement
at
the
huge
tree
and
so
they
saw
all
their
tarnuks
hanging
in
its
branches
and
little
sitting
smiling
in
the
fork
wah
is
that
you
they
called
have
you
any
water
yes
here
am
i
and
i
have
plenty
of
water
said
but
i
will
not
give
you
one
drop
because
you
would
give
me
none
although
i
died
of
thirst
some
threatened
him
and
some
begged
of
him
and
the
women
and
children
wailed
round
the
base
of
the
tree
but
smiled
down
at
them
and
took
no
heed
of
all
their
anger
and
their
crying
then
a
couple
of
young
men
took
their
tomahawks
of
stone
and
began
to
climb
the
tree
although
they
were
afraid
because
it
was
so
big
still
thirst
drove
them
and
so
they
came
up
the
tree
cutting
notches
for
their
fingers
and
toes
in
the
smooth
trunk
and
coming
wonderfully
quickly
but
laughed
and
let
fall
a
little
water
on
them
from
a
tarnuk
and
as
soon
as
the
water
touched
them
they
fell
to
the
ground
and
were
killed
again
and
again
other
men
tried
to
climb
the
tree
becoming
desperate
with
their
own
thirst
and
the
crying
of
the
women
and
children
but
always
they
met
the
same
fate
always
smiled
and
splashed
a
few
drops
of
water
upon
them
only
a
drop
on
each
of
them
but
as
the
drops
touched
them
their
hold
loosened
the
grip
of
their
toes
relaxed
and
they
fell
from
the
great
height
to
meet
their
death
on
the
ground
below
so
it
went
on
until
nearly
all
the
men
of
the
tribe
were
gone
and
sat
in
the
fork
of
the
tree
and
smiled
and
it
still
went
on
all
through
the
moonlit
night
but
in
the
dawn
two
men
came
back
from
hunting
and
the
sons
of
maker
of
men
they
were
very
cunning
as
well
as
being
very
brave
and
after
they
had
taken
counsel
together
they
began
to
climb
the
tree
but
they
did
not
climb
as
the
other
men
had
done
straight
up
the
long
line
of
the
smooth
trunk
instead
they
climbed
round
and
round
as
the
clematis
creeps
when
it
throws
its
tendrils
about
a
branch
laughed
just
as
he
had
laughed
at
the
others
and
waited
until
they
had
ascended
to
a
great
height
then
he
took
water
and
let
it
fall
but
the
men
were
no
longer
in
the
same
place
but
on
the
other
side
climbing
round
and
round
and
he
missed
them
again
and
again
he
ran
to
get
more
and
poured
it
down
they
were
very
quick
circling
about
the
trunk
and
always
managed
to
escape
the
falling
drops
they
came
to
the
place
where
the
trunk
forked
and
swung
themselves
into
the
high
boughs
then
little
began
to
cry
in
a
terrified
voice
but
they
seized
him
not
heeding
and
beat
him
until
all
his
bones
were
broken
and
then
threw
him
down
the
other
blacks
uttered
a
great
shout
of
triumph
and
ran
to
kill
him
but
the
magic
that
had
helped
him
came
to
the
aid
of
little
once
more
and
so
he
did
not
die
suddenly
just
as
the
angry
blacks
were
upon
him
with
uplifted
waddies
and
threatening
faces
he
changed
under
their
gaze
and
where
there
had
been
a
little
black
boy
there
lay
for
a
moment
a
native
bear
his
grey
fur
bristling
and
fear
filling
his
soft
eyes
then
very
swiftly
he
gathered
himself
up
and
ran
up
a
tree
until
he
was
out
of
sight
among
the
branches
just
then
the
blacks
were
too
thirsty
to
pursue
him
overhead
and
were
cutting
at
the
branches
of
the
great
tree
that
held
the
tarnuks
and
all
the
water
came
out
and
flowed
back
to
the
creek
and
again
the
creek
became
wide
and
clear
running
swiftly
in
its
bed
so
that
there
was
drink
for
all
then
and
came
down
to
the
ground
and
the
tribe
hailed
them
as
heroes
but
when
they
looked
for
little
the
native
bear
he
had
fled
into
another
tree
and
had
disappeared
from
that
time
the
native
bears
became
food
for
the
black
people
but
it
is
law
that
they
must
not
break
their
bones
when
they
kill
them
nor
must
they
take
off
their
skin
before
they
cook
them
so
they
take
them
carefully
hitting
them
on
the
head
and
they
cook
them
by
roasting
them
whole
in
an
oven
of
stones
sunk
in
the
ground
if
the
law
were
broken
would
again
become
powerful
the
say
and
the
first
thing
he
would
do
would
be
to
dry
up
all
the
creeks
now
lives
near
the
creeks
and
water
holes
so
that
if
the
people
broke
the
law
he
might
at
once
carry
away
the
water
he
is
not
very
wise
because
he
was
only
quite
a
little
boy
before
he
became
a
native
bear
and
so
had
not
much
time
to
gain
wisdom
but
he
is
soft
and
fat
and
gentle
unless
you
interfere
with
him
when
he
wants
to
climb
a
tree
and
then
he
can
scratch
very
hard
with
his
sharp
claws
all
he
can
do
is
to
climb
and
he
does
not
see
very
well
in
the
daytime
therefore
he
thinks
that
whatever
he
meets
is
a
tree
and
at
once
he
tries
to
climb
it
if
the
blacks
throw
things
at
him
when
he
is
sitting
in
the
fork
of
a
tree
he
blinks
down
at
them
and
sometimes
you
might
think
he
smiles
but
if
they
climb
his
tree
and
come
near
to
knock
him
down
he
cries
always
very
terribly
just
as
he
cried
long
ago
when
he
was
magic
and
and
climbed
his
great
tree
and
threw
him
to
the
people
far
below
xiii
wurip
the
chapter
i
once
there
was
a
time
when
the
blacks
had
no
fire
they
had
not
learned
the
way
to
make
it
by
rubbing
two
sticks
together
or
if
they
had
once
known
the
way
they
had
forgotten
it
and
they
were
very
miserable
for
it
was
often
cold
and
wintry
and
they
had
no
fire
to
warm
them
nor
any
way
of
cooking
food
fire
had
been
theirs
once
but
there
came
two
women
upon
the
earth
strange
women
speaking
in
unknown
tongues
with
great
eyes
in
which
there
was
no
fear
they
did
not
love
the
blacks
they
lived
in
their
camps
for
a
time
and
built
for
themselves
a
wurley
coming
and
going
as
they
pleased
but
always
there
was
hatred
in
their
wild
eyes
and
the
blacks
feared
them
exceedingly
because
they
feared
them
although
they
hated
them
they
gave
them
food
and
the
women
cooked
it
for
themselves
for
at
that
time
the
fire
blossomed
at
the
door
of
every
hut
but
one
day
the
blacks
awoke
to
find
the
women
gone
they
had
gone
in
the
night
silently
and
with
them
they
took
all
the
fire
that
the
blacks
had
there
was
not
even
a
coal
left
to
start
the
for
the
shivering
people
the
made
haste
to
arm
themselves
and
started
in
pursuit
of
the
women
they
travelled
through
swamps
and
morasses
across
boggy
lands
and
creeks
fringed
with
reeds
and
sedges
all
the
time
seeing
nothing
of
the
women
but
knowing
that
they
were
on
the
right
track
by
the
faint
smell
of
fire
that
still
hung
in
the
air
they
have
gone
this
way
carrying
fire
they
said
soon
we
shall
overtake
them
and
they
pressed
on
going
faster
and
faster
as
the
smell
of
burning
wood
became
stronger
and
stronger
at
last
they
came
out
upon
a
little
open
space
and
looking
across
it
they
saw
a
new
wurley
made
of
bushes
interlaced
with
reeds
in
front
of
it
smoke
curled
up
lazily
and
they
caught
the
gleam
of
red
coals
and
yellow
flame
the
two
women
sat
by
the
fire
motionless
the
broke
into
a
run
shouting
now
we
will
make
an
end
of
these
women
they
cried
fiercely
to
each
other
as
they
ran
gripping
their
spears
and
the
women
sat
by
the
fire
taking
no
heed
so
little
did
they
seem
to
notice
the
running
warriors
that
it
seemed
that
they
did
not
see
them
or
if
they
did
see
them
they
cared
no
more
than
for
a
line
of
black
swans
flying
westward
into
the
sunset
one
stirred
the
fire
gently
and
laid
across
the
red
embers
a
dried
stick
of
the
other
weaved
a
mat
of
rushes
in
a
curious
device
of
green
and
white
and
as
she
twisted
them
in
and
out
she
smiled
even
when
the
long
shout
of
the
sent
its
echoes
rolling
round
the
sky
they
did
not
look
up
the
glow
of
the
flames
shone
reflected
deep
in
their
eyes
so
the
came
on
grim
and
relentless
burning
with
the
anger
of
all
their
long
chase
and
the
hot
desire
for
revenge
they
tightened
their
grip
on
their
waddies
since
there
was
nothing
to
be
gained
by
risking
a
or
a
spear
when
the
enemy
to
be
slain
was
only
two
women
weak
and
unarmed
for
such
defenceless
creatures
a
blow
with
a
waddy
would
be
sufficient
but
half
a
spear
cast
from
the
wurley
something
they
could
not
see
brought
them
to
a
sudden
gasping
halt
it
was
as
though
a
wall
were
there
soft
and
invisible
but
yet
a
wall
they
could
not
touch
it
to
climb
over
it
neither
could
they
force
their
way
through
they
struck
at
it
and
it
was
as
if
their
sticks
struck
the
empty
air
there
was
nothing
to
see
but
the
wurley
and
the
fire
and
the
quiet
women
and
the
air
was
clear
and
bright
but
no
step
farther
could
they
advance
they
circled
about
the
camp
trying
at
every
step
to
get
nearer
to
the
wurley
it
was
all
to
no
purpose
always
the
wall
met
them
though
they
could
not
see
it
so
they
came
back
to
the
point
whence
they
had
started
breathless
angry
and
a
little
afraid
they
were
brave
men
and
used
to
battle
but
it
is
easier
to
fight
a
visible
enemy
than
one
that
lurks
unseen
in
the
air
it
was
magic
and
they
knew
it
still
their
anger
burned
furiously
within
them
and
one
lifted
a
spear
tipped
with
poisoned
bone
and
flung
it
at
the
women
to
see
him
lift
his
hand
was
enough
for
the
band
a
storm
of
spears
went
hurtling
through
the
air
for
a
few
yards
the
spears
flew
straight
and
true
but
then
they
stopped
suddenly
in
as
though
an
unseen
wall
had
met
them
for
a
moment
they
seemed
to
hang
in
the
air
then
they
fell
in
a
jangling
heap
among
the
tussocks
and
beyond
them
while
the
terrified
warriors
shrank
together
gesticulating
and
trembling
the
women
laid
more
sticks
upon
the
fire
and
smiled
the
were
cunning
and
they
did
not
give
in
easily
not
only
were
they
smarting
with
the
fury
of
defeat
but
the
tale
was
not
one
they
wished
to
carry
back
to
the
tribe
lest
they
should
become
a
even
to
the
women
and
young
boys
so
they
drew
off
thinking
under
cover
of
night
to
renew
the
attack
in
the
hope
that
when
the
women
slept
their
magic
would
also
sleep
so
when
darkness
had
fallen
they
crept
up
again
on
noiseless
feet
but
the
invisible
wall
was
there
and
they
could
find
no
gap
in
its
circle
while
all
the
time
the
fire
burned
redly
before
the
wurley
and
the
women
sat
by
it
feeding
it
and
weaving
their
mats
of
white
and
green
at
length
the
warriors
became
weak
for
want
of
food
and
weary
of
the
useless
struggle
and
so
they
gave
up
the
fight
and
slowly
made
their
way
back
across
and
morass
to
the
tribe
that
waited
for
them
shivering
and
fireless
in
the
shadow
of
the
hills
great
and
bitter
were
the
lamentations
at
the
news
of
their
defeat
they
had
been
eagerly
watched
for
and
when
they
came
slowly
back
to
the
camp
trailing
their
spears
a
long
cry
of
angry
disappointment
rent
the
air
it
was
difficult
to
believe
their
story
who
could
imagine
a
wall
strong
enough
to
stop
warriors
yet
that
could
not
be
seen
so
they
found
themselves
coldly
looked
upon
and
their
wives
said
unpleasant
things
to
them
in
their
wurleys
that
night
quite
a
number
of
wives
had
sore
heads
next
morning
since
it
was
easier
to
deal
with
a
talkative
wife
by
means
of
a
waddy
than
by
argument
but
the
wives
had
the
last
word
for
all
that
and
the
small
boys
of
the
tribe
used
to
call
jeering
words
at
the
disgraced
warriors
from
the
safe
concealment
of
a
clump
of
dogwood
or
fern
meanwhile
there
was
no
cooked
food
the
tribe
was
very
far
from
being
happy
then
a
band
of
young
men
who
were
not
picked
warriors
but
were
anxious
to
distinguish
themselves
made
up
their
minds
that
they
would
go
forth
to
find
the
and
slay
them
and
bring
back
fire
to
the
tribe
they
were
very
young
men
and
so
they
were
confident
that
they
could
succeed
where
the
warriors
had
failed
and
for
at
least
a
week
before
they
started
they
went
about
the
camp
telling
every
one
how
they
meant
to
do
it
when
they
were
not
doing
this
or
singing
songs
about
the
great
deeds
they
meant
to
perform
and
very
queer
songs
they
were
they
were
polishing
their
weapons
and
making
new
ones
and
talking
together
at
a
great
rate
of
their
secret
plans
when
they
were
ready
at
last
they
painted
themselves
with
as
much
as
they
were
allowed
to
use
and
gathered
together
to
start
when
we
have
killed
the
they
said
to
the
tribe
some
of
us
will
turn
homewards
and
wait
here
and
there
along
the
way
then
the
others
will
run
with
the
and
as
they
grow
tired
those
that
have
gone
ahead
will
take
it
and
run
very
swiftly
back
to
you
in
three
days
the
tribe
will
be
cooking
food
with
the
fire
which
we
shall
bring
then
we
shall
get
married
and
have
wurleys
and
fires
of
our
own
all
the
blacks
listened
gravely
except
the
who
had
not
brought
back
anything
at
all
these
men
laughed
a
little
but
no
one
took
any
notice
of
their
laughter
because
they
had
failed
and
it
is
the
way
of
the
world
not
to
think
well
of
failures
the
girls
thought
the
band
of
young
warriors
wonderfully
noble
and
smiled
upon
them
a
great
deal
as
they
marched
out
of
the
camp
of
course
the
boys
were
much
too
proud
to
smile
back
again
but
then
the
girls
did
not
expect
them
to
and
were
quite
content
to
do
all
the
smiling
so
the
little
band
marched
off
with
a
great
flourish
and
the
bush
swallowed
them
up
may
they
come
back
soon
said
one
girl
as
she
and
her
companions
dug
for
yams
next
day
ay
said
the
others
we
are
weary
of
eating
things
which
are
not
cooked
i
am
weary
of
being
cold
said
one
there
is
but
one
rug
in
our
wurley
and
my
father
takes
it
always
there
will
be
great
feasting
and
joy
when
they
bring
fire
back
said
another
perhaps
some
of
us
will
be
married
too
and
they
laughed
and
made
fun
of
each
other
after
the
fashion
of
girls
of
any
colour
but
the
three
days
had
not
past
when
the
young
men
returned
and
when
they
came
they
sneaked
back
quietly
into
the
camp
and
tried
to
look
as
if
they
had
not
gone
at
all
they
had
washed
the
from
their
bodies
and
were
all
quite
anxious
to
work
very
hard
and
make
themselves
exceedingly
useful
to
the
older
men
nor
were
they
at
all
anxious
to
talk
they
gave
severe
blows
to
the
young
boys
who
clustered
round
them
clamouring
for
news
and
told
them
to
go
and
play
but
when
they
were
summoned
before
the
leaders
they
hung
their
heads
and
told
the
same
story
as
the
warriors
they
had
seen
the
they
said
and
they
still
sat
before
their
wurley
and
fed
the
fire
but
the
young
men
could
not
come
near
them
nor
could
any
of
their
weapons
reach
them
and
when
they
were
wearied
with
much
throwing
and
their
arms
had
grown
stiff
and
sore
a
great
fear
came
suddenly
upon
them
and
they
turned
and
fled
homeward
through
the
scrub
never
stopping
until
they
came
upon
the
huts
they
knew
now
they
were
very
much
ashamed
and
the
girls
mocked
at
them
but
the
warriors
shook
their
heads
understandingly
to
fight
is
no
good
they
said
unless
the
can
tell
us
how
to
beat
down
the
magic
wall
and
conquer
the
the
tribe
will
go
for
ever
without
fire
we
are
wonderfully
brave
but
we
can
not
fight
witchcraft
let
the
undertake
the
task
for
indeed
it
is
a
thing
beyond
the
power
of
simple
men
but
is
it
not
for
such
matters
that
we
keep
the
then
all
the
tribe
said
yes
that
is
what
we
have
been
thinking
all
along
and
they
looked
expectantly
at
the
demanding
that
they
should
at
once
accomplish
the
business
without
any
further
trouble
every
one
became
quite
pleased
and
hopeful
except
the
themselves
and
were
in
a
very
bad
temper
because
they
did
not
like
the
task
still
they
held
their
heads
high
and
made
little
of
the
matter
because
to
do
anything
else
would
have
been
imprudent
and
they
looked
as
wise
as
possible
a
thing
they
had
trained
themselves
to
do
whether
they
knew
anything
about
a
matter
or
not
all
kinds
of
wise
men
can
do
this
and
it
is
a
very
handy
habit
because
it
makes
people
think
them
even
wiser
than
they
are
they
went
away
by
themselves
with
dreadful
threats
of
what
might
happen
if
the
people
came
near
them
not
that
there
was
any
need
for
them
to
take
such
precautions
for
the
blacks
were
much
too
terrified
by
them
to
venture
near
when
they
were
working
any
kind
of
magic
a
great
deal
of
what
the
blacks
called
magic
would
seem
very
stupid
to
you
if
you
watched
it
now
but
they
all
believed
in
it
firmly
and
even
those
who
knew
that
they
deceived
others
still
thought
that
magic
was
a
real
thing
and
that
it
could
be
practised
upon
them
the
shut
themselves
up
for
a
time
and
then
they
told
the
men
that
they
had
made
themselves
into
crows
and
had
flown
over
to
watch
what
the
were
doing
as
all
the
tribe
believed
that
they
could
turn
themselves
into
any
animal
they
chose
and
be
invisible
nobody
thought
of
doubting
this
the
then
began
to
weave
spells
they
chopped
the
branches
from
a
young
tree
and
cleared
away
grass
and
sticks
in
a
circle
round
it
then
they
sharpened
the
end
of
the
trunk
and
drew
on
the
ground
the
figure
of
a
woman
with
the
lopped
tree
growing
out
of
her
chest
afterwards
they
rubbed
themselves
all
over
with
charcoal
and
grease
and
danced
and
sang
songs
round
the
tree
for
some
days
expecting
the
to
feel
their
magic
so
that
they
would
have
to
rise
from
their
camp
and
walk
as
if
in
a
sleep
to
the
place
of
the
dance
but
the
women
did
not
come
and
so
the
told
themselves
that
they
were
not
yet
strong
enough
meanwhile
the
tribe
clustered
some
distance
off
very
frightened
and
respectful
and
also
very
cold
illustration
they
rubbed
themselves
all
over
with
charcoal
and
grease
and
danced
and
sang
songs
round
the
tree
the
tried
other
plans
although
they
were
much
hampered
because
many
of
their
spells
needed
the
use
of
fire
and
there
was
none
to
be
had
they
tried
to
kill
the
women
by
pointing
magic
things
in
the
direction
of
their
camp
such
as
bones
and
pieces
of
which
were
believed
to
be
very
deadly
and
going
to
their
old
wurley
they
put
sharp
fragments
of
bone
in
any
footprints
they
could
find
thinking
that
the
women
would
fall
ill
and
become
very
lame
and
so
lose
their
power
but
nothing
happened
so
they
sent
one
of
their
number
secretly
through
the
bush
and
he
returned
to
tell
them
that
the
women
were
well
and
unharmed
and
that
the
invisible
wall
about
their
camp
was
just
as
strong
as
ever
then
the
knew
that
they
could
do
no
more
they
told
the
people
that
the
only
spells
that
would
conquer
the
were
spells
in
which
fire
formed
a
part
and
until
they
could
bring
them
fire
they
must
not
expect
to
be
freed
from
the
power
of
the
women
the
tribe
did
not
like
this
and
much
lamentation
went
up
but
they
were
much
too
afraid
of
the
to
object
openly
to
anything
they
did
chapter
ii
at
this
time
there
lived
in
the
tribe
a
man
called
wurip
he
was
not
a
lucky
man
once
in
a
big
tribal
fight
most
of
his
relations
had
been
killed
and
when
he
was
still
quite
a
young
man
his
wife
died
of
a
mysterious
sickness
before
they
had
been
married
very
long
then
one
night
he
tripped
and
fell
into
a
big
fire
burning
himself
terribly
he
got
better
but
his
left
arm
and
hand
were
quite
twisted
and
withered
and
were
of
very
little
use
to
him
had
he
been
a
different
kind
of
man
it
is
not
unlikely
that
he
would
have
been
killed
by
the
tribe
for
the
blacks
had
no
use
for
maimed
or
deformed
persons
but
wurip
was
strong
apart
from
his
twisted
arm
and
also
he
had
a
way
of
muttering
to
himself
that
rather
frightened
people
it
was
only
a
habit
but
the
blacks
were
always
afraid
of
what
they
could
not
understand
so
they
left
him
alone
he
lived
in
a
little
wurley
by
himself
and
though
he
was
lonely
and
would
have
liked
to
take
another
wife
he
knew
that
no
girl
would
want
a
man
whose
arm
and
hand
were
not
like
those
of
other
men
so
he
did
not
try
to
get
married
and
gradually
he
became
very
solitary
he
thought
the
other
men
disliked
him
and
he
would
go
away
by
himself
on
hunting
expeditions
and
wander
through
the
scrub
alone
although
he
was
half
a
cripple
he
soon
learned
to
know
the
bush
more
thoroughly
than
any
man
in
the
tribe
and
he
trained
his
shrivelled
arm
to
do
a
great
deal
although
at
first
it
had
seemed
that
it
must
be
useless
for
ever
the
other
blacks
at
first
gave
him
about
his
arm
but
he
did
not
like
them
and
his
eyes
were
so
fierce
that
they
did
not
let
him
hear
them
any
more
and
to
his
face
only
called
him
by
his
own
name
wurip
which
means
a
little
bird
now
wurip
loved
his
tribe
he
had
no
special
friends
in
it
which
was
partly
his
own
fault
for
he
had
grown
very
unsociable
but
he
was
proud
of
the
tribe
itself
because
it
was
brave
and
owned
good
country
and
had
been
successful
in
many
fights
it
made
him
sore
at
heart
to
see
it
suffering
from
the
want
of
fire
and
also
it
hurt
his
pride
that
it
should
have
been
beaten
by
women
so
he
made
up
his
mind
that
he
would
try
to
recover
fire
from
the
wicked
he
thought
about
it
for
a
long
time
and
laid
his
plans
very
carefully
one
day
he
left
the
camp
carrying
no
weapons
but
only
a
single
waddy
the
other
blacks
said
to
him
where
are
you
going
wurip
said
i
go
to
try
to
get
fire
back
you
they
said
a
little
man
and
crippled
that
is
very
funny
and
all
the
people
laughed
at
him
wurip
hesitated
and
a
gleam
came
into
his
eyes
so
quick
and
fierce
that
those
who
had
laughed
shrank
back
then
he
turned
on
his
heel
and
walked
off
into
the
scrub
and
the
blacks
said
let
him
go
he
is
mad
and
he
will
most
likely
be
killed
and
it
really
does
not
matter
he
is
not
much
use
into
the
wild
bush
wurip
went
taking
short
noiseless
strides
he
was
a
little
man
but
he
had
the
quick
movements
of
many
little
men
and
at
all
times
he
could
move
rapidly
through
the
bush
scarcely
making
a
sound
as
he
went
he
passed
through
the
scrub
and
came
to
boggy
lands
and
morasses
his
light
feet
carried
him
over
swamps
and
across
creeks
fringed
with
reeds
and
sedges
then
he
saw
a
light
curl
of
smoke
going
lazily
skywards
and
at
the
sight
his
heart
gave
a
leap
for
it
was
long
since
he
had
seen
fire
until
then
he
had
travelled
very
quickly
but
now
he
slackened
his
speed
and
went
slowly
across
the
plain
towards
the
camp
as
he
drew
near
he
could
see
them
sitting
in
front
of
the
wurley
and
weaving
their
rushes
they
did
not
look
up
as
he
came
and
he
advanced
so
near
them
that
he
began
to
think
that
the
magic
wall
could
be
there
no
longer
just
as
he
was
wondering
if
this
were
indeed
true
one
of
the
glanced
up
and
saw
him
and
almost
immediately
wurip
felt
some
invisible
object
blocking
his
way
and
knew
he
could
go
no
farther
he
stopped
and
burst
out
laughing
and
at
the
sound
of
his
merriment
the
other
glanced
up
sharply
from
her
weaving
and
the
first
one
paused
with
a
stick
of
wood
in
her
hand
and
looked
at
him
in
blank
astonishment
so
silent
was
the
place
that
wurip
shout
of
laughter
echoed
like
a
thunderclap
the
looked
at
the
little
black
figure
standing
among
the
harsh
tussocks
of
and
he
waved
to
them
with
his
withered
arm
but
they
took
no
further
notice
going
on
scornfully
with
their
work
wurip
had
expected
nothing
else
and
he
was
not
discouraged
he
began
collecting
sticks
and
brushwood
for
a
wurley
singing
as
he
went
about
his
work
in
full
view
of
the
two
women
he
made
no
further
attempt
to
get
through
the
invisible
wall
there
was
not
much
timber
about
and
to
find
suitable
material
for
his
wurley
was
a
difficult
task
he
walked
slowly
using
his
crippled
arm
very
little
because
he
hoped
that
the
women
would
be
less
careful
about
him
if
they
regarded
him
as
a
man
sometimes
he
felt
that
they
were
looking
at
him
and
then
he
would
work
with
particular
awkwardness
always
however
he
sang
and
went
about
with
a
merry
countenance
as
if
he
had
not
a
single
care
in
the
world
he
built
his
wurley
and
went
off
into
the
swamp
to
hunt
returning
with
some
lizards
and
grubs
and
a
duck
that
he
had
caught
just
as
it
settled
on
a
sedgy
pool
standing
a
little
way
back
from
the
wall
he
called
out
and
threw
the
duck
towards
the
fire
where
the
women
sat
but
it
fell
before
it
reached
them
meeting
the
unseen
obstacle
what
a
pity
it
is
for
you
called
wurip
slowly
so
that
they
could
hear
easily
it
is
a
fat
duck
and
saying
this
he
laughed
again
and
went
into
his
wurley
where
he
ate
his
supper
contentedly
although
it
was
not
cooked
and
went
to
sleep
in
the
morning
the
women
were
sitting
as
before
but
the
duck
had
gone
and
looking
closely
across
the
little
space
wurip
saw
that
there
were
feathers
lying
about
near
their
fire
also
there
was
a
pleasant
smell
of
cooking
in
the
air
this
gladdened
his
heart
for
it
showed
that
the
women
did
not
mind
making
him
useful
and
that
was
exactly
what
he
wanted
so
the
days
went
by
and
wurip
lived
in
his
wurley
and
the
women
in
theirs
he
never
saw
them
away
from
it
neither
did
he
try
any
more
to
go
near
it
from
time
to
time
he
made
them
friendly
signals
or
called
cheerful
greetings
to
them
but
that
was
all
each
day
he
went
hunting
and
good
luck
always
attended
him
because
it
was
the
time
when
waterfowl
are
plentiful
and
as
no
others
hunted
there
the
birds
were
not
afraid
it
was
quite
easy
to
fill
the
bag
he
had
made
out
of
rushes
and
each
evening
he
put
the
best
of
the
game
on
a
big
stone
some
distance
from
his
wurley
and
in
the
morning
it
was
always
gone
this
went
on
for
fourteen
days
when
he
was
not
hunting
wurip
lay
about
his
camp
always
singing
contentedly
as
he
carved
himself
boomerangs
or
whittled
heads
for
that
he
never
used
once
he
carved
a
bowl
from
a
root
that
he
found
and
this
also
he
put
on
the
stone
for
the
and
they
took
it
he
gathered
bundles
of
the
rushes
that
women
of
the
tribes
use
in
weaving
and
left
them
too
so
that
he
became
very
useful
to
them
although
he
had
never
heard
their
voices
then
after
fourteen
days
wurip
pretended
that
he
had
fallen
sick
he
did
not
go
out
hunting
any
more
neither
did
he
place
offerings
upon
the
big
stone
in
his
wurley
he
had
hidden
sufficient
food
for
himself
to
last
him
for
several
days
but
he
did
not
let
the
see
him
eating
instead
he
crawled
out
dragging
himself
along
the
ground
and
cried
out
sorrowfully
waving
his
withered
arm
to
them
he
crawled
back
into
his
wurley
and
ate
and
slept
but
they
did
not
come
as
he
had
hoped
they
would
next
day
he
did
not
go
out
into
the
open
at
all
he
kept
close
within
his
wurley
and
all
the
exercise
he
took
was
to
groan
very
mournfully
he
groaned
nearly
all
day
and
by
the
time
it
was
evening
he
was
more
tired
than
if
he
had
hunted
for
three
days
because
he
was
tired
he
ate
nearly
all
that
remained
of
his
food
after
which
he
felt
discouraged
for
he
realized
that
it
would
soon
be
necessary
to
go
out
hunting
again
and
he
wanted
to
seem
ill
so
he
groaned
more
loudly
than
ever
and
once
or
twice
cried
out
as
if
in
pain
then
he
fell
asleep
the
were
fierce
creatures
but
still
they
were
women
it
troubled
them
that
this
crippled
little
blackfellow
should
be
ill
too
ill
to
bring
them
gifts
or
to
busy
himself
singing
and
laughing
about
his
camp
to
sit
over
a
fire
and
weave
mats
of
white
and
green
may
in
time
become
dull
and
it
cheered
the
women
to
see
wurip
and
listen
to
his
songs
when
he
did
not
appear
they
took
counsel
together
agreeing
that
so
small
a
fellow
with
a
withered
arm
could
not
be
dangerous
so
in
the
morning
wurip
heard
steps
and
opening
his
eyes
he
saw
one
of
the
women
entering
his
wurley
he
almost
jumped
up
then
remembering
he
groaned
heavily
and
looked
at
her
with
a
stupid
stare
she
spoke
to
him
asking
what
was
the
matter
but
he
only
moaned
in
answer
so
she
picked
him
up
it
was
not
difficult
for
she
was
very
powerful
and
wurip
was
quite
light
and
carried
him
over
to
where
her
sister
sat
there
seemed
to
be
no
invisible
wall
now
the
walked
to
the
fire
and
put
wurip
down
before
it
he
nearly
shouted
it
was
so
long
since
he
had
been
near
a
fire
but
luckily
he
remembered
to
turn
the
shout
into
a
groan
for
some
days
wurip
pretended
to
be
very
ill
and
the
nursed
him
not
in
the
harsh
fashion
of
the
but
in
gentler
manner
feeding
him
and
giving
him
a
comfortable
bed
to
lie
on
wurip
was
only
too
glad
to
lie
still
and
be
fed
and
it
was
not
hard
for
him
to
pretend
to
be
ill
because
being
black
he
was
not
required
to
look
pale
moreover
to
taste
cooked
food
once
more
nearly
made
him
weep
with
joy
he
was
very
grateful
to
the
and
told
them
that
he
was
an
outcast
from
the
tribe
because
of
his
crippled
arm
and
he
begged
that
when
he
grew
better
they
would
allow
him
to
serve
them
the
were
not
sorry
to
have
a
servant
getting
food
and
firewood
was
not
very
entertaining
for
them
and
the
gathering
of
rushes
was
a
long
and
laborious
task
which
they
hated
there
could
they
thought
be
no
risk
in
taking
so
harmless
a
person
as
wurip
to
work
for
them
still
they
were
stern
with
him
they
told
him
that
when
he
was
well
he
must
live
in
his
own
wurley
and
only
come
near
theirs
when
it
was
necessary
also
they
assured
him
that
if
he
were
unfaithful
to
them
their
magic
would
strike
him
dead
immediately
this
made
wurip
think
very
hard
for
he
did
not
want
to
meet
such
an
unpleasant
fate
although
he
was
quite
determined
to
take
fire
back
to
his
tribe
he
showed
great
horror
at
the
idea
of
being
unfaithful
and
when
he
thought
it
was
prudent
to
get
better
he
recovered
his
strength
not
too
quickly
for
it
was
very
pleasant
to
be
nursed
and
then
began
his
duties
the
found
him
an
excellent
servant
he
was
always
at
hand
when
he
was
wanted
and
he
did
his
work
well
there
was
plenty
of
food
at
all
times
and
very
long
fine
rushes
that
he
found
when
he
was
hunting
far
from
the
camp
wood
he
brought
also
but
the
would
never
allow
him
to
go
near
the
fire
he
laid
the
sticks
at
a
little
distance
away
and
they
tended
the
fire
and
cooked
the
food
giving
him
a
share
altogether
they
were
very
happy
and
comfortable
and
if
he
had
been
able
to
forget
the
shivering
tribe
wurip
would
have
been
content
although
he
was
only
a
servant
he
was
less
lonely
than
he
had
been
in
the
company
of
the
other
blacks
the
were
stern
with
him
but
they
never
made
him
remember
that
his
arm
was
crippled
and
when
he
had
been
with
the
tribe
he
could
not
forget
for
an
instant
that
he
was
different
to
the
others
sometimes
in
the
evenings
as
he
lay
in
his
wurley
the
thought
came
to
him
that
it
would
be
better
to
forget
the
tribe
and
stay
with
the
after
all
they
were
good
to
him
in
their
fierce
fashion
and
he
remembered
that
he
had
very
little
to
look
forward
to
in
returning
to
the
big
camp
even
if
he
took
back
the
fire
they
might
be
grateful
to
him
for
a
little
while
but
he
would
never
be
as
the
other
men
were
and
then
memory
would
come
to
him
bringing
back
pictures
of
the
tribe
half
starved
and
shivering
of
the
little
children
who
were
dying
for
want
of
proper
food
and
warmth
and
of
the
cold
of
his
people
however
they
might
treat
him
he
could
not
forget
that
they
were
his
own
people
he
knew
that
he
must
go
back
to
them
chapter
iii
wurip
lay
on
his
back
in
the
shade
of
a
golden
wattle
and
listened
idly
to
the
bush
voices
talking
round
him
he
heard
far
more
than
you
would
ever
hear
voices
of
whispering
leaves
and
boughs
of
rustling
grass
and
bodies
not
a
grasshopper
could
brush
through
a
tussock
but
wurip
knew
that
it
had
passed
overhead
birds
were
twittering
gaily
in
the
branches
he
knew
them
all
had
he
been
hungry
he
might
have
wanted
to
set
snares
for
some
of
the
little
chirping
things
but
just
then
he
was
too
and
lazy
to
trouble
about
such
tiny
morsels
he
bit
long
lazily
and
tried
to
sleep
a
pair
of
jays
flew
into
a
tree
close
by
and
began
to
chatter
to
each
other
and
suddenly
wurip
found
that
he
knew
what
they
were
saying
somehow
it
did
not
seem
surprising
that
he
should
know
afterwards
he
wondered
if
he
had
dreamed
it
but
at
the
moment
nothing
was
strange
to
him
the
jays
eager
and
chattering
did
not
notice
the
little
black
figure
in
the
grass
they
were
too
full
of
their
subject
the
have
nearly
finished
their
weaving
said
one
soon
the
last
mat
will
be
done
they
have
worked
very
quickly
since
wurip
brought
them
rushes
and
then
they
will
go
away
said
the
other
yes
then
they
will
go
quite
away
and
there
will
be
no
more
fire
for
ever
what
would
the
tribe
say
and
wurip
yes
wurip
also
what
will
he
do
when
they
have
gone
he
will
go
back
to
his
people
i
suppose
he
can
not
go
with
the
i
think
brother
said
the
smaller
jay
that
they
mean
to
sail
away
on
their
mats
to
another
country
taking
fire
with
them
certainly
they
mean
to
go
and
to
take
fire
with
them
did
we
not
hear
them
talking
about
it
while
we
perched
on
their
wurley
said
the
other
as
for
sailing
away
on
their
mats
i
do
not
see
now
that
can
be
mats
are
not
like
wings
you
are
a
foolish
young
bird
well
why
do
they
make
them
so
strong
and
large
and
how
else
will
they
get
away
asked
the
other
looking
down
his
beak
in
an
abashed
way
out
still
sticking
to
his
point
you
can
not
tell
me
those
things
i
do
not
care
to
know
said
the
big
jay
and
that
was
untrue
because
jays
are
very
inquisitive
what
does
it
matter
they
are
only
humans
but
wonder
what
wurip
would
say
if
he
knew
wurip
thinks
he
will
take
fire
back
to
the
tribe
but
i
do
not
think
he
will
ever
get
it
the
watch
him
too
closely
and
anyhow
he
is
only
a
little
cripple
he
would
be
excited
if
he
knew
what
we
heard
them
say
that
if
they
lost
any
of
it
now
all
the
rest
would
go
out
and
then
their
power
would
leave
them
so
that
they
could
work
no
more
magic
chattered
the
other
jay
but
he
will
never
know
that
they
do
not
talk
when
he
is
near
no
they
are
wise
it
is
a
very
foolish
thing
to
talk
said
his
brother
solemnly
yet
they
chattered
for
a
little
while
longer
and
then
they
flew
away
wurip
lay
motionless
under
the
and
forgot
to
bite
any
more
he
was
not
sure
whether
he
was
awake
or
dreaming
and
he
did
not
greatly
care
because
he
felt
that
the
warning
that
had
come
to
him
was
true
whether
he
had
dreamed
it
or
not
it
fitted
in
with
little
things
he
had
noticed
lately
the
had
been
very
busy
at
their
weaving
working
night
and
day
so
that
he
could
hardly
bring
them
rushes
quickly
enough
a
great
pile
of
mats
lay
ready
in
a
corner
of
their
wurley
and
now
they
were
working
together
at
the
largest
of
all
they
had
seemed
restless
and
excited
too
and
talked
earnestly
together
although
they
were
careful
not
to
let
him
hear
anything
and
never
to
let
him
go
near
the
fire
not
that
they
seemed
to
fear
now
that
he
would
try
to
approach
it
wurip
had
been
very
careful
never
even
glancing
towards
it
as
he
worked
about
the
camp
he
was
allowed
to
place
his
firewood
at
a
certain
spot
and
took
great
pains
not
to
go
beyond
it
in
every
way
in
his
power
he
used
to
try
to
make
them
think
that
he
was
afraid
of
fire
and
dreaded
to
go
too
close
to
it
since
he
had
burned
his
arm
by
this
means
he
seemed
to
have
put
their
suspicions
to
sleep
and
they
regarded
him
as
a
harmless
little
fellow
of
whom
they
need
have
no
fear
he
made
his
way
back
to
the
camp
slowly
thinking
hard
if
the
were
really
going
away
he
must
act
and
act
quickly
at
any
time
they
might
finish
their
work
and
then
they
would
disappear
for
ever
and
there
would
be
no
more
fire
to
warm
the
people
of
the
earth
wurip
drew
up
his
thin
little
body
as
he
walked
and
clenched
his
fist
he
made
up
his
mind
that
he
would
act
that
very
night
he
found
the
camp
just
as
usual
with
the
working
at
their
greatest
mat
of
all
weaving
it
in
and
out
in
a
curious
device
of
green
and
white
one
held
the
white
strands
and
the
other
the
green
and
their
black
hands
worked
so
quickly
that
wurip
could
scarcely
see
to
which
woman
they
belonged
he
looked
at
it
with
great
admiration
and
ventured
a
timid
word
of
praise
then
he
went
a
little
way
off
and
began
to
skin
the
native
cats
and
bandicoots
that
he
had
brought
home
when
he
had
prepared
them
for
cooking
he
laid
them
carefully
on
crossed
sticks
and
put
them
in
a
shady
corner
it
was
growing
dusk
and
he
hurried
off
to
find
firewood
all
the
time
he
was
turning
many
plans
over
and
over
in
his
mind
and
rejecting
one
after
another
as
useless
well
he
thought
he
must
trust
to
luck
he
came
back
to
the
camp
with
his
bundle
of
wood
and
began
to
heap
it
in
the
accustomed
place
keeping
a
respectful
distance
from
the
fire
and
bending
down
his
eyes
lest
their
burning
desire
should
be
seen
already
the
sun
had
gone
away
over
the
edge
of
the
world
and
darkness
was
coming
fast
the
had
been
forced
to
stop
weaving
for
the
pattern
of
the
great
mat
was
too
fine
to
weave
by
firelight
generally
when
they
had
finished
one
carried
the
work
into
the
wurley
while
the
other
remained
outside
to
watch
wurip
and
begin
the
cooking
but
the
great
mat
was
now
too
heavy
for
one
to
lift
and
so
they
rolled
it
up
and
carried
it
away
together
wurip
crouching
over
his
heap
of
firewood
felt
his
body
suddenly
stiffened
like
a
steel
spring
under
his
brows
he
watched
them
and
as
the
wurley
hid
them
he
darted
forward
snatched
a
big
from
the
glowing
coals
and
fled
with
great
noiseless
bounds
that
carried
him
in
a
moment
far
into
the
dusk
behind
him
he
heard
a
sudden
loud
anguished
cry
and
knew
that
the
had
found
out
his
theft
for
a
moment
he
feared
that
the
magic
wall
would
spring
up
to
bar
his
way
and
he
ran
as
he
had
never
run
before
but
it
did
not
come
and
into
his
mind
swept
the
words
of
the
jay
that
if
fire
were
taken
from
the
women
they
would
lose
their
power
of
magic
he
hardly
dared
to
think
that
could
be
so
but
as
he
ran
on
finding
no
unseen
obstacle
in
his
way
hope
surged
over
him
magic
was
a
thing
against
which
no
man
could
fight
but
if
he
had
only
ordinary
women
to
deal
with
he
was
not
afraid
a
few
hundred
yards
from
the
wurley
he
glanced
back
and
saw
that
their
fire
no
longer
sent
its
red
gleam
into
the
dusk
his
heart
leapt
with
joy
for
it
seemed
as
if
the
jays
story
must
be
true
and
if
so
the
hearth
was
cold
and
already
the
only
fire
in
the
world
was
what
he
carried
the
greatness
of
the
thought
caught
his
breath
surely
such
an
honour
should
be
for
the
bravest
warrior
of
the
tribe
and
not
for
a
undersized
weakling
like
him
and
behind
him
came
a
sudden
trampling
of
running
feet
and
a
cry
of
such
terrible
anger
that
the
very
waterfowl
in
the
swamps
hid
themselves
in
fear
the
were
on
his
track
wurip
ran
forward
leaping
from
tussock
to
tussock
sometimes
slipping
into
and
scratching
his
bare
limbs
on
great
clumps
of
in
his
withered
hand
he
clutched
the
the
other
held
his
waddy
and
sometimes
he
was
glad
to
use
it
to
help
himself
over
rough
places
luckily
he
knew
the
ground
well
there
was
no
part
of
it
that
he
had
not
studied
on
his
days
out
hunting
knowing
that
at
any
time
he
might
have
to
make
his
dash
for
home
he
hid
the
glow
of
the
as
much
as
he
could
holding
it
so
close
to
him
that
his
skin
was
scorched
by
it
but
his
precautions
could
not
conceal
it
altogether
and
to
the
behind
him
it
was
like
a
red
star
twinkling
low
down
upon
earth
they
came
after
wurip
swiftly
at
first
they
had
uttered
savage
cries
of
wrath
and
fierce
threats
of
what
they
would
do
to
wurip
when
they
caught
him
but
soon
it
seemed
that
they
knew
that
shouts
and
threats
were
useless
and
after
that
they
hunted
him
silently
only
the
quick
pad
of
their
feet
being
heard
in
the
darkness
they
were
terribly
quick
feet
wurip
had
not
dreamed
that
women
could
run
so
fast
sometimes
as
the
moon
rose
he
could
see
them
in
pursuit
grim
and
revengeful
looking
like
giants
in
the
darkness
his
soul
was
full
of
terror
at
the
thought
of
what
they
would
do
if
they
caught
him
for
he
knew
that
he
would
be
but
a
little
child
in
their
hands
they
crossed
the
swamps
and
morasses
and
the
creeks
and
here
wurip
lost
ground
for
he
had
to
go
very
carefully
lest
he
should
slip
and
so
drown
the
precious
that
he
held
close
to
him
only
a
blackfellow
could
have
kept
it
alight
so
long
but
wurip
knew
just
how
to
hold
it
so
that
the
air
fanned
it
enough
to
keep
the
dull
coals
glowing
without
letting
it
burn
too
quickly
away
he
heard
the
splash
through
the
creeks
not
far
behind
him
then
they
came
into
the
all
running
at
their
wildest
speed
for
this
was
the
last
part
of
the
journey
back
to
the
tribe
then
wurip
knew
that
he
must
be
beaten
he
was
nearly
done
his
breath
came
unevenly
and
his
limbs
were
like
lead
and
would
no
longer
do
his
bidding
fierce
and
untired
close
behind
him
came
the
a
little
ahead
he
knew
of
a
bed
of
green
bracken
fern
in
a
gully
and
he
set
his
teeth
in
the
resolve
to
get
thus
far
they
were
quite
near
him
when
the
dark
line
of
the
gully
showed
somewhat
to
his
left
he
threw
all
his
remaining
strength
into
a
last
spurt
of
energy
and
then
turning
from
the
straight
line
towards
the
camp
of
the
tribe
he
crept
through
the
scrub
to
the
gully
holding
both
hands
over
the
fire
so
that
it
might
not
guide
the
to
his
place
of
refuge
and
heedless
of
the
cruel
burning
he
reached
the
gully
safely
and
flung
himself
face
downwards
among
the
rank
ferns
and
nettles
panting
as
if
his
heart
would
burst
from
his
body
he
heard
the
women
run
past
tirelessly
swift
there
came
to
him
their
angry
voices
calling
softly
lest
they
should
miss
each
other
in
the
dim
scrub
they
had
not
seen
him
swerve
that
was
clear
and
wurip
hugged
himself
with
joy
to
think
that
for
the
moment
he
was
safe
when
they
had
passed
and
the
sound
of
their
feet
had
died
away
he
crept
from
his
gully
and
fled
in
a
northerly
direction
he
ran
all
through
the
dark
hours
with
long
trotting
strides
as
a
dingo
runs
and
circling
round
so
that
he
might
miss
the
and
come
upon
the
camp
from
the
other
side
sometimes
he
paused
to
rest
listening
for
the
sound
of
the
other
hastening
feet
but
they
did
not
come
and
at
last
he
believed
that
he
had
escaped
pursuit
he
was
very
tired
so
tired
that
at
last
he
lost
something
of
the
blackfellow
keenness
that
guides
him
through
even
unknown
country
in
the
dark
something
seemed
to
have
broken
in
his
chest
from
the
time
of
his
last
mad
spurt
from
the
and
now
each
breath
stabbed
him
perhaps
it
was
because
he
was
so
tired
that
at
last
he
became
confused
altogether
and
swerved
from
the
track
he
had
mapped
out
for
himself
to
get
back
to
the
camp
and
when
dawn
broke
he
was
back
in
the
direction
where
he
might
expect
to
meet
pursuit
even
as
this
dawned
upon
him
he
looked
up
and
saw
the
running
silently
towards
him
their
fierce
eyes
gleaming
wurip
knew
it
was
the
end
he
fled
knowing
as
he
went
that
he
could
not
run
far
behind
him
came
the
women
tireless
as
though
they
had
not
spent
the
night
in
fruitless
chase
he
clutched
the
to
him
scarcely
knowing
that
it
burned
his
hands
and
his
naked
chest
rounding
a
clump
of
saplings
a
sob
burst
from
his
labouring
chest
before
him
he
saw
the
familiar
camp
the
wurleys
clustered
together
it
seemed
to
smile
at
him
in
fashion
so
near
home
to
fail
he
spurred
himself
to
the
last
effort
then
from
the
camp
burst
a
knot
of
racing
towards
him
he
caught
the
glint
of
the
rising
sun
on
their
spears
and
and
he
waved
to
them
for
he
could
not
shout
they
came
on
with
great
strides
there
was
music
in
the
sound
of
their
trampling
feet
when
they
came
to
him
they
divided
running
past
him
and
wurip
staggered
through
the
lane
they
formed
he
heard
fierce
cries
and
blows
behind
him
but
he
did
not
stop
before
him
the
camp
lay
and
never
had
it
smiled
to
him
a
welcome
so
sweet
there
were
people
running
out
to
meet
him
men
women
and
little
children
he
could
hear
their
voices
amazed
and
rejoicing
wurip
it
is
wurip
bringing
us
fire
he
tried
to
smile
at
them
but
his
lips
would
not
move
so
he
staggered
in
to
the
circle
of
the
huts
and
there
fell
upon
his
face
still
grasping
the
red
in
his
blistered
hand
it
was
all
red
now
for
it
had
burned
down
to
the
last
few
inches
then
as
they
clustered
round
him
lifting
him
with
gentle
hands
and
blessing
his
name
he
smiled
at
them
a
little
and
died
peacefully
happy
that
he
had
brought
back
fire
to
his
own
people
but
to
the
people
he
did
not
die
ever
after
they
honoured
his
name
calling
him
the
benefactor
of
the
tribe
so
that
in
death
he
found
that
honour
that
forgot
he
had
ever
been
little
and
weak
and
a
cripple
and
when
you
see
the
little
finch
that
hops
about
so
fearlessly
with
the
bright
red
feathers
making
a
patch
of
flame
on
its
sober
plumage
you
are
looking
at
wurip
the
who
gave
his
life
to
vanquish
the
wicked
and
to
lay
fire

of
