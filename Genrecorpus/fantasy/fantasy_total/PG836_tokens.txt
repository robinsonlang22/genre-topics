chapter
the
egg
it
began
with
the
day
when
it
was
almost
the
fifth
of
november
and
a
doubt
arose
in
some
breast
robert
s
i
fancy
as
to
the
quality
of
the
fireworks
laid
in
for
the
guy
fawkes
celebration
they
were
jolly
cheap
said
whoever
it
was
and
i
think
it
was
robert
and
suppose
they
didn
t
go
off
on
the
night
those
prosser
kids
would
have
something
to
snigger
about
the
ones
got
are
all
right
jane
said
i
know
they
are
because
the
man
at
the
shop
said
they
were
worth
thribble
the
money
i
m
sure
thribble
isn
t
grammar
anthea
said
of
course
it
isn
t
said
cyril
one
word
can
t
be
grammar
all
by
itself
so
you
needn
t
be
so
jolly
anthea
was
rummaging
in
the
of
her
mind
for
a
very
disagreeable
answer
when
she
remembered
what
a
wet
day
it
was
and
how
the
boys
had
been
disappointed
of
that
ride
to
london
and
back
on
the
top
of
the
tram
which
their
mother
had
promised
them
as
a
reward
for
not
having
once
forgotten
for
six
whole
days
to
wipe
their
boots
on
the
mat
when
they
came
home
from
school
so
anthea
only
said
don
t
be
so
jolly
clever
yourself
squirrel
and
the
fireworks
look
all
right
and
you
ll
have
the
eightpence
that
your
tram
fares
didn
t
cost
to
buy
something
more
with
you
ought
to
get
a
perfectly
lovely
catharine
wheel
for
i
daresay
said
cyril
coldly
but
it
s
not
your
eightpence
anyhow
but
look
here
said
robert
really
now
about
the
fireworks
we
don
t
want
to
be
disgraced
before
those
kids
next
door
they
think
because
they
wear
red
plush
on
sundays
no
one
else
is
any
i
wouldn
t
wear
plush
if
it
was
ever
so
unless
it
was
black
to
be
beheaded
in
if
i
was
mary
queen
of
scots
said
anthea
with
scorn
robert
stuck
steadily
to
his
point
one
great
point
about
robert
is
the
steadiness
with
which
he
can
stick
i
think
we
ought
to
test
them
he
said
you
young
duffer
said
cyril
fireworks
are
like
you
can
only
use
them
what
do
you
suppose
it
means
by
carter
s
tested
seeds
in
the
advertisement
there
was
a
blank
silence
then
cyril
touched
his
forehead
with
his
finger
and
shook
his
head
a
little
wrong
here
he
said
i
was
always
afraid
of
that
with
poor
robert
all
that
cleverness
you
know
and
being
top
in
algebra
so
often
it
s
bound
to
tell
dry
up
said
robert
fiercely
don
t
you
see
you
can
t
test
seeds
if
you
do
them
all
you
just
take
a
few
here
and
there
and
if
those
grow
you
can
feel
pretty
sure
the
others
will
be
what
do
you
call
it
father
told
me
up
to
sample
don
t
you
think
we
ought
to
sample
the
just
shut
our
eyes
and
each
draw
one
out
and
then
try
but
it
s
raining
cats
and
dogs
said
jane
and
queen
anne
is
dead
rejoined
robert
no
one
was
in
a
very
good
temper
we
needn
t
go
out
to
do
them
we
can
just
move
back
the
table
and
let
them
off
on
the
old
we
play
toboggans
with
i
don
t
know
what
you
think
but
think
it
s
time
we
did
something
and
that
would
be
really
useful
because
then
we
shouldn
t
just
hope
the
fireworks
would
make
those
prossers
sit
up
we
should
it
would
be
something
to
do
cyril
owned
with
languid
approval
so
the
table
was
moved
back
and
then
the
hole
in
the
carpet
that
had
been
near
the
window
till
the
carpet
was
turned
round
showed
most
awfully
but
anthea
stole
out
on
and
got
the
tray
when
cook
wasn
t
looking
and
brought
it
in
and
put
it
over
the
hole
then
all
the
fireworks
were
put
on
the
table
and
each
of
the
four
children
shut
its
eyes
very
tight
and
put
out
its
hand
and
grasped
something
robert
took
a
cracker
cyril
and
anthea
had
roman
candles
but
jane
s
fat
paw
closed
on
the
gem
of
the
whole
collection
the
that
had
cost
two
shillings
and
one
at
least
of
the
party
i
will
not
say
which
because
it
was
sorry
afterwards
declared
that
jane
had
done
it
on
purpose
nobody
was
pleased
for
the
worst
of
it
was
that
these
four
children
with
a
very
proper
dislike
of
anything
even
faintly
bordering
on
the
sneakish
had
a
law
unalterable
as
those
of
the
medes
and
persians
that
one
had
to
stand
by
the
results
of
a
or
a
drawing
of
lots
or
any
other
appeal
to
chance
however
much
one
might
happen
to
dislike
the
way
things
were
turning
out
i
didn
t
mean
to
said
jane
near
tears
i
don
t
care
i
ll
draw
another
you
know
jolly
well
you
can
t
said
cyril
bitterly
it
s
settled
it
s
medium
and
persian
you
ve
done
it
and
you
ll
have
to
stand
by
it
and
us
too
worse
luck
never
mind
you
ll
have
your
before
the
fifth
anyway
we
ll
have
the
last
and
get
the
most
out
of
it
we
so
the
cracker
and
the
roman
candles
were
lighted
and
they
were
all
that
could
be
expected
for
the
money
but
when
it
came
to
the
it
simply
sat
in
the
tray
and
laughed
at
them
as
cyril
said
they
tried
to
light
it
with
paper
and
they
tried
to
light
it
with
matches
they
tried
to
light
it
with
vesuvian
fusees
from
the
pocket
of
father
s
overcoat
that
was
hanging
in
the
hall
and
then
anthea
slipped
away
to
the
cupboard
under
the
stairs
where
the
brooms
and
dustpans
were
kept
and
the
rosiny
that
smell
so
nice
and
like
the
woods
where
grow
and
the
old
newspapers
and
the
and
turpentine
and
the
horrid
an
stiff
dark
rags
that
are
used
for
cleaning
brass
and
furniture
and
the
paraffin
for
the
lamps
she
came
back
with
a
little
pot
that
had
once
cost
when
it
was
full
of
jelly
but
the
jelly
had
been
all
eaten
long
ago
and
now
anthea
had
filled
the
jar
with
paraffin
she
came
in
and
she
threw
the
paraffin
over
the
tray
just
at
the
moment
when
cyril
was
trying
with
the
match
to
light
the
the
did
not
catch
fire
any
more
than
usual
but
the
paraffin
acted
quite
differently
and
in
an
instant
a
hot
flash
of
flame
leapt
up
and
burnt
off
cyril
s
eyelashes
and
scorched
the
faces
of
all
four
before
they
could
spring
back
they
backed
in
four
instantaneous
bounds
as
far
as
they
could
which
was
to
the
wall
and
the
pillar
of
fire
reached
from
floor
to
ceiling
my
hat
said
cyril
with
emotion
you
ve
done
it
this
time
the
flame
was
spreading
out
under
the
ceiling
like
the
rose
of
fire
in
mr
rider
haggard
s
exciting
story
about
allan
quatermain
robert
and
cyril
saw
that
no
time
was
to
be
lost
they
turned
up
the
edges
of
the
carpet
and
kicked
them
over
the
tray
this
cut
off
the
column
of
fire
and
it
disappeared
and
there
was
nothing
left
but
smoke
and
a
dreadful
smell
of
lamps
that
have
been
turned
too
low
all
hands
now
rushed
to
the
rescue
and
the
paraffin
fire
was
only
a
bundle
of
trampled
carpet
when
suddenly
a
sharp
crack
beneath
their
feet
made
the
amateur
firemen
start
back
another
crack
the
carpet
moved
as
if
it
had
had
a
cat
wrapped
in
it
the
had
at
last
allowed
itself
to
be
lighted
and
it
was
going
off
with
desperate
violence
inside
the
carpet
robert
with
the
air
of
one
doing
the
only
possible
thing
rushed
to
the
window
and
opened
it
anthea
screamed
jane
burst
into
tears
and
cyril
turned
the
table
wrong
way
up
on
top
of
the
carpet
heap
but
the
firework
went
on
banging
and
bursting
and
spluttering
even
underneath
the
table
next
moment
mother
rushed
in
attracted
by
the
howls
of
anthea
and
in
a
few
moments
the
firework
desisted
and
there
was
a
dead
silence
and
the
children
stood
looking
at
each
other
s
black
faces
and
out
of
the
corners
of
their
eyes
at
mother
s
white
one
the
fact
that
the
nursery
carpet
was
ruined
occasioned
but
little
surprise
nor
was
any
one
really
astonished
that
bed
should
prove
the
immediate
end
of
the
adventure
it
has
been
said
that
all
roads
lead
to
rome
this
may
be
true
but
at
any
rate
in
early
youth
i
am
quite
sure
that
many
roads
lead
to
bed
and
stop
there
or
you
do
the
rest
of
the
fireworks
were
confiscated
and
mother
was
not
pleased
when
father
let
them
off
himself
in
the
back
garden
though
he
said
well
how
else
can
you
get
rid
of
them
my
dear
you
see
father
had
forgotten
that
the
children
were
in
disgrace
and
that
their
bedroom
windows
looked
out
on
to
the
back
garden
so
that
they
all
saw
the
fireworks
most
beautifully
and
admired
the
skill
with
which
father
handled
them
next
day
all
was
forgotten
and
forgiven
only
the
nursery
had
to
be
deeply
cleaned
like
and
the
ceiling
had
to
be
whitewashed
and
mother
went
out
and
just
at
next
day
a
man
came
with
a
carpet
and
father
paid
him
and
mother
said
if
the
carpet
isn
t
in
good
condition
you
know
i
shall
expect
you
to
change
and
the
man
replied
there
ain
t
a
thread
gone
in
it
nowhere
mum
it
s
a
bargain
if
ever
there
was
one
and
i
m
more
n
arf
sorry
i
let
it
go
at
the
price
but
we
can
t
resist
the
lydies
can
we
sir
and
he
winked
at
father
and
went
away
then
the
carpet
was
put
down
in
the
nursery
and
sure
enough
there
wasn
t
a
hole
in
it
anywhere
as
the
last
fold
was
unrolled
something
hard
and
bumped
out
of
it
and
trundled
along
the
nursery
floor
all
the
children
scrambled
for
it
and
cyril
got
it
he
took
it
to
the
gas
it
was
shaped
like
an
egg
very
yellow
and
shiny
and
it
had
an
odd
sort
of
light
in
it
that
changed
as
you
held
it
in
different
ways
it
was
as
though
it
was
an
egg
with
a
yolk
of
pale
fire
that
just
showed
through
the
stone
i
may
keep
it
mayn
t
i
mother
cyril
asked
and
of
course
mother
said
no
they
must
take
it
back
to
the
man
who
had
brought
the
carpet
because
she
had
only
paid
for
a
carpet
and
not
for
a
stone
egg
with
a
fiery
yolk
to
it
so
she
told
them
where
the
shop
was
and
it
was
in
the
kentish
town
road
not
far
from
the
hotel
that
is
called
the
bull
and
gate
it
was
a
poky
little
shop
and
the
man
was
arranging
furniture
outside
on
the
pavement
very
cunningly
so
that
the
more
broken
parts
should
show
as
little
as
possible
and
directly
he
saw
the
children
he
knew
them
again
and
he
began
at
once
without
giving
them
a
chance
to
speak
no
you
don
t
he
cried
loudly
i
ain
t
to
take
back
no
carpets
so
don
t
you
make
no
bloomin
errer
a
bargain
s
a
bargain
and
the
carpet
s
puffik
we
don
t
want
you
to
take
it
back
said
cyril
but
we
found
something
in
it
must
have
got
into
it
up
at
your
place
then
said
the
man
with
indignant
promptness
for
there
ain
t
nothing
in
nothing
as
i
sell
it
s
all
as
clean
as
a
i
never
said
it
wasn
t
clean
said
cyril
but
oh
if
it
s
moths
said
the
man
that
s
easy
cured
with
borax
but
i
expect
it
was
only
an
odd
one
i
tell
you
the
carpet
s
good
through
and
through
it
hadn
t
got
no
moths
when
it
left
my
ands
not
so
much
as
an
but
that
s
just
it
interrupted
jane
there
was
so
much
as
an
the
man
made
a
sort
of
rush
at
the
children
and
stamped
his
foot
clear
out
i
say
he
shouted
or
i
ll
call
for
the
police
a
nice
thing
for
customers
to
ear
you
ere
me
with
finding
things
in
goods
what
i
sells
ere
be
off
afore
i
sends
you
off
with
a
flea
in
your
ears
hi
constable
the
children
fled
and
they
think
and
their
father
thinks
that
they
couldn
t
have
done
anything
else
mother
has
her
own
opinion
but
father
said
they
might
keep
the
egg
the
man
certainly
didn
t
know
the
egg
was
there
when
he
brought
the
carpet
said
he
any
more
than
your
mother
did
and
we
ve
as
much
right
to
it
as
he
so
the
egg
was
put
on
the
mantelpiece
where
it
quite
brightened
up
the
dingy
nursery
the
nursery
was
dingy
because
it
was
a
basement
room
and
its
windows
looked
out
on
a
stone
area
with
a
rockery
made
of
clinkers
facing
the
windows
nothing
grew
in
the
rockery
except
london
pride
and
snails
the
room
had
been
described
in
the
house
agent
s
list
as
a
convenient
in
basement
and
in
the
daytime
it
was
rather
dark
this
did
not
matter
so
much
in
the
evenings
when
the
gas
was
alight
but
then
it
was
in
the
evening
that
the
blackbeetles
got
so
sociable
and
used
to
come
out
of
the
low
cupboards
on
each
side
of
the
fireplace
where
their
homes
were
and
try
to
make
friends
with
the
children
at
least
i
suppose
that
was
what
they
wanted
but
the
children
never
would
on
the
fifth
of
november
father
and
mother
went
to
the
theatre
and
the
children
were
not
happy
because
the
prossers
next
door
had
lots
of
fireworks
and
they
had
none
they
were
not
even
allowed
to
have
a
bonfire
in
the
garden
no
more
playing
with
fire
thank
you
was
father
s
answer
when
they
asked
him
when
the
baby
had
been
put
to
bed
the
children
sat
sadly
round
the
fire
in
the
nursery
i
m
beastly
bored
said
robert
let
s
talk
about
the
psammead
said
anthea
who
generally
tried
to
give
the
conversation
a
cheerful
turn
what
s
the
good
of
talking
said
cyril
what
i
want
is
for
something
to
happen
it
s
awfully
stuffy
for
a
chap
not
to
be
allowed
out
in
the
evenings
there
s
simply
nothing
to
do
when
you
ve
got
through
your
jane
finished
the
last
of
her
and
shut
the
book
with
a
bang
we
ve
got
the
pleasure
of
memory
said
she
just
think
of
last
last
holidays
indeed
offered
something
to
think
of
for
they
had
been
spent
in
the
country
at
a
white
house
between
a
and
a
and
things
had
happened
the
children
had
found
a
psammead
or
and
it
had
let
them
have
anything
they
wished
for
just
exactly
anything
with
no
bother
about
its
not
being
really
for
their
good
or
anything
like
that
and
if
you
want
to
know
what
kind
of
things
they
wished
for
and
how
their
wishes
turned
out
you
can
read
it
all
in
a
book
called
five
children
and
it
it
was
the
psammead
if
you
ve
not
read
it
perhaps
i
ought
to
tell
you
that
the
fifth
child
was
the
baby
brother
who
was
called
the
lamb
because
the
first
thing
he
ever
said
was
baa
and
that
the
other
children
were
not
particularly
handsome
nor
were
they
extra
clever
nor
extraordinarily
good
but
they
were
not
bad
sorts
on
the
whole
in
fact
they
were
rather
like
you
i
don
t
want
to
think
about
the
pleasures
of
memory
said
cyril
i
want
some
more
things
to
we
re
very
much
luckier
than
any
one
else
as
it
is
said
jane
why
no
one
else
ever
found
a
psammead
we
ought
to
be
why
shouldn
t
we
go
on
being
though
cyril
asked
lucky
i
mean
not
grateful
why
s
it
all
got
to
stop
perhaps
something
will
happen
said
anthea
comfortably
do
you
know
sometimes
i
think
we
are
the
sort
of
people
that
things
do
happen
it
s
like
that
in
history
said
jane
some
kings
are
full
of
interesting
things
and
others
nothing
ever
happens
to
them
except
their
being
born
and
crowned
and
buried
and
sometimes
not
i
think
panther
s
right
said
cyril
i
think
we
are
the
sort
of
people
things
do
happen
to
i
have
a
sort
of
feeling
things
would
happen
right
enough
if
we
could
only
give
them
a
shove
it
just
wants
something
to
start
it
that
s
i
wish
they
taught
magic
at
school
jane
sighed
i
believe
if
we
could
do
a
little
magic
it
might
make
something
i
wonder
how
you
begin
robert
looked
round
the
room
but
he
got
no
ideas
from
the
faded
green
curtains
or
the
drab
venetian
blinds
or
the
worn
brown
on
the
floor
even
the
new
carpet
suggested
nothing
though
its
pattern
was
a
very
wonderful
one
and
always
seemed
as
though
it
were
just
going
to
make
you
think
of
something
i
could
begin
right
enough
said
anthea
i
ve
read
lots
about
it
but
i
believe
it
s
wrong
in
the
it
s
only
wrong
in
the
bible
because
people
wanted
to
hurt
other
people
i
don
t
see
how
things
can
be
wrong
unless
they
hurt
somebody
and
we
don
t
want
to
hurt
anybody
and
what
s
more
we
jolly
well
couldn
t
if
we
tried
let
s
get
the
ingoldsby
legends
there
s
a
thing
about
there
said
cyril
yawning
we
may
as
well
play
at
magic
let
s
be
knights
templars
they
were
awfully
gone
on
magic
they
used
to
work
spells
or
something
with
a
goat
and
a
goose
father
says
well
that
s
all
right
said
robert
unkindly
you
can
play
the
goat
right
enough
and
jane
knows
how
to
be
a
i
ll
get
ingoldsby
said
anthea
hastily
you
turn
up
the
so
they
traced
strange
figures
on
the
linoleum
where
the
hearthrug
had
kept
it
clean
they
traced
them
with
chalk
that
robert
had
nicked
from
the
top
of
the
mathematical
master
s
desk
at
school
you
know
of
course
that
it
is
stealing
to
take
a
new
stick
of
chalk
but
it
is
not
wrong
to
take
a
broken
piece
so
long
as
you
only
take
one
i
do
not
know
the
reason
of
this
rule
nor
who
made
it
and
they
chanted
all
the
gloomiest
songs
they
could
think
of
and
of
course
nothing
happened
so
then
anthea
said
i
m
sure
a
magic
fire
ought
to
be
made
of
wood
and
have
magic
gums
and
essences
and
things
in
i
don
t
know
any
wood
except
cedar
said
robert
but
i
ve
got
some
ends
of
lead
so
they
burned
the
ends
of
lead
pencil
and
still
nothing
happened
let
s
burn
some
of
the
eucalyptus
oil
we
have
for
our
colds
said
anthea
and
they
did
it
certainly
smelt
very
strong
and
they
burned
lumps
of
camphor
out
of
the
big
chest
it
was
very
bright
and
made
a
horrid
black
smoke
which
looked
very
magical
but
still
nothing
happened
then
they
got
some
clean
from
the
dresser
drawer
in
the
kitchen
and
waved
them
over
the
magic
and
sang
the
hymn
of
the
moravian
nuns
at
bethlehem
which
is
very
impressive
and
still
nothing
happened
so
they
waved
more
and
more
wildly
and
robert
s
caught
the
golden
egg
and
whisked
it
off
the
mantelpiece
and
it
fell
into
the
fender
and
rolled
under
the
grate
oh
crikey
said
more
than
one
voice
and
every
one
instantly
fell
down
flat
on
its
front
to
look
under
the
grate
and
there
lay
the
egg
glowing
in
a
nest
of
hot
ashes
it
s
not
smashed
anyhow
said
robert
and
he
put
his
hand
under
the
grate
and
picked
up
the
egg
but
the
egg
was
much
hotter
than
any
one
would
have
believed
it
could
possibly
get
in
such
a
short
time
and
robert
had
to
drop
it
with
a
cry
of
bother
it
fell
on
the
top
bar
of
the
grate
and
bounced
right
into
the
glowing
heart
of
the
fire
the
tongs
cried
anthea
but
alas
no
one
could
remember
where
they
were
every
one
had
forgotten
that
the
tongs
had
last
been
used
to
fish
up
the
doll
s
teapot
from
the
bottom
of
the
where
the
lamb
had
dropped
it
so
the
nursery
tongs
were
resting
between
the
and
the
dustbin
and
cook
refused
to
lend
the
kitchen
ones
never
mind
said
robert
we
ll
get
it
out
with
the
poker
and
the
oh
stop
cried
anthea
look
at
it
look
look
look
i
do
believe
something
is
going
to
happen
for
the
egg
was
now
and
inside
it
something
was
moving
next
moment
there
was
a
soft
cracking
sound
the
egg
burst
in
two
and
out
of
it
came
a
bird
it
rested
a
moment
among
the
flames
and
as
it
rested
there
the
four
children
could
see
it
growing
bigger
and
bigger
under
their
eyes
every
mouth
was
every
eye
the
bird
rose
in
its
nest
of
fire
stretched
its
wings
and
flew
out
into
the
room
it
flew
round
and
round
and
round
again
and
where
it
passed
the
air
was
warm
then
it
perched
on
the
fender
the
children
looked
at
each
other
then
cyril
put
out
a
hand
towards
the
bird
it
put
its
head
on
one
side
and
looked
up
at
him
as
you
may
have
seen
a
parrot
do
when
it
is
just
going
to
speak
so
that
the
children
were
hardly
astonished
at
all
when
it
said
be
careful
i
am
not
nearly
cool
they
were
not
astonished
but
they
were
very
very
much
interested
they
looked
at
the
bird
and
it
was
certainly
worth
looking
at
its
feathers
were
like
gold
it
was
about
as
large
as
a
bantam
only
its
beak
was
not
at
all
i
believe
i
know
what
it
is
said
robert
i
ve
seen
a
he
hurried
away
a
hasty
dash
and
scramble
among
the
papers
on
father
s
study
table
yielded
as
the
say
the
desired
result
but
when
he
came
back
into
the
room
holding
out
a
paper
and
crying
i
say
look
here
the
others
all
said
hush
and
he
hushed
obediently
and
instantly
for
the
bird
was
speaking
which
of
you
it
was
saying
put
the
egg
into
the
fire
he
did
said
three
voices
and
three
fingers
pointed
at
robert
the
bird
bowed
at
least
it
was
more
like
that
than
anything
else
i
am
your
grateful
debtor
it
said
with
a
air
the
children
were
all
choking
with
wonder
and
curiosity
all
except
robert
he
held
the
paper
in
his
hand
and
he
knew
he
said
so
he
said
know
who
you
and
he
opened
and
displayed
a
printed
paper
at
the
head
of
which
was
a
little
picture
of
a
bird
sitting
in
a
nest
of
flames
you
are
the
phoenix
said
robert
and
the
bird
was
quite
pleased
my
fame
has
lived
then
for
two
thousand
years
it
said
allow
me
to
look
at
my
it
looked
at
the
page
which
robert
kneeling
down
spread
out
in
the
fender
and
said
it
s
not
a
flattering
likeness
and
what
are
these
characters
it
asked
pointing
to
the
printed
part
oh
that
s
all
dullish
it
s
not
much
about
you
you
know
said
cyril
with
unconscious
politeness
but
you
re
in
lots
of
with
portraits
asked
the
phoenix
well
no
said
cyril
in
fact
i
don
t
think
i
ever
saw
any
portrait
of
you
but
that
one
but
i
can
read
you
something
about
yourself
if
you
the
phoenix
nodded
and
cyril
went
off
and
fetched
volume
x
of
the
old
encyclopedia
and
on
page
he
found
the
following
phoenix
in
ornithology
a
fabulous
bird
of
antiquity
is
quite
correct
said
the
phoenix
but
fabulous
well
do
i
look
it
every
one
shook
its
head
cyril
went
on
the
ancients
speak
of
this
bird
as
single
or
the
only
one
of
its
that
s
right
enough
said
the
phoenix
they
describe
it
as
about
the
size
of
an
eagles
are
of
different
sizes
said
the
phoenix
it
s
not
at
all
a
good
all
the
children
were
kneeling
on
the
hearthrug
to
be
as
near
the
phoenix
as
possible
you
ll
boil
your
brains
it
said
look
out
i
m
nearly
cool
now
and
with
a
whirr
of
golden
wings
it
fluttered
from
the
fender
to
the
table
it
was
so
nearly
cool
that
there
was
only
a
very
faint
smell
of
burning
when
it
had
settled
itself
on
the
it
s
only
a
very
little
scorched
said
the
phoenix
apologetically
it
will
come
out
in
the
wash
please
go
on
the
children
gathered
round
the
table
the
size
of
an
eagle
cyril
went
on
its
head
finely
crested
with
a
beautiful
plumage
its
neck
covered
with
feathers
of
a
gold
colour
and
the
rest
of
its
body
purple
only
the
tail
white
and
the
eyes
sparkling
like
stars
they
say
that
it
lives
about
five
hundred
years
in
the
wilderness
and
when
advanced
in
age
it
builds
itself
a
pile
of
sweet
wood
and
aromatic
gums
fires
it
with
the
wafting
of
its
wings
and
thus
burns
itself
and
that
from
its
ashes
arises
a
worm
which
in
time
grows
up
to
be
a
phoenix
hence
the
phoenicians
gave
never
mind
what
they
gave
said
the
phoenix
ruffling
its
golden
feathers
they
never
gave
much
anyway
they
always
were
people
who
gave
nothing
for
nothing
that
book
ought
to
be
destroyed
it
s
most
inaccurate
the
rest
of
my
body
was
never
purple
and
as
for
my
tail
well
i
simply
ask
you
is
it
white
it
turned
round
and
gravely
presented
its
golden
tail
to
the
children
no
it
s
not
said
everybody
no
and
it
never
was
said
the
phoenix
and
that
about
the
worm
is
just
a
vulgar
insult
the
phoenix
has
an
egg
like
all
respectable
birds
it
makes
a
pile
that
part
s
all
right
and
it
lays
its
egg
and
it
burns
itself
and
it
goes
to
sleep
and
wakes
up
in
its
egg
and
comes
out
and
goes
on
living
again
and
so
on
for
ever
and
ever
i
can
t
tell
you
how
weary
i
got
of
it
such
a
restless
existence
no
but
how
did
your
egg
get
here
asked
anthea
ah
that
s
my
said
the
phoenix
i
couldn
t
tell
it
to
any
one
who
wasn
t
really
sympathetic
i
ve
always
been
a
misunderstood
bird
you
can
tell
that
by
what
they
say
about
the
worm
i
might
tell
you
it
went
on
looking
at
robert
with
eyes
that
were
indeed
starry
you
put
me
on
the
fire
robert
looked
uncomfortable
the
rest
of
us
made
the
fire
of
woods
and
gums
though
said
cyril
and
and
it
was
an
accident
my
putting
you
on
the
fire
said
robert
telling
the
truth
with
some
difficulty
for
he
did
not
know
how
the
phoenix
might
take
it
it
took
it
in
the
most
unexpected
manner
your
candid
avowal
it
said
removes
my
last
scruple
i
will
tell
you
my
and
you
won
t
vanish
or
anything
sudden
will
you
asked
anthea
anxiously
why
it
asked
puffing
out
the
golden
feathers
do
you
wish
me
to
stay
here
oh
yes
said
every
one
with
unmistakable
sincerity
why
asked
the
phoenix
again
looking
modestly
at
the
because
said
every
one
at
once
and
then
stopped
short
only
jane
added
after
a
pause
you
are
the
most
beautiful
person
we
ve
ever
you
are
a
sensible
child
said
the
phoenix
and
i
will
not
vanish
or
anything
sudden
and
i
will
tell
you
my
tale
i
had
resided
as
your
book
says
for
many
thousand
years
in
the
wilderness
which
is
a
large
quiet
place
with
very
little
really
good
society
and
i
was
becoming
weary
of
the
monotony
of
my
existence
but
i
acquired
the
habit
of
laying
my
egg
and
burning
myself
every
five
hundred
years
and
you
know
how
difficult
it
is
to
break
yourself
of
a
yes
said
cyril
jane
used
to
bite
her
but
i
broke
myself
of
it
urged
jane
rather
hurt
you
know
i
not
till
they
put
bitter
aloes
on
them
said
cyril
i
doubt
said
the
bird
gravely
whether
even
bitter
aloes
the
aloe
by
the
way
has
a
bad
habit
of
its
own
which
it
might
well
cure
before
seeking
to
cure
others
i
allude
to
its
indolent
practice
of
flowering
but
once
a
century
i
doubt
whether
even
bitter
aloes
could
have
cured
me
but
i
was
cured
i
awoke
one
morning
from
a
feverish
dream
it
was
getting
near
the
time
for
me
to
lay
that
tiresome
fire
and
lay
that
tedious
egg
upon
it
and
i
saw
two
people
a
man
and
a
woman
they
were
sitting
on
a
carpet
and
when
i
accosted
them
civilly
they
narrated
to
me
their
which
as
you
have
not
yet
heard
it
i
will
now
proceed
to
relate
they
were
a
prince
and
princess
and
the
story
of
their
parents
was
one
which
i
am
sure
you
will
like
to
hear
in
early
youth
the
mother
of
the
princess
happened
to
hear
the
story
of
a
certain
enchanter
and
in
that
story
i
am
sure
you
will
be
interested
the
enchanter
oh
please
don
t
said
anthea
i
can
t
understand
all
these
beginnings
of
stories
and
you
seem
to
be
getting
deeper
and
deeper
in
them
every
minute
do
tell
us
your
own
story
that
s
what
we
really
want
to
well
said
the
phoenix
seeming
on
the
whole
rather
flattered
to
cut
about
seventy
long
stories
short
though
had
to
listen
to
them
all
but
to
be
sure
in
the
wilderness
there
is
plenty
of
time
this
prince
and
princess
were
so
fond
of
each
other
that
they
did
not
want
any
one
else
and
the
enchanter
don
t
be
alarmed
i
won
t
go
into
his
history
had
given
them
a
magic
carpet
you
ve
heard
of
a
magic
carpet
and
they
had
just
sat
on
it
and
told
it
to
take
them
right
away
from
every
one
and
it
had
brought
them
to
the
wilderness
and
as
they
meant
to
stay
there
they
had
no
further
use
for
the
carpet
so
they
gave
it
to
me
that
was
indeed
the
chance
of
a
lifetime
i
don
t
see
what
you
wanted
with
a
carpet
said
jane
when
you
ve
got
those
lovely
they
are
nice
wings
aren
t
they
said
the
phoenix
simpering
and
spreading
them
out
well
i
got
the
prince
to
lay
out
the
carpet
and
i
laid
my
egg
on
it
then
i
said
to
the
carpet
now
my
excellent
carpet
prove
your
worth
take
that
egg
somewhere
where
it
can
t
be
hatched
for
two
thousand
years
and
where
when
that
time
s
up
some
one
will
light
a
fire
of
sweet
wood
and
aromatic
gums
and
put
the
egg
in
to
hatch
and
you
see
it
s
all
come
out
exactly
as
i
said
the
words
were
no
sooner
out
of
my
beak
than
egg
and
carpet
disappeared
the
royal
lovers
assisted
to
arrange
my
pile
and
soothed
my
last
moments
i
burnt
myself
up
and
knew
no
more
till
i
awoke
on
yonder
it
pointed
its
claw
at
the
grate
but
the
carpet
said
robert
the
magic
carpet
that
takes
you
anywhere
you
wish
what
became
of
that
oh
that
said
the
phoenix
carelessly
i
should
say
that
that
is
the
carpet
i
remember
the
pattern
it
pointed
as
it
spoke
to
the
floor
where
lay
the
carpet
which
mother
had
bought
in
the
kentish
town
road
for
shillings
and
ninepence
at
that
instant
father
s
was
heard
in
the
door
oh
whispered
cyril
now
we
shall
catch
it
for
not
being
in
bed
wish
yourself
there
said
the
phoenix
in
a
hurried
whisper
and
then
wish
the
carpet
back
in
its
no
sooner
said
than
done
it
made
one
a
little
giddy
certainly
and
a
little
breathless
but
when
things
seemed
right
way
up
again
there
the
children
were
in
bed
and
the
lights
were
out
they
heard
the
soft
voice
of
the
phoenix
through
the
darkness
i
shall
sleep
on
the
cornice
above
your
curtains
it
said
please
don
t
mention
me
to
your
not
much
good
said
robert
they
d
never
believe
us
i
say
he
called
through
the
door
to
the
girls
talk
about
adventures
and
things
happening
we
ought
to
be
able
to
get
some
fun
out
of
a
magic
carpet
and
a
rather
said
the
girls
in
bed
children
said
father
on
the
stairs
go
to
sleep
at
once
what
do
you
mean
by
talking
at
this
time
of
night
no
answer
was
expected
to
this
question
but
under
the
bedclothes
cyril
murmured
one
mean
he
said
don
t
know
what
we
mean
i
don
t
know
what
anything
but
we
ve
got
a
magic
carpet
and
a
phoenix
said
robert
you
ll
get
something
else
if
father
comes
in
and
catches
you
said
cyril
shut
up
i
tell
robert
shut
up
but
he
knew
as
well
as
you
do
that
the
adventures
of
that
carpet
and
that
phoenix
were
only
just
beginning
father
and
mother
had
not
the
least
idea
of
what
had
happened
in
their
absence
this
is
often
the
case
even
when
there
are
no
magic
carpets
or
phoenixes
in
the
house
the
next
morning
but
i
am
sure
you
would
rather
wait
till
the
next
chapter
before
you
hear
about
that
chapter
the
topless
tower
the
children
had
seen
the
hatched
in
the
flames
in
their
own
nursery
grate
and
had
heard
from
it
how
the
carpet
on
their
own
nursery
floor
was
really
the
wishing
carpet
which
would
take
them
anywhere
they
chose
the
carpet
had
transported
them
to
bed
just
at
the
right
moment
and
the
phoenix
had
gone
to
roost
on
the
cornice
supporting
the
of
the
boys
room
excuse
me
said
a
gentle
voice
and
a
courteous
beak
opened
very
kindly
and
delicately
the
right
eye
of
cyril
i
hear
the
slaves
below
preparing
food
awaken
a
word
of
explanation
and
arrangement
i
do
wish
you
wouldn
t
the
phoenix
stopped
speaking
and
fluttered
away
crossly
to
the
for
cyril
had
hit
out
as
boys
do
when
they
are
awakened
suddenly
and
the
phoenix
was
not
used
to
boys
and
his
feelings
if
not
his
wings
were
hurt
sorry
said
cyril
coming
awake
all
in
a
minute
do
come
back
what
was
it
you
were
saying
something
about
bacon
and
rations
the
phoenix
fluttered
back
to
the
brass
rail
at
the
foot
of
the
bed
i
say
you
are
real
said
cyril
how
ripping
and
the
carpet
the
carpet
is
as
real
as
it
ever
was
said
the
phoenix
rather
contemptuously
but
of
course
a
carpet
s
only
a
carpet
whereas
a
phoenix
is
superlatively
a
yes
indeed
said
cyril
i
see
it
is
oh
what
luck
wake
up
bobs
there
s
jolly
well
something
to
wake
up
for
today
and
it
s
saturday
i
ve
been
reflecting
said
the
phoenix
during
the
silent
watches
of
the
night
and
i
could
not
avoid
the
conclusion
that
you
were
quite
insufficiently
astonished
at
my
appearance
yesterday
the
ancients
were
always
very
surprised
did
you
by
chance
expect
my
egg
to
hatch
not
us
cyril
said
and
if
we
had
said
anthea
who
had
come
in
in
her
nightie
when
she
heard
the
silvery
voice
of
the
phoenix
we
could
never
never
have
expected
it
to
hatch
anything
so
splendid
as
the
bird
smiled
perhaps
you
ve
never
seen
a
bird
smile
you
see
said
anthea
wrapping
herself
in
the
boys
counterpane
for
the
morning
was
chill
we
ve
had
things
happen
to
us
before
and
she
told
the
story
of
the
psammead
or
ah
yes
said
the
phoenix
psammeads
were
rare
even
in
my
time
i
remember
i
used
to
be
called
the
psammead
of
the
desert
i
was
always
having
compliments
paid
me
i
can
t
think
can
you
give
wishes
then
asked
jane
who
had
now
come
in
too
oh
dear
me
no
said
the
phoenix
contemptuously
at
least
but
i
hear
footsteps
approaching
i
hasten
to
conceal
and
it
did
i
think
i
said
that
this
day
was
saturday
it
was
also
cook
s
birthday
and
mother
had
allowed
her
and
eliza
to
go
to
the
crystal
palace
with
a
party
of
friends
so
jane
and
anthea
of
course
had
to
help
to
make
beds
and
to
wash
up
the
breakfast
cups
and
little
things
like
that
robert
and
cyril
intended
to
spend
the
morning
in
conversation
with
the
phoenix
but
the
bird
had
its
own
ideas
about
this
i
must
have
an
hour
or
two
s
quiet
it
said
i
really
must
my
nerves
will
give
way
unless
i
can
get
a
little
rest
you
must
remember
it
s
two
thousand
years
since
i
had
any
conversation
i
m
out
of
practice
and
i
must
take
care
of
myself
i
ve
often
been
told
that
mine
is
a
valuable
so
it
nestled
down
inside
an
old
hatbox
of
father
s
which
had
been
brought
down
from
the
some
days
before
when
a
helmet
was
suddenly
needed
for
a
game
of
tournaments
with
its
golden
head
under
its
golden
wing
and
went
to
sleep
so
then
robert
and
cyril
moved
the
table
back
and
were
going
to
sit
on
the
carpet
and
wish
themselves
somewhere
else
but
before
they
could
decide
on
the
place
cyril
said
i
don
t
know
perhaps
it
s
rather
sneakish
to
begin
without
the
they
ll
be
all
the
morning
said
robert
impatiently
and
then
a
thing
inside
him
which
tiresome
books
sometimes
call
the
inward
monitor
said
why
don
t
you
help
them
then
cyril
s
inward
monitor
happened
to
say
the
same
thing
at
the
same
moment
so
the
boys
went
and
helped
to
wash
up
the
and
to
dust
the
robert
was
so
interested
that
he
proposed
to
clean
the
front
doorsteps
a
thing
he
had
never
been
allowed
to
do
nor
was
he
allowed
to
do
it
on
this
occasion
one
reason
was
that
it
had
already
been
done
by
cook
when
all
the
housework
was
finished
the
girls
dressed
the
happy
wriggling
baby
in
his
blue
highwayman
coat
and
hat
and
kept
him
amused
while
mother
changed
her
dress
and
got
ready
to
take
him
over
to
granny
s
mother
always
went
to
granny
s
every
saturday
and
generally
some
of
the
children
went
with
her
but
today
they
were
to
keep
house
and
their
hearts
were
full
of
joyous
and
delightful
feelings
every
time
they
remembered
that
the
house
they
would
have
to
keep
had
a
phoenix
in
it
and
a
wishing
carpet
you
can
always
keep
the
lamb
good
and
happy
for
quite
a
long
time
if
you
play
the
noah
s
ark
game
with
him
it
is
quite
simple
he
just
sits
on
your
lap
and
tells
you
what
animal
he
is
and
then
you
say
the
little
poetry
piece
about
whatever
animal
he
chooses
to
be
of
course
some
of
the
animals
like
the
zebra
and
the
tiger
haven
t
got
any
poetry
because
they
are
so
difficult
to
rhyme
to
the
lamb
knows
quite
well
which
are
the
poetry
animals
i
m
a
baby
bear
said
the
lamb
snugging
down
and
anthea
began
i
love
my
little
baby
bear
i
love
his
nose
and
toes
and
hair
i
like
to
hold
him
in
my
arm
and
keep
him
very
safe
and
and
when
she
said
very
of
course
there
was
a
real
bear
s
hug
then
came
the
eel
and
the
lamb
was
tickled
till
he
wriggled
exactly
like
a
real
one
i
love
my
little
baby
eel
he
is
so
squidglety
to
feel
he
ll
be
an
eel
when
he
is
big
but
now
he
s
just
a
tiny
snig
perhaps
you
didn
t
know
that
a
snig
was
a
baby
eel
it
is
though
and
the
lamb
knew
it
hedgehog
he
said
and
anthea
went
on
my
baby
hedgehog
how
i
like
ye
though
your
back
s
so
your
front
is
very
soft
i
ve
found
so
i
must
love
you
front
ways
round
and
then
she
loved
him
front
ways
round
while
he
squealed
with
pleasure
it
is
a
very
baby
game
and
of
course
the
rhymes
are
only
meant
for
very
very
small
people
not
for
people
who
are
old
enough
to
read
books
so
i
won
t
tell
you
any
more
of
them
by
the
time
the
lamb
had
been
a
baby
lion
and
a
baby
weazel
and
a
baby
rabbit
and
a
baby
rat
mother
was
ready
and
she
and
the
lamb
having
been
kissed
by
everybody
and
hugged
as
thoroughly
as
it
is
possible
to
be
when
you
re
dressed
for
were
seen
to
the
tram
by
the
boys
when
the
boys
came
back
every
one
looked
at
every
one
else
and
said
now
they
locked
the
front
door
and
they
locked
the
back
door
and
they
fastened
all
the
windows
they
moved
the
table
and
chairs
off
the
carpet
and
anthea
swept
it
we
must
show
it
a
little
attention
she
said
kindly
we
ll
give
it
next
time
carpets
like
then
every
one
put
on
its
things
because
as
cyril
said
they
didn
t
know
where
they
might
be
going
and
it
makes
people
stare
if
you
go
out
of
doors
in
november
in
pinafores
and
without
hats
then
robert
gently
awoke
the
phoenix
who
yawned
and
stretched
itself
and
allowed
robert
to
lift
it
on
to
the
middle
of
the
carpet
where
it
instantly
went
to
sleep
again
with
its
crested
head
tucked
under
its
golden
wing
as
before
then
every
one
sat
down
on
the
carpet
where
shall
we
go
was
of
course
the
question
and
it
was
warmly
discussed
anthea
wanted
to
go
to
japan
robert
and
cyril
voted
for
america
and
jane
wished
to
go
to
the
seaside
because
there
are
donkeys
there
said
she
not
in
november
silly
said
cyril
and
the
discussion
got
warmer
and
warmer
and
still
nothing
was
settled
i
vote
we
let
the
phoenix
decide
said
robert
at
last
so
they
stroked
it
till
it
woke
we
want
to
go
somewhere
abroad
they
said
and
we
can
t
make
up
our
minds
let
the
carpet
make
up
its
mind
if
it
has
one
said
the
phoenix
just
say
you
wish
to
go
so
they
did
and
the
next
moment
the
world
seemed
to
spin
upside
down
and
when
it
was
right
way
up
again
and
they
were
ungiddy
enough
to
look
about
them
they
were
out
of
doors
out
of
doors
this
is
a
feeble
way
to
express
where
they
were
they
were
out
of
out
of
the
earth
or
off
it
in
fact
they
were
floating
steadily
safely
splendidly
in
the
crisp
clear
air
with
the
pale
bright
blue
of
the
sky
above
them
and
far
down
below
the
pale
bright
waves
of
the
sea
the
carpet
had
stiffened
itself
somehow
so
that
it
was
square
and
firm
like
a
raft
and
it
steered
itself
so
beautifully
and
kept
on
its
way
so
flat
and
fearless
that
no
one
was
at
all
afraid
of
tumbling
off
in
front
of
them
lay
land
the
coast
of
france
said
the
phoenix
waking
up
and
pointing
with
its
wing
where
do
you
wish
to
go
i
should
always
keep
one
wish
of
course
for
emergencies
otherwise
you
may
get
into
an
emergency
from
which
you
can
t
emerge
at
but
the
children
were
far
too
deeply
interested
to
listen
i
tell
you
what
said
cyril
let
s
let
the
thing
go
on
and
on
and
when
we
see
a
place
we
really
want
to
stop
at
why
we
ll
just
stop
isn
t
this
ripping
it
s
like
trains
said
anthea
as
they
swept
over
the
and
held
a
steady
course
above
orderly
fields
and
straight
roads
bordered
with
poplar
trees
like
express
trains
only
in
trains
you
never
can
see
anything
because
of
wanting
the
windows
shut
and
then
they
breathe
on
them
and
it
s
like
ground
glass
and
nobody
can
see
anything
and
then
they
go
to
it
s
like
tobogganing
said
robert
so
fast
and
smooth
only
there
s
no
to
stop
short
on
it
goes
on
and
you
darling
phoenix
said
jane
it
s
all
your
doing
oh
look
at
that
ducky
little
church
and
the
women
with
flappy
cappy
things
on
their
don
t
mention
it
said
the
phoenix
with
sleepy
politeness
oh
said
cyril
summing
up
all
the
rapture
that
was
in
every
heart
look
at
it
all
look
at
it
and
think
of
the
kentish
town
road
every
one
looked
and
every
one
thought
and
the
glorious
gliding
smooth
steady
rush
went
on
and
they
looked
down
on
strange
and
beautiful
things
and
held
their
breath
and
let
it
go
in
deep
sighs
and
said
oh
and
ah
till
it
was
long
past
it
was
jane
who
suddenly
said
i
wish
we
d
brought
that
jam
tart
and
cold
mutton
with
us
it
would
have
been
jolly
to
have
a
picnic
in
the
the
jam
tart
and
cold
mutton
were
however
far
away
sitting
quietly
in
the
larder
of
the
house
in
camden
town
which
the
children
were
supposed
to
be
keeping
a
mouse
was
at
that
moment
tasting
the
outside
of
the
raspberry
jam
part
of
the
tart
she
had
nibbled
a
sort
of
gulf
or
bay
through
the
pastry
edge
to
see
whether
it
was
the
sort
of
dinner
she
could
ask
her
little
to
sit
down
to
she
had
had
a
very
good
dinner
herself
it
is
an
ill
wind
that
blows
nobody
any
good
we
ll
stop
as
soon
as
we
see
a
nice
place
said
anthea
i
ve
got
threepence
and
you
boys
have
the
fourpence
each
that
your
trams
didn
t
cost
the
other
day
so
we
can
buy
things
to
eat
i
expect
the
phoenix
can
speak
the
carpet
was
sailing
along
over
rocks
and
rivers
and
trees
and
towns
and
farms
and
fields
it
reminded
everybody
of
a
certain
time
when
all
of
them
had
had
wings
and
had
flown
up
to
the
top
of
a
church
tower
and
had
had
a
feast
there
of
chicken
and
tongue
and
new
bread
and
and
this
again
reminded
them
how
hungry
they
were
and
just
as
they
were
all
being
reminded
of
this
very
strongly
indeed
they
saw
ahead
of
them
some
ruined
walls
on
a
hill
and
strong
and
upright
and
really
to
look
at
as
good
as
new
a
great
square
tower
the
top
of
that
s
just
the
exactly
same
size
as
the
carpet
said
jane
think
it
would
be
good
to
go
to
the
top
of
that
because
then
none
of
the
i
mean
natives
would
be
able
to
take
the
carpet
away
even
if
they
wanted
to
and
some
of
us
could
go
out
and
get
things
to
eat
buy
them
honestly
i
mean
not
take
them
out
of
larder
i
think
it
would
be
better
if
we
went
anthea
was
beginning
but
jane
suddenly
clenched
her
hands
i
don
t
see
why
i
should
never
do
anything
i
want
just
because
i
m
the
youngest
i
wish
the
carpet
would
fit
itself
in
at
the
top
of
that
tower
so
there
the
carpet
made
a
disconcerting
bound
and
next
moment
it
was
hovering
above
the
square
top
of
the
tower
then
slowly
and
carefully
it
began
to
sink
under
them
it
was
like
a
lift
going
down
with
you
at
the
army
and
navy
stores
i
don
t
think
we
ought
to
wish
things
without
all
agreeing
to
them
first
said
robert
huffishly
hullo
what
on
earth
for
unexpectedly
and
greyly
something
was
coming
up
all
round
the
four
sides
of
the
carpet
it
was
as
if
a
wall
were
being
built
by
magic
quickness
it
was
a
foot
high
it
was
two
feet
high
three
four
five
it
was
shutting
out
the
light
more
and
more
anthea
looked
up
at
the
sky
and
the
walls
that
now
rose
six
feet
above
them
we
re
dropping
into
the
tower
she
screamed
there
wasn
t
any
top
to
it
so
the
carpet
s
going
to
fit
itself
in
at
the
robert
sprang
to
his
feet
we
ought
to
have
hullo
an
owl
s
he
put
his
knee
on
a
jutting
smooth
piece
of
grey
stone
and
reached
his
hand
into
a
deep
window
slit
broad
to
the
inside
of
the
tower
and
narrowing
like
a
funnel
to
the
outside
look
sharp
cried
every
one
but
robert
did
not
look
sharp
enough
by
the
time
he
had
drawn
his
hand
out
of
the
owl
s
nest
there
were
no
eggs
there
the
carpet
had
sunk
eight
feet
below
him
jump
you
silly
cuckoo
cried
cyril
with
brotherly
anxiety
but
robert
couldn
t
turn
round
all
in
a
minute
into
a
jumping
position
he
wriggled
and
twisted
and
got
on
to
the
broad
ledge
and
by
the
time
he
was
ready
to
jump
the
walls
of
the
tower
had
risen
up
thirty
feet
above
the
others
who
were
still
sinking
with
the
carpet
and
robert
found
himself
in
the
embrasure
of
a
window
alone
for
even
the
owls
were
not
at
home
that
day
the
wall
was
smoothish
there
was
no
climbing
up
and
as
for
climbing
down
robert
hid
his
face
in
his
hands
and
squirmed
back
and
back
from
the
giddy
verge
until
the
back
part
of
him
was
wedged
quite
tight
in
the
narrowest
part
of
the
window
slit
he
was
safe
now
of
course
but
the
outside
part
of
his
window
was
like
a
frame
to
a
picture
of
part
of
the
other
side
of
the
tower
it
was
very
pretty
with
moss
growing
between
the
stones
and
little
shiny
gems
but
between
him
and
it
there
was
the
width
of
the
tower
and
nothing
in
it
but
empty
air
the
situation
was
terrible
robert
saw
in
a
flash
that
the
carpet
was
likely
to
bring
them
into
just
the
same
sort
of
tight
places
that
they
used
to
get
into
with
the
wishes
the
psammead
granted
them
and
the
others
imagine
their
feelings
as
the
carpet
sank
slowly
and
steadily
to
the
very
bottom
of
the
tower
leaving
robert
clinging
to
the
wall
robert
did
not
even
try
to
imagine
their
feelings
he
had
quite
enough
to
do
with
his
own
but
you
can
as
soon
as
the
carpet
came
to
a
stop
on
the
ground
at
the
bottom
of
the
inside
of
the
tower
it
suddenly
lost
that
stiffness
which
had
been
such
a
comfort
during
the
journey
from
camden
town
to
the
topless
tower
and
spread
itself
limply
over
the
loose
stones
and
little
earthy
mounds
at
the
bottom
of
the
tower
just
exactly
like
any
ordinary
carpet
also
it
shrank
suddenly
so
that
it
seemed
to
draw
away
from
under
their
feet
and
they
stepped
quickly
off
the
edges
and
stood
on
the
firm
ground
while
the
carpet
drew
itself
in
till
it
was
its
proper
size
and
no
longer
fitted
exactly
into
the
inside
of
the
tower
but
left
quite
a
big
space
all
round
it
then
across
the
carpet
they
looked
at
each
other
and
then
every
chin
was
tilted
up
and
every
eye
sought
vainly
to
see
where
poor
robert
had
got
to
of
course
they
couldn
t
see
him
i
wish
we
hadn
t
come
said
jane
you
always
do
said
cyril
briefly
look
here
we
can
t
leave
robert
up
there
i
wish
the
carpet
would
fetch
him
the
carpet
seemed
to
awake
from
a
dream
and
pull
itself
together
it
stiffened
itself
briskly
and
floated
up
between
the
four
walls
of
the
tower
the
children
below
craned
their
heads
back
and
nearly
broke
their
necks
in
doing
it
the
carpet
rose
and
rose
it
hung
poised
darkly
above
them
for
an
anxious
moment
or
two
then
it
dropped
down
again
threw
itself
on
the
uneven
floor
of
the
tower
and
as
it
did
so
it
tumbled
robert
out
on
the
uneven
floor
of
the
tower
oh
glory
said
robert
that
was
a
squeak
you
don
t
know
how
i
felt
i
say
i
ve
had
about
enough
for
a
bit
let
s
wish
ourselves
at
home
again
and
have
a
go
at
that
jam
tart
and
mutton
we
can
go
out
again
righto
said
every
one
for
the
adventure
had
shaken
the
nerves
of
all
so
they
all
got
on
to
the
carpet
again
and
said
i
wish
we
were
at
and
lo
and
behold
they
were
no
more
at
home
than
before
the
carpet
never
moved
the
phoenix
had
taken
the
opportunity
to
go
to
sleep
anthea
woke
it
up
gently
look
here
she
said
i
m
looking
said
the
phoenix
we
wished
to
be
at
home
and
we
re
still
here
complained
jane
no
said
the
phoenix
looking
about
it
at
the
high
dark
walls
of
the
tower
no
i
quite
see
but
we
wished
to
be
at
home
said
cyril
no
doubt
said
the
bird
politely
and
the
carpet
hasn
t
moved
an
inch
said
robert
no
said
the
phoenix
i
see
it
hasn
but
i
thought
it
was
a
wishing
carpet
so
it
is
said
the
phoenix
then
why
asked
the
children
altogether
i
did
tell
you
you
know
said
the
phoenix
only
you
are
so
fond
of
listening
to
the
music
of
your
own
voices
it
is
indeed
the
most
lovely
music
to
each
of
us
and
therefore
you
did
tell
us
what
interrupted
an
exasperated
why
that
the
carpet
only
gives
you
three
wishes
a
day
and
you
ve
had
there
was
a
heartfelt
silence
then
how
are
we
going
to
get
home
said
cyril
at
last
i
haven
t
any
idea
replied
the
phoenix
kindly
can
i
fly
out
and
get
you
any
little
thing
how
could
you
carry
the
money
to
pay
for
it
it
isn
t
necessary
birds
always
take
what
they
want
it
is
not
regarded
as
stealing
except
in
the
case
of
the
children
were
glad
to
find
they
had
been
right
in
supposing
this
to
be
the
case
on
the
day
when
they
had
wings
and
had
enjoyed
somebody
else
s
ripe
plums
yes
let
the
phoenix
get
us
something
to
eat
anyway
robert
urged
if
it
will
be
so
kind
you
mean
corrected
anthea
in
a
whisper
if
it
will
be
so
kind
and
we
can
be
thinking
while
it
s
so
the
phoenix
fluttered
up
through
the
grey
space
of
the
tower
and
vanished
at
the
top
and
it
was
not
till
it
had
quite
gone
that
jane
said
suppose
it
never
comes
it
was
not
a
pleasant
thought
and
though
anthea
at
once
said
of
course
it
will
come
back
i
m
certain
it
s
a
bird
of
its
word
a
further
gloom
was
cast
by
the
idea
for
curiously
enough
there
was
no
door
to
the
tower
and
all
the
windows
were
far
far
too
high
to
be
reached
by
the
most
adventurous
climber
it
was
cold
too
and
anthea
shivered
yes
said
cyril
it
s
like
being
at
the
bottom
of
a
the
children
waited
in
a
sad
and
hungry
silence
and
got
little
stiff
necks
with
holding
their
little
heads
back
to
look
up
the
inside
of
the
tall
grey
tower
to
see
if
the
phoenix
were
coming
at
last
it
came
it
looked
very
big
as
it
fluttered
down
between
the
walls
and
as
it
neared
them
the
children
saw
that
its
bigness
was
caused
by
a
basket
of
boiled
chestnuts
which
it
carried
in
one
claw
in
the
other
it
held
a
piece
of
bread
and
in
its
beak
was
a
very
large
pear
the
pear
was
juicy
and
as
good
as
a
very
small
drink
when
the
meal
was
over
every
one
felt
better
and
the
question
of
how
to
get
home
was
discussed
without
any
disagreeableness
but
no
one
could
think
of
any
way
out
of
the
difficulty
or
even
out
of
the
tower
for
the
phoenix
though
its
beak
and
claws
had
fortunately
been
strong
enough
to
carry
food
for
them
was
plainly
not
equal
to
flying
through
the
air
with
four
children
we
must
stay
here
i
suppose
said
robert
at
last
and
shout
out
every
now
and
then
and
some
one
will
hear
us
and
bring
ropes
and
ladders
and
rescue
us
like
out
of
mines
and
they
ll
get
up
a
subscription
to
send
us
home
like
yes
but
we
shan
t
be
home
before
mother
is
and
then
father
ll
take
away
the
carpet
and
say
it
s
dangerous
or
something
said
cyril
i
do
wish
we
hadn
t
come
said
jane
and
every
one
else
said
shut
up
except
anthea
who
suddenly
awoke
the
phoenix
and
said
look
here
i
believe
you
can
help
us
oh
i
do
wish
you
would
i
will
help
you
as
far
as
lies
in
my
power
said
the
phoenix
at
once
what
is
it
you
want
now
why
we
want
to
get
home
said
every
one
oh
said
the
phoenix
ah
hum
yes
home
you
said
meaning
where
we
live
where
we
slept
last
night
where
the
altar
is
that
your
egg
was
hatched
oh
there
said
the
phoenix
well
i
ll
do
my
it
fluttered
on
to
the
carpet
and
walked
up
and
down
for
a
few
minutes
in
deep
thought
then
it
drew
itself
up
proudly
i
can
help
you
it
said
i
am
almost
sure
i
can
help
you
unless
i
am
grossly
deceived
i
can
help
you
you
won
t
mind
my
leaving
you
for
an
hour
or
two
and
without
waiting
for
a
reply
it
soared
up
through
the
dimness
of
the
tower
into
the
brightness
above
now
said
cyril
firmly
it
said
an
hour
or
two
but
i
ve
read
about
captives
and
people
shut
up
in
dungeons
and
catacombs
and
things
awaiting
release
and
i
know
each
moment
is
an
eternity
those
people
always
do
something
to
pass
the
desperate
moments
it
s
no
use
our
trying
to
tame
spiders
because
we
shan
t
have
i
hope
not
said
jane
doubtfully
but
we
ought
to
scratch
our
names
on
the
stones
or
i
say
talking
of
stones
said
robert
you
see
that
heap
of
stones
against
the
wall
over
in
that
corner
well
i
m
certain
there
s
a
hole
in
the
wall
there
and
i
believe
it
s
a
door
yes
look
here
the
stones
are
round
like
an
arch
in
the
wall
and
here
s
the
hole
it
s
all
black
he
had
walked
over
to
the
heap
as
he
spoke
and
climbed
up
to
it
dislodged
the
top
stone
of
the
heap
and
uncovered
a
little
dark
space
next
moment
every
one
was
helping
to
pull
down
the
heap
of
stones
and
very
soon
every
one
threw
off
its
jacket
for
it
was
warm
work
it
is
a
door
said
cyril
wiping
his
face
and
not
a
bad
thing
either
if
he
was
going
to
add
if
anything
happens
to
the
phoenix
but
he
didn
t
for
fear
of
frightening
jane
he
was
not
an
unkind
boy
when
he
had
leisure
to
think
of
such
things
the
arched
hole
in
the
wall
grew
larger
and
larger
it
was
very
very
black
even
compared
with
the
sort
of
twilight
at
the
bottom
of
the
tower
it
grew
larger
because
the
children
kept
pulling
off
the
stones
and
throwing
them
down
into
another
heap
the
stones
must
have
been
there
a
very
long
time
for
they
were
covered
with
moss
and
some
of
them
were
stuck
together
by
it
so
it
was
fairly
hard
work
as
robert
pointed
out
when
the
hole
reached
to
about
halfway
between
the
top
of
the
arch
and
the
tower
robert
and
cyril
let
themselves
down
cautiously
on
the
inside
and
lit
matches
how
thankful
they
felt
then
that
they
had
a
sensible
father
who
did
not
forbid
them
to
carry
matches
as
some
boys
fathers
do
the
father
of
robert
and
cyril
only
insisted
on
the
matches
being
of
the
kind
that
strike
only
on
the
box
it
s
not
a
door
it
s
a
sort
of
tunnel
robert
cried
to
the
girls
after
the
first
match
had
flared
up
flickered
and
gone
out
stand
off
we
ll
push
some
more
stones
down
they
did
amid
deep
excitement
and
now
the
stone
heap
was
almost
gone
and
before
them
the
girls
saw
the
dark
archway
leading
to
unknown
things
all
doubts
and
fears
as
to
getting
home
were
forgotten
in
this
thrilling
moment
it
was
like
monte
cristo
it
was
like
i
say
cried
anthea
suddenly
come
out
there
s
always
bad
air
in
places
that
have
been
shut
up
it
makes
your
torches
go
out
and
then
you
die
it
s
called
i
believe
come
out
i
tell
the
urgency
of
her
tone
actually
brought
the
boys
out
and
then
every
one
took
up
its
jacket
and
fanned
the
dark
arch
with
it
so
as
to
make
the
air
fresh
inside
when
anthea
thought
the
air
inside
must
be
freshened
by
now
cyril
led
the
way
into
the
arch
the
girls
followed
and
robert
came
last
because
jane
refused
to
tail
the
procession
lest
something
should
come
in
after
her
and
catch
at
her
from
behind
cyril
advanced
cautiously
lighting
match
after
match
and
peering
before
him
it
s
a
vaulting
roof
he
said
and
it
s
all
stone
all
right
panther
don
t
keep
pulling
at
my
jacket
the
air
must
be
all
right
because
of
the
matches
silly
and
there
are
look
out
there
are
steps
oh
don
t
let
s
go
any
farther
said
jane
in
an
agony
of
reluctance
a
very
painful
thing
by
the
way
to
be
in
i
m
sure
there
are
snakes
or
dens
of
lions
or
something
do
let
s
go
back
and
come
some
other
time
with
candles
and
bellows
for
the
let
me
get
in
front
of
you
then
said
the
stern
voice
of
robert
from
behind
this
is
exactly
the
place
for
buried
treasure
and
i
m
going
on
anyway
you
can
stay
behind
if
you
and
then
of
course
jane
consented
to
go
on
so
very
slowly
and
carefully
the
children
went
down
the
steps
there
were
seventeen
of
them
and
at
the
bottom
of
the
steps
were
more
passages
branching
four
ways
and
a
sort
of
low
arch
on
the
side
made
cyril
wonder
what
it
could
be
for
it
was
too
low
to
be
the
beginning
of
another
passage
so
he
knelt
down
and
lit
a
match
and
stooping
very
low
he
peeped
in
there
s
something
he
said
and
reached
out
his
hand
it
touched
something
that
felt
more
like
a
damp
bag
of
marbles
than
anything
else
that
cyril
had
ever
touched
i
believe
it
is
a
buried
treasure
he
cried
and
it
was
for
even
as
anthea
cried
oh
hurry
up
squirrel
fetch
it
out
cyril
pulled
out
a
rotting
canvas
bag
about
as
big
as
the
paper
ones
the
greengrocer
gives
you
with
barcelona
nuts
in
for
sixpence
there
s
more
of
it
a
lot
more
he
said
as
he
pulled
the
rotten
bag
gave
way
and
the
gold
coins
ran
and
span
and
jumped
and
bumped
and
chinked
and
clinked
on
the
floor
of
the
dark
passage
i
wonder
what
you
would
say
if
you
suddenly
came
upon
a
buried
treasure
what
cyril
said
was
oh
bother
i
ve
burnt
my
fingers
and
as
he
spoke
he
dropped
the
match
and
it
was
the
last
he
added
there
was
a
moment
of
desperate
silence
then
jane
began
to
cry
don
t
said
anthea
don
t
pussy
you
ll
exhaust
the
air
if
you
cry
we
can
get
out
all
yes
said
jane
through
her
sobs
and
find
the
phoenix
has
come
back
and
gone
away
again
because
it
thought
we
d
gone
home
some
other
way
and
oh
i
wish
we
hadn
t
every
one
stood
quite
still
only
anthea
cuddled
jane
up
to
her
and
tried
to
wipe
her
eyes
in
the
dark
t
said
jane
that
s
my
ear
i
m
not
crying
with
my
come
let
s
get
on
out
said
robert
but
that
was
not
so
easy
for
no
one
could
remember
exactly
which
way
they
had
come
it
is
very
difficult
to
remember
things
in
the
dark
unless
you
have
matches
with
you
and
then
of
course
it
is
quite
different
even
if
you
don
t
strike
one
every
one
had
come
to
agree
with
jane
s
constant
wish
and
despair
was
making
the
darkness
blacker
than
ever
when
quite
suddenly
the
floor
seemed
to
tip
up
and
a
strong
sensation
of
being
in
a
whirling
lift
came
upon
every
one
all
eyes
were
closed
one
s
eyes
always
are
in
the
dark
don
t
you
think
when
the
whirling
feeling
stopped
cyril
said
earthquakes
and
they
all
opened
their
eyes
they
were
in
their
own
dingy
at
home
and
oh
how
light
and
bright
and
safe
and
pleasant
and
altogether
delightful
it
seemed
after
that
dark
underground
tunnel
the
carpet
lay
on
the
floor
looking
as
calm
as
though
it
had
never
been
for
an
excursion
in
its
life
on
the
mantelpiece
stood
the
phoenix
waiting
with
an
air
of
modest
yet
sterling
worth
for
the
thanks
of
the
children
but
how
did
you
do
it
they
asked
when
every
one
had
thanked
the
phoenix
again
and
again
oh
i
just
went
and
got
a
wish
from
your
friend
the
but
how
did
you
know
where
to
find
it
i
found
that
out
from
the
carpet
these
wishing
creatures
always
know
all
about
each
other
they
re
so
clannish
like
the
scots
you
know
all
but
the
carpet
can
t
talk
can
it
then
how
how
did
i
get
the
psammead
s
address
i
tell
you
i
got
it
from
the
did
it
speak
then
no
said
the
phoenix
thoughtfully
it
didn
t
speak
but
i
gathered
my
information
from
something
in
its
manner
i
was
always
a
singularly
observant
it
was
not
till
after
the
cold
mutton
and
the
jam
tart
as
well
as
the
tea
and
that
any
one
found
time
to
regret
the
golden
treasure
which
had
been
left
scattered
on
the
floor
of
the
underground
passage
and
which
indeed
no
one
had
thought
of
till
now
since
the
moment
when
cyril
burnt
his
fingers
at
the
flame
of
the
last
match
what
owls
and
goats
we
were
said
robert
look
how
we
ve
always
wanted
treasure
and
now
never
mind
said
anthea
trying
as
usual
to
make
the
best
of
it
we
ll
go
back
again
and
get
it
all
and
then
we
ll
give
everybody
more
than
a
quarter
of
an
hour
passed
most
agreeably
in
arranging
what
presents
should
be
given
to
whom
and
when
the
claims
of
generosity
had
been
satisfied
the
talk
ran
for
fifty
minutes
on
what
they
would
buy
for
themselves
it
was
cyril
who
broke
in
on
robert
s
almost
too
technical
account
of
the
on
which
he
meant
to
go
to
and
from
school
there
he
said
dry
up
it
s
no
good
we
can
t
ever
go
back
we
don
t
know
where
it
don
t
you
know
jane
asked
the
phoenix
wistfully
not
in
the
least
the
phoenix
replied
in
a
tone
of
amiable
regret
then
we
ve
lost
the
treasure
said
cyril
and
they
had
but
we
ve
got
the
carpet
and
the
phoenix
said
anthea
excuse
me
said
the
bird
with
an
air
of
wounded
dignity
i
do
so
hate
to
seem
to
interfere
but
surely
you
must
mean
the
phoenix
and
the
carpet
chapter
the
queen
cook
it
was
on
a
saturday
that
the
children
made
their
first
glorious
journey
on
the
wishing
carpet
unless
you
are
too
young
to
read
at
all
you
will
know
that
the
next
day
must
have
been
sunday
sunday
at
camden
terrace
camden
town
was
always
a
very
pretty
day
father
always
brought
home
flowers
on
saturday
so
that
the
was
extra
beautiful
in
november
of
course
the
flowers
were
chrysanthemums
yellow
and
coppery
coloured
then
there
were
always
sausages
on
toast
for
breakfast
and
these
are
rapture
after
six
days
of
kentish
town
road
eggs
at
fourteen
a
shilling
on
this
particular
sunday
there
were
fowls
for
dinner
a
kind
of
food
that
is
generally
kept
for
birthdays
and
grand
occasions
and
there
was
an
angel
pudding
when
rice
and
milk
and
oranges
and
white
icing
do
their
best
to
make
you
happy
after
dinner
father
was
very
sleepy
indeed
because
he
had
been
working
hard
all
the
week
but
he
did
not
yield
to
the
voice
that
said
go
and
have
an
hour
s
he
nursed
the
lamb
who
had
a
horrid
cough
that
cook
said
was
as
sure
as
eggs
and
he
said
come
along
kiddies
i
ve
got
a
ripping
book
from
the
library
called
the
golden
age
and
i
ll
read
it
to
mother
settled
herself
on
the
sofa
and
said
she
could
listen
quite
nicely
with
her
eyes
shut
the
lamb
snugged
into
the
armchair
corner
of
daddy
s
arm
and
the
others
got
into
a
happy
heap
on
the
at
first
of
course
there
were
too
many
feet
and
knees
and
shoulders
and
elbows
but
real
comfort
was
actually
settling
down
on
them
and
the
phoenix
and
the
carpet
were
put
away
on
the
back
top
shelf
of
their
minds
beautiful
things
that
could
be
taken
out
and
played
with
later
when
a
surly
solid
knock
came
at
the
door
it
opened
an
angry
inch
and
the
cook
s
voice
said
please
m
may
i
speak
to
you
a
moment
mother
looked
at
father
with
a
desperate
expression
then
she
put
her
pretty
sparkly
sunday
shoes
down
from
the
sofa
and
stood
up
in
them
and
sighed
as
good
fish
in
the
sea
said
father
cheerfully
and
it
was
not
till
much
later
that
the
children
understood
what
he
meant
mother
went
out
into
the
passage
which
is
called
the
hall
where
the
is
and
the
picture
of
the
monarch
of
the
glen
in
a
yellow
shining
frame
with
brown
spots
on
the
monarch
from
the
damp
in
the
house
before
last
and
there
was
cook
very
red
and
damp
in
the
face
and
with
a
clean
apron
tied
on
all
crooked
over
the
dirty
one
that
she
had
dished
up
those
dear
delightful
chickens
in
she
stood
there
and
she
seemed
to
get
redder
and
damper
and
she
twisted
the
corner
of
her
apron
round
her
fingers
and
she
said
very
shortly
and
fiercely
if
you
please
ma
am
i
should
wish
to
leave
at
my
day
mother
leaned
against
the
hatstand
the
children
could
see
her
looking
pale
through
the
crack
of
the
door
because
she
had
been
very
kind
to
the
cook
and
had
given
her
a
holiday
only
the
day
before
and
it
seemed
so
very
unkind
of
the
cook
to
want
to
go
like
this
and
on
a
sunday
too
why
what
s
the
matter
mother
said
it
s
them
children
the
cook
replied
and
somehow
the
children
all
felt
that
they
had
known
it
from
the
first
they
did
not
remember
having
done
anything
extra
wrong
but
it
is
so
frightfully
easy
to
displease
a
cook
it
s
them
children
there
s
that
there
new
carpet
in
their
room
covered
thick
with
mud
both
sides
beastly
yellow
mud
and
sakes
alive
knows
where
they
got
it
and
all
that
muck
to
clean
up
on
a
sunday
it
s
not
my
place
and
it
s
not
my
intentions
so
i
don
t
deceive
you
ma
am
and
but
for
them
limbs
which
they
is
if
ever
there
was
it
s
not
a
bad
place
though
i
says
it
and
i
wouldn
t
wish
to
leave
but
i
m
very
sorry
said
mother
gently
i
will
speak
to
the
children
and
you
had
better
think
it
over
and
if
you
really
wish
to
go
tell
me
next
day
mother
had
a
quiet
talk
with
cook
and
cook
said
she
didn
t
mind
if
she
stayed
on
a
bit
just
to
see
but
meantime
the
question
of
the
muddy
carpet
had
been
gone
into
thoroughly
by
father
and
mother
jane
s
candid
explanation
that
the
mud
had
come
from
the
bottom
of
a
foreign
tower
where
there
was
buried
treasure
was
received
with
such
chilling
disbelief
that
the
others
limited
their
defence
to
an
expression
of
sorrow
and
of
a
determination
not
to
do
it
again
but
father
said
and
mother
agreed
with
him
because
mothers
have
to
agree
with
fathers
and
not
because
it
was
her
own
idea
that
children
who
coated
a
carpet
on
both
sides
with
thick
mud
and
when
they
were
asked
for
an
explanation
could
only
talk
silly
nonsense
that
meant
jane
s
truthful
statement
were
not
fit
to
have
a
carpet
at
all
and
indeed
shouldn
t
have
one
for
a
week
so
the
carpet
was
brushed
with
too
which
was
the
only
comfort
anthea
could
think
of
and
folded
up
and
put
away
in
the
cupboard
at
the
top
of
the
stairs
and
daddy
put
the
key
in
his
trousers
pocket
till
saturday
said
he
never
mind
said
anthea
we
ve
got
the
but
as
it
happened
they
hadn
t
the
phoenix
was
nowhere
to
be
found
and
everything
had
suddenly
settled
down
from
the
rosy
wild
beauty
of
magic
happenings
to
the
common
damp
brownness
of
ordinary
november
life
in
camden
town
and
there
was
the
nursery
floor
all
bare
boards
in
the
middle
and
brown
oilcloth
round
the
outside
and
the
bareness
and
yellowness
of
the
middle
floor
showed
up
the
blackbeetles
with
terrible
distinctness
when
the
poor
things
came
out
in
the
evening
as
usual
to
try
to
make
friends
with
the
children
but
the
children
never
would
the
sunday
ended
in
gloom
which
even
junket
for
supper
in
the
blue
dresden
bowl
could
hardly
lighten
at
all
next
day
the
lamb
s
cough
was
worse
it
certainly
seemed
very
whoopy
and
the
doctor
came
in
his
brougham
carriage
every
one
tried
to
bear
up
under
the
weight
of
the
sorrow
which
it
was
to
know
that
the
wishing
carpet
was
locked
up
and
the
phoenix
mislaid
a
good
deal
of
time
was
spent
in
looking
for
the
phoenix
it
s
a
bird
of
its
word
said
anthea
i
m
sure
it
s
not
deserted
us
but
you
know
it
had
a
most
awfully
long
fly
from
wherever
it
was
to
near
rochester
and
back
and
i
expect
the
poor
thing
s
feeling
tired
out
and
wants
rest
i
am
sure
we
may
trust
the
others
tried
to
feel
sure
of
this
too
but
it
was
hard
no
one
could
be
expected
to
feel
very
kindly
towards
the
cook
since
it
was
entirely
through
her
making
such
a
fuss
about
a
little
foreign
mud
that
the
carpet
had
been
taken
away
she
might
have
told
us
said
jane
and
panther
and
i
would
have
cleaned
it
with
she
s
a
cantankerous
cat
said
robert
i
shan
t
say
what
i
think
about
her
said
anthea
primly
because
it
would
be
evil
speaking
lying
and
it
s
not
lying
to
say
she
s
a
disagreeable
pig
and
a
beastly
bozwoz
said
cyril
who
had
read
the
eyes
of
light
and
intended
to
talk
like
tony
as
soon
as
he
could
teach
robert
to
talk
like
paul
and
all
the
children
even
anthea
agreed
that
even
if
she
wasn
t
a
bozwoz
they
wished
cook
had
never
been
born
but
i
ask
you
to
believe
that
they
didn
t
do
all
the
things
on
purpose
which
so
annoyed
the
cook
during
the
following
week
though
i
daresay
the
things
would
not
have
happened
if
the
cook
had
been
a
favourite
this
is
a
mystery
explain
it
if
you
can
the
things
that
had
happened
were
as
follows
discovery
of
foreign
mud
on
both
sides
of
the
carpet
liquorice
put
on
to
boil
with
aniseed
balls
in
a
saucepan
anthea
did
this
because
she
thought
it
would
be
good
for
the
lamb
s
cough
the
whole
thing
forgotten
and
bottom
of
saucepan
burned
out
it
was
the
little
saucepan
lined
with
white
that
was
kept
for
the
baby
s
milk
a
dead
mouse
found
in
pantry
taken
to
dig
grave
with
by
regrettable
accident
broken
defence
the
cook
oughtn
t
to
keep
dead
mice
in
chopped
suet
left
on
kitchen
table
robert
added
chopped
soap
but
he
says
he
thought
the
suet
was
soap
too
broke
the
kitchen
window
by
falling
against
it
during
a
perfectly
fair
game
of
bandits
in
the
area
stopped
up
grating
of
kitchen
sink
with
putty
and
filled
sink
with
water
to
make
a
lake
to
sail
paper
boats
in
went
away
and
left
the
tap
running
kitchen
hearthrug
and
cook
s
shoes
ruined
on
saturday
the
carpet
was
restored
there
had
been
plenty
of
time
during
the
week
to
decide
where
it
should
be
asked
to
go
when
they
did
get
it
back
mother
had
gone
over
to
granny
s
and
had
not
taken
the
lamb
because
he
had
a
bad
cough
which
cook
repeatedly
said
was
as
sure
as
eggs
is
eggs
but
we
ll
take
him
out
a
ducky
darling
said
anthea
we
ll
take
him
somewhere
where
you
can
t
have
don
t
be
so
silly
robert
if
he
does
talk
about
it
no
one
ll
take
any
notice
he
s
always
talking
about
things
he
s
never
so
they
dressed
the
lamb
and
themselves
in
clothes
and
the
lamb
chuckled
and
coughed
and
laughed
and
coughed
again
poor
dear
and
all
the
chairs
and
tables
were
moved
off
the
carpet
by
the
boys
while
jane
nursed
the
lamb
and
anthea
rushed
through
the
house
in
one
last
wild
hunt
for
the
missing
phoenix
it
s
no
use
waiting
for
it
she
said
reappearing
breathless
in
the
but
i
know
it
hasn
t
deserted
us
it
s
a
bird
of
its
quite
so
said
the
gentle
voice
of
the
phoenix
from
beneath
the
table
every
one
fell
on
its
knees
and
looked
up
and
there
was
the
phoenix
perched
on
a
crossbar
of
wood
that
ran
across
under
the
table
and
had
once
supported
a
drawer
in
the
happy
days
before
the
drawer
had
been
used
as
a
boat
and
its
bottom
unfortunately
trodden
out
by
raggett
s
really
reliable
school
boots
on
the
feet
of
robert
i
ve
been
here
all
the
time
said
the
phoenix
yawning
politely
behind
its
claw
if
you
wanted
me
you
should
have
recited
the
ode
of
invocation
it
s
seven
thousand
lines
long
and
written
in
very
pure
and
beautiful
couldn
t
you
tell
it
us
in
english
asked
anthea
it
s
rather
long
isn
t
it
said
jane
jumping
the
lamb
on
her
knee
couldn
t
you
make
a
short
english
version
like
tate
and
brady
oh

said
robert
holding
out
his
hand
come
along
good
old
good
old
beautiful
phoenix
it
corrected
shyly
good
old
beautiful
phoenix
then
come
along
come
along
said
robert
impatiently
with
his
hand
still
held
out
the
phoenix
fluttered
at
once
on
to
his
wrist
this
amiable
youth
it
said
to
the
others
has
miraculously
been
able
to
put
the
whole
meaning
of
the
seven
thousand
lines
of
greek
invocation
into
one
english
hexameter
a
little
misplaced
some
of
the
words
but
oh
come
along
come
along
good
old
beautiful
phoenix
not
perfect
i
admit
but
not
bad
for
a
boy
of
his
well
now
then
said
robert
stepping
back
on
to
the
carpet
with
the
golden
phoenix
on
his
wrist
you
look
like
the
king
s
falconer
said
jane
sitting
down
on
the
carpet
with
the
baby
on
her
lap
robert
tried
to
go
on
looking
like
it
cyril
and
anthea
stood
on
the
carpet
we
shall
have
to
get
back
before
dinner
said
cyril
or
cook
will
blow
the
she
hasn
t
sneaked
since
sunday
said
anthea
she
robert
was
beginning
when
the
door
burst
open
and
the
cook
fierce
and
furious
came
in
like
a
whirlwind
and
stood
on
the
corner
of
the
carpet
with
a
broken
basin
in
one
hand
and
a
threat
in
the
other
which
was
clenched
look
ere
she
cried
my
only
basin
and
what
the
powers
am
i
to
make
the
beefsteak
and
kidney
pudding
in
that
your
ma
ordered
for
your
dinners
you
don
t
deserve
no
dinners
so
yer
don
i
m
awfully
sorry
cook
said
anthea
gently
it
was
my
fault
and
i
forgot
to
tell
you
about
it
it
got
broken
when
we
were
telling
our
fortunes
with
melted
lead
you
know
and
i
meant
to
tell
meant
to
tell
me
replied
the
cook
she
was
red
with
anger
and
really
i
don
t
wonder
meant
to
tell
well
mean
to
tell
too
i
ve
held
my
tongue
this
week
through
because
the
missus
she
said
to
me
quiet
like
we
mustn
t
expect
old
heads
on
young
shoulders
but
now
i
shan
t
hold
it
no
longer
there
was
the
soap
you
put
in
our
pudding
and
me
and
eliza
never
so
much
as
breathed
it
to
your
ma
though
well
we
might
and
the
saucepan
and
the
and
my
gracious
cats
alive
what
ave
you
got
that
blessed
child
dressed
up
in
his
outdoors
for
we
aren
t
going
to
take
him
out
said
anthea
at
least
she
stopped
short
for
though
they
weren
t
going
to
take
him
out
in
the
kentish
town
road
they
certainly
intended
to
take
him
elsewhere
but
not
at
all
where
cook
meant
when
she
said
out
this
confused
the
truthful
anthea
out
said
the
cook
that
i
ll
take
care
you
don
t
and
she
snatched
the
lamb
from
the
lap
of
jane
while
anthea
and
robert
caught
her
by
the
skirts
and
apron
look
here
said
cyril
in
stern
desperation
will
you
go
away
and
make
your
pudding
in
a
or
a
or
a
can
or
something
not
me
said
the
cook
briefly
and
leave
this
precious
poppet
for
you
to
give
his
deathercold
i
warn
you
said
cyril
solemnly
beware
ere
yet
it
be
too
late
yourself
the
little
said
the
cook
with
angry
tenderness
they
shan
t
take
it
out
no
more
they
shan
t
and
where
did
you
get
that
there
yellow
fowl
she
pointed
to
the
phoenix
even
anthea
saw
that
unless
the
cook
lost
her
situation
the
loss
would
be
theirs
i
wish
she
said
suddenly
we
were
on
a
sunny
southern
shore
where
there
can
t
be
any
she
said
it
through
the
frightened
howls
of
the
lamb
and
the
sturdy
scoldings
of
the
cook
and
instantly
the
feeling
swept
over
the
whole
party
and
the
cook
sat
down
flat
on
the
carpet
holding
the
screaming
lamb
tight
to
her
stout
self
and
calling
on
st
bridget
to
help
her
she
was
an
irishwoman
the
moment
the
feeling
stopped
the
cook
opened
her
eyes
gave
one
sounding
screech
and
shut
them
again
and
anthea
took
the
opportunity
to
get
the
desperately
howling
lamb
into
her
own
arms
it
s
all
right
she
said
own
panther
s
got
you
look
at
the
trees
and
the
sand
and
the
shells
and
the
great
big
tortoises
oh
dear
how
hot
it
is
it
certainly
was
for
the
trusty
carpet
had
laid
itself
out
on
a
southern
shore
that
was
sunny
and
no
mistake
as
robert
remarked
the
greenest
of
green
slopes
led
up
to
glorious
groves
where
and
all
the
tropical
flowers
and
fruits
that
you
read
of
in
westward
ho
and
fair
play
were
growing
in
rich
profusion
between
the
green
green
slope
and
the
blue
blue
sea
lay
a
stretch
of
sand
that
looked
like
a
carpet
of
jewelled
cloth
of
gold
for
it
was
not
greyish
as
our
northern
sand
is
but
yellow
and
changing
like
sunshine
and
rainbows
and
at
the
very
moment
when
the
wild
whirling
blinding
deafening
tumbling
of
the
stopped
the
children
had
the
happiness
of
seeing
three
large
live
turtles
waddle
down
to
the
edge
of
the
sea
and
disappear
in
the
water
and
it
was
hotter
than
you
can
possibly
imagine
unless
you
think
of
ovens
on
a
every
one
without
an
instant
s
hesitation
tore
off
its
outdoor
clothes
and
anthea
took
off
the
lamb
s
highwayman
blue
coat
and
his
hat
and
then
his
jersey
and
then
the
lamb
himself
suddenly
slipped
out
of
his
little
blue
tight
breeches
and
stood
up
happy
and
hot
in
his
little
white
shirt
i
m
sure
it
s
much
warmer
than
the
seaside
in
the
summer
said
anthea
mother
always
lets
us
go
barefoot
so
the
lamb
s
shoes
and
socks
and
gaiters
came
off
and
he
stood
digging
his
happy
naked
pink
toes
into
the
golden
smooth
sand
i
m
a
little
white
said
he
a
little
white
what
swims
and
splashed
quacking
into
a
sandy
pool
let
him
said
anthea
it
can
t
hurt
him
oh
how
hot
it
is
the
cook
suddenly
opened
her
eyes
and
screamed
shut
them
screamed
again
opened
her
eyes
once
more
and
said
why
drat
my
cats
alive
what
s
all
this
it
s
a
dream
i
expect
well
it
s
the
best
i
ever
dreamed
i
ll
look
it
up
in
the
seaside
and
trees
and
a
carpet
to
sit
on
i
never
did
look
here
said
cyril
it
isn
t
a
dream
it
s
ho
yes
said
the
cook
they
always
says
that
in
it
s
real
i
tell
you
robert
said
stamping
his
foot
i
m
not
going
to
tell
you
how
it
s
done
because
that
s
our
he
winked
heavily
at
each
of
the
others
in
turn
but
you
wouldn
t
go
away
and
make
that
pudding
so
we
had
to
bring
you
and
i
hope
you
like
i
do
that
and
no
mistake
said
the
cook
unexpectedly
and
it
being
a
dream
it
don
t
matter
what
i
say
and
i
will
say
if
it
s
my
last
word
that
of
all
the
aggravating
little
varmints
calm
yourself
my
good
woman
said
the
phoenix
good
woman
indeed
said
the
cook
good
woman
yourself
then
she
saw
who
it
was
that
had
spoken
well
if
i
ever
said
she
this
is
something
like
a
dream
yellow
fowls
and
all
i
ve
heard
of
such
but
never
did
i
think
to
see
the
well
then
said
cyril
impatiently
sit
here
and
see
the
day
now
it
s
a
jolly
fine
day
here
you
others
a
council
they
walked
along
the
shore
till
they
were
out
of
earshot
of
the
cook
who
still
sat
gazing
about
her
with
a
happy
dreamy
vacant
smile
look
here
said
cyril
we
must
roll
the
carpet
up
and
hide
it
so
that
we
can
get
at
it
at
any
moment
the
lamb
can
be
getting
rid
of
his
all
the
morning
and
we
can
look
about
and
if
the
savages
on
this
island
are
cannibals
we
ll
hook
it
and
take
her
back
and
if
not
we
ll
leave
her
is
that
being
kind
to
servants
and
animals
like
the
clergyman
said
asked
jane
nor
she
isn
t
kind
retorted
cyril
well
anyway
said
anthea
the
safest
thing
is
to
leave
the
carpet
there
with
her
sitting
on
it
perhaps
it
ll
be
a
lesson
to
her
and
anyway
if
she
thinks
it
s
a
dream
it
won
t
matter
what
she
says
when
she
gets
so
the
extra
coats
and
hats
and
mufflers
were
piled
on
the
carpet
cyril
shouldered
the
well
and
happy
lamb
the
phoenix
perched
on
robert
s
wrist
and
the
party
of
explorers
prepared
to
enter
the
interior
the
grassy
slope
was
smooth
but
under
the
trees
there
were
tangled
creepers
with
bright
flowers
and
it
was
not
easy
to
walk
we
ought
to
have
an
explorer
s
axe
said
robert
i
shall
ask
father
to
give
me
one
for
there
were
curtains
of
creepers
with
scented
blossoms
hanging
from
the
trees
and
brilliant
birds
darted
about
quite
close
to
their
faces
now
tell
me
honestly
said
the
phoenix
are
there
any
birds
here
handsomer
than
i
am
don
t
be
afraid
of
hurting
my
feelings
i
m
a
modest
bird
i
not
one
of
them
said
robert
with
conviction
is
a
patch
upon
you
i
was
never
a
vain
bird
said
the
phoenix
but
i
own
that
you
confirm
my
own
impression
i
will
take
a
it
circled
in
the
air
for
a
moment
and
returning
to
robert
s
wrist
went
on
there
is
a
path
to
the
and
there
was
so
now
the
children
went
on
through
the
wood
more
quickly
and
comfortably
the
girls
picking
flowers
and
the
lamb
inviting
the
pretty
dickies
to
observe
that
he
himself
was
a
little
white
duck
and
all
this
time
he
hadn
t
once
the
path
turned
and
twisted
and
always
threading
their
way
amid
a
tangle
of
flowers
the
children
suddenly
passed
a
corner
and
found
themselves
in
a
forest
clearing
where
there
were
a
lot
of
pointed
huts
the
huts
as
they
knew
at
once
of
savages
the
boldest
heart
beat
more
quickly
suppose
they
were
cannibals
it
was
a
long
way
back
to
the
carpet
hadn
t
we
better
go
back
said
jane
go
now
she
said
and
her
voice
trembled
a
little
suppose
they
eat
nonsense
pussy
said
cyril
firmly
look
there
s
a
goat
tied
up
that
shows
they
don
t
eat
let
s
go
on
and
say
we
re
missionaries
robert
suggested
i
shouldn
t
advise
that
said
the
phoenix
very
earnestly
why
not
well
for
one
thing
it
isn
t
true
replied
the
golden
bird
it
was
while
they
stood
hesitating
on
the
edge
of
the
clearing
that
a
tall
man
suddenly
came
out
of
one
of
the
huts
he
had
hardly
any
clothes
and
his
body
all
over
was
a
dark
and
beautiful
coppery
colour
just
like
the
chrysanthemums
father
had
brought
home
on
saturday
in
his
hand
he
held
a
spear
the
whites
of
his
eyes
and
the
white
of
his
teeth
were
the
only
light
things
about
him
except
that
where
the
sun
shone
on
his
shiny
brown
body
it
looked
white
too
if
you
will
look
carefully
at
the
next
shiny
savage
you
meet
with
next
to
nothing
on
you
will
see
at
once
if
the
sun
happens
to
be
shining
at
the
time
that
i
am
right
about
this
the
savage
looked
at
the
children
concealment
was
impossible
he
uttered
a
shout
that
was
more
like
oo
goggery
than
anything
else
the
children
had
ever
heard
and
at
once
brown
coppery
people
leapt
out
of
every
hut
and
swarmed
like
ants
about
the
clearing
there
was
no
time
for
discussion
and
no
one
wanted
to
discuss
anything
anyhow
whether
these
coppery
people
were
cannibals
or
not
now
seemed
to
matter
very
little
without
an
instant
s
hesitation
the
four
children
turned
and
ran
back
along
the
forest
path
the
only
pause
was
anthea
s
she
stood
back
to
let
cyril
pass
because
he
was
carrying
the
lamb
who
screamed
with
delight
he
had
not
a
single
once
since
the
carpet
landed
him
on
the
island
squirrel
he
shouted
and
cyril
did
the
path
was
a
shorter
cut
to
the
beach
than
the
way
by
which
they
had
come
and
almost
directly
they
saw
through
the
trees
the
shining
of
sand
and
sea
stick
to
it
cried
cyril
breathlessly
they
did
stick
to
it
they
tore
down
the
sands
they
could
hear
behind
them
as
they
ran
the
patter
of
feet
which
they
knew
too
well
were
the
sands
were
golden
and
and
bare
there
were
wreaths
of
tropic
seaweed
there
were
rich
tropic
shells
of
the
kind
you
would
not
buy
in
the
kentish
town
road
under
at
least
fifteen
pence
a
pair
there
were
turtles
basking
lumpily
on
the
water
s
edge
but
no
cook
no
clothes
and
no
carpet
on
on
into
the
sea
gasped
cyril
they
must
hate
water
i
ve
heard
savages
always
their
feet
were
splashing
in
the
warm
shallows
before
his
breathless
words
were
ended
the
calm
were
easy
to
go
through
it
is
warm
work
running
for
your
life
in
the
tropics
and
the
coolness
of
the
water
was
delicious
they
were
up
to
their
now
and
jane
was
up
to
her
chin
look
said
the
phoenix
what
are
they
pointing
at
the
children
turned
and
there
a
little
to
the
west
was
a
head
a
head
they
knew
with
a
crooked
cap
upon
it
it
was
the
head
of
the
cook
for
some
reason
or
other
the
savages
had
stopped
at
the
water
s
edge
and
were
all
talking
at
the
top
of
their
voices
and
all
were
pointing
fingers
stiff
with
interest
and
excitement
at
the
head
of
the
cook
the
children
hurried
towards
her
as
quickly
as
the
water
would
let
them
what
on
earth
did
you
come
out
here
for
robert
shouted
and
where
on
earth
s
the
carpet
it
s
not
on
earth
bless
you
replied
the
cook
happily
it
s
under
me
in
the
water
i
got
a
bit
warm
setting
there
in
the
sun
and
i
just
says
i
wish
i
was
in
a
cold
bath
just
like
that
and
next
minute
here
i
was
it
s
all
part
of
the
every
one
at
once
saw
how
extremely
fortunate
it
was
that
the
carpet
had
had
the
sense
to
take
the
cook
to
the
nearest
and
largest
bath
the
sea
and
how
terrible
it
would
have
been
if
the
carpet
had
taken
itself
and
her
to
the
stuffy
little
of
the
house
in
camden
town
excuse
me
said
the
phoenix
s
soft
voice
breaking
in
on
the
general
sigh
of
relief
but
i
think
these
brown
people
want
your
to
to
eat
whispered
jane
as
well
as
she
could
through
the
water
which
the
plunging
lamb
was
dashing
in
her
face
with
happy
fat
hands
and
feet
hardly
rejoined
the
bird
who
wants
cooks
to
eat
cooks
are
engaged
not
eaten
they
wish
to
engage
how
can
you
understand
what
they
say
asked
cyril
doubtfully
it
s
as
easy
as
kissing
your
claw
replied
the
bird
i
speak
and
understand
all
languages
even
that
of
your
cook
which
is
difficult
and
unpleasing
it
s
quite
easy
when
you
know
how
it
s
done
it
just
comes
to
you
i
should
advise
you
to
beach
the
carpet
and
land
the
cargo
the
cook
i
mean
you
can
take
my
word
for
it
the
ones
will
not
harm
you
it
is
impossible
not
to
take
the
word
of
a
phoenix
when
it
tells
you
to
so
the
children
at
once
got
hold
of
the
corners
of
the
carpet
and
pulling
it
from
under
the
cook
towed
it
slowly
in
through
the
shallowing
water
and
at
last
spread
it
on
the
sand
the
cook
who
had
followed
instantly
sat
down
on
it
and
at
once
the
natives
now
strangely
humble
formed
a
ring
round
the
carpet
and
fell
on
their
faces
on
the
sand
the
tallest
savage
spoke
in
this
position
which
must
have
been
very
awkward
for
him
and
jane
noticed
that
it
took
him
quite
a
long
time
to
get
the
sand
out
of
his
mouth
afterwards
he
says
the
phoenix
remarked
after
some
time
that
they
wish
to
engage
your
cook
without
a
character
asked
anthea
who
had
heard
her
mother
speak
of
such
things
they
do
not
wish
to
engage
her
as
cook
but
as
queen
and
queens
need
not
have
there
was
a
breathless
pause
well
said
cyril
of
all
the
choices
but
there
s
no
accounting
for
every
one
laughed
at
the
idea
of
the
cook
s
being
engaged
as
queen
they
could
not
help
it
i
do
not
advise
laughter
warned
the
phoenix
ruffling
out
his
golden
feathers
which
were
extremely
wet
and
it
s
not
their
own
choice
it
seems
that
there
is
an
ancient
prophecy
of
this
tribe
that
a
great
queen
should
some
day
arise
out
of
the
sea
with
a
white
crown
on
her
head
and
and
well
you
see
there
s
the
crown
it
pointed
its
claw
at
cook
s
cap
and
a
very
dirty
cap
it
was
because
it
was
the
end
of
the
week
that
s
the
white
crown
it
said
at
least
it
s
nearly
white
very
white
indeed
compared
to
the
colour
they
are
and
anyway
it
s
quite
white
cyril
addressed
the
cook
look
here
said
he
these
brown
people
want
you
to
be
their
queen
they
re
only
savages
and
they
don
t
know
any
better
now
would
you
really
like
to
stay
or
if
you
ll
promise
not
to
be
so
jolly
aggravating
at
home
and
not
to
tell
any
one
a
word
about
we
ll
take
you
back
to
camden
no
you
don
t
said
the
cook
in
firm
undoubting
tones
i
ve
always
wanted
to
be
the
queen
god
bless
her
and
i
always
thought
what
a
good
one
i
should
make
and
now
i
m
going
to
if
it
s
only
in
a
dream
it
s
well
worth
while
and
i
don
t
go
back
to
that
nasty
underground
kitchen
and
me
blamed
for
everything
that
i
don
t
not
till
the
dream
s
finished
and
i
wake
up
with
that
nasty
bell
a
in
my
ears
so
i
tell
are
you
sure
anthea
anxiously
asked
the
phoenix
that
she
will
be
quite
safe
here
she
will
find
the
nest
of
a
queen
a
very
precious
and
soft
thing
said
the
bird
solemnly
there
you
hear
said
cyril
you
re
in
for
a
precious
soft
thing
so
mind
you
re
a
good
queen
cook
it
s
more
than
you
d
any
right
to
expect
but
long
may
you
some
of
the
cook
s
subjects
now
advanced
from
the
forest
with
long
garlands
of
beautiful
flowers
white
and
and
hung
them
respectfully
round
the
neck
of
their
new
sovereign
what
all
them
lovely
bokays
for
me
exclaimed
the
enraptured
cook
well
this
here
is
something
like
a
dream
i
must
she
sat
up
very
straight
on
the
carpet
and
the
ones
themselves
wreathed
in
garlands
of
the
gayest
flowers
madly
stuck
parrot
feathers
in
their
hair
and
began
to
dance
it
was
a
dance
such
as
you
have
never
seen
it
made
the
children
feel
almost
sure
that
the
cook
was
right
and
that
they
were
all
in
a
dream
small
drums
were
beaten
songs
were
sung
and
the
dance
got
faster
and
faster
and
odder
and
odder
till
at
last
all
the
dancers
fell
on
the
sand
tired
out
the
new
queen
with
her
white
all
on
one
side
clapped
wildly
brayvo
she
cried
brayvo
it
s
better
than
the
albert
edward
in
the
kentish
town
road
go
it
again
but
the
phoenix
would
not
translate
this
request
into
the
language
and
when
the
savages
had
recovered
their
breath
they
implored
their
queen
to
leave
her
white
escort
and
come
with
them
to
their
huts
the
finest
shall
be
yours
o
queen
said
they
well
so
long
said
the
cook
getting
heavily
on
to
her
feet
when
the
phoenix
had
translated
this
request
no
more
kitchens
and
attics
for
me
thank
you
i
m
off
to
my
royal
palace
i
am
and
i
only
wish
this
here
dream
would
keep
on
for
ever
and
she
picked
up
the
ends
of
the
garlands
that
trailed
round
her
feet
and
the
children
had
one
last
glimpse
of
her
striped
stockings
and
worn
boots
before
she
disappeared
into
the
shadow
of
the
forest
surrounded
by
her
dusky
retainers
singing
songs
of
rejoicing
as
they
went
well
said
cyril
i
suppose
she
s
all
right
but
they
don
t
seem
to
count
us
for
much
one
way
or
the
oh
said
the
phoenix
they
think
you
re
merely
dreams
the
prophecy
said
that
the
queen
would
arise
from
the
waves
with
a
white
crown
and
surrounded
by
white
that
s
about
what
they
think
you
are
and
what
about
dinner
said
robert
abruptly
there
won
t
be
any
dinner
with
no
cook
and
no
anthea
reminded
him
but
there
s
always
let
s
get
home
said
cyril
the
lamb
was
furiously
unwishful
to
be
dressed
in
his
warm
clothes
again
but
anthea
and
jane
managed
it
by
force
disguised
as
coaxing
and
he
never
once
then
every
one
put
on
its
own
warm
things
and
took
its
place
on
the
carpet
a
sound
of
uncouth
singing
still
came
from
beyond
the
trees
where
the
natives
were
crooning
songs
of
admiration
and
respect
to
their
queen
then
anthea
said
home
just
as
duchesses
and
other
people
do
to
their
coachmen
and
the
intelligent
carpet
in
one
whirling
moment
laid
itself
down
in
its
proper
place
on
the
nursery
floor
and
at
that
very
moment
eliza
opened
the
door
and
said
cook
s
gone
i
can
t
find
her
anywhere
and
there
s
no
dinner
ready
she
hasn
t
taken
her
box
nor
yet
her
outdoor
things
she
just
ran
out
to
see
the
time
i
shouldn
t
wonder
the
kitchen
clock
never
did
give
her
satisfaction
and
she
s
got
run
over
or
fell
down
in
a
fit
as
likely
as
not
you
ll
have
to
put
up
with
the
cold
bacon
for
your
dinners
and
what
on
earth
you
ve
got
your
outdoor
things
on
for
i
don
t
know
and
then
i
ll
slip
out
and
see
if
they
know
anything
about
her
at
the
but
nobody
ever
knew
anything
about
the
cook
any
more
except
the
children
and
later
one
other
person
mother
was
so
upset
at
losing
the
cook
and
so
anxious
about
her
that
anthea
felt
most
miserable
as
though
she
had
done
something
very
wrong
indeed
she
woke
several
times
in
the
night
and
at
last
decided
that
she
would
ask
the
phoenix
to
let
her
tell
her
mother
all
about
it
but
there
was
no
opportunity
to
do
this
next
day
because
the
phoenix
as
usual
had
gone
to
sleep
in
some
spot
after
asking
as
a
special
favour
not
to
be
disturbed
for
hours
the
lamb
never
once
all
that
sunday
and
mother
and
father
said
what
good
medicine
it
was
that
the
doctor
had
given
him
but
the
children
knew
that
it
was
the
southern
shore
where
you
can
t
have
that
had
cured
him
the
lamb
babbled
of
coloured
sand
and
water
but
no
one
took
any
notice
of
that
he
often
talked
of
things
that
hadn
t
happened
it
was
on
monday
morning
very
early
indeed
that
anthea
woke
and
suddenly
made
up
her
mind
she
crept
downstairs
in
her
it
was
very
chilly
sat
down
on
the
carpet
and
with
a
beating
heart
wished
herself
on
the
sunny
shore
where
you
can
t
have
and
next
moment
there
she
was
the
sand
was
splendidly
warm
she
could
feel
it
at
once
even
through
the
carpet
she
folded
the
carpet
and
put
it
over
her
shoulders
like
a
shawl
for
she
was
determined
not
to
be
parted
from
it
for
a
single
instant
no
matter
how
hot
it
might
be
to
wear
then
trembling
a
little
and
trying
to
keep
up
her
courage
by
saying
over
and
over
it
is
my
duty
it
is
my
duty
she
went
up
the
forest
path
well
here
you
are
again
said
the
cook
directly
she
saw
anthea
this
dream
does
keep
on
the
cook
was
dressed
in
a
white
robe
she
had
no
shoes
and
stockings
and
no
cap
and
she
was
sitting
under
a
screen
of
for
it
was
afternoon
in
the
island
and
blazing
hot
she
wore
a
flower
wreath
on
her
hair
and
boys
were
fanning
her
with
peacock
s
feathers
they
ve
got
the
cap
put
away
she
said
they
seem
to
think
a
lot
of
it
never
saw
one
before
i
are
you
happy
asked
anthea
panting
the
sight
of
the
cook
as
queen
quite
took
her
breath
away
i
believe
you
my
dear
said
the
cook
heartily
nothing
to
do
unless
you
want
to
but
i
m
getting
rested
now
tomorrow
i
m
going
to
start
cleaning
out
my
hut
if
the
dream
keeps
on
and
i
shall
teach
them
cooking
they
burns
everything
to
a
cinder
now
unless
they
eats
it
but
can
you
talk
to
them
lor
love
a
duck
yes
the
happy
replied
it
s
quite
easy
to
pick
up
i
always
thought
i
should
be
quick
at
foreign
languages
i
ve
taught
them
to
understand
dinner
and
i
want
a
drink
and
you
leave
me
be
then
you
don
t
want
anything
anthea
asked
earnestly
and
anxiously
not
me
miss
except
if
you
d
only
go
away
i
m
afraid
of
me
waking
up
with
that
bell
if
you
keep
on
stopping
here
to
me
long
as
this
here
dream
keeps
up
i
m
as
happy
as
a
goodbye
then
said
anthea
gaily
for
her
conscience
was
clear
now
she
hurried
into
the
wood
threw
herself
on
the
ground
and
said
home
and
there
she
was
rolled
in
the
carpet
on
the
nursery
floor
she
s
all
right
anyhow
said
anthea
and
went
back
to
bed
i
m
glad
somebody
s
pleased
but
mother
will
never
believe
me
when
i
tell
the
story
is
indeed
a
little
difficult
to
believe
still
you
might
try
chapter
two
bazaars
mother
was
really
a
great
dear
she
was
pretty
and
she
was
loving
and
most
frightfully
good
when
you
were
ill
and
always
kind
and
almost
always
just
that
is
she
was
just
when
she
understood
things
but
of
course
she
did
not
always
understand
things
no
one
understands
everything
and
mothers
are
not
angels
though
a
good
many
of
them
come
pretty
near
it
the
children
knew
that
mother
always
wanted
to
do
what
was
best
for
them
even
if
she
was
not
clever
enough
to
know
exactly
what
was
the
best
that
was
why
all
of
them
but
much
more
particularly
anthea
felt
rather
uncomfortable
at
keeping
the
great
secret
from
her
of
the
wishing
carpet
and
the
phoenix
and
anthea
whose
inside
mind
was
made
so
that
she
was
able
to
be
much
more
uncomfortable
than
the
others
had
decided
that
she
must
tell
her
mother
the
truth
however
little
likely
it
was
that
her
mother
would
believe
it
then
i
shall
have
done
what
s
right
said
she
to
the
phoenix
and
if
she
doesn
t
believe
me
it
won
t
be
my
fault
will
it
not
in
the
least
said
the
golden
bird
and
she
won
t
so
you
re
quite
anthea
chose
a
time
when
she
was
doing
her
they
were
algebra
and
latin
german
english
and
euclid
and
she
asked
her
mother
whether
she
might
come
and
do
them
in
the
so
as
to
be
quiet
she
said
to
her
mother
and
to
herself
she
said
and
that
s
not
the
real
reason
i
hope
i
shan
t
grow
up
a
mother
said
of
course
dearie
and
anthea
started
swimming
through
a
sea
of
x
s
and
y
s
and
z
s
mother
was
sitting
at
the
mahogany
bureau
writing
letters
mother
dear
said
anthea
yes
said
mother
about
cook
said
anthea
know
where
she
do
you
dear
said
mother
well
i
wouldn
t
take
her
back
after
the
way
she
has
it
s
not
her
fault
said
anthea
may
i
tell
you
about
it
from
the
beginning
mother
laid
down
her
pen
and
her
nice
face
had
a
resigned
expression
as
you
know
a
resigned
expression
always
makes
you
want
not
to
tell
anybody
anything
it
s
like
this
said
anthea
in
a
hurry
that
egg
you
know
that
came
in
the
carpet
we
put
it
in
the
fire
and
it
hatched
into
the
phoenix
and
the
carpet
was
a
wishing
carpet
and
a
very
nice
game
darling
said
mother
taking
up
her
pen
now
do
be
quiet
i
ve
got
a
lot
of
letters
to
write
i
m
going
to
bournemouth
with
the
lamb
and
there
s
that
anthea
went
back
to
x
y
z
and
mother
s
pen
scratched
busily
but
mother
said
anthea
when
mother
put
down
the
pen
to
lick
an
envelope
the
carpet
takes
us
wherever
we
like
and
i
wish
it
would
take
you
where
you
could
get
a
few
nice
eastern
things
for
my
bazaar
said
mother
i
promised
them
and
i
ve
no
time
to
go
to
liberty
s
it
shall
said
anthea
but
mother
well
dear
said
mother
a
little
impatiently
for
she
had
taken
up
her
pen
again
the
carpet
took
us
to
a
place
where
you
couldn
t
have
and
the
lamb
hasn
t
whooped
since
and
we
took
cook
because
she
was
so
tiresome
and
then
she
would
stay
and
be
queen
of
the
savages
they
thought
her
cap
was
a
crown
and
darling
one
said
mother
you
know
i
love
to
hear
the
things
you
make
up
but
i
am
most
awfully
but
it
s
true
said
anthea
desperately
you
shouldn
t
say
that
my
sweet
said
mother
gently
and
then
anthea
knew
it
was
hopeless
are
you
going
away
for
long
asked
anthea
i
ve
got
a
cold
said
mother
and
daddy
s
anxious
about
it
and
the
lamb
s
he
hasn
t
coughed
since
saturday
the
lamb
s
eldest
sister
interrupted
i
wish
i
could
think
so
mother
replied
and
daddy
s
got
to
go
to
scotland
i
do
hope
you
ll
be
good
we
will
we
will
said
anthea
fervently
when
s
the
bazaar
on
saturday
said
mother
at
the
schools
oh
don
t
talk
any
more
there
s
a
treasure
my
head
s
going
round
and
i
ve
forgotten
how
to
spell
mother
and
the
lamb
went
away
and
father
went
away
and
there
was
a
new
cook
who
looked
so
like
a
frightened
rabbit
that
no
one
had
the
heart
to
do
anything
to
frighten
her
any
more
than
seemed
natural
to
her
the
phoenix
begged
to
be
excused
it
said
it
wanted
a
week
s
rest
and
asked
that
it
might
not
be
disturbed
and
it
hid
its
golden
gleaming
self
and
nobody
could
find
it
so
that
when
wednesday
afternoon
brought
an
unexpected
holiday
and
every
one
decided
to
go
somewhere
on
the
carpet
the
journey
had
to
be
undertaken
without
the
phoenix
they
were
debarred
from
any
carpet
excursions
in
the
evening
by
a
sudden
promise
to
mother
exacted
in
the
agitation
of
parting
that
they
would
not
be
out
after
six
at
night
except
on
saturday
when
they
were
to
go
to
the
bazaar
and
were
pledged
to
put
on
their
best
clothes
to
wash
themselves
to
the
uttermost
and
to
clean
their
nails
not
with
scissors
which
are
scratchy
and
bad
but
with
ends
of
wooden
matches
which
do
no
harm
to
any
one
s
nails
let
s
go
and
see
the
lamb
said
jane
but
every
one
was
agreed
that
if
they
appeared
suddenly
in
bournemouth
it
would
frighten
mother
out
of
her
wits
if
not
into
a
fit
so
they
sat
on
the
carpet
and
thought
and
thought
and
thought
till
they
almost
began
to
squint
look
here
said
cyril
i
know
please
carpet
take
us
somewhere
where
we
can
see
the
lamb
and
mother
and
no
one
can
see
except
the
lamb
said
jane
quickly
and
the
next
moment
they
found
themselves
recovering
from
the
movement
and
there
they
were
sitting
on
the
carpet
and
the
carpet
was
laid
out
over
another
thick
soft
carpet
of
brown
there
were
green
overhead
and
a
swift
clear
little
stream
was
running
as
fast
as
ever
it
could
between
steep
banks
and
there
sitting
on
the
carpet
was
mother
without
her
hat
and
the
sun
was
shining
brightly
although
it
was
november
and
there
was
the
lamb
as
jolly
as
jolly
and
not
whooping
at
all
the
carpet
s
deceived
us
said
robert
gloomily
mother
will
see
us
directly
she
turns
her
but
the
faithful
carpet
had
not
deceived
them
mother
turned
her
dear
head
and
looked
straight
at
them
and
did
not
see
them
we
re
invisible
cyril
whispered
what
awful
larks
but
to
the
girls
it
was
not
larks
at
all
it
was
horrible
to
have
mother
looking
straight
at
them
and
her
face
keeping
the
same
just
as
though
they
weren
t
there
i
don
t
like
it
said
jane
mother
never
looked
at
us
like
that
before
just
as
if
she
didn
t
love
us
as
if
we
were
somebody
else
s
children
and
not
very
nice
ones
either
as
if
she
didn
t
care
whether
she
saw
us
or
it
is
horrid
said
anthea
almost
in
tears
but
at
this
moment
the
lamb
saw
them
and
plunged
towards
the
carpet
shrieking
panty
own
panty
an
pussy
an
squiggle
an
bobs
oh
oh
anthea
caught
him
and
kissed
him
so
did
jane
they
could
not
help
it
he
looked
such
a
darling
with
his
blue
hat
all
on
one
side
and
his
precious
face
all
dirty
quite
in
the
old
familiar
way
i
love
you
panty
i
love
you
and
you
and
you
and
you
cried
the
lamb
it
was
a
delicious
moment
even
the
boys
thumped
their
baby
brother
joyously
on
the
back
then
anthea
glanced
at
mother
and
mother
s
face
was
a
pale
colour
and
she
was
staring
at
the
lamb
as
if
she
thought
he
had
gone
mad
and
indeed
that
was
exactly
what
she
did
think
my
lamb
my
precious
come
to
mother
she
cried
and
jumped
up
and
ran
to
the
baby
she
was
so
quick
that
the
invisible
children
had
to
leap
back
or
she
would
have
felt
them
and
to
feel
what
you
can
t
see
is
the
worst
sort
of
mother
picked
up
the
lamb
and
hurried
away
from
the
pinewood
let
s
go
home
said
jane
after
a
miserable
silence
it
feels
just
exactly
as
if
mother
didn
t
love
but
they
couldn
t
bear
to
go
home
till
they
had
seen
mother
meet
another
lady
and
knew
that
she
was
safe
you
can
not
leave
your
mother
to
go
green
in
the
face
in
a
distant
pinewood
far
from
all
human
aid
and
then
go
home
on
your
wishing
carpet
as
though
nothing
had
happened
when
mother
seemed
safe
the
children
returned
to
the
carpet
and
said
home
and
home
they
went
i
don
t
care
about
being
invisible
myself
said
cyril
at
least
not
with
my
own
family
it
would
be
different
if
you
were
a
prince
or
a
bandit
or
a
and
now
the
thoughts
of
all
four
dwelt
fondly
on
the
dear
greenish
face
of
mother
i
wish
she
hadn
t
gone
away
said
jane
the
house
is
simply
beastly
without
i
think
we
ought
to
do
what
she
said
anthea
put
in
i
saw
something
in
a
book
the
other
day
about
the
wishes
of
the
departed
being
that
means
when
they
ve
departed
farther
off
said
cyril
india
s
coral
or
greenland
s
icy
don
t
you
know
not
bournemouth
besides
we
don
t
know
what
her
wishes
she
said
anthea
was
very
much
inclined
to
cry
she
said
get
indian
things
for
my
bazaar
but
i
know
she
thought
we
couldn
t
and
it
was
only
let
s
get
them
all
the
same
said
robert
we
ll
go
the
first
thing
on
saturday
and
on
saturday
morning
the
first
thing
they
went
there
was
no
finding
the
phoenix
so
they
sat
on
the
beautiful
wishing
carpet
and
said
we
want
indian
things
for
mother
s
bazaar
will
you
please
take
us
where
people
will
give
us
heaps
of
indian
things
the
docile
carpet
swirled
their
senses
away
and
restored
them
on
the
outskirts
of
a
gleaming
white
indian
town
they
knew
it
was
indian
at
once
by
the
shape
of
the
domes
and
roofs
and
besides
a
man
went
by
on
an
elephant
and
two
english
soldiers
went
along
the
road
talking
like
in
mr
kipling
s
books
so
after
that
no
one
could
have
any
doubt
as
to
where
they
were
they
rolled
up
the
carpet
and
robert
carried
it
and
they
walked
bodily
into
the
town
it
was
very
warm
and
once
more
they
had
to
take
off
their
coats
and
carry
them
on
their
arms
the
streets
were
narrow
and
strange
and
the
clothes
of
the
people
in
the
streets
were
stranger
and
the
talk
of
the
people
was
strangest
of
all
i
can
t
understand
a
word
said
cyril
how
on
earth
are
we
to
ask
for
things
for
our
bazaar
and
they
re
poor
people
too
said
jane
i
m
sure
they
are
what
we
want
is
a
rajah
or
robert
was
beginning
to
unroll
the
carpet
but
the
others
stopped
him
imploring
him
not
to
waste
a
wish
we
asked
the
carpet
to
take
us
where
we
could
get
indian
things
for
bazaars
said
anthea
and
it
her
faith
was
justified
just
as
she
finished
speaking
a
very
brown
gentleman
in
a
turban
came
up
to
them
and
bowed
deeply
he
spoke
and
they
thrilled
to
the
sound
of
english
words
my
ranee
she
think
you
very
nice
childs
she
asks
do
you
lose
yourselves
and
do
you
desire
to
sell
carpet
she
see
you
from
her
palkee
you
come
see
her
yes
they
followed
the
stranger
who
seemed
to
have
a
great
many
more
teeth
in
his
smile
than
are
usual
and
he
led
them
through
crooked
streets
to
the
ranee
s
palace
i
am
not
going
to
describe
the
ranee
s
palace
because
i
really
have
never
seen
the
palace
of
a
ranee
and
mr
kipling
has
so
you
can
read
about
it
in
his
books
but
i
know
exactly
what
happened
there
the
old
ranee
sat
on
a
seat
and
there
were
a
lot
of
other
ladies
with
her
all
in
trousers
and
veils
and
sparkling
with
tinsel
and
gold
and
jewels
and
the
brown
turbaned
gentleman
stood
behind
a
sort
of
carved
screen
and
interpreted
what
the
children
said
and
what
the
queen
said
and
when
the
queen
asked
to
buy
the
carpet
the
children
said
why
asked
the
ranee
and
jane
briefly
said
why
and
the
interpreter
interpreted
the
queen
spoke
and
then
the
interpreter
said
my
mistress
says
it
is
a
good
story
and
you
tell
it
all
through
without
thought
of
and
they
had
to
it
made
a
long
story
especially
as
it
had
all
to
be
told
twice
once
by
cyril
and
once
by
the
interpreter
cyril
rather
enjoyed
himself
he
warmed
to
his
work
and
told
the
tale
of
the
phoenix
and
the
carpet
and
the
lone
tower
and
the
in
language
that
grew
insensibly
more
and
more
arabian
nightsy
and
the
ranee
and
her
ladies
listened
to
the
interpreter
and
rolled
about
on
their
fat
cushions
with
laughter
when
the
story
was
ended
she
spoke
and
the
interpreter
explained
that
she
had
said
little
one
thou
art
a
teller
of
tales
and
she
threw
him
a
string
of
turquoises
from
round
her
neck
oh
how
lovely
cried
jane
and
anthea
cyril
bowed
several
times
and
then
cleared
his
throat
and
said
thank
her
very
very
much
but
i
would
much
rather
she
gave
me
some
of
the
cheap
things
in
the
bazaar
tell
her
i
want
them
to
sell
again
and
give
the
money
to
buy
clothes
for
poor
people
who
haven
t
tell
him
he
has
my
leave
to
sell
my
gift
and
clothe
the
naked
with
its
price
said
the
queen
when
this
was
translated
but
cyril
said
very
firmly
no
thank
you
the
things
have
got
to
be
sold
at
our
bazaar
and
no
one
would
buy
a
turquoise
necklace
at
an
english
bazaar
they
d
think
it
was
sham
or
else
they
d
want
to
know
where
we
got
so
then
the
queen
sent
out
for
little
pretty
things
and
her
servants
piled
the
carpet
with
them
i
must
needs
lend
you
an
elephant
to
carry
them
away
she
said
laughing
but
anthea
said
if
the
queen
will
lend
us
a
comb
and
let
us
wash
our
hands
and
faces
she
shall
see
a
magic
thing
we
and
the
carpet
and
all
these
brass
trays
and
pots
and
carved
things
and
stuffs
and
things
will
just
vanish
away
like
the
queen
clapped
her
hands
at
this
idea
and
lent
the
children
a
comb
inlaid
with
ivory
and
they
washed
their
faces
and
hands
in
silver
basins
then
cyril
made
a
very
polite
farewell
speech
and
quite
suddenly
he
ended
with
the
words
and
i
wish
we
were
at
the
bazaar
at
our
and
of
course
they
were
and
the
queen
and
her
ladies
were
left
with
their
mouths
open
gazing
at
the
bare
space
on
the
inlaid
marble
floor
where
the
carpet
and
the
children
had
been
that
is
magic
if
ever
magic
was
said
the
queen
delighted
with
the
incident
which
indeed
has
given
the
ladies
of
that
court
something
to
talk
about
on
wet
days
ever
since
cyril
s
stories
had
taken
some
time
so
had
the
meal
of
strange
sweet
foods
that
they
had
had
while
the
little
pretty
things
were
being
bought
and
the
gas
in
the
schoolroom
was
already
lighted
outside
the
winter
dusk
was
stealing
down
among
the
camden
town
houses
i
m
glad
we
got
washed
in
india
said
cyril
we
should
have
been
awfully
late
if
we
d
had
to
go
home
and
besides
robert
said
it
s
much
warmer
washing
in
india
i
shouldn
t
mind
it
so
much
if
we
lived
the
thoughtful
carpet
had
dumped
the
children
down
in
a
dusky
space
behind
the
point
where
the
corners
of
two
stalls
met
the
floor
was
littered
with
string
and
brown
paper
and
baskets
and
boxes
were
heaped
along
the
wall
the
children
crept
out
under
a
stall
covered
with
all
sorts
of
and
mats
and
things
embroidered
beautifully
by
idle
ladies
with
no
real
work
to
do
they
got
out
at
the
end
displacing
a
adorned
with
a
tasteful
pattern
of
blue
geraniums
the
girls
got
out
unobserved
so
did
cyril
but
robert
as
he
cautiously
emerged
was
actually
walked
on
by
mrs
biddle
who
kept
the
stall
her
large
solid
foot
stood
firmly
on
the
small
solid
hand
of
robert
and
who
can
blame
robert
if
he
did
yell
a
little
a
crowd
instantly
collected
yells
are
very
unusual
at
bazaars
and
every
one
was
intensely
interested
it
was
several
seconds
before
the
three
free
children
could
make
mrs
biddle
understand
that
what
she
was
walking
on
was
not
a
schoolroom
floor
or
even
as
she
presently
supposed
a
dropped
but
the
living
hand
of
a
suffering
child
when
she
became
aware
that
she
really
had
hurt
him
she
grew
very
angry
indeed
when
people
have
hurt
other
people
by
accident
the
one
who
does
the
hurting
is
always
much
the
angriest
i
wonder
why
i
m
very
sorry
i
m
sure
said
mrs
biddle
but
she
spoke
more
in
anger
than
in
sorrow
come
out
whatever
do
you
mean
by
creeping
about
under
the
stalls
like
earwigs
we
were
looking
at
the
things
in
the
such
nasty
prying
ways
said
mrs
biddle
will
never
make
you
successful
in
life
there
s
nothing
there
but
packing
and
oh
isn
t
there
said
jane
that
s
all
you
little
girl
don
t
be
rude
said
mrs
biddle
flushing
violet
she
doesn
t
mean
to
be
but
there
are
some
nice
things
there
all
the
same
said
cyril
who
suddenly
felt
how
impossible
it
was
to
inform
the
listening
crowd
that
all
the
treasures
piled
on
the
carpet
were
mother
s
contributions
to
the
bazaar
no
one
would
believe
it
and
if
they
did
and
wrote
to
thank
mother
she
would
think
well
goodness
only
knew
what
she
would
think
the
other
three
children
felt
the
same
i
should
like
to
see
them
said
a
very
nice
lady
whose
friends
had
disappointed
her
and
who
hoped
that
these
might
be
belated
contributions
to
her
poorly
furnished
stall
she
looked
inquiringly
at
robert
who
said
with
pleasure
don
t
mention
it
and
dived
back
under
mrs
biddle
s
stall
i
wonder
you
encourage
such
behaviour
said
mrs
biddle
i
always
speak
my
mind
as
you
know
miss
peasmarsh
and
i
must
say
i
am
she
turned
to
the
crowd
there
is
no
entertainment
here
she
said
sternly
a
very
naughty
little
boy
has
accidentally
hurt
himself
but
only
slightly
will
you
please
disperse
it
will
only
encourage
him
in
naughtiness
if
he
finds
himself
the
centre
of
the
crowd
slowly
dispersed
anthea
speechless
with
fury
heard
a
nice
curate
say
poor
little
beggar
and
loved
the
curate
at
once
and
for
ever
then
robert
wriggled
out
from
under
the
stall
with
some
benares
brass
and
some
inlaid
sandalwood
boxes
liberty
cried
miss
peasmarsh
then
charles
has
not
forgotten
after
excuse
me
said
mrs
biddle
with
fierce
politeness
these
objects
are
deposited
behind
my
stall
some
unknown
donor
who
does
good
by
stealth
and
would
blush
if
he
could
hear
you
claim
the
things
of
course
they
are
for
my
stall
touches
yours
at
the
corner
said
poor
miss
peasmarsh
timidly
and
my
cousin
did
promise
the
children
sidled
away
from
the
unequal
contest
and
mingled
with
the
crowd
their
feelings
were
too
deep
for
words
till
at
last
robert
said
that
pig
and
after
all
our
trouble
i
m
hoarse
with
gassing
to
that
trousered
lady
in
the
s
very
very
nasty
said
jane
it
was
anthea
who
said
in
a
hurried
undertone
she
isn
t
very
nice
and
miss
peasmarsh
is
pretty
and
nice
too
who
s
got
a
pencil
it
was
a
long
crawl
under
three
stalls
but
anthea
did
it
a
large
piece
of
pale
blue
paper
lay
among
the
rubbish
in
the
corner
she
folded
it
to
a
square
and
wrote
upon
it
licking
the
pencil
at
every
word
to
make
it
mark
quite
blackly
all
these
indian
things
are
for
pretty
nice
miss
peasmarsh
s
she
thought
of
adding
there
is
nothing
for
mrs
biddle
but
she
saw
that
this
might
lead
to
suspicion
so
she
wrote
hastily
from
an
unknown
donna
and
crept
back
among
the
boards
and
trestles
to
join
the
others
so
that
when
mrs
biddle
appealed
to
the
bazaar
committee
and
the
corner
of
the
stall
was
lifted
and
shifted
so
that
stout
clergymen
and
heavy
ladies
could
get
to
the
corner
without
creeping
under
stalls
the
blue
paper
was
discovered
and
all
the
splendid
shining
indian
things
were
given
over
to
miss
peasmarsh
and
she
sold
them
all
and
got
pounds
for
them
i
don
t
understand
about
that
blue
paper
said
mrs
biddle
it
looks
to
me
like
the
work
of
a
lunatic
and
saying
you
were
nice
and
pretty
it
s
not
the
work
of
a
sane
anthea
and
jane
begged
miss
peasmarsh
to
let
them
help
her
to
sell
the
things
because
it
was
their
brother
who
had
announced
the
good
news
that
the
things
had
come
miss
peasmarsh
was
very
willing
for
now
her
stall
that
had
been
so
neglected
was
surrounded
by
people
who
wanted
to
buy
and
she
was
glad
to
be
helped
the
children
noted
that
mrs
biddle
had
not
more
to
do
in
the
way
of
selling
than
she
could
manage
quite
well
i
hope
they
were
not
glad
for
you
should
forgive
your
enemies
even
if
they
walk
on
your
hands
and
then
say
it
is
all
your
naughty
fault
but
i
am
afraid
they
were
not
so
sorry
as
they
ought
to
have
been
it
took
some
time
to
arrange
the
things
on
the
stall
the
carpet
was
spread
over
it
and
the
dark
colours
showed
up
the
brass
and
silver
and
ivory
things
it
was
a
happy
and
busy
afternoon
and
when
miss
peasmarsh
and
the
girls
had
sold
every
single
one
of
the
little
pretty
things
from
the
indian
bazaar
far
far
away
anthea
and
jane
went
off
with
the
boys
to
fish
in
the
fishpond
and
dive
into
the
and
hear
the
cardboard
band
and
the
phonograph
and
the
chorus
of
singing
birds
that
was
done
behind
a
screen
with
glass
tubes
and
glasses
of
water
they
had
a
beautiful
tea
suddenly
presented
to
them
by
the
nice
curate
and
miss
peasmarsh
joined
them
before
they
had
had
more
than
three
cakes
each
it
was
a
merry
party
and
the
curate
was
extremely
pleasant
to
every
one
even
to
miss
peasmarsh
as
jane
said
afterwards
we
ought
to
get
back
to
the
stall
said
anthea
when
no
one
could
possibly
eat
any
more
and
the
curate
was
talking
in
a
low
voice
to
miss
peas
marsh
about
after
easter
there
s
nothing
to
go
back
for
said
miss
peasmarsh
gaily
thanks
to
you
dear
children
we
ve
sold
there
there
s
the
carpet
said
cyril
oh
said
miss
peasmarsh
radiantly
don
t
bother
about
the
carpet
i
ve
sold
even
that
mrs
biddle
gave
me
ten
shillings
for
it
she
said
it
would
do
for
her
servant
s
why
said
jane
her
servants
don
t
have
carpets
we
had
cook
from
her
and
she
told
us
no
scandal
about
queen
elizabeth
if
you
please
said
the
curate
cheerfully
and
miss
peasmarsh
laughed
and
looked
at
him
as
though
she
had
never
dreamed
that
any
one
could
be
so
amusing
but
the
others
were
struck
dumb
how
could
they
say
the
carpet
is
ours
for
who
brings
carpets
to
bazaars
the
children
were
now
thoroughly
wretched
but
i
am
glad
to
say
that
their
wretchedness
did
not
make
them
forget
their
manners
as
it
does
sometimes
even
with
people
who
ought
to
know
ever
so
much
better
they
said
thank
you
very
much
for
the
jolly
tea
and
thanks
for
being
so
jolly
and
thanks
awfully
for
giving
us
such
a
jolly
time
for
the
curate
had
stood
and
and
phonographs
and
the
chorus
of
singing
birds
and
had
stood
them
like
a
man
the
girls
hugged
miss
peasmarsh
and
as
they
went
away
they
heard
the
curate
say
jolly
little
kids
yes
but
what
about
you
will
let
it
be
directly
after
easter
ah
do
say
you
will
and
jane
ran
back
and
said
before
anthea
could
drag
her
away
what
are
you
going
to
do
after
easter
miss
peasmarsh
smiled
and
looked
very
pretty
indeed
and
the
curate
said
i
hope
i
am
going
to
take
a
trip
to
the
fortunate
i
wish
we
could
take
you
on
the
wishing
carpet
said
jane
thank
you
said
the
curate
but
i
m
afraid
i
can
t
wait
for
that
i
must
go
to
the
fortunate
islands
before
they
make
me
a
bishop
i
should
have
no
time
i
ve
always
thought
i
should
marry
a
bishop
said
jane
his
aprons
would
come
in
so
useful
wouldn
t
you
like
to
marry
a
bishop
miss
peasmarsh
it
was
then
that
they
dragged
her
away
as
it
was
robert
s
hand
that
mrs
biddle
had
walked
on
it
was
decided
that
he
had
better
not
recall
the
incident
to
her
mind
and
so
make
her
angry
again
anthea
and
jane
had
helped
to
sell
things
at
the
rival
stall
so
they
were
not
likely
to
be
popular
a
hasty
council
of
four
decided
that
mrs
biddle
would
hate
cyril
less
than
she
would
hate
the
others
so
the
others
mingled
with
the
crowd
and
it
was
he
who
said
to
her
mrs
biddle
we
meant
to
have
that
carpet
would
you
sell
it
to
us
we
would
give
you
certainly
not
said
mrs
biddle
go
away
little
there
was
that
in
her
tone
which
showed
cyril
all
too
plainly
the
hopelessness
of
persuasion
he
found
the
others
and
said
it
s
no
use
she
s
like
a
lioness
robbed
of
its
puppies
we
must
watch
where
it
goes
and
anthea
i
don
t
care
what
you
say
it
s
our
own
carpet
it
wouldn
t
be
burglary
it
would
be
a
sort
of
forlorn
hope
rescue
party
heroic
and
daring
and
dashing
and
not
wrong
at
the
children
still
wandered
among
the
gay
crowd
but
there
was
no
pleasure
there
for
them
any
more
the
chorus
of
singing
birds
sounded
just
like
glass
tubes
being
blown
through
water
and
the
phonograph
simply
made
a
horrid
noise
so
that
you
could
hardly
hear
yourself
speak
and
the
people
were
buying
things
they
couldn
t
possibly
want
and
it
all
seemed
very
stupid
and
mrs
biddle
had
bought
the
wishing
carpet
for
ten
shillings
and
the
whole
of
life
was
sad
and
grey
and
dusty
and
smelt
of
slight
gas
escapes
and
hot
people
and
cake
and
crumbs
and
all
the
children
were
very
tired
indeed
they
found
a
corner
within
sight
of
the
carpet
and
there
they
waited
miserably
till
it
was
far
beyond
their
proper
bedtime
and
when
it
was
ten
the
people
who
had
bought
things
went
away
but
the
people
who
had
been
selling
stayed
to
count
up
their
money
and
to
jaw
about
it
said
robert
i
ll
never
go
to
another
bazaar
as
long
as
ever
i
live
my
hand
is
swollen
as
big
as
a
pudding
i
expect
the
nails
in
her
horrible
boots
were
just
then
some
one
who
seemed
to
have
a
right
to
interfere
said
everything
is
over
now
you
had
better
go
so
they
went
and
then
they
waited
on
the
pavement
under
the
gas
lamp
where
ragged
children
had
been
standing
all
the
evening
to
listen
to
the
band
and
their
feet
slipped
about
in
the
greasy
mud
till
mrs
biddle
came
out
and
was
driven
away
in
a
cab
with
the
many
things
she
hadn
t
sold
and
the
few
things
she
had
bought
among
others
the
carpet
the
other
left
their
things
at
the
school
till
monday
morning
but
mrs
biddle
was
afraid
some
one
would
steal
some
of
them
so
she
took
them
in
a
cab
the
children
now
too
desperate
to
care
for
mud
or
appearances
hung
on
behind
the
cab
till
it
reached
mrs
biddle
s
house
when
she
and
the
carpet
had
gone
in
and
the
door
was
shut
anthea
said
don
t
let
s
burgle
i
mean
do
daring
and
dashing
rescue
acts
till
we
ve
given
her
a
chance
let
s
ring
and
ask
to
see
the
others
hated
to
do
this
but
at
last
they
agreed
on
condition
that
anthea
would
not
make
any
silly
fuss
about
the
burglary
afterwards
if
it
really
had
to
come
to
that
so
they
knocked
and
rang
and
a
parlourmaid
opened
the
front
door
while
they
were
asking
for
mrs
biddle
they
saw
her
she
was
in
the
and
she
had
already
pushed
back
the
table
and
spread
out
the
carpet
to
see
how
it
looked
on
the
floor
i
knew
she
didn
t
want
it
for
her
servants
bedroom
jane
muttered
anthea
walked
straight
past
the
uncomfortable
parlourmaid
and
the
others
followed
her
mrs
biddle
had
her
back
to
them
and
was
smoothing
down
the
carpet
with
the
same
boot
that
had
trampled
on
the
hand
of
robert
so
that
they
were
all
in
the
room
and
cyril
with
great
presence
of
mind
had
shut
the
room
door
before
she
saw
them
who
is
it
jane
she
asked
in
a
sour
voice
and
then
turning
suddenly
she
saw
who
it
was
once
more
her
face
grew
violet
a
deep
dark
violet
you
wicked
daring
little
things
she
cried
how
dare
you
come
here
at
this
time
of
night
too
be
off
or
i
ll
send
for
the
don
t
be
angry
said
anthea
soothingly
we
only
wanted
to
ask
you
to
let
us
have
the
carpet
we
have
quite
twelve
shillings
between
us
and
how
dare
you
cried
mrs
biddle
and
her
voice
shook
with
angriness
you
do
look
horrid
said
jane
suddenly
mrs
biddle
actually
stamped
that
booted
foot
of
hers
you
rude
barefaced
child
she
said
anthea
almost
shook
jane
but
jane
pushed
forward
in
spite
of
her
it
really
is
our
nursery
carpet
she
said
you
ask
any
one
if
it
isn
let
s
wish
ourselves
home
said
cyril
in
a
whisper
no
go
robert
whispered
back
she
d
be
there
too
and
raving
mad
as
likely
as
not
horrid
thing
i
hate
her
i
wish
mrs
biddle
was
in
an
angelic
good
temper
cried
anthea
suddenly
it
s
worth
trying
she
said
to
herself
mrs
biddle
s
face
grew
from
purple
to
violet
and
from
violet
to
mauve
and
from
mauve
to
pink
then
she
smiled
quite
a
jolly
smile
why
so
i
am
she
said
what
a
funny
idea
why
shouldn
t
i
be
in
a
good
temper
my
once
more
the
carpet
had
done
its
work
and
not
on
mrs
biddle
alone
the
children
felt
suddenly
good
and
happy
you
re
a
jolly
good
sort
said
cyril
i
see
that
now
i
m
sorry
we
vexed
you
at
the
bazaar
not
another
word
said
the
changed
mrs
biddle
of
course
you
shall
have
the
carpet
my
dears
if
you
ve
taken
such
a
fancy
to
it
no
no
i
won
t
have
more
than
the
ten
shillings
i
it
does
seem
hard
to
ask
you
for
it
after
you
bought
it
at
the
bazaar
said
anthea
but
it
really
is
our
nursery
carpet
it
got
to
the
bazaar
by
mistake
with
some
other
did
it
really
now
how
vexing
said
mrs
biddle
kindly
well
my
dears
i
can
very
well
give
the
extra
ten
shillings
so
you
take
your
carpet
and
we
ll
say
no
more
about
it
have
a
piece
of
cake
before
you
go
i
m
so
sorry
i
stepped
on
your
hand
my
boy
is
it
all
right
now
yes
thank
you
said
robert
i
say
you
are
not
at
all
said
mrs
biddle
heartily
i
m
delighted
to
be
able
to
give
any
little
pleasure
to
you
dear
and
she
helped
them
to
roll
up
the
carpet
and
the
boys
carried
it
away
between
them
you
are
a
dear
said
anthea
and
she
and
mrs
biddle
kissed
each
other
heartily
well
said
cyril
as
they
went
along
the
street
yes
said
robert
and
the
odd
part
is
that
you
feel
just
as
if
it
was
real
her
being
so
jolly
i
mean
and
not
only
the
carpet
making
her
perhaps
it
is
real
said
anthea
only
it
was
covered
up
with
crossness
and
tiredness
and
things
and
the
carpet
took
them
i
hope
it
ll
keep
them
away
said
jane
she
isn
t
ugly
at
all
when
she
the
carpet
has
done
many
wonders
in
its
day
but
the
case
of
mrs
biddle
is
i
think
the
most
wonderful
for
from
that
day
she
was
never
anything
like
so
disagreeable
as
she
was
before
and
she
sent
a
lovely
silver
and
a
kind
letter
to
miss
peasmarsh
when
the
pretty
lady
married
the
nice
curate
just
after
easter
it
was
and
they
went
to
italy
for
their
honeymoon
chapter
the
temple
i
wish
we
could
find
the
phoenix
said
jane
it
s
much
better
company
than
the
beastly
ungrateful
little
kids
are
said
cyril
no
i
m
not
only
the
carpet
never
says
anything
and
it
s
so
helpless
it
doesn
t
seem
able
to
take
care
of
itself
it
gets
sold
and
taken
into
the
sea
and
things
like
that
you
wouldn
t
catch
the
phoenix
getting
it
was
two
days
after
the
bazaar
every
one
was
a
little
cross
some
days
are
like
that
usually
mondays
by
the
way
and
this
was
a
monday
i
shouldn
t
wonder
if
your
precious
phoenix
had
gone
off
for
good
said
cyril
and
i
don
t
know
that
i
blame
it
look
at
the
weather
it
s
not
worth
looking
at
said
robert
and
indeed
it
wasn
t
the
phoenix
hasn
t
gone
i
m
sure
it
hasn
t
said
anthea
i
ll
have
another
look
for
anthea
looked
under
tables
and
chairs
and
in
boxes
and
baskets
in
mother
s
and
father
s
portmanteau
but
still
the
phoenix
showed
not
so
much
as
the
tip
of
one
shining
feather
then
suddenly
robert
remembered
how
the
whole
of
the
greek
invocation
song
of
seven
thousand
lines
had
been
condensed
by
him
into
one
english
hexameter
so
he
stood
on
the
carpet
and
chanted
oh
come
along
come
along
you
good
old
beautiful
phoenix
and
almost
at
once
there
was
a
rustle
of
wings
down
the
kitchen
stairs
and
the
phoenix
sailed
in
on
wide
gold
wings
where
on
earth
have
you
been
asked
anthea
i
ve
looked
everywhere
for
not
everywhere
replied
the
bird
because
you
did
not
look
in
the
place
where
i
was
confess
that
that
hallowed
spot
was
overlooked
by
what
hallowed
spot
asked
cyril
a
little
impatiently
for
time
was
hastening
on
and
the
wishing
carpet
still
idle
the
spot
said
the
phoenix
which
i
hallowed
by
my
golden
presence
was
the
the
what
the
bath
the
place
of
i
m
sure
you
weren
t
said
jane
i
looked
there
three
times
and
moved
all
the
i
was
concealed
said
the
phoenix
on
the
summit
of
a
metal
column
enchanted
i
should
judge
for
it
felt
warm
to
my
golden
toes
as
though
the
glorious
sun
of
the
desert
shone
ever
upon
oh
you
mean
the
cylinder
said
cyril
it
has
rather
a
comforting
feel
this
weather
and
now
where
shall
we
go
and
then
of
course
the
usual
discussion
broke
out
as
to
where
they
should
go
and
what
they
should
do
and
naturally
every
one
wanted
to
do
something
that
the
others
did
not
care
about
i
am
the
eldest
cyril
remarked
let
s
go
to
the
north
this
weather
likely
robert
rejoined
let
s
go
to
the
i
think
the
diamond
mines
of
golconda
would
be
nice
said
anthea
don
t
you
agree
jane
no
i
don
t
retorted
jane
i
don
t
agree
with
you
i
don
t
agree
with
the
phoenix
raised
a
warning
claw
if
you
can
not
agree
among
yourselves
i
fear
i
shall
have
to
leave
you
it
said
well
where
shall
we
go
you
decide
said
all
if
i
were
you
said
the
bird
thoughtfully
i
should
give
the
carpet
a
rest
besides
you
ll
lose
the
use
of
your
legs
if
you
go
everywhere
by
carpet
can
t
you
take
me
out
and
explain
your
ugly
city
to
me
we
will
if
it
clears
up
said
robert
without
enthusiasm
just
look
at
the
rain
and
why
should
we
give
the
carpet
a
rest
are
you
greedy
and
grasping
and
heartless
and
selfish
asked
the
bird
sharply
no
said
robert
with
indignation
well
then
said
the
phoenix
and
as
to
the
rain
well
i
am
not
fond
of
rain
myself
if
the
sun
knew
was
here
he
s
very
fond
of
shining
on
me
because
i
look
so
bright
and
golden
he
always
says
i
repay
a
little
attention
haven
t
you
some
form
of
words
suitable
for
use
in
wet
weather
there
s
rain
rain
go
away
said
anthea
but
it

bird

away

another
day
little
baby
wants
to
play
said
anthea
that
s
quite
wrong
and
if
you
say
it
in
that
sort
of
dull
way
i
can
quite
understand
the
rain
not
taking
any
notice
you
should
open
the
window
and
shout
as
loud
as
you
can
rain
rain
go
away
come
again
another
day
now
we
want
the
sun
and
so
pretty
rain
be
kind
and
go
you
should
always
speak
politely
to
people
when
you
want
them
to
do
things
and
especially
when
it
s
going
away
that
you
want
them
to
do
and
you
might
add
shine
great
sun
the
lovely
nix
is
here
and
wants
to
be
shone
on
splendid
sun
by
thee
that
s
poetry
said
cyril
decidedly
it
s
like
it
said
the
more
cautious
robert
i
was
obliged
to
put
in
lovely
said
the
phoenix
modestly
to
make
the
line
long
there
are
plenty
of
nasty
words
just
that
length
said
jane
but
every
one
else
said
hush
and
then
they
opened
the
window
and
shouted
the
seven
lines
as
loud
as
they
could
and
the
phoenix
said
all
the
words
with
them
except
lovely
and
when
they
came
to
that
it
looked
down
and
coughed
bashfully
the
rain
hesitated
a
moment
and
then
went
away
there
s
true
politeness
said
the
phoenix
and
the
next
moment
it
was
perched
on
the
opening
and
shutting
its
radiant
wings
and
flapping
out
its
golden
feathers
in
such
a
flood
of
glorious
sunshine
as
you
sometimes
have
at
sunset
in
autumn
time
people
said
afterwards
that
there
had
not
been
such
sunshine
in
december
for
years
and
years
and
years
and
now
said
the
bird
we
will
go
out
into
the
city
and
you
shall
take
me
to
see
one
of
my
your
temples
i
gather
from
the
carpet
that
i
have
many
temples
in
this
i
don
t
see
how
you
can
find
anything
out
from
it
said
jane
it
never
all
the
same
you
can
pick
up
things
from
a
carpet
said
the
bird
i
ve
seen
you
do
it
and
i
have
picked
up
several
pieces
of
information
in
this
way
that
papyrus
on
which
you
showed
me
my
picture
i
understand
that
it
bears
on
it
the
name
of
the
street
of
your
city
in
which
my
finest
temple
stands
with
my
image
graved
in
stone
and
in
metal
over
against
its
you
mean
the
fire
insurance
office
said
robert
it
s
not
really
a
temple
and
they
don
t
excuse
me
said
the
phoenix
coldly
you
are
wholly
misinformed
it
is
a
temple
and
they
don
t
let
s
waste
the
sunshine
said
anthea
we
might
argue
as
we
go
along
to
save
so
the
phoenix
consented
to
make
itself
a
nest
in
the
breast
of
robert
s
norfolk
jacket
and
they
all
went
out
into
the
splendid
sunshine
the
best
way
to
the
temple
of
the
phoenix
seemed
to
be
to
take
the
tram
and
on
the
top
of
it
the
children
talked
while
the
phoenix
now
and
then
put
out
a
wary
beak
cocked
a
cautious
eye
and
contradicted
what
the
children
were
saying
it
was
a
delicious
ride
and
the
children
felt
how
lucky
they
were
to
have
had
the
money
to
pay
for
it
they
went
with
the
tram
as
far
as
it
went
and
when
it
did
not
go
any
farther
they
stopped
too
and
got
off
the
tram
stops
at
the
end
of
the
gray
s
inn
road
and
it
was
cyril
who
thought
that
one
might
well
find
a
short
cut
to
the
phoenix
office
through
the
little
streets
and
courts
that
lie
tightly
packed
between
fetter
lane
and
ludgate
circus
of
course
he
was
quite
mistaken
as
robert
told
him
at
the
time
and
afterwards
robert
did
not
forbear
to
remind
his
brother
how
he
had
said
so
the
streets
there
were
small
and
stuffy
and
ugly
and
crowded
with
printers
boys
and
binders
girls
coming
out
from
work
and
these
stared
so
hard
at
the
pretty
red
coats
and
caps
of
the
sisters
that
they
wished
they
had
gone
some
other
way
and
the
printers
and
binders
made
very
personal
remarks
advising
jane
to
get
her
hair
cut
and
inquiring
where
anthea
had
bought
that
hat
jane
and
anthea
scorned
to
reply
and
cyril
and
robert
found
that
they
were
hardly
a
match
for
the
rough
crowd
they
could
think
of
nothing
nasty
enough
to
say
they
turned
a
corner
sharply
and
then
anthea
pulled
jane
into
an
archway
and
then
inside
a
door
cyril
and
robert
quickly
followed
and
the
jeering
crowd
passed
by
without
seein
them
anthea
drew
a
long
breath
how
awful
she
said
i
didn
t
know
there
were
such
people
except
in
it
was
a
bit
thick
but
it
s
partly
you
girls
fault
coming
out
in
those
flashy
we
thought
we
ought
to
when
we
were
going
out
with
the
phoenix
said
jane
and
the
bird
said
quite
right
too
and
incautiously
put
out
his
head
to
give
her
a
wink
of
encouragement
and
at
the
same
instant
a
dirty
hand
reached
through
the
grim
balustrade
of
the
staircase
beside
them
and
clutched
the
phoenix
and
a
hoarse
voice
said
i
say
urb
blowed
if
this
ain
t
our
poll
parrot
what
we
lost
thank
you
very
much
lidy
for
bringin
im
home
to
the
four
turned
swiftly
two
large
and
ragged
boys
were
crouched
amid
the
dark
shadows
of
the
stairs
they
were
much
larger
than
robert
and
cyril
and
one
of
them
had
snatched
the
phoenix
away
and
was
holding
it
high
above
their
heads
give
me
that
bird
said
cyril
sternly
it
s
good

and
thankin

the

mockery

robert

he
sprang
up
three
stairs
and
hit
out
there
was
a
squawk
the
most
noise
any
one
had
ever
heard
from
the
phoenix
and
a
fluttering
and
a
laugh
in
the
darkness
and
ike
said
there

robert
stamped
with
fury
cyril
felt
himself
growing
pale
with
rage
and
with
the
effort
of
screwing
up
his
brain
to
make
it
clever
enough
to
think
of
some
way
of
being
even
with
those
boys
anthea
and
jane
were
as
angry
as
the
boys
but
it
made
them
want
to
cry
yet
it
was
anthea
who
said
do

suddenly

the

isaac

repeated
the
phoenix
sternly
who
pinched
the
click
off
of
the
old
bloke
in
aldermanbury
it
added
in
a
changed
tone
who
sneaked
the
out
of
the
young
gell

and
in
bell
court
who
stow
it
said
ike

my
there
were
howls
a
scuffle
a
flutter
ike
and
urb
fled
up
the
stairs
and
the
phoenix
swept
out
through
the
doorway
the
children
followed
and
the
phoenix
settled
on
robert
like
a
butterfly
on
a
rose
as
anthea
said
afterwards
and
wriggled
into
the
breast
of
his
norfolk
jacket
like
an
eel
into
mud
as
cyril
later
said
why
ever
didn
t
you
burn
him
you
could
have
couldn
t
you
asked
robert
when
the
hurried
flight
through
the
narrow
courts
had
ended
in
the
safe
wideness
of
farringdon
street
i
could
have
of
course
said
the
bird
but
i
didn
t
think
it
would
be
dignified
to
allow
myself
to
get
warm
about
a
little
thing
like
that
the
fates
after
all
have
not
been
illiberal
to
me
i
have
a
good
many
friends
among
the
london
sparrows
and
i
have
a
beak
and
these
happenings
had
somewhat
shaken
the
adventurous
temper
of
the
children
and
the
phoenix
had
to
exert
its
golden
self
to
hearten
them
up
presently
the
children
came
to
a
great
house
in
lombard
street
and
there
on
each
side
of
the
door
was
the
image
of
the
phoenix
carved
in
stone
and
set
forth
on
shining
brass
were
the
words
phoenix
fire
office
one
moment
said
the
bird
fire
for
altars
i
suppose
don
t
know
said
robert
he
was
beginning
to
feel
shy
and
that
always
made
him
rather
cross
oh
yes
you
do
cyril
contradicted
when
people
s
houses
are
burnt
down
the
phoenix
gives
them
new
houses
father
told
me
i
asked
the
house
then
like
the
phoenix
rises
from
its
ashes
well
have
my
priests
dealt
with
the
sons
of
men
the
sons
of
men
pay
you
know
said
anthea
but
it
s
only
a
little
every
that
is
to
maintain
my
priests
said
the
bird
who
in
the
hour
of
affliction
heal
sorrows
and
rebuild
houses
lead
on
inquire
for
the
high
priest
i
will
not
break
upon
them
too
suddenly
in
all
my
glory
noble
and
are
they
who
make
as
nought
the
evil
deeds
of
the
and
unpleasing
i
don
t
know
what
you
re
talking
about
and
i
wish
you
wouldn
t
muddle
us
with
new
names
fire
just
happens
nobody
does
it
not
as
a
deed
you
know
cyril
explained
if
they
did
the
phoenix
wouldn
t
help
them
because
its
a
crime
to
set
fire
to
things
arsenic
or
something
they
call
it
because
it
s
as
bad
as
poisoning
people
the
phoenix
wouldn
t
help
them
father
told
me
it
wouldn
my
priests
do
well
said
the
phoenix
lead
i
don
t
know
what
to
say
said
cyril
and
the
others
said
the
same
ask
for
the
high
priest
said
the
phoenix
say
that
you
have
a
secret
to
unfold
that
concerns
my
worship
and
he
will
lead
you
to
the
innermost
so
the
children
went
in
all
four
of
them
though
they
didn
t
like
it
and
stood
in
a
large
and
beautiful
hall
adorned
with
doulton
tiles
like
a
large
and
beautiful
bath
with
no
water
in
it
and
stately
pillars
supporting
the
roof
an
unpleasing
representation
of
the
phoenix
in
brown
pottery
disfigured
one
wall
there
were
counters
and
desks
of
mahogany
and
brass
and
clerks
bent
over
the
desks
and
walked
behind
the
counters
there
was
a
great
clock
over
an
inner
doorway
inquire
for
the
high
priest
whispered
the
phoenix
an
attentive
clerk
in
decent
black
who
controlled
his
mouth
but
not
his
eyebrows
now
came
towards
them
he
leaned
forward
on
the
counter
and
the
children
thought
he
was
going
to
say
what
can
i
have
the
pleasure
of
showing
you
like
in
a
draper
s
instead
of
which
the
young
man
said
and
what
do
you
want
we
want
to
see
the
high
get
along
with
you
said
the
young
man
an
elder
man
also
decent
in
black
coat
advanced
perhaps
it
s
mr
blank
not
for
worlds
would
i
give
the
name
he
s
a
masonic
high
priest
you
a
porter
was
sent
away
to
look
for
mr
asterisk
i
can
not
give
his
name
and
the
children
were
left
there
to
look
on
and
be
looked
on
by
all
the
gentlemen
at
the
mahogany
desks
anthea
and
jane
thought
that
they
looked
kind
the
boys
thought
they
stared
and
that
it
was
like
their
cheek
the
porter
returned
with
the
news
that
mr
dot
dash
dot
i
dare
not
reveal
his
name
was
out
but
that
mr
here
a
really
delightful
gentleman
appeared
he
had
a
beard
and
a
kind
and
merry
eye
and
each
one
of
the
four
knew
at
once
that
this
was
a
man
who
had
kiddies
of
his
own
and
could
understand
what
you
were
talking
about
yet
it
was
a
difficult
thing
to
explain
what
is
it
he
asked
mr
he
named
the
name
which
i
will
never
reveal
is
out
can
i
do
anything
inner
sanctuary
murmured
the
phoenix
i
beg
your
pardon
said
the
nice
gentleman
who
thought
it
was
robert
who
had
spoken
we
have
something
to
tell
you
said
cyril
but
he
glanced
at
the
porter
who
was
lingering
much
nearer
than
he
need
have
done
this
is
a
very
public
the
nice
gentleman
laughed
come
upstairs
then
he
said
and
led
the
way
up
a
wide
and
beautiful
staircase
anthea
says
the
stairs
were
of
white
marble
but
i
am
not
sure
on
the
of
the
stairs
at
the
top
was
a
beautiful
image
of
the
phoenix
in
dark
metal
and
on
the
wall
at
each
side
was
a
flat
sort
of
image
of
it
the
nice
gentleman
led
them
into
a
room
where
the
chairs
and
even
the
tables
were
covered
with
reddish
leather
he
looked
at
the
children
inquiringly
don
t
be
frightened
he
said
tell
me
exactly
what
you
may
i
shut
the
door
asked
cyril
the
gentleman
looked
surprised
but
he
shut
the
door
now
said
cyril
firmly
i
know
you
ll
be
awfully
surprised
and
you
ll
think
it
s
not
true
and
we
are
lunatics
but
we
aren
t
and
it
is
robert
s
got
something
inside
his
norfolk
that
s
robert
he
s
my
young
brother
now
don
t
be
upset
and
have
a
fit
or
anything
sir
of
course
i
know
when
you
called
your
shop
the
phoenix
you
never
thought
there
was
one
but
there
is
and
robert
s
got
it
buttoned
up
against
his
chest
if
it
s
an
old
curio
in
the
form
of
a
phoenix
i
dare
say
the
board
said
the
nice
gentleman
as
robert
began
to
fumble
with
his
buttons
it
s
old
enough
said
anthea
going
by
what
it
says
but
my
goodness
gracious
said
the
gentleman
as
the
phoenix
with
one
last
wriggle
that
melted
into
a
flutter
got
out
of
its
nest
in
the
breast
of
robert
and
stood
up
on
the
table
what
an
extraordinarily
fine
bird
he
went
on
i
don
t
think
i
ever
saw
one
just
like
i
should
think
not
said
the
phoenix
with
pardonable
pride
and
the
gentleman
jumped
oh
it
s
been
taught
to
speak
some
sort
of
parrot
perhaps
i
am
said
the
bird
simply
the
head
of
your
house
and
i
have
come
to
my
temple
to
receive
your
homage
i
am
no
parrot
its
beak
curved
scornfully
i
am
the
one
and
only
phoenix
and
i
demand
the
homage
of
my
high
in
the
absence
of
our
manager
the
gentleman
began
exactly
as
though
he
were
addressing
a
valued
customer
in
the
absence
of
our
manager
i
might
perhaps
be
able
what
am
i
saying
he
turned
pale
and
passed
his
hand
across
his
brow
my
dears
he
said
the
weather
is
unusually
warm
for
the
time
of
year
and
i
don
t
feel
quite
myself
do
you
know
for
a
moment
i
really
thought
that
that
remarkable
bird
of
yours
had
spoken
and
said
it
was
the
phoenix
and
what
s
more
that
i
d
believed
so
it
did
sir
said
cyril
and
so
did
it
really
allow
a
bell
was
rung
the
porter
appeared
mackenzie
said
the
gentleman
you
see
that
golden
bird
yes
the
other
breathed
a
sigh
of
relief
it
is
real
then
yes
sir
of
course
sir
you
take
it
in
your
hand
sir
said
the
porter
sympathetically
and
reached
out
his
hand
to
the
phoenix
who
shrank
back
on
toes
curved
with
agitated
indignation
forbear
it
cried
how
dare
you
seek
to
lay
hands
on
me
the
porter
saluted
beg
pardon
sir
he
said
i
thought
you
was
a
i
am
a
bird
the
bird
the
of
course
you
are
sir
said
the
porter
i
see
that
the
first
minute
directly
i
got
my
breath
that
will
do
said
the
gentleman
ask
mr
wilson
and
mr
sterry
to
step
up
here
for
a
moment
mr
sterry
and
mr
wilson
were
in
their
turn
overcome
by
amazement
quickly
followed
by
conviction
to
the
surprise
of
the
children
every
one
in
the
office
took
the
phoenix
at
its
word
and
after
the
first
shock
of
surprise
it
seemed
to
be
perfectly
natural
to
every
one
that
the
phoenix
should
be
alive
and
that
passing
through
london
it
should
call
at
its
temple
we
ought
to
have
some
sort
of
ceremony
said
the
nicest
gentleman
anxiously
there
isn
t
time
to
summon
the
directors
and
shareholders
we
might
do
that
tomorrow
perhaps
yes
the
would
be
best
i
shouldn
t
like
it
to
feel
we
hadn
t
done
everything
in
our
power
to
show
our
appreciation
of
its
condescension
in
looking
in
on
us
in
this
friendly
the
children
could
hardly
believe
their
ears
for
they
had
never
thought
that
any
one
but
themselves
would
believe
in
the
phoenix
and
yet
every
one
did
all
the
men
in
the
office
were
brought
in
by
twos
and
threes
and
the
moment
the
phoenix
opened
its
beak
it
convinced
the
cleverest
of
them
as
well
as
those
who
were
not
so
clever
cyril
wondered
how
the
story
would
look
in
the
papers
next
day
he
seemed
to
see
the
posters
in
the
streets
phoenix
fire
office
the
phoenix
at
its
temple
meeting
to
welcome
it
delight
of
the
manager
and
everybody
excuse
our
leaving
you
a
moment
said
the
nice
gentleman
and
he
went
away
with
the
others
and
through
the
door
the
children
could
hear
the
sound
of
many
boots
on
stairs
the
hum
of
excited
voices
explaining
suggesting
arguing
the
thumpy
drag
of
heavy
furniture
being
moved
about
the
phoenix
strutted
up
and
down
the
table
looking
over
its
shoulder
at
its
pretty
back
you
see
what
a
convincing
manner
i
have
it
said
proudly
and
now
a
new
gentleman
came
in
and
said
bowing
low
everything
is
prepared
we
have
done
our
best
at
so
short
a
notice
the
meeting
the
ceremony
will
be
in
the
will
the
honourable
phoenix
walk
it
is
only
a
few
steps
or
would
it
like
to
be
would
it
like
some
sort
of
conveyance
my
robert
will
bear
me
to
the
if
that
be
the
unlovely
name
of
my
temple
s
inmost
court
replied
the
bird
so
they
all
followed
the
gentleman
there
was
a
big
table
in
the
but
it
had
been
pushed
right
up
under
the
long
windows
at
one
side
and
chairs
were
arranged
in
rows
across
the
room
like
those
you
have
at
schools
when
there
is
a
magic
lantern
on
our
eastern
empire
or
on
the
way
we
do
in
the
navy
the
doors
were
of
carved
wood
very
beautiful
with
a
carved
phoenix
above
anthea
noticed
that
the
chairs
in
the
front
rows
were
of
the
kind
that
her
mother
so
loved
to
ask
the
price
of
in
old
furniture
shops
and
never
could
buy
because
the
price
was
always
nearly
twenty
pounds
each
on
the
mantelpiece
were
some
heavy
bronze
candlesticks
and
a
clock
and
on
the
top
of
the
clock
was
another
image
of
the
phoenix
remove
that
effigy
said
the
phoenix
to
the
gentlemen
who
were
there
and
it
was
hastily
taken
down
then
the
phoenix
fluttered
to
the
middle
of
the
mantelpiece
and
stood
there
looking
more
golden
than
ever
then
every
one
in
the
house
and
the
office
came
in
from
the
cashier
to
the
women
who
cooked
the
clerks
dinners
in
the
beautiful
kitchen
at
the
top
of
the
house
and
every
one
bowed
to
the
phoenix
and
then
sat
down
in
a
chair
gentlemen
said
the
nicest
gentleman
we
have
met
here
today
the
phoenix
was
turning
its
golden
beak
from
side
to
side
i
don
t
notice
any
incense
it
said
with
an
injured
sniff
a
hurried
consultation
ended
in
plates
being
fetched
from
the
kitchen
brown
sugar
and
tobacco
were
placed
on
these
and
something
from
a
square
bottle
was
poured
over
it
all
then
a
match
was
applied
it
was
the
only
incense
that
was
handy
in
the
phoenix
office
and
it
certainly
burned
very
briskly
and
smoked
a
great
deal
we
have
met
here
today
said
the
gentleman
again
on
an
occasion
unparalleled
in
the
annals
of
this
office
our
respected
phoenix
head
of
the
house
said
the
phoenix
in
a
hollow
voice
i
was
coming
to
that
our
respected
phoenix
the
head
of
this
ancient
house
has
at
length
done
us
the
honour
to
come
among
us
i
think
i
may
say
gentlemen
that
we
are
not
insensible
to
this
honour
and
that
we
welcome
with
no
uncertain
voice
one
whom
we
have
so
long
desired
to
see
in
our
several
of
the
younger
clerks
thought
of
saying
hear
hear
but
they
feared
it
might
seem
disrespectful
to
the
bird
i
will
not
take
up
your
time
the
speaker
went
on
by
recapitulating
the
advantages
to
be
derived
from
a
proper
use
of
our
system
of
fire
insurance
i
know
and
you
know
gentlemen
that
our
aim
has
ever
been
to
be
worthy
of
that
eminent
bird
whose
name
we
bear
and
who
now
adorns
our
mantelpiece
with
his
presence
three
cheers
gentlemen
for
the
winged
head
of
the
house
the
cheers
rose
deafening
when
they
had
died
away
the
phoenix
was
asked
to
say
a
few
words
it
expressed
in
graceful
phrases
the
pleasure
it
felt
in
finding
itself
at
last
in
its
own
temple
and
it
went
on
you
must
not
think
me
wanting
in
appreciation
of
your
very
hearty
and
cordial
reception
when
i
ask
that
an
ode
may
be
recited
or
a
choric
song
sung
it
is
what
i
have
always
been
accustomed
the
four
children
dumb
witnesses
of
this
wonderful
scene
glanced
a
little
nervously
across
the
foam
of
white
faces
above
the
sea
of
black
coats
it
seemed
to
them
that
the
phoenix
was
really
asking
a
little
too
much
time
presses
said
the
phoenix
and
the
original
ode
of
invocation
is
long
as
well
as
being
greek
and
besides
it
s
no
use
invoking
me
when
here
i
am
but
is
there
not
a
song
in
your
own
tongue
for
a
great
day
such
as
this
absently
the
manager
began
to
sing
and
one
by
one
the
rest
joined
absolute
security
no
liability
all
kinds
of
property
insured
against
fire
terms
most
favourable
expenses
reasonable
moderate
rates
for
annual
that
one
is
not
my
favourite
interrupted
the
phoenix
and
i
think
you
ve
forgotten
part
of
the
manager
hastily
began
another
o
golden
phoenix
fairest
bird
the
whole
great
world
has
often
heard
of
all
the
splendid
things
we
do
great
phoenix
just
to
honour
that
s
better
said
the
bird
and
every
one
sang
class
one
for
private
for
household
goods
and
shops
allows
provided
these
are
built
of
brick
or
stone
and
tiled
and
slated
try
another
verse
said
the
phoenix
further
and
again
arose
the
voices
of
all
the
clerks
and
employees
and
managers
and
secretaries
and
cooks
in
scotland
our
insurance
yields
the
price
of
stacks
in
skip
that
verse
said
the
phoenix
thatched
dwellings
and
their
whole
contents
we
deal
with
also
with
their
rents
oh
glorious
phoenix
look
and
see
that
these
are
dealt
with
in
class
three
the
glories
of
your
temple
throng
too
thick
to
go
in
any
song
and
we
attend
o
good
and
wise
to
days
of
grace
and
merchandise
when
people
s
homes
are
burned
away
they
never
have
a
cent
to
pay
if
they
have
done
as
all
should
do
o
phoenix
and
have
honoured
you
so
let
us
raise
our
voice
and
sing
the
praises
of
the
phoenix
king
in
classes
one
and
two
and
three
oh
trust
to
him
for
kind
is
he
i
m
sure
you
re
very
kind
said
the
phoenix
and
now
we
must
be
going
an
thank
you
very
much
for
a
very
pleasant
time
may
you
all
prosper
as
you
deserve
to
do
for
i
am
sure
a
nicer
lot
of
temple
attendants
i
have
never
met
and
never
wish
to
meet
i
wish
you
all
it
fluttered
to
the
wrist
of
robert
and
drew
the
four
children
from
the
room
the
whole
of
the
office
staff
followed
down
the
wide
stairs
and
filed
into
their
accustomed
places
and
the
two
most
important
officials
stood
on
the
steps
bowing
till
robert
had
buttoned
the
golden
bird
in
his
norfolk
bosom
and
it
and
he
and
the
three
other
children
were
lost
in
the
crowd
the
two
most
important
gentlemen
looked
at
each
other
earnestly
and
strangely
for
a
moment
and
then
retreated
to
those
sacred
inner
rooms
where
they
toil
without
ceasing
for
the
good
of
the
house
and
the
moment
they
were
all
in
their
places
managers
secretaries
clerks
and
porters
they
all
started
and
each
looked
cautiously
round
to
see
if
any
one
was
looking
at
him
for
each
thought
that
he
had
fallen
asleep
for
a
few
minutes
and
had
dreamed
a
very
odd
dream
about
the
phoenix
and
the
and
of
course
no
one
mentioned
it
to
any
one
else
because
going
to
sleep
at
your
office
is
a
thing
you
simply
must
not
do
the
extraordinary
confusion
of
the
with
the
remains
of
the
incense
in
the
plates
would
have
shown
them
at
once
that
the
visit
of
the
phoenix
had
been
no
dream
but
a
radiant
reality
but
no
one
went
into
the
again
that
day
and
next
day
before
the
office
was
opened
it
was
all
cleaned
and
put
nice
and
tidy
by
a
lady
whose
business
asking
questions
was
not
part
of
that
is
why
cyril
read
the
papers
in
vain
on
the
next
day
and
the
day
after
that
because
no
sensible
person
thinks
his
dreams
worth
putting
in
the
paper
and
no
one
will
ever
own
that
he
has
been
asleep
in
the
daytime
the
phoenix
was
very
pleased
but
it
decided
to
write
an
ode
for
itself
it
thought
the
ones
it
had
heard
at
its
temple
had
been
too
hastily
composed
its
own
ode
began
for
beauty
and
for
modest
worth
the
phoenix
has
not
its
equal
on
and
when
the
children
went
to
bed
that
night
it
was
still
trying
to
cut
down
the
last
line
to
the
proper
length
without
taking
out
any
of
what
it
wanted
to
say
that
is
what
makes
poetry
so
difficult
chapter
doing
good
we
shan
t
be
able
to
go
anywhere
on
the
carpet
for
a
whole
week
though
said
robert
and
i
m
glad
of
it
said
jane
unexpectedly
glad
said
cyril
glad
it
was
and
mother
s
letter
telling
them
how
they
were
all
going
for
christmas
to
their
aunt
s
at
lyndhurst
and
how
father
and
mother
would
meet
them
there
having
been
read
by
every
one
lay
on
the
table
drinking
hot
with
one
corner
and
eating
marmalade
with
the
other
yes
glad
said
jane
i
don
t
want
any
more
things
to
happen
just
now
i
feel
like
you
do
when
you
ve
been
to
three
parties
in
a
week
like
we
did
at
granny
s
once
and
extras
in
between
toys
and
chocs
and
things
like
that
i
want
everything
to
be
just
real
and
no
fancy
things
happening
at
i
don
t
like
being
obliged
to
keep
things
from
mother
said
anthea
i
don
t
know
why
but
it
makes
me
feel
selfish
and
if
we
could
only
get
the
mater
to
believe
it
we
might
take
her
to
the
jolliest
places
said
cyril
thoughtfully
as
it
is
we
ve
just
got
to
be
selfish
and
mean
if
it
is
that
but
i
don
t
feel
it
i
know
it
isn
t
but
i
feel
it
is
said
anthea
and
that
s
just
as
it
s
worse
said
robert
if
you
knew
it
and
didn
t
feel
it
it
wouldn
t
matter
so
that
s
being
a
hardened
criminal
father
says
put
in
cyril
and
he
picked
up
mother
s
letter
and
wiped
its
corners
with
his
handkerchief
to
whose
colour
a
trifle
of
and
marmalade
made
but
little
difference
we
re
going
anyhow
said
robert
don
t
he
added
with
a
expression
on
his
face
don
t
let
s
be
ungrateful
for
our
blessings
don
t
let
s
waste
the
day
in
saying
how
horrid
it
is
to
keep
secrets
from
mother
when
we
all
know
anthea
tried
all
she
knew
to
give
her
the
secret
and
she
wouldn
t
take
it
let
s
get
on
the
carpet
and
have
a
jolly
good
wish
you
ll
have
time
enough
to
repent
of
things
all
next
yes
said
cyril
let
s
it
s
not
really
well
look
here
said
anthea
you
know
there
s
something
about
christmas
that
makes
you
want
to
be
good
however
little
you
wish
it
at
other
times
couldn
t
we
wish
the
carpet
to
take
us
somewhere
where
we
should
have
the
chance
to
do
some
good
and
kind
action
it
would
be
an
adventure
just
the
same
she
pleaded
i
don
t
mind
said
cyril
we
shan
t
know
where
we
re
going
and
that
ll
be
exciting
no
one
knows
what
ll
happen
we
d
best
put
on
our
outers
in
case
we
might
rescue
a
traveller
buried
in
the
snow
like
st
bernard
dogs
with
barrels
round
our
necks
said
jane
beginning
to
be
interested
or
we
might
arrive
just
in
time
to
witness
a
will
being
signed
more
tea
please
said
robert
and
we
should
see
the
old
man
hide
it
away
in
the
secret
cupboard
and
then
after
long
years
when
the
rightful
heir
was
in
despair
we
should
lead
him
to
the
hidden
panel
and
yes
interrupted
anthea
or
we
might
be
taken
to
some
freezing
garret
in
a
german
town
where
a
poor
little
pale
sick
child
we
haven
t
any
german
money
interrupted
cyril
so
that
s
no
go
what
i
should
like
would
be
getting
into
the
middle
of
a
war
and
getting
hold
of
secret
intelligence
and
taking
it
to
the
general
and
he
would
make
me
a
lieutenant
or
a
scout
or
a
when
breakfast
was
cleared
away
anthea
swept
the
carpet
and
the
children
sat
down
on
it
together
with
the
phoenix
who
had
been
especially
invited
as
a
christmas
treat
to
come
with
them
and
witness
the
good
and
kind
action
they
were
about
to
do
four
children
and
one
bird
were
ready
and
the
wish
was
wished
every
one
closed
its
eyes
so
as
to
feel
the
swirl
of
the
carpet
s
movement
as
little
as
possible
when
the
eyes
were
opened
again
the
children
found
themselves
on
the
carpet
and
the
carpet
was
in
its
proper
place
on
the
floor
of
their
own
nursery
at
camden
town
i
say
said
cyril
here
s
a
go
do
you
think
it
s
worn
out
the
wishing
part
of
it
i
mean
robert
anxiously
asked
the
phoenix
it
s
not
that
said
the
phoenix
but
well
what
did
you
wish
oh
i
see
what
it
means
said
robert
with
deep
disgust
it
s
like
the
end
of
a
fairy
story
in
a
sunday
magazine
how
perfectly
beastly
you
mean
it
means
we
can
do
kind
and
good
actions
where
we
are
i
see
i
suppose
it
wants
us
to
carry
coals
for
the
cook
or
make
clothes
for
the
bare
heathens
well
i
simply
won
t
and
the
last
day
and
everything
look
here
cyril
spoke
loudly
and
firmly
we
want
to
go
somewhere
really
interesting
where
we
have
a
chance
of
doing
something
good
and
kind
we
don
t
want
to
do
it
here
but
somewhere
else
see
now
the
obedient
carpet
started
instantly
and
the
four
children
and
one
bird
fell
in
a
heap
together
and
as
they
fell
were
plunged
in
perfect
darkness
are
you
all
there
said
anthea
breathlessly
through
the
black
dark
every
one
owned
that
it
was
there
where
are
we
oh
how
shivery
and
wet
it
is
ugh
oh
i
ve
put
my
hand
in
a
puddle
has
any
one
got
any
matches
said
anthea
hopelessly
she
felt
sure
that
no
one
would
have
any
it
was
then
that
robert
with
a
radiant
smile
of
triumph
that
was
quite
wasted
in
the
darkness
where
of
course
no
one
could
see
anything
drew
out
of
his
pocket
a
box
of
matches
struck
a
match
and
lighted
a
candle
two
candles
and
every
one
with
its
mouth
open
blinked
at
the
sudden
light
well
done
bobs
said
his
sisters
and
even
cyril
s
natural
brotherly
feelings
could
not
check
his
admiration
of
robert
s
foresight
i
ve
always
carried
them
about
ever
since
the
lone
tower
day
said
robert
with
modest
pride
i
knew
we
should
want
them
some
day
i
kept
the
secret
well
didn
t
i
oh
yes
said
cyril
with
fine
scorn
i
found
them
the
sunday
after
when
i
was
feeling
in
your
norfolks
for
the
knife
you
borrowed
off
me
but
i
thought
you
d
only
sneaked
them
for
chinese
lanterns
or
reading
in
bed
bobs
said
anthea
suddenly
do
you
know
where
we
are
this
is
the
underground
passage
and
look
there
there
s
the
money
and
the
and
by
this
time
the
ten
eyes
had
got
used
to
the
light
of
the
candles
and
no
one
could
help
seeing
that
anthea
spoke
the
truth
it
seems
an
odd
place
to
do
good
and
kind
acts
in
though
said
jane
there
s
no
one
to
do
them
don
t
you
be
too
sure
said
cyril
just
round
the
next
turning
we
might
find
a
prisoner
who
has
languished
here
for
years
and
years
and
we
could
take
him
out
on
our
carpet
and
restore
him
to
his
sorrowing
of
course
we
could
said
robert
standing
up
and
holding
the
candle
above
his
head
to
see
further
off
or
we
might
find
the
bones
of
a
poor
prisoner
and
take
them
to
his
friends
to
be
buried
properly
that
s
always
a
kind
action
in
books
though
i
never
could
see
what
bones
i
wish
you
wouldn
t
said
jane
i
know
exactly
where
we
shall
find
the
bones
too
robert
went
on
you
see
that
dark
arch
just
along
the
passage
well
just
inside
there
if
you
don
t
stop
going
on
like
that
said
jane
firmly
i
shall
scream
and
then
i
ll
faint
so
now
then
and
will
too
said
anthea
robert
was
not
pleased
at
being
checked
in
his
flight
of
fancy
you
girls
will
never
be
great
writers
he
said
bitterly
they
just
love
to
think
of
things
in
dungeons
and
chains
and
knobbly
bare
human
bones
and
jane
had
opened
her
mouth
to
scream
but
before
she
could
decide
how
you
began
when
you
wanted
to
faint
the
golden
voice
of
the
phoenix
spoke
through
the
gloom
peace
it
said
there
are
no
bones
here
except
the
small
but
useful
sets
that
you
have
inside
you
and
you
did
not
invite
me
to
come
out
with
you
to
hear
you
talk
about
bones
but
to
see
you
do
some
good
and
kind
we
can
t
do
it
here
said
robert
sulkily
no
rejoined
the
bird
the
only
thing
we
can
do
here
it
seems
is
to
try
to
frighten
our
little
he
didn
t
really
and
i
m
not
so
very
little
said
jane
rather
ungratefully
robert
was
silent
it
was
cyril
who
suggested
that
perhaps
they
had
better
take
the
money
and
go
that
wouldn
t
be
a
kind
act
except
to
ourselves
and
it
wouldn
t
be
good
whatever
way
you
look
at
it
said
anthea
to
take
money
that
s
not
we
might
take
it
and
spend
it
all
on
benefits
to
the
poor
and
aged
said
cyril
that
wouldn
t
make
it
right
to
steal
said
anthea
stoutly
i
don
t
know
said
cyril
they
were
all
standing
up
now
stealing
is
taking
things
that
belong
to
some
one
else
and
there
s
no
one
it
can
t
be
stealing
if
that
s
right
said
robert
with
ironical
approval
stand
here
all
day
arguing
while
the
candles
burn
out
you
ll
like
it
awfully
when
it
s
all
dark
again
and
let
s
get
out
then
said
anthea
we
can
argue
as
we
so
they
rolled
up
the
carpet
and
went
but
when
they
had
crept
along
to
the
place
where
the
passage
led
into
the
topless
tower
they
found
the
way
blocked
by
a
great
stone
which
they
could
not
move
there
said
robert
i
hope
you
re
satisfied
everything
has
two
ends
said
the
phoenix
softly
even
a
quarrel
or
a
secret
so
they
turned
round
and
went
back
and
robert
was
made
to
go
first
with
one
of
the
candles
because
he
was
the
one
who
had
begun
to
talk
about
bones
and
cyril
carried
the
carpet
i
wish
you
hadn
t
put
bones
into
our
heads
said
jane
as
they
went
along
i
didn
t
you
always
had
them
more
bones
than
brains
said
robert
the
passage
was
long
and
there
were
arches
and
steps
and
turnings
and
dark
alcoves
that
the
girls
did
not
much
like
passing
the
passage
ended
in
a
flight
of
steps
robert
went
up
them
suddenly
he
staggered
heavily
back
on
to
the
following
feet
of
jane
and
everybody
screamed
oh
what
is
it
i
ve
only
bashed
my
head
in
said
robert
when
he
had
groaned
for
some
time
that
s
all
don
t
mention
it
i
like
it
the
stairs
just
go
right
slap
into
the
ceiling
and
it
s
a
stone
ceiling
you
can
t
do
good
and
kind
actions
underneath
a
stairs
aren
t
made
to
lead
just
to
as
a
general
rule
said
the
phoenix
put
your
shoulder
to
the
there
isn
t
any
wheel
said
the
injured
robert
still
rubbing
his
head
but
cyril
had
pushed
past
him
to
the
top
stair
and
was
already
shoving
his
hardest
against
the
stone
above
of
course
it
did
not
give
in
the
least
if
it
s
a
said
cyril
and
he
stopped
shoving
and
began
to
feel
about
with
his
hands
yes
there
is
a
bolt
i
can
t
move
by
a
happy
chance
cyril
had
in
his
pocket
the
of
his
father
s
bicycle
he
put
the
carpet
down
at
the
foot
of
the
stairs
and
he
lay
on
his
back
with
his
head
on
the
top
step
and
his
feet
straggling
down
among
his
young
relations
and
he
oiled
the
bolt
till
the
drops
of
rust
and
oil
fell
down
on
his
face
one
even
went
into
his
mouth
open
as
he
panted
with
the
exertion
of
keeping
up
this
unnatural
position
then
he
tried
again
but
still
the
bolt
would
not
move
so
now
he
tied
his
handkerchief
the
one
with
the
and
marmalade
on
it
to
the
bolt
and
robert
s
handkerchief
to
that
in
a
reef
knot
which
can
not
come
undone
however
much
you
pull
and
indeed
gets
tighter
and
tighter
the
more
you
pull
it
this
must
not
be
confused
with
a
granny
knot
which
comes
undone
if
you
look
at
it
and
then
he
and
robert
pulled
and
the
girls
put
their
arms
round
their
brothers
and
pulled
too
and
suddenly
the
bolt
gave
way
with
a
rusty
scrunch
and
they
all
rolled
together
to
the
bottom
of
the
stairs
all
but
the
phoenix
which
had
taken
to
its
wings
when
the
pulling
began
nobody
was
hurt
much
because
the
carpet
broke
their
fall
and
now
indeed
the
shoulders
of
the
boys
were
used
to
some
purpose
for
the
stone
allowed
them
to
heave
it
up
they
felt
it
give
dust
fell
freely
on
them
now
then
cried
robert
forgetting
his
head
and
his
temper
push
all
together
one
two
three
the
stone
was
heaved
up
it
swung
up
on
a
creaking
unwilling
hinge
and
showed
a
growing
oblong
of
dazzling
daylight
and
it
fell
back
with
a
bang
against
something
that
kept
it
upright
every
one
climbed
out
but
there
was
not
room
for
every
one
to
stand
comfortably
in
the
little
paved
house
where
they
found
themselves
so
when
the
phoenix
had
fluttered
up
from
the
darkness
they
let
the
stone
down
and
it
closed
like
a
as
indeed
it
was
you
can
have
no
idea
how
dusty
and
dirty
the
children
were
fortunately
there
was
no
one
to
see
them
but
each
other
the
place
they
were
in
was
a
little
shrine
built
on
the
side
of
a
road
that
went
winding
up
through
fields
to
the
topless
tower
below
them
were
fields
and
orchards
all
bare
boughs
and
brown
furrows
and
little
houses
and
gardens
the
shrine
was
a
kind
of
tiny
chapel
with
no
front
wall
just
a
place
for
people
to
stop
and
rest
in
and
wish
to
be
good
so
the
phoenix
told
them
there
was
an
image
that
had
once
been
brightly
coloured
but
the
rain
and
snow
had
beaten
in
through
the
open
front
of
the
shrine
and
the
poor
image
was
dull
and
under
it
was
written
st
jean
de
luz
priez
pour
it
was
a
sad
little
place
very
neglected
and
lonely
and
yet
it
was
nice
anthea
thought
that
poor
travellers
should
come
to
this
little
in
the
hurry
and
worry
of
their
journeyings
and
be
quiet
for
a
few
minutes
and
think
about
being
good
the
thought
of
st
jean
de
luz
who
had
no
doubt
in
his
time
been
very
good
and
kind
made
anthea
want
more
than
ever
to
do
something
kind
and
good
tell
us
she
said
to
the
phoenix
what
is
the
good
and
kind
action
the
carpet
brought
us
here
to
do
i
think
it
would
be
kind
to
find
the
owners
of
the
treasure
and
tell
them
about
it
said
cyril
and
give
it
them
all
said
jane
yes
but
whose
is
it
i
should
go
to
the
first
house
and
ask
the
name
of
the
owner
of
the
castle
said
the
golden
bird
and
really
the
idea
seemed
a
good
one
they
dusted
each
other
as
well
as
they
could
and
went
down
the
road
a
little
way
on
they
found
a
tiny
spring
bubbling
out
of
the
hillside
and
falling
into
a
rough
stone
basin
surrounded
by
draggled
hart
ferns
now
hardly
green
at
all
here
the
children
washed
their
hands
and
faces
and
dried
them
on
their
which
always
on
these
occasions
seem
unnaturally
small
cyril
s
and
robert
s
handkerchiefs
indeed
rather
undid
the
effects
of
the
wash
but
in
spite
of
this
the
party
certainly
looked
cleaner
than
before
the
first
house
they
came
to
was
a
little
white
house
with
green
shutters
and
a
slate
roof
it
stood
in
a
prim
little
garden
and
down
each
side
of
the
neat
path
were
large
stone
vases
for
flowers
to
grow
in
but
all
the
flowers
were
dead
now
along
one
side
of
the
house
was
a
sort
of
wide
veranda
built
of
poles
and
and
a
vine
crawled
all
over
it
it
was
wider
than
our
english
verandas
and
anthea
thought
it
must
look
lovely
when
the
green
leaves
and
the
grapes
were
there
but
now
there
were
only
dry
stalks
and
stems
with
a
few
withered
leaves
caught
in
them
the
children
walked
up
to
the
front
door
it
was
green
and
narrow
a
chain
with
a
handle
hung
beside
it
and
joined
itself
quite
openly
to
a
rusty
bell
that
hung
under
the
porch
cyril
had
pulled
the
bell
and
its
noisy
clang
was
dying
away
before
the
terrible
thought
came
to
all
cyril
spoke
it
my
hat
he
breathed
we
don
t
know
any
french
at
this
moment
the
door
opened
a
very
tall
lean
lady
with
pale
ringlets
like
paper
or
oak
shavings
stood
before
them
she
had
an
ugly
grey
dress
and
a
black
silk
apron
her
eyes
were
small
and
grey
and
not
pretty
and
the
rims
were
red
as
though
she
had
been
crying
she
addressed
the
party
in
something
that
sounded
like
a
foreign
language
and
ended
with
something
which
they
were
sure
was
a
question
of
course
no
one
could
answer
it
what
does
she
say
robert
asked
looking
down
into
the
hollow
of
his
jacket
where
the
phoenix
was
nestling
but
before
the
phoenix
could
answer
the
lady
s
face
was
lighted
up
by
a
most
charming
smile
you
you
the
england
she
cried
i
love
so
much
the
england
mais
entrez
entrez
donc
tous
enter
then
enter
all
one
essuyes
his
feet
on
the
she
pointed
to
the
mat
we
only
wanted
to
ask
i
shall
say
you
all
that
what
you
wish
said
the
lady
enter
only
so
they
all
went
in
wiping
their
feet
on
a
very
clean
mat
and
putting
the
carpet
in
a
safe
corner
of
the
veranda
the
most
beautiful
days
of
my
life
said
the
lady
as
she
shut
the
door
did
pass
themselves
in
england
and
since
long
time
i
have
not
heard
an
english
voice
to
repeal
me
the
this
warm
welcome
embarrassed
every
one
but
most
the
boys
for
the
floor
of
the
hall
was
of
such
very
clean
red
and
white
tiles
and
the
floor
of
the
so
very
shiny
like
a
black
that
each
felt
as
though
he
had
on
far
more
boots
than
usual
and
far
noisier
there
was
a
wood
fire
very
small
and
very
bright
on
the
hearth
neat
little
logs
laid
on
brass
some
portraits
of
powdered
ladies
and
gentlemen
hung
in
oval
frames
on
the
pale
walls
there
were
silver
candlesticks
on
the
mantelpiece
and
there
were
chairs
and
a
table
very
slim
and
polite
with
slender
legs
the
room
was
extremely
bare
but
with
a
bright
foreign
bareness
that
was
very
cheerful
in
an
odd
way
of
its
own
at
the
end
of
the
polished
table
a
very
little
boy
sat
on
a
footstool
in
a
chair
he
wore
black
velvet
and
the
kind
of
collar
all
frills
and
lacey
that
robert
would
rather
have
died
than
wear
but
then
the
little
french
boy
was
much
younger
than
robert
oh
how
pretty
said
every
one
but
no
one
meant
the
little
french
boy
with
the
velvety
short
knickerbockers
and
the
velvety
short
hair
what
every
one
admired
was
a
little
little
very
green
and
standing
in
a
very
red
little
and
hung
round
with
very
bright
little
things
made
of
tinsel
and
coloured
paper
there
were
tiny
candles
on
the
tree
but
they
were
not
lighted
yet
but
yes
is
it
not
that
it
is
genteel
said
the
lady
sit
down
you
then
and
let
us
the
children
sat
down
in
a
row
on
the
stiff
chairs
against
the
wall
and
the
lady
lighted
a
long
slim
red
taper
at
the
wood
flame
and
then
she
drew
the
curtains
and
lit
the
little
candles
and
when
they
were
all
lighted
the
little
french
boy
suddenly
shouted
bravo
ma
tante
oh
que
c
est
gentil
and
the
english
children
shouted
hooray
then
there
was
a
struggle
in
the
breast
of
robert
and
out
fluttered
the
phoenix
spread
his
gold
wings
flew
to
the
top
of
the
and
perched
there
ah
catch
it
then
cried
the
lady
it
will
itself
burn
your
genteel
parrakeet
it
won
t
said
robert
thank
and
the
little
french
boy
clapped
his
clean
and
tidy
hands
but
the
lady
was
so
anxious
that
the
phoenix
fluttered
down
and
walked
up
and
down
on
the
shiny
table
is
it
that
it
talks
asked
the
lady
and
the
phoenix
replied
in
excellent
french
it
said
parfaitement
madame
oh
the
pretty
parrakeet
said
the
lady
can
it
say
still
of
other
things
and
the
phoenix
replied
this
time
in
english
why
are
you
sad
so
near
the
children
looked
at
it
with
one
gasp
of
horror
and
surprise
for
the
youngest
of
them
knew
that
it
is
far
from
manners
to
notice
that
strangers
have
been
crying
and
much
worse
to
ask
them
the
reason
of
their
tears
and
of
course
the
lady
began
to
cry
again
very
much
indeed
after
calling
the
phoenix
a
bird
without
a
heart
and
she
could
not
find
her
handkerchief
so
anthea
offered
hers
which
was
still
very
damp
and
no
use
at
all
she
also
hugged
the
lady
and
this
seemed
to
be
of
more
use
than
the
handkerchief
so
that
presently
the
lady
stopped
crying
and
found
her
own
handkerchief
and
dried
her
eyes
and
called
anthea
a
cherished
angel
i
am
sorry
we
came
just
when
you
were
so
sad
said
anthea
but
we
really
only
wanted
to
ask
you
whose
that
castle
is
on
the
oh
my
little
angel
said
the
poor
lady
sniffing
and
for
hundreds
of
years
the
castle
is
to
us
to
our
family
it
must
that
i
sell
it
to
some
strangers
and
my
little
henri
who
ignores
all
he
will
not
have
never
the
lands
paternal
but
what
will
you
his
father
my
brother
mr
the
marquis
has
spent
much
of
money
and
it
the
must
despite
the
sentiments
of
familial
respect
that
i
admit
that
my
sainted
father
he
also
how
would
you
feel
if
you
found
a
lot
of
money
hundreds
and
thousands
of
gold
pieces
asked
cyril
the
lady
smiled
sadly
ah
one
has
already
recounted
to
you
the
legend
she
said
it
is
true
that
one
says
that
it
is
long
time
oh
but
long
time
one
of
our
ancestors
has
hid
a
treasure
of
gold
and
of
gold
and
of
gold
enough
to
enrich
my
little
henri
for
the
life
but
all
that
my
children
it
is
but
the
accounts
of
fays
she
means
fairy
stories
whispered
the
phoenix
to
robert
tell
her
what
you
have
so
robert
told
while
anthea
and
jane
hugged
the
lady
for
fear
she
should
faint
for
joy
like
people
in
books
and
they
hugged
her
with
the
earnest
joyous
hugs
of
unselfish
delight
it
s
no
use
explaining
how
we
got
in
said
robert
when
he
had
told
of
the
finding
of
the
treasure
because
you
would
find
it
a
little
difficult
to
understand
and
much
more
difficult
to
believe
but
we
can
show
you
where
the
gold
is
and
help
you
to
fetch
it
the
lady
looked
doubtfully
at
robert
as
she
absently
returned
the
hugs
of
the
girls
no
he
s
not
making
it
up
said
anthea
it
s
true
true
true
and
we
are
so
you
would
not
be
capable
to
torment
an
old
woman
she
said
and
it
is
not
possible
that
it
be
a
it
really
is
true
said
cyril
and
i
congratulate
you
very
his
tone
of
studied
politeness
seemed
to
convince
more
than
the
raptures
of
the
others
if
i
do
not
dream
she
said
henri
come
to
manon
and
you
you
shall
come
all
with
me
to
mr
the
curate
is
it
not
manon
was
a
wrinkled
old
woman
with
a
red
and
yellow
handkerchief
twisted
round
her
head
she
took
henri
who
was
already
sleepy
with
the
excitement
of
his
and
his
visitors
and
when
the
lady
had
put
on
a
stiff
black
cape
and
a
wonderful
black
silk
bonnet
and
a
pair
of
black
wooden
clogs
over
her
black
cashmere
the
whole
party
went
down
the
road
to
a
little
white
house
very
like
the
one
they
had
left
where
an
old
priest
with
a
good
face
welcomed
them
with
a
politeness
so
great
that
it
hid
his
astonishment
the
lady
with
her
french
waving
hands
and
her
shrugging
french
shoulders
and
her
trembling
french
speech
told
the
story
and
now
the
priest
who
knew
no
english
shrugged
his
shoulders
and
waved
his
hands
and
spoke
also
in
french
he
thinks
whispered
the
phoenix
that
her
troubles
have
turned
her
brain
what
a
pity
you
know
no
french
i
do
know
a
lot
of
french
whispered
robert
indignantly
but
it
s
all
about
the
pencil
of
the
gardener
s
son
and
the
penknife
of
the
baker
s
niece
nothing
that
anyone
ever
wants
to
if
speak
the
bird
whispered
he
ll
think
he
s
mad
tell
me
what
to
say
c
est
vrai
monsieur
venez
donc
voir
said
the
phoenix
and
then
robert
earned
the
undying
respect
of
everybody
by
suddenly
saying
very
loudly
and
distinctly
say
vray
mossoo
venny
dong
the
priest
was
disappointed
when
he
found
that
robert
s
french
began
and
ended
with
these
useful
words
but
at
any
rate
he
saw
that
if
the
lady
was
mad
she
was
not
the
only
one
and
he
put
on
a
big
beavery
hat
and
got
a
candle
and
matches
and
a
spade
and
they
all
went
up
the
hill
to
the
wayside
shrine
of
st
john
of
luz
now
said
robert
i
will
go
first
and
show
you
where
it
so
they
prised
the
stone
up
with
a
corner
of
the
spade
and
robert
did
go
first
and
they
all
followed
and
found
the
golden
treasure
exactly
as
they
had
left
it
and
every
one
was
flushed
with
the
joy
of
performing
such
a
wonderfully
kind
action
then
the
lady
and
the
priest
clasped
hands
and
wept
for
joy
as
french
people
do
and
knelt
down
and
touched
the
money
and
talked
very
fast
and
both
together
and
the
lady
embraced
all
the
children
three
times
each
and
called
them
little
garden
angels
and
then
she
and
the
priest
shook
each
other
by
both
hands
again
and
talked
and
talked
and
talked
faster
and
more
frenchy
than
you
would
have
believed
possible
and
the
children
were
struck
dumb
with
joy
and
pleasure
get
away
now
said
the
phoenix
softly
breaking
in
on
the
radiant
dream
so
the
children
crept
away
and
out
through
the
little
shrine
and
the
lady
and
the
priest
were
so
tearfully
talkatively
happy
that
they
never
noticed
that
the
guardian
angels
had
gone
the
garden
angels
ran
down
the
hill
to
the
lady
s
little
house
where
they
had
left
the
carpet
on
the
veranda
and
they
spread
it
out
and
said
home
and
no
one
saw
them
disappear
except
little
henri
who
had
flattened
his
nose
into
a
white
button
against
the
and
when
he
tried
to
tell
his
aunt
she
thought
he
had
been
dreaming
so
that
was
all
right
it
is
much
the
best
thing
we
ve
done
said
anthea
when
they
talked
it
over
at
in
the
future
we
ll
only
do
kind
actions
with
the
ahem
said
the
phoenix
i
beg
your
pardon
said
anthea
oh
nothing
said
the
bird
i
was
only
thinking
chapter
mews
from
persia
when
you
hear
that
the
four
children
found
themselves
at
waterloo
station
quite
and
with
no
one
to
meet
them
it
may
make
you
think
that
their
parents
were
neither
kind
nor
careful
but
if
you
think
this
you
will
be
wrong
the
fact
is
mother
arranged
with
aunt
emma
that
she
was
to
meet
the
children
at
waterloo
when
they
went
back
from
their
christmas
holiday
at
lyndhurst
the
train
was
fixed
but
not
the
day
then
mother
wrote
to
aunt
emma
giving
her
careful
instructions
about
the
day
and
the
hour
and
about
luggage
and
cabs
and
things
and
gave
the
letter
to
robert
to
post
but
the
hounds
happened
to
meet
near
rufus
stone
that
morning
and
what
is
more
on
the
way
to
the
meet
they
met
robert
and
robert
met
them
and
instantly
forgot
all
about
posting
aunt
emma
s
letter
and
never
thought
of
it
again
until
he
and
the
others
had
wandered
three
times
up
and
down
the
platform
at
waterloo
which
makes
six
in
all
and
had
bumped
against
old
gentlemen
and
stared
in
the
faces
of
ladies
and
been
shoved
by
people
in
a
hurry
and
by
porters
with
trucks
and
were
quite
quite
sure
that
aunt
emma
was
not
there
then
suddenly
the
true
truth
of
what
he
had
forgotten
to
do
came
home
to
robert
and
he
said
oh
crikey
and
stood
still
with
his
mouth
open
and
let
a
porter
with
a
gladstone
bag
in
each
hand
and
a
bundle
of
umbrellas
under
one
arm
blunder
heavily
into
him
and
never
so
much
as
said
where
are
you
shoving
to
now
or
look
out
where
you
re
going
can
t
you
the
heavier
bag
smote
him
at
the
knee
and
he
staggered
but
he
said
nothing
when
the
others
understood
what
was
the
matter
i
think
they
told
robert
what
they
thought
of
him
we
must
take
the
train
to
croydon
said
anthea
and
find
aunt
yes
said
cyril
and
precious
pleased
those
jevonses
would
be
to
see
us
and
our
aunt
emma
indeed
was
staying
with
some
jevonses
very
prim
people
they
were
and
wore
very
smart
blouses
and
they
were
fond
of
matinees
and
shopping
and
they
did
not
care
about
children
i
know
mother
would
be
pleased
to
see
us
if
we
went
back
said
jane
yes
she
would
but
she
d
think
it
was
not
right
to
show
she
was
pleased
because
it
s
bob
s
fault
we
re
not
met
don
t
i
know
the
sort
of
thing
said
cyril
besides
we
ve
no
tin
no
we
ve
got
enough
for
a
growler
among
us
but
not
enough
for
tickets
to
the
new
forest
we
must
just
go
home
they
won
t
be
so
savage
when
they
find
we
ve
really
got
home
all
right
you
know
auntie
was
only
going
to
take
us
home
in
a
i
believe
we
ought
to
go
to
croydon
anthea
insisted
aunt
emma
would
be
out
to
a
dead
cert
said
robert
those
jevonses
go
to
the
theatre
every
afternoon
i
believe
besides
there
s
the
phoenix
at
home
and
the
carpet
i
votes
we
call
a
a
cabman
was
called
his
cab
was
one
of
the
kind
with
straw
in
the
bottom
and
he
was
asked
by
anthea
to
drive
them
very
carefully
to
their
address
this
he
did
and
the
price
he
asked
for
doing
so
was
exactly
the
value
of
the
gold
coin
grandpapa
had
given
cyril
for
christmas
this
cast
a
gloom
but
cyril
would
never
have
stooped
to
argue
about
a
for
fear
the
cabman
should
think
he
was
not
accustomed
to
take
cabs
whenever
he
wanted
them
for
a
reason
that
was
something
like
this
he
told
the
cabman
to
put
the
luggage
on
the
steps
and
waited
till
the
wheels
of
the
growler
had
grittily
retired
before
he
rang
the
bell
you
see
he
said
with
his
hand
on
the
handle
we
don
t
want
cook
and
eliza
asking
us
before
him
how
it
is
we
ve
come
home
alone
as
if
we
were
here
he
rang
the
bell
and
the
moment
its
answering
clang
was
heard
every
one
felt
that
it
would
be
some
time
before
that
bell
was
answered
the
sound
of
a
bell
is
quite
different
somehow
when
there
is
anyone
inside
the
house
who
hears
it
i
can
t
tell
you
why
that
is
but
so
it
is
i
expect
they
re
changing
their
dresses
said
jane
too
late
said
anthea
it
must
be
past
five
i
expect
eliza
s
gone
to
post
a
letter
and
cook
s
gone
to
see
the
cyril
rang
again
and
the
bell
did
its
best
to
inform
the
listening
children
that
there
was
really
no
one
human
in
the
house
they
rang
again
and
listened
intently
the
hearts
of
all
sank
low
it
is
a
terrible
thing
to
be
locked
out
of
your
own
house
on
a
dark
muggy
january
evening
there
is
no
gas
on
anywhere
said
jane
in
a
broken
voice
i
expect
they
ve
left
the
gas
on
once
too
often
and
the
draught
blew
it
out
and
they
re
suffocated
in
their
beds
father
always
said
they
would
some
day
said
robert
cheerfully
let
s
go
and
fetch
a
policeman
said
anthea
trembling
and
be
taken
up
for
trying
to
be
burglars
no
thank
you
said
cyril
i
heard
father
read
out
of
the
paper
about
a
young
man
who
got
into
his
own
mother
s
house
and
they
got
him
made
a
burglar
only
the
other
i
only
hope
the
gas
hasn
t
hurt
the
phoenix
said
anthea
it
said
it
wanted
to
stay
in
the
bathroom
cupboard
and
i
thought
it
would
be
all
right
because
the
servants
never
clean
that
out
but
if
it
s
gone
and
got
out
and
been
choked
by
gas
and
besides
directly
we
open
the
door
we
shall
be
choked
too
i
knew
we
ought
to
have
gone
to
aunt
emma
at
croydon
oh
squirrel
i
wish
we
had
let
s
go
shut
up
said
her
brother
briefly
there
s
some
one
rattling
the
latch
every
one
listened
with
all
its
ears
and
every
one
stood
back
as
far
from
the
door
as
the
steps
would
allow
the
latch
rattled
and
clicked
then
the
flap
of
the
lifted
itself
every
one
saw
it
by
the
flickering
light
of
the
that
shone
through
the
leafless
by
the
gate
a
golden
eye
seemed
to
wink
at
them
through
the
and
a
cautious
beak
whispered
are
you
alone
it
s
the
phoenix
said
every
one
in
a
voice
so
joyous
and
so
full
of
relief
as
to
be
a
sort
of
whispered
shout
hush
said
the
voice
from
the
slit
your
slaves
have
gone
the
latch
of
this
portal
is
too
stiff
for
my
beak
but
at
the
side
the
little
window
above
the
shelf
whereon
your
bread
lies
it
is
not
righto
said
cyril
and
anthea
added
i
wish
you
d
meet
us
there
dear
the
children
crept
round
to
the
pantry
window
it
is
at
the
side
of
the
house
and
there
is
a
green
gate
labelled
tradesmen
s
entrance
which
is
always
kept
bolted
but
if
you
get
one
foot
on
the
fence
between
you
and
next
door
and
one
on
the
handle
of
the
gate
you
are
over
before
you
know
where
you
are
this
at
least
was
the
experience
of
cyril
and
robert
and
even
if
the
truth
must
be
told
of
anthea
and
jane
so
in
almost
no
time
all
four
were
in
the
narrow
gravelled
passage
that
runs
between
that
house
and
the
next
then
robert
made
a
back
and
cyril
hoisted
himself
up
and
got
his
knee
on
the
concrete
he
dived
into
the
pantry
head
first
as
one
dives
into
water
and
his
legs
waved
in
the
air
as
he
went
just
as
your
legs
do
when
you
are
first
beginning
to
learn
to
dive
the
soles
of
his
boots
squarish
muddy
patches
disappeared
give
me
a
leg
up
said
robert
to
his
sisters
no
you
don
t
said
jane
firmly
i
m
not
going
to
be
left
outside
here
with
just
anthea
and
have
something
creep
up
behind
us
out
of
the
dark
squirrel
can
go
and
open
the
back
a
light
had
sprung
awake
in
the
pantry
cyril
always
said
the
phoenix
turned
the
gas
on
with
its
beak
and
lighted
it
with
a
waft
of
its
wing
but
he
was
excited
at
the
time
and
perhaps
he
really
did
it
himself
with
matches
and
then
forgot
all
about
it
he
let
the
others
in
by
the
back
door
and
when
it
had
been
bolted
again
the
children
went
all
over
the
house
and
lighted
every
single
they
could
find
for
they
couldn
t
help
feeling
that
this
was
just
the
dark
dreary
winter
s
evening
when
an
armed
burglar
might
easily
be
expected
to
appear
at
any
moment
there
is
nothing
like
light
when
you
are
afraid
of
burglars
or
of
anything
else
for
that
matter
and
when
all
the
were
lighted
it
was
quite
clear
that
the
phoenix
had
made
no
mistake
and
that
eliza
and
cook
were
really
out
and
that
there
was
no
one
in
the
house
except
the
four
children
and
the
phoenix
and
the
carpet
and
the
blackbeetles
who
lived
in
the
cupboards
on
each
side
of
the
nursery
these
last
were
very
pleased
that
the
children
had
come
home
again
especially
when
anthea
had
lighted
the
nursery
fire
but
as
usual
the
children
treated
the
loving
little
blackbeetles
with
coldness
and
disdain
i
wonder
whether
you
know
how
to
light
a
fire
i
don
t
mean
how
to
strike
a
match
and
set
fire
to
the
corners
of
the
paper
in
a
fire
someone
has
laid
ready
but
how
to
lay
and
light
a
fire
all
by
yourself
i
will
tell
you
how
anthea
did
it
and
if
ever
you
have
to
light
one
yourself
you
may
remember
how
it
is
done
first
she
raked
out
the
ashes
of
the
fire
that
had
burned
there
a
week
ago
for
eliza
had
actually
never
done
this
though
she
had
had
plenty
of
time
in
doing
this
anthea
knocked
her
knuckle
and
made
it
bleed
then
she
laid
the
largest
and
handsomest
cinders
in
the
bottom
of
the
grate
then
she
took
a
sheet
of
old
newspaper
you
ought
never
to
light
a
fire
with
s
newspaper
it
will
not
burn
well
and
there
are
other
reasons
against
it
and
tore
it
into
four
quarters
and
screwed
each
of
these
into
a
loose
ball
and
put
them
on
the
cinders
then
she
got
a
bundle
of
wood
and
broke
the
string
and
stuck
the
sticks
in
so
that
their
front
ends
rested
on
the
bars
and
the
back
ends
on
the
back
of
the
paper
balls
in
doing
this
she
cut
her
finger
slightly
with
the
string
and
when
she
broke
it
two
of
the
sticks
jumped
up
and
hit
her
on
the
cheek
then
she
put
more
cinders
and
some
bits
of
coal
no
dust
she
put
most
of
that
on
her
hands
but
there
seemed
to
be
enough
left
for
her
face
then
she
lighted
the
edges
of
the
paper
balls
and
waited
till
she
heard
the
of
the
wood
as
it
began
to
burn
then
she
went
and
washed
her
hands
and
face
under
the
tap
in
the
back
kitchen
of
course
you
need
not
bark
your
knuckles
or
cut
your
finger
or
bruise
your
cheek
with
wood
or
black
yourself
all
over
but
otherwise
this
is
a
very
good
way
to
light
a
fire
in
london
in
the
real
country
fires
are
lighted
in
a
different
and
prettier
way
but
it
is
always
good
to
wash
your
hands
and
face
afterwards
wherever
you
are
while
anthea
was
delighting
the
poor
little
blackbeetles
with
the
cheerful
blaze
jane
had
set
the
table
for
i
was
going
to
say
tea
but
the
meal
of
which
i
am
speaking
was
not
exactly
tea
let
us
call
it
a
meal
there
was
tea
certainly
for
anthea
s
fire
blazed
and
crackled
so
kindly
that
it
really
seemed
to
be
affectionately
inviting
the
kettle
to
come
and
sit
upon
its
lap
so
the
kettle
was
brought
and
tea
made
but
no
milk
could
be
found
so
every
one
had
six
lumps
of
sugar
to
each
cup
instead
the
things
to
eat
on
the
other
hand
were
nicer
than
usual
the
boys
looked
about
very
carefully
and
found
in
the
pantry
some
cold
tongue
bread
butter
cheese
and
part
of
a
cold
pudding
very
much
nicer
than
cook
ever
made
when
they
were
at
home
and
in
the
kitchen
cupboard
was
half
a
christmassy
cake
a
pot
of
strawberry
jam
and
about
a
pound
of
mixed
candied
fruit
with
soft
crumbly
slabs
of
delicious
sugar
in
each
cup
of
lemon
orange
or
citron
it
was
indeed
as
jane
said
a
banquet
fit
for
an
arabian
the
phoenix
perched
on
robert
s
chair
and
listened
kindly
and
politely
to
all
they
had
to
tell
it
about
their
visit
to
lyndhurst
and
underneath
the
table
by
just
stretching
a
toe
down
rather
far
the
faithful
carpet
could
be
felt
by
all
even
by
jane
whose
legs
were
very
short
your
slaves
will
not
return
said
the
phoenix
they
sleep
under
the
roof
of
the
cook
s
stepmother
s
aunt
who
is
i
gather
hostess
to
a
large
party
in
honour
of
her
husband
s
cousin
s
s
mother
s
ninetieth
i
don
t
think
they
ought
to
have
gone
without
leave
said
anthea
however
many
relations
they
have
or
however
old
they
are
but
i
suppose
we
ought
to
wash
it
s
not
our
business
about
the
leave
said
cyril
firmly
but
i
simply
won
t
wash
up
for
them
we
got
it
and
we
ll
clear
it
away
and
then
we
ll
go
somewhere
on
the
carpet
it
s
not
often
we
get
a
chance
of
being
out
all
night
we
can
go
right
away
to
the
other
side
of
the
equator
to
the
tropical
climes
and
see
the
sun
rise
over
the
great
pacific
right
you
are
said
robert
i
always
did
want
to
see
the
southern
cross
and
the
stars
as
big
as
don
t
go
said
anthea
very
earnestly
because
i
couldn
t
i
m
sure
mother
wouldn
t
like
us
to
leave
the
house
and
i
should
hate
to
be
left
here
i
d
stay
with
you
said
jane
loyally
i
know
you
would
said
anthea
gratefully
but
even
with
you
i
d
much
rather
well
said
cyril
trying
to
be
kind
and
amiable
i
don
t
want
you
to
do
anything
you
think
s
wrong
but
he
was
silent
this
silence
said
many
things
i
don
t
see
robert
was
beginning
when
anthea
interrupted
i
m
quite
sure
sometimes
you
just
think
a
thing
s
wrong
and
sometimes
you
know
and
this
is
a
know
the
phoenix
turned
kind
golden
eyes
on
her
and
opened
a
friendly
beak
to
say
when
it
is
as
you
say
a
know
time
there
is
no
more
to
be
said
and
your
noble
brothers
would
never
leave
of
course
not
said
cyril
rather
quickly
and
robert
said
so
too
i
myself
the
phoenix
went
on
am
willing
to
help
in
any
way
possible
i
will
go
personally
either
by
carpet
or
on
the
wing
and
fetch
you
anything
you
can
think
of
to
amuse
you
during
the
evening
in
order
to
waste
no
time
i
could
go
while
you
wash
why
it
went
on
in
a
musing
voice
does
one
wash
up
teacups
and
wash
down
the
stairs
you
couldn
t
wash
stairs
up
you
know
said
anthea
unless
you
began
at
the
bottom
and
went
up
feet
first
as
you
washed
i
wish
cook
would
try
that
way
for
a
i
don
t
said
cyril
briefly
i
should
hate
the
look
of
her
boots
sticking
this
is
mere
trifling
said
the
phoenix
come
decide
what
i
shall
fetch
for
you
i
can
get
you
anything
you
but
of
course
they
couldn
t
decide
many
things
were
suggested
a
jewelled
chessmen
an
elephant
a
bicycle
a
books
with
pictures
musical
instruments
and
many
other
things
but
a
musical
instrument
is
agreeable
only
to
the
player
unless
he
has
learned
to
play
it
really
well
books
are
not
sociable
bicycles
can
not
be
ridden
without
going
out
of
doors
and
the
same
is
true
of
and
elephants
only
two
people
can
play
chess
at
once
with
one
set
of
chessmen
and
anyway
it
s
very
much
too
much
like
lessons
for
a
game
and
only
one
can
ride
on
a
suddenly
in
the
midst
of
the
discussion
the
phoenix
spread
its
wings
and
fluttered
to
the
floor
and
from
there
it
spoke
i
gather
it
said
from
the
carpet
that
it
wants
you
to
let
it
go
to
its
old
home
where
it
was
born
and
brought
up
and
it
will
return
within
the
hour
laden
with
a
number
of
the
most
beautiful
and
delightful
products
of
its
native
what
is
its
native
land
i
didn
t
gather
but
since
you
can
t
agree
and
time
is
passing
and
the
are
not
washed
down
i
mean
washed
up
i
votes
we
do
said
robert
it
ll
stop
all
this
jaw
anyway
and
it
s
not
bad
to
have
surprises
perhaps
it
s
a
turkey
carpet
and
it
might
bring
us
turkish
or
a
turkish
patrol
said
robert
or
a
turkish
bath
said
anthea
or
a
turkish
towel
said
jane
nonsense
robert
urged
it
said
beautiful
and
delightful
and
towels
and
baths
aren
t
that
however
good
they
may
be
for
you
let
it
go
i
suppose
it
won
t
give
us
the
slip
he
added
pushing
back
his
chair
and
standing
up
hush
said
the
phoenix
how
can
you
don
t
trample
on
its
feelings
just
because
it
s
only
a
but
how
can
it
do
it
unless
one
of
us
is
on
it
to
do
the
wishing
asked
robert
he
spoke
with
a
rising
hope
that
it
might
be
necessary
for
one
to
go
and
why
not
robert
but
the
phoenix
quickly
threw
cold
water
on
his
dream
why
you
just
write
your
wish
on
a
paper
and
pin
it
on
the
so
a
leaf
was
torn
from
anthea
s
arithmetic
book
and
on
it
cyril
wrote
in
large
the
following
we
wish
you
to
go
to
your
dear
native
home
and
bring
back
the
most
beautiful
and
delightful
productions
of
it
you
can
and
not
to
be
gone
long
please
signed
cyril
robert
anthea
jane
then
the
paper
was
laid
on
the
carpet
writing
down
please
said
the
phoenix
the
carpet
can
t
read
a
paper
whose
back
is
turned
to
it
any
more
than
you
it
was
pinned
fast
and
the
table
and
chairs
having
been
moved
the
carpet
simply
and
suddenly
vanished
rather
like
a
patch
of
water
on
a
hearth
under
a
fierce
fire
the
edges
got
smaller
and
smaller
and
then
it
disappeared
from
sight
it
may
take
it
some
time
to
collect
the
beautiful
and
delightful
things
said
the
phoenix
i
should
wash
up
i
mean
wash
so
they
did
there
was
plenty
of
hot
water
left
in
the
kettle
and
every
one
helped
even
the
phoenix
who
took
up
cups
by
their
handles
with
its
clever
claws
and
dipped
them
in
the
hot
water
and
then
stood
them
on
the
table
ready
for
anthea
to
dry
them
but
the
bird
was
rather
slow
because
as
it
said
though
it
was
not
above
any
sort
of
honest
work
messing
about
with
was
not
exactly
what
it
had
been
brought
up
to
everything
was
nicely
washed
up
and
dried
and
put
in
its
proper
place
and
the
washed
and
hung
on
the
edge
of
the
copper
to
dry
and
the
was
hung
on
the
line
that
goes
across
the
scullery
if
you
are
a
duchess
s
child
or
a
king
s
or
a
person
of
high
social
position
s
child
you
will
perhaps
not
know
the
difference
between
a
and
a
but
in
that
case
your
nurse
has
been
better
instructed
than
you
and
she
will
tell
you
all
about
it
and
just
as
eight
hands
and
one
pair
of
claws
were
being
dried
on
the
behind
the
scullery
door
there
came
a
strange
sound
from
the
other
side
of
the
kitchen
wall
the
side
where
the
nursery
was
it
was
a
very
strange
sound
indeed
most
odd
and
unlike
any
other
sounds
the
children
had
ever
heard
at
least
they
had
heard
sounds
as
much
like
it
as
a
toy
engine
s
whistle
is
like
a
steam
siren
s
the
carpet
s
come
back
said
robert
and
the
others
felt
that
he
was
right
but
what
has
it
brought
with
it
asked
jane
it
sounds
like
leviathan
that
great
it
couldn
t
have
been
made
in
india
and
have
brought
elephants
even
baby
ones
would
be
rather
awful
in
that
room
said
cyril
i
vote
we
take
it
in
turns
to
squint
through
the
they
did
in
the
order
of
their
ages
the
phoenix
being
the
eldest
by
some
thousands
of
years
was
entitled
to
the
first
peep
but
excuse
me
it
said
ruffling
its
golden
feathers
and
sneezing
softly
looking
through
keyholes
always
gives
me
a
cold
in
my
golden
so
cyril
looked
i
see
something
grey
moving
said
he
it
s
a
zoological
garden
of
some
sort
i
bet
said
robert
when
he
had
taken
his
turn
and
the
soft
rustling
bustling
ruffling
scuffling
shuffling
fluffling
noise
went
on
inside
can
t
see
anything
said
anthea
my
eye
tickles
then
jane
s
turn
came
and
she
put
her
eye
to
the
keyhole
it
s
a
giant
she
said
and
it
s
asleep
all
over
the
giant
cats
are
tigers
father
said
no
he
didn
t
he
said
tigers
were
giant
cats
it
s
not
at
all
the
same
it
s
no
use
sending
the
carpet
to
fetch
precious
things
for
you
if
you
re
afraid
to
look
at
them
when
they
come
said
the
phoenix
sensibly
and
cyril
being
the
eldest
said
come
on
and
turned
the
handle
the
gas
had
been
left
full
on
after
tea
and
everything
in
the
room
could
be
plainly
seen
by
the
ten
eyes
at
the
door
at
least
not
everything
for
though
the
carpet
was
there
it
was
invisible
because
it
was
completely
covered
by
the
hundred
and
beautiful
objects
which
it
had
brought
from
its
birthplace
my
hat
cyril
remarked
i
never
thought
about
its
being
a
persian
yet
it
was
now
plain
that
it
was
so
for
the
beautiful
objects
which
it
had
brought
back
were
cats
persian
cats
grey
persian
cats
and
there
were
as
i
have
said
of
them
and
they
were
sitting
on
the
carpet
as
close
as
they
could
get
to
each
other
but
the
moment
the
children
entered
the
room
the
cats
rose
and
stretched
and
spread
and
overflowed
from
the
carpet
to
the
floor
and
in
an
instant
the
floor
was
a
sea
of
moving
mewing
pussishness
and
the
children
with
one
accord
climbed
to
the
table
and
gathered
up
their
legs
and
the
people
next
door
knocked
on
the
wall
and
indeed
no
wonder
for
the
mews
were
persian
and
piercing
this
is
pretty
poor
sport
said
cyril
what
s
the
matter
with
the
bounders
i
imagine
that
they
are
hungry
said
the
phoenix
if
you
were
to
feed
them
we
haven
t
anything
to
feed
them
with
said
anthea
in
despair
and
she
stroked
the
nearest
persian
back
oh
pussies
do
be
quiet
we
can
t
hear
ourselves
she
had
to
shout
this
entreaty
for
the
mews
were
growing
deafening
and
it
would
take
pounds
and
pounds
worth
of
cat
let
s
ask
the
carpet
to
take
them
away
said
robert
but
the
girls
said
they
are
so
soft
and
pussy
said
jane
and
valuable
said
anthea
hastily
we
can
sell
them
for
lots
and
lots
of
why
not
send
the
carpet
to
get
food
for
them
suggested
the
phoenix
and
its
golden
voice
came
harsh
and
cracked
with
the
effort
it
had
to
be
make
to
be
heard
above
the
increasing
fierceness
of
the
persian
mews
so
it
was
written
that
the
carpet
should
bring
food
for
persian
cats
and
the
paper
was
pinned
to
the
carpet
as
before
the
carpet
seemed
to
gather
itself
together
and
the
cats
dropped
off
it
as
raindrops
do
from
your
mackintosh
when
you
shake
it
and
the
carpet
disappeared
unless
you
have
had
and
persian
cats
in
one
small
room
all
hungry
and
all
saying
so
in
unmistakable
mews
you
can
form
but
a
poor
idea
of
the
noise
that
now
deafened
the
children
and
the
phoenix
the
cats
did
not
seem
to
have
been
at
all
properly
brought
up
they
seemed
to
have
no
idea
of
its
being
a
mistake
in
manners
to
ask
for
meals
in
a
strange
house
let
alone
to
howl
for
them
and
they
mewed
and
they
mewed
and
they
mewed
and
they
mewed
till
the
children
poked
their
fingers
into
their
ears
and
waited
in
silent
agony
wondering
why
the
whole
of
camden
town
did
not
come
knocking
at
the
door
to
ask
what
was
the
matter
and
only
hoping
that
the
food
for
the
cats
would
come
before
the
neighbours
did
and
before
all
the
secret
of
the
carpet
and
the
phoenix
had
to
be
given
away
beyond
recall
to
an
indignant
neighbourhood
the
cats
mewed
and
mewed
and
twisted
their
persian
forms
in
and
out
and
unfolded
their
persian
tails
and
the
children
and
the
phoenix
huddled
together
on
the
table
the
phoenix
robert
noticed
suddenly
was
trembling
so
many
cats
it
said
and
they
might
not
know
i
was
the
phoenix
these
accidents
happen
so
quickly
it
quite
this
was
a
danger
of
which
the
children
had
not
thought
creep
in
cried
robert
opening
his
jacket
and
the
phoenix
crept
in
only
just
in
time
for
green
eyes
had
glared
pink
noses
had
sniffed
white
whiskers
had
twitched
and
as
robert
buttoned
his
coat
he
disappeared
to
the
waist
in
a
wave
of
eager
grey
persian
fur
and
on
the
instant
the
good
carpet
slapped
itself
down
on
the
floor
and
it
was
covered
with
rats
three
hundred
and
of
them
i
believe
two
for
each
cat
how
horrible
cried
anthea
oh
take
them
away
take
yourself
away
said
the
phoenix
and
i
wish
we
d
never
had
a
carpet
said
anthea
in
tears
they
hustled
and
crowded
out
of
the
door
and
shut
it
and
locked
it
cyril
with
great
presence
of
mind
lit
a
candle
and
turned
off
the
gas
at
the
main
the
rats
ll
have
a
better
chance
in
the
dark
he
said
the
mewing
had
ceased
every
one
listened
in
breathless
silence
we
all
know
that
cats
eat
rats
it
is
one
of
the
first
things
we
read
in
our
little
brown
reading
books
but
all
those
cats
eating
all
those
rats
it
wouldn
t
bear
thinking
of
suddenly
robert
sniffed
in
the
silence
of
the
dark
kitchen
where
the
only
candle
was
burning
all
on
one
side
because
of
the
draught
what
a
funny
scent
he
said
and
as
he
spoke
a
lantern
flashed
its
light
through
the
window
of
the
kitchen
a
face
peered
in
and
a
voice
said
what
s
all
this
row
about
you
let
me
it
was
the
voice
of
the
police
robert
to
the
window
and
spoke
through
the
pane
that
had
been
a
little
cracked
since
cyril
accidentally
knocked
it
with
a
when
he
was
playing
at
balancing
it
on
his
nose
it
was
after
they
had
been
to
a
circus
what
do
you
mean
he
said
there
s
no
row
you
listen
everything
s
as
quiet
as
and
indeed
it
was
the
strange
sweet
scent
grew
stronger
and
the
phoenix
put
out
its
beak
the
policeman
hesitated
they
re
said
the
phoenix
i
suppose
some
cats
eat
them
but
never
persian
ones
what
a
mistake
for
a
carpet
to
make
oh
what
a
night
we
re
having
do
go
away
said
robert
nervously
we
re
just
going
to
bed
that
s
our
bedroom
candle
there
isn
t
any
row
everything
s
as
quiet
as
a
a
wild
chorus
of
mews
drowned
his
words
and
with
the
mews
were
mingled
the
shrieks
of
the
what
had
happened
had
the
cats
tasted
them
before
deciding
that
they
disliked
the
flavour
i
m
in
said
the
policeman
you
ve
got
a
cat
shut
up
a
cat
said
cyril
oh
my
only
aunt
a
cat
come
in
then
said
robert
it
s
your
own
look
out
i
advise
you
not
wait
a
shake
and
i
ll
undo
the
side
he
undid
the
side
gate
and
the
policeman
very
cautiously
came
in
and
there
in
the
kitchen
by
the
light
of
one
candle
with
the
mewing
and
the
screaming
going
like
a
dozen
steam
sirens
twenty
waiting
on
and
half
a
hundred
squeaking
pumps
four
agitated
voices
shouted
to
the
policeman
four
mixed
and
wholly
different
explanations
of
the
very
mixed
events
of
the
evening
did
you
ever
try
to
explain
the
simplest
thing
to
a
policeman
chapter
the
cats
the
cow
and
the
burglar
the
nursery
was
full
of
persian
cats
and
that
had
been
brought
there
by
the
wishing
carpet
the
cats
were
mewing
and
the
were
squeaking
so
that
you
could
hardly
hear
yourself
speak
in
the
kitchen
were
the
four
children
one
candle
a
concealed
phoenix
and
a
very
visible
policeman
now
then
look
here
said
the
policeman
very
loudly
and
he
pointed
his
lantern
at
each
child
in
turn
what
s
the
meaning
of
this
here
yelling
and
caterwauling
i
tell
you
you
ve
got
a
cat
here
and
some
one
s
a
of
it
what
do
you
mean
by
it
eh
it
was
five
to
one
counting
the
phoenix
but
the
policeman
who
was
one
was
of
unusually
fine
size
and
the
five
including
the
phoenix
were
small
the
mews
and
the
squeaks
grew
softer
and
in
the
comparative
silence
cyril
said
it
s
true
there
are
a
few
cats
here
but
we
ve
not
hurt
them
it
s
quite
the
opposite
we
ve
just
fed
it
don
t
sound
like
it
said
the
policeman
grimly
i
daresay
they
re
not
real
cats
said
jane
madly
perhaps
they
re
only
i
ll
you
my
lady
was
the
brief
response
of
the
force
if
you
understood
anything
except
people
who
do
murders
and
stealings
and
naughty
things
like
that
i
d
tell
you
all
about
it
said
robert
but
i
m
certain
you
don
t
you
re
not
meant
to
shove
your
oar
into
people
s
private
you
re
only
supposed
to
interfere
when
people
shout
murder
and
stop
thief
in
the
street
so
there
the
policeman
assured
them
that
he
should
see
about
that
and
at
this
point
the
phoenix
who
had
been
making
itself
small
on
the
under
the
dresser
among
the
saucepan
lids
and
the
walked
on
claws
in
a
noiseless
and
modest
manner
and
left
the
room
unnoticed
by
any
one
oh
don
t
be
so
horrid
anthea
was
saying
gently
and
earnestly
we
love
cats
dear
things
we
wouldn
t
hurt
them
for
worlds
would
we
pussy
and
jane
answered
that
of
course
they
wouldn
t
and
still
the
policeman
seemed
unmoved
by
their
eloquence
now
look
here
he
said
i
m
to
see
what
s
in
that
room
beyond
there
and
his
voice
was
drowned
in
a
wild
burst
of
mewing
and
squeaking
and
as
soon
as
it
died
down
all
four
children
began
to
explain
at
once
and
though
the
squeaking
and
mewing
were
not
at
their
very
loudest
yet
there
was
quite
enough
of
both
to
make
it
very
hard
for
the
policeman
to
understand
a
single
word
of
any
of
the
four
wholly
different
explanations
now
poured
out
to
him
stow
it
he
said
at
last
i
m
into
the
next
room
in
the
execution
of
my
duty
i
m
to
use
my
eyes
my
ears
have
gone
off
their
chumps
what
with
you
and
them
and
he
pushed
robert
aside
and
strode
through
the
door
don
t
say
i
didn
t
warn
you
said
robert
it
s
tigers
really
said
jane
father
said
so
i
wouldn
t
go
in
if
i
were
but
the
policeman
was
quite
stony
nothing
any
one
said
seemed
to
make
any
difference
to
him
some
policemen
are
like
this
i
believe
he
strode
down
the
passage
and
in
another
moment
he
would
have
been
in
the
room
with
all
the
cats
and
all
the
rats
musk
but
at
that
very
instant
a
thin
sharp
voice
screamed
from
the
street
outside
murder
murder
stop
thief
the
policeman
stopped
with
one
regulation
boot
heavily
poised
in
the
air
eh
he
said
and
again
the
shrieks
sounded
shrilly
and
piercingly
from
the
dark
street
outside
come
on
said
robert
come
and
look
after
cats
while
somebody
s
being
killed
for
robert
had
an
inside
feeling
that
told
him
quite
plainly
who
it
was
that
was
screaming
you
young
rip
said
the
policeman
i
ll
settle
up
with
you
and
he
rushed
out
and
the
children
heard
his
boots
going
weightily
along
the
pavement
and
the
screams
also
going
along
rather
ahead
of
the
policeman
and
both
the
and
the
policeman
s
boots
faded
away
in
the
remote
distance
then
robert
smacked
his
knickerbocker
loudly
with
his
palm
and
said
good
old
phoenix
i
should
know
its
golden
voice
and
then
every
one
understood
how
cleverly
the
phoenix
had
caught
at
what
robert
had
said
about
the
real
work
of
a
policeman
being
to
look
after
murderers
and
thieves
and
not
after
cats
and
all
hearts
were
filled
with
admiring
affection
but
he
ll
come
back
said
anthea
mournfully
as
soon
as
it
finds
the
murderer
is
only
a
bright
vision
of
a
dream
and
there
isn
t
one
at
all
no
he
won
t
said
the
soft
voice
of
the
clever
phoenix
as
it
flew
in
he
does
not
know
where
your
house
is
i
heard
him
own
as
much
to
a
fellow
mercenary
oh
what
a
night
we
are
having
lock
the
door
and
let
us
rid
ourselves
of
this
intolerable
smell
of
the
perfume
peculiar
to
the
and
to
the
house
of
the
trimmers
of
beards
if
you
ll
excuse
me
i
will
go
to
bed
i
am
worn
it
was
cyril
who
wrote
the
paper
that
told
the
carpet
to
take
away
the
rats
and
bring
milk
because
there
seemed
to
be
no
doubt
in
any
breast
that
however
persian
cats
may
be
they
must
like
milk
let
s
hope
it
won
t
be
said
anthea
in
gloom
as
she
pinned
the
paper
on
the
carpet
is
there
such
a
thing
as
a
she
added
anxiously
as
the
carpet
shrivelled
and
vanished
i
do
hope
not
perhaps
really
it
would
have
been
wiser
to
let
the
carpet
take
the
cats
away
it
s
getting
quite
late
and
we
can
t
keep
them
all
oh
can
t
we
was
the
bitter
rejoinder
of
robert
who
had
been
fastening
the
side
door
you
might
have
consulted
me
he
went
on
i
m
not
such
an
idiot
as
some
why
whatever
don
t
you
see
we
ve
jolly
well
got
to
keep
the
cats
all
night
oh
get
down
you
furry
beasts
because
we
ve
had
three
wishes
out
of
the
old
carpet
now
and
we
can
t
get
any
more
till
the
liveliness
of
persian
mews
alone
prevented
the
occurrence
of
a
dismal
silence
anthea
spoke
first
never
mind
she
said
do
you
know
i
really
do
think
they
re
quieting
down
a
bit
perhaps
they
heard
us
say
they
can
t
understand
english
said
jane
you
forget
they
re
persian
cats
well
said
anthea
rather
sharply
for
she
was
tired
and
anxious
who
told
you
milk
wasn
t
persian
for
milk
lots
of
english
words
are
just
the
same
in
french
at
least
i
know
miaw
is
and
croquet
and
fiance
oh
pussies
do
be
quiet
let
s
stroke
them
as
hard
as
we
can
with
both
hands
and
perhaps
they
ll
so
every
one
stroked
grey
fur
till
their
hands
were
tired
and
as
soon
as
a
cat
had
been
stroked
enough
to
make
it
stop
mewing
it
was
pushed
gently
away
and
another
mewing
mouser
was
approached
by
the
hands
of
the
strokers
and
the
noise
was
really
more
than
half
purr
when
the
carpet
suddenly
appeared
in
its
proper
place
and
on
it
instead
of
rows
of
or
even
of
there
was
a
cow
not
a
persian
cow
either
nor
most
fortunately
a
if
there
is
such
a
thing
but
a
smooth
sleek
jersey
cow
who
blinked
large
soft
eyes
at
the
and
mooed
in
an
amiable
if
rather
inquiring
manner
anthea
had
always
been
afraid
of
cows
but
now
she
tried
to
be
brave
anyway
it
can
t
run
after
me
she
said
to
herself
there
isn
t
room
for
it
even
to
begin
to
the
cow
was
perfectly
placid
she
behaved
like
a
strayed
duchess
till
some
one
brought
a
saucer
for
the
milk
and
some
one
else
tried
to
milk
the
cow
into
it
milking
is
very
difficult
you
may
think
it
is
easy
but
it
is
not
all
the
children
were
by
this
time
strung
up
to
a
pitch
of
heroism
that
would
have
been
impossible
to
them
in
their
ordinary
condition
robert
and
cyril
held
the
cow
by
the
horns
and
jane
when
she
was
quite
sure
that
their
end
of
the
cow
was
quite
secure
consented
to
stand
by
ready
to
hold
the
cow
by
the
tail
should
occasion
arise
anthea
holding
the
saucer
now
advanced
towards
the
cow
she
remembered
to
have
heard
that
cows
when
milked
by
strangers
are
susceptible
to
the
soothing
influence
of
the
human
voice
so
clutching
her
saucer
very
tight
she
sought
for
words
to
whose
soothing
influence
the
cow
might
be
susceptible
and
her
memory
troubled
by
the
events
of
the
night
which
seemed
to
go
on
and
on
for
ever
and
ever
refused
to
help
her
with
any
form
of
words
suitable
to
address
a
jersey
cow
in
poor
pussy
then
lie
down
then
good
dog
lie
down
was
all
that
she
could
think
of
to
say
and
she
said
it
and
nobody
laughed
the
situation
full
of
grey
mewing
cats
was
too
serious
for
that
then
anthea
with
a
beating
heart
tried
to
milk
the
cow
next
moment
the
cow
had
knocked
the
saucer
out
of
her
hand
and
trampled
on
it
with
one
foot
while
with
the
other
three
she
had
walked
on
a
foot
each
of
robert
cyril
and
jane
jane
burst
into
tears
oh
how
much
too
horrid
everything
is
she
cried
come
away
let
s
go
to
bed
and
leave
the
horrid
cats
with
the
hateful
cow
perhaps
somebody
will
eat
somebody
else
and
serve
them
they
did
not
go
to
bed
but
they
had
a
shivering
council
in
the
which
smelt
of
soot
and
indeed
a
heap
of
this
lay
in
the
fender
there
had
been
no
fire
in
the
room
since
mother
went
away
and
all
the
chairs
and
tables
were
in
the
wrong
places
and
the
chrysanthemums
were
dead
and
the
water
in
the
pot
nearly
dried
up
anthea
wrapped
the
embroidered
woolly
sofa
blanket
round
jane
and
herself
while
robert
and
cyril
had
a
struggle
silent
and
brief
but
fierce
for
the
larger
share
of
the
fur
hearthrug
it
is
most
truly
awful
said
anthea
and
i
am
so
tired
let
s
let
the
cats
and
the
cow
perhaps
said
cyril
the
police
would
find
us
at
once
that
cow
would
stand
at
the
gate
and
mew
i
mean
moo
to
come
in
and
so
would
the
cats
no
i
see
quite
well
what
we
ve
got
to
do
we
must
put
them
in
baskets
and
leave
them
on
people
s
doorsteps
like
orphan
we
ve
got
three
baskets
counting
mother
s
work
one
said
jane
brightening
and
there
are
nearly
two
hundred
cats
said
anthea
besides
the
cow
and
it
would
have
to
be
a
basket
for
her
and
then
i
don
t
know
how
you
d
carry
it
and
you
d
never
find
a
doorstep
big
enough
to
put
it
on
except
the
church
one
and
oh
well
said
cyril
if
you
simply
make
difficulties
i
m
with
you
said
robert
don
t
fuss
about
the
cow
panther
it
s
simply
got
to
stay
the
night
and
i
m
sure
i
ve
read
that
the
cow
is
a
remunerating
creature
and
that
means
it
will
sit
still
and
think
for
hours
the
carpet
can
take
it
away
in
the
morning
and
as
for
the
baskets
we
ll
do
them
up
in
dusters
or
or
come
on
squirrel
you
girls
can
be
out
of
it
if
you
his
tone
was
full
of
contempt
but
jane
and
anthea
were
too
tired
and
desperate
to
care
even
being
out
of
it
which
at
other
times
they
could
not
have
borne
now
seemed
quite
a
comfort
they
snuggled
down
in
the
sofa
blanket
and
cyril
threw
the
fur
hearthrug
over
them
ah
he
said
that
s
all
women
are
fit
for
to
keep
safe
and
warm
while
the
men
do
the
work
and
run
dangers
and
risks
and
i
m
not
said
anthea
you
know
i
m
but
cyril
was
gone
it
was
warm
under
the
blanket
and
the
hearthrug
and
jane
snuggled
up
close
to
her
sister
and
anthea
cuddled
jane
closely
and
kindly
and
in
a
sort
of
dream
they
heard
the
rise
of
a
wave
of
mewing
as
robert
opened
the
door
of
the
nursery
they
heard
the
booted
search
for
baskets
in
the
back
kitchen
they
heard
the
side
door
open
and
close
and
they
knew
that
each
brother
had
gone
out
with
at
least
one
cat
anthea
s
last
thought
was
that
it
would
take
at
least
all
night
to
get
rid
of
one
hundred
and
cats
by
twos
there
would
be
journeys
of
two
cats
each
and
one
cat
over
i
almost
think
we
might
keep
the
one
cat
over
said
anthea
i
don
t
seem
to
care
for
cats
just
now
but
i
daresay
i
shall
again
some
and
she
fell
asleep
jane
also
was
sleeping
it
was
jane
who
awoke
with
a
start
to
find
anthea
still
asleep
as
in
the
act
of
awakening
she
kicked
her
sister
she
wondered
idly
why
they
should
have
gone
to
bed
in
their
boots
but
the
next
moment
she
remembered
where
they
were
there
was
a
sound
of
muffled
shuffled
feet
on
the
stairs
like
the
heroine
of
the
classic
poem
jane
thought
it
was
the
boys
and
as
she
felt
quite
wide
awake
and
not
nearly
so
tired
as
before
she
crept
gently
from
anthea
s
side
and
followed
the
footsteps
they
went
down
into
the
basement
the
cats
who
seemed
to
have
fallen
into
the
sleep
of
exhaustion
awoke
at
the
sound
of
the
approaching
footsteps
and
mewed
piteously
jane
was
at
the
foot
of
the
stairs
before
she
saw
it
was
not
her
brothers
whose
coming
had
roused
her
and
the
cats
but
a
burglar
she
knew
he
was
a
burglar
at
once
because
he
wore
a
fur
cap
and
a
red
and
black
comforter
and
he
had
no
business
where
he
was
if
you
had
been
stood
in
jane
s
shoes
you
would
no
doubt
have
run
away
in
them
appealing
to
the
police
and
neighbours
with
horrid
screams
but
jane
knew
better
she
had
read
a
great
many
nice
stories
about
burglars
as
well
as
some
affecting
pieces
of
poetry
and
she
knew
that
no
burglar
will
ever
hurt
a
little
girl
if
he
meets
her
when
burgling
indeed
in
all
the
cases
jane
had
read
of
his
burglarishness
was
almost
at
once
forgotten
in
the
interest
he
felt
in
the
little
girl
s
artless
prattle
so
if
jane
hesitated
for
a
moment
before
addressing
the
burglar
it
was
only
because
she
could
not
at
once
think
of
any
remark
sufficiently
prattling
and
artless
to
make
a
beginning
with
in
the
stories
and
the
affecting
poetry
the
child
could
never
speak
plainly
though
it
always
looked
old
enough
to
in
the
pictures
and
jane
could
not
make
up
her
mind
to
lisp
and
talk
baby
even
to
a
burglar
and
while
she
hesitated
he
softly
opened
the
nursery
door
and
went
in
jane
followed
just
in
time
to
see
him
sit
down
flat
on
the
floor
scattering
cats
as
a
stone
thrown
into
a
pool
splashes
water
she
closed
the
door
softly
and
stood
there
still
wondering
whether
she
could
bring
herself
to
say
what
s
oo
doing
here
mithter
wobber
and
whether
any
other
kind
of
talk
would
do
then
she
heard
the
burglar
draw
a
long
breath
and
he
spoke
it
s
a
judgement
he
said
so
help
me
bob
if
it
ain
t
oh
ere
s
a
thing
to
appen
to
a
chap
makes
it
come
ome
to
you
don
t
it
neither
cats
an
cats
an
cats
there
couldn
t
be
all
them
cats
let
alone
the
cow
if
she
ain
t
the
moral
of
the
old
man
s
daisy
she
s
a
dream
out
of
when
i
was
a
lad
i
don
t
mind
er
so
much
ere
daisy
daisy
the
cow
turned
and
looked
at
him
she
s
all
right
he
went
on
sort
of
company
too
though
them
above
knows
how
she
got
into
this
downstairs
parlour
but
them
cats
oh
take
em
away
take
em
away
i
ll
chuck
the
ole
show
oh
take
em
burglar
said
jane
close
behind
him
and
he
started
convulsively
and
turned
on
her
a
blank
face
whose
pale
lips
trembled
i
can
t
take
those
cats
lor
lumme
exclaimed
the
man
if
ere
ain
t
another
on
em
are
you
real
miss
or
something
i
ll
wake
up
from
presently
i
am
quite
real
said
jane
relieved
to
find
that
a
lisp
was
not
needed
to
make
the
burglar
understand
her
and
so
she
added
are
the
then
send
for
the
police
send
for
the
police
and
i
ll
go
quiet
if
you
ain
t
no
realler
than
them
cats
i
m
done
spunchuck
out
of
time
send
for
the
police
i
ll
go
quiet
one
thing
there
d
not
be
room
for
arf
them
cats
in
no
cell
as
ever
he
ran
his
fingers
through
his
hair
which
was
short
and
his
eyes
wandered
wildly
round
the
roomful
of
cats
burglar
said
jane
kindly
and
softly
if
you
didn
t
like
cats
what
did
you
come
here
for
send
for
the
police
was
the
unfortunate
criminal
s
only
reply
i
d
rather
you
would
honest
i
d
i
daren
t
said
jane
and
besides
i
ve
no
one
to
send
i
hate
the
police
i
wish
he
d
never
been
you
ve
a
feeling
art
miss
said
the
burglar
but
them
cats
is
really
a
little
bit
too
look
here
said
jane
i
won
t
call
the
police
and
i
am
quite
a
real
little
girl
though
i
talk
older
than
the
kind
you
ve
met
before
when
you
ve
been
doing
your
burglings
and
they
are
real
cats
and
they
want
real
milk
and
didn
t
you
say
the
cow
was
like
somebody
s
daisy
that
you
used
to
know
wish
i
may
die
if
she
ain
t
the
very
spit
of
her
replied
the
man
well
then
said
jane
and
a
thrill
of
joyful
pride
ran
through
her
perhaps
you
know
how
to
milk
cows
perhaps
i
does
was
the
burglar
s
cautious
rejoinder
then
said
jane
if
you
will
only
milk
ours
you
don
t
know
how
we
shall
always
love
the
burglar
replied
that
loving
was
all
very
well
if
those
cats
only
had
a
good
long
wet
thirsty
drink
of
milk
jane
went
on
with
eager
persuasion
they
d
lie
down
and
go
to
sleep
as
likely
as
not
and
then
the
police
won
t
come
back
but
if
they
go
on
mewing
like
this
he
will
and
then
i
don
t
know
what
ll
become
of
us
or
you
this
argument
seemed
to
decide
the
criminal
jane
fetched
the
from
the
sink
and
he
spat
on
his
hands
and
prepared
to
milk
the
cow
at
this
instant
boots
were
heard
on
the
stairs
it
s
all
up
said
the
man
desperately
this
ere
s
a
plant
ere
s
the
he
made
as
if
to
open
the
window
and
leap
from
it
it
s
all
right
i
tell
you
whispered
jane
in
anguish
i
ll
say
you
re
a
friend
of
mine
or
the
good
clergyman
called
in
or
my
uncle
or
anything
only
do
do
do
milk
the
cow
oh
don
t
go
oh
oh
thank
goodness
it
s
only
the
boys
it
was
and
their
entrance
had
awakened
anthea
who
with
her
brothers
now
crowded
through
the
doorway
the
man
looked
about
him
like
a
rat
looks
round
a
trap
this
is
a
friend
of
mine
said
jane
he
s
just
called
in
and
he
s
going
to
milk
the
cow
for
us
isn
t
it
good
and
kind
of
him
she
winked
at
the
others
and
though
they
did
not
understand
they
played
up
loyally
how
do
said
cyril
very
glad
to
meet
you
don
t
let
us
interrupt
the
i
shall
ave
a
ead
and
a
arf
in
the
morning
and
no
bloomin
error
remarked
the
burglar
but
he
began
to
milk
the
cow
robert
was
winked
at
to
stay
and
see
that
he
did
not
leave
off
milking
or
try
to
escape
and
the
others
went
to
get
things
to
put
the
milk
in
for
it
was
now
spurting
and
foaming
in
the
and
the
cats
had
ceased
from
mewing
and
were
crowding
round
the
cow
with
expressions
of
hope
and
anticipation
on
their
whiskered
faces
we
can
t
get
rid
of
any
more
cats
said
cyril
as
he
and
his
sisters
piled
a
tray
high
with
saucers
and
and
platters
and
the
police
nearly
got
us
as
it
was
not
the
same
one
a
much
stronger
sort
he
thought
it
really
was
a
foundling
orphan
we
d
got
if
it
hadn
t
been
for
me
throwing
the
two
bags
of
cat
slap
in
his
eye
and
hauling
robert
over
a
railing
and
lying
like
mice
under
a
well
it
s
jolly
lucky
i
m
a
good
shot
that
s
all
he
pranced
off
when
he
d
got
the
off
his
face
thought
we
d
bolted
and
here
we
the
gentle
samishness
of
the
milk
swishing
into
the
seemed
to
have
soothed
the
burglar
very
much
he
went
on
milking
in
a
sort
of
happy
dream
while
the
children
got
a
cap
and
ladled
the
warm
milk
out
into
the
and
plates
and
platters
and
saucers
and
set
them
down
to
the
music
of
persian
purrs
and
lappings
it
makes
me
think
of
old
times
said
the
burglar
smearing
his
ragged
across
his
eyes
about
the
apples
in
the
orchard
at
home
and
the
rats
at
threshing
time
and
the
rabbits
and
the
ferrets
and
how
pretty
it
was
seeing
the
pigs
finding
him
in
this
softened
mood
jane
said
i
wish
you
d
tell
us
how
you
came
to
choose
our
house
for
your
burglaring
i
am
awfully
glad
you
did
you
have
been
so
kind
i
don
t
know
what
we
should
have
done
without
you
she
added
hastily
we
all
love
you
ever
so
do
tell
the
others
added
their
affectionate
entreaties
and
at
last
the
burglar
said
well
it
s
my
first
job
and
i
didn
t
expect
to
be
made
so
welcome
and
that
s
the
truth
young
gents
and
ladies
and
i
don
t
know
but
what
it
won
t
be
my
last

with
deep
feeling
you
don
t
know
her
temper
when
she

roused
an
i
m
sure
i
ope
you
never
may
neither
and
i
d
ad
all
my
oranges
off
of

so
it
came
back
to
me
what

wrote
on
the
ongverlope
and
i
says
to

anthea
we

they

awful
bother
if

sacks
or
baskets

brother
s
missus
would
be
awfully
pleased
my
father
says
persian
cats

said
the
burglar
and
he
was
certainly
moved
by
her
remarks
i

re
in
a
hole
and
i
don
t
mind
lending
a
helping
and
i

them
but

got
a
pal

s
a
mark
on

if
he
thinks
they
d
fetch
anything
above
their
skins
i
don
t
mind
doin
you
a
you
won
t
go
away
and
never
come
back
said
jane
because
i
don
t
think
i
could
bear
the
burglar
quite
touched
by
her
emotion
swore
sentimentally
that
alive
or
dead
he
would
come
back
then
he
went
and
cyril
and
robert
sent
the
girls
to
bed
and
sat
up
to
wait
for
his
return
it
soon
seemed
absurd
to
await
him
in
a
state
of
wakefulness
but
his
stealthy
tap
on
the
window
awoke
them
readily
enough
for
he
did
return
with
the
pal
and
the
barrow
and
the
sacks
the
pal
approved
of
the
cats
now
dormant
in
persian
repletion
and
they
were
bundled
into
the
sacks
and
taken
away
on
the
barrow
mewing
indeed
but
with
mews
too
sleepy
to
attract
public
attention
i
m
a
fence
that
s
what
i
am
said
the
burglar
gloomily
i
never
thought
i
d
come
down
to
this
and
all
acause
er
my
kind
cyril
knew
that
a
fence
is
a
receiver
of
stolen
goods
and
he
replied
briskly
i
give
you
my
sacred
the
cats
aren
t
stolen
what
do
you
make
the
time
i
ain
t
got
the
time
on
me
said
the
pal
but
it
was
just
about
time
as
i
come
by
the
bull
and
gate
i
shouldn
t
wonder
if
it
was
nigh
upon
one
when
the
cats
had
been
removed
and
the
boys
and
the
burglar
had
parted
with
warm
expressions
of
friendship
there
remained
only
the
cow
she
must
stay
all
night
said
robert
cook
ll
have
a
fit
when
she
sees
all
night
said
cyril
why
it
s
tomorrow
morning
if
it
s
one
we
can
have
another
wish
so
the
carpet
was
urged
in
a
hastily
written
note
to
remove
the
cow
to
wherever
she
belonged
and
to
return
to
its
proper
place
on
the
nursery
floor
but
the
cow
could
not
be
got
to
move
on
to
the
carpet
so
robert
got
the
clothes
line
out
of
the
back
kitchen
and
tied
one
end
very
firmly
to
the
cow
s
horns
and
the
other
end
to
a
corner
of
the
carpet
and
said
fire
and
the
carpet
and
cow
vanished
together
and
the
boys
went
to
bed
tired
out
and
only
too
thankful
that
the
evening
at
last
was
over
next
morning
the
carpet
lay
calmly
in
its
place
but
one
corner
was
very
badly
torn
it
was
the
corner
that
the
cow
had
been
tied
on
to
chapter
the
burglar
s
bride
the
morning
after
the
adventure
of
the
persian
cats
the
the
common
cow
and
the
uncommon
burglar
all
the
children
slept
till
it
was
ten
o
clock
and
then
it
was
only
cyril
who
woke
but
he
attended
to
the
others
so
that
by
half
past
ten
every
one
was
ready
to
help
to
get
breakfast
it
was
shivery
cold
and
there
was
but
little
in
the
house
that
was
really
worth
eating
robert
had
arranged
a
thoughtful
little
surprise
for
the
absent
servants
he
had
made
a
neat
and
delightful
booby
trap
over
the
kitchen
door
and
as
soon
as
they
heard
the
front
door
click
open
and
knew
the
servants
had
come
back
all
four
children
hid
in
the
cupboard
under
the
stairs
and
listened
with
delight
to
the
entrance
the
tumble
the
splash
the
scuffle
and
the
remarks
of
the
servants
they
heard
the
cook
say
it
was
a
judgement
on
them
for
leaving
the
place
to
itself
she
seemed
to
think
that
a
booby
trap
was
a
kind
of
plant
that
was
quite
likely
to
grow
all
by
itself
in
a
dwelling
that
was
left
shut
up
but
the
housemaid
more
acute
judged
that
someone
must
have
been
in
the
house
a
view
confirmed
by
the
sight
of
the
breakfast
things
on
the
nursery
table
the
cupboard
under
the
stairs
was
very
tight
and
paraffiny
however
and
a
silent
struggle
for
a
place
on
top
ended
in
the
door
bursting
open
and
discharging
jane
who
rolled
like
a
football
to
the
feet
of
the
servants
now
said
cyril
firmly
when
the
cook
s
hysterics
had
become
quieter
and
the
housemaid
had
time
to
say
what
she
thought
of
them
don
t
you
begin
jawing
us
we
aren
t
going
to
stand
it
we
know
too
much
you
ll
please
make
an
extra
special
treacle
roley
for
dinner
and
we
ll
have
a
tinned
i
daresay
said
the
housemaid
indignant
still
in
her
outdoor
things
and
with
her
hat
very
much
on
one
side
don
t
you
come
me
master
cyril
because
i
won
t
stand
it
so
i
tell
you
you
tell
your
ma
about
us
being
out
much
i
care
she
ll
be
sorry
for
me
when
she
hears
about
my
dear
by
marriage
as
brought
me
up
from
a
child
and
was
a
mother
to
me
she
sent
for
me
she
did
she
wasn
t
expected
to
last
the
night
from
the
spasms
going
to
her
legs
and
cook
was
that
kind
and
careful
she
couldn
t
let
me
go
alone
so
don
t
said
anthea
in
real
distress
you
know
where
liars
go
to
eliza
at
least
if
you
don
t
liars
indeed
said
eliza
i
won
t
demean
myself
talking
to
how
s
mrs
wigson
said
robert
and
did
you
keep
it
up
last
night
the
mouth
of
the
housemaid
fell
open
did
you
doss
with
maria
or
emily
asked
cyril
how
did
mrs
prosser
enjoy
herself
asked
jane
forbear
said
cyril
they
ve
had
enough
whether
we
tell
or
not
depends
on
your
later
life
he
went
on
addressing
the
servants
if
you
are
decent
to
us
we
ll
be
decent
to
you
you
d
better
make
that
treacle
roley
and
if
i
were
you
eliza
i
d
do
a
little
housework
and
cleaning
just
for
a
the
servants
gave
in
once
and
for
all
there
s
nothing
like
firmness
cyril
went
on
when
the
breakfast
things
were
cleared
away
and
the
children
were
alone
in
the
nursery
people
are
always
talking
of
difficulties
with
servants
it
s
quite
simple
when
you
know
the
way
we
can
do
what
we
like
now
and
they
won
t
peach
i
think
we
ve
broken
their
proud
spirit
let
s
go
somewhere
by
i
wouldn
t
if
i
were
you
said
the
phoenix
yawning
as
it
swooped
down
from
its
roost
on
the
curtain
pole
i
ve
given
you
one
or
two
hints
but
now
concealment
is
at
an
end
and
i
see
i
must
speak
it
perched
on
the
back
of
a
chair
and
swayed
to
and
fro
like
a
parrot
on
a
swing
what
s
the
matter
now
said
anthea
she
was
not
quite
so
gentle
as
usual
because
she
was
still
weary
from
the
excitement
of
last
night
s
cats
i
m
tired
of
things
happening
i
shan
t
go
anywhere
on
the
carpet
i
m
going
to
darn
my
darn
said
the
phoenix
darn
from
those
young
lips
these
strange
expressions
mend
then
said
anthea
with
a
needle
and
the
phoenix
opened
and
shut
its
wings
thoughtfully
your
stockings
it
said
are
much
less
important
than
they
now
appear
to
you
but
the
carpet
look
at
the
bare
worn
patches
look
at
the
great
rent
at
yonder
corner
the
carpet
has
been
your
faithful
friend
your
willing
servant
how
have
you
requited
its
devoted
service
dear
phoenix
anthea
urged
don
t
talk
in
that
horrid
lecturing
tone
you
make
me
feel
as
if
i
d
done
something
wrong
and
really
it
is
a
wishing
carpet
and
we
haven
t
done
anything
else
to
it
only
only
wishes
repeated
the
phoenix
ruffling
its
neck
feathers
angrily
and
what
sort
of
wishes
wishing
people
to
be
in
a
good
temper
for
instance
what
carpet
did
you
ever
hear
of
that
had
such
a
wish
asked
of
it
but
this
noble
fabric
on
which
you
trample
so
recklessly
every
one
removed
its
boots
from
the
carpet
and
stood
on
the
linoleum
this
carpet
never
flinched
it
did
what
you
asked
but
the
wear
and
tear
must
have
been
awful
and
then
last
night
i
don
t
blame
you
about
the
cats
and
the
rats
for
those
were
its
own
choice
but
what
carpet
could
stand
a
heavy
cow
hanging
on
to
it
at
one
corner
i
should
think
the
cats
and
rats
were
worse
said
robert
look
at
all
their
yes
said
the
bird
eleven
thousand
nine
hundred
and
forty
of
them
i
daresay
you
noticed
i
should
be
surprised
if
these
had
not
left
their
good
gracious
said
jane
sitting
down
suddenly
on
the
floor
and
patting
the
edge
of
the
carpet
softly
do
you
mean
it
s
wearing
out
its
life
with
you
has
not
been
a
luxurious
one
said
the
phoenix
french
mud
twice
sand
of
sunny
shores
twice
soaking
in
southern
seas
once
india
once
goodness
knows
where
in
persia
once
once
and
once
wherever
the
cow
came
from
hold
your
carpet
up
to
the
light
and
with
cautious
tenderness
if
you
with
cautious
tenderness
the
boys
held
the
carpet
up
to
the
light
the
girls
looked
and
a
shiver
of
regret
ran
through
them
as
they
saw
how
those
eleven
thoousand
nine
hundred
and
forty
claws
had
run
through
the
carpet
it
was
full
of
little
holes
there
were
some
large
ones
and
more
than
one
thin
place
at
one
corner
a
strip
of
it
was
torn
and
hung
forlornly
we
must
mend
it
said
anthea
never
mind
about
my
stockings
i
can
sew
them
up
in
lumps
with
sewing
cotton
if
there
s
no
time
to
do
them
properly
i
know
it
s
awful
and
no
girl
would
who
respected
herself
and
all
that
but
the
poor
dear
carpet
s
more
important
than
my
silly
stockings
let
s
go
out
now
this
very
so
out
they
all
went
and
bought
wool
to
mend
the
carpet
but
there
is
no
shop
in
camden
town
where
you
can
buy
no
nor
in
kentish
town
either
however
ordinary
scotch
fingering
seemed
good
enough
and
this
they
bought
and
all
that
day
jane
and
anthea
darned
and
darned
and
darned
the
boys
went
out
for
a
walk
in
the
afternoon
and
the
gentle
phoenix
paced
up
and
down
the
table
for
exercise
as
it
said
and
talked
to
the
industrious
girls
about
their
carpet
it
is
not
an
ordinary
ignorant
innocent
carpet
from
kidderminster
it
said
it
is
a
carpet
with
a
past
a
persian
past
do
you
know
that
in
happier
years
when
that
carpet
was
the
property
of
caliphs
viziers
kings
and
sultans
it
never
lay
on
a
floor
i
thought
the
floor
was
the
proper
home
of
a
carpet
jane
interrupted
not
of
a
magic
carpet
said
the
phoenix
why
if
it
had
been
allowed
to
lie
about
on
floors
there
wouldn
t
be
much
of
it
left
now
no
indeed
it
has
lived
in
chests
of
cedarwood
inlaid
with
pearl
and
ivory
wrapped
in
priceless
tissues
of
cloth
of
gold
embroidered
with
gems
of
fabulous
value
it
has
reposed
in
the
caskets
of
princesses
and
in
the
of
kings
never
never
had
any
one
degraded
it
by
walking
on
it
except
in
the
way
of
business
when
wishes
were
required
and
then
they
always
took
their
shoes
off
and
you
oh
don
t
said
jane
very
near
tears
you
know
you
d
never
have
been
hatched
at
all
if
it
hadn
t
been
for
mother
wanting
a
carpet
for
us
to
walk
you
needn
t
have
walked
so
much
or
so
hard
said
the
bird
but
come
dry
that
crystal
tear
and
i
will
relate
to
you
the
story
of
the
princess
zulieka
the
prince
of
asia
and
the
magic
relate
away
said
anthea
i
mean
please
the
princess
zulieka
fairest
of
royal
ladies
began
the
bird
had
in
her
cradle
been
the
subject
of
several
enchantments
her
grandmother
had
been
in
her
day
but
what
in
her
day
zulieka
s
grandmother
had
been
was
destined
never
to
be
revealed
for
cyril
and
robert
suddenly
burst
into
the
room
and
on
each
brow
were
the
traces
of
deep
emotion
on
cyril
s
pale
brow
stood
beads
of
agitation
and
perspiration
and
on
the
scarlet
brow
of
robert
was
a
large
black
smear
what
ails
ye
both
asked
the
phoenix
and
it
added
tartly
that
was
quite
impossible
if
people
would
come
interrupting
like
that
oh
do
shut
up
for
any
sake
said
cyril
sinking
into
a
chair
robert
smoothed
the
ruffled
golden
feathers
adding
kindly
squirrel
doesn
t
mean
to
be
a
beast
it
s
only
that
the
most
awful
thing
has
happened
and
stories
don
t
seem
to
matter
so
much
don
t
be
cross
you
won
t
be
when
you
ve
heard
what
s
well
what
has
happened
said
the
bird
still
rather
crossly
and
anthea
and
jane
paused
with
long
needles
poised
in
air
and
long
needlefuls
of
scotch
fingering
wool
drooping
from
them
the
most
awful
thing
you
can
possibly
think
of
said
cyril
that
nice
chap
our
own
burglar
the
police
have
got
him
on
suspicion
of
stolen
cats
that
s
what
his
brother
s
missis
told
oh
begin
at
the
beginning
cried
anthea
impatiently
well
then
we
went
out
and
down
by
where
the
undertaker
s
is
with
the
china
flowers
in
the
window
you
know
there
was
a
crowd
and
of
course
we
went
to
have
a
squint
and
it
was
two
bobbies
and
our
burglar
between
them
and
he
was
being
dragged
along
and
he
said
i
tell
you
them
cats
was
give
me
i
got
em
in
exchange
for
me
milking
a
cow
in
a
basement
parlour
up
camden
town
and
the
people
laughed
beasts
and
then
one
of
the
policemen
said
perhaps
he
could
give
the
name
and
address
of
the
cow
and
he
said
no
he
couldn
t
but
he
could
take
them
there
if
they
d
only
leave
go
of
his
coat
collar
and
give
him
a
chance
to
get
his
breath
and
the
policeman
said
he
could
tell
all
that
to
the
magistrate
in
the
morning
he
didn
t
see
us
and
so
we
came
oh
cyril
how
could
you
said
anthea
don
t
be
a
cyril
advised
a
fat
lot
of
good
it
would
have
done
if
we
d
let
him
see
us
no
one
would
have
believed
a
word
we
said
they
d
have
thought
we
were
kidding
we
did
better
than
let
him
see
us
we
asked
a
boy
where
he
lived
and
he
told
us
and
we
went
there
and
it
s
a
little
greengrocer
s
shop
and
we
bought
some
brazil
nuts
here
they
the
girls
waved
away
the
brazil
nuts
with
loathing
and
contempt
well
we
had
to
buy
something
and
while
we
were
making
up
our
minds
what
to
buy
we
heard
his
brother
s
missis
talking
she
said
when
he
came
home
with
all
them
miaoulers
she
thought
there
was
more
in
it
than
met
the
eye
but
he
would
go
out
this
morning
with
the
two
likeliest
of
them
one
under
each
arm
she
said
he
sent
her
out
to
buy
blue
ribbon
to
put
round
their
beastly
necks
and
she
said
if
he
got
three
months
hard
it
was
her
dying
word
that
he
d
got
the
blue
ribbon
to
thank
for
it
that
and
his
own
silly
thieving
ways
taking
cats
that
anybody
would
know
he
couldn
t
have
come
by
in
the
way
of
business
instead
of
things
that
wouldn
t
have
been
missed
which
lord
knows
there
are
plenty
such
and
oh
stop
cried
jane
and
indeed
it
was
time
for
cyril
seemed
like
a
clock
that
had
been
wound
up
and
could
not
help
going
on
where
is
he
now
at
the
said
robert
for
cyril
was
out
of
breath
the
boy
told
us
they
d
put
him
in
the
cells
and
would
bring
him
up
before
the
beak
in
the
morning
i
thought
it
was
a
jolly
lark
last
night
getting
him
to
take
the
cats
but
now
the
end
of
a
lark
said
the
phoenix
is
the
let
s
go
to
him
cried
both
the
girls
jumping
up
let
s
go
and
tell
the
truth
they
must
believe
they
can
t
said
cyril
just
think
if
any
one
came
to
you
with
such
a
tale
you
couldn
t
believe
it
however
much
you
tried
we
should
only
mix
things
up
worse
for
there
must
be
something
we
could
do
said
jane
sniffing
very
much
my
own
dear
pet
burglar
i
can
t
bear
it
and
he
was
so
nice
the
way
he
talked
about
his
father
and
how
he
was
going
to
be
so
extra
honest
dear
phoenix
you
must
be
able
to
help
us
you
re
so
good
and
kind
and
pretty
and
clever
do
do
tell
us
what
to
the
phoenix
rubbed
its
beak
thoughtfully
with
its
claw
you
might
rescue
him
it
said
and
conceal
him
here
till
the
had
forgotten
about
that
would
be
ages
and
ages
said
cyril
and
we
couldn
t
conceal
him
here
father
might
come
home
at
any
moment
and
if
he
found
the
burglar
here
he
wouldn
t
believe
the
true
truth
any
more
than
the
police
would
that
s
the
worst
of
the
truth
nobody
ever
believes
it
couldn
t
we
take
him
somewhere
else
jane
clapped
her
hands
the
sunny
southern
shore
she
cried
where
the
cook
is
being
queen
he
and
she
would
be
company
for
each
other
and
really
the
idea
did
not
seem
bad
if
only
he
would
consent
to
go
so
all
talking
at
once
the
children
arranged
to
wait
till
evening
and
then
to
seek
the
dear
burglar
in
his
lonely
cell
meantime
jane
and
anthea
darned
away
as
hard
as
they
could
to
make
the
carpet
as
strong
as
possible
for
all
felt
how
terrible
it
would
be
if
the
precious
burglar
while
being
carried
to
the
sunny
southern
shore
were
to
tumble
through
a
hole
in
the
carpet
and
be
lost
for
ever
in
the
sunny
southern
sea
the
servants
were
tired
after
mrs
wigson
s
party
so
every
one
went
to
bed
early
and
when
the
phoenix
reported
that
both
servants
were
snoring
in
a
heartfelt
and
candid
manner
the
children
got
up
they
had
never
undressed
just
putting
their
nightgowns
on
over
their
things
had
been
enough
to
deceive
eliza
when
she
came
to
turn
out
the
gas
so
they
were
ready
for
anything
and
they
stood
on
the
carpet
and
said
i
wish
we
were
in
our
burglar
s
lonely
and
instantly
they
were
i
think
every
one
had
expected
the
cell
to
be
the
deepest
dungeon
below
the
castle
moat
i
am
sure
no
one
had
doubted
that
the
burglar
chained
by
heavy
fetters
to
a
ring
in
the
damp
stone
wall
would
be
tossing
uneasily
on
a
bed
of
straw
with
a
pitcher
of
water
and
a
mouldering
crust
untasted
beside
him
robert
remembering
the
underground
passage
and
the
treasure
had
brought
a
candle
and
matches
but
these
were
not
needed
the
cell
was
a
little
room
about
twelve
feet
long
and
six
feet
wide
on
one
side
of
it
was
a
sort
of
shelf
sloping
a
little
towards
the
wall
on
this
were
two
rugs
striped
blue
and
yellow
and
a
pillow
rolled
in
the
rugs
and
with
his
head
on
the
pillow
lay
the
burglar
fast
asleep
he
had
had
his
tea
though
this
the
children
did
not
know
it
had
come
from
the
round
the
corner
in
very
thick
crockery
the
scene
was
plainly
revealed
by
the
light
of
a
in
the
passage
outside
which
shone
into
the
cell
through
a
pane
of
thick
glass
over
the
door
i
shall
gag
him
said
cyril
and
robert
will
hold
him
down
anthea
and
jane
and
the
phoenix
can
whisper
soft
nothings
to
him
while
he
gradually
this
plan
did
not
have
the
success
it
deserved
because
the
burglar
curiously
enough
was
much
stronger
even
in
his
sleep
than
robert
and
cyril
and
at
the
first
touch
of
their
hands
he
leapt
up
and
shouted
out
something
very
loud
indeed
instantly
steps
were
heard
outside
anthea
threw
her
arms
round
the
burglar
and
whispered
it
s
us
the
ones
that
gave
you
the
cats
we
ve
come
to
save
you
only
don
t
let
on
we
re
here
can
t
we
hide
somewhere
heavy
boots
sounded
on
the
flagged
passage
outside
and
a
firm
voice
shouted
here
you
stop
that
row
will
you
all
right
governor
replied
the
burglar
still
with
anthea
s
arms
round
him
i
was
only
in
my
sleep
no
it
was
an
awful
moment
would
the
boots
and
the
voice
come
in
yes
no
the
voice
said
well
stow
it
will
you
and
the
boots
went
heavily
away
along
the
passage
and
up
some
sounding
stone
stairs
now
then
whispered
anthea
how
the
blue
moses
did
you
get
in
asked
the
burglar
in
a
hoarse
whisper
of
amazement
on
the
carpet
said
jane
truly
stow
that
said
the
burglar
one
on
you
i
could
a
swallowed
but
four
and
a
yellow
look
here
said
cyril
sternly
you
wouldn
t
have
believed
any
one
if
they
d
told
you
beforehand
about
your
finding
a
cow
and
all
those
cats
in
our
that
i
wouldn
t
said
the
burglar
with
whispered
fervour
so
help
me
bob
i
wouldn
well
then
cyril
went
on
ignoring
this
appeal
to
his
brother
just
try
to
believe
what
we
tell
you
and
act
accordingly
it
can
t
do
you
any
harm
you
know
he
went
on
in
hoarse
whispered
earnestness
you
can
t
be
very
much
worse
off
than
you
are
now
you
know
but
if
you
ll
just
trust
to
us
we
ll
get
you
out
of
this
right
enough
no
one
saw
us
come
in
the
question
is
where
would
you
like
to
go
i
d
like
to
go
to
boolong
was
the
instant
reply
of
the
burglar
i
ve
always
wanted
to
go
on
that
there
trip
but
i
ve
never
ad
the
ready
at
the
right
time
of
the
boolong
is
a
town
like
london
said
cyril
well
meaning
but
inaccurate
how
could
you
get
a
living
there
the
burglar
scratched
his
head
in
deep
doubt
it
s
ard
to
get
a
onest
living
anywheres
nowadays
he
said
and
his
voice
was
sad
yes
isn
t
it
said
jane
sympathetically
but
how
about
a
sunny
southern
shore
where
there
s
nothing
to
do
at
all
unless
you
want
that
s
my
billet
miss
replied
the
burglar
i
never
did
care
about
work
not
like
some
people
always
fussing
did
you
never
like
any
sort
of
work
asked
anthea
severely
lor
lumme
yes
he
answered
gardening
was
my
obby
so
it
was
but
father
died
afore
e
could
bind
me
to
a
nurseryman
an
we
ll
take
you
to
the
sunny
southern
shore
said
jane
you
ve
no
idea
what
the
flowers
are
our
old
cook
s
there
said
anthea
she
s
queen
oh
chuck
it
the
burglar
whispered
clutching
at
his
head
with
both
hands
i
knowed
the
first
minute
i
see
them
cats
and
that
cow
as
it
was
a
judgement
on
me
i
don
t
know
now
whether
i
m
on
my
hat
or
my
boots
so
help
me
i
don
t
if
you
can
get
me
out

me
and
if
you
can
t
get
along
with
you
for
goodness
sake
and
give
me
a
chanst
to
think
about
what
ll
be
most
likely
to
go
down
with
the
beak
in
the
come
on
to
the
carpet
then
said
anthea
gently
shoving
the
others
quietly
pulled
and
the
moment
the
feet
of
the
burglar
were
planted
on
the
carpet
anthea
wished
i
wish
we
were
all
on
the
sunny
southern
shore
where
cook
and
instantly
they
were
there
were
the
rainbow
sands
the
tropic
glories
of
leaf
and
flower
and
there
of
course
was
the
cook
crowned
with
white
flowers
and
with
all
the
wrinkles
of
crossness
and
tiredness
and
hard
work
wiped
out
of
her
face
why
cook
you
re
quite
pretty
anthea
said
as
soon
as
she
had
got
her
breath
after
the
of
the
carpet
the
burglar
stood
rubbing
his
eyes
in
the
brilliant
tropic
sunlight
and
gazing
wildly
round
him
on
the
vivid
hues
of
the
tropic
land
penny
plain
and
tuppence
coloured
he
exclaimed
pensively
and
well
worth
any
tuppence
however
the
cook
was
seated
on
a
grassy
mound
with
her
court
of
savages
around
her
the
burglar
pointed
a
grimy
finger
at
these
are
they
tame
he
asked
anxiously
do
they
bite
or
scratch
or
do
anything
to
yer
with
poisoned
arrows
or
oyster
shells
or
that
don
t
you
be

timid

the
cook

an
as

i
ll
say
you
re
the
fellow

the
dream

and
on
seemingly
as
long

reply
but
a

wouldn
t
resist
and
my
shirt
was
only
clean
on
week
before
cyril
and
robert
led
him
to
a
rocky
pool
where
he
bathed
luxuriously
then
in
shirt
and
trousers
he
sat
on
the
sand
and
spoke

cook
or
queen
or
whatever
you

her

with
the
white
bokay
on

the
man
went
on
it
s
a
word
and
a
blow
with
me
i
in
shirt
and
trousers
and
crowned
with
a
scented
flowery
wreath
which
cyril
hastily
wove
as
they
returned
to
the
court
of
the
queen
the
burglar
stood
before
the
cook
and
spoke
look
ere
miss
he
said

ere

whatever

straight
as
i

the
cook
smiled
and
looked
down
bashfully
i
m
a
single
man
what
you
might
call
a
batcheldore
i
m
mild
in
my
abits
which
these
kids

tell

same
and
i
d
like
to

the
pleasure
of

said
the
queen
cook
ow
sudden

said
anthea
why
not
get
married
and
have
done
with
it
i
don
t
mind
if
i
do
said
the
burglar
but
the
cook
said
no
miss
not
me
not
even
in
a
dream
i
don
t
say
anythink
ag
in
the
young
chap
s
looks
but
i
always
swore
i
d
be
married
in
church
if
at
all
and
anyway
i
don
t
believe
these
here
savages
would
know
how
to
keep
a
registering
office
even
if
i
was
to
show
them
no
mister
thanking
you
kindly
if
you
can
t
bring
a
clergyman
into
the
dream
i
ll
live
and
die
like
what
i
will
you
marry
her
if
we
get
a
clergyman
asked
the
anthea
i
m
agreeable
miss
i
m
sure
said
he
pulling
his
wreath
straight
ow
this
ere
bokay
do
tiddle
a
chap
s
ears
to
be
sure
so
very
hurriedly
the
carpet
was
spread
out
and
instructed
to
fetch
a
clergyman
the
instructions
were
written
on
the
inside
of
cyril
s
cap
with
a
piece
of
billiard
chalk
robert
had
got
from
the
marker
at
the
hotel
at
lyndhurst
the
carpet
disappeared
and
more
quickly
than
you
would
have
thought
possible
it
came
back
bearing
on
its
bosom
the
reverend
septimus
blenkinsop
the
reverend
septimus
was
rather
a
nice
young
man
but
very
much
mazed
and
muddled
because
when
he
saw
a
strange
carpet
laid
out
at
his
feet
in
his
own
study
he
naturally
walked
on
it
to
examine
it
more
closely
and
he
happened
to
stand
on
one
of
the
thin
places
that
jane
and
anthea
had
darned
so
that
he
was
half
on
wishing
carpet
and
half
on
plain
scotch
fingering
which
has
no
magic
properties
at
all
the
effect
of
this
was
that
he
was
only
half
there
so
that
the
children
could
just
see
through
him
as
though
he
had
been
a
ghost
and
as
for
him
he
saw
the
sunny
southern
shore
the
cook
and
the
burglar
and
the
children
quite
plainly
but
through
them
all
he
saw
quite
plainly
also
his
study
at
home
with
the
books
and
the
pictures
and
the
marble
clock
that
had
been
presented
to
him
when
he
left
his
last
situation
he
seemed
to
himself
to
be
in
a
sort
of
insane
fit
so
that
it
did
not
matter
what
he
did
and
he
married
the
burglar
to
the
cook
the
cook
said
that
she
would
rather
have
had
a
solider
kind
of
a
clergyman
one
that
you
couldn
t
see
through
so
plain
but
perhaps
this
was
real
enough
for
a
dream
and
of
course
the
clergyman
though
misty
was
really
real
and
able
to
marry
people
and
he
did
when
the
ceremony
was
over
the
clergyman
wandered
about
the
island
collecting
botanical
specimens
for
he
was
a
great
botanist
and
the
ruling
passion
was
strong
even
in
an
insane
fit
there
was
a
splendid
wedding
feast
can
you
fancy
jane
and
anthea
and
robert
and
cyril
dancing
merrily
in
a
ring
with
savages
round
the
happy
couple
the
queen
cook
and
the
burglar
consort
there
were
more
flowers
gathered
and
thrown
than
you
have
ever
even
dreamed
of
and
before
the
children
took
carpet
for
home
the
now
burglar
made
a
speech
ladies
and
gentlemen
he
said
and
savages
of
both
kinds
only
i
know
you
can
t
understand
what
i
m
a
saying
of
but
we
ll
let
that
pass
if
this
is
a
dream
i
m
on
if
it
ain
t
i
m
onner
than
ever
if
it
s
betwixt
and
between
well
i
m
honest
and
i
can
t
say
more
i
don
t
want
no
more

i
don
t

and
there

one
thing
more
you
might
take
away
the
parson
i
don
t
like
things
what
i
can
see
alf
through
so
here
s
how
he
drained
a
of
palm
wine
it
was
now
past
midnight
though
it
was
on
the
island
with
all
good
wishes
the
children
took
their
leave
they
also
collected
the
clergyman
and
took
him
back
to
his
study
and
his
presentation
clock
the
phoenix
kindly
carried
the
seeds
next
day
to
the
burglar
and
his
bride
and
returned
with
the
most
satisfactory
news
of
the
happy
pair
he
s
made
a

started
on
his
allotment
it
said
and
she

weaving
him
a
shirt
and
trousers
of
the
most
radiant
the
police
never
knew
how
the
burglar
got
away
in
kentish
town
police
station
his
escape
is
still
spoken
of
with
bated
breath
as
the
persian
mystery
as
for
the
reverend
septimus
blenkinsop
he
felt
that
he
had
had
a
very
insane
fit
indeed
and
he
was
sure
it
was
due
to
so
he
planned
a
little
dissipation
and
took
his
two
maiden
aunts
to
paris
where
they
enjoyed
a
dazzling
round
of
museums
and
picture
galleries
and
came
back
feeling
that
they
had
indeed
seen
life
he
never
told
his
aunts
or
any
one
else
about
the
marriage
on
the
island
because
no
one
likes
it
to
be
generally
known
if
he
has
had
insane
fits
however
interesting
and
unusual
chapter
the
hole
in
the
carpet
hooray
hooray
hooray
mother
comes
home
mother
comes
home
hooray
hooray
hooray
jane
sang
this
simple
song
directly
after
breakfast
and
the
phoenix
shed
crystal
tears
of
affectionate
sympathy
how
beautiful
it
said
is
filial
devotion
she
won
t
be
home
till
past
bedtime
though
said
robert
we
might
have
one
more
he
was
glad
that
mother
was
coming
home
quite
glad
very
glad
but
at
the
same
time
that
gladness
was
rudely
contradicted
by
a
quite
strong
feeling
of
sorrow
because
now
they
could
not
go
out
all
day
on
the
carpet
i
do
wish
we
could
go
and
get
something
nice
for
mother
only
she
d
want
to
know
where
we
got
it
said
anthea
and
she
d
never
never
believe
it
the
truth
people
never
do
somehow
if
it
s
at
all
i
ll
tell
you
what
said
robert
suppose
we
wished
the
carpet
to
take
us
somewhere
where
we
could
find
a
purse
with
money
in
it
then
we
could
buy
her
suppose
it
took
us
somewhere
foreign
and
the
purse
was
covered
with
strange
eastern
devices
embroidered
in
rich
silks
and
full
of
money
that
wasn
t
money
at
all
here
only
foreign
curiosities
then
we
couldn
t
spend
it
and
people
would
bother
about
where
we
got
it
and
we
shouldn
t
know
how
on
earth
to
get
out
of
it
at
cyril
moved
the
table
off
the
carpet
as
he
spoke
and
its
leg
caught
in
one
of
anthea
s
darns
and
ripped
away
most
of
it
as
well
as
a
large
slit
in
the
carpet
well
now
you
have
done
it
said
robert
but
anthea
was
a
really
sister
she
did
not
say
a
word
till
she
had
got
out
the
scotch
fingering
wool
and
the
and
the
thimble
and
the
scissors
and
by
that
time
she
had
been
able
to
get
the
better
of
her
natural
wish
to
be
thoroughly
disagreeable
and
was
able
to
say
quite
kindly
never
mind
squirrel
i
ll
soon
mend
cyril
thumped
her
on
the
back
he
understood
exactly
how
she
had
felt
and
he
was
not
an
ungrateful
brother
respecting
the
purse
containing
coins
the
phoenix
said
scratching
its
invisible
ear
thoughtfully
with
its
shining
claw
it
might
be
as
well
perhaps
to
state
clearly
the
amount
which
you
wish
to
find
as
well
as
the
country
where
you
wish
to
find
it
and
the
nature
of
the
coins
which
you
prefer
it
would
be
indeed
a
cold
moment
when
you
should
find
a
purse
containing
but
three
how
much
is
an
oboloi
an
obol
is
about
twopence
halfpenny
the
phoenix
replied
yes
said
jane
and
if
you
find
a
purse
i
suppose
it
is
only
because
some
one
has
lost
it
and
you
ought
to
take
it
to
the
the
situation
remarked
the
phoenix
does
indeed
bristle
with
what
about
a
buried
treasure
said
cyril
and
every
one
was
dead
that
it
belonged
to
mother
wouldn
t
believe
that
said
more
than
one
voice
suppose
said
robert
suppose
we
asked
to
be
taken
where
we
could
find
a
purse
and
give
it
back
to
the
person
it
belonged
to
and
they
would
give
us
something
for
finding
it
we
aren
t
allowed
to
take
money
from
strangers
you
know
we
aren
t
bobs
said
anthea
making
a
knot
at
the
end
of
a
needleful
of
scotch
fingering
wool
which
is
very
wrong
and
you
must
never
do
it
when
you
are
darning
no
that
wouldn
t
do
said
cyril
let
s
chuck
it
and
go
to
the
north
pole
or
somewhere
really
no
said
the
girls
together
there
must
be
some
wait
a
sec
anthea
added
i
ve
got
an
idea
coming
don
t
there
was
a
silence
as
she
paused
with
the
in
the
air
suddenly
she
spoke
i
see
let
s
tell
the
carpet
to
take
us
somewhere
where
we
can
get
the
money
for
mother
s
present
and
and
and
get
it
some
way
that
she
ll
believe
in
and
not
think
well
i
must
say
you
are
learning
the
way
to
get
the
most
out
of
the
carpet
said
cyril
he
spoke
more
heartily
and
kindly
than
usual
because
he
remembered
how
anthea
had
refrained
from
snarking
him
about
tearing
the
carpet
yes
said
the
phoenix
you
certainly
are
and
you
have
to
remember
that
if
you
take
a
thing
out
it
doesn
t
stay
no
one
paid
any
attention
to
this
remark
at
the
time
but
afterwards
every
one
thought
of
it
do
hurry
up
panther
said
robert
and
that
was
why
anthea
did
hurry
up
and
why
the
big
darn
in
the
middle
of
the
carpet
was
all
open
and
webby
like
a
fishing
net
not
tight
and
close
like
woven
cloth
which
is
what
a
good
darn
should
be
then
every
one
put
on
its
outdoor
things
the
phoenix
fluttered
on
to
the
mantelpiece
and
arranged
its
golden
feathers
in
the
glass
and
all
was
ready
every
one
got
on
to
the
carpet
please
go
slowly
dear
carpet
anthea
began
we
like
to
see
where
we
re
and
then
she
added
the
difficult
wish
that
had
been
decided
on
next
moment
the
carpet
stiff
and
raftlike
was
sailing
over
the
roofs
of
kentish
town
i
wish
no
i
don
t
mean
that
i
mean
it
s
a
pity
we
aren
t
higher
up
said
anthea
as
the
edge
of
the
carpet
grazed
a
that
s
right
be
careful
said
the
phoenix
in
warning
tones
if
you
wish
when
you
re
on
a
wishing
carpet
you
do
wish
and
there
s
an
end
of
so
for
a
short
time
no
one
spoke
and
the
carpet
sailed
on
in
calm
magnificence
over
st
pancras
and
king
s
cross
stations
and
over
the
crowded
streets
of
clerkenwell
we
re
going
out
greenwich
way
said
cyril
as
they
crossed
the
streak
of
rough
tumbled
water
that
was
the
thames
we
might
go
and
have
a
look
at
the
on
and
on
the
carpet
swept
still
keeping
much
nearer
to
the
than
the
children
found
at
all
comfortable
and
then
just
over
new
cross
a
terrible
thing
happened
jane
and
robert
were
in
the
middle
of
the
carpet
part
of
them
was
on
the
carpet
and
part
of
them
the
heaviest
part
was
on
the
great
central
darn
it
s
all
very
misty
said
jane
it
looks
partly
like
out
of
doors
and
partly
like
in
the
nursery
at
home
i
feel
as
if
i
was
going
to
have
measles
everything
looked
awfully
rum
then
i
feel
just
exactly
the
same
robert
said
it
s
the
hole
said
the
phoenix
it
s
not
measles
whatever
that
possession
may
and
at
that
both
robert
and
jane
suddenly
and
at
once
made
a
bound
to
try
and
get
on
to
the
safer
part
of
the
carpet
and
the
darn
gave
way
and
their
boots
went
up
and
the
heavy
heads
and
bodies
of
them
went
down
through
the
hole
and
they
landed
in
a
position
something
between
sitting
and
sprawling
on
the
flat
leads
on
the
top
of
a
high
grey
gloomy
respectable
house
whose
address
was
amersham
road
new
cross
the
carpet
seemed
to
awaken
to
new
energy
as
soon
as
it
had
got
rid
of
their
weight
and
it
rose
high
in
the
air
the
others
lay
down
flat
and
peeped
over
the
edge
of
the
rising
carpet
are
you
hurt
cried
cyril
and
robert
shouted
no
and
next
moment
the
carpet
had
sped
away
and
jane
and
robert
were
hidden
from
the
sight
of
the
others
by
a
stack
of
smoky
chimneys
oh
how
awful
said
anthea
it
might
have
been
worse
said
the
phoenix
what
would
have
been
the
sentiments
of
the
survivors
if
that
darn
had
given
way
when
we
were
crossing
the
river
yes
there
s
that
said
cyril
recovering
himself
they
ll
be
all
right
they
ll
howl
till
some
one
gets
them
down
or
drop
tiles
into
the
front
garden
to
attract
attention
of
passersby
bobs
has
got
my
lucky
you
forgot
to
mend
that
hole
in
my
pocket
panther
or
he
wouldn
t
have
had
it
they
can
tram
it
but
anthea
would
not
be
comforted
it
s
all
my
fault
she
said
i
knew
the
proper
way
to
darn
and
i
didn
t
do
it
it
s
all
my
fault
let
s
go
home
and
patch
the
carpet
with
your
etons
something
really
strong
and
send
it
to
fetch
all
right
said
cyril
but
your
sunday
jacket
is
stronger
than
my
etons
we
must
just
chuck
mother
s
present
that
s
all
i
wish
stop
cried
the
phoenix
the
carpet
is
dropping
to
and
indeed
it
was
it
sank
swiftly
yet
steadily
and
landed
on
the
pavement
of
the
deptford
road
it
tipped
a
little
as
it
landed
so
that
cyril
and
anthea
naturally
walked
off
it
and
in
an
instant
it
had
rolled
itself
up
and
hidden
behind
a
it
did
this
so
quickly
that
not
a
single
person
in
the
deptford
road
noticed
it
the
phoenix
rustled
its
way
into
the
breast
of
cyril
s
coat
and
almost
at
the
same
moment
a
voice
remarked
well
i
never
what
on
earth
are
you
doing
here
they
were
face
to
face
with
their
pet
uncle
their
uncle
reginald
we
did
think
of
going
to
greenwich
palace
and
talking
about
nelson
said
cyril
telling
as
much
of
the
truth
as
he
thought
his
uncle
could
believe
and
where
are
the
others
asked
uncle
reginald
i
don
t
exactly
know
cyril
replied
this
time
quite
truthfully
well
said
uncle
reginald
i
must
fly
i
ve
a
case
in
the
county
court
that
s
the
worst
of
being
a
beastly
solicitor
one
can
t
take
the
chances
of
life
when
one
gets
them
if
only
i
could
come
with
you
to
the
painted
hall
and
give
you
lunch
at
the
ship
afterwards
but
alas
it
may
not
the
uncle
felt
in
his
pocket
mustn
t
enjoy
myself
he
said
but
that
s
no
reason
why
you
shouldn
t
here
divide
this
by
four
and
the
product
ought
to
give
you
some
desired
result
take
care
of
yourselves
and
waving
a
cheery
farewell
with
his
neat
umbrella
the
good
and
uncle
passed
away
leaving
cyril
and
anthea
to
exchange
eloquent
glances
over
the
shining
golden
sovereign
that
lay
in
cyril
s
hand
well
said
anthea
well
said
cyril
well
said
the
phoenix
good
old
carpet
said
cyril
joyously
it
was
clever
of
it
so
adequate
and
yet
so
simple
said
the
phoenix
with
calm
approval
oh
come
on
home
and
let
s
mend
the
carpet
i
am
a
beast
i
d
forgotten
the
others
just
for
a
minute
said
the
anthea
they
unrolled
the
carpet
quickly
and
slyly
they
did
not
want
to
attract
public
attention
and
the
moment
their
feet
were
on
the
carpet
anthea
wished
to
be
at
home
and
instantly
they
were
the
kindness
of
their
excellent
uncle
had
made
it
unnecessary
for
them
to
go
to
such
extremes
as
cyril
s
etons
or
anthea
s
sunday
jacket
for
the
patching
of
the
carpet
anthea
set
to
work
at
once
to
draw
the
edges
of
the
broken
darn
together
and
cyril
hastily
went
out
and
bought
a
large
piece
of
the
american
which
careful
use
to
cover
dressers
and
kitchen
tables
it
was
the
strongest
thing
he
could
think
of
then
they
set
to
work
to
line
the
carpet
throughout
with
the
the
nursery
felt
very
odd
and
empty
without
the
others
and
cyril
did
not
feel
so
sure
as
he
had
done
about
their
being
able
to
tram
it
home
so
he
tried
to
help
anthea
which
was
very
good
of
him
but
not
much
use
to
her
the
phoenix
watched
them
for
a
time
but
it
was
plainly
growing
more
and
more
restless
it
fluffed
up
its
splendid
feathers
and
stood
first
on
one
gilded
claw
and
then
on
the
other
and
at
last
it
said
i
can
bear
it
no
longer
this
suspense
my
robert
who
set
my
egg
to
hatch
in
the
bosom
of
whose
norfolk
raiment
i
have
nestled
so
often
and
so
pleasantly
i
think
if
you
ll
excuse
me
yes
do
cried
anthea
i
wish
we
d
thought
of
asking
you
cyril
opened
the
window
the
phoenix
flapped
its
sunbright
wings
and
vanished
so
that
s
all
right
said
cyril
taking
up
his
needle
and
instantly
pricking
his
hand
in
a
new
place
of
course
i
know
that
what
you
have
really
wanted
to
know
about
all
this
time
is
not
what
anthea
and
cyril
did
but
what
happened
to
jane
and
robert
after
they
fell
through
the
carpet
on
to
the
leads
of
the
house
which
was
called
number
amersham
road
but
i
had
to
tell
you
the
other
first
that
is
one
of
the
most
annoying
things
about
stories
you
can
not
tell
all
the
different
parts
of
them
at
the
same
time
robert
s
first
remark
when
he
found
himself
seated
on
the
damp
cold
sooty
leads
was
here
s
a
go
jane
s
first
act
was
tears
dry
up
pussy
don
t
be
a
little
duffer
said
her
brother
kindly
it
ll
be
all
and
then
he
looked
about
just
as
cyril
had
known
he
would
for
something
to
throw
down
so
as
to
attract
the
attention
of
the
wayfarers
far
below
in
the
street
he
could
not
find
anything
curiously
enough
there
were
no
stones
on
the
leads
not
even
a
loose
tile
the
roof
was
of
slate
and
every
single
slate
knew
its
place
and
kept
it
but
as
so
often
happens
in
looking
for
one
thing
he
found
another
there
was
a
leading
down
into
the
house
and
that
was
not
fastened
stop
snivelling
and
come
here
jane
he
cried
encouragingly
lend
a
hand
to
heave
this
up
if
we
can
get
into
the
house
we
might
sneak
down
without
meeting
any
one
with
luck
come
they
heaved
up
the
door
till
it
stood
straight
up
and
as
they
bent
to
look
into
the
hole
below
the
door
fell
back
with
a
hollow
clang
on
the
leads
behind
and
with
its
noise
was
mingled
a
scream
from
underneath
discovered
hissed
robert
oh
my
cats
alive
they
were
indeed
discovered
they
found
themselves
looking
down
into
an
attic
which
was
also
a
it
had
boxes
and
broken
chairs
old
fenders
and
and
hanging
from
nails
in
the
middle
of
the
floor
was
a
box
open
half
full
of
clothes
other
clothes
lay
on
the
floor
in
neat
piles
in
the
middle
of
the
piles
of
clothes
sat
a
lady
very
fat
indeed
with
her
feet
sticking
out
straight
in
front
of
her
and
it
was
she
who
had
screamed
and
who
in
fact
was
still
screaming
don
t
cried
jane
please
don
t
we
won
t
hurt
where
are
the
rest
of
your
gang
asked
the
lady
stopping
short
in
the
middle
of
a
scream
the
others
have
gone
on
on
the
wishing
carpet
said
jane
truthfully
the
wishing
carpet
said
the
lady
yes
said
jane
before
robert
could
say
you
shut
up
you
must
have
read
about
it
the
phoenix
is
with
then
the
lady
got
up
and
picking
her
way
carefully
between
the
piles
of
clothes
she
got
to
the
door
and
through
it
she
shut
it
behind
her
and
the
two
children
could
hear
her
calling
septimus
septimus
in
a
loud
yet
frightened
way
now
said
robert
quickly
i
ll
drop
he
hung
by
his
hands
and
dropped
through
the
now
you
hang
by
your
hands
i
ll
catch
you
oh
there
s
no
time
for
jaw
drop
i
jane
dropped
robert
tried
to
catch
her
and
even
before
they
had
finished
the
breathless
roll
among
the
piles
of
clothes
which
was
what
his
catching
ended
in
he
whispered
we
ll
hide
behind
those
fenders
and
things
they
ll
think
we
ve
gone
along
the
roofs
then
when
all
is
calm
we
ll
creep
down
the
stairs
and
take
our
they
hastily
hid
a
corner
of
an
iron
bedstead
stuck
into
robert
s
side
and
jane
had
only
standing
room
for
one
foot
but
they
bore
it
and
when
the
lady
came
back
not
with
septimus
but
with
another
lady
they
held
their
breath
and
their
hearts
beat
thickly
gone
said
the
first
lady
poor
little
things
quite
mad
my
dear
and
at
large
we
must
lock
this
room
and
send
for
the
let
me
look
out
said
the
second
lady
who
was
if
possible
older
and
thinner
and
primmer
than
the
first
so
the
two
ladies
dragged
a
box
under
the
and
put
another
box
on
the
top
of
it
and
then
they
both
climbed
up
very
carefully
and
put
their
two
trim
tidy
heads
out
of
the
to
look
for
the
mad
children
now
whispered
robert
getting
the
bedstead
leg
out
of
his
side
they
managed
to
creep
out
from
their
and
out
through
the
door
before
the
two
ladies
had
done
looking
out
of
the
on
to
the
empty
leads
robert
and
jane
tiptoed
down
the
stairs
one
flight
two
flights
then
they
looked
over
the
banisters
horror
a
servant
was
coming
up
with
a
loaded
scuttle
the
children
with
one
consent
crept
swiftly
through
the
first
open
door
the
room
was
a
study
calm
and
gentlemanly
with
rows
of
books
a
writing
table
and
a
pair
of
embroidered
slippers
warming
themselves
in
the
fender
the
children
hid
behind
the
as
they
passed
the
table
they
saw
on
it
a
with
its
bottom
label
torn
off
open
and
empty
oh
how
awful
whispered
jane
we
shall
never
get
away
hush
said
robert
not
a
moment
too
soon
for
there
were
steps
on
the
stairs
and
next
instant
the
two
ladies
came
into
the
room
they
did
not
see
the
children
but
they
saw
the
empty
missionary
box
i
knew
it
said
one
selina
it
was
a
gang
i
was
certain
of
it
from
the
first
the
children
were
not
mad
they
were
sent
to
distract
our
attention
while
their
confederates
robbed
the
i
am
afraid
you
are
right
said
selina
and
where
are
they
now
downstairs
no
doubt
collecting
the
silver
and
and
the
that
was
uncle
joe
s
and
aunt
jerusha
s
teaspoons
i
shall
go
oh
don
t
be
so
rash
and
heroic
said
selina
amelia
we
must
call
the
police
from
the
window
lock
the
door
i
will
i
will
the
words
ended
in
a
yell
as
selina
rushing
to
the
window
came
face
to
face
with
the
hidden
children
oh
don
t
said
jane
how
can
you
be
so
unkind
we
aren
t
burglars
and
we
haven
t
any
gang
and
we
didn
t
open
your
we
opened
our
own
once
but
we
didn
t
have
to
use
the
money
so
our
consciences
made
us
put
it
back
and
don
t
oh
i
wish
you
wouldn
t
miss
selina
had
seized
jane
and
miss
amelia
captured
robert
the
children
found
themselves
held
fast
by
strong
slim
hands
pink
at
the
wrists
and
white
at
the
knuckles
we
ve
got
you
at
any
rate
said
miss
amelia
selina
your
captive
is
smaller
than
mine
you
open
the
window
at
once
and
call
murder
as
loud
as
you
can
selina
obeyed
but
when
she
had
opened
the
window
instead
of
calling
murder
she
called
septimus
because
at
that
very
moment
she
saw
her
nephew
coming
in
at
the
gate
in
another
minute
he
had
let
himself
in
with
his
and
had
mounted
the
stairs
as
he
came
into
the
room
jane
and
robert
each
uttered
a
shriek
of
joy
so
loud
and
so
sudden
that
the
ladies
leaped
with
surprise
and
nearly
let
them
go
it
s
our
own
clergyman
cried
jane
don
t
you
remember
us
asked
robert
you
married
our
burglar
for
us
don
t
you
remember
i
knew
it
was
a
gang
said
amelia
septimus
these
abandoned
children
are
members
of
a
desperate
burgling
gang
who
are
robbing
the
house
they
have
already
forced
the
and
purloined
its
the
reverend
septimus
passed
his
hand
wearily
over
his
brow
i
feel
a
little
faint
he
said
running
upstairs
so
we
never
touched
the
beastly
box
said
robert
then
your
confederates
did
said
miss
selina
no
no
said
the
curate
hastily
opened
the
box
myself
this
morning
i
found
i
had
not
enough
small
change
for
the
mothers
independent
unity
measles
and
croup
insurance
payments
i
suppose
this
is
not
a
dream
is
it
dream
no
indeed
search
the
house
i
insist
upon
the
curate
still
pale
and
trembling
searched
the
house
which
of
course
was
blamelessly
free
of
burglars
when
he
came
back
he
sank
wearily
into
his
chair
aren
t
you
going
to
let
us
go
asked
robert
with
furious
indignation
for
there
is
something
in
being
held
by
a
strong
lady
that
sets
the
blood
of
a
boy
boiling
in
his
veins
with
anger
and
despair
we
ve
never
done
anything
to
you
it
s
all
the
carpet
it
dropped
us
on
the
leads
we
couldn
t
help
it
you
know
how
it
carried
you
over
to
the
island
and
you
had
to
marry
the
burglar
to
the
oh
my
head
said
the
curate
never
mind
your
head
just
now
said
robert
try
to
be
honest
and
honourable
and
do
your
duty
in
that
state
of
life
this
is
a
judgement
on
me
for
something
i
suppose
said
the
reverend
septimus
wearily
but
i
really
can
not
at
the
moment
remember
send
for
the
police
said
miss
selina
send
for
a
doctor
said
the
curate
do
you
think
they
are
mad
then
said
miss
amelia
i
think
i
am
said
the
curate
jane
had
been
crying
ever
since
her
capture
now
she
said
you
aren
t
now
but
perhaps
you
will
be
if
and
it
would
serve
you
jolly
well
right
aunt
selina
said
the
curate
and
aunt
amelia
believe
me
this
is
only
an
insane
dream
you
will
realize
it
soon
it
has
happened
to
me
before
but
do
not
let
us
be
unjust
even
in
a
dream
do
not
hold
the
children
they
have
done
no
harm
as
i
said
before
it
was
i
who
opened
the
the
strong
bony
hands
unwillingly
loosened
their
grasp
robert
shook
himself
and
stood
in
sulky
resentment
but
jane
ran
to
the
curate
and
embraced
him
so
suddenly
that
he
had
not
time
to
defend
himself
you
re
a
dear
she
said
it
is
like
a
dream
just
at
first
but
you
get
used
to
it
now
do
let
us
go
there
s
a
good
kind
honourable
i
don
t
know
said
the
reverend
septimus
it
s
a
difficult
problem
it
is
such
a
very
unusual
dream
perhaps
it
s
only
a
sort
of
other
life
quite
real
enough
for
you
to
be
mad
in
and
if
you
re
mad
there
might
be
a
where
you
d
be
kindly
treated
and
in
time
restored
cured
to
your
sorrowing
relatives
it
is
very
hard
to
see
your
duty
plainly
even
in
ordinary
life
and
these
are
so
complicated
if
it
s
a
dream
said
robert
you
will
wake
up
directly
and
then
you
d
be
sorry
if
you
d
sent
us
into
a
because
you
might
never
get
into
the
same
dream
again
and
let
us
out
and
so
we
might
stay
there
for
ever
and
then
what
about
our
sorrowing
relatives
who
aren
t
in
the
dreams
at
all
but
all
the
curate
could
now
say
was
oh
my
head
and
jane
and
robert
felt
quite
ill
with
helplessness
and
hopelessness
a
really
conscientious
curate
is
a
very
difficult
thing
to
manage
and
then
just
as
the
hopelessness
and
the
helplessness
were
getting
to
be
almost
more
than
they
could
bear
the
two
children
suddenly
felt
that
extraordinary
shrinking
feeling
that
you
always
have
when
you
are
just
going
to
vanish
and
the
next
moment
they
had
vanished
and
the
reverend
septimus
was
left
alone
with
his
aunts
i
knew
it
was
a
dream
he
cried
wildly
i
ve
had
something
like
it
before
did
you
dream
it
too
aunt
selina
and
you
aunt
amelia
i
dreamed
that
you
did
you
aunt
selina
looked
at
him
and
then
at
aunt
amelia
then
she
said
boldly
what
do
you
mean
we
haven
t
been
dreaming
anything
you
must
have
dropped
off
in
your
the
curate
heaved
a
sigh
of
relief
oh
if
it
s
only
he
said
if
we
d
all
dreamed
it
i
could
never
have
believed
it
never
afterwards
aunt
selina
said
to
the
other
aunt
yes
i
know
it
was
an
untruth
and
i
shall
doubtless
be
punished
for
it
in
due
course
but
i
could
see
the
poor
dear
fellow
s
brain
giving
way
before
my
very
eyes
he
couldn
t
have
stood
the
strain
of
three
dreams
it
was
odd
wasn
t
it
all
three
of
us
dreaming
the
same
thing
at
the
same
moment
we
must
never
tell
dear
seppy
but
i
shall
send
an
account
of
it
to
the
psychical
society
with
stars
instead
of
names
you
and
she
did
and
you
can
read
all
about
it
in
one
of
the
society
s
fat
of
course
you
understand
what
had
happened
the
intelligent
phoenix
had
simply
gone
straight
off
to
the
psammead
and
had
wished
robert
and
jane
at
home
and
of
course
they
were
at
home
at
once
cyril
and
anthea
had
not
half
finished
mending
the
carpet
when
the
joyful
emotions
of
reunion
had
calmed
down
a
little
they
all
went
out
and
spent
what
was
left
of
uncle
reginald
s
sovereign
in
presents
for
mother
they
bought
her
a
pink
silk
handkerchief
a
pair
of
blue
and
white
vases
a
bottle
of
scent
a
packet
of
christmas
candles
and
a
cake
of
soap
shaped
and
coloured
like
a
tomato
and
one
that
was
so
like
an
orange
that
almost
any
one
you
had
given
it
to
would
have
tried
to
peel
it
if
they
liked
oranges
of
course
also
they
bought
a
cake
with
icing
on
and
the
rest
of
the
money
they
spent
on
flowers
to
put
in
the
vases
when
they
had
arranged
all
the
things
on
a
table
with
the
candles
stuck
up
on
a
plate
ready
to
light
the
moment
mother
s
cab
was
heard
they
washed
themselves
thoroughly
and
put
on
tidier
clothes
then
robert
said
good
old
psammead
and
the
others
said
so
too
but
really
it
s
just
as
much
good
old
phoenix
said
robert
suppose
it
hadn
t
thought
of
getting
the
wish
ah
said
the
phoenix
it
is
perhaps
fortunate
for
you
that
i
am
such
a
competent
there
s
mother
s
cab
cried
anthea
and
the
phoenix
hid
and
they
lighted
the
candles
and
next
moment
mother
was
home
again
she
liked
her
presents
very
much
and
found
their
story
of
uncle
reginald
and
the
sovereign
easy
and
even
pleasant
to
believe
good
old
carpet
were
cyril
s
last
sleepy
words
what
there
is
of
it
said
the
phoenix
from
the
chapter
the
beginning
of
the
end
well
i
must
say
mother
said
looking
at
the
wishing
carpet
as
it
lay
all
darned
and
mended
and
backed
with
shiny
american
cloth
on
the
floor
of
the
nursery
i
must
say
i
ve
never
in
my
life
bought
such
a
bad
bargain
as
that
a
soft
oh
of
contradiction
sprang
to
the
lips
of
cyril
robert
jane
and
anthea
mother
looked
at
them
quickly
and
said
well
of
course
i
see
you
ve
mended
it
very
nicely
and
that
was
sweet
of
you
the
boys
helped
too
said
the
dears
honourably
but
still
and
ninepence
it
ought
to
have
lasted
for
years
it
s
simply
dreadful
now
well
never
mind
darlings
you
ve
done
your
best
i
think
we
ll
have
coconut
matting
next
time
a
carpet
doesn
t
have
an
easy
life
of
it
in
this
room
does
it
it
s
not
our
fault
mother
is
it
that
our
boots
are
the
really
reliable
kind
robert
asked
the
question
more
in
sorrow
than
in
anger
no
dear
we
can
t
help
our
boots
said
mother
cheerfully
but
we
might
change
them
when
we
come
in
perhaps
it
s
just
an
idea
of
mine
i
wouldn
t
dream
of
scolding
on
the
very
first
morning
after
i
ve
come
home
oh
my
lamb
how
could
you
this
conversation
was
at
breakfast
and
the
lamb
had
been
beautifully
good
until
every
one
was
looking
at
the
carpet
and
then
it
was
for
him
but
the
work
of
a
moment
to
turn
a
glass
dish
of
syrupy
blackberry
jam
upside
down
on
his
young
head
it
was
the
work
of
a
good
many
minutes
and
several
persons
to
get
the
jam
off
him
again
and
this
interesting
work
took
people
s
minds
off
the
carpet
and
nothing
more
was
said
just
then
about
its
badness
as
a
bargain
and
about
what
mother
hoped
for
from
coconut
matting
when
the
lamb
was
clean
again
he
had
to
be
taken
care
of
while
mother
rumpled
her
hair
and
inked
her
fingers
and
made
her
head
ache
over
the
difficult
and
twisted
accounts
which
cook
gave
her
on
dirty
bits
of
paper
and
which
were
supposed
to
explain
how
it
was
that
cook
had
only
and
a
lot
of
unpaid
bills
left
out
of
all
the
money
mother
had
sent
her
for
mother
was
very
clever
but
even
she
could
not
quite
understand
the
cook
s
accounts
the
lamb
was
very
glad
to
have
his
brothers
and
sisters
to
play
with
him
he
had
not
forgotten
them
a
bit
and
he
made
them
play
all
the
old
exhausting
games
whirling
worlds
where
you
swing
the
baby
round
and
round
by
his
hands
and
leg
and
wing
where
you
swing
him
from
side
to
side
by
one
ankle
and
one
wrist
there
was
also
climbing
vesuvius
in
this
game
the
baby
walks
up
you
and
when
he
is
standing
on
your
shoulders
you
shout
as
loud
as
you
can
which
is
the
rumbling
of
the
burning
mountain
and
then
tumble
him
gently
on
to
the
floor
and
roll
him
there
which
is
the
destruction
of
pompeii
all
the
same
i
wish
we
could
decide
what
we
d
better
say
next
time
mother
says
anything
about
the
carpet
said
cyril
breathlessly
ceasing
to
be
a
burning
mountain
well
you
talk
and
decide
said
anthea
here
you
lovely
ducky
lamb
come
to
panther
and
play
noah
s
the
lamb
came
with
his
pretty
hair
all
tumbled
and
his
face
all
dusty
from
the
destruction
of
pompeii
and
instantly
became
a
baby
snake
hissing
and
wriggling
and
creeping
in
anthea
s
arms
as
she
said
i
love
my
little
baby
snake
he
hisses
when
he
is
awake
he
creeps
with
such
a
wriggly
creep
he
wriggles
even
in
his
crocky
said
the
lamb
and
showed
all
his
little
teeth
so
anthea
went
on
i
love
my
little
crocodile
i
love
his
truthful
toothful
smile
it
is
so
wonderful
and
wide
i
like
to
see
it
from
well
you
see
cyril
was
saying
it
s
just
the
old
bother
mother
can
t
believe
the
real
true
truth
about
the
carpet
and
you
speak
sooth
o
cyril
remarked
the
phoenix
coming
out
from
the
cupboard
where
the
blackbeetles
lived
and
the
torn
books
and
the
broken
slates
and
odd
pieces
of
toys
that
had
lost
the
rest
of
themselves
now
hear
the
wisdom
of
phoenix
the
son
of
the
phoenix
there
is
a
society
called
that
said
cyril
where
is
it
and
what
is
a
society
asked
the
bird
it
s
a
sort
of
lot
of
people
a
sort
of
brotherhood
a
kind
of
well
something
very
like
your
temple
you
know
only
quite
i
take
your
meaning
said
the
phoenix
i
would
fain
see
these
calling
themselves
sons
of
the
but
what
about
your
words
of
wisdom
wisdom
is
always
welcome
said
the
phoenix
pretty
polly
remarked
the
lamb
reaching
his
hands
towards
the
golden
speaker
the
phoenix
modestly
retreated
behind
robert
and
anthea
hastened
to
distract
the
attention
of
the
lamb
by
murmuring
i
love
my
little
baby
rabbit
but
oh
he
has
a
dreadful
habit
of
paddling
out
among
the
rocks
and
soaking
both
his
bunny
i
don
t
think
you
d
care
about
the
sons
of
the
phoenix
really
said
robert
i
have
heard
that
they
don
t
do
anything
fiery
they
only
drink
a
great
deal
much
more
than
other
people
because
they
drink
lemonade
and
fizzy
things
and
the
more
you
drink
of
those
the
more
good
you
in
your
mind
perhaps
said
jane
but
it
wouldn
t
be
good
in
your
body
you
d
get
too
the
phoenix
yawned
look
here
said
anthea
i
really
have
an
idea
this
isn
t
like
a
common
carpet
it
s
very
magic
indeed
don
t
you
think
if
we
put
tatcho
on
it
and
then
gave
it
a
rest
the
magic
part
of
it
might
grow
like
hair
is
supposed
to
do
it
might
said
robert
but
i
should
think
paraffin
would
do
as
well
at
any
rate
as
far
as
the
smell
goes
and
that
seems
to
be
the
great
thing
about
but
with
all
its
faults
anthea
s
idea
was
something
to
do
and
they
did
it
it
was
cyril
who
fetched
the
tatcho
bottle
from
father
s
but
the
bottle
had
not
much
in
it
we
mustn
t
take
it
all
jane
said
in
case
father
s
hair
began
to
come
off
suddenly
if
he
hadn
t
anything
to
put
on
it
it
might
all
drop
off
before
eliza
had
time
to
get
round
to
the
chemist
s
for
another
bottle
it
would
be
dreadful
to
have
a
bald
father
and
it
would
all
be
our
and
wigs
are
very
expensive
i
believe
said
anthea
look
here
leave
enough
in
the
bottle
to
wet
father
s
head
all
over
with
in
case
any
emergency
emerges
and
let
s
make
up
with
paraffin
i
expect
it
s
the
smell
that
does
the
good
really
and
the
smell
s
exactly
the
so
a
small
teaspoonful
of
the
tatcho
was
put
on
the
edges
of
the
worst
darn
in
the
carpet
and
rubbed
carefully
into
the
roots
of
the
hairs
of
it
and
all
the
parts
that
there
was
not
enough
tatcho
for
had
paraffin
rubbed
into
them
with
a
piece
of
flannel
then
the
flannel
was
burned
it
made
a
gay
flame
which
delighted
the
phoenix
and
the
lamb
how
often
said
mother
opening
the
door
how
often
am
i
to
tell
you
that
you
are
not
to
play
with
paraffin
what
have
you
been
doing
we
have
burnt
a
paraffiny
rag
anthea
answered
it
was
no
use
telling
mother
what
they
had
done
to
the
carpet
she
did
not
know
it
was
a
magic
carpet
and
no
one
wants
to
be
laughed
at
for
trying
to
mend
an
ordinary
carpet
with
well
don
t
do
it
again
said
mother
and
now
away
with
melancholy
father
has
sent
a
telegram
look
she
held
it
out
and
the
children
holding
it
by
its
yielding
corners
read
box
for
kiddies
at
garrick
stalls
for
us
haymarket
meet
charing
cross
that
means
said
mother
that
you
re
going
to
see
the
water
babies
all
by
your
happy
selves
and
father
and
i
will
take
you
and
fetch
you
give
me
the
lamb
dear
and
you
and
jane
put
clean
lace
in
your
red
evening
frocks
and
i
shouldn
t
wonder
if
you
found
they
wanted
ironing
this
paraffin
smell
is
ghastly
run
and
get
out
your
the
frocks
did
want
ironing
wanted
it
rather
badly
as
it
happened
for
being
of
liberty
silk
they
had
been
found
very
useful
for
tableaux
vivants
when
a
red
dress
was
required
for
cardinal
richelieu
they
were
very
nice
tableaux
these
and
i
wish
i
could
tell
you
about
them
but
one
can
not
tell
everything
in
a
story
you
would
have
been
specially
interested
in
hearing
about
the
tableau
of
the
princes
in
the
tower
when
one
of
the
pillows
burst
and
the
youthful
princes
were
so
covered
with
feathers
that
the
picture
might
very
well
have
been
called
michaelmas
eve
or
plucking
the
geese
ironing
the
dresses
and
sewing
the
lace
in
occupied
some
time
and
no
one
was
dull
because
there
was
the
theatre
to
look
forward
to
and
also
the
possible
growth
of
hairs
on
the
carpet
for
which
every
one
kept
looking
anxiously
by
four
o
clock
jane
was
almost
sure
that
several
hairs
were
beginning
to
grow
the
phoenix
perched
on
the
fender
and
its
conversation
as
usual
was
entertaining
and
instructive
like
school
prizes
are
said
to
be
but
it
seemed
a
little
and
even
a
little
sad
don
t
you
feel
well
phoenix
dear
asked
anthea
stooping
to
take
an
iron
off
the
fire
i
am
not
sick
replied
the
golden
bird
with
a
gloomy
shake
of
the
head
but
i
am
getting
why
you
ve
hardly
been
hatched
any
time
at
time
remarked
the
phoenix
is
measured
by
heartbeats
i
m
sure
the
palpitations
i
ve
had
since
i
ve
known
you
are
enough
to
blanch
the
feathers
of
any
but
i
thought
you
lived
years
said
robert
and
you
ve
hardly
begun
this
set
of
years
think
of
all
the
time
that
s
before
time
said
the
phoenix
is
as
you
are
probably
aware
merely
a
convenient
fiction
there
is
no
such
thing
as
time
i
have
lived
in
these
two
months
at
a
pace
which
generously
counterbalances
years
of
life
in
the
desert
i
am
old
i
am
weary
i
feel
as
if
i
ought
to
lay
my
egg
and
lay
me
down
to
my
fiery
sleep
but
unless
i
m
careful
i
shall
be
hatched
again
instantly
and
that
is
a
misfortune
which
i
really
do
not
think
i
could
endure
but
do
not
let
me
intrude
these
desperate
personal
reflections
on
your
youthful
happiness
what
is
the
show
at
the
theatre
wrestlers
gladiators
a
combat
of
cameleopards
and
unicorns
i
don
t
think
so
said
cyril
it
s
called
the
water
babies
and
if
it
s
like
the
book
there
isn
t
any
gladiating
in
it
there
are
and
professors
and
a
lobster
and
an
otter
and
a
salmon
and
children
living
in
the
it
sounds
the
phoenix
shivered
and
went
to
sit
on
the
tongs
i
don
t
suppose
there
will
be
real
water
said
jane
and
theatres
are
very
warm
and
pretty
with
a
lot
of
gold
and
lamps
wouldn
t
you
like
to
come
with
us
was
just
going
to
say
that
said
robert
in
injured
tones
only
i
know
how
rude
it
is
to
interrupt
do
come
phoenix
old
chap
it
will
cheer
you
up
it
ll
make
you
laugh
like
any
thing
mr
bourchier
always
makes
ripping
plays
you
ought
to
have
seen
peter
last
your
words
are
strange
said
the
phoenix
but
i
will
come
with
you
the
revels
of
this
bourchier
of
whom
you
speak
may
help
me
to
forget
the
weight
of
my
so
that
evening
the
phoenix
snugged
inside
the
waistcoat
of
robert
s
etons
a
very
tight
fit
it
seemed
both
to
robert
and
to
the
phoenix
and
was
taken
to
the
play
robert
had
to
pretend
to
be
cold
at
the
glittering
restaurant
where
they
ate
dinner
with
father
in
evening
dress
with
a
very
shiny
white
and
mother
looking
lovely
in
her
grey
evening
dress
that
changes
into
pink
and
green
when
she
moves
robert
pretended
that
he
was
too
cold
to
take
off
his
and
so
sat
sweltering
through
what
would
otherwise
have
been
a
most
thrilling
meal
he
felt
that
he
was
a
blot
on
the
smart
beauty
of
the
family
and
he
hoped
the
phoenix
knew
what
he
was
suffering
for
its
sake
of
course
we
are
all
pleased
to
suffer
for
the
sake
of
others
but
we
like
them
to
know
it
unless
we
are
the
very
best
and
noblest
kind
of
people
and
robert
was
just
ordinary
father
was
full
of
jokes
and
fun
and
every
one
laughed
all
the
time
even
with
their
mouths
full
which
is
not
manners
robert
thought
father
would
not
have
been
quite
so
funny
about
his
keeping
his
on
if
father
had
known
all
the
truth
and
there
robert
was
probably
right
when
dinner
was
finished
to
the
last
grape
and
the
last
paddle
in
the
finger
glasses
for
it
was
a
really
truly
dinner
the
children
were
taken
to
the
theatre
guided
to
a
box
close
to
the
stage
and
left
father
s
parting
words
were
now
don
t
you
stir
out
of
this
box
whatever
you
do
i
shall
be
back
before
the
end
of
the
play
be
good
and
you
will
be
happy
is
this
zone
torrid
enough
for
the
abandonment
of
bobs
no
well
then
i
should
say
you
were
sickening
for
something
mumps
or
measles
or
thrush
or
teething
he
went
and
robert
was
at
last
able
to
remove
his
coat
mop
his
perspiring
brow
and
release
the
crushed
and
dishevelled
phoenix
robert
had
to
arrange
his
damp
hair
at
the
at
the
back
of
the
box
and
the
phoenix
had
to
preen
its
disordered
feathers
for
some
time
before
either
of
them
was
fit
to
be
seen
they
were
very
very
early
when
the
lights
went
up
fully
the
phoenix
balancing
itself
on
the
gilded
back
of
a
chair
swayed
in
ecstasy
how
fair
a
scene
is
this
it
murmured
how
far
fairer
than
my
temple
or
have
i
guessed
aright
have
you
brought
me
hither
to
lift
up
my
heart
with
emotions
of
joyous
surprise
tell
me
my
robert
is
it
not
that
this
this
is
my
true
temple
and
the
other
was
but
a
humble
shrine
frequented
by
outcasts
i
don
t
know
about
outcasts
said
robert
but
you
can
call
this
your
temple
if
you
like
hush
the
music
is
i
am
not
going
to
tell
you
about
the
play
as
i
said
before
one
can
t
tell
everything
and
no
doubt
you
saw
the
water
babies
yourselves
if
you
did
not
it
was
a
shame
or
rather
a
pity
what
i
must
tell
you
is
that
though
cyril
and
jane
and
robert
and
anthea
enjoyed
it
as
much
as
any
children
possibly
could
the
pleasure
of
the
phoenix
was
far
far
greater
than
theirs
this
is
indeed
my
temple
it
said
again
and
again
what
radiant
rites
and
all
to
do
honour
to
me
the
songs
in
the
play
it
took
to
be
hymns
in
its
honour
the
choruses
were
choric
songs
in
its
praise
the
electric
lights
it
said
were
magic
torches
lighted
for
its
sake
and
it
was
so
charmed
with
the
footlights
that
the
children
could
hardly
persuade
it
to
sit
still
but
when
the
limelight
was
shown
it
could
contain
its
approval
no
longer
it
flapped
its
golden
wings
and
cried
in
a
voice
that
could
be
heard
all
over
the
theatre
well
done
my
servants
ye
have
my
favour
and
my
countenance
little
tom
on
the
stage
stopped
short
in
what
he
was
saying
a
deep
breath
was
drawn
by
hundreds
of
lungs
every
eye
in
the
house
turned
to
the
box
where
the
luckless
children
cringed
and
most
people
hissed
or
said
shish
or
turn
them
out
then
the
play
went
on
and
an
attendant
presently
came
to
the
box
and
spoke
wrathfully
it
wasn
t
us
indeed
it
wasn
t
said
anthea
earnestly
it
was
the
the
man
said
well
then
they
must
keep
their
bird
very
quiet
disturbing
every
one
like
this
he
said
it
won
t
do
it
again
said
robert
glancing
imploringly
at
the
golden
bird
i
m
sure
it
won
you
have
my
leave
to
depart
said
the
phoenix
gently
well
he
is
a
beauty
and
no
mistake
said
the
attendant
only
i
d
cover
him
up
during
the
acts
it
upsets
the
and
he
went
don
t
speak
again
there
s
a
dear
said
anthea
you
wouldn
t
like
to
interfere
with
your
own
temple
would
you
so
now
the
phoenix
was
quiet
but
it
kept
whispering
to
the
children
it
wanted
to
know
why
there
was
no
altar
no
fire
no
incense
and
became
so
excited
and
fretful
and
tiresome
that
four
at
least
of
the
party
of
five
wished
deeply
that
it
had
been
left
at
home
what
happened
next
was
entirely
the
fault
of
the
phoenix
it
was
not
in
the
least
the
fault
of
the
theatre
people
and
no
one
could
ever
understand
afterwards
how
it
did
happen
no
one
that
is
except
the
guilty
bird
itself
and
the
four
children
the
phoenix
was
balancing
itself
on
the
gilt
back
of
the
chair
swaying
backwards
and
forwards
and
up
and
down
as
you
may
see
your
own
domestic
parrot
do
i
mean
the
grey
one
with
the
red
tail
all
eyes
were
on
the
stage
where
the
lobster
was
delighting
the
audience
with
that
gem
of
a
song
if
you
can
t
walk
straight
walk
sideways
when
the
phoenix
murmured
warmly
no
altar
no
fire
no
incense
and
then
before
any
of
the
children
could
even
begin
to
think
of
stopping
it
it
spread
its
bright
wings
and
swept
round
the
theatre
brushing
its
gleaming
feathers
against
delicate
hangings
and
gilded
woodwork
it
seemed
to
have
made
but
one
circular
such
as
you
may
see
a
gull
make
over
grey
water
on
a
stormy
day
next
moment
it
was
perched
again
on
the
and
all
round
the
theatre
where
it
had
passed
little
sparks
shone
like
tinsel
seeds
then
little
smoke
wreaths
curled
up
like
growing
plants
little
flames
opened
like
people
whispered
then
people
shrieked
fire
fire
the
curtain
went
down
the
lights
went
up
fire
cried
every
one
and
made
for
the
doors
a
magnificent
idea
said
the
phoenix
complacently
an
enormous
altar
fire
supplied
free
of
charge
doesn
t
the
incense
smell
delicious
the
only
smell
was
the
stifling
smell
of
smoke
of
burning
silk
or
scorching
varnish
the
little
flames
had
opened
now
into
great
the
people
in
the
theatre
were
shouting
and
pressing
towards
the
doors
oh
how
could
you
cried
jane
let
s
get
father
said
stay
here
said
anthea
very
pale
and
trying
to
speak
in
her
ordinary
voice
he
didn
t
mean
stay
and
be
roasted
said
robert
no
boys
on
burning
decks
for
me
thank
not
much
said
cyril
and
he
opened
the
door
of
the
box
but
a
fierce
waft
of
smoke
and
hot
air
made
him
shut
it
again
it
was
not
possible
to
get
out
that
way
they
looked
over
the
front
of
the
box
could
they
climb
down
it
would
be
possible
certainly
but
would
they
be
much
better
off
look
at
the
people
moaned
anthea
we
couldn
t
get
and
indeed
the
crowd
round
the
doors
looked
as
thick
as
flies
in
the
season
i
wish
we
d
never
seen
the
phoenix
cried
jane
even
at
that
awful
moment
robert
looked
round
to
see
if
the
bird
had
overheard
a
speech
which
however
natural
was
hardly
polite
or
grateful
the
phoenix
was
gone
look
here
said
cyril
i
ve
read
about
fires
in
papers
i
m
sure
it
s
all
right
let
s
wait
here
as
father
we
can
t
do
anything
else
said
anthea
bitterly
look
here
said
robert
i
m
not
frightened
no
i
m
not
the
phoenix
has
never
been
a
skunk
yet
and
i
m
certain
it
ll
see
us
through
somehow
i
believe
in
the
phoenix
the
phoenix
thanks
you
o
robert
said
a
golden
voice
at
his
feet
and
there
was
the
phoenix
itself
on
the
wishing
carpet
quick
it
said
stand
on
those
portions
of
the
carpet
which
are
truly
antique
and
authentic
and
a
sudden
jet
of
flame
stopped
its
words
alas
the
phoenix
had
unconsciously
warmed
to
its
subject
and
in
the
unintentional
heat
of
the
moment
had
set
fire
to
the
paraffin
with
which
that
morning
the
children
had
anointed
the
carpet
it
burned
merrily
the
children
tried
in
vain
to
stamp
it
out
they
had
to
stand
back
and
let
it
burn
itself
out
when
the
paraffin
had
burned
away
it
was
found
that
it
had
taken
with
it
all
the
darns
of
scotch
fingering
only
the
fabric
of
the
old
carpet
was
left
and
that
was
full
of
holes
come
said
the
phoenix
i
m
cool
the
four
children
got
on
to
what
was
left
of
the
carpet
very
careful
they
were
not
to
leave
a
leg
or
a
hand
hanging
over
one
of
the
holes
it
was
very
hot
the
theatre
was
a
pit
of
fire
every
one
else
had
got
out
jane
had
to
sit
on
anthea
s
lap
home
said
cyril
and
instantly
the
cool
draught
from
under
the
nursery
door
played
upon
their
legs
as
they
sat
they
were
all
on
the
carpet
still
and
the
carpet
was
lying
in
its
proper
place
on
the
nursery
floor
as
calm
and
unmoved
as
though
it
had
never
been
to
the
theatre
or
taken
part
in
a
fire
in
its
life
four
long
breaths
of
deep
relief
were
instantly
breathed
the
draught
which
they
had
never
liked
before
was
for
the
moment
quite
pleasant
and
they
were
safe
and
every
one
else
was
safe
the
theatre
had
been
quite
empty
when
they
left
every
one
was
sure
of
that
they
presently
found
themselves
all
talking
at
once
somehow
none
of
their
adventures
had
given
them
so
much
to
talk
about
none
other
had
seemed
so
real
did
you
notice
they
said
and
do
you
remember
when
suddenly
anthea
s
face
turned
pale
under
the
dirt
which
it
had
collected
on
it
during
the
fire
oh
she
cried
mother
and
father
oh
how
awful
they
ll
think
we
re
burned
to
cinders
oh
let
s
go
this
minute
and
tell
them
we
aren
we
should
only
miss
them
said
the
sensible
cyril
well
you
go
then
said
anthea
or
i
will
only
do
wash
your
face
first
mother
will
be
sure
to
think
you
are
burnt
to
a
cinder
if
she
sees
you
as
black
as
that
and
she
ll
faint
or
be
ill
or
something
oh
i
wish
we
d
never
got
to
know
that
hush
said
robert
it
s
no
use
being
rude
to
the
bird
i
suppose
it
can
t
help
its
nature
perhaps
we
d
better
wash
too
now
i
come
to
think
of
it
my
hands
are
rather
no
one
had
noticed
the
phoenix
since
it
had
bidden
them
to
step
on
the
carpet
and
no
one
noticed
that
no
one
had
noticed
all
were
partially
clean
and
cyril
was
just
plunging
into
his
to
go
and
look
for
his
parents
he
and
not
unjustly
called
it
looking
for
a
needle
in
a
bundle
of
hay
when
the
sound
of
father
s
latchkey
in
the
front
door
sent
every
one
bounding
up
the
stairs
are
you
all
safe
cried
mother
s
voice
are
you
all
safe
and
the
next
moment
she
was
kneeling
on
the
linoleum
of
the
hall
trying
to
kiss
four
damp
children
at
once
and
laughing
and
crying
by
turns
while
father
stood
looking
on
and
saying
he
was
blessed
or
something
but
how
did
you
guess
we
d
come
home
said
cyril
later
when
every
one
was
calm
enough
for
talking
well
it
was
rather
a
rum
thing
we
heard
the
garrick
was
on
fire
and
of
course
we
went
straight
there
said
father
briskly
we
couldn
t
find
you
of
course
and
we
couldn
t
get
in
but
the
firemen
told
us
every
one
was
safely
out
and
then
i
heard
a
voice
at
my
ear
say
cyril
anthea
robert
and
jane
and
something
touched
me
on
the
shoulder
it
was
a
great
yellow
pigeon
and
it
got
in
the
way
of
my
seeing
who
d
spoken
it
fluttered
off
and
then
some
one
said
in
the
other
ear
they
re
safe
at
home
and
when
i
turned
again
to
see
who
it
was
speaking
hanged
if
there
wasn
t
that
confounded
pigeon
on
my
other
shoulder
dazed
by
the
fire
i
suppose
your
mother
said
it
was
the
voice
of
i
said
it
was
the
bird
that
spoke
said
mother
and
so
it
was
or
at
least
i
thought
so
then
it
wasn
t
a
pigeon
it
was
an
cockatoo
i
don
t
care
who
it
was
that
spoke
it
was
true
and
you
re
mother
began
to
cry
again
and
father
said
bed
was
a
good
place
after
the
pleasures
of
the
stage
so
every
one
went
there
robert
had
a
talk
to
the
phoenix
that
night
oh
very
well
said
the
bird
when
robert
had
said
what
he
felt
didn
t
you
know
that
i
had
power
over
fire
do
not
distress
yourself
i
like
my
high
priests
in
lombard
street
can
undo
the
work
of
flames
kindly
open
the
it
flew
out
that
was
why
the
papers
said
next
day
that
the
fire
at
the
theatre
had
done
less
damage
than
had
been
anticipated
as
a
matter
of
fact
it
had
done
none
for
the
phoenix
spent
the
night
in
putting
things
straight
how
the
management
accounted
for
this
and
how
many
of
the
theatre
officials
still
believe
that
they
were
mad
on
that
night
will
never
be
known
next
day
mother
saw
the
burnt
holes
in
the
carpet
it
caught
where
it
was
paraffiny
said
anthea
i
must
get
rid
of
that
carpet
at
once
said
mother
but
what
the
children
said
in
sad
whispers
to
each
other
as
they
pondered
over
last
night
s
events
was
we
must
get
rid
of
that
chapter
the
end
of
the
end
egg
toast
tea
milk
and
saucer
knife
butter
that
s
all
i
think
remarked
anthea
as
she
put
the
last
touches
to
mother
s
and
went
very
carefully
up
the
stairs
feeling
for
every
step
with
her
toes
and
holding
on
to
the
tray
with
all
her
fingers
she
crept
into
mother
s
room
and
set
the
tray
on
a
chair
then
she
pulled
one
of
the
blinds
up
very
softly
is
your
head
better
mammy
dear
she
asked
in
the
soft
little
voice
that
she
kept
expressly
for
mother
s
headaches
i
ve
brought
your
brekkie
and
i
ve
put
the
little
cloth
with
on
it
the
one
i
made
that
s
very
nice
said
mother
sleepily
anthea
knew
exactly
what
to
do
for
mothers
with
headaches
who
had
breakfast
in
bed
she
fetched
warm
water
and
put
just
enough
eau
de
cologne
in
it
and
bathed
mother
s
face
and
hands
with
the
water
then
mother
was
able
to
think
about
breakfast
but
what
s
the
matter
with
my
girl
she
asked
when
her
eyes
got
used
to
the
light
oh
i
m
so
sorry
you
re
ill
anthea
said
it
s
that
horrible
fire
and
you
being
so
frightened
father
said
so
and
we
all
feel
as
if
it
was
our
faults
i
can
t
explain
but
it
wasn
t
your
fault
a
bit
you
darling
goosie
mother
said
how
could
it
be
that
s
just
what
i
can
t
tell
you
said
anthea
i
haven
t
got
a
futile
brain
like
you
and
father
to
think
of
ways
of
explaining
mother
laughed
my
futile
brain
or
did
you
mean
fertile
anyway
it
feels
very
stiff
and
sore
this
morning
but
i
shall
be
quite
all
right
by
and
by
and
don
t
be
a
silly
little
pet
girl
the
fire
wasn
t
your
faults
no
i
don
t
want
the
egg
dear
i
ll
go
to
sleep
again
i
think
don
t
you
worry
and
tell
cook
not
to
bother
me
about
meals
you
can
order
what
you
like
for
anthea
closed
the
door
very
mousily
and
instantly
went
downstairs
and
ordered
what
she
liked
for
lunch
she
ordered
a
pair
of
turkeys
a
large
and
almonds
and
raisins
cook
told
her
to
go
along
do
and
she
might
as
well
not
have
ordered
anything
for
when
lunch
came
it
was
just
hashed
mutton
and
semolina
pudding
and
cook
had
forgotten
the
sippets
for
the
mutton
hash
and
the
semolina
pudding
was
burnt
when
anthea
rejoined
the
others
she
found
them
all
plunged
in
the
gloom
where
she
was
herself
for
every
one
knew
that
the
days
of
the
carpet
were
now
numbered
indeed
so
worn
was
it
that
you
could
almost
have
numbered
its
threads
so
that
now
after
nearly
a
month
of
magic
happenings
the
time
was
at
hand
when
life
would
have
to
go
on
in
the
dull
ordinary
way
and
jane
robert
anthea
and
cyril
would
be
just
in
the
same
position
as
the
other
children
who
live
in
camden
town
the
children
whom
these
four
had
so
often
pitied
and
perhaps
a
little
despised
we
shall
be
just
like
them
cyril
said
except
said
robert
that
we
shall
have
more
things
to
remember
and
be
sorry
we
haven
t
mother
s
going
to
send
away
the
carpet
as
soon
as
she
s
well
enough
to
see
about
that
coconut
matting
fancy
us
with
us
and
we
ve
walked
under
live
on
the
island
where
you
can
t
have
pretty
island
said
the
lamb
sands
and
sea
all
shiny
his
brothers
and
sisters
had
often
wondered
whether
he
remembered
that
island
now
they
knew
that
he
did
yes
said
cyril
no
more
cheap
return
trips
by
carpet
for
us
that
s
a
dead
they
were
all
talking
about
the
carpet
but
what
they
were
all
thinking
about
was
the
phoenix
the
golden
bird
had
been
so
kind
so
friendly
so
polite
so
instructive
and
now
it
had
set
fire
to
a
theatre
and
made
mother
nobody
blamed
the
bird
it
had
acted
in
a
perfectly
natural
manner
but
every
one
saw
that
it
must
not
be
asked
to
prolong
its
visit
indeed
in
plain
english
it
must
be
asked
to
go
the
four
children
felt
like
base
spies
and
treacherous
friends
and
each
in
its
mind
was
saying
who
ought
not
to
be
the
one
to
tell
the
phoenix
that
there
could
no
longer
be
a
place
for
it
in
that
happy
home
in
camden
town
each
child
was
quite
sure
that
one
of
them
ought
to
speak
out
in
a
fair
and
manly
way
but
nobody
wanted
to
be
the
one
they
could
not
talk
the
whole
thing
over
as
they
would
have
liked
to
do
because
the
phoenix
itself
was
in
the
cupboard
among
the
blackbeetles
and
the
odd
shoes
and
the
broken
chessmen
but
anthea
tried
it
s
very
horrid
i
do
hate
thinking
things
about
people
and
not
being
able
to
say
the
things
you
re
thinking
because
of
the
way
they
would
feel
when
they
thought
what
things
you
were
thinking
and
wondered
what
they
d
done
to
make
you
think
things
like
that
and
why
you
were
thinking
anthea
was
so
anxious
that
the
phoenix
should
not
understand
what
she
said
that
she
made
a
speech
completely
baffling
to
all
it
was
not
till
she
pointed
to
the
cupboard
in
which
all
believed
the
phoenix
to
be
that
cyril
understood
yes
he
said
while
jane
and
robert
were
trying
to
tell
each
other
how
deeply
they
didn
t
understand
what
anthea
were
saying
but
after
recent
eventfulnesses
a
new
leaf
has
to
be
turned
over
and
after
all
mother
is
more
important
than
the
feelings
of
any
of
the
lower
forms
of
creation
however
how
beautifully
you
do
do
it
said
anthea
absently
beginning
to
build
a
for
the
lamb
mixing
up
what
you
re
saying
i
mean
we
ought
to
practise
doing
it
so
as
to
be
ready
for
mysterious
occasions
we
re
talking
about
that
she
said
to
jane
and
robert
frowning
and
nodding
towards
the
cupboard
where
the
phoenix
was
then
robert
and
jane
understood
and
each
opened
its
mouth
to
speak
wait
a
minute
said
anthea
quickly
the
game
is
to
twist
up
what
you
want
to
say
so
that
no
one
can
understand
what
you
re
saying
except
the
people
you
want
to
understand
it
and
sometimes
not
the
ancient
philosophers
said
a
golden
voice
well
understood
the
art
of
which
you
of
course
it
was
the
phoenix
who
had
not
been
in
the
cupboard
at
all
but
had
been
cocking
a
golden
eye
at
them
from
the
cornice
during
the
whole
conversation
pretty
dickie
remarked
the
lamb
canary
dickie
poor
misguided
infant
said
the
phoenix
there
was
a
painful
pause
the
four
could
not
but
think
it
likely
that
the
phoenix
had
understood
their
very
veiled
allusions
accompanied
as
they
had
been
by
gestures
indicating
the
cupboard
for
the
phoenix
was
not
wanting
in
intelligence
we
were
just
saying
cyril
began
and
i
hope
he
was
not
going
to
say
anything
but
the
truth
whatever
it
was
he
did
not
say
it
for
the
phoenix
interrupted
him
and
all
breathed
more
freely
as
it
spoke
i
gather
it
said
that
you
have
some
tidings
of
a
fatal
nature
to
communicate
to
our
degraded
black
brothers
who
run
to
and
fro
for
ever
it
pointed
a
claw
at
the
cupboard
where
the
blackbeetles
lived
canary
talk
said
the
lamb
joyously
go
and
show
he
wriggled
off
anthea
s
lap
mammy
s
asleep
said
jane
hastily
come
and
be
wild
beasts
in
a
cage
under
the
but
the
lamb
caught
his
feet
and
hands
and
even
his
head
so
often
and
so
deeply
in
the
holes
of
the
carpet
that
the
cage
or
table
had
to
be
moved
on
to
the
linoleum
and
the
carpet
lay
bare
to
sight
with
all
its
horrid
holes
ah
said
the
bird
it
isn
t
long
for
this
no
said
robert
everything
comes
to
an
end
it
s
sometimes
the
end
is
peace
remarked
the
phoenix
i
imagine
that
unless
it
comes
soon
the
end
of
your
carpet
will
be
yes
said
cyril
respectfully
kicking
what
was
left
of
the
carpet
the
movement
of
its
bright
colours
caught
the
eye
of
the
lamb
who
went
down
on
all
fours
instantly
and
began
to
pull
at
the
red
and
blue
threads
aggedydaggedygaggedy
murmured
the
lamb
daggedy
ag
ag
ag
and
before
any
one
could
have
winked
even
if
they
had
wanted
to
and
it
would
not
have
been
of
the
slightest
use
the
middle
of
the
floor
showed
bare
an
island
of
boards
surrounded
by
a
sea
of
linoleum
the
magic
carpet
was
gone
and
so
was
the
lamb
there
was
a
horrible
silence
the
lamb
the
baby
all
alone
had
been
wafted
away
on
that
untrustworthy
carpet
so
full
of
holes
and
magic
and
no
one
could
know
where
he
was
and
no
one
could
follow
him
because
there
was
now
no
carpet
to
follow
on
jane
burst
into
tears
but
anthea
though
pale
and
frantic
was
it
must
be
a
dream
she
said
that
s
what
the
clergyman
said
remarked
robert
forlornly
but
it
wasn
t
and
it
isn
but
the
lamb
never
wished
said
cyril
he
was
only
talking
the
carpet
understands
all
speech
said
the
phoenix
even
bosh
i
know
not
this
boshland
but
be
assured
that
its
tongue
is
not
unknown
to
the
do
you
mean
then
said
anthea
in
white
terror
that
when
he
was
saying
agglety
dag
or
whatever
it
was
that
he
meant
something
by
it
all
speech
has
meaning
said
the
phoenix
there
i
think
you
re
wrong
said
cyril
even
people
who
talk
english
sometimes
say
things
that
don
t
mean
anything
in
oh
never
mind
that
now
moaned
anthea
you
think
aggety
dag
meant
something
to
him
and
the
carpet
beyond
doubt
it
held
the
same
meaning
to
the
carpet
as
to
the
luckless
infant
the
phoenix
said
calmly
and
what
did
it
mean
oh
what
unfortunately
the
bird
rejoined
i
never
studied
jane
sobbed
noisily
but
the
others
were
calm
with
what
is
sometimes
called
the
calmness
of
despair
the
lamb
was
gone
the
lamb
their
own
precious
baby
brother
who
had
never
in
his
happy
little
life
been
for
a
moment
out
of
the
sight
of
eyes
that
loved
him
he
was
gone
he
had
gone
alone
into
the
great
world
with
no
other
companion
and
protector
than
a
carpet
with
holes
in
it
the
children
had
never
really
understood
before
what
an
enormously
big
place
the
world
is
and
the
lamb
might
be
anywhere
in
it
and
it
s
no
use
going
to
look
for
cyril
in
flat
and
wretched
tones
only
said
what
the
others
were
thinking
do
you
wish
him
to
return
the
phoenix
asked
it
seemed
to
speak
with
some
surprise
of
course
we
do
cried
everybody
isn
t
he
more
trouble
than
he
s
worth
asked
the
bird
doubtfully
no
no
oh
we
do
want
him
back
we
do
then
said
the
wearer
of
gold
plumage
if
you
ll
excuse
me
i
ll
just
pop
out
and
see
what
i
can
cyril
flung
open
the
window
and
the
phoenix
popped
out
oh
if
only
mother
goes
on
sleeping
oh
suppose
she
wakes
up
and
wants
the
lamb
oh
suppose
the
servants
come
stop
crying
jane
it
s
no
earthly
good
no
i
m
not
crying
myself
at
least
i
wasn
t
till
you
said
so
and
i
shouldn
t
anyway
if
if
there
was
any
mortal
thing
we
could
do
oh
oh
oh
cyril
and
robert
were
boys
and
boys
never
cry
of
course
still
the
position
was
a
terrible
one
and
i
do
not
wonder
that
they
made
faces
in
their
efforts
to
behave
in
a
really
manly
way
and
at
this
awful
moment
mother
s
bell
rang
a
breathless
stillness
held
the
children
then
anthea
dried
her
eyes
she
looked
round
her
and
caught
up
the
poker
she
held
it
out
to
cyril
hit
my
hand
hard
she
said
i
must
show
mother
some
reason
for
my
eyes
being
like
they
are
harder
she
cried
as
cyril
gently
tapped
her
with
the
iron
handle
and
cyril
agitated
and
trembling
nerved
himself
to
hit
harder
and
hit
very
much
harder
than
he
intended
anthea
screamed
oh
panther
i
didn
t
mean
to
hurt
really
cried
cyril
clattering
the
poker
back
into
the
fender
it
s
all
right
said
anthea
breathlessly
clasping
the
hurt
hand
with
the
one
that
wasn
t
hurt
it
s
getting
it
was
a
round
red
and
blue
bump
was
rising
on
the
back
of
it
now
robert
she
said
trying
to
breathe
more
evenly
you
go
out
oh
i
don
t
know
where
on
to
the
dustbin
anywhere
and
i
shall
tell
mother
you
and
the
lamb
are
anthea
was
now
ready
to
deceive
her
mother
for
as
long
as
ever
she
could
deceit
is
very
wrong
we
know
but
it
seemed
to
anthea
that
it
was
her
plain
duty
to
keep
her
mother
from
being
frightened
about
the
lamb
as
long
as
possible
and
the
phoenix
might
help
it
always
has
helped
robert
said
it
got
us
out
of
the
tower
and
even
when
it
made
the
fire
in
the
theatre
it
got
us
out
all
right
i
m
certain
it
will
manage
mother
s
bell
rang
again
oh
eliza
s
never
answered
it
cried
anthea
she
never
does
oh
i
must
and
she
went
her
heart
beat
bumpingly
as
she
climbed
the
stairs
mother
would
be
certain
to
notice
her
eyes
well
her
hand
would
account
for
that
but
the
lamb
no
i
must
not
think
of
the
lamb
she
said
to
herself
and
bit
her
tongue
till
her
eyes
watered
again
so
as
to
give
herself
something
else
to
think
of
her
arms
and
legs
and
back
and
even
her
face
felt
stiff
with
her
resolution
not
to
let
mother
be
worried
if
she
could
help
it
she
opened
the
door
softly
yes
mother
she
said
dearest
said
mother
the
lamb
anthea
tried
to
be
brave
she
tried
to
say
that
the
lamb
and
robert
were
out
perhaps
she
tried
too
hard
anyway
when
she
opened
her
mouth
no
words
came
so
she
stood
with
it
open
it
seemed
easier
to
keep
from
crying
with
one
s
mouth
in
that
unusual
position
the
lamb
mother
went
on
he
was
very
good
at
first
but
he
s
pulled
the
off
the
with
all
the
brushes
and
pots
and
things
and
now
he
s
so
quiet
i
m
sure
he
s
in
some
dreadful
mischief
and
i
can
t
see
him
from
here
and
if
i
d
got
out
of
bed
to
see
i
m
sure
i
should
have
do
you
mean
he
s
here
said
anthea
of
course
he
s
here
said
mother
a
little
impatiently
where
did
you
think
he
was
anthea
went
round
the
foot
of
the
big
mahogany
bed
there
was
a
pause
he
s
not
here
now
she
said
that
he
had
been
there
was
plain
from
the
on
the
floor
the
scattered
pots
and
bottles
the
wandering
brushes
and
combs
all
involved
in
the
tangle
of
ribbons
and
laces
which
an
open
drawer
had
yielded
to
the
baby
s
inquisitive
fingers
he
must
have
crept
out
then
said
mother
do
keep
him
with
you
there
s
a
darling
if
i
don
t
get
some
sleep
i
shall
be
a
wreck
when
father
comes
anthea
closed
the
door
softly
then
she
tore
downstairs
and
burst
into
the
nursery
crying
he
must
have
wished
he
was
with
mother
he
s
been
there
all
the
time
aggety
dag
the
unusual
word
was
frozen
on
her
lip
as
people
say
in
books
for
there
on
the
floor
lay
the
carpet
and
on
the
carpet
surrounded
by
his
brothers
and
by
jane
sat
the
lamb
he
had
covered
his
face
and
clothes
with
vaseline
and
violet
powder
but
he
was
easily
recognizable
in
spite
of
this
disguise
you
are
right
said
the
phoenix
who
was
also
present
it
is
evident
that
as
you
say
aggety
dag
is
bosh
for
i
want
to
be
where
my
mother
is
and
so
the
faithful
carpet
understood
but
how
said
anthea
catching
up
the
lamb
and
hugging
him
how
did
he
get
back
here
oh
said
the
phoenix
i
flew
to
the
psammead
and
wished
that
your
infant
brother
were
restored
to
your
midst
and
immediately
it
was
oh
i
am
glad
i
am
glad
cried
anthea
still
hugging
the
baby
oh
you
darling
shut
up
jane
i
don
t
care
how
much
he
comes
off
on
me
cyril
you
and
robert
roll
that
carpet
up
and
put
it
in
the
he
might
say
aggety
dag
again
and
it
might
mean
something
quite
different
next
time
now
my
lamb
panther
ll
clean
you
a
little
come
i
hope
the
beetles
won
t
go
wishing
said
cyril
as
they
rolled
up
the
carpet
two
days
later
mother
was
well
enough
to
go
out
and
that
evening
the
coconut
matting
came
home
the
children
had
talked
and
talked
and
thought
and
thought
but
they
had
not
found
any
polite
way
of
telling
the
phoenix
that
they
did
not
want
it
to
stay
any
longer
the
days
had
been
days
spent
by
the
children
in
embarrassment
and
by
the
phoenix
in
sleep
and
now
the
matting
was
laid
down
the
phoenix
awoke
and
fluttered
down
on
to
it
it
shook
its
crested
head
i
like
not
this
carpet
it
said
it
is
harsh
and
unyielding
and
it
hurts
my
golden
we
ve
jolly
well
got
to
get
used
to
its
hurting
our
golden
feet
said
cyril
this
then
said
the
bird
supersedes
the
wishing
yes
said
robert
if
you
mean
that
it
s
instead
of
and
the
magic
web
inquired
the
phoenix
with
sudden
eagerness
it
s
the
man
s
day
said
anthea
in
a
low
voice
he
will
take
it
the
phoenix
fluttered
up
to
its
favourite
perch
on
the
hear
me
it
cried
oh
youthful
children
of
men
and
restrain
your
tears
of
misery
and
despair
for
what
must
be
must
be
and
i
would
not
remember
you
thousands
of
years
hence
as
base
ingrates
and
crawling
worms
compact
of
low
i
should
hope
not
indeed
said
cyril
weep
not
the
bird
went
on
i
really
do
beg
that
you
won
t
weep
i
will
not
seek
to
break
the
news
to
you
gently
let
the
blow
fall
at
once
the
time
has
come
when
i
must
leave
all
four
children
breathed
forth
a
long
sigh
of
relief
we
needn
t
have
bothered
so
about
how
to
break
the
news
to
it
whispered
cyril
ah
sigh
not
so
said
the
bird
gently
all
meetings
end
in
partings
i
must
leave
you
i
have
sought
to
prepare
you
for
this
ah
do
not
give
way
must
you
really
go
so
soon
murmured
anthea
it
was
what
she
had
often
heard
her
mother
say
to
calling
ladies
in
the
afternoon
i
must
really
thank
you
so
much
dear
replied
the
bird
just
as
though
it
had
been
one
of
the
ladies
i
am
weary
it
went
on
i
desire
to
rest
after
all
the
happenings
of
this
last
moon
i
do
desire
really
to
rest
and
i
ask
of
you
one
last
any
little
thing
we
can
do
said
robert
now
that
it
had
really
come
to
parting
with
the
phoenix
whose
favourite
he
had
always
been
robert
did
feel
almost
as
miserable
as
the
phoenix
thought
they
all
did
i
ask
but
the
relic
designed
for
the
man
give
me
what
is
left
of
the
carpet
and
let
me
dare
we
said
anthea
would
mother
mind
i
have
dared
greatly
for
your
sakes
remarked
the
bird
well
then
we
will
said
robert
the
phoenix
fluffed
out
its
feathers
joyously
nor
shall
you
regret
it
children
of
golden
hearts
it
said
quick
spread
the
carpet
and
leave
me
alone
but
first
pile
high
the
fire
then
while
i
am
immersed
in
the
sacred
preliminary
rites
do
ye
prepare
woods
and
spices
for
the
last
act
of
the
children
spread
out
what
was
left
of
the
carpet
and
after
all
though
this
was
just
what
they
would
have
wished
to
have
happened
all
hearts
were
sad
then
they
put
half
a
scuttle
of
coal
on
the
fire
and
went
out
closing
the
door
on
the
phoenix
left
at
last
alone
with
the
carpet
one
of
us
must
keep
watch
said
robert
excitedly
as
soon
as
they
were
all
out
of
the
room
and
the
others
can
go
and
buy
sweet
woods
and
spices
get
the
very
best
that
money
can
buy
and
plenty
of
them
don
t
let
s
stand
to
a
threepence
or
so
i
want
it
to
have
a
jolly
good
it
s
the
only
thing
that
ll
make
us
feel
less
horrid
it
was
felt
that
robert
as
the
pet
of
the
phoenix
ought
to
have
the
last
melancholy
pleasure
of
choosing
the
materials
for
its
funeral
pyre
i
ll
keep
watch
if
you
like
said
cyril
i
don
t
mind
and
besides
it
s
raining
hard
and
my
boots
let
in
the
wet
you
might
call
and
see
if
my
other
ones
are
really
reliable
again
so
they
left
cyril
standing
like
a
roman
sentinel
outside
the
door
inside
which
the
phoenix
was
getting
ready
for
the
great
change
and
they
all
went
out
to
buy
the
precious
things
for
the
last
sad
rites
robert
is
right
anthea
said
this
is
no
time
for
being
careful
about
our
money
let
s
go
to
the
stationer
s
first
and
buy
a
whole
packet
of
they
re
cheaper
if
you
buy
them
by
the
this
was
a
thing
that
they
had
always
wanted
to
do
but
it
needed
the
great
excitement
of
a
funeral
pyre
and
a
parting
from
a
beloved
phoenix
to
screw
them
up
to
the
extravagance
the
people
at
the
stationer
s
said
that
the
pencils
were
real
so
i
hope
they
were
for
stationers
should
always
speak
the
truth
at
any
rate
they
cost
also
they
spent
sevenpence
on
a
little
box
inlaid
with
ivory
because
said
anthea
i
know
sandalwood
smells
sweet
and
when
it
s
burned
it
smells
very
sweet
ivory
doesn
t
smell
at
all
said
robert
but
i
expect
when
you
burn
it
it
smells
most
awful
vile
like
at
the
grocer
s
they
bought
all
the
spices
they
could
remember
the
names
of
mace
cloves
like
blunt
nails
peppercorns
the
long
and
the
round
kind
ginger
the
dry
sort
of
course
and
the
beautiful
shells
of
fragrant
cinnamon
allspice
too
and
caraway
seeds
caraway
seeds
that
smelt
most
deadly
when
the
time
came
for
burning
them
camphor
and
oil
of
lavender
were
bought
at
the
chemist
s
and
also
a
little
scent
sachet
labelled
violettes
de
parme
they
took
the
things
home
and
found
cyril
still
on
guard
when
they
had
knocked
and
the
golden
voice
of
the
phoenix
had
said
come
in
they
went
in
there
lay
the
carpet
or
what
was
left
of
it
and
on
it
lay
an
egg
exactly
like
the
one
out
of
which
the
phoenix
had
been
hatched
the
phoenix
was
walking
round
and
round
the
egg
clucking
with
joy
and
pride
i
ve
laid
it
you
see
it
said
and
as
fine
an
egg
as
ever
i
laid
in
all
my
born
every
one
said
yes
it
was
indeed
a
beauty
the
things
which
the
children
had
bought
were
now
taken
out
of
their
papers
and
arranged
on
the
table
and
when
the
phoenix
had
been
persuaded
to
leave
its
egg
for
a
moment
and
look
at
the
materials
for
its
last
fire
it
was
quite
overcome
never
never
have
i
had
a
finer
pyre
than
this
will
be
you
shall
not
regret
it
it
said
wiping
away
a
golden
tear
write
quickly
go
and
tell
the
psammead
to
fulfil
the
last
wish
of
the
phoenix
and
return
instantly
but
robert
wished
to
be
polite
and
he
wrote
please
go
and
ask
the
psammead
to
be
so
kind
as
to
fulfil
the
phoenix
s
last
wish
and
come
straight
back
if
you
the
paper
was
pinned
to
the
carpet
which
vanished
and
returned
in
the
flash
of
an
eye
then
another
paper
was
written
ordering
the
carpet
to
take
the
egg
somewhere
where
it
wouldn
t
be
hatched
for
another
two
thousand
years
the
phoenix
tore
itself
away
from
its
cherished
egg
which
it
watched
with
yearning
tenderness
till
the
paper
being
pinned
on
the
carpet
hastily
rolled
itself
up
round
the
egg
and
both
vanished
for
ever
from
the
nursery
of
the
house
in
camden
town
oh
dear
oh
dear
oh
dear
said
everybody
bear
up
said
the
bird
do
you
think
don
t
suffer
being
parted
from
my
precious
egg
like
this
come
conquer
your
emotions
and
build
my
oh
cried
robert
suddenly
and
wholly
breaking
down
i
can
t
bear
you
to
go
the
phoenix
perched
on
his
shoulder
and
rubbed
its
beak
softly
against
his
ear
the
sorrows
of
youth
soon
appear
but
as
dreams
it
said
farewell
robert
of
my
heart
i
have
loved
you
the
fire
had
burnt
to
a
red
glow
one
by
one
the
spices
and
sweet
woods
were
laid
on
it
some
smelt
nice
and
some
the
caraway
seeds
and
the
violettes
de
parme
sachet
among
them
smelt
worse
than
you
would
think
possible
farewell
farewell
farewell
farewell
said
the
phoenix
in
a
voice
oh
said
every
one
and
now
all
were
in
tears
the
bright
bird
fluttered
seven
times
round
the
room
and
settled
in
the
hot
heart
of
the
fire
the
sweet
gums
and
spices
and
woods
flared
and
flickered
around
it
but
its
golden
feathers
did
not
burn
it
seemed
to
grow
to
the
very
inside
heart
of
it
and
then
before
the
eight
eyes
of
its
friends
it
fell
together
a
heap
of
white
ashes
and
the
flames
of
the
cedar
pencils
and
the
box
met
and
joined
above
it
whatever
have
you
done
with
the
carpet
asked
mother
next
day
we
gave
it
to
some
one
who
wanted
it
very
much
the
name
began
with
a
p
said
jane
the
others
instantly
hushed
her
oh
well
it
wasn
t
worth
twopence
said
mother
the
person
who
began
with
p
said
we
shouldn
t
lose
by
it
jane
went
on
before
she
could
be
stopped
i
daresay
said
mother
laughing
but
that
very
night
a
great
box
came
addressed
to
the
children
by
all
their
names
eliza
never
could
remember
the
name
of
the
carrier
who
brought
it
it
wasn
t
carter
paterson
or
the
parcels
delivery
it
was
instantly
opened
it
was
a
big
wooden
box
and
it
had
to
be
opened
with
a
hammer
and
the
kitchen
poker
the
long
nails
came
squeaking
out
and
boards
scrunched
as
they
were
wrenched
off
inside
the
box
was
soft
paper
with
beautiful
chinese
patterns
on
it
blue
and
green
and
red
and
violet
and
under
the
paper
well
almost
everything
lovely
that
you
can
think
of
everything
of
reasonable
size
i
mean
for
of
course
there
were
no
motors
or
flying
machines
or
thoroughbred
chargers
but
there
really
was
almost
everything
else
everything
that
the
children
had
always
wanted
toys
and
games
and
books
and
chocolate
and
candied
cherries
and
and
photographic
cameras
and
all
the
presents
they
had
always
wanted
to
give
to
father
and
mother
and
the
lamb
only
they
had
never
had
the
money
for
them
at
the
very
bottom
of
the
box
was
a
tiny
golden
feather
no
one
saw
it
but
robert
and
he
picked
it
up
and
hid
it
in
the
breast
of
his
jacket
which
had
been
so
often
the
of
the
golden
bird
when
he
went
to
bed
the
feather
was
gone
it
was
the
last
he
ever
saw
of
the
phoenix
pinned
to
the
lovely
fur
cloak
that
mother
had
always
wanted
was
a
paper
and
it
said
in
return
for
the
carpet
with
you
may
guess
how
father
and
mother
talked
it
over
they
decided
at
last
the
person
who
had
had
the
carpet
and
whom
curiously
enough
the
children
were
quite
unable
to
describe
must
be
an
insane
millionaire
who
amused
himself
by
playing
at
being
a
man
but
the
children
knew
better
they
knew
that
this
was
the
fulfilment
by
the
powerful
psammead
of
the
last
wish
of
the
phoenix
and
that
this
glorious
and
delightful
boxful
of
treasures
was
really
the
very
very
very
end
of
the
phoenix
and
the
carpet
