introduction
the
last
abbot
of
whalley
chapter
the
beacon
on
pendle
hill
there
were
eight
watchers
by
the
beacon
on
pendle
hill
in
lancashire
two
were
stationed
on
either
side
of
the
extremity
of
the
mountain
one
looked
over
the
castled
heights
of
clithero
the
woody
eminences
of
bowland
the
bleak
ridges
of
thornley
the
broad
moors
of
bleasdale
the
trough
of
bolland
and
wolf
crag
and
even
brought
within
his
ken
the
black
fells
overhanging
lancaster
the
other
tracked
the
stream
called
pendle
water
almost
from
its
source
amid
the
neighbouring
hills
and
followed
its
windings
through
the
leafless
forest
until
it
united
its
waters
to
those
of
the
calder
and
swept
on
in
swifter
and
clearer
current
to
wash
the
base
of
whalley
abbey
but
the
survey
did
not
stop
here
noting
the
sharp
spire
of
burnley
church
relieved
against
the
rounded
masses
of
timber
constituting
townley
park
as
well
as
the
entrance
of
the
gloomy
mountain
gorge
known
as
the
grange
of
cliviger
his
gaze
passed
over
todmorden
and
settled
upon
the
distant
summits
of
blackstone
edge
dreary
was
the
prospect
on
all
sides
black
moor
bleak
fell
straggling
forest
intersected
with
sullen
streams
as
black
as
ink
with
here
and
there
a
small
tarn
or
with
waters
of
the
same
hue
these
constituted
the
chief
features
of
the
scene
the
whole
district
was
barren
and
of
towns
only
clithero
colne
and
burnley
the
latter
little
more
than
a
village
were
in
view
in
the
valleys
there
were
a
few
hamlets
and
scattered
cottages
and
on
the
uplands
an
occasional
booth
as
the
hut
of
the
herdsman
was
termed
but
of
more
important
mansions
there
were
only
six
as
merley
twistleton
alcancoats
saxfeld
ightenhill
and
gawthorpe
the
vaccaries
for
the
cattle
of
which
the
herdsmen
had
the
care
and
the
lawnds
or
parks
within
the
forest
appertaining
to
some
of
the
halls
before
mentioned
offered
the
only
evidences
of
cultivation
all
else
was
heathy
waste
morass
and
wood
still
in
the
eye
of
the
sportsman
and
the
lancashire
gentlemen
of
the
sixteenth
century
were
keen
lovers
of
sport
the
country
had
a
strong
interest
pendle
forest
abounded
with
game
grouse
plover
and
bittern
were
found
upon
its
moors
woodcock
and
snipe
on
its
marshes
mallard
teal
and
widgeon
upon
its
pools
in
its
chases
ranged
herds
of
deer
protected
by
the
terrible
then
in
full
force
and
the
hardier
huntsman
might
follow
the
wolf
to
his
lair
in
the
mountains
might
spear
the
boar
in
the
oaken
glades
or
the
otter
on
the
brink
might
unearth
the
badger
or
the
fox
or
smite
the
fierce
with
a
quarrel
from
his
bow
a
nobler
victim
sometimes
also
awaited
him
in
the
shape
of
a
wild
mountain
bull
a
denizen
of
the
forest
and
a
remnant
of
the
herds
that
had
once
browsed
upon
the
hills
but
which
had
almost
all
been
captured
and
removed
to
stock
the
park
of
the
abbot
of
whalley
the
streams
and
pools
were
full
of
fish
the
stately
heron
frequented
the
meres
and
on
the
craggy
heights
built
the
kite
the
falcon
and
the
kingly
eagle
there
were
eight
watchers
by
the
beacon
two
stood
apart
from
the
others
looking
to
the
right
and
the
left
of
the
hill
both
were
armed
with
swords
and
arquebuses
and
wore
steel
caps
and
coats
of
buff
their
sleeves
were
embroidered
with
the
five
wounds
of
christ
encircling
the
name
of
jesus
the
badge
of
the
pilgrimage
of
grace
between
them
on
the
verge
of
the
mountain
was
planted
a
great
banner
displaying
a
silver
cross
the
chalice
and
the
host
together
with
an
ecclesiastical
figure
but
wearing
a
helmet
instead
of
a
mitre
and
holding
a
sword
in
place
of
a
crosier
with
the
unoccupied
hand
pointing
to
the
two
towers
of
a
monastic
structure
as
if
to
intimate
that
he
was
armed
for
its
defence
this
figure
as
the
device
beneath
it
showed
represented
john
paslew
abbot
of
whalley
or
as
he
styled
himself
in
his
military
capacity
earl
of
poverty
there
were
eight
watchers
by
the
beacon
two
have
been
described
of
the
other
six
two
were
stout
herdsmen
carrying
crooks
and
holding
a
couple
of
mules
and
a
by
the
bridle
near
them
stood
a
athletic
young
man
with
the
fresh
complexion
curling
brown
hair
light
eyes
and
open
saxon
countenance
best
seen
in
his
native
county
of
lancaster
he
wore
a
tunic
with
a
bugle
suspended
from
the
shoulder
by
a
silken
cord
and
a
silver
plate
engraved
with
the
three
luces
the
ensign
of
the
abbot
of
whalley
hung
by
a
chain
from
his
neck
a
hunting
knife
was
in
his
girdle
and
an
eagle
plume
in
his
cap
and
he
leaned
upon
the
of
a
crossbow
regarding
three
persons
who
stood
together
by
a
peat
fire
on
the
sheltered
side
of
the
beacon
two
of
these
were
elderly
men
in
the
white
gowns
and
scapularies
of
cistertian
monks
doubtless
from
whalley
as
the
abbey
belonged
to
that
order
the
third
and
last
and
evidently
their
superior
was
a
tall
man
in
a
riding
dress
wrapped
in
a
long
mantle
of
black
velvet
trimmed
with
minever
and
displaying
the
same
badges
as
those
upon
the
sleeves
of
the
sentinels
only
wrought
in
richer
material
his
features
were
strongly
marked
and
stern
and
bore
traces
of
age
but
his
eye
was
bright
and
his
carriage
erect
and
dignified
the
beacon
near
which
the
watchers
stood
consisted
of
a
vast
pile
of
logs
of
timber
heaped
upon
a
circular
range
of
stones
with
openings
to
admit
air
and
having
the
centre
filled
with
fagots
and
other
quickly
combustible
materials
torches
were
placed
near
at
hand
so
that
the
pile
could
be
lighted
on
the
instant
the
watch
was
held
one
afternoon
at
the
latter
end
of
november
in
that
year
had
arisen
a
formidable
rebellion
in
the
northern
counties
of
england
the
members
of
which
while
engaging
to
respect
the
person
of
the
king
henry
and
his
issue
bound
themselves
by
solemn
oath
to
accomplish
the
restoration
of
papal
supremacy
throughout
the
realm
and
the
restitution
of
religious
establishments
and
lands
to
their
late
ejected
possessors
they
bound
themselves
also
to
punish
the
enemies
of
the
romish
church
and
suppress
heresy
from
its
religious
character
the
insurrection
assumed
the
name
of
the
pilgrimage
of
grace
and
numbered
among
its
adherents
all
who
had
not
embraced
the
new
doctrines
in
yorkshire
and
lancashire
that
such
an
outbreak
should
occur
on
the
suppression
of
the
monasteries
was
not
marvellous
the
desecration
and
spoliation
of
so
many
sacred
structures
the
destruction
of
shrines
and
images
long
regarded
with
veneration
the
ejection
of
so
many
ecclesiastics
renowned
for
hospitality
and
revered
for
piety
and
learning
the
violence
and
rapacity
of
the
commissioners
appointed
by
the
cromwell
to
carry
out
these
severe
measures
all
these
outrages
were
regarded
by
the
people
with
abhorrence
and
disposed
them
to
aid
the
sufferers
in
resistance
as
yet
the
wealthier
monasteries
in
the
north
had
been
spared
and
it
was
to
preserve
them
from
the
greedy
hands
of
the
visiters
doctors
lee
and
layton
that
the
insurrection
had
been
undertaken
a
simultaneous
rising
took
place
in
lincolnshire
headed
by
makarel
abbot
of
barlings
but
it
was
speedily
quelled
by
the
vigour
and
skill
of
the
duke
of
suffolk
and
its
leader
executed
but
the
northern
outbreak
was
better
organized
and
of
greater
force
for
it
now
numbered
thirty
thousand
men
under
the
command
of
a
skilful
and
resolute
leader
named
robert
aske
as
may
be
supposed
the
priesthood
were
main
movers
in
a
revolt
having
their
especial
benefit
for
its
aim
and
many
of
them
following
the
example
of
the
abbot
of
barlings
clothed
themselves
in
steel
instead
of
woollen
garments
and
girded
on
the
sword
and
the
breastplate
for
the
redress
of
their
grievances
and
the
maintenance
of
their
rights
amongst
these
were
the
abbots
of
jervaux
furness
fountains
rivaulx
and
salley
and
lastly
the
abbot
of
whalley
before
mentioned
a
fiery
and
energetic
prelate
who
had
ever
been
constant
and
determined
in
his
opposition
to
the
aggressive
measures
of
the
king
such
was
the
pilgrimage
of
grace
such
its
design
and
such
its
supporters
several
large
towns
had
already
fallen
into
the
hands
of
the
insurgents
york
hull
and
pontefract
had
yielded
skipton
castle
was
besieged
and
defended
by
the
earl
of
cumberland
and
battle
was
offered
to
the
duke
of
norfolk
and
the
earl
of
shrewsbury
who
headed
the
king
forces
at
doncaster
but
the
object
of
the
royalist
leaders
was
to
temporise
and
an
armistice
was
offered
to
the
rebels
and
accepted
terms
were
next
proposed
and
debated
during
the
continuance
of
this
armistice
all
hostilities
ceased
but
beacons
were
reared
upon
the
mountains
and
their
fires
were
to
be
taken
as
a
new
summons
to
arms
this
signal
the
eight
watchers
expected
though
late
in
november
the
day
had
been
unusually
fine
and
in
consequence
the
whole
hilly
ranges
around
were
clearly
discernible
but
now
the
shades
of
evening
were
fast
drawing
on
night
is
approaching
cried
the
tall
man
in
the
velvet
mantle
impatiently
and
still
the
signal
comes
not
wherefore
this
delay
can
norfolk
have
accepted
our
conditions
impossible
the
last
messenger
from
our
camp
at
scawsby
lees
brought
word
that
the
duke
sole
terms
would
be
the
king
pardon
to
the
whole
insurgent
army
provided
they
at
once
dispersed
except
ten
persons
six
named
and
four
unnamed
and
were
you
amongst
those
named
lord
abbot
demanded
one
of
the
monks
john
paslew
abbot
of
whalley
it
was
said
headed
the
list
replied
the
other
with
a
bitter
smile
next
came
william
trafford
abbot
of
salley
next
adam
sudbury
abbot
of
jervaux
then
our
leader
robert
aske
then
john
eastgate
monk
of
whalley
how
lord
abbot
exclaimed
the
monk
was
my
name
mentioned
it
was
rejoined
the
abbot
and
that
of
william
haydocke
also
monk
of
whalley
closed
the
list
the
unrelenting
tyrant
muttered
the
other
monk
but
these
terms
could
not
be
accepted
assuredly
not
replied
paslew
they
were
rejected
with
scorn
but
the
negotiations
were
continued
by
sir
ralph
ellerker
and
sir
robert
bowas
who
were
to
claim
on
our
part
a
free
pardon
for
all
the
establishment
of
a
parliament
and
courts
of
justice
at
york
the
restoration
of
the
princess
mary
to
the
succession
the
pope
to
his
jurisdiction
and
our
brethren
to
their
houses
but
such
conditions
will
never
be
granted
with
my
consent
no
armistice
should
have
been
agreed
to
we
are
sure
to
lose
by
the
delay
but
i
was
overruled
by
the
archbishop
of
york
and
the
lord
darcy
their
voices
prevailed
against
the
abbot
of
whalley
or
if
it
please
you
the
earl
of
poverty
it
is
the
assumption
of
that
derisive
title
which
has
drawn
upon
you
the
full
force
of
the
king
resentment
lord
abbot
observed
father
eastgate
it
may
be
replied
the
abbot
i
took
it
in
mockery
of
cromwell
and
the
ecclesiastical
commissioners
and
i
rejoice
that
they
have
felt
the
sting
the
abbot
of
barlings
called
himself
captain
cobbler
because
as
he
affirmed
the
state
wanted
mending
like
old
shoon
and
is
not
my
title
equally
well
chosen
is
not
the
church
smitten
with
poverty
have
not
ten
thousand
of
our
brethren
been
driven
from
their
homes
to
beg
or
to
starve
have
not
the
houseless
poor
whom
we
fed
at
our
gates
and
lodged
within
our
wards
gone
away
hungry
and
without
rest
have
not
the
sick
whom
we
would
have
relieved
died
untended
by
the
i
am
the
head
of
the
poor
in
lancashire
the
redresser
of
their
grievances
and
therefore
i
style
myself
earl
of
poverty
have
i
not
done
well
you
have
lord
abbot
replied
father
eastgate
poverty
will
not
alone
be
the
fate
of
the
church
but
of
the
whole
realm
if
the
rapacious
designs
of
the
monarch
and
his
heretical
counsellors
are
carried
forth
pursued
the
abbot
cromwell
audeley
and
rich
have
wisely
ordained
that
no
infant
shall
be
baptised
without
tribute
to
the
king
that
no
man
who
owns
not
above
twenty
pounds
a
year
shall
consume
wheaten
bread
or
eat
the
flesh
of
fowl
or
swine
without
tribute
and
that
all
ploughed
land
shall
pay
tribute
likewise
thus
the
church
is
to
be
beggared
the
poor
plundered
and
all
men
burthened
to
fatten
the
king
and
fill
his
exchequer
this
must
be
a
jest
observed
father
haydocke
it
is
a
jest
no
man
laughs
at
rejoined
the
abbot
sternly
any
more
than
the
king
counsellors
will
laugh
at
the
earl
of
poverty
whose
title
they
themselves
have
created
but
wherefore
comes
not
the
signal
can
aught
have
gone
wrong
i
will
not
think
it
the
whole
country
from
the
tweed
to
the
humber
and
from
the
lune
to
the
mersey
is
ours
and
if
we
but
hold
together
our
cause
must
prevail
yet
we
have
many
and
powerful
enemies
observed
father
eastgate
and
the
king
it
is
said
hath
sworn
never
to
make
terms
with
us
tidings
were
brought
to
the
abbey
this
morning
that
the
earl
of
derby
is
assembling
forces
at
preston
to
march
upon
us
we
will
give
him
a
warm
reception
if
he
comes
replied
paslew
fiercely
he
will
find
that
our
walls
have
not
been
kernelled
and
embattled
by
licence
of
good
king
edward
the
third
for
nothing
and
that
our
brethren
can
fight
as
well
as
their
predecessors
fought
in
the
time
of
abbot
holden
when
they
took
tithe
by
force
from
sir
christopher
parsons
of
slaydburn
the
abbey
is
strong
and
right
well
defended
and
we
need
not
fear
a
surprise
but
it
grows
dark
fast
and
yet
no
signal
comes
perchance
the
waters
of
the
don
have
again
risen
so
as
to
prevent
the
army
from
fording
the
stream
observed
father
haydocke
or
it
may
be
that
some
disaster
hath
befallen
our
leader
nay
i
will
not
believe
the
latter
said
the
abbot
robert
aske
is
chosen
by
heaven
to
be
our
deliverer
it
has
been
prophesied
that
a
with
one
eye
shall
work
the
redemption
of
the
fallen
faith
and
you
know
that
robert
aske
hath
been
deprived
of
his
left
orb
by
an
arrow
therefore
it
is
observed
father
eastgate
that
the
pilgrims
of
grace
chant
the
following
ditty
shall
come
an
aske
with
one
eye
he
shall
be
chief
of
the
company
chief
of
the
northern
chivalry
what
more
demanded
the
abbot
seeing
that
the
monk
appeared
to
hesitate
nay
i

not
whether
the
rest
of
the
rhymes

remarked

for

silent
and
sullen
enough
yet
when
he
doth
talk
it
is
not

one
of

with

he
consorts
but
in

phrase
and
his

is
as

as
that
of

hark
he
sings
cried
father
haydocke
and
as
he
spoke
a
voice
was
heard
chanting
one
shall

at
a
solemn
feast
half
warrior
half
priest
the
greatest
there
shall
be
the

the
very

cried

the
voice
resumed
he

poor
as

and
earl
of

monk
and
soldier
rich
and

hang
at
his

door
loud
derisive
laughter
followed
the
song
by
our
lady
of
whalley
the
knave
is
mocking
us
cried
the
abbot
send
a
bolt
to
silence
him
cuthbert
the
forester
instantly
bent
his
bow
and
a
quarrel
whistled
off
in
the
direction
of
the
singer
but
whether
his
aim
were
not
truly
taken
or
he
meant
not
to
hit
the
mark
it
is
certain
that
demdike
remained
untouched
the
reputed
wizard
laughed
aloud
took
off
his
felt
cap
in
acknowledgment
and
marched
deliberately
down
the
side
of
the
hill
thou
art
not
wont
to
miss
thy
aim
cuthbert
cried
the
abbot
with
a
look
of
displeasure
take
good
heed
thou
producest
this
scurril
knave
before
me
when
these
troublous
times
are
over
but
what
is
this
he
stops
ha
he
is
practising
his
devilries
on
the
mountain
side
it
would
seem
that
the
abbot
had
good
warrant
for
what
he
said
as
demdike
having
paused
at
a
broad
green
patch
on
the
was
now
busied
in
tracing
a
circle
round
it
with
his
staff
he
then
spoke
aloud
some
words
which
the
superstitious
beholders
construed
into
an
incantation
and
after
tracing
the
circle
once
again
and
casting
some
tufts
of
dry
heather
which
he
plucked
from
an
adjoining
hillock
on
three
particular
spots
he
ran
quickly
downwards
followed
by
his
hound
and
leaping
a
stone
wall
surrounding
a
little
orchard
at
the
foot
of
the
hill
disappeared
from
view
go
and
see
what
he
hath
done
cried
the
abbot
to
the
forester
for
i
like
it
not
ashbead
instantly
obeyed
and
on
reaching
the
green
spot
in
question
shouted
out
that
he
could
discern
nothing
but
presently
added
as
he
moved
about
that
the
turf
heaved
like
a
beneath
his
feet
and
he
thought
to
use
his
own
phraseology
would
brast
the
abbot
then
commanded
him
to
go
down
to
the
orchard
below
and
if
he
could
find
demdike
to
bring
him
to
him
instantly
the
forester
did
as
he
was
bidden
ran
down
the
hill
and
leaping
the
orchard
wall
as
the
other
had
done
was
lost
to
sight
ere
long
it
became
quite
dark
and
as
ashbead
did
not
reappear
the
abbot
gave
vent
to
his
impatience
and
uneasiness
and
was
proposing
to
send
one
of
the
herdsmen
in
search
of
him
when
his
attention
was
suddenly
diverted
by
a
loud
shout
from
one
of
the
sentinels
and
a
fire
was
seen
on
a
distant
hill
on
the
right
the
signal
the
signal
cried
paslew
joyfully
kindle
a
torch
quick
quick
and
as
he
spoke
he
seized
a
brand
and
plunged
it
into
the
peat
fire
while
his
example
was
followed
by
the
two
monks
it
is
the
beacon
on
blackstone
edge
cried
the
abbot
and
look
a
second
blazes
over
the
grange
of
cliviger
another
on
ightenhill
another
on
boulsworth
hill
and
the
last
on
the
neighbouring
heights
of
padiham
our
own
comes
next
may
it
light
the
enemies
of
our
holy
church
to
perdition
with
this
he
applied
the
burning
brand
to
the
combustible
matter
of
the
beacon
the
monks
did
the
same
and
in
an
instant
a
tall
pointed
flame
rose
up
from
a
thick
cloud
of
smoke
ere
another
minute
had
elapsed
similar
fires
shot
up
to
the
right
and
the
left
on
the
high
lands
of
trawden
forest
on
the
jagged
points
of
foulridge
on
the
summit
of
cowling
hill
and
so
on
to
skipton
other
fires
again
blazed
on
the
towers
of
clithero
on
longridge
and
ribchester
on
the
woody
eminences
of
bowland
on
wolf
crag
and
on
fell
and
scar
all
the
way
to
lancaster
it
seemed
the
work
of
enchantment
so
suddenly
and
so
strangely
did
the
fires
shoot
forth
as
the
beacon
flame
increased
it
lighted
up
the
whole
of
the
extensive
on
the
summit
of
pendle
hill
and
a
long
lurid
streak
fell
on
the
darkling
near
which
the
wizard
had
stood
but
when
it
attained
its
utmost
height
it
revealed
the
depths
of
the
forest
below
and
a
red
reflection
here
and
there
marked
the
course
of
pendle
water
the
excitement
of
the
abbot
and
his
companions
momently
increased
and
the
sentinels
shouted
as
each
new
beacon
was
lighted
at
last
almost
every
hill
had
its
and
so
extraordinary
was
the
spectacle
that
it
seemed
as
if
weird
beings
were
abroad
and
holding
their
revels
on
the
heights
then
it
was
that
the
abbot
mounting
his
steed
called
out
to
the
monks
holy
fathers
you
will
follow
to
the
abbey
as
you
may
i
shall
ride
fleetly
on
and
despatch
two
hundred
archers
to
huddersfield
and
wakefield
the
abbots
of
salley
and
jervaux
with
the
prior
of
burlington
will
be
with
me
at
midnight
and
at
daybreak
we
shall
march
our
forces
to
join
the
main
army
heaven
be
with
you
stay
cried
a
harsh
imperious
voice
stay
and
to
his
surprise
the
abbot
beheld
nicholas
demdike
standing
before
him
the
aspect
of
the
wizard
was
dark
and
forbidding
and
seen
by
the
beacon
light
his
savage
features
blazing
eyes
tall
gaunt
frame
and
fantastic
garb
made
him
look
like
something
unearthly
flinging
his
staff
over
his
shoulder
he
slowly
approached
with
his
black
hound
following
close
by
at
his
heels
i
have
a
caution
to
give
you
lord
abbot
he
said
hear
me
speak
before
you
set
out
for
the
abbey
or
ill
will
befall
you
ill
befall
me
if
i
listen
to
thee
thou
wicked
churl
cried
the
abbot
what
hast
thou
done
with
cuthbert
ashbead
i
have
seen
nothing
of
him
since
he
sent
a
bolt
after
me
at
your
bidding
lord
abbot
replied
demdike
beware
lest
any
harm
come
to
him
or
thou
wilt
rue
it
cried
paslew
but
i
have
no
time
to
waste
on
thee
farewell
fathers
high
mass
will
be
said
in
the
convent
church
before
we
set
out
on
the
expedition
morning
you
will
both
attend
it
you
will
never
set
out
upon
the
expedition
lord
abbot
cried
demdike
planting
his
staff
so
suddenly
into
the
ground
before
the
horse
head
that
the
animal
reared
and
nearly
threw
his
rider
how
now
fellow
what
mean
you
cried
the
abbot
furiously
to
warn
you
replied
demdike
stand
aside
cried
the
abbot
spurring
his
steed
or
i
will
trample
you
beneath
my
horse
feet
i
might
let
you
ride
to
your
own
doom
rejoined
demdike
with
a
scornful
laugh
as
he
seized
the
abbot
bridle
but
you
shall
hear
me
i
tell
you
you
will
never
go
forth
on
this
expedition
i
tell
you
that
ere
whalley
abbey
will
have
passed
for
ever
from
your
possession
and
that
if
you
go
thither
again
your
life
will
be
forfeited
now
will
you
listen
to
me
i
am
wrong
in
doing
so
cried
the
abbot
who
could
not
however
repress
some
feelings
of
misgiving
at
this
alarming
address
speak
what
would
you
say
come
out
of
earshot
of
the
others
and
i
will
tell
you
replied
demdike
and
he
led
the
abbot
horse
to
some
distance
further
on
the
hill
your
cause
will
fail
lord
abbot
he
then
said
nay
it
is
lost
already
lost
cried
the
abbot
out
of
all
patience
lost
look
around
twenty
fires
are
in
sight
ay
thirty
and
every
fire
thou
seest
will
summon
a
hundred
men
at
the
least
to
arms
before
an
hour
five
hundred
men
will
be
gathered
before
the
gates
of
whalley
abbey
true
replied
demdike
but
they
will
not
own
the
earl
of
poverty
for
their
leader
what
leader
will
they
own
then
demanded
the
abbot
scornfully
the
earl
of
derby
replied
demdike
he
is
on
his
way
thither
with
lord
mounteagle
from
preston
ha
exclaimed
paslew
let
me
go
meet
them
then
but
thou
triflest
with
me
fellow
thou
canst
know
nothing
of
this
whence
thou
thine
information
heed
it
not
replied
the
other
thou
wilt
find
it
correct
i
tell
thee
proud
abbot
that
this
grand
scheme
of
thine
and
of
thy
fellows
for
the
restitution
of
the
catholic
church
has
failed
utterly
failed
i
tell
thee
thou
liest
false
knave
cried
the
abbot
striking
him
on
the
hand
with
his
scourge
quit
thy
hold
and
let
me
go
not
till
i
have
done
replied
demdike
maintaining
his
grasp
well
hast
thou
styled
thyself
earl
of
poverty
for
thou
art
poor
and
miserable
enough
abbot
of
whalley
thou
art
no
longer
thy
possessions
will
be
taken
from
thee
and
if
thou
returnest
thy
life
also
will
be
taken
if
thou
fleest
a
price
will
be
set
upon
thy
head
i
alone
can
save
thee
and
i
will
do
so
on
one
condition
condition
make
conditions
with
thee
of
satan
cried
the
abbot
gnashing
his
teeth
i
reproach
myself
that
i
have
listened
to
thee
so
long
stand
aside
or
i
will
strike
thee
dead
you
are
wholly
in
my
power
cried
demdike
with
a
disdainful
laugh
and
as
he
spoke
he
pressed
the
large
sharp
bit
against
the
charger
mouth
and
backed
him
quickly
to
the
very
edge
of
the
hill
the
sides
of
which
here
sloped
precipitously
down
the
abbot
would
have
uttered
a
cry
but
surprise
and
terror
kept
him
silent
were
it
my
desire
to
injure
you
i
could
cast
you
down
the
to
certain
death
pursued
demdike
but
i
have
no
such
wish
on
the
contrary
i
will
serve
you
as
i
have
said
on
one
condition
thy
condition
would
imperil
my
soul
said
the
abbot
full
of
wrath
and
alarm
thou
seekest
in
vain
to
terrify
me
into
compliance
retro
i
defy
thee
and
all
thy
works
demdike
laughed
scornfully
the
thunders
of
the
church
do
not
frighten
me
he
cried
but
look
he
added
you
doubted
my
word
when
i
told
you
the
rising
was
at
an
end
the
beacon
fires
on
boulsworth
hill
and
on
the
grange
of
cliviger
are
extinguished
that
on
padiham
heights
is
expiring
nay
it
is
out
and
ere
many
minutes
all
these
mountain
will
have
disappeared
like
lamps
at
the
close
of
a
feast
by
our
lady
it
is
so
cried
the
abbot
in
increasing
terror
what
new
jugglery
is
this
it
is
no
jugglery
i
tell
you
replied
the
other
the
waters
of
the
don
have
again
arisen
the
insurgents
have
accepted
the
king
pardon
have
deserted
their
leaders
and
dispersed
there
will
be
no
rising
or
on
the
morrow
the
abbots
of
jervaux
and
salley
will
strive
to
capitulate
but
in
vain
the
pilgrimage
of
grace
is
ended
the
stake
for
which
thou
playedst
is
lost
thirty
years
hast
thou
governed
here
but
thy
rule
is
over
seventeen
abbots
have
there
been
of
whalley
the
last
thou
but
there
shall
be
none
more
it
must
be
the
demon
in
person
that
speaks
thus
to
me
cried
the
abbot
his
hair
bristling
on
his
head
and
a
cold
perspiration
bursting
from
his
pores
no
matter
who
i
am
replied
the
other
i
have
said
i
will
aid
thee
on
one
condition
it
is
not
much
remove
thy
ban
from
my
wife
and
baptise
her
infant
daughter
and
i
am
content
i
would
not
ask
thee
for
this
service
slight
though
it
be
but
the
poor
soul
hath
set
her
mind
upon
it
wilt
thou
do
it
no
replied
the
abbot
shuddering
i
will
not
baptise
a
daughter
of
satan
i
will
not
sell
my
soul
to
the
powers
of
darkness
i
adjure
thee
to
depart
from
me
and
tempt
me
no
longer
vainly
thou
seekest
to
cast
me
off
rejoined
demdike
what
if
i
deliver
thine
adversaries
into
thine
hands
and
revenge
thee
upon
them
even
now
there
are
a
party
of
armed
men
waiting
at
the
foot
of
the
hill
to
seize
thee
and
thy
brethren
shall
i
show
thee
how
to
destroy
them
who
are
they
demanded
the
abbot
surprised
their
leaders
are
john
braddyll
and
richard
assheton
who
shall
divide
whalley
abbey
between
them
if
thou
stayest
them
not
replied
demdike
hell
consume
them
cried
the
abbot
thy
speech
shows
consent
rejoined
demdike
come
this
way
and
without
awaiting
the
abbot
reply
he
dragged
his
horse
towards
the
of
the
mountain
as
they
went
on
the
two
monks
who
had
been
filled
with
surprise
at
the
interview
though
they
did
not
dare
to
interrupt
it
advanced
towards
their
superior
and
looked
earnestly
and
inquiringly
at
him
but
he
remained
silent
while
to
the
and
the
herdsmen
who
demanded
whether
their
own
should
be
extinguished
as
the
others
had
been
he
answered
moodily
in
the
negative
where
are
the
foes
you
spoke
of
he
asked
with
some
uneasiness
as
demdike
led
his
horse
slowly
and
carefully
down
the
you
shall
see
anon
replied
the
other
you
are
taking
me
to
the
spot
where
you
traced
the
magic
circle
cried
paslew
in
alarm
i
know
it
from
its
unnaturally
green
hue
i
will
not
go
thither
i
do
not
mean
you
should
lord
abbot
replied
demdike
halting
remain
on
this
firm
ground
nay
be
not
alarmed
you
are
in
no
danger
now
bid
your
men
advance
and
prepare
their
weapons
the
abbot
would
have
demanded
wherefore
but
at
a
glance
from
demdike
he
complied
and
the
two
and
the
herdsmen
arranged
themselves
beside
him
while
fathers
eastgate
and
haydocke
who
had
gotten
upon
their
mules
took
up
a
position
behind
scarcely
were
they
thus
placed
when
a
loud
shout
was
raised
below
and
a
band
of
armed
men
to
the
number
of
thirty
or
forty
leapt
the
stone
wall
and
began
to
scale
the
hill
with
great
rapidity
they
came
up
a
deep
dry
channel
apparently
worn
in
the
by
some
former
torrent
and
which
led
directly
to
the
spot
where
demdike
and
the
abbot
stood
the
still
blazed
brightly
and
illuminated
the
whole
proceeding
showing
that
these
men
from
their
accoutrements
were
royalist
soldiers
stir
not
as
you
value
your
life
said
the
wizard
to
paslew
but
observe
what
shall
follow
chapter
the
eruption
demdike
went
a
little
further
down
the
hill
stopping
when
he
came
to
the
green
patch
he
then
plunged
his
staff
into
the
sod
at
the
first
point
where
he
had
cast
a
tuft
of
heather
and
with
such
force
that
it
sank
more
than
three
feet
the
next
moment
he
plucked
it
forth
as
if
with
a
great
effort
and
a
jet
of
black
water
spouted
into
the
air
but
heedless
of
this
he
went
to
the
next
marked
spot
and
again
plunged
the
sharp
point
of
the
implement
into
the
ground
again
it
sank
to
the
same
depth
and
on
being
drawn
out
a
second
black
jet
sprung
forth
meanwhile
the
hostile
party
continued
to
advance
up
the
dry
channel
before
mentioned
and
shouted
on
beholding
these
strange
preparations
but
they
did
not
relax
their
speed
once
more
the
staff
sank
into
the
ground
and
a
third
black
fountain
followed
its
extraction
by
this
time
the
royalist
soldiers
were
close
at
hand
and
the
features
of
their
two
leaders
john
braddyll
and
richard
assheton
could
be
plainly
distinguished
and
their
voices
heard
is
he
is
the
rebel
abbot
vociferated
braddyll
pressing
forward
we
were
not
misinformed
he
has
been
watching
by
the
beacon
the
devil
has
delivered
him
into
our
hands
ho
ho
laughed
demdike
abbot
no
longer
is
the
earl
of
poverty
you
mean
responded
assheton
the
villain
shall
be
gibbeted
on
the
spot
where
he
has
fired
the
beacon
as
a
warning
to
all
traitors
ha
heretics
ha
blasphemers
i
can
at
least
avenge
myself
upon
you
cried
paslew
striking
spurs
into
his
charger
but
ere
he
could
execute
his
purpose
demdike
had
sprung
backward
and
catching
the
bridle
restrained
the
animal
by
a
powerful
effort
hold
he
cried
in
a
voice
of
thunder
or
you
will
share
their
fate
as
the
words
were
uttered
a
dull
booming
subterranean
sound
was
heard
and
instantly
afterwards
with
a
crash
like
thunder
the
whole
of
the
green
circle
beneath
slipped
off
and
from
a
yawning
rent
under
it
burst
forth
with
irresistible
fury
a
thick
torrent
which
rising
almost
breast
high
fell
upon
the
devoted
royalist
soldiers
who
were
advancing
right
in
its
course
unable
to
avoid
the
watery
eruption
or
to
resist
its
fury
when
it
came
upon
them
they
were
instantly
swept
from
their
feet
and
carried
down
the
channel
a
sight
of
horror
was
it
to
behold
the
sudden
rise
of
that
swarthy
stream
whose
waters
tinged
by
the
ruddy
glare
of
the
looked
like
waves
of
blood
nor
less
fearful
was
it
to
hear
the
first
wild
despairing
cry
raised
by
the
victims
or
the
quickly
stifled
shrieks
and
groans
that
followed
mixed
with
the
deafening
roar
of
the
stream
and
the
crashing
fall
of
the
stones
which
accompanied
its
course
down
down
went
the
poor
wretches
now
utterly
overwhelmed
by
the
torrent
now
regaining
their
feet
only
to
utter
a
scream
and
then
be
swept
off
here
a
miserable
struggler
whirled
onward
would
clutch
at
the
banks
and
try
to
scramble
forth
but
the
soft
turf
giving
way
beneath
him
he
was
hurried
off
to
eternity
at
another
point
where
the
stream
encountered
some
trifling
opposition
some
two
or
three
managed
to
gain
a
footing
but
they
were
unable
to
extricate
themselves
the
vast
quantity
of
boggy
soil
brought
down
by
the
current
and
which
rapidly
collected
here
embedded
them
and
held
them
fast
so
that
the
momently
deepening
water
already
up
to
their
chins
threatened
speedy
immersion
others
were
stricken
down
by
great
masses
of
turf
or
huge
rocky
fragments
which
bounding
from
point
to
point
with
the
torrent
bruised
or
crushed
all
they
encountered
or
lodging
in
some
difficult
place
slightly
diverted
the
course
of
the
torrent
and
rendered
it
yet
more
dangerous
on
one
of
these
stones
larger
than
the
rest
which
had
been
stopped
in
its
course
a
man
contrived
to
creep
and
with
difficulty
kept
his
post
amid
the
raging
flood
vainly
did
he
extend
his
hand
to
such
of
his
fellows
as
were
swept
shrieking
past
him
he
could
not
lend
them
aid
while
his
own
position
was
so
desperately
hazardous
that
he
did
not
dare
to
quit
it
to
leap
on
either
bank
was
impossible
and
to
breast
the
headlong
stream
certain
death
on
goes
the
current
madly
furiously
as
if
rejoicing
in
the
work
of
destruction
while
the
white
foam
of
its
eddies
presents
a
fearful
contrast
to
the
prevailing
blackness
of
the
surface
over
the
last
declivity
it
leaps
hissing
foaming
crashing
like
an
avalanche
the
stone
wall
for
a
moment
opposes
its
force
but
falls
the
next
with
a
mighty
splash
carrying
the
spray
far
and
wide
while
its
own
fragments
roll
onwards
with
the
stream
the
trees
of
the
orchard
are
uprooted
in
an
instant
and
an
old
elm
falls
prostrate
the
outbuildings
of
a
cottage
are
invaded
and
the
porkers
and
cattle
divining
their
danger
squeal
and
bellow
in
affright
but
they
are
quickly
silenced
the
resistless
foe
has
broken
down
wall
and
door
and
buried
the
poor
creatures
in
mud
and
rubbish
the
stream
next
invades
the
cottage
breaks
in
through
door
and
window
and
filling
all
the
lower
part
of
the
tenement
in
a
few
minutes
converts
it
into
a
heap
of
ruin
on
goes
the
destroyer
tearing
up
more
trees
levelling
more
houses
and
filling
up
a
small
pool
till
the
latter
bursts
its
banks
and
with
an
accession
to
its
force
pours
itself
into
a
here
its
waters
are
stayed
until
they
find
a
vent
underneath
and
the
action
of
the
stream
as
it
rushes
downwards
through
this
exit
forms
a
great
eddy
above
in
which
swim
some
living
things
cattle
and
sheep
from
the
fold
not
yet
drowned
mixed
with
furniture
from
the
cottages
and
amidst
them
the
bodies
of
some
of
the
unfortunate
which
have
been
washed
hither
but
ha
another
thundering
crash
the
dam
has
burst
the
torrent
roars
and
rushes
on
furiously
as
before
joins
its
forces
with
pendle
water
swells
up
the
river
and
devastates
the
country
far
and
wide
the
abbot
and
his
companions
beheld
this
work
of
destruction
with
amazement
and
dread
blanched
terror
sat
in
their
cheeks
and
the
blood
was
frozen
in
paslew
veins
for
he
thought
it
the
work
of
the
powers
of
darkness
and
that
he
was
leagued
with
them
he
tried
to
mutter
a
prayer
but
his
lips
refused
their
office
he
would
have
moved
but
his
limbs
were
stiffened
and
paralysed
and
he
could
only
gaze
aghast
at
the
terrible
spectacle
amidst
it
all
he
heard
a
wild
burst
of
unearthly
laughter
proceeding
he
thought
from
demdike
and
it
filled
him
with
new
dread
but
he
could
not
check
the
sound
neither
could
he
stop
his
ears
though
he
would
fain
have
done
so
like
him
his
companions
were
petrified
and
speechless
with
fear
after
this
had
endured
for
some
time
though
still
the
black
torrent
rushed
on
impetuously
as
ever
demdike
turned
to
the
abbot
and
said
your
vengeance
has
been
fully
gratified
you
will
now
baptise
my
child
never
never
accursed
being
shrieked
the
abbot
thou
mayst
sacrifice
her
at
thine
own
impious
rites
but
see
there
is
one
poor
wretch
yet
struggling
with
the
foaming
torrent
i
may
save
him
that
is
john
braddyll
thy
worst
enemy
replied
demdike
if
he
lives
he
shall
possess
half
whalley
abbey
thou
hadst
best
also
save
richard
assheton
who
yet
clings
to
the
great
stone
below
as
if
he
escapes
he
shall
have
the
other
half
mark
him
and
make
haste
for
in
five
minutes
both
shall
be
gone
i
will
save
them
if
i
can
be
the
consequence
to
myself
what
it
may
replied
the
abbot
and
regardless
of
the
derisive
laughter
of
the
other
who
yelled
in
his
ears
as
he
went
bess
shall
see
thee
hanged
at
thy
own
door
he
dashed
down
the
hill
to
the
spot
where
a
small
object
distinguishable
above
the
stream
showed
that
some
one
still
kept
his
head
above
water
his
tall
stature
having
preserved
him
is
it
you
john
braddyll
cried
the
abbot
as
he
rode
up
ay
replied
the
head
forgive
me
for
the
wrong
i
intended
you
and
deliver
me
from
this
great
peril
i
am
come
for
that
purpose
replied
the
abbot
dismounting
and
disencumbering
himself
of
his
heavy
cloak
by
this
time
the
two
herdsmen
had
come
up
and
the
abbot
taking
a
crook
from
one
of
them
clutched
hold
of
the
fellow
and
plunging
fearlessly
into
the
stream
extended
it
towards
the
drowning
man
who
instantly
lifted
up
his
hand
to
grasp
it
in
doing
so
braddyll
lost
his
balance
but
as
he
did
not
quit
his
hold
he
was
plucked
forth
from
the
tenacious
mud
by
the
combined
efforts
of
the
abbot
and
his
assistant
and
with
some
difficulty
dragged
ashore
now
for
the
other
cried
paslew
as
he
placed
braddyll
in
safety
the
abbey
is
gone
from
thee
shouted
a
voice
in
his
ears
as
he
rushed
on
presently
he
reached
the
rocky
fragment
on
which
ralph
assheton
rested
the
latter
was
in
great
danger
from
the
surging
torrent
and
the
stone
on
which
he
had
taken
refuge
tottered
at
its
base
and
threatened
to
roll
over
in
heaven
name
help
me
lord
abbot
as
thou
thyself
shall
be
holpen
at
thy
need
shrieked
assheton
be
not
afraid
richard
assheton
replied
paslew
i
will
deliver
thee
as
i
have
delivered
john
braddyll
but
the
task
was
not
of
easy
accomplishment
the
abbot
made
his
preparations
as
before
grasped
the
hand
of
the
herdsman
and
held
out
the
crook
to
assheton
but
when
the
latter
caught
it
the
stream
swung
him
round
with
such
force
that
the
abbot
must
either
abandon
him
or
advance
further
into
the
water
bent
on
assheton
preservation
he
adopted
the
latter
expedient
and
instantly
lost
his
feet
while
the
herdsman
unable
longer
to
hold
him
let
go
the
crook
and
the
abbot
and
assheton
were
swept
down
the
stream
together
down
down
they
went
destruction
apparently
awaiting
them
but
the
abbot
though
sometimes
quite
under
the
water
and
bruised
by
the
rough
stones
and
gravel
with
which
he
came
in
contact
still
retained
his
and
encouraged
his
companion
to
hope
for
succour
in
this
way
they
were
borne
down
to
the
foot
of
the
hill
the
monks
the
herdsmen
and
the
having
given
them
up
as
lost
but
they
yet
lived
yet
floated
though
greatly
injured
and
almost
senseless
when
they
were
cast
into
a
pool
formed
by
the
eddying
waters
at
the
foot
of
the
hill
here
wholly
unable
to
assist
himself
assheton
was
seized
by
a
black
hound
belonging
to
a
tall
man
who
stood
on
the
bank
and
who
shouted
to
paslew
as
he
helped
the
animal
to
bring
the
drowning
man
ashore
the
other
half
of
the
abbey
is
gone
from
thee
wilt
thou
baptise
my
child
if
i
send
my
dog
to
save
thee
never
replied
the
other
sinking
as
he
spoke
flashes
of
fire
glanced
in
the
abbot
eyes
and
stunning
sounds
seemed
to
burst
his
ears
a
few
more
struggles
and
he
became
senseless
but
he
was
not
destined
to
die
thus
what
happened
afterwards
he
knew
not
but
when
he
recovered
full
consciousness
he
found
himself
stretched
with
aching
limbs
and
throbbing
head
upon
a
couch
in
a
monastic
room
with
a
and
gilded
ceiling
with
shields
at
the
corners
emblazoned
with
the
three
luces
of
whalley
and
with
panels
hung
with
tapestry
from
the
looms
of
flanders
representing
divers
scriptural
subjects
have
i
been
dreaming
he
murmured
no
replied
a
tall
man
standing
by
his
bedside
thou
hast
been
saved
from
one
death
to
suffer
another
more
ignominious
ha
cried
the
abbot
starting
up
and
pressing
his
hand
to
his
temples
thou
here
ay
i
am
appointed
to
watch
thee
replied
demdike
thou
art
a
prisoner
in
thine
own
chamber
at
whalley
all
has
befallen
as
i
told
thee
the
earl
of
derby
is
master
of
the
abbey
thy
adherents
are
dispersed
and
thy
brethren
are
driven
forth
thy
two
partners
in
rebellion
the
abbots
of
jervaux
and
salley
have
been
conveyed
to
lancaster
castle
whither
thou
wilt
go
as
soon
as
thou
canst
be
moved
i
will
surrender
all
silver
and
gold
land
and
possessions
to
the
king
if
i
may
die
in
peace
groaned
the
abbot
it
is
not
needed
rejoined
the
other
attainted
of
felony
thy
lands
and
abbey
will
be
forfeited
to
the
crown
and
they
shall
be
sold
as
i
have
told
thee
to
john
braddyll
and
richard
assheton
who
will
be
rulers
here
in
thy
stead
would
i
had
perished
in
the
flood
groaned
the
abbot
well
mayst
thou
wish
so
returned
his
tormentor
but
thou
wert
not
destined
to
die
by
water
as
i
have
said
thou
shalt
be
hanged
at
thy
own
door
and
my
wife
shall
witness
thy
end
who
art
thou
i
have
heard
thy
voice
before
cried
the
abbot
it
is
like
the
voice
of
one
whom
i
knew
years
ago
and
thy
features
are
like
his
though
changed
greatly
changed
who
art
thou
thou
shalt
know
before
thou
diest
replied
the
other
with
a
look
of
gratified
vengeance
farewell
and
reflect
upon
thy
fate
so
saying
he
strode
towards
the
door
while
the
miserable
abbot
arose
and
marching
with
uncertain
steps
to
a
little
oratory
adjoining
which
he
himself
had
built
knelt
down
before
the
altar
and
strove
to
pray
chapter
whalley
abbey
a
sad
sad
change
hath
come
over
the
fair
abbey
of
whalley
it
knoweth
its
old
masters
no
longer
for
upwards
of
two
centuries
and
a
half
hath
the
blessed
place
grown
in
beauty
and
riches
seventeen
abbots
have
exercised
unbounded
hospitality
within
it
but
now
they
are
all
gone
save
one
and
he
is
attainted
of
felony
and
treason
the
grave
monk
walketh
no
more
in
the
cloisters
nor
seeketh
his
pallet
in
the
dormitory
vesper
or
resound
not
as
of
old
within
the
fine
conventual
church
stripped
are
the
altars
of
their
silver
crosses
and
the
shrines
of
their
votive
offerings
and
saintly
relics
pyx
and
chalice
thuribule
and
vial
pastoral
staff
and
mitre
embossed
with
pearls
candlestick
and
christmas
ship
of
silver
salver
basin
and
ewer
all
are
gone
the
splendid
sacristy
hath
been
despoiled
a
sad
sad
change
hath
come
over
whalley
abbey
the
libraries
well
stored
with
reverend
tomes
have
been
pillaged
and
their
contents
cast
to
the
flames
and
thus
long
laboured
manuscript
the
fruit
of
years
of
patient
industry
with
gloriously
illuminated
missal
are
irrecoverably
lost
the
large
infirmary
no
longer
receiveth
the
sick
in
the
locutory
sitteth
no
more
the
guest
no
longer
in
the
mighty
kitchens
are
prepared
the
prodigious
supply
of
meats
destined
for
the
support
of
the
poor
or
the
entertainment
of
the
traveller
no
kindly
porter
stands
at
the
gate
to
bid
the
stranger
enter
and
partake
of
the
munificent
hospitality
but
a
churlish
guard
bids
him
hie
away
and
menaces
him
if
he
tarries
with
his
halbert
closed
are
the
and
the
pantries
and
the
daily
dole
of
bread
hath
ceased
closed
also
to
the
brethren
is
the
refectory
the
cellarer
office
is
ended
the
strong
ale
which
he
brewed
in
october
is
tapped
in
march
by
roystering
troopers
the
rich
muscadel
and
malmsey
and
the
wines
of
gascoigne
and
the
rhine
are
no
longer
quaffed
by
the
abbot
and
his
more
honoured
guests
but
drunk
to
his
destruction
by
his
foes
the
great
gallery
a
hundred
and
fifty
feet
in
length
the
pride
of
the
abbot
lodging
and
a
model
of
architecture
is
filled
not
with
ecclesiastics
but
with
an
armed
earl
and
his
retainers
neglected
is
the
little
oratory
dedicated
to
our
lady
of
whalley
where
night
and
morn
the
abbot
used
to
pray
all
the
old
religious
and
hospitable
uses
of
the
abbey
are
foregone
the
reverend
stillness
of
the
cloisters
scarce
broken
by
the
quiet
tread
of
the
monks
is
now
disturbed
by
armed
heel
and
clank
of
sword
while
in
its
saintly
courts
are
heard
the
ribald
song
the
profane
jest
and
the
angry
brawl
of
the
brethren
only
those
tenanting
the
cemetery
are
left
all
else
are
gone
driven
forth
as
vagabonds
with
stripes
and
curses
to
seek
refuge
where
they
may
a
sad
sad
change
has
come
over
whalley
abbey
in
the
plenitude
of
its
pride
and
power
has
it
been
cast
down
desecrated
despoiled
its
treasures
are
carried
off
its
ornaments
sold
its
granaries
emptied
its
possessions
wasted
its
storehouses
sacked
its
cattle
slaughtered
and
sold
but
though
stripped
of
its
wealth
and
splendour
though
deprived
of
all
the
religious
graces
that
like
rich
incense
lent
an
odour
to
the
fane
its
external
beauty
is
yet
unimpaired
and
its
vast
proportions
undiminished
a
stately
pile
was
whalley
one
of
the
loveliest
as
well
as
the
largest
in
the
realm
carefully
had
it
been
preserved
by
its
reverend
rulers
and
where
reparations
or
additions
were
needed
they
were
judiciously
made
thus
age
had
lent
it
beauty
by
mellowing
its
freshness
and
toning
its
hues
while
no
decay
was
perceptible
without
a
struggle
had
it
yielded
to
the
captor
so
that
no
part
of
its
wide
belt
of
walls
or
towers
though
so
strongly
constructed
as
to
have
offered
effectual
resistance
were
injured
never
had
whalley
abbey
looked
more
beautiful
than
on
a
bright
clear
morning
in
march
when
this
sad
change
had
been
wrought
and
when
from
a
peaceful
monastic
establishment
it
had
been
converted
into
a
menacing
fortress
the
sunlight
sparkled
upon
its
grey
walls
and
filled
its
three
great
quadrangular
courts
with
light
and
life
piercing
the
exquisite
carving
of
its
cloisters
and
revealing
all
the
intricate
beauty
and
combinations
of
the
arches
stains
of
painted
glass
fell
upon
the
floor
of
the
magnificent
conventual
church
and
dyed
with
rainbow
hues
the
marble
tombs
of
the
lacies
the
founders
of
the
establishment
brought
thither
when
the
monastery
was
removed
from
stanlaw
in
cheshire
and
upon
the
gravestones
of
the
abbots
in
the
presbytery
there
lay
gregory
de
northbury
eighth
abbot
of
stanlaw
and
first
of
whalley
and
william
rede
the
last
abbot
but
there
was
never
to
lie
john
paslew
the
slumber
of
the
ancient
prelates
was
soon
to
be
disturbed
and
the
sacred
structure
within
which
they
had
so
often
worshipped
by
sacrilegious
hands
but
all
was
bright
and
beauteous
now
and
if
no
solemn
strains
were
heard
in
the
holy
pile
its
stillness
was
scarcely
less
reverential
and
the
old
abbey
wreathed
itself
in
all
its
attractions
as
if
to
welcome
back
its
former
ruler
whereas
it
was
only
to
receive
him
as
a
captive
doomed
to
a
felon
death
but
this
was
outward
show
within
all
was
terrible
preparation
such
was
the
discontented
state
of
the
country
that
fearing
some
new
revolt
the
earl
of
derby
had
taken
measures
for
the
defence
of
the
abbey
and
along
the
walls
of
the
close
were
placed
ordnance
and
men
and
within
the
grange
stores
of
ammunition
a
strong
guard
was
set
at
each
of
the
gates
and
the
courts
were
filled
with
troops
the
bray
of
the
trumpet
echoed
within
the
close
where
rounds
were
set
for
the
archers
and
martial
music
resounded
within
the
area
of
the
cloisters
over
the
great
gateway
which
formed
the
chief
entrance
to
the
abbot
lodging
floated
the
royal
banner
despite
these
warlike
proceedings
the
fair
abbey
smiled
beneath
the
sun
in
all
or
more
than
all
its
pristine
beauty
its
green
hills
sloping
gently
down
towards
it
and
the
clear
and
sparkling
calder
dashing
merrily
over
the
stones
at
its
base
but
upon
the
bridge
and
by
the
river
side
and
within
the
little
village
many
persons
were
assembled
conversing
gravely
and
anxiously
together
and
looking
out
towards
the
hills
where
other
groups
were
gathered
as
if
in
expectation
of
some
afflicting
event
most
of
these
were
herdsmen
and
farming
men
but
some
among
them
were
poor
monks
in
the
white
habits
of
the
cistertian
brotherhood
but
which
were
now
stained
and
threadbare
while
their
countenances
bore
traces
of
severest
privation
and
suffering
all
the
herdsmen
and
farmers
had
been
retainers
of
the
abbot
the
poor
monks
looked
wistfully
at
their
former
habitation
but
replied
not
except
by
a
gentle
bowing
of
the
head
to
the
cruel
scoffs
and
taunts
with
which
they
were
greeted
by
the
passing
soldiers
but
the
sturdy
rustics
did
not
bear
these
outrages
so
tamely
and
more
than
one
brawl
ensued
in
which
blood
flowed
while
a
ruffianly
arquebussier
would
have
been
drowned
in
the
calder
but
for
the
exertions
to
save
him
of
a
monk
whom
he
had
attacked
this
took
place
on
the
eleventh
of
march
more
than
three
months
after
the
date
of
the
watching
by
the
beacon
before
recorded
and
the
event
anticipated
by
the
concourse
without
the
abbey
as
well
as
by
those
within
its
walls
was
the
arrival
of
abbot
paslew
and
fathers
eastgate
and
haydocke
who
were
to
be
brought
on
that
day
from
lancaster
and
executed
on
the
following
morning
before
the
abbey
according
to
sentence
passed
upon
them
the
gloomiest
object
in
the
picture
remains
to
be
described
but
yet
it
is
necessary
to
its
completion
this
was
a
gallows
of
unusual
form
and
height
erected
on
the
summit
of
a
gentle
hill
rising
immediately
in
front
of
the
abbot
lodgings
called
the
holehouses
whose
rounded
bosomy
beauty
it
completely
destroyed
this
terrible
apparatus
of
condign
punishment
was
regarded
with
abhorrence
by
the
rustics
and
it
required
a
strong
guard
to
be
kept
constantly
round
it
to
preserve
it
from
demolition
amongst
a
group
of
rustics
collected
on
the
road
leading
to
the
gateway
was
cuthbert
ashbead
who
having
been
deprived
of
his

office
was

checked
by

of
a
monk
who
joining
the
assemblage
called
their
attention
to
a

and
as
the
priestly
train
slowly
approached
with
heads
bowed
down
and
looks
fixed
sadly
upon
the
ground
the
rustic
assemblage
fell
upon
their
knees
and
implored
their
benediction
the
foremost
in
the
procession
passed
on
in
silence
but
the
prior
stopped
and
extending
his
hands
over
the
kneeling
group
cried
in
a
solemn
voice
heaven
bless
ye
my
children
ye
are
about
to
witness
a
sad
spectacle
you
will
see
him
who

rejoined
the
prior
it
will
avail
nothing
and
you
will
only
sacrifice
your
own
lives
our
enemies
are
too
strong
the
abbot
himself
would
give
you
like
counsel
scarcely
were
the
words
uttered
than
from
the
great
gate
of
the
abbey
there
issued
a
dozen
arquebussiers
with
an
officer
at
their
head
who
marched
directly
towards
the
kneeling
hinds
evidently
with
the
intention
of
dispersing
them
behind
them
strode
nicholas
demdike
in
an
instant
the
alarmed
rustics
were
on
their
feet
and
ruchot
o
roaph
and
some
few
among
them
took
to
their
heels
but
ashbead
hal
o
nabs
with
half
a
dozen
others
stood
their
ground
manfully
the
monks
remained
in
the
hope
of
preventing
any
violence
presently
the
halberdiers
came
up
that

ringleader
cried
the
officer

and
as
the

pushed
past
the
monks
to
execute
their

order
he
sprang
forward
and
wresting
a
halbert
from
the
foremost
of

not

it

cried
demdike
in
a
voice
of
thunder
and
fixing
a
terrible
glance
upon
him
cum
on
wizard
rejoined
ashbead
undauntedly
but
observing
that
his
opponent
was
wholly
unarmed
he
gave
the
pike
to
hal
o
nabs
who
was
close
beside
him
observing
it
shall
never

that
cuthbert
ashbead
feawt

unfairly
nah
touch
me
if
theaw
demdike
required
no
further
provocation
with
almost
supernatural
force
and
quickness
he
sprung
upon
the
forester
and
seized
him
by
the
throat
but
the
active
young
man
freed
himself
from
the
gripe
and
closed
with
his
assailant
but
though
of
herculean
build
it
soon
became
evident
that
ashbead
would
have
the
worst
of
it
when
hal
o
nabs
who
had
watched
the
struggle
with
intense
interest
could
not
help
coming
to
his
friend
assistance
and
made
a
push
at
demdike
with
the
halbert
could
it
be
that
the
wrestlers
shifted
their
position
or
that
the
wizard
was
indeed
aided
by
the
powers
of
darkness
none
could
tell
but
so
it
was
that
the
pike
pierced
the
side
of
ashbead
who
instantly
fell
to
the
ground
with
his
adversary
upon
him
the
next
instant
his
hold
relaxed
and
the
wizard
sprang
to
his
feet
unharmed
but
deluged
in
blood
hal
o
nabs
uttered
a
cry
of
keenest
anguish
and
flinging
himself
upon
the
body
of
the
forester
tried
to
staunch
the
wound
but
he
was
quickly
seized
by
the
arquebussiers
and
his
hands
tied
behind
his
back
with
a
thong
while
ashbead
was
lifted
up
and
borne
towards
the
abbey
the
monks
and
rustics
following
slowly
after
but
the
latter
were
not
permitted
to
enter
the
gate
as
the
unfortunate
keeper
who
by
this
time
had
become
insensible
from
loss
of
blood
was
carried
along
the
walled
enclosure
leading
to
the
abbot
lodging
a
female
with
a
child
in
her
arms
was
seen
advancing
from
the
opposite
side
she
was
tall
finely
formed
with
features
of
remarkable
beauty
though
of
a
masculine
and
somewhat
savage
character
and
with
magnificent
but
fierce
black
eyes
her
skin
was
dark
and
her
hair
raven
black
contrasting
strongly
with
the
red
band
wound
around
it
her
kirtle
was
of
serge
simply
but
becomingly
fashioned
a
glance
sufficed
to
show
her
how
matters
stood
with
poor
ashbead
and
uttering
a
sharp
angry
cry
she
rushed
towards
him
what
have
you
done
she
cried
fixing
a
keen
reproachful
look
on
demdike
who
walked
beside
the
wounded
man
nothing
replied
demdike
with
a
bitter
laugh
the
fool

been
hurt
with
a
pike

demdike
fiercely

him
go
to
the
infirmary
ha
i

there
is
no
one
there
now
father
bancroft
is
at
the
gate
observed
one
of
the
arquebussiers
he
used
to
act
as
chirurgeon
in
the
abbey
no
monk
must
enter
the
gate
except
the
prisoners
when
they
arrive
observed
assheton
such
are
the
positive
orders
of
the
earl
of
derby
it
is
not
needed
observed
demdike
no
human
aid
can
save
the
man
but
can
other
aid
save
him
said
bess
breathing
the
words
in

cried
demdike
pushing
her
roughly
aside

said
bess
in
a
deep
whisper
if
thou
save
him
not
by
the
devil
thou
servest
thou
shalt
lose
me
and
thy
child
demdike
did
not
think
proper
to
contest
the
point
but
approaching
assheton
requested
that
the
wounded
man
might
be
conveyed
to
an
arched
recess
which
he
pointed
out
assent
being
given
ashbead
was
taken
there
and
placed
upon
the
ground
after
which
the
arquebussiers
and
their
leader
marched
off
while
bess
kneeling
down
supported
the
head
of
the
wounded
man
upon
her
knee
and
demdike
taking
a
small
phial
from
his
doublet
poured
some
of
its
contents
clown
his
throat
the
wizard
then
took
a
fold
of
linen
with
which
he
was
likewise
provided
and
dipping
it
in
the
elixir
applied
it
to
the
wound
in
a
few
moments
ashbead
opened
his
eyes
and
looking
round
wildly
fixed
his
gaze
upon
bess
who
placed
her
finger
upon
her
lips
to
enjoin
silence
but
he
could
not

groaned
the

held
the

towards

but
before

could
place
his
hands
upon

all
power
forsook
him
and
he
fell
back
and
expired

lost

cried
bess
with
a
wild
shriek
at
this
moment
a
loud
blast
was
blown
from
the
and
a
trumpeter
called
out
the
abbot
and
the
two
other
prisoners
are
coming
to

demdike
imperiously
and
seizing
the
bewildered

by
the
arm
to
thy
feet
and
come
with
me
to
meet
him
chapter
the
malediction
the
captive
ecclesiastics
together
with
the
strong
escort
by
which
they
were
attended
under
the
command
of
john
braddyll
the
high
sheriff
of
the
county
had
passed
the
previous
night
at
whitewell
in
bowland
forest
and
the
abbot
before
setting
out
on
his
final
journey
was
permitted
to
spend
an
hour
in
prayer
in
a
little
chapel
on
an
adjoining
hill
overlooking
a
most
picturesque
portion
of
the
forest
the
beauties
of
which
were
enhanced
by
the
windings
of
the
hodder
one
of
the
loveliest
streams
in
lancashire
his
devotions
performed
paslew
attended
by
a
guard
slowly
descended
the
hill
and
gazed
his
last
on
scenes
familiar
to
him
almost
from
infancy
noble
trees
which
now
looked
like
old
friends
to
whom
he
was
bidding
an
eternal
adieu
stood
around
him
beneath
them
at
the
end
of
a
glade
couched
a
herd
of
deer
which
started
off
at
sight
of
the
intruders
and
made
him
envy
their
freedom
and
fleetness
as
he
followed
them
in
thought
to
their
solitudes
at
the
foot
of
a
steep
rock
ran
the
hodder
making
the
pleasant
music
of
other
days
as
it
dashed
over
its
pebbly
bed
and
recalling
times
when
free
from
all
care
he
had
strayed
by
its
banks
to
listen
to
the
pleasant
sound
of
running
waters
and
watch
the
shining
pebbles
beneath
them
and
the
swift
trout
and
dainty
umber
glancing
past
a
bitter
pang
was
it
to
part
with
scenes
so
fair
and
the
abbot
spoke
no
word
nor
even
looked
up
until
passing
little
mitton
he
came
in
sight
of
whalley
abbey
then
collecting
all
his
energies
he
prepared
for
the
shock
he
was
about
to
endure
but
nerved
as
he
was
his
firmness
was
sorely
tried
when
he
beheld
the
stately
pile
once
his
own
now
gone
from
him
and
his
for
ever
he
gave
one
fond
glance
towards
it
and
then
painfully
averting
his
gaze
recited
in
a
low
voice
this
supplication
mei
deus
secundum
magnam
misericordiam
tuam
et
secundum
multitudinem
miserationum
tuarum
dele
iniquitatem
meam
amplius
lava
me
ab
iniquitate
meâ
et
à
peccato
meo
munda
but
other
thoughts
and
other
emotions
crowded
upon
him
when
he
beheld
the
groups
of
his
old
retainers
advancing
to
meet
him
men
women
and
children
pouring
forth
loud
lamentations
prostrating
themselves
at
his
feet
and
deploring
his
doom
the
abbot
fortitude
had
a
severe
trial
here
and
the
tears
sprung
to
his
eyes
the
devotion
of
these
poor
people
touched
him
more
sharply
than
the
severity
of
his
adversaries
bless
ye
bless
ye
my
children
he
cried
repine
not
for
me
for
i
bear
my
cross
with
resignation
it
is
for
me
to
bewail
your
lot
much
fearing
that
the
flock
i
have
so
long
and
so
zealously
tended
will
fall
into
the
hands
of
other
and
less
heedful
pastors
or
still
worse
of
devouring
wolves
bless
ye
my
children
and
be
comforted
think
of
the
end
of
abbot
paslew
and
for
what
he
suffered
think
that
he
was
a
traitor
to
the
king
and
took
up
arms
in
rebellion
against
him
cried
the
sheriff
riding
up
and
speaking
in
a
loud
voice
and
that
for
his
heinous
offences
he
was
justly
condemned
to
death
murmurs
arose
at
this
speech
but
they
were
instantly
checked
by
the
escort
think
charitably
of
me
my
children
said
the
abbot
and
the
blessed
virgin
keep
you
steadfast
in
your
faith
benedicite
be
silent
traitor
i
command
thee
cried
the
sheriff
striking
him
with
his
gauntlet
in
the
face
the
abbot
pale
check
burnt
crimson
and
his
eye
flashed
fire
but
he
controlled
himself
and
answered
meekly
thou
didst
not
speak
in
such
wise
john
braddyll
when
i
saved
thee
from
the
flood
which
flood
thou
thyself
caused
to
burst
forth
by
devilish
arts
rejoined
the
sheriff
i
owe
thee
little
for
the
service
if
for
naught
else
thou
deservest
death
for
thy
evil
doings
on
that
night
the
abbot
made
no
reply
for
braddyll
allusion
conjured
up
a
sombre
train
of
thought
within
his
breast
awakening
apprehensions
which
he
could
neither
account
for
nor
shake
off
meanwhile
the
cavalcade
slowly
approached
the
gateway
of
the
abbey
passing
through
crowds
of
kneeling
and
sorrowing
bystanders
but
so
deeply
was
the
abbot
engrossed
by
the
one
dread
idea
that
possessed
him
that
he
saw
them
not
and
scarce
heard
their
woful
lamentations
all
at
once
the
cavalcade
stopped
and
the
sheriff
rode
on
to
the
gate
in
the
opening
of
which
some
ceremony
was
observed
then
it
was
that
paslew
raised
his
eyes
and
beheld
standing
before
him
a
tall
man
with
a
woman
beside
him
bearing
an
infant
in
her
arms
the
eyes
of
the
pair
were
fixed
upon
him
with
vindictive
exultation
he
would
have
averted
his
gaze
but
an
irresistible
fascination
withheld
him
thou
seest
all
is
prepared
said
demdike
coming
close
up
the
mule
on
which
paslew
was
mounted
and
pointing
to
the
gigantic
gallows
looming
above
the
abbey
walls
wilt
them
now
accede
to
my
request
and
then
he
added
significantly
on
the
same
terms
as
before
the
abbot
understood
his
meaning
well
life
and
freedom
were
offered
him
by
a
being
whose
power
to
accomplish
his
promise
he
did
not
doubt
the
struggle
was
hard
but
he
resisted
the
temptation
and
answered
firmly
no
then
die
the
felon
death
thou
meritest
cried
bess
fiercely
and
i
will
glut
mine
eyes
with
the
spectacle
incensed
beyond
endurance
the
abbot
looked
sternly
at
her
and
raised
his
hand
in
denunciation
the
action
and
the
look
were
so
appalling
that
the
affrighted
woman
would
have
fled
if
her
husband
had
not
restrained
her
by
the
holy
patriarchs
and
prophets
by
the
prelates
and
confessors
by
the
doctors
of
the
church
by
the
holy
abbots
monks
and
eremites
who
dwelt
in
solitudes
in
mountains
and
in
caverns
by
the
holy
saints
and
martyrs
who
suffered
torture
and
death
for
their
faith
i
curse
thee
witch
cried
paslew
may
the
malediction
of
heaven
and
all
its
hosts
alight
on
the
head
of
thy
infant
oh
holy
abbot
shrieked
bess
breaking
from
her
husband
and
flinging
herself
at
paslew
feet
curse
me
if
thou
wilt
but
spare
my
innocent
child
save
it
and
we
will
save
thee
avoid
thee
wretched
and
impious
woman
rejoined
the
abbot
i
have
pronounced
the
dread
anathema
and
it
can
not
be
recalled
look
at
the
dripping
garments
of
thy
child
in
blood
has
it
been
baptised
and
through
paths
shall
its
course
be
taken
ha
shrieked
bess
noticing
for
the
first
time
the
ensanguined
condition
of
the
infant
attire
cuthbert
blood
oh
listen
to
me
wicked
woman
pursued
the
abbot
as
if
filled
with
a
prophetic
spirit
thy
child
life
shall
be
long
beyond
the
ordinary
term
of
woman
but
it
shall
be
a
life
of
woe
and
oh
stay
him
stay
him
or
i
shall
die
cried
bess
but
the
wizard
could
not
speak
a
greater
power
than
his
own
apparently
overmastered
him
children
shall
she
have
continued
the
abbot
and
children
but
they
shall
be
a
race
doomed
and
accursed
a
brood
of
adders
that
the
world
shall
flee
from
and
crush
a
thing
accursed
and
shunned
by
her
fellows
shall
thy
daughter
be
evil
reputed
and
evil
doing
no
hand
to
help
her
no
lip
to
bless
her
life
a
burden
and
death
long
long
in
coming
finding
her
in
a
dismal
dungeon
now
depart
from
me
and
trouble
me
no
more
bess
made
a
motion
as
if
she
would
go
and
then
turning
partly
round
dropped
heavily
on
the
ground
demdike
caught
the
child
ere
she
fell
thou
hast
killed
her
he
cried
to
the
abbot
a
stronger
voice
than
mine
hath
spoken
if
it
be
so
rejoined
paslew
miserrime
fuge
malefice
quia
judex
adest
at
this
moment
the
trumpet
again
sounded
and
the
cavalcade
being
put
in
motion
the
abbot
and
his
passed
through
the
gate
dismounting
from
their
mules
within
the
court
before
the
the
captive
ecclesiastics
preceded
by
the
sheriff
were
led
to
the
principal
chamber
of
the
structure
where
the
earl
of
derby
awaited
them
seated
in
the
gothic
carved
oak
chair
formerly
occupied
by
the
abbots
of
whalley
on
the
occasions
of
conferences
or
elections
the
earl
was
surrounded
by
his
officers
and
the
chamber
was
filled
with
armed
men
the
abbot
slowly
advanced
towards
the
earl
his
deportment
was
dignified
and
firm
even
majestic
the
exaltation
of
spirit
occasioned
by
the
interview
with
demdike
and
his
wife
had
passed
away
and
was
succeeded
by
a
profound
calm
the
hue
of
his
cheek
was
livid
but
otherwise
he
seemed
wholly
unmoved
the
ceremony
of
delivering
up
the
bodies
of
the
prisoners
to
the
earl
was
gone
through
by
the
sheriff
and
their
sentences
were
then
read
aloud
by
a
clerk
after
this
the
earl
who
had
hitherto
remained
covered
took
off
his
cap
and
in
a
solemn
voice
spoke
john
paslew
somewhile
abbot
of
whalley
but
now
an
attainted
and
condemned
felon
and
john
eastgate
and
william
haydocke
formerly
brethren
of
the
same
monastery
and
confederates
with
him
in
crime
ye
have
heard
your
doom
you
shall
die
the
ignominious
death
of
traitors
but
the
king
in
his
mercy
having
regard
not
so
much
to
the
heinous
nature
of
your
offences
towards
his
sovereign
majesty
as
to
the
sacred
offices
you
once
held
and
of
which
you
have
been
shamefully
deprived
is
graciously
pleased
to
remit
that
part
of
your
sentence
whereby
ye
are
condemned
to
be
quartered
alive
willing
that
the
hearts
which
conceived
so
much
malice
and
violence
against
him
should
cease
to
beat
within
your
own
bosoms
and
that
the
arms
which
were
raised
in
rebellion
against
him
should
be
interred
in
one
common
grave
with
the
trunks
to
which
they
belong
god
save
the
high
and
puissant
king
henry
the
eighth
and
free
him
from
all
traitors
cried
the
clerk
we
humbly
thank
his
majesty
for
his
clemency
said
the
abbot
amid
the
profound
silence
that
ensued
and
i
pray
you
my
good
lord
when
you
shall
write
to
the
king
concerning
us
to
say
to
his
majesty
that
we
died
penitent
of
many
and
grave
offences
amongst
the
which
is
chiefly
that
of
having
taken
up
arms
unlawfully
against
him
but
that
we
did
so
solely
with
the
view
of
freeing
his
highness
from
evil
counsellors
and
of
our
holy
church
for
the
which
we
would
willingly
die
if
our
death
might
in
anywise
profit
it
amen
exclaimed
father
eastgate
who
stood
with
his
hands
crossed
upon
his
breast
close
behind
paslew
the
abbot
hath
uttered
my
sentiments
he
hath
not
uttered
mine
cried
father
haydocke
i
ask
no
grace
from
the
bloody
herodias
and
will
accept
none
what
i
have
done
i
would
do
again
were
the
past
to
return
nay
i
would
do
more
i
would
find
a
way
to
reach
the
tyrant
heart
and
thus
free
our
church
from
its
worst
enemy
and
the
land
from
a
ruthless
oppressor
remove
him
said
the
earl
the
vile
traitor
shall
be
dealt
with
as
he
merits
for
you
he
added
as
the
order
was
obeyed
and
addressing
the
other
prisoners
and
especially
you
john
paslew
who
have
shown
some
compunction
for
your
crimes
and
to
prove
to
you
that
the
king
is
not
the
ruthless
tyrant
he
hath
been
just
represented
i
hereby
in
his
name
promise
you
any
boon
which
you
may
ask
consistently
with
your
situation
what
favour
would
you
have
shown
you
the
abbot
reflected
for
a
moment
speak
thou
john
eastgate
said
the
earl
of
derby
seeing
that
the
abbot
was
occupied
in
thought
if
i
may
proffer
a
request
my
lord
replied
the
monk
it
is
that
our
poor
distraught
brother
william
haydocke
be
spared
the
quartering
block
he
meant
not
what
he
said
well
be
it
as
thou
wilt
replied
the
earl
bending
his
brows
though
he
ill
deserves
such
grace
now
john
paslew
what
wouldst
thou
thus
addressed
the
abbot
looked
up
i
would
have
made
the
same
request
as
my
brother
john
eastgate
if
he
had
not
anticipated
me
my
lord
said
paslew
but
since
his
petition
is
granted
i
would
on
my
own
part
entreat
that
mass
be
said
for
us
in
the
convent
church
many
of
the
brethren
are
without
the
abbey
and
if
permitted
will
assist
at
its
performance
i
know
not
if
i
shall
not
incur
the
king
displeasure
in
assenting
replied
the
earl
of
derby
after
a
little
reflection
but
i
will
hazard
it
mass
for
the
dead
shall
be
said
in
the
church
at
midnight
and
all
the
brethren
who
choose
to
come
thither
shall
be
permitted
to
assist
at
it
they
will
attend
i
doubt
not
for
it
will
be
the
last
time
the
rites
of
the
romish
church
will
be
performed
in
those
walls
they
shall
have
all
required
for
the
ceremonial
heaven
blessings
on
you
my
lord
said
the
abbot
but
first
pledge
me
your
sacred
word
said
the
earl
by
the
holy
office
you
once
held
and
by
the
saints
in
whom
you
trust
that
this
concession
shall
not
be
made
the
means
of
any
attempt
at
flight
i
swear
it
replied
the
abbot
earnestly
and
i
also
swear
it
added
father
eastgate
enough
said
the
earl
i
will
give
the
requisite
orders
notice
of
the
celebration
of
mass
at
midnight
shall
be
proclaimed
without
the
abbey
now
remove
the
prisoners
upon
this
the
captive
ecclesiastics
were
led
forth
father
eastgate
was
taken
to
a
strong
room
in
the
lower
part
of
the
where
all
acts
of
discipline
had
been
performed
by
the
monks
and
where
the
knotted
lash
the
spiked
girdle
and
the
hair
shirt
had
once
hung
while
the
abbot
was
conveyed
to
his
old
chamber
which
had
been
prepared
for
his
reception
and
there
left
alone
chapter
the
midnight
mass
dolefully
sounds
the
all
souls
bell
from
the
tower
of
the
convent
church
the
bell
is
one
of
five
and
has
obtained
the
name
because
it
is
tolled
only
for
those
about
to
pass
away
from
life
now
it
rings
the
knell
of
three
souls
to
depart
on
the
morrow
brightly
illumined
is
the
fane
within
which
no
taper
hath
gleamed
since
the
old
worship
ceased
showing
that
preparations
are
made
for
the
last
service
the
organ
dumb
so
long
breathes
a
low
prelude
sad
is
it
to
hear
that
knell
sad
to
view
those
panes
and
to
think
why
the
one
rings
and
the
other
is
lighted
up
word
having
gone
forth
of
the
midnight
mass
all
the
ejected
brethren
flock
to
the
abbey
some
have
toiled
through
miry
and
scarce
passable
roads
others
have
come
down
from
the
hills
and
forded
deep
streams
at
the
hazard
of
life
rather
than
go
round
by
the
bridge
and
arrive
too
late
others
who
conceive
themselves
in
peril
from
the
share
they
have
taken
in
the
late
insurrection
quit
their
secure
retreats
and
expose
themselves
to
capture
it
may
be
a
snare
laid
for
them
but
they
run
the
risk
others
coming
from
a
yet
greater
distance
beholding
the
illuminated
church
from
afar
and
catching
the
sound
of
the
bell
tolling
at
intervals
hurry
on
and
reach
the
gate
breathless
and
wellnigh
exhausted
but
no
questions
are
asked
all
who
present
themselves
in
ecclesiastical
habits
are
permitted
to
enter
and
take
part
in
the
procession
forming
in
the
cloister
or
proceed
at
once
to
the
church
if
they
prefer
it
dolefully
sounds
the
bell
barefooted
brethren
meet
together
sorrowfully
salute
each
other
and
form
in
a
long
line
in
the
great
area
of
the
cloisters
at
their
head
are
six
monks
bearing
tall
lighted
candles
after
them
come
the
quiristers
and
then
one
carrying
the
host
between
the
next
comes
a
youth
holding

bell
next
are
placed
the
dignitaries
of
the
church
the
prior
ranking
first
and
the
others
standing
two
and
two
according
to
their
degrees
near
the
entrance
of
the
refectory
which
occupies
the
whole
south
side
of
the
quadrangle
stand
a
band
of
halberdiers
whose
torches
cast
a
ruddy
glare
on
the
opposite
tower
and
buttresses
of
the
convent
church
revealing
the
statues
not
yet
plucked
from
their
niches
the
crosses
on
the
pinnacles
and
the
gilt
image
of

gregory

porch
another
band
are
stationed
near
the
mouth
of
the
vaulted
passage
under
the
and
vestry
whose
grey
irregular
walls
pierced
by
numberless
richly
ornamented
windows
and
surmounted
by
small
turrets
form
a
beautiful
boundary
on
the
right
while
a
third
party
are
planted
on
the
left
in
the
open
space
beneath
the
dormitory
the
torchlight
flashing
ruddily
upon
the
hoary
pillars
and
groined
arches
sustaining
the
vast
structure
above
them
dolefully
sounds
the
bell
and
the
ghostly
procession
thrice
tracks
the
four
ambulatories
of
the
cloisters
solemnly
chanting
a
requiem
for
the
dead
dolefully
sounds
the
bell
and
at
its
summons
all
the
old
retainers
of
the
abbot
press
to
the
gate
and
sue
for
admittance
but
in
vain
they
therefore
mount
the
neighbouring
hill
commanding
the
abbey
and
as
the
solemn
sounds
float
faintly
by
and
glimpses
are
caught
of
the
brethren
gliding
along
the
cloisters
and
rendered
by
the
torchlight
the
beholders
half
imagine
it
must
be
a
company
of
sprites
and
that
the
departed
monks
have
been
permitted
for
an
hour
to
assume
their
old
forms
and
revisit
their
old
haunts
dolefully
sounds
the
bell
and
two
biers
covered
with
palls
are
borne
slowly
towards
the
church
followed
by
a
tall
monk
the
clock
was
on
the
stroke
of
twelve
the
procession
having
drawn
up
within
the
court
in
front
of
the
abbot
lodging
the
prisoners
were
brought
forth
and
at
sight
of
the
abbot
the
whole
of
the
monks
fell
on
their
knees
a
touching
sight
was
it
to
see
those
reverend
men
prostrate
before
their
ancient
superior
he
condemned
to
die
and
they
deprived
of
their
monastic
home
and
the
officer
had
not
the
heart
to
interfere
deeply
affected
paslew
advanced
to
the
prior
and
raising
him
affectionately
embraced
him
after
this
he
addressed
some
words
of
comfort
to
the
others
who
arose
as
he
enjoined
them
and
at
a
signal
from
the
officer
the
procession
set
out
for
the
church

his
fellow
captives

guard

bell
tolled
dolefully
the
while
meanwhile
an
officer
entered
the
great
hall
where
the
earl
of
derby
was
feasting
with
his
retainers
and
informed
him
that
the
hour
appointed
for
the
ceremonial
was
close
at
hand
the
earl
arose
and
went
to
the
church
attended
by
braddyll
and
assheton
he
entered
by
the
western
porch
and
proceeding
to
the
choir
seated
himself
in
the
stall
formerly
used
by
paslew
and
placed
where
it
stood
a
hundred
years
before
by
john
eccles
ninth
abbot
midnight
struck
the
great
door
of
the
church
swung
open
and
the
organ
pealed
forth
the
the
aisles
were
filled
with
armed
men
but
a
clear
space
was
left
for
the
procession
which
presently
entered
in
the
same
order
as
before
and
moved
slowly
along
the
transept
those
who
came
first
thought
it
a
dream
so
strange
was
it
to
find
themselves
once
again
in
the
old
accustomed
church
the
good
prior
melted
into
tears
at
length
the
abbot
came
to
him
the
whole
scene
appeared
like
a
vision
the
lights
streaming
from
the
altar
the
incense
loading
the
air
the
deep
diapasons
rolling
overhead
the
faces
of
the
brethren
the
familiar
aspect
of
the
sacred
edifice
all
these
filled
him
with
emotions
too
painful
almost
for
endurance
it
was
the
last
time
he
should
visit
this
holy
place
the
last
time
he
should
hear
those
solemn
sounds
the
last
time
he
should
behold
those
familiar
objects
ay
the
last
death
could
have
no
pang
like
this
and
with
heart
wellnigh
bursting
and
limbs
scarcely
serving
their
office
he
tottered
on
another
trial
awaited
him
and
one
for
which
he
was
wholly
unprepared
as
he
drew
near
the
chancel
he
looked
down
an
opening
on
the
right
which
seemed
purposely
preserved
by
the
guard
why
were
those
tapers
burning
in
the
side
chapel
what
was
within
it
he
looked
again
and
beheld
two
uncovered
biers
on
one
lay
the
body
of
a
woman
he
started
in
the
beautiful
but
fierce
features
of
the
dead
he
beheld
the
witch
bess
demdike
she
was
gone
to
her
account
before
him
the
malediction
he
had
pronounced
upon
her
child
had
killed
her
appalled
he
turned
to
the
other
bier
and
recognised
cuthbert
ashbead
he
shuddered
but
comforted
himself
that
he
was
at
least
guiltless
of
his
death
though
he
had
a
strange
feeling
that
the
poor
forester
had
in
some
way
perished
for
him
but
his
attention
was
diverted
towards
a
tall
monk
in
the
cistertian
habit
standing
between
the
bodies
with
the
cowl
drawn
over
his
face
as
paslew
gazed
at
him
the
monk
slowly
raised
his
hood
and
partially
disclosed
features
that
smote
the
abbot
as
if
he
had
beheld
a
spectre
could
it
be
could
fancy
cheat
him
thus
he
looked
again
the
monk
was
still
standing
there
but
the
cowl
had
dropped
over
his
face
striving
to
shake
off
the
horror
that
possessed
him
the
abbot
staggered
forward
and
reaching
the
presbytery
sank
upon
his
knees
the
ceremonial
then
commenced
the
solemn
requiem
was
sung
by
the
choir
and
three
yet
living
heard
the
hymn
for
the
repose
of
their
souls
always
deeply
impressive
the
service
was
unusually
so
on
this
sad
occasion
and
the
melodious
voices
of
the
singers
never
sounded
so
mournfully
sweet
as
then
the
demeanour
of
the
prior
never
seemed
so
dignified
nor
his
accents
so
touching
and
solemn
the
sternest
hearts
were
softened
but
the
abbot
found
it
impossible
to
fix
his
attention
on
the
service
the
lights
at
the
altar
burnt
dimly
in
his
eyes
the
loud
antiphon
and
the
supplicatory
prayer
fell
upon
a
listless
ear
his
whole
life
was
passing
in
review
before
him
he
saw
himself
as
he
was
when
he
first
professed
his
faith
and
felt
the
zeal
and
holy
aspirations
that
filled
him
then
years
flew
by
at
a
glance
and
he
found
himself
the
became
deacon
and
the
deacon
and
the
end
of
his
ambition
seemed
plain
before
him
but
he
had
a
rival
his
fears
told
him
a
superior
in
zeal
and
learning
one
who
though
many
years
younger
than
he
had
risen
so
rapidly
in
favour
with
the
ecclesiastical
authorities
that
he
threatened
to
outstrip
him
even
now
when
the
goal
was
full
in
view
the
darkest
passage
of
his
life
approached
a
crime
which
should
cast
a
deep
shadow
over
the
whole
of
his
brilliant
he
would
have
shunned
its
contemplation
if
he
could
in
vain
it
stood
out
more
palpably
than
all
the
rest
his
rival
was
no
longer
in
his
path
how
he
was
removed
the
abbot
did
not
dare
to
think
but
he
was
gone
for
ever
unless
the
tall
monk
were
he
unable
to
endure
this
terrible
retrospect
paslew
strove
to
bend
his
thoughts
on
other
things
the
choir
was
singing
the
and
their
voices
thundered
forth
rex
tremendæ
majestatis
qui
salvandos
salvas
gratis
salva
me
fons
pietatis
fain
would
the
abbot
have
closed
his
ears
and
hoping
to
stifle
the
remorseful
pangs
that
seized
upon
his
very
vitals
with
the
sharpness
of
serpents
teeth
he
strove
to
dwell
upon
the
frequent
and
severe
acts
of
penance
he
had
performed
but
he
now
found
that
his
penitence
had
never
been
sincere
and
efficacious
this
one
damning
sin
obscured
all
his
good
actions
and
he
felt
if
he
died
unconfessed
and
with
the
weight
of
guilt
upon
his
soul
he
should
perish
everlastingly
again
he
fled
from
the
torment
of
retrospection
and
again
heard
the
choir
thundering
forth
lacrymosa
dies
illa
quâ
resurget
ex
favillâ
judicandus
homo
reus
huic
ergo
parce
deus
pie
jesu
domine
dona
eis
requiem
amen
exclaimed
the
abbot
and
bowing
his
head
to
the
ground
he
earnestly
repeated
pie
jesu
domine
dona
eis
requiem
then
he
looked
up
and
resolved
to
ask
for
a
confessor
and
unburthen
his
soul
without
delay
the
offertory
and
were
over
the
in
awful
words
addressed
to
living
ears
were
pronounced
and
the
mass
was
ended
all
prepared
to
depart
the
prior
descended
from
the
altar
to
embrace
and
take
leave
of
the
abbot
and
at
the
same
time
the
earl
of
derby
came
from
the
stall
has
all
been
done
to
your
satisfaction
john
paslew
demanded
the
earl
as
he
drew
near
all
my
good
lord
replied
the
abbot
lowly
inclining
his
head
and
i
pray
you
think
me
not
importunate
if
i
prefer
one
other
request
i
would
fain
have
a
confessor
visit
me
that
i
may
lay
bare
my
inmost
heart
to
him
and
receive
absolution
i
have
already
anticipated
the
request
replied
the
earl
and
have
provided
a
priest
for
you
he
shall
attend
you
within
an
hour
in
your
own
chamber
you
will
have
ample
time
between
this
and
daybreak
to
settle
your
accounts
with
heaven
should
they
be
ever
so
weighty
i
trust
so
my
lord
replied
paslew
but
a
whole
life
is
scarcely
long
enough
for
repentance
much
less
a
few
short
hours
but
in
regard
to
the
confessor
he
continued
filled
with
misgiving
by
the
manner
i
should
be
glad
to
be
shriven
by
father
christopher
smith
late
prior
of
the
abbey
it
may
not
be
replied
the
earl
sternly
and
decidedly
you
will
find
all
you
can
require
in
him
i
shall
send
the
abbot
sighed
seeing
that
remonstrance
was
useless
one
further
question
i
would
address
to
you
my
lord
he
said
and
that
refers
to
the
place
of
my
interment
beneath
our
feet
lie
buried
all
my
predecessors
abbots
of
whalley
here
lies
john
eccles
for
whom
was
carved
the
stall
in
which
your
lordship
hath
sat
and
from
which
i
have
been
dethroned
here
rests
the
learned
john
lyndelay
fifth
abbot
and
beside
him
his
immediate
predecessor
robert
de
topcliffe
who
two
hundred
and
thirty
years
ago
on
the
festival
of
saint
gregory
our
canonised
abbot
commenced
the
erection
of
the
sacred
edifice
above
us
at
that
epoch
were
here
enshrined
the
remains
of
the
saintly
gregory
and
here
were
also
brought
the
bodies
of
helias
de
workesley
and
john
de
belfield
both
prelates
of
piety
and
wisdom
you
may
read
the
names
where
you
stand
my
lord
you
may
count
the
graves
of
all
the
abbots
they
are
sixteen
in
number
there
is
one
grave
yet
unoccupied
one
stone
yet
unfurnished
with
an
effigy
in
brass
well
said
the
earl
of
derby
when
i
sat
in
that
stall
my
lord
pursued
paslew
pointing
to
the
abbot
chair
when
i
was
head
of
this
church
it
was
my
thought
to
rest
here
among
my
brother
abbots
you
have
forfeited
the
right
replied
the
earl
sternly
all
the
abbots
whose
dust
is
crumbling
beneath
us
died
in
the
odour
of
sanctity
loyal
to
their
sovereigns
and
true
to
their
country
whereas
you
will
die
an
attainted
felon
and
rebel
you
can
have
no
place
amongst
them
concern
not
yourself
further
in
the
matter
i
will
find
a
fitting
grave
for
you
perchance
at
the
foot
of
the
gallows
and
turning
abruptly
away
he
gave
the
signal
for
general
departure
ere
the
clock
in
the
church
tower
had
tolled
one
the
lights
were
extinguished
and
of
the
priestly
train
who
had
recently
thronged
the
fane
all
were
gone
like
a
troop
of
ghosts
evoked
at
midnight
by
necromantic
skill
and
then
suddenly
dismissed
deep
silence
again
brooded
in
the
aisles
hushed
was
the
organ
mute
the
melodious
choir
the
only
light
penetrating
the
convent
church
proceeded
from
the
moon
whose
rays
shining
through
the
painted
windows
fell
upon
the
graves
of
the
old
abbots
in
the
presbytery
and
on
the
two
biers
within
the
adjoining
chapel
whose
stark
burthens
they
quickened
into
fearful
semblance
of
life
chapter
teter
et
fortis
carcer
left
alone
and
unable
to
pray
the
abbot
strove
to
dissipate
his
agitation
of
spirit
by
walking
to
and
fro
within
his
chamber
and
while
thus
occupied
he
was
interrupted
by
a
guard
who
told
him
that
the
priest
sent
by
the
earl
of
derby
was
without
and
immediately
afterwards
the
confessor
was
ushered
in
it
was
the
tall
monk
who
had
been
standing
between
the
biers
and
his
features
were
still
shrouded
by
his
cowl
at
sight
of
him
paslew
sank
upon
a
seat
and
buried
his
face
in
his
hands
the
monk
offered
him
no
consolation
but
waited
in
silence
till
he
should
again
look
up
at
last
paslew
took
courage
and
spoke
who
and
what
are
you
he
demanded
a
brother
of
the
same
order
as
yourself
replied
the
monk
in
deep
and
thrilling
accents
but
without
raising
his
hood
and
i
am
come
to
hear
your
confession
by
command
of
the
earl
of
derby
are
you
of
this
abbey
asked
paslew
tremblingly
i
was
replied
the
monk
in
a
stern
tone
but
the
monastery
is
dissolved
and
all
the
brethren
ejected
your
name
cried
paslew
i
am
not
come
here
to
answer
questions
but
to
hear
a
confession
rejoined
the
monk
bethink
you
of
the
awful
situation
in
which
you
are
placed
and
that
before
many
hours
you
must
answer
for
the
sins
you
have
committed
you
have
yet
time
for
repentance
if
you
delay
it
not
you
are
right
father
replied
the
abbot
be
seated
i
pray
you
and
listen
to
me
for
i
have
much
to
tell
thirty
and
one
years
ago
i
was
prior
of
this
abbey
up
to
that
period
my
life
had
been
blameless
or
if
not
wholly
free
from
fault
i
had
little
wherewith
to
reproach
myself
little
to
fear
from
a
merciful
judge
unless
it
were
that
i
indulged
too
strongly
the
desire
of
ruling
absolutely
in
the
house
in
which
i
was
then
only
second
but
satan
had
laid
a
snare
for
me
into
which
i
blindly
fell
among
the
brethren
was
one
named
borlace
alvetham
a
young
man
of
rare
attainment
and
singular
skill
in
the
occult
sciences
he
had
risen
in
favour
and
at
the
time
i
speak
of
was
elected
go
on
said
the
monk
it
began
to
be
whispered
about
within
the
abbey
pursued
paslew
that
on
the
death
of
william
rede
then
abbot
borlace
alvetham
would
succeed
him
and
then
it
was
that
bitter
feelings
of
animosity
were
awakened
in
my
breast
against
the
and
after
many
struggles
i
resolved
upon
his
destruction
a
wicked
resolution
cried
the
monk
but
proceed
i
pondered
over
the
means
of
accomplishing
my
purpose
resumed
paslew
and
at
last
decided
upon
accusing
alvetham
of
sorcery
and
magical
practices
the
accusation
was
easy
for
the
occult
studies
in
which
he
indulged
laid
him
open
to
the
charge
he
occupied
a
chamber
overlooking
the
calder
and
used
to
break
the
monastic
rules
by
wandering
forth
at
night
upon
the
hills
when
he
was
absent
thus
one
night
accompanied
by
others
of
the
brethren
i
visited
his
chamber
and
examined
his
papers
some
of
which
were
covered
with
mystical
figures
and
cabalistic
characters
these
papers
i
seized
and
a
watch
was
set
to
make
prisoner
of
alvetham
on
his
return
before
dawn
he
appeared
and
was
instantly
secured
and
placed
in
close
confinement
on
the
next
day
he
was
brought
before
the
assembled
conclave
in
the
and
examined
his
defence
was
unavailing
i
charged
him
with
the
terrible
crime
of
witchcraft
and
he
was
found
guilty
a
hollow
groan
broke
from
the
monk
but
he
offered
no
other
interruption
he
was
condemned
to
die
a
fearful
and
lingering
death
pursued
the
abbot
and
it
devolved
upon
me
to
see
the
sentence
carried
out
and
no
pity
for
the
innocent
moved
you
cried
the
monk
you
had
no
compunction
none
replied
the
abbot
i
rather
rejoiced
in
the
successful
accomplishment
of
my
scheme
the
prey
was
fairly
in
my
toils
and
i
would
give
him
no
chance
of
escape
not
to
bring
scandal
upon
the
abbey
it
was
decided
that
alvetham
punishment
should
be
secret
a
wise
resolve
observed
the
monk
within
the
thickness
of
the
dormitory
walls
is
contrived
a
small
dungeon
continued
the
abbot
it
consists
of
an
arched
cell
just
large
enough
to
hold
the
body
of
a
captive
and
permit
him
to
stretch
himself
upon
a
straw
pallet
a
narrow
staircase
mounts
upwards
to
a
grated
aperture
in
one
of
the
buttresses
to
admit
air
and
light
other
opening
is
there
none
et
fortis
is
this
dungeon
styled
in
our
monastic
rolls
and
it
is
well
described
for
it
is
black
and
strong
enough
food
is
admitted
to
the
miserable
inmate
of
the
cell
by
means
of
a
revolving
stone
but
no
interchange
of
speech
can
be
held
with
those
without
a
large
stone
is
removed
from
the
wall
to
admit
the
prisoner
and
once
immured
the
masonry
is
mortised
and
made
solid
as
before
the
wretched
captive
does
not
long
survive
his
doom
or
it
may
be
he
lives
too
long
for
death
must
be
a
release
from
such
protracted
misery
in
this
dark
cell
one
of
the
brethren
who
essayed
to
stab
the
abbot
of
kirkstall
in
the
was
thrust
and
ere
a
year
was
over
the
provisions
were
untouched
and
the
man
being
known
to
be
dead
they
were
stayed
his
skeleton
was
found
within
the
cell
when
it
was
opened
to
admit
borlace
alvetham
poor
captive
groaned
the
monk
ay
poor
captive
echoed
paslew
mine
eyes
have
often
striven
to
pierce
those
stone
walls
and
see
him
lying
there
in
that
narrow
chamber
or
forcing
his
way
upwards
to
catch
a
glimpse
of
the
blue
sky
above
him
when
i
have
seen
the
swallows
settle
on
the
old
buttress
or
the
thin
grass
growing
between
the
stones
waving
there
i
have
thought
of
him
go
on
said
the
monk
i
scarce
can
proceed
rejoined
paslew
little
time
was
allowed
alvetham
for
preparation
that
very
night
the
fearful
sentence
was
carried
out
the
stone
was
removed
and
a
new
pallet
placed
in
the
cell
at
midnight
the
prisoner
was
brought
to
the
dormitory
the
brethren
chanting
a
doleful
hymn
there
he
stood
amidst
them
his
tall
form
towering
above
the
rest
and
his
features
pale
as
death
he
protested
his
innocence
but
he
exhibited
no
fear
even
when
he
saw
the
terrible
preparations
when
all
was
ready
he
was
led
to
the
breach
at
that
awful
moment
his
eye
met
mine
and
i
shall
never
forget
the
look
i
might
have
saved
him
if
i
had
spoken
but
i
would
not
speak
i
turned
away
and
he
was
thrust
into
the
breach
a
fearful
cry
then
rang
in
my
ears
but
it
was
instantly
drowned
by
the
mallets
of
the
masons
employed
to
fasten
up
the
stone
there
was
a
pause
for
a
few
moments
broken
only
by
the
sobs
of
the
abbot
at
length
the
monk
spoke
and
the
prisoner
perished
in
the
cell
he
demanded
in
a
hollow
voice
i
thought
so
till
replied
the
abbot
but
if
he
escaped
it
it
must
have
been
by
miracle
or
by
aid
of
those
powers
with
whom
he
was
charged
with
holding
commerce
he
did
escape
thundered
the
monk
throwing
back
his
hood
look
up
john
paslew
look
up
false
abbot
and
recognise
thy
victim
borlace
alvetham
cried
the
abbot
is
it
indeed
you
you
see
and
can
you
doubt
replied
the
other
but
you
shall
now
hear
how
i
avoided
the
terrible
death
to
which
you
procured
my
condemnation
you
shall
now
learn
how
i
am
here
to
repay
the
wrong
you
did
me
we
have
changed
places
john
paslew
since
the
night
when
i
was
thrust
into
the
cell
never
as
you
hoped
to
come
forth
you
are
now
the
criminal
and
i
the
witness
of
the
punishment
forgive
me
oh
forgive
me
borlace
alvetham
since
you
are
indeed
he
cried
the
abbot
falling
on
his
knees
arise
john
paslew
cried
the
other
sternly
arise
and
listen
to
me
for
the
damning
offences
into
which
i
have
been
led
i
hold
you
responsible
but
for
you
i
might
have
died
free
from
sin
it
is
fit
you
should
know
the
amount
of
my
iniquity
give
ear
to
me
i
say
when
first
shut
within
that
dungeon
i
yielded
to
the
promptings
of
despair
cursing
you
i
threw
myself
upon
the
pallet
resolved
to
taste
no
food
and
hoping
death
would
soon
release
me
but
love
of
life
prevailed
on
the
second
day
i
took
the
bread
and
water
allotted
me
and
ate
and
drank
after
which
i
scaled
the
narrow
staircase
and
gazed
through
the
thin
barred
loophole
at
the
bright
blue
sky
above
sometimes
catching
the
shadow
of
a
bird
as
it
flew
past
oh
how
i
yearned
for
freedom
then
oh
how
i
wished
to
break
through
the
stone
walls
that
held
me
fast
oh
what
a
weight
of
despair
crushed
my
heart
as
i
crept
back
to
my
narrow
bed
the
cell
seemed
like
a
grave
and
indeed
it
was
little
better
horrible
thoughts
possessed
me
what
if
i
should
be
wilfully
forgotten
what
if
no
food
should
be
given
me
and
i
should
be
left
to
perish
by
the
slow
pangs
of
hunger
at
this
idea
i
shrieked
aloud
but
the
walls
alone
returned
a
dull
echo
to
my
cries
i
beat
my
hands
against
the
stones
till
the
blood
flowed
from
them
but
no
answer
was
returned
and
at
last
i
desisted
from
sheer
exhaustion
day
after
day
and
night
after
night
passed
in
this
way
my
food
regularly
came
but
i
became
maddened
by
solitude
and
with
terrible
imprecations
invoked
aid
from
the
powers
of
darkness
to
set
me
free
one
night
while
thus
employed
i
was
startled
by
a
mocking
voice
which
said
this
fury
is
needless
thou
hast
only
to
wish
for
me
and
i
come
illustration
alvetham
and
john
paslew
it
was
profoundly
dark
i
could
see
nothing
but
a
pair
of
red
orbs
glowing
like
flaming
carbuncles
wouldst
be
free
continued
the
voice
shalt
be
so
arise
and
follow
me
at
this
i
felt
myself
grasped
by
an
iron
arm
against
which
all
resistance
would
have
been
unavailing
even
if
i
had
dared
to
offer
it
and
in
an
instant
i
was
dragged
up
the
narrow
steps
the
stone
wall
opened
before
my
unseen
conductor
and
in
another
moment
we
were
upon
the
roof
of
the
dormitory
by
the
bright
starbeams
shooting
down
from
above
i
discerned
a
tall
shadowy
figure
standing
by
my
side
art
mine
he
cried
in
accents
graven
for
ever
on
my
memory
i
am
a
generous
master
and
will
give
thee
a
long
term
of
freedom
thou
shalt
be
avenged
upon
thine
enemy
deeply
avenged
this
and
i
am
thine
i
replied
a
spirit
of
infernal
vengeance
possessing
me
and
i
knelt
before
the
fiend
thou
must
tarry
for
awhile
he
answered
thine
enemy
time
will
be
long
in
coming
but
it
come
i
can
not
work
him
immediate
harm
but
i
will
lead
him
to
a
height
from
which
he
will
assuredly
fall
headlong
thou
must
depart
from
this
place
for
it
is
perilous
to
thee
and
if
thou
stayest
here
ill
will
befall
thee
i
will
send
a
rat
to
thy
dungeon
which
shall
daily
devour
the
provisions
so
that
the
monks
shall
not
know
thou
hast
fled
in
thirty
and
one
years
shall
the
doom
be
accomplished
two
years
before
that
time
thou
mayst
return
then
come
alone
to
pendle
hill
on
a
friday
night
and
beat
the
water
of
the
moss
pool
on
the
summit
and
i
will
appear
to
thee
and
tell
thee
more
nine
and
twenty
years
remember
with
these
words
the
shadowy
figure
melted
away
and
i
found
myself
standing
alone
on
the
mossy
roof
of
the
dormitory
the
cold
stars
were
shining
down
upon
me
and
i
heard
the
howl
of
the
near
the
gate
the
fair
abbey
slept
in
beauty
around
me
and
i
gnashed
my
teeth
with
rage
to
think
that
you
had
made
me
an
outcast
from
it
and
robbed
me
of
a
dignity
which
might
have
been
mine
i
was
wroth
also
that
my
vengeance
should
be
so
long
delayed
but
i
could
not
remain
where
i
was
so
i
clambered
down
the
buttress
and
fled
away
can
this
be
cried
the
abbot
who
had
listened
in
rapt
wonderment
to
the
narration
two
years
after
your
immurement
in
the
cell
the
food
having
been
for
some
time
untouched
the
wall
was
opened
and
upon
the
pallet
was
found
a
decayed
carcase
in
mouldering
monkish
vestments
it
was
a
body
taken
from
the
charnel
and
placed
there
by
the
demon
replied
the
monk
of
my
long
wanderings
in
other
lands
and
beneath
brighter
skies
i
need
not
tell
you
but
neither
absence
nor
lapse
of
years
cooled
my
desire
of
vengeance
and
when
the
appointed
time
drew
nigh
i
returned
to
my
own
country
and
came
hither
in
a
lowly
garb
under
the
name
of
nicholas
demdike
ha
exclaimed
the
abbot
i
went
to
pendle
hill
as
directed
pursued
the
monk
and
saw
the
dark
shape
there
as
i
beheld
it
on
the
dormitory
roof
all
things
were
then
told
me
and
i
learnt
how
the
late
rebellion
should
rise
and
how
it
should
be
crushed
i
learnt
also
how
my
vengeance
should
be
satisfied
paslew
groaned
aloud
a
brief
pause
ensued
and
deep
emotion
marked
the
accents
of
the
wizard
as
he
proceeded
when
i
came
back
all
this
part
of
lancashire
resounded
with
praises
of
the
beauty
of
bess
blackburn
a
rustic
lass
who
dwelt
in
barrowford
she
was
called
the
flower
of
pendle
and
inflamed
all
the
youths
with
love
and
all
the
maidens
with
jealousy
but
she
favoured
none
except
cuthbert
ashbead
forester
to
the
abbot
of
whalley
her
mother
would
fain
have
given
her
to
the
forester
in
marriage
but
bess
would
not
be
disposed
of
so
easily
i
saw
her
and
became
at
once
enamoured
i
thought
my
heart
was
seared
but
it
was
not
so
the
savage
beauty
of
bess
pleased
me
more
than
the
most
refined
charms
could
have
done
and
her
fierce
character
harmonised
with
my
own
how
i
won
her
matters
not
but
she
cast
off
all
thoughts
of
ashbead
and
clung
to
me
my
wild
life
suited
her
and
she
roamed
the
wastes
with
me
scaled
the
hills
in
my
company
and
shrank
not
from
the
weird
meetings
i
attended
ill
repute
quickly
attended
her
and
she
became
branded
as
a
witch
her
aged
mother
closed
her
doors
upon
her
and
those
who
would
have
gone
miles
to
meet
her
now
avoided
her
bess
heeded
this
little
she
was
of
a
nature
to
repay
the
contumely
with
like
scorn
but
when
her
child
was
born
the
case
became
different
she
wished
to
save
it
then
it
was
pursued
demdike
vehemently
and
regarding
the
abbot
with
flashing
eyes
then
it
was
that
i
was
again
mortally
injured
by
you
then
your
ruthless
decree
to
the
clergy
went
forth
my
child
was
denied
baptism
and
became
subject
to
the
fiend
alas
alas
exclaimed
paslew
and
as
if
this
were
not
injury
enough
thundered
demdike
you
have
called
down
a
withering
and
lasting
curse
upon
its
innocent
head
and
through
it
transfixed
its
mother
heart
if
you
had
complied
with
that
poor
girl
request
i
would
have
forgiven
you
your
wrong
to
me
and
have
saved
you
there
was
a
long
fearful
silence
at
last
demdike
advanced
to
the
abbot
and
seizing
his
arm
fixed
his
eyes
upon
him
as
if
to
search
into
his
soul
answer
me
john
paslew
he
cried
answer
me
as
you
shall
speedily
answer
your
maker
can
that
malediction
be
recalled
dare
not
to
trifle
with
me
or
i
will
tear
forth
your
black
heart
and
cast
it
in
your
face
can
that
curse
be
recalled
speak
it
can
not
replied
the
abbot
half
dead
with
terror
away
then
thundered
demdike
casting
him
from
him
to
the
gallows
to
the
gallows
and
he
rushed
out
of
the
room
chapter
the
abbey
mill
for
a
while
the
abbot
remained
shattered
and
stupefied
by
this
terrible
interview
at
length
he
arose
and
made
his
way
he
scarce
knew
how
to
the
oratory
but
it
was
long
before
the
tumult
of
his
thoughts
could
be
at
all
allayed
and
he
had
only
just
regained
something
like
composure
when
he
was
disturbed
by
hearing
a
slight
sound
in
the
adjoining
chamber
a
mortal
chill
came
over
him
for
he
thought
it
might
be
demdike
returned
presently
he
distinguished
a
footstep
stealthily
approaching
him
and
almost
hoped
that
the
wizard
would
consummate
his
vengeance
by
taking
his
life
but
he
was
quickly
undeceived
for
a
hand
was
placed
on
his
shoulder
and
a
friendly
voice
whispered
in
his
ears
cum

thus
addressed
the
abbot
raised
his
eyes
and

armed

the

and
with
noiseless

he

outside

presently
he
found
himself
upon
the
roof
of
a
building
which
he
knew
to
be
connected
with
the
mill
by
a
covered
passage
running
along
the
south
bank
of
the
calder
scarcely

parapet
overlooking
the
covered
passage

described
half
an
hour
before
it
had
been
bright
moonlight
but
as
if

and
further
aided
by
some
irregularities
in
the
wall
he
was
soon
safely
landed
near

entrance
of

with

he
marched
along
the
passage
followed
by
the
others
and
presently
arrived
at
a
door
against
which
he
tapped
a
bolt
being
withdrawn
it
was
instantly
opened
to
admit
the
party
after
which
it
was
as
quickly
shut
and
secured
in
answer
to
a
call
from
the
miller
a
light
appeared
at
the
top
of
a
steep
flight
of
wooden
steps
and
up
these
paslew
at
the
entreaty
of
abel
mounted
and
found
himself
in
a
large
low
chamber
the
roof
of
which
was
crossed
by
great
beams
covered
thickly
with
cobwebs
whitened
by
flour
while
the
floor
was
strewn
with
empty
sacks
and
sieves
the
person
who
held
the
light
proved
to
be
the
miller
daughter
dorothy
a
blooming
lass
of
eighteen
and
at
the
other
end
of
the
chamber
seated
on
a
bench
before
a
turf
fire
with
an
infant
on
her
knees
was
the
miller
wife
the
latter
instantly
arose
on
beholding
the
abbot
and
placing
the
child
on
a
corn
bin
advanced
towards
him
and
dropped
on
her
knees
while
her
daughter
imitated
her
example
the
abbot
extended
his
hands
over
them
and
pronounced
a
solemn
benediction
bring
your
child
also
to
me
that
i
may
bless
it

said
when
he
concluded
it

the
miller
wife
taking
up
the

the

moved
mechanically
to
the
fire
and
sat
down
while
the
miller
wife
surrendering
the
child
with
a
shrug
of
the
shoulders
and
a
grimace
to
her
daughter
went
in
search
of
some
viands
and
a
flask
of

which
she
set

then
filled
a
and
presented
it
to
his

who
was
about
to
raise
it
to
his
lips
when
a
loud
knocking
was
heard
at
the
door
below
the
knocking
continued
with
increased
violence
and
voices
were
heard
calling
upon
the
miller
to
open
the
door
or
it
would
be
broken
down
on
the
first
alarm
abel

flown
to
a
small
window
whence
he
could
reconnoitre
those
below
and
he
now
returned
with
a
face
white
with
terror
to
say
that
a
party
of
arquebussiers
with
the
sheriff
at
their
head
were
without

that
some
of
the
men
were
provided
with

ye
meantime
the
abbot
had
been
led
to
the
chief
room
of
the
mill
where
all
the
corn
formerly
consumed
within
the
monastery
had
been
prepared
and
which
the
size
of
the
chamber
itself
together
with
the
vastness
of
the
stones
used
in
the
operation
of
grinding
and
connected
with
the
huge
outside
proved
to
be
by
no
means
inconsiderable
strong
shafts
of
timber
supported
the
flooring
above
and
were
crossed
by
other
boards
placed
horizontally
from
which
various
implements
in
use
at
the
mill
depended
giving
the
chamber
imperfectly
lighted
as
it
now
was
by
the
lamp
borne
by
abel
a
strange
and
almost
mysterious
appearance
three
or
four
of
the
miller
men
armed
with
pikes
had
followed
their
master
and
though
much
alarmed
they
vowed
to
die
rather
than
give
up
the
abbot
by
this
time
hal
o
nabs
had
joined
the
group
and
proceeding
towards
a
raised
part
of
the
chamber
where
the
were
set
he
knelt
down
and
laying
hold
of
a
small
ring
raised
up
a
trapdoor
the
fresh
air
which
blew
up
through
the
aperture
combined
with
the
rushing
sound
of
water
showed
that
the
calder
flowed
immediately
beneath
and
having
made
some
slight
preparation
hal
let
himself
down
into
the
stream
at
this
moment
a
loud
crash
was
heard
and
one
of
the
miller
men
cried
out
that
the
arquebussiers
had
burst
open
the
door
be
hondy
then
lads
and
let
him
down
cried
hal
o
nabs
who
had
some
difficulty
in
maintaining
his
footing
on
the
rough
stony
bottom
of
the
swift
stream
passively
yielding
the
abbot
suffered
the
miller
and
one
of
the
stoutest
of
his
men
to
assist
him
through
the
trapdoor
while
a
third
held
down
the
lamp
and
showed
hal
o
nabs
up
to
his
middle
in
the
darkling
current
and
stretching
out
his
arms
to
receive
the
burden
the
light
fell
upon
the
huge
black
circle
of
the
watershed
now
stopped
and
upon
the
dripping
arches
supporting
the
mill
in
another
moment
the
abbot
plunged
into
the
water
the
trapdoor
was
replaced
and
bolted
underneath
by
hal
who
while
guiding
his
companion
along
and
bidding
him
catch
hold
of
the
of
the
wheel
heard
a
heavy
trampling
of
many
feet
on
the
boards
above
showing
that
the
pursuers
had
obtained
admittance
encumbered
by
his
heavy
vestments
the
abbot
could
with
difficulty
contend
against
the
strong
current
and
he
momently
expected
to
be
swept
away
but
he
had
a
stout
and
active
assistant
by
his
side
who
soon
placed
him
under
shelter
of
the
wheel
the
trampling
overhead
continued
for
a
few
minutes
after
which
all
was
quiet
and
hal
judged
that
finding
their
search
within
ineffectual
the
enemy
would
speedily
come
forth
nor
was
he
deceived
shouts
were
soon
heard
at
the
door
of
the
mill
and
the
glare
of
torches
was
cast
on
the
stream
then
it
was
that
hal
dragged
his
companion
into
a
deep
hole
formed
by
some
decay
in
the
masonry
behind
the
wheel
where
the
water
rose
nearly
to
their
chins
and
where
they
were
completely
concealed
scarcely
were
they
thus
ensconced
than
two
or
three
armed
men
holding
torches
aloft
were
seen
wading
under
the
archway
but
after
looking
carefully
around
and
even
approaching
close
to
the
these
persons
could
detect
nothing
and
withdrew
muttering
curses
of
rage
and
disappointment
the
lights
almost
wholly
disappeared
and
the
shouts
becoming
fainter
and
more
distant
it
was
evident
that
the
men
had
gone
lower
down
the
river
upon
this
hal
thought
they
might
venture
to
quit
their
retreat
and
accordingly
grasping
the
abbot
arm
he
proceeded
to
wade
up
the
stream
benumbed
with
cold
and
half
dead
with
terror
paslew
needed
all
his
companion
support
for
he
could
do
little
to
help
himself
added
to
which
they
occasionally
encountered
some
large
stone
or
stepped
into
a
deep
hole
so
that
it
required
hal
utmost
exertion
and
strength
to
force
a
way
on
at
last
they
were
out
of
the
arch
and
though
both
banks
seemed
unguarded
yet
for
fear
of
surprise
hal
deemed
it
prudent
still
to
keep
to
the
river
their
course
was
completely
sheltered
from
observation
by
the
mist
that
enveloped
them
and
after
proceeding
in
this
way
for
some
distance
hal
stopped
to
listen
and
while
debating
with
himself
whether
he
should
now
quit
the
river
he
fancied
he
beheld
a
black
object
swimming
towards
him
taking
it
for
an
otter
with
which
voracious
animal
the
calder
a
stream
swarming
with
trout
abounded
and
knowing
the
creature
would
not
meddle
with
them
unless
first
attacked
he
paid
little
attention
to
it
but
he
was
soon
made
sensible
of
his
error
his
arm
was
suddenly
seized
by
a
large
black
hound
whose
sharp
fangs
met
in
his
flesh
unable
to
repress
a
cry
of
pain
hal
strove
to
disengage
himself
from
his
assailant
and
finding
it
impossible
flung
himself
into
the
water
in
the
hope
of
drowning
him
but
as
the
hound
still
maintained
his
hold
he
searched
for
his
knife
to
slay
him
but
he
could
not
find
it
and
in
his
distress
applied
to
paslew
ha

he
cried
wi
which
ey

paslew
and
i

added
joyfully
found
t
thwittle
go
go
soon
be
efter
ye
feeling
he
should
sink
if
he
remained
where
he
was
and
wholly
unable
to
offer
any
effectual
assistance
to
his
companion
the
abbot
turned
to
the
left
where
a
large
oak
overhung
the
stream
and
he
was
climbing
the
bank
aided
by
the
roots
of
the
tree
when
a
man
suddenly
came
from
behind
it
seized
his
hand
and
dragged
him
up
forcibly
at
the
same
moment
his
captor
placed
a
bugle
to
his
lips
and
winding
a
few
notes
he
was
instantly
answered
by
shouts
and
soon
afterwards
half
a
dozen
armed
men
ran
up
bearing
torches
not
a
word
passed
between
the
fugitive
and
his
captor
but
when
the
men
came
up
and
the
torchlight
fell
upon
the
features
of
the
latter
the
abbot
worst
fears
were
realised
it
was
demdike
false
to
your
king
false
to
your
oath
false
to
all
men
cried
the
wizard
you
seek
to
escape
in
vain
i
merit
all
your
reproaches
replied
the
abbot
but
it
may
he
some
satisfaction
to
you
to
learn
that
i
have
endured
far
greater
suffering
than
if
i
had
patiently
awaited
my
doom
i
am
glad
of
it
rejoined
demdike
with
a
savage
laugh
but
you
have
destroyed
others
beside
yourself
where
is
the
fellow
in
the
water
what
ho
uriel
but
as
no
sound
reached
him
he
snatched
a
torch
from
one
of
the
arquebussiers
and
held
it
to
the
river
brink
but
he
could
see
neither
hound
nor
man
strange
he
cried
he
can
not
have
escaped
uriel
is
more
than
a
match
for
any
man
secure
the
prisoner
while
i
examine
the
stream
with
this
he
ran
along
the
bank
with
great
quickness
holding
his
torch
far
over
the
water
so
as
to
reveal
any
thing
floating
within
it
but
nothing
met
his
view
until
he
came
within
a
short
distance
of
the
mill
when
he
beheld
a
black
object
struggling
in
the
current
and
soon
found
that
it
was
his
dog
making
feeble
efforts
to
gain
the
bank
ah
recreant
thou
hast
let
him
go
cried
demdike
furiously
seeing
his
master
the
animal
redoubled
its
efforts
crept
ashore
and
fell
at
his
feet
with
a
last
effort
to
lick
his
hands
demdike
held
down
the
torch
and
then
perceived
that
the
hound
was
quite
dead
there
was
a
deep
gash
in
its
side
and
another
in
the
throat
showing
how
it
had
perished
poor
uriel
he
exclaimed
the
only
true
friend
i
had
and
thou
art
gone
the
villain
has
killed
thee
but
he
shall
pay
for
it
with
his
life
and
hurrying
back
he
dispatched
four
of
the
men
in
quest
of
the
fugitive
while
accompanied
by
the
two
others
he
conveyed
paslew
back
to
the
abbey
where
he
was
placed
in
a
strong
cell
from
which
there
was
no
possibility
of
escape
and
a
guard
set
over
him
half
an
hour
after
this
two
of
the
arquebussiers
returned
with
hal
nabs
whom
they
had
succeeded
in
capturing
after
a
desperate
resistance
about
a
mile
from
the
abbey
on
the
road
to
wiswall
he
was
taken
to
the
which
had
been
appointed
in
one
of
the
lower
chambers
of
the
and
demdike
was
immediately
apprised
of
his
arrival
satisfied
by
an
inspection
of
the
prisoner
whose
demeanour
was
sullen
and
resolved
demdike
proceeded
to
the
great
hall
where
the
earl
of
derby
who
had
returned
thither
after
the
midnight
mass
was
still
sitting
with
his
retainers
an
audience
was
readily
obtained
by
the
wizard
and
apparently
well
pleased
with
the
result
he
returned
to
the
the
prisoner
was
seated
by
himself
in
one
corner
of
the
chamber
with
his
hands
tied
behind
his
back
with
a
leathern
thong
and
demdike
approaching
him
told
him
that

aided
the
escape
of

condemned
rebel
and
traitor
and
violently
assaulting

swiftness
at

demdike
sought
the

and
as

drew
near
it
there
issued
from

a
female
who
hastily
placing

wrapped
in

in

tarried
for
no

but
instantly

demdike

chapter
the
executioner
dawn
came
at
last
after
a
long
and
weary
night
to
many
within
and
without
the
abbey
every
thing
betokened
a
dismal
day
the
atmosphere
was
damp
and
oppressive
to
the
spirits
while
the
raw
cold
sensibly
affected
the
frame
all
astir
were
filled
with
gloom
and
despondency
and
secretly
breathed
a
wish
that
the
tragical
business
of
the
day
were
ended
the
vast
range
of
pendle
was
obscured
by
clouds
and
ere
long
the
vapours
descended
into
the
valleys
and
rain
began
to
fall
at
first
slightly
but
afterwards
in
heavy
continuous
showers
melancholy
was
the
aspect
of
the
abbey
and
it
required
no
stretch
of
imagination
to
fancy
that
the
old
structure
was
deploring
the
fate
of
its
former
ruler
to
those
impressed
with
the
idea
and
many
there
were
who
were
so
the
very
stones
of
the
convent
church
seemed
dissolving
into
tears
the
statues
of
the
saints
appeared
to
weep
and
the
great
statue
of
saint
gregory
de
northbury
over
the
porch
seemed
bowed
down
with
grief
the
grotesquely
carved
heads
on
the
spouts
grinned
horribly
at
the
abbot
destroyers
and
spouted
forth
cascades
of
water
as
if
with
the
intent
of
drowning
them
so
deluging
and
incessant
were
the
showers
that
it
seemed
indeed
as
if
the
abbey
would
be
flooded
all
the
inequalities
of
ground
within
the
great
quadrangle
of
the
cloisters
looked
like
ponds
and
the
various
from
the
dormitory
the
refectory
and
the
continuing
to
jet
forth
streams
into
the
court
below
the
ambulatories
were
soon
filled
and
even
the
lower
apartments
on
which
they
opened
invaded
surcharged
with
moisture
the
royal
banner
on
the
gate
drooped
and
clung
to
the
staff
as
if
it
too
shared
in
the
general
depression
or
as
if
the
sovereign
authority
it
represented
had
given
way
the
countenances
and
deportment
of
the
men
harmonized
with
the
weather
they
moved
about
gloomily
and
despondently
their
bright
accoutrements
sullied
with
the
wet
and
their
buskins
clogged
with
mire
a
forlorn
sight
it
was
to
watch
the
shivering
sentinels
on
the
walls
and
yet
more
forlorn
to
see
the
groups
of
the
abbot
old
retainers
gathering
without
wrapped
in
their
blue
woollen
cloaks
patiently
enduring
the
drenching
showers
and
awaiting
the
last
awful
scene
but
the
saddest
sight
of
all
was
on
the
hill
already
described
called
the
holehouses
here
two
other
lesser
gibbets
had
been
erected
during
the
night
one
on
either
hand
of
the
loftier
instrument
of
justice
and
the
carpenters
were
yet
employed
in
finishing
their
work
having
been
delayed
by
the
badness
of
the
weather
half
drowned
by
the
torrents
that
fell
upon
them
the
poor
fellows
were
protected
from
interference
with
their
disagreeable
occupation
by
half
a
dozen
and
troopers
and
by
as
many
halberdiers
and
this
company
completely
exposed
to
the
weather
suffered
severely
from
wet
and
cold
the
rain
beat
against
the
gallows
ran
down
its
tall
naked
posts
and
collected
in
pools
at
its
feet
attracted
by
some
strange
instinct
which
seemed
to
give
them
a
knowledge
of
the
object
of
these
terrible
preparations
two
ravens
wheeled
screaming
round
the
fatal
tree
and
at
length
one
of
them
settled
on
the
and
could
with
difficulty
be
dislodged
by
the
shouts
of
the
men
when
it
flew
away
croaking
hoarsely
up
this
gentle
hill
ordinarily
so
soft
and
beautiful
but
now
abhorrent
as
a
golgotha
in
the
eyes
of
the
beholders
groups
of
rustics
and
monks
had
climbed
over
ground
rendered
slippery
with
moisture
and
had
gathered
round
the
paling
encircling
the
terrible
apparatus
looking
the
images
of
despair
and
woe
even
those
within
the
abbey
and
sheltered
from
the
storm
shared
the
despondency
the
refectory
looked
dull
and
comfortless
and
the
logs
on
the
hearth
hissed
and
sputtered
and
would
not
burn
green
wood
had
been
brought
instead
of
dry
fuel
by
the
drowsy
henchman
the
viands
on
the
board
provoked
not
the
appetite
and
the
men
emptied
their
cups
of
ale
yawned
and
stretched
their
arms
as
if
they
would
fain
sleep
an
hour
or
two
longer
the
sense
of
discomfort
was
heightened
by
the
entrance
of
those
whose
term
of
watch
had
been
relieved
and
who
cast
their
dripping
cloaks
on
the
floor
while
two
or
three
savage
dogs
steaming
with
moisture
stretched
their
huge
lengths
before
the
sullen
fire
and
disputed
all
approach
to
it
within
the
great
hall
were
already
gathered
the
retainers
of
the
earl
of
derby
but
the
nobleman
himself
had
not
appeared
having
passed
the
greater
part
of
the
night
in
conference
with
one
person
or
another
and
the
abbot
flight
having
caused
him
much
disquietude
though
he
did
not
hear
of
it
till
the
fugitive
was
recovered
the
earl
would
not
seek
his
couch
until
within
an
hour
of
daybreak
and
his
attendants
considering
the
state
of
the
weather
and
that
it
yet
wanted
full
two
hours
to
the
time
appointed
for
the
execution
did
not
think
it
needful
to
disturb
him
braddyll
and
assheton
however
were
up
and
ready
but
despite
their
firmness
of
nerve
they
yielded
like
the
rest
to
the
depressing
influence
of
the
weather
and
began
to
have
some
misgivings
as
to
their
own
share
in
the
tragedy
about
to
be
enacted
the
various
gentlemen
in
attendance
paced
to
and
fro
within
the
hall
holding
but
slight
converse
together
anxiously
counting
the
minutes
for
the
time
appeared
to
pass
on
with
unwonted
slowness
and
ever
and
anon
glancing
through
the
diamond
panes
of
the
window
at
the
rain
pouring
down
steadily
without
and
coming
back
again
hopeless
of
amendment
in
the
weather
if
such
were
the
disheartening
influence
of
the
day
on
those
who
had
nothing
to
apprehend
what
must
its
effect
have
been
on
the
poor
captives
woful
indeed
the
two
monks
suffered
a
complete
prostration
of
spirit
all
the
resolution
which
father
haydocke
had
displayed
in
his
interview
with
the
earl
of
derby
failed
him
now
and
he
yielded
to
the
agonies
of
despair
father
eastgate
was
in
little
better
condition
and
gave
vent
to
unavailing
lamentations
instead
of
paying
heed
to
the
consolatory
discourse
of
the
monk
who
had
been
permitted
to
visit
him
the
abbot
was
better
sustained
though
greatly
enfeebled
by
the
occurrences
of
the
night
yet
in
proportion
as
his
bodily
strength
decreased
his
mental
energies
rallied
since
the
confession
of
his
secret
offence
and
the
conviction
he
had
obtained
that
his
supposed
victim
still
lived
a
weight
seemed
taken
from
his
breast
and
he
had
no
longer
any
dread
of
death
rather
he
looked
to
the
speedy
termination
of
existence
with
hopeful
pleasure
he
prepared
himself
as
decently
as
the
means
afforded
him
permitted
for
his
last
appearance
before
the
world
but
refused
all
refreshment
except
a
cup
of
water
and
being
left
to
himself
was
praying
fervently
when
a
man
was
admitted
into
his
cell
thinking
it
might
be
the
executioner
come
to
summon
him
he
arose
and
to
his
surprise
beheld
hal
o
nabs
the
countenance
of
the
rustic
was
pale
but
his
bearing
was
determined

paslew
would
have
sought
some
further
explanation
but
hal
stepped
quickly
backwards
and
striking
his
foot
against
the
door
it
was
instantly
opened
by
the
guard
and
he
went
forth
not
long
after
this
the
earl
of
derby
entered
the
great
hall
and
his
first
inquiry
was
as
to
the
safety
of
the
prisoners
when
satisfied
of
this
he
looked
forth
and
shuddered
at
the
dismal
state
of
the
weather
while
he
was
addressing
some
remarks
on
this
subject
and
on
its
interference
with
the
tragical
exhibition
about
to
take
place
an
officer
entered
the
hall
followed
by
several
persons
of
inferior
condition
amongst
whom
was
hal
o
nabs
and
marched
up
to
the
earl
while
the
others
remained
standing
at
a
respectful
distance
what
news
do
you
bring
me
sir
cried
the
earl
noticing
the
evident
uneasiness
of
manner
nothing

happened
to
the
prisoners
god
death

it

you
shall
all

my

said
the
officer
but
but
what
interrupted
the
earl
out
with
it
quickly
the
executioner
from
lancaster
and
his
two
aids
have
fled
replied
the
officer
fled
exclaimed
the
earl
stamping
his
foot
with
rage
now
as
i
live
this
is
a
device
to
delay
the
execution
till
some
new
attempt
at
rescue
can
be
made
but
it
shall
fail
if
i
string
up
the
abbot
myself
death
can
no
other
hangmen
be
found
ha
of
a
surety
my
lord
but
all
have
an
aversion
to
the
office
and
hold
it
opprobrious
especially
to
put
churchmen
to
death
replied
the
officer
opprobrious
or
not
it
must
be
done
replied
the
earl
see
that
fitting
persons
are
provided
at
this
moment
hal

stepped

ey
willing

my

abbut
without

or
rewort
he
said
thou
him
a
grudge
i
suppose
good
fellow
replied
the
earl
laughing
at
the
rustic
uncouth
appearance
but
thou
a
stout
fellow
and
one
not
likely
to
flinch
and
may
discharge
the
office
as
well
as
another
if
no
better
man
can
be
found
let
him
do
it
he
added
to
the
officer
ey
humbly
thonk
your
lortship
replied
hal
inwardly
rejoicing
at
the
success
of
his
scheme
but
his
countenance
fell
when
he
perceived
demdike
advance
from
behind
the
others
this
man
is
not
to
be
trusted
my
lord
said
demdike
coming
forward
he
has
some
mischievous
design
in
making
the
request
so
far
from
bearing
enmity
to
the
abbot
it
was
he
who
assisted
him
in
his
attempt
to
escape
last
night
what
exclaimed
the
earl
is
this
a
new
trick
bring
the
fellow
forward
that
i
may
examine
him
but
hal
was
gone
instantly
divining
demdike
purpose
and
seeing
his
chance
lost
he
mingled
with
the
who
covered
his
retreat
nor
could
he
be
found
when
sought
for
by
the
guard
see
you
provide
a
substitute
quickly
sir
cried
the
earl
angrily
to
the
officer
it
is
needless
to
take
further
trouble
my
lord
replied
demdike
i
am
come
to
offer
myself
as
executioner
thou
exclaimed
the
earl
ay
replied
the
other
when
i
heard
that
the
men
from
lancaster
were
fled
i
instantly
knew
that
some
scheme
to
frustrate
the
ends
of
justice
was
on
foot
and
i
at
once
resolved
to
undertake
the
office
myself
rather
than
delay
or
risk
should
occur
what
this
man
aim
was
who
hath
just
offered
himself
i
partly
guess
but
it
hath
failed
and
if
your
lordship
will
intrust
the
matter
to
me
i
will
answer
that
no
further
impediment
shall
arise
but
that
the
sentence
shall
be
fully
carried
out
and
the
law
satisfied
your
lordship
can
trust
me
i
know
it
replied
the
earl
be
it
as
you
will
it
is
now
on
the
stroke
of
nine
at
ten
let
all
be
in
readiness
to
set
out
for
wiswall
hall
the
rain
may
have
ceased
by
that
time
but
no
weather
must
stay
you
go
forth
with
the
new
executioner
sir
he
added
to
the
officer
and
see
all
necessary
preparations
made
and
as
demdike
bowed
and
departed
with
the
officer
the
earl
sat
down
with
his
retainers
to
break
his
fast
chapter
wiswall
hall
shortly
before
ten
a
numerous
cortège
consisting
of
a
troop
of
horse
in
their
full
equipments
a
band
of
archers
with
their
bows
over
their
shoulders
and
a
long
train
of
barefoot
monks
who
had
been
permitted
to
attend
set
out
from
the
abbey
behind
them
came
a
varlet
with
a
paper
mitre
on
his
head
and
a
lathen
crosier
in
his
hand
covered
with
a
surcoat
on
which
was
emblazoned
but
torn
and
reversed
the
arms
of
paslew
argent
a
fess
between
three
mullets
sable
pierced
of
the
field
a
crescent
for
difference
after
him
came
another
varlet
bearing
a
banner
on
which
was
painted
a
grotesque
figure
in
a
garb
representing
the
earl
of
poverty
with
this
distich
beneath
it
priest
and
warrior
rich
and
poor
he
shall
be
hanged
at
his
own
door
next
followed
a
tumbrel
drawn
by
two
horses
in
which
sat
the
abbot
alone
the
two
other
prisoners
being
kept
back
for
the
present
then
came
demdike
in
a
leathern
jerkin
and
hose
fitting
closely
to
his
sinewy
limbs
and
wrapped
in
a
houppeland
of
the
same
colour
as
the
hose
with
a
coil
of
rope
round
his
neck
he
walked
between
two
personages
habited
in
black
whom
he
had
chosen
as
assistants
a
band
of
halberdiers
brought
up
the
rear
the
procession
moved
slowly
along
the
tolling
each
minute
and
a
muffled
drum
sounding
hollowly
at
intervals
shortly
before
the
procession
started
the
rain
ceased
but
the
air
felt
damp
and
chill
and
the
roads
were
inundated
passing
out
at
the
gateway
the
gloomy
train
skirted
the
south
side
of
the
convent
church
and
went
on
in
the
direction
of
the
village
of
whalley
when
near
the
east
end
of
the
holy
edifice
the
abbot
beheld
two
coffins
borne
along
and
on
inquiry
learnt
that
they
contained
the
bodies
of
bess
demdike
and
cuthbert
ashbead
who
were
about
to
be
interred
in
the
cemetery
at
this
moment
his
eye
for
the
first
time
encountered
that
of
his
implacable
foe
and
he
then
discovered
that
he
was
to
serve
as
his
executioner
at
first
paslew
felt
much
trouble
at
this
thought
but
the
feeling
quickly
passed
away
on
reaching
whalley
every
door
was
found
closed
and
every
window
shut
so
that
the
spectacle
was
lost
upon
the
inhabitants
and
after
a
brief
halt
the
cavalcade
get
out
for
wiswall
hall
sprung
from
an
ancient
family
residing
in
the
neighbourhood
of
whalley
abbot
paslew
was
the
second
son
of
francis
paslew
of
wiswall

a
great
gloomy
stone
mansion
situated
at
the
foot
of
the
side
of
pendle
hill
where
his
brother
francis
still
resided
of
a
cold
and
cautious
character
francis
paslew
second
of
the
name
held
aloof
from
the
insurrection
and
when
his
brother
was
arrested
he
wholly
abandoned
him
still
the
owner
of
wiswall
had
not
altogether
escaped
suspicion
and
it
was
probably
as
much
with
the
view
of
degrading
him
as
of
adding
to
the
abbot
punishment
that
the
latter
was
taken
to
the
hall
on
the
morning
of
his
execution
be
this
as
it
may
the
cortège
toiled
thither
through
roads
bad
in
the
best
of
seasons
but
now
since
the
heavy
rain
scarcely
passable
and
it
arrived
there
in
about
half
an
hour
and
drew
up
on
the
broad
green
lawn
window
and
door
of
the
hall
were
closed
no
smoke
issued
from
the
heavy
pile
of
chimneys
and
to
all
outward
seeming
the
place
was
utterly
deserted
in
answer
to
inquiries
it
appeared
that
francis
paslew
had
departed
for
northumberland
on
the
previous
day
taking
all
his
household
with
him
in
earlier
years
a
quarrel
having
occurred
between
the
haughty
abbot
and
the
churlish
francis
the
brothers
rarely
met
whence
it
chanced
that
john
paslew
had
seldom
visited
the
place
of
his
birth
of
late
though
lying
so
near
to
the
abbey
and
indeed
forming
part
of
its
ancient
dependencies
it
was
sad
to
view
it
now
and
yet
the
house
gloomy
as
it
was
recalled
seasons
with
which
though
they
might
awaken
regret
no
guilty
associations
were
connected
dark
was
the
hall
and
desolate
but
on
the
fine
old
trees
around
it
the
rooks
were
settling
and
their
loud
cawings
pleased
him
and
excited
gentle
emotions
for
a
few
moments
he
grew
young
again
and
forgot
why
he
was
there
fondly
surveying
the
house
the
terraced
garden
in
which
as
a
boy
he
had
so
often
strayed
and
the
park
beyond
it
where
he
had
chased
the
deer
his
gaze
rose
to
the
cloudy
heights
of
pendle
springing
immediately
behind
the
mansion
and
up
which
he
had
frequently
climbed
the
of
memory
were
opened
at
once
and
a
whole
tide
of
feelings
rushed
upon
his
heart
from
this
retrospect
he
was
aroused
by
the
loud
blast
of
a
trumpet
thrice
blown
a
recapitulation
of
his
offences
together
with
his
sentence
was
read
by
a
herald
after
which
the
reversed
blazonry
was
fastened
upon
the
door
of
the
hall
just
below
a
stone
escutcheon
on
which
was
carved
the
arms
of
the
family
while
the
paper
mitre
was
torn
and
trampled
under
foot
the
lathen
crosier
broken
in
twain
and
the
scurril
banner
hacked
in
pieces
while
this
degrading
act
was
performed
a
man
in
a
miller
white
garb
with
the
hood
drawn
over
his
face
forced
his
way
towards
the
tumbrel
and
while
the
attention
of
the
guard
was
otherwise
engaged
whispered
in
paslew
ear

replied
paslew
who
recognised
the
voice
of

and
hoped
by
this
assertion
to
divert
him
from
his
purpose
ha

cried
hal
then
reach
him
summot
sacred
and
he
disappeared
at
this
moment
word
was
given
to
return
and
in
half
an
hour
the
cavalcade
arrived
at
the
abbey
in
the
same
order
it
had
left
it
though
the
rain
had
ceased
heavy
clouds
still
hung
overhead
threatening
another
deluge
and
the
aspect
of
the
abbey
remained
gloomy
as
ever
the
bell
continued
to
toll
drums
were
beaten
and
trumpets
sounded
from
the
outer
and
inner
gateway
and
from
the
three
quadrangles
the
cavalcade
drew
up
in
front
of
the
great
northern
entrance
and
its
return
being
announced
within
the
two
other
captives
were
brought
forth
each
fastened
upon
a
hurdle
harnessed
to
a
stout
horse
they
looked
dead
already
so
ghastly
was
the
hue
of
their
cheeks
the
abbot
turn
came
next
another
hurdle
was
brought
forward
and
demdike
advanced
to
the
tumbrel
but
paslew
recoiled
from
his
touch
and
sprang
to
the
ground
unaided
he
was
then
laid
on
his
back
upon
the
hurdle
and
his
hands
and
feet
were
bound
fast
with
ropes
to
the
twisted
timbers
while
this
painful
task
was
roughly
performed
by
the
two
assistants
the
crowd
of
rustics
who
looked
on
murmured
and
exhibited
such
strong
tokens
of
displeasure
that
the
guard
thought
it
prudent
to
keep
them
off
with
their
halberts
but
when
all
was
done
demdike
motioned
to
a
man
standing
behind
him
to
advance
and
the
person
who
was
wrapped
in
a
russet
cloak
complied
drew
forth
an
infant
and
held
it
in
such
way
that
the
abbot
could
see
it
paslew
understood
what
was
meant
but
he
uttered
not
a
word
demdike
then
knelt
down
beside
him
as
if
ascertaining
the
security
of
the
cords
and
whispered
in
his
ear
recall
thy
malediction
and
my
dagger
shall
save
thee
from
the
last
indignity
never
replied
paslew
the
curse
is
irrevocable
but
i
would
not
recall
it
if
i
could
as
i
have
said
thy
child
shall
be
a
witch
and
the
mother
of
witches
but
all
shall
be
swept
off
all
hell
torments
seize
thee
cried
the
wizard
furiously
nay
thou
hast
done
thy
worst
to
me
rejoined
paslew
meekly
thou
canst
not
harm
me
beyond
the
grave
look
to
thyself
for
even
as
thou
speakest
thy
child
is
taken
from
thee
and
so
it
was
while
demdike
knelt
beside
paslew
a
hand
was
put
forth
and
before
the
man
who
had
custody
of
the
infant
could
prevent
it
his
little
charge
was
snatched
from
him
thus
the
abbot
saw
though
the
wizard
perceived
it
not
the
latter
instantly
sprang
to
his
feet
where
is
the
child
he
demanded
of
the
fellow
in
the
russet
cloak
it
was
taken
from
me
by
yon
tall
man
who
is
disappearing
through
the
gateway
replied
the
other
in
great
trepidation
ha
here
exclaimed
demdike
regarding
the
dark
figure
with
a
look
of
despair
it
is
gone
from
me
for
ever
ay
for
ever
echoed
the
abbot
solemnly
but
revenge
is
still
left
me
revenge
cried
demdike
with
an
infuriated
gesture
then
glut
thyself
with
it
speedily
replied
the
abbot
for
thy
time
here
is
short
i
care
not
if
it
be
replied
demdike
i
shall
live
long
enough
if
i
survive
thee
chapter
the
holehouses
at
this
moment
the
blast
of
a
trumpet
resounded
from
the
gateway
and
the
earl
of
derby
with
the
sheriff
on
his
right
hand
and
assheton
on
the
left
and
mounted
on
a
richly
caparisoned
charger
rode
forth
he
was
preceded
by
four
and
followed
by
two
heralds
in
their
tabards
to
doleful
tolling
of
bells
to
solemn
music
to
plaintive
hymn
chanted
by
monks
to
roll
of
muffled
drum
at
intervals
the
sad
cortège
set
forth
loud
cries
from
the
bystanders
marked
its
departure
and
some
of
them
followed
it
but
many
turned
away
unable
to
endure
the
sight
of
horror
about
to
ensue
amongst
those
who
went
on
was
hal
o
nabs
but
he
took
care
to
keep
out
of
the
way
of
the
guard
though
he
was
little
likely
to
be
recognised
owing
to
his
disguise
despite
the
miserable
state
of
the
weather
a
great
multitude
was
assembled
at
the
place
of
execution
and
they
watched
the
approaching
cavalcade
with
moody
curiosity
to
prevent
disturbance
arquebussiers
were
stationed
in
parties
here
and
there
and
a
clear
course
for
the
cortège
was
preserved
by
two
lines
of
halberdiers
with
crossed
pikes
but
notwithstanding
this
much
difficulty
was
experienced
in
mounting
the
hill
rendered
slippery
by
the
wet
and
yet
more
so
by
the
trampling
of
the
crowd
the
road
was
so
bad
in
places
that
the
horses
could
scarcely
drag
the
hurdles
up
it
and
more
than
one
delay
occurred
the
stoppages
were
always
denounced
by
groans
yells
and
hootings
from
the
mob
and
these
neither
the
menaces
of
the
earl
of
derby
nor
the
active
measures
of
the
guard
could
repress
at
length
however
the
cavalcade
reached
its
destination
then
the
crowd
struggled
forward
and
settled
into
a
dense
compact
ring
round
the
circular
railing
enclosing
the
place
of
execution
within
which
were
drawn
up
the
earl
of
derby
the
sheriff
assheton
and
the
principal
gentlemen
together
with
demdike
and
his
assistants
the
guard
forming
a
circle
three
deep
round
them
paslew
was
first
unloosed
and
when
he
stood
up
he
found
father
smith
the
late
prior
beside
him
and
tenderly
embraced
him
be
of
good
courage
father
abbot
said
the
prior
a
few
moments
and
you
will
be
numbered
with
the
just
my
hope
is
in
the
infinite
mercy
of
heaven
father
replied
paslew
sighing
deeply
pray
for
me
at
the
last
doubt
it
not
returned
the
prior
fervently
i
will
pray
for
you
now
and
ever
meanwhile
the
bonds
of
the
two
other
captives
were
unfastened
but
they
were
found
wholly
unable
to
stand
without
support
a
lofty
ladder
had
been
placed
against
the
central
scaffold
and
up
this
demdike
having
cast
off
his
houppeland
mounted
and
adjusted
the
rope
his
tall
gaunt
figure
fully
displayed
in
his
red
garb
made
him
look
like
a
hideous
scarecrow
his
appearance
was
greeted
by
the
mob
with
a
perfect
hurricane
of
indignant
outcries
and
yells
but
he
heeded
them
not
but
calmly
pursued
his
task
above
him
wheeled
the
two
ravens
who
had
never
quitted
the
place
since
daybreak
uttering
their
discordant
cries
when
all
was
done
he
descended
a
few
steps
and
taking
a
black
hood
from
his
girdle
to
place
over
the
head
of
his
victim
called
out
in
a
voice
which
had
little
human
in
its
tone
i
wait
for
you
john
paslew
are
you
ready
paslew
demanded
the
earl
of
derby
i
am
my
lord
replied
the
abbot
and
embracing
the
prior
for
the
last
time
he
added
carissime
frater
in
æternum
vale
et
dominus
tecum
sit
in
ultionem
inimicorum
it
is
the
king
pleasure
that
you
say
not
a
word
in
your
justification
to
the
mob
paslew
observed
the
earl
i
had
no
such
intention
my
lord
replied
the
abbot
then
tarry
no
longer
said
the
earl
if
you
need
aid
you
shall
have
it
i
require
none
replied
paslew
resolutely
with
this
he
mounted
the
ladder
with
as
much
firmness
and
dignity
as
if
ascending
the
steps
of
a
tribune
hitherto
nothing
but
yells
and
angry
outcries
had
stunned
the
ears
of
the
and
several
missiles
had
been
hurled
at
demdike
some
of
which
took
effect
though
without
occasioning
discomfiture
but
when
the
abbot
appeared
above
the
heads
of
the
guard
the
tumult
instantly
subsided
and
profound
silence
ensued
not
a
breath
was
drawn
by
the
spectators
the
ravens
alone
continued
their
ominous
croaking
hal
o
nabs
who
stood
on
the
outskirts
of
the
ring
saw
thus
far
but
he
could
bear
it
no
longer
and
rushed
down
the
hill
just
as
he
reached
the
level
ground
a
culverin
was
fired
from
the
gateway
and
the
next
moment
a
loud
wailing
cry
bursting
from
the
mob
told
that
the
abbot
was
launched
into
eternity
hal
would
not
look
back
but
went
slowly
on
and
presently
afterwards
other
horrid
sounds
dinned
in
his
ears
telling
that
all
was
over
with
the
two
other
sufferers
sickened
and
faint
he
leaned
against
a
wall
for
support
how
long
he
continued
thus
he
knew
not
but
he
heard
the
cavalcade
coming
down
the
hill
and
saw
the
earl
of
derby
and
his
attendants
ride
past
glancing
toward
the
place
of
execution
hal
then
perceived
that
the
abbot
had
been
cut
down
and
rousing
himself
he
joined
the
crowd
now
rushing
towards
the
gate
and
ascertained
that
the
body
of
paslew
was
to
be
taken
to
the
convent
church
and
deposited
there
till
orders
were
to
be
given
respecting
its
interment
he
learnt
also
that
the
removal
of
the
corpse
was
intrusted
to
demdike
fired
by
this
intelligence
and
suddenly
conceiving
a
wild
project
of
vengeance
founded
upon
what
he
had
heard
from
the
abbot
of
the
wizard
being
proof
against
weapons
forged
by
men
he
hurried
to
the
church
entered
it
the
door
being
thrown
open
and
rushing
up
to
the
gallery
contrived
to
get
out
through
a
window
upon
the
top
of
the
porch
where
he
secreted
himself
behind
the
great
stone
statue
of
saint
gregory
the
information
he
had
obtained
proved
correct
ere
long
a
mournful
train
approached
the
church
and
a
bier
was
set
down
before
the
porch
a
black
hood
covered
the
face
of
the
dead
but
the
vestments
showed
that
it
was
the
body
of
paslew
at
the
head
of
the
bearers
was
demdike
and
when
the
body
was
set
down
he
advanced
towards
it
and
removing
the
hood
gazed
at
the
livid
and
distorted
features
at
length
i
am
fully
avenged
he
said
and
abbot
paslew
also
cried
a
voice
above
him
demdike
looked
up
but
the
look
was
his
last
for
the
ponderous
statue
of
saint
gregory
de
northbury
launched
from
its
pedestal
fell
upon
his
head
and
crushed
him
to
the
ground
a
mangled
and
breathless
mass
was
taken
from
beneath
the
image
and
the
hands
and
visage
of
paslew
were
found
spotted
with
blood
dashed
from
the
gory
carcass
the
author
of
the
wizard
destruction
was
suspected
but
never
found
nor
was
it
positively
known
who
had
done
the
deed
till
years
after
when
hal
nabs
who
meanwhile
had
married
pretty
dorothy
croft
and
had
been
blessed
by
numerous
offspring
in
the
union
made
his
last
confession
and
then
he
exhibited
no
remarkable
or
becoming
penitence
for
the
act
neither
was
he
refused
absolution
thus
it
came
to
pass
that
the
abbot
and
his
enemy
perished
together
the
mutilated
remains
of
the
wizard
were
placed
in
a
shell
and
huddled
into
the
grave
where
his
wife
had
that
morning
been
laid
but
no
prayer
was
said
over
him
and
the
superstitious
believed
that
the
body
was
carried
off
that
very
night
by
the
fiend
and
taken
to
a
witch
sabbath
in
the
ruined
tower
on
rimington
moor
certain
it
was
that
the
unhallowed
grave
was
disturbed
the
body
of
paslew
was
decently
interred
in
the
north
aisle
of
the
parish
church
of
whalley
beneath
a
stone
with
a
gothic
cross
sculptured
upon
it
and
bearing
the
piteous
inscription
but
in
the
belief
of
the
vulgar
the
abbot
did
not
rest
tranquilly
for
many
years
afterwards
a
monastic
figure
was
seen
to
flit
along
the
cloisters
pass
out
at
the
gate
and
disappear
with
a
wailing
cry
over
the
holehouses
and
the
same
ghostly
figure
was
often
seen
to
glide
through
the
corridor
in
the
abbot
lodging
and
vanish
at
the
door
of
the
chamber
leading
to
the
little
oratory
thus
whalley
abbey
was
supposed
to
be
haunted
and
few
liked
to
wander
through
its
deserted
cloisters
or
ruined
church
after

folk
resorted
and
indeed
many
of
the
gentry
as
well
for
in
the
good
old
times
when
england
was
still
merry
england
a
wake
had
attractions
for
all
classes
alike
and
especially
in
lancashire
for
with
pride
i
speak
it
there
were
no
lads
who
in
running
vaulting
wrestling
dancing
or
in
any
other
manly
exercise
could
compare
with
the
lancashire
lads
in
archery
above
all
none
could
match
them
for
were
not
their
ancestors
the
stout
bowmen
and
billmen
whose
shafts
and
trenchant
weapons
won
the
day
at
flodden
and
were
they
not
true
sons
of
their
fathers
and
then
i
speak
it
with
yet
greater
pride
there
were
few
if
any
lasses
who
could
compare
in
comeliness
with
the
lasses
of
lancashire
assemblages
of
this
kind
therefore
where
the
best
specimens
of
either
sex
were
to
be
met
with
were
sure
to
be
well
attended
and
in
spite
of
an
enactment
passed
in
the
preceding
reign
of
elizabeth
prohibiting
piping
playing
and
on
the
or
on
any
other
days
and
also
superstitious
ringing
of
bells
wakes
and
common
feasts
they
were
not
only
not
interfered
with
but
rather
encouraged
by
the
higher
orders
indeed
it
was
well
known
that
the
reigning
monarch
james
the
first
inclined
the
other
way
and
desirous
of
checking
the
growing
spirit
of
puritanism
throughout
the
kingdom
had
openly
expressed
himself
in
favour
of
honest
recreation
after
evening
prayers
and
upon
holidays
and
furthermore
had
declared
that
he
liked
well
the
spirit
of
his
good
subjects
in
lancashire
and
would
not
see
them
punished
for
indulging
in
lawful
exercises
but
that
ere
long
he
would
pay
them
a
visit
in
one
of
his
progresses
and
judge
for
himself
and
if
he
found
all
things
as
they
had
been
represented
to
him
he
would
grant
them
still
further
licence
meanwhile
this
expression
of
the
royal
opinion
removed
every
restriction
and
old
sports
and
pastimes
and
with
wakes
and
feasts
were
as
much
practised
as
before
the
passing
of
the
obnoxious
enactment
of
elizabeth
the
puritans
and
precisians
discountenanced
them
it
is
true
as
much
as
ever
and
would
have
put
them
down
if
they
could
as
savouring
of
papistry
and
idolatry
and
some
rigid
divines
thundered
against
them
from
the
pulpit
but
with
the
king
and
the
authorities
in
their
favour
the
people
little
heeded
these
denunciations
against
them
and
abstained
not
from
any
honest
recreation
whenever
a
holiday
occurred
if
lancashire
was
famous
for
wakes
the
wakes
of
whalley
were
famous
even
in
lancashire
the
men
of
the
district
were
in
general
a
hardy
handsome
race
of
the
genuine
saxon
breed
and
passionately
fond
of
all
kinds
of
pastime
and
the
women
had
their
full
share
of
the
beauty
indigenous
to
the
soil
besides
it
was
a
secluded
spot
in
the
heart
of
a
wild
mountainous
region
and
though
occasionally
visited
by
travellers
journeying
northward
or
by
others
coming
from
the
opposite
direction
retained
a
primitive
simplicity
of
manners
and
a
great
partiality
for
old
customs
and
habits
the
natural
beauties
of
the
place
contrasted
with
the
dreary
region
around
it
and
heightened
by
the
picturesque
ruins
of
the
ancient
abbey
part
of
which
namely
the
old
abbot
lodgings
had
been
converted
into
a
residence
by
the
asshetons
and
was
now
occupied
by
sir
ralph
assheton
while
the
other
was
left
to
the
ravages
of
time
made
it
always
an
object
of
attraction
to
those
residing
near
it
but
when
on
the
in
question
there
was
not
only
to
be
a
wake
but
a
set
on
the
green
and
a
with
besides
together
with
at
the
abbey
crowds
flocked
to
whalley
from
wiswall
cold
coates
and
clithero
from
ribchester
and
blackburn
from
padiham
and
pendle
and
even
from
places
more
remote
not
only
was
john
lawe
of
the
dragon
full
but
the
chequers
and
the
swan
also
and
the
roadside
alehouse
to
boot
sir
ralph
assheton
had
several
guests
at
the
abbey
and
others
were
expected
in
the
course
of
the
day
while
doctor
ormerod
had
friends
staying
with
him
at
the
vicarage
soon
after
midnight
on
the
morning
of
the
festival
many
young
persons
of
the
village
of
both
sexes
had
arisen
and
to
the
sound
of
horn
had
repaired
to
the
neighbouring
woods
and
there
gathered
a
vast
stock
of
green
boughs
and
flowering
branches
of
the
hawthorn
wild
roses
and
honeysuckle
with
baskets
of
violets
cowslips
primroses
and
other
wild
flowers
and
returning
in
the
same
order
they
went
forth
fashioned
the
branches
into
green
bowers
within
the
churchyard
or
round
about
the
set
up
on
the
green
and
decorated
them
afterwards
with
garlands
and
crowns
of
flowers
this
morning
ceremonial
ought
to
have
been
performed
without
wetting
the
feet
but
though
some
pains
were
taken
in
the
matter
few
could
achieve
the
difficult
task
except
those
carried
over
the
dewy
grass
by
their
lusty
swains
on
the
day
before
the
rushes
had
been
gathered
and
the
rush
cart
piled
shaped
trimmed
and
adorned
by
those
experienced
in
the
task
and
it
was
one
requiring
both
taste
and
skill
as
will
be
seen
when
the
cart
itself
shall
come
forth
while
others
had
borrowed
for
its
adornment
from
the
abbey
and
elsewhere
silver
tankards
spoons
ladles
brooches
watches
chains
and
bracelets
so
as
to
make
an
imposing
show
day
was
ushered
in
by
a
merry
peal
of
bells
from
the
tower
of
the
old
parish
church
and
the
ringers
practised
all
kinds
of
joyous
changes
during
the
morning
and
fired
many
a
clanging
volley
the
whole
village
was
early
astir
and
as
these
were
times
when
good
hours
were
kept
and
as
early
rising
is
a
famous
sharpener
of
the
appetite
especially
when
attended
with
exercise
so
an
hour
before
noon
the
rustics
one
and
all
sat
down
to
dinner
the
strangers
being
entertained
by
their
friends
and
if
they
had
no
friends
throwing
themselves
upon
the
general
hospitality
the
alehouses
were
reserved
for
tippling
at
a
later
hour
for
it
was
then
customary
for
both
gentleman
and
commoner
male
as
well
as
female
as
will
be
more
fully
shown
hereafter
to
take
their
meals
at
home
and
repair
afterwards
to
houses
of
public
entertainment
for
wine
or
other
liquors
private
chambers
were
of
course
reserved
for
the
gentry
but
not
unfrequently
the
squire
and
his
friends
would
take
their
bottle
with
the
other
guests
such
was
the
invariable
practice
in
the
northern
counties
in
the
reign
of
james
the
first
soon
after
and
when
the
bells
began
to
peal
merrily
again
for
even
ringers
must
recruit
themselves
at
a
small
cottage
in
the
outskirts
of
the
village
and
close
to
the
calder
whose
waters
swept
past
the
trimly
kept
garden
attached
to
it
two
young
girls
were
employed
in
attiring
a
third
who
was
to
represent
maid
marian
or
queen
of
may
in
the
pageant
then
about
to
ensue
and
certainly
by
sovereign
and
prescriptive
right
of
beauty
no
one
better
deserved
the
high
title
and
distinction
conferred
upon
her
than
this
fair
girl
lovelier
maiden
in
the
whole
county
and
however
high
her
degree
than
this
rustic
damsel
it
was
impossible
to
find
and
though
the
becoming
and
fanciful
costume
in
which
she
was
decked
could
not
heighten
her
natural
charms
it
certainly
displayed
them
to
advantage
upon
her
smooth
and
beautiful
brow
sat
a
gilt
crown
while
her
dark
and
luxuriant
hair
covered
behind
with
a
scarlet
coif
embroidered
with
gold
and
tied
with
yellow
white
and
crimson
ribands
but
otherwise
wholly
unconfirmed
swept
down
almost
to
the
ground
slight
and
fragile
her
figure
was
of
such
just
proportion
that
every
movement
and
gesture
had
an
indescribable
charm
the
most
courtly
dame
might
have
envied
her
fine
and
taper
fingers
and
fancied
she
could
improve
them
by
protecting
them
against
the
sun
or
by
rendering
them
snowy
white
with
paste
or
cosmetic
but
this
was
questionable
nothing
certainly
could
improve
the
small
foot
and
ankle
so
well
displayed
in
the
red
hose
and
smart
little
yellow
buskin
fringed
with
gold
a
stomacher
of
scarlet
cloth
braided
with
yellow
lace
in
cross
bars
confined
her
slender
waist
her
robe
was
of
silk
with
wide
sleeves
and
the
skirt
descended
only
a
little
below
the
knee
like
the
dress
of
a
modern
swiss
peasant
so
as
to
reveal
the
exquisite
symmetry
of
her
limbs
over
all
she
wore
a
surcoat
of
azure
silk
lined
with
white
and
edged
with
gold
in
her
left
hand
she
held
a
red
pink
as
an
emblem
of
the
season
so
enchanting
was
her
appearance
altogether
so
fresh
the
character
of
her
beauty
so
bright
the
bloom
that
dyed
her
lovely
checks
that
she
might
have
been
taken
for
a
personification
of
may
herself
she
was
indeed
in
the
very
may
of
life
the
mingling
of
spring
and
summer
in
womanhood
and
the
tender
blue
eyes
bright
and
clear
as
diamonds
of
purest
water
the
soft
regular
features
and
the
merry
mouth
whose
ruddy
parted
lips
ever
and
anon
displayed
two
rows
of
pearls
completed
the
similitude
to
the
attributes
of
the
jocund
month
her
handmaidens
both
of
whom
were
simple
girls
and
though
not
destitute
of
some
pretensions
to
beauty
themselves
in
nowise
to
be
compared
with
her
were
at
the
moment
employed
in
knotting
the
ribands
in
her
hair
and
adjusting
the
azure
surcoat
attentively
watching
these
proceedings
sat
on
a
stool
placed
in
a
corner
a
little
girl
some
nine
or
ten
years
old
with
a
basket
of
flowers
on
her
knee
the
child
was
very
diminutive
even
for
her
age
and
her
smallness
was
increased
by
personal
deformity
occasioned
by
contraction
of
the
chest
and
spinal
curvature
which
raised
her
back
above
her
shoulders
but
her
features
were
sharp
and
cunning
indeed
almost
malignant
and
there
was
a
singular
and
unpleasant
look
about
the
eyes
which
were
not
placed
evenly
in
the
head
altogether
she
had
a
strange
look
and
from
her
habitual
bitterness
of
speech
as
well
as
from
her
vindictive
character
which
young
as
she
was
had
been
displayed
with
some
effect
on
more
than
one
occasion
she
was
no
great
favourite
with
any
one
it
was
curious
now
to
watch
the
eager
and
envious
interest
she
took
in
the
progress
of
her
sister
adornment
for
such
was
the
degree
of
relationship
in
which
she
stood
to
the
may
queen
and
when
the
surcoat
was
finally
adjusted
and
the
last
riband
tied
she
broke
forth
having
hitherto
preserved
a
sullen
silence

at
the

a
sudden
shade
came
over
countenance
changing

slightly
trembling
she
turned
away
from
the

noticing
the
effect
of

could
not

her
triumph

again
alizon
interposed

replied
susan
drying
her
eyes
at
this
moment
a
door
opened
and
a
woman
entered
from
an
inner
room
having
a
hat
on
her
head
and
broad
white
pinners
over
her
cheeks
her
dress
was
of
dark
red
camlet
with
shoes
she
stooped
slightly
and
being
rather
lame
supported
herself
on
a
stick
in
age
she
might
be
between
forty
and
fifty
but
she
looked
much
older
and
her
features
were
not
at
all
prepossessing
from
a
hooked
nose
and
chin
while
their
sinister
effect
was
increased
by
a
formation
of
the
eyes
similar
to
that
in
jennet
only
more
strongly
noticeable
in
her
case
this
woman
was
elizabeth
device
widow
of
john
device
about
whose
death
there
was
a
mystery
to
be
inquired
into
hereafter
and
mother
of
alizon
and
jennet
though
how
she
came
to
have
a
daughter
so
unlike
herself
in
all
respects
as
the
former
no
one
could
conceive
but
so
it
was
soh

of

of

jennet
dealt
her
mother
a
bitterly
vindictive
look
but
she
neither
uttered
cry
nor
made
remark
in
the
momentary
silence
that
ensued
the
blithe
jingling
of
bells
was
heard
accompanied
by
the
merry
sound
of
tabor
and
pipe
ah
here
come
the
and
the
cried
alizon
rushing
joyously
to
the
window
which
being
left
partly
open
admitted
the
scent
of
the
woodbine
and
eglantine
by
which
it
was
overgrown
as
well
as
the
humming
sound
of
the
bees
by
which
the
flowers
were
invaded
almost
immediately
afterwards
a
frolic
troop
like
a
band
of
masquers
approached
the
cottage
and
drew
up
before
it
while
the
jingling
of
bells
ceasing
at
the
same
moment
told
that
the
had
stopped
likewise
chief
amongst
the
party
was
robin
hood
clad
in
a
suit
of
lincoln
green
with
a
sheaf
of
arrows
at
his
back
a
bugle
dangling
from
his
baldric
a
bow
in
his
hand
and
a
green
hat
on
his
head
looped
up
on
one
side
and
decorated
with
a
heron
feather
the
hero
of
sherwood
was
personated
by
a
tall
fellow
to
whom
being
really
a
forester
of
bowland
the
character
was
natural
beside
him
stood
a
very
different
figure
a
jovial
friar
with
shaven
crown
rubicund
cheeks
bull
throat
and
mighty
paunch
covered
by
a
russet
habit
and
girded
in
by
a
red
cord
decorated
with
golden
twist
and
tassel
he
wore
red
hose
and
sandal
shoon
and
carried
in
his
girdle
a
wallet
to
contain
a
roast
capon
a
neat
tongue
or
any
other
dainty
given
him
friar
tuck
for
such
he
was
found
his
representative
in
ned
huddlestone
porter
at
the
abbey
who
as
the
largest
and
stoutest
man
in
the
village
was
chosen
on
that
account
to
the
part
next
to
him
came
a
character
of
no
little
importance
and
upon
whom
much
of
the
mirth
of
the
pageant
depended
and
this
devolved
upon
the
village
cobbler
jack
roby
a
dapper
little
fellow
who
fitted
the
part
of
the
fool
to
a
nicety
with
bauble
in
hand
and
blue
coxcomb
hood
adorned
with
long
white
asses
ears
on
head
with
jerkin
of
green
striped
with
yellow
hose
of
different
colours
the
left
leg
being
yellow
with
a
red
pantoufle
and
the
right
blue
terminated
with
a
yellow
shoe
with
bells
hung
upon
various
parts
of
his
motley
attire
so
that
he
could
not
move
without
producing
a
jingling
sound
jack
roby
looked
wonderful
indeed
and
was
constantly
dancing
about
and
dealing
a
blow
with
his
bauble
next
came
will
scarlet
stukely
and
little
john
all
proper
men
and
tall
attired
in
lincoln
green
like
robin
hood
and
similarly
equipped
like
him
too
they
were
all
foresters
of
bowland
owning
service
to
the
parker
of
browsholme
hall
and
the
representative
of
little
john
who
was
six
feet
and
a
half
high
and
stout
in
proportion
was
lawrence
blackrod
parker
head
keeper
after
the
foresters
came
tom
the
piper
a
wandering
minstrel
habited
for
the
occasion
in
a
blue
doublet
with
sleeves
of
the
same
colour
turned
up
with
yellow
red
hose
and
brown
buskins
red
bonnet
and
green
surcoat
lined
with
yellow
beside
the
piper
was
another
minstrel
similarly
attired
and
provided
with
a
tabor
lastly
came
one
of
the
main
features
of
the
pageant
and
which
together
with
the
fool
contributed
most
materially
to
the
amusement
of
the
spectators
this
was
the
the
hue
of
this
spirited
charger
was
a
pinkish
white
and
his
housings
were
of
crimson
cloth
hanging
to
the
ground
so
as
to
conceal
the
rider
real
legs
though
a
pair
of
sham
ones
dangled
at
the
side
his
bit
was
of
gold
and
his
bridle
red
morocco
leather
while
his
rider
was
very
sumptuously
arrayed
in
a
purple
mantle
bordered
with
gold
with
a
rich
cap
of
the
same
regal
hue
on
his
head
encircled
with
gold
and
having
a
red
feather
stuck
in
it
the
had
a
plume
of
nodding
feathers
on
his
head
and
careered
from
side
to
side
now
rearing
in
front
now
kicking
behind
now
prancing
now
gently
ambling
and
in
short
indulging
in
playful
fancies
and
vagaries
such
as
horse
never
indulged
in
before
to
the
imminent
danger
it
seemed
of
his
rider
and
to
the
huge
delight
of
the
beholders
nor
must
it
be
omitted
as
it
was
matter
of
great
wonderment
to
the
that
by
some
legerdemain
contrivance
the
rider
of
the
had
a
couple
of
daggers
stuck
in
his
cheeks
while
from
his
steed
bridle
hung
a
silver
ladle
which
he
held
now
and
then
to
the
crowd
and
in
which
when
he
did
so
a
few
coins
were
sure
to
rattle
after
the
came
the
not
the
tall
pole
so
called
and
which
was
already
planted
in
the
green
but
a
stout
staff
elevated
some
six
feet
above
the
head
of
the
bearer
with
a
coronal
of
flowers
atop
and
four
long
garlands
hanging
down
each
held
by
a
then
came
the
may
queen
gentleman
usher
a
fantastic
personage
in
habiliments
of
blue
guarded
with
white
and
holding
a
long
willow
wand
in
his
hand
after
the
usher
came
the
main
troop
of
the
men
attired
in
a
graceful
costume
which
set
off
their
light
active
figures
to
advantage
consisting
of
a
of
black
and
white
velvet
with
cut
sleeves
left
open
so
as
to
reveal
the
snowy
shirt
beneath
white
hose
and
shoes
of
black
spanish
leather
with
large
roses
ribands
were
every
where
in
their
dresses
ribands
and
tinsel
adorned
their
caps
ribands
crossed
their
hose
and
ribands
were
tied
round
their
arms
in
either
hand
they
held
a
long
white
handkerchief
knotted
with
ribands
the
female
were
habited
in
white
decorated
like
the
dresses
of
the
men
they
had
ribands
and
wreaths
of
flowers
round
their
heads
bows
in
their
hair
and
in
their
hands
long
white
knotted
kerchiefs
in
the
rear
of
the
performers
in
the
pageant
came
the
drawn
by
a
team
of
eight
stout
horses
with
their
manes
and
tails
tied
with
ribands
their
collars
fringed
with
red
and
yellow
worsted
and
hung
with
bells
which
jingled
blithely
at
every
movement
and
their
heads
decked
with
flowers
the
cart
itself
consisted
of
an
enormous
pile
of
rushes
banded
and
twisted
together
rising
to
a
considerable
height
and
terminated
in
a
sharp
ridge
like
the
point
of
a
gothic
window
the
sides
and
top
were
decorated
with
flowers
and
ribands
and
there
were
eaves
in
front
and
at
the
back
and
on
the
space
within
them
which
was
covered
with
white
paper
were
strings
of
gaudy
flowers
embedded
in
moss
amongst
which
were
suspended
all
the
ornaments
and
finery
that
could
be
collected
for
the
occasion
to
wit
flagons
of
silver
spoons
ladles
chains
watches
and
bracelets
so
as
to
make
a
brave
and
resplendent
show
the
wonder
was
how
articles
of
so
much
value
would
be
trusted
forth
on
such
an
occasion
but
nothing
was
ever
lost
on
the
top
of
the
and
bestriding
its
sharp
ridges
sat
half
a
dozen
men
habited
somewhat
like
the
in
garments
bedecked
with
tinsel
and
ribands
holding
garlands
formed
by
hoops
decorated
with
flowers
and
attached
to
poles
ornamented
with
silver
paper
cut
into
various
figures
and
devices
and
diminishing
gradually
in
size
as
they
rose
to
a
point
where
they
were
crowned
with
wreaths
of
daffodils
a
large
crowd
of
rustics
of
all
ages
accompanied
the
and
this
gay
troop
having
come
to
a
halt
as
described
before
the
cottage
the
entered
it
and
tapping
against
the
inner
door
with
his
wand
took
off
his
cap
as
soon
as
it
was
opened
and
bowing
deferentially
to
the
ground
said
he
was
come
to
invite
the
queen
of
may
to
join
the
pageant
and
that
it
only
awaited
her
presence
to
proceed
to
the
green
having
delivered
this
speech
in
as
good
set
phrase
as
he
could
command
and
being
the
parish
clerk
and
schoolmaster
to
boot
sampson
harrop
by
name
he
was
somewhat
more
polished
than
the
rest
of
the
hinds
and
having
moreover
received
a
gracious
response
from
the
may
queen
who
condescendingly
replied
that
she
was
quite
ready
to
accompany
him
he
took
her
hand
and
led
her
ceremoniously
to
the
door
whither
they
were
followed
by
the
others
loud
was
the
shout
that
greeted
alizon
appearance
and
tremendous
was
the
pushing
to
obtain
a
sight
of
her
and
so
much
was
she
abashed
by
the
enthusiastic
greeting
which
was
wholly
unexpected
on
her
part
that
she
would
have
drawn
back
again
if
it
had
been
possible
but
the
usher
led
her
forward
and
robin
hood
and
the
foresters
having
bent
the
knee
before
her
the
began
to
curvet
anew
among
the
spectators
and
tread
on
their
toes
the
fool
to
rap
their
knuckles
with
his
bauble
the
piper
to
play
the
taborer
to
beat
his
tambourine
and
the
to
toss
their
kerchiefs
over
their
heads
thus
the
pageant
being
put
in
motion
the
began
to
roll
on
its
bells
jingling
merrily
and
the
spectators
cheering
lustily
chapter
the
black
cat
and
the
white
dove
little
jennet
watched
her
sister
triumphant
departure
with
a
look
in
which
there
was
far
more
of
envy
than
sympathy
and
when
her
mother
took
her
hand
to
lead
her
forth
she
would
not
go
but
saying
she
did
not
care
for
any
such
idle
sights
went
back
sullenly
to
the
inner
room
when
there
however
she
could
not
help
peeping
through
the
window
and
saw
susan
and
nancy
join
the
revel
rout
with
feelings
of
increased
bitterness
ey
wish
it
would

so

as

thus
mused
a
great
black
cat
belonging
to
her
mother
which
had
followed
her
into
the
room
rubbed
himself
against
her
putting
up
his
back
and
purring
loudly
ah

the
cat
darted
away
from
her
and
made
two
or
three
skirmishes
round
the
room
as
if
gone
suddenly
mad
ey
con

observed
jennet
laughing
all
at

the
cat
bounded
upon

placed

sampler

with
the
name

with
some
distrust
the
animal

against

as

the
cat
again
dashed
twice
or
thrice
madly
round
the
room
and
then
stopping
suddenly
at
the
hearth
sprang
up
the
chimney
frightened
ye
away
ot
onny
rate
observed
jennet
laughing
and
yet
it
may
mean
summot
she
added
reflecting
a
little
fo
heerd
say
os
how
witches
fly
up
chimleys
o
broomsticks
to
attend
their
sabbaths
ey

alizon
ey
dunna
knoa
whot

nah
do
to
be
like
her
again
the
great
black
cat
was
beside
her
rubbing
against
her
and
purring
the
child
was
a
good
deal
startled
for
she
had
not
seen
him
return
and
the
door
was
shut
though
he
might
have
come
in
through
the
open
window
only
she
had
been
looking
that
way
all
the
time
and
had
never
noticed
him
strange
tib
said
the
child
patting
him
thou
hasna
answered
my
last
question
how
is
one
to
become
a
witch
as
she
made
this
inquiry
the
cat
suddenly
scratched
her
in
the
arm
so
that
the
blood
came
the
little
girl
was
a
good
deal
frightened
as
well
as
hurt
and
withdrawing
her
arm
quickly
made
a
motion
of
striking
the
animal
but
starting
backwards
erecting
his
tail
and
spitting
the
cat
assumed
such
a
formidable
appearance
that
she
did
not
dare
to
touch
him
and
she
then
perceived
that
some
drops
of
blood
stained
her
white
sleeve
giving
the
spots
a
certain
resemblance
to
the
letters
and
her
own
initials
at
this
moment
when
she
was
about
to
scream
for
help
though
she
knew
no
one
was
in
the
house
all
having
gone
away
with
the
revellers
a
small
white
dove
flew
in
at
the
open
window
and
skimming
round
the
room
alighted
near
her
no
sooner
had
the
cat
caught
sight
of
this
beautiful
bird
than
instead
of
preparing
to
pounce
upon
it
as
might
have
been
expected
he
instantly
abandoned
his
fierce
attitude
and
uttering
a
sort
of
howl
sprang
up
the
chimney
as
before
but
the
child
scarcely
observed
this
her
attention
being
directed
towards
the
bird
whose
extreme
beauty
delighted
her
it
seemed
quite
tame
too
and
allowed
itself
to
be
touched
and
even
drawn
towards
her
without
an
effort
to
escape
never
surely
was
seen
so
beautiful
a
bird
with
such
milkwhite
feathers
such
red
legs
and
such
pretty
yellow
eyes
with
crimson
circles
round
them
so
thought
the
little
girl
as
she
gazed
at
it
and
pressed
it
to
her
bosom
in
doing
this
gentle
and
good
thoughts
came
upon
her
and
she
reflected
what
a
nice
present
this
pretty
bird
would
make
to
her
sister
alizon
on
her
return
from
the
and
how
pleased
she
should
feel
to
give
it
to
her
and
then
she
thought
of
alizon
constant
kindness
to
her
and
half
reproached
herself
with
the
poor
return
she
made
for
it
wondering
she
could
entertain
any
feelings
of
envy
towards
one
so
good
and
amiable
all
this
while
the
dove
nestled
in
her
bosom
while
thus
pondering
the
little
girl
felt
an
unaccountable
drowsiness
steal
over
her
and
presently
afterwards
dropped
asleep
when
she
had
a
very
strange
dream
it
seemed
to
her
that
there
was
a
contest
going
on
between
two
spirits
a
good
one
and
a
bad
the
bad
one
being
represented
by
the
great
black
cat
and
the
good
spirit
by
the
white
dove
what
they
were
striving
about
she
could
not
exactly
tell
but
she
felt
that
the
conflict
had
some
relation
to
herself
the
dove
at
first
appeared
to
have
but
a
poor
chance
against
the
claws
of
its
sable
adversary
but
the
sharp
talons
of
the
latter
made
no
impression
upon
the
white
plumage
of
the
bird
which
now
shone
like
silver
armour
and
in
the
end
the
cat
fled
yelling
as
it
darted
off
thou
art
victorious
now
but
her
soul
shall
yet
be
mine
something
awakened
the
little
sleeper
at
the
same
moment
and
she
felt
very
much
terrified
at
her
dream
as
she
could
not
help
thinking
her
own
soul
might
be
the
one
in
jeopardy
and
her
first
impulse
was
to
see
whether
the
white
dove
was
safe
yes
there
it
was
still
nestling
in
her
bosom
with
its
head
under
its
wing
just
then
she
was
startled
at
hearing
her
own
name
pronounced
by
a
hoarse
voice
and
looking
up
she
beheld
a
tall
young
man
standing
at
the
window
he
had
a
somewhat
gipsy
look
having
a
dark
olive
complexion
and
fine
black
eyes
though
set
strangely
in
his
head
like
those
of
jennet
and
her
mother
coal
black
hair
and
very
prominent
features
of
a
sullen
and
almost
savage
cast
his
figure
was
gaunt
but
very
muscular
his
arms
being
extremely
long
and
his
hands
unusually
large
and
bony
personal
advantages
which
made
him
a
formidable
antagonist
in
any
rustic
encounter
and
in
such
he
was
frequently
engaged
being
of
a
very
irascible
temper
and
turbulent
disposition
he
was
clad
in
a
holiday
suit
of
serge
which
fitted
him
well
and
carried
a
nosegay
in
one
hand
and
a
stout
blackthorn
cudgel
in
the
other
this
young
man
was
james
device
son
of
elizabeth
and
some
four
or
five
years
older
than
alizon
he
did
not
live
with
his
mother
in
whalley
but
in
pendle
forest
near
his
old
relative
mother
demdike
and
had
come
over
that
morning
to
attend
the
wake
whot

abowt
jennet
inquired
james
device
in
tones
naturally
hoarse
and
deep
and
which
he
took
as
little
pains
to
soften
as
he
did
to
polish
his
manners
which
were
more
than
ordinarily
rude
and
churlish
whot

as
she
came
out
she
found
her
brother
whistling
the
blithe
air
of
green
sleeves
cutting
strange
capers
in
imitation
of
the
and
whirling
his
cudgel
over
his
head
instead
of
a
kerchief
the
gaiety
of
the
day
seemed
infectious
and
to
have
seized
even
him
people
stared
to
see
black
jem
or
surly
jem
as
he
was
indifferently
called
so
joyous
and
wondered
what
it
could
mean
he
then
fell
to
singing
a
snatch
of
a
local
ballad
at
that
time
in
vogue
in
the
neighbourhood
if

suddenly
in

and
snatching
his

a

jennet
determined

a

echoed

rather
testily

he
added
noticing

red

on

han
ey
she
rejoined
evasively
oh

ey
rekilect
it
wos

it

echoed
jem
gravely
and
glancing
uneasily
at
the
marks
meanwhile
on
quitting
the
cottage
the
revellers
had
proceeded
slowly
towards
the
green
increasing
the
number
of
their
followers
at
each
little
tenement
they
passed
and
being
welcomed
every
where
with
shouts
and
cheers
the
curveted
and
capered
the
fool
fleered
at
the
girls
and
flouted
the
men
jesting
with
every
one
and
when
failing
in
a
point
rapping
the
knuckles
of
his
auditors
friar
tuck
chucked
the
pretty
girls
under
the
chin
in
defiance
of
their
sweethearts
and
stole
a
kiss
from
every
buxom
dame
that
stood
in
his
way
and
then
snapped
his
fingers
or
made
a
broad
grimace
at
the
husband
the
piper
played
and
the
taborer
rattled
his
tambourine
the
tossed
their
kerchiefs
aloft
and
the
bells
of
the
jingled
merrily
the
men
on
the
top
being
on
a
level
with
the
roofs
of
the
cottages
and
the
summits
of
the
haystacks
they
passed
but
in
spite
of
their
exalted
position
jesting
with
the
crowd
below
but
in
spite
of
these
multiplied
attractions
and
in
spite
of
the
gambols
of
fool
and
horse
though
the
latter
elicited
prodigious
laughter
the
main
attention
was
fixed
on
the
may
queen
who
tripped
lightly
along
by
the
side
of
her
faithful
squire
robin
hood
followed
by
the
three
bold
foresters
of
sherwood
and
her
usher
in
this
way
they
reached
the
green
where
already
a
large
crowd
was
collected
to
see
them
and
where
in
the
midst
of
it
and
above
the
heads
of
the
assemblage
rose
the
lofty
with
all
its
flowery
garlands
glittering
in
the
sunshine
and
its
ribands
fluttering
in
the
breeze
pleasant
was
it
to
see
those
cheerful
groups
composed
of
happy
rustics
youths
in
their
holiday
attire
and
maidens
neatly
habited
too
and
fresh
and
bright
as
the
day
itself
summer
sunshine
sparkled
in
their
eyes
and
weather
and
circumstance
as
well
as
genial
natures
disposed
them
to
enjoyment
every
lass
above
eighteen
had
her
sweetheart
and
old
couples
nodded
and
smiled
at
each
other
when
any
tender
speech
broadly
conveyed
but
tenderly
conceived
reached
their
ears
and
said
it
recalled
the
days
of
their
youth
pleasant
was
it
to
hear
such
honest
laughter
and
such
good
homely
jests
laugh
on
my
merry
lads
you
are
made
of
good
old
english
stuff
loyal
to
church
and
king
and
while
you
and
such
as
you
last
our
land
will
be
in
no
danger
from
foreign
foe
laugh
on
and
praise
your
sweethearts
how
you
will
laugh
on
and
blessings
on
your
honest
hearts
the
frolic
train
had
just
reached
the
precincts
of
the
green
when
the
usher
waving
his
wand
aloft
called
a
momentary
halt
announcing
that
sir
ralph
assheton
and
the
gentry
were
coming
forth
from
the
abbey
gate
to
meet
them
chapter
the
asshetons
between
sir
ralph
assheton
of
the
abbey
and
the
inhabitants
of
whalley
many
of
whom
were
his
tenants
he
being
joint
lord
of
the
manor
with
john
braddyll
of
portfield
the
best
possible
feeling
subsisted
for
though
somewhat
austere
in
manner
and
tinctured
with
puritanism
the
worthy
knight
was
sufficiently
shrewd
or
more
correctly
speaking
sufficiently
to
be
tolerant
of
the
opinions
of
others
and
being
moreover
sincere
in
his
own
religious
views
no
man
could
call
him
in
question
for
them
besides
which
he
was
very
hospitable
to
his
friends
very
bountiful
to
the
poor
a
good
landlord
and
a
humane
man
his
very
austerity
of
manner
tempered
by
stately
courtesy
added
to
the
respect
he
inspired
especially
as
he
could
now
and
then
relax
into
gaiety
and
when
he
did
so
his
smile
was
accounted
singularly
sweet
but
in
general
he
was
grave
and
formal
stiff
in
attire
and
stiff
in
gait
cold
and
punctilious
in
manner
precise
in
speech
and
exacting
in
due
respect
from
both
high
and
low
which
was
seldom
if
ever
refused
him
amongst
sir
ralph
other
good
qualities
for
such
it
was
esteemed
by
his
friends
and
retainers
and
they
were
of
course
the
best
judges
was
a
strong
love
of
the
chase
and
perhaps
he
indulged
a
little
too
freely
in
the
sports
of
the
field
for
a
gentleman
of
a
character
so
staid
and
decorous
but
his
popularity
was
far
from
being
diminished
by
the
circumstance
neither
did
he
suffer
the
rude
and
boisterous
companionship
into
which
he
was
brought
by
indulgence
in
this
his
favourite
pursuit
in
any
way
to
affect
him
though
still
young
sir
ralph
was
prematurely
grey
and
this
combined
with
the
sad
severity
of
his
aspect
gave
him
the
air
of
one
considerably
past
the
middle
term
of
life
though
this
appearance
was
contradicted
again
by
the
youthful
fire
of
his
eagle
eye
his
features
were
handsome
and
strongly
marked
and
he
wore
a
pointed
beard
and
mustaches
with
a
shaved
cheek
sir
ralph
assheton
had
married
twice
his
first
wife
being
a
daughter
of
sir
james
bellingham
of
levens
in
northumberland
by
whom
he
had
two
children
while
his
second
choice
fell
upon
eleanor
shuttleworth
the
lovely
and
heiress
of
gawthorpe
to
whom
he
had
been
recently
united
in
his
attire
even
when
habited
for
the
chase
or
a
like
the
present
the
knight
of
whalley
affected
a
sombre
colour
and
ordinarily
wore
a
quilted
doublet
of
black
silk
immense
trunk
hose
of
the
same
material
stiffened
with
whalebone
puffed
out
sleeves
falling
bands
for
he
eschewed
the
ruff
as
savouring
of
vanity
boots
of
black
flexible
leather
ascending
to
the
hose
and
armed
with
spurs
with
gigantic
rowels
a
black
hat
with
an
ostrich
feather
placed
in
the
side
and
hanging
over
the
top
a
long
rapier
on
his
hip
and
a
dagger
in
his
girdle
this
buckram
attire
it
will
be
easily
conceived
contributed
no
little
to
the
natural
stiffness
of
his
thin
tall
figure
sir
ralph
assheton
was
great
grandson
of
richard
assheton
who
flourished
in
the
time
of
abbot
paslew
and
who
in
conjunction
with
john
braddyll
fourteen
years
after
the
unfortunate
prelate
attainder
and
the
dissolution
of
the
monastery
had
purchased
the
abbey
and
domains
of
whalley
from
the
crown
subsequently
to
which
a
division
of
the
property
so
granted
took
place
between
them
the
abbey
and
part
of
the
manor
falling
to
the
share
of
richard
assheton
whose
descendants
had
now
for
three
generations
made
it
their
residence
thus
the
whole
of
whalley
belonged
to
the
families
of
assheton
and
braddyll
which
had
intermarried
the
latter
as
has
been
stated
dwelling
at
portfield
a
fine
old
seat
in
the
neighbourhood
a
very
different
person
from
sir
ralph
was
his
cousin
nicholas
assheton
of
downham
who
except
as
regards
his
puritanism
might
be
considered
a
type
of
the
lancashire
squire
of
the
day
a
precisian
in
religious
notions
and
constant
in
attendance
at
church
and
lecture
he
put
no
sort
of
restraint
upon
himself
but
mixed
up
shooting
at
the
mark
and
perhaps
shooting
with
the
and
in
fact
every
other
kind
of
country
diversion
not
forgetting
tippling
cards
and
dicing
with
daily
devotion
discourses
and
in
the
oddest
way
imaginable
a
thorough
sportsman
was
squire
nicholas
assheton
well
versed
in
all
the
arts
and
mysteries
of
hawking
and
hunting
not
a
man
in
the
county
could
ride
harder
hunt
deer
unkennel
fox
unearth
badger
or
spear
otter
better
than
he
and
then
as
to
tippling
he
would
sit
you
a
whole
afternoon
at
the
alehouse
and
be
the
merriest
man
there
and
drink
a
bout
with
every
farmer
present
and
if
the
parson
chanced
to
be
out
of
hearing
he
would
never
make
a
mouth
at
a
round
oath
nor
choose
a
second
expression
when
the
first
would
serve
his
turn
then
who
so
constant
at
church
or
lecture
as
squire
nicholas
though
he
did
snore
sometimes
during
the
long
sermons
of
his
cousin
the
rector
of
middleton
a
great
man
was
he
at
all
weddings
christenings
churchings
and
funerals
and
never
neglected
his
bottle
at
these
ceremonies
nor
any
sport
in
doors
or
out
of
doors
meanwhile
in
short
such
a
roystering
puritan
was
never
known
a
young
man
was
the
squire
of
downham
possessed
of
a
very
athletic
frame
and
a
most
vigorous
constitution
which
helped
him
together
with
the
prodigious
exercise
he
took
through
any
excess
he
had
a
sanguine
complexion
with
a
broad
visage
which
he
could
lengthen
at
will
in
a
surprising
manner
his
hair
was
cropped
close
to
his
head
and
the
razor
did
daily
duty
over
his
cheek
and
chin
giving
him
the
roundhead
look
some
years
later
characteristic
of
the
puritanical
party
nicholas
had
taken
to
wife
dorothy
daughter
of
richard
greenacres
of
worston
and
was
most
fortunate
in
his
choice
which
is
more
than
can
be
said
for
his
lady
for
i
can
not
uphold
the
squire
as
a
model
of
conjugal
fidelity
report
affirmed
that
he
loved
more
than
one
pretty
girl
under
the
rose
squire
nicholas
was
not
particular
as
to
the
quality
or
make
of
his
clothes
provided
they
wore
well
and
protected
him
against
the
weather
and
was
generally
to
be
seen
in
doublet
and
hose
of
stout
fustian
which
had
seen
some
service
with
a
hat
originally
green
but
of
late
bleached
to
a
much
lighter
colour
but
he
was
clad
on
this
particular
occasion
in
habiliments
fresh
from
the
hands
with
buff
boots
drawn
up
to
the
knee
and
a
new
round
hat
from
york
with
a
green
feather
in
it
his
legs
were
slightly
embowed
and
he
bore
himself
like
a
man
rarely
out
of
the
saddle
downham
the
residence
of
the
squire
was
a
fine
old
house
very
charmingly
situated
to
the
north
of
pendle
hill
of
which
it
commanded
a
magnificent
view
and
a
few
miles
from
clithero
the
grounds
about
it
were
and
beautifully
broken
and
diversified
watered
by
the
ribble
and
opening
upon
the
lovely
and
extensive
valley
deriving
its
name
from
that
stream
the
house
was
in
good
order
and
well
maintained
and
the
stables
plentifully
furnished
with
horses
while
the
hall
was
adorned
with
various
trophies
and
implements
of
the
chase
but
as
i
propose
paying
its
owner
a
visit
i
shall
defer
any
further
description
of
the
place
till
an
opportunity
arrives
for
examining
it
in
detail
a
third
cousin
of
sir
ralph
though
in
the
second
degree
likewise
present
on
the
in
question
was
the
reverend
abdias
assheton
rector
of
middleton
a
very
worthy
man
who
though
differing
from
his
kinsmen
upon
some
religious
points
and
not
altogether
approving
of
the
conduct
of
one
of
them
was
on
good
terms
with
both
the
rector
of
middleton
was
portly
and
fond
of
ease
and
reading
and
by
no
means
indifferent
to
the
good
things
of
life
he
was
unmarried
and
passed
much
of
his
time
at
middleton
hall
the
seat
of
his
near
relative
sir
richard
assheton
to
whose
family
he
was
greatly
attached
and
whose
residence
closely
adjoined
the
rectory
a
fourth
cousin
also
present
was
young
richard
assheton
of
middleton
eldest
son
and
heir
of
the
owner
of
that
estate
possessed
of
all
the
good
qualities
largely
distributed
among
his
kinsmen
with
none
of
their
drawbacks
this
young
man
was
as
tolerant
and
bountiful
as
sir
ralph
without
his
austerity
and
sectarianism
as
keen
a
sportsman
and
as
bold
a
rider
as
nicholas
without
his
propensities
to
excess
as
studious
at
times
and
as
well
read
as
abdias
without
his
laziness
and
and
as
courtly
and
as
his
father
sir
richard
who
was
esteemed
one
of
the
most
perfect
gentlemen
in
the
county
without
his
haughtiness
then
he
was
the
handsomest
of
his
race
though
the
asshetons
were
accounted
the
handsomest
family
in
lancashire
and
no
one
minded
yielding
the
palm
to
young
richard
even
if
it
could
be
contested
he
was
so
modest
and
unassuming
at
this
time
richard
assheton
was
about
tall
gracefully
and
slightly
formed
but
possessed
of
such
remarkable
vigour
that
even
his
cousin
nicholas
could
scarcely
compete
with
him
in
athletic
exercises
his
features
were
fine
and
regular
with
an
almost
phrygian
precision
of
outline
his
hair
was
of
a
dark
brown
and
fell
in
clustering
curls
over
his
brow
and
neck
and
his
complexion
was
fresh
and
blooming
and
set
off
by
a
slight
beard
and
mustache
carefully
trimmed
and
pointed
his
dress
consisted
of
a
doublet
with
wide
velvet
hose
embroidered
and
fringed
descending
nearly
to
the
knee
where
they
were
tied
with
points
and
ribands
met
by
dark
stockings
and
terminated
by
red
velvet
shoes
with
roses
in
them
a
white
feather
adorned
his
black
hat
and
he
had
a
rapier
by
his
side
amongst
sir
ralph
assheton
guests
were
richard
greenacres
of
worston
nicholas
assheton
richard
sherborne
of
dunnow
near
sladeburne
who
had
married
dorothy
nicholas
sister
mistress
robinson
of
raydale
house
aunt
to
the
knight
and
the
squire
and
two
of
her
sons
both
stout
youths
with
john
braddyll
and
his
wife
of
portfield
besides
these
there
was
master
roger
nowell
a
justice
of
the
peace
in
the
county
and
a
very
active
and
busy
one
too
who
had
been
invited
for
an
especial
purpose
to
be
explained
hereafter
head
of
an
ancient
lancashire
family
residing
at
read
a
fine
old
hall
some
little
distance
from
whalley
roger
nowell
though
a
worthy
man
dealt
hard
measure
from
the
bench
and
seldom
tempered
justice
with
mercy
he
was
dry
and
sarcastic
and
being
adverse
to
country
sports
his
presence
on
the
occasion
was
the
only
thing
likely
to
impose
restraint
on
the
revellers
other
guests
there
were
but
none
of
particular
note
the
ladies
of
the
party
consisted
of
lady
assheton
mistress
nicholas
assheton
of
downham
dorothy
assheton
of
middleton
sister
to
richard
a
lovely
girl
of
eighteen
with
light
fleecy
hair
summer
blue
eyes
and
a
complexion
of
exquisite
purity
mistress
sherborne
of
dunnow
mistress
robinson
of
raydale
and
mistress
braddyll
of
portfield
before
mentioned
together
with
the
wives
and
daughters
of
some
others
of
the
neighbouring
gentry
most
noticeable
amongst
whom
was
mistress
alice
nutter
of
rough
lee
in
pendle
forest
a
widow
lady
and
a
relative
of
the
assheton
family
mistress
nutter
might
be
a
year
or
two
turned
of
forty
but
she
still
retained
a
very
fine
figure
and
much
beauty
of
feature
though
of
a
cold
and
disagreeable
cast
she
was
dressed
in
mourning
though
her
husband
had
been
dead
several
years
and
her
rich
dark
habiliments
well
became
her
pale
complexion
and
raven
hair
a
proud
poor
gentleman
was
richard
nutter
her
late
husband
and
his
scanty
means
not
enabling
him
to
keep
up
as
large
an
establishment
as
he
desired
or
to
be
as
hospitable
as
his
nature
prompted
his
temper
became
soured
and
he
visited
his
ill
humours
upon
his
wife
who
devotedly
attached
to
him
to
all
outward
appearance
at
least
never
resented
his
ill
treatment
all
at
once
and
without
any
previous
symptoms
of
ailment
or
apparent
cause
unless
it
might
be
in
hunting
the
day
before
richard
nutter
was
seized
with
a
strange
and
violent
illness
which
after
three
or
four
days
of
acute
suffering
brought
him
to
the
grave
during
his
illness
he
was
constantly
and
zealously
tended
by
his
wife
but
he
displayed
great
aversion
to
her
declaring
himself
bewitched
and
that
an
old
woman
was
ever
in
the
corner
of
his
room
mumbling
wicked
enchantments
against
him
but
as
no
such
old
woman
could
be
seen
these
assertions
were
treated
as
delirious
ravings
they
were
not
however
forgotten
after
his
death
and
some
people
said
that
he
had
certainly
been
bewitched
and
that
a
waxen
image
made
in
his
likeness
and
stuck
full
of
pins
had
been
picked
up
in
his
chamber
by
mistress
alice
and
cast
into
the
fire
and
as
soon
as
it
melted
he
had
expired
such
tales
only
obtained
credence
with
the
common
folk
but
as
pendle
forest
was
a
sort
of
weird
region
many
reputed
witches
dwelling
in
it
they
were
the
more
readily
believed
even
by
those
who
acquitted
mistress
nutter
of
all
share
in
the
dark
transaction
mistress
nutter
gave
the
best
proof
that
she
respected
her
memory
by
not
marrying
again
and
she
continued
to
lead
a
very
secluded
life
at
rough
lee
a
lonesome
house
in
the
heart
of
the
forest
she
lived
quite
by
herself
for
she
had
no
children
her
only
daughter
having
perished
somewhat
strangely
when
quite
an
infant
though
a
relative
of
the
asshetons
she
kept
up
little
intimacy
with
them
and
it
was
a
matter
of
surprise
to
all
that
she
had
been
drawn
from
her
seclusion
to
attend
the
present
revel
her
motive
however
in
visiting
the
abbey
was
to
obtain
the
assistance
of
sir
ralph
assheton
in
settling
a
dispute
between
her
and
roger
nowell
relative
to
the
boundary
line
of
part
of
their
properties
which
came
together
and
this
was
the
reason
why
the
magistrate
had
been
invited
to
whalley
after
hearing
both
sides
of
the
question
and
examining
plans
of
the
estates
which
he
knew
to
be
accurate
sir
ralph
who
had
been
appointed
umpire
pronounced
a
decision
in
favour
of
roger
nowell
but
mistress
nutter
refusing
to
abide
by
it
the
settlement
of
the
matter
was
postponed
till
the
day
but
one
following
between
which
time
the
landmarks
were
to
be
investigated
by
a
certain
little
lawyer
named
potts
who
attended
on
behalf
of
roger
nowell
together
with
nicholas
and
richard
assheton
on
behalf
of
mistress
nutter
upon
their
evidence
it
was
agreed
by
both
parties
that
sir
ralph
should
pronounce
a
final
decision
to
be
accepted
by
them
and
to
that
effect
they
signed
an
agreement
the
three
persons
appointed
to
the
investigation
settled
to
start
for
rough
lee
early
on
the
following
morning
a
word
as
to
master
thomas
potts
this
worthy
was
an
attorney
from
london
who
had
officiated
as
clerk
of
the
court
at
the
assizes
at
lancaster
where
his
quickness
had
so
much
pleased
roger
nowell
that
he
sent
for
him
to
read
to
manage
this
particular
business
a
fellow
was
potts
and
versed
in
all
the
quirks
and
tricks
of
a
very
subtle
profession
not
provided
a
client
would
pay
well
prepared
to
resort
to
any
expedient
to
gain
his
object
and
quite
conversant
enough
with
both
practice
and
precedent
to
keep
himself
straight
a
bustling
consequential
little
personage
was
he
moreover
very
fond
of
delivering
an
opinion
even
when
unasked
and
of
a
meddling
turn
constantly
setting
men
by
the
ears
a
suit
of
rusty
black
a
skin
small
wizen
features
a
nose
scant
eyebrows
and
a
great
yellow
forehead
constituted
his
external
man
he
partook
of
the
hospitality
at
the
abbey
but
had
his
quarters
at
the
dragon
he
it
was
who
counselled
roger
nowell
to
abide
by
the
decision
of
sir
ralph
confidently
assuring
him
that
he
must
carry
his
point
this
dispute
was
not
however
the
only
one
the
knight
had
to
adjust
or
in
which
master
potts
was
concerned
a
claim
had
recently
been
made
by
a
certain
sir
thomas
metcalfe
of
nappay
in
wensleydale
near
bainbridge
to
the
house
and
manor
of
raydale
belonging
to
his
neighbour
john
robinson
whose
lady
as
has
been
shown
was
a
relative
of
the
asshetons
robinson
himself
had
gone
to
london
to
obtain
advice
on
the
subject
while
sir
thomas
metcalfe
who
was
a
man
of
violent
disposition
had
threatened
to
take
forcible
possession
of
raydale
if
it
were
not
delivered
to
him
without
delay
and
to
eject
the
robinson
family
having
consulted
potts
however
on
the
subject
whom
he
had
met
at
read
the
latter
strongly
dissuaded
him
from
the
course
and
recommended
him
to
call
to
his
aid
the
strong
arm
of
the
law
but
this
he
rejected
though
he
ultimately
agreed
to
refer
the
matter
to
sir
ralph
assheton
and
for
this
purpose
he
had
come
over
to
whalley
and
was
at
present
a
guest
at
the
vicarage
thus
it
will
be
seen
that
sir
ralph
assheton
had
his
hands
full
while
the
little
london
lawyer
master
potts
was
tolerably
well
occupied
besides
sir
thomas
metcalfe
sir
richard
molyneux
and
parker
of
browsholme
were
guests
of
ormerod
at
the
vicarage
such
was
the
large
company
assembled
to
witness
the
revels
at
whalley
and
if
harmonious
feelings
did
not
exist
amongst
all
of
them
little
outward
manifestation
was
made
of
enmity
the
dresses
and
appointments
of
the
pageant
having
been
provided
by
sir
ralph
assheton
who
puritan
as
he
was
encouraged
all
harmless
country
pastimes
it
was
deemed
necessary
to
pay
him
every
respect
even
if
no
other
feeling
would
have
prompted
the
attention
and
therefore
the
troop
had
stopped
on
seeing
him
and
his
guests
issue
from
the
abbey
gate
at
pretty
nearly
the
same
time
doctor
ormerod
and
his
party
came
from
the
vicarage
towards
the
green
no
order
of
march
was
observed
but
sir
ralph
and
his
lady
with
two
of
his
children
by
the
former
marriage
walked
first
then
came
some
of
the
other
ladies
with
the
rector
of
middleton
john
braddyll
and
the
two
sons
of
mistress
robinson
next
came
mistress
nutter
roger
nowell
and
potts
walking
after
her
eyeing
her
maliciously
as
her
proud
figure
swept
on
before
them
even
if
she
saw
their
looks
or
overheard
their
jeers
she
did
not
deign
to
notice
them
lastly
came
young
richard
assheton
of
middleton
and
squire
nicholas
both
in
high
spirits
and
laughing
and
chatting
together
a
brave
day

the
cousin

nicholas
assheton
as
they
approached

of

i
hope
the
parson
did
hear
me
he
added
turning
round
quickly
well
well
i
come
down
when
the
dancing
over
and
we
make
a
night
of
it
and
he
ran
on
to
overtake
richard
assheton
by
this
time
the
respective
parties
from
the
abbey
and
the
vicarage
having
united
they
walked
on
together
sir
ralph
assheton
after
courteously
exchanging
salutations
with
ormerod
guests
still
keeping
a
little
in
advance
of
the
company
sir
thomas
metcalfe
comported
himself
with
more
than
his
wonted
haughtiness
and
bowed
so
superciliously
to
mistress
robinson
that
her
two
sons
glanced
angrily
at
each
other
as
if
in
doubt
whether
they
should
not
instantly
resent
the
affront
observing
this
as
well
as
what
had
previously
taken
place
nicholas
assheton
stepped
quickly
up
to
them
and
said
keep
quiet
lads
leave
this
dunghill
cock
to
me
and
i
lower
his
crest
with
this
he
pushed
forward
and
elbowing
sir
thomas
rudely
out
of
the
way
turned
round
and
instead
of
apologising
eyed
him
coolly
and
contemptuously
from
head
to
foot
are
you
drunk
sir
that
you
forget
your
manners
asked
sir
thomas
laying
his
hand
upon
his
sword
not
so
drunk
but
that
i
know
how
to
conduct
myself
like
a
gentleman
sir
thomas
rejoined
nicholas
which
is
more
than
can
be
said
for
a
certain
person
of
my
acquaintance
who
for
aught
i
know
has
only
taken
his
morning
pint
you
wish
to
pick
a
quarrel
with
me
master
nicholas
assheton
i
perceive
said
sir
thomas
stepping
close
up
to
him
and
i
will
not
disappoint
you
you
shall
render
me
good
reason
for
this
affront
before
i
leave
whalley
when
and
where
you
please
sir
thomas
rejoined
nicholas
laughing
at
any
hour
and
at
any
weapon
i
am
your
man
at
this
moment
master
potts
who
had
scented
a
quarrel
afar
and
who
would
have
liked
it
well
enough
if
its
prosecution
had
not
run
counter
to
his
own
interests
quitted
roger
nowell
and
ran
back
to
metcalfe
and
plucking
him
by
the
sleeve
said
in
a
low
voice
this
is
not
the
way
to
obtain
quiet
possession
of
raydale
house
sir
thomas
master
nicholas
assheton
he
added
turning
to
him
i
must
entreat
you
my
good
sir
to
be
moderate
gentlemen
both
i
caution
you
that
i
have
my
eye
upon
you
you
well
know
there
is
a
magistrate
here
my
singular
good
friend
and
honoured
client
master
roger
nowell
and
if
you
pursue
this
quarrel
further
i
shall
hold
it
my
duty
to
have
you
bound
over
by
that
worthy
gentleman
in
sufficient
securities
to
keep
the
peace
towards
our
sovereign
lord
the
king
and
all
his
lieges
and
particularly
towards
each
other
you
understand
me
gentlemen
perfectly
replied
nicholas
i
drink
at
john
lawe
sir
thomas
so
saying
he
walked
away
metcalfe
would
have
followed
him
but
was
withheld
by
potts
let
him
go
sir
thomas
said
the
little
man
of
law
let
him
go
once
master
of
raydale
you
can
do
as
you
please
leave
the
settlement
of
the
matter
to
me
i
just
whisper
a
word
in
sir
ralph
assheton
ear
and
you
hear
no
more
of
it
fire
and
fury
growled
sir
thomas
i
like
not
this
mode
of
settling
a
quarrel
and
unless
this
puritan
apologises
i
shall
assuredly
cut
his
throat
or
he
yours
good
sir
thomas
rejoined
potts
better
sit
in
raydale
hall
than
lie
in
the
abbey
vaults
well
we
talk
over
the
matter
master
potts
replied
the
knight
a
nice
morning
work
i
made
of
it
mused
nicholas
as
he
walked
along
here
i
have
a
dance
with
a
farmer
pretty
wife
a
discourse
with
a
parson
a
with
a
couple
of
clowns
and
a
duello
with
a
blustering
knight
on
my
hands
quite
enough
o
my
conscience
but
i
must
get
through
it
the
best
way
i
can
and
now
hey
for
the
and
the
nicholas
just
got
up
in
time
to
witness
the
presentation
of
the
may
queen
to
sir
ralph
assheton
and
his
lady
and
like
every
one
else
he
was
greatly
struck
by
her
extreme
beauty
and
natural
grace
the
little
ceremony
was
thus
conducted
when
the
company
from
the
abbey
drew
near
the
troop
of
revellers
the
usher
taking
alizon
hand
in
the
tips
of
his
fingers
as
before
strutted
forward
with
her
to
sir
ralph
and
his
lady
and
falling
upon
one
knee
before
them
said
most
worshipful
and
honoured
knight
and
you
his
lovely
dame
and
you
the
tender
and
cherished
olive
branches
growing
round
about
their
tables
i
hereby
crave
your
gracious
permission
to
present
unto
your
honours
our
chosen
queen
of
may
somewhat
fluttered
by
the
presentation
alizon
yet
maintained
sufficient
composure
to
bend
gracefully
before
lady
assheton
and
say
in
a
very
sweet
voice
i
fear
your
ladyship
will
think
the
choice
of
the
village
hath
fallen
ill
in
alighting
upon
me
and
indeed
i
feel
myself
altogether
unworthy
the
distinction
nevertheless
i
will
endeavour
to
discharge
my
office
fittingly
and
therefore
pray
you
fair
lady
and
the
worshipful
knight
your
husband
together
with
your
beauteous
children
and
the
gentles
all
by
whom
you
are
surrounded
to
grace
our
little
festival
with
your
presence
hoping
you
may
find
as
much
pleasure
in
the
sight
as
we
shall
do
in
offering
it
to
you
a
fair
maid
and
modest
as
she
is
fair
observed
sir
ralph
with
a
condescending
smile
in
sooth
is
she
replied
lady
assheton
raising
her
kindly
and
saying
as
she
did
so
nay
you
must
not
kneel
to
us
sweet
maid
you
are
queen
of
may
and
it
is
for
us
to
show
respect
to
you
during
your
day
of
sovereignty
your
wishes
are
commands
and
in
behalf
of
my
husband
my
children
and
our
guests
i
answer
that
we
will
gladly
attend
your
revels
on
the
green
well
said
dear
nell
observed
sir
ralph
we
should
be
churlish
indeed
were
we
to
refuse
the
bidding
of
so
lovely
a
queen
nay
you
have
called
the
roses
in
earnest
to
her
cheek
now
sir
ralph
observed
lady
assheton
smiling
lead
on
fair
queen
she
continued
and
tell
your
companions
to
begin
their
sports
when
they
only
remember
this
that
we
shall
hope
to
see
all
your
gay
troop
this
evening
at
the
abbey
to
a
merry
dance
where
i
will
strive
to
find
her
majesty
a
suitable
partner
added
sir
ralph
stay
she
shall
make
her
choice
now
as
a
royal
personage
should
for
you
know
nell
a
queen
ever
chooseth
her
partner
whether
it
be
for
the
throne
or
for
the
brawl
how
gay
you
fair
one
shall
it
be
either
of
our
young
cousins
joe
or
will
robinson
of
raydale
or
our
cousin
who
still
thinketh
himself
young
squire
nicholas
of
downham
ay
let
it
be
me
i
implore
of
you
fair
queen
interposed
nicholas
he
is
engaged
already
observed
richard
assheton
coming
forward
i
heard
him
ask
pretty
mistress
tetlow
the
farmer
wife
to
dance
with
him
this
evening
at
the
abbey
a
loud
laugh
from
those
around
followed
this
piece
of
information
but
nicholas
was
in
no
wise
disconcerted
dick
would
have
her
choose
him
and
that
is
why
he
interferes
with
me
he
observed
how
say
you
fair
queen
shall
it
be
our
hopeful
cousin
i
will
answer
for
him
that
he
danceth
the
coranto
and
lavolta
indifferently
well
on
hearing
richard
assheton
voice
all
the
colour
had
forsaken
alizon
cheeks
but
at
this
direct
appeal
to
her
by
nicholas
it
returned
with
additional
force
and
the
change
did
not
escape
the
quick
eye
of
lady
assheton
you
perplex
her
cousin
nicholas
she
said
not
a
whit
eleanor
answered
the
squire
but
if
she
like
not
dick
assheton
there
is
another
dick
dick
sherburne
of
sladeburn
or
our
cousin
jack
braddyll
or
if
she
prefer
an
older
and
discreeter
man
there
is
father
greenacres
of
worston
or
master
roger
nowell
of
read
plenty
of
choice
nay
if
i
must
choose
a
partner
it
shall
be
a
young
one
said
alizon
right
fair
queen
right
cried
nicholas
laughing
ever
choose
a
young
man
if
you
can
who
shall
it
be
you
have
named
him
yourself
sir
replied
alizon
in
a
voice
which
she
endeavoured
to
keep
firm
but
which
in
spite
of
all
her
efforts
sounded
tremulously
master
richard
assheton
next
to
choosing
me
you
could
not
have
chosen
better
observed
nicholas
approvingly
dick
lad
i
congratulate
thee
i
congratulate
myself
replied
the
young
man
fair
queen
he
added
advancing
highly
flattered
am
i
by
your
choice
and
shall
so
demean
myself
i
trust
as
to
prove
myself
worthy
of
it
before
i
go
i
would
beg
a
boon
from
you
that
flower
this
pink
cried
alizon
it
is
yours
fair
sir
young
assheton
took
the
flower
and
took
the
hand
that
offered
it
at
the
same
time
and
pressed
the
latter
to
his
lips
while
lady
assheton
who
had
been
made
a
little
uneasy
by
alizon
apparent
emotion
and
who
with
true
feminine
tact
immediately
detected
its
cause
called
out
now
forward
forward
to
the
we
have
interrupted
the
revel
too
long
upon
this
the
may
queen
stepped
blushingly
back
with
the
usher
who
with
his
white
wand
in
hand
had
stood
bolt
upright
behind
her
immensely
delighted
with
the
scene
in
which
his
pupil
for
alizon
had
been
tutored
by
him
for
the
occasion
had
taken
part
sir
ralph
then
clapped
his
hands
loudly
and
at
this
signal
the
tabor
and
pipe
struck
up
the
fool
and
the
who
though
idle
all
the
time
had
indulged
in
a
little
quiet
fun
with
the
rustics
recommenced
their
gambols
the
their
lively
dance
and
the
whole
train
moved
towards
the
followed
by
the
with
all
its
bells
jingling
and
all
its
garlands
waving
as
to
alizon
her
brain
was
in
a
whirl
and
her
bosom
heaved
so
quickly
that
she
thought
she
should
faint
to
think
that
the
choice
of
a
partner
in
the
dance
at
the
abbey
had
been
offered
her
and
that
she
should
venture
to
choose
master
richard
assheton
she
could
scarcely
credit
her
own
temerity
and
then
to
think
that
she
should
give
him
a
flower
and
more
than
all
that
he
should
kiss
her
hand
in
return
for
it
she
felt
the
tingling
pressure
of
his
lips
upon
her
finger
still
and
her
little
heart
palpitated
strangely
as
she
approached
the
and
the
troop
again
halted
for
a
few
minutes
she
saw
her
brother
james
holding
little
jennet
by
the
hand
standing
in
the
front
line
to
look
at
her
oh
how
i
glad
to
see
you
here
jennet
she
cried
an
ey

alizon
replied
the
little
girl
jem

towd
me
whot

grand
partner

and
she
added
with
playful
malice
who
was
wrong
whon
she
said
the
queen
could
choose
master
richard
hush
jennet
not
a
word
more
interrupted
alizon
blushing
oh

replied
jennet
ey

a
present
for

cried
alizon
what
is

white

replied
the
little
girl
a
white
dove
where

it
let
me

cried
alizon
in
a
breath
here

replied
jennet
opening
her
kirtle
a
beautiful
bird

cried
alizon
take
care
of
it
for
me
till
i
come
home
which
winna
be
till
late
ey
fancy
rejoined
jennet
roguishly
ah
she
added
uttering
a
cry
the
latter
exclamation
was
occasioned
by
the
sudden
flight
of
the
dove
which
escaping
from
her
hold
soared
aloft
jennet
followed
the
course
of
its
silver
wings
as
they
cleaved
the
blue
sky
and
then
all
at
once
saw
a
large
hawk
which
apparently
had
been
hovering
about
swoop
down
upon
it
and
bear
it
off
some
white
feathers
fell
down
near
the
little
girl
and
she
picked
up
one
of
them
and
put
it
in
her
breast
poor
bird
exclaimed
the
may
queen
eigh
poor

echoed
jennet
tearfully

jem
replied
the
child
sadly
at
this
moment
the
music
which
had
ceased
while
some
arrangements
were
made
commenced
a
very
lively
tune
known
as
round
about
the
and
robin
hood
taking
the
may
queen
hand
led
her
towards
the
pole
and
placing
her
near
it
the
whole
of
her
attendants
took
hands
while
a
second
circle
was
formed
by
the
and
both
began
to
wheel
rapidly
round
her
the
music
momently
increasing
in
spirit
and
quickness
an
irresistible
desire
to
join
in
the
measure
seized
some
of
the
lads
and
lasses
around
and
they
likewise
took
hands
and
presently
a
third
and
still
wider
circle
was
formed
wheeling
gaily
round
the
other
two
other
dances
were
formed
here
and
there
and
presently
the
whole
green
was
in
movement
if
you
come
off
dick
i
shall
be
surprised
observed
nicholas
who
with
his
young
relative
had
approached
as
near
the
as
the
three
rounds
of
dancers
would
allow
them
richard
assheton
made
no
reply
but
glanced
at
the
pink
which
he
had
placed
in
his
doublet
who
is
the
may
queen
inquired
sir
thomas
metcalfe
who
had
likewise
drawn
near
of
a
tall
man
holding
a
little
girl
by
the
hand
alizon
dowter
of
elizabeth
device
an
mey
sister
replied
james
device
gruffly
humph
muttered
sir
thomas
she
is
a
lass
and
she
dwells
here
in
whalley
fellow
he
added
hoo

whalley
responded
jem
sullenly
i
can
easily
find

abode
muttered
the
knight
walking
away
what
was
it
sir
thomas
said
to
you
jem
inquired
nicholas
who
had
watched
the
knight
gestures
coming
up
jem
related
what
had
passed
between
them
what
the
devil
does
he
want
with
her
cried
nicholas
no
good
sure
but
i
spoil
his
sport
say
boh

squoire
an
break
every
boan
i
his
body
remarked
jem
no
no
jem
replied
nicholas
take
care
of
your
pretty
sister
and
i
take
care
of
him
at
this
juncture
sir
thomas
who
in
spite
of
the
efforts
of
the
pacific
master
potts
to
tranquillise
him
had
been
burning
with
wrath
at
the
affront
he
had
received
from
nicholas
came
up
to
richard
assheton
and
noticing
the
pink
in
his
bosom
snatched
it
away
suddenly
i
want
a
flower
he
said
smelling
at
it
instantly
restore
it
sir
thomas
cried
richard
assheton
pale
with
rage
or
what
will
you
do
young
sir
rejoined
the
knight
tauntingly
and
plucking
the
flower
in
pieces
you
can
get
another
from
the
fair
nymph
who
gave
you
this
further
speech
was
not
allowed
the
knight
for
he
received
a
violent
blow
on
the
chest
from
the
hand
of
richard
assheton
which
sent
him
reeling
backwards
and
would
have
felled
him
to
the
ground
if
he
had
not
been
caught
by
some
of
the
bystanders
the
moment
he
recovered
sir
thomas
drew
his
sword
and
furiously
assaulted
young
assheton
who
stood
ready
for
him
and
after
the
exchange
of
a
few
passes
for
none
of
the
bystanders
dared
to
interfere
sent
his
sword
whirling
over
their
heads
through
the
air
bravo
dick
cried
nicholas
stepping
up
and
clapping
his
cousin
on
the
back
you
have
read
him
a
good
lesson
and
taught
him
that
he
can
not
always
insult
folks
with
impunity
ha
ha
and
he
laughed
loudly
at
the
discomfited
knight
he
is
an
insolent
coward
said
richard
assheton
give
him
his
sword
and
let
him
come
on
again
no
no
said
nicholas
he
has
had
enough
this
time
and
if
he
has
not
he
must
settle
an
account
with
me
put
up
your
blade
lad
i
be
revenged
upon
you
both
said
sir
thomas
taking
his
sword
which
had
been
brought
him
by
a
bystander
and
stalking
away
you
leave
us
in
mortal
dread
doughty
knight
cried
nicholas
shouting
after
him
derisively
ha
ha
ha
richard
assheton
attention
was
however
turned
in
a
different
direction
for
the
music
suddenly
ceasing
and
the
dancers
stopping
he
learnt
that
the
may
queen
had
fainted
and
presently
afterwards
the
crowd
opened
to
give
passage
to
robin
hood
who
bore
her
inanimate
form

his

the
quarrel
between
nicholas
assheton
and
sir
thomas
metcalfe
had
already
been
made
known
to
sir
ralph
by
the
officious
master
potts
and
though
it
occasioned
the
knight
much
displeasure
as
interfering
with
the
amicable
arrangement
he
hoped
to
effect
with
sir
thomas
for
his
relatives
the
robinsons
still
he
felt
sure
that
he
had
sufficient
influence
with
his
cousin
the
squire
to
prevent
the
dispute
from
being
carried
further
and
he
only
waited
the
conclusion
of
the
sports
on
the
green
to
take
him
to
task
what
was
the
knight
surprise
and
annoyance
therefore
to
find
that
a
new
brawl
had
sprung
up
and
ignorant
of
its
precise
cause
he
laid
it
entirely
at
the
door
of
the
turbulent
nicholas
indeed
on
the
commencement
of
the
fray
he
imagined
that
the
squire
was
personally
concerned
in
it
and
full
of
wroth
flew
to
the
scene
of
action
but
before
he
got
there
the
affair
which
as
has
been
seen
was
of
short
duration
was
fully
settled
and
he
only
heard
the
jeers
addressed
to
the
retreating
combatant
by
nicholas
it
was
not
sir
ralph
way
to
vent
his
choler
in
words
but
the
squire
knew
in
an
instant
from
the
expression
of
his
countenance
that
he
was
greatly
incensed
and
therefore
hastened
to
explain
what
means
this
unseemly
disturbance
nicholas
cried
sir
ralph
not
allowing
the
other
to
speak
you
are
ever
brawling
like
an
alsatian
squire
independently
of
the
ill
example
set
to
these
good
folk
who
have
met
here
for
tranquil
amusement
you
have
counteracted
all
my
plans
for
the
adjustment
of
the
differences
between
sir
thomas
metcalfe
and
our
aunt
of
raydale
if
you
forget
what
is
due
to
yourself
sir
do
not
forget
what
is
due
to
me
and
to
the
name
you
bear
no
one
but
yourself
should
say
as
much
to
me
sir
ralph
rejoined
nicholas
somewhat
haughtily
but
you
are
under
a
misapprehension
it
is
not
i
who
have
been
fighting
though
i
should
have
acted
in
precisely
the
same
manner
as
our
cousin
dick
if
i
had
received
the
same
affront
and
so
i
make
bold
to
say
would
you
our
name
shall
suffer
no
discredit
from
me
and
as
a
gentleman
i
assert
that
sir
thomas
metcalfe
has
only
received
due
chastisement
as
you
yourself
will
admit
cousin
when
you
know
all
i
know
him
to
be
overbearing
observed
sir
ralph
overbearing
is
not
the
word
cousin
interrupted
nicholas
he
is
as
proud
as
a
peacock
and
would
trample
upon
us
all
and
gore
us
too
like
one
of
the
wild
bulls
of
bowland
if
we
would
let
him
have
his
way
but
i
would
treat
him
as
i
would
the
bull
aforesaid
a
wild
boar
or
any
other
savage
and
intractable
beast
hunt
him
down
and
poll
his
horns
or
pluck
out
his
tusks
come
come
nicholas
this
is
no
very
gentle
language
remarked
sir
ralph
why
to
speak
truth
cousin
i
do
not
feel
in
any
very
gentle
frame
of
mind
rejoined
the
squire
my
ire
has
been
roused
by
this
insolent
braggart
my
blood
is
up
and
i
long
to
be
doing
unchristian
feelings
nicholas
said
sir
ralph
severely
and
should
be
overcome
turn
the
other
cheek
to
the
smiter
i
trust
you
bear
no
malice
to
sir
thomas
i
bear
him
no
malice
for
i
hope
malice
is
not
in
my
nature
cousin
replied
nicholas
but
i
owe
him
a
grudge
and
when
a
fitting
opportunity
occurs
no
more
of
this
unless
you
would
really
incur
my
displeasure
rejoined
sir
ralph
the
matter
has
gone
far
enough
too
far
perhaps
for
amendment
and
if
you
know
it
not
i
can
tell
you
that
sir
claims
to
raydale
will
be
difficult
to
dispute
and
so
our
uncle
robinson
has
found
since
he
hath
taken
counsel
on
the
case
have
a
care
sir
ralph
said
nicholas
noticing
that
master
potts
was
approaching
them
with
his
ears
evidently
wide
open
there
is
that
little
london
lawyer
hovering
about
but
i
give
the
cunning
fox
a
double
i
glad
to
hear
you
say
so
sir
ralph
he
added
in
a
tone
calculated
to
reach
potts
and
since
our
uncle
robinson
is
so
sure
of
his
cause
it
may
be
better
to
let
this
blustering
knight
be
perchance
it
is
the
certainty
of
failure
that
makes
him
so
insensate
this
is
meant
to
blind
me
but
it
shall
not
serve
your
turn
cautelous
squire
muttered
potts
i
caught
enough
of
what
fell
just
now
from
sir
ralph
to
satisfy
me
that
he
hath
strong
misgivings
but
it
is
best
not
to
appear
too
ah
sir
ralph
he
added
coming
forward
i
was
right
you
see
in
my
caution
i
am
a
man
of
peace
and
strive
to
prevent
quarrels
and
bloodshed
quarrel
if
you
please
and
unfortunately
men
are
prone
to
anger
but
always
settle
your
disputes
in
a
court
of
law
always
in
a
court
of
law
sir
ralph
that
is
the
only
arena
where
a
sensible
man
should
ever
fight
take
good
advice
fee
your
counsel
well
and
the
chances
are
ten
to
one
in
your
favour
that
is
what
i
say
to
my
worthy
and
singular
good
client
sir
thomas
but
he
is
somewhat
headstrong
and
vehement
and
will
not
listen
to
me
he
is
for
settling
matters
by
the
sword
for
making
forcible
entries
and
detainers
and
ousting
the
tenants
in
possession
whereby
he
would
render
himself
liable
to
arrest
fine
ransom
and
forfeiture
instead
of
proceeding
cautiously
and
decorously
as
the
law
directs
and
as
i
advise
sir
ralph
by
writ
of
or
action
of
trespass
the
which
would
assuredly
establish
his
title
and
restore
him
the
house
and
lands
or
he
may
proceed
by
writ
of
right
which
perhaps
in
his
case
considering
the
long
absence
of
possession
and
the
doubts
supposed
to
perplex
the
title
though
i
myself
have
no
doubts
about
it
would
be
the
most
efficacious
these
are
your
only
true
weapons
sir
ralph
your
writs
of
entry
assise
and
right
your
pleas
of
novel
disseisin
and
your
remitters
your
præcipes
your
pones
and
your
recordari
faciases
these
are
the
sword
shield
and
armour
of
proof
of
a
wise
man
zounds
you
take
away
one
breath
with
this
of
writs
and
pleas
master
lawyer
cried
nicholas
but
in
one
respect
i
am
of
your
and
singular
good
client
opinion
and
would
rather
trust
to
my
own
hand
for
the
defence
of
my
property
than
to
the
law
to
keep
it
for
me
then
you
would
do
wrong
good
master
nicholas
rejoined
potts
with
a
smile
of
supreme
contempt
for
the
law
is
the
better
guardian
and
the
stronger
adversary
of
the
two
and
so
sir
thomas
will
find
if
he
takes
my
advice
and
obtains
as
he
can
and
will
do
a
perfect
title
et
seisinæ
sir
thomas
is
still
willing
to
refer
the
case
to
my
arbitrament
i
believe
sir
demanded
sir
ralph
uneasily
he
was
so
sir
ralph
rejoined
potts
unless
the
assaults
and
batteries
with
intent
to
do
him
grievous
corporeal
hurt
which
he
hath
sustained
from
your
relatives
have
induced
a
change
of
mind
in
him
but
as
i
premised
sir
ralph
i
am
a
man
of
peace
and
willing
to
intermediate
provided
you
get
your
fee
master
lawyer
observed
nicholas
sarcastically
certainly
i
object
not
to
the
master
nicholas
rejoined
potts
and
if
my
client
hath
the
pro
and
gaineth
his
point
he
can
not
but
what
is
this
some
fresh
disturbance
something
hath
happened
to
the
may
queen
cried
nicholas
i
trust
not
said
sir
ralph
with
real
concern
ha
she
has
fainted
they
are
bringing
her
this
way
poor
maid
what
can
have
occasioned
this
sudden
seizure
i
think
i
could
give
a
guess
muttered
nicholas
better
remove
her
to
the
abbey
he
added
aloud
to
the
knight
you
are
right
said
sir
ralph
our
cousin
dick
is
near
her
i
observe
he
shall
see
her
conveyed
there
at
once
at
this
moment
lady
assheton
and
nutter
with
some
of
the
other
ladies
came
up
just
in
time
nell
cried
the
knight
have
you
your
about
you
the
may
queen
has
fainted
indeed
exclaimed
lady
assheton
springing
towards
alizon
who
was
now
sustained
by
young
richard
assheton
the
forester
having
surrendered
her
to
him
how
has
this
happened
she
inquired
giving
her
to
breathe
at
a
small
phial
that
i
can
not
tell
you
cousin
replied
richard
assheton
unless
from
some
sudden
fright
that
was
it
master
richard
cried
robin
hood
she
cried
out
on
hearing
the
clashing
of
swords
just
now
and
i
think
pronounced
your
name
on
finding
you
engaged
with
sir
thomas
and
immediately
after
turned
pale
and
would
have
fallen
if
i
had
not
caught
her
ah
indeed
exclaimed
lady
assheton
glancing
at
richard
whose
eyes
fell
before
her
inquiring
gaze
but
see
she
revives
pursued
the
lady
let
me
support
her
head
as
she
spoke
alizon
opened
her
eyes
and
perceiving
richard
assheton
who
had
relinquished
her
to
his
relative
standing
beside
her
she
exclaimed
oh
you
are
safe
i
feared
and
then
she
stopped
greatly
embarrassed
you
feared
he
might
be
in
danger
from
his
fierce
adversary
supplied
lady
assheton
but
no
the
conflict
is
happily
over
and
he
is
unhurt
i
am
glad
of
it
said
alizon
earnestly
she
had
better
be
taken
to
the
abbey
remarked
sir
ralph
coming
up
nay
she
will
be
more
at
ease
at
home
observed
lady
assheton
with
a
significant
look
which
however
failed
in
reaching
her
husband
yes
truly
shall
i
gracious
lady
replied
alizon
far
more
so
i
have
given
you
trouble
enough
already
no
trouble
at
all
said
sir
ralph
kindly
her
ladyship
is
too
happy
to
be
of
service
in
a
case
like
this
are
you
not
nell
the
faintness
will
pass
off
presently
but
let
her
go
to
the
abbey
at
once
and
remain
there
till
the
evening
festivities
in
which
she
takes
part
commence
give
her
your
arm
dick
sir
ralph
word
was
law
and
therefore
lady
assheton
made
no
remonstrance
but
she
said
quickly
i
will
take
care
of
her
myself
i
require
no
assistance
madam
replied
alizon
since
sir
ralph
will
have
me
go
nay
you
are
too
kind
too
condescending
she
added
reluctantly
taking
lady
assheton
proffered
arm
and
in
this
way
they
proceeded
slowly
towards
the
abbey
escorted
by
richard
assheton
and
attended
by
mistress
braddyll
and
some
others
of
the
ladies
amongst
those
who
had
watched
the
progress
of
the
may
restoration
with
most
interest
was
mistress
nutter
though
she
had
not
interfered
and
as
alizon
departed
with
lady
assheton
she
observed
to
nicholas
who
was
standing
near
can
this
be
the
daughter
of
elizabeth
device
and
of
your
old
pendle
witch
mother
demdike
supplied
nicholas
the
very
same
i
assure
you
mistress
nutter
she
is
wholly
unlike
the
family
observed
the
lady
and
her
features
resemble
some
i
have
seen
before
she
does
not
resemble
her
mother
undoubtedly
replied
nicholas
though
what
her
may
have
been
some
sixty
years
ago
when
she
was
alizon
age
it
would
be
difficult
to
she
is
no
beauty
now
those
finely
modelled
features
that
graceful
figure
and
those
delicate
hands
can
not
surely
belong
to
one
lowly
born
and
bred
said
mistress
nutter
they
differ
from
the
ordinary
peasant
mould
truly
replied
nicholas
if
you
ask
me
for
the
lineage
of
a
steed
i
can
give
a
guess
at
it
on
sight
of
the
animal
but
as
regards
our
own
race
i
at
fault
mistress
nutter
i
must
question
elizabeth
device
about
her
observed
alice
strange
i
should
never
have
seen
her
before
though
i
know
the
family
so
well
i
wish
you
did
not
know
mother
demdike
quite
so
well
mistress
nutter
remarked
nicholas
a
mischievous
and
malignant
old
witch
who
deserves
the
tar
barrel
the
only
marvel
is
that
she
has
not
been
burned
long
ago
i
am
of
opinion
with
many
others
that
it
was
she
who
bewitched
your
poor
husband
richard
nutter
i
do
not
think
it
replied
mistress
nutter
with
a
mournful
shake
of
the
head
alas
poor
man
he
died
from
hard
riding
after
hard
drinking
that
was
the
only
witchcraft
in
his
case
be
warned
by
his
fate
yourself
nicholas
hard
riding
after
drinking
was
more
likely
to
sober
him
than
to
kill
him
rejoined
the
squire
but
as
i
said
just
now
i
like
not
this
mother
demdike
nor
her
rival
in
iniquity
old
mother
chattox
the
devil
only
knows
which
of
the
two
is
worst
but
if
the
former
hag
did
not
bewitch
your
husband
to
death
as
i
shrewdly
suspect
it
is
certain
that
the
latter
mumbling
old
miscreant
killed
my
elder
brother
richard
by
her
sorceries
mother
chattox
did
you
a
good
turn
then
nicholas
observed
mistress
nutter
in
making
you
master
of
the
fair
estates
of
downham
so
far
perhaps
she
might
rejoined
nicholas
but
i
do
not
like
the
manner
of
it
and
would
gladly
see
her
burned
nay
i
would
fire
the
fagots
myself
you
are
superstitious
as
the
rest
nicholas
said
mistress
nutter
for
my
part
i
do
not
believe
in
the
existence
of
witches
not
believe
in
witches
with
these
two
living
proofs
to
the
contrary
cried
nicholas
in
amazement
why
pendle
forest
swarms
with
witches
they
burrow
in
the
like
rabbits
in
a
warren
they
are
the
terror
of
the
whole
country
no
man
cattle
goods
nor
even
life
are
safe
from
them
and
the
only
reason
why
these
two
old
hags
who
hold
sovereign
sway
over
the
others
have
justice
so
long
is
because
every
one
is
afraid
to
go
near
them
their
solitary
habitations
are
more
strongly
guarded
than
fortresses
not
believe
in
witches
why
i
should
as
soon
misdoubt
the
holy
scriptures
it
may
be
because
i
reside
near
them
that
i
have
so
little
apprehension
or
rather
no
apprehension
at
all
replied
mistress
nutter
but
to
me
mother
demdike
and
mother
chattox
appear
two
harmless
old
women
they
a
couple
of
dangerous
and
damnable
old
hags
and
deserve
the
stake
cried
nicholas
emphatically
all
this
discourse
had
been
swallowed
with
greedy
ears
by
the
master
potts
who
had
approached
the
speakers
unperceived
and
he
now
threw
in
a
word
so
there
are
suspected
witches
in
pendle
forest
i
find
he
said
i
shall
make
it
my
business
to
institute
inquiries
concerning
them
when
i
visit
the
place
even
if
merely
they
must
be
examined
and
if
found
innocent
cleared
if
not
punished
according
to
the
statute
our
sovereign
lord
the
king
holdeth
witches
in
especial
abhorrence
and
would
gladly
see
all
such
noxious
vermin
extirpated
from
the
land
and
it
will
rejoice
me
to
promote
his
laudable
designs
i
must
pray
you
to
afford
me
all
the
assistance
you
can
in
the
discovery
of
these
dreadful
delinquents
good
master
nicholas
and
i
will
care
that
your
services
are
duly
represented
in
the
proper
quarter
as
i
have
just
said
the
king
taketh
singular
interest
in
witchcraft
as
you
may
judge
if
the
learned
tractate
he
hath
put
forth
in
form
of
a
dialogue
intituled
hath
ever
met
your
eye
and
he
is
never
so
well
pleased
as
when
the
truth
of
his
tenets
are
proved
by
such
secret
offenders
being
brought
to
light
and
duly
punished
the
king
known
superstitious
dread
of
witches
makes
men
seek
them
out
to
win
his
favour
observed
mistress
nutter
they
have
wonderfully
increased
since
the
publication
of
that
baneful
book
not
so
madam
replied
potts
our
sovereign
lord
the
king
hath
a
wholesome
and
just
hatred
of
such
and
traitors
to
himself
and
heaven
and
it
may
be
dread
of
them
as
indeed
all
good
men
must
have
but
he
would
protect
his
subjects
from
them
and
therefore
in
the
first
year
of
his
reign
which
i
trust
will
be
long
and
prosperous
he
hath
passed
a
statute
whereby
it
is
enacted
all
persons
invoking
any
evil
spirit
or
consulting
covenanting
with
entertaining
employing
feeding
or
rewarding
any
evil
spirit
or
taking
up
dead
bodies
from
their
graves
to
be
used
in
any
witchcraft
sorcery
charm
or
enchantment
or
killing
or
otherwise
hurting
any
person
by
such
infernal
arts
shall
be
guilty
of
felony
without
benefit
of
clergy
and
suffer
death
this
statute
madam
was
intended
to
check
the
crimes
of
necromancy
sorcery
and
witchcraft
and
not
to
increase
them
and
i
maintain
that
it
has
checked
them
and
will
continue
to
check
them
it
is
a
wicked
and
bloody
statute
observed
nutter
in
a
deep
tone
and
many
an
innocent
life
will
be
sacrificed
thereby
how
madam
cried
master
potts
staring
aghast
do
you
mean
to
impugn
the
sagacity
and
justice
of
our
high
and
mighty
king
the
head
of
the
law
and
defender
of
the
faith
i
affirm
that
this
is
a
sanguinary
enactment
replied
mistress
nutter
and
will
put
power
into
hands
that
will
abuse
it
and
destroy
many
guiltless
persons
it
will
make
more
witches
than
it
will
find
some
are
ready
made
methinks
muttered
potts
and
we
need
not
go
far
to
find
them
you
are
a
zealous
advocate
for
witches
i
must
say
madam
he
added
aloud
and
i
shall
not
forget
your
arguments
in
their
favour
to
my
prejudice
i
doubt
not
she
rejoined
bitterly
no
to
the
credit
of
your
humanity
he
answered
bowing
with
pretended
conviction
well
i
will
aid
you
in
your
search
for
witches
master
potts
observed
nicholas
for
i
would
gladly
see
the
country
rid
of
these
pests
but
i
warn
you
the
quest
will
be
attended
with
risk
and
you
will
get
few
to
accompany
you
for
all
the
folk
hereabouts
are
mortally
afraid
of
these
terrible
old
hags
i
fear
nothing
in
the
discharge
of
my
duty
replied
master
potts
courageously
for
as
our
high
and
mighty
sovereign
hath
well
and
learnedly
observed
witches
be
but
apprehended
and
detained
by
any
private
person
upon
other
private
respects
their
power
no
doubt
either
in
escaping
or
in
doing
hurt
is
no
less
than
ever
it
was
before
but
if
on
the
other
part
their
apprehending
and
detention
be
by
the
lawful
magistrate
upon
the
just
respect
of
their
guiltiness
in
that
craft
their
power
is
then
no
greater
than
before
that
ever
they
meddled
with
their
master
for
where
god
begins
justly
to
strike
by
his
lawful
lieutenants
it
is
not
in
the
devil
power
to
defraud
or
bereave
him
of
the
office
or
effect
of
his
powerful
and
revenging
sceptre
thus
i
am
safe
and
i
shall
take
care
to
go
armed
with
a
proper
warrant
which
i
shall
obtain
from
a
magistrate
my
honoured
friend
and
singular
good
client
master
roger
newell
this
will
obtain
me
such
assistance
as
i
may
require
and
for
due
observance
of
my
authority
i
shall
likewise
take
with
me
a
or
constable
you
will
do
well
master
potts
said
nicholas
still
you
must
not
put
faith
in
all
the
idle
tales
told
you
for
the
common
folk
hereabouts
are
blindly
and
foolishly
superstitious
and
fancy
they
discern
witchcraft
in
every
mischance
however
slight
that
befalls
them
if
ale
turn
sour
after
a
the
witch
hath
done
it
and
if
the
butter
cometh
not
quickly
she
hindereth
it
if
the
meat
roast
ill
the
witch
hath
turned
the
spit
and
if
the
lumber
pie
taste
ill
she
hath
had
a
finger
in
it
if
your
sheep
have
the
your
horses
the
staggers
or
your
swine
the
measles
your
hounds
a
surfeit
or
your
cow
slippeth
her
calf
the
witch
is
at
the
bottom
of
it
all
if
your
maid
hath
a
fit
of
the
sullens
or
doeth
her
work
amiss
or
your
man
breaketh
a
dish
the
witch
is
in
fault
and
her
shoulders
can
bear
the
blame
on
this
very
day
of
the
year
namely
may
day
the
foolish
folk
hold
any
aged
crone
who
fetcheth
fire
to
be
a
witch
and
if
they
catch
a
among
their
cattle
they
will
instantly
beat
it
to
death
with
sticks
concluding
it
to
be
an
old
hag
in
that
form
come
to
dry
up
the
milk
of
their
kine
these
are
what
master
potts
royal
authority
would
style
old
wives
trattles
about
the
fire
observed
mistress
nutter
scornfully
better
be
than
replied
potts
even
at
my
lodging
in
chancery
lane
i
have
a
horseshoe
nailed
against
the
door
one
can
not
be
too
cautious
when
one
has
to
fight
against
the
devil
or
those
in
league
with
him
your
witch
should
be
put
to
every
ordeal
she
should
be
scratched
with
pins
to
draw
blood
from
her
weighed
against
the
church
bible
though
this
is
not
always
proof
forced
to
weep
for
a
witch
can
only
shed
three
tears
and
those
only
from
the
left
eye
or
as
our
sovereign
lord
the
king
truly
observeth
no
offence
to
you
mistress
nutter
so
much
as
their
eyes
are
able
to
shed
tears
albeit
the
womenkind
especially
be
able
otherwise
to
shed
tears
at
every
light
occasion
when
they
will
yea
although
it
were
dissemblingly
like
the
crocodile
and
set
on
a
stool
for
hours
with
her
legs
tied
across
and
suffered
neither
to
eat
drink
nor
sleep
during
the
time
this
is
the
surest
way
to
make
her
confess
her
guilt
next
to
swimming
if
it
fails
then
cast
her
with
her
thumbs
and
toes
tied
across
into
a
pond
and
if
she
sink
not
then
is
she
certainly
a
witch
other
trials
there
are
as
that
by
scalding
water
sticking
knives
across
heating
of
the
horseshoe
tying
of
knots
the
sieve
and
the
shears
but
the
only
ordeals
safely
to
be
relied
on
are
the
swimming
and
the
stool
before
mentioned
and
from
these
your
witch
shall
rarely
escape
above
all
be
sure
and
search
carefully
for
the
i
doubt
not
we
shall
find
it
fairly
and
legibly
writ
in
the
characters
on
mother
demdike
and
mother
chattox
they
shall
undergo
the
stool
and
the
pool
and
other
trials
if
required
these
old
hags
shall
no
longer
vex
you
good
master
nicholas
leave
them
to
me
and
doubt
not
i
will
bring
them
to
condign
punishment
you
will
do
us
good
service
then
master
potts
replied
nicholas
but
since
you
are
so
learned
in
the
matter
of
witchcraft
resolve
me
i
pray
you
how
it
is
that
women
are
so
much
more
addicted
to
the
practice
of
the
black
art
than
our
own
sex
the
answer
to
the
inquiry
hath
been
given
by
our
british
solomon
replied
potts
and
i
will
deliver
it
to
you
in
his
own
words
reason
is
easy
he
saith
as
that
sex
is
frailer
than
man
is
so
it
is
easier
to
be
entrapped
in
those
gross
snares
of
the
devil
as
was
overwell
proved
to
be
true
by
the
serpent
deceiving
of
eva
at
the
beginning
which
makes
him
the
homelier
with
that
sex
sensine
a
good
and
sufficient
reason
master
potts
said
nicholas
laughing
is
it
not
so
mistress
nutter
ay
marry
if
it
satisfies
you
she
answered
drily
it
is
of
a
piece
with
the
rest
of
the
reasoning
of
the
royal
pedant
whom
master
potts
styles
the
british
solomon
i
only
give
the
learned
monarch
the
title
by
which
he
is
recognised
throughout
christendom
rejoined
potts
sharply
well
there
is
comfort
in
the
thought
that
i
shall
never
be
taken
for
a
wizard
said
the
squire
be
not
too
sure
of
that
good
master
nicholas
returned
potts
our
present
prince
seems
to
have
had
you
in
his
eye
when
he
penned
his
description
of
a
wizard
for
he
saith
great
number
of
them
that
ever
have
been
convict
or
confessors
of
witchcraft
as
may
be
presently
seen
by
many
that
have
at
this
time
confessed
are
some
of
them
rich
and
some
of
them
fat
or
corpulent
in
their
bodies
and
most
part
of
them
altogether
given
over
to
the
pleasures
of
the
flesh
continual
haunting
of
company
and
all
kinds
of
merriness
lawful
and
unlawful
this
hitteth
you
exactly
master
nicholas
zounds
exclaimed
the
squire
if
this
be
exact
it
toucheth
me
too
nearly
to
be
altogether
agreeable
the
passage
is
truly
quoted
nicholas
observed
mistress
nutter
with
a
cold
smile
i
perfectly
remember
it
master
potts
seems
to
have
the
at
his
fingers
ends
i
have
made
it
my
study
madam
replied
the
lawyer
somewhat
mollified
by
the
remark
as
i
have
the
statute
on
witchcraft
and
indeed
most
other
statutes
we
have
wasted
time
enough
in
this
unprofitable
talk
said
mistress
nutter
abruptly
quitting
them
without
bestowing
the
slightest
salutation
on
potts
i
was
but
jesting
in
what
i
said
just
now
good
master
nicholas
observed
the
little
lawyer
nowise
disconcerted
at
the
slight
though
they
were
the
king
exact
words
i
quoted
no
one
would
suspect
you
of
being
a
wizard
ha
ha
but
i
am
resolved
to
prosecute
the
search
and
i
calculate
upon
your
aid
and
that
of
master
richard
assheton
who
goes
with
us
you
shall
have
mine
at
all
events
master
potts
replied
nicholas
and
i
doubt
not
my
cousin
dick
too
our
may
queen
alizon
device
is
mother
demdike
is
she
not
asked
potts
after
a
moment
reflection
ay
why
do
you
ask
demanded
nicholas
for
a
good
and
sufficing
reason
replied
potts
she
might
be
an
important
witness
for
as
king
james
saith
or
wives
may
of
our
law
serve
for
sufficient
witnesses
and
proofs
and
he
goeth
on
to
say
who
but
witches
can
be
proofs
and
so
witnesses
of
the
doings
of
witches
you
do
not
mean
to
aver
that
alizon
device
is
a
witch
sir
cried
nicholas
sharply
i
aver
nothing
replied
potts
but
as
a
relative
of
a
suspected
witch
she
will
be
the
best
witness
against
her
if
you
design
to
meddle
with
alizon
device
expect
no
assistance
from
me
master
potts
said
nicholas
sternly
but
rather
the
contrary
nay
i
but
threw
out
the
hint
good
master
nicholas
replied
potts
another
witness
will
do
equally
well
there
are
other
children
no
doubt
i
rely
on
you
sir
i
rely
on
you
i
shall
now
go
in
search
of
master
nowell
and
obtain
the
warrant
and
the
constable
and
i
shall
go
keep
my
appointment
with
parson
dewhurst
at
the
abbey
said
nicholas
bowing
slightly
to
the
attorney
and
taking
his
departure
it
will
not
do
to
alarm
him
at
present
said
potts
looking
after
him
but
i
have
that
girl
as
a
witness
and
i
know
how
to
terrify
her
into
compliance
a
singular
woman
that
mistress
alice
nutter
i
must
inquire
into
her
history
odd
how
obstinately
she
set
her
face
against
witchcraft
and
yet
she
lives
at
rough
lee
in
the
very
heart
of
a
witch
district
for
such
master
nicholas
assheton
calls
this
pendle
forest
i
should
wonder
if
she
has
dealings
with
the
old
hags
she
defends
mother
demdike
and
mother
chattox
chattox
lord
bless
us
what
a
name
there
caldron
and
broomstick
in
the
very
sound
and
demdike
is
little
better
both
seem
of
diabolical
invention
if
i
can
unearth
a
pack
of
witches
i
shall
gain
much
credit
from
my
honourable
good
lords
the
judges
of
assize
in
these
northern
parts
besides
pleasing
the
king
himself
who
is
sure
to
hear
of
it
and
reward
my
praiseworthy
zeal
look
to
yourself
mistress
nutter
and
take
care
you
are
not
caught
tripping
and
now
for
master
roger
nowell
with
this
he
peered
about
among
the
crowd
in
search
of
the
magistrate
but
though
he
thrust
his
little
nose
in
every
direction
he
could
not
find
him
and
therefore
set
out
for
the
abbey
concluding
he
had
gone
thither
as
mistress
nutter
walked
along
she
perceived
james
device
among
the
crowd
holding
jennet
by
the
hand
and
motioned
him
to
come
to
her
jem
instantly
understood
the
sign
and
quitting
his
little
sister
drew
near
tell
thy
mother
said
mistress
nutter
in
a
tone
calculated
only
for
his
hearing
to
come
to
me
at
the
abbey
quickly
and
secretly
i
shall
be
in
the
ruins
of
the
old
convent
church
i
have
somewhat
to
say
to
her
that
concerns
herself
as
well
as
me
thou
wilt
have
to
go
to
rough
lee
and
malkin
tower
jem
nodded
to
show
his
perfect
apprehension
of
what
was
said
and
his
assent
to
it
and
while
mistress
nutter
moved
on
with
a
slow
and
dignified
step
he
returned
to
jennet
and
told
her
she
must
go
home
directly
a
piece
of
intelligence
which
was
not
received
very
graciously
by
the
little
maiden
but
nothing
heeding
her
unwillingness
jem
walked
her
off
quickly
in
the
direction
of
the
cottage
but
while
on
the
way
to
it
they
accidentally
encountered
their
mother
elizabeth
device
and
therefore
stopped
yo
mun

up
to
th

said
jem
with
a

as

and

pursued
their

elizabeth
hobbled
off
towards
the
abbey

as
she

and
muttering
in

way
she
passed
through
the
abbey
gateway
the
wicket
being
left
open
and
proceeded
towards
the
ruinous
convent
church
taking
care
as
much
as
possible
to
avoid
observation
chapter
mother
chattox
not
far
from
the
green
where
the
revels
were
held
stood
the
ancient
parish
church
of
whalley
its
square
tower
surmounted
with
a
and
banner
and
shaking
with
the
joyous
peals
of
the
ringers
a
picturesque
and
beautiful
structure
it
was
though
full
of
architectural
incongruities
and
its
grey
walls
and
hoary
buttresses
with
the
windows
of
the
choir
and
the
ramified
tracery
of
the
fine
eastern
window
could
not
fail
to
please
any
taste
not
quite
so
critical
as
to
require
absolute
harmony
and
perfection
in
a
building
parts
of
the
venerable
fabric
were
older
than
the
abbey
itself
dating
back
as
far
as
the
eleventh
century
when
a
chapel
occupied
the
site
and
though
many
alterations
had
been
made
in
the
subsequent
structure
at
various
times
and
many
beauties
destroyed
especially
during
the
period
of
the
reformation
enough
of
its
pristine
character
remained
to
render
it
a
very
good
specimen
of
an
old
country
church
internally
the
cylindrical
columns
of
the
north
aisle
the
construction
of
the
choir
and
the
three
stone
seats
supported
on
rounded
columns
near
the
altar
proclaimed
its
high
antiquity
within
the
choir
were
preserved
the
eighteen
stalls
once
occupying
a
similar
position
in
the
desecrated
conventual
church
and
though
exquisite
in
themselves
they
seemed
here
sadly
out
of
place
not
being
proportionate
to
the
structure
their
seats
projected
far
into
the
body
of
the
church
and
their
crocketed
pinnacles
shot
up
almost
to
the
ceiling
but
it
was
well
they
had
not
shared
the
destruction
in
which
almost
all
the
other
ornaments
of
the
magnificent
fane
they
once
decorated
were
involved
carefully
preserved
the
black
varnished
oak
well
displayed
the
quaint
and
grotesque
designs
with
which
many
of
them
the
stall
in
especial
were
embellished
chief
among
them
was
the
stall
festooned
with
sculptured
vine
wreaths
and
clustering
grapes
and
bearing
the
auspicious
inscription
semper
gaudentes
sint
ista
sede
sedentes
singularly
inapplicable
however
to
the
last
prelate
who
filled
it
some
fine
old
monuments
and
warlike
trophies
of
neighbouring
wealthy
families
adorned
the
walls
and
within
the
nave
was
a
magnificent
pew
with
a
canopy
and
pillars
of
oak
and
at
the
sides
allotted
to
the
manor
of
read
and
recently
erected
by
roger
nowell
while
in
the
north
and
south
aisles
were
two
small
chapels
converted
since
the
reformed
faith
had
obtained
into
pews
the
one
called
saint
mary
cage
belonging
to
the
assheton
family
and
the
other
appertaining
to
the
catterals
of
little
mitton
and
designated
saint
nicholas
cage
under
the
chapel
were
interred
some
of
the
paslews
of
wiswall
and
here
lay
the
last
unfortunate
abbot
of
whalley
between
whoso
grave
and
the
assheton
and
braddyll
families
a
fatal
relation
was
supposed
to
subsist
another
large
pew
allotted
to
the
towneleys
and
designated
saint
anthony
cage
was
rendered
remarkable
by
a
characteristic
speech
of
sir
john
towneley
which
gave
much
offence
to
the
neighbouring
dames
called
upon
to
decide
as
to
the
position
of
the
sittings
in
the
church
the
discourteous
knight
made
choice
of
saint
anthony
cage
already
mentioned
declaring
my
man
shuttleworth
of
hacking
made
this
form
and
here
will
i
sit
when
i
come
and
my
cousin
nowell
may
make
a
seat
behind
me
if
he
please
and
my
son
sherburne
shall
make
one
on
the
other
side
and
master
catteral
another
behind
him
and
for
the
residue
the
use
shall
be
first
come
first
speed
and
that
will
make
the
proud
wives
of
whalley
rise
betimes
to
come
to
church
one
can
fancy
the
rough
knight
chuckle
as
he
addressed
these
words
to
the
old
clerk
certain
of
their
being
quickly
repeated
to
the
proud
wives
in
question
within
the
churchyard
grew
two
fine
old
now
long
since
decayed
and
gone
but
then
spreading
their
arms
over
the
little
graves
reared
against
the
buttresses
of
the
church
was
an
old
stone
coffin
together
with
a
fragment
of
a
curious
monumental
effigy
likewise
of
stone
but
the
most
striking
objects
in
the
place
and
deservedly
ranked
amongst
the
wonders
of
whalley
were
three
remarkable
crosses
set
in
a
line
upon
pedestals
covered
with
singular
devices
in
fretwork
and
all
three
differing
in
size
and
design
evidently
of
remotest
antiquity
these
crosses
were
traditionally
assigned
to
paullinus
who
according
to
the
venerable
bede
first
preached
the
gospel
in
these
parts
in
the
early
part
of
the
seventh
century
but
other
legends
were
attached
to
them
by
the
vulgar
and
dim
mystery
brooded
over
them
vestiges
of
another
people
and
another
faith
were
likewise
here
discernible
for
where
the
saxon
forefathers
of
the
village
prayed
and
slumbered
in
death
the
roman
invaders
of
the
isle
had
trodden
and
perchance
performed
their
religious
rites
some
traces
of
an
encampment
being
found
in
the
churchyard
by
the
historian
of
the
spot
while
the
north
boundary
of
the
hallowed
precincts
was
formed
by
a
deep
foss
once
encompassing
the
fortification
besides
these
records
of
an
elder
people
there
was
another
memento
of
bygone
days
and
creeds
in
a
little
hermitage
and
chapel
adjoining
it
founded
in
the
reign
of
edward
by
henry
duke
of
lancaster
for
the
support
of
two
recluses
and
a
priest
to
say
masses
daily
for
him
and
his
descendants
but
this
pious
bequest
being
grievously
abused
in
the
subsequent
reign
of
henry
by
isole
de
heton
a
fair
widow
who
in
the
first
transports
of
grief
vowing
herself
to
heaven
took
up
her
abode
in
the
hermitage
and
led
a
very
disorderly
life
therein
to
the
great
scandal
of
the
abbey
and
the
great
prejudice
of
the
morals
of
its
brethren
and
at
last
tired
even
of
the
slight
restraint
imposed
upon
her
fled
away
contrary
to
her
oath
and
profession
not
willing
nor
intending
to
be
restored
again
the
hermitage
was
dissolved
by
the
pious
monarch
and
masses
ordered
to
be
said
daily
in
the
parish
church
for
the
repose
of
the
soul
of
the
founder
such
was
the
legend
attached
to
the
little
cell
and
tradition
went
on
to
say
that
the
anchoress
broke
her
leg
in
crossing
whalley
nab
and
limped
ever
afterwards
a
just
judgment
on
such
a
heinous
offender
both
these
little
structures
were
picturesque
objects
being
overgrown
with
ivy
and
woodbine
the
chapel
was
completely
in
ruins
while
the
cell
profaned
by
the
misdoings
of
the
dissolute
votaress
isole
had
been
converted
into
a
cage
for
vagrants
and
offenders
and
made
secure
by
a
grated
window
and
a
strong
door
studded
with
nails
the
view
from
the
churchyard
embracing
the
a
comfortable
residence
surrounded
by
a
large
garden
well
stocked
with
and
sheltered
by
a
fine
grove
of
timber
extended
on
the
one
hand
over
the
village
and
on
the
other
over
the
abbey
and
was
bounded
by
the
towering
and
heights
of
whalley
nab
on
the
side
of
the
abbey
the
most
conspicuous
objects
were
the
great
gateway
with
the
ruined
conventual
church
ever
beautiful
the
view
was
especially
so
on
the
present
occasion
from
the
animated
scene
combined
with
it
and
the
pleasant
prospect
was
enjoyed
by
a
large
assemblage
who
had
adjourned
thither
to
witness
the
concluding
part
of
the
festival
within
the
green
and
bowers
which
as
has
before
been
mentioned
were
erected
in
the
churchyard
were
seated
doctor
ormerod
and
sir
ralph
assheton
with
such
of
their
respective
guests
as
had
not
already
retired
including
richard
and
nicholas
assheton
both
of
whom
had
returned
from
the
abbey
the
former
having
been
dismissed
by
lady
assheton
from
further
attendance
upon
alizon
and
the
latter
having
concluded
his
discourse
with
parson
dewhurst
who
indeed
accompanied
him
to
the
church
and
was
now
placed
between
the
vicar
and
the
rector
of
middleton
from
this
gentle
elevation
the
gay
company
on
the
green
could
be
fully
discerned
the
tall
with
its
garlands
and
ribands
forming
a
pivot
about
which
the
throng
ever
revolved
while
stationary
amidst
the
moving
masses
the
reared
on
high
its
broad
green
back
as
if
to
resist
the
living
waves
constantly
dashed
against
it
a
new
kind
of
movement
was
perceptible
and
it
soon
became
evident
that
a
procession
was
being
formed
immediately
afterwards
the
was
put
in
motion
and
winded
slowly
along
the
narrow
street
leading
to
the
church
preceded
by
the
and
the
other
revellers
and
followed
by
a
great
concourse
of
people
shouting
dancing
and
singing
on
came
the
crowd
the
jingling
of
bells
and
the
sound
of
music
grew
louder
and
louder
and
the
procession
lost
for
awhile
behind
some
intervening
habitations
though
the
men
bestriding
the
could
be
discerned
over
their
summits
burst
suddenly
into
view
and
the
revellers
entering
the
churchyard
drew
up
on
either
side
of
the
little
path
leading
to
the
porch
while
the
coming
up
the
next
moment
stopped
at
the
gate
then
four
young
maidens
dressed
in
white
and
having
baskets
in
their
hands
advanced
and
scattered
flowers
along
the
path
after
which
ladders
were
reared
against
the
sides
of
the
and
the
men
descending
from
their
exalted
position
bore
the
garlands
to
the
church
preceded
by
the
vicar
and
the
two
other
divines
and
followed
by
robin
hood
and
his
band
the
and
a
troop
of
little
children
singing
a
hymn
the
next
step
was
to
unfasten
the
bundles
of
rushes
of
which
the
cart
was
composed
and
this
was
very
quickly
and
skilfully
performed
the
utmost
care
being
taken
of
the
trinkets
and
valuables
with
which
it
was
ornamented
these
were
gathered
together
in
baskets
and
conveyed
to
the
vestry
and
there
locked
up
this
done
the
bundles
of
rushes
were
taken
up
by
several
old
women
who
strewed
the
aisles
with
them
and
placed
such
as
had
been
tied
up
as
mats
in
the
pews
at
the
same
time
two
casks
of
ale
set
near
the
gate
and
given
for
the
occasion
by
the
vicar
were
broached
and
their
foaming
contents
freely
distributed
among
the
dancers
and
the
thirsty
crowd
very
merry
were
they
as
may
be
supposed
in
consequence
but
their
mirth
was
happily
kept
within
due
limits
of
decorum
when
the
was
wellnigh
unladen
richard
assheton
entered
the
church
and
greatly
pleased
with
the
effect
of
the
flowery
garlands
with
which
the
various
pews
were
decorated
said
as
much
to
the
vicar
who
smilingly
replied
that
he
was
glad
to
find
he
approved
of
the
practice
even
though
it
might
savour
of
superstition
and
as
the
good
doctor
walked
away
being
called
forth
the
young
man
almost
unconsciously
turned
into
the
chapel
on
the
north
aisle
here
he
stood
for
a
few
moments
gazing
round
the
church
wrapt
in
pleasing
meditation
in
which
many
objects
somewhat
foreign
to
the
place
and
time
passed
through
his
mind
when
chancing
to
look
down
he
saw
a
small
funeral
wreath
of
mingled
yew
and
cypress
lying
at
his
feet
and
a
slight
tremor
passed
over
his
frame
as
he
found
he
was
standing
on
the
grave
of
abbot
paslew
before
he
could
ask
himself
by
whom
this
sad
garland
had
been
so
deposited
nicholas
assheton
came
up
to
him
and
with
a
look
of
great
uneasiness
cried
come
away
instantly
dick
do
you
know
where
you
are
standing
on
the
grave
of
the
last
abbot
of
whalley
replied
richard
smiling
have
you
forgotten
the
common
saying
cried
nicholas
that
the
assheton
who
stands
on
that
unlucky
grave
shall
die
within
the
year
come
away
at
once
it
is
too
late
replied
richard
i
have
incurred
the
fate
if
such
a
fate
be
attached
to
the
tomb
and
as
my
moving
away
will
not
preserve
me
so
my
tarrying
here
can
not
injure
me
further
but
i
have
no
fear
you
have
more
courage
than
i
possess
rejoined
nicholas
i
would
not
set
foot
on
that
accursed
stone
for
half
the
county
its
malign
influence
on
our
house
has
been
approved
too
often
the
first
to
experience
the
fatal
destiny
were
richard
assheton
and
john
braddyll
the
purchasers
of
the
abbey
both
met
here
together
on
the
anniversary
of
the
abbot
execution
some
forty
years
after
its
occurrence
it
is
true
and
when
they
were
both
pretty
well
stricken
in
years
and
within
that
year
namely
both
died
and
were
buried
in
the
vault
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
church
not
many
paces
from
their
old
enemy
the
last
instance
was
my
poor
brother
richard
who
being
incredulous
as
you
are
was
resolved
to
brave
the
destiny
and
stationed
himself
upon
the
tomb
during
divine
service
but
he
too
died
within
the
appointed
time
he
was
bewitched
to
death
so
at
least
it
is
affirmed
said
richard
assheton
with
a
smile
but
i
believe
in
one
evil
influence
just
as
much
as
in
the
other
it
matters
not
how
the
destiny
be
accomplished
so
it
come
to
pass
rejoined
the
squire
turning
away
heaven
shield
you
from
it
stay
said
richard
picking
up
the
wreath
who
think
you
can
have
placed
this
funeral
garland
on
the
abbot
grave
i
can
not
guess
cried
nicholas
staring
at
it
in
amazement
an
enemy
of
ours
most
likely
it
is
neither
customary
nor
lawful
in
our
protestant
country
so
to
ornament
graves
put
it
down
dick
i
shall
not
displace
it
certainly
replied
richard
laying
it
down
again
but
i
as
little
think
it
has
been
placed
here
by
a
hostile
hand
as
i
do
that
harm
will
ensue
to
me
from
standing
here
to
relieve
your
anxiety
however
i
will
come
forth
he
added
stepping
into
the
aisle
why
should
an
enemy
deposit
a
garland
on
the
abbot
tomb
since
it
was
by
mere
chance
that
it
hath
met
my
eyes
mere
chance
cried
nicholas
every
thing
is
mere
chance
with
you
philosophers
there
is
more
than
chance
in
it
my
mind
misgives
me
strangely
that
terrible
old
abbot
paslew
is
as
troublesome
to
us
in
death
as
he
was
during
life
to
our
predecessor
richard
assheton
not
content
with
making
his
tombstone
a
weapon
of
destruction
to
us
he
pays
the
abbey
itself
an
occasional
visit
and
his
appearance
always
betides
some
disaster
to
the
family
i
have
never
seen
him
myself
and
trust
i
never
shall
but
other
people
have
and
have
been
nigh
scared
out
of
their
senses
by
the
apparition
idle
tales
the
invention
of
overheated
brains
rejoined
richard
trust
me
the
abbot
rest
will
not
be
broken
till
the
day
when
all
shall
rise
from
their
tombs
though
if
ever
the
dead
supposing
such
a
thing
possible
could
be
justified
in
injuring
and
affrighting
the
living
it
might
be
in
his
case
since
he
mainly
owed
his
destruction
to
our
ancestor
on
the
same
principle
it
has
been
held
that
are
unlucky
to
their
lay
possessors
but
see
how
this
superstitious
notion
has
been
disproved
in
our
own
family
to
whom
whalley
abbey
and
its
domains
have
brought
wealth
power
and
worldly
happiness
there
is
something
in
the
notion
nevertheless
replied
nicholas
and
though
our
case
may
i
hope
continue
an
exception
to
the
rule
most
grantees
of
ecclesiastical
houses
have
found
them
a
curse
and
the
time
may
come
when
the
abbey
may
prove
so
to
our
descendants
but
without
discussing
the
point
there
is
one
instance
in
which
the
malignant
influence
of
the
vindictive
abbot
has
undoubtedly
extended
long
after
his
death
you
have
heard
i
suppose
that
he
pronounced
a
dreadful
anathema
upon
the
child
of
a
man
who
had
the
reputation
of
being
a
wizard
and
who
afterwards
acted
as
his
executioner
i
know
not
the
whole
particulars
of
the
dark
story
but
i
know
that
paslew
fixed
a
curse
upon
the
child
declaring
it
should
become
a
witch
and
the
mother
of
witches
and
the
prediction
has
been
verified
nigh
eighty
years
have
flown
by
since
then
and
the
infant
still
lives
a
fearful
and
mischievous
witch
and
all
her
family
are
similarly
fated
all
are
witches
i
never
heard
the
story
before
said
richard
somewhat
thoughtfully
but
i
guess
to
whom
you
allude
mother
demdike
of
pendle
forest
and
her
family
precisely
rejoined
nicholas
they
are
a
brood
of
witches
in
that
case
alizon
device
must
be
a
witch
cried
richard
and
i
think
you
will
hardly
venture
upon
such
an
assertion
after
what
you
have
seen
of
her
if
she
be
a
witch
i
would
there
were
many
such
as
fair
and
gentle
and
see
you
not
how
easily
the
matter
is
explained
a
dog
an
ill
name
and
hang
him
a
proverb
with
which
you
are
familiar
enough
so
with
mother
demdike
whether
really
uttered
or
not
the
abbot
curse
upon
her
and
her
issue
has
been
bruited
abroad
and
hence
she
is
made
a
witch
and
her
children
are
supposed
to
inherit
the
infamous
taint
so
it
is
with
yon
tomb
it
is
said
to
be
dangerous
to
our
family
and
dangerous
no
doubt
it
is
to
those
who
believe
in
the
saying
which
luckily
i
do
not
the
prophecy
works
its
own
fulfilment
the
absurdity
and
injustice
of
yielding
to
the
opinion
are
manifest
no
wrong
can
have
been
done
the
abbot
by
mother
demdike
any
more
than
by
her
children
and
yet
they
are
to
be
punished
for
the
misdeeds
of
their
predecessor
ay
just
as
you
and
i
who
are
of
the
third
and
fourth
generation
may
be
punished
for
the
sins
of
our
fathers
rejoined
nicholas
you
have
scripture
against
you
dick
the
only
thing
i
see
in
favour
of
your
argument
is
the
instance
you
allege
of
alizon
she
does
not
look
like
a
witch
certainly
but
there
is
no
saying
she
may
be
only
the
more
dangerous
for
her
rare
beauty
and
apparent
innocence
i
would
answer
for
her
truth
with
my
life
cried
richard
quickly
it
is
impossible
to
look
at
her
countenance
in
which
candour
and
purity
shine
forth
and
doubt
her
goodness
she
hath
cast
her
spells
over
you
dick
that
is
certain
rejoined
nicholas
laughing
but
to
be
serious
alizon
i
admit
is
an
exception
to
the
rest
of
the
family
but
that
only
strengthens
the
general
rule
did
you
ever
remark
the
strange
look
they
all
save
the
fair
maid
in
question
have
about
the
eyes
richard
answered
in
the
negative
it
is
very
singular
and
i
wonder
you
have
not
noticed
it
pursued
nicholas
but
the
question
of
reputed
witchcraft
in
mother
demdike
has
some
chance
of
being
speedily
settled
for
master
potts
the
little
london
lawyer
who
goes
with
us
to
pendle
forest
is
about
to
have
her
arrested
and
examined
before
a
magistrate
indeed
exclaimed
richard
this
must
be
prevented
why
so
exclaimed
nicholas
in
surprise
because
the
prejudice
existing
against
her
is
sure
to
convict
and
destroy
her
replied
richard
her
great
age
infirmities
and
poverty
will
be
proofs
against
her
how
can
she
or
any
old
enfeebled
creature
like
her
whose
decrepitude
and
misery
should
move
compassion
rather
than
excite
fear
how
can
such
a
person
defend
herself
against
charges
easily
made
and
impossible
to
refute
i
do
not
deny
the
possibility
of
witchcraft
even
in
our
own
days
though
i
think
it
of
very
unlikely
occurrence
but
i
would
determinately
resist
giving
credit
to
any
tales
told
by
the
superstitious
vulgar
who
naturally
prone
to
cruelty
have
so
many
motives
for
revenging
imaginary
wrongs
it
is
placing
a
dreadful
weapon
in
their
hands
of
which
they
have
cunning
enough
to
know
the
use
but
neither
mercy
nor
justice
enough
to
restrain
them
from
using
it
better
let
one
guilty
person
escape
than
many
innocent
perish
so
many
undefined
charges
have
been
brought
against
mother
demdike
that
at
last
they
have
fixed
a
stigma
on
her
name
and
made
her
an
object
of
dread
and
suspicion
she
is
endowed
with
mysterious
power
which
would
have
no
effect
if
not
believed
in
and
now
must
be
burned
because
she
is
called
a
witch
and
is
doting
and
vain
enough
to
accept
the
title
there
is
something
in
a
witch
difficult
nay
almost
impossible
to
describe
said
nicholas
but
you
can
not
be
mistaken
about
her
by
her
general
ill
course
of
life
by
repeated
acts
of
mischief
and
by
threats
followed
by
the
consequences
menaced
she
becomes
known
there
is
much
mystery
in
the
matter
not
permitted
human
knowledge
entirely
to
penetrate
but
as
we
know
from
the
scriptures
that
the
sin
of
witchcraft
did
exist
and
as
we
have
no
evidence
that
it
has
ceased
so
it
is
fair
to
conclude
that
there
may
be
practisers
of
the
dark
offence
in
our
own
days
and
such
i
hold
to
be
mother
demdike
and
mother
chattox
rival
potentates
in
evil
they
contend
which
shall
do
most
mischief
but
it
must
be
admitted
the
former
bears
away
the
bell
if
all
the
ill
attributed
to
her
were
really
caused
by
her
machinations
this
might
be
correct
replied
richard
but
it
only
shows
her
to
be
more
calumniated
than
the
other
in
a
word
cousin
nicholas
i
look
upon
them
as
two
poor
old
creatures
who
persuaded
they
really
possess
the
supernatural
power
accorded
to
them
by
the
vulgar
strive
to
act
up
to
their
parts
and
are
mainly
assisted
in
doing
so
by
the
credulity
and
fears
of
their
audience
admitting
the
blind
credulity
of
the
multitude
said
nicholas
and
their
proneness
to
discern
the
hand
of
the
witch
in
the
most
trifling
accidents
admitting
also
their
readiness
to
accuse
any
old
crone
unlucky
enough
to
offend
them
of
sorcery
i
still
believe
that
there
are
actual
practisers
of
the
black
art
who
for
a
brief
term
of
power
have
entered
into
a
league
with
satan
worship
him
and
attend
his
sabbaths
and
have
a
familiar
in
the
shape
of
a
cat
dog
toad
or
mole
to
obey
their
behests
transform
themselves
into
various
shapes
as
a
hound
horse
or
hare
raise
storms
of
wind
or
hail
maim
cattle
bewitch
and
slay
human
beings
and
ride
whither
they
will
on
broomsticks
but
holding
the
contrary
opinion
you
will
not
i
apprehend
aid
master
potts
in
his
quest
of
witches
i
will
not
rejoined
richard
on
the
contrary
i
will
oppose
him
but
enough
of
this
let
us
go
forth
and
they
quitted
the
church
together
as
they
issued
into
the
churchyard
they
found
the
principal
arbours
occupied
by
the
robin
hood
and
his
troop
doctor
ormerod
and
sir
ralph
having
retired
to
the
many
merry
groups
were
scattered
about
talking
laughing
and
singing
but
two
persons
seemingly
objects
of
suspicion
and
alarm
and
shunned
by
every
one
who
crossed
their
path
were
advancing
slowly
towards
the
three
crosses
of
paullinus
which
stood
in
a
line
not
far
from
the
they
were
females
one
about
very
comely
and
habited
in
smart
holiday
attire
put
on
with
considerable
rustic
coquetry
so
as
to
display
a
very
neat
foot
and
ankle
and
with
plenty
of
ribands
in
her
fine
chestnut
hair
the
other
was
a
very
different
person
far
advanced
in
years
bent
almost
double
her
arms
and
limbs
shaking
her
head
nodding
her
chin
wagging
her
snowy
locks
hanging
about
her
wrinkled
visage
her
brows
and
upper
lip
frore
and
her
eyes
almost
sightless
the
pupils
being
cased
with
a
thin
white
film
her
dress
of
antiquated
make
and
faded
stuff
had
been
once
deep
red
in
colour
and
her
old
black
hat
was
and
she
partly
aided
herself
in
walking
with
a
stick
and
partly
leaned
upon
her
younger
companion
for
support
why
there
is
one
of
the
old
women
we
have
just
been
speaking
of
mother
chattox
said
richard
pointing
them
out
and
with
her
her
pretty
nan
redferne
so
it
is
cried
nicholas
what
makes
the
old
hag
here
i
marvel
i
will
go
question
her
so
saying
he
strode
quickly
towards
her
how
now
mother
chattox
he
cried
what
mischief
is
afoot
what
makes
the
owl
abroad
in
the
glare
of
day
what
brings
the
grisly
from
her
forest
lair
back
to
thy
den
old
witch
crazed
as
well
as
blind
and
palsied
that
thou
knowest
not
that
this
is
a
and
not
a
devil
sabbath
back
to
thy
hut
i
say
these
sacred
precincts
are
no
place
for
thee
who
is
it
speaks
to
me
demanded
the
old
hag
halting
and
fixing
her
glazed
eyes
upon
him
one
thou
hast
much
injured
replied
nicholas
one
into
whose
house
thou
hast
brought
sickness
and
death
by
thy
infernal
arts
one
thou
hast
good
reason
to
fear
for
learn
to
thy
confusion
thou
damned
and
murtherous
witch
it
is
nicholas
brother
to
thy
victim
richard
assheton
of
downham
who
speaks
to
thee
i
know
none
i
have
reason
to
fear
replied
mother
chattox
especially
thee
nicholas
assheton
thy
brother
was
no
victim
of
mine
thou
wert
the
gainer
by
his
death
not
i
why
should
i
slay
him
i
will
tell
thee
why
old
hag
cried
nicholas
he
was
inflamed
by
the
beauty
of
thy
nancy
here
and
it
was
to
please
tom
redferne
her
sweetheart
then
but
her
spouse
since
that
thou
bewitchedst
him
to
death
that
reason
will
not
avail
thee
nicholas
rejoined
mother
chattox
with
a
derisive
laugh
if
i
had
any
hand
in
his
death
it
was
to
serve
and
pleasure
thee
and
that
all
men
shall
know
if
i
am
questioned
on
the
subject
ha
ha
take
me
to
the
crosses
nance
thou
shalt
not
thus
thou
murtherous
hag
cried
nicholas
furiously
nay
let
her
go
her
way
said
richard
who
had
drawn
near
during
the
colloquy
no
good
will
come
of
meddling
with
her
who
that
asked
mother
chattox
quickly
illustration
nan
redferne
and
mother
chattox
master
richard
assheton
o
middleton
whispered
nan
redferne
another
of
these
accursed
asshetons
cried
mother
chattox
a
plague
seize
them
boh
he
an
kindly
remarked
her
or
not
kindly
or
cruel
i
hate
them
all
cried
mother
chattox
to
the
crosses
i
say
but
nicholas
placed
himself
in
their
path
is
it
to
pray
to
beelzebub
thy
master
that
thou
wouldst
go
to
the
crosses
he
asked
out
of
my
way
pestilent
fool
cried
the
hag
thou
shalt
not
stir
till
i
have
had
an
answer
rejoined
nicholas
they
say
those
are
runic
obelisks
and
not
christian
crosses
and
that
the
carvings
upon
them
have
a
magical
signification
the
first
it
is
averred
is
written
with
deadly
curses
and
the
forms
in
which
they
are
traced
as
serpentine
triangular
or
round
indicate
and
rule
their
swift
or
slow
effect
the
second
bears
charms
against
diseases
storms
and
lightning
and
on
the
third
is
inscribed
a
verse
which
will
render
him
who
can
read
it
rightly
invisible
to
mortal
view
thou
shouldst
be
learned
in
such
lore
old
pythoness
is
it
so
the
hag
chin
wagged
fearfully
and
her
frame
trembled
with
passion
but
she
spoke
not
have
you
been
in
the
church
old
woman
interposed
richard
ay
wherefore
she
rejoined
some
one
has
placed
a
cypress
wreath
on
abbot
paslew
grave
was
it
you
he
asked
what
hast
thou
found
it
cried
the
hag
it
shall
bring
thee
rare
luck
lad
rare
luck
now
let
me
pass
not
yet
cried
nicholas
forcibly
grasping
her
withered
arm
the
hag
uttered
a
scream
of
rage
let
me
go
nicholas
assheton
she
shrieked
or
thou
shalt
rue
it
cramps
and
aches
shall
wring
and
rack
thy
flesh
and
bones
fever
shall
consume
thee
ague
shake
thee
shake
thee
ha
and
nicholas
recoiled
appalled
by
her
fearful
gestures
you
carry
your
malignity
too
far
old
woman
said
richard
severely
and
thou
darest
tell
me
so
cried
the
hag
set
me
before
him
nance
that
i
may
curse
him
she
added
raising
her
palsied
arm
nah
nah
cursed
ower
much
already
grandmother
cried
nan
redferne
endeavouring
to
drag
her
away
but
the
old
woman
resisted
i
will
teach
him
to
cross
my
path
she
vociferated
in
accents
shrill
and
jarring
as
the
cry
of
the
handsome
he
is
it
may
be
now
but
he
shall
not
be
so
long
the
bloom
shall
fade
from
his
cheek
the
fire
be
extinguished
in
his
eyes
the
strength
depart
from
his
limbs
sorrow
shall
be
her
portion
who
loves
him
sorrow
and
shame
horrible
exclaimed
richard
endeavouring
to
exclude
the
voice
of
the
crone
which
pierced
his
ears
like
some
sharp
instrument
ha
ha
you
fear
me
now
she
cried
by
this
and
this
the
spell
shall
work
she
added
describing
a
circle
in
the
air
with
her
stick
then
crossing
it
twice
and
finally
scattering
over
him
a
handful
of
grave
dust
snatched
from
an
adjoining
hillock
now
lead
me
quickly
to
the
smaller
cross
nance
she
added
in
a
low
tone
her
complied
with
a
glance
of
deep
commiseration
at
richard
who
remained
stupefied
at
the
ominous
proceeding
ah
this
must
indeed
be
a
witch
he
cried
recovering
from
the
momentary
shock
so
you
are
convinced
at
last
rejoined
nicholas
i
can
take
breath
now
the
old
is
gone
but
she
shall
not
escape
us
keep
an
eye
upon
her
while
i
see
if
simon
sparshot
the
beadle
be
within
the
churchyard
and
if
so
he
shall
take
her
into
custody
and
lock
her
in
the
cage
with
this
he
ran
towards
the
throng
shouting
lustily
for
the
beadle
presently
a
big
burly
fellow
in
a
scarlet
doublet
laced
with
gold
a
black
velvet
cap
trimmed
with
red
ribands
yellow
hose
and
shoes
with
great
roses
in
them
and
bearing
a
long
staff
answered
the
summons
and
upon
being
told
why
his
services
were
required
immediately
roared
out
at
the
top
of
a
stentorian
voice
a
witch
lads
a
witch
all
was
astir
in
an
instant
robin
hood
and
his
merry
men
with
the
rushed
out
of
their
bowers
and
the
whole
churchyard
was
in
agitation
above
the
din
was
heard
the
loud
voice
of
simon
sparshot
still
shouting
a
witch
witch
mother
chattox
where
where
demanded
several
voices
yonder
replied
nicholas
pointing
to
the
further
cross
a
general
movement
took
place
in
that
direction
the
crowd
being
headed
by
the
squire
and
the
beadle
but
when
they
came
up
they
found
only
nan
redferne
standing
behind
the
obelisk
where
the
devil
is
the
old
witch
gone
dick
cried
nicholas
in
dismay
i
thought
i
saw
her
standing
there
with
her
replied
richard
but
in
truth
i
did
not
watch
very
closely
search
for
her
search
for
her
cried
nicholas
but
neither
behind
the
crosses
nor
behind
any
monument
nor
in
any
hole
or
corner
nor
on
the
other
side
of
the
churchyard
wall
nor
at
the
back
of
the
little
hermitage
or
chapel
though
all
were
quickly
examined
could
the
old
hag
be
found
on
being
questioned
nan
redferne
refused
to
say
aught
concerning
her
grandmother
flight
or
place
of
concealment
i
begin
to
think
there
is
some
truth
in
that
strange
legend
of
the
cross
said
nicholas
notwithstanding
her
blindness
the
old
hag
must
have
managed
to
read
the
magic
verse
upon
it
and
so
have
rendered
herself
invisible
but
we
have
got
the
young
witch
safe
yeigh
squoire
responded
sparshot
who
had
seized
hold
of
nance

said
richard
assheton
authoritatively
neaw

the
beadle
in
amazement
no
more
than
any
of
these
lasses

us
said
richard

sparshot
i
forbid
him
to
do
so
till

has
been
examined
cried
a
sharp
voice
and
the
next
moment
master
potts
was
seen
pushing
his
way
through
the
crowd
so
you
have
found
a
witch
my
masters
i
heard

shouts
and
hurried
on
as

sparshot

cried
the
young
woman
by
this
time
the
crowd
had
gathered
round
her
yelling
hooting
and
shaking
their
hands
at
her
as
if
about
to
tear
her
in
pieces
but
richard
assheton
planted
himself
resolutely
before
her
and
pushed
back
the
foremost
of
them
remove
her
instantly
to
the
abbey

cried
and

nicholas

cried
potts
opening
his
round
eyes
to
their
widest
extent
not
many
minutes
since
replied
nicholas
in
fact

be
here

potts
looking
round

your
quickness
replied
nicholas
she
has
rendered
herself
invisible
by
reciting
the
magical
verses
inscribed
on
that
cross
indeed
exclaimed
the
attorney
closely
examining
the
mysterious
inscriptions
what
strange
uncouth
characters
i
can
make
neither
head
nor
tail
unless
it
be
the
devil
tail
of
them
at
this
moment
a
whoop
was
raised
by
jem
device
who
having
taken
his
little
sister
home
had
returned
to
the
sports
on
the
green
and
now
formed
part
of
the
assemblage
in
the
churchyard
between
the
rival
witch
potentates
mothers
demdike
and
chattox
it
has
already
been
said
a
deadly
enmity
existed
and
the
feud
was
carried
on
with
equal
animosity
by
their
descendants
and
though
jem
himself
came
under
the
same
suspicion
as
nan
redferne
that
circumstance
created
no
tie
of
interest
between
them
but
the
contrary
and
he
was
the
most
active
of
her
assailants
he
had
set
up
the
cry
from
observing
a
large
rat
running
along
the
side
of
the
wall
theere
hoo
goes
whooped
jem
witch
i
th
shape
ov
a
rotten
half
the
crowd
started
in
pursuit
of
the
animal
and
twenty
sticks
were
thrown
at
it
but
a
stone
cast
by
jem
stayed
its
progress
and
it
was
instantly
despatched
it
did
not
change
however
as
was
expected
by
the
credulous
hinds
into
an
old
woman
and
they
gave
vent
to
their
disappointment
and
rage
in
renewed
threats
against
nan
redferne
the
dead
rat
was
hurled
at
her
by
jem
but
missing
its
mark
it
hit
master
potts
on
the
head
and
nearly
knocked
him
off
the
cross
upon
which
he
had
mounted
to
obtain
a
better
view
of
the
proceedings
irritated
by
this
circumstance
as
well
as
by
the
failure
of
the
experiment
the
little
attorney
jumped
down
and
fell
to
kicking
the
unfortunate
rat
after
which
his
fury
being
somewhat
appeased
he
turned
to
nance
who
had
sunk
for
support
against
the
pedestal
and
said
to
her
if
you
will
tell
us
what
has
become
of
the
old
witch
your
grandmother
and
undertake
to
bear
witness
against
her
you
shall
be
set
free

nance
doggedly
put
me
to
onny
trial
ye
like
ye
shanna
get
a
word
fro
me
that
remains
to
be
seen
retorted
potts
but
i
apprehend
we
shall
make
you
speak
and
pretty
plainly
too
before
we
done
with
you
hear
what
this
perverse
and
young
witch
declares
masters
he
shouted
again
clambering
upon
the
cross
i
have
offered
her
liberty
on
condition
of
disclosing
to
us
the
manner
of
her
diabolical
old
relative
evasion
and
she
rejects
it
an
angry
roar
followed
mixed
with
cries
from
jem
device
of
swim
her
swim
her
you
had
better
tell
them
what
you
know
nance
said
richard
in
a
low
tone
or
i
shall
have
difficulty
in
preserving
you
from
their
fury
ey
darena
master
richard
she
replied
shaking
her
head
and
then
she
added
firmly
ey
winna
finding
it
useless
to
reason
with
her
and
fearing
also
that
the
infuriated
crowd
might
attempt
to
put
their
threats
into
execution
richard
turned
to
his
cousin
nicholas
and
said
we
must
get
her
away
or
violence
will
be
done
she
does
not
deserve
your
compassion
dick
replied
nicholas
she
is
only
a
few
degrees
better
than
the
old
hag
who
has
escaped
sparshot

said

with
a
half
smile
but
let

be
put
to
some
mild
trial
weighed
against
the
church
bible
be
it
so
replied
potts
jumping
down
but
if
that
fail
we
must
have
recourse
to
stronger
measures
take
notice
that
with
all
her
fright
she
has
not
been
able
to
shed
a

not
a

completely

audacity

your
spirit
young
woman
i
can
promise
you
rejoined
potts
as
soon
as
it
was
known
what
was
about
to
occur
the
whole
crowd
moved
towards
the
church
porch
nan
redferne
walking
between
richard
assheton
and
the
beadle
who
kept
hold
of
her
arm
to
prevent
any
attempt
at
escape
and
by
the
time
they
reached
the
appointed
place
ben
baggiley
the
baker
who
had
been
despatched
for
the
purpose
appeared
with
an
enormous
pair
of
wooden
scales
while
sampson
harrop
the
clerk
having
visited
the
pulpit
came
forth
with
the

immense
volume
bound
in

with

silver
clasps

that
a

potts
eyeing
it
with
satisfaction
it
looks
like
my
honourable
and
singular
good

of
the
laws
of

only
that
that

bound

we
say
large
as

scarce
prove
heavy
enough
to
weigh
down
the

opine
observed
nicholas
with
a
smile
we
shall
see
sir
replied
potts
we
shall
see
by
this
time
the
scales
having
been
affixed
to
a
hook
in
the
porch
by
baggiley
the
sacred
volume
was
placed
on
one
side
and
nance
set
down
by
the
beadle
on
the
other
the
result
of
the
experiment
was
precisely
what
might
have
been
anticipated
the
moment
the
young
woman
took
her
place
in
the
balance
it
sank
down
to
the
ground
while
the
other
kicked
the
beam
i

you
are
satisfied

piteously

added
thrusting
nance
backward
and
presenting
his
sword
at
the
breast
of

who
attempted
to
follow
her
and
who
retired
muttering
threats
and
curses
i

the

made

after

with
rage
cried
out
to

nevertheless

richard
put
an
end
to
further
altercation
by
stepping
back
quickly
locking
the
door
and
then
taking
out
the
key
and
putting
it
into
his
pocket
she
is
quite
safe
now
he
cried
with
a
smile
at
the
discomfited

quick
and
let

cried
potts
justice
must
not
be
thwarted
in
this
shameful
manner
while
the
greater
part
of
the
crowd
set
off
after
potts
and
the
beadle
richard
assheton
anxious
to
know
what
had
become
of
the
fugitive
and
determined
not
to
abandon
her
while
any
danger
existed
unlocked
the
and
entered
the
holy
structure
followed
by
nicholas
on
looking
around
nance
was
nowhere
to
be
seen
neither
did
she
answer
to
his
repeated
calls
and
richard
concluded
she
must
have
escaped
when
all
at
once
a
loud
exulting
shout
was
heard
without
leaving
no
doubt
that
the
poor
young
woman
had
again
fallen
into
the
hands
of
her
captors
the
next
moment
a
sharp
piercing
scream
in
a
female
key
confirmed
the
supposition
on
hearing
this
cry
richard
instantly
flew
to
the
opposite
door
through
which
nance
must
have
passed
but
on
trying
it
he
found
it
fastened
outside
and
filled
with
sudden
misgiving
for
he
now
recollected
leaving
the
key
in
the
other
door
he
called
to
nicholas
to
come
with
him
and
hurried
back
to
it
his
apprehensions
were
verified
the
door
was
locked
at
first
nicholas
was
inclined
to
laugh
at
the
trick
played
them
but
a
single
look
from
richard
checked
his
tendency
to
merriment
and
he
followed
his
young
relative
who
had
sprung
to
a
window
looking
upon
that
part
of
the
churchyard
whence
the
shouts
came
and
flung
it
open
richard
egress
however
was
prevented
by
an
iron
bar
and
he
called
out
loudly
and
fiercely
to
the
beadle
whom
he
saw
standing
in
the
midst
of
the
crowd
to
unlock
the
door
have
a
little
patience
good
master
richard
replied
potts
turning
up
his
provoking
little
visage
now
charged
with
triumphant
malice
you
shall
come
out
presently
we
are
busy
just
now
engaged
in
binding
the
witch
as
you
see
both
keys
are
safely
in
my
pocket
and
i
will
send
you
one
of
them
when
we
start
for
the
river
good
master
richard
we
lawyers
are
not
to
be
overreached
you
see
ha
ha
you
shall
repent
this
conduct
when
i
do
get
out
cried
richard
furiously
sparshot
i
command
you
to
bring
the
key
instantly
but
encouraged
by
the
attorney
the
beadle
affected
not
to
hear
richard
angry
vociferations
and
the
others
were
unable
to
aid
the
young
man
if
they
had
been
so
disposed
and
all
were
too
much
interested
in
what
was
going
forward
to
run
off
to
the
vicarage
and
acquaint
sir
ralph
with
the
circumstances
in
which
his
relatives
were
placed
even
though
enjoined
to
do
so
on
being
set
free
by
richard
nance
had
flown
quickly
through
the
church
and
passed
out
at
the
side
door
and
was
making
good
her
retreat
at
the
back
of
the
edifice
when
her
flying
figure
was
descried
by
jem
device
who
failing
in
his
first
attempt
had
run
round
that
way
fancying
he
should
catch
her
he
instantly
dashed
after
her
with
all
the
fury
of
a
bloodhound
and
being
possessed
of
remarkable
activity
speedily
overtook
her
and
heedless
of
her
threats
and
entreaties
secured
her
lem
me
go
jem
she
cried
an
ey

do
thee
a
good
turn
one
o
these
days
when
theaw
may
chonce
to
be
i
th

strait
os
me
but
seeing
him
inexorable
she
added
my
granddame
shan
rack
thy
boans
sorely
lad
for
this
jem
replied
by
a
coarse
laugh
of
defiance
and
dragging
her
along
delivered
her
to
master
potts
and
the
beadle
who
were
then
hurrying
to
the
other
door
of
the
church
to
prevent
interruption
the
cunning
attorney
having
ascertained
that
the
two
asshetons
were
inside
instantly
gave
orders
to
have
both
doors
locked
and
the
injunctions
being
promptly
obeyed
he
took
possession
of
the
keys
himself
chuckling
at
the
success
of
the
stratagem
a
fair
reprisal
he
muttered
this
young
milksop
shall
find
he
is
no
match
for
a
skilful
lawyer
like
me
now
the
cords
the
cords
it
was
at
the
sight
of
the
bonds
which
were
quickly
brought
by
baggiley
that
nance
uttered
the
piercing
cry
that
had
roused
indignation
feeling
secure
of
his
prisoner
and
now
no
longer
apprehensive
of
interruption
master
potts
was
in
no
hurry
to
conclude
the
arrangements
but
rather
prolonged
them
to
exasperate
richard
little
consideration
was
shown
the
unfortunate
captive
the
new
shoes
and
stockings
of
which
she
had
been
so
vain
a
short
time
before
were
torn
from
her
feet
and
limbs
by
the
rude
hands
of
the
remorseless
jem
and
the
beadle
and
bent
down
by
the
main
force
of
these
two
strong
men
her
thumbs
and
great
toes
were
tightly
bound
together
crosswise
by
the
cords
the
churchyard
rang
with
her
shrieks
and
with
his
blood
boiling
with
indignation
at
the
sight
richard
redoubled
his
exertions
to
burst
through
the
window
and
fly
to
her
assistance
but
though
nicholas
now
lent
his
powerful
aid
to
the
task
their
combined
efforts
to
obtain
liberation
were
unavailing
and
with
rage
almost
amounting
to
frenzy
richard
beheld
the
poor
young
woman
borne
shrieking
away
by
her
captors
nor
was
nicholas
much
less
incensed
and
he
swore
a
deep
oath
when
he
did
get
at
liberty
that
master
potts
should
pay
dearly
for
his
rascally
conduct
chapter
the
ordeal
by
swimming
bound
hand
and
foot
in
the
painful
posture
before
described
roughly
and
insolently
handled
on
all
sides
in
peril
of
her
life
from
the
frightful
ordeal
to
which
she
was
about
to
be
subjected
the
miserable
captive
was
borne
along
on
the
shoulders
of
jem
device
and
sparshot
her
long
fine
chestnut
hair
trailing
upon
the
ground
her
white
shoulders
exposed
to
the
insolent
gaze
of
the
crowd
and
her
trim
holiday
attire
torn
to
rags
by
the
rough
treatment
she
had
experienced
nance
redferne
it
has
been
said
was
a
very
comely
young
woman
but
neither
her
beauty
her
youth
nor
her
sex
had
any
effect
upon
the
ferocious
crowd
who
were
too
much
accustomed
to
such
brutal
and
debasing
exhibitions
to
feel
any
thing
but
savage
delight
in
the
spectacle
of
a
so
scandalously
treated
and
tormented
and
the
only
excuse
to
be
offered
for
their
barbarity
is
the
firm
belief
they
entertained
that
they
were
dealing
with
a
witch
and
when
even
in
our
own
day
so
many
revolting
scenes
are
enacted
to
gratify
the
brutal
passions
of
the
mob
while
are
tolerated
and
wretched
animals
goaded
on
to
tear
each
other
in
pieces
it
is
not
to
be
wondered
at
that
in
times
of
less
enlightenment
and
refinement
greater
cruelties
should
be
practised
indeed
it
may
be
well
to
consider
how
far
we
have
really
advanced
in
civilisation
since
then
for
until
cruelty
whether
to
man
or
beast
be
wholly
banished
from
our
sports
we
can
not
justly
reproach
our
ancestors
or
congratulate
ourselves
on
our
improvement
nance
cries
of
distress
were
only
answered
by
jeers
and
renewed
insults
and
wearied
out
at
length
the
poor
creature
ceased
struggling
and
shrieking
the
dogged
resolution
she
had
before
exhibited
again
coming
to
her
aid
but
her
fortitude
was
to
be
yet
more
severely
tested
revealed
by
the
disorder
of
her
habiliments
and
contrasting
strongly
with
the
extreme
whiteness
of
her
skin
a
mole
was
discovered
upon
her
breast
it
was
pointed
out
to
potts
by
jem
device
who
declared
it
to
be
a
and
the
spot
where
her
familiar
drained
her
blood
this
is
one
of
the
helps
to
the
discovery
of
a
witch
pointed
out
by
our
sovereign
lord
the
king
said
the
attorney
narrowly
examining
the
spot
one
saith
our
wise
prince
the
finding
of
their
mark
and
the
trying
the
insensibleness
thereof
the
other
is
their
fleeting
on
the
water

will
come
presently
but
the
insensibility
of
the
mark
might
be
at
once
attested
yeigh
that
con
soon

tried
cried
jem
with
a
savage
laugh
and
taking
a
pin
from
his
sleeve
the
ruffian
plunged
it
deeply
into
the
poor
creature
flesh
nance
winced
but
she
set
her
teeth
hardly
and
repressed
the
cry
that
must
otherwise
have
been
wrung
from
her
a
clear
witch
cried
jem
drawing
forth
the
pin

may

ye
villain
after
this
barbarous
test
the
crowd
confirmed
by
it
in
their
notions
of
nan
guiltiness
hurried
on
their
numbers
increasing
as
they
proceeded
along
the
main
street
of
the
village
leading
towards
the
river
all
the
villagers
left
at
home
rushing
forth
on
hearing
a
witch
was
about
to
be
swum
and
when
they
came
within
a
of
the
stream
sparshot
called
to
baggiley
to
lay
hold
of
nance
while
he
himself
accompanied
by
several
of
the
crowd
ran
over
the
bridge
the
part
he
had
to
enact
requiring
him
to
be
on
the
other
side
of
the
water
meantime
the
main
party
turned
down
a
little
footpath
protected
by
a
gate
on
the
left
which
led
between
garden
hedges
to
the
grassy
banks
of
the
calder
and
in
taking
this
course
they
passed
by
the
cottage
of
elizabeth
device
hearing
the
shouts
of
the
rabble
little
jennet
who
had
been
in
no
very
happy
frame
of
mind
since
she
had
been
brought
home

and
seeing

saith
our
sagacious
sovereign
i

something
of
this
girl
she
seems
a
remarkably
quick
child
remarkably
quick
ha
ha
by
this
time
the
party
having
gained
the
broad
flat
mead
through
which
the
calder
flowed
took
their
way
quickly
towards
its
banks
the
spot
selected
for
the
ordeal
lying
about
fifty
yards
above
the
weir
where
the
current
ordinarily
rapid
was
checked
by
the
dam
offering
a
smooth
surface
with
considerable
depth
of
water
if
soft
natural
beauties
could
have
subdued
the
hearts
of
those
engaged
in
this
cruel
and
wicked
experiment
never
was
scene
better
calculated
for
the
purpose
than
that
under
contemplation
through
a
lovely
green
valley
meandered
the
calder
now
winding
round
some
verdant
knoll
now
washing
the
base
of
lofty
heights
feathered
with
timber
to
their
very
summits
now
lost
amid
thick
woods
and
only
discernible
at
intervals
by
a
glimmer
amongst
the
trees
immediately
in
front
of
the
assemblage
rose
whalley
nab
its
steep
sides
and
brow
partially
covered
with
timber
with
green
patches
in
the
uplands
where
sheep
and
cattle
fed
just
below
the
spot
where
the
crowd
were
collected
the
stream
here
of
some
width
passed
over
the
weir
and
swept
in
a
foaming
cascade
over
the
huge
stones
supporting
the
dam
giving
the
rushing
current
the
semblance
and
almost
the
beauty
of
a
natural
waterfall
below
this
the
stream
ran
brawling
on
in
a
wider
but
shallower
channel
making
pleasant
music
as
it
went
and
leaving
many
dry
beds
of
sand
and
gravel
in
the
midst
while
a
hundred
yards
lower
down
it
was
crossed
by
the
arches
of
the
bridge
further
still
a
row
of
tall
cypresses
lined
the
bank
of
the
river
and
screened
that
part
of
the
abbey
converted
into
a
residence
by
the
asshetons
and
after
this
came
the
ruins
of
the
refectory
the
cloisters
the
dormitory
the
conventual
church
and
other
parts
of
the
venerable
structure
overshadowed
by
noble
and
elms
lovelier
or
more
peaceful
scene
could
not
be
imagined
the
green
meads
the
bright
clear
stream
with
its
white
foaming
weir
the
woody
heights
reflected
in
the
glassy
waters
the
picturesque
old
bridge
and
the
dark
grey
ruins
beyond
it
all
might
have
engaged
the
attention
and
melted
the
heart
then
the
hour
when
evening
was
coming
on
and
when
each
beautiful
object
deriving
new
beauty
from
the
medium
through
which
it
was
viewed
exercised
a
softening
influence
and
awakened
kindly
emotions
to
most
the
scene
was
familiar
and
therefore
could
have
no
charm
of
novelty
to
potts
however
it
was
altogether
new
but
he
was
susceptible
of
few
gentle
impressions
and
neither
the
tender
beauty
of
the
evening
nor
the
wooing
loveliness
of
the
spot
awakened
any
responsive
emotion
in
his
breast
he
was
dead
to
every
thing
except
the
ruthless
experiment
about
to
be
made
almost
at
the
same
time
that
jem
device
and
his
party
reached
the
near
bank
of
the
stream
the
beadle
and
the
others
appeared
on
the
opposite
side
little
was
said
but
instant
preparations
were
made
for
the
ordeal
two
long
coils
of
rope
having
been
brought
by
baggiley
one
of
them
was
made
fast
to
the
right
arm
of
the
victim
and
the
other
to
the
left
and
this
done
jem
device
shouting
to
sparshot
to
look
out
flung
one
coil
of
rope
across
the
river
where
it
was
caught
with
much
dexterity
by
the
beadle
the
assemblage
then
spread
out
on
the
bank
while
jem
taking
the
poor
young
woman
in
his
arms
who
neither
spoke
nor
struggled
but
held
her
breath
tightly
approached
the
river
dunna
drown
her
jem
said
jennet
who
had
turned
very
pale
be
quiet
wench
rejoined
jem
gruffly
and
without
bestowing
further
attention
upon
her
he
let
down
his
burden
carefully
into
the
water
and
this
achieved
he
called
out
to
the
beadle
who
drew
her
slowly
towards
him
while
jem
guided
her
with
the
other
rope
the
crowd
watched
the
experiment
for
a
few
moments
in
profound
silence
but
as
the
poor
young
woman
who
had
now
reached
the
centre
of
the
stream
still
floated
being
supported
either
by
the
tension
of
the
cords
or
by
her
woollen
apparel
a
loud
shout
was
raised
that
she
could
not
sink
and
was
therefore
an
undeniable
witch
steady
lads
steady
a
moment
cried
potts
enchanted
with
the
success
of
the
experiment
leave
her
where
she
is
that
her
buoyancy
may
be
fully
attested
you
know
masters
he
cried
with
a
loud
voice
the
meaning
of
this
water
ordeal
our
sovereign
lord
and
master
the
king
in
his
wisdom
hath
graciously
vouchsafed
to
explain
the
matter
thus
he
saith
refuse
to
receive
them
meaning
witches
of
course
in
her
bosom
that
have
shaken
off
their
sacred
water
of
baptism
and
wilfully
refused
the
benefit
thereof
it
is
manifest
you
see
that
this
diabolical
young
woman
hath
renounced
her
baptism
for
the
water
rejecteth
her
potest
as
pliny
saith
she
floats
like
a
cork
or
as
if
the
clear
water
of
the
calder
had
suddenly
become
like
the
slab
salt
waves
of
the
dead
sea
in
which
nothing
can
sink
you
behold
the
marvel
with
your
own
eyes
my
masters
ay
ay
rejoined
baggiley
and
several
others
hoo
be
a
witch
fo
sartin
cried
jem
device
but
as
he
spoke
chancing
slightly
to
slacken
the
rope
the
tension
of
which
maintained
the
equilibrium
of
the
body
the
poor
woman
instantly
sank
a
groan
as
much
of
disappointment
as
sympathy
broke
from
the
spectators
but
none
attempted
to
aid
her
and
on
seeing
her
sink
jem
abandoned
the
rope
altogether
but
assistance
was
at
hand
two
persons
rushed
quickly
and
furiously
to
the
spot
they
were
richard
and
nicholas
assheton
the
iron
bar
had
at
length
yielded
to
their
efforts
and
the
first
use
they
made
of
their
freedom
was
to
hurry
to
the
river
a
glance
showed
them
what
had
occurred
and
the
younger
assheton
unhesitatingly
plunging
into
the
water
seized
the
rope
dropped
by
jem
and
calling
to
the
beadle
to
let
go
his
hold
dragged
forth
the
poor
young
woman
and
placed
her
on
the
bank
hewing
asunder
the
cords
that
bound
her
hands
and
feet
with
his
sword
but
though
still
sensible
nance
was
so
much
exhausted
by
the
shock
she
had
undergone
and
her
muscles
were
so
severely
strained
by
the
painful
and
unnatural
posture
to
which
she
had
been
compelled
that
she
was
wholly
unable
to
move
her
thumbs
were
blackened
and
swollen
and
the
cords
had
cut
into
the
flesh
while
blood
trickled
down
from
the
puncture
in
her
breast
fixing
a
look
of
inexpressible
gratitude
upon
her
preserver
she
made
an
effort
to
speak
but
the
exertion
was
too
great
violent
hysterical
sobbing
came
on
and
her
senses
soon
after
forsook
her
richard
called
loudly
for
assistance
and
the
sentiments
of
the
most
humane
part
of
the
crowd
having
undergone
a
change
since
the
failure
of
the
ordeal
some
females
came
forward
and
took
steps
for
her
restoration
sensibility
having
returned
a
cloak
was
wrapped
around
her
and
she
was
conveyed
to
a
neighbouring
cottage
and
put
to
bed
where
her
stiffened
limbs
were
chafed
and
warm
drinks
administered
and
it
began
to
be
hoped
that
no
serious
consequences
would
ensue
meanwhile
a
catastrophe
had
wellnigh
occurred
in
another
quarter
with
eyes
flashing
with
fury
nicholas
assheton
pushed
aside
the
crowd
and
made
his
way
to
the
bank
whereon
master
potts
stood
not
liking
his
looks
the
little
attorney
would
have
taken
to
his
heels
but
finding
escape
impossible
he
called
upon
baggiley
to
protect
him
but
he
was
instantly
in
the
forcible
gripe
of
the
squire
who
shouted
i
teach
you
mongrel
hound
to
play
tricks
with
gentlemen
master
nicholas
cried
the
terrified
and
attorney
my
very
good

to
let

alone
this
is

aggravated
circumstances
and
punishable
with
ignominious
corporal
penalties
besides

and

i
take

to

the
assault
master
baggiley
i

ah
o
o
oh
then
you
shall
have
something
to
bring
your
ac
ac
action
for

cried
nicholas
and
seizing
the
attorney
by
the
nape
of
the
neck
with
one
hand
and
the
hind
wings
of
his
doublet
with
the
other
he
cast
him
to
a
considerable
distance
into
the
river
where
he
fell
with
a
tremendous
splash
he
is
no
wizard
at
all
events
laughed
nicholas
as
potts
went
down
like
a
lump
of
lead
but
the
attorney
was
not
born
to
be
drowned
at
least
at
this
period
of
his
career
on
rising
to
the
surface
a
few
seconds
after
his
immersion
he
roared
lustily
for
help
but
would
infallibly
have
been
carried
over
the
weir
if
jem
device
had
not
flung
him
the
rope
now
disengaged
from
nance
redferne
and
which
he
succeeded
in
catching
in
this
way
he
was
dragged
out
and
as
he
crept
up
the
bank
with
the
wet
pouring
from
his
apparel
which
now
clung
tightly
to
his
lathy
limbs
he
was
greeted
by
the
jeers
of
nicholas
how
like
you
the
eh
master
attorney
no
occasion
for
a
second
trial
i
think
if

had
known
his

interest
he
would
have
left

the

eels
but

jem
growled
something
in
reply
and
seizing
his
little
sister
hand
strode
off
with
her
towards
his
mother
dwelling
uttering
not
a
word
by
the
way
having
seen
nance
redferne
conveyed
to
the
cottage
as
before
mentioned
richard
assheton
regardless
of
the
wet
state
of
his
own
apparel
now
joined
his
cousin
the
squire
and
they
walked
to
the
abbey
together
conversing
on
what
had
taken
place
while
the
crowd
dispersed
some
returning
to
the
bowers
in
the
churchyard
and
others
to
the
green
their
merriment
in
nowise
damped
by
the
recent
occurrences
which
they
looked
upon
as
part
of
the
day
sport
as
some
of
them
passed
by
laughing
singing
and
dancing
richard
assheton
remarked
i
can
scarcely
believe
these
to
be
the
same
people
i
so
lately
saw
in
the
churchyard
they
then
seemed
totally
devoid
of
humanity
pshaw
they
are
humane
enough
rejoined
nicholas
but
you
can
not
expect
them
to
show
mercy
to
a
witch
any
more
than
to
a
wolf
or
other
savage
and
devouring
beast
but
the
means
taken
to
prove
her
guilt
were
as
absurd
as
iniquitous
said
richard
and
savour
of
the
barbarous
ages
if
she
had
perished
all
concerned
in
the
trial
would
have
been
guilty
of
murder
but
no
judge
would
condemn
them
returned
nicholas
and
they
have
the
highest
authority
in
the
realm
to
uphold
them
as
to
leniency
to
witches
in
a
general
way
i
would
show
none
traitors
alike
to
god
and
man
and
bond
slaves
of
satan
they
are
out
of
the
pale
of
christian
charity
no
criminal
however
great
is
out
of
the
pale
of
christian
charity
replied
richard
but
such
scenes
as
we
have
just
witnessed
are
a
disgrace
to
humanity
and
a
mockery
of
justice
in
seeking
to
discover
and
punish
one
offence
a
greater
is
committed
suppose
this
poor
young
woman
really
guilty
what
then
our
laws
are
made
for
protection
as
well
as
punishment
of
wrong
she
should
he
arraigned
convicted
and
condemned
before
punishment
our
laws
admit
of
torture
richard
observed
nicholas
true
said
the
young
man
with
a
shudder
and
it
is
another
relic
of
a
ruthless
age
but
torture
is
only
allowed
under
the
eye
of
the
law
and
can
be
inflicted
by
none
but
its
sworn
servants
but
supposing
this
poor
young
woman
innocent
of
the
crime
imputed
to
her
which
i
really
believe
her
to
be
how
then
will
you
excuse
the
atrocities
to
which
she
has
been
subjected
i
do
not
believe
her
innocent
rejoined
nicholas
her
relationship
to
a
notorious
witch
and
her
fabrication
of
clay
images
make
her
justly
suspected
then
let
her
be
examined
by
a
magistrate
said
richard
but
even
then
woe
betide
her
when
i
think
that
alizon
device
is
liable
to
the
same
atrocious
treatment
in
consequence
of
her
relationship
to
mother
demdike
i
can
scarce
contain
my
indignation
it
is
unlucky
for
her
indeed
rejoined
nicholas
but
of
all
assailants
the
most
infuriated
was
alizon
brother
jem
device
i
saw
it
cried
richard
an
uneasy
expression
passing
over
his
countenance
would
she
could
be
removed
from
that
family
to
what
purpose
demanded
nicholas
quickly
her
family
are
more
likely
to
be
removed
from
her
if
master
potts
stay
in
the
neighbourhood
poor
girl
exclaimed
richard
and
he
fell
into
a
reverie
which
was
not
broken
till
they
reached
the
abbey
to
return
to
jem
device
on
reaching
the
cottage
the
ruffian
flung
himself
into
a
chair
and
for
a
time
seemed
lost
in
reflection
at
last
he
looked
up
and
said
gruffly
to
jennet
who
stood
watching
him

cried
elizabeth
quickly
look

tib
exclaimed
her
son
as
he
spoke
the
cat
sprang
towards
the
inner
door
and
scratched
violently
against
it
elizabeth
immediately
raised
the
latch
and
found
jennet
behind
it
with
a
face
like
scarlet
been
listenin

elizabeth

soundly

said
the
little
girl
repressing
her
tears
elizabeth
regarded
her
angrily
but
the
looks
of
the
child
were
so
spiteful
that
she
did
not
dare
to
strike
her
she
glanced
too
at
tib
but
the
uncertain
cat
was
now
rubbing
himself
in
the
most
friendly
manner
against
jennet
yo

her
mother
fiercely
jennet
replied
with
a
mocking
laugh
while
tib
rubbed
against
her
more
fondly
than
ever
let
her
alone
interposed
jem
an
now
ey
mun
be

so

ye
weel
mother
an
yo
too
jennet
and
with
this
he
put
on
his
cap
seized
his
cudgel
and
quitted
the
cottage
chapter
the
ruined
conventual
church
beneath
a
wild
planted
by
chance
in
the
abbey
gardens
and
of
such
remarkable
size
that
it
almost
rivalled
the
elms
and
lime
trees
surrounding
it
and
when
in
bloom
resembled
an
enormous
garland
stood
two
young
maidens
both
of
rare
beauty
though
in
totally
different
styles
the
one
being
and
with
a
snowy
skin
tinged
with
delicate
bloom
like
that
of
roses
seen
through
milk
to
borrow
a
simile
from
old
anacreon
while
the
other
far
eclipsed
her
in
the
brilliancy
of
her
complexion
the
dark
splendour
of
her
eyes
and
the
luxuriance
of
her
jetty
tresses
which
unbound
and
knotted
with
ribands
flowed
down
almost
to
the
ground
in
age
there
was
little
disparity
between
them
though
perhaps
the
girl
might
be
a
year
nearer
twenty
than
the
other
and
somewhat
more
of
seriousness
though
not
much
sat
upon
her
lovely
countenance
than
on
the
laughing
features
different
were
they
too
in
degree
and
here
social
position
was
infinitely
in
favour
of
the
fairer
girl
but
no
one
would
have
judged
it
so
if
not
previously
acquainted
with
their
history
indeed
it
was
rather
the
one
having
least
title
to
be
proud
if
any
one
has
such
title
who
now
seemed
to
look
up
to
her
companion
with
mingled
admiration
and
regard
the
latter
being
enthralled
at
the
moment
by
the
rich
notes
of
a
thrush
poured
from
a
neighbouring
pleasant
was
the
garden
where
the
two
girls
stood
shaded
by
great
trees
laid
out
in
exquisite
parterres
with
knots
and
figures
quaint
shorn
trees
and
hedges
covered
alleys
and
arbours
terraces
and
mounds
in
the
taste
of
the
time
and
above
all
an
admirably
kept
it
was
bounded
on
the
one
hand
by
the
ruined
and
vestry
of
the
old
monastic
structure
and
on
the
other
by
the
stately
pile
of
buildings
formerly
making
part
of
the
abbot
lodging
in
which
the
long
gallery
was
situated
some
of
its
windows
looking
upon
the
and
then
kept
in
excellent
condition
but
now
roofless
and
desolate
behind
them
on
the
right
half
hidden
by
trees
lay
the
desecrated
and
despoiled
conventual
church
reared
at
such
cost
and
with
so
much
magnificence
by
thirteen
abbots
the
great
work
having
been
commenced
as
heretofore
stated
by
robert
de
topcliffe
in
and
only
completed
in
all
its
details
by
john
paslew
this
splendid
structure
surpassing
according
to
whitaker
many
cathedrals
in
extent
was
now
abandoned
to
the
slow
ravages
of
decay
would
it
had
never
encountered
worse
enemy
but
some
half
century
later
the
hand
of
man
was
called
in
to
accelerate
its
destruction
and
it
was
then
almost
entirely
rased
to
the
ground
at
the
period
in
question
though
partially
unroofed
and
with
some
of
the
walls
destroyed
it
was
still
beautiful
and
picturesque
more
picturesque
indeed
than
in
the
days
of
its
pride
and
splendour
the
tower
with
its
lofty
crocketed
spire
was
still
standing
though
the
latter
was
cracked
and
tottering
and
the
jackdaws
roosted
within
its
windows
and
belfry
two
ranges
of
broken
columns
told
of
the
bygone
glories
of
the
aisles
and
the
beautiful
side
chapels
having
escaped
injury
better
than
other
parts
of
the
fabric
remained
in
tolerable
preservation
but
the
choir
and
high
altar
were
stripped
of
all
their
rich
carving
and
ornaments
and
the
rain
descended
through
the
open
upon
the
now
graves
of
the
abbots
in
the
presbytery
here
and
there
the
ramified
mullions
still
retained
their
wealth
of
painted
glass
and
the
grand
eastern
window
shone
gorgeously
as
of
yore
all
else
was
neglect
and
ruin
briers
and
turf
usurped
the
place
of
the
marble
pavement
many
of
the
pillars
were
festooned
with
ivy
and
in
some
places
the
shattered
walls
were
covered
with
creepers
and
trees
had
taken
root
in
the
crevices
of
the
masonry
beautiful
at
all
times
were
these
magnificent
ruins
but
never
so
beautiful
as
when
seen
by
the
witching
light
of
the
moon
the
hour
according
to
the
best
authority
when
all
ruins
should
be
viewed
when
the
long
lines
of
broken
pillars
the
mouldering
arches
and
the
still
glowing
panes
over
the
altar
had
a
magical
effect
in
front
of
the
maidens
stood
a
square
tower
part
of
the
defences
of
the
religious
establishment
erected
by
abbot
lyndelay
in
the
reign
of
edward
but
disused
and
decaying
it
was
sustained
by
high
and
richly
groined
arches
crossing
the
swift
and
faced
the
river
a
path
led
through
the
ruined
to
the
spacious
cloister
quadrangle
once
used
as
a
cemetery
for
the
monks
but
now
converted
into
a
kitchen
garden
its
broad
area
being
planted
out
and
trained
against
the
hoary
walls
little
of
the
old
refectory
was
left
except
the
dilapidated
stairs
once
conducting
to
the
gallery
where
the
brethren
were
wont
to
take
their
meals
but
the
inner
wall
still
served
to
enclose
the
garden
on
that
side
of
the
dormitory
formerly
constituting
the
eastern
angle
of
the
cloisters
the
shell
was
still
left
and
it
was
used
partly
as
a
grange
partly
as
a
shed
for
cattle
the
and
tenements
lying
on
this
side
thus
it
will
be
seen
that
the
garden
and
grounds
filling
up
the
ruins
of
whalley
abbey
offered
abundant
points
of
picturesque
attraction
all
of
which
with
the
exception
of
the
ruined
conventual
church
had
been
visited
by
the
two
girls
they
had
tracked
the
labyrinths
of
passages
scaled
the
broken
staircases
crept
into
the
roofless
and
neglected
chambers
peered
timorously
into
the
black
and
yawning
vaults
and
now
having
finished
their
investigations
had
paused
for
awhile
previous
to
extending
their
ramble
to
the
church
beneath
the
wild
to
listen
to
the
warbling
of
the
birds
you
should
hear
the
nightingales
at
middleton
alizon
observed
dorothy
assheton
breaking
silence
they
sing
even
more
exquisitely
than
yon
thrush
you
must
come
and
see
me
i
should
like
to
show
you
the
old
house
and
gardens
though
they
are
very
different
from
these
and
we
have
no
ancient
monastic
ruins
to
ornament
them
still
they
are
very
beautiful
and
as
i
find
you
are
fond
of
flowers
i
will
show
you
some
i
have
reared
myself
for
i
am
something
of
a
gardener
alizon
promise
you
will
come
i
wish
i
dared
promise
it
replied
alizon
and
why
not
then
cried
dorothy
what
should
prevent
you
do
you
know
alizon
what
i
should
like
better
than
all
you
are
so
amiable
and
so
good
and
so
so
very
pretty
nay
do
blush
there
is
no
one
by
to
hear
me
you
are
so
charming
altogether
that
i
should
like
you
to
come
and
live
with
me
you
shall
be
my
handmaiden
if
you
will
i
should
desire
nothing
better
sweet
young
lady
replied
alizon
but
but
what
cried
dorothy
you
have
only
your
own
consent
to
obtain
alas
i
have
replied
alizon
how
can
that
be
cried
dorothy
with
a
disappointed
look
it
is
not
likely
your
mother
will
stand
in
the
way
of
your
advancement
and
you
have
not
i
suppose
any
other
tie
nay
forgive
me
if
i
appear
too
inquisitive
my
curiosity
only
proceeds
from
the
interest
i
take
in
you
i
know
it
i
feel
it
dear
kind
young
lady
replied
alizon
with
the
colour
again
mounting
her
cheeks
i
have
no
tie
in
the
world
except
my
family
but
i
am
persuaded
my
mother
will
never
allow
me
to
quit
her
however
great
the
advantage
might
be
to
me
well
though
sorry
i
am
scarcely
surprised
at
it
said
dorothy
she
must
love
you
too
dearly
to
part
with
you
i
wish
i
could
think
so
sighed
alizon
proud
of
me
in
some
sort
though
with
little
reason
she
may
be
but
love
me
most
assuredly
she
does
not
nay
more
i
am
persuaded
she
would
be
glad
to
be
freed
from
my
presence
which
is
an
evident
restraint
and
annoyance
to
her
were
it
not
for
some
motive
stronger
than
natural
affection
that
binds
her
to
me
now
in
good
sooth
you
amaze
me
alizon
cried
dorothy
what
possible
motive
can
it
be
if
not
of
affection
of
interest
i
think
replied
alizon
i
speak
to
you
without
reserve
dear
young
lady
for
the
sympathy
you
have
shown
me
deserves
and
demands
confidence
on
my
part
and
there
are
none
with
whom
i
can
freely
converse
so
that
every
emotion
has
been
locked
up
in
my
own
bosom
my
mother
fancies
i
shall
one
day
be
of
use
to
her
and
therefore
keeps
me
with
her
hints
to
this
effect
she
has
thrown
out
when
indulging
in
the
uncontrollable
fits
of
passion
to
which
she
is
liable
and
yet
i
have
no
just
reason
to
complain
for
though
she
has
shown
me
little
maternal
tenderness
and
repelled
all
exhibition
of
affection
on
my
part
she
has
treated
me
very
differently
from
her
other
children
and
with
much
greater
consideration
i
can
make
slight
boast
of
education
but
the
best
the
village
could
afford
has
been
given
me
and
i
have
derived
much
religious
culture
from
good
doctor
ormerod
the
kind
ladies
of
the
vicarage
proposed
as
you
have
done
that
i
should
live
with
them
but
my
mother
forbade
it
enjoining
me
on
the
peril
of
incurring
her
displeasure
not
to
leave
her
and
reminding
me
of
all
the
benefits
i
have
received
from
her
and
of
the
necessity
of
making
an
adequate
return
and
ungrateful
indeed
i
should
be
if
i
did
not
comply
for
though
her
manner
is
harsh
and
cold
to
me
she
has
never
me
as
she
has
done
her
favourite
child
my
little
sister
jennet
but
has
always
allowed
me
a
separate
chamber
where
i
can
retire
when
i
please
to
read
or
meditate
or
pray
for
alas
dear
young
lady
i
dare
not
pray
before
my
mother
be
not
shocked
at
what
i
tell
you
but
i
can
not
hide
it
my
poor
mother
denies
herself
the
consolation
of
religion
never
addresses
herself
to
heaven
in
prayer
never
opens
the
book
of
life
and
truth
never
enters
church
in
her
own
mistaken
way
she
has
brought
up
poor
little
jennet
who
has
been
taught
to
make
a
scoff
at
religious
truths
and
ordinances
and
has
never
been
suffered
to
keep
holy
the
happy
and
thankful
am
i
that
no
such
evil
lessons
have
been
taught
me
but
rather
that
i
have
profited
by
the
sad
example
in
my
own
secret
chamber
i
have
prayed
daily
and
nightly
for
both
prayed
that
their
hearts
might
be
turned
often
have
i
besought
my
mother
to
let
me
take
jennet
to
church
but
she
never
would
consent
and
in
that
poor
misguided
child
dear
young
lady
there
is
a
strange
mixture
of
good
and
ill
afflicted
with
personal
deformity
and
delicate
in
health
the
mind
perhaps
sympathising
with
the
body
she
is
wayward
and
uncertain
in
temper
but
sensitive
and
keenly
alive
to
kindness
and
with
a
shrewdness
beyond
her
years
at
the
risk
of
offending
my
mother
for
i
felt
confident
i
was
acting
rightly
i
have
endeavoured
to
instil
religious
principles
into
her
heart
and
to
inspire
her
with
a
love
of
truth
sometimes
she
has
listened
to
me
and
i
have
observed
strange
struggles
in
her
nature
as
if
the
good
were
obtaining
mastery
of
the
evil
principle
and
i
have
striven
the
more
to
convince
her
and
win
her
over
but
never
with
entire
success
for
my
efforts
have
been
overcome
by
pernicious
counsels
and
sceptical
sneers
oh
dear
young
lady
what
would
i
not
do
to
be
the
instrument
of
her
salvation
you
pain
me
much
by
this
relation
alizon
said
dorothy
assheton
who
had
listened
with
profound
attention
and
i
now
wish
more
ardently
than
ever
to
take
you
from
such
a
family
i
can
not
leave
them
dear
young
lady
replied
alizon
for
i
feel
i
may
be
of
infinite
service
especially
to
jennet
by
staying
with
them
where
there
is
a
soul
to
be
saved
especially
the
soul
of
one
dear
as
a
sister
no
sacrifice
can
be
too
great
to
make
no
price
too
heavy
to
pay
by
the
blessing
of
heaven
i
hope
to
save
her
and
that
is
the
great
tie
that
binds
me
to
a
home
only
so
in
name
i
will
not
oppose
your
virtuous
intentions
dear
alizon
replied
dorothy
but
i
must
now
mention
a
circumstance
in
connexion
with
your
mother
of
which
you
are
perhaps
in
ignorance
but
which
it
is
right
you
should
know
and
therefore
no
false
delicacy
on
my
part
shall
restrain
me
from
mentioning
it
your
grandmother
old
demdike
is
in
very
ill
depute
in
pendle
and
is
stigmatised
by
the
common
folk
and
even
by
others
as
a
witch
your
mother
too
shares
in
the
opprobrium
attaching
to
her
i
dreaded
this
replied
alizon
turning
deadly
pale
and
trembling
violently
i
feared
you
had
heard
the
terrible
report
but
oh
believe
it
not
my
poor
mother
is
erring
enough
but
she
is
not
so
bad
as
that
oh
believe
it
not
i
will
not
believe
it
said
dorothy
since
she
is
blessed
with
such
a
daughter
as
you
but
what
i
fear
is
that
you
you
so
kind
so
good
so
beautiful
may
come
under
the
same
ban
i
must
run
this
risk
also
in
the
good
work
i
have
appointed
myself
replied
alizon
if
i
am
ill
thought
of
by
men
i
shall
have
the
approval
of
my
own
conscience
to
uphold
me
whatever
betide
and
whatever
be
said
do
not
you
think
ill
of
me
dear
young
lady
fear
it
not
returned
dorothy
earnestly
while
thus
conversing
they
gradually
strayed
away
from
the
and
taking
a
winding
path
leading
in
that
direction
entered
the
conventual
church
about
the
middle
of
the
south
aisle
after
gazing
with
wonder
and
delight
at
the
still
majestic
pillars
that
like
ghosts
of
the
departed
brethren
seemed
to
protest
against
the
desolation
around
them
they
took
their
way
along
the
nave
through
broken
arches
and
over
prostrate
fragments
of
stone
to
the
eastern
extremity
of
the
fane
and
having
admired
the
light
shafts
and
clerestory
windows
of
the
choir
as
well
as
the
magnificent
painted
glass
over
the
altar
they
stopped
before
an
arched
doorway
on
the
right
with
two
gothic
niches
in
one
of
which
was
a
small
stone
statue
of
saint
agnes
with
her
lamb
and
in
the
other
a
similar
representation
of
saint
margaret
crowned
and
piercing
the
dragon
with
a
cross
both
were
sculptures
of
much
merit
and
it
was
wonderful
they
had
escaped
destruction
the
door
was
closed
but
it
easily
opened
when
tried
by
dorothy
and
they
found
themselves
in
a
small
but
beautiful
chapel
what
struck
them
chiefly
in
it
was
a
magnificent
monument
of
white
marble
enriched
with
numerous
small
shields
painted
and
gilt
supporting
two
recumbent
figures
representing
henry
de
lacy
one
of
the
founders
of
the
abbey
and
his
consort
the
knight
was
cased
in
plate
armour
covered
with
a
surcoat
emblazoned
with
his
arms
and
his
feet
resting
upon
a
hound
this
superb
monument
was
wholly
uninjured
the
painting
and
gilding
being
still
fresh
and
bright
behind
it
a
flag
had
been
removed
discovering
a
flight
of
steep
stone
steps
leading
to
a
vault
or
other
subterranean
chamber
after
looking
round
this
chapel
dorothy
remarked
there
is
something
else
that
has
just
occurred
to
me
when
a
child
a
strange
dark
tale
was
told
me
to
the
effect
that
the
last
abbot
of
whalley
laid
his
dying
curse
upon
your
grandmother
then
an
infant
predicting
that
she
should
be
a
witch
and
the
mother
of
witches
i
have
heard
the
dread
tradition
too
rejoined
alizon
but
i
can
not
will
not
believe
it
an
power
will
never
sanction
such
terrible
imprecations
far
be
it
from
me
to
affirm
the
contrary
replied
dorothy
but
it
is
undoubted
that
some
families
have
been
and
are
under
the
influence
of
an
inevitable
fatality
in
one
respect
connected
also
with
the
same
unfortunate
prelate
i
might
instance
our
own
family
abbot
paslew
is
said
to
be
unlucky
to
us
even
in
his
grave
if
such
a
curse
as
i
have
described
hangs
over
the
head
of
your
family
all
your
efforts
to
remove
it
will
be
ineffectual
i
trust
not
said
alizon
oh
dear
young
lady
you
have
now
penetrated
the
secret
of
my
heart
the
mystery
of
my
life
is
laid
open
to
you
disguise
it
as
i
may
i
can
not
but
believe
my
mother
to
be
under
some
baneful
influence
her
unholy
life
her
strange
actions
all
impress
me
with
the
idea
and
there
is
the
same
tendency
in
jennet
you
have
a
brother
have
you
not
inquired
dorothy
i
have
returned
alizon
slightly
colouring
but
i
see
little
of
him
for
he
lives
near
my
grandmother
in
pendle
forest
and
always
avoids
me
in
his
rare
visits
here
you
will
think
it
strange
when
i
tell
you
i
have
never
beheld
my
grandmother
demdike
i
am
glad
to
hear
it
exclaimed
dorothy
i
have
never
even
been
to
pendle
pursued
alizon
though
jennet
and
my
mother
go
there
frequently
at
one
time
i
much
wished
to
see
my
aged
relative
and
pressed
my
mother
to
take
me
with
her
but
she
refused
and
now
i
have
no
desire
to
go
strange
exclaimed
dorothy
every
thing
you
tell
me
strengthens
the
idea
i
conceived
the
moment
i
saw
you
and
which
my
brother
also
entertained
that
you
are
not
the
daughter
of
elizabeth
device
did
your
brother
think
this
cried
alizon
eagerly
but
she
immediately
cast
down
her
eyes
he
did
replied
dorothy
not
noticing
her
confusion
is
impossible
he
said
that
lovely
girl
can
be
sprung
from
but
i
will
not
wound
you
by
adding
the
rest
i
can
not
disown
my
kindred
said
alizon
still
i
must
confess
that
some
notions
of
the
sort
have
crossed
me
arising
probably
from
my
mother
extraordinary
treatment
and
from
many
other
circumstances
which
though
trifling
in
themselves
were
not
without
weight
in
leading
me
to
the
conclusion
hitherto
i
have
treated
it
only
as
a
passing
fancy
but
if
you
and
master
richard
assheton
and
her
voice
slightly
faltered
as
she
pronounced
the
name
think
so
it
may
warrant
me
in
more
seriously
considering
the
matter
do
consider
it
most
seriously
dear
alizon
cried
dorothy
i
have
made
up
my
mind
and
richard
has
made
up
his
mind
too
that
you
are
not
mother
demdike
nor
elizabeth
device
daughter
nor
jennet
sister
nor
any
relation
of
theirs
we
are
sure
of
it
and
we
will
have
you
of
our
mind
the
fair
and
animated
speaker
could
not
help
noticing
the
blushes
that
mantled
alizon
cheeks
as
she
spoke
but
she
attributed
them
to
other
than
the
true
cause
nor
did
she
mend
the
matter
as
she
proceeded
i
am
sure
you
are
well
born
alizon
she
said
and
so
it
will
be
found
in
the
end
and
richard
thinks
so
too
for
he
said
so
to
me
and
richard
is
my
oracle
alizon
in
spite
of
herself
alizon
eyes
sparkled
with
pleasure
but
she
speedily
checked
the
emotion
i
must
not
indulge
the
dream
she
said
with
a
sigh
why
not
cried
dorothy
i
will
have
strict
inquiries
made
as
to
your
history
i
can
not
consent
to
it
replied
alizon
i
can
not
leave
one
who
if
she
be
not
my
parent
has
stood
to
me
in
that
relation
neither
can
i
have
her
brought
into
trouble
on
my
account
what
will
she
think
of
me
if
she
learns
i
have
indulged
such
a
notion
she
will
say
and
with
truth
that
i
am
the
most
ungrateful
of
human
beings
as
well
as
the
most
unnatural
of
children
no
dear
young
lady
it
must
not
be
these
fancies
are
brilliant
but
fallacious
and
like
bubbles
burst
as
soon
as
formed
i
admire
your
sentiments
though
i
do
not
admit
the
justice
of
your
reasoning
rejoined
dorothy
it
is
not
on
your
own
account
merely
though
that
is
much
that
the
secret
of
your
birth
if
there
be
one
ought
to
be
cleared
up
but
for
the
sake
of
those
with
whom
you
may
be
connected
there
may
be
a
mother
like
mine
weeping
for
you
as
lost
a
brother
like
richard
mourning
you
as
dead
think
of
the
sad
hearts
your
restoration
will
make
joyful
as
to
elizabeth
device
no
consideration
should
be
shown
her
if
she
has
stolen
you
from
your
parents
as
i
suspect
she
deserves
no
pity
all
this
is
mere
surmise
dear
young
lady
replied
alizon
at
this
juncture
they
were
startled
by
seeing
an
old
woman
come
from
behind
the
monument
and
plant
herself
before
them
both
uttered
a
cry
and
would
have
fled
but
a
gesture
from
the
crone
detained
them
very
old
was
she
and
of
strange
and
sinister
aspect
almost
blind
bent
double
with
frosted
brows
and
chin
and
shaking
with
palsy
stay
where
you
are
cried
the
hag
in
an
imperious
tone
i
want
to
speak
to
you
come
nearer
to
me
my
pretty
wheans
nearer
nearer
and
as
they
complied
drawn
towards
her
by
an
impulse
they
could
not
resist
the
old
woman
caught
hold
of
alizon
arm
and
said
with
a
chuckle
so
you
are
the
wench
they
call
alizon
device
eh
ay
replied
alizon
trembling
like
a
dove
in
the
talons
of
a
hawk
do
you
know
who
i
am
cried
the
hag
grasping
her
yet
more
tightly
do
you
know
who
i
am
i
say
if
not
i
will
tell
you
i
am
mother
chattox
of
pendle
forest
the
rival
of
mother
demdike
and
the
enemy
of
all
her
accursed
brood
now
do
you
know
me
wench
men
call
me
witch
whether
i
am
so
or
not
i
have
some
power
as
they
and
you
shall
find
mother
demdike
has
often
defied
me
often
injured
me
but
i
will
have
my
revenge
upon
her
ha
ha
let
me
go
cried
alizon
greatly
terrified
i
will
run
and
bring
assistance
cried
dorothy
and
she
flew
to
the
door
but
it
resisted
her
attempts
to
open
it
come
back
screamed
the
hag
you
strive
in
vain
the
door
is
fast
shut
fast
shut
come
back
i
say
who
are
you
she
added
as
the
maid
drew
near
ready
to
sink
with
terror
your
voice
is
an
voice
i
know
you
now
you
are
dorothy
assheton
dorothy
listen
to
me
dorothy
i
owe
your
family
a
grudge
and
if
you
provoke
me
i
will
pay
it
off
in
part
on
you
stir
not
as
you
value
your
life
the
poor
girl
did
not
dare
to
move
and
alizon
remained
as
if
fascinated
by
the
terrible
old
woman
i
will
tell
you
what
has
happened
dorothy
pursued

to

of
my

meddling
with

dorothy

shrieked
alizon
how
this
exclaimed
mother
chattox
placing
her
hand
on
the
beating
heart
of
the
girl
what
of
richard
assheton
repeated
alizon

fierce
exultation

and
betray
its
secrets

tell

ruin
and
despair

implored
alizon
not
yet
replied
the
inexorable
old
woman
not
yet
my
tale
is
not
half
told
my
curse
fell
on
richard
head
as
it
did
on
nicholas
and
then
the
thought
to
catch
me
but
they
were
at
fault
i
tricked
them
nicely
ha
ha
however
they
took
my
nance
my
pretty
nance
they
seized
her
bound
her
bore
her
to
the
calder
and
there
swam
her
curses
light
on
them
all
all
but
chief
on
him
who
did
it
who
was
he
inquired
alizon
tremblingly
jem
device
replied
the
old
woman
it
was
he
who
bound
her
he
who
plunged
her
in
the
river
he
who
swam
her
but
i
will
pinch
and
plague
him
for
it
i
will
strew
his
couch
with
nettles
and
all
wholesome
food
shall
be
poison
to
him
his
blood
shall
be
as
water
and
his
flesh
shrink
from
his
bones
he
shall
waste
away
slowly
slowly
slowly
till
he
drops
like
a
skeleton
into
the
grave
ready
digged
for
him
all
connected
with
him
shall
feel
my
fury
i
would
kill
thee
now
if
thou
wert
aught
of
his
aught
of
his
what
mean
you
old
woman
demanded
alizon
why
this
rejoined
mother
chattox
and
let
the
knowledge
work
in
thee
to
the
confusion
of
bess
device
thou
art
not
her
daughter
it
is
as
i
thought
cried
dorothy
assheton
roused
by
the
intelligence
from
her
terror
i
tell
thee
not
this
secret
to
pleasure
thee
continued
mother
chattox
but
to
confound
elizabeth
device
i
have
no
other
motive
she
hath
provoked
my
vengeance
and
she
shall
feel
it
thou
art
not
her
child
i
say
the
secret
of
thy
birth
is
known
to
me
but
the
time
is
not
yet
come
for
its
disclosure
it
shall
out
one
day
to
the
confusion
of
those
who
offend
me
when
thou
goest
home
tell
thy
reputed
mother
what
i
have
said
and
mark
how
she
takes
the
information
ha
who
comes
here
the
hag
last
exclamation
was
occasioned
by
the
sudden
appearance
of
mistress
nutter
who
opened
the
door
of
the
chapel
and
staring
in
astonishment
at
the
group
came
quickly
forward
what
makes
you
here
mother
chattox
she
cried
i
came
here
to
avoid
pursuit
replied
the
old
hag
with
a
cowed
manner
and
in
accents
sounding
strangely
submissive
after
her
late
infuriated
tone
what
have
you
been
saying
to
these
girls
demanded
mistress
nutter
authoritatively
ask
them
the
hag
replied
she
declares
that
alizon
is
not
the
daughter
of
elizabeth
device
cried
dorothy
assheton
indeed
exclaimed
mistress
nutter
quickly
and
as
if
a
spring
of
extraordinary
interest
had
been
suddenly
touched
what
reason
hast
thou
for
this
assertion
no
good
reason
replied
the
old
woman
evasively
yet
with
evident
apprehension
of
her
questioner
good
reason
or
bad
i
will
have
it
cried
mistress
nutter
what
you
too
take
an
interest
in
the
wench
like
the
rest
returned
mother
chattox
is
she
so
very
winning
that
is
no
answer
to
my
question
said
the
lady
whose
child
is
she
ask
bess
device
or
mother
demdike
replied
mother
chattox
they
know
more
about
the
matter
than
me
i
will
have
thee
speak
and
to
the
purpose
cried
the
lady
angrily
many
an
one
has
lost
a
child
who
would
gladly
have
it
back
again
said
the
old
hag
mysteriously
who
has
lost
one
asked
mistress
nutter
nay
it
passeth
me
to
tell
replied
the
old
woman
with
affected
ignorance
question
those
who
stole
her
i
have
set
you
on
the
track
if
you
fail
in
pursuing
it
come
to
me
you
know
where
to
find
me
you
shall
not
go
thus
said
mistress
nutter
i
will
have
a
direct
answer
now
and
as
she
spoke
she
waved
her
hands
twice
or
thrice
over
the
old
woman
in
doing
this
her
figure
seemed
to
dilate
and
her
countenance
underwent
a
marked
and
fearful
change
all
her
beauty
vanished
her
eyes
blazed
and
terror
sat
on
her
wrinkled
brow
the
hag
on
the
contrary
crouched
lower
down
and
seemed
to
dwindle
less
than
her
ordinary
size
writhing
as
from
heavy
blows
and
with
a
mixture
of
malice
and
fear
in
her
countenance
she
cried
were
i
to
speak
you
would
not
thank
me
let
me
go
answer
vociferated
mistress
nutter
disregarding
the
caution
and
speaking
in
a
sharp
piercing
voice
strangely
contrasting
with
her
ordinary
utterance
answer
i
say
or
i
will
beat
thee
to
the
dust
and
she
continued
her
gestures
while
the
sufferings
of
the
old
hag
evidently
increased
and
she
crouched
nearer
and
nearer
to
the
ground
moaning
out
the
words
do
not
force
me
to
speak
you
will
repent
it
you
will
repent
it
do
not
torment
her
thus
madam
cried
alizon
who
with
dorothy
looked
at
the
strange
scene
with
mingled
apprehension
and
wonderment
much
as
i
desire
to
know
the
secret
of
my
birth
i
would
not
obtain
it
thus
as
she
uttered
these
words
the
old
woman
contrived
to
shuffle
off
and
disappeared
behind
the
tomb
why
did
you
interpose
alizon
cried
mistress
nutter
somewhat
angrily
and
dropping
her
hands
you
broke
the
power
i
had
over
her
i
would
have
compelled
her
to
speak
i
thank
you
gracious
lady
for
your
consideration
replied
alizon
gratefully
but
the
sight
was
too
painful
what
has
become
of
her
where
is
she
gone
cried
dorothy
peeping
behind
the
tomb
she
has
crept
into
this
vault
i
suppose
do
not
trouble
yourelf
about
her
more
dorothy
said
mistress
nutter
resuming
her
wonted
voice
and
wonted
looks
let
us
return
to
the
house
thus
much
is
ascertained
alizon
that
you
are
no
child
of
your
supposed
parent
wait
a
little
and
the
rest
shall
be
found
out
for
you
and
meantime
be
assured
that
i
take
strong
interest
in
you
that
we
all
do
added
dorothy
thank
you
thank
you
exclaimed
alizon
almost
overpowered
with
this
they
went
forth
and
traversing
the
shafted
aisle
quitted
the
conventual
church
and
took
their
way
along
the
alley
leading
to
the
garden
say
not
a
word
at
present
to
elizabeth
device
of
the
information
you
have
obtained
alizon
observed
mistress
nutter
i
have
reasons
for
this
counsel
which
i
will
afterwards
explain
to
you
and
do
you
keep
silence
on
the
subject
dorothy
may
i
not
tell
richard
said
the
young
lady
not
richard
not
any
one
returned
mistress
nutter
or
you
may
seriously
affect
alizon
prospects
you
have
cautioned
me
in
time
cried
dorothy
for
here
comes
my
brother
with
our
cousin
nicholas
and
as
she
spoke
a
turn
in
the
alley
showed
richard
and
nicholas
assheton
advancing
towards
them
a
strange
revolution
had
been
produced
in
alizon
feelings
by
the
events
of
the
last
half
hour
the
opinions
expressed
by
dorothy
assheton
as
to
her
birth
had
been
singularly
confirmed
by
mother
chattox
but
could
reliance
be
placed
on
the
old
woman
assertions
might
they
not
have
been
made
with
mischievous
intent
and
was
it
not
possible
nay
probable
that
in
her
place
of
concealment
behind
the
tomb
the
vindictive
hag
had
overheard
the
previous
conversation
with
dorothy
and
based
her
own
declaration
upon
it
all
these
suggestions
occurred
to
alizon
but
the
previous
idea
having
once
gained
admission
to
her
breast
soon
established
itself
firmly
there
in
spite
of
doubts
and
misgivings
and
began
to
mix
itself
up
with
new
thoughts
and
wishes
with
which
other
persons
were
connected
for
she
could
not
help
fancying
she
might
be
and
if
so
the
vast
distance
heretofore
existing
between
her
and
richard
assheton
might
be
greatly
diminished
if
not
altogether
removed
so
rapid
is
the
progress
of
thought
that
only
a
few
minutes
were
required
for
this
long
train
of
reflections
to
pass
through
her
mind
and
it
was
merely
put
to
flight
by
the
approach
of
the
main
object
of
her
thoughts
on
joining
the
party
richard
assheton
saw
plainly
that
something
had
happened
but
as
both
his
sister
and
alizon
laboured
under
evident
embarrassment
he
abstained
from
making
inquiries
as
to
its
cause
for
the
present
hoping
a
better
opportunity
of
doing
so
would
occur
and
the
conversation
was
kept
up
by
nicholas
assheton
who
described
in
his
wonted
lively
manner
the
encounter
with
mother
chattox
and
nance
redferne
the
swimming
of
the
latter
and
the
trickery
and
punishment
of
potts
during
the
recital
mistress
nutter
often
glanced
uneasily
at
the
two
girls
but
neither
of
them
offered
any
interruption
until
nicholas
had
finished
when
dorothy
taking
her
brother
hand
said
with
a
look
of
affectionate
admiration
you
acted
like
yourself
dear
richard
alizon
did
not
venture
to
give
utterance
to
the
same
sentiment
but
her
looks
plainly
expressed
it
i
only
wish
you
had
punished
that
cruel
james
device
as
well
as
saved
poor
nance
added
dorothy
hush
exclaimed
richard
glancing
at
alizon
you
need
not
be
afraid
of
hurting
her
feelings
cried
the
young
lady
she
does
not
mind
him
now
what
do
you
mean
dorothy
cried
richard
in
surprise
oh
nothing
nothing
she
replied
hastily
perhaps
you
will
explain
said
richard
to
alizon
indeed
i
can
not
she
answered
in
confusion
you
would
have
laughed
to
see
potts
creep
out
of
the
river
said
nicholas
turning
to
dorothy
he
looked
just
like
a
drowned
rat
ha
ha
you
have
made
a
bitter
enemy
of
him
nicholas
observed
mistress
nutter
so
look
well
to
yourself
i
heed
him
not
rejoined
the
squire
he
knows
me
now
too
well
to
meddle
with
me
again
and
i
shall
take
good
care
how
i
put
myself
in
his
power
one
thing
i
may
mention
to
show
the
impotent
malice
of
the
knave
just
as
he
was
setting
off
he
said
is
not
the
only
discovery
of
witchcraft
i
have
made
i
have
another
case
nearer
home
what
could
he
mean
i
know
not
replied
mistress
nutter
a
shade
of
disquietude
passing
over
her
countenance
but
he
is
quite
capable
of
bringing
the
charge
against
you
or
any
of
us
he
is
so
said
nicholas
after
what
has
occurred
i
wonder
whether
he
will
go
over
to
rough
lee
very
likely
not
replied
mistress
nutter
and
in
that
case
master
roger
nowell
must
provide
some
other
person
competent
to
examine
the
of
the
properties
on
his
behalf
then
you
are
confident
of
the
adjudication
being
in
your
favour
said
nicholas
quite
so
replied
mistress
nutter
with
a
smile
the
result
i
hope
may
justify
your
expectation
said
nicholas
but
it
is
right
to
tell
you
that
sir
ralph
in
consenting
to
postpone
his
decision
has
only
done
so
out
of
consideration
to
you
if
the
division
of
the
properties
be
as
represented
by
him
master
nowell
will
unquestionably
obtain
an
award
in
his
favour
under
such
circumstances
he
may
said
mistress
nutter
but
you
will
find
the
contrary
turn
out
to
be
the
fact
i
will
show
you
a
plan
i
have
had
lately
prepared
and
you
can
then
judge
for
yourself
while
thus
conversing
the
party
passed
through
a
door
in
the
high
stone
wall
dividing
the
garden
from
the
court
and
proceeded
towards
the
principal
entrance
of
the
mansion
built
out
of
the
ruins
of
the
abbey
which
had
served
as
a
very
convenient
quarry
for
the
construction
of
this
edifice
as
well
as
for
portfield
the
house
was
large
and
irregular
planned
chiefly
with
the
view
of
embodying
part
of
the
old
abbot
lodging
and
consisting
of
a
wide
front
with
two
wings
one
of
which
looked
into
the
court
and
the
other
comprehending
the
long
gallery
into
the
garden
the
old
gate
of
the
abbey
with
its
lofty
archway
and
embattled
walls
served
as
an
entrance
to
the
great
and
at
its
wicket
ordinarily
stood
ned
huddlestone
the
porter
though
he
was
absent
on
the
present
occasion
being
occupied
with
the
festivities
immediately
opposite
the
gateway
sprang
a
flight
of
stone
steps
with
a
double
and
a
broad
balustrade
of
the
same
material
on
the
lowest
pillar
of
which
was
placed
a
large
escutcheon
sculptured
with
the
arms
of
the
family
argent
a
mullet
sable
with
a
rebus
on
the
name
an
ash
on
a
tun
the
great
door
to
which
these
steps
conducted
stood
wide
open
and
before
it
on
the
upper
were
collected
lady
assheton
mistress
braddyll
mistress
nicholas
assheton
and
some
other
dames
laughing
and
conversing
together
some
spaniels
favourites
of
the
lady
of
the
house
were
chasing
each
other
up
and
down
the
steps
disturbing
the
slumbers
of
a
couple
of
fine
in
the
or
persecuting
the
proud
peafowl
that
strutted
about
to
display
their
gorgeous
plumage
to
the
spectators
on
seeing
the
party
approach
lady
assheton
came
down
to
meet
them
you
have
been
long
absent
she
said
to
dorothy
but
i
suppose
you
have
been
exploring
the
ruins
yes
we
have
not
left
a
hole
or
corner
unvisited
was
the
reply
that
is
right
said
lady
assheton
i
knew
you
would
make
a
good
guide
dorothy
of
course
you
have
often
seen
the
old
conventual
church
before
alizon
i
am
ashamed
to
say
i
have
not
your
ladyship
she
replied
indeed
exclaimed
lady
assheton
and
yet
you
have
lived
all
your
life
in
the
village
quite
true
your
ladyship
answered
alizon
but
these
ruins
have
been
prohibited
to
me
not
by
us
said
lady
assheton
they
are
open
to
every
one
i
was
forbidden
to
visit
them
by
my
mother
said
alizon
and
for
the
first
time
the
word
mother
seemed
strange
to
her
lady
assheton
looked
surprised
but
made
no
remark
and
mounting
the
steps
led
the
way
to
a
spacious
though
not
very
lofty
chamber
with
huge
uncovered
rafters
and
a
floor
of
polished
oak
over
a
great
fireplace
at
one
side
furnished
with
immense
andirons
hung
a
noble
pair
of
antlers
and
similar
trophies
of
the
chase
were
affixed
to
other
parts
of
the
walls
here
and
there
were
likewise
hung
rusty
breastplates
and
swords
maces
halberts
and
arquebusses
with
matchlocks
and
other
warlike
implements
amongst
which
were
several
shields
painted
with
the
arms
of
the
asshetons
and
their
alliances
chairs
of
gilt
leather
were
ranged
against
the
walls
and
ebony
cabinets
inlaid
with
ivory
were
set
between
them
at
intervals
supporting
rare
specimens
of
glass
and
earthenware
opposite
the
fireplace
stood
a
large
clock
curiously
painted
and
decorated
with
emblematical
devices
with
the
signs
of
the
zodiac
and
provided
with
movable
figures
to
strike
the
hours
on
a
bell
while
from
the
centre
of
the
roof
hung
a
great
chandelier
of
stag
horn
lady
assheton
did
not
tarry
long
within
the
entrance
hall
for
such
it
was
but
conducted
her
guests
through
an
arched
doorway
on
the
right
into
the
long
gallery
one
hundred
and
fifty
feet
in
length
and
proportionately
wide
and
lofty
this
vast
chamber
had
undergone
little
change
since
its
original
construction
by
the
old
owners
of
the
abbey
panelled
and
floored
with
lustrous
oak
and
hung
in
some
parts
with
antique
tapestry
representing
scriptural
subjects
one
side
was
pierced
with
lofty
pointed
windows
looking
out
upon
the
garden
while
the
southern
extremity
boasted
a
magnificent
window
with
heavy
stone
mullions
though
of
more
recent
workmanship
than
the
framework
commanding
whalley
nab
and
the
river
the
furniture
of
the
apartment
was
grand
but
gloomy
and
consisted
of
antique
chairs
and
tables
belonging
to
the
abbey
some
curious
ecclesiastical
sculptures
wood
carvings
and
saintly
images
were
placed
at
intervals
near
the
walls
and
on
the
upper
panels
were
hung
a
row
of
family
portraits
quitting
the
rest
of
the
company
and
proceeding
to
the
southern
window
dorothy
invited
alizon
and
her
brother
to
place
themselves
beside
her
on
the
cushioned
seats
of
the
deep
embrasure
little
conversation
however
ensued
alizon
heart
being
too
full
for
utterance
and
recent
occurrences
engrossing
dorothy
thoughts
to
the
exclusion
of
every
thing
else
having
made
one
or
two
unsuccessful
efforts
to
engage
them
in
talk
richard
likewise
lapsed
into
silence
and
gazed
out
on
the
lovely
scenery
before
him
the
evening
has
been
described
as
beautiful
and
the
swift
calder
as
it
hurried
by
was
tinged
with
rays
of
the
declining
sun
whilst
the
woody
heights
of
whalley
nab
were
steeped
in
the
same
rosy
light
but
the
view
failed
to
interest
richard
in
his
present
mood
and
after
a
brief
survey
he
stole
a
look
at
alizon
and
was
surprised
to
find
her
in
tears
what
saddening
thoughts
cross
you
fair
girl
he
inquired
with
deep
interest
i
can
hardly
account
for
my
sudden
despondency
she
replied
but
i
have
heard
that
great
happiness
is
the
precursor
of
dejection
and
the
saying
i
suppose
must
be
true
for
i
have
been
happier
than
i
ever
was
before
in
my
life
but
the
feeling
of
sadness
is
now
past
she
added
smiling
i
am
glad
of
it
said
richard
may
i
not
know
what
has
occurred
to
you
not
at
present
interposed
dorothy
but
i
am
sure
you
will
be
pleased
when
you
are
made
acquainted
with
the
circumstance
i
would
tell
you
now
if
i
might
may
i
guess
said
richard
i
do
know
rejoined
dorothy
who
was
dying
to
tell
him
may
he
oh
no
no
cried
alizon
you
are
very
perverse
said
richard
with
a
look
of
disappointment
there
can
be
no
harm
in
guessing
and
you
can
please
yourself
as
to
giving
an
answer
i
fancy
then
that
alizon
has
made
some
discovery
dorothy
nodded
relative
to
her
parentage
pursued
richard
another
nod
she
has
found
out
she
is
not
elizabeth
device
daughter
said
richard
some
witch
must
have
told
you
this
exclaimed
dorothy
have
i
indeed
guessed
rightly
cried
richard
with
an
eagerness
that
startled
his
sister
do
not
keep
me
in
suspense
speak
plainly
how
am
i
to
answer
him
alizon
said
dorothy
nay
do
not
appeal
to
me
dear
young
lady
she
answered
blushing
i
have
gone
too
far
to
retreat
rejoined
dorothy
and
therefore
despite
mistress
nutter
interdiction
the
truth
shall
out
you
have
guessed
shrewdly
richard
a
discovery
been
made
a
very
great
discovery
alizon
is
not
the
daughter
of
elizabeth
device
the
intelligence
delights
me
though
it
scarcely
surprises
me
cried
richard
gazing
with
heartfelt
pleasure
at
the
blushing
girl
for
i
was
sure
of
the
fact
from
the
first
nothing
so
good
and
charming
as
alizon
could
spring
from
so
foul
a
source
how
and
by
what
means
you
have
derived
this
information
as
well
as
whose
daughter
you
are
i
shall
wait
patiently
to
learn
enough
for
me
you
are
not
the
sister
of
james
device
enough
you
are
not
the
grandchild
of
mother
demdike
you
know
all
i
know
in
knowing
thus
much
replied
alizon
timidly
and
secrecy
has
been
enjoined
by
mistress
nutter
in
order
that
the
rest
may
be
found
out
but
oh
should
the
hopes
i
have
perhaps
too
hastily
indulged
prove
fallacious
they
can
not
be
fallacious
alizon
interrupted
richard
eagerly
on
that
score
rest
easy
your
connexion
with
that
wretched
family
is
for
ever
broken
but
i
can
see
the
necessity
of
caution
and
shall
observe
it
and
so
mistress
nutter
takes
an
interest
in
you
the
strongest
replied
dorothy
but
see
she
comes
this
way
but
we
must
now
go
back
for
a
short
space
while
mistress
nutter
and
nicholas
were
seated
at
a
table
examining
a
plan
of
the
rough
lee
estates
the
latter
was
greatly
astonished
to
see
the
door
open
and
give
admittance
to
master
potts
who
he
fancied
snugly
lying
between
a
couple
of
blankets
at
the
dragon
the
attorney
was
clad
in
a
which
he
had
exchanged
for
his
wet
habiliments
and
was
accompanied
by
sir
ralph
assheton
and
master
roger
nowell
on
seeing
nicholas
he
instantly
stepped
up
to
him
aha
squire
he
cried
you
did
not
expect
to
see
me
again
so
soon
eh
a
pottle
of
hot
sack
put
my
blood
into
circulation
and
having
luckily
a
change
of
raiment
in
my
valise
i
am
all
right
again
not
so
easily
got
rid
of
you
see
so
it
appears
replied
nicholas
laughing
we
have
a
trifling
account
to
settle
together
sir
said
the
attorney
putting
on
a
serious
look
whenever
you
please
sir
replied
nicholas
tapping
the
hilt
of
his
sword
not
in
that
way
cried
potts
darting
quickly
back
i
never
fight
with
those
weapons
never
our
dispute
must
be
settled
in
a
court
of
law
sir
in
a
court
of
law
you
understand
master
nicholas
there
is
a
shrewd
maxim
master
potts
that
he
who
is
his
own
lawyer
has
a
fool
for
his
client
observed
nicholas
drily
would
it
not
be
better
to
stick
to
the
defence
of
others
rather
than
practise
in
your
own
behalf
you
have
expressed
my
opinion
master
nicholas
observed
roger
nowell
and
i
hope
master
potts
will
not
commence
any
action
on
his
own
account
till
he
has
finished
my
business
assuredly
not
sir
since
you
desire
it
replied
the
attorney
obsequiously
but
my
motives
must
not
be
mistaken
i
have
a
clear
case
of
assault
and
battery
against
master
nicholas
assheton
or
i
may
proceed
against
him
criminally
for
an
attempt
on
my
life
have
you
given
him
no
provocation
sir
demanded
sir
ralph
sternly
no
provocation
can
justify
the
treatment
i
have
experienced
sir
ralph
replied
potts
however
to
show
i
am
a
man
of
peace
and
harbour
no
resentment
however
just
grounds
i
may
have
for
such
a
feeling
i
am
willing
to
make
up
the
matter
with
master
nicholas
provided
he
offers
you
a
handsome
consideration
eh
said
the
squire
provided
he
offers
me
a
handsome
apology
such
as
a
gentleman
may
accept
rejoined
potts
consequentially
and
which
he
will
not
refuse
i
am
sure
said
sir
ralph
glancing
at
his
cousin
i
should
certainly
be
sorry
to
have
drowned
you
said
the
squire
very
sorry
enough
enough
i
am
content
cried
potts
holding
out
his
hand
which
nicholas
grasped
with
an
energy
that
brought
tears
into
the
little
eyes
i
am
glad
the
matter
is
amicably
adjusted
observed
roger
nowell
for
i
suspect
both
parties
have
been
to
blame
and
i
must
now
request
you
master
potts
to
forego
your
search
and
inquiries
after
witches
till
such
time
as
you
have
settled
this
question
of
the
boundary
line
for
me
one
matter
at
a
time
my
good
sir
but
master
nowell
cried
potts
my
much
esteemed
and
singular
good
client
i
will
have
no
nay
interrupted
nowell
peremptorily
hum
muttered
potts
i
shall
lose
the
best
chance
of
distinction
ever
thrown
in
my
way
i
care
not
said
nowell
just
as
you
came
up
master
nowell
observed
nicholas
i
was
examining
a
plan
of
the
disputed
estates
in
pendle
forest
it
differs
from
yours
and
if
correct
certainly
substantiates
mistress
claim
i
have
mine
with
me
replied
nowell
producing
a
plan
and
opening
it
we
can
compare
the
two
if
you
please
the
line
runs
thus
from
the
foot
of
pendle
hill
beginning
with
barley
booth
the
boundary
is
marked
by
a
stone
wall
as
far
as
certain
fields
in
the
occupation
of
john
ogden
is
it
not
so
it
is
replied
nicholas
comparing
the
statement
with
the
other
plan
it
then
runs
on
in
a
northerly
direction
pursued
nowell
towards
burst
clough
and
here
the
landmarks
are
certain
stones
placed
in
the
moor
one
hundred
yards
apart
and
giving
me
twenty
acres
of
this
land
and
mistress
nutter
ten
on
the
contrary
replied
nicholas
this
plan
gives
mistress
nutter
twenty
acres
and
you
ten
then
the
plan
is
wrong
cried
nowell
sharply
it
has
been
carefully
prepared
said
mistress
nutter
who
had
approached
the
table
no
matter
it
is
wrong
i
say
cried
nowell
angrily
you
see
where
the
landmarks
are
placed
master
nowell
said
nicholas
pointing
to
the
measurement
i
merely
go
by
them
the
landmarks
are
improperly
placed
in
that
plan
cried
nowell
i
will
examine
them
myself
said
potts
taking
out
a
large
there
can
not
be
an
error
of
ten
acres
ten
perches
or
ten
feet
possibly
but
acres
pshaw
laugh
as
you
please
but
go
on
said
nutter
well
then
pursued
nicholas
the
line
approaches
the
bank
of
a
rivulet
called
moss
brook
a
rare
place
for
woodcocks
and
snipes
that
moss
brook
i
may
remark
the
land
on
the
left
consisting
of
five
acres
of
waste
land
marked
by
a
sheepfold
and
two
posts
set
up
in
a
line
with
it
belonging
to
mistress
nutter
to
mistress
nutter
exclaimed
nowell
indignantly
to
me
you
mean
it
is
here
set
down
to
mistress
nutter
said
nicholas
then
it
is
set
down
wrongfully
cried
nowell
that
plan
is
altogether
incorrect
on
which
side
of
the
field
does
the
rivulet
flow
inquired
potts
on
the
right
replied
nicholas
on
the
left
cried
nowell
there
must
be
some
extraordinary
mistake
said
potts
i
shall
make
a
note
of
that
and
examine
it
waste
land
sheepfold
rivulet
called
moss
brook
flowing
on
the
left
on
the
right
cried
mistress
nutter
that
remains
to
be
seen
rejoined
potts
i
have
made
the
entry
as
on
the
left
go
on
master
nicholas
said
nowell
i
should
like
to
see
how
many
other
errors
that
plan
contains
passing
the
rivulet
pursued
the
squire
we
come
to
a
footpath
leading
to
the
limestone
quarry
about
which
there
can
be
no
mistake
then
by
cat
gallows
wood
and
swallow
hole
and
then
by
another
path
to
worston
moor
skirting
a
hut
in
the
occupation
of
james
device
ha
ha
master
jem
are
you
here
i
thought
you
dwelt
with
your
grandmother
at
malkin
tower
excuse
me
master
nowell
but
one
must
relieve
the
dulness
of
this
plan
by
an
exclamation
or
so
and
here
being
waste
land
again
the
landmarks
are
certain
stones
set
at
intervals
towards
hook
cliff
and
giving
mistress
nutter
of
the
whole
moor
and
master
roger
nowell
false
again
cried
nowell
furiously
the
are
mine
the
mistress
nutter
somebody
must
be
very
wrong
cried
nicholas
very
wrong
indeed
added
potts
and
i
suspect
that
that
somebody
is
master
nowell
said
mistress
nutter
mistress
nutter
cried
master
nowell
both
are
wrong
and
both
right
according
to
your
own
showing
said
nicholas
laughing
will
decide
the
question
said
potts
better
wait
till
then
interposed
sir
ralph
take
both
plans
with
you
and
you
will
then
ascertain
which
is
correct
agreed
cried
nowell
here
is
mine
and
here
is
mine
said
mistress
nutter
i
will
abide
by
the
investigation
and
master
potts
and
i
will
verify
the
statements
said
nicholas
we
will
sir
replied
the
attorney
putting
his
memorandum
book
in
his
pocket
we
will
the
plans
were
then
delivered
to
the
custody
of
sir
ralph
who
promised
to
hand
them
over
to
potts
and
nicholas
on
the
morrow
the
party
then
separated
mistress
nutter
shaping
her
course
towards
the
window
where
alizon
and
the
two
other
young
people
were
seated
while
potts
plucking
the
squire
sleeve
said
with
a
very
mysterious
look
that
he
desired
a
word
with
him
in
private
wondering
what
could
be
the
nature
of
the
communication
the
attorney
desired
to
make
nicholas
withdrew
with
him
into
a
corner
and
nowell
who
saw
them
retire
and
could
not
help
watching
them
with
some
curiosity
remarked
that
the
squire
hilarious
countenance
fell
as
he
listened
to
the
attorney
while
on
the
contrary
the
features
of
the
latter
gleamed
with
malicious
satisfaction
meanwhile
mistress
nutter
approached
alizon
and
beckoning
her
towards
her
they
quitted
the
room
together
as
the
young
girl
went
forth
she
cast
a
wistful
look
at
dorothy
and
her
brother
you
think
with
me
that
that
lovely
girl
is
well
born
said
dorothy
as
alizon
disappeared
it
were
heresy
to
doubt
it
answered
richard
shall
i
tell
you
another
secret
she
continued
regarding
him
fixedly
if
indeed
it
be
a
secret
for
you
must
be
sadly
wanting
in
discernment
if
you
have
not
found
it
out
ere
this
she
loves
you
dorothy
exclaimed
richard
i
am
sure
of
it
she
rejoined
but
i
would
not
tell
you
this
if
i
were
not
quite
equally
sure
that
you
love
her
in
return
on
my
faith
dorothy
you
give
yourself
credit
for
wonderful
penetration
cried
richard
not
a
whit
more
than
i
am
entitled
to
she
answered
nay
it
will
not
do
to
attempt
concealment
with
me
if
i
had
not
been
certain
of
the
matter
before
your
manner
now
would
convince
me
i
am
very
glad
of
it
she
will
make
a
charming
sister
and
i
shall
he
very
fond
of
her
how
you
do
run
on
madcap
cried
her
brother
trying
to
look
displeased
but
totally
failing
in
assuming
the
expression
stranger
things
have
come
to
pass
said
dorothy
and
one
reads
in
of
young
nobles
marrying
village
maidens
in
spite
of
parental
opposition
i
dare
say
you
will
get
nobody
consent
to
the
marriage
but
mine
richard
i
dare
say
not
he
replied
rather
blankly
that
is
if
she
should
not
turn
out
to
be
somebody
daughter
pursued
dorothy
somebody
i
mean
quite
as
great
as
the
heir
of
middleton
which
i
make
no
doubt
she
will
i
hope
she
may
replied
richard
why
you
do
mean
to
say
you
would
marry
her
if
she
did
cried
dorothy
i
ashamed
of
you
richard
it
would
remove
all
opposition
at
all
events
said
her
brother
so
it
would
said
dorothy
and
now
i
tell
you
another
notion
of
mine
richard
somehow
or
other
it
has
come
into
my
head
that
alizon
is
the
daughter
of
whom
do
you
think
whom
he
cried
guess
she
rejoined
i
ca
he
exclaimed
impatiently
well
then
i
tell
you
without
more
ado
she
answered
mind
only
my
notion
and
i
no
precise
grounds
for
it
but
in
my
opinion
she
the
daughter
of
the
lady
who
has
just
left
the
room
of
mistress
nutter
ejaculated
richard
starting
what
makes
you
think
so
the
extraordinary
and
otherwise
unaccountable
interest
she
takes
in
her
replied
dorothy
and
if
you
recollect
mistress
nutter
had
an
infant
daughter
who
was
lost
in
a
strange
manner
i
thought
the
child
died
replied
richard
but
it
may
be
as
you
say
i
hope
it
is
so
time
will
show
said
dorothy
but
i
have
made
up
my
mind
about
the
matter
at
this
moment
nicholas
assheton
came
up
to
them
looking
grave
and
uneasy
what
has
happened
asked
richard
anxiously
i
have
just
received
some
very
unpleasant
intelligence
replied
nicholas
i
told
you
of
a
menace
uttered
by
that
confounded
potts
on
quitting
me
after
his
ducking
he
has
now
spoken
out
plainly
and
declares
he
overheard
part
of
a
conversation
between
mistress
nutter
and
elizabeth
device
which
took
place
in
the
ruins
of
the
convent
church
this
morning
and
he
is
satisfied
that
well
cried
richard
breathlessly
that
mistress
nutter
is
a
witch
and
in
league
with
witches
continued
nicholas
ha
exclaimed
richard
turning
deathly
pale
i
suspect
the
rascal
has
invented
the
charge
said
nicholas
but
he
is
quite
unscrupulous
enough
to
make
it
and
if
made
it
will
be
fatal
to
our
relative
reputation
if
not
to
her
life
it
is
false
i
am
sure
of
it
cried
richard
torn
by
conflicting
emotions
would
i
could
think
so
cried
dorothy
suddenly
recollecting
mistress
nutter
strange
demeanour
in
the
little
chapel
and
the
unaccountable
influence
she
seemed
to
exercise
over
the
old
crone
but
something
has
occurred
that
leads
me
to
a
contrary
conviction
what
is
it
speak
cried
richard
not
now
not
now
replied
dorothy
whatever
suspicions
you
may
entertain
keep
silence
or
you
will
destroy
mistress
nutter
said
nicholas
fear
me
not
rejoined
dorothy
oh
alizon
she
murmured
that
this
unhappy
question
should
arise
at
such
a
moment
do
you
indeed
believe
the
charge
dorothy
asked
richard
in
a
low
voice
i
do
she
answered
in
the
same
tone
if
alizon
be
her
daughter
she
can
never
be
your
wife
how
cried
richard
never
never
repeated
dorothy
emphatically
the
daughter
of
a
witch
be
that
witch
named
elizabeth
device
or
alice
nutter
is
no
mate
for
you
you
prejudge
mistress
nutter
dorothy
he
cried
alas
richard
i
have
too
good
reason
for
what
i
say
she
answered
sadly
richard
uttered
an
exclamation
of
despair
and
on
the
instant
the
lively
sounds
of
tabor
and
pipe
mixed
with
the
jingling
of
bells
arose
from
the
and
presently
afterwards
an
attendant
entered
to
announce
that
the
revellers
were
without
and
directions
were
given
by
sir
ralph
that
they
should
be
shown
into
the
great
below
the
gallery
which
had
been
prepared
for
their
reception
chapter
the
revelation
on
quitting
the
long
gallery
mistress
nutter
and
alizon
ascended
a
wide
staircase
and
traversing
a
corridor
came
to
an
antique
tapestried
chamber
richly
but
cumbrously
furnished
having
a
carved
oak
bedstead
with
sombre
hangings
a
few
chairs
of
the
same
material
and
a
massive
wardrobe
with
atop
and
two
finely
sculptured
figures
of
the
size
of
life
in
the
habits
of
cistertian
monks
placed
as
supporters
at
either
extremity
at
one
side
of
the
bed
the
tapestry
was
drawn
aside
showing
the
entrance
to
a
closet
or
inner
room
and
opposite
it
there
was
a
great
yawning
fireplace
with
a
lofty
mantelpiece
and
chimney
projecting
beyond
the
walls
the
windows
were
narrow
and
darkened
by
heavy
transom
bars
and
small
diamond
panes
while
the
view
without
looking
upon
whalley
nab
was
obstructed
by
the
contiguity
of
a
tall
cypress
whose
funereal
branches
added
to
the
general
gloom
the
room
was
one
of
those
formerly
allotted
to
their
guests
by
the
hospitable
abbots
and
had
undergone
little
change
since
their
time
except
in
regard
to
furniture
and
even
that
appeared
old
and
faded
now
what
with
the
gloomy
arras
the
shrouded
bedstead
and
the
gothic
wardrobe
with
its
mysterious
figures
the
chamber
had
a
grim
ghostly
air
and
so
the
young
girl
thought
on
entering
it
i
have
brought
you
hither
alizon
said
mistress
nutter
motioning
her
to
a
seat
that
we
may
converse
without
chance
of
interruption
for
i
have
much
to
say
on
first
seeing
you
your
appearance
so
superior
to
the
rest
of
the
mummers
struck
me
forcibly
and
i
resolved
to
question
elizabeth
device
about
you
accordingly
i
bade
her
join
me
in
the
abbey
gardens
she
did
so
and
had
not
long
left
me
when
i
accidentally
met
you
and
the
others
in
the
lacy
chapel
when
questioned
elizabeth
affected
great
surprise
and
denied
positively
that
there
was
any
foundation
for
the
idea
that
you
were
other
than
her
child
but
notwithstanding
her
asseverations
i
could
see
from
her
confused
manner
that
there
was
more
in
the
notion
than
she
chose
to
admit
and
i
determined
to
have
recourse
to
other
means
of
arriving
at
the
truth
little
expecting
my
suspicions
would
be
so
soon
confirmed
by
mother
chattox
to
my
interrogation
of
that
old
woman
you
were
yourself
a
party
and
i
am
now
rejoiced
that
you
interfered
to
prevent
me
from
prosecuting
my
inquiries
to
the
utmost
there
was
one
present
from
whom
the
secret
of
your
birth
must
be
strictly
kept
at
least
for
awhile
and
my
impatience
carried
me
too
far
i
only
obeyed
a
natural
impulse
madam
said
alizon
but
i
am
at
a
loss
to
conceive
what
claim
i
can
possibly
have
to
the
consideration
you
show
me
listen
to
me
and
you
shall
learn
replied
mistress
nutter
it
is
a
sad
tale
and
its
recital
will
tear
open
old
wounds
but
it
must
not
be
withheld
on
that
account
i
do
not
ask
you
to
bury
the
secrets
i
am
about
to
impart
in
the
recesses
of
your
bosom
you
will
do
so
when
you
learn
them
without
my
telling
you
when
little
more
than
your
age
i
was
wedded
but
not
to
him
i
would
have
chosen
if
choice
had
been
permitted
me
the
union
i
need
scarcely
say
was
unhappy
most
unhappy
though
my
discomforts
were
scrupulously
concealed
and
i
was
looked
upon
as
a
devoted
wife
and
my
husband
as
a
model
of
conjugal
affection
but
this
was
merely
the
surface
internally
all
was
strife
and
misery
erelong
my
dislike
of
my
husband
increased
to
absolute
hate
while
on
his
part
though
he
still
regarded
me
with
as
much
passion
as
heretofore
he
became
frantically
jealous
and
above
all
of
edward
braddyll
of
portfield
who
as
his
bosom
friend
and
my
distant
relative
was
a
frequent
visiter
at
the
house
to
relate
the
numerous
exhibitions
of
jealousy
that
occurred
would
answer
little
purpose
and
it
will
be
enough
to
say
that
not
a
word
or
look
passed
between
edward
and
myself
but
was
misconstrued
i
took
care
never
to
be
alone
with
our
guest
nor
to
give
any
just
ground
for
suspicion
but
my
caution
availed
nothing
an
easy
remedy
would
have
been
to
forbid
edward
the
house
but
this
my
husband
pride
rejected
he
preferred
to
endure
the
jealous
torment
occasioned
by
the
presence
of
his
wife
fancied
lover
and
inflict
needless
anguish
on
her
rather
than
brook
the
jeers
of
a
few
indifferent
acquaintances
the
same
feeling
made
him
desire
to
keep
up
an
apparent
good
understanding
with
me
and
so
far
i
seconded
his
views
for
i
shared
in
his
pride
if
in
nothing
else
our
quarrels
were
all
in
private
when
no
eye
could
see
us
no
ear
listen
yours
is
a
melancholy
history
madam
remarked
alizon
in
a
tone
of
profound
interest
you
will
think
so
ere
i
have
done
returned
the
lady
sadly
the
only
person
in
my
confidence
and
aware
of
my
secret
sorrows
was
elizabeth
device
who
with
her
husband
john
device
then
lived
at
rough
lee
serving
me
in
the
quality
of
and
personal
attendant
she
could
not
be
kept
in
ignorance
of
what
took
place
and
the
poor
soul
offered
me
all
the
sympathy
in
her
power
much
was
it
needed
for
i
had
no
other
sympathy
after
awhile
i
know
not
from
what
cause
unless
from
some
imprudence
on
the
part
of
edward
braddyll
who
was
wild
and
reckless
my
husband
conceived
worse
suspicions
than
ever
of
me
and
began
to
treat
me
with
such
harshness
and
cruelty
that
unable
longer
to
endure
his
violence
i
appealed
to
my
father
but
he
was
of
a
stern
and
arbitrary
nature
and
having
forced
me
into
the
match
would
not
listen
to
my
complaints
but
bade
me
submit
was
my
duty
to
do
so
he
said
and
he
added
some
cutting
expressions
to
the
effect
that
i
deserved
the
treatment
i
experienced
and
dismissed
me
driven
to
desperation
i
sought
counsel
and
assistance
from
one
i
should
most
have
avoided
from
edward
braddyll
and
he
proposed
flight
from
my
roof
flight
with
him
but
you
were
saved
madam
cried
alizon
greatly
shocked
by
the
narration
you
were
saved
hear
me
out
rejoined
mistress
nutter
outraged
as
my
feelings
were
and
loathsome
as
my
husband
was
to
me
i
spurned
the
base
proposal
and
instantly
quitted
my
false
friend
nor
would
i
have
seen
him
more
if
permitted
but
that
secret
interview
with
him
was
my
first
and
last
for
it
had
been
witnessed
by
my
husband
ha
exclaimed
alizon
concealed
behind
the
arras
richard
nutter
heard
enough
to
confirm
his
worst
suspicions
pursued
the
lady
but
he
did
not
hear
my
justification
he
saw
edward
braddyll
at
my
feet
he
heard
him
urge
me
to
fly
but
he
did
not
wait
to
learn
if
i
consented
and
looking
upon
me
as
guilty
left
his
to
take
measures
for
frustrating
the
plan
he
supposed
concerted
between
us
that
night
i
was
made
prisoner
in
my
room
and
endured
treatment
the
most
inhuman
but
a
proposal
was
made
by
my
husband
that
promised
some
alleviation
of
my
suffering
henceforth
we
were
to
meet
only
in
public
when
a
semblance
of
affection
was
to
be
maintained
on
both
sides
this
was
done
he
said
to
save
my
character
and
preserve
his
own
name
unspotted
in
the
eyes
of
others
however
tarnished
it
might
be
in
his
own
i
willingly
consented
to
the
arrangement
and
thus
for
a
brief
space
i
became
tranquil
if
not
happy
but
another
and
severer
trial
awaited
me
alas
madam
exclaimed
alizon
sympathisingly
my
cup
of
sorrow
i
thought
was
full
pursued
mistress
nutter
but
the
drop
was
wanting
to
make
it
overflow
it
came
soon
enough
amidst
my
griefs
i
expected
to
be
a
mother
and
with
that
thought
how
many
fond
and
cheering
anticipations
mingled
in
my
child
i
hoped
to
find
a
balm
for
my
woes
in
its
smiles
and
innocent
endearments
a
compensation
for
the
harshness
and
injustice
i
had
experienced
how
little
did
i
foresee
that
it
was
to
be
a
new
instrument
of
torture
to
me
and
that
i
should
be
cruelly
robbed
of
the
only
blessing
ever
vouchsafed
me
did
the
child
die
madam
asked
alizon
you
shall
hear
replied
mistress
nutter
a
daughter
was
born
to
me
i
was
made
happy
by
its
birth
a
new
existence
bright
and
unclouded
seemed
dawning
upon
me
but
it
was
like
a
sunburst
on
a
stormy
day
some
two
months
before
this
event
elizabeth
device
had
given
birth
to
a
daughter
and
she
now
took
my
child
under
her
fostering
care
for
weakness
prevented
me
from
affording
it
the
support
it
is
a
blessed
privilege
to
bestow
she
seemed
as
fond
of
it
as
myself
and
never
was
babe
more
calculated
to
win
love
than
my
little
millicent
oh
how
shall
i
go
on
the
retrospect
i
am
compelled
to
take
is
frightful
but
i
can
not
shun
it
the
foul
and
false
suspicions
entertained
by
my
husband
began
to
settle
on
the
child
he
would
not
believe
it
to
be
his
own
with
violent
oaths
and
threats
he
first
announced
his
odious
suspicions
to
elizabeth
device
and
she
full
of
terror
communicated
them
to
me
the
tidings
filled
me
with
inexpressible
alarm
for
i
knew
if
the
dread
idea
had
once
taken
possession
of
him
it
would
never
be
removed
while
what
he
threatened
would
be
executed
i
would
have
fled
at
once
with
my
poor
babe
if
i
had
known
where
to
go
but
i
had
no
place
of
shelter
it
would
be
in
vain
to
seek
refuge
with
my
father
and
i
had
no
other
relative
or
friend
whom
i
could
trust
where
then
should
i
fly
at
last
i
bethought
me
of
a
retreat
and
arranged
a
plan
of
escape
with
elizabeth
device
vain
were
my
precautions
on
that
very
night
i
was
startled
from
slumber
by
a
sudden
cry
from
the
nurse
who
was
seated
by
the
fire
with
the
child
on
her
knees
it
was
long
past
midnight
and
all
the
household
were
at
rest
two
persons
had
entered
the
room
one
was
my
ruthless
husband
richard
nutter
the
other
was
john
device
a
powerful
ruffianly
fellow
who
planted
himself
near
the
door
marching
quickly
towards
elizabeth
who
had
arisen
on
seeing
him
my
husband
snatched
the
child
from
her
before
i
could
seize
it
and
with
a
violent
blow
on
the
chest
felled
me
to
the
ground
where
i
lay
helpless
speechless
with
reeling
senses
i
heard
elizabeth
cry
out
that
it
was
her
own
child
and
call
upon
her
husband
to
save
it
richard
nutter
paused
but
by
a
laugh
of
disbelief
from
his
ruffianly
follower
he
told
elizabeth
the
pitiful
excuse
would
not
avail
to
save
the
brat
and
then
i
saw
a
weapon
gleam
there
was
a
feeble
piteous
cry
a
cry
that
might
have
moved
a
demon
but
it
did
not
move
with
wicked
words
and
hands
he
cast
the
body
on
the
fire
the
horrid
sight
was
too
much
for
me
and
i
became
senseless
a
dreadful
tale
indeed
madam
cried
alizon
frozen
with
horror
the
crime
was
hidden
hidden
from
the
eyes
of
men
but
mark
the
retribution
that
followed
said
mistress
nutter
her
eyes
sparkling
with
vindictive
joy
of
the
two
murderers
both
perished
miserably
john
device
was
drowned
in
a
richard
nutter
end
was
terrible
sharpened
by
the
pangs
of
remorse
and
marked
by
frightful
suffering
but
another
dark
event
preceded
his
death
which
may
have
laid
a
crime
the
more
on
his
already
soul
edward
braddyll
the
object
of
his
jealousy
and
hate
suddenly
sickened
of
a
malady
so
strange
and
fearful
that
all
who
saw
him
affirmed
it
the
result
of
witchcraft
none
thought
of
my
husband
agency
in
the
dark
affair
except
myself
but
knowing
he
had
held
many
secret
conferences
about
the
time
with
mother
chattox
i
more
than
suspected
him
the
sick
man
died
and
from
that
hour
richard
nutter
knew
no
rest
ever
on
horseback
or
fiercely
carousing
he
sought
in
vain
to
stifle
remorse
visions
scared
him
by
night
and
vague
fears
pursued
him
by
day
he
would
start
at
shadows
and
talk
wildly
to
me
his
whole
demeanour
was
altered
and
he
strove
by
every
means
in
his
power
to
win
my
love
but
he
could
not
give
me
back
the
treasure
he
had
taken
he
could
not
bring
to
life
my
murdered
babe
like
his
victim
he
fell
ill
on
a
sudden
and
of
a
strange
and
terrible
sickness
i
saw
he
could
not
recover
and
therefore
tended
him
carefully
he
died
and
i
shed
no
tear
alas
exclaimed
alizon
though
guilty
i
can
not
but
compassionate
him
you
are
right
to
do
so
alizon
said
mistress
nutter
rising
while
the
young
girl
rose
too
for
he
was
your
father
my
father
she
exclaimed
in
amazement
then
you
are
my
mother
i
am
i
am
replied
mistress
nutter
straining
her
to
her
bosom
oh
my
child
my
dear
child
she
cried
the
voice
of
nature
from
the
first
pleaded
eloquently
in
your
behalf
and
i
should
have
been
deaf
to
all
impulses
of
affection
if
i
had
not
listened
to
the
call
i
now
trace
in
every
feature
the
lineaments
of
the
babe
i
thought
lost
for
ever
all
is
clear
to
me
the
exclamation
of
elizabeth
device
which
like
my
ruthless
husband
i
looked
upon
as
an
artifice
to
save
the
life
i
now
find
to
be
the
truth
her
child
perished
instead
of
mine
how
or
why
she
exchanged
the
infants
on
that
night
remains
to
be
explained
but
that
she
did
so
is
certain
while
that
she
should
afterwards
conceal
the
circumstance
is
easily
comprehended
from
a
natural
dread
of
her
own
husband
as
well
as
of
mine
it
is
possible
that
from
some
cause
she
may
still
deny
the
truth
but
i
can
make
it
her
interest
to
speak
plainly
the
main
difficulty
will
lie
in
my
public
acknowledgment
of
you
but
at
whatever
cost
it
shall
be
made
oh
consider
it
well
said
alizon
i
will
be
your
daughter
in
love
in
duty
in
all
but
name
but
sully
not
my
poor
father
honour
which
even
at
the
peril
of
his
soul
he
sought
to
maintain
how
can
i
be
owned
as
your
daughter
without
involving
the
discovery
of
this
tragic
history
you
are
right
alizon
rejoined
mistress
nutter
thoughtfully
it
will
bring
the
dark
deed
to
light
but
you
shall
never
return
to
elizabeth
device
you
shall
go
with
me
to
rough
lee
and
take
up
your
abode
in
the
house
where
i
was
once
so
wretched
but
where
i
shall
now
be
full
of
happiness
with
you
you
shall
see
the
dark
spots
on
the
hearth
which
i
took
to
be
your
blood
if
not
mine
it
was
blood
spilt
by
my
father
said
alizon
with
a
shudder
was
it
fancy
or
did
a
low
groan
break
upon
her
ear
it
must
be
imaginary
for
mistress
nutter
seemed
unconscious
of
the
dismal
sound
it
was
now
growing
rapidly
dark
and
the
more
distant
objects
in
the
room
were
wrapped
in
obscurity
but
alizon
gaze
rested
on
the
two
monkish
figures
supporting
the
wardrobe
look
there
mother
she
said
to
mistress
nutter
where
cried
the
lady
turning
round
quickly
ah
i
see
you
alarm
yourself
needlessly
my
child
those
are
only
carved
figures
of
two
brethren
of
the
abbey
they
are
said
i
know
not
with
what
truth
to
be
statues
of
john
paslew
and
borlace
alvetham
i
thought
they
stirred
said
alizon
it
was
mere
fancy
replied
mistress
nutter
calm
yourself
sweet
child
let
us
think
of
other
things
of
our
newly
discovered
relationship
henceforth
to
me
you
are
millicent
nutter
though
to
others
you
must
still
be
alizon
device
my
sweet
millicent
she
cried
embracing
her
again
and
again
ah
little
little
did
i
think
to
see
you
more
alizon
fears
were
speedily
chased
away
forgive
me
dear
mother
she
cried
if
i
have
failed
to
express
the
full
delight
i
experience
in
my
restitution
to
you
the
shock
of
your
sad
tale
at
first
deadened
my
joy
while
the
suddenness
of
the
information
respecting
myself
so
overwhelmed
me
that
like
one
chancing
upon
a
hidden
treasure
and
gazing
at
it
confounded
i
was
unable
to
credit
my
own
good
fortune
even
now
i
am
quite
bewildered
and
no
wonder
for
many
thoughts
each
of
different
import
throng
upon
me
independently
of
the
pleasure
and
natural
pride
i
must
feel
in
being
acknowledged
by
you
as
a
daughter
it
is
a
source
of
the
deepest
satisfaction
to
me
to
know
that
i
am
not
in
any
way
connected
with
elizabeth
device
not
from
her
humble
station
for
poverty
weighs
little
with
me
in
comparison
with
virtue
and
goodness
but
from
her
sinfulness
you
know
the
dark
offence
laid
to
her
charge
i
do
replied
mistress
nutter
in
a
low
deep
tone
but
i
do
not
believe
it
nor
i
returned
alizon
still
she
acts
as
if
she
were
the
wicked
thing
she
is
called
avoids
all
religious
offices
shuns
all
places
of
worship
and
derides
the
holy
scriptures
oh
mother
you
will
comprehend
the
frequent
conflict
of
feelings
i
must
have
endured
you
will
understand
my
horror
when
i
have
sometimes
thought
myself
the
daughter
of
a
witch
why
did
you
not
leave
her
if
you
thought
so
said
mistress
nutter
frowning
i
could
not
leave
her
replied
alizon
for
i
then
thought
her
my
mother
mistress
nutter
fell
upon
her
daughter
neck
and
wept
aloud
you
have
an
excellent
heart
my
child
she
said
at
length
checking
her
emotion
i
have
nothing
to
complain
of
in
elizabeth
device
dear
mother
she
replied
what
she
denied
herself
she
did
not
refuse
me
and
though
i
have
necessarily
many
and
great
deficiencies
you
will
find
in
me
i
trust
no
evil
principles
and
oh
shall
we
not
strive
to
rescue
that
poor
benighted
creature
from
the
pit
we
may
yet
save
her
it
is
too
late
replied
mistress
nutter
in
a
sombre
tone
it
can
not
be
too
late
said
alizon
confidently
she
can
not
be
beyond
redemption
but
even
if
she
should
prove
intractable
poor
little
jennet
may
be
preserved
she
is
yet
a
child
with
some
good
though
alas
much
evil
also
in
her
nature
let
our
united
efforts
be
exerted
in
this
good
work
and
we
must
succeed
the
weeds
extirpated
the
flowers
will
spring
up
freely
and
bloom
in
beauty
i
can
have
nothing
to
do
with
her
said
mistress
nutter
in
a
freezing
tone
nor
must
you
oh
say
not
so
mother
cried
alizon
you
rob
me
of
half
the
happiness
i
feel
in
being
restored
to
you
when
i
was
jennets
sister
i
devoted
myself
to
the
task
of
reclaiming
her
i
hoped
to
be
her
guardian
angel
to
step
between
her
and
the
assaults
of
evil
and
i
can
not
will
not
now
abandon
her
if
no
longer
my
sister
she
is
still
dear
to
me
and
recollect
that
i
owe
a
deep
debt
of
gratitude
to
her
mother
a
debt
i
can
never
pay
how
so
cried
mistress
nutter
you
owe
her
nothing
but
the
contrary
i
owe
her
a
life
said
alizon
was
not
her
infant
blood
poured
out
for
mine
and
shall
i
not
save
the
child
left
her
if
i
can
i
shall
not
oppose
your
inclinations
replied
mistress
nutter
with
reluctant
assent
but
elizabeth
i
suspect
will
thank
you
little
for
your
interference
not
now
perhaps
returned
alizon
but
a
time
will
come
when
she
will
do
so
while
this
conversation
took
place
it
had
been
rapidly
growing
dark
and
the
gloom
at
length
increased
so
much
that
the
speakers
could
scarcely
see
each
other
faces
the
sudden
and
portentous
darkness
was
accounted
for
by
a
vivid
flash
of
lightning
followed
by
a
low
growl
of
thunder
rumbling
over
whalley
nab
the
mother
and
daughter
drew
close
together
and
mistress
nutter
passed
her
arm
round
alizon
neck
the
storm
came
quickly
on
with
forked
and
dangerous
lightning
and
loud
claps
of
thunder
threatening
mischief
presently
all
its
fury
seemed
collected
over
the
abbey
the
red
flashes
hissed
and
the
peals
of
thunder
rolled
overhead
but
other
terrors
were
added
to
natural
dread
of
the
elemental
warfare
again
she
fancied
the
two
monkish
figures
which
had
before
excited
her
alarm
moved
and
even
shook
their
arms
menacingly
at
her
at
first
she
attributed
this
wild
idea
to
her
overwrought
imagination
and
strove
to
convince
herself
of
its
fallacy
by
keeping
her
eyes
steadily
fixed
upon
them
but
each
succeeding
flash
only
served
to
confirm
her
superstitious
apprehensions
another
circumstance
contributed
to
heighten
her
alarm
scared
most
probably
by
the
storm
a
large
white
owl
fluttered
down
the
chimney
and
after
wheeling
twice
or
thrice
round
the
chamber
settled
upon
the
bed
hooting
puffing
ruffling
its
feathers
and
glaring
at
her
with
eyes
that
glowed
like
fiery
coals
mistress
nutter
seemed
little
moved
by
the
storm
though
she
kept
a
profound
silence
but
when
alizon
gazed
in
her
face
she
was
frightened
by
its
expression
which
reminded
her
of
the
terrible
aspect
she
had
worn
at
the
interview
with
mother
chattox
all
at
once
mistress
nutter
arose
and
rapid
as
the
lightning
playing
around
her
and
revealing
her
movements
made
several
passes
with
extended
hands
over
her
daughter
and
on
this
the
latter
instantly
fell
back
as
if
fainting
though
still
retaining
her
consciousness
and
what
was
stranger
still
though
her
eyes
were
closed
her
power
of
sight
remained
in
this
condition
she
fancied
invisible
forms
were
moving
about
her
strange
sounds
seemed
to
salute
her
ears
like
the
gibbering
of
ghosts
and
she
thought
she
felt
the
flapping
of
unseen
wings
around
her
all
at
once
her
attention
was
drawn
she
knew
not
why
towards
the
closet
and
from
out
it
she
fancied
she
saw
issue
the
tall
dark
figure
of
a
man
she
was
sure
she
saw
him
for
her
imagination
could
not
body
forth
features
charged
with
such
a
fiendish
expression
or
eyes
of
such
unearthly
lustre
he
was
clothed
in
black
but
the
fashion
of
his
raiments
was
unlike
aught
she
had
ever
seen
his
stature
was
gigantic
and
a
pale
phosphoric
light
enshrouded
him
as
he
advanced
forked
lightnings
shot
into
the
room
and
the
thunder
split
overhead
the
owl
hooted
fearfully
quitted
its
perch
and
flew
off
by
the
way
it
had
entered
the
chamber
the
dark
shape
came
on
it
stood
beside
mistress
nutter
and
she
prostrated
herself
before
it
the
gestures
of
the
figure
were
angry
and
imperious
those
of
mistress
nutter
supplicating
their
converse
was
drowned
by
the
rattling
of
the
storm
at
last
the
figure
pointed
to
alizon
and
the
word
midnight
broke
in
tones
louder
than
the
thunder
from
its
lips
all
consciousness
then
forsook
her
how
long
she
continued
in
this
state
she
knew
not
but
the
touch
of
a
finger
applied
to
her
brow
seemed
to
recall
her
suddenly
to
animation
she
heaved
a
deep
sigh
and
looked
around
a
wondrous
change
had
occurred
the
storm
had
passed
off
and
the
moon
was
shining
brightly
over
the
top
of
the
flooding
the
chamber
with
its
gentle
radiance
while
her
mother
was
bending
over
her
with
looks
of
tenderest
affection
you
are
better
now
sweet
child
said
mistress
nutter
you
were
overcome
by
the
storm
it
was
sudden
and
terrible
terrible
indeed
replied
alizon
imperfectly
recalling
what
had
passed
but
it
was
not
alone
the
storm
that
frightened
me
this
chamber
has
been
invaded
by
evil
beings
methought
i
beheld
a
dark
figure
come
from
out
yon
closet
and
stand
before
you
you
have
been
thrown
into
a
state
of
stupor
by
the
influence
of
the
electric
fluid
replied
mistress
nutter
and
while
in
that
condition
visions
have
passed
through
your
brain
that
is
all
my
child
oh
i
hope
so
said
alizon
such
ecstasies
are
of
frequent
occurrence
replied
mistress
nutter
but
since
you
are
quite
recovered
we
will
descend
to
lady
assheton
who
may
wonder
at
our
absence
you
will
share
this
room
with
me
my
child
for
as
i
have
already
said
you
can
not
return
to
elizabeth
device
i
will
make
all
needful
explanations
to
lady
assheton
and
will
see
elizabeth
in
the
morning
perhaps
reassure
yourself
sweet
child
there
is
nothing
to
fear
i
trust
not
mother
replied
alizon
but
it
would
ease
my
mind
to
look
into
that
closet
do
so
then
by
all
means
replied
mistress
nutter
with
a
forced
smile
alizon
peeped
timorously
into
the
little
room
which
was
lighted
up
by
the
moon
rays
there
was
a
faded
white
habit
like
the
robe
of
a
cistertian
monk
hanging
in
one
corner
and
beneath
it
an
old
chest
alizon
would
fain
have
opened
the
chest
but
mistress
nutter
called
out
to
her
impatiently
you
will
discover
nothing
i
am
sure
come
let
us
go
and
they
quitted
the
room
together
chapter
the
two
portraits
in
the
the
lay
immediately
under
the
long
gallery
corresponding
with
it
in
all
but
height
and
though
in
this
respect
it
fell
somewhat
short
of
the
magnificent
upper
room
it
was
quite
lofty
enough
to
admit
of
a
gallery
of
its
own
for
spectators
and
minstrels
great
pains
had
been
taken
in
decorating
the
hall
for
the
occasion
between
the
forest
of
stags
horns
that
branched
from
the
gallery
rails
were
hung
rich
carpets
intermixed
with
garlands
of
flowers
and
banners
painted
with
the
arms
of
the
assheton
family
were
suspended
from
the
corners
over
the
fireplace
where
despite
the
advanced
season
a
pile
of
turf
and
wood
was
burning
were
hung
two
panoplies
of
arms
and
above
them
on
a
bracket
was
set
a
complete
suit
of
mail
once
belonging
to
richard
assheton
the
first
possessor
of
the
mansion
on
the
opposite
wall
hung
two
remarkable
portraits
the
one
representing
a
religious
votaress
in
a
loose
robe
of
black
with
wide
sleeves
holding
a
rosary
and
missal
in
her
hand
and
having
her
brow
and
neck
entirely
concealed
by
the
wimple
in
which
her
head
and
shoulders
were
enveloped
such
of
her
features
as
could
be
seen
were
of
extraordinary
loveliness
though
of
a
voluptuous
character
the
eyes
being
dark
and
languishing
and
shaded
by
long
lashes
and
the
lips
and
full
this
was
the
fair
votaress
isole
de
heton
who
brought
such
scandal
on
the
abbey
in
the
reign
of
henry
vi
the
other
portrait
was
that
of
an
abbot
in
the
white
gown
and
scapulary
of
the
cistertian
order
the
countenance
was
proud
and
stern
but
tinctured
with
melancholy
in
a
small
shield
at
one
corner
the
arms
were
blazoned
argent
a
fess
between
three
mullets
sable
pierced
of
the
field
a
crescent
for
difference
proving
it
to
be
the
portrait
of
john
paslew
both
pictures
had
been
found
in
the
lodgings
when
taken
possession
of
by
richard
assheton
but
they
owed
their
present
position
to
his
descendant
sir
ralph
who
discovering
them
in
an
closet
where
they
had
been
cast
aside
and
struck
with
their
extraordinary
merit
hung
them
up
as
above
stated
the
long
oaken
table
usually
standing
in
the
middle
of
the
hall
had
been
removed
to
one
side
to
allow
free
scope
for
dancing
and
other
pastimes
but
it
was
still
devoted
to
hospitable
uses
being
covered
with
trenchers
and
and
spread
for
a
substantial
repast
near
it
stood
two
carvers
with
aprons
round
their
waists
brandishing
long
knives
while
other
yeomen
of
the
kitchen
and
cellar
were
at
hand
to
keep
the
trenchers
well
supplied
and
the
cups
filled
with
strong
ale
or
bragget
as
might
suit
the
taste
of
the
guests
nor
were
these
the
only
festive
preparations
the
upper
part
of
the
hall
was
reserved
for
sir
ralph
immediate
friends
and
here
on
a
slightly
raised
elevation
stood
a
cross
table
spread
for
a
goodly
supper
the
snowy
napery
being
ornamented
with
wreaths
and
ropes
of
flowers
and
shining
with
costly
vessels
at
the
lower
end
of
the
room
beneath
the
gallery
which
it
served
to
support
was
a
gothic
screen
embellishing
an
open
armoury
which
made
a
grand
display
of
silver
plates
and
flagons
through
one
of
the
doorways
contrived
in
this
screen
the
revellers
were
ushered
into
the
hall
by
old
adam
whitworth
the
steward
i
pray
you
be
seated
good
masters
and
you
too
comely
dames
said
adam
leading
them
to
the
table
and
assigning
each
a
place
with
his
wand
fall
to
and
spare
not
for
it
is
my
honoured
master
desire
you
should
sup
well
you
will
find
that
venison
pasty
worth
a
trial
and
the
baked
red
deer
in
the
centre
of
the
table
is
a
noble
dish
the
fellow
to
it
was
served
at
sir
ralph
own
table
at
dinner
and
was
pronounced
excellent
i
pray
you
try
it
here
ned
scargill
mind
your
office
good
fellow
and
break
me
that
deer
and
you
paul
pimlot
exercise
your
craft
on
the
venison
pasty
and
as
trencher
after
trencher
was
rapidly
filled
by
the
two
carvers
who
demeaned
themselves
in
their
task
like
men
acquainted
with
the
powers
of
rustic
appetite
the
old
steward
addressed
himself
to
the
dames
what
can
i
do
for
you
fair
mistresses
he
said

with
curds
of

posset
eggs
and
ale
and
seasoned

sweet
dame
tetlow
squire
nicholas
gave
me
special
caution
to
take
care
of
you
but
the
injunction
was
unneeded
as
i
should
have
done
so
without
another
cup
of
canary

knave

to
the
health
of

added
in
a
low
tone
as
he
handed

with

mester

that
protty
speech
th

himself
replied
dame
tetlow
laughing
it
may
be
the
recollection
of
something
said
to
me
by
him
brought
to
mind
by
your
presence
replied
adam

gallantly
if

and

and
you
will
the
better
please
your
liberal
entertainer
and
my
honoured
master
thus
exhorted
the
guests
set
seriously
to
work
to
fulfil
the
hospitable
intentions
of
the
provider
of
the
feast
cups
flowed
fast
and
freely
and
erelong
little
was
left
of
the
venison
pasty
but
the
outer
crust
and
nothing
more
than
a
few
fragments
of
the
baked
red
deer
the
lighter
articles
then
came
in
for
a
share
of
attention
and
salmon
from
the
ribble
jack
trout
and
eels
from
the
hodder
and
calder
boiled
broiled
stewed
and
pickled
and
of
delicious
flavour
were
discussed
with
infinite
relish
puddings
and
pastry
were
left
to
more
delicate
stomachs
the
solids
only
being
in
request
with
the
men
hitherto
the
demolition
of
the
viands
had
given
sufficient
employment
but
now
the
edge
of
appetite
beginning
to
be
dulled
tongues
were
unloosed
and
much
merriment
prevailed
more
than
eighty
in
number
the
guests
were
dispersed
without
any
regard
to
order
and
thus
the
chief
actors
in
the
revel
were
scattered
promiscuously
about
the
table
diversifying
it
with
their
gay
costumes
robin
hood
sat
between
two
pretty
female
whose
partners
had
got
to
the
other
end
of
the
table
while
ned
huddlestone
the
representative
of
friar
tuck
was
equally
fortunate
having
a
buxom
dame
on
either
side
of
him
towards
whom
he
distributed
his
favours
with
singular
impartiality
as
porter
to
the
abbey
ned
made
himself
at
home
and
next
to
adam
whitworth
was
perhaps
the
most
important
personage
present
continually
roaring
for
ale
and
pledging
the
damsels
around
him
from
the
way
he
went
on
it
seemed
highly
probable
he
would
be
under
the
table
before
supper
was
over
but
ned
huddlestone
like
the
burly
priest
whose
gown
he
wore
had
a
stout
bullet
head
proof
against
all
assaults
of
liquor
and
the
copious
draughts
he
swallowed
instead
of
subduing
him
only
tended
to
make
him
more
uproarious
blessed
also
with
lusty
lungs
his
shouts
of
laughter
made
the
roof
ring
again
but
if
the
strong
liquor
failed
to
make
due
impression
upon
him
the
like
can
not
be
said
of
jack
roby
who
it
will
be
remembered
took
the
part
of
the
fool
and
who
having
drunk
overmuch
mistook
the
for
a
real
steed
and
in
an
effort
to
bestride
it
fell
on
the
floor
and
being
found
incapable
of
rising
was
carried
out
to
an
adjoining
room
and
laid
on
a
bench
this
however
was
the
only
case
of
excess
for
though
the
sherwood
foresters
emptied
their
cups
often
enough
to
heighten
their
mirth
none
of
them
seemed
the
worse
for
what
they
drank
lawrence
blackrod
parker
keeper
had
fortunately
got
next
to
his
old
flame
sukey
worseley
while
phil
rawson
the
forester
who
enacted
will
scarlet
and
nancy
holt
between
whom
an
equally
tender
feeling
subsisted
had
likewise
got
together
a
little
beyond
them
sat
the
gentleman
usher
and
parish
clerk
sampson
harrop
who
piquing
himself
on
his
good
manners
drank
very
sparingly
and
was
content
to
sup
on
sweetmeats
and
a
bowl
of
fleetings
as
curds
separated
from
whey
are
termed
in
this
district
tom
the
piper
and
his
companion
the
taborer
ate
for
the
next
week
but
were
somewhat
more
sparing
in
the
matter
of
drink
their
services
as
minstrels
being
required
later
on
thus
the
various
guests
enjoyed
themselves
according
to
their
bent
and
universal
hilarity
prevailed
it
would
be
strange
indeed
if
it
had
been
otherwise
for
what
with
the
good
cheer
and
the
bright
eyes
around
them
the
rustics
had
attained
a
point
of
felicity
not
likely
to
be
surpassed
of
the
numerous
assemblage
more
than
half
were
of
the
fairer
sex
and
of
these
the
greater
portion
were
young
and
while
in
the
case
of
the
their
natural
charms
were
heightened
by
their
fanciful
attire
before
supper
was
half
over
it
became
so
dark
that
it
was
found
necessary
to
illuminate
the
great
lamp
suspended
from
the
centre
of
the
roof
while
other
lights
were
set
on
the
board
and
two
flaming
torches
placed
in
sockets
on
either
side
of
the
scarcely
was
this
accomplished
when
the
storm
came
on
much
to
the
surprise
of
the
weatherwise
who
had
not
calculated
upon
such
an
occurrence
not
having
seen
any
indications
whatever
of
it
in
the
heavens
but
all
were
too
comfortably
sheltered
and
too
well
employed
to
pay
much
attention
to
what
was
going
on
without
and
unless
when
a
flash
of
lightning
more
than
usually
vivid
dazzled
the
gaze
or
a
peal
of
thunder
more
appalling
than
the
rest
broke
overhead
no
alarm
was
expressed
even
by
the
women
to
be
sure
a
little
pretty
trepidation
was
now
and
then
evinced
by
the
younger
damsels
but
even
this
was
only
done
with
the
view
of
exacting
attention
on
the
part
of
their
swains
and
never
failed
in
effect
the
therefore
instead
of
putting
a
stop
to
the
general
enjoyment
only
tended
to
increase
it
however
the
last
peal
was
loud
enough
to
silence
the
most
uproarious
the
women
turned
pale
and
the
men
looked
at
each
other
anxiously
listening
to
hear
if
any
damage
had
been
done
but
as
nothing
transpired
their
spirits
revived
a
few
minutes
afterwards
word
was
brought
that
the
conventual
church
had
been
struck
by
a
thunderbolt
but
this
was
not
regarded
as
a
very
serious
disaster
the
bearer
of
the
intelligence
was
little
jennet
who
said
she
had
been
caught
in
the
ruins
by
the
storm
and
after
being
dreadfully
frightened
by
the
lightning
had
seen
a
bolt
strike
the
steeple
and
heard
some
stones
rattle
down
after
which
she
ran
away
no
one
thought
of
inquiring
what
she
had
been
doing
there
at
the
time
but
room
was
made
for
her
at
the
next
to
sampson
harrop
while
the
good
steward
patting
her
on
the
head
filled
her
a
cup
of
canary
with
his
own
hand
and
gave
her
some
cates
to
eat
ey
dunna
see
alizon
observed
the
little
girl
looking
round
the
table
after
she
had
drunk
the
wine
your
sister
is
not
here
jennet
replied
adam
whitworth
with
a
smile
she
is
too
great
a
lady
for
us
now
since
she
came
up
with
her
ladyship
from
the
green
she
has
been
treated
quite
like
one
of
the
guests
and
has
been
walking
about
the
garden
and
ruins
all
the
afternoon
with
young
mistress
dorothy
who
has
taken
quite
a
fancy
to
her
indeed
for
the
matter
of
that
all
the
ladies
seem
to
have
taken
a
fancy
to
her
and
she
is
now
closeted
with
mistress
nutter
in
her
own
room
this
was
gall
and
wormwood
to
jennet
she
be
hard
to
please
when
she
goes
home
again
after
playing
the
fine
dame
here
pursued
the
steward
then
ey
hope
she
never
come
home
again
rejoined
jennet
spitefully
fo
we
dunna

dames
i
our
poor
cottage
for
my
part
i
do
not
wonder
alizon

the
gentle
folks
observed
sampson
harrop
since
such
pains
have
been
taken
with
her
manners
and
education
and
i
must
say
she
does
great
credit
to
her
instructor
who
for
reasons
unnecessary
to
mention
shall
be
nameless
i
wish
i
could
say
the
same
for
you
jennet
but
though
you
not
deficient
in
ability
you

perseverance
or
pleasure

replied
jennet
an
more
than

mester
harrop
why
is
alizon
always
to
be
thrown
i
my

onny
how
said
jennet
unluckily
that
can
not
be
denied
replied
sampson
but
you
as
different
from
her
as
light
from
darkness
jennet
eyed
him
bitterly
and
then
rose
from
the
table
go
she
said
no
no
sit

interposed
the
steward
the
dancing
and
pastimes
will
begin
presently
and
you
will
see
your
sister
she
will
come
down
with
the
ladies
that
the
very
reason
she
wishes
to
go
said
sampson
harrop
the
spiteful
little
creature
can
not
bear
to
see
her
sister
better
treated
than
herself
go
your
ways
then
it
is
the
best
thing
you

do

the

laughing
as
the
little

walked
away
i
should
account
it
a
disgrace
to
bandy
words
with
the
like
of
her
adam
rejoined
the
clerk
angrily
but
i
greatly
out
in
my
reckoning
if
she
does
not
make
a
second
mother
demdike
and
worse
could
not
well
befall
her
jennet
society
could
have
been
very
well
dispensed
with
by
her
two
friends
but
she
would
not
be
shaken
off
on
the
contrary
finding
herself
in
the
way
she
only
determined
the
more
pertinaciously
to
remain
and
began
to
exercise
all
her
powers
of
teasing
which
have
been
described
as
considerable
and
which
on
this
occasion
proved
eminently
successful
and
the
worst
of
it
was
there
was
no
crushing
the
plaguy
little
insect
any
effort
made
to
catch
her
only
resulting
in
an
escape
on
her
part
and
a
new
charge
on
some
undefended
quarter
with
sharper
stinging
and
more
intolerable
buzzing
than
ever
out
of
all
patience
sukey

the
dole
that

efore
an
he
neaw
one
o
our
party
the
latter
observation
was
occasioned
by
the
entrance
of
a
tall
personage
in
the
garb
of
a
cistertian
monk
who
issued
from
one
of
the
doorways
in
the
screen
and
glided
towards
the
upper
table
attracting
general
attention
and
misgiving
as
he
proceeded
his
countenance
was
cadaverous
his
lips
livid
and
his
eyes
black
and
deep
sunken
in
their
sockets
with
a
circle
around
them
his
frame
was
meagre
and
bony
what
remained
of
hair
on
his
head
was
raven
black
but
either
he
was
bald
on
the
crown
or
carried
his
attention
to
costume
so
far
as
to
adopt
the
priestly
tonsure
his
forehead
was
lofty
and
sallow
and
seemed
stamped
like
his
features
with
profound
gloom
his
garments
were
faded
and
mouldering
and
materially
contributed
to
his
ghostly
appearance
who
is

cried
sukey
and
nance
together
but
no
one
could
answer
the
question
he

blackrod
gaping
with
alarm
for
the
stout

assailable

there

the
stranger
without
returning
the
glances
fixed
upon

or
deigning
to
notice
any
of
the
company
pursued
his
way
and
sat
down
in
a
chair
at
the
upper
table
but
his
entrance
had
been
witnessed
by
others
besides
the
rustic
guests
and
servitors

richard

to
be
in

time
and
greatly
struck
by
the
singularity
of
his
appearance
immediately
descended
to
make
inquiries
respecting
him
as
they
appeared
below
the
old
steward
advanced
to
meet
them
who
the
devil
have
you
got
there
adam
asked
the
squire
it
passeth
me
almost
to
tell
you
master
nicholas
replied
the
steward
and
not
knowing
whether
the
gentleman
be
invited
or
not
i
am
fain
to
wait
sir
ralph
pleasure
in
regard
to
him
have
you
no
notion
who
he
is
inquired
richard
all
i
know
about
him
may
be
soon
told
master
richard
replied
adam
he
is
a
stranger
in
these
parts
and
hath
very
recently
taken
up
his
abode
in
wiswall
hall
which
has
been
abandoned
of
late
years
as
you
know
and
suffered
to
go
to
decay
some
few
months
ago
an
aged
couple
from
colne
named
hewit
took
possession
of
part
of
the
hall
and
were
suffered
to
remain
there
though
old
katty
hewit
or
as
she
is
familiarly
termed
by
the
common
folk
is
in
no
very
good
repute
hereabouts
and
was
driven
it
is
said
from
colne
owing
to
her
practices
as
a
witch
be
that
as
it
may
soon
after
these
hewits
were
settled
at
wiswall
comes
this
stranger
and
fixes
himself
in
another
part
of
the
hall
how
he
lives
no
one
can
tell
but
it
is
said
he
rambles
all
night
long
like
a
troubled
spirit
about
the
deserted
rooms
attended
by
mother
while
in
the
daytime
he
is
never
seen
can
he
be
of
sound
mind
asked
richard
hardly
so
i
should
think
master
richard
replied
the
steward
as
to
who
he
may
be
there
are
many
opinions
and
some
aver
he
is
francis
paslew
grandson
of
francis
brother
to
the
abbot
and
being
a
jesuit
priest
for
you
know
the
paslews
have
all
strictly
adhered
to
the
old
faith
and
that
is
why
they
have
fled
the
country
and
abandoned
their
residence
he
is
obliged
to
keep
himself
concealed
if
such
be
the
case
he
must
be
crazed
indeed
to
venture
here
observed
nicholas
and
yet
i
am
half
inclined
to
credit
the
report
look
at
him
dick
he
is
the
very
image
of
the
old
abbot
yon
portrait
might
have
been
painted
for
him
said
richard
gazing
at
the
picture
on
the
wall
and
from
it
to
the
monk
as
he
spoke
the
very
same
garb
too
there
is
an
old
monastic
robe
in
the
closet
adjoining
the
room
occupied
by
mistress
nutter
observed
the
steward
said
to
be
the
garment
in
which
abbot
paslew
suffered
death
some
stains
are
upon
it
supposed
to
be
the
blood
of
the
wizard
demdike
who
perished
in
an
extraordinary
manner
on
the
same
day
i
have
seen
it
cried
nicholas
and
the
monk
habit
looks
precisely
like
it
and
if
my
eyes
deceive
me
not
is
stained
in
the
same
manner
i
see
the
spots
plainly
on
the
breast
cried
richard
how
can
he
have
procured
the
robe
heaven
only
knows
replied
the
old
steward
it
is
a
very
strange
occurrence
i
will
go
question
him
said
richard
so
saying
he
proceeded
to
the
upper
table
accompanied
by
nicholas
as
they
drew
near
the
stranger
arose
and
fixed
a
grim
look
upon
richard
who
was
a
little
in
advance
it
is
the
abbot
ghost
cried
nicholas
stopping
and
detaining
his
cousin
you
shall
not
address
it
during
the
contention
that
ensued
the
monk
glided
towards
a
at
the
upper
end
of
the
hall
and
passed
through
it
so
general
was
the
consternation
that
no
one
attempted
to
stay
him
nor
would
any
one
follow
to
see
whither
he
went
released
at
length
from
the
strong
grasp
of
the
squire
richard
rushed
forth
and
not
returning
nicholas
after
the
lapse
of
a
few
minutes
went
in
search
of
him
but
came
back
presently
and
told
the
old
steward
he
could
neither
find
him
nor
the
monk
master
richard
will
be
back
anon
i
dare
say
adam
he
remarked
if
not
i
will
make
further
search
for
him
but
you
had
better
not
mention
this
mysterious
occurrence
to
sir
ralph
at
all
events
not
until
the
festivities
are
over
and
the
ladies
have
retired
it
might
disturb
them
i
fear
the
appearance
of
this
monk
bodes
no
good
to
our
family
and
what
makes
it
worse
is
it
is
not
the
first
ill
omen
that
has
befallen
us
master
richard
was
unlucky
enough
to
stand
on
abbot
paslew
grave
mercy
on
us
that
was
unlucky
indeed
cried
adam
in
great
trepidation
poor
dear
young
gentleman
bid
him
take
especial
care
of
himself
good
master
nicholas
i
noticed
just
now
that
yon
fearsome
monk
regarded
him
more
attentively
than
you
bid
him
be
careful
i
conjure
you
sir
but
here
comes
my
honoured
master
and
his
guests
here
gregory
dickon
bestir
yourselves
knaves
and
serve
supper
at
the
upper
table
in
a
trice
any
apprehensions
nicholas
might
entertain
for
richard
were
at
this
moment
relieved
for
as
sir
ralph
and
his
guests
came
in
at
one
door
the
young
man
entered
by
another
he
looked
deathly
pale
nicholas
put
his
finger
to
his
lips
in
token
of
silence
a
gesture
which
the
other
signified
that
he
understood
sir
ralph
and
his
guests
having
taken
their
places
at
the
table
an
excellent
and
plentiful
repast
was
speedily
set
before
them
and
if
they
did
not
do
quite
such
ample
justice
to
it
as
the
hungry
rustics
at
the
lower
board
had
done
to
the
good
things
provided
for
them
the
cook
could
not
reasonably
complain
no
allusion
whatever
being
made
to
the
recent
strange
occurrence
the
cheerfulness
of
the
company
was
uninterrupted
but
the
noise
in
the
lower
part
of
the
hall
had
in
a
great
measure
subsided
partly
out
of
respect
to
the
host
and
partly
in
consequence
of
the
alarm
occasioned
by
the
supposed
supernatural
visitation
richard
continued
silent
and
preoccupied
and
neither
ate
nor
drank
but
nicholas
appearing
to
think
his
courage
would
be
best
sustained
by
an
extra
allowance
of
clary
and
sack
applied
himself
frequently
to
the
goblet
with
that
view
and
erelong
his
spirits
improved
so
wonderfully
and
his
natural
boldness
was
so
much
increased
that
he
was
ready
to
confront
abbot
paslew
or
any
other
abbot
of
them
all
wherever
they
might
chance
to
cross
him
in
this
enterprising
frame
of
mind
he
drew
richard
aside
and
questioned
him
as
to
what
had
taken
place
in
his
pursuit
of
the
mysterious
monk
you
overtook
him
dick
of
course
he
said
and
put
it
to
him
roundly
why
he
came
hither
where
neither
ghosts
nor
jesuit
priests
whichever
he
may
be
are
wanted
what
answered
he
eh
would
i
had
been
there
to
interrogate
him
he
should
have
declared
how
he
became
possessed
of
that
old
monkish
gown
or
i
would
have
unfrocked
him
even
if
he
had
proved
to
be
a
skeleton
but
i
interrupt
you
you
have
not
told
me
what
occurred
at
the
interview
there
was
no
interview
replied
richard
gravely
no
interview
echoed
nicholas
man
but
i
must
be
careful
for
doctor
ormerod
and
parson
dewhurst
are
within
hearing
and
may
lecture
me
on
the
wantonness
and
profanity
of
swearing
by
saint
gregory
de
northbury
no
that
an
oath
too
and
what
is
worse
a
popish
oath
by
i
have
several
tremendous
imprecations
at
my
tongue
end
but
they
shall
not
out
it
is
a
sinful
propensity
and
must
be
controlled
in
a
word
then
you
let
him
escape
dick
if
you
were
so
anxious
to
stay
him
i
wonder
you
came
not
with
me
replied
richard
but
you
now
hold
very
different
language
from
what
you
used
when
i
quitted
the
hall
ah
true
right
dick
replied
nicholas
my
sentiments
have
undergone
a
wonderful
change
since
then
i
now
regret
having
stopped
you
by
my
troth
if
i
meet
that
confounded
monk
again
he
shall
give
a
good
account
of
himself
i
promise
him
but
what
said
he
to
you
dick
make
an
end
of
your
story
i
have
not
begun
it
yet
replied
richard
but
pay
attention
and
you
shall
hear
what
occurred
when
i
rushed
forth
the
monk
had
already
gained
the
no
one
was
within
it
at
the
time
all
the
being
busied
here
with
the
feasting
i
summoned
him
to
stay
but
he
answered
not
and
still
grimly
regarding
me
glided
towards
the
outer
door
which
i
know
not
by
what
chance
stood
open
and
passing
through
it
closed
it
upon
me
this
delayed
me
a
moment
and
when
i
got
out
he
had
already
descended
the
steps
and
was
moving
towards
the
garden
it
was
bright
moonlight
so
i
could
see
him
distinctly
and
mark
this
nicholas
the
two
great
were
running
about
at
large
in
the
but
they
slunk
off
as
if
alarmed
at
his
appearance
the
monk
had
now
gained
the
garden
and
was
shaping
his
course
swiftly
towards
the
ruined
conventual
church
determined
to
overtake
him
i
quickened
my
pace
but
he
gained
the
old
fane
before
me
and
threaded
the
broken
aisles
with
noiseless
celerity
in
the
choir
he
paused
and
confronted
me
when
within
a
few
yards
of
him
i
paused
arrested
by
his
fixed
and
terrible
gaze
nicholas
his
look
froze
my
blood
i
would
have
spoken
but
i
could
not
my
tongue
clove
to
the
roof
of
my
mouth
for
very
fear
before
i
could
shake
off
this
apprehension
the
figure
raised
its
hand
menacingly
thrice
and
passed
into
the
lacy
chapel
as
soon
as
he
was
gone
my
courage
returned
and
i
followed
the
little
chapel
was
brilliantly
illuminated
by
the
moon
but
it
was
empty
i
could
only
see
the
white
monument
of
sir
henry
de
lacy
glistening
in
the
pale
radiance
i
must
take
a
cup
of
wine
after
this
horrific
relation
said
nicholas
replenishing
his
goblet
it
has
chilled
my
blood
as
the
monk
icy
gaze
froze
yours
body
o
me
but
this
is
strange
indeed
another
oath
lord
help
me
i
shall
never
get
rid
of
the
infernal
i
mean
the
evil
habit
will
you
not
pledge
me
dick
the
young
man
shook
his
head
you
are
wrong
pursued
nicholas
decidedly
wrong
wine
gladdeneth
the
heart
of
man
and
restoreth
courage
a
short
while
ago
i
was
downcast
as
you
melancholy
as
an
owl
and
timorous
as
a
kid
but
now
i
am
resolute
as
an
eagle
stout
of
heart
and
cheerful
of
spirit
and
all
owing
to
a
cup
of
wine
try
the
remedy
dick
and
get
rid
of
your
gloom
you
look
like
a
at
a
festival
what
if
you
have
stumbled
on
an
grave
what
if
you
have
been
banned
by
a
witch
what
if
you
have
stood
face
to
face
with
the
devil
or
a
ghost
heed
them
not
drink
and
set
care
at
defiance
and
not
to
gainsay
my
own
counsel
i
shall
fill
my
cup
again
for
in
good
sooth
this
is
rare
clary
dick
and
talking
of
wine
you
should
taste
some
of
the
wonderful
rhenish
found
in
the
abbot
cellar
by
our
ancestor
richard
assheton
a
century
old
if
it
be
a
day
and
yet
cordial
and
corroborative
as
ever
those
monks
were
lusty
tipplers
dick
i
sometimes
wish
i
had
been
an
abbot
myself
i
should
have
made
a
rare
father
confessor
especially
to
a
pretty
penitent
here
gregory
hie
thee
to
the
master
cellarer
and
bid
him
fill
me
a
goblet
of
the
old
rhenish
the
wine
from
the
cellar
thou
understandest
or
stay
better
bring
the
flask
i
have
a
profound
respect
for
the
venerable
bottle
and
would
pay
my
devoirs
to
it
hie
away
good
fellow
you
will
drink
too
much
if
you
go
on
thus
remarked
richard
not
a
drop
rejoined
nicholas
i
am
blithe
as
a
lark
and
would
keep
so
that
is
why
i
drink
but
to
return
to
our
ghosts
since
this
place
must
be
haunted
i
would
it
were
visited
by
spirits
of
a
livelier
kind
than
old
paslew
there
is
isole
de
heton
for
instance
the
fair
votaress
would
be
the
sort
of
ghost
for
me
i
would
not
turn
my
back
on
her
but
face
her
manfully
look
at
her
picture
dick
was
ever
countenance
sweeter
than
hers
lips
more
tempting
or
eyes
more
melting
is
she
not
adorable
zounds
he
exclaimed
suddenly
pausing
and
staring
at
the
portrait
would
you
believe
it
dick
the
fair
isole
winked
at
me
i
swear
she
did
i
mean
i
will
venture
to
affirm
upon
oath
if
required
that
she
winked
pshaw
exclaimed
richard
the
fumes
of
the
wine
have
mounted
to
your
brain
and
disordered
it
no
such
thing
cried
nicholas
regarding
the
picture
as
steadily
as
he
could
she
leering
at
me
now
by
the
queen
of
paphos
another
wink
nay
if
you
doubt
me
watch
her
well
yourself
a
pleasant
adventure
this
ha
ha
a
truce
to
this
drunken
foolery
cried
richard
moving
away
drunken
recall
that
epithet
dick
cried
nicholas
angrily
i
am
no
more
drunk
than
yourself
you
dog
i
can
walk
as
steadily
and
see
as
plainly
as
you
and
i
will
maintain
it
at
the
point
of
the
sword
that
the
eyes
of
that
picture
have
lovingly
regarded
me
nay
that
they
follow
me
now
a
common
delusion
with
a
portrait
said
richard
they
appear
to
follow
but
they
do
not
wink
at
you
as
they
do
at
me
said
nicholas
neither
do
the
lips
break
into
smiles
and
display
the
pearly
teeth
beneath
them
as
occurs
in
my
case
grim
old
abbots
frown
on
you
but
fair
though
frail
votaresses
smile
on
me
i
am
the
favoured
mortal
dick
were
it
as
you
represent
nicholas
replied
richard
gravely
i
should
say
indeed
that
some
evil
principle
was
at
work
to
lure
you
through
your
passions
to
perdition
but
i
know
they
are
all
fancies
engendered
by
your
heated
brain
which
in
your
calmer
moments
you
will
discard
as
i
discard
them
now
if
i
have
any
weight
with
you
i
counsel
you
to
drink
no
more
or
you
will
commit
some
mad
foolery
of
which
you
will
be
ashamed
hereafter
the
discreeter
course
would
be
to
retire
altogether
and
for
this
you
have
ample
excuse
as
you
will
have
to
arise
betimes
to
set
out
for
pendle
forest
with
master
potts
retire
exclaimed
nicholas
bursting
into
a
loud
contemptuous
laugh
i
like
thy
counsel
lad
yes
i
will
retire
when
i
have
finished
the
old
monastic
rhenish
which
gregory
is
bringing
me
i
will
retire
when
i
have
danced
the
morisco
with
the
may
queen
the
cushion
dance
with
dame
tetlow
and
the
brawl
with
the
lovely
isole
de
heton
another
wink
dick
by
our
lady
she
assents
to
my
proposition
when
i
have
done
all
this
and
somewhat
more
it
will
be
time
to
think
of
retiring
but
i
have
the
night
before
me
dick
not
to
be
spent
in
drowsy
unconsciousness
as
thou
recommendest
but
in
active
pleasurable
enjoyment
no
man
requires
less
sleep
than
i
do
ordinarily
i
as
thou
termest
it
at
ten
and
rise
with
the
sun
in
summer
i
am
abroad
soon
after
three
and
mend
that
if
thou
canst
dick
i
shall
seek
my
couch
about
midnight
and
yet
i
warrant
me
i
shall
be
the
first
stirring
in
the
abbey
and
in
any
case
i
shall
be
in
the
saddle
before
thee
it
may
be
replied
richard
but
it
was
to
preserve
you
from
extravagance
that
i
volunteered
advice
which
from
my
knowledge
of
your
character
i
might
as
well
have
withheld
but
let
me
caution
you
on
another
point
dance
with
dame
tetlow
or
any
other
dame
you
please
dance
with
the
fair
isole
de
heton
if
you
can
prevail
upon
her
to
descend
from
her
frame
and
give
you
her
hand
but
i
object
most
decidedly
object
to
your
dancing
with
alizon
device
why
so
cried
nicholas
why
should
i
not
dance
with
whom
i
please
and
what
right
hast
thou
to
forbid
me
alizon
troth
lad
art
thou
so
ignorant
of
human
nature
as
not
to
know
that
forbidden
fruit
is
the
sweetest
it
hath
ever
been
so
since
the
fall
i
am
now
only
the
more
bent
upon
dancing
with
the
prohibited
damsel
but
i
would
fain
know
the
principle
on
which
thou
erectest
thyself
into
her
guardian
is
it
because
she
fainted
when
thy
sword
was
crossed
with
that
fool
sir
thomas
metcalfe
that
thou
flatterest
thyself
she
is
in
love
with
thee
be
not
too
sure
of
it
dick
many
a
timid
wench
has
swooned
at
the
sight
of
a
naked
weapon
without
being
enamoured
of
the
swordsman
the
fainting
proves
nothing
but
grant
she
loves
thee
what
then
an
end
must
speedily
come
of
it
so
better
finish
at
once
before
she
be
entangled
in
a
mesh
from
which
she
can
not
be
extricated
without
danger
for
hark
thee
dick
whatever
thou
mayst
think
i
am
not
so
far
gone
that
i
know
not
what
i
say
neither
is
my
vision
so
much
obscured
that
i
see
not
some
matters
plainly
enough
and
i
understand
thee
and
alizon
well
and
see
through
you
both
this
matter
must
go
no
further
it
has
gone
too
far
already
after
you
must
see
her
no
more
i
am
serious
in
this
serious
if
such
a
thing
can
be
it
is
necessary
to
observe
caution
for
reasons
that
will
at
once
occur
to
thee
thou
canst
not
wed
this
girl
then
why
trifle
with
her
till
her
heart
be
broken
broken
it
shall
never
be
by
me
cried
richard
but
i
tell
you
it
will
be
broken
if
you
do
not
desist
at
once
rejoined
nicholas
i
was
but
jesting
when
i
said
i
would
rob
you
of
her
in
the
morisco
though
it
would
be
charity
to
both
and
spare
you
many
a
pang
hereafter
were
i
to
put
my
threat
into
execution
however
i
have
a
soft
heart
where
aught
of
love
is
concerned
and
having
pointed
out
the
risk
you
will
incur
i
shall
leave
you
to
follow
your
own
devices
but
for
alizon
sake
stop
in
time
you
now
speak
soberly
and
sensibly
enough
nicholas
replied
richard
and
i
thank
you
heartily
for
your
counsel
and
if
i
do
not
follow
it
by
withdrawing
at
once
from
a
pursuit
which
may
appear
to
you
hopeless
if
not
dangerous
you
will
i
hope
give
me
credit
for
being
actuated
by
worthy
motives
i
will
at
once
and
frankly
admit
that
i
love
alizon
and
loving
her
you
may
rest
assured
i
would
sacrifice
my
life
a
thousand
times
rather
than
endanger
her
happiness
but
there
is
a
point
in
her
history
with
which
if
you
were
acquainted
it
might
alter
your
view
of
the
case
but
this
is
not
the
season
for
its
disclosure
neither
i
am
bound
to
say
does
the
circumstance
so
materially
alter
the
apparent
posture
of
affairs
as
to
remove
all
difficulty
on
the
contrary
it
leaves
an
insurmountable
obstacle
behind
it
are
you
wise
then
in
going
on
asked
nicholas
i
know
not
answered
richard
but
i
feel
as
if
i
were
the
sport
of
fate
uncertain
whither
to
turn
for
the
best
i
leave
the
disposition
of
my
course
to
chance
but
alas
he
added
sadly
all
seems
to
point
out
that
this
meeting
with
alizon
will
be
my
last
well
cheer
up
lad
said
nicholas
these
afflictions
are
hard
to
bear
it
is
true
but
somehow
they
are
got
over
just
as
if
your
horse
should
fling
you
in
the
midst
of
a
hedge
when
you
are
making
a
flying
leap
you
get
scratched
and
bruised
but
you
scramble
out
and
in
a
day
or
two
are
on
your
legs
again
love
breaks
no
bones
that
one
comfort
when
at
your
age
i
was
desperately
in
love
not
with
mistress
nicholas
assheton
heaven
help
the
fond
soul
but
with
never
mind
with
whom
but
it
was
not
a
very
prudent
match
and
so
in
my
worldly
wisdom
i
was
obliged
to
cry
off
a
sad
business
it
was
i
thought
i
should
have
died
of
it
and
i
made
quite
sure
that
the
devoted
girl
would
die
first
in
which
case
we
were
to
occupy
the
same
grave
but
i
was
not
driven
to
such
a
dire
extremity
for
before
i
had
kept
house
a
week
jack
walker
the
keeper
of
downham
made
his
appearance
in
my
room
and
after
telling
me
of
the
mischief
done
by
a
pair
of
otters
in
the
ribble
finding
me
in
a
very
desponding
state
ventured
to
inquire
if
i
had
heard
the
news
expecting
to
hear
of
the
death
of
the
girl
i
prepared
myself
for
an
outburst
of
grief
and
resolved
to
give
immediate
directions
for
a
double
funeral
when
he
informed
me
what
do
you
think
dick
that
she
was
going
to
be
married
to
himself
i
recovered
at
once
and
immediately
went
out
to
hunt
the
otters
and
rare
sport
we
had
but
here
comes
gregory
with
the
famous
old
rhenish
better
take
a
cup
dick
this
is
the
best
cure
for
the
heartache
and
for
all
other
aches
and
grievances
ah
glorious
stuff
miraculous
wine
he
added
smacking
his
lips
with
extraordinary
satisfaction
after
a
deep
draught
those
worthy
fathers
were
excellent
judges
i
have
a
great
reverence
for
them
but
where
can
alizon
be
all
this
while
supper
is
wellnigh
over
and
the
dancing
and
pastimes
will
commence
anon
and
yet
she
comes
not
she
is
here
cried
richard
and
as
he
spoke
mistress
nutter
and
alizon
entered
the
hall
richard
endeavoured
to
read
in
the
young
girl
countenance
some
intimation
of
what
had
passed
between
her
and
mistress
nutter
but
he
only
remarked
that
she
was
paler
than
before
and
had
traces
of
anxiety
about
her
mistress
nutter
also
looked
gloomy
and
thoughtful
and
there
was
nothing
in
the
manner
or
deportment
of
either
to
lead
to
the
conclusion
that
a
discovery
of
relationship
between
them
had
taken
place
as
alizon
moved
on
her
eyes
met
those
of
richard
but
the
look
was
intercepted
by
mistress
nutter
who
instantly
called
off
her
daughter
attention
to
herself
and
while
the
young
man
hesitated
to
join
them
his
sister
came
quickly
up
to
him
and
drew
him
away
in
another
direction
left
to
himself
nicholas
tossed
off
another
cup
of
the
miraculous
rhenish
which
improved
in
flavour
as
he
discussed
it
and
then
placing
a
chair
opposite
the
portrait
of
isole
de
heton
filled
a
bumper
and
uttering
the
name
of
the
fair
votaress
drained
it
to
her
this
time
he
was
quite
certain
he
received
a
significant
glance
in
return
and
no
one
being
near
to
contradict
him
he
went
on
indulging
the
idea
of
an
amorous
understanding
between
himself
and
the
picture
till
he
had
finished
the
bottle
and
obtained
as
many
ogles
as
he
swallowed
draughts
of
wine
upon
which
he
arose
and
staggered
off
in
search
of
dame
tetlow
meanwhile
mistress
nutter
having
made
her
excuses
to
lady
assheton
for
not
attending
the
supper
walked
down
the
hall
with
her
daughter
until
such
time
as
the
dancing
and
pastimes
should
commence
as
will
be
readily
supposed
under
the
circumstances
this
part
of
the
entertainment
was
distasteful
to
both
of
them
but
it
could
not
be
avoided
without
entering
into
explanations
which
mistress
nutter
was
unwilling
to
make
and
she
therefore
counselled
her
daughter
to
act
in
all
respects
as
if
she
were
still
alizon
device
and
in
no
way
connected
with
her
i
shall
take
an
early
opportunity
of
announcing
my
intention
to
adopt
you
she
said
and
then
you
can
act
differently
meantime
keep
near
me
as
much
as
you
can
say
little
to
dorothy
or
richard
assheton
and
prepare
to
retire
early
for
this
noisy
and
riotous
assemblage
is
not
much
to
my
taste
and
i
care
not
how
soon
i
quit
it
alizon
assented
to
what
was
said
and
stole
a
timid
glance
towards
richard
and
dorothy
but
the
latter
who
alone
perceived
it
instantly
averted
her
head
in
such
way
as
to
make
it
evident
she
wished
to
shun
her
regards
slight
as
it
was
this
circumstance
occasioned
alizon
much
pain
for
she
could
not
conceive
how
she
had
offended
her
friend
and
it
was
some
relief
to
encounter
a
party
of
acquaintances
who
had
risen
from
the
lower
table
at
her
approach
though
they
did
not
presume
to
address
her
while
she
was
with
mistress
nutter
but
waited
respectfully
at
a
little
distance
alizon
however
flew
towards
them
ah
susan

nancy
she
cried
taking
the
hand
of

how

she
rejoined
at
this
moment
mistress
nutter
came
up
my
good
friends
she
said
as
you
appear
to
take
so
much
interest
in
alizon
you
may
be
glad
to
learn
that
it
is
my
intention
to
adopt
her
as
a
daughter
having
no
child
of
my
own
and
though
her
position
henceforth
will
be
very
different
from
what
it
has
been
i
am
sure
she
will
never
forget
her
old
friends
never
indeed
never
cried
alizon
earnestly
this
is
good
news
indeed
cried
sampson
harrop
joyfully
while
the
others
joined
in
his
exclamation
we
all
rejoice
in
alizon
good
fortune
and
think
she
richly
deserves
it
for
my
own
part
i
was
always
sure
she
would
have
rare
luck
but
i
did
not
expect
such
luck
as
this
what
to
become
o
me
cried
jennet
coming
from
behind
a
chair
where
she
had
hitherto
concealed
herself
i
will
always
take
care
of
you
replied
alizon
stooping
and
kissing
her
do
not
promise
more
than
you
may
be
able
to
perform
alizon
observed
mistress
nutter
coldly
and
regarding
the
little
girl
with
a
look
of
disgust
an
little
creature
with
the
demdike
eyes
and
as
as
she
is
rejoined
sampson
harrop
and
though
she
can
not
help
being
ugly
she
might
help
being
malicious
jennet
gave
him
a
bitter
look

and
from

alizon

replied
the
little
girl
with
a
significant
and
malicious
look
at
mistress
nutter
ha
muttered
the
lady
there
is
more
malice
in
this
little
wasp
than
i
thought
but
i
must
rob
it
of
its
sting
and
while
thus
communing
with
herself
she
fixed
a
searching
look
on
jennet
and
then
raising
her
hand
quickly
waved
it
in
her
face
oh
cried
the
little
girl
falling
suddenly
backwards
what
the
matter
demanded

said
jennet
ey

soon

along
alizon
said
mistress
nutter
apparently
unconcerned
at
the
circumstance
having
confided
the
little
girl
who
was
now
recovered
from
the
shock
to
the
care
of
nancy
holt
alizon
followed
her
mother
at
this
moment
sir
ralph
who
had
quitted
the
clapped
his
hands
loudly
thus
giving
the
signal
to
the
minstrels
who
having
repaired
to
the
gallery
now
struck
up
a
merry
tune
and
instantly
the
whole
hall
was
in
motion
snatching
up
his
wand
sampson
harrop
hurried
after
alizon
beseeching
her
to
return
with
him
and
join
a
procession
about
to
be
formed
by
the
revellers
and
of
course
as
may
queen
and
the
most
important
personage
in
it
she
could
not
refuse
very
short
space
sufficed
the
to
find
their
partners
robin
hood
and
the
foresters
got
into
their
places
the
curveted
and
capered
friar
tuck
resumed
his
drolleries
and
even
jack
roby
was
so
far
recovered
as
to
be
able
to
get
on
his
legs
though
he
could
not
walk
very
steadily
marshalled
by
the
and
headed
by
robin
hood
and
the
may
queen
the
procession
marched
round
the
hall
the
minstrels
playing
merrily
the
while
and
then
drew
up
before
the
upper
table
where
a
brief
oration
was
pronounced
by
sir
ralph
a
shout
that
made
the
rafters
ring
again
followed
the
address
after
which
a
couranto
was
called
for
by
the
host
who
taking
mistress
nicholas
assheton
by
the
hand
led
her
into
the
body
of
the
hall
whither
he
was
speedily
followed
by
the
other
guests
who
had
found
partners
in
like
manner
before
relating
how
the
ball
was
opened
a
word
must
be
bestowed
upon
mistress
nicholas
assheton
whom
i
have
neglected
nearly
as
much
as
she
was
neglected
by
her
unworthy
spouse
and
i
therefore
hasten
to
repair
the
injustice
by
declaring
that
she
was
a
very
amiable
and
very
charming
woman
and
danced
delightfully
and
recollect
ladies
these
were
dancing
days
i
mean
days
when
knowledge
of
figures
as
well
as
skill
was
required
more
than
twenty
forgotten
dances
being
in
vogue
the
very
names
of
which
may
surprise
you
as
i
recapitulate
them
there
was
the
passamezzo
a
great
favourite
with
queen
elizabeth
who
used
to
foot
it
merrily
when
as
you
are
told
by
gray
the
great
led
the
brawls
and
seals
and
maces
danced
before
him
the
grave
pavane
likewise
a
favourite
with
the
virgin
queen
and
which
i
should
like
to
see
supersede
the
eternal
polka
at
almack
and
elsewhere
and
in
which
five
was
the
number
of
the
music
feet
which
still
the
dance
did
with
live
paces
meet
the
couranto
with
its
current
traverses
sliding
passages
and
solemn
tune
wherein
according
to
sir
john
davies
that
dancer
greatest
praise
hath
won
who
with
best
order
can
all
order
shun
the
lavolta
also
delineated
by
the
same
knowing
hand
where
arm
in
arm
two
dancers
are
entwined
and
whirl
themselves
with
strict
embracements
bound
their
feet
an
anapest
do
sound
is
not
this
very
much
like
a
waltz
yes
ladies
you
have
been
dancing
the
lavolta
of
the
sixteenth
and
seventeenth
centuries
without
being
aware
of
it
but
there
was
another
waltz
still
older
called
the
sauteuse
which
i
suspect
answered
to
your
favourite
polka
then
there
were
brawls
galliards
paspys
sarabands
of
various
figures
cushion
dances
another
dance
i
long
to
see
revived
kissing
dances
and
rounds
any
of
which
are
better
than
the
objectionable
polka
thus
you
will
see
that
there
was
infinite
variety
at
least
at
the
period
under
consideration
and
that
you
have
rather
retrograded
than
advanced
in
the
saltatory
art
but
to
return
to
the
ball
mistress
nicholas
assheton
i
have
said
excelled
in
the
graceful
accomplishment
of
dancing
and
that
was
probably
the
reason
why
she
had
been
selected
for
the
couranto
by
sir
ralph
who
knew
the
value
of
a
good
partner
by
many
persons
she
was
accounted
the
handsomest
woman
in
the
room
and
in
dignity
of
carriage
she
was
certainly
unrivalled
this
was
precisely
what
sir
ralph
required
and
having
executed
a
few
current
traverses
and
sliding
passages
with
her
with
a
gravity
and
stateliness
worthy
of
sir
christopher
hatton
himself
when
graced
by
the
hand
of
his
sovereign
mistress
he
conducted
her
amid
the
hushed
admiration
of
the
beholders
to
a
seat
still
the
dance
continued
with
unabated
spirit
all
those
engaged
in
it
running
up
and
down
or
turning
and
winding
with
change
alizon
hand
had
been
claimed
by
richard
assheton
and
next
to
the
stately
host
and
his
dignified
partner
they
came
in
for
the
largest
share
of
admiration
and
attention
and
if
the
untutored
girl
fell
short
of
the
accomplished
dame
in
precision
and
skill
she
made
up
for
the
want
of
them
in
natural
grace
and
freedom
of
movement
for
the
display
of
which
the
couranto
with
its
frequent
and
impromptu
changes
afforded
ample
opportunity
even
sir
ralph
was
struck
with
her
extreme
gracefulness
and
pointed
her
out
to
mistress
nicholas
who
unenvying
and
amiable
joined
heartily
in
his
praises
overhearing
what
was
said
nutter
thought
it
a
fitting
opportunity
to
announce
her
intention
of
adopting
the
young
girl
and
though
sir
ralph
seemed
a
good
deal
surprised
at
the
suddenness
of
the
declaration
he
raised
no
objection
to
the
plan
but
on
the
contrary
applauded
it
but
another
person
by
no
means
disposed
to
regard
it
in
an
equally
favourable
light
became
acquainted
with
the
intelligence
at
the
same
time
this
was
master
potts
who
instantly
set
his
wits
at
work
to
discover
its
import
ever
on
the
alert
his
little
eyes
sharp
as
needles
had
detected
jennet
amongst
the
rustic
company
and
he
now
made
his
way
towards
her
resolved
by
dint
of
and
otherwise
to
extract
all
the
information
he
possibly
could
from
her
the
dance
over
richard
and
his
partner
wandered
towards
a
more
retired
part
of
the
hall
why
does
your
sister
shun
me
inquired
alizon
with
a
look
of
great
distress
what
can
i
have
done
to
offend
her
whenever
i
regard
her
she
averts
her
head
and
as
i
approached
her
just
now
she
moved
away
making
it
evident
she
designed
to
avoid
me
if
i
could
think
myself
in
any
way
different
from
what
i
was
this
morning
when
she
treated
me
with
such
unbounded
confidence
and
kindness
or
accuse
myself
of
any
offence
towards
her
even
in
thought
i
could
understand
it
but
as
it
is
her
present
coldness
appears
inexplicable
and
unreasonable
and
gives
me
great
pain
i
would
not
forfeit
her
regard
for
worlds
and
therefore
beseech
you
to
tell
me
what
i
have
done
amiss
that
i
may
endeavour
to
repair
it
you
have
done
nothing
nothing
whatever
sweet
girl
replied
richard
it
is
only
caprice
on
dorothy
part
and
except
that
it
distresses
you
her
conduct
which
you
justly
call
does
not
deserve
a
moment
serious
consideration
oh
no
you
can
not
deceive
me
thus
cried
alizon
she
is
too
kind
too
to
be
capricious
something
must
have
occurred
to
make
her
change
her
opinion
of
me
though
what
it
is
i
can
not
conjecture
i
have
gained
much
more
than
i
had
any
right
to
expect
but
if
i
have
forfeited
the
good
opinion
of
your
sister
the
loss
of
her
friendship
will
counterbalance
all
the
rest
but
you
have
not
lost
it
alizon
replied
richard
earnestly
dorothy
has
got
some
strange
notions
into
her
head
which
only
require
to
be
combated
she
does
not
like
mistress
nutter
and
is
piqued
and
displeased
by
the
extraordinary
interest
which
that
lady
displays
towards
you
that
is
all
but
why
should
she
not
like
mistress
nutter
inquired
alizon
nay
there
is
no
accounting
for
fancies
returned
richard
with
a
faint
smile
i
do
not
attempt
to
defend
her
but
simply
offer
the
only
excuse
in
my
power
for
her
conduct
i
am
concerned
to
hear
it
said
alizon
sadly
because
henceforth
i
shall
be
so
intimately
connected
with
mistress
nutter
that
this
estrangement
which
i
hoped
arose
only
from
some
trivial
cause
and
merely
required
a
little
explanation
to
be
set
aside
may
become
widened
and
lasting
owing
every
thing
to
mistress
nutter
i
must
espouse
her
cause
and
if
your
sister
likes
her
not
she
likes
me
not
in
consequence
and
therefore
we
must
continue
divided
but
surely
her
dislike
is
of
very
recent
date
and
can
not
have
any
strong
hold
upon
her
for
when
she
and
mistress
nutter
met
this
morning
a
very
different
feeling
seemed
to
animate
her
so
indeed
it
did
replied
richard
visibly
embarrassed
and
distressed
and
since
you
have
made
me
acquainted
with
the
new
tie
and
interests
you
have
formed
i
can
only
regret
alluding
to
the
circumstance
that
you
may
not
misunderstand
me
said
alizon
i
will
explain
the
extent
of
my
obligations
to
mistress
nutter
and
then
you
will
perceive
how
much
i
am
bounden
to
her
childless
herself
greatly
interested
in
me
and
feeling
for
my
unfortunate
situation
with
infinite
goodness
of
heart
she
has
declared
her
intention
of
removing
me
from
all
chance
of
baneful
influence
from
the
family
with
whom
i
have
been
heretofore
connected
by
adopting
me
as
her
daughter
i
should
indeed
rejoice
at
this
said
richard
were
it
not
that
and
he
stopped
gazing
anxiously
at
her
were
not
what
cried
alizon
alarmed
by
his
looks
what
do
you
mean
do
not
press
me
further
he
rejoined
i
can
not
answer
you
indeed
i
have
said
too
much
already
you
have
said
too
much
or
too
little
cried
alizon
speak
i
implore
you
what
mean
these
dark
hints
which
you
throw
out
and
which
like
shadows
elude
all
attempts
to
grasp
them
do
not
keep
me
in
this
state
of
suspense
and
agitation
your
looks
speak
more
than
your
words
oh
give
your
thoughts
utterance
i
can
not
replied
richard
i
do
not
believe
what
i
have
heard
and
therefore
will
not
repeat
it
it
would
only
increase
the
mischief
but
oh
tell
me
this
was
it
indeed
to
remove
you
from
the
baneful
influence
of
elizabeth
device
that
mistress
nutter
adopted
you
other
motives
may
have
swayed
her
and
i
have
said
they
did
so
replied
alizon
but
that
wish
no
doubt
had
great
weight
with
her
nay
notwithstanding
her
abhorrence
of
the
family
she
has
kindly
consented
to
use
her
best
endeavours
to
preserve
little
jennet
from
further
ill
as
well
as
to
reclaim
poor
misguided
elizabeth
herself
oh
what
a
weight
you
have
taken
from
my
heart
cried
richard
joyfully
i
will
tell
dorothy
what
you
say
and
it
will
at
once
remove
all
her
doubts
and
suspicions
she
will
now
be
the
same
to
you
as
ever
and
to
mistress
nutter
i
will
not
ask
you
what
those
doubts
and
suspicions
were
since
you
so
confidently
promise
me
this
which
is
all
i
desire
replied
alizon
smiling
but
any
unfavourable
opinions
entertained
of
mistress
nutter
are
wholly
undeserved
poor
lady
she
has
endured
many
severe
trials
and
sufferings
and
whenever
you
learn
the
whole
of
her
history
she
will
i
am
sure
have
your
sincere
sympathy
you
have
certainly
produced
a
complete
revolution
in
my
feelings
towards
her
said
richard
and
i
shall
not
be
easy
till
i
have
made
a
like
convert
of
dorothy
at
this
moment
a
loud
clapping
of
hands
was
heard
and
nicholas
was
seen
marching
towards
the
centre
of
the
hall
preceded
by
the
minstrels
who
had
descended
for
the
purpose
from
the
gallery
and
bearing
in
his
arms
a
large
red
velvet
cushion
as
soon
as
the
dancers
had
formed
a
wide
circle
round
him
a
very
lively
tune
called
joan
sanderson
from
which
the
dance
about
to
be
executed
sometimes
received
its
name
was
struck
up
and
the
squire
after
a
few
preliminary
flourishes
set
down
the
cushion
and
gave
chase
to
dame
tetlow
who
threading
her
way
rapidly
through
the
ring
contrived
to
elude
him
this
chase
accompanied
by
music
excited
shouts
of
laughter
on
all
hands
and
no
one
knew
which
most
to
admire
the
eagerness
of
the
squire
or
the
dexterity
of
the
lissom
dame
in
avoiding
him
exhausted
at
length
and
baffled
in
his
quest
nicholas
came
to
a
halt
before
tom
the
piper
and
taking
up
the
cushion
thus
preferred
his
complaint
this
dance
it
can
no
further
go
no
further
go
whereupon
the
piper
chanted
in
reply
i
pray
you
good
sir
why
say
you
so
why
say
you
so
amidst
general
laughter
the
squire
tenderly
and
touchingly
responded
because
dame
tetlow
will
not
come
to
will
not
come
to
whereupon
tom
the
piper
waxing
furious
blew
a
shrill
whistle
accompanied
by
an
encouraging
rattle
of
the
tambarine
and
enforcing
the
mandate
by
two
or
three
energetic
stamps
on
the
floor
delivered
himself
in
this
fashion
she
come
to
and
she
shall
come
to
and
she
must
come
whether
she
will
or
no
upon
this
two
of
the
prettiest
female
taking
each
a
hand
of
the
blushing
and
overheated
dame
tetlow
for
she
had
found
the
chase
rather
warm
work
led
her
forward
while
the
squire
advancing
very
gallantly
placed
the
cushion
upon
the
ground
before
her
and
as
she
knelt
down
upon
it
bestowed
a
smacking
kiss
upon
her
lips
this
ceremony
being
performed
amidst
much
tittering
and
flustering
accompanied
by
many
knowing
looks
and
some
expressed
wishes
among
the
swains
who
hoped
that
their
turn
might
come
next
dame
tetlow
arose
and
the
squire
seizing
her
hand
they
began
to
whisk
round
in
a
sort
of
jig
singing
merrily
as
they
danced
prinkum
prankum
is
a
fine
dance
and
we
shall
go
dance
it
once
again
once
again
and
we
shall
go
dance
it
once
again
and
they
made
good
the
words
too
for
on
coming
to
a
stop
dame
tetlow
snatched
up
the
cushion
and
ran
in
search
of
the
squire
who
retreating
among
the
surrounding
damsels
made
sad
havoc
among
them
scarcely
leaving
a
pretty
pair
of
lips
unvisited
oh
nicholas
nicholas
i
am
thoroughly
ashamed
of
you
and
regret
becoming
your
historian
you
get
me
into
an
infinitude
of
scrapes
but
there
is
a
rod
in
pickle
for
you
sir
which
shall
be
used
with
good
effect
presently
tired
of
such
an
unprofitable
quest
dame
tetlow
came
to
a
sudden
halt
addressed
the
piper
as
nicholas
had
addressed
him
and
receiving
a
like
answer
summoned
the
delinquent
to
come
forward
but
as
he
knelt
down
on
the
cushion
instead
of
receiving
the
anticipated
salute
he
got
a
sound
box
on
the
ears
the
dame
actuated
probably
by
some
feeling
of
jealousy
taking
advantage
of
the
favourable
opportunity
afforded
her
of
avenging
herself
no
one
could
refrain
from
laughing
at
this
unexpected
turn
in
affairs
and
nicholas
to
do
him
justice
took
it
in
excellent
part
and
laughed
louder
than
the
rest
springing
to
his
feet
he
snatched
the
kiss
denied
him
by
the
spirited
dame
and
led
her
to
obtain
some
refreshment
at
the
lower
table
of
which
they
both
stood
in
need
while
the
cushion
being
appropriated
by
other
couples
other
boxes
on
the
ear
and
kisses
were
interchanged
leading
to
an
infinitude
of
merriment
long
before
this
master
potts
had
found
his
way
to
jennet
and
as
he
drew
near
affecting
to
notice
her
for
the
first
time
he
made
some
remarks
upon
her
not
looking
very
well

the

cleverness
you

a
sharp

jennet
a
very
sharp
child
i
remarked
that
from
the
first
moment
i
saw
you
but
in
regard
to
mistress
nutter
she
seems
a
very
nice
lady
and
must
be
a
very
kind
lady
since
she
has
made
up
her
mind
to
adopt
your
sister
not
that
i
am
surprised
at
her
determination
for
really
alizon

so

so

interrupted
jennet
dunna

sir
no
no
replied
potts
on
the
contrary
there
a
very
great
likeness
between
you
i
saw
you
were
sisters
at
once
i
do
know
which
is
the
cleverest
or
prettiest
but
perhaps
you
are
the
sharpest
yes
you
are
the
sharpest
undoubtedly
jennet
if
i
wished
to
adopt
any
one
which
unfortunately
i
not
in
a
condition
to
do
having
only
chambers
in
chancery
lane
it
should
be
you
but
i
can
put
you

particular
attention
to
what
i
say
and
think
it
over
carefully
when
you
are
by
yourself
you
are
quite
aware
that
there
is
a
great
talk
about
witches
in
these
parts
and
i
may
speak
it
without
offence
to
you
your
own
family

under
the
charge

your
grandmother

instance
a
notorious
witch

jennet
eyeing
him
sharply
what
does

suspicion
tend
to
you

hear
my
little
dear
returned
potts

would
not
surprise
me
if
every
one
of
your
family
including

should
be
arrested
shut
up
in
lancaster
castle
and
burnt
for
witches
alack

day

jennet
derisively
much
obleeged
to
ye
sir
boh
ey
leefer
be
without
the
luck
listen
to
me
pursued
potts
chuckling
and
i
will
point
out
to
you
a
way
of
escaping
the
general
fate
of
your
family
not
merely
of
escaping
it
but
of
acquiring
a
large
reward
and
that
is
by
giving
evidence
against
them
by
telling
all
you
know
you
understand
eh
yeigh
ey
think
ey
onderstond
replied
jennet
sullenly
an
so
this
is
your
grand
scheme
eh
sir
this
is
my
scheme
jennet
said
potts
and
a
notable
scheme
it
is
my
little
lass
think
it
over
you
an
admissible
and
indeed
a
desirable
witness
for
our
sagacious
sovereign
has
expressly
observed
that
i
believe
you
call
children
in
lancashire
jennet
your
uncouth
dialect
very
much
resembles
the
scottish
language
in
which
our
learned
monarch
writes
as
well
as
speaks
says
he
wives
or
never
so
defamed
persons
may
of
our
law
serve
for
sufficient
witnesses
and
proofs
for
who
but
witches
can
be
proofs
and
so
witnesses
of
the
doings
of
witches
boh
ey
am
neaw
witch
ey
tell
ye
mon
cried
jennet
angrily
but
you
a
witch
bairn
my
little
lassy
replied
potts
and
that
just
as
bad
and
you
grow
up
to
be
a
witch
in
due
time
that
is
if
your
career
be
not
cut
short
i
sure
you
must
have
witnessed
some
strange
things
when
you
visited
your
grandmother
at
malkin
tower
that
if
i
mistake
not
is
the
name
of
her
abode
and
a
fearful
and
name
it
is
you
must
have
heard
frequent
mutterings
and
curses
spells
charms
and
diabolical
incantations
beheld
strange
and
monstrous
visions
listened
to
threats
uttered
against
people
who
have
afterwards
perished
unaccountably
ey
heerd
an
seen
nowt
sort
replied
jennet
boh
ey
han
heerd
my
mother
threaten
yo
ah
indeed
cried
potts
forcing
a
laugh
but
looking
rather
blank
afterwards
and
how
did
she
threaten
me
jennet
eh
but
no
matter
let
that
pass
for
the
moment
as
i
was
saying
you
must
have
seen
mysterious
proceedings
both
at
malkin
tower
and
your
own
house
a
black
gentleman
with
a
club
foot
must
visit
you
occasionally
and
your
mother
must
now
and
then
say
once
a
week
take
a
fancy
to
riding
on
a
broomstick
are
you
quite
sure
you
have
never
ridden
on
one
yourself
jennet
and
got
whisked
up
the
chimney
without
being
aware
of
it
the
common
witch
conveyance
and
said
to
be
very
expeditious
and
agreeable
but
i
ca
vouch
for
it
myself
ha
ha
possibly
though
you
are
rather
young
but
possibly
i
say
you
may
have
attended
a
sabbath
and
seen
a
huge
with
four
horns
on
his
head
and
a
large
tail
seated
in
the
midst
of
a
large
circle
of
devoted
admirers
if
you
have
seen
this
and
can
recollect
the
names
and
faces
of
the
assembly
it
would
be
highly
important
when
ey
see
it
ey
shanna
forget
it
replied
jennet
boh
ey
am
nah
quite
so
familiar
wi
owd
scrat
os
yo
seem
to
suppose
has
it
ever
occurred
to
you
that
alizon
might
be
addicted
to
these
practices
pursued
potts
and
that
she
obtained
her
extraordinary
and
otherwise
unaccountable
beauty
by
some
magical
process
some
charm
some
diabolical
unguent
prepared
as
the
lord
keeper
of
the
privy
seals
the
singularly
learned
lord
bacon
declares
from
fat
of
unbaptised
babes
compounded
with
henbane
hemlock
mandrake
moonshade
and
other
terrible
ingredients
she
could
not
be
so
beautiful
without
some
such
aid
that
shows
how
little
yo
knoaw
about
it
replied
jennet
alizon
is
os
good
as
she
protty
and
dunna
yo
think
to
wheedle
me
into
sayin
out
agen
her
fo
yo
winna
do
it
ey
dee
rayther
than
harm
a
hure
o
her
heaod
very
praiseworthy
indeed
my
little
dear
replied
potts
ironically
i
honour
you
for
your
sisterly
affection
but
notwithstanding
all
this
i
can
not
help
thinking
she
has
bewitched
mistress
nutter
licker
mistress
nutter
has
bewitched
her
replied
jennet
then
you
think
mistress
nutter
is
a
witch
eh
cried
potts
eagerly
neaw
tell
ye
what
ey
think
mon
rejoined
jennet
doggedly
but
hear
me
cried
potts
i
have
my
own
suspicions
also
nay
more
than
suspicions
if
ye
shure
yo
dunna
want
me
said
jennet
but
i
want
a
witness
pursued
potts
and
if
you
serve
as
one
whot
ye
gi
me
said
jennet
whatever
you
like
rejoined
potts
only
name
the
sum
so
you
can
prove
the
practice
of
witchcraft
against
mistress
nutter
eh
jennet
nodded
wad
ye
loike
to
knoa
why
brother
jem
is
gone
to
pendle
she
said
very
much
indeed
replied
potts
drawing
still
nearer
to
her
very
much
indeed
the
little
girl
was
about
to
speak
but
on
a
sudden
a
sharp
convulsion
agitated
her
frame
her
utterance
totally
failed
her
and
she
fell
back
in
the
seat
insensible
very
much
startled
potts
flew
in
search
of
some
restorative
and
on
doing
so
he
perceived
mistress
nutter
moving
away
from
this
part
of
the
hall
she
has
done
it
he
cried
a
piece
of
witchcraft
before
my
very
eyes
has
she
killed
the
child
no
she
breathes
and
her
pulse
beats
though
faintly
she
is
only
in
a
swoon
but
a
deep
and
deathlike
one
it
would
be
useless
to
attempt
to
revive
her
she
must
come
to
in
her
own
way
or
at
the
pleasure
of
the
wicked
woman
who
has
thrown
her
into
this
condition
i
have
now
an
assured
witness
in
this
girl
but
i
must
keep
watch
upon
mistress
nutter
further
movements
and
he
walked
cautiously
after
her
as
richard
had
anticipated
his
explanation
was
perfectly
satisfactory
to
dorothy
and
the
young
lady
who
had
suffered
greatly
from
the
restraint
she
had
imposed
upon
herself
flew
to
alizon
and
poured
forth
excuses
which
were
as
readily
accepted
as
they
were
freely
made
they
were
instantly
as
great
friends
as
before
and
their
brief
estrangement
only
seemed
to
make
them
dearer
to
each
other
dorothy
could
not
forgive
herself
and
alizon
assured
her
there
was
nothing
to
be
forgiven
and
so
they
took
hands
upon
it
and
promised
to
forget
all
that
had
passed
richard
stood
by
delighted
with
the
change
and
wrapped
in
the
contemplation
of
the
object
of
his
love
who
thus
engaged
seemed
to
him
more
beautiful
than
he
had
ever
beheld
her
towards
the
close
of
the
evening
while
all
three
were
still
together
nicholas
came
up
and
took
richard
aside
the
squire
looked
flushed
and
there
was
an
undefined
expression
of
alarm
in
his
countenance
what
is
the
matter
inquired
richard
dreading
to
hear
of
some
new
calamity
have
you
not
noticed
it
dick
said
nicholas
in
a
hollow
tone
the
portrait
is
gone
what
portrait
exclaimed
richard
forgetting
the
previous
circumstances
the
portrait
of
isole
de
heton
returned
nicholas
becoming
more
sepulchral
in
his
accents
as
he
proceeded
it
has
vanished
from
the
wall
see
and
believe
who
has
taken
it
down
cried
richard
remarking
that
the
picture
had
certainly
disappeared
no
mortal
hand
replied
nicholas
it
has
come
down
of
itself
i
knew
what
would
happen
dick
i
told
you
the
fair
votaress
gave
me
the
the
wink
you
would
not
believe
me
then
and
now
you
see
your
mistake
i
see
nothing
but
the
bare
wall
said
richard
but
you
will
see
something
anon
dick
rejoined
nicholas
with
a
hollow
laugh
and
in
a
dismally
deep
tone
you
will
see
isole
herself
i
was
foolhardy
enough
to
invite
her
to
dance
the
brawl
with
me
she
smiled
her
assent
and
winked
at
me
thus
very
significantly
i
protest
to
you
and
she
will
be
as
good
as
her
word
absurd
exclaimed
richard
absurd
sayest
thou
thou
art
an
infidel
and
believest
nothing
dick
cried
nicholas
dost
thou
not
see
that
the
picture
is
gone
she
will
be
here
presently
ha
the
brawl
is
called
for
the
very
dance
i
invited
her
to
she
must
be
in
the
room
now
i
will
go
in
search
of
her
look
out
dick
thou
wilt
behold
a
sight
presently
shall
make
thine
hair
stand
on
end
and
he
moved
away
with
a
rapid
but
uncertain
step
the
potent
wine
has
confused
his
brain
said
richard
i
must
see
that
no
mischance
befalls
him
and
waving
his
hand
to
his
sister
he
followed
the
squire
who
moved
on
staring
inquisitively
into
the
countenance
of
every
pretty
damsel
he
encountered
time
had
flown
fleetly
with
dorothy
and
alizon
who
occupied
with
each
other
had
taken
little
note
of
its
progress
and
were
surprised
to
find
how
quickly
the
hours
had
gone
by
meanwhile
several
dances
had
been
performed
a
morisco
in
which
all
the
revellers
took
part
with
the
exception
of
the
queen
herself
who
notwithstanding
the
united
entreaties
of
robin
hood
and
her
could
not
be
prevailed
upon
to
join
it
a
trenchmore
a
sort
of
long
extending
from
top
to
bottom
of
the
hall
and
in
which
the
whole
of
the
rustics
stood
up
a
galliard
confined
to
the
more
important
guests
and
in
which
both
alizon
and
dorothy
were
included
the
former
dancing
of
course
with
richard
and
the
latter
with
one
of
her
cousins
young
joseph
robinson
and
a
jig
quite
promiscuous
and
unexclusive
and
not
the
less
merry
on
that
account
in
this
way
what
with
the
dances
which
were
of
some
duration
the
trenchmore
alone
occupying
more
than
an
hour
and
the
necessary
between
them
it
was
on
the
stroke
of
ten
without
any
body
being
aware
of
it
now
this
though
a
very
early
hour
for
a
modern
party
being
about
the
time
when
the
first
guest
would
arrive
was
a
very
late
one
even
in
fashionable
assemblages
at
the
period
in
question
and
the
guests
began
to
think
of
retiring
when
the
brawl
intended
to
wind
up
the
entertainment
was
called
the
highest
animation
still
prevailed
throughout
the
company
for
the
generous
host
had
taken
care
that
the
intervals
between
the
dances
should
be
well
filled
up
with
refreshments
and
large
bowls
of
spiced
wines
with
burnt
oranges
and
crabs
floating
in
them
were
placed
on
the
and
liberally
dispensed
to
all
applicants
thus
all
seemed
destined
to
be
brought
to
a
happy
conclusion
throughout
the
evening
alizon
had
been
closely
watched
by
mistress
nutter
who
remarked
with
feelings
akin
to
jealousy
and
distrust
the
marked
predilection
exhibited
by
her
for
richard
and
dorothy
assheton
as
well
as
her
inattention
to
her
own
expressed
injunctions
in
remaining
constantly
near
them
though
secretly
displeased
by
this
she
put
a
calm
face
upon
it
and
neither
remonstrated
by
word
or
look
thus
alizon
feeling
encouraged
in
the
course
she
had
adopted
and
prompted
by
her
inclinations
soon
forgot
the
interdiction
she
had
received
mistress
nutter
even
went
so
far
in
her
duplicity
as
to
promise
dorothy
that
alizon
should
pay
her
an
early
visit
at
middleton
though
inwardly
resolving
no
such
visit
should
ever
take
place
however
she
now
received
the
proposal
very
graciously
and
made
alizon
quite
happy
in
acceding
to
it
i
would
fain
have
her
go
back
with
me
to
middleton
when
i
return
said
dorothy
but
i
fear
you
would
not
like
to
part
with
your
daughter
so
soon
neither
would
it
be
quite
fair
to
rob
you
of
her
but
i
shall
hold
you
to
your
promise
of
an
early
visit
mistress
nutter
replied
by
a
bland
smile
and
then
observed
to
alizon
that
it
was
time
for
them
to
retire
and
that
she
had
stayed
on
her
account
far
later
than
she
intended
a
mark
of
consideration
duly
appreciated
by
alizon
farewells
for
the
night
were
then
exchanged
between
the
two
girls
and
alizon
looked
round
to
bid
adieu
to
richard
but
unfortunately
at
this
very
juncture
he
was
engaged
in
pursuit
of
nicholas
before
quitting
the
hall
she
made
inquiries
after
jennet
and
receiving
for
answer
that
she
was
still
in
the
hall
but
had
fallen
asleep
in
a
chair
at
one
corner
of
the
and
could
not
be
wakened
she
instantly
flew
thither
and
tried
to
rouse
her
but
in
vain
when
mistress
nutter
coming
up
the
next
moment
merely
touched
her
brow
and
the
little
girl
opened
her
eyes
and
gazed
about
her
with
a
bewildered
look
she
is
unused
to
these
late
hours
poor
child
said
alizon
some
one
must
be
found
to
take
her
home
you
need
not
go
far
in
search
of
a
convoy
said
potts
who
had
been
hovering
about
and
now
stepped
up
i
am
going
to
the
dragon
myself
and
shall
be
happy
to
take
charge
of
her
you
are
sir
rejoined
mistress
nutter
coldly
when
we
need
your
assistance
we
will
ask
it
my
own
servant
simon
blackadder
will
see
her
safely
home
and
at
a
sign
from
her
a
tall
fellow
with
a
dark
scowling
countenance
came
from
among
the
other
and
receiving
his
instructions
from
his
mistress
seized
jennet
hand
and
strode
off
with
her
during
all
this
time
mistress
nutter
kept
her
eyes
steadily
fixed
on
the
little
girl
who
spoke
not
a
word
nor
replied
even
by
a
gesture
to
alizon
affectionate
retaining
her
dazed
look
to
the
moment
of
quitting
the
hall
i
never
saw
her
thus
before
said
alizon
what
can
be
the
matter
with
her
i
think
i
could
tell
you
rejoined
potts
glancing
maliciously
and
significantly
at
mistress
nutter
the
lady
darted
an
ireful
and
piercing
look
at
him
which
seemed
to
produce
much
the
same
consequences
as
those
experienced
by
jennet
for
his
visage
instantly
elongated
and
he
sank
back
in
a
chair
oh
dear
he
cried
putting
his
hand
to
his
head
i
struck
all
of
a
heap
i
feel
a
sudden
qualm
a
giddiness
a
sort
of
howishness
ho
there
some
aquavitæ
or
imperial
water
or
cinnamon
water
or
whatever
reviving
cordial
may
be
at
hand
i
feel
very
ill
very
ill
indeed
oh
dear
while
his
requirements
were
attended
to
mistress
nutter
moved
away
with
her
daughter
but
they
had
not
proceeded
far
when
they
encountered
richard
who
having
fortunately
descried
them
came
up
to
say
the
brawl
meanwhile
had
commenced
and
the
dancers
were
whirling
round
giddily
in
every
direction
somewhat
like
the
couples
in
a
grand
polka
danced
after
a
very
boisterous
romping
and
extravagant
fashion
who
is
nicholas
dancing
with
asked
mistress
nutter
suddenly
is
he
dancing
with
any
one
rejoined
richard
looking
amidst
the
crowd
do
you
not
see
her
said
mistress
nutter
a
very
beautiful
woman
with
flashing
eyes
they
move
so
quickly
that
i
can
scarce
discern
her
features
but
she
is
habited
like
a
nun
like
a
nun
cried
richard
his
blood
growing
chill
in
his
veins
is
she
indeed
then
where
is
he
yonder
yonder
whirling
madly
round
replied
mistress
nutter
i
see
him
now
said
richard
but
he
is
alone
he
has
lost
his
wits
to
dance
in
that
strange
manner
by
himself
how
wild
too
is
his
gaze
i
tell
you
he
is
dancing
with
a
very
beautiful
woman
in
the
habit
of
a
nun
said
mistress
nutter
strange
i
should
never
have
remarked
her
before
no
one
in
the
room
is
to
be
compared
with
her
in
loveliness
not
even
alizon
her
eyes
seem
to
flash
fire
and
she
bounds
like
the
wild
roe
does
she
resemble
the
portrait
of
isole
de
heton
asked
richard
shuddering
she
does
she
does
replied
mistress
nutter
see
she
whirls
past
us
now
i
can
see
no
one
but
nicholas
cried
richard
nor
i
added
alizon
who
shared
in
the
young
man
alarm
are
you
sure
you
behold
that
figure
said
richard
drawing
mistress
nutter
aside
and
breathing
the
words
in
her
ear
if
so
it
is
a
phantom
or
he
is
in
the
power
of
the
fiend
he
was
rash
enough
to
invite
that
wicked
votaress
isole
de
heton
condemned
it
is
said
to
penal
fires
for
her
earthly
enormities
to
dance
with
him
and
she
has
come
ha
exclaimed
mistress
nutter
she
will
whirl
him
round
till
he
expires
cried
richard
i
must
free
him
at
all
hazards
stay
said
mistress
nutter
it
is
i
who
have
been
deceived
now
i
look
again
i
see
that
nicholas
is
alone
but
the
nun
dress
the
wondrous
beauty
the
flashing
eyes
cried
richard
you
described
isole
exactly
it
was
mere
fancy
said
mistress
nutter
i
had
just
been
looking
at
her
portrait
and
it
dwelt
on
my
mind
and
created
the
image
the
portrait
is
gone
cried
richard
pointing
to
the
empty
wall
mistress
nutter
looked
confounded
and
without
a
word
more
she
took
alizon
who
was
full
of
alarm
and
astonishment
by
the
arm
and
hurried
her
out
of
the
hall
as
they
disappeared
the
young
man
flew
towards
nicholas
whose
extraordinary
proceedings
had
excited
general
amazement
the
other
dancers
had
moved
out
of
the
way
so
that
free
space
was
left
for
his
mad
gyrations
greatly
scandalised
by
the
exhibition
which
he
looked
upon
as
the
effect
of
intoxication
sir
ralph
called
loudly
to
him
to
stop
but
he
paid
no
attention
to
the
summons
but
whirled
on
with
velocity
oversetting
old
adam
whitworth
gregory
and
dickon
who
severally
ventured
to
place
themselves
in
his
path
to
enforce
their
master
injunctions
until
at
last
just
as
richard
reached
him
he
uttered
a
loud
cry
and
fell
to
the
ground
insensible
by
sir
ralph
command
he
was
instantly
lifted
up
and
transported
to
his
own
chamber
this
unexpected
and
extraordinary
incident
put
an
end
to
the
ball
and
the
whole
of
the
guests
after
taking
a
respectful
and
grateful
leave
of
the
host
departed
not
in
most
admired
disorder
but
full
of
wonder
by
most
persons
the
squire
fantastical
vagaries
as
they
were
termed
were
traced
to
the
vast
quantity
of
wine
he
had
drunk
but
a
few
others
shook
their
heads
and
said
he
was
evidently
bewitched
and
that
mother
chattox
and
nance
redferne
were
at
the
bottom
of
it
as
to
the
portrait
of
isole
de
heton
it
was
found
under
the
table
and
it
was
said
that
nicholas
himself
had
pulled
it
down
but
this
he
obstinately
denied
when
afterwards
taken
to
task
for
his
indecorous
behaviour
and
to
his
dying
day
he
asserted
and
believed
that
he
had
danced
the
brawl
with
isole
de
heton
and
never
he
would
say
had
mortal
man
such
a
partner
from
that
night
the
two
portraits
in
the
were
regarded
with
great
awe
by
the
inmates
of
the
abbey
chapter
the
nocturnal
meeting
on
gaining
the
head
of
the
staircase
leading
to
the
corridor
mistress
nutter
whose
movements
had
hitherto
been
extremely
rapid
paused
with
her
daughter
to
listen
to
the
sounds
arising
from
below
suddenly
was
heard
a
loud
cry
and
the
music
which
had
waxed
fast
and
furious
in
order
to
keep
pace
with
the
frenzied
boundings
of
the
squire
ceased
at
once
showing
some
interruption
had
occurred
while
from
the
confused
noise
that
ensued
it
was
evident
the
sudden
stoppage
had
been
the
result
of
accident
with
blanched
cheek
alizon
listened
scarcely
daring
to
look
at
her
mother
whose
expression
of
countenance
revealed
by
the
lamp
she
held
in
her
hand
almost
frightened
her
and
it
was
a
great
relief
to
hear
the
voices
and
laughter
of
the
as
they
came
forth
with
nicholas
and
bore
him
towards
another
part
of
the
mansion
and
though
much
shocked
she
was
glad
when
one
of
them
who
appeared
to
be
nicholas
own
servant
assured
the
others
that
it
was
only
a
drunken
fit
and
that
the
squire
would
wake
up
next
morning
as
if
nothing
had
happened
apparently
satisfied
with
this
explanation
mistress
nutter
moved
on
but
a
new
feeling
of
uneasiness
came
over
alizon
as
she
followed
her
down
the
long
dusky
corridor
in
the
direction
of
the
mysterious
chamber
where
they
were
to
pass
the
night
the
fitful
flame
of
the
lamp
fell
upon
many
a
grim
painting
depicting
the
sufferings
of
the
early
martyrs
and
these
ghastly
representations
did
not
serve
to
her
the
grotesque
carvings
on
the
panels
and
ribs
of
the
vaulted
roof
likewise
impressed
her
with
vague
terror
and
there
was
one
large
piece
of
sculpture
saint
theodora
subjected
to
diabolical
temptation
as
described
in
the
golden
legend
that
absolutely
scared
her
their
footsteps
echoed
hollowly
overhead
and
more
than
once
deceived
by
the
sound
alizon
turned
to
see
if
any
one
was
behind
them
at
the
end
of
the
corridor
lay
the
room
once
occupied
by
the
superior
of
the
religious
establishment
and
still
known
from
that
circumstance
as
the
chamber
connected
with
this
apartment
was
the
beautiful
oratory
built
by
paslew
wherein
he
had
kept
his
last
vigils
and
though
now
no
longer
applied
to
purposes
of
worship
still
wearing
from
the
character
of
its
architecture
its
sculptured
ornaments
and
the
painted
glass
in
its
casements
a
dim
religious
air
the
abbot
room
was
allotted
to
dorothy
assheton
and
from
its
sombre
magnificence
as
well
as
the
ghostly
tales
connected
with
it
had
impressed
her
with
so
much
superstitious
misgiving
that
she
besought
alizon
to
share
her
couch
with
her
but
the
young
girl
did
not
dare
to
assent
just
however
as
mistress
nutter
was
about
to
enter
her
own
room
dorothy
appeared
on
the
corridor
and
calling
to
alizon
to
stay
a
moment
flew
quickly
towards
her
and
renewed
the
proposition
alizon
looked
at
her
mother
but
the
latter
decidedly
and
somewhat
sternly
negatived
it
the
young
girls
then
said
kissing
each
other
affectionately
after
which
alizon
entered
the
room
with
mistress
nutter
and
the
door
was
closed
two
tapers
were
burning
on
the
and
their
light
fell
upon
the
carved
figures
of
the
wardrobe
which
still
exercised
the
same
weird
influence
over
her
mistress
nutter
neither
seemed
disposed
to
retire
to
rest
immediately
nor
willing
to
talk
but
sat
down
and
was
soon
lost
in
thought
after
awhile
an
impulse
of
curiosity
which
she
could
not
resist
prompted
alizon
to
peep
into
the
closet
and
pushing
aside
the
tapestry
partly
drawn
over
the
entrance
she
held
the
lamp
forward
so
as
to
throw
its
light
into
the
little
chamber
a
mere
glance
was
all
she
was
allowed
but
it
sufficed
to
show
her
the
large
oak
chest
though
the
monkish
robe
lately
suspended
above
it
and
which
had
particularly
attracted
her
attention
was
gone
mistress
nutter
had
noticed
the
movement
and
instantly
and
somewhat
sharply
recalled
her
as
alizon
obeyed
a
slight
tap
was
heard
at
the
door
the
young
girl
turned
pale
for
in
her
present
frame
of
mind
any
little
matter
affected
her
nor
were
her
apprehensions
materially
allayed
by
the
entrance
of
dorothy
who
looking
white
as
a
sheet
said
she
did
not
dare
to
remain
in
her
own
room
having
been
terribly
frightened
by
seeing
a
monkish
figure
in
mouldering
white
garments
exactly
resembling
one
of
the
carved
images
on
the
wardrobe
issue
from
behind
the
hangings
on
the
wall
and
glide
into
the
oratory
and
she
entreated
mistress
nutter
to
let
alizon
go
back
with
her
the
request
was
peremptorily
refused
and
the
lady
ridiculing
dorothy
for
her
fears
bade
her
return
but
she
still
lingered
this
relation
filled
alizon
with
inexpressible
alarm
for
though
she
did
not
dare
to
allude
to
the
disappearance
of
the
monkish
gown
she
could
not
help
connecting
the
circumstance
with
the
ghostly
figure
seen
by
dorothy
unable
otherwise
to
get
rid
of
the
terrified
intruder
whose
presence
was
an
evident
restraint
to
her
mistress
nutter
at
length
consented
to
accompany
her
to
her
room
and
convince
her
of
the
folly
of
her
fears
by
an
examination
of
the
oratory
alizon
went
with
them
her
mother
not
choosing
to
leave
her
behind
and
indeed
she
herself
was
most
anxious
to
go
the
abbot
chamber
was
large
and
gloomy
nearly
twice
the
size
of
the
room
occupied
by
mistress
nutter
but
resembling
it
in
many
respects
as
well
as
in
the
no
interdusky
hue
of
its
hangings
and
furniture
most
of
which
had
been
undisturbed
since
the
days
of
paslew
the
very
bed
of
carved
oak
was
that
in
which
he
had
slept
and
his
arms
were
still
displayed
upon
it
and
on
the
painted
glass
of
the
windows
as
alizon
entered
she
looked
round
with
apprehension
but
nothing
occurred
to
justify
her
uneasiness
having
raised
the
arras
from
behind
which
dorothy
averred
the
figure
had
issued
and
discovering
nothing
but
a
panel
of
oak
with
a
smile
of
incredulity
mistress
nutter
walked
boldly
towards
the
oratory
the
two
girls
hand
in
hand
following
tremblingly
after
her
but
no
fearful
object
met
their
view
a
with
a
large
mirror
upon
it
occupied
the
spot
where
the
altar
had
formerly
stood
but
in
spite
of
this
and
of
other
furniture
the
little
place
of
prayer
as
has
previously
been
observed
retained
much
of
its
original
character
and
seemed
more
calculated
to
inspire
sentiments
of
devotional
awe
than
any
other
after
remaining
for
a
short
time
in
the
oratory
during
which
she
pointed
out
the
impossibility
of
any
one
being
concealed
there
mistress
nutter
assured
dorothy
she
might
rest
quite
easy
that
nothing
further
would
occur
to
alarm
her
and
recommending
her
to
lose
the
sense
of
her
fears
as
speedily
as
she
could
in
sleep
took
her
departure
with
alizon
but
the
recommendation
was
of
little
avail
the
poor
girl
heart
died
within
her
and
all
her
former
terrors
returned
and
with
additional
force
sitting
down
she
looked
fixedly
at
the
hangings
till
her
eyes
ached
and
then
covering
her
face
with
her
hands
and
scarcely
daring
to
breathe
she
listened
intently
for
the
slightest
sound
a
rustle
would
have
made
her
scream
but
all
was
still
as
death
so
profoundly
quiet
that
the
very
hush
and
silence
became
a
new
cause
of
disquietude
and
longing
for
some
cheerful
sound
to
break
it
she
would
have
spoken
aloud
but
from
a
fear
of
hearing
her
own
voice
a
book
lay
before
her
and
she
essayed
to
read
it
but
in
vain
she
was
ever
glancing
fearfully
round
ever
listening
intently
this
state
could
not
endure
for
ever
and
feeling
a
drowsiness
steal
over
her
she
yielded
to
it
and
at
length
dropped
asleep
in
her
chair
her
dreams
however
were
influenced
by
her
mental
condition
and
slumber
was
no
refuge
as
promised
by
mistress
nutter
from
the
hauntings
of
terror
at
last
a
jarring
sound
aroused
her
and
she
found
she
had
been
awakened
by
the
clock
striking
twelve
her
lamp
required
trimming
and
burnt
dimly
but
by
its
imperfect
light
she
saw
the
arras
move
this
could
be
no
fancy
for
the
next
moment
the
hangings
were
raised
and
a
figure
looked
from
behind
them
and
this
time
it
was
not
the
monk
but
a
female
robed
in
white
a
glimpse
of
the
figure
was
all
dorothy
caught
for
it
instantly
retreated
and
the
tapestry
fell
back
to
its
place
against
the
wall
scared
by
this
apparition
dorothy
rushed
out
of
the
room
so
hurriedly
that
she
forgot
to
take
her
lamp
and
made
her
way
she
scarcely
knew
how
to
the
adjoining
chamber
she
did
not
tap
at
the
door
but
trying
it
and
finding
it
unfastened
opened
it
softly
and
closed
it
after
her
resolved
if
the
occupants
of
the
room
were
asleep
not
to
disturb
them
but
to
pass
the
night
in
a
chair
the
presence
of
some
living
beings
beside
her
sufficing
in
some
degree
to
dispel
her
terrors
the
room
was
buried
in
darkness
the
tapers
being
extinguished
advancing
on
tiptoe
she
soon
discovered
a
seat
when
what
was
her
surprise
to
find
alizon
asleep
within
it
she
was
sure
it
was
alizon
for
she
had
touched
her
hair
and
face
and
she
felt
surprised
that
the
contact
had
not
awakened
her
still
more
surprised
did
she
feel
that
the
young
girl
had
not
retired
to
rest
again
she
stepped
forward
in
search
of
another
chair
when
a
gleam
of
light
suddenly
shot
from
one
side
of
the
bed
and
the
tapestry
masking
the
entrance
to
the
closet
was
slowly
drawn
aside
from
behind
it
the
next
moment
appeared
the
same
female
figure
robed
in
white
that
she
had
previously
beheld
in
the
abbot
chamber
the
figure
held
a
lamp
in
one
hand
and
a
small
box
in
the
other
and
to
her
unspeakable
horror
disclosed
the
livid
and
contorted
countenance
of
mistress
nutter
illustration
alizon
alarmed
at
the
appearance
of
mrs
nutter
dreadful
though
undefined
suspicions
crossed
her
mind
and
she
feared
if
discovered
she
should
be
sacrificed
to
the
fury
of
this
strange
and
terrible
woman
luckily
where
she
stood
though
mistress
nutter
was
revealed
to
her
she
herself
was
screened
from
view
by
the
hangings
of
the
bed
and
looking
around
for
a
she
observed
that
the
mysterious
wardrobe
close
behind
her
was
open
and
without
a
hesitation
she
slipped
into
the
covert
and
drew
the
door
to
noiselessly
but
her
curiosity
overmastered
her
fear
and
firmly
believing
some
magical
rite
was
about
to
be
performed
she
sought
for
means
of
beholding
it
nor
was
she
long
in
discovering
a
small
in
the
carving
which
commanded
the
room
unconscious
of
any
other
presence
than
that
of
alizon
whose
stupor
appeared
to
occasion
her
no
uneasiness
mistress
nutter
placed
the
lamp
upon
the
table
made
fast
the
door
and
muttering
some
unintelligible
words
unlocked
the
box
it
contained
two
glass
vessels
the
one
filled
with
a
bright
sparkling
liquid
and
the
other
with
a
unguent
pouring
forth
a
few
drops
of
the
liquid
into
a
glass
near
her
mistress
nutter
swallowed
them
and
then
taking
some
of
the
unguent
upon
her
hands
proceeded
to
anoint
her
face
and
neck
with
it
exclaiming
as
she
did
so
emen
hetan
emen
hetan
words
that
fixed
themselves
upon
the
listener
memory
wondering
what
would
follow
dorothy
gazed
on
when
she
suddenly
lost
sight
of
mistress
nutter
and
after
looking
for
her
as
far
as
her
range
of
vision
limited
by
the
aperture
would
extend
she
became
convinced
that
she
had
left
the
room
all
remaining
quiet
she
ventured
after
awhile
to
quit
her
and
flying
to
alizon
tried
to
waken
her
but
in
vain
the
poor
girl
retained
the
same
moveless
attitude
and
appeared
plunged
in
a
deathly
stupor
much
frightened
dorothy
resolved
to
alarm
the
house
but
some
fears
of
mistress
nutter
restrained
her
and
she
crept
towards
the
closet
to
see
whether
that
dread
lady
could
be
there
all
was
perfectly
still
and
somewhat
emboldened
she
returned
to
the
table
where
the
box
which
was
left
open
and
its
contents
unguarded
attracted
her
attention
what
was
the
liquid
in
the
phial
what
could
it
do
these
were
questions
she
asked
herself
and
longing
to
try
the
effect
she
ventured
at
last
to
pour
forth
a
few
drops
and
taste
it
it
was
like
a
potent
distillation
and
she
became
instantly
sensible
of
a
strange
bewildering
excitement
presently
her
brain
reeled
and
she
laughed
wildly
never
before
had
she
felt
so
light
and
buoyant
and
wings
seemed
scarcely
wanting
to
enable
her
to
fly
an
idea
occurred
to
her
the
wondrous
liquid
might
arouse
alizon
the
experiment
should
be
tried
at
once
and
dipping
her
finger
in
the
phial
she
touched
the
lips
of
the
sleeper
who
sighed
deeply
and
opened
her
eyes
another
drop
and
alizon
was
on
her
feet
gazing
at
her
in
astonishment
and
laughing
wildly
as
herself
poor
girls
how
wild
and
strange
they
looked
and
how
unlike
themselves
whither
are
you
going
cried
alizon
to
the
moon
to
the
stars
any
where
rejoined
dorothy
with
a
laugh
of
frantic
glee
i
will
go
with
you
cried
alizon
echoing
the
laugh
here
and
there
here
and
there
exclaimed
dorothy
taking
her
hand
emen
hetan
emen
hetan
as
the
mystic
words
were
uttered
they
started
away
it
seemed
as
if
no
impediments
could
stop
them
how
they
crossed
the
closet
passed
through
a
sliding
panel
into
the
abbot
room
entered
the
oratory
and
from
it
descended
by
a
secret
staircase
to
the
garden
they
knew
not
but
there
they
were
gliding
swiftly
along
in
the
moonlight
like
winged
spirits
what
took
them
towards
the
conventual
church
they
could
not
say
but
they
were
drawn
thither
as
the
ship
was
irresistibly
dragged
towards
the
loadstone
rock
described
in
the
eastern
legend
nothing
surprised
them
then
or
they
might
have
been
struck
by
the
dense
vapour
enveloping
the
monastic
ruins
and
shrouding
them
from
view
nor
was
it
until
they
entered
the
desecrated
fabric
that
any
consciousness
of
what
was
passing
around
returned
to
them
their
ears
were
then
assailed
by
a
wild
hubbub
of
discordant
sounds
hootings
and
croakings
as
of
owls
and
ravens
shrieks
and
jarring
cries
as
of
bellowings
as
of
cattle
groans
and
dismal
sounds
mixed
with
unearthly
laughter
undefined
and
extraordinary
shapes
whether
men
or
women
beings
of
this
world
or
of
another
they
could
not
tell
though
they
judged
them
the
latter
flew
past
with
wild
whoops
and
piercing
cries
flapping
the
air
as
if
with
great
leathern
wings
or
bestriding
black
monstrous
misshapen
steeds
fantastical
and
grotesque
were
these
objects
yet
hideous
and
appalling
now
and
then
a
red
and
fiery
star
would
whiz
crackling
through
the
air
and
then
exploding
break
into
numerous
pale
phosphoric
lights
that
danced
awhile
overhead
and
then
flitted
away
among
the
ruins
the
ground
seemed
to
heave
and
tremble
beneath
the
footsteps
as
if
the
graves
were
opening
to
give
forth
their
dead
while
toads
and
hissing
reptiles
crept
forth
appalled
yet
partly
restored
to
herself
by
this
confused
and
horrible
din
alizon
stood
still
and
kept
fast
hold
of
dorothy
who
seemingly
under
a
stronger
influence
than
herself
was
drawn
towards
the
eastern
end
of
the
fane
where
a
fire
appeared
to
be
blazing
a
strong
ruddy
glare
being
cast
upon
the
broken
roof
of
the
choir
and
the
mouldering
arches
around
it
the
noises
around
them
suddenly
ceased
and
all
the
uproar
seemed
concentrated
near
the
spot
where
the
fire
was
burning
dorothy
besought
her
friend
so
earnestly
to
let
her
see
what
was
going
forward
that
alizon
reluctantly
and
tremblingly
assented
and
they
moved
slowly
towards
the
transept
taking
care
to
keep
under
the
shelter
of
the
columns
on
reaching
the
last
pillar
behind
which
they
remained
an
extraordinary
and
fearful
spectacle
burst
upon
them
as
they
had
supposed
a
large
fire
was
burning
in
the
midst
of
the
choir
the
smoke
of
which
ascending
in
eddying
wreaths
formed
a
dark
canopy
overhead
where
it
was
mixed
with
the
steam
issuing
from
a
large
black
bubbling
caldron
set
on
the
blazing
embers
around
the
fire
were
ranged
in
a
wide
circle
an
assemblage
of
men
and
women
but
chiefly
the
latter
and
of
these
almost
all
old
hideous
and
of
malignant
aspect
their
grim
and
sinister
features
looking
ghastly
in
the
lurid
light
above
them
amid
the
smoke
and
steam
wheeled
bat
and
horned
owl
and
in
mazy
circles
the
weird
assemblage
chattered
together
in
some
wild
jargon
mumbling
and
muttering
spells
and
incantations
chanting
fearfully
with
hoarse
cracked
voices
a
wild
chorus
and
anon
breaking
into
a
loud
and
peal
of
laughter
then
there
was
more
mumbling
chattering
and
singing
and
one
of
the
troop
producing
a
wallet
hobbled
forward
she
was
a
fearful
old
crone
hunchbacked
toothless
bearded
halt
with
huge
gouty
feet
swathed
in
flannel
as
she
cast
in
the
ingredients

over

he
cried
advancing
as
the
old
witch
retired
amidst
a

of
laughter
from
the
others
and
chanting

filled
the

advanced
and
taking
from

a
small

image
tricked
out
in
attire
intended
to
resemble
that
of
james

plunged
several
pins
deeply

this
night
as

of

followed
this

as
the
words
were
uttered
a
woman
stepped
from
out
the
circle
and
throwing
back
the
cloak
in
which
she
was
enveloped
disclosed
the
features
of
elizabeth
device
her
presence
in
that
fearful
assemblage
occasioned
no
surprise
to
alizon
though
it
increased
her
horror
a
pail
of
water
was
next
set
before
the
witch
and
a
broom
being
placed
in

she

illustration
the
incantation
as
she
concluded
clouds
gathered
thickly
overhead
obscuring
the
stars
that
had
hitherto
shone
down
from
the
heavens
the
wind
suddenly
arose
but
in
lieu
of
dispersing
the
vapours
it
seemed
only
to
condense
them
a
flash
of
forked
lightning
cut
through
the
air
and
a
loud
peal
of
thunder
rolled
overhead
then
the
whole
troop
sang
together
beat
the
water
demdike
daughter
see
the
tempests
gathers

lightning

thunder

wild
winds
sing
in
lusty
chorus
for
a
brief
space
the
storm
raged
fearfully
and
recalled
the
terror
of
that
previously
witnessed
by
alizon
which
she
now
began
to
think
might
have
originated
in
a
similar
manner
the
wind
raved
around
the
ruined
pile
but
its
breath
was
not
felt
within
it
and
the
rain
was
heard
descending
in
deluging
showers
without
though
no
drop
came
through
the
open
roof
the
thunder
shook
the
walls
and
pillars
of
the
old
fabric
and
threatened
to
topple
them
down
from
their
foundations
but
they
resisted
the
shocks
the
lightning
played
around
the
tall
spire
springing
from
this
part
of
the
fane
and
ran
down
from
its
shattered
summit
to
its
base
without
doing
any
damage
the
red
bolts
struck
the
ground
innocuously
though
they
fell
at
the
very
feet
of
the
weird
assemblage
who
laughed
wildly
at
the
awful
tumult
whilst
the
storm
was
at
its
worst
while
the
lightning
was
flashing
fiercely
and
the
thunder
rattling
loudly
mother
chattox
with
a
in
her
hand
advanced
towards
the
fire
and
placing
the
pan
upon
it
threw
certain
herbs
and
roots
into
it
chanting
thus

potent
invocation

all
who

appear
after
a
moment
pause
she
resumed
as
follows
brethren
who
of
old
nightly
paced
yon
cloisters
cold
sleeping
now
beneath
the
mould
i
bid
ye
rise

who

thy
snowy

i
bid
thee
come
during
this
invocation
the
glee
of
the
assemblage
ceased
and
they
looked
around
in
hushed
expectation
of
the
result
slowly
then
did
a
long
procession
of
monkish
forms
robed
in
white
glide
along
the
aisles
and
gather
round
the
altar
the
stones
within
the
presbytery
were
lifted
up
as
if
they
moved
on
hinges
and
from
the
yawning
graves
beneath
them
arose
solemn
shapes
sixteen
in
number
each
with
mitre
on
head
and
crosier
in
hand
which
likewise
proceeded
to
the
altar
then
a
loud
cry
was
heard
and
from
a
side
chapel
burst
the
monkish
form
in
mouldering
garments
which
dorothy
had
seen
enter
the
oratory
and
which
would
have
mingled
with
its
brethren
at
the
altar
but
they
waved
it
off
menacingly
another
piercing
shriek
followed
and
a
female
shape
habited
like
a
nun
and
of
surpassing
loveliness
issued
from
the
opposite
chapel
and
hovered
near
the
fire
content
with
this
proof
of
her
power
mother
chattox
waved
her
hand
and
the
long
shadowy
train
glided
off
as
they
came
the
ghostly
abbots
returned
to
their
tombs
and
the
stones
closed
over
them
but
the
shades
of
paslew
and
isole
de
heton
still
lingered
the
storm
had
wellnigh
ceased
the
thunder
rolled
hollowly
at
intervals
and
a
flash
of
lightning
now
and
then
licked
the
walls
the
weird
crew
had
resumed
their
rites
when
the
door
of
the
lacy
chapel
flew
open
and
a
tall
female
figure
came
forward
alizon
doubted
if
she
beheld
aright
could
that
terrific
woman
in
the
robe
of
white
girt
by
a
brazen
zone
graven
with
mystic
characters
with
a
long
glittering
blade
in
her
hand
infernal
fury
in
her
orbs
the
livid
hue
of
death
on
her
cheeks
and
the
red
brand
upon
her
brow
could
that
fearful
woman
with
the
black
dishevelled
tresses
floating
over
her
bare
shoulders
and
whose
gestures
were
so
imperious
be
mistress
nutter
mother
no
longer
if
it
indeed
were
she
how
came
she
there
amid
that
weird
assemblage
why
did
they
so
humbly
salute
her
and
fall
prostrate
before
her
kissing
the
hem
of
her
garment
why
did
she
stand
proudly
in
the
midst
of
them
and
extend
her
hand
armed
with
the
knife
over
them
was
she
their
sovereign
mistress
that
they
bent
so
lowly
at
her
coming
and
rose
so
reverentially
at
her
bidding
was
this
terrible
woman
now
seated
oh
a
dilapidated
tomb
and
regarding
the
dark
conclave
with
the
eye
of
a
queen
who
held
their
lives
in
her
hands
was
she
her
mother
oh
no
no
it
could
not
be
it
must
be
some
fiend
that
usurped
her
likeness
still
though
alizon
thus
strove
to
discredit
the
evidence
of
her
senses
and
to
hold
all
she
saw
to
be
delusion
and
the
work
of
darkness
she
could
not
entirely
convince
herself
but
imperfectly
recalling
the
fearful
vision
she
had
witnessed
during
her
former
stupor
began
to
connect
it
with
the
scene
now
passing
before
her
the
storm
had
wholly
ceased
and
the
stars
again
twinkled
down
through
the
shattered
roof
deep
silence
prevailed
broken
only
by
the
hissing
and
bubbling
of
the
caldron
alizon
gaze
was
riveted
upon
her
mother
whose
slightest
gestures
she
watched
after
numbering
the
assemblage
thrice
mistress
nutter
majestically
arose
and
motioning
mother
chattox
towards
her
the
old
witch
tremblingly
advanced
and
some
words
passed
between
them
the
import
of
which
did
not
reach
the
listener
ear
in
conclusion
however
mistress
nutter
exclaimed
aloud
in
accents
of
command
go
bring
it
at
once
the
sacrifice
must
be
made
and
on
this
mother
chattox
hobbled
off
to
one
of
the
side
chapels
a
mortal
terror
seized
alizon
and
she
could
scarcely
draw
breath
dark
tales
had
been
told
her
that
unbaptised
infants
were
sometimes
sacrificed
by
witches
and
their
flesh
boiled
and
devoured
at
their
impious
banquets
and
dreading
lest
some
such
atrocity
was
now
about
to
be
practised
she
mustered
all
her
resolution
determined
at
any
risk
to
interfere
and
if
possible
prevent
its
accomplishment
in
another
moment
mother
chattox
returned
bearing
some
living
thing
wrapped
in
a
white
cloth
which
struggled
feebly
for
liberation
apparently
confirming
alizon
suspicions
and
she
was
about
to
rush
forward
when
mistress
nutter
snatching
the
bundle
from
the
old
witch
opened
it
and
disclosed
a
beautiful
bird
with
plumage
white
as
driven
snow
whose
legs
were
tied
together
so
that
it
could
not
escape
conjecturing
what
was
to
follow
alizon
averted
her
eyes
and
when
she
looked
round
again
the
bird
had
been
slain
while
mother
chattox
was
in
the
act
of
throwing
its
body
into
the
caldron
muttering
a
charm
as
she
did
so
mistress
nutter
held
the
ensanguined
knife
aloft
and
casting
some
ruddy
drops
upon
the
glowing
embers
pronounced
as
they
hissed
and
smoked
the
following
adjuration
thy
aid
i
seek
infernal
power
be
thy
word
sent
to
malkin
tower
that
the
beldame
old
may
know
where
i
will
have
her
go
what
i
will
have
her
do
an
immediate
response
was
made
by
an
awful
voice
issuing
apparently
from
the
bowels
of
the
earth
thou
who
the
demon
aid
the
price
that
must
be
paid
the
queen
witch
rejoined
i
do
but
grant
the

i
crave
and
that
thou
wishest
thou
shalt
have
another
worshipper
is
won
thine
to
be
when
all
is
done
again
the
deep
voice
spake
with
something
of
mockery
in
its
accents
enough
proud
witch
i
am
content
to

mistress

whose

gleamed
with
fierce
exultation
bring
forth
the
proselyte
she
shouted
and
at
the
words
her
swarthy
blackadder
came
forth
from
the
lacy
chapel
leading
jennet
by
the
hand
they
were
followed
by
tib
who
dilated
to
twice
his
former
size
walked
with
tail
erect
and
eyes
glowing
like
carbuncles
at
sight
of
her
daughter
a
loud
cry
of
rage
and
astonishment
burst
from
elizabeth
device
and
rushing
forward
she
would
have
seized
her
if
tib
had
not
kept
her
off
by
a
formidable
display
of
teeth
and
talons
jennet
made
no
effort
to
join
her
mother
but
regarded
her
with
a
malicious
and
triumphant
grin

mistress

elizabeth
who
was
still
kept
at
bay
by
tib
shaking
her
arms
and
gnashing
her
teeth
in
impotent
rage
now
groaned
aloud
but
ere
jennet
could
answer
a
piercing
cry
was
heard
which
thrilled
through
mistress
nutter
bosom
and
alizon
rushing
from
her
place
of
concealment
passed
through
the
weird
circle
and
stood
beside
the
group
in
the
midst
of
it
forbear
jennet
she
cried
forbear
pronounce
not
those
impious
words
or
you
are
lost
for

sister
alizon
cried
jennet
staring
at
her
in
surprise
what
makes

here
do
not
ask
but
come
cried
alizon
trying
to
take
her
hand
oh
what
is
this
cried
mistress
nutter
now
partly
recovered
from
the
consternation
and
astonishment
into
which
she
had
been
thrown
by
alizon
unexpected
appearance
why
are
you
here
how
have
you
broken
the
chains
of
slumber
in
which
i
bound
you

the
voice

laughter
cried
mistress
nutter
with
a
haggard
look
go
never
without
jennet
replied
alizon
firmly
my
child
my
child

implore
you
to

cried
mistress
nutter
throwing
herself
before
her
you

alizon
continued
inflexible

with
a
taunting
laugh

ha
ha
curses
upon
thy
malice
cried
mistress
nutter
rising
what
can
be
done
in
this
extremity
nothing
replied
the
voice
jennet
is
mine
already
if
not
brought
hither
by
thee
or
by
her
mother
she
would
have
come
of
her
own
accord
i
have
watched
her
and
marked
her
for
my
own
besides
she
is
fated
the
curse
of
paslew
clings
to
her
as
the
words
were
uttered
the
shade
of
the
abbot
glided
forwards
and
touching
the
shuddering
child
upon
the
brow
with
its
finger
vanished
with
a
lamentable
cry
kneel
jennet
cried
alizon
kneel
and
pray
to
me
rejoined
the
voice
she
can
bend
to
no
other
power
alice
nutter
thou
hast
sought
to
deceive
me
but
in
vain
i
bade
thee
bring
thy
daughter
here
and
in
place
of
her
thou
offerest
me
the
child
of
another
who
is
mine
already
i
am
not
to
be
thus
trifled
with
thou
knowest
my
will
sprinkle
water
over
her
head
and
devote
her
to
me
alizon
would
fain
have
thrown
herself
on
her
knees
but
extremity
of
horror
or
some
overmastering
influence
held
her
fast
and
she
remained
with
her
gaze
fixed
upon
her
mother
who
seemed
torn
by
conflicting
emotions
is
there
no
way
to
avoid
this
cried
mistress
nutter
no
way
but
one
replied
the
voice
i
have
been
offered
a
new
devotee
and
i
claim
fulfilment
of
the
promise
thy
daughter
or
another
it
matters
not
but
not
jennet
i
embrace
the
alternative
cried
mistress
nutter
it
must
be
done
upon
the
instant
said
the
voice
it
shall
be
replied
mistress
nutter
and
stretching
her
arm
in
the
direction
of
the
mansion
she
called
in
a
loud
imperious
voice
dorothy
assheton
come
hither
a
minute
elapsed
but
no
one
appeared
and
with
a
look
of
disappointment
mistress
nutter
repeated
the
gesture
and
the
words
still
no
one
came
baffled
she
exclaimed
what
can
it
mean
there
is
a
maiden
within
the
south
transept
who
is
not
one
of
my
servants
cried
the
voice
call
her
is
she
cried
mistress
nutter
stretching
her
arm
towards
the
transept
this
time
i
am
answered
she
added
as
with
a
wild
laugh
dorothy
obeyed
the
summons
i
have
anointed
myself
with
the
unguent
and
drank
of
the
potion
ha
ha
ha
cried
dorothy
with
a
wild
gesture
and
wilder
laughter
ha
this
accounts
for
her
presence
here
muttered
mistress
nutter
but
it
could
not
be
better
she
is
in
no
mood
to
offer
resistance
dorothy
thou
shalt
be
a
witch
a
witch
exclaimed
the
bewildered
maiden
is
alizon
a
witch
we
are
all
witches
here
replied
mistress
nutter
alizon
had
no
power
to
contradict
her
a
merry
company
exclaimed
dorothy
laughing
loudly
you
will
say
so
anon
replied
mistress
nutter
waving
her
hand
over
her
and
muttering
a
spell
but
you
see
them
not
in
their
true
forms
dorothy
look
again
what
do
you
behold
now
in
place
of
a
troop
of
old
wrinkled
crones
in
wretched
habiliments
replied
dorothy
i
behold
a
band
of
lovely
nymphs
in
light
gauzy
attire
wreathed
with
flowers
and
holding
myrtle
and
olive
branches
in
their
hands
see
they
rise
and
prepare
for
the
dance
strains
of
ravishing
music
salute
the
ear
i
never
heard
sounds
so
sweet
and
stirring
the
round
is
formed
the
dance
begins
how
gracefully
how
lightly
they
move
ha
ha
alizon
could
not
check
her
could
not
undeceive
her
for
power
of
speech
as
of
movement
was
denied
her
but
she
comprehended
the
strange
delusion
under
which
the
poor
girl
laboured
the
figures
dorothy
described
as
young
and
lovely
were
still
to
her
the
same
loathsome
and
abhorrent
witches
the
ravishing
music
jarred
discordantly
on
her
ear
as
if
produced
by
a
shrill
cornemuse
and
the
lightsome
dance
was
a
fantastic
round
performed
with
shouts
and
laughter
by
the
whole
unhallowed
crew
jennet
laughed
immoderately
and
seemed
delighted
by
the
antics
of
the
troop
ey
never
wished
to
dance
efore
she
cried
boh
ey
should
like
to
try
now
join
them
then
said
mistress
nutter
and
to
the
little
girl
infinite
delight
a
place
was
made
for
her
in
the
round
and
taking
hands
with
mother
and
the
witch
she
footed
it
as
merrily
as
the
rest
who
is
she
in
the
nunlike
habit
inquired
dorothy
pointing
to
the
shade
of
isole
de
heton
which
still
hovered
near
the
weird
assemblage
she
seems
more
beautiful
than
all
the
others
will
she
not
dance
with
me
heed
her
not
said
mistress
nutter
dorothy
however
would
not
be
gainsaid
but
spite
of
the
caution
beckoned
the
figure
towards
her
it
came
at
once
and
in
another
instant
its
arms
were
enlaced
around
her
the
same
frenzy
that
had
seized
nicholas
now
took
possession
of
dorothy
and
her
dance
with
isole
might
have
come
to
a
similar
conclusion
if
it
had
not
been
abruptly
checked
by
mistress
nutter
who
waving
her
hand
and
pronouncing
a
spell
the
figure
instantly
quitted
dorothy
and
with
a
wild
shriek
fled
how
like
you
these
diversions
said
mistress
nutter
to
the
panting
and
almost
breathless
maiden
marvellously
replied
dorothy
but
why
have
you
scared
my
partner
away
because
she
would
have
done
you
a
mischief
rejoined
mistress
nutter
but
now
let
me
put
a
question
to
you
are
you
willing
to
renounce
your
baptism
and
enter
into
a
covenant
with
the
prince
of
darkness
dorothy
did
not
seem
in
the
least
to
comprehend
what
was
said
to
her
but
she
nevertheless
replied
i
am
bring
water
and
salt
said
mistress
nutter
to
mother
chattox
by
these
drops
i
baptise
you
she
added
dipping
her
fingers
in
the
liquid
and
preparing
to
sprinkle
it
over
the
brow
of
the
proselyte
then
it
was
that
alizon
by
an
almost
superhuman
effort
burst
the
spell
that
bound
her
and
clasped
dorothy
in
her
arms
you
know
not
what
you
do
dear
dorothy
she
cried
i
answer
for
you
you
will
not
yield
to
the
snares
and
temptations
of
satan
however
subtly
devised
you
defy
him
and
all
his
works
you
will
make
no
covenant
with
him
though
surrounded
by
his
you
fear
him
not
is
it
not
so
speak
but
dorothy
could
only
answer
with
an
insane
laugh
i
will
be
a
witch
it
is
too
late
interposed
mistress
nutter
you
can
not
save
her
and
remember
she
stands
in
your
place
or
you
or
she
must
be
devoted
i
will
never
desert
her
cried
alizon
twining
her
arms
round
her
dorothy
dear
dorothy
address
yourself
to
heaven
an
angry
growl
of
thunder
was
heard
beware
cried
mistress
nutter
i
am
not
to
be
discouraged
rejoined
alizon
firmly
you
can
not
gain
a
victory
over
a
soul
in
this
condition
and
i
shall
effect
her
deliverance
heaven
will
aid
us
dorothy
a
louder
roll
of
thunder
was
heard
followed
by
a
forked
flash
of
lightning
provoke
not
the
vengeance
of
the
prince
of
darkness
said
mistress
nutter
i
have
no
fear
replied
alizon
cling
to
me
dorothy
no
harm
shall
befall
you
be
speedy
cried
the
voice
let
her
go
cried
mistress
nutter
to
alizon
or
you
will
rue
this
disobedience
why
should
you
interfere
with
my
projects
and
bring
ruin
on
yourself
i
would
save
you
what
still
obstinate
nay
then
i
will
no
longer
show
forbearance
help
me
sisters
force
the
new
witch
from
her
but
beware
how
you
harm
my
child
at
these
words
the
troop
gathered
round
the
two
girls
but
alizon
only
clasped
her
hands
more
tightly
round
dorothy
while
the
latter
on
whose
brain
the
maddening
potion
still
worked
laughed
frantically
at
them
it
was
at
this
moment
that
elizabeth
device
who
had
conceived
a
project
of
revenge
put
it
into
execution
while
near
dorothy
she
stamped
spat
on
the
ground
and
then
cast
a
little
mould
over
her
breathing
in
her
ear
thou
art
bewitched
bewitched
by
alizon
device
dorothy
instantly
struggled
to
free
herself
from
alizon
oh
do
not
you
strive
against
me
dear
dorothy
cried
alizon
remain
with
me
or
you
are
lost
hence
off
set
me
free
shrieked
dorothy
you
have
bewitched
me
i
heard
it
this
moment
do
not
believe
the
false
suggestion
cried
alizon
it
is
true
exclaimed
all
the
other
witches
together
alizon
has
bewitched
you
and
will
kill
you
shake
her
off
shake
her
off
away
cried
dorothy
mustering
all
her
force
away
but
alizon
was
still
too
strong
for
her
and
in
spite
of
her
efforts
at
liberation
detained
her
my
patience
is
wellnigh
exhausted
exclaimed
the
voice
alizon
cried
mistress
nutter
imploringly
and
again
the
witches
gathered
furiously
round
the
two
girls
kneel
dorothy
kneel
whispered
alizon
and
forcing
her
down
she
fell
on
her
knees
beside
her
exclaiming
with
uplifted
hands
gracious
heaven
deliver
us
as
the
words
were
uttered
a
fearful
cry
was
heard
and
the
weird
troop
fled
away
screaming
like
birds
the
caldron
sank
into
the
ground
the
dense
mist
arose
like
a
curtain
and
the
moon
and
stars
shone
brightly
down
upon
the
ruined
pile
alizon
prayed
long
and
fervently
with
clasped
hands
and
closed
eyes
for
deliverance
from
evil
when
she
looked
round
again
all
was
so
calm
so
beautiful
so
holy
in
its
rest
that
she
could
scarcely
believe
in
the
recent
fearful
occurrences
her
hair
and
garments
were
damp
with
the
dews
of
night
and
at
her
feet
lay
dorothy
insensible
she
tried
to
raise
her
to
revive
her
but
in
vain
when
at
this
moment
footsteps
were
heard
approaching
and
the
next
moment
mistress
nutter
accompanied
by
adam
whitworth
and
some
other
entered
the
choir
i
see
them
they
are
here
cried
the
lady
rushing
forward
heaven
be
praised
you
have
found
them
madam
exclaimed
the
old
steward
coming
quickly
after
her
oh
what
an
alarm
you
have
given
me
alizon
said
mistress
nutter
what
could
induce
you
to
go
forth
secretly
at
night
in
this
way
with
dorothy
i
dreamed
you
were
here
and
missing
you
when
i
awoke
roused
the
house
and
came
in
search
of
you
what
is
the
matter
with
dorothy
she
has
been
frightened
i
suppose
i
will
give
her
to
breathe
at
this
phial
it
will
revive
her
see
she
opens
her
eyes
dorothy
looked
round
wildly
for
a
moment
and
then
pointing
her
finger
at
alizon
said
she
has
bewitched
me
poor
thing
she
rambles
observed
mistress
nutter
to
adam
whitworth
who
with
the
other
stared
aghast
at
the
accusation
she
has
been
scared
out
of
her
senses
by
some
fearful
sight
let
her
be
conveyed
quickly
to
my
chamber
and
i
will
see
her
cared
for
the
orders
were
obeyed
dorothy
was
raised
gently
by
the
but
she
still
kept
pointing
to
alizon
and
repeatedly
exclaimed
she
has
bewitched
me
the
shook
their
heads
and
looked
significantly
at
each
other
while
mistress
nutter
lingered
to
speak
to
her
daughter
you
look
greatly
disturbed
alizon
as
if
you
had
been
visited
by
a
nightmare
in
your
sleep
and
were
still
under
its
influence
alizon
made
no
reply
a
few
hours
tranquil
sleep
will
restore
you
pursued
mistress
nutter
and
you
will
forget
your
fears
you
must
not
indulge
in
these
nocturnal
rambles
again
or
they
may
be
attended
with
dangerous
consequences
i
may
not
have
a
second
warning
dream
come
to
the
house
and
as
alizon
followed
her
along
the
garden
path
she
could
not
help
asking
herself
though
with
little
hope
in
the
question
if
all
she
had
witnessed
was
indeed
nothing
more
than
a
troubled
dream

flint
a
lovely
morning
succeeded
the
strange
and
terrible
night
brightly
shone
the
sun
upon
the
fair
calder
as
it
winded
along
the
green
meads
above
the
bridge
as
it
rushed
rejoicingly
over
the
weir
and
pursued
its
rapid
course
through
the
broad
plain
below
the
abbey
a
few
white
vapours
hung
upon
the
summit
of
whalley
nab
but
the
warm
rays
tinging
them
with
gold
and
tipping
with
fire
the
that
pierced
through
them
augured
their
speedy
dispersion
so
beautiful
so
tranquil
looked
the
old
monastic
fane
that
none
would
have
deemed
its
midnight
rest
had
been
broken
by
the
impious
rites
of
a
foul
troop
the
choir
where
the
unearthly
scream
and
the
demon
laughter
had
resounded
was
now
vocal
with
the
melodies
of
the
blackbird
the
thrush
and
other
songsters
of
the
grove
bells
of
dew
glittered
upon
the
bushes
rooted
in
the
walls
and
upon
the
pillars
and
gemming
the
countless
spiders
webs
stretched
from
bough
to
bough
showed
they
were
all
unbroken
no
traces
were
visible
on
the
sod
where
the
unhallowed
crew
had
danced
their
round
nor
were
any
ashes
left
where
the
fire
had
burnt
and
the
caldron
had
bubbled
the
tombs
of
the
abbots
in
the
presbytery
looked
as
if
a
century
had
passed
over
them
without
disturbance
while
the
graves
in
the
cloister
cemetery
obliterated
and
only
to
be
detected
when
a
broken
coffin
or
a
mouldering
bone
was
turned
up
by
the
tiller
of
the
ground
preserved
their
wonted
appearance
the
face
of
nature
had
received
neither
impress
nor
injury
from
the
fantastic
freaks
and
necromantic
exhibitions
of
the
witches
every
thing
looked
as
it
was
left
overnight
and
the
only
footprints
to
be
detected
were
those
of
the
two
girls
and
of
the
party
who
came
in
quest
of
them
all
else
had
passed
by
like
a
vision
or
a
dream
the
rooks
cawed
loudly
in
the
neighbouring
trees
as
if
discussing
the
question
of
breakfast
and
the
jackdaws
wheeled
merrily
round
the
tall
spire
which
sprang
from
the
eastern
end
of
the
fane
brightly
shone
the
sun
upon
the
noble
timber
embowering
the
mansion
of
the
asshetons
upon
the
ancient
gateway
in
the
upper
chamber
of
which
ned
huddlestone
the
porter
and
the
burly
representative
of
friar
tuck
was
rubbing
his
sleepy
eyes
preparatory
to
habiting
himself
in
his
ordinary
attire
and
upon
the
wide
across
which
nicholas
was
walking
in
the
direction
of
the
stables
notwithstanding
his
excesses
overnight
the
squire
was
astir
as
he
had
declared
he
should
be
before
daybreak
and
a
plunge
into
the
calder
had
cooled
his
feverish
limbs
and
cured
his
racking
headache
while
a
draught
of
ale
set
his
stomach
right
still
in
modern
parlance
he
looked
rather
seedy
and
his
recollection
of
the
events
of
the
previous
night
was
somewhat
confused
aware
he
had
committed
many
fooleries
he
did
not
desire
to
investigate
matters
too
closely
and
only
hoped
he
should
not
be
reminded
of
them
by
sir
ralph
or
worse
still
by
parson
dewhurst
as
to
his
poor
dear
uncomplaining
wife
he
never
once
troubled
his
head
about
her
feeling
quite
sure
she
would
not
upbraid
him
on
his
appearance
in
the
the
two
noble
and
several
lesser
dogs
came
forward
to
greet
him
and
attended
by
this
noisy
pack
he
marched
up
to
a
groom
who
was
rubbing
down
his
horse
at
the
poor
robin
he
cried
to
the
steed
who
neighed
at
his
approach
poor
robin
he
said
patting
his
neck
affectionately
there
is
not
thy
match
for
speed
or
endurance
for
fence
or
ditch
for
beck
or
stone
wall
in
the
country
half
an
hour
on
thy
back
will
make
all
right
with
me
but
i
would
rather
take
thee
to
bowland
forest
and
hunt
the
stag
there
than
go
and
perambulate
the
boundaries
of
the
rough
lee
estates
with
a
rascally
attorney
i
wonder
how
the
fellow
will
be
mounted
if
yo
be
speering
about
mester

the
groom
ey

exclaimed

laughing
he

able
to
manage
him

the
wickedest
and
most
wilful
little
brute
i
ever
knew
we

have

if

you
think
nothing
of
the

peter
said
nicholas
you
expect
to
see
the
little
gentleman
fly
over
the
pony
head
and
perhaps
break
his
own
at
starting
but
if
sir
ralph
has
ordered
it
he
must
abide
by
the
consequences
i
interfere
further
how
goes
on
the
young
colt
you
were
breaking
in
you
should
take
care
to
show
him
the
saddle
in
the
manger
let
him
smell
it
and
jingle
the
stirrups
in
his
ears
before
you
put
it
on
his
back
better
ground
for
his
first
lessons
could
not
be
desired
than
the
field
below
the
grange
near
the
calder
sir
ralph
was
saying
yesterday
that
the
roan
mare
had
pricked
her
foot
you
must
wash
the
sore
well
with
white
wine
and
salt
rub
it
with
the
ointment
the
farriers
call
ægyptiacum
and
then
put
upon
it
a
hot
plaster
compounded
of
flax
hards
turpentine
oil
and
wax
bathing
the
top
of
the
hoof
with
bole
armeniac
and
vinegar
this
is
the
best
and
quickest
remedy
and
recollect
peter
that
for
a
new
strain
vinegar
bole
armeniac
whites
of
eggs
and
make
the
best
salve
how
goes
on
sir
black
charger
dragon
a
brave
horse
that
peter
and
the
only
one
in
your
master
whole
stud
to
compare
with
my
robin
but
dragon
though
of
high
courage
and
great
swiftness
has
not
the
strength
and
endurance
of
robin
neither
can
he
leap
so
well
why
robin
would
almost
clear
the
calder
peter
and
makes
nothing
of
smithies
brook
near
downham
and
you
know
how
wide
that
stream
is
i
once
tried
him
at
the
ribble
at
a
narrow
point
and
if
horse
could
have
done
it
he
would
but
it
was
too
much
to
expect
a
great
deal
ey
should
say
squoire
replied
the
groom
opening
his
eyes
to
their
widest
extent
whoy
th
ribble
where
yo
speak
on
mun
be
twenty
yards
across
if
it
be
an
inch
and
no
nag
os
ever
wur
bred
could
clear
that
onless
a
witch
wur
on
his
back
do
allude
to
witches
peter
said
nicholas
i
had
enough
of
them
but
to
come
back
to
our
steeds
colour
is
matter
of
taste
and
a
man
must
please
his
own
eye
with
bay
or
grey
chestnut
sorrel
or
black
but
dun
is
my
fancy
a
good
horse
peter
should
be
with
wide
nostrils
a
horse
with
half
these
points
would
not
be
wrong
and
robin
has
them
all
so
he
has
sure
enough
squoire
replied
peter
regarding
the
animal
with
an
approving
eye
as
nicholas
enumerated
his
merits

the

rejoined
nicholas
shrugging

the
groom

peter
that
the
way
to
test
their
respective
merit
returned
nicholas
and
they
wo
remain
long
together
i
warrant
you
i
offered
to
make
a
match
for
twenty
pieces
with
master
richard
but
he
declined
the
offer
harkee
peter
break
an
egg
in
robin
mouth
before
you
put
on
his
bridle
it
strengthens
the
wind
and
adds
to
a
horse
power
of
endurance
you

replied
the
groom
by
th

that

nicholas

said
peter
and
he
added
to
himself
as
nicholas
moved

tum

gies
an

to
merlin
an
may
aw
fair
if
they
chance
to
try
their
osses
mettle
as
nicholas
returned
to
the
house
he
perceived
to
his
dismay
sir
ralph
and
parson
dewhurst
standing
upon
the
steps
and
convinced
from
their
grave
looks
that
they
were
prepared
to
lecture
him
he
endeavoured
to
nerve
himself
for
the
infliction
two
to
one
are
awkward
odds
said
the
squire
to
himself
especially
when
they
have
the
ground
but
i
must
face
them
and
make
the
best
fight
circumstances
will
allow
i
shall
never
be
able
to
explain
that
mad
dance
with
isole
de
heton
no
one
but
dick
will
believe
me
and
the
chances
are
he
will
not
support
my
story
but
i
must
put
on
an
air
of
penitence
and
sooth
to
say
in
my
present
state
it
is
not
very
difficult
to
assume
thus
pondering
with
slow
step
affectedly
humble
demeanour
and
visage
he
approached
the
pair
who
were
waiting
for
him
and
regarding
him
with
severe
looks
thinking
it
the
best
plan
to
open
the
fire
himself
nicholas
saluted
them
and
said
give
you
sir
ralph
and
you
too
worthy
master
dewhurst
i
scarcely
expected
to
see
you
so
early
astir
good
sirs
but
the
morning
is
too
beautiful
to
allow
us
to
be
sluggards
for
my
own
part
i
have
been
awake
for
hours
and
have
passed
the
time
wholly
in
for
my
folly
and
sinfulness
last
night
as
well
as
in
forming
resolutions
for
and
better
governance
in
future
i
hope
you
will
adhere
to
those
resolutions
then
nicholas
rejoined
sir
ralph
sternly
for
change
of
conduct
is
absolutely
necessary
if
you
would
maintain
your
character
as
a
gentleman
i
can
make
allowance
for
high
animal
spirits
and
can
excuse
some
licence
though
i
do
not
approve
of
it
but
i
will
not
permit
decorum
to
be
outraged
in
my
house
and
suffer
so
ill
an
example
to
be
set
to
my
tenantry
fortunately
i
was
not
present
at
the
exhibition
said
dewhurst
but
i
am
told
you
conducted
yourself
like
one
possessed
and
committed
such
freaks
as
are
rarely
if
ever
acted
by
a
rational
being
i
can
offer
no
defence
worthy
sir
and
you
my
respected
relative
returned
nicholas
with
a
contrite
air
neither
can
you
reprove
me
more
strongly
than
i
deserve
nor
than
i
upbraid
myself
i
allowed
myself
to
be
overcome
by
wine
and
in
that
condition
was
undoubtedly
guilty
of
follies
i
must
ever
regret
amongst
others
i
believe
you
stood
upon
your
head
remarked
dewhurst
i
am
not
aware
of
the
circumstance
reverend
sir
replied
nicholas
with
difficulty
repressing
a
smile
but
as
i
certainly
lost
my
head
i
may
have
stood
upon
it
unconsciously
but
i
do
recollect
enough
to
make
me
heartily
ashamed
of
myself
and
determine
to
avoid
all
such
excesses
in
future
in
that
case
sir
rejoined
dewhurst
the
occurrences
of
last
night
though
sufficiently
discreditable
to
you
will
not
be
without
profit
for
i
have
observed
to
my
infinite
regret
that
you
are
apt
to
indulge
in
immoderate
potations
and
when
under
their
influence
to
lose
due
command
of
yourself
and
commit
follies
which
your
sober
reason
must
condemn
at
such
times
i
scarcely
recognise
you
you
speak
with
unbecoming
levity
and
even
allow
oaths
to
escape
your
lips
it
is
too
true
reverend
sir
said
nicholas
but
zounds
a
plague
upon
my
tongue
it
is
an
unruly
member
forgive
me
good
sir
but
my
brain
is
a
little
confused
i
do
not
wonder
from
the
grievous
assaults
made
upon
it
last
night
nicholas
observed
sir
ralph
perhaps
you
are
not
aware
that
your
crowning
act
was
whisking
wildly
round
the
room
by
yourself
like
a
frantic
dervish
i
was
dancing
with
isole
de
heton
said
nicholas
with
whom
inquired
dewhurst
in
surprise
with
a
wicked
votaress
who
has
been
dead
nearly
a
couple
of
centuries
interposed
sir
ralph
and
who
by
her
sinful
life
merited
the
punishment
she
is
said
to
have
incurred
this
delusion
shows
how
dreadfully
intoxicated
you
were
nicholas
for
the
time
you
had
quite
lost
your
reason
i
am
sober
enough
now
at
all
events
rejoined
nicholas
and
i
am
convinced
that
isole
did
dance
with
me
nor
will
any
arguments
reason
me
out
of
that
belief
i
am
sorry
to
hear
you
say
so
nicholas
returned
sir
ralph
that
you
were
under
the
impression
at
the
time
i
can
easily
understand
but
that
you
should
persist
in
such
a
senseless
and
wicked
notion
is
more
than
i
can
comprehend
i
saw
her
with
my
own
eyes
as
plainly
as
i
see
you
sir
ralph
replied
nicholas
warmly
that
i
declare
upon
my
honour
and
conscience
and
i
also
felt
the
pressure
of
her
arms
whether
it
may
not
have
been
the
fiend
in
her
likeness
i
will
not
take
upon
me
to
declare
and
indeed
i
have
some
misgivings
on
the
subject
but
that
a
beautiful
creature
exactly
resembling
the
votaress
danced
with
me
i
will
ever
maintain
if
so
she
was
invisible
to
others
for
i
beheld
her
not
said
sir
ralph
and
though
i
can
not
yield
credence
to
your
explanation
yet
granting
it
to
be
correct
i
do
not
see
how
it
mends
your
case
on
the
contrary
it
only
proves
that
master
nicholas
yielded
to
the
snares
of
satan
said
dewhurst
shaking
his
head
i
would
recommend
you
long
fasting
and
frequent
prayer
my
good
sir
and
i
shall
prepare
a
lecture
for
your
special
edification
which
i
will
propound
to
you
on
your
return
to
downham
and
if
it
fails
in
effect
i
will
persevere
with
other
godly
discourses
with
your
aid
i
trust
to
be
set
free
reverend
sir
returned
nicholas
but
as
i
have
already
passed
two
or
three
hours
in
prayer
i
hope
they
may
stand
me
in
lieu
of
any
present
fasting
and
induce
you
to
omit
the
article
of
penance
or
postpone
it
to
some
future
occasion
when
i
may
be
better
able
to
perform
it
for
i
am
just
now
particularly
hungry
and
am
always
better
able
to
resist
temptation
with
a
full
stomach
than
an
empty
one
as
i
find
it
displeasing
to
sir
ralph
i
will
not
insist
upon
my
visionary
partner
in
the
dance
at
least
until
i
am
better
able
to
substantiate
the
fact
and
i
shall
listen
to
your
lectures
worthy
sir
with
great
delight
and
i
doubt
not
with
equal
benefit
but
in
the
meantime
as
carnal
wants
must
be
supplied
and
mundane
matters
attended
to
i
propose
with
our
excellent
permission
that
we
proceed
to
breakfast
sir
ralph
made
no
answer
but
ascended
the
steps
and
was
followed
by
dewhurst
heaving
a
deep
sigh
and
turning
up
the
whites
of
his
eyes
and
by
nicholas
who
felt
his
bosom
eased
of
half
its
load
and
secretly
congratulated
himself
upon
getting
out
of
the
scrape
so
easily
in
the
hall
they
found
richard
assheton
habited
in
a
booted
spurred
and
in
all
respects
prepared
for
the
expedition
there
were
such
evident
traces
of
anxiety
and
suffering
about
him
that
sir
ralph
questioned
him
as
to
the
cause
and
richard
replied
that
he
had
passed
a
most
restless
night
he
did
not
add
that
he
had
been
made
acquainted
by
adam
whitworth
with
the
midnight
visit
of
the
two
girls
to
the
conventual
church
because
he
was
well
aware
sir
ralph
would
be
greatly
displeased
by
the
circumstance
and
because
mistress
nutter
had
expressed
a
wish
that
it
should
be
kept
secret
sir
ralph
however
saw
there
was
more
upon
his
young
relative
mind
than
he
chose
to
confess
but
he
did
not
urge
any
further
admission
into
his
confidence
meantime
the
party
had
been
increased
by
the
arrival
of
master
potts
who
was
likewise
equipped
for
the
ride
the
hour
was
too
early
it
might
be
for
him
or
he
had
not
rested
well
like
richard
or
had
been
troubled
with
bad
dreams
but
certainly
he
did
not
look
very
well
or
in
very
he
had
slept
at
the
abbey
having
been
accommodated
with
a
bed
after
the
sudden
seizure
which
he
attributed
to
the
instrumentality
of
mistress
nutter
the
little
attorney
bowed
obsequiously
to
sir
ralph
who
returned
his
salutation
very
stiffly
nor
was
he
much
better
received
by
the
rest
of
the
company
at
a
sign
from
sir
ralph
his
guests
then
knelt
down
and
a
prayer
was
uttered
by
the
divine
or
rather
a
discourse
for
it
partook
more
of
the
latter
character
than
the
former
in
the
course
of
it
he
took
occasion
to
paint
in
strong
colours
the
terrible
consequences
of
intemperance
and
nicholas
was
obliged
to
endure
a
lecture
of
half
an
hour
duration
but
even
parson
dewhurst
could
not
hold
out
for
ever
and
to
the
relief
of
all
his
hearers
he
at
length
brought
this
discourse
to
a
close
breakfast
at
this
period
was
a
much
more
substantial
affair
than
a
modern
morning
repast
and
differed
little
from
dinner
or
supper
except
in
respect
to
quantity
on
the
present
occasion
there
were
carbonadoes
of
fish
and
fowl
a
cold
chine
a
huge
pasty
a
capon
neat
tongues
sausages
botargos
and
other
matters
as
provocative
of
thirst
as
sufficing
to
the
appetite
nicholas
set
to
work
bravely
broiled
trout
steaks
and
a
huge
slice
of
venison
pasty
disappeared
quickly
before
him
and
he
was
not
quite
so
sparing
of
the
ale
as
seemed
consistent
with
his
resolutions
of
temperance
in
vain
parson
dewhurst
filled
a
goblet
with
water
and
looked
significantly
at
him
he
would
not
take
the
hint
and
turned
a
deaf
ear
to
the
admonitory
cough
of
sir
ralph
he
had
little
help
from
the
others
for
richard
ate
sparingly
and
master
potts
made
a
very
poor
figure
beside
him
at
length
having
cleared
his
plate
emptied
his
cup
and
wiped
his
lips
the
squire
arose
and
said
he
must
bid
adieu
to
his
wife
and
should
then
be
ready
to
attend
them
while
he
quitted
the
hall
for
this
purpose
mistress
nutter
entered
it
she
looked
paler
than
ever
and
her
eyes
seemed
larger
darker
and
brighter
nicholas
shuddered
slightly
as
she
approached
and
even
potts
felt
a
thrill
of
apprehension
pass
through
his
frame
he
scarcely
indeed
ventured
a
look
at
her
for
he
dreaded
her
mysterious
power
and
feared
she
could
fathom
the
designs
he
secretly
entertained
against
her
but
she
took
no
notice
whatever
of
him
acknowledging
sir
salutation
she
motioned
richard
to
follow
her
to
the
further
end
of
the
room
your
sister
is
very
ill
richard
she
said
as
the
young
man
attended
her
feverish
and
almost
adam
whitworth
has
told
you
i
know
that
she
was
imprudent
enough
in
company
with
alizon
to
visit
the
ruins
of
the
conventual
church
late
last
night
and
she
there
sustained
some
fright
which
has
produced
a
great
shock
upon
her
system
when
found
she
was
fainting
and
though
i
have
taken
every
care
of
her
she
still
continues
much
excited
and
rambles
strangely
you
will
be
surprised
as
well
as
grieved
when
i
tell
you
that
she
charges
alizon
with
having
bewitched
her
how
madam
cried
richard
alizon
bewitch
her
it
is
impossible
you
are
right
richard
replied
mistress
nutter
the
thing
is
impossible
but
the
accusation
will
find
easy
credence
among
the
superstitious
household
here
and
may
be
highly
prejudicial
if
not
fatal
to
poor
alizon
it
is
most
unlucky
she
should
have
gone
out
in
this
way
for
the
circumstance
can
not
be
explained
and
in
itself
serves
to
throw
suspicion
upon
her
i
must
see
dorothy
before
i
go
said
richard
perhaps
i
may
be
able
to
soothe
her
it
was
for
that
end
i
came
hither
replied
mistress
nutter
but
i
thought
it
well
you
should
be
prepared
now
come
with
me
upon
this
they
left
the
hall
together
and
proceeded
to
the
chamber
where
dorothy
was
lodged
richard
was
greatly
shocked
at
the
sight
of
his
sister
so
utterly
changed
was
she
from
the
blithe
being
of
yesterday
then
so
full
of
health
and
happiness
her
cheeks
burnt
with
fever
her
eyes
were
unnaturally
bright
and
her
fair
hair
hung
about
her
face
in
disorder
she
kept
fast
hold
of
alizon
who
stood
beside
her
ah
richard
she
cried
on
seeing
him
i
am
glad
you
are
come
you
will
persuade
this
girl
to
restore
me
to
reason
to
free
me
from
the
terrors
that
beset
me
she
can
do
so
if
she
will
calm
yourself
dear
sister
said
richard
gently
endeavouring
to
free
alizon
from
her
grasp
no
do
not
take
her
from
me
said
dorothy
wildly
i
am
better
when
she
is
near
me
much
better
my
brow
does
not
throb
so
violently
and
my
limbs
are
not
twisted
so
painfully
do
you
know
what
ails
me
richard
you
have
caught
cold
from
wandering
out
indiscreetly
last
night
said
richard
i
am
bewitched
rejoined
dorothy
in
tones
that
pierced
her
brain
bewitched
by
alizon
device
by
your
love
ha
ha
she
wishes
to
kill
me
richard
because
she
thinks
i
am
in
her
way
but
you
will
not
let
her
do
it
you
are
mistaken
dear
dorothy
she
means
you
no
harm
said
richard
heaven
knows
how
much
i
grieve
for
her
and
how
fondly
i
love
her
exclaimed
alizon
tearfully
it
is
false
cried
dorothy
she
will
tell
a
different
tale
when
you
are
gone
she
is
a
witch
and
you
shall
never
marry
her
richard
never
never
mistress
nutter
who
stood
at
a
little
distance
anxiously
observing
what
was
passing
waved
her
hand
several
times
towards
the
sufferer
but
without
effect
i
have
no
influence
over
her
she
muttered
she
is
really
bewitched
i
must
find
other
means
to
quieten
her
though
both
greatly
distressed
alizon
and
richard
redoubled
their
attentions
to
the
poor
sufferer
for
a
few
moments
she
remained
quiet
but
with
her
eyes
constantly
fixed
on
alizon
and
then
said
quickly
and
fiercely
i
have
been
told
if
you
scratch
one
who
has
bewitched
you
till
you
draw
blood
you
will
be
cured
i
will
plunge
my
nails
in
her
flesh
i
will
not
oppose
you
replied
alizon
gently
tear
my
flesh
if
you
will
you
should
have
my
life
blood
if
it
would
cure
you
but
if
the
success
of
the
experiment
depends
on
my
having
bewitched
you
it
will
assuredly
fail
this
is
dreadful
interposed
richard
leave
her
alizon
i
entreat
of
you
she
will
do
you
an
injury
i
care
not
replied
the
young
maid
i
will
stay
by
her
till
she
voluntarily
releases
me
the
almost
tigress
fury
with
which
dorothy
had
seized
upon
the
unresisting
girl
here
suddenly
deserted
her
and
sobbing
hysterically
she
fell
upon
her
neck
oh
with
what
delight
alizon
pressed
her
to
her
bosom
dorothy
dear
dorothy
she
cried
alizon
dear
alizon
responded
dorothy
oh
how
could
i
suspect
you
of
any
ill
design
against
me
she
is
no
witch
dear
sister
be
assured
of
that
said
richard
oh
no
no
no
i
am
quite
sure
she
is
not
cried
dorothy
kissing
her
affectionately
this
change
had
been
wrought
by
the
spells
of
mistress
nutter
the
access
is
over
she
mentally
ejaculated
but
i
must
get
him
away
before
the
fit
returns
you
had
better
go
now
richard
she
added
aloud
and
touching
his
arm
i
will
answer
for
your
restoration
an
opiate
will
produce
sleep
and
if
possible
she
shall
return
to
middleton
if
i
go
alizon
must
go
with
me
said
dorothy
well
well
i
will
not
thwart
your
desires
rejoined
mistress
nutter
and
she
made
a
sign
to
richard
to
depart
the
young
man
pressed
his
sister
hand
bade
a
tender
farewell
to
alizon
and
infinitely
relieved
by
the
improvement
which
had
taken
place
in
the
former
and
which
he
firmly
believed
would
speedily
lead
to
her
entire
restoration
descended
to
the
where
he
found
sir
ralph
and
parson
dewhurst
who
told
him
that
nicholas
and
potts
were
in
the
and
impatient
to
set
out
shouts
of
laughter
saluted
the
ears
of
the
trio
as
they
descended
the
steps
the
cause
of
the
merriment
was
speedily
explained
when
they
looked
towards
the
stables
and
beheld
potts
struggling
for
mastery
with
a
stout
welsh
pony
who
showed
every
disposition
by
plunging
kicking
and
rearing
to
remove
him
from
his
seat
though
without
success
for
the
attorney
was
not
quite
such
a
contemptible
horseman
as
might
be
imagined
a
little
fellow
was
flint
with
a
rough
coat
a
thick
tail
that
swept
the
ground
a
mane
to
match
and
an
eye
of
mixed
fire
and
cunning
when
brought
forth
he
had
allowed
potts
to
mount
him
quietly
enough
but
no
sooner
was
the
attorney
comfortably
in
possession
than
he
was
served
with
a
notice
of
ejectment
down
went
flint
head
and
up
went
his
heels
while
on
the
next
instant
he
was
rearing
aloft
with
his
beating
the
air
so
nearly
perpendicular
that
the
chances
seemed
in
favour
of
his
coming
down
on
his
back
then
he
whirled
suddenly
round
shook
himself
violently
threatened
to
roll
over
and
performed
antics
of
the
most
extraordinary
kind
to
the
dismay
of
his
rider
but
to
the
infinite
amusement
of
the
spectators
who
were
ready
to
split
their
sides
with
laughter
indeed
tears
fairly
streamed
down
the
squire
cheeks
however
when
sir
ralph
appeared
it
was
thought
desirable
to
put
an
end
to
the
fun
and
peter
the
groom
advanced
to
seize
the
restive
little
animal
bridle
but
eluding
the
grasp
flint
started
off
at
full
gallop
and
accompanied
by
the
two
careered
round
the
as
if
running
in
a
ring
vainly
did
poor
potts
tug
at
the
bridle
flint
having
the
bit
firmly
between
his
teeth
defied
his
utmost
efforts
away
he
went
with
the
hounds
at
his
heels
as
if
said
nicholas
the
devil
were
behind
him
though
annoyed
and
angry
sir
ralph
could
not
help
laughing
at
the
ridiculous
scene
and
even
a
smile
crossed
parson
dewhurst
grave
countenance
as
flint
and
his
rider
scampered
madly
past
them
sir
ralph
called
to
the
grooms
and
attempts
were
instantly
made
to
check
the
furious
pony
career
but
he
baffled
them
all
swerving
suddenly
round
when
an
endeavour
was
made
to
intercept
him
leaping
over
any
trifling
obstacle
and
occasionally
charging
any
one
who
stood
in
his
path
what
with
the
grooms
running
hither
and
thither
vociferating
and
swearing
the
barking
and
springing
of
the
hounds
the
yelping
of
lesser
dogs
and
the
screaming
of
poultry
the
whole
yard
was
in
a
state
of
uproar
and
confusion
flint
mun

possessed
cried
peter
ey
never

him

i
this
way

squoire
he
added
to
nicholas
the
devil
only
knows
replied
the
latter
but
it
seems
we
must
wait
till
the
little
rascal
chooses
to
stop
this
occurred
sooner
than
was
expected
thinking
possibly
that
he
had
done
enough
to
induce
master
potts
to
give
up
all
idea
of
riding
him
flint
suddenly
slackened
his
pace
and
trotted
as
if
nothing
had
happened
to
the
but
if
he
had
formed
any
such
notion
as
the
above
he
was
deceived
for
the
attorney
who
was
quite
as
obstinate
and
wilful
as
himself
and
who
through
all
his
perils
had
managed
to
maintain
his
seat
was
resolved
not
to
abandon
it
and
positively
refused
to
dismount
when
urged
to
do
so
by
nicholas
and
the
grooms
he
will
go
quietly
enough
now
i
dare
say
observed
potts
and
if
not
and
you
will
lend
me
a
i
will
undertake
to
cure
him
of
his
tricks
flint
seemed
to
understand
what
was
said
for
he
laid
back
his
ears
as
if
meditating
more
mischief
but
being
surrounded
by
the
grooms
he
deemed
it
advisable
to
postpone
the
attempt
to
a
more
convenient
opportunity
in
compliance
with
his
request
a
heavy
was
handed
to
potts
and
armed
with
this
formidable
weapon
the
little
attorney
quite
longed
for
an
opportunity
of
effacing
his
disgrace
meanwhile
sir
ralph
had
come
up
and
ordered
a
steady
horse
out
for
him
but
master
potts
adhered
to
his
resolution
and
flint
remaining
perfectly
quiet
the
baronet
let
him
have
his
own
way
soon
after
this
nicholas
and
richard
having
mounted
their
steeds
the
party
set
forth
as
they
were
passing
through
the
gateway
which
had
been
thrown
wide
open
by
ned
huddlestone
they
were
joined
by
simon
sparshot
who
had
been
engaged
by
potts
to
attend
him
on
the
expedition
in
his
capacity
of
constable
simon
was
mounted
on
a
mule
and
brought
word
that
master
roger
nowell
begged
they
would
ride
round
by

where
he
would
be
ready
to
accompany
them
as
he
wished
to
be
present
at
the
perambulation
of
the
boundaries
assenting
to
the
arrangement

whalley
led
up
the
side
of
a
hill
which
broken
into
picturesque
inequalities
and
partially
clothed
with
trees
sloped
down
to
the
very
brink
of
the
calder
winding
round
the
broad
green
plain
heretofore
described
with
the
lovely
knoll
in
the
midst
of
it
and
which
formed
with
the
woody
hills
encircling
it
a
perfect
amphitheatre
the
river
was
ever
an
object
of
beauty
sometimes
lost
beneath
boughs
or
high
banks
anon
bursting
forth
where
least
expected
now
rushing
swiftly
over
its
shallow
and
rocky
bed
now
subsiding
into
a
smooth
full
current
the
abbey
and
the
village
were
screened
from
view
by
the
lower
part
of
the
hill
which
the
horsemen
were
scaling
but
the
old
bridge
and
a
few
cottages
at
the
foot
of
whalley
nab
with
their
thin
blue
smoke
mounting
into
the
pure
morning
air
gave
life
and
interest
to
the
picture
hence
from
base
to
summit
whalley
nab
stood
revealed
and
the
verdant
lawns
opening
out
amidst
the
woods
feathering
its
heights
were
fully
discernible
placed
by
nature
as
the
guardian
of
this
fair
valley
the
lofty
eminence
well
became
the
post
assigned
to
it
none
of
the
belt
of
hills
connected
with
it
were
so
well
wooded
as
their
leader
nor
so
beautiful
in
form
while
some
of
them
were
overtopped
by
the
bleak
fells
of
longridge
rising
at
a
distance
behind
them
nor
were
those
exquisite
contrasts
wanting
which
are
only
to
be
seen
in
full
perfection
when
the
day
is
freshest
and
the
dew
is
still
heavy
on
the
grass
the
near
side
of
the
hill
was
plunged
in
deep
shade
thin
gauzy
vapour
hung
on
the
stream
beneath
while
on
the
opposite
heights
and
where
the
great
boulder
stones
were
visible
in
the
bed
of
the
river
all
was
sparkling
with
sunshine
so
enchanting
was
the
prospect
that
though
perfectly
familiar
with
it
the
two
foremost
horsemen
drew
in
the
rein
to
contemplate
it
high
above
them
on
a
sandbank
through
which
their
giant
roots
protruded
shot
up
two
tall
forming
with
their
newly
opened
foliage
a
canopy
of
tenderest
green
further
on
appeared
a
grove
of
oaks
scarcely
in
leaf
and
below
were
several
fine
sycamores
already
green
and
umbrageous
intermingled
with
elms
ashes
and
and
overshadowing
brakes
covered
with
maples
alders
and
hazels
the
other
spaces
among
the
trees
were
enlivened
by
patches
of
yellow
flowering
and
odorous
gorse
mixed
with
the
warblings
of
innumerable
feathered
songsters
were
heard
the
cheering
notes
of
the
cuckoo
and
the
swallows
were
seen
chasing
the
flies
along
the
plain
or
skimming
over
the
surface
of
the
river
already
had
richard
depression
yielded
to
the
exhilarating
freshness
of
the
morning
and
the
same
kindly
influence
produced
a
more
salutary
effect
on
nicholas
than
parson
lecture
had
been
able
to
accomplish
the
worthy
squire
was
a
true
lover
of
nature
admiring
her
in
all
her
forms
whether
arrayed
in
pomp
of
wood
and
verdure
as
in
the
lovely
landscape
before
him
or
dreary
and
desolate
as
in
the
heathy
forest
wastes
they
were
about
to
traverse
while
breathing
the
fresh
morning
air
inhaling
the
fragrance
of
the
and
listening
to
the
warbling
of
the
birds
he
took
a
survey
of
the
scene
commencing
with
the
bridge
passing
over
whalley
nab
and
the
mountainous
circle
conjoined
with
it
till
his
gaze
settled
on
morton
hall
a
noble
mansion
finely
situated
on
a
shoulder
of
the
hill
beyond
him
and
commanding
the
entire
valley
were
i
not
owner
of
downham
he
observed
to
richard
i
should
wish
to
be
master
of
morton
and
then
pointing
to
the
green
area
below
he
added
what
a
capital
spot
for
a
race
there
we
might
try
the
speed
of
our
nags
for
the
twenty
pieces
i
talked
of
yesterday
and
the
judges
of
the
match
and
those
who
chose
to
look
on
might
station
themselves
on
yon
knoll
which
seems
made
for
the
express
purpose
three
years
ago
i
remember
a
fair
was
held
upon
that
plain
and
the
the
wrestling
matches
and
the
various
sports
and
pastimes
of
the
rustics
viewed
from
the
knoll
formed
the
prettiest
sight
ever
looked
upon
but
pleasant
as
the
prospect
is
we
must
not
tarry
here
all
day
before
setting
forward
he
cast
a
glance
towards
pendle
hill
which
formed
the
most
prominent
object
of
view
on
the
left
and
lay
like
a
leviathan
basking
in
the
sunshine
the
vast
mass
rose
up
gradually
until
at
its
further
extremity
it
attained
an
altitude
of
more
than
feet
above
the
sea
at
the
present
moment
it
was
without
a
cloud
and
the
whole
of
its
broad
outline
was
distinctly
visible
i
love
pendle
hill
cried
nicholas
enthusiastically
and
from
whatever
side
i
view
it
whether
from
this
place
where
i
see
it
from
end
to
end
from
its
lowest
point
to
its
highest
from
padiham
where
it
frowns
upon
me
from
clithero
where
it
smiles
or
from
downham
where
it
rises
in
full
majesty
before
me
from
all
points
and
under
all
aspects
whether
robed
in
mist
or
radiant
with
sunshine
i
delight
in
it
born
beneath
its
giant
shadow
i
look
upon
it
with
filial
regard
some
folks
say
pendle
hill
wants
grandeur
and
sublimity
but
they
themselves
must
be
wanting
in
taste
its
broad
round
smooth
mass
is
better
than
the
roughest
craggiest
shaggiest
most
sharply
splintered
mountain
of
them
all
and
then
what
a
view
it
commands
lancaster
with
its
grey
old
castle
on
one
hand
york
with
its
reverend
minster
on
the
other
the
irish
sea
and
its
wild
coast
fell
forest
moor
and
valley
watered
by
the
ribble
the
hodder
the
calder
and
the
lime
rivers
not
to
be
matched
for
beauty
you
recollect
the
old
distich
pendle
hill
and
pennygent
are
the
highest
hills
between
scotland
and
trent
this
vouches
for
its
height
but
there
are
two
other
doggerel
lines
still
more
to
the
purpose
hill
pennygent
and
ingleborough
are
three
such
hills
as
you
not
find
by
seeking
england
thorough
with
this
opinion
i
quite
agree
there
is
no
hill
in
england
like
pendle
hill
every
man
to
his
taste
squire
observed
potts
but
to
my
mind
pendle
hill
has
no
other
recommendation
than
its
size
i
think
it
a
great
brown
ugly
lumpy
mass
without
beauty
of
form
or
any
striking
character
i
hate
your
bleak
lancashire
hills
with
heathy
ranges
on
the
top
fit
only
for
the
sustenance
of
a
few
poor
sheep
and
as
to
the
view
from
them
it
is
little
else
than
a
continuous
range
of
moors
and
dwarfed
forests
highgate
hill
is
quite
mountain
enough
for
me
and
hampstead
heath
wild
enough
for
any
civilised
purpose
a
veritable
son
of
cockayne
muttered
nicholas
contemptuously
riding
on
and
entering
the
grove
of
oaks
he
lost
sight
of
his
favourite
hill
though
glimpses
were
occasionally
caught
through
the
trees
of
the
lovely
valley
below
soon
afterwards
the
party
turned
off
on
the
left
and
presently
arrived
at
a
gate
which
admitted
them
to
read
park
five
minutes
canter
over
the
springy
turf
then
brought
them
to
the
house
the
manor

reved

into
the
possession
of
the
nowell
family
in
the
time
of
edward
and
extended
on
one
side
within
a
mile
of
whalley
from
which
township
it
was
divided
by
a
deep
woody
ravine
taking
its
name
from
the
little
village
of
sabden
and
on
the
other
stretched
far
into
pendle
forest
the
hall
was
situated
on
an
eminence
forming
part
of
the
heights
of
padiham
and
faced
a
wide
valley
watered
by
the
calder
and
consisting
chiefly
of
barren
tracts
of
moor
and
forest
land
bounded
by
the
high
hills
near
accrington
and
rossendale
on
the
left
some
miles
off
lay
burnley
and
the
greater
part
of
the
land
in
this
direction
being
uninclosed
and
thinly
peopled
had
a
dark
dreary
look
that
served
to
enhance
the
green
beauty
of
the
district
on
the
right
behind
the
mansion
thick
woods
extended
to
the
very
confines
of
pendle
forest
of
which
indeed
they
originally
formed
part
and
here
if
the
course
of
the
stream
flowing
through
the
gully
of
sabden
were
followed
every
variety
of
brake
glen
and
dingle
might
be
found
read
hall
was
a
large
and
commodious
mansion
forming
with
a
centre
and
two
advancing
wings
three
sides
of
a
square
between
which
was
a
ornamented
with
a
dial
the
gardens
were
laid
out
in
the
taste
of
the
time
with
trim
alleys
and
parterres
terraces
and
steps
stone
statues
and
clipped
yews
the
house
was
kept
up
well
and
consistently
by
its
owner
who
lived
like
a
country
gentleman
with
a
good
estate
entertained
his
friends
hospitably
but
without
any
parade
and
was
never
needlessly
lavish
in
his
expenditure
unless
perhaps
in
the
instance
of
the
large
ostentatious
pew
erected
by
him
in
the
parish
church
of
whalley
and
which
considering
he
had
a
private
chapel
at
home
and
maintained
a
domestic
chaplain
to
do
duty
in
it
seemed
little
required
and
drew
upon
him
the
censure
of
the
neighbouring
gossips
who
said
there
was
more
of
pride
than
religion
in
his
pew
with
the
chapel
at
the
hall
a
curious
history
was
afterwards
connected
converted
into
a
by
a
descendant
of
roger
nowell
the
apartment
was
incautiously
occupied
by
the
planner
of
the
alterations
before
the
plaster
was
thoroughly
dried
in
consequence
of
which
he
caught
a
severe
cold
and
died
in
the
desecrated
chamber
his
fate
being
looked
upon
as
a
judgment
with
many
good
qualities
roger
nowell
was
little
liked
his
austere
and
sarcastic
manner
repelled
his
equals
and
his
harshness
made
him
an
object
of
dislike
and
dread
among
his
inferiors
besides
being
the
terror
of
all
he
was
a
hard
man
in
his
dealings
though
he
endeavoured
to
be
just
and
persuaded
himself
he
was
so
a
year
or
two
before
having
been
appointed
sheriff
of
the
county
he
had
discharged
the
important
office
with
so
much
zeal
and
ability
as
well
as
liberality
that
he
rose
considerably
in
public
estimation
it
was
during
this
period
that
master
potts
came
under
his
notice
at
lancaster
and
the
little
attorney
shrewdness
gained
him
an
excellent
client
in
the
owner
of
read
roger
newell
was
a
widower
but
his
son
who
resided
with
him
was
married
and
had
a
family
so
that
the
hall
was
fully
occupied
roger
nowell
was
turned
sixty
but
he
was
still
in
the
full
vigour
of
mind
and
body
his
temperate
and
active
habits
keeping
him
healthy
he
was
of
a
spare
muscular
frame
somewhat
bent
in
the
shoulders
and
had
very
sharp
features
keen
grey
eyes
a
close
mouth
and
prominent
chin
his
hair
was
white
as
silver
but
his
eyebrows
were
still
black
and
bushy
seeing
the
party
approach
the
lord
of
the
mansion
came
forth
to
meet
them
and
begged
them
to
dismount
for
a
moment
and
refresh
themselves
richard
excused
himself
but
nicholas
sprang
from
his
saddle
and
potts
though
somewhat
more
slowly
imitated
his
example
an
open
door
admitted
them
to
the
entrance
hall
where
a
repast
was
spread
of
which
the
host
pressed
his
guests
to
partake
but
nicholas
declined
on
the
score
of
having
just
breakfasted
notwithstanding
which
he
was
easily
prevailed
upon
to
take
a
cup
of
ale
leaving
him
to
discuss
it
nowell
led
the
attorney
to
a
library
where
he
usually
transacted
his
magisterial
business
and
held
a
few
minutes
private
conference
with
him
after
which
they
returned
to
nicholas
and
by
this
time
the
magistrate
own
horse
being
brought
round
the
party
mounted
once
more
the
attorney
regretted
abandoning
his
seat
for
flint
indulged
him
with
another
exhibition
somewhat
similar
to
the
first
though
of
less
duration
for
a
vigorous
application
of
the
brought
the
little
animal
to
reason
elated
by
the
victory
he
had
obtained
over
flint
and
anticipating
a
successful
issue
to
the
expedition
master
potts
was
in
excellent
spirits
and
found
a
great
deal
to
admire
in
the
domain
of
his
honoured
and
singular
good
client
though
not
very
genuine
his
admiration
was
deservedly
bestowed
the
portion
of
the
park
they
were
now
traversing
was
extremely
diversified
and
beautiful
with
long
sweeping
lawns
studded
with
fine
trees
among
which
were
many
ancient
thorns
now
in
full
bloom
and
richly
scenting
the
gale
herds
of
deer
were
nipping
the
short
grass
browsing
the
lower
spray
of
the
ashes
or
couching
amid
the
ferny
hollows
it
was
now
that
nicholas
who
had
been
all
along
anxious
to
try
the
speed
of
his
horse
proposed
to
richard
a
gallop
towards
a
clump
of
trees
about
a
mile
off
and
the
young
man
assenting
away
they
started
master
potts
started
too
for
flint
did
not
like
to
be
left
behind
but
the
mettlesome
pony
was
soon
distanced
for
some
time
the
two
horses
kept
so
closely
together
that
it
was
difficult
to
say
which
would
arrive
at
the
goal
first
but
robin
got
though
at
first
indifferent
to
the
issue
of
the
race
the
spirit
of
emulation
soon
seized
upon
richard
and
spurring
merlin
the
noble
animal
sprang
forward
and
was
once
again
by
the
side
of
his
opponent
for
a
quarter
of
a
mile
the
ground
had
been
tolerably
level
and
the
sod
firm
but
they
now
approached
a
swamp
and
in
his
eagerness
nicholas
did
not
take
sufficient
precaution
and
got
involved
in
it
before
he
was
aware
richard
was
more
fortunate
having
kept
on
the
right
where
the
ground
was
hard
seeing
nicholas
struggling
out
of
the
marshy
soil
he
would
have
stayed
for
him
but
the
latter
bade
him
go
on
saying
he
would
soon
be
up
with
him
and
he
made
good
his
words
shortly
after
this
their
course
was
intercepted
by
a
brook
and
both
horses
having
cleared
it
excellently
they
kept
well
together
again
for
a
short
time
when
they
neared
a
deep
dyke
which
lay
between
them
and
the
clump
of
trees
on
descrying
it
richard
pointed
out
a
course
to
the
left
but
nicholas
held
on
unheeding
the
caution
fully
expecting
to
see
him
break
his
neck
for
the
dyke
was
of
formidable
width
richard
watched
him
with
apprehension
but
the
squire
gave
him
a
nod
and
went
on
neither
horse
nor
man
faltered
though
failure
would
have
been
certain
destruction
to
both
the
wide
trench
now
yawned
before
them
they
were
upon
its
edge
and
without
trusting
himself
to
measure
it
with
his
eye
nicholas
clapped
spurs
into
robin
sides
the
brave
horse
sprang
forward
and
landed
him
safely
on
the
opposite
bank
hallooing
cheerily
as
soon
as
he
could
check
his
courser
the
squire
wheeled
round
and
rode
back
to
look
at
the
dyke
he
had
crossed
its
width
was
terrific
and
fairly
astounded
him
robin
snorted
loudly
as
if
proud
of
his
achievement
and
showed
some
disposition
to
return
but
the
squire
was
quite
content
with
what
he
had
done
the
exploit
afterwards
became
a
theme
of
wonder
throughout
the
country
and
the
spot
was
long
afterwards
pointed
out
as
squire
nicholas
leap
but
there
was
not
another
horseman
found
daring
enough
to
repeat
the
experiment
richard
had
to
make
a
considerable
circuit
to
join
his
cousin
and
while
he
was
going
round
nicholas
looked
out
for
the
others
in
the
distance
he
could
see
roger
nowell
riding
leisurely
on
followed
by
sparshot
and
a
couple
of
grooms
who
had
come
with
their
master
from
the
hall
while
midway
to
his
surprise
he
perceived
flint
galloping
without
a
rider
a
closer
examination
showed
the
squire
what
had
happened
like
himself
master
potts
had
incautiously
approached
the
swamp
and
getting
entangled
in
it
was
thrown
head
foremost
into
the
slough
out
of
which
he
was
now
floundering
covered
from
head
to
foot
with
slime
as
soon
as
they
were
aware
of
the
accident
the
two
grooms
pushed
forward
and
one
of
them
galloped
after
flint
whom
he
succeeded
at
last
in
catching
while
the
other
with
difficulty
preserving
his
countenance
at
the
woful
plight
of
the
attorney
who
looked
as
black
as
a
negro
pointed
out
a
cottage
in
the
hollow
which
belonged
to
one
of
the
keepers
and
offered
to
conduct
him
thither
potts
gladly
assented
and
soon
gained
the
little
tenement
where
he
was
being
washed
and
rubbed
down
by
a
couple
of
stout
wenches
when
the
rest
of
the
party
came
up
it
was
impossible
to
help
laughing
at
him
but
potts
took
the
merriment
in
good
part
and
to
show
he
was
not
disheartened
by
the
misadventure
as
soon
as
circumstances
would
permit
he
mounted
the
unlucky
pony
and
the
cavalcade
set
forward
again
chapter
the
boggart
glen
the
manor
of
read
it
has
been
said
was
skirted
by
a
deep
woody
ravine
of
three
or
four
miles
in
length
extending
from
the
little
village
of
sabden
in
pendle
forest
to
within
a
short
distance
of
whalley
and
through
this
gully
flowed
a
stream
which
taking
its
rise
near
barley
at
the
foot
of
pendle
hill
added
its
waters
to
those
of
the
calder
at
a
place
called
cock
bridge
in
summer
or
in
dry
seasons
this
stream
proceeded
quietly
enough
and
left
the
greater
part
of
its
stony
bed
unoccupied
but
in
winter
or
after
continuous
rains
it
assumed
all
the
character
of
a
mountain
torrent
and
swept
every
thing
before
it
a
narrow
bridle
road
led
through
the
ravine
to
sabden
and
along
it
after
quitting
the
park
the
cavalcade
proceeded
headed
by
nicholas
the
little
river
danced
merrily
past
them
singing
as
it
went
the
sunshine
sparkling
on
its
bright
clear
waters
and
glittering
on
the
pebbles
beneath
them
now
the
stream
would
chafe
and
foam
against
some
larger
impediment
to
its
course
now
it
would
dash
down
some
rocky
height
and
form
a
beautiful
cascade
then
it
would
hurry
on
for
some
time
with
little
interruption
till
stayed
by
a
projecting
bank
it
would
form
a
small
deep
basin
where
beneath
the
shadow
of
an
overhanging
oak
or
under
its
huge
twisted
and
denuded
roots
the
angler
might
be
sure
of
finding
the
speckled
trout
the
dainty
greyling
or
their
mutual
enemy
the
voracious
jack
the
ravine
was
well
wooded
throughout
and
in
many
parts
singularly
beautiful
from
the
disposition
of
the
timber
on
its
banks
as
well
as
from
the
varied
form
and
character
of
the
trees
here
might
be
seen
an
acclivity
covered
with
waving
birch
or
a
top
crowned
with
a
mountain
ash
there
on
a
smooth
expanse
of
greensward
stood
a
range
of
noble
elms
whose
mighty
arms
stretched
completely
across
the
ravine
further
on
there
were
chestnut
and
walnut
trees
willows
with
hoary
stems
and
silver
leaves
almost
encroaching
upon
the
stream
larches
upon
the
heights
and
here
and
there
upon
some
sandy
eminence
a
spreading
for
the
most
part
the
bottom
of
the
glen
was
overgrown
with
brushwood
and
where
its
sides
were
too
abrupt
to
admit
the
growth
of
larger
trees
they
were
matted
with
woodbine
and
brambles
out
of
these
would
sometimes
start
a
sharp
pinnacle
or
crag
adding
greatly
to
the
picturesque
beauty
of
the
scene
on
such
points
were
not
unfrequently
found
perched
a
hawk
a
falcon
or
some
large
bird
of
prey
for
the
gully
with
its
brakes
and
thickets
was
a
favourite
haunt
of
the
feathered
tribe
the
hollies
of
which
there
were
plenty
with
their
green
prickly
leaves
and
scarlet
berries
afforded
shelter
and
support
to
the
blackbird
the
thorns
were
frequented
by
the
thrush
and
numberless
lesser
songsters
filled
every
other
tree
in
the
covert
there
were
pheasants
and
partridges
in
abundance
and
snipe
and
resorted
to
the
river
in
winter
thither
also
at
all
seasons
repaired
the
stately
heron
to
devour
the
finny
race
and
thither
came
on
like
errand
the
kingfisher
the
magpie
chattered
the
jay
screamed
and
flew
deeper
into
the
woods
as
the
horsemen
approached
and
the
shy
bittern
hid
herself
amid
the
rushes
occasionally
too
was
heard
the
deep
ominous
croaking
of
a
raven
illustration
potts
after
being
thrown
from
his
horse
hitherto
the
glen
had
been
remarkable
for
its
softness
and
beauty
but
it
now
began
to
assume
a
savage
and
sombre
character
the
banks
drew
closer
together
and
became
rugged
and
precipitous
while
the
trees
met
overhead
and
intermingling
their
branches
formed
a
canopy
impervious
to
the
sun
rays
the
stream
was
likewise
contracted
in
its
bed
and
its
current
which
owing
to
the
gloom
looked
black
as
ink
flowed
swiftly
on
as
if
anxious
to
escape
to
livelier
scenes
a
large
raven
which
had
attended
the
horsemen
all
the
way
now
alighted
near
them
and
croaked
ominously
this
part
of
the
glen
was
in
very
ill
repute
and
was
never
traversed
even
at
noonday
without
apprehension
its
wild
and
savage
aspect
its
horrent
precipices
its
shaggy
woods
its
rocks
and
tenebrous
depths
where
every
object
appeared
doubly
frightful
all
combined
to
invest
it
with
mystery
and
terror
no
one
willingly
lingered
here
but
hurried
on
afraid
of
the
sound
of
his
own
footsteps
no
one
dared
to
gaze
at
the
rocks
lest
he
should
see
some
hideous
hobgoblin
peering
out
of
their
fissures
no
one
glanced
at
the
water
for
fear
some
terrible
kelpy
with
twining
snakes
for
hair
and
scaly
hide
should
issue
from
it
and
drag
him
down
to
devour
him
with
his
teeth
among
the
common
folk
this
part
of
the
ravine
was
known
as
the
boggart
glen
and
was
supposed
to
be
haunted
by
mischievous
beings
who
made
the
unfortunate
wanderer
their
sport
for
the
last
the
road
had
been
so
narrow
and
intricate
in
its
windings
that
the
party
were
obliged
to
proceed
singly
but
this
did
not
prevent
conversation
and
nicholas
throwing
the
bridle
over
neck
left
the
surefooted
animal
to
pursue
his
course
unguided
while
he
himself
leaning
back
chatted
with
roger
nowell
at
the
entrance
of
the
gloomy
gorge
above
described
robin
came
to
a
stand
and
refusing
to
move
at
a
jerk
from
his
master
the
latter
raised
himself
and
looked
forward
to
see
what
could
be
the
cause
of
the
stoppage
no
impediment
was
visible
but
the
animal
obstinately
refused
to
go
on
though
urged
both
by
word
and
spur
this
stoppage
necessarily
delayed
the
rest
of
the
cavalcade
well
aware
of
the
ill
reputation
of
the
place
when
simon
sparshot
and
the
grooms
found
that
robin
would
not
go
on
they
declared
he
must
see
the
boggart
and
urged
the
squire
to
turn
back
or
some
mischief
would
befall
him
but
nicholas
though
not
without
misgivings
did
not
like
to
yield
thus
especially
when
urged
on
by
roger
nowell
indeed
the
party
could
not
get
out
of
the
ravine
without
going
back
nearly
a
mile
while
sabden
was
only
half
that
distance
from
them
what
was
to
be
done
robin
still
continued
obstinate
and
for
the
first
time
paid
no
attention
to
his
master
commands
the
poor
animal
was
evidently
a
prey
to
violent
terror
and
snorted
and
reared
while
his
limbs
were
bathed
in
cold
sweat
dismounting
and
leaving
him
in
charge
of
roger
nowell
nicholas
walked
on
by
himself
to
see
if
he
could
discover
any
cause
for
the
alarm
and
he
had
not
advanced
far
when
his
eye
rested
upon
a
blasted
oak
forming
a
conspicuous
object
on
a
crag
before
him
on
a
scathed
branch
of
which
sat
the
raven
croak
croak
croak
accursed
bird
it
is
thou
who
hast
frightened
my
horse
cried
nicholas
would
i
had
a
crossbow
or
an
arquebuss
to
stop
thy
croaking
and
as
he
picked
up
a
stone
to
cast
at
the
raven
a
crashing
noise
was
heard
among
the
bushes
high
up
on
the
rock
and
the
next
moment
a
huge
fragment
dislodged
from
the
cliff
rolled
down
and
would
have
crushed
him
if
he
had
not
nimbly
avoided
it
croak
croak
croak
nicholas
almost
fancied
hoarse
laughter
was
mingled
with
the
cries
of
the
bird
the
raven
nodded
its
head
and
expanded
its
wings
and
the
squire
whose
recent
experience
had
prepared
him
for
any
wonder
fully
expected
to
hear
it
speak
but
it
only
croaked
loudly
and
exultingly
or
if
it
laughed
the
sound
was
like
the
creaking
of
rusty
hinges
nicholas
did
not
like
it
at
all
and
he
resolved
to
go
back
but
ere
he
could
do
so
he
was
startled
by
a
buffet
on
the
ear
and
turning
angrily
round
to
see
who
had
dealt
it
he
could
distinguish
no
one
but
at
the
same
moment
received
a
second
buffet
on
the
other
ear
the
raven
croaked
merrily
would
i
could
wring
thy
neck
accursed
bird
cried
the
enraged
squire
scarcely
was
the
vindictive
wish
uttered
than
a
shower
of
blows
fell
upon
him
and
kicks
from
unseen
feet
were
applied
to
his
person
all
the
while
the
raven
croaked
merrily
and
flapped
his
big
black
wings
infuriated
by
the
attack
the
squire
hit
right
and
left
manfully
and
dashed
out
his
feet
in
every
direction
but
his
blows
and
kicks
only
met
the
empty
air
while
those
of
his
unseen
antagonist
told
upon
his
own
person
with
increased
effect
the
spectacle
seemed
to
afford
infinite
amusement
to
the
raven
the
mischievous
bird
almost
crowed
with
glee
there
was
no
standing
it
any
longer
so
amid
a
perfect
hurricane
of
blows
and
kicks
and
with
the
infernal
voice
of
the
raven
ringing
in
his
ears
the
squire
took
to
his
heels
on
reaching
his
companions
he
found
they
had
not
fared
much
better
than
himself
the
two
grooms
were
belabouring
each
other
lustily
and
master
potts
was
exercising
his
on
the
broad
shoulders
of
sparshot
who
in
return
was
making
him
acquainted
with
the
taste
of
a
stout
assailed
in
the
same
manner
as
the
squire
and
naturally
attributing
the
attack
to
their
nearest
neighbours
they
waited
for
no
explanation
but
fell
upon
each
other
richard
assheton
and
roger
nowell
endeavoured
to
interfere
and
separate
the
combatants
and
in
doing
so
received
some
hard
knocks
for
their
pains
but
all
their
pacific
efforts
were
fruitless
until
the
squire
appeared
and
telling
them
they
were
merely
the
sport
of
hobgoblins
they
desisted
but
still
the
blows
fell
heavily
on
them
as
before
proving
the
truth
of
nicholas
assertion
meanwhile
the
squire
had
mounted
robin
and
finding
the
horse
no
longer
exhibit
the
same
reluctance
to
proceed
he
dashed
at
full
speed
through
the
haunted
glen
but
even
above
the
clatter
of
hoofs
and
the
noise
of
the
party
galloping
after
him
he
could
hear
the
hoarse
exulting
croaking
of
the
raven
as
the
gully
expanded
and
the
sun
once
more
found
its
way
through
the
trees
and
shone
upon
the
river
nicholas
began
to
breathe
more
freely
but
it
was
not
until
fairly
out
of
the
wood
that
he
relaxed
his
speed
not
caring
to
enter
into
any
explanation
of
the
occurrence
he
rode
a
little
apart
to
avoid
conversation
as
the
others
who
were
still
smarting
from
the
blows
they
had
received
were
in
no
very
a
sullen
silence
prevailed
throughout
the
party
as
they
mounted
the
bare
in
the
direction
of
the
few
scattered
huts
constituting
the
village
of
sabden
a
blight
seemed
to
have
fallen
upon
the
place
roger
nowell
who
had
visited
it
a
few
months
ago
could
scarcely
believe
his
eyes
so
changed
was
its
appearance
his
inquiries
as
to
the
cause
of
its
altered
condition
were
every
where
met
by
the
same
answer
the
poor
people
were
all
bewitched
here
a
child
was
ill
of
a
strange
sickness
tossed
and
tumbled
in
its
bed
and
contorted
its
limbs
so
violently
that
its
parents
could
scarcely
hold
it
down
another
family
was
afflicted
in
a
different
manner
two
of
its
number
pining
away
and
losing
strength
daily
as
if
a
prey
to
some
consuming
disease
in
a
third
another
child
was
sick
and
vomited
pins
nails
and
other
extraordinary
substances
a
fourth
household
was
tormented
by
an
imp
in
the
form
of
a
monkey
who
came
at
night
and
pinched
them
all
black
and
blue
spilt
the
milk
broke
the
dishes
and
platters
got
under
the
bed
and
raising
it
to
the
roof
let
it
fall
with
a
terrible
crash
putting
them
all
in
mental
terror
in
the
next
cottage
there
was
no
end
to
calamities
though
they
took
a
more
absurd
form
sometimes
the
fire
would
not
burn
or
when
it
did
it
emitted
no
heat
so
that
the
pot
would
not
boil
nor
the
meat
roast
then
the
oatcakes
would
stick
to
the
and
no
force
could
get
them
away
from
it
till
they
were
burnt
and
spoiled
the
milk
turned
sour
the
cheese
became
so
hard
that
not
even
rats
teeth
could
gnaw
it
the
stools
and
settles
broke
down
if
sat
upon
and
the
list
of
petty
grievances
was
completed
by
a
whole
side
of
bacon
being
devoured
in
a
single
night
roger
nowell
and
nicholas
listened
patiently
to
a
detail
of
all
these
grievances
and
expressed
strong
sympathy
for
the
sufferers
promising
assistance
and
redress
if
possible
all
the
complainants
taxed
either
mother
demdike
or
mother
chattox
with
afflicting
them
and
said
they
had
incurred
the
anger
of
the
two
malevolent
old
witches
by
refusing
to
supply
them
with
poultry
eggs
milk
butter
or
other
articles
which
they
had
demanded
master
potts
made
ample
notes
of
the
strange
relations
and
took
down
the
name
of
every
cottager
at
length
they
arrived
at
the
last
cottage
and
here
a
man
with
a
very
doleful
countenance
besought
them
to
stop
and
listen
to
his
tale
what
is
the
matter

the
description
is
sufficiently
particular
scarcely
precise
enough
returned
potts
however
it
may
do
we
will
help
you
in
the
matter
good
humphrey
etcetera
you
shall
not
be
troubled
with
these
pestilent
witches
much
longer
the
neighbourhood
shall
be
cleared
of
them
ey
reet
glad
to
hear
mester
replied
the
man
you
promise
much
master
potts
observed
richard
not
a
jot
more
than
i
am
able
to
perform
replied
the
attorney
that
remains
to
be
seen
said
richard
if
these
old
women
are
as
powerful
as
represented
they
will
not
be
so
readily
defeated
there
you
are
in
error
master
richard
replied
potts
the
devil
whose
vassals
they
are
will
deliver
them
into
our
hands
granting
what
you
say
to
be
correct
the
devil
must
have
little
regard
for
his
servants
if
he
abandons
them
so
easily
observed
richard
drily
what
else
can
you
expect
from
him
cried
potts
it
is
his
custom
to
ensnare
his
victims
and
then
leave
them
to
their
fate
you
are
rather
describing
the
course
pursued
by
certain
members
of
your
own
profession
master
potts
said
richard
the
devil
behaves
with
greater
fairness
to
his
clients
you
are
not
going
to
defend
him
i
hope
sir
said
the
attorney
no
i
only
desire
to
give
him
his
due
returned
richard
ha
ha
ha
laughed
nicholas
you
had
better
have
done
master
potts
you
will
never
get
the
better
in
the
argument
but
we
must
be
moving
or
we
shall
not
get
our
business
done
before
nightfall
as
to
you
numps
he
added
to
the
poor
man
we
will
not
forget
you
if
any
thing
can
be
done
for
your
relief
rely
upon
it
it
shall
not
be
neglected
ay
ay
said
nowell
the
matter
shall
be
looked
into
and
speedily
and
the
witches
brought
to
justice
said
potts
comfort
yourself
with
that
good
humphrey
etcetera
ay
comfort
yourself
with
that
observed
nicholas
soon
after
this
they
entered
a
wide
dreary
waste
forming
the
bottom
of
the
valley
lying
between
the
heights
of
padiham
and
pendle
hill
and
while
wending
their
way
across
it
they
heard
a
shout
from
the
and
presently
afterwards
perceived
a
man
mounted
on
a
powerful
black
horse
galloping
swiftly
towards
them
the
party
awaited
his
approach
and
the
stranger
speedily
came
up
he
was
a
small
man
habited
in
a
suit
of
rusty
black
and
bore
a
most
extraordinary
and
marked
resemblance
to
master
potts
he
had
the
same
perky
features
the
same
parchment
complexion
the
same
yellow
forehead
as
the
little
attorney
so
surprising
was
the
likeness
that
nicholas
unconsciously
looked
round
for
potts
and
beheld
him
staring
at
the
in
angry
wonder
chapter
the
reeve
of
the
forest
the
surprise
of
the
party
was
by
no
means
diminished
when
the
stranger
spoke
his
voice
exactly
resembled
the
sharp
cracked
tones
of
the
attorney
i
crave
pardon
for
the
freedom
i
have
taken
in
stopping
you
good
masters
he
said
doffing
his
cap
and
saluting
them
respectfully
but
being
aware
of
your
errand
i
am
come
to
attend
you
on
it
and
who
are
you
fellow
who
thus
volunteer
your
services
demanded
roger
nowell
sharply
i
am
one
of
the
reeves
of
the
forest
of
blackburnshire
worshipful
sir
replied
the
stranger
and
as
such
my
presence
at
the
intended
perambulation
of
the
boundaries
of
her
property
has
been
deemed
necessary
by
nutter
as
i
shall
have
to
make
a
representation
of
the
matter
at
the
next
court
of
swainmote
indeed
exclaimed
nowell
but
how
knew
you
we
were
coming
mistress
nutter
sent
me
word
last
night
replied
the
reeve
that
master
nicholas
assheton
and
certain
other
gentlemen
would
come
to
rough
lee
for
the
purpose
of
ascertaining
the
marks
meres
and
boundaries
of
her
property
early
this
morning
and
desired
my
attendance
on
the
occasion
accordingly
i
stationed
myself
on
yon
high
ground
to
look
out
for
you
and
have
been
on
the
watch
for
more
than
an
hour
humph
exclaimed
roger
nowell
and
you
live
in
the
forest
i
live
at
barrowford
worshipful
sir
replied
the
reeve
but
i
have
only
lately
come
there
having
succeeded
maurice
mottisfont
the
other
reeve
who
has
been
removed
by
the
master
forester
to
rossendale
where
i
formerly
dwelt
that
may
account
for
my
not
having
seen
you
before
rejoined
nowell
you
are
well
mounted
sirrah
i
did
not
know
the
master
forester
allowed
his
men
such
horses
as
the
one
you
ride
this
horse
does
not
belong
to
me
sir
replied
the
reeve
it
has
been
lent
me
by
mistress
nutter
aha
i
see
how
it
is
now
cried
nowell
you
are
suborned
to
give
false
testimony
knave
i
object
to
his
attendance
master
nicholas
nay
i
think
you
do
the
man
injustice
said
the
squire
he
speaks
frankly
and
fairly
enough
and
seems
to
know
his
business
the
worst
that
can
be
said
against
him
is
that
he
resembles
somewhat
too
closely
our
little
legal
friend
there
that
however
ought
to
be
no
objection
to
you
master
nowell
but
rather
the
contrary
well
take
the
responsibility
of
the
matter
upon
your
own
shoulders
said
nowell
if
any
ill
comes
of
it
i
shall
blame
you
be
it
so
replied
the
squire
my
shoulders
are
broad
enough
to
bear
the
burthen
you
may
ride
with
us
master
reeve
may
i
inquire
your
name
friend
said
potts
as
the
stranger
fell
back
to
the
rear
of
the
party
thomas
potts
at
your
service
sir
replied
the
reeve
what
thomas
potts
exclaimed
the
astonished
attorney
that
is
my
name
sir
replied
the
reeve
quietly
why
zounds
exclaimed
nicholas
who
overheard
the
reply
you
do
not
mean
to
say
your
name
is
thomas
potts
this
is
more
wonderful
still
you
must
be
this
gentleman
twin
brother
the
gentleman
certainly
seems
to
resemble
me
very
strongly
replied
the
reeve
apparently
surprised
in
his
turn
is
he
of
these
parts
no
i
am
not
returned
potts
angrily
i
am
from
london
where
i
reside
in
and
practise
the
law
though
i
likewise
attend
as
clerk
of
the
court
at
the
assizes
at
lancaster
where
i
may
possibly
one
of
these
days
have
the
pleasure
of
seeing
you
my
pretended
namesake
possibly
sir
said
the
reeve
with
provoking
calmness
i
myself
am
from
chester
and
like
yourself
was
brought
up
to
the
law
but
i
abandoned
my
profession
or
rather
it
abandoned
me
for
i
had
few
clients
so
i
took
to
an
honester
calling
and
became
a
forester
as
you
see
my
father
was
a
draper
in
the
city
i
have
mentioned
and
dwelt
in
his
name
was
peter
potts
peter
potts
your
father
exclaimed
the
attorney
in
the
last
state
of
astonishment
why
he
was
mine
but
i
am
his
only
son
up
to
this
moment
i
conceived
myself
an
only
son
said
the
reeve
but
it
seems
i
was
mistaken
since
i
find
i
have
an
elder
brother
elder
brother
exclaimed
potts
wrathfully
you
are
older
than
i
am
by
twenty
years
but
it
is
all
a
fabrication
i
deny
the
relationship
entirely
you
can
not
make
me
other
than
the
son
of
my
father
said
the
reeve
with
a
smile
well
master
potts
interposed
nicholas
laughing
i
see
no
reason
why
you
should
be
ashamed
of
your
brother
there
is
a
strong
family
likeness
between
you
so
old
peter
potts
the
draper
of
chester
was
your
father
eh
i
was
not
aware
of
the
circumstance
before
ha
ha
and
but
for
this
intrusive
fellow
you
would
never
have
become
aware
of
it
muttered
the
attorney
give
ear
to
me
squire
he
said
urging
flint
close
up
to
the
other
side
and
speaking
in
a
low
tone
i
do
not
like
the
fellow
looks
at
all
i
am
surprised
at
that
rejoined
the
squire
for
he
exactly
resembles
you
that
is
why
i
do
not
like
him
said
potts
i
believe
him
to
be
a
wizard
you
are
no
wizard
to
think
so
rejoined
the
squire
and
he
rode
on
to
join
roger
nowell
who
was
a
little
in
advance
i
will
try
him
on
the
subject
of
witchcraft
thought
potts
as
you
dwell
in
the
forest
he
said
to
the
reeve
you
have
no
doubt
seen
those
two
terrible
beings
mothers
demdike
and
chattox
frequently
replied
the
reeve
but
i
would
rather
not
talk
about
them
in
their
own
territories
you
may
judge
of
their
power
by
the
appearance
of
the
village
you
have
just
quitted
the
inhabitants
of
that
unlucky
place
refused
them
their
customary
tributes
and
have
therefore
incurred
their
resentment
you
will
meet
other
instances
of
the
like
kind
before
you
have
gone
far
i
am
glad
of
it
for
i
want
to
collect
as
many
cases
as
i
can
of
witchcraft
observed
potts
they
will
be
of
little
use
to
you
observed
the
reeve
how
so
inquired
potts
because
if
the
witches
discover
what
you
are
about
as
they
will
not
fail
to
do
you
will
never
leave
the
forest
alive
returned
the
other
you
think
not
cried
potts
i
am
sure
of
it
replied
the
reeve
i
will
not
be
deterred
from
the
performance
of
my
duty
said
potts
i
defy
the
devil
and
all
his
works
you
may
have
reason
to
repent
your
temerity
replied
the
reeve
and
anxious
apparently
to
avoid
further
conversation
on
the
subject
he
drew
in
the
rein
for
a
moment
and
allowed
the
attorney
to
pass
on
notwithstanding
his
boasting
master
potts
was
not
without
much
secret
misgiving
but
his
constitutional
obstinacy
made
him
determine
to
prosecute
his
plans
at
any
risk
and
he
comforted
himself
by
recalling
the
opinion
of
his
sovereign
authority
on
such
matters
let
me
ponder
over
the
exact
words
of
our
british
solomon
he
thought
i
have
his
learned
treatise
by
heart
and
it
is
fortunate
my
memory
serves
me
so
well
for
the
sagacious
prince
dictum
will
fortify
me
in
my
resolution
which
has
been
somewhat
shaken
by
this
fellow
whom
i
believe
to
be
no
better
than
he
should
be
for
all
he
calls
himself
my
father
son
and
hath
assumed
my
likeness
doubtless
for
some
mischievous
purpose
the
magistrate
saith
the
king
slothful
towards
witches
god
is
very
able
to
make
them
instruments
to
waken
and
punish
his
sloth
no
one
can
accuse
me
of
slothfulness
and
want
of
zeal
my
best
exertions
have
been
used
against
the
accursed
creatures
and
now
for
the
rest
if
on
the
contrary
he
be
diligent
in
examining
and
punishing
them
god
will
not
permit
their
master
to
trouble
or
hinder
so
good
a
work
exactly
what
i
have
done
i
am
quite
easy
now
and
shall
go
on
fearlessly
as
before
i
am
one
of
the
lieutenants
described
by
the
king
and
can
not
be
or
deprived
of
my
office
as
these
thoughts
passed
through
the
attorney
mind
a
low
derisive
laugh
sounded
in
his
ears
and
connecting
it
with
the
reeve
he
looked
back
and
found
the
object
of
his
suspicions
gazing
at
him
and
chuckling
maliciously
so
fiendishly
malignant
indeed
was
the
gaze
fixed
upon
him
that
potts
was
glad
to
turn
his
head
away
to
avoid
it
i
am
confirmed
in
my
suspicions
he
thought
he
is
evidently
a
wizard
if
he
be
not
again
the
mocking
laugh
sounded
in
his
ears
but
he
did
not
venture
to
look
round
this
time
being
fearful
of
once
more
encountering
the
terrible
gaze
meanwhile
the
party
had
traversed
the
valley
and
to
avoid
a
dangerous
morass
stretching
across
its
lower
extremity
and
shorten
the
distance
for
the
ordinary
road
would
have
led
them
too
much
to
the
right
they
began
to
climb
one
of
the
ridges
of
pendle
hill
which
lay
between
them
and
the
vale
they
wished
to
gain
on
obtaining
the
top
of
this
eminence
an
extensive
view
on
either
side
opened
upon
them
behind
was
the
sterile
valley
they
had
just
crossed
its
black
soil
hoary
grass
and
heathy
wastes
only
enlivened
at
one
end
by
patches
of
bright
moss
which
masked
a
treacherous
quagmire
lurking
beneath
it
some
of
the
cottages
in
sabden
were
visible
and
from
the
sad
circumstances
connected
with
them
and
which
oppressed
the
thoughts
of
the
beholders
added
to
the
dreary
character
of
the
prospect
the
day
too
had
lost
its
previous
splendour
and
there
were
clouds
overhead
which
cast
deep
shadows
on
the
ground
but
on
the
crest
of
pendle
hill
which
rose
above
them
a
fell
and
attracted
attention
from
its
brilliant
contrast
to
the
prevailing
gloom
before
them
lay
a
deep
gully
the
sinuosities
of
which
could
be
traced
from
the
elevated
position
where
they
stood
though
its
termination
was
hidden
by
other
projecting
ridges
further
on
the
sides
of
the
mountain
were
bare
and
rugged
and
covered
with
shelving
stone
beyond
the
defile
before
mentioned
and
over
the
last
mountain
ridge
lay
a
wide
valley
bounded
on
the
further
side
by
the
hills
overlooking
colne
and
the
mountain
defile
now
laid
open
to
the
travellers
exhibiting
in
the
midst
of
the
dark
heathy
ranges
which
were
its
distinguishing
features
some
marks
of
cultivation
in
parts
it
was
inclosed
and
divided
into
paddocks
by
stone
walls
and
here
and
there
a
few
cottages
were
collected
together
dignified
as
in
the
case
of
sabden
by
the
name
of
a
village
amongst
these
were
the
an
assemblage
of
small
stone
tenements
the
earliest
that
arose
in
the
forest
goldshaw
booth
now
a
populous
place
and
even
then
the
largest
hamlet
in
the
district
and
in
the
distance
ogden
and
barley
the
two
latter
scarcely
comprising
a
dozen
habitations
and
those
little
better
than
huts
in
some
sheltered
nook
on
the
might
be
discerned
the
solitary
cottage
of
a
cowherd
and
not
far
from
it
the
certain
accompaniment
of
a
sheepfold
throughout
this
weird
region
thinly
peopled
it
is
true
but
still
of
great
extent
and
apparently
abandoned
to
the
powers
of
darkness
only
one
edifice
could
be
found
where
its
inhabitants
could
meet
to
pray
and
this
was
an
ancient
chapel
at
goldshaw
booth
originally
erected
in
the
reign
of
henry
though
subsequently
in
part
rebuilt
in
and
which
with
its
low
grey
tower
peeping
from
out
the
trees
was
just
discernible
two
halls
were
in
view
one
of
which
sabden
was
of
considerable
antiquity
and
gave
its
name
to
the
village
and
the
other
was
hoarstones
a
much
more
recently
erected
mansion
strikingly
situated
on
an
acclivity
of
pendle
hill
in
general
the
upper
parts
of
this
mountain
monarch
of
the
waste
were
bare
and
heathy
while
the
heights
overhanging
ogden
and
barley
were
rocky
shelving
and
precipitous
but
the
lower
ridges
were
well
covered
with
wood
and
a
thicket
once
forming
part
of
the
ancieut
forest
ran
far
out
into
the
plain
near
goldshaw
booth
numerous
springs
burst
from
the
mountain
side
and
these
collecting
their
forces
formed
a
considerable
stream
which
under
the
name
of
pendle
water
flowed
through
the
valley
above
described
and
after
many
picturesque
windings
entered
the
rugged
glen
in
which
rough
lee
was
situated
and
swept
past
the
foot
of
mistress
nutter
residence
descending
the
hill
and
passing
through
the
thicket
the
party
came
within
a
short
distance
of
goldshaw
booth
when
they
were
met
by
a
cowherd
who
with
looks
of
great
alarm
told
them
that
john
law
the
pedlar
had
fallen
down
in
a
fit
in
the
clough
and
would
perish
if
they
did
not
stay
to
help
him
as
the
poor
man
in
question
was
well
known
both
to
nicholas
and
roger
nowell
they
immediately
agreed
to
go
to
his
assistance
and
accompanied
the
cowherd
along
a
which
led
through
the
clough
to
the
village
they
had
not
gone
far
when
they
heard
loud
groans
and
presently
afterwards
found
the
unfortunate
pedlar
lying
on
his
back
and
writhing
in
agony
he
was
a
large
man
of
middle
age
and
had
been
in
the
full
enjoyment
of
health
and
vigour
so
that
his
sudden

indeed
john
said
richard
especially
if
it
be
the
result
of
witchcraft
you
do
not
surely
doubt
that
it
is
so
master
richard
cried
potts
i
offer
no
opinion
replied
the
young
man
but
a
paralytic
stroke
would
produce
the
same
effect
but
instead
of
discussing
the
matter
the
best
thing
we
can
do
will
be
to
transport
the
poor
man
to
bess
th
booth
where
he
can
be
attended
to
tom
and
i
can
carry
him
there
if
abel

of

said
one
of
the
grooms
that
i
win
replied
the
cowherd
unstrapping
the
box
upon
which
the
sufferer
head
rested
and
placing
it
on
his
own
shoulders
meanwhile
a
gate
having
been
taken
from
its
hinges
by
sparshot
and
the
reeve
the
poor
pedlar
who
groaned
deeply
during
the
operation
was
placed
upon
it
by
the
men
and
borne
towards
the
village
followed
by
the
others
leading
their
horses
great
consternation
was
occasioned
in
goldshaw
booth
by
the
entrance
of
the
cavalcade
and
still
more
when
it
became
known
that
john
law
the
pedlar
who
was
a
favourite
with
all
had
had
a
frightful
seizure
old
and
young
flocked
forth
to
see
him
and
the
former
shook
their
heads
while
the
latter
were
appalled
at
the
hideous
sight
master
potts
took
care
to
tell
them
that
the
poor
fellow
was
bewitched
by
mother
demdike
but
the
information
failed
to
produce
the
effect
he
anticipated
and
served
rather
to
repress
than
heighten
their
sympathy
for
the
sufferer
the
attorney
concluded
and
justly
that
they
were
afraid
of
incurring
the
displeasure
of
the
vindictive
old
hag
by
an
open
expression
of
interest
in
his
fate
so
strongly
did
this
feeling
operate
that
after
bestowing
a
glance
of
commiseration
at
the
pedlar
most
of
them
returned
without
a
word
to
their
dwellings
on
their
way
to
the
little
hostel
whither
they
were
conveying
the
poor
pedlar
the
party
passed
the
church
and
the
sexton
who
was
digging
a
grave
in
the
yard
came
forward
to
look
at
them
but
on
seeing
john
law
he
seemed
to
understand
what
had
happened
and
resumed
his
employment
a
grew
in
this
part
of
the
churchyard
and
near
it
stood
a
small
cross
rudely
carved
in
granite
marking
the
spot
where
in
the
reign
of
henry
ralph
cliderhow
tenth
abbot
of
whalley
held
a
meeting
of
the
tenantry
to
check
encroachments
not
far
from
this
ancient
cross
the
sexton
a
hale
old
man
with
a
fresh
complexion
and
silvery
hair
was
at
work
and
while
the
others
went
on
master
potts
paused
to
say
a
word
to
him
you

a
funeral
here
i

said
yeigh
replied
the
man
gruffly
one
of
the
villagers
inquired
the
attorney

replied
the
sexton
where
then

the

nodded
his

and
began
to

potts
taking
out
his

the
sexton
again
nodded
his

but
spake
no

and
meeting
some
obstruction
in
the
ground
took
up
his
pick
to

zachariah
replied
potts
and
having
obtained
all
he
required
he
proceeded
to
the
little
hostel
where
finding
the
rest
of
the
party
had
dismounted
he
consigned
flint
to
a
cowherd
and
entered
the
house
chapter
bess
o
th

bess
o
th
booth
for
so
the
little
hostel
at
goldshaw
was
called
after
its
mistress
bess
whitaker
was
far
more
comfortable
and
commodious
than
its
unpretending
exterior
seemed
to
warrant
stouter
and
brighter
ale
was
not
to
be
drunk
in
lancashire
than
bess
brewed
nor
was
better
sherris
or
clary
to
be
found
go
where
you
would
than
in
her
cellars
the
traveller
crossing
those
dreary
wastes
and
riding
from
burnley
to
clithero
or
from
colne
to
whalley
as
the
case
might
be
might
well
halt
at
bess
and
be
sure
of
a
roast
fowl
for
dinner
with
the
addition
perhaps
of
some
trout
from
pendle
water
or
if
the
season
permitted
a
or
a
pheasant
or
if
he
tarried
there
for
the
night
he
was
equally
sure
of
a
good
supper
and
fair
linen
it
has
already
been
mentioned
that
at
this
period
it
was
the
custom
of
all
classes
in
the
northern
counties
men
and
women
to
resort
to
the
alehouses
to
drink
and
the
hostel
at
goldshaw
was
the
general
rendezvous
of
the
neighbourhood
for
those
who
could
afford
it
bess
would
brew
incomparable
sack
but
if
a
guest
called
for
wine
and
she
liked
not
his
looks
she
would
flatly
tell
him
her
ale
was
good
enough
for
him
and
if
it
pleased
him
not
he
should
have
nothing
submission
always
followed
in
such
cases
for
there
was
no
disputing
with
bess
neither
would
she
permit
the
frequenters
of
the
hostel
to
sit
later
than
she
chose
and
would
clear
the
house
in
a
way
equally
characteristic
and
effectual
at
a
certain
hour
and
that
by
no
means
a
late
one
she
would
take
down
a
large
horsewhip
which
hung
on
a
convenient
peg
in
the
principal
room
and
after
bluntly
ordering
her
guests
to
go
home
if
any
resistance
were
offered
she
would
lay
the
whip
across
their
shoulders
and
forcibly
eject
them
from
the
premises
but
as
her
determined
character
was
well
known
this
violence
was
seldom
necessary
in
strength
bess
was
a
match
for
any
man
and
assistance
from
her
cowherds
for
she
was
a
farmer
as
well
as
hostess
was
at
hand
if
required
as
will
be
surmised
from
the
above
bess
was
large
and
but
nevertheless
and
possessed
a
certain
coarse
kind
of
beauty
which
in
earlier
years
had
inflamed
richard
baldwyn
the
miller
of
rough
lee
who
made
overtures
of
marriage
to
her
these
were
favourably
entertained
but
a
slight
quarrel
occurring
between
them
the
lover
in
her
own
phrase
got
his
jacket
soundly
dusted
by
her
and
declared
off
taking
to
wife
a
more
docile
and
maiden
as
to
bess
though
she
had
given
this
unmistakable
proof
of
her
ability
to
manage
a
husband
she
did
not
receive
a
second
offer
nor
as
she
had
now
attained
the
mature
age
of
forty
did
it
seem
likely
she
would
ever
receive
one
bess
o
th
booth
was
an
extremely
clean
and
comfortable
house
the
floor
it
is
true
was
of
hard
clay
and
the
windows
little
more
than
narrow
slits
with
heavy
stone
frames
further
darkened
by
minute
diamond
panes
but
the
benches
were
scrupulously
clean
and
so
was
the
long
oak
table
in
the
centre
of
the
principal
and
only
large
room
in
the
house
a
roundabout
fireplace
occupied
one
end
of
the
chamber
sheltered
from
the
draught
of
the
door
by
a
dark
oak
screen
with
a
bench
on
the
warm
side
of
it
and
here
or
in
the
deep
on
winter
nights
the
neighbours
would
sit
and
chat
by
the
blazing
hearth
discussing
pots
of
nappy
ale
good
and
stale
as
the
old
ballad
hath
it
and
as
persons
of
both
sexes
came
thither
young
as
well
as
old
many
a
match
was
struck
up
by
bess
cheery
fireside
from
the
blackened
rafters
hung
a
goodly
supply
of
hams
sides
of
bacon
and
dried
tongues
with
a
profusion
of
oatcakes
in
a
while
in
case
this
store
should
be
exhausted
means
of
replenishment
were
at
hand
in
the
huge
standing
in
one
corner
altogether
there
was
a
look
of
abundance
as
well
as
of
comfort
about
the
place
great
was
bess
consternation
when
the
poor
pedlar
who
had
quitted
her
house
little
more
than
an
hour
ago
full
of
health
and
spirits
was
brought
back
to
it
in
such
a
deplorable
condition
and
when
she
saw
him
deposited
at
her
door
notwithstanding
her
masculine
character
she
had
some
difficulty
in
repressing
a
scream
she
did
not
however
yield
to
the
weakness
but
seeing
at
once
what
was
best
to
be
done
caused
him
to
be
transported
by
the
grooms
to
the
chamber
he
had
occupied
and
laid
upon
the
bed
medical
assistance
was
fortunately
at
hand
for
it
chanced
that
master
sudall
the
chirurgeon
of
colne
was
in
the
house
at
the
time
having
been
brought
to
goldshaw
by
the
great
sickness
that
prevailed
at
sabden
and
elsewhere
in
the
neighbourhood
sudall
was
immediately
in
attendance
upon
the
sufferer
and
bled
him
copiously
after
which
the
poor
man
seemed
much
easier
and
richard
assheton
taking
the
chirurgeon
aside
asked
his
opinion
of
the
case
and
was
told
by
sudall
that
he
did
not
think
the
pedlar
life
in
danger
but
he
doubted
whether
he
would
ever
recover
the
use
of
his
limbs
you
do
not
attribute
the
attack
to
witchcraft
i
suppose
master
sudall
said
richard
i
do
not
like
to
deliver
an
opinion
sir
replied
the
chirurgeon
it
is
impossible
to
decide
when
all
the
appearances
are
precisely
like
those
of
an
ordinary
attack
of
paralysis
but
a
sad
case
has
recently
come
under
my
observation
as
to
which
i
can
have
no
doubt
i
mean
as
to
its
being
the
result
of
witchcraft
but
i
will
tell
you
more
about
it
presently
for
i
must
now
return
to
my
patient
it
being
agreed
among
the
party
to
rest
for
an
hour
at
the
little
hostel
and
partake
of
some
refreshment
nicholas
went
to
look
after
the
horses
while
roger
nowell
and
richard
remained
in
the
room
with
the
pedlar
bess
whitaker
owned
an
extensive
provided
with
stables
and
a
large
barn
and
it
was
to
the
latter
place
that
the
two
grooms
proposed
to
repair
with
sparshot
and
play
a
game
at
loggats
on
the
clay
floor
no
one
knew
what
had
become
of
the
reeve
for
on
depositing
the
poor
pedlar
at
the
door
of
the
hostel
he
had
mounted
his
horse
and
ridden
away
having
ordered
some
fried
eggs
and
bacon
nicholas
wended
his
way
to
the
stable
while
bess
assisted
by
a
stout
kitchen
wench
busied
herself
in
preparing
the
eatables
and
it
was
at
this
juncture
that
master
potts
entered
the
house
bess
eyed
him
narrowly
and
was
by
no
means
prepossessed
by
his
looks
while
the
muddy
condition
of
his
habiliments
did
not
tend
to
exalt
him
in
her
opinion
yo
mey
yersel
a
whoam

she
observed
as
the
attorney
seated
himself
on
the
bench

potts
where

a
man

true
bess
replied
the
squire
and
the
best
plan
therefore
is
to
make
the
most
of
the
passing
moment
so
brew
us
each
a
lusty
pottle
of
sack
and
fry
us
some
more
eggs
and
bacon
and
while
the
hostess
proceeded
to
prepare
the
sack
potts
remarked
to
nicholas
i

squire
mary

neaw
so
fur

mark
this
time
replied
bess
adding
eggs
sugar
and
spice
to
the
now
boiling
wine
and
stirring
up
the
compound
i
wonder
where
your
brother
the
reeve
of
the
forest
can
be
master
potts
observed
nicholas
i
did
not
see
either
him
or
his
horse
at
the
stables
perhaps
the
arch
impostor
has
taken
himself
off
altogether
said
potts
and
if
so
i
shall
be
sorry
for
i
have
not
done
with
him
the
sack
was
now
set
before
them
and
pronounced
excellent
and
while
they
were
engaged
in
discussing
it
together
with
a
fresh
supply
of
eggs
and
bacon
fried
by
the
kitchen
wench
roger
nowell
came
out
of
the
inner
room
accompanied
by
richard
and
the
chirurgeon
well
master
sudall
how
goes
on
your
patient
inquired
nicholas
of
the
latter
much
more
favourably
than
i
expected
squire
replied
the
chirurgeon
he
will
be
better
left
alone
for
awhile
and
as
i
shall
not
quit
the
village
till
evening
i
shall
be
able
to
look
well
after
him
you
think
the
attack
occasioned
by
witchcraft
of
course
sir
said
potts
the
poor
fellow
affirms
it
to
be
so
but
i
can
give
no
opinion
replied
sudall
evasively
you
must
make
up
your
mind
as
to
the
matter
for
i
think
it
right
to
tell
you
your
evidence
will
be
required
said
potts
perhaps
you
may
have
seen
poor
mary
baldwyn
the
miller
daughter
of
rough
lee
and
can
speak
more
positively
as
to
her
case
i
can
sir
replied
the
chirurgeon
seating
himself
beside
potts
while
roger
nowell
and
richard
placed
themselves
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
table
this
is
the
case
i
referred
to
a
short
time
ago
when
answering
your
inquiries
on
the
same
subject
master
richard
and
a
most
afflicting
one
it
is
but
you
shall
have
the
particulars
six
months
ago
mary
baldwyn
was
as
lovely
and
blooming
a
lass
as
could
be
seen
the
joy
of
her
widowed
father
heart
a
obstinate
man
is
richard
baldwyn
and
he
was
unwise
enough
to
incur
the
displeasure
of
mother
demdike
by
favouring
her
rival
old
chattox
to
whom
he
gave
flour
and
meal
while
he
refused
the
same
tribute
to
the
other
the
first
time
mother
demdike
was
dismissed
without
the
customary
dole
one
of
his
millstones
broke
and
instead
of
taking
this
as
a
warning
he
became
more
obstinate
she
came
a
second
time
and
he
sent
her
away
with
curses
then
all
his
flour
grew
damp
and
musty
and
no
one
would
buy
it
still
he
remained
obstinate
and
when
she
appeared
again
he
would
have
laid
hands
upon
her
but
she
raised
her
staff
and
the
blows
fell
short
have
given
thee
two
warnings
richard
she
said
thou
hast
paid
no
heed
to
them
now
i
will
make
thee
smart
lad
in
right
earnest
that
which
thou
lovest
best
thou
shalt
lose
upon
this
bethinking
him
that
the
dearest
thing
he
had
in
the
world
was
his
daughter
mary
and
afraid
of
harm
happening
to
her
richard
would
fain
have
made
up
his
quarrel
with
the
old
witch
but
it
had
now
gone
too
far
and
she
would
not
listen
to
him
but
uttering
some
words
with
which
the
name
of
the
girl
was
mingled
shook
her
staff
at
the
house
and
departed
the
next
day
poor
mary
was
taken
ill
and
her
father
in
despair
applied
to
old
chattox
who
promised
him
help
and
did
her
best
i
make
no
doubt
for
she
would
have
willingly
thwarted
her
rival
and
robbed
her
of
her
prey
but
the
latter
was
too
strong
for
her
and
the
hapless
victim
got
daily
worse
and
worse
her
blooming
cheek
grew
white
and
hollow
her
dark
eyes
glistened
with
unnatural
lustre
and
she
was
seen
no
more
on
the
banks
of
pendle
water
before
this
my
aid
had
been
called
in
by
the
afflicted
father
and
i
did
all
i
could
but
i
knew
she
would
die
and
i
told
him
so
the
information
i
feared
had
killed
him
for
he
fell
down
like
a
stone
and
i
repented
having
spoken
however
he
recovered
and
made
a
last
appeal
to
mother
demdike
but
the
unrelenting
hag
derided
him
and
cursed
him
telling
him
if
he
brought
her
all
his
mill
contained
and
added
to
that
all
his
substance
she
would
not
spare
his
child
he
returned
and
never
quitted
the
poor
girl
bedside
till
she
breathed
her
last
poor
ruchot
robb
o
his
ownly
dowter
an
neaw
woife
to
cheer
him
ey
pity

fro
t
bottom
o
my
heart
said
bess
whose
tears
had
flowed
freely
during
the
narration
he
is
wellnigh
crazed
with
grief
said
the
chirurgeon
i
hope
he
will
commit
no
rash
act
expressions
of
deep
commiseration
for
the
untimely
death
of
the
daughter
had
been
uttered
by
all
the
party
and
they
were
talking
over
the
strange
circumstances
attending
it
when
they
were
roused
by
the
trampling
of
horses
feet
at
the
door
and
the
moment
after
a
man
clad
in
deep
mourning
but
put
on
in
a
manner
that
betrayed
the
disorder
of
his
mind
entered
the
house
his
looks
were
wild
and
frenzied
his
cheeks
haggard
and
he
rushed
into
the
room
so
abruptly
that
he
did
not
at
first
observe
the
company
assembled
why
richard
baldwyn
is
that
you
cried
the
chirurgeon
what
is

the

the

and

my
good

resolution

stake
cried
potts
but
his
enthusiasm
was
suddenly
checked
by
observing
the
reeve
of
the
forest
peeping
from
behind
the
wainscot
and
earnestly
regarding
the
miller
and
he
called
the
attention
of
the
latter
to
him
richard
baldwyn
mechanically
followed
the
expressive
gestures
of
the
attorney
but
he
saw
no
one
for
the
reeve
had
disappeared
the
incident
passed
unnoticed
by
the
others
who
had
been
too
deeply
moved
by
poor
baldwyn
outburst
of
grief
to
pay
attention
to
it
after
a
little
while
bess
whitaker
succeeded
in
prevailing
upon
the
miller
to
sit
down
and
when
he
became
more
composed
he
told
her
that
the
funeral
procession
consisting
of
some
of
his
neighbours
who
had
undertaken
to
attend
his
daughter
to
her
last
home
was
coming
from
rough
lee
to
goldshaw
but
that
unable
to
bear
them
company
he
had
ridden
on
by
himself
it
appeared
also
from
his
muttered
threats
that
he
had
meditated
some
wild
project
of
vengeance
against
mother
demdike
which
he
intended
to
put
into
execution
before
the
day
was
over
but
master
potts
endeavoured
to
dissuade
him
from
this
course
assuring
him
that
the
most
certain
and
efficacious
mode
of
revenge
he
could
adopt
would
be
through
the
medium
of
the
law
and
that
he
would
give
him
his
best
advice
and
assistance
in
the
matter
while
they
were
talking
thus
the
bell
began
to
toll
and
every
stroke
seemed
to
vibrate
through
the
heart
of
the
afflicted
father
who
was
at
last
so
overpowered
by
grief
that
the
hostess
deemed
it
expedient
to
lead
him
into
an
inner
room
where
he
might
indulge
his
sorrow
unobserved
without
awaiting
the
issue
of
this
painful
scene
richard
who
was
much
affected
by
it
went
forth
and
taking
his
horse
from
the
stable
with
the
intention
of
riding
on
slowly
before
the
others
led
the
animal
towards
the
churchyard
when
within
a
short
distance
of
the
grey
old
fabric
he
paused
the
bell
continued
to
toll
mournfully
and
deepened
the
melancholy
hue
of
his
thoughts
the
sad
tale
he
had
heard
held
possession
of
his
mind
and
while
he
pitied
poor
mary
baldwyn
he
began
to
entertain
apprehensions
that
alizon
might
meet
a
similar
fate
so
many
strange
circumstances
had
taken
place
during
the
morning
ride
he
had
listened
to
so
many
dismal
relations
that
coupled
with
the
dark
and
mysterious
events
of
the
previous
night
he
was
quite
bewildered
and
felt
oppressed
as
if
by
a
hideous
nightmare
which
it
was
impossible
to
shake
off
he
thought
of
mothers
demdike
and
chattox
could
these
dread
beings
be
permitted
to
exercise
such
baneful
influence
over
mankind
with
all
the
apparent
proofs
of
their
power
he
had
received
he
still
strove
to
doubt
and
to
persuade
himself
that
the
various
cases
of
witchcraft
described
to
him
were
only
held
to
be
such
by
the
timid
and
the
credulous
full
of
these
meditations
he
tied
his
horse
to
a
tree
and
entered
the
churchyard
and
while
pursuing
a
path
shaded
by
a
row
of
young
leading
to
the
porch
he
perceived
at
a
little
distance
from
him
near
the
cross
erected
by
abbot
cliderhow
two
persons
who
attracted
his
attention
one
was
the
sexton
who
was
now
deep
in
the
grave

the

old
woman
with
her
back
towards
him
neither
had
remarked
his
approach
and
influenced
by
an
unaccountable
feeling
of
curiosity
he
stood
still
to
watch
their
proceedings
presently
the
sexton
who
was
shovelling
out
the
mould
paused
in
his
task
and
the
old
woman
in
a
hoarse
voice
which
seemed
familiar
to
the
listener
said

the
hag

inquired
the
sexton
ay
replied
the
hag
with
the
demdikes
she
passes
for
one
of
them
but
she
is
not
of
them
nevertheless
i
hate
her

and
as

cried
the
hag
and
yet
mother
demdike
had
no
pity
on
her
an
that
true
replied
the
sexton
weel
weel
do
your
bidding

exclaimed
richard
stepping
forward
i
will
not
suffer
this
abomination
to
be
practised
who
is
it
speaks
to
me
cried
the
hag
turning
round
and
disclosing
the
hideous
countenance
of
mother
chattox
the
voice
is
that
of
richard
assheton
it
is
richard
assheton
who
speaks
cried
the
young
man
and
i
command
you
to
desist
from
this
wickedness
give
me
that
clay
image
he
cried
snatching
it
from
the
sexton
and
trampling
it
to
dust
beneath
his
feet
thus
i
destroy
thy
impious
handiwork
and
defeat
thy
evil
intentions
ah
thou
so
lad
rejoined
mother
chattox
thou
wilt
find
thyself
mistaken
my
curse
has
already
alighted
upon
thee
and
it
shall
work
thou
i
know
it
but
she
shall
never
be
thine
now
go
thy
ways
i
will
go
replied
richard
but
you
shall
come
with
me
old
woman
dare
you
lay
hands
on
me
screamed
the
hag
nay
let
her
be
mester
interposed
the
sexton
yo
had
better
you
are
as
bad
as
she
is
said
richard
and
deserve
equal
punishment
you
escaped
yesterday
at
whalley
old
woman
but
you
shall
not
escape
me
now
be
not
too
sure
of
that
cried
the
hag
disabling
him
for
the
moment
by
a
severe
blow
on
the
arm
from
her
staff
and
shuffling
off
with
an
agility
which
could
scarcely
have
been
expected
from
her
she
passed
through
a
gate
near
her
and
disappeared
behind
a
high
wall
richard
would
have
followed
but
he
was
detained
by
the
sexton
who
besought
him
as
he
valued
his
life
not
to
interfere
and
when
at
last
he
broke
away
from
the
old
man
he
could
see
nothing
of
her
and
only
heard
the
sound
of
horses
feet
in
the
distance
either
his
eyes
deceived
him
or
at
a
turn
in
the
woody
lane
skirting
the
church
he
descried
the
reeve
of
the
forest
galloping
off
with
the
old
woman
behind
him
this
lane
led
towards
rough
lee
and
without
a
hesitation
richard
flew
to
the
spot
where
he
had
left
his
horse
and
mounting
him
rode
swiftly
along
it
chapter
the
temptation
shortly
after
richard
departure
a
round
personage
whose
rusty
black
cassock
hastily
huddled
over
a
dark
proclaimed
him
a
churchman
entered
the
hostel
this
was
the
rector
of
goldshaw
parson
holden
a
very
worthy
little
man
though
rather
perhaps
too
fond
of
the
sports
of
the
field
and
the
bottle
to
roger
nowell
and
nicholas
assheton
he
was
of
course
well
known
and
was
much
esteemed
by
the
latter
often
riding
over
to
hunt
and
fish
or
carouse
at
downham
parson
holden
had
been
sent
for
by
bess
to
administer
spiritual
consolation
to
poor
richard
baldwyn
who
she
thought
stood
in
need
of
it
and
having
respectfully
saluted
the
magistrate
of
whom
he
stood
somewhat
in
awe
and
shaken
hands
cordially
with
nicholas
who
was
delighted
to
see
him
he
repaired
to
the
inner
room
promising
to
come
back
speedily
and
he
kept
his
word
for
in
less
than
five
minutes
he
reappeared
with
the
satisfactory
intelligence
that
the
afflicted
miller
was
considerably
calmer
and
had
listened
to
his
counsels
with
much
edification
take
him
a
glass
of
aquavitæ
bess
he
said
to
the
hostess
he
is
evidently
a
cup
too
low
and
will
be
the
better
for
it
strong
water
is
a
specific
i
always
recommend
under
such
circumstances
master
sudall
and
indeed
adopt
myself
and
i
am
sure
you
will
approve
of
harkee
bess
when
you
have
ministered
to
poor
baldwyn
wants
i
must
crave
your
attention
to
my
own
and
beg
you
to
fill
me
a
tankard
with
your
oldest
ale
and
toast
me
an
oatcake
to
eat
with
i
must
keep
up
my
spirits
worthy
sir
he
added
to
roger
nowell
for
i
have
a
painful
duty
to
perform
i
do
not
know
when
i
have
been
more
shocked
than
by
the
death
of
poor
mary
baldwyn
a
fair
flower
and
early
nipped
nipped
indeed
if
all
we
have
heard
be
correct
rejoined
newell
the
forest
is
in
a
sad
state
reverend
sir
it
would
seem
as
if
the
enemy
of
mankind
by
means
of
his
abominable
agents
were
permitted
to
exercise
uncontrolled
dominion
over
it
i
must
needs
say
the
forlorn
condition
of
the
people
reflects
little
credit
on
those
who
have
them
in
charge
the
powers
of
darkness
could
never
have
prevailed
to
such
an
extent
if
duly
resisted
i
lament
to
hear
you
say
so
good
master
nowell
replied
the
rector
i
have
done
my
best
i
assure
you
to
keep
my
small
and
flock
together
and
to
save
them
from
the
ravening
wolves
and
cunning
foxes
that
infest
the
country
and
if
now
and
then
some
sheep
have
gone
astray
or
a
poor
lamb
as
in
the
instance
of
mary
baldwyn
hath
fallen
a
victim
i
am
scarcely
to
blame
for
the
mischance
rather
let
me
say
sir
that
you
as
an
active
and
zealous
magistrate
should
take
the
matter
in
hand
and
by
severe
dealing
with
the
offenders
arrest
the
progress
of
the
evil
no
defence
spiritual
or
otherwise
as
yet
set
up
against
them
has
proved
effectual
justly
remarked
reverend
sir
observed
potts
looking
up
from
the
memorandum
book
in
which
he
was
writing
and
i
am
sure
your
advice
will
not
be
lost
upon
master
roger
nowell
as
regards
the
persons
who
may
be
afflicted
by
witchcraft
hath
not
our
sagacious
monarch
observed
that
are
three
kind
of
folks
who
may
be
tempted
or
troubled
the
wicked
for
their
horrible
sins
to
punish
them
in
the
like
measure
the
godly
that
are
sleeping
in
any
great
sins
or
infirmities
and
weakness
in
faith
to
waken
them
up
the
faster
by
such
an
uncouth
form
and
even
some
of
the
best
that
their
patience
may
be
tried
before
the
world
as
job
was
tried
for
why
may
not
god
use
any
kind
of
extraordinary
punishment
when
it
pleases
him
as
well
as
the
ordinary
rods
of
sickness
or
other
adversities
very
true
sir
replied
holden
and
we
are
undergoing
this
severe
trial
now
fortunate
are
they
who
profit
by
it
hear
what
is
said
further
sir
by
the
king
pursued
potts
man
declares
that
wise
prince
to
presume
so
far
as
to
promise
any
impunity
to
himself
but
further
on
he
gives
us
courage
for
he
adds
yet
we
ought
not
to
be
afraid
for
that
of
any
thing
that
the
devil
and
his
wicked
instruments
can
do
against
us
for
we
daily
fight
against
him
in
a
hundred
other
ways
and
therefore
as
a
valiant
captain
affrays
no
more
being
at
the
combat
nor
stays
from
his
purpose
for
the
rummishing
shot
of
a
cannon
nor
the
small
clack
of
a
pistolet
not
being
certain
what
may
light
on
him
even
so
ought
we
boldly
to
go
forward
in
fighting
against
the
devil
without
any
greater
terror
for
these
his
rarest
weapons
than
the
ordinary
whereof
we
have
daily
the
proof
his
majesty
is
quite
right
observed
holden
and
i
am
glad
to
hear
his
convincing
words
so
judiciously
cited
i
myself
have
no
fear
of
these
wicked
instruments
of
satan
in
what
manner
may
i
ask
have
you
proved
your
courage
sir
inquired
roger
nowell
have
you
preached
against
them
and
denounced
their
wickedness
menacing
them
with
the
thunders
of
the
church
i
can
not
say
i
have
replied
holden
rather
abashed
but
i
shall
henceforth
adopt
a
very
different
ah
here
comes
the
ale
he
added
taking
the
foaming
tankard
from
bess
this
is
the
best
cordial
wherewith
to
sustain
one
courage
in
these
trying
times
some
remedy
must
be
found
for
this
intolerable
grievance
observed
roger
nowell
after
a
few
moments
reflection
till
this
morning
i
was
not
aware
of
the
extent
of
the
evil
but
supposed
that
the
two
malignant
hags
who
seem
to
reign
supreme
here
confined
their
operations
to
blighting
corn
maiming
cattle
turning
milk
sour
and
even
these
reports
i
fancied
were
greatly
exaggerated
but
i
now
find
from
what
i
have
seen
at
sabden
and
elsewhere
that
they
fall
very
far
short
of
the
reality
it
would
be
difficult
to
increase
the
darkness
of
the
picture
said
the
chirurgeon
but
what
remedy
will
you
apply
the
cautery
sir
replied
potts
the
actual
cautery
we
will
burn
out
this
the
two
old
hags
and
their
noxious
brood
shall
be
brought
to
the
stake
that
will
effect
a
radical
cure
it
may
when
it
is
accomplished
but
i
fear
it
will
be
long
ere
that
happens
replied
the
chirurgeon
shaking
his
head
doubtfully
are
you
acquainted
with
mother
demdike
history
sir
he
added
to
potts
in
part
replied
the
attorney
but
i
shall
be
glad
to
hear
any
thing
you
may
have
to
bring
forward
on
the
subject
the
peculiarity
in
her
case
observed
sudall
and
the
circumstance
distinguishing
her
dark
and
dread
career
from
that
of
all
other
witches
is
that
it
has
been
shaped
out
by
destiny
when
an
infant
a
malediction
was
pronounced
upon
her
head
by
the
unfortunate
abbot
paslew
she
is
also
the
offspring
of
a
man
reputed
to
have
bartered
his
soul
to
the
enemy
of
mankind
while
her
mother
was
a
witch
both
parents
perished
lamentably
about
the
time
of
paslew
execution
at
whalley
it
is
a
pity
their
miserable
infant
did
not
perish
with
them
observed
holden
how
much
crime
and
misery
would
have
been
spared
it
was
otherwise
ordained
replied
sudall
bereft
of
her
parents
in
this
way
the
infant
was
taken
charge
of
and
reared
by
dame
croft
the
miller
wife
of
whalley
but
even
in
those
early
days
she
exhibited
such
a
malicious
and
vindictive
disposition
and
became
so
unmanageable
that
the
good
dame
was
glad
to
get
rid
of
her
and
sent
her
into
the
forest
where
she
found
a
home
at
rough
lee
then
occupied
by
miles
nutter
the
grandfather
of
the
late
richard
nutter
aha
exclaimed
potts
was
mother
demdike
so
early
connected
with
that
family
i
must
make
a
note
of
that
circumstance
she
remained
at
rough
lee
for
some
years
returned
sudall
and
though
accounted
of
an
ill
disposition
there
was
nothing
to
be
alleged
against
her
at
the
time
though
afterwards
it
was
said
that
some
mishaps
that
befell
the
neighbours
were
owing
to
her
agency
and
that
she
was
always
attended
by
a
familiar
in
the
form
of
a
rat
or
a
mole
whether
this
were
so
or
not
i
can
not
say
but
it
is
certain
that
she
helped
miles
nutter
to
get
rid
of
his
wife
and
procured
him
a
second
spouse
in
return
for
which
services
he
bestowed
upon
her
an
old
ruined
tower
on
his
domains
you
mean
malkin
tower
said
nicholas
ay
malkin
tower
replied
the
chirurgeon
there
is
a
legend
connected
with
that
structure
which
i
will
relate
to
you
anon
if
you
desire
it
but
to
proceed
scarcely
had
bess
demdike
taken
up
her
abode
in
this
lone
tower
than
it
began
to
be
rumoured
that
she
was
a
witch
and
attended
sabbaths
on
the
summit
of
pendle
hill
and
on
rimington
moor
few
would
consort
with
her
and
invariably
attended
those
with
whom
she
quarrelled
though
of
hideous
and
forbidding
aspect
and
with
one
eye
lower
set
than
the
other
she
had
subtlety
enough
to
induce
a
young
man
named
sothernes
to
marry
her
and
two
children
a
son
and
a
daughter
were
the
fruit
of
the
union
the
daughter
i
have
seen
at
whalley
observed
potts
but
i
have
never
encountered
the
son
christopher
demdike
still
lives
i
believe
replied
the
chirurgeon
though
what
has
become
of
him
i
know
not
for
he
has
quitted
these
parts
he
is
as
as
his
mother
and
has
the
same
strange
and
fearful
look
about
the
eyes
i
shall
recognise
him
if
i
see
him
observed
potts
you
are
scarcely
likely
to
meet
him
returned
sudall
for
as
i
have
said
he
has
left
the
forest
but
to
return
to
my
story
the
marriage
state
was
little
suitable
to
bess
demdike
and
in
five
years
she
contrived
to
free
herself
from
her
husband
restraint
and
ruled
alone
in
the
tower
her
malignant
influence
now
began
to
be
felt
throughout
the
whole
district
and
by
dint
of
menaces
and
positive
acts
of
mischief
she
extorted
all
she
required
whosoever
refused
her
requests
speedily
experienced
her
resentment
when
she
was
in
the
fulness
of
her
power
a
rival
sprang
up
in
the
person
of
anne
whittle
since
known
by
the
name
of
chattox
which
she
obtained
in
marriage
and
this
woman
disputed
bess
demdike
supremacy
each
strove
to
injure
the
adherents
of
her
rival
and
terrible
was
the
mischief
they
wrought
in
the
end
however
mother
demdike
got
the
upper
hand
years
have
flown
over
the
old
hag
head
and
her
guilty
career
has
been
hitherto
attended
with
impunity
plans
have
been
formed
to
bring
her
to
justice
but
they
have
ever
failed
and
so
in
the
case
of
old
chattox
her
career
has
been
as
baneful
and
as
successful
as
that
of
mother
demdike
but
their
course
is
wellnigh
run
said
potts
and
the
time
is
come
for
the
extirpation
of
the
old
serpents
ah
who
is
that
at
the
window
cried
sudall
but
that
you
are
sitting
near
me
i
should
declare
you
were
looking
in
at
us
it
must
be
master

brother
the
reeve
of
the
forest
observed
nicholas
with
a
laugh
heed
him
not
cried
the
attorney
angrily
but
let
us
have
the
promised
legend
of
malkin
tower
willingly
replied
the
chirurgeon
but
before
i
begin
i
must
recruit
myself
with
a
can
of
ale
the
flagon
being
set
before
him
sudall
commenced
his
story
the
legend
of
malkin
tower
on
the
brow
of
a
high
hill
forming
part
of
the
range
of
pendle
and
commanding
an
extensive
view
over
the
forest
and
the
wild
and
mountainous
region
around
it
stands
a
stern
solitary
tower
old
as
the
and
built
as
a
stronghold
by
wulstan
a
northumbrian
thane
in
the
time
of
edmund
or
edred
it
is
circular
in
form
and
very
lofty
and
serves
as
a
landmark
to
the
country
round
placed
high
up
in
the
building
the
door
was
formerly
reached
by
a
steep
flight
of
stone
steps
but
these
were
removed
some
fifty
or
sixty
years
ago
by
mother
demdike
and
a
ladder
capable
of
being
raised
or
let
down
at
pleasure
substituted
for
them
affording
the
only
apparent
means
of
entrance
the
tower
is
otherwise
inaccessible
the
walls
being
of
immense
thickness
with
no
window
lower
than
feet
from
the
ground
though
it
is
thought
there
must
be
a
secret
outlet
for
the
old
witch
when
she
wants
to
come
forth
does
not
wait
for
the
ladder
to
be
let
down
but
this
may
be
otherwise
explained
internally
there
are
three
floors
the
lowest
being
placed
on
a
level
with
the
door
and
this
is
the
apartment
chiefly
occupied
by
the
hag
in
the
centre
of
this
room
is
a
trapdoor
opening
upon
a
deep
vault
which
forms
the
basement
story
of
the
structure
and
which
was
once
used
as
a
dungeon
but
is
now
tenanted
it
is
said
by
a
fiend
who
can
be
summoned
by
the
witch
on
stamping
her
foot
round
the
room
runs
a
gallery
contrived
in
the
thickness
of
the
walls
while
the
upper
chambers
are
gained
by
a
secret
staircase
and
closed
by
movable
stones
the
machinery
of
which
is
only
known
to
the
inmate
of
the
tower
all
the
rooms
are
lighted
by
narrow
loopholes
thus
you
will
see
that
the
fortress
is
still
capable
of
sustaining
a
siege
and
old
demdike
has
been
heard
to
declare
that
she
would
hold
it
for
a
month
against
a
hundred
men
hitherto
it
has
proved
impregnable
on
the
norman
invasion
malkin
tower
was
held
by
ughtred
a
descendant
of
wulstan
who
kept
possession
of
pendle
forest
and
the
hills
around
it
and
successfully
resisted
the
aggressions
of
the
conquerors
his
enemies
affirmed
he
was
assisted
by
a
demon
whom
he
had
propitiated
by
some
fearful
sacrifice
made
in
the
tower
and
the
notion
seemed
borne
out
by
the
success
uniformly
attending
his
conflicts
prowess
was
stained
by
cruelty
and
rapine
merciless
in
the
treatment
of
his
captives
putting
them
to
death
by
horrible
tortures
or
immuring
them
in
the
dark
and
noisome
dungeon
of
his
tower
he
would
hold
his
revels
over
their
heads
and
deride
their
groans
heaps
of
treasure
obtained
by
pillage
were
secured
by
him
in
the
tower
from
his
frequent
acts
of
treachery
and
the
many
foul
murders
he
perpetrated
ughtred
was
styled
the
of
the
normans
for
a
long
period
he
enjoyed
complete
immunity
from
punishment
but
after
the
siege
of
york
and
the
defeat
of
the
insurgents
his
destruction
was
vowed
by
ilbert
de
lacy
lord
of
blackburnshire
and
this
fierce
chieftain
set
fire
to
part
of
the
forest
in
which
the
saxon
thane
and
his
followers
were
concealed
drove
them
to
malkin
tower
took
it
after
an
obstinate
and
prolonged
defence
and
considerable
loss
to
himself
and
put
them
all
to
the
sword
except
the
leader
whom
he
hanged
from
the
top
of
his
own
fortress
in
the
dungeon
were
found
many
carcasses
and
the
greater
part
of
ughtred
treasure
served
to
enrich
the
victor
once
again
in
the
reign
of
henry
malkin
tower
became
a
robber
stronghold
and
gave
protection
to
a
freebooter
named
blackburn
who
with
a
band
of
daring
and
desperate
marauders
took
advantage
of
the
troubled
state
of
the
country
ravaged
it
far
and
wide
and
committed
unheard
of
atrocities
even
levying
contributions
upon
the
abbeys
of
whalley
and
salley
and
the
heads
of
these
religious
establishments
were
glad
to
make
terms
with
him
to
save
their
herds
and
stores
the
rather
that
all
attempts
to
dislodge
him
from
his
mountain
fastness
and
destroy
his
band
had
failed
blackburn
seemed
to
enjoy
the
same
kind
of
protection
as
ughtred
and
practised
the
same
atrocities
torturing
and
imprisoning
his
captives
unless
they
were
heavily
ransomed
he
also
led
a
life
of
wildest
licence
and
when
not
engaged
in
some
predatory
exploit
spent
his
time
in
carousing
with
his
followers
upon
one
occasion
it
chanced
that
he
made
a
visit
in
disguise
to
whalley
abbey
and
passing
the
little
hermitage
near
the
church
beheld
the
votaress
who
tenanted
it
this
was
isole
de
heton
ravished
by
her
wondrous
beauty
blackburn
soon
found
an
opportunity
of
making
his
passion
known
to
her
and
his
handsome
though
fierce
lineaments
pleasing
her
he
did
not
long
sigh
in
vain
he
frequently
visited
her
in
the
garb
of
a
cistertian
monk
and
being
taken
for
one
of
the
brethren
his
conduct
brought
great
scandal
upon
the
abbey
the
abandoned
votaress
bore
him
a
daughter
and
the
infant
was
conveyed
away
by
the
lover
and
placed
under
the
care
of
a
peasant
wife
at
barrowford
from
that
child
sprung
bess
blackburn
the
mother
of
old
demdike
so
that
the
witch
is
a
direct
descendant
of
isole
de
heton
notwithstanding
all
precautions
isole
dark
offence
became
known
and
she
would
have
paid
the
penalty
of
it
at
the
stake
if
she
had
not
fled
in
scaling
whalley
nab
in
the
woody
heights
of
which
she
was
to
remain
concealed
till
her
lover
could
come
to
her
she
fell
from
a
rock
shattering
her
limbs
and
disfiguring
her
features
some
say
she
was
lamed
for
life
and
became
as
hideous
as
she
had
heretofore
been
lovely
but
this
is
erroneous
for
apprehensive
of
such
a
result
attended
by
the
loss
of
her
lover
she
invoked
the
powers
of
darkness
and
proffered
her
soul
in
return
for
five
years
of
unimpaired
beauty
the
compact
was
made
and
when
blackburn
came
he
found
her
more
beautiful
than
ever
enraptured
he
conveyed
her
to
malkin
tower
and
lived
with
her
there
in
security
laughing
to
scorn
the
menaces
of
abbot
eccles
by
whom
he
was
excommunicated
time
went
on
and
as
isole
charms
underwent
no
change
her
lover
ardour
continued
unabated
five
years
passed
in
guilty
pleasures
and
the
last
day
of
the
allotted
term
arrived
no
change
was
manifest
in
isole
demeanour
neither
remorse
nor
fear
were
exhibited
by
her
never
had
she
appeared
more
lovely
never
in
higher
or
more
exuberant
spirits
she
besought
her
lover
who
was
still
madly
intoxicated
by
her
infernal
charms
to
give
a
banquet
that
night
to
ten
of
his
trustiest
followers
he
willingly
assented
and
bade
them
to
the
feast
they
ate
and
drank
merrily
and
the
gayest
of
the
company
was
the
lovely
isole
her
spirits
seemed
somewhat
too
wild
even
to
blackburn
but
he
did
not
check
her
though
surprised
at
the
excessive
liveliness
and
freedom
of
her
sallies
her
eyes
flashed
like
fire
and
there
was
not
a
man
present
but
was
madly
in
love
with
her
and
ready
to
dispute
for
her
smiles
with
his
captain
the
wine
flowed
freely
and
song
and
jest
went
on
till
midnight
when
the
hour
struck
isole
filled
a
cup
to
the
brim
and
called
upon
them
to
pledge
her
all
arose
and
drained
their
goblets
enthusiastically
was
a
farewell
cup
she
said
am
going
away
with
one
of
you
exclaimed
blackburn
in
angry
surprise
any
one
but
touch
your
hand
and
i
will
strike
him
dead
at
my
feet
the
rest
of
the
company
regarded
each
other
with
surprise
and
it
was
then
discovered
that
a
stranger
was
amongst
them
a
tall
dark
man
whose
looks
were
so
terrible
and
demoniacal
that
no
one
dared
lay
hands
upon
him
am
come
he
said
with
fearful
significance
to
isole
i
am
ready
she
answered
boldly
will
go
with
you
were
it
to
the
bottomless
pit
cried
blackburn
catching
hold
of
her
is
thither
i
am
going
she
answered
with
a
scream
of
laughter
shall
be
glad
of
a
companion
when
the
paroxysm
of
laughter
was
over
she
fell
down
on
the
floor
her
lover
would
have
raised
her
when
what
was
his
horror
to
find
that
he
held
in
his
arms
an
old
woman
with
frightfully
disfigured
features
and
evidently
in
the
agonies
of
death
she
fixed
one
look
upon
him
and
expired
terrified
by
the
occurrence
the
guests
hurried
away
and
when
they
returned
next
day
they
found
blackburn
stretched
on
the
floor
and
quite
dead
they
cast
his
body
together
with
that
of
the
wretched
isole
into
the
vault
beneath
the
room
where
they
were
lying
and
then
taking
possession
of
his
treasure
removed
to
some
other
retreat
thenceforth
malkin
tower
became
haunted
though
wholly
deserted
lights
were
constantly
seen
shining
from
it
at
night
and
sounds
of
wild
revelry
succeeded
by
shrieks
and
groans
issued
from
it
the
figure
of
isole
was
often
seen
to
come
forth
and
flit
across
the
wastes
in
the
direction
of
whalley
abbey
on
stormy
nights
a
huge
black
cat
with
flaming
eyes
was
frequently
descried
on
the
summit
of
the
structure
whence
it
obtained
its
name
of
grimalkin
or
malkin
tower
the
pile
ultimately
came
into
the
possession
of
the
nutter
family
but
it
was
never
tenanted
until
assigned
as
i
have
already
mentioned
to
mother
demdike
the
chirurgeon
marvellous
story
was
listened
to
with
great
attention
by
his
auditors
most
of
them
were
familiar
with
different
versions
of
it
but
to
master
potts
it
was
altogether
new
and
he
made
rapid
notes
of
it
questioning
the
narrator
as
to
one
or
two
points
which
appeared
to
him
to
require
explanation
nicholas
as
may
be
supposed
was
particularly
interested
in
that
part
of
the
legend
which
referred
to
isole
de
heton
he
now
for
the
first
time
heard
of
her
unhallowed
intercourse
with
the
freebooter
blackburn
of
her
compact
on
whalley
nab
with
the
fiend
of
her
mysterious
connection
with
malkin
tower
and
of
her
being
the
ancestress
of
mother
demdike
the
consideration
of
all
these
points
coupled
with
a
vivid
recollection
of
his
own
strange
adventure
with
the
impious
votaress
at
the
abbey
on
the
previous
night
plunged
him
into
a
deep
train
of
thought
and
he
began
seriously
to
consider
whether
he
might
not
have
committed
some
heinous
sin
and
indeed
jeopardised
his
soul
welfare
by
dancing
with
her
what
if
i
should
share
the
same
fate
as
the
robber
blackburn
he
ruminated
and
be
dragged
to
perdition
by
her
it
is
a
very
awful
reflection
but
though
my
fate
might
operate
as
a
warning
to
others
i
am
by
no
means
anxious
to
be
held
up
as
a
moral
scarecrow
rather
let
me
take
warning
myself
amend
my
life
abandon
intemperance
which
leads
to
all
manner
of
wickedness
and
suffer
myself
no
more
to
be
ensnared
by
the
wiles
and
delusions
of
the
tempter
in
the
form
of
a
fair
woman
no
no
i
will
alter
and
amend
my
life
i
regret
however
to
say
that
these
praiseworthy
resolutions
were
but
transient
and
that
the
squire
quite
forgetting
that
the
work
of
reform
if
intended
to
be
really
accomplished
ought
to
commence
at
once
and
by
no
means
be
postponed
till
the
morrow
yielded
to
the
seductions
of
a
fresh
pottle
of
sack
which
was
presented
to
him
at
the
moment
by
bess
and
in
taking
it
could
not
help
squeezing
the
hand
of
the
bouncing
hostess
and
gazing
at
her
more
tenderly
than
became
a
married
man
oh
nicholas
nicholas
the
work
of
reform
i
am
afraid
proceeds
very
slowly
and
imperfectly
with
you
your
friend
parson
dewhurst
would
have
told
you
that
it
is
much
easier
to
form
good
resolutions
than
to
keep
them
leaving
the
squire
however
to
his
cogitations
and
his
sack
the
attorney
to
his
in
which
he
was
still
engaged
in
writing
and
the
others
to
their
talk
we
shall
proceed
to
the
chamber
whither
the
poor
miller
had
been
led
by
bess
when
visited
by
the
rector
he
had
been
apparently
soothed
by
the
worthy
man
consolatory
advice
but
when
left
alone
he
speedily
relapsed
into
his
former
dark
and
gloomy
state
of
mind
he
did
not
notice
bess
who
according
to
holden
directions
placed
the
aquavitæ
bottle
before
him
but
as
long
as
she
stayed
remained
with
his
face
buried
in
his
hands
as
soon
as
she
was
gone
he
arose
and
began
to
pace
the
room
to
and
fro
the
window
was
open
and
he
could
hear
the
funeral
bell
tolling
mournfully
at
intervals
each
recurrence
of
the
dismal
sound
added
sharpness
and
intensity
to
his
grief
his
sufferings
became
almost
intolerable
and
drove
him
to
the
very
verge
of
despair
and
madness
if
a
weapon
had
been
at
hand
he
might
have
seized
it
and
put
a
sudden
period
to
his
existence
his
breast
was
a
chaos
of
fierce
and
troubled
thoughts
in
which
one
black
and
terrible
idea
arose
and
overpowered
all
the
rest
it
was
the
desire
of
vengeance
deep
and
complete
upon
her
whom
he
looked
upon
as
the
murderess
of
his
child
he
cared
not
how
it
were
accomplished
so
it
were
done
but
such
was
the
opinion
he
entertained
of
the
old
hag
power
that
he
doubted
his
ability
to
the
task
still
as
the
bell
tolled
on
the
furies
at
his
heart
lashed
and
goaded
him
on
and
yelled
in
his
ear
revenge
revenge
now
indeed
he
was
crazed
with
grief
and
rage
he
tore
off
handfuls
of
hair
plunged
his
nails
deeply
into
his
breast
and
while
committing
these
and
other
wild
excesses
with
frantic
imprecations
he
called
down
heaven
judgments
on
his
own
head
he
was
in
that
lost
and
helpless
state
when
the
enemy
of
mankind
has
power
over
man
nor
was
the
opportunity
neglected
for
when
the
wretched
baldwyn
who
exhausted
by
the
violence
of
his
motions
had
leaned
for
a
moment
against
the
wall
he
perceived
to
his
surprise
that
there
was
a
man
in
the
room
a
small
personage
attired
in
rusty
black
whom
he
thought
had
been
one
of
the
party
in
the
adjoining
chamber
there
was
an
expression
of
mockery
about
this
person
countenance
which
did
not
please
the
miller
and
he
asked
him
sternly
what
he
wanted

said
fiercely

raised

man

he
instantly
dropped
it
appalled
by
a
look
which
the

replied
the
other
with
the
same
mocking
smile
but
you
are
mistaken
in
supposing
that
you
have
spoken
to
me
before
he
with
whom
you
conversed
in
the
other
room
resembles
me
in
more
respects
than

but
he
does
not
possess

to

she

escape
all
the
snares
laid

but
she

cried
the
miller
his
hair
erecting
on
his
head
and
cold
damps
breaking
out
upon
his
brow

fashion

as

of

that

enough
would

murtheress
of
your
child

baldwyn
and
you
are
willing
to
pay
for
it
at
the
price
of
your
soul
demanded
the
other
advancing
towards
him
baldwyn
reeled
he
saw
at
once
the
fearful
peril
in
which
he
was
placed
and
averted
his
gaze
from
the
scorching
glance
of
the
reeve
at
this
moment
the
door
was
tried
without
and
the
voice
of
bess
was
heard
saying
who
ha
yo
got
wi
yo
ruchot
and
whoy
ha
yo
fastened
t

your

demanded
the
reeve

the
miller
agreed
replied
the
other
i
will
be
with
you
after
the
funeral
and
he
sprang
through
the
window
and
disappeared
before
baldwyn
could
open
the
door
and
admit
bess
chapter
the
perambulation
of
the
boundaries
the
lane
along
which
richard
assheton
galloped
in
pursuit
of
mother
chattox
made
so
many
turns
and
was
moreover
so
completely
hemmed
in
by
high
banks
and
hedges
that
he
could
sec
nothing
on
either
side
of
him
and
very
little
in
advance
but
guided
by
the
clatter
of
hoofs
he
urged
merlin
to
his
utmost
speed
fancying
he
should
soon
come
up
with
the
fugitives
in
this
however
he
was
deceived
the
sound
that
had
led
him
on
became
fainter
and
fainter
till
at
last
it
died
away
altogether
and
on
quitting
the
lane
and
gaining
the
moor
where
the
view
was
wholly
uninterrupted
no
traces
either
of
witch
or
reeve
could
be
discerned
with
a
feeling
of
angry
disappointment
richard
was
about
to
turn
back
when
a
large
black
greyhound
came
from
out
an
adjoining
clough
and
made
towards
him
the
singularity
of
the
circumstance
induced
him
to
halt
and
regard
the
dog
with
attention
on
nearing
him
the
animal
looked
wistfully
in
his
face
and
seemed
to
invite
him
to
follow
and
the
young
man
was
so
struck
by
the
dog
manner
that
he
complied
and
had
not
gone
far
when
a
hare
of
unusual
size
and
grey
with
age
bounded
from
beneath
a
and
speeded
away
the
greyhound
starting
in
pursuit
aware
of
the
prevailing
notion
that
a
witch
most
commonly
assumed
such
a
form
when
desirous
of
escaping
or
performing
some
act
of
mischief
such
as
drying
the
milk
of
kine
richard
at
once
came
to
the
conclusion
that
the
hare
could
be
no
other
than
mother
chattox
and
without
pausing
to
inquire
what
the
hound
could
be
or
why
it
should
appear
at
such
a
singular
and
apparently
fortunate
juncture
he
at
once
joined
the
run
and
cheered
on
the
dog
with
whoop
and
holloa
old
as
it
was
apparently
the
hare
ran
with
extraordinary
swiftness
clearing
every
stone
wall
and
other
impediment
in
the
way
and
more
than
once
cunningly
doubling
upon
its
pursuers
but
every
feint
and
stratagem
were
defeated
by
the
fleet
and
sagacious
hound
and
the
hunted
animal
at
length
took
to
the
open
waste
where
the
run
became
so
rapid
that
richard
had
enough
to
do
to
keep
up
with
it
though
merlin
almost
as
furiously
excited
as
his
master
strained
every
sinew
to
the
task
in
this
way
the
chasers
and
the
chased
scoured
the
dark
and
heathy
plain
skirting
and
clearing
dyke
till
they
almost
reached
the
of
pendle
hill
which
rose
like
an
impassable
barrier
before
them
hitherto
the
chances
had
seemed
in
favour
of
the
hare
but
they
now
began
to
turn
and
as
it
seemed
certain
she
must
fall
into
the
hound
jaws
richard
expected
every
moment
to
find
her
resume
her
natural
form
the
run
having
brought
him
within
a
quarter
of
a
mile
of
barley
the
rude
hovels
composing
which
little
booth
were
clearly
discernible
the
young
man
began
to
think
the
hag
dwelling
must
he
among
them
and
that
she
was
hurrying
thither
as
to
a
place
of
refuge
but
before
this
could
be
accomplished
he
hoped
to
effect
her
capture
and
once
more
cheered
on
the
hound
and
plunged
his
spurs
into
sides
an
obstacle
however
occurred
which
he
had
not
counted
on
directly
in
the
course
taken
by
the
hare
lay
a
deep
disused
limestone
quarry
completely
screened
from
view
by
a
fringe
of
brushwood
when
within
a
few
yards
of
this
pit
the
hound
made
a
dash
at
the
flying
hare
but
eluding
him
the
latter
sprang
forward
and
both
went
over
the
edge
of
the
quarry
together
richard
had
wellnigh
followed
and
in
that
case
would
have
been
inevitably
dashed
in
pieces
but
discovering
the
danger
ere
it
was
too
late
by
a
powerful
effort
which
threw
merlin
upon
his
haunches
he
pulled
him
back
on
the
very
brink
of
the
pit
the
young
man
shuddered
as
he
gazed
into
the
depths
of
the
quarry
and
saw
the
jagged
points
and
heaps
of
broken
stone
that
would
have
received
him
but
he
looked
in
vain
for
the
old
witch
whose
mangled
body
together
with
that
of
the
hound
he
expected
to
behold
and
he
then
asked
himself
whether
the
chase
might
not
have
been
a
snare
set
for
him
by
the
hag
and
her
familiar
with
the
intent
of
luring
him
to
destruction
if
so
he
had
been
providentially
preserved
quitting
the
pit
his
first
idea
was
to
proceed
to
barley
which
was
now
only
a
few
hundred
yards
off
to
make
inquiries
respecting
mother
chattox
and
ascertain
whether
she
really
dwelt
there
but
on
further
consideration
he
judged
it
best
to
return
without
further
delay
to
goldshaw
lest
his
friends
ignorant
as
to
what
had
befallen
him
might
become
alarmed
on
his
account
but
he
resolved
as
soon
as
he
had
disposed
of
the
business
in
hand
to
prosecute
his
search
after
the
hag
riding
rapidly
he
soon
cleared
the
ground
between
the
quarry
and
goldshaw
lane
and
was
about
to
enter
the
latter
when
the
sound
of
voices
singing
a
funeral
hymn
caught
his
ear
and
pausing
to
listen
to
it
he
beheld
a
little
procession
the
meaning
of
which
he
readily
comprehended
wending
its
slow
and
melancholy
way
in
the
same
direction
as
himself
it
was
headed
by
four
men
in
deep
mourning
bearing
upon
their
shoulders
a
small
coffin
covered
with
a
pall
and
having
a
garland
of
white
flowers
in
front
of
it
behind
them
followed
about
a
dozen
young
men
and
maidens
likewise
in
mourning
walking
two
and
two
with
gait
and
aspect
of
unfeigned
affliction
many
of
the
women
though
merely
rustics
seemed
to
possess
considerable
personal
attraction
but
their
features
were
in
a
great
measure
concealed
by
their
large
white
kerchiefs
disposed
in
the
form
of
hoods
all
carried
sprigs
of
rosemary
and
bunches
of
flowers
in
their
hands
plaintive
was
the
hymn
they
sang
and
their
voices
though
untaught
were
sweet
and
touching
and
went
to
the
heart
of
the
listener
much
moved
richard
suffered
the
funeral
procession
to
precede
him
along
the
deep
and
devious
lane
and
as
it
winded
beneath
the
hedges
the
sight
was
inexpressibly
affecting
fastening
his
horse
to
a
tree
at
the
end
of
the
lane
richard
followed
on
foot
notice
of
the
approach
of
the
train
having
been
given
in
the
village
all
the
inhabitants
flocked
forth
to
meet
it
and
there
was
scarcely
a
dry
eye
among
them
arrived
within
a
short
distance
of
the
church
the
coffin
was
met
by
the
minister
attended
by
the
clerk
behind
whom
came
roger
nowell
nicholas
and
the
rest
of
the
company
from
the
hostel
with
great
difficulty
poor
baldwyn
could
be
brought
to
take
his
place
as
chief
mourner
these
arrangements
completed
the
body
of
the
girl
was
borne
into
the
churchyard
the
minister
reading
the
solemn
texts
appointed
for
the
occasion
and
leading
the
way
to
the
grave
beside
which
stood
the
sexton
together
with
the
beadle
of
goldshaw
and
sparshot
the
coffin
was
then
laid
on
trestles
and
amidst
profound
silence
broken
only
by
the
sobs
of
the
mourners
the
service
was
read
and
preparations
made
for
lowering
the
body
into
the
grave
then
it
was
that
poor
baldwyn
with
a
wild
cry
flung
himself
upon
the
shell
containing
all
that
remained
of
his
lost
treasure
and
could
with
difficulty
be
removed
from
it
by
bess
and
sudall
both
of
whom
were
in
attendance
the
bunches
of
flowers
and
sprigs
of
rosemary
having
been
laid
upon
the
coffin
by
the
maidens
amidst
loud
sobbing
and
audibly
expressed
lamentations
from
the
bystanders
it
was
let
down
into
the
grave
and
earth
thrown
over
it
earth
to
earth
ashes
to
ashes
dust
to
dust
the
ceremony
was
over
the
mourners
betook
themselves
to
the
little
hostel
and
the
spectators
slowly
dispersed
but
the
bereaved
father
still
lingered
unable
to
tear
himself
away
leaning
for
support
against
the
he
fiercely
bade
bess
who
would
have
led
him
home
with
her
begone
the
hostess
complied
in
appearance
but
remained
nigh
at
hand
though
concealed
from
view
once
more
the
dark
cloud
overshadowed
the
spirit
of
the
wretched
man
once
more
the
same
infernal
desire
of
vengeance
possessed
him
once
more
he
subjected
himself
to
temptation
striding
to
the
foot
of
the
grave
he
raised
his
hand
and
with
terrible
imprecations
vowed
to
lay
the
murtheress
of
his
child
as
low
as
she
herself
was
now
laid
at
that
moment
he
felt
an
eye
like
a
fixed
upon
him
and
looking
up
beheld
the
reeve
of
the
forest
standing
on
the
further
side
of
the
grave
kneel
down
and
swear
to
be
mine
and
your
wish
shall
be
gratified
said
the
reeve
beside
himself
with
grief
and
rage
baldwyn
would
have
complied
but
he
was
arrested
by
a
powerful
grasp
fearing
he
was
about
to
commit
some
rash
act

rushed
forward
and
caught
hold
of
his
doublet

in

tone
as
before

your
revenge
but
you
will
not
escape
me
and
he
turned
away
while
bess
almost
carried
the
trembling
and
enfeebled
miller
towards
the
hostel
roger
nowell
and
his
friends
had
only
waited
the
conclusion
of
the
funeral
to
set
forth
and
their
horses
being
in
readiness
they
mounted
them
on
leaving
the
churchyard
and
rode
slowly
along
the
lane
leading
towards
rough
lee
the
melancholy
scene
they
had
witnessed
and
the
afflicting
circumstances
connected
with
it
had
painfully
affected
the
party
and
little
conversation
occurred
until
they
were
overtaken
by
parson
holden
who
having
been
made
acquainted
with
their
errand
by
nicholas
was
desirous
of
accompanying
them
soon
after
this
also
the
reeve
of
the
forest
joined
them
and
on
seeing
him
richard
sternly
demanded
why
he
had
aided
mother
chattox
in
her
night
from
the
churchyard
and
what
had
become
of
her
you
are
entirely
mistaken
sir
replied
the
reeve
with
affected
astonishment
i
have
seen
nothing
whatever
of
the
old
hag
and
would
rather
lend
a
hand
to
her
capture
than
abet
her
flight
i
hold
all
witches
in
abhorrence
and
mother
chattox
especially
so
your
horse
looks
fresh
enough
certainly
said
richard
somewhat
shaken
in
his
suspicions
where
have
you
been
during
our
stay
at
goldshaw
you
did
not
put
up
at
the
hostel
i
went
to
farmer
johnson
replied
the
reeve
and
you
will
find
upon
inquiry
that
my
horse
has
not
been
out
of
his
stables
for
the
last
hour
i
myself
have
been
loitering
about
bess
grange
and
farmyard
as
your
grooms
will
testify
for
they
have
seen
me
humph
exclaimed
richard
i
suppose
i
must
credit
assertions
made
with
such
confidence
but
i
could
have
sworn
i
saw
you
ride
off
with
the
hag
behind
you
i
hope
i
shall
never
be
caught
in
such
bad
company
sir
replied
the
reeve
with
a
laugh
if
i
ride
off
with
any
one
it
shall
not
be
with
an
old
witch
depend
upon
it
though
by
no
means
satisfied
with
the
explanation
richard
was
forced
to
be
content
with
it
but
he
thought
he
would
address
a
few
more
questions
to
the
reeve
have
you
any
knowledge
he
said
when
the
boundaries
of
pendle
forest
were
first
settled
and
appointed
the
first
perambulation
was
made
by
henry
de
lacy
about
the
middle
of
the
twelfth
century
replied
the
reeve
pendle
forest
you
may
be
aware
sir
is
one
of
the
four
divisions
of
the
great
forest
of
blackburnshire
of
which
the
lacys
were
lords
the
three
other
divisions
being
accrington
trawden
and
rossendale
and
it
comprehends
an
extent
of
about
miles
part
of
which
you
have
traversed
at
a
later
period
namely
in
after
the
death
of
another
henry
de
lacy
earl
of
lincoln
the
last
of
his
line
and
one
of
the
bravest
of
edward
the
first
barons
an
inquisition
was
held
in
the
forest
and
it
was
subdivided
into
eleven
vaccaries
one
of
which
is
the
place
to
which
you
are
bound
rough
lee
the
learned
sir
edward
coke
defines
a
vaccary
to
signify
a
dairy
observed
potts
here
it
means
the
farm
and
land
as
well
replied
the
reeve
and
the
word
which
is
in
general
use
in
this
district
signifies
the
mansion
erected
upon
such
vaccary
mistress
nutter
residence
for
instance
being
nothing
more
than
the
booth
of
rough
lee
while
a
another
local
term
is
a
park
inclosed
within
the
forest
for
the
preservation
of
the
deer
and
the
convenience
of
the
chase
and
of
such
inclosures
we
have
two
namely
the
old
and
new
lawnd
by
a
commission
in
the
reign
of
henry
these
vaccaries
originally
granted
only
to
tenants
at
will
were
converted
into
copyholds
of
inheritance
but
and
here
is
a
legal
point
for
your
consideration
master
potts
as
it
seems
very
questionable
whether
titles
obtained
under
are
secure
not
unreasonable
fears
are
entertained
by
the
holders
of
the
lands
lest
they
should
be
seized
and
appropriated
by
the
crown
ah
ah
an
excellent
idea
master
reeve
exclaimed
potts
his
little
eyes
twinkling
with
pleasure
our
gracious
and
sagacious
monarch
would
grasp
at
the
suggestion
ay
and
grasp
at
the
lands
too
ha
ha
many
thanks
for
the
hint
good
reeve
i
will
not
fail
to
profit
by
it
if
their
titles
are
uncertain
the
landholders
would
be
glad
to
compromise
the
matter
with
the
crown
even
to
the
value
of
half
their
estates
rather
than
lose
the
whole
most
assuredly
they
would
replied
the
reeve
and
furthermore
they
would
pay
the
lawyer
well
who
could
manage
the
matter
adroitly
for
them
this
would
answer
your
purpose
better
than
hunting
up
witches
master
potts
one
pursuit
does
not
interfere
with
the
other
in
the
slightest
degree
worthy
reeve
observed
potts
i
can
not
consent
to
give
up
my
quest
of
the
witches
my
honour
is
concerned
in
their
extermination
but
to
turn
to
pendle
forest
the
greater
part
of
it
has
been
disafforested
i
presume
it
has
replied
the
other
and
we
are
now
in
one
of
the
purlieus
pourallee
is
the
better
word
most
excellent
reeve
said
potts
i
tell
you
thus
much
because
you
appear
to
be
a
man
of
learning
manwood
our
great
authority
in
such
matters
declares
a
pourallee
to
be
certain
territory
of
ground
adjoining
unto
the
forest
mered
and
bounded
with
immovable
marks
meres
and
boundaries
known
by
matter
of
record
only
and
as
it
applies
to
the
perambulation
we
are
about
to
make
i
may
as
well
repeat
what
the
same
learned
writer
further
saith
touching
marks
meres
and
boundaries
and
how
they
may
be
known
although
he
saith
forest
doth
lie
open
and
not
inclosed
with
hedge
ditch
pale
or
which
some
other
inclosures
have
yet
in
the
eye
and
consideration
of
the
law
the
same
hath
as
strong
an
inclosure
by
those
marks
meres
and
boundaries
as
if
there
were
a
brick
wall
to
encircle
the
same
marks
learned
reeve
are
deemed
unremovable
quia
omnes
metæ
forestæ
sunt
integræ
domino
and
those
who
take
them
away
are
punishable
for
the
trespass
at
the
assizes
of
the
forest
because
the
marks
are
things
that
can
not
be
stirred
as
rivers
highways
hills
and
the
like
now
such
unremoveable
marks
meres
and
boundaries
we
have
between
the
estate
of
my
excellent
client
master
roger
nowell
and
that
of
mistress
nutter
so
that
the
matter
at
issue
will
be
easily
decided
a
singular
smile
crossed
the
reeve
countenance
but
he
made
no
observation
unless
the
lady
can
turn
aside
streams
remove
hills
and
pluck
up
huge
trees
we
shall
win
pursued
potts
with
a
chuckle
again
the
reeve
smiled
but
he
forebore
to
speak
you
talk
of
marks
meres
and
boundaries
master
potts
remarked
richard
are
not
the
words
synonymous
not
precisely
so
sir
replied
the
attorney
there
is
a
slight
difference
in
their
signification
which
i
will
explain
to
you
the
words
of
the
statute
are
meras
et
now
or
mark
is
an
object
rising
from
the
ground
as
a
church
a
wall
or
a
tree
or
mere
is
the
space
or
interval
between
the
forest
and
the
land
adjoining
whereupon
the
mark
may
chance
to
stand
and
is
the
boundary
lying
on
a
level
with
the
forest
as
a
river
a
highway
a
pool
or
a
bog
i
comprehend
the
distinction
replied
richard
and
now
as
we
are
on
this
subject
he
added
to
the
reeve
i
would
gladly
know
the
precise
nature
of
your
office
my
duty
replied
the
other
is
to
range
daily
throughout
all
the
purlieus
or
pourallees
as
master
potts
more
properly
terms
them
and
disafforested
lands
and
inquire
into
all
trespasses
and
offences
against
vert
or
venison
and
present
them
at
the
king
next
court
of
attachment
or
swainmote
it
is
also
my
business
to
drive
into
the
forest
such
wild
beasts
as
have
strayed
from
it
to
attend
to
the
lawing
and
expeditation
of
mastiffs
and
to
raise
hue
and
cry
against
any
malefactors
or
trespassers
within
the
forest
i
will
give
you
the
exact
words
of
the
statute
said
potts
quis
viderit
malefactores
infra
metas
forestæ
debet
illos
capere
secundum
posse
suum
et
si
non
possit
debet
levare
hutesium
et
and
the
penalty
for
refusing
to
follow
hue
and
cry
is
heavy
fine
i
would
that
that
part
of
your
duty
relating
to
the
and
lawing
of
mastiffs
could
be
discontinued
said
richard
i
grieve
to
see
a
noble
animal
so
mutilated
in
bowland
forest
as
you
are
probably
aware
sir
rejoined
the
reeve
only
the
larger
mastiffs
are
lamed
a
small
stirrup
or
gauge
being
kept
by
the
master
forester
squire
robert
parker
of
browsholme
and
the
dog
whose
foot
will
pass
through
it
escapes
mutilation
the
practice
is
a
cruel
one
and
i
would
it
were
abolished
with
some
of
our
other
barbarous
forest
laws
observed
richard
while
this
conversation
had
been
going
on
the
party
had
proceeded
well
on
their
way
for
some
time
the
road
which
consisted
of
little
more
than
tracts
of
wheels
along
the
turf
led
along
a
plain
thrown
up
into
heathy
hillocks
and
then
passing
through
a
thicket
evidently
part
of
the
old
forest
it
brought
them
to
the
foot
of
a
hill
which
they
mounted
and
descended
into
another
valley
here
they
came
upon
pendle
water
and
while
skirting
its
banks
could
see
at
a
great
depth
below
the
river
rushing
over
its
rocky
bed
like
an
alpine
torrent
the
scenery
had
now
begun
to
assume
a
savage
and
sombre
character
the
deep
rift
through
which
the
river
ran
was
evidently
the
result
of
some
terrible
convulsion
of
the
earth
and
the
rocky
strata
were
strangely
and
fantastically
displayed
on
the
further
side
the
banks
rose
up
precipitously
consisting
for
the
most
part
of
bare
cliffs
though
now
and
then
a
tree
would
root
itself
in
some
crevice
below
this
the
stream
sank
over
a
wide
shelf
of
rock
in
a
broad
full
cascade
and
boiled
and
foamed
in
the
stony
basin
that
received
it
after
which
grown
less
impetuous
it
ran
tranquilly
on
for
a
couple
of
hundred
yards
and
was
then
artificially
restrained
by
a
dam
which
diverting
it
in
part
from
its
course
caused
it
to
turn
the
wheels
of
a
mill
here
was
the
abode
of
the
unfortunate
richard
baldwyn
and
here
had
blossomed
forth
the
fair
flower
so
untimely
gathered
an
air
of
gloom
hung
over
this
once
cheerful
spot
its
very
beauty
contributing
to
this
saddening
effect
the
flowed
swiftly
and
brightly
on
but
the
wheel
was
stopped
windows
and
doors
were
closed
and
death
kept
his
grim
holiday
undisturbed
no
one
was
to
be
seen
about
the
premises
nor
was
any
sound
heard
except
the
bark
of
the
lonely
many
a
sorrowing
glance
was
cast
at
this
forlorn
habitation
as
the
party
rode
past
it
and
many
a
sigh
was
heaved
for
the
poor
girl
who
had
so
lately
been
its
pride
and
ornament
but
if
any
one
had
noticed
the
bitter
sneer
curling
the
reeve
lip
or
caught
the
malignant
fire
gleaming
in
his
eye
it
would
scarcely
have
been
thought
that
he
shared
in
the
general
regret
after
the
cavalcade
had
passed
the
mill
one
or
two
other
cottages
appeared
on
the
near
side
of
the
river
while
the
opposite
banks
began
to
be
clothed
with
timber
the
glen
became
more
and
more
contracted
and
a
stone
bridge
crossed
the
stream
near
which
and
on
the
same
side
of
the
river
as
the
party
stood
a
cluster
of
cottages
constituting
the
little
village
of
rough
lee
on
reaching
the
bridge
mistress
nutter
habitation
came
in
view
and
it
was
pointed
out
by
nicholas
to
potts
who
contemplated
it
with
much
curiosity
in
his
eyes
it
seemed
exactly
adapted
to
its
owner
and
formed
to
hide
dark
and
guilty
deeds
it
was
a
stern
mansion
built
of
a
dark
grey
stone
with
tall
square
chimneys
and
windows
with
heavy
mullions
high
stone
walls
hoary
and
ran
round
the
gardens
and
courts
except
on
the
side
of
the
river
where
there
was
a
terrace
overlooking
the
stream
and
forming
a
pleasant
summer
walk
at
the
back
of
the
house
were
a
few
ancient
oaks
and
sycamores
and
in
the
gardens
were
some
old
clipped
yews
part
of
this
ancient
mansion
is
still
standing
and
retains
much
of
its
original
character
though
subdivided
and
tenanted
by
several
humble
families
the
garden
is
cut
up
into
paddocks
and
the
approach
environed
by
a
labyrinth
of
low
stone
walls
while
miserable
sheds
and
other
buildings
are
appended
to
it
the
terrace
is
wholly
obliterated
and
the
grange
and
offices
are
pulled
down
but
sufficient
is
still
left
of
the
place
to
give
an
idea
of
its
pristine
appearance
and
character
its
situation
is
striking
and
peculiar
in
front
rises
a
high
hill
forming
the
last
link
of
the
chain
of
pendle
and
looking
upon
barrowford
and
colne
on
the
further
side
of
which
and
therefore
not
discernible
from
the
mansion
stood
malkin
tower
at
the
period
in
question
the
lower
part
of
this
hill
was
well
wooded
and
washed
by
the
pendle
water
which
swept
past
it
through
banks
picturesque
and
beautiful
though
not
so
bold
and
rocky
as
those
in
the
neighbourhood
of
the
mill
in
the
rear
of
the
house
the
ground
gradually
rose
for
more
than
a
quarter
of
a
mile
when
it
obtained
a
considerable
elevation
following
the
course
of
the
stream
and
looking
down
the
gorge
another
hill
appeared
so
that
the
house
was
completely
shut
in
by
mountainous
acclivities
in
winter
when
the
snow
lay
on
the
heights
or
when
the
mists
hung
upon
them
for
weeks
together
or
descended
in
continuous
rain
rough
lee
was
sufficiently
desolate
and
seemed
cut
off
from
all
communication
with
the
outer
world
but
at
the
season
when
the
party
beheld
it
though
the
approaches
were
rugged
and
difficult
and
almost
inaccessible
except
to
the
horseman
or
pedestrian
bidding
defiance
to
any
vehicle
except
of
the
strongest
construction
still
the
place
was
not
without
a
certain
charm
mainly
however
derived
from
its
seclusion
the
scenery
was
stern
and
sombre
the
hills
were
dark
and
dreary
but
the
very
wildness
of
the
place
was
attractive
and
the
old
house
with
its
grey
walls
its
lofty
chimneys
its
gardens
with
their
clipped
yews
and
its
trees
harmonised
well
with
all
around
it
as
the
party
drew
near
the
house
the
gates
were
thrown
open
by
an
old
porter
with
two
other
servants
who
besought
them
to
stay
and
partake
of
some
refreshment
but
roger
nowell
haughtily
and
peremptorily
declined
the
invitation
and
rode
on
and
the
others
though
some
of
them
would
fain
have
complied
followed
him
scarcely
were
they
gone
than
james
device
who
had
been
in
the
garden
issued
from
the
gate
and
speeded
after
them
passing
through
a
close
at
the
back
of
the
mansion
and
tracking
a
short
narrow
lane
edged
by
stone
walls
the
party
which
had
received
some
accessions
from
the
cottages
of
rough
lee
as
well
as
from
the
huts
on
the
again
approached
the
river
and
proceeded
along
its
banks
the
being
all
of
them
tenants
of
nutter
and
acting
apparently
under
the
directions
of
james
device
who
had
now
joined
the
troop
stoutly
and
loudly
maintained
that
the
lady
would
be
found
right
in
the
inquiry
with
the
exception
of
one
old
man
named
henry
mitton
and
he
shook
his
head
gravely
when
appealed
to
by
jem
and
could
by
no
efforts
be
induced
to
join
him
in
the
clamour
notwithstanding
this
demonstration
roger
nowell
and
his
legal
adviser
were
both
very
sanguine
as
to
the
result
of
the
survey
being
in
their
favour
and
master
potts
turned
to
ascertain
from
sparshot
that
the
two
plans
which
had
been
rolled
up
and
consigned
to
his
custody
were
quite
safe
meanwhile
the
party
having
followed
the
course
of
pendle
water
through
the
glen
for
about
half
a
mile
during
which
they
kept
close
to
the
brawling
current
entered
a
little
thicket
and
then
striking
off
on
the
left
passed
over
the
foot
of
a
hill
and
came
to
the
edge
of
a
wide
moor
where
a
halt
was
called
by
nowell
it
being
now
announced
that
they
were
on
the
confines
of
the
disputed
property
preparations
were
immediately
made
for
the
survey
the
plans
were
taken
out
of
a
quiver
in
which
they
had
been
carefully
deposited
by
sparshot
and
handed
to
potts
who
giving
one
to
roger
nowell
and
the
other
to
nicholas
and
opening
his
declared
that
all
was
ready
and
the
two
leaders
rode
slowly
forward
while
the
rest
of
the
troop
followed
their
curiosity
being
stimulated
to
the
highest
pitch
presently
roger
nowell
again
stopped
and
pointed
to
a
woody
brake
we
are
now
come
he
said
to
a
wood
forming
part
of
my
property
and
which
from
an
eruption
caused
by
a
spring
that
took
place
in
it
many
years
ago
is
called
burst
clough
exactly
sir
exactly
cried
potts
burst
clough
i
have
it
here
landmarks
five
grey
stones
lying
apart
at
a
distance
of
one
hundred
yards
or
thereabouts
and
giving
you
sir
twenty
acres
of
moor
land
is
it
not
so
master
nicholas
the
marks
are
such
as
i
have
described
eh
they
are
sir
replied
the
squire
with
this
slight
difference
in
the
allotment
of
the
land
namely
that
mistress
nutter
claims
the
twenty
acres
while
she
assigns
you
only
ten
ten
devils
cried
roger
nowell
furiously
twenty
acres
are
mine
and
i
will
have
them
to
the
proof
then
rejoined
nicholas
the
first
of
the
grey
stones
is
here
and
the
second
on
the
left
in
that
hollow
said
roger
nowell
come
on
my
masters
come
on
ay
come
on
cried
nicholas
this
perambulation
will
be
rare
sport
who
wins
for
a
piece
of
gold
cousin
richard
nay
i
will
place
no
wager
on
the
event
replied
the
young
man
well
as
you
please
cried
the
squire
but
i
would
lay
five
to
one
that
mistress
nutter
beats
the
magistrate
meanwhile
the
whole
troop
having
set
forward
they
soon
arrived
at
the
second
stone
grey
and
it
was
deeply
imbedded
in
the
soil
and
to
all
appearance
had
rested
undisturbed
for
many
a
year
you
measure
from
the
clough
i
presume
sir
remarked
potts
to
nowell
to
be
sure
replied
the
magistrate
but
how
is
this
this
stone
seems
to
me
much
nearer
the
clough
than
it
used
to
be
yeigh
so
it
dun
mester
observed
old
mitton
it
does
not
appear
to
have
been
disturbed
at
all
events
said
nicholas
dismounting
and
examining
it
it
would
seem
not
said
nowell
and
yet
it
certainly
is
not
in
its
old
place
yo
are
mistaen
mester
observed
jem

ey
knoa

weel
an

twenty
year
it
neeburs
yeigh
yeigh
responded
several
voices
well
let
us
go
on
to
the
next
stone
said
potts
looking
rather
blank
accordingly
they
went
forward
the
hinds
exchanging
significant
looks
and
roger
nowell
and
nicholas
carefully
examining
their
respective
maps
these
landmarks
exactly
tally
with
my
plan
said
the
squire
as
they
arrived
at
the
third
stone
but
not
with
mine
said
nowell
this
stone
ought
to
be
two
hundred
yards
to
the
right
some
trickery
has
been
practised
impossible
exclaimed
the
squire
these
ponderous
masses
could
never
have
been
moved
besides
there
are
several
persons
here
who
know
every
inch
of
the
ground
and
will
give
you
their
unbiassed
testimony
what
say
you
my
men
are
these
the
old
boundary
stones
all
answered
in
the
affirmative
except
old
mitton
who
still
raised
a
dissenting
voice
they
be
th
owd
boundary
marks
sure
enough
he
said
boh
they
are
neaw
i
their
owd
places
it
is
quite
clear
that
the
twenty
acres
belong
to
mistress
nutter
observed
nicholas
and
that
you
must
content
yourself
with
ten
master
nowell
make
an
entry
to
that
effect
master
potts
unless
you
will
have
the
ground
measured
no
it
is
needless
replied
the
magistrate
sharply
let
us
go
on
during
this
survey
some
of
the
features
of
the
country
appeared
changed
to
the
rustics
but
how
or
in
what
way
they
could
not
precisely
tell
and
they
were
easily
induced
by
james
device
to
give
their
testimony
in
mistress
nutter
favour
a
small
rivulet
was
now
reached
and
another
halt
being
called
upon
its
sedgy
banks
the
plans
were
again
consulted
what
have
we
here
master
potts
marks
or
boundaries
inquired
richard
with
a
smile
both
replied
potts
angrily
this
rivulet
which
i
take
to
be
moss
brook
is
a
boundary
and
that
sheepfold
and
the
two
posts
standing
in
a
line
with
it
are
marks
but
hold
how
is
this
he
cried
regarding
the
plan
in
dismay
the
five
acres
of
waste
land
should
be
on
the
left
of
the
brook
it
would
doubtless
suit
master
nowell
better
if
it
were
so
said
nicholas
but
as
they
chance
to
be
on
the
right
they
belong
to
mistress
nutter
i
merely
speak
from
the
plan
your
plan
is
naught
sir
cried
nowell
furiously
by
what
foul
practice
these
changes
have
been
wrought
i
pretend
not
to
say
though
i
can
give
a
good
guess
but
the
audacious
witch
who
has
thus
deluded
me
shall
bitterly
rue
it
hold
hold
master
nowell
rejoined
nicholas
i
can
make
great
allowance
for
your
anger
which
is
natural
considering
your
disappointment
but
i
will
not
permit
such
unwarrantable
insinuations
to
be
thrown
out
against
mistress
nutter
you
agreed
to
abide
by
sir
ralph
assheton
award
and
you
must
not
complain
if
it
be
made
against
you
do
you
imagine
that
this
stream
can
have
changed
its
course
in
a
single
night
or
that
yon
sheepfold
has
been
removed
to
the
further
side
of
it
i
do
replied
nowell
and
so
do
i
cried
potts
it
has
been
accomplished
by
the
aid
of
but
feeling
himself
checked
by
a
glance
from
the
reeve
he
stammered
out
of
of
mother
demdike
you
declared
just
now
that
marks
meres
and
boundaries
were
unremovable
master
potts
said
the
reeve
with
a
sneer
you
have
altered
your
opinion
the
crestfallen
attorney
was
dumb
master
roger
nowell
must
find
some
better
plea
than
the
imputation
of
witchcraft
to
set
aside
mistress
nutter
claim
observed
richard
yeigh
that
he
mun
cried
james
device
and
the
hinds
who
supported
him
the
magistrate
bit
his
lips
with
vexation
there
is
witchcraft
in
it
i
repeat
he
said
yeigh
that
there
be
responded
old
mitton
but
the
words
were
scarcely
uttered
when
he
was
felled
to
the
ground
by
the
bludgeon
of
james
device
ey
sarve
thee
i
t

way
fo
two
pins
said
jem
regarding
potts
with
a
savage
look
no
violence
jem
cried
nicholas
authoritatively
you
do
harm
to
the
cause
you
would
serve
by
your
outrageous
conduct

jem
boh

no

on
her
here
cried
the
hinds
well
master
nowell
said
nicholas
are
you
willing
to
concede
the
matter
at
once
or
will
you
pursue
the
investigation
further
i
will
ascertain
the
extent
of
the
mischief
done
to
me
before
i
stop
rejoined
the
magistrate
angrily
forward
then
cried
nicholas
our
course
now
lies
along
this
footpath
with
a
croft
on
the
left
and
an
old
barn
on
the
right
here
the
plans
correspond
i
believe
master
potts
the
attorney
yielded
a
reluctant
assent
there
is
next
a
small
spring
and
trough
on
the
right
and
we
then
come
to
a
limestone
quarry
then
by
a
plantation
called
cat
gallows
wood
so
named
because
some
troublesome
mouser
has
been
hanged
there
i

and
next
by
a
deep
called
swallow
hole
all
right
eh
master
potts
we
shall
now
enter
upon
worston
moor
and
come
to
the
hut
occupied
by
jem

who
can
it

presumed
speak
positively
as
to
its
situation
very
true
cried
potts
as
if
struck
by
an
idea
let
the
rascal
step
forward
i
wish
to
put
a
few
questions
to

jem

its

the
attorney
sartinly

jem
without
heeding
a
significant
glance
cast
at
him
by
the
reeve
it
stonds
behind
yon
kloof
ot

o

wi
a
rindle
in
front
now
mind
what
you
say
sirrah
cried
potts
you
are
quite
sure
the
hut
is
behind
the
clough
and
the
rindle
which
being
interpreted
from
your
base
vernacular
i
believe
means
a
gutter
in
front
of
it
the
reeve
coughed
slightly
but
failed
to
attract
jem
attention
who
replied
quickly
that
he
was
quite
sure
of
the
circumstances
very
well
said
potts
you
have
all
heard
the
answer
he
is
quite
sure
as
to
what
he
states
now
then
i
suppose
you
can
tell
whether
the
hut
looks
to
the
north
or
the
south
whether
the
door
opens
to
the
moor
or
to
the
clough
and
whether
there
is
a
path
leading
from
it
to
a
spot
called
hook
cliff
at
this
moment
jem
caught
the
eye
of
the
reeve
and
the
look
given
him
by
the
latter
completely
puzzled
him
ey
dunna
reetly
recollect
which
way
it
looks
he
answered
what
you
prevaricating
rascal
do
you
pretend
to
say
that
you
do
not
know
which
way
your
own
dwelling
stands
thundered
roger
nowell
speak
out
sirrah
or
sparshot
shall
take
you
into
custody
at
once
ey
ready
your
worship
replied
the
beadle
weel
then
said
jem
imperfectly
comprehending
the
signs
made
to
him
by
the
reeve
the
hut
looks
nather
to
t
south
naw
to
t
north
but
to
t
west
it
feaces
t
moor
an
there
is
a
path
fro
it
to
hook
cliff
as
he
finished
speaking
he
saw
from
the
reeve
angry
gestures
that
he
had
made
a
mistake
but
it
was
now
too
late
to
recall
his
words
however
he
determined
to
make
an
effort
now
ey
bethink
me
ey
naw
sure
that
ey
reet
he
said
you
must
be

sirrah
said
roger
nowell
bending
his
awful
brows
upon
him
you
can
not
be
mistaken
as
to
your
own
dwelling
take
down
his
description
master
potts
and
proceed
with
your
interrogatories
if
you
have
any
more
to
put
to
him
i
wish
to
ask
him
whether
he
has
been
at
home
said
potts
answer
fellow
thundered
the
magistrate
before
replying
jem
would
fain
have
consulted
the
reeve
but
the
latter
had
turned
away
in
displeasure
not
knowing
whether
a
lie
would
serve
his
turn
and
fearing
he
might
be
contradicted
by
some
of
the
bystanders
he
said
he
had
not
been
at
home
for
two
days
but
had
returned
the
night
before
at
a
late
hour
from
whalley
and
had
slept
at
rough
lee
then
you
can
not
tell
what
changes
may
have
taken
place
in
your
dwelling
during
your
absence
said
potts
of
course
not

jem
boh

so
short
a
time

i

potts
be
pleased
to
give
me
your
plan
master

i

a
further
question
to
ask
him
he
added
after
consulting
it
for
a
moment
ey
win
awnser
nowt
more
replied
jem
gruffly
you
will
answer
whatever
questions
master
potts
may
put
to
you
or
you
are
taken
into
custody
said
the
magistrate
sternly
jem
would
have
willingly
beaten
a
retreat
but
being
surrounded
by
the
two
grooms
and
sparshot
who
only
waited
a
sign
from
nowell
to
secure
him
or
knock
him
down
if
he
attempted
to
fly
he
gave
a
surly
intimation
that
he
was
ready
to
speak
you
are
aware
that
a
dyke
intersects
the
heath
before
us
namely
worston
moor
said
potts
jem
nodded
his
head
i
must
request
particular
attention
to
your
plan
as
i
proceed
master
nicholas
pursued
the
attorney
i
now
wish
to
be
informed
by
you
james
device
whether
that
dyke
cuts
through
the
middle
of
the
moor
or
traverses
the
side
and
if
so
which
side
i
desire
also
to
be
informed
where
it
commences
and
where
it
ends
jem
scratched
his
head
and
reflected
a
moment
the
matter
does
not
require
consideration
sirrah
cried
nowell
i
must
have
an
instant
answer
so
yo
shan
replied
jem
weel
then
th
dyke

a

about

cried
potts
scarcely
able
to
conceal
his
satisfaction
swere
it
eigh
replied
jem
eigh
aw
swere
it
chorused
the
hinds
i
delighted
to
hear
it
cried
potts
radiant
with
delight
for
your
description
corresponds
exactly
with
master
nowell
plan
and
differs
materially
from
that
of
mistress
nutter
as
squire
nicholas
assheton
will
tell
you
i
can
not
deny
it
replied
nicholas
in
some
confusion
ey
should
ha
said

boh
yo

wi

the

you

the
contrary
cried
nowell
secure
him
he
added
to
the
grooms
and
sparshot
and
do
not
let
him
go
till
we
have
completed
the
survey
we
will
now
see
how
far
the
reality
corresponds
with
the
description
and
what
further
devilish
tricks
have
been
played
with
the
property
upon
this
the
troop
was
again
put
in
motion
james
device
walking
between
the
two
grooms
with
sparshot
behind
him
so
wonderfully
elated
was
master
potts
by
the
successful
hit
he
had
just
made
and
which
in
his
opinion
quite
counterbalanced
his
previous
failure
that
he
could
not
help
communicating
his
satisfaction
to
flint
and
this
in
such
manner
that
the
fiery
little
animal
who
had
been
for
some
time
exceedingly
tractable
and
took
umbrage
at
it
and
threatened
to
dislodge
him
if
he
did
not
desist
from
his
vagaries
delivering
the
hint
so
clearly
and
unmistakeably
that
it
was
not
lost
upon
his
rider
who
endeavoured
to
calm
him
down
in
proportion
as
the
attorney
spirits
rose
those
of
james
device
and
his
followers
sank
for
they
felt
they
were
caught
in
a
snare
from
which
they
could
not
easily
escape
by
this
time
they
had
reached
the
borders
of
worston
moor
which
had
been
hitherto
concealed
by
a
piece
of
rising
ground
covered
with
gorse
and
brushwood
and
jem
hut
together
with
the
clough
the
rindle
and
the
dyke
came
distinctly
into
view
the
plans
were
again
produced
and
on
comparing
them
it
appeared
that
the
various
landmarks
were
precisely
situated
as
laid
down
by
mistress
nutter
while
their
disposition
was
entirely
at
variance
with
james
device
statement
master
potts
then
rose
in
his
stirrups
and
calling
for
silence
addressed
the
assemblage
there
stands
the
hut
he
said
and
instead
of
being
behind
the
clough
it
is
on
one
side
of
it
while
the
door
certainly
does
face
the
moor
neither
is
the
rindle
in
front
of
the
dwelling
or
near
it
while
the
dyke
which
is
the
main
and
important
boundary
line
between
the
properties
runs
above
two
hundred
yards
further
west
than
formerly
now
observe
the
original
position
of
these
marks
meres
and
boundaries
that
is
of
this
hut
this
clough
this
rindle
and
this
dyke
exactly
corresponds
with
the
description
given
of
them
by
the
man
device
who
dwells
in
the
place
and
who
is
therefore
a
person
most
likely
to
be
accurately
acquainted
with
the
country
and
yet
though
he
has
only
been
absent
two
days
changes
the
most
surprising
have
taken
place
changes
so
surprising
indeed
that
he
scarcely
knows
the
way
to
his
own
house
and
certainly
never
could
find
the
path
which
he
has
described
as
leading
to
hook
cliff
since
it
is
entirely
obliterated
observe
further
all
these
extraordinary
and
incomprehensible
changes
in
the
appearance
of
the
country
and
in
the
situation
of
the
marks
meres
and
boundaries
are
favourable
to
mistress
nutter
and
give
her
the
advantage
she
seeks
over
my
honoured
and
honourable
client
they
are
set
down
in
mistress
nutter
plan
it
is
true
but
when
let
me
ask
was
that
plan
prepared
in
my
opinion
it
was
prepared
first
and
the
changes
in
the
land
made
after
it
by
diabolical
fraud
and
contrivance
i
am
sorry
to
have
to
declare
this
to
you
master
nicholas
and
to
you
master
richard
but
such
is
my
firm
conviction
and
mine
also
added
nowell
and
i
here
charge
mistress
nutter
with
sorcery
and
witchcraft
and
on
my
return
i
will
immediately
issue
a
warrant
for
her
arrest
sparshot
i
command
you
to
attach
the
person
of
james
device
for
aiding
and
abetting
her
in
her
foul
practices
i
will
help
you
to
take
charge
of
him
said
the
reeve
riding
forward
probably
this
was
done
to
give
jem
a
chance
of
escape
and
if
so
it
was
successful
for
as
the
reeve
pushed
among
his
captors
and
thrust
sparshot
aside
the
ruffian
broke
from
them
and
running
with
great
swiftness
across
the
moor
plunged
into
the
clough
and
disappeared
nicholas
and
richard
instantly
gave
chase
as
did
master
potts
but
the
fugitive
led
them
over
the
treacherous
bog
in
such
a
manner
as
to
baffle
all
pursuit
a
second
disaster
here
overtook
the
unlucky
attorney
and
damped
him
in
his
hour
of
triumph
flint
who
had
apparently
not
forgotten
or
forgiven
the
joyous
kicks
he
had
recently
received
from
the
attorney
heels
came
to
a
sudden
halt
by
the
side
of
the
quagmire
and
putting
down
his
head
and
flinging
up
his
legs
cast
him
into
it
while
potts
was
scrambling
out
the
animal
galloped
off
in
the
direction
of
the
clough
and
had
just
reached
it
when
he
was
seized
upon
by
james
device
who
suddenly
started
from
the
covert
and
vaulted
upon
his
back
chapter
rough
lee
on
returning
from
their
unsuccessful
pursuit
of
james
device
the
two
asshetons
found
roger
nowell
haranguing
the
hinds
who
on
the
flight
of
their
leader
would
have
taken
to
their
heels
likewise
if
they
had
not
been
detained
partly
by
the
energetic
efforts
of
sparshot
and
the
grooms
and
partly
by
the
exhortations
and
menaces
of
the
magistrate
and
holden
as
it
was
two
or
three
contrived
to
get
away
and
fled
across
the
moor
whither
the
reeve
pretended
to
pursue
them
while
those
left
behind
were
taken
sharply
to
task
by
roger
nowell
listen
to
me
he
cried
and
take
good
heed
to
what
i
say
for
it
concerns
you
nearly
strange
and
dreadful
things
have
come
under
my
observation
on
my
way
hither
i
have
seen
a
whole
village
stricken
as
by
a
plague
a
poor
pedlar
deprived
of
the
use
of
his
limbs
and
put
in
peril
of
his
life
and
a
young
maiden
once
the
pride
and
ornament
of
your
own
village
snatched
from
a
fond
father
care
and
borne
to
an
untimely
grave
these
things
i
have
seen
with
my
own
eyes
and
i
am
resolved
that
the
perpetrators
of
these
enormities
mothers
demdike
and
chattox
shall
be
brought
to
justice
as
to
you
the
deluded
victims
of
the
impious
hags
i
can
easily
understand
why
you
shut
your
eyes
to
their
evil
doings
terrified
by
their
threats
you
submit
to
their
exactions
and
so
become
their
slaves
slaves
of
the
of
satan
what
miserable
servitude
is
this
by
so
doing
you
not
only
endanger
the
welfare
of
your
souls
by
leaguing
with
the
enemies
of
heaven
and
render
yourselves
unworthy
to
be
classed
with
a
religious
and
christian
people
but
you
place
your
lives
in
jeopardy
by
becoming
accessories
to
the
crimes
of
those
great
offenders
and
render
yourselves
liable
to
like
punishment
with
them
seeing
then
the
imminency
of
the
peril
in
which
you
stand
you
will
do
well
to
avoid
it
while
there
is
yet
time
nor
is
this
your
only
risk
your
servitude
to
mistress
nutter
is
equally
perilous
what
if
she
be
owner
of
the
land
you
till
and
the
flocks
you
tend
you
owe
her
no
fealty
she
has
forfeited
all
title
to
your
service
and
so
far
from
aiding
her
you
ought
to
regard
her
as
a
great
criminal
whom
you
are
bound
to
bring
to
justice
i
have
now
incontestable
proofs
of
her
dealing
in
the
black
art
and
can
show
that
by
witchcraft
she
has
altered
the
face
of
this
country
with
the
intent
to
rob
me
of
my
land
holden
now
took
up
the
theme
the
finger
of
heaven
is
pointed
against
such
robbery
he
cried
is
he
saith
the
scripture
removeth
his
neighbour
landmark
and
again
it
is
written
is
he
that
smiteth
his
neighbour
secretly
both
these
things
hath
mistress
nutter
done
and
for
both
shall
she
incur
divine
vengeance
neither
shall
she
escape
that
of
man
added
nowell
severely
for
our
sovereign
lord
hath
enacted
that
all
persons
employing
or
rewarding
any
evil
spirit
shall
be
held
guilty
of
felony
and
shall
suffer
death
and
death
will
be
her
portion
for
such
demoniacal
agency
most
assuredly
hath
she
employed
the
magistrate
here
paused
for
a
moment
to
regard
his
audience
and
reading
in
their
terrified
looks
that
his
address
had
produced
the
desired
impression
he
continued
with
increased
severity
these
wicked
women
shall
trouble
the
land
no
longer
they
shall
be
arrested
and
brought
to
judgment
and
if
you
do
not
heartily
bestir
yourselves
in
their
capture
and
undertake
to
appear
in
evidence
against
them
you
shall
be
held
and
dealt
with
as
accessories
in
their
crimes
upon
this
the
hinds
who
were
greatly
alarmed
declared
with
one
accord
their
willingness
to
act
as
the
magistrate
should
direct
you
do
wisely
cried
potts
who
by
this
time
had
made
his
way
back
to
the
assemblage
covered
from
head
to
foot
with
ooze
as
on
his
former
misadventure
mistress
nutter
and
the
two
old
hags
who
hold
you
in
thrall
would
lead
you
to
destruction
for
understand
it
is
the
firm
determination
of
my
respected
client
master
roger
nowell
as
well
as
of
myself
not
to
relax
in
our
exertions
till
the
whole
of
these
pestilent
witches
who
trouble
the
country
be
swept
away
and
to
spare
none
who
assist
and
uphold
them
the
hinds
stared
aghast
for
so
grim
was
the
appearance
of
the
attorney
that
they
almost
thought
hobthurst
the
was
addressing
them
at
this
moment
old
henry
mitton
came
up
he
had
partially
recovered
from
the
stunning
effects
of
the
blow
dealt
him
by
james
device
but
his
head
was
cut
open
and
his
white
locks
were
dabbled
in
blood
pushing
his
way
through
the
assemblage
he
stood
before
the
magistrate
if
yo
want
a

agen
that
foul
murtheress
and
witch
alice

and
damning
offences
an
among
the
murder
by
witchcraft
her
husband
ruchot
nutter
a
thrill
of
horror
pervaded
the
assemblage
at
this
denunciation
and
master
potts
who
was
being
cleansed
from
his
sable
stains
by
one
of
the
grooms
cried
out
this
is
the
very
man
for

my
excellent
client
your

harry

the

ey

seventy

we

said
potts
and
if

sustained
any
private
wrongs
from
mistress

they
shall
be
amply
redressed
ey
ha
endured
much
ot
her

rejoined
mitton
boh
ey
dunna

o

it
be
high
time
that
owd
scrat
should
ha
his
claws
clipt
an
honest
folk
be
allowed
to
live
in
peace
very
true
my
worthy
friend
very
true
assented
potts
an
immediate
return
to
whalley
was
now
proposed
by
nowell
but
master
potts
was
of
opinion
that
as
they
were
in
the
neighbourhood
of
malkin
tower
they
should
proceed
thither
at
once
and
effect
the
arrest
of
mother
demdike
after
which
mother
chattox
could
be
sought
out
and
secured
the
presence
of
these
two
witches
would
be
most
important
he
declared
in
the
examination
of
mistress
nutter
hue
and
cry
for
the
fugitive
james
device
ought
also
to
be
made
throughout
the
forest
confounded
by
what
they
heard
richard
and
nicholas
had
hitherto
taken
no
part
in
the
proceedings
but
they
now
seconded
master
proposition
hoping
that
the
time
occupied
by
the
visit
to
malkin
tower
would
prove
serviceable
to
mistress
nutter
for
they
did
not
doubt
that
intelligence
would
be
conveyed
to
her
by
some
of
her
agents
of
intention
to
arrest
her
additional
encouragement
was
given
to
the
plan
by
the
arrival
of
richard
baldwyn
who
at
this
juncture
rode
furiously
up
to
the
party
weel
han
yo
settled
your
business
here
mester
nowell
he
asked
in
breathless
anxiety
we
have
so
far
settled
it
that
we
have
established
proofs
of
witchcraft
against
mistress
nutter
replied
nowell
can
you
speak
to
her
character
baldwyn
yeigh
that
ey

and
so

wonst
you
have
come
most
opportunely
baldwyn
observed
potts
we
were
just
considering
whether
we
should
go
to
malkin
tower
then
decide
upon
rejoined
the
miller
or
th
owd
hag
win
escape
ye
tak
her
unaweares
i
do
know
that
we
shall
take
her
unawares
baldwyn
said
potts
but
i
am
decidedly
of
opinion
that
we
should
go
thither
without
delay
is
malkin
tower
far
off
about
a
mile
fro
rough
lee
replied
the
miller
go
back
wi
me
to
mill
where
yo
con
refresh
yourselves
an
get
together
some
dozen
o
my
friends
an
then
aw
go
up
to
t
tower
together
a
very
good
suggestion
said
potts
and
no
doubt
master
nowell
will
accede
to
it
we
have
force
enough
already
it
appears
to
me
observed
nowell
i
should
think
so
replied
richard
some
dozen
men
armed
against
a
poor
defenceless
old
woman
are
surely
enough
owd
boh
neaw
defenceless
mester
ruchot
rejoined
baldwyn
yo
canna
go
i
too
great
force
on
an
expedition
like
this
malkin
tower
is
a
varry
strong
place
os
find
well
said
nowell
since
we
are
here
i
agree
with
master
potts
that
it
would
be
better
to
secure
these
two
offenders
and
convey
them
to
whalley
where
their
examination
can
be
taken
at
the
same
time
with
that
of
mistress
nutter
we
therefore
accept
your
offer
of
refreshment
baldwyn
as
some
of
our
party
may
stand
in
need
of
it
and
will
at
once
proceed
to
the
mill
well
resolved
sir
said
potts
tae
th
owd
witch
dead
or
alive
cried
baldwyn
alive
we
must
have
her
alive
good
baldwyn
said
potts
you
must
see
her
perish
at
the
stake
reet
mon
cried
the
miller
his
eyes
blazing
with
fury
that
true
vengeance
ride
whoam
an
get
aw
ready
fo
ye
yo
knoa
t
road
so
saying
he
struck
spurs
into
his
horse
and
galloped
off
scarcely
was
he
gone
than
the
reeve
who
had
kept
out
of
his
sight
came
forward
since
you
have
resolved
upon
going
to
malkin
tower
he
said
to
nowell
and
have
a
sufficiently
numerous
party
for
the
purpose
my
further
attendance
can
be
dispensed
with
i
will
ride
in
search
of
james
device
do
so
replied
the
magistrate
and
let
hue
and
cry
be
made
after
him
it
shall
be
replied
the
reeve
and
if
taken
he
shall
be
conveyed
to
whalley
and
he
made
towards
the
clough
as
if
with
the
intention
of
putting
his
words
into
execution
word
was
now
given
to
set
forward
and
master
potts
having
been
accommodated
with
a
horse
by
one
of
the
grooms
who
proceeded
on
foot
the
party
began
to
retrace
their
course
to
the
mill
they
were
soon
again
by
the
side
of
pendle
water
and
erelong
reached
rough
lee
as
they
rode
through
the
close
at
the
back
of
the
mansion
roger
nowell
halted
for
a
moment
and
observed
with
a
grim
smile
to
richard
never
more
shall
mistress
nutter
enter
that
house
within
a
week
she
shall
be
lodged
in
lancaster
castle
as
a
felon
of
the
darkest
dye
and
she
shall
meet
a
felon
fate
and
not
only
shall
she
be
sent
thither
but
all
her
partners
in
guilt
mother
demdike
and
her
accursed
brood
the
devices
old
chattox
and
her
nance
redferne
not
one
shall
escape
you
do
not
include
alizon
device
in
your
list
cried
richard
i
include
all
i
will
spare
none
rejoined
nowell
sternly
then
i
will
move
no
further
with
you
said
richard
how
cried
newell
are
you
an
upholder
of
these
witches
beware
what
you
do
young
man
beware
how
you
take
part
with
them
you
will
bring
suspicion
upon
yourself
and
get
entangled
in
a
net
from
which
you
will
not
easily
escape
i
care
not
what
may
happen
to
me
rejoined
richard
i
will
never
lend
myself
to
gross
injustice
such
as
you
are
about
to
practise
since
you
announce
your
intention
of
including
the
innocent
with
the
guilty
of
exterminating
a
whole
family
for
the
crimes
of
one
or
two
of
its
members
i
have
done
you
have
made
dark
accusations
against
mistress
nutter
but
you
have
proved
nothing
you
assert
that
by
witchcraft
she
has
changed
the
features
of
your
land
but
in
what
way
can
you
make
good
the
charge
old
mitton
has
indeed
volunteered
himself
as
a
witness
against
her
and
has
accused
her
of
most
heinous
offences
but
he
has
at
the
same
time
shown
that
he
is
her
enemy
and
his
testimony
will
be
regarded
with
doubt
i
will
not
believe
her
guilty
on
mere
suspicion
and
i
deny
that
you
have
aught
more
to
proceed
upon
i
shall
not
argue
the
point
with
you
now
sir
replied
nowell
angrily
mistress
nutter
will
be
fairly
tried
and
if
i
fail
in
my
proofs
against
her
she
will
be
acquitted
but
i
have
little
fear
of
such
a
result
he
added
with
a
sinister
smile
you
are
confident
sir
because
you
know
there
would
be
every
disposition
to
find
her
guilty
replied
richard
she
will
not
be
fairly
tried
all
the
prejudices
of
ignorance
and
superstition
heightened
by
the
published
opinions
of
the
king
will
be
arrayed
against
her
were
she
as
free
from
crime
or
thought
of
crime
as
the
babe
once
charged
with
the
horrible
and
inexplicable
offence
of
witchcraft
she
would
scarce
escape
you
go
determined
to
destroy
her
i
will
not
deny
it
said
roger
newell
and
i
am
satisfied
that
i
shall
render
good
service
to
society
by
freeing
it
from
so
vile
a
member
so
abhorrent
is
the
crime
of
witchcraft
that
were
my
own
son
suspected
i
would
be
the
first
to
deliver
him
to
justice
like
a
noxious
and
poisonous
plant
the
offence
has
taken
deep
root
in
this
country
and
is
spreading
its
baneful
influence
around
so
that
if
it
be
not
extirpated
it
may
spring
up
anew
and
cause
incalculable
mischief
but
it
shall
now
be
effectually
checked
of
the
families
i
have
mentioned
not
one
shall
escape
and
if
mistress
nutter
herself
had
a
daughter
she
should
be
brought
to
judgment
in
such
cases
children
must
suffer
for
the
sins
of
the
parents
you
have
no
regard
then
for
their
innocence
said
richard
who
felt
as
if
a
weight
of
calamity
was
crushing
him
down
their
innocence
must
be
proved
at
the
proper
tribunal
rejoined
nowell
it
is
not
for
me
to
judge
them
but
you
do
judge
them
cried
richard
sharply
in
making
the
charge
you
know
that
you
pronounce
the
sentence
of
condemnation
as
well
this
is
why
the
humane
man
why
the
just
would
hesitate
to
bring
an
accusation
even
where
he
suspected
guilt
but
where
suspicion
could
not
possibly
attach
he
would
never
suffer
himself
however
urged
on
by
feelings
of
animosity
to
injure
the
innocent
you
ascribe
most
unworthy
motives
to
me
young
sir
rejoined
nowell
sternly
i
am
influenced
only
by
a
desire
to
see
justice
administered
and
i
shall
not
swerve
from
my
duty
because
my
humanity
may
be
called
in
question
by
a
boy
i
understand
why
you
plead
thus
warmly
for
these
infamous
persons
you
are
enthralled
by
the
beauty
of
the
young
witch
alizon
device
i
noted
how
you
were
struck
by
her
yesterday
and
i
heard
what
sir
thomas
metcalfe
said
on
the
subject
but
take
heed
what
you
do
you
may
jeopardise
both
soul
and
body
in
the
indulgence
of
this
fatal
passion
witchcraft
is
exercised
in
many
ways
its
professors
have
not
only
power
to
maim
and
to
kill
and
to
do
other
active
mischief
but
to
ensnare
the
affections
and
endanger
the
souls
of
their
victims
by
enticing
them
to
unhallowed
love
alizon
device
is
comely
to
view
no
doubt
but
who
shall
say
whence
her
beauty
is
derived
hell
may
have
arrayed
her
in
its
fatal
charms
sin
is
beautiful
but
and
the
time
will
come
when
you
may
thank
me
for
delivering
you
from
the
snares
of
this
seductive
siren
richard
uttered
an
angry
exclamation
not
now
i
do
not
expect
it
you
are
too
much
besotted
by
her
pursued
nowell
but
i
conjure
you
to
cast
off
this
wicked
and
senseless
passion
which
unless
checked
will
lead
you
to
perdition
you
have
heard
what
abominable
rites
are
practised
at
those
unholy
meetings
called
devil
sabbaths
and
how
can
you
say
that
some
demon
may
not
be
your
rival
in
alizon
love
you
pass
all
licence
sir
cried
richard
infuriated
past
endurance
and
if
you
do
not
instantly
retract
the
infamous
accusation
you
have
made
neither
your
age
nor
your
office
shall
protect
you
i
can
fortunately
protect
myself
young
man
replied
nowell
coldly
and
if
aught
were
wanting
to
confirm
my
suspicions
that
you
were
under
some
evil
influence
it
would
be
supplied
by
your
present
conduct
you
are
bewitched
by
this
girl
it
is
false
cried
richard
and
he
raised
his
hand
against
the
magistrate
when
nicholas
quickly
interposed
nay
cousin
dick
cried
the
squire
this
must
not
be
you
must
take
other
means
of
defending
the
poor
girl
whose
innocence
i
will
maintain
as
stoutly
as
yourself
but
since
master
roger
nowell
is
resolved
to
proceed
to
extremities
i
shall
likewise
take
leave
to
retire
your
pardon
sir
rejoined
nowell
you
will
not
withdraw
till
i
think
fit
master
richard
assheton
forgetful
alike
of
the
respect
due
to
age
and
constituted
authority
has
ventured
to
raise
his
hand
against
me
for
which
if
i
chose
i
could
place
him
in
immediate
arrest
but
i
have
no
such
intention
on
the
contrary
i
am
willing
to
overlook
the
insult
attributing
it
to
the
frenzy
by
which
he
is
possessed
but
both
he
and
you
master
nicholas
are
mistaken
if
you
suppose
i
will
permit
you
to
retire
as
a
magistrate
in
the
exercise
of
my
office
i
call
upon
you
both
to
aid
me
in
the
capture
of
the
two
notorious
witches
mothers
demdike
and
chattox
and
not
to
desist
or
depart
from
me
till
such
capture
be
effected
you
know
the
penalty
of
refusal
heavy
fine
or
imprisonment
at
the
option
of
the
magistrate
remarked
potts
my
cousin
nicholas
will
do
as
he
pleases
observed
richard
but
for
my
part
i
will
not
stir
a
step
further
nor
will
i
added
nicholas
unless
i
have
master
nowell
solemn
pledge
that
he
will
take
no
proceedings
against
alizon
device
you
can
give
no
such
assurance
sir
whispered
potts
seeing
that
the
magistrate
wavered
in
his
resolution
you
must
go
then
said
nowell
and
take
the
consequences
of
your
refusal
to
act
with
me
your
relationship
to
mistress
nutter
will
not
tell
in
your
favour
i
understand
the
implied
threat
said
nicholas
and
laugh
at
it
richard
lad
i
am
with
you
let
him
catch
the
witches
himself
if
he
can
i
will
not
budge
an
inch
further
with
him
farewell
then
gentlemen
replied
roger
nowell
i
am
sorry
to
part
company
with
you
thus
but
when
next
we
meet
and
he
paused
we
meet
as
enemies
i
presume
supplied
nicholas
we
meet
no
longer
as
friends
rejoined
the
magistrate
coldly
with
this
he
moved
forward
with
the
rest
of
the
troop
while
the
two
asshetons
after
a
moment
consultation
passed
through
a
gate
and
made
their
way
to
the
back
of
the
mansion
where
they
found
one
or
two
men
on
the
from
whom
they
received
intelligence
which
induced
them
immediately
to
spring
from
their
horses
and
hurry
into
the
house
arrived
at
the
principal
entrance
of
the
mansion
which
was
formed
by
large
gates
of
open
admitting
a
view
of
the
garden
and
front
of
the
house
roger
nowell
again
called
a
halt
and
master
potts
at
his
request
addressed
the
porter
and
two
other
who
were
standing
in
the
garden
in
this
fashion
pay
attention
to
what
i
say
to
you
my
men
he
cried
in
a
loud
and
authoritative
voice
a
warrant
will
this
day
be
issued
for
the
arrest
of
alice
nutter
of
rough
lee
in
whose
service
you
have
hitherto
dwelt
and
who
is
charged
with
the
dreadful
crime
of
witchcraft
and
with
invoking
consulting
and
covenanting
with
entertaining
employing
feeding
and
rewarding
evil
spirits
contrary
to
the
laws
of
god
and
man
and
in
express
violation
of
his
majesty
statute
now
take
notice
that
if
the
said
alice
nutter
shall
at
any
time
hereafter
return
to
this
her
former
abode
or
take
refuge
within
it
you
are
hereby
bound
to
deliver
her
up
forthwith
to
the
nearest
constable
to
be
by
him
brought
before
the
worshipful
master
roger
nowell
of
read
in
this
county
so
that
she
may
be
examined
by
him
on
these
charges
you
hear
what
i
have
said
the
men
exchanged
significant
glances
but
made
no
reply
potts
was
about
to
address
them
but
to
his
surprise
he
saw
the
central
door
of
the
house
thrown
open
and
mistress
nutter
issue
from
it
she
marched
slowly
and
majestically
down
the
broad
gravel
walk
towards
the
gate
the
attorney
could
scarcely
believe
his
eyes
and
he
exclaimed
to
the
magistrate
with
a
chuckle
who
would
have
thought
of
this
we
have
her
safe
enough
now
ha
ha
but
no
corresponding
smile
played
upon
nowell
hard
lips
his
gaze
was
fixed
inquiringly
upon
the
lady
another
surprise
from
the
same
door
issued
alizon
device
escorted
by
nicholas
and
richard
assheton
who
walked
on
either
side
of
her
and
the
three
followed
mistress
nutter
slowly
down
the
broad
walk
such
a
display
seemed
to
argue
no
want
of
confidence
alizon
did
not
look
towards
the
group
outside
the
gates
but
seemed
listening
eagerly
to
what
richard
was
saying
to
her
so
master
nowell
cried
mistress
nutter
boldly
since
you
find
yourself
defeated
in
the
claims
you
have
made
against
my
property
you
are
seeking
to
revenge
yourself
i
understand
by
bringing
charges
against
me
as
false
as
they
are
calumnious
but
i
defy
your
malice
and
can
defend
myself
against
your
violence
if
i
could
be
astonished
at
any
thing
in
you
madam
i
should
be
at
your
audacity
rejoined
nowell
but
i
am
glad
that
you
have
presented
yourself
before
me
for
it
was
my
fixed
intention
on
my
return
to
whalley
to
cause
your
arrest
and
your
unexpected
appearance
here
enables
me
to
put
my
design
into
execution
somewhat
sooner
than
i
anticipated
mistress
nutter
laughed
scornfully
sparshot
vociferated
nowell
enter
those
gates
and
arrest
the
lady
in
the
king
name
the
beadle
looked
irresolute
he
did
not
like
the
task
the
gates
are
fastened
cried
mistress
nutter
force
them
open
then
roared
nowell
dismounting
and
shaking
them
furiously
bring
me
a
heavy
stone
by
heaven
i
i
will
not
be
baulked
of
my
prey
my
servants
are
armed
cried
mistress
nutter
and
the
first
man
who
enters
shall
pay
the
penalty
of
has
rashness
with
life
bring
me
a
petronel
blackadder
the
order
was
promptly
obeyed
by
the
attendant
who
was
stationed
near
the
gate
i
am
in
earnest
said
mistress
nutter
aiming
the
petronel
and
seldom
miss
my
mark
give
attention
to
me
my
men
cried
roger
nowell
i
charge
you
in
the
king
name
to
throw
open
the
gate
and
i
charge
you
in
mine
to
keep
it
fast
rejoined
mistress
nutter
we
shall
see
who
will
be
obeyed
one
of
the
grooms
now
advanced
with
a
large
stone
taken
from
an
adjoining
wall
which
he
threw
with
great
force
against
the
gates
but
though
it
shook
them
violently
the
fastenings
continued
firm
blackadder
and
the
two
other
all
of
whom
were
armed
with
halberts
now
advanced
to
the
gates
and
thrusting
the
points
of
their
weapons
through
the
bars
drove
back
those
who
were
near
them
a
short
consultation
now
took
place
between
nowell
and
potts
after
which
the
latter
taking
care
to
keep
out
of
the
reach
of
the
halberts
thus
delivered
himself
in
a
loud
voice
alice
nutter
in
order
to
avoid
the
serious
consequences
which
might
ensue
were
the
necessary
measures
taken
to
effect
a
forcible
entrance
into
your
habitation
the
worshipful
master
nowell
has
thought
fit
to
grant
you
an
hour
respite
for
reflection
at
the
expiration
of
which
time
he
trusts
that
you
seeing
the
futility
of
resisting
the
law
will
quietly
yield
yourself
a
prisoner
otherwise
no
further
leniency
will
be
shown
you
and
those
who
may
uphold
you
in
your
contumacy
mistress
nutter
laughed
loudly
and
contemptuously
at
the
same
time
pursued
potts
on
a
suggestion
from
the
magistrate
master
roger
nowell
demands
that
alizon
device
daughter
of
elizabeth
device
whom
he
beholds
in
your
company
and
who
is
likewise
suspected
of
witchcraft
be
likewised
delivered
up
to
him
aught
more
inquired
mistress
nutter
only
this
replied
potts
in
a
taunting
tone
the
worshipful
magistrate
would
offer
a
friendly
counsel
to
master
nicholas
assheton
and
master
richard
assheton
whom
to
his
infinite
surprise
he
perceives
in
a
hostile
position
before
him
that
they
in
nowise
interfere
with
his
injunctions
but
on
the
contrary
lend
their
aid
in
furtherance
of
them
otherwise
he
may
be
compelled
to
adopt
measures
towards
them
which
must
be
a
source
of
regret
to
him
i
have
furthermore
to
state
on
the
part
of
his
worship
that
strict
watch
will
be
kept
at
all
the
approaches
of
your
house
and
that
no
one
on
any
pretence
whatever
during
the
appointed
time
of
respite
will
be
suffered
to
enter
it
or
depart
from
it
in
an
hour
his
worship
will
return
and
in
an
hour
he
shall
have
my
answer
replied
mistress
nutter
turning
away
chapter
how
rough
lee
was
defended
by
nicholas
when
skies
are
darkest
and
storms
are
gathering
thickest
overhead
the
star
of
love
will
oft
shine
out
with
greatest
brilliancy
and
so
while
mistress
nutter
was
hurling
defiance
against
her
foes
at
the
gate
and
laughing
their
menaces
to
scorn
while
those
very
foes
were
threatening
alizon
liberty
and
life
she
had
become
wholly
insensible
to
the
peril
environing
her
and
almost
unconscious
of
any
other
presence
save
that
of
richard
now
her
avowed
lover
for
impelled
by
the
irresistible
violence
of
his
feelings
the
young
man
had
chosen
that
moment
apparently
so
unpropitious
and
so
fraught
with
danger
and
alarm
for
the
declaration
of
his
passion
and
the
offer
of
his
life
in
her
service
a
few
words
were
all
alizon
could
utter
in
reply
but
they
were
enough
they
told
richard
his
passion
was
requited
and
his
devotion
fully
appreciated
sweet
were
those
moments
to
both
sweet
though
sad
like
alizon
her
lover
had
become
insensible
to
all
around
him
engrossed
by
one
thought
and
one
object
he
was
lost
to
aught
else
and
was
only
at
last
aroused
to
what
was
passing
by
the
squire
who
having
removed
to
a
little
distance
from
the
pair
now
gave
utterance
to
a
low
whistle
to
let
them
know
that
mistress
nutter
was
coming
towards
them
the
lady
however
did
not
stop
but
motioning
them
to
follow
entered
the
house
you
have
heard
what
has
passed
she
said
in
an
hour
master
nowell
threatens
to
return
and
arrest
me
and
alizon
that
shall
never
be
cried
richard
with
a
passionate
look
at
the
young
girl
we
will
defend
you
with
our
lives
much
may
be
done
in
an
hour
observed
nicholas
to
mistress
nutter
and
my
advice
to
you
is
to
use
the
time
allowed
you
in
making
good
your
retreat
so
that
when
the
hawks
come
back
they
may
find
the
doves
flown
i
have
no
intention
of
quitting
my
dovecot
replied
mistress
nutter
with
a
bitter
smile
unless
you
are
forcibly
taken
from
it
i
suppose
said
the
squire
a
contingency
not
impossible
if
you
await
roger
nowell
return
this
time
be
assured
he
will
not
go
away
he
may
not
go
away
at
all
rejoined
mistress
nutter
sternly
then
you
mean
to
make
a
determined
resistance
said
nicholas
recollect
that
you
are
resisting
the
law
i
wish
i
could
induce
you
to
resort
to
the
safer
expedient
of
flight
this
affair
is
already
dark
and
perplexed
enough
and
does
not
require
further
complication
find
any
place
of
concealment
no
matter
where
till
some
arrangement
can
be
made
with
roger
nowell
i
should
rather
urge
you
to
fly
nicholas
rejoined
the
lady
for
it
is
evident
you
have
strong
misgivings
as
to
the
justice
of
my
cause
and
would
not
willingly
compromise
yourself
i
will
not
surrender
to
this
magistrate
because
by
so
doing
my
life
would
assuredly
be
forfeited
for
my
innocence
could
never
be
established
before
the
iniquitous
and
bloody
tribunal
to
which
i
should
be
brought
neither
for
the
same
reason
will
i
surrender
alizon
who
with
a
refinement
of
malignity
has
been
similarly
accused
i
shall
now
proceed
to
make
preparations
for
my
defence
go
if
you
think
fitting
or
stay
but
if
you
stay
i
shall
calculate
upon
your
active
services
you
may
replied
the
squire
whatever
i
may
think
i
admire
your
spirit
and
will
stand
by
you
but
time
is
passing
and
the
foe
will
return
and
find
us
engaged
in
deliberation
when
we
ought
to
be
prepared
you
have
a
dozen
men
on
the
premises
on
whom
you
can
rely
half
of
these
must
be
placed
at
the
back
of
the
house
to
prevent
any
entrance
from
being
effected
in
that
quarter
the
rest
can
remain
within
the
entrance
hall
and
be
ready
to
rush
forth
when
summoned
by
us
but
we
will
not
so
summon
them
unless
we
are
hardly
put
to
it
and
their
aid
is
indispensable
all
should
be
well
armed
but
i
trust
they
will
not
have
to
use
their
weapons
are
you
agreed
to
this
madam
i
am
replied
mistress
nutter
and
i
will
give
instant
directions
that
your
wishes
are
complied
with
all
approaches
to
the
back
of
the
house
shall
be
strictly
guarded
as
you
direct
and
my
trusty
man
blackadder
on
whose
fidelity
and
courage
i
can
entirely
rely
shall
take
the
command
of
the
party
in
the
hall
and
act
under
your
orders
your
prowess
will
not
be
unobserved
for
alizon
and
i
shall
be
in
the
upper
room
commanding
the
garden
whence
we
can
see
all
that
takes
place
a
slight
smile
was
exchanged
between
the
lovers
but
it
was
evident
from
her
anxious
looks
that
alizon
did
not
share
in
confidence
an
opportunity
however
was
presently
afforded
him
of
again
endeavouring
to
reassure
her
for
mistress
nutter
went
forth
to
give
blackadder
his
orders
and
nicholas
betook
himself
to
the
back
of
the
house
to
ascertain
from
personal
inspection
its
chance
of
security
you
are
still
uneasy
dear
alizon
said
richard
taking
her
hand
but
do
not
be
cast
down
no
harm
shall
befall
you
it
is
not
for
myself
i
am
apprehensive
she
replied
but
for
you
who
are
about
to
expose
yourself
to
needless
risk
in
this
encounter
and
if
any
thing
should
happen
to
you
i
shall
be
for
ever
wretched
i
would
far
rather
you
left
me
to
my
fate
and
can
you
think
i
would
allow
you
to
be
borne
away
a
captive
to
ignominy
and
certain
destruction
cried
richard
no
i
will
shed
my
heart
best
blood
before
such
a
calamity
shall
occur
alas
said
alizon
i
have
no
means
of
requiting
your
devotion
all
i
can
offer
you
in
return
is
my
love
and
that
i
fear
will
prove
fatal
to
you
oh
do
not
say
so
cried
richard
why
should
this
sad
presentiment
still
haunt
you
i
strove
to
chase
it
away
just
now
and
hoped
i
had
succeeded
you
are
dearer
to
me
than
life
why
therefore
should
i
not
risk
it
in
your
defence
and
why
should
your
love
prove
fatal
to
me
i
know
not
replied
alizon
in
a
tone
of
deepest
anguish
but
i
feel
as
if
my
destiny
were
evil
and
that
against
my
will
i
shall
drag
those
i
most
love
on
earth
into
the
same
dark
gulf
with
myself
i
have
the
greatest
affection
for
your
sister
dorothy
and
yet
i
have
been
the
unconscious
instrument
of
injury
to
her
and
you
too
richard
who
are
yet
dearer
to
me
are
now
put
in
peril
on
my
account
i
fear
too
when
you
know
my
whole
history
you
will
think
of
me
as
a
thing
of
evil
and
shun
me
what
mean
you
alizon
he
cried
richard
i
can
have
no
secrets
from
you
she
replied
and
though
i
was
forbidden
to
tell
you
what
i
am
now
about
to
disclose
i
will
not
withhold
it
i
was
born
in
this
house
and
am
the
daughter
of
its
mistress
you
tell
me
only
what
i
guessed
alizon
rejoined
the
young
man
but
i
see
nothing
in
this
why
i
should
shun
you
alizon
hid
her
face
for
a
moment
in
her
hands
and
then
looking
up
said
wildly
and
hurriedly
would
i
had
never
known
the
secret
of
my
birth
or
knowing
it
had
never
seen
what
i
beheld
last
night
what
did
you
behold
asked
richard
greatly
agitated
enough
to
convince
me
that
in
gaining
a
mother
i
was
lost
myself
replied
alizon
for
oh
how
can
i
survive
the
shock
of
telling
you
i
am
bound
by
ties
that
can
never
be
dissevered
to
one
abandoned
alike
of
god
and
man
who
has
devoted
herself
to
the
fiend
pity
me
richard
pity
me
and
shun
me
there
was
a
moment
dreadful
pause
which
the
young
man
was
unable
to
break
was
i
not
right
in
saying
my
love
would
be
fatal
to
you
continued
alizon
fly
from
me
while
you
can
richard
fly
from
this
house
or
you
are
lost
for
ever
never
never
i
will
not
stir
without
you
cried
richard
come
with
me
and
escape
all
the
dangers
by
which
you
are
menaced
and
leave
your
sinning
parent
to
the
doom
she
so
richly
merits
no
no
sinful
though
she
be
she
is
still
my
mother
i
can
not
leave
her
cried
alizon
if
you
stay
i
stay
be
the
consequences
what
they
may
replied
the
young
man
but
you
have
rendered
my
arm
powerless
by
what
you
have
told
me
how
can
i
defend
one
whom
i
know
to
be
guilty
therefore
i
urge
you
to
fly
she
rejoined
i
can
reconcile
myself
to
it
thus
said
richard
in
defending
you
whom
i
know
to
be
innocent
i
can
not
avoid
defending
her
the
plea
is
not
a
good
one
but
it
will
suffice
to
allay
my
scruples
of
conscience
at
this
moment
mistress
nutter
entered
the
hall
followed
by
blackadder
and
three
other
men
armed
with
calivers
all
is
ready
richard
she
said
and
it
wants
but
a
few
minutes
of
the
appointed
time
perhaps
you
shrink
from
the
task
you
have
undertaken
she
added
regarding
him
sharply
if
so
say
so
at
once
and
i
will
adopt
my
own
line
of
defence
nay
i
shall
be
ready
to
go
forth
in
a
moment
rejoined
the
young
man
glancing
at
alizon
where
is
nicholas
here
replied
the
squire
clapping
him
on
the
shoulder
all
is
secure
at
the
back
of
the
house
and
the
horses
are
coming
round
we
must
mount
at
once
richard
arose
without
a
word
blackadder
will
attend
to
your
orders
said
mistress
nutter
he
only
waits
a
sign
from
you
to
issue
forth
with
his
three
companions
or
to
fire
through
the
windows
upon
the
aggressors
if
you
see
occasion
for
it
i
trust
it
will
not
come
to
such
a
pass
rejoined
the
squire
a
few
blows
from
these
weapons
will
convince
them
we
are
in
earnest
and
will
i
hope
save
further
trouble
and
as
he
spoke
he
took
down
a
couple
of
stout
staves
and
gave
one
of
them
to
richard
farewell
then
cried
mistress
nutter
with
affected
gaiety
demean
yourselves
valiantly
and
remember
that
bright
eyes
will
be
upon
you
now
alizon
to
our
chamber
richard
did
not
hazard
a
look
at
the
young
girl
as
she
quitted
the
hall
with
her
mother
but
followed
the
squire
mechanically
into
the
garden
where
they
found
the
horses
scarcely
were
they
mounted
than
a
loud
hubbub
arising
from
the
little
village
proclaimed
that
their
opponents
had
arrived
and
presently
after
a
large
company
of
horse
and
foot
appeared
at
the
gate
at
sight
of
the
large
force
brought
against
them
the
countenance
of
the
squire
lost
its
confident
and
jovial
expression
pie
counted
nearly
forty
men
each
of
whom
was
armed
in
some
way
or
other
and
began
to
fear
the
affair
would
terminate
awkwardly
and
entail
unpleasant
consequences
upon
himself
and
his
cousin
he
was
therefore
by
no
means
at
his
ease
as
to
richard
he
did
not
dare
to
ask
himself
how
things
would
end
neither
did
he
know
how
to
act
his
mind
was
in
utter
confusion
and
his
breast
oppressed
as
if
by
a
nightmare
he
cast
one
look
towards
the
upper
window
and
beheld
at
it
the
white
face
of
mistress
nutter
intently
gazing
at
what
was
going
forward
but
alizon
was
not
to
be
seen
within
the
last
half
hour
the
sky
had
darkened
and
a
heavy
cloud
hung
over
the
house
threatening
a
storm
richard
hoped
it
would
come
on
fiercely
and
fast
meanwhile
roger
newell
had
dismounted
and
advanced
to
the
gate
gentlemen
he
cried
addressing
the
two
asshetons
i
expected
to
find
free
access
given
to
me
and
my
followers
but
as
these
gates
are
still
barred
against
me
i
call
upon
you
as
loyal
subjects
of
the
king
not
to
resist
or
impede
the
course
of
law
but
to
throw
them
instantly
open
you
must
unbar
them
yourself
master
nowell
replied
nicholas
we
shall
give
you
no
help
nor
offer
any
opposition
i
hope
sir
said
the
magistrate
sternly
you
are
twenty
to
one
or
thereabout
returned
the
squire
with
a
laugh
we
shall
stand
a
poor
chance
with
you
but
other
defensive
and
offensive
preparations
have
been
made
i
doubt
not
said
nowell
nay
i
descry
some
armed
men
through
the
windows
of
the
hall
before
coming
to
extremities
i
will
make
a
last
appeal
to
you
and
your
kinsman
i
have
granted
mistress
nutter
and
the
girl
with
her
an
hour
delay
in
the
hope
that
seeing
the
futility
of
resistance
they
would
quietly
surrender
but
i
find
my
clemency
thrown
away
and
undue
advantage
taken
of
the
time
allowed
for
respite
therefore
i
shall
show
them
no
further
consideration
but
to
you
my
friends
i
would
offer
a
last
warning
forget
not
that
you
are
acting
in
direct
opposition
to
the
law
that
we
are
here
armed
with
full
authority
and
power
to
carry
out
our
intentions
and
that
all
opposition
on
your
part
will
be
fruitless
and
will
be
visited
upon
you
hereafter
with
severe
pains
and
penalties
forget
not
also
that
your
characters
will
be
irrecoverably
damaged
from
your
connexion
with
parties
charged
with
the
heinous
offence
of
witchcraft
meddle
not
therefore
in
the
matter
but
go
your
ways
or
if
you
would
act
as
best
becomes
you
aid
me
in
the
arrest
of
the
offenders
master
roger
nowell
replied
nicholas
walking
his
horse
slowly
towards
the
gate
as
you
have
given
me
a
caution
i
will
give
you
one
in
return
and
that
is
to
put
a
bridle
on
your
tongue
when
you
address
gentlemen
or
by
my
fay
you
are
likely
to
get
answers
little
to
your
taste
you
have
said
that
our
characters
are
likely
to
suffer
in
this
transaction
but
in
my
humble
opinion
they
will
not
suffer
so
much
as
your
own
the
magistrate
who
uses
the
arm
of
the
law
for
purposes
of
private
vengeance
and
who
brings
a
false
and
foul
charge
against
his
enemy
knowing
that
it
can
not
be
repelled
is
not
entitled
to
any
particular
respect
or
honour
thus
have
you
acted
towards
mistress
nutter
defeated
by
her
in
the
boundary
question
without
leaving
its
decision
to
those
to
whom
you
had
referred
it
you
instantly
accuse
her
of
witchcraft
and
seek
to
destroy
her
as
well
as
an
innocent
and
unoffending
girl
by
whom
she
is
attended
is
such
conduct
worthy
of
you
or
likely
to
redound
to
your
credit
i
think
not
but
this
is
not
all
aided
by
your
crafty
and
unscrupulous
ally
master
potts
you
get
together
a
number
of
mistress
nutter
tenants
and
by
threats
and
misrepresentations
induce
them
to
become
instruments
of
your
vengeance
but
when
these
misguided
men
come
to
know
the
truth
of
the
case
when
they
learn
that
you
have
no
proofs
whatever
against
mistress
nutter
and
that
you
are
influenced
solely
by
animosity
to
her
they
are
quite
as
likely
to
desert
you
as
to
stand
by
you
at
all
events
we
are
determined
to
resist
this
unjust
arrest
and
at
the
hazard
of
our
lives
to
oppose
your
entrance
into
the
house
nowell
and
potts
were
greatly
exasperated
by
this
speech
but
they
were
little
prepared
for
its
consequences
many
of
those
who
had
been
induced
to
accompany
them
as
has
been
shown
wavered
in
their
resolution
of
acting
against
mistress
nutter
but
they
now
began
to
declare
in
her
favour
in
vain
potts
repeated
all
his
former
arguments
they
were
no
longer
of
any
avail
of
the
troop
assembled
at
the
gate
more
than
half
marched
off
and
shaped
their
course
towards
the
rear
of
the
house
with
what
intention
it
was
easy
to
surmise
while
of
those
who
remained
it
was
very
doubtful
whether
the
whole
of
them
would
act
the
result
of
his
oration
was
quite
as
surprising
to
nicholas
as
to
his
opponents
and
enchanted
by
the
effect
of
his
eloquence
he
could
not
help
glancing
up
at
the
window
where
he
perceived
mistress
nutter
whose
smiles
showed
that
she
was
equally
well
pleased
seeing
that
if
any
further
desertions
took
place
his
chances
would
be
at
an
end
with
a
menacing
gesture
at
the
squire
roger
nowell
ordered
the
attack
to
commence
immediately
while
some
of
his
men
amongst
whom
were
baldwyn
and
old
mitton
battered
against
the
gate
with
stones
another
party
headed
by
potts
scaled
the
walls
which
though
of
considerable
height
presented
no
very
serious
obstacles
in
the
way
of
active
assailants
elevated
on
the
shoulders
of
sparshot
potts
was
soon
on
the
summit
of
the
wall
and
was
about
to
drop
into
the
garden
when
he
heard
a
sound
that
caused
him
to
suspend
his
intention
what
are
you
about
to
do
cousin
nicholas
inquired
richard
as
the
word
of
assault
was
given
by
the
magistrate
let
loose
mistress
nutter
upon
them
replied
the
squire
they
are
kept
in
leash
by
a
varlet
stationed
behind
yon
hedge
who
only
awaits
my
signal
to
let
them
slip
and
by
my
faith
it
is
time
he
had
it
as
he
spoke
he
applied
a
to
his
lips
and
blowing
a
loud
call
it
was
immediately
answered
by
a
savage
barking
and
half
a
dozen
hounds
of
prodigious
size
and
power
resembling
in
make
colour
and
ferocity
the
irish
bounded
towards
him
aha
exclaimed
nicholas
clapping
his
hands
to
encourage
them
we
could
have
dispersed
the
whole
rout
with
these
assistants
hyke
tristam
hyke
hubert
upon
them
upon
them
it
was
the
savage
barking
of
the
hounds
that
had
caught
the
ears
of
the
alarmed
attorney
and
made
him
desirous
to
scramble
back
again
but
this
was
no
such
easy
matter
sparshot
broad
shoulders
were
wanting
to
place
his
feet
upon
and
while
he
was
bruising
his
knees
against
the
roughened
sides
of
the
wall
in
vain
attempts
to
raise
himself
to
the
top
of
it
unaided
hubert
sharp
teeth
met
in
the
calf
of
his
leg
while
those
of
tristam
were
fixed
in
the
skirts
of
his
doublet
and
penetrated
deeply
into
the
flesh
that
filled
it
a
terrific
yell
proclaimed
the
attorney
anguish
and
alarm
and
he
redoubled
his
efforts
to
escape
but
if
before
it
was
difficult
to
get
up
the
feat
was
now
impossible
all
he
could
do
was
to
cling
with
desperate
tenacity
to
the
coping
of
the
wall
for
he
made
no
doubt
if
dragged
down
he
should
be
torn
in
pieces
roaring
lustily
for
help
he
besought
nicholas
to
have
compassion
upon
him
but
the
squire
appeared
little
moved
by
his
distress
and
laughed
heartily
at
his
yells
and
vociferations
you
will
not
come
again
on
a
like
errand
in
a
hurry
i
fancy
master
potts
he
said
i
will
not
good
master
nicholas
rejoined
potts
for
pity
sake
call
off
these
infernal
hounds
they
will
rend
me
asunder
as
they
would
a
fox
you
were
a
cunning
fox
in
good
sooth
to
come
hither
rejoined
nicholas
in
a
taunting
tone
but
will
you
go
hence
if
i
liberate
you
i
will
indeed
i
will
replied
potts
and
will
no
more
molest
mistress
nutter
thundered
nicholas
take
heed
what
you
promise
roared
nowell
from
the
other
side
of
the
wall
if
you
do
promise
it
the
hounds
shall
pull
you
down
and
make
a
meal
of
you
cried
nicholas
i
do
i
swear
whatever
you
desire
cried
the
terrified
attorney
the
hounds
were
then
called
off
by
the
squire
and
nerved
by
fright
potts
sprang
upon
the
wall
and
tumbled
over
it
upon
the
other
side
alighting
upon
the
head
of
his
respected
and
singular
good
client
whom
he
brought
to
the
ground
meanwhile
all
those
unlucky
persons
who
had
succeeded
in
scaling
the
wall
were
attacked
by
the
hounds
and
unable
to
stand
against
them
were
chased
round
the
garden
to
the
infinite
amusement
of
the
squire
frightened
to
death
and
unable
otherwise
to
escape
for
the
gate
allowed
them
no
means
of
exit
the
poor
wretches
fled
towards
the
terrace
overlooking
pendle
water
and
leaping
into
the
stream
gained
the
opposite
bank
there
they
were
safe
for
the
hounds
were
not
allowed
to
follow
them
further
in
this
way
the
garden
was
completely
cleared
of
the
enemy
and
nicholas
and
richard
were
left
masters
of
the
field
leaning
out
of
the
window
mistress
nutter
laughingly
congratulated
them
on
their
success
and
as
no
further
disposition
was
manifested
on
the
part
of
nowell
and
such
of
his
troop
that
remained
to
renew
the
attack
the
contest
for
the
present
at
least
was
supposed
to
be
at
an
end
by
this
time
also
intimation
had
been
conveyed
by
the
deserters
from
nowell
troop
who
it
will
be
remembered
had
made
their
way
to
the
back
of
the
premises
that
they
were
anxious
to
offer
their
services
to
mistress
nutter
and
as
soon
as
this
was
told
her
she
ordered
them
to
be
admitted
and
descended
to
give
them
welcome
thus
things
wore
a
promising
aspect
for
the
besieged
while
the
assailing
party
were
proportionately
disheartened
long
ere
this
baldwyn
and
old
mitton
had
desisted
from
their
attempts
to
break
open
the
gate
and
indeed
rejoiced
that
such
a
barrier
was
interposed
between
them
and
the
hounds
whose
furious
onslaughts
they
witnessed
a
bolt
was
launched
against
these
guardians
of
the
premises
by
the
bearer
of
the
crossbow
but
the
man
proved
but
an
indifferent
marksman
for
instead
of
hitting
the
hound
he
disabled
one
of
his
companions
who
was
battling
with
him
finding
things
in
this
state
and
that
neither
nowell
nor
potts
returned
to
their
charge
while
their
followers
were
withdrawn
from
before
the
gate
nicholas
thought
he
might
fairly
infer
that
a
victory
had
been
obtained
but
like
a
prudent
leader
he
did
not
choose
to
expose
himself
till
the
enemy
had
absolutely
yielded
and
he
therefore
signed
to
blackadder
and
his
men
to
come
forth
from
the
hall
the
order
was
obeyed
not
only
by
them
but
by
the
seceders
from
the
hostile
troop
and
some
thirty
men
issued
from
the
principal
door
and
ranging
themselves
upon
the
lawn
set
up
a
deafening
and
triumphant
shout
very
different
from
that
raised
by
the
same
individuals
when
under
the
command
of
nowell
at
the
same
moment
mistress
nutter
and
alizon
appeared
at
the
door
and
at
the
sight
of
them
the
shouting
was
renewed
the
unexpected
turn
in
affairs
had
not
been
without
its
effect
upon
richard
and
alizon
and
tended
to
revive
the
spirits
of
both
the
immediate
danger
by
which
they
were
threatened
had
vanished
and
time
was
given
for
the
consideration
of
new
plans
richard
had
been
firmly
resolved
to
take
no
further
part
in
the
affray
than
should
be
required
for
the
protection
of
alizon
and
consequently
it
was
no
little
satisfaction
to
him
to
reflect
that
the
victory
had
been
accomplished
without
him
and
by
means
which
could
not
afterwards
be
questioned
meanwhile
mistress
nutter
had
joined
nicholas
and
the
gates
being
unbarred
by
blackadder
they
passed
through
them
at
a
little
distance
stood
roger
nowell
now
altogether
abandoned
except
by
his
own
immediate
followers
with
baldwyn
and
old
mitton
poor
potts
was
lying
on
the
ground
piteously
bemoaning
the
lacerations
his
skin
had
undergone
well
you
have
got
the
worst
of
it
master
nowell
said
nicholas
as
he
and
mistress
nutter
approached
the
discomfited
magistrate
and
must
own
yourself
fairly
defeated
defeated
as
i
am
i
would
rather
be
in
my
place
than
in
yours
sir
retorted
nowell
sourly
you
have
had
a
wholesome
lesson
read
you
master
nowell
said
mistress
nutter
but
i
do
not
come
hither
to
taunt
you
i
am
quite
satisfied
with
the
victory
i
have
obtained
and
am
anxious
to
put
an
end
to
the
misunderstanding
between
us
i
have
no
misunderstanding
with
you
madam
replied
nowell
i
do
not
quarrel
with
persons
like
you
but
be
assured
though
you
may
escape
now
a
day
of
reckoning
will
come
your
chief
cause
of
grievance
against
me
i
am
aware
replied
mistress
nutter
calmly
is
that
i
have
beaten
you
in
the
matter
of
the
land
now
i
have
a
proposal
to
make
to
you
respecting
it
i
can
not
listen
to
it
rejoined
nowell
sternly
i
can
have
no
dealings
with
a
witch
at
this
moment
his
cloak
was
plucked
behind
by
potts
who
looked
at
him
as
much
as
to
say
do
not
exasperate
her
hear
what
she
has
got
to
offer
i
shall
be
happy
to
act
as
mediator
between
you
if
possible
observed
nicholas
but
in
that
case
i
must
request
you
master
nowell
to
abstain
from
any
offensive
language
what
is
it
you
have
to
propose
to
me
then
madam
demanded
the
magistrate
gruffly
come
with
me
into
the
house
and
you
shall
hear
replied
mistress
nutter
nowell
was
about
to
refuse
peremptorily
when
his
cloak
was
again
plucked
by
potts
who
whispered
him
to
go
this
is
not
a
snare
laid
to
entrap
me
madam
he
said
regarding
the
lady
suspiciously
i
will
answer
for
her
good
faith
interposed
nicholas
nowell
still
hesitated
but
the
counsel
of
his
legal
adviser
was
enforced
by
a
heavy
shower
of
rain
which
just
then
began
to
descend
upon
them
you
can
take
shelter
beneath
my
roof
said
mistress
nutter
and
before
the
shower
is
over
we
can
settle
the
matter
and
my
wounds
can
be
dressed
at
the
same
time
said
potts
with
a
groan
for
they
pain
me
sorely
blackadder
has
a
sovereign
balsam
which
with
a
patch
or
two
of
diachylon
will
make
all
right
replied
nicholas
unable
to
repress
a
laugh
here
lift
him
up
between
you
he
added
to
the
grooms
and
convey
him
into
the
house
the
orders
were
obeyed
and
mistress
nutter
led
the
way
through
the
now
gates
her
slow
and
majestic
march
by
no
means
accelerated
by
the
drenching
shower
what
roger
nowell
sensations
were
at
following
her
in
such
a
way
after
his
previous
threats
and
boastings
may
be
easily
conceived
chapter
roger
nowell
and
his
double
the
magistrate
was
ushered
by
the
lady
into
a
small
chamber
opening
out
of
the
which
in
consequence
of
having
only
one
small
narrow
window
with
a
clipped
before
it
was
extremely
dark
and
gloomy
the
walls
were
covered
with
sombre
tapestry
and
on
entering
mistress
nutter
not
only
carefully
closed
the
door
but
drew
the
arras
before
it
so
as
to
prevent
the
possibility
of
their
conversation
being
heard
outside
these
precautions
taken
she
motioned
the
magistrate
to
a
chair
and
seated
herself
opposite
him
we
can
now
deal
unreservedly
with
each
other
master
nowell
she
said
fixing
her
eyes
steadily
upon
him
and
as
our
discourse
can
not
be
overheard
and
repeated
may
use
perfect
freedom
of
speech
i
am
glad
of
it
replied
nowell
because
it
will
save
circumlocution
which
i
dislike
and
therefore
before
proceeding
further
i
must
tell
you
directly
and
distinctly
that
if
there
be
aught
of
witchcraft
in
what
you
are
about
to
propose
to
me
i
will
have
nought
to
do
with
it
and
our
conference
may
as
well
never
begin
then
you
really
believe
me
to
be
a
witch
said
the
lady
i
do
replied
nowell
unflinchingly
since
you
believe
this
you
must
also
believe
that
i
have
absolute
power
over
you
rejoined
mistress
nutter
and
might
strike
you
with
sickness
cripple
you
or
kill
you
if
i
thought
fit
i
know
not
that
returned
nowell
there
are
limits
even
to
the
power
of
evil
beings
and
your
charms
and
enchantments
however
strong
and
baneful
may
be
wholly
inoperative
against
a
magistrate
in
the
discharge
of
his
duty
if
it
were
not
so
you
would
scarcely
think
it
worth
while
to
treat
with
me
humph
exclaimed
the
lady
now
tell
me
frankly
what
you
will
do
when
you
depart
hence
ride
off
with
the
utmost
speed
to
whalley
replied
nowell
and
acquainting
sir
ralph
with
all
that
has
occurred
claim
his
assistance
and
then
with
all
the
force
we
can
jointly
muster
return
hither
and
finish
the
work
i
have
left
undone
you
will
forego
this
intention
said
mistress
nutter
with
a
bitter
smile
the
magistrate
shook
his
head
i
am
not
easily
turned
from
my
purpose
he
remarked
but
you
have
not
yet
quitted
rough
lee
said
the
lady
and
after
such
an
announcement
i
shall
scarce
think
of
parting
with
you
you
dare
not
detain
me
replied
nowell
i
have
nicholas
word
for
my
security
and
i
know
he
will
not
break
it
besides
you
will
gain
nothing
by
my
detention
my
absence
will
soon
be
discovered
and
if
living
i
shall
be
set
free
if
dead
avenged
that
may
or
may
not
be
replied
mistress
nutter
and
in
any
case
i
can
if
i
choose
wreak
my
vengeance
upon
you
i
am
glad
to
have
ascertained
your
intentions
for
i
now
know
how
to
treat
with
you
you
shall
not
go
hence
except
on
certain
conditions
you
have
said
you
will
proclaim
me
a
witch
and
will
come
back
with
sufficient
force
to
accomplish
my
arrest
instead
of
doing
this
i
advise
you
to
return
to
sir
ralph
assheton
and
admit
to
him
that
you
find
yourself
in
error
in
respect
to
the
boundaries
of
the
land
never
interrupted
nowell
i
advise
you
to
do
this
pursued
the
lady
calmly
and
i
advise
you
also
on
quitting
this
room
to
retract
all
you
have
uttered
to
my
prejudice
in
the
presence
of
nicholas
assheton
and
other
credible
witnesses
in
which
case
i
will
not
only
lay
aside
all
feelings
of
animosity
towards
you
but
will
make
over
to
you
the
whole
of
the
land
under
dispute
and
that
without
purchase
money
on
your
part
roger
nowell
was
of
an
avaricious
nature
and
caught
at
the
bait
how
madam
he
cried
the
whole
of
the
land
mine
without
payment
the
whole
she
replied
if
she
should
be
arraigned
and
convicted
it
will
be
forfeited
to
the
crown
thought
nowell
the
offer
is
tempting
your
attorney
is
here
and
can
prepare
the
conveyance
at
once
pursued
mistress
nutter
a
sum
can
be
stated
to
lend
a
colour
to
the
proceeding
and
i
will
give
you
a
private
memorandum
that
i
will
not
claim
it
all
i
require
is
that
you
clear
me
completely
from
the
dark
aspersions
cast
upon
my
character
and
you
abandon
your
projects
against
my
adopted
daughter
alizon
as
well
as
against
those
two
poor
old
women
mothers
demdike
and
chattox
how
can
i
be
sure
that
i
shall
not
be
deluded
in
the
matter
asked
nowell
the
writing
may
disappear
from
the
parchment
you
give
me
or
the
parchment
itself
may
turn
to
ashes
such
things
have
occurred
in
transactions
with
witches
or
it
be
that
by
consenting
to
the
compact
i
may
imperil
my
own
soul
tush
exclaimed
mistress
nutter
these
are
idle
fears
but
it
is
no
idle
threat
on
my
part
when
i
tell
you
you
shall
not
go
forth
unless
you
consent
you
can
not
hinder
me
woman
cried
nowell
rising
you
shall
see
rejoined
the
lady
making
two
or
three
rapid
passes
before
him
which
instantly
stiffened
his
limbs
and
deprived
him
of
the
power
of
motion
now
stir
if
you
can
she
added
with
a
laugh
nowell
essayed
to
cry
out
but
his
tongue
refused
its
office
hearing
and
sight
however
were
left
him
and
he
saw
mistress
nutter
take
a
large
volume
bound
in
black
from
the
shelf
and
open
it
at
a
page
covered
with
cabalistic
characters
after
which
she
pronounced
some
words
that
sounded
like
an
invocation
as
she
concluded
the
tapestry
against
the
wall
was
raised
and
from
behind
it
appeared
a
figure
in
all
respects
resembling
the
magistrate
it
had
the
same
sharp
features
the
same
keen
eyes
and
bushy
eyebrows
the
same
stoop
in
the
shoulders
the
same
habiliments
it
was
in
short
his
double
mistress
nutter
regarded
him
with
a
look
of
triumph
since
you
refuse
with
my
injunctions
she
said
your
double
will
prove
more
tractable
he
will
go
forth
and
do
all
i
would
have
you
do
while
i
have
but
to
stamp
upon
the
floor
and
a
dungeon
will
yawn
beneath
your
feet
where
you
will
lie
immured
till
doomsday
the
same
fate
will
attend
your
crafty
associate
master
potts
so
that
neither
of
you
will
be
missed
ha
ha
the
unfortunate
magistrate
fully
comprehended
his
danger
but
he
could
now
neither
offer
remonstrance
nor
entreaty
what
was
passing
in
his
breast
seemed
known
to
mistress
nutter
for
she
motioned
the
double
to
stay
and
touching
the
brow
of
nowell
with
the
point
of
her
forefinger
instantly
restored
his
power
of
speech
i
will
give
you
a
last
chance
she
said
will
you
obey
me
now
i
must
perforce
replied
nowell
the
contest
is
too
unequal
you
may
retire
then
she
cried
to
the
double
and
stepping
backwards
the
figure
lifted
up
the
tapestry
and
disappeared
behind
it
i
can
breathe
now
that
infernal
being
is
gone
cried
nowell
sinking
into
the
chair
oh
madam
you
have
indeed
terrible
power
you
will
do
well
not
to
brave
it
again
she
rejoined
shall
i
summon
master
potts
to
prepare
the
conveyance
oh
no
no
cried
nowell
i
do
not
desire
the
land
i
will
not
have
it
i
shall
pay
too
dearly
for
it
only
let
me
get
out
of
this
horrible
place
not
so
quickly
sir
rejoined
mistress
nutter
before
you
go
hence
i
must
bind
you
to
the
performance
of
my
injunctions
pronounce
these
words
after
me
i
become
subject
to
the
fiend
if
i
fail
in
my
promise
i
will
never
utter
them
cried
nowell
shuddering
then
i
shall
recall
your
double
said
the
lady
hold
hold
exclaimed
nowell
let
me
know
what
you
require
of
me
i
require
absolute
silence
on
your
part
as
to
all
you
have
seen
and
heard
here
and
cessation
of
hostility
towards
me
and
the
persons
i
have
already
named
replied
mistress
nutter
and
i
require
a
declaration
from
you
in
the
presence
of
the
two
asshetons
that
you
are
fully
satisfied
of
the
justice
of
my
claims
in
respect
to
the
land
and
that
mortified
by
your
defeat
you
have
brought
a
false
charge
against
me
which
you
now
sincerely
regret
this
i
require
from
you
and
you
must
ratify
the
promise
by
the
abjuration
i
have
proposed
i
become
subject
to
the
fiend
if
i
fail
in
my
promise
the
magistrate
repeated
the
words
after
her
as
he
finished
mocking
laughter
apparently
resounding
from
below
smote
his
ears
enough
cried
mistress
nutter
triumphantly
and
now
take
good
heed
that
you
swerve
not
in
the
slightest
degree
from
your
word
or
you
are
for
ever
lost
again
the
mocking
laughter
was
heard
and
nowell
would
have
rushed
forth
if
mistress
nutter
had
not
withheld
him
stay
she
cried
i
have
not
done
with
you
yet
my
witnesses
must
hear
your
declaration
remember
and
placing
her
finger
upon
her
lips
in
token
of
silence
she
stepped
backwards
drew
aside
the
tapestry
and
opening
the
door
called
to
the
two
asshetons
both
of
whom
instantly
came
to
her
and
were
not
a
little
surprised
to
learn
that
all
differences
had
been
adjusted
and
that
roger
nowell
acknowledged
himself
entirely
in
error
retracting
all
the
charges
he
had
brought
against
her
while
on
her
part
she
was
fully
satisfied
with
his
explanations
and
apologies
and
promised
not
to
entertain
any
feelings
of
resentment
towards
him
you
have
made
up
the
matter
indeed
cried
nicholas
and
as
master
roger
nowell
is
a
widower
perhaps
a
match
may
come
of
it
such
an
arrangement
this
is
no
occasion
for
jesting
nicholas
interrupted
the
lady
sharply
nay
i
but
threw
out
a
hint
rejoined
the
squire
it
would
set
the
question
of
the
land
for
ever
at
rest
it
is
set
at
rest
for
ever
replied
the
lady
with
a
side
look
at
the
magistrate
i
become
subject
to
the
fiend
if
i
fail
in
my
promise
repeated
nowell
to
himself
those
words
bind
me
like
a
chain
of
iron
i
must
get
out
of
this
accursed
house
as
fast
as
i
can
as
if
his
thoughts
had
been
divined
by
mistress
nutter
she
here
observed
to
him
to
make
our
reconciliation
complete
master
nowell
i
must
entreat
you
to
pass
the
day
with
me
i
will
give
you
the
best
entertainment
my
house
affords
nay
i
will
take
no
denial
and
you
too
nicholas
and
you
richard
you
will
stay
and
keep
the
worthy
magistrate
company
the
two
asshetons
willingly
assented
but
roger
nowell
would
fain
have
been
excused
a
look
however
from
his
hostess
enforced
compliance
the
proposal
will
be
highly
agreeable
i
am
sure
to
master
potts
remarked
nicholas
with
a
laugh
for
though
much
better
in
consequence
of
the
balsam
applied
by
blackadder
he
is
scarcely
in
condition
for
the
saddle
i
will
warrant
him
well
morning
said
mistress
nutter
where
is
he
inquired
nowell
in
the
library
with
parson
holden
replied
nicholas
making
himself
as
comfortable
as
circumstances
will
permit
with
a
flask
of
rhenish
before
him
i
will
go
to
him
then
said
nowell
take
care
what
you
say
to
him
observed
mistress
nutter
in
a
low
tone
and
raising
her
finger
to
her
lips
heaving
a
deep
sigh
the
magistrate
then
repaired
to
the
library
a
small
room
panelled
with
black
oak
and
furnished
with
a
few
cases
of
ancient
tomes
the
attorney
and
the
divine
were
seated
at
a
table
with
a
big
bottle
and
glasses
before
them
and
master
potts
with
a
wry
grimace
excused
himself
from
rising
on
his
respected
and
singular
good
client
approach
do
not
disturb
yourself
said
nowell
gruffly
we
shall
not
leave
rough
lee
i
am
glad
to
hear
it
replied
potts
moving
the
cushions
on
his
chair
and
eyeing
the
bottle
affectionately
nor
it
may
be
nor
the
day
after
nor
at
all
possibly
said
nowell
indeed
exclaimed
potts
starting
and
wincing
with
pain
what
is
the
meaning
of
all
this
worthy
sir
i
become
the
subject
of
the
fiend
if
i
fail
in
my
promise
rejoined
nowell
with
a
groan
what
promise
worshipful
sir
cried
potts
staring
with
surprise
the
magistrate
got
out
the
words
my
promise
to
and
then
he
stopped
suddenly
to
mistress
nutter
suggested
potts
do
ask
me
exclaimed
nowell
fiercely
do
draw
any
erroneous
conclusions
man
i
mean
nothing
i
say
nothing
he
is
certainly
bewitched
observed
parson
holden
in
an
to
the
attorney
it
was
by
your
advice
i
entered
this
house
thundered
nowell
and
may
all
the
ill
arising
from
it
alight
upon
your
head
my
respected
client
implored
potts
i
am
no
longer
your
client
shrieked
the
infuriated
magistrate
i
dismiss
you
i
will
have
nought
to
do
with
you
more
i
wish
i
had
never
seen
your
ugly
little
face
you
were
quite
right
reverend
sir
observed
potts
aside
to
the
divine
he
is
certainly
bewitched
or
he
never
would
behave
in
this
way
to
his
best
friend
my
excellent
sir
he
added
to
nowell
i
beseech
you
to
calm
yourself
and
listen
to
me
my
motive
for
wishing
you
to
comply
with
mistress
nutter
request
was
this
we
were
in
a
dilemma
from
which
there
was
no
escape
my
wounded
condition
preventing
me
from
flight
and
all
your
followers
being
dispersed
knowing
your
discretion
i
apprehended
that
finding
the
tables
turned
against
you
you
would
not
desire
to
play
a
losing
game
and
i
therefore
counselled
apparent
submission
as
the
best
means
of
disarming
your
antagonist
whatever
arrangement
you
have
made
with
mistress
nutter
is
neither
morally
nor
legally
binding
upon
you
you
think
not
cried
nowell
i
become
subject
to
the
fiend
if
i
violate
my
promise
what
promise
have
you
made
sir
inquired
potts
and
holden
together
do
not
question
me
cried
nowell
it
is
sufficient
that
i
am
tied
and
bound
by
it
the
attorney
reflected
a
little
and
then
observed
to
holden
it
is
evident
some
unfair
practices
have
been
resorted
to
with
our
respected
friend
to
extort
a
promise
from
him
which
he
can
not
violate
it
is
also
possible
from
what
he
let
fall
at
first
that
an
attempt
may
be
made
to
detain
us
prisoners
within
this
house
and
for
aught
i
know
master
nowell
may
have
given
his
word
not
to
go
forth
without
mistress
permission
under
these
circumstances
i
would
beg
of
you
reverend
sir
as
an
especial
favour
to
us
both
to
ride
over
to
whalley
and
acquaint
sir
ralph
assheton
with
our
situation
as
this
suggestion
was
made
nowell
countenance
brightened
up
the
expression
was
not
lost
upon
the
attorney
who
perceived
he
was
on
the
right
tack
tell
the
worthy
baronet
continued
potts
that
his
old
and
esteemed
friend
master
roger
nowell
is
in
great
jeopardy
am
i
not
right
sir
the
magistrate
nodded
tell
him
he
is
forcibly
detained
a
prisoner
and
requires
sufficient
force
to
effect
his
immediate
liberation
tell
him
also
that
master
nowell
charges
mistress
nutter
with
robbing
him
of
his
land
by
witchcraft
no
no
interrupted
nowell
do
not
tell
him
that
i
no
longer
charge
her
with
it
then
tell
him
that
i
do
cried
potts
and
that
master
nowell
has
strangely
very
strangely
altered
his
mind
i
become
subject
to
the
fiend
if
i
violate
my
promise
said
the
magistrate
ay
tell
him
that
cried
the
attorney
tell
him
the
worthy
gentleman
is
constantly
repeating
that
sentence
it
will
explain
all
and
now
reverend
sir
let
me
entreat
you
to
set
out
without
delay
or
your
departure
may
be
prevented
i
will
go
at
once
said
holden
as
he
was
about
to
quit
the
apartment
mistress
nutter
appeared
at
the
door
confusion
was
painted
on
the
countenances
of
all
three
whither
go
you
sir
demanded
the
lady
sharply
on
a
mission
which
can
not
be
delayed
madam
replied
holden
you
can
not
quit
my
house
at
present
she
rejoined
peremptorily
these
gentlemen
stay
to
dine
with
me
and
i
can
not
dispense
with
your
company
my
duty
calls
me
hence
returned
the
divine
with
all
thanks
for
your
proffered
hospitality
i
must
perforce
decline
it
not
when
i
command
you
to
stay
she
rejoined
raising
her
hand
i
am
absolute
mistress
here
not
over
the
servants
of
heaven
madam
replied
the
divine
taking
a
bible
from
his
pocket
and
placing
it
before
him
by
this
sacred
volume
i
shield
myself
against
your
spells
and
command
you
to
let
me
pass
and
as
he
went
forth
mistress
nutter
unable
to
oppose
him
shrank
back
chapter
mother
demdike
the
heavy
rain
which
began
to
fall
as
roger
nowell
entered
rough
lee
had
now
ceased
and
the
sun
shone
forth
again
brilliantly
making
the
garden
look
so
fresh
and
beautiful
that
richard
proposed
a
stroll
within
it
to
alizon
the
young
girl
seemed
doubtful
at
first
whether
to
comply
with
the
invitation
but
she
finally
assented
and
they
went
forth
together
alone
for
nicholas
fancying
they
could
dispense
with
his
company
only
attended
them
as
far
as
the
door
where
he
remained
looking
after
them
laughing
to
himself
and
wondering
how
matters
would
end
no
good
will
come
of
it
i
fear
mused
the
worthy
squire
shaking
his
head
and
i
am
scarcely
doing
right
in
allowing
dick
to
entangle
himself
in
this
fashion
but
where
is
the
use
of
giving
advice
to
a
young
man
who
is
over
head
and
ears
in
love
he
will
never
listen
to
it
and
will
only
resent
interference
dick
must
take
his
chance
i
have
already
pointed
out
the
danger
to
him
and
if
he
chooses
to
run
headlong
into
the
pit
why
i
can
not
hinder
him
after
all
i
am
not
much
surprised
alizon
beauty
is
quite
irresistible
and
were
all
smooth
and
straightforward
in
her
history
there
could
be
no
reason
why
pshaw
i
am
as
foolish
as
the
lad
himself
sir
richard
assheton
the
proudest
man
in
the
shire
would
disown
his
son
if
he
married
against
his
inclinations
no
my
pretty
youthful
pair
since
nothing
but
misery
awaits
you
i
advise
you
to
make
the
most
of
your
brief
season
of
happiness
i
should
certainly
do
so
were
the
case
my
own
meanwhile
the
objects
of
these
ruminations
had
reached
the
terrace
overlooking
pendle
water
and
were
pacing
slowly
backwards
and
forwards
along
it
one
might
be
very
happy
in
this
sequestered
spot
alizon
observed
richard
to
some
persons
it
might
appear
dull
but
to
me
if
blessed
with
you
it
would
be
little
short
of
paradise
alas
richard
she
replied
forcing
a
smile
why
conjure
up
visions
of
happiness
which
never
can
be
realised
but
even
with
you
i
do
not
think
i
could
be
happy
here
there
is
something
about
the
house
which
when
i
first
beheld
it
filled
me
with
unaccountable
terror
never
since
i
was
a
mere
infant
have
i
been
within
it
till
and
yet
it
was
quite
familiar
to
me
horribly
familiar
i
knew
the
hall
in
which
we
stood
together
with
its
huge
arched
fireplace
and
the
armorial
bearings
upon
it
and
could
point
out
the
stone
on
which
were
carved
my
father
initials
with
the
date
i
knew
the
tapestry
on
the
walls
and
the
painted
glass
in
the
long
range
windows
i
knew
the
old
oak
staircase
and
the
gallery
beyond
it
and
the
room
to
which
my
mother
led
me
i
knew
the
portraits
painted
on
the
panels
and
at
once
recognised
my
father
i
knew
the
great
carved
oak
bedstead
in
this
room
and
the
high
and
the
raised
hearthstone
and
shuddered
as
i
gazed
at
it
you
will
ask
me
how
these
things
could
be
familiar
to
me
i
will
tell
you
i
had
seen
them
repeatedly
in
my
dreams
they
have
haunted
me
for
years
but
i
only
knew
they
had
an
actual
existence
or
were
in
any
way
connected
with
my
own
history
the
sight
of
that
house
inspired
me
with
a
horror
i
have
not
been
able
to
overcome
and
i
have
a
presentiment
that
some
ill
will
befall
me
within
it
i
would
never
willingly
dwell
there
the
warning
voice
within
you
which
should
never
be
despised
prompts
you
to
quit
it
cried
richard
and
i
also
urge
you
in
like
manner
in
vain
sighed
alizon
this
terrace
is
beautiful
she
added
as
they
resumed
their
walk
and
i
shall
often
come
hither
if
i
am
permitted
at
sunset
this
river
and
the
woody
heights
above
it
must
be
enchanting
and
i
do
not
dislike
the
savage
character
of
the
surrounding
scenery
it
enhances
by
contrast
the
beauty
of
this
solitude
i
only
wish
the
spot
commanded
a
view
of
pendle
hill
you
are
like
my
cousin
nicholas
who
thinks
no
prospect
complete
unless
that
hill
forms
part
of
it
said
richard
but
since
i
find
that
you
will
often
come
hither
at
sunset
i
shall
not
despair
of
seeing
and
conversing
with
you
again
even
if
i
am
forbidden
the
house
by
mistress
nutter
that
thicket
is
an
excellent
and
this
stream
is
easily
crossed
we
can
have
no
secret
interviews
richard
replied
alizon
i
shall
come
hither
to
think
of
you
but
not
to
meet
you
you
must
never
return
to
rough
lee
again
that
is
not
unless
some
change
takes
place
which
i
dare
not
anticipate
but
hist
i
am
called
i
must
go
back
to
the
house
the
voice
came
from
the
other
side
of
the
river
said
richard
and
hark
it
calls
again
who
can
it
be
it
is
jennet
replied
alizon
i
see
her
now
and
she
pointed
out
the
little
girl
standing
beside
an
alder
on
the
opposite
bank
yo
didna
notice
me
efore
alizon
cried
jennet
in
her
sharp
tone
and
with
her
customary
provoking
laugh

jennet

not

asked
the
child
on
no
account
whispered
richard
do
not
let
her
anger
the
old
hag
speak
jennet
said
alizon
in
a
tone
of
kind
persuasion
ey
shanna

onless

replied
the
little
girl
an
whot
ey
ha
to
tell
consarns
ye
mitch
i
can
easily
cross
observed
alizon
to
richard
those
stones
seem
placed
on
purpose
upon
this
descending
from
the
terrace
to
the
river
brink
and
springing
lightly
upon
the
first
stone
which
reared
its
head
above
the
foaming
tide
she
bounded
to
another
and
so
in
an
instant
was
across
the
stream
richard
saw
her
ascend
the
opposite
bank
and
approach
jennet
who
withdrew
behind
the
alder
and
then
he
fancied
he
perceived
an
old
beldame
partly
concealed
by
the
intervening
branches
of
the
tree
advance
and
seize
hold
of
her
then
there
was
a
scream
and
the
sound
had
scarcely
reached
the
young
man
ears
before
he
was
down
the
bank
and
across
the
river
but
when
he
reached
the
alder
neither
alizon
nor
jennet
nor
the
old
beldame
were
to
be
seen
the
terrible
conviction
that
she
had
been
carried
off
by
mother
demdike
then
smote
him
and
though
he
continued
his
search
for
her
among
the
adjoining
bushes
it
was
with
fearful
misgivings
no
answer
was
returned
to
his
shouts
nor
could
he
discover
any
trace
of
the
means
by
which
alizon
had
been
spirited
away
after
some
time
spent
in
ineffectual
search
uncertain
what
course
to
pursue
and
with
a
heart
full
of
despair
richard
crossed
the
river
and
proceeded
towards
the
house
in
front
of
which
he
found
mistress
nutter
and
nicholas
both
of
whom
seemed
surprised
when
they
perceived
he
was
unaccompanied
by
alizon
the
lady
immediately
and
somewhat
sharply
questioned
him
as
to
what
had
become
of
her
adopted
daughter
and
appeared
at
first
to
doubt
his
answer
but
at
length
unable
to
question
his
sincerity
she
became
violently
agitated
the
poor
girl
has
been
conveyed
away
by
mother
demdike
she
cried
though
for
what
purpose
i
am
at
a
loss
to
conceive
the
old
hag
could
not
cross
the
running
water
and
therefore
resorted
to
that
stratagem
alizon
must
not
be
left
in
her
hands
madam
said
richard
she
must
not
replied
the
lady
if
blackadder
whom
i
have
sent
after
parson
holden
were
here
i
would
despatch
him
instantly
to
malkin
tower
i
will
go
instead
said
richard
you
had
better
accept
his
offer
interposed
nicholas
he
will
serve
you
as
well
as
blackadder
go
i
shall
madam
cried
richard
if
not
on
your
account
on
my
own
come
then
with
me
said
the
lady
entering
the
house
and
i
will
furnish
you
with
that
which
shall
be
your
safeguard
in
the
enterprise
with
this
she
proceeded
to
the
closet
where
her
interview
with
roger
nowell
had
been
held
and
unlocking
an
ebony
cabinet
took
from
a
drawer
within
it
a
small
flat
piece
of
gold
graven
with
mystic
characters
and
having
a
slender
chain
of
the
same
metal
attached
to
it
throwing
the
chain
over
richard
neck
she
said
place
this
talisman
which
is
of
sovereign
virtue
near
your
heart
and
no
witchcraft
shall
have
power
over
you
but
be
careful
that
you
are
not
by
any
artifice
deprived
of
it
for
the
old
hag
will
soon
discover
that
you
possess
some
charm
to
protect
you
against
her
spells
you
are
impatient
to
be
gone
but
i
have
not
yet
done
she
continued
taking
down
a
small
silver
bugle
from
a
hook
and
giving
it
him
on
reaching
malkin
tower
wind
this
horn
thrice
and
the
old
witch
will
appear
at
the
upper
window
demand
admittance
in
my
name
and
she
will
not
dare
to
refuse
you
or
if
she
does
tell
her
you
know
the
secret
entrance
to
her
stronghold
and
will
have
recourse
to
it
and
in
case
this
should
be
needful
i
will
now
disclose
it
to
you
but
you
must
not
use
it
till
other
means
fail
when
opposite
the
door
which
you
will
find
is
high
up
in
the
building
take
ten
paces
to
the
left
and
if
you
examine
the
masonry
at
the
foot
of
the
tower
you
will
perceive
one
stone
somewhat
darker
than
the
rest
at
the
bottom
of
this
stone
and
concealed
by
a
patch
of
heath
you
will
discover
a
knob
of
iron
touch
it
and
it
will
give
you
an
opening
to
a
vaulted
chamber
whence
you
can
mount
to
the
upper
room
even
then
you
may
experience
some
difficulty
but
with
resolution
you
will
surmount
all
obstacles
i
have
no
fear
of
success
madam
replied
richard
confidently
and
quitting
her
he
proceeded
to
the
stables
and
calling
for
his
horse
vaulted
into
the
saddle
and
galloped
off
towards
the
bridge
fast
as
richard
rode
up
the
steep
still
faster
did
the
black
clouds
gather
over
his
head
no
natural
cause
could
have
produced
so
instantaneous
a
change
in
the
aspect
of
the
sky
and
the
young
man
viewed
it
with
uneasiness
and
wished
to
get
out
of
the
thicket
in
which
he
was
now
involved
before
the
threatened
commenced
but
the
hill
was
steep
and
the
road
bad
being
full
of
loose
stones
and
crossed
in
many
places
by
bare
roots
of
trees
though
ordinarily
surefooted
merlin
stumbled
frequently
and
richard
was
obliged
to
slacken
his
pace
it
grew
darker
and
darker
and
the
storm
seemed
ready
to
burst
upon
him
the
smaller
birds
ceased
singing
and
screened
themselves
under
the
thickest
foliage
the
pie
chattered
incessantly
the
jay
screamed
the
bittern
flew
past
booming
heavily
in
the
air
the
raven
croaked
the
heron
arose
from
the
river
and
speeded
off
with
his
long
neck
stretched
out
and
the
falcon
who
had
been
hovering
over
him
sweeped
sidelong
down
and
sought
shelter
beneath
an
impending
rock
the
rabbit
scudded
off
to
his
burrow
in
the
brake
and
the
hare
erecting
himself
for
a
moment
as
if
to
listen
to
the
note
of
danger
crept
timorously
off
into
the
long
dry
grass
it
grew
so
dark
at
last
that
the
road
was
difficult
to
discern
and
the
dense
rows
of
trees
on
either
side
assumed
a
fantastic
appearance
in
the
deep
gloom
richard
was
now
more
than
up
the
hill
and
the
thicket
had
become
more
tangled
and
intricate
and
the
road
narrower
and
more
rugged
all
at
once
merlin
stopped
quivering
in
every
limb
as
if
in
extremity
of
terror
before
the
rider
and
right
in
his
path
glared
a
pair
of
red
fiery
orbs
with
something
dusky
and
obscure
linked
to
them
but
whether
of
man
or
beast
he
could
not
distinguish
richard
called
to
it
no
answer
he
struck
spurs
into
the
reeking
flanks
of
his
horse
the
animal
refused
to
stir
just
then
there
was
a
moaning
sound
in
the
wood
as
of
some
one
in
pain
he
turned
in
the
direction
shouted
but
received
no
answer
when
he
looked
back
the
red
eyes
were
gone
then
merlin
moved
forward
of
his
own
accord
but
ere
he
had
gone
far
the
eyes
were
visible
again
glaring
at
the
rider
from
the
wood
this
time
they
approached
dilating
and
increasing
in
glowing
intensity
till
they
scorched
him
like
bethinking
him
of
the
talisman
richard
drew
it
forth
the
light
was
instantly
extinguished
and
the
indistinct
figure
accompanying
it
melted
into
darkness
once
more
merlin
resumed
his
toilsome
way
and
richard
was
marvelling
that
the
storm
so
long
suspended
its
fury
when
the
sky
was
riven
by
a
sudden
blaze
and
a
crackling
bolt
shot
down
and
struck
the
earth
at
his
feet
the
affrighted
steed
reared
aloft
and
was
with
difficulty
prevented
from
falling
backwards
upon
his
rider
almost
before
he
could
be
brought
to
his
feet
an
awful
peal
of
thunder
burst
overhead
and
it
required
richard
utmost
efforts
to
prevent
him
from
rushing
madly
down
the
hill
the
storm
had
now
fairly
commenced
flash
followed
flash
and
peal
succeeded
peal
without
intermission
the
rain
descended
hissing
and
spouting
and
presently
ran
down
the
hill
in
a
torrent
adding
to
the
horseman
other
difficulties
and
dangers
to
heighten
the
terror
of
the
scene
strange
shapes
revealed
by
the
lightning
were
seen
flitting
among
the
trees
and
strange
sounds
were
heard
though
overpowered
by
the
dreadful
rolling
of
the
thunder
but
richard
resolution
continued
unshaken
and
he
forced
merlin
on
he
had
not
proceeded
far
however
when
the
animal
uttered
a
cry
of
fright
and
began
beating
the
air
with
his
fore
hoofs
the
lightning
enabled
richard
to
discern
the
cause
of
this
new
distress
coiled
round
the
poor
beast
legs
all
whose
efforts
to
disengage
himself
from
the
terrible
assailant
were
ineffectual
was
a
large
black
snake
seemingly
about
to
plunge
its
poisonous
fangs
into
the
flesh
again
having
recourse
to
the
talisman
and
bending
down
richard
stretched
it
towards
the
snake
upon
which
the
reptile
instantly
darted
its
head
against
him
but
instead
of
wounding
him
its
forked
teeth
encountered
the
piece
of
gold
and
as
if
stricken
a
violent
blow
it
swiftly
untwined
itself
and
fled
hissing
into
the
thicket
richard
was
now
obliged
to
dismount
and
lead
his
horse
in
this
way
he
toiled
slowly
up
the
hill
the
storm
continued
with
unabated
fury
the
red
lightning
played
around
him
the
brattling
thunder
stunned
him
and
the
pelting
rain
poured
down
upon
his
head
but
he
was
no
more
molested
save
for
the
vivid
flashes
it
had
become
dark
as
night
but
they
served
to
guide
him
on
his
way
at
length
he
got
out
of
the
thicket
and
trod
upon
the
turf
but
it
was
rendered
so
slippery
by
moisture
that
he
could
scarcely
keep
his
feet
while
the
lightning
no
longer
aided
him
fearing
he
had
taken
a
wrong
course
he
stood
still
and
while
debating
with
himself
a
blaze
of
light
illumined
the
wide
heath
and
showed
him
the
object
of
his
search
malkin
tower
standing
alone
like
a
beacon
at
about
a
quarter
of
a
mile
distance
on
the
further
side
of
the
hill
was
it
disturbed
fancy
or
did
he
really
behold
on
the
summit
of
the
structure
a
grisly
shape
resembling
if
it
resembled
any
thing
human
a
gigantic
black
cat
with
roughened
staring
skin
and
flaming
eyeballs
nerved
by
the
sight
of
the
tower
richard
was
on
his
steed
back
in
an
instant
and
the
animal
having
in
some
degree
recovered
his
spirits
galloped
off
with
him
and
kept
his
feet
in
spite
of
the
slippery
state
of
the
road
erelong
another
flash
showed
the
young
man
that
he
was
drawing
rapidly
near
the
tower
and
dismounting
he
tied
merlin
to
a
tree
and
hurried
towards
the
unhallowed
pile
when
within
twenty
paces
of
it
mindful
of
mistress
nutter
injunctions
he
placed
the
bugle
to
his
lips
and
winded
it
thrice
the
summons
though
clear
and
loud
sounded
strangely
in
the
portentous
silence
scarcely
had
the
last
notes
died
away
when
a
light
shone
through
the
dark
red
curtains
hanging
before
a
casement
in
the
upper
part
of
the
tower
the
next
moment
these
were
drawn
aside
and
a
face
appeared
so
frightful
so
charged
with
infernal
wickedness
and
malice
that
richard
blood
grew
chill
at
the
sight
was
it
man
or
woman
the
white
beard
and
the
large
broad
masculine
character
of
the
countenance
seemed
to
denote
the
former
but
the
garb
was
that
of
a
female
the
face
was
at
once
hideous
and
fantastic
the
eyes
set
across
the
mouth
awry
the
right
cheek
marked
by
a
mole
shining
with
black
hair
and
horrible
from
its
contrast
to
the
rest
of
the
visage
and
the
brow
branded
as
if
by
a
streak
of
blood
a
black
thrum
cap
constituted
the
old
witch
and
from
beneath
it
her
hoary
hair
escaped
in
long
the
lower
part
of
her
person
was
hidden
from
view
but
she
appeared
to
be
as
as
a
man
and
her
bulky
person
was
wrapped
in
a
robe
throwing
open
the
window
she
looked
forth
and
demanded
in
harsh
imperious
tones
who
dares
to
summon
mother
demdike
a
messenger
from
mistress
nutter
replied
richard
i
am
come
in
her
name
to
demand
the
restitution
of
alizon
device
whom
thou
hast
forcibly
and
wrongfully
taken
from
her
alizon
device
is
my
and
as
such
belongs
to
me
and
not
to
mistress
nutter
rejoined
mother
demdike
thou
knowest
thou
speakest
false
foul
hag
cried
richard
alizon
is
no
blood
of
thine
open
the
door
and
cast
down
the
ladder
or
i
will
find
other
means
of
entrance
try
them
then
rejoined
mother
demdike
and
she
closed
the
casement
sharply
and
drew
the
curtains
over
it
after
reconnoitring
the
building
for
a
moment
richard
moved
quickly
to
the
left
and
counting
ten
paces
as
directed
by
mistress
nutter
began
to
search
among
the
thick
grass
growing
near
the
base
of
the
tower
for
the
concealed
entrance
it
was
too
dark
to
distinguish
any
difference
in
the
colour
of
the
masonry
but
he
was
sure
he
could
not
be
far
wrong
and
presently
his
hand
came
in
contact
with
a
knob
of
iron
he
pressed
it
but
it
did
not
yield
to
the
touch
again
more
forcibly
but
with
like
ill
success
could
he
be
mistaken
he
tried
the
next
stone
and
discovered
another
knob
upon
it
but
this
was
as
immovable
as
the
first
he
went
on
and
then
found
that
each
stone
was
alike
and
that
if
amongst
the
number
he
had
chanced
upon
the
one
worked
by
the
secret
spring
it
had
refused
to
act
on
examining
the
structure
so
far
as
he
was
able
to
do
in
the
gloom
he
found
he
had
described
the
whole
circle
of
the
tower
and
was
about
to
commence
the
search
anew
when
a
creaking
sound
was
heard
above
and
a
light
streamed
suddenly
down
upon
him
the
door
had
been
opened
by
the
old
witch
and
she
stood
there
with
a
lamp
in
her
hand
its
yellow
flame
illumining
her
hideous
visage
and
short
square
powerfully
built
frame
her
throat
was
like
that
of
a
bull
her
hands
of
extraordinary
size
and
her
arms
which
were
bare
to
the
shoulder
brawny
and
muscular
what
still
outside
she
cried
in
a
jeering
tone
and
with
a
wild
discordant
laugh
methought
thou
affirmedst
thou
couldst
find
a
way
into
my
dwelling
i
do
not
yet
despair
of
finding
it
replied
richard
fool
screamed
the
hag
i
tell
thee
it
is
in
vain
to
attempt
it
without
my
consent
with
a
word
i
could
make
these
walls
one
solid
mass
without
window
or
outlet
from
base
to
summit
with
a
word
i
could
shower
stones
upon
thy
head
and
crush
thee
to
dust
with
a
word
i
could
make
the
earth
swallow
thee
up
with
a
word
i
could
whisk
thee
hence
to
the
top
of
pendle
hill
ha
ha
dost
fear
me
now
no
replied
richard
undauntedly
and
the
word
thou
menacest
me
with
shall
never
be
uttered
why
not
asked
mother
demdike
derisively
because
thou
wouldst
not
brave
the
resentment
of
one
whose
power
is
equal
to
thine
own
if
not
greater
replied
the
young
man
greater
it
is
not
neither
equal
rejoined
the
old
hag
haughtily
but
i
do
not
desire
a
quarrel
with
alice
nutter
only
let
her
not
meddle
with
me
once
more
art
thou
willing
to
admit
me
demanded
richard
ay
upon
one
condition
replied
mother
demdike
thou
shalt
learn
it
anon
stand
aside
while
i
let
down
the
ladder
richard
obeyed
and
a
pair
of
narrow
wooden
steps
dropped
to
the
ground
now
mount
if
thou
hast
the
courage
cried
the
hag
the
young
man
was
instantly
beside
her
but
she
stood
in
the
doorway
and
barred
his
further
progress
with
her
extended
staff
now
that
he
was
face
to
face
with
her
he
wondered
at
his
own
temerity
there
was
nothing
human
in
her
countenance
and
infernal
light
gleamed
in
her
eyes
her
personal
strength
evidently
unimpaired
by
age
or
preserved
by
magical
art
seemed
equal
to
her
malice
and
she
appeared
as
capable
of
executing
any
atrocity
as
of
conceiving
it
she
saw
the
effect
produced
upon
him
and
chuckled
with
malicious
satisfaction
thou
ever
face
like
mine
she
cried
no
i
wot
not
but
i
would
rather
inspire
aversion
and
terror
than
love
love
foh
i
would
rather
see
men
shrink
from
me
and
shudder
at
my
approach
than
smile
upon
me
and
court
me
i
would
rather
freeze
the
blood
in
their
veins
than
set
it
boiling
with
passion
ho
ho
thou
art
a
fearful
being
indeed
exclaimed
richard
appalled
fearful
am
i
ejaculated
the
old
witch
with
renewed
laughter
at
last
thou
it
why
ay
i
fearful
it
is
my
wish
to
be
so
i
live
to
plague
mankind
to
blight
and
blast
them
to
scare
them
with
my
looks
to
work
them
mischief
ho
ho
and
now
let
us
look
at
thee
she
continued
holding
the
lamp
over
him
why
soh
a
comely
youth
and
the
young
maids
doat
upon
thee
i
doubt
not
and
praise
thy
blooming
cheeks
thy
bright
eyes
thy
flowing
locks
and
thy
fine
limbs
i
hate
thy
beauty
boy
and
would
mar
it
would
canker
thy
wholesome
flesh
dim
thy
lustrous
eyes
and
strike
thy
vigorous
limbs
with
palsy
till
they
should
shake
like
mine
i
am
to
do
it
she
added
raising
her
staff
and
glaring
at
him
with
inconceivable
malignity
hold
exclaimed
richard
taking
the
talisman
from
his
breast
and
displaying
it
to
her
i
am
armed
against
thy
malice
mother
demdike
staff
fell
from
her
grasp
i
knew
thou
wert
in
some
way
protected
she
cried
furiously
and
so
it
is
a
piece
of
gold
with
magic
characters
upon
it
eh
she
added
suddenly
changing
her
tone
let
me
look
at
it
thou
seest
it
plain
enough
rejoined
richard
now
stand
aside
and
let
me
pass
for
thou
perceivest
i
have
power
to
force
an
entrance
i
see
it
i
see
it
replied
mother
demdike
with
affected
humility
i
see
it
is
in
vain
to
struggle
with
thee
or
rather
with
the
potent
lady
who
sent
thee
tarry
where
thou
art
and
i
will
bring
alizon
to
thee
i
almost
mistrust
thee
said
richard
but
be
speedy
i
will
be
scarce
a
moment
said
the
witch
but
i
must
warn
thee
that
she
is
what
what
hast
thou
done
to
her
thou
wicked
hag
cried
richard
in
alarm
she
is
distraught
said
mother
demdike
distraught
echoed
richard
but
thou
canst
easily
cure
her
said
the
old
hag
significantly
ay
so
i
can
cried
richard
with
sudden
joy
the
talisman
bring
her
to
me
at
once
mother
demdike
departed
leaving
him
in
a
state
of
indescribable
agitation
the
walls
of
the
tower
were
of
immense
thickness
and
the
entrance
to
the
chamber
towards
which
the
arched
doorway
led
was
covered
by
a
curtain
of
old
arras
behind
which
the
hag
had
disappeared
scarcely
had
she
entered
the
room
when
a
scream
was
heard
and
richard
heard
his
own
name
pronounced
by
a
voice
which
in
spite
of
its
agonised
tones
he
at
once
recognised
the
cries
were
repeated
and
he
then
heard
mother
demdike
call
out
come
hither
come
hither
instantly
rushing
forward
and
dashing
aside
the
tapestry
he
found
himself
in
a
circular
chamber
with
a
massive
oak
table
in
the
midst
of
it
there
were
many
strange
objects
in
the
room
but
he
saw
only
alizon
who
was
struggling
with
the
old
witch
and
clinging
desperately
to
the
table
he
called
to
her
by
name
as
he
advanced
but
her
bewildered
looks
proved
that
she
did
not
know
him
alizon
dear
alizon
i
am
come
to
free
you
he
exclaimed
but
in
place
of
answering
him
she
uttered
a
piercing
scream
the
talisman
the
talisman
cried
the
hag
i
can
not
undo
my
own
work
place
the
chain
round
her
neck
and
the
gold
near
her
heart
that
she
may
experience
its
full
virtue
richard
unsuspectingly
complied
with
the
suggestion
of
the
temptress
but
the
moment
he
had
parted
with
the
piece
of
gold
the
figure
of
alizon
vanished
the
chamber
was
buried
in
gloom
and
amidst
a
hubbub
of
wild
laughter
he
was
dragged
by
the
powerful
arm
of
the
witch
through
the
arched
doorway
and
flung
from
it
to
the
ground
the
shock
of
the
fall
producing
immediate
insensibility
chapter
the
mysteries
of
malkin
tower
it
was
a
subterranean
chamber
gloomy
and
of
vast
extent
the
roof
low
and
supported
by
nine
ponderous
stone
columns
to
which
rings
and
rusty
chains
were
attached
still
retaining
the
mouldering
bones
of

they
had
held
captive
in

amongst

was
a
gigantic
skeleton
quite
entire
with
an
iron
girdle

the

fragments
of
mortality

elsewhere
scattered
about
showing
the
numbers

had
perished
in
the
place
on
either
side
were
cells
closed
by
massive
doors
secured
by

and
locks
at
one
end
were
three
immense
coffers
made
of
oak
hooped
with
iron
and
fastened
by
large
padlocks
near
them
stood
a
large
armoury
likewise
of
oak
and
sculptured
with
the
ensigns
of

abbey
proving
it
had
once
belonged
to
that
establishment
probably
it
had
been
carried
off

at
the

end
of

were
two
niches
each
occupied
by
a
statue
the
one
representing
a
warlike
figure
with
a

of
extraordinary
ferocity
and
the
other
an
anchoress
in
her
hood
and

with
a
rosary
in
her
hand
on

beneath
lay
a

of
which
stood
an
altar
and
near
it
a

caldron
in

elevated
on
a
block
of

wrought
in

human
but
the
beard
that
of
a
goat
while
the
feet
and
lower
limbs
were
like
those
of
the
same
animal
two
curled
horns
grew
behind
the
ears
and
a
third
shaped
like
a
conch
sprang
from
the
centre
of
the
forehead
from
which
burst
a
blue
flame
throwing
a
ghastly
light
on
the
objects
surrounding
it
the
only
discernible
approach
to
the
vault
was
a
steep
narrow
stone
staircase
closed
at
the
top
by
a
heavy
trapdoor
other
outlet
apparently
there
was
none
some
little
air
was
admitted
to
this
foul
abode
through
flues
contrived
in
the
walls
the
entrances
to
which
were
grated
but
the
light
of
day
never
came
there
the
flame
however
issuing
from
the
brow
of
the
demon
image
like
the
lamps
in
the
sepulchres
of
the
disciples
of
the
rosy
cross
was
behind
the
sable
statue
was
a
deep
well
with
water
as
black
as
ink
wherein
swarmed
snakes
and
toads
and
other
noxious
reptiles
and
as
the
lurid
light
fell
upon
its
surface
it
glittered
like
a
dusky
mirror
unless
when
broken
by
the
horrible
things
that
lurked
beneath
or
crawled
about
upon
its
slimy
brim
but
snakes
and
toads
were
not
the
only
tenants
of
the
vault
at
the
head
of
the
steps
squatted
a
monstrous
and
misshapen
animal
bearing
some
resemblance
to
a
cat
but
as
big
as
a
tiger
its
skin
was
black
and
shaggy
its
eyes
glowed
like
those
of
the
hyæna
and
its
cry
was
like
that
of
the
same
treacherous
beast
among
the
gloomy
colonnades
other
swart
and
bestial
shapes
could
be
indistinctly
seen
moving
to
and
fro
in
this
abode
of
horror
were
two
human
beings
one
a
young
maiden
of
exquisite
beauty
and
the
other
almost
a
child
and
strangely
deformed
the
elder
overpowered
by
terror
was
clinging
to
a
pillar
for
support
while
the
younger
who
might
naturally
be
expected
to
exhibit
the
greatest
alarm
appeared
wholly
unconcerned
and
derided
her
fears
oh
jennet
exclaimed
the
elder
of
the
two
is
there
no
means
of
escape
none
whatever
replied
the
other
yo

till

never
exclaimed
alizon
and
while
striving
to
call
upon
heaven
for
aid
a
sharp
convulsion
seized
her
and
deprived
her
of
the
power
of

the

and

jennet
said
alizon
sadly
but
firmly
your
grandmother
may
immure
me
in
this
dungeon
and
scare
away
my
senses
but
she
will
never
rob
me
of
my
hopes
of
salvation
as
the
words
were
uttered
a
clang
like
that
produced
by
a
stricken
gong
shook
the
vault
the
beasts
roared
fiercely
the
black
waters
of
the
fountain
bubbled
up
and
were
lashed
into
foam
by
the
angry
reptiles
and
a
larger
jet
of
flame
than
before
burst
from
the
brow
of
the
demon
statue
ey

said
jennet
alarmed
by

demonstrations

shrieked
alizon
by
our
past
sisterly
affection
i
implore

dreadful
beings

jennet
whoy

ah

cried
alizon
would
i
had
the
power
to
turn
your
heart
to
open
your
eyes
to
evil
to
save
you
jennet
these
words
were
followed
by
another
clang
louder
and
more
brattling
than
the
first
the
solid
walls
of
the
dungeon
were
shaken
and
the
heavy
columns
rocked
while
to
alizon
affrighted
gaze
it
seemed
as
if
the
sable
statue
arose
upon
its
ebon
throne
and
stretched
out
its
arm
menacingly
towards
her
the
poor
girl
was
saved
from
further
terror
by
insensibility
how
long
she
remained
in
this
condition
she
could
not
tell
nor
did
it
appear
that
any
efforts
were
made
to
restore
her
but
when
she
recovered
she
found
herself
stretched
upon
a
rude
pallet
within
an
arched
recess
the
entrance
to
which
was
screened
by
a
piece
of
tapestry
on
lifting
it
aside
she
perceived
she
was
no
longer
in
the
vault
but
in
an
upper
chamber
as
she
judged
and
not
incorrectly
of
the
tower
the
room
was
lofty
and
circular
and
the
walls
of
enormous
thickness
as
shown
by
the
deep
embrasures
of
the
windows
in
one
of
which
the
outlet
having
been
built
up
the
pallet
was
placed
a
massive
oak
table
two
or
three
chairs
of
antique
shape
and
a
wooden
stool
constituted
the
furniture
of
the
room
the
stool
was
set
near
the
fireplace
and
beside
it
stood
a
which
had
apparently
been
recently
used
but
neither
the
old
hag
nor
her
were
visible
alizon
could
not
tell
whether
it
was
night
or
day
but
a
lamp
was
burning
upon
the
table
its
feeble
light
only
imperfectly
illumining
the
chamber
and
scarcely
revealing
several
strange
objects
dangling
from
the
huge
beams
that
supported
the
roof
faded
arras
were
hung
against
the
walls
representing
in
one
compartment
the
last
banquet
of
isole
de
heton
and
her
lover
blackburn
in
another
the
saxon
ughtred
hanging
from
the
summit
of
malkin
tower
and
in
a
third
the
execution
of
abbot
paslew
the
subjects
were
as
large
as
life
admirably
depicted
and
evidently
worked
at
wondrous
looms
as
they
swayed
to
and
fro
in
the
gusts
that
found
entrance
into
the
chamber
through
some
unprotected
loopholes
the
figures
had
a
grim
and
ghostly
air
weak
trembling
bewildered
alizon
stepped
forth
and
staggering
towards
the
table
sank
upon
a
chair
beside
it
a
fearful
storm
was
raging
without
thunder
lightning
deluging
rain
stunned
and
blinded
she
covered
her
eyes
and
remained
thus
till
the
fury
of
the
tempest
had
in
some
degree
abated
she
was
roused
at
length
by
a
creaking
sound
not
far
from
her
and
found
it
proceeded
from
a
trapdoor
rising
slowly
on
its
hinges
a
thrum
cap
first
appeared
above
the
level
of
the
floor
then
a
broad
bloated
face
the
mouth
and
chin
fringed
with
a
white
beard
like
the
whiskers
of
a
cat
then
a
thick
bull
throat
then
a
pair
of
brawny
shoulders
then
a
square
frame
and
mother
demdike
stood
before
her
a
malignant
smile
played
upon
her
hideous
countenance
and
gleamed
from
her
eyes
those
eyes
so
strangely
placed
by
nature
as
if
to
intimate
her
doom
and
that
of
her
fated
race
to
whom
the
horrible
blemish
was
transmitted
as
the
old
witch
leaped
heavily
upon
the
ground
the
trapdoor
closed
behind
her
soh
you
are
better
alizon
and
have
quitted
your
couch
i
find
she
cried
striking
her
staff
upon
the
floor
but
you
look
faint
and
feeble
still
i
will
give
you
something
to
revive
you
i
have
a
wondrous
cordial
in
yon
closet
a
rare
restorative
ha
ha
it
will
make
you
well
the
moment
it
has
passed
your
lips
i
will
fetch
it
at
once
i
will
have
none
of
it
replied
alizon
i
would
rather
die
rather
die
echoed
mother
demdike
sarcastically
because
forsooth
you
are
crossed
in
love
but
you
shall
have
the
man
of
your
heart
yet
if
you
will
only
follow
my
counsel
and
do
as
i
bid
you
richard
assheton
shall
be
yours
and
with
your
mother
consent
provided
i
understand
the
condition
you
annex
to
the
promise
interrupted
alizon
and
the
terms
upon
which
you
would
fulfil
it
but
you
seek
in
vain
to
tempt
me
old
woman
i
now
comprehend
why
i
am
brought
hither
ay
indeed
exclaimed
the
old
witch
and
why
is
it
then
since
you
are
so
you
desire
to
make
an
offering
to
the
evil
being
you
serve
cried
alizon
with
sudden
energy
you
have
entered
into
some
dark
compact
which
compels
you
to
deliver
up
a
victim
in
each
year
to
the
fiend
or
your
own
soul
becomes
forfeit
thus
you
have
hitherto
lengthened
out
your
wretched
life
and
you
hope
to
extend
the
term
yet
farther
through
me
i
have
heard
this
tale
before
but
i
would
not
believe
it
now
i
do
this
is
why
you
have
stolen
me
from
my
mother
have
braved
her
anger
and
brought
me
to
this
impious
tower
the
old
hag
laughed
hoarsely
the
tale
thou
hast
heard
respecting
me
is
true
she
said
i
a
compact
which
requires
me
to
make
a
proselyte
to
the
power
i
serve
within
each
year
and
if
i
fail
in
doing
so
i
must
pay
the
penalty
thou
hast
mentioned
a
like
compact
exists
between
mistress
nutter
and
the
fiend
she
paused
for
a
moment
to
watch
the
effect
of
her
words
on
alizon
and
then
resumed
thy
mother
would
have
sacrificed
thee
if
thou
hadst
been
left
with
her
but
i
have
carried
thee
off
because
i
conceive
i
am
best
entitled
to
thee
thou
wert
brought
up
as
my
and
therefore
i
claim
thee
as
my
own
and
you
think
to
deal
with
me
as
if
i
were
a
puppet
in
your
hands
cried
alizon
ay
marry
do
i
rejoined
mother
demdike
with
a
scream
of
laughter
thou
art
nothing
more
than
a
puppet
a
puppet
ho
ho
and
you
deem
you
can
dispose
of
my
soul
without
my
consent
said
alizon
thy
full
consent
will
be
obtained
rejoined
the
old
hag
think
it
not
think
it
not
exclaimed
alizon
oh
i
shall
yet
be
delivered
from
this
infernal
bondage
at
this
moment
the
notes
of
a
bugle
were
heard
saved
saved
cried
the
poor
girl
starting
it
is
richard
come
to
my
rescue
how
thou
that
cried
mother
demdike
with
a
spiteful
look
by
an
instinct
that
never
deceives
replied
alizon
as
the
blast
was
again
heard
this
must
be
stopped
said
the
hag
waving
her
staff
over
the
maiden
and
transfixing
her
where
she
sat
after
which
she
took
up
the
lamp
and
strode
towards
the
window
the
few
words
that
passed
between
her
and
richard
have
been
already
recounted
having
closed
the
casement
and
drawn
the
curtain
before
it
mother
demdike
traced
a
circle
on
the
floor
muttered
a
spell
and
then
waving
her
staff
over
alizon
restored
her
power
of
speech
and
motion
was
he
exclaimed
the
young
girl
as
soon
as
she
could
find
utterance
i
heard
his
voice
why
ay
was
he
sure
enough
rejoined
the
beldame
he
has
come
on
a
fool
errand
but
he
shall
never
return
from
it
does
mistress
nutter
think
i
will
give
up
my
prize
the
moment
i
have
obtained
it
for
the
mere
asking
does
she
imagine
she
can
frighten
me
as
she
frightens
others
does
she
know
whom
she
has
to
deal
with
if
not
i
will
tell
her
i
am
the
oldest
the
boldest
and
the
strongest
of
the
witches
no
mystery
of
the
black
art
but
is
known
to
me
i
can
do
what
mischief
i
will
and
my
desolating
hand
has
been
felt
throughout
this
district
you
may
trace
it
like
a
pestilence
no
one
has
offended
me
but
i
have
terribly
repaid
him
i
rule
over
the
land
like
a
queen
i
exact
tributes
and
if
they
are
not
rendered
i
smite
with
a
sharper
edge
than
the
sword
my
worship
is
paid
to
the
prince
of
darkness
this
tower
is
his
temple
and
yon
subterranean
chamber
the
place
where
the
mystical
rites
which
thou
wouldst
call
impious
and
damnable
are
performed
countless
sabbaths
have
i
attended
within
it
or
upon
rumbles
moor
or
on
the
summit
of
pendle
hill
or
within
the
ruins
of
whalley
abbey
many
proselytes
have
i
made
many
unbaptised
babes
offered
up
in
sacrifice
i
am
to
the
demon
and
thy
mother
would
usurp
mine
office
oh
spare
me
this
horrible
recital
exclaimed
alizon
vainly
trying
to
shut
out
the
hag
piercing
voice
i
will
spare
thee
nothing
pursued
mother
demdike
thy
mother
i
say
would
be
in
my
stead
there
are
degrees
among
witches
as
among
other
sects
and
mine
is
the
first
mistress
nutter
would
deprive
me
of
mine
office
but
not
till
her
hair
is
as
white
as
mine
her
knowledge
equal
to
mine
and
her
hatred
of
mankind
as
intense
as
mine
not
till
then
shall
she
have
it
no
more
of
this
in
pity
cried
alizon
often
have
i
aided
thy
mother
in
her
dark
schemes
pursued
the
implacable
hag
nay
no
later
than
last
night
i
obliterated
the
old
boundaries
of
her
land
and
erected
new
marks
to
serve
her
it
was
a
strong
exercise
of
power
but
the
command
came
to
me
and
i
obeyed
it
no
other
witch
could
have
achieved
so
much
not
even
the
accursed
chattox
and
she
is
next
to
myself
and
how
does
thy
mother
purpose
to
requite
me
by
thrusting
me
aside
and
stepping
into
my
throne
you
must
be
in
error
cried
alizon
scarcely
knowing
what
to
say
my
information
never
fails
me
replied
the
hag
with
a
disdainful
laugh
her
plans
are
made
known
to
me
as
soon
as
formed
i
have
those
about
her
who
keep
strict
watch
upon
her
actions
and
report
them
faithfully
i
know
why
she
brought
thee
so
suddenly
to
rough
lee
though
thou
it
not
she
brought
me
there
for
safety
remarked
the
young
girl
hoping
to
allay
the
beldame
fury
and
because
she
herself
desired
to
know
how
the
survey
of
the
boundaries
would
end
she
brought
thee
there
to
sacrifice
thee
to
the
fiend
cried
the
hag
infernal
rage
and
malice
blazing
in
her
eyes
she
failed
in
propitiating
him
at
the
meeting
in
the
ruined
church
of
whalley
last
night
when
thou
thyself
wert
present
and
deliveredst
dorothy
assheton
from
the
snare
in
which
she
was
taken
and
since
then
all
has
gone
wrong
with
her
having
demanded
from
her
familiar
the
cause
why
all
things
ran
counter
she
was
told
she
had
failed
in
the
fulfilment
of
her
promise
that
a
proselyte
was
required
and
that
thou
alone
wouldst
be
accepted
i
exclaimed
alizon
ay
thou
cried
the
hag
no
choice
was
allowed
her
and
the
offering
must
be
made
after
a
long
and
painful
struggle
thy
mother
consented
oh
no
impossible
you
deceive
me
cried
the
wretched
girl
i
tell
thee
she
consented
rejoined
mother
demdike
coldly
and
on
this
she
made
instant
arrangements
to
return
home
and
in
spite
as
thou
of
sir
ralph
and
lady
assheton
efforts
to
detain
her
set
forth
with
thee
all
this
i
know
observed
alizon
sadly
and
intelligence
of
our
departure
from
the
abbey
was
conveyed
to
you
i
conclude
by
jennet
to
whom
i
bade
adieu
thou
art
right
it
was
returned
the
hag
but
i
have
yet
more
to
tell
thee
for
i
will
lay
the
secrets
of
thy
mother
dark
breast
fully
before
thee
her
time
is
wellnigh
run
thou
wert
made
the
price
of
its
extension
if
she
fails
in
offering
thee
up
and
thou
art
here
in
my
keeping
the
fiend
her
master
will
abandon
her
and
she
will
be
delivered
up
to
the
justice
of
man
alizon
covered
her
face
with
horror
after
awhile
she
looked
up
and
exclaimed
with
unutterable
anguish
and
i
can
not
help
her
the
unpitying
hag
laughed
derisively
she
can
not
be
utterly
lost
continued
the
young
girl
were
i
near
her
i
would
show
her
that
heaven
is
merciful
to
the
greatest
sinner
who
repents
and
teach
her
how
to
regain
the
lost
path
to
salvation
peace
thundered
the
witch
shaking
her
huge
hand
at
her
and
stamping
her
heavy
foot
upon
the
ground
such
words
must
not
be
uttered
here
they
are
an
offence
to
me
thy
mother
has
renounced
all
hopes
of
heaven
she
has
been
baptised
in
the
baptism
of
hell
and
branded
on
the
brow
by
the
red
finger
of
its
ruler
and
can
not
be
wrested
from
him
it
is
too
late
no
no
it
never
can
be
too
late
cried
alizon
it
is
not
even
too
late
for
you
thou
not
what
thou
about
foolish
wench
rejoined
the
hag
our
master
would
tear
us
instantly
in
pieces
if
but
a
thought
of
penitence
as
thou
callest
it
crossed
our
minds
we
are
both
doomed
to
an
eternity
of
torture
but
thy
mother
will
go
first
ay
first
if
she
had
yielded
thee
up
another
term
would
have
been
allowed
her
but
as
i
hold
thee
instead
the
benefit
of
the
sacrifice
will
be
mine
but
hist
what
was
that
the
youth
again
alice
nutter
must
have
given
him
some
potent
he
comes
to
deliver
me
cried
alizon
richard
and
she
arose
and
would
have
flown
to
the
window
but
mother
demdike
waved
her
staff
over
her
and
rooted
her
to
the
ground
stay
there
till
i
require
thee
chuckled
the
hag
moving
with
ponderous
footsteps
to
the
door
after
parleying
with
richard
as
already
related
mother
demdike
suddenly
returned
to
alizon
and
restoring
her
to
sensibility
placed
her
hideous
face
close
to
her
breathing
upon
her
and
uttering
these
words
be
thine
eyes
blinded
and
thy
brain
confused
so
that
thou
mayst
not
know
him
when
thou
seest
him
but
think
him
another
the
spell
took
instant
effect
alizon
staggered
towards
the
table
richard
was
summoned
and
on
his
appearance
the
scene
took
place
which
has
already
been
detailed
and
which
ended
in
his
losing
the
talisman
and
being
ejected
from
the
tower
alizon
had
been
rendered
invisible
by
the
old
witch
and
was
afterwards
dragged
into
the
arched
recess
by
her
where
snatching
the
piece
of
gold
from
the
young
girl
neck
she
exclaimed
triumphantly
now
i
defy
thee
alice
nutter
thou
canst
never
recover
thy
child
the
offering
shall
be
made
and
another
year
be
added
to
my
long
term
alizon
groaned
deeply
but
at
a
gesture
from
the
hag
she
became
motionless
and
speechless
a
dusky
figure
hovered
near
the
entrance
of
the
embrasure
mother
demdike
beckoned
it
to
her
convey
this
girl
to
the
vault
and
watch
over
her
she
said
i
will
descend
anon
upon
this
the
shadowy
arms
enveloped
alizon
the
trapdoor
flew
open
and
the
figure
disappeared
with
its
inanimate
burthen
chapter
the
two
familiars
after
seeing
richard
depart
on
his
perilous
mission
to
malkin
tower
mistress
nutter
retired
to
her
own
chamber
and
held
long
and
anxious
the
course
of
her
thoughts
may
be
gathered
from
the
terrible
revelations
made
by
mother
demdike
to
alizon
a
prey
to
the
most
agonising
emotions
it
may
be
questioned
if
she
could
have
endured
greater
torment
if
her
heart
had
been
consumed
by
living
fire
as
in
the
punishment
assigned
to
the
damned
in
the
fabled
halls
of
eblis
for
the
first
time
remorse
assailed
her
and
she
felt
compunction
for
the
evil
she
had
committed
the
whole
of
her
dark
career
passed
in
review
before
her
the
long
catalogue
of
her
crimes
unfolded
itself
like
a
scroll
of
flame
and
at
its
foot
were
written
in
blazing
characters
the
awful
words
judgment
and
condemnation
there
was
no
escape
none
hell
with
its
unquenchable
fires
and
unimaginable
horrors
yawned
to
receive
her
and
she
felt
with
anguish
and
not
to
be
described
how
wretched
a
bargain
she
had
made
and
how
dearly
the
brief
gratification
of
her
evil
passions
had
been
purchased
at
the
cost
of
an
eternity
of
woe
and
torture
this
change
of
feeling
had
been
produced
by
her
affection
for
her
daughter
long
supposed
dead
and
now
restored
to
her
only
to
be
snatched
away
again
in
a
manner
which
added
to
the
sharpness
of
the
loss
she
saw
herself
the
sport
of
a
juggling
fiend
whose
aim
was
to
win
over
her
daughter
soul
through
her
instrumentality
and
she
resolved
if
possible
to
defeat
his
purposes
this
she
was
aware
could
only
be
accomplished
by
her
own
destruction
but
even
this
dread
alternative
she
was
prepared
to
embrace
alizon
sinless
nature
and
devotion
to
herself
had
so
wrought
upon
her
that
though
she
had
at
first
resisted
the
better
impulses
kindled
within
her
bosom
in
the
end
they
completely
overmastered
her
was
it
she
asked
herself
too
late
to
repent
was
there
no
way
of
breaking
her
compact
she
remembered
to
have
read
of
a
young
man
who
had
signed
away
his
own
soul
being
restored
to
heaven
by
the
intercession
of
the
great
reformer
of
the
church
martin
luther
but
on
the
other
hand
she
had
heard
of
many
others
who
on
the
slightest
manifestation
of
penitence
had
been
rent
in
pieces
by
the
fiend
still
the
idea
recurred
to
her
might
not
her
daughter
armed
with
perfect
purity
and
holiness
with
a
soul
free
from
stain
as
an
unspotted
mirror
might
not
she
who
had
avouched
herself
ready
to
risk
all
for
her
for
she
had
overheard
her
declaration
to
richard
might
not
she
be
able
to
work
out
her
salvation
would
confession
of
her
sins
and
voluntary
submission
to
earthly
justice
save
her
alas
no
she
was
without
hope
she
had
an
inexorable
master
to
deal
with
who
would
grant
her
no
grace
except
upon
conditions
she
would
not
assent
to
she
would
have
thrown
herself
on
her
knees
but
they
refused
to
bend
she
would
have
prayed
but
the
words
turned
to
blasphemies
she
would
have
wept
but
the
fountains
of
tears
were
dry
the
witch
could
never
weep
then
came
despair
and
frenzy
and
like
furies
lashed
her
with
whips
of
scorpions
goading
her
with
the
memory
of
her
abominations
and
idolatries
and
her
infinite
and
varied
iniquities
they
showed
her
as
in
a
vision
all
who
had
suffered
wrong
by
her
or
whom
her
malice
had
afflicted
in
body
or
estate
they
mocked
her
with
a
glimpse
of
the
paradise
she
had
forfeited
she
saw
her
daughter
in
a
beatified
state
about
to
enter
its
golden
portals
and
would
have
clung
to
her
robes
in
the
hope
of
being
carried
in
with
her
but
she
was
driven
away
by
an
angel
with
a
flaming
sword
who
cried
out
thou
hast
abjured
heaven
and
heaven
rejects
thee
satan
brand
is
upon
thy
brow
and
unless
it
be
effaced
thou
canst
never
enter
here
down
to
tophet
thou
witch
then
she
implored
her
daughter
to
touch
her
brow
with
the
tip
of
her
finger
and
as
the
latter
was
about
to
comply
a
dark
demoniacal
shape
suddenly
rose
and
seizing
her
by
the
hair
plunged
with
her
down
down
millions
of
miles
till
she
beheld
a
world
of
fire
appear
beneath
her
consisting
of
a
multitude
of
volcanoes
roaring
and
raging
like
furnaces
boiling
over
with
redhot
lava
and
casting
forth
huge
burning
stones
in
each
of
these
beds
of
fire
thousands
upon
thousands
of
sufferers
were
writhing
and
their
groans
and
lamentations
arose
in
one
frightful
incessant
wail
too
terrible
for
human
hearing
over
this
place
of
torment
the
demon
held
her
suspended
she
shrieked
aloud
in
her
agony
and
shaking
off
the
oppression
rejoiced
to
find
the
vision
had
been
caused
by
her
own
distempered
imagination
meanwhile
the
storm
which
had
obstructed
richard
as
he
climbed
the
hill
had
come
on
though
mistress
nutter
had
not
noticed
it
but
now
a
loud
peal
of
thunder
shook
the
room
and
rousing
herself
she
walked
to
the
window
the
sight
she
beheld
increased
her
alarm
heavy
rested
upon
the
and
seemed
ready
to
discharge
their
artillery
upon
the
course
which
she
knew
must
be
taken
by
the
young
man
the
chamber
in
which
she
stood
it
has
been
said
was
large
and
gloomy
with
a
wainscoting
of
dark
oak
on
one
of
the
panels
was
painted
a
picture
of
herself
in
her
days
of
youth
innocence
and
beauty
and
on
another
a
portrait
of
her
unfortunate
husband
who
appeared
a
handsome
young
man
with
a
stern
countenance
attired
in
a
black
velvet
doublet
and
cloak
of
the
fashion
of
elizabeth
day
between
these
paintings
stood
a
carved
oak
bedstead
with
a
high
tester
and
dark
heavy
drapery
opposite
which
was
a
wide
window
occupying
almost
the
whole
length
of
the
room
but
darkened
by
thick
bars
and
glass
crowded
with
armorial
bearings
or
otherwise
deeply
dyed
the
high
mantelpiece
and
its
carvings
have
been
previously
described
as
well
as
the
bloody
hearthstone
where
the
tragical
incident
occurred
connected
with
alizon
early
history
as
mistress
nutter
returned
to
the
fireplace
a
plaintive
cry
arose
from
it
and
starting
for
the
sound
revived
terrible
memories
within
her
breast
she
beheld
the
ineffaceable
stains
upon
the
flag
traced
out
by
blue
phosphoric
fire
while
above
them
hovered
the
shape
of
a
bleeding
infant
she
averted
her
gaze
but
it
encountered
another
object
equally
appalling
her
husband
portrait
or
rather
it
would
seem
a
phantom
in
its
place
for
the
eyes
lighted
up
by
infernal
fire
glared
at
her
from
beneath
the
frowning
and
contracted
brows
while
the
hand
significantly
pointed
to
the
hearthstone
on
which
the
sanguinary
stains
had
now
formed
themselves
into
the
fatal
word
vengeance
in
a
few
minutes
the
fiery
characters
died
away
and
the
portrait
resumed
its
wonted
expression
but
ere
mistress
nutter
had
recovered
from
her
terror
the
back
of
the
fireplace
opened
and
a
tall
swarthy
man
stepped
out
from
it
as
he
appeared
a
flash
of
lightning
illumined
the
chamber
and
revealed
his
fiendish
countenance
on
seeing
him
the
lady
immediately
regained
her
courage
and
addressed
him
in
a
haughty
and
commanding
tone
why
this
intrusion
i
did
not
summon
thee
and
do
not
require
thee
you
are
mistaken
madam
he
replied
you
had
never
more
occasion
for
me
than
at
this
moment
and
so
far
from
intruding
upon
you
i
have
avoided
coming
near
you
even
though
enjoined
to
do
so
by
my
lord
he
is
perfectly
aware
of
the
change
which
has
just
taken
place
in
your
opinions
and
the
anxiety
you
now
feel
to
break
the
contract
you
have
entered
into
with
him
and
which
he
has
scrupulously
fulfilled
on
his
part
but
he
wishes
you
distinctly
to
understand
that
he
has
no
intention
of
abandoning
his
claims
upon
you
but
will
most
assuredly
enforce
them
at
the
proper
time
i
need
not
remind
you
that
your
term
draws
to
a
close
and
ere
many
months
must
expire
but
means
of
extending
it
have
been
offered
you
if
you
choose
to
avail
yourself
of
them
i
have
no
such
intention
replied
mistress
nutter
in
a
decided
tone
so
be
it
madam
replied
the
other
but
you
will
not
preserve
your
daughter
who
is
in
the
hands
of
a
tried
and
faithful
servant
of
my
lord
and
what
you
hesitate
to
do
that
servant
will
perform
and
so
reap
the
benefit
of
the
sacrifice
not
so
rejoined
mistress
nutter
i
say
yea
retorted
the
familiar
thou
art
my
slave
i
command
thee
to
bring
alizon
hither
at
once
the
familiar
shook
his
head
thou
refusest
cried
mistress
nutter
menacingly
thou
not
i
have
the
means
of
chastising
thee
you
had
madam
replied
the
other
but
the
moment
a
thought
of
penitence
crossed
your
breast
the
power
you
were
invested
with
departed
my
lord
however
is
willing
to
give
you
an
hour
of
grace
when
if
you
voluntarily
renew
your
oaths
to
him
he
will
accept
them
and
place
me
at
your
disposal
once
more
but
if
you
still
continue
obstinate
he
will
abandon
me
interrupted
mistress
nutter
i
knew
it
fool
that
i
was
to
trust
one
who
from
the
beginning
has
been
a
deceiver
you
have
a
short
memory
and
but
little
gratitude
madam
and
seem
entirely
to
forget
the
important
favour
conferred
upon
you
last
night
at
your
solicitation
the
boundaries
of
your
property
were
changed
and
large
slips
of
land
filched
from
another
to
be
given
to
you
but
if
you
fail
in
your
duty
you
can
not
expect
this
to
continue
the
boundary
marks
will
be
set
up
in
their
old
places
and
the
land
restored
to
its
rightful
owner
i
expected
as
much
observed
mistress
nutter
disdainfully
thus
all
our
pains
will
be
thrown
away
pursued
the
familiar
and
though
you
may
make
light
of
the
labour
it
is
no
easy
task
to
change
the
face
of
a
whole
country
to
turn
streams
from
their
course
move
bogs
transplant
trees
and
shift
houses
all
of
which
has
been
done
and
will
now
have
to
be
undone
because
of
your
inconstancy
i
myself
have
been
obliged
to
act
as
many
parts
as
a
poor
player
to
please
you
and
now
you
dismiss
me
at
a
moment
notice
as
if
i
had
played
them
indifferently
whereas
the
most
fastidious
audience
would
have
been
ravished
with
my
performance
this
morning
i
was
the
reeve
of
the
forest
and
as
such
obliged
to
assume
the
shape
of
a
rascally
attorney
i
felt
it
a
degradation
i
assure
you
nor
was
i
better
pleased
when
you
compelled
me
to
put
on
the
likeness
of
old
roger
nowell
for
whatever
you
may
think
i
am
not
so
entirely
destitute
of
personal
vanity
as
to
prefer
either
of
their
figures
to
my
own
however
i
showed
no
disinclination
to
oblige
you
you
are
strangely
unreasonable
is
it
my
lord
fault
if
your
desire
of
vengeance
expires
in
its
fruition
if
when
you
have
accomplished
an
object
you
no
longer
care
for
it
you
ask
for
revenge
for
power
you
have
them
and
cast
them
aside
like
childish
baubles
thy
lord
is
an
arch
deceiver
rejoined
mistress
nutter
and
can
not
perform
his
promises
they
are
empty
delusions
profitless
unsubstantial
as
shadows
his
power
prevails
not
against
any
thing
holy
as
i
myself
have
just
now
experienced
his
money
turns
to
withered
leaves
his
treasures
are
dust
and
ashes
strong
only
is
he
in
power
of
mischief
and
even
his
mischief
like
curses
recoils
on
those
who
use
it
his
vengeance
is
no
true
vengeance
for
it
troubles
the
conscience
and
engenders
remorse
whereas
the
servant
of
heaven
heaps
coals
of
fire
on
the
head
of
his
adversary
by
kindness
and
satisfies
his
own
heart
you
should
have
thought
of
all
this
before
you
vowed
yourself
to
him
said
the
familiar
it
is
too
late
to
reflect
now
perchance
not
rejoined
mistress
nutter
beware
thundered
the
demon
with
a
terrible
gesture
any
overt
act
of
disobedience
and
your
limbs
shall
be
scattered
over
this
chamber
if
i
do
not
dare
thee
to
it
it
is
not
because
i
fear
thee
replied
mistress
nutter
in
no
way
dismayed
by
the
threat
thou
canst
not
control
my
tongue
thou
speakest
of
the
services
rendered
by
thy
lord
and
i
repeat
they
are
like
his
promises
naught
show
me
the
witch
he
has
enriched
of
what
profit
is
her
worship
of
the
false
deity
of
what
avail
the
sacrifices
she
makes
at
his
foul
altars
it
is
ever
the
same
spilling
of
blood
ever
the
same
working
of
mischief
the
wheels
of
crime
roll
on
like
the
car
of
the
indian
idol
crushing
all
before
them
doth
thy
master
ever
help
his
servants
in
their
need
doth
he
not
ever
abandon
them
when
they
are
no
longer
useful
and
can
win
him
no
more
proselytes
miserable
servants
miserable
master
look
at
the
murtherous
demdike
and
the
malignant
chattox
and
examine
the
means
whereby
they
have
prolonged
their
baleful
career
enormities
of
all
kinds
committed
and
all
their
families
devoted
to
the
fiend
all
wizards
or
witches
look
at
them
i
say
what
profit
to
them
is
their
long
service
are
they
rich
are
they
in
possession
of
unfading
youth
and
beauty
are
they
splendidly
lodged
have
they
all
they
desire
no
the
one
dwells
in
a
solitary
turret
and
the
other
in
a
wretched
hovel
and
both
are
miserable
creatures
living
only
on
the
dole
wrung
by
threats
from
terrified
peasants
and
capable
of
no
gratification
but
such
as
results
from
practices
of
malice
is
that
nothing
asked
the
familiar
to
them
it
is
every
thing
they
care
neither
for
splendid
mansions
nor
wealth
nor
youth
nor
beauty
if
they
did
they
could
have
them
all
they
care
only
for
the
dread
and
mysterious
power
they
possess
to
be
able
to
fascinate
with
a
glance
to
transfix
by
a
gesture
to
inflict
strange
ailments
by
a
word
and
to
kill
by
a
curse
this
is
the
privilege
they
seek
and
this
privilege
they
enjoy
and
what
is
the
end
of
it
all
demanded
mistress
nutter
sternly
erelong
they
will
be
unable
to
furnish
victims
to
their
insatiate
master
who
will
then
abandon
them
their
bodies
will
go
to
the
hangman
and
their
souls
to
endless
bale
the
familiar
laughed
as
if
a
good
joke
had
been
repeated
to
him
and
rubbed
his
hands
gleefully
very
true
he
said
very
true
you
have
stated
the
case
exactly
madam
such
will
certainly
be
the
course
of
events
but
what
of
that
the
old
hags
will
have
enjoyed
a
long
term
much
longer
than
might
have
been
anticipated
mother
demdike
however
as
i
have
intimated
will
extend
hers
and
it
is
fortunate
for
her
she
is
enabled
to
do
so
as
it
would
otherwise
expire
an
hour
after
midnight
and
could
not
be
renewed
thou
liest
cried
mistress
nutter
liest
like
thy
lord
who
is
the
father
of
lies
my
innocent
child
can
never
be
offered
up
at
his
impious
shrine
i
have
no
fear
for
her
neither
he
nor
mother
demdike
nor
any
of
the
accursed
sisterhood
can
harm
her
her
goodness
will
cover
her
like
armour
which
no
evil
can
penetrate
let
him
wreak
his
vengeance
if
he
will
on
me
let
him
treat
me
as
a
slave
who
has
cast
off
his
yoke
let
him
abridge
the
scanty
time
allotted
me
and
bear
me
hence
to
his
burning
kingdom
but
injure
my
child
he
can
not
shall
not
go
to
malkin
tower
at
midnight
and
thou
wilt
see
replied
the
familiar
with
a
mocking
laugh
i
will
go
there
but
it
shall
be
to
deliver
her
rejoined
mistress
nutter
and
now
get
thee
gone
i
need
thee
no
more
be
not
deceived
proud
woman
said
the
familiar
once
dismissed
i
may
not
be
recalled
while
thou
wilt
be
wholly
unable
to
defend
thyself
against
thy
enemies
i
care
not
she
rejoined
begone
the
familiar
stepped
back
and
stamping
upon
the
hearthstone
it
sank
like
a
trapdoor
and
he
disappeared
beneath
it
a
flash
of
lightning
playing
round
his
dusky
figure
notwithstanding
her
vaunted
resolution
and
the
boldness
with
which
she
had
comported
herself
before
the
familiar
mistress
nutter
now
completely
gave
way
and
for
awhile
abandoned
herself
to
despair
aroused
at
length
by
the
absolute
necessity
of
action
she
again
walked
to
the
window
and
looked
forth
the
storm
still
raged
furiously
without
so
furiously
indeed
that
it
would
be
madness
to
brave
it
now
that
she
was
deprived
of
her
power
and
reduced
to
the
ordinary
level
of
humanity
its
very
violence
however
assured
her
it
must
soon
cease
and
she
would
then
set
out
for
malkin
tower
but
what
chance
had
she
now
in
a
struggle
with
the
old
hag
with
all
the
energies
of
hell
at
her
command
what
hope
was
there
of
her
being
able
to
effect
her
liberation
no
matter
however
desperate
the
attempt
should
be
made
meanwhile
it
would
be
necessary
so
see
what
was
going
on
below
and
ascertain
whether
blackadder
had
returned
with
parson
holden
with
this
view
she
descended
to
the
hall
where
she
found
nicholas
assheton
fast
asleep
in
a
great
and
rocked
rather
than
disturbed
by
the
loud
concussions
of
thunder
the
squire
was
no
doubt
overcome
by
the
fatigues
of
the
day
or
it
might
be
by
the
potency
of
the
wine
he
had
swallowed
for
an
empty
flask
stood
on
the
table
beside
him
mistress
nutter
did
not
awaken
him
but
proceeded
to
the
chamber
where
she
had
left
nowell
and
potts
prisoners
both
of
whom
rose
on
her
entrance
be
seated
gentlemen
i
pray
you
she
said
courteously
i
am
come
to
see
if
you
need
any
thing
for
when
this
fearful
storm
abates
i
am
going
forth
for
a
short
time
indeed
madam
replied
potts
for
myself
i
require
nothing
further
but
perhaps
another
bottle
of
wine
might
be
agreeable
to
my
honoured
and
singular
good
client
speak
for
yourself
sir
cried
roger
nowell
sharply
you
shall
have
it
interposed
mistress
nutter
i
shall
be
glad
of
a
word
with
you
before
i
go
master
nowell
i
am
sorry
this
dispute
has
arisen
between
us
humph
exclaimed
the
magistrate
very
sorry
pursued
mistress
nutter
and
i
wish
to
make
every
reparation
in
my
power
reparation
madam
cried
nowell
give
back
the
land
you
have
stolen
from
me
restore
the
boundary
lines
sign
the
deed
in
sir
possession
that
is
the
only
reparation
you
can
make
i
will
replied
mistress
nutter
you
will
exclaimed
nowell
then
the
fellow
did
not
deceive
us
master
potts
has
any
one
been
with
you
asked
the
lady
uneasily
ay
the
reeve
of
the
forest
replied
nowell
he
told
us
you
would
be
with
us
presently
and
would
make
fair
offers
to
us
and
he
told
us
also
you
would
make
them
madam
added
potts
in
an
insolent
and
menacing
tone
he
told
us
you
would
make
a
merit
of
doing
what
you
could
not
help
that
your
power
had
gone
from
you
that
your
works
of
darkness
would
be
destroyed
and
that
in
a
word
you
were
abandoned
by
the
devil
your
master
he
deceived
you
replied
mistress
nutter
i
have
made
you
the
offer
out
of
pure
and
you
can
reject
it
or
not
as
you
please
all
i
stipulate
if
you
do
accept
it
is
that
you
pledge
me
your
word
not
to
bring
any
charge
of
witchcraft
against
me
do
not
give
the
pledge
whispered
a
voice
in
the
ear
of
the
magistrate
did
you
speak
he
said
turning
to
potts
no
sir
replied
the
attorney
in
a
low
tone
but
i
thought
you
cautioned
me
against
hush
interrupted
nowell
it
must
be
the
reeve
we
can
not
comply
with
your
request
madam
he
added
aloud
certainly
not
said
potts
we
can
make
no
bargain
with
an
avowed
witch
we
should
gain
nothing
by
it
on
the
contrary
we
should
be
losers
for
we
have
the
positive
assurance
of
a
gentleman
whom
we
believe
to
be
upon
terms
of
intimacy
with
a
certain
black
gentleman
of
your
acquaintance
madam
that
the
latter
has
given
you
up
entirely
and
that
law
and
justice
may
therefore
take
their
course
we
protest
against
our
unlawful
detention
but
we
give
ourselves
small
concern
about
it
as
sir
ralph
assheton
who
will
be
advised
of
our
situation
by
parson
holden
will
speedily
come
to
our
liberation
yes
we
are
now
quite
easy
on
that
score
madam
added
nowell
and
we
shall
have
the
pleasure
of
escorting
you
to
lancaster
castle
and
your
trial
will
come
on
at
the
next
assizes
about
the
middle
of
august
said
potts
you
have
only
four
months
to
run
that
is
indeed
my
term
muttered
the
lady
i
shall
not
tarry
to
listen
to
your
taunts
she
added
aloud
you
may
possibly
regret
rejecting
my
proposal
so
saying
she
quitted
the
room
as
she
returned
to
the
hall
nicholas
awoke
what
a
devil
of
a
storm
he
exclaimed
stretching
himself
and
rubbing
his
eyes
zounds
that
flash
of
lightning
was
enough
to
blind
me
and
the
thunder
wellnigh
splits
one
ears
yet
you
have
slept
through
louder
peals
nicholas
said
mistress
nutter
coming
up
to
him
richard
has
not
returned
from
his
mission
and
i
must
go
myself
to
malkin
tower
in
my
absence
i
must
entrust
you
with
the
defence
of
my
house
i
am
willing
to
undertake
it
replied
nicholas
provided
no
witchcraft
be
used
nay
you
need
not
fear
that
said
the
lady
with
a
forced
smile
well
then
leave
it
to
me
said
the
squire
but
you
will
not
set
out
till
the
storm
is
over
i
must
replied
mistress
nutter
there
seems
no
likelihood
of
its
cessation
and
each
moment
is
fraught
with
peril
to
alizon
if
aught
happens
to
me
nicholas
if
i
should
whatever
mischance
may
befall
me
promise
me
you
will
stand
by
her
the
squire
gave
the
required
promise
enough
i
hold
you
to
your
word
said
mistress
nutter
take
this
parchment
it
is
a
deed
of
gift
assigning
this
mansion
and
all
my
estates
to
her
under
certain
circumstances
you
will
produce
it
what
circumstances
i
am
at
a
loss
to
understand
you
madam
said
the
squire
do
not
question
me
further
but
take
especial
care
of
the
deed
and
produce
it
as
i
have
said
at
the
fitting
moment
you
will
know
when
that
arrives
ha
i
am
wanted
the
latter
exclamation
had
been
occasioned
by
the
appearance
of
an
old
woman
at
the
further
end
of
the
hall
beckoning
to
her
on
seeing
her
mistress
nutter
immediately
quitted
the
squire
and
followed
her
into
a
small
chamber
opening
from
this
part
of
the
hall
and
into
which
she
retreated
what
brings
you
here
mother
chattox
exclaimed
the
lady
closing
the
door
can
you
not
guess
replied
the
hag
i
am
come
to
help
you
not
for
any
love
i
bear
you
but
to
avenge
myself
on
old
demdike
do
not
interrupt
me
my
familiar
fancy
has
told
me
all
i
know
how
you
are
circumstanced
i
know
alizon
is
in
old
demdike
clutches
and
you
are
unable
to
extricate
her
but
i
can
and
will
because
if
the
hateful
old
hag
fails
in
offering
up
her
sacrifice
before
the
first
hour
of
day
her
term
will
be
out
and
i
shall
be
rid
of
her
and
reign
in
her
stead
she
will
be
on
her
way
to
lancaster
castle
ha
ha
the
dungeon
is
prepared
for
her
the
stake
driven
into
the
ground
the
fagots
heaped
around
it
the
torch
has
only
to
be
lighted
ho
ho
illustration
the
ride
through
the
murky
air
shall
we
go
to
malkin
tower
asked
mistress
nutter
shuddering
no
to
the
summit
of
pendle
hill
rejoined
mother
chattox
for
there
the
girl
will
be
taken
and
there
only
can
we
secure
her
but
first
we
must
proceed
to
my
hut
and
make
some
preparations
i
have
three
scalps
and
eight
teeth
taken
from
a
grave
in
goldshaw
churchyard
this
very
day
we
can
make
a
charm
with
them
you
must
prepare
it
alone
said
mistress
nutter
i
can
have
nought
to
do
with
it
true
true
i
had
forgotten
cried
the
hag
with
a
chuckling
laugh
you
are
no
longer
one
of
us
well
then
i
will
do
it
alone
but
come
with
me
you
will
not
object
to
mount
upon
my
broomstick
it
is
the
only
safe
conveyance
in
this
storm
of
the
devil
raising
come
away
and
she
threw
open
the
window
and
sprang
forth
followed
by
mistress
nutter
through
the
murky
air
and
borne
as
if
on
the
wings
of
the
wind
two
dark
forms
are
flying
swiftly
over
the
tops
of
the
trees
they
go
and
as
they
gain
the
skirts
of
the
thicket
an
oak
beneath
is
shivered
by
a
thunderbolt
they
hear
the
fearful
crash
and
see
the
splinters
fly
far
and
wide
and
the
foremost
of
the
two
who
with
her
skinny
arm
extended
seems
to
direct
their
course
utters
a
wild
scream
of
laughter
while
a
raven
speeding
on
broad
black
wing
before
them
croaks
hoarsely
now
the
torrent
rages
below
and
they
see
its
white
waters
tumbling
over
a
ledge
of
rock
now
they
pass
over
the
brow
of
a
hill
now
skim
over
a
dreary
waste
and
dangerous
morass
fearful
it
is
to
behold
those
two
flying
figures
as
the
lightning
shows
them
bestriding
their
fantastical
steed
the
one
an
old
hag
with
hideous
lineaments
and
distorted
person
and
the
other
a
proud
dame
still
beautiful
though
no
longer
young
pale
as
death
and
her
loose
jetty
hair
streaming
like
a
meteor
in
the
breeze
the
ride
is
over
and
they
alight
near
the
door
of
a
solitary
hovel
the
raven
has
preceded
them
and
perched
on
the
chimney
top
flies
down
it
as
they
enter
and
greets
them
with
hoarse
croaking
the
inside
of
the
hut
corresponds
with
its
miserable
exterior
consisting
only
of
two
rooms
in
one
of
which
is
a
wretched
pallet
in
the
other
are
a
couple
of
large
chests
a
crazy
table
a
bench
a
stool
and
a
a
caldron
is
suspended
above
a
peat
fire
smouldering
on
the
hearth
there
is
only
one
window
and
a
thick
curtain
is
drawn
across
it
to
secure
the
inmate
of
the
hut
from
prying
eyes
mother
chattox
closes
and
bars
the
door
and
motioning
mistress
nutter
to
seat
herself
upon
the
stool
kneels
down
near
the
hearth
and
blows
the
turf
into
a
flame
the
raven
helping
her
by
flapping
his
big
black
wings
and
uttering
a
variety
of
strange
sounds
as
the
sparks
fly
about
heaping
on
more
turf
and
shifting
the
caldron
so
that
it
may
receive
the
full
influence
of
the
flame
the
hag
proceeds
to
one
of
the
chests
and
takes
out
sundry
small
matters
which
she
places
one
by
one
with
great
care
on
the
table
the
raven
has
now
fixed
his
great
talons
on
her
shoulder
and
chuckles
and
croaks
in
her
ear
as
she
pursues
her
occupation
suddenly
a
piece
of
bone
attracts
his
attention
and
darting
out
his
beak
he
seizes
it
and
hops
away
give
me
that
scalp
thou
mischievous
imp
cries
the
hag
i
need
it
for
the
charm
i
am
about
to
prepare
give
it
me
i
say
but
the
raven
still
held
it
fast
and
hopped
here
and
there
so
nimbly
that
she
was
unable
to
catch
him
at
length
when
he
had
exhausted
her
patience
he
alighted
on
mistress
nutter
shoulder
and
dropped
it
into
her
lap
engrossed
by
her
own
painful
thoughts
the
lady
had
paid
no
attention
to
what
was
passing
and
she
shuddered
as
she
took
up
the
fragment
of
mortality
and
placed
it
upon
the
table
a
few
tufts
of
hair
the
texture
of
which
showed
they
had
belonged
to
a
female
still
adhered
to
the
scalp
mistress
nutter
regarded
it
fixedly
and
with
an
interest
for
which
she
could
not
account
after
sharply
chiding
the
raven
mother
chattox
put
forth
her
hand
to
grasp
the
prize
she
had
been
robbed
of
when
mistress
nutter
checked
her
by
observing
you
said
you
got
this
scalp
from
goldshaw
churchyard
know
you
ought
concerning
it
ay
a
good
deal
replied
the
old
woman
chuckling
it
comes
from
a
grave
near
the
and
not
far
from
abbot
cliderhow
cross
old
zachariah
worms
the
sexton
digged
it
up
for
me
that
yellow
skull
had
once
a
fair
face
attached
to
it
and
those
few
dull
tufts
were
once
bright
flowing
tresses
she
who
owned
them
died
young
but
young
as
she
was
she
survived
all
her
beauty
hollow
cheeks
and
hollow
eyes
wasted
flesh
and
cruel
cough
were
hers
and
she
pined
and
pined
away
folks
said
she
was
forespoken
and
that
i
had
done
it
i
forsooth
she
had
never
done
me
harm
you
know
whether
i
was
rightly
accused
madam
take
it
away
cried
mistress
nutter
hurriedly
and
as
if
struggling
against
some
overmastering
feeling
i
can
not
bear
to
look
at
it
i
wanted
not
this
horrible
reminder
of
my
crimes
this
was
the
reason
then
why
ralph
stole
the
scalp
from
me
muttered
the
hag
as
she
threw
it
together
with
some
other
matters
into
the
caldron
he
wanted
to
show
you
his
sagacity
i
might
have
guessed
as
much
i
will
go
into
the
other
room
while
you
make
your
preparations
said
mistress
nutter
rising
the
sight
of
them
disturbs
me
you
can
summon
me
when
you
are
ready
i
will
madam
replied
the
old
hag
and
you
must
control
your
impatience
for
the
spell
requires
time
for
its
confection
mistress
nutter
made
no
reply
but
walking
into
the
inner
room
closed
the
door
and
threw
herself
upon
the
pallet
here
despite
her
anxiety
sleep
stole
upon
her
and
though
her
dreams
were
troubled
she
did
not
awake
till
mother
chattox
stood
beside
her
have
i
slept
long
she
inquired
more
than
three
hours
replied
the
hag
three
hours
exclaimed
mistress
nutter
why
did
you
not
wake
me
before
you
would
have
saved
me
from
terrible
dreams
we
are
not
too
late
no
no
replied
mother
chattox
there
is
plenty
of
time
come
into
the
other
room
all
is
ready
as
mistress
nutter
followed
the
old
hag
into
the
adjoining
room
a
strong
odour
arising
from
a
in
which
herbs
roots
and
other
ingredients
were
burning
assailed
her
and
versed
in
all
weird
ceremonials
she
knew
that
a
powerful
suffumigation
had
been
made
though
with
what
intent
she
had
yet
to
learn
the
scanty
furniture
had
been
cleared
away
and
a
circle
was
described
on
the
clay
floor
by
skulls
and
bones
alternated
by
dried
toads
adders
and
other
reptiles
in
the
midst
of
this
magical
circle
the
caldron
which
had
been
brought
from
the
chimney
was
placed
and
the
lid
being
removed
a
thick
vapour
arose
from
it
mistress
nutter
looked
around
for
the
raven
but
the
bird
was
nowhere
to
be
seen
nor
did
any
other
living
thing
appear
to
be
present
beside
themselves
taking
the
lady
hand
mother
chattox
drew
her
into
the
circle
and
began
to
mutter
a
spell
after
which
still
maintaining
her
hold
of
her
companion
she
bade
her
look
into
the
caldron
and
declare
what
she
saw
i
see
nothing
replied
the
lady
after
she
had
gazed
upon
the
bubbling
waters
for
a
few
moments
ah
yes
i
discern
certain
figures
but
they
are
confused
by
the
steam
and
broken
by
the
agitation
of
the
water
caldron
cease
boiling
and
smoke
disperse
cried
mother
chattox
stamping
her
foot
now
can
you
see
more
plainly
i
can
replied
mistress
nutter
i
behold
the
subterranean
chamber
beneath
malkin
tower
with
its
nine
ponderous
columns
its
altar
in
the
midst
of
them
its
demon
image
and
the
well
with
waters
black
as
lethe
beside
it
the
water
within
the
caldron
came
from
that
well
said
mother
chattox
with
a
chuckling
laugh
my
familiar
risked
his
liberty
to
bring
it
but
he
succeeded
ha
ha
my
precious
fancy
thou
art
the
best
of
servants
and
shalt
have
my
best
blood
to
reward
thee
thou
shalt
my
sweetheart
my
chuck
my
dandyprat
but
hie
thee
back
to
malkin
tower
and
contrive
that
this
lady
may
hear
as
well
as
see
all
that
passes
away
mistress
nutter
concluded
that
the
injunction
would
be
obeyed
but
as
the
familiar
was
invisible
to
her
she
could
not
detect
his
departure
do
you
see
no
one
within
the
dungeon
inquired
mother
chattox
ah
yes
exclaimed
the
lady
i
have
at
last
discovered
alizon
she
was
behind
one
of
the
pillars
a
little
girl
is
with
her
it
is
jennet
device
and
from
the
spiteful
looks
of
the
latter
i
judge
she
is
mocking
her
oh
what
malice
lurks
in
the
breast
of
that
hateful
child
she
is
a
true
descendant
of
mother
demdike
but
alizon
sweet
patient
alizon
she
seems
to
bear
all
her
taunts
with
a
meekness
and
resignation
enough
to
move
the
hardest
heart
i
would
weep
for
her
if
i
could
and
now
jennet
shakes
her
hand
at
her
and
leaves
her
she
is
alone
what
will
she
do
now
has
she
no
thoughts
of
escape
oh
yes
she
looks
about
her
distractedly
runs
round
the
vault
tries
the
door
of
every
cell
they
are
all
bolted
and
barred
there
is
no
outlet
none
what
next
inquired
the
hag
she
shrieks
aloud
rejoined
mistress
nutter
and
the
cry
thrills
through
every
fibre
in
my
frame
she
calls
upon
me
for
aid
upon
me
her
mother
and
little
thinks
i
hear
her
and
am
unable
to
help
her
oh
it
is
horrible
take
me
to
her
good
chattox
take
me
to
her
i
implore
you
impossible
replied
the
hag
you
must
await
the
fitting
time
if
you
can
not
control
yourself
i
shall
remove
the
caldron
oh
no
no
cried
the
distracted
lady
i
will
be
calm
ah
what
is
this
i
see
she
added
belying
her
former
words
by
sudden
vehemence
while
rage
and
astonishment
were
depicted
upon
her
countenance
what
infernal
delusion
is
practised
upon
my
child
this
is
monstrous
intolerable
oh
that
i
could
undeceive
her
could
warn
her
of
the
snare
what
is
the
nature
of
the
delusion
asked
mother
chattox
with
some
curiosity
i
am
so
blind
i
can
not
see
the
figures
on
the
water
it
is
an
evil
spirit
in
my
likeness
replied
mistress
nutter
in
your
likeness
exclaimed
the
hag
a
cunning
device
and
worthy
of
old
demdike
ho
ho
i
can
scarce
bear
to
look
on
cried
mistress
nutter
but
i
must
though
it
tears
my
heart
in
pieces
to
witness
such
cruelty
the
poor
girl
has
rushed
to
her
false
parent
has
thrown
her
arms
around
her
and
is
weeping
on
her
shoulder
oh
it
is
a
maddening
sight
but
it
is
nothing
to
what
follows
the
temptress
with
the
subtlety
of
the
old
serpent
is
pouring
lies
into
her
ear
telling
her
they
both
are
captives
and
both
will
perish
unless
she
consents
to
purchase
their
deliverance
at
the
price
of
her
soul
and
she
offers
her
a
bond
to
sign
such
a
bond
as
alas
thou
and
i
chattox
have
signed
but
alizon
rejects
it
with
horror
and
gazes
at
her
false
mother
as
if
she
suspected
the
delusion
but
the
temptress
is
not
to
be
beaten
thus
she
renews
her
entreaties
casts
herself
on
the
ground
and
clasps
my
child
knees
in
humblest
supplication
oh
that
alizon
would
place
her
foot
upon
her
neck
and
crush
her
but
it
is
not
so
the
good
act
she
raises
her
and
tells
her
she
will
willingly
die
for
her
but
her
soul
was
given
to
her
by
her
creator
and
must
be
returned
to
him
oh
that
i
had
thought
of
this
and
what
answer
makes
the
spirit
asked
the
witch
it
laughs
derisively
replied
mistress
nutter
and
proceeds
to
use
all
those
sophistical
arguments
which
we
have
so
often
heard
to
pervert
her
mind
and
overthrow
her
principles
but
alizon
is
proof
against
them
all
religion
and
virtue
support
her
and
make
her
more
than
a
match
for
her
opponent
equally
vain
are
the
spirit
attempts
to
seduce
her
by
the
offer
of
a
life
of
sinful
enjoyment
she
rejects
it
with
angry
scorn
failing
in
argument
and
entreaty
the
spirit
now
endeavours
to
work
upon
her
fears
and
paints
in
appalling
colours
the
tortures
she
will
have
to
endure
contrasting
them
with
the
delight
she
is
voluntarily
abandoning
with
the
lover
she
might
espouse
with
the
high
worldly
position
she
might
fill
are
worldly
joys
and
honours
compared
with
those
of
heaven
exclaims
alizon
would
not
exchange
them
the
spirit
then
in
a
vision
shows
her
her
lover
richard
and
asks
her
if
she
can
resist
his
entreaties
the
trial
is
very
sore
as
she
gazes
on
that
beloved
form
seeming
by
its
passionate
gestures
to
implore
her
to
assent
but
she
is
firm
and
the
vision
disappears
the
ordeal
is
now
over
alizon
has
triumphed
over
all
their
arts
the
spirit
in
my
likeness
resumes
its
fiendish
shape
and
with
a
dreadful
menace
against
the
poor
girl
vanishes
from
her
sight
mother
demdike
has
not
done
with
her
yet
observed
chattox
you
are
right
replied
mistress
nutter
the
old
hag
descends
the
staircase
leading
to
the
vault
and
approaches
the
miserable
captive
with
her
there
are
no
supplications
no
arguments
but
commands
and
terrible
threats
she
is
as
unsuccessful
as
her
envoy
alizon
has
gained
courage
and
defies
her
ha
does
she
so
exclaimed
mother
chattox
i
am
glad
of
it
the
solid
floor
resounds
with
the
stamping
of
the
enraged
witch
pursued
mistress
nutter
she
tells
alizon
she
will
take
her
to
pendle
hill
at
midnight
and
there
offer
her
up
as
a
sacrifice
to
the
fiend
my
child
replies
that
she
trusts
for
her
deliverance
to
heaven
that
her
body
may
be
destroyed
that
her
soul
can
not
be
harmed
scarcely
are
the
words
uttered
than
a
terrible
clangour
is
heard
the
walls
of
the
dungeon
seem
breaking
down
and
the
ponderous
columns
reel
the
demon
statue
rises
on
its
throne
and
a
stream
of
flame
issues
from
its
brow
the
doors
of
the
cells
burst
open
and
with
the
clanking
of
chains
and
other
dismal
noises
skeleton
shapes
stalk
forth
from
them
each
with
a
pale
blue
light
above
its
head
monstrous
beasts
like
with
rough
black
skins
and
flaming
eyes
are
moving
about
and
looking
as
if
they
would
spring
upon
the
captive
two
gravestones
are
now
pushed
aside
and
from
the
cold
earth
arise
the
forms
of
blackburn
the
robber
and
his
paramour
the
dissolute
isole
de
heton
she
joins
the
grisly
throng
now
approaching
the
distracted
girl
who
falls
insensible
to
the
ground
can
you
see
aught
more
asked
the
hag
as
mistress
nutter
still
bent
eagerly
over
the
caldron
no
the
whole
chamber
is
buried
in
darkness
replied
the
lady
i
can
see
nothing
of
my
poor
child
what
will
become
of
her
i
will
question
fancy
replied
the
hag
throwing
some
fresh
ingredients
into
the
and
as
the
smoke
arose
she
vociferated
come
hither
fancy
i
want
thee
my
fondling
my
sweet
come
quickly
ha
thou
art
here
the
familiar
was
still
invisible
to
mistress
nutter
but
a
slight
sound
made
her
aware
of
his
presence
and
now
my
sweet
fancy
pursued
the
hag
tell
us
if
thou
canst
what
will
be
done
with
alizon
and
what
course
we
must
pursue
to
free
her
from
old
demdike
at
present
she
is
in
a
state
of
insensibility
replied
a
harsh
voice
and
she
will
be
kept
in
that
condition
till
she
is
conveyed
to
the
summit
of
pendle
hill
i
have
already
told
you
it
is
useless
to
attempt
to
take
her
from
malkin
tower
it
is
too
well
guarded
your
only
chance
will
be
to
interrupt
the
sacrifice
but
how
my
sweet
fancy
how
my
little
darling
inquired
the
hag
it
is
a
perplexing
question
replied
the
voice
for
by
showing
you
how
to
obtain
possession
of
the
girl
i
disobey
my
lord
ay
but
you
serve
me
you
please
me
my
pretty
fancy
cried
the
hag
you
shall
quaff
your
fill
of
blood
on
the
morrow
if
you
do
this
for
me
i
want
to
get
rid
of
my
old
enemy
to
catch
her
in
her
own
toils
to
send
her
to
a
dungeon
to
burn
her
ha
ha
you
must
help
me
my
little
sweetheart
i
will
do
all
i
can
replied
the
voice
but
mother
demdike
is
cunning
and
powerful
and
high
in
favour
with
my
lord
you
must
have
mortal
aid
as
well
as
mine
the
officers
of
justice
must
be
there
to
seize
her
at
the
moment
when
the
victim
is
snatched
from
her
or
she
will
baffle
all
your
schemes
and
how
shall
we
accomplish
this
asked
mother
chattox
i
will
tell
you
said
mistress
nutter
to
the
hag
let
him
put
on
the
form
of
richard
assheton
and
in
that
guise
hasten
to
rough
lee
where
he
will
find
the
young
man
cousin
nicholas
to
whom
he
must
make
known
the
dreadful
deed
about
to
be
enacted
on
pendle
hill
nicholas
will
at
once
engage
to
interrupt
it
he
can
arm
himself
with
the
weapons
of
justice
by
taking
with
him
roger
nowell
the
magistrate
and
his
myrmidon
potts
the
attorney
both
of
whom
are
detained
prisoners
in
the
house
by
my
orders
the
scheme
promises
well
and
shall
be
adopted
replied
the
hag
but
suppose
richard
himself
should
appear
first
on
the
scene
dost
know
where
he
is
my
sweet
fancy
when
i
last
saw
him
replied
the
voice
he
was
lying
senseless
on
the
ground
at
the
foot
of
malkin
tower
having
been
precipitated
from
the
doorway
by
mother
demdike
you
need
apprehend
no
interference
from
him
it
is
well
replied
mother
chattox
then
take
his
form
my
pet
though
it
is
not
half
as
handsome
as
thy
own
a
black
skin
and
limbs
are
to
thy
taste
i
know
replied
the
familiar
with
a
laugh
let
me
look
upon
him
before
he
goes
that
i
may
be
sure
the
likeness
is
exact
said
mistress
nutter
thou
hearest
fancy
become
visible
to
her
cried
the
hag
and
as
she
spoke
a
figure
in
all
respects
resembling
richard
stood
before
them
what
think
you
of
him
will
he
do
said
mother
chattox
ay
replied
the
lady
and
now
send
him
off
at
once
there
is
no
time
to
lose
i
shall
be
there
in
the
twinkling
of
an
eye
said
the
familiar
but
i
own
i
like
not
the
task
there
is
no
help
for
it
my
sweet
fancy
cried
the
hag
i
can
not
forego
my
triumph
over
old
demdike
now
away
with
thee
and
when
thou
hast
executed
thy
mission
return
and
tell
us
how
thou
hast
sped
in
the
matter
the
familiar
promised
obedience
to
her
commands
and
disappeared
chapter
how
rough
lee
was
again
besieged
parson
holden
it
will
be
remembered

charged
by
potts
with
a
message
to
sir
ralph
assheton
informing
him
of
his
detention

that
of
roger
nowell
by

to
their
assistance

delay
congratulating
himself
on
his
escape
but
apprehensive
of
pursuit
the
worthy
rector
who
as
a
keen
huntsman
was
extremely
well
mounted
made
the
best
of
his
way
and
had
already
passed
the
gloomy
gorge
through
which
pendle
water
swept
had
climbed
the
hill
beyond
it
and
was
crossing
the
moor
now
alone
lying
between
him
and
goldshaw
when
he
heard
a
shout
behind
him
and
turning
at
the
sound
beheld
blackadder
and
another
mounted
issuing
from
a
thicket
and
spurring
furiously
after
him
relying
upon
the
speed
of
his
horse
he
disregarded
their
cries
and
accelerated
his
pace
but
in
spite
of
this
his
pursuers
gained
upon
him
rapidly
while
debating
the
question
of
resistance
or
surrender
the
rector
descried
bess
whitaker
coming
towards
him
from
the
opposite
direction
a
circumstance
that
greatly
rejoiced
him
for
aware
of
her
strength
and
courage
he
felt
sure
he
could
place
as
much
dependence
upon
her
in
this
emergency
as
on
any
man
in
the
county
bess
was
riding
a
stout
nag
apparently
well
able
to
sustain
her
weight
and
carried
the
redoubtable
horsewhip
with
her
on
the
other
hand
holden
had
been
recognised
by
bess
who
came
up
just
as
he
was
overtaken
and
seized
by
his
assailants
one
of
whom
caught
hold
of
his
cassock
and
tore
it
from
his
back
while
the
other
seizing
hold
of
his
bridle
endeavoured
in
spite
of
his
efforts
to
the
contrary
to
turn
his
horse
round
many
oaths
threats
and
blows
were
exchanged
during
the
scuffle
which
no
doubt
would
have
terminated
in
the
rector
defeat
and
his
compulsory
return
to
rough
lee
had
it
not
been
for
the
opportune
arrival
of
bess
who
swearing
as
lustily
as
the
and
brandishing
the
horsewhip
dashed
into
the
scene
of
action
and
with
a
few
cuts
liberated
the
divine
enraged
at
her
interference
and
smarting
from
the
application
of
the
whip
blackadder
drew
a
petronel
from
his
girdle
and
levelled
it
at
her
head
but
ere
he
could
discharge
it
the
weapon
was
stricken
from
his
grasp
and
a
second
blow
on
the
head
from
the
of
the
whip
felled
him
from
his
horse
seeing
the
fate
of
his
companion
the
other
fled
leaving
bess
mistress
of
the
field
the
rector
thanked
her
heartily
for
the
service
she
had
rendered
him
and
complimented
her
on
her
prowess

said
the
rector
but
what
is
to
be
done
with
this
fellow
he
added
pointing
to
blackadder
who
though
badly
hurt
was
trying
to
creep
towards
the
petronel
which
was
lying
at
a
little
distance
from
him
on
the
ground
perceiving
his
intention
bess
quickly
dismounted
and
possessing
herself
of
the
weapon
stepped
aside
and
slipping
off
one
of
the
bands
that
confined
the
hose
on
her
leg
grasped
the
wounded
man
by
the
shoulders
and
with
great
expedition
tied
his
hands
behind
his
back
she
then
lifted
him
up
with
as
much
ease
as
if
he
had
been
an
infant
and
set
him
upon
his
horse
with
his
face
towards
the
tail
this
done
she
gave
the
bridle
to
the
rector
and
handing
him
the
petronel
at
the
same
time
told
him
to
take
care
of
his
prisoner
for
she
must
pursue
her
journey
and
with
this
in
spite
of
his
renewed
entreaties
that
she
would
go
back
with
him
she
sprang
on
her
horse
and
rode
off
on
arriving
at
goldshaw
with
his
prisoner
the
rector
at
once
proceeded
to
the
hostel
in
front
of
which
he
found
several
of
the
villagers
assembled
attracted
by
the
numerous
company
within
doors
whose
shouts
and
laughter
could
be
heard
at
a
considerable
distance
appearance
with
blackadder
occasioned
considerable
surprise
and
all
eagerly
gathered
round
him
to
learn
what
had
occurred
but
without
satisfying
their
curiosity
beyond
telling
them
he
had
been
attacked
by
the
prisoner
he
left
him
in
their
custody
and
entered
the
house
where
he
found
all
the
benches
in
the
principal
room
occupied
by
a
crew
of
roysterers
with
flagons
of
ale
before
them
for
after
bess
departure
with
the
key
they
had
broken
into
the
cellar
and
broaching
a
cask
helped
themselves
to
its
contents
various
weapons
were
scattered
about
the
tables
or
reared
against
the
walls
and
the
whole
scene
looked
like
a
carouse
by
a
band
of
marauders
little
respect
was
shown
the
rector
and
he
was
saluted
by
many
a
ribald
jest
as
he
pushed
his
way
towards
the
inner
room
sir
thomas
was
drinking
with
a
couple
of
desperadoes
whose
long
rapiers
and
tarnished
military
equipments
seemed
to
announce
that
they
had
at
some
time
or
other
belonged
to
the
army
though
their
ruffianly
looks
and
braggadocio
air
and
discourse
strongly
seasoned
with
oaths
and
slang
made
it
evident
that
they
were
now
little
better
than
alsatian
bullies
they
had
in
fact
been
hired
by
sir
thomas
for
the
expedition
on
which
he
was
bent
as
he
could
find
no
one
in
the
country
upon
whom
he
could
so
well
count
as
on
them
eyeing
the
rector
fiercely
as
he
intruded
upon
their
privacy
they
glanced
at
their
leader
to
ask
whether
they
should
turn
him
out
but
receiving
no
encouragement
for
such
rudeness
they
contented
themselves
with
scowling
at
him
from
beneath
their
bent
brows
twisting
up
their
shaggy
mustaches
and
trifling
with
the
hilts
of
their
rapiers
holden
opened
his
business
at
once
and
as
soon
as
sir
thomas
heard
it
he
sprang
to
his
feet
and
swearing
a
great
oath
declared
he
would
storm
rough
lee
and
burn
it
to
the
ground
if
mistress
nutter
did
not
set
the
two
captives
free
as
to
the
audacious
witch
herself
i
will
carry
her
off
in
spite
of
the
devil
her
master
he
cried
how
say
you
captain
gauntlet
and
you
too
captain
storks
is
not
this
an
expedition
to
your
tastes
ha
the
two
worthies
appealed
to
responded
joyously
that
it
was
so
and
it
was
then
agreed
that
blackadder
should
be
brought
in
and
interrogated
as
some
important
information
might
be
obtained
from
him
upon
this
captain
gauntlet
left
the
room
to
fetch
him
and
presently
afterwards
returned
dragging
in
the
prisoner
who
looked
dogged
and
angry
by
the
shoulders
harkye
fellow
said
sir
thomas
sternly
if
you
do
not
answer
the
questions
i
shall
put
to
you
truly
and
satisfactorily
i
will
have
you
taken
out
into
the
yard
and
shot
like
a
dog
thus
much
premised
i
shall
proceed
with
my
examination
master
roger
nowell
and
master
thomas
potts
you
are
aware
are
unlawfully
detained
prisoners
by
mistress
alice
nutter
now
i
have
been
called
upon
by
the
reverend
gentleman
here
to
undertake
their
liberation
but
before
doing
so
i
desire
to
know
from
you
what
defensive
and
offensive
preparations
your
mistress
has
made
and
whether
you
judge
it
likely
she
will
attempt
to
hold
out
her
house
against
us
most
assuredly
she
will
replied
blackadder
and
against
twice
your
force
rough
lee
is
as
strong
as
a
castle
and
as
those
within
it
are
vigilant
and
of
good
courage
there
is
little
fear
of
its
capture
if
your
worship
should
propose
terms
to
my
mistress
for
the
release
of
her
prisoners
she
may
possibly
assent
to
them
but
if
you
approach
her
in
hostile
fashion
and
demand
their
liberation
i
am
well
assured
she
will
resist
you
and
well
assured
also
she
will
resist
you
effectually
i
shall
approach
her
in
no
other
sort
than
that
of
an
enemy
rejoined
sir
thomas
but
thou
art
over
confident
knave
unless
thy
mistress
have
a
legion
of
devils
at
her
back
and
they
hold
us
in
check
we
will
force
a
way
into
her
dwelling
fire
and
fury
dost
presume
to
laugh
at
me
fellow
take
him
hence
and
let
him
be
soundly
cudgeled
for
his
insolence
gauntlet
pardon
me
your
worship
cried
blackadder
i
only
smiled
at
the
strange
notions
you
entertain
of
my
mistress
why
dost
mean
to
deny
that
she
is
a
witch
demanded
metcalfe
nay
if
your
worship
will
have
it
so
it
is
not
for
me
to
contradict
you
replied
blackadder
but
i
ask
thee
is
she
not
a
servant
of
satan
dost
thou
not
know
it
canst
thou
not
prove
it
cried
the
knight
shall
we
put
him
to
the
torture
to
make
him
confess
ay
tie
his
thumbs
together
till
the
blood
burst
forth
sir
thomas
said
gauntlet
or
hang
him
up
to
yon
beam
by
the
heels
suggested
captain
storks
on
no
account
interposed
holden
i
did
not
bring
him
hither
to
be
dealt
with
in
this
way
and
i
will
not
permit
it
if
torture
is
to
be
administered
it
must
be
by
the
hands
of
justice
into
which
i
require
him
to
be
delivered
and
then
if
he
can
testify
aught
against
his
mistress
he
will
be
made
to
do
it
torture
shall
never
wring
a
word
from
me
whether
wrongfully
or
rightfully
applied
said
blackadder
doggedly
though
i
could
tell
much
if
i
chose
now
give
heed
to
me
sir
thomas
you
will
never
take
rough
lee
still
less
its
mistress
without
my
help
what
are
thy
terms
knave
exclaimed
the
knight
pondering
upon
the
offer
and
take
heed
thou
triflest
not
with
me
or
i
will
have
thee
flogged
within
an
inch
of
thy
life
in
spite
of
parson
or
justice
what
are
thy
terms
i
repeat
they
are
for
your
worship
ear
alone
replied
blackadder
beware
what
you
do
sir
thomas
interposed
holden
i
hold
it
my
duty
to
tell
you
you
are
compromising
justice
in
listening
to
the
base
proposals
of
this
man
who
while
offering
to
betray
his
mistress
will
assuredly
deceive
you
you
will
equally
deceive
him
in
feigning
to
agree
to
terms
which
you
can
not
fulfil
can
not
fulfil
ejaculated
the
knight
highly
offended
i
would
have
you
to
know
sir
that
sir
thomas
metcalfe
word
is
his
bond
and
that
whatsoever
he
promises
he
fulfil
in
spite
of
the
devil
body
me
but
for
the
respect
i
owe
your
cloth
i
would
give
you
a
very
different
answer
reverend
sir
but
since
you
have
chosen
to
thrust
yourself
unasked
into
the
affair
i
take
leave
to
say
that
i
hear
this
knave
proposals
and
judge
for
myself
of
the
expediency
of
acceding
to
them
i
must
pray
you
therefore
to
withdraw
nay
if
you
will
not
go
hence
peaceably
you
shall
perforce
take
him
away
gentlemen
thus
enjoined
the
alsatian
captains
took
each
an
arm
of
the
rector
and
forced
him
out
of
the
room
leaving
sir
thomas
alone
with
the
prisoner
greatly
incensed
at
the
treatment
he
had
experienced
holden
instantly
quitted
the
house
hastened
to
the
rectory
which
adjoined
the
church
and
having
given
some
messages
to
his
household
rode
off
to
whalley
with
the
intention
of
acquainting
sir
ralph
assheton
with
all
that
had
occurred
sir
thomas
metcalfe
remained
closeted
with
the
prisoner
for
a
few
minutes
and
then
coming
forth
issued
orders
that
all
should
get
ready
to
start
for
rough
lee
without
delay
whereupon
each
man
emptied
his
flagon
pocketed
the
dice
he
had
been
cogging
pushed
aside
the
left
the
loggats
on
the
clay
floor
of
the
barn
and
grasping
his
weapon
halbert
or
caliver
as
it
might
be
prepared
to
attend
his
leader
sir
thomas
did
not
relate
even
to
the
alsatian
captains
what
had
passed
between
him
and
blackadder
but
it
did
not
appear
that
he
placed
entire
confidence
in
the
latter
for
though
he
caused
his
hands
to
be
unbound
and
allowed
him
in
consideration
of
his
wounded
state
to
ride
he
secretly
directed
gauntlet
and
storks
to
keep
near
him
and
shoot
him
through
the
head
if
he
attempted
to
escape
both
these
personages
were
provided
with
horses
as
well
as
their
leader
but
all
the
rest
of
the
party
were
on
foot
metcalfe
made
some
inquiries
after
the
rector
but
finding
he
was
gone
he
did
not
concern
himself
further
about
him
before
starting
the
knight
who
with
all
his
recklessness
had
a
certain
sense
of
honesty
called
the
girl
who
had
been
left
in
charge
of
the
hostel
by
bess
and
gave
her
a
sum
amply
sufficient
to
cover
all
the
excesses
of
his
men
adding
a
handsome
gratuity
to
herself
the
first
part
of
the
journey
was
accomplished
without
mischance
and
the
party
bade
fair
to
arrive
at
the
end
of
it
in
safety
but
as
they
entered
the
gorge
at
the
extremity
of
which
rough
lee
was
situated
a
terrific
storm
burst
upon
them
compelling
them
to
seek
shelter
in
the
mill
from
which
they
were
luckily
not
far
distant
at
the
time
the
house
was
completely
deserted
but
they
were
well
able
to
shift
for
themselves
and
not
over
scrupulous
in
the
manner
of
doing
so
and
as
the
remains
of
the
funeral
feast
were
not
removed
from
the
table
some
of
the
company
sat
down
to
them
while
others
found
their
way
to
the
cellar
the
storm
was
of
long
continuance
much
longer
than
was
agreeable
to
sir
thomas
and
he
paced
the
room
to
and
fro
impatiently
ever
and
anon
walking
to
the
window
or
door
to
see
whether
it
had
in
any
degree
abated
and
was
constantly
doomed
to
disappointment
instead
of
diminishing
it
increased
in
violence
and
it
was
now
impossible
to
quit
the
house
with
safety
the
lightning
blazed
the
thunder
rattled
among
the
overhanging
rocks
and
the
swollen
stream
of
pendle
water
roared
at
their
feet
blackadder
was
left
under
the
care
of
the
two
alsatians
but
while
they
had
shielded
their
eyes
from
the
glare
of
the
lightning
he
threw
open
the
window
and
springing
through
it
made
good
his
retreat
in
such
a
storm
it
was
in
vain
to
follow
him
even
if
they
had
dared
to
attempt
it
in
vain
sir
thomas
metcalfe
fumed
and
fretted
in
vain
he
heaped
curses
upon
the
bullies
for
their
negligence
in
vain
he
hurled
menaces
after
the
fugitive
the
former
paid
little
heed
to
his
imprecations
and
the
latter
was
beyond
his
reach
the
notion
began
to
gain
ground
amongst
the
rest
of
the
troop
that
the
storm
was
the
work
of
witchcraft
and
occasioned
general
consternation
even
the
knight
anger
yielded
to
superstitious
fear
and
as
a
terrific
explosion
shook
the
rafters
overhead
and
threatened
to
bring
them
down
upon
him
he
fell
on
his
knees
and
essayed
with
unaccustomed
lips
to
murmur
a
prayer
but
he
was
interrupted
for
amid
the
deep
silence
succeeding
the
awful
crash
a
mocking
laugh
was
heard
and
the
villainous
countenance
of
blackadder
rendered
doubly
hideous
by
the
white
lightning
was
seen
at
the
casement
the
sight
restored
sir
thomas
at
once
drawing
his
sword
he
flew
to
the
window
but
before
he
could
reach
it
blackadder
was
gone
the
next
flash
showed
what
had
befallen
him
in
stepping
backwards
he
tumbled
into
the
and
the
current
increased
in
depth
and
force
by
the
deluging
rain
instantly
swept
him
away
half
an
hour
after
this
the
violence
of
the
storm
had
perceptibly
diminished
and
sir
thomas
and
his
companions
began
to
hope
that
their
speedy
release
was
at
hand
latterly
the
knight
had
abandoned
all
idea
of
attacking
rough
lee
but
with
the
prospect
of
fair
weather
his
courage
returned
and
he
once
more
resolved
to
attempt
it
he
was
moving
about
among
his
followers
striving
to
dispel
their
fears
and
persuade
them
that
the
tempest
was
only
the
result
of
natural
causes
when
the
door
was
suddenly
thrown
open
giving
entrance
to
bess
whitaker
who
bore
the
miller
in
her
arms
she
stared
on
seeing
the
party
assembled
and
knit
her
brows
but
said
nothing
till
she
had
deposited
baldwyn
in
a
seat
when
she
observed
to
sir
thomas
that
he
seemed
to
have
little
scruple
in
taking
possession
of
a
house
in
its
owner
absence
the
knight
excused
himself
for
the
intrusion
by
saying
he
had
been
compelled
by
the
storm
to
take
refuge
there
with
his
followers
a
plea
readily
admitted
by
baldwyn
who
was
now
able
to
speak
for
himself
and
the
miller
next
explained
that
he
had
been
to
rough
lee
and
after
many
perilous
adventures
into
the
particulars
of
which
he
did
not
enter
had
been
brought
away
by
bess
who
had
carried
him
home
that
home
he
now
felt
would
be
a
lonely
and
insecure
one
unless
she
would
consent
to
occupy
it
with
him
and
bess
on
being
thus
appealed
to
affirmed
that
the
only
motive
that
would
induce
her
to
consent
to
such
an
arrangement
would
be
her
desire
to
protect
him
from
his
mischievous
neighbours
while
they
were
thus
discoursing
old
mitton
who
it
appeared
had
followed
them
arrived
wellnigh
exhausted
and
baldwyn
went
in
search
of
some
refreshment
for
him
by
this
time
the
storm
had
sufficiently
cleared
off
to
allow
the
others
to
take
their
departure
and
though
the
miller
and
bess
would
fain
have
dissuaded
the
knight
from
the
enterprise
he
was
not
to
be
turned
aside
but
bidding
his
men
attend
him
set
forth
the
rain
had
ceased
but
it
was
still
very
dark
under
cover
of
the
gloom
however
they
thought
they
could
approach
the
house
unobserved
and
obtain
an
entrance
before
mistress
nutter
could
be
aware
of
their
arrival
in
this
expectation
they
pursued
their
way
in
silence
and
soon
stood
before
the
gates
these
were
fastened
but
as
no
one
appeared
to
be
on
the
watch
sir
thomas
in
a
low
tone
ordered
some
of
his
men
to
scale
the
walls
with
the
intention
of
following
himself
but
scarcely
had
a
head
risen
above
the
level
of
the
brickwork
than
the
flash
of
an
arquebuss
was
seen
and
the
man
jumped
backwards
luckily
just
in
time
to
avoid
the
bullet
that
whistled
over
him
an
alarm
was
then
instantly
given
voices
were
heard
in
the
garden
mingled
with
the
furious
barking
of
hounds
a
bell
was
rung
from
the
upper
part
of
the
house
and
lights
appeared
at
the
windows
meanwhile
some
of
the
men
less
alarmed
than
their
comrade
contrived
to
scramble
over
the
wall
and
were
soon
engaged
hand
to
hand
with
those
on
the
opposite
side
but
not
alone
had
they
to
contend
with
adversaries
like
themselves
the
which
had
done
so
much
execution
during
the
first
attack
upon
the
house
by
roger
nowell
raged
amongst
them
like
so
many
lions
rending
their
limbs
and
seizing
their
throats
to
free
themselves
from
these
formidable
antagonists
was
their
first
business
and
by
dint
of
thrust
from
pike
cut
from
sword
and
ball
from
caliver
they
succeeded
in
slaughtering
two
of
them
and
driving
the
others
badly
wounded
and
savagely
howling
away
in
doing
this
however
they
themselves
had
sustained
considerable
injury
three
of
their
number
were
lying
on
the
ground
in
no
condition
from
their
broken
heads
or
shattered
limbs
for
renewing
the
combat
thus
so
far
as
the
siege
had
gone
success
seemed
to
declare
itself
rather
for
the
defenders
than
the
assailants
when
a
new
impulse
was
given
to
the
latter
by
the
bursting
open
of
the
gates
and
the
sudden
influx
of
sir
thomas
metcalfe
and
the
rest
of
his
troop
the
knight
was
closely
followed
by
the
alsatian
captains
who
with
tremendous
oaths
in
their
mouths
and
slashing
blades
in
their
hands
declared
they
would
make
minced
meat
of
any
one
opposing
their
progress
sir
thomas
was
equally
truculent
in
expression
and
ferocious
in
tone
and
as
the
whole
party
laid
about
them
right
and
left
they
speedily
routed
the
defenders
of
the
garden
and
drove
them
towards
the
house
flushed
by
their
success
the
besiegers
shouted
loudly
and
sir
thomas
roared
out
that
ere
many
minutes
nowell
and
potts
should
be
set
free
and
alice
nutter
captured
but
before
he
could
reach
the
main
door
nicholas
assheton
well
armed
and
attended
by
some
dozen
men
presented
himself
at
it
these
were
instantly
joined
by
the
retreating
party
and
the
whole
offered
a
formidable
array
of
opponents
quite
sufficient
to
check
the
progress
of
the
besiegers
two
or
three
of
the
men
near
nicholas
carried
torches
and
their
light
revealed
the
numbers
on
both
sides
what
is
it
you
sir
thomas
metcalfe
cried
the
squire
do
you
commit
such
outrages
as
this
do
you
break
into
habitations
like
a
robber
rifle
them
and
murder
their
inmates
explain
yourself
sir
or
i
will
treat
you
as
i
would
a
common
plunderer
shoot
you
through
the
head
or
hang
you
to
the
first
tree
if
i
take
you
zounds
and
fury
rejoined
metcalfe
do
you
dare
to
liken
me
to
a
common
robber
and
murderer
take
care
you
do
not
experience
the
same
fate
as
that
with
which
you
threaten
me
with
this
difference
only
that
the
hangman
the
common
hangman
of
lancaster
shall
serve
your
turn
i
am
come
hither
to
arrest
a
notorious
witch
and
to
release
two
gentlemen
who
are
unlawfully
detained
prisoners
by
her
and
if
you
do
not
instantly
deliver
her
up
to
me
and
produce
the
two
individuals
in
question
master
roger
nowell
and
master
potts
i
will
force
my
way
into
the
house
and
all
injury
done
to
those
who
oppose
me
will
rest
on
your
head
the
two
gentlemen
you
have
named
are
perfectly
safe
and
contented
in
their
quarters
replied
nicholas
and
as
to
the
foul
and
false
aspersions
you
have
thrown
out
against
mistress
nutter
i
cast
them
back
in
your
teeth
your
purpose
in
coming
hither
is
to
redress
some
private
wrong
how
is
it
you
have
such
a
rout
with
you
how
is
it
i
behold
two
notorious
bravos
by
your
side
men
who
have
stood
in
the
pillory
and
undergone
other
ignominious
punishment
for
their
offences
you
can
not
answer
and
their
oaths
and
threats
go
for
nothing
i
now
tell
you
sir
thomas
if
you
do
not
instantly
withdraw
your
men
and
quit
these
premises
grievous
consequences
will
ensue
to
you
and
them
i
will
hear
no
more
cried
sir
thomas
infuriated
to
the
last
degree
follow
me
into
the
house
and
spare
none
who
oppose
you
you
are
not
in
yet
cried
nicholas
and
as
he
spoke
a
row
of
pikes
bristled
around
him
holding
the
knight
at
bay
while
a
hook
was
fixed
in
the
doublet
of
each
of
the
alsatian
captains
and
they
were
plucked
forward
and
dragged
into
the
house
this
done
nicholas
and
his
men
quickly
retreated
and
the
door
was
closed
and
barred
upon
the
enraged
and
discomfited
knight
chapter
the
phantom
monk
many
hours
had
passed
by
and
night
had
come
on
a
night
profoundly
dark
richard
was
still
lying
where
he
had
fallen
at
the
foot
of
malkin
tower
for
though
he
had
regained
his
sensibility
he
was
so
bruised
and
shaken
as
to
be
wholly
unable
to
move
his
limbs
stiffened
and
powerless
refused
their
office
and
after
each
unsuccessful
effort
he
sank
back
with
a
groan
his
sole
hope
was
that
mistress
nutter
alarmed
by
his
prolonged
absence
might
come
to
her
daughter
assistance
and
so
discover
his
forlorn
situation
but
as
time
flew
by
and
nothing
occurred
he
gave
himself
up
for
lost
on
a
sudden
the
gloom
was
dispersed
and
a
silvery
light
shed
over
the
scene
the
moon
had
broken
through
a
rack
of
clouds
and
illumined
the
tall
mysterious
tower
and
the
dreary
waste
around
it
with
the
light
a
ghostly
figure
near
him
became
visible
to
richard
which
under
other
circumstances
would
have
excited
terror
in
his
breast
but
which
now
only
filled
him
with
wonder
it
was
that
of
a
cistertian
monk
the
vestments
were
old
and
faded
the
visage
white
and
richard
at
once
recognised
the
phantom
he
had
seen
in
the
at
the
abbey
and
had
afterwards
so
rashly
followed
to
the
conventual
church
it
touched
him
with
its
icy
fingers
and
a
dullness
like
death
shot
through
his
heart
why
dost
thou
trouble
me
thus
unhappy
spirit
said
the
young
man
leave
me
i
adjure
thee
and
let
me
die
in
peace
thou
wilt
not
die
yet
richard
assheton
returned
the
phantom
and
my
intention
is
not
to
trouble
thee
but
to
serve
thee
without
my
aid
thou
wouldst
perish
where
thou
liest
but
i
will
raise
thee
up
and
set
thee
on
thy
way
wilt
thou
help
me
to
liberate
alizon
demanded
richard
do
not
concern
thyself
further
about
her
replied
the
phantom
she
must
pass
through
an
ordeal
with
which
nothing
human
may
interfere
if
she
escape
it
you
will
meet
again
if
not
it
were
better
thou
shouldst
be
in
thy
grave
than
see
her
take
this
phial
drink
thou
the
liquid
it
contains
and
thy
strength
will
return
to
thee
how
do
i
know
thou
art
not
sent
hither
by
mother
demdike
to
tempt
me
demanded
richard
doubtfully
i
have
already
fallen
into
her
snares
he
added
with
a
groan
illustration
the
phantom
monk
i
am
mother
demdike
enemy
and
the
appointed
instrument
of
her
punishment
replied
the
monk
in
a
tone
that
did
not
admit
of
question
drink
and
fear
nothing
richard
obeyed
and
the
next
moment
sprang
to
his
feet
thou
hast
indeed
restored
me
he
cried
i
would
fain
reach
the
secret
entrance
to
the
tower
attempt
it
not
i
charge
thee
cried
the
phantom
but
depart
instantly
for
pendle
hill
wherefore
should
i
go
thither
demanded
richard
thou
wilt
learn
anon
returned
the
monk
i
can
not
tell
thee
more
now
dismount
at
the
foot
of
the
hill
and
proceed
to
the
beacon
thou
it
i
do
replied
richard
there
a
fire
was
lighted
which
was
meant
to
set
all
england
in
a
blaze
and
which
led
many
good
men
to
destruction
said
the
monk
in
a
tone
of
indescribable
sadness
alas
for
him
who
kindled
it
the
offence
is
not
yet
worked
out
but
depart
without
more
delay
and
look
not
back
as
richard
hastened
towards
the
spot
where
he
had
left
merlin
he
fancied
he
was
followed
by
the
phantom
but
obedient
to
the
injunction
he
received
he
did
not
turn
his
head
as
he
mounted
the
horse
who
neighed
cheerily
as
he
drew
near
he
found
he
was
right
in
supposing
the
monk
to
be
behind
him
for
he
heard
his
voice
calling
out
linger
not
by
the
way
to
the
beacon
to
the
beacon
thus
exhorted
the
young
man
dashed
off
and
to
his
great
surprise
found
merlin
as
fresh
as
if
he
had
undergone
no
fatigue
during
the
day
it
would
almost
seem
from
his
spirit
that
he
had
partaken
of
the
same
wondrous
elixir
which
had
revived
his
master
down
the
hill
he
plunged
regardless
of
the
steep
descent
and
soon
entered
the
thicket
where
the
storm
had
fallen
upon
them
and
where
so
many
acts
of
witchcraft
were
performed
now
neither
accident
nor
obstacle
occurred
to
check
the
headlong
pace
of
the
animal
though
the
stones
rattled
after
him
as
he
struck
them
with
his
flying
hoof
the
moonlight
quivered
on
the
branches
of
the
trees
and
on
the
tender
spray
and
all
looked
as
tranquil
and
beautiful
as
it
had
so
lately
been
gloomy
and
disturbed
the
wood
was
passed
and
the
last
and
steepest
descent
cleared
the
little
bridge
was
at
hand
and
beneath
was
pendle
water
rushing
over
its
rocky
bed
and
glittering
like
silver
in
the
moon
rays
but
here
richard
had
wellnigh
received
a
check
a
party
of
armed
men
it
proved
occupied
the
road
leading
to
rough
lee
about
a
from
the
bridge
and
as
soon
as
they
perceived
he
was
taking
the
opposite
course
with
the
apparent
intention
of
avoiding
them
they
shouted
to
him
to
stay
this
shout
made
richard
aware
of
their
presence
for
he
had
not
before
observed
them
as
they
were
concealed
by
the
intervention
of
some
small
trees
but
though
surprised
at
the
circumstance
and
not
without
apprehension
that
they
might
be
there
with
a
hostile
design
to
mistress
nutter
he
did
not
slacken
his
pace
a
horseman
who
appeared
to
be
their
leader
rode
after
him
for
a
short
distance
but
finding
pursuit
futile
he
desisted
pouring
forth
a
volley
of
oaths
and
threats
in
a
voice
that
proclaimed
him
as
sir
thomas
metcalfe
this
discovery
confirmed
richard
in
his
supposition
that
mischief
was
intended
mistress
nutter
but
even
this
conviction
strengthened
by
his
antipathy
to
metcalfe
was
not
sufficiently
strong
to
induce
him
to
stop
promising
himself
to
return
on
the
morrow
and
settle
accounts
with
the
insolent
knight
he
speeded
on
and
passing
the
mill
tracked
the
rocky
gorge
above
it
and
began
to
mount
another
hill
despite
the
ascent
merlin
never
slackened
his
pace
but
though
his
master
would
have
restrained
him
held
on
as
before
but
the
brow
of
the
hill
attained
richard
compelled
him
to
a
brief
halt
by
this
time
the
sky
was
comparatively
clear
but
small
clouds
were
sailing
across
the
heavens
and
at
one
moment
the
moon
would
be
obscured
by
them
and
the
next
burst
forth
with
sudden
effulgence
these
alternations
produced
corresponding
effects
on
the
broad
brown
heathy
plain
extending
below
and
fantastic
shadows
were
cast
upon
it
which
it
needed
not
richard
heated
imagination
to
liken
to
evil
beings
flying
past
the
wind
too
lay
in
the
direction
of
the
north
end
of
pendle
hill
whither
richard
was
about
to
shape
his
course
and
the
shadows
consequently
trooped
off
towards
that
quarter
the
vast
mass
of
pendle
rose
in
gloomy
majesty
before
him
being
thrown
into
shade
except
at
its
crown
where
a
flood
of
radiance
rested
like
an
eagle
swooping
upon
his
prey
richard
descended
into
the
valley
and
like
a
stag
pursued
by
the
huntsman
he
speeded
across
it
neither
dyke
morass
nor
stone
wall
checked
him
or
made
him
turn
aside
and
almost
as
fast
as
the
clouds
hurrying
above
him
and
their
shadows
travelling
at
his
feet
did
he
reach
the
base
of
pendle
hill
making
up
to
a
shed
which
though
empty
luckily
contained
a
wisp
or
two
of
hay
he
turned
merlin
into
it
and
commenced
the
ascent
of
the
hill
on
foot
after
attaining
a
considerable
elevation
he
looked
down
from
the
giddy
heights
upon
the
valley
he
had
just
traversed
a
few
huts
forming
the
little
village
of
barley
lay
sleeping
in
the
moonlight
beneath
him
while
further
off
could
be
just
discerned
goldshaw
with
its
embowered
church
a
line
of
thin
vapour
marked
the
course
of
pendle
water
and
thicker
mists
hovered
over
the
mosses
the
shadows
were
still
passing
over
the
plain
pressing
on
richard
soon
came
among
the
rocks
protruding
from
the
higher
part
of
the
hill
and
as
the
path
was
here
not
more
than
a
foot
wide
rarely
taken
except
by
the
sheep
and
their
guardians
it
was
necessary
to
proceed
with
the
utmost
caution
as
a
single
false
step
would
have
been
fatal
after
some
toil
and
not
without
considerable
risk
he
reached
the
summit
of
the
hill
as
he
bounded
over
the
springy
turf
and
inhaled
the
pure
air
of
that
exalted
region
his
spirits
revived
and
new
elasticity
was
communicated
to
his
limbs
he
shaped
his
course
near
the
edge
of
the
hill
so
that
the
extensive
view
it
commanded
was
fully
displayed
but
his
eye
rested
on
the
mountainous
range
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
valley
where
malkin
tower
was
situated
even
in
broad
day
the
accursed
structure
would
have
been
invisible
as
it
stood
on
the
further
side
of
the
hill
overlooking
barrowford
and
colne
but
richard
knew
its
position
well
and
while
his
gaze
was
fixed
upon
the
point
he
saw
a
star
shoot
down
from
the
heavens
and
apparently
alight
near
the
spot
the
circumstance
alarmed
him
for
he
could
not
help
thinking
it
ominous
of
ill
to
alizon
nothing
however
followed
to
increase
his
misgivings
and
erelong
he
came
in
sight
of
the
beacon
the
ground
had
been
gradually
rising
and
if
he
had
proceeded
a
few
hundred
yards
further
a
vast
panorama
would
have
opened
upon
him
comprising
a
large
part
of
lancashire
on
the
one
hand
and
on
the
other
an
equally
extensive
portion
of
yorkshire
forest
and
fell
black
moor
and
bright
stream
old
castle
and
stately
hall
would
have
then
been
laid
before
him
as
in
a
map
but
other
thoughts
engrossed
him
and
he
went
straight
on
as
far
as
he
could
discern
he
was
alone
on
the
hill
top
and
the
silence
and
solitude
coupled
with
the
ill
report
of
the
place
which
at
this
hour
was
said
to
be
often
visited
by
foul
hags
for
the
performance
of
their
unhallowed
rites
awakened
superstitious
fears
in
his
breast
he
was
soon
by
the
side
of
the
beacon
the
stones
were
still
standing
as
they
had
been
reared
by
paslew
and
on
looking
at
them
he
was
astonished
to
find
the
hollow
within
them
filled
with
dry
furze
brushwood
and
fagots
as
if
in
readiness
for
another
signal
in
passing
round
the
circle
his
surprise
was
still
further
increased
by
discovering
a
torch
and
not
far
from
it
in
one
of
the
interstices
of
the
stones
a
dark
lantern
in
which
on
removing
the
shade
he
found
a
candle
burning
it
was
now
clear
the
beacon
was
to
be
kindled
that
night
though
for
what
end
he
could
not
conjecture
and
equally
clear
that
he
was
brought
thither
to
fire
it
he
put
back
the
lantern
into
its
place
took
up
the
torch
and
held
himself
in
readiness
half
an
hour
elapsed
and
nothing
occurred
during
this
interval
it
had
become
dark
a
curtain
of
clouds
was
drawn
over
the
moon
and
stars
suddenly
a
hurtling
noise
was
heard
in
the
air
and
it
seemed
to
the
watcher
as
if
a
troop
of
witches
were
alighting
at
a
distance
from
him
a
loud
hubbub
of
voices
ensued
then
there
was
a
trampling
of
feet
accompanied
by
discordant
strains
of
music
after
which
a
momentary
silence
ensued
and
a
harsh
voice
asked
why
are
we
brought
hither
it
is
not
for
a
sabbath
shouted
another
voice
for
there
is
neither
fire
nor
caldron
mother
demdike
would
not
summon
us
without
good
reason
cried
a
third
we
shall
learn
presently
what
we
have
to
do
the
more
mischief
the
better
rejoined
another
voice
ay
mischief
mischief
mischief
echoed
the
rest
of
the
crew
you
shall
have
enough
of
it
to
content
you
rejoined
mother
demdike
i
have
called
you
hither
to
be
present
at
a
sacrifice
hideous
screams
of
laughter
followed
this
announcement
and
the
voice
that
had
spoken
first
asked
a
sacrifice
of
whom
an
unbaptised
babe
stolen
from
its
sleeping
mother
breast
rejoined
another
mother
demdike
has
often
played
that
trick
before
ho
ho
peace
thundered
the
hag
it
is
no
babe
i
am
about
to
kill
but
a
maid
ay
and
one
of
rarest
beauty
too
what
think
ye
of
alizon
device
thy
cried
several
voices
in
surprise
alice
nutter
daughter
for
such
she
is
rejoined
the
hag
i
have
held
her
captive
in
malkin
tower
and
have
subjected
her
to
every
trial
and
temptation
i
could
devise
but
i
have
failed
in
shaking
her
courage
or
in
winning
her
over
to
our
master
all
the
horrors
of
the
vault
have
been
tried
upon
her
in
vain
even
the
last
terrible
ordeal
which
no
one
has
hitherto
sustained
proved
ineffectual
she
went
through
it
unmoved
heaven
be
praised
murmured
richard
it
seems
i
have
no
power
over
her
soul
pursued
the
hag
but
i
have
over
her
body
and
she
shall
die
here
and
by
my
hand
but
mind
me
not
a
drop
of
blood
must
fall
to
the
ground
have
no
fear
cried
several
voices
we
will
catch
it
in
our
palms
and
quaff
it
hast
thou
thy
knife
asked
mother
demdike
ay
replied
the
other
it
is
long
and
sharp
and
will
do
thy
business
well
thy
grandson
jem
device
notched
it
by
killing
swine
and
my
goodman
ground
it
only
yesterday
take
it
i
will
plunge
it
to
her
heart
cried
mother
demdike
with
an
infernal
laugh
and
now
i
will
tell
you
why
we
have
neither
fire
nor
caldron
on
questioning
the
ebon
image
in
the
vault
as
to
the
place
where
the
sacrifice
should
be
made
i
received
for
answer
that
it
must
be
here
and
in
darkness
no
human
eye
but
our
own
must
behold
it
we
are
safe
on
this
score
for
no
one
is
likely
to
come
hither
at
this
hour
no
fire
must
be
kindled
or
the
sacrifice
will
result
in
destruction
to
us
all
ye
have
heard
and
understand
we
do
replied
several
husky
voices
and
so
do
i
said
richard
taking
hold
of
the
dark
lantern
and
now
for
the
girl
cried
mother
demdike
chapter
one
mistress
nutter
and
mother
chattox
were
still
at
the
hut
impatiently
awaiting
the
return
of
fancy
but
nearly
an
hour
elapsed
before
he
appeared
what
has
detained
thee
so
long
demanded
the
hag
sharply
as
he
stood
before
them
you
shall
hear
mistress
replied
fancy
i
have
had
a
busy
time
of
it
i
assure
you
and
thought
i
should
never
accomplish
my
errand
on
arriving
at
rough
lee
i
found
the
place
invested
by
sir
thomas
metcalfe
and
a
host
of
armed
men
who
had
been
sent
thither
by
parson
holden
for
the
joint
purpose
of
arresting
you
madam
addressing
mistress
nutter
and
liberating
nowell
and
potts
the
knight
was
in
a
great
fume
for
in
spite
of
the
force
brought
against
it
the
house
had
been
stoutly
defended
by
nicholas
assheton
who
had
worsted
the
besieging
party
and
captured
two
alsatian
captains
hangers
on
of
sir
thomas
appearing
in
the
character
of
an
enemy
i
was
immediately
surrounded
by
metcalfe
and
his
men
who
swore
they
would
cut
my
throat
unless
i
undertook
to
procure
the
liberation
of
the
two
bravos
in
question
as
well
as
that
of
nowell
and
potts
i
told
them
i
was
come
for
the
express
purpose
of
setting
free
the
two
gentlemen
but
with
respect
to
the
former
i
had
no
instructions
and
they
must
arrange
the
matter
with
master
nicholas
himself
upon
this
sir
thomas
became
exceedingly
wroth
and
insolent
and
proceeded
to
such
lengths
that
i
resolved
to
chastise
him
and
in
so
doing
performed
a
feat
which
will
tend
greatly
to
exalt
richard
character
for
courage
and
strength
let
us
hear
it
my
doughty
champion
cried
mother
chattox
while
metcalfe
was
pouring
forth
his
rage
and
menacing
me
with
uplifted
hand
pursued
the
familiar
i
seized
him
by
the
throat
dragged
him
from
his
horse
and
in
spite
of
the
efforts
of
his
men
whose
blows
fell
upon
me
thick
as
hail
and
quite
as
harmlessly
i
bore
him
through
the
garden
to
the
back
of
the
house
where
my
shouts
soon
brought
nicholas
and
others
to
my
assistance
and
after
delivering
my
captive
to
them
i
dismounted
the
squire
you
will
imagine
was
astonished
to
see
me
and
greatly
applauded
my
prowess
i
replied
with
the
modesty
becoming
my
assumed
character
that
i
had
done
nothing
and
in
reality
the
feat
was
nothing
to
me
but
i
told
him
i
had
something
of
the
utmost
importance
to
communicate
and
which
could
not
be
delayed
a
moment
whereupon
he
led
me
to
a
small
room
adjoining
the
hall
while
the
crestfallen
knight
was
left
to
vent
his
rage
and
mortification
on
the
grooms
to
whose
custody
he
was
committed
you
acted
your
part
to
perfection
said
mistress
nutter
ay
trust
my
sweet
fancy
for
that
said
the
hag
there
is
no
familiar
like
him
none
whatever
your
praises
make
me
blush
rejoined
fancy
but
to
proceed
i
fulfilled
your
instructions
to
the
letter
and
excited
nicholas
horror
and
indignation
by
the
tale
i
told
him
i
laughed
in
my
sleeve
all
the
while
but
i
maintained
a
very
different
countenance
with
him
he
thought
me
full
of
anguish
and
despair
he
questioned
me
as
to
my
proceedings
at
malkin
tower
and
i
amazed
him
with
the
description
of
a
fearful
storm
i
had
encountered
of
my
interview
with
old
demdike
and
her
atrocious
treatment
of
alizon
to
all
of
which
he
listened
with
profound
interest
richard
himself
could
not
have
moved
him
more
perhaps
not
so
much
as
soon
as
i
had
finished
he
vowed
he
would
rescue
alizon
from
the
murtherous
hag
and
prevent
the
latter
from
committing
further
mischief
and
bidding
me
come
with
him
we
repaired
to
the
room
in
which
nowell
and
potts
were
confined
we
found
them
both
fast
asleep
in
their
chairs
but
nicholas
quickly
awakened
them
and
some
explanations
ensued
which
did
not
at
first
appear
very
clear
and
satisfactory
to
either
magistrate
or
attorney
but
in
the
end
they
agreed
to
accompany
us
on
the
expedition
master
potts
declaring
it
would
compensate
him
for
all
his
mischances
if
he
could
arrest
mother
demdike
i
hope
he
may
have
his
wish
said
mother
chattox
ay
but
he
declared
that
his
next
step
should
be
to
arrest
you
mistress
observed
fancy
with
a
laugh
arrest
me
cried
the
hag
marry
let
him
touch
me
if
he
dares
my
term
is
not
out
yet
and
with
thee
to
defend
me
my
brave
fancy
i
have
no
fear
right
replied
the
familiar
but
to
go
on
with
my
story
sir
thomas
metcalfe
was
next
brought
forward
and
after
some
warm
altercation
peace
was
at
length
established
between
him
and
the
squire
and
hands
were
shaken
all
round
wine
was
then
called
for
by
nicholas
who
at
the
same
time
directed
that
the
two
alsatian
captains
should
be
brought
up
from
the
cellar
where
they
had
been
placed
for
safety
the
first
part
of
the
order
was
obeyed
but
the
second
was
found
impracticable
inasmuch
as
the
two
heroes
had
found
their
way
to
the
inner
cellar
and
had
emptied
so
many
flasks
that
they
were
utterly
incapable
of
moving
while
the
wine
was
being
discussed
an
unexpected
arrival
took
place
an
arrival
of
whom
inquired
mistress
nutter
eagerly
sir
ralph
assheton
and
a
large
party
replied
fancy
parson
holden
it
seems
not
content
with
sending
sir
thomas
and
his
rout
to
the
aid
of
his
friends
had
proceeded
for
the
same
purpose
to
whalley
and
the
result
was
the
appearance
of
the
new
party
a
brief
explanation
from
nicholas
and
myself
served
to
put
sir
ralph
in
possession
of
all
that
had
occurred
and
he
declared
his
readiness
to
accompany
the
expedition
to
pendle
hill
and
to
take
all
his
followers
with
him
sir
thomas
metcalfe
expressed
an
equally
strong
desire
to
go
with
him
and
of
course
it
was
acceded
to
i
am
bound
to
tell
you
madam
added
fancy
to
mistress
nutter
that
your
conduct
is
viewed
in
a
most
suspicious
light
by
every
one
of
these
persons
except
nicholas
who
made
an
effort
to
defend
you
i
care
not
what
happens
to
me
if
i
succeed
in
rescuing
my
child
said
the
lady
but
have
they
set
out
on
the
expedition
by
this
time
no
doubt
they
have
replied
fancy
i
got
off
by
saying
i
would
ride
on
to
pendle
hill
and
stationing
myself
on
its
summit
give
them
a
signal
when
they
should
advance
upon
their
prey
and
now
good
mistress
i
pray
you
dismiss
me
i
want
to
cast
off
this
shape
which
i
find
an
incumbrance
and
resume
my
own
i
will
return
when
it
is
time
for
you
to
set
out
the
hag
waved
her
hand
and
the
familiar
was
gone
half
an
hour
elapsed
and
he
returned
not
mistress
nutter
became
fearfully
impatient
and
even
the
old
hag
was
uneasy
an
hour
and
he
stood
before
them
dwarfish
fiendish
monstrous
it
is
time
he
said
in
a
harsh
voice
but
the
tones
were
music
in
the
wretched
mother
ears
come
then
she
cried
rushing
wildly
forth
ay
ay
i
come
replied
the
hag
following
her
not
so
fast
you
can
not
go
without
me
nor
either
of
you
without
me
added
fancy
here
good
mistress
is
your
broomstick
away
for
pendle
hill
screamed
the
hag
ay
for
pendle
hill
echoed
fancy
and
there
was
a
whirling
of
dark
figures
through
the
air
as
before
presently
they
alighted
on
the
summit
of
pendle
hill
which
seemed
to
be
wrapped
in
a
dense
cloud
for
mistress
nutter
could
scarcely
see
a
yard
before
her
fancy
eyes
however
were
powerful
enough
to
penetrate
the
gloom
for
stepping
back
a
few
yards
he
said
the
expedition
is
at
the
foot
of
the
hill
where
they
have
made
a
halt
we
must
wait
a
few
moments
till
i
can
ascertain
what
they
mean
to
do
ah
i
see
they
are
dividing
into
three
parties
one
detachment
headed
by
nicholas
assheton
with
whom
are
potts
and
nowell
is
about
to
make
the
ascent
from
the
spot
where
they
now
stand
another
commanded
by
sir
ralph
assheton
is
moving
towards
the
of
the
hill
and
the
third
headed
by
sir
thomas
metcalfe
is
proceeding
to
the
right
these
are
goodly
preparations
ha
ha
but
what
do
i
behold
the
first
detachment
have
a
prisoner
with
them
it
is
jem
device
whom
they
have
captured
on
the
way
i
suppose
i
can
tell
from
the
rascal
looks
that
he
is
planning
an
escape
patience
madam
i
must
see
how
he
executes
his
design
there
is
no
hurry
they
are
all
scrambling
up
the
some
one
slips
and
rolls
down
and
bruises
himself
severely
against
the
loose
stones
ho
ho
it
is
master
potts
he
is
picked
up
by
james
device
who
takes
him
on
his
shoulders
what
means
the
knave
by
such
attention
we
shall
see
anon
they
continue
to
fight
their
way
upward
and
have
now
reached
the
narrow
path
among
the
rocks
take
heed
or
your
necks
will
be
broken
ho
ho
well
done
jem
bravo
lad
thy
scheme
is
out
now
ho
ho
what
has
he
done
asked
mother
chattox
run
off
with
the
attorney
with
master
potts
replied
fancy
disappeared
in
the
gloom
so
that
it
is
impossible
nicholas
can
follow
him
ho
ho
but
my
child
where
is
my
child
cried
mistress
nutter
in
agitated
impatience
come
with
me
and
i
will
lead
you
to
her
replied
fancy
taking
her
hand
and
do
you
keep
close
to
us
mistress
he
added
to
mother
chattox
moving
quickly
along
the
heathy
plain
they
soon
reached
a
small
dry
hollow
about
a
hundred
paces
from
the
beacon
in
the
midst
of
which
as
in
a
grave
was
deposited
the
inanimate
form
of
alizon
when
the
spot
was
indicated
to
her
by
fancy
the
miserable
mother
flew
to
it
and
with
indescribable
delight
clasped
her
child
to
her
breast
but
the
next
moment
a
new
fear
seized
her
for
the
limbs
were
stiff
and
cold
and
the
heart
had
apparently
ceased
to
beat
she
is
dead
exclaimed
mistress
nutter
frantically
no
she
is
only
in
a
magical
trance
said
fancy
my
mistress
can
instantly
revive
her
prithee
do
so
then
good
chattox
implored
the
lady
better
defer
it
till
we
have
taken
her
hence
rejoined
the
hag
oh
no
now
now
let
me
be
assured
she
lives
cried
mistress
nutter
mother
chattox
reluctantly
assented
and
touching
alizon
with
her
skinny
finger
first
upon
the
heart
and
then
upon
the
brow
the
poor
girl
began
to
show
symptoms
of
life
my
child
my
child
cried
mistress
nutter
straining
her
to
her
breast
i
am
come
to
save
thee
you
will
scarce
succeed
if
you
tarry
here
longer
said
fancy
away
ay
come
away
shrieked
the
hag
seizing
alizon
arm
where
are
you
about
to
take
her
asked
mistress
nutter
to
my
hut
replied
mother
chattox
no
no
she
shall
not
go
there
returned
the
lady
and
wherefore
not
screamed
the
hag
she
is
mine
now
and
i
say
she
go
right
mistress
said
fancy
and
leave
the
lady
here
if
she
objects
to
accompany
her
but
be
quick
you
shall
not
take
her
from
me
shrieked
mistress
nutter
holding
her
daughter
fast
i
see
through
your
diabolical
purpose
you
have
the
same
dark
design
as
mother
demdike
and
would
sacrifice
her
but
she
shall
not
go
with
you
neither
will
i
tut
exclaimed
the
hag
you
have
lost
your
senses
on
a
sudden
i
do
not
want
your
daughter
but
come
away
or
mother
demdike
will
surprise
us
do
not
trifle
with
her
longer
whispered
fancy
to
the
hag
drag
the
girl
away
or
you
will
lose
her
a
few
moments
and
it
will
be
too
late
mother
chattox
made
an
attempt
to
obey
him
but
mistress
nutter
resisted
her
curses
on
her
she
muttered
she
is
too
strong
for
me
do
thou
help
me
she
added
appealing
to
fancy
i
can
not
he
replied
i
have
done
all
i
dare
to
help
you
you
must
accomplish
the
rest
yourself
but
my
sweet
imp
recollect
i
recollect
i
have
a
master
interrupted
the
familiar
and
a
mistress
too
cried
the
hag
and
she
will
chastise
thee
if
thou
art
disobedient
i
command
thee
to
carry
off
this
girl
i
have
already
told
you
i
dare
not
and
i
now
say
i
will
not
replied
fancy
will
not
shrieked
the
hag
thou
shalt
smart
for
this
i
will
bury
thee
in
the
heart
of
this
mountain
and
make
thee
labour
within
it
like
a
gnome
i
will
set
thee
to
count
the
sands
on
the
river
bed
and
the
leaves
on
the
forest
trees
thou
shalt
know
neither
rest
nor
respite
ho
ho
ho
laughed
fancy
mockingly
dost
deride
me
cried
the
hag
i
will
do
it
thou
saucy
jackanapes
for
the
last
time
wilt
obey
me
no
replied
fancy
and
for
this
reason
your
term
is
out
it
expired
at
midnight
it
is
false
shrieked
the
hag
in
accents
of
mixed
terror
and
rage
i
have
months
to
run
and
will
renew
it
before
midnight
you
might
have
done
so
but
it
is
now
too
late
your
reign
is
over
rejoined
fancy
farewell
sweet
mistress
we
shall
meet
once
again
though
scarcely
under
such
pleasant
circumstances
as
heretofore
it
can
not
be
my
darling
fancy
thou
art
jesting
with
me
whimpered
the
hag
thou
wouldst
not
delude
thy
doating
mistress
thus
i
have
done
with
thee
foul
hag
rejoined
the
familiar
and
am
right
glad
my
service
is
ended
i
could
have
saved
thee
but
would
not
and
delayed
my
return
for
that
very
purpose
thy
soul
was
forfeited
when
i
came
back
to
thy
hut
then
curses
on
thee
for
thy
treachery
cried
the
hag
and
on
thy
master
who
deceived
me
in
the
bond
he
placed
before
me
the
familiar
laughed
hoarsely
but
what
of
mother
demdike
pursued
the
hag
hast
thou
no
comfort
for
me
tell
me
her
hour
is
likewise
come
and
i
will
forgive
thee
but
do
not
let
her
triumph
over
me
the
familiar
made
no
answer
but
laughing
derisively
stamped
upon
the
ground
and
it
opened
to
receive
him
alizon
cried
mistress
nutter
who
in
the
mean
time
had
vainly
endeavoured
to
rouse
her
daughter
to
full
consciousness
fly
with
me
my
child
the
enemy
is
at
hand
what
enemy
asked
alizon
faintly
i
have
so
many
that
i
know
not
whom
you
mean
but
this
is
the
worst
of
all
this
is
mother
demdike
cried
mistress
nutter
she
would
take
your
life
if
we
can
but
conceal
ourselves
for
a
short
while
we
are
safe
i
am
too
weak
to
move
said
alizon
besides
i
dare
not
trust
you
i
have
been
deceived
already
you
may
be
an
evil
spirit
in
the
likeness
of
my
mother
oh
no
i
am
indeed
your
own
own
mother
rejoined
mistress
nutter
ask
this
old
woman
if
it
is
not
so
she
is
a
witch
herself
replied
alizon
i
will
not
trust
either
of
you
you
are
both
in
league
with
mother
demdike
we
are
in
league
to
save
thee
from
her
foolish
wench
cried
mother
chattox
but
thy
perverseness
will
defeat
all
our
schemes
since
you
will
not
fly
my
child
cried
mistress
nutter
kneel
down
and
pray
earnestly
for
deliverance
pray
while
there
is
yet
time
as
she
spoke
a
growl
like
thunder
was
heard
in
the
air
and
the
earth
trembled
beneath
their
feet
nay
now
i
am
sure
you
are
my
mother
cried
alizon
flinging
herself
into
mistress
nutter
arms
and
i
will
go
with
you
but
before
they
could
move
several
dusky
figures
were
seen
rushing
towards
them
be
on
your
guard
cried
mother
chattox
here
comes
old
demdike
with
her
troop
i
will
aid
you
all
i
can
down
on
your
knees
exclaimed
mistress
nutter
alizon
obeyed
but
ere
a
word
could
pass
her
lips
the
infuriated
hag
attended
by
her
beldame
band
stood
beside
them
ha
who
is
here
she
cried
let
me
see
who
dares
interrupt
my
mystic
rites
and
raising
her
hand
the
black
cloud
hanging
over
the
hill
was
rent
asunder
and
the
moon
shone
down
upon
them
revealing
the
old
witch
armed
with
the
sacrificial
knife
her
limbs
shaking
with
fury
and
her
eyes
flashing
with
preternatural
light
it
revealed
also
her
weird
attendants
as
well
as
the
group
before
her
consisting
of
the
kneeling
figure
of
alizon
protected
by
the
outstretched
arms
of
her
mother
and
further
defended
by
mother
chattox
who
planted
herself
in
front
of
them
mother
demdike
eyed
the
group
for
a
moment
as
if
she
would
annihilate
them
out
of
my
way
chattox
she
vociferated
out
of
my
way
or
i
will
drive
my
knife
to
thy
heart
and
as
her
old
antagonist
maintained
her
ground
she
unhesitatingly
advanced
upon
her
smote
her
with
the
weapon
and
as
she
fell
to
the
ground
stepped
over
her
bleeding
body
now
what
dost
thou
here
alice
nutter
she
cried
menacing
her
with
the
reeking
blade
i
am
come
for
my
child
whom
thou
hast
stolen
from
me
replied
the
lady
thou
art
come
to
witness
her
slaughter
replied
the
witch
fiercely
begone
or
i
will
serve
thee
as
i
have
just
served
old
chattox
i
am
not
sped
yet
cried
the
wounded
hag
i
shall
live
to
see
thee
bound
hand
and
foot
by
the
officers
of
justice
and
certain
thou
wilt
perish
miserably
i
shall
die
content
spit
out
thy
last
drops
of
venom
black
viper
rejoined
mother
demdike
when
i
have
done
with
the
others
i
will
return
and
finish
thee
alice
nutter
thou
knowest
it
is
vain
to
struggle
with
me
give
me
up
the
girl
wilt
thou
accept
my
life
for
hers
said
mistress
nutter
of
what
account
would
thy
life
be
to
me
rejoined
mother
demdike
disdainfully
if
it
would
profit
me
to
take
it
i
would
do
so
without
thy
consent
but
i
am
about
to
make
an
oblation
to
our
master
and
thou
art
his
already
snatch
her
child
from
her
we
waste
time
she
added
to
her
attendants
and
immediately
the
weird
crew
rushed
forward
and
in
spite
of
the
miserable
mother
efforts
tore
alizon
from
her
i
told
you
it
was
in
vain
to
contend
with
me
said
mother
demdike
oh
that
i
could
call
down
heaven
vengeance
upon
thy
accursed
head
cried
mistress
nutter
but
i
am
forsaken
alike
of
god
and
man
and
shall
die
despairing
rave
on
thou
wilt
have
ample
leisure
replied
the
hag
and
now
bring
the
girl
this
way
she
added
to
the
beldames
the
sacrifice
must
be
made
near
the
beacon
and
as
alizon
was
borne
away
mistress
nutter
uttered
a
cry
of
anguish
do
not
stay
here
said
mother
chattox
raising
herself
with
difficulty
go
after
her
you
may
yet
save
your
daughter
but
how
cried
mistress
nutter
distractedly
i
have
no
power
now
as
she
spoke
a
dusky
form
rose
up
beside
her
it
was
her
familiar
will
you
return
to
your
duty
if
i
help
you
in
this
extremity
he
said
ay
do
do
cried
mother
chattox
anything
to
avenge
yourself
upon
that
murtherous
hag
peace
cried
the
familiar
spurning
her
with
his
cloven
foot
i
do
not
want
vengeance
said
mistress
nutter
i
only
want
to
save
my
child
then
you
consent
on
that
condition
said
the
familiar
no
replied
mistress
nutter
firmly
i
now
perceive
i
am
not
utterly
lost
since
you
try
to
regain
me
i
have
renounced
thy
master
and
will
make
no
new
bargain
with
him
get
hence
tempter
think
not
to
escape
us
cried
the
familiar
no
penitence
no
absolution
can
save
thee
thy
name
is
written
on
the
judgment
scroll
and
can
not
be
effaced
i
would
have
aided
thee
but
since
my
offer
is
rejected
i
leave
thee
you
will
not
let
him
go
screamed
mother
chattox
oh
that
the
chance
were
mine
be
silent
or
i
will
beat
thy
brains
out
said
the
familiar
once
more
am
i
dismissed
ay
for
ever
replied
mistress
nutter
and
as
the
familiar
disappeared
she
flew
to
the
spot
where
her
child
had
been
taken
about
twenty
paces
from
the
beacon
a
circle
had
again
been
formed
by
the
unhallowed
crew
in
the
midst
of
which
stood
mother
demdike
with
the
gory
knife
in
her
hand
muttering
spells
and
incantations
and
performing
mystical
ceremonials
every
now
and
then
her
companions
joined
in
these
rites
and
chanted
a
song
couched
in
a
wild
unintelligible
jargon
beside
the
witch
knelt
alizon
with
her
hands
tied
behind
her
back
so
that
she
could
not
raise
them
in
supplication
her
hair
unbound
and
cast
loosely
over
her
person
and
a
thick
bandage
fastened
over
her
eyes
and
mouth
the
initiatory
ceremonies
over
the
old
hag
approached
her
victim
when
mistress
nutter
forced
herself
through
the
circle
and
cast
herself
at
her
feet
spare
her
she
cried
clinging
to
her
knees
it
shall
be
well
for
thee
if
thou
dost
so
again
interrupted
cried
the
witch
furiously
this
time
i
will
show
thee
no
mercy
take
thy
fate
meddlesome
woman
and
she
raised
the
knife
but
ere
the
weapon
could
descend
it
was
seized
by
mistress
nutter
and
wrested
from
her
grasp
in
another
instant
alizon
arms
were
liberated
and
the
bandage
removed
from
her
eyes
now
it
is
my
turn
to
threaten
i
have
thee
in
my
power
infernal
hag
cried
mistress
nutter
holding
the
knife
to
the
witch
throat
and
clasping
her
daughter
with
the
other
arm
wilt
let
us
go
no
replied
mother
demdike
springing
nimbly
backwards
you
shall
both
die
i
will
soon
disarm
thee
and
making
one
or
two
passes
with
her
hands
mistress
nutter
dropped
the
weapon
and
instantly
became
fixed
and
motionless
with
her
daughter
equally
rigid
in
her
arms
they
looked
as
if
suddenly
turned
to
marble
now
to
complete
the
ceremonial
cried
mother
demdike
picking
up
the
knife
and
then
she
began
to
mutter
an
impious
address
preparatory
to
the
sacrifice
when
a
loud
clangour
was
heard
like
the
stroke
of
a
hammer
upon
a
bell
what
was
that
exclaimed
the
witch
in
alarm
were
there
a
clock
here
i
should
say
it
had
struck
one
replied
it
must
be
our
master
timepiece
said
another
witch
one
exclaimed
mother
demdike
who
appeared
stupefied
with
fear
and
the
sacrifice
not
made
then
i
am
lost
a
derisive
laugh
reached
her
ears
it
proceeded
from
mother
chattox
who
had
contrived
to
raise
herself
to
her
feet
and
tottering
forward
now
passed
through
the
appalled
circle
ay
thy
term
is
out
thy
soul
is
forfeited
like
mine
ha
ha
and
she
fell
to
the
ground
perhaps
it
may
not
be
too
late
cried
mother
demdike
grasping
the
knife
and
rushing
towards
alizon
but
at
this
moment
a
bright
flame
shot
up
from
the
beacon
astonishment
and
terror
seized
the
hag
and
she
uttered
a
loud
cry
which
was
echoed
by
the
rest
of
the
crew
the
flame
mounted
higher
and
higher
and
burnt
each
moment
more
brightly
illumining
the
whole
summit
of
the
hill
by
its
light
could
be
seen
a
band
of
men
some
of
whom
were
on
horseback
speeding
towards
the
place
of
meeting
scared
by
the
sight
the
witches
fled
but
were
turned
by
another
band
advancing
from
the
opposite
quarter
they
then
made
towards
the
spot
where
their
broomsticks
were
deposited
but
ere
they
could
reach
it
a
third
party
gained
the
summit
of
the
hill
at
this
precise
point
and
immediately
started
in
pursuit
of
them
meanwhile
a
young
man
issuing
from
behind
the
beacon
flew
towards
mistress
nutter
and
her
daughter
the
moment
the
flame
burst
forth
the
spell
cast
over
them
by
mother
demdike
was
broken
and
motion
and
speech
restored
alizon
exclaimed
the
young
man
as
he
came
up
your
trials
are
over
you
are
safe
oh
richard
she
replied
falling
into
his
arms
have
we
been
preserved
by
you
i
am
a
mere
instrument
in
the
hands
of
heaven
he
replied
mother
demdike
made
no
attempt
at
flight
with
the
rest
of
the
witches
but
remained
for
a
few
moments
absorbed
in
contemplation
of
the
flaming
beacon
her
hand
still
grasped
the
murderous
weapon
she
had
raised
against
alizon
but
it
had
dropped
to
her
side
when
the
fire
burst
forth
at
length
she
turned
fiercely
to
richard
and
demanded
was
it
thou
who
kindled
the
beacon
it
was
replied
the
young
man
and
who
bade
thee
do
it
who
brought
thee
hither
pursued
the
witch
an
enemy
of
thine
old
woman
replied
richard
his
vengeance
has
been
slow
in
coming
but
it
has
arrived
at
last
but
who
is
he
i
see
him
not
rejoined
mother
demdike
you
will
see
him
before
yon
flame
expires
said
richard
i
should
have
come
to
your
assistance
sooner
alizon
he
continued
turning
to
her
but
i
was
forbidden
and
i
knew
i
should
best
ensure
your
safety
by
compliance
with
the
injunctions
i
had
received
some
guardian
spirit
must
have
interposed
to
preserve
us
replied
alizon
for
such
only
could
have
successfully
combated
with
the
evil
beings
from
whom
we
have
been
delivered
thy
spirit
is
unable
to
preserve
thee
now
cried
mother
demdike
aiming
a
deadly
blow
at
her
with
the
knife
but
fortunately
the
attempt
was
foreseen
by
richard
who
caught
her
arm
and
wrested
the
weapon
from
her
curses
on
thee
richard
assheton
cried
the
infuriated
hag
and
on
thee
too
alizon
device
i
can
not
work
ye
the
immediate
ill
i
wish
i
can
not
make
ye
loathsome
in
one
another
eyes
i
can
not
maim
your
limbs
or
blight
your
beauty
i
can
not
deliver
you
over
to
devilish
possession
but
i
can
bequeath
you
a
legacy
of
hate
what
i
say
will
come
to
pass
thou
alizon
wilt
never
wed
richard
assheton
never
vainly
shall
ye
struggle
with
your
destiny
vainly
indulge
hopes
of
happiness
misery
and
despair
and
an
early
grave
are
in
store
for
both
of
you
he
shall
be
to
you
your
worst
enemy
and
you
shall
be
to
him
destruction
think
of
the
witch
prediction
and
tremble
and
may
her
deadliest
curse
rest
upon
your
heads
oh
richard
exclaimed
alizon
who
would
have
sunk
to
the
ground
if
he
had
not
sustained
her
why
did
you
not
prevent
this
terrible
malediction
he
could
not
replied
mother
demdike
with
a
laugh
of
exultation
it
shall
work
and
thy
doom
shall
be
accomplished
and
now
to
make
an
end
of
old
chattox
and
then
they
may
take
me
where
they
please
and
she
was
approaching
her
old
enemy
with
the
intention
of
putting
her
threat
into
execution
when
james
device
who
appeared
to
start
from
the
ground
rushed
swiftly
towards
her
what
art
thou
doing
here
jem
cried
the
hag
regarding
him
with
angry
surprise
dost
thou
not
see
we
are
surrounded
by
enemies
i
can
not
escape
them
but
thou
art
young
and
active
away
with
thee
not
without
yo
granny
replied
jem
ey
ha
run
os
fast
os
ey
could
to
help
yo
stick
fast
howld
on
me
he
added
snatching
her
up
in
his
arms
an
bring
yo
clear
off
yet
and
he
set
off
at
a
rapid
pace
with
his
burthen
richard
being
too
much
occupied
with
alizon
to
oppose
him
chapter
how
the
beacon
fire
was
extinguished
soon
after
this
nicholas
assheton
attended
by
two
or
three
men
came
up
and
asked
whither
the
old
witch
had
flown
mistress
nutter
pointed
out
the
course
taken
by
the
fugitive
who
had
run
towards
the
northern
extremity
of
the
hill
down
the
sides
of
which
he
had
already
plunged
she
has
been
carried
off
by
her
grandson
jem
device
said
mistress
nutter
be
quick
or
you
will
lose
her
ay
be
quick
be
quick
added
mother
chattox
yonder
they
went
to
the
back
of
the
beacon
casting
a
look
at
the
wretched
speaker
and
finding
she
was
too
grievously
wounded
to
be
able
to
move
nicholas
bestowed
no
further
thought
upon
her
but
set
off
with
his
companions
in
the
direction
pointed
out
he
speedily
arrived
at
the
edge
of
the
hill
and
looking
down
it
sought
in
vain
for
any
appearance
of
the
fugitives
the
sides
were
here
steep
and
shelving
and
some
hundred
yards
lower
down
were
broken
into
ridges
behind
one
of
which
it
was
possible
the
old
witch
and
her
grandson
might
be
concealed
so
without
a
moment
hesitation
the
squire
descended
and
began
to
search
about
in
the
hollows
scrambling
over
the
loose
stones
or
sliding
down
for
some
paces
with
the
uncertain
boggy
soil
when
he
fancied
he
heard
a
plaintive
cry
he
looked
around
but
could
see
no
one
the
whole
side
of
the
mountain
was
lighted
up
by
the
fire
from
the
beacon
which
instead
of
diminishing
burnt
with
increased
ardour
so
that
every
object
was
as
easily
to
be
discerned
as
in
the
but
notwithstanding
this
he
could
not
detect
whence
the
sound
proceeded
it
was
repeated
but
more
faintly
than
before
and
nicholas
almost
persuaded
himself
it
was
the
voice
of
potts
calling
for
help
motioning
to
his
followers
who
were
engaged
in
the
search
like
himself
to
keep
still
the
squire
listened
intently
and
again
caught
the
sound
being
this
time
convinced
it
arose
from
the
ground
was
it
possible
the
unfortunate
attorney
had
been
buried
alive
or
had
he
been
thrust
into
some
hole
and
a
stone
placed
over
it
which
he
found
it
impossible
to
remove
the
latter
idea
seemed
the
more
probable
and
nicholas
was
guided
by
a
feeble
repetition
of
the
noise
towards
a
large
fragment
of
rock
which
on
examination
had
evidently
been
rolled
from
a
point
immediately
over
the
mouth
of
a
hollow
the
squire
instantly
set
himself
to
work
to
dislodge
the
ponderous
stone
and
aided
by
two
of
his
men
who
lent
their
broad
shoulders
to
the
task
quickly
accomplished
his
object
disclosing
what
appeared
to
be
the
mouth
of
a
cavernous
recess
from
out
of
this
as
soon
as
the
stone
was
removed
popped
the
head
of
master
potts
and
nicholas
bidding
him
be
of
good
cheer
laid
hold
of
him
to
draw
him
forth
as
he
seemed
to
have
some
difficulty
in
extricating
himself
when
the
attorney
cried
out
do
not
pull
so
hard
squire
that
accursed
jem
device
has
got
hold
of
my
legs
not
so
hard
sir
i
entreat
bid
him
let
go
said
nicholas
unable
to
refrain
from
laughing
or
we
will
unearth
him
from
his
badger
hole
he
pays
no
heed
to
what
i
say
to
him
cried
potts
oh
dear
oh
dear
he
is
dragging
me
down
again
and
as
he
spoke
the
attorney
notwithstanding
all
nicholas
efforts
to
restrain
him
was
pulled
down
into
the
hole
the
squire
was
at
a
loss
what
to
do
and
was
considering
whether
he
should
resort
to
the
tedious
process
of
digging
him
out
when
a
scrambling
noise
was
heard
and
the
captive
head
once
more
appeared
above
ground
are
you
coming
out
now
asked
nicholas
alas
no
replied
the
attorney
unless
you
will
make
terms
with
the
rascal
he
declares
he
will
strangle
me
if
you
do
not
promise
to
set
him
and
his
grandmother
free
is
mother
demdike
with
him
asked
nicholas
to
be
sure
replied
potts
and
we
are
as
badly
off
for
room
as
three
foxes
in
a
hole
and
there
is
no
other
outlet
said
the
squire
i
conclude
not
replied
the
attorney
i
groped
about
like
a
mole
when
i
was
first
thrust
into
the
cavern
by
jem
device
but
i
could
find
no
means
of
exit
the
entrance
was
blocked
up
by
the
great
stone
which
you
had
some
difficulty
in
moving
but
which
jem
could
shift
at
will
for
he
pushed
it
aside
in
a
moment
and
brought
it
back
to
its
place
when
he
returned
just
now
with
the
old
hag
but
probably
that
was
effected
by
witchcraft
most
likely
said
nicholas
but
for
your
being
in
it
we
would
stop
up
this
hole
and
bury
the
two
wretches
alive
get
me
out
first
good
master
nicholas
i
implore
of
you
and
then
do
what
you
please
cried
potts
jem
is
tugging
at
my
legs
as
if
he
would
pull
them
off
we
will
try
who
is
strongest
said
nicholas
again
seizing
hold
of
potts
by
the
shoulders
oh
dear
oh
dear
i
ca
bear
it
let
go
shrieked
the
attorney
i
shall
be
stretched
to
twice
my
natural
length
my
joints
are
starting
from
their
sockets
my
legs
are
coming
off
oh
oh
lend
a
hand
here
one
of
you
cried
nicholas
to
the
men
we
have
him
out
whatever
be
the
consequence
but
i
wo
come
roared
potts
you
have
no
right
to
use
me
thus
torture
oh
oh
my
loins
are
ruptured
my
back
is
breaking
i
am
a
dead
the
hag
has
got
hold
of
my
right
leg
while
jem
is
tugging
with
all
his
force
at
the
left
pull
away
cried
nicholas
he
is
coming
my
legs
are
off
yelled
potts
as
he
was
plucked
suddenly
forth
with
a
jerk
that
threw
the
squire
and
his
assistants
on
their
backs
i
shall
never
be
able
to
walk
more
no
heaven
be
praised
he
added
looking
down
on
his
lower
limbs
i
have
only
lost
my
boots
never
mind
it
then
cried
nicholas
but
thank
your
stars
you
are
above
ground
once
more
jem
he
continued
shouting
down
the
hole
if
you
do
come
forth
at
once
and
bring
mother
demdike
with
you
we
close
up
the
mouth
of
this
hole
in
such
a
way
that
you
require
another
grave
d
hear
yeigh
replied
jem
his
voice
coming
hoarsely
and
hollowly
up
like
the
accents
of
a
ghost
am
ey
to
go
free
if
ey
comply
certainly
not
replied
the
squire
you
have
a
choice
between
this
hole
and
the
hangman
cord
at
lancaster
that
is
all
in
either
case
you
will
die
by
suffocation
but
be
quick
we
have
wasted
time
enough
already
with
you
then
if
that
aw
yo
do

me
squire
eyn

wheere

rejoined
jem
very
well
replied
nicholas
here
my
man
stop
up
this
hole
with
earth
and
stones
master
potts
you
will
lend
a
hand
to
the
task
readily
sir
replied
the
attorney
though
i
shall
lose
the
pleasure
i
had
anticipated
of
seeing
that
old
carrion
crow
roasted
alive
stay
a
bit
squoire
roared
jem
as
preparations
were
actively
made
for
carrying
nicholas
orders
into
execution
stay
a
bit
an
cum
owt
an
bring
t
owd
woman
wi
me
i
thought
you
change
your
mind
replied
nicholas
laughing
be
upon
your
guard
he
added
in
a
low
tone
to
the
others
and
seize
him
the
moment
he
appears
but
jem
evidently
found
it
no
easy
matter
to
perform
his
promise
for
stifled
shrieks
and
other
noises
proclaimed
that
a
desperate
struggle
was
going
on
between
him
and
his
grandmother
aha
exclaimed
nicholas
placing
his
ear
to
the
hole
the
old
hag
is
unwilling
to
come
forth
and
spits
and
scratches
like
a
while
jem
gripes
her
like
a
terrier
it
is
a
hard
tussle
between
them
but
he
is
getting
the
better
of
it
and
is
pushing
her
forth
now
look
out
and
as
he
spoke
mother
demdike
terrible
head
protruded
from
the
ground
and
despite
of
the
execrations
she
poured
forth
upon
her
enemies
she
was
instantly
seized
by
them
drawn
out
of
the
cavern
and
secured
while
the
men
were
thus
engaged
and
while
nicholas
attention
was
for
an
instant
diverted
jem
bounded
forth
as
suddenly
as
a
wolf
from
his
lair
and
dashing
aside
all
opposition
plunged
down
the
hill
it
is
useless
to
pursue
him
said
nicholas
he
will
not
escape
the
whole
country
will
be
roused
by
the
beacon
fire
and
hue
and
cry
shall
be
made
after
him
right
exclaimed
potts
and
now
let
some
one
creep
into
that
cavern
and
bring
out
my
boots
and
then
i
shall
be
in
a
better
condition
to
attend
you
the
request
being
complied
with
and
the
attorney
being
once
more
equipped
for
walking
the
party
climbed
the
and
bringing
mother
demdike
with
them
shaped
their
course
towards
the
beacon
and
now
to
see
what
had
taken
place
in
the
interim
scarcely
had
the
squire
quitted
mistress
nutter
than
sir
ralph
assheton
rode
up
to
her
why
do
you
loiter
here
madam
he
said
in
a
stern
tone
somewhat
tempered
by
sorrow
i
have
held
back
to
give
you
an
opportunity
of
escape
the
hill
is
invested
by
your
enemies
on
that
side
roger
nowell
is
advancing
and
on
this
sir
thomas
metcalfe
and
his
followers
you
may
possibly
effect
a
retreat
in
the
opposite
direction
but
not
a
moment
must
be
lost
i
will
go
with
you
said
alizon
no
no
interposed
richard
you
have
not
strength
for
the
effort
and
will
only
retard
her
i
thank
you
for
your
devotion
my
child
said
mistress
nutter
with
a
look
of
grateful
tenderness
but
it
is
unneeded
i
have
no
intention
of
flying
i
shall
surrender
myself
into
the
hands
of
justice
do
not
mistake
the
matter
madam
said
sir
ralph
and
delude
yourself
with
the
notion
that
either
your
rank
or
wealth
will
screen
you
from
punishment
your
guilt
is
too
clearly
established
to
allow
you
a
chance
of
escape
and
though
i
myself
am
acting
wrongfully
in
counselling
flight
to
you
i
am
led
to
do
so
from
the
friendship
once
subsisting
between
us
and
the
relationship
which
unfortunately
i
can
not
destroy
it
is
you
who
are
mistaken
not
i
sir
ralph
replied
mistress
nutter
i
have
no
thought
of
turning
aside
the
sword
of
justice
but
shall
court
its
sharpest
edge
hoping
by
a
full
avowal
of
my
offences
in
some
degree
to
atone
for
them
my
only
regret
is
that
i
shall
leave
my
child
unprotected
and
that
my
fate
will
bring
dishonour
upon
her
oh
think
not
of
me
dear
mother
cried
alizon
but
persist
unhesitatingly
in
the
course
you
have
laid
down
far
rather
would
i
see
you
act
thus
far
rather
hear
the
sentiments
you
have
uttered
even
though
they
may
be
attended
by
the
saddest
consequences
than
behold
you
in
your
former
proud
position
and
impenitent
think
not
of
me
then
or
rather
think
only
how
i
rejoice
that
your
eyes
are
at
length
opened
and
that
you
have
cast
off
the
bonds
of
iniquity
i
can
now
pray
for
you
with
the
full
hope
that
my
intercessions
will
prevail
and
in
parting
with
you
in
this
world
shall
be
sustained
by
the
conviction
that
we
shall
meet
in
eternal
happiness
hereafter
mistress
nutter
threw
her
arms
about
her
daughter
neck
and
they
mingled
their
tears
together
sir
ralph
assheton
was
much
moved
it
is
a
pity
she
should
fall
into
their
hands
he
observed
to
richard
i
know
not
how
to
advise
replied
the
latter
greatly
troubled
ah
it
is
too
late
exclaimed
the
knight
here
come
nowell
and
metcalfe
the
poor
lady
firmness
will
be
severely
tested
the
next
moment
the
magistrate
and
the
knight
came
up
with
such
of
their
attendants
as
were
not
engaged
in
pursuing
the
witches
several
of
whom
had
already
been
captured
on
seeing
mistress
nutter
sir
thomas
metcalfe
sprang
from
his
horse
and
would
have
seized
her
but
sir
ralph
interposed
saying
she
has
surrendered
herself
to
me
i
will
be
answerable
for
her
safe
custody
your
pardon
sir
ralph
observed
nowell
the
arrest
must
be
formally
made
and
by
a
constable
sparshot
execute
your
warrant
upon
this
the
official
leaping
from
his
horse
displayed
his
staff
and
a
piece
of
parchment
to
mistress
nutter
telling
her
she
was
his
prisoner
the
lady
bowed
her
head
shan
ey
tee
her

demanded
the
constable
of
the
magistrate
on
no
account
fellow
interposed
sir
ralph
i
will
have
no
indignity
offered
her
i
have
already
said
i
will
be
responsible
for
her
you
will
recollect
she
is
arrested
for
witchcraft
sir
ralph
observed
nowell
she
shall
answer
to
the
charges
brought
against
her
i
pledge
myself
to
that
replied
sir
ralph
and
by
a
full
confession
said
mistress
nutter
you
may
pledge
yourself
to
that
also
sir
ralph
she
avows
her
guilt
cried
nowell
i
take
you
all
to
witness
it
i
shall
not
forget
it
said
sir
thomas
metcalfe
nor
i
nor
i
cried
sparshot
and
two
or
three
others
of
the
attendants
this
girl
is
my
prisoner
said
sir
thomas
metcalfe
dismounting
and
advancing
towards
alizon
she
is
a
witch
as
well
as
the
rest
it
is
false
cried
richard
and
if
you
attempt
to
lay
hands
upon
her
i
will
strike
you
to
the
earth
exclaimed
metcalfe
drawing
his
sword
i
will
not
let
this
insolence
pass
unpunished
i
have
other
affronts
to
chastise
stand
aside
or
i
will
cut
your
throat
hold
sir
thomas
cried
sir
ralph
assheton
authoritatively
settle
your
quarrels
hereafter
if
you
have
any
to
adjust
but
i
will
have
no
fighting
now
alizon
is
no
witch
you
are
well
aware
that
she
was
about
to
be
impiously
and
cruelly
sacrificed
by
mother
demdike
and
her
rescue
was
the
main
object
of
our
coming
hither
still
suspicion
attaches
to
her
said
metcalfe
whether
she
be
the
daughter
of
elizabeth
device
or
alice
nutter
she
comes
of
a
bad
stock
and
i
protest
against
her
being
allowed
to
go
free
however
if
you
are
resolved
upon
it
i
have
nothing
more
to
say
i
shall
find
other
time
and
place
to
adjust
my
differences
with
master
richard
assheton
when
you
please
sir
replied
the
young
man
sternly
and
i
will
answer
for
the
propriety
of
the
course
i
have
pursued
said
sir
ralph
but
here
comes
nicholas
with
mother
demdike
demdike
taken
i
am
glad
of
it
cried
mother
chattox
slightly
raising
herself
as
she
spoke
kill
her
or
she
will
you
when
nicholas
came
up
with
the
old
hag
both
sir
ralph
assheton
and
roger
nowell
put
several
questions
to
her
but
she
refused
to
answer
their
interrogations
and
horrified
by
her
blasphemies
and
imprecations
they
caused
her
to
be
removed
to
a
short
distance
while
a
consultation
was
held
as
to
the
course
to
be
pursued
we
have
made
half
a
dozen
of
these
miscreants
prisoners
said
roger
nowell
and
the
whole
of
them
had
better
be
taken
to
whalley
where
they
can
be
safely
confined
in
the
old
dungeons
of
the
abbey
and
after
their
examination
on
the
morrow
can
be
removed
to
lancaster
castle
be
it
so
replied
sir
ralph
but
must
yon
unfortunate
lady
he
added
pointing
to
mistress
nutter
be
taken
with
them
assuredly
replied
nowell
we
can
make
no
distinction
among
such
offenders
or
if
there
are
any
degrees
in
guilt
hers
is
of
the
highest
class
you
had
better
take
leave
of
your
daughter
said
sir
ralph
to
mistress
nutter
i
thank
you
for
the
hint
replied
the
lady
farewell
dear
alizon
she
added
straining
her
to
her
bosom
we
must
part
for
some
time
once
more
before
i
quit
this
world
in
which
i
have
played
so
wicked
a
part
i
would
fain
look
upon
you
fain
bless
you
if
i
have
the
power
but
this
must
be
at
the
last
when
my
trials
are
wellnigh
over
and
when
all
is
about
to
close
upon
me
oh
must
it
be
thus
exclaimed
alizon
in
a
voice
half
suffocated
by
emotion
it
must
replied
her
mother
do
not
attempt
to
shake
my
resolution
my
sweet
child
do
not
weep
for
me
amidst
all
the
terrors
that
surround
me
i
am
happier
now
than
i
have
been
for
years
i
shall
strive
to
work
out
my
redemption
by
prayers
and
you
will
succeed
cried
alizon
not
so
shrieked
mother
demdike
the
fiend
will
have
his
own
she
is
bound
to
him
by
a
compact
which
nought
can
annul
i
should
like
to
see
the
instrument
said
potts
i
might
give
a
legal
opinion
upon
it
perhaps
it
might
be
avoided
and
in
any
case
its
production
in
court
would
have
an
admirable
effect
i
think
i
see
the
counsel
examining
it
and
hear
the
judges
calling
for
it
to
be
placed
before
them
his
infernal
majesty
signature
must
be
a
curiosity
in
its
way
our
gracious
and
sagacious
monarch
would
delight
in
it
peace
exclaimed
nicholas
and
take
care
he
cried
that
no
further
interruptions
are
offered
by
that
infernal
hag
have
you
done
madam
he
added
to
mistress
nutter
who
still
remained
with
her
daughter
folded
in
her
arms
not
yet
replied
the
lady
oh
what
happiness
i
have
thrown
away
what
anguish
what
remorse
brought
upon
myself
by
the
evil
life
i
have
led
as
i
gaze
on
this
fair
face
and
think
it
might
long
long
have
brightened
my
dark
and
desolate
life
with
its
sunshine
as
i
think
upon
all
this
my
fortitude
wellnigh
deserts
me
and
i
have
need
of
support
from
on
high
to
carry
me
through
my
trial
but
i
fear
it
will
be
denied
me
nicholas
assheton
you
have
the
deed
of
the
gift
of
rough
lee
in
your
possession
henceforth
alizon
is
mistress
of
the
mansion
and
domains
provided
always
they
are
not
forfeited
to
the
crown
which
i
apprehend
will
be
the
case
suggested
potts
i
will
take
care
she
is
put
in
possession
of
them
said
nicholas
as
to
you
richard
continued
mistress
nutter
the
time
may
come
when
your
devotion
to
my
daughter
may
be
rewarded
and
i
could
not
bestow
a
greater
boon
upon
you
than
by
giving
you
her
hand
it
may
be
well
i
should
give
my
consent
now
and
if
no
other
obstacle
should
arise
to
the
union
may
she
be
yours
and
happiness
i
am
sure
will
attend
you
overpowered
by
conflicting
emotions
alizon
hid
her
face
in
her
bosom
and
richard
who
was
almost
equally
overcome
was
about
to
reply
when
mother
demdike
broke
upon
them
they
will
never
be
united
she
screamed
never
i
have
said
it
and
my
words
will
come
true
thou
a
witch
like
thee
can
bless
an
union
alice
nutter
thy
blessings
are
curses
thy
wishes
disappointments
and
despair
thriftless
love
shall
be
alizon
and
the
grave
shall
be
her
bridal
bed
the
witch
daughter
shall
share
the
witch
fate
these
boding
words
produced
a
terrible
effect
upon
the
hearers
heed
her
not
my
sweet
child
she
speaks
falsely
said
mistress
nutter
endeavouring
to
her
daughter
but
the
tone
in
which
the
words
were
uttered
showed
that
she
herself
was
greatly
alarmed
i
have
cursed
them
both
and
i
will
curse
them
again
yelled
mother
demdike
away
with
the
old
cried
nicholas
take
her
to
the
beacon
and
if
she
continues
troublesome
hurl
her
into
the
flame
and
notwithstanding
the
hag
struggles
and
imprecations
she
was
removed
whatever
may
betide
alizon
cried
richard
my
life
shall
be
devoted
to
you
and
if
you
should
not
be
mine
i
will
have
no
other
bride
with
your
permission
madam
he
added
to
mistress
nutter
i
will
take
your
daughter
to
middleton
where
she
will
find
companionship
and
solace
i
trust
in
the
attentions
of
my
sister
who
has
the
strongest
affection
for
her
i
could
wish
nothing
better
replied
the
lady
and
now
to
put
an
end
to
this
harrowing
scene
farewell
my
child
take
her
richard
take
her
she
cried
as
she
disengaged
herself
from
the
relaxing
embrace
of
her
daughter
now
master
nowell
i
am
ready
it
is
well
madam
he
replied
you
will
join
the
other
prisoners
and
we
will
set
forth
but
at
this
juncture
a
terrific
shriek
was
heard
which
drew
all
eyes
towards
the
beacon
when
mother
demdike
had
been
removed
in
accordance
with
the
directions
her
conduct
became
more
violent
and
outrageous
than
ever
and
those
who
had
charge
of
her
threatened
if
she
did
not
desist
to
carry
out
the
full
instructions
they
had
received
and
cast
her
into
the
flames
the
old
hag
defied
and
incensed
them
to
such
a
degree
by
her
violence
and
blasphemies
that
they
carried
her
to
the
very
edge
of
the
fire
at
this
moment
the
figure
of
a
monk
in
mouldering
white
habiliments
came
from
behind
the
beacon
and
stood
beside
the
old
hag
he
slowly
raised
his
hood
and
disclosed
features
that
looked
like
those
of
the
dead
thy
hour
is
come
accursed
woman
cried
the
phantom
in
thrilling
accents
thy
term
on
earth
is
ended
and
thou
shalt
be
delivered
to
unquenchable
fire
the
curse
of
paslew
is
fulfilled
upon
thee
and
will
be
fulfilled
upon
all
thy
viperous
brood
art
thou
the
abbot
shade
demanded
the
hag
i
am
thy
implacable
enemy
replied
the
phantom
thy
judgment
and
thy
punishment
are
committed
to
me
to
the
flames
with
her
such
was
the
awe
inspired
by
the
monk
and
such
the
authority
of
his
tones
and
gesture
that
the
command
was
unhesitatingly
obeyed
and
the
witch
was
cast
shrieking
into
the
fire
she
was
instantly
swallowed
up
as
in
a
gulf
of
flame
which
raged
and
roared
and
shot
up
in
a
hundred
lambent
points
as
if
exulting
in
its
prey
the
wretched
creature
was
seen
for
a
moment
to
rise
up
in
it
in
extremity
of
anguish
with
arms
extended
and
uttering
a
dreadful
yell
but
the
flames
wreathed
round
her
and
she
sank
for
ever
when
those
who
had
assisted
at
this
fearful
execution
looked
around
for
the
mysterious
being
who
had
commanded
it
they
could
nowhere
behold
him
then
was
heard
a
laugh
of
gratified
hate
such
a
laugh
as
only
a
demon
or
one
bound
to
a
demon
can
utter
and
the
appalled
listeners
looked
around
and
beheld
mother
chattox
standing
behind
them
my
rival
is
gone
cried
the
hag
i
have
seen
the
last
of
her
she
is
burnt
ah
ah
further
triumph
was
not
allowed
her
with
one
accord
and
as
if
prompted
by
an
irresistible
impulse
the
men
rushed
upon
her
seized
her
and
cast
her
into
the
fire
her
wild
laughter
was
heard
for
a
moment
above
the
roaring
of
the
flames
and
then
ceased
altogether
again
the
flame
shot
high
in
air
again
roared
and
raged
again
broke
into
a
multitude
of
lambent
points
after
which
it
suddenly
expired
all
was
darkness
on
the
summit
of
pendle
hill
and
in
silence
and
in
gloom
scarcely
more
profound
than
that
weighing
in
every
breast
the
melancholy
troop
pursued
its
way
to
whalley
end
of
the
second
book
book
the
third
hoghton
tower
chapter
downham
on
a
lovely
morning
about
the
middle
of
july
in
the
same
year
as
the
events
previously
narrated
nicholas
assheton
always
astir
with
the
lark
issued
from
his
own
dwelling
and
sauntered
across
the
smooth
lawn
in
front
of
it
the
green
eminence
on
which
he
stood
was
sheltered
on
the
right
by
a
grove
of
sycamores
forming
the
boundary
of
the
park
and
sloped
down
into
a
valley
threaded
by
a
small
clear
stream
whose
murmuring
as
it
danced
over
its
pebbly
bed
distinctly
reached
his
ear
in
the
stillness
of
early
day
on
the
left
partly
in
the
valley
and
partly
on
the
side
of
the
acclivity
on
which
the
hall
was
situated
nestled
the
little
village
whose
inhabitants
owned
nicholas
as
lord
and
to
judge
from
their
habitations
they
had
reason
to
rejoice
in
their
master
for
certainly
there
was
a
cheerful
air
about
downham
which
the
neighbouring
hamlets
especially
those
in
pendle
forest
sadly
wanted
on
the
left
of
the
mansion
and
only
separated
from
it
by
the
garden
walls
stood
the
church
a
venerable
structure
dating
back
to
a
period
more
remote
even
than
whalley
abbey
from
the
churchyard
a
view
almost
similar
to
that
enjoyed
by
the
squire
was
obtained
though
partially
interrupted
by
the
thick
rounded
foliage
of
a
large
tree
growing
beneath
it
and
many
a
traveller
who
came
that
way
lingered
within
the
hallowed
precincts
to
contemplate
the
prospect
at
the
foot
of
the
hill
was
a
small
stone
bridge
crossing
the
stream
across
the
road
and
scarce
thirty
paces
from
the
stood
a
little
alehouse
whose
comfortable
fireside
nook
and
good
liquors
were
not
disdained
by
the
squire
in
fact
to
his
shame
be
it
spoken
he
was
quite
as
often
to
be
found
there
of
an
evening
as
at
the
hall
this
had
more
particularly
been
the
case
since
the
house
was
tenanted
by
richard
baldwyn
who
having
given
up
the
mill
at
rough
lee
and
taken
to
wife
bess
whitaker
of
goldshaw
booth
had
removed
with
her
to
downham
where
he
now
flourished
under
the
special
protection
of
the
squire
bess
had
lost
none
of
her
old
habits
of
command
and
it
must
be
confessed
that
poor
richard
played
a
very
secondary
part
in
the
establishment
nicholas
as
may
be
supposed
was
permitted
considerable
licence
by
her
but
even
he
had
limits
which
she
took
good
care
he
should
not
exceed
the
downham
domains
were
well
cultivated
the
line
of
demarcation
between
them
and
the
heathy
wastes
adjoining
being
clearly
traced
out
and
you
had
only
to
follow
the
course
of
the
brook
to
see
at
a
glance
where
the
purlieus
of
the
forest
ended
and
where
nicholas
property
commenced
the
one
being
a
dreary
moor
with
here
and
there
a
thicket
upon
it
but
more
frequently
a
dangerous
morass
covered
with
moss
and
the
other
consisting
of
green
meadows
bordered
in
most
instances
by
magnificent
timber
the
contrast
however
was
not
without
its
charm
and
while
the
sterile
wastes
set
off
the
fair
and
fertile
fields
around
them
and
enhanced
their
beauty
they
offered
a
wide
uninterrupted
expanse
over
which
the
eye
could
range
at
will
on
the
further
side
of
the
valley
and
immediately
opposite
the
lawn
whereon
nicholas
stood
the
ground
gradually
arose
until
it
reached
the
foot
of
pendle
hill
which
here
assuming
its
most
majestic
aspect
constituted
the
grand
and
peculiar
feature
of
the
scene
nowhere
could
the
lordly
eminence
be
seen
to
the
same
advantage
as
from
this
point
and
nicholas
contemplated
it
with
feelings
of
rapture
which
no
familiarity
could
diminish
the
sun
shone
brightly
upon
its
rounded
summit
and
upon
its
seamy
sides
revealing
all
its
rifts
and
ridges
adding
depth
of
tint
to
its
dusky
soil
laid
bare
in
places
by
the
winter
torrents
lending
new
beauty
to
its
purple
heath
and
making
its
grey
sod
glow
as
with
fire
so
exhilarating
was
the
prospect
that
nicholas
felt
half
tempted
to
cross
the
valley
and
scale
the
hill
before
breaking
his
fast
but
other
feelings
checked
him
and
he
turned
towards
the
right
here
beyond
a
paddock
and
some
outbuildings
lay
the
park
small
in
extent
but
beautifully
diversified
well
stocked
with
deer
and
boasting
much
noble
timber
in
the
midst
was
an
exquisite
knoll
which
besides
commanding
a
fine
view
of
pendle
hill
downham
and
all
the
adjacent
country
brought
within
its
scope
on
the
one
hand
the
ancient
castle
of
clithero
and
the
heights
overlooking
whalley
and
on
the
other
the
lovely
and
extensive
vale
through
which
the
ribble
wandered
this
also
was
a
favourite
point
of
view
with
the
squire
and
he
had
some
idea
of
walking
towards
it
when
he
was
arrested
by
a
person
who
came
from
the
house
and
who
shouted
to
him
hoarsely
but
blithely
to
stay
the
was
a
man
of
middle
age
with
a
skin
almost
as
tawny
as
a
gipsy
a
hooked
nose
black
beetling
brows
and
eyes
so
strangely
set
in
his
head
that
they
communicated
a
sinister
expression
to
his
countenance
he
possessed
a
burly
frame
square
and
somewhat
heavy
though
not
so
much
so
as
to
impede
his
activity
in
deportment
and
stature
though
not
in
feature
he
resembled
the
squire
himself
and
the
likeness
was
heightened
by
his
habiliments
being
part
of
nicholas
old
wardrobe
the
doublet
and
hose
and
even
the
green
hat
and
boots
being
those
in
which
nicholas
made
his
first
appearance
in
this
history
the
personage
who
thus
condescended
to
be
fed
and
clothed
at
the
expense
and
who
filled
a
situation
something
between
guest
and
menial
without
receiving
the
precise
attention
of
the
one
or
the
wages
of
the
other
but
who
made
himself
so
useful
to
nicholas
that
he
could
not
dispense
with
him
neither
perhaps
would
he
have
been
shaken
off
even
if
it
had
been
desired
was
named
lawrence
fogg
an
entire
stranger
to
the
country
whom
nicholas
had
picked
up
at
colne
and
whom
he
had
invited
to
downham
for
a
few
weeks
hunting
and
had
never
been
able
to
get
rid
of
him
since
lawrence
fogg
liked
his
quarters
immensely
and
determined
to
remain
in
them
and
as
a
means
to
so
desirable
an
end
he
studied
all
the
weak
points
and
peculiarities
and
these
not
being
very
difficult
to
be
understood
he
soon
mastered
them
and
mastered
the
squire
into
the
bargain
but
without
allowing
his
success
to
become
manifest
nicholas
was
delighted
to
find
one
with
tastes
so
congenial
to
his
own
who
was
so
willing
to
hunt
or
fish
with
him
who
could

the
enter
a
hound
better
than
charlie
crouch
the
old
huntsman
shoot
with
the
further
than
any
one
except
himself
and
was
willing
to
toss
off
a
pot
with
him
or
sing
a
merry
stave
whenever
he
felt
inclined
such
a
companion
was
invaluable
and
nicholas
congratulated
himself
upon
the
discovery
especially
when
he
found
lawrence
fogg
not
unwilling
to
undertake
some
delicate
commissions
for
him
which
he
could
not
well
execute
himself
and
which
he
was
unwilling
should
reach
mistress
assheton
ears
these
were
managed
with
equal
adroitness
and
caution
about
the
same
time
too
nicholas
finding
money
scarce
and
not
liking
to
borrow
it
in
person
delegated
fogg
and
sent
him
round
to
his
friends
to
ask
for
a
loan
but
in
this
instance
the
mission
was
attended
with
very
indifferent
success
for
not
one
of
them
would
lend
him
so
small
a
sum
as
thirty
pounds
all
averring
they
stood
in
need
of
it
quite
as
much
as
himself
though
somewhat
inconvenienced
by
their
refusal
nicholas
bore
the
disappointment
with
his
customary
equanimity
and
made
merry
with
his
friend
as
if
nothing
had
happened
fogg
showed
an
equal
accommodating
spirit
in
all
religious
observances
and
though
much
against
his
inclination
attended
morning
discourses
and
lectures
with
his
patron
and
even
made
an
attempt
at
but
on
one
occasion
missing
the
tune
and
coming
in
with
a
bacchanalian
chorus
he
was
severely
rebuked
by
the
minister
and
enjoined
to
keep
silence
in
future
such
was
the
friendly
relation
subsisting
between
the
parties
when
they
met
together
on
the
lawn
on
the
morning
in
question
well
fogg
cried
nicholas
after
exchanging
salutations
with
his
friend
what
say
you
to
hunting
the
otter
in
the
ribble
after
breakfast
is
a
rare
day
for
the
sport
and
the
hounds
are
in
excellent
order
there
is
an
old
dam
and
her
litter
whom
we
must
kill
for
she
has
been
playing
the
very
devil
with
the
fish
for
a
space
of
more
than
two
miles
and
if
we
let
her
off
for
another
week
we
shall
have
neither
salmon
trout
nor
umber
as
all
will
have
passed
down
the
maws
of
her
voracious
brood
and
that
would
be
a
pity
in
good
sooth
squire
replied
fogg
for
there
are
no
fish
like
those
of
the
ribble
nothing
i
should
prefer
to
the
sport
you
promise
but
i
thought
you
had
other
business
for
me
another
attempt
to
borrow
money
eh
ay
from
my
cousin
dick
assheton
rejoined
nicholas
he
will
lend
me
the
thirty
pounds
i
am
quite
sure
but
you
had
better
defer
the
visit
till
when
his
father
sir
richard
will
be
at
whalley
and
when
you
can
have
him
to
yourself
dick
will
not
say
you
nay
depend
o
he
is
too
good
a
fellow
for
that
a
murrain
on
those
curmudgeons
roger
nowell
nicholas
townley
and
tom
whitaker
they
ought
to
be
delighted
to
oblige
me
but
they
declare
they
have
no
money
said
fogg
no
money
pshaw
exclaimed
nicholas
an
idle
excuse
they
have
chests
full
would
i
had
all
roger
nowell
gold
i
should
not
require
another
supply
for
years
but
i
will
not
trouble
myself
for
a
paltry
thirty
pounds
if
i
might
venture
to
suggest
squire
while
you
are
about
it
i
would
ask
for
a
hundred
pounds
or
even
two
or
three
hundred
said
fogg
your
friends
will
think
all
the
better
of
you
and
feel
more
satisfied
you
intend
to
repay
them
do
you
think
so
cried
nicholas
then
by
plutus
it
shall
be
three
hundred
pounds
three
hundred
at
interest
dick
will
have
to
borrow
the
amount
to
lend
it
to
me
but
no
matter
he
will
easily
obtain
it
harkye
fogg
while
you
are
at
middleton
endeavour
to
ascertain
whether
any
thing
has
been
arranged
about
the
marriage
of
a
certain
young
lady
to
a
certain
young
gentleman
i
am
curious
to
know
the
precise
state
of
affairs
in
that
quarter
i
will
arrive
at
the
truth
if
possible
squire
replied
fogg
but
i
should
scarcely
think
sir
richard
would
assent
to
his
son
union
with
the
daughter
of
a
notorious
witch
sir
richard
son
is
scarcely
likely
to
ask
sir
richard
consent
said
nicholas
and
as
to
mistress
nutter
though
heavy
charges
have
been
brought
against
her
nothing
has
been
proved
for
you
know
she
escaped
or
rather
was
rescued
on
her
way
to
lancaster
castle
i
am
fully
aware
of
it
squire
replied
fogg
and
i
more
than
suspect
a
worthy
friend
of
mine
had
a
hand
in
her
deliverance
and
could
tell
where
to
find
her
if
needful
but
that
is
neither
here
nor
there
the
lady
is
quite
innocent
i
dare
say
indeed
i
am
quite
sure
of
it
since
you
espouse
her
cause
so
warmly
but
the
world
is
malicious
and
strange
things
are
reported
of
her
heed
not
the
world
fogg
rejoined
nicholas
the
world
speaks
well
of
no
man
be
his
deserts
what
they
may
the
world
says
that
i
waste
my
estate
in
wine
women
and
horseflesh
that
i
spend
time
in
pleasures
which
might
be
profitably
employed
that
i
neglect
my
wife
forget
my
religious
observances
am
on
horseback
when
i
should
be
afoot
at
the
alehouse
when
i
should
be
at
home
at
a
marriage
when
i
should
be
at
a
funeral
shooting
when
i
should
be
keeping
my
books
in
short
it
has
not
a
good
word
to
say
for
me
and
as
for
thee
fogg
it
says
thou
art
an
idle
fellow
or
if
thou
art
good
for
aught
it
is
only
for
something
that
leads
to
evil
it
says
thou
drinkest
prodigiously
liest
confoundedly
and
swearest
most
profanely
that
thou
art
ever
more
ready
to
go
to
the
alehouse
than
to
church
and
that
none
of
the
girls
can
thee
nay
the
slanderers
even
go
so
far
as
to
assert
thou
wouldst
not
hesitate
to
say
and
deliver
to
a
true
man
on
the
highway
that
is
what
the
world
says
of
thee
but
hang
it
never
look
chapfallen
man
let
us
go
to
the
stables
and
then
we
will
in
to
breakfast
after
which
we
will
proceed
to
the
ribble
and
spear
the
old
otter
a
fine
old
manorial
residence
was
downham
and
beautifully
situated
as
has
been
shown
on
a
woody
eminence
to
the
north
of
pendle
hill
it
was
of
great
antiquity
and
first
came
into
the
possession
of
the
assheton
family
in
considerable
additions
had
been
made
to
it
by
its
present
owner
nicholas
and
the
outlay
necessarily
required
combined
with
his
lavish
expenditure
had
contributed
to
embarrass
him
the
stables
were
large
and
full
of
horses
the
kennels
on
the
same
scale
and
equally
well
supplied
with
hounds
and
there
was
a
princely
retinue
of
servants
in
the
yard
grooms
keepers
falconers
huntsmen
and
their
assistants
to
say
nothing
of
their
fellows
within
doors
in
short
if
it
had
been
your
fortune
to
accompany
the
squire
and
his
friend
round
the
premises
if
you
had
walked
through
the
stables
and
counted
the
horses
if
you
had
viewed
the
kennels
and
examined
the
various
hounds
the
great
lancashire
dogs
tall
shaggy
and
heavy
a
race
now
extinct
the
worcestershire
hounds
then
also
in
much
repute
the
greyhounds
the
harriers
the
beagles
the
lurchers
and
lastly
the
verminers
or
as
we
should
call
them
the
terriers
if
you
had
seen
all
these
you
would
not
have
wondered
that
money
was
scarce
with
him
still
further
would
your
surprise
at
such
a
consequence
have
diminished
if
you
had
gone
on
to
the
falconry
and
seen
on
the
perches
the
goshawk
and
her
tercel
the
sparrowhawk
and
her
musket
under
the
care
of
the
ostringer
and
further
on
the
the
gerfalcon
the
lanner
the
merlin
and
the
hobby
all
of
which
were
attended
to
by
the
head
falconer
it
would
have
done
you
good
to
hear
nicholas
inquiring
from
his
men
if
they
had
set
out
their
birds
that
morning
and
weathered
them
if
they
had
mummy
powder
in
readiness
then
esteemed
a
sovereign
remedy
if
the
lures
hoods
jesses
buets
and
all
other
needful
furniture
were
in
good
order
and
if
the
meat
were
sweet
and
wholesome
you
might
next
have
followed
him
to
the
pens
where
the
fighting
cocks
were
kept
and
where
you
would
have
found
another
source
of
expense
in
the
tom
shaw
a
knave
who
not
only
got
high
wages
from
his
master
but
understood
so
well
the
dieting
of
his
birds
that
he
could
make
them
win
or
lose
a
battle
as
he
thought
proper
here
again
nicholas
had
much
to
say
and
was
in
raptures
with
one
cock
which
he
told
fogg
he
would
back
to
any
amount
utterly
unconscious
of
a
significant
look
that
passed
between
his
friend
and
the
look
at
him
cried
the
squire
how
proud
and
erect
he
stands
his
head
is
as
small
as
that
of
a
sparrowhawk
his
eye
large
and
quick
his
body
thick
his
leg
strong
in
the
beam
and
his
spurs
long
rough
and
sharp
that
is
the
bird
for
me
i
will
take
him
over
to
the
cockpit
at
prescot
next
week
and
match
him
against
any
bird
sir
john
talbot
or
my
cousin
braddyll
can
bring
and
win
squoire
replied
the
ey
ha
been
him
these
five
weeks
so
he
be
i
rare
condition
then
and
winna
fail
yo
yo
may
lay
what
yo
loike
upon
him
he
added
with
a
sly
wink
at
fogg
you
may
win
the
thirty
pounds
you
want
observed
the
latter
in
a
low
tone
to
the
squire
or
mayhap
lose
it
replied
nicholas
i
shall
not
risk
so
much
unless
i
get
the
three
hundred
from
dick
assheton
i
have
been
unlucky
of
late
you
beat
me
constantly
at
tables
now
fogg
and
when
i
first
knew
you
this
was
not
wont
to
be
the
case
nay
never
make
any
excuses
man
you
can
not
help
it
let
us
in
to
breakfast
with
this
he
proceeded
towards
the
house
followed
by
fogg
and
a
couple
of
large
lancashire
hounds
and
entering
at
the
back
of
the
premises
made
his
way
through
the
scullery
into
the
kitchen
here
there
were
plentiful
evidences
of
the
hospitality
not
to
say
profusion
reigning
throughout
the
mansion
an
open
door
showed
a
larder
stocked
with
all
kinds
of
provisions
and
before
the
fire
joints
of
meat
and
poultry
were
roasting
pies
were
baking
in
the
oven
and
over
the
flames
in
the
chimney
was
suspended
a
black
pot
large
enough
for
a
witch
caldron
the
cook
was
busied
in
preparing
for
the
gridiron
some
trout
intended
for
the
squire
own
breakfast
and
a
was
toasting
oatcakes
of
which
there
was
a
large
supply
in
the
depending
from
the
ceiling
casting
a
look
around
and
exchanging
a
few
words
with
the
cook
nicholas
moved
on
still
followed
by
fogg
and
the
hounds
and
tracking
a
long
stone
passage
entered
the
great
hall
here
the
same
disorder
and
irregularity
prevailed
as
in
his
own
character
and
conduct
all
was
litter
and
confusion
around
the
walls
were
hung
breastplates
and
morions
shields
and
swords
but
they
were
half
hidden
by
dogs
collars
saddles
and
bridles
housings
quivers
baldricks
horns
spears
guns
and
every
other
implement
then
used
in
the
sports
of
the
river
or
the
field
the
floor
was
in
an
equal
state
of
disorder
the
rushes
were
filled
with
bones
brought
thither
by
the
hounds
and
in
one
corner
on
a
mat
was
a
favourite
spaniel
and
her
whelps
the
squire
however
was
happily
insensible
to
the
condition
of
the
chamber
and
looked
around
it
with
an
air
of
satisfaction
as
if
he
thought
it
the
perfection
of
comfort
a
table
was
spread
for
breakfast
near
a
window
looking
out
upon
the
lawn
and
two
covers
only
were
laid
for
mistress
nicholas
assheton
did
not
make
her
appearance
at
this
early
hour
and
now
was
exhibited
one
of
those
strange
contradictions
of
which
the
squire
character
was
composed
kneeling
down
by
the
side
of
the
table
and
without
noticing
the
mocking
expression
of
fogg
countenance
as
he
followed
his
example
nicholas
prayed
loudly
and
fervently
for
upwards
of
ten
minutes
after
which
he
arose
and
gave
a
shout
which
proved
that
his
lungs
were
unimpaired
and
not
only
roused
the
whole
house
but
set
all
the
dogs
barking
presently
a
couple
of
answered
this
lusty
summons
and
the
table
was
covered
with
good
and
substantial
dishes
which
he
and
his
companion
attacked
with
a
vigour
such
as
only
the
most
valiant
trencherman
can
display
already
has
it
been
remarked
that
a
breakfast
at
the
period
in
question
resembled
a
modern
dinner
and
better
proof
could
not
have
been
afforded
of
the
correctness
of
the
description
than
the
meal
under
discussion
which
comprised
fish
flesh
and
fowl
boiled
broiled
and
roast
together
with
strong
ale
and
sack
after
an
hour
thus
agreeably
employed
and
while
they
were
still
seated
though
breakfast
had
pretty
nearly
come
to
an
end
a
entered
announcing
master
richard
sherborne
of
dunnow
the
squire
instantly
sprang
to
his
feet
and
hastened
to
welcome
his
ah
to
you
dick
he
cried
shaking
him
heartily
by
the
hand

happy
chance

you
here
so
early
but
first

down
and
eat
eat

of

sherborne
last
night
a

from

nicholas
indignantly

me
for
cousin
dick
for
a
right
good
fellow
who
i
am
sure
will
comply
with
his
request
especially
when
he
finds
there

no
sort
of
degradation
in
it
replied
sherborne
why
i

several
others
of
our
friends
there

nicholas
as

with
a
sudden
thought

thomas
hoghton
would
lend
me
that
sum
if
i
consent
to
wear
his
cloth

replied
sherborne
and

nicholas
and

as
you
can
and
then
i
will
take
you
to

and

otter
sherborne
was
not
long
in
concluding
his
repast
and
having
received
an
otter
spear
from
the
squire
who
had
already
provided
himself
and
fogg
with
like
weapons
all
three
adjourned
to
the
kennels
where
they
found
the
old
huntsman
charlie
crouch
awaiting
them
attended
by
four
stout
varlets
armed
with
forked
staves
meant
for
the
double
purpose
of
beating
the
river
banks
and
striking
the
poor
beast
they
were
about
to
hunt
and
each
man
having
a
couple
of
hounds
well
entered
for
the
chase
in
leash
old
crouch
was
a
thin
fellow
but
possessed
of
a
tough
muscular
frame
which
served
him
quite
as
well
in
the
long
run
as
the
younger
and
apparently
more
vigorous
limbs
of
his
assistants
his
cheek
was
hale
and
his
eye
still
bright
and
quick
and
a
certain
fierceness
was
imparted
to
his
countenance
by
a
large
aquiline
nose
he
was
attired
in
a
greasy
leathern
jerkin
tight
hose
of
the
same
material
and
had
a
bugle
suspended
from
his
neck
and
a
sharp
thrust
into
his
girdle
in
his
hand
he
bore
a
spear
like
his
master
and
was
followed
by
a
grey
old
lurcher
who
though
wanting
an
ear
and
an
eye
and
disfigured
by
sundry
scars
on
throat
and
back
was
hardy
untiring
and
sagacious
this
ancient
dog
was
called
grip
from
his
tenacity
in
holding
any
thing
he
set
his
teeth
upon
and
he
and
crouch
were
inseparable
great
was
the
clamour
occasioned
by
the
squire
appearance
in
the
yard
the
coupled
hounds
gave
tongue
at
once
and
sang
out
most
melodiously
and
all
the
other
dogs
within
the
kennels
or
roaming
at
will
about
the
yard
joined
the
concert
after
much
swearing
cracking
of
whips
and
yelping
consequent
upon
the
cracking
silence
was
in
some
degree
restored
and
a
consultation
was
then
held
between
nicholas
and
crouch
as
to
where
their
steps
should
first
be
bent
the
old
huntsman
was
for
drawing
the
river
near
a
place
called
bean
hill
wood
as
the
trees
thereabouts
growing
close
to
the
water
edge
it
was
pretty
certain
the
otter
would
have
her
couch
amid
the
roots
of
some
of
them
this
was
objected
to
by
one
of
the
varlets
who
declared
that
the
beast
lodged
in
a
hollow
tree
standing
on
a
bank
nearly
a
mile
higher
up
the
stream
and
close
by
the
point
of
junction
between
swanside
beck
and
the
ribble
he
was
certain
of
the
fact
he
avouched
because
he
had
noticed
her
marks
on
the
moist
grass
near
the
tree

a
brave
dog
but
confoundedly
ugly
exclaimed
the
squire
regarding
the
old
lurcher
with
mingled
admiration
and
disgust
and
now
that
all
is
arranged
let
us
be
off
accordingly
they
quitted
the
and
shaping
their
course
in
the
direction
indicated
by
the
huntsman
entered
the
park
and
proceeded
along
a
glade
checkered
by
the
early
sunbeams
here
the
noise
they
made
in
their
progress
speedily
disturbed
a
herd
of
deer
browsing
beneath
the
trees
and
as
the
dappled
foresters
darted
off
to
a
thicker
covert
great
difficulty
was
experienced
by
the
varlets
in
restraining
the
hounds
who
struggled
eagerly
to
follow
them
and
made
the
welkin
resound
with
their
baying
yonder
is
a
tall
fellow
cried
nicholas
pointing
out
a
noble
buck
to
crouch
i
must
kill
him
next
week
for
i
want
to
send
a
haunch
of
venison
to
middleton
and
another
to
whalley
abbey
for
sir
ralph
better
hunt
him
squoire
said
crouch
he
will
gi
ye
good
sport
soon
after
this
they
attained
an
eminence
where
a
charming
sweep
of
country
opened
upon
them
including
the
finest
part
of
ribblesdale
with
its
plains
and
the
swift
and
beautiful
river
from
which
it
derived
its
name
the
view
was
enchanting
and
the
squire
and
his
companions
paused
for
a
moment
to
contemplate
it
and
then
stepping
gleefully
forward
made
their
way
over
the
elastic
turf
towards
a
small
thicket
skirting
the
park
all
were
in
high
spirits
for
the
freshness
and
beauty
of
the
morning
had
not
been
without
effect
and
the
tongue
kept
pace
with
his
legs
as
he
strode
briskly
along
but
as
they
entered
the
thicket
in
question
and
caught
sight
of
the
river
through
the
trees
the
old
huntsman
enjoined
silence
and
he
was
obliged
to
put
a
check
upon
his
loquacity
when
within
a
bowshot
from
the
water
the
party
came
to
a
halt
and
two
of
the
men
were
directed
by
crouch
to
cross
the
stream
at
different
points
and
then
commence
beating
the
banks
while
the
other
two
were
ordered
to
pursue
a
like
course
but
to
keep
on
the
near
side
of
the
river
the
hounds
were
next
uncoupled
and
the
men
set
off
to
execute
the
orders
they
had
received
and
soon
afterwards
the
crashing
of
branches
and
the
splashing
of
water
accompanied
by
the
deep
baying
of
the
hounds
told
they
were
at
work
meanwhile
nicholas
and
the
others
had
not
remained
idle
as
the
varlets
struck
off
in
different
directions
they
went
straight
on
and
forcing
their
way
through
the
brushwood
came
to
a
high
bank
overlooking
the
ribble
on
the
top
of
which
grew
three
or
four
large
trees
whose
roots
laid
bare
on
the
further
side
by
the
swollen
currents
of
winter
formed
a
convenient
for
the
creature
they
hoped
to
surprise
receiving
a
hint
from
crouch
to
make
for
the
central
tree
nicholas
grasped
his
spear
and
sprang
forward
but
quick
as
he
was
he
was
too
late
though
he
saw
enough
to
convince
him
that
the
crafty
old
huntsman
had
been
correct
in
his
judgment
for
a
dark
slimy
object
dropped
from
out
the
roots
of
the
tree
beneath
him
and
glided
into
the
water
as
swiftly
and
as
noiselessly
as
if
its
skin
had
been
oiled
a
few
bubbles
rose
to
the
surface
of
the
water
but
these
were
all
the
indications
marking
the
course
of
the
wondrous
diver
but
other
eyes
sharper
than
those
of
nicholas
were
on
the
watch
and
the
old
huntsman
shouted
out
there
hoo
goes
grip
efter
her
lad
efter
her
the
words
were
scarcely
uttered
when
the
dog
sprang
from
the
top
of
the
bank
and
sank
under
the
water
for
some
seconds
no
trace
could
be
observed
of
either
animal
and
then
the
shaggy
nose
of
the
lurcher
was
seen
nearly
fifty
yards
higher
up
the
river
and
after
sniffing
around
for
a
moment
and
fixing
his
single
eye
on
his
master
who
was
standing
on
the
bank
and
encouraging
him
with
his
voice
and
gesture
he
dived
again
station
yourselves
on
the
bank
fifty
paces
apart
cried
crouch
run
run
or
be
too
late
an
strike
os
quick
os
leet
if
yo
a
chance
stay
wheere
you
are
squoire
he
added
to
nicholas
yo
canna
be
better
placed
all
was
now
animation
and
excitement
perceiving
from
the
noise
that
the
otter
had
been
found
the
four
varlets
hastened
towards
the
scene
of
action
and
by
their
shouts
and
the
clatter
of
their
staves
contributed
greatly
to
its
spirit
two
were
on
one
side
of
the
stream
and
two
on
the
other
and
up
to
this
moment
the
hounds
were
similarly
separated
but
now
most
of
them
had
taken
to
the
water
some
swimming
about
others
standing
up
to
the
middle
in
the
shallower
part
of
the
current
watching
with
keen
gaze
for
the
appearance
of
their
anticipated
victim
having
descended
the
bank
nicholas
had
so
placed
himself
among
the
huge
twisted
roots
of
the
tree
that
if
the
otter
alarmed
by
the
presence
of
so
many
foes
and
unable
to
escape
either
up
or
down
the
river
should
return
to
her
couch
he
made
certain
of
striking
her
at
first
there
seemed
little
chance
of
such
an
occurrence
for
fogg
who
had
gone
a
hundred
yards
higher
up
suddenly
dashed
into
the
stream
and
plunging
his
spear
into
the
mud
cried
out
that
he
had
hit
the
beast
but
the
next
moment
when
he
drew
the
weapon
forth
and
exhibited
a
large
rat
which
he
had
transfixed
his
mistake
excited
much
merriment
old
crouch
meantime
did
not
suffer
his
attention
to
be
drawn
from
his
dog
every
now
and
then
he
saw
him
come
to
the
surface
to
breathe
but
as
he
kept
within
a
short
distance
though
rising
at
different
points
the
old
huntsman
felt
certain
the
otter
had
not
got
away
and
having
the
utmost
reliance
upon
grip
perseverance
and
sagacity
he
felt
confident
he
would
bring
the
quarry
to
him
if
the
thing
were
possible
the
varlets
kept
up
an
incessant
clatter
beating
the
water
with
their
staves
and
casting
large
stones
into
it
while
the
hounds
bayed
furiously
so
that
the
poor
fugitive
was
turned
on
whichever
side
she
attempted
a
retreat
while
this
was
going
on
nicholas
was
cautioned
by
the
huntsman
to
look
out
and
scarcely
had
the
admonition
reached
him
than
the
sleek
shining
body
of
the
otter
emerged
from
the
water
and
wreathed
itself
among
the
roots
the
squire
instantly
dealt
a
blow
which
he
expected
to
prove
fatal
but
his
mortification
was
excessive
when
he
found
he
had
driven
the
so
deeply
into
the
tree
that
he
could
scarcely
disengage
it
while
an
almost
noiseless
plunge
told
that
his
prey
had
escaped
almost
at
the
same
moment
that
the
poor
hunted
beast
had
sought
its
old
lodging
the
untiring
lurcher
had
appeared
at
the
edge
of
the
bank
and
as
the
former
again
went
down
he
dived
likewise
secretly
laughing
at
the
squire
failure
the
old
huntsman
prepared
to
take
advantage
of
a
similar
opportunity
if
it
should
present
itself
and
with
this
view
ensconced
himself
behind
a
pollard
willow
which
stood
close
beside
the
stream
and
whence
he
could
watch
closely
all
that
passed
without
being
exposed
to
view
the
prudence
of
the
step
was
soon
manifest
after
the
lapse
of
a
few
seconds
during
which
neither
dog
nor
otter
had
risen
to
breathe
a
slight
very
slight
undulation
was
perceptible
on
the
surface
of
the
water
crouch
grasp
tightened
upon
his
staff
he
waited
another
moment
then
dashed
forward
struck
down
his
spear
and
raised
it
aloft
with
the
poor
otter
transfixed
and
writhing
upon
its
point
loudly
and
exultingly
did
the
old
man
shout
at
his
triumph
and
loudly
were
his
vociferations
answered
by
the
others
all
flew
to
the
spot
where
he
was
standing
and
the
hounds
gathering
round
him
yelled
furiously
at
the
otter
and
showed
every
disposition
to
tear
her
in
pieces
if
they
could
get
at
her
kicking
the
noisiest
and
fiercest
of
them
out
of
the
way
crouch
approached
the
river
brink
and
lowered
the
till
it
came
within
reach
of
his
favourite
grip
who
had
not
yet
come
out
of
the
water
but
stood
within
his
depth
with
his
one
red
eye
fixed
on
the
enemy
he
had
so
hotly
pursued
and
fully
expecting
his
reward
it
now
came
his
sharp
teeth
instantly
met
in
the
throat
and
when
crouch
swung
them
both
in
the
air
he
still
maintained
his
hold
showing
how
well
he
deserved
his
name
nor
could
he
be
disengaged
until
long
after
the
sufferings
of
the
tortured
animal
had
ceased
to
say
that
nicholas
was
neither
chagrined
at
his
ill
success
nor
jealous
of
the
old
huntsman
superior
skill
would
be
to
affirm
an
untruth
but
he
put
the
best
face
he
could
upon
the
matter
and
praised
grip
very
highly
alleging
that
the
whole
merit
of
the
hunt
rested
with
him
old
crouch
let
him
go
on
and
when
he
had
done
quietly
observed
that
the
otter
they
had
destroyed
was
not
the
one
they
came
in
search
of
as
they
had
seen
nothing
of
her
litter
and
that
most
likely
the
beast
that
had
done
so
much
mischief
had
her
lodging
in
the
hollow
tree
near
the
swanside
beck
as
described
by
the
varlet
and
he
wished
to
know
whether
the
squire
would
like
to
go
and
hunt
her
nicholas
replied
that
he
was
quite
willing
to
do
so
and
hoped
he
should
have
better
luck
on
the
second
occasion
and
with
this
they
set
forward
again
taking
their
way
along
the
side
of
the
stream
beating
the
banks
as
they
went
but
without
rousing
any
thing
beyond
an
occasional
which
was
killed
almost
as
soon
as
found
by
grip
somehow
or
other
without
any
one
being
aware
what
led
to
it
the
conversation
fell
upon
the
two
old
witches
mothers
demdike
and
chattox
and
the
strange
manner
in
which
their
career
had
terminated
on
the
summit
of
pendle
hill
if
indeed
it
could
be
said
to
have
terminated
when
their
spirits
were
reported
to
haunt
the
spot
and
might
be
seen
it
was
asserted
at
midnight
flitting
round
the
beacon
and
shrieking
dismally
the
restless
shades
were
pursued
it
was
added
by
the
figure
of
a
monk
in
white
mouldering
robes
supposed
to
be
the
ghost
of
paslew
it
was
difficult
to
understand
how
these
apparitions
could
be
witnessed
since
no
one
even
for
a
reward
could
be
prevailed
upon
to
ascend
pendle
hill
after
nightfall
but
the
shepherds
affirmed
they
had
seen
them
from
below
and
that
was
testimony
sufficient
to
shake
the
most
sceptical
one
singular
circumstance
was
mentioned
which
must
not
be
passed
by
without
notice
and
this
was
that
when
the
cinders
of
the
extinct
came
to
be
examined
no
remains
whatever
of
the
two
hags
could
be
discovered
though
the
ashes
were
carefully
sifted
and
it
was
quite
certain
that
the
flames
had
expired
long
before
their
bodies
could
be
consumed
the
explanation
attempted
for
this
marvel
was
that
satan
had
carried
them
off
while
yet
living
to
finish
their
combustion
in
a
still
more
fiery
region
mention
of
mother
demdike
naturally
led
to
her
grandson
jem
device
who
having
escaped
in
a
remarkable
manner
on
the
night
in
question
notwithstanding
the
hue
and
cry
made
after
him
had
not
as
yet
been
captured
though
he
had
been
occasionally
seen
at
night
and
under
peculiar
circumstances
by
various
individuals
and
amongst
others
by
old
crouch
who
however
declared
he
had
been
unable
to
lay
hands
upon
him
allusion
was
then
made
to
mistress
nutter
whereupon
it
was
observed
that
the
squire
changed
the
conversation
quickly
while
sundry
sly
winks
and
shrugs
were
exchanged
among
the
varlets
of
the
kennel
seeming
to
intimate
that
they
knew
more
about
the
matter
than
they
cared
to
admit
nothing
more
however
was
elicited
than
that
the
escort
conducting
her
to
lancaster
castle
together
with
the
other
witches
after
their
examination
before
the
magistrates
at
whalley
and
committal
had
been
attacked
while
it
was
passing
through
a
woody
defile
in
bowland
forest
by
a
party
of
men
in
the
garb
of
foresters
and
the
lady
set
free
nor
had
she
been
heard
of
since
what
made
this
rescue
the
more
extraordinary
was
that
none
of
the
other
witches
were
liberated
at
the
same
time
but
some
of
them
who
seemed
disposed
to
take
advantage
of
the
favourable
interposition
and
endeavoured
to
get
away
were
brought
back
by
the
foresters
to
the
officers
of
justice
thus
clearly
proving
that
the
attempt
was
solely
made
on
mistress
nutter
account
and
must
have
been
undertaken
by
her
friends
nothing
it
was
asserted
could
equal
the
rage
and
mortification
of
roger
nowell
and
potts
on
learning
that
their
chief
prey
had
thus
escaped
them
and
by
their
directions
for
more
than
a
week
the
strictest
search
was
made
for
the
fugitive
throughout
the
neighbourhood
but
without
effect
no
clue
could
be
discovered
to
her
retreat
suspicion
naturally
fell
upon
the
two
asshetons
nicholas
and
richard
and
roger
nowell
roundly
taxed
them
with
contriving
and
executing
the
enterprise
in
person
while
potts
told
them
they
were
guilty
of
misprision
of
felony
and
threatened
them
with
imprisonment
for
life
forfeiture
of
goods
and
of
rents
for
the
offence
but
as
the
charge
could
not
be
proved
against
them
notwithstanding
all
the
efforts
of
the
magistrate
and
attorney
it
fell
to
the
ground
and
master
potts
full
of
chagrin
at
this
unexpected
and
vexatious
termination
of
the
affair
returned
to
london
and
settled
himself
in
his
chambers
in
chancery
lane
his
duties
however
as
clerk
of
the
court
would
necessarily
call
him
to
lancaster
in
august
when
the
assizes
commenced
and
when
he
would
assist
at
the
trials
of
such
of
the
witches
as
were
still
in
durance
from
mother
demdike
it
was
natural
that
the
conversation
should
turn
to
her
weird
retreat
malkin
tower
and
richard
sherborne
expressed
his
surprise
that
the
unhallowed
structure
should
be
suffered
to
remain
standing
after
her
removal
nicholas
said
he
was
equally
anxious
with
his
for
its
demolition
but
it
was
not
so
easily
to
be
accomplished
as
it
might
appear
for
the
deserted
structure
was
in
such
ill
repute
with
the
common
folk
as
well
as
every
one
else
that
no
one
dared
approach
it
even
in
the
daytime
a
boggart
it
was
said
had
taken
possession
of
its
vaults
and
scared
away
all
who
ventured
near
it
sometimes
showing
himself
in
one
frightful
shape
and
sometimes
in
another
now
as
a
monstrous
goat
now
as
an
equally
monstrous
cat
uttering
fearful
cries
glaring
with
fiery
eyes
from
out
of
the
windows
or
appearing
in
all
his
terror
on
the
summit
of
the
tower
moreover
the
haunted
structure
was
frequently
lighted
up
at
dead
of
night
strains
of
unearthly
music
were
heard
resounding
from
it
and
wild
figures
were
seen
flitting
past
the
windows
as
if
engaged
in
dancing
and
revelry
so
that
it
appeared
that
no
alteration
for
the
better
had
taken
place
there
and
that
things
were
still
quite
as
improperly
conducted
now
as
they
had
been
in
the
time
of
mother
demdike
or
in
those
of
her
predecessors
isole
de
heton
and
blackburn
the
robber
the
common
opinion
was
that
satan
and
all
his
imps
had
taken
up
their
abode
in
the
tower
and
as
they
liked
their
quarters
led
a
jolly
life
there
dancing
and
drinking
all
night
long
it
would
be
useless
at
present
to
give
them
notice
to
quit
still
less
to
attempt
to
pull
down
the
house
about
their
ears
richard
sherborne
heard
this
wondrous
relation
in
silence
but
with
a
look
of
incredulity
and
when
it
was
done
he
winked
slily
at
his
a
strange
expression
half
comical
half
suspicious
might
also
have
been
observed
on
fogg
countenance
and
he
narrowly
watched
the
squire
as
the
latter
spoke
but
with
the
disappearance
of
the
malignant
old
hags
who
had
so
long
infested
the
neighbourhood
had
all
mischief
and
calamity
ceased
or
were
people
as
much
afflicted
as
heretofore
were
there
in
short
so
many
cases
of
witchcraft
real
or
supposed
this
was
the
question
next
addressed
by
sherborne
to
nicholas
the
squire
answered
decidedly
there
were
not
since
the
burning
of
the
two
old
beldames
and
the
imprisonment
of
the
others
the
whole
district
of
pendle
had
improved
all
those
who
had
been
smitten
with
strange
illnesses
had
recovered
and
the
inhabitants
of
the
little
village
of
sabden
who
had
experienced
the
fullest
effects
of
their
malignity
were
entirely
free
from
sickness
and
not
only
had
they
and
their
families
suddenly
regained
health
and
strength
but
all
belonging
to
them
had
undergone
a
similar
beneficial
change
the
kine
that
had
lost
their
milk
now
yielded
it
abundantly
the
lame
horse
halted
no
longer
the
murrain
ceased
among
the
sheep
the
pigs
that
had
grown
lean
amidst
abundance
fattened
rapidly
and
though
the
farrows
that
had
perished
during
the
evil
ascendency
of
the
witches
could
not
be
brought
back
again
their
place
promised
speedily
to
be
supplied
by
others
the
corn
blighted
early
in
the
year
had
sprung
forth
anew
and
the
trees
nipped
in
the
bud
were
laden
with
fruit
in
short
all
was
as
fair
and
as
flourishing
as
it
had
recently
been
the
reverse
amongst
others
john
law
the
pedlar
who
had
been
deprived
of
the
use
of
his
limbs
by
the
damnable
arts
of
mother
demdike
had
marvellously
recovered
on
the
very
night
of
her
destruction
and
was
now
as
strong
and
as
active
as
ever
such
happy
results
having
followed
the
removal
of
the
witches
it
was
to
be
hoped
sherborne
said
that
the
riddance
would
be
complete
and
that
none
of
the
obnoxious
brood
would
be
left
to
inflict
future
miseries
on
their
fellows
this
could
not
be
the
case
so
long
as
james
device
was
allowed
to
go
at
large
nor
while
his
mother
elizabeth
device
a
notorious
witch
was
suffered
to
escape
with
impunity
there
was
also
jennet
elizabeth
daughter
a
mischievous
and
little
creature
who
inherited
all
the
ill
qualities
of
her
parents
these
were
the
spawn
of
the
old
snake
and
until
they
were
entirely
exterminated
there
could
be
no
security
against
a
recurrence
of
the
evil
again
there
was
nance
redferne
old
a
comely
woman
enough
but
a
reputed
witch
and
an
undoubted
fabricator
of
clay
images
she
was
still
at
liberty
though
she
ought
to
be
with
the
rest
in
the
dungeons
of
lancaster
castle
it
was
useless
to
allege
that
with
the
destruction
of
the
old
hags
all
danger
had
ceased
common
prudence
would
keep
the
others
quiet
now
but
the
moment
the
storm
passed
over
they
would
resume
their
atrocious
practices
and
all
would
be
as
bad
as
ever
no
no
the
tree
must
be
utterly
uprooted
or
it
would
inevitably
burst
forth
anew
with
these
opinions
nicholas
generally
concurred
but
he
expressed
some
sympathy
for
nance
redferne
whom
he
thought
far
too
to
be
as
wicked
and
malicious
as
represented
but
however
that
might
be
and
however
much
he
might
desire
to
get
rid
of
the
family
of
the
devices
he
feared
such
a
step
might
be
attended
with
danger
to
alizon
and
that
she
might
in
some
way
or
other
be
implicated
with
them
this
last
remark
he
addressed
in
an
to
his
sherborne
did
not
at
first
feel
any
apprehension
on
that
score
but
on
reflection
he
admitted
that
nicholas
was
perhaps
right
and
though
alizon
was
now
the
recognised
daughter
of
mistress
nutter
yet
her
long
and
intimate
connection
with
the
device
family
might
operate
to
her
prejudice
while
her
near
relationship
to
an
avowed
witch
would
not
tend
to
remove
the
unfavourable
impression
sherborne
then
went
on
to
speak
in
the
most
rapturous
terms
of
the
beauty
and
goodness
of
the
young
girl
who
formed
the
subject
of
their
conversation
and
declared
he
was
not
in
the
least
surprised
that
richard
assheton
was
so
much
in
love
with
her
and
yet
he
added
a
most
extraordinary
change
had
taken
place
in
her
since
the
dreadful
night
on
pendle
hill
when
her
mother
guilt
had
been
proclaimed
and
when
her
arrest
had
taken
place
as
an
offender
of
the
darkest
dye
alizon
he
said
had
lost
none
of
her
beauty
but
her
light
and
joyous
expression
of
countenance
had
been
supplanted
by
a
look
of
profound
sadness
which
nothing
could
remove
gentle
and
meek
in
her
deportment
she
seemed
to
look
upon
herself
as
under
a
ban
and
as
if
she
were
unfit
to
associate
with
the
rest
of
the
world
in
vain
richard
assheton
and
his
sister
endeavoured
to
remove
this
impression
by
the
tenderest
assiduities
in
vain
they
sought
to
induce
her
to
enter
into
amusements
consistent
with
her
years
she
declined
all
society
but
their
own
and
passed
the
greater
part
of
her
time
in
prayer
sherborne
had
seen
her
so
engaged
and
the
expression
of
her
countenance
he
declared
was
seraphic
on
the
extreme
verge
of
a
high
bank
situated
at
the
point
of
junction
between
swanside
beck
and
the
ribble
stood
an
old
decayed
oak
little
of
the
once
mighty
tree
beyond
the
gnarled
trunk
was
left
and
this
was
completely
hollow
while
there
was
a
great
rift
near
the
bottom
through
which
a
man
might
easily
creep
and
when
once
in
stand
erect
without
inconvenience
beneath
the
bank
the
river
was
deep
and
still
forming
a
pool
where
the
largest
and
fattest
fish
were
to
be
met
with
in
addition
to
this
the
spot
was
extremely
secluded
being
rarely
visited
by
the
angler
on
account
of
the
thick
copse
by
which
it
was
surrounded
and
which
extended
along
the
back
from
the
point
of
confluence
between
the
lesser
and
the
larger
stream
to
downham
mill
nearly
half
a
mile
distant
the
sides
of
the
ribble
were
here
as
elsewhere
beautifully
wooded
and
as
the
clear
stream
winded
along
through
banks
of
every
diversity
of
shape
and
character
and
covered
by
forest
trees
of
every
description
and
of
the
most
luxuriant
growth
the
effect
was
enchanting
the
more
so
that
the
sun
having
now
risen
high
in
the
heavens
poured
down
a
flood
of
summer
heat
and
radiance
that
rendered
these
cool
shades
inexpressibly
delightful
pleasant
was
it
as
the
huntsmen
leaped
from
stone
to
stone
to
listen
to
the
sound
of
the
waters
rushing
past
them
pleasant
as
they
sprang
upon
some
green
holm
or
fairy
islet
standing
in
the
midst
of
the
stream
and
dividing
its
lucid
waters
to
suffer
the
eye
to
follow
the
course
of
the
rapid
current
and
to
see
it
here
sparkling
in
the
bright
sunshine
there
plunged
in
shade
by
the
overhanging
trees
now
fringed
with
osiers
and
rushes
now
embanked
with
smoothest
sward
of
emerald
green
anon
defended
by
steep
rocks
sometimes
bold
and
bare
but
more
frequently
clothed
with
timber
then
sinking
down
by
one
of
those
sudden
but
exquisite
transitions
which
nature
alone
dares
display
from
this
savage
and
sombre
character
into
the
softest
and
gentlest
expression
every
where
varied
yet
every
where
beautiful
through
such
scenes
of
silvan
loveliness
had
the
huntsmen
passed
on
their
way
to
the
hollow
oak
and
they
had
ample
leisure
to
enjoy
them
because
the
squire
and
his
being
engaged
in
conversation
as
before
related
made
frequent
pauses
and
during
these
the
others
halted
likewise
and
even
the
hounds
glad
of
a
respite
stood
still
or
amused
themselves
by
splashing
about
amid
the
shallows
without
any
definite
object
unless
of
cooling
themselves
then
as
the
leaders
once
more
moved
forward
arose
the
cheering
shout
the
loud
deep
bay
the
clattering
of
staves
the
crashing
of
branches
and
all
the
other
inspiriting
noises
accompanying
the
progress
of
the
hunt
but
for
some
minutes
these
had
again
ceased
and
as
nicholas
and
sherborne
lingered
beneath
the
shade
of
a
growing
on
a
sandy
hillock
near
the
stream
and
seemed
deeply
interested
in
their
talk
as
well
they
might
for
it
related
to
alizon
the
whole
troop
including
fogg
held
respectfully
aloof
and
awaited
their
pleasure
to
go
on
the
signal
to
move
was
at
length
given
by
the
squire
who
saw
they
were
now
not
more
than
a
hundred
yards
from
the
bank
on
which
stood
the
hollow
tree
they
were
anxious
to
reach
as
the
river
here
made
a
turn
and
swept
round
the
point
in
question
forming
owing
to
this
detention
the
deep
pool
previously
mentioned
the
bank
almost
faced
them
and
as
nothing
intervened
they
could
almost
look
into
the
rift
near
the
base
of
the
tree
forming
they
supposed
the
entrance
to
the
otter
couch
but
though
this
was
easily
distinguished
no
traces
of
the
predatory
animal
could
be
seen
and
though
many
sharp
eyes
were
fixed
upon
the
spot
during
the
prolonged
discourse
of
the
two
gentlemen
nothing
had
occurred
to
attract
their
attention
and
to
prove
that
the
object
of
their
quest
was
really
there
after
some
little
consultation
between
the
squire
and
crouch
it
was
agreed
that
the
former
should
alone
force
his
way
to
the
tree
while
the
others
were
to
station
themselves
with
the
hounds
at
various
points
of
the
stream
above
and
below
the
bank
so
that
if
the
otter
and
her
litter
escaped
their
first
assailant
they
should
infallibly
perish
by
the
hands
of
some
of
the
others
this
being
agreed
upon
the
plan
was
instantly
put
into
execution
two
of
the
varlets
remaining
where
they
were
two
going
higher
up
while
sherborne
and
fogg
stationed
themselves
on
great
stones
in
the
middle
of
the
stream
whence
they
could
command
all
around
them
and
crouch
wading
on
with
grip
planted
himself
at
the
entrance
of
swanside
beck
into
the
ribble
meanwhile
the
squire
having
scaled
the
bank
entered
the
thick
covert
encircling
it
and
not
without
some
damage
to
his
face
and
hands
from
the
numerous
thorns
and
brambles
growing
amongst
it
forced
his
way
upwards
until
he
reached
the
bare
space
surrounding
the
hollow
tree
and
this
attained
his
first
business
was
to
ascertain
that
all
was
in
readiness
below
before
commencing
the
attack
a
glance
showed
him
on
one
side
old
crouch
standing
up
to
his
middle
in
the
beck
grasping
his
long
otter
spear
and
with
grip
beating
the
water
in
front
of
him
in
anxious
expectation
of
employment
and
in
front
fogg
sherborne
and
two
of
the
varlets
with
their
hounds
so
disposed
that
they
could
immediately
advance
upon
the
otter
if
it
plunged
into
the
river
while
its
passage
up
or
down
would
be
stopped
by
their
comrades
all
this
he
discerned
at
a
glance
and
comprehending
from
a
sign
made
him
by
the
old
huntsman
that
he
should
not
delay
he
advanced
towards
the
tree
and
was
about
to
plunge
his
spear
into
the
hole
hoping
to
transfix
one
at
least
of
its
occupants
when
he
was
startled
by
hearing
a
deep
voice
apparently
issue
from
the
hollows
of
the
timber
bidding
him
beware
nicholas
recoiled
aghast
for
he
thought
it
might
be
hobthurst
or
the
demon
of
the
wood
who
thus
bespoke
him
what
accursed
thing
addresses
me
he
said
standing
on
his
guard
what
is
it
speak
get
hence
nicholas
assheton
replied
the
voice
an
meddle
not
them
os
meddles
not
wi
thee
aha
exclaimed
the
squire
recovering
courage
for
he
thought
this
did
not
sound
like
the
language
of
a
demon
i
am
known
am
i
why
should
i
go
hence
and
at
whose
bidding

cried
nicholas
for
a
spirit
thou
usest
the
vernacular
of
the
county
fairly
enough
but
before
trying
whether
thy
hide
be
proof
against
mortal
weapons
i
command
thee
to
come

and

that

replied
the
boggart
gruffly
ah
methinks
i
should
know
those
accents
exclaimed
the
squire
they
marvellously
resemble
the
voice
of
an
offender
who
has
too
long
evaded
justice
and
whom
i
have
now
fairly
entrapped
jem
device
thou
art
known
lad
and
if
thou
dost
not
surrender
at
discretion
i
will
strike
my
spear
through
this
rotten
tree
and
spit
thee
as
i
would
the
beast
i
came
in
quest
of
an
which
yo
wad
more
easily
than
me
retorted
jem
and
suddenly
springing
from
the
hole
at
the
foot
of
the
tree
he
passed
between
the
squire
legs
with
great
promptitude
and
flinging
him
face
foremost
upon
the
ground
crawled
to
the
edge
of
the
bank
and
thence
dropped
into
the
deep
pool
below
the
plunge
roused
all
the
spectators
who
though
they
had
heard
what
had
passed
and
had
seen
the
squire
upset
in
the
manner
described
had
been
so
much
astounded
that
they
could
render
no
assistance
but
they
now
one
and
all
bestirred
themselves
actively
to
seize
the
diver
when
he
should
rise
to
the
surface
but
though
every
eye
was
on
the
and
every
arm
raised
though
the
hounds
were
as
eager
as
their
masters
and
yelling
fiercely
swam
round
the
pool
ready
to
pounce
upon
the
swimmer
as
upon
a
duck
all
were
disappointed
for
even
after
a
longer
interval
than
their
patience
could
brook
he
did
not
appear
by
this
time
nicholas
had
regained
his
legs
and
infuriated
by
his
discomfiture
approached
the
edge
of
the
bank
and
peering
down
below
hoped
to
detect
the
fugitive
immediately
beneath
him
resolved
to
show
him
no
mercy
when
he
caught
him
but
he
was
equally
at
fault
with
the
others
and
after
more
than
five
minutes
spent
in
ineffectual
search
he
ordered
crouch
to
send
grip
into
the
pool
the
old
keeper
replied
that
the
dog
was
not
used
to
this
kind
of
chase
and
might
not
display
his
usual
skill
in
it
but
as
the
squire
would
take
no
nay
he
was
obliged
to
consent
and
the
other
hounds
were
called
off
lest
they
should
puzzle
him
twice
did
the
shrewd
lurcher
swim
round
the
pool
sniffing
the
air
after
which
he
approached
the
shore
and
scented
close
to
the
bank
still
it
was
evident
he
could
detect
nothing
and
nicholas
began
to
despair
when
the
dog
suddenly
dived
expectation
was
then
raised
to
the
utmost
and
all
were
on
the
watch
again
nicholas
leaning
over
the
edge
of
the
bank
with
his
spear
in
hand
prepared
to
strike
but
the
dog
was
so
long
in
reappearing
that
all
had
given
him
up
for
lost
and
his
master
was
giving
utterance
to
ejaculations
of
grief
and
rage
and
vowing
vengeance
against
the
warlock
when
grip
grisly
head
was
once
more
seen
above
the
surface
of
the
water
and
this
time
he
had
a
piece
of
blue
serge
in
his
jaws
proving
that
he
had
had
hold
of
the
raiments
of
the
fugitive
and
that
therefore
the
latter
could
not
be
far
off
but
had
most
probably
got
into
some
hole
beneath
the
bank
no
sooner
was
this
notion
suggested
than
it
was
acted
on
by
the
old
huntsman
and
fogg
and
wading
forward
they
pricked
the
bank
with
their
spears
at
various
points
below
the
level
of
the
water
all
at
once
fogg
fell
forward
his
spear
had
entered
a
hole
and
had
penetrated
so
deeply
that
he
had
lost
his
balance
but
though
soused
over
head
and
ears
he
had
made
a
successful
hit
for
the
next
moment
jem
device
appeared
above
the
water
and
ere
he
could
dive
again
his
throat
was
seized
by
grip
and
while
struggling
to
free
himself
from
the
fangs
of
the
tenacious
animal
he
was
laid
hold
of
by
crouch
and
the
varlets
rushing
forward
to
the
latter
assistance
the
ruffian
was
captured
some
difficulty
was
experienced
in
rescuing
the
captive
from
the
jaws
of
the
hounds
who
infuriated
by
his
struggles
and
perhaps
mistaking
him
for
some
strange
beast
of
chase
made
their
sharp
teeth
meet
in
various
parts
of
his
person
rending
his
garments
from
his
limbs
and
would
no
doubt
have
rent
the
flesh
also
if
they
had
been
permitted
at
length
after
much
fighting
and
struggling
mingled
with
yells
and
vociferations
jem
was
borne
ashore
and
flung
on
the
ground
where
he
presented
a
wretched
spectacle
bleeding
and
covered
with
slime
acquired
during
his
occupation
of
the
hole
in
the
bank
but
though
unable
to
offer
further
resistance
his
spirit
was
not
quelled
and
his
eye
glared
terribly
at
his
captors
fearing
they
might
have
further
trouble
with
him
when
he
recovered
from
his
present
exhausted
condition
crouch
had
his
hands
bound
tightly
together
with
one
of
the
dog
leashes
and
then
would
fain
have
questioned
him
as
to
how
he
managed
to
breathe
in
a
hole
below
the
level
of
the
water
but
jem
refused
to
satisfy
his
curiosity
and
returned
only
a
sullen
rejoinder
to
any
questions
addressed
to
him
until
the
squire
who
had
crossed
the
river
at
some
lower
down
came
up
and
the
ruffian
then
inquired
in
a
tone
what
he
meant
to
do
with
him
what
do
i
mean
to
do
with
you
cried
nicholas
i

tell

replied
nicholas
but
thy
vindictive
purposes
will
be
frustrated
no
credence
will
be
attached
to
thy
false
charges
while

the

unavenged

him
not
interposed
sherborne
seeing
that
the
squire
was
shaken
by
his
threat
and
taking
him
apart
it
will
not
do
to
let
such
a
villain
escape
he
can
do
you
no
injury
and
as
to
mistress
nutter
if
you

it
will
be
easy
to
give

a
hint

nicholas

that

no

replied
nicholas
laughing
but
a
dog
death
is
too
good
for
him
and
besides
i
am
pretty
sure
his
destiny
is
not
drowning
no
no
at
all
risks
he
shall
go
to
whalley
harkee
fogg
he
added
beckoning
that
worthy
to
him
i
commit
the
conduct
and
custody
of
the
prisoner
to
you
clap
him
on
a
horse
get
on
another

take
these
four
varlets
with
you
and
deliver
him
into
the
hands
of
sir
ralph
assheton
who
will
relieve
you
of
all
further
trouble
and
responsibility
but
you
may
add
this
to
the
baronet
from
me
he
continued
in
an
i
recommend
him
to
place
under
immediate
arrest
elizabeth
device
the
prisoner
mother
and
her
daughter
jennet
you
understand
fogg
eh
perfectly
returned
the
other
with
a
somewhat
singular
look
and
your
instructions
shall
be
fulfilled
to
the
letter
have
you
any
thing
more
to
commit
to
me
only
this
said
nicholas
you
may
tell
sir
ralph
that
i
propose
to
sleep
at
the
abbey
i
shall
ride
over
to
middleton
in
the
course
of
the
day
to
confer
with
dick
assheton
upon
what
has
just
occurred
and
get
the
money
from
him
the
three
hundred
pounds
you
understand
and
when
my
errand
is
done
i
will
turn
bridle
towards
whalley
i
shall
return
by
todmorden
and
through
the
gorge
of
cliviger
you
may
as
well
tarry
for
me
at
the
abbey
for
sir
ralph
will
be
glad
of
thy
company
and
we
can
return
together
to
downham
as
the
squire
thus
spoke
he
noticed
a
singular
sparkle
in
eyes
but
he
thought
nothing
of
it
at
the
time
though
it
subsequently
occurred
to
his
recollection
meanwhile
the
prisoner
finding
no
grace
likely
to
be
shown
him
shouted
out
to
the
squire
that
if
he
were
set
free
he
would
make
certain
important
disclosures
to
him
respecting
fogg
who
was
not
what
he
represented
himself
but
nicholas
treated
the
offer
with
disdain
and
the
individual
mainly
interested
in
the
matter
who
appeared
highly
incensed
by
jem
malignity
cut
a
short
peg
by
way
of
gag
and
thrusting
it
into
the
ruffian
mouth
effectually
checked
any
more
revelations
on
his
part
fogg
then
ordered
the
varlets
to
bring
on
the
prisoner
but
as
jem
obstinately
refused
to
move
they
were
under
the
necessity
of
taking
him
on
their
shoulders
and
transporting
him
in
this
manner
to
the
stables
where
he
was
placed
on
a
horse
as
directed
by
the
squire
chapter
the
penitent
retreat
nicholas
and
sherborne
returned
by
a
different
road
from
that
taken
by
the
others
and
loitered
so
much
by
the
way
that
they
did
not
arrive
at
the
until
the
prisoner
and
his
escort
had
set
out
probably
this
was
designed
as
nicholas
seemed
relieved
when
he
learnt
they
were
gone
having
entered
the
house
with
his
and
conducted
him
to
an
apartment
opening
out
of
the
hall
usually
occupied
by
mistress
assheton
and
where
in
fact
they
found
that
amiable
lady
employed
at
her
embroidery
he
left
sherborne
with
her
and
making
some
excuse
for
his
own
hasty
retreat
betook
himself
to
another
part
of
the
house
mounting
the
principal
staircase
which
was
of
dark
oak
with
railing
he
turned
into
a
gallery
communicating
with
the
sleeping
apartments
and
after
proceeding
more
than
down
it
halted
before
a
door
which
he
unlocked
and
entered
a
spacious
but
evidently
disused
chamber
hung
round
with
faded
tapestry
and
containing
a
large
bedstead
securing
the
door
carefully
after
him
nicholas
raised
the
hangings
in
one
corner
of
the
room
and
pressing
against
a
spring
a
sliding
panel
flew
open
a
screen
was
placed
within
so
as
to
hide
from
view
the
inmate
of
the
secret
chamber
and
nicholas
having
coughed
slightly
to
announce
his
presence
and
received
an
answer
in
a
low
melancholy
female
voice
stepped
through
the
aperture
and
stood
within
a
small
closet
it
was
tenanted
by
a
lady
whose
features
and
figure
bore
the
strongest
marks
of
affliction
her
person
was
so
attenuated
that
she
looked
little
more
than
a
skeleton
her
fingers
were
long
and
thin
her
cheeks
hollow
and
deathly
pale
her
eyes
lustreless
and
deep
sunken
in
their
sockets
and
her
hair
once
jetty
as
the
raven
wing
prematurely
blanched
such
was
the
profound
gloom
stamped
upon
her
countenance
that
it
was
impossible
to
look
upon
her
without
compassion
while
in
spite
of
her
looks
there
was
a
noble
character
about
her
that
elevated
the
feeling
into
deep
interest
blended
with
respect
she
was
kneeling
beside
a
small
desk
with
an
open
bible
laid
upon
it
which
she
was
intently
studying
when
the
squire
appeared
here
is
a
terrible
text
for
you
nicholas
she
said
regarding
him
mournfully
listen
to
it
and
judge
of
its
effect
on
me
thus
it
is
written
in
deuteronomy
shall
not
be
found
among
you
any
one
that
maketh
his
son
or
his
daughter
to
pass
through
the
fire
or
that
useth
divination
or
an
observer
of
times
or
an
enchanter
or
a
witch
a
witch
nicholas
do
you
mark
the
word
and
yet
more
particular
is
the
next
verse
wherein
it
is
said
a
charmer
or
a
consulter
with
familiar
spirits
or
a
wizard
or
a
necromancer
and
then
cometh
the
denunciation
of
divine
anger
against
such
offenders
in
these
awful
words
all
that
do
these
things
are
an
abomination
unto
the
lord
and
because
of
these
abominations
the
lord
thy
god
doth
drive
them
out
from
before
thee
again
it
is
said
in
leviticus
that
lord
setteth
his
face
against
such
to
cut
them
off
and
in
exodus
the
law
is
expressly
laid
down
thus
shalt
not
suffer
a
witch
to
live
there
is
no
escape
for
her
you
see
by
the
divine
command
she
must
perish
and
human
justice
must
carry
out
the
decree
nicholas
i
am
one
of
the
offenders
thus
denounced
thus
condemned
i
have
practised
witchcraft
consulted
with
familiar
spirits
and
done
other
abominations
in
the
sight
of
heaven
and
i
ought
to
pay
the
full
penalty
of
my
offences
do
not
i
beseech
you
madam
replied
the
squire
continue
to
take
this
view
of
your
case
however
you
have
sinned
you
have
made
amends
by
the
depth
and
sincerity
of
your
repentance
your
days
and
nights
for
you
allow
yourself
only
such
rest
as
nature
forces
on
you
and
take
even
that
most
unwillingly
are
passed
in
constant
prayer
your
abstinence
is
severer
than
any
anchoress
ever
practised
for
i
am
sure
for
the
last
month
you
have
not
taken
as
much
food
altogether
as
i
consume
in
a
day
while
not
content
with
this
you
perform
acts
of
penance
that
afflict
me
beyond
measure
to
think
upon
and
which
i
have
striven
in
vain
to
induce
you
to
forego
there
will
be
no
occasion
to
deliver
yourself
up
to
justice
madam
for
if
you
go
on
thus
and
do
not
deal
with
yourself
a
little
more
mildly
your
accounts
with
this
world
will
be
speedily
settled
and
i
should
rejoice
to
think
so
nicholas
replied
mistress
nutter
if
i
had
any
hope
in
the
world
to
come
but
alas
i
have
none
i
can
not
by
any
act
of
penitence
and
contrition
expiate
my
offences
my
soul
is
darkened
by
despair
i
know
i
ought
to
give
myself
up
that
heaven
and
man
alike
require
my
life
and
i
can
not
reconcile
myself
to
avoiding
my
just
doom
it
is
the
evil
one
who
puts
these
thoughts
into
your
head
replied
nicholas
and
who
fills
your
heart
with
promptings
of
despair
that
he
may
again
obtain
the
mastery
over
it
but
take
a
calmer
and
more
consolatory
view
of
your
condition
human
justice
may
require
a
public
sacrifice
as
an
example
but
heaven
will
be
satisfied
with
contrition
in
secret
i
trust
so
replied
the
lady
vainly
striving
to
draw
comfort
from
his
words
oh
nicholas
you
do
not
know
the
temptations
i
am
exposed
to
in
this
chamber
the
difficulty
i
experience
in
keeping
my
thoughts
fixed
on
one
object
the
distractions
i
undergo
the
mental
obscurations
the
faintings
of
spirit
the
bodily
prostration
the
terrors
the
inconceivable
terrors
that
assail
me
sometimes
i
wish
my
spirit
would
flee
away
and
be
at
rest
rest
there
is
none
for
me
none
in
the
grave
none
beyond
the
grave
and
therefore
i
am
afraid
of
death
and
still
more
of
the
judgment
after
death
man
might
inflict
all
the
tortures
he
could
devise
upon
this
poor
frame
i
would
bear
them
all
with
patience
with
delight
if
i
thought
they
would
purchase
me
immunity
hereafter
but
with
the
dread
conviction
the
almost
certainty
that
it
will
be
otherwise
i
can
only
look
to
the
final
consummation
with
despair
again
i
tell
you
these
suggestions
are
evil
said
nicholas
the
son
of
god
who
sacrificed
himself
for
man
and
by
whose
atonement
all
mankind
hope
for
salvation
has
assured
us
that
the
greatest
sinner
who
repents
shall
be
forgiven
and
indeed
is
more
acceptable
in
the
eyes
of
heaven
than
him
who
has
never
erred
far
be
it
from
me
to
attempt
to
exculpate
you
in
your
own
eyes
or
extenuate
your
former
criminality
you
have
sinned
deeply
so
deeply
that
you
may
well
shrink
aghast
from
the
contemplation
of
your
past
life
may
well
recoil
in
abhorrence
from
yourself
and
may
fitly
devote
yourself
to
constant
prayer
and
acts
of
penitence
but
having
cast
off
your
iniquity
and
sincerely
repented
i
bid
you
hope
i
bid
you
place
a
confident
reliance
in
the
clemency
of
an
power
you
give
me
much
comfort
nicholas
said
the
lady
and
if
tears
of
blood
can
wash
away
my
sin
they
shall
be
shed
but
much
as
you
know
of
my
wickedness
even
you
can
not
conceive
its
extent
in
my
madness
for
it
was
nothing
else
i
cast
off
all
hopes
of
heaven
renounced
my
redeemer
was
baptised
by
the
demon
and
entered
into
a
compact
by
which
i
shudder
to
speak
it
my
soul
was
surrendered
to
him
you
placed
yourself
in
fearful
jeopardy
no
doubt
rejoined
nicholas
but
you
have
broken
the
contract
in
time
and
an
all
righteous
judge
will
not
permit
the
penalty
of
the
bond
to
be
exacted
seeing
your
penitence
satan
has
relinquished
all
claim
to
your
soul
i
do
not
think
it
replied
the
lady
he
will
contest
the
point
to
the
last
and
it
is
only
at
the
last
that
it
will
be
decided
as
she
spoke
a
sound
like
mocking
laughter
reached
the
ears
of
nicholas
did
you
hear
that
demanded
mistress
nutter
in
accents
of
wildest
terror
he
is
ever
on
the
watch
i
knew
it
i
knew
it
clasping
her
hands
together
and
fixing
her
looks
on
high
she
then
addressed
the
most
fervent
supplications
to
heaven
for
deliverance
from
evil
and
erelong
her
troubled
countenance
began
to
resume
its
former
serenity
proving
that
the
surest
balm
for
a
mind
diseased
is
prayer
her
example
had
been
followed
by
nicholas
who
greatly
alarmed
had
dropped
upon
his
knees
likewise
and
now
arose
with
somewhat
more
composure
in
his
demeanour
and
aspect
i
am
sorry
i
do
not
bring
you
good
news
madam
he
said
but
jem
device
has
been
arrested
this
morning
and
as
the
fellow
is
greatly
exasperated
against
me
he
threatens
to
betray
your
retreat
to
the
officers
and
though
he
is
probably
unacquainted
with
it
notwithstanding
his
boasting
still
he
may
cause
search
to
be
made
and
therefore
i
think
you
had
better
be
removed
to
some
other
deliver
me
up
without
more
ado
i
pray
you
nicholas
said
the
lady
you
know
my
resolution
on
that
point
madam
he
replied
and
therefore
it
is
idle
to
attempt
to
shake
it
for
your
daughter
sake
if
not
for
your
own
i
will
save
you
in
spite
of
yourself
you
would
not
fix
a
brand
for
ever
on
alizon
name
you
would
not
destroy
her
i
would
not
replied
the
wretched
lady
but
have
you
heard
from
her
have
you
seen
her
tell
me
is
she
well
and
happy
she
is
well
and
would
be
happy
were
it
not
for
her
anxiety
about
you
replied
nicholas
evasively
but
for
her
sake
mine
your
own
i
must
urge
you
to
seek
some
other
place
of
refuge
to
night
for
if
you
are
discovered
here
you
will
bring
ruin
on
us
all
i
will
no
longer
debate
the
point
replied
mistress
nutter
where
shall
i
go
there
is
one
place
of
absolute
security
but
i
do
not
like
to
mention
it
replied
nicholas
yet
still
as
it
will
only
be
necessary
to
remain
for
a
day
or
two
till
the
search
is
over
when
you
can
return
here
it
can
not
much
matter
where
is
it
asked
mistress
nutter
malkin
tower
answered
the
squire
with
some
hesitation
i
will
never
go
to
that
accursed
place
cried
the
lady
send
me
hence
when
you
will
now
or
at
midnight
and
let
me
seek
shelter
on
the
bleak
fells
or
on
the
desolate
moors
but
bid
me
not
go
there
and
yet
it
is
the
best
and
safest
place
for
you
returned
nicholas
somewhat
testily
and
for
this
reason
that
being
reputed
to
be
haunted
no
one
will
venture
to
molest
you
as
to
mother
demdike
i
suppose
you
are
not
afraid
of
her
ghost
and
if
the
evil
beings
you
apprehend
were
able
or
inclined
to
do
you
mischief
they
would
not
wait
till
you
got
there
to
execute
their
purpose
true
said
mistress
nutter
i
was
wrong
to
hesitate
i
will
go
you
will
be
as
safe
there
as
here
ay
and
safer
rejoined
nicholas
or
i
would
not
urge
the
retreat
upon
you
i
am
about
to
ride
over
to
middleton
this
morning
to
see
your
daughter
and
richard
assheton
and
shall
sleep
at
whalley
so
that
i
shall
not
be
able
to
accompany
you
to
the
tower
but
old
crouch
the
huntsman
shall
be
in
waiting
for
you
as
soon
as
it
grows
dusk
in
the
with
which
as
you
know
the
secret
staircase
connected
with
this
room
communicates
and
he
shall
have
a
horse
in
readiness
to
take
you
together
with
such
matters
as
you
may
require
to
the
place
of
refuge
heaven
guard
you
madam
amen
responded
the
lady
and
now
farewell
said
nicholas
i
shall
hope
to
see
you
back
again
ere
many
days
be
gone
when
your
quietude
will
not
again
be
disturbed
so
saying
he
stepped
back
and
passing
through
the
panel
closed
it
after
him
chapter
middleton

middleton
hall
the
residence
of
sir
richard
assheton
was
a
large
quadrangular
structure
built
entirely
of
timber
and
painted
externally
in
black
and
white
fanciful
and
varied
in
design
in
the
style
peculiar
to
the
better
class
of
tudor
houses
in
south
lancashire
and
cheshire
surrounded
by
a
deep
moat
supplied
by
a
neighbouring
stream
and
crossed
by
four
drawbridges
each
faced
by
a
gateway
this
vast
pile
of
building
was
divided
into
two
spacious
courts
one
of
which
contained
the
stables
barns
and
offices
while
the
other
was
reserved
for
the
family
and
the
guests
by
whom
the
hospitable
mansion
was
almost
constantly
crowded
in
the
part
of
the
house
was
a
great
gallery
with
deeply
embayed
windows
filled
with
painted
glass
a
floor
of
polished
oak
walls
of
the
same
dark
lustrous
material
hung
with
portraits
of
stiff
beauties
some
in
ruff
and
farthingale
and
some
in
a
costume
of
an
earlier
period
among
whom
was
margaret
barton
who
brought
the
manor
of
middleton
into
the
family
frowning
warriors
beginning
with
sir
ralph
assheton
of
england
in
the
reign
of
edward
and
surnamed
the
black

the
founder
of
the
house
and

of

and
ending
with
sir
richard

mantelpiece
massive
tables
of
walnut
or
oak
and
black
and
shining
as
ebony
set
round
with
chairs
here
also
above
stairs
there
were
long
corridors
looking
out
through
lattices
upon
the
court
and
communicating
with
the
almost
countless
dormitories
while
on
the
floor
beneath
corresponding
passages
led
to
all
the
principal
chambers
and
terminated
in
the
grand
entrance
hall
the
roof
of
which
being
open
and
intersected
by
enormous
rafters
and
crooks
of
oak
like
the
ribs
of
some
tall
ammiral
was
thought
from
this
circumstance
as
well
as
from
its
form
to
resemble
a
ship
turned
upside
down
the
lower
beams
were
elaborately
carved
and
ornamented
with
gilded
bosses
and

images
sustaining

emblazoned
with
the
armorial

of

as
many
as

ranged
round
the
besides
corselets

accoutrements
this
stand
of

having
been
collected
by
sir

made
in
the
country
in
when
he
had
raised
and
equipped
a
troop
of
horse
for
queen
elizabeth
outside
the
mansion
was
a
garden
charmingly
laid
out
in
parterres
and
walks
and
not
only
carried
to
the
edge
of
the
moat
but
continued
beyond
it
till
it
reached
a
high
knoll
crowned
with
a
crest
of
tall
twisted
chimneys
a
high
roof
with
quaintly
carved
gables
surmounted
by
many
gilt
vanes
may
serve
to
complete
the
picture
of
middleton
hall
on
a
lovely
summer
evening
two
young
persons
of
opposite
sexes
were
seated
on
a
bench
placed
at
the
foot
of
one
of
the
largest
and
most
umbrageous
of
the
crowning
the
pleasant
eminence
before
mentioned
and
though
differing
in
aspect
and
character
the
one
being
excessively
fair
with
tresses
as
light
and
fleecy
as
the
clouds
above
them
and
eyes
as
blue
and
tender
as
the
skies
and
the
other
distinguished
by
great
manly
beauty
though
in
a
totally
different
style
still
there
was
a
sufficiently
strong
likeness
between
them
to
proclaim
them
brother
and
sister
profound
melancholy
pervaded
the
countenance
of
the
young
man
whose
handsome
brow
was
clouded
by
care
while
the
girl
though
sad
seemed
so
only
from
sympathy
they
were
conversing
together
in
deep
and
earnest
tones
showing
how
greatly
they
were
interested
and
as
they
proceeded
many
an
involuntary
sigh
was
heaved
by
richard
assheton
while
a
tear
more
than
once
dimmed
the
brightness
of
his
sister
eyes
and
her
hand
sought
by
its
gentle
pressure
to
him
they
were
talking
of
alizon
of
her
peculiar
and
distressing
situation
and
of
the
young
man
hopeless
love
for
her
she
was
the
general
theme
of
their
discourse
for
richard
sole
comfort
was
in
pouring
forth
his
griefs
into
his
sister
willing
ear
but
new
causes
of
anxiety
had
been
given
them
by
nicholas
who
had
arrived
that
afternoon
bringing
intelligence
of
james
device
capture
and
of
his
threats
against
mistress
nutter
the
squire
had
only
just
departed
having
succeeded
in
the
twofold
object
of
his
visit
which
was
firstly
to
borrow
three
hundred
pounds
from
his
cousin
and
secondly
to
induce
him
to
attend
the
meeting
at
hoghton
tower
with
the
first
request
richard
willingly
complied
and
he
assented
though
with
some
reluctance
to
the
second
provided
nothing
of
serious
moment
should
occur
in
the
interim
nicholas
tried
to
rally
him
on
his
despondency
endeavouring
to
convince
him
all
would
come
right
in
time
and
that
his
misgivings
were
causeless
but
his
arguments
were
ineffectual
and
he
was
soon
compelled
to
desist
the
squire
would
fain
also
have
seen
alizon
but
understanding
she
always
remained
secluded
in
her
chamber
till
eventide
he
did
not
press
the
point
richard
urged
him
to
stay
over
the
night
alleging
the
length
of
the
ride
and
the
speedy
approach
of
evening
as
inducements
to
him
to
remain
but
on
this
score
the
squire
was
resolute
and
having
carefully
secured
the
large
sum
of
money
he
had
obtained
beneath
his
doublet
he
mounted
his
favourite
steed
robin
who
seemed
as
fresh
as
if
he
had
not
achieved
upwards
of
thirty
miles
that
morning
and
rode
off
richard
watched
him
cross
the
drawbridge
and
take
the
road
towards
rochdale
and
after
exchanging
a
farewell
wave
of
the
hand
with
him
returned
to
the
hall
and
sought
out
his
sister
dorothy
was
easily
persuaded
to
take
a
turn
in
the
garden
with
her
brother
and
during
their
walk
he
confided
to
her
all
he
had
heard
from
nicholas
her
alarm
at
jem
device
threat
was
much
greater
than
his
own
and
though
she
entertained
a
strong
and
unconquerable
aversion
to
mistress
nutter
and
could
not
be
brought
to
believe
in
the
sincerity
of
her
penitence
still
for
alizon
sake
she
dreaded
lest
any
harm
should
befall
her
and
more
particularly
desired
to
avoid
the
disgrace
which
would
be
inflicted
by
a
public
execution
alizon
she
was
sure
would
not
survive
such
a
catastrophe
and
therefore
at
all
risks
it
must
be
averted
richard
did
not
share
to
the
same
extent
in
her
apprehensions
because
he
had
been
assured
by
nicholas
that
mistress
nutter
would
be
removed
to
a
place
of
perfect
security
and
because
he
was
disposed
with
the
squire
to
regard
the
prisoner
threats
as
mere
ravings
of
impotent
malice
still
he
could
not
help
feeling
great
uneasiness
vague
fears
too
beset
him
which
he
found
it
in
vain
to
shake
off
but
he
did
not
communicate
them
to
his
sister
as
he
knew
the
terrifying
effect
they
would
have
upon
her
timid
nature
and
he
therefore
kept
the
mental
anguish
he
endured
to
himself
hoping
erelong
it
would
diminish
in
intensity
but
in
this
he
was
deceived
for
instead
of
abating
his
gloom
and
depression
momently
increased
almost
unconsciously
richard
and
his
sister
had
quitted
the
garden
proceeding
with
slow
and
melancholy
steps
to
the
knoll
the
seat
they
had
chosen
was
a
favourite
one
with
alizon
and
she
came
thither
on
most
evenings
either
accompanied
by
dorothy
or
alone
here
it
was
that
richard
had
more
than
once
passionately
besought
her
to
become
his
bride
receiving
on
both
occasions
a
same
meek
yet
firm
refusal
to
dorothy
also
who
pleaded
her
brother
cause
with
all
the
eloquence
and
fervour
of
which
she
was
mistress
alizon
replied
that
her
affections
were
fixed
upon
richard
but
that
while
her
mother
lived
and
needed
her
constant
prayers
they
must
not
be
withheld
and
that
looking
upon
any
earthly
passion
as
a
criminal
interference
with
this
paramount
duty
she
did
not
dare
to
indulge
it
dorothy
represented
to
her
that
the
sacrifice
was
greater
than
she
was
called
upon
to
make
that
her
health
was
visibly
declining
and
that
she
might
fall
a
victim
to
her
but
alizon
was
deaf
to
her
remonstrances
as
she
had
been
to
the
entreaties
of
richard
with
hearts
less
burthened
the
contemplation
of
the
scene
before
them
could
not
have
failed
to
give
delight
to
richard
and
his
sister
and
even
amid
the
adverse
circumstances
under
which
it
was
viewed
its
beauty
and
tranquillity
produced
a
soothing
influence
evening
was
gradually
stealing
on
and
all
the
exquisite
tints
marking
that
delightful
hour
were
spreading
over
the
landscape
the
sun
was
setting
gorgeously
and
a
flood
of
radiance
fell
upon
the
old
mansion
beneath
them
and
upon
the
grey
and
venerable
church
situated
on
a
hill
adjoining
it
the
sounds
were
all
in
unison
with
the
hour
and
the
lowing
of
cattle
the
voices
of
the
husbandmen
returning
from
their
work
mingled
with
the
cawing
of
the
rooks
newly
alighted
on
the
high
trees
near
the
church
told
them
that
bird
man
and
beast
were
seeking
their
home
for
the
night
but
though
richard
eye
dwelt
upon
the
fair
garden
beneath
him
embracing
all
its
terraces
green
slopes
and
trim
pastures
though
it
fell
upon
the
moat
belting
the
hall
like
a
glittering
zone
though
it
rested
upon
the
church
tower
and
roaming
over
the
park
beyond
it
finally
settled
upon
the
range
of
hills
bounding
the
horizon
which
have
not
inaptly
been
termed
the
english
apennines
though
he
saw
all
these
things
he
thought
not
of
them
neither
was
he
conscious
of
the
sounds
that
met
his
ear
and
which
all
spoke
of
rest
from
labour
and
peace
darker
and
deeper
grew
his
melancholy
he
began
to
persuade
himself
he
was
not
long
for
this
world
and
while
gazing
upon
the
beautiful
prospect
before
him
was
perhaps
looking
upon
it
for
the
last
time
for
some
minutes
dorothy
watched
him
anxiously
and
at
last
receiving
no
answer
to
her
questions
and
alarmed
by
the
expression
of
his
countenance
she
flung
her
arms
round
his
neck
and
burst
into
tears
it
was
now
richard
turn
to
console
her
and
he
inquired
with
much
anxiety
as
to
the
cause
of
this
sudden
outburst
of
grief
you
yourself
are
the
cause
of
it
dear
richard
replied
dorothy
regarding
him
with
brimming
eyes
i
can
not
bear
to
see
you
so
unhappy
if
you
suffer
this
melancholy
to
grow
upon
you
it
will
affect
both
mind
and
body
just
now
your
countenance
wore
an
expression
most
distressing
to
look
upon
try
to
smile
dear
richard
if
only
to
cheer
me
or
else
i
shall
grow
as
sad
as
you
ah
me
i
have
known
the
day
and
not
long
since
either
when
on
a
pleasant
summer
evening
like
this
you
would
propose
a
stroll
into
the
park
with
me
and
when
there
would
trip
along
the
glades
as
fleetly
as
a
deer
and
defy
me
to
catch
you
but
you
always
took
care
i
should
though
ha
ha
come
there
is
a
little
attempt
at
a
smile
that
something
you
look
more
like
yourself
now
how
happy
we
used
to
be
in
those
days
to
be
sure
and
how
merry
you
would
make
the
courts
ring
with
your
blithe
laughter
and
wellnigh
kill
me
with
your
jests
if
love
is
to
make
one
mope
like
an
owl
and
sigh
like
the
wind
through
a
casement
if
it
is
to
cause
one
to
lose
one
rosy
complexion
and
gay
spirit
and
forget
how
to
dance
and
sing
take
no
pleasure
in
hawking
and
hunting
or
any
kind
of
sport
walk
about
with
eyes
fixed
upon
the
ground
muttering
and
with
disordered
attire
if
it
is
to
make
one
silent
when
one
should
be
talkative
grave
when
one
should
be
gay
heedless
when
one
should
listen
if
it
is
to
do
all
this
defend
me
from
the
tender
passion
i
hope
i
shall
never
fall
in
love
i
hope
you
never
will
dear
dorothy
replied
richard
pressing
her
hand
affectionately
if
your
love
is
to
be
attended
with
such
unhappy
results
as
mine
i
know
not
how
it
is
but
i
feel
unusually
despondent
this
evening
and
am
haunted
by
a
thousand
dismal
fancies
but
i
will
do
my
best
to
dismiss
them
and
with
your
help
no
doubt
i
shall
succeed
there
there
was
a
smile
in
earnest
cried
dorothy
brightening
up
oh
richard
i
am
quite
happy
now
and
after
all
i
do
not
see
why
you
should
take
such
a
gloomy
view
of
things
i
have
no
doubt
there
is
a
great
deal
a
very
great
deal
of
happiness
in
store
for
you
and
alizon
i
must
couple
her
name
with
yours
or
you
will
not
allow
it
to
be
happiness
if
you
can
only
be
brought
to
think
so
i
am
quite
sure
of
it
and
you
shall
see
how
nicely
i
can
make
the
matter
out
as
thus
mistress
nutter
is
certain
to
die
soon
such
a
wicked
woman
can
not
live
long
do
be
angry
with
me
for
calling
her
wicked
richard
but
you
know
i
never
can
forget
her
unhallowed
proceedings
in
the
convent
church
at
whalley
where
i
was
so
nearly
becoming
a
witch
myself
well
as
i
was
saying
she
can
not
live
long
and
when
she
goes
and
heaven
grant
it
may
be
soon
alizon
no
doubt
will
mourn
for
her
though
i
shall
not
and
after
a
decent
interval
then
richard
then
she
will
no
longer
say
you
nay
but
will
make
you
happy
as
your
wife
nay
do
not
look
so
sad
again
dear
brother
i
thought
i
should
make
you
quite
cheerful
by
the
picture
i
was
drawing
it
is
because
i
fear
it
will
never
be
realized
that
i
am
sad
dorothy
replied
richard
my
own
anticipations
are
the
opposite
of
yours
and
paint
alizon
sinking
into
an
early
grave
before
her
mother
while
as
to
myself
if
such
be
the
case
i
shall
not
long
survive
her
nay
now
you
will
make
me
weep
again
cried
dorothy
her
tears
flowing
afresh
but
i
will
not
allow
you
to
indulge
such
gloomy
ideas
richard
if
i
seriously
thought
mistress
nutter
likely
to
occasion
all
this
fresh
mischief
i
would
cause
her
to
be
delivered
up
to
justice
and
hanged
out
of
the
way
you
may
look
cross
at
me
but
i
would
what
is
an
old
witch
like
her
compared
with
two
young
handsome
persons
dying
for
love
of
each
other
and
yet
not
able
to
marry
on
her
account
dorothy
dorothy
you
must
put
some
restraint
on
your
tongue
said
richard
you
give
it
sadly
too
much
licence
you
forget
it
is
the
wish
of
the
unhappy
lady
you
refer
to
to
expiate
her
offences
at
the
stake
and
that
it
is
only
out
of
consideration
to
her
daughter
that
she
has
been
induced
to
remain
in
concealment
what
will
be
the
issue
of
it
all
i
dare
scarcely
conjecture
wo
to
her
i
fear
wo
to
alizon
wo
to
me
alas
richard
that
you
should
link
yourself
to
her
fate
exclaimed
dorothy
half
mournfully
half
reproachfully
i
can
not
help
it
he
replied
it
is
my
destiny
a
deplorable
destiny
if
you
will
but
not
to
be
avoided
that
mistress
nutter
will
escape
the
consequences
of
her
crimes
i
can
scarcely
believe
her
penitence
is
profound
and
sincere
and
that
is
a
great
consolation
for
i
trust
she
will
not
perish
body
and
soul
i
should
wish
her
to
have
some
spiritual
assistance
but
this
nicholas
will
not
for
the
present
permit
alleging
that
no
churchman
would
consent
to
screen
her
from
justice
when
he
became
aware
as
he
must
by
her
confession
of
the
nature
and
magnitude
of
her
offences
this
may
be
true
but
when
the
wretches
who
have
been
leagued
with
her
in
iniquity
are
disposed
of
the
reason
will
no
longer
exist
and
i
will
see
that
she
is
cared
for
but
apart
from
her
mother
i
have
another
source
of
anxiety
respecting
alizon
it
is
this
orders
have
been
this
day
given
for
the
arrest
of
elizabeth
device
and
her
daughter
jennet
and
alizon
will
be
the
chief
witness
against
them
this
will
be
a
great
trouble
to
her
undoubtedly
rejoined
dorothy
with
much
concern
but
can
it
not
be
avoided
i
fear
not
said
richard
and
i
blamed
nicholas
much
for
his
precipitancy
in
giving
the
order
but
he
replied
he
had
been
held
up
latterly
as
a
favourer
of
witches
and
must
endeavour
to
redeem
his
character
by
a
display
of
severity
were
it
not
for
alizon
i
should
rejoice
that
the
noxious
brood
should
at
last
be
utterly
exterminated
and
so
should
i
in
good
sooth
responded
dorothy
as
to
elizabeth
device
she
is
bad
enough
for
any
thing
and
capable
of
almost
any
mischief
but
she
is
nothing
to
jennet
who
i
am
persuaded
would
become
a
second
mother
demdike
if
her
career
were
not
cut
short
you
have
seen
the
child
and
know
what
an
deformed
little
creature
she
is
with
round
high
shoulders
eyes
set
strangely
in
her
face
and
such
a
malicious
expression
oh
i
shudder
to
think
of
it
and
she
covered
her
face
with
her
hands
as
if
to
shut
out
some
unpleasant
object
poor
predestined
child
of
sin
branded
by
nature
from
her
birth
and
charged
with
wicked
passions
as
the
snake
with
venom
i
can
not
but
pity
her
exclaimed
richard
compassion
is
entirely
thrown
away
he
added
with
a
sudden
change
of
manner
and
as
if
trying
to
shake
off
a
weakness
the
poisonous
fruit
must
however
be
nipped
in
the
bud
better
she
should
perish
now
even
though
comparatively
guiltless
than
hereafter
with
a
soul
stained
with
crime
like
her
mother
as
he
concluded
he
put
his
hand
quickly
to
his
side
for
a
sharp
and
sudden
pang
shot
through
his
heart
and
so
acute
was
the
pain
that
after
struggling
against
it
for
a
moment
he
groaned
deeply
and
would
have
fallen
if
his
sister
greatly
alarmed
and
with
difficulty
repressing
a
scream
had
not
lent
him
support
neither
of
them
were
aware
of
the
presence
of
a
little
girl
who
had
approached
the
place
where
they
were
sitting
with
footsteps
so
light
that
the
grass
scarcely
seemed
to
bend
beneath
them
and
who
ensconcing
herself
behind
the
tree
drank
in
their
discourse
with
eager
ears
she
was
attended
by
a
large
black
cat
who
climbing
the
tree
placed
himself
on
a
bough
above
her
during
the
latter
part
of
the
conversation
and
when
it
turned
upon
the
arrest
of
jennet
and
her
mother
the
expression
of
the
countenance
malicious
enough
to
begin
with
became
desperately
malignant
and
she
was
only
restrained
by
certain
signs
from
the
cat
which
appeared
to
be
intelligible
to
her
from
some
act
of
mischief
at
last
even
this
failed
and
before
the
animal
could
descend
and
check
her
she
crept
round
the
bole
of
the
tree
so
as
to
bring
herself
close
to
richard
and
muttering
a
spell
made
one
or
two
passes
behind
his
back
touched
him
with
the
point
of
her
finger
but
so
lightly
that
he
was
unconscious
of
the
pressure
and
then
hastily
retreated
with
the
cat
who
glared
furiously
at
her
from
his
flaming
orbs
it
was
at
the
moment
she
touched
him
that
richard
felt
as
if
an
arrow
were
quivering
in
his
heart
poor
dorothy
alarm
was
so
great
that
she
could
not
even
scream
for
assistance
and
she
feared
if
she
quitted
her
brother
he
would
expire
before
her
return
but
the
agony
though
great
was
speedily
over
and
as
the
spasm
ceased
he
looked
up
and
with
a
faint
smile
strove
to
her
do
not
be
alarmed
he
said
it
is
nothing
a
momentary
faintness
that
is
all
but
the
damp
upon
his
brow
and
the
deathly
hue
of
his
cheek
contradicted
the
assertion
and
showed
how
much
he
had
endured
it
was
more
than
momentary
faintness
dear
richard
replied
dorothy
it
was
a
frightful
seizure
so
frightful
that
i
almost
feared
but
no
matter
you
know
i
am
easily
alarmed
thank
god
here
is
some
colour
coming
into
your
cheeks
you
are
better
now
i
see
lean
upon
me
and
let
us
return
to
the
house
i
can
walk
unassisted
said
richard
rising
with
an
effort
do
not
despise
my
feeble
aid
replied
dorothy
taking
his
arm
under
her
own
you
will
be
quite
well
soon
i
am
quite
well
now
said
richard
halting
after
he
had
advanced
a
few
paces
the
attack
is
altogether
passed
do
you
not
see
alizon
coming
towards
us
not
a
word
of
this
sudden
seizure
to
her
do
you
mind
dorothy
alizon
was
soon
close
behind
them
and
though
in
obedience
to
injunctions
no
allusion
was
made
to
his
recent
illness
she
at
once
perceived
he
was
suffering
greatly
and
with
much
solicitude
inquired
into
the
cause
richard
avoided
giving
a
direct
answer
and
immediately
entering
upon
nicholas
visit
tried
to
divert
her
attention
from
himself
so
great
a
change
had
been
wrought
in
alizon
appearance
and
manner
during
the
last
few
weeks
that
she
could
scarcely
be
recognised
still
beautiful
as
ever
her
beauty
had
lost
its
earthly
character
and
had
become
in
the
highest
degree
spiritualised
and
refined
humility
of
deportment
and
resignation
of
look
blended
with
an
expression
of
religious
fervour
gave
her
the
appearance
of
one
of
the
early
martyrs
unremitting
ardour
in
the
pursuance
of
her
devotional
exercises
by
day
and
long
vigils
at
night
had
worn
down
her
frame
and
robbed
it
of
some
of
its
grace
and
fulness
of
outline
but
this
attenuation
had
a
charm
of
its
own
and
gave
a
touching
interest
to
her
figure
which
was
wanting
before
if
her
check
was
thinner
and
paler
her
eyes
looked
larger
and
brighter
and
more
akin
to
the
stars
in
splendour
and
if
she
appeared
less
childlike
less
joyous
less
free
from
care
the
want
of
these
qualities
was
more
than
counterbalanced
by
increased
gentleness
resignation
and
serenity
deeply
interested
in
all
richard
told
her
of
her
mother
she
was
greatly
concerned
to
hear
of
the
intended
arrest
of
elizabeth
and
jennet
device
especially
the
latter
for
this
unhappy
and
misguided
child
she
had
once
entertained
the
affection
of
a
sister
and
it
could
not
but
be
a
source
of
grief
to
her
to
reflect
upon
her
probable
fate
little
more
passed
between
them
for
richard
feeling
his
strength
again
fail
him
was
anxious
to
reach
the
house
and
dorothy
was
quite
unequal
to
conversation
they
parted
at
the
door
and
as
alizon
after
taking
leave
of
her
friends
turned
to
continue
her
walk
in
the
garden
richard
staggered
into
the
and
sank
upon
a
chair
alizon
desired
to
be
alone
for
she
did
not
wish
to
have
a
witness
to
the
grief
that
overpowered
her
and
which
when
she
had
gained
a
retired
part
of
the
garden
where
she
supposed
herself
free
from
all
observation
found
relief
in
a
flood
of
tears
for
some
minutes
she
was
a
prey
to
violent
and
irrepressible
emotion
and
had
scarcely
regained
a
show
of
composure
when
she
heard
herself
addressed
as
she
thought
in
the
voice
of
the
very
child
whose
unlucky
fate
she
was
deploring
looking
round
in
surprise
and
seeing
no
one
she
began
to
think
fancy
must
have
cheated
her
when
a
low
malicious
laugh
arising
from
a
shrubbery
near
her
convinced
her
that
jennet
was
hidden
there
and
the
next
moment
the
little
girl
stepped
from
out
the
trees
alizon
first
impulse
was
to
catch
the
child
in
her
arms
and
press
her
to
her
bosom
but
there
was
something
in
jennet
look
that
deterred
her
and
so
embarrassed
her
that
she
was
unable
to
bestow
upon
her
the
ordinary
greeting
of
affection
or
even
approach
her
jennet
seemed
to
enjoy
her
confusion
and
laughed
spitefully
yo
dunna
seem
ower
glad
to
see
me
sister
alizon
said
jennet
at
length
alizon
there
was
something
in
the
term
that
now
jarred
upon
the
young
girl
ears
but
she
strove
to
conquer
the
feeling
as
unworthy
of
her
she
was
once
my
sister
she
thought
and
shall
be
so
still
i
will
save
her
if
it
be
possible
jennet
she
added
aloud
i
know
not
what
chance
brings
you
here
and
though
i
may
not
give
you
the
welcome
you
expect
i
am
rejoiced
to
see
you
because
i
may
be
the
means
of
serving
you
do
not
be
alarmed
at
what
i
am
going
to
tell
you
the
danger
i
hope
is
passed
or
at
all
events
may
be
avoided
your
liberty
is
threatened
and
at
the
very
moment
i
see
you
here
i
was
lamenting
your
supposed
condition
as
a
prisoner
jennet
laughed
louder
and
more
spitefully
than
before
and
looked
so
like
a
little
fury
that
alizon
blood
ran
cold
at
the
sight
of
it
ey
knoa
it
aw

alizon
she
cried

that

jennet
i

rejoined
alizon
indignantly
varry

jennet
with
a
look
of
concentrated
malice
and
fury

tak
the
consequences

jennet
what

tib
and
at
the
call
the
huge
black
cat
sprang
from
out
the
shrubbery
tear
her
flesh
from
her
bones
cried
the
little
girl
pointing
to
alizon
and
stamping
furiously
on
the
ground
tib
erected
his
back
and
glared
like
a
tiger
but
he
seemed
unwilling
or
unable
to
obey
the
order
alizon
who
had
completely
recovered
her
courage
regarded
him
fixedly
and
apparently
without
terror
whoy
dusna

cried
the
infuriated
child
he

alizon
oh

wicked
agent

chapter
the
gorge
of
cliviger
the
sun
had
already
set
as
nicholas
assheton
reached
todmorden
then
a
very
small
village
indeed
and
alighting
at
a
little
inn
near
the
church
found
the
ale
so
good
and
so
many
boon
companions
assembled
to
discuss
it
that
he
would
fain
have
tarried
with
them
for
an
hour
or
so
but
prudence
for
once
getting
the
better
of
inclination
and
suggesting
that
he
had
fifteen
or
sixteen
miles
still
to
ride
over
a
rough
and
lonely
road
part
of
which
lay
through
the
gorge
of
cliviger
a
long
and
solitary
pass
among
the
english
apennines
and
moreover
had
a
large
sum
of
money
about
him
he
tore
himself
away
by
a
great
effort
on
quitting
the
smiling
valley
of
todmorden
and
drawing
near
the
dangerous
defile
before
mentioned
some
misgivings
crossed
him
and
he
almost
reproached
himself
with
foolhardiness
in
venturing
within
it
at
such
an
hour
and
wholly
unattended
several
recent
cases
of
robbery
some
of
them
attended
by
murder
had
occurred
within
the
pass
and
these
now
occurred
so
forcibly
to
the
squire
that
he
was
half
inclined
to
ride
back
to
todmorden
and
engage
two
or
three
of
the
topers
he
had
left
at
the
inn
to
serve
him
as
an
escort
as
far
as
burnley
but
he
dismissed
the
idea
almost
as
soon
as
formed
and
casting
one
look
at
the
green
and
woody
slopes
around
him
struck
spurs
into
robin
and
dashed
into
the
gorge
on
the
right
towered
a
precipice
on
the
bare
crest
of
which
stood
a
heap
of
stones
piled
like
a
column
the
remains
probably
of
a
cairn
on
this
commanding
point
nicholas
perceived
a
female
figure
dilated
to
gigantic
proportions
against
the
sky
who
as
far
as
he
could
distinguish
seemed
watching
him
and
making
signs
to
him
apparently
to
go
back
but
he
paid
little
regard
to
them
and
soon
afterwards
lost
sight
of
her
precipitous
and
almost
inaccessible
rocks
of
every
variety
of
form
and
hue
some
springing
perpendicularly
up
like
the
spire
of
a
church
others
running
along
in
broken
ridges
or
presenting
the
appearance
of
high
embattled
walls
here
riven
into
deep
gullies
there
opening
into
wild
savage
glens
fit
spots
for
robber
ambuscade
now
presenting
a
fair
smooth
surface
now
jagged
shattered
shelving
roughened
with
brushwood
sometimes
bleached
and
hoary
as
in
the
case
of
the
pinnacled
crag
called
the
white
kirk
sometimes
green
with
moss
or
grey
with
lichen
sometimes
though
but
rarely
shaded
with
timber
as
in
the
approach
to
the
cavern
named
the
earl
bower
but
generally
bold
and
naked
and
sombre
in
tint
as
the
colours
employed
by
the
savage
rosa
such
were
the
distinguishing
features
of
the
gorge
of
cliviger
when
nicholas
traversed
it
now
the
high
embankments
and
mighty
arches
of
a
railway
fill
up
its
recesses
and
span
its
gullies
the
roar
of
the
engine
is
heard
where
the
cry
of
the
bird
of
prey
alone
resounded
and
clouds
of
steam
usurp
the
place
of
the
on
its
crags
formerly
the
high
cliffs
abounded
with
hawks
the
rocks
echoed
with
their
yells
and
screeches
and
the
spots
adjoining
their
nests
resembled
in
the
words
of
the
historian
of
the
district
whitaker
little
for
the
bones
of
game
formerly
also
on
some
inaccessible
point
built
the
and
reared
its
brood
from
year
to
year
the
gaunt
wolf
had
once
ravaged
the
glens
and
the
sly
fox
and
fierce
still
harboured
within
them
nor
were
those
the
only
objects
of
dread
the
superstitious
declared
the
gorge
was
haunted
by
a
frightful
hirsute
demon
yclept
hobthurst
the
general
savage
character
of
the
ravine
was
relieved
by
some
spots
of
exquisite
beauty
where
the
traveller
might
have
lingered
with
delight
if
apprehension
of
assault
from
robber
or
visit
from
hobthurst
had
not
urged
him
on
numberless
waterfalls
gushing
from
fissures
in
the
hills
coursed
down
their
seamy
sides
looking
like
threads
of
silver
as
they
sprang
from
point
to
point
one
of
the
most
beautiful
of
these
cascades
issuing
from
a
gully
in
the
rocks
near
the
cavern
called
the
bower
fell
in
rainy
seasons
in
one
unbroken
sheet
of
a
hundred
and
fifty
feet
through
the
midst
of
the
gorge
ran
a
swift
and
brawling
stream
known
by
the
appellation
of
the
calder
but
it
must
not
be
confounded
with
the
river
flowing
past
whalley
abbey
the
course
of
this
impetuous
current
was
not
always
restrained
within
its
rocky
channel
and
when
swollen
by
heavy
rains
it
would
frequently
invade
the
narrow
causeway
running
beside
it
and
spreading
over
the
whole
width
of
the
gorge
render
the
road
almost
impassable
through
this
rocky
and
sombre
defile
and
by
the
side
of
the
brawling
calder
which
dashed
swiftly
past
him
nicholas
took
his
way
the
hawks
were
yelling
overhead
the
rooks
were
cawing
on
the
topmost
branches
of
some
tall
timber
on
which
they
built
a
raven
was
croaking
lustily
in
the
wood
and
a
pair
of
eagles
were
soaring
in
the
still
glowing
sky
the
glen
contracted
and
a
wall
of
steep
rocks
on
either
side
hemmed
the
shuddering
traveller
in
instinctively
he
struck
spurs
into
his
horse
and
accelerated
his
pace
the
narrow
glen
expands
the
precipices
fall
further
back
and
the
traveller
breathes
more
freely
still
he
does
not
relax
his
speed
for
his
imagination
has
been
at
work
in
the
gloom
peopling
his
path
with
lurking
robbers
or
grinning
boggarts
he
begins
to
fear
he
shall
lose
his
gold
and
execrates
his
folly
for
incurring
such
heedless
risk
but
it
is
too
late
now
to
turn
back
it
grows
rapidly
dusk
and
objects
became
less
and
less
distinct
assuming
fantastical
and
fearful
forms
a
blasted
tree
clinging
to
a
rock
and
thrusting
a
bare
branch
across
the
road
looks
to
the
squire
like
a
bandit
and
a
white
owl
bursting
from
a
bush
scares
him
as
if
it
had
been
hobthurst
himself
however
in
spite
of
these
and
other
alarms
for
which
he
is
indebted
to
excited
fancy
he
hurries
on
and
is
proceeding
at
a
thundering
pace
when
all
at
once
his
horse
comes
to
a
stop
arrested
by
a
tall
female
figure
resembling
that
seen
near
the
mountain
cairn
at
the
entrance
of
the
gorge
nicholas
blood
ran
cold
for
though
in
this
case
he
could
not
apprehend
plunder
he
was
fearful
of
personal
injury
for
he
believed
the
woman
to
be
a
witch
mustering
up
courage
however
he
forced
robin
to
proceed
if
his
progress
was
meant
to
be
barred
a
better
spot
for
the
purpose
could
not
have
been
selected
a
narrow
road
scarcely
two
feet
in
width
ran
round
the
ledge
of
a
tremendous
crag
jutting
so
far
into
the
glen
that
it
almost
met
the
steep
barrier
of
rocks
opposite
it
between
these
precipitous
crags
dashed
the
river
in
a
foaming
cascade
nearly
twelve
feet
in
height
and
the
steep
narrow
causeway
winding
beside
it
as
above
described
was
rendered
excessively
slippery
and
dangerous
from
the
constant
cloud
of
spray
arising
from
the
fall
at
the
highest
and
narrowest
point
of
the
ledge
and
occupying
nearly
the
whole
of
its
space
with
an
overhanging
rock
on
one
side
of
her
and
a
roaring
torrent
on
the
other
stood
the
tall
woman
determined
apparently
from
her
attitude
and
deportment
to
oppose
the
further
progress
as
nicholas
advanced
he
became
convinced
that
it
was
the
same
person
he
had
seen
near
the
cairn
but
when
her
features
grew
distinguishable
he
found
to
his
surprise
that
it
was
nance

exclaimed
the

in
fresh
surprise
what
have
these
robbers
taken
up
their
quarters
there
this
accounts
for
all
the
strange
sights
said
to

of

and
which
i
treated
as
mere
fables

ah
a
terrible
thought
crosses
me
what

and
i

death

replied
nance
get
up
then
quickly
lass
since
it
must
be
so
rejoined
nicholas
with
this
he
moved
forward
and
giving
her
his
hand
she
was
instantly
seated
behind
him
upon
robin
who
seemed
no
way
incommoded
by
his
double
burthen
but
dashed
down
the
further
side
of
the
causeway
in
answer
to
a
sharp
application
of
the
spur
passing
her
arms
round
the
waist
nance
maintained
her
seat
well
and
in
this
way
they
rattled
along
heedless
of
the
increasing
difficulties
of
the
road
or
the
gloom
the
mile
was
quickly
passed
and
nance
whispered
in
the
squire
ear
that
they
were
approaching
the
boulder
stones
presently
they
came
to
a
narrow
glen
with
huge
rocky
fragments
detached
from
the
toppling
precipices
on
either
side
and
forming
an
admirable
place
of
ambuscade
one
rock
larger
than
the
rest
completely
commanded
the
pass
and
as
the
squire
advanced
a
thundering
voice
from
it
called
to
him
to
stay
and
the
injunction
being
disregarded
the
barrel
of
a
gun
was
protruded
from
the
bushes
covering
its
brow
and
a
shot
fired
at
him
though
well
aimed
the
ball
struck
the
ground
beneath
his
feet
and
nicholas
continued
his
way
unmoved
while
the
faulty
marksman
jumped
down
the
crag
at
the
same
time
four
other
men
started
from
their
places
of
concealment
behind
the
stones
and
levelling
their
calivers
at
the
fugitives
fired
the
sharp
discharges
echoed
along
the
gorge
and
the
shots
rattled
against
the
rocks
but
none
of
them
took
effect
and
nicholas
might
have
gone
on
without
further
hindrance
but
despite
nance
remonstrances
who
urged
him
to
go
on
he
pulled
up
to
await
the
coming
of
the
person
who
had
first
challenged
him
scarcely
an
instant
elapsed
before
he
was
beside
the
squire
and
presented
a
petronel
at
his
head
notwithstanding
the
gloom
nicholas
recognised
him
ah
is
it
thou
accursed
traitor
cried
nicholas
i
could
scarcely
believe
in
thy
villainy
but
now
i
am
convinced
the
jade
you
have
got
behind
you
has
told
you
who
i
am
i
see
replied
fogg
i
will
settle
with
her
anon
but
this
will
save
further
explanations
with
you
and
he
discharged
the
petronel
full
at
the
squire
but
the
ball
rebounded
as
if
his
doublet
had
been
quilted
it
was
in
fact
lined
with
gold
on
seeing
the
squire
unhurt
the
robber
captain
uttered
an
exclamation
of
rage
and
astonishment
you
are
mistaken
you
see
perfidious
villain
cried
nicholas
you
have
yet
to
render
an
account
of
all
the
wrongs
you
have
done
me
but
meantime
you
shall
not
pass
unpunished
and
as
he
spoke
he
snatched
the
petronel
from
fogg
and
with
the
dealt
him
a
tremendous
blow
on
the
head
felling
him
to
the
ground
by
this
time
the
other
robbers
had
descended
from
the
rocks
and
seeing
the
fall
of
their
leader
rushed
forward
to
avenge
him
but
nicholas
did
not
tarry
for
any
further
encounter
but
fully
satisfied
with
what
he
had
done
struck
spurs
into
robin
and
galloped
off
for
a
few
minutes
he
could
hear
the
shouts
of
the
men
but
they
soon
afterwards
died
away
little
more
than
half
the
ravine
had
been
traversed
when
the
rencounter
above
described
took
place
but
though
the
road
was
still
difficult
and
dangerous
and
rendered
doubly
so
by
the
obscurity
no
further
hindrance
occurred
till
just
as
nicholas
was
quitting
the
gloomy
intricacies
of
the
gorge
and
approaching
the
more
open
country
beyond
it
at
this
point
robin
fell
throwing
both
him
and
nance
and
when
the
animal
rose
again
he
was
found
to
be
so
much
injured
that
it
was
impossible
to
mount
him
there
was
no
resource
but
to
proceed
to
burnley
which
was
still
three
or
four
miles
distant
on
foot
in
this
dilemma
nance
volunteered
to
provide
the
squire
with
another
steed
but
he
resolutely
refused
the
offer
no
no
none
of
your
broomsticks
for
me
he
cried
no
horses
i
do
know
where
they
may
carry
me
my
own
legs
must
serve
me
now
i
just
take
poor
robin
out
of
the
road
and
then
trudge
off
for
burnley
as
fast
as
i
can
with
this
he
led
the
horse
to
a
small
green
mead
skirting
the
stream
and
taking
off
his
saddle
and
bridle
and
depositing
them
carefully
under
a
tree
he
patted
the
animal
on
the
neck
promising
to
return
for
him
on
the
morrow
and
then
set
off
at
a
brisk
pace
with
nance
walking
beside
him
they
had
not
gone
far
however
when
the
clattering
of
hoofs
was
heard
behind
them
and
it
was
evident
that
several
horsemen
were
rapidly
approaching
nance
stopped
listened
for
a
moment
and
then
declaring
that
it
was
demdike
and
his
band
in
pursuit
seized
the
squire
arm
and
drew
him
out
of
the
road
and
under
the
shelter
of
some
bushes
of
hazel
the
robber
captain
could
only
have
been
stunned
it
appeared
and
as
soon
as
he
had
recovered
from
the
effects
of
the
blow
had
mounted
his
horse
which
was
concealed
with
those
of
his
men
behind
the
rocks
and
started
after
the
fugitives
such
was
the
construction
put
upon
the
matter
by
nance
and
the
event
proved
it
correct
a
loud
shout
from
the
horsemen
and
a
sudden
halt
proclaimed
that
poor
robin
had
been
discovered
and
this
circumstance
seemed
to
give
great
satisfaction
to
demdike
who
loudly
declared
that
they
were
now
sure
of
overtaking
the
runaways
they
can
not
be
far
off
he
cried
but
they
will
most
likely
attempt
to
hide
themselves
so
look
well
about
you
so
saying
he
rode
on
and
it
was
evident
from
the
noise
that
the
men
implicitly
obeyed
his
injunctions
nothing
however
was
found
and
ere
many
minutes
demdike
came
up
and
glancing
at
the
hazels
behind
which
the
fugitives
were
hidden
he
discharged
a
petronel
into
the
largest
tree
but
as
no
movement
followed
the
report
he
said
i
thought
i
saw
something
move
here
but
i
suppose
i
was
mistaken
no
doubt
they
have
got
on
further
than
we
expected
or
have
retired
into
some
of
the
cloughs
in
which
case
it
will
be
useless
to
search
for
them
however
we
will
make
sure
of
them
in
this
way
two
of
you
shall
form
an
ambuscade
near
holme
and
two
further
on
within
half
a
mile
of
burnley
and
shall
remain
on
the
watch
till
dawn
so
that
you
will
be
sure
to
capture
them
and
when
taken
make
away
with
them
without
hesitation
unless
my
skull
had
been
of
the
strongest
that
butcherly
squire
would
have
cracked
it
so
he
shall
have
no
grace
from
me
and
as
to
that
treacherous
witch
nance
redferne
she
deserves
death
at
our
hands
and
she
shall
have
her
deserts
i
have
long
suspected
her
and
indeed
was
a
fool
to
trust
one
of
the
vile
chattox
brood
who
are
all
my
natural
enemies
but
no
matter
i
shall
have
my
revenge
the
men
having
promised
compliance
with
their
captain
command
he
went
on
as
to
myself
he
said
i
shall
go
forthwith
and
as
fast
as
my
horse
can
carry
me
to
malkin
tower
and
i
will
tell
you
why
it
is
not
that
i
dislike
the
game
we
are
upon
but
i
have
better
to
play
just
now
tom
shaw
the
at
downham
who
is
in
my
pay
rode
over
to
whalley
this
afternoon
to
bring
me
word
that
a
certain
lady
who
has
long
been
concealed
in
the
will
be
taken
to
malkin
tower
the
intelligence
is
certain
for
he
had
obtained
it
from
old
crouch
the
huntsman
who
is
to
escort
her
thus
mistress
nutter
for
you
all
know
whom
i
mean
will
fall
naturally
into
our
hands
and
we
can
wring
any
sums
of
money
we
like
out
of
her
for
though
she
has
abandoned
her
property
to
her
daughter
alizon
she
can
no
doubt
have
as
much
as
she
wants
and
i
will
take
care
she
asks
for
plenty
or
i
will
try
the
effect
of
some
of
those
instruments
of
torture
which
i
was
lucky
enough
to
find
in
the
dungeons
of
malkin
tower
and
which
were
used
for
a
like
purpose
by
my
predecessor
blackburn
the
freebooter
are
you
content
my
lads
ay
ay
captain
demdike
they
replied
upon
this
the
whole
party
set
forward
and
were
speedily
out
of
hearing
as
soon
as
they
thought
it
prudent
to
come
forth
the
squire
and
nance
emerged
from
their
place
of
shelter
what
is
to
be
done
exclaimed
the
former
who
was
almost
in
a
state
of
distraction
the
villain
has
announced
his
intention
of
going
to
malkin
tower
and
mistress
nutter
will
assuredly
fall
into
his
hands
oh
that
i
could
stop
him
or
get
there
before
him
yo
shan
if
yo
like
to
ride
wi
me
said
nance
but
how
in
what
way
asked
nicholas
leave
that
to
me
replied
nance
breaking
off
a
long
branch
of
hazel
tak
howld
o
this
she
cried
the
squire
obeyed
and
was
instantly
carried
off
his
legs
and
whisked
through
the
air
at
a
prodigious
rate
he
felt
giddy
and
confused
but
did
not
dare
to
leave
go
lest
he
should
be
dashed
in
pieces
while
nance
wild
laughter
rang
in
his
ears
over
the
bleached
and
perpendicular
crag
startling
the
eagle
from
his
eyry
over
the
yawning
gully
with
the
torrent
roaring
beneath
him
over
the
sharp
ridges
of
the
hill
over
townley
park
over
burnley
steeple
over
the
wide
valley
beyond
he
went
until
at
last
bewildered
out
of
breath
and
like
one
in
a
dream
he
alighted
on
a
brown
bare
heathy
expanse
and
within
a
hundred
yards
of
a
tall
circular
stone
structure
which
he
knew
to
be
malkin
tower
chapter
the
end
of
malkin
tower
the
shades
of
night
had
fallen
on
downham
and
with
an
aching
heart
and
a
strong
presentiment
of
ill
mistress
nutter
prepared
to
quit
the
little
chamber
which
had
sheltered
her
for
more
than
two
months
and
where
she
would
willingly
have
breathed
her
latest
sigh
if
it
had
been
so
permitted
her
closing
the
bible
she
had
been
reading
she
placed
the
sacred
volume
under
her
arm
and
taking
up
a
small
bundle
containing
her
slender
preparations
for
travel
extinguished
the
taper
and
then
descending
by
a
secret
staircase
passed
through
a
door
fashioned
externally
like
a
cupboard
and
entered
a
where
she
found
old
crouch
awaiting
her
a
few
whispered
words
only
passed
between
her
and
the
huntsman
and
informing
her
that
the
horses
were
in
waiting
at
the
back
of
the
garden
he
took
the
bundle
from
her
and
would
fain
have
relieved
her
also
of
the
bible
but
she
would
not
part
with
it
and
pressing
it
more
closely
to
her
bosom
said
she
was
quite
ready
to
attend
him
it
was
a
beautiful
starlight
night
the
air
soft
and
balmy
and
laden
with
the
perfume
of
the
flowers
a
nightingale
was
singing
plaintively
in
an
adjoining
tree
and
presently
came
a
response
equally
tender
from
another
part
of
the
grove
mistress
nutter
could
not
choose
but
listen
and
the
melody
so
touched
her
that
she
was
half
suffocated
by
repressed
emotion
for
alas
the
relief
of
tears
was
denied
her
motioning
her
somewhat
impatiently
to
come
on
crouch
struck
into
a
sombre
alley
edged
by
clipped
and
terminating
in
a
plantation
through
which
a
winding
path
led
to
the
foot
of
the
hill
whereon
the
mansion
was
situated
by
daylight
this
was
a
beautiful
walk
affording
exquisite
glimpses
through
the
trees
of
the
surrounding
scenery
and
commanding
a
noble
view
of
pendle
hill
the
dominant
point
in
the
prospect
but
even
now
to
the
poor
lady
so
long
immured
in
her
chamber
and
deprived
of
many
of
nature
choicest
blessings
it
appeared
delightful
the
fresh
air
redolent
of
hay
fanned
her
pale
cheek
and
feverish
brow
and
allayed
her
agitation
and
excitement
the
perfect
stillness
broken
only
by
the
lowing
of
the
cattle
in
the
adjoining
pastures
by
the
drowsy
hum
of
the
or
the
rippling
of
the
beck
in
the
valley
further
calmed
her
and
the
soothing
influence
was
completed
by
a
contemplation
of
the
serene
heavens
wherein
were
seen
the
starry
host
with
the
thin
bright
crescent
of
the
new
moon
in
the
midst
of
them
diffusing
a
pearly
light
around
her
one
blot
alone
appeared
in
the
otherwise
smiling
sky
and
this
was
a
great
ugly
black
cloud
lowering
over
the
summit
of
pendle
hill
mistress
nutter
noticed
the
portentous
cloud
and
noticed
also
its
shadow
on
the
hill
which
might
have
been
cast
by
the
fiend
himself
so
like
was
it
to
a
demoniacal
shape
with
outstretched
wings
but
though
shuddering
at
the
idea
it
suggested
she
would
not
suffer
it
to
obtain
possession
of
her
mind
but
resolutely
fixed
her
attention
on
other
and
more
pleasing
objects
by
this
time
they
had
reached
the
foot
of
the
hill
and
a
gate
admitted
them
to
a
road
running
by
the
side
of
downham
beck
here
they
found
the
horses
in
charge
of
a
man
in
the
dark
red
livery
of
nicholas
assheton
and
who
was
no
other
than
tom
shaw
the
rascally
delivering
the
bridles
to
crouch
the
knave
hastily
strode
away
but
he
lingered
at
a
little
distance
to
see
the
lady
mount
and
then
leaping
the
hedge
struck
through
the
plantation
towards
the
hall
chinking
the
money
in
his
pockets
as
he
went
and
thinking
how
cleverly
he
had
earned
it
but
he
did
not
go
unpunished
for
it
is
a
satisfaction
to
record
that
in
walking
through
the
woods
he
was
caught
in
a
gin
placed
there
by
crouch
which
held
him
fast
in
its
iron
teeth
till
morning
when
he
was
discovered
by
one
of
the
while
going
his
rounds
in
a
deplorable
condition
and
lamed
for
life
meanwhile
unconscious
either
of
the
manner
in
which
she
had
been
betrayed
or
of
the
punishment
awaiting
her
betrayer
mistress
nutter
followed
her
conductor
in
silence
for
a
while
the
road
continued
by
the
side
of
the
brook
and
then
quitting
it
commenced
a
long
and
tedious
ascent
running
between
high
banks
fringed
with
trees
the
overhanging
boughs
rendered
it
so
dark
that
mistress
nutter
could
scarcely
distinguish
the
old
huntsman
though
he
was
not
many
yards
in
advance
of
her
but
she
heard
the
tramp
of
his
horse
and
that
was
enough
all
at
once
where
the
boughs
were
thickest
and
the
road
darkest
she
perceived
a
small
fiery
object
on
the
bank
and
in
her
alarm
called
out
to
the
huntsman
who
looking
back
for
a
moment
laughed
and
told
her
not
to
be
uneasy
for
it
was
only
a
ashamed
of
her
idle
fears
she
rode
on
but
had
not
proceeded
far
when
looking
again
at
the
bank
she
saw
it
studded
with
the
same
lights
this
time
she
did
not
call
out
or
scream
but
gazed
steadily
at
the
twinkling
fires
hoping
to
get
the
better
of
her
fears
her
alarm
however
rose
to
absolute
terror
as
she
beheld
the
if
they
were
twist
together
and
form
themselves
into
a
flaming
brand
such
as
she
had
seen
in
her
vision
grasped
by
the
angel
who
had
driven
her
from
the
gates
of
paradise
averting
her
gaze
she
would
have
hastened
on
but
a
hand
suddenly
laid
upon
her
bridle
held
back
her
horse
and
she
then
perceived
a
tall
dark
man
mounted
on
a
sable
steed
riding
beside
her
the
supernatural
character
of
the
horseman
was
manifest
inasmuch
as
no
sound
was
caused
by
the
tread
of
his
steed
nor
did
he
appear
to
be
visible
to
crouch
when
the
latter
looked
back
mistress
nutter
maintained
her
seat
with
difficulty
she
well
knew
who
was
her
companion
soh
alice
nutter
said
the
horseman
at
length
in
a
low
deep
tone
you
have
chosen
to
shut
yourself
up
in
a
narrow
cell
like
a
recluse
for
more
than
two
months
denying
yourself
all
sort
of
enjoyment
practising
severest
abstinence
and
passing
your
whole
time
in
useless
prayer
ay
useless
for
if
you
were
to
pray
from
now
till
doomsday
come
when
it
will
a
thousand
years
hence
or
it
will
not
save
you
when
you
signed
that
bond
to
my
master
sentence
was
recorded
against
you
and
no
power
can
recall
it
why
then
these
unavailing
lamentations
why
utter
prayers
which
are
rejected
and
supplications
which
are
scorned
shake
off
this
weakness
alice
and
be
yourself
again
once
you
had
pride
enough
and
a
little
of
it
would
now
be
of
service
to
you
you
would
then
see
the
folly
of
this
abject
conduct
humbling
yourself
to
the
dust
only
to
be
spurned
and
suing
for
mercy
only
to
be
derided
pray
as
loud
and
as
long
as
you
will
the
ears
of
heaven
will
remain
ever
deaf
to
you
i
hope
otherwise
rejoined
the
lady
meekly
do
not
deceive
yourself
replied
the
horseman
the
term
granted
you
by
your
compact
will
not
be
abridged
but
it
is
your
own
fault
if
it
be
not
extended
your
daughter
is
destroying
herself
in
the
vain
hope
of
saving
you
her
prayers
are
unavailing
as
your
own
and
recoil
from
the
judgment
throne
unheard
the
youth
upon
whom
her
affections
are
fixed
is
stricken
with
a
deadly
ailment
it
is
in
your
power
to
save
them
both
mistress
nutter
groaned
deeply
it
is
in
your
power
i
say
to
save
them
continued
the
horseman
by
returning
to
your
allegiance
to
your
master
he
will
forgive
your
disobedience
if
you
prove
yourself
zealous
in
his
service
will
restore
you
to
your
former
worldly
position
avenge
you
of
your
enemies
and
accomplish
all
you
may
desire
with
respect
to
your
daughter
he
can
not
do
it
replied
mistress
nutter
can
not
echoed
the
horseman
try
him
for
many
years
i
have
served
you
as
familiar
and
you
have
never
set
me
the
task
i
have
failed
to
execute
i
am
ready
to
become
your
servant
again
and
to
offer
you
a
yet
larger
range
of
control
put
no
limits
to
your
desires
or
ambition
if
you
are
tired
of
this
narrow
sphere
take
a
wider
look
abroad
but
do
not
shut
yourself
up
in
a
narrow
cell
and
persuade
yourself
you
are
accomplishing
your
ultimate
deliverance
when
you
are
only
wasting
precious
time
which
might
be
more
advantageously
and
far
more
agreeably
employed
while
laughing
at
your
folly
my
master
deplores
it
and
he
has
therefore
sent
me
as
to
one
for
whom
notwithstanding
all
derelictions
from
duty
he
has
still
a
regard
with
an
offer
of
full
forgiveness
provided
you
return
to
him
at
once
and
renew
your
covenant
proving
your
sincerity
by
casting
from
you
the
book
you
hold
under
your
arm
your
snares
are
not
laid
subtle
enough
to
catch
me
replied
mistress
nutter
i
will
never
part
with
this
holy
volume
which
is
my
present
safeguard
and
on
which
i
build
my
hopes
of
salvation
hopes
which
your
very
proposals
have
revived
in
my
breast
for
i
am
well
assured
your
master
would
not
make
them
if
he
felt
confident
of
his
power
over
me
no
i
defy
him
and
you
and
i
command
you
in
heaven
name
to
get
hence
and
to
tempt
me
no
longer
as
the
words
were
uttered
with
a
howl
of
rage
and
mortification
like
the
roar
of
a
wild
beast
the
dark
horseman
and
his
steed
vanished
alarmed
by
the
sound
crouch
stopped
and
questioned
the
lady
as
to
its
cause
but
receiving
no
satisfactory
explanation
from
her
he
bade
her
ride
quickly
on
affirming
it
must
be
the
boggart
of
the
clough
soon
after
this
they
again
came
upon
downham
beck
and
were
about
to
cross
it
when
their
purpose
was
arrested
by
a
joyous
barking
and
the
next
moment
grip
came
up
the
dog
it
appeared
had
been
shut
up
in
the
stable
his
company
not
being
desired
on
the
expedition
but
contriving
in
some
way
or
other
to
get
out
he
had
scented
his
master
course
and
in
the
end
overtaken
him
crouch
did
not
know
whether
to
be
angry
or
pleased
and
at
first
gave
utterance
to
an
oath
and
raised
his
whip
to
chastise
him
but
almost
instantly
the
latter
feeling
predominated
and
he
welcomed
the
faithful
animal
with
a
few
kind
words
ey
suppose
theaw
thowt
ey
couldna
do
without
thee
grip
he
said
and
mayhap
reet
they
are
now
across
the
beck
and
speeding
over
the
wide
brown
waste
the
huntsman
warily
shapes
his
course
so
as
to
avoid
any
or
he
points
out
a
dancing
merrily
on
the
surface
of
a
dangerous
morass
and
tells
a
dismal
tale
of
a
traveller
lured
into
it
by
the
delusive
light
and
swallowed
up
mistress
nutter
pays
little
heed
to
him
but
ever
and
anon
looks
back
as
if
in
dread
of
some
one
behind
her
but
no
one
is
visible
and
she
only
sees
the
great
black
cloud
still
hovering
over
pendle
hill
on
on
they
go
their
horses
hoofs
now
splashing
through
the
wet
sod
now
beating
upon
the
firm
but
elastic
turf
a
merry
ride
it
would
be
if
their
errand
were
different
and
their
hearts
free
from
care
the
air
is
fresh
and
reviving
and
the
rapid
motion
exhilarating
the
stars
shine
out
and
the
crescent
moon
is
still
glittering
in
the
heavens
but
the
black
cloud
hangs
motionless
on
pendle
hill
now
and
then
some
bird
of
night
flies
past
them
and
they
hear
the
whooping
of
the
owl
and
see
him
skimming
like
a
ghost
over
the
waste
then
more
fen
fires
arise
showing
that
other
treacherous
quagmires
are
at
hand
but
crouch
skirts
them
safely
now
the
croaks
in
the
marsh
and
a
deep
booming
tells
of
a
bittern
passing
by
they
see
the
mighty
bird
above
them
with
his
wide
heavy
wings
and
long
neck
grip
howls
at
him
but
is
instantly
checked
by
his
master
and
they
gallop
on
they
are
now
by
the
side
of
pendle
water
and
within
sight
of
rough
lee
what
tumultuous
thoughts
agitate
the
lady
breast
the
ground
she
tramples
on
was
once
her
own
the
woods
by
the
river
side
were
planted
by
her
the
mansion
before
her
once
owned
her
as
mistress
and
now
she
dares
not
approach
it
nor
does
she
desire
to
do
so
for
the
sight
of
it
brings
back
terrible
recollections
and
fills
her
again
with
despair
they
are
now
close
upon
it
and
it
appears
dark
silent
and
deserted
how
different
from
what
it
was
of
yore
in
her
husband
days
the
husband
she
had
foully
slain
speed
on
old
huntsman
lash
your
panting
horse
or
the
remorseful
lady
will
far
outstrip
you
for
she
rides
as
if
the
avenging
furies
were
at
her
heels
she
is
rattling
over
the
bridge
and
crouch
toiling
after
her
and
with
grip
toiling
after
him
shouts
to
her
to
moderate
her
pace
she
looks
back
and
beholds
the
grim
old
house
frowning
full
upon
her
and
hurries
on
huntsman
and
dog
are
left
behind
for
awhile
but
the
steep
ascent
soon
compels
her
to
slacken
speed
and
they
come
up
crouch
swearing
lustily
and
grip
with
his
tongue
out
of
his
mouth
limping
as
if
the
road
now
leads
through
a
thicket
the
horses
stumble
frequently
for
the
stones
are
loose
and
the
footing
consequently
uncertain
crouch
has
a
fall
and
ere
he
can
remount
the
lady
is
gone
it
is
useless
to
hurry
after
her
and
he
is
proceeding
slowly
when
grip
who
is
a
little
in
advance
growls
fiercely
and
looks
back
at
his
master
as
if
to
intimate
that
danger
is
at
hand
the
huntsman
presses
on
but
he
is
too
late
if
indeed
he
could
at
any
time
have
rendered
effectual
assistance
a
clearing
in
the
thicket
shows
him
the
lady
dismounted
and
surrounded
by
several
men
armed
with
calivers
part
of
the
band
bear
her
shrieking
off
and
the
rest
fire
at
him
but
without
effect
and
then
chase
him
as
far
as
the
steepest
part
of
the
hill
down
which
he
dashes
followed
by
grip
arrived
at
the
bottom
he
pauses
to
listen
if
he
is
pursued
and
hearing
nothing
further
to
alarm
him
debates
with
himself
what
is
best
to
be
done
and
not
liking
to
alarm
the
village
for
that
would
be
to
betray
mistress
nutter
he
gets
off
his
horse
ties
him
to
a
tree
and
with
grip
close
at
his
heels
commences
the
ascent
of
the
hill
by
a
different
road
from
that
he
had
previously
taken
meanwhile
mistress
nutter
captors
dragged
her
forcibly
towards
the
tower
their
arms
and
appearance
left
her
no
doubt
they
were
depredators
and
she
sought
to
convince
them
she
had
neither
money
nor
valuables
in
her
possession
they
laughed
at
her
assertions
but
made
no
other
reply
her
sole
consolation
was
that
they
did
not
seek
to
deprive
her
of
her
bible
on
reaching
the
tower
a
signal
was
given
by
one
of
the
foremost
of
the
band
and
the
steps
being
lowered
from
the
high
doorway
she
was
compelled
to
ascend
them
and
being
pushed
along
a
short
passage
obscured
by
a
piece
of
thick
tapestry
but
which
was
drawn
aside
as
she
advanced
she
found
herself
in
a
circular
chamber
in
the
midst
of
which
was
a
massive
table
covered
with
flasks
and
and
stained
with
wine
from
the
roof
which
was
crossed
by
great
black
beams
of
oak
was
suspended
a
lamp
with
three
burners
whose
light
showed
that
the
walls
were
garnished
with
petronels
rapiers
poniards
and
other
murderous
weapons
besides
these
there
were
hung
from
pegs
long
sombreros
vizards
and
other
robber
accoutrements
including
a
variety
of
disguises
from
the
clown
frieze
jerkin
to
the
gentleman
velvet
doublet
ready
to
be
assumed
on
an
emergency
here
and
there
was
an
open
valise
or
a
pair
of
with
their
contents
strewn
about
the
floor
and
on
a
bench
were
a
and
showing
with
the
flasks
and
goblets
on
the
table
how
the
occupants
of
the
tower
passed
their
time
a
steep
flight
of
steps
led
to
the
upper
chamber
and
down
these
at
the
very
moment
of
mistress
nutter
entrance
descended
a
stalwart
personage
who
eyed
her
fiercely
as
he
leapt
upon
the
floor
there
was
something
in
the
man
truculent
physiognomy
and
strange
and
oblique
vision
that
reminded
her
of
mother
demdike
welcome
to
malkin
tower
madam
said
the
robber
with
a
grin
and
doffing
his
cap
with
affected
courtesy
we
have
met
before
but
it
is
many
years
ago
and
i
dare
say
you
have
forgotten
me
you
will
guess
who
i
am
when
i
tell
you
my
mother
occupied
this
tower
before
me
finding
mistress
nutter
made
no
remark
he
went
on
i
am
christopher
demdike
madam
captain
demdike
i
should
say
the
brave
fellows
who
have
brought
you
hither
are
part
of
my
band
and
till
lately
northumberland
and
the
borders
of
scotland
used
to
be
our
scene
of
action
but
chancing
to
hear
of
my
worthy
old
mother
death
i
thought
we
could
not
do
better
than
take
possession
of
her
stronghold
which
devolved
upon
me
by
right
of
inheritance
since
our
arrival
here
we
have
kept
ourselves
very
quiet
and
the
country
folk
taking
us
for
spirits
or
demons
never
approach
our
while
as
all
our
depredations
are
confined
to
distant
parts
our
retreat
has
never
been
suspected
this
concerns
me
little
observed
mistress
nutter
coldly
pardon
me
madam
it
concerns
you
much
as
you
will
learn
anon
but
be
seated
i
pray
you
he
said
with
mock
civility
i
am
keeping
you
standing
all
this
while
but
as
the
lady
declined
the
attention
he
went
on
i
was
fortunate
enough
on
first
coming
back
to
this
part
of
the
country
to
pick
up
an
acquaintance
with
your
relative
nicholas
assheton
who
invited
me
to
stay
with
him
at
downham
and
was
so
well
pleased
with
my
society
that
he
could
not
endure
to
part
with
me
indeed
exclaimed
mistress
nutter
are
you
the
person
he
called
lawrence
fogg
the
same
replied
demdike
and
no
doubt
you
would
hear
a
good
report
of
me
madam
well
it
suited
my
purpose
to
stay
for
i
was
very
hospitably
entertained
by
the
squire
who
except
being
rather
too
much
addicted
to
lectures
and
is
as
pleasant
a
host
as
one
could
desire
besides
which
he
was
obliging
enough
to
employ
me
to
borrow
money
for
him
and
what
i
got
i
kept
you
may
be
sure
i
would
willingly
be
spared
the
details
of
your
knavery
said
mistress
nutter
somewhat
impatiently
i
am
coming
to
an
end
rejoined
demdike
and
then
perhaps
you
may
wish
i
had
prolonged
them
all
the
squire
secrets
were
committed
to
me
and
i
was
fully
aware
of
your
concealment
in
the
hall
but
i
could
never
ascertain
precisely
where
you
were
lodged
i
meant
to
carry
you
off
and
only
awaited
the
opportunity
which
has
presented
itself
if
you
think
to
obtain
money
from
me
you
will
find
yourself
mistaken
said
mistress
nutter
i
have
parted
with
all
my
possessions
but
to
whom
madam
cried
demdike
with
a
sinister
smile
to
your
daughter
and
i
am
sure
she
is
too
gentle
too
to
allow
you
to
suffer
when
she
can
relieve
you
you
must
get
us
a
good
round
sum
from
her
or
you
will
be
detained
here
long
the
dungeons
are
dark
and
unwholesome
and
my
band
are
apt
to
be
harsh
in
their
treatment
of
captives
they
have
found
in
the
vaults
some
instruments
of
torture
belonging
to
old
blackburn
the
freebooter
the
efficacy
of
which
in
an
obstinate
case
i
fear
they
might
be
inclined
to
try
you
now
begin
to
see
the
drift
of
my
discourse
madam
and
understand
the
sort
of
men
you
have
to
deal
with
barbarous
fellows
madam
inhuman
dogs
and
he
laughed
coarsely
at
his
own
jocularity
it
may
put
an
end
to
this
discussion
said
mistress
nutter
firmly
if
i
declare
that
no
torture
shall
induce
me
to
make
any
such
demand
from
my
daughter
you
think
perhaps
i
am
jesting
with
you
madam
rejoined
demdike
oh
no
i
believe
you
capable
of
any
atrocity
replied
the
lady
you
do
not
either
in
feature
or
deeds
belie
your
parentage
ah
say
you
so
madam
cried
demdike
you
have
a
sharp
tongue
i
find
courtesy
is
thrown
away
upon
you
what
ho
lads
kenyon
and
lowton
take
the
lady
down
to
the
vaults
and
there
let
her
have
an
hour
for
solitary
reflection
she
may
change
her
mind
in
that
time
do
not
think
it
cried
mistress
nutter
resolutely
if
you
continue
obstinate
we
will
find
means
to
move
you
rejoined
demdike
in
a
taunting
tone
but
what
has
she
got
beneath
her
arm
give
me
the
book
what
this
a
bible
a
witch
with
a
bible
it
should
be
a
grimoire
ha
ha
give
it
me
back
i
implore
of
you
shrieked
the
lady
i
shall
be
destroyed
soul
and
body
if
i
have
it
not
with
me
what
you
are
afraid
the
devil
may
carry
you
off
without
it
ho
ho
roared
demdike
well
that
would
not
suit
my
purpose
at
present
here
take
it
and
now
off
with
her
lads
without
more
ado
and
as
he
spoke
a
trapdoor
was
opened
by
one
of
the
robbers
disclosing
a
flight
of
steps
leading
to
the
subterranean
chambers
down
which
the
miserable
lady
was
dragged
presently
the
two
men
with
a
grim
smile
on
their
ruffianly
countenances
and
as
they
closed
the
trapdoor
one
of
them
observed
to
the
captain
that
they
had
chained
her
to
a
pillar
by
removing
the
band
from
the
great
skeleton
and
passing
it
round
her
body
you
have
done
well
lads
replied
demdike
approvingly
and
now
go
all
of
you
and
scour
the
and
return
in
an
hour
and
we
will
decide
upon
what
is
to
be
done
with
this
woman
the
two
men
then
joined
the
rest
of
their
comrades
outside
and
the
whole
troop
descended
the
steps
which
were
afterwards
drawn
up
by
demdike
this
done
the
robber
captain
returned
to
the
circular
chamber
and
for
some
time
paced
to
and
fro
revolving
his
dark
schemes
he
then
paused
and
placing
his
ear
near
the
trapdoor
listened
but
as
no
sound
reached
him
he
sat
down
at
the
table
and
soon
grew
so
much
absorbed
as
to
be
unconscious
that
a
dark
figure
was
creeping
stealthily
down
the
narrow
staircase
behind
him
i
can
not
get
rid
of
nicholas
assheton
he
exclaimed
at
length
i
somehow
fancy
we
shall
meet
again
and
yet
all
should
be
over
with
him
by
this
time
look
round
thundered
a
voice
behind
him
nicholas
assheton
is
not
to
be
got
rid
of
so
easily
at
this
unexpected
summons
demdike
started
to
his
feet
and
recoiled
aghast
as
he
saw
what
he
took
to
be
the
ghost
of
the
murdered
squire
standing
before
him
a
second
look
however
convinced
him
that
it
was
no
phantom
he
beheld
but
a
living
man
armed
for
vengeance
and
determined
upon
it
get
a
weapon
villain
cried
nicholas
in
tones
of
concentrated
fury
i
do
not
wish
to
take
unfair
advantage
even
of
thee
without
a
word
of
reply
demdike
snatched
a
sword
from
the
wall
and
the
next
moment
was
engaged
in
deadly
strife
with
the
squire
they
were
well
matched
for
both
were
powerful
men
both
expert
in
the
use
of
their
weapons
and
the
combat
might
have
been
protracted
and
of
doubtful
issue
but
for
the
irresistible
fury
of
nicholas
who
assaulted
his
adversary
with
such
vigour
and
determination
that
he
speedily
drove
him
against
the
wall
where
the
latter
made
an
attempt
to
seize
a
petronel
hanging
beside
him
but
his
purpose
being
divined
he
received
a
thrust
through
the
arm
and
dropping
his
blade
lay
at
the
squire
mercy
nicholas
shortened
his
sword
but
forbore
to
strike
seizing
his
enemy
by
the
throat
he
hurled
him
to
the
ground
and
planting
his
knee
on
his
chest
called
out
what
ho
nance
nance
exclaimed
demdike
then
it
was
that
mischievous
jade
who
brought
you
here
ay
replied
the
squire
as
the
young
woman
came
quickly
down
the
steps
and
i
refused
her
aid
in
the
conflict
because
i
felt
certain
of
mastering
thee
and
because
i
would
not
take
odds
even
against
such
a
treacherous
villain
as
thou
art
better
dispatch
him
squire
said
nance
he
may
do
yo
a
mischief
yet
no
no
replied
nicholas
he
is
unworthy
of
a
gentleman
sword
besides
i
have
sworn
to
hang
him
and
i
will
keep
my
word
go
down
into
the
vaults
and
liberate
mistress
nutter
while
i
bind
him
for
we
must
take
him
with
us
he
shall
lie
in
lancaster
castle
with
his
kinsfolk
that
remains
to
be
seen
muttered
demdike
be
on
your
guard
squire
cried
nance
as
she
lifted
a
small
lamp
and
raised
the
trapdoor
with
this
caution
she
descended
to
the
vaults
while
nicholas
looked
about
for
a
thong
and
perceiving
a
rope
dangling
down
the
wall
near
him
he
seized
it
drawing
it
with
some
force
towards
him
a
sudden
sound
reached
his
ears
clang
clang
he
had
rung
the
violently
clang
clang
clang
would
it
never
stop
taking
advantage
of
his
surprise
and
consternation
demdike
got
from
under
him
sprang
to
his
feet
and
rushing
to
the
doorway
instantly
let
fall
the
steps
roaring
out
treason
to
the
rescue
my
men
to
the
rescue
his
cries
were
immediately
answered
from
without
and
it
was
evident
from
the
tumult
that
the
whole
of
the
band
were
hurrying
to
his
assistance
not
a
moment
was
to
be
lost
by
the
squire
plunging
through
the
trapdoor
he
closed
it
after
him
and
bolted
it
underneath
at
the
very
moment
the
robbers
entered
the
chamber
demdike
rage
at
finding
him
gone
was
increased
when
all
the
combined
efforts
of
his
men
failed
in
forcing
open
the
trapdoor
take
hatchets
and
hew
it
open
he
cried
we
must
have
them
i
have
heard
there
is
a
secret
outlet
below
and
though
i
have
never
been
able
to
discover
it
it
may
be
known
to
nance
i
will
go
outside
and
watch
if
you
hear
me
whistle
come
forth
instantly
and
rushing
forth
he
was
making
the
circuit
of
the
tower
and
examining
some
bushes
at
its
base
when
his
throat
was
suddenly
seized
by
a
dog
and
before
he
could
even
utter
an
exclamation
much
less
sound
his
whistle
or
use
his
arms
he
was
grappled
by
the
old
huntsman
and
dragged
off
to
a
considerable
distance
the
dog
still
clinging
to
his
throat
meanwhile
nicholas
had
hurried
down
into
the
vaults
where
he
found
nance
sustaining
mistress
nutter
who
was
half
fainting
and
hastily
explaining
what
had
occurred
she
consigned
the
lady
to
him
and
then
led
the
way
through
the
central
range
of
pillars
and
past
the
ebon
image
until
she
approached
the
wall
when
holding
up
the
lamp
she
revealed
a
black
marble
slab
between
the
statues
of
blackburn
and
isole
pressing
against
it
the
slab
moved
on
one
side
and
disclosed
a
flight

steps

when

did
not
very
clearly

but
concluding
nance
had
some
hidden
meaning
in
what
she
said
he
resolved
unhesitatingly
to
obey
her
having
got
clear
of
the
tower
as
directed
with
mistress
nutter
he
ran
on
with
her
to
some
distance
when

was
his
surprise
to
find

and
grip
keeping
watch
over
the
prostrate
robber
chief
a
few
words
from
the
huntsman
sufficed
to
explain
how
this
had
come
about
but
they
were
scarcely
uttered
when
nance
rushed
up
in
breathless
haste
crying

and
bore
him
away
between
them
while
nance
assisted

nutter
along
they
had
not
gone
far
when
a
rumbling
sound
like
that
preceding
an
earthquake
was
heard
all
looked
back
towards
malkin
tower
the
structure
was
seen
to
rock
flames
burst
from
the
earth
and
with
a
tremendous
explosion
heard
for
miles

and
which
shook
the
ground
even
where
nicholas
and
the
others
stood
the
whole
of
the
unhallowed
fabric
from
base
to
summit
was
blown
into
the
air
some
of
the
stones
being
projected
to
an
extraordinary
distance
a
mine
charged
with
gunpowder
it
appeared
had
been
laid
beneath
its
vaults
by
demdike
with
a
view
to
its
destruction
at
some
future
period
and

circumstance
being
known
to

had
fired

chapter
hoghton
tower
about
a
month
after
the
occurrence
last
described
and
early
on
a
fine
morning
in
august
nicholas
assheton
and
richard
sherborne
rode
forth
together
from
the
proud
town
of
preston
both
were
gaily
attired
in
doublets
and
hose
of
yellow
velvet
slashed
with
white
silk
with
mantles
to
match
the
latter
being
somewhat
conspicuously
embroidered
on
the
shoulder
with
a
wild
bull
worked
in
gold
and
underneath
it
the
motto
le
followed
at
a
respectful
distance
by
four
mounted
attendants
the
two
gentlemen
had
crossed
the
bridge
over
the
ribble
and
were
wending
their
way
along
the
banks
of
a
tributary
stream
the
darwen
within
a
short
distance
of
the
charming
village
of
when
they
perceived
a
horseman
advancing
slowly
towards
them
whom
they
instantly
hailed
as
richard
assheton
and
pushing
forward
were
soon
beside
him
both
were
much
shocked
by
the
young
haggard
looks
and
inquired
anxiously
as
to
his
health
but
richard
bade
them
with
a
melancholy
smile
not
be
uneasy
for
all
would
be
well
with
him
erelong
all
will
be
over
with
you
lad
if
you
do
mind
and
that
perhaps
what
you
mean
replied
nicholas
but
as
soon
as
the
royal
festivities
at
hoghton
are
over
i
set
about
your
cure
and
what
more
accomplish
it
for
i
know
where
the
seat
of
the
disease
lies
better
than
morphew
your
family
physician
at
middleton
is
near
the
heart
dick
near
the
heart
ha
i
see
i
have
touched
you
lad
but
beshrew
me
you
are
very
strangely
attired
in
a
suit
of
sable
velvet
with
a
black
spanish
hat
and
feather
for
a
festival
you
look
as
if
going
to
a
funeral
i
am
fearful
his
majesty
may
take
it
amiss
why
not
wear
the
livery
of
our
house
nay
if
it
comes
to
that
rejoined
richard
why
do
not
you
and
sherborne
wear
it
instead
of
flaunting
like
daws
in
borrowed
plumage
i
scarce
know
you
in
your
strange
garb
and
certainly
should
not
take
you
for
an
assheton
or
aught
pertaining
to
our
family
from
your
gaudy
colours
and
the
strange
badge
on
your
shoulder
i
do
wonder
at
it
dick
said
nicholas
i
scarce
know
myself
and
though
the
clothes
i
wear
are
well
made
enough
they
seem
to
sit
awkwardly
on
me
and
trouble
me
as
much
as
the
shirt
of
nessus
did
hercules
of
old
for
the
nonce
i
am
sir
richard
hoghton
retainer
i
must
own
i
was
angry
with
myself
when
i
saw
sir
ralph
assheton
with
his
long
train
of
gentlemen
all
in
cloaks
and
doublets
at
myerscough
lodge
while
i
his
cousin
was
habited
like
one
of
another
house
and
when
i
would
have
excused
my
apparent
defection
to
sir
ralph
he
answered
coldly
was
better
as
it
was
for
he
could
scarcely
have
found
room
for
me
among
his
friends
do
not
fret
yourself
nicholas
rejoined
sherborne
sir
ralph
can
not
reasonably
take
offence
at
a
mere
piece
of
on
your
part
but
this
does
not
explain
why
richard
affects
a
colour
so
sombre
i
am
the
retainer
of
one
whose
livery
is
sombre
replied
the
young
man
with
a
ghastly
smile
but
enough
of
this
he
added
endeavouring
to
assume
a
livelier
air
i
suppose
you
are
on
the
way
to
hoghton
tower
i
thought
to
reach
preston
before
you
were
up
but
i
might
have
recollected
you
are
no
nicholas
not
even
after
hard
drinking
overnight
as
witness
your
feats
at
whalley
to
be
frank
with
you
i
feared
being
led
into
like
excesses
and
so
preferred
passing
the
night
at
the
quiet
little
inn
at
to
coming
on
to
you
at
the
castle
at
preston
which
i
knew
would
be
full
of
noisy
roysterers
full
it
was
even
to
overflowing
replied
the
squire
but
you
should
have
come
dick
for
by
my
troth
we
had
a
right
merry
night
of
it
stephen
hamerton
of
hellyfield
peel
with
his
wife
and
her
sister
sweet
mistress
doll
lister
supped
with
us
and
we
had
music
dancing
and
singing
and
abundance
of
good
cheer
nouns
dick
doll
lister
is
a
delightful
lass
and
if
you
can
only
get
alizon
out
of
your
head
would
be
just
the
wife
for
you
she
sings
like
an
angel
has
the
most
captivating
manner
and
the
prettiest
rounded
figure
ever
bodice
kept
in
were
i
in
your
place
i
should
know
where
to
choose
but
you
will
see
her
at
hoghton
for
she
is
to
be
at
the
banquet
and
masque
your
description
does
not
tempt
me
said
richard
i
have
no
taste
for
damsels
dorothy
lister
however
is
accounted
fair
enough
but
were
she
fascinating
as
venus
herself
in
my
present
mood
i
should
not
regard
her
i
faith
lad
i
pity
you
if
such
be
the
case
shrugging
his
shoulders
more
in
contempt
than
compassion
waste
not
your
sympathy
upon
me
replied
richard
but
tell
me
how
went
the
show
at
preston
yesterday
excellently
well
and
much
to
his
majesty
satisfaction
answered
the
squire
proud
preston
never
was
so
proud
before
and
never
with
such
good
reason
for
if
the
people
be
poor
according
to
the
proverb
they
take
good
care
to
hide
their
poverty
bombards
were
fired
from
the
bridge
and
the
church
bells
rang
loud
enough
to
crack
the
steeple
and
bring
it
down
about
the
ears
of
the
deafened
lieges
the
houses
were
hung
with
carpets
and
arras
the
streets
strewn
ankle
deep
with
sand
and
sawdust
the
cross
in
the
was
bedecked
with
garlands
of
flowers
like
a
and
the
conduit
near
it
ran
wine
at
noon
there
was
more
firing
and
amidst
flourishes
of
trumpets
rolling
of
drums
squeaking
of
fifes
and
prodigious
shouting
bonnie
king
jamie
came
to
the
cross
where
a
speech
was
made
him
by
master
breares
the
recorder
after
which
the
corporation
presented
his
majesty
with
a
huge
silver
bowl
in
token
of
their
love
and
loyalty
the
king
seemed
highly
pleased
with
the
gift
and
observed
to
the
duke
of
buckingham
loud
enough
to
be
heard
by
the
bystanders
who
reported
his
speech
to
me
santie
it
a
braw
bicker
steenie
and
might
serve
for
a
if
we
had
need
of
siccan
a
vessel
which
heaven
be
praised
we
na
after
this
there
was
a
grand
banquet
in
the
and
when
the
heat
of
the
day
was
over
the
king
left
with
his
train
for
hoghton
tower
visiting
the
alum
mines
on
the
way
thither
we
are
bidden
to
breakfast
by
sir
richard
so
we
must
push
on
dick
for
his
majesty
is
an
early
riser
like
myself
we
are
to
have
rare
sport
hunting
in
the
morning
a
banquet
and
as
i
have
already
intimated
a
masque
at
night
in
which
sir
george
goring
and
sir
john
finett
will
play
and
in
which
i
have
been
solicited
to
take
the
drolling
part
of
jem
tospot
nay
laugh
not
dick
sherborne
says
i
shall
play
it
to
the
life
as
well
as
to
find
some
mirthful
dame
to
enact
the
companion
part
of
doll
wango
i
have
spoken
with
two
or
three
on
the
subject
and
fancy
one
of
them
will
oblige
me
there
is
another
matter
on
which
i
am
engaged
i
am
to
present
a
petition
to
his
majesty
from
a
great
number
of
the
lower
orders
in
this
county
praying
they
may
be
allowed
to
take
their
diversions
as
of
old
accustomed
after
divine
service
on
sundays
and
though
i
am
the
last
man
to
desire
any
violation
of
the
sabbath
being
somewhat
puritanically
inclined
as
they
now
phrase
it
yet
i
can
not
think
any
harm
can
ensue
from
lawful
recreation
and
honest
exercise
still
i
would
any
one
were
chosen
to
present
the
petition
rather
than
myself
have
no
misgivings
on
the
subject
said
richard
but
urge
the
matter
strongly
and
if
you
need
support
i
will
give
you
all
i
can
for
i
feel
we
are
best
observing
the
divine
mandate
by
making
the
sabbath
a
day
of
rest
and
observing
it
cheerfully
and
this
i
apprehend
is
the
substance
of
your
petition
the
whole
sum
and
substance
replied
nicholas
and
i
have
reason
to
believe
his
majesty
wishes
are
in
accordance
with
it
they
are
known
to
be
so
said
sherborne
i
am
glad
to
hear
it
cried
richard
god
save
king
james
the
friend
of
the
people
ay
god
save
king
james
echoed
nicholas
and
if
he
i
grant
this
petition
he
will
prove
himself
their
friend
for
he
will
i
have
all
the
clergy
against
him
and
will
be
preached
against
from
half
the
pulpits
in
the
kingdom
little
harm
will
ensue
if
it
should
be
so
replied
richard
for
he
will
be
cheered
and
protected
by
the
prayers
of
a
grateful
and
happy
people
they
then
rode
on
for
a
few
minutes
in
silence
after
which
richard
inquired
you
had
brave
doings
at
myerscough
lodge
i
suppose
nicholas
ay
marry
had
we
answered
the
squire
and
the
feasting
must
have
cost
ned
tyldesley
a
pretty
penny
besides
the
king
and
his
own
particular
attendants
there
were
some
dozen
noblemen
and
their
followers
including
the
duke
of
buckingham
who
moves
about
like
a
king
himself
and
i
know
not
how
many
knights
and
gentlemen
sherborne
and
i
rode
over
from
dunnow
and
reached
the
forest
immediately
after
the
king
had
entered
it
in
his
coach
so
we
took
a
short
cut
through
the
woods
and
came
up
just
in
time
to
join
sir
richard
hoghton
train
as
he
was
riding
up
to
his
majesty
fancy
a
wide
glade
down
which
a
great
gilded
coach
is
slowly
moving
drawn
by
eight
horses
and
followed
by
a
host
of
noblemen
and
gentlemen
in
splendid
apparel
their
esquires
and
pages
equally
richly
arrayed
and
equally
well
mounted
and
after
these
numerous
falconers
huntsmen
prickers
foresters
and
yeomen
with
staghounds
in
leash
and
hawk
on
fist
all
ready
for
the
sport
fancy
all
this
if
you
can
dick
and
then
conceive
what
a
brave
sight
it
must
have
been
well
as
i
said
we
came
up
in
the
very
nick
of
time
for
presently
the
royal
coach
stopped
and
sir
richard
hoghton
calling
all
his
gentlemen
around
him
and
bidding
us
dismount
and
we
followed
him
and
drew
up
bareheaded
before
the
king
while
sir
richard
pointed
out
to
his
majesty
the
boundaries
of
the
royal
forest
and
told
him
he
would
find
it
as
well
stocked
with
deer
as
any
in
his
kingdom
before
putting
an
end
to
the
conference
the
king
complimented
the
worthy
knight
on
the
gallant
appearance
of
his
train
and
on
learning
we
were
all
gentlemen
graciously
signified
his
pleasure
that
some
of
us
should
be
presented
to
him
amongst
others
i
was
brought
forward
by
sir
richard
and
liking
my
looks
i
suppose
the
king
was
condescending
enough
to
enter
into
conversation
with
me
and
as
his
discourse
chiefly
turned
on
sporting
matters
i
was
at
home
with
him
at
once
and
he
presently
grew
so
familiar
with
me
that
i
almost
forgot
the
presence
in
which
i
stood
however
his
majesty
seemed
in
no
way
offended
by
my
freedom
but
on
the
contrary
clapped
me
on
the
shoulder
and
said
assheton
for
a
country
gentleman
you
and
and
i
shall
be
glad
to
see
more
of
you
while
i
stay
in
these
parts
after
this
the
monarch
mounted
his
horse
and
the
hunting
began
and
a
famous
day
work
we
made
of
it
his
majesty
killing
no
fewer
than
five
fine
bucks
with
his
own
hand
you
are
clearly
on
the
road
to
preferment
nicholas
observed
richard
with
a
smile
you
will
outstrip
buckingham
himself
if
you
go
on
in
this
way
so
i
tell
him
observed
sherborne
laughing
and
by
my
faith
young
sir
gilbert
hoghton
who
owing
to
his
connexion
by
marriage
with
buckingham
is
a
greater
man
than
his
father
sir
richard
looked
quite
jealous
for
the
king
more
than
once
called
out
to
nicholas
in
the
chase
and
took
the
from
him
when
he
broke
up
the
last
deer
which
is
accounted
a
mark
of
especial
favour
well
gentlemen
said
the
squire
i
shall
not
stand
in
my
own
light
depend
upon
it
and
if
i
should
bask
in
you
shall
partake
of
the
rays
if
i
do
become
master
of
the
household
in
lieu
of
the
duke
of
richmond
or
master
of
the
horse
and
cupbearer
to
his
majesty
in
place
of
his
grace
of
buckingham
i
will
not
forget
you
we
are
greatly
indebted
to
you
my
lord
marquess
of
downham
and
duke
of
pendle
hill
that
is
to
be
rejoined
sherborne
taking
off
his
cap
with
mock
reverence
and
perhaps
for
the
sake
of
your
sweet
sister
and
my
spouse
dorothy
you
will
make
interest
to
have
me
appointed
gentleman
of
the
bedchamber
doubt
it
not
doubt
it
not
replied
nicholas
in
a
patronising
tone
my
ambition
soars
higher
than
yours
sherborne
said
richard
i
must
be
of
the
privy
seal
or
nothing
oh
what
you
will
gentlemen
what
you
will
cried
nicholas
you
can
ask
me
nothing
i
will
not
grant
always
provided
i
have
the
means
a
turn
in
the
road
now
showed
them
hoghton
tower
crowning
the
summit
of
an
isolated
and
conical
hill
about
two
miles
off
rising
proudly
in
the
midst
of
a
fair
and
fertile
plain
watered
by
the
ribble
and
the
darwen
the
stately
edifice
seemed
to
command
the
whole
country
and
so
king
james
thought
as
from
the
window
of
his
chamber
he
looked
down
upon
the
magnificent
prospect
around
him
comprehending
on
the
one
hand
the
vast
forests
of
myerscough
and
bowland
stretching
as
far
as
the
fells
near
lancaster
and
on
the
other
an
open
but
still
undulating
country
beautifully
diversified
with
wood
and
water
and
green
with
luxuriant
pastures
yellow
with
golden
grain
or
embowered
with
orchards
boasting
many
villages
and
small
towns
as
well
as
two
lovely
rivers
which
combining
their
currents
at
gradually
expanded
till
they
neared
the
sea
which
could
be
seen
gleaming
through
openings
in
the
distant
hills
as
the
king
surveyed
this
fair
scene
and
thought
how
strong
was
the
position
of
the
mansion
situated
as
it
was
upon
high
cliffs
springing
abruptly
from
the
darwen
and
how
favourably
circumstanced
with
its
forests
and
park
for
the
enjoyment
of
the
chase
of
which
he
was
passionately
fond
how
capable
of
defence
and
how
well
adapted
for
a
he
sighed
to
think
it
did
not
belong
to
the
crown
nor
was
he
wrong
in
his
estimate
of
its
strength
for
in
after
years
during
the
civil
wars
it
held
out
stoutly
against
the
parliamentary
forces
and
was
only
reduced
at
last
by
treachery
when
part
of
its
was
blown
up
destroying
an
officer
and
two
hundred
men
in
that
blast
most
wofully
though
the
hour
was
so
early
the
road
was
already
thronged
not
only
with
horsemen
and
pedestrians
of
every
degree
from
preston
but
with
rude
lumbering
vehicles
from
the
neighbouring
villages
of
plessington
brockholes
and
cuerden
driven
by
farmers
who
with
their
buxom
dames
and
daughters
decked
out
in
holiday
finery
hoped
to
gain
admittance
to
hoghton
tower
or
at
all
events
obtain
a
peep
of
the
king
as
he
rode
out
to
hunt
most
of
these
were
saluted
by
nicholas
who
scrupled
not
to
promise
them
admission
to
the
outer
court
of
the
tower
and
even
went
so
far
as
to
offer
some
of
the
comelier
damsels
a
presentation
to
the
king
occasionally
the
road
was
enlivened
by
strains
of
music
from
a
band
of
minstrels
by
a
song
or
a
chorus
from
others
or
by
the
gamesome
tricks
of
a
party
of
mummers
at
one
place
a
couple
of
tumblers
and
a
clown
were
performing
their
feats
on
a
cloth
stretched
on
the
grass
beneath
a
tree
here
the
crowd
collected
for
a
few
minutes
but
presently
gave
way
to
loud
shouts
attended
by
the
cracking
of
whips
proceeding
from
two
grooms
in
the
yellow
and
white
livery
of
sir
richard
hoghton
who
headed
some
carts
filled
with
provisions
carcases
of
sheep
and
oxen
turkeys
and
geese
pullets
and
capons
fish
bread
and
vegetables
all
bent
for
hoghton
tower
for
though
sir
richard
had
made
vast
preparations
for
his
guests
he
found
his
supplies
great
as
they
were
wholly
inadequate
to
their
wants
cracking
their
whips
in
answer
to
the
shouts
with
which
they
were
greeted
the
purveyors
galloped
on
many
a
hungry
wight
looking
wistfully
after
them
nicholas
and
his
companions
were
now
at
the
entrance
to
hoghton
park
through
which
the
darwen
coursed
after
washing
the
base
of
the
rocky
heights
on
which
the
mansion
was
situated
here
four
yeomen
of
the
guard
armed
with
halberts
and
an
officer
were
stationed
and
no
one
was
admitted
without
an
order
from
sir
richard
hoghton
possessing
a
pass
the
squire
and
his
companions
with
their
attendants
were
of
course
allowed
to
enter
but
the
throng
accompanying
them
were
sent
over
the
bridge
and
along
a
devious
road
skirting
the
park
which
though
it
went
more
than
a
mile
round
eventually
brought
them
to
their
destination
hoghton
park
though
not
very
extensive
boasted
a
great
deal
of
magnificent
timber
and
in
some
places
was
so
thickly
wooded
that
according
to
kuerden
a
man
passing
through
it
could
scarcely
have
seen
the
sun
shine
at
middle
of
day
into
one
of
these
tenebrous
groves
the
horsemen
now
plunged
and
for
some
moments
were
buried
in
the
gloom
produced
by
matted
and
overhanging
boughs
issuing
once
more
into
the
warm
sunshine
they
traversed
a
long
and
beautiful
silvan
glade
skirted
by
ancient
oaks
with
mighty
arms
and
gnarled
limbs
the
patriarchs
of
the
forest
in
the
open
ground
on
the
left
were
scattered
a
few
and
beneath
them
browsed
a
herd
of
fallow
deer
while
crossing
the
lower
end
of
the
glade
was
a
large
herd
of
red
deer
for
which
the
park
was
famous
the
hinds
tripping
nimbly
and
timidly
away
but
the
lordly
stags
with
their
branching
antlers
standing
for
a
moment
at
gaze
and
disdainfully
regarding
the
intruders
on
their
domain
little
did
they
think
how
soon
and
severely
their
courage
would
be
tried
or
how
soon
the
would
be
sounded
for
their
by
the
huntsman
but
if
happily
for
themselves
the
poor
fools
could
not
foresee
their
doom
it
was
not
equally
hidden
from
nicholas
who
predicted
what
would
ensue
and
pointed
out
one
noble
hart
which
he
thought
worthy
to
die
by
the
king
own
hand
as
if
he
understood
him
the
stately
beast
tossed
his
antlered
head
aloft
and
plunged
into
the
adjoining
thicket
but
the
squire
noted
the
spot
where
he
had
disappeared
the
glade
led
them
into
the
chase
a
glorious
of
about
two
miles
in
circumference
surrounded
by
an
amphitheatre
of
wood
and
studded
by
noble
forest
trees
variety
and
beauty
were
lent
to
it
by
an
occasional
knoll
crowned
with
timber
or
by
numerous
ferny
dells
and
dingles
as
the
horsemen
entered
upon
the
chase
they
observed
at
a
short
distance
from
them
a
herd
of
the
beautiful
but
fierce
wild
cattle
originally
from
bowland
forest
and
still
preserved
in
the
park
white
and
spangled
in
colour
with
short
sharp
horns
fine
eyes
and
small
shapely
limbs
these
animals
were
of
untameable
fierceness
possessed
of
great
cunning
and
ever
ready
to
assault
any
one
who
approached
them
they
would
often
attack
a
solitary
individual
gore
him
and
trample
him
to
death
consequently
they
were
far
more
dreaded
than
the
with
which
as
with
every
other
sort
of
game
the
neighbouring
woods
were
plentifully
stocked
well
aware
of
the
danger
they
ran
the
party
watched
the
herd
narrowly
and
distrustfully
and
would
have
galloped
on
but
this
would
only
have
provoked
pursuit
and
the
wild
cattle
were
swifter
than
any
horses
suddenly
a
milkwhite
bull
trotted
out
from
the
rest
of
the
herd
bellowing
fiercely
lashing
his
sides
with
his
tail
and
lowering
his
head
to
the
ground
as
if
meditating
an
attack
his
example
was
speedily
followed
by
the
others
and
the
whole
herd
began
to
beat
ground
and
roar
loudly
much
alarmed
by
these
hostile
manifestations
the
party
were
debating
whether
to
stand
the
onset
or
trust
to
the
fleetness
of
their
steeds
for
safety
when
just
as
the
whole
herd
with
tails
erect
and
dilated
nostrils
were
galloping
towards
them
assistance
appeared
in
the
persons
of
some
ten
or
a
dozen
mounted
prickers
who
armed
with
long
poles
pointed
with
iron
issued
with
loud
shouts
from
an
avenue
opening
upon
the
chase
at
sight
of
them
the
whole
herd
wheeled
round
and
fled
but
were
pursued
by
the
prickers
till
they
were
driven
into
the
depths
of
the
furthest
thicket
six
of
the
prickers
remained
watching
over
them
during
the
day
in
order
that
the
royal
might
not
be
disturbed
and
the
woods
echoed
with
the
bellowing
of
the
angry
brutes
while
this
was
going
forward
the
squire
and
his
companions
congratulating
themselves
on
their
narrow
escape
galloped
off
and
entered
the
long
avenue
of
sycamores
from
which
the
prickers
had
emerged
at
the
head
of
a
steep
ascent
partly
hewn
out
of
the
rock
and
partly
skirted
by
venerable
and
majestic
trees
forming
a
continuation
of
the
avenue
rose
the
embattled
of
the
proud
edifice
they
were
approaching
and
which
now
held
the
monarch
of
the
land
and
the
highest
and
noblest
of
his
court
as
guests
within
its
halls
from
the
top
of
the
central
tower
of
the
gateway
floated
the
royal
banner
while
at
the
very
moment
the
party
reached
the
foot
of
the
hill
they
were
saluted
by
a
loud
peal
of
ordnance
discharged
from
the
proclaiming
that
the
king
had
arisen
and
as
the
smoke
from
the
culverins
wreathed
round
the
standard
a
flourish
of
trumpets
was
blown
from
the
walls
and
martial
music
resounded
from
the
court
roused
by
these
stirring
sounds
nicholas
spurred
his
horse
up
the
rocky
ascent
and
followed
closely
by
his
companions
who
were
both
nearly
as
much
excited
as
himself
speedily
gained
the
great
gateway
a
massive
and
majestic
structure
occupying
the
centre
of
the
western
front
of
the
mansion
and
consisting
of
three
towers
of
great
strength
and
beauty
the
far
overtopping
the
other
two
as
in
the
arms
of
old
castile
and
sustaining
as
was
its
right
the
royal
standard
on
the
platform
stood
the
trumpeters
with
their
clarions
and
the
iron
mouths
of
the
culverins
which
had
been
recently
discharged
protruded
through
the
battlements
the
arms
and
motto
of
the
hoghtons
carved
in
stone
were
placed
upon
the
gateway
with
the
letters
the
initials
of
the
founder
of
the
tower
immediately
above
the
arched
entrance
was
the
sculptured
figure
of
a
knight
slaying
a
dragon
in
front
of
the
gateway
a
large
crowd
of
persons
were
assembled
consisting
of
the
inferior
gentry
of
the
neighbourhood
with
their
wives
daughters
and
servants
clergymen
attorneys
chirurgeons
farmers
and
tradesmen
of
all
kind
from
the
adjoining
towns
of
blackburn
preston
chorley
haslingden
garstang
and
even
lancaster
representatives
in
some
sort
or
other
of
almost
every
town
and
village
in
the
county
might
be
found
amongst
the
motley
assemblage
which
early
as
it
was
numbered
several
hundreds
many
of
those
from
the
more
distant
places
having
quitted
their
homes
soon
after
midnight
admittance
was
naturally
sought
by
all
but
here
the
same
rule
was
observed
as
at
the
park
gate
and
no
one
was
allowed
to
enter
even
the
base
court
without
authority
from
the
lord
of
the
mansion
the
great
gates
were
closed
and
two
files
of
halberdiers
were
drawn
up
under
the
deep
archway
to
keep
the
passage
clear
and
quell
disturbance
in
case
any
should
occur
while
a
gigantic
porter
stationed
in
front
of
the
wicket
rigorously
scrutinised
the
passes
these
precautions
naturally
produced
delay
and
though
many
of
the
better
part
of
the
crowd
were
entitled
to
admission
it
was
not
without
much
pushing
and
squeezing
and
considerable
detriment
to
their
gay
apparel
that
they
were
enabled
to
effect
their
object
the
comfort
of
those
outside
the
walls
had
not
however
been
altogether
neglected
by
sir
richard
hoghton
for
sheds
were
reared
under
the
trees
where
stout
march
beer
together
with
cheese
and
bread
or
oaten
cakes
and
butter
were
freely
distributed
to
all
applicants
so
that
if
some
were
disappointed
few
were
discontented
especially
when
told
that
the
gates
would
be
thrown
open
at
noon
when
during
the
time
the
king
and
the
nobles
feasted
in
the
great
they
might
partake
of
a
wild
bull
from
the
park
slaughtered
expressly
for
the
occasion
which
was
now
being
roasted
whole
within
the
base
court
that
the
latter
was
no
idle
promise
they
had
the
assurance
of
thick
smoke
rising
above
the
walls
laden
with
the
scent
of
roast
meat
and
moreover
they
could
see
through
the
wicket
a
great
fire
blazing
and
crackling
on
the
green
with
a
huge
carcass
on
an
immense
spit
before
it
and
a
couple
of
basting
it
as
nicholas
and
his
companions
forced
their
way
through
this
crowd
which
was
momently
receiving
additions
as
fresh
arrivals
took
place
the
squire
recognised
many
old
acquaintances
and
was
nodding
familiarly
right
and
left
when
he
encountered
a
woman
eye
fixed
keenly
upon
him
and
to
his
surprise
beheld
nance
redferne
nance
who
had
lost
none
of
her
good
looks
was
very
gaily
attired
with
her
fine
chestnut
hair
knotted
with
ribbons
her
stomacher
similarly
adorned
and
her
red
petticoat
looped
up
so
as
to
display
an
exceedingly
trim
ankle
and
small
foot
and
under
other
circumstances
nicholas
might
not
have
minded
staying
to
chat
with
her
but
just
now
it
was
out
of
the
question
and
he
hastily
turned
his
head
another
way
as
ill
luck
however
would
have
it
a
stoppage
occurred
at
the
moment
during
which
nance
forced
her
way
up
to
him
and
taking
hold
of
his
arm
said
in
a
low
tone
yo
mun
tae
me
in
wi
ye
squoire
take
you
in
with
me
impossible
cried
nicholas
nah
it
neaw
impossible
rejoined
nance
pertinaciously
yo
con
do
it
an
yo
shan
yo
owe
me
a
good
turn
and
mun
repay
it
now
but
why
the
devil
do
you
want
to
go
in
cried
nicholas
impatiently
you
know
the
king
is
the
sworn
enemy
of
all
witches
and
amongst
this
concourse
some
one
is
sure
to
recognise
you
and
betray
you
i
can
not
answer
for
your
safety
if
i
do
take
you
in
in
my
opinion
you
were
extremely
unwise
to
venture
here
at
all
heed
my
wisdom
or
my
folly
boh
do
as
ey
bid
yo
or
repent
it
said
nance
why
you
can
get
in
without
my
aid
observed
the
squire
trying
to
laugh
it
off
you
can
easily
fly
over
the
walls
ey
ha
left
my
broomstick
replied
nance
boh
no
more
jesting
win
yo
do
it
well
well
i
suppose
i
must
replied
nicholas
but
i
wash
my
hands
of
the
consequences
if
ill
comes
of
it
i
am
not
to
blame
you
must
go
in
as
doll
wango
that
is
as
a
character
in
the
masque
to
be
enacted
d
mark
nance
signified
that
she
perfectly
understood
him
the
whole
of
this
hurried
discourse
conducted
in
an
passed
unheard
and
unnoticed
by
the
bystanders
just
then
an
opening
took
place
amid
the
crowd
and
the
squire
pushed
through
it
hoping
to
get
rid
of
his
companion
but
he
hoped
in
vain
for
clinging
to
his
saddle
she
went
on
along
with
him
they
were
soon
under
the
deep
groined
and
ribbed
arch
of
the
gate
and
nance
would
have
been
here
turned
back
by
the
foremost
halberdier
if
nicholas
had
not
signified
somewhat
hastily
that
she
belonged
to
his
party
the
man
smiled
and
offered
no
further
opposition
and
the
gigantic
porter
next
advancing
nicholas
exhibited
his
pass
to
him
which
appearing
sufficiently
comprehensive
to
procure
admission
for
richard
and
sherborne
they
instantly
availed
themselves
of
the
licence
while
the
squire
fumbled
in
his
doublet
for
a
further
order
for
nance
at
last
he
produced
it
and
after
reading
it
the
gigantic
warder
exclaimed
with
a
smile
illumining
his
broad
features
ah
i
see
this
is
an
order
from
his
worship
sir
richard
to
admit
a
certain
woman
who
is
to
enact
doll
wango
in
the
masque
this
is
she
i
suppose
he
added
looking
at
nance
ay
ay
replied
the
squire
a
comely
wench
by
the
mass
exclaimed
the
porter
open
the
gate
no
not
yet
not
yet
good
porter
till
my
claim
be
adjusted
cried
another
woman
pushing
forward
quite
as
young
and
comely
as
nance
and
equally
gaily
dressed
i
am
the
real
doll
wango
though
i
be
generally
known
as
dame
tetlow
the
squire
engaged
me
to
play
the
part
before
the
king
and
now
this
saucy
hussy
has
taken
my
place
but
i
have
my
rights
that
i
will
odd
heart
two
doll
wangos
exclaimed
the
porter
opening
his
eyes
two
nay
beleedy
boh
there
be
three
exclaimed
an
immensely
tall
stoutly
proportioned
woman
stepping
up
to
the
increased
confusion
of
the
squire
and
the
infinite
merriment
of
the
bystanders
whose
laughter
had
been
already
excited
by
the
previous
part
of
the
scene
didna
yo
tell
me
at
myerscough
to
come
here
squire
an
ey
bess
baldwyn
should
play
doll
wango
to
your
jem
tospot
play
the
devil
for
that
what
you
all
seem
bent
upon
doing
exclaimed
the
squire
impatiently
away
with
you
i
can
have
nothing
to
say
to
you
you
gave
me
the
same
promise
at
the
castle
at
preston
last
night
said
dame
tetlow
i
had
been
drinking
and
knew
not
what
i
said
rejoined
nicholas
angrily
boh
yo
promised
me
a
few
minutes
ago
an
yo
sober
enough
now
cried
nance
ey
dunna
knoa
that
rejoined
dame
baldwyn
looking
reproachfully
at
him
boh
what
ey
dun
knoa
is
that
nother
o
these
squemous
queans
shan
ge
in
efore
me
and
she
looked
menacingly
at
them
as
if
determined
to
oppose
their
ingress
much
to
the
alarm
of
the
timorous
dame
tetlow
though
nance
returned
her
angry
glances
unmoved
for
heaven
sake
my
good
fellow
let
them
all
three
in
said
nicholas
in
a
low
tone
to
the
porter
at
the
same
time
slipping
a
gold
piece
into
his
hand
or
there
no
saying
what
may
be
the
consequence
for
they
three
infernal
viragos
i
take
the
responsibility
of
their
admittance
upon
myself
with
sir
richard
well
as
your
worship
says
i
do
like
to
see
quarrelling
amongst
women
returned
the
porter
in
a
bland
tone
so
all
three
shall
go
in
and
as
to
who
is
to
play
doll
wango
the
master
of
the
ceremonies
will
settle
that
so
you
need
give
yourself
no
more
concern
about
it
but
if
i
were
called
on
to
decide
he
added
with
an
amorous
leer
at
dame
baldwyn
whose
proportions
so
well
matched
his
own
i
know
where
my
choice
would
light
there
now
he
shouted
open
wide
the
gate
for
squire
nicholas
assheton
of
downham
and
the
three
doll
wangos
and
all
obstacles
being
thus
removed
nicholas
passed
on
with
the
three
females
amidst
the
renewed
laughter
of
the
bystanders
but
he
got
rid
of
his
plagues
as
soon
as
he
could
for
dismounting
and
throwing
his
bridle
to
an
attendant
he
vouchsafed
not
a
word
to
any
of
them
but
stepped
quickly
after
richard
and
sherborne
who
had
already
reached
the
great
fire
with
the
bull
roasting
before
it
appropriated
chiefly
to
stables
and
other
offices
the
base
court
of
hoghton
tower
consisted
of
buildings
of
various
dates
the
greater
part
belonging
to
elizabeth
time
though
some
might
be
assigned
to
an
earlier
period
while
many
alterations
and
additions
had
been
recently
made
in
anticipation
of
the
king
visit
dating
back
as
far
as
henry
the
family
had
originally
fixed
their
residence
at
the
foot
of
the
hill
on
the
banks
of
the
darwen
but
in
process
of
time
swayed
by
prouder
notions
they
mounted
the
craggy
heights
above
and
built
a
tower
upon
their
crest
it
is
melancholy
to
think
that
so
glorious
a
pile
teeming
with
so
many
historical
recollections
and
so
magnificently
situated
should
be
abandoned
and
suffered
to
go
to
decay
the
family
having
many
years
ago
quitted
it
for
walton
hall
near
and
consigned
it
to
the
occupation
of
a
few
gamekeepers
bereft
of
its
venerable
timber
its
courts
its
fine
oak
staircase
rotting
and
dilapidated
its
domestic
chapel
neglected
its
marble
chamber
broken
and
ruinous
its
wainscotings
and
ceilings
cracked
and
mouldering
its
paintings
mildewed
and
half
effaced
hoghton
tower
presents
only
the
wreck
of
its
former
grandeur
desolate
indeed
are
its
halls
and
their
glory
for
ever
departed
however
this
history
has
to
do
with
it
in
the
season
of
its
greatest
splendour
when
it
glistened
with
silks
and
velvets
and
resounded
with
loud
laughter
and
blithe
music
when
stately
nobles
and
lovely
dames
were
seen
in
the
gallery
and
a
royal
banquet
was
served
in
the
great
hall
when
its
countless
chambers
were
filled
to
overflowing
and
its
passages
echoed
with
hasty
feet
when
the
base
court
was
full
of
huntsmen
and
falconers
and
enlivened
by
the
neighing
of
steeds
and
the
baying
of
hounds
when
there
was
daily
hunting
in
the
park
and
nightly
dancing
and
diversion
in
the
hall
it
is
with
hoghton
tower
at
this
season
that
the
present
tale
has
to
do
and
not
with
it
as
it
is
now
silent
solitary
squalid
saddening
but
still
whispering
of
the
glories
of
the
past
still
telling
of
the
kingly
pageant
that
once
graced
it
the
base
court
was
divided
from
the
court
of
lodging
by
the
great
hall
and
domestic
chapel
a
narrow
vaulted
passage
on
either
side
led
to
the
upper
quadrangle
the
facade
of
which
was
magnificent
and
far
superior
in
uniformity
of
design
and
style
to
the
rest
of
the
structure
the
irregularity
of
which
however
was
not
unpleasing
the
whole
frontage
of
the
upper
court
was
richly
moulded
and
filleted
with
ranges
of
mullion
and
transom
windows
capitals
and
carved
parapets
crowned
with
stone
balls
marble
pillars
in
the
italian
style
had
been
recently
placed
near
the
porch
with
two
rows
of
pilasters
above
them
supporting
a
heavy
marble
cornice
on
which
rested
the
carved
escutcheon
of
the
family
a
flight
of
stone
steps
led
up
to
the
porch
and
within
was
a
wide
oak
staircase
so
gentle
of
ascent
that
a
man
on
horseback
could
easily
mount
it
a
feat
often
practised
in
later
days
by
one
of
the
descendants
of
the
house
in
this
part
of
the
mansion
all
the
principal
apartments
were
situated
and
here
james
was
lodged
here
also
was
the
green
room
so
called
from
its
hangings
which
he
used
for
private
conferences
and
which
was
hung
round
with
portraits
of
his
unfortunate
mother
mary
queen
of
scots
of
her
implacable
enemy
queen
elizabeth
of
his
consort
anne
of
bohemia
and
of
sir
thomas
hoghton
the
founder
of
the
tower
adjoining
it
was
the
occupied
by
the
duke
of
buckingham
with
its
napkin
panelling
and
ceiling
fretted
with
golden
fires
and
in
the
same
angle
were
rooms
occupied
by
the
duke
of
richmond
the
earls
of
pembroke
and
nottingham
and
lord
howard
of
effingham
below
was
the
library
whither
doctor
thomas
moreton
bishop
of
chester
and
his
majesty
chaplain
with
the
three
puisné
judges
of
the
king
bench
sir
john
doddridge
sir
john
crooke
and
sir
robert
hoghton
all
of
whom
were
guests
of
sir
richard
resorted
and
in
the
adjoining
wing
was
the
great
gallery
where
the
whole
of
the
nobles
and
courtiers
passed
such
of
their
time
and
that
was
not
much
as
was
not
occupied
in
feasting
or
amusements
long
corridors
ran
round
the
upper
stories
in
this
part
of
the
mansion
and
communicated
with
an
endless
series
of
rooms
which
numerous
as
they
were
were
all
occupied
and
accommodation
being
found
impossible
for
the
whole
of
the
guests
many
were
sent
to
the
new
erections
in
the
base
court
which
had
been
planned
to
meet
the
emergency
by
the
magnificent
and
provident
host
the
nobles
and
gentlemen
were
however
far
outnumbered
by
their
servants
and
the
confusion
occasioned
by
the
running
to
and
fro
of
the
various
grooms
of
the
chambers
was
indescribable
doublets
had
to
be
brushed
ruffs
plaited
hair
curled
beards
trimmed
and
all
with
the
greatest
possible
expedition
so
that
as
soon
as
day
dawned
upon
hoghton
tower
there
was
a
prodigious
racket
from
one
end
of
it
to
the
other
many
favoured
servants
slept
in
in
their
masters
rooms
but
others
not
so
fortunate
and
unable
to
find
accommodation
even
in
the
garrets
for
the
smallest
rooms
and
those
nearest
the
roof
were
put
in
requisition
slept
upon
the
benches
in
the
hall
while
several
sat
up
all
night
carousing
in
the
great
kitchen
keeping
company
with
the
cooks
and
their
assistants
who
were
busied
all
the
time
in
preparations
for
the
feasting
of
the
morrow
such
was
the
state
of
things
inside
hoghton
tower
early
on
the
eventful
morning
in
question
and
out
of
doors
especially
in
the
base
court
which
nicholas
was
traversing
the
noise
bustle
and
confusion
were
equally
great
wide
as
was
the
area
it
was
filled
with
various
personages
some
newly
arrived
and
seeking
information
as
to
their
quarters
not
very
easily
obtained
for
it
seemed
every
body
business
to
ask
questions
and
no
one
to
answer
them
some
gathered
in
groups
round
the
falconers
and
huntsmen
who
had
suddenly
risen
into
great
importance
others
and
these
were
for
the
most
part
smart
young
pages
in
brilliant
liveries
chattering
and
making
love
to
every
pretty
damsel
they
encountered
putting
them
out
of
countenance
by
their
licence
and
strange
oaths
and
rousing
the
anger
of
their
parents
and
the
jealousy
of
their
rustic
admirers
others
of
a
graver
sort
with
dress
of
formal
cut
and
puritanical
expression
of
countenance
shrugging
their
shoulders
and
looking
sourly
on
the
whole
proceedings
luckily
they
were
in
the
minority
for
the
generality
of
the
groups
were
composed
of
lively
and
people
bent
apparently
upon
amusement
and
tolerably
certain
of
finding
it
through
these
various
groups
numerous
lackeys
were
passing
swiftly
and
continuously
to
and
fro
bearing
a
cap
a
mantle
or
a
sword
and
pushing
aside
all
who
interfered
with
their
progress
with
a
by
your
leave
my
masters
your
pardon
fair
mistress
or
out
of
my
way
knave
and
as
the
stables
occupied
one
entire
angle
of
the
court
there
were
grooms
without
end
dressing
the
horses
at
the
doors
watering
them
at
the
troughs
or
leading
them
about
amid
the
admiring
or
criticising
bystanders
the
king
horses
were
of
course
objects
of
special
attraction
and
such
as
could
obtain
a
glimpse
of
them
and
of
the
royal
coach
thought
themselves
especially
favoured
besides
what
was
going
forward
below
the
windows
looking
into
the
court
were
all
full
of
curious
observers
and
much
loud
conversation
took
place
between
those
placed
at
them
and
their
friends
underneath
from
all
this
some
idea
will
be
formed
of
the
tremendous
din
that
prevailed
but
though
with
much
confusion
there
was
no
positive
disorder
still
less
brawling
for
yeomen
of
the
guard
being
stationed
at
various
points
perfect
order
was
maintained
several
minstrels
mummers
and
in
various
fantastic
habits
swelled
the
throng
enlivening
it
with
their
strains
or
feats
and
amongst
other
privileged
characters
admitted
was
a
tom
bedlam
a
licensed
beggar
in
a
singular
and
picturesque
garb
with
a
plate
of
tin
engraved
with
his
name
attached
to
his
left
arm
and
a
great
ox
horn
which
he
was
continually
blowing
suspended
by
a
leathern
baldric
from
his
neck
scarcely
had
nicholas
joined
his
companions
than
word
was
given
that
the
king
was
about
to
attend
morning
prayers
in
the
domestic
chapel
upon
this
an
immediate
rush
was
made
in
that
direction
by
the
crowd
but
the
greater
part
were
kept
back
by
the
guard
who
crossed
their
halberts
to
prevent
their
ingress
and
a
few
only
were
allowed
to
enter
the
antechamber
leading
to
the
chapel
amongst
whom
were
the
squire
and
his
companions
here
they
were
detained
within
it
till
service
was
over
and
as
prayers
were
read
by
the
bishop
of
chester
and
the
whole
court
was
present
this
was
a
great
disappointment
to
them
at
the
end
of
half
an
hour
two
very
courtly
personages
came
forth
each
bearing
a
white
wand
and
announcing
that
the
king
was
coming
forth
the
assemblage
immediately
divided
into
two
lines
to
allow
a
passage
for
the
monarch
nicholas
assheton
informed
richard
in
a
whisper
that
the
foremost
and
stateliest
of
the
two
gentlemen
was
lord
stanhope
of
harrington
the
and
the
other
a
handsome
young
man
of
slight
figure
and
somewhat
libertine
expression
of
countenance
was
the
renowned
sir
john
finett
master
of
the
ceremonies
notwithstanding
his
licentiousness
however
which
was
the
vice
of
the
age
and
the
stain
of
the
court
sir
john
was
a
man
of
wit
and
address
and
perfectly
conversant
with
the
duties
of
his
office
of
which
he
has
left
satisfactory
evidence
in
an
amusing
tractate
finetti
philoxenis
some
little
time
elapsed
before
the
king
made
his
appearance
during
which
the
curiosity
of
such
as
had
not
seen
him
as
was
the
case
with
richard
was
greatly
excited
the
young
man
wondered
whether
the
pedantic
monarch
whose
character
perplexed
the
shrewdest
would
answer
his
preconceived
notions
and
whether
it
would
turn
out
that
his
portraits
were
like
him
while
these
thoughts
were
passing
through
his
mind
a
shuffling
noise
was
heard
without
and
king
james
appeared
at
the
doorway
he
paused
there
for
a
moment
to
place
his
plumed
and
jewelled
cap
upon
his
head
and
to
speak
a
word
with
sir
john
finett
and
during
this
richard
had
an
opportunity
of
observing
him
the
portraits
like
but
the
artists
had
flattered
him
though
not
much
there
was
great
shrewdness
of
look
but
there
was
also
a
vacant
expression
which
seemed
to
contradict
the
idea
of
profound
wisdom
generally
ascribed
to
him
when
in
perfect
repose
which
they
were
not
for
more
than
a
minute
the
features
were
thoughtful
benevolent
and
pleasing
and
richard
began
to
think
him
quite
handsome
when
another
change
was
wrought
by
some
remark
of
sir
john
finett
as
the
master
of
the
ceremonies
told
his
tale
the
king
fine
dark
eyes
blazed
with
an
unpleasant
light
and
he
laughed
so
loudly
and
indecorously
at
the
close
of
the
narrative
with
his
great
tongue
hanging
out
of
his
mouth
and
tears
running
down
his
cheeks
that
the
young
man
was
quite
sickened
the
king
face
was
thin
and
long
the
cheeks
shaven
but
the
lips
clothed
with
mustaches
and
a
scanty
beard
covered
his
chin
the
hair
was
brushed
away
from
the
face
and
the
cap
placed
at
the
back
of
the
head
so
as
to
exhibit
a
high
bald
forehead
of
which
he
was
prodigiously
vain
james
was
fully
equipped
for
the
chase
and
wore
a
green
silk
doublet
quilted
as
all
his
garments
were
so
as
to
be
enormous
likewise
thickly
stuffed
and
buff
boots
fitting
closely
to
the
leg
and
turned
slightly
over
at
the
knee
with
the
edges
fringed
with
gold
this
was
almost
the
only
appearance
of
finery
about
the
dress
except
a
row
of
gold
buttons
down
the
jerkin
attached
to
his
girdle
he
wore
a
large
pouch
with
the
mouth
drawn
together
by
silken
cords
and
a
small
silver
bugle
was
suspended
from
his
neck
by
a
baldric
of
green
silk
bands
edged
with
lace
and
slightly
turned
down
on
either
side
of
the
face
completed
his
attire
there
was
nothing
majestic
but
the
very
reverse
in
the
deportment
and
he
seemed
only
kept
upright
by
the
exceeding
stiffness
of
his
cumbersome
clothes
with
the
appearance
of
being
corpulent
he
was
not
so
in
reality
and
his
weak
legs
and
bent
knees
were
scarcely
able
to
support
his
frame
he
always
used
a
stick
and
generally
sought
the
additional
aid
of
a
favourite
arm
in
this
instance
the
person
selected
was
sir
gilbert
hoghton
the
eldest
son
of
sir
richard
and
subsequent
owner
of
hoghton
tower
indebted
for
the
high
court
favour
he
enjoyed
partly
to
his
graceful
person
and
accomplishments
and
partly
to
his
marriage
having
espoused
a
daughter
of
sir
john
aston
of
cranford
who
as
sister
of
the
duchess
of
buckingham
and
a
descendant
of
the
blood
royal
of
the
stuarts
was
a
great
help
to
his
rapid
rise
the
handsome
young
knight
was
skilled
in
all
manly
exercises
and
cited
as
a
model
of
grace
in
the
dance
constant
in
attendance
upon
the
court
he
frequently
took
part
in
the
masques
performed
before
it
like
the
king
he
was
fully
equipped
for
hunting
but
greater
contrast
could
not
have
been
found
than
between
his
tall
fine
form
and
the
king
ungainly
figure
sir
gilbert
had
remained
behind
with
the
rest
of
the
courtiers
in
the
chapel
but
calling
him
james
seized
his
arm
and
set
forward
at
his
usual
shambling
pace
as
he
went
on
nodding
his
head
in
return
to
the
profound
salutations
of
the
assemblage
his
eye
rolled
round
them
until
it
alighted
on
richard
assheton
and
nudging
sir
gilbert
he
asked
wha
that
a
bonnie
lad
but
waesome
pale
sir
gilbert
however
was
unable
to
answer
the
inquiry
but
nicholas
who
stood
beside
the
young
man
was
determined
not
to
lose
the
opportunity
of
introducing
him
and
accordingly
moved
a
step
forward
and
made
a
profound
obeisance
this
youth
may
it
please
your
majesty
he
said
is
my
cousin
richard
assheton
son
and
heir
of
sir
richard
assheton
of
middleton
one
of
your
majesty
most
loyal
and
devoted
servants
and
who
i
trust
will
have
the
honour
of
being
presented
to
you
in
the
course
of
the
day
we
trust
so
too
maister
nicholas
assheton
for
that
if
we
dinna
forget
is
your
ain
name
replied
james
and
if
the
sire
resembles
the
son
whilk
is
not
always
the
case
as
our
gude
freend
sir
gilbert
is
evidence
being
as
unlike
his
worthy
father
as
a
man
weel
can
be
if
as
we
say
sir
richard
resembles
this
callant
he
must
be
a
gentleman
but
god
santie
lad
how
cam
you
in
sic
sad
and
sombre
abulyiements
hae
ye
nae
braw
claes
to
put
on
to
grace
our
coming
black
isna
the
fashion
at
our
court
as
sir
gilbert
will
tell
ye
and
though
a
suit
o
sables
may
become
you
it
no
pleasing
in
our
sight
let
us
see
you
in
gayer
apparel
at
dinner
richard
who
was
considerably
embarrassed
by
the
royal
address
merely
bowed
and
nicholas
again
took
upon
himself
to
answer
for
him
your
majesty
will
be
pleased
to
pardon
him
he
said
but
he
is
unaccustomed
to
court
fashions
having
passed
all
his
time
in
a
wild
and
uncivilized
district
where
except
on
rare
and
happy
occasions
like
the
present
the
refined
graces
of
life
seldom
reach
us
weel
we
wouldna
be
hard
upon
him
said
the
king
and
mayhap
the
family
has
sustained
some
recent
loss
and
he
is
in
mourning
i
can
not
offer
that
excuse
for
him
sire
replied
nicholas
who
began
to
flatter
himself
he
was
making
considerable
progress
in
the
good
graces
it
is
simply
an
affair
of
the
heart
puir
chiel
we
pity
him
cried
the
king
and
sae
it
is
a
hopeless
suit
young
sir
he
added
to
richard
canna
we
throw
in
a
good
word
for
ye
do
we
ken
the
lassie
and
is
she
to
be
here
i
am
quite
at
a
loss
how
to
answer
your
majesty
questions
replied
richard
and
my
cousin
nicholas
has
very
unfairly
betrayed
my
secret
hoot
toot
na
lad
exclaimed
james
it
wasna
he
wha
betrayed
your
secret
but
our
ain
discernment
that
revealed
it
to
us
we
kenned
your
ailment
at
a
glance
few
things
are
hidden
from
the
king
eye
and
we
could
tell
ye
mair
aboot
yoursel
and
the
lassie
you
deeing
for
if
we
cared
to
speak
it
but
just
now
we
have
other
fish
to
fry
and
must
awa
and
break
our
fast
of
the
which
if
truth
maun
be
spoken
we
stand
greatly
in
need
for
creature
comforts
maun
be
aye
looked
to
as
weel
as
spiritual
wants
though
the
latter
should
be
ever
cared
for
first
as
is
our
ain
rule
and
in
so
doing
we
offer
an
example
to
our
subjects
which
they
will
do
weel
to
follow
later
in
the
day
we
will
talk
further
to
you
on
the
subject
but
meanwhile
gie
us
the
name
of
your
lassie
loo
oh
spare
me
your
majesty
cried
richard
her
name
is
alizon
nutter
interposed
nicholas
what
a
daughter
of
alice
nutter
of
rough
lee
exclaimed
james
the
same
sire
replied
nicholas
much
surprised
at
the
extent
of
information
manifested
by
the
king
why
saul
o
my
body
man
she
a
witch
a
witch
d
ken
that
cried
the
king
with
a
look
of
abhorrence
a
mischievous
and
malignant
vermin
with
which
this
pairt
of
our
realm
is
sair
plagued
but
which
with
god
help
we
will
thoroughly
extirpate
sae
the
lass
is
a
daughter
of
alice
nutter
ha
that
accounts
for
your
grewsome
looks
lad
odd
life
i
see
it
all
now
i
understand
what
is
the
matter
with
you
look
at
him
sir
gilbert
look
at
him
i
say
does
naething
strike
you
as
strange
about
him
nothing
more
than
that
he
is
naturally
embarrassed
by
your
mode
of
speech
replied
the
knight
you
lack
the
penetration
of
the
king
sir
gilbert
cried
james
i
will
tell
you
what
ails
him
he
is
bewitchit
forespoken
exclamations
were
uttered
by
all
the
bystanders
and
every
eye
was
fixed
on
richard
who
felt
ready
to
sink
to
the
ground
i
affirm
he
is
bewitchit
continued
the
king
and
wha
sae
likely
to
do
it
as
the
glamouring
hizzie
that
has
ensnared
him
she
has
ill
bluid
in
her
veins
and
can
chant
deevil
cantrips
as
weel
as
the
mither
or
ony
o
them
a
you
are
mistaken
sire
cried
richard
earnestly
alizon
will
be
here
with
my
father
and
sister
and
if
you
deign
to
receive
her
i
am
sure
you
will
judge
her
differently
we
shall
perpend
the
point
of
receiving
her
replied
the
king
gravely
but
we
are
rarely
young
man
and
seldom
change
our
opinion
except
upon
gude
grounds
and
those
you
arena
like
to
offer
us
belike
ye
hae
been
lang
ill
oh
no
your
majesty
i
was
suddenly
seized
about
a
month
ago
replied
richard
suddenly
seized
eh
exclaimed
james
winking
cunningly
at
those
near
him
and
ye
swarfit
awa
wi
the
pain
i
guessed
it
and
whaur
was
alizon
the
while
at
that
time
she
was
a
guest
at
middleton
replied
richard
but
it
is
impossible
my
illness
can
in
any
way
be
attributed
to
her
i
will
answer
with
my
life
for
her
perfect
innocence
you
may
have
to
answer
wi
your
life
for
your
misplaced
faith
in
her
said
the
king
but
i
tell
you
naething
naething
wicked
at
all
events
is
impossible
to
witches
and
the
haill
case
even
by
your
own
showin
is
very
suspicious
i
have
heard
somewhat
of
the
story
of
alice
nutter
but
not
the
haill
truth
but
there
are
folk
here
wha
can
enlighten
us
mair
fully
thus
much
i
do
ken
that
she
is
a
notorious
witch
and
a
fugitive
from
justice
though
siblins
you
maister
nicholas
assheton
could
give
an
inkling
of
her
if
you
were
so
disposed
nay
never
look
doited
man
he
added
laughing
i
bring
nae
charges
against
you
ye
arena
on
your
trial
noo
but
this
is
a
serious
matter
and
maun
be
seriously
considered
before
we
dismiss
it
you
say
alizon
will
be
here
sae
far
weel
canna
you
contrive
to
produce
the
mother
too
maister
nicholas
sire
exclaimed
nicholas
nay
then
we
maun
gang
our
ain
way
to
wark
continued
james
we
are
tauld
ye
hae
a
petition
to
offer
us
and
our
will
and
pleasure
is
that
you
present
it
afore
we
go
forth
to
the
chase
and
after
we
have
partaken
of
our
matutinal
refection
whilk
we
will
nae
langer
delay
for
sooth
to
say
we
are
weel
nigh
famished
look
ye
sirs
neither
of
you
is
to
quit
hoghton
tower
without
our
permission
had
and
obtained
we
do
not
place
you
under
arrest
neither
do
we
inhibit
you
from
the
chase
or
from
any
other
sports
but
you
are
to
remain
here
at
our
sovereign
pleasure
have
we
your
word
that
you
will
not
attempt
to
disobey
the
injunction
you
have
mine
undoubtedly
sire
replied
richard
and
mine
too
added
nicholas
and
i
hope
to
justify
myself
before
your
majesty
we
shall
be
weel
pleased
to
hear
ye
do
it
man
rejoined
the
king
laughing
and
shuffling
on
but
we
hae
our
doubts
we
hae
our
doubts
his
majesty
talks
of
going
to
breakfast
and
says
he
is
famished
observed
nicholas
to
sherborne
as
the
king
departed
but
he
has
completely
taken
away
my
appetite
no
wonder
replied
the
other
chapter
the
royal
declaration
concerning
lawful
sports
on
the
sunday
not
many
paces
after
the
king
marched
the
duke
of
buckingham
then
in
the
zenith
of
his
power
and
in
the
full
perfection
of
his
unequalled
beauty
eclipsing
all
the
rest
of
the
nobles
in
splendour
of
apparel
as
he
did
in
stateliness
of
deportment
haughtily
returning
the
salutations
made
him
which
were
scarcely
less
reverential
than
those
addressed
to
the
monarch
himself
the
prime
favourite
moved
on
all
eyes
following
his
majestic
figure
to
the
door
buckingham
walked
alone
as
if
he
had
been
a
prince
of
the
blood
but
after
him
came
a
throng
of
nobles
consisting
of
the
earl
of
pembroke
high
chamberlain
the
duke
of
richmond
master
of
the
household
the
earl
of
nottingham
lord
high
admiral
viscount
brackley
lord
howard
of
effingham
lord
zouche
president
of
wales
with
the
lords
knollys
mordaunt
conipton
and
grey
of
groby
one
or
two
of
the
noblemen
seemed
inclined
to
question
richard
as
to
what
had
passed
between
him
and
the
king
but
the
young
reserved
and
somewhat
stern
manner
deterred
them
next
came
the
three
judges
doddridge
crooke
and
hoghton
whose
countenances
wore
an
enforced
gravity
for
if
any
faith
could
be
placed
in
rubicund
cheeks
and
portly
persons
they
were
not
indisposed
to
and
conviviality
after
the
judges
came
the
bishop
of
chester
the
chaplain
who
had
officiated
on
the
present
occasion
and
who
was
in
his
full
pontifical
robes
he
was
accompanied
by
the
lord
of
the
mansion
sir
richard
hoghton
a
hale
handsome
man
between
fifty
and
sixty
with
silvery
hair
and
beard
a
robust
but
commanding
person
a
fresh
complexion
and
features
by
no
means
warranting
from
any
marked
dissimilarity
to
those
of
his
son
the
king
scandalous
jest
a
crowd
of
baronets
and
knights
succeeded
including
sir
arthur
capel
sir
thomas
brudenell
sir
edward
montague
sir
edmund
trafford
sheriff
of
the
county
sir
edward
mosley
and
sir
ralph
assheton
the
latter
looked
grave
and
anxious
and
as
he
passed
his
relatives
said
in
a
low
tone
to
richard
i
am
told
alizon
is
to
be
here
is
it
so
she
is
replied
the
young
man
but
why
do
you
ask
is
she
in
danger
if
so
let
her
be
warned
against
coming
on
no
account
replied
sir
ralph
that
would
only
increase
the
suspicion
already
attaching
to
her
no
she
must
face
the
danger
and
i
hope
will
be
able
to
avert
it
but
what
the
danger
asked
richard
in
heaven
name
speak
more
plainly
i
can
not
do
so
now
replied
sir
ralph
we
will
take
counsel
together
anon
her
enemies
are
at
work
and
if
you
tarry
here
a
few
minutes
longer
you
will
understand
whom
i
mean
and
he
passed
on
a
large
crowd
now
poured
indiscriminately
out
of
the
chapel
and
amongst
it
nicholas
perceived
many
of
his
friends
and
neighbours
townley
of
townley
park
parker
of
browsholme
shuttleworth
of
gawthorpe
sir
thomas
metcalfe
and
roger
nowell
with
the
latter
was
master
potts
and
richard
was
then
at
no
loss
to
understand
against
whom
sir
ralph
had
warned
him
a
fierce
light
blazed
in
roger
nowell
keen
eyes
as
he
first
remarked
the
two
asshetons
and
a
smile
of
gratified
vengeance
played
about
his
lips
but
he
quelled
the
fire
in
a
moment
and
compressing
his
hard
mouth
more
closely
bowed
coldly
and
ceremoniously
to
them
metcalfe
did
the
same
not
so
master
potts
halting
for
a
moment
he
said
with
a
spiteful
look
look
to
yourself
master
nicholas
and
you
too
master
richard
a
day
of
reckoning
is
coming
for
both
of
you
and
with
this
he
sprang
nimbly
after
his
client
what
means
the
fellow
cried
nicholas
but
that
we
are
here
as
it
were
in
the
precincts
of
a
palace
i
would
after
him
and
cudgel
him
soundly
for
his
insolence
and
wha
that
ye
be
after
dinging
man
cried
a
sharp
voice
behind
him
no
that
puir
feckless
body
that
has
jist
skippit
aff
if
sae
ye
tak
the
wrang
soo
by
the
lugg
and
i
counsel
you
to
let
him
bide
for
he
high
i
favour
wi
the
king
turning
at
this
address
nicholas
recognised
the
king
jester
archie
armstrong
a
merry
little
knave
with
light
blue
eyes
long
yellow
hair
hanging
about
his
ears
and
a
sandy
beard
there
was
a
great
deal
of
mother
wit
about
archie
and
quite
as
much
shrewdness
as
folly
he
wore
no
distinctive
dress
as
jester
the
bauble
and
coxcomb
having
been
long
discontinued
but
was
simply
clad
in
the
royal
livery
and
so
master
potts
is
in
favour
with
his
majesty
eh
archie
asked
the
squire
hoping
to
obtain
some
information
from
him
and
sae
war
you
the
day
efore
yesterday
when
you
hunted
at
myerscough
replied
the
jester
but
how
have
i
forfeited
the
king
good
opinion
asked
nicholas
come
you
are
a
good
fellow
archie
and
will
tell
me
dinna
think
to
fleech
me
man
replied
the
jester
i
ken
what
i
ken
and
that
mair
than
you
get
frae
me
wi
a
your
speering
the
king
secrets
are
safe
wi
archie
and
for
a
good
reason
that
he
is
never
tauld
them
you
a
gude
huntsman
and
sae
is
his
majesty
but
there
ae
kind
o
game
he
likes
better
than
anither
and
that
to
be
found
maistly
i
these
pairts
i
mean
witches
and
sic
like
fearfu
carlines
we
maun
hae
the
country
rid
o
them
and
that
what
his
majesty
intends
and
if
you
a
wise
man
you
lend
him
a
helping
hand
but
i
maun
in
to
disjune
and
with
this
the
jester
capered
off
leaving
nicholas
like
one
stupefied
he
was
roused
however
by
a
smart
slap
on
the
shoulder
from
sir
john
finett
what
pondering
over
the
masque
master
nicholas
or
thinking
of
the
petition
you
have
to
present
to
his
majesty
cried
the
master
of
the
ceremonies
let
neither
trouble
you
the
one
will
be
well
played
i
doubt
not
and
the
other
well
received
i
am
sure
for
i
know
the
sentiments
on
the
subject
but
touching
the
dame
master
nicholas
have
you
found
one
willing
and
able
to
take
part
in
the
masque
i
have
found
several
willing
sir
john
replied
nicholas
but
as
to
their
ability
that
is
another
question
however
one
of
them
may
do
as
a
they
are
all
in
the
base
court
and
shall
wait
on
you
when
you
please
and
then
you
can
make
your
election
so
far
well
replied
finett
it
may
be
that
we
shall
have
ben
jonson
here
rare
ben
the
prince
of
poets
and
sir
richard
hoghton
expects
him
ben
is
preparing
a
masque
for
christmas
to
be
called
vision
of
delight
in
which
his
highness
the
prince
is
to
be
a
principal
actor
and
some
verses
which
have
been
recited
to
me
are
amongst
the
daintiest
ever
indited
by
the
bard
it
will
be
a
singular
pleasure
to
me
to
see
him
said
nicholas
for
i
hold
ben
jonson
in
the
highest
esteem
as
a
poet
ay
above
them
all
unless
it
be
will
shakspeare
ay
you
do
well
to
except
shakspeare
rejoined
sir
john
finett
great
as
ben
jonson
is
and
for
wit
and
learning
no
man
surpasses
him
he
is
not
to
be
compared
with
shakspeare
who
for
profound
knowledge
of
nature
and
of
all
the
highest
qualities
of
dramatic
art
is
unapproachable
but
ours
is
a
learned
court
master
nicholas
and
therefore
we
have
a
learned
poet
but
a
right
good
fellow
is
ben
jonson
and
a
boon
companion
though
somewhat
prone
to
sarcasm
as
you
will
find
if
you
drink
with
him
over
his
cups
he
will
rail
at
courts
and
courtiers
in
good
set
terms
i
promise
you
and
i
myself
have
come
in
for
his
gibes
however
i
love
him
none
the
less
for
his
quips
for
i
know
it
is
his
humour
to
utter
them
and
so
overlook
what
in
another
and
less
deserving
person
i
should
assuredly
resent
but
is
not
that
young
man
who
is
now
going
forth
your
cousin
richard
assheton
i
thought
so
the
king
has
had
a
strange
tale
whispered
in
his
ear
that
the
youth
has
been
bewitched
by
a
maiden
alizon
nutter
i
think
she
is
named
of
whom
he
is
enamoured
i
know
not
what
truth
may
be
in
the
charge
but
the
youth
himself
seems
to
warrant
it
for
he
looks
ghastly
a
letter
was
sent
to
his
majesty
at
myerscough
communicating
this
and
certain
other
particulars
with
which
i
am
not
acquainted
but
i
know
they
relate
to
some
professors
of
the
black
art
in
your
country
the
soil
of
which
seems
favourable
to
the
growth
of
such
noxious
weeds
and
at
first
he
was
much
disturbed
by
it
but
in
the
end
decided
that
both
parties
should
be
brought
hither
without
being
made
aware
of
his
design
that
he
might
see
and
judge
for
himself
in
the
matter
accordingly
a
messenger
was
sent
over
to
middleton
hall
as
from
sir
richard
hoghton
inviting
the
whole
family
to
the
tower
and
giving
sir
richard
assheton
to
understand
it
was
the
king
pleasure
he
should
bring
with
him
a
certain
young
damsel
named
alizon
nutter
of
whom
mention
had
been
made
to
him
sir
richard
had
no
choice
but
to
obey
and
promised
compliance
with
his
majesty
injunctions
an
officer
however
was
left
on
the
watch
and
this
very
morning
reported
to
his
majesty
that
young
richard
assheton
had
already
set
out
with
the
intention
of
going
to
preston
but
had
passed
the
night
at
and
that
sir
richard
his
daughter
dorothy
and
alizon
nutter
would
be
here
before
noon
his
majesty
has
laid
his
plans
carefully
replied
nicholas
and
i
can
easily
conjecture
from
whom
he
received
the
information
which
is
as
false
as
it
is
malicious
but
are
you
aware
sir
john
upon
what
evidence
the
charge
is
supported
for
mere
suspicion
is
not
enough
in
cases
of
witchcraft
suspicion
enough
replied
the
knight
gravely
slender
proofs
are
required
the
girl
is
the
daughter
of
a
notorious
witch
that
is
against
her
the
young
man
is
ailing
that
is
against
her
too
but
a
witness
i
believe
will
be
produced
though
who
i
can
not
say
gracious
heaven
what
wickedness
there
must
be
in
the
world
when
such
a
charge
can
be
brought
against
one
so
good
and
so
unoffending
cried
nicholas
a
maiden
more
devout
than
alizon
never
existed
nor
one
holding
the
crime
she
is
charged
with
in
greater
abhorrence
she
injure
richard
she
would
lay
down
her
life
for
him
and
would
have
been
his
wife
but
for
scruples
the
most
delicate
and
disinterested
on
her
part
but
we
will
establish
her
innocence
before
his
majesty
and
confound
her
enemies
it
is
with
that
hope
that
i
have
given
you
this
information
sir
of
which
i
am
sure
you
will
make
no
improper
use
replied
sir
john
i
have
heard
a
similar
character
to
that
you
have
given
of
alizon
and
am
unwilling
she
should
fall
a
victim
to
art
or
malice
be
upon
your
guard
too
master
nicholas
for
other
investigations
will
take
place
at
the
same
time
and
some
matters
may
come
forth
in
which
you
are
concerned
the
king
arms
are
long
and
reach
and
strike
far
and
his
eyes
see
clearly
when
not
hoodwinked
or
when
other
people
see
for
him
and
now
good
sir
you
must
want
breakfast
here
faryngton
he
added
to
an
attendant
show
master
nicholas
assheton
to
his
lodging
in
the
base
court
and
attend
upon
him
as
if
he
were
your
master
i
will
come
for
you
sir
when
it
is
time
to
present
the
petition
to
the
king
so
saying
he
bowed
and
walked
forth
turning
into
the
upper
quadrangle
while
nicholas
followed
faryngton
into
the
lower
court
where
he
found
his
friends
waiting
for
him
speedily
ascertaining
where
their
lodgings
were
situated
faryngton
led
them
to
a
building
on
the
left
almost
opposite
to
the
great
bonfire
and
ascending
a
flight
of
steps
ushered
them
into
a
commodious
and
room
looking
into
the
court
this
done
he
disappeared
but
soon
afterwards
returned
with
two
yeomen
of
the
kitchen
one
carrying
a
tray
of
provisions
upon
his
head
and
the
other
sustaining
a
basket
of
wine
under
his
arm
and
a
snowy
napkin
being
laid
upon
the
table
trenchers
viands
and
flasks
were
soon
arranged
in
very
tempting
order
so
tempting
indeed
that
the
squire
notwithstanding
his
assertion
that
his
appetite
had
been
taken
away
fell
to
work
with
his
customary
vigour
and
plied
a
flask
of
excellent
bordeaux
so
incessantly
that
another
had
to
be
placed
before
him
sherborne
did
equal
justice
to
the
good
cheer
and
richard
not
only
forced
himself
to
eat
but
to
the
squire
great
surprise
swallowed
more
than
one
deep
draught
of
wine
having
thus
administered
to
the
wants
of
the
guests
and
seeing
his
presence
was
no
longer
either
necessary
or
desired
faryngton
vanished
first
promising
to
go
and
see
that
all
was
got
ready
for
them
in
the
sleeping
apartments
notwithstanding
the
man
civility
there
was
an
about
him
that
made
nicholas
suspect
he
was
placed
over
them
by
sir
john
finett
to
watch
their
movements
and
he
resolved
to
be
upon
his
guard
i
am
glad
to
see
you
drink
lad
he
observed
to
richard
as
soon
as
they
were
alone
a
cup
of
wine
will
do
you
good
do
you
think
so
replied
richard
filling
his
goblet
anew
i
want
to
get
back
my
spirits
and
strength
to
sustain
myself
no
matter
how
to
look
well
ha
ha
if
i
can
only
make
this
frail
machine
carry
me
stoutly
through
the
king
visit
i
care
not
how
soon
it
falls
to
pieces
afterwards
i
see
your
motive
dick
replied
nicholas
you
hope
to
turn
away
suspicion
from
alizon
by
this
device
but
you
must
not
go
to
excess
or
you
will
defeat
your
scheme
i
will
do
something
to
convince
the
king
he
is
mistaken
in
me
that
i
am
not
bewitched
cried
richard
rising
and
striding
across
the
room
bewitched
and
by
alizon
too
i
could
laugh
at
the
charge
but
that
it
is
too
horrible
had
any
other
than
the
king
breathed
it
i
would
have
slain
him
his
majesty
has
been
abused
by
the
malice
of
that
knavish
attorney
potts
who
has
always
manifested
the
greatest
hostility
towards
alizon
said
nicholas
but
he
will
not
prevail
for
she
has
only
to
show
herself
to
dispel
all
prejudice
you
are
right
nicholas
cried
richard
and
yet
the
king
seems
already
to
have
prejudged
her
and
his
obstinacy
may
lead
to
her
destruction
speak
not
so
loudly
dick
in
heaven
name
said
the
squire
in
alarm
these
walls
may
have
ears
and
echoes
may
repeat
every
word
you
utter
then
let
them
tell
the
king
that
alizon
is
innocent
cried
richard
stopping
and
replenishing
his
goblet
here
to
her
health
and
confusion
to
her
enemies
i
drink
that
toast
with
pleasure
dick
replied
the
squire
but
i
must
forbid
you
more
wine
you
are
not
used
to
it
and
the
fumes
will
mount
to
your
brain
come
and
sit
down
beside
us
that
we
may
talk
said
sherborne
richard
obeyed
and
leaning
over
the
table
asked
in
a
low
deep
tone
where
is
mistress
nutter
nicholas
the
squire
looked
towards
the
door
before
he
answered
and
then
said
i
will
tell
you
after
the
destruction
of
malkin
tower
and
the
band
of
robbers
she
was
taken
to
a
solitary
hut
near
barley
booth
at
the
foot
of
pendle
hill
and
the
next
day
was
conveyed
across
bowland
forest
to
poulton
in
the
fyld
on
the
borders
of
morecambe
bay
with
the
intention
of
getting
her
on
board
some
vessel
bound
for
the
isle
of
man
arrangements
were
made
for
this
purpose
but
when
the
time
came
she
refused
to
go
and
was
brought
secretly
back
to
the
hut
near
barley
where
she
has
been
ever
since
though
her
place
of
concealment
was
hidden
even
from
you
and
her
daughter
the
captain
of
the
robbers
fogg
or
demdike
escaped
did
he
not
said
richard
ay
in
the
confusion
occasioned
by
the
blowing
up
of
the
tower
he
managed
to
get
away
replied
nicholas
and
we
were
unable
to
follow
him
as
our
attentions
had
to
be
bestowed
upon
mistress
nutter
this
was
the
more
unlucky
as
through
his
instrumentality
jem
and
his
mother
elizabeth
were
liberated
from
the
dungeon
in
which
they
were
placed
in
whalley
abbey
prior
to
their
removal
to
lancaster
castle
and
none
of
them
have
been
heard
of
since
and
i
hope
will
never
be
heard
of
again
cried
richard
but
is
mistress
nutter
retreat
secure
think
you
may
it
not
be
discovered
by
some
of
nowell
emissaries
i
trust
not
replied
nicholas
but
her
voluntary
surrender
is
more
to
be
apprehended
for
when
i
last
saw
her
on
the
night
before
starting
for
myerscough
she
told
me
she
was
determined
to
give
herself
up
for
trial
and
her
motives
could
scarce
be
combated
for
she
declares
that
unless
she
submits
herself
to
the
justice
of
man
and
expiates
her
offences
she
can
not
be
saved
she
now
seems
as
resolute
in
good
as
she
was
heretofore
resolute
in
evil
if
she
perishes
thus
her
for
thus
it
becomes
will
be
alizon
cried
richard
so
i
told
her
replied
nicholas
but
she
continued
inflexible
am
born
to
be
the
cause
of
misery
to
others
and
most
to
those
i
love
most
she
said
i
can
not
fly
from
justice
there
is
no
escape
for
me
she
is
right
cried
richard
there
is
no
escape
but
the
grave
whither
we
are
all
three
hurrying
a
terrible
fatality
attaches
to
us
nay
say
not
so
dick
rejoined
nicholas
you
are
young
and
though
this
shock
may
be
severe
yet
when
it
is
passed
you
will
be
recompensed
i
hope
by
many
years
of
happiness
i
am
not
to
be
deceived
said
richard
look
me
in
the
face
and
say
honestly
if
you
think
me
you
can
not
do
it
i
have
been
smitten
by
a
mortal
illness
and
am
wasting
gradually
away
i
am
dying
i
feel
it
know
it
but
though
it
may
abridge
my
brief
term
of
life
i
will
purchase
present
health
and
spirits
at
any
cost
and
save
alizon
ah
he
exclaimed
putting
his
hand
to
his
heart
with
a
fearful
expression
of
anguish
what
is
the
matter
cried
the
two
gentlemen
greatly
alarmed
and
springing
towards
him
but
the
young
man
could
not
reply
another
and
another
agonising
spasm
shook
his
frame
and
cold
damps
broke
out
upon
his
pallid
brow
showing
the
intensity
of
his
suffering
nicholas
and
sherborne
regarded
each
other
anxiously
as
if
doubtful
how
to
act
shall
i
summon
assistance
said
the
latter
in
a
low
tone
but
softly
as
the
words
were
uttered
they
reached
the
ears
of
richard
rousing
himself
by
a
great
effort
he
said
on
no
account
the
fit
is
over
i
am
glad
it
has
seized
me
now
for
i
shall
not
be
liable
to
a
recurrence
of
it
throughout
the
day
lead
me
to
the
window
the
air
will
presently
revive
me
his
friends
complied
with
the
request
and
placed
him
at
the
open
casement
great
bustle
was
observable
below
and
the
cause
was
soon
manifest
as
the
chief
huntsman
clad
in
green
with
buff
boots
drawn
high
up
on
the
thigh
a
horn
about
his
neck
and
mounted
on
a
strong
black
curtal
rode
forth
from
the
stables
he
was
attended
by
a
noble
bloodhound
and
on
gaining
the
middle
of
the
court
put
his
bugle
to
his
lips
and
blew
a
loud
blithe
call
that
made
the
walls
ring
again
the
summons
was
immediately
answered
by
a
number
of
grooms
and
pages
leading
a
multitude
of
horses
towards
the
upper
end
of
the
court
where
a
gallant
troop
of
dames
nobles
and
gentlemen
all
attired
for
the
chase
awaited
them
and
where
amidst
much
mirth
and
bandying
of
lively
jest
and
compliment
a
general
mounting
took
place
the
ladies
of
course
being
placed
first
on
their
steeds
while
this
was
going
forward
the
hounds
were
brought
from
the
kennel
in
couples
relays
having
been
sent
down
into
the
park
more
than
an
hour
before
and
the
yard
resounded
with
their
joyous
baying
and
the
neighing
of
the
impatient
steeds
by
this
time
also
the
chief
huntsman
had
collected
his
forces
consisting
of
a
dozen
prickers
six
habited
like
himself
in
green
and
six
in
russet
and
all
mounted
on
stout
curtals
those
in
green
were
intended
to
hunt
the
hart
and
those
in
russet
the
the
former
being
provided
with
and
the
latter
with
spears
their
girdles
were
well
lined
with
beef
and
pudding
and
each
of
them
acting
upon
the
advice
of
worthy
master
george
turbervile
had
a
stone
bottle
of
good
wine
at
the
pummel
of
his
saddle
besides
these
there
were
a
whole
host
of
varlets
of
the
chase
on
foot
the
chief
falconer
with
a
hawk
in
her
hood
and
jesses
upon
his
wrist
was
stationed
somewhat
near
the
gateway
and
close
to
him
were
his
attendants
each
having
on
his
fist
a
falcon
gentle
a
barbary
falcon
a
merlin
a
goshawk
or
a
sparrowhawk
thus
all
was
in
readiness
and
hound
hawk
and
man
seemed
equally
impatient
for
the
sport
at
this
juncture
the
door
was
thrown
open
by
faryngton
who
announced
sir
john
finett
it
is
time
master
nicholas
assheton
said
the
master
of
the
ceremonies
i
am
ready
to
attend
you
sir
john
replied
nicholas
taking
a
parchment
from
his
doublet
and
unfolding
it
the
petition
is
well
signed
so
i
see
sir
replied
the
knight
glancing
at
it
will
not
your
friends
come
with
you
most
assuredly
replied
richard
who
had
risen
on
the
appearance
and
he
followed
the
others
down
the
staircase
by
direction
of
the
master
of
the
ceremonies
nearly
a
hundred
of
the
more
important
gentlemen
of
the
county
had
been
got
together
and
this
train
was
subsequently
swelled
to
thrice
the
amount
from
the
accessions
it
received
from
persons
of
inferior
rank
when
its
object
became
known
at
the
head
of
this
large
assemblage
nicholas
was
now
placed
and
accompanied
by
sir
john
finett
who
gave
the
word
to
the
procession
to
follow
them
he
moved
slowly
up
the
court
passing
through
the
brilliant
crowd
of
equestrians
the
procession
halted
at
a
short
distance
from
the
doorway
of
the
great
hall
and
james
who
had
been
waiting
for
its
approach
within
now
came
forth
amid
the
cheers
and
plaudits
of
the
spectators
sir
john
finett
then
led
nicholas
forward
and
the
latter
dropping
on
one
knee
said
may
it
please
your
majesty
i
hold
in
my
hand
a
petition
signed
as
if
you
will
deign
to
cast
your
eyes
over
it
you
will
perceive
by
many
hundreds
of
the
lower
orders
of
your
loving
subjects
in
this
your
county
of
lancaster
representing
that
they
are
debarred
from
lawful
recreations
upon
sunday
after
afternoon
service
and
upon
holidays
and
praying
that
the
restrictions
imposed
in
by
the
earls
of
derby
and
huntingdon
and
by
william
bishop
of
chester
commissioners
to
her
late
highness
elizabeth
of
glorious
memory
your
majesty
predecessor
may
be
withdrawn
and
with
this
he
placed
in
the
king
hands
the
petition
which
was
very
graciously
received
the
complaint
of
our
loving
subjects
in
lancashire
shall
not
pass
unnoticed
sir
said
james
sorry
are
we
to
say
it
but
this
county
of
ours
is
sair
infested
wi
folk
inclining
to
puritanism
and
papistry
baith
of
which
sects
are
adverse
to
the
cause
of
true
religion
honest
mirth
is
not
only
tolerable
but
praiseworthy
and
the
prohibition
of
it
is
likely
to
breed
discontent
and
this
our
enemies
ken
fu
weel
for
when
he
continued
loudly
and
emphatically
when
shall
the
common
people
have
leave
to
exercise
if
not
upon
sundays
and
holidays
seeing
they
must
labour
and
win
their
living
on
all
other
days
your
majesty
speaks
like
king
solomon
himself
observed
nicholas
amid
the
loud
cheering
our
will
and
pleasure
then
is
pursued
james
that
our
good
people
be
not
deprived
of
any
lawful
recreation
that
shall
not
tend
to
a
breach
of
the
laws
or
a
violation
of
the
kirk
but
that
after
the
end
of
divine
service
they
shall
not
be
disturbed
letted
or
discouraged
from
any
lawful
recreation
as
dancing
and
sic
like
either
of
men
or
women
archery
leaping
vaulting
or
ony
ither
harmless
recreation
nor
frae
the
having
of
whitsun
ales
or
morris
dancing
nor
frae
setting
up
of
and
ither
sports
therewith
used
provided
the
same
be
had
in
due
and
convenient
time
without
impediment
or
neglect
of
divine
service
and
our
will
further
is
that
women
shall
have
leave
to
carry
rushes
to
the
church
for
the
decoring
of
it
according
to
auld
custom
but
we
prohibit
all
unlawful
games
on
sundays
as
and
interludes
and
by
the
common
folk
mark
ye
that
sir
playing
at
bowls
the
royal
declaration
was
received
with
loud
and
reiterated
cheers
amidst
which
james
mounted
his
steed
a
large
black
charger
and
rode
out
of
the
court
followed
by
the
whole
cavalcade
trumpets
were
sounded
from
the
battlements
as
he
passed
through
the
gateway
and
shouting
crowds
attended
him
all
the
way
down
the
hill
until
he
entered
the
avenue
leading
to
the
park
at
the
conclusion
of
the
royal
address
the
procession
headed
by
nicholas
immediately
dispersed
and
such
as
meant
to
join
the
chase
set
off
in
quest
of
steeds
foremost
amongst
these
was
the
squire
himself
and
on
approaching
the
stables
he
was
glad
to
find
richard
and
sherborne
already
mounted
the
former
holding
his
horse
by
the
bridle
so
that
he
had
nothing
to
do
but
vault
upon
his
back
there
was
an
impatience
about
richard
very
different
from
his
ordinary
manner
that
surprised
and
startled
him
and
the
expression
of
the
young
countenance
long
afterwards
haunted
him
the
face
was
deathly
pale
except
that
on
either
cheek
burned
a
red
feverish
spot
and
the
eyes
blazed
with
unnatural
light
so
much
was
the
squire
struck
by
his
cousin
looks
that
he
would
have
dissuaded
him
from
going
forth
but
he
saw
from
his
manner
that
the
attempt
would
fail
while
a
significant
gesture
from
his
told
him
he
was
equally
uneasy
scarcely
had
the
principal
nobles
passed
through
the
gateway
than
in
spite
of
all
efforts
to
detain
him
richard
struck
spurs
into
his
horse
and
dashed
amidst
the
cavalcade
creating
great
disorder
and
rousing
the
ire
of
the
earl
of
pembroke
to
whom
the
marshalling
of
the
train
was
entrusted
but
richard
paid
little
heed
to
his
wrath
and
perhaps
did
not
hear
the
angry
expressions
addressed
to
him
for
no
sooner
was
he
outside
the
gate
than
instead
of
pursuing
the
road
down
which
the
king
was
proceeding
and
which
has
been
described
as
hewn
out
of
the
rock
he
struck
into
a
thicket
on
the
right
and
in
defiance
of
all
attempts
to
stop
him
and
at
the
imminent
risk
of
breaking
his
neck
rode
down
the
precipitous
sides
of
the
hill
and
reaching
the
bottom
in
safety
long
before
the
royal
cavalcade
had
attained
the
same
point
took
the
direction
of
the
park
his
friends
watched
him
commence
this
perilous
descent
in
dismay
but
though
much
alarmed
they
were
unable
to
follow
him
poor
lad
i
am
fearful
he
has
lost
his
senses
said
sherborne
he
is
what
the
king
would
call
and
not
long
for
this
world
replied
nicholas
shaking
his
head
chapter
how
king
james
hunted
the
hart
and
the
in
hoghton
park
galloping
on
fast
and
furiously
richard
tracked
a
narrow
path
of
greensward
lying
between
the
tall
trees
composing
the
right
line
of
the
avenue
and
the
adjoining
wood
within
it
grew
many
fine
old
thorns
diverting
him
now
and
then
from
his
course
but
he
still
held
on
until
he
came
within
a
short
distance
of
the
chase
when
his
attention
was
caught
by
a
very
singular
figure
it
was
an
old
man
clad
in
a
robe
of
coarse
brown
serge
with
a
cowl
drawn
partly
over
his
head
a
rope
girdle
like
that
used
by
a
cordelier
sandal
shoon
and
a
venerable
white
beard
descending
to
his
waist
the
features
of
the
hermit
for
such
he
seemed
were
majestic
and
benevolent
seated
on
a
bank
overgrown
with
wild
thyme
beneath
the
shade
of
a
elm
he
appeared
so
intently
engaged
in
the
perusal
of
a
large
open
volume
laid
on
his
knee
that
he
did
not
notice
richard
approach
deeply
interested
however
by
his
appearance
the
young
man
determined
to
address
him
and
reining
in
his
horse
said
respectfully
save
you
father
pass
on
my
son
replied
the
old
man
without
raising
his
eyes
and
hinder
not
my
studies
but
richard
would
not
be
thus
dismissed
perchance
you
are
not
aware
father
he
said
that
the
king
is
about
to
hunt
within
the
park
this
morning
the
royal
cavalcade
has
already
left
hoghton
tower
and
will
be
here
ere
many
minutes
the
king
and
his
retinue
will
pass
along
the
broad
avenue
as
you
should
have
done
and
not
through
this
retired
road
replied
the
hermit
they
will
not
disturb
me
i
would
fain
know
the
subject
of
your
studies
father
inquired
richard
you
are
inquisitive
young
man
returned
the
hermit
looking
up
and
fixing
a
pair
of
keen
grey
eyes
upon
him
but
i
will
satisfy
your
curiosity
if
by
so
doing
i
shall
rid
me
of
your
presence
i
am
reading
the
book
of
fate
richard
uttered
an
exclamation
of
astonishment
and
in
it
your
destiny
is
written
pursued
the
old
man
and
a
sad
one
it
is
consumed
by
a
strange
and
incurable
disease
which
may
at
any
moment
prove
fatal
you
are
scarcely
likely
to
survive
the
next
three
days
in
which
case
she
you
love
better
than
existence
will
perish
miserably
being
adjudged
to
have
destroyed
you
by
witchcraft
it
must
indeed
be
the
book
of
fate
that
tells
you
this
cried
richard
springing
from
his
horse
and
approaching
close
to
the
old
man
may
i
cast
eyes
upon
it
no
my
son
replied
the
old
man
closing
the
volume
you
would
not
comprehend
the
mystic
characters
but
no
eye
except
my
own
must
look
upon
them
what
is
written
will
be
fulfilled
again
i
bid
you
pass
on
i
must
speedily
return
to
my
hermit
cell
in
the
forest
may
i
attend
you
thither
father
asked
richard
to
what
purpose
rejoined
the
old
man
you
have
not
many
hours
of
life
go
then
and
pass
them
in
the
fierce
excitement
of
the
chase
pull
down
the
lordly
stag
slaughter
the
savage
boar
and
as
you
see
the
poor
denizens
of
the
forest
perish
think
that
your
own
end
is
not
far
off
hark
do
you
hear
that
boding
cry
it
is
the
croak
of
a
raven
newly
alighted
in
the
tree
above
us
replied
richard
the
sagacious
bird
will
ever
attend
the
huntsman
in
the
chase
in
the
hope
of
obtaining
a
morsel
when
they
break
up
deer
such
is
the
custom
of
the
bird
i
wot
well
said
the
old
man
but
it
is
not
in
joyous
expectation
of
the
that
he
croaks
now
but
because
his
fell
instinct
informs
him
that
the
is
beneath
him
and
as
if
in
answer
to
the
remark
the
raven
croaked
exultingly
and
rising
from
the
tree
wheeled
in
a
circle
above
them
is
there
no
way
of
averting
my
terrible
destiny
father
cried
richard
despairingly
ay
if
you
choose
to
adopt
it
replied
the
old
man
when
i
said
your
ailment
was
incurable
i
meant
by
ordinary
remedies
but
it
will
yield
to
such
as
i
alone
can
employ
the
malignant
and
fatal
influence
under
which
you
labour
may
be
removed
and
then
your
instant
restoration
to
health
and
vigour
will
follow
but
how
father
how
cried
richard
eagerly
you
have
simply
to
sign
your
name
in
this
book
rejoined
the
hermit
and
what
you
desire
shall
be
done
here
is
a
pen
he
added
taking
one
from
his
girdle
but
the
ink
cried
richard
prick
your
arm
with
your
dagger
and
dip
the
pen
in
the
blood
replied
the
old
man
that
will
suffice
and
what
follows
if
i
sign
demanded
richard
staring
at
him
your
instant
cure
i
will
give
you
to
drink
of
a
wondrous
elixir
but
to
what
do
i
bind
myself
asked
richard
to
serve
me
replied
the
hermit
smiling
but
it
is
a
light
service
and
only
involves
your
appearance
in
this
wood
once
are
you
agreed
i
know
not
replied
the
young
man
distractedly
you
must
make
up
your
mind
speedily
said
the
hermit
for
i
hear
the
approach
of
the
royal
cavalcade
and
as
he
spoke
the
mellow
notes
of
a
bugle
followed
by
the
baying
of
hounds
the
jingling
of
bridles
and
the
trampling
of
a
large
troop
of
horse
were
heard
at
a
short
distance
down
the
avenue
tell
me
who
you
are
cried
richard
i
am
the
hermit
of
the
wood
replied
the
old
man
some
people
call
me
hobthurst
and
some
by
other
names
but
you
will
have
no
difficulty
in
finding
me
out
look
yonder
he
added
pointing
through
the
trees
and
glancing
in
the
direction
indicated
richard
beheld
a
small
party
on
horseback
advancing
across
the
plain
consisting
of
his
father
his
sister
and
alizon
with
their
attendants
is
she
is
she
he
cried
can
you
hesitate
when
it
is
to
save
demanded
the
old
man
heaven
help
me
or
i
am
lost
fervently
ejaculated
richard
gazing
on
high
while
making
the
appeal
when
he
looked
down
again
the
old
man
was
gone
and
he
saw
only
a
large
black
snake
gliding
off
among
the
bushes
muttering
a
few
words
of
thankfulness
for
his
deliverance
he
sprang
upon
his
horse
it
may
be
the
is
right
he
cried
and
that
but
few
hours
of
life
remain
to
me
but
if
so
they
shall
be
employed
in
endeavours
to
vindicate
alizon
and
defeat
the
snares
by
which
she
is
beset
with
this
resolve
he
struck
spurs
into
his
horse
and
set
off
in
the
direction
of
the
little
troop
before
however
he
could
come
up
to
them
their
progress
was
arrested
by
a
pursuivant
who
riding
in
advance
of
the
royal
cavalcade
motioned
them
to
stay
till
it
had
passed
and
the
same
person
also
perceiving
richard
purpose
called
to
him
authoritatively
to
keep
back
the
young
man
might
have
disregarded
the
injunction
but
at
the
same
moment
the
king
himself
appeared
at
the
head
of
the
avenue
and
remarking
richard
who
was
not
more
than
fifty
yards
off
on
the
right
instantly
recognised
him
and
shouted
out
come
hither
young
man
come
hither
thus
baffled
in
his
design
richard
was
forced
to
comply
and
uncovering
his
head
rode
slowly
towards
the
monarch
as
he
approached
james
fixed
on
him
a
glance
of
sharpest
scrutiny
odds
life
ye
hae
been
ganging
a
fine
gait
young
sir
he
cried
ye
maun
be
demented
to
ride
down
a
hill

that
fashion
and
as
if
your
craig
war

come
aff

ye
tired
o

wi
een
strang

their
perdition

the
magnet

eh
he
added
glancing
towards
the
little
group
before
them
gude
faith
the
lass
maun
be
a
potent
witch
to
exercise
sic
influence
and
we
wad
fain
see
the
effect
she
has
on
you
when
near
sir
richard
hoghton
he
called
out
to
the
knight
who
rode
a
few
paces
behind
him
we
pray
you
present
sir
richard
assheton
and
his
daughter
to
us
had
he
dared
so
to
do
richard
would
have
thrown
himself
at
the
feet
but
all
he
could
venture
upon
was
to
say
in
a
low
earnest
tone
do
not
prejudge
alizon
sire
on
my
soul
she
is
innocent
the
king
prejudges
nae
man
replied
james
in
a
tone
of
rebuke
and
like
the
wise
prince
of
israel
whom
it
is
his
wish
to
resemble
he
sees
with
his
ain
een
and
hears
with
his
ain
ears
afore
he
forms
conclusions
that
is
all
i
can
desire
sire
replied
richard
far
be
it
from
me
to
doubt
your
majesty
discrimination
or
love
of
justice
ye
shall
hae
proofs
of
baith
man
afore
we
hae
done
said
james
ah
here
comes
our
host
an
the
twa
lassies
wi
him
she
wi
the
lintwhite
locks
is
your
sister
we
guess
and
the
ither
is
alizon
and
by
our
troth
a
lass
but
satan
is
aye
delusive
we
maun
resist
his
snares
the
party
now
came
on
and
were
formally
presented
to
the
monarch
by
sir
richard
hoghton
sir
richard
assheton
a
gentleman
with
handsome
features
though
somewhat
haughty
in
expression
and
stately
deportment
was
very
graciously
received
and
james
thought
fit
to
pay
a
few
compliments
to
dorothy
covertly
regarding
alizon
the
while
yet
not
neglecting
richard
being
ready
to
intercept
any
signal
that
should
pass
between
them
none
however
was
attempted
for
the
young
man
felt
he
should
only
alarm
and
embarrass
alizon
by
any
attempt
to
caution
her
and
he
therefore
endeavoured
to
assume
an
unconcerned
aspect
and
demeanour
we
hae
heard
the
beauty
of
the
lancashire
lassies
highly
commended
said
the
king
but
faith
it
passes
expectation
twa
lovelier
damsels
than
these
we
never
beheld
baith
are
rare
specimens
o
handiwark
your
majesty
is
pleased
to
be
complimentary
rejoined
sir
richard
assheton
na
sir
richard
returned
james
we
arena
gien
to
flichtering
though
aften
beflummed
oursel
baith
are
bonnie
lassies
we
repeat
an
sae
this
is
alizon
nutter
it
wad
be
ailsie
in
our
ain
scottish
tongue
to
which
your
lancashire
vernacular
closely
approximates
sir
richard
aweel
fair
alizon
he
added
eyeing
her
narrowly
ye
hae
lost
your
mither
we
understand
the
young
girl
was
not
discomposed
by
this
question
but
answered
in
a
firm
melancholy
tone
your
majesty
i
fear
is
too
well
acquainted
with
my
unfortunate
mother
history
aweel
we
winna
deny
having
heard
somewhat
to
her
disadvantage
replied
the
king
but
your
ain
looks
gang
far
to
contradict
the
reports
fair
maid
place
no
faith
in
them
then
sire
replied
alizon
sadly
eh
what
then
you
admit
your
mother
guilt
cried
the
king
sharply
i
neither
admit
it
nor
deny
it
sire
she
replied
it
must
be
for
your
majesty
to
judge
her
weel
answered
muttered
james
but
i
mustna
forget
that
the
deil
himsel
can
quote
scripture
to
serve
his
purpose
but
you
hold
in
abhorrence
the
crime
laid
to
your
mother
charge
eh
he
added
aloud
in
utter
abhorrence
replied
alizon
gude
vera
gude
rejoined
the
king
but
entertaining
this
feeling
how
conies
it
you
screen
so
heinous
an
offender
frae
justice
nae
natural
feeling
should
be
allowed
to
weigh
in
sic
a
case
nor
should
it
sire
with
me
replied
alizon
because
i
believe
my
poor
mother
eternal
welfare
would
be
best
consulted
if
she
underwent
temporal
punishment
neither
is
she
herself
anxious
to
avoid
it
then
why
does
she
keep
out
of
the
way
why
does
she
not
surrender
herself
cried
the
king
because
and
alizon
stopped
because
what
demanded
james
pardon
me
sire
i
must
decline
answering
further
questions
on
the
subject
replied
alizon
whatever
concerns
myself
or
my
mother
alone
i
will
state
freely
but
i
can
not
compromise
others
aha
then
there
are
others
concerned
in
it
cried
james
we
thought
as
much
we
will
interrogate
you
further
hereafter
but
a
word
mair
we
trust
ye
are
devout
and
constant
in
your
religious
exercises
damsel
i
will
answer
for
that
sire
interposed
sir
richard
assheton
alizon
whole
time
is
spent
in
prayer
for
her
unfortunate
mother
if
there
be
a
fault
it
is
that
she
goes
too
far
and
injures
her
health
by
her
zeal
a
gude
fault
that
sir
richard
observed
the
king
approvingly
it
beseems
me
not
to
speak
of
myself
sire
said
alizon
and
i
am
loth
to
do
so
but
i
beseech
your
majesty
to
believe
that
if
my
life
might
be
offered
as
an
atonement
for
my
mother
i
would
freely
yield
it
i
gude
faith
she
staggers
me
in
my
opinion
muttered
james
and
i
maun
look
into
the
matter
mair
closely
the
lass
is
far
different
frae
what
i
imagined
her
but
the
wiles
o
satan
arena
to
be
comprehended
and
he
will
put
on
the
semblance
of
righteousness
when
seeking
to
beguile
the
righteous
aweel
damsel
he
added
aloud
ye
speak
feelingly
and
properly
and
as
a
daughter
should
speak
and
we
respect
your
feelings
provided
they
be
sic
as
ye
represent
them
and
now
dispose
yourselves
for
the
chase
i
must
pray
your
majesty
to
dismiss
me
said
alizon
it
is
a
sight
in
which
at
any
time
i
take
small
pleasure
and
now
it
is
especially
distasteful
to
me
with
your
permission
i
will
proceed
to
hoghton
tower
i
also
crave
your
majesty
leave
to
go
with
her
said
dorothy
i
will
attend
them
interposed
richard
na
you
maun
stay
wi
us
young
sir
cried
the
king
your
gude
father
will
gang
wi
sir
john
finett
he
added
calling
to
the
master
of
the
ceremonies
and
speaking
in
his
ear
see
that
they
be
followed
and
that
a
special
watch
be
kept
over
alizon
and
also
over
this
youth
d
mark
me
in
fact
ower
a
the
assheton
clan
and
now
he
cried
in
a
loud
voice
let
them
blaw
the
strake
the
chief
huntsman
having
placed
the
bugle
to
his
lips
and
blown
a
strike
with
two
winds
a
short
consultation
was
held
between
him
and
james
who
loved
to
display
his
knowledge
as
a
woodsman
and
while
this
was
going
forward
nicholas
and
sherborne
having
come
up
the
squire
dismounted
and
committing
robin
to
his
approached
the
monarch
if
i
may
be
so
bold
as
to
put
in
a
word
my
liege
he
said
i
can
show
you
where
a
hart
of
ten
is
assuredly
harboured
i
viewed
him
as
i
rode
through
the
park
this
morning
and
can
not
therefore
be
mistaken
his
head
is
high
and
well
palmed
great
beamed
and
in
good
proportion
well
burred
and
well
pearled
he
is
stately
in
height
long
and
well
fed
did
you
mark
the
slot
sir
inquired
james
i
did
my
liege
replied
nicholas
and
a
long
slot
it
was
the
toes
great
with
round
short
large
and
the
close
together
i
will
uphold
him
for
a
great
old
hart
as
ever
proffered
and
one
that
shall
shew
your
majesty
rare
sport
and
we
tak
your
word
for
the
matter
sir
said
james
for
ye
as
gude
a
woodman
as
any
we
hae
in
our
dominions
bring
us
to
him
then
will
it
please
your
majesty
to
ride
towards
yon
glade
said
nicholas
and
before
you
reach
it
the
hart
shall
be
roused
james
assenting
to
the
arrangement
nicholas
sprang
upon
his
steed
and
calling
to
the
chief
huntsman
they
galloped
off
together
accompanied
by
the
bloodhound
the
royal
cavalcade
following
somewhat
more
slowly
in
the
same
direction
a
fair
sight
it
was
to
see
that
splendid
company
careering
over
the
plain
their
feathered
caps
and
gay
mantles
glittering
in
the
sun
which
shone
brightly
upon
them
the
morning
was
lovely
giving
promise
that
the
day
when
further
advanced
would
be
intensely
hot
but
at
present
it
was
fresh
and
delightful
and
the
whole
company
exhilarated
by
the
exercise
and
by
animated
conversation
were
in
high
spirits
and
perhaps
amongst
the
huge
party
which
numbered
nearly
three
hundred
persons
one
alone
was
a
prey
to
despair
but
though
richard
assheton
suffered
thus
internally
he
bore
his
anguish
with
spartan
firmness
resolved
if
possible
to
let
no
trace
of
it
be
visible
in
his
features
or
deportment
and
he
so
far
succeeded
in
conquering
himself
that
the
king
who
kept
a
watchful
eye
upon
him
remarked
to
sir
john
finett
as
they
rode
along
that
a
singular
improvement
had
taken
place
in
the
young
man
appearance
the
cavalcade
was
rapidly
approaching
the
glade
at
the
lower
end
of
the
chase
when
the
lively
notes
of
a
horn
were
heard
from
the
adjoining
wood
followed
by
the
deep
baying
of
a
bloodhound
aha
they
have
roused
him
cried
the
king
joyfully
placing
his
own
bugle
to
his
lips
and
sounding
an
answer
upon
this
the
whole
company
halted
in
anxious
expectation
the
hounds
baying
loudly
the
next
moment
a
noble
hart
burst
from
the
wood
whence
he
had
been
driven
by
the
shouts
of
nicholas
and
the
chief
huntsman
both
of
whom
appeared
immediately
afterwards
by
my
faith
a
great
hart
as
ever
was
hunted
exclaimed
the
king
there
boys
there
to
him
to
him
dashing
after
the
flying
hart
the
hounds
made
the
welkin
ring
with
their
cries
many
lovely
damsels
were
there
but
none
thought
of
the
cruelty
of
the
sport
none
sympathised
with
the
noble
animal
they
were
running
to
death
the
cries
of
the
hounds
now
loud
and
ringing
now
deep
and
doling
accompanied
by
the
whooping
of
the
huntsmen
formed
a
stirring
concert
which
found
a
response
in
many
a
gentle
bosom
the
whole
cavalcade
was
spread
widely
about
for
none
were
allowed
to
ride
near
the
king
over
the
plain
they
scoured
fleet
as
the
wind
and
the
hart
seemed
making
for
a
fell
forming
part
of
the
hill
near
the
mansion
but
ere
he
reached
it
the
relays
stationed
within
a
covert
burst
forth
and
turning
him
aside
he
once
more
dashed
fleetly
across
the
broad
expanse
as
if
about
to
return
to
his
old
lair
now
he
was
seen
plunging
into
some
bosky
dell
and
after
being
lost
to
view
for
a
moment
bounding
up
the
opposite
bank
and
stretching
across
a
tract
thickly
covered
with
fern
here
he
gained
upon
the
hounds
who
were
lost
in
the
green
wilderness
and
their
cries
were
hushed
for
a
brief
space
but
anon
they
burst
forth
anew
and
the
pack
were
soon
again
in
full
cry
and
speeding
over
the
open
ground
at
first
the
cavalcade
had
kept
pretty
well
together
but
on
the
return
the
case
was
very
different
and
many
of
the
dames
being
unable
to
keep
up
with
the
hounds
fell
off
and
as
a
natural
consequence
many
of
the
gallants
lingered
behind
too
thus
only
the
keenest
huntsmen
held
on
amongst
these
and
about
fifty
yards
behind
the
king
were
richard
and
nicholas
the
squire
was
right
when
he
predicted
that
the
hart
would
show
them
good
sport
plunging
into
the
wood
the
beast
knocked
up
another
stag
and
took
possession
of
his
lair
but
was
speedily
roused
again
by
nicholas
and
the
chief
huntsman
once
more
he
is
crossing
the
wide
plain
with
hounds
and
huntsmen
after
him
once
more
he
is
turned
by
a
new
relay
but
this
time
he
shapes
his
course
towards
the
woods
skirting
the
darwen
it
is
a
piteous
sight
to
see
him
now
his
coat
black
and
glistening
with
sweat
his
mouth
embossed
with
foam
his
eyes
dull
big
tears
coursing
down
his
cheeks
and
his
noble
head
carried
low
his
end
seems
nigh
for
the
hounds
though
weary
too
redouble
their
energies
and
the
monarch
cheers
them
on
again
the
poor
beast
erects
his
head
if
he
can
only
reach
yon
coppice
he
is
safe
despair
nerves
him
and
with
gigantic
bounds
he
clears
the
intervening
space
and
disappears
beneath
the
branches
quickly
as
the
hounds
come
after
him
they
are
at
fault
he
has
taken
to
the
soil
sire
cried
nicholas
coming
up
to
the
river
to
the
river
you
may
see
by
the
broken
branches
he
has
gone
this
way
forcing
his
way
through
the
wood
james
was
soon
on
the
banks
of
the
darwen
which
here
ran
deep
and
slow
the
hart
was
nowhere
to
be
seen
nor
was
there
any
slot
on
the
further
side
to
denote
that
he
had
gone
forth
it
was
evident
therefore
that
he
had
swam
down
the
stream
at
this
moment
a
shout
was
heard
a
hundred
yards
lower
down
proceeding
from
nicholas
and
riding
in
the
direction
of
the
sound
the
king
found
the
hart
at
bay
on
the
further
side
of
the
stream
and
nearly
up
to
his
haunches
in
the
water
the
king
regarded
him
for
a
moment
anxiously
the
poor
animal
was
now
in
his
last
extremity
but
he
seemed
determined
to
sell
his
life
dearly
he
stood
on
a
bank
projecting
into
the
stream
round
which
the
water
flowed
deeply
and
could
not
be
approached
without
difficulty
and
danger
he
had
already
gored
several
hounds
whose
bleeding
bodies
were
swept
down
the
current
and
though
the
others
bayed
round
him
they
did
not
dare
to
approach
him
and
could
not
get
behind
him
as
a
high
bank
arose
in
his
rear
have
i
your
majesty
permission
to
despatch
him
asked
nicholas
ay
marry
if
you
can
sir
replied
james
but
the
tynes
the
tynes
thou
be
hurt
with
hart
it
brings
thee
to
thy
bier
as
the
auld
ballad
hath
it
and
the
adage
is
true
as
we
oursel
have
seen
nicholas
however
heeded
not
the
caution
but
drawing
his
and
disencumbering
himself
of
his
cloak
he
plunged
into
the
stream
and
with
one
or
two
strokes
reached
the
bank
the
hart
watched
his
approach
as
if
divining
his
purpose
with
a
look
half
menacing
half
reproachful
and
when
he
came
near
dashed
his
antlered
head
at
him
nimbly
eluding
the
blow
which
if
it
had
taken
effect
might
have
proved
serious
nicholas
plunged
his
weapon
into
the
poor
brute
throat
who
instantly
fell
with
a
heavy
splash
into
the
water
weel
stricken
weel
stricken
shouted
james
who
had
witnessed
the
performance
from
the
opposite
bank
but
how
shall
we
get
the
carcase
here
that
is
easily
done
sire
replied
nicholas
and
taking
hold
of
the
horns
he
guided
the
body
to
a
low
bank
a
little
below
where
the
king
stood
as
soon
as
it
was
dragged
ashore
by
the
prickers
james
put
his
bugle
to
his
lips
and
blew
a
mort
a
pryse
was
thrice
sounded
by
nicholas
and
soon
afterwards
the
whole
company
came
flocking
round
the
spot
whooping
the
meanwhile
the
hounds
had
gathered
round
the
fallen
hart
and
were
allowed
to
wreak
their
fury
on
him
by
tearing
his
throat
happily
after
sensibility
was
gone
while
nicholas
again
baring
his
knife
cut
off
the
right
and
presented
it
to
the
king
while
this
ceremony
was
performed
the
varlets
of
the
kennel
having
cut
down
a
great
heap
of
green
branches
and
strewn
them
on
the
ground
laid
the
hart
upon
them
on
his
back
and
then
bore
him
to
an
open
space
in
the
wood
where
he
was
broken
up
by
the
king
who
prided
himself
upon
his
skill
in
all
matters
of
woodcraft
while
this
office
was
in
course
of
execution
a
bowl
of
wine
was
poured
out
for
the
monarch
which
he
took
adverting
as
he
did
so
to
the
common
superstition
that
if
a
huntsman
should
break
up
a
deer
without
drinking
the
venison
would
putrefy
having
drained
the
cup
he
caused
it
to
be
filled
again
and
gave
it
to
nicholas
saying
the
liquor
was
needful
to
him
after
the
drenching
he
had
undergone
james
then
proceeded
with
his
task
and
just
before
he
completed
it
he
was
reminded
by
a
loud
croak
above
him
that
a
raven
was
at
hand
and
accordingly
taking
a
piece
of
gristle
from
the
spoon
of
the
brisket
he
cast
it
on
the
ground
and
the
bird
immediately
pounced
down
upon
it
and
carried
it
off
in
his
huge
beak
after
a
brief
interval
the
seek
was
again
winded
another
hart
was
roused
and
after
a
short
but
swift
chase
pulled
down
by
the
hounds
and
dispatched
with
his
own
hand
by
james
sir
richard
hoghton
then
besought
the
king
to
follow
him
and
led
the
way
to
a
verdant
hollow
surrounded
by
trees
in
which
shady
and
delicious
retreat
preparations
had
been
made
for
a
slight
silvan
repast
upon
a
mossy
bank
beneath
a
tree
a
cushion
was
placed
for
the
king
and
before
it
on
the
sward
was
laid
a
cloth
spread
with
many
dainties
including
neats
tongues
powder
well
and
jambons
of
the
hog
with
sausages
and
savoury
knacks
to
set
men
minds
agog
cold
capons
and
pigeon
pies
close
at
hand
was
a
clear
cold
spring
in
which
numerous
flasks
of
wine
were
immersed
a
few
embers
too
had
been
lighted
on
which
carbonadoes
of
venison
were
prepared
no
great
form
or
ceremony
was
observed
at
the
entertainment
sir
john
finett
and
sir
thomas
hoghton
were
in
close
attendance
upon
the
monarch
and
ministered
to
his
wants
but
several
of
the
nobles
and
gentlemen
stretched
themselves
on
the
sward
and
addressed
themselves
to
the
viands
set
before
them
by
the
pages
none
of
the
dames
dismounted
and
few
could
be
prevailed
upon
to
take
any
refreshment
besides
the
flasks
of
wine
there
were
two
barrels
of
ale
in
a
small
cart
drawn
by
a
mule
both
of
which
were
broached
the
whole
scene
was
picturesque
and
pleasing
and
well
calculated
to
gratify
one
so
fond
of
silvan
sports
as
the
monarch
for
whom
it
was
provided
in
the
midst
of
all
this
tranquillity
and
enjoyment
an
incident
occurred
which
interrupted
it
as
completely
as
if
a
had
suddenly
come
on
just
when
the
mirth
was
at
the
highest
and
when
the
flowing
cup
was
at
many
a
lip
a
tremendous
bellowing
followed
by
the
crashing
of
branches
was
heard
in
the
adjoining
thicket
all
started
to
their
feet
at
the
appalling
sound
and
the
king
himself
turned
pale
what
in
heaven
name
can
it
be
sir
richard
he
inquired
it
must
be
a
drove
of
wild
cattle
replied
the
baronet
trembling
wild
cattle
ejaculated
james
in
great
alarm
and
sae
near
us
zounds
we
shall
be
trampled
and
gored
to
death
by
these
bulls
of
basan
sir
richard
ye
are
a
fause
traitor
thus
to
endanger
the
safety
o
your
sovereign
and
ye
shall
answer
for
it
if
harm
come
o
it
i
am
unable
to
account
for
it
sire
stammered
the
frightened
baronet
i
gave
special
directions
to
the
prickers
to
drive
the
beasts
away
ye
shouldna
keep
sic
deevils
i
your
park
man
cried
the
monarch
eh
what
that
amidst
all
this
consternation
and
confusion
the
bellowing
was
redoubled
and
the
crashing
of
branches
drew
nearer
and
nearer
and
nicholas
assheton
rushed
forward
with
the
king
horse
saying
mount
sire
mount
and
away
but
james
was
so
much
alarmed
that
his
limbs
refused
to
perform
their
office
and
he
was
unable
to
put
foot
in
the
stirrup
seeing
his
condition
nicholas
cried
out
pardon
my
liege
but
at
a
moment
of
peril
like
the
present
one
must
not
stand
on
ceremony
so
saying
he
took
the
king
round
the
waist
and
placed
him
on
his
steed
at
this
juncture
a
loud
cry
was
heard
and
a
man
in
extremity
of
terror
issued
from
the
wood
and
dashed
towards
the
hollow
close
on
his
heels
came
the
drove
of
wild
cattle
and
just
as
he
gained
the
very
verge
of
the
descent
the
foremost
of
the
herd
overtook
him
and
lowering
his
curled
head
caught
him
on
the
points
of
his
horns
and
threw
him
forwards
to
such
a
distance
that
he
alighted
with
a
heavy
crash
almost
at
the
king
feet
satisfied
apparently
with
their
vengeance
or
alarmed
by
the
numerous
assemblage
the
drove
instantly
turned
tail
and
were
pursued
into
the
depths
of
the
forest
by
the
prickers
having
recovered
his
composure
james
bade
some
of
the
attendants
raise
the
poor
wretch
who
was
lying
groaning
upon
the
ground
evidently
so
much
injured
as
to
be
unable
to
move
without
assistance
his
garb
was
that
of
a
forester
and
his
bulk
for
he
was
stoutly
and
squarely
built
had
contributed
no
doubt
to
the
severity
of
the
fall
when
he
was
lifted
from
the
ground
nicholas
instantly
recognised
in
his
blackened
and
distorted
features
those
of
christopher
demdike
what
he
exclaimed
rushing
towards
him
is
it
thou
villain
the
sufferer
only
replied
by
a
look
of
intense
malignity
eh
what
d
ken
wha
it
is
demanded
james
by
my
saul
i
fear
the
puir
fellow
has
maist
of
his
banes
broken
no
great
matter
if
they
be
replied
nicholas
and
it
may
save
the
application
of
torture
in
case
your
majesty
desires
to
put
any
question
to
him
chance
has
most
strangely
thrown
into
your
hands
one
of
the
most
heinous
offenders
in
the
kingdom
who
has
long
escaped
justice
but
who
will
at
length
meet
the
punishment
of
his
crimes
the
villain
is
christopher
demdike
son
of
the
foul
hag
who
perished
in
the
flames
on
the
summit
of
pendle
hill
and
captain
of
a
band
of
robbers
what
is
the
knave
a
warlock
and
a
riever
demanded
james
regarding
demdike
with
abhorrence
mingled
with
alarm
both
sire
replied
nicholas
and
an
assassin
to
boot
he
is
a
diabolical
villain
let
him
be
taken
to
hoghton
tower
and
kept
in
some
strong
and
secure
place
till
we
have
leisure
to
examine
him
said
james
and
see
that
he
be
visited
by
some
skilful
chirurgeon
for
we
wadna
hae
him
dee
and
sae
rob
the
woodie
demdike
who
appeared
to
be
in
great
agony
now
forced
himself
to
speak
i
can
make
important
disclosures
to
your
majesty
he
said
in
hoarse
and
broken
tones
if
you
will
hear
them
i
am
not
the
only
offender
who
has
escaped
from
justice
he
added
glancing
vindictively
at
nicholas
there
is
another
a
notorious
witch
and
murderess
who
is
still
screened
from
justice
i
can
reveal
her
your
majesty
will
not
give
heed
to
such
a
villain
fabrications
said
nicholas
are
they
fabrications
sir
rejoined
james
somewhat
sharply
we
maun
hear
and
judge
the
snake
though
scotched
will
still
bite
it
seems
we
hae
hangit
a
highland
cateran
without
trial
afore
this
and
we
may
be
tempted
to
tak
the
law
into
our
ain
hands
again
bear
the
villain
hence
see
he
be
disposed
of
as
already
directed
and
take
good
care
he
is
strictly
guarded
and
now
gie
us
a
crossbow
sir
richard
hoghton
and
bid
the
prickers
drive
the
deer
afore
us
for
we
wad
try
our
skill
as
a
marksman
and
while
demdike
was
placed
on
the
litter
of
green
boughs
which
had
recently
sustained
a
nobler
burthen
in
the
fallen
hart
and
in
this
sort
was
conveyed
to
hoghton
tower
james
rode
with
his
retinue
towards
a
long
glade
where
receiving
a
crossbow
from
the
huntsman
he
took
up
a
favourable
position
behind
a
large
oak
and
several
herds
of
deer
being
driven
before
him
he
selected
his
quarries
and
deliberately
took
aim
at
them
contriving
in
the
course
of
an
hour
to
bring
down
four
fat
bucks
and
to
maim
as
many
others
which
were
pulled
down
by
the
hounds
and
with
this
slaughter
he
was
content
sir
richard
hoghton
then
informed
his
majesty
that
a
huge
boar
which
in
sporting
phrase
had
left
the
sounder
five
years
had
broken
into
the
park
the
night
before
and
had
been
routing
amongst
the
fern
the
age
and
size
of
the
animal
were
known
by
the
print
of
the
feet
the
toes
being
round
and
thick
the
edge
of
the
hoof
worn
and
blunt
the
heel
large
and
the
guards
or
great
and
open
from
all
which
appearances
it
was
adjudged
by
the
baronet
to
be
a
great
old
boar
not
to
be
refused
james
at
once
agreed
to
hunt
him
and
the
hounds
being
taken
away
six
couples
of
magnificent
mastiffs
of
the
lancashire
breed
were
brought
forward
and
the
monarch
under
the
guidance
of
sir
richard
hoghton
and
the
chief
huntsman
repaired
to
an
adjoining
thicket
in
which
the
boar
fed
and
couched
on
arriving
near
his
den
a
was
given
to
the
king
and
the
prickers
advancing
into
the
wood
presently
afterwards
reared
the
enormous
brute
sallying
forth
and
freaming
furiously
he
was
instantly
assailed
by
the
mastiffs
but
notwithstanding
the
number
of
his
assailants
he
made
light
of
them
shaking
them
from
his
bristly
hide
crushing
them
beneath
his
horny
feet
thrusting
at
them
with
his
sharpened
tusks
and
committing
terrible
devastation
among
them
repeated
charges
were
made
upon
the
savage
animal
by
james
but
it
was
next
to
impossible
to
get
a
blow
at
him
for
some
time
and
when
at
length
the
monarch
made
the
attempt
he
struck
too
low
and
hit
him
on
the
snout
upon
which
the
infuriated
boar
finding
himself
wounded
sprang
towards
the
horse
and
ripped
him
open
with
his
tusks
the
noble
charger
instantly
rolled
over
on
his
side
exposing
the
royal
huntsman
to
the
fury
of
his
merciless
assailant
whose
tusks
must
have
ploughed
his
flesh
if
at
this
moment
a
young
man
had
not
ridden
forward
and
at
the
greatest
personal
risk
approached
the
boar
and
striking
straight
downwards
cleft
the
heart
of
the
fierce
brute
with
his
spear
meanwhile
the
king
having
been
disengaged
by
the
prickers
from
his
wounded
steed
which
was
instantly
put
out
of
its
agony
by
the
sword
of
the
chief
huntsman
looked
for
his
deliverer
and
discovering
him
to
be
richard
assheton
was
loud
in
his
expressions
of
gratitude

james

added

a
magnificent
sapphire
ring
from
his
finger
and
if
you
should
ever
need
our
aid

it
to
us
as

token
richard
took

gift
and

graciously
extended
to
him

this
time

horse

been
provided
for

monarch

suspended
upon

borne
on

justice

especially
to
the
beef
which
he
found
so
excellent
that
the
carver
had
to
help
him
for
the
second
time
sir
richard
hoghton
ventured
to
express
his
gratification
that
his
majesty
found
the
meat
good
indeed
it
is
generally
admitted
he
said
that
our
lancashire
beef
is

fed
and

james
as
he
swallowed
the
last
juicy

sir

he
asked
with
eyes
evidently
twinkling
with
a
premeditated
jest

the
host
somewhat
surprised
this
sire

james
taking
the

sewer
who

honourable

he
added
touching
the
meat
with
the
flat
of
the
long
blade
as
if

the
sword
on
the
back
of
a

a

master
richard
assheton
all
the
nobles
at
the
table
laughed
loudly
at
the
monarch
jest
and
as
it
was
soon
past
down
to
those
at
the
lower
table
the
hall
resounded
with
laughter
in
which
page
and
attendant
of
every
degree
joined
to
the
great
satisfaction
of
the
originator
of
the
merriment
my
dear
dad
and
gossip

in
unwonted
good
spirits
observed
the
duke
of
buckingham
an
wi
gude

steenie
replied
the
king
for

when

replied
buckingham
somewhat
drily

archie
armstrong
in

tone
to
nicholas

made
any
further
inquiries
about
the

inquired
buckingham
renewing
the
conversation
whist
steenie
whist
cried
james
didna

yoursel
this
morning
he
added
in
a
low
tone
ah
i

aweel
i

conferred
wi
her
an
am
sair

i
the

she
is
a
lassie
as
ony
i
the
realm
and
answers
decorously
and
doucely
sooth
to
say
her
looks
and
manners
are
mightily
in
her
favour
then
you
mean
to
dismiss
the
matter
without
further
investigation
observed
buckingham
i
always
thought
your
majesty
delighted
to
exercise
your
sagacity
in
detecting
the
illusions
practised
by
satan
and
his
worshippers
an
sae
we
do
replied
james
but
bend
your
bonnie
head
this
way
till
we
whisper
in
your
ear
we
hae
a
device
for
finding
it
a
out
which

and
when
you

it
you
will
applaud
your
dear
dad
wisdom
and
perfit
maistery
o
the
haill
science

i
would
your
majesty

replied
buckingham
with
contempt
i
might
make
it
more
certain
of
success
na
na
we
shanna
let
the
cat
out
of
the
bag
just
yet
returned
the
king
we
mean
it
as
a
surprise
to
ye
a
then
whatever
be
the
result
it
is
certain
to
answer
the
effect
intended
observed
the
duke
gae
wa
ye
are
ever
sceptical
steenie
ever
misdoubting
your
ain
dear
dad
and
gossip
rejoined
james
but
ye
shall
find
we
haena
earned
the
title
o
the
british
solomon
for
naething
soon
after
this
the
king
arose
and
was
ushered
to
his
apartments
by
sir
richard
hoghton
with
the
same
ceremony
as
had
been
observed
on
his
entrance
he
was
followed
by
all
the
nobles
and
nicholas
and
the
others
being
released
from
their
duties
repaired
to
the
lower
end
of
the
hall
to
dine
the
revel
was
now
sufficiently
boisterous
for
as
the
dames
had
departed
at
the
same
time
as
the
monarch
all
restraint
was
cast
aside
the
flowed
freely
and
the
rafters
rang
with
laughter
under
ordinary
circumstances
richard
would
have
shrunk
from
such
a
scene
but
he
had
now
a
part
to
play
and
therefore
essayed
to
laugh
at
each
jest
and
to
appear
as
reckless
as
his
neighbours
he
was
glad
however
when
the
signal
for
general
dispersion
was
given
for
though
sir
richard
hoghton
was
unwilling
to
stint
his
guests
he
was
fearful
if
they
sat
too
long
over
their
wine
some
disturbances
might
ensue
and
indeed
when
the
revellers
came
forth
and
dispersed
within
the
base
court
their
flushed
cheeks
loud
voices
and
unsteady
gait
showed
that
their
potations
had
already
been
deep
enough
meanwhile
quite
as
much
mirth
was
taking
place
out
of
doors
as
had
occurred
within
the
as
soon
as
the
king
sat
down
to
dinner
according
to
promise
the
gates
were
thrown
open
and
the
crowd
outside
admitted
the
huge
roast
was
then
taken
down
carved
and
distributed
among
them
the
only
difficulty
experienced
being
in
regard
to
trenchers
and
various
and
extraordinary
were
the
contrivances
resorted
to
to
supply
the
deficiency
this
circumstance
however
served
to
heighten
the
fun
and
as
several
casks
of
stout
ale
were
broached
at
the
same
time
universal
hilarity
prevailed
still
in
the
midst
of
so
vast
a
concourse
many
component
parts
of
which
had
now
began
to
experience
the
effects
of
the
potent
liquor
some
little
manifestation
of
disorder
might
naturally
be
expected
but
all
such
was
speedily
quelled
by
the
yeomen
of
the
guard
and
other
officials
appointed
for
the
purpose
and
amidst
the
uproar
and
confusion
harmony
generally
prevailed
while
elbowing
his
way
through
the
crowd
nicholas
felt
his
sleeve
plucked
and
turning
perceived
nance
redferne
who
signed
him
to
follow
her
and
there
was
something
in
her
manner
that
left
him
no
alternative
but
compliance
nance
passed
on
rapidly
and
entered
the
doorway
of
a
building
where
it
might
be
supposed
they
would
be
free
from
interruption
what
do
you
want
with
me
nance
asked
the
squire
somewhat
impatiently
i
must
beg

observe
that

not
be
troubled
further

and

i

matter

to

said
nicholas
apparently
it
can
not
be
in
better
hands
but
are
you
aware
that
christopher
demdike

a
prisoner
here
in
hoghton

rejoined
nicholas
i

now
perfect
reliance
upon

but
when

i
see
you
again
that
depends
upon
circumstances
she
replied
may

my

maun

guided
by
those
of
others
boh
when
next
yo
see
me
you
win
ha
to

and
without
waiting
an
answer
she
rushed
out
of
the
doorway
and
mingling
with
the
crowd
was
instantly
lost
to
view
while
nicholas
full
of
the
intelligence
he
had
received
betook
himself
slowly
to
his
lodgings
scarcely
were
they
gone
when
a
door
which
had
been
standing
ajar
near
them
was
opened
wide
and
disclosed
the
keen
visage
of
master
potts
here
a
pretty
plot
hatching
here
a
nice
discovery
i
have
made
soliloquised
the
attorney
the
whole
demdike
family
with
the
exception
of
the
old
witch
herself
whom
i
saw
burnt
on
pendle
hill
are
at
hoghton
tower
this
shall
be
made
known
to
the
king
i
have
nicholas
assheton
arrested
at
once
and
the
woman
with
him
whom
i
recognise
as
nance
redferne
it
will
be
a
wonderful
stroke
and
will
raise
me
highly
in
his
majesty
estimation
yet
stay
will
not
this
interfere
with
my
other
plans
with
jennet
let
me
reflect
i
must
go
cautiously
to
work
besides
if
i
cause
nicholas
to
be
arrested
nance
will
escape
and
then
i
shall
have
no
clue
to
the
others
no
no
i
must
watch
nicholas
closely
and
take
upon
myself
all
the
credit
of
the
discovery
perhaps
through
jennet
i
may
be
able
to
detect
their
disguises
at
all
events
i
will
keep
a
sharp
affairs
are
now
drawing
to
a
close
and
i
have
only
like
a
wary
and
experienced
fowler
to
lay
my
nets
cleverly
to
catch
the
whole
covey
and
with
these
ruminations
he
likewise
went
forth
into
the
base
court
the
rest
of
the
day
was
one
round
of
festivity
and
enjoyment
in
which
all
classes
participated
there
were
trials
of
skill
and
strength
running
wrestling
and
with
an
infinite
variety
of
country
games
and
shows
towards
five
a
decked
with
flowers
and
ribbons
and
bestridden
by
men
bearing
garlands
was
drawn
up
in
front
of
the
central
building
of
the
tower
in
an
open
window
of
which
sat
james
a
spectator
of
the
different
pastimes
going
forward
and
several
lively
dances
were
executed
by
a
troop
of
male
and
female
accompanied
by
a
tabor
and
pipe
but
though
this
show
was
sufficiently
attractive
it
lacked
the
spirit
of
that
performed
at
whalley
while
the
character
of
maid
marian
which
then
found
so
charming
a
representative
in
alizon
was
now
personated
by
a
man
and
if
nicholas
assheton
who
was
amongst
the
bystanders
was
not
deceived
that
man
was
jem
device
enraged
by
this
discovery
the
squire
was
about
to
seize
the
ruffian
but
calling
to
mind
nance
counsel
he
refrained
and
jem
if
it
indeed
were
he
retired
with
a
largess
bestowed
by
the
royal
hand
as
a
reward
for
his
uncouth
gambols
the
and
having
disappeared
another
drollery
was
exhibited
called
the
fool
and
his
five
sons
the
names
of
the
hopeful
offspring
of
the
sapient
sire
being
pickle
herring
blue
hose
pepper
hose
ginger
hose
and
jack
allspice
the
humour
of
this
piece
though
not
particularly
refined
seemed
to
be
appreciated
by
the
audience
generally
as
well
as
by
the
monarch
who
laughed
heartily
at
its
coarse
buffoonery
next
followed
the
plough
and
sword
dance
the
principal
actors
being
a
number
of
grotesque
figures
armed
with
swords
some
of
whom
were
yoked
to
a
plough
on
which
sat
a
piper
playing
lustily
while
dragged
along
the
plough
was
guided
by
a
man
clothed
in
a
with
a
fur
cap
on
his
head
and
a
long
tail
like
that
of
a
lion
dangling
behind
him
in
this
hirsute
personage
who
was
intended
to
represent
the
hobthurst
nicholas
again
detected
jem
device
and
again
was
strongly
tempted
to
disobey
nance
injunctions
and
denounce
him
the
rather
that
he
recognised
in
an
attendant
female
in
a
fantastic
dress
the
ruffian
mother
elizabeth
but
he
once
more
desisted
as
soon
as
the
mummers
arrived
in
front
of
the
king
the
dance
began
with
their
swords
held
upright
the
party
took
hands
and
wheeled
rapidly
round
the
plough
keeping
time
to
a
merry
measure
played
by
the
piper
who
still
maintained
his
seat
suddenly
the
ring
was
enlarged
to
double
its
former
size
each
man
extending
his
sword
to
his
neighbour
who
took
hold
of
the
point
after
which
an
hexagonal
figure
was
formed
all
the
blades
being
brought
together
the
swords
were
then
quickly
withdrawn
flashing
like
sunbeams
and
a
four
square
figure
was
presented
the
dancers
vaulting
actively
over
each
other
heads
other
variations
succeeded
not
necessary
to
be
specified
and
the
sport
concluded
by
a
general
clashing
of
swords
intended
to
represent
a
melee
meanwhile
nicholas
had
been
joined
by
richard
assheton
and
the
latter
was
not
long
in
detecting
the
two
devices
through
their
disguises
on
making
this
discovery
he
mentioned
it
to
the
squire
and
was
surprised
to
find
him
already
aware
of
the
circumstance
and
not
less
astonished
when
he
was
advised
to
let
them
alone
the
squire
adding
he
was
unable
at
that
time
to
give
his
reasons
for
such
counsel
but
being
good
and
conclusive
richard
would
be
satisfied
of
their
propriety
hereafter
the
young
man
however
thought
otherwise
and
notwithstanding
his
relative
attempts
to
dissuade
him
announced
his
intention
of
causing
the
parties
to
be
arrested
at
once
and
with
this
design
he
went
in
search
of
an
officer
of
the
guard
that
the
capture
might
be
effected
without
disturbance
but
the
throng
was
so
close
round
the
dancers
that
he
could
not
pierce
it
and
being
compelled
to
return
and
take
another
course
he
got
nearer
to
the
mazy
ring
and
was
unceremoniously
pushed
aside
by
the
mummers
at
this
moment
both
his
arms
were
forcibly
grasped
and
a
deep
voice
on
the
right
whispered
in
his
ear
meddle
not
with
us
and
we
will
not
meddle
with
you
while
similar
counsel
was
given
him
in
other
equally
menacing
tones
though
in
a
different
key
on
the
left
richard
would
have
shaken
off
his
assailants
and
seized
them
in
his
turn
but
power
to
do
so
was
wanting
to
him
for
the
moment
he
was
deprived
of
speech
and
motion
but
while
thus
situated
he
felt
that
the
sapphire
ring
given
him
by
the
king
was
snatched
from
his
finger
by
the
first
speaker
whom
he
knew
to
be
jem
device
while
a
fearful
spell
was
muttered
over
him
by
elizabeth
as
this
occurred
at
the
time
when
the
rattling
of
the
swords
engaged
the
whole
attention
of
the
spectators
no
one
noticed
what
was
going
forward
except
nicholas
and
before
he
could
get
up
to
the
young
man
the
two
miscreants
were
gone
nor
could
any
one
tell
what
had
become
of
them
have
the
wretches
done
you
a
mischief
asked
the
squire
in
a
low
tone
of
richard
they
have
stolen
the
king
ring
which
i
meant
to
use
in
behalf
replied
the
young
man
who
by
this
time
had
recovered
his
speech
that
is
unlucky
indeed
said
nicholas
but
we
can
defeat
any
ill
design
they
may
intend
by
acquainting
sir
john
finett
with
the
circumstance
let
them
be
said
a
voice
in
his
ear
the
time
is
not
yet
come
the
squire
did
not
look
round
for
he
well
knew
that
the
caution
proceeded
from
nance
redferne
and
accordingly
he
observed
to
richard
tarry
awhile
and
you
will
be
amply
avenged
and
with
this
assurance
the
young
man
was
fain
to
be
content
just
then
a
trumpet
was
sounded
and
a
herald
stationed
on
the
summit
of
the
broad
flight
of
steps
leading
to
the
great
hall
proclaimed
in
a
loud
voice
that
a
was
about
to
take
place
between
archie
armstrong
jester
to
his
most
gracious
majesty
and
davy
droman
who
filled
the
same
honourable
office
to
his
grace
the
duke
of
buckingham
and
that
a
pair
of
chopines
would
be
the
reward
of
the
successful
combatant
this
announcement
was
received
with
cheers
and
preparations
were
instantly
made
for
the
mock
tourney
a
large
circle
being
formed
by
the
yeomen
of
the
guard
with
an
alley
leading
to
it
on
either
side
the
two
combatants
mounted
on
rode
into
the
ring
both
were
armed
to
the
teeth
each
having
a
braced
around
him
in
lieu
of
a
breastplate
a
brass
porringer
on
his
head
a
large
pewter
platter
instead
of
a
buckler
and
a
spit
with
a
bung
at
the
point
to
prevent
mischief
in
place
of
a
lance
the
duke
jester
was
an
obese
little
fellow
and
his
appearance
in
this
warlike
gear
was
so
eminently
ridiculous
that
it
provoked
roars
of
laughter
while
archie
was
scarcely
less
ridiculous
after
curveting
round
the
arena
in
imitation
of
knights
of
chivalry
and
performing
their
careers
their
prankers
their
false
trots
their
smooth
ambles
and
canterbury
paces
the
two
champions
took
up
a
position
opposite
each
other
with
difficulty
as
it
seemed
reining
in
their
pawing
chargers
and
awaiting
the
signal
of
attack
to
be
given
by
sir
john
finett
the
judge
of
the
tournament
this
was
not
long
delayed
and
the
laissez
aller
being
pronounced
the
preux
chevaliers
started
forward
with
so
much
fury
and
so
little
discretion
that
meeting
with
a
tremendous
shock
and
butting
against
each
other
like
two
rams
both
were
thrown
violently
backwards
exhibiting
amid
the
shouts
of
the
spectators
their
heels
no
longer
hidden
by
the
trappings
of
their
steeds
kicking
in
the
air
encumbered
as
they
were
some
little
time
elapsed
before
they
could
regain
their
feet
and
their
lances
having
been
removed
in
the
mean
time
by
order
of
sir
john
finett
as
being
weapons
of
too
dangerous
a
description
for
such
truculent
combatants
they
attacked
each
other
with
their
broad
lathen
daggers
dealing
sounding
blows
upon
helm
habergeon
and
shield
but
doing
little
personal
mischief
the
strife
raged
furiously
for
some
time
and
as
the
champions
appeared
pretty
well
matched
it
was
not
easy
to
say
how
it
would
terminate
when
chance
seemed
to
decide
in
favour
of
davy
droman
for
in
dealing
a
heavier
blow
than
usual
archie
dagger
snapped
in
twain
leaving
him
at
the
mercy
of
his
opponent
on
this
the
doughty
davy
crowing
lustily
like
chanticleer
called
upon
him
to
yield
but
archie
was
so
wroth
at
his
misadventure
that
instead
of
complying
he
sprang
forward
and
with
the
hilt
of
his
broken
weapon
dealt
his
elated
opponent
a
severe
blow
on
the
side
of
the
head
not
only
knocking
off
the
porringer
but
stretching
him
on
the
ground
beside
it
the
punishment
he
had
received
was
enough
for
poor
davy
he
made
no
attempt
to
rise
and
archie
crowing
in
his
turn
trampling
upon
the
body
of
his
prostrate
foe
and
then
capering
joyously
round
it
was
declared
the
victor
and
received
the
gilt
chopines
from
the
judge
amidst
the
laughter
and
acclamations
of
the
beholders
with
this
the
public
sports
concluded
and
as
evening
was
drawing
on
apace
such
of
the
guests
as
were
not
invited
to
pass
the
night
within
the
tower
took
their
departure
while
shortly
afterwards
supper
being
served
in
the
on
a
scale
of
profusion
and
magnificence
quite
equal
to
the
earlier
repast
the
king
and
the
whole
of
his
train
sat
down
to
it
chapter
evening
entertainments
other
amusements
were
reserved
for
the
evening
while
revelry
was
again
held
in
the
great
hall
while
the
tables
groaned
for
the
third
time
since
morning
with
good
cheer
and
the
ruby
wine
which
seemed
to
gush
from
inexhaustible
fountains
mantled
in
the
silver
flagons
while
seneschal
sewer
and
pantler
with
the
yeomen
of
the
buttery
and
kitchen
were
again
actively
engaged
in
their
vocations
while
of
the
three
hundred
guests
more
than
half
as
if
insatiate
again
vied
with
each
other
in
prowess
with
the
trencher
and
the
goblet
while
in
the
words
of
old
taylor
the
water
poet
but
who
was
no
and
who
thus
sang
of
the
hospitality
of
the
men
of
manchester
in
the
early
part
of
the
seventeenth
century
they
had
roast
boil
bak
too
too
much
white
claret
sack
nothing
they
thought
too
heavy
or
too
hot
can
follow
can
and
pot
succeeded
pot
during
this
time
preparations
were
making
for
fresh
entertainments
out
of
doors
the
gardens
at
hoghton
tower
though
necessarily
confined
in
space
owing
to
their
situation
on
the
brow
of
a
hill
were
beautifully
laid
out
and
commanded
from
their
balustred
terraces
magnificent
views
of
the
surrounding
country
below
them
lay
the
park
skirted
by
the
silvery
darwen
with
the
fair
village
of
immediately
beyond
it
the
proud
town
of
preston
further
on
and
the
nese
point
rising
majestically
in
the
distance
the
principal
garden
constituted
a
square
and
was
divided
with
mathematical
precision
according
to
the
formal
taste
of
the
time
into
smaller
squares
with
a
broad
gravel
walk
at
each
angle
these
plots
were
arranged
in
various
figures
and
devices
such
as
the
the
the
trefoil
the
lozenge
the
fret
the
diamond
the
crossbow
and
the
oval
all
very
elaborate
and
intricate
in
design
besides
these
knots
as
they
were
termed
there
were
labyrinths
and
clipped
walks
and
that
indispensable
requisite
to
a
garden
at
the
period
a
maze
in
the
centre
was
a
grassy
eminence
surmounted
by
a
pavilion
in
front
of
which
spread
a
of
smoothest
turf
ordinarily
used
as
a
at
the
lower
end
of
this
a
temporary
stage
was
erected
for
the
masque
about
to
be
represented
before
the
king
torches
were
kindled
and
numerous
lamps
burned
in
the
branches
of
the
adjoining
trees
but
they
were
scarcely
needed
for
the
moon
being
at
the
full
the
glorious
effulgence
shed
by
her
upon
the
scene
rendered
all
other
light
pale
and
ineffectual
after
supper
at
which
the
drinking
was
deeper
than
at
dinner
the
whole
of
the
revellers
repaired
to
the
garden
full
of
frolic
and
merriment
and
for
any
diversion
in
store
for
them
the
king
was
conducted
to
the
by
his
host
preceded
by
a
crowd
of
attendants
bearing
odoriferous
torches
but
the
royal
gait
being
somewhat
unsteady
the
aid
of
sir
gilbert
hoghton
arm
was
required
to
keep
the
monarch
from
stumbling
the
rest
of
the
bacchanalians
followed
and
elated
as
they
were
it
will
not
be
wondered
that
they
put
very
little
restraint
upon
themselves
but
shouted
sang
danced
and
indulged
in
all
kinds
of
licence
opposite
the
stage
prepared
for
the
masquers
a
platform
had
been
reared
in
front
of
which
was
a
chair
for
the
king
with
seats
for
the
nobles
and
principal
guests
behind
it
the
sides
were
hung
with
curtains
of
crimson
velvet
fringed
with
gold
the
roof
decorated
like
a
canopy
so
that
it
had
a
very
magnificent
effect
james
lolled
back
in
his
chair
and
jested
loudly
and
rather
indecorously
with
the
various
personages
as
they
took
their
places
around
him
in
less
than
five
minutes
the
whole
of
the
green
was
filled
with
revellers
and
great
was
the
pushing
and
jostling
the
laughing
and
screaming
that
ensued
among
them
silence
was
then
enjoined
by
sir
john
finett
who
had
stationed
himself
on
the
steps
of
the
stage
and
at
this
command
the
assemblage
became
comparatively
quiet
though
now
and
then
a
titter
or
a
smothered
scream
would
break
out
amid
this
silence
the
king
voice
could
be
distinctly
heard
and
his
coarse
jests
reached
the
ears
of
all
the
astonished
audience
provoking
many
a
severe
comment
from
the
elders
and
much
secret
laughter
from
the
juniors
the
masque
began
two
tutelar
deities
appeared
on
the
stage
they
were
followed
by
a
band
of
foresters
clad
in
lincoln
green
with
bows
at
their
backs
the
first
deity
wore
a
white
linen
tunic
with
hose
and
red
buskins
and
had
a
purple
taffeta
mantle
over
his
shoulders
in
his
hand
he
held
a
palm
branch
and
a
garland
of
the
same
leaves
was
woven
round
his
brow
the
second
household
god
was
a
big
brawny
varlet
wild
and
shaggy
in
appearance
being
clothed
in
the
skins
of
beasts
with
sandals
of
untanned
cowhide
on
his
head
was
a
garland
of
oak
leaves
and
from
his
neck
hung
a
horn
he
was
armed
with
a
and
and
attended
by
a
large
lancashire
mastiff
advancing
to
the
front
of
the
stage
the
foremost
personage
thus
addressed
the
monarch
this
day
great
king
for
government
admired
which
these
thy
subjects
have
so
much
desired

be
kept
holy
in
their
heart
best
treasure
and
vow
to
james
as
is
this
month
to
cæsar
and
now
the
landlord
of
this
ancient
tower
thrice
fortunate
to
see
this
happy
hour
whose
trembling
heart
thy
presence
sets
on
fire
unto
this
house
the
heart
of
all
our
shire
does
bid
thee
cordial
welcome
and
would
speak
it
in
higher
notes
but
extreme
joy
doth
break
it
he
makes
his
guests
most
welcome
in
his
eyes
love
tears
do
sit
not
he
that
shouts
and
cries
and
we
the
antique
guardians
of
this
place
i
of
this
house
he
of
the
fruitful
chase
since
the
bold
hoghtons
from
this
hill
took
name
who
with
the
stiff
unbridled
saxons
came
and
so
have
flourish
in
this
fairer
clime
successively
from
that
to
this
our
time
still
offering
up
to
our
immortal
powers
sweet
incense
wine
and
odoriferous
flowers
while
sacred
vesta
in
her
virgin
tire
with
vows
and
wishes
tends
the
hallow
fire
now
seeing
that
thy
majesty
is
thus
greater
than
household
deities

render
up
to
thy
more
powerful
guard
this
tower

knight

long
long
mayst
thou
live
to

both

and

angels
cry
amen
amen
james
who
had
demeaned
himself
critically
during
the
delivery
of
the
address
observed
at
its
close
to
sir
richard
hoghton
who
was
standing
immediately
behind
his
chair
we
can
not
say
meikle
for
the
rhymes
which
are
but
indifferently
strung
together
but
the
sentiments
are
leal
and
gude
and
that
is
a
we
care
for
on
this
the
second
tutelar
divinity
advanced
and
throwing
himself
into
an
attitude
as
if
bewildered
by
the
august
presence
in
which
he
stood
exclaimed
thou
greatest
of
mortals
and
then
stopped
as
if
utterly
confounded
the
king
looked
at
him
for
a
moment
and
then
roared
out
weel
gudeman
your
commencement
is
pertinent
and
true
enough
and
though
we
be
greatest
of
mortals
as
ye
style
us
dinna
fash
yoursel
about
our
grandeur
but
go
on
as
if
we
were
nae
better
nor
wiser
than
your
ain
simple
sel
but
instead
of
encouraging
the
dumbfounded
deity
this
speech
completely
upset
him
he
hastily
retreated
and
in
trying
to
screen
himself
behind
the
huntsman
fell
back
from
the
stage
and
his
hound
leapt
after
him
the
incident
whether
premeditated
or
not
amused
the
spectators
much
more
than
any
speech
he
could
have
delivered
and
the
king
joined
heartily
in
the
merriment
silence
being
again
restored
the
first
divinity
came
forward
once
more
and
spoke
thus
lord
thy
majesty
hath
stricken
dumb
his
weaker
if
to
himself
he
come
unto
thy
service
straight
he
will
commend
these
foresters
and
charge
them
to
attend
thy
pleasure
in
this
park
and
show
such
sport
to
the
chief
huntsman
and
thy
princely
court
as
the
small
circle
of
this
round
affords
and
be
more
ready
than
he
was
in
words
weel
spoken
and
to
the
purpose
gude
fallow
cried
james
and
we
take
this
opportunity
of
assuring
our
worthy
host
in
the
presence
of
his
other
guests
that
we
have
never
had
better
sport
in
park
or
forest
than
we
have
this
day
enjoyed
have
never
eaten
better
cheer
nor
quaffed
better
wine
than
at
his
board
and
altogether
have
never
been
more
hospitably
welcomed
sir
richard
was
overwhelmed
by
his
majesty
commendation
i
have
done
nothing
my
gracious
liege
he
said
to
merit
such
acknowledgment
on
your
part
and
the
delight
i
experience
is
only
tempered
by
my
utter
unworthiness
man
replied
james
jocularly
ye
merit
a
vast
deal
mair
than
we
hae
said
to
you
but
gude
folk
dinna
always
get
their
deserts
ye
ken
that
sir
richard
and
now
hae
ye
not
some
ither
drolleries
in
store
for
us
the
baronet
replied
in
the
affirmative
and
soon
afterwards
the
stage
was
occupied
by
a
new
class
of
performers
and
a
drollery
commenced
which
kept
the
audience
in
one
continual
roar
of
laughter
so
long
as
it
lasted
and
yet
none
of
the
parts
had
been
studied
the
actors
entirely
trusting
to
their
own
powers
of
comedy
to
carry
it
out
the
principal
character
was
the
cap
justice
enacted
by
sir
john
finett
who
took
occasion
in
the
course
of
the
performance
to
lampoon
and
satirise
most
of
the
eminent
legal
characters
of
the
day
mimicking
the
voices
and
manner
of
the
three
justices
crooke
hoghton
and
doddridge
so
admirably
that
his
hearers
were
wellnigh
convulsed
and
the
three
learned
gentlemen
who
sat
near
the
king
though
fully
conscious
of
the
ridicule
applied
to
them
were
obliged
to
laugh
with
the
rest
but
the
unsparing
satirist
was
not
content
with
this
but
went
on
with
most
of
the
other
attendants
upon
the
king
and
being
intimately
versed
in
court
scandal
he
directed
his
lash
with
telling
effect
as
a
contrast
to
the
malicious
pleasantry
of
the
cap
justice
were
the
gambols
and
jests
of
robin
goodfellow
a
merry
imp
who
if
he
led
people
into
mischief
was
always
ready
to
get
them
out
of
it
then
there
was
a
dance
by
bill
huckler
old
crambo
and
tom
o
bedlam
the
individual
already
mentioned
as
being
among
the
crowd
in
the
base
court
this
was
applauded
to
the
echo
and
consequently
repeated
but
the
most
diverting
scene
of
all
was
that
in
which
jem
tospot
and
the
three
doll
wangos
appeared
though
given
in
the
broadest
vernacular
of
the
county
and
scarcely
intelligible
to
the
whole
of
the
company
the
dialogue
of
this
part
of
the
piece
was
so
lifelike
and
natural
that
every
one
recognised
its
truth
while
the
situations
arranged
with
the
slightest
effort
and
on
the
spur
of
the
moment
were
extremely
ludicrous
the
scene
was
supposed
to
take
place
in
a
small
lancashire
alehouse
where
a
jovial
pedlar
was
carousing
and
where
being
visited
by
his
three
sweethearts
each
of
whom
he
privately
declared
to
be
the
favourite
he
had
to
reconcile
their
differences
and
keep
them
all
in
familiar
with
the
character
in
all
its
aspects
nicholas
played
it
to
the
life
and
to
do
them
justice
dames
baldwyn
tetlow
and
nance
redferne
were
but
little
if
at
all
inferior
to
him
there
was
a
reality
in
their
jealous
quarrelling
that
gave
infinite
zest
to
the
performance
saul
o
my
body
exclaimed
james
admiringly
those
are
three
braw
women
ane
of
them
maun
be
sax
feet
if
she

in
which
a
man
will
appear
in
a
dendrological
foliage
of
fronds
replied
the
baronet
james
laughed
at
the
description
and
soon
afterwards
a
party
of
mummers
male
and
female
clad
in
various
grotesque
garbs
appeared
on
the
stage
in
the
midst
of
them
was
the
dendrological
man
enclosed
in
a
framework
of
green
boughs
like
that
borne
by
a
modern
a
ring
was
formed
by
the
mummers
and
the
round
commenced
to
lively
music
while
the
mazy
measure
was
proceeding
nance
redferne
who
had
quitted
the
stage
with
nicholas
and
now
stood
close
to
him
among
the
spectators
said
in
a
low
tone
look
there
the
squire
glanced
in
the
direction
indicated
and
to
his
surprise
and
terror
distinguished
among
the
crowd
at
a
little
distance
the
figure
of
a
cistertian
monk
he
is
invisible
to
every
eye
except
our
own
whispered
nance
and
is
come
to
tell
me
it
is
time
time
for
what
demanded
nicholas
time
for
you
to
seize
those
two
accursed
devices
jem
and
his
mother
replied
nance
they
are
both
on
yon
boards
jem
is
the
man
in
the
tree
and
elizabeth

in
the
red
kirtle
and

when
yo
pluck
off
her
mask
the
monk
is
gone
cried
nicholas
i
have
kept
my
eyes
steadily
fixed
on
him
and
he
has
melted
into
air
what
has
he
to
do
with
the
devices
he
is
their
fate
returned
nance
an
ey
ha
acted
under
his
orders
boh

an

them
ey
win
ge
wi
ye
forcing
his
way
through
the
crowd
nicholas
ran
up
the
steps
and
followed
by
nance
sprang
upon
the
stage
his
appearance
occasioned
considerable
surprise
but
as
he
was
recognised
by
the
spectators
as
the
jolly
jem
tospot
who
had
so
recently
diverted
them
and
his
companion
as
one
of
the
three
doll
wangos
in
anticipation
of
some
more
fun
they
received
him
with
a
round
of
applause
but
without
stopping
to
acknowledge
it
or
being
for
a
moment
diverted
from
his
purpose
nicholas
seized
the
old
crone
and
consigning
her
to
nance
caught
hold
of
the
leafy
frame
in
which
the
man
was
encased
and
pulled
him
from
under
it
but
he
began
to
think
he
had
unkennelled
the
wrong
fox
for
the
man
though
a
tall
fellow
bore
no
resemblance
to
jem
device
while
when
the
crone
mask
was
plucked
off
she
was
found
to
be
a
comely
young
woman
meanwhile
all
around
was
in
an
uproar
and
amidst
a
hurricane
of
hisses
yells
and
other
indications
of
displeasure
from
the
spectators
several
of
the
mummers
demanded
the
meaning
of
such
a
strange
and
unwarrantable
proceeding
they
are
a
couple
of
witches
cried
nicholas
this
is
jem
device
and
his
mother
elizabeth
my
name
is
nother
jem
nor
device
cried
the
man
nor
mine
elizabeth
screamed
the
woman
we
know
the
devices
cried
two
or
three
voices
and
these
are
none
of
nicholas
was
perplexed
the
storm
increased
threats
accompanied
the
hisses
when
luckily
he
espied
a
ring
on
the
man
finger
he
instantly
seized
his
hand
and
held
it
up
to
the
general
gaze
a
proof
a
proof
he
cried
this
sapphire
ring
was
given
by
the
king
to
my
cousin
richard

morning
and

now
the
woman

instantly
altered
many
years
being
added
to
it
in
a
breath
the
man
changed
equally
the
utmost
astonishment
was
evinced
by
all
at
the
transformation
and
the
bystanders
who
had
spoken
before
now
cried
out
loudly
we
know
them
perfectly
now
they
are
the
two
devices
by
this
time
an
officer
attended
by
a
party
of
halberdiers
had
mounted
the
boards
and
the
two
prisoners
were
delivered
to
their
custody
by

nance
ey

on

both
while
this
impromptu
performance
took
place
as
much
to
the
surprise
of
james
as
of
any
one
else
and
while
he
was
desiring
sir
richard
hoghton
to
ascertain
what
it
all
meant
at
the
very
moment
that
the
two
devices
and
nance
removed
from
the
stage
an
usher
approached
the
monarch
and
said
that
master
potts
entreated
a
moment
audience
of
his
majesty
potts
exclaimed
james
somewhat
confused
wha
is
he
ah
yes
i
recollect
a
weel
let
him
approach
accordingly
the
next
moment
the
little
attorney
whose
face
was
evidently
charged
with
some
tremendous
intelligence
was
ushered
into
the
king
presence
after
a
profound
reverence
he
said
may
it
please
your
majesty
i
have
something
for
your
private
ear
aweel
then
replied
james
approach
us
mair
closely
what
hae
ye
got
to
say
sir
aught
mair
anent
these
witches
a
great
deal
sire
said
potts
in
an
impressive
tone
something
dreadful
has
happened
something
terrible
eh
what
exclaimed
james
looking
alarmed
what
is
it
man
speak
murder
sire
murder
has
been
done
said
potts
in
low
thrilling
accents
murder
exclaimed
james
tell
us
a
about
it
and
without
more
ado
but
potts
was
still
circumspect
with
an
air
of
deepest
mystery
he
approached
his
head
as
near
as
he
dared
to
that
of
the
monarch
and
whispered
in
his
ear
can
this
be
true
cried
james
if
sae
it
very
shocking
very
sad
it
is
too
true
as
your
majesty
will
find
on
investigation
replied
potts
the
little
girl
i
told
you
of
jennet
device
saw
it
done
weel
weel
there
is
nae
accounting
for
human
frailty
and
wickedness
said
james
let
a
necessary
steps
be
taken
at
once
we
will
consider
what
to
do
but
d
hear
sir
dinna
let
the
bairn
jennet
go
haud
her
fast
d
mind
that
now
go
and
cause
the
guilty
party
to
be
put
under
arrest
and
on
receiving
this
command
master
potts
departed
scarcely
was
he
gone
than
nicholas
assheton
came
up
to
the
railing
of
the
platform
and
imploring
his
majesty
forgiveness
for
the
disturbance
he
had
occasioned
explained
that
it
had
been
owing
to
the
seizure
of
the
two
devices
who
for
some
wicked
but
unexplained
purpose
had
contrived
to
introduce
themselves
under
various
disguises
into
the
tower
ye
did
right
to
arrest
the
miscreants
sir
said
james
but
hae
ye
heard
what
has
happened
no
my
liege
replied
nicholas
alarmed
by
the
king
manner
what
is
it
come
nearer
and
ye
shall
learn
replied
james
for
we
wadna
hae
it
bruited
abroad
though
if
true
as
we
canna
doubt
it
will
be
known
soon
enough
and
as
the
squire
bent
forward
he
imparted
some
intelligence
to
him
which
instantly
changed
the
expression
of
the
latter
to
one
of
mingled
horror
and
rage
it
is
false
sire
he
cried
i
will
answer
for
her
innocence
with
my
life
she
could
not
do
it
your
majesty
patience
is
abused
it
is
jennet
who
has
done
it
not
she
but
i
will
unravel
the
terrible
mystery
you
have
the
other
two
wretches
prisoners
and
can
enforce
the
truth
from
them
we
will
essay
to
do
so
replied
james
but
we
have
also
another
prisoner
christopher
demdike
said
nicholas
ay
christopher
demdike
rejoined
james
but
another
besides
him
mistress

we

unmindful
of
it
even
though
he
can
not
send
us
the
ring
we
gave
him

replied
nicholas
it
was
stolen
from

by
the
villain

device
the
poor
youth
meant
to
use
it
for
alizon
i
now
deliver
it
to
your
majesty
as
coming
from
him
in
her
behalf
and
we
sae
receive
it
replied
the
monarch
brushing
away
the
moisture
that
gathered
thickly
in
his
eyes
at
this
moment
a
tall
personage
wrapped
in
a
cloak
who
appeared
to
be
an
officer
of
the
guard
approached
the
railing
i
am
come
to
inform
your
majesty
that
christopher
demdike
has
just
died
of
his
wounds
said
this
personage
and
sae
he
has
had
a
strae
death
after
a
rejoined
james
weel
we
are
sorry
for
it
his
portion
will
be
eternal
bale
observed
the
officer
how
know
you
that
sir
demanded
the
king
sharply
you
are
not
his
judge
i
witnessed
his
end
sire
replied
the
officer
and
no
man
who
died
as
he
died
can
be
saved
the
fiend
was
beside
him
at
the
save
us
exclaimed
james
ye
dinna
say
so
god
santie
man
but
this
is
grewsome
and
gars
the
flesh
creep
on
one
banes
let
his
foul
carcase
be
taen
awa
and
hangit
on
a
gibbet
on
the
hill
where
malkin
tower
aince
stood
as
a
warning
to
a
sic
heinous
offenders
as
the
king
ceased
speaking
master
potts
appeared
out
of
breath
and
greatly
excited
she
has
escaped
sire
he
cried
wha
jennet
exclaimed
james
if
sae
we
will
tang
you
in
her
stead
no
sire
alizon
replied
potts
i
can
nowhere
find
her
nor
and
he
hesitated
weel
weel
it
is
nae
great
matter
replied
james
as
if
relieved
and
with
a
glance
of
satisfaction
at
nicholas
i
know
where
alizon
is
sire
said
the
officer
indeed
exclaimed
james
this
fellow
is
strangely
officious
he
muttered
to
himself
and
where
may
she
be
sir
he
added
aloud
i
will
produce
her
within
a
quarter
of
an
hour
in
yonder
pavilion
replied
the
officer
and
all
that
master
potts
has
been
unable
to
find
your
majesty
may
trust
him
observed
nicholas
who
had
attentively
regarded
the
officer
depend
upon
it
he
will
make
good
his
words
you
think
so
cried
the
king
then
we
will
put
him
to
the
test
you
will
engage
to
confront
alizon
with
her
mother
he
added
to
the
officer
i
will
sire
replied
the
other
but
i
shall
require
the
assistance
of
a
dozen
men
tak
twenty
if
you
will
replied
the
king
i
am
impatient
to
see
what
you
can
do
in
a
quarter
of
a
minute
all
shall
be
ready
within
the
pavilion
sire
replied
the
officer
you
have
seen
one
masque
but
you
shall
now
behold
a
different
one
the
masque
of
death
and
he
disappeared
nicholas
felt
sure
he
would
accomplish
his
task
for
he
had
recognised
in
him
the
cistertian
monk
where
is
sir
richard
assheton
of
middleton
inquired
the
king
he
left
the
tower
with
his
daughter
dorothy
immediately
after
the
banquet
replied
nicholas
i
am
glad
of
it
right
glad
replied
the
monarch
the
terrible
intelligence
can
be
the
better
broken
to
them
if
it
had
come
upon
them
suddenly
it
might
have
been
fatal
especially
to
the
puir
lassie
let
sir
ralph
assheton
of
whalley
come
to
me
and
master
roger
nowell
of
read
your
majesty
shall
be
obeyed
replied
sir
richard
hoghton
the
king
then
gave
some
instructions
respecting
the
prisoners
and
bade
master
potts
have
jennet
in
readiness
and
now
to
see
what
terrible
thing
had
happened
chapter
fatality
along
the
eastern
terrace
a
youth
and
maiden
were
pacing
slowly
they
had
stolen
forth
unperceived
from
the
revel
and
passing
through
a
door
standing
invitingly
open
had
entered
the
garden
though
overjoyed
in
each
other
presence
the
solemn
beauty
of
the
night
so
powerful
in
its
contrast
to
the
riotous
scene
they
had
just
quitted
profoundly
impressed
them
above
were
the
deep
serene
heavens
lighted
up
by
the
starry
host
and
their
radiant
queen
below
the
immemorial
woods
steeped
in
silvery
mists
arising
from
the
stream
flowing
past
them
all
nature
was
hushed
in
holy
rest
in
opposition
to
the
flood
of
soft
light
emanating
from
the
lovely
planet
overhead
and
which
turned
all
it
fell
on
whether
tree
or
tower
or
stream
to
beauty
was
the
artificial
glare
caused
by
the
torches
near
the
pavilion
while
the
discordant
sounds
occasioned
by
the
minstrels
tuning
their
instruments
disturbed
the
repose
as
they
went
on
however
these
sounds
were
lost
in
the
distance
and
the
glare
of
the
torches
was
excluded
by
intervening
trees
then
the
moon
looked
down
lovingly
upon
them
and
the
only
music
that
reached
their
ears
arose
from
the
nightingales
after
a
pause
they
walked
on
again
gazing
at
each
other
at
the
glorious
heavens
and
drinking
in
the
thrilling
melody
of
the
songsters
of
the
grove
at
the
angle
of
the
terrace
was
a
small
arbour
placed
in
the
midst
of
a
bosquet
and
they
sat
down
within
it
then
and
not
till
then
did
their
thoughts
find
vent
in
words
forgetting
the
sorrows
they
had
endured
and
the
perils
by
which
they
were
environed
they
found
in
their
deep
mutual
love
a
shield
against
the
sharpest
arrows
of
fate
in
low
gentle
accents
they
breathed
their
passion
solemnly
plighting
their
faith
before
heaven
poor
souls
they
were
happy
then
intensely
happy
alas
that
their
happiness
should
be
so
short
for
those
few
moments
of
bliss
stolen
from
a
waste
of
tears
were
all
that
were
allowed
them
inexorable
fate
still
dogged
their
footsteps
amidst
the
bosquet
stood
a
listener
to
their
converse
a
little
girl
with
high
shoulders
and
sharp
features
on
which
diabolical
malice
was
stamped
two
yellow
eyes
glistened
through
the
leaves
beside
her
marking
the
presence
of
a
cat
as
the
lovers
breathed
their
vows
and
indulged
in
hopes
never
to
be
realised
the
wicked
child
grinned
clenched
her
hands
and
grudging
them
their
happiness
seemed
inclined
to
interrupt
it
some
stronger
motive
however
kept
her
quiet
what
are
the
pair
talking
of
now
she
hears
her
own
name
mentioned
by
the
maiden
who
speaks
of
her
with
pity
almost
with
affection
pardons
her
for
the
mischief
she
has
done
her
and
hopes
heaven
will
pardon
her
likewise
but
she
knows
not
the
full
extent
of
the
girl
malignity
or
even
her
gentle
heart
must
have
been
roused
to
resentment
the
little
girl
however
feels
no
compunction
infernal
malice
has
taken
possession
of
her
heart
and
crushed
every
kindly
feeling
within
it
she
hates
all
those
that
compassionate
her
and
returns
evil
for
good
what
are
the
lovers
talking
of
now
of
their
first
meeting
at
whalley
abbey
when
one
was
may
queen
and
by
her
beauty
and
simplicity
won
the
other
heart
losing
her
own
at
the
same
time
a
bright
unclouded
career
seemed
to
lie
before
them
then
wofully
had
it
darkened
since
alas
alas
the
little
girl
smiles
she
hopes
they
will
go
on
she
likes
to
hear
them
talk
thus
past
happiness
is
ever
remembered
with
a
pang
by
the
wretched
and
they
happy
then
go
on
go
on
but
they
are
silent
for
awhile
for
they
wish
to
dwell
on
that
hopeful
that
blissful
season
and
a
nightingale
alighting
on
a
bough
above
them
pours
forth
its
sweet
plaint
as
if
in
response
to
their
tender
emotions
they
praise
the
bird
song
and
it
suddenly
ceases
for
the
little
girl
full
of
malevolence
stretches
forth
her
hand
and
it
drops
to
the
ground
as
if
stricken
by
a
dart
is
thy
heart
broken
poor
bird
exclaimed
the
young
man
taking
up
the
hapless
songster
yet
warm
and
palpitating
to
die
in
the
midst
of
thy
song
is
hard
very
hard
replied
the
maiden
tearfully
its
fate
seems
a
type
of
our
own
the
little
girl
laughed
but
in
a
low
tone
and
to
herself
the
pair
then
grew
sad
this
slight
incident
had
touched
them
deeply
and
their
conversation
took
a
melancholy
turn
they
spoke
of
the
blights
that
had
nipped
their
love
in
the
bud
of
the
canker
that
had
eaten
into
its
heart
of
the
destiny
that
so
relentlessly
pursued
them
threatening
to
separate
them
for
ever
the
little
girl
laughed
merrily
then
they
spoke
of
the
grave
and
of
hope
beyond
the
grave
and
they
spoke
cheerfully
the
little
girl
could
laugh
no
longer
for
with
her
all
beyond
the
grave
was
despair
after
that
they
spoke
of
the
terrible
power
that
satan
had
lately
obtained
in
that
unhappy
district
of
the
arts
he
had
employed
and
of
the
votaries
he
had
won
both
prayed
fervently
that
his
snares
might
be
circumvented
and
his
rule
destroyed
during
this
part
of
the
discourse
the
cat
swelled
to
the
size
of
a
tiger
and
his
eyes
glowed
like
fiery
coals
he
made
a
motion
as
if
he
would
spring
forward
but
the
voice
of
prayer
arrested
him
and
he
shrank
back
to
his
former
size
poor
jennet
is
ensnared
by
the
fiend
murmured
the
maiden
and
will
perish
eternally
would
i
could
save
her
it
can
not
be
replied
the
young
man
she
is
beyond
redemption
the
little
girl
gnashed
her
teeth
with
rage
but
my
mother
i
do
not
now
despair
of
her
said
alizon
she
has
broken
the
bondage
by
which
she
was
enchained
and
if
she
resists
temptation
to
the
last
i
am
assured
will
be
saved
heaven
aid
her
exclaimed
richard
scarcely
were
the
words
uttered
than
the
cat
disappeared
why
tib
where
are
yo
tib
ey
want
yo
cried
the
little
girl
in
a
low
tone
but
the
familiar
did
not
respond
to
the
call
where
con
he
ha
gone
cried
jennet
tib
tib
still
the
cat
came
not
then
ey
mun
do
the
wark
without
him
pursued
the
little
girl
an
ey
win
no
longer
delay
it
and
with
this
she
crept
stealthily
round
the
arbour
and
approaching
the
side
where
richard
sat
watched
an
opportunity
of
touching
him
unperceived
as
her
finger
came
in
contact
with
his
frame
a
pang
like
death
shot
through
his
heart
and
he
fell
upon
alizon
shoulder
are
you
ill
she
exclaimed
gazing
at
his
pallid
features
rendered
ghastly
white
by
the
moonlight
richard
could
make
no
reply
and
alizon
becoming
dreadfully
alarmed
was
about
to
fly
for
assistance
but
the
young
man
by
a
great
effort
detained
her
ey
mun
now
run
an
tell
mester
potts
so
that
hoo
may
be
found
wi
him
muttered
jennet
creeping
away
just
then
richard
recovered
his
speech
but
his
words
were
faintly
uttered
and
with
difficulty
alizon
he
said
i
will
not
attempt
to
disguise
my
condition
from
you
i
am
dying
and
my
death
will
be
attributed
to
you
for
persons
have
persuaded
the
king
that
you
have
bewitched
me
and
he
will
believe
the
charge
now
oh
if
you
would
ease
the
pangs
of
death
for
me
if
you
would
console
my
latest
moments
leave
me
and
quit
this
place
before
it
be
too
late
oh
richard
she
cried
distractedly
you
ask
more
than
i
can
perform
if
you
are
indeed
in
such
imminent
danger
i
will
stay
with
you
will
die
with
you
no
live
for
me
live
save
yourself
alizon
implored
the
young
man
your
danger
is
greater
than
mine
a
dreadful
death
awaits
you
at
the
stake
oh
mercy
mercy
heaven
spare
her
in
pity
spare
her
have
we
not
suffered
enough
i
can
no
more
farewell
for
ever
alizon
one
kiss
the
last
and
as
their
lips
met
his
strength
utterly
forsook
him
and
he
fell
backwards
one
grave
he
murmured
one
grave
alizon
and
so
without
a
groan
he
expired
alizon
neither
screamed
nor
swooned
but
remained
in
a
state
of
stupefaction
gazing
at
the
body
as
the
moon
fell
upon
the
placid
features
they
looked
as
if
locked
in
slumber
there
he
lay
the
young
the
brave
the
beautiful
the
loving
the
beloved
fate
had
triumphed
death
had
done
his
work
but
he
had
only
performed
half
his
task
one
grave
one
grave
it
was
his
last
wish
it
shall
be
so
she
cried
in
frenzied
tones
i
shall
thus
escape
my
enemies
and
avoid
the
horrible
and
shameful
death
to
which
they
would
doom
me
and
she
snatched
the
dagger
from
the
youth
side
now
fate
i
defy
thee
she
cried
with
a
fearful
laugh
one
last
look
at
that
calm
beautiful
face
one
kiss
of
the
cold
lips
which
can
no
more
return
the
endearment
and
the
dagger
is
pointed
at
her
breast
but
she
is
withheld
by
an
arm
of
iron
and
the
weapon
falls
from
her
grasp
she
looks
up
a
tall
figure
clothed
in
the
mouldering
habiliments
of
a
cistertian
monk
stands
beside
her
she
knows
the
vestments
at
once
for
she
has
seen
them
before
hanging
up
in
the
closet
adjoining
her
mother
chamber
at
whalley
abbey
and
the
features
of
the
ghostly
monk
seem
familiar
to
her
raise
not
thy
hand
against
thyself
said
the
phantom
in
a
tone
of
awful
reproof
it
is
the
fiend
prompts
thee
to
do
it
he
would
take
advantage
of
thy
misery
to
destroy
thee
i
took
thee
for
the
fiend
replied
alizon
gazing
at
him
with
wonder
rather
than
with
terror
who
art
thou
the
enemy
of
thy
enemies
and
therefore
thy
friend
replied
the
monk
i
would
have
saved
thy
lover
if
i
could
but
his
destiny
was
not
to
be
averted
but
rest
content
i
will
avenge
him
i
do
not
want
vengeance
i
want
to
be
with
him
she
replied
frantically
embracing
the
body
thou
wilt
soon
be
with
him
said
the
phantom
in
tones
of
deep
significance
arise
and
come
with
me
thy
mother
needs
thy
assistance
my
mother
exclaimed
alizon
clearing
the
blinding
tresses
from
her
brow
where
is
she
follow
me
and
i
will
bring
thee
to
her
said
the
monk
and
leave
him
i
can
not
cried
alizon
gazing
wildly
at
the
body
you
must
a
soul
is
at
stake
and
will
perish
if
you
come
not
said
the
monk
he
is
at
rest
and
you
will
speedily
rejoin
him
with
that
assurance
i
will
go
replied
alizon
with
a
last
look
at
the
object
of
her
love
one
grave
lay
us
in
one
grave
it
shall
be
done
according
to
your
wish
said
the
monk
and
he
glided
on
with
noiseless
footsteps
alizon
followed
him
along
the
terrace
presently
they
came
to
a
dark
walk
leading
to
a
labyrinth
and
tracking
it
swiftly
as
well
as
the
overarched
and
intricate
path
to
which
it
conducted
they
entered
a
grotto
whence
a
flight
of
steps
descended
to
a
subterranean
passage
hewn
out
of
the
rock
along
this
passage
which
was
of
some
extent
the
monk
proceeded
and
alizon
followed
him
at
last
they
came
to
another
flight
of
steps
and
here
the
monk
stopped
we
are
now
beneath
the
pavilion
where
you
will
find
your
mother
he
said
mount
the
way
is
clear
before
you
i
have
other
work
to
do
alizon
obeyed
and
as
she
advanced
was
surprised
to
find
the
monk
gone
he
had
neither
passed
her
nor
ascended
the
steps
and
must
therefore
have
sunk
into
the
earth
chapter
the
last
hour
within
the
pavilion
sat
alice
nutter
she
was
clad
in
deep
mourning
but
her
dress
seemed
disordered
as
if
by
hasty
travel
her
looks
were
full
of
anguish
and
terror
her
blanched
tresses
once
so
dark
and
beautiful
hung
dishevelled
over
her
shoulders
and
her
thin
hands
were
clasped
in
supplication
her
cheeks
were
ashy
pale
but
on
her
brow
was
a
bright
red
mark
as
if
traced
by
a
finger
dipped
in
blood
a
lamp
was
burning
on
the
table
beside
her
near
it
was
a
skull
and
near
this
emblem
of
mortality
an
hourglass
running
fast
the
windows
and
doors
of
the
building
were
closed
and
it
would
seem
the
unhappy
lady
was
a
prisoner
she
had
been
brought
there
secretly
that
night
with
what
intent
she
knew
not
but
she
felt
sure
it
was
with
no
friendly
design
towards
herself
early
in
the
day
three
horsemen
had
arrived
at
her
retreat
in
pendle
forest
and
without
making
any
charge
against
her
or
explaining
whither
they
meant
to
take
her
or
indeed
answering
any
inquiry
had
brought
her
off
with
them
and
proceeding
across
the
country
had
arrived
at
a
forester
hut
on
the
outskirts
of
hoghton
park
here
they
tarried
till
evening
placing
her
in
a
room
by
herself
and
keeping
strict
watch
over
her
and
when
the
shadows
of
night
fell
they
conveyed
her
through
the
woods
and
by
a
private
entrance
to
the
gardens
of
the
tower
and
with
equal
secresy
to
the
pavilion
where
setting
a
lamp
before
her
they
left
her
to
her
meditations
all
refused
to
answer
her
inquiries
but
one
of
them
with
a
sinister
smile
placed
the
hourglass
and
skull
beside
her
left
alone
the
wretched
lady
vainly
sought
some
solution
of
the
enigma
why
she
had
been
brought
thither
she
could
not
solve
it
but
she
determined
if
her
capture
had
been
made
by
any
lawful
authorities
to
confess
her
guilt
and
submit
to
condign
punishment
though
the
windows
and
doors
were
closed
as
before
mentioned
sounds
from
without
reached
her
and
she
heard
confused
and
tumultuous
noises
as
if
from
a
large
assemblage
for
what
purpose
were
they
met
could
it
be
for
her
execution
no
there
were
strains
of
music
and
bursts
of
laughter
and
yet
she
had
heard
that
the
burning
of
a
witch
was
a
spectacle
in
which
the
populace
delighted
that
they
looked
upon
it
as
a
show
like
any
other
and
why
should
they
not
laugh
and
have
music
at
it
but
could
she
be
executed
without
trial
without
judgment
she
knew
not
all
she
knew
was
she
was
guilty
and
deserved
to
die
but
when
this
idea
took
possession
of
her
the
laughter
sounded
in
her
ears
like
the
yells
of
demons
and
the
strains
like
the
fearful
harmonies
she
had
heard
at
weird
sabbaths
all
at
once
she
recollected
with
indescribable
terror
that
on
this
very
night
the
compact
she
had
entered
into
with
the
fiend
expired
that
at
midnight
unless
by
her
penitence
and
prayers
she
had
worked
out
her
salvation
he
could
claim
her
she
recollected
also
and
with
increased
uneasiness
that
the
man
who
had
set
the
hourglass
on
the
table
and
who
had
regarded
her
with
a
sinister
smile
as
he
did
so
had
said
it
was
eleven
her
last
hour
then
had
arrived
nay
was
partly
spent
and
the
moments
were
passing
swiftly
by
the
agony
she
endured
at
this
thought
was
intense
she
felt
as
if
reason
were
forsaking
her
and
but
for
her
determined
efforts
to
resist
it
such
a
crisis
might
have
occurred
but
she
knew
that
her
eternal
welfare
depended
upon
the
preservation
of
her
mental
balance
and
she
strove
to
maintain
it
and
in
the
end
succeeded
her
gaze
was
fixed
intently
on
the
hourglass
she
saw
the
sand
trickling
silently
but
swiftly
down
like
a
current
of
which
when
it
ceased
life
would
cease
with
it
she
saw
the
shining
grains
above
insensibly
diminishing
in
quantity
and
as
if
she
could
arrest
her
destiny
by
the
act
she
seized
the
glass
and
would
have
turned
it
but
the
folly
of
the
proceeding
arrested
her
and
she
set
it
down
again
then
horrible
thoughts
came
upon
her
crushing
her
and
overwhelming
her
and
she
felt
by
anticipation
all
the
torments
she
would
speedily
have
to
endure
oceans
of
fire
in
which
miserable
souls
were
for
ever
tossing
rolled
before
her
yells
such
as
no
human
anguish
can
produce
smote
her
ears
monsters
of
frightful
form
yawned
to
devour
her
fiends
armed
with
terrible
implements
of
torture
such
as
the
wildest
imagination
can
not
paint
menaced
her
all
hell
and
its
horrors
was
there
its
dreadful
gulf
its
roaring
furnaces
its
rivers
of
molten
metal
ever
burning
yet
never
consuming
its
victims
a
hot
sulphureous
atmosphere
oppressed
her
and
a
film
of
blood
dimmed
her
sight
she
endeavoured
to
pray
but
her
tongue
clove
to
the
roof
of
her
mouth
she
looked
about
for
her
bible
but
it
had
been
left
behind
when
she
was
taken
from
her
retreat
she
had
no
safeguard
none
still
the
sand
ran
on
new
agonies
assailed
her
hell
was
before
her
again
but
in
a
new
form
and
with
new
torments
she
closed
her
eyes
she
shut
her
ears
but
she
saw
it
still
and
heard
its
terrific
yells
again
she
consults
the
hourglass
the
sand
is
running
on
ever
diminishing
new
torments
assail
her
she
thinks
of
all
she
loves
most
on
earth
of
her
daughter
oh
if
alizon
were
near
her
she
might
pray
for
her
might
scare
away
these
frightful
visions
might
save
her
she
calls
to
her
but
she
answers
not
no
she
is
utterly
abandoned
of
god
and
man
and
must
perish
eternally
again
she
consults
the
hourglass
one
quarter
of
an
hour
is
all
that
remains
to
her
oh
that
she
could
employ
it
in
prayer
oh
that
she
could
kneel
or
even
weep
a
large
mirror
hangs
against
the
wall
and
she
is
drawn
towards
it
by
an
irresistible
impulse
she
sees
a
figure
within
it
but
she
does
not
know
herself
can
that
cadaverous
object
with
the
white
hair
that
seems
from
the
grave
be
she
it
must
be
a
phantom
no
she
touches
her
cheek
and
finds
it
is
real
but
ah
what
is
this
red
brand
upon
her
brow
it
must
be
the
seal
of
the
demon
she
tries
to
efface
it
but
it
will
not
come
out
on
the
contrary
it
becomes
redder
and
deeper
again
she
consults
the
glass
the
sand
is
still
running
on
how
many
minutes
remain
to
her
ten
cried
a
voice
replying
to
her
mental
ten
and
turning
she
perceived
her
familiar
standing
beside
her
thy
time
is
wellnigh
out
alice
nutter
he
said
in
ten
minutes
my
lord
will
claim
thee
my
compact
with
thy
master
is
broken
she
replied
summoning
up
all
her
resolution
i
have
long
ceased
to
use
the
power
bestowed
upon
me
but
even
if
i
had
wished
it
thou
hast
refused
to
serve
me
i
have
refused
to
serve
you
madam
because
you
have
disobeyed
the
express
injunctions
of
my
master
replied
the
familiar
but
your
apostasy
does
not
free
you
from
bondage
you
have
merely
lost
advantages
which
you
might
have
enjoyed
if
you
chose
to
dismiss
me
i
could
not
help
it
neither
i
nor
my
lord
have
been
to
blame
we
have
performed
our
part
of
the
contract
why
am
i
brought
hither
demanded
mistress
nutter
i
will
tell
you
replied
the
familiar
you
were
brought
here
by
order
of
the
king
your
retreat
was
revealed
to
him
by
master
potts
who
learnt
it
from
jennet
device
the
sapient
sovereign
intended
to
confront
you
with
your
daughter
alizon
who
like
yourself
is
accused
of
witchcraft
but
he
will
be
disappointed
for
when
he
comes
for
you
you
will
be
out
of
his
reach
ha
ha
and
he
rubbed
his
hands
at
the
jest
alizon
accused
of
witchcraft
thou
cried
mistress
nutter
ay
replied
the
familiar
she
is
suspected
of
bewitching
richard
assheton
who
has
been
done
to
death
by
jennet
device
for
one
so
young
the
little
girl
has
certainly
a
rare
turn
for
mischief
but
no
one
will
know
the
real
author
of
the
crime
and
alizon
will
suffer
for
it
heaven
will
not
suffer
such
iniquity
said
the
lady
as
you
have
nothing
to
do
with
heaven
madam
it
is
needless
to
refer
to
it
said
the
familiar
but
it
certainly
is
rather
hard
that
one
so
young
as
alizon
should
perish
can
you
save
her
asked
mistress
nutter
oh
yes
i
save
her
but
she
will
not
let
me
replied
the
familiar
with
a
grin
no
no
it
is
impossible
cried
the
wretched
woman
and
i
can
not
help
her
perhaps
you
might
observed
the
tempter
my
master
whom
you
accuse
of
harshness
is
ever
willing
to
oblige
you
you
have
a
few
minutes
left
do
you
wish
him
to
aid
her
command
me
and
i
will
obey
you
this
is
some
snare
thought
mistress
nutter
i
will
resist
it
you
can
not
be
worse
off
than
you
are
remarked
the
familiar
i
know
not
that
replied
the
lady
what
thou
do
whatever
you
command
me
madam
i
can
do
nothing
of
my
own
accord
shall
i
bring
your
daughter
here
say
so
and
it
shall
be
done
no
thou
ensnare
me
she
replied
i
well
know
thou
hast
no
power
over
her
thou
place
some
phantasm
before
me
i
would
see
her
but
not
through
thy
agency
she
is
here
cried
alizon
opening
the
door
of
a
closet
and
rushing
towards
her
mother
who
instantly
locked
her
in
her
arms
pray
for
me
my
child
cried
mistress
nutter
mastering
her
emotion
or
i
shall
be
snatched
from
you
for
ever
my
moments
are
numbered
pray
pray
alizon
fell
on
her
knees
and
prayed
fervently
you
waste
your
breath
cried
the
familiar
in
a
mocking
tone
never
till
the
brand
shall
disappear
from
her
brow
and
the
writing
traced
in
her
blood
shall
vanish
from
this
parchment
can
she
be
saved
she
is
mine
pray
alizon
pray
shrieked
mistress
nutter
i
will
tear
her
in
pieces
if
she
does
not
cease
cried
the
familiar
assuming
a
terrible
shape
and
menacing
her
with
claws
like
those
of
a
wild
beast
pray
thou
mother
cried
alizon
i
can
not
replied
the
lady
i
will
kill
her
if
she
but
makes
the
attempt
howled
the
demon
but
try
mother
try
cried
alizon
the
poor
lady
dropped
on
her
knees
and
raised
her
hands
in
humble
supplication
heaven
forgive
me
she
exclaimed
the
demon
seized
the
hourglass
the
sand
is
out
her
term
has
expired
she
is
mine
he
cried
clasp
thy
arms
tightly
round
me
my
child
he
can
not
take
me
from
thee
shrieked
the
agonised
woman
release
her
alizon
or
i
will
slay
thee
likewise
roared
the
demon
never
she
replied
thou
canst
not
overcome
me
ha
she
added
joyfully
the
brand
has
disappeared
from
her
brow
and
the
writing
from
the
parchment
howled
the
demon
but
i
will
have
her
notwithstanding
and
he
plunged
his
claws
into
alice
nutter
flesh
but
her
daughter
held
her
fast
oh
hold
me
my
child
hold
me
or
i
am
lost
shrieked
the
lady
be
warned
and
let
her
go
or
thy
life
shall
pay
for
her
cried
the
demon
my
life
for
her
willingly
replied
alizon
then
take
thy
fate
rejoined
the
evil
spirit
and
placing
his
hand
upon
her
heart
it
instantly
ceased
to
beat
mother
thou
art
saved
saved
exclaimed
alizon
throwing
out
her
arms
and
gazing
at
her
for
an
instant
with
a
seraphic
look
she
fell
backwards
and
expired
thou
art
mine
roared
the
demon
seizing
mistress
nutter
by
the
hair
and
dragging
her
from
her
daughter
body
to
which
she
clung
desperately
help
help
she
cried
thou
mayst
call
but
thy
cries
will
be
unheeded
rejoined
the
familiar
with
mocking
laughter
thou
liest
false
fiend
said
mistress
nutter
heaven
will
help
me
now
and
as
she
spoke
the
cistertian
monk
stood
before
them
hence
he
cried
with
an
imperious
gesture
to
the
demon
she
is
no
longer
in
thy
power
hence
and
with
a
howl
of
rage
and
disappointment
the
familiar
vanished
alice
nutter
continued
the
monk
thy
safety
has
been
purchased
at
the
price
of
thy
daughter
life
but
it
is
of
little
moment
for
she
could
not
live
long
her
gentle
heart
was
broken
and
when
the
demon
stopped
it
for
ever
he
performed
unintentionally
a
merciful
act
she
must
rest
in
the
same
grave
with
him
she
loved
so
well
during
life
this
tell
to
those
who
will
come
to
thee
anon
thou
art
delivered
from
the
yoke
of
satan
full
expiation
has
been
made
but
earthly
justice
must
be
satisfied
thou
must
pay
the
penalty
for
crimes
committed
in
the
flesh
but
what
thou
sufferest
here
shall
avail
thee
hereafter
i
am
content
she
replied
pass
the
rest
of
thy
life
in
penitence
and
prayer
pursued
the
monk
and
let
nothing
divert
thee
from
it
for
though
free
now
thou
wilt
be
subject
to
evil
influence
and
temptations
to
the
last
remember
this
i
will
i
will
she
rejoined
and
now
he
said
kneel
beside
thy
daughter
body
and
pray
i
will
return
to
thee
ere
many
minutes
be
passed
one
task
more
and
then
my
mission
is
ended
chapter
the
masque
of
death
short
time
as
he
had
to
await
james
was
unable
to
control
his
impatience
at
last
he
arose
and
completely
sobered
by
the
recent
strange
events
descended
the
steps
of
the
platform
and
walked
on
without
assistance
let
the
yeomen
of
the
guard
keep
back
the
crowd
he
said
to
an
officer
and
let
none
follow
me
but
sir
ralph
assheton
master
nicholas
assheton
and
master
roger
nowell
when
i
call
let
the
prisoners
be
brought
forward
your
majesty
shall
be
obeyed
replied
the
baronet
giving
the
necessary
directions
james
then
moved
slowly
forward
in
the
direction
of
the
pavilion
and
as
he
went
called
nicholas
assheton
to
him
wha
was
that
officer
he
asked
your
pardon
my
liege
but
i
can
not
answer
the
question
replied
nicholas
and
why
not
sir
demanded
the
monarch
sharply
for
reasons
i
will
hereafter
render
to
your
majesty
and
which
i
am
persuaded
you
will
find
satisfactory
rejoined
the
squire
weel
weel
i
dare
say
you
are
right
said
the
king
but
do
you
think
he
will
keep
his
word
i
am
sure
of
it
returned
nicholas
the
time
is
come
then
exclaimed
james
impatiently
and
looking
up
at
the
pavilion
the
time
is
come
echoed
a
sepulchral
voice
did
you
speak
inquired
the
monarch
no
sire
replied
nicholas
but
some
one
seemed
to
give
you
intimation
that
all
is
ready
will
it
please
you
to
go
on
enter
cried
the
voice
wha
speaks
demanded
the
king
and
as
no
answer
was
returned
he
continued
i
will
not
set
foot
in
the
structure
it
may
be
a
snare
of
satan
at
this
moment
the
shutters
of
the
windows
flew
open
showing
that
the
pavilion
was
lighted
up
by
many
tapers
within
while
solemn
strains
of
music
issued
from
it
enter
repeated
the
voice
have
no
fear
sire
said
nicholas
that
canna
be
the
wark
o
the
deil
cried
james
he
does
not
delight
in
holy
hymns
and
sweet
music
that
is
a
solemn
dirge
for
the
dead
observed
nicholas
as
melodious
voices
mingled
with
the
music
weel
weel
i
will
go
on
at
a
hazards
said
james
the
doors
flew
open
as
the
king
and
his
attendants
approached
and
as
soon
as
they
had
passed
through
them
the
valves
swung
back
to
their
places
a
strange
sad
spectacle
met
their
gaze
in
the
midst
of
the
chamber
stood
a
bier
covered
with
a
velvet
pall
and
on
it
the
bodies
of
a
youth
and
maiden
were
deposited
pale
and
beautiful
were
they
as
sculptured
marble
and
a
smile
sat
upon
their
features
side
by
side
they
were
lying
with
their
arms
enfolded
as
if
they
had
died
in
each
other
embrace
a
wreath
of
yew
and
cypress
was
placed
above
their
heads
and
flowers
were
scattered
round
them
they
were
richard
and
alizon
it
was
a
deeply
touching
sight
and
for
some
time
none
spake
the
solemn
dirge
continued
interrupted
only
by
the
stifled
sobs
of
the
listeners
both
gone
exclaimed
nicholas
in
accents
broken
by
emotion
and
so
young
so
good
so
beautiful
alas
alas
she
could
not
have
bewitched
him
said
the
king
alizon
was
all
purity
and
goodness
cried
nicholas
and
is
now
numbered
with
the
angels
the
guilty
one
is
in
thy
hands
o
king
said
the
voice
it
is
for
thee
to
punish
and
i
will
not
hold
my
hand
said
james
the
devices
shall
assuredly
perish
when
i
go
from
this
chamber
i
will
have
them
conveyed
under
a
strong
escort
to
lancaster
castle
they
shall
die
by
the
hands
of
the
common
executioner
my
mission
then
is
complete
replied
the
voice
i
can
rest
in
who
art
thou
demanded
the
king
one
who
sinned
deeply
but
is
now
pardoned
replied
the
voice
the
king
was
for
a
moment
lost
in
reflection
and
then
turned
to
depart
at
this
moment
a
kneeling
figure
whom
no
one
had
hitherto
noticed
arose
from
behind
the
bier
it
was
a
lady
robed
in
mourning
so
ghastly
pale
were
her
features
and
so
her
attenuated
frame
that
james
thought
he
beheld
a
spectre
and
recoiled
in
terror
the
figure
advanced
slowly
towards
him
who
and
what
art
thou
in
heaven
name
he
exclaimed
i
am
alice
nutter
sire
replied
the
lady
prostrating
herself
before
him
alice
nutter
the
witch
cried
the
king
why
ay
i
recollect
thou
wert
here
i
sent
for
thee
but
recent
terrible
events
had
put
thee
clean
out
of
my
head
but
expect
no
grace
from
me
evil
woman
i
will
show
thee
none
i
ask
none
sire
replied
the
penitent
i
came
to
place
myself
in
your
hands
that
justice
may
be
done
upon
me
ah
exclaimed
james
dost
thou
indeed
repent
thee
of
thy
iniquities
dost
thou
abjure
the
devil
and
all
his
works
i
do
replied
the
lady
fervently
my
compact
with
the
evil
one
has
been
broken
by
the
prayers
of
my
devoted
daughter
who
sacrificed
herself
for
me
and
thereby
saved
my
soul
alive
but
human
justice
requires
an
expiation
and
i
am
anxious
to
make
it
arise
woman
said
the
king
much
moved
you
must
go
to
lancaster
but
in
consideration
of
your
penitence
no
indignity
shall
be
shown
you
you
must
be
strictly
guarded
but
you
shall
not
be
taken
with
the
other
prisoners
i
humbly
thank
your
majesty
replied
the
lady
may
i
take
a
last
farewell
of
my
child
do
so
replied
james
alice
nutter
then
approached
the
bier
and
after
gazing
for
a
moment
with
deepest
fondness
upon
the
features
of
her
daughter
imprinted
a
kiss
upon
her
marble
brow
in
doing
this
her
tears
fell
fast
you
can
weep
i
see
observed
the
king
you
are
a
witch
no
longer
ay
heaven
be
praised
i
can
weep
she
replied
and
so
ease
my
heart
oh
sire
none
but
those
who
have
experienced
it
can
tell
the
agony
of
being
denied
this
relief
of
nature
farewell
for
ever
my
blessed
child
she
exclaimed
kissing
her
brow
again
and
you
too
her
beloved
nicholas
assheton
it
was
her
wish
to
be
buried
in
the
same
grave
with
richard
you
will
see
it
done
nicholas
i
will
i
will
replied
the
squire
in
a
voice
of
deepest
emotion
and
i
likewise
promise
it
said
sir
ralph
assheton
they
shall
rest
together
in
whalley
churchyard
it
is
well
that
sir
richard
and
dorothy
are
gone
he
observed
to
nicholas
it
is
indeed
said
the
squire
or
we
should
have
had
another
funeral
to
perform
pray
heaven
it
be
not
so
now
have
you
any
other
request
to
prefer
demanded
the
king
none
whatever
sire
replied
the
lady
except
that
i
wish
to
make
full
restitution
of
all
the
land
i
have
robbed
him
of
to
master
roger
nowell
and
as
some
compensation
i
would
fain
add
certain
lands
adjoining
which
have
been
conveyed
over
to
sir
ralph
and
nicholas
assheton
only
annexing
the
condition
that
a
small
sum
annually
be
given
in
dole
to
the
poor
of
the
parish
that
i
may
be
remembered
in
their
prayers
we
will
see
it
done
said
sir
ralph
and
nicholas
and
i
will
see
my
part
fulfilled
said
nowell
for
any
wrong
you
have
done
me
i
now
freely
and
fully
forgive
you
and
may
heaven
in
its
infinite
mercy
forgive
you
likewise
amen
ejaculated
the
monarch
and
all
the
others
joined
in
the
ejaculation
the
king
then
moved
to
the
door
which
was
opened
for
him
by
the
two
asshetons
at
the
foot
of
the
steps
stood
master
potts
attended
by
an
officer
of
the
guard
and
a
party
of
halberdiers
in
the
midst
of
them
with
their
hands
tied
behind
their
backs
were
jem
device
his
mother
jennet
and
poor
nance
redferne
jem
looked
dogged
and
sullen
elizabeth
downcast
but
jennet
retained
her
accustomed
malignant
expression
poor
nance
was
the
only
one
who
excited
any
sympathy
jennet
malice
seemed
now
directed
against
master
potts
whom
she
charged
with

betrayed
and
deceived

he

sire
as
the
prisoners
were
removed
nance
redferne
looked
round
her
and
catching
the
eye
of
nicholas
made
a
slight
motion
with
her
head
as
if
bidding
him
farewell
the
squire
returned
the
mute
valediction
poor
nance
he
exclaimed
compassionately
i
sincerely
pity
her
would
there
was
any
means
of
saving
her
there

none
observed
sir
ralph
assheton
and
you
may
be
thankful
you
are
not
brought
in
as
her
accomplice
as
jennet
was
taken
away
she
continued
to
hurl
threats
and
imprecations
against
potts
another
officer
of
the
guard
was
then
summoned
and
when
he
came
james
said
one
other
prisoner
remains
within
the
pavilion
she
likewise
must
be
conveyed
to
lancaster
castle
but
in
a
litter
and
not
with
the
other
prisoners
attended
by
sir
richard
hoghton
the
monarch
then
proceeded
to
his
lodgings
in
the
tower
chapter
one
grave
notwithstanding
the
sad
occurrences
above
detailed
james
remained
for
two
more
days
the
guest
of
sir
richard
hoghton
enjoying
his
princely
hospitality
hunting
in
the
park
carousing
in
the
great
hall
and
witnessing
all
kinds
of
sports
nothing
indeed
was
left
to
remind
him
of
the
sad
events
that
had
occurred
the
prisoners
were
taken
that
night
to
lancaster
castle
and
master
potts
accompanied
the
escort
to
be
ready
for
the
assizes
the
three
judges
proceeded
thither
at
the
end
of
the
week
the
attendance
of
roger
nowell
nicholas
and
sir
ralph
assheton
was
also
required
as
witnesses
at
the
trial
of
the
witches
sir
richard
assheton
and
dorothy
had
returned
as
already
stated
to
middleton
and
though
the
intelligence
of
the
death
of
richard
and
alizon
was
communicated
to
them
with
infinite
caution
the
shock
to
both
was
very
great
especially
to
dorothy
who
was
long
very
long
in
recovering
from
it
nicholas
vivacity
of
temperament
made
him
feel
the
loss
of
his
cousin
at
first
very
keenly
but
it
soon
wore
off
he
vowed
amendment
and
reformation
on
the
model
of
john
bruen
whose
life
offered
so
striking
a
contrast
to
his
own
that
it
has
very
properly
been
placed
in
opposition
by
a
reverend
moralist
but
i
regret
to
say
that
he
did
not
carry
out
his
praiseworthy
intentions
he
was
apt
to
make
a
joke
of
john
bruen
instead
of
imitating
his
example
he
professed
to
devote
himself
to
his
excellent
wife
but
his
old
habits
would
break
out
and
i
am
sorry
to
say
he
was
often
to
be
found
in
the
alehouse
and
was
just
as
fond
of
hunting
fishing
and
all
other
sports
as
ever
occasionally
he
occupied
a
leisure
or
a
rainy
day
with
a
journal
parts
of
which
have
been
preserved
but
he
set
down
in
it
few
of
the
terrible
events
here
related
probably
because
they
were
of
too
painful
a
nature
to
be
recorded
he
died
in
at
the
early
age
of
but
to
go
back
a
few
days
after
the
tragical
events
at
hoghton
tower
the
whole
village
of
whalley
was
astir
but
it
was
no
festive
occasion
no
that
called
forth
the
inhabitants
for
grief
sat
upon
every
countenance
the
day
too
was
gloomy
the
feathered
summits
of
whalley
nab
were
wreathed
in
mist
and
a
fine
rain
descended
in
the
valley
the
calder
looked
dull
and
discoloured
as
it
flowed
past
the
walls
of
the
ancient
abbey
the
church
bell
tolled
mournfully
and
a
large
concourse
was
gathered
in
the
churchyard
not
far
from
one
of
the
three
crosses
of
paulinus
which
stood
nearest
the
church
porch
a
grave
had
been
digged
and
almost
every
one
looked
into
it
the
grave
it
was
said
was
intended
to
hold
two
coffins
soon
after
this
a
train
of
mourners
issued
from
the
ancient
abbey
gateway
and
sure
enough
there
were
two
coffins
on
the
shoulders
of
the
bearers
they
were
met
at
the
gate
by
doctor
ormerod
who
was
so
deeply
affected
as
scarcely
to
be
able
to
perform
the
needful
offices
for
the
dead
the
principal
mourners
were
sir
richard
assheton
of
middleton
sir
ralph
assheton
and
nicholas
amid
the
tears
and
sobs
of
all
the
bystanders
the
bodies
of
richard
and
alizon
were
committed
to
the
earth
laid
together
in
one
grave
thus
was
their
latest
wish
fulfilled
flowers
grew
upon
the
turf
that
covered
them
and
there
was
the
earliest
primrose
seen
and
the
latest
violet
many
a
fond
youth
and
trusting
maiden
have
visited
their
lowly
tomb
and
many
a
tear
fresh
from
the
heart

dropped

the

the
grim
and

fabric
rebuilt
and
strengthened
by
old
john
of

lancaster
within
one
of
its
turrets
called
john
of
gaunt
chair
and
at
eventide
stands
a
lady
under
the
care
of
a
jailer
it
is
the
last
sunset
she
will
ever
see
the
last
time
she
will
look
upon
the
beauties
of
earth
for
she
is
a
prisoner
condemned
to
die
an
ignominious
and
terrible
death
and
her
execution
will
take
place
on
the
morrow
leaving
her
alone
within
the
turret
the
jailer
locks
the
door
and
stands
outside
it
the
lady
casts
a
long
lingering
look
around
all
nature
seems
so
beautiful
so
attractive
the
sunset
upon
the
broad
watery
sands
of
morecambe
bay
is
exquisite
in
varied
tints
the
fells
of
furness
look
black
and
bold
and
the
windings
of
the
lune
are
clearly
traced
out
but
she
casts
a
wistful
glance
towards
the
mountainous
ridges
of
lancashire
and
fancies
she
can
detect
amongst
the
heights
the
rounded
summit
of
pendle
hill
then
her
gaze
settles
upon
the
grey
old
town
beneath
her
and
as
her
glance
wanders
over
it
certain
terrible
objects
arrest
it
in
the
area
before
the
castle
she
sees
a
ring
of
tall
stakes
she
knows
well
their
purpose
and
counts
them
they
are
thirteen
in
number
thirteen
wretched
beings
are
to
be
burned
on
the
morrow
not
far
from
the
stakes
are
an
enormous
pile
of
fagots
all
is
prepared
fascinated
by
the
sight
she
remains
gazing
at
the
place
of
execution
for
some
time
and
when
she
turns
she
beholds
a
tall
dark
man
standing
beside
her
at
first
she
thinks
it
is
the
jailer
and
is
about
to
tell
the
man
she
is
ready
to
descend
to
her
cell
when
she
recognises
him
and
recoils
in
terror
thou
here
again
she
cried
i
can
save
thee
from
the
stake
if
thou
wilt
alice
nutter
he
said
hence
she
exclaimed
thou
temptest
me
in
vain
hence
and
with
a
howl
of
rage
the
demon
disappeared
conveyed
back
to
her
cell
situated
within
the
dread
dungeon
tower
alice
nutter
passed
the
whole
of
that
night
in
prayer
towards
four
wearied
out
she
dropped
into
a
slumber
and
when
the
clergyman
from
whom
she
had
received
spiritual
consolation
came
to
her
cell
he
found
her
still
sleeping
but
with
a
sweet
smile
upon
her
lips
the
first
he
had
ever
beheld
there
unwilling
to
disturb
her
he
knelt
down
and
prayed
by
her
side
at
length
the
jailer
came
and
the
executioner
aids
the
divine
then
laid
his
hand
upon
her
shoulder
and
she
instantly
arose
i
am
ready
she
said
cheerfully
you
have
had
a
happy
dream
daughter
he
observed
a
blessed
dream
reverend
sir
she
replied
i
thought
i
saw
my
children
richard
and
alizon
in
a
fair
garden
oh
how
angelic
they
looked
and
they
told
me
i
should
be
with
them
soon
and
i
doubt
not
the
vision
will
be
realised
replied
the
clergyman
your
redemption
is
fully
worked
out
and
your
salvation
i
trust
secured
and
now
you
must
prepare
for
your
last
trial
i
am
fully
prepared
she
replied
but
will
you
not
go
to
the
others
alas
my
dear
daughter
he
replied
they
all
excepting
nance
redferne
refuse
my
services
and
will
perish
in
their
iniquities
then
go
to
her
sir
i
entreat
of
you
she
said
she
may
yet
be
saved
but
what
of
jennet
is
she
too
to
die
no
replied
the
divine
being
evidence
against
her
relatives
her
life
is
spared
heaven
grant
she
do
no
more
mischief
exclaimed
alice
nutter
she
then
submitted
herself
to
the
executioner
assistants
and
was
led
forth
on
issuing
into
the
open
air
a
change
came
over
her
and
such
an
exceeding
faintness
that
she
had
to
be
supported
she
was
led
towards
the
stake
in
this
state
but
she
grew
fainter
and
fainter
and
at
last
fell
back
in
the
arms
of
the
men
that
supported
her
still
they
carried
her
on
when
the
executioner
put
out
his
hand
to
receive
her
from
his
aids
she
was
found
to
be
quite
dead
nevertheless
he
tied
her
to
the
stake
and
her
body
was
consumed
hundreds
of
spectators
beheld
those
terrible
fires
and
exulted
in
the
torments
of
the
miserable
sufferers
their
shrieks
and
blasphemies
were
terrific
and
the
place
resembled
a
hell
upon
earth
jennet
escaped
to
the
dismay
of
master
potts
who
feared
she
would
wreak
her
threatened
vengeance
upon
him
and
indeed
he
did
suffer
from
aches
and
cramps
which
he
attributed
to
her
but
which
were
more
reasonably
supposed
to
be
owing
to
rheum
caught
in
the
marshes
of
pendle
forest
he
had
however
the
pleasure
of
assisting
at
her
execution
when
some
years
afterwards
retributive
justice
overtook
her
