the
wizard
son
chapter
i
the
methvens
occupied
a
little
house
in
the
outskirts
of
a
little
town
where
there
was
not
very
much
going
on
of
any
description
and
still
less
which
they
could
take
any
share
in
being
as
they
were
poor
and
unable
to
make
any
effective
response
to
the
civilities
shown
to
them
the
family
consisted
of
three
persons
the
mother
who
was
a
widow
with
one
son
the
son
himself
who
was
a
young
man
of
three
or
four
and
twenty
and
a
distant
cousin
of
methven
who
lived
with
her
having
no
other
home
it
was
not
a
very
happy
household
the
mother
had
a
limited
income
and
an
anxious
temper
the
son
a
somewhat
volatile
and
indolent
disposition
and
no
ambition
at
all
as
to
his
future
nor
anxiety
as
to
what
was
going
to
happen
to
him
in
life
this
as
may
be
supposed
was
enough
to
introduce
many
uneasy
elements
into
their
joint
existence
and
the
third
of
the
party
miss
merivale
was
not
of
the
class
of
the
peacemakers
to
whom
scripture
allots
a
special
blessing
she
had
no
amiable
glamour
in
her
eyes
but
saw
her
imperfections
with
a
clearness
of
sight
which
is
little
conducive
to
that
happy
progress
of
affairs
which
is
called
getting
on
the
methvens
were
sufficiently
proud
to
keep
their
difficulties
out
of
the
public
eye
but
on
very
many
occasions
unfortunately
it
had
become
very
plain
to
themselves
that
they
did
not
get
on
it
was
not
any
want
of
love
methven
was
herself
aware
and
her
friends
were
in
the
constant
habit
of
saying
that
she
had
sacrificed
everything
for
walter
injudicious
friends
are
fond
of
making
such
statements
by
way
it
is
to
be
supposed
of
increasing
the
devotion
and
gratitude
of
the
child
to
the
parent
but
the
result
is
unfortunately
very
often
the
exact
contrary
of
what
is
desired
for
no
one
likes
to
have
his
duty
in
this
respect
pointed
out
to
him
and
whatever
good
people
may
think
it
is
not
in
itself
an
agreeable
thought
that
sacrifices
have
been
made
for
one
and
an
obligation
placed
upon
one
shoulders
from
the
beginning
of
time
independent
of
any
wish
or
claim
upon
the
part
of
the
person
served
the
makers
of
sacrifices
have
seldom
the
reward
which
surrounding
spectators
and
in
many
cases
themselves
think
their
due
methven
herself
would
probably
have
been
at
a
loss
to
name
what
were
the
special
sacrifices
she
had
made
for
walter
she
had
remained
a
widow
but
that
she
would
have
been
eager
to
add
was
no
sacrifice
she
had
pinched
herself
more
or
less
to
find
the
means
for
his
education
which
had
been
of
what
is
supposed
in
england
to
be
the
best
kind
and
she
had
while
he
was
a
boy
subordinated
her
own
tastes
and
pleasures
to
his
and
eagerly
sought
out
everything
that
was
likely
to
be
agreeable
to
him
when
they
took
their
yearly
journey
as
it
is
considered
necessary
for
him
places
that
walter
liked
or
where
he
could
find
amusement
or
had
friends
were
eagerly
sought
for
women
methven
said
can
make
themselves
comfortable
anywhere
but
a
boy
you
know
is
quite
different
quite
miss
merivale
would
say
oh
if
you
only
knew
them
as
well
as
we
do
they
are
creatures
entirely
without
resources
you
must
put
their
toys
into
their
very
hands
there
is
no
question
of
toys
with
walter
he
has
plenty
of
resources
it
is
not
that
methven
would
explain
growing
red
i
hope
i
am
not
one
of
the
silly
mothers
that
thrust
their
children
upon
everybody
but
of
course
a
boy
must
be
considered
everybody
who
has
had
to
do
with
men
or
boys
knows
that
they
must
be
considered
a
woman
whose
life
has
been
mixed
up
with
these
troublesome
beings
feels
the
superiority
of
her
experience
to
those
who
know
nothing
about
them
and
in
this
way
without
spoiling
him
or
treating
him
with
ridiculous
devotion
as
the
king
of
her
fate
walter
had
been
considered
all
his
life
for
the
rest
methven
had
it
must
be
allowed
lived
a
much
more
agreeable
life
in
the
little
society
of
sloebury
when
her
son
was
young
than
she
did
now
that
he
had
come
to
years
of
discretion
then
she
had
given
her
little
or
even
a
small
occasional
dinner
at
which
her
handsome
boy
would
make
his
appearance
when
it
was
holiday
time
interesting
everybody
or
when
absent
would
still
furnish
a
very
pleasant
subject
of
talk
to
the
neighbours
who
thought
his
mother
did
a
great
deal
too
much
for
him
but
still
were
pleased
to
discuss
a
boy
who
was
having
the
best
of
educations
and
at
a
public
school
in
those
days
she
felt
herself
very
comfortable
in
sloebury
and
was
asked
to
all
the
best
houses
and
felt
a
modest
pride
in
the
certainty
that
she
was
able
to
offer
something
in
return
but
matters
were
very
different
when
walter
was
instead
of
fourteen
by
that
time
it
was
apparent
that
he
was
not
going
to
take
the
world
by
storm
or
set
the
thames
on
fire
and
though
she
had
been
too
sensible
to
brag
methven
had
thought
both
these
things
possible
and
perhaps
had
allowed
it
to
be
perceived
that
she
considered
something
great
something
out
of
the
way
to
be
walter
certain
career
but
is
as
she
said
herself
so
different
he
had
been
unsuccessful
in
some
of
his
examinations
and
for
others
he
had
not
been
properly
prepared
his
mother
did
not
take
refuge
in
the
thought
that
the
examiners
were
partial
or
the
trials
unfair
but
there
was
naturally
always
a
word
as
to
the
reason
why
he
did
not
succeed
he
had
not
been
properly
prepared
he
knew
of
one
only
a
few
days
before
the
eventful
moment
and
at
this
time
of
day
she
asked
indignantly
when
everything
is
got
by
competition
how
is
a
young
man
who
has
not
crammed
to
get
the
better
of
one
who
has
the
fact
remained
that
at
walter
evidently
a
clever
fellow
with
a
great
many
endowments
had
got
nothing
to
do
and
what
was
worse
a
thing
which
his
mother
indeed
pretended
to
be
unconscious
of
but
which
everybody
else
in
the
town
remarked
upon
he
was
not
in
the
least
concerned
about
this
fact
but
took
his
doing
nothing
quite
calmly
as
the
course
of
nature
and
neither
suffered
from
it
nor
made
any
effort
to
place
himself
in
a
different
position
he
went
in
for
an
examination
when
it
was
put
before
him
as
a
thing
to
do
and
took
his
failure
more
than
philosophically
when
he
failed
as
as
yet
he
had
always
done
and
in
the
mean
time
contentedly
lived
on
without
disturbing
himself
and
tranquilly
let
the
time
go
by
the
golden
time
which
should
have
shaped
his
life
this
is
not
a
state
of
affairs
which
can
bring
happiness
to
any
household
there
is
a
kind
of
parent
or
rather
it
should
be
said
of
a
mother
for
no
parent
of
the
other
sex
is
supposed
capable
of
so
much
folly
to
whom
everything
is
good
that
her
child
the
cherished
object
of
her
affections
does
and
this
is
a
most
happy
regulation
of
nature
and
smooths
away
the
greatest
difficulties
of
life
for
many
folk
without
doing
half
so
much
harm
as
is
attributed
to
it
for
disapproval
has
little
moral
effect
and
lessens
the
happiness
of
all
parties
without
materially
lessening
the
sins
of
the
erring
but
unfortunately
methven
was
not
of
this
happy
kind
she
saw
her
son
faults
almost
too
clearly
and
they
gave
her
the
most
poignant
pain
she
was
a
proud
woman
and
that
he
should
suffer
in
the
opinion
of
the
world
was
misery
and
grief
to
her
she
was
stung
to
the
heart
by
disappointment
in
the
failure
of
her
many
hopes
and
projects
for
him
she
was
stricken
with
shame
to
think
of
all
the
fine
things
that
had
been
predicted
of
walter
in
his
boyish
days
and
that
not
one
of
them
had
come
true
people
had
ceased
now
to
speak
of
the
great
things
that
walter
would
do
they
asked
was
he
going
to
do
in
an
entirely
altered
tone
and
this
went
to
her
heart
her
pride
suffered
the
most
terrible
blow
she
could
not
bear
the
thought
and
though
she
maintained
a
calm
face
to
the
world
and
represented
herself
as
entirely
satisfied
walter
knew
otherwise
and
had
gradually
replaced
his
old
careless
affection
for
his
mother
by
an
embittered
opposition
and
resistance
to
her
which
made
both
their
lives
wretched
enough
how
it
was
that
he
did
not
make
an
effort
to
escape
from
her
continual
remonstrances
her
appeals
and
entreaties
her
censure
and
criticism
it
is
very
difficult
to
tell
to
have
gone
away
and
torn
her
heart
with
anxiety
but
emancipated
himself
from
a
yoke
which
it
was
against
the
dignity
of
his
manhood
to
bear
would
have
been
much
more
natural
but
he
had
no
money
and
he
had
not
the
energy
to
seize
upon
any
way
of
providing
for
himself
had
such
an
opportunity
fallen
at
his
feet
he
would
probably
have
accepted
it
with
fervour
but
fortune
did
not
put
herself
out
of
the
way
to
provide
for
him
nor
he
to
be
provided
for
notwithstanding
the
many
scenes
which
took
place
in
the
seclusion
of
that
poor
little
house
when
the
mother
what
with
love
shame
mortification
and
impatience
would
all
but
rave
in
impotent
passion
appealing
to
him
to
the
pride
the
ambition
the
principle
which
so
far
as
could
be
seen
the
young
man
did
not
possess
walter
held
upon
his
way
with
an
obstinate
pertinacity
and
did
nothing
how
he
managed
to
do
this
without
losing
all
and
every
better
feeling
it
is
impossible
to
say
but
he
did
so
somehow
and
was
still
a
nice
enough
fellow
notwithstanding
that
everybody
condemned
him
and
had
not
even
lost
the
good
opinion
of
the
little
society
though
it
was
unanimous
in
blame
the
only
way
in
which
he
responded
to
his
mother
remonstrances
and
complaints
was
by
seeking
his
pleasure
and
such
occupation
as
contented
him
which
was
a
little
cricket
now
and
then
a
little
a
little
flirtation
as
far
away
from
her
as
possible
and
by
being
as
little
at
home
as
possible
his
temper
was
a
little
spoilt
by
the
scenes
which
awaited
him
when
he
went
home
and
these
seemed
to
justify
to
himself
his
gradual
separation
from
his
mother
house
but
never
induced
him
to
sacrifice
or
even
modify
his
own
course
he
appeared
to
think
that
he
had
a
justification
for
his
conduct
in
the
opposition
it
met
with
and
that
his
pride
was
involved
in
the
necessity
for
never
giving
in
if
he
had
been
let
alone
he
represented
to
himself
everything
would
have
been
different
but
to
yield
to
this
perpetual
bullying
was
against
every
instinct
and
even
the
society
which
disapproved
so
much
gave
a
certain
encouragement
to
walter
in
this
point
of
view
for
it
was
methven
whom
everybody
blamed
it
was
her
ridiculous
pride
or
her
foolish
indulgence
or
her
sinful
of
his
natural
indolence
even
some
people
thought
it
was
her
want
of
comprehension
of
her
son
which
had
done
it
and
that
walter
would
have
been
entirely
a
different
person
in
different
hands
if
she
had
not
thought
it
a
fine
thing
to
have
him
appear
as
a
useless
fine
gentleman
above
all
necessity
of
working
for
his
living
it
was
incredible
that
he
could
have
allowed
the
years
to
steal
by
without
making
any
exertion
this
was
what
the
town
decided
not
without
a
good
deal
of
sympathy
for
walter
what
could
be
expected
under
the
guidance
of
a
foolish
mother
a
young
man
always
went
wrong
and
in
this
case
he
did
not
go
wrong
poor
fellow
he
only
wasted
his
existence
nothing
worse
sloebury
had
much
consideration
for
the
young
man
perhaps
it
added
something
to
the
exasperation
with
which
methven
saw
all
her
efforts
fail
that
she
had
some
perception
of
this
and
knew
that
it
was
supposed
to
be
her
fault
no
doubt
in
her
soul
it
added
to
the
impatience
and
indignation
and
pain
with
which
she
contemplated
the
course
of
affairs
which
she
was
without
strength
to
combat
yet
could
not
let
alone
now
and
then
indeed
she
did
control
herself
so
far
as
to
let
them
alone
and
then
there
was
nothing
but
tranquillity
and
peace
in
the
house
but
she
was
a
conscientious
woman
and
poor
soul
she
had
a
temper
the
very
complacency
and
calm
with
which
her
son
went
upon
his
way
the
approval
he
showed
of
her
better
conduct
when
she
left
him
to
his
own
devices
struck
her
in
some
moments
with
such
sudden
indignation
and
pain
that
she
could
no
longer
contain
herself
he
who
might
have
been
anything
he
pleased
to
be
nothing
he
of
whom
everybody
had
predicted
such
great
things
at
such
moments
the
sight
of
walter
smiling
strolling
along
with
his
hands
in
his
pockets
excited
her
almost
to
frenzy
poor
lady
so
many
women
would
have
been
proud
of
him
a
handsome
young
fellow
in
flannels
with
his
cricket
bat
or
his
racquet
when
occasion
served
but
love
and
injured
pride
were
bitter
in
her
heart
and
she
could
not
bear
the
sight
all
this
while
however
nobody
knew
anything
about
the
scenes
that
arose
in
the
little
house
which
preserved
a
show
of
happiness
and
tender
union
long
after
the
reality
was
gone
indeed
even
miss
merivale
who
had
unbounded
opportunities
of
knowing
took
a
long
time
to
make
up
her
mind
that
walter
and
his
mother
did
not
get
on
such
was
the
unfortunate
state
of
affairs
at
the
time
when
this
history
begins
the
methvens
were
distantly
connected
it
was
known
with
a
great
family
in
scotland
which
took
no
notice
whatever
of
them
and
indeed
had
very
little
reason
so
to
do
captain
methven
being
long
since
dead
and
his
widow
and
child
entirely
unknown
to
the
noble
house
from
which
it
was
so
great
an
honour
to
derive
a
little
drop
of
blood
more
blue
and
more
rich
than
the
common
it
is
possible
that
had
the
connection
been
by
methven
side
she
would
have
known
more
about
it
and
taken
more
trouble
to
keep
up
her
knowledge
of
the
family
but
it
was
not
so
and
she
had
even
in
her
younger
days
been
conscious
of
little
slights
and
neglects
which
had
made
her
rather
hostile
than
otherwise
to
the
great
people
from
whom
her
husband
came
i
know
nothing
about
the
erradeens
she
would
say
they
are
much
too
grand
to
take
any
notice
of
us
and
i
am
too
proud
to
seek
any
notice
from
them
i
am
afraid
my
dear
there
is
a
good
deal
in
that
said
old
wynn
the
wife
of
the
old
rector
shaking
her
white
head
this
lady
was
a
sort
of
benign
embodiment
of
justice
in
sloebury
she
punished
nobody
but
she
saw
the
right
and
wrong
with
a
glance
that
was
almost
infallible
and
shook
her
head
though
she
never
exacted
any
penalty
here
miss
merivale
would
seize
the
occasion
to
strike
in
prejudice
is
prejudice
she
said
whatever
form
it
takes
a
lord
has
just
as
much
chance
of
being
nice
as
an
apothecary
this
was
said
because
the
young
doctor
newly
admitted
into
his
father
business
who
thought
no
little
of
himself
was
within
reach
and
just
then
caught
miss
merivale
eye
that
is
a
very
safe
speech
seeing
there
are
neither
lords
nor
apothecaries
here
he
said
with
the
blandest
smile
he
was
not
a
man
to
be
beaten
at
such
a
game
but
a
lord
may
have
influence
you
know
for
walter
sake
i
would
not
lose
sight
of
him
said
wynn
you
can
not
lose
sight
of
what
you
have
never
seen
besides
influence
is
of
no
consequence
nowadays
nobody
can
do
anything
for
you
save
yourself
said
methven
with
a
little
sigh
her
eyes
turned
involuntarily
to
where
walter
was
he
was
always
in
the
middle
of
everything
that
was
going
on
among
the
sloebury
young
people
he
had
a
little
air
of
distinction
or
so
at
least
his
mother
thought
she
was
painfully
impartial
and
generally
in
her
anxiety
perceived
his
bad
points
rather
than
his
good
ones
but
as
she
glanced
at
the
group
love
for
once
allowed
itself
to
speak
though
always
with
an
accent
peculiar
to
the
character
of
the
thinker
she
allowed
to
herself
that
he
had
an
air
of
distinction
a
something
more
than
the
others
alas
that
nothing
ever
came
of
it
the
others
all
or
almost
all
were
already
launched
in
the
world
they
were
doing
or
trying
to
do
something
whereas
walter
but
she
took
care
that
nobody
should
hear
that
irrepressible
sigh
i
am
very
sorry
for
it
said
wynn
for
there
are
many
people
who
would
never
push
for
themselves
and
yet
do
very
well
indeed
when
they
are
put
in
the
way
i
am
all
for
the
pushing
people
said
miss
merivale
i
like
the
new
state
of
affairs
when
every
one
stands
for
himself
and
you
get
just
as
much
as
you
work
for
there
will
be
no
grudges
and
sulkings
with
society
though
i
a
tory
i
like
every
man
to
make
his
own
way
a
lady
politics
are
never
to
be
calculated
upon
said
the
rector
who
was
standing
up
against
the
fire
on
his
own
hearth
rubbing
his
old
white
hands
it
is
altogether
against
the
principles
of
toryism
my
dear
lady
that
a
man
should
make
his
own
way
it
is
sheer
democracy
as
for
that
method
of
examinations
it
is
one
of
the
most
levelling
principles
of
the
time
it
is
one
of
gladstone
instruments
for
the
destruction
of
society
when
the
son
of
a
cobbler
is
just
as
likely
to
come
to
high
command
as
your
son
or
mine
what
is
to
become
of
the
country
the
old
clergyman
said
lifting
those
thin
white
hands
gladstone
name
was
as
a
firebrand
thrown
into
the
midst
of
this
peaceable
little
country
community
the
speakers
all
took
fire
they
thought
that
there
was
no
doubt
about
what
was
going
to
come
of
the
country
it
was
going
to
destruction
as
fast
as
fate
could
carry
it
when
society
had
dropped
to
pieces
and
the
rabble
had
come
uppermost
and
england
had
become
a
mere
name
upon
which
all
foreign
nations
should
trample
and
wild
irishmen
dance
war
dances
and
americans
expectorate
then
gladstone
would
be
seen
in
his
true
colours
while
this
was
going
on
old
wynn
sat
in
her
and
shook
her
head
she
declared
always
that
she
was
no
politician
and
young
walter
methven
attracted
by
the
sudden
quickening
of
the
conversation
which
naturally
attended
the
introduction
of
this
subject
came
forward
ready
in
the
vein
of
opposition
which
was
always
his
favourite
attitude
gladstone
must
be
a
very
great
man
he
said
i
hear
it
is
a
sign
of
being
in
society
when
you
foam
at
the
mouth
at
the
sound
of
his
name
you
young
fellows
think
it
fine
to
be
on
the
popular
side
but
wait
till
you
are
my
age
cried
one
of
the
eager
speakers
it
will
not
matter
much
to
me
there
will
be
peace
in
my
days
but
wait
cried
another
and
see
how
you
will
like
it
when
everything
topples
down
together
the
crown
and
the
state
and
the
aristocracy
and
public
credit
and
national
honour
and
property
and
the
constitution
and
so
many
anxious
and
alarmed
politicians
here
spoke
together
that
the
general
voice
became
inarticulate
and
walter
methven
representing
the
opposition
was
at
liberty
to
laugh
come
one
come
all
he
cried
backed
up
by
the
arm
of
the
sofa
upon
which
wynn
sat
shaking
her
head
it
would
be
a
fine
thing
for
me
and
all
the
other
proletarians
something
would
surely
fall
our
way
his
mother
watched
him
standing
up
against
the
sofa
confronting
them
all
with
her
usual
exasperated
and
angry
affection
she
thought
as
she
looked
at
him
that
there
was
nothing
he
was
not
fit
for
he
was
clever
enough
for
parliament
he
might
have
been
prime
minister
but
he
was
nothing
nothing
and
likely
to
be
nothing
doing
nothing
desiring
nothing
her
eye
fell
on
young
wynn
the
rector
nephew
who
had
just
got
a
fellowship
at
his
college
and
on
the
doctor
son
who
was
just
entering
into
a
share
of
his
father
practice
and
on
jeremy
the
young
banker
whose
attentions
fluttered
any
maiden
to
whom
he
might
address
them
they
were
walter
contemporaries
and
not
one
of
them
was
worthy
she
thought
to
be
seen
by
the
side
of
her
boy
but
they
had
all
got
before
him
in
the
race
of
life
they
were
something
and
he
was
nothing
it
was
not
much
wonder
if
her
heart
was
sore
and
angry
when
she
turned
round
to
listen
civilly
to
something
that
was
said
to
her
her
face
was
contracted
and
pale
it
was
more
than
she
could
bear
she
made
a
move
to
go
away
before
any
of
the
party
was
ready
and
disturbed
miss
merivale
in
the
midst
of
a
which
was
a
thing
not
easily
forgiven
walter
walked
home
with
them
in
great
good
humour
but
his
mother
knew
very
well
that
he
was
not
coming
in
he
was
going
to
finish
the
evening
elsewhere
if
he
had
come
in
would
she
have
been
able
to
restrain
herself
would
she
not
have
fallen
upon
him
either
in
anger
or
in
grief
holding
up
to
him
the
examples
of
young
wynn
and
young
jeremy
and
the
little
doctor
she
knew
she
would
not
have
been
able
to
refrain
and
it
was
almost
a
relief
to
her
though
it
was
another
pang
when
he
turned
away
at
the
door
i
want
to
speak
to
underwood
about
he
said
what
is
there
about
of
all
the
people
in
sloebury
captain
underwood
is
the
one
i
like
least
she
said
why
must
you
always
have
something
to
say
to
him
when
every
one
else
is
going
to
bed
i
am
not
going
to
bed
nor
is
he
said
walter
lightly
methven
nerves
were
highly
strung
miss
merivale
had
passed
in
before
them
and
there
was
nobody
to
witness
this
little
struggle
which
she
knew
would
end
in
nothing
but
which
was
inevitable
she
grasped
him
by
the
arm
in
her
eagerness
and
pain
oh
my
boy
she
said
come
in
come
in
and
think
of
something
more
than
the
amusement
of
life
is
not
all
play
though
you
seem
to
think
so
for
once
listen
to
me
walter
oh
listen
to
me
you
can
not
go
on
like
this
think
of
all
the
others
all
at
work
every
one
of
them
and
you
doing
nothing
do
you
want
me
to
begin
to
do
something
now
said
walter
when
you
have
just
told
me
everybody
was
going
to
bed
oh
if
i
were
you
she
cried
in
her
excitement
i
would
rest
neither
night
nor
day
i
would
not
let
it
be
said
that
i
was
the
last
and
every
one
of
them
before
me
walter
shook
himself
free
of
her
detaining
hold
am
i
to
be
a
dustman
or
a
scavenger
or
what
he
said
contemptuously
i
know
no
other
trades
that
are
followed
at
this
hour
methven
had
reached
the
point
at
which
a
woman
has
much
ado
not
to
cry
in
the
sense
of
impotence
and
exasperation
which
such
an
argument
brings
it
is
better
to
do
anything
than
to
do
nothing
she
cried
turning
away
from
him
and
hastening
in
at
the
open
door
he
paused
a
moment
as
if
doubtful
what
to
do
there
was
something
in
her
hasty
withdrawal
which
for
an
instant
disposed
him
to
follow
and
she
paused
breathless
with
a
kind
of
hope
in
the
of
the
little
hall
but
the
next
moment
his
footsteps
sounded
clear
and
quick
on
the
pavement
going
away
methven
waited
until
they
were
almost
out
of
hearing
before
she
closed
the
door
angry
baffled
helpless
what
could
she
do
she
wiped
a
hot
tear
from
the
corner
of
her
eye
before
she
went
into
the
where
her
companion
always
on
the
alert
had
already
turned
up
the
light
of
the
lamp
throwing
an
undesired
illumination
upon
her
face
flushed
and
troubled
from
this
brief
controversy
i
thought
you
were
never
coming
in
said
miss
merivale
and
that
open
door
sends
a
draught
all
through
the
house
walter
detained
me
for
a
moment
to
explain
some
arrangements
he
has
to
make
for
methven
said
with
dignity
he
likes
to
keep
me
of
his
proceedings
miss
merivale
was
absolutely
silenced
by
this
sublime
assumption
notwithstanding
the
flush
of
resentment
the
glimmer
of
moisture
in
the
mother
eye
chapter
ii
walter
walked
along
the
quiet
almost
deserted
street
with
a
hasty
step
and
a
still
hastier
rush
of
disagreeable
thoughts
there
was
he
felt
an
advantage
in
being
angry
in
the
sensation
of
indignant
resistance
to
a
petty
tyranny
for
a
long
time
past
he
had
taken
refuge
in
this
from
every
touch
of
conscience
and
sense
of
time
lost
and
opportunities
neglected
he
was
no
genius
but
he
was
not
so
dull
as
not
to
know
that
his
life
was
an
entirely
unsatisfactory
one
and
himself
in
the
wrong
altogether
everything
rotten
in
the
state
of
his
existence
and
a
great
deal
that
must
be
set
right
one
time
or
another
in
all
his
habits
and
ways
the
misfortune
was
that
it
was
so
much
easier
to
put
off
this
process
till
than
to
begin
it
he
had
never
been
roused
out
of
the
boyish
condition
of
mind
in
which
a
certain
resistance
to
authority
was
natural
and
opposition
to
maternal
rule
and
law
a
sort
of
proof
of
superiority
and
independence
had
this
been
put
into
words
and
placed
before
him
as
the
motive
of
much
that
he
did
no
one
would
have
coloured
more
angrily
or
resented
more
hotly
the
suggestion
and
yet
in
the
bottom
of
his
heart
he
would
have
known
it
to
be
true
all
through
his
unoccupied
days
he
carried
with
him
the
sense
of
folly
the
consciousness
that
he
could
not
justify
to
himself
the
course
he
was
pursuing
the
daily
necessity
of
justifying
it
to
another
was
almost
the
sole
thing
that
silenced
his
conscience
his
mother
who
kept
nagging
day
after
day
who
was
never
satisfied
whose
appeals
he
sometimes
thought
theatrical
and
her
passion
got
up
was
his
sole
defence
against
that
which
is
the
severest
of
all
criticisms
if
she
would
but
let
him
alone
leave
him
to
his
own
initiative
and
not
perpetually
endeavour
to
force
a
change
which
to
be
effectual
as
all
authorities
agreed
must
come
of
itself
he
was
quite
conscious
of
the
inadequacy
of
this
argument
and
in
his
heart
felt
that
it
was
a
poor
thing
to
take
advantage
of
it
but
yet
on
the
surface
of
his
mind
put
it
forward
and
made
a
bulwark
of
it
against
his
own
conscience
he
did
so
now
as
he
hurried
along
in
all
the
heat
that
follows
a
personal
encounter
if
she
would
but
let
him
alone
but
he
could
not
move
a
step
anywhere
could
not
make
an
engagement
could
not
step
into
a
rooms
as
he
was
going
to
do
now
without
her
interference
the
relations
of
a
parent
to
an
only
child
are
not
the
same
as
those
that
exist
between
a
father
and
mother
and
the
different
members
of
a
large
family
it
has
been
usual
to
consider
them
in
one
particular
light
as
implying
the
closest
union
and
mutual
devotion
but
there
is
another
point
of
view
in
which
to
consider
the
question
they
are
so
near
to
each
other
and
the
relationship
so
close
that
there
is
a
possibility
of
opposition
and
contrariety
more
trying
more
absorbing
than
any
other
except
that
between
husband
and
wife
a
young
son
does
not
always
see
the
necessity
of
devotion
to
a
mother
who
is
not
very
old
who
has
still
many
sources
of
pleasure
apart
from
himself
and
who
is
not
capable
perhaps
on
her
side
of
the
undiscriminating
worship
which
is
grandmotherly
and
implies
a
certain
weakness
and
dimness
of
perception
in
the
fond
eyes
that
see
everything
in
a
rosy
ideal
light
this
fond
delusion
is
often
in
its
way
a
moral
agent
obliging
the
object
of
it
to
fulfil
what
is
expected
of
him
and
reward
the
full
and
perfect
trust
which
is
given
so
unhesitatingly
but
in
this
case
it
was
not
possible
the
young
man
thought
or
persuaded
himself
that
his
mother
vexatious
watch
over
him
and
what
he
called
her
constant
suspicion
and
doubt
of
him
had
given
him
a
reason
for
the
disgust
and
impatience
with
which
he
turned
from
her
control
he
pictured
to
himself
the
difference
which
a
father
larger
more
generous
sway
would
have
made
in
him
to
that
he
would
have
answered
he
thought
like
a
ship
to
its
helm
like
an
army
to
its
general
but
this
petty
rule
this
perpetual
raised
up
every
faculty
in
opposition
even
when
he
meant
the
best
her
words
of
warning
her
reminders
of
duty
were
enough
to
set
him
all
wrong
again
he
thought
as
a
bad
husband
often
thinks
when
he
is
conscious
of
the
world
disapproval
that
it
was
her
complaints
that
were
the
cause
and
when
he
was
reminded
by
others
but
injudicious
of
all
he
owed
to
his
mother
his
mind
rose
yet
more
strongly
in
opposition
his
spirit
refused
the
claim
this
is
a
very
different
picture
from
that
of
the
widow
son
whose
earliest
inspiration
is
his
sense
of
duty
to
his
mother
and
adoring
gratitude
for
her
care
and
love
but
it
is
perhaps
as
true
a
one
a
young
man
may
be
placed
in
an
unfair
position
by
the
excessive
claim
made
upon
his
heart
and
conscience
in
this
way
and
so
walter
felt
it
he
might
have
given
all
that
and
more
if
nothing
had
been
asked
of
him
but
when
he
was
expected
to
feel
so
much
he
felt
himself
half
justified
in
feeling
nothing
thus
the
situation
had
become
one
of
strained
and
continual
opposition
it
was
a
kind
of
duel
in
which
the
younger
combatant
at
least
the
assailed
person
whose
and
independence
were
hampered
by
such
perpetual
requirements
never
yielded
a
step
the
other
might
do
so
by
turns
throwing
up
her
arms
altogether
but
not
he
it
was
with
this
feeling
strong
in
his
mind
and
affecting
his
temper
as
nothing
else
does
to
such
a
degree
that
he
hastened
along
the
street
towards
the
rooms
occupied
by
captain
underwood
a
personage
whom
the
ladies
of
sloebury
were
unanimous
in
disliking
nobody
knew
exactly
where
it
was
that
he
got
his
military
title
he
did
not
belong
to
any
regiment
in
her
majesty
service
he
had
not
even
the
humble
claim
of
a
militia
officer
yet
nobody
dared
say
that
there
was
anything
fictitious
about
him
or
stigmatise
the
captain
as
an
impostor
other
captains
and
colonels
and
of
undoubted
character
supported
his
claims
he
belonged
to
one
or
two
clubs
an
angry
woman
would
sometimes
fling
an
insult
at
him
when
her
husband
or
son
came
home
penniless
after
an
evening
in
his
company
wondering
what
they
could
see
in
an
fellow
who
was
no
more
a
captain
she
would
say
in
her
wrath
than
she
was
but
of
these
assertions
there
was
no
proof
and
the
vehemence
of
them
naturally
made
the
captain
partisans
more
and
more
eager
in
his
favour
he
had
not
been
above
six
months
in
sloebury
but
everybody
knew
him
there
was
scarcely
an
evening
in
which
men
did
not
congregate
in
his
rooms
drawn
together
by
that
strange
attraction
which
makes
people
meet
who
do
not
care
in
the
least
for
each
other
company
nor
have
anything
to
say
to
each
other
yet
are
possibly
less
vacant
in
society
than
when
alone
or
find
the
murmur
of
many
voices
the
smoke
of
many
cigars
exhilarating
and
agreeable
it
was
not
every
evening
that
the
cards
were
produced
the
captain
was
wary
he
frightened
nobody
he
did
not
wish
to
give
occasion
to
the
tremors
of
the
ladies
whom
he
would
have
conciliated
even
if
he
had
been
able
but
there
are
men
against
whom
the
instinct
of
all
women
rises
as
there
are
women
from
whom
all
men
turn
it
was
only
now
and
then
that
he
permitted
play
he
spoke
indeed
strongly
against
it
on
many
occasions
what
do
you
want
with
cards
he
would
say
a
good
cigar
and
a
friend
to
talk
to
ought
to
be
enough
for
any
man
but
twice
or
thrice
in
a
week
his
scruples
would
give
way
he
was
a
tall
man
of
an
uncertain
age
with
burning
hazel
eyes
and
a
scar
on
his
forehead
got
in
that
mysterious
service
to
which
now
and
then
he
made
allusion
and
which
his
friends
concluded
must
have
been
in
some
foreign
legion
or
with
garibaldi
or
some
other
irregular
warfare
there
were
some
who
thought
him
a
man
old
for
his
age
of
and
some
who
concluding
him
young
for
his
age
and
well
preserved
credited
him
with
twenty
years
more
but
or
whichever
it
was
he
was
erect
and
strong
and
well
set
up
and
possessed
an
amount
of
experience
and
apparent
knowledge
of
the
world
at
which
the
striplings
of
sloebury
admired
and
wondered
and
which
even
the
older
men
respected
as
men
in
the
country
respect
the
mention
of
great
names
and
incidents
that
have
become
historical
he
had
a
way
of
recommending
himself
even
to
the
serious
and
would
now
and
then
break
forth
as
if
reluctantly
into
an
account
of
some
instance
of
faith
or
patience
on
the
battlefield
or
the
hospital
which
made
even
the
rector
declare
that
to
consider
underwood
as
an
irreligious
man
was
both
unjust
and
unkind
so
strong
was
the
prejudice
of
the
women
however
that
wynn
always
charitable
and
whose
silent
protest
was
generally
only
made
when
the
absent
were
blamed
shook
her
head
at
this
testimony
borne
in
favour
of
the
captain
she
had
no
son
to
be
led
away
and
her
husband
it
need
not
be
said
considering
his
position
was
invulnerable
but
with
all
her
charity
she
could
not
believe
in
the
religion
of
captain
underwood
his
rooms
were
very
nice
rooms
in
the
best
street
in
sloebury
and
if
his
society
was
what
is
called
mixed
yet
the
best
people
were
occasionally
to
be
met
there
as
well
as
those
who
were
not
the
best
there
was
a
little
stir
in
the
company
when
walter
entered
to
tell
the
truth
notwithstanding
the
wild
mirth
and
dissipation
which
the
ladies
believed
to
go
on
in
captain
underwood
rooms
the
society
assembled
there
was
at
the
moment
dull
and
in
want
of
a
sensation
there
had
not
been
anything
said
for
the
course
of
two
minutes
at
least
there
was
no
play
going
on
and
the
solemn
puff
of
smoke
from
one
pair
of
lips
after
another
would
have
been
the
height
of
monotony
had
it
not
been
the
wildest
fun
and
gratification
the
men
in
the
room
took
pipes
and
cigars
out
of
their
mouths
to
welcome
the
hallo
walter
they
all
said
in
different
tones
for
in
sloebury
the
use
of
christian
names
was
universal
everybody
having
known
everybody
else
since
the
moment
of
their
birth
here
comes
methven
said
the
owner
of
the
rooms
it
was
one
of
his
charms
in
the
eyes
of
the
younger
men
that
he
was
not
addicted
to
this
familiarity
in
the
odour
of
sanctity
it
will
do
us
all
good
to
have
an
account
of
the
rector
party
how
did
you
leave
the
old
ladies
my
excellent
boy
stole
away
like
the
fox
by
jove
said
the
hunting
man
who
was
the
pride
of
sloebury
more
like
the
mouse
with
the
old
cats
after
it
said
another
wit
now
walter
had
come
in
among
them
strong
in
his
sense
of
right
and
in
his
sense
of
wrong
feeling
himself
at
the
same
moment
a
sorry
fool
and
an
injured
hero
a
sufferer
for
the
rights
of
man
and
it
would
have
been
of
great
use
to
him
in
both
these
respects
to
have
felt
himself
step
into
a
superior
atmosphere
into
the
heat
of
a
political
discussion
or
even
into
noisy
amusement
or
the
passion
of
play
anything
which
would
rouse
the
spirits
and
energies
and
show
the
action
of
a
larger
life
but
to
feel
his
own
arrival
a
sort
of
godsend
in
the
dulness
and
to
hear
nothing
but
the
heavy
puff
of
all
the
smoke
and
the
very
poor
wit
with
which
he
was
received
was
sadly
disconcerting
and
made
him
more
and
more
angry
with
himself
and
the
circumstances
which
would
give
him
no
sort
of
support
or
comfort
the
old
ladies
he
said
were
rather
more
lively
than
you
fellows
you
look
as
if
you
had
all
been
poisoned
in
your
wine
like
the
men
in
the
opera
and
expected
the
wall
to
open
and
the
monks
and
the
coffins
to
come
in
i
knew
that
methven
would
bring
us
some
excellent
lesson
said
captain
underwood
remember
that
we
have
all
to
die
think
my
friends
upon
your
latter
end
jump
up
here
and
give
us
a
sermon
wat
do
tease
him
he
dangerous
the
old
ladies
have
been
too
much
for
him
this
went
on
till
walter
had
settled
down
into
his
place
and
lighted
his
pipe
like
the
rest
he
looked
upon
them
with
disenchanted
eyes
not
that
he
had
ever
entertained
any
very
exalted
opinion
of
his
company
but
he
was
out
of
sympathy
with
all
his
surroundings
and
he
felt
it
almost
a
personal
offence
that
there
should
be
so
little
to
attract
and
excite
in
this
manly
circle
which
thought
so
much
more
of
itself
than
of
any
other
and
was
so
scornful
of
the
old
ladies
who
after
all
were
not
old
ladies
but
the
graver
members
of
the
community
in
general
with
an
ornamental
adjunct
of
young
womankind
on
ordinary
occasions
no
doubt
walter
would
have
chimed
in
with
the
rest
but
he
was
dissatisfied
and
miserable
not
sure
of
any
sensation
in
particular
but
one
of
scorn
and
distaste
for
his
surroundings
he
would
have
felt
this
in
almost
any
conceivable
case
but
in
the
midst
of
this
poor
jesting
and
wit
the
effect
was
doubled
was
it
worth
while
for
this
to
waste
his
time
to
offend
the
opinion
of
all
his
friends
such
thoughts
must
always
come
in
similar
circumstances
even
in
the
most
brilliant
revelry
there
will
be
a
pause
a
survey
of
the
position
a
sense
however
unwilling
that
the
game
is
not
worth
the
candle
but
here
they
were
all
as
dull
as
ditch
water
he
said
to
himself
separately
there
was
scarcely
one
whom
he
would
have
selected
as
an
agreeable
companion
and
was
it
possible
by
joining
many
dulnesses
together
to
produce
a
brilliant
result
there
was
no
doubt
that
judgment
was
jaundiced
that
evening
for
he
was
not
by
any
means
so
contemptuous
of
his
friends
on
ordinary
occasions
but
he
had
been
eager
to
find
an
excuse
for
himself
to
be
able
to
say
that
here
was
real
life
and
genial
society
in
place
of
the
affected
solemnity
of
the
proper
people
when
he
found
himself
unable
to
do
this
he
was
struck
as
by
a
personal
grievance
and
sat
moody
and
abstracted
bringing
a
chill
upon
everybody
till
one
by
one
the
boon
companions
strolled
away
a
pretty
set
of
fellows
to
talk
of
dulness
he
cried
with
a
little
burst
as
if
they
were
not
dull
beyond
all
description
themselves
come
methven
you
are
out
of
temper
said
captain
underwood
they
are
good
fellows
enough
when
you
are
in
the
vein
for
them
something
has
put
you
out
of
joint
nothing
at
all
cried
walter
except
the
sight
of
you
all
sitting
as
solemn
as
owls
pretending
to
enjoy
yourselves
at
the
rectory
one
yawned
indeed
it
was
the
genius
of
the
place
but
to
hear
all
those
dull
dogs
laughing
at
that
as
if
they
were
not
a
few
degrees
worse
is
there
nothing
but
dulness
in
life
is
everything
the
same
one
way
or
another
and
nothing
to
show
for
it
all
when
it
is
over
but
tediousness
and
discontent
underwood
looked
at
him
keenly
with
his
fiery
eyes
so
you
come
to
that
already
have
you
he
said
i
thought
you
were
too
young
and
foolish
i
am
not
so
young
as
not
to
know
that
i
am
behaving
like
an
idiot
walter
said
perhaps
he
had
a
little
hope
of
being
contradicted
and
brought
back
to
his
own
esteem
but
instead
of
this
captain
underwood
only
looked
at
him
again
and
laughed
i
know
he
said
the
conscience
has
its
tremors
especially
after
an
evening
at
the
rectory
you
see
how
well
respectability
looks
how
comfortable
it
is
i
do
nothing
of
the
sort
walter
cried
indignantly
i
see
how
dull
you
are
you
people
who
scoff
at
respectability
and
i
begin
to
wonder
whether
it
is
not
better
to
be
dull
and
thrive
than
to
be
dull
and
perish
they
seem
much
the
same
thing
so
far
as
enjoyment
goes
you
want
excitement
said
the
other
carelessly
i
allow
there
is
not
much
of
that
here
i
want
something
cried
walter
cards
even
are
better
than
nothing
i
want
to
feel
that
i
have
blood
in
my
veins
my
dear
boy
all
that
is
easily
explained
you
want
money
money
is
the
thing
that
mounts
the
blood
in
the
veins
with
money
you
can
have
as
much
excitement
as
much
movement
as
you
like
let
people
say
what
they
please
there
is
nothing
else
that
does
it
said
the
man
of
experience
he
took
a
choice
cigar
leisurely
from
his
case
as
he
spoke
a
bit
of
a
country
town
like
this
what
can
you
expect
from
it
there
is
no
go
in
them
they
risk
a
shilling
and
go
away
frightened
if
they
lose
if
they
do
go
to
church
on
sunday
they
feel
all
the
remorse
of
a
villain
in
a
play
it
all
petty
here
everything
petty
both
the
vices
and
the
virtues
i
do
wonder
you
find
it
slow
what
i
find
it
i
say
why
do
you
stop
here
then
said
walter
not
unnaturally
with
a
momentary
stare
of
surprise
then
he
resumed
being
full
of
his
own
subject
i
know
i
an
ass
he
said
i
loaf
about
here
doing
nothing
when
i
ought
to
be
at
work
i
do
know
why
i
do
it
but
neither
do
i
know
how
to
get
out
of
it
you
that
quite
another
thing
you
have
no
call
to
stay
i
wonder
you
do
why
do
you
if
i
were
as
free
as
you
i
should
be
off
before
another
day
come
along
then
said
underwood
i
go
if
go
at
this
walter
shook
his
head
i
have
no
money
you
know
i
ought
to
be
in
an
office
or
doing
something
i
ca
go
off
to
shoot
here
or
fish
there
like
you
by
and
by
by
and
by
you
have
time
enough
to
wait
walter
gave
him
a
look
of
surprise
there
is
nothing
to
wait
for
he
said
is
that
why
you
have
said
so
many
things
to
me
about
seeing
life
i
have
nothing
we
got
no
money
in
the
family
i
may
wait
till
doomsday
but
it
will
do
nothing
for
me
do
be
too
sure
of
that
said
underwood
oh
you
need
devour
me
with
your
eyes
i
know
nothing
of
your
family
affairs
i
suppose
of
course
that
by
and
by
in
the
course
of
nature
you
mean
said
walter
turning
pale
when
my
mother
dies
no
i
not
such
a
wretched
cad
as
that
if
i
did
know
i
should
get
next
to
nothing
then
i
his
conscience
nearly
tripped
this
young
man
up
running
into
his
way
so
hurriedly
that
he
caught
his
foot
unawares
then
he
stopped
and
grew
red
staring
at
his
companion
most
of
what
she
has
dies
with
her
if
that
what
you
thinking
of
there
is
nothing
in
that
to
build
upon
and
i
glad
of
it
the
young
man
cried
i
beg
your
pardon
methven
said
the
other
but
it
need
be
that
there
are
other
ways
of
getting
rich
i
do
know
any
of
them
unless
by
work
and
how
am
i
to
work
it
is
so
easy
to
speak
what
can
i
work
at
and
where
am
i
to
get
it
there
is
the
question
i
hear
enough
on
that
subject
as
if
i
were
a
tailor
or
a
shoemaker
that
could
find
something
to
do
at
any
corner
there
is
no
reason
in
it
the
young
man
said
so
hotly
and
with
such
a
flush
of
resentful
obstinacy
that
the
fervour
of
his
speech
betrayed
him
he
was
like
a
man
who
had
outrun
himself
and
paused
out
of
breath
you
see
something
will
turn
up
said
underwood
with
a
laugh
what
can
turn
up
nothing
suppose
i
go
to
new
zealand
and
come
back
at
fifty
with
my
fortune
made
fifty
just
the
age
is
it
to
begin
to
enjoy
yourself
cried
walter
scornfully
when
you
have
not
a
tooth
left
nor
a
faculty
perfect
he
was
so
young
that
the
appeared
to
him
like
the
age
of
methusaleh
and
men
who
lived
to
that
period
as
having
outlived
all
that
is
worth
living
for
his
mentor
laughed
a
little
uneasily
as
if
he
had
been
touched
by
this
chance
shot
it
is
not
such
a
terrible
age
after
all
he
said
a
man
can
still
enjoy
himself
when
he
is
fifty
but
i
grant
you
that
at
a
long
time
to
wait
for
your
pleasure
however
let
us
hope
something
will
turn
up
before
then
supposing
for
the
sake
of
argument
you
were
to
come
in
to
your
fortune
more
speedily
i
wonder
what
you
would
do
with
it
eh
you
are
such
a
terrible
fellow
for
excitement
the
turf
all
that
is
folly
said
walter
getting
up
abruptly
nothing
more
thanks
i
am
coming
in
to
no
fortune
and
you
do
understand
me
a
bit
he
said
turning
at
the
door
of
the
room
to
look
back
upon
the
scene
where
he
had
himself
spent
so
many
hours
made
piquant
by
a
sense
of
that
wrongdoing
which
supplies
excitement
when
other
motives
fail
the
chairs
standing
about
as
their
occupants
had
thrust
them
away
from
the
table
the
empty
glasses
upon
it
the
disorder
of
the
room
struck
him
with
a
certain
sense
of
disgust
it
was
a
room
intended
by
nature
to
be
orderly
and
sober
with
heavy
furniture
and
nothing
about
it
that
could
throw
any
grace
on
disarray
the
master
of
the
place
stood
against
the
table
swaying
a
somewhat
heavy
figure
over
it
and
gazing
at
the
young
man
with
his
fiery
eyes
walter
rudeness
did
not
please
him
any
more
than
his
abrupt
withdrawal
do
be
too
sure
of
that
he
said
with
an
effort
to
retain
his
aspect
if
i
do
understand
you
i
should
like
to
know
who
does
and
when
that
fortune
comes
you
will
remember
what
i
say
pshaw
walter
cried
impatiently
turning
away
a
nod
of
his
head
was
all
the
he
gave
he
hurried
down
as
he
had
hurried
up
still
as
little
contented
as
full
of
dissatisfaction
as
when
he
came
this
man
who
thought
he
understood
him
who
intended
to
influence
him
revolted
the
young
man
uneasy
sense
of
independence
as
much
as
did
the
bond
of
more
lawful
authority
did
underwood
think
him
a
child
not
able
to
guide
himself
it
was
very
late
by
this
time
and
the
streets
very
silent
he
walked
quickly
home
through
the
wintry
darkness
of
november
with
a
mind
as
thoroughly
out
of
tune
as
it
is
possible
to
imagine
he
had
gone
to
underwood
in
the
hot
impulse
of
opposition
with
the
hope
of
getting
rid
temporarily
at
least
of
the
struggle
within
him
but
he
had
not
got
rid
of
it
the
dull
jokes
of
the
assembled
company
had
only
made
the
raging
of
the
inward
storm
more
sensible
and
the
jaunty
and
presumptuous
misconception
with
which
his
host
received
his
involuntary
confidences
afterwards
had
aggravated
instead
of
soothing
his
mind
indeed
underwood
pretence
at
knowing
all
about
it
his
guesses
and
attempts
to
sound
his
companion
mind
and
the
blundering
interpretation
of
it
into
which
he
stumbled
filled
walter
with
double
indignation
and
disgust
this
man
too
he
had
thought
much
of
and
expected
superior
intelligence
from
and
all
that
he
had
to
say
was
an
idiotic
anticipation
of
some
miraculous
coming
into
a
fortune
which
walter
was
aware
was
as
likely
to
happen
to
the
beggar
on
the
streets
as
to
himself
he
had
been
angry
with
nature
and
his
mother
when
he
left
her
door
he
was
angry
with
everybody
when
he
returned
to
it
though
his
chief
anger
of
all
and
the
root
of
all
the
others
was
that
anger
with
himself
which
burnt
within
his
veins
and
which
is
the
hardest
of
all
others
to
quench
out
chapter
iii
walter
was
very
late
next
morning
as
he
had
been
very
late
at
night
the
ladies
had
breakfasted
long
before
and
there
was
a
look
of
reproach
in
the
very
left
there
so
much
after
the
usual
time
and
scrupulously
cleared
of
everything
that
the
others
had
used
and
arranged
at
one
end
with
the
dish
kept
hot
for
him
and
the
small
teapot
just
big
enough
for
one
which
was
a
sermon
in
itself
his
mother
was
seated
by
the
fire
with
her
weekly
books
which
she
was
adding
up
she
said
scarcely
anything
to
him
except
the
morning
greeting
filling
out
his
tea
with
a
gravity
which
was
all
the
more
crushing
that
there
was
nothing
in
it
to
object
to
nothing
to
resent
adding
up
accounts
of
itself
is
not
cheerful
work
but
naturally
the
young
man
resented
this
seriousness
all
the
more
because
he
had
no
right
to
do
so
it
was
intolerable
he
felt
to
sit
and
eat
in
presence
of
that
silent
figure
partly
turned
away
from
him
jotting
down
the
different
amounts
on
a
bit
of
paper
and
absorbed
in
that
occupation
as
if
unconscious
of
his
presence
even
scolding
was
better
than
this
walter
was
perfectly
conscious
of
all
it
was
in
her
power
to
say
he
knew
by
heart
her
remonstrances
and
appeals
but
he
disliked
the
silence
more
than
all
he
longed
to
take
her
by
the
shoulders
and
cry
what
is
it
what
have
you
got
to
say
to
me
what
do
you
mean
by
sitting
there
like
a
stone
figure
and
it
all
the
same
he
did
not
do
this
knowing
it
would
be
foolish
and
gave
his
constant
antagonist
a
certain
advantage
but
he
longed
to
get
rid
of
some
of
his
own
exasperation
by
such
an
act
it
was
with
a
kind
of
force
over
himself
that
he
ate
his
breakfast
going
through
all
the
forms
prolonging
it
to
the
utmost
of
his
power
helping
himself
with
deliberate
solemnity
in
defiance
of
the
spectator
who
seemed
so
absorbed
in
her
own
occupation
but
was
he
felt
sure
watching
his
every
movement
it
was
not
however
until
he
had
come
to
an
end
of
his
prolonged
meal
and
of
his
newspaper
that
his
mother
spoke
do
you
think
she
said
that
it
would
be
possible
for
you
to
write
that
letter
to
milnathort
of
which
i
have
spoken
so
often
oh
quite
possible
said
walter
carelessly
will
you
do
it
then
it
seems
to
me
very
important
to
your
interests
will
you
really
do
it
and
do
it
i
see
about
it
walter
said
i
do
ask
you
to
see
about
it
it
is
nothing
very
difficult
i
ask
you
to
do
it
at
once
he
gazed
at
her
for
a
moment
with
an
angry
obstinacy
i
see
no
particular
occasion
for
all
this
haste
it
has
stood
over
a
good
many
days
why
should
you
insist
so
upon
it
now
every
day
that
it
has
been
put
off
has
been
a
mistake
it
should
have
been
done
at
once
methven
said
i
see
about
it
he
said
carelessly
and
he
went
out
of
the
room
with
a
sense
of
having
exasperated
her
as
usual
which
was
almost
pleasant
at
the
bottom
of
his
heart
he
meant
to
do
what
his
mother
had
asked
of
him
but
he
would
not
betray
his
good
intentions
he
preferred
to
look
hostile
even
when
he
was
in
the
mind
to
be
obedient
he
went
away
to
the
little
which
was
appropriated
to
him
where
his
pipes
adorned
the
mantelpiece
and
sat
down
to
consider
the
situation
to
write
a
letter
was
not
a
great
thing
to
do
and
he
fully
meant
to
do
it
but
after
he
had
mused
a
little
angrily
upon
the
want
of
perception
which
made
his
mother
adopt
that
cold
and
hectoring
tone
when
if
she
had
asked
him
gently
he
would
have
done
it
in
a
minute
he
put
forth
his
hand
and
drew
a
book
towards
him
it
was
not
either
a
new
or
an
entertaining
book
but
it
secured
his
idle
attention
until
he
suddenly
remembered
that
it
was
time
to
go
out
the
letter
was
not
written
but
what
did
that
matter
the
post
did
not
go
out
till
the
afternoon
and
there
was
plenty
of
time
between
that
time
and
this
to
write
letters
it
would
do
very
well
he
thought
when
he
came
in
for
lunch
so
he
threw
down
the
book
and
got
his
hat
and
went
out
methven
who
was
on
the
watch
hearing
his
every
movement
came
into
his
room
after
he
was
gone
and
looked
round
with
eager
eyes
to
see
if
the
letter
was
written
if
there
was
any
trace
of
it
perhaps
he
had
taken
it
out
with
him
to
post
it
she
thought
and
though
it
was
injurious
to
her
that
she
should
not
know
something
more
about
a
piece
of
business
in
which
he
was
not
the
sole
person
concerned
yet
it
gave
her
a
sort
of
relief
to
think
that
so
much
at
least
he
had
done
she
went
back
to
her
books
with
an
easier
mind
she
was
far
from
being
a
rich
woman
but
her
son
had
known
none
of
her
little
difficulties
her
efforts
to
make
ends
meet
she
had
thought
it
wrong
to
trouble
his
childhood
with
such
confidences
and
he
had
grown
up
thinking
nothing
on
the
subject
without
any
particular
knowledge
of
or
interest
in
her
affairs
taking
everything
for
granted
it
was
her
own
fault
she
said
to
herself
and
so
it
was
to
some
extent
she
would
sometimes
think
that
if
she
had
it
to
do
over
again
she
would
change
all
that
how
often
do
we
think
this
and
with
what
bitter
regret
in
respect
to
the
children
whom
people
speak
of
as
wax
in
our
hands
till
we
suddenly
wake
up
and
find
them
iron
she
had
kept
her
difficulties
out
of
walter
way
and
instead
of
being
grateful
to
her
for
so
doing
he
was
simply
indifferent
neither
inquiring
nor
caring
to
know
her
own
doing
it
was
easier
to
herself
yet
bitter
beyond
telling
to
acknowledge
it
to
be
so
just
at
this
time
when
christmas
was
approaching
the
ends
took
a
great
deal
of
tugging
and
coaxing
to
bring
them
together
a
few
of
walter
bills
had
come
in
unexpectedly
putting
her
poor
balance
altogether
wrong
miss
merivale
contributed
a
little
but
only
a
little
to
the
housekeeping
for
methven
was
both
proud
and
liberal
and
understood
giving
better
than
receiving
she
went
back
to
the
where
all
her
books
lay
upon
the
table
near
the
fire
her
reckoning
had
advanced
much
since
she
had
begun
it
with
walter
sitting
at
breakfast
her
faculties
had
been
all
absorbed
in
him
and
what
he
was
doing
now
she
addressed
herself
to
her
accounts
with
a
strenuous
effort
it
is
hard
work
to
balance
a
small
sum
of
money
against
a
large
number
of
bills
to
settle
how
to
divide
it
so
as
that
everybody
shall
have
something
and
the
mouths
of
hungry
creditors
be
stopped
perhaps
we
might
say
that
this
was
one
of
the
fine
arts
so
many
pounds
here
so
many
there
keeping
credit
afloat
and
the
wolf
of
debt
from
the
door
methven
was
skilled
in
it
she
went
to
this
work
feeling
all
its
difficulty
and
burden
yet
with
a
little
relief
not
because
she
saw
any
way
out
of
her
difficulties
but
because
walter
had
written
that
letter
it
was
always
something
done
she
thought
in
her
simplicity
and
something
might
come
of
it
some
way
in
which
he
could
get
the
means
of
exercising
his
faculties
perhaps
of
distinguishing
himself
even
yet
walter
for
his
part
strolled
away
through
the
little
town
in
his
usual
easy
way
it
was
a
fine
bright
winterly
morning
not
cold
yet
cold
enough
to
make
brisk
walking
pleasant
and
stir
the
blood
in
young
veins
there
was
no
football
going
on
nor
any
special
amusement
he
could
not
afford
to
hunt
and
the
only
active
winter
exercise
which
he
could
attain
was
limited
to
this
game
of
which
there
was
a
good
deal
at
sloebury
and
skating
when
it
pleased
providence
to
send
ice
which
was
too
seldom
he
looked
in
upon
one
or
two
of
his
cronies
and
played
a
game
of
billiards
and
hung
about
the
high
street
to
see
what
was
going
on
there
was
nothing
particular
going
on
but
the
air
was
fresh
and
the
sun
shining
and
a
little
pleasant
movement
about
much
more
agreeable
at
least
than
sitting
in
a
stuffy
little
room
writing
a
troublesome
letter
which
he
felt
sure
would
not
do
the
least
good
finally
he
met
captain
underwood
who
regarded
him
with
a
look
which
walter
would
have
called
anxious
had
he
been
able
to
imagine
any
possible
reason
why
underwood
should
entertain
any
anxiety
on
his
account
well
any
news
the
captain
cried
news
what
news
should
there
be
in
this
place
walter
said
the
other
looked
at
him
keenly
as
if
to
see
whether
he
was
quite
sincere
and
then
said
come
and
have
some
lunch
he
was
free
of
all
the
best
resorts
in
sloebury
this
mysterious
man
he
belonged
to
the
club
he
was
greatly
at
his
ease
in
the
hotel
everything
was
open
to
him
walter
who
had
but
little
money
of
his
own
and
could
not
quite
cut
the
figure
he
wished
was
not
displeased
to
be
thus
exhibited
as
the
captain
foremost
ally
i
thought
you
might
have
come
into
that
fortune
you
are
looking
so
spruce
the
captain
said
and
laughed
but
though
he
laughed
he
kept
an
eye
on
the
young
man
as
if
the
pleasantry
meant
more
than
appeared
walter
felt
a
momentary
irritation
with
this
which
seemed
to
him
a
very
bad
joke
but
he
went
with
the
captain
all
the
same
not
without
a
recollection
of
the
table
at
home
at
which
after
waiting
three
quarters
of
an
hour
or
so
and
watching
at
the
window
for
his
coming
the
ladies
would
at
last
sit
down
but
he
was
not
a
child
to
be
forced
to
attendance
at
every
meal
he
said
to
himself
the
attentions
to
him
were
great
and
it
was
a
very
nice
little
meal
that
they
had
together
i
expect
you
to
do
great
things
for
me
when
you
come
into
your
fortune
you
had
better
engage
me
at
once
as
your
guide
philosopher
and
friend
he
said
with
a
laugh
of
course
you
will
quit
sloebury
and
make
yourself
free
of
all
this
bondage
oh
of
course
said
walter
humouring
the
joke
though
it
was
so
bad
a
one
in
every
way
he
could
not
quarrel
with
his
host
at
his
own
table
and
perhaps
after
all
it
was
more
dignified
to
take
it
with
good
humour
you
must
not
go
in
for
mere
expense
the
captain
said
you
must
make
it
pay
i
can
put
you
up
to
a
thing
or
two
you
must
not
go
into
the
world
like
a
pigeon
to
be
plucked
it
would
effect
my
personal
honour
if
a
pupil
of
mine
for
i
consider
you
as
a
pupil
of
mine
methven
i
think
i
have
imparted
to
you
a
thing
or
two
you
are
not
quite
the
simpleton
you
used
to
be
do
you
think
you
are
walter
received
this
with
great
gravity
though
he
tried
to
look
as
if
he
were
not
offended
was
i
a
simpleton
he
said
i
suppose
in
one
own
case
one
never
sees
were
you
a
simpleton
said
the
other
with
a
laugh
and
then
he
stopped
himself
always
keenly
watching
the
young
man
face
and
perceiving
that
he
was
going
too
far
but
i
flatter
myself
you
could
hold
your
own
at
whist
with
any
man
now
the
captain
said
this
pleased
the
young
man
his
gravity
unbended
a
little
there
was
a
visible
relaxation
of
the
corners
of
his
mouth
to
be
praised
is
always
agreeable
moral
applause
indeed
may
be
taken
with
composure
but
who
could
hear
himself
applauded
for
his
without
an
exhilaration
of
the
heart
he
said
with
satisfaction
i
always
was
pretty
good
at
games
at
which
his
instructor
laughed
again
almost
too
much
for
perfect
good
breeding
i
like
to
have
young
fellows
like
you
to
deal
with
he
said
fellows
with
a
little
spirit
that
are
born
for
better
things
your
young
man
is
as
fretful
and
frightened
when
he
loses
a
few
shillings
as
if
it
were
thousands
but
that
one
of
the
reasons
why
i
feel
you
born
to
luck
my
boy
i
know
a
man
of
liberal
breeding
whenever
i
see
him
he
is
not
frightened
about
a
nothing
that
one
of
the
things
i
like
in
you
methven
you
deserve
a
fortune
and
you
deserve
to
have
me
for
your
guide
philosopher
and
friend
all
this
was
said
by
way
of
joke
but
it
was
strange
to
see
the
steady
watch
which
he
kept
on
the
young
man
face
one
would
have
said
a
person
of
importance
whom
underwood
meant
to
try
his
strength
with
but
guardedly
without
going
too
far
and
even
on
whom
he
was
somehow
dependent
anxious
to
make
a
good
impression
walter
who
knew
his
own
favour
to
be
absolutely
without
importance
and
that
underwood
above
all
his
host
and
frequent
entertainer
could
be
under
no
possible
delusion
on
the
subject
was
puzzled
yet
flattered
feeling
that
only
some
excellence
on
his
part
undiscovered
by
any
of
his
other
acquaintances
could
account
for
this
so
experienced
a
person
could
have
no
motive
in
thus
paying
court
to
a
penniless
and
prospectless
youth
walter
was
perplexed
but
he
was
gratified
too
he
had
not
seen
many
of
the
captain
kind
nobody
who
knew
so
many
people
or
who
was
so
much
at
his
ease
with
the
world
admiration
of
this
vast
acquaintance
and
of
the
familiarity
with
which
the
captain
treated
things
and
people
of
which
others
spoke
with
bated
breath
had
varied
in
his
mind
with
a
fluctuating
sense
that
underwood
was
not
exactly
so
elevated
a
person
as
he
professed
to
be
and
even
that
there
were
occasional
vulgarities
in
this
man
of
the
world
walter
felt
these
but
in
his
ignorance
represented
to
himself
that
perhaps
they
were
right
enough
and
only
seemed
vulgar
to
him
who
knew
no
better
and
there
is
no
doubt
he
was
somewhat
intoxicated
by
this
flattery
it
must
be
disinterested
for
what
could
he
do
for
anybody
he
confided
to
the
captain
more
than
he
had
ever
done
before
of
his
own
position
he
described
how
he
was
being
urged
to
write
to
old
milnathort
he
is
an
old
lawyer
in
scotland
what
they
call
a
writer
and
it
is
supposed
he
might
be
induced
to
take
me
into
his
office
for
the
sake
of
old
associations
i
do
know
what
the
associations
are
but
the
position
does
not
smile
upon
me
walter
said
your
family
then
is
a
scotch
family
said
the
captain
with
a
nod
of
approval
i
thought
as
much
i
do
know
that
i
got
a
family
said
walter
on
the
contrary
methven
is
a
very
good
name
there
are
baronets
at
least
and
a
peer
you
must
have
heard
of
him
lord
erradeen
oh
yes
i
heard
of
him
walter
said
with
a
conscious
look
if
he
had
been
more
in
the
world
he
would
have
said
he
is
a
cousin
of
mine
but
he
was
aware
that
the
strain
of
kindred
was
very
far
off
and
he
was
at
once
too
shy
and
too
proud
to
claim
it
his
companion
waited
apparently
for
the
disclosure
then
finding
it
did
not
come
opened
the
way
if
he
a
relation
of
yours
it
to
him
you
ought
to
write
very
likely
he
would
do
something
for
you
they
are
a
curious
family
had
occasion
to
know
something
about
them
i
think
you
know
everybody
underwood
well
i
have
knocked
about
the
world
a
great
deal
in
that
way
one
comes
across
a
great
many
people
i
saw
a
good
deal
of
the
present
lord
at
one
time
he
was
a
very
queer
man
they
are
all
queer
if
you
are
one
of
them
you
have
to
bear
your
share
in
it
there
is
a
mysterious
house
they
have
you
would
think
i
was
an
idiot
if
i
told
you
half
the
stories
i
have
heard
about
the
erradeens
about
everybody
said
the
captain
evasively
there
is
scarcely
a
family
that
if
you
go
right
into
it
has
not
something
curious
about
them
we
all
have
but
those
that
last
and
continue
keep
it
on
record
i
could
tell
you
the
wildest
tales
about
and
very
ordinary
people
to
look
at
but
with
stories
that
would
make
your
hair
stand
on
end
we
have
nothing
to
do
with
things
of
that
sort
my
people
have
always
been
straightforward
and
for
as
much
as
you
know
perhaps
but
go
back
three
or
four
generations
and
how
can
you
tell
we
have
all
of
us
ancestors
that
perhaps
were
not
much
to
brag
of
walter
caught
underwood
eye
as
he
said
this
and
perhaps
there
was
a
twinkle
in
it
for
he
laughed
it
is
something
he
said
to
have
ancestors
at
all
if
they
were
the
greatest
blackguards
in
the
world
the
captain
said
with
a
responsive
laugh
that
what
i
think
you
do
want
any
more
of
my
revelations
well
never
mind
probably
i
shall
have
you
coming
to
me
some
of
these
days
quite
humbly
to
beg
for
more
information
you
are
not
cut
out
for
an
attorney
office
it
is
very
virtuous
of
course
to
give
yourself
up
to
work
and
turn
your
back
upon
life
virtue
be
hanged
said
walter
with
some
excitement
it
is
not
virtue
but
necessity
which
i
take
to
be
the
very
opposite
i
know
wasting
my
time
but
i
mean
to
turn
over
a
new
leaf
and
as
the
first
evidence
of
that
as
soon
as
i
go
home
i
shall
write
to
old
milnathort
not
said
underwood
looking
at
his
watch
the
post
has
gone
hours
more
to
think
about
it
will
do
you
no
harm
walter
started
to
his
feet
and
it
was
with
a
real
pang
that
he
saw
how
the
opportunity
had
escaped
him
and
his
intention
in
spite
of
himself
been
balked
a
flush
of
shame
came
over
his
face
he
felt
that
if
never
before
here
was
a
genuine
occasion
for
blame
to
be
sure
the
same
thing
had
happened
often
enough
before
but
he
had
never
perhaps
so
fully
intended
to
do
what
was
required
of
him
he
sat
down
again
with
a
muttered
curse
at
himself
and
his
own
folly
there
was
nothing
to
be
said
for
him
he
had
meant
to
turn
over
a
new
leaf
and
yet
this
day
was
just
like
the
last
the
thought
made
his
heart
sick
for
the
moment
but
what
was
the
use
of
making
a
fuss
and
betraying
himself
to
a
stranger
he
sat
down
again
with
a
which
made
him
glad
to
escape
from
his
own
company
underwood
talk
might
be
shallow
enough
perhaps
his
pretence
at
knowledge
was
not
very
well
founded
but
he
was
safer
company
than
conscience
and
that
burning
and
miserable
sense
of
moral
impotence
which
is
almost
worse
than
the
more
tragic
stings
of
conscience
to
find
out
that
your
resolution
is
worth
nothing
after
you
have
put
yourself
to
the
trouble
of
making
it
and
that
habit
is
more
strong
than
any
motive
is
not
a
pleasant
thing
to
think
of
better
let
the
captain
talk
about
lord
erradeen
or
any
other
lord
in
the
peerage
underwood
being
encouraged
with
a
few
questions
talked
very
largely
on
this
subject
he
gave
the
young
man
many
pieces
of
information
which
indeed
he
could
have
got
in
debrett
if
he
had
been
anxious
on
the
subject
and
as
the
afternoon
wore
on
they
strolled
out
again
for
another
promenade
up
and
down
the
more
populous
parts
of
sloebury
and
there
fell
in
with
other
idlers
like
themselves
and
when
the
twilight
yielded
to
the
more
cheerful
light
of
the
lamps
betook
themselves
to
whist
which
was
sometimes
played
in
the
captain
rooms
at
that
immoral
hour
sloebury
even
the
most
advanced
portion
of
it
had
been
horrified
at
the
thought
of
whist
before
dinner
when
the
captain
first
suggested
it
but
that
innocent
alarm
had
long
since
melted
away
there
was
nothing
dangerous
about
it
no
stakes
which
any
one
could
be
hurt
by
losing
when
walter
warned
by
the
breaking
up
of
the
party
that
it
was
the
hour
for
dinner
took
his
way
home
also
he
was
the
winner
of
a
sixpence
or
two
and
no
more
there
had
been
nothing
wrong
in
the
play
but
when
he
turned
the
corner
of
underwood
street
and
found
himself
with
the
wind
in
his
face
on
his
way
home
the
revulsion
of
feeling
from
something
like
gaiety
to
a
rush
of
disagreeable
anticipations
a
crowd
of
uncomfortable
thoughts
was
pitiful
in
spite
of
all
our
boastings
of
home
and
home
influence
how
many
experience
this
change
the
moment
they
turn
their
face
in
the
direction
of
that
centre
where
it
is
conventional
to
suppose
all
comfort
and
shelter
is
there
is
a
chill
an
abandonment
of
pleasant
sensations
a
preparation
for
those
that
are
not
pleasant
walter
foresaw
what
he
would
find
there
with
an
impatience
and
resentment
which
were
almost
intolerable
behind
the
curtain
between
the
laths
of
the
venetian
blind
his
mother
would
be
secretly
on
the
outlook
watching
for
his
return
perhaps
even
she
had
stolen
quietly
to
the
door
and
sheltered
in
the
darkness
of
the
porch
was
looking
out
or
if
not
that
the
maid
who
opened
the
door
would
look
reproachfully
at
him
and
ask
if
he
was
going
to
dress
or
if
she
might
serve
the
dinner
at
once
it
must
have
been
waiting
already
nearly
half
an
hour
he
went
on
very
quickly
but
his
thoughts
lingered
and
struggled
with
the
strong
disinclination
that
possessed
him
how
much
he
would
have
given
not
to
go
home
at
all
how
little
pleasure
he
expected
when
he
got
there
his
mother
most
likely
would
be
silent
pale
with
anger
saying
little
while
cousin
sophia
would
get
up
a
little
conversation
she
would
talk
lightly
about
anything
that
might
have
been
happening
and
walter
would
perhaps
exert
himself
to
give
sophia
back
her
own
and
show
his
mother
that
he
cared
nothing
about
her
displeasure
and
then
when
dinner
was
over
he
would
hurry
out
again
glad
to
be
released
home
this
was
what
it
had
come
to
be
and
nothing
could
mend
it
so
far
as
either
mother
or
son
could
see
oh
terrible
incompatibility
unapproachableness
of
one
soul
to
another
to
think
that
they
should
be
so
near
yet
so
far
away
even
in
the
case
of
husband
and
wife
the
severance
is
scarcely
so
terrible
for
they
have
come
towards
each
other
out
of
different
spheres
and
if
they
do
not
amalgamate
there
are
many
secondary
causes
that
may
be
blamed
differences
of
nature
and
training
and
thought
but
a
mother
with
her
child
whom
she
has
brought
up
whose
first
opinions
she
has
implanted
who
ought
naturally
to
be
influenced
by
her
ways
of
thinking
and
even
by
prejudices
and
superstitions
in
favour
of
her
way
it
was
not
however
this
view
of
the
question
which
moved
the
young
man
it
was
the
fact
of
his
own
bondage
the
compulsion
he
was
under
to
return
to
dinner
to
give
some
partial
obedience
to
the
rules
of
the
house
and
to
confess
that
he
had
not
written
that
letter
to
milnathort
when
he
came
in
sight
of
the
house
however
he
became
aware
insensibly
he
could
scarcely
tell
how
of
some
change
in
its
aspect
what
was
it
it
was
lighted
up
in
the
most
unusual
way
the
window
of
the
spare
room
was
shining
not
only
with
candlelight
but
with
firelight
his
own
room
was
lighted
up
the
door
was
standing
open
throwing
out
a
warm
flood
of
light
into
the
street
and
in
the
centre
of
this
light
stood
methven
with
her
white
shawl
over
her
head
not
at
all
concealing
herself
gazing
anxiously
in
the
direction
from
which
he
was
coming
i
think
i
will
send
for
him
he
heard
her
say
he
has
very
likely
stepped
into
captain
underwood
and
he
is
apt
to
meet
friends
there
who
will
not
let
him
go
her
voice
was
soft
there
was
no
blame
in
it
though
she
was
anxious
she
was
speaking
to
some
one
behind
her
a
figure
in
a
great
coat
walter
was
in
the
shadow
and
invisible
he
paused
in
his
surprise
to
listen
i
must
get
away
by
the
last
train
he
heard
the
voice
of
the
muffled
figure
say
somewhat
pettishly
oh
there
is
plenty
of
time
for
that
cried
his
mother
and
then
she
gave
a
little
cry
of
pleasure
and
said
and
at
a
good
moment
here
he
is
he
came
in
somewhat
dazzled
and
much
astonished
into
the
strong
light
in
the
open
doorway
methven
countenance
was
all
radiant
and
glowing
with
pleasure
she
held
out
her
hand
to
him
eagerly
we
have
been
looking
for
you
she
cried
i
have
had
a
great
surprise
walter
this
is
mr
milnathort
puzzled
startled
and
yet
somewhat
disappointed
walter
paused
in
the
hall
and
looked
at
a
tall
old
man
with
a
face
full
of
crotchets
and
intelligence
who
stood
with
two
great
coats
unbuttoned
and
a
comforter
half
unwound
from
his
throat
under
the
lamp
his
features
were
high
and
thin
his
eyes
invisible
under
their
deep
sockets
now
you
will
surely
take
off
your
coat
and
consent
to
go
and
make
yourself
comfortable
said
methven
with
a
thrill
of
excitement
in
her
voice
this
is
walter
he
has
heard
of
you
all
his
life
without
any
reference
to
the
nature
of
your
communication
he
must
be
glad
indeed
to
make
your
acquaintance
she
gave
walter
a
look
of
appeal
as
she
spoke
he
was
so
much
surprised
that
it
was
with
difficulty
he
found
to
murmur
a
few
words
of
civility
a
feeling
that
milnathort
must
have
come
to
look
after
that
letter
which
had
never
been
written
came
in
with
the
most
wonderfully
confusing
half
ludicrous
effect
into
his
mind
like
one
of
the
inadequate
motives
and
ineffable
conclusions
of
a
dream
milnathort
made
a
stiff
little
bow
in
reply
i
will
remain
till
the
last
train
in
the
mean
time
the
young
gentleman
had
better
be
informed
mrs
methven
she
put
out
her
hands
again
a
moment
give
us
a
moment
first
the
old
lawyer
stood
still
and
looked
from
the
mother
to
the
son
perhaps
to
his
keen
eyes
it
was
revealed
that
it
would
be
well
she
should
have
the
advantage
of
any
pleasant
revelation
i
will
he
said
madam
avail
myself
of
your
kind
offer
to
go
and
unroll
myself
out
of
these
trappings
of
a
long
journey
and
in
the
mean
time
you
will
perhaps
like
to
tell
him
the
news
yourself
he
will
like
it
all
the
better
if
he
hears
it
from
his
mother
methven
bowed
her
head
having
apparently
no
words
at
her
command
and
stood
looking
after
him
till
he
disappeared
on
the
stairs
following
the
maid
who
had
been
waiting
with
a
candle
lighted
in
her
hand
when
he
was
gone
she
seized
walter
hurriedly
by
the
arm
and
drew
him
towards
the
little
room
the
nearest
which
was
his
ordinary
her
hand
grasped
him
with
unnecessary
force
in
her
excitement
the
room
was
dark
he
could
not
see
her
face
the
only
light
in
it
being
the
reflection
of
the
lamp
outside
oh
walter
she
cried
oh
my
boy
i
do
know
how
to
tell
you
the
news
this
useless
life
is
all
over
for
you
and
another
oh
how
different
another
god
grant
it
happy
and
great
oh
god
grant
it
blessed
and
noble
her
voice
choked
with
excitement
and
tears
she
drew
him
towards
her
into
her
arms
it
will
take
you
from
me
but
what
of
that
if
it
makes
you
happy
and
good
i
have
been
no
guide
to
you
but
god
will
be
your
guide
his
leadings
were
all
dark
to
me
but
now
i
see
mother
he
cried
with
a
strange
impulse
he
could
not
understand
putting
his
arm
round
her
i
did
not
write
that
letter
i
have
done
nothing
i
promised
or
meant
to
do
i
am
sick
to
the
heart
to
think
what
a
fool
and
a
cad
i
am
for
the
love
of
god
tell
me
what
it
is
chapter
iv
all
sloebury
was
aware
next
morning
that
something
of
the
most
extraordinary
character
had
happened
to
young
walter
methven
the
rumour
even
reached
the
club
on
the
same
evening
first
the
report
was
that
he
had
got
a
valuable
appointment
at
which
the
gentlemen
shook
their
heads
next
that
he
had
come
into
a
fortune
they
laughed
with
one
accord
at
this
then
as
upon
a
sudden
gale
of
wind
there
blew
into
the
then
full
of
tobacco
newspapers
and
men
a
whisper
which
made
everybody
turn
pale
this
was
one
reason
if
not
the
chief
why
that
evening
was
one
of
the
shortest
ever
known
at
the
club
which
did
not
indeed
generally
keep
very
late
hours
but
still
was
occupied
by
its
till
ten
or
eleven
when
the
serious
members
would
go
away
leaving
only
the
boys
who
never
could
have
enough
of
it
but
on
that
evening
even
the
young
men
cleared
off
about
ten
or
so
they
wanted
to
know
what
it
meant
some
of
them
went
round
to
captain
where
walter
was
so
often
to
be
found
with
a
confidence
that
at
least
underwood
would
know
the
more
respectable
members
of
society
went
home
to
their
families
to
spread
the
news
and
mothers
at
least
went
to
bed
that
night
with
a
disagreeable
recollection
that
they
had
individually
and
deliberately
broken
off
an
incipient
flirtation
or
more
in
which
walter
had
been
one
of
the
parties
concerned
but
the
hopeful
ones
said
to
themselves
lizzie
has
but
to
hold
up
her
little
finger
to
bring
him
back
this
was
before
the
whole
was
known
the
young
men
who
had
hurried
to
captain
underwood
were
received
by
that
gentleman
with
an
air
of
importance
and
of
knowing
more
than
he
would
tell
which
impressed
their
imaginations
deeply
he
allowed
that
he
had
always
known
that
there
was
a
great
deal
of
property
and
perhaps
a
title
concerned
but
declared
that
he
was
not
at
liberty
to
say
any
more
thus
the
minds
of
all
were
prepared
for
a
great
revelation
and
it
is
safe
to
say
that
from
one
end
of
sloebury
to
the
other
walter
name
was
in
everybody
mouth
it
had
been
always
believed
that
the
methvens
were
people
of
good
connections
and
of
later
years
it
had
been
whispered
by
the
benevolent
as
a
reason
for
walter
inaction
that
he
had
grand
relations
who
at
the
proper
moment
would
certainly
interfere
and
set
everything
right
for
him
others
however
were
strenuous
in
their
denial
and
ridicule
of
this
asking
was
his
mother
a
woman
to
conceal
any
advantages
she
had
for
they
did
not
understand
the
kind
of
pride
in
which
methven
was
so
strong
and
then
it
was
clear
that
not
only
did
the
grand
relations
do
nothing
for
walter
but
he
did
not
even
have
an
invitation
from
them
and
went
from
home
only
when
his
mother
went
to
the
thus
there
was
great
doubt
and
wonder
and
in
some
quarters
an
inclination
to
treat
the
rumour
as
a
canard
and
to
postpone
belief
at
the
same
time
everybody
believed
it
more
or
less
at
the
bottom
of
their
hearts
feeling
that
a
thing
so
impossible
must
be
true
but
when
it
burst
fully
upon
the
world
next
morning
along
with
the
pale
november
daylight
but
much
more
startling
that
walter
methven
had
succeeded
as
the
next
heir
to
his
distant
cousin
who
was
the
head
of
the
family
and
was
now
lord
erradeen
a
great
potentate
with
castles
in
the
highlands
and
fat
lands
further
south
and
moors
and
deer
forests
and
everything
that
the
heart
of
man
could
think
of
the
town
was
swept
not
only
by
a
thrill
of
wonder
but
of
emotion
nobody
was
indifferent
to
this
extraordinary
romance
some
when
they
had
got
over
the
first
bewilderment
received
it
with
delightful
anticipations
as
if
the
good
fortune
which
had
befallen
walter
was
in
some
respects
good
fortune
also
for
themselves
whereas
many
others
were
almost
angry
at
this
sudden
elevation
over
their
heads
of
one
who
certainly
did
not
deserve
any
better
if
indeed
half
so
well
as
they
did
but
nobody
was
indifferent
it
was
the
greatest
excitement
that
had
visited
sloebury
for
years
even
it
might
be
said
for
generations
lord
erradeen
it
took
away
everybody
breath
among
the
circle
of
walter
more
intimate
acquaintance
the
impression
made
was
still
deeper
as
may
be
supposed
the
commotion
in
the
mind
of
the
rector
who
indeed
was
old
enough
to
have
taken
it
with
more
placidity
was
such
that
he
hurried
in
from
morning
service
without
taking
off
his
cassock
he
was
a
good
churchman
but
not
so
far
gone
as
to
walk
about
the
world
in
that
ecclesiastical
garment
can
you
imagine
what
has
happened
he
said
bursting
in
upon
wynn
who
was
delicate
and
did
not
go
to
church
in
the
winter
mornings
young
walter
methven
that
you
all
made
such
a
talk
about
this
was
unfair
because
she
had
never
made
any
talk
being
a
woman
who
did
not
talk
save
most
sparingly
she
was
tempted
for
a
moment
to
forestall
him
by
telling
him
she
already
knew
but
her
heart
failed
her
and
she
only
shook
her
head
a
little
in
protest
against
this
calumny
and
waited
smilingly
for
what
he
had
to
say
she
could
not
take
away
from
him
the
pleasure
of
telling
this
wonderful
piece
of
news
why
it
was
only
the
night
before
last
he
was
here
most
of
us
rather
disapproving
of
him
poor
boy
said
the
rector
well
lydia
that
young
fellow
that
was
a
you
know
doing
nothing
never
exerting
himself
well
my
dear
the
most
extraordinary
thing
has
happened
the
most
wonderful
piece
of
good
fortune
do
keep
me
on
tenterhooks
julius
i
have
heard
some
buzzing
of
talk
already
i
should
think
you
had
the
town
is
full
of
it
they
tell
me
that
everybody
you
meet
on
the
streets
lydia
said
the
rector
with
solemnity
drawing
close
to
her
to
make
his
announcement
more
imposing
that
boy
is
no
longer
simple
walter
methven
he
is
lord
erradeen
lord
what
cried
the
old
lady
it
was
part
of
her
character
to
be
a
little
deaf
or
rather
hard
of
hearing
which
is
the
prettier
way
of
stating
the
fact
it
was
supposed
by
some
that
this
was
one
of
the
reasons
why
when
any
one
was
blamed
she
always
shook
her
head
lord
but
bless
me
it
is
not
the
name
that
is
so
wonderful
it
is
the
fact
lord
erradeen
a
great
personage
a
man
of
importance
you
do
show
any
surprise
lydia
and
yet
it
is
the
most
astonishing
incident
without
comparison
that
has
happened
in
the
parish
these
hundred
years
i
wonder
what
his
mother
is
thinking
wynn
said
if
her
head
is
turned
nobody
could
be
surprised
of
course
like
every
other
mother
she
thinks
her
son
worthy
of
every
exaltation
i
wish
she
was
of
that
sort
the
old
lady
said
every
woman
is
of
that
sort
said
the
rector
with
hasty
dogmatism
and
in
one
way
i
am
rather
sorry
for
it
will
make
her
feel
she
was
perfectly
right
in
encouraging
him
and
that
would
be
such
a
terrible
example
for
others
the
young
men
will
all
take
to
idling
but
it
is
not
the
idling
but
the
fact
that
there
is
a
peerage
in
the
family
you
ca
expect
cried
the
rector
who
was
not
lucid
that
boys
or
women
either
will
reason
back
so
far
as
that
it
will
be
a
bad
example
and
in
the
mean
time
it
is
a
most
astonishing
fact
but
you
do
seem
in
the
least
excited
i
thought
you
would
have
jumped
out
of
your
chair
out
of
the
body
almost
i
am
too
rheumatic
for
that
said
wynn
with
a
smile
then
i
wonder
if
she
will
come
and
tell
me
the
old
lady
said
i
should
think
she
does
not
know
whether
she
is
on
her
head
or
her
heels
cried
the
rector
i
do
feel
very
sure
myself
and
walter
what
a
change
to
be
sure
for
that
boy
i
hope
he
will
make
a
good
use
of
it
i
hope
he
will
not
dart
off
with
underwood
and
such
fellows
and
make
a
fool
of
himself
mind
i
do
mean
that
i
think
so
badly
of
underwood
he
added
after
a
moment
for
this
was
a
subject
on
which
being
mollified
as
previously
mentioned
the
rector
took
the
male
side
of
the
question
wynn
received
the
protest
in
perfect
silence
not
even
shaking
her
head
but
if
he
took
a
fancy
for
horses
or
that
sort
of
thing
wynn
added
with
a
moment
hesitation
then
he
brightened
up
again
of
course
it
is
better
that
he
should
know
somebody
who
has
a
little
experience
in
any
case
and
you
will
perceive
my
dear
there
is
a
great
difference
between
a
penniless
youth
like
walter
methven
getting
such
notions
in
his
head
which
lead
only
to
ruin
and
young
lord
erradeen
dabbling
a
little
in
amusements
which
after
all
have
no
harm
in
them
if
not
carried
too
far
and
are
natural
in
his
rank
but
you
women
are
always
prejudiced
on
such
a
point
i
did
not
say
anything
my
dear
the
old
lady
said
oh
no
you
do
say
anything
cried
the
rector
fretfully
but
i
see
it
in
every
line
of
your
shawl
and
every
frill
of
your
cap
you
are
just
stiff
with
prejudice
so
far
as
underwood
is
concerned
who
really
is
not
at
all
a
bad
fellow
when
you
come
to
know
him
and
is
always
respectful
to
religion
and
shows
a
right
feeling
but
one
might
as
well
try
to
fly
as
to
convince
you
when
you
have
taken
a
prejudice
wynn
made
no
protest
against
this
she
said
only
it
is
a
great
ordeal
for
a
boy
to
pass
through
i
wonder
if
his
mother
and
here
she
paused
not
having
yet
perhaps
formulated
into
words
the
thoughts
that
arose
in
her
heart
it
is
to
be
hoped
that
she
will
let
him
alone
the
rector
said
she
has
indulged
him
in
everything
hitherto
but
just
now
when
he
is
far
better
left
to
himself
no
doubt
she
will
be
wanting
to
interfere
do
you
think
she
has
indulged
him
in
everything
said
the
old
lady
but
she
did
not
think
it
necessary
to
accuse
her
husband
of
prejudice
perhaps
he
understood
captain
underwood
as
much
better
as
she
understood
methven
so
she
said
nothing
more
she
was
the
only
individual
in
sloebury
who
had
any
notion
of
the
struggle
in
which
walter
mother
had
wrecked
so
much
of
her
own
peace
there
can
not
be
any
two
opinions
on
that
subject
said
the
rector
poor
lad
you
will
excuse
me
my
dear
but
i
am
always
sorry
for
a
boy
left
to
a
woman
training
he
is
either
a
mere
milksop
or
a
walter
is
not
a
milksop
and
here
has
providence
stepped
in
in
the
most
wonderful
way
to
save
him
from
being
the
other
but
that
is
no
virtue
of
hers
you
will
stand
up
of
course
for
your
own
side
the
old
lady
smiled
and
shook
her
head
i
think
every
child
is
the
better
for
having
both
its
parents
julius
if
that
is
what
you
mean
this
was
not
exactly
what
he
meant
but
it
took
the
wind
out
of
the
rector
sails
yes
it
is
an
ordeal
for
him
he
said
but
i
am
sure
if
my
advice
can
do
him
any
good
it
is
at
his
service
and
though
i
have
been
out
of
the
way
of
many
things
for
some
time
yet
i
dare
say
the
world
is
very
much
what
it
was
and
i
used
to
know
it
well
enough
he
will
ask
for
nobody
advice
said
wynn
which
makes
it
all
the
more
desirable
he
should
have
it
cried
the
rector
and
then
he
said
bless
me
i
have
got
my
cassock
on
still
tell
john
to
take
it
down
to
the
vestry
though
by
the
way
there
is
a
button
off
and
you
might
as
well
have
it
put
on
for
me
as
it
is
here
wynn
executed
the
necessary
repair
of
the
cassock
with
her
own
hands
though
she
was
rheumatic
and
did
not
care
to
leave
her
chair
oftener
than
was
necessary
she
had
still
the
use
of
her
hands
and
she
had
a
respect
for
all
the
accessories
of
the
clerical
profession
she
was
sitting
examining
the
garment
to
see
if
any
other
feeblenesses
were
apparent
in
which
a
stitch
in
time
might
save
after
labours
when
with
a
little
eager
tap
at
the
door
another
visitor
came
in
this
was
a
young
lady
of
three
or
four
and
twenty
with
a
good
deal
of
the
beauty
which
consists
in
fresh
complexion
and
pleasant
colour
her
hair
was
light
brown
warm
in
tone
her
eyes
were
brown
and
sparkling
her
cheeks
and
lips
bloomed
with
health
she
had
a
pretty
figure
full
of
life
and
energy
everything
in
short
that
is
necessary
to
make
up
a
pretty
girl
without
any
real
loveliness
or
deeper
grace
she
came
in
quickly
brimming
over
as
was
evident
with
something
which
burst
forth
as
soon
as
she
had
given
the
old
lady
the
hasty
conventional
kiss
of
greeting
and
which
as
a
matter
of
course
turned
out
to
be
the
news
of
which
sloebury
was
full
did
you
ever
hear
anything
so
wonderful
she
said
walter
methven
that
nobody
thought
anything
of
and
now
he
is
turned
into
a
live
lord
a
real
peer
of
parliament
they
say
i
thought
mamma
would
have
fainted
when
she
heard
it
why
should
your
mamma
faint
when
she
heard
of
it
july
it
is
very
pleasant
news
oh
aunt
lydia
do
you
know
why
i
am
so
angry
i
feel
as
if
i
should
never
speak
to
her
again
do
you
remember
and
i
always
thought
you
had
some
hand
in
it
oh
you
sit
there
and
look
so
innocent
but
that
is
because
you
are
so
deep
am
i
deep
the
old
lady
asked
with
a
smile
you
are
the
deepest
person
i
ever
knew
you
see
through
us
all
and
you
just
throw
in
a
word
and
then
when
people
act
upon
it
you
look
so
surprised
i
heard
you
myself
remark
to
mamma
how
often
walter
methven
was
at
our
house
yes
i
think
i
did
remark
it
wynn
said
and
what
was
the
harm
he
liked
to
come
and
he
liked
me
and
i
hope
you
do
think
i
am
the
sort
of
person
to
forget
myself
and
think
too
much
about
a
man
i
thought
you
were
letting
him
be
seen
with
you
too
often
july
that
is
true
you
thought
it
might
keep
others
off
that
were
more
eligible
well
that
is
what
i
supposed
you
meant
for
i
never
like
to
take
a
bad
view
but
you
see
there
was
somebody
that
was
eligible
and
here
has
he
turned
all
at
once
into
the
very
best
match
within
a
hundred
miles
if
mamma
had
only
let
things
alone
what
prospects
might
be
opening
upon
me
now
girls
i
am
afraid
may
say
just
the
same
said
wynn
well
what
does
that
matter
he
had
nothing
else
to
do
when
a
young
man
has
nothing
to
do
he
must
be
making
up
to
somebody
i
do
blame
him
a
bit
that
is
what
makes
us
girls
always
ready
for
a
flirtation
time
hangs
so
heavy
on
our
hands
and
only
think
aunt
lydia
if
things
had
been
allowed
to
go
on
and
i
could
always
have
thrown
him
off
if
anything
better
turned
up
only
think
what
might
have
happened
to
me
now
i
might
be
working
a
coronet
in
all
my
new
handkerchiefs
cried
the
girl
only
imagine
oh
oh
oh
and
she
pretended
to
cry
but
there
was
a
sparkle
of
nervous
energy
all
the
same
in
her
eyes
as
if
she
were
eager
for
the
chase
and
scarcely
able
to
restrain
her
impatience
wynn
shook
her
head
at
her
visitor
with
a
smile
you
are
not
so
worldly
as
you
give
yourself
out
to
be
she
said
oh
that
just
shows
how
little
you
know
i
am
as
worldly
as
ever
woman
was
i
think
of
nothing
but
how
to
establish
myself
and
have
plenty
of
money
we
want
it
so
oh
i
know
you
are
very
good
to
us
both
my
uncle
and
you
but
mamma
is
extravagant
and
i
am
extravagant
and
naturally
all
that
anybody
thinks
of
is
to
have
what
is
necessary
and
decent
for
us
we
have
to
put
up
with
it
but
i
hate
what
is
necessary
and
decent
i
should
like
to
go
in
satin
and
lace
even
if
i
knew
i
should
be
in
rags
and
to
think
if
you
had
not
interfered
that
i
might
have
blazed
in
diamonds
and
gone
to
court
and
done
everything
i
want
to
do
i
could
strangle
you
aunt
lydia
and
mamma
too
upon
which
miss
july
or
julée
which
was
how
her
name
was
pronounced
gave
wynn
a
sudden
kiss
and
took
the
cassock
out
of
her
hands
if
it
wants
any
mending
i
will
do
it
she
said
it
will
just
give
me
a
little
consolation
for
the
moment
and
you
will
have
time
to
think
and
answer
this
question
is
it
too
late
now
july
dear
it
hurts
me
to
hear
you
talk
so
you
are
not
so
wild
as
you
take
credit
for
being
i
am
not
wild
at
all
aunt
lydia
said
the
girl
appropriating
wynn
implements
putting
on
her
thimble
threading
her
needle
and
discovering
at
one
glance
the
little
rent
in
the
cassock
which
the
old
lady
had
been
searching
for
in
vain
except
with
indignation
to
think
what
i
have
lost
if
i
have
lost
it
it
is
all
very
well
to
speak
but
what
is
a
poor
girl
to
do
yes
i
know
to
make
just
enough
to
live
on
by
teaching
or
something
of
that
sort
but
that
is
not
what
i
want
i
want
to
be
well
off
i
am
so
extravagant
and
so
is
mamma
we
keep
ourselves
down
we
do
spend
money
but
we
hate
it
so
i
would
go
through
a
great
many
disagreeables
if
i
could
only
have
enough
to
spend
and
is
walter
one
of
the
disagreeables
you
would
go
through
well
no
i
could
put
up
with
him
very
well
he
is
not
at
all
unpleasant
i
do
want
him
but
i
could
do
with
him
do
you
really
think
it
is
too
late
do
you
think
mamma
might
call
upon
methven
and
say
how
delighted
we
are
and
just
say
to
him
you
know
in
a
playful
way
mamma
could
manage
that
very
well
can
not
hope
to
see
you
now
in
our
little
house
lord
erradeen
and
then
of
course
he
would
be
piqued
for
he
very
generous
and
say
and
mamma
would
say
we
are
such
poor
little
people
and
you
are
now
a
great
man
upon
which
as
sure
as
fate
he
would
be
at
the
cottage
the
same
evening
and
then
july
threw
back
her
head
and
expanded
her
brown
eyes
with
a
conscious
power
and
sense
of
capability
as
who
should
say
then
it
would
be
in
my
own
do
you
think
that
very
good
for
a
plan
she
added
subsiding
quickly
to
the
work
which
she
executed
as
one
to
the
manner
born
i
do
think
anything
of
it
as
a
plan
and
neither
do
you
and
your
mother
would
not
do
it
july
the
old
lady
said
ah
said
july
throwing
back
her
head
there
you
have
hit
the
blot
aunt
lydia
mamma
would
do
it
she
could
you
know
when
she
likes
she
is
the
completest
humbug
but
not
always
and
she
has
so
many
notions
about
propriety
and
what
is
womanly
and
so
forth
just
like
you
poor
women
have
no
business
with
such
luxuries
i
tell
her
we
must
be
of
our
time
and
all
that
sort
of
thing
but
she
wo
see
it
no
i
am
afraid
that
is
just
the
difficulty
it
all
depends
on
mamma
and
mamma
wo
well
it
is
a
little
satisfaction
to
have
had
it
all
out
with
you
if
you
had
not
interfered
you
two
and
stopped
the
poor
boy
coming
at
this
juncture
john
threw
open
the
door
and
with
a
voice
which
he
reserved
for
the
great
county
ladies
announced
mrs
methven
john
had
heard
the
great
news
stopped
the
poor
boy
coming
july
said
the
words
were
but
half
out
of
her
mouth
when
john
opened
the
door
and
it
was
next
to
impossible
that
the
new
visitor
had
not
heard
them
a
burning
blush
covered
the
girl
face
she
sprang
to
her
feet
with
the
cassock
in
her
arms
and
gazed
at
the
new
comer
methven
for
the
first
moment
did
not
notice
this
third
person
she
came
in
with
the
content
and
of
one
who
has
a
great
wonder
to
tell
the
little
world
of
sloebury
and
all
its
incidents
were
as
nothing
to
her
she
went
up
to
old
wynn
with
a
noiseless
swiftness
i
have
come
to
tell
you
great
news
she
said
let
me
look
at
you
said
the
old
lady
i
have
heard
and
i
scarcely
could
believe
it
then
it
is
all
true
i
am
sorry
i
was
not
the
first
to
tell
you
i
think
such
a
thing
must
get
into
the
air
nobody
went
out
from
my
house
last
night
and
yet
everybody
knows
i
saw
even
the
people
in
the
street
looking
at
me
as
i
came
along
wynn
you
always
stood
up
for
him
i
never
said
anything
but
i
know
you
did
i
came
first
to
you
yes
it
is
all
true
the
old
lady
had
known
it
now
for
several
hours
and
had
been
gently
excited
no
more
now
her
eyes
filled
with
tears
she
could
not
have
told
why
dear
boy
i
hope
god
will
bless
him
and
make
him
worthy
and
great
she
said
clasping
her
old
hands
together
he
has
always
been
a
favourite
with
me
he
is
a
favourite
with
everybody
said
july
no
one
had
noticed
her
presence
and
she
was
not
one
that
could
remain
unseen
everybody
is
glad
there
is
not
one
that
does
wish
him
well
did
she
intend
to
strike
that
for
herself
which
her
mother
was
not
to
be
trusted
to
make
wynn
thought
so
with
a
great
tremor
and
interrupted
her
in
a
tone
that
for
her
was
hurried
and
anxious
july
speaks
nothing
but
the
truth
methven
there
is
nobody
that
does
not
like
walter
but
i
suppose
i
ought
now
to
drop
these
familiarities
and
call
him
lord
erradeen
he
will
never
wish
his
old
friends
to
do
that
said
methven
she
already
smiled
with
a
gracious
glance
and
gesture
and
the
feeling
that
these
old
friends
were
almost
too
much
privileged
in
being
so
near
to
him
and
admitted
to
such
signs
of
friendship
came
into
her
mind
but
she
did
not
care
to
have
july
share
her
expansion
miss
herbert
she
said
with
a
little
bow
is
very
good
to
speak
so
kindly
but
everybody
is
kind
i
did
not
know
my
boy
was
so
popular
sunshine
she
added
with
a
smile
brings
out
all
the
flowers
she
had
not
sat
down
and
she
evidently
did
not
mean
to
do
so
while
july
remained
there
was
something
grand
in
her
upright
carriage
in
her
air
of
superiority
which
had
never
been
apparent
before
she
had
always
been
a
woman
as
sloebury
people
said
who
thought
a
great
deal
of
herself
but
no
one
had
ever
acknowledged
her
right
to
do
so
till
now
on
the
other
hand
july
herbert
was
well
used
to
the
cold
shade
her
mother
was
wynn
niece
but
she
was
none
the
less
poor
for
that
and
as
july
was
not
a
girl
to
be
easily
put
down
she
was
acquainted
with
every
manner
of
polite
snubbing
known
in
the
society
of
the
place
this
of
standing
till
she
should
go
was
one
with
which
she
was
perfectly
familiar
and
in
many
cases
it
afforded
her
pleasure
to
subject
the
operator
to
great
personal
inconvenience
but
on
the
present
occasion
she
was
not
disposed
to
exercise
this
power
she
would
have
conciliated
walter
mother
if
she
could
have
done
so
and
on
a
rapid
survey
of
the
situation
she
decided
that
the
best
plan
was
to
yield
i
must
go
and
tell
mamma
the
great
news
she
said
i
am
sure
she
will
never
rest
till
she
rushes
to
you
with
her
congratulations
but
i
will
tell
her
you
are
tired
of
congratulations
already
for
of
course
it
is
not
a
thing
upon
which
there
can
be
two
opinions
july
laid
down
the
cassock
as
she
spoke
i
have
mended
all
there
is
to
mend
aunt
lydia
you
need
not
take
any
more
trouble
about
it
for
the
moment
you
may
be
sure
you
will
see
one
or
other
of
us
before
night
they
watched
her
silently
as
she
went
out
of
the
room
methven
saying
nothing
till
the
door
had
closed
wynn
with
a
deprecatory
smile
upon
her
face
she
did
not
altogether
approve
of
her
grandniece
but
neither
was
she
willing
to
hand
her
over
to
blame
the
old
lady
felt
the
snub
july
had
received
more
than
the
girl
herself
did
she
looked
a
little
wistfully
after
her
she
was
half
angry
when
as
soon
as
july
disappeared
methven
sank
down
upon
a
chair
near
her
huge
billows
of
black
silk
rising
about
her
for
she
had
put
on
her
best
gown
wynn
thought
that
the
mother
whose
child
disapproved
by
the
world
had
been
thus
miraculously
lifted
above
its
censures
should
have
been
all
the
more
tolerant
of
the
other
who
had
met
no
such
glorious
fate
but
she
reflected
that
never
see
which
was
her
favourite
expression
of
wonderment
yet
explanation
of
everything
there
were
so
many
things
that
ought
to
learn
by
but
they
never
saw
it
it
was
thus
she
accounted
with
that
shake
of
her
head
for
all
the
errors
of
mankind
methven
for
her
part
waited
till
even
the
very
step
of
that
objectionable
julia
herbert
had
died
away
she
had
known
by
instinct
that
if
girl
should
appear
she
would
be
on
the
watch
to
make
herself
agreeable
to
walter
mother
as
if
he
could
ever
have
thought
of
her
she
said
to
herself
hours
before
methven
would
have
been
glad
to
think
that
walter
thought
of
any
girl
who
was
at
all
in
his
own
position
she
would
have
hailed
it
as
a
means
of
steadying
him
and
making
him
turn
seriously
to
his
life
but
everything
was
now
changed
and
this
interruption
had
been
very
disagreeable
she
could
scarcely
turn
to
her
old
friend
now
with
the
effusion
and
emotion
which
had
filled
her
when
she
came
in
she
held
out
her
hand
and
grasped
that
of
the
old
lady
i
do
need
to
tell
you
what
i
am
feeling
she
said
it
is
all
like
a
tumultuous
sea
of
wonder
and
thankfulness
i
wanted
it
for
i
was
at
my
wits
end
wynn
was
a
little
chilled
too
but
she
took
the
younger
hand
you
did
not
know
what
was
coming
she
said
you
wanted
one
thing
and
providence
was
preparing
another
i
do
know
if
that
is
how
to
state
it
but
at
all
events
i
was
getting
to
feel
that
i
could
not
bear
it
any
longer
and
trying
for
any
way
of
setting
things
right
when
the
good
came
in
this
superlative
way
i
feel
frightened
when
i
think
of
it
after
we
knew
last
night
i
could
do
nothing
but
cry
it
took
all
the
strength
from
me
you
would
have
thought
it
was
bad
news
i
can
understand
that
the
old
lady
relinquished
the
hand
which
she
had
been
holding
to
be
delivered
from
any
anxieties
you
may
have
had
in
such
a
superlative
way
as
you
say
is
not
the
common
lot
most
of
us
have
just
to
fight
them
out
methven
already
felt
herself
far
floated
away
from
those
that
had
to
fight
it
out
the
very
words
filled
her
heart
with
an
elation
beyond
speech
and
this
morning
she
said
to
wake
and
to
feel
it
must
be
folly
and
then
to
realise
that
it
was
true
one
knows
so
well
the
other
sort
of
waking
when
the
shock
and
the
pang
come
all
over
again
but
to
wake
up
to
this
extraordinary
incredible
one
might
say
happiness
the
tears
of
joy
were
in
her
eyes
and
in
those
tears
there
is
something
so
strange
so
rare
that
the
soul
experienced
in
life
looks
upon
them
almost
with
more
awe
than
upon
the
familiar
ones
of
grief
which
we
see
every
day
the
old
lady
melted
and
her
chill
of
feeling
yielded
to
a
tender
warmth
yet
what
a
pity
that
they
never
see
it
how
much
more
perfect
it
would
have
been
if
the
woman
in
her
happiness
had
been
softened
and
kind
to
all
those
whom
nothing
had
happened
to
imperceptibly
the
old
lady
in
her
tolerant
experience
shook
her
gentle
old
head
then
she
gave
herself
in
full
sympathy
to
hear
all
the
wonderful
details
chapter
the
sentiments
of
the
spectators
in
such
a
grand
alteration
of
fortune
may
be
interesting
enough
and
it
is
in
general
more
easy
to
get
at
them
than
at
those
which
fill
the
mind
of
the
principal
actor
in
the
present
case
it
is
better
to
say
of
the
principal
subject
of
the
change
for
walter
could
not
be
said
to
be
an
actor
at
all
the
emotions
of
the
first
evening
it
would
indeed
be
impossible
to
describe
to
come
in
from
his
small
society
to
whom
even
he
was
so
far
inferior
that
every
one
of
them
had
facilities
of
getting
and
spending
money
which
he
did
not
possess
and
to
sit
down
all
tremulous
and
guilty
feeling
himself
the
poorest
creature
opposite
to
the
serious
and
important
personage
who
came
to
tell
him
with
documents
as
solemn
as
himself
that
this
silly
youth
who
had
been
throwing
away
his
life
for
nothing
without
even
the
swell
of
excitement
to
carry
him
on
had
suddenly
become
without
deserving
it
without
doing
anything
to
bring
it
about
an
individual
of
the
first
importance
a
peer
a
proprietor
a
great
man
walter
could
have
sobbed
as
his
mother
did
had
not
pride
kept
him
back
when
they
sat
down
at
table
in
the
little
there
were
two
at
least
of
the
party
who
ate
nothing
who
sat
and
gazed
at
each
other
across
the
others
with
white
faces
and
blazing
eyes
milnathort
made
a
good
dinner
and
sat
very
watchful
making
also
his
observations
full
of
curiosity
and
a
certain
interest
but
cousin
sophy
was
the
only
one
who
really
got
the
good
of
this
prodigious
event
she
asked
if
they
might
not
have
some
champagne
to
celebrate
the
day
she
was
in
high
excitement
but
quite
and
enjoyed
it
thoroughly
she
immediately
began
in
her
thoughts
to
talk
of
my
young
cousin
lord
erradeen
it
was
a
delightful
advancement
which
would
bring
her
no
advantage
and
yet
almost
pleased
her
more
than
so
much
added
on
to
her
income
for
miss
merivale
was
not
of
any
distinction
in
her
parentage
and
suddenly
to
find
herself
cousin
to
a
lord
went
to
her
heart
it
was
a
great
benefit
to
the
solitary
lady
fond
of
society
and
very
eager
for
a
helping
hand
to
aid
her
up
the
ascent
and
it
was
she
who
kept
the
conversation
going
she
even
flirted
a
little
quite
becomingly
with
the
old
lawyer
who
felt
her
it
was
evident
a
relief
from
the
high
tension
of
the
others
and
was
amused
by
the
vivacious
lady
who
for
the
moment
had
everything
her
own
way
after
dinner
there
was
a
great
deal
of
explanation
given
and
a
great
many
facts
made
clear
but
it
is
to
be
doubted
whether
walter
knew
very
well
what
was
being
said
he
listened
with
an
air
of
attention
but
it
was
as
if
he
were
listening
to
some
fairy
tale
something
out
of
the
was
being
repeated
before
him
he
was
informed
how
the
different
branches
of
his
family
had
died
out
one
after
another
captain
methven
was
aware
that
he
was
in
the
succession
the
lawyer
said
and
methven
cast
a
thought
back
upon
her
husband
who
had
been
dead
so
long
that
his
words
and
ways
were
like
shadows
to
her
which
she
could
but
faintly
recall
would
it
have
been
better
if
he
had
told
her
after
pursuing
this
thought
a
long
time
she
decided
that
it
would
not
that
he
had
done
wisely
yet
felt
a
little
visionary
grudge
and
disappointment
to
think
that
he
had
been
able
to
keep
such
a
secret
from
her
no
doubt
it
was
all
for
the
best
she
might
have
distracted
herself
with
hopes
and
worn
out
her
mind
with
waiting
it
was
doubtful
if
the
support
of
knowing
what
was
going
to
happen
would
really
have
done
her
any
good
but
yet
it
seemed
a
want
of
trust
in
her
it
seemed
even
to
put
her
in
a
partially
ridiculous
position
now
as
knowing
nothing
not
having
even
an
idea
of
what
was
coming
but
walter
did
not
share
any
of
these
goings
back
upon
the
past
he
had
scarcely
known
his
father
nor
was
he
old
enough
to
have
had
such
a
secret
confided
to
him
for
long
after
captain
methven
died
he
thought
nothing
of
that
he
sat
with
an
appearance
of
the
deepest
attention
but
unaware
of
what
was
being
said
with
a
vague
elation
in
his
mind
something
that
seemed
to
buoy
him
up
above
the
material
earth
he
could
not
bring
himself
down
again
it
was
what
he
remembered
to
have
felt
when
he
was
a
child
when
some
pleasure
was
coming
even
in
that
case
hindrances
might
come
in
it
might
rain
or
some
similar
calamity
might
occur
but
rain
could
not
affect
this
he
sat
and
listened
and
did
not
hear
a
word
next
morning
walter
awoke
very
early
before
the
wintry
day
had
fully
dawned
he
opened
his
eyes
upon
a
sort
of
paling
and
whitening
of
everything
a
grey
perception
of
the
walls
about
him
and
the
lines
of
the
window
marked
upon
the
paleness
outside
what
was
it
that
made
even
these
depressing
facts
exhilarate
him
and
rouse
an
incipient
delight
in
his
mind
which
for
the
moment
he
did
not
understand
then
he
sat
up
suddenly
in
his
bed
it
was
cold
it
was
dark
there
was
no
assiduous
servant
to
bring
hot
water
or
light
his
fire
everything
was
chilling
and
wretched
and
he
was
not
given
to
early
rising
ordinarily
it
was
an
affair
of
some
trouble
to
get
him
roused
to
see
that
he
was
in
time
for
a
train
or
for
any
early
occupation
but
this
morning
he
found
it
impossible
to
lie
still
an
elasticity
in
him
an
elation
and
buoyancy
which
he
almost
felt
with
a
laugh
might
float
him
up
to
the
ceiling
like
the
mediums
made
him
jump
up
as
it
were
in
it
buoyed
him
it
carried
him
as
on
floating
pinions
into
a
limitless
heaven
what
was
it
who
was
he
the
chill
of
the
morning
brought
him
a
little
to
himself
and
then
he
sat
down
in
his
and
delivered
himself
up
to
the
incredible
and
laughed
low
and
long
with
a
sense
of
the
impossibility
of
it
that
brought
tears
to
his
eyes
he
lord
erradeen
lord
anything
he
a
peer
a
great
man
he
with
lands
and
money
and
wealth
of
every
sort
who
last
night
had
been
pleased
to
win
two
sixpences
after
the
buoyancy
and
sensation
of
rising
beyond
the
world
altogether
which
was
a
kind
of
physical
consciousness
of
something
great
that
had
happened
before
he
was
awake
came
this
sense
of
the
ludicrous
this
incredulity
and
confused
amusement
he
dressed
himself
in
this
mood
laughing
low
from
time
to
time
to
himself
as
if
it
were
some
game
which
was
being
played
upon
him
but
of
which
he
was
in
the
secret
and
not
to
be
deceived
however
artfully
it
might
be
managed
but
when
he
was
dressed
and
ready
to
go
by
which
time
daylight
had
fully
struggled
forth
upon
a
wet
and
clammy
world
he
stopped
himself
short
with
a
sudden
reminder
that
this
curious
practical
joke
was
to
extend
its
career
and
become
known
to
the
world
he
laughed
again
but
then
he
grew
grave
standing
staring
at
the
closed
door
of
his
bedroom
out
of
which
he
was
about
to
issue
no
longer
a
nobody
in
a
new
character
to
meet
the
remarks
the
congratulations
of
his
friends
he
knew
that
the
news
would
fly
through
the
little
town
like
lightning
that
people
would
stop
each
other
in
the
streets
and
ask
have
you
heard
it
is
it
true
and
that
throughout
the
whole
place
there
would
be
a
sort
of
revolution
a
general
change
of
positions
which
would
confuse
the
very
world
he
knew
vaguely
that
whatever
else
might
happen
he
would
be
uppermost
the
people
who
had
disapproved
of
him
and
treated
him
haut
en
would
find
this
to
be
impossible
any
longer
he
would
be
in
a
position
which
is
to
be
seen
on
the
stage
and
in
books
more
frequently
than
in
common
life
possessed
of
the
power
of
making
retribution
of
punishing
the
wicked
and
distributing
to
the
good
tokens
of
his
favour
it
is
a
thing
we
would
all
like
to
do
to
avenge
ourselves
within
due
christian
and
social
limits
on
the
persons
who
have
despised
us
and
to
reward
those
who
have
believed
in
us
showing
the
one
how
right
they
were
and
the
other
how
wrong
they
were
with
a
logic
that
should
be
undeniable
there
is
nobody
who
has
ever
endured
a
snub
and
who
has
not
who
would
not
delight
in
doing
this
but
the
most
of
us
never
get
such
a
supreme
gratification
and
walter
was
to
have
it
he
was
going
to
see
everybody
abashed
and
confounded
who
had
ever
treated
him
with
contumely
once
more
he
felt
that
sensation
of
buoyancy
and
elation
as
if
he
were
spurning
earth
with
his
foot
and
ready
to
soar
into
some
sort
of
celestial
sphere
and
then
once
more
he
laughed
to
himself
was
it
possible
could
it
be
would
anybody
believe
it
he
thought
there
would
be
an
explosion
of
incredulous
laughter
through
all
the
streets
but
then
when
that
was
over
both
friends
and
foes
would
be
forced
to
believe
it
as
he
himself
was
forced
to
believe
with
that
he
opened
his
door
and
went
into
the
new
world
he
stumbled
over
the
housemaid
pail
of
course
but
did
not
call
forth
any
frown
upon
that
functionary
freckled
forehead
as
he
would
have
done
yesterday
on
the
contrary
she
took
away
the
pail
and
begged
his
pardon
with
awe
being
of
course
entirely
blameless
he
paused
for
a
moment
on
the
steps
as
he
faced
the
raw
morning
air
going
out
and
lo
the
early
baker
who
was
having
a
word
with
cook
at
the
area
over
the
rolls
turned
towards
him
with
a
reverential
look
and
pulled
off
his
cap
these
were
the
first
visible
signs
of
walter
greatness
they
gave
him
a
curious
sort
of
conviction
that
after
all
the
thing
was
true
there
was
scarcely
anybody
about
the
sloebury
streets
except
bakers
and
milkmen
at
this
hour
it
was
a
leisurely
little
town
in
which
nothing
particular
was
doing
no
manufactures
or
business
to
demand
early
hours
and
the
good
people
did
not
get
up
early
why
should
they
the
day
was
long
enough
without
that
so
that
walter
met
no
one
in
his
early
promenade
but
before
he
got
back
there
were
symptoms
that
the
particular
baker
who
had
taken
off
his
cap
had
whispered
the
news
to
others
of
his
fraternity
who
having
no
tie
of
human
connection
such
as
supplying
the
family
with
rolls
to
justify
a
salutation
only
stared
at
him
with
looks
as
he
went
past
he
felt
he
was
an
object
of
interest
even
to
the
policeman
going
off
duty
who
being
an
old
soldier
saluted
with
a
certain
grandeur
as
he
tramped
by
the
young
man
took
an
aimless
stroll
through
the
district
the
roads
were
wet
the
air
raw
it
was
not
a
cheerful
morning
damp
and
discouragement
breathed
in
the
air
the
little
streets
looked
squalid
and
featureless
in
shabby
british
poverty
lines
of
low
brick
all
commonplace
and
monotonous
it
was
the
sort
of
morning
to
make
you
think
of
the
tediousness
to
which
most
people
get
up
every
day
supposing
it
to
be
life
and
accepting
it
as
such
with
the
dull
content
which
knows
no
better
a
life
made
up
of
scrubbing
out
of
kitchens
and
sweeping
out
of
parlours
of
taking
down
shutters
and
putting
them
up
again
all
sordid
petty
unbroken
by
an
exhilarating
event
but
this
was
not
what
struck
walter
as
he
floated
along
in
his
own
wonderful
atmosphere
seeing
nothing
noting
everything
with
the
strange
vision
of
excitement
afterwards
he
recollected
with
extraordinary
vividness
a
man
who
stood
stretching
his
arms
in
shirt
sleeves
above
his
head
for
a
long
yawn
and
remembered
to
have
looked
up
at
the
within
which
he
was
standing
and
read
the
name
of
robinson
in
gilt
letters
robinson
yawning
in
his
against
a
background
of
groceries
pallid
in
the
early
light
remained
with
him
like
a
picture
for
many
a
day
when
he
got
back
the
breakfast
table
was
spread
and
his
mother
taking
her
place
at
it
milnathort
had
not
gone
away
as
he
intended
by
the
night
train
he
had
remained
in
methven
spare
room
surrounded
by
all
the
attentions
and
civilities
that
a
household
of
women
regarding
him
with
a
sort
of
awe
as
a
miraculous
messenger
or
even
creator
of
good
fortune
could
show
to
a
bachelor
gentleman
somewhat
prim
and
in
his
habits
and
ways
it
was
his
intention
to
leave
sloebury
by
the
eleven
train
and
he
had
arranged
that
walter
should
meet
him
in
edinburgh
within
a
week
to
be
made
acquainted
with
several
family
matters
in
which
as
the
head
of
the
house
it
was
necessary
that
he
should
be
fully
instructed
neither
walter
nor
his
mother
paid
very
much
attention
to
these
arrangements
nor
even
remarked
that
the
old
lawyer
spoke
of
them
with
great
gravity
methven
was
busy
making
tea
and
full
of
anxiety
that
milnathort
should
breakfast
well
and
largely
after
what
she
had
always
understood
to
be
the
fashion
of
his
country
and
as
for
walter
he
was
not
in
a
state
of
mind
to
observe
particularly
any
such
indications
of
manner
cousin
sophia
was
the
only
one
who
remarked
the
solemnity
of
his
tone
and
aspect
one
would
suppose
there
was
some
ordeal
to
go
through
she
said
in
her
vivacious
way
a
young
gentleman
who
is
taking
up
a
large
fortune
and
a
great
responsibility
will
have
many
ordeals
to
go
through
madam
milnathort
said
in
his
deliberate
tones
but
he
did
not
smile
or
take
any
other
notice
of
her
archness
it
was
settled
accordingly
that
after
a
few
days
for
preparation
and
young
lord
erradeen
should
leave
sloebury
and
if
i
might
advise
alone
milnathort
said
the
place
is
perhaps
not
just
in
a
condition
to
receive
ladies
i
would
think
it
wiser
on
the
whole
madam
if
you
deferred
your
coming
till
his
lordship
there
has
settled
everything
for
your
reception
coming
said
methven
the
last
twelve
hours
had
made
an
extraordinary
difference
in
her
feelings
and
faith
but
still
she
had
not
forgotten
what
had
gone
before
nor
the
controversies
and
struggles
of
the
past
we
must
leave
all
that
for
after
consideration
she
said
walter
was
about
to
speak
impulsively
but
old
milnathort
stopped
him
with
a
skilful
interruption
it
will
perhaps
be
the
wisest
way
he
said
there
will
be
many
things
to
arrange
when
lord
erradeen
has
visited
the
property
and
understands
everything
about
it
then
he
will
be
able
to
walter
heard
the
name
at
first
with
easy
unconsciousness
then
it
suddenly
blazed
forth
upon
him
as
his
own
name
his
mother
at
the
other
end
of
the
table
felt
the
thrill
of
the
same
sensation
their
eyes
met
and
all
the
wonder
of
this
strange
new
life
suddenly
gleamed
upon
them
with
double
force
it
is
true
that
the
whole
condition
of
their
minds
was
affected
by
this
revelation
that
there
was
nothing
about
them
that
was
not
full
of
it
and
that
they
were
actually
at
this
moment
discussing
the
business
connected
with
it
still
it
all
came
to
life
now
as
at
the
first
moment
at
the
sound
of
this
name
lord
erradeen
walter
could
not
help
laughing
to
himself
over
his
coffee
i
ca
tell
who
you
mean
he
said
you
must
wait
a
little
until
i
realise
what
walter
methven
has
got
to
do
with
it
methven
thought
that
this
was
making
too
much
of
the
change
she
already
wished
to
believe
or
at
least
to
persuade
milnathort
to
believe
that
she
was
not
so
very
much
surprised
after
all
lord
erradeen
she
said
is
too
much
amused
at
present
with
having
got
a
new
name
to
take
the
change
very
seriously
he
will
soon
learn
the
difference
madam
said
milnathort
property
is
a
thing
that
has
always
to
be
taken
seriously
and
of
all
property
the
erradeen
lands
there
are
many
things
connected
with
them
that
he
will
have
to
set
his
face
to
in
a
way
that
will
be
far
from
amusing
the
old
lawyer
had
a
very
grave
countenance
perhaps
it
was
because
he
was
a
scotchman
he
worked
through
his
breakfast
with
a
steady
routine
that
filled
the
ladies
with
respect
first
fish
then
kidneys
then
a
leg
of
the
partridge
that
had
been
left
from
dinner
last
night
finally
he
looked
about
the
table
with
an
evident
sense
of
something
wanting
and
though
he
declared
that
it
was
of
no
consequence
avowed
at
last
with
some
shyness
that
it
was
the
marmalade
for
which
he
was
looking
and
there
was
none
in
the
house
milnathort
was
full
of
excuses
for
having
made
such
a
suggestion
it
was
just
a
scotch
fashion
he
declared
it
was
of
no
consequence
methven
who
held
an
unconscious
conviction
that
it
was
somehow
owing
to
him
that
walter
had
become
lord
erradeen
was
made
quite
unhappy
by
the
omission
i
shall
know
better
another
time
she
said
regretfully
they
were
all
still
under
the
impression
more
or
less
that
it
was
his
doing
he
was
not
a
mere
agent
to
them
but
the
god
out
of
the
machinery
who
had
turned
darkness
into
light
he
justified
this
opinion
still
more
fully
before
he
went
away
putting
into
walter
hand
a
from
a
london
bank
into
which
a
sum
of
money
which
seemed
to
the
inexperienced
young
man
inexhaustible
had
been
paid
to
his
credit
the
old
gentleman
on
his
side
seemed
after
a
while
by
the
attention
shown
him
he
resisted
when
walter
declared
his
intention
of
going
to
the
railway
to
see
him
off
that
is
just
a
reversal
of
our
positions
he
said
at
this
methven
became
a
little
anxious
fearing
that
perhaps
walter
simplicity
might
be
going
too
far
she
gave
him
a
word
of
warning
when
the
cab
drove
up
for
milnathort
bag
it
was
not
a
very
large
one
and
walter
was
quite
equal
to
the
condescension
of
carrying
it
to
the
station
if
his
mother
had
not
taken
that
precaution
she
could
not
make
up
her
mind
that
he
was
able
to
manage
for
himself
you
must
remember
that
after
all
he
is
only
your
man
of
business
she
said
notwithstanding
all
the
worship
she
had
herself
been
paying
to
this
emissary
of
fortune
it
was
a
relief
to
shake
hands
with
him
to
see
him
drive
away
from
the
door
leaving
behind
him
such
an
amazing
such
an
incalculable
change
somehow
it
was
more
easy
to
realise
it
when
he
was
no
longer
there
and
this
was
what
walter
felt
when
he
walked
away
from
the
railway
having
seen
with
great
satisfaction
the
grizzled
head
of
the
old
scotsman
nod
at
him
from
a
window
of
the
departing
train
the
messenger
was
gone
the
thing
which
he
had
brought
with
him
did
that
remain
was
it
conceivable
that
it
was
now
fixed
and
certain
not
to
be
affected
by
anything
that
could
be
done
or
said
walter
walked
steadily
enough
along
the
pavement
but
he
did
not
think
he
was
doing
so
the
world
around
him
swam
in
his
eyes
once
more
he
could
not
make
sure
that
he
was
walking
on
solid
ground
or
mounting
up
into
the
air
how
different
it
was
from
the
way
in
which
he
had
come
forth
yesterday
idle
angry
with
himself
and
everybody
yet
knowing
very
well
what
to
do
turning
with
habitual
feet
into
the
way
where
all
the
other
idlers
congregated
knowing
who
he
should
meet
and
what
would
happen
he
was
separated
from
all
that
as
if
by
an
ocean
he
had
no
longer
anything
to
do
with
these
foolish
loungers
his
mother
had
told
him
a
thousand
times
in
often
varied
tones
that
they
were
not
companions
for
him
he
recognised
the
fact
with
a
certain
disgust
he
felt
it
more
strongly
still
when
he
suddenly
came
across
captain
underwood
coming
up
eagerly
with
outstretched
hands
i
hope
i
am
the
first
to
congratulate
you
lord
erradeen
he
said
now
you
will
know
why
i
asked
you
yesterday
was
there
any
news
now
i
shall
know
i
do
a
bit
what
do
you
mean
do
you
mean
me
to
believe
that
had
any
hand
in
it
walter
cried
with
a
tone
of
mingled
incredulity
and
disdain
no
hand
in
it
unless
i
had
helped
to
put
the
last
poor
dear
lord
out
of
the
way
i
could
scarcely
have
had
that
but
if
you
mean
did
i
know
about
it
i
certainly
did
as
you
must
if
you
had
been
a
little
more
in
the
world
why
did
you
tell
me
then
said
walter
he
added
somewhat
hotly
with
something
of
the
sublime
assumption
of
youth
waiting
for
a
man
to
die
would
never
have
suited
me
i
much
prefer
to
have
been
as
you
say
out
of
the
world
oh
lord
i
did
mean
to
offend
you
said
the
captain
do
get
on
a
high
horse
of
course
if
you
known
your
debrett
as
i
do
you
would
have
seen
the
thing
plain
enough
however
we
need
quarrel
about
it
i
have
always
said
you
were
my
pupil
and
i
hope
i
have
put
you
up
to
a
few
things
that
will
be
of
use
on
your
entry
into
society
have
you
said
walter
he
could
not
think
how
he
had
ever
for
a
moment
put
up
with
this
person
underwood
stood
before
him
with
a
sort
of
jaunty
rendering
of
the
appeal
with
which
grooms
and
people
about
the
stable
remind
a
young
man
of
what
in
his
boyish
days
they
have
done
for
him
an
appeal
which
has
its
natural
issue
in
a
sovereign
but
he
could
not
give
underwood
a
sovereign
and
it
was
perhaps
just
a
little
ungenerous
to
turn
in
the
first
moment
of
his
prosperity
from
a
man
who
from
whatever
purpose
had
been
serviceable
to
him
in
his
poverty
he
said
with
an
attempt
to
be
more
friendly
i
know
underwood
you
have
been
very
kind
oh
by
jove
kind
is
the
word
i
knew
you
want
a
bit
of
training
the
best
thoroughbred
that
ever
stepped
wants
that
and
if
i
can
be
of
any
use
to
you
in
the
future
i
will
i
knew
old
erradeen
i
known
all
about
the
family
for
generations
there
are
a
great
many
curious
things
about
it
but
i
think
i
can
help
you
through
them
said
the
captain
with
a
mixture
of
anxiety
and
swagger
there
had
always
been
something
of
this
same
mixture
about
him
but
walter
had
never
been
fully
conscious
what
it
was
till
now
thank
you
he
said
perhaps
it
will
be
better
to
let
that
develop
itself
in
a
natural
way
i
am
going
to
scotland
in
a
week
and
then
i
shall
have
it
at
first
hand
then
i
can
tell
you
beforehand
you
will
find
a
great
many
things
you
wo
like
said
underwood
abruptly
it
is
not
for
nothing
that
a
family
gets
up
such
a
reputation
i
know
two
or
three
of
your
places
mulmorrel
and
the
on
loch
etive
and
that
mysterious
old
place
at
i
have
been
at
every
one
of
them
it
was
not
everybody
i
can
tell
you
that
old
erradeen
would
have
taken
to
that
place
why
there
is
a
mystery
at
every
corner
there
is
walter
held
up
his
hand
to
stay
this
torrent
he
coloured
high
with
a
curious
sentiment
of
proprietorship
and
the
shrinking
of
pride
from
hearing
that
which
was
his
discussed
by
strangers
he
scarcely
knew
the
names
of
them
and
their
histories
not
at
all
he
put
up
his
hand
i
would
rather
find
out
the
mysteries
for
myself
he
said
oh
cried
underwood
if
you
are
standing
on
your
dignity
my
lord
as
you
like
for
that
matter
i
am
not
one
to
thrust
my
company
upon
any
man
if
he
does
like
it
i
have
stood
your
friend
and
i
would
again
but
as
for
forcing
myself
upon
you
now
that
you
come
to
your
kingdom
underwood
cried
the
other
touched
in
the
tenderest
point
if
you
dare
to
insinuate
that
this
has
changed
me
i
desire
never
to
speak
to
you
again
but
it
is
only
i
suppose
one
of
the
figures
of
speech
that
people
use
when
they
are
angry
i
am
not
such
a
cad
as
you
make
me
out
whether
my
name
is
methven
or
erradeen
i
do
seem
to
know
very
well
which
it
is
it
is
both
the
other
cried
with
a
great
laugh
and
they
shook
hands
engaging
to
dine
together
at
the
hotel
that
evening
underwood
who
was
knowing
in
such
matters
was
to
order
the
dinner
and
two
or
three
of
the
old
set
were
to
be
invited
it
would
be
a
farewell
to
his
former
comrades
as
walter
intended
and
with
a
curious
recurrence
of
his
first
elation
he
charged
his
representative
to
spare
no
expense
there
was
something
intoxicating
and
strange
in
the
very
phrase
as
he
left
underwood
and
proceeded
along
the
high
street
where
if
he
had
not
waved
his
hand
to
them
in
passing
with
an
air
of
haste
and
at
least
every
second
person
he
met
would
have
stopped
him
to
wish
him
joy
he
suddenly
encountered
july
herbert
she
was
going
home
from
the
vicarage
out
of
which
his
mother
had
politely
driven
her
and
it
seemed
the
most
wonderful
luck
to
july
to
get
him
to
herself
thus
wholly
unprotected
and
with
nobody
even
to
see
what
she
was
after
she
went
up
to
him
not
with
underwood
eagerness
but
with
a
pretty
frank
pleasure
in
her
face
i
have
heard
a
fairy
tale
she
said
and
it
is
true
i
suppose
you
mean
about
me
said
walter
yes
i
am
afraid
it
is
true
i
do
exactly
know
who
i
am
at
present
afraid
cried
july
ah
you
know
you
do
mean
that
at
all
events
you
are
no
longer
just
the
old
walter
whom
we
have
known
all
our
lives
there
was
another
girl
with
her
whom
walter
knew
but
slightly
but
who
justified
the
plural
pronoun
on
the
contrary
i
was
going
to
say
when
you
interrupted
me
i
am
so
sorry
i
interrupted
you
that
though
i
did
not
know
who
i
was
in
the
face
of
the
world
i
was
always
the
old
walter
a
man
i
believe
can
never
lose
his
christian
name
nor
a
woman
either
said
july
that
is
the
only
thing
that
can
not
be
taken
from
us
we
are
supposed
you
know
rather
to
like
the
loss
of
the
other
one
i
have
heard
so
said
walter
who
was
not
unaccustomed
to
this
sort
of
fencing
but
i
suppose
it
is
not
true
oh
said
july
if
it
were
for
the
same
reason
that
makes
you
change
your
name
i
should
not
mind
but
there
is
no
peerage
in
our
family
that
i
know
of
and
i
should
not
have
any
chance
if
there
were
alas
lord
erradeen
it
is
a
lovely
name
and
may
i
always
speak
to
you
when
i
meet
you
though
you
are
such
a
grand
personage
we
do
not
hope
to
see
you
at
the
cottage
now
but
mamma
will
like
to
know
that
you
still
recognise
an
old
friend
i
shall
come
and
ask
herbert
what
she
thinks
of
it
all
walter
said
july
brown
eyes
flashed
out
with
triumph
as
she
laughed
and
waved
her
hand
to
him
she
said
it
will
be
too
great
an
honour
and
curtseyed
then
laughed
again
as
she
went
on
casting
a
glance
at
him
over
her
shoulder
he
laughed
too
he
was
young
and
he
was
gratified
even
by
this
undisguised
provocation
though
he
could
not
help
saying
to
himself
with
a
slight
beat
of
his
heart
how
near
he
was
to
falling
in
love
with
that
girl
what
a
good
thing
it
was
that
he
did
not
as
for
july
she
looked
at
him
with
a
certain
ferocity
as
if
she
would
have
devoured
him
to
think
of
all
that
boy
had
it
in
his
power
to
give
if
he
pleased
and
to
think
how
little
a
poor
girl
could
do
chapter
vi
methven
was
conscious
of
a
new
revival
of
the
old
displeasure
when
walter
informed
her
of
the
engagement
he
had
formed
for
the
evening
she
was
utterly
disappointed
she
had
thought
that
the
great
and
beneficial
shock
of
this
new
life
would
turn
his
character
altogether
and
convert
him
into
that
domestic
sovereign
that
object
of
constant
reference
criticism
and
devotion
which
every
woman
would
have
every
man
be
it
was
a
wonderful
mortification
and
enlightenment
to
find
that
without
even
the
interval
of
a
single
evening
devoted
to
the
consideration
of
his
new
and
marvellous
prospects
and
that
talking
over
which
is
one
of
the
sweetest
parts
of
a
great
and
happy
event
he
should
return
to
what
to
wallowing
in
the
mire
as
the
scripture
says
to
his
old
acquaintances
the
idlers
and
undesirable
persons
with
whom
he
had
formed
associations
could
there
be
anything
more
unsuitable
than
lord
erradeen
in
the
midst
of
such
a
party
with
underwood
and
perhaps
worse
than
underwood
it
wounded
her
pride
and
roused
her
temper
and
in
spite
of
all
her
efforts
it
was
with
a
lowering
brow
that
she
saw
him
go
away
afterwards
indeed
when
she
thought
of
it
as
she
did
for
hours
together
while
cousin
sophia
talked
and
she
languidly
replied
maintaining
a
conversation
from
the
lips
outward
so
poor
a
substitute
for
the
evening
talking
over
and
happy
consultation
she
had
dreamed
of
methven
was
more
just
to
her
son
she
tried
always
to
be
just
poor
lady
she
placed
before
herself
all
the
reasons
for
his
conduct
that
he
should
entertain
the
men
who
much
against
her
wish
and
his
own
good
yet
in
their
way
had
been
kind
to
and
entertained
him
was
natural
but
to
do
it
this
first
evening
was
hard
and
she
could
not
easily
accept
her
disappointment
afterwards
she
reminded
herself
with
a
certain
stern
philosophy
that
because
walter
had
owned
a
touch
of
natural
emotion
and
had
drawn
near
to
her
and
confessed
himself
in
the
wrong
that
was
no
reason
why
his
character
should
be
changed
in
a
moment
there
were
numbers
of
men
who
on
occasion
felt
and
lamented
their
misdoing
yet
went
on
again
in
the
same
way
he
had
been
no
doubt
startled
as
some
are
by
calamity
by
the
more
extraordinary
shock
of
this
good
fortune
but
why
should
he
for
that
abandon
all
the
tastes
and
occupations
of
his
former
life
it
was
she
she
said
to
herself
with
some
bitterness
who
was
a
fool
the
fact
was
that
walter
meant
no
harm
at
all
and
that
it
was
merely
the
first
impulse
of
a
liberality
impatience
of
the
old
associations
which
he
had
tacitly
acknowledged
were
not
fit
for
him
that
led
him
back
to
his
former
companions
he
felt
afterwards
that
it
would
have
been
in
better
taste
had
he
postponed
this
for
a
night
but
he
was
very
impatient
and
eager
to
shake
himself
free
of
them
and
enter
upon
his
new
career
something
of
the
same
disappointed
and
disapproving
sentiment
filled
methven
mind
when
she
heard
of
his
visit
to
the
cottage
she
knew
no
reason
why
he
should
take
a
special
leave
of
july
herbert
if
he
knew
himself
a
reason
which
he
did
not
disclose
that
was
another
matter
thoughts
like
this
embittered
the
preparations
for
his
departure
which
otherwise
would
have
been
so
agreeable
she
had
to
see
after
many
things
which
a
young
man
of
more
wealth
or
more
independent
habits
would
have
done
for
himself
his
linen
his
portmanteau
most
of
the
things
he
wanted
except
the
tailor
part
of
the
business
but
it
was
not
until
the
last
evening
that
there
was
any
of
the
confidential
consultation
for
which
her
heart
had
longed
even
on
that
last
day
walter
had
been
very
little
indoors
he
had
been
busy
with
a
hundred
trifles
and
she
had
begun
to
make
up
her
mind
to
his
going
away
without
a
word
said
as
to
their
future
relations
as
to
whether
he
meant
his
mother
to
share
any
of
the
advantages
of
his
new
position
or
to
drop
her
at
sloebury
as
something
done
with
which
he
did
not
care
to
burden
himself
with
any
more
than
the
other
circumstances
of
his
past
career
she
did
so
little
justice
to
the
real
generosity
of
her
son
temper
in
the
closeness
of
her
contest
with
him
and
the
heat
of
personal
feeling
that
she
had
begun
to
make
up
her
mind
to
this
with
what
pain
and
bitterness
it
is
unnecessary
to
say
she
had
even
began
to
make
excuses
for
her
own
desertion
in
the
tumult
of
endless
thought
upon
this
one
subject
which
possessed
her
she
would
be
just
after
all
was
it
not
better
perhaps
that
she
should
be
left
in
the
little
house
which
was
her
independent
home
for
which
she
owed
nothing
to
any
one
if
any
unnecessary
sense
of
gratitude
made
him
offer
her
reluctantly
a
share
in
his
new
life
that
would
be
humiliation
indeed
if
as
was
apparent
her
society
her
advice
her
love
were
nothing
to
him
was
it
not
far
better
that
both
should
recognise
the
situation
and
view
things
in
their
true
light
this
the
proud
woman
had
made
up
her
mind
to
with
what
depth
of
wounded
tenderness
and
embittered
affection
who
could
say
she
had
packed
for
him
with
her
own
hands
for
all
his
permanent
arrangements
were
to
be
made
after
he
had
left
sloebury
and
to
change
her
household
in
consequence
of
an
alteration
of
fortune
which
according
to
all
appearances
would
not
concern
her
was
she
had
proudly
decided
quite
out
of
the
question
she
packed
for
him
as
in
the
days
when
he
was
going
to
school
when
he
was
a
boy
and
liked
everything
better
that
had
been
done
by
his
mother
a
woman
may
be
pardoned
for
feeling
such
a
difference
with
a
passionate
soreness
and
sense
of
downfall
in
those
days
how
she
had
thought
of
the
time
when
he
would
be
grown
up
when
he
would
understand
all
her
difficulties
and
share
all
her
cares
and
in
his
own
advancement
make
her
triumphant
and
happy
god
forgive
me
she
said
to
herself
now
he
has
got
advancement
far
above
my
hopes
and
i
am
making
myself
wretched
thinking
of
myself
she
stopped
and
cried
a
little
over
his
new
linen
no
he
was
right
if
it
must
be
allowed
that
they
did
not
get
on
it
was
indeed
far
better
in
the
long
run
that
there
should
be
no
false
sentiment
no
keeping
up
of
an
untenable
position
thank
god
she
required
nothing
she
had
enough
she
wanted
neither
luxury
nor
grandeur
and
her
home
her
natural
place
was
here
where
she
had
lived
so
many
years
where
she
could
disarm
all
comment
upon
walter
neglect
of
her
by
saying
that
she
preferred
the
place
where
she
had
lived
so
long
and
where
she
had
so
many
friends
why
indeed
should
she
change
her
home
at
her
time
of
life
no
doubt
he
would
come
back
some
time
and
see
her
but
after
all
why
should
her
life
be
unsettled
because
his
was
changed
it
was
he
who
showed
true
sense
in
his
way
of
judging
the
matter
she
said
to
herself
with
a
smile
through
the
hastily
dried
and
momentary
tears
walter
came
in
when
the
packing
was
just
about
concluded
he
came
half
way
up
the
stairs
and
called
mother
where
are
you
as
he
had
often
done
when
he
was
a
boy
and
wanted
her
at
every
turn
but
as
he
never
did
now
this
touched
and
weakened
her
again
in
her
steady
resolution
to
let
him
see
no
repining
in
her
are
you
packing
for
me
he
called
out
again
what
a
shame
while
i
have
been
idling
but
come
down
mother
please
and
leave
that
you
forget
we
have
everything
to
settle
yet
what
is
there
to
settle
she
said
with
a
certain
sharpness
of
tone
which
she
could
not
quite
suppress
coming
out
upon
the
landing
the
maids
who
were
going
to
bed
and
who
heard
all
this
thought
it
was
beautiful
to
hear
his
lordship
speaking
like
that
quite
natural
to
his
mother
but
that
missus
was
that
hard
it
was
no
wonder
if
they
get
on
and
cousin
sophia
from
her
virgin
retirement
where
she
sat
in
her
reading
a
french
novel
and
very
much
alive
to
every
sound
commented
in
her
own
mind
closing
her
book
in
the
same
sense
now
she
will
just
go
and
hold
him
at
arm
length
while
the
boy
heart
is
melting
and
then
break
her
own
miss
merivale
said
to
herself
thus
everybody
was
against
her
and
in
favour
of
the
fortunate
young
fellow
who
had
been
supping
on
homage
and
flattery
and
now
came
in
easy
and
careless
to
make
everything
straight
at
the
last
moment
methven
on
her
side
was
very
tired
and
tremulous
with
the
exertion
of
packing
it
would
have
been
impossible
for
her
to
banish
that
tone
out
of
her
voice
she
stood
in
the
subdued
light
upon
the
stairs
looking
down
upon
him
leaning
on
the
banister
to
support
herself
while
he
with
all
the
light
from
below
upon
his
face
ruddy
with
the
night
air
and
the
applauses
and
his
own
high
looked
up
gaily
at
her
he
had
shaken
off
all
his
old
irritability
in
the
confidence
of
happiness
and
good
fortune
that
had
taken
possession
of
him
after
a
moment
he
came
springing
up
the
stairs
three
at
a
time
you
look
tired
mother
while
i
have
been
wasting
my
time
come
down
and
let
us
have
our
talk
i
do
all
the
rest
he
said
throwing
his
arm
round
her
and
leading
her
he
brought
her
some
wine
first
of
all
and
a
footstool
and
threw
himself
into
the
easy
task
of
making
her
comfortable
now
he
said
let
talk
it
all
over
drawing
a
chair
to
her
side
all
this
was
quite
new
upon
walter
part
or
rather
quite
old
belonging
to
an
age
which
had
long
ago
gone
is
it
rather
late
for
that
she
said
with
a
faint
smile
yes
and
i
am
ashamed
of
myself
but
unfortunately
you
are
so
used
to
that
we
must
settle
however
mother
i
am
to
go
first
of
all
to
which
milnathort
says
is
not
a
place
for
you
indeed
i
hear
here
he
paused
a
little
as
if
he
would
have
named
his
authority
and
continued
that
it
is
a
ruinous
sort
of
place
and
why
i
should
go
there
i
do
know
where
did
you
hear
she
said
with
quick
suspicion
well
mother
i
would
rather
not
have
mentioned
his
name
but
if
you
wish
to
know
from
underwood
i
know
you
are
prejudiced
against
him
yes
it
is
prejudice
though
i
do
wonder
at
it
i
care
nothing
for
the
fellow
but
still
it
comes
out
which
is
rather
strange
that
he
knows
these
places
and
a
good
deal
about
the
erradeens
is
that
then
cried
the
mother
quickly
the
reason
of
his
being
here
he
never
said
so
nor
have
i
asked
him
answered
walter
with
something
of
his
old
sullenness
but
then
he
added
the
same
thought
has
crossed
my
own
mind
mother
and
i
should
wonder
if
it
were
so
walter
she
said
a
man
like
that
can
have
but
one
motive
the
desire
to
aggrandise
himself
for
heaven
sake
do
have
anything
to
do
with
him
do
let
him
get
an
influence
over
you
you
must
have
a
very
poor
opinion
of
me
mother
he
said
in
an
aggrieved
tone
she
looked
at
him
with
a
curious
gaze
silenced
as
it
seemed
she
loved
him
more
than
anything
in
the
world
and
thought
of
him
above
everything
and
yet
perhaps
in
that
wrath
with
those
we
love
which
works
like
madness
in
the
brain
it
was
true
what
he
said
that
she
had
a
poor
opinion
of
him
extremes
meet
as
the
proverb
says
however
this
was
a
mystery
too
deep
for
walter
to
enter
into
do
let
us
waste
words
about
underwood
he
said
i
care
nothing
for
the
fellow
he
is
vulgar
and
presuming
as
you
always
said
partly
no
doubt
this
avowal
was
made
with
the
intention
of
pleasing
his
mother
at
the
same
time
it
proved
the
great
moral
effect
of
promotion
in
rank
lord
erradeen
saw
with
the
utmost
distinctness
what
walter
methven
had
only
glimpsed
by
intervals
and
it
is
impossible
to
describe
how
this
speech
pleased
methven
her
tired
eyes
began
to
shine
her
heart
to
return
to
its
brighter
hopes
the
thing
is
what
arrangements
you
wish
me
to
make
said
walter
what
are
you
going
to
do
i
hear
mulmorrel
is
a
handsome
house
but
it
november
and
naturally
it
is
colder
in
the
north
do
you
think
you
would
care
to
go
there
now
or
wait
till
the
weather
is
better
it
may
want
furnishing
for
anything
i
know
and
it
appears
we
got
a
little
house
in
town
walter
she
said
in
a
voice
which
was
husky
and
tremulous
before
you
enter
upon
all
this
you
must
first
think
my
dear
are
you
sure
it
will
be
for
your
comfort
to
have
me
with
you
at
all
would
you
rather
be
free
and
make
your
own
arrangements
and
leave
me
as
i
am
mother
the
young
man
cried
he
got
up
suddenly
from
where
he
was
sitting
beside
her
and
pushed
away
his
chair
and
stood
facing
her
with
a
sudden
paleness
and
fiery
eyes
that
seemed
to
dazzle
her
he
had
almost
kicked
her
footstool
out
of
his
way
in
his
excitement
and
wounded
feeling
do
you
mean
to
say
you
want
to
have
nothing
to
do
with
me
he
said
oh
my
boy
you
could
not
think
so
i
thought
that
was
what
you
meant
i
wish
only
what
is
for
your
good
would
it
be
for
my
good
to
be
an
unnatural
cad
said
the
young
man
with
rising
indignation
a
heartless
whelp
with
no
sense
and
no
feeling
oh
mother
mother
what
a
poor
opinion
you
must
have
of
me
he
cried
and
so
stung
was
he
with
this
blow
that
sudden
tears
sprang
to
his
eyes
all
because
i
a
fool
and
put
everything
off
to
the
last
moment
he
added
in
a
sort
of
undertone
as
if
explaining
it
to
himself
but
i
not
a
beast
for
all
that
he
said
fiercely
she
made
him
no
reply
but
sat
and
gazed
at
him
with
a
remorse
and
compunction
which
painful
sentiments
as
they
are
were
to
her
sweet
as
the
dews
from
heaven
yes
it
appeared
that
through
all
her
passionate
and
absorbing
tenderness
she
had
had
a
poor
opinion
of
him
she
had
done
him
injustice
the
conviction
was
like
a
new
birth
that
he
should
be
lord
erradeen
was
nothing
in
comparison
of
being
as
he
thus
proved
himself
good
and
true
open
to
the
influences
of
affection
and
nature
she
could
not
speak
but
her
eyes
were
full
of
a
thousand
things
they
asked
him
mutely
to
forgive
her
they
repented
and
were
abashed
and
rejoiced
all
in
one
glance
the
young
man
who
had
not
been
nearly
so
heartless
as
she
feared
was
now
not
nearly
so
noble
as
she
thought
but
he
was
greatly
touched
by
the
crisis
and
by
the
suggestion
of
many
a
miserable
hour
which
was
in
her
involuntary
sin
against
him
and
in
her
penitence
he
came
back
again
and
sat
close
by
her
and
kissed
her
tremulously
i
have
been
a
cad
he
said
i
do
wonder
you
lost
all
faith
in
me
mother
not
that
not
that
she
said
faintly
and
then
there
was
a
moment
of
exquisite
silence
in
which
without
a
word
everything
was
atoned
for
and
pardon
asked
and
given
and
then
began
perhaps
the
happiest
hour
of
methven
life
in
which
they
talked
over
everything
and
decided
what
was
to
be
done
not
to
give
up
the
house
in
sloebury
at
present
nor
indeed
to
do
anything
at
present
save
wait
till
he
had
made
his
expedition
into
scotland
and
seen
his
new
property
and
brought
her
full
particulars
after
he
had
investigated
everything
and
knew
exactly
the
capabilities
of
the
house
and
the
condition
in
which
it
was
and
all
the
necessities
and
expediencies
they
would
then
decide
as
to
the
best
thing
to
be
done
whether
to
go
there
though
at
the
worst
time
of
the
year
or
to
go
to
london
which
was
an
idea
that
pleased
walter
but
alarmed
his
mother
methven
did
her
best
to
remember
what
were
the
duties
of
a
great
landed
proprietor
and
to
bring
them
home
to
her
son
you
ought
to
spend
christmas
at
your
own
place
she
said
there
will
be
charities
and
hospitalities
and
the
poor
people
to
look
after
she
did
not
know
scotland
nor
did
she
know
very
well
what
it
was
to
be
a
great
country
magnate
she
had
been
but
a
poor
officer
daughter
herself
and
had
married
another
officer
and
been
beaten
about
from
place
to
place
before
she
settled
down
on
her
small
income
at
sloebury
she
had
not
much
more
experience
than
walter
himself
had
in
this
respect
indeed
if
the
truth
must
be
told
both
of
them
drew
their
chief
information
from
novels
those
sources
of
information
in
which
the
life
of
rural
potentates
is
a
favourite
subject
and
not
always
described
with
much
knowledge
walter
gravely
consented
to
all
this
with
a
conscientious
desire
to
do
what
was
right
but
he
thought
the
place
would
most
likely
be
gloomy
for
his
mother
in
winter
and
that
hospitalities
would
naturally
be
uncalled
for
so
soon
after
the
death
of
the
old
lord
what
i
would
advise
would
be
park
lane
he
said
with
a
judicial
tone
milnathort
said
that
it
was
quite
a
small
house
what
is
a
small
house
in
park
lane
would
look
a
palace
at
sloebury
methven
said
and
you
must
not
begin
on
an
extravagant
footing
my
dear
you
will
let
us
begin
comfortably
i
hope
he
said
and
i
must
look
for
a
nice
carriage
for
you
mother
walter
felt
disposed
to
laugh
as
he
said
the
words
but
carried
them
off
with
an
air
of
easy
indifference
as
if
it
were
the
most
natural
thing
in
the
world
while
his
mother
on
her
side
could
have
cried
for
pleasure
and
tenderness
you
must
not
mind
me
walter
we
must
think
what
is
best
for
yourself
she
said
as
proud
and
pleased
as
if
she
had
twenty
carriages
nothing
of
the
sort
he
said
we
are
going
to
be
comfortable
and
you
must
have
everything
that
is
right
first
of
all
what
an
hour
it
was
now
and
then
there
will
be
given
to
one
individual
out
of
a
class
a
full
measure
of
recompense
heaped
and
overflowing
out
of
which
the
rest
may
get
a
sympathetic
pleasure
though
they
do
not
enjoy
it
in
their
own
persons
methven
had
never
imagined
that
this
would
come
to
her
but
lo
in
a
moment
it
was
pouring
upon
her
in
floods
of
consolation
so
absorbing
was
this
happy
consultation
that
it
was
only
when
her
eyes
suddenly
caught
the
clock
on
the
mantelpiece
and
saw
that
the
hands
were
marking
a
quarter
to
two
that
methven
startled
awoke
out
of
her
bliss
my
poor
boy
that
i
should
keep
you
up
to
this
hour
talking
and
a
long
journey
before
you
she
cried
she
hustled
him
up
to
his
room
after
this
talking
and
resisting
gaily
to
the
very
door
he
was
happy
too
with
that
sense
of
happiness
conferred
which
is
always
sweet
and
especially
to
youth
in
the
delightful
easy
sense
of
power
and
beneficence
when
he
thought
of
it
he
was
a
little
remorseful
to
think
that
he
had
possessed
the
power
so
long
and
never
exercised
it
for
walter
was
generous
enough
to
be
aware
that
the
house
in
park
lane
and
the
carriage
were
not
the
occasions
of
his
mother
blessedness
poor
mother
he
said
to
himself
softly
he
might
have
made
her
a
great
deal
more
happy
if
he
had
chosen
before
these
fine
things
were
dreamt
of
but
methven
remembered
that
no
more
she
begged
pardon
of
god
on
her
knees
for
misjudging
her
boy
and
for
once
in
her
life
was
profoundly
undoubtingly
happy
with
a
perfection
and
fulness
of
content
which
perhaps
could
only
come
after
long
experience
of
the
reverse
after
such
a
moment
a
human
creature
if
possible
should
die
so
as
to
taste
nothing
less
sweet
for
the
less
sweet
to
be
sure
must
come
back
if
life
goes
on
and
at
that
moment
there
was
not
a
cloud
or
a
suggestion
of
darkness
upon
the
firmament
she
grudged
falling
asleep
though
she
was
very
tired
and
so
losing
this
beautiful
hour
but
nature
is
wilful
and
will
seldom
abdicate
the
night
for
joy
whatever
she
may
do
for
grief
next
morning
she
went
to
the
station
with
him
to
see
him
away
impossible
to
describe
the
devotion
of
all
the
officials
to
lord
erradeen
comfort
on
his
journey
the
kindly
came
to
superintend
this
august
departure
and
the
porters
ran
about
contending
for
his
luggage
with
an
excitement
which
made
at
least
one
old
gentleman
threaten
to
write
to
the
there
was
nothing
but
my
lord
and
his
lordship
to
be
heard
all
over
the
station
and
so
many
persons
came
to
bid
him
and
see
the
last
of
him
as
they
said
that
the
platform
was
quite
inconveniently
crowded
among
these
of
course
was
captain
underwood
whose
fervent
god
bless
you
my
boy
drowned
all
other
greetings
he
had
however
a
disappointed
look
as
if
he
had
failed
in
some
object
methven
whose
faculties
were
all
sharpened
by
her
position
and
who
felt
herself
able
to
exercise
a
toleration
which
in
former
circumstances
would
have
been
impossible
to
her
permitted
him
to
overtake
her
as
she
left
the
place
and
acknowledged
his
greeting
with
more
cordiality
or
at
least
with
a
less
forbidding
civility
than
usual
and
then
a
wonderful
sight
was
seen
in
sloebury
this
of
the
feminine
world
this
man
whom
every
lady
frowned
upon
was
seen
walking
along
the
high
street
side
by
side
in
earnest
conversation
with
one
of
the
women
who
had
been
most
unfavourable
to
him
was
she
listening
to
an
explanation
a
justification
an
account
of
himself
such
as
he
had
not
yet
given
to
satisfy
the
requirements
of
the
respectability
of
sloebury
to
tell
the
truth
methven
now
cared
very
little
for
any
such
explanation
she
did
not
remember
as
she
ought
to
have
done
that
other
women
sons
might
be
in
danger
from
this
suspicious
person
though
her
own
was
now
delivered
out
of
his
power
but
she
was
very
curious
to
know
what
anybody
could
tell
her
of
walter
new
possessions
and
of
the
family
which
it
was
rather
humiliating
to
know
so
little
about
it
was
she
indeed
who
had
begun
the
conversation
after
his
first
remark
upon
walter
departure
and
the
loss
which
would
result
to
sloebury
you
know
something
about
the
erradeens
my
son
tells
me
she
said
almost
graciously
something
i
know
about
as
much
as
most
people
i
knew
he
was
the
heir
which
few
except
yourselves
did
the
captain
said
he
cast
a
keen
glance
at
her
when
he
said
except
yourselves
indeed
said
methven
that
is
scarcely
correct
for
walter
did
not
know
and
i
had
forgotten
i
had
indeed
lost
sight
of
my
family
and
the
succession
seemed
so
far
off
it
was
thus
that
she
veiled
her
ignorance
and
endeavoured
to
make
it
appear
that
indifference
on
her
part
and
a
wise
desire
to
keep
mind
unaffected
by
such
a
dazzling
possibility
had
been
her
guiding
influence
she
spoke
with
such
modest
gravity
that
captain
underwood
not
used
to
delusion
under
that
form
was
tempted
into
a
sort
of
belief
he
looked
at
her
curiously
but
her
veil
was
down
and
her
artifice
if
it
was
an
artifice
was
of
a
kind
more
delicate
than
any
to
which
he
was
accustomed
well
he
said
then
it
was
not
such
a
surprise
to
you
as
people
thought
sloebury
has
talked
of
nothing
else
i
need
not
tell
you
for
several
days
and
everybody
was
of
opinion
that
it
burst
upon
you
like
a
thunderbolt
upon
my
son
yes
methven
said
with
a
smile
he
looked
at
her
again
and
she
had
the
satisfaction
of
perceiving
that
this
experienced
man
of
the
world
was
taken
in
well
then
he
said
you
will
join
with
me
in
wishing
him
well
out
of
it
you
know
all
the
stories
that
are
about
i
have
never
been
at
mulmorrel
my
husband
chances
in
his
own
lifetime
were
very
small
you
know
it
is
mulmorrel
it
is
that
little
ruined
place
where
something
uncanny
is
always
said
to
go
on
oh
do
know
what
it
is
nobody
does
but
the
reigning
sovereign
himself
and
some
i
suppose
i
have
been
there
i
seen
the
mysterious
light
you
know
nobody
can
ever
tell
what
window
it
shows
at
or
if
it
is
any
window
at
all
i
was
once
with
the
late
man
the
late
lord
he
who
died
the
other
day
when
it
came
out
suddenly
we
were
shooting
wildfowl
and
his
gun
fell
out
of
his
hands
i
never
saw
a
man
in
such
a
funk
we
were
a
bit
late
and
twilight
had
come
on
before
we
knew
so
then
you
actually
saw
something
of
it
yourself
methven
said
she
had
not
the
remotest
idea
what
this
was
but
if
she
could
find
out
something
by
any
means
she
was
eager
enough
to
take
advantage
of
it
no
more
than
that
but
i
can
tell
you
this
erradeen
was
not
seen
again
for
hours
whether
it
was
a
call
to
him
or
what
it
was
i
ca
undertake
to
say
he
never
would
stand
any
questioning
about
it
he
was
a
good
fellow
enough
but
he
never
would
put
up
with
anything
on
that
point
so
i
can
only
wish
walter
well
through
it
methven
in
my
opinion
he
should
have
had
some
one
with
him
for
he
is
young
and
i
dare
say
he
is
fanciful
my
son
lord
erradeen
said
methven
with
dignity
is
man
enough
i
hope
to
meet
an
emergency
perhaps
you
think
him
younger
than
he
is
she
propounded
this
delicately
as
perhaps
a
sort
of
excuse
for
the
presumption
of
the
christian
name
underwood
grew
very
red
he
was
disappointed
and
irritable
oh
of
course
you
know
best
he
said
as
for
my
lord
erradeen
i
am
sure
i
beg
your
pardon
for
forgetting
his
dignity
i
dare
say
he
is
quite
old
enough
to
take
care
of
himself
at
least
we
hope
so
but
a
business
of
that
kind
will
upset
the
steadiest
brain
you
know
old
erradeen
had
not
a
bad
spirit
of
his
own
and
funked
it
i
confess
i
feel
a
little
anxious
for
your
boy
he
a
nice
fellow
but
he
nervous
i
was
in
a
dozen
minds
to
go
up
with
him
to
stand
by
him
but
perhaps
it
is
better
not
for
the
best
motives
get
misconstrued
in
this
world
i
can
only
wish
him
well
out
of
it
captain
underwood
said
taking
off
his
hat
and
making
her
a
fine
bow
as
he
stalked
away
it
is
needless
to
say
that
this
mysterious
intimation
of
danger
planted
daggers
in
methven
heart
she
stopped
aghast
and
for
the
moment
the
idea
of
running
back
to
the
station
and
signalling
that
the
train
was
to
be
stopped
came
into
her
mind
ridiculous
folly
wish
him
well
out
of
it
what
out
of
his
great
fortune
his
peerage
his
elevation
in
the
world
methven
smiled
indignantly
and
thought
of
the
strange
manifestations
under
which
envy
shows
itself
but
she
went
home
somewhat
pale
and
could
not
dismiss
it
from
her
mind
as
she
wished
to
do
well
out
of
it
and
there
were
moments
when
she
remembered
she
had
surprised
a
very
serious
look
on
the
countenance
of
milnathort
was
walter
going
unwarned
in
the
elation
and
happy
confidence
of
his
heart
into
some
danger
unknown
and
unforeseen
this
took
her
confidence
away
from
her
and
made
her
nervous
and
anxious
but
after
all
what
folly
it
must
be
something
uncanny
and
a
mysterious
light
these
were
stories
for
christmas
to
bring
a
laugh
or
a
shiver
from
idle
circles
round
the
fire
to
imagine
that
they
could
effect
anything
in
real
life
was
a
kind
of
madness
an
exploded
superstition
it
was
too
ridiculous
to
be
worthy
a
thought
chapter
vii
walter
arrived
in
edinburgh
on
a
wintry
morning
white
and
chill
a
sort
of
woolly
shroud
wrapped
all
the
fine
features
of
the
landscape
he
thought
the
dingy
turrets
of
the
calton
jail
were
the
castle
and
was
much
disappointed
as
was
natural
arthur
seat
and
the
crags
were
as
entirely
invisible
as
if
they
had
been
a
hundred
miles
away
and
the
cold
crept
into
his
very
bones
after
his
night
journey
although
it
had
been
made
luxuriously
in
a
way
very
different
from
his
former
journeyings
also
it
struck
him
as
strange
and
uncomfortable
that
nobody
was
aware
of
the
change
in
his
position
and
that
even
the
railway
porter
to
whom
he
gave
a
shilling
as
a
commoner
he
would
have
been
contented
with
sixpence
only
called
him
sir
and
could
not
perceive
that
it
would
have
been
appropriate
to
say
my
lord
he
went
to
an
hotel
as
it
was
so
early
and
found
only
a
dingy
little
room
to
repose
himself
in
the
more
important
part
of
the
house
being
still
in
the
hands
of
the
housemaids
and
when
he
gave
his
name
as
lord
erradeen
the
attendants
stared
at
him
with
a
sort
of
suspicion
they
looked
at
his
baggage
curiously
and
evidently
asked
each
other
if
it
was
possible
he
could
be
what
he
claimed
to
be
walter
had
a
of
being
an
impostor
and
trying
to
take
these
surprised
people
in
he
thawed
however
as
he
ate
his
breakfast
and
the
mist
began
to
rise
revealing
the
outline
of
the
old
town
he
had
never
been
in
edinburgh
before
he
had
rarely
been
anywhere
before
it
was
all
new
to
him
even
the
sense
of
living
in
an
inn
there
was
a
curious
freedom
about
it
and
independence
of
all
restraint
which
pleased
him
but
it
was
very
strange
to
be
absolutely
unknown
to
meet
the
gaze
of
faces
he
had
never
seen
before
and
to
be
obliged
always
to
explain
who
he
was
it
was
clear
that
a
servant
was
a
thing
quite
necessary
to
a
man
who
called
himself
by
a
title
a
servant
not
so
much
to
attend
upon
him
as
to
answer
for
him
and
be
a
sort
of
guarantee
to
the
world
now
that
he
was
here
in
edinburgh
he
was
not
quite
sure
what
to
do
with
himself
it
was
too
early
to
do
anything
he
could
not
disturb
old
milnathort
at
such
an
hour
he
must
let
the
old
man
get
to
his
office
and
read
his
letters
before
he
could
descend
upon
him
so
that
on
the
whole
walter
though
sustained
by
the
excitement
of
his
new
position
was
altogether
chilled
and
not
at
all
comfortable
feeling
those
early
hours
of
grim
daylight
hang
very
heavily
on
his
hands
he
went
out
after
he
had
refreshed
and
dressed
and
strolled
about
the
fine
but
foreign
street
it
looked
quite
foreign
to
his
inexperienced
eyes
the
castle
soared
vaguely
through
the
grey
mist
the
irregular
line
of
roofs
and
spires
crowning
the
ridge
threw
itself
up
vaguely
against
a
darker
grey
behind
there
was
a
river
of
mist
between
him
and
that
ridge
running
deep
in
the
hollow
underneath
the
nearer
bank
which
was
tufted
with
spectral
bushes
and
trees
and
with
still
more
spectral
white
statues
glimmering
through
on
the
other
side
of
the
street
more
cheerful
and
apparent
were
the
jewellers
shops
full
of
glistening
pebbles
and
national
ornaments
everybody
knows
that
it
is
not
these
shops
alone
but
others
of
every
luxurious
kind
that
form
the
glory
of
prince
street
but
walter
was
a
stranger
and
foreigner
and
in
the
morning
mists
the
shining
store
of
cairngorms
was
the
most
cheerful
sight
that
met
his
eye
milnathort
office
was
in
a
handsome
square
with
a
garden
in
the
centre
of
it
and
another
statue
holding
possession
of
the
garden
for
the
first
time
since
he
left
home
walter
felt
a
little
thrill
of
his
new
importance
when
he
beheld
the
respectful
curiosity
produced
among
the
clerks
by
the
statement
of
his
name
they
asked
his
lordship
to
step
in
with
an
evident
sensation
and
for
walter
himself
to
look
into
that
office
where
his
mother
had
so
strongly
desired
that
he
should
find
a
place
had
the
most
curious
effect
he
felt
for
the
moment
as
if
he
were
one
of
the
serious
young
men
peeping
from
beyond
the
wooden
railing
that
inclosed
the
office
at
the
fortunate
youth
whose
circumstances
were
no
different
from
their
own
he
did
not
realise
at
that
moment
the
unfailing
human
complacency
which
would
have
come
to
his
aid
in
such
circumstances
and
persuaded
him
that
the
gifts
of
fortune
had
nothing
to
do
with
real
superiority
he
thought
of
the
possible
reflections
upon
himself
of
the
other
young
fellows
in
their
lowly
estate
as
if
he
had
himself
been
making
them
he
was
sorry
for
them
all
for
the
contrast
they
must
draw
and
the
strange
sense
of
human
inequality
that
they
must
feel
he
was
no
better
than
they
were
who
could
tell
perhaps
not
half
as
good
he
felt
that
to
feel
this
was
a
due
tribute
from
lord
erradeen
in
his
good
fortune
to
those
who
might
have
been
walter
but
who
had
never
had
any
chance
of
being
lord
erradeen
and
then
he
thought
what
a
good
thing
it
was
that
he
had
never
written
that
letter
to
milnathort
offering
himself
for
a
desk
in
the
office
he
had
felt
really
guilty
on
the
subject
at
the
time
he
had
felt
that
it
was
miserable
of
him
to
neglect
the
occasion
thus
put
before
him
of
gaining
a
livelihood
real
and
unmistakable
had
been
in
his
mind
and
yet
what
a
good
thing
he
had
not
done
it
and
how
little
one
knows
what
is
going
to
happen
these
were
very
ordinary
reflections
not
showing
much
depth
but
it
must
be
recollected
that
walter
was
still
in
a
sort
of
primary
state
of
feeling
and
had
not
had
time
to
reach
a
profounder
level
milnathort
made
haste
to
receive
him
coming
out
of
his
own
room
on
purpose
and
giving
him
the
warmest
welcome
i
might
have
thought
you
would
come
by
the
night
train
you
are
not
old
enough
to
dislike
night
travelling
as
i
do
but
i
will
take
it
ill
and
so
will
my
sister
if
you
stay
in
an
hotel
and
your
room
ready
for
you
in
our
little
place
i
think
you
will
be
more
comfortable
with
us
though
we
have
no
grandeur
to
surround
you
with
my
sister
has
a
great
wish
to
make
your
acquaintance
my
lord
erradeen
she
has
just
a
wonderful
acquaintance
with
the
family
and
it
was
more
through
her
than
any
one
that
i
knew
just
where
to
put
my
hand
upon
you
when
the
time
came
i
did
not
like
to
disturb
you
so
early
walter
said
well
perhaps
there
is
something
in
that
we
are
not
very
early
birds
and
as
a
matter
of
fact
alison
did
not
expect
you
till
about
seven
at
night
and
here
am
i
in
the
midst
of
my
day
work
but
tell
you
what
i
do
for
you
we
go
round
to
the
club
and
there
your
young
lordship
will
make
acquaintance
with
somebody
that
can
show
you
something
of
edinburgh
you
have
never
been
here
before
it
is
a
great
pity
that
there
is
an
easterly
haar
which
is
bad
both
for
you
and
the
objects
you
are
wanting
to
see
however
it
is
lifting
and
get
some
luncheon
and
then
i
will
put
you
in
the
way
that
is
the
best
thing
i
can
do
for
you
malcolm
you
will
send
down
all
the
documents
relative
to
his
lordship
affairs
to
moray
place
this
afternoon
and
you
can
tell
old
symington
to
be
in
attendance
in
case
lord
erradeen
should
wish
to
see
him
that
is
your
cousin
the
late
lord
body
servant
he
is
a
man
of
great
experience
and
you
might
wish
but
all
that
can
be
settled
later
on
if
drysdales
should
send
over
about
that
case
of
theirs
ye
will
say
malcolm
that
i
shall
be
here
not
later
than
three
in
the
afternoon
and
if
old
blairallan
comes
fyking
ye
can
say
i
am
giving
the
case
my
best
attention
and
if
it
that
big
fellow
about
his
manse
and
his
augmentation
i
fear
that
i
am
unpardonable
said
walter
in
interfering
with
your
valuable
time
nothing
of
the
sort
it
is
not
every
day
that
a
lord
erradeen
comes
into
his
inheritance
and
as
there
are
may
be
things
not
to
tell
you
at
night
we
may
as
well
make
the
best
of
it
in
the
morning
said
the
old
lawyer
he
got
himself
into
his
coat
as
he
spoke
slowly
not
without
an
effort
the
sun
was
struggling
through
the
mist
as
they
went
out
again
into
the
streets
and
the
gun
from
the
castle
helped
for
a
moment
to
disperse
the
haar
and
show
the
noble
cliff
on
which
it
rears
its
head
aloft
milnathort
paused
to
look
with
tender
pride
along
the
line
the
houses
and
spires
lifting
out
of
the
clouds
the
sunshine
breaking
through
the
crown
of
hovering
like
a
visible
sign
of
rank
over
the
head
of
the
throned
city
awakened
in
him
that
keen
pleasure
and
elation
in
the
beauty
of
his
native
place
which
is
nowhere
more
warmly
felt
than
in
edinburgh
he
waved
his
hand
towards
the
old
town
in
triumph
you
may
have
seen
a
great
deal
but
ye
will
never
have
seen
anything
finer
than
that
he
said
i
have
seen
very
little
said
walter
but
everybody
has
heard
of
edinburgh
so
that
it
does
not
take
one
by
surprise
ay
that
is
very
wisely
said
if
it
took
you
by
surprise
and
you
had
never
heard
of
it
before
the
world
would
just
go
daft
over
it
however
it
is
a
drawback
of
a
great
reputation
that
ye
never
come
near
it
with
your
mind
clear
having
said
this
the
old
gentleman
dismissed
the
subject
with
a
wave
of
his
hand
and
said
in
a
different
tone
you
will
be
very
curious
about
the
family
secrets
you
are
coming
into
lord
erradeen
walter
laughed
i
am
coming
to
them
with
my
mind
clear
he
said
i
know
nothing
about
them
but
i
do
believe
much
in
family
secrets
they
belong
to
the
middle
ages
nowadays
we
have
nothing
to
conceal
milnathort
listened
to
this
blasphemy
with
a
countenance
in
which
displeasure
struggled
with
that
supreme
sense
that
the
rash
young
man
would
soon
know
better
which
disarms
reproof
he
shook
his
head
you
may
say
we
can
conceal
but
little
he
said
which
is
true
enough
but
not
altogether
true
either
courage
is
a
fine
thing
lord
erradeen
and
i
am
always
glad
to
see
it
and
if
you
have
your
imagination
under
control
that
will
do
ye
still
better
service
in
most
cases
it
is
not
only
what
we
see
but
what
we
think
we
are
going
to
see
that
daunts
us
keep
you
your
head
cool
that
is
your
best
defence
in
all
emergencies
it
is
better
to
be
too
bold
than
not
to
be
bold
enough
notwithstanding
the
poet
warning
to
yon
of
his
these
last
words
made
walter
stare
for
he
was
not
very
learned
in
poetry
at
the
best
and
was
totally
unprepared
to
hear
spenser
from
the
lips
of
the
old
scottish
lawyer
he
was
silent
for
a
little
in
mere
perplexity
and
then
he
said
with
a
laugh
you
speak
of
danger
as
if
we
were
on
the
eve
of
a
battle
are
there
giants
to
encounter
or
magicians
one
would
think
we
were
living
in
the
dark
ages
walter
cried
with
a
little
impatience
milnathort
said
nothing
more
he
led
the
young
man
into
one
of
the
great
stone
palaces
which
form
the
line
of
prince
street
and
which
was
then
the
seat
of
the
old
original
club
of
edinburgh
society
here
walter
found
himself
in
the
midst
of
a
collection
of
men
with
marked
and
individual
faces
each
one
of
whom
ought
to
be
somebody
he
thought
many
of
them
were
bound
about
the
throat
with
white
ties
like
clergymen
but
they
did
not
belong
to
that
profession
it
gave
the
young
man
a
sense
of
his
own
importance
which
generally
deserted
him
in
milnathort
presence
and
of
which
he
felt
himself
to
stand
in
need
to
perceive
that
he
excited
a
great
deal
of
interest
among
these
grave
and
potent
signors
there
was
a
certain
desire
visible
to
make
his
acquaintance
and
to
ascertain
his
political
opinions
of
which
walter
was
scarcely
aware
as
yet
whether
he
had
any
it
was
suggested
at
once
that
he
should
be
put
up
for
the
club
and
invitations
to
dinner
began
to
be
showered
upon
him
he
was
stopped
short
in
his
replies
to
those
cordial
beginnings
of
acquaintance
by
milnathort
who
calmly
assumed
the
guidance
of
his
movements
lord
erradeen
he
said
is
on
his
way
west
business
will
not
permit
him
to
tarry
at
this
moment
we
hope
he
will
be
back
ere
long
and
perhaps
stay
a
while
in
edinburgh
and
see
what
is
to
be
seen
in
the
way
of
society
this
summary
way
of
taking
all
control
of
his
own
movements
from
him
astounded
walter
so
much
that
he
merely
stared
at
his
old
tyrant
or
vizier
and
in
his
confusion
of
surprise
and
anger
did
not
feel
capable
of
saying
anything
which
after
all
was
the
most
dignified
way
for
he
said
to
himself
it
was
not
necessary
to
yield
implicit
obedience
even
if
he
refrained
from
open
protest
upon
these
encroachments
on
his
liberty
in
the
mean
time
it
was
evident
that
the
old
lawyer
did
not
intend
him
to
have
any
liberty
at
all
he
produced
out
of
the
recesses
of
the
club
library
a
beaming
little
man
in
spectacles
to
whom
he
committed
the
charge
of
the
young
stranger
bannatyne
he
said
knows
edinburgh
as
well
as
i
know
my
chambers
and
he
will
just
take
you
round
what
is
most
worth
seeing
when
walter
attempted
to
escape
with
a
civil
regret
to
give
his
new
acquaintance
trouble
he
was
put
down
by
both
with
eagerness
the
old
town
is
just
the
breath
of
my
nostrils
said
the
little
antiquary
it
can
not
be
said
that
it
a
fragrant
breath
said
old
milnathort
but
since
that
is
so
lord
erradeen
you
would
not
deprive
our
friend
of
such
a
pleasure
and
we
look
for
you
by
five
or
six
at
moray
place
or
earlier
if
you
weary
for
it
soon
dark
at
this
time
of
the
year
to
find
himself
thus
arrested
in
the
first
day
of
his
emancipation
and
put
into
the
hands
of
a
conductor
was
so
annoying
yet
so
comic
that
walter
resentment
evaporated
in
the
ludicrous
nature
of
the
situation
and
his
consciousness
that
otherwise
he
would
not
know
what
to
do
with
himself
but
requires
a
warmer
inspiration
than
this
and
even
the
amusement
of
beholding
his
companion
enthusiasm
over
all
the
dark
entries
and
inscriptions
was
not
enough
to
keep
interest
alive
his
own
life
at
this
moment
was
so
much
more
interesting
than
anything
else
so
much
more
important
than
those
relics
of
a
past
which
had
gone
away
altogether
out
of
mortal
ken
when
the
blood
is
at
high
pressure
in
our
veins
and
the
future
lying
all
before
us
it
is
very
difficult
to
turn
back
and
force
our
eager
eyes
into
contemplation
of
scenes
with
which
we
ourselves
have
little
or
no
connection
the
antiquary
however
was
not
to
be
baulked
he
looked
at
his
young
companion
with
his
head
on
one
side
like
a
critical
bird
you
are
paying
no
attention
to
me
he
said
half
pathetically
but
man
i
beg
your
pardon
my
lord
ye
be
interested
before
i
done
with
this
threat
he
hurried
walter
along
to
the
noisiest
and
most
squalid
part
of
that
noble
but
miserable
street
which
is
the
pride
of
edinburgh
and
stopped
short
before
a
small
but
deep
doorway
entering
from
a
short
flight
of
outside
stairs
the
door
was
black
with
age
and
neglect
and
showed
a
sort
of
black
cave
within
out
of
which
all
kind
of
dingy
figures
were
fluttering
the
aspect
of
the
muddy
stairs
and
ragged
wayfarers
was
miserable
enough
but
the
mouldings
of
the
lintel
and
the
spiral
staircase
half
visible
at
one
side
were
of
a
grim
antiquity
and
so
was
the
lofty
tenement
above
with
its
many
rows
of
windows
and
gable
now
just
look
here
said
bannatyne
these
arms
will
tell
their
own
story
there
was
a
projecting
boss
of
rude
carving
on
the
door
i
can
not
make
head
nor
tail
of
it
said
the
young
man
his
patience
was
beginning
to
give
way
lord
erradeen
cried
the
other
with
enthusiasm
this
is
worth
your
fattest
farm
it
is
of
more
interest
than
half
your
inheritance
it
is
as
historical
as
holyrood
you
are
just
awfully
insensible
you
young
men
and
think
as
little
of
the
relics
that
gave
you
your
consequences
in
the
world
he
paused
a
little
in
the
fervour
of
his
indignation
then
added
but
there
are
allowances
to
be
made
for
you
as
you
were
bred
in
england
and
perhaps
are
little
acquainted
my
lord
this
is
close
bearing
the
name
even
now
in
its
decay
it
was
my
lord
methven
lodging
in
the
old
time
bless
me
can
your
young
eyes
not
read
the
motto
that
many
people
have
found
so
significant
look
here
cried
walter
cicerone
tracing
with
his
stick
the
letters
baithe
sune
and
syne
young
lord
erradeen
began
as
was
natural
to
feel
ashamed
of
himself
he
felt
a
pang
of
discomfort
too
for
this
certainly
bore
no
resemblance
to
the
trim
piece
of
modern
latin
about
the
conquering
power
of
virtue
which
was
on
his
father
seal
the
old
possibility
that
he
might
turn
out
an
impostor
after
all
gleamed
across
his
mind
does
this
belong
to
me
he
added
with
some
eagerness
to
veil
these
other
and
less
easy
sentiments
i
know
nothing
about
that
said
bannatyne
with
a
slight
tone
of
contempt
but
it
was
the
lord
of
methven
lodging
in
the
days
when
scots
lords
lived
in
the
canongate
of
edinburgh
then
he
added
there
is
a
fine
mantelpiece
which
you
had
better
see
oh
nobody
will
have
any
objection
a
silver
key
opens
every
door
hereabout
if
it
should
happen
to
be
yours
my
lord
and
i
were
you
said
the
eager
little
man
i
would
clear
out
the
whole
clanjamfry
and
have
it
thoroughly
cleaned
and
make
a
museum
of
the
place
you
would
pick
up
many
a
curious
bit
as
the
auld
houses
go
down
this
way
to
the
right
and
mind
the
hole
in
the
wall
the
doors
are
all
carved
if
you
can
see
them
for
the
dirt
and
you
not
often
see
a
handsomer
room
it
was
confusing
at
first
to
emerge
out
of
the
gloom
of
the
stairs
into
the
light
of
the
great
room
with
its
row
of
windows
guiltless
of
either
blind
or
curtain
which
was
in
possession
of
a
group
of
ragged
children
squatting
about
in
front
of
the
deep
chimney
over
which
a
series
of
elaborate
carvings
rose
to
the
roof
the
room
had
once
been
panelled
but
half
of
the
woodwork
had
been
dragged
down
and
the
rest
was
in
a
deplorable
state
the
contrast
of
the
squalor
and
wretchedness
about
him
with
the
framework
of
the
ancient
grandeur
at
once
excited
and
distressed
walter
there
was
a
bed
or
rather
a
heap
of
something
covered
with
the
bright
patches
of
an
old
quilt
in
one
corner
in
another
an
old
corner
cupboard
fixed
into
the
wall
a
rickety
table
and
two
chairs
in
the
middle
of
the
room
the
solemn
unsheltered
windows
like
so
many
hollow
staring
eyes
gazed
out
through
the
cold
veil
of
the
mist
upon
the
many
windows
of
an
equally
tall
house
on
the
other
side
of
the
street
the
view
being
broken
by
a
projecting
pole
thrust
forth
from
the
middle
one
upon
which
some
dingy
clothes
were
hanging
to
dry
the
children
hung
together
getting
behind
the
biggest
of
them
a
ragged
handsome
girl
with
wild
elf
locks
who
confronted
the
visitors
with
an
air
of
defiance
the
flooring
was
broken
in
many
places
and
dirty
beyond
description
walter
felt
it
intolerable
to
be
here
to
breathe
the
stifling
atmosphere
to
contemplate
this
hideous
form
of
decay
he
thought
some
one
was
looking
at
him
from
behind
the
torn
panels
this
is
horrible
he
said
i
hope
i
have
nothing
to
do
with
it
disgust
and
a
shivering
visionary
dread
was
in
his
voice
your
race
has
had
plenty
to
do
with
it
said
the
antiquary
it
was
here
they
say
that
the
played
most
of
his
pliskies
it
was
his
study
of
deals
like
that
they
made
for
john
knox
on
the
other
side
of
the
street
these
walls
have
seen
strange
sights
and
if
you
believe
in
witchcraft
as
one
of
your
name
ought
why
should
one
of
my
name
believe
in
witchcraft
it
appears
he
said
with
petulance
that
i
know
very
little
about
my
name
so
i
should
have
said
said
the
antiquary
dryly
but
no
doubt
you
have
heard
of
your
great
ancestor
the
i
am
not
saying
that
i
admire
the
character
in
the
abstract
but
an
ancestor
like
that
is
fine
for
a
family
he
was
mixed
up
in
all
the
doings
of
the
time
and
he
made
his
own
out
of
every
one
of
them
and
then
he
a
grand
historical
problem
to
the
present
day
which
is
no
small
distinction
you
never
heard
of
that
oh
my
lord
that
just
not
possible
he
was
the
one
whose
death
was
never
proved
nor
nothing
about
him
where
he
was
buried
or
the
nature
of
his
end
or
if
he
ever
came
to
an
end
at
all
his
son
would
never
take
the
title
and
forbade
son
to
do
it
but
by
the
time
you
have
got
to
the
second
generation
you
are
not
minding
so
much
i
noticed
that
the
late
lord
would
never
enter
into
conversation
on
the
subject
the
family
has
always
been
touchy
about
it
it
was
the
most
complete
disappearance
i
can
recollect
hearing
of
most
historical
puzzles
clear
themselves
up
in
time
but
this
never
was
cleared
up
of
course
it
has
given
rise
to
legends
you
will
perhaps
be
more
interested
in
the
family
legends
lord
erradeen
not
at
all
said
walter
abruptly
i
have
told
you
i
know
very
little
about
the
family
what
is
it
we
came
to
see
not
this
wretched
place
which
makes
me
sick
the
past
should
carry
off
its
shell
with
it
and
not
leave
these
old
clothes
to
rot
here
oh
cried
little
bannatyne
with
a
shudder
i
never
suspected
i
was
bringing
in
an
iconoclast
that
mantelpiece
is
a
grand
work
of
art
lord
erradeen
look
at
that
serpent
twisted
about
among
the
drapery
you
not
see
such
work
now
and
the
ermine
on
that
mantle
just
stands
out
in
every
hair
for
all
the
grime
and
the
smoke
it
is
the
legend
beneath
the
shield
that
is
most
interesting
in
the
point
of
view
of
the
family
it
a
sort
of
rhyming
slogan
or
rather
it
an
addition
to
the
old
slogan
which
everybody
knows
walter
felt
a
mingled
attraction
and
repulsion
which
held
him
there
undecided
in
front
of
the
great
old
fireplace
like
hercules
or
any
other
hero
between
the
symbolical
good
and
evil
he
had
a
great
curiosity
to
know
what
all
this
meant
mingled
with
an
angry
disinclination
impossible
to
put
into
words
bannatyne
who
of
course
knew
nothing
of
what
was
going
on
in
his
mind
took
upon
himself
the
congenial
task
of
tracing
the
inscription
out
it
was
doggerel
bad
enough
to
satisfy
every
aspiration
of
an
antiquary
it
was
as
follows
né
fleyt
atte
helle
né
fond
for
heeven
live
you
will
see
how
it
fits
in
with
the
other
motto
cried
the
enthusiast
sune
and
syne
which
has
a
grand
kind
of
indifference
to
time
and
all
its
changes
that
just
delights
me
and
the
other
has
the
same
sentiment
frightened
for
hell
nor
keen
about
heaven
it
is
the
height
of
impiety
he
said
with
a
subdued
chuckle
but
that
not
inappropriate
it
far
from
inappropriate
it
is
just
in
fact
what
might
have
been
expected
the
warlock
lord
i
hope
you
wo
think
me
ungrateful
cried
walter
but
i
do
think
i
want
to
know
any
more
about
that
old
ruffian
there
is
something
in
the
place
that
oppresses
me
he
took
out
from
his
pocket
a
handful
of
coins
it
was
with
the
pleasure
of
novelty
that
he
shook
them
together
gold
and
silver
in
one
shining
heap
and
threw
half
a
dozen
of
them
to
the
little
group
before
the
fire
for
heaven
sake
let
us
get
out
of
this
he
said
nervously
he
could
not
have
explained
the
sentiment
of
horror
almost
of
fear
that
was
in
his
mind
if
it
is
mine
he
said
as
they
went
down
the
spiral
stair
groping
against
the
black
humid
wall
i
shall
pull
it
down
and
let
in
some
air
and
clear
the
filth
away
god
bless
me
cried
the
antiquary
in
horror
and
distress
you
will
never
do
that
the
finest
street
in
christendom
and
one
of
the
best
houses
no
no
lord
erradeen
you
will
never
do
that
when
bannatyne
got
back
to
the
club
he
expressed
an
opinion
of
lord
erradeen
which
we
are
glad
to
believe
further
experience
induced
him
to
modify
he
declared
that
old
bob
milnathort
had
given
him
such
a
handful
as
he
had
not
undertaken
for
years
just
a
young
cockney
he
said
a
stupid
englishman
with
no
more
understanding
of
history
or
even
of
the
share
his
own
race
has
had
in
it
than
that
collie
dog
indeed
yarrow
is
far
more
intelligent
and
a
brute
that
is
conscious
of
a
fine
descent
i
am
not
saying
that
there
are
not
fine
lads
among
some
of
those
young
men
and
some
that
have
the
sense
to
like
things
but
this
young
fellow
is
just
a
cockney
he
is
just
a
young
cynic
pull
down
the
house
said
he
spoil
the
first
street
in
europe
we
see
what
the
town
council
not
to
say
the
woods
and
forests
will
say
to
that
my
young
man
and
i
hope
i
have
bailie
brown
under
my
thumb
the
enraged
antiquary
cried
meantime
walter
made
his
way
through
the
dark
streets
in
a
tremor
of
excitement
and
dislike
of
which
he
could
give
no
explanation
to
himself
why
should
the
old
house
have
affected
him
so
strongly
there
was
no
reason
for
it
that
he
knew
perhaps
there
was
something
in
the
suddenness
of
the
transition
from
the
comfortable
english
prose
of
sloebury
to
all
these
old
world
scenes
and
suggestions
which
had
a
disenchanting
effect
upon
him
he
had
not
been
aware
that
he
was
more
matter
of
fact
than
another
less
likely
to
be
affected
by
romance
and
historical
associations
but
so
it
had
turned
out
the
grimy
squalor
of
the
place
the
bad
atmosphere
the
odious
associations
had
either
destroyed
for
him
all
the
more
attractive
prejudices
of
long
family
descent
and
a
name
which
had
descended
through
many
generations
or
else
something
more
subtle
still
some
internal
influence
had
communicated
that
loathing
and
sickness
of
the
heart
which
was
it
he
could
not
tell
he
said
to
himself
with
a
sort
of
scorn
at
himself
that
probably
the
bourgeois
atmosphere
of
sloebury
had
made
him
incapable
of
those
imaginative
flights
for
which
the
highest
and
the
lowest
classes
have
a
mutual
aptitude
the
atmosphere
of
comfort
and
respectability
was
against
it
this
idea
rather
exasperated
him
and
he
dwelt
upon
it
with
a
natural
perversity
because
he
hated
to
identify
himself
as
one
of
that
stolid
middle
class
which
is
above
or
beneath
fanciful
impulses
then
he
began
to
wonder
whether
all
this
might
not
be
part
of
a
scheme
on
the
part
of
old
milnathort
to
get
him
walter
under
his
power
no
doubt
it
was
arranged
that
he
should
be
brought
to
that
intolerable
place
and
all
the
spells
of
the
past
called
forth
to
subdue
him
by
his
imagination
if
never
through
his
intellect
what
did
they
take
him
for
he
was
no
credulous
celt
but
a
englishman
not
likely
to
let
his
imagination
run
away
with
him
or
to
be
led
by
the
nose
by
any
however
skilful
they
might
make
up
their
minds
to
it
that
their
wiles
of
this
kind
would
meet
with
no
success
walter
was
by
no
means
sure
who
he
meant
by
or
why
they
should
endeavour
to
get
him
into
their
power
but
he
wanted
something
to
find
fault
with
some
way
of
shaking
off
the
burden
of
a
mental
weight
which
he
did
not
understand
which
filled
him
with
discomfort
and
new
sensations
which
he
could
not
explain
he
could
almost
have
supposed
had
he
believed
in
mesmerism
according
to
the
description
given
of
it
in
fiction
that
he
was
under
some
mesmeric
influence
and
that
some
expert
some
adept
was
trying
to
decoy
him
within
some
fatal
circle
of
impression
but
he
set
his
teeth
and
all
his
power
of
resistance
against
it
they
should
not
find
him
an
easy
prey
chapter
viii
the
in
moray
place
seemed
in
the
partial
gloom
very
large
and
lofty
it
must
be
remembered
that
walter
was
accustomed
only
to
the
comparatively
small
rooms
of
an
english
country
town
where
there
was
nobody
who
was
very
rich
and
the
solid
tall
edinburgh
houses
were
imposing
to
him
there
was
no
light
but
that
which
came
from
a
blazing
fire
and
which
threw
an
irregular
ruddy
illumination
upon
everything
but
no
distinct
vision
he
saw
the
tall
windows
indefinitely
draped
and
looking
not
unlike
three
colossal
women
in
abundant
vague
robes
standing
against
the
wall
in
a
smaller
room
behind
which
opened
from
this
the
firelight
was
still
brighter
but
still
only
partially
lit
up
the
darkness
it
showed
however
a
table
placed
near
the
fire
and
glowing
with
bright
reflections
from
its
silver
and
china
and
just
beyond
that
out
of
the
depths
of
what
looked
like
an
elongated
a
piece
of
whiteness
which
was
a
female
countenance
walter
confused
at
his
entrance
made
out
after
a
moment
that
it
was
a
lady
half
reclining
on
a
sort
of
invalid
who
raised
herself
slightly
to
receive
him
with
a
flicker
of
a
pair
of
white
attenuated
hands
you
are
very
welcome
lord
erradeen
she
said
in
a
sweet
feeble
voice
will
you
excuse
my
rising
for
i
a
great
invalid
and
come
and
sit
down
here
beside
me
i
have
been
looking
for
you
this
past
the
hand
which
she
held
out
to
him
was
so
thin
that
he
scarcely
felt
its
light
pressure
if
you
have
no
objection
said
miss
milnathort
we
will
do
with
the
firelight
for
a
little
longer
it
is
my
favourite
light
my
brother
sent
me
word
i
was
to
expect
you
and
after
your
cold
walk
you
will
be
glad
of
a
cup
of
tea
she
did
not
pause
for
any
reply
but
went
on
drawing
the
table
towards
her
and
arranging
everything
with
the
skill
of
an
accustomed
hand
i
am
just
a
cripple
creature
she
said
i
have
had
to
learn
to
serve
myself
in
this
way
and
robert
is
extraordinarily
thoughtful
there
is
not
a
mechanical
convenience
invented
but
i
have
it
before
it
is
well
out
of
the
brain
that
devised
it
and
that
is
how
i
get
on
so
well
with
no
backbone
to
speak
of
all
this
is
quite
new
to
you
she
said
quickly
shaking
off
one
subject
and
taking
up
another
with
a
little
swift
movement
of
her
head
do
you
mean
edinburgh
or
i
mean
everything
said
the
lady
edinburgh
will
be
just
a
bit
of
scenery
in
the
drama
that
is
opening
upon
you
and
here
am
i
just
another
tableau
i
can
see
it
all
myself
with
your
young
eyes
you
can
scarcely
tell
if
it
is
real
that
is
true
enough
said
walter
and
the
scenery
all
turns
upon
the
plot
so
far
which
is
what
it
does
not
always
do
upon
the
stage
ay
said
miss
milnathort
with
a
tone
of
surprise
and
how
may
that
be
i
do
see
any
particular
significance
in
holyrood
it
is
where
all
you
english
strangers
go
as
if
edinburgh
had
no
meaning
but
queen
mary
we
did
not
go
to
holyrood
we
went
to
lord
methven
lodging
as
i
hear
it
is
called
which
was
highly
appropriate
dear
me
said
the
lady
do
you
mean
to
tell
me
that
john
bannatyne
had
that
sense
in
him
i
will
remember
that
the
next
time
robert
calls
him
an
auld
foozle
and
so
you
saw
the
lodging
of
methven
i
have
never
seen
it
myself
did
it
not
make
your
heart
sick
to
see
all
the
poverty
and
misery
in
that
awful
street
oh
yes
i
told
it
a
grand
street
but
i
never
have
the
heart
to
go
into
it
i
think
the
place
should
die
with
the
age
that
gave
it
birth
this
was
a
sentiment
so
entirely
unlike
what
walter
had
expected
to
hear
that
for
the
moment
it
took
from
him
all
power
of
reply
that
would
be
hard
upon
antiquity
he
said
at
length
and
i
do
know
what
the
artists
would
say
or
our
friend
mr
bannatyne
he
would
have
me
burnt
for
a
witch
the
invalid
said
with
a
sweet
little
laugh
and
then
she
added
ah
it
is
very
well
to
talk
about
art
but
there
was
great
sense
in
that
saying
of
the
old
reformers
down
the
nest
and
the
crows
will
flee
away
i
expected
said
walter
to
find
you
full
of
reverence
for
the
past
and
faith
in
mysteries
and
family
secrets
and
how
can
i
tell
ghosts
perhaps
he
laughed
but
the
invalid
did
not
echo
his
laugh
and
this
brought
a
little
chill
and
check
to
his
satisfaction
the
sense
that
one
has
suddenly
struck
a
jarring
note
is
highly
uncomfortable
when
one
is
young
walter
put
back
his
chair
a
little
not
reflecting
that
the
firelight
revealed
very
little
of
his
sudden
blush
i
have
had
no
experience
in
what
you
call
ghosts
she
said
gravely
i
can
not
to
tell
the
truth
see
any
argument
against
them
except
just
that
we
do
see
them
and
i
think
that
a
pity
for
my
part
to
this
as
it
was
a
view
of
the
subject
equally
new
to
him
walter
made
no
reply
take
you
care
lord
erradeen
she
resumed
hastily
not
to
let
yourself
be
persuaded
to
adopt
that
sort
of
nomenclature
there
was
a
touch
of
scotch
in
her
accent
that
naturalised
the
long
word
and
made
it
quite
in
keeping
conclude
nothing
to
be
a
ghost
till
you
can
not
account
for
it
in
any
other
way
there
are
many
things
that
are
far
more
surprising
she
said
then
shaking
off
the
subject
once
more
with
that
little
movement
of
her
head
you
are
not
taking
your
tea
you
must
have
had
a
tiring
day
after
travelling
all
night
that
is
one
of
the
modern
fashions
i
can
not
make
up
my
mind
to
they
tell
me
the
railway
is
not
so
wearying
as
the
long
coach
journeys
we
used
to
make
in
the
old
time
but
you
can
scarcely
remember
the
old
coach
journeys
why
my
mother
very
likely
i
am
older
than
your
mother
and
i
rarely
budge
out
of
this
corner
i
have
never
seen
your
mother
but
i
remember
captain
methven
long
long
ago
who
was
not
unlike
the
general
outline
of
you
so
far
as
i
can
make
out
when
the
light
comes
you
will
see
i
am
an
old
woman
it
is
just
possible
that
this
is
why
i
am
so
fond
of
the
firelight
she
said
with
a
laugh
for
i
really
very
young
though
i
was
born
long
ago
robert
and
me
we
remember
all
our
games
and
plays
in
a
way
that
people
that
have
had
children
of
their
own
never
do
we
are
just
boy
and
girl
still
and
i
known
us
after
a
long
talk
forget
ourselves
altogether
and
talk
of
papa
and
mamma
she
clapped
her
hands
together
at
this
and
went
into
a
peal
of
genuine
laughter
such
as
is
always
infectious
walter
laughed
too
but
in
a
way
all
was
so
strange
to
him
and
this
curious
introduction
into
a
uncomprehended
world
the
most
curious
of
all
i
would
like
to
know
a
little
about
yourself
she
resumed
after
a
moment
you
were
not
in
the
secret
that
it
was
you
who
were
the
kin
it
was
strange
your
father
should
have
left
you
in
the
dark
i
ca
remember
my
father
said
walter
hastily
that
makes
little
difference
but
you
were
always
a
strange
family
now
you
robert
tells
me
you
not
so
very
much
of
an
erradeen
you
take
after
your
mother
side
and
i
very
very
glad
to
hear
it
it
will
perhaps
be
you
if
you
have
the
courage
that
will
put
a
stop
to
many
things
there
are
old
rhymes
upon
that
subject
but
you
will
put
little
faith
in
old
rhymes
i
none
at
all
i
believe
they
are
just
made
up
long
after
the
occasion
just
for
the
sake
of
the
fun
or
perhaps
because
some
one
is
pleased
with
himself
to
have
found
a
rhyme
now
that
one
that
they
tell
me
is
in
the
canongate
that
about
i
thought
you
said
you
did
know
it
i
have
never
seen
it
but
you
do
suppose
i
am
ignorant
of
the
subject
lord
erradeen
do
you
know
i
have
been
here
stretched
out
in
my
chair
these
thirty
years
and
what
else
could
i
give
my
attention
to
considering
all
things
well
i
do
not
believe
in
that
oh
it
far
too
pat
when
a
thing
is
true
it
is
not
just
so
terribly
in
keeping
i
believe
it
was
made
up
by
somebody
that
knew
the
story
just
as
we
do
probably
a
hundred
years
or
more
after
the
event
walter
did
not
say
that
he
was
quite
unacquainted
with
the
event
his
interest
perhaps
though
he
was
not
aware
of
it
was
a
little
less
warm
since
he
knew
that
miss
milnathort
was
his
mother
contemporary
rather
than
his
own
but
he
had
come
to
the
conclusion
that
it
was
better
not
to
ask
any
direct
questions
the
light
had
faded
much
and
was
now
nothing
more
than
a
steady
red
glow
in
place
of
the
leaping
and
blazing
of
the
flames
he
scarcely
saw
his
entertainer
at
all
there
were
two
spots
of
brightness
which
moved
occasionally
and
which
represented
her
face
and
the
hands
which
she
had
clasped
together
when
they
were
not
flickering
about
in
incessant
gesture
in
her
lap
but
there
was
something
altogether
quaint
and
strange
in
the
situation
it
did
not
irritate
him
as
the
men
had
done
and
then
she
had
the
good
sense
to
agree
with
him
in
some
respects
though
the
of
opinions
in
her
was
remarkable
and
he
did
not
understand
what
she
would
be
at
there
was
an
interval
of
quiet
in
which
neither
of
them
said
anything
and
then
a
large
step
was
audible
coming
slowly
and
through
the
other
drawing
room
here
is
robert
the
invalid
said
with
a
smile
in
her
voice
it
was
nothing
but
a
tall
shadow
that
appeared
looming
huge
in
the
ruddy
light
have
you
got
lord
erradeen
with
you
alison
and
how
are
you
and
he
getting
on
together
said
old
milnathort
voice
walter
rose
hastily
to
his
feet
with
a
feeling
that
other
elements
less
agreeable
were
at
once
introduced
and
that
his
pride
was
affronted
by
being
discussed
in
this
easy
manner
over
his
head
we
are
getting
on
fine
robert
he
is
just
as
agreeable
as
you
say
and
i
have
great
hopes
will
be
the
man
but
you
are
late
and
it
will
soon
be
time
for
dinner
i
would
advise
you
to
show
our
young
gentleman
to
his
room
and
see
that
he
comfortable
and
after
dinner
when
you
have
had
your
good
meal
we
have
it
all
out
with
him
i
am
thinking
alison
that
there
is
a
good
deal
we
must
go
over
that
will
be
best
between
him
and
me
that
must
be
as
you
please
robert
my
man
said
the
lady
and
walter
felt
like
a
small
child
who
is
being
discussed
over
his
head
by
persons
whom
he
feels
to
be
his
natural
enemies
he
rose
willingly
yet
with
unconscious
offence
and
followed
his
host
to
his
room
inwardly
indignant
with
himself
for
having
thus
impaired
his
own
liberty
by
forsaking
his
inn
the
room
however
was
luxuriously
comfortable
shining
with
firelight
and
a
grave
and
respectable
servant
in
mourning
was
arranging
his
evening
clothes
upon
the
bed
this
is
symington
said
milnathort
he
was
your
late
cousin
the
late
lord
erradeen
gave
him
a
very
warm
recommendation
there
might
be
things
perhaps
in
which
he
would
be
of
use
thanks
said
walter
impulsively
i
have
a
man
coming
i
am
afraid
the
recommendation
is
a
little
too
late
this
unfortunately
was
not
true
but
the
young
man
felt
that
to
allow
himself
to
be
saddled
with
a
sort
of
governor
in
the
shape
of
the
late
lord
servant
was
more
than
could
be
required
of
him
and
that
he
must
assert
himself
before
it
was
too
late
you
will
settle
that
at
your
pleasure
my
lord
said
old
milnathort
and
he
went
away
shutting
the
door
carefully
his
steady
slow
step
echoing
along
the
passage
the
man
was
not
apparently
in
the
least
daunted
by
walter
irritation
he
went
on
mechanically
lightly
brushing
out
a
crease
and
unfolding
the
coat
with
that
affectionate
care
which
a
good
servant
bestows
upon
good
clothes
walter
longed
to
have
brought
his
old
coat
with
him
that
everything
should
not
have
been
so
distressingly
new
that
will
do
he
said
that
will
do
it
is
a
pity
to
give
you
so
much
trouble
when
as
i
tell
you
i
have
another
man
engaged
it
is
no
trouble
my
lord
it
is
a
pleasure
i
came
out
of
attachment
to
the
family
i
been
many
years
about
my
late
lord
and
however
ye
may
remind
yourself
that
you
are
but
a
servant
and
service
is
no
heritage
yet
it
not
easy
to
keep
yourself
from
becoming
attached
my
good
man
said
walter
half
impatient
half
touched
you
never
saw
me
in
your
life
before
i
ca
see
how
you
can
have
any
attachment
to
me
symington
had
a
long
face
with
a
somewhat
lugubrious
expression
contradicted
by
the
twinkle
of
a
pair
of
humorous
eyes
he
gave
a
glance
up
at
walter
from
where
he
stood
fondling
the
lappels
of
the
new
coat
there
are
many
kinds
of
attachments
my
lord
he
said
oracularly
some
to
the
person
and
some
to
the
race
for
a
number
of
years
past
i
have
so
to
speak
just
identified
myself
with
the
erradeens
it
not
common
in
england
so
far
as
i
can
hear
but
it
just
our
old
scots
way
i
will
take
no
other
service
so
being
free
if
your
lordship
pleases
i
will
just
look
after
your
lordship
things
till
the
other
man
comes
walter
perceived
in
a
moment
by
the
way
symington
said
these
words
that
he
had
no
faith
whatever
in
the
other
man
he
submitted
accordingly
to
the
ministrations
of
the
family
retainer
with
a
great
deal
of
his
old
impatience
tempered
by
a
sense
of
the
humour
of
the
situation
it
seemed
that
he
was
never
to
have
any
control
over
himself
he
had
barely
escaped
from
the
tutelage
of
home
when
he
fell
into
this
other
which
was
much
more
rigid
poor
mother
he
said
to
himself
with
an
affectionate
recollection
of
her
many
cares
her
anxious
watchfulness
and
laughed
to
himself
at
the
thought
that
she
was
being
avenged
milnathort
table
was
handsome
and
liberal
the
meal
even
too
abundant
for
the
solitary
pair
who
sat
alone
at
a
corner
of
the
large
table
amid
a
blaze
of
light
miss
milnathort
did
not
appear
she
never
comes
down
she
has
never
sat
down
at
table
since
she
had
her
accident
and
that
is
thirty
years
since
there
was
something
in
milnathort
tone
as
he
said
this
that
made
walter
believe
that
her
accident
too
had
something
to
do
with
the
family
everything
tended
towards
that
or
sprang
from
it
had
he
been
to
the
manner
born
this
would
no
doubt
have
seemed
to
him
natural
enough
but
as
it
was
he
could
not
keep
himself
from
the
idea
either
that
he
was
being
laughed
at
or
that
some
design
was
hidden
beneath
this
constant
reference
the
dinner
however
went
off
quietly
it
was
impossible
to
discuss
anything
of
a
private
character
in
the
presence
of
milnathort
serious
butler
and
of
the
doubly
grave
apparition
of
symington
who
helped
the
other
to
wait
walter
had
never
dined
so
solemnly
before
it
must
be
added
however
that
he
had
seldom
dined
so
well
it
was
a
pity
that
he
was
so
little
knowing
in
this
particular
milnathort
encouraged
him
through
the
repast
by
judicious
words
of
advice
and
recommendation
he
was
very
genial
and
expansive
at
this
most
generous
moment
of
the
day
fond
of
good
fare
himself
he
liked
to
communicate
and
recommend
it
and
appetite
was
excellent
if
perhaps
his
taste
was
uncultivated
the
two
noiseless
attendants
circulating
about
the
table
served
them
with
a
gravity
in
perfect
keeping
with
the
importance
of
the
event
which
was
to
the
old
lawyer
the
most
interesting
of
the
day
when
they
were
left
alone
finally
the
aspect
of
affairs
changed
a
little
milnathort
cleared
his
throat
and
laid
aside
his
napkin
he
said
we
must
not
forget
lord
erradeen
that
we
have
a
great
deal
of
business
to
get
through
but
you
have
had
a
fatiguing
day
and
probably
very
little
sleep
last
night
i
slept
very
well
i
assure
you
walter
replied
cheerfully
ay
ay
you
are
young
said
milnathort
with
a
still
all
the
financial
statements
and
to
give
you
a
just
view
of
all
coming
to
you
will
take
time
with
your
permission
we
keep
that
till
but
there
just
a
thing
or
two
lord
save
us
he
cried
suddenly
you
not
the
kind
of
person
for
this
there
is
many
a
one
i
know
that
would
have
liked
it
all
the
better
till
they
knew
for
attached
to
it
i
thought
as
much
when
i
first
set
eyes
upon
you
this
will
be
one
that
will
not
take
it
all
for
gospel
i
said
to
myself
one
that
will
set
up
his
own
judgment
and
demand
the
reason
why
walter
a
little
uncertain
at
first
how
to
take
this
ended
by
being
gratified
with
such
an
estimate
of
himself
it
showed
he
felt
more
perception
than
he
had
looked
for
and
he
answered
with
a
little
complacency
i
hope
you
think
that
is
the
right
way
of
approaching
a
new
subject
i
am
not
unbiased
myself
said
the
lawyer
and
i
have
had
to
do
with
it
all
my
life
there
are
conditions
connected
with
your
inheritance
lord
erradeen
that
may
seem
out
of
the
way
to
a
stranger
if
you
had
succeeded
in
the
way
of
nature
as
your
father
son
they
would
not
have
been
new
to
you
and
you
would
have
been
prepared
in
that
way
it
is
hard
upon
you
there
was
one
of
your
ancestors
that
laid
certain
conditions
as
i
was
saying
upon
every
heir
he
was
one
that
had
as
you
may
say
a
good
right
to
do
that
or
whatever
else
he
pleased
seeing
he
was
the
making
of
the
family
in
old
days
it
was
no
more
than
a
bit
small
highland
lairdship
it
was
he
that
gave
it
consequence
but
he
has
held
a
heavy
hand
upon
his
successors
ever
since
would
it
be
he
by
any
chance
of
whom
bannatyne
was
discoursing
to
me
said
walter
under
the
title
of
the
ah
john
bannatyne
took
that
upon
him
cried
milnathort
with
vivacity
his
eyes
gleamed
from
under
his
brows
the
less
a
man
knows
the
more
ready
he
is
to
instruct
the
world
but
i
never
thought
he
would
take
that
upon
him
so
you
see
as
i
was
saying
there
are
certain
formalities
to
go
through
it
is
understood
that
once
a
year
wherever
he
may
be
lord
erradeen
should
pass
say
a
week
say
two
or
three
days
in
the
old
castle
of
kinloch
houran
which
is
the
old
seat
of
the
family
the
original
of
the
methven
race
walter
had
been
listening
with
some
anxiety
he
drew
a
long
breath
as
milnathort
came
to
a
pause
is
that
all
he
cried
with
a
voice
of
relief
then
he
laughed
i
was
winding
myself
up
to
something
heroic
but
if
it
is
only
a
periodical
retirement
to
an
old
castle
to
think
i
suppose
upon
one
sins
and
examine
one
conscience
something
very
like
that
said
the
old
man
somewhat
grimly
well
it
might
be
a
great
inconvenience
but
there
is
nothing
very
appalling
in
the
prospect
if
that
is
all
it
is
all
lord
erradeen
if
ye
except
what
passes
there
a
thing
that
is
your
own
concern
and
that
i
have
never
pried
into
for
my
part
and
just
this
beside
that
you
are
expected
there
at
once
and
without
delay
expected
at
once
and
without
delay
walter
grew
red
with
anger
at
these
peremptory
words
this
sounds
a
little
arbitrary
he
said
expected
by
whom
and
to
what
purpose
i
do
understand
nor
do
i
my
young
lord
but
it
so
in
the
documents
and
so
has
it
been
with
every
lord
of
erradeen
up
to
this
period
it
is
the
first
thing
to
be
done
before
you
come
into
enjoyment
of
anything
or
take
your
place
in
the
country
there
is
this
visit
if
you
like
to
call
it
a
visit
this
sojourn
not
a
long
one
at
least
you
may
be
thankful
to
be
made
to
what
purpose
walter
repeated
almost
mechanically
he
could
not
himself
understand
the
sudden
tempest
of
resistance
of
anger
of
alarm
that
got
up
within
him
there
is
reason
in
everything
he
said
growing
pale
what
is
it
for
what
am
i
to
do
lord
erradeen
a
minute
since
you
said
was
that
all
and
now
you
change
colour
you
ask
why
and
wherefore
walter
made
a
great
effort
to
regain
command
of
himself
it
is
inconsistent
i
allow
he
said
somehow
the
order
to
go
now
is
irritating
and
unpleasant
i
suppose
it
simple
enough
a
piece
of
tyranny
such
as
people
seem
to
think
they
may
indulge
in
after
dead
but
it
is
abominably
arbitrary
and
tyrannical
what
good
does
the
old
beggar
think
hold
your
peace
cried
milnathort
with
a
little
trepidation
we
have
no
right
to
call
names
and
i
would
not
like
it
to
be
thought
here
he
paused
with
a
sort
of
uneasy
smile
and
added
i
am
speaking
nonsense
with
a
vague
glance
about
him
i
think
we
might
join
my
sister
and
as
she
knows
just
as
much
as
i
do
or
maybe
more
you
can
speak
as
freely
as
you
please
before
her
oh
quite
freely
but
my
dear
young
lord
call
no
names
cried
milnathort
he
got
up
hurriedly
leaving
his
wine
which
he
had
just
filled
out
a
demonstration
of
sincerity
which
made
a
great
impression
upon
walter
and
threw
open
the
door
putting
off
the
business
details
till
i
know
nothing
else
that
we
can
not
discuss
before
alison
he
said
walter
was
much
startled
when
he
went
back
to
the
inner
and
found
it
lighted
miss
milnathort
did
not
employ
any
of
those
devices
by
which
light
is
softened
to
suit
the
exigencies
of
beauty
which
has
passed
its
prime
the
light
alas
for
the
prejudices
of
the
æsthetic
reader
was
gas
and
though
it
was
slightly
disguised
by
means
of
opal
glass
it
still
poured
down
in
a
brilliant
flood
and
the
little
room
was
almost
as
light
as
day
she
lay
in
her
placed
under
this
illumination
her
face
was
preternaturally
young
almost
childish
small
and
full
of
colour
her
hair
she
seemed
to
have
been
exempted
from
the
weight
of
years
in
compensation
perhaps
for
other
sufferings
her
skin
was
smooth
and
unwrinkled
her
eyes
full
of
dewy
brightness
like
those
of
a
girl
her
dress
so
far
as
it
was
visible
was
white
made
of
cashmere
or
some
other
woollen
material
solid
and
warm
but
with
lace
at
the
neck
and
pretty
ribbons
breaking
the
monotony
of
the
tint
she
looked
like
a
girl
dressed
for
some
simple
party
who
had
lain
there
waiting
for
the
little
festivity
to
begin
for
no
one
could
imagine
how
many
years
her
hands
were
soft
and
round
and
young
like
her
face
the
wind
had
not
been
allowed
to
visit
her
cheek
too
roughly
for
a
lifetime
what
had
happened
before
the
event
which
she
and
her
brother
had
both
referred
to
as
her
accident
belonged
to
a
period
which
had
evidently
nothing
to
do
with
the
present
walter
saw
at
a
glance
that
every
possible
convenience
which
could
be
invented
for
an
invalid
surrounded
her
she
had
a
set
of
bookshelves
at
one
side
with
vacant
spaces
where
she
could
place
the
book
she
was
reading
tables
that
wheeled
towards
her
at
a
touch
with
needlework
with
knitting
with
drawing
materials
were
arranged
within
reach
one
of
these
made
into
a
desk
and
put
itself
across
her
couch
by
another
adaptation
it
was
evident
that
the
tenderest
affection
and
care
had
made
this
prison
of
hers
into
a
sort
of
museum
of
every
ingenuity
that
had
ever
been
called
to
the
help
of
the
suffering
she
lay
or
rather
sat
for
that
was
her
general
position
with
an
air
of
pleasant
expectation
on
her
face
and
received
them
with
smiles
and
hands
held
out
come
away
come
away
she
said
in
her
soft
scotch
i
have
been
wearying
for
you
walter
thought
there
was
something
of
age
in
her
voice
but
that
might
have
been
only
the
scotch
and
the
unusual
form
of
her
salutation
she
pointed
out
a
chair
to
him
carefully
placed
for
her
convenience
in
seeing
and
hearing
come
and
tell
me
what
you
think
about
it
all
she
said
i
have
not
heard
much
said
walter
to
think
about
except
that
i
am
to
go
away
directly
which
does
not
please
me
at
all
miss
milnathort
oh
you
will
come
back
you
will
come
back
she
said
i
hope
so
but
the
reason
why
i
should
go
does
seem
very
plain
what
would
happen
i
wonder
if
i
did
walter
said
lightly
he
was
surprised
to
see
how
much
effect
was
produced
upon
his
companions
by
this
very
simple
utterance
miss
milnathort
put
her
hands
together
as
if
to
clasp
them
in
triumph
her
brother
stood
looking
down
upon
the
others
with
his
back
to
the
light
and
an
air
of
alarmed
displeasure
one
result
would
be
that
certain
of
the
lands
would
pass
to
the
next
heir
he
said
besides
perhaps
other
penalties
that
i
would
not
incur
lord
erradeen
if
i
were
you
what
penalties
but
do
you
think
at
this
time
of
day
said
walter
that
ridiculous
conditions
of
this
kind
that
can
mean
nothing
could
really
be
upheld
by
the
law
now
that
bequests
of
all
kinds
are
being
interfered
with
and
even
charities
robert
that
is
true
there
was
the
melville
mortification
that
you
had
so
much
trouble
about
and
that
was
a
charity
how
much
more
as
young
lord
erradeen
is
saying
when
it
is
just
entirely
out
of
reason
you
should
hold
your
peace
on
legal
subjects
alison
what
can
you
know
about
them
i
disapprove
of
all
interference
with
the
will
of
a
testator
lord
erradeen
i
hold
it
to
be
against
the
law
and
against
that
honour
and
honesty
that
we
owe
to
the
dead
as
well
as
the
living
but
there
has
always
been
a
license
allowed
in
respect
to
charities
so
far
as
they
are
intended
to
be
for
the
good
of
the
poor
we
have
a
right
to
see
that
the
testator
meaning
is
carried
out
even
if
it
be
contrary
to
his
stipulations
but
in
a
private
case
there
is
no
such
latitude
and
you
must
always
respect
the
testator
meaning
which
is
very
clear
in
this
case
as
even
you
will
allow
alison
ay
clear
enough
cried
the
lady
shaking
her
white
head
but
i
on
your
side
lord
erradeen
i
would
just
let
them
try
their
worst
and
see
what
would
come
of
it
if
instead
of
a
lame
woman
i
was
a
young
man
lively
and
strong
like
you
the
question
is
said
walter
for
i
have
become
prudent
since
i
have
had
property
whether
for
such
an
insignificant
affair
it
is
worth
while
losing
a
substantial
advantage
as
milnathort
says
and
then
perhaps
a
new
man
like
myself
coming
into
an
antiquated
routine
there
would
be
a
sort
of
discourtesy
a
want
of
politeness
he
laughed
one
ought
i
suppose
to
be
on
one
best
behaviour
in
such
circumstances
he
said
miss
milnathort
countenance
fell
a
little
she
did
not
make
any
reply
but
she
had
been
listening
with
an
air
so
eager
and
full
of
vivacity
anxious
to
speak
that
the
young
man
at
once
perceived
the
disappointment
in
her
expressive
little
face
he
said
quickly
that
does
not
please
you
what
would
you
have
me
to
do
with
an
involuntary
sense
that
she
had
a
right
to
an
opinion
milnathort
at
this
moment
sat
heavily
down
on
the
other
side
giving
great
emphasis
to
his
interruption
by
the
sound
of
his
chair
drawn
forward
a
sound
which
she
protested
against
with
a
sudden
contraction
of
her
forehead
putting
up
a
delicate
hand
i
beg
your
pardon
my
dear
for
making
a
noise
you
must
not
consult
alison
lord
erradeen
she
is
prejudiced
on
one
side
and
i
perhaps
i
am
if
not
prejudiced
yet
biased
on
the
other
you
must
act
on
your
own
instinct
which
as
far
as
i
can
judge
is
a
just
one
it
would
be
a
great
incivility
as
you
say
for
a
collateral
that
is
really
no
more
than
a
stranger
to
set
himself
against
the
traditions
of
a
house
walter
did
not
much
like
to
hear
himself
described
as
a
collateral
it
sounded
like
a
term
of
reproach
and
as
he
did
not
choose
to
say
anything
more
on
this
matter
he
made
the
best
change
of
subject
he
could
i
wonder
he
said
what
would
happen
with
any
of
the
fantastic
old
feudal
tenures
if
a
new
heir
a
new
man
like
myself
should
simply
refuse
to
fulfil
them
mostly
they
take
a
pride
and
a
pleasure
in
fulfilling
them
said
the
old
lawyer
but
suppose
cried
walter
for
the
sake
of
argument
that
a
new
duke
of
marlborough
should
say
rubbish
why
should
i
send
that
obsolete
old
flag
to
windsor
that
is
a
modern
instance
or
suppose
just
that
cried
miss
milnathort
striking
in
with
a
flicker
of
her
pretty
hands
suppose
young
glenearn
should
refuse
when
he
comes
of
age
to
hear
a
word
about
that
secret
what
would
happen
said
walter
with
a
laugh
of
profane
and
irreverent
youth
milnathort
rose
to
his
full
height
he
pushed
back
his
chair
with
an
indignant
movement
you
may
as
well
ask
me
he
said
what
would
happen
if
the
pillars
of
the
earth
should
give
way
it
is
a
thing
that
can
not
be
at
least
till
the
end
of
all
things
is
at
hand
i
will
ring
for
prayers
alison
my
lord
erradeen
is
young
he
knows
little
but
this
kind
of
profane
talk
is
not
to
be
justified
from
you
and
me
then
the
bell
was
rung
the
servants
came
trooping
and
symington
gave
walter
a
sidelong
look
as
he
took
his
seat
behind
their
backs
it
seemed
to
assert
a
demure
claim
of
proprietorship
along
with
a
total
want
of
faith
in
the
other
man
young
lord
erradeen
found
that
it
was
all
he
could
do
to
restrain
an
irreverent
laugh
the
position
was
so
comic
that
his
original
sense
of
angry
resistance
disappeared
before
it
he
was
going
off
against
his
will
to
pass
through
a
mysterious
ordeal
in
an
old
ruined
house
under
charge
of
a
servant
whom
he
did
not
want
and
in
obedience
to
a
stipulation
which
he
disowned
he
was
not
half
so
free
an
agent
as
he
had
been
when
he
was
poor
walter
methven
knocking
about
the
streets
of
sloebury
and
doing
much
what
he
liked
though
he
thought
himself
in
bondage
bondage
he
did
not
know
in
the
old
days
what
the
word
would
mean
chapter
ix
the
day
on
which
walter
set
out
for
kinloch
houran
was
fine
and
bright
the
sky
very
clear
the
sun
shining
the
hills
standing
out
against
the
blue
and
every
line
of
the
tall
trees
clearly
marked
upon
the
transparent
atmosphere
it
was
not
till
two
days
after
the
conversation
above
recorded
for
there
had
been
much
to
explain
and
walter
was
so
little
acquainted
with
business
that
instructions
of
various
kinds
were
necessary
miss
milnathort
was
visible
much
earlier
than
usual
on
the
morning
of
his
departure
and
he
was
admitted
to
see
her
she
was
paler
than
before
and
her
little
soft
face
was
full
of
agitation
the
corners
of
her
mouth
turned
down
and
her
upper
lip
which
was
a
trifle
too
long
quivering
this
added
rather
than
took
away
from
her
appearance
of
youth
she
was
like
a
child
who
had
exhausted
itself
with
crying
and
still
trembled
with
an
occasional
sob
she
stretched
up
her
arms
to
him
as
if
she
would
have
put
them
round
his
neck
and
bade
god
bless
him
with
a
tremulous
voice
you
must
have
plenty
of
courage
she
said
and
you
must
never
never
give
up
your
own
way
walter
was
touched
to
the
heart
by
this
look
of
trouble
on
the
innocent
face
i
thought
it
was
always
right
to
give
up
one
own
way
he
said
in
the
light
tone
which
he
had
come
to
employ
with
her
she
made
an
effort
to
smile
in
response
oh
yes
oh
yes
it
the
fashion
to
say
so
you
are
a
race
to
believe
yourselves
but
this
time
you
must
not
yield
to
whom
am
i
supposed
to
be
about
to
yield
he
asked
you
may
be
sure
i
unless
i
ca
help
myself
the
tears
overflowed
her
bright
old
eyes
her
hands
shook
as
they
held
his
god
bless
you
god
bless
you
she
said
i
will
do
nothing
but
pray
for
you
and
you
will
tell
me
when
you
come
back
he
left
her
lying
back
upon
her
cushions
sobbing
under
her
breath
all
this
the
young
man
she
was
a
very
strange
little
creature
he
felt
neither
old
nor
young
there
was
no
telling
the
reason
of
her
emotion
she
was
so
much
indulged
in
all
her
whims
like
a
spoiled
child
that
perhaps
these
tears
were
only
her
regrets
for
a
lost
playmate
at
the
same
time
walter
knew
that
this
was
not
so
and
was
angry
with
himself
for
the
thought
but
how
find
his
way
out
of
the
perplexity
he
shook
it
off
which
is
always
the
easiest
way
and
soon
the
landscape
began
to
attract
his
attention
and
he
forgot
by
degrees
that
there
was
anything
very
unusual
in
the
circumstances
of
his
journey
it
was
not
till
the
first
long
stage
of
this
journey
was
over
that
he
was
suddenly
roused
to
a
recollection
of
everything
involved
by
the
appearance
of
symington
at
the
carriage
window
respectfully
requesting
to
know
whether
he
had
wanted
anything
walter
had
not
remembered
or
if
he
had
remembered
had
thought
no
more
of
it
that
this
quietly
officious
retainer
had
taken
all
trouble
from
him
at
the
beginning
of
his
journey
as
he
had
done
during
his
stay
in
milnathort
house
what
are
you
here
he
said
with
surprise
and
a
mixture
of
amusement
and
offence
i
beg
your
pardon
my
lord
said
symington
with
profound
and
serious
respect
yet
always
a
twinkle
in
his
eye
but
as
the
other
man
did
not
turn
up
and
your
lordship
could
scarcely
travel
without
some
attendance
he
had
to
rush
behind
to
get
his
place
in
the
train
in
the
midst
of
his
sentence
and
walter
was
left
to
think
it
over
alone
in
the
balance
between
anger
and
amusement
the
latter
fortunately
won
the
day
the
comic
side
of
the
matter
came
uppermost
it
seemed
to
him
very
droll
that
he
should
be
taken
possession
of
against
his
will
by
the
valet
who
professed
an
attachment
to
the
race
not
to
the
individual
members
of
it
whose
head
was
garlanded
with
crape
in
the
quaint
scotch
way
for
walter
predecessor
and
who
had
identified
himself
with
the
erradeens
he
reminded
himself
that
he
was
in
the
country
of
caleb
balderstone
and
ritchie
moniplies
and
he
resigned
himself
to
necessity
symington
comic
yet
so
respectful
consciousness
that
the
other
man
was
a
mere
imagination
was
joke
enough
to
secure
his
pardon
and
walter
felt
that
though
the
need
of
attendance
was
quite
new
in
his
life
that
it
might
be
well
on
his
arrival
in
a
strange
country
and
a
lonely
ruined
house
to
have
some
one
with
him
who
was
not
ignorant
either
of
the
locality
or
the
household
the
country
increased
in
interest
as
he
went
on
and
by
and
by
he
forgot
himself
in
gazing
at
the
mountains
which
appeared
in
glimpses
upon
the
horizon
then
seemed
to
draw
nearer
closing
in
upon
the
road
which
led
along
by
the
head
of
one
loch
after
another
each
encompassed
by
its
circle
of
hills
walter
knew
very
little
about
scotland
he
thought
it
a
barren
and
wild
country
all
bleak
and
gloomy
and
the
lavish
vegetation
of
the
west
filled
him
with
surprise
and
admiration
the
sun
was
near
its
setting
when
the
railway
journey
came
to
an
end
and
he
found
himself
at
a
village
station
from
which
a
coach
ran
to
kinloch
houran
it
appeared
that
there
was
no
other
vehicle
to
be
had
and
though
it
was
cold
there
was
nothing
else
for
it
but
to
clamber
up
on
the
top
of
the
rude
coach
which
was
a
sort
of
without
any
interior
walter
felt
that
it
would
become
him
ill
notwithstanding
his
new
rank
to
grumble
at
the
conveyance
upon
which
there
mounted
nimbly
a
girl
whom
he
had
remarked
when
leaving
edinburgh
and
whom
he
had
watched
for
at
all
the
pauses
of
the
journey
he
thought
her
the
very
impersonation
of
all
he
had
ever
heard
of
scotch
beauty
and
so
would
most
observers
to
whom
scotland
is
a
new
country
the
native
scot
is
aware
that
there
are
as
many
brown
locks
as
golden
and
as
many
dark
maidens
as
fair
ones
in
his
own
country
but
notwithstanding
to
the
stranger
it
is
the
fair
who
is
the
type
this
young
lady
was
warmly
clothed
in
dark
tweed
of
the
ruddy
heathery
hue
which
is
now
so
general
not
long
enough
to
conceal
her
feet
closely
fitting
and
adapted
for
constant
walking
and
movement
she
seemed
to
be
met
by
friends
all
along
the
route
from
the
carriage
window
walter
saw
her
look
out
with
little
cries
of
pleasure
oh
is
that
you
jack
oh
nelly
where
are
you
going
oh
come
in
here
there
is
room
in
this
carriage
and
such
like
she
was
always
leaning
out
to
say
a
word
to
somebody
either
of
farewell
or
welcome
you
will
remember
me
to
your
mother
old
gentlemen
would
call
to
her
as
the
train
went
on
walter
was
greatly
in
want
of
amusement
and
he
was
at
the
age
when
a
girl
is
always
interesting
she
became
to
him
the
heroine
of
the
journey
he
felt
that
he
was
collecting
a
great
deal
of
information
about
her
as
they
travelled
on
and
had
begun
to
wonder
whether
he
should
ever
find
out
who
she
was
or
see
any
more
of
her
when
he
perceived
her
to
his
delight
getting
out
as
he
himself
did
at
baldally
she
was
met
by
a
respectable
woman
servant
who
took
possession
of
her
baggage
while
the
young
lady
herself
ran
across
the
road
to
the
coach
and
with
a
hearty
greeting
to
john
the
coachman
darted
up
to
the
seat
immediately
behind
him
where
her
maid
presently
joined
her
walter
and
a
personage
of
the
commercial
traveller
class
shared
the
coachman
seat
in
front
and
symington
and
some
other
humbler
passengers
sat
behind
the
coach
was
adapted
for
summer
traffic
so
that
there
were
several
lines
of
empty
seats
between
the
two
sets
of
travellers
it
gave
walter
a
great
deal
of
pleasure
to
hear
the
soft
voice
of
his
pouring
forth
low
yet
quite
audible
an
account
of
her
journey
to
her
maid
who
was
evidently
on
the
most
confidential
terms
with
her
young
mistress
has
mamma
missed
me
much
she
asked
after
the
little
odyssey
was
over
oh
miss
oona
to
ask
that
cried
the
woman
how
should
we
no
miss
you
and
then
there
ensued
a
number
of
details
on
the
home
side
the
girl
had
been
on
a
visit
in
edinburgh
and
had
gone
to
balls
and
seen
everything
on
the
other
hand
many
small
matters
faithfully
reported
had
filled
up
the
time
of
separation
walter
listened
to
all
this
innocent
interchange
with
great
amusement
and
interest
as
the
coach
made
its
way
slowly
up
the
ascents
of
the
hilly
road
it
was
not
in
itself
an
agreeable
mode
of
progression
the
wind
was
icy
cold
and
swept
through
and
through
the
unfortunates
who
faced
it
in
front
sharpening
into
almost
absolute
needle
points
of
ice
when
the
pace
quickened
and
the
noisy
jolting
vehicle
lumbered
down
the
further
side
of
a
hill
threatening
every
moment
to
pitch
the
passengers
into
the
heathery
bog
on
one
side
or
the
other
he
tried
to
diminish
his
own
discomfort
by
the
thought
that
he
took
off
the
icy
edge
of
the
gale
and
sheltered
the
little
slim
creature
in
her
close
ulster
behind
about
whose
shoulders
the
maid
had
wound
the
snowy
mass
of
a
great
white
knitted
shawl
the
low
sun
was
in
their
faces
as
they
toiled
and
rattled
along
and
the
clear
wintry
blue
of
the
sky
was
already
strewn
with
radiant
rosy
masses
of
cloud
when
they
reached
the
highest
point
of
the
road
the
dazzling
gleam
of
the
great
loch
lying
at
their
feet
and
made
into
a
mirror
of
steel
by
the
last
blaze
of
the
sun
before
it
disappeared
dazzled
the
young
man
who
could
see
nothing
except
the
cold
intolerable
brightness
but
in
a
moment
more
the
scene
disclosed
itself
hills
all
purple
in
the
sunset
clothed
with
that
ineffable
velvet
down
which
softens
every
outline
opened
out
on
either
side
showing
long
lines
of
indistinct
green
valleys
and
narrower
ravines
that
ran
between
all
converging
towards
the
broad
and
noble
inland
sea
fringed
with
dark
woods
and
broken
with
feathery
islands
which
was
the
centre
of
the
landscape
the
wonderful
colour
of
the
sky
reflected
in
the
loch
where
everything
found
a
reflection
and
every
knoll
and
island
floated
double
changed
the
character
of
the
scene
and
neutralised
the
dazzling
coldness
of
the
great
walter
involuntary
exclamation
at
this
sight
stopped
for
a
moment
all
the
conversation
going
on
by
jove
he
said
how
glorious
they
all
stopped
talking
the
coachman
the
traveller
the
woman
behind
and
looked
at
him
big
john
the
driver
who
knew
everybody
eyed
him
with
a
slightly
supercilious
air
as
one
who
felt
that
the
could
not
be
otherwise
than
contemptible
more
or
less
even
though
his
sentiments
were
irreproachable
ay
sir
so
that
your
opinion
most
folk
have
been
beforehand
with
ye
said
john
the
commercial
traveller
added
condescendingly
it
is
cold
weather
for
touring
sir
but
it
a
grand
country
as
ye
say
and
then
they
resumed
their
conversation
the
young
lady
behind
was
far
more
sympathetic
she
made
a
distinct
pause
and
when
she
spoke
again
it
was
with
a
flattering
adoption
of
walter
tone
to
point
out
to
her
companion
how
beautiful
the
scene
was
the
isle
is
floating
too
mysie
look
if
we
could
get
there
soon
enough
we
might
land
upon
one
of
those
rosy
clouds
walter
gave
a
grateful
glance
behind
him
and
felt
that
he
was
understood
that
is
just
your
poetry
miss
oona
said
the
maid
but
bless
me
i
have
never
told
ye
there
has
been
the
light
lighted
in
the
castle
these
two
nights
past
we
have
just
thought
upon
you
all
the
time
and
how
much
taken
up
you
would
be
about
it
your
mamma
and
me
the
light
on
the
castle
cried
the
young
lady
and
at
this
the
coachman
turning
slightly
round
entered
into
the
conversation
that
has
it
he
said
i
can
back
her
up
in
that
just
as
clear
and
as
steady
as
a
star
there
are
many
that
say
they
never
can
see
it
but
they
would
be
clever
that
had
not
seen
it
these
two
past
nights
who
says
they
can
not
see
it
said
the
girl
indignantly
john
gave
a
little
flick
to
his
leader
which
made
the
whole
machine
vibrate
and
roll
persons
of
the
newfangled
kind
that
believe
in
nothing
he
said
they
will
tell
ye
it
can
not
be
so
how
can
you
see
it
though
it
is
glinting
in
their
faces
all
the
time
you
are
meaning
me
john
said
the
traveller
on
the
and
there
truth
in
what
you
say
i
seen
what
you
call
the
light
and
no
doubt
it
has
the
appearance
of
a
light
but
if
ye
tell
me
it
something
supernatural
there
can
be
no
doubt
i
will
answer
ye
that
nothing
supernatural
if
you
were
to
tell
me
ye
had
seen
a
ghost
i
would
just
reply
in
the
same
way
no
my
man
i
not
impeachin
your
veracity
you
saw
something
i
allow
but
no
a
ghost
for
there
are
no
ghosts
to
see
that
just
an
awfu
easy
way
of
settlin
the
question
said
the
maid
from
behind
and
then
she
went
on
in
a
lower
tone
this
will
be
the
third
night
since
it
began
and
we
a
seen
it
on
the
isle
hamish
he
says
the
new
lord
maun
be
of
a
dour
kind
to
need
so
many
warnings
and
he
feared
ill
will
come
of
it
but
i
say
the
new
lord
no
here
away
nor
of
this
country
at
all
how
is
he
to
ken
the
girl
voice
was
now
quite
low
almost
a
whisper
but
walter
being
immediately
in
front
of
her
could
still
hear
has
anything
been
heard
she
said
of
the
new
lord
very
little
miss
oona
only
that
he
a
young
lad
from
the
south
with
no
experience
and
didna
even
know
that
he
was
the
heir
so
how
could
he
ken
as
i
say
to
hamish
but
hamish
he
insists
that
it
in
the
blood
and
that
he
would
ken
by
instinck
and
that
it
shows
an
and
ill
will
come
of
it
if
i
were
he
cried
the
girl
i
would
do
the
same
i
would
not
be
called
like
that
from
the
end
of
the
world
wherever
i
was
oh
whisht
miss
oona
it
is
such
an
auld
auld
story
how
can
the
like
of
you
say
what
should
be
done
i
would
like
myself
said
the
traveller
to
come
to
the
bottom
of
this
business
what
is
it
for
and
who
has
the
doing
of
it
the
moment
you
speak
of
a
light
ye
a
person
that
lights
it
and
mainy
adjuncks
and
accessories
now
there
nobody
or
next
to
nobody
living
in
that
auld
ruin
it
some
rendeyvouss
i
can
easily
understand
that
the
days
of
conspiracies
are
gone
by
or
i
would
say
it
was
something
against
the
state
but
whatever
it
is
it
must
have
a
purpose
and
mortal
hands
must
do
it
seeing
there
are
no
other
i
have
heard
since
ever
i
began
to
travel
this
country
of
the
kinloch
houran
light
but
i
never
heard
a
reason
assigned
it
the
living
lord
cried
the
maid
as
everybody
knows
that
is
called
to
meet
with
here
the
young
lady
interfered
audibly
mysie
not
a
word
the
woman
voice
continued
stifled
as
if
a
hand
had
been
laid
on
her
mouth
with
them
that
are
with
ane
that
is
i
saying
nothing
miss
oona
but
what
all
the
loch
is
well
aware
it
just
a
ferlie
of
this
part
of
the
world
said
john
the
driver
nae
need
of
entering
into
it
with
them
that
believe
naething
i
no
what
ye
call
credulous
mysel
but
when
it
comes
to
the
evidence
of
a
man
ain
senses
and
what
have
your
senses
said
to
ye
my
fine
fellow
that
there
a
queer
kind
of
a
glimmer
up
upon
the
auld
tower
so
are
there
if
i
not
mistaken
seen
by
the
initiated
upon
your
burial
isle
what
do
you
call
it
and
wha
has
a
word
to
say
gainst
that
cried
the
driver
angrily
whilst
mysie
behind
murmured
it
well
seen
ye
have
naething
to
do
with
any
grave
there
now
walter
was
as
entirely
free
from
superstition
as
any
young
man
need
be
but
when
he
heard
the
laugh
with
which
the
sceptic
greeted
these
protests
he
had
the
greatest
mind
in
the
world
to
seize
him
by
the
collar
and
pitch
him
into
the
bog
below
why
but
the
impulse
was
quite
unreasonable
and
defied
explanation
he
had
as
little
faith
in
as
any
bagman
ever
had
and
the
embarrassed
and
uneasy
consciousness
he
had
that
the
end
of
his
journey
was
inexplicable
and
its
purpose
ridiculous
led
him
much
more
to
the
conclusion
that
he
was
being
placed
in
a
ludicrous
position
than
that
there
was
anything
solemnly
or
awfully
mysterious
in
it
nevertheless
so
far
from
ranging
himself
upon
the
side
of
the
enlightened
modern
who
took
the
view
of
these
highland
traditions
his
scorn
and
impatience
of
him
was
beyond
words
for
his
own
part
he
had
not
been
sufficiently
to
join
in
the
discussion
but
at
this
moment
he
ventured
a
question
is
this
old
castle
you
speak
of
here
he
paused
not
knowing
how
to
shape
his
inquiry
then
added
uninhabited
for
want
of
anything
better
to
say
not
altogether
said
john
there
is
auld
macalister
and
his
wife
that
live
half
in
the
water
half
out
of
the
water
and
it
the
story
in
the
parish
that
there
are
good
rooms
aye
ready
for
my
lord
but
i
can
tell
ye
naething
about
that
for
i
always
on
the
road
and
i
see
nothing
but
a
wheen
tourists
in
the
summer
that
are
seeking
information
and
have
none
to
give
puir
creatures
there
a
new
lord
just
come
to
the
title
ye
will
maybe
have
met
with
him
if
ye
from
the
south
for
just
an
english
lad
england
my
man
john
is
a
wide
road
said
the
traveller
there
are
too
many
for
us
all
to
know
each
other
as
ye
do
in
a
parish
this
gentleman
will
tell
ye
that
john
satirical
explanation
that
he
had
not
suspected
smith
whose
northern
accent
was
undoubted
of
being
an
englishman
saved
walter
from
any
necessity
of
making
a
reply
and
by
this
time
the
coach
was
rattling
down
upon
a
little
homely
inn
and
which
stood
upon
a
knoll
overlooking
the
loch
and
was
reflected
in
all
its
brightness
of
colour
in
that
mirror
the
ground
shelved
rapidly
down
to
the
and
there
were
several
boats
lying
ready
to
put
out
into
the
loch
one
a
ponderous
ferry
boat
another
a
smaller
but
still
substantial
and
heavy
cobble
in
which
a
man
with
a
red
shirt
and
shaggy
locks
was
standing
up
relieved
against
the
light
walter
jumped
down
hurriedly
with
the
hope
of
being
in
time
to
give
his
hand
to
the
young
lady
who
perhaps
had
divined
his
purpose
for
she
managed
to
alight
on
the
other
side
and
so
balk
him
the
landlady
of
the
little
inn
had
come
out
to
the
door
and
there
was
a
great
sound
of
salutations
and
exclamations
of
welcome
but
i
mustna
keep
you
miss
oona
and
your
mamma
countin
the
moments
and
there
two
or
three
parcels
the
woman
said
the
air
had
begun
to
grow
a
little
brown
as
the
italians
say
that
faint
veil
of
gathering
shade
which
is
still
not
darkness
was
putting
out
by
degrees
the
radiance
of
the
sky
and
as
walter
stood
listening
all
the
mingled
sounds
of
the
arrival
rose
together
in
a
similar
mist
of
sound
through
which
he
sought
for
the
soft
little
accents
of
the
young
lady
voice
amid
the
noises
of
the
unharnessing
the
horses
hoofs
and
ostler
pails
and
louder
tones
presently
he
saw
her
emerge
from
the
group
with
her
maid
laden
with
baskets
and
small
parcels
and
embarking
under
the
conduct
of
the
man
in
the
red
shirt
whom
she
greeted
affectionately
as
hamish
assume
her
place
in
the
stern
and
the
ropes
of
the
rudder
with
evident
use
and
wont
to
watch
her
steer
out
into
the
darkening
loch
into
the
dimness
and
cold
gave
the
young
man
a
vague
sensation
of
pain
it
seemed
to
him
as
if
the
last
possible
link
with
the
human
and
sympathetic
was
detaching
itself
from
him
he
did
not
know
her
indeed
but
it
does
not
take
a
long
time
or
much
personal
knowledge
to
weave
this
mystic
thread
between
one
young
creature
and
another
most
likely
he
thought
she
had
not
so
much
as
noticed
him
but
she
had
come
into
the
dream
of
his
existence
and
touched
his
hand
as
it
were
in
the
vague
atmosphere
which
separates
one
being
from
another
now
he
was
left
with
nothing
around
him
but
the
darkening
landscape
and
the
noisy
little
crowd
about
the
coach
no
one
who
could
give
him
any
fellowship
or
encouragement
in
the
further
contact
which
lay
before
him
with
the
mysterious
and
unknown
after
a
few
moments
the
landlady
came
towards
him
smoothing
down
her
white
apron
which
made
a
great
point
in
the
landscape
so
broad
was
it
and
so
white
she
smiled
upon
him
with
ingratiating
looks
will
you
be
going
north
sir
she
said
or
will
you
be
biding
for
the
night
before
we
dish
up
the
dinner
and
put
the
sheets
on
the
bed
we
like
to
know
who
is
that
young
lady
that
has
just
gone
away
said
walter
not
paying
much
attention
and
where
is
she
going
it
is
late
and
cold
for
the
water
do
you
ever
get
frozen
here
that
is
miss
oona
of
the
isle
said
the
landlady
but
as
i
was
saying
sir
about
the
beds
are
the
islands
inhabited
then
said
walter
and
where
is
kinloch
houran
does
one
go
there
by
water
too
no
mistress
macgregor
said
symington
voice
on
the
other
side
my
lord
will
not
bide
here
i
been
down
to
the
beach
and
there
is
a
boat
there
but
not
your
lordship
own
any
more
than
there
was
a
carriage
waiting
at
baldally
we
must
just
put
our
pride
in
our
pockets
my
lord
and
put
up
with
what
we
can
get
when
your
lordship
ready
we
all
ready
by
this
time
big
john
and
all
the
others
were
standing
in
a
group
staring
at
lord
erradeen
with
all
their
eyes
john
explained
himself
in
a
loud
voice
but
with
an
evident
secret
sense
of
shame
hoo
was
i
to
ken
a
lord
has
nae
business
to
scour
the
country
like
that
like
ony
gangrel
body
sitting
on
the
seat
just
like
the
rest
of
us
smith
and
him
and
me
lord
hoo
was
i
to
ken
if
you
hear
nae
good
of
yourself
it
is
just
your
ain
blame
i
was
thinking
of
no
lord
or
any
such
cattle
i
was
just
thinking
upon
my
beasts
as
for
a
lord
that
gangs
about
like
yon
deceiving
honest
folk
i
wouldna
give
that
for
him
john
said
snapping
his
finger
and
thumb
his
voice
sank
at
the
end
and
the
conclusion
of
the
speech
was
but
half
audible
macgregor
interposing
her
round
soft
intonation
between
the
speaker
and
the
stranger
eh
my
lord
i
just
beg
your
pardon
i
had
no
notion
and
i
hope
your
lordship
found
them
a
civil
big
john
is
certainly
a
little
quick
with
his
tongue
i
hope
you
not
supposing
mistress
macgregor
that
his
lordship
would
fash
himself
about
big
john
said
symington
who
had
now
taken
the
direction
of
affairs
walter
to
tell
the
truth
did
not
feel
much
inclination
to
enter
into
the
discussion
the
gathering
chill
of
the
night
had
got
into
his
inner
man
he
went
down
towards
the
beach
slowly
pondering
taking
every
step
with
a
certain
hesitation
it
seemed
to
him
that
he
stood
on
the
boundary
between
the
even
ground
of
reality
and
some
wild
world
of
fiction
which
he
did
not
comprehend
but
had
a
mingled
terror
and
hatred
of
behind
him
everything
was
homely
and
poor
enough
the
light
streamed
out
of
the
open
doors
and
uncovered
windows
the
red
roof
had
a
subdued
glow
of
cheerfulness
in
the
brown
air
the
sounds
about
were
cheerful
full
of
human
bustle
and
movement
and
mutual
good
offices
the
men
led
the
horses
away
with
a
certain
kindness
the
landlady
with
her
white
apron
stopped
to
say
a
friendly
word
to
big
john
and
interchanged
civilities
with
the
other
humble
passengers
who
were
bringing
her
no
custom
but
merely
passing
her
door
to
the
that
waited
to
take
them
across
the
loch
everywhere
there
was
a
friendly
interchange
a
gleam
of
human
warmth
and
mutual
consolation
but
before
him
lay
the
dark
water
with
a
dark
shadow
of
mingled
towers
and
trees
lying
upon
it
at
some
distance
he
understood
vaguely
that
this
was
kinloch
houran
and
the
sight
of
it
was
not
inviting
he
did
not
know
what
it
might
be
that
should
meet
him
there
but
whatever
it
was
it
repelled
and
revolted
him
he
seemed
to
be
about
to
overpass
some
invisible
boundary
of
truth
and
to
venture
into
the
false
into
regions
in
which
folly
and
trickery
reigned
there
was
in
walter
mind
all
the
sentiment
of
his
century
towards
the
supernatural
he
had
an
angry
disbelief
in
his
mind
not
the
tranquil
contempt
of
the
indifferent
his
annoyed
and
irritated
scorn
perhaps
was
nearer
faith
than
he
supposed
but
he
was
impatient
of
being
called
upon
to
give
any
of
his
attention
to
those
fables
of
the
past
which
imposture
only
could
keep
up
in
the
present
he
felt
that
he
was
going
to
be
made
the
victim
of
some
trick
or
other
the
country
people
evidently
believed
indeed
as
was
natural
enough
to
their
simplicity
but
walter
felt
too
certain
that
he
would
see
the
mechanism
behind
the
most
artful
veil
to
believe
it
possible
that
he
himself
could
be
taken
in
even
for
a
moment
and
he
had
no
desire
to
find
out
the
contemptible
imposture
he
felt
the
whole
business
contemptible
the
secluded
spot
the
falling
night
the
uninhabited
place
were
all
part
of
the
jugglery
should
he
voluntarily
make
himself
a
party
to
it
and
walk
into
the
snare
with
his
eyes
open
he
felt
sure
indeed
that
he
would
remain
with
his
eyes
open
all
the
time
and
was
not
in
the
least
likely
to
submit
to
any
black
art
that
might
be
exercised
upon
him
but
he
paused
and
asked
himself
was
it
consistent
with
the
dignity
of
a
reasonable
creature
a
man
to
allow
himself
to
be
drawn
into
any
degrading
contact
with
this
jugglery
at
all
the
boat
lay
on
the
beach
with
his
baggage
already
in
it
and
symington
standing
respectful
awaiting
his
master
pleasure
symington
no
doubt
was
the
god
out
of
the
machinery
who
had
the
of
everything
and
all
the
strings
in
his
hand
what
if
he
broke
the
spell
peremptorily
and
retired
to
the
ruddy
fireside
of
the
inn
and
defied
family
tradition
he
asked
himself
again
what
would
come
of
it
and
replied
to
himself
scornfully
that
nothing
could
come
of
it
what
law
could
force
him
to
observe
an
antiquated
superstition
it
was
folly
to
threaten
him
with
impossible
penalties
and
even
if
a
thing
so
absurd
could
happen
as
that
he
should
be
punished
in
purse
or
property
for
acting
like
a
man
of
sense
instead
of
a
fool
what
then
the
mere
possibility
of
the
risk
made
walter
more
disposed
to
incur
it
it
was
monstrous
and
insufferable
that
he
should
be
made
to
carry
out
a
tyrannical
antiquated
stipulation
by
any
penalty
of
the
law
it
would
be
better
to
fight
it
out
once
for
all
all
the
sense
of
the
kingdom
would
be
with
him
and
he
did
not
believe
that
any
judge
could
pronounce
against
him
here
symington
called
with
a
slight
tone
of
anxiety
we
are
all
ready
my
lord
and
waiting
this
almost
decided
walter
he
turned
from
the
beach
and
made
a
few
hasty
steps
up
the
slope
but
then
he
paused
again
and
turning
round
faced
once
more
the
darkening
water
the
boat
lying
like
a
shadow
upon
the
beach
the
vague
figures
of
the
men
about
it
the
had
pushed
off
and
was
lumbering
over
the
water
with
great
oars
going
like
bats
wings
and
a
noisy
human
load
the
other
little
vessel
with
that
girl
had
almost
disappeared
he
thought
he
could
see
in
the
darkness
a
white
speck
like
a
bird
which
was
the
white
shawl
that
wrapped
her
throat
and
shoulders
her
home
lay
somewhere
in
the
centre
of
these
dark
waters
a
curious
nest
for
such
a
creature
and
his
he
turned
again
towards
the
dark
towers
and
gables
some
of
them
were
so
irregular
in
outline
that
they
could
be
nothing
but
ruins
he
began
to
think
of
the
past
mute
out
of
date
harmless
to
affect
the
life
that
had
replaced
it
which
had
taken
refuge
there
and
he
remembered
his
own
argument
about
the
courtesy
that
the
living
owed
to
the
dead
well
if
it
was
so
if
it
was
as
a
politeness
a
courtesy
to
the
past
it
might
be
unworthy
a
gentleman
to
refuse
it
and
perhaps
when
all
was
said
it
was
just
a
little
cowardly
to
turn
one
back
upon
a
possible
danger
upon
what
at
least
the
vulgar
thought
a
danger
this
decided
him
he
turned
once
more
and
with
a
few
rapid
steps
reached
the
boat
next
moment
they
were
afloat
upon
the
dark
loch
there
had
been
no
wind
to
speak
of
on
shore
but
the
boat
was
soon
struggling
against
a
strong
running
current
and
a
breeze
which
was
like
ice
the
boatmen
showed
dark
against
the
gleaming
loch
the
rude
little
vessel
rolled
the
wind
blew
in
front
of
them
rose
the
dark
towers
and
woods
all
black
without
a
sign
of
human
habitation
walter
felt
his
heart
rise
at
last
with
the
sense
of
adventure
it
was
the
strangest
way
of
entering
upon
a
fine
inheritance
chapter
kinloch
houran
castle
stands
out
of
the
very
waters
of
loch
houran
with
its
ruined
gables
and
towers
clothed
with
ivy
from
the
water
it
looked
like
nothing
but
a
roofless
and
deserted
ruin
one
tower
in
the
centre
stood
up
above
the
jagged
lines
of
the
walls
with
something
that
looked
like
a
ruined
balcony
or
terrace
commanding
the
landscape
the
outline
was
indistinct
for
the
trees
that
had
got
footing
in
the
ruined
chambers
below
grew
high
and
wild
veiling
the
means
by
which
it
was
sustained
at
that
altitude
but
the
little
platform
itself
was
very
visible
surrounding
the
solid
block
of
the
tower
which
showed
no
window
or
opening
but
looked
as
if
it
might
yet
outlive
centuries
as
the
boat
approached
walter
saw
the
rowers
whisper
and
give
significant
looks
at
symington
who
sat
respectfully
on
one
of
the
cross
seats
not
to
put
himself
in
the
way
of
his
master
who
occupied
the
other
alone
hoarse
whispers
breathed
about
the
other
end
of
the
boat
and
symington
was
progged
in
the
shoulders
with
an
occasional
oar
will
ye
no
be
letting
him
the
rowers
said
walter
faculties
were
eagerly
acute
in
the
strangeness
of
everything
around
him
the
sense
that
he
was
going
to
an
impossible
house
to
a
ruin
on
an
impossible
errand
seemed
to
keep
him
on
the
alert
in
every
particular
of
his
being
he
could
see
through
the
dusk
he
could
hear
through
the
whistle
of
the
wind
and
the
lashing
of
the
water
upon
the
boat
side
which
was
like
the
roar
of
a
mimic
storm
and
he
was
not
even
insensible
to
the
comic
element
in
symington
face
who
waved
away
the
oar
with
which
he
was
poked
and
replied
with
words
and
frowns
and
looks
full
of
such
superiority
of
information
that
a
burst
of
sudden
nervous
laughter
at
the
sight
relieved
walter
excitement
he
felt
that
a
thrill
of
disapproval
at
this
went
through
the
boat
and
the
men
in
the
bow
shook
their
bonnets
as
they
rowed
it
nothing
to
laugh
at
my
lord
said
old
symington
though
i
not
one
and
i
make
no
question
but
your
lordship
is
not
one
to
lose
my
presence
o
mind
yon
the
phenomenon
that
they
wanted
me
to
call
your
lordship
attention
to
he
added
jerking
his
arm
but
without
turning
his
head
in
the
direction
of
the
tower
the
light
walter
said
he
had
been
about
to
ask
what
the
meaning
of
it
might
be
it
had
not
been
visible
at
all
when
they
started
but
for
the
last
moment
or
two
had
been
growing
steadily
the
daylight
was
waning
every
minute
and
no
doubt
he
thought
it
was
this
that
made
the
light
more
evident
it
shone
from
the
balcony
or
high
which
surrounded
the
old
tower
it
was
difficult
to
distinguish
what
it
was
or
identify
any
lamp
or
beacon
as
the
origin
of
it
it
seemed
to
come
from
the
terrace
generally
a
soft
extended
light
with
nothing
fiery
in
it
no
appearance
of
any
blaze
or
burning
but
a
motionless
clear
shining
which
threw
a
strange
glimmer
upwards
upon
the
solid
mass
of
the
tower
and
downwards
upon
the
foliage
which
was
black
and
glistening
and
upon
the
surface
of
the
water
yon
the
phenomenon
said
symington
pointing
with
a
jerk
of
his
elbow
the
light
brought
out
the
whole
mass
of
rugged
masonry
and
trees
from
the
rest
of
the
landscape
and
softly
defined
it
against
the
darker
background
how
is
it
done
said
the
young
man
simply
he
perceived
the
moment
after
that
his
tone
was
like
that
of
the
bagman
on
the
coach
and
shivered
at
the
thought
so
soft
and
steady
was
the
light
that
it
had
not
seemed
to
him
extraordinary
at
all
what
do
you
mean
by
a
phenomenon
he
asked
hastily
he
remembered
suddenly
that
the
young
lady
on
the
coach
had
spoken
of
this
light
and
taken
it
so
to
speak
under
her
protection
if
your
lordship
has
ainy
desire
to
inquire
into
my
opinion
said
old
symington
though
i
doubt
that
little
likely
i
would
say
it
was
just
intended
to
work
on
the
imagination
now
and
then
indeed
it
useful
in
the
way
of
a
sign
like
a
person
waving
to
you
to
come
and
speak
but
to
work
on
the
imagination
that
what
i
would
say
walter
looked
up
at
the
light
which
threw
a
faint
glimmer
across
the
dark
water
showing
the
blackness
of
the
roughened
ripple
over
which
they
were
making
their
way
and
bringing
into
curious
prominence
the
dark
mass
of
the
building
rising
out
of
it
it
was
not
like
the
moon
it
was
more
distinct
than
starlight
it
was
paler
than
a
torch
nor
was
there
any
apparent
central
point
from
which
it
came
there
was
no
electric
light
in
those
days
nor
was
loch
houran
a
probable
spot
for
its
introduction
but
the
clear
colourless
light
was
of
that
description
it
filled
the
visitor
with
a
vague
curiosity
but
nothing
more
to
work
on
whose
imagination
and
with
what
object
he
said
but
as
he
asked
the
question
the
boat
shot
forward
into
the
narrow
part
of
the
loch
and
rounded
the
corner
of
the
ruin
anything
more
hopeless
as
a
place
to
which
living
passengers
with
the
usual
encumbrances
of
luggage
were
going
could
not
well
be
conceived
but
after
a
few
minutes
rowing
the
boat
ran
in
to
some
rude
steps
on
the
other
side
of
the
castle
where
there
were
traces
of
a
path
leading
up
across
the
rough
grass
to
a
partially
visible
door
all
was
so
dark
by
this
time
that
it
was
with
difficulty
that
walter
found
the
landing
when
he
had
got
ashore
and
his
portmanteau
had
been
put
out
on
the
bank
the
men
in
the
boat
pushed
off
with
an
energy
and
readiness
which
proved
their
satisfaction
in
getting
clear
of
the
castle
and
its
traditions
to
find
himself
left
there
with
an
apparently
ruined
house
behind
him
his
property
at
his
feet
his
old
servant
by
his
side
night
closing
in
around
and
the
dark
glistening
water
lapping
up
on
the
stones
at
his
feet
was
about
as
forlorn
a
situation
as
could
be
imagined
are
we
to
pass
the
night
here
he
said
in
a
voice
which
could
not
help
being
somewhat
querulous
the
sound
of
a
door
opening
behind
interrupted
his
words
and
turning
round
he
saw
an
old
man
standing
in
the
doorway
with
a
small
lamp
in
his
hand
he
held
it
up
high
over
his
head
to
see
who
the
were
and
walter
looking
round
saw
a
bowed
and
aged
figure
a
pale
old
face
which
might
have
been
made
out
of
ivory
so
bloodless
was
it
the
forehead
polished
and
shining
some
grey
locks
escaping
at
the
side
of
a
black
and
eyes
looking
out
keenly
into
the
darkness
it
is
just
his
lordship
macalister
said
old
symington
the
young
man
who
was
so
strange
to
it
all
stood
with
a
sort
of
helplessness
between
the
two
old
men
who
were
familiar
with
each
other
and
the
place
and
all
its
customs
come
away
then
come
away
cried
the
guardian
of
the
house
with
a
shrill
voice
that
penetrated
the
stillness
sharply
what
are
ye
biding
there
for
in
the
dark
and
who
to
carry
up
my
lord
portmanteau
said
symington
his
portmanteau
cried
the
other
with
a
sort
of
eldritch
laugh
has
he
come
to
bide
this
colloquy
held
over
him
exasperated
walter
and
he
seized
the
portmanteau
hastily
forgetting
his
dignity
lend
a
hand
symington
and
let
us
have
no
more
talk
he
said
there
is
a
moment
when
the
most
forlorn
sensations
and
the
most
dismal
circumstances
become
either
ludicrous
or
irritating
the
young
man
shook
off
his
sense
of
oppression
and
repugnance
as
he
hastened
up
the
slope
to
the
door
while
the
lantern
flashing
fitfully
about
showed
now
the
broken
path
now
the
rough
red
masonry
of
the
ruin
which
was
scarcely
less
unlike
a
ruin
on
this
side
than
on
the
other
the
door
gave
admittance
into
a
narrow
passage
only
out
of
which
a
spiral
staircase
ascended
close
to
the
entrance
the
passage
itself
apparently
leading
away
into
the
darkness
to
a
considerable
distance
at
the
end
of
it
stood
a
woman
with
a
lighted
candle
peering
out
at
the
stranger
as
the
man
had
done
he
seemed
to
realise
the
stones
which
every
one
has
read
of
a
belated
traveller
unwillingly
received
into
some
desolate
inn
which
turns
out
to
be
the
headquarters
of
a
and
where
the
intruder
must
be
murdered
ere
the
morning
this
is
your
way
my
lord
said
the
shrill
old
man
leading
the
way
up
the
spiral
stair
the
whole
scene
was
like
a
picture
the
woman
holding
up
her
light
at
the
end
of
the
long
passage
the
old
man
with
his
lamp
the
dark
corners
full
of
silence
and
mystery
the
cold
wind
blowing
as
through
an
icy
ravine
and
the
sensations
of
the
young
man
who
had
not
even
had
those
experiences
of
adventure
which
most
young
men
have
in
these
travelling
days
whom
poverty
and
idleness
had
kept
at
home
in
tame
domestic
comfort
were
very
strange
and
novel
he
seemed
to
himself
to
be
walking
into
a
romance
not
into
any
real
place
but
into
some
old
storybook
a
mystery
of
udolpho
an
antiquated
and
conventional
region
of
gloom
and
artificial
alarms
come
this
way
my
lord
come
this
way
said
the
old
man
the
steps
are
a
bit
worn
for
they
auld
auld
as
auld
as
the
house
but
we
hope
you
find
everything
as
comfortable
as
the
circumstances
will
permit
we
have
had
just
twa
three
days
to
prepare
my
mistress
and
me
but
we
done
our
best
as
far
he
added
as
the
circumstances
will
permit
this
way
this
way
my
lord
at
the
head
of
the
stair
everything
was
black
as
night
the
old
lamp
threw
his
own
somewhat
fantastic
shadow
upon
the
wall
of
a
narrow
corridor
as
he
held
it
up
to
guide
the
close
to
the
top
of
the
staircase
however
there
opened
a
door
through
which
a
warm
light
was
showing
and
walter
to
his
surprise
found
himself
in
a
room
with
a
cheerful
fire
and
a
table
covered
for
dinner
a
welcome
end
to
the
discomfort
and
gloom
of
the
arrival
the
room
was
low
but
large
and
there
were
candles
on
the
mantelpiece
and
table
which
made
a
sort
of
twinkling
illumination
in
the
midst
of
the
dark
panelled
walls
and
dark
furniture
the
room
was
lined
with
books
at
one
end
it
was
furnished
with
comfortable
sofas
and
chairs
of
modern
manufacture
there
was
a
curious
dim
mirror
over
the
mantelshelf
in
a
heavy
gilt
frame
of
old
carving
one
or
two
dim
old
portraits
hung
opposite
the
curtains
were
drawn
the
fire
was
bright
the
white
tablecloth
with
an
silver
vase
in
the
middle
and
the
candles
burning
made
a
cheerful
centre
of
light
at
the
further
end
was
another
door
open
which
admitted
to
a
dim
but
comfortable
in
the
firelight
all
this
was
encouraging
walter
threw
himself
into
a
chair
with
a
sense
that
the
situation
altogether
was
improving
things
can
not
be
so
very
bad
when
there
is
a
fire
and
lights
and
a
prospect
of
dinner
he
began
to
laugh
at
himself
when
he
had
taken
off
his
coat
and
felt
the
warmth
of
the
glowing
fire
everything
around
him
was
adapted
for
comfort
there
was
a
little
want
of
light
which
left
all
the
corners
mysterious
and
showed
the
portraits
dimly
like
spectators
looking
down
from
the
wall
but
the
comfortable
was
much
more
present
than
the
weird
and
uncanny
which
had
so
much
predominated
on
his
arrival
and
when
a
dinner
which
was
very
good
and
carefully
cooked
and
a
bottle
of
wine
which
though
he
had
not
very
much
skill
in
that
subject
walter
knew
to
be
costly
and
fine
had
been
served
with
noiseless
care
by
symington
the
young
man
began
to
recover
his
spirits
and
to
think
of
the
tradition
which
required
his
presence
here
as
silly
indeed
but
without
harm
after
dinner
he
seated
himself
by
the
fire
to
think
over
the
whole
matter
it
was
not
yet
a
fortnight
since
this
momentous
change
had
happened
in
his
life
before
that
he
had
been
without
importance
without
use
in
the
world
with
little
hope
with
nothing
he
cared
for
sufficiently
to
induce
him
to
exert
himself
one
way
or
another
now
after
he
had
passed
this
curious
probation
whatever
it
was
what
a
life
opened
before
him
he
did
not
even
know
how
important
it
was
how
much
worth
living
it
shone
before
him
indistinctly
as
a
sort
of
vague
general
realisation
of
all
dreams
wealth
that
was
the
least
of
it
power
to
do
whatever
he
pleased
to
affect
other
lives
to
choose
for
himself
almost
whatever
pleased
him
he
thought
of
parliament
even
of
government
in
his
ignorance
he
thought
of
travel
he
thought
of
great
houses
full
of
gaiety
and
life
it
was
not
as
yet
sufficiently
realised
to
make
him
decide
on
one
thing
or
another
he
preferred
it
as
it
was
vague
an
indefinite
mass
of
good
things
and
glories
to
come
only
this
ordeal
or
whatever
it
was
those
few
days
more
or
less
that
he
was
bound
to
remain
at
kinloch
houran
stood
between
him
and
his
magnificent
career
and
after
all
kinloch
houran
was
nothing
very
terrible
it
might
be
like
the
mysteries
of
udolpho
outside
but
all
the
mysteries
of
udolpho
turned
out
he
remembered
quite
explainable
and
not
so
very
alarming
after
all
and
these
rooms
which
bore
the
traces
of
having
been
lived
in
very
lately
and
which
were
quite
adapted
to
be
lived
in
did
not
seem
to
afford
much
scope
for
the
mysterious
there
were
certain
points
indeed
in
which
they
were
defective
a
want
of
air
something
which
occasionally
caught
at
his
respiration
and
gave
him
a
sort
of
choked
and
stifled
sensation
but
that
was
natural
enough
so
carefully
closed
as
everything
was
curtains
drawn
every
draught
warded
off
sometimes
he
had
an
uneasy
feeling
as
if
somebody
had
come
in
behind
him
and
was
hanging
about
the
back
of
his
chair
on
one
occasion
he
even
went
so
far
as
to
ask
sharply
is
it
you
symington
but
looking
back
was
ashamed
of
himself
for
of
course
there
was
nobody
there
he
changed
his
seat
however
so
as
to
face
the
door
and
even
went
the
length
of
opening
it
and
looking
out
to
see
if
there
was
any
one
about
the
little
corridor
seemed
to
ramble
away
into
a
darkness
so
great
that
the
light
of
his
candle
did
no
more
than
touch
its
surface
the
spiral
staircase
looked
like
a
well
of
gloom
this
made
him
shiver
slightly
and
a
to
lock
his
door
came
over
him
of
which
he
felt
ashamed
as
he
turned
back
into
the
cheerful
light
after
all
it
was
nothing
but
the
sensation
of
loneliness
which
made
this
impression
he
went
back
to
his
chair
and
once
more
resumed
his
thoughts
or
rather
was
it
not
his
thoughts
nay
his
fancies
that
resumed
him
and
fluttered
about
and
around
presenting
to
him
a
hundred
swiftly
changing
scenes
he
saw
visions
of
his
old
life
detached
scenes
which
came
suddenly
up
through
the
darkness
and
presented
themselves
before
him
a
bit
of
sloebury
high
street
with
a
group
of
his
former
acquaintances
now
so
entirely
separated
from
him
the
little
at
the
cottage
with
julia
herbert
singing
him
a
song
underwood
rooms
on
that
particular
night
when
he
had
gone
in
in
search
of
something
like
excitement
and
had
found
everything
so
dull
and
flat
none
of
these
scenes
had
any
connection
with
his
new
beginning
in
life
they
all
belonged
to
the
past
which
was
so
entirely
past
and
over
but
these
were
the
scenes
which
came
with
a
sort
of
perversity
all
broken
changing
like
badly
managed
views
in
a
magic
lantern
produced
before
him
without
any
will
of
his
there
was
a
sort
of
bewildering
effect
in
the
way
in
which
they
swept
along
one
effacing
another
all
of
them
so
alien
to
the
scene
in
which
he
found
himself
he
had
to
get
up
at
last
shaking
himself
as
free
of
the
curious
whirl
of
unwonted
imagination
as
he
could
no
doubt
his
imagination
was
excited
but
happily
not
he
said
to
himself
by
anything
connected
with
the
present
scene
in
which
he
found
himself
had
it
been
roused
by
these
strange
surroundings
by
the
darkness
and
silence
that
were
about
him
by
the
loneliness
to
which
he
was
so
unused
he
felt
that
there
was
no
telling
what
he
might
see
or
think
he
saw
but
fortunately
it
was
not
in
this
way
that
his
imagination
worked
his
pulse
was
quick
however
his
heart
beating
a
quite
involuntary
excitement
in
all
his
bodily
faculties
he
got
up
hastily
and
went
to
the
bookshelves
where
he
found
to
his
surprise
a
large
collection
of
novels
and
light
literature
it
seemed
to
walter
that
his
predecessor
whom
he
had
never
seen
the
former
lord
erradeen
who
inhabited
these
rooms
not
very
long
ago
had
been
probably
like
himself
anxious
to
quench
the
rising
of
his
fancy
in
the
less
exciting
course
of
a
fictitious
drama
the
conventional
excitements
of
a
story
he
looked
over
the
shelves
with
a
curious
sympathy
for
this
unknown
person
whom
indeed
he
had
never
thought
much
upon
before
did
that
unknown
know
who
was
to
succeed
him
did
he
ever
speculate
upon
walter
as
walter
was
now
doing
upon
him
he
turned
over
the
books
with
a
strange
sense
of
examining
the
secrets
of
his
predecessor
mind
they
were
almost
all
books
of
adventure
and
excitement
he
took
down
after
a
moment
a
volume
of
dumas
and
returned
to
his
by
the
fire
to
lose
himself
in
the
breathless
ride
of
and
the
luckless
fortunes
of
the
three
companions
it
answered
the
purpose
admirably
a
sudden
lull
came
over
his
restless
fancy
he
was
in
great
comfort
externally
warmed
and
fed
and
reposing
after
a
somewhat
weary
day
and
the
spell
of
the
great
got
hold
of
him
he
was
startled
out
of
this
equable
calm
when
symington
came
in
to
light
the
candles
in
his
and
bring
hot
water
and
offer
his
services
generally
symington
regarded
him
with
an
approval
which
he
did
not
think
it
worth
his
while
to
dissemble
that
right
my
lord
that
right
he
said
reading
a
very
fine
thing
when
you
have
too
much
to
occupy
your
thoughts
walter
was
amused
by
this
deliverance
and
happily
not
impatient
of
it
that
is
a
new
reason
for
reading
he
said
but
it
is
a
real
just
one
if
your
lordship
will
permit
me
to
say
so
keep
you
to
your
book
my
lord
it
just
fine
for
putting
other
things
out
of
your
head
it
dumas
you
reading
i
tried
that
french
fellow
myself
but
i
can
not
say
that
i
made
head
or
tail
of
him
he
would
have
it
that
all
that
has
happened
in
history
was
just
at
the
mercy
of
a
wheen
adventurers
two
or
three
vagrants
of
frenchmen
no
no
i
may
believe
a
great
deal
but
i
not
likely
to
believe
that
i
see
you
are
a
critic
symington
and
do
you
read
for
the
same
reason
that
you
have
been
suggesting
to
me
because
you
have
too
much
to
occupy
your
thoughts
well
pairtly
my
lord
and
pairtly
just
in
my
idle
hours
to
pass
the
time
i
have
made
up
your
fire
and
lighted
the
candles
and
everything
is
in
order
will
i
wait
upon
your
lordship
till
you
inclined
for
your
bed
or
will
i
symington
made
a
significant
pause
which
it
was
not
very
difficult
to
interpret
you
need
not
wait
walter
said
and
then
with
an
instinct
which
he
was
half
ashamed
of
he
asked
hurriedly
whereabouts
do
you
sleep
that
is
just
about
the
difficulty
said
old
symington
i
rather
out
of
call
if
your
lordship
should
want
anything
the
only
way
will
just
be
to
come
down
the
stairs
if
your
lordship
will
take
the
trouble
and
ring
the
big
bell
it
would
waken
a
the
seven
sleepers
if
it
was
rung
at
their
lug
and
i
not
so
ill
to
waken
when
there
is
noise
enough
but
ye
have
everything
to
your
hand
my
lord
if
you
just
give
a
glance
into
the
other
room
i
can
let
you
see
where
everything
is
there
is
the
not
to
say
a
small
kettle
by
the
fire
and
there
that
will
do
said
walter
i
shall
not
want
anything
more
the
old
servant
went
away
with
a
glance
round
the
room
in
which
walter
thought
there
was
some
anxiety
and
stopped
again
at
the
door
to
say
good
night
my
lord
it
not
that
i
am
keen
for
my
bed
if
your
lordship
would
like
me
to
bide
or
even
to
take
a
doze
upon
a
chair
go
to
bed
old
said
the
young
man
with
a
laugh
the
idea
of
finding
a
protector
in
symington
was
somewhat
ludicrous
but
these
interruptions
disturbed
him
once
more
and
brought
back
his
excitement
he
felt
a
sort
of
pang
as
he
heard
the
old
servant
heavy
step
going
down
the
winding
stair
and
echoing
far
away
as
it
seemed
into
the
bowels
of
the
earth
then
that
extreme
and
blighting
silence
which
is
like
a
sort
of
conscious
death
came
upon
the
place
the
thick
curtains
shut
out
every
sound
of
wind
and
water
outside
as
they
shut
out
every
glimpse
of
light
walter
heard
his
pulse
in
his
ears
his
heart
thumping
like
the
hammer
of
a
machine
the
whole
universe
seemed
concentrated
in
that
only
living
breathing
thing
which
was
himself
he
tried
to
resume
his
book
but
the
spell
of
the
story
was
broken
he
could
no
longer
follow
the
fortunes
of
athos
porthos
and
aramis
walter
methven
thrust
himself
in
front
of
these
personages
and
though
he
was
not
half
so
amusing
claimed
a
superior
importance
by
right
of
those
pulses
that
clanged
in
his
head
like
drums
beating
he
said
to
himself
that
he
was
very
comfortable
that
he
had
never
expected
to
be
so
well
off
but
he
could
not
regain
his
composure
or
sense
of
it
was
a
little
better
when
he
went
into
his
the
mere
movement
and
passage
from
one
room
to
another
being
of
use
to
him
the
sense
of
oppression
and
stagnation
however
soon
became
almost
greater
here
than
in
the
one
side
of
the
room
was
entirely
draped
in
curtains
so
that
it
was
impossible
to
make
out
even
where
the
windows
were
he
drew
them
aside
with
some
trouble
for
the
draperies
were
very
heavy
but
not
to
much
advantage
at
first
it
seemed
to
him
that
there
were
no
windows
at
all
then
he
caught
sight
of
something
like
a
recess
high
in
the
wall
and
climbing
up
found
the
hasp
of
a
rough
shutter
which
covered
a
small
square
window
built
into
a
cave
of
the
deep
masonry
that
this
should
be
the
only
means
of
lighting
an
almost
luxurious
sleeping
chamber
bewildered
him
more
and
more
but
it
would
not
open
and
let
in
no
air
and
the
atmosphere
felt
more
stifling
than
ever
in
this
revelation
of
the
impossibility
of
renewing
it
finally
he
went
to
bed
with
a
sort
of
rueful
sense
that
there
was
the
last
citadel
and
refuge
of
a
stranger
beset
by
imaginations
in
so
weird
and
mysterious
a
place
he
did
not
expect
to
sleep
but
he
determined
that
he
would
not
at
least
be
the
sport
of
his
own
fancies
it
astonished
walter
beyond
measure
to
find
himself
waking
in
broad
daylight
with
symington
moving
softly
about
the
room
and
a
long
window
the
existence
of
which
he
had
never
suspected
facing
him
as
he
looked
up
from
his
pillows
after
a
comfortable
night
sleep
mingled
shame
and
amusement
made
him
burst
into
an
uneasy
laugh
as
he
realised
this
exceedingly
easy
end
of
his
tribulations
macalister
said
symington
would
like
well
to
know
when
your
lordship
is
likely
to
be
ready
to
put
down
the
trout
at
the
right
moment
for
it
an
awful
pity
to
spoil
a
loch
houran
trout
chapter
xi
to
insist
upon
the
difference
between
an
impression
made
when
we
arrive
tired
and
excited
at
night
in
a
strange
place
and
that
which
the
same
scene
produces
in
the
early
freshness
and
new
life
of
the
morning
would
be
to
deliver
ourselves
over
to
the
reign
of
the
truism
it
would
however
have
been
impossible
to
feel
this
with
more
force
than
walter
felt
it
his
sensations
of
alarm
and
excitement
struck
him
not
only
as
unjustifiable
but
ludicrous
he
laughed
once
more
when
he
came
out
of
his
chamber
into
the
warm
and
genial
room
which
had
seemed
to
him
so
mysterious
and
dark
on
the
previous
night
there
were
windows
upon
either
side
of
the
each
in
a
deep
recess
like
a
small
room
so
great
was
the
thickness
of
the
wall
they
looked
out
upon
the
mountains
upon
the
narrow
end
of
the
loch
all
bubbling
and
sparkling
in
the
sunshine
and
down
upon
the
little
grassy
slope
rough
and
uncared
for
yet
green
which
was
the
only
practicable
entrance
to
the
castle
the
windows
were
not
large
and
the
room
still
not
very
light
though
the
sunshine
which
poured
in
at
one
side
made
a
most
picturesque
effect
of
light
and
shade
the
portraits
on
the
wall
were
better
than
they
had
seemed
and
had
lost
the
inquisitive
air
of
dissatisfied
inspection
which
walter
imagination
had
given
them
the
at
the
end
gave
relief
to
the
room
with
their
cheerful
gilding
and
the
subdued
tone
of
their
bindings
walter
thought
of
the
chamber
in
the
turned
towards
the
sunrising
the
name
of
which
was
peace
but
peace
was
not
the
thing
most
suggested
at
kinloch
houran
by
any
of
the
accessories
about
and
a
vision
of
the
chilliness
of
the
gray
light
in
the
afternoon
and
the
force
of
the
east
wind
when
it
came
crossed
his
mind
in
true
nineteenth
century
criticism
of
the
more
poetical
view
but
in
the
mean
time
the
policy
of
enjoying
the
present
was
undeniable
especially
when
that
present
took
the
form
of
a
loch
houran
trout
fresh
from
the
water
and
cooked
as
fish
only
are
under
such
conditions
he
looked
back
upon
the
agitations
of
the
evening
and
the
reluctant
angry
sentiment
with
which
he
had
come
to
this
old
house
of
his
family
with
amused
incredulity
and
shame
to
think
that
he
could
be
such
an
impressionable
fool
he
dismissed
it
all
lightly
from
his
mind
as
he
hurried
over
his
breakfast
with
the
intention
of
getting
out
at
once
and
exploring
everything
about
he
had
even
newspapers
upon
his
table
along
with
the
fresh
scones
the
butter
all
the
fresh
provisions
of
the
meal
to
be
sure
it
was
glasgow
and
not
london
from
which
they
came
but
the
world
history
was
no
less
instant
in
them
flashing
from
all
parts
of
the
world
into
this
home
of
the
ancient
ages
his
first
inspection
was
of
the
castle
itself
which
he
undertook
under
the
auspices
of
old
symington
and
old
macalister
both
eager
to
explain
and
describe
what
it
had
been
as
well
as
what
it
was
what
it
was
did
not
consist
of
very
much
my
lord
rooms
those
in
which
he
had
spent
the
night
were
the
only
habitable
portion
of
the
great
pile
he
was
led
through
the
roofless
hall
with
its
musicians
gallery
still
perched
high
up
and
overshadowed
with
canopies
of
ashen
boughs
vigorous
though
leafless
the
the
supposed
kitchen
with
its
large
chimney
the
oblong
space
from
east
to
west
which
was
supposed
to
have
been
the
chapel
all
was
a
little
incoherent
in
the
completeness
of
ruin
there
was
little
of
the
stimulation
of
family
pride
to
be
got
out
of
those
desolate
places
the
destruction
was
too
complete
to
leave
room
even
for
the
facile
web
of
imagination
the
crusader
about
whom
there
was
a
legend
a
little
too
picturesque
and
romantic
to
be
true
or
the
lady
who
was
only
saved
by
his
sudden
appearance
from
unfaithfulness
were
not
more
easy
to
conjure
up
within
the
inclosure
of
those
shapeless
walls
than
on
any
unremarkable
spot
where
the
story
might
have
been
told
walter
grew
a
little
weary
as
symington
and
the
old
guardian
of
the
house
argued
as
to
which
was
this
division
of
the
castle
and
which
that
he
left
them
discussing
the
question
and
climbed
up
by
a
rude
stair
which
had
been
half
improvised
from
the
ruined
projections
of
the
masonry
to
the
crumbling
battlements
above
from
thence
he
looked
down
upon
a
scene
which
was
older
than
the
oldest
ruin
yet
ever
fresh
in
perennial
youth
the
loch
stretched
out
like
a
great
mirror
under
the
wintry
blue
of
the
sky
and
the
dazzling
blaze
of
the
sunshine
reflecting
everything
every
speck
of
cloud
above
and
every
feathery
twig
and
minute
island
below
there
was
no
need
to
make
believe
to
simulate
unfelt
enthusiasm
or
endeavour
to
connect
with
unreal
associations
this
wonderful
and
glorious
scene
perhaps
there
was
in
his
mind
something
more
in
harmony
with
the
radiance
of
nature
than
with
the
broken
fragments
of
a
history
which
he
had
no
skill
to
piece
up
into
life
again
he
stood
gazing
upon
the
scene
in
a
rapture
of
silent
delight
the
hills
in
their
robes
of
velvet
softness
ethereal
more
lovely
than
any
tissue
ever
woven
in
mortal
loom
drew
aside
on
either
hand
in
the
blue
space
and
dazzling
atmosphere
to
open
out
this
liquid
vale
of
light
with
its
dark
specks
of
islets
its
feathery
banks
all
rustling
with
leafless
trees
every
outline
and
detail
within
its
reach
was
turned
into
a
line
a
touch
more
sweet
by
the
flattering
glory
of
the
still
water
in
which
everything
was
double
the
morning
freshness
and
sheen
were
still
unbroken
it
was
like
a
new
creation
lying
contemplating
itself
in
the
first
ecstasy
of
consciousness
walter
was
gazing
upon
this
wonderful
scene
when
the
sharp
voice
of
old
macalister
made
him
start
and
take
a
step
aside
which
almost
had
serious
consequences
for
he
stepped
back
unwarily
upon
the
crumbling
wall
and
might
have
fallen
but
for
the
violent
grip
of
the
old
man
who
clutched
him
like
a
shaky
hercules
with
a
grasp
which
was
vigorous
yet
trembling
lord
sake
take
care
he
cried
his
face
flushed
then
paled
again
with
genuine
emotion
do
you
think
we
have
a
store
of
young
lads
like
you
that
you
will
risk
your
life
like
yon
and
just
in
the
place
where
the
lady
fell
you
have
given
me
such
a
start
i
canna
breathe
he
cried
to
tell
the
truth
looking
back
upon
it
walter
himself
did
not
like
the
look
of
the
precipice
which
he
had
escaped
where
the
lady
fell
he
asked
with
a
little
eagerness
as
he
came
to
the
battlement
oh
ay
i
seldom
bother
my
head
about
what
happened
so
to
speak
two
or
three
days
since
it
was
just
there
she
fell
she
has
been
bedridden
ever
since
from
a
i
hear
which
just
shows
the
folly
of
venturing
about
an
auld
place
without
somebody
that
knows
how
to
take
care
of
ye
what
would
have
come
of
you
yoursel
that
is
the
maister
of
a
if
auld
sandy
macalister
had
not
been
there
thank
you
macalister
you
shall
find
me
grateful
said
walter
but
who
was
this
lady
two
or
three
days
ago
did
you
say
years
years
did
i
no
say
years
oh
ay
it
may
be
longer
twenty
or
thirty
i
meaning
just
naething
in
a
life
like
mine
she
had
some
silly
story
of
being
frightened
with
a
gentleman
that
she
thought
she
saw
they
are
keen
about
making
up
a
story
women
folk
she
was
just
the
sister
to
the
man
of
business
ye
have
heard
of
her
a
pretty
bit
thing
if
that
was
of
any
consequence
but
lord
sake
what
that
atween
you
and
me
and
you
ignorant
of
everything
the
old
man
said
do
you
see
the
chimneys
yonder
and
the
gable
end
with
the
crow
steps
as
they
call
it
just
pushing
out
among
the
trees
that
just
your
ain
they
call
it
auchnasheen
i
tell
you
the
meanings
of
the
names
another
time
out
beyond
yonder
the
big
house
away
at
the
point
it
a
new
place
built
for
his
diversion
by
one
of
your
new
men
yon
island
far
away
that
bare
and
green
is
the
island
of
rest
where
all
the
loch
was
once
buried
and
atween
us
and
that
there
another
isle
with
a
gable
end
among
the
trees
which
is
just
the
last
place
that
left
to
an
auld
race
to
plant
their
feet
upon
it
a
bonnie
piece
of
water
you
that
come
from
the
south
you
never
have
seen
the
like
i
tell
you
all
the
stories
of
the
divers
places
and
how
they
connected
with
the
that
are
chiefs
of
loch
houran
for
i
wouldna
give
a
button
for
that
title
of
the
lords
erradeen
it
has
lasted
however
for
some
centuries
said
walter
with
a
sudden
sense
of
displeasure
which
he
felt
to
be
absurd
enough
and
what
is
that
in
a
family
said
old
macalister
i
think
nothing
of
it
a
hundred
years
or
two
that
never
counts
one
way
nor
another
nae
antiquity
if
that
nonsense
were
true
about
the
warlock
lord
he
would
be
but
twa
hundred
and
fifty
at
the
present
speaking
or
thereabouts
and
a
that
have
ever
thought
they
saw
him
represent
him
as
a
fine
personable
man
i
have
never
had
that
pleasure
myself
the
old
man
said
with
his
shrill
laugh
where
are
you
going
my
young
gentleman
ye
just
go
down
like
a
stane
and
end
in
a
rattle
of
dust
and
mortar
if
you
no
be
guided
by
me
let
you
his
lordship
alone
sandy
cried
the
voice
of
symington
intermingled
with
pants
and
sobs
as
he
climbed
up
to
the
parapet
ye
must
not
occupy
my
lord
time
with
your
old
craiks
you
would
perhaps
like
my
lord
to
visit
auchnasheen
where
the
keeper
will
be
on
the
outlook
or
may
be
it
would
be
better
to
organise
your
day
shooting
for
when
you
have
lookit
a
little
about
you
or
ye
would
perhaps
like
to
take
a
look
at
the
environs
or
see
the
factor
who
is
very
anxious
as
soon
as
your
lordship
has
a
moment
oh
and
there
is
the
minister
that
can
tell
ye
a
about
the
antiquities
my
lord
and
traces
out
the
auld
outline
of
the
castle
grandly
till
ye
seem
to
see
it
in
all
its
glory
or
symington
had
begun
when
walter
turned
at
bay
he
faced
the
old
men
with
a
defiance
i
see
plenty
of
boats
about
he
said
i
am
going
out
to
explore
the
loch
i
want
no
attendance
or
any
help
but
that
you
will
be
good
enough
to
leave
me
to
myself
we
do
that
my
lord
i
will
just
run
and
cry
upon
duncan
that
is
waiting
about
the
end
of
all
this
zeal
and
activity
was
that
when
walter
found
himself
at
last
free
and
on
the
shining
bosom
of
the
loch
he
was
in
a
boat
too
heavy
for
his
own
sole
management
sharing
the
care
of
it
with
duncan
who
was
of
a
taciturn
disposition
and
answered
only
when
spoken
to
this
made
the
arrangement
almost
as
satisfactory
as
if
he
had
been
alone
for
duncan
was
quite
willing
to
obey
and
yield
a
hearty
service
without
disturbing
his
young
master
with
either
questions
or
remarks
he
was
a
large
young
man
strong
and
well
knit
though
somewhat
heavy
with
a
broad
smiling
face
red
and
freckled
with
honest
blue
eyes
under
sandy
eyelashes
and
a
profusion
of
strong
and
curly
reddish
hair
he
beamed
upon
lord
erradeen
with
a
sort
of
friendly
admiration
and
awe
answering
ay
my
lord
and
no
my
lord
always
with
the
same
smile
of
general
benevolence
and
readiness
to
comply
with
every
desire
when
they
had
got
beyond
hail
of
the
castle
from
which
symington
and
macalister
watched
them
anxiously
duncan
mutely
suggested
the
elevation
of
a
mast
and
setting
of
the
sail
which
the
vessel
was
furnished
with
to
which
walter
assented
with
eagerness
and
soon
they
were
skimming
along
before
a
light
wind
as
if
they
had
wings
and
now
began
perhaps
the
most
pleasurable
expedition
that
walter
had
ever
made
in
his
life
escaped
from
the
ruinous
old
pile
within
which
he
had
feared
he
knew
not
what
escaped
too
from
the
observation
and
inspection
of
the
two
old
men
so
much
better
acquainted
with
the
history
of
his
family
than
himself
whom
he
felt
to
be
something
between
keepers
and
schoolmasters
fairly
launched
forth
upon
the
world
with
nothing
to
consult
but
his
own
pleasure
walter
felt
his
spirits
rise
to
any
height
of
adventure
there
was
not
indeed
any
very
wild
adventure
probable
but
he
was
not
much
used
to
anything
of
the
kind
and
the
sense
of
freedom
and
freshness
in
everything
was
intoxicating
to
the
young
man
the
small
boat
the
rag
of
a
sail
the
lively
wind
that
drove
them
along
the
rushing
ripple
under
their
keel
all
delighted
him
he
held
the
helm
with
a
sense
of
pleasure
almost
beyond
anything
he
had
ever
known
feeling
all
the
exhilaration
of
a
discoverer
in
a
new
country
and
for
the
first
time
the
master
of
himself
and
his
fate
duncan
said
nothing
but
grinned
from
ear
to
ear
when
the
young
master
in
his
inattention
to
or
to
tell
the
truth
ignorance
of
the
capabilities
of
the
boat
turned
the
helm
sharply
bringing
her
up
to
the
wind
in
such
a
way
as
to
threaten
the
most
summary
end
for
the
voyage
he
kept
his
eye
upon
the
rash
steersman
and
walter
was
not
aware
of
the
risks
he
ran
he
directed
his
little
vessel
now
here
now
there
with
absolute
enjoyment
running
in
close
ashore
to
examine
the
village
turning
about
again
in
a
wild
elation
to
visit
an
island
running
the
very
nose
of
the
boat
into
the
rocky
banks
or
feathery
bushwood
how
it
was
that
no
harm
came
as
they
thus
darted
from
point
to
point
duncan
never
knew
he
stood
up
roused
to
watchfulness
with
his
eyes
intent
on
the
movements
of
his
master
ready
to
remedy
any
indiscretion
it
was
in
the
nature
of
such
undeserved
vigilance
that
the
object
of
it
was
never
aware
of
it
but
to
be
sure
duncan
had
his
own
life
to
think
of
too
they
had
thus
swept
triumphantly
down
the
loch
the
wind
favouring
and
apparently
watching
over
the
rash
voyager
as
carefully
as
and
still
more
disinterestedly
than
duncan
the
motion
the
air
the
restless
career
the
novelty
and
the
freedom
enchanted
walter
he
felt
like
a
boy
in
his
first
escapade
with
an
intoxicating
sense
of
independence
and
scorn
of
danger
which
gave
zest
to
the
independence
at
every
new
zigzag
he
made
duncan
but
grinned
the
more
he
uttered
the
gaelic
name
of
every
point
and
isle
briefly
with
guttural
depth
out
of
his
chest
as
they
went
careering
along
before
the
wind
the
boat
was
like
an
inquisitive
visitor
too
open
for
a
spy
poking
in
to
every
corner
at
length
they
came
to
an
island
standing
high
out
of
the
water
with
a
rocky
beach
upon
which
a
boat
lay
carefully
hauled
up
and
a
feathery
crest
of
trees
fine
clumps
of
fir
fringed
and
surrounded
by
a
luxuriant
growth
of
lighter
wood
in
the
midst
of
this
fine
network
of
branches
such
as
we
call
bare
being
leafless
but
which
in
reality
are
all
astir
with
life
restrained
brown
purple
buddings
eager
to
start
and
held
in
like
hounds
in
a
leash
rose
the
solid
outline
of
a
house
built
upon
the
ridge
of
rock
and
appearing
like
a
shadow
in
the
midst
of
all
the
anatomy
of
the
trees
that
will
be
joost
the
leddy
cried
duncan
at
which
walter
heart
so
light
in
his
bosom
gave
an
additional
leap
of
pleasure
he
steered
it
so
close
that
duncan
vigilance
was
doubly
taxed
for
the
least
neglect
would
have
sent
the
little
vessel
ashore
walter
examined
the
little
landing
the
rocky
path
that
led
up
the
bank
winding
among
the
trees
and
as
much
as
could
be
made
out
of
the
house
with
keen
interest
the
man
with
the
red
shirt
who
had
been
the
young
boatman
on
the
previous
day
appeared
at
the
further
point
as
they
went
on
he
was
fishing
from
a
rock
that
projected
into
the
water
and
turning
to
gaze
upon
the
unwary
boat
with
astonished
eyes
shouted
something
in
gaelic
to
duncan
who
nodded
a
great
many
times
and
replied
with
a
laugh
in
the
same
tongue
yon
will
joost
be
hamish
said
duncan
what
is
he
saying
cried
walter
he
will
just
be
telling
us
to
mind
where
we
are
going
said
duncan
imperturbable
tell
him
to
mind
his
own
business
cried
walter
with
a
laugh
and
who
is
hamish
and
who
is
the
leddy
come
tell
me
all
about
it
his
interest
in
the
voyage
flagged
a
little
at
this
point
duncan
thus
interrogated
was
more
put
to
it
than
by
the
dangerous
course
they
had
hitherto
been
running
it
will
joost
be
the
leddy
he
said
and
hamish
that
her
man
and
they
will
joost
be
living
up
there
like
ither
persons
and
fearing
god
fery
decent
folk
oh
joost
fery
decent
folk
i
never
doubted
that
but
who
are
they
and
what
are
they
and
do
you
mean
to
say
they
there
on
that
rock
in
winter
so
far
north
walter
looked
up
at
the
dazzling
sky
and
repented
his
insinuation
but
he
was
alas
no
better
than
an
englishman
when
all
was
said
and
he
could
not
help
a
slight
shiver
as
he
looked
back
hamish
who
had
made
a
fine
point
of
colour
on
his
projecting
rock
had
gone
from
that
point
and
was
visible
in
his
red
shirt
mounting
the
high
crest
of
the
island
with
hurried
appearances
and
disappearances
as
the
broken
nature
of
the
ground
made
necessary
he
had
gone
there
seemed
little
doubt
to
intimate
to
the
inhabitants
the
appearance
of
the
stranger
this
gave
walter
a
new
thrill
of
pleasure
but
it
took
away
his
eagerness
about
the
scenery
he
lay
back
languidly
neglecting
the
helm
and
as
he
distracted
duncan
attention
too
they
had
nearly
run
aground
on
the
low
beach
of
the
next
island
when
this
difficulty
was
got
over
walter
suddenly
discovered
that
they
had
gone
far
enough
and
might
as
well
be
making
their
way
homeward
which
was
more
easily
said
than
done
for
the
wind
which
had
hitherto
served
their
purpose
nobly
was
no
longer
their
friend
they
made
a
tack
or
two
and
crept
along
a
little
but
afterwards
resigned
themselves
to
ship
the
sail
and
take
to
the
oars
which
was
not
so
exhilarating
nor
so
well
adapted
to
show
the
beauty
of
the
landscape
it
took
them
some
time
to
make
their
way
once
more
past
the
rocky
point
and
along
the
edge
of
the
island
which
attracted
walter
deepest
interest
but
to
which
he
could
not
persuade
duncan
to
give
any
name
it
will
joost
be
the
leddy
the
boatman
insisted
on
saying
with
a
beaming
face
but
either
his
english
or
his
knowledge
was
at
fault
and
he
went
no
further
walter
heart
beat
with
a
kind
of
happy
anxiety
a
keen
but
pleasant
suspense
as
he
swept
his
oar
out
of
the
water
and
glanced
behind
him
to
measure
how
near
they
were
to
the
landing
at
which
he
had
a
presentiment
something
more
interesting
than
hamish
might
be
seen
and
as
it
turned
out
he
had
not
deceived
himself
but
what
he
saw
was
not
what
he
expected
to
see
the
lady
on
the
bank
was
not
his
of
yesterday
she
was
what
walter
to
himself
with
much
disappointment
called
an
old
lady
wrapped
in
a
large
furred
mantle
and
white
fleecy
wrap
about
her
head
and
shoulders
she
stood
and
waved
her
hand
as
walter
boat
came
slowly
within
range
you
will
be
joost
the
leddy
said
duncan
of
the
few
words
and
with
one
great
sweep
of
his
oar
he
turned
the
boat
towards
the
landing
it
was
the
man
doing
not
the
master
but
the
master
was
not
sorry
to
take
advantage
of
this
sudden
guidance
it
was
all
done
in
a
moment
without
intention
hamish
stood
ready
to
secure
the
boat
and
before
he
had
time
to
think
walter
found
himself
on
the
little
clearing
above
the
stony
bit
of
beach
hat
in
hand
glowing
with
surprise
and
pleasure
and
receiving
the
warmest
of
welcomes
you
will
forgive
me
for
just
stopping
you
on
your
way
the
lady
said
but
i
was
fain
to
see
you
lord
erradeen
for
your
father
and
i
were
children
together
i
was
violet
montrose
you
must
have
heard
him
speak
of
me
i
hope
said
walter
with
his
best
bow
and
most
ingratiating
tone
that
you
will
not
consider
it
any
fault
of
mine
but
i
do
remember
my
father
he
died
when
i
was
a
child
dear
me
cried
the
lady
how
could
i
be
so
foolish
looking
at
you
again
i
see
you
would
not
be
old
enough
for
that
and
now
i
remember
he
married
late
and
died
soon
after
well
there
is
no
harm
done
we
are
just
country
neighbours
and
as
i
was
great
friends
with
walter
methven
some
years
ago
i
hope
said
the
young
man
with
a
bow
and
smile
that
you
will
be
so
good
as
to
be
friends
with
walter
methven
now
for
that
is
the
name
under
which
i
know
myself
oh
lord
erradeen
the
lady
said
with
a
little
flutter
of
pleasure
such
a
speech
would
be
pretty
from
any
young
man
but
made
by
a
young
lord
in
all
the
flush
of
his
novel
honours
and
by
far
the
greatest
potentate
of
the
district
there
was
no
one
up
the
loch
or
down
the
loch
who
would
not
have
been
gratified
it
is
just
possible
she
said
after
a
momentary
pause
that
having
been
brought
up
in
england
and
deprived
of
your
father
so
early
you
may
not
know
much
about
your
neighbours
nor
even
who
we
are
in
this
bit
island
of
ours
we
are
the
forresters
of
eaglescairn
whom
no
doubt
ye
have
heard
of
and
i
am
one
of
the
last
of
the
montroses
alas
that
i
should
say
so
i
have
but
one
of
a
large
family
left
with
me
and
oona
and
me
we
have
just
taken
advantage
of
an
old
family
relic
that
came
from
my
side
of
the
house
and
have
taken
up
our
habitation
here
i
hear
she
must
have
travelled
with
you
yesterday
on
the
coach
not
thinking
who
it
was
oh
yes
news
travels
fast
at
this
distance
from
the
world
i
think
the
wind
blows
it
or
the
water
carries
it
all
the
loch
by
this
time
is
aware
of
lord
erradeen
arrival
indeed
she
added
with
a
little
laugh
you
know
my
lord
we
all
saw
the
light
she
was
a
woman
over
fifty
but
fair
and
slight
with
a
willowy
figure
and
a
complexion
of
which
many
a
younger
woman
might
have
been
proud
and
there
was
a
little
airiness
of
gesture
and
tread
about
her
which
probably
thirty
years
before
had
been
the
pretty
affectations
of
a
beauty
and
which
still
kept
up
the
tradition
of
fascinating
powers
the
little
toss
of
her
head
the
gesture
of
her
hands
as
she
said
the
last
words
the
laugh
as
if
excusing
herself
for
a
were
all
characteristic
and
amusing
you
know
she
added
in
the
highlands
we
are
allowed
to
be
superstitious
and
repeated
the
little
laugh
at
herself
with
which
she
deprecated
offence
what
is
it
supposed
to
mean
walter
asked
somewhat
eagerly
of
course
there
is
some
natural
explanation
which
will
be
simple
enough
but
i
prefer
to
take
the
old
explanation
if
i
knew
what
it
was
and
so
do
we
she
said
quickly
we
are
just
ready
to
swear
to
it
man
and
woman
of
us
on
the
loch
some
say
it
is
a
sign
the
head
of
the
house
is
coming
some
that
it
is
a
call
to
him
to
come
and
meet
dear
me
there
is
oona
calling
and
where
is
hamish
i
will
not
have
the
child
kept
waiting
said
the
lady
looking
round
her
with
a
little
nervous
impatience
she
had
begun
to
lead
the
way
upward
by
a
winding
path
among
the
rocks
and
trees
and
now
paused
a
little
breathless
to
look
down
towards
the
and
clap
her
hands
impatiently
hamish
is
away
mem
said
the
woman
whom
walter
had
seen
on
the
coach
and
who
now
met
them
coming
down
the
winding
path
she
looked
at
him
with
a
cordial
smile
and
air
of
kindly
welcome
it
was
evident
that
it
did
not
occur
to
mysie
that
her
salutations
might
be
inappropriate
you
very
welcome
sir
to
your
ain
country
she
said
with
a
courtesy
which
was
polite
rather
than
humble
walter
felt
that
she
would
have
offered
him
her
hand
on
the
smallest
encouragement
with
a
kindly
familiarity
which
conveyed
no
disrespect
you
should
say
my
lord
mysie
her
mistress
remarked
deed
mem
and
so
i
should
but
when
you
no
much
in
the
way
ye
get
confused
i
said
as
soon
as
i
heard
the
news
that
it
would
be
the
young
gentleman
on
the
coach
and
i
had
just
a
feeling
a
the
time
that
it
was
nae
tourist
but
a
kent
face
hamish
is
away
mem
i
tell
him
he
hears
miss
oona
foot
on
the
bank
before
ever
she
cries
upon
him
and
yonder
he
is
just
touching
the
shore
and
her
ready
to
jump
in
the
party
had
reached
a
little
platform
on
the
slope
the
path
was
skilfully
engineered
between
two
banks
clothed
with
ferns
and
grasses
and
still
luxuriant
with
a
vivid
green
though
the
overhanging
trees
were
all
bare
here
and
there
a
little
opening
gave
a
point
of
repose
and
extended
view
forrester
paused
and
turned
round
to
point
out
to
her
visitor
the
prospect
that
now
lay
before
them
she
was
a
little
breathless
and
glad
of
the
pause
but
it
did
not
suit
her
character
to
say
so
she
pointed
round
her
with
a
little
triumph
they
were
high
enough
to
see
the
loch
on
either
side
looking
down
upon
it
through
the
fringe
of
branches
opposite
to
this
was
the
mainland
which
at
that
spot
formed
a
little
bay
thickly
wooded
with
the
dark
green
of
the
fir
woods
amid
which
appeared
the
gables
of
a
sort
of
ornamental
cottage
nearer
the
eye
was
the
road
and
underneath
the
road
on
the
beach
stood
a
little
slight
figure
in
the
garb
which
walter
recognised
she
had
evidently
been
set
down
from
a
waggonette
full
of
a
lively
party
which
waited
on
the
high
road
to
see
her
embark
it
was
impossible
to
hear
what
they
were
saying
but
the
air
was
full
of
a
pleasant
murmur
of
voices
it
is
the
young
campbells
of
ellermore
said
forrester
waving
her
handkerchief
towards
the
group
oona
has
been
spending
last
night
with
them
and
they
have
brought
her
back
they
will
all
be
astonished
mysie
to
see
me
standing
here
with
a
gentleman
dear
me
they
will
all
be
saying
who
has
forrester
got
with
her
they
will
think
said
mysie
just
that
it
james
or
ronald
come
home
ah
mysie
if
that
could
be
said
the
lady
of
the
isle
and
she
put
her
hands
together
which
were
thin
and
white
and
ornamented
by
a
number
of
rings
with
a
pretty
conventional
gesture
of
maternal
regret
walter
stood
looking
on
with
mingled
amazement
and
pleasure
pleased
as
if
he
were
at
a
play
with
all
the
new
indications
of
domestic
history
which
were
opening
to
him
and
with
a
sense
of
enjoyment
through
all
his
being
when
the
girl
sprang
into
the
boat
and
hamish
conspicuous
in
his
red
shirt
pushed
off
into
the
loch
the
tumult
of
became
almost
articulate
he
laughed
to
himself
under
his
breath
remembering
all
the
greetings
he
had
heard
along
the
line
of
railway
the
recognitions
at
every
station
your
daughter
seems
to
know
everybody
he
said
and
how
could
she
help
knowing
every
person
cried
mysie
taking
the
words
as
it
were
out
of
her
mistress
mouth
when
she
was
born
and
brought
up
on
the
loch
and
never
one
to
turn
her
back
upon
a
neebor
gentle
or
simple
but
just
adored
wherever
she
goes
oh
whisht
mysie
whisht
we
are
partial
said
forrester
with
her
little
antiquated
graces
and
then
she
invited
lord
erradeen
to
continue
his
walk
it
was
the
full
blaze
of
day
and
the
view
extended
as
they
went
higher
up
to
the
crest
of
rock
upon
which
the
house
was
set
it
was
built
of
irregular
reddish
stone
all
cropped
with
lichens
where
it
was
visible
but
so
covered
with
clinging
plants
that
very
little
of
the
walls
could
be
seen
the
rustic
porch
was
built
something
like
a
with
young
saplings
for
its
pillars
and
chairs
placed
within
its
shelter
there
were
some
laid
out
around
in
which
a
few
autumn
crocuses
had
struggled
into
pale
bloom
and
a
number
of
china
roses
hung
half
opened
against
the
sides
of
the
house
the
roofs
were
partly
blue
slates
that
most
prosaic
of
comfortable
coverings
and
partly
the
rough
red
tiles
of
the
country
which
shone
warm
through
the
naked
boughs
every
hardy
plant
could
bear
loch
katrine
keen
and
searching
air
was
garlanded
about
the
house
the
little
lawn
was
as
green
as
velvet
the
china
roses
were
pale
but
sweet
behind
the
house
were
the
mossed
of
a
primitive
orchard
among
the
rocky
shelves
it
lay
smiling
in
the
sun
with
the
silver
mirror
of
the
lake
all
round
and
every
tint
and
outline
doubled
in
the
water
from
the
door
the
dark
old
castle
of
kinloch
houran
stood
out
against
the
silent
darkness
of
the
hill
little
rocky
islets
like
a
sport
of
nature
too
small
to
be
inhabited
by
anything
bigger
than
rabbits
lay
all
reflected
in
broken
lines
of
rock
and
brushwood
between
walter
old
castle
and
this
romantic
house
they
were
so
visible
one
to
the
other
that
the
mere
position
seemed
to
form
a
link
of
connection
between
the
inhabitants
we
can
not
but
take
an
interest
in
you
you
see
lord
erradeen
for
we
can
never
get
out
of
sight
of
you
said
forrester
and
i
think
the
old
place
looks
better
from
here
than
any
other
view
i
have
seen
walter
added
almost
in
the
same
breath
they
laughed
as
they
spoke
together
it
was
not
possible
to
be
more
entirely
country
neighbours
the
young
man
had
a
fantastic
feeling
that
it
was
a
sort
of
flattery
to
himself
that
his
house
should
be
so
entirely
the
centre
of
the
landscape
he
followed
the
lady
into
the
house
with
a
little
reluctance
the
scene
was
so
enchanting
inside
the
roofs
were
low
but
the
rooms
and
comfortable
they
were
full
of
curiosities
of
every
kind
weapons
from
distant
countries
trophies
of
what
is
called
the
chase
hung
upon
the
wall
of
the
outer
hall
the
was
full
of
articles
from
india
and
china
carved
ivories
monsters
in
porcelain
all
the
wonders
that
people
used
to
send
home
before
we
got
japanese
shops
at
every
corner
an
air
of
gentle
refinement
was
everywhere
with
something
too
in
the
many
ornaments
little
luxuries
and
daintinesses
which
suggested
the
little
of
the
old
beauty
the
airs
and
graces
that
had
been
irresistible
to
a
previous
generation
you
will
just
stay
and
eat
your
luncheon
with
us
lord
erradeen
i
might
have
been
but
poor
company
an
old
woman
as
i
getting
but
now
that
oona
is
coming
i
need
not
be
too
modest
for
though
there
will
not
be
a
grand
luncheon
there
will
be
company
which
is
always
something
and
sit
down
and
tell
me
something
about
your
father
and
the
lady
he
married
and
where
you
have
been
living
all
this
time
walter
laughed
is
it
all
my
humble
history
you
want
me
to
tell
you
he
said
it
is
not
very
much
i
do
remember
my
father
and
the
lady
he
married
is
my
mother
you
know
the
best
mother
but
i
have
not
been
the
best
of
sons
i
was
an
idle
fellow
a
little
while
ago
nobody
knew
what
was
going
to
come
of
me
i
did
nothing
but
loaf
if
you
know
what
that
means
ah
that
i
do
said
forrester
that
was
just
like
my
jamie
but
now
they
tell
me
he
is
the
finest
officer
walter
paused
but
the
lady
was
once
more
entirely
attention
listening
with
her
hands
clasped
and
her
head
raised
to
his
with
an
ingratiating
sidelong
look
he
laughed
they
all
made
up
their
minds
i
was
to
be
yes
murmured
forrester
softly
half
closing
her
eyes
and
shaking
her
head
that
was
just
like
my
bob
till
he
took
a
thought
and
now
he
is
planting
coffee
in
ceylon
and
doing
well
yes
and
then
an
old
man
arrived
one
evening
said
walter
half
laughing
and
told
me
that
i
was
lord
erradeen
and
do
you
know
from
that
moment
nobody
not
even
i
myself
would
believe
that
i
had
ever
loafed
or
idled
or
been
there
was
a
pause
in
which
walter
thought
he
heard
some
one
move
behind
him
but
no
sound
reached
forrester
who
responded
eagerly
my
son
the
present
eaglescairn
was
just
of
the
same
kind
she
said
reflectively
she
had
a
comparison
ready
for
every
case
that
could
be
suggested
till
he
came
of
age
it
was
in
the
will
that
they
were
to
come
of
age
only
at
and
till
then
i
had
a
sore
time
oh
oona
my
dear
is
that
you
and
had
you
a
pleasant
evening
here
is
young
lord
erradeen
that
has
come
in
most
kindly
i
sure
to
tell
me
about
his
father
that
i
knew
so
well
and
it
appears
you
met
upon
the
coach
yesterday
come
away
my
dear
come
away
and
that
was
just
most
curious
that
knowing
nothing
of
one
another
you
should
meet
upon
the
coach
oona
came
in
lightly
in
her
dress
she
gave
walter
a
look
which
was
very
friendly
she
had
paused
for
a
moment
at
the
door
and
she
had
heard
his
confession
it
seemed
to
oona
that
what
he
said
was
generous
and
manly
she
was
used
to
forming
quick
impressions
she
had
been
annoyed
when
she
had
heard
from
hamish
of
the
visitor
but
her
mind
changed
when
she
heard
what
he
said
she
came
up
to
him
and
held
out
her
hand
the
fresh
air
was
in
her
face
which
walter
thought
was
like
the
morning
all
bright
and
fresh
and
full
of
life
she
made
him
a
little
curtsey
with
much
gravity
and
said
in
the
pretty
voice
which
was
so
fresh
and
sweet
and
with
that
novelty
of
accent
which
had
amused
and
delighted
the
young
man
you
are
welcome
to
your
own
country
lord
erradeen
now
that
is
very
pretty
of
you
oona
cried
her
mother
i
never
thought
you
would
remember
to
pay
your
little
compliment
as
a
person
should
for
to
tell
the
truth
she
is
just
too
brusque
it
is
her
fault
hamish
told
me
what
to
say
said
oona
with
a
glance
of
provocation
he
is
a
very
person
he
told
me
i
was
to
bid
my
lord
welcome
to
his
own
oh
my
dear
you
need
not
take
away
the
merit
of
it
as
if
you
had
not
thought
of
it
yourself
said
the
mother
aggrieved
but
run
away
and
take
off
your
hat
and
let
us
have
our
lunch
for
lord
erradeen
has
been
all
the
morning
on
the
water
and
he
will
be
hungry
and
you
are
all
blown
about
with
the
wind
the
young
people
exchanged
looks
while
forrester
made
her
little
protest
there
was
a
sort
of
laughing
interchange
between
them
in
which
she
was
mocking
and
he
apologetic
why
neither
could
have
said
they
understood
each
other
though
they
by
no
means
clearly
understood
each
what
he
and
she
meant
there
was
to
be
a
little
war
between
them
all
in
and
not
insipid
agreement
and
politeness
the
next
hour
was
walter
thought
the
most
pleasant
he
had
ever
spent
in
his
life
he
had
not
been
ignorant
of
such
enjoyments
before
when
we
said
that
various
mothers
in
sloebury
had
with
the
first
news
of
his
elevation
suffered
a
sudden
pang
of
to
think
how
they
had
put
a
stop
to
certain
passages
the
end
of
which
might
now
have
been
to
raise
a
daughter
to
the
peerage
it
must
have
been
understood
that
walter
was
not
altogether
a
novice
in
the
society
of
women
but
this
had
a
new
flavour
which
was
delightful
to
him
it
had
been
pleasant
enough
in
the
cottage
when
julia
herbert
sang
and
on
other
occasions
not
necessary
to
enter
into
but
on
this
romantic
isle
where
the
sound
of
the
loch
upon
the
rocks
made
a
soft
accompaniment
to
everything
in
a
retirement
which
no
vulgar
interruption
could
reach
with
the
faded
beauty
on
one
side
scarcely
able
to
forget
the
old
pretty
mannerisms
of
conquest
even
in
her
real
maternal
kindness
and
frank
highland
hospitality
and
the
girl
with
her
laughing
defiance
on
the
other
he
felt
himself
to
have
entered
a
new
chapter
of
history
the
whole
new
world
into
which
he
had
come
became
visible
to
him
in
their
conversation
he
heard
how
he
himself
had
been
looked
for
and
how
the
whole
loch
had
known
something
about
him
for
years
before
he
had
ever
heard
of
loch
houran
we
used
to
know
you
as
the
lad
oona
said
with
her
glance
of
mischief
all
this
amused
walter
more
than
words
can
say
the
sun
was
dropping
towards
the
west
before
escorted
to
the
by
both
the
ladies
and
taken
leave
of
as
an
old
friend
he
joined
the
duncan
and
addressed
himself
to
the
homeward
voyage
duncan
had
not
been
slow
of
speech
in
the
congenial
company
of
hamish
they
had
discussed
the
at
length
with
many
a
shaft
of
humour
and
criticism
during
the
visit
which
duncan
had
paid
to
the
kitchen
he
blushed
not
now
secure
in
the
stronghold
of
his
unknown
tongue
to
break
off
in
a
witty
remark
at
walter
expense
as
he
turned
to
his
master
his
beaming
smile
of
devotion
they
set
off
together
master
and
man
happy
yet
regretful
upon
their
homeward
way
and
it
was
a
tough
row
back
to
kinloch
houran
against
the
fresh
and
not
too
quiet
highland
wind
chapter
xii
the
castle
looked
more
grim
and
ruined
than
ever
as
walter
set
foot
once
more
upon
the
rough
grass
of
the
mound
behind
he
dismissed
the
smiling
duncan
with
regret
as
he
went
up
to
the
door
which
now
stood
open
he
thought
to
himself
with
relief
that
another
day
would
finish
his
probation
here
and
that
already
it
was
more
than
half
over
but
next
moment
remembered
that
the
end
of
his
stay
at
kinloch
houran
would
mean
also
an
end
of
intercourse
with
his
new
friends
which
gave
a
different
aspect
to
the
matter
altogether
at
the
door
of
the
castle
old
macalister
was
waiting
with
a
look
of
anxiety
ye
have
had
no
luncheon
he
said
and
here
shaw
the
factor
waiting
to
see
ye
macalister
had
not
the
manners
of
symington
and
walter
already
felt
that
it
was
a
curious
eccentricity
on
the
part
of
the
old
man
to
leave
out
his
title
the
factor
was
seated
waiting
in
the
room
he
was
a
man
with
grizzled
reddish
locks
the
prototype
in
a
higher
class
of
duncan
in
the
boat
he
got
up
with
a
cordial
friendliness
which
walter
began
to
feel
characteristic
but
which
was
also
perhaps
less
respectful
than
might
have
been
supposed
appropriate
to
meet
him
he
had
a
great
deal
to
say
of
business
which
to
walter
was
still
scarcely
intelligible
there
were
leases
to
renew
and
there
was
some
question
about
a
number
of
crofter
families
which
seemed
to
have
been
debated
with
the
former
lord
and
to
have
formed
the
subject
of
much
discussion
there
is
that
question
about
the
crofters
at
the
shaw
said
what
crofters
or
rather
what
are
crofters
and
what
is
the
question
and
where
is
the
lord
erradeen
said
he
pronounced
it
alas
truack
as
he
still
called
loch
lock
which
made
the
sensitive
natives
shudder
shaw
looked
at
him
with
a
little
disapproval
he
felt
that
the
english
lad
should
have
been
more
impressed
by
his
new
inheritance
and
more
anxious
to
acquire
a
mastery
of
all
the
facts
connected
with
it
if
instead
of
wandering
about
the
loch
all
the
morning
he
had
been
looking
up
the
details
of
the
business
and
the
boundaries
of
the
estate
and
studying
the
map
but
that
not
being
the
case
of
course
there
was
nothing
to
be
done
but
to
explain
i
had
thought
that
milnathort
would
have
put
the
needs
of
the
estate
more
clearly
before
you
there
are
several
questions
to
be
settled
i
do
know
what
may
be
your
views
as
to
a
landlord
duties
lord
erradeen
i
have
no
views
said
walter
i
am
quite
impartial
you
must
recollect
that
i
have
only
been
a
landlord
for
a
fortnight
but
i
suppose
said
the
factor
somewhat
severely
that
the
heir
to
such
a
fine
property
has
had
some
kind
of
a
little
training
i
have
had
no
training
not
the
slightest
i
had
no
information
even
that
i
was
the
heir
to
any
property
you
must
consider
me
as
entirely
ignorant
but
ready
to
learn
shaw
looked
at
him
with
some
surprise
but
severely
still
it
is
very
curious
he
said
as
if
that
too
had
been
walter
fault
that
you
did
not
know
you
were
the
heir
we
knew
very
well
here
but
the
late
lord
was
like
most
people
not
very
keen
about
his
successor
and
then
he
was
a
comparatively
young
man
when
he
died
i
know
nothing
of
my
predecessor
said
walter
what
was
the
cause
of
his
death
i
should
like
to
hear
something
about
him
several
of
them
must
have
died
young
i
suppose
or
i
so
far
off
could
never
have
become
the
heir
the
factor
looked
at
him
keenly
but
with
doubtful
eyes
there
are
secrets
in
all
families
my
lord
erradeen
he
said
are
there
i
thought
that
was
rather
an
sentiment
i
do
think
except
that
i
was
not
always
virtuously
occupied
that
there
was
any
secret
in
mine
and
i
am
sure
there
is
no
secret
in
mine
said
shaw
energetically
but
then
you
see
i
am
not
and
you
were
not
till
a
very
recent
date
lord
erradeen
there
is
a
kind
of
something
in
the
race
that
i
will
not
characterise
it
is
a
kind
of
a
melancholy
turn
the
vulgar
rumours
ye
will
have
heard
to
which
i
attach
no
credence
it
is
little
worth
while
living
in
the
nineteenth
century
the
factor
said
with
emphasis
if
ye
are
to
be
subject
to
delusions
like
that
i
tell
you
i
am
quite
ignorant
and
except
by
hints
which
i
could
not
understand
milnathort
did
not
give
me
any
information
speak
plainly
i
want
to
know
what
the
mystery
is
why
am
i
here
in
this
old
place
walter
cried
with
an
accent
of
impatience
shaw
kept
a
watchful
eye
upon
him
with
the
air
of
a
man
whom
another
is
trying
to
deceive
it
is
something
in
the
blood
i
thinking
the
factor
said
they
all
seem
to
find
out
there
a
kind
of
contrariety
in
life
which
is
a
thing
we
all
must
do
to
be
sure
but
generally
without
any
fatal
effects
after
a
certain
age
they
all
seem
to
give
way
to
it
i
hope
that
my
lord
being
out
of
the
direct
line
will
escape
the
populace
if
ye
can
accept
their
nonsense
say
it
a
well
something
supernatural
a
kind
of
an
influence
from
him
they
call
the
warlock
lord
shaw
laughed
but
somewhat
uneasily
apologetically
i
think
shame
to
dwell
upon
such
absurdity
he
said
it
does
sound
very
absurd
that
is
just
it
nonsense
not
worth
the
consideration
of
sensible
men
and
i
may
say
to
you
that
are
i
hope
of
a
more
wholesome
mind
that
they
are
terribly
given
up
to
caprice
in
this
family
the
crofters
have
been
up
and
down
twenty
times
the
late
lord
made
up
his
mind
he
would
let
them
stay
and
then
that
they
must
go
and
again
that
he
would
just
leave
them
their
bits
of
places
and
then
that
he
would
help
them
to
emigrate
and
after
all
i
had
the
order
that
they
were
to
be
turned
out
bag
and
baggage
i
could
not
find
it
in
my
heart
to
do
it
i
just
put
off
and
put
off
and
here
he
is
dead
and
another
said
shaw
with
a
suppressed
tone
of
satisfaction
come
to
the
throne
and
you
a
new
man
and
a
young
man
and
belong
to
your
own
century
not
to
the
middle
ages
the
factor
cried
with
a
little
vehemence
then
he
stopped
himself
with
a
i
beg
your
pardon
my
lord
i
am
perhaps
saying
more
than
i
ought
to
say
walter
made
no
reply
he
was
not
sure
that
he
did
not
think
the
factor
was
going
too
far
for
though
he
knew
so
little
of
his
family
he
already
felt
that
it
was
something
not
to
be
subjected
to
discussion
by
common
men
these
animadversions
touched
his
pride
a
little
but
he
was
silent
too
proud
to
make
any
remark
he
said
after
a
pause
i
do
know
that
i
can
give
my
opinion
without
a
further
acquaintance
with
the
facts
if
i
were
to
do
so
on
so
slight
a
knowledge
i
fear
you
might
think
that
a
caprice
too
the
factor
looked
at
him
with
a
still
closer
scrutiny
and
took
the
hint
there
is
nothing
upon
which
it
is
so
necessary
to
understand
the
permitted
limit
of
observation
as
in
the
discussion
of
family
peculiarities
though
he
was
so
little
responsible
for
this
and
even
so
little
acquainted
with
them
it
was
impossible
that
lord
erradeen
should
not
associate
himself
with
his
race
shaw
got
out
his
papers
and
entered
upon
the
questions
in
which
the
opinion
of
the
new
proprietor
was
important
without
a
word
further
about
the
late
lord
and
the
family
characteristics
he
explained
to
walter
at
length
the
position
of
the
crofters
with
their
small
holdings
who
in
bad
seasons
got
into
arrears
with
their
rents
and
sometimes
became
a
burden
upon
the
landlord
in
whom
so
far
north
there
was
some
admixture
of
a
highland
chief
the
scheme
of
the
estate
altogether
was
of
a
mixed
kind
there
were
some
large
sheep
farms
and
extensive
moors
still
intermingled
with
glens
more
populated
than
is
usual
in
these
regions
some
of
them
were
on
lands
but
recently
acquired
and
the
crofters
in
particular
were
a
burden
transmitted
by
purchase
which
the
father
of
the
last
lord
had
made
it
was
believed
that
there
had
been
some
covenant
in
the
sale
by
which
the
rights
of
the
poor
people
were
secured
but
this
had
fallen
into
forgetfulness
and
there
was
no
reason
in
law
why
lord
erradeen
should
not
exercise
all
the
rights
of
a
proprietor
and
clear
the
glen
as
so
many
glens
had
been
cleared
this
was
the
first
question
that
the
new
lord
would
have
to
decide
the
humble
tenants
were
all
under
notice
to
leave
and
indeed
were
subject
to
eviction
as
soon
as
their
landlord
pleased
it
was
with
a
kind
of
horror
that
walter
listened
to
this
account
of
his
new
possibilities
eviction
he
said
do
you
mean
the
sort
of
thing
that
happens
in
ireland
he
held
his
breath
in
unfeigned
dismay
and
repugnance
i
thought
there
was
nothing
of
the
sort
here
ireland
is
one
thing
and
scotland
another
said
the
factor
we
are
a
people
no
man
will
ever
be
shot
down
behind
a
hedge
by
a
highlander
so
if
you
should
resolve
to
turn
them
out
my
lord
ye
need
stand
in
no
personal
fear
walter
put
aside
this
somewhat
contemptuous
assurance
with
a
wave
of
his
hand
i
have
been
told
of
a
great
many
things
i
could
do
he
said
in
this
last
fortnight
but
i
never
knew
before
that
i
could
turn
out
a
whole
village
full
of
people
if
i
chose
and
make
their
houses
desolate
it
was
a
new
view
altogether
of
his
new
powers
he
could
not
help
returning
in
thought
to
all
the
prepossessions
of
his
former
existence
where
arbitrary
power
was
unknown
and
where
a
mild
general
beneficence
towards
the
poor
was
the
rule
he
said
half
to
himself
what
would
my
mother
say
and
in
the
novelty
of
the
idea
half
laughed
what
a
thrill
it
would
send
through
the
district
visitors
the
managers
of
the
soup
kitchen
all
the
charitable
people
there
suddenly
came
up
before
him
a
recollection
of
many
a
conversation
he
had
heard
and
taken
no
note
of
of
consultations
how
to
pay
the
rent
of
a
poor
family
here
and
there
how
to
stop
a
cruel
landlord
mouth
and
that
he
should
appear
in
the
character
of
a
cruel
landlord
no
doubt
it
would
have
been
easy
to
show
that
the
circumstances
were
quite
different
but
in
the
mean
time
the
son
of
methven
could
not
throw
off
the
traditions
in
which
he
had
been
brought
up
he
contemplated
the
whole
matter
from
a
point
of
view
altogether
different
even
from
that
of
shaw
the
factor
shaw
was
prepared
to
prove
that
on
the
whole
the
poor
crofters
were
not
such
bad
tenants
and
that
sheep
farms
and
deer
forests
though
more
easily
dealt
with
had
some
disadvantages
too
for
there
was
paterson
of
inverchory
that
had
been
nearly
ruined
by
a
bad
lambing
season
and
had
lost
the
half
of
his
flock
and
as
for
the
shootings
was
there
not
the
dreadful
example
before
them
of
the
moors
at
finlarig
where
everything
had
been
shot
down
and
the
game
fairly
exterminated
by
a
set
of
fellows
that
either
did
not
know
what
they
were
doing
or
else
were
making
money
of
it
and
not
pleasure
the
very
veins
in
shaw
forehead
swelled
when
he
spoke
of
this
i
would
like
to
have
had
the
ducking
of
him
he
cried
a
man
with
a
grand
name
and
the
soul
of
a
henwife
that
swept
out
the
place
as
if
he
had
done
it
with
a
broom
and
all
for
the
london
market
grant
me
patience
you
will
say
added
shaw
that
the
thing
to
do
at
inverchory
is
to
get
a
man
with
more
capital
now
that
john
paterson
tack
is
done
and
that
there
few
sportsmen
like
sir
john
that
all
very
true
but
it
just
shows
there
are
risks
to
be
run
in
all
ways
and
the
poor
folk
at
would
never
lead
you
into
losses
like
that
walter
however
did
not
pay
much
attention
even
to
this
view
his
mind
had
not
room
at
the
moment
for
paterson
of
inverchory
who
was
behind
with
the
rent
or
sir
john
who
had
devastated
the
moors
he
did
not
get
beyond
the
primitive
natural
horror
of
what
seemed
to
him
an
outrage
of
all
natural
laws
and
kindness
he
had
not
been
a
landowner
long
enough
to
feel
the
sacred
right
of
property
he
turn
the
cottagers
out
of
their
poor
little
homes
for
the
sake
of
a
few
pounds
more
or
less
of
which
he
stood
in
no
need
the
very
arguments
against
taking
this
step
made
him
angry
could
anybody
suppose
he
could
do
it
he
walter
methven
as
for
the
erradeen
business
and
all
this
new
affair
altogether
good
heavens
if
anybody
thought
he
would
purchase
it
by
that
in
short
the
young
man
who
was
not
born
a
grand
seigneur
boiled
up
in
righteous
wrath
and
felt
it
high
scorn
and
shame
that
it
could
be
supposed
of
him
that
he
was
capable
being
rich
of
oppressing
the
poor
which
was
the
way
in
which
he
put
it
in
his
limited
conditions
of
thought
shaw
was
by
the
interview
he
said
to
the
minister
with
whom
he
stopped
to
dine
and
who
was
naturally
much
interested
about
the
new
young
man
that
assuredly
the
young
fellow
had
a
great
deal
of
good
in
him
but
he
was
a
trifle
narrow
in
his
way
of
looking
at
a
question
which
is
probably
just
his
english
breeding
the
factor
said
i
would
have
put
the
crofter
question
before
him
in
all
its
bearings
but
he
was
just
out
of
himself
at
the
idea
of
eviction
like
what
happened
in
ireland
he
said
i
could
not
get
him
to
go
into
the
philosophy
of
it
he
just
would
not
hear
a
word
nothing
of
the
kind
had
ever
come
his
way
before
one
could
see
and
he
was
just
horrified
at
the
thought
i
do
call
that
leemited
i
call
it
christian
the
minister
said
and
i
am
not
surprised
he
should
have
a
horror
of
it
i
will
go
and
see
him
in
the
morning
if
you
think
it
will
be
well
taken
for
i
with
him
in
that
heart
and
soul
yes
yes
that
all
in
your
way
said
shaw
but
i
am
surprised
at
it
in
a
young
man
there
is
a
kind
of
innocence
about
it
but
i
would
not
wonder
after
a
little
if
he
should
change
his
mind
as
others
have
done
do
you
form
any
theory
in
your
own
thoughts
shaw
said
the
minister
as
to
what
it
is
that
makes
them
so
apt
to
change
not
i
cried
the
factor
with
a
shrug
of
his
shoulders
and
then
he
added
hurriedly
you
given
me
a
capital
dinner
and
that
whisky
is
just
excellent
but
i
think
i
must
be
going
my
ways
for
already
later
than
i
thought
cameron
who
was
minister
of
the
parish
was
like
walter
a
stranger
to
the
district
and
its
ways
he
was
a
great
antiquary
and
full
of
curiosity
about
all
the
relics
of
the
past
and
he
had
an
enlightened
interest
in
its
superstitions
too
but
shaw
was
a
loch
houran
man
he
had
a
reverence
for
the
traditions
which
of
course
he
vowed
he
did
not
believe
and
though
he
was
very
ready
to
make
this
statement
in
his
own
person
he
did
not
like
to
hear
outsiders
as
he
called
the
rest
of
the
world
discussing
them
disrespectfully
so
he
desired
his
to
be
brought
round
and
drove
home
in
the
clear
cold
night
warm
at
his
heart
good
man
because
of
the
good
news
for
the
crofters
but
a
little
dissatisfied
in
his
mind
that
the
new
lord
should
be
doing
this
simply
as
a
matter
of
sentiment
and
not
from
a
reasonable
view
of
the
situation
provided
even
that
he
keeps
of
that
mind
the
factor
said
to
himself
walter
subsided
out
of
his
just
indignation
when
the
business
part
of
the
interview
ended
and
he
came
out
to
the
open
air
to
see
shaw
away
this
must
all
be
put
in
order
he
said
as
he
accompanied
his
visitor
to
the
boat
shaw
looked
at
him
with
a
little
curiosity
mingled
with
a
slight
air
of
alarm
auchnasheen
being
so
near
he
said
which
is
a
very
comfortable
place
there
has
never
been
much
notice
taken
of
the
old
castle
but
i
mean
to
take
a
great
deal
of
notice
of
it
the
young
man
said
with
a
laugh
i
shall
have
some
of
the
antiquaries
down
and
clear
out
all
the
old
places
his
laugh
seemed
to
himself
to
rouse
the
echoes
but
it
called
forth
no
responsive
sound
from
his
companion
and
he
caught
a
glimpse
of
old
macalister
in
the
distance
shaking
his
old
head
this
amused
yet
slightly
irritated
walter
in
the
sense
of
power
which
alternated
with
a
sense
of
novelty
and
unreality
in
his
mind
so
you
object
to
that
he
said
to
the
old
man
you
do
like
your
privileges
invaded
it
no
that
said
macalister
but
ye
never
do
it
i
a
lang
lang
acquaintance
with
the
place
and
i
witnessed
many
a
revolution
if
i
may
say
sae
one
was
to
pull
down
the
auld
wa
altogether
another
was
to
clean
it
a
out
like
you
but
it
never
been
done
and
never
be
done
i
just
as
sure
o
that
as
your
young
lordship
is
that
you
have
a
the
power
in
your
hands
walter
turned
away
with
a
little
disdain
in
his
laugh
it
was
not
worth
while
arguing
out
the
matter
with
macalister
who
should
prevent
him
from
doing
what
he
liked
with
his
old
house
he
could
not
but
reflect
upon
the
curious
contradictions
with
which
he
was
beset
he
was
supposed
to
be
quite
capable
of
turning
out
a
whole
village
out
of
their
homes
and
making
them
homeless
and
destitute
but
he
was
not
supposed
capable
of
clearing
out
the
passage
and
rooms
of
an
old
ruin
he
smiled
with
a
kind
of
scornful
indignation
as
he
went
up
to
his
by
this
time
the
afternoon
had
lost
all
light
and
colour
it
was
not
dark
but
neither
was
it
day
a
greyness
had
come
into
the
atmosphere
the
shadows
were
black
and
had
lost
all
transparency
the
two
windows
made
two
bars
of
a
more
distinct
greyness
in
the
room
with
a
deep
line
of
shade
in
the
centre
between
which
was
coloured
but
scarcely
lighted
up
by
the
fire
he
could
not
but
think
with
a
sense
of
relief
that
the
three
days
which
were
all
he
believed
that
were
necessary
for
his
stay
at
kinloch
houran
were
half
over
at
least
another
night
and
then
he
would
be
free
to
go
he
did
not
mean
to
go
any
further
than
to
auchnasheen
which
was
exactly
opposite
to
the
island
and
then
with
a
smile
creeping
about
the
corners
of
his
mouth
he
said
to
himself
that
he
could
very
well
amuse
himself
for
a
few
days
what
with
the
shooting
and
what
with
and
it
would
be
comfortable
to
get
out
of
this
place
where
the
air
he
could
not
tell
why
seemed
always
insufficient
the
wainscot
the
dark
hangings
the
heavy
old
walls
seemed
to
absorb
the
atmosphere
he
threw
up
the
window
to
get
a
little
air
but
somehow
the
projecting
masonry
of
the
old
walls
outside
seemed
to
intercept
it
he
felt
an
oppression
in
his
breast
a
desire
to
draw
long
breaths
to
get
more
air
into
his
lungs
it
was
the
same
sensation
which
he
had
felt
last
night
and
he
did
not
contemplate
with
any
pleasure
the
idea
of
another
long
evening
alone
in
so
strange
an
atmosphere
however
he
must
make
the
best
of
it
he
went
to
the
bookshelf
and
got
down
again
his
when
the
candles
were
lighted
he
would
write
a
dutiful
long
letter
to
his
mother
and
tell
her
all
that
had
been
going
on
about
him
especially
that
barbarous
suggestion
about
the
cottagers
fancy
me
in
the
character
of
a
rapacious
landlord
turning
a
whole
community
out
of
doors
he
said
to
himself
concocting
the
imaginary
letter
and
laughed
aloud
with
a
thrill
of
indignation
next
moment
he
started
violently
and
turned
round
with
a
wild
rush
of
blood
to
his
head
and
that
sort
of
rallying
and
huddling
together
of
all
the
forces
of
his
mind
which
one
feels
in
a
sudden
catastrophe
it
was
however
no
loud
alarm
that
had
sounded
it
was
the
clear
and
distinct
vibration
of
a
voice
close
to
him
replying
calmly
to
his
thought
is
there
anything
special
in
you
to
disqualify
you
for
doing
a
disagreeable
duty
some
one
said
walter
had
started
back
at
the
first
sound
his
heart
giving
a
bound
in
him
of
surprise
perhaps
of
terror
he
had
meant
to
take
that
great
chair
by
the
fire
as
soon
as
he
had
taken
his
book
from
the
shelf
so
that
it
must
he
said
to
himself
in
instantaneous
have
been
vacant
then
it
was
not
vacant
now
a
gentleman
sat
there
with
his
face
half
turned
towards
the
light
looking
towards
the
young
man
his
attitude
was
perfectly
easy
his
voice
a
and
cultivated
voice
there
seemed
neither
hurry
nor
excitement
about
him
he
had
not
the
air
of
a
person
newly
entered
but
rather
of
one
who
had
been
seated
there
for
some
time
at
his
leisure
observing
what
was
going
on
he
lifted
his
hand
with
a
sort
of
deprecating
yet
commanding
gesture
there
is
no
occasion
he
said
in
his
measured
voice
for
alarm
i
have
no
intention
of
harming
you
or
any
one
indeed
i
am
not
aware
that
i
have
any
power
of
harm
never
in
his
life
before
had
walter
soul
been
swept
by
such
violent
sensations
he
had
an
impulse
of
flight
and
of
deadly
overwhelming
terror
and
then
of
sickening
shame
at
his
own
panic
why
should
he
be
afraid
he
felt
dimly
that
this
moment
was
the
crisis
of
his
life
and
that
if
he
fled
or
retreated
he
was
lost
he
stood
his
ground
grasping
the
back
of
a
chair
to
support
himself
who
are
you
he
said
that
is
a
searching
question
said
the
stranger
with
a
smile
we
will
come
to
it
by
and
by
i
should
like
to
know
in
the
first
place
what
there
is
in
you
which
makes
it
impossible
to
act
with
justice
in
certain
circumstances
the
air
of
absolute
and
calm
superiority
with
which
he
put
this
question
was
beyond
description
walter
felt
like
a
criminal
at
the
bar
who
are
you
he
repeated
hoarsely
he
stood
with
a
curious
sense
of
being
supported
only
by
the
grasp
which
he
had
taken
of
the
back
of
the
chair
feeling
himself
a
mere
bundle
of
impulses
and
sensations
hardly
able
to
keep
himself
from
flight
hardly
able
to
keep
from
falling
down
at
the
feet
of
this
intruder
but
holding
to
a
sort
of
by
his
grasp
upon
the
chair
naturally
however
his
nerves
steadied
as
the
moments
passed
the
first
extreme
shock
of
surprise
wore
away
there
was
nothing
to
alarm
the
most
timid
in
the
countenance
upon
which
he
gazed
it
was
that
of
a
handsome
man
who
had
scarcely
turned
middle
age
with
grey
but
not
white
hair
very
thin
on
the
forehead
and
temples
a
high
delicate
aquiline
nose
and
colourless
complexion
his
mouth
closed
somewhat
sternly
but
had
a
faint
melting
of
a
smile
about
it
by
movements
which
were
ingratiating
and
almost
sweet
the
chief
thing
remarkable
about
the
stranger
however
besides
the
extraordinary
suddenness
of
his
appearance
was
the
perfect
composure
with
which
he
sat
like
a
man
who
not
only
was
the
most
important
person
wherever
he
went
but
also
complete
master
of
the
present
scene
it
was
the
young
man
who
was
the
intruder
not
he
i
will
tell
you
presently
who
i
am
he
said
in
the
mean
time
explain
to
me
why
you
should
be
horrified
at
a
step
which
better
men
than
yourself
take
every
day
sit
down
the
stranger
allowed
himself
to
smile
with
distinct
intention
and
then
said
in
a
tone
of
which
it
is
impossible
to
describe
the
refined
mockery
you
are
afraid
walter
came
to
himself
with
another
sensible
shock
his
pride
his
natural
spirit
a
certain
impulse
of
which
never
forsakes
a
man
came
to
his
aid
he
was
inclined
to
say
no
with
natural
denial
of
a
contemptuous
accusation
but
rallying
more
and
more
every
moment
answered
with
something
like
defiance
yes
or
rather
i
am
not
afraid
i
am
startled
i
want
to
know
how
you
come
here
and
who
you
are
who
question
me
in
my
own
house
you
are
very
sure
that
it
is
your
own
house
you
mean
to
have
it
restored
and
made
into
a
piece
of
sham
antiquity
if
nothing
prevents
what
can
prevent
if
i
say
it
is
to
be
done
cried
the
young
man
his
blood
seemed
to
curdle
in
his
veins
when
he
heard
the
low
laugh
with
which
alone
the
stranger
replied
may
i
ask
you
to
withdraw
or
to
tell
me
who
you
are
he
said
his
voice
trembled
in
spite
of
himself
the
words
left
his
lips
quite
sturdily
but
quivered
when
they
got
into
the
air
or
so
in
the
fantastic
hurry
of
his
mind
he
thought
if
i
refuse
what
then
the
stranger
said
these
two
individuals
confronted
each
other
defying
each
other
one
angry
and
nervous
the
other
perfectly
calm
in
such
circumstances
only
one
result
is
sure
that
he
who
retains
his
will
have
the
mastery
walter
felt
himself
completely
baffled
he
could
not
turn
out
with
violence
a
dignified
and
serious
visitor
who
assumed
indeed
an
intolerable
superiority
and
had
come
in
without
asking
leave
but
yet
was
evidently
a
person
of
importance
if
nothing
more
he
stared
at
him
for
a
moment
gradually
becoming
familiarized
with
the
circumstances
you
are
master
of
the
situation
he
said
with
a
breath
i
suppose
i
can
do
nothing
but
submit
but
if
politeness
on
my
part
requires
this
of
me
it
requires
on
yours
some
information
your
name
your
object
they
looked
at
each
other
once
more
for
a
moment
when
you
put
it
in
that
way
i
have
nothing
to
say
said
the
stranger
with
great
courtesy
but
to
acknowledge
your
right
to
require
at
that
moment
the
door
opened
hurriedly
and
symington
came
in
your
lordship
will
be
wanting
something
he
said
i
heard
your
voice
was
it
to
light
the
lights
or
would
it
be
for
tea
or
he
gave
a
sort
of
scared
glance
round
the
room
and
clung
to
the
handle
of
the
door
but
his
eyes
did
not
seem
to
distinguish
the
in
the
failing
twilight
i
did
not
call
but
you
may
light
the
candles
walter
said
feeling
his
own
excitement
which
had
been
subsiding
spring
up
again
in
his
curiosity
to
see
what
symington
sensations
would
be
the
old
man
came
in
reluctantly
he
muttered
something
uneasily
in
his
throat
i
would
have
brought
a
light
if
i
had
known
you
might
have
cried
down
the
stairs
it
just
out
of
all
order
to
light
the
lights
this
gate
he
muttered
but
he
did
not
disobey
he
went
round
the
room
lighting
one
after
another
of
the
twinkling
candles
in
the
sconces
now
and
then
he
gave
a
scared
and
tremulous
look
about
him
but
he
took
no
further
notice
the
stranger
sat
quite
composedly
looking
on
with
a
smile
while
this
process
was
gone
through
then
symington
came
up
to
the
table
in
front
of
which
walter
still
stood
take
a
seat
my
lord
take
a
seat
he
said
it
no
canny
to
see
you
standing
just
glowering
frae
ye
as
we
say
in
the
country
you
look
just
as
if
you
were
seeing
something
and
take
you
your
french
fallow
that
you
were
reading
last
night
it
better
when
you
by
yourself
in
an
auld
house
like
this
that
has
an
always
to
do
something
to
occupy
your
thoughts
walter
looked
at
the
stranger
who
made
a
little
gesture
of
intelligence
with
a
nod
and
smile
and
old
symington
followed
the
look
still
with
that
scared
expression
on
his
face
your
lordship
looks
for
all
the
world
as
if
you
were
staring
at
something
in
that
big
chair
you
must
be
careful
to
take
no
fancies
in
your
head
the
old
servant
said
he
gave
a
little
nervous
laugh
and
retreated
somewhat
quickly
towards
the
door
and
talk
no
more
to
yourself
it
an
ill
habit
he
added
with
one
more
troubled
glance
round
him
as
he
closed
the
door
chapter
xiii
and
so
you
have
made
acquaintance
with
the
young
lord
tell
us
what
kind
of
person
he
is
forrester
tell
us
what
you
think
of
him
oona
this
was
the
unanimous
voice
which
rose
from
the
party
assembled
on
the
second
day
after
walter
visit
in
the
in
the
isle
it
was
by
no
means
out
of
the
world
though
to
all
appearances
so
far
removed
from
its
commotions
a
low
on
the
crest
of
a
rock
in
the
middle
of
loch
houran
six
miles
from
the
railway
at
the
nearest
spot
on
which
you
could
land
and
with
a
mile
or
so
of
water
often
rough
between
you
and
the
is
it
possible
to
imagine
a
more
complete
seclusion
and
yet
it
was
not
a
seclusion
at
all
oona
cared
very
little
for
the
roughness
of
the
water
between
the
isle
and
the
and
hamish
nothing
at
all
and
news
came
as
constantly
and
as
regularly
to
the
two
ladies
on
their
island
as
to
any
newspaper
news
from
all
quarters
of
the
world
the
mail
days
were
almost
as
important
to
them
in
one
way
far
more
important
than
to
any
merchant
in
his
office
budgets
came
and
went
every
week
and
both
oona
and
her
mother
would
be
busy
till
late
at
night
the
little
gleam
of
their
lighted
windows
shining
over
the
dark
loch
that
no
one
might
miss
his
or
her
weekly
letter
these
letters
went
up
into
the
hill
countries
in
india
far
away
to
the
borders
of
cashmere
round
the
world
to
australia
dropt
midway
into
the
coffee
groves
of
ceylon
when
one
of
the
boys
was
quartered
in
canada
to
which
there
is
a
mail
three
times
a
week
looked
like
next
parish
and
they
thought
nothing
of
it
neither
need
it
be
supposed
that
this
was
the
only
enlivenment
of
their
lives
the
loch
though
to
the
tourist
it
looks
silent
enough
was
in
fact
fringed
by
a
number
of
houses
in
which
the
liveliest
existence
was
going
on
the
big
new
house
at
the
point
which
had
been
built
by
a
wealthy
man
of
glasgow
with
every
possible
splendour
threw
the
homelier
houses
of
the
native
gentry
a
little
into
the
shade
but
nobody
bore
him
any
malice
his
neighbours
being
all
so
well
aware
that
their
own
position
was
known
and
unassailable
that
his
finery
and
his
costliness
gave
them
no
pang
they
were
all
a
little
particular
about
their
position
but
then
nobody
on
the
loch
could
make
any
mistake
about
that
or
for
a
moment
imagine
that
williamson
from
glasgow
could
rival
the
scotts
of
inverhouran
the
campbells
of
ellermore
of
glentruan
and
half
a
dozen
names
beside
or
the
forresters
of
eaglescairn
or
the
old
montroses
who
in
fact
were
a
branch
of
the
macnabs
and
held
their
house
on
the
isle
from
that
important
but
extinct
clan
this
was
so
clearly
understood
that
there
was
not
an
exception
made
to
the
williamsons
who
knew
their
place
and
were
very
nice
and
made
a
joke
of
their
money
which
was
their
social
standing
ground
they
had
called
their
house
which
was
as
big
as
a
castle
in
the
most
unobtrusive
manner
birkenbraes
thus
proving
at
once
that
they
were
new
people
and
lowlanders
so
much
better
taste
everybody
said
than
any
pretence
at
highland
importance
or
name
and
this
being
once
acknowledged
the
gentry
of
the
loch
adopted
the
williamsons
cordially
and
there
was
not
a
word
to
be
said
but
all
the
campbells
about
and
those
excellent
williamsons
and
a
few
families
who
were
not
campbells
yet
belonged
to
loch
houran
kept
a
good
deal
of
life
on
the
loch
which
was
a
phrase
that
meant
in
the
district
generally
and
the
isle
was
not
a
dull
habitation
whatever
a
stranger
might
think
there
was
seldom
a
day
when
a
boat
or
two
was
not
to
be
seen
sometimes
for
hours
together
drawn
up
upon
the
rocky
beach
and
the
number
of
persons
entertained
by
forrester
at
the
early
dinner
which
was
politely
called
luncheon
would
have
appeared
quite
out
of
proportion
with
her
means
by
any
one
unacquainted
with
highland
ways
there
was
trout
from
the
loch
which
cost
nothing
except
hamish
time
a
commodity
not
too
valuable
and
there
was
grouse
during
the
season
which
cost
still
less
seeing
it
came
from
all
the
sportsmen
about
and
the
scones
of
every
variety
known
in
scotland
which
is
a
wide
word
were
so
that
hospitality
reigned
and
yet
forrester
who
was
a
skilled
housekeeper
and
mysie
to
whom
the
family
resources
were
as
her
own
and
its
credit
still
more
precious
than
her
own
managed
somehow
to
make
ends
meet
on
this
particular
afternoon
the
with
all
its
slim
sofas
and
curiosities
was
full
of
campbells
for
young
colin
of
ellermore
was
at
home
for
his
holiday
and
it
was
a
matter
of
course
that
his
sisters
and
tom
the
youngest
who
was
at
home
reading
very
little
for
his
coming
examination
should
bring
him
to
the
isle
colin
was
rather
a
finer
gentleman
than
flourished
by
nature
upon
the
loch
he
had
little
company
ways
which
made
his
people
laugh
but
when
he
had
been
long
enough
at
home
to
forget
these
he
was
very
nice
they
all
said
he
was
in
london
and
though
in
trade
in
tea
which
is
rather
aristocratic
he
was
in
society
too
what
kind
of
person
is
he
forrester
tell
us
what
you
think
of
him
oona
was
what
this
youthful
band
said
well
my
dears
said
forrester
he
is
just
a
very
nice
young
man
i
do
know
how
i
can
describe
him
better
for
young
men
are
very
like
one
another
they
all
wear
the
same
clothes
not
but
what
she
added
graciously
i
would
know
colin
anywhere
for
a
london
gentleman
with
his
things
all
so
well
made
but
lord
erradeen
was
just
in
a
kind
of
tweed
suit
and
nothing
remarkable
and
his
hands
in
his
pockets
like
all
of
ye
but
he
answered
very
nicely
when
i
spoke
to
him
and
said
he
was
more
used
to
walter
methven
than
to
any
other
name
and
that
to
be
neighbourlike
would
just
be
his
pleasure
it
is
not
possible
to
be
more
pleasant
and
than
the
young
man
was
oh
but
i
want
a
little
more
cried
marjorie
campbell
that
tells
nothing
is
he
fair
or
is
he
dark
is
he
tall
or
is
he
little
is
he
he
could
be
little
cried
janet
indignantly
or
he
would
not
be
a
hero
and
i
made
up
my
mind
he
to
be
a
hero
he
have
to
do
something
grand
but
i
do
know
what
and
to
spoil
it
all
with
making
him
small
heroes
are
all
short
said
tom
and
all
the
great
generals
you
want
weedy
fellows
like
colin
and
the
rest
of
them
but
you
know
they
all
run
to
legs
in
our
family
all
but
me
all
this
is
irrelevant
said
colin
with
a
smile
which
was
somewhat
superior
and
you
prevent
forrester
from
giving
us
the
masterly
characterisation
which
i
know
is
on
her
lips
you
are
just
a
flatterer
said
that
simple
lady
shaking
her
finger
at
him
there
was
no
character
coming
from
my
lips
he
is
just
a
fine
young
man
it
appears
he
never
knew
what
he
was
heir
to
and
has
no
understanding
even
now
so
far
as
i
could
learn
about
the
erradeens
he
told
me
he
had
been
a
thoughtless
lad
and
as
well
as
i
could
judge
just
a
handful
to
his
poor
mother
but
that
all
that
was
over
and
gone
you
are
going
too
far
mamma
said
oona
he
said
he
had
loafing
means
no
harm
does
it
colin
it
means
mere
idleness
and
no
more
why
should
you
think
i
am
an
authority
on
the
subject
said
colin
i
never
loaf
i
go
to
the
city
every
day
when
i
come
back
i
have
to
keep
up
society
so
far
as
i
can
and
hunt
about
for
invitations
otherwise
i
should
never
be
asked
out
that
is
not
loafing
it
is
hard
work
ask
me
oona
said
young
tom
i
can
tell
you
it
is
the
nicest
thing
in
the
world
it
means
just
doing
nothing
you
are
wanted
to
do
taking
your
own
way
watching
nature
do
you
know
and
studying
men
and
that
sort
of
thing
which
all
the
literary
people
say
is
better
than
cramming
but
only
it
does
not
pay
in
an
exam
oh
hold
your
tongue
tommy
cried
his
sister
you
will
fail
again
you
know
you
will
and
papa
will
be
in
despair
for
you
are
not
like
colin
who
is
clever
you
are
good
for
nothing
but
soldiering
and
next
year
you
will
be
too
old
it
a
shame
cried
tom
hotly
to
make
a
fellow
commission
depend
upon
his
spelling
what
has
spelling
to
do
with
it
but
i
going
into
the
militia
and
then
i
shall
be
all
right
and
did
erradeen
said
colin
to
forrester
let
out
any
of
the
secrets
of
his
bless
me
he
looked
just
as
cheerful
as
yourself
or
even
as
tom
there
was
nothing
miserable
about
him
forrester
replied
he
had
been
all
the
morning
enjoying
himself
on
the
loch
and
he
came
up
and
ate
his
lunch
just
very
hearty
and
as
happy
as
possible
with
oona
and
me
he
was
just
very
like
my
own
ronald
or
rob
indeed
i
think
something
in
his
complexion
and
his
way
of
holding
himself
that
is
very
like
rob
and
took
my
opinion
about
the
old
castle
and
what
was
the
meaning
of
the
light
on
the
tower
indeed
added
forrester
with
a
laugh
i
do
know
if
it
is
anything
in
me
that
draws
people
to
tell
me
their
stories
but
it
is
a
very
general
thing
especially
for
young
persons
to
ask
for
my
advice
because
you
so
kind
said
janet
campbell
who
was
romantic
and
admired
the
old
beauty
because
you
so
clever
said
marjorie
who
had
a
turn
for
satire
oona
whose
ear
was
very
quick
for
any
supposed
or
possible
ridicule
such
as
her
mother
little
foibles
occasionally
laid
her
open
to
turned
quickly
round
from
tom
leaving
him
speaking
and
with
a
little
heightened
colour
interposed
we
are
opposite
to
the
castle
night
and
day
she
said
we
can
not
go
out
to
the
door
or
gather
a
flower
without
seeing
it
and
at
night
there
it
is
in
the
moonlight
so
naturally
we
are
better
acquainted
with
what
happens
than
anybody
else
can
be
and
do
you
really
really
believe
in
the
light
said
marjorie
ellermore
lay
quite
at
the
other
end
of
the
great
loch
among
another
range
of
hills
and
was
shut
out
from
personal
acquaintance
with
the
phenomena
of
kinloch
houran
colin
gave
a
slight
laugh
the
faintest
possible
indication
of
incredulity
to
repeat
with
an
increase
of
force
the
doubt
in
his
sister
tone
oona
was
not
without
a
healthful
little
temper
which
showed
in
the
flash
of
her
eye
and
the
reddening
of
her
cheek
but
she
answered
very
steadily
with
much
suppressed
feeling
in
her
tone
what
do
you
call
believing
she
said
you
believe
in
things
you
can
not
see
then
i
do
believe
in
the
kinloch
houran
light
because
i
see
it
and
have
seen
it
a
hundred
times
as
clear
as
day
at
this
there
was
a
little
pause
among
the
party
of
visitors
that
pause
of
superiority
and
scepticism
with
which
all
believers
in
the
mysterious
are
acquainted
and
then
marjorie
who
was
the
boldest
replied
papa
says
it
is
a
sort
of
phosphorescence
which
is
quite
explainable
and
that
where
there
is
so
much
decaying
matter
and
so
much
damp
and
so
much
faith
perhaps
said
colin
with
that
slight
laugh
but
we
are
outsiders
and
we
have
no
right
to
interfere
with
the
doctrines
of
the
loch
oona
give
us
that
credit
that
we
are
outside
the
circle
and
you
must
not
send
us
to
the
stake
oh
my
dears
said
forrester
and
that
is
quite
true
i
have
heard
very
clever
men
say
that
there
was
nothing
made
so
much
difference
in
what
you
believed
as
just
the
place
you
were
born
in
and
that
people
would
go
the
stake
as
you
say
on
one
side
of
the
border
for
a
thing
they
just
laughed
at
on
the
other
this
which
was
a
very
profound
deliverance
for
forrester
she
carried
off
at
the
end
with
a
pretty
profession
of
her
own
disabilities
i
never
trust
to
my
own
judgment
she
said
but
oona
is
just
very
decided
on
the
subject
and
so
are
all
our
people
on
the
isle
and
i
never
put
myself
forward
one
way
or
another
are
you
sure
you
will
not
take
a
cup
of
tea
before
you
go
a
cup
of
tea
is
never
out
of
place
it
is
true
that
the
day
is
very
short
and
colin
after
his
town
life
will
be
out
of
the
way
of
rowing
you
are
just
going
across
by
the
ferry
and
then
driving
well
that
is
perhaps
the
best
way
and
in
that
case
there
is
plenty
of
time
for
a
cup
of
tea
just
ring
the
bell
or
perhaps
it
will
be
safer
oona
if
you
will
cry
upon
mysie
and
tell
her
to
lose
no
time
just
the
tea
and
a
few
of
the
cream
scones
and
a
little
cake
she
need
not
spread
the
table
as
there
is
so
little
time
the
interlude
of
the
tea
and
the
cream
scones
made
it
late
before
the
visitors
got
away
their
waggonette
was
visible
waiting
for
them
on
the
road
below
auchnasheen
and
five
minutes
were
enough
to
get
them
across
so
that
they
dallied
over
this
refreshment
with
little
thought
of
the
waning
afternoon
then
there
was
a
little
bustle
to
escort
them
down
to
the
beach
to
see
them
carefully
wrapped
up
to
persuade
marjorie
that
another
hap
would
be
desirable
and
janet
that
her
cloud
should
be
twisted
once
more
about
her
throat
the
sunset
was
waning
when
at
last
they
were
fairly
off
and
the
loch
lay
in
a
still
yellow
radiance
against
which
every
tree
and
twig
every
rock
and
stone
stood
out
dark
in
full
significance
of
outline
it
was
cold
and
forrester
shivered
in
her
furred
cloak
the
shore
looks
so
near
that
you
could
touch
it
she
said
there
will
be
rain
oona
what
does
it
matter
about
cried
the
girl
it
beautiful
go
in
mamma
to
the
fireside
but
i
will
stay
here
and
see
them
drive
away
the
mother
consented
to
this
arrangement
which
was
so
natural
but
a
moment
afterwards
came
back
and
called
from
the
porch
where
she
stood
sheltered
from
the
keen
and
eager
air
oona
come
in
my
dear
that
colin
one
with
his
london
ways
will
think
you
are
watching
him
there
was
something
sublime
in
the
fling
of
oona
head
and
the
erection
of
her
slim
figure
as
she
rejected
the
possibility
watching
she
was
too
proud
even
to
permit
herself
to
resent
it
ah
but
you
never
can
tell
what
a
silly
lad
may
take
into
his
head
said
forrester
and
having
thus
cleared
her
conscience
she
went
in
and
took
off
her
cloak
and
shut
the
door
and
made
herself
very
comfortable
in
her
own
cosy
chair
in
the
ruddy
firelight
she
laid
her
head
back
upon
the
soft
cushions
and
looked
round
her
with
a
quiet
sense
of
content
everything
was
so
comfortable
so
pretty
and
homelike
and
she
permitted
herself
for
ten
minutes
or
so
to
fall
into
a
soft
oblivion
i
just
closed
my
eyes
was
little
euphemism
to
herself
meanwhile
oona
stood
and
looked
at
sky
and
sea
and
shore
the
soft
plash
of
the
oars
came
through
the
great
stillness
and
there
was
the
sound
of
the
boat
run
up
upon
the
shingle
and
the
noise
of
the
disembarkation
the
voices
swelling
out
in
louder
tones
and
laughter
as
they
waved
their
hands
in
a
final
to
the
watcher
on
the
isle
before
they
drove
away
the
young
people
as
forrester
had
said
laughed
and
assured
colin
that
it
was
not
for
them
oona
stood
out
in
the
evening
chill
but
as
a
matter
of
fact
there
was
nothing
so
little
in
oona
mind
she
was
looking
round
her
with
that
sort
of
exaltation
which
great
loneliness
and
stillness
and
natural
beauty
so
naturally
give
the
water
gleaming
all
round
the
sky
losing
its
orange
glow
and
melting
into
soft
primrose
tints
the
colour
of
the
daffodil
the
holy
time
is
quiet
as
a
nun
breathless
with
adoration
all
the
sensations
that
belong
to
such
a
moment
are
exquisite
a
visionary
elevation
above
the
earth
and
all
things
earthly
a
soft
pensiveness
an
elation
yet
wistful
longing
of
the
soul
before
her
the
old
castle
of
kinloch
houran
lay
gloomy
and
dark
on
the
edge
of
the
water
if
she
thought
of
anything
it
was
of
the
young
neighbour
to
whom
she
felt
so
strangely
near
in
wonder
and
sympathy
who
might
be
with
him
at
that
moment
in
the
ghostly
quiet
what
thoughts
what
suggestions
were
being
placed
before
him
oona
put
her
hands
together
and
breathed
into
the
still
air
a
wish
of
wondering
and
wistful
pity
which
was
almost
a
prayer
and
then
rousing
herself
with
a
slight
shiver
and
shake
she
turned
and
went
in
shutting
out
behind
her
the
lingering
glory
of
the
water
and
sky
mysie
was
lighting
the
candles
when
she
went
in
and
forrester
had
opened
her
eyes
two
candles
on
the
mantelpiece
and
two
on
the
table
were
all
the
ladies
allowed
themselves
except
on
great
occasions
when
the
argand
lamp
which
was
the
pride
of
the
household
was
lighted
in
honour
of
a
visitor
the
warmth
of
this
genial
interior
was
very
welcome
after
the
cold
of
the
twilight
and
oona
brought
her
work
to
the
table
and
the
book
from
which
her
mother
was
in
the
habit
of
reading
aloud
forrester
thought
she
improved
her
daughter
mind
by
these
readings
but
to
tell
the
truth
oona
young
soul
with
all
the
world
and
life
yet
before
it
often
fled
far
enough
away
while
her
soft
voice
with
the
pretty
tricks
of
elocution
which
were
part
of
her
training
went
on
never
was
there
a
prettier
indoor
scene
in
the
midst
of
that
great
solitude
of
woods
and
water
the
genial
comfort
of
this
feminine
room
so
warm
so
softly
lighted
so
peaceful
and
serene
struck
the
imagination
like
a
miracle
such
a
tranquil
retirement
would
have
been
natural
enough
safely
planted
amid
the
safeguards
and
peaceful
surroundings
of
a
village
but
in
being
here
there
was
a
touching
incongruity
the
little
play
of
the
mother
voice
as
she
read
with
innocent
artifice
and
the
simple
vanity
which
belonged
to
her
the
pretty
work
of
no
great
use
with
which
the
girl
was
busy
both
heightened
the
sense
of
absolute
trust
with
which
they
lived
in
the
bosom
of
nature
a
sudden
storm
one
could
not
but
think
might
have
swept
them
away
into
the
dark
gleaming
water
that
hemmed
them
round
they
were
not
afraid
they
were
as
safe
as
in
a
citadel
they
were
like
the
birds
in
their
nests
warm
and
soft
though
in
the
heart
of
loch
houran
forrester
was
reading
a
historical
novel
one
of
the
kind
which
she
thought
so
good
for
improving
oona
mind
amusing
yet
instructing
her
but
oona
mind
refusing
to
be
improved
was
giving
only
a
mechanical
attention
it
was
away
making
a
little
pilgrimage
of
wonder
about
the
mystic
house
which
was
so
near
them
longing
to
know
and
trying
to
divine
what
was
going
on
there
but
when
the
afternoon
closes
in
at
four
and
the
candles
are
lighted
shortly
after
the
night
is
long
it
seemed
endless
on
this
occasion
because
of
the
too
early
tea
which
forrester
had
thought
it
would
be
just
a
farce
to
produce
again
at
six
their
usual
hour
and
from
four
till
nine
when
the
small
and
light
repast
known
in
the
house
under
the
pleasantly
indefinite
name
of
the
tray
made
its
appearance
is
a
long
time
there
had
been
two
or
three
interruptions
of
a
little
talk
and
the
book
had
been
laid
down
and
resumed
again
and
oona
work
had
dropped
two
or
three
times
upon
her
knee
when
mysie
coming
in
announced
that
it
was
just
an
uncommon
fine
night
though
all
the
signs
including
the
glass
which
however
does
not
always
count
in
the
west
of
scotland
pointed
to
rain
and
that
hamish
was
going
to
take
advantage
of
the
moonlight
to
do
an
errand
at
the
village
above
auchnasheen
would
miss
oona
like
to
go
it
was
just
awfu
bonny
and
with
plenty
of
haps
she
could
take
no
harm
mysie
said
to
see
how
the
girl
sprang
from
her
seat
was
a
proof
of
the
gentle
tedium
that
had
stolen
upon
her
soul
but
my
dear
it
will
be
cold
cold
i
am
afraid
of
you
catching
cold
oona
forrester
cried
oh
mother
no
i
never
catch
cold
and
besides
if
i
did
what
would
it
matter
tell
him
i
coming
mysie
tell
him
to
wait
for
me
i
put
on
my
thick
ulster
or
the
fur
cloak
if
you
like
certainly
the
fur
cloak
oona
i
will
not
hear
of
it
without
that
but
my
dear
just
think
hamish
will
have
to
leave
you
in
the
boat
while
he
goes
to
the
village
and
what
would
you
do
oona
if
there
is
any
one
on
the
road
do
mamma
look
at
them
to
see
if
i
knew
them
and
if
it
was
a
stranger
just
sit
still
and
say
nothing
but
my
dear
it
might
be
somebody
that
would
speak
to
you
and
annoy
you
oona
there
is
no
person
up
the
loch
or
down
the
loch
that
would
dare
to
do
that
mem
said
mysie
composedly
how
can
we
tell
it
might
be
some
tourist
or
gangrel
body
annoy
said
oona
as
if
indeed
this
suggestion
was
too
for
possibility
if
anything
so
ridiculous
happened
i
would
just
push
out
into
the
loch
do
you
trouble
mother
about
me
forrester
got
up
to
envelop
her
child
throat
in
fold
after
fold
of
the
fleecy
white
cloud
she
shook
her
head
a
little
but
she
was
resigned
for
such
little
controversies
occurred
almost
daily
the
evening
had
changed
when
oona
ran
lightly
down
the
bank
to
the
boat
in
which
hamish
was
waiting
everything
about
was
flooded
with
the
keen
clear
white
moonlight
which
in
its
penetrating
chilly
fashion
was
almost
more
light
than
day
the
loch
was
shining
like
silver
but
with
a
blackness
behind
the
shining
and
all
the
shadows
were
like
midnight
profound
in
inky
gloom
the
boat
seemed
to
hang
suspended
in
the
keen
atmosphere
rather
than
to
float
and
the
silence
was
shrill
and
seemed
to
cut
into
the
soul
it
was
but
a
few
minutes
across
the
cold
white
glittering
strait
that
lay
between
the
isle
and
the
mainland
hamish
jumped
out
with
an
exaggerated
noise
upon
the
slippery
shingle
and
fastened
the
boat
with
a
rattle
of
the
ring
to
which
it
was
attached
which
woke
echoes
all
around
both
from
land
and
water
everything
under
the
mingled
influence
of
winter
and
night
being
so
still
a
chance
spectator
would
have
thought
that
the
mother
had
very
good
cause
for
her
alarm
and
that
to
sit
there
in
the
rough
boat
absolutely
alone
like
the
one
living
atom
in
a
world
all
voiceless
and
asleep
was
not
a
cheerful
amusement
for
a
girl
but
oona
had
neither
fear
nor
sense
of
strangeness
in
an
experience
which
she
had
gone
through
so
often
she
called
out
lightly
to
hamish
to
make
haste
and
looked
after
him
as
he
set
out
on
the
white
road
the
peculiarities
of
his
figure
coming
out
drolly
in
the
curious
dab
of
foreshortened
shadow
flung
upon
the
road
by
his
side
she
laughed
at
this
to
herself
and
the
laugh
ran
all
about
with
a
wonderful
cheerful
thrill
of
the
silence
how
still
it
was
when
her
laugh
ceased
there
was
nothing
but
the
steps
of
hamish
in
all
the
world
and
by
and
by
even
the
steps
ceased
and
that
stillness
which
could
be
felt
settled
down
there
was
not
a
breath
astir
not
enough
to
cause
the
faintest
ripple
on
the
beach
now
and
then
a
pebble
which
had
been
pushed
out
of
its
place
by
the
man
foot
toppled
over
and
made
a
sound
as
if
something
great
had
fallen
otherwise
not
a
breath
was
stirring
the
shadows
of
the
looked
as
if
they
were
gummed
upon
the
road
and
oona
held
her
breath
it
seemed
almost
profane
to
disturb
the
intense
and
perfect
quiet
she
knew
every
hue
of
every
rock
and
the
profile
of
every
tree
and
presently
which
no
doubt
was
partly
because
of
this
perfect
acquaintance
and
partly
because
of
some
mesmeric
consciousness
in
the
air
such
as
almost
invariably
betrays
the
presence
of
a
human
being
her
eyes
fixed
upon
one
spot
where
the
rock
seemed
higher
than
she
had
been
used
to
was
it
possible
that
somebody
was
there
she
changed
her
place
to
look
more
closely
and
so
fearless
was
the
girl
that
she
had
nearly
jumped
out
of
the
boat
to
satisfy
herself
whether
it
was
a
man
or
a
rock
but
just
when
she
was
about
making
up
her
mind
to
do
so
the
figure
moved
and
came
down
towards
the
beach
oona
heart
gave
a
jump
several
stories
which
she
had
heard
from
her
childhood
came
into
her
mind
with
a
rush
she
took
the
end
of
the
rope
softly
in
her
hand
so
as
to
be
able
to
detach
it
in
a
moment
to
row
back
to
the
isle
was
easy
enough
is
it
you
miss
forrester
a
voice
said
oona
let
go
the
rope
and
her
heart
beat
more
calmly
i
might
with
more
reason
cry
out
is
it
you
lord
erradeen
for
if
you
are
at
the
old
castle
you
are
a
long
way
from
home
and
i
am
quite
near
i
am
at
auchnasheen
he
said
a
great
change
had
come
over
his
tone
it
was
very
grave
no
longer
the
airy
voice
of
youth
which
had
jested
and
laughed
on
the
isle
he
came
down
and
stood
with
his
hand
on
the
bow
of
the
boat
he
looked
very
pale
very
serious
but
that
might
be
only
the
blackness
of
the
shadows
and
the
whiteness
of
the
light
did
you
ever
see
so
spiritual
a
night
said
oona
there
might
be
anything
abroad
not
fairies
who
belong
to
summer
but
serious
things
do
you
believe
then
in
ghosts
he
said
ghosts
is
an
injurious
phrase
why
should
we
call
the
poor
people
so
who
are
only
dead
said
oona
but
that
is
a
false
way
of
speaking
too
is
it
for
it
is
not
because
they
are
dead
but
living
that
they
come
back
i
am
no
judge
he
said
with
a
little
shiver
i
never
have
thought
on
the
subject
i
suppose
superstition
lingers
longer
up
among
the
mountains
superstition
said
oona
with
a
laugh
what
ugly
words
you
use
once
more
the
laugh
seemed
to
ripple
about
and
break
the
solemnity
of
the
night
but
young
lord
erradeen
was
as
solemn
as
the
night
and
his
countenance
was
not
touched
even
by
a
responsive
smile
his
gravity
produced
upon
the
girl
mind
that
feeling
of
visionary
panic
and
distrust
which
had
not
been
roused
by
the
external
circumstances
she
felt
herself
grow
solemn
too
but
struggled
against
it
hamish
has
gone
up
with
some
mysterious
communication
to
the
she
said
and
in
these
long
nights
one
is
glad
of
a
little
change
i
came
out
with
him
to
keep
myself
from
going
to
sleep
which
was
not
perhaps
exactly
true
but
there
had
arisen
a
little
embarrassment
in
her
mind
and
she
wanted
something
to
say
and
i
came
out
he
said
then
paused
the
night
is
not
so
ghostly
as
the
day
he
added
hurriedly
nor
dead
people
so
alarming
as
the
living
you
mean
that
you
disapprove
of
our
superstitions
as
you
call
them
said
oona
most
people
laugh
and
believe
a
little
but
i
know
some
are
angry
and
think
it
wrong
i
angry
that
was
not
what
i
meant
i
meant
it
is
a
strange
question
which
is
living
and
which
is
to
be
sure
you
are
right
miss
forrester
what
is
dead
can
not
come
in
contact
with
us
only
what
is
living
it
is
a
mystery
altogether
you
are
not
a
sceptic
then
said
oona
i
am
glad
of
that
i
am
not
anything
i
do
know
how
to
form
an
opinion
how
lovely
it
is
to
be
sure
he
burst
out
all
at
once
especially
to
have
some
one
to
talk
to
that
is
the
great
charm
if
that
is
all
said
oona
trying
to
speak
cheerfully
you
will
soon
have
dozens
of
people
to
talk
to
for
everybody
in
the
county
and
that
is
a
wide
word
is
coming
to
call
they
will
arrive
in
shoals
as
soon
as
they
know
i
think
i
shall
go
in
a
day
or
two
he
said
at
this
moment
the
step
of
hamish
heard
far
off
through
the
great
stillness
interrupted
the
conversation
it
had
been
as
if
they
two
were
alone
in
this
silent
world
and
the
step
brought
in
a
third
and
disturbed
them
they
were
silent
listening
as
it
came
nearer
and
nearer
the
sound
growing
with
every
repetition
when
hamish
appeared
in
the
broad
white
band
of
road
coming
from
between
the
shadows
of
the
trees
the
young
man
dropped
his
hand
from
the
bow
of
the
boat
he
had
not
spoken
again
nor
did
oona
feel
herself
disposed
to
speak
hamish
quickened
his
pace
when
he
saw
another
figure
on
the
beach
ye
no
have
been
crying
upon
me
miss
oona
he
said
with
a
suspicious
look
at
the
stranger
oh
no
hamish
cried
oona
cheerfully
i
have
not
been
wearying
at
all
for
this
is
lord
erradeen
that
has
been
so
kind
as
to
come
and
keep
me
company
oh
it
be
my
lord
erradeen
said
hamish
with
a
curious
look
into
walter
face
then
there
was
a
repetition
of
the
noises
with
which
the
still
loch
rang
the
rattle
of
the
iron
ring
the
grating
of
the
bow
on
the
shingle
as
she
was
pushed
off
hamish
left
no
time
for
there
were
a
few
yards
of
clear
water
between
the
boat
and
the
beach
when
oona
waved
her
hand
to
the
still
figure
left
behind
my
mother
will
like
to
see
you
she
cried
with
an
impulse
of
sympathy
good
night
he
took
his
hat
off
and
waved
his
hand
in
reply
but
said
nothing
and
stood
motionless
till
they
lost
sight
of
him
round
the
corner
of
the
isle
then
hamish
who
had
been
exerting
himself
more
than
usual
paused
a
little
miss
oona
he
said
yon
will
maybe
be
the
young
lord
but
maybe
no
i
would
not
be
speaking
to
the
first
that
comes
upon
the
loch
side
oh
if
you
are
beginning
to
preach
propriety
the
girl
cried
it
not
be
propriety
it
will
just
be
that
they
a
family
that
is
not
canny
who
will
tell
you
if
it
one
or
if
it
the
other
did
ye
never
hear
the
tale
of
the
leddy
that
fell
off
the
castle
wall
but
this
is
not
the
castle
cried
oona
and
i
know
him
very
well
and
i
sorry
for
him
hamish
he
looks
so
changed
oh
what
would
you
do
being
sorry
for
him
he
has
nothing
ado
with
us
nothing
ado
with
us
hamish
said
and
how
strange
it
was
to
come
in
again
from
that
brilliant
whiteness
and
silence
the
ghostly
loch
the
visionary
night
into
the
ruddy
room
full
of
firelight
and
warmth
all
shut
in
sheltered
full
of
companionship
come
away
come
away
to
the
fire
you
must
be
nearly
frozen
oona
and
i
fear
ye
have
caught
your
death
of
cold
her
mother
said
oona
remembered
with
a
pang
the
solitary
figure
on
the
water
edge
and
wondered
if
he
were
still
standing
there
forlorn
a
whole
chapter
of
life
seemed
to
have
interposed
between
her
going
and
coming
though
she
had
been
but
half
an
hour
away
chapter
xiv
two
days
after
this
night
scene
there
was
a
gathering
such
as
was
of
weekly
occurrence
in
the
manse
of
loch
houran
parish
the
houses
were
far
apart
and
those
of
the
gentry
who
were
enough
to
remain
for
the
second
service
were
in
the
habit
of
spending
the
short
interval
between
in
the
minister
house
where
an
abundant
meal
called
by
his
housekeeper
a
cold
collation
was
spread
in
the
for
whosoever
chose
to
partake
as
it
was
the
fashion
in
the
country
to
dine
early
on
sunday
this
repast
was
but
sparingly
partaken
of
and
most
of
the
company
after
the
glass
of
wine
or
milk
the
sandwich
or
biscuit
which
was
all
they
cared
to
take
would
sit
round
the
fire
in
the
minister
library
or
examine
his
books
or
what
was
still
more
prized
talk
to
him
of
their
own
or
their
neighbours
affairs
the
minister
of
loch
houran
was
one
of
those
celibates
who
are
always
powerful
ecclesiastically
though
the
modern
mind
is
so
strongly
opposed
to
any
artificial
manufacture
of
them
such
as
that
which
the
church
of
rome
in
her
wisdom
has
thought
expedient
we
all
know
the
arguments
in
favour
of
a
married
clergy
but
those
on
the
other
side
of
the
question
it
is
the
fashion
to
ignore
he
who
has
kept
this
natural
distinction
by
fair
means
and
without
compulsion
has
however
an
unforced
advantage
of
his
own
which
the
most
protestant
and
the
most
matrimonial
of
polemics
will
scarcely
deny
he
is
more
safe
to
confide
in
being
one
not
two
he
is
more
detached
and
individual
it
is
more
natural
that
all
the
world
about
him
should
have
a
closer
claim
upon
the
man
who
has
no
nearer
claims
to
rival
those
of
his
spiritual
children
cameron
was
one
of
this
natural
priesthood
if
he
had
come
to
his
present
calm
by
reason
of
passion
and
disappointment
in
his
past
such
as
we
obstinately
and
romantically
hope
to
have
founded
the
tranquillity
of
subdued
sunny
and
sober
age
nobody
could
tell
an
old
minister
may
perhaps
be
let
off
more
easily
in
this
respect
than
an
old
monk
but
he
was
the
friend
and
consoler
of
everybody
the
depositary
of
all
the
secrets
of
the
parish
the
one
adviser
of
whose
disinterestedness
and
secrecy
every
perplexed
individual
was
sure
he
did
all
that
man
could
do
to
be
absolutely
impartial
and
divide
himself
as
he
divided
his
provisions
among
his
guests
as
their
needs
required
but
flesh
is
weak
and
cameron
could
not
disown
one
soft
place
in
his
heart
for
oona
forrester
of
which
that
young
person
was
quite
aware
oona
was
his
pupil
and
his
favourite
and
he
was
if
not
her
spiritual
director
which
is
a
position
officially
unknown
to
his
church
at
least
her
confidant
in
all
her
little
difficulties
which
comes
to
much
the
same
thing
and
this
notwithstanding
the
fact
that
forrester
attended
the
parish
church
under
protest
and
prided
herself
on
belonging
to
the
scottish
episcopal
community
the
church
of
the
gentry
though
debarred
by
providence
from
her
privileges
forrester
at
this
moment
with
her
feet
on
the
fender
was
employed
in
bewailing
this
sad
circumstance
with
another
landed
lady
in
the
same
position
but
oona
was
standing
by
the
old
ministers
side
with
her
hand
laid
lightly
within
his
arm
which
was
a
pretty
way
she
had
when
she
was
with
her
oldest
friend
it
did
not
interfere
with
this
attitude
that
he
was
exchanging
various
remarks
with
other
people
and
scarcely
talking
to
oona
at
all
he
looked
down
upon
her
from
time
to
time
with
a
sort
of
proud
tenderness
as
her
grandfather
might
have
done
it
pleased
the
old
man
to
feel
the
slim
small
fingers
upon
his
arm
and
as
there
were
no
secrets
discussed
in
this
weekly
assembly
her
presence
interrupted
nothing
she
added
her
word
from
time
to
time
or
the
still
readier
comment
of
smiles
and
varying
looks
that
changed
like
the
highland
sky
outside
and
were
never
for
two
minutes
the
same
it
was
not
however
till
shaw
the
factor
came
in
that
the
easy
superficial
interest
of
all
the
parish
talk
quickened
into
something
more
eager
and
warm
in
her
sympathetic
countenance
shaw
ruddy
face
was
full
of
care
this
was
indeed
its
usual
expression
an
expression
all
the
more
marked
from
the
blunt
and
open
simplicity
of
its
natural
mood
to
which
care
seemed
alien
the
puckers
about
his
hazel
grey
eyes
the
lines
on
his
forehead
which
exposure
to
the
air
had
reddened
rather
than
browned
were
more
than
usually
evident
those
honest
eyes
seemed
to
be
remonstrating
with
the
world
and
fate
they
had
an
appearance
to
the
spectator
but
by
no
means
comic
to
their
own
consciousness
of
grieved
interrogation
as
if
asking
every
one
on
whom
they
turned
why
did
you
do
it
why
did
you
let
it
be
done
it
was
this
look
which
he
fixed
upon
the
minister
who
indeed
was
most
innocent
of
all
share
in
the
cause
of
his
trouble
i
told
you
he
said
the
other
day
about
the
good
intentions
of
our
young
lord
i
left
various
things
with
him
to
be
settled
that
would
bide
no
delay
things
that
had
been
waiting
for
the
late
lord
erradeen
from
day
to
day
and
all
this
putting
off
has
been
bad
bad
there
those
poor
crofters
that
will
have
to
be
put
out
of
their
bits
of
places
i
can
hold
off
no
longer
without
his
lordship
warrant
and
not
a
word
from
him
not
a
word
cried
the
good
man
with
that
appealing
look
to
which
the
natural
reply
was
it
is
not
my
fault
but
the
minister
knew
better
and
returned
a
look
of
sympathy
shaking
his
white
head
what
has
become
of
the
young
man
they
tell
me
he
has
left
the
castle
he
is
not
far
off
he
is
at
auchnasheen
but
he
is
just
like
all
the
rest
full
of
goodwill
one
day
and
just
inaccessible
the
next
just
inaccessible
repeated
the
factor
and
what
am
i
to
do
i
am
just
wild
to
have
advice
from
somebody
what
am
i
to
do
can
you
not
get
at
him
to
speak
to
him
the
minister
asked
i
have
written
to
know
if
he
will
see
me
i
have
said
i
was
waiting
an
answer
but
there
no
answer
comes
they
say
he
on
the
hill
all
day
though
the
keepers
know
nothing
about
his
movements
and
he
does
not
even
carry
a
gun
what
am
i
to
do
he
sees
nobody
two
or
three
have
called
but
can
not
get
at
him
he
always
out
he
never
there
that
old
symington
goes
about
wringing
his
hands
what
says
he
he
says
is
the
worst
of
a
this
is
the
worst
of
a
he
just
got
it
on
him
what
does
that
mean
can
i
tell
what
that
means
according
to
the
old
wives
it
is
the
weird
of
the
methvens
but
you
do
believe
such
rubbish
nor
do
i
it
has
maybe
something
to
do
with
the
drainage
or
the
water
or
the
sanitary
arrangements
one
way
or
the
other
cried
the
factor
with
a
harsh
and
angry
laugh
then
there
was
a
momentary
pause
and
the
hum
of
the
other
people
talk
came
in
filling
up
with
easier
tones
of
conversation
the
somewhat
strained
feeling
of
this
he
a
good
shot
and
a
fine
oar
and
just
a
deevil
for
spunk
and
courage
and
yet
because
he
a
little
vague
in
his
speaking
but
i
say
we
must
put
up
with
what
we
can
get
and
though
it
a
trial
the
surplice
is
not
just
salvation
and
it
turned
out
to
be
measles
and
not
fever
at
all
and
nothing
to
speak
of
so
we
just
cheated
the
doctors
these
were
the
broken
scraps
that
came
in
to
fill
up
the
pause
i
saw
lord
erradeen
the
other
night
said
oona
whose
light
grasp
on
the
old
minister
arm
had
been
tightening
and
slackening
all
through
this
dialogue
in
the
interest
she
felt
both
of
the
gentlemen
turned
to
look
at
her
inquiringly
and
the
girl
blushed
not
for
any
reason
as
she
explained
to
herself
indignantly
afterwards
but
because
it
was
a
foolish
way
she
had
but
somehow
the
idea
suggested
to
all
their
minds
was
not
without
an
effect
upon
the
events
of
her
and
what
did
he
say
to
you
and
what
is
he
intending
and
why
does
he
shut
himself
up
and
let
all
the
business
hang
suspended
like
yon
fellow
machomet
coffin
cried
the
factor
with
a
guttural
in
the
name
which
was
due
to
the
energy
of
his
feelings
he
turned
upon
oona
those
remonstrating
eyes
of
his
as
if
he
had
at
last
come
to
the
final
cause
of
all
the
confusion
and
meant
to
demand
of
her
without
any
quibbling
an
answer
to
the
question
why
did
you
do
it
on
the
spot
indeed
he
said
very
little
to
me
shaw
he
looked
like
a
ghost
and
he
said
he
was
going
away
in
a
day
or
two
sudden
reflection
in
the
midst
of
what
she
was
saying
made
it
apparent
to
oona
that
it
was
unnecessary
to
give
all
the
details
of
the
interview
cameron
for
his
part
laid
his
large
soft
old
hand
tenderly
upon
hers
which
was
on
his
arm
and
said
in
the
voice
which
always
softened
when
he
addressed
her
and
where
would
that
be
my
bonnie
oona
that
you
met
with
lord
erradeen
it
was
on
the
beach
below
auchnasheen
said
oona
with
an
almost
indignant
frankness
holding
her
head
high
but
feeling
to
her
anger
and
distress
the
blush
burn
upon
her
cheek
hamish
had
some
errand
on
shore
and
i
went
with
him
in
the
boat
i
was
waiting
for
him
when
some
one
came
down
from
the
road
and
spoke
to
me
i
was
for
i
did
not
know
any
one
was
there
it
was
lord
erradeen
and
what
and
why
and
the
factor
was
too
much
disturbed
to
form
his
questions
reasonably
even
putting
aside
the
evident
fact
that
oona
had
no
answer
to
give
him
but
at
this
moment
the
little
cracked
bell
began
to
sound
which
was
the
warning
that
the
hour
of
afternoon
service
approached
the
ladies
rose
from
their
seats
round
the
fire
the
little
knots
of
men
broke
up
oona
my
dear
will
ye
come
and
tie
my
bonnet
i
never
was
clever
at
making
a
bow
said
forrester
and
the
minister
left
his
guests
to
make
his
preparations
for
church
shaw
felt
himself
left
in
the
lurch
he
kept
hovering
about
oona
with
a
quick
decision
in
his
own
mind
which
was
totally
unjustified
by
any
foundation
he
went
summarily
through
a
whole
romance
and
came
to
its
conclusion
in
the
most
and
expeditious
way
if
that
comes
to
pass
now
he
said
to
himself
no
there
no
weird
on
her
he
can
give
her
the
management
of
the
estates
and
all
will
go
well
she
has
a
head
upon
her
shoulders
though
she
is
nothing
but
a
bit
girlie
and
there
will
be
me
to
make
everything
plain
such
was
the
brief
epitome
of
the
situation
that
passed
in
the
factor
mind
he
was
very
anxious
to
get
speech
of
oona
on
the
way
to
church
and
it
is
to
be
feared
that
cameron
excellent
afternoon
discourse
which
many
people
said
was
always
his
best
though
as
it
was
listened
to
but
drowsily
the
fact
may
be
doubted
made
little
impression
upon
shaw
though
he
was
a
serious
man
who
could
say
his
say
upon
religious
subjects
and
was
an
elder
and
had
sat
in
the
assembly
in
his
day
he
had
his
opportunity
when
the
service
was
over
when
the
boats
were
being
pushed
off
from
the
beach
and
the
carriages
got
under
way
for
those
who
had
far
to
go
forrester
had
a
great
many
last
words
to
say
before
she
put
on
her
furred
mantle
and
her
white
cloud
and
took
her
place
in
the
boat
and
mysie
who
stood
ready
with
the
mantle
to
place
it
on
her
shoulders
had
also
her
own
little
talks
to
carry
on
at
that
genial
moment
when
all
the
parish
or
all
the
loch
if
you
like
the
expression
better
stood
about
exchanging
friendly
greetings
and
news
from
outlying
places
while
all
the
world
was
thus
engaged
oona
fell
at
last
into
the
hands
of
the
factor
and
became
his
prey
miss
oona
he
said
if
ye
will
accord
me
a
moment
i
would
like
well
well
to
know
what
your
opinion
about
lord
erradeen
but
i
have
no
opinion
cried
oona
who
had
been
prepared
for
the
attack
she
could
not
keep
herself
from
blushing
so
ridiculous
but
i
will
do
it
she
said
to
herself
as
if
that
i
was
an
independent
person
over
whom
she
had
no
control
but
otherwise
she
was
on
her
guard
how
could
i
have
any
opinion
when
i
have
only
seen
lord
erradeen
twice
thrice
she
added
with
a
heightening
of
the
blush
as
she
remembered
the
adventure
of
the
coach
twice
thrice
but
that
gives
you
facilities
and
ladies
are
so
i
seen
him
but
once
said
the
factor
i
was
much
taken
with
him
that
is
the
truth
and
was
so
rash
as
to
think
our
troubles
were
over
but
here
has
everything
fallen
to
confusion
in
the
old
way
miss
oona
do
you
use
your
influence
if
you
should
see
his
lordship
again
but
shaw
there
is
no
likelihood
that
i
shall
see
him
again
and
i
have
no
influence
oh
no
you
not
tell
me
that
said
the
factor
shaking
his
head
with
a
troubled
smile
them
that
are
like
you
young
and
bonnie
have
always
influence
if
they
like
to
use
it
and
as
for
seeing
him
again
he
will
never
leave
the
place
miss
oona
without
going
at
least
to
bid
you
lord
erradeen
may
come
to
take
leave
of
my
mother
said
oona
with
dignity
it
is
possible
though
he
did
not
say
so
but
even
if
he
does
what
can
i
do
i
know
nothing
about
his
affairs
and
i
have
no
right
to
say
anything
to
him
no
right
more
than
any
one
else
who
has
met
him
three
times
which
is
just
no
person
except
yourself
so
far
as
i
can
learn
the
factor
said
after
all
when
you
come
to
think
of
it
it
is
only
once
i
have
seen
him
said
oona
for
the
night
on
the
loch
was
by
chance
and
the
day
on
the
coach
i
did
not
know
him
so
that
after
all
i
have
only
so
to
speak
seen
him
once
and
how
could
i
venture
to
speak
to
him
about
business
oh
no
that
is
out
of
the
question
yes
mamma
i
am
quite
ready
shaw
wishes
if
lord
erradeen
comes
to
bid
us
that
we
should
tell
him
yes
said
forrester
briskly
coming
forward
while
mysie
arranged
around
her
her
heavy
cloak
i
am
sure
i
shall
be
very
glad
to
give
lord
erradeen
any
message
he
is
a
very
nice
young
man
so
far
as
i
can
judge
people
think
him
very
like
my
ronald
shaw
perhaps
it
has
not
struck
you
for
likenesses
are
just
one
of
the
things
that
no
two
people
see
but
we
are
very
good
friends
him
and
me
he
is
just
a
nice
simple
gentlemanly
young
man
oh
very
gentlemanly
he
would
never
go
away
without
saying
and
i
am
sure
i
shall
be
delighted
to
give
him
any
message
that
will
do
mysie
that
will
do
do
not
suffocate
me
with
that
cloak
dear
me
you
have
scarcely
left
me
a
corner
to
breathe
out
of
but
shaw
certainly
any
message
i
am
much
obliged
to
you
but
i
will
no
doubt
see
lord
erradeen
myself
and
i
not
trouble
a
lady
about
business
said
the
factor
he
cast
a
look
at
oona
in
which
with
more
reason
than
usual
his
eyes
said
how
could
you
do
it
and
the
girl
was
a
little
compunctious
she
laughed
but
she
felt
guilty
as
she
took
her
mother
arm
to
lead
her
to
the
boat
forrester
had
still
a
dozen
things
to
say
and
waved
her
hands
to
the
departing
groups
on
every
side
while
shaw
stood
grimly
watching
the
embarkation
there
are
the
kilhouran
campbells
driving
away
and
i
have
not
had
a
word
with
them
and
there
is
old
jess
who
always
expects
to
be
taken
notice
of
and
the
ellermore
folk
that
i
had
no
time
to
ask
about
examination
and
cameron
himself
that
i
never
got
a
chance
of
telling
how
well
i
liked
the
sermon
dear
me
oona
you
are
always
in
such
a
hurry
and
take
care
now
take
care
one
would
think
you
took
me
for
your
own
age
but
i
am
not
wanting
to
be
hoisted
up
either
as
if
i
were
too
old
to
know
how
to
step
into
a
boat
shaw
forrester
added
cheerfully
waving
her
hand
as
she
got
herself
safely
established
in
the
bow
and
hamish
not
half
so
picturesque
as
usual
in
his
sunday
clothes
pushed
off
the
boat
and
i
not
forget
your
message
she
even
kissed
her
hand
if
not
to
him
to
the
parish
in
general
in
the
friendliness
of
her
heart
shaw
had
very
nearly
shaken
his
clenched
fist
in
reply
old
fool
he
called
her
in
his
heart
and
even
launched
an
expletive
silently
at
oona
the
heartless
monkey
who
had
betrayed
him
to
her
mother
he
went
back
to
the
manse
with
cameron
when
all
the
little
talks
and
consultations
were
over
and
everybody
gone
and
once
more
poured
out
the
story
of
his
perplexities
if
i
do
not
hear
from
him
i
have
to
proceed
to
extremities
and
it
is
like
to
break
my
heart
he
said
for
the
poor
folk
have
got
into
their
heads
that
i
will
stand
their
friend
whatever
happens
and
they
are
just
keeping
their
minds
easy
but
man
they
should
pay
their
rents
said
cameron
who
when
all
was
said
that
could
be
said
in
his
favour
was
not
a
loch
houran
man
rents
where
would
you
have
them
get
the
siller
their
bit
harvest
has
failed
and
the
cows
are
dry
for
want
of
fodder
if
they
have
a
penny
laid
by
they
must
take
it
to
live
upon
they
have
enough
ado
to
live
without
thinking
of
rents
but
in
that
case
shaw
said
the
minister
gravely
you
must
not
blame
me
for
saying
so
it
what
all
the
wise
men
say
would
they
not
do
better
to
emigrate
and
make
a
new
start
in
a
new
country
where
there
plenty
of
room
oh
i
know
that
argument
very
well
said
shaw
with
a
snort
of
indignation
i
have
it
all
at
my
fingers
ends
i
preached
it
many
a
day
but
what
does
it
mean
when
all
done
it
means
just
sheep
or
it
means
deer
and
a
pickle
roofless
houses
standing
here
and
there
and
not
a
soul
in
the
glen
there
was
a
time
even
when
i
had
just
an
enthusiasm
for
it
and
i
sent
away
as
many
as
most
but
after
all
they
harmless
folk
the
land
is
the
better
of
them
and
none
the
worse
there
john
paterson
has
had
great
losses
with
his
sheep
and
there
yon
english
loon
that
had
the
shooting
and
shot
every
feather
on
the
place
both
the
one
and
the
other
will
be
far
more
out
of
his
lordship
pocket
than
my
poor
bit
crofters
i
laid
all
that
before
him
and
he
showed
a
manful
spirit
that
i
will
always
say
no
minister
it
was
not
to
argue
the
case
from
its
foundations
that
i
came
to
you
i
know
very
well
what
the
economists
say
i
think
they
not
more
than
half
right
though
they
so
cocksure
but
if
you
tell
me
what
i
should
do
this
however
was
what
cameron
was
not
capable
of
he
said
after
an
interval
i
will
go
and
try
if
i
can
see
him
if
you
think
it
would
not
be
ill
taken
is
the
last
day
said
the
factor
gloomily
and
after
a
little
while
he
followed
the
example
of
all
the
others
and
sent
for
his
and
drove
himself
away
but
a
more
anxious
man
did
not
traverse
any
road
in
great
britain
on
that
wintry
afternoon
and
bitter
thoughts
were
in
his
heart
of
the
capricious
family
whose
interests
were
in
his
hands
and
to
whom
he
was
almost
too
faithful
a
servant
oh
the
weird
of
the
said
shaw
to
himself
if
they
were
not
so
taken
up
with
themselves
and
took
more
thought
for
other
folk
we
would
hear
little
of
any
weirds
i
have
no
time
for
weirds
i
have
just
my
work
to
do
and
i
do
it
the
lord
preserve
us
from
idleness
and
luxury
and
occupation
with
ourselves
here
the
good
man
in
his
righteous
wrath
and
trouble
and
disappointment
was
unjust
as
many
a
good
man
has
been
before
when
hamish
had
pushed
off
from
the
beach
and
the
little
party
were
afloat
oona
repented
her
of
that
movement
of
mingled
offence
and
which
had
made
her
transfer
the
factor
appeal
from
herself
to
her
mother
and
it
was
only
then
that
forrester
recollected
how
imperfect
the
communication
was
bless
me
forrester
said
i
forgot
to
ask
after
all
what
it
was
he
wanted
me
to
say
that
was
a
daft
like
thing
to
charge
me
with
a
message
and
never
to
tell
me
what
it
was
and
how
can
i
tell
my
lord
erradeen
i
suppose
you
could
not
put
back
hamish
to
inquire
but
there
nobody
left
yonder
at
the
landing
that
i
can
see
so
it
would
be
little
use
how
could
you
let
me
do
such
a
silly
thing
oona
my
dear
most
likely
mamma
we
shall
not
see
lord
erradeen
and
so
no
harm
will
be
done
not
see
lord
erradeen
do
ye
think
then
oona
that
he
has
no
manners
or
that
he
ignorant
how
to
behave
i
wonder
what
has
made
ye
take
an
at
such
a
nice
young
man
there
was
nothing
in
him
to
justify
it
that
i
could
see
and
to
think
i
should
have
a
message
for
him
and
not
know
what
it
is
how
am
i
to
give
him
the
message
when
it
was
never
given
to
me
i
just
never
heard
of
such
a
dilemma
something
perhaps
of
importance
and
me
charged
to
give
it
and
not
to
know
what
it
was
maybe
mem
said
mysie
from
the
other
end
of
the
boat
with
that
serene
certainty
that
her
mistress
affairs
were
her
own
which
distinguishes
an
old
scotch
family
retainer
maybe
miss
oona
will
ken
oh
yes
i
suppose
i
know
said
oona
reluctantly
it
is
something
about
the
cotters
at
the
who
will
be
turned
out
unless
lord
erradeen
interferes
but
why
should
we
be
charged
with
that
we
are
very
unlikely
to
see
lord
erradeen
and
is
the
day
this
piece
of
information
caused
a
great
excitement
in
the
little
party
the
cotters
to
be
turned
out
but
no
no
that
was
just
to
frighten
you
he
will
never
do
it
said
forrester
putting
on
a
smile
to
reassure
herself
after
a
great
flutter
and
outcry
no
no
it
must
just
have
been
to
give
us
all
a
fright
john
shaw
is
a
very
decent
man
i
knew
his
father
perfectly
well
who
was
the
minister
at
rannoch
and
a
very
good
preacher
no
no
oona
my
dear
he
could
never
do
it
and
yon
fine
lad
that
is
so
like
my
ronald
though
you
will
not
see
it
would
never
do
it
you
need
not
look
so
pale
it
is
just
his
way
of
joking
with
you
many
a
man
thinks
it
pleasant
to
tell
a
story
like
that
to
a
lady
just
to
hear
what
she
says
eh
but
it
ill
joking
with
poor
folks
lives
cried
mysie
craning
over
hamish
shoulder
to
hear
every
word
it
none
joking
said
hamish
gruffly
between
the
sweep
of
his
oars
it
none
joking
say
ye
na
it
grim
earnest
or
i
sair
mistaken
said
the
woman
eh
miss
oona
but
i
would
gang
round
the
loch
on
my
bare
feet
sabbath
though
it
be
rather
than
no
give
a
message
like
yon
how
can
we
do
it
cried
oona
how
are
we
to
see
lord
erradeen
i
am
sure
he
will
not
come
to
call
and
even
if
he
did
come
in
the
afternoon
it
would
be
too
late
my
dear
said
forrester
we
will
keep
a
look
out
in
the
morning
hamish
will
just
be
fishing
at
the
point
and
hail
him
as
soon
as
he
sees
him
for
it
was
in
the
morning
he
came
before
oh
mem
cried
mysie
but
would
you
wait
for
that
it
ill
to
lippen
to
a
young
man
fancy
he
might
be
late
of
getting
up
they
mostly
lazy
in
the
morning
or
he
might
be
writing
his
letters
or
he
might
be
seeing
to
his
guns
or
there
just
a
hundred
things
he
might
be
doing
what
would
ye
say
if
miss
oona
was
to
write
one
of
her
bonnie
little
notties
on
that
awfu
bonnie
paper
with
her
name
upo
and
tell
him
ye
wanted
to
see
him
at
ten
or
eleven
or
whatever
time
you
please
or
we
might
go
over
in
the
boat
said
hamish
laconically
forrester
was
used
to
take
much
counsel
she
turned
from
one
to
the
other
with
uncertain
looks
but
oona
she
said
you
are
saying
nothing
and
you
are
generally
the
foremost
if
it
is
not
just
nonsense
and
a
joke
of
john
shaw
i
think
said
oona
that
shaw
will
surely
find
some
other
way
but
it
was
no
joke
mother
who
would
joke
on
such
a
subject
he
said
if
lord
erradeen
called
we
were
to
use
our
influence
that
would
i
said
forrester
use
my
influence
i
would
just
tell
him
you
must
not
do
it
bless
me
a
young
man
new
in
the
country
to
take
a
step
like
that
and
put
every
person
against
him
no
no
it
is
not
possible
but
a
lady
she
added
bridling
a
little
with
her
smile
of
innocent
vanity
a
lady
may
say
anything
she
may
say
things
that
another
person
can
not
i
would
just
tell
him
you
must
not
do
it
and
that
would
be
all
that
would
be
needed
but
bless
me
oona
how
are
we
to
use
our
influence
unless
we
can
see
him
and
i
can
not
see
how
we
are
to
get
at
him
oh
mem
cried
mysie
impeding
hamish
oars
as
she
stretched
over
his
shoulder
just
one
of
miss
oona
little
notties
but
this
was
a
step
that
required
much
reflection
and
at
which
the
anxious
mother
shook
her
head
chapter
xv
it
had
rained
all
night
and
the
morning
was
wet
and
cold
the
water
dull
like
lead
the
sky
a
mass
of
clouds
all
the
bare
branches
of
the
trees
dropping
limp
in
the
humid
air
forrester
on
further
thought
had
not
permitted
oona
to
write
even
the
smallest
of
her
bit
notties
to
lord
erradeen
for
though
she
lived
on
an
isle
in
loch
houran
this
lady
flattered
herself
that
she
knew
the
world
she
indited
a
little
epistle
of
her
own
in
which
she
begged
him
to
come
and
see
her
upon
what
she
might
call
a
matter
of
business
a
thing
that
concerned
his
own
affairs
this
was
carried
by
hamish
but
it
received
no
reply
lord
erradeen
was
out
where
could
he
be
out
on
a
sabbath
day
at
night
in
a
place
where
there
were
no
dinner
parties
nor
any
club
nor
the
temptations
of
a
town
but
just
a
lonely
country
place
nor
was
there
any
answer
in
the
morning
which
was
more
wonderful
still
it
was
forrester
thought
and
she
was
more
than
ever
glad
that
her
daughter
had
not
been
involved
in
the
matter
but
hamish
had
information
which
was
not
communicated
to
the
and
over
which
mysie
and
he
laid
their
heads
together
in
the
kitchen
the
poor
young
gentleman
was
off
his
head
altogether
the
servants
said
the
door
was
just
left
open
and
he
came
in
nobody
knew
when
he
could
not
bear
that
anybody
should
say
a
word
to
him
there
had
been
thoughts
among
them
of
sending
for
his
mother
and
old
symington
showed
to
hamish
a
telegram
prepared
for
milnathort
acquainting
him
with
the
state
of
affairs
which
he
had
not
yet
ventured
to
send
for
he
will
come
to
himself
soon
or
syne
the
old
man
said
it
just
the
weird
of
the
that
is
upon
him
symington
was
indifferent
to
the
fate
of
the
poor
crofters
he
said
the
factor
will
ken
what
to
do
he
was
not
a
loch
houran
man
on
the
monday
however
the
feeling
of
all
the
little
population
on
the
isle
ran
very
high
the
wet
morning
the
leaden
loch
the
clouds
oppressed
the
mental
atmosphere
and
the
thought
of
the
poor
people
turned
out
of
their
houses
in
the
rain
increased
the
misery
of
the
situation
in
a
way
scarcely
to
be
expected
in
the
west
where
it
is
supposed
to
rain
for
ever
at
eleven
oona
appeared
in
her
thickest
ulster
and
her
strongest
boots
i
am
going
up
to
see
old
jenny
she
said
with
a
little
air
of
determination
my
dear
you
will
be
just
wet
through
and
are
you
sure
your
boots
are
thick
enough
you
will
come
back
to
me
with
a
heavy
cold
and
then
what
shall
we
all
do
but
take
some
tea
and
sugar
in
your
basket
oona
said
her
mother
she
went
with
the
girl
to
the
door
in
spite
of
these
which
did
not
mean
anything
and
a
bottle
of
my
ginger
cordial
might
not
be
amiss
they
all
like
it
poor
bodies
and
oona
see
my
dear
here
are
two
pound
notes
it
all
i
have
of
change
and
it
more
than
i
can
afford
but
if
it
comes
to
the
worst
but
surely
surely
john
shaw
that
is
a
very
decent
man
and
comes
of
a
good
family
will
have
found
the
means
to
do
something
the
kind
lady
stood
at
the
door
indifferent
to
the
wet
which
every
breath
of
air
shook
from
the
glistening
branches
it
had
ceased
to
rain
and
in
the
west
there
was
a
pale
clearness
which
made
the
leaden
loch
more
chilly
still
yet
was
a
sign
of
amelioration
forrester
wrung
her
hands
and
cast
one
look
at
the
glistening
woods
of
auchnasheen
and
another
at
the
dark
mass
on
the
edge
of
the
water
of
kinloch
houran
she
did
not
know
whether
to
be
angry
with
lord
erradeen
for
being
so
or
to
compassionate
him
for
the
eclipse
which
he
had
sustained
but
after
all
he
was
a
very
secondary
object
in
her
mind
in
comparison
with
oona
whose
course
she
watched
in
the
boat
drawing
a
long
line
across
the
leaden
surface
of
the
water
she
was
just
like
the
dove
out
of
the
ark
forrester
thought
the
little
hamlet
of
was
at
some
distance
from
the
loch
oona
walked
briskly
along
the
coach
road
for
two
miles
or
thereabouts
then
turned
up
to
the
left
on
a
road
which
narrowed
as
it
ascended
till
it
became
little
more
than
a
cart
track
with
a
footway
at
the
side
in
the
broader
valley
below
a
substantial
farmhouse
with
a
few
outlying
cottages
was
the
only
point
of
habitation
and
on
either
side
of
the
road
a
few
cultivated
fields
chiefly
of
turnips
and
potatoes
were
all
that
broke
the
stretches
of
pasture
extending
to
the
left
as
high
as
grass
would
grow
up
the
dark
slopes
of
the
hills
but
the
smaller
glen
on
the
right
had
a
more
varied
and
lively
appearance
and
was
broken
into
small
fields
bearing
signs
of
cultivation
tolerably
high
up
some
of
them
still
yellow
with
the
stubble
of
the
late
harvest
the
poor
little
crop
of
oats
or
barley
which
never
hoped
to
ripen
before
october
if
then
a
mountain
stream
which
was
scarcely
a
thread
of
water
in
the
summer
now
leaped
fiercely
enough
turbid
and
swollen
from
rock
to
rock
in
its
rapid
descent
the
houses
clustered
on
a
little
tableland
at
some
height
above
the
road
where
a
few
gnarled
hawthorns
rowans
and
birches
were
growing
they
were
poor
enough
to
have
disgusted
any
social
reformer
or
political
economist
grey
growths
of
rough
stones
which
might
have
come
together
by
chance
so
little
shape
was
there
in
the
bulging
walls
only
a
few
of
them
had
even
the
rough
chimney
at
one
end
wattled
with
ropes
of
straw
which
showed
an
advanced
civilisation
the
others
had
nothing
but
the
hole
in
the
roof
which
is
the
first
and
homeliest
expedient
of
primitive
ventilation
it
might
have
been
reasonably
asked
what
charm
these
hovels
could
have
to
any
one
to
make
them
worth
struggling
for
but
reason
is
not
lord
of
all
there
was
no
appearance
of
excitement
about
the
place
when
oona
walking
quickly
and
a
little
out
of
breath
reached
the
foremost
houses
the
men
and
boys
were
out
about
their
work
up
the
hill
or
down
the
water
in
the
occupations
of
the
day
and
indeed
there
were
but
few
men
at
any
time
about
the
place
three
out
of
the
houses
were
tenanted
by
widow
women
one
with
boys
who
cultivated
her
little
holding
one
who
kept
going
with
the
assistance
of
a
hired
lad
while
the
third
lived
upon
her
cow
which
the
neighbours
helped
her
to
take
care
of
the
chief
house
of
the
community
and
the
only
one
which
bore
something
of
a
comfortable
aspect
was
that
of
duncan
fraser
who
had
the
largest
allotment
of
land
and
who
though
he
had
fallen
back
so
far
with
his
rent
as
to
put
himself
in
the
power
of
the
law
was
one
of
the
class
which
as
peasant
proprietors
are
thought
to
be
the
strength
of
france
if
the
land
had
been
his
own
he
would
have
found
existence
very
possible
under
the
hard
and
stern
conditions
which
were
natural
to
him
and
probably
would
have
brought
up
for
the
church
robbie
his
eldest
boy
who
had
got
all
the
parish
school
could
give
him
and
was
still
dreaming
as
he
cut
the
peats
or
hoed
the
potatoes
of
glasgow
college
and
the
world
of
the
other
two
houses
one
was
occupied
by
an
old
pair
whose
children
were
out
in
the
world
and
who
managed
by
the
contributions
of
distant
sons
and
daughters
to
pay
their
rent
the
last
was
in
the
possession
of
a
weirdless
wight
who
loved
whisky
better
than
home
or
holding
and
whose
wife
and
children
toiled
through
as
best
they
could
the
labour
of
their
few
fields
there
were
about
twenty
children
in
the
six
houses
all
ruddy
weatherbeaten
the
girls
tied
up
about
their
shoulders
in
little
tartan
shawls
and
very
bare
about
their
legs
the
boys
in
every
kind
of
quaint
garments
little
bags
of
trousers
cobbled
out
of
bigger
garments
by
workwomen
more
frugal
than
artistic
the
rent
had
failed
for
how
was
money
to
be
had
on
these
levels
but
the
porridge
had
never
altogether
failed
a
few
little
ones
were
playing
about
the
doors
in
a
happy
superiority
to
all
prejudices
on
the
subject
of
mud
and
puddles
one
woman
was
washing
her
clothes
at
her
open
door
old
jenny
whom
oona
had
come
to
see
was
out
upon
her
doorstep
gazing
down
the
glen
to
watch
the
footsteps
of
her
precious
coo
which
a
lass
of
ten
with
streaming
hair
was
leading
out
to
get
a
mouthful
of
wet
grass
mind
was
always
in
a
flutter
lest
something
should
happen
to
the
cow
ye
would
pass
her
by
upon
the
road
miss
oona
the
old
woman
said
and
how
would
ye
think
she
was
looking
to
get
meat
to
her
it
just
a
my
thought
but
i
canna
think
she
will
be
none
the
worse
for
a
bit
mouthfu
on
the
hill
but
jenny
have
you
nothing
to
think
of
but
the
cow
it
will
not
be
true
then
that
the
time
of
grace
is
over
and
that
the
officers
are
coming
to
turn
you
all
out
the
sheriff
officers
cried
jenny
she
took
the
edge
of
her
apron
in
her
hand
and
drew
the
hem
slowly
through
her
fingers
which
was
a
sign
of
perplexity
but
yet
she
was
quite
composed
na
na
miss
oona
they
never
turn
us
out
what
wad
i
be
thinking
about
but
the
coo
she
my
breadwinner

my
family

in
great
trouble
yesterday

was
the
last
day
i
never

my
thoom
about
it
said
jenny
the
last
day
maybe
the
last
or
the
first
i
would
never
be
taking
no
notice
for
the
factor
he
our
great
friend
and
he
would
not
be
letting
them
do
it
no
no
it
would
but
be
his
jokes
the
old
woman
said
was
it
his
jokes
this
was
the
second
time
the
idea
had
been
presented
to
her
but
oona
remembered
the
factor

very
quiet
here
she
said
not
as
if
any
trouble
was
coming
but
has

rent
or
something
muckle

jenny
they
were
to
have
taken
the
coo

have
become
of
me
if
they
had
the
coo
duncan
they
have
his
puir
lad
to
see
it
go
down
the
brae

enough
to
break
your
heart
but
john
shaw
he
a
kind
man
he
would
not
be
letting
them
meddle
with
us
he
just
said
a
lone
woman

lord

do
without
it
better
than
the
old
wife

do
without
it
he
said
he
a
kind
man
and
so
my
bonnie
beast
was
saved
i

wae
for
duncan
but
still
miss
oona
things
is
no
desperate
so
lang
as
you
keep
safe
your
ain
coo
that
is
true
said
oona
with
a
little
laugh
there
must
she
thought
be
some
mistake
or
else
shaw
had
found
lord
erradeen
and
without
the
help
of
any
influence
had
moved
him
to
pity
the
cotters
under
this
consolation
she
got
out
her
tea
and
sugar
and
other
trifles
which
had
been
put
into
the
basket
it
was
a
basket
that
was
well
known
in
the
neighbourhood
and
had
conveyed
many
a
little
dainty
in
time
of
need
jenny
was
grateful
for
the
little
packets
of
tea
and
sugar
which
she
took
more
or
less
as
a
right
but
looked
with
a
curious
eye
at
the
ginger
cordial
for
which
forrester
was
famous
it
was
not
a
wicked
thing
like
whisky
no
no
but
it
warmed
ye
on
a
cold
day
jenny
would
not
have
objected
to
a
drop
while
she
eyed
it
there
became
audible
far
off
voices
down
the
glen
and
sounds
as
of
several
people
approaching
sounds
very
unusual
in
this
remote
corner
of
the
world
jenny
forgot
the
ginger
cordial
and
oona
ran
to
the
door
to
see
what
it
was
and
the
woman
who
had
been
washing
paused
in
her
work
and
old
nancy
robertson
she
whose
rent
was
paid
and
who
had
no
need
to
fear
any
sheriff
officers
came
out
to
her
door
even
the
children
stopped
in
their
game
the
voices
were
still
far
off
down
upon
the
road
upon
which
there
was
a
group
of
men
scarcely
distinguishable
at
this
distance
simon
fraser
wife
she
who
had
been
washing
called
out
that
it
was
duncan
talking
to
the
factor
but
who
were
those
other
men
a
sense
of
approaching
trouble
came
upon
the
women
nelly
fraser
wiped
the
soapsuds
from
her
arms
and
wrung
her
hands
still
fresh
from
her
tub
she
was
always
prepared
for
evil
as
is
natural
to
a
woman
with
a
weirdless
husband
old
jenny
for
her
part
thought
at
once
of
the
coo
she
flew
as
well
as
her
old
legs
would
carry
her
to
the
nearest
knoll
and
shrieked
to
the
little
lass
who
was
slowly
following
that
cherished
animal
to
bring
brockie
back
bring
her
back
ye
silly
thing
will
ye
no
be
seeing
but
i
mauna
say
that
she
added
in
an
undertone
bring
back
the
coo
bring
her
back
jessie
my
lamb
bring
back
the
coo
what
with
old
jenny
shrieking
and
the
voices
in
the
distance
and
something
magnetic
and
charged
with
disorder
in
the
air
people
began
to
appear
from
all
the
houses
one
of
the
widow
sons
a
red
and
hairy
lad
came
running
in
in
his
heavy
boots
from
the
field
where
he
was
working
duncan
fraser
daughter
set
down
a
basket
of
peat
which
she
was
carrying
in
and
called
her
mother
to
the
door
there
my
father
with
the
factor
and
strange
men
said
the
girl
and
oh
what
will
they
be
wanting
here
thus
the
women
and
children
looked
on
with
growing
terror
helpless
before
the
approach
of
fate
as
they
might
have
done
two
centuries
before
when
the
invaders
were
rapine
and
murder
instead
of
calm
authority
and
law
when
oona
made
her
appearance
half
an
hour
before
everything
had
been
unquestioning
tranquillity
and
peace
now
without
a
word
said
all
was
alarm
the
poor
people
did
not
know
what
was
going
to
happen
but
they
felt
that
something
was
going
to
happen
they
had
been
living
on
a
volcano
easily
quietly
without
thinking
much
of
it
but
now
the
fire
was
about
to
blaze
forth
through
the
minds
of
those
that
were
mothers
there
ran
a
calculation
as
swift
as
light
what
will
we
do
with
the
bairns
what
will
we
do
with
granny
and
the
bits
of
plenishing
they
said
to
each
other
the
younger
ones
were
half
pleased
with
the
excitement
not
knowing
what
it
was
meantime
duncan
and
shaw
came
together
up
the
road
the
poor
man
arguing
with
great
animation
and
earnestness
the
factor
listening
with
a
troubled
countenance
and
sometimes
shaking
his
head
behind
them
followed
the
servants
of
the
law
those
uncomfortable
officials
to
whom
the
odium
of
their
occupation
clings
though
it
is
no
fault
of
theirs
no
shaw
we
canna
pay
you
know
that
as
well
as
i
do
but
oh
sir
give
us
a
little
time
would
you
turn
the
weans
out
on
the
hill
and
the
auld
folk
what
would
i
care
if
it
was
just
to
me
but
think
upon
the
wake
creatures
my
auld
mother
that
is
eighty
and
the
bairns
if
my
lord
will
not
let
us
off
there
some
of
the
other
gentry
that
are
kind
and
will
lend
us
a
helping
hand
oh
give
us
time
my
lord
that
is
young
and
so
well
off
he
canna
surely
understand
what
is
it
to
him
and
to
us
it
life
and
death
duncan
my
man
said
the
factor
you
are
just
breaking
my
heart
i
know
all
that
as
well
as
you
but
what
can
i
do
it
is
the
last
day
and
we
have
to
act
or
we
just
make
fools
of
ourselves
my
lord
might
have
stopped
it
but
he
has
not
seen
fit
for
god
sake
say
no
more
for
i
can
not
do
it
ye
just
break
my
heart
by
this
time
the
women
were
within
hearing
and
stood
listening
with
wistful
faces
turning
from
one
to
another
when
he
paused
they
struck
in
together
moving
towards
him
eagerly
oh
shaw
you
always
been
our
friend
cried
duncan
wife
you
canna
mean
that
you
come
to
turn
us
out
to
the
hill
with
all
the
little
ones
and
granny
oh
sir
cried
the
other
have
pity
upon
me
that
has
nae
prop
nor
help
but
just
a
weirdless
man
me
i
have
nae
man
ava
but
just
thae
hands
to
travail
for
my
bairns
said
a
third
and
then
there
came
a
shriller
tone
of
indignation
the
young
lord
he
just
get
a
curse
he
get
no
blessing
the
factor
made
a
deprecating
gesture
with
his
hands
i
can
do
nothing
i
can
do
nothing
he
said
take
your
bairns
down
the
glen
to
my
housekeeper
take
them
down
to
the
town
the
rest
of
ye
they
shall
not
want
whatever
i
can
do
i
do
but
for
god
sake
do
not
stop
us
with
your
wailin
for
it
has
to
be
done
it
is
no
fault
of
mine
this
appeal
touched
one
of
the
sufferers
at
least
with
a
movement
of
fierce
irony
duncan
uttered
a
short
sharp
laugh
which
rung
strangely
into
the
air
so
full
of
passion
haud
your
tongues
women
he
cried
and
no
vex
shaw
you
hurting
his
feelings
with
a
tone
impossible
to
describe
in
which
wrath
and
misery
and
keen
indignation
and
ridicule
contended
for
the
mastery
he
was
the
only
man
in
the
desolate
group
he
drew
a
few
steps
apart
and
folded
his
arms
upon
his
breast
retiring
in
that
pride
of
despair
which
a
cotter
ruined
may
experience
no
less
than
a
king
vanquished
from
further
struggle
or
complaint
the
women
neither
understood
nor
noted
the
finer
meaning
in
his
words
they
had
but
one
thought
the
misery
before
them
they
crowded
round
the
factor
all
speaking
in
one
breath
grasping
his
arm
to
call
his
attention
almost
mobbing
him
with
distracted
appeals
with
the
wild
natural
eloquence
of
their
waving
hands
and
straining
eyes
meanwhile
there
were
other
elements
some
comic
enough
in
the
curious
circle
round
old
nancy
robertson
had
not
left
the
doorstep
where
she
stood
keenly
watching
in
the
composure
and
superiority
of
one
whom
nobody
could
touch
who
had
paid
her
rent
and
was
above
the
world
it
was
scarcely
possible
not
to
be
a
little
complacent
in
the
superiority
of
her
circumstances
or
to
refrain
from
criticising
the
unseemly
excitement
of
the
others
she
had
her
spectacles
on
her
nose
and
her
head
projected
and
she
thought
they
were
all
like
with
their
gesticulations
and
cries
i
wouldna
be
skreighin
like
that
no
me
she
said
round
about
the
fringe
of
children
gaped
and
gazed
some
stolid
with
amaze
some
pale
in
a
vague
sympathetic
misery
none
of
them
quite
without
a
certain
enjoyment
of
this
extraordinary
episode
and
stimulation
of
excitement
and
old
jenny
awakened
to
no
alarm
about
her
cottage
still
stood
upon
her
knoll
with
her
whole
soul
intent
upon
the
fortunes
of
brockie
who
had
met
the
sheriff
officers
in
full
career
the
attempts
of
her
little
guardian
to
turn
the
cow
back
from
her
whiff
of
pasture
had
only
succeeded
in
calling
the
special
attention
of
these
invaders
they
stopped
short
and
one
of
them
taking
a
piece
of
rope
from
his
pocket
secured
it
round
the
neck
of
the
frightened
animal
who
stood
something
like
a
woman
in
a
similar
case
looking
to
left
and
to
right
not
knowing
in
her
confusion
which
way
to
bolt
though
the
intention
was
evident
in
her
terrified
eyes
at
this
jenny
gave
a
shriek
of
mingled
rage
and
terror
which
in
its
superior
force
and
concentrated
passion
rang
through
all
the
other
sounds
silencing
for
the
moment
even
the
wailing
of
the
women
and
flung
herself
into
the
midst
of
the
struggle
she
was
a
dry
little
withered
old
woman
nimble
and
light
and
ran
like
a
hare
or
rabbit
down
the
rough
road
without
a
pause
or
stumble
my
coo
cried
jenny
ye
sallna
tak
her
ye
sall
tak
my
blood
first
my
coo
miss
oona
miss
oona
will
you
just
be
standing
by
like
nothing
at
all
and
letting
them
tak
my
coo
ye
robbers
jenny
shrieked
flinging
one
arm
about
the
neck
of
the
alarmed
brute
while
she
pushed
away
its
captor
with
the
other
her
arm
was
still
vigorous
though
she
was
old
the
man
stumbled
and
lost
his
hold
of
the
rope
the
cow
liberated
tossed
head
and
tail
into
the
air
and
flung
off
to
the
like
a
deer
the
shock
threw
jenny
down
and
stunned
her
this
made
a
little
diversion
in
the
dismal
scene
above
and
now
it
became
evident
that
whatever
was
to
be
done
must
be
done
expression
being
exhausted
on
the
part
of
the
victims
who
stood
about
in
a
blank
of
overwrought
feeling
awaiting
the
next
move
the
factor
made
a
sign
with
his
hand
and
sat
down
upon
a
ledge
of
rock
opposite
the
cottages
his
shaggy
eyebrows
curved
over
his
eyes
his
hat
drawn
down
upon
his
brows
a
sort
of
silent
shock
ran
through
the
beholders
when
the
men
entered
the
first
cottage
and
when
they
came
out
again
carrying
a
piece
of
furniture
there
was
a
cry
half
savage
in
its
wild
impotence
unfortunately
the
first
thing
that
came
to
their
hands
was
a
large
wooden
cradle
in
which
lay
a
baby
tucked
up
under
the
big
patchwork
quilt
which
bulged
out
on
every
side
as
it
was
set
down
upon
its
large
rockers
on
the
uneven
ground
the
little
sleeper
gave
a
startled
wail
and
then
it
was
that
that
cry
sharp
and
keen
dividing
the
silence
like
a
knife
burst
from
the
breasts
of
the
watching
people
it
was
nelly
fraser
baby
who
had
the
weirdless
man
she
stood
with
her
bare
arms
wrapped
in
her
apron
beside
her
abandoned
and
gazed
as
if
incapable
of
movement
with
a
face
like
ashes
at
the
destruction
of
her
home
but
while
the
mother
stood
stupefied
a
little
thing
of
three
or
four
which
had
been
clinging
to
her
skirts
in
keen
baby
wonder
and
attention
when
she
saw
the
cradle
carried
forth
into
the
open
air
immediately
took
the
place
of
guardian
such
an
incident
had
never
happened
in
all
little
jeanie
experience
before
she
trotted
forth
abandoning
all
alarm
to
the
road
in
which
it
was
set
down
and
turning
a
little
smiling
face
of
perfect
content
to
the
world
began
to
rock
it
softly
with
little
coos
of
soothing
and
rills
of
infant
laughter
the
sombre
background
round
with
all
its
human
misery
made
a
dismal
foil
to
this
image
of
innocent
satisfaction
the
factor
jumped
up
and
turned
his
back
upon
the
scene
altogether
biting
his
nails
and
lowering
his
brows
in
a
fury
of
wretchedness
and
at
last
the
poor
women
began
to
stir
and
take
whispered
counsel
with
each
other
there
was
no
longer
room
for
either
hope
or
entreaty
the
only
thing
to
be
thought
of
now
was
what
to
do
the
next
cottage
was
that
of
nancy
robertson
who
still
held
her
position
on
her
doorstep
watching
the
proceedings
with
a
keen
but
somewhat
complacent
curiosity
they
gave
her
an
intense
sense
of
and
superiority
though
she
was
not
without
feeling
when
however
the
men
who
had
warmed
to
their
work
and
knew
no
distinction
between
one
and
another
approached
her
a
sudden
panic
and
fury
seized
the
old
woman
she
defied
them
shrilly
flying
at
the
throat
of
the
foremost
with
her
old
hands
the
wretchedness
of
the
poor
women
whose
children
were
being
thrust
out
shelterless
did
not
reach
the
wild
height
of
passion
of
her
whose
lawful
property
was
threatened
villains
she
shrieked
will

break
into
my
hoose
what
right

my

her
voice
calmed
down
as
the
factor
turned
and
made
an
impatient
sign
to
the
men
ye
see
said
nancy
making
a
little
address
to
her
community

i
no
just
a
heart
of
stane
like
that
young
lord
the
women
had
not
waited
to
witness
nancy
difficulties
most
of
them
had
gone
into
their
houses
to
take
a
shawl
from
a
cupboard
a
book
from
the
one
or
two
appeared
with
the
family
bible
under
their
arm
the
lord
kens
where
we
are
to
go
but
we
must
go
somewhere
they
said
there
was
a
little
group
about
oona
and
her
two
pound
notes
the
moment
of
excitement
was
over
and
they
had
now
nothing
to
do
but
to
meet
their
fate
the
factor
paced
back
and
forward
on
the
path
going
out
of
his
way
to
avoid
here
and
there
a
pile
of
poor
furniture
and
the
work
of
devastation
went
on
rapidly
it
is
so
easy
alas
to
dismantle
a
cottage
with
its
but
and
ben
duncan
fraser
did
not
move
till
two
or
three
had
been
emptied
when
he
went
in
to
bring
out
his
mother
there
was
a
renewed
sensation
among
the
people
who
were
scarcely
capable
of
any
further
excitement
granny
was
granny
to
all
the
glen
she
was
the
only
survivor
of
her
generation
they
had
all
known
her
from
their
earliest
days
they
stood
worn
and
huddled
together
in
a
little
crowd
waiting
before
they
took
any
further
steps
till
granny
should
come
but
it
was
not
granny
who
came
first
some
one
a
stranger
even
to
the
children
whose
attention
was
so
easily
attracted
by
any
novelty
appeared
suddenly
round
a
corner
of
the
hill
he
paused
at
the
unexpected
sight
of
the
little
cluster
of
habitations
for
the
country
was
unknown
to
him
and
for
a
moment
appeared
as
if
he
would
have
turned
back
but
the
human
excitement
about
this
scene
caught
him
in
spite
of
himself
he
gazed
at
it
for
a
moment
trying
to
divine
what
was
happening
then
came
on
slowly
with
hesitating
steps
he
had
been
out
all
the
morning
as
he
had
been
for
some
days
before
his
being
had
sustained
a
great
moral
shock
and
for
the
moment
all
his
holds
on
life
seemed
gone
this
was
the
first
thing
that
had
moved
him
even
to
the
faintest
curiosity
he
came
forward
slowly
observed
by
no
one
the
factor
was
still
standing
with
his
back
to
the
woeful
scene
gloomily
contemplating
the
distant
country
while
oona
moved
about
in
the
midst
of
the
women
joining
in
their
consultations
and
doing
her
best
to
rouse
poor
nelly
who
sat
by
her
baby
cradle
like
a
creature
dazed
and
capable
of
no
further
thought
there
was
therefore
no
one
to
recognise
lord
erradeen
as
he
came
slowly
into
the
midst
of
this
tragedy
not
knowing
what
it
was
the
officials
had
recovered
their
spirits
as
they
got
on
with
their
work
natural
pity
and
sympathetic
feeling
had
yielded
to
the
carelessness
of
habit
and
common
occupation
they
had
begun
to
make
rough
jokes
with
each
other
to
fling
the
cotters
possessions
carelessly
out
of
the
windows
to
give
each
other
catches
with
a
hi
tak
this
flinging
the
things
about
lord
erradeen
had
crossed
the
little
bridge
and
was
in
the
midst
of
the
action
of
the
painful
drama
when
they
brought
out
from
duncan
house
his
old
mother
chair
it
was
cushioned
with
pillows
one
of
which
tumbled
out
into
the
mud
and
was
roughly
caught
up
by
the
rough
fellow
who
carried
it
and
flung
at
his
companion
head
with
a
laugh
and
jest
it
was
he
who
first
caught
sight
of
the
stranger
a
new
figure
among
the
disconsolate
crowd
he
gave
a
whistle
to
his
comrade
to
announce
a
novelty
and
rattled
down
hastily
out
of
his
hands
the
heavy
chair
walter
was
wholly
roused
by
the
strangeness
of
this
pantomime
it
brought
back
something
to
his
mind
though
he
could
scarcely
tell
what
he
stepped
in
front
of
the
man
and
asked
what
does
this
mean
in
a
hasty
and
somewhat
imperious
tone
but
his
eyes
answered
his
question
almost
before
he
had
asked
it
nelly
fraser
with
her
pile
of
furniture
her
helpless
group
of
children
her
stupefied
air
of
misery
was
full
in
the
foreground
and
the
ground
was
strewed
with
other
piles
half
of
the
houses
in
the
hamlet
were
already
gutted
one
poor
woman
was
lifting
her
bedding
out
of
the
wet
putting
it
up
upon
chairs
another
stood
regarding
hers
helplessly
as
if
without
energy
to
attempt
even
so
small
a
salvage
what
is
the
meaning
of
all
this
the
young
man
cried
imperiously
again
his
voice
woke
something
in
the
deep
air
of
despondency
and
misery
which
had
not
been
there
before
it
caught
the
ear
of
oona
who
pushed
the
women
aside
in
sudden
excitement
it
roused
was
it
a
faint
thrill
of
hope
in
the
general
despair
last
of
all
it
reached
the
factor
who
standing
gloomily
apart
had
closed
himself
up
in
angry
wretchedness
against
any
appeal
he
did
not
hear
this
but
somehow
felt
it
in
the
air
and
turned
round
not
knowing
what
the
new
thing
was
when
he
saw
lord
erradeen
shaw
was
seized
as
with
a
sudden
frenzy
he
turned
round
upon
him
sharply
with
an
air
which
was
almost
threatening
what
does
it
mean
he
said
it
means
your
will
and
pleasure
lord
erradeen
not
mine
god
is
my
witness
no
will
of
mine
you
brute
cried
the
factor
suddenly
what
are
you
doing
stand
out
of
the
way
and
let
the
honest
woman
pass
get
out
of
her
way
i
tell
you
or
send
ye
head
foremost
down
the
glen
this
sudden
outcry
which
was
a
relief
to
the
factor
feelings
was
addressed
not
to
walter
but
to
the
man
who
coming
out
again
with
a
new
armful
came
rudely
in
the
way
of
the
old
granny
to
whom
all
the
glen
looked
up
and
who
was
coming
out
with
a
look
of
bewilderment
on
her
aged
face
holding
by
her
son
arm
granny
comprehended
vaguely
if
at
all
what
was
going
on
she
gave
a
momentary
glance
of
suspicion
at
the
fellow
who
pushed
against
her
then
looked
out
with
a
faint
smile
at
the
two
gentlemen
standing
in
front
of
the
door
her
startled
mind
recurred
to
its
old
instincts
with
but
a
faint
perception
of
anything
new
sirs
she
said
in
her
feeble
old
voice
i
am
distressed
i
canna
ask
ye
in
but
i
feckless
mysel
being
a
great
age
and
there
some
flitting
going
on
and
my
she
is
out
of
the
way
do
you
hear
that
my
lord
cried
shaw
the
old
wife
is
making
her
excuses
for
not
asking
you
into
a
house
you
are
turning
her
out
of
at
the
age
of
oh
i
am
not
minding
if
i
give
ye
offence
i
have
had
enough
of
it
find
another
factor
lord
erradeen
i
would
rather
gather
stones
upon
the
fields
than
do
again
what
i
have
done
this
day
walter
looked
about
like
a
man
awakened
from
a
dream
he
said
almost
with
awe
is
this
supposed
to
be
done
by
me
i
know
nothing
of
it
nor
the
reason
what
is
the
reason
i
disown
it
altogether
as
any
act
of
mine
oh
my
lord
cried
shaw
who
was
in
a
state
of
wild
excitement
there
is
the
best
of
reasons
rent
your
lordship
understands
that
a
little
more
money
lest
your
coffers
should
not
be
full
enough
and
as
for
these
poor
bodies
they
have
so
much
to
put
up
with
a
little
more
does
not
matter
they
have
not
a
roof
to
their
heads
but
that
nothing
to
your
lordship
you
can
cover
the
hills
with
sheep
and
they
can
die
if
they
like
cried
the
factor
avenging
himself
for
all
he
had
suffered
he
turned
away
with
a
gesture
of
despair
and
fury
i
have
done
enough
i
wash
my
hands
of
it
he
cried
walter
cast
around
him
a
bewildered
look
to
his
own
consciousness
he
was
a
miserable
and
helpless
man
but
all
the
poor
people
about
gazed
at
him
wistful
deprecating
as
at
a
sort
of
unknown
unfriendly
god
who
had
their
lives
in
his
hands
the
officers
perhaps
thought
it
a
good
moment
to
show
their
zeal
in
the
eyes
of
the
young
lord
they
made
a
plunge
into
the
house
once
more
and
appeared
again
one
carrying
duncan
bed
a
great
slippery
unwieldy
sack
of
chaff
another
charged
with
the
old
tall
clock
which
he
jerked
along
as
if
it
had
been
a
man
hopping
from
one
foot
to
another
we
soon
be
done
my
lord
the
first
said
in
an
encouraging
tone
and
then
a
the
commotion
will
just
die
away
lord
erradeen
had
been
lost
in
a
miserable
dream
he
woke
up
now
at
this
keen
touch
of
reality
and
found
himself
in
a
position
so
abhorrent
and
antagonistic
to
all
his
former
instincts
and
traditions
that
his
very
being
seemed
to
stand
still
in
the
horror
of
the
moment
then
a
sudden
passionate
energy
filled
all
his
veins
the
voice
in
which
he
ordered
the
men
back
rang
through
the
glen
he
had
flung
himself
upon
one
of
them
in
rage
before
he
was
aware
what
he
was
doing
knocking
down
the
astounded
official
who
got
up
rubbing
his
elbow
and
declaring
it
was
no
fault
of
his
while
walter
glared
at
him
not
knowing
what
he
did
but
after
this
encounter
with
flesh
and
blood
lord
erradeen
recovered
his
reason
he
turned
round
quickly
and
with
his
own
hands
carried
back
granny
chair
the
very
weight
of
it
the
touch
of
something
to
do
brought
life
into
his
veins
he
took
the
old
woman
from
her
son
arm
and
led
her
in
reverently
supporting
her
upon
his
own
then
going
out
again
without
a
word
addressed
himself
to
the
manual
work
of
restoration
from
the
moment
of
his
first
movement
the
whole
scene
changed
in
the
twinkling
of
an
eye
the
despairing
apathy
of
the
people
gave
way
to
a
tumult
of
haste
and
activity
duncan
fraser
was
the
first
to
move
my
lord
he
cried
if
you
are
my
lord
his
stern
composure
yielding
to
tremulous
excitement
if
it
your
good
will
and
pleasure
to
let
us
bide
that
all
we
want
take
no
trouble
for
us
take
no
thought
for
that
walter
gave
him
a
look
almost
without
intelligence
he
had
not
a
word
to
say
he
was
not
sufficiently
master
of
himself
to
express
the
sorrow
and
anger
and
humiliation
in
his
awakened
soul
but
he
could
carry
back
the
poor
people
things
which
was
a
language
of
nature
not
to
be
misunderstood
he
went
on
taking
no
heed
of
the
eager
assistance
offered
on
all
sides
i
do
it
my
lord
oh
dinna
you
trouble
ower
much
kindness
ye
fyle
your
fingers
ye
wear
out
your
strength
we
do
it
we
do
it
the
people
cried
the
cottagers
doors
flew
open
as
by
magic
they
worked
all
together
the
women
the
children
and
duncan
fraser
and
lord
erradeen
even
oona
joined
carrying
the
little
children
back
to
their
homes
picking
up
here
a
bird
in
a
cage
there
a
little
stunted
geranium
or
musk
in
a
pot
in
half
an
hour
it
seemed
or
less
the
whole
was
done
and
when
the
clouds
that
had
been
lowering
on
the
hills
and
darkening
the
atmosphere
broke
and
began
to
pour
down
torrents
of
rain
upon
the
glen
the
little
community
was
housed
and
comfortable
once
more
while
this
excitement
lasted
walter
was
once
more
the
healthful
and
vigorous
young
man
who
had
travelled
with
oona
on
the
coach
and
laughed
with
her
on
the
isle
but
when
the
storm
was
over
and
they
walked
together
towards
the
loch
she
became
aware
of
the
difference
in
him
he
was
very
serious
pale
almost
haggard
now
that
the
excitement
was
over
his
smiling
lips
smiled
no
longer
there
was
in
his
eyes
once
so
and
careless
a
sort
of
hunted
anxious
look
no
he
said
in
answer
to
her
questions
i
have
not
been
ill
i
have
had
family
matters
to
occupy
me
and
of
this
i
knew
nothing
letters
i
had
none
i
received
nothing
i
have
been
occupied
too
much
perhaps
with
family
affairs
upon
this
no
comment
could
be
made
but
his
changed
looks
made
so
great
a
claim
upon
her
sympathy
that
oona
looked
at
him
with
eyes
that
were
almost
tender
in
their
pity
he
turned
round
suddenly
and
met
her
glance
you
know
he
said
with
a
slight
tremble
in
his
voice
that
there
are
some
things
they
say
in
every
family
a
little
hard
to
bear
but
i
have
been
too
much
absorbed
i
was
taken
by
surprise
it
shall
happen
no
more
he
held
his
head
high
and
looked
round
him
as
if
to
let
some
one
else
see
the
assurance
he
was
giving
her
i
promise
you
he
added
in
a
tone
that
rang
like
a
defiance
it
shall
happen
no
more
then
he
added
hurriedly
with
a
slight
swerve
aside
and
trembling
in
his
voice
do
you
think
i
might
come
with
you
would
