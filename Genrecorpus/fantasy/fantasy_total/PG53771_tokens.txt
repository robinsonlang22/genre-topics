headpiece
of
the
of
the
news
that
a
white
rose
brings
to
the
countess
of
the
white
setting
on
her
golden
hair
a
hood
spread
with
pearls
and
tying
round
her
waist
the
widow
s
girdle
the
countess
of
the
white
moor
entered
the
chapel
where
she
prayed
each
day
for
the
soul
of
her
husband
killed
by
an
irish
giant
in
single
combat
that
day
she
saw
on
the
cushion
of
her
a
white
rose
at
the
sight
of
it
she
turned
pale
and
her
eyes
grew
dim
she
threw
her
head
back
and
wrung
her
hands
for
she
knew
that
when
a
countess
of
the
white
moor
must
die
she
finds
a
white
rose
on
her
stool
knowing
that
the
time
had
come
for
her
to
leave
this
world
where
she
had
been
within
such
a
short
space
of
time
a
wife
a
mother
and
a
widow
she
went
to
her
room
where
slept
her
son
george
guarded
by
waiting
women
he
was
three
years
old
his
long
eyelashes
threw
a
pretty
shade
on
his
cheeks
and
his
mouth
was
like
a
flower
seeing
how
small
he
was
and
how
young
she
began
to
cry
my
little
boy
she
said
in
a
faint
voice
my
dear
little
boy
you
will
never
have
known
me
and
i
shall
never
again
see
myself
in
your
sweet
eyes
yet
i
nursed
you
myself
so
as
to
be
really
your
mother
and
i
have
refused
to
marry
the
greatest
knights
for
your
sake
she
kissed
a
locket
in
which
was
a
portrait
of
herself
and
a
lock
of
her
hair
and
put
it
round
her
son
s
neck
then
a
mother
s
tear
fell
on
his
cheek
and
he
began
to
move
in
his
cradle
and
rub
his
eyes
with
his
little
fists
but
the
countess
turned
her
head
away
and
fled
from
the
room
her
own
eyes
were
soon
to
close
for
ever
how
could
they
bear
to
look
into
those
two
adorable
eyes
where
the
light
of
understanding
had
just
begun
to
dawn
she
had
a
horse
saddled
and
rode
to
the
castle
of
the
clarides
followed
by
her
squire
freeheart
the
duchess
of
the
clarides
kissed
the
countess
of
the
white
moor
what
good
chance
has
brought
you
here
my
dear
it
is
an
evil
chance
that
has
brought
me
listen
dearest
we
were
married
within
a
few
years
of
each
other
and
we
became
widows
by
a
similar
misfortune
in
these
times
of
chivalry
the
best
die
soonest
and
only
monks
live
long
when
you
became
a
mother
i
had
already
been
one
for
two
years
your
daughter
bee
is
as
beautiful
as
day
and
nothing
can
be
said
against
my
son
george
i
like
you
and
you
like
me
for
i
must
tell
you
i
have
found
a
white
rose
on
the
cushion
of
my
stool
i
am
going
to
die
i
leave
my
son
to
you
the
duchess
was
aware
of
the
news
that
the
white
rose
brings
to
the
ladies
of
the
house
of
white
moor
she
began
to
cry
and
promised
in
her
tears
to
bring
up
bee
and
george
as
sister
and
brother
and
not
to
give
anything
to
one
without
giving
half
to
the
other
then
the
two
ladies
put
their
arms
round
each
other
and
went
to
the
cradle
where
little
bee
slept
under
light
blue
curtains
as
blue
as
the
sky
without
opening
her
eyes
she
moved
her
little
arms
and
as
she
opened
her
fingers
five
small
pink
beams
appeared
to
come
out
of
each
sleeve
he
will
defend
her
said
the
mother
of
george
and
she
will
love
him
the
mother
of
bee
answered
she
will
love
him
a
small
clear
voice
repeated
the
duchess
recognised
it
as
that
of
a
spirit
that
had
long
lived
under
the
hearthstone
on
her
return
to
her
manor
the
lady
of
the
white
moor
divided
her
jewels
among
her
maids
and
having
anointed
herself
with
odorous
essences
and
put
on
her
most
beautiful
clothes
to
honour
that
body
which
will
rise
again
on
the
day
of
judgment
she
laid
herself
down
on
the
bed
and
went
to
sleep
for
ever
the
loves
of
bee
of
the
clarides
and
george
of
the
white
moor
the
ordinary
lot
of
women
is
to
be
more
good
than
beautiful
or
more
beautiful
than
good
but
the
duchess
of
clarides
was
as
good
as
she
was
beautiful
and
she
was
so
beautiful
that
the
princes
who
had
only
seen
her
picture
had
wished
to
marry
her
to
all
their
proposals
she
answered
as
i
have
but
one
soul
i
will
never
have
but
one
husband
yet
she
only
wore
mourning
for
five
years
then
she
put
off
her
long
veil
and
her
black
clothes
for
she
did
not
like
to
depress
those
around
her
or
to
prevent
them
smiling
or
being
merry
in
her
presence
her
duchy
included
large
tracts
of
land
and
lonely
moors
covered
in
all
their
vast
extent
with
heather
also
lakes
where
fishermen
caught
fish
some
of
which
were
magical
and
mountains
terrible
and
lonely
beneath
which
the
dwarfs
lived
in
their
underground
kingdom
in
the
government
of
the
clarides
she
followed
the
advice
of
an
old
monk
who
had
escaped
from
constantinople
his
belief
in
the
wisdom
of
men
was
small
for
he
had
seen
how
brutal
and
perfidious
they
are
he
lived
shut
up
in
a
tower
with
his
birds
and
his
books
and
there
he
performed
his
duties
as
counsellor
acting
according
to
a
very
few
principles
his
rules
were
not
to
revive
old
laws
to
give
way
to
the
wishes
of
the
people
for
fear
of
rebellion
but
to
give
way
as
slowly
as
possible
because
when
one
reform
is
carried
out
the
public
immediately
demand
another
princes
are
deposed
for
giving
way
too
quickly
just
as
they
are
for
resisting
too
long
the
duchess
understanding
nothing
at
all
about
politics
let
him
do
as
he
pleased
she
was
charitable
and
as
she
could
not
like
all
men
she
was
sorry
for
those
unfortunate
enough
to
be
wicked
she
helped
the
unhappy
in
every
possible
way
visited
the
sick
consoled
widows
and
provided
for
orphans
she
brought
up
her
daughter
bee
with
the
most
charming
wisdom
she
taught
this
child
only
to
take
pleasure
in
doing
good
consequently
she
could
indulge
her
to
any
extent
this
amiable
lady
kept
her
promise
made
to
the
poor
countess
of
the
white
moor
she
acted
as
a
mother
to
george
and
made
no
distinction
between
bee
and
him
they
grew
up
together
and
george
found
bee
to
his
taste
though
rather
small
one
day
when
they
were
still
in
their
earliest
childhood
he
came
to
her
and
said
will
you
play
with
me
i
would
like
to
said
bee
we
will
find
some
sand
and
make
sand
pies
said
george
so
they
made
pies
but
as
bee
did
not
make
hers
very
well
george
hit
her
on
the
fingers
with
his
spade
bee
uttered
the
most
piercing
shrieks
and
the
squire
freeheart
who
was
walking
in
the
gardens
said
to
his
young
lord
it
is
not
a
deed
worthy
of
a
count
of
the
white
moor
to
beat
young
ladies
your
highness
george
s
first
impulse
was
to
thrust
his
spade
right
through
the
body
of
the
squire
but
as
the
difficulties
of
this
enterprise
seemed
insuperable
he
fell
back
upon
an
easier
course
of
action
which
was
to
turn
his
face
against
a
big
tree
and
weep
copiously
in
the
meanwhile
bee
took
good
care
to
keep
her
tears
flowing
by
digging
her
fists
into
her
eyes
and
in
her
despair
she
flattened
her
nose
against
the
trunk
of
a
neighbouring
tree
when
night
began
to
cover
the
earth
george
and
bee
were
still
weeping
each
in
front
of
their
tree
the
duchess
of
the
clarides
had
to
take
her
daughter
with
one
hand
and
george
with
the
other
to
bring
them
back
to
the
castle
their
eyes
were
red
their
noses
were
red
their
cheeks
were
shiny
their
sobs
and
snuffles
were
they
ate
their
supper
with
a
good
appetite
then
each
was
put
to
bed
but
as
soon
as
the
candle
was
blown
out
they
slipped
out
of
bed
like
little
ghosts
and
kissed
each
other
shouting
with
laughter
so
the
loves
of
bee
of
the
clarides
and
george
of
the
white
moor
began
deals
with
education
in
general
and
that
of
george
in
george
grew
up
in
this
castle
next
to
bee
whom
he
called
sister
in
the
way
of
friendship
though
he
knew
she
was
not
so
he
had
masters
to
teach
him
fencing
riding
swimming
gymnastics
dancing
hunting
falconry
tennis
and
generally
all
the
arts
he
even
had
a
writing
master
an
old
clerk
humble
in
his
ways
but
inwardly
proud
who
taught
him
various
styles
of
handwriting
the
more
beautiful
the
style
was
the
more
difficult
it
was
to
read
george
found
little
pleasure
and
consequently
little
benefit
either
in
the
lessons
of
this
old
clerk
or
in
those
of
an
old
monk
who
gave
grammatical
instruction
using
the
most
barbarous
terminology
george
could
not
make
out
why
he
should
take
the
trouble
to
learn
a
tongue
he
could
talk
by
nature
which
is
called
the
mother
tongue
the
only
person
he
liked
being
with
was
the
squire
freeheart
who
having
sought
adventures
all
over
the
world
knew
the
customs
of
men
and
of
beasts
described
all
sorts
of
countries
and
composed
songs
he
did
not
know
how
to
write
down
freeheart
was
the
only
master
who
taught
george
anything
because
he
was
the
only
one
who
liked
him
and
affectionate
lessons
are
the
only
good
lessons
but
the
two
pedants
the
writing
master
and
the
grammatical
master
who
hated
each
other
with
all
their
heart
united
in
a
common
hatred
of
the
old
squire
whom
they
accused
of
inebriety
it
was
true
that
freeheart
was
rather
too
fond
of
going
to
the
tavern
called
the
there
he
forgot
his
cares
and
composed
his
songs
he
was
certainly
in
the
wrong
homer
composed
songs
even
better
than
freeheart
and
homer
only
drank
spring
water
as
to
troubles
everybody
has
them
and
it
is
not
drinking
wine
but
giving
happiness
to
others
that
effaces
them
but
freeheart
was
an
old
man
grown
grey
in
the
wars
loyal
and
meritorious
and
the
two
masters
ought
to
have
hidden
his
weakness
instead
of
reporting
them
with
exaggeration
to
the
duchess
freeheart
is
a
drunkard
said
the
writing
master
and
when
he
comes
back
from
the
tavern
called
the
he
describes
in
the
road
large
s
s
as
he
walks
i
may
say
that
this
is
the
only
letter
he
has
ever
shaped
for
this
drunkard
is
an
ignoramus
your
grace
the
grammatical
master
added
as
he
staggers
along
he
sings
songs
that
offend
against
every
rule
and
follow
no
received
form
he
is
totally
ignorant
of
synecdoche
your
grace
the
duchess
had
a
natural
dislike
of
meanness
and
she
did
what
all
of
us
would
have
done
in
the
same
situation
she
disregarded
them
at
first
but
as
they
kept
on
repeating
their
reports
she
ended
by
believing
them
and
determined
to
remove
freeheart
however
to
make
his
exile
honourable
she
sent
him
to
rome
to
get
the
blessing
of
the
pope
what
made
this
journey
so
long
to
the
squire
freeheart
was
the
large
number
of
taverns
haunted
by
musicians
which
lay
between
the
duchy
of
the
clarides
and
the
papal
city
the
story
will
show
how
soon
the
duchess
was
to
regret
she
had
deprived
the
two
children
of
their
most
reliable
protector
how
the
duchess
took
bee
and
george
to
the
hermitage
and
of
their
meeting
an
hideous
old
woman
one
morning
that
of
the
first
sunday
after
easter
the
duchess
issued
from
the
castle
on
her
big
chestnut
horse
having
on
her
left
george
of
the
white
moor
riding
a
pony
who
had
a
white
star
in
the
middle
of
his
forehead
and
on
her
right
bee
who
had
a
pink
bridle
to
govern
a
pony
with
a
coat
they
were
going
to
hear
mass
at
the
hermitage
soldiers
carrying
lances
escorted
them
and
there
was
a
press
of
people
on
the
way
to
admire
them
and
really
each
of
the
three
was
very
beautiful
the
duchess
looked
stately
and
sweet
under
her
veil
spangled
with
silver
flowers
and
her
loose
cloak
the
mild
splendour
of
the
pearls
which
embroidered
her
headdress
was
becoming
to
the
face
and
to
the
soul
of
this
beautiful
person
next
to
her
george
with
his
waving
hair
and
bright
eye
looked
quite
handsome
and
the
soft
clear
colour
of
bee
s
face
who
was
riding
on
her
other
side
was
a
delicious
pleasure
to
the
eye
but
nothing
was
more
wonderful
than
the
flow
of
her
fair
hair
bound
in
a
ribbon
embroidered
with
three
golden
lilies
it
fell
down
her
shoulders
like
the
splendid
mantle
of
youth
and
beauty
the
good
folk
looked
at
her
and
each
said
to
the
other
what
a
pretty
young
lady
the
master
tailor
old
john
lifted
his
grandson
peter
in
his
arms
to
show
him
bee
and
peter
asked
whether
she
was
alive
or
whether
she
was
not
really
a
piece
of
waxwork
he
could
not
understand
that
a
creature
so
white
and
delicate
could
belong
to
the
same
species
as
he
little
peter
did
with
his
chubby
sunburnt
cheeks
and
drab
rustic
smock
laced
at
the
back
while
the
duchess
received
these
marks
of
respect
with
kindness
the
two
children
showed
the
contentment
of
pride
george
in
his
flush
bee
in
her
smile
this
is
why
the
duchess
said
to
them
these
good
people
greet
us
very
cheerfully
george
what
do
you
think
of
it
and
what
do
you
bee
that
they
do
well
said
bee
and
that
it
is
their
duty
said
george
and
for
what
reason
is
it
their
duty
the
duchess
asked
seeing
they
gave
no
answer
she
continued
i
am
going
to
tell
you
from
father
to
son
for
more
than
three
hundred
years
the
dukes
of
the
clarides
lance
in
rest
protected
these
poor
people
who
owe
it
to
them
that
they
can
reap
the
harvest
they
have
sown
for
more
than
three
hundred
years
every
duchess
of
the
clarides
has
spun
wool
for
the
poor
visited
the
sick
and
held
their
babies
over
the
baptismal
font
that
is
why
children
you
are
greeted
george
thought
the
ploughman
will
have
to
be
protected
and
bee
i
will
have
to
spin
wool
for
the
poor
so
conversing
and
reflecting
they
made
their
way
through
meadows
enamelled
with
flowers
a
range
of
blue
hills
ran
its
indented
line
along
the
horizon
george
stretched
out
his
hand
towards
the
east
is
not
that
a
large
shield
of
steel
that
i
see
over
there
it
is
rather
a
silver
buckle
as
large
as
the
moon
said
bee
it
is
neither
a
shield
of
steel
nor
a
silver
buckle
children
the
duchess
answered
but
a
lake
shining
in
the
sun
the
face
of
the
water
that
from
a
distance
looks
as
smooth
as
a
mirror
is
broken
into
innumerable
waves
the
banks
of
this
lake
that
seem
to
you
as
clean
as
if
they
were
cut
out
of
metal
are
really
covered
with
reeds
waving
their
light
plumes
and
with
irises
whose
flower
is
like
a
human
eye
among
drawn
swords
each
morning
white
mists
cover
the
lake
which
shines
like
armour
under
the
midday
sun
but
you
must
not
go
near
it
for
the
sylphs
live
there
who
draw
travellers
down
into
their
crystal
manor
and
now
they
heard
the
tinkle
of
the
hermitage
bell
let
us
get
off
said
the
duchess
and
go
on
foot
to
the
chapel
it
was
neither
on
their
elephants
nor
their
camels
that
the
wise
men
of
the
east
approached
the
manger
they
heard
the
hermit
s
mass
an
old
woman
hideous
and
in
rags
knelt
next
to
the
duchess
who
offered
her
holy
water
as
they
went
out
of
church
and
said
take
some
my
good
woman
george
was
astonished
do
you
not
know
said
the
duchess
that
you
must
honour
the
poor
as
the
favourites
of
jesus
christ
a
beggar
woman
just
like
this
one
held
you
over
the
baptismal
font
with
the
good
duke
of
the
black
rocks
and
similarly
your
little
sister
bee
had
a
beggar
as
a
godfather
the
old
woman
who
had
guessed
the
feelings
of
the
little
boy
leaned
towards
him
leering
and
said
i
wish
you
the
conquest
of
as
many
kingdoms
as
i
have
lost
my
prince
i
have
been
queen
of
the
island
of
pearls
and
of
the
mountains
of
gold
every
day
i
had
fourteen
different
kinds
of
fish
served
at
my
table
and
a
little
blackamoor
to
carry
my
train
and
by
what
misfortune
did
you
lose
your
islands
and
your
mountains
my
good
woman
asked
the
duchess
i
offended
the
dwarfs
who
have
carried
me
off
from
my
states
have
the
dwarfs
so
much
power
asked
george
living
under
the
earth
the
old
woman
said
they
know
the
virtue
of
stones
fashion
metal
and
discover
springs
the
duchess
and
what
did
you
do
to
vex
them
good
mother
the
old
woman
on
a
night
of
december
one
of
them
came
to
me
to
ask
my
permission
to
prepare
a
great
new
year
s
supper
in
the
kitchens
of
the
castle
which
were
larger
than
a
capitular
hall
and
furnished
with
stew
and
preserving
and
frying
pans
pipkins
caldrons
boilers
ovens
gridirons
porringers
meat
screens
jugs
goblets
of
gold
and
silver
and
of
grained
woods
not
to
speak
of
the
turnspit
skilfully
wrought
of
iron
and
the
huge
black
kettle
hanging
to
the
pothook
he
promised
that
nothing
should
be
lost
or
damaged
i
refused
his
request
and
he
withdrew
muttering
dark
threats
three
nights
after
which
was
that
of
christmas
the
same
dwarf
returned
to
the
room
in
which
i
was
sleeping
he
was
accompanied
by
a
multitude
of
others
who
pulled
me
from
my
bed
and
carried
me
off
in
my
nightshirt
to
an
unknown
land
this
they
said
to
me
on
leaving
this
is
the
punishment
of
rich
people
who
will
not
grant
a
portion
of
their
treasures
to
the
industrious
and
gentle
nation
of
dwarfs
who
fashion
gold
and
cause
the
springs
to
flow
so
spoke
the
toothless
old
woman
and
the
duchess
having
comforted
her
with
words
and
money
again
took
the
road
to
the
castle
with
her
two
children
concerned
with
what
you
see
from
the
keep
of
the
one
day
not
long
after
this
bee
and
george
without
being
seen
climbed
up
the
stairs
of
the
keep
which
rises
in
the
middle
of
the
castle
on
reaching
the
platform
they
shouted
loudly
and
clapped
their
hands
the
view
stretched
over
rolling
downs
cultivated
and
cut
up
into
small
green
and
brown
squares
on
the
horizon
they
could
see
hills
and
woods
blue
in
the
distance
little
sister
cried
george
little
sister
look
at
the
whole
earth
it
is
very
big
said
bee
my
professor
said
george
had
taught
me
that
it
was
big
but
as
gertrude
our
governess
says
seeing
is
believing
they
walked
round
the
platform
here
is
a
marvellous
thing
little
brother
said
bee
the
castle
is
in
the
middle
of
the
whole
earth
and
we
who
are
on
the
keep
which
is
in
the
middle
of
the
castle
are
now
in
the
middle
of
the
whole
world
ha
ha
ha
and
really
the
skyline
was
around
the
children
like
a
circle
of
which
the
keep
was
the
centre
we
are
in
the
middle
of
the
world
ha
ha
ha
george
repeated
then
both
began
to
think
what
a
pity
it
is
that
the
world
is
so
big
said
bee
you
can
lose
yourself
in
it
and
be
separated
from
your
friends
george
shrugged
his
shoulders
how
nice
it
is
that
the
world
is
so
big
you
can
look
for
adventures
in
it
bee
when
i
am
grown
up
i
mean
to
conquer
those
mountains
which
are
right
at
the
end
of
the
earth
it
is
there
that
the
moon
rises
i
will
catch
it
as
i
go
along
and
give
it
to
you
my
bee
that
s
it
said
bee
you
will
give
it
to
me
and
i
will
set
it
in
my
hair
then
they
began
to
look
for
the
places
they
knew
as
if
on
a
map
i
know
perfectly
where
we
are
said
bee
who
knew
nothing
of
the
sort
but
i
can
not
guess
what
all
those
little
square
stones
sown
on
the
side
of
the
hill
are
houses
answered
george
those
are
houses
don
t
you
recognise
little
sister
the
capital
of
the
duchy
of
the
clarides
it
is
quite
a
big
town
it
has
three
streets
of
which
one
is
paved
we
passed
through
it
last
week
to
go
to
the
hermitage
don
t
you
remember
it
and
that
winding
stream
that
s
the
river
look
at
the
old
stone
bridge
over
there
the
bridge
under
which
we
fished
for
lobsters
the
very
one
which
has
in
the
recess
the
statue
of
the
headless
woman
but
you
can
not
see
her
from
here
because
she
is
too
small
i
remember
why
has
she
no
head
probably
because
she
has
lost
it
without
saying
whether
the
explanation
satisfied
her
bee
kept
her
eyes
fixed
on
the
distance
little
brother
little
brother
do
you
see
what
is
shining
near
the
blue
mountains
it
is
the
lake
it
s
the
lake
they
now
remembered
what
the
duchess
had
told
them
of
the
lovely
and
dangerous
waters
where
the
sylphs
had
their
manor
let
us
go
there
said
bee
this
decision
overwhelmed
george
who
gaped
and
said
the
duchess
has
forbidden
us
to
go
out
alone
and
how
can
we
get
to
this
lake
which
is
at
the
end
of
the
world
how
to
get
there
i
really
don
t
know
but
you
ought
to
who
are
a
man
and
have
a
grammar
master
george
was
stung
and
answered
that
it
is
possible
to
be
a
man
and
even
a
fine
man
without
knowing
all
the
roads
in
the
world
bee
gave
him
a
mincing
disdainful
look
made
him
blush
to
the
tips
of
his
ears
and
said
to
him
primly
i
am
not
the
one
who
promised
to
conquer
the
blue
mountains
and
to
unhook
the
moon
i
do
not
know
the
road
to
the
lake
but
i
will
find
it
you
see
ha
ha
ha
said
george
trying
to
laugh
you
laugh
like
a
booby
sir
bee
boobies
neither
laugh
nor
cry
if
they
did
they
would
laugh
like
you
i
will
go
to
the
lake
alone
and
while
i
discover
the
lovely
waters
where
the
sylphs
live
you
can
stay
at
the
castle
all
by
yourself
like
a
little
girl
i
will
leave
you
my
tapestry
frame
and
my
doll
please
take
great
care
of
them
george
please
take
great
care
of
them
george
had
pride
he
felt
the
shame
which
bee
put
upon
him
with
his
head
down
darkly
he
cried
in
a
muffled
voice
all
right
we
will
go
to
the
lake
how
bee
and
george
went
off
to
the
next
day
after
lunch
when
the
duchess
had
retired
to
her
room
george
took
bee
by
the
hand
come
along
he
said
to
her
where
hush
they
went
down
the
stairs
and
crossed
the
courts
when
they
had
passed
the
gate
bee
asked
a
second
time
where
they
were
going
to
the
lake
george
answered
decisively
the
mouth
of
the
stupefied
miss
bee
gaped
was
it
sensible
to
go
that
distance
and
in
satin
slippers
for
her
slippers
were
of
satin
we
must
go
there
and
we
need
not
be
sensible
such
was
the
lofty
answer
given
by
george
to
bee
she
had
put
him
to
shame
and
now
she
pretended
to
be
astonished
it
was
now
his
turn
to
refer
her
disdainfully
to
her
doll
girls
goad
a
man
into
adventures
and
then
draw
back
her
behaviour
was
disgraceful
she
might
stay
behind
but
he
would
go
himself
she
took
him
by
the
arm
he
pushed
her
away
she
flung
herself
round
the
neck
of
her
brother
little
brother
she
said
sobbing
i
will
follow
you
her
repentance
was
complete
and
it
moved
him
come
along
he
said
but
do
not
let
us
go
by
the
town
we
might
be
seen
we
had
better
follow
the
ramparts
and
reach
the
high
road
by
a
short
cut
they
went
holding
each
other
by
the
hand
george
explained
the
scheme
he
had
drawn
up
we
will
follow
the
road
we
took
to
go
to
the
hermitage
we
are
certain
to
see
it
as
we
saw
it
last
time
and
then
we
will
go
straight
to
it
across
the
field
in
a
in
a
is
a
pretty
country
way
of
saying
a
straight
line
but
the
name
of
the
little
maid
occurring
quaintly
in
the
idiom
made
them
laugh
bee
picked
flowers
growing
by
the
ditch
flowers
of
the
mallow
and
the
mullein
asters
and
oxeyes
making
a
posy
of
them
the
flowers
faded
visibly
in
her
little
hands
and
they
looked
pitiful
when
bee
crossed
the
stone
bridge
as
she
did
not
know
what
to
do
with
her
posy
the
idea
occurred
to
her
of
throwing
them
in
the
water
to
refresh
them
but
she
preferred
to
give
them
to
the
headless
woman
she
asked
george
to
lift
her
in
his
arms
to
make
her
tall
enough
and
she
placed
her
handful
of
country
flowers
in
the
folded
hands
of
the
old
stone
figure
at
a
distance
she
turned
her
head
and
saw
a
dove
on
the
shoulder
of
the
statue
they
walked
some
time
and
bee
said
i
am
thirsty
so
am
i
said
george
but
the
river
is
far
behind
us
and
i
can
see
neither
stream
nor
spring
the
sun
is
so
hot
it
must
have
drunk
them
all
up
what
shall
we
do
thus
they
talked
and
complained
when
they
saw
a
countrywoman
with
a
basket
full
of
fruit
cherries
cried
george
what
a
pity
it
is
that
i
have
no
money
to
buy
any
i
have
some
money
said
bee
she
drew
out
of
her
pocket
a
purse
with
five
pieces
of
gold
in
it
and
addressed
the
good
woman
she
said
will
you
give
me
as
many
cherries
as
my
dress
can
carry
as
she
spoke
she
held
out
the
skirt
of
her
frock
with
both
hands
the
countrywoman
threw
two
or
three
handfuls
of
cherries
into
it
bee
took
the
fold
of
her
skirt
in
one
hand
and
with
the
other
held
out
a
piece
of
gold
to
the
woman
and
said
is
that
enough
that
the
countrywoman
seized
the
piece
of
gold
which
would
have
been
a
high
price
for
all
the
cherries
in
the
basket
with
the
tree
on
which
they
had
grown
and
the
orchard
in
which
the
tree
was
planted
and
she
cunningly
answered
that
will
do
to
oblige
you
my
little
princess
then
replied
bee
put
some
more
cherries
in
my
brother
s
hat
and
i
will
give
you
another
gold
piece
this
was
done
and
the
countrywoman
pursued
her
way
thinking
of
the
old
stocking
under
the
mattress
in
which
she
was
to
hide
her
two
pieces
of
gold
and
the
two
children
went
on
their
road
eating
the
cherries
and
throwing
the
stones
to
the
right
and
the
left
george
looked
for
cherries
held
together
in
pairs
by
the
stalk
to
make
earrings
of
them
for
his
sister
and
he
laughed
to
see
the
beautiful
twin
fruit
swinging
on
the
cheek
of
bee
a
pebble
checked
their
joyful
progress
it
had
stuck
in
the
slipper
of
bee
who
began
to
limp
at
each
hop
she
took
her
gold
curls
waved
on
her
cheeks
and
limping
thus
she
went
and
sat
down
there
her
brother
kneeling
at
her
feet
took
off
her
satin
slipper
he
shook
it
and
a
little
white
pebble
rolled
out
then
looking
at
her
feet
she
said
little
brother
when
we
go
again
to
the
lake
we
will
put
on
boots
the
sun
had
by
now
declined
in
the
radiant
sky
a
breath
of
wind
fanned
the
necks
and
the
cheeks
of
the
young
travellers
who
boldly
and
with
fresh
alacrity
pursued
their
travels
to
walk
more
easily
they
held
each
other
by
the
hand
and
sang
and
they
laughed
to
see
their
two
black
shadows
likewise
united
moving
in
front
of
them
they
sang
marian
the
maid
demure
and
staid
went
riding
to
the
mill
she
placed
her
load
of
corn
and
rode
upon
her
donkey
bill
but
bee
stops
she
cries
i
have
lost
my
slipper
my
satin
slipper
and
it
was
as
she
said
the
silk
bows
of
the
little
slipper
had
got
loose
as
she
walked
and
it
lay
all
dusty
in
the
road
then
she
looked
behind
her
and
seeing
the
towers
of
the
castle
swimming
in
the
distant
mist
she
felt
a
pang
and
tears
came
into
her
eyes
the
wolves
will
eat
us
she
said
and
our
mother
will
never
see
us
again
and
she
will
die
of
grief
but
george
brought
her
slipper
to
her
and
said
when
the
castle
bell
rings
for
supper
we
will
be
back
at
the
clarides
forward
the
miller
tight
with
flour
white
stood
close
under
the
mill
and
fair
and
free
cried
to
that
tree
tie
up
your
donkey
bill
the
lake
bee
look
the
lake
the
lake
the
lake
yes
george
the
lake
george
cried
hurrah
and
threw
his
hat
in
the
air
bee
was
too
well
behaved
to
throw
up
her
coif
in
the
same
fashion
but
taking
off
her
slipper
which
barely
held
she
threw
it
over
her
head
to
show
her
joy
there
it
was
the
lake
at
the
bottom
of
the
valley
the
slopes
of
which
ran
round
the
silvery
waters
holding
them
as
in
a
cup
of
foliage
and
flowers
there
it
was
calm
and
clear
and
a
shiver
still
ran
over
the
ruffled
grasses
of
its
banks
but
the
two
children
could
not
discover
any
road
in
the
thickets
to
take
them
to
this
lovely
mere
as
they
searched
their
legs
were
bitten
by
geese
who
were
followed
by
a
little
girl
dressed
in
a
sheepskin
with
a
switch
in
her
hand
george
asked
her
what
she
was
called
gill
well
gill
how
do
you
go
to
the
lake
i
don
t
go
why
because
but
if
you
did
go
if
i
did
go
there
would
be
a
road
and
i
would
take
the
road
there
was
no
answer
to
be
given
to
the
all
right
said
george
we
will
certainly
find
a
path
in
the
wood
further
on
we
will
pick
nuts
there
said
bee
and
eat
them
for
i
am
hungry
we
must
when
we
come
again
to
the
lake
bring
a
bag
full
of
things
good
to
eat
george
we
will
do
as
you
say
little
sister
i
now
approve
the
plan
of
the
squire
freeheart
who
when
he
set
out
for
rome
took
with
him
a
ham
for
hunger
and
a
demijohn
for
thirst
but
we
must
hurry
for
it
seems
to
me
it
is
getting
late
though
i
do
not
know
the
time
shepherdesses
know
it
by
looking
at
the
sun
said
bee
but
i
am
not
a
shepherdess
yet
it
seems
to
me
that
this
sun
which
was
above
our
heads
when
we
started
is
now
over
there
far
behind
the
town
and
the
land
of
the
clarides
i
wish
i
knew
whether
this
is
the
case
every
day
and
what
it
means
while
they
thus
observed
the
sun
a
cloud
of
dust
rose
on
the
road
and
they
saw
horsemen
who
moved
towards
them
at
full
gallop
and
whose
armour
glittered
the
children
were
very
frightened
and
went
and
hid
in
the
underwoods
they
are
robbers
or
rather
ogres
they
thought
but
really
they
were
sent
by
the
duchess
of
clarides
to
search
for
the
two
little
adventurers
the
two
little
adventurers
found
a
narrow
path
in
the
underwood
which
was
not
a
lover
s
path
for
two
could
not
walk
side
by
side
holding
each
other
by
the
hand
as
lovers
do
further
the
footprints
were
not
human
only
a
track
made
by
a
multitude
of
little
hoofed
feet
was
visible
these
are
the
footprints
of
elves
said
bee
or
roedeer
said
george
the
problem
is
as
yet
unsolved
but
what
is
certain
is
that
the
path
led
by
an
easy
descent
to
the
edge
of
the
lake
which
now
unfolded
itself
to
the
children
in
all
its
languid
and
silent
beauty
willows
bent
their
tender
foliage
over
it
reeds
like
pliant
swords
swayed
their
delicate
plumes
on
the
water
they
stood
ruffling
in
islands
and
around
them
the
spread
their
broad
leaves
and
their
pure
white
flowers
over
the
flowering
islands
shrill
flew
whirling
and
darting
with
emerald
or
sapphire
breastplates
and
wings
of
flame
and
the
two
children
enjoyed
the
exquisite
pleasure
of
dipping
their
burning
feet
into
the
wet
gravel
where
the
thyme
grew
thick
and
the
cattail
darted
its
long
spikes
from
its
lowly
stem
the
iris
yielded
them
its
scent
all
around
the
ribwort
unrolled
its
lace
on
the
edge
of
the
sleeping
waters
which
were
studded
with
the
loosestrife
s
purple
flowers
the
penalty
george
of
the
white
moor
paid
for
having
gone
near
to
the
lake
where
live
the
bee
went
forward
on
the
gravel
between
two
clumps
of
willows
and
in
front
of
her
the
little
genius
of
the
place
jumped
into
the
water
and
made
rings
on
its
surface
which
grew
larger
and
larger
till
they
vanished
this
genius
was
a
little
green
frog
with
a
white
stomach
all
was
silent
a
fresh
breath
of
wind
swept
over
that
clear
lake
of
which
each
wave
rose
in
a
gracious
and
smiling
fold
this
is
a
pretty
lake
said
bee
but
my
feet
are
bleeding
in
my
little
torn
slippers
and
i
am
very
hungry
i
wish
i
was
in
the
castle
little
sister
said
george
sit
on
the
grass
i
am
going
to
wrap
your
feet
in
leaves
to
cool
them
then
i
will
go
and
look
for
supper
for
you
i
saw
up
there
close
to
the
road
briars
black
with
berries
i
will
bring
you
the
largest
and
sweetest
in
my
hat
give
me
your
handkerchief
i
will
fill
it
with
strawberries
for
there
are
plants
close
by
the
edge
of
the
path
under
the
shade
of
the
trees
and
i
will
fill
my
pockets
with
nuts
he
made
a
bed
of
moss
for
bee
near
the
side
of
the
lake
under
a
willow
and
went
off
bee
lay
with
clasped
hands
on
her
bed
of
moss
and
saw
the
stars
kindle
their
tremulous
lights
in
the
pale
sky
then
her
eyes
half
shut
yet
she
seemed
to
see
in
the
air
a
little
dwarf
riding
on
a
crow
this
was
not
an
illusion
the
dwarf
drew
the
bridle
in
the
mouth
of
the
black
bird
stopped
above
the
little
girl
and
fixed
his
round
eyes
on
her
then
he
struck
his
spurs
and
went
off
at
full
flight
bee
saw
these
things
confusedly
and
went
to
sleep
she
was
sleeping
when
george
came
back
with
his
harvest
which
he
put
next
to
her
he
then
went
down
to
the
edge
of
the
lake
to
wait
till
she
woke
the
lake
was
sleeping
under
its
delicate
crown
of
leafage
a
light
mist
softly
crept
over
it
all
at
once
the
moon
showed
itself
between
the
branches
and
immediately
the
waters
were
strewn
with
points
of
light
george
plainly
saw
that
the
lights
which
glanced
on
the
waters
were
not
all
broken
reflections
of
the
moon
for
he
noticed
blue
flames
which
came
whirling
nearer
and
rose
and
fell
and
swayed
as
if
they
were
dancing
rounds
he
soon
discerned
that
these
flames
flickered
on
white
foreheads
on
the
foreheads
of
women
in
a
short
time
lovely
heads
crowned
with
weed
and
shell
shoulders
down
which
fell
blue
hair
bosoms
glittering
with
pearls
and
from
which
veils
were
sliding
rose
above
the
waves
the
boy
recognised
the
sylphs
and
tried
to
fly
but
already
pale
cold
arms
had
seized
him
and
he
was
being
carried
in
spite
of
his
struggles
and
screams
through
the
waters
in
halls
of
crystal
and
porphyry
how
bee
was
taken
to
the
land
of
the
the
moon
had
risen
above
the
lake
and
only
the
broken
fragments
of
its
orb
were
reflected
in
the
water
bee
still
slept
the
dwarf
who
had
examined
her
came
back
on
his
crow
this
time
he
was
followed
by
a
troop
of
little
men
they
were
very
little
men
they
had
white
beards
reaching
down
to
their
knees
they
were
the
size
of
children
but
they
had
old
faces
the
leather
aprons
and
the
hammers
which
they
carried
hanging
at
their
belts
made
it
evident
they
were
they
moved
in
a
strange
way
by
jumping
to
a
great
height
and
turning
wonderful
somersaults
this
incredible
nimbleness
made
them
less
like
men
than
spirits
but
in
their
wildest
antics
their
faces
remained
unalterably
grave
so
that
it
was
impossible
to
make
out
their
real
character
they
placed
themselves
in
a
circle
round
the
sleeper
well
said
the
smallest
of
the
dwarfs
from
the
height
of
his
feathered
mount
well
i
did
not
deceive
you
when
i
warned
you
that
the
prettiest
of
princesses
was
sleeping
on
the
edge
of
the
lake
and
do
you
not
thank
me
for
having
shown
her
to
you
we
thank
you
bob
answered
one
of
the
dwarfs
who
looked
like
an
old
poet
truly
there
is
nothing
in
the
world
as
pretty
as
this
maiden
her
complexion
is
rosier
than
the
dawn
upon
the
mountains
and
the
gold
of
our
smithies
is
not
as
bright
as
that
of
her
tresses
it
is
true
pic
pic
nothing
could
be
more
true
answered
the
dwarfs
but
what
shall
we
do
with
this
pretty
maid
pic
who
resembled
an
old
poet
did
not
answer
this
question
of
the
dwarfs
because
he
did
not
know
more
than
they
did
what
to
do
with
the
pretty
maid
a
dwarf
named
rug
said
to
them
let
us
build
a
large
cage
and
we
will
shut
her
in
it
another
dwarf
named
dig
opposed
this
suggestion
of
rug
according
to
dig
only
wild
beasts
were
put
in
cages
and
as
yet
there
was
nothing
to
indicate
that
the
pretty
maiden
was
one
of
them
but
rug
was
taken
with
his
own
idea
for
want
of
another
to
put
in
its
place
he
ingeniously
defended
it
if
this
person
he
said
is
not
wild
she
will
doubtlessly
become
so
by
being
shut
in
the
cage
which
will
consequently
become
useful
and
even
indispensable
this
argument
displeased
the
dwarfs
and
one
of
them
named
tad
denounced
it
indignantly
he
was
a
dwarf
of
utmost
goodness
he
proposed
taking
back
the
beautiful
girl
to
her
parents
whom
he
thought
to
be
powerful
lords
this
view
of
the
good
tad
was
rejected
as
contrary
to
the
custom
of
the
dwarfs
justice
should
prevail
tad
went
on
to
say
and
not
custom
he
was
no
longer
listened
to
the
crowd
had
fallen
into
disorder
and
tumult
when
a
dwarf
called
paw
who
was
simple
but
sensible
gave
his
views
as
follows
we
must
first
wake
the
maiden
as
she
does
not
wake
of
herself
if
she
spends
the
night
like
this
her
eyelids
will
be
swollen
and
her
beauty
will
be
less
for
it
is
very
unhealthy
to
sleep
in
a
wood
on
the
edge
of
a
lake
this
opinion
met
with
general
approval
because
it
was
not
opposed
to
any
other
pic
who
resembled
an
old
poet
overwhelmed
with
misfortune
went
near
to
the
little
maid
and
gazed
on
her
gravely
with
the
idea
that
a
single
one
of
his
looks
would
suffice
to
rouse
the
sleeper
from
the
deepest
sleep
but
pic
the
power
of
his
eyes
and
bee
continued
to
sleep
with
her
hands
clasped
seeing
this
the
good
tad
gently
pulled
her
sleeve
then
she
opened
her
eyes
and
raised
herself
on
her
elbow
seeing
herself
on
a
surrounded
by
dwarfs
she
thought
that
what
she
saw
was
a
dream
and
she
rubbed
her
eyes
to
open
them
and
to
let
in
instead
of
this
fantastic
vision
the
bright
early
morning
light
streaming
into
her
blue
room
where
she
imagined
herself
to
be
for
her
mind
numb
with
sleep
did
not
recall
the
adventure
of
the
lake
but
rub
her
eyes
as
she
might
the
dwarfs
stayed
there
she
had
to
believe
they
were
real
then
looking
round
anxiously
she
saw
the
forest
her
memory
returned
she
cried
in
agony
george
my
brother
george
the
dwarfs
pressed
round
her
and
for
fear
of
seeing
them
she
hid
her
face
in
her
hands
george
george
where
is
my
brother
george
she
cried
sobbing
the
dwarfs
did
not
tell
her
and
for
this
reason
that
they
did
not
know
so
she
wept
bitterly
calling
on
her
mother
and
her
brother
paw
felt
inclined
to
cry
like
her
but
anxious
to
console
her
he
spoke
a
few
vague
words
do
not
alarm
yourself
he
said
it
would
be
a
pity
if
such
a
beautiful
lady
spoilt
her
eyes
by
crying
but
rather
tell
us
your
history
it
is
certain
to
be
interesting
it
would
give
us
the
very
greatest
pleasure
she
was
not
listening
she
rose
and
tried
to
run
away
but
her
swollen
naked
feet
gave
her
such
sharp
pain
that
she
fell
on
her
knee
and
burst
into
still
more
violent
sobs
tad
held
her
up
in
his
arms
and
paw
gently
kissed
her
hand
this
is
why
she
dared
to
look
and
saw
that
their
faces
were
compassionate
pic
seemed
to
be
an
inspired
but
innocent
creature
and
noticing
that
all
the
little
men
looked
upon
her
with
kindliness
she
said
to
them
little
men
it
is
a
pity
you
are
so
ugly
but
i
will
like
you
all
the
same
if
you
will
give
me
something
to
eat
for
i
am
hungry
bob
all
the
dwarfs
cried
at
the
same
time
fetch
some
supper
and
bob
went
off
on
his
crow
still
the
dwarfs
felt
that
this
little
girl
had
been
guilty
of
an
injustice
in
considering
them
ugly
rug
was
extremely
angry
pic
said
to
himself
she
is
only
a
child
and
does
not
see
the
fire
of
genius
burning
in
my
looks
so
as
to
give
them
alternately
masterful
strength
and
fascinating
grace
paw
thought
perhaps
it
would
have
been
better
not
to
wake
this
young
lady
who
considers
us
ugly
but
tad
said
smiling
you
will
consider
us
less
ugly
miss
when
you
like
us
better
at
these
words
bob
reappeared
on
his
crow
he
brought
a
roast
partridge
on
a
gold
dish
with
a
loaf
of
meal
bread
and
a
bottle
of
red
wine
he
placed
this
supper
at
the
feet
of
bee
turning
an
endless
number
of
somersaults
bee
ate
and
said
little
men
your
supper
is
very
good
my
name
is
bee
let
us
look
for
my
brother
and
go
together
to
the
clarides
where
mama
is
waiting
for
us
in
a
state
of
great
anxiety
but
dig
who
was
a
good
dwarf
urged
on
bee
that
she
was
incapable
of
walking
that
her
brother
was
old
enough
to
find
himself
that
no
accident
could
happen
to
him
in
this
country
where
all
wild
beasts
had
been
destroyed
he
added
we
will
make
a
stretcher
we
will
cover
it
with
a
litter
of
leaves
and
mosses
we
will
place
you
on
it
we
will
carry
you
thus
into
the
mountain
to
introduce
you
to
the
king
of
the
dwarfs
as
the
custom
of
our
people
requires
all
the
dwarfs
applauded
bee
looked
at
her
sore
feet
and
was
silent
she
was
relieved
to
hear
there
were
no
wild
beasts
in
the
country
in
all
other
matters
she
relied
on
the
friendship
of
the
dwarfs
already
they
were
constructing
the
stretcher
those
who
had
axes
were
hacking
away
at
the
stems
of
two
young
pines
this
revived
his
idea
in
the
head
of
rug
if
instead
of
a
stretcher
he
said
we
built
a
cage
but
he
raised
a
unanimous
protest
tad
looking
at
him
with
contempt
exclaimed
rug
you
are
more
like
a
man
than
a
dwarf
but
this
at
least
is
to
the
credit
of
our
race
that
the
wickedest
of
the
dwarfs
is
also
the
stupidest
meanwhile
the
work
went
on
the
dwarfs
leapt
in
the
air
to
reach
branches
which
they
cut
in
their
flight
and
out
of
which
they
neatly
built
a
lattice
chair
having
covered
it
with
moss
and
dry
leaves
they
made
bee
sit
there
then
all
together
they
seized
the
two
poles
up
hoisted
it
on
their
shoulders
and
swung
off
to
the
mountain
faithfully
the
welcome
given
by
king
loc
to
bee
of
the
they
ascended
the
woody
side
of
the
hill
by
a
tortuous
path
here
and
there
blocks
of
granite
bare
and
rusty
rose
in
the
grey
foliage
of
the
dwarf
oaks
and
the
rugged
landscape
was
enclosed
by
russet
hills
and
their
ravines
the
procession
preceded
by
bob
on
his
winged
steed
entered
a
cleft
of
the
rocks
hung
with
briar
bee
with
her
golden
hair
scattered
on
her
shoulders
looked
like
the
dawn
risen
on
the
mountains
if
it
is
true
that
sometimes
the
dawn
gets
frightened
calls
for
her
mother
and
tries
to
run
away
for
these
three
events
occurred
when
the
little
girl
dimly
saw
dwarfs
terribly
armed
lurking
in
all
crevices
of
the
cliff
they
held
themselves
motionless
with
their
bows
strung
and
levelled
lances
their
tunics
of
hide
and
long
knives
hanging
at
their
belts
gave
them
a
terrible
appearance
game
of
fur
and
feather
lay
at
their
feet
but
these
hunters
as
far
as
their
faces
went
did
not
look
fierce
on
the
contrary
they
seemed
mild
and
grave
like
the
dwarfs
of
the
forest
whom
they
very
much
resembled
upright
in
their
midst
stood
a
dwarf
of
great
majesty
he
wore
a
cock
s
feather
at
his
ear
and
on
his
forehead
a
diadem
studded
with
enormous
jewels
his
mantle
was
flung
over
his
shoulder
showing
a
robust
arm
loaded
with
gold
rings
a
bugle
of
ivory
and
carved
silver
hung
at
his
belt
he
leant
his
left
hand
upon
his
lance
in
an
attitude
of
repose
and
strength
and
with
the
right
he
shielded
his
eye
to
look
towards
bee
and
the
light
king
loc
the
dwarfs
of
the
forest
said
to
him
we
bring
you
the
beautiful
little
girl
we
have
found
her
name
is
bee
you
do
right
said
king
loc
she
will
live
among
us
as
the
custom
of
the
dwarfs
requires
then
advancing
to
bee
bee
he
said
to
her
welcome
he
spoke
gently
to
her
for
already
his
feelings
towards
her
were
friendly
he
stood
on
tiptoe
to
kiss
her
hand
which
hung
down
and
her
that
not
only
should
no
kind
of
harm
happen
to
her
but
that
all
her
wishes
should
be
satisfied
even
if
she
should
ask
for
necklaces
mirrors
wool
of
cashmere
and
silks
of
china
i
would
very
much
like
some
slippers
answered
bee
then
king
loc
struck
a
gong
of
bronze
which
hung
to
the
walls
of
rock
with
his
lance
and
immediately
something
was
seen
coming
from
the
end
of
the
cavern
bounding
like
a
ball
it
grew
bigger
till
it
became
a
dwarf
the
features
of
whose
face
recalled
those
given
by
painters
to
the
illustrious
belisarius
but
whose
leather
apron
showed
him
to
be
a
bootmaker
as
a
matter
of
fact
it
was
the
chief
bootmaker
true
said
the
king
to
him
choose
in
our
store
the
most
supple
leather
take
cloth
of
gold
and
silver
ask
the
keeper
of
my
treasures
for
a
thousand
pearls
of
the
finest
water
and
construct
a
pair
of
slippers
for
little
bee
out
of
the
leather
the
tissues
and
the
pearls
at
these
words
true
threw
himself
at
the
feet
of
bee
and
measured
them
accurately
but
she
said
little
king
loc
you
must
give
me
the
beautiful
slippers
you
have
promised
me
directly
and
when
i
have
them
i
will
return
to
my
mother
at
the
clarides
you
will
have
your
slippers
bee
answered
king
loc
you
will
have
them
to
walk
about
inside
the
mountain
and
not
to
return
to
the
clarides
for
you
can
not
leave
this
kingdom
where
you
will
learn
beautiful
secrets
that
are
unguessed
upon
the
earth
dwarfs
are
superior
to
men
and
it
is
for
your
happiness
that
you
have
been
found
by
them
it
is
for
my
unhappiness
answered
bee
little
king
loc
give
me
wooden
shoes
like
those
worn
by
peasants
and
let
me
return
to
the
clarides
but
king
loc
shook
his
head
to
express
that
it
was
not
possible
then
bee
clasped
her
hands
and
sweetened
her
voice
little
king
loc
let
me
go
and
i
will
love
you
you
will
forget
me
bee
on
the
sunny
earth
little
king
loc
i
will
not
forget
you
and
i
will
love
you
as
much
as
and
who
is
my
pony
he
has
a
pink
bridle
and
eats
out
of
my
hand
when
he
was
small
the
squire
freeheart
used
to
bring
him
up
to
my
room
of
a
morning
and
i
used
to
kiss
him
but
now
freeheart
is
at
rome
and
is
too
big
to
go
upstairs
king
loc
smiled
bee
will
you
love
me
more
than
i
will
that
is
right
i
will
but
i
can
not
i
hate
you
little
king
loc
because
you
prevent
me
seeing
my
mother
and
george
again
who
is
george
george
is
george
and
i
like
him
the
friendship
of
king
loc
for
bee
had
largely
increased
in
a
few
moments
and
as
he
already
hoped
to
marry
her
when
she
was
of
age
and
through
her
to
reconcile
men
and
dwarfs
he
feared
that
george
might
at
some
time
become
his
rival
and
disturb
his
plans
this
is
why
he
knit
his
eyebrows
and
walked
off
drooping
his
head
like
a
worried
man
bee
seeing
she
had
vexed
him
gently
plucked
at
the
skirt
of
his
coat
little
king
loc
she
said
in
a
sad
and
tender
voice
why
do
we
each
of
us
make
the
other
unhappy
bee
it
is
the
fault
of
circumstances
answered
king
loc
i
can
not
take
you
back
to
your
mother
but
i
will
send
her
a
dream
which
will
inform
her
of
your
fate
dear
bee
and
console
her
little
king
loc
answered
bee
smiling
through
her
tears
you
have
had
a
good
idea
but
i
will
tell
you
what
you
ought
to
do
every
night
you
ought
to
send
my
mother
a
dream
in
which
she
will
see
me
and
send
me
a
dream
in
which
i
will
see
my
mother
king
loc
promised
to
do
so
and
what
he
said
he
did
each
night
bee
saw
her
mother
and
each
night
the
duchess
saw
her
daughter
this
satisfied
their
affection
a
little
which
the
wonders
of
the
kingdom
of
the
dwarfs
are
thoroughly
described
as
well
as
the
dolls
which
were
given
to
the
kingdom
of
the
dwarfs
was
deep
and
stretched
under
a
great
part
of
the
earth
though
the
sky
was
only
visible
here
and
there
through
openings
in
the
rock
the
open
places
the
roads
the
palaces
and
hall
were
not
buried
in
the
thickest
night
only
a
few
rooms
and
several
caverns
remained
in
darkness
the
others
were
lighted
not
by
lamps
and
torches
but
by
planets
and
meteors
which
shed
a
wild
fantastic
brightness
and
this
brightness
shone
upon
strange
marvels
enormous
buildings
had
been
hewn
in
the
face
of
the
rock
in
certain
places
palaces
cut
out
of
granite
rose
to
such
a
height
up
under
the
vaults
of
the
huge
caverns
that
their
stone
carvings
disappeared
in
a
mist
pierced
by
the
yellowish
light
of
little
planets
less
luminous
than
the
moon
there
were
in
those
kingdoms
fortresses
of
stupendous
mass
amphitheatres
whose
stone
tiers
formed
a
semicircle
which
the
eye
could
not
embrace
in
its
full
extent
and
vast
wells
with
sculptured
sides
in
which
no
plummet
could
ever
have
found
a
bottom
all
these
structures
apparently
unsuited
to
the
stature
of
their
inhabitants
agreed
perfectly
with
their
quaint
fantastic
turn
of
mind
the
dwarfs
wrapped
in
hoods
with
sprigs
of
stuck
in
them
moved
about
these
buildings
with
the
nimbleness
of
spirits
it
was
quite
common
to
see
one
jump
from
the
height
of
two
or
three
stories
on
to
the
lava
pavement
and
rebound
like
a
ball
his
face
retained
in
the
act
that
calm
majestic
expression
which
sculptors
give
to
the
heads
of
ancient
great
men
there
was
no
indolence
and
all
applied
themselves
to
their
work
whole
quarters
resounded
with
the
noise
of
hammers
the
shrieks
of
machinery
echoed
against
the
cavern
roofs
and
it
was
a
curious
sight
to
see
the
crowd
of
miners
smiths
goldbeaters
jewellers
diamond
polishers
handle
their
pickaxes
hammers
pincers
and
files
with
the
dexterity
of
monkeys
but
there
was
a
more
peaceful
quarter
there
uncouth
and
huge
figures
shapeless
pillars
dimly
projected
from
the
rough
stone
they
seemed
to
be
aged
and
venerable
there
rose
a
squat
palace
with
low
doors
it
was
the
palace
of
king
loc
just
opposite
was
the
house
of
bee
house
or
rather
cottage
with
only
one
room
in
it
and
this
was
hung
with
white
muslin
furniture
spread
its
pleasant
scent
in
the
room
a
cleft
in
the
rock
let
in
the
light
of
the
sky
and
on
fine
nights
stars
were
visible
bee
had
no
special
servants
but
the
whole
dwarf
nation
struggled
in
emulation
to
supply
all
her
needs
and
anticipate
all
her
wishes
except
that
of
reascending
above
ground
the
most
learned
dwarfs
who
possess
great
secrets
took
pleasure
in
teaching
her
not
with
books
for
dwarfs
do
not
write
but
by
showing
her
all
the
plants
of
the
mountains
and
the
valleys
the
different
kinds
of
animals
and
the
various
stones
which
are
drawn
from
the
bosom
of
the
earth
and
it
was
by
sights
and
examples
that
they
with
their
gay
simplicity
taught
her
the
wonders
of
nature
and
the
methods
of
art
they
made
toys
for
her
such
as
no
rich
children
on
the
earth
have
ever
had
for
these
dwarfs
were
capable
and
invented
marvellous
machines
in
those
depths
they
put
together
for
her
dolls
that
could
move
with
grace
and
express
themselves
according
to
the
rule
of
poetry
when
assembled
in
a
little
theatre
of
which
the
scenery
represented
the
sea
shore
the
blue
sky
palaces
and
temples
these
dolls
played
tragedies
of
surpassing
interest
though
they
were
not
much
longer
than
a
man
s
arm
they
looked
exactly
some
like
reverend
old
men
others
like
men
in
the
prime
of
life
or
like
lovely
maidens
dressed
in
white
robes
there
were
also
among
them
mothers
clasping
to
their
bosoms
innocent
little
children
and
these
eloquent
dolls
spoke
and
acted
on
the
stage
as
if
they
were
moved
by
hatred
love
or
ambition
they
passed
cleverly
from
joy
to
grief
and
so
well
did
they
imitate
nature
that
they
raised
smiles
or
drew
tears
bee
clapped
her
hands
at
the
show
the
dolls
who
aimed
at
tyranny
made
her
shudder
with
disgust
on
the
other
hand
she
poured
treasures
of
compassion
on
the
doll
who
once
a
princess
now
a
widow
and
a
captive
her
head
crowned
with
cypress
has
no
other
means
of
saving
the
life
of
her
child
than
marrying
alas
the
barbarian
who
made
her
a
widow
bee
never
grew
tired
of
this
game
in
which
the
dolls
introduced
infinite
variety
the
dwarfs
also
gave
concerts
for
her
and
taught
her
to
play
the
lute
the
viola
the
theorbo
the
lyre
and
divers
other
kinds
of
instruments
in
such
a
fashion
she
became
a
good
musician
and
the
plays
represented
by
the
dolls
gave
her
an
experience
of
men
and
life
king
loc
was
present
at
these
plays
and
concerts
but
he
saw
and
heard
no
one
else
but
bee
and
his
whole
soul
was
gradually
drawn
towards
her
meanwhile
days
and
months
passed
years
made
their
round
and
still
bee
stayed
among
the
dwarfs
incessantly
amused
and
always
full
of
regret
for
the
earth
she
was
growing
into
a
beautiful
young
woman
her
strange
fate
gave
a
touch
of
strangeness
to
her
face
only
adding
to
it
another
charm
which
the
treasure
of
king
loc
is
described
as
well
as
bee
had
been
among
the
dwarfs
for
six
years
to
a
day
king
loc
summoned
her
to
his
palace
and
ordered
his
treasurer
in
her
presence
to
displace
a
large
stone
which
seemed
fixed
in
the
wall
but
which
was
in
reality
only
inserted
into
it
they
all
three
passed
through
the
opening
left
by
the
removal
of
the
large
stone
and
found
themselves
in
a
crevice
of
the
rock
where
two
people
could
not
walk
abreast
king
loc
went
forward
first
along
the
dark
path
and
bee
followed
holding
on
to
the
skirt
of
the
royal
mantle
they
went
on
walking
for
a
long
time
at
times
the
walls
of
rock
came
so
close
together
that
the
girl
was
afraid
of
being
caught
between
them
without
being
able
to
move
forward
or
back
and
of
dying
there
but
the
mantle
of
king
loc
sped
before
her
along
the
dark
and
narrow
path
at
last
king
loc
found
a
bronze
door
which
he
opened
and
there
was
a
flood
of
light
little
king
loc
cried
bee
i
never
knew
before
that
light
was
such
a
beautiful
thing
but
king
loc
taking
her
by
the
hand
led
her
into
the
hall
from
which
the
light
came
and
said
to
her
look
bee
dazzled
at
first
saw
nothing
for
this
huge
hall
resting
on
high
marble
pillars
was
from
the
floor
to
the
roof
all
glorious
with
gold
at
the
far
end
on
a
dais
made
of
sparkling
gems
enchased
in
gold
and
in
silver
and
the
steps
of
which
were
covered
by
a
carpet
of
marvellous
embroidery
was
set
a
throne
of
ivory
and
gold
with
a
canopy
of
translucent
enamels
at
its
side
two
three
thousand
years
old
rose
from
two
gigantic
vessels
carved
long
ago
by
the
best
craftsmen
of
the
dwarfs
king
loc
sat
down
on
this
throne
and
made
the
young
girl
stand
on
his
right
hand
bee
he
said
to
her
this
is
my
treasure
choose
whatever
you
like
immense
shields
of
gold
hung
to
the
pillars
caught
the
sunbeams
and
flung
them
back
in
dazzling
showers
crossed
swords
and
lances
hung
flaming
their
bright
points
the
tables
which
spread
close
to
the
walls
were
loaded
with
bowls
flagons
ewers
chalices
pyxes
patins
goblets
beakers
with
of
ivory
ringed
with
silver
with
enormous
bottles
of
rock
crystals
dishes
of
carved
gold
and
silver
with
coffers
with
reliquaries
in
the
shape
of
churches
with
mirrors
with
candelabra
and
censers
as
wonderful
for
their
workmanship
as
for
their
material
and
with
thuribles
in
the
shape
of
monsters
and
on
one
of
the
tables
a
game
of
chess
made
of
moonstones
was
spread
out
choose
bee
king
loc
repeated
but
raising
her
eyes
above
these
riches
bee
saw
the
blue
sky
through
an
opening
in
the
roof
and
as
if
she
had
understood
that
the
light
of
the
sky
alone
gave
these
things
their
brightness
she
only
said
little
king
loc
i
would
like
to
go
back
to
earth
then
king
loc
made
a
sign
to
his
treasurer
who
lifting
some
heavy
curtains
showed
a
huge
coffer
barred
with
plates
and
patterns
of
iron
the
coffer
being
open
there
streamed
from
it
a
thousand
beams
of
various
and
charming
colours
each
of
these
beams
sprang
from
a
precious
stone
cunningly
cut
king
loc
dipped
his
hand
in
them
and
they
saw
rolling
in
luminous
confusion
the
violet
amethyst
and
the
maiden
stone
the
emerald
of
three
natures
the
one
dark
green
the
other
called
the
honeyed
emerald
because
it
is
of
the
colour
of
honey
the
third
of
a
called
beryl
which
bestows
beautiful
dreams
the
eastern
topaz
the
ruby
beautiful
as
the
blood
of
brave
men
the
dark
blue
sapphire
called
the
male
sapphire
and
the
pale
blue
sapphire
called
the
female
sapphire
the
alexandrite
the
hyacinth
the
turquoise
the
opal
whose
lights
are
softer
than
those
of
the
dawn
the
hyalite
and
the
syrian
garnet
all
the
stones
were
of
the
most
limpid
water
and
the
most
luminous
colour
and
big
diamonds
cast
their
dazzling
white
lights
among
these
coloured
fires
bee
choose
said
king
loc
but
bee
shook
her
head
and
said
little
king
loc
i
prefer
a
single
one
of
the
sunbeams
which
strike
the
slates
of
the
castle
of
the
clarides
to
all
these
jewels
then
king
loc
had
a
second
coffer
opened
which
held
nothing
but
pearls
but
all
these
pearls
were
round
and
pure
their
changing
lights
took
on
all
the
tints
of
the
sky
and
the
sea
and
their
glow
was
so
mild
that
it
seemed
to
express
a
lovely
thought
take
some
said
king
loc
but
bee
answered
him
little
king
loc
these
pearls
remind
me
of
the
looks
of
george
of
the
white
moor
i
like
these
pearls
but
i
like
the
eyes
of
george
better
hearing
these
words
king
loc
turned
away
his
head
yet
he
opened
a
third
coffer
and
showed
the
young
girl
a
crystal
in
which
a
drop
of
water
had
been
a
prisoner
since
the
earliest
time
of
the
world
and
when
shaken
the
crystal
showed
this
drop
of
water
moving
he
also
displayed
to
her
pieces
of
yellow
amber
in
which
insects
more
dazzling
than
jewels
had
been
taken
for
millions
of
years
their
delicate
legs
and
frail
membranes
were
distinguishable
and
they
would
have
taken
wing
again
if
some
power
had
melted
like
ice
their
scented
these
are
great
natural
curiosities
i
give
them
to
you
bee
but
bee
answered
little
king
loc
keep
the
amber
and
the
crystal
for
i
could
not
give
back
their
liberty
either
to
the
fly
or
the
drop
of
water
king
loc
looked
at
her
for
a
time
and
said
bee
the
richest
treasures
will
be
well
placed
in
your
hands
you
will
possess
them
and
they
will
not
possess
you
the
greedy
are
the
prey
of
their
own
gold
only
those
who
despise
wealth
can
possess
it
with
safety
their
souls
will
always
be
greater
than
their
fortune
having
thus
spoken
he
made
a
sign
to
his
treasurer
who
presented
a
crown
of
gold
on
a
cushion
to
the
young
girl
receive
this
jewel
as
a
sign
of
the
esteem
we
have
for
you
bee
said
king
loc
henceforward
you
will
be
called
the
princess
of
the
dwarfs
and
he
himself
placed
the
crown
on
the
brow
of
bee
which
king
loc
the
dwarfs
celebrated
the
coronation
of
their
first
princess
by
festivals
and
rejoicings
in
their
perfect
simplicity
they
played
games
at
random
in
the
huge
amphitheatre
and
the
little
men
with
a
sprig
of
fern
or
two
oak
leaves
neatly
fixed
in
their
hood
went
leaping
joyfully
along
the
subterranean
streets
the
rejoicings
lasted
thirty
days
in
his
intoxication
pic
had
the
look
of
an
inspired
mortal
the
good
tad
was
enraptured
with
the
general
happiness
the
tender
dig
gave
himself
the
pleasure
of
shedding
tears
rug
in
his
joy
again
proposed
that
bee
should
be
put
in
a
cage
that
the
dwarfs
might
not
fear
losing
so
delightful
a
princess
bob
riding
on
his
crow
filled
the
air
with
such
joyful
cries
that
the
bird
itself
grew
merry
and
gave
forth
wild
little
croaks
king
loc
alone
was
sad
it
came
to
pass
that
on
the
thirtieth
day
having
entertained
the
princess
and
the
whole
nation
of
the
dwarfs
at
a
splendid
feast
he
stood
upon
his
and
his
kind
face
being
thus
raised
to
the
level
of
bee
s
ear
princess
bee
he
said
to
her
i
am
going
to
make
a
request
which
you
have
full
liberty
to
grant
or
to
refuse
bee
of
the
clarides
princess
of
the
dwarfs
will
you
be
my
wife
and
speaking
thus
king
loc
grave
and
tender
looked
as
handsome
and
mild
as
a
majestic
poodle
bee
pulled
his
beard
and
answered
him
little
king
loc
i
am
willing
to
be
your
wife
for
fun
but
i
will
never
be
your
wife
seriously
when
you
propose
to
marry
me
you
make
me
think
of
freeheart
who
on
the
earth
used
to
tell
me
the
most
incredible
tales
to
amuse
me
at
these
words
king
loc
turned
away
his
head
but
too
slowly
for
bee
not
to
see
a
tear
caught
in
the
eyelashes
of
the
dwarf
then
bee
was
sorry
she
had
hurt
him
little
king
loc
she
said
to
him
i
love
you
like
a
little
king
loc
that
you
are
and
if
you
make
me
laugh
as
freeheart
used
to
that
ought
not
to
annoy
you
for
freeheart
sang
very
well
and
would
have
been
without
his
grey
hair
and
red
nose
king
loc
answered
her
bee
of
the
clarides
princess
of
the
dwarfs
i
love
you
in
the
hope
that
you
will
one
day
love
me
but
had
i
not
that
hope
i
would
love
you
just
as
much
i
request
you
in
return
for
my
friendship
always
to
be
sincere
with
me
little
king
loc
i
promise
you
i
will
well
bee
tell
me
if
you
love
any
one
enough
to
marry
him
little
king
loc
i
love
no
one
as
much
as
that
then
king
loc
smiled
and
seizing
his
golden
goblet
he
proposed
in
ringing
tones
the
health
of
the
princess
of
the
dwarfs
and
a
vast
murmur
rose
from
the
depths
of
the
earth
for
the
table
at
which
they
feasted
stretched
from
one
end
to
the
other
of
the
dwarfish
empire
how
bee
saw
her
mother
and
could
not
kiss
bee
with
a
crown
set
on
her
forehead
was
more
pensive
and
more
sad
than
in
those
days
when
her
hair
flowed
unbound
on
her
shoulders
and
when
she
went
laughing
to
the
smithy
of
the
dwarfs
to
pull
the
beards
of
her
good
friends
pic
tad
and
dig
whose
faces
reddened
by
the
glow
of
the
flames
grew
merry
at
her
welcome
the
good
dwarfs
who
once
used
to
dandle
her
on
their
knees
and
call
her
their
bee
now
bowed
at
her
approach
and
kept
deferentially
silent
she
regretted
she
was
no
longer
a
child
and
she
was
oppressed
by
being
the
princess
of
the
dwarfs
it
no
longer
gave
her
any
pleasure
to
see
king
loc
since
she
had
seen
him
cry
on
her
account
but
she
liked
him
for
he
was
kind
and
he
was
unhappy
one
day
if
it
can
be
said
that
there
are
days
in
the
empire
of
the
dwarfs
she
took
king
loc
by
the
hand
and
drew
him
to
the
fissure
of
the
rock
admitting
a
beam
in
which
golden
motes
danced
gaily
little
king
loc
she
said
to
him
i
am
in
pain
you
are
also
a
king
you
love
me
and
i
am
in
pain
hearing
these
words
of
the
beautiful
maiden
king
loc
answered
i
love
you
bee
of
the
clarides
princess
of
the
dwarfs
and
this
is
why
i
have
kept
you
in
this
our
world
so
as
to
teach
you
our
secrets
which
are
more
great
and
wonderful
than
anything
you
can
learn
on
earth
among
men
for
men
are
less
clever
and
less
learned
than
dwarfs
yes
said
bee
but
they
are
more
like
me
than
the
dwarfs
that
is
why
i
like
them
better
little
king
loc
let
me
see
my
mother
again
if
you
do
not
wish
me
to
die
king
loc
walked
away
without
answering
bee
alone
and
dejected
gazed
on
the
beam
of
that
light
which
bathes
the
whole
face
of
the
earth
and
pours
its
radiant
floods
on
all
living
men
and
even
on
the
beggars
that
tramp
the
roads
slowly
the
beam
grew
faint
and
changed
its
golden
splendour
into
a
pale
blue
light
night
had
come
upon
earth
a
star
glittered
through
the
fissure
in
the
rock
then
some
one
touched
her
on
the
shoulder
and
she
saw
king
loc
wrapped
in
a
black
mantle
on
his
arm
hung
another
mantle
which
he
put
round
the
girl
come
he
said
to
her
and
he
led
her
from
underground
when
she
again
saw
the
trees
swept
by
the
wind
the
clouds
racing
over
the
moon
and
the
whole
of
the
fresh
blue
night
when
she
smelt
the
scent
of
the
grasses
and
took
to
her
bosom
in
a
flood
the
air
she
had
breathed
during
her
childhood
she
gave
a
great
sigh
and
thought
to
die
of
joy
king
loc
had
taken
her
in
his
arms
small
as
he
was
he
carried
her
as
easily
as
a
feather
and
the
two
went
gliding
over
the
earth
like
the
shadow
of
two
birds
bee
you
are
going
to
see
your
mother
again
but
listen
every
night
as
you
know
i
send
your
image
to
your
mother
every
night
she
sees
your
dear
shape
she
smiles
and
speaks
to
it
and
kisses
it
i
am
going
to
show
you
instead
of
your
ghost
you
will
see
her
but
do
not
touch
her
do
not
speak
of
her
for
then
the
charm
would
be
broken
and
she
will
never
again
see
you
nor
your
image
which
she
does
not
distinguish
from
yourself
i
will
therefore
be
careful
alas
little
king
loc
there
it
is
there
it
is
there
was
the
keep
of
the
clarides
rising
black
on
the
hill
bee
hardly
had
time
to
send
a
kiss
to
the
old
stones
now
she
saw
blooming
with
gilliflowers
the
ramparts
of
the
town
of
the
clarides
fly
past
her
now
she
was
going
up
along
a
slope
where
shone
in
the
grass
to
the
postern
gate
which
king
loc
opened
easily
for
the
dwarfs
the
metal
workers
are
not
stopped
by
locks
padlocks
bolts
chains
and
bars
she
went
up
the
spiral
staircase
leading
to
her
mother
s
room
and
stopped
to
put
her
two
hands
to
her
beating
heart
the
door
opened
slowly
and
by
the
light
of
a
lamp
hung
from
the
ceiling
bee
saw
in
the
brooding
religious
silence
her
mother
worn
and
pale
her
hair
silvered
at
the
temples
but
more
beautiful
thus
for
her
daughter
than
in
the
days
gone
by
of
splendid
jewels
and
fearless
rides
as
the
mother
saw
her
daughter
in
a
dream
she
opened
her
arms
to
embrace
her
and
the
child
laughing
and
sobbing
tried
to
cast
herself
into
these
open
arms
but
king
loc
tore
her
from
this
embrace
and
carried
her
off
like
a
straw
over
the
dark
champaign
down
into
the
kingdom
of
the
dwarfs
which
the
great
grief
that
overtook
king
loc
is
bee
seated
on
the
granite
steps
of
the
subterranean
palace
again
gazed
at
the
blue
sky
through
the
fissure
in
the
stone
high
above
the
elder
trees
turned
their
white
umbels
towards
the
light
bee
began
to
cry
king
loc
took
her
by
the
hand
and
said
to
her
bee
why
are
you
crying
and
what
do
you
want
and
as
she
had
been
sad
for
several
days
the
dwarfs
seated
at
her
feet
were
playing
to
her
very
simple
tunes
on
the
flute
the
flageolet
the
rebec
and
the
cymbals
other
dwarfs
turned
to
please
her
such
somersaults
that
one
after
the
other
they
stuck
in
the
ground
the
tips
of
their
hoods
decorated
with
a
plume
of
leaves
nothing
could
be
more
diverting
to
see
than
the
sports
of
these
little
men
with
their
hermit
beards
the
good
tad
the
romantic
dig
who
loved
her
from
the
day
they
had
seen
her
sleeping
on
the
edge
of
the
lake
and
pic
the
old
poet
took
her
gently
by
the
arm
and
begged
her
to
tell
them
the
secret
of
her
grief
paw
who
was
simple
but
sensible
held
up
to
her
grapes
in
a
basket
and
all
tugging
the
edge
of
her
dress
repeated
with
king
loc
bee
princess
of
the
dwarfs
why
are
you
weeping
bee
answered
little
king
loc
and
you
all
little
men
my
grief
increases
your
grief
because
you
are
kind
you
weep
when
i
weep
know
that
i
weep
thinking
of
george
of
the
white
moor
who
must
be
a
brave
knight
and
whom
i
shall
never
see
again
i
love
him
and
i
wish
to
be
his
wife
king
loc
drew
his
hand
from
the
hand
he
was
pressing
and
said
bee
why
did
you
deceive
me
and
tell
me
at
the
feast
table
that
you
loved
no
one
bee
answered
little
king
loc
i
did
not
deceive
you
at
the
feast
table
i
did
not
then
wish
to
marry
george
of
the
white
moor
and
it
is
my
highest
desire
that
he
should
propose
to
marry
me
but
he
will
not
propose
since
i
do
not
know
where
he
is
and
he
does
not
know
where
to
find
me
and
this
is
why
i
cry
at
these
words
the
musicians
stopped
playing
their
instruments
the
leapers
interrupted
their
leaps
and
remained
motionless
on
their
heads
or
their
seats
tad
and
dig
shed
silent
tears
on
bee
s
sleeve
the
simple
paw
let
drop
the
basket
with
the
bunches
of
grapes
and
all
the
little
men
gave
fearful
groans
but
the
king
of
the
dwarfs
more
dejected
than
all
of
them
under
his
crown
of
sparkling
stones
walked
away
without
a
word
letting
his
mantle
drag
behind
him
like
a
torrent
of
purple
the
words
of
the
learned
nur
which
gave
an
extraordinary
pleasure
to
little
king
king
loc
had
not
shown
his
weakness
to
the
maiden
but
when
he
was
alone
he
sat
on
the
ground
and
holding
his
feet
in
his
hands
he
gave
way
to
grief
he
was
jealous
and
he
said
to
himself
she
is
in
love
and
it
is
not
with
me
yet
i
am
a
king
and
am
full
of
learning
i
have
treasures
i
know
marvellous
secrets
i
am
better
than
all
the
other
dwarfs
who
are
superior
to
men
she
does
not
love
me
and
she
loves
a
young
man
who
has
not
the
learning
of
the
dwarfs
and
who
perhaps
has
none
at
all
clearly
she
does
not
appreciate
merit
and
is
silly
i
ought
to
laugh
at
her
want
of
sense
but
i
love
her
and
nothing
in
the
world
pleases
me
because
she
does
not
love
me
for
many
long
days
king
loc
wandered
alone
in
the
wildest
gorges
of
the
mountains
revolving
in
his
mind
sad
and
sometimes
wicked
ideas
he
thought
of
compelling
bee
by
captivity
and
hunger
to
become
his
wife
but
discarding
the
idea
almost
as
soon
as
he
had
formed
it
he
determined
to
go
to
the
girl
and
to
throw
himself
at
her
feet
still
he
could
not
make
up
his
mind
and
did
not
know
what
to
do
for
truly
the
power
was
not
given
to
him
to
make
bee
love
him
his
anger
turned
all
at
once
against
george
of
the
white
moor
he
hoped
that
this
young
man
would
be
carried
far
away
by
a
magician
or
at
least
if
he
should
ever
be
acquainted
with
bee
s
love
that
he
would
disdain
it
and
the
king
thought
without
being
old
i
have
already
lived
too
long
not
to
have
suffered
at
times
but
my
suffering
deep
as
it
was
was
never
so
fierce
as
what
i
undergo
these
former
pains
being
caused
by
tenderness
or
by
pity
had
something
of
their
heavenly
gentleness
on
the
contrary
i
feel
at
this
hour
that
my
grief
has
the
blackness
and
bitterness
of
a
bad
passion
my
soul
is
arid
and
my
eyes
swim
in
tears
as
in
a
burning
acid
so
thought
king
loc
and
dreading
that
jealousy
should
make
him
unjust
and
wicked
he
avoided
meeting
the
young
girl
for
fear
of
using
without
wishing
to
the
tone
of
a
weak
or
violent
man
one
day
being
more
than
ordinarily
tortured
by
the
thought
that
bee
loved
george
he
determined
to
consult
nur
who
was
the
most
learned
of
the
dwarfs
and
lived
in
the
bottom
of
a
well
dug
in
the
entrails
of
the
earth
this
well
had
the
advantage
of
an
even
mild
temperature
it
was
not
dark
for
two
little
planets
a
pale
sun
and
red
moon
alternately
gave
light
to
every
part
of
it
king
loc
went
down
this
well
and
found
nur
in
his
laboratory
nur
had
the
face
of
a
pleasant
old
little
man
and
carried
a
wisp
of
wild
thyme
in
his
hood
in
spite
of
his
learning
he
showed
in
all
matters
the
innocence
and
candour
of
his
race
nur
said
the
king
embracing
him
i
have
come
to
consult
you
because
you
know
many
things
king
loc
answered
nur
i
might
know
many
things
and
yet
be
only
a
fool
but
i
know
the
way
to
learn
a
few
of
the
innumerable
things
i
do
not
know
and
this
is
why
i
am
justly
renowned
as
a
man
of
learning
well
continued
loc
do
you
know
where
a
boy
called
george
of
the
white
moor
is
now
i
do
not
know
and
i
have
never
had
the
curiosity
to
learn
answered
nur
knowing
how
ignorant
stupid
and
wicked
men
are
i
do
not
care
much
what
they
think
or
what
they
do
except
that
to
give
some
value
to
the
life
of
the
proud
and
wretched
race
the
men
have
courage
the
women
beauty
and
the
little
children
innocence
o
king
loc
the
whole
of
mankind
is
lamentable
or
ridiculous
subject
like
the
dwarfs
to
the
necessity
of
working
to
live
men
have
rebelled
against
the
divine
law
and
far
from
being
like
us
workmen
full
of
jubilance
they
prefer
war
to
work
and
would
rather
kill
than
help
each
other
but
one
must
acknowledge
to
be
just
that
the
brevity
of
their
life
is
the
principal
cause
of
their
ignorance
and
their
ferocity
they
live
too
short
a
time
for
them
to
learn
how
to
live
the
dwarf
race
which
lives
under
the
earth
is
happier
and
better
if
we
are
not
immortal
at
least
each
of
us
will
last
as
long
as
the
earth
which
carries
us
in
its
bosom
and
pervades
us
with
its
inmost
fruitful
warmth
while
for
the
race
which
is
born
on
its
rough
rind
its
breath
is
burning
or
icy
spreading
death
as
well
as
life
however
men
are
indebted
to
their
extreme
misery
and
wretchedness
for
a
quality
which
makes
the
soul
of
some
of
them
more
beautiful
than
the
soul
of
the
dwarfs
this
quality
as
splendid
to
the
mind
as
the
mild
sheen
of
pearls
to
the
eye
king
loc
is
compassion
suffering
teaches
it
and
the
dwarfs
do
not
know
it
well
because
being
wiser
than
men
they
have
fewer
sorrows
so
the
dwarfs
sometimes
leave
their
deep
grottoes
and
mix
with
men
on
the
inclement
rind
of
the
earth
in
order
to
love
them
to
suffer
with
them
and
through
them
and
then
to
taste
compassion
which
falls
on
the
soul
like
a
heavenly
refreshing
dew
such
is
the
truth
about
men
king
loc
but
did
you
not
ask
me
for
the
particular
fate
of
one
of
them
king
loc
having
repeated
his
question
the
old
nur
looked
into
one
of
the
glasses
that
filled
the
room
for
the
dwarfs
have
no
books
those
found
among
them
come
from
man
and
are
used
as
toys
to
instruct
themselves
they
do
not
refer
as
we
do
to
signs
made
upon
paper
they
look
into
the
glasses
and
see
the
subject
of
their
researches
the
only
difficulty
is
to
select
the
proper
glass
and
direct
it
rightly
these
glasses
are
of
crystal
also
of
topaz
and
opal
but
those
which
have
a
big
polished
diamond
as
lens
are
the
most
powerful
and
are
used
to
see
very
distant
things
the
dwarfs
also
have
lenses
of
a
diaphanous
substance
unknown
to
men
these
allow
the
eye
to
pierce
through
walls
and
rocks
as
if
they
were
glass
others
more
wonderful
still
reproduce
as
faithfully
as
a
mirror
all
that
time
has
carried
away
in
its
course
for
the
dwarfs
can
recall
from
the
infinite
vastness
of
the
ether
back
into
their
cavern
the
light
of
former
days
together
with
the
shapes
and
colours
of
vanished
ages
they
enjoy
this
view
of
the
past
by
collecting
the
showers
of
light
which
having
once
fallen
against
the
forms
of
men
of
beasts
of
plants
and
of
rocks
recoil
through
the
immeasurable
ether
for
all
time
the
old
nur
excelled
in
reviving
the
shapes
of
the
past
and
even
those
impossible
to
imagine
which
existed
before
the
earth
had
taken
upon
it
the
aspect
which
we
know
so
it
was
mere
play
for
him
to
find
george
of
the
white
moor
having
looked
for
less
than
a
minute
in
quite
a
simple
glass
he
said
to
king
loc
king
loc
he
whom
you
seek
is
now
among
the
sylphs
in
the
manor
of
crystal
from
which
none
return
and
whose
iridescent
walls
march
with
your
kingdom
he
is
there
is
he
let
him
stop
there
cried
king
loc
rubbing
his
hands
and
having
embraced
the
old
nur
he
went
out
of
the
well
in
peals
of
laughter
all
along
the
road
he
held
his
sides
to
laugh
at
his
ease
his
head
wagged
with
mirth
his
beard
rose
and
fell
on
his
chest
ha
ha
ha
ha
ha
ha
ha
the
little
men
who
met
him
also
began
to
laugh
like
him
out
of
sympathy
seeing
them
laugh
others
laughed
too
this
laughter
spread
from
one
to
another
till
the
whole
inside
of
the
earth
was
shaken
with
a
jovial
great
guffaw
the
marvellous
adventure
of
george
of
the
white
king
loc
did
not
laugh
long
on
the
contrary
he
hid
the
face
of
a
very
unhappy
little
man
under
his
bedclothes
thinking
of
george
of
the
white
moor
prisoner
of
the
sylphs
he
could
not
sleep
the
whole
night
so
at
that
hour
of
the
morning
when
the
dwarfs
who
have
a
dairymaid
for
a
friend
go
to
milk
the
cows
in
her
place
while
she
sleeps
like
a
log
in
her
white
bed
little
king
loc
revisited
nur
in
his
deep
well
nur
he
said
to
him
you
did
not
tell
me
what
he
was
doing
among
the
sylphs
the
old
nur
thought
that
king
loc
had
gone
out
of
his
mind
and
he
was
not
very
frightened
because
he
was
certain
that
king
loc
if
he
became
mad
would
certainly
turn
into
a
graceful
witty
amiable
and
kindly
madman
the
madness
of
the
dwarfs
is
gentle
like
their
sanity
and
delightfully
fantastic
but
king
loc
was
not
mad
at
least
he
was
not
more
so
than
lovers
usually
are
i
mean
george
of
the
white
moor
he
said
to
the
old
man
who
had
forgotten
this
young
man
as
completely
as
possible
then
the
learned
nur
arranged
the
lenses
and
the
mirrors
in
a
careful
pattern
but
so
intricate
that
it
had
the
appearance
of
disorder
and
showed
to
king
loc
in
the
mirror
the
very
shape
of
george
of
the
white
moor
such
as
he
was
when
the
sylphs
carried
him
off
by
properly
choosing
and
skilfully
directing
the
instruments
the
dwarf
showed
the
lovelorn
king
the
whole
adventure
of
the
son
of
that
countess
who
was
warned
of
her
end
by
a
white
rose
and
here
expressed
in
words
is
what
the
two
little
men
saw
in
the
reality
of
form
and
colour
when
george
was
carried
away
in
the
icy
arms
of
the
daughter
of
the
lake
he
felt
the
water
press
his
eyes
and
his
breast
and
he
thought
it
was
death
yet
he
heard
songs
that
were
like
caresses
and
he
was
steeped
in
a
delicious
coolness
when
he
opened
his
eyes
again
he
found
himself
in
a
grotto
it
had
crystal
pillars
in
which
the
delicate
tints
of
the
rainbow
shone
at
the
end
of
this
grotto
there
was
a
large
shell
of
irisated
with
the
softest
colours
it
was
a
canopy
spreading
over
a
throne
of
coral
and
weeds
where
sat
the
queen
of
the
sylphs
but
the
aspect
of
the
sovereign
of
the
waters
had
lights
softer
than
the
sheen
of
and
of
crystal
she
smiled
at
the
child
brought
to
her
by
her
women
and
let
her
green
eyes
rest
on
him
long
friend
she
at
length
said
to
him
welcome
in
our
world
where
you
will
be
spared
every
pain
for
you
no
dry
books
or
rough
exercises
nothing
coarse
that
recalls
the
earth
and
its
labours
but
only
the
songs
the
dances
and
the
friendship
of
the
sylphs
so
the
women
taught
the
child
music
waltzing
and
a
thousand
amusements
they
loved
to
bind
on
his
forehead
the
shells
that
starred
their
own
locks
but
he
thinking
of
his
country
gnawed
his
fists
in
impatience
the
years
went
by
and
george
s
wish
to
see
the
earth
again
was
unchanged
and
fervent
the
hardy
earth
burnt
by
the
sun
frozen
by
the
snow
the
native
earth
of
sufferings
and
affections
the
earth
where
he
had
seen
where
he
wished
to
see
bee
again
now
he
was
growing
into
a
big
boy
and
a
slight
golden
down
ran
along
his
upper
lip
boldness
came
to
him
with
his
beard
and
one
day
he
appeared
before
the
queen
of
the
sylphs
and
having
bowed
said
to
her
my
lady
i
have
come
if
you
deign
to
permit
it
to
take
leave
of
you
i
am
going
back
to
the
clarides
dear
friend
the
queen
answered
smiling
i
can
not
grant
you
the
leave
you
demand
for
i
keep
you
in
my
crystal
manor
to
make
you
my
friend
my
lady
george
replied
i
feel
unworthy
of
so
great
an
honour
this
is
the
effect
of
your
courtesy
no
good
knight
ever
thinks
he
has
done
enough
to
win
the
love
of
his
lady
further
you
are
yet
too
young
to
know
all
your
merits
be
sure
dear
friend
that
nobody
wishes
you
anything
but
good
you
only
have
to
obey
your
lady
my
lady
i
love
bee
of
the
clarides
and
i
will
love
no
other
lady
but
her
the
queen
very
pale
but
still
more
beautiful
cried
a
mortal
woman
a
gross
daughter
of
men
this
bee
how
can
you
love
that
i
do
not
know
but
i
know
that
i
love
her
very
well
you
will
recover
and
she
detained
the
young
man
in
the
delights
of
the
crystal
manor
he
did
not
know
what
a
woman
was
and
was
more
like
achilles
among
the
daughters
of
lycomedes
than
tannhauser
in
the
magic
mountain
so
he
wandered
gloomily
along
the
walls
of
the
immense
palace
looking
for
an
opening
to
run
away
but
on
all
sides
he
saw
the
floods
enclosing
his
luminous
prison
in
their
mute
and
magnificent
kingdom
through
the
transparent
walls
he
watched
the
anemones
bloom
and
the
coral
flowering
while
purple
azure
and
golden
fish
sparkled
and
sported
above
the
delicate
madrepores
and
the
glistening
shells
these
marvels
did
not
interest
him
but
lulled
by
the
delicious
songs
of
the
sylphs
he
slowly
felt
his
will
give
way
and
his
whole
soul
dissolve
he
was
all
slackness
and
indifference
when
he
found
by
chance
in
a
gallery
of
the
palace
an
old
worn
book
of
vellum
studded
with
copper
nails
the
book
found
in
a
wreck
at
the
bottom
of
the
sea
dealt
with
chivalry
and
ladies
and
there
were
told
at
length
stories
of
the
adventures
of
heroes
who
went
through
the
world
fighting
giants
redressing
wrongs
protecting
widows
and
assisting
orphans
for
the
love
of
justice
and
the
honour
of
beauty
george
flushed
and
grew
pale
in
turn
with
admiration
shame
and
anger
at
the
tale
of
these
splendid
adventures
he
could
not
contain
himself
i
also
he
cried
will
be
a
good
knight
i
also
will
go
through
the
world
punishing
the
wicked
and
helping
the
unhappy
for
the
good
of
men
and
the
name
of
my
lady
bee
then
his
heart
grew
great
with
courage
he
strode
with
drawn
sword
through
the
crystal
mansions
the
white
women
fled
and
vanished
before
him
like
the
silvery
waves
of
a
lake
their
queen
alone
saw
him
come
upon
her
unmoved
she
fixed
on
him
the
cold
look
of
her
green
eyes
he
rushes
to
her
he
cries
unclasp
the
charm
which
you
have
thrown
on
me
open
me
the
road
to
earth
i
wish
to
fight
in
the
sun
like
a
knight
i
wish
to
return
to
love
to
suffer
and
to
struggle
give
me
back
the
true
life
and
the
true
light
give
me
action
and
achievement
if
you
do
not
i
will
kill
you
wicked
woman
she
shook
her
head
smiling
to
say
no
she
was
beautiful
and
calm
george
struck
her
with
all
his
strength
but
his
sword
broke
against
the
glittering
bosom
of
the
queen
of
the
sylphs
child
she
said
and
she
had
him
shut
up
in
a
kind
of
crystal
funnel
which
formed
a
cell
under
the
manor
round
it
sharks
prowled
opening
their
monstrous
jaws
armed
with
a
triple
row
of
sharp
teeth
and
it
seemed
as
if
at
each
charge
they
must
break
the
thin
partition
of
glass
it
was
not
possible
to
sleep
in
this
strange
cell
the
point
of
this
submarine
funnel
rested
on
a
rocky
bottom
which
was
the
dome
of
the
furthest
and
the
least
known
cavern
of
the
empire
of
the
dwarfs
this
is
what
the
two
little
men
saw
in
the
course
of
an
hour
as
exactly
as
if
they
had
followed
george
all
the
days
of
his
life
the
ancient
nur
after
having
displayed
the
cell
scene
in
all
its
sadness
spoke
to
king
loc
much
in
the
way
of
a
showman
when
he
has
shown
the
magic
lantern
to
little
children
king
loc
he
said
to
him
i
have
shown
you
all
you
wished
to
see
and
your
knowledge
being
perfect
i
can
add
nothing
to
it
i
am
not
anxious
to
know
whether
what
you
have
seen
has
pleased
you
it
is
enough
that
it
is
true
science
takes
no
account
of
pleasing
or
displeasing
it
is
inhuman
it
is
not
science
it
is
poetry
which
charms
and
consoles
that
is
why
poetry
is
more
necessary
than
science
king
loc
go
and
compose
a
song
king
loc
went
out
of
the
well
without
speaking
a
word
which
king
loc
makes
a
terrible
on
leaving
the
well
of
science
king
loc
went
to
his
treasure
took
a
ring
from
a
box
of
which
he
alone
had
a
key
and
put
it
on
his
finger
the
bezel
of
this
ring
shone
brightly
for
it
was
made
of
magic
stone
whose
virtues
will
be
discovered
in
the
course
of
this
story
king
loc
then
went
to
his
palace
where
he
put
on
a
travelling
cloak
drew
on
heavy
boots
and
took
a
stick
then
he
set
out
through
the
crowded
street
the
broad
roads
the
villages
and
the
halls
of
porphyry
the
lakes
of
petroleum
and
the
grottos
of
crystal
which
communicated
with
each
other
by
narrow
openings
he
seemed
pensive
and
spoke
words
which
had
no
sense
but
he
walked
on
steadily
mountains
blocked
the
way
and
he
climbed
the
mountains
cliffs
yawned
at
his
feet
and
he
went
down
the
cliffs
he
crossed
fords
he
passed
through
grisly
regions
darkened
by
the
fumes
of
sulphur
he
walked
over
burning
lava
in
which
his
feet
printed
themselves
he
seemed
to
be
an
extremely
determined
traveller
he
entered
dark
caverns
where
the
sea
water
trickling
in
drops
fell
like
tears
along
the
weeds
and
made
pools
in
the
uneven
soil
in
which
innumerable
crustaceans
grew
monstrously
enormous
crabs
giant
crayfish
spiders
of
the
sea
cracked
under
the
feet
of
the
dwarf
and
made
off
leaving
behind
a
claw
and
waking
in
their
flight
hideous
hoary
who
suddenly
waved
their
hundred
arms
and
spat
from
their
beaks
a
reeking
poison
king
loc
went
on
all
the
same
he
reached
the
end
of
these
caverns
staggering
under
a
load
of
monsters
armed
with
stings
double
jagged
pincers
claws
that
curled
up
to
his
neck
and
sullen
eyes
brandished
at
the
end
of
long
branches
he
climbed
the
side
of
the
cavern
clinging
to
the
roughnesses
of
the
rock
and
the
armoured
beasts
went
up
with
him
and
he
only
stopped
when
by
groping
he
found
a
stone
that
jutted
out
of
the
vaulted
summit
with
his
magic
ring
he
touched
this
stone
which
immediately
fell
with
a
great
crash
and
immediately
a
flood
of
light
poured
its
lovely
streams
into
the
cavern
and
put
to
flight
the
beasts
bred
in
darkness
king
loc
put
his
head
through
the
opening
where
the
light
came
from
saw
george
of
the
white
moor
thinking
of
bee
and
the
earth
and
mourning
in
his
glass
prison
for
king
loc
had
made
this
subterranean
journey
to
release
the
prisoner
of
the
sylphs
but
seeing
this
big
head
all
hair
eyebrows
and
beard
look
at
him
from
the
bottom
of
the
crystal
funnel
george
thought
a
great
danger
threatened
him
and
he
felt
for
the
sword
at
his
side
forgetting
he
had
broken
it
on
the
bosom
of
the
woman
meanwhile
king
loc
examined
him
curiously
pooh
he
said
to
himself
it
is
only
a
child
certainly
it
was
a
very
simple
child
and
he
owed
to
his
great
simplicity
his
escape
from
the
delicious
and
mortal
kisses
of
the
queen
of
the
sylphs
aristotle
with
all
his
learning
could
not
have
got
out
of
it
so
easily
george
seeing
himself
defenceless
said
what
do
you
want
of
me
big
head
why
hurt
me
if
i
have
never
hurt
you
king
loc
answered
in
a
jovial
and
gruff
tone
my
dear
boy
you
do
not
know
if
you
have
hurt
me
for
you
are
ignorant
of
effect
and
cause
of
reflex
action
and
generally
of
all
philosophy
but
do
not
let
us
talk
of
this
if
you
are
not
reluctant
to
leave
your
funnel
come
through
here
george
immediately
insinuated
himself
into
the
cavern
slid
down
the
wall
and
as
soon
as
he
reached
the
bottom
you
are
a
good
little
man
he
said
to
his
deliverer
i
will
like
you
all
my
life
but
do
you
know
where
bee
of
the
clarides
is
i
know
a
great
many
things
answered
the
dwarf
and
especially
that
i
do
not
like
inquisitive
people
george
hearing
these
words
remained
quite
abashed
and
he
silently
followed
his
guide
through
the
thick
and
murky
air
where
cuttlefish
and
crabs
were
moving
then
king
loc
said
to
him
with
a
grin
the
road
is
rather
rough
my
young
prince
sir
george
answered
him
the
way
to
freedom
is
always
pleasant
and
i
am
not
afraid
of
being
lost
by
following
my
benefactor
little
king
loc
bit
his
lips
when
he
reached
the
hall
of
porphyry
he
showed
the
young
man
a
staircase
made
in
the
stone
by
which
the
dwarfs
go
up
above
ground
here
is
your
road
he
said
to
him
do
not
say
replied
george
tell
me
you
will
see
me
again
my
life
belongs
to
you
after
what
you
have
done
for
me
king
loc
answered
what
i
have
done
was
not
for
you
but
for
another
we
had
better
not
see
each
other
again
because
we
might
not
like
each
other
george
replied
unaffectedly
and
seriously
i
did
not
think
that
my
release
would
give
me
pain
and
yet
it
has
sir
i
wish
you
a
good
journey
king
loc
cried
roughly
now
this
staircase
ended
in
a
lonely
quarry
which
lay
less
than
a
league
from
the
castle
of
the
clarides
king
loc
pursued
his
way
muttering
this
boy
has
neither
the
learning
nor
the
wealth
of
the
dwarfs
i
do
not
really
know
why
he
is
loved
by
bee
unless
it
is
that
he
is
young
handsome
loyal
and
bold
he
returned
to
the
town
laughing
to
himself
like
a
man
who
has
played
a
practical
joke
on
some
one
passing
in
front
of
bee
s
house
he
pushed
his
big
head
through
the
window
as
he
had
done
into
the
glass
funnel
and
he
saw
the
young
girl
embroidering
a
veil
with
silver
flowers
rejoice
bee
he
said
to
her
and
you
she
answered
little
king
loc
may
you
never
have
anything
to
wish
for
or
at
least
anything
to
regret
there
was
something
he
wished
for
but
really
he
had
nothing
to
regret
this
thought
gave
him
a
large
appetite
for
supper
after
eating
a
great
number
of
truffled
pheasants
he
called
bob
bob
he
said
to
him
get
on
your
crow
go
to
the
princess
of
the
dwarfs
and
tell
her
that
george
of
the
white
moor
who
was
for
a
long
time
a
prisoner
of
the
sylphs
returned
to
the
clarides
he
spoke
and
bob
flew
off
on
his
crow
the
marvellous
meeting
that
occurred
to
john
the
master
tailor
and
of
the
good
song
sung
by
the
birds
of
the
grove
to
the
when
george
found
himself
on
the
earth
where
he
was
born
the
first
person
he
met
was
john
the
old
master
tailor
carrying
on
his
arm
a
scarlet
suit
for
the
steward
of
the
castle
the
old
fellow
gave
a
great
cry
at
the
sight
of
the
young
lord
st
james
he
said
if
it
is
not
his
highness
george
of
the
white
moor
who
was
drowned
in
the
lake
seven
years
ago
then
it
is
his
ghost
or
the
devil
himself
it
is
not
a
ghost
or
a
devil
my
good
john
but
it
is
that
george
of
the
white
moor
who
used
to
slip
into
your
shop
and
ask
you
for
little
bits
of
cloth
to
make
dresses
for
the
dolls
of
my
sister
bee
but
the
old
fellow
exclaimed
so
you
were
not
drowned
your
highness
i
am
very
pleased
you
look
quite
well
my
grandson
peter
who
used
to
climb
up
into
my
arms
of
a
sunday
morning
to
see
you
go
by
on
horseback
next
to
the
duchess
has
become
a
good
workman
and
a
fine
handsome
lad
he
will
be
glad
to
know
you
are
not
at
the
bottom
of
the
water
and
that
the
fish
have
not
eaten
you
as
he
thought
he
is
accustomed
to
say
about
this
the
most
amusing
things
in
the
world
for
he
is
full
of
wit
your
highness
and
it
is
a
fact
that
everybody
regrets
you
in
the
clarides
you
were
such
a
promising
little
boy
i
will
remember
to
my
last
day
how
once
you
asked
me
for
my
needle
and
as
i
would
not
give
it
to
you
because
you
were
not
old
enough
to
handle
it
without
danger
you
answered
me
that
you
would
go
into
the
wood
and
pick
the
fine
needles
of
the
pines
this
is
what
you
said
and
it
still
makes
me
laugh
upon
my
word
this
is
what
you
said
our
little
peter
used
also
to
make
excellent
answers
he
is
a
cooper
at
present
at
your
service
your
highness
i
will
employ
none
other
but
him
but
master
john
give
me
some
news
of
bee
and
the
duchess
alas
where
have
you
been
your
highness
not
to
know
that
princess
bee
was
carried
off
seven
years
ago
by
the
dwarfs
of
the
mountain
she
disappeared
the
very
day
you
were
drowned
and
it
can
be
said
that
on
that
day
the
clarides
lost
their
two
sweetest
flowers
the
duchess
has
mourned
greatly
ever
since
this
always
makes
me
say
that
the
great
people
of
this
world
have
their
trouble
like
the
poorest
workmen
and
this
is
a
sign
that
we
are
all
children
of
adam
accordingly
a
cat
may
look
at
a
king
as
they
say
by
the
same
token
the
good
duchess
saw
her
hair
grow
grey
and
lost
all
her
gaiety
and
when
in
the
spring
she
walks
about
in
a
black
dress
under
the
grove
where
the
birds
sing
the
smallest
of
these
birds
is
more
enviable
than
the
sovereign
of
the
clarides
her
sorrow
however
is
not
hopeless
your
highness
for
if
she
has
no
news
of
you
at
least
she
knows
by
dreams
that
her
daughter
bee
is
alive
old
john
said
these
things
and
many
others
too
but
george
was
not
listening
to
him
since
he
had
heard
that
bee
was
a
prisoner
of
the
dwarfs
he
reflected
the
dwarfs
detain
bee
under
the
earth
a
dwarf
got
me
out
of
my
crystal
prison
these
little
men
have
not
all
the
same
habits
my
deliverer
surely
does
not
belong
to
the
tribe
of
those
who
carried
off
my
sister
he
did
not
know
what
to
think
unless
it
was
that
bee
must
be
released
now
they
were
going
through
the
town
and
as
they
passed
the
old
women
standing
at
their
thresholds
asked
each
other
who
this
young
stranger
was
and
they
agreed
his
appearance
was
handsome
the
more
wary
having
recognised
the
lord
of
the
white
moor
thought
they
saw
a
ghost
and
fled
crossing
themselves
vigorously
holy
water
ought
to
be
cast
at
him
said
an
old
woman
and
he
would
vanish
leaving
a
disgusting
smell
of
sulphur
he
is
carrying
off
master
john
the
tailor
and
quite
certainly
he
will
plunge
him
all
alive
into
the
flames
of
hell
gently
old
woman
a
burgess
replied
the
young
lord
is
alive
and
a
good
deal
more
so
than
you
and
me
he
is
as
fresh
as
a
rose
and
rather
seems
to
have
come
from
some
noble
court
than
from
the
other
world
men
come
back
from
far
my
good
woman
witness
the
squire
freeheart
who
came
back
to
us
from
rome
last
candlemas
and
mary
the
armourer
s
daughter
having
admired
george
went
up
to
her
maiden
room
and
kneeling
then
before
the
image
of
the
holy
virgin
holy
virgin
she
said
grant
me
a
husband
like
this
young
lord
every
one
spoke
in
their
own
way
of
the
return
of
george
so
much
so
that
the
news
flew
from
mouth
to
mouth
to
the
ears
of
the
duchess
who
was
then
walking
in
the
orchard
her
heart
beat
high
and
she
heard
all
the
birds
in
the
grove
sing
teewhit
teewhit
teewhit
teewhit
teewhit
teewhit
george
of
the
white
moor
teewhit
teewhit
teewhit
whom
you
brought
up
teewhit
teewhit
teewhit
is
here
here
here
here
freeheart
respectfully
approached
her
and
said
to
her
your
grace
george
of
the
white
moor
whom
you
thought
to
be
dead
has
returned
i
am
going
to
make
a
song
about
it
still
the
birds
sang
teewhit
teewhit
twit
twit
is
here
here
here
is
here
here
here
and
when
she
saw
the
child
coming
she
had
brought
up
as
a
son
she
opened
her
arms
and
fell
in
a
swoon
of
a
little
satin
people
were
pretty
certain
in
the
clarides
that
bee
had
been
carried
off
by
the
dwarfs
it
was
also
the
belief
of
the
duchess
but
her
dreams
did
not
give
her
any
exact
information
we
will
find
her
said
george
we
will
find
her
answered
freeheart
and
we
will
bring
her
back
to
her
mother
said
george
and
we
will
bring
her
back
answered
freeheart
and
we
will
marry
her
said
george
and
we
will
marry
her
answered
freeheart
and
they
inquired
among
the
inhabitants
concerning
the
habits
of
the
dwarfs
and
the
mysterious
facts
of
bee
s
capture
this
led
them
to
question
the
nurse
glauce
who
had
been
the
nurse
of
the
duchess
of
the
clarides
but
now
glauce
was
old
and
fed
the
fowls
in
her
farmyard
there
the
squire
and
his
master
found
her
she
was
crying
ss
ss
ss
chick
chick
chick
ss
ss
ss
ss
and
throwing
grain
to
the
chicks
ss
ss
ss
chick
chick
chick
it
is
your
highness
ss
ss
ss
is
it
possible
that
you
have
become
so
big
ss
and
so
handsome
ss
ss
shoo
shoo
shoo
do
you
see
that
big
one
there
eating
the
share
of
the
small
ones
shoo
shoo
so
it
is
everywhere
in
the
world
your
highness
all
the
good
goes
to
the
rich
the
lean
get
leaner
while
the
fat
get
fatter
for
there
is
no
justice
on
this
earth
what
can
i
do
for
you
your
highness
you
will
surely
each
of
you
take
a
glass
of
ale
we
will
take
one
with
pleasure
glauce
and
i
will
kiss
you
because
you
nursed
the
mother
of
her
whom
i
love
best
in
the
world
it
is
quite
true
your
highness
my
baby
had
its
first
tooth
in
six
months
and
fourteen
days
and
on
that
occasion
the
late
duchess
made
me
a
present
it
is
quite
true
well
tell
us
glauce
what
you
know
of
the
dwarfs
who
carried
off
bee
alas
your
highness
i
know
nothing
of
the
dwarfs
who
carried
her
off
and
how
can
an
old
woman
like
me
know
anything
i
forgot
the
little
i
ever
learnt
long
ago
and
i
have
not
even
enough
memory
to
remember
where
i
put
my
spectacles
i
often
look
for
them
when
i
have
them
on
try
this
ale
it
is
nice
and
cool
your
health
glauce
but
i
am
told
your
husband
knew
something
about
bee
s
carrying
off
it
is
quite
true
your
highness
though
he
had
never
got
any
education
he
knew
a
great
many
things
that
he
learnt
in
inns
and
taverns
he
never
forgot
anything
if
he
was
still
in
this
world
and
sitting
at
this
table
with
us
he
could
tell
you
stories
by
the
week
he
told
me
so
many
and
so
many
of
all
kinds
that
they
have
made
a
muddle
inside
my
head
and
i
can
not
at
this
moment
make
head
or
tail
of
any
of
them
it
is
quite
true
your
highness
yes
it
is
quite
true
and
the
head
of
the
old
nurse
was
as
useless
as
an
old
cracked
kettle
george
and
freeheart
had
all
the
trouble
in
the
world
to
get
any
good
out
of
her
at
last
by
sifting
her
they
drew
out
a
story
which
began
in
this
style
seven
years
ago
your
highness
on
the
very
day
you
and
bee
got
into
the
scrape
from
which
neither
of
you
came
back
my
late
husband
went
into
the
hills
to
sell
a
horse
it
is
quite
true
he
gave
his
beast
a
good
feed
of
oats
with
a
dash
of
cider
in
it
so
that
it
might
have
a
firm
leg
and
a
bright
eye
he
took
it
to
the
market
near
the
hills
his
corn
and
his
cider
were
not
lost
for
it
made
his
horse
sell
better
it
is
the
same
with
beasts
as
with
men
they
are
judged
by
appearances
my
late
husband
was
pleased
at
the
good
business
he
had
done
he
offered
to
drink
with
his
friends
undertaking
to
drink
fair
to
them
and
i
must
tell
you
your
highness
that
there
was
not
a
man
in
the
whole
clarides
who
could
drink
fairer
with
his
friends
than
my
husband
so
much
so
that
on
this
day
after
a
great
deal
of
good
feeling
and
harmony
he
came
back
alone
in
the
twilight
and
took
a
wrong
road
for
want
of
finding
the
right
one
finding
himself
near
a
cavern
he
saw
as
clear
as
it
was
possible
in
his
condition
and
at
that
hour
a
band
of
little
men
carrying
a
boy
or
a
girl
on
a
stretcher
he
ran
away
for
fear
of
a
mishap
for
wine
did
not
deprive
him
of
discretion
but
at
some
distance
from
the
cavern
having
let
his
pipe
fall
he
bent
to
pick
it
up
and
took
hold
of
a
little
satin
slipper
instead
he
made
a
remark
about
it
which
he
liked
to
repeat
when
he
was
in
a
good
temper
this
is
the
first
time
he
said
to
himself
that
a
pipe
changes
into
a
now
as
this
slipper
was
the
slipper
of
a
little
girl
he
thought
that
she
who
had
lost
it
in
the
wood
had
been
carried
off
by
the
dwarfs
and
that
it
was
her
capture
he
had
seen
he
was
just
on
the
point
of
putting
the
slipper
in
his
pocket
when
little
men
covered
with
hoods
threw
themselves
upon
him
and
gave
him
so
many
smacks
on
the
head
that
he
remained
on
the
spot
quite
dazed
glauce
glauce
cried
george
it
is
bee
s
slipper
give
it
me
that
i
may
kiss
it
a
thousand
times
it
shall
lie
on
my
heart
for
ever
in
a
bag
of
scented
silk
and
when
i
die
it
shall
be
put
in
my
coffin
as
you
please
your
highness
but
where
will
you
go
to
get
it
the
dwarfs
took
it
back
from
my
poor
husband
and
he
even
thought
that
why
he
had
been
so
thoroughly
beaten
was
because
he
tried
to
put
it
in
his
pocket
to
show
the
magistrates
he
was
accustomed
to
say
on
the
subject
when
he
was
in
a
good
temper
enough
enough
only
tell
me
the
name
of
the
cave
my
lord
it
is
called
the
cave
of
the
dwarfs
and
it
is
well
called
so
my
late
husband
glauce
not
a
word
more
but
you
freeheart
do
you
know
where
this
cave
is
my
lord
answered
freeheart
finishing
his
mug
of
ale
you
would
be
quite
certain
i
do
if
you
knew
my
songs
better
i
have
composed
at
least
a
dozen
on
this
cave
and
i
have
described
it
without
forgetting
the
smallest
sprig
of
moss
i
venture
to
say
my
lord
that
of
these
twelve
songs
six
are
really
worth
something
but
the
six
others
are
not
to
be
disdained
i
will
just
sing
you
one
or
two
freeheart
cried
george
we
will
seize
the
cave
of
the
dwarfs
and
we
will
deliver
bee
nothing
could
be
more
certain
answered
freeheart
which
a
dangerous
adventure
is
as
soon
as
night
came
and
the
whole
castle
was
asleep
george
and
freeheart
slipped
into
the
low
hall
to
get
arms
there
under
the
smoky
joists
gleamed
lances
swords
dirks
espadons
hunting
knives
daggers
all
that
is
required
to
kill
man
and
wolf
under
each
rafter
a
complete
suit
of
armour
stood
upright
holding
itself
so
sternly
and
proudly
that
it
seemed
as
if
it
was
still
filled
by
the
soul
of
the
brave
man
who
had
arrayed
himself
in
it
in
bygone
days
to
go
on
great
adventures
and
the
glove
clasped
the
lance
in
ten
iron
fingers
while
the
shield
rested
on
the
tassets
of
the
thigh
as
if
to
teach
that
prudence
is
necessary
to
courage
and
that
the
good
soldier
is
armed
for
defence
as
well
as
for
attack
george
selected
amid
so
ample
a
choice
the
suit
of
armour
which
the
father
of
bee
had
carried
as
far
as
the
isles
of
avalon
and
of
thule
he
put
it
on
with
the
help
of
freeheart
and
he
did
not
forget
the
shield
on
which
was
blazoned
proper
the
golden
sun
of
the
clarides
freeheart
on
the
other
hand
arrayed
himself
in
the
good
old
steel
coat
of
his
grandfather
and
crowned
himself
with
an
obsolete
headpiece
to
which
he
added
a
kind
of
and
ragged
plume
feather
or
brush
he
made
this
choice
for
fun
and
to
look
comical
for
he
considered
that
gaiety
good
at
all
hours
is
especially
useful
when
there
are
great
dangers
to
be
incurred
having
thus
armed
themselves
they
went
off
under
the
moon
over
the
dark
fields
freeheart
had
tied
the
horses
at
the
edge
of
a
little
wood
near
the
fortress
gate
where
they
found
them
gnawing
the
bark
of
the
bushes
these
horses
were
very
swift
and
it
took
them
less
than
an
hour
to
reach
amid
dancing
will
o
wisps
and
confused
visions
the
mountains
of
the
dwarfs
here
is
the
cave
said
freeheart
the
lord
and
squire
dismounted
sword
in
hand
they
entered
the
cave
great
courage
was
required
to
engage
in
such
an
adventure
but
george
was
in
love
and
freeheart
was
faithful
and
as
the
most
delightful
of
poets
says
what
can
not
friendship
do
guided
by
sweet
love
the
lord
and
the
squire
walked
in
the
darkness
for
nearly
an
hour
then
they
saw
a
great
blaze
at
which
they
were
astonished
it
was
one
of
those
meteors
with
which
we
know
the
dwarfs
illuminate
their
kingdom
by
the
light
of
this
subterranean
brightness
they
saw
they
were
at
the
base
of
an
ancient
castle
here
said
george
is
the
castle
which
we
must
seize
certainly
answered
freeheart
but
allow
me
to
drink
a
few
drops
of
this
wine
which
i
brought
with
me
as
a
weapon
for
a
good
wine
makes
a
good
man
and
a
good
man
makes
a
good
spear
and
a
good
spear
makes
a
bad
foe
george
not
seeing
a
living
soul
roughly
struck
with
the
hilt
of
his
sword
the
door
of
the
castle
a
small
quavering
voice
made
him
lift
his
head
and
he
saw
at
one
of
the
windows
a
very
small
old
man
with
a
long
beard
who
asked
him
who
are
you
george
of
the
white
moor
and
what
do
you
want
i
want
to
take
back
bee
of
the
clarides
whom
you
unjustly
detain
in
your
ugly
moles
that
you
are
the
dwarf
disappeared
and
again
george
found
himself
alone
with
freeheart
who
said
to
him
my
lord
i
do
not
know
if
i
am
guilty
of
exaggeration
when
i
state
that
in
your
answer
to
the
dwarf
you
did
not
perhaps
exhaust
all
the
resources
of
the
most
persuasive
eloquence
freeheart
feared
nothing
but
he
was
old
his
manners
like
the
top
of
his
head
had
been
smoothed
by
time
and
he
did
not
like
to
see
people
annoyed
george
on
the
other
hand
rushed
about
yelling
vile
earthmen
moles
badgers
dormice
ferrets
and
only
open
the
door
and
i
will
cut
all
your
ears
off
but
hardly
had
he
finished
speaking
these
words
when
the
bronze
door
of
the
castle
opened
of
itself
no
one
could
be
seen
pushing
the
huge
leaves
george
was
frightened
and
yet
he
stepped
through
the
mysterious
door
because
his
courage
was
greater
than
his
fear
once
inside
the
court
he
saw
at
all
the
windows
in
all
the
galleries
on
all
the
roofs
on
all
the
gables
inside
the
lamp
and
even
on
the
dwarfs
armed
with
bows
and
he
heard
the
bronze
door
shut
behind
him
and
a
shower
of
arrows
began
to
fall
hard
on
his
head
and
his
shoulders
for
the
second
time
he
was
very
frightened
and
for
the
second
time
he
overcame
his
fear
shield
on
arm
and
sword
in
hand
he
went
up
the
stairs
when
suddenly
he
saw
standing
on
the
highest
step
and
calmly
majestic
a
stately
dwarf
bearing
the
golden
sceptre
the
royal
crown
and
the
purple
mantle
and
this
dwarf
he
recognised
to
be
the
little
man
who
had
freed
him
from
his
glass
prison
then
he
threw
himself
at
his
feet
and
said
to
him
in
tears
my
benefactor
is
it
you
are
you
one
of
those
who
have
taken
from
me
bee
whom
i
love
i
am
king
loc
answered
the
dwarf
i
have
kept
bee
with
me
to
teach
her
the
secrets
of
the
dwarfs
child
you
have
come
upon
my
kingdom
like
hail
on
a
garden
of
flowers
but
the
dwarfs
less
weak
than
men
do
not
grow
irritated
as
they
do
i
am
too
much
above
you
in
mind
to
feel
anger
at
your
acts
whatever
they
may
be
of
all
the
advantages
i
have
over
you
there
is
one
that
i
will
carefully
keep
it
is
that
of
being
just
i
will
send
for
bee
and
i
will
ask
her
if
she
wishes
to
follow
you
i
will
do
this
not
because
you
demand
it
but
because
it
is
my
duty
there
was
a
deep
silence
and
bee
appeared
in
a
white
dress
with
her
fair
hair
loose
as
soon
as
she
saw
george
she
ran
to
throw
herself
in
his
arms
and
clasped
with
all
her
might
the
iron
breast
of
the
knight
then
king
loc
said
to
her
bee
is
it
true
that
this
is
the
man
whom
you
wish
to
marry
it
is
true
very
true
that
this
is
the
man
little
king
loc
answered
bee
look
little
men
how
i
laugh
and
how
i
am
happy
and
she
began
to
cry
her
tears
fell
on
george
s
cheek
and
they
were
tears
of
happiness
laughter
mingled
with
the
tears
and
a
thousand
delightful
words
which
had
no
sense
like
those
murmured
by
little
children
she
did
not
reflect
that
the
sight
of
her
happiness
could
sadden
the
heart
of
king
loc
dearest
george
said
to
her
i
find
you
again
just
as
i
wished
you
to
be
the
most
beautiful
and
the
best
of
beings
you
love
me
heaven
be
thanked
you
love
me
but
bee
do
you
not
also
love
king
loc
a
little
who
drew
me
from
the
glass
prison
where
the
sylphs
kept
me
far
from
you
bee
turned
to
king
loc
little
king
loc
you
did
this
she
cried
you
loved
me
and
you
freed
the
one
who
loved
me
and
whom
i
loved
she
could
say
no
more
and
she
fell
on
her
knees
her
head
in
her
hands
all
the
little
men
witnesses
of
this
scene
shed
tears
on
their
crossbows
king
loc
alone
kept
an
unmoved
face
bee
discovering
in
him
so
much
magnanimity
and
so
much
kindness
felt
for
him
the
love
of
a
daughter
for
a
father
she
seized
the
hand
of
her
lover
and
said
george
i
love
you
heaven
only
knows
how
much
i
love
you
but
how
can
i
leave
little
king
loc
ha
ha
you
are
both
prisoners
of
mine
cried
king
loc
in
a
terrible
voice
he
put
on
a
terrible
voice
by
way
of
amusement
and
to
play
a
good
joke
but
really
he
was
not
angry
freeheart
came
to
him
and
bent
a
knee
to
the
ground
sir
he
said
will
your
highness
be
pleased
to
let
me
share
the
captivity
of
the
master
i
serve
bee
recognising
him
said
to
him
it
is
you
my
good
freeheart
i
am
pleased
to
see
you
again
you
are
wearing
a
very
ugly
feather
tell
me
have
you
composed
any
new
songs
and
king
loc
took
them
all
three
off
to
dinner
which
all
ends
the
next
day
george
and
freeheart
dressed
themselves
in
sumptuous
clothes
which
the
dwarfs
had
prepared
for
them
and
betook
themselves
to
the
hall
of
state
where
king
loc
in
the
dress
of
an
emperor
soon
came
to
join
them
as
he
had
promised
he
was
followed
by
his
officers
wearing
arms
and
furs
of
a
wild
magnificence
and
helmets
on
which
waved
the
dwarfs
thronging
in
crowds
came
in
by
the
windows
the
ventilators
and
the
chimneys
and
even
crept
under
the
seats
king
loc
got
up
on
a
stone
table
at
the
end
of
which
were
drawn
up
rows
of
flagons
candlesticks
bowls
and
cups
of
fine
gold
and
of
marvellous
workmanship
he
motioned
to
bee
and
to
george
to
come
near
and
said
bee
a
law
of
the
dwarf
people
requires
that
a
stranger
received
within
our
house
should
be
free
at
the
end
of
seven
full
years
you
have
spent
seven
years
in
our
midst
bee
and
i
would
be
a
bad
citizen
and
a
guilty
king
if
i
detained
you
longer
but
before
i
let
you
go
away
i
wish
not
having
been
able
to
marry
you
to
betroth
you
myself
to
the
man
you
have
chosen
i
do
so
with
joy
because
i
love
you
more
than
myself
and
my
pain
if
any
is
left
is
like
a
little
shadow
unnoticed
in
my
happiness
bee
of
the
clarides
princess
of
the
dwarfs
give
me
your
hand
and
you
george
of
the
white
moor
give
me
yours
having
put
the
hand
of
george
in
that
of
bee
king
loc
turned
to
his
people
and
said
in
a
loud
voice
little
men
my
children
you
are
witnesses
that
these
two
here
undertake
mutually
to
marry
each
other
on
earth
let
them
return
there
together
and
together
bring
forth
deeds
of
courage
modesty
and
faithfulness
as
good
gardeners
tend
and
bring
to
flower
roses
carnations
and
peonies
at
these
words
the
dwarfs
shouted
loudly
and
not
knowing
whether
they
ought
to
lament
or
to
rejoice
they
were
distracted
by
contrary
feelings
king
loc
turned
again
to
the
two
betrothed
and
showing
them
the
bowls
the
flagons
all
the
splendid
plate
these
he
said
are
the
presents
of
the
dwarfs
take
them
bee
they
will
recall
your
little
friends
they
are
given
by
them
and
not
by
me
you
will
know
in
a
moment
what
i
mean
to
give
you
there
was
a
long
silence
king
loc
gazed
with
a
lovely
look
of
tenderness
at
bee
whose
beautiful
radiant
head
crowned
with
roses
rested
on
the
shoulder
of
her
betrothed
then
he
spoke
again
in
these
terms
children
it
is
not
enough
to
love
much
you
must
love
well
great
love
is
good
undoubtedly
wise
love
is
better
may
yours
be
as
mild
as
it
is
strong
may
it
want
nothing
not
even
indulgence
and
may
some
pity
be
mingled
with
it
you
are
young
beautiful
and
good
but
you
are
human
and
for
that
very
reason
subject
to
many
miseries
this
is
why
if
some
pity
does
not
form
part
of
the
feelings
you
have
for
each
other
these
feelings
will
not
be
adapted
to
the
circumstances
of
your
common
life
they
will
be
like
holiday
clothes
which
are
no
protection
against
the
wind
and
the
rain
you
only
love
those
securely
whom
you
love
even
in
their
weaknesses
and
meannesses
mercy
forgiveness
consolation
that
is
love
and
all
its
science
king
loc
stopped
overcome
by
sweet
and
powerful
emotions
he
resumed
his
speech
children
be
happy
keep
your
happiness
keep
it
carefully
while
he
spoke
pic
tad
dic
bob
truc
and
paw
clinging
to
bee
s
white
mantle
covered
with
kisses
the
girl
s
naked
arms
and
hands
and
they
begged
her
not
to
leave
them
then
king
loc
drew
from
his
belt
a
ring
the
stone
of
which
flung
showers
of
light
it
was
the
magic
ring
with
which
he
had
opened
the
dungeon
of
the
sylphs
he
slipped
bee
s
finger
through
it
and
said
bee
receive
at
my
hands
this
ring
which
will
allow
you
to
enter
at
all
times
you
and
your
husband
the
kingdom
of
the
dwarfs
you
will
be
received
with
delight
and
helped
in
every
way
on
the
other
hand
teach
the
children
you
will
have
not
to
despise
the
innocent
and
industrious
little
men
who
live
under
the
earth
illustration
dwarf
sidenote
now
that
we
know
all
about
princess
bee
we
may
find
it
pleasant
to
look
backward
and
think
a
little
about
the
story
chapter
by
chapter
to
find
out
whether
it
has
come
to
stay
in
our
minds
some
stories
do
and
others
don
t
we
are
glad
to
forget
some
stories
but
i
do
not
think
that
the
story
of
bee
is
one
of
that
kind
besides
it
is
told
with
such
loving
carefulness
that
for
the
sake
of
the
writer
who
wrote
that
he
might
please
and
inspire
us
we
ought
to
read
it
again
with
a
quiet
mind
undisturbed
by
any
thought
of
what
is
going
to
happen
next
for
now
we
know
all
about
that
it
is
a
story
of
that
wonder
time
so
often
spoken
of
as
long
long
ago
and
its
date
does
not
matter
but
you
will
see
from
the
first
chapter
that
it
belongs
to
the
time
of
the
knights
the
best
of
whom
tried
to
remedy
things
that
were
wrong
and
make
the
world
a
finer
place
in
which
to
live
do
you
like
the
countess
of
the
white
moor
and
why
how
much
older
was
george
than
bee
sidenote
read
over
several
times
the
description
of
the
estates
of
the
duchess
of
clarides
there
are
three
bites
to
cherry
it
is
such
a
good
and
there
are
many
more
in
this
story
for
which
you
ought
to
watch
with
care
the
old
monk
in
the
tower
with
his
birds
and
his
books
is
worth
thinking
about
and
so
are
his
rules
so
also
are
the
rules
of
the
duchess
there
is
a
good
with
two
trees
and
two
children
in
it
i
wonder
if
you
could
sketch
it
sidenote
do
they
teach
falconry
in
your
school
if
not
you
might
at
least
try
to
find
out
something
about
it
for
it
was
a
fascinating
sport
except
of
course
for
the
little
birds
much
better
fun
than
learning
several
styles
of
handwriting
or
getting
grammatical
instruction
with
barbarous
terminology
what
a
lovely
jumble
of
big
words
what
about
that
sentence
affectionate
lessons
are
the
only
good
lessons
and
whatever
is
inebriety
it
must
be
something
very
dreadful
i
fancy
it
is
something
catching
and
can
most
easily
be
caught
at
and
red
lions
and
indian
queens
and
bull
and
bushes
and
suchlike
places
where
they
know
absolutely
nothing
about
synecdoche
or
aposiopesis
either

there
are
some
lovely

learnt

wish
we
could
all
describe

beautifully

horrid
word
princess
bee
gave
of
the
horizon
and
how
differently
she
thought
of
the
bigness
of
the
world
from
george
do
you
think
they
would
find
lobsters
by
fishing
under
the
old
stone
bridge
perhaps
however
this
is
too
severe
a
question
for
a
tale
about
long
long
ago
those
forbidden
sylphs
were
still
in
the
children
s
minds
but
bee
had
less
fear
than
george
or
was
she
daring
george
to
go
which
of
the
two
children
was
the
best
quarreller
sidenote
and
who
is
the
brave
adventurer
there
is
a
pretty
picture
of
which
the
headless
woman
is
the
centre
read
the
description
again
and
again
and
look
at
the
picture
with
closed
eyes
there
is
another
with
bee
in
the
centre
holding
out
her
skirt
for
the
cherries
bee
s
teachers
had
not
taught
her
economics
had
they
it
would
be
hard
to
find
a
more
charming
description
of
a
walk
than
is
contained
in
this
chapter
bee
is
soon
plunged
in
despair
but
george
is
a
little
greatheart
and
soon
has
his
reward
read
slowly
and
more
than
once
the
description
of
the
lake
the
sudden
appearance
of
the
gives
us
another
pretty
picture
what
is
a
demijohn
how
does
bee
tell
us
that
the
day
is
waning
consider
the
words
reeds
like
pliant
swords
and
the
pretty
coloured
at
the
end
of
the
chapter
sidenote
george
still
plays
the
part
of
greatheart
manfully
and
is
ready
for
any
event
having
used
his
observing
powers
on
the
fruits
and
berries
like
a
boy
scout
think
of
that
sharp
picture
against
the
pale
sky
of
evening
a
little
dwarf
riding
on
a
crow
then
of
the
changing
picture
like
a
lovely
scene
in
a
play
as
night
falls
upon
the
lake
see
how
the
sylphs
come
while
the
boy
stands
entranced
did
he
remember
the
words
of
bee
s
mother
as
he
was
carried
through
the
waters
in
halls
of
crystal
and
porphyry
and
what
a
lovely
word
the
last
one
is
sidenote
it
would
be
good
fun
to
try
to
draw
a
dwarf
from
the
description
given
at
the
beginning
of
this
chapter
helped
by
a
glance
at
some
of
the
little
pictures
in
this
book
can
t
you
feel
how
quick
the
dwarfs
were
as
you
say
the
words
incredible
nimbleness
rolling
them
round
your
tongue
i
wonder
what
it
means
to
look
like
an
old
poet
pic
s
last
sentence
at
all
events
is
very
like
poetry
rug
is
very
good
at
argument
and
at
sticking
to
his
own
opinion
tad
is
a
dwarf
of
character
justice
should
prevail
and
not
custom
as
for
pan
he
might
have
been
a
very
sensible
father
mightn
t
he
there
is
a
pretty
picture
when
bee
raises
herself
upon
her
elbow
and
another
one
of
a
different
kind
when
pic
stands
upon
his
dignity
to
make
himself
taller
and
speaks
the
sounding
sentence
which
begins
she
is
only
a
child
and
what
a
depth
of
real
truth
there
is
in
tad
s
words
you
will
consider
us
less
ugly
when
you
like
us
better
no
one
who
is
loved
can
be
ugly
to
the
one
who
loves
and
what
a
sad
reproach
there
is
in
tad
s
words
to
rug
you
are
more
like
a
man
than
a
dwarf
this
chapter
ends
with
another
charming
picture
sidenote
how
many
colours
or
tints
are
mentioned
in
the
first
paragraph
of
this
chapter
in
the
next
paragraph
poetry
and
gentle
fun
have
kissed
each
other
a
dwarf
of
great
majesty
oh
yes
majesty
is
not
a
matter
of
inches
the
monarch
understood
little
girls
in
a
wonderful
way
and
bee
was
soon
at
her
ease
as
every
guest
is
who
asks
for
a
pair
of
slippers
right
off
the
next
thing
such
a
guest
would
do
would
be
to
poke
the
fire
the
illustrious
belisarius
he
was
a
famous
general
who
won
many
victories
in
italy
and
the
east
and
was
brave
generous
just
and
faithful
and
afraid
of
nothing
but
his
wife
bee
was
just
a
little
ungracious
about
those
slippers
don
t
you
think
but
there
was
some
excuse
for
her
she
want
to
be
at
home
again
it
would
be
a
lovely
arrangement
if
those
who
love
each
other
exchange
dreams
when
they
are
parted
for
a
time
some
people
say
they
do
and
possibly
the
dwarf
poet
believed
it
to
be
possible
sidenote
it
was
a
strange
but
beautiful
underground
world
in
which
the
dwarfs
had
their
home
why
pavement
bee
s
lessons
must
have
been
fascinating
if
only
we
could
all
learn
without
books
then
perhaps
we
also
should
move
with
grace
and
express
ourselves
according
to
the
rule
of
poetry
what
a
delightful
picture
of
a
puppet
show
is
given
in
this
chapter
there
are
clever
men
and
women
who
can
make
dolls
act
in
this
way
read
the
description
again
for
it
is
well
worth
while
wouldn
t
you
like
to
play
the
theorbo
it
has
a
lovely
name
did
the
dwarfs
change
as
the
days
and
months
passed
and
the
years
made
their
round
sidenote
xi
and
the
deep
deep
darkness
between
the
rocky
walls
makes
the
light
shine
all
the
brighter
and
bee
s
exclamation
might
be
that
of
a
blind
girl
whose
sight
is
suddenly
restored
have
you
ever
seen
a
chalice
a
pyx
or
a
patin
and
would
you
know
them
if
you
saw
them
again
or
a
thurible
and
wouldn
t
you
like
that
set
of
moonstone
chessmen
what
a
wonderful
description
of
a
coffer
full
of
jewels
yet
with
all
this
wealth
before
her
bee
chooses
to
go
back
to
earth
and
into
the
sunshine
back
to
her
mother
and
george
of
the
white
moor
more
precious
than
pearls
read
again
and
again
nay
learn
by
heart
what
king
loc
said
to
bee
after
he
had
tested
her
for
he
was
only
testing
her
all
the
time
was
there
ever
such
a
proposal
of
marriage
but
little
king
loc
has
his
own
dignity
also
his
hopes
sidenote
who
would
be
a
princess
and
wear
a
crown
which
interfered
with
flowing
locks
and
merry
gambols
the
strikes
a
sad
note
bee
and
the
little
king
are
both
unhappy
and
there
is
a
pathetic
and
very
beautiful
picture
of
the
princess
gazing
on
the
sunbeam
another
of
her
arrival
on
earth
again
the
king
s
instructions
are
difficult
and
there
is
danger
in
them
the
journey
home
is
fascinating
reminding
us
of
peter
and
wendy
on
the
way
to
the
land
of
lost
boys
so
also
is
the
arrival
home
which
is
fully
described
but
the
sad
ending
is
told
in
a
few
curt
words
it
is
much
too
pitiful
for
a
long
description
sidenote
is
this
story
beginning
to
remind
you
of
an
old
old
tale
told
long
ago
among
the
ancient
greeks
a
tale
of
a
lost
princess
carried
off
to
the
underworld
by
pluto
and
mourned
on
earth
by
ceres
the
goddess
of
the
corn
if
you
happen
to
know
that
old
old
story
you
will
be
able
to
make
interesting
comparisons
but
to
return
to
king
loc
the
secret
comes
out
did
bee
know
that
she
loved
george
of
the
white
moor
when
king
loc
had
asked
her
long
before
whether
she
loved
anyone
else
have
known
bee
s
secret
all
along
the
effect
of
her
declaration
is
rather
piteous
with
a
smile
behind
the
sadness
king
loc
s
exit
is
very
dignified
and
dramatic
and
by
the
way
what
an
excellent
play
could
be
made
from
this
story
or
a
series
of
tableaux
sidenote
poor
king
loc
can
not
understand
the
situation
he
is
a
king
he
has
learning
wealth
and
merit
why
therefore
does
not
bee
love
him
further
he
is
good
and
wishes
to
be
just
poor
little
king
loc
nur
introduces
and
describes
himself
in
a
speech
worth
learning
and
remembering
his
long
speech
about
ourselves
is
full
of
wisdom
and
warning
read
it
again
and
again
the
last
portion
is
very
beautiful
and
what
a
wonderful
way
the
dwarfs
had
of
finding
things
out
without
books
george
of
the
moor
was
easily
traced
king
loc
is
very
undwarflike
or
let
us
say
very
human
when
he
learns
where
george
is
but
would
the
laugh
of
these
little
creatures
even
in
unison
be
a
jovial
great
guffaw
surely
it
is
only
jolly
giants
who
make
great
guffaws
perhaps
you
can
describe
the
dwarf
laughter
in
a
better
way
what
do
you
think
the
writer
means
by
making
nur
live
in
a
deep
well
sidenote
there
is
an
interesting
glimpse
of
one
of
the
duties
of
the
dwarfs
in
the
first
paragraph
of
this
chapter
have
you
read
ewing
s
if
not
get
it
from
the
library
and
read
about
what
one
of
our
poets
calls
the
dwarf
madness
seems
to
be
an
amiable
thing
a
shell
of
remember
that
iris
was
the
greek
goddess
of
the
rainbow
george
was
no
more
happy
among
the
beauties
of
the
than
was
bee
among
the
treasures
of
the
caves
and
he
learnt
the
same
lesson
as
she
did
you
will
find
it
in
the
sentence
which
begins
the
years
went
by
compare
king
loc
with
the
princess
of
the
sylphs
achilles

the
greek
hero
who
fought
against
troy

their
champion

to
prevent

hero
of
the
german
story
who
visited
the
court
of
venus
the
goddess
of
love
and
there
forgot
everything
but
pleasure
but
later
he
repented
the
story
is
set
to
music
in
wagner
s
opera
george
was
not
the
first
nor
the
last
to
be
saved
from
slackness
and
inspired
to
deeds
of
courage
by
a
book
compare
his
request
to
be
set
free
with
that
of

a
former

you
think
about

on

sidenote
what
is
the
bezel
of
a
ring
and
how
would
you
like
to
go
boating
on
a
petroleum
lake
there
is
a
wonderful
description
of
king
loc
s
journey
through
the
sea
cavern
does
it
recall
any
piece
of
literature
prose
or
verse
song
or
story
there
is
a
good
picture
in
the
story
of
the
meeting
of
george
and
his
rival
aristotle
was
a
greek
philosopher
who
knew
almost
everything
there
was
to
be
known
if
king
loc
had
belonged
to
our
time
we
should
call
him
a
sport
but
it
was
too
much
to
hurl
bee
s
name
at
him
without
any
preparation
on
the
whole
the
shadows
of
the
story
appear
to
be
lifting

john
s
exclamation
was
not
quite
polite
if
he
did
not
see
a
ghost
he
might
have
guessed
that
it
was
an
angel
the
people
had
given
a
natural
cause
for
the
disappearance
of
george
but
explained
bee
s
absence
in
a
more
wonderful
and
mysterious
way
with
a
touch
of
poetry
the
of
george
has
various
effects
according
to
the
character
of
the
people
he
meets
freeheart
back
again
too
and
still
at
his
old
game
of
making
a
song
about
it

it
was
the
common
people
who
were
expected
to
know
all
about
the
habits
of
the
dwarfs
glauce
is
good
fun
and
a
clever
girl
would
love
to
act
her
part
in
a
play
she
is
by
no

unimportant

the
story

what
the

said
afterwards

freeheart
s
ideas
of
costume
are
quite
original
but
his
notion
of
courage
is
not
so
praiseworthy
he
is
however
a
better
diplomatist
than
george
and
has
a
very
charming
way
of
telling
the
young
lover
that
he
has
been
foolishly
rude
george
s
entry
reception
and
meeting
with
little
king
loc

a
splendid
moving
picture
disappointment
in
love
has
not
soured
the
little
king

him
something
of
a
poet

how
gently
he
reproves
the
george
how
kind
george
is
too
in
the
midst
of
his
happiness
and
all
ends
in
and
good
fun
sidenote
the
last
scene
of
all
makes
one
long
to
have
a
play
based
upon
this
story
who
would
not
be
proud
to
act
king
loc
and
have
such
a
lofty
mind
it
would
be
difficult
of
course
to
get
together
such
a
wedding
present
as
he
gave
bee
but
the
players
could
easily
agree
to
play
the
game
of
let
s
pretend
as
shakespeare
did
when
he
hung
up
a
card
on
the
curtain
bearing
the
words
this
is
a
wood
a
true
story
well
is
it
all
about
it
is
a
story
of
and
lover
s
love
it
is
full
of
kindliness
courage
gaiety
forgiveness
compassion
helpfulness
resource
and
fortitude
and
these
things
have
always
been
true
are
true
and
will
be
true
long
long
after
we
all
reach
the
island
valley
of
avilion
so
what
greater
truth
could
we
ask
for
we
give
here
for
purposes
of
enjoyment
and
comparison
a
prose
story
and
a
poem
both
of
which
tell
the
story
of
the
greek
maiden
who
was
carried
off
to
the
dark
underworld
but
who
unlike
bee
became
the
bride
of
its
king
also
another
story
of
dwarfs
and
their
ways
sorrow
of
in
the
fields
of
enna
in
the
happy
island
of
sicily
the
beautiful
persephone
was
playing
with
the
girls
who
lived
there
with
her
she
was
the
daughter
of
the
lady
demeter
and
every
one
loved
them
both
for
demeter
was
good
and
kind
to
all
and
no
one
could
be
more
gentle
and
merry
than
persephone
she
and
her
companions
were
gathering
flowers
from
the
field
to
make
crowns
for
their
long
flowing
hair
they
had
picked
many
roses
and
lilies
and
hyacinths
which
grew
in
clusters
around
them
when
persephone
thought
she
saw
a
splendid
flower
far
off
and
away
she
ran
as
fast
as
she
could
to
get
it
it
was
a
beautiful
narcissus
with
a
hundred
heads
springing
from
one
stem
and
the
perfume
which
came
from
its
flowers
gladdened
the
broad
heaven
above
and
the
earth
and
sea
around
it
eagerly
persephone
stretched
out
her
hand
to
take
this
splendid
prize
when
the
earth
opened
and
a
chariot
stood
before
her
drawn
by
four
horses
and
in
the
chariot
there
was
a
man
with
a
dark
and
solemn
face
which
looked
as
though
he
could
never
smile
and
as
though
he
had
never
been
happy
in
a
moment
he
got
out
of
his
chariot
seized
persephone
round
the
waist
and
put
her
on
the
seat
by
his
side
then
he
touched
the
horses
with
his
whip
and
they
drew
the
chariot
down
into
the
great
gulf
and
the
earth
closed
over
them
again
presently
the
girls
who
had
been
playing
with
persephone
came
up
to
the
place
where
the
beautiful
narcissus
was
growing
but
they
could
not
see
her
anywhere
and
they
said
here
is
the
very
flower
which
she
ran
to
pick
and
there
is
no
place
here
where
she
can
be
hiding
still
for
a
long
time
they
searched
for
her
through
the
fields
of
enna
and
when
the
evening
was
come
they
went
home
to
tell
the
lady
demeter
that
they
could
not
tell
what
had
become
of
persephone
very
terrible
was
the
sorrow
of
demeter
when
she
was
told
that
her
child
was
lost
she
put
a
dark
robe
on
her
shoulders
and
took
a
flaming
torch
in
her
hand
and
went
over
land
and
sea
to
look
for
persephone
but
no
one
could
tell
her
where
she
was
gone
when
ten
days
were
passed
she
met
hekate
and
asked
her
about
her
child
but
hekate
said
i
heard
her
voice
as
she
cried
out
when
some
one
seized
her
but
i
did
not
see
it
with
my
eyes
and
so
i
know
not
where
she
is
gone
then
she
went
to
helios
and
said
to
him
o
helios
tell
me
about
my
child
thou
seest
everything
on
the
earth
sitting
in
the
bright
sun
then
helios
said
to
demeter
i
pity
thee
for
thy
great
sorrow
and
i
will
tell
thee
the
truth
it
is
hades
who
has
taken
away
persephone
to
be
his
wife
in
the
dark
and
gloomy
land
which
lies
beneath
in
the
earth
then
the
rage
of
demeter
was
more
terrible
than
her
sorrow
had
been
and
she
would
not
stay
in
the
palace
of
zeus
on
the
great
thessalian
hill
because
it
was
zeus
who
had
allowed
hades
to
take
away
persephone
so
she
went
down
from
olympus
and
wandered
on
a
long
way
until
she
came
to
eleusis
just
as
the
sun
was
going
down
into
his
golden
cup
behind
the
dark
blue
hills
there
demeter
sat
down
close
to
a
fountain
where
the
water
bubbled
out
from
the
green
turf
and
fell
into
a
clear
basin
over
which
some
dark
spread
their
branches
just
then
the
daughters
of
keleos
the
king
of
eleusis
came
to
the
fountain
with
pitchers
on
their
heads
to
draw
water
and
when
they
saw
demeter
they
knew
from
her
face
that
she
must
have
some
great
grief
and
they
spoke
kindly
to
her
and
asked
if
they
could
do
anything
to
help
her
then
she
told
them
how
she
had
lost
and
was
searching
for
her
child
and
they
said
come
home
and
live
with
us
and
our
father
and
mother
will
give
you
everything
that
you
can
want
and
do
all
that
they
can
to
soothe
your
sorrow
so
demeter
went
down
to
the
house
of
keleos
and
she
stayed
there
for
a
whole
year
and
all
this
time
although
the
daughters
of
keleos
were
very
gentle
and
kind
to
her
she
went
on
mourning
and
weeping
for
persephone
she
never
laughed
or
smiled
and
scarcely
ever
did
she
speak
to
any
one
because
of
her
great
grief
and
even
the
earth
and
the
things
which
grow
on
the
earth
mourned
for
the
sorrow
which
had
come
upon
demeter
there
was
no
fruit
upon
the
trees
no
corn
came
up
in
the
fields
and
no
flowers
blossomed
in
the
gardens
and
zeus
looked
down
from
his
high
thessalian
hill
and
saw
that
everything
must
die
unless
he
could
soothe
the
grief
and
anger
of
demeter
so
he
sent
hermes
down
to
hades
the
dark
and
stern
king
to
bid
him
send
persephone
to
see
her
mother
demeter
but
before
hades
let
her
go
he
gave
her
a
pomegranate
to
eat
because
he
did
not
wish
her
to
stay
away
from
him
always
and
he
knew
that
she
must
come
back
if
she
tasted
but
one
of
the
pomegranate
seeds
then
the
great
chariot
was
brought
before
the
door
of
the
palace
and
hermes
touched
with
his
whip
the
horses
and
away
they
went
as
swiftly
as
the
wind
until
they
came
close
to
eleusis
then
hermes
left
persephone
and
the
horses
drew
the
chariot
away
again
to
the
dark
home
of
king
hades
the
sun
was
sinking
down
in
the
sky
when
hermes
left
persephone
and
as
she
came
near
to
the
fountain
she
saw
someone
sitting
near
it
in
a
long
black
robe
and
she
knew
that
it
must
be
her
mother
who
still
wept
and
mourned
for
her
child
and
as
demeter
heard
the
rustling
of
her
dress
she
lifted
up
her
face
and
persephone
stood
before
her
then
the
joy
of
demeter
was
greater
as
she
clasped
her
daughter
to
her
breast
than
her
grief
and
her
sorrow
had
been
again
and
again
she
held
persephone
in
her
arms
and
asked
her
about
all
that
had
happened
to
her
and
she
said
now
that
you
are
come
back
to
me
i
shall
never
let
you
go
away
again
hades
shall
not
have
my
child
to
live
with
him
in
his
dreary
kingdom
but
persephone
said
it
may
not
be
so
my
mother
i
can
not
stay
with
you
always
for
before
hermes
brought
me
away
to
see
you
hades
gave
me
a
pomegranate
and
i
have
eaten
some
of
the
seeds
and
after
tasting
the
seed
i
must
go
back
to
him
again
when
six
months
have
passed
by
and
indeed
i
am
not
afraid
to
go
for
although
hades
never
smiles
or
laughs
and
everything
in
his
palace
is
dark
and
gloomy
still
he
is
very
kind
to
me
and
i
think
that
he
feels
almost
happy
since
i
have
been
his
wife
but
do
not
be
sorry
my
mother
for
he
has
promised
to
let
me
come
up
and
stay
with
you
for
six
months
in
every
year
and
the
other
six
months
i
must
spend
with
him
in
the
land
which
lies
beneath
the
earth
so
demeter
was
comforted
for
her
daughter
persephone
and
the
earth
and
all
the
things
that
grew
in
it
felt
that
her
anger
and
sorrow
had
passed
away
once
more
the
trees
bore
their
fruits
the
flowers
spread
out
their
sweet
blossoms
in
the
garden
and
the
golden
corn
waved
like
the
sea
under
the
soft
summer
breeze
so
the
six
months
passed
happily
away
and
then
hermes
came
with
the
horses
to
take
persephone
to
the
dark
land
and
she
said
to
her
mother
do
not
weep
much
the
gloomy
king
whose
wife
i
am
is
so
kind
to
me
that
i
can
not
be
really
unhappy
and
in
six
months
more
he
will
let
me
come
to
you
again
but
still
whenever
the
time
came
round
for
persephone
to
go
back
to
hades
demeter
thought
of
the
happy
days
when
her
child
was
a
merry
girl
playing
with
her
companions
and
gathering
the
bright
flowers
in
the
beautiful
plains
of
enna
king
of
the
golden
grimm
s
fairy
tales
there
was
once
a
merchant
who
had
only
one
child
a
son
that
was
very
young
and
barely
able
to
run
alone
he
had
two
richly
laden
ships
then
making
a
voyage
upon
the
seas
in
which
he
had
embarked
all
his
wealth
in
the
hope
of
making
great
gains
when
the
news
came
that
both
were
lost
thus
from
being
a
rich
man
he
became
all
at
once
so
very
poor
that
nothing
was
left
to
him
but
one
small
plot
of
land
and
there
he
often
went
in
an
evening
to
take
his
walk
and
ease
his
mind
of
a
little
of
his
trouble
one
day
as
he
was
roaming
along
in
a
brown
study
thinking
with
no
great
comfort
on
what
he
had
been
and
what
he
now
was
and
was
like
to
be
all
on
a
sudden
there
stood
before
him
a
little
black
dwarf
prithee
friend
why
so
sorrowful
said
he
to
the
merchant
what
is
it
you
take
so
deeply
to
heart
if
you
could
do
me
any
good
i
would
willingly
tell
you
said
the
merchant
who
knows
but
i
may
said
the
little
man
tell
me
what
ails
you
and
perhaps
you
will
find
i
may
be
of
some
use
then
the
merchant
told
him
how
all
his
wealth
was
gone
to
the
bottom
of
the
sea
and
how
he
had
nothing
left
but
that
little
plot
of
land
oh
trouble
not
yourself
about
that
said
the
dwarf
only
undertake
to
bring
me
here
twelve
years
hence
whatever
meets
you
first
on
your
going
home
and
i
will
give
you
as
much
as
you
please
the
merchant
thought
this
was
no
great
thing
to
ask
that
it
would
most
likely
be
his
dog
or
his
cat
or
something
of
that
sort
but
forgot
his
little
boy
heinel
so
he
agreed
to
the
bargain
and
signed
and
sealed
the
bond
to
do
what
was
asked
of
him
but
as
he
drew
near
home
his
little
boy
was
so
glad
to
see
him
that
he
crept
behind
him
and
laid
fast
hold
of
his
legs
and
looked
up
in
his
face
and
laughed
then
the
father
started
trembling
with
fear
and
horror
and
saw
what
it
was
that
he
had
bound
himself
to
do
but
as
no
gold
was
come
he
made
himself
easy
by
thinking
that
it
was
only
a
joke
that
the
dwarf
was
playing
him
and
that
at
any
rate
when
the
money
came
he
should
see
the
bearer
and
would
not
take
it
in
about
a
month
afterwards
he
went
upstairs
into
a
to
look
for
some
old
iron
that
he
might
sell
it
and
raise
a
little
money
and
there
instead
of
his
iron
he
saw
a
large
pile
of
gold
lying
on
the
floor
at
the
sight
of
this
he
was
overjoyed
and
forgetting
all
about
his
son
went
into
trade
again
and
became
a
richer
merchant
than
before
meantime
little
heinel
grew
up
and
as
the
end
of
the
twelve
years
drew
near
the
merchant
began
to
call
to
mind
his
bond
and
became
very
sad
and
thoughtful
so
that
care
and
sorrow
were
written
upon
his
face
the
boy
one
day
asked
what
was
the
matter
but
his
father
would
not
tell
for
some
time
at
last
however
he
said
that
he
had
without
knowing
it
sold
him
for
gold
to
a
little
black
dwarf
and
that
the
twelve
years
were
coming
round
when
he
must
keep
his
word
then
heinel
said
father
give
yourself
very
little
trouble
about
that
i
shall
be
too
much
for
the
little
man
when
the
time
came
the
father
and
son
went
out
together
to
the
place
agreed
upon
and
the
son
drew
a
circle
on
the
ground
and
set
himself
and
his
father
in
the
middle
of
it
the
little
black
dwarf
soon
came
and
walked
round
and
round
about
the
circle
but
could
not
find
any
way
to
get
into
it
and
he
either
could
not
or
dared
not
jump
over
it
at
last
the
boy
said
to
him
have
you
anything
to
say
to
us
my
friend
or
what
do
you
want
now
heinel
had
found
a
friend
in
a
good
fairy
that
was
fond
of
him
and
had
told
him
what
to
do
for
this
fairy
knew
what
good
luck
was
in
store
for
him
have
you
brought
me
what
you
said
you
would
said
the
dwarf
to
the
merchant
the
old
man
held
his
tongue
but
heinel
said
again
what
do
you
want
here
the
dwarf
said
i
come
to
talk
with
your
father
not
with
you
you
have
cheated
and
taken
in
my
father
said
the
son
pray
give
him
up
his
bond
at
once
fair
and
softly
said
the
little
old
man
right
is
right
i
have
paid
my
money
and
your
father
has
had
it
and
spent
it
so
be
so
good
as
to
let
me
have
what
i
paid
it
for
you
must
have
my
consent
to
that
first
said
heinel
so
please
to
step
in
here
and
let
us
talk
it
over
the
old
man
grinned
and
showed
his
teeth
as
if
he
should
have
been
very
glad
to
get
into
the
circle
if
he
could
then
at
last
after
a
long
talk
they
came
to
terms
heinel
agreed
that
his
father
must
give
him
up
and
that
so
far
the
dwarf
should
have
his
way
but
on
the
other
hand
the
fairy
had
told
heinel
what
fortune
was
in
store
for
him
if
he
followed
his
own
course
and
he
did
not
choose
to
be
given
up
to
his
friend
who
seemed
so
anxious
for
his
company
so
to
make
a
sort
of
drawn
battle
of
the
matter
it
was
settled
that
heinel
should
be
put
into
an
open
boat
that
lay
on
the
hard
by
that
the
father
should
push
him
off
with
his
own
hand
and
that
he
should
thus
be
set
adrift
and
left
to
the
bad
or
good
luck
of
wind
and
weather
then
he
took
leave
of
his
father
and
set
himself
in
the
boat
but
before
it
got
far
off
a
wave
struck
it
and
it
fell
with
one
side
low
in
the
water
so
the
merchant
thought
that
poor
heinel
was
lost
and
went
home
very
sorrowful
while
the
dwarf
went
his
way
thinking
that
at
any
rate
he
had
had
his
revenge
the
boat
however
did
not
sink
for
the
good
fairy
took
care
of
her
friend
and
soon
raised
the
boat
up
again
and
it
went
safely
on
the
young
man
sat
safe
within
till
at
length
it
ran
ashore
upon
an
unknown
land
as
he
jumped
upon
the
shore
he
saw
before
him
a
beautiful
castle
but
empty
and
dreary
within
for
it
was
enchanted
here
said
he
to
himself
must
i
find
the
prize
the
good
fairy
told
me
of
so
he
once
more
searched
the
whole
palace
through
till
at
last
he
found
a
white
snake
lying
coiled
up
on
a
cushion
in
one
of
the
chambers
now
the
white
snake
was
an
enchanted
princess
and
she
was
very
glad
to
see
him
and
said
are
you
at
last
come
to
set
me
free
twelve
long
years
have
i
waited
here
for
the
fairy
to
bring
you
hither
as
she
promised
for
you
alone
can
save
me
this
night
twelve
men
will
come
their
faces
will
be
black
and
they
will
be
dressed
in
chain
armour
they
will
ask
what
you
do
here
but
give
no
answer
and
let
them
do
what
they
will
beat
whip
pinch
prick
or
torment
you
bear
all
only
speak
not
a
word
and
at
twelve
o
clock
they
must
go
away
the
second
night
twelve
others
will
come
and
the
third
night
who
will
even
cut
off
your
head
but
at
the
twelfth
hour
of
that
night
their
power
is
gone
and
i
shall
be
free
and
will
come
and
bring
you
the
water
of
life
and
will
wash
you
with
it
and
bring
you
back
to
life
and
health
and
all
came
to
pass
as
she
had
said
heinel
bore
all
and
spoke
not
a
word
and
the
third
night
the
princess
came
and
fell
on
his
neck
and
kissed
him
joy
and
gladness
burst
forth
throughout
the
castle
the
wedding
was
celebrated
and
he
was
crowned
king
of
the
golden
mountain
they
lived
together
very
happily
and
the
queen
had
a
son
and
thus
eight
years
had
passed
over
their
heads
when
the
king
thought
of
his
father
and
he
began
to
long
to
see
him
once
again
but
the
queen
was
against
his
going
and
said
i
know
well
that
misfortunes
will
come
upon
us
if
you
go
however
he
gave
her
no
rest
till
she
agreed
at
his
going
away
she
gave
him
a
and
said
take
this
ring
and
put
it
on
your
finger
whatever
you
wish
it
will
bring
you
only
promise
never
to
make
use
of
it
to
bring
me
hence
to
your
father
s
house
then
he
said
he
would
do
what
she
asked
and
put
the
ring
on
his
finger
and
wished
himself
near
the
town
where
his
father
lived
heinel
found
himself
at
the
gates
in
a
moment
but
the
guards
would
not
let
him
go
in
because
he
was
so
strangely
clad
so
he
went
up
to
a
neighbouring
hill
where
a
shepherd
dwelt
and
borrowed
his
old
frock
and
thus
passed
unknown
into
the
town
when
he
came
to
his
father
s
house
he
said
he
was
his
son
but
the
merchant
would
not
believe
him
and
said
he
had
had
but
one
son
his
poor
heinel
who
he
knew
was
long
since
dead
and
as
he
was
only
dressed
like
a
poor
shepherd
he
would
not
even
give
him
anything
to
eat
the
king
however
still
vowed
that
he
was
his
son
and
said
is
there
no
mark
by
which
you
would
know
me
if
i
am
really
your
son
yes
said
his
mother
our
heinel
had
a
mark
like
a
raspberry
on
his
right
arm
then
he
showed
them
the
mark
and
they
knew
that
what
he
had
said
was
true
he
next
told
them
how
he
was
king
of
the
golden
mountain
and
was
married
to
a
princess
and
had
a
son
seven
years
old
but
the
merchant
said
that
can
never
be
true
he
must
be
a
fine
king
truly
who
travels
about
in
a
shepherd
s
frock
at
this
the
son
was
vexed
and
forgetting
his
word
turned
his
ring
and
wished
for
his
queen
and
son
in
an
instant
they
stood
before
him
but
the
queen
wept
and
said
he
had
broken
his
word
and
bad
luck
would
follow
he
did
all
he
could
to
soothe
her
and
she
at
last
seemed
to
be
appeased
but
she
was
not
so
in
truth
and
was
only
thinking
how
she
should
punish
him
one
day
he
took
her
to
walk
with
him
out
of
the
town
and
showed
her
the
spot
where
the
boat
was
set
adrift
upon
the
wide
waters
then
he
sat
himself
down
and
said
i
am
very
much
tired
sit
by
me
i
will
rest
my
head
in
your
lap
and
sleep
awhile
as
soon
as
he
had
fallen
asleep
however
she
drew
the
ring
from
his
finger
and
crept
softly
away
and
wished
herself
and
her
son
at
home
in
their
kingdom
and
when
he
awoke
he
found
himself
alone
and
saw
that
the
ring
was
gone
from
his
finger
i
can
never
go
back
to
my
father
s
house
said
he
they
would
say
i
am
a
sorcerer
i
will
journey
forth
into
the
world
till
i
come
again
to
my
kingdom
so
saying
he
set
out
and
travelled
till
he
came
to
a
hill
where
three
giants
were
sharing
their
father
s
goods
and
as
they
saw
him
pass
they
cried
out
and
said
little
men
have
sharp
wits
he
shall
part
the
goods
between
us
now
there
was
a
sword
that
cut
off
an
enemy
s
head
whenever
the
wearer
gave
the
words
heads
off
a
cloak
that
made
the
owner
invisible
or
gave
him
any
form
he
pleased
and
a
pair
of
boots
that
carried
the
wearer
wherever
he
wished
heinel
said
they
must
first
let
him
try
these
wonderful
things
then
he
might
know
how
to
set
a
value
upon
them
then
they
gave
him
the
cloak
and
he
wished
himself
a
fly
and
in
a
moment
he
was
a
fly
the
cloak
is
very
well
said
he
now
give
me
the
sword
no
said
they
not
unless
you
undertake
not
to
say
heads
off
for
if
you
do
we
are
all
dead
men
so
they
gave
it
him
charging
him
to
try
it
on
a
tree
he
next
asked
for
the
boots
also
and
the
moment
he
had
all
three
in
his
power
he
wished
himself
at
the
golden
mountain
and
there
he
was
at
once
so
the
giants
were
left
behind
with
no
goods
to
share
or
quarrel
about
as
heinel
came
near
his
castle
he
heard
the
sound
of
merry
music
and
the
people
around
told
him
that
his
queen
was
about
to
marry
another
husband
then
he
threw
his
cloak
around
him
and
passed
through
the
and
placed
himself
by
the
side
of
his
queen
where
no
one
saw
him
but
when
anything
to
eat
was
put
upon
her
plate
he
took
it
away
and
ate
it
himself
and
when
a
glass
of
wine
was
handed
to
her
he
took
it
and
drank
it
and
thus
though
they
kept
on
giving
her
meat
and
drink
her
plate
and
cup
were
always
empty
upon
this
fear
and
remorse
came
over
her
and
she
went
into
her
chamber
alone
and
sat
there
weeping
and
he
followed
her
there
alas
said
she
to
herself
was
i
not
once
set
free
why
then
does
this
enchantment
still
seem
to
bind
me
false
and
fickle
one
said
he
one
indeed
came
who
set
thee
free
and
he
is
now
near
thee
again
but
how
have
you
used
him
ought
he
to
have
had
such
treatment
from
thee
then
he
went
out
and
sent
away
the
company
and
said
the
wedding
was
at
an
end
for
that
he
was
come
back
to
the
kingdom
but
the
princes
peers
and
great
men
mocked
at
him
however
he
would
enter
into
no
parley
with
them
but
only
asked
them
if
they
would
go
in
peace
or
not
then
they
turned
upon
him
and
tried
to
seize
him
but
he
drew
his
sword
heads
off
cried
he
and
with
the
word
the
traitors
heads
fell
before
him
and
heinel
was
once
more
king
of
the
golden
mountain
in
some
forms
of
this
story
the
maiden
is
called
proserpina
and
her
mother
ceres
tennyson
tells
the
story
in
his
poem

she
stepped

the
maiden
left
them
both
and
parted
from
her
company
drawn
nigh
she
deemed
it
fairer
still
and
stooped
to
gather
by
the
rill
the
daffodil
the
daffodil
what
ailed
the
meadow
that
it
shook

ailed

the
daffodil
jean
ingelow
writer
of
the
story
of
the
best
way
to
learn
something
about
the
author
of
is
to
study
with
care
the
portrait
given
as
the
frontispiece
of
this
book
you
shall
form
your
own
opinion
of
the
man
from
the
artist
s
drawing
and
that
opinion
will
depend
greatly
upon
the
amount
of
enjoyment
and
the
number
of
ideas
you
have
got
from
his
story
his
name
is
sufficient
guide
to
his
nationality
and
you
will
know
by
easy
guesswork
that
you
have
been
reading
a
translation
of
his
tale
but
the
change
from
french
to
english
is
so
well
made
that
not
much
is
lost
of
the
charm
of
the
story
as
anatole
france
wrote
it
the
best
way
to
judge
his
work
is
of
course
to
read
it
in
french
anatole
france
is
not
like
hans
andersen
a
recognised
writer
which
from
our
point
of
view
seems
a
pity
because
he
has
the
light
touch
which
does
not
crush
the
gossamer
or
brush
the
dust
from
the
wings
of
the
butterfly
it
is
of
no
use
having
a
heavy
touch
if
you
are
dealing
with
things
like
queen
mab
s
wagon
her
made
of
long
spinners
legs
the
cover
of
the
wings
of
grasshoppers
her
traces
of
the
smallest
spider
s
web
her
whip
of
crickets
bone
the
lash
of
film
her
wagoner
a
small
gnat
her
chariot
is
an
empty
made
by
the
joiner
squirrel
or
old
grub
time
out
o
mind
the
fairies
one
of
our
own
writers
john
ruskin
wrote
one
fairy
tale
called
king
of
the
golden
and
the
rest
of
his
writings
like
those
of
anatole
france
were
for
readers
there
are
some
people
who
think
that
ruskin
s
fairy
tale
is
one
of
the
best
of
its
kind
ever
written
and
the
princess
of
the
is
quite
worthy
to
stand
beside
it
you
may
care
to
compare
the
two
in
matters
of
detail
and
style
and
will
find
the
work
very
interesting
indeed
and
you
will
remember
that
it
is
quite
fair
to
compare
these
two
stories
for
they
were
both
or
by
their
authors
all
out
of
their
own
heads
most
of
the
old
fairy
tales
like
cinderella
seem
to
have
grown
like
the
cabbages
or
shall
we
say
the
roses
they
have
been
told
again
and
again
by
one
person
after
another
as
the
years
rolled
by
and
they
were
well
known
before
anyone
set
them
down
in
print
in
a
sense
and
king
of
the
golden
are
not
true
fairy
tales
but
you
will
agree
that
they
are
very
good
imitations
of
the
old
models
anatole
france
whose
real
surname
is
thibault
was
the
son
of
a
bookseller
in
paris
and
was
born
so
long
ago
as
he
was
brought
up
among
books
and
among
clever
men
who
came
to
his
father
s
shop
not
only
to
buy
books
but
to
discuss
them
it
is
not
surprising
that
when
he
grew
up
he
should
begin
to
write
books
as
for
his
thoughts
about
things
in
general
you
will
find
them
all
in
the
pages
of
the
princess
of
the
the
