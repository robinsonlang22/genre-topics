somebody
asked
for
the
cigars
we
had
talked
long
and
the
conversation
was
beginning
to
languish
the
tobacco
smoke
had
got
into
the
heavy
curtains
the
wine
had
got
into
those
brains
which
were
liable
to
become
heavy
and
it
was
already
perfectly
evident
that
unless
somebody
did
something
to
rouse
our
oppressed
spirits
the
meeting
would
soon
come
to
its
natural
conclusion
and
we
the
guests
would
speedily
go
home
to
bed
and
most
certainly
to
sleep
no
one
had
said
anything
very
remarkable
it
may
be
that
no
one
had
anything
very
remarkable
to
say
jones
had
given
us
every
particular
of
his
last
hunting
adventure
in
yorkshire
tompkins
of
boston
had
explained
at
elaborate
length
those
working
principles
by
the
due
and
careful
maintenance
of
which
the
atchison
topeka
and
santa
fé
railroad
not
only
extended
its
territory
increased
its
departmental
influence
and
transported
live
stock
without
starving
them
to
death
before
the
day
of
actual
delivery
but
also
had
for
years
succeeded
in
deceiving
those
passengers
who
bought
its
tickets
into
the
fallacious
belief
that
the
corporation
aforesaid
was
really
able
to
transport
human
life
without
destroying
it
signor
tombola
had
endeavoured
to
persuade
us
by
arguments
which
we
took
no
trouble
to
oppose
that
the
unity
of
his
country
in
no
way
resembled
the
average
modern
torpedo
carefully
planned
constructed
with
all
the
skill
of
the
greatest
european
arsenals
but
when
constructed
destined
to
be
directed
by
feeble
hands
into
a
region
where
it
must
undoubtedly
explode
unseen
unfeared
and
unheard
into
the
illimitable
wastes
of
political
chaos
it
is
unnecessary
to
go
into
further
details
the
conversation
had
assumed
proportions
which
would
have
bored
prometheus
on
his
rock
which
would
have
driven
tantalus
to
distraction
and
which
would
have
impelled
ixion
to
seek
relaxation
in
the
simple
but
instructive
dialogues
of
herr
ollendorff
rather
than
submit
to
the
greater
evil
of
listening
to
our
talk
we
had
sat
at
table
for
hours
we
were
bored
we
were
tired
and
nobody
showed
signs
of
moving
somebody
called
for
cigars
we
all
instinctively
looked
towards
the
speaker
brisbane
was
a
man
of
years
of
age
and
remarkable
for
those
gifts
which
chiefly
attract
the
attention
of
men
he
was
a
strong
man
the
external
proportions
of
his
figure
presented
nothing
extraordinary
to
the
common
eye
though
his
size
was
above
the
average
he
was
a
little
over
six
feet
in
height
and
moderately
broad
in
the
shoulder
he
did
not
appear
to
be
stout
but
on
the
other
hand
he
was
certainly
not
thin
his
small
head
was
supported
by
a
strong
and
sinewy
neck
his
broad
muscular
hands
appeared
to
possess
a
peculiar
skill
in
breaking
walnuts
without
the
assistance
of
the
ordinary
cracker
and
seeing
him
in
profile
one
could
not
help
remarking
the
extraordinary
breadth
of
his
sleeves
and
the
unusual
thickness
of
his
chest
he
was
one
of
those
men
who
are
commonly
spoken
of
among
men
as
deceptive
that
is
to
say
that
though
he
looked
exceedingly
strong
he
was
in
reality
very
much
stronger
than
he
looked
of
his
features
i
need
say
little
his
head
is
small
his
hair
is
thin
his
eyes
are
blue
his
nose
is
large
he
has
a
small
moustache
and
a
square
jaw
everybody
knows
brisbane
and
when
he
asked
for
a
cigar
everybody
looked
at
him
it
is
a
very
singular
thing
said
brisbane
everybody
stopped
talking
brisbane
voice
was
not
loud
but
possessed
a
peculiar
quality
of
penetrating
general
conversation
and
cutting
it
like
a
knife
everybody
listened
brisbane
perceiving
that
he
had
attracted
their
general
attention
lit
his
cigar
with
great
equanimity
it
is
very
singular
he
continued
that
thing
about
ghosts
people
are
always
asking
whether
anybody
has
seen
a
ghost
i
have
bosh
what
you
you
do
mean
to
say
so
brisbane
well
for
a
man
of
his
intelligence
a
chorus
of
exclamations
greeted
brisbane
remarkable
statement
everybody
called
for
cigars
and
stubbs
the
butler
suddenly
appeared
from
the
depths
of
nowhere
with
a
fresh
bottle
of
dry
champagne
the
situation
was
saved
brisbane
was
going
to
tell
a
story
i
am
an
old
sailor
said
brisbane
and
as
i
have
to
cross
the
atlantic
pretty
often
i
have
my
favourites
most
men
have
their
favourites
i
have
seen
a
man
wait
in
a
broadway
bar
for
of
an
hour
for
a
particular
car
which
he
liked
i
believe
the
made
at
least
of
his
living
by
that
man
preference
i
have
a
habit
of
waiting
for
certain
ships
when
i
am
obliged
to
cross
that
it
may
be
a
prejudice
but
i
was
never
cheated
out
of
a
good
passage
but
once
in
my
life
i
remember
it
very
well
it
was
a
warm
morning
in
june
and
the
custom
house
officials
who
were
hanging
about
waiting
for
a
steamer
already
on
her
way
up
from
the
quarantine
presented
a
peculiarly
hazy
and
thoughtful
appearance
i
had
not
much
luggage
i
never
have
i
mingled
with
the
crowd
of
passengers
porters
and
officious
individuals
in
blue
coats
and
brass
buttons
who
seemed
to
spring
up
like
mushrooms
from
the
deck
of
a
moored
steamer
to
obtrude
their
unnecessary
services
upon
the
independent
passenger
i
have
often
noticed
with
a
certain
interest
the
spontaneous
evolution
of
these
fellows
they
are
not
there
when
you
arrive
five
minutes
after
the
pilot
has
called
go
ahead
they
or
at
least
their
blue
coats
and
brass
buttons
have
disappeared
from
deck
and
gangway
as
completely
as
though
they
had
been
consigned
to
that
locker
which
tradition
unanimously
ascribes
to
davy
jones
but
at
the
moment
of
starting
they
are
there
and
ravenous
for
fees
i
hastened
on
board
the
was
one
of
my
favourite
ships
i
say
was
because
she
emphatically
no
longer
is
i
can
not
conceive
of
any
inducement
which
could
entice
me
to
make
another
voyage
in
her
yes
i
know
what
you
are
going
to
say
she
is
uncommonly
clean
in
the
run
aft
she
has
enough
bluffing
off
in
the
bows
to
keep
her
dry
and
the
lower
berths
are
most
of
them
double
she
has
a
lot
of
advantages
but
i
cross
in
her
again
excuse
the
digression
i
got
on
board
i
hailed
a
steward
whose
red
nose
and
redder
whiskers
were
equally
familiar
to
me
one
hundred
and
five
lower
berth
said
i
in
the
businesslike
tone
peculiar
to
men
who
think
no
more
of
crossing
the
atlantic
than
taking
a
whisky
cocktail
at
downtown
delmonico
the
steward
took
my
portmanteau
great
coat
and
rug
i
shall
never
forget
the
expression
of
his
face
not
that
he
turned
pale
it
is
maintained
by
the
most
eminent
divines
that
even
miracles
can
not
change
the
course
of
nature
i
have
no
hesitation
in
saying
that
he
did
not
turn
pale
but
from
his
expression
i
judged
that
he
was
either
about
to
shed
tears
to
sneeze
or
to
drop
my
portmanteau
as
the
latter
contained
two
bottles
of
particularly
fine
old
sherry
presented
to
me
for
my
voyage
by
my
old
friend
snigginson
van
pickyns
i
felt
extremely
nervous
but
the
steward
did
none
of
these
things
well
i
d
d
said
he
in
a
low
voice
and
led
the
way
i
supposed
my
hermes
as
he
led
me
to
the
lower
regions
had
had
a
little
grog
but
i
said
nothing
and
followed
him
one
hundred
and
five
was
on
the
port
side
well
aft
there
was
nothing
remarkable
about
the
the
lower
berth
like
most
of
those
upon
the
was
double
there
was
plenty
of
room
there
was
the
usual
washing
apparatus
calculated
to
convey
an
idea
of
luxury
to
the
mind
of
a
indian
there
were
the
usual
inefficient
racks
of
brown
wood
in
which
it
is
more
easy
to
hang
a
umbrella
than
the
common
of
commerce
upon
the
uninviting
mattresses
were
carefully
folded
together
those
blankets
which
a
great
modern
humorist
has
aptly
compared
to
cold
buckwheat
cakes
the
question
of
towels
was
left
entirely
to
the
imagination
the
glass
decanters
were
filled
with
a
transparent
liquid
faintly
tinged
with
brown
but
from
which
an
odor
less
faint
but
not
more
pleasing
ascended
to
the
nostrils
like
a
reminiscence
of
oily
machinery
curtains
the
upper
berth
the
hazy
june
daylight
shed
a
faint
illumination
upon
the
desolate
little
scene
ugh
how
i
hate
that
the
steward
deposited
my
traps
and
looked
at
me
as
though
he
wanted
to
get
away
probably
in
search
of
more
passengers
and
more
fees
it
is
always
a
good
plan
to
start
in
favour
with
those
functionaries
and
i
accordingly
gave
him
certain
coins
there
and
then
i
try
and
make
yer
comfortable
all
i
can
he
remarked
as
he
put
the
coins
in
his
pocket
nevertheless
there
was
a
doubtful
intonation
in
his
voice
which
surprised
me
possibly
his
scale
of
fees
had
gone
up
and
he
was
not
satisfied
but
on
the
whole
i
was
inclined
to
think
that
as
he
himself
would
have
expressed
it
he
was
the
better
for
a
glass
i
was
wrong
however
and
did
the
man
injustice
ii
nothing
especially
worthy
of
mention
occurred
during
that
day
we
left
the
pier
punctually
and
it
was
very
pleasant
to
be
fairly
under
way
for
the
weather
was
warm
and
sultry
and
the
motion
of
the
steamer
produced
a
refreshing
breeze
everybody
knows
what
the
first
day
at
sea
is
like
people
pace
the
decks
and
stare
at
each
other
and
occasionally
meet
acquaintances
whom
they
did
not
know
to
be
on
board
there
is
the
usual
uncertainty
as
to
whether
the
food
will
be
good
bad
or
indifferent
until
the
first
two
meals
have
put
the
matter
beyond
a
doubt
there
is
the
usual
uncertainty
about
the
weather
until
the
ship
is
fairly
off
fire
island
the
tables
are
crowded
at
first
and
then
suddenly
thinned
people
spring
from
their
seats
and
precipitate
themselves
towards
the
door
and
each
old
sailor
breathes
more
freely
as
his
neighbour
rushes
from
his
side
leaving
him
plenty
of
elbow
room
and
an
unlimited
command
over
the
mustard
one
passage
across
the
atlantic
is
very
much
like
another
and
we
who
cross
very
often
do
not
make
the
voyage
for
the
sake
of
novelty
whales
and
icebergs
are
indeed
always
objects
of
interest
but
after
all
one
whale
is
very
much
like
another
whale
and
one
rarely
sees
an
iceberg
at
close
quarters
to
the
majority
of
us
the
most
delightful
moment
of
the
day
on
board
an
ocean
steamer
is
when
we
have
taken
our
last
turn
on
deck
have
smoked
our
last
cigar
and
having
succeeded
in
tiring
ourselves
feel
at
liberty
to
turn
in
with
a
clear
conscience
on
that
first
night
of
the
voyage
i
felt
particularly
lazy
and
went
to
bed
in
one
hundred
and
five
rather
earlier
than
i
usually
do
as
i
turned
in
i
was
amazed
to
see
that
i
was
to
have
a
companion
a
portmanteau
very
like
my
own
lay
in
the
opposite
corner
and
in
the
upper
berth
had
been
deposited
a
neatly
folded
rug
with
a
stick
and
umbrella
i
had
hoped
to
be
alone
and
i
was
disappointed
but
i
wondered
who
my
was
to
be
and
i
determined
to
have
a
look
at
him
before
i
had
been
long
in
bed
he
entered
he
was
as
far
as
i
could
see
a
very
tall
man
very
thin
very
pale
with
sandy
hair
and
whiskers
and
colourless
grey
eyes
he
had
about
him
i
thought
an
air
of
rather
dubious
fashion
the
sort
of
man
you
might
see
in
wall
street
without
being
able
precisely
to
say
what
he
was
doing
there
the
sort
of
man
who
frequents
the
café
anglais
who
always
seems
to
be
alone
and
who
drinks
champagne
you
might
meet
him
on
a
but
he
would
never
appear
to
be
doing
anything
there
either
a
little
a
little
odd
there
are
three
or
four
of
his
kind
on
every
ocean
steamer
i
made
up
my
mind
that
i
did
not
care
to
make
his
acquaintance
and
i
went
to
sleep
saying
to
myself
that
i
would
study
his
habits
in
order
to
avoid
him
if
he
rose
early
i
would
rise
late
if
he
went
to
bed
late
i
would
go
to
bed
early
i
did
not
care
to
know
him
if
you
once
know
people
of
that
kind
they
are
always
turning
up
poor
fellow
i
need
not
have
taken
the
trouble
to
come
to
so
many
decisions
about
him
for
i
never
saw
him
again
after
that
first
night
in
one
hundred
and
five
i
was
sleeping
soundly
when
i
was
suddenly
waked
by
a
loud
noise
to
judge
from
the
sound
my
must
have
sprung
with
a
single
leap
from
the
upper
berth
to
the
floor
i
heard
him
fumbling
with
the
latch
and
bolt
of
the
door
which
opened
almost
immediately
and
then
i
heard
his
footsteps
as
he
ran
at
full
speed
down
the
passage
leaving
the
door
open
behind
him
the
ship
was
rolling
a
little
and
i
expected
to
hear
him
stumble
or
fall
but
he
ran
as
though
he
were
running
for
his
life
the
door
swung
on
its
hinges
with
the
motion
of
the
vessel
and
the
sound
annoyed
me
i
got
up
and
shut
it
and
groped
my
way
back
to
my
berth
in
the
darkness
i
went
to
sleep
again
but
i
have
no
idea
how
long
i
slept
when
i
awoke
it
was
still
quite
dark
but
i
felt
a
disagreeable
sensation
of
cold
and
it
seemed
to
me
that
the
air
was
damp
you
know
the
peculiar
smell
of
a
cabin
which
has
been
wet
with
sea
water
i
covered
myself
up
as
well
as
i
could
and
dozed
off
again
framing
complaints
to
be
made
the
next
day
and
selecting
the
most
powerful
epithets
in
the
language
i
could
hear
my
turn
over
in
the
upper
berth
he
had
probably
returned
while
i
was
asleep
once
i
thought
i
heard
him
groan
and
i
argued
that
he
was
that
is
particularly
unpleasant
when
one
is
below
nevertheless
i
dozed
off
and
slept
till
early
daylight
the
ship
was
rolling
heavily
much
more
than
on
the
previous
evening
and
the
grey
light
which
came
in
through
the
porthole
changed
in
tint
with
every
movement
according
as
the
angle
of
the
vessel
side
turned
the
glass
seawards
or
skywards
it
was
very
cold
unaccountably
so
for
the
month
of
june
i
turned
my
head
and
looked
at
the
porthole
and
saw
to
my
surprise
that
it
was
wide
open
and
hooked
back
i
believe
i
swore
audibly
then
i
got
up
and
shut
it
as
i
turned
back
i
glanced
at
the
upper
berth
the
curtains
were
drawn
close
together
my
companion
had
probably
felt
cold
as
well
as
i
it
struck
me
that
i
had
slept
enough
the
was
uncomfortable
though
strange
to
say
i
could
not
smell
the
dampness
which
had
annoyed
me
in
the
night
my
was
still
asleep
excellent
opportunity
for
avoiding
him
so
i
dressed
at
once
and
went
on
deck
the
day
was
warm
and
cloudy
with
an
oily
smell
on
the
water
it
was
seven
as
i
came
out
much
later
than
i
had
imagined
i
came
across
the
doctor
who
was
taking
his
first
sniff
of
the
morning
air
he
was
a
young
man
from
the
west
of
ireland
a
tremendous
fellow
with
black
hair
and
blue
eyes
already
inclined
to
be
stout
he
had
a
healthy
look
about
him
which
was
rather
attractive
fine
morning
i
remarked
by
way
of
introduction
well
said
he
eying
me
with
an
air
of
ready
interest
it
a
fine
morning
and
it
not
a
fine
morning
i
do
think
it
much
of
a
morning
well
no
it
is
not
so
very
fine
said
i
it
just
what
i
call
fuggly
weather
replied
the
doctor
it
was
very
cold
last
night
i
thought
i
remarked
however
when
i
looked
about
i
found
that
the
porthole
was
wide
open
i
had
not
noticed
it
when
i
went
to
bed
and
the
was
damp
too
damp
said
he
whereabouts
are
you
one
hundred
and
five
to
my
surprise
the
doctor
started
visibly
and
stared
at
me
what
is
the
matter
i
asked
oh
nothing
he
answered
only
everybody
has
complained
of
that
for
the
last
three
trips
i
shall
complain
too
i
said
it
has
certainly
not
been
properly
aired
it
is
a
shame
i
do
believe
it
can
be
helped
answered
the
doctor
i
believe
there
is
something
well
it
is
not
my
business
to
frighten
passengers
you
need
not
be
afraid
of
frightening
me
i
replied
i
can
stand
any
amount
of
damp
if
i
should
get
a
bad
cold
i
will
come
to
you
i
offered
the
doctor
a
cigar
which
he
took
and
examined
very
critically
it
is
not
so
much
the
damp
he
remarked
however
i
dare
say
you
will
get
on
very
well
have
you
a
yes
a
deuce
of
a
fellow
who
bolts
out
in
the
middle
of
the
night
and
leaves
the
door
open
again
the
doctor
glanced
curiously
at
me
then
he
lit
the
cigar
and
looked
grave
did
he
come
back
he
asked
presently
yes
i
was
asleep
but
i
waked
up
and
heard
him
moving
then
i
felt
cold
and
went
to
sleep
again
this
morning
i
found
the
porthole
open
look
here
said
the
doctor
quietly
i
do
care
much
for
this
ship
i
do
care
a
rap
for
her
reputation
i
tell
you
what
i
will
do
i
have
a
place
up
here
i
will
share
it
with
you
though
i
know
you
from
adam
i
was
very
much
surprised
at
the
proposition
i
could
not
imagine
why
he
should
take
such
a
sudden
interest
in
my
welfare
however
his
manner
as
he
spoke
of
the
ship
was
peculiar
you
are
very
good
doctor
i
said
but
really
i
believe
even
now
the
cabin
could
be
aired
or
cleaned
out
or
something
why
do
you
not
care
for
the
ship
we
are
not
superstitious
in
our
profession
sir
replied
the
doctor
but
the
sea
makes
people
so
i
do
want
to
prejudice
you
and
i
want
to
frighten
you
but
if
you
will
take
my
advice
you
will
move
in
here
i
would
as
soon
see
you
overboard
he
added
as
know
that
you
or
any
other
man
was
to
sleep
in
one
hundred
and
five
good
gracious
why
i
asked
just
because
on
the
last
three
trips
the
people
who
have
slept
there
actually
have
gone
overboard
he
answered
gravely
the
intelligence
was
startling
and
exceedingly
unpleasant
i
confess
i
looked
hard
at
the
doctor
to
see
whether
he
was
making
game
of
me
but
he
looked
perfectly
serious
i
thanked
him
warmly
for
his
offer
but
told
him
i
intended
to
be
the
exception
to
the
rule
by
which
every
one
who
slept
in
that
particular
went
overboard
he
did
not
say
much
but
looked
as
grave
as
ever
and
hinted
that
before
we
got
across
i
should
probably
reconsider
his
proposal
in
the
course
of
time
we
went
to
breakfast
at
which
only
an
inconsiderable
number
of
passengers
assembled
i
noticed
that
one
or
two
of
the
officers
who
breakfasted
with
us
looked
grave
after
breakfast
i
went
into
my
in
order
to
get
a
book
the
curtains
of
the
upper
berth
were
still
closely
drawn
not
a
word
was
to
be
heard
my
was
probably
still
asleep
as
i
came
out
i
met
the
steward
whose
business
it
was
to
look
after
me
he
whispered
that
the
captain
wanted
to
see
me
and
then
scuttled
away
down
the
passage
as
if
very
anxious
to
avoid
any
questions
i
went
toward
the
captain
cabin
and
found
him
waiting
for
me
sir
said
he
i
want
to
ask
a
favour
of
you
i
answered
that
i
would
do
anything
to
oblige
him
your
has
disappeared
he
said
he
is
known
to
have
turned
in
early
last
night
did
you
notice
anything
extraordinary
in
his
manner
the
question
coming
as
it
did
in
exact
confirmation
of
the
fears
the
doctor
had
expressed
half
an
hour
earlier
staggered
me
you
do
mean
to
say
he
has
gone
overboard
i
asked
i
fear
he
has
answered
the
captain
this
is
the
most
extraordinary
thing
i
began
why
he
asked
he
is
the
fourth
then
i
explained
in
answer
to
another
question
from
the
captain
i
explained
without
mentioning
the
doctor
that
i
had
heard
the
story
concerning
one
hundred
and
five
he
seemed
very
much
annoyed
at
hearing
that
i
knew
of
it
i
told
him
what
had
occurred
in
the
night
what
you
say
he
replied
coincides
almost
exactly
with
what
was
told
me
by
the
of
two
of
the
other
three
they
bolt
out
of
bed
and
run
down
the
passage
two
of
them
were
seen
to
go
overboard
by
the
watch
we
stopped
and
lowered
boats
but
they
were
not
found
nobody
however
saw
or
heard
the
man
who
was
lost
last
night
if
he
is
really
lost
the
steward
who
is
a
superstitious
fellow
perhaps
and
expected
something
to
go
wrong
went
to
look
for
him
this
morning
and
found
his
berth
empty
but
his
clothes
lying
about
just
as
he
had
left
them
the
steward
was
the
only
man
on
board
who
knew
him
by
sight
and
he
has
been
searching
everywhere
for
him
he
has
disappeared
now
sir
i
want
to
beg
you
not
to
mention
the
circumstance
to
any
of
the
passengers
i
do
want
the
ship
to
get
a
bad
name
and
nothing
hangs
about
an
like
stories
of
suicides
you
shall
have
your
choice
of
any
one
of
the
officers
cabins
you
like
including
my
own
for
the
rest
of
the
passage
is
that
a
fair
bargain
very
said
i
and
i
am
much
obliged
to
you
but
since
i
am
alone
and
have
the
to
myself
i
would
rather
not
move
if
the
steward
will
take
out
that
unfortunate
man
things
i
would
as
leave
stay
where
i
am
i
will
not
say
anything
about
the
matter
and
i
think
i
can
promise
you
that
i
will
not
follow
my
the
captain
tried
to
dissuade
me
from
my
intention
but
i
preferred
having
a
alone
to
being
the
chum
of
any
officer
on
board
i
do
not
know
whether
i
acted
foolishly
but
if
i
had
taken
his
advice
i
should
have
had
nothing
more
to
tell
there
would
have
remained
the
disagreeable
coincidence
of
several
suicides
occurring
among
men
who
had
slept
in
the
same
cabin
but
that
would
have
been
all
that
was
not
the
end
of
the
matter
however
by
any
means
i
obstinately
made
up
my
mind
that
i
would
not
be
disturbed
by
such
tales
and
i
even
went
so
far
as
to
argue
the
question
with
the
captain
there
was
something
wrong
about
the
i
said
it
was
rather
damp
the
porthole
had
been
left
open
last
night
my
might
have
been
ill
when
he
came
on
board
and
he
might
have
become
delirious
after
he
went
to
bed
he
might
even
now
be
hiding
somewhere
on
board
and
might
be
found
later
the
place
ought
to
be
aired
and
the
fastening
of
the
port
looked
to
if
the
captain
would
give
me
leave
i
would
see
that
what
i
thought
necessary
were
done
immediately
of
course
you
have
a
right
to
stay
where
you
are
if
you
please
he
replied
rather
petulantly
but
i
wish
you
would
turn
out
and
let
me
lock
the
place
up
and
be
done
with
it
i
did
not
see
it
in
the
same
light
and
left
the
captain
after
promising
to
be
silent
concerning
the
disappearance
of
my
companion
the
latter
had
had
no
acquaintances
on
board
and
was
not
missed
in
the
course
of
the
day
towards
evening
i
met
the
doctor
again
and
he
asked
me
whether
i
had
changed
my
mind
i
told
him
i
had
not
then
you
will
before
long
he
said
very
gravely
iii
we
played
whist
in
the
evening
and
i
went
to
bed
late
i
will
confess
now
that
i
felt
a
disagreeable
sensation
when
i
entered
my
i
could
not
help
thinking
of
the
tall
man
i
had
seen
on
the
previous
night
who
was
now
dead
drowned
tossing
about
in
the
long
swell
two
or
three
hundred
miles
astern
his
face
rose
very
distinctly
before
me
as
i
undressed
and
i
even
went
so
far
as
to
draw
back
the
curtains
of
the
upper
berth
as
though
to
persuade
myself
that
he
was
actually
gone
i
also
bolted
the
door
of
the
suddenly
i
became
aware
that
the
porthole
was
open
and
fastened
back
this
was
more
than
i
could
stand
i
hastily
threw
on
my
and
went
in
search
of
robert
the
steward
of
my
passage
i
was
very
angry
i
remember
and
when
i
found
him
i
dragged
him
roughly
to
the
door
of
one
hundred
and
five
and
pushed
him
towards
the
open
porthole
what
the
deuce
do
you
mean
you
scoundrel
by
leaving
that
port
open
every
night
do
you
know
it
is
against
the
regulations
do
you
know
that
if
the
ship
heeled
and
the
water
began
to
come
in
ten
men
could
not
shut
it
i
will
report
you
to
the
captain
you
blackguard
for
endangering
the
ship
i
was
exceedingly
wroth
the
man
trembled
and
turned
pale
and
then
began
to
shut
the
round
glass
plate
with
the
heavy
brass
fittings
why
do
you
answer
me
i
said
roughly
if
you
please
sir
faltered
robert
there
nobody
on
board
as
can
keep
this
port
shut
at
night
you
can
try
it
yourself
sir
i
to
stop
hany
longer
on
board
o
this
vessel
sir
i
ai
indeed
but
if
i
was
you
sir
i
just
clear
out
and
go
and
sleep
with
the
surgeon
or
something
i
would
look
sir
is
that
fastened
what
you
may
call
securely
or
not
sir
try
it
sir
see
if
it
will
move
a
hinch
i
tried
the
port
and
found
it
perfectly
tight
well
sir
continued
robert
triumphantly
i
wager
my
reputation
as
a
steward
that
in
an
hour
it
will
be
open
again
fastened
back
too
sir
that
the
horful
thing
fastened
back
i
examined
the
great
screw
and
the
looped
nut
that
ran
on
it
if
i
find
it
open
in
the
night
robert
i
will
give
you
a
sovereign
it
is
not
possible
you
may
go
soverin
did
you
say
sir
very
good
sir
thank
ye
sir
good
night
sir
pleasant
reepose
sir
and
all
manner
of
hinchantin
dreams
sir
robert
scuttled
away
delighted
at
being
released
of
course
i
thought
he
was
trying
to
account
for
his
negligence
by
a
silly
story
intended
to
frighten
me
and
i
disbelieved
him
the
consequence
was
that
he
got
his
sovereign
and
i
spent
a
very
peculiarly
unpleasant
night
i
went
to
bed
and
five
minutes
after
i
had
rolled
myself
up
in
my
blankets
the
inexorable
robert
extinguished
the
light
that
burned
steadily
behind
the
pane
near
the
door
i
lay
quite
still
in
the
dark
trying
to
go
to
sleep
but
i
soon
found
that
impossible
it
had
been
some
satisfaction
to
be
angry
with
the
steward
and
the
diversion
had
banished
that
unpleasant
sensation
i
had
at
first
experienced
when
i
thought
of
the
drowned
man
who
had
been
my
chum
but
i
was
no
longer
sleepy
and
i
lay
awake
for
some
time
occasionally
glancing
at
the
porthole
which
i
could
just
see
from
where
i
lay
and
which
in
the
darkness
looked
like
a
suspended
in
blackness
i
believe
i
must
have
lain
there
for
an
hour
and
as
i
remember
i
was
just
dozing
into
sleep
when
i
was
roused
by
a
draught
of
cold
air
and
by
distinctly
feeling
the
spray
of
the
sea
blown
upon
my
face
i
started
to
my
feet
and
not
having
allowed
in
the
dark
for
the
motion
of
the
ship
i
was
instantly
thrown
violently
across
the
upon
the
couch
which
was
placed
beneath
the
porthole
i
recovered
myself
immediately
however
and
climbed
upon
my
knees
the
porthole
was
again
wide
open
and
fastened
back
now
these
things
are
facts
i
was
wide
awake
when
i
got
up
and
i
should
certainly
have
been
waked
by
the
fall
had
i
still
been
dozing
moreover
i
bruised
my
elbows
and
knees
badly
and
the
bruises
were
there
on
the
following
morning
to
testify
to
the
fact
if
i
myself
had
doubted
it
the
porthole
was
wide
open
and
fastened
back
a
thing
so
unaccountable
that
i
remember
very
well
feeling
astonishment
rather
than
fear
when
i
discovered
it
i
at
once
closed
the
plate
again
and
screwed
down
the
loop
nut
with
all
my
strength
it
was
very
dark
in
the
i
reflected
that
the
port
had
certainly
been
opened
within
an
hour
after
robert
had
at
first
shut
it
in
my
presence
and
i
determined
to
watch
it
and
see
whether
it
would
open
again
those
brass
fittings
are
very
heavy
and
by
no
means
easy
to
move
i
could
not
believe
that
the
clump
had
been
turned
by
the
shaking
of
the
screw
i
stood
peering
out
through
the
thick
glass
at
the
alternate
white
and
grey
streaks
of
the
sea
that
foamed
beneath
the
ship
side
i
must
have
remained
there
a
quarter
of
an
hour
suddenly
as
i
stood
i
distinctly
heard
something
moving
behind
me
in
one
of
the
berths
and
a
moment
afterwards
just
as
i
turned
instinctively
to
look
though
i
could
of
course
see
nothing
in
the
darkness
i
heard
a
very
faint
groan
i
sprang
across
the
and
tore
the
curtains
of
the
upper
berth
aside
thrusting
in
my
hands
to
discover
if
there
were
any
one
there
there
was
some
one
i
remember
that
the
sensation
as
i
put
my
hands
forward
was
as
though
i
were
plunging
them
into
the
air
of
a
damp
cellar
and
from
behind
the
curtain
came
a
gust
of
wind
that
smelled
horribly
of
stagnant
i
laid
hold
of
something
that
had
the
shape
of
a
man
arm
but
was
smooth
and
wet
and
icy
cold
but
suddenly
as
i
pulled
the
creature
sprang
violently
forward
against
me
a
clammy
oozy
mass
as
it
seemed
to
me
heavy
and
wet
yet
endowed
with
a
sort
of
supernatural
strength
i
reeled
across
the
and
in
an
instant
the
door
opened
and
the
thing
rushed
out
i
had
not
had
time
to
be
frightened
and
quickly
recovering
myself
i
sprang
through
the
door
and
gave
chase
at
the
top
of
my
speed
but
i
was
too
late
ten
yards
before
me
i
could
see
i
am
sure
i
saw
it
a
dark
shadow
moving
in
the
dimly
lighted
passage
quickly
as
the
shadow
of
a
fast
horse
thrown
before
a
by
the
lamp
on
a
dark
night
but
in
a
moment
it
had
disappeared
and
i
found
myself
holding
on
to
the
polished
rail
that
ran
along
the
bulkhead
where
the
passage
turned
towards
the
companion
my
hair
stood
on
end
and
the
cold
perspiration
rolled
down
my
face
i
am
not
ashamed
of
it
in
the
least
i
was
very
badly
frightened
still
i
doubted
my
senses
and
pulled
myself
together
it
was
absurd
i
thought
the
welsh
i
had
eaten
had
disagreed
with
me
i
had
been
in
a
nightmare
i
made
my
way
back
to
my
and
entered
it
with
an
effort
the
whole
place
smelled
of
stagnant
as
it
had
when
i
had
waked
on
the
previous
evening
it
required
my
utmost
strength
to
go
in
and
grope
among
my
things
for
a
box
of
wax
lights
as
i
lighted
a
railway
reading
lantern
which
i
always
carry
in
case
i
want
to
read
after
the
lamps
are
out
i
perceived
that
the
porthole
was
again
open
and
a
sort
of
creeping
horror
began
to
take
possession
of
me
which
i
never
felt
before
nor
wish
to
feel
again
but
i
got
a
light
and
proceeded
to
examine
the
upper
berth
expecting
to
find
it
drenched
with
but
i
was
disappointed
the
bed
had
been
slept
in
and
the
smell
of
the
sea
was
strong
but
the
bedding
was
as
dry
as
a
bone
i
fancied
that
robert
had
not
had
the
courage
to
make
the
bed
after
the
accident
of
the
previous
night
it
had
all
been
a
hideous
dream
i
drew
the
curtains
back
as
far
as
i
could
and
examined
the
place
very
carefully
it
was
perfectly
dry
but
the
porthole
was
open
again
with
a
sort
of
dull
bewilderment
of
horror
i
closed
it
and
screwed
it
down
and
thrusting
my
heavy
stick
through
the
brass
loop
wrenched
it
with
all
my
might
till
the
thick
metal
began
to
bend
under
the
pressure
then
i
hooked
my
reading
lantern
into
the
red
velvet
at
the
head
of
the
couch
and
sat
down
to
recover
my
senses
if
i
could
i
sat
there
all
night
unable
to
think
of
rest
hardly
able
to
think
at
all
but
the
porthole
remained
closed
and
i
did
not
believe
it
would
now
open
again
without
the
application
of
a
considerable
force
the
morning
dawned
at
last
and
i
dressed
myself
slowly
thinking
over
all
that
had
happened
in
the
night
it
was
a
beautiful
day
and
i
went
on
deck
glad
to
get
out
in
the
early
pure
sunshine
and
to
smell
the
breeze
from
the
blue
water
so
different
from
the
noisome
stagnant
odour
from
my
instinctively
i
turned
aft
towards
the
surgeon
cabin
there
he
stood
with
a
pipe
in
his
mouth
taking
his
morning
airing
precisely
as
on
the
preceding
day
said
he
quietly
but
looking
at
me
with
evident
curiosity
doctor
you
were
quite
right
said
i
there
is
something
wrong
about
that
place
i
thought
you
would
change
your
mind
he
answered
rather
triumphantly
you
have
had
a
bad
night
eh
shall
i
make
you
a
i
have
a
capital
recipe
no
thanks
i
cried
but
i
would
like
to
tell
you
what
happened
i
then
tried
to
explain
as
clearly
as
possible
precisely
what
had
occurred
not
omitting
to
state
that
i
had
been
scared
as
i
had
never
been
scared
in
my
whole
life
before
i
dwelt
particularly
on
the
phenomenon
of
the
porthole
which
was
a
fact
to
which
i
could
testify
even
if
the
rest
had
been
an
illusion
i
had
closed
it
twice
in
the
night
and
the
second
time
i
had
actually
bent
the
brass
in
wrenching
it
with
my
stick
i
believe
i
insisted
a
good
deal
on
this
point
you
seem
to
think
i
am
likely
to
doubt
the
story
said
the
doctor
smiling
at
the
detailed
account
of
the
state
of
the
porthole
i
do
not
doubt
it
in
the
least
i
renew
my
invitation
to
you
bring
your
traps
here
and
take
half
my
cabin
come
and
take
half
of
mine
for
one
night
i
said
help
me
to
get
at
the
bottom
of
this
thing
you
will
get
to
the
bottom
of
something
else
if
you
try
answered
the
doctor
what
i
asked
the
bottom
of
the
sea
i
am
going
to
leave
the
ship
it
is
not
canny
then
you
will
not
help
me
to
find
out
not
i
said
the
doctor
quickly
it
is
my
business
to
keep
my
wits
about
me
not
to
go
fiddling
about
with
ghosts
and
things
do
you
really
believe
it
is
a
ghost
i
inquired
rather
contemptuously
but
as
i
spoke
i
remembered
very
well
the
horrible
sensation
of
the
supernatural
which
had
got
possession
of
me
during
the
night
the
doctor
turned
sharply
on
me
have
you
any
reasonable
explanation
of
these
things
to
offer
he
asked
no
you
have
not
well
you
say
you
will
find
an
explanation
i
say
that
you
wo
sir
simply
because
there
is
not
any
but
my
dear
sir
i
retorted
do
you
a
man
of
science
mean
to
tell
me
that
such
things
can
not
be
explained
i
do
he
answered
stoutly
and
if
they
could
i
would
not
be
concerned
in
the
explanation
i
did
not
care
to
spend
another
night
alone
in
the
and
yet
i
was
obstinately
determined
to
get
at
the
root
of
the
disturbances
i
do
not
believe
there
are
many
men
who
would
have
slept
there
alone
after
passing
two
such
nights
but
i
made
up
my
mind
to
try
it
if
i
could
not
get
any
one
to
share
a
watch
with
me
the
doctor
was
evidently
not
inclined
for
such
an
experiment
he
said
he
was
a
surgeon
and
that
in
case
any
accident
occurred
on
board
he
must
always
be
in
readiness
he
could
not
afford
to
have
his
nerves
unsettled
perhaps
he
was
quite
right
but
i
am
inclined
to
think
that
his
precaution
was
prompted
by
his
inclination
on
inquiry
he
informed
me
that
there
was
no
one
on
board
who
would
be
likely
to
join
me
in
my
investigations
and
after
a
little
more
conversation
i
left
him
a
little
later
i
met
the
captain
and
told
him
my
story
i
said
that
if
no
one
would
spend
the
night
with
me
i
would
ask
leave
to
have
the
light
burning
all
night
and
would
try
it
alone
look
here
said
he
i
will
tell
you
what
i
will
do
i
will
share
your
watch
myself
and
we
will
see
what
happens
it
is
my
belief
that
we
can
find
out
between
us
there
may
be
some
fellow
skulking
on
board
who
steals
a
passage
by
frightening
the
passengers
it
is
just
possible
that
there
may
be
something
queer
in
the
carpentering
of
that
berth
i
suggested
taking
the
ship
carpenter
below
and
examining
the
place
but
i
was
overjoyed
at
the
captain
offer
to
spend
the
night
with
me
he
accordingly
sent
for
the
workman
and
ordered
him
to
do
anything
i
required
we
went
below
at
once
i
had
all
the
bedding
cleared
out
of
the
upper
berth
and
we
examined
the
place
thoroughly
to
see
if
there
was
a
board
loose
anywhere
or
a
panel
which
could
be
opened
or
pushed
aside
we
tried
the
planks
everywhere
tapped
the
flooring
unscrewed
the
fittings
of
the
lower
berth
and
took
it
to
pieces
in
short
there
was
not
a
square
inch
of
the
which
was
not
searched
and
tested
everything
was
in
perfect
order
and
we
put
everything
back
in
its
place
as
we
were
finishing
our
work
robert
came
to
the
door
and
looked
in
well
sir
find
anything
sir
he
asked
with
a
ghastly
grin
you
were
right
about
the
porthole
robert
i
said
and
i
gave
him
the
promised
sovereign
the
carpenter
did
his
work
silently
and
skilfully
following
my
directions
when
he
had
done
he
spoke
i
a
plain
man
sir
he
said
but
it
my
belief
you
had
better
just
turn
out
your
things
and
let
me
run
half
a
dozen
four
inch
screws
through
the
door
of
this
cabin
there
no
good
never
came
o
this
cabin
yet
sir
and
that
all
about
it
there
been
four
lives
lost
out
here
to
my
own
remembrance
and
that
in
four
trips
better
give
it
up
sir
better
give
it
up
i
will
try
it
for
one
night
more
i
said
better
give
it
up
sir
better
give
it
up
it
a
precious
bad
job
repeated
the
workman
putting
his
tools
in
his
bag
and
leaving
the
cabin
but
my
spirits
had
risen
considerably
at
the
prospect
of
having
the
captain
company
and
i
made
up
my
mind
not
to
be
prevented
from
going
to
the
end
of
the
strange
business
i
abstained
from
welsh
and
grog
that
evening
and
did
not
even
join
in
the
customary
game
of
whist
i
wanted
to
be
quite
sure
of
my
nerves
and
my
vanity
made
me
anxious
to
make
a
good
figure
in
the
captain
eyes
iv
the
captain
was
one
of
those
splendidly
tough
and
cheerful
specimens
of
seafaring
humanity
whose
combined
courage
hardihood
and
calmness
in
difficulty
leads
them
naturally
into
high
positions
of
trust
he
was
not
the
man
to
be
led
away
by
an
idle
tale
and
the
mere
fact
that
he
was
willing
to
join
me
in
the
investigation
was
proof
that
he
thought
there
was
something
seriously
wrong
which
could
not
be
accounted
for
on
ordinary
theories
nor
laughed
down
as
a
common
superstition
to
some
extent
too
his
reputation
was
at
stake
as
well
as
the
reputation
of
the
ship
it
is
no
light
thing
to
lose
passengers
overboard
and
he
knew
it
about
ten
that
evening
as
i
was
smoking
a
last
cigar
he
came
up
to
me
and
drew
me
aside
from
the
beat
of
the
other
passengers
who
were
patrolling
the
deck
in
the
warm
darkness
this
is
a
serious
matter
brisbane
he
said
we
must
make
up
our
minds
either
way
to
be
disappointed
or
to
have
a
pretty
rough
time
of
it
you
see
i
can
not
afford
to
laugh
at
the
affair
and
i
will
ask
you
to
sign
your
name
to
a
statement
of
whatever
occurs
if
nothing
happens
we
will
try
it
again
and
next
day
are
you
ready
so
we
went
below
and
entered
the
as
we
went
in
i
could
see
robert
the
steward
who
stood
a
little
further
down
the
passage
watching
us
with
his
usual
grin
as
though
certain
that
something
dreadful
was
about
to
happen
the
captain
closed
the
door
behind
us
and
bolted
it
supposing
we
put
your
portmanteau
before
the
door
he
suggested
one
of
us
can
sit
on
it
nothing
can
get
out
then
is
the
port
screwed
down
i
found
it
as
i
had
left
it
in
the
morning
indeed
without
using
a
lever
as
i
had
done
no
one
could
have
opened
it
i
drew
back
the
curtains
of
the
upper
berth
so
that
i
could
see
well
into
it
by
the
captain
advice
i
lighted
my
and
placed
it
so
that
it
shone
upon
the
white
sheets
above
he
insisted
upon
sitting
on
the
portmanteau
declaring
that
he
wished
to
be
able
to
swear
that
he
had
sat
before
the
door
then
he
requested
me
to
search
the
thoroughly
an
operation
very
soon
accomplished
as
it
consisted
merely
in
looking
beneath
the
lower
berth
and
under
the
couch
below
the
porthole
the
spaces
were
quite
empty
it
is
impossible
for
any
human
being
to
get
in
i
said
or
for
any
human
being
to
open
the
port
very
good
said
the
captain
calmly
if
we
see
anything
now
it
must
be
either
imagination
or
something
supernatural
i
sat
down
on
the
edge
of
the
lower
berth
the
first
time
it
happened
said
the
captain
crossing
his
legs
and
leaning
back
against
the
door
was
in
march
the
passenger
who
slept
here
in
the
upper
berth
turned
out
to
have
been
a
lunatic
at
all
events
he
was
known
to
have
been
a
little
touched
and
he
had
taken
his
passage
without
the
knowledge
of
his
friends
he
rushed
out
in
the
middle
of
the
night
and
threw
himself
overboard
before
the
officer
who
had
the
watch
could
stop
him
we
stopped
and
lowered
a
boat
it
was
a
quiet
night
just
before
that
heavy
weather
came
on
but
we
could
not
find
him
of
course
his
suicide
was
afterwards
accounted
for
on
the
ground
of
his
insanity
i
suppose
that
often
happens
i
remarked
rather
absently
not
often
no
said
the
captain
never
before
in
my
experience
though
i
have
heard
of
it
happening
on
board
of
other
ships
well
as
i
was
saying
that
occurred
in
march
on
the
very
next
trip
what
are
you
looking
at
he
asked
stopping
suddenly
in
his
narration
i
believe
i
gave
no
answer
my
eyes
were
riveted
upon
the
porthole
it
seemed
to
me
that
the
brass
was
beginning
to
turn
very
slowly
upon
the
screw
so
slowly
however
that
i
was
not
sure
it
moved
at
all
i
watched
it
intently
fixing
its
position
in
my
mind
and
trying
to
ascertain
whether
it
changed
seeing
where
i
was
looking
the
captain
looked
too
it
moves
he
exclaimed
in
a
tone
of
conviction
no
it
does
not
he
added
after
a
minute
if
it
were
the
jarring
of
the
screw
said
i
it
would
have
opened
during
the
day
but
i
found
it
this
evening
jammed
tight
as
i
left
it
this
morning
i
rose
and
tried
the
nut
it
was
certainly
loosened
for
by
an
effort
i
could
move
it
with
my
hands
the
queer
thing
said
the
captain
is
that
the
second
man
who
was
lost
is
supposed
to
have
got
through
that
very
port
we
had
a
terrible
time
over
it
it
was
in
the
middle
of
the
night
and
the
weather
was
very
heavy
there
was
an
alarm
that
one
of
the
ports
was
open
and
the
sea
running
in
i
came
below
and
found
everything
flooded
the
water
pouring
in
every
time
she
rolled
and
the
whole
port
swinging
from
the
top
bolts
not
the
porthole
in
the
middle
well
we
managed
to
shut
it
but
the
water
did
some
damage
ever
since
that
the
place
smells
of
from
time
to
time
we
supposed
the
passenger
had
thrown
himself
out
though
the
lord
only
knows
how
he
did
it
the
steward
kept
telling
me
that
he
could
not
keep
anything
shut
here
upon
my
word
i
can
smell
it
now
can
not
you
he
inquired
sniffing
the
air
suspiciously
yes
distinctly
i
said
and
i
shuddered
as
that
same
odour
of
stagnant
grew
stronger
in
the
cabin
now
to
smell
like
this
the
place
must
be
damp
i
continued
and
yet
when
i
examined
it
with
the
carpenter
this
morning
everything
was
perfectly
dry
it
is
most
extraordinary
hallo
my
which
had
been
placed
in
the
upper
berth
was
suddenly
extinguished
there
was
still
a
good
deal
of
light
from
the
pane
of
ground
glass
near
the
door
behind
which
loomed
the
regulation
lamp
the
ship
rolled
heavily
and
the
curtain
of
the
upper
berth
swung
far
out
into
the
and
back
again
i
rose
quickly
from
my
seat
on
the
edge
of
the
bed
and
the
captain
at
the
same
moment
started
to
his
feet
with
a
loud
cry
of
surprise
i
had
turned
with
the
intention
of
taking
down
the
lantern
to
examine
it
when
i
heard
his
exclamation
and
immediately
afterwards
his
call
for
help
i
sprang
towards
him
he
was
wrestling
with
all
his
might
with
the
brass
loop
of
the
port
it
seemed
to
turn
against
his
hands
in
spite
of
all
his
efforts
i
caught
up
my
cane
a
heavy
oak
stick
i
always
used
to
carry
and
thrust
it
through
the
ring
and
bore
on
it
with
all
my
strength
but
the
strong
wood
snapped
suddenly
and
i
fell
upon
the
couch
when
i
rose
again
the
port
was
wide
open
and
the
captain
was
standing
with
his
back
against
the
door
pale
to
the
lips
there
is
something
in
that
berth
he
cried
in
a
strange
voice
his
eyes
almost
starting
from
his
head
hold
the
door
while
i
look
it
shall
not
escape
us
whatever
it
is
but
instead
of
taking
his
place
i
sprang
upon
the
lower
bed
and
seized
something
which
lay
in
the
upper
berth
it
was
something
ghostly
horrible
beyond
words
and
it
moved
in
my
grip
it
was
like
the
body
of
a
man
long
drowned
and
yet
it
moved
and
had
the
strength
of
ten
men
living
but
i
gripped
it
with
all
my
might
the
slippery
oozy
horrible
thing
the
dead
white
eyes
seemed
to
stare
at
me
out
of
the
dusk
the
putrid
odour
of
rank
was
about
it
and
its
shiny
hair
hung
in
foul
wet
curls
over
its
dead
face
i
wrestled
with
the
dead
thing
it
thrust
itself
upon
me
and
forced
me
back
and
nearly
broke
my
arms
it
wound
its
corpse
arms
about
my
neck
the
living
death
and
overpowered
me
so
that
i
at
last
cried
aloud
and
fell
and
left
my
hold
as
i
fell
the
thing
sprang
across
me
and
seemed
to
throw
itself
upon
the
captain
when
i
last
saw
him
on
his
feet
his
face
was
white
and
his
lips
set
it
seemed
to
me
that
he
struck
a
violent
blow
at
the
dead
being
and
then
he
too
fell
forward
upon
his
face
with
an
inarticulate
cry
of
horror
the
thing
paused
an
instant
seeming
to
hover
over
his
prostrate
body
and
i
could
have
screamed
again
for
very
fright
but
i
had
no
voice
left
the
thing
vanished
suddenly
and
it
seemed
to
my
disturbed
senses
that
it
made
its
exit
through
the
open
port
though
how
that
was
possible
considering
the
smallness
of
the
aperture
is
more
than
any
one
can
tell
i
lay
a
long
time
upon
the
floor
and
the
captain
lay
beside
me
at
last
i
partially
recovered
my
senses
and
moved
and
i
instantly
knew
that
my
arm
was
broken
the
small
bone
of
the
left
forearm
near
the
wrist
i
got
upon
my
feet
somehow
and
with
my
remaining
hand
i
tried
to
raise
the
captain
he
groaned
and
moved
and
at
last
came
to
himself
he
was
not
hurt
but
he
seemed
badly
stunned
well
do
you
want
to
hear
any
more
there
is
nothing
more
that
is
the
end
of
my
story
the
carpenter
carried
out
his
scheme
of
running
half
a
dozen
screws
through
the
door
of
one
hundred
and
five
and
if
ever
you
take
a
passage
in
the
you
may
ask
for
a
berth
in
that
you
will
be
told
that
it
is
engaged
yes
it
is
engaged
by
that
dead
thing
i
finished
the
trip
in
the
surgeon
cabin
he
doctored
my
broken
arm
and
advised
me
not
to
fiddle
about
with
ghosts
and
things
any
more
the
captain
was
very
silent
and
never
sailed
again
in
that
ship
though
it
is
still
running
and
i
will
not
sail
in
her
either
it
was
a
very
disagreeable
experience
and
i
was
very
badly
frightened
which
is
a
thing
i
do
not
like
that
is
all
that
is
how
i
saw
a
ghost
if
it
was
a
ghost
it
was
dead
anyhow
by
the
waters
of
paradise
the
waters
of
i
remember
my
childhood
very
distinctly
i
do
not
think
that
the
fact
argues
a
good
memory
for
i
have
never
been
clever
at
learning
words
by
heart
in
prose
or
rhyme
so
that
i
believe
my
remembrance
of
events
depends
much
more
upon
the
events
themselves
than
upon
my
possessing
any
special
facility
for
recalling
them
perhaps
i
am
too
imaginative
and
the
earliest
impressions
i
received
were
of
a
kind
to
stimulate
the
imagination
abnormally
a
long
series
of
little
misfortunes
connected
with
each
other
as
to
suggest
a
sort
of
weird
fatality
so
worked
upon
my
melancholy
temperament
when
i
was
a
boy
that
before
i
was
of
age
i
sincerely
believed
myself
to
be
under
a
curse
and
not
only
myself
but
my
whole
family
and
every
individual
who
bore
my
name
i
was
born
in
the
old
place
where
my
father
and
his
father
and
all
his
predecessors
had
been
born
beyond
the
memory
of
man
it
is
a
very
old
house
and
the
greater
part
of
it
was
originally
a
castle
strongly
fortified
and
surrounded
by
a
deep
moat
supplied
with
abundant
water
from
the
hills
by
a
hidden
aqueduct
many
of
the
fortifications
have
been
destroyed
and
the
moat
has
been
filled
up
the
water
from
the
aqueduct
supplies
great
fountains
and
runs
down
into
huge
oblong
basins
in
the
terraced
gardens
one
below
the
other
each
surrounded
by
a
broad
pavement
of
marble
between
the
water
and
the
the
waste
surplus
finally
escapes
through
an
artificial
grotto
some
thirty
yards
long
into
a
stream
flowing
down
through
the
park
to
the
meadows
beyond
and
thence
to
the
distant
river
the
buildings
were
extended
a
little
and
greatly
altered
more
than
two
hundred
years
ago
in
the
time
of
charles
but
since
then
little
has
been
done
to
improve
them
though
they
have
been
kept
in
fairly
good
repair
according
to
our
fortunes
in
the
gardens
there
are
terraces
and
huge
hedges
of
box
and
evergreen
some
of
which
used
to
be
clipped
into
shapes
of
animals
in
the
italian
style
i
can
remember
when
i
was
a
lad
how
i
used
to
try
to
make
out
what
the
trees
were
cut
to
represent
and
how
i
used
to
appeal
for
explanations
to
judith
my
welsh
nurse
she
dealt
in
a
strange
mythology
of
her
own
and
peopled
the
gardens
with
griffins
dragons
good
genii
and
bad
and
filled
my
mind
with
them
at
the
same
time
my
nursery
window
afforded
a
view
of
the
great
fountains
at
the
head
of
the
upper
basin
and
on
moonlight
nights
the
welshwoman
would
hold
me
up
to
the
glass
and
bid
me
look
at
the
mist
and
spray
rising
into
mysterious
shapes
moving
mystically
in
the
white
light
like
living
things
it
the
woman
of
the
water
she
used
to
say
and
sometimes
she
would
threaten
that
if
i
did
not
go
to
sleep
the
woman
of
the
water
would
steal
up
to
the
high
window
and
carry
me
away
in
her
wet
arms
the
place
was
gloomy
the
broad
basins
of
water
and
the
tall
evergreen
hedges
gave
it
a
funereal
look
and
the
marble
causeways
by
the
pools
might
have
been
made
of
tombstones
the
gray
and
walls
and
towers
without
the
dark
and
rooms
within
the
deep
mysterious
recesses
and
the
heavy
curtains
all
affected
my
spirits
i
was
silent
and
sad
from
my
childhood
there
was
a
great
clock
tower
above
from
which
the
hours
rang
dismally
during
the
day
and
tolled
like
a
knell
in
the
dead
of
night
there
was
no
light
nor
life
in
the
house
for
my
mother
was
a
helpless
invalid
and
my
father
had
grown
melancholy
in
his
long
task
of
caring
for
her
he
was
a
thin
dark
man
with
sad
eyes
kind
i
think
but
silent
and
unhappy
next
to
my
mother
i
believe
he
loved
me
better
than
anything
on
earth
for
he
took
immense
pains
and
trouble
in
teaching
me
and
what
he
taught
me
i
have
never
forgotten
perhaps
it
was
his
only
amusement
and
that
may
be
the
reason
why
i
had
no
nursery
governess
or
teacher
of
any
kind
while
he
lived
i
used
to
be
taken
to
see
my
mother
every
day
and
sometimes
twice
a
day
for
an
hour
at
a
time
then
i
sat
upon
a
little
stool
near
her
feet
and
she
would
ask
me
what
i
had
been
doing
and
what
i
wanted
to
do
i
daresay
she
saw
already
the
seeds
of
a
profound
melancholy
in
my
nature
for
she
looked
at
me
always
with
a
sad
smile
and
kissed
me
with
a
sigh
when
i
was
taken
away
one
night
when
i
was
just
six
years
old
i
lay
awake
in
the
nursery
the
door
was
not
quite
shut
and
the
welsh
nurse
was
sitting
sewing
in
the
next
room
suddenly
i
heard
her
groan
and
say
in
a
strange
voice
one
two
one
two
i
was
frightened
and
i
jumped
up
and
ran
to
the
door
barefooted
as
i
was
what
is
it
judith
i
cried
clinging
to
her
skirts
i
can
remember
the
look
in
her
strange
dark
eyes
as
she
answered
one
two
leaden
coffins
fallen
from
the
ceiling
she
crooned
working
herself
in
her
chair
one
two
a
light
coffin
and
a
heavy
coffin
falling
to
the
floor
then
she
seemed
to
notice
me
and
she
took
me
back
to
bed
and
sang
me
to
sleep
with
a
queer
old
welsh
song
i
do
not
know
how
it
was
but
the
impression
got
hold
of
me
that
she
had
meant
that
my
father
and
mother
were
going
to
die
very
soon
they
died
in
the
very
room
where
she
had
been
sitting
that
night
it
was
a
great
room
my
day
nursery
full
of
sun
when
there
was
any
and
when
the
days
were
dark
it
was
the
most
cheerful
place
in
the
house
my
mother
grew
rapidly
worse
and
i
was
transferred
to
another
part
of
the
building
to
make
place
for
her
they
thought
my
nursery
was
gayer
for
her
i
suppose
but
she
could
not
live
she
was
beautiful
when
she
was
dead
and
i
cried
bitterly
the
light
one
the
light
one
the
heavy
one
to
come
crooned
the
welshwoman
and
she
was
right
my
father
took
the
room
after
my
mother
was
gone
and
day
by
day
he
grew
thinner
and
paler
and
sadder
the
heavy
one
the
heavy
one
all
of
lead
moaned
my
nurse
one
night
in
december
standing
still
just
as
she
was
going
to
take
away
the
light
after
putting
me
to
bed
then
she
took
me
up
again
and
wrapped
me
in
a
little
gown
and
led
me
away
to
my
father
room
she
knocked
but
no
one
answered
she
opened
the
door
and
we
found
him
in
his
before
the
fire
very
white
quite
dead
so
i
was
alone
with
the
welshwoman
till
strange
people
came
and
relations
whom
i
had
never
seen
and
then
i
heard
them
saying
that
i
must
be
taken
away
to
some
more
cheerful
place
they
were
kind
people
and
i
will
not
believe
that
they
were
kind
only
because
i
was
to
be
very
rich
when
i
grew
to
be
a
man
the
world
never
seemed
to
be
a
very
bad
place
to
me
nor
all
the
people
to
be
miserable
sinners
even
when
i
was
most
melancholy
i
do
not
remember
that
any
one
ever
did
me
any
great
injustice
nor
that
i
was
ever
oppressed
or
in
any
way
even
by
the
boys
at
school
i
was
sad
i
suppose
because
my
childhood
was
so
gloomy
and
later
because
i
was
unlucky
in
everything
i
undertook
till
i
finally
believed
i
was
pursued
by
fate
and
i
used
to
dream
that
the
old
welsh
nurse
and
the
woman
of
the
water
between
them
had
vowed
to
pursue
me
to
my
end
but
my
natural
disposition
should
have
been
cheerful
as
i
have
often
thought
among
lads
of
my
age
i
was
never
last
or
even
among
the
last
in
anything
but
i
was
never
first
if
i
trained
for
a
race
i
was
sure
to
sprain
my
ankle
on
the
day
when
i
was
to
run
if
i
pulled
an
oar
with
others
my
oar
was
sure
to
break
if
i
competed
for
a
prize
some
unforeseen
accident
prevented
my
winning
it
at
the
last
moment
nothing
to
which
i
put
my
hand
succeeded
and
i
got
the
reputation
of
being
unlucky
until
my
companions
felt
it
was
always
safe
to
bet
against
me
no
matter
what
the
appearances
might
be
i
became
discouraged
and
listless
in
everything
i
gave
up
the
idea
of
competing
for
any
distinction
at
the
university
comforting
myself
with
the
thought
that
i
could
not
fail
in
the
examination
for
the
ordinary
degree
the
day
before
the
examination
began
i
fell
ill
and
when
at
last
i
recovered
after
a
narrow
escape
from
death
i
turned
my
back
upon
oxford
and
went
down
alone
to
visit
the
old
place
where
i
had
been
born
feeble
in
health
and
profoundly
disgusted
and
discouraged
i
was
years
of
age
master
of
myself
and
of
my
fortune
but
so
deeply
had
the
long
chain
of
small
unlucky
circumstances
affected
me
that
i
thought
seriously
of
shutting
myself
up
from
the
world
to
live
the
life
of
a
hermit
and
to
die
as
soon
as
possible
death
seemed
the
only
cheerful
possibility
in
my
existence
and
my
thoughts
soon
dwelt
upon
it
altogether
i
had
never
shown
any
wish
to
return
to
my
own
home
since
i
had
been
taken
away
as
a
little
boy
and
no
one
had
ever
pressed
me
to
do
so
the
place
had
been
kept
in
order
after
a
fashion
and
did
not
seem
to
have
suffered
during
the
fifteen
years
or
more
of
my
absence
nothing
earthly
could
affect
those
old
grey
walls
that
had
fought
the
elements
for
so
many
centuries
the
garden
was
more
wild
than
i
remembered
it
the
marble
causeways
about
the
pools
looked
more
yellow
and
damp
than
of
old
and
the
whole
place
at
first
looked
smaller
it
was
not
until
i
had
wandered
about
the
house
and
grounds
for
many
hours
that
i
realised
the
huge
size
of
the
home
where
i
was
to
live
in
solitude
then
i
began
to
delight
in
it
and
my
resolution
to
live
alone
grew
stronger
the
people
had
turned
out
to
welcome
me
of
course
and
i
tried
to
recognise
the
changed
faces
of
the
old
gardener
and
the
old
housekeeper
and
to
call
them
by
name
my
old
nurse
i
knew
at
once
she
had
grown
very
grey
since
she
heard
the
coffins
fall
in
the
nursery
fifteen
years
before
but
her
strange
eyes
were
the
same
and
the
look
in
them
woke
all
my
old
memories
she
went
over
the
house
with
me
and
how
is
the
woman
of
the
water
i
asked
trying
to
laugh
a
little
does
she
still
play
in
the
moonlight
she
is
hungry
answered
the
welshwoman
in
a
low
voice
hungry
then
we
will
feed
her
i
laughed
but
old
judith
turned
very
pale
and
looked
at
me
strangely
feed
her
ay
you
will
feed
her
well
she
muttered
glancing
behind
her
at
the
ancient
housekeeper
who
tottered
after
us
with
feeble
steps
through
the
halls
and
passages
i
did
not
think
much
of
her
words
she
had
always
talked
oddly
as
welshwomen
will
and
though
i
was
very
melancholy
i
am
sure
i
was
not
superstitious
and
i
was
certainly
not
timid
only
as
in
a
dream
i
seemed
to
see
her
standing
with
the
light
in
her
hand
and
muttering
the
heavy
one
all
of
lead
and
then
leading
a
little
boy
through
the
long
corridors
to
see
his
father
lying
dead
in
a
great
before
a
smouldering
fire
so
we
went
over
the
house
and
i
chose
the
rooms
where
i
would
live
and
the
servants
i
had
brought
with
me
ordered
and
arranged
everything
and
i
had
no
more
trouble
i
did
not
care
what
they
did
provided
i
was
left
in
peace
and
was
not
expected
to
give
directions
for
i
was
more
listless
than
ever
owing
to
the
effects
of
my
illness
at
college
i
dined
in
solitary
state
and
the
melancholy
grandeur
of
the
vast
old
pleased
me
then
i
went
to
the
room
i
had
selected
for
my
study
and
sat
down
in
a
deep
chair
under
a
bright
light
to
think
or
to
let
my
thoughts
meander
through
labyrinths
of
their
own
choosing
utterly
indifferent
to
the
course
they
might
take
the
tall
windows
of
the
room
opened
to
the
level
of
the
ground
upon
the
terrace
at
the
head
of
the
garden
it
was
in
the
end
of
july
and
everything
was
open
for
the
weather
was
warm
as
i
sat
alone
i
heard
the
unceasing
plash
of
the
great
fountains
and
i
fell
to
thinking
of
the
woman
of
the
water
i
rose
and
went
out
into
the
still
night
and
sat
down
upon
a
seat
on
the
terrace
between
two
gigantic
italian
the
air
was
deliciously
soft
and
sweet
with
the
smell
of
the
flowers
and
the
garden
was
more
congenial
to
me
than
the
house
sad
people
always
like
running
water
and
the
sound
of
it
at
night
though
i
can
not
tell
why
i
sat
and
listened
in
the
gloom
for
it
was
dark
below
and
the
pale
moon
had
not
yet
climbed
over
the
hills
in
front
of
me
though
all
the
air
above
was
light
with
her
rising
beams
slowly
the
white
halo
in
the
eastern
sky
ascended
in
an
arch
above
the
wooded
crests
making
the
outlines
of
the
mountains
more
intensely
black
by
contrast
as
though
the
head
of
some
great
white
saint
were
rising
from
behind
a
screen
in
a
vast
cathedral
throwing
misty
glories
from
below
i
longed
to
see
the
moon
herself
and
i
tried
to
reckon
the
seconds
before
she
must
appear
then
she
sprang
up
quickly
and
in
a
moment
more
hung
round
and
perfect
in
the
sky
i
gazed
at
her
and
then
at
the
floating
spray
of
the
tall
fountains
and
down
at
the
pools
where
the
were
rocking
softly
in
their
sleep
on
the
velvet
surface
of
the
water
just
then
a
great
swan
floated
out
silently
into
the
midst
of
the
basin
and
wreathed
his
long
neck
catching
the
water
in
his
broad
bill
and
scattering
showers
of
diamonds
around
him
suddenly
as
i
gazed
something
came
between
me
and
the
light
i
looked
up
instantly
between
me
and
the
round
disk
of
the
moon
rose
a
luminous
face
of
a
woman
with
great
strange
eyes
and
a
woman
mouth
full
and
soft
but
not
smiling
hooded
in
black
staring
at
me
as
i
sat
still
upon
my
bench
she
was
close
to
me
so
close
that
i
could
have
touched
her
with
my
hand
but
i
was
transfixed
and
helpless
she
stood
still
for
a
moment
but
her
expression
did
not
change
then
she
passed
swiftly
away
and
my
hair
stood
up
on
my
head
while
the
cold
breeze
from
her
white
dress
was
wafted
to
my
temples
as
she
moved
the
moonlight
shining
through
the
tossing
spray
of
the
fountain
made
traceries
of
shadow
on
the
gleaming
folds
of
her
garments
in
an
instant
she
was
gone
and
i
was
alone
i
was
strangely
shaken
by
the
vision
and
some
time
passed
before
i
could
rise
to
my
feet
for
i
was
still
weak
from
my
illness
and
the
sight
i
had
seen
would
have
startled
any
one
i
did
not
reason
with
myself
for
i
was
certain
that
i
had
looked
on
the
unearthly
and
no
argument
could
have
destroyed
that
belief
at
last
i
got
up
and
stood
unsteadily
gazing
in
the
direction
in
which
i
thought
the
face
had
gone
but
there
was
nothing
to
be
seen
nothing
but
the
broad
paths
the
tall
dark
evergreen
hedges
the
tossing
water
of
the
fountains
and
the
smooth
pool
below
i
fell
back
upon
the
seat
and
recalled
the
face
i
had
seen
strange
to
say
now
that
the
first
impression
had
passed
there
was
nothing
startling
in
the
recollection
on
the
contrary
i
felt
that
i
was
fascinated
by
the
face
and
would
give
anything
to
see
it
again
i
could
retrace
the
beautiful
straight
features
the
long
dark
eyes
and
the
wonderful
mouth
most
exactly
in
my
mind
and
when
i
had
reconstructed
every
detail
from
memory
i
knew
that
the
whole
was
beautiful
and
that
i
should
love
a
woman
with
such
a
face
i
wonder
whether
she
is
the
woman
of
the
water
i
said
to
myself
then
rising
once
more
i
wandered
down
the
garden
descending
one
short
flight
of
steps
after
another
from
terrace
to
terrace
by
the
edge
of
the
marble
basins
through
the
shadow
and
through
the
moonlight
and
i
crossed
the
water
by
the
rustic
bridge
above
the
artificial
grotto
and
climbed
slowly
up
again
to
the
highest
terrace
by
the
other
side
the
air
seemed
sweeter
and
i
was
very
calm
so
that
i
think
i
smiled
to
myself
as
i
walked
as
though
a
new
happiness
had
come
to
me
the
woman
face
seemed
always
before
me
and
the
thought
of
it
gave
me
an
unwonted
thrill
of
pleasure
unlike
anything
i
had
ever
felt
before
i
turned
as
i
reached
the
house
and
looked
back
upon
the
scene
it
had
certainly
changed
in
the
short
hour
since
i
had
come
out
and
my
mood
had
changed
with
it
just
like
my
luck
i
thought
to
fall
in
love
with
a
ghost
but
in
old
times
i
would
have
sighed
and
gone
to
bed
more
sad
than
ever
at
such
a
melancholy
conclusion
i
felt
happy
almost
for
the
first
time
in
my
life
the
gloomy
old
study
seemed
cheerful
when
i
went
in
the
old
pictures
on
the
walls
smiled
at
me
and
i
sat
down
in
my
deep
chair
with
a
new
and
delightful
sensation
that
i
was
not
alone
the
idea
of
having
seen
a
ghost
and
of
feeling
much
the
better
for
it
was
so
absurd
that
i
laughed
softly
as
i
took
up
one
of
the
books
i
had
brought
with
me
and
began
to
read
that
impression
did
not
wear
off
i
slept
peacefully
and
in
the
morning
i
threw
open
my
windows
to
the
summer
air
and
looked
down
at
the
garden
at
the
stretches
of
green
and
at
the
coloured
at
the
circling
swallows
and
at
the
bright
water
a
man
might
make
a
paradise
of
this
place
i
exclaimed
a
man
and
a
woman
together
from
that
day
the
old
castle
no
longer
seemed
gloomy
and
i
think
i
ceased
to
be
sad
for
some
time
too
i
began
to
take
an
interest
in
the
place
and
to
try
and
make
it
more
alive
i
avoided
my
old
welsh
nurse
lest
she
should
damp
my
humour
with
some
dismal
prophecy
and
recall
my
old
self
by
bringing
back
memories
of
my
dismal
childhood
but
what
i
thought
of
most
was
the
ghostly
figure
i
had
seen
in
the
garden
that
first
night
after
my
arrival
i
went
out
every
evening
and
wandered
through
the
walks
and
paths
but
try
as
i
might
i
did
not
see
my
vision
again
at
last
after
many
days
the
memory
grew
more
faint
and
my
old
moody
nature
gradually
overcame
the
temporary
sense
of
lightness
i
had
experienced
the
summer
turned
to
autumn
and
i
grew
restless
it
began
to
rain
the
dampness
pervaded
the
gardens
and
the
outer
halls
smelled
musty
like
tombs
the
grey
sky
oppressed
me
intolerably
i
left
the
place
as
it
was
and
went
abroad
determined
to
try
anything
which
might
possibly
make
a
second
break
in
the
monotonous
melancholy
from
which
i
suffered
ii
most
people
would
be
struck
by
the
utter
insignificance
of
the
small
events
which
after
the
death
of
my
parents
influenced
my
life
and
made
me
unhappy
the
gruesome
forebodings
of
a
welsh
nurse
which
chanced
to
be
realised
by
an
odd
coincidence
of
events
should
not
seem
enough
to
change
the
nature
of
a
child
and
to
direct
the
bent
of
his
character
in
after
years
the
little
disappointments
of
schoolboy
life
and
the
somewhat
less
childish
ones
of
an
uneventful
and
undistinguished
academic
career
should
not
have
sufficed
to
turn
me
out
at
years
of
age
a
melancholic
listless
idler
some
weakness
of
my
own
character
may
have
contributed
to
the
result
but
in
a
greater
degree
it
was
due
to
my
having
a
reputation
for
bad
luck
however
i
will
not
try
to
analyse
the
causes
of
my
state
for
i
should
satisfy
nobody
least
of
all
myself
still
less
will
i
attempt
to
explain
why
i
felt
a
temporary
revival
of
my
spirits
after
my
adventure
in
the
garden
it
is
certain
that
i
was
in
love
with
the
face
i
had
seen
and
that
i
longed
to
see
it
again
that
i
gave
up
all
hope
of
a
second
visitation
grew
more
sad
than
ever
packed
up
my
traps
and
finally
went
abroad
but
in
my
dreams
i
went
back
to
my
home
and
it
always
appeared
to
me
sunny
and
bright
as
it
had
looked
on
that
summer
morning
after
i
had
seen
the
woman
by
the
fountain
i
went
to
paris
i
went
further
and
wandered
about
germany
i
tried
to
amuse
myself
and
i
failed
miserably
with
the
aimless
whims
of
an
idle
and
useless
man
come
all
sorts
of
suggestions
for
good
resolutions
one
day
i
made
up
my
mind
that
i
would
go
and
bury
myself
in
a
german
university
for
a
time
and
live
simply
like
a
poor
student
i
started
with
the
intention
of
going
to
leipsic
determined
to
stay
there
until
some
event
should
direct
my
life
or
change
my
humour
or
make
an
end
of
me
altogether
the
express
train
stopped
at
some
station
of
which
i
did
not
know
the
name
it
was
dusk
on
a
winter
afternoon
and
i
peered
through
the
thick
glass
from
my
seat
suddenly
another
train
came
gliding
in
from
the
opposite
direction
and
stopped
alongside
of
ours
i
looked
at
the
carriage
which
chanced
to
be
abreast
of
mine
and
idly
read
the
black
letters
painted
on
a
white
board
swinging
from
the
brass
handrail
berlin
cologne
paris
then
i
looked
up
at
the
window
above
i
started
violently
and
the
cold
perspiration
broke
out
upon
my
forehead
in
the
dim
light
not
six
feet
from
where
i
sat
i
saw
the
face
of
a
woman
the
face
i
loved
the
straight
fine
features
the
strange
eyes
the
wonderful
mouth
the
pale
skin
her
was
a
dark
veil
which
seemed
to
be
tied
about
her
head
and
passed
over
the
shoulders
under
her
chin
as
i
threw
down
the
window
and
knelt
on
the
cushioned
seat
leaning
far
out
to
get
a
better
view
a
long
whistle
screamed
through
the
station
followed
by
a
quick
series
of
dull
clanking
sounds
then
there
was
a
slight
jerk
and
my
train
moved
on
luckily
the
window
was
narrow
being
the
one
over
the
seat
beside
the
door
or
i
believe
i
would
have
jumped
out
of
it
then
and
there
in
an
instant
the
speed
increased
and
i
was
being
carried
swiftly
away
in
the
opposite
direction
from
the
thing
i
loved
for
a
quarter
of
an
hour
i
lay
back
in
my
place
stunned
by
the
suddenness
of
the
apparition
at
last
one
of
the
two
other
passengers
a
large
and
gorgeous
captain
of
the
white
konigsberg
cuirassiers
civilly
but
firmly
suggested
that
i
might
shut
my
window
as
the
evening
was
cold
i
did
so
with
an
apology
and
relapsed
into
silence
the
train
ran
swiftly
on
for
a
long
time
and
it
was
already
beginning
to
slacken
speed
before
entering
another
station
when
i
roused
myself
and
made
a
sudden
resolution
as
the
carriage
stopped
before
the
brilliantly
lighted
platform
i
seized
my
belongings
saluted
my
and
got
out
determined
to
take
the
first
express
back
to
paris
this
time
the
circumstances
of
the
vision
had
been
so
natural
that
it
did
not
strike
me
that
there
was
anything
unreal
about
the
face
or
about
the
woman
to
whom
it
belonged
i
did
not
try
to
explain
to
myself
how
the
face
and
the
woman
could
be
travelling
by
a
fast
train
from
berlin
to
paris
on
a
winter
afternoon
when
both
were
in
my
mind
indelibly
associated
with
the
moonlight
and
the
fountains
in
my
own
english
home
i
certainly
would
not
have
admitted
that
i
had
been
mistaken
in
the
dusk
attributing
to
what
i
had
seen
a
resemblance
to
my
former
vision
which
did
not
really
exist
there
was
not
the
slightest
doubt
in
my
mind
and
i
was
positively
sure
that
i
had
again
seen
the
face
i
loved
i
did
not
hesitate
and
in
a
few
hours
i
was
on
my
way
back
to
paris
i
could
not
help
reflecting
on
my
ill
luck
wandering
as
i
had
been
for
many
months
it
might
as
easily
have
chanced
that
i
should
be
travelling
in
the
same
train
with
that
woman
instead
of
going
the
other
way
but
my
luck
was
destined
to
turn
for
a
time
i
searched
paris
for
several
days
i
dined
at
the
principal
hotels
i
went
to
the
theatres
i
rode
in
the
bois
de
boulogne
in
the
morning
and
picked
up
an
acquaintance
whom
i
forced
to
drive
with
me
in
the
afternoon
i
went
to
mass
at
the
madeleine
and
i
attended
the
services
at
the
english
church
i
hung
about
the
louvre
and
notre
dame
i
went
to
versailles
i
spent
hours
in
parading
the
rue
de
rivoli
in
the
neighbourhood
of
meurice
corner
where
foreigners
pass
and
repass
from
morning
till
night
at
last
i
received
an
invitation
to
a
reception
at
the
english
embassy
i
went
and
i
found
what
i
had
sought
so
long
there
she
was
sitting
by
an
old
lady
in
grey
satin
and
diamonds
who
had
a
wrinkled
but
kindly
face
and
keen
grey
eyes
that
seemed
to
take
in
everything
they
saw
with
very
little
inclination
to
give
much
in
return
but
i
did
not
notice
the
chaperon
i
saw
only
the
face
that
had
haunted
me
for
months
and
in
the
excitement
of
the
moment
i
walked
quickly
towards
the
pair
forgetting
such
a
trifle
as
the
necessity
for
an
introduction
she
was
far
more
beautiful
than
i
had
thought
but
i
never
doubted
that
it
was
she
herself
and
no
other
vision
or
no
vision
before
this
was
the
reality
and
i
knew
it
twice
her
hair
had
been
covered
now
at
last
i
saw
it
and
the
added
beauty
of
its
magnificence
glorified
the
whole
woman
it
was
rich
hair
fine
and
abundant
golden
with
deep
ruddy
tints
in
it
like
red
bronze
spun
fine
there
was
no
ornament
in
it
not
a
rose
not
a
thread
of
gold
and
i
felt
that
it
needed
nothing
to
enhance
its
splendour
nothing
but
her
pale
face
her
dark
strange
eyes
and
her
heavy
eyebrows
i
could
see
that
she
was
slender
too
but
strong
withal
as
she
sat
there
quietly
gazing
at
the
moving
scene
in
the
midst
of
the
brilliant
lights
and
the
hum
of
perpetual
conversation
i
recollected
the
detail
of
introduction
in
time
and
turned
aside
to
look
for
my
host
i
found
him
at
last
i
begged
him
to
present
me
to
the
two
ladies
pointing
them
out
to
him
at
the
same
time
yes
uh
by
all
means
uh
replied
his
excellency
with
a
pleasant
smile
he
evidently
had
no
idea
of
my
name
which
was
not
to
be
wondered
at
i
am
lord
cairngorm
i
observed
oh
by
all
means
answered
the
ambassador
with
the
same
hospitable
smile
yes
uh
the
fact
is
i
must
try
and
find
out
who
they
are
such
lots
of
people
you
know
oh
if
you
will
present
me
i
will
try
and
find
out
for
you
said
i
laughing
ah
yes
so
kind
of
you
come
along
said
my
host
we
threaded
the
crowd
and
in
a
few
minutes
we
stood
before
the
two
ladies
l
cairngorm
he
said
then
adding
quickly
to
me
come
and
dine
wo
you
he
glided
away
with
his
pleasant
smile
and
disappeared
in
the
crowd
i
sat
down
beside
the
beautiful
girl
conscious
that
the
eyes
of
the
duenna
were
upon
me
i
think
we
have
been
very
near
meeting
before
i
remarked
by
way
of
opening
the
conversation
my
companion
turned
her
eyes
full
upon
me
with
an
air
of
inquiry
she
evidently
did
not
recall
my
face
if
she
had
ever
seen
me
really
i
can
not
remember
she
observed
in
a
low
and
musical
voice
when
in
the
first
place
you
came
down
from
berlin
by
the
express
ten
days
ago
i
was
going
the
other
way
and
our
carriages
stopped
opposite
each
other
i
saw
you
at
the
window
yes
we
came
that
way
but
i
do
not
remember
she
hesitated
secondly
i
continued
i
was
sitting
alone
in
my
garden
last
summer
near
the
end
of
july
do
you
remember
you
must
have
wandered
in
there
through
the
park
you
came
up
to
the
house
and
looked
at
me
was
that
you
she
asked
in
evident
surprise
then
she
broke
into
a
laugh
i
told
everybody
i
had
seen
a
ghost
there
had
never
been
any
cairngorms
in
the
place
since
the
memory
of
man
we
left
the
next
day
and
never
heard
that
you
had
come
there
indeed
i
did
not
know
the
castle
belonged
to
you
where
were
you
staying
i
asked
where
why
with
my
aunt
where
i
always
stay
she
is
your
neighbour
since
it
you
i
beg
your
pardon
but
then
is
your
aunt
lady
bluebell
i
did
not
quite
catch
do
be
afraid
she
is
amazingly
deaf
yes
she
is
the
relict
of
my
beloved
uncle
the
sixteenth
or
seventeenth
baron
bluebell
i
forget
exactly
how
many
of
them
there
have
been
and
i
do
you
know
who
i
am
she
laughed
well
knowing
that
i
did
not
no
i
answered
frankly
i
have
not
the
least
idea
i
asked
to
be
introduced
because
i
recognised
you
perhaps
perhaps
you
are
a
miss
bluebell
considering
that
you
are
a
neighbour
i
will
tell
you
who
i
am
she
answered
no
i
am
of
the
tribe
of
bluebells
but
my
name
is
lammas
and
i
have
been
given
to
understand
that
i
was
christened
margaret
being
a
floral
family
they
call
me
daisy
a
dreadful
american
man
once
told
me
that
my
aunt
was
a
bluebell
and
that
i
was
a
harebell
with
two
l
and
an
e
because
my
hair
is
so
thick
i
warn
you
so
that
you
may
avoid
making
such
a
bad
pun
do
i
look
like
a
man
who
makes
puns
i
asked
being
very
conscious
of
my
melancholy
face
and
sad
looks
miss
lammas
eyed
me
critically
no
you
have
a
mournful
temperament
i
think
i
can
trust
you
she
answered
do
you
think
you
could
communicate
to
my
aunt
the
fact
that
you
are
a
cairngorm
and
a
neighbour
i
am
sure
she
would
like
to
know
i
leaned
towards
the
old
lady
inflating
my
lungs
for
a
yell
but
miss
lammas
stopped
me
that
is
not
of
the
slightest
use
she
remarked
you
can
write
it
on
a
bit
of
paper
she
is
utterly
deaf
i
have
a
pencil
i
answered
but
i
have
no
paper
would
my
cuff
do
do
you
think
oh
yes
replied
miss
lammas
with
alacrity
men
often
do
that
i
wrote
on
my
cuff
miss
lammas
wishes
me
to
explain
that
i
am
your
neighbour
cairngorm
then
i
held
out
my
arm
before
the
old
nose
she
seemed
perfectly
accustomed
to
the
proceeding
put
up
her
glasses
read
the
words
smiled
nodded
and
addressed
me
in
the
unearthly
voice
peculiar
to
people
who
hear
nothing
i
knew
your
grandfather
very
well
she
said
then
she
smiled
and
nodded
to
me
again
and
to
her
niece
and
relapsed
into
silence
it
is
all
right
remarked
miss
lammas
aunt
bluebell
knows
she
is
deaf
and
does
not
say
much
like
the
parrot
you
see
she
knew
your
grandfather
how
odd
that
we
should
be
neighbours
why
have
we
never
met
before
if
you
had
told
me
you
knew
my
grandfather
when
you
appeared
in
the
garden
i
should
not
have
been
in
the
least
surprised
i
answered
rather
irrelevantly
i
really
thought
you
were
the
ghost
of
the
old
fountain
how
in
the
world
did
you
come
there
at
that
hour
we
were
a
large
party
and
we
went
out
for
a
walk
then
we
thought
we
should
like
to
see
what
your
park
was
like
in
the
moonlight
and
so
we
trespassed
i
got
separated
from
the
rest
and
came
upon
you
by
accident
just
as
i
was
admiring
the
extremely
ghostly
look
of
your
house
and
wondering
whether
anybody
would
ever
come
and
live
there
again
it
looks
like
the
castle
of
macbeth
or
a
scene
from
the
opera
do
you
know
anybody
here
hardly
a
soul
do
you
no
aunt
bluebell
said
it
was
our
duty
to
come
it
is
easy
for
her
to
go
out
she
does
not
bear
the
burden
of
the
conversation
i
am
sorry
you
find
it
a
burden
said
i
shall
i
go
away
miss
lammas
looked
at
me
with
a
sudden
gravity
in
her
beautiful
eyes
and
there
was
a
sort
of
hesitation
about
the
lines
of
her
full
soft
mouth
no
she
said
at
last
quite
simply
do
go
away
we
may
like
each
other
if
you
stay
a
little
longer
and
we
ought
to
because
we
are
neighbours
in
the
country
i
suppose
i
ought
to
have
thought
miss
lammas
a
very
odd
girl
there
is
indeed
a
sort
of
freemasonry
between
people
who
discover
that
they
live
near
each
other
and
that
they
ought
to
have
known
each
other
before
but
there
was
a
sort
of
unexpected
frankness
and
simplicity
in
the
girl
amusing
manner
which
would
have
struck
any
one
else
as
being
singular
to
say
the
least
of
it
to
me
however
it
all
seemed
natural
enough
i
had
dreamed
of
her
face
too
long
not
to
be
utterly
happy
when
i
met
her
at
last
and
could
talk
to
her
as
much
as
i
pleased
to
me
the
man
of
ill
luck
in
everything
the
whole
meeting
seemed
too
good
to
be
true
i
felt
again
that
strange
sensation
of
lightness
which
i
had
experienced
after
i
had
seen
her
face
in
the
garden
the
great
rooms
seemed
brighter
life
seemed
worth
living
my
sluggish
melancholy
blood
ran
faster
and
filled
me
with
a
new
sense
of
strength
i
said
to
myself
that
without
this
woman
i
was
but
an
imperfect
being
but
that
with
her
i
could
accomplish
everything
to
which
i
should
set
my
hand
like
the
great
doctor
when
he
thought
he
had
cheated
mephistopheles
at
last
i
could
have
cried
aloud
to
the
fleeting
moment
doch
du
bist
so
schön
are
you
always
gay
i
asked
suddenly
how
happy
you
must
be
the
days
would
sometimes
seem
very
long
if
i
were
gloomy
she
answered
thoughtfully
yes
i
think
i
find
life
very
pleasant
and
i
tell
it
so
how
can
you
life
anything
i
inquired
if
i
could
catch
my
life
and
talk
to
it
i
would
abuse
it
prodigiously
i
assure
you
i
daresay
you
have
a
melancholy
temper
you
ought
to
live
out
of
doors
dig
potatoes
make
hay
shoot
hunt
tumble
into
ditches
and
come
home
muddy
and
hungry
for
dinner
it
would
be
much
better
for
you
than
moping
in
your
rook
tower
and
hating
everything
it
is
rather
lonely
down
there
i
murmured
apologetically
feeling
that
miss
lammas
was
quite
right
then
marry
and
quarrel
with
your
wife
she
laughed
anything
is
better
than
being
alone
i
am
a
very
peaceable
person
i
never
quarrel
with
anybody
you
can
try
it
you
will
find
it
quite
impossible
will
you
let
me
try
she
asked
still
smiling
by
all
means
especially
if
it
is
to
be
only
a
preliminary
canter
i
answered
rashly
what
do
you
mean
she
inquired
turning
quickly
upon
me
oh
nothing
you
might
try
my
paces
with
a
view
to
quarrelling
in
the
future
i
can
not
imagine
how
you
are
going
to
do
it
you
will
have
to
resort
to
immediate
and
direct
abuse
no
i
will
only
say
that
if
you
do
not
like
your
life
it
is
your
own
fault
how
can
a
man
of
your
age
talk
of
being
melancholy
or
of
the
hollowness
of
existence
are
you
consumptive
are
you
subject
to
hereditary
insanity
are
you
deaf
like
aunt
bluebell
are
you
poor
like
lots
of
people
have
you
been
crossed
in
love
have
you
lost
the
world
for
a
woman
or
any
particular
woman
for
the
sake
of
the
world
are
you
a
cripple
an
outcast
are
you
repulsively
ugly
she
laughed
again
is
there
any
reason
in
the
world
why
you
should
not
enjoy
all
you
have
got
in
life
no
there
is
no
reason
whatever
except
that
i
am
dreadfully
unlucky
especially
in
small
things
then
try
big
things
just
for
a
change
suggested
miss
lammas
try
and
get
married
for
instance
and
see
how
it
turns
out
if
it
turned
out
badly
it
would
be
rather
serious
not
half
so
serious
as
it
is
to
abuse
everything
unreasonably
if
abuse
is
your
particular
talent
abuse
something
that
ought
to
be
abused
abuse
the
conservatives
or
the
liberals
it
does
not
matter
which
since
they
are
always
abusing
each
other
make
yourself
felt
by
other
people
you
will
like
it
if
they
do
it
will
make
a
man
of
you
fill
your
mouth
with
pebbles
and
howl
at
the
sea
if
you
can
not
do
anything
else
it
did
demosthenes
no
end
of
good
you
know
you
will
have
the
satisfaction
of
imitating
a
great
man
really
miss
lammas
i
think
the
list
of
innocent
exercises
you
propose
very
well
if
you
do
care
for
that
sort
of
thing
care
for
some
other
sort
of
thing
care
for
something
or
hate
something
do
be
idle
life
is
short
and
though
art
may
be
long
plenty
of
noise
answers
nearly
as
well
i
do
care
for
something
i
mean
somebody
i
said
a
woman
then
marry
her
do
hesitate
i
do
not
know
whether
she
would
marry
me
i
replied
i
have
never
asked
her
then
ask
her
at
once
answered
miss
lammas
i
shall
die
happy
if
i
feel
i
have
persuaded
a
melancholy
to
rouse
himself
to
action
ask
her
by
all
means
and
see
what
she
says
if
she
does
not
accept
you
at
once
she
may
take
you
the
next
time
meanwhile
you
will
have
entered
for
the
race
if
you
lose
there
are
the
trial
stakes
and
the
race
and
plenty
of
selling
races
into
the
bargain
shall
i
take
you
at
your
word
miss
lammas
i
hope
you
will
she
answered
since
you
yourself
advise
me
i
will
miss
lammas
will
you
do
me
the
honour
to
marry
me
for
the
first
time
in
my
life
the
blood
rushed
to
my
head
and
my
sight
swam
i
can
not
tell
why
i
said
it
it
would
be
useless
to
try
to
explain
the
extraordinary
fascination
the
girl
exercised
over
me
nor
the
still
more
extraordinary
feeling
of
intimacy
with
her
which
had
grown
in
me
during
that
lonely
sad
unlucky
as
i
had
been
all
my
life
i
was
certainly
not
timid
nor
even
shy
but
to
propose
to
marry
a
woman
after
half
an
hour
acquaintance
was
a
piece
of
madness
of
which
i
never
believed
myself
capable
and
of
which
i
should
never
be
capable
again
could
i
be
placed
in
the
same
situation
it
was
as
though
my
whole
being
had
been
changed
in
a
moment
by
magic
by
the
white
magic
of
her
nature
brought
into
contact
with
mine
the
blood
sank
back
to
my
heart
and
a
moment
later
i
found
myself
staring
at
her
with
anxious
eyes
to
my
amazement
she
was
as
calm
as
ever
but
her
beautiful
mouth
smiled
and
there
was
a
mischievous
light
in
her
eyes
fairly
caught
she
answered
for
an
individual
who
pretends
to
be
listless
and
sad
you
are
not
lacking
in
humour
i
had
really
not
the
least
idea
what
you
were
going
to
say
would
it
be
singularly
awkward
for
you
if
i
had
said
i
never
saw
anybody
begin
to
practise
so
sharply
what
was
preached
to
him
with
so
very
little
loss
of
time
you
probably
never
met
a
man
who
had
dreamed
of
you
for
seven
months
before
being
introduced
no
i
never
did
she
answered
gaily
it
smacks
of
the
romantic
perhaps
you
are
a
romantic
character
after
all
i
should
think
you
were
if
i
believed
you
very
well
you
have
taken
my
advice
entered
for
a
stranger
race
and
lost
it
try
the
trial
stakes
you
have
another
cuff
and
a
pencil
propose
to
aunt
bluebell
she
would
dance
with
astonishment
and
she
might
recover
her
hearing
iii
that
was
how
i
first
asked
margaret
lammas
to
be
my
wife
and
i
will
agree
with
any
one
who
says
i
behaved
very
foolishly
but
i
have
not
repented
of
it
and
i
never
shall
i
have
long
ago
understood
that
i
was
out
of
my
mind
that
evening
but
i
think
my
temporary
insanity
on
that
occasion
has
had
the
effect
of
making
me
a
saner
man
ever
since
her
manner
turned
my
head
for
it
was
so
different
from
what
i
had
expected
to
hear
this
lovely
creature
who
in
my
imagination
was
a
heroine
of
romance
if
not
of
tragedy
talking
familiarly
and
laughing
readily
was
more
than
my
equanimity
could
bear
and
i
lost
my
head
as
well
as
my
heart
but
when
i
went
back
to
england
in
the
spring
i
went
to
make
certain
arrangements
at
the
castle
certain
changes
and
improvements
which
would
be
absolutely
necessary
i
had
won
the
race
for
which
i
had
entered
myself
so
rashly
and
we
were
to
be
married
in
june
whether
the
change
was
due
to
the
orders
i
had
left
with
the
gardener
and
the
rest
of
the
servants
or
to
my
own
state
of
mind
i
can
not
tell
at
all
events
the
old
place
did
not
look
the
same
to
me
when
i
opened
my
window
on
the
morning
after
my
arrival
there
were
the
grey
walls
below
me
and
the
grey
turrets
flanking
the
huge
building
there
were
the
fountains
the
marble
causeways
the
smooth
basins
the
tall
box
hedges
the
and
the
swans
just
as
of
old
but
there
was
something
else
there
too
something
in
the
air
in
the
water
and
in
the
greenness
that
i
did
not
recognise
a
light
over
everything
by
which
everything
was
transfigured
the
clock
in
the
tower
struck
seven
and
the
strokes
of
the
ancient
bell
sounded
like
a
wedding
chime
the
air
sang
with
the
thrilling
treble
of
the
songbirds
with
the
silvery
music
of
the
plashing
water
and
the
softer
harmony
of
the
leaves
stirred
by
the
fresh
morning
wind
there
was
a
smell
of
hay
from
the
distant
meadows
and
of
blooming
roses
from
the
beds
below
wafted
up
together
to
my
window
i
stood
in
the
pure
sunshine
and
drank
the
air
and
all
the
sounds
and
the
odours
that
were
in
it
and
i
looked
down
at
my
garden
and
said
it
is
paradise
after
all
i
think
the
men
of
old
were
right
when
they
called
heaven
a
garden
and
eden
a
garden
inhabited
by
one
man
and
one
woman
the
earthly
paradise
i
turned
away
wondering
what
had
become
of
the
gloomy
memories
i
had
always
associated
with
my
home
i
tried
to
recall
the
impression
of
my
nurse
horrible
prophecy
before
the
death
of
my
parents
an
impression
which
hitherto
had
been
vivid
enough
i
tried
to
remember
my
old
self
my
dejection
my
listlessness
my
bad
luck
and
my
petty
disappointments
i
endeavoured
to
force
myself
to
think
as
i
used
to
think
if
only
to
satisfy
myself
that
i
had
not
lost
my
individuality
but
i
succeeded
in
none
of
these
efforts
i
was
a
different
man
a
changed
being
incapable
of
sorrow
of
ill
luck
or
of
sadness
my
life
had
been
a
dream
not
evil
but
infinitely
gloomy
and
hopeless
it
was
now
a
reality
full
of
hope
gladness
and
all
manner
of
good
my
home
had
been
like
a
tomb
it
was
paradise
my
heart
had
been
as
though
it
had
not
existed
it
beat
with
strength
and
youth
and
the
certainty
of
realised
happiness
i
revelled
in
the
beauty
of
the
world
and
called
loveliness
out
of
the
future
to
enjoy
it
before
time
should
bring
it
to
me
as
a
traveller
in
the
plains
looks
up
to
the
mountains
and
already
tastes
the
cool
air
through
the
dust
of
the
road
here
i
thought
we
will
live
and
live
for
years
there
we
will
sit
by
the
fountain
towards
evening
and
in
the
deep
moonlight
down
those
paths
we
will
wander
together
on
those
benches
we
will
rest
and
talk
among
those
eastern
hills
we
will
ride
through
the
soft
twilight
and
in
the
old
house
we
will
tell
tales
on
winter
nights
when
the
logs
burn
high
and
the
holly
berries
are
red
and
the
old
clock
tolls
out
the
dying
year
on
these
old
steps
in
these
dark
passages
and
stately
rooms
there
will
one
day
be
the
sound
of
little
pattering
feet
and
laughing
will
ring
up
to
the
vaults
of
the
ancient
hall
those
tiny
footsteps
shall
not
be
slow
and
sad
as
mine
were
nor
shall
the
childish
words
be
spoken
in
an
awed
whisper
no
gloomy
welshwoman
shall
people
the
dusky
corners
with
weird
horrors
nor
utter
horrid
prophecies
of
death
and
ghastly
things
all
shall
be
young
and
fresh
and
joyful
and
happy
and
we
will
turn
the
old
luck
again
and
forget
that
there
was
ever
any
sadness
so
i
thought
as
i
looked
out
of
my
window
that
morning
and
for
many
mornings
after
that
and
every
day
it
all
seemed
more
real
than
ever
before
and
much
nearer
but
the
old
nurse
looked
at
me
askance
and
muttered
odd
sayings
about
the
woman
of
the
water
i
cared
little
what
she
said
for
i
was
far
too
happy
at
last
the
time
came
near
for
the
wedding
lady
bluebell
and
all
the
tribe
of
bluebells
as
margaret
called
them
were
at
bluebell
grange
for
we
had
determined
to
be
married
in
the
country
and
to
come
straight
to
the
castle
afterwards
we
cared
little
for
travelling
and
not
at
all
for
a
crowded
ceremony
at
george
in
hanover
square
with
all
the
tiresome
formalities
afterwards
i
used
to
ride
over
to
the
grange
every
day
and
very
often
margaret
would
come
with
her
aunt
and
some
of
her
cousins
to
the
castle
i
was
suspicious
of
my
own
taste
and
was
only
too
glad
to
let
her
have
her
way
about
the
alterations
and
improvements
in
our
home
we
were
to
be
married
on
the
thirtieth
of
july
and
on
the
evening
of
the
margaret
drove
over
with
some
of
the
bluebell
party
in
the
long
summer
twilight
we
all
went
out
into
the
garden
naturally
enough
margaret
and
i
were
left
to
ourselves
and
we
wandered
down
by
the
marble
basins
it
is
an
odd
coincidence
i
said
it
was
on
this
very
night
last
year
that
i
first
saw
you
considering
that
it
is
the
month
of
july
answered
margaret
with
a
laugh
and
that
we
have
been
here
almost
every
day
i
do
think
the
coincidence
is
so
extraordinary
after
all
no
dear
said
i
i
suppose
not
i
do
know
why
it
struck
me
we
shall
very
likely
be
here
a
year
from
and
a
year
from
that
the
odd
thing
when
i
think
of
it
is
that
you
should
be
here
at
all
but
my
luck
has
turned
i
ought
not
to
think
anything
odd
that
happens
now
that
i
have
you
it
is
all
sure
to
be
good
a
slight
change
in
your
ideas
since
that
remarkable
performance
of
yours
in
paris
said
margaret
do
you
know
i
thought
you
were
the
most
extraordinary
man
i
had
ever
met
i
thought
you
were
the
most
charming
woman
i
had
ever
seen
i
naturally
did
not
want
to
lose
any
time
in
frivolities
i
took
you
at
your
word
i
followed
your
advice
i
asked
you
to
marry
me
and
this
is
the
delightful
result
what
the
matter
margaret
had
started
suddenly
and
her
hand
tightened
on
my
arm
an
old
woman
was
coming
up
the
path
and
was
close
to
us
before
we
saw
her
for
the
moon
had
risen
and
was
shining
full
in
our
faces
the
woman
turned
out
to
be
my
old
nurse
it
only
old
judith
dear
do
be
frightened
i
said
then
i
spoke
to
the
welshwoman
what
are
you
about
judith
have
you
been
feeding
the
woman
of
the
water
ay
when
the
clock
strikes
willie
my
lord
i
mean
muttered
the
old
creature
drawing
aside
to
let
us
pass
and
fixing
her
strange
eyes
on
margaret
face
what
does
she
mean
asked
margaret
when
we
had
gone
by
nothing
darling
the
old
thing
is
mildly
crazy
but
she
is
a
good
soul
we
went
on
in
silence
for
a
few
moments
and
came
to
the
rustic
bridge
just
above
the
artificial
grotto
through
which
the
water
ran
out
into
the
park
dark
and
swift
in
its
narrow
channel
we
stopped
and
leaned
on
the
wooden
rail
the
moon
was
now
behind
us
and
shone
full
upon
the
long
vista
of
basins
and
on
the
huge
walls
and
towers
of
the
castle
above
how
proud
you
ought
to
be
of
such
a
grand
old
place
said
margaret
softly
it
is
yours
now
darling
i
answered
you
have
as
good
a
right
to
love
it
as
i
but
i
only
love
it
because
you
are
to
live
in
it
dear
her
hand
stole
out
and
lay
on
mine
and
we
were
both
silent
just
then
the
clock
began
to
strike
far
off
in
the
tower
i
counted
eight
nine
ten
eleven
i
looked
at
my
watch
twelve
thirteen
i
laughed
the
bell
went
on
striking
the
old
clock
has
gone
crazy
like
judith
i
exclaimed
still
it
went
on
note
after
note
ringing
out
monotonously
through
the
still
air
we
leaned
over
the
rail
instinctively
looking
in
the
direction
whence
the
sound
came
on
and
on
it
went
i
counted
nearly
a
hundred
out
of
sheer
curiosity
for
i
understood
that
something
had
broken
and
that
the
thing
was
running
itself
down
suddenly
there
was
a
crack
as
of
breaking
wood
a
cry
and
a
heavy
splash
and
i
was
alone
clinging
to
the
broken
end
of
the
rail
of
the
rustic
bridge
i
do
not
think
i
hesitated
while
my
pulse
beat
twice
i
sprang
clear
of
the
bridge
into
the
black
rushing
water
dived
to
the
bottom
came
up
again
with
empty
hands
turned
and
swam
downwards
through
the
grotto
in
the
thick
darkness
plunging
and
diving
at
every
stroke
striking
my
head
and
hands
against
jagged
stones
and
sharp
corners
clutching
at
last
something
in
my
fingers
and
dragging
it
up
with
all
my
might
i
spoke
i
cried
aloud
but
there
was
no
answer
i
was
alone
in
the
pitchy
blackness
with
my
burden
and
the
house
was
five
hundred
yards
away
struggling
still
i
felt
the
ground
beneath
my
feet
i
saw
a
ray
of
moonlight
the
grotto
widened
and
the
deep
water
became
a
broad
and
shallow
brook
as
i
stumbled
over
the
stones
and
at
last
laid
body
on
the
bank
in
the
park
beyond
ay
willie
as
the
clock
struck
said
the
voice
of
judith
the
welsh
nurse
as
she
bent
down
and
looked
at
the
white
face
the
old
woman
must
have
turned
back
and
followed
us
seen
the
accident
and
slipped
out
by
the
lower
gate
of
the
garden
ay
she
groaned
you
have
fed
the
woman
of
the
water
this
night
willie
while
the
clock
was
striking
i
scarcely
heard
her
as
i
knelt
beside
the
lifeless
body
of
the
woman
i
loved
chafing
the
wet
white
temples
and
gazing
wildly
into
the
eyes
i
remember
only
the
first
returning
look
of
consciousness
the
first
heaving
breath
the
first
movement
of
those
dear
hands
stretching
out
towards
me
that
is
not
much
of
a
story
you
say
it
is
the
story
of
my
life
that
is
all
it
does
not
pretend
to
be
anything
else
old
judith
says
my
luck
turned
on
that
summer
night
when
i
was
struggling
in
the
water
to
save
all
that
was
worth
living
for
a
month
later
there
was
a
stone
bridge
above
the
grotto
and
margaret
and
i
stood
on
it
and
looked
up
at
the
moonlit
castle
as
we
had
done
once
before
and
as
we
have
done
many
times
since
for
all
those
things
happened
ten
years
ago
last
summer
and
this
is
the
tenth
christmas
eve
we
have
spent
together
by
the
roaring
logs
in
the
old
hall
talking
of
old
times
and
every
year
there
are
more
old
times
to
talk
of
there
are
boys
too
with
hair
and
eyes
like
their
mother
and
a
little
margaret
with
solemn
black
eyes
like
mine
why
could
not
she
look
like
her
mother
too
as
well
as
the
rest
of
them
the
world
is
very
bright
at
this
glorious
christmas
time
and
perhaps
there
is
little
use
in
calling
up
the
sadness
of
long
ago
unless
it
be
to
make
the
jolly
firelight
seem
more
cheerful
the
good
wife
face
look
gladder
and
to
give
the
children
laughter
a
merrier
ring
by
contrast
with
all
that
is
gone
perhaps
too
some
listless
melancholy
youth
who
feels
that
the
world
is
very
hollow
and
that
life
is
like
a
perpetual
funeral
service
just
as
i
used
to
feel
myself
may
take
courage
from
my
example
and
having
found
the
woman
of
his
heart
ask
her
to
marry
him
after
half
an
hour
acquaintance
but
on
the
whole
i
would
not
advise
any
man
to
marry
for
the
simple
reason
that
no
man
will
ever
find
a
wife
like
mine
and
being
obliged
to
go
further
he
will
necessarily
fare
worse
my
wife
has
done
miracles
but
i
will
not
assert
that
any
other
woman
is
able
to
follow
her
example
margaret
always
said
that
the
old
place
was
beautiful
and
that
i
ought
to
be
proud
of
it
i
daresay
she
is
right
she
has
even
more
imagination
than
i
but
i
have
a
good
answer
and
a
plain
one
which
is
this
that
all
the
beauty
of
the
castle
comes
from
her
she
has
breathed
upon
it
all
as
the
children
blow
upon
the
cold
glass
in
winter
and
as
their
warm
breath
crystallises
into
landscapes
from
fairyland
full
of
exquisite
shapes
and
traceries
upon
the
blank
surface
so
her
spirit
has
transformed
every
grey
stone
of
the
old
towers
every
ancient
tree
and
hedge
in
the
gardens
every
thought
in
my
once
melancholy
self
all
that
was
old
is
young
and
all
that
was
sad
is
glad
and
i
am
the
gladdest
of
all
whatever
heaven
may
be
there
is
no
earthly
paradise
without
woman
nor
is
there
anywhere
a
place
so
desolate
so
dreary
so
unutterably
miserable
that
a
woman
can
not
make
it
seem
heaven
to
the
man
she
loves
and
who
loves
her
i
hear
certain
cynics
laugh
and
cry
that
all
that
has
been
said
before
do
not
laugh
my
good
cynic
you
are
too
small
a
man
to
laugh
at
such
a
great
thing
as
love
prayers
have
been
said
before
now
by
many
and
perhaps
you
say
yours
too
i
do
not
think
they
lose
anything
by
being
repeated
nor
you
by
repeating
them
you
say
that
the
world
is
bitter
and
full
of
the
waters
of
bitterness
love
and
so
live
that
you
may
be
loved
the
world
will
turn
sweet
for
you
and
you
shall
rest
like
me

the
waters
